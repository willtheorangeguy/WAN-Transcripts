[0.00 --> 4.62]  keeping the twitch chat primed it is WAN show time and we have a great show for you guys today
[4.62 --> 7.92]  did you roast me at all because that's usually what i do with you when you're when you're late
[7.92 --> 13.84]  no i'm a nice person actually instead i was talking about how exciting it is that this
[13.84 --> 24.26]  is the last WAN show that will be exclusive to twitch tv i saw that coming yes yeah so uh i
[24.26 --> 30.52]  don't know if you saw but we streamed on the youtube channel today we had 25 000 concurrence
[30.52 --> 37.74]  i was there when you hit it watching me talk about iommu groups and virtualization imagine if
[37.74 --> 44.58]  we were doing something that people cared about imagine yeah this is my imagination face well one
[44.58 --> 51.86]  of the big things one of the like huge problems um and uh i can't say necessarily like what we talked
[51.86 --> 58.02]  about but when i was down at twitch a while ago we talked about like a side discussion of discoverability
[58.02 --> 64.60]  and searchability and stuff on twitch is horrible yep finding what you want on twitch is actually
[64.60 --> 71.08]  terrible in the last it's gotten a little better in the last four years linus media group has like
[71.08 --> 76.16]  tripled in terms of its youtube viewership oh yeah in terms of just every aspect of the business
[76.16 --> 80.98]  pretty much has probably tripled in the last four years except twitch viewership which is half of what
[80.98 --> 89.54]  it was then yeah and it's like either and remember too i'm talking WAN show archive as well yeah
[89.54 --> 95.20]  and like when when he's talking about how it's gone like almost in the same magnitude opposite
[95.20 --> 99.22]  direction when we were hosting the WAN show when we first got in this building yeah and it was in
[99.22 --> 106.48]  what we called the library yes we were consistently hitting 10k yeah so either it's us which it doesn't
[106.48 --> 112.22]  seem to be because literally every other platform streaming or VOD is going in the complete opposite
[112.22 --> 117.42]  direction yeah or it's something about twitch and the type of content i mean we used to be the only
[117.42 --> 123.08]  non-gaming content on the site which might have made us stand out more like there weren't any podcasts
[123.08 --> 127.88]  and they used to like that we were on there they used to care because we were pretty much the only
[127.88 --> 132.54]  version of that so they would promote us yeah and on twitch to to be relevant you basically have to be
[132.54 --> 138.34]  streaming a lot every day because the discoverability is terrible but there was something else too now i
[138.34 --> 142.88]  know it's not ready yet don't freak out but oh because we're going to be simulcast streaming
[142.88 --> 150.10]  yeah we might as well stream on flow plane and wait hold on i have a cool idea i have no issue
[150.10 --> 155.88]  with i'm gonna have to check with my my fp peeps in the chat here okay but what if we absolutely
[155.88 --> 163.42]  cranked like went absolutely bat crap crazy on the bitrate i think uh i think uh line of media group's
[163.42 --> 167.80]  gonna have to pony up for that oh yeah oh yeah is that what you think no because we're we're helping
[167.80 --> 174.66]  you beta test okay yeah okay that's right but hold on a second because even if our real-time transcode
[174.66 --> 180.78]  isn't working yet because we'll be simultaneously streaming floatplane pilots so i was thinking the
[180.78 --> 187.10]  chat that we focus on is the floatplane chat so if people want to chat on wanshow basically you can
[187.10 --> 191.06]  think of it kind of like twitch prime except you just actually pay linus media group instead of
[191.06 --> 194.96]  paying twitch a bunch of money also floatplane media is going to take some of it too but that's
[194.96 --> 200.52]  fine they're cool guys i'm expecting aj to yell at me pretty soon um but but get this if people if
[200.52 --> 207.00]  people can't handle like a 30 megabit stream like something absolutely nuts like we go crazy on it
[207.00 --> 212.12]  yeah if they can't handle it they just watch the video on twitch or youtube yeah whatever and they
[212.12 --> 216.62]  just use their floatplane chat then they still get the benefit of the floatplane membership and
[216.62 --> 221.48]  we can experiment with different kinds of streaming qualities and stuff like that i don't know i've
[221.48 --> 226.50]  done i've done pretty cool right i've done a bunch of streams on floatplane the quality and the the
[226.50 --> 230.90]  delay and everything is all really good so like i'm i'm sure it would 4k stream because i haven't done
[230.90 --> 237.98]  that i have not i have not done that um okay so one one thing to bring up here a little interesting
[237.98 --> 242.48]  to bring it up yes uh live on the thing yeah we haven't done it yet yeah we haven't we haven't
[242.48 --> 247.62]  had our floatplane lunch this week actually or last not even that yeah no i know so like we've got we've
[247.62 --> 250.96]  got lots of we got lots of updates because i got something really good for you as soon as you're
[250.96 --> 256.50]  done okay so go ahead you go this isn't actually about floatplane this is um yeah well sort of if you
[256.50 --> 262.18]  wanted to yeah yeah if you wanted to stream yes so you're out of the frame or or youtube if you
[262.18 --> 266.20]  want to stream on either of those right now i think you'd be breaking the contract with twitch
[266.20 --> 270.50]  because you have a sub button yeah i know they can kick us out so you have to yeah i would just
[270.50 --> 275.14]  be aware of that that's yeah yeah that's fine i think we get like a couple hundred dollars a month
[275.14 --> 278.62]  or something like that like yeah it's not gonna matter it's it's not gonna make or break i
[278.62 --> 284.88]  part are twitch subscribers of course but yeah compared to if you support us on floatplane
[284.88 --> 290.58]  yeah it's really not that helpful so literally linus media group will make more money out of that
[290.58 --> 296.76]  and then floatplane media gets supported too which is great yeah then luke might be able to afford a
[296.76 --> 306.26]  razor yeah okay get this so rough week um you know how floatplane needs like baller network connections
[306.26 --> 312.18]  and stuff for some of the things it does yeah i might be able to give floatplane access to uh you know
[312.18 --> 322.24]  vanix vancouver internet exchange yes yeah yeah so um linus media group might be upgrading its
[322.24 --> 329.84]  connection what to a dedicated wavelength whoa direct to vanix
[329.84 --> 344.00]  what okay wouldn't that mean that you basically have to be your own
[344.00 --> 351.06]  so we're we're working with it's a small time our isp although they've grown a lot since we first
[351.06 --> 356.32]  started working so it's through them they're pretty cool guys um because i was like you'd have to be
[356.32 --> 363.30]  your own isp i i've got i've got the cto's phone number and cell phone number like he replies to my
[363.30 --> 369.96]  emails at like two in the morning he's a super cool guy yeah yeah yeah freaking awesome um so i'm not
[369.96 --> 376.70]  gonna i'm not gonna like yeah i'm not gonna not gonna say too much but like our isp dope guys uh local
[376.70 --> 384.16]  guys um itel i don't you've probably never heard of them no but um great they're cool guys and anyway so
[384.16 --> 391.28]  so it's gonna be a dedicated 10 gigabit per second wavelength straight to vanix no switches
[391.28 --> 397.40]  um and then we're we're actually i couldn't afford the entire 10 gigabit per second
[397.40 --> 403.56]  of like internet access okay uh so it's gonna be 5.5 slumming it
[403.56 --> 409.94]  5.5 gig okay what's the i don't want to know the exact dollar value but what's the like
[409.94 --> 415.16]  differential i'll tell you i'll tell you after hold on but but but what's cool is that we're going
[415.16 --> 421.54]  to have because they're bros and because it doesn't cost them more because they're already in
[421.54 --> 432.12]  vanix anyone else in vanix we're gonna have 10 gig too so it's 5 gig 5.5 off vanix but then it's 10 gig
[432.12 --> 442.30]  to aws uh google um uh akamai uh like basically 10 gig to anyone that matters probably ov8
[442.30 --> 449.80]  probably you can go check it's got a list of everyone that's on there so anyway uh you guys
[449.80 --> 455.68]  could definitely have some rack space and uh i'm sure we could find a way to make that that extra you
[455.68 --> 460.98]  know 5 gigabit or whatever somewhat beneficial ov8 is on vanix so so we could that's pretty great
[460.98 --> 466.50]  so we could we could try and we could try and offset your you know extra streaming cost or
[466.50 --> 471.64]  whatever try and help try and help a brother out there yeah yeah yeah um so anyway anyway so that's
[471.64 --> 480.80]  that's my cool news okay so it's it's costing um 30 percent more than our one gig switched fiber
[480.80 --> 486.22]  connection which was already really expensive but now the new price that doesn't actually sound that
[486.22 --> 493.56]  it's not that bad yeah plus over the three years we owe them one video which is fine because like
[493.56 --> 498.02]  who cares sounds like they're probably gonna end up getting one anyway and uh and honestly they would
[498.02 --> 502.32]  have probably gotten hopefully they're not watching uh they probably would have gotten one anyway
[502.32 --> 507.46]  because the whole bonded internet thing that we did that was like a commercial product that they had
[507.46 --> 512.70]  before um they have they they acquired the company that did the software for the bonding
[512.70 --> 518.40]  um rewrote it so it's multi-threaded now so you don't need such an expensive appliance to do it
[518.40 --> 522.56]  and they want to oh i wonder if this is confidential well whatever they're gonna have
[522.56 --> 527.92]  they're gonna have better products and services oh crap i hope i just didn't get in a lot of trouble
[527.92 --> 533.04]  uh well whatever they're cool guys uh why don't we just say that and with cool stuff so we probably
[533.04 --> 536.68]  made a video anyway um uh we got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[536.68 --> 544.00]  uh rtx yeah everybody talked about it we haven't yet really ninth gen intel chips
[544.00 --> 551.62]  yeah this is cool steam compatibility tools so you can play more games on on linux
[551.62 --> 556.78]  and uh 10 series gtx cards are on sale also this intro you can watch it now
[556.78 --> 580.44]  you know how much would people pay to see that like linus versus austin cage fight oh my god
[580.44 --> 586.38]  dude austin's great and like works out a lot i think you know how to fight
[586.38 --> 594.40]  oh i mean i'm so interested right now the difference but austin's such a nice person i don't i don't i
[594.40 --> 601.74]  don't think he'd want to do it he's actually just so nice he's like a really good guy i don't know
[601.76 --> 608.38]  i'm so interested though because he's ridiculously fit and works out all the time he's super fit um
[608.38 --> 612.74]  but i don't i don't think he's like actually trained for fighting though yeah but and you are
[612.74 --> 617.98]  that would be a pretty distinct advantage it would like i actually at our weight class i really don't
[617.98 --> 624.04]  think him being more fit is gonna be very helpful but it's an interesting thank you uh it's still an
[624.04 --> 633.66]  interesting comparison if you know what i mean um yeah i guess so oh a benchmark okay yeah yeah yeah
[633.66 --> 639.96]  pretty much just to be clear guys no linus and austin are not boxing
[639.96 --> 649.44]  that that will that is not a thing we're doing uh although if he was down i'd like not like not
[649.44 --> 656.06]  like fucking mma no whoops we don't swear on the way not like mma like freaking bare knuckle or
[656.06 --> 660.44]  anything like that but like but the boxing boxing could be interesting especially because i've never
[660.44 --> 667.22]  boxed before okay so but like i know how to you know pretty much most of the basics i know how to
[667.22 --> 671.32]  punch i know how to dodge i know how to block like i could probably put two and two together
[671.32 --> 677.44]  especially against another amateur but uh tell you what tell you what if austin's down i'll box austin
[677.44 --> 683.52]  there you go god i can't even believe that just happened uh so for the context that people are
[683.52 --> 687.74]  wondering logan paul and ksr fighting tomorrow i think i think it's tomorrow is that real
[687.74 --> 694.60]  what really that's like a thing yeah oh it's ridiculous yeah oh i've been training for a while
[694.60 --> 702.40]  some some external dude did a video on uh how hard they're punching so i watched that because it
[702.40 --> 709.08]  wouldn't give either of them views um and i'll tell you this ksi has way better form and clearly
[709.08 --> 713.76]  knows what he's doing a lot better than logan but then logan is a mountain so we'll see
[713.76 --> 720.66]  logan has much longer reach is this actually like a pay-per-view thing or is this just like
[720.66 --> 727.58]  review on youtube yeah yeah it's kind of interesting though people are gonna hate watch it
[727.58 --> 732.56]  the like people are gonna watch the crap out of that so that they see each of them or one of them
[732.56 --> 736.92]  individually get hit in the face that's like absolutely that is the entire show see that's
[736.92 --> 743.34]  what i think i think your if oh my goodness i don't think that's gonna be a thing um but if you
[743.34 --> 748.60]  and austin are a thing no that's not gonna be a thing yeah i don't think there's no way and i'm i
[748.60 --> 753.50]  am joking but it does it wouldn't have the allure of the like the hate fight no it would be a friendly
[753.50 --> 758.30]  yeah it would be clearly a friendly bout and i can't think i'm sure there's some but i can't think
[758.30 --> 763.16]  of anyone who actively wants to see you guys hitting the face i don't think i could punch austin
[763.16 --> 769.34]  he's too nice like really i would not want to you know i've actually i've actually uh i shouldn't
[769.34 --> 775.80]  say it would never it's complicated but i don't really i don't really count the only time that
[775.80 --> 782.94]  i've ever fought with someone like i i've never really been in a fight no no i i'm i'm of i'm a
[782.94 --> 788.86]  pretty i'm a pretty passive like turn the other cheek kind of most real ones don't last very long
[788.86 --> 795.62]  right when you don't have gloves and like a helmet thingy i guess that's true they like really
[795.62 --> 801.44]  someone gets hit a couple times and they're like wow this isn't nice they usually want to stop you
[801.44 --> 807.68]  know what's really crazy um the the guy so we have a video coming soon uh once again i hope i'm not
[807.68 --> 812.68]  revealing too much wow my hair is just like spectacularly bad good no good yeah you know
[812.68 --> 819.66]  what we're just we're gonna embrace it yeah i'm just gonna have like gamer hair today um so we have
[819.66 --> 825.32]  a sponsored video coming up on deep spar have you ever heard of deep spar uh yeah but i don't know
[825.32 --> 830.62]  a ton about it but i've heard of it so deep spar is a data recovery company that is not like you send
[830.62 --> 835.78]  your hard drive there and they recover your data they actually build tools for data recovery companies
[835.78 --> 840.24]  um anyway so they sponsored a video we're gonna have that coming out pretty soon it's on floatplane
[840.24 --> 850.88]  already and um the guy the the the son of the ceo who also acts as like kind of an operations manager
[850.88 --> 855.36]  like he's an executive there okay we're going to lunch and i'm like so like what are your hobbies
[855.36 --> 865.86]  and he's like oh like uh bare knuckle mma fighting and i'm like really okay and he's like oh yeah love
[865.86 --> 871.62]  it and i'm like so basically you're in fight club and he's like pretty much and he starts to like
[871.62 --> 878.06]  pull back some of his clothes and he starts showing me like some of the bruises that are on him like
[878.06 --> 882.46]  right now meanwhile the guy is like dressed in business casual because he's like at work
[882.46 --> 888.30]  and i'm just i'm looking at this going like i don't think i'm gonna put a toe out of line and i
[888.30 --> 893.34]  think we better deliver a really good video for these guys he's like explaining to me how he has
[893.34 --> 897.98]  no feeling left in his shins yeah no that well that's a goal you want that yeah yeah yeah yeah
[897.98 --> 902.68]  he's like yeah like here here like i just like i don't even feel anything he starts like hitting it
[902.68 --> 906.78]  i'm like stop yeah it's fine i believe he did that on purpose to get to that point right
[906.78 --> 913.48]  micro fractures and stuff kind of ridiculous yeah so so that that's a thing that's not me
[913.48 --> 922.14]  i don't have that killer instinct unfortunately my left hip your left hip yeah same situation really
[922.14 --> 927.08]  yeah because in in football and rugby basically my right side was always my more accurate and
[927.08 --> 932.58]  stronger side uh-huh so whenever i would hit people i would lead on left okay every single time i would
[932.58 --> 936.82]  hit someone i would throw a little bit more to my left it wasn't really supposed to but my whole
[936.82 --> 942.98]  idea was like if it gets a little hurt i can stay in because everything that matters is on my right
[942.98 --> 950.96]  side um so yeah my left hip is like mostly numb i don't really feel anything there huh okay random yeah
[950.96 --> 956.90]  so if i ever actually did have to fight you for some reason go for the right probably yeah generally
[956.90 --> 963.20]  with like everything my right side is just generally less and then die someone someone
[963.20 --> 968.98]  laughed rugby in canada yeah it was uh it was definitely the worst team i was on i'll give you
[968.98 --> 978.02]  that much we were not good i i don't necessarily particularly remember ever winning but we might
[978.02 --> 985.58]  have to do it there was a pretty good rugby rugby program at my high school actually my high school
[985.58 --> 990.88]  no it was the only thing we had there was so yeah there okay so i have heard of schools that are like
[990.88 --> 996.32]  that yeah um and there was like one or two schools that we went against that were pretty good but it was
[996.32 --> 1003.92]  not like a it was not super common right and our school was definitely not good cool at all
[1003.92 --> 1011.90]  um all right so why don't we jump right into intel ninth gen chips on pre-order for pre-order on a
[1011.90 --> 1017.82]  dutch site so this was originally posted by tweakers.net it was posted uh our original articles from
[1017.82 --> 1024.46]  tweakers.net and it was posted by robbie on the forum and if uh if if the rumors are going the way they
[1024.46 --> 1028.96]  have been so far it will be set on stage that they're not true and then immediately after said
[1028.96 --> 1035.26]  after they said that they'll be 100 accurate yeah exactly um you know also there's not a whole lot
[1035.26 --> 1042.92]  of useful information here i mean the top the top chip the 9900k is listed 833 euros i really don't
[1042.92 --> 1050.66]  think that's very likely i wouldn't be surprised if we saw a slight price hike over the 8700k but i
[1050.66 --> 1056.10]  don't i don't see it going even if it is in that euro range the products are usually more expensive
[1056.10 --> 1062.76]  in euros anyways um the more interesting part of the rumors is that it seems to be a confirmation
[1062.76 --> 1070.38]  that we're going to see intel's core i3 i5 i7 thing is about to get even more confusing because we're
[1070.38 --> 1076.32]  going to have a core i7 that doesn't have hyper threading oh boy yeah so it looks like three models
[1076.32 --> 1084.34]  uh 9600k so that's a six core six thread we're going to have a 9700k that's a core i7
[1084.34 --> 1091.24]  so that's eight cores eight threads and then we're going to have a core i oh no it will be an i9
[1091.24 --> 1097.46]  oh my goodness okay and then we're going to have a core i9 on the mainstream platform that is eight
[1097.46 --> 1104.48]  thread eight core 16 threads what are they doing why are they making this did i miss something what's
[1104.48 --> 1110.96]  up with the plus too so plus means with optane support oh i've actually been meaning to do a video
[1110.96 --> 1119.10]  about that like wtf is core i7 plus yeah it basically it's a core i7 and also you put optane
[1119.10 --> 1125.94]  in your computer okay yeah no that's like that's that's silly i mean i'm going to put on the plus
[1125.94 --> 1131.54]  i understand what they're doing because you can't really differentiate on cpu performance anymore
[1131.54 --> 1136.12]  so you might as well differentiate on the overall benefits of your platform what's the i don't know
[1136.12 --> 1139.34]  why i'm drawing a blank on this because i think it's super cool and talk about it relatively often
[1139.34 --> 1145.50]  but the the like uh gpu compute thing that people use for video encoding or the cpu compute yeah
[1145.50 --> 1150.76]  quick sync that if it was plus and that meant quick sync yeah that would honestly make more sense to me
[1150.76 --> 1155.30]  yeah but then that would be bad for them yeah because then you'd have core i9 plus on the mainstream
[1155.30 --> 1161.64]  platform and no core i9 plus on the other one um speaking of intel and their gpus we actually
[1161.64 --> 1166.40]  screwed something up when we did our larabee video actually no i'm not going to move on to that yet
[1166.40 --> 1175.24]  because i wanted to talk about uh core i3 versus i5 versus i7 are we just skipping this intel well
[1175.24 --> 1179.48]  people keep complaining that we haven't talked about it so naturally my initial reaction to that
[1179.48 --> 1188.30]  is to troll them by purposely avoiding it yeah yeah um this this is why intel you shouldn't make this
[1188.30 --> 1196.64]  branding any more confusing 9.5 this is the second most watched video that linus media group has ever
[1196.64 --> 1206.80]  made what the heck is core i3 i5 or i7 at 9.5 million views melting screen prank isn't there i just
[1206.80 --> 1213.50]  want to know i checked i checked the other day you're not there it's close melting screen prank is number
[1213.50 --> 1219.10]  three i think oh my goodness yeah why does it keep going up uh it's still doing really well i think
[1219.10 --> 1226.20]  every time i check it it's up like a million views um core i and core i9 isn't generating any less
[1226.20 --> 1231.48]  confusion because that was four years ago with nine and a half million views and this is a year and a
[1231.48 --> 1238.96]  year ago with two million views and remember that core i9 is such a a one percenter product anyway
[1238.96 --> 1245.42]  yeah that literally all of them watched it not even just that a huge amount of people watched it
[1245.42 --> 1251.20]  because they were like what what should i care i bet as many people watch this video as have bought
[1251.20 --> 1258.62]  core i9's total ever that's pretty funny and that's a problem when you have to do that much education
[1258.62 --> 1265.08]  for you with your consumers um sorry what what was that what was i going to talk about before
[1265.08 --> 1269.32]  i don't remember it seemed important we're dodging rtx seemed important no there was there was another
[1269.32 --> 1274.42]  thing that i was that oh we were talking about how uh it some of them don't have hyper threading when
[1274.42 --> 1279.28]  it seems like they should oh yeah the plus thing is super weird so we have to make another video
[1279.28 --> 1285.66]  thing is dumb oh you were gonna make a video about uh the plus oh yeah yeah that that's basically it we
[1285.66 --> 1291.10]  just wanted to do a video kind of like sharding on it because we think it's pretty dumb yeah um like we
[1291.10 --> 1297.42]  don't think optane is dumb i i actually we've done sponsored stuff for optane this isn't it optane
[1297.42 --> 1306.98]  tech is cool yeah definitely cool um oh wow you know what just occurred to me with that pipe in here
[1306.98 --> 1314.32]  we could also experiment with server configs that we can't necessarily buy or rent at existing data
[1314.32 --> 1318.84]  centers like we could build something totally custom throw it in and see what happens what do you mean
[1318.84 --> 1323.90]  like if we wanted to experiment with something like oh for flow plane yeah yeah definitely that
[1323.90 --> 1330.38]  would be cool yeah okay anyway sorry just think aj's would geek the freaking hell out over that i think
[1330.38 --> 1336.38]  i think so too because uh i've actually got a project upcoming six workstations one cpu i was streaming
[1336.38 --> 1343.32]  about that today yeah and um i might be able to get a hookup on some optane drives for that and then
[1343.32 --> 1347.90]  once that's done i could rip them out we could throw them in a server and just would you want to see what
[1347.90 --> 1354.34]  happens ltt videos about that yeah yeah i think so potentially sure it seems interesting yeah i
[1354.34 --> 1359.02]  don't see why not i would be interested and like i don't necessarily care if people know what like
[1359.02 --> 1365.02]  what our experimental server yeah in the lmg office is whatever i don't think it matters
[1365.02 --> 1369.54]  oh no you can see the videos you're paying to see oh good heavens yeah
[1369.54 --> 1376.86]  all right what else what else we got today um actually this is a really big topic so why don't
[1376.86 --> 1381.92]  we do the nvidia thing first i guess sure uh so this was posted by rat and man on the forum we will
[1381.92 --> 1387.98]  finally acknowledge it uh the original sources i don't know everywhere everyone's talking about it
[1387.98 --> 1397.84]  um d force rtx yeah nvidia has new cards um they're sold out everywhere the brand did you know that
[1397.84 --> 1403.18]  they're legit sold out everywhere really you can't buy them anymore they're all out a bunch of people
[1403.18 --> 1408.30]  were like oh oh like you can solve the the availability problems by like cranking the price
[1408.30 --> 1414.22]  hey nvidia you thought about that and then boom sold out almost immediately there's people like angry
[1414.22 --> 1418.56]  that they can't buy them like it's really yeah yeah but they don't even know what the performance
[1418.56 --> 1424.28]  is yet no one seems to care it's a great world isn't it really there's like there's less performance
[1424.28 --> 1429.40]  metrics than there was on the pascal launch there's basically none even the pascal launch like they had
[1429.40 --> 1435.42]  more direct performance metrics they were like it compares this weird abstracted number better in this
[1435.42 --> 1442.48]  game uh but like smp based and that was the weirdness with every generation nvidia's hubris grows
[1442.48 --> 1447.56]  but the thing about hubris is that it's supposed to like cause some kind of downfall and i don't
[1447.56 --> 1451.88]  foresee that as long as people keep giving them money for stuff that's completely sight unseen nowhere
[1451.88 --> 1458.56]  and like i think i think the the prediction from last when even if it doesn't end up being completely
[1458.56 --> 1463.32]  true yeah is going to be more true than is kind of comfortable because i really don't think there's
[1463.32 --> 1467.90]  going to be a huge performance increase i think it's a feature thing yeah that's what it looks like
[1467.90 --> 1474.26]  because ray tracing does seem super cool it's going to be faster gddr6 is faster and i'm sure
[1474.26 --> 1478.90]  they haven't been completely sitting on ass for the last two years so obviously it's going to be
[1479.48 --> 1486.80]  a bit faster but i don't think the fps increases are the story here is the story here um here's the
[1486.80 --> 1491.06]  thing that makes me uncomfortable a lot of the ray tracing demos that we've seen so far running at like
[1491.06 --> 1499.56]  45 frames per second for one of them um and i'm kind of looking at it going ah 30 to 45 to be clear
[1499.56 --> 1509.08]  too 45 was on the high end for tomb raider when was the last time you felt like lighting was the issue
[1509.08 --> 1510.78]  for in-game realism
[1510.78 --> 1521.04]  okay so i will answer this in two different ways one is more direct to the question and one of them is a
[1521.04 --> 1527.58]  basically never for the first one yeah but really really really good applications of lighting have
[1527.58 --> 1534.12]  definitely helped with realism and there is examples of like holy cow with the right lighting that really
[1534.12 --> 1540.96]  helps get you out of the valley the uncanny valley thing is what i'm talking about i can understand
[1540.96 --> 1549.68]  the benefits to it um but it is extremely a like if we're talking about gaming it's extremely a single
[1549.68 --> 1553.42]  player focused thing because if you're playing anything multiplayer you're going to want to turn
[1553.42 --> 1562.68]  that the heck off yeah because for me like i i i have always been far more i've always found poor facial
[1562.68 --> 1570.72]  animations um yeah or definitely low resolution textures or just poorly done graphics in general
[1570.72 --> 1577.32]  yeah or just uh lazy or sloppy uh set deck is what we call it in production i don't know what they call
[1577.32 --> 1582.88]  it in gaming but just like the the the clutter in a room when you walk into it like seeing that same
[1582.88 --> 1591.68]  clock model reused a lot like that kind of stuff is far more jarring to me than the bounces of the
[1591.68 --> 1598.86]  light rays as they move around a scene someone someone in uh chat said lol lighting ray tracing isn't just
[1598.86 --> 1603.58]  about well it's x47 i'll give you a call it isn't just about lighting for games the most important
[1603.58 --> 1608.66]  thing will be reflections that can show objects that are behind a perspective camera wow that's niche
[1608.66 --> 1614.34]  um he didn't have the wow that's niche part i threw that in there his little flavor text
[1614.34 --> 1617.98]  also reflections or lighting uh yeah
[1617.98 --> 1628.54]  right there bud so yeah uh i okay i think the tech is actually really cool and i was talking to
[1628.54 --> 1635.82]  um i had a buddy over here who he i told you about him i met him in sweden he gave me the tour of the
[1635.82 --> 1641.56]  particle accelerator labs and the laser labs and stuff he's really excited about it from like scientific
[1641.56 --> 1649.24]  applications yes because those cores are going to be super helpful yes and like he's stoked um also
[1649.24 --> 1654.52]  they might actually be willing to do videos at that place now that would be amazing yeah okay we'll take
[1654.52 --> 1660.20]  that offline yeah okay um and it's still very unsure and stuff but i'll get you more info later sure uh but
[1660.20 --> 1664.28]  like he's really stoked and that's really cool and that lines up with the story that nvidia has been
[1664.28 --> 1668.92]  giving us for quite a few years now which is where like ai stuff is important science is important we're
[1668.92 --> 1673.08]  doing the deep learning yes stuff we're doing blah blah blah they've been trooping for this for a
[1673.08 --> 1682.20]  very long time i wish i owned nvidia stock yeah it it it yeah exactly it makes sense in their in their
[1682.20 --> 1686.84]  path that they've been taking it's all very logical the fact that the performance jump probably isn't
[1686.84 --> 1690.84]  going to be that huge but they have this really cool ray tracing stuff and they have the new cores and
[1690.84 --> 1696.52]  all that kind of stuff that's all very cool basically nvidia has gone from making gaming gpus
[1696.52 --> 1704.20]  that they adapt to workstations and professional uses to making professional gpus and then trickling
[1704.20 --> 1712.28]  the features down to gaming somehow and i think that is reflected in the fact that um the 1080ti is
[1712.28 --> 1720.12]  basically a titan which has been more or less accepted by most people yes so anyway the prices that
[1720.12 --> 1727.48]  these cards have sold out at did i say 1080 yeah yeah i meant 20 yeah so the founders edition 2080 ti is
[1727.48 --> 1735.40]  1200 us the founders edition 2080 is 800 us and the founders edition 2070 is 600 so the best news i think
[1735.40 --> 1743.56]  coming out of all of this given that any time like i've uh so here's the other problem when nvidia launched
[1743.56 --> 1750.36]  the 1080 it was all about this voxel based illumination and stuff like smp that was all
[1750.36 --> 1759.80]  they wanted to talk about are there any games that used it smp something it's multi-projection that
[1759.80 --> 1763.64]  would that was actually the biggest thing that they were pushing was that the big thing yes it was
[1763.64 --> 1770.04]  simultaneous multi-projection and games use that but it was vr the voxel thing yeah so global illumination
[1770.04 --> 1781.00]  i'm pretty sure vxgi that's what they called it yeah voxel global illumination vxgi um the xgi game
[1782.76 --> 1791.80]  so there's a epic games demo from 2015 unreal engine 4.19 nvidia vxgi flowblast so here's my problem
[1792.52 --> 1799.80]  anytime we get a fundamental shift in the way that games are rendered the first generation card that
[1799.80 --> 1806.12]  supports it by the time any games launch any demanding triple a grade games launch that use it
[1807.00 --> 1813.56]  is not going to perform well enough for the way it's meant to be played experience that's my problem
[1813.56 --> 1819.32]  every time we get a card that is sold based on a feature whether that feature is tessellation or
[1819.32 --> 1825.96]  whether it's direct x12 or whether it's vxgi you go back again and again and again and again and
[1825.96 --> 1830.52]  there's a selling feature and then that's when you have hardware so game developers can actually
[1830.52 --> 1835.08]  start working on the bloody thing and then there's the next card or the one after that that actually
[1835.08 --> 1840.52]  does it well enough that you can get a great gaming experience with it that's my concern about ray
[1840.52 --> 1845.80]  tracing with these new cards is that yes they will support it but when we actually get games that do
[1845.80 --> 1850.36]  a fantastic job once the game developers fully understand this technology and know how to use it
[1850.36 --> 1857.72]  it it's probably not going to be able to keep up but i could be wrong and i mean frankly for me if we
[1857.72 --> 1862.04]  don't see any improvement in anything other than lighting if ray tracing is the only thing that
[1862.52 --> 1867.72]  that the game engine makers work on over the next couple of years and they they find a way to make me
[1867.72 --> 1872.20]  totally wrong because the games will basically run the same way that they run now except we'll be
[1872.20 --> 1880.84]  fully utilizing this ray tracing additional hardware yeah then then great um but i don't know i don't
[1880.84 --> 1887.80]  know if i've yet seen something that has broken that pattern can you think yeah well okay to again
[1887.80 --> 1893.24]  it's first card that supported physics by the time anything really implemented physics properly did it run
[1893.24 --> 1901.96]  well no i do fully believe the bigger push for pascal was smp um and looking up smp game is going to be
[1901.96 --> 1907.72]  confusing because smp is a like a vr thing and it's like a suite of things as well and you can use it
[1907.72 --> 1913.08]  in different ways so there's games that weren't really vr based that used parts of it to right do
[1913.08 --> 1922.68]  things uh but really there wasn't a ton of titles that utilized smp right as far as i know okay you're
[1922.68 --> 1927.00]  taking short term that is exactly what we're doing that is exactly what we're doing when you spend your
[1927.00 --> 1931.88]  money you're actually buying a thing to actually use especially when you're buying like emerging
[1931.88 --> 1938.36]  technologies yeah and like here's here's the thing is that it's kind of funny because it's one of
[1938.36 --> 1947.24]  those situations where the more affluent you are almost the more um likely you are when the next one
[1947.24 --> 1952.60]  comes out that can actually run it well the more likely you are to just be able to buy that too so if
[1952.60 --> 1959.48]  you can afford a 2080 ti now then you could probably afford to just run your 1080 ti that you probably have
[1960.28 --> 1965.24]  until a 3080 ti comes out that'll actually run like by the time some games come out that can actually
[1965.24 --> 1970.36]  utilize it you could probably just buy that that's my point it's almost like the more money you have
[1970.36 --> 1975.80]  the less it makes sense to waste it whereas if you were someone who had to scrimp and save in order to
[1975.80 --> 1980.52]  get a 2080 ti well then you're probably getting a big upgrade because you're probably running something
[1980.52 --> 1985.16]  that's a lot slower so you're probably also getting additional performance you're on like six or 700 series
[1985.16 --> 1989.32]  i guess that's that's kind of the point like if you're someone who upgrades every three or four
[1989.32 --> 1994.44]  years by all means go out and buy a 2000 series have fun because you're gonna be getting a great
[1994.44 --> 1999.96]  upgrade across the board it's just until i see it i'm gonna have a hard time believing that based on
[1999.96 --> 2006.92]  this feature this upgrade makes a ton of sense for someone that has a modern card unless again uh
[2006.92 --> 2011.88]  i've been wrong before buddy we don't have performance benchmarks yet yeah i don't have a card yeah
[2011.88 --> 2019.00]  so i'm just talking out of my butt yeah who knows the the fact that everyone pre-ordered this already
[2019.00 --> 2027.56]  is freaking insane yeah and every generation of cards nvidia just kind of takes even more control
[2027.56 --> 2032.52]  over the the the messaging like they've they've announced the cards they've put them on sale
[2033.32 --> 2039.16]  and we still the the independent media knows absolutely nothing other than what we've had
[2039.16 --> 2042.28]  leaked by nvidia's partners or what they said on a stage
[2044.68 --> 2050.76]  yeah dang yeah and like obviously and i'm sure some people are thinking this no one's really said
[2050.76 --> 2056.04]  it but i'm sure some people are thinking of this uh there is benefit to us to say wait for performance
[2056.04 --> 2060.12]  benchmarks yeah sure sure of course yeah but there's also a huge benefit to you
[2060.12 --> 2067.72]  yeah so like just throwing that out we're both benefiting here this is this is great for both
[2067.72 --> 2074.04]  no no fake news fake news media and not even just us you should like watch our video when it comes out
[2074.04 --> 2078.76]  check out our performance benchmarks and then look at like a lot of other people's yeah yeah go check
[2078.76 --> 2084.36]  out go check out shroud go check out an untac i'm sure ryan will do some stuff like by all means like
[2084.36 --> 2089.80]  it's like doing a little mix of like the video people and the written people that's good um aiden games
[2089.80 --> 2098.84]  1250 thank you very much for the reminder ad and games 1250 says sponsors oh don't forget your
[2098.84 --> 2105.32]  sponsors thanks thank you uh why don't we start with a relatively new sponsor they're sort of new
[2105.32 --> 2108.44]  they're new in the sense that they're new right now we haven't worked with them in a while shade
[2108.44 --> 2114.20]  tree sunglasses are handmade from premium wood materials this is the hazelnut helpfully labeled by
[2114.20 --> 2121.96]  johnno oh nice yeah i know right this is the ponderosa rosa ponderosa so this is i saw these on the
[2121.96 --> 2127.72]  shelf i thought it was tea no these are sunglasses so they're handmade from premium wood materials they
[2127.72 --> 2132.28]  use a polarized lens that blocks 100 of the uv rays from the sun they've got two new styles that
[2132.92 --> 2140.36]  even smells like wood i mean i guess shut up uh anyway uh the two new styles called ponderosa and hazelnut
[2140.36 --> 2150.12]  those are dark i can barely see these are very good um uh this one ponderosa is made from a black
[2150.12 --> 2155.88]  walnut with titanium hinges and the hazelnut is made from solid ebony wood and sized for people with
[2155.88 --> 2163.56]  smaller faces that's your problem this one was for me it actually fits a lot better all right uh so
[2163.56 --> 2169.56]  grab yourself a pair today and use offer code linus to get 10 off through the link below oh polarized lenses
[2169.56 --> 2175.32]  that's right i was like wow these are so dark i can barely see that yeah yeah but uh so if you
[2175.32 --> 2179.48]  were wondering why we're doing this yeah if you if you look at it like straight on it's basically black
[2179.48 --> 2184.84]  yeah if there was any doubt that the polarization was working yeah let me put that to rest it's very
[2184.84 --> 2190.76]  clearly working it's very very working interesting so this monitor is polarized the other way yeah
[2190.76 --> 2196.12]  compared to my laptop oh and yours too and mine how very interesting uh we also have a couple other
[2196.12 --> 2207.24]  sponsors today first up is madrina's coffee oh madrina's coffee is coffee for fuel big cans of
[2207.24 --> 2212.28]  cold brew coffee with a flavor for everyone from sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or caramel to
[2212.28 --> 2218.04]  bold and roasty flavors like cold brew black and dark roast they are delicious specialty grade blends of
[2218.04 --> 2224.04]  cold brew coffee that is very redundant thank you colton and guys and they come in a convenient
[2224.04 --> 2229.96]  ready to drink 16 ounce can from now until august 31st you can get 50 off your madrina's coffee order
[2229.96 --> 2236.04]  with discount code linus all caps the first 50 people to use the code will also get a free bag of
[2236.04 --> 2243.00]  micro roast automatically added to their order what so go to madrina's coffee dot com slash linus which i
[2243.00 --> 2248.76]  will put up there now haha to get 50 off that's crazy for those of you who drink hot coffee by the way
[2248.76 --> 2253.56]  they just launched three new micro roasts two dragons side quest and double diamond and they're now
[2253.56 --> 2258.20]  available on their website i'm just gonna put that there these are sweet oh by the way there uh slow
[2258.20 --> 2263.72]  mo is in the chat if you have any questions about madrina's yeah finally always helpful savage jerky
[2263.72 --> 2272.52]  i have never tried their hot sauce holy crap this is a reaper hot sauce i was just gonna say
[2272.52 --> 2282.52]  is now actually the time how many reapers would it take to make a jar of a bottle of hot sauce
[2282.52 --> 2290.84]  this big how terrifying is that yeah it's pretty terrifying are you gonna do it ingredients
[2290.84 --> 2302.12]  tomatoes carolina reaper peppers it's the second one habanero peppers apple cider vinegar honey lime
[2302.12 --> 2308.76]  juice garlic onions kosher salt light brown sugar and ground mustard that actually sounds delicious
[2308.76 --> 2313.24]  that does sound delicious it also sounds like carolina reapers it's a second ingredient it also sounds
[2314.12 --> 2321.64]  savage yeah yeah savage jerky oh boy made from the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives
[2321.64 --> 2327.32]  with the goal of creating a snack that is full of flavor and spice but that isn't bad for you he's
[2327.32 --> 2332.12]  taking the safety they've got 13 different flavors of jerky like the sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon
[2332.12 --> 2337.96]  maple buffalo bacon is my personal favorite they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub
[2339.56 --> 2345.64]  one of their hot sauces is made from carolina reaper peppers one of the hottest peppers in the world
[2345.64 --> 2355.40]  and you can use offer code ltt to save 10 on all their products i i'm just gonna try a little bit
[2355.40 --> 2358.68]  because i i you want a little bit if you're going i'm going all right
[2358.68 --> 2370.92]  i think i think i think why would you move right then there's there's hot sauce all over my laptop
[2370.92 --> 2379.48]  oh man that's a lot i'm gonna die well hold on how much do you have oh i wasn't looking i'm pretty
[2379.48 --> 2384.92]  sure that's more what happened i don't actually think no no i was looking when i was pouring the other
[2384.92 --> 2394.04]  one where's the lid did that get on you yeah it's all over my pants oh hot pants that's spicy i'm
[2394.04 --> 2399.80]  wearing hot pants yeah yeah yeah those are things whoa what just happened oh did someone just turn off
[2399.80 --> 2408.60]  all the filming lights that's only one of them thank you i think they're working on it okay okay who
[2408.60 --> 2413.48]  has more do we have the same amount that's pretty similar i might have slightly less but my finger is
[2413.48 --> 2420.92]  bigger okay you've got some wrapped around be aware of that okay all right uh yeah i think we're good ed okay
[2422.76 --> 2425.80]  i actually really don't want to do this okay
[2429.72 --> 2431.16]  oh i can already feel wow
[2435.88 --> 2436.28]  oh
[2443.48 --> 2448.84]  ed could i get a paper towel
[2450.60 --> 2452.36]  i spilled hot sauce on my laptop
[2454.20 --> 2455.56]  i need something to wipe it off with
[2461.80 --> 2466.60]  anyways uh if you want if you want a huge variety of great beef jerky
[2467.24 --> 2469.32]  i'm crying so much right now
[2469.32 --> 2470.04]  oh
[2472.28 --> 2472.76]  thank you
[2476.20 --> 2481.80]  my eyes are fine i'll try to prove that oh no i i got them tears you're crying a little bit yeah
[2482.36 --> 2487.88]  but i uh so my oh my chest has already not felt very good today i'm man enough to cry
[2488.44 --> 2491.80]  i can i can feel it oh maybe this will clear me up you know
[2491.80 --> 2500.12]  oh oh once you get like if i wasn't just drinking it um
[2501.64 --> 2508.04]  like i i actually i love hot sauce on my like marinara pasta yeah yeah yeah yeah like putting that
[2508.04 --> 2514.20]  in like a pasta or something that's really nice the flavors are really good it's got some lime to it
[2514.20 --> 2520.28]  like it's that is actually a really delicious hot sauce got a nice acidity i wouldn't recommend just
[2520.28 --> 2526.92]  drinking it yeah nice okay well there you go i'm actually i'm gonna take that home one thing i
[2526.92 --> 2532.60]  noticed about that was the immediacy of it oh some of them there's like a bit of a delay so that
[2532.60 --> 2541.56]  hits you right away oh okay straight to the vein all right all right uh anyway do we have any more like
[2541.56 --> 2549.24]  tech news topics we wanted to talk about here uh okay there's wow oh yeah steam compatibility tool
[2549.24 --> 2553.88]  yeah oh do you want to do the clash of electric car first that's amazing but we want to do that no
[2553.88 --> 2562.20]  let's do it first let's do it first okay so kalashnikov yes that kalashnikov i always thought
[2562.20 --> 2566.76]  it was kalashnikov but it's like it's not it's like clearly not spelled that way so did i um
[2566.76 --> 2575.64]  it actually looks really cool it actually looks really cool i really like the style kind of like
[2576.44 --> 2583.96]  like hipstery like like modern but with classic inspiration yeah like i'm not really a car guy
[2583.96 --> 2589.96]  like it's clearly old school but then the the rims and the lights and the grill like that would turn
[2589.96 --> 2596.76]  my head yeah on the street oh yeah yeah yeah it looks great for sure it's got style most cool modern
[2596.76 --> 2603.72]  cars yeah it's hard to see them ever being classic yep whereas this has a really iconic looking design
[2603.72 --> 2610.12]  it's it's really different really different from anything else so russian weapons manufacturer
[2610.12 --> 2616.52]  kalashnikov best known for making the ak-47 has unveiled a fleet of electric and hybrid cars
[2616.52 --> 2624.12]  buggies and motorcycles these guys went all out i guess them falling uh weapons uh rifle sales in
[2624.12 --> 2630.36]  the u.s might be prompting this you know about that right no i didn't yeah so it's interesting for the gun
[2630.36 --> 2639.64]  companies um democratic leadership has actually been better for their sales because people run out
[2639.64 --> 2645.80]  no that makes sense buy a bunch of guns wow just in case so they'll get grandfathered in in case a bunch
[2645.80 --> 2655.16]  of anti-gun protection yep um anyway so this includes an electric vehicle that the company claims will
[2655.16 --> 2660.92]  rival tesla well when tesla makes all their stuff open source it kind of makes sense it's a concept car
[2660.92 --> 2668.12]  dubbed the cv1 and bears a close resemblance to the soviet era trabant see i'm not actually like i'm not a car
[2668.12 --> 2673.24]  guy so i'm not that let's have let's have a look at that i don't know how to pronounce it but i've
[2673.24 --> 2681.00]  seen it before for sure i watched a mini documentary on it okay yeah it does kind of there's clearly a
[2681.00 --> 2688.52]  lot of different faulty towers wait what hold on a second is this the car that what is this from
[2689.48 --> 2694.68]  i thought he drove a british car no it can't be there's no way he's driving like a soviet car that
[2694.68 --> 2700.28]  can't be right anyway um it just it looks like the parking lot of the faulty towers hotel on the show
[2702.20 --> 2708.36]  it's not is it anyway whatever so that's the car it's based on looks really cool um
[2709.80 --> 2715.56]  let's have a look here so the cv1 is based on the trabant was an east german car
[2716.20 --> 2722.52]  okay east german car okay starch plastic there you go uh so it's based on the retro izh
[2722.52 --> 2731.64]  22 21 252 and that's known as the combi and it's a test bed for kalashnikov's electric drive train
[2732.28 --> 2738.12]  um so the company said they developed it in-house it's got a cruising range of 350 clicks zero to 100
[2738.12 --> 2745.32]  kilometers so zero to 60 for our american friends in roughly six seconds and 90 kilowatt hours our battery
[2745.32 --> 2751.00]  capacity of 90 kilowatts per hour i think that means 90 kilowatt hours i think that's just a typo in our notes
[2751.00 --> 2760.12]  yeah would you buy a kalashnikov car okay so with what i know about their most famous rifle not
[2760.12 --> 2765.72]  necessarily their other productions but the most famous rifle yeah because the idea is that it just
[2765.72 --> 2771.72]  always works so it does that i don't know if that goes into their other forms of engineering in a lot of
[2771.72 --> 2777.56]  ways electric vehicles are less complex than an internal combustion engine even though they're actually
[2777.56 --> 2782.44]  it's funny i was about to say they're newer tech they're not um electric cars actually came first
[2782.44 --> 2787.96]  if you go back far enough they're really old but um the the modern electric cars are definitely newer
[2787.96 --> 2792.84]  tech than the very refined internal combustion engines that we have today but in a lot of ways
[2792.84 --> 2798.68]  they're a lot simpler so it shouldn't be that big of a surprise that we're seeing like almost a
[2798.68 --> 2807.56]  like a land grab like gold rush style um i don't know what would you call it like a renaissance like
[2807.56 --> 2812.04]  a yeah well like you're seeing a lot of brands pop out of the woodwork with electric cars electric
[2812.04 --> 2817.00]  motorcycles just complete nobody's mostly most of the traditional car companies are stepping in as well
[2817.00 --> 2822.92]  but there is a lot of random new companies stepping up and making electric cars yeah i mean even that bike
[2822.92 --> 2829.08]  that i want to go down and test drive which i will be doing i have a trip to san fran confirmed so i
[2829.08 --> 2836.36]  will be doing that did i talk about that on my show last week igor kozy rev says bs bs fully spelt out
[2836.36 --> 2844.36]  you naive canadians don't understand anything in russia is proposed for corruption not for making final product
[2844.36 --> 2856.12]  it sounds a little aggressive so nothing in russia will be produced i'm also starting to question his
[2856.12 --> 2862.20]  username because he's like it sounds like he's trashing russia but he's sounds like he has a super
[2862.20 --> 2866.92]  russian username so he might actually be like playing that angle says you won't get one yeah i i don't
[2866.92 --> 2871.80]  actually expect kalashnikov to necessarily make a push into the u.s yeah but that doesn't mean that no
[2871.80 --> 2878.52]  one will ever own one we'll see if they make them uh all right this is huge news this week this was
[2878.52 --> 2885.16]  posted by pip nina on the forum and it is the steam compatibility tool so the original article here is
[2885.16 --> 2894.04]  actually steam the steam community boop steam for linux introducing a new version of steam play so it
[2894.04 --> 2900.52]  looks like they have not given up on gaming for linux even though steam os kind of died on the vine
[2900.52 --> 2905.16]  uh they've released a beta which is probably fine of a new and improved version of steam play to all
[2905.16 --> 2911.08]  linux users it includes a modified distribution of wine called proton so wine is wine is not an
[2911.08 --> 2916.28]  emulator it's way to play windows games on steam called proton to provide compatibility with windows
[2916.28 --> 2921.08]  game titles here are some of the improvements it brings to the table windows games with no linux
[2921.08 --> 2925.80]  version currently available can now be installed and run directly from the linux steam client complete
[2925.80 --> 2931.24]  with native steamworks and open vr support wow direct x 11 and 12 implementations are now based
[2931.24 --> 2936.68]  on vulkan resulting in improved game compatibility and reduced performance impact full screen support
[2936.68 --> 2940.92]  has been improved full screen full screen games will be seamlessly stretched to the desired display
[2940.92 --> 2945.16]  without interfering with the native monitor resolution or requiring the use of a virtual desktop
[2945.16 --> 2950.60]  improved game controller support they will automatically recognize all controllers supported by steam that's
[2950.60 --> 2955.72]  very cool and expect more out-of-the-box controller compatibility than even the original version of the game
[2955.80 --> 2960.20]  performance from multi-threaded games has been greatly improved compared to vanilla wine
[2960.76 --> 2966.28]  wow good so the initial set of supported games with the beta release is the second one is the most
[2966.28 --> 2971.88]  important beat saber bejeweled 2 deluxe doki doki literature club doom doom 2 hell on earth doom vfr
[2971.88 --> 2979.48]  fallout shelter fate final fantasy 6 really oh wow i am gonna go get that and play it on linux just for lols
[2980.20 --> 2984.60]  geometry dash google earth vr into the breach magic the gathering a bunch of other magic the gathering
[2984.60 --> 2989.08]  mountain blade mountain blade with fire and sword near payday quake stalker shadow of chernobyl star
[2989.08 --> 2993.32]  wars battlefront 2 tekken 7 the last remnant tropical 4 ultimate doom warhammer 4000 dawn of
[2993.32 --> 2999.40]  war dark crusade some other warhammer thing and users are also able to try playing non-white listed
[2999.40 --> 3004.28]  games using an override switch in the steam client and apparently a ton of stuff is working going forward
[3004.28 --> 3009.48]  users can vote on their favorite games to be considered for steam play using platform wish listing
[3009.48 --> 3016.04]  and presumably they will like work on that wow very cool very very very cool proton contains a
[3016.04 --> 3019.88]  custom version of wine as well as additional libraries developed alongside it is fully open
[3019.88 --> 3026.76]  source and available right now on github this could change everything especially if they keep progressing
[3026.76 --> 3032.04]  especially if they like actually stick with it mind you valve has shown considerable resilience when it
[3032.04 --> 3039.16]  comes to decoupling themselves from microsoft and windows even if the particular projects that they've
[3039.16 --> 3045.40]  worked on have not necessarily developed much like i don't think they've done anything with um steam
[3045.40 --> 3051.40]  link since the original one yeah not that i'm aware of anyway but i think like when you look at steam
[3051.40 --> 3059.80]  link steam controller and the what was steam os steam box kind of deal that situation none of that really was
[3059.80 --> 3067.96]  enough to pull people away i guess um so maybe this will be i definitely know some people i i don't know
[3067.96 --> 3073.48]  anyone who's going to switch to linux because of this uh but i definitely know some people that were
[3073.48 --> 3077.96]  already using linux and already trying to game on linux that are super excited because of it if that makes
[3077.96 --> 3086.84]  sense what's going on this was an actual topic in the doc yeah i had no idea this was a topic yeah who
[3086.84 --> 3095.16]  should linux fight on page i thought we were just like dicking around no the biggest event in internet
[3095.16 --> 3103.00]  history i have focus pads if this becomes a thing we can train oh wow uh i know i know like the basics of
[3103.00 --> 3109.80]  boxing training now because i've started i'm not fighting austin that's no no i don't think you should
[3109.80 --> 3118.44]  fight awesome but if you do fight someone i just think austin's too nice you don't think i'm too nice
[3118.44 --> 3125.24]  wow wow wow dick you don't think i'm too nice to punch someone have you ever seen me look like i was
[3125.24 --> 3136.28]  close to punching someone no but i think you could actually yes i think i have when on the couch at my
[3136.28 --> 3144.52]  parents house what happened there scrapyard wars season four what happened in what was season four
[3145.08 --> 3150.36]  remember okay the power went out that day we had to move the entire operation for the end of season
[3150.36 --> 3155.88]  four scrapyard wars to my parents house because they still had power yeah um and then we had to film
[3155.88 --> 3164.12]  scrapyard wars and a channel superfund there and uh because of we had a room arrangement planned here
[3164.12 --> 3169.16]  and because we couldn't do it here we had to sit in the family room of my parents house while everyone
[3169.16 --> 3173.24]  else was in the garage and they had to film it on their cell phones and hangouts to us
[3174.92 --> 3180.68]  and basically everyone was like doing oh i was mad but i couldn't have punched anyone no one that was
[3180.68 --> 3185.48]  there but i think you could have punched someone i could have punched something but not someone i was
[3185.48 --> 3191.48]  mad enough to punch something but you definitely wouldn't have hit anyone that was there no no no no
[3191.48 --> 3195.72]  those are my friends i would i would never punch a friend like that it couldn't be a thing it's
[3195.72 --> 3199.88]  also like illegal but so i don't think you'd be stupid enough to just hit random people yeah but
[3199.88 --> 3205.88]  if you're in like a ring and it's measured i think you could hit something all right well on that note
[3205.88 --> 3211.80]  my battery is dead on my laptop so uh the wan show's over thanks for watching guys uh see you
[3211.80 --> 3225.80]  again next week same bad time same bat channel bye oh what the crap that wasn't what was planned
[3228.84 --> 3234.76]  data file says i imagine linus and austin fighting like mandark and dexter dexter's lab
[3234.76 --> 3244.12]  where they like kind of slap each other with their gloved hands
