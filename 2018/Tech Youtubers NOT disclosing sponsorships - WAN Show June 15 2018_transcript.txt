[0.00 --> 9.50]  how about now i mean the mic thing is bumping we'll see what people say just waiting on the
[9.50 --> 22.26]  chat to stop pressing f to pay respects waiting on the chat come on yeah yeah thanks twitch chat
[22.26 --> 31.62]  welcome to the show uh linus is here linus too hi guys i'm linus from maple ridge bc i enjoy socks
[31.62 --> 38.90]  sandals and badminton and annual employee reviews and apparently camping uh linus has gone camping
[38.90 --> 44.48]  john's on the show this week uh and we have a great show like every week i don't even know if
[44.48 --> 49.88]  we have enough topics to uh to call out in the intro thingy but we do a bunch of tech youtubers
[49.88 --> 56.08]  were accused of not disclosing computex sponsorships or being paid to go to booths and all this other
[56.08 --> 61.40]  kind of stuff jay from jay's two cents has already released a full video about this i know a lot of
[61.40 --> 65.88]  people have been talking about this on a lot of tech yeah a number of other i'm not sure who else did
[65.88 --> 72.22]  like a full on video besides jay but i know that paul and kyle and i think also some others at least
[72.22 --> 76.56]  addressed it on twitter so yeah gamers nexus was talking about it as well like a lot of people
[76.56 --> 80.22]  talking about it on twitter and then i know jay made a full dedicated video outside of that i'm not
[80.22 --> 85.44]  entirely sure uh but we'll talk about that unsurprisingly everyone in the youtube tech review
[85.44 --> 92.08]  scene is friends so this got slammed down pretty fast with a collective effort of like what the f
[92.08 --> 98.04]  that's bull poop um anyways moving on we'll talk about that more later there's a rumor that an
[98.04 --> 106.12]  eight core version of the 8700k is coming this fall uh people are thinking that they're just kind of
[106.12 --> 110.42]  intel is just kind of reacting to amd because they don't really seem to have a logical roadmap anymore
[110.42 --> 115.78]  but we'll we'll talk about that later also at&t closes the time warner deal is this like straight
[115.78 --> 122.96]  up like for sure z according um so i actually your arms look huge you're a machine i'm sorry he's
[122.96 --> 127.48]  off camera yeah nick is over here off camera flexing for us and trying to distract us from the show with
[127.48 --> 134.10]  his pythons uh but yes um i talked about this on tech link today um okay yes this deal is apparently
[134.10 --> 138.92]  final so wow the judge approved it like two days ago and i think they were just sort of chomping at
[138.92 --> 145.54]  the bit to get it done so wow okay also we've got apple uh is trying to stop developers from sharing
[145.54 --> 154.64]  data on users friends that sounds good probably yeah i don't know um a rumor that the that there's
[154.64 --> 162.12]  an amd radeon rx 680 which like an expected price range of like three to four hundred bucks and a
[162.12 --> 168.00]  rumor that windows 10 is going to run on a google pixel book which is pretty weird but probably a good
[168.00 --> 173.62]  idea and we're going to talk about smash brothers ultimate briefly oh maybe so yeah that's going to
[173.62 --> 178.14]  happen oh yeah that's actually pretty sweet okay there are no good topics today oh interesting
[178.14 --> 184.62]  yeah but then like things that other people care about other than me people care about this
[184.62 --> 192.02]  do you want it that would be pretty cool
[192.02 --> 208.12]  yeah oh right uh sponsors uh moss backpack savage jerky and oh ltx oh we're sponsoring ourselves
[208.12 --> 216.76]  we're sponsoring ourselves it's amazing and set that back and uh here we have so much ill-gotten money
[216.76 --> 220.90]  according to this first topic we'll talk about that we can just sponsor ourselves yeah which i think we're
[220.90 --> 225.42]  going to bring nick on for so the first topic of the day is going to be the tech youtubers accused
[225.42 --> 231.44]  of not getting up okay yeah yeah yeah okay i'll just like stand in the back i'll do a i'll do a slab
[231.44 --> 235.74]  squat in the back yeah but um well you're going to get getting owned by the microphone it's okay i'll
[235.74 --> 240.28]  figure it out yeah tech youtubers accused of not disclosing computex sponsorships so nick had the
[240.28 --> 245.68]  great idea of coming down as our businessman to directly address sure um it's pretty simple
[245.68 --> 254.00]  if we're paid by someone we we tell you that's literally it um yes we visit sponsors booths yes we
[254.00 --> 258.84]  create coverage at sponsors booths um we say that right at the beginning of the video at the end of
[258.84 --> 266.72]  the video um we do not charge an appearance fee to show up at a booth um brands reach out to us they
[266.72 --> 270.36]  say we have interesting stuff and you should check it out and we say okay sure we might check it out
[270.36 --> 277.64]  and sometimes we do and sometimes we don't and that's literally how we do it so if you are concerned
[277.64 --> 281.76]  that the content that you're watching is paid for um just check the beginning of the video and if it
[281.76 --> 286.40]  says this is sponsored by so and so then yes and if it doesn't say that then no and it'll also say
[286.40 --> 292.12]  that in the in the video description so it's literally that simple for for us yeah that's it
[292.12 --> 298.52]  cool short and to the point yeah i'm gonna i don't know it's from from my perspective it's like
[298.52 --> 303.82]  i don't know it's it's literally that simple if we're paid by someone we say it and if we don't
[303.82 --> 309.74]  say it then we're not paid by them to make that content that's it yeah yeah cool and i'll add some
[309.74 --> 316.30]  like more kind of anecdotes but that's that's more or less it um i i think most people in the tech
[316.30 --> 321.52]  review space do sort of the same deal i i can't think of anyone off the top of my head who doesn't
[321.52 --> 328.32]  disclose sponsorships that i've been able to notice but um like if if at a lot of the shows that i've
[328.32 --> 332.34]  done it's changed a little bit since i've been doing a lot of shows but a lot of the shows that
[332.34 --> 339.02]  i've done the majority of the videos that come out of that show are not have nothing to do with the
[339.02 --> 345.62]  sponsorship for that show so like say say corsair because they sponsored a bunch of shows that i did
[345.62 --> 350.48]  in the past say corsair is sponsoring it they were a sponsor at computex so we okay that works we created
[350.48 --> 356.64]  10 videos at computex one video was at the corsair suite they were a sponsor of the show we said that
[356.64 --> 362.78]  it was sponsored by them um the other sponsor we had was glasspass who wasn't at the show and isn't
[362.78 --> 367.92]  a computer manufacturer so it wouldn't be at the show so 90 of the videos were not about the sponsor
[367.92 --> 373.96]  at computex yeah so so nine out of ten videos were not about corsair and oftentimes we'll have it where
[373.96 --> 379.90]  like i'm going to use corsair again i've done a show at pax where corsair was the sponsor and i covered
[379.90 --> 386.10]  like three or four competitors all positively and that was fine and everyone was okay and corsair was happy
[386.10 --> 389.84]  and we were happy and everyone else was happy and just my experience with this which is like
[389.84 --> 394.50]  obviously a lot more limited than someone like luke but i've spent a couple of years since i've been to
[394.50 --> 400.44]  a show for the company with ces but um a big part of my job when i was a ces at that year was just
[400.44 --> 408.46]  go around and find interesting stuff um sponsorship money any none of those sorts of considerations had
[408.46 --> 412.84]  nothing to do with what i was doing it was just walk around take notes if something is interesting
[412.84 --> 417.30]  get some b-roll of it maybe we can do a video on it that was literally it there was never anything
[417.30 --> 422.52]  shady exchanged in the background so yeah and that's that's another important point that i didn't
[422.52 --> 431.68]  mention um but like we don't do anything um where someone says you can't do this all of our sponsorships
[431.68 --> 437.44]  are just about what we can do um we don't do like exclusivity with anyone in the computer space
[437.44 --> 443.24]  at all yeah yeah it'd be a bad idea for us too is tying our hands as to what we can do which makes
[443.24 --> 447.30]  no sense from a business perspective so this is the thing that always makes me kind of chuckle is that
[447.30 --> 451.90]  people go oh you guys just want money you just want money if you think we're all about money
[451.90 --> 457.92]  what would be more intelligent taking some money now and potentially losing the trust of viewers
[457.92 --> 462.90]  or taking more money in the long term while maintaining the trust of viewers and partners
[462.90 --> 468.48]  like if you just think we're all about money the smart choice is for us to be honest about
[468.48 --> 472.36]  who we're being paid by because then we have long longevity and when you have a company of
[472.36 --> 477.98]  20 odd people i don't know the exact number but somewhere around there um and linus media group is
[477.98 --> 484.06]  indirectly kind of whole propping up float plane right now like that's a lot of people and literally
[484.06 --> 489.50]  companies to support you want a long-term solution you don't want a burst of money in a short period i
[489.50 --> 495.32]  think when scandals or alleged scandals like this pop up people tend to concentrate on short term like
[495.32 --> 501.72]  oh we have evidence of like this one deal that has this like impressive dollar amount on it maybe
[501.72 --> 507.60]  and that's obviously obviously like oh we have evidence of a thing that may have happened one time
[507.60 --> 512.42]  you know and that i think gets eyeballs it gets clicks as opposed to what you were just talking about
[512.42 --> 517.00]  where oh we're trying to like make as much as we can through like a long-term review of things
[517.00 --> 521.24]  and what's going to be sustainable for the long term that isn't particularly interesting to someone
[521.24 --> 527.64]  who wants to read about a youtuber scandal so and like most tech youtubers that i know of that i've
[527.64 --> 532.88]  watched their show coverage of do it in generally the same way uh that we do i'm not saying anyone's
[532.88 --> 537.00]  copying each other i'm not getting into that that doesn't matter but it's you you go to the show you
[537.00 --> 541.30]  do like your little right at the beginning of the video call out thank you for bringing me to the show
[541.30 --> 546.76]  you make a video about whatever happens to be there it'll probably include one to two videos of the
[546.76 --> 553.80]  company that brought you uh plus a whole ton like the last show we were at 90 of the videos were from
[553.80 --> 557.78]  unrelated companies and then at the end of the video you often do another call out thank you for
[557.78 --> 564.18]  bringing me a combutex and then you move on it's it's worked the same way for like five years or
[564.18 --> 572.48]  something i think we're probably like on the more aggressive end of like actually doing content with
[572.48 --> 577.86]  sponsors like that's what made me laugh about this like list or whatever was that like gamers nexus
[577.86 --> 584.44]  was included yeah and they're like the least chilly people you could think they will destroy everyone
[584.44 --> 589.46]  yeah yeah anyway i didn't want to make the whole show about this i just figured yeah i know well it
[589.46 --> 594.68]  was important to address because i know uh a lot of the other tech guys have been really vocal about
[594.68 --> 597.68]  this on twitter and jay made the video and i don't think we've really talked about it much
[597.68 --> 604.04]  we don't yeah we don't typically um he's the wan show for that kind of stuff so we decided to talk
[604.04 --> 610.28]  about it a little bit but yeah that's what it yeah okay thanks nick so yeah if you want if you
[610.28 --> 616.30]  want a little bit more information on stuff you can you can watch jay's video um i don't remember
[616.30 --> 621.88]  exactly what it's titled but i think it's his second most recent video give me one second
[621.88 --> 626.46]  it's called the truth about how i earn money and it's kind of cool because he goes into more stuff
[626.46 --> 631.84]  than just shows he runs down basically uh the like breadth of his business he talks about the
[631.84 --> 637.52]  merchandising line he talks about uh other deals that he's done and uh how he's trying to grow stuff
[637.52 --> 642.46]  like his uh personal branded merch and whatnot it's a little bit like the um the honest answer
[642.46 --> 646.26]  video that yeah did about how we make money although we're not accusing jay of like copying us or anything
[646.26 --> 651.60]  like that it's just a good it's a good thing to do i think so yeah it was i think it was a good it was
[651.60 --> 656.40]  really good timing and a good idea for jay to do his now and we did ours a while ago yes for
[656.40 --> 663.34]  i believe a similar reason i don't remember or not i don't think there was one big specific
[663.34 --> 668.48]  specific event i think just there was a lot of fans were questioning i think there was a lot of
[668.48 --> 674.08]  toxicity like in the comment sections of some of our videos between like that like the intel fans
[674.08 --> 680.06]  the amd fans the nvidia fans all going at each other and trying to say oh here here's who which
[680.06 --> 684.68]  which company's line is favoring the nvidia shill thing or something like that i think yeah yeah because
[684.68 --> 689.36]  i remember in that video we talked about how like nvidia's given us almost nothing uh we just make
[689.36 --> 692.88]  a lot of videos about them because people like their stuff and they're a lot of stuff they're
[692.88 --> 697.72]  they're huge i mean they're the biggest player in the gpu industry so we kind of uh and gpu videos do
[697.72 --> 704.20]  do really well um so yeah we have our honest answers thing jay has his truth about how i make money
[704.20 --> 709.68]  i recommend watching both of them i find them both very interesting yes even our like i knew all of
[709.68 --> 716.10]  ours already but even ours i think was was quite good um and yeah the fact that gamers nexus was
[716.10 --> 721.02]  included is hilarious because they just rip holes in everything they do so like yeah like their their
[721.02 --> 727.48]  stuff is like so technical and in-depth and like if you know if if any youtuber is going to try to get
[727.48 --> 732.72]  away with that kind of thing they would be they would have the hardest road to getting away with it
[732.72 --> 742.98]  so why you know i don't know but anyways moving on to a rumor love them rumors uh we we went from a
[742.98 --> 748.22]  rumor about us to a rumor about a tech company this is a wonderful show it's much less spicy though based
[748.22 --> 755.42]  on hardcore definite facts um so anyways there's a rumor about an eight core version of an 8700k
[755.42 --> 762.54]  that could be coming this fall this is uh by guru 3d and it was posted by rakanoth on the forum
[762.54 --> 767.68]  i'm gonna post this into the twitch chat real quick what what did i just do what am i doing
[767.68 --> 776.00]  i wasn't holding control i see there we go um but yeah it's it's people are kind of speculating that
[776.00 --> 784.30]  this isn't really this wasn't really planned for oh that sucks am i using the right thing uh and
[784.30 --> 791.72]  whether or not it was planned for it does seem quite reactionary uh maybe it was coming i suspect even if it
[791.72 --> 796.54]  was coming it was going to be coming later than it did end up coming i kind of think the truth is
[796.54 --> 800.72]  probably somewhere in the middle as we try to get our technical issues worked out here uh yeah
[800.72 --> 806.72]  i want to keep going with that yes i will okay so uh but yeah what i was going to say was um you know
[806.72 --> 811.20]  there's a question here in front of me does intel even have their own roadmap anymore or are they just
[811.20 --> 818.40]  being reactionary towards what amd is doing it might be a little bit of both um because all of oh there
[818.40 --> 824.02]  we go it's working now all of intel's difficulties trying to get a 10 nanometer chip to market have
[824.02 --> 830.14]  been very very well documented right like oh when are they going to originally release 10 nanometer
[830.14 --> 836.50]  like a year ago two years ago something like that yeah yeah so so they have to do something to keep
[836.50 --> 843.20]  innovating quote unquote innovating in the meantime but um you know amd did they force intel's hand here
[843.20 --> 849.92]  maybe a little bit um i do think it's really ironic that we're seeing so what it's um how many years
[849.92 --> 854.36]  has it been since the fx series from amd came out like seven years or so quite a while something like
[854.36 --> 861.08]  that so it's so it's so ironic now i think that intel is reacting and trying to compete with amd
[861.08 --> 868.32]  just by strapping more cores onto a cpu because an eight core i7 is not something we've seen on the
[868.32 --> 874.98]  mainstream consumer end you had originally or before you had to buy um an enthusiast platform
[874.98 --> 880.78]  an enthusiast motherboard to do that so uh but eight core version apparently coming uh this fall um no
[880.78 --> 885.92]  pricing information on that yet but um it's interesting because you know um obviously it is
[885.92 --> 890.06]  going to be the most cores we've ever seen from intel on a consumer platform but it is consumer yeah but
[890.06 --> 895.30]  it is kind of funny um you know seeing as the big knock on amd for a long time was oh they're selling
[895.30 --> 899.60]  these six and eight core cpus but who cares they're not really giving anyone the benefit so
[899.60 --> 905.44]  yeah um but the thing was especially back then with intel having so much of the market share
[905.44 --> 913.84]  no one was able to develop for that reasonably so now having amd cpus matter a lot more uh to be
[913.84 --> 919.06]  completely honest and having intel have to react to that and pump out a bunch of cores yeah meaning
[919.06 --> 922.88]  there's a lot more cores across the field meaning it'll make a lot more sense for developers to push
[922.88 --> 926.12]  for it which would be really cool because i don't know if you guys remember this but i used to make
[926.12 --> 932.92]  cores for gaming videos and i would do like oh it's summer 2014 how many cores do you need to game with
[932.92 --> 938.58]  and we stopped after i made like three or four of them because we were like well you could watch
[938.58 --> 943.94]  any of these and get the answer because it was the same thing every single time so hopefully this
[943.94 --> 948.64]  will actually mix that up definitely uh we can make another course for gaming video yeah you know
[948.64 --> 953.48]  and obviously there's been development challenges just with how you know the stuff is actually
[953.48 --> 958.56]  coded to spread the work cloud out load out among more cores but you know there might be more effort
[958.56 --> 962.74]  put into that now that what you were saying there's just more cores out there where where you have
[962.74 --> 968.48]  a chip with four cores eight threads or you know six and twelve is just a more mainstream choice now so
[968.48 --> 973.30]  it's it's you always have to have one obviously the software or the hardware has to come first
[973.30 --> 978.50]  usually it's easier for the industry if the hardware comes first i know with some certain
[978.50 --> 982.76]  games that have come out and stuff it's been like oh wow hardware really isn't ready for this yet yeah
[982.76 --> 987.44]  like nothing can run this yeah yeah exactly and then that's usually a fairly uncomfortable spot for
[987.44 --> 993.34]  the industry to be in it's fun i enjoy that space but it's fairly uncomfortable for consumers to be
[993.34 --> 997.28]  constantly needing to replace all their stuff to be able to do anything so having the hardware
[997.28 --> 1001.28]  first is good so we're going to get eight core out there and get people used to it and have developers
[1001.28 --> 1008.86]  start using it more often that would be pretty sweet and awesome absolutely it is it is a little
[1008.86 --> 1014.86]  bit of a kick in the pants for people who recently i know someone specifically who like just bought a
[1014.86 --> 1020.38]  new processor uh that being said this isn't coming until fall so it will be a little while uh but like
[1020.38 --> 1028.10]  the 8086 i7 8086k like just came out yeah that was and it's pretty sweet but like that was like a nice
[1028.10 --> 1033.86]  little stunt for however many weeks that was yeah chip to get but and then now it's like oh coming
[1033.86 --> 1039.60]  this fall you've got an eight core version of an 8700k so it's like it's like what if you like spend a
[1039.60 --> 1046.42]  ton of money you buy a house and the house has like trim where it's um where the cabinets are a certain
[1046.42 --> 1051.08]  color or certain style that was that was in for like literally a month yeah then everyone thinks it's
[1051.08 --> 1057.22]  ugly this is yeah so if you buy the expensive cpu it's a bit like that so oh man yeah i couldn't give
[1057.22 --> 1062.64]  two craps about cabinets but i totally understand the reference um gotta get that resale value man
[1062.64 --> 1067.86]  it's it's great when you walk into someone's house who's been like perfectly maintained done a really
[1067.86 --> 1072.38]  good job of keeping their house up but they haven't changed a single thing in it since like the mid 90s
[1072.38 --> 1078.36]  they have like lurid pink wallpaper with like a awesome yeah it's actually so cool i just it's it's like a
[1078.36 --> 1088.10]  time capsule um okay and moving on to something that i know nothing about at all so good luck uh
[1088.10 --> 1095.66]  at&t closes the time warner deal this sounds terrible to me i don't know i don't know anything
[1095.66 --> 1104.36]  about it uh a federal judge ruled on tuesday that at&t's 85.4 billion dollar bid for time warner
[1104.36 --> 1110.50]  was legal imposing no conditions on the merger all of this despite a lawsuit from the justice
[1110.50 --> 1114.84]  department arguing that the deal would be anti-competitive and oh my goodness how is it not
[1114.84 --> 1120.18]  i don't understand i can tell you a little bit about that please give me one quick second before
[1120.18 --> 1126.14]  you do that sure i i kind of bait and switched you there we're gonna use uh the verge.com for our
[1126.14 --> 1132.08]  source and thank you to sherman tanker for posting this on the forum you're good to go okay um so
[1132.08 --> 1140.04]  so when i was in law school just a quick disclaimer i didn't learn a ton about antitrust if you watch
[1140.04 --> 1145.20]  like if you watch tech wiki and the videos we've sort of done like law and tech a lot of it has to
[1145.20 --> 1149.36]  do with intellectual property because i took a lot of intellectual property in law school so talking
[1149.36 --> 1152.62]  about copyrights and like what you can do with content online and how you can share it and that
[1152.62 --> 1157.40]  sort of thing um but here's why i can tell you about antitrust and just in case you don't even know
[1157.40 --> 1163.64]  what antitrust is um antitrust law basically concerns companies that get too big the idea of
[1163.64 --> 1169.36]  antitrust law is to prevent monopolies is to prevent one company dominating the marketplace for
[1169.36 --> 1174.94]  a certain thing you know imagine if the only company out there making monitors was lg for example
[1174.94 --> 1180.96]  that wouldn't be good you would have no choice in what you could buy so uh so with this um what's
[1180.96 --> 1185.86]  happening is at&t which is obviously a huge telecommunications company they run you know back
[1185.86 --> 1190.62]  in the day that are most known for running phone networks these days are a huge isp um they just
[1190.62 --> 1198.36]  bought um time warner which includes um some really big like media properties uh hbo cnn um warner
[1198.36 --> 1204.18]  brothers basically everything warner brothers does is owned by time warner so what this is called is
[1204.18 --> 1208.72]  called um a vertical merger and the reason it's called a vertical merger is because you have one
[1208.72 --> 1215.26]  company buying another company that does something different or more specifically one company provides
[1215.26 --> 1221.08]  the other company with with supplies or it's a or supply chain right so um in this case time warner
[1221.08 --> 1227.04]  is providing content they're providing like i said they're um they own hbo and cnn so they're providing
[1227.04 --> 1232.36]  game of thrones or the sopranos or the wolf blitzer show or whatever people watch on cnn i don't know i
[1232.36 --> 1239.52]  don't watch cnn anymore but um so and but you know at&t is the isp so um they're providing the content
[1239.52 --> 1245.68]  that at&t can deliver down their pipes so that's what we mean by a vertical merger there's also a
[1245.68 --> 1249.88]  horizontal merger which is a little bit simpler where one company buys another company that does
[1249.88 --> 1253.68]  basically the same thing imagine if ups bought fedex for example right that would be a horizontal
[1253.68 --> 1259.96]  merger but so when when the government so is that like a vertical merger would be like you you buy
[1259.96 --> 1265.26]  functionality and a horizontal merger would almost be like you buy market share yeah that's that's not a
[1265.26 --> 1269.18]  bad way to put roughly yeah you're buying functionality or buying supplies like to help
[1269.18 --> 1274.18]  you somehow you know right so um like imagine if mcdonald's like have their own farms that would be
[1274.18 --> 1279.46]  vertical integration you know tesla has purchased a few like manufacturing companies yeah and like
[1279.46 --> 1283.10]  like companies that are into like tools and manufacturing and whatnot so that probably helps
[1283.10 --> 1289.50]  them vertically i'm not sure exactly how to classify that because i think um i think it was also
[1289.50 --> 1296.58]  manufacturing yeah yeah i'm not exactly sure but anyway so um so so specifically talking about this
[1296.58 --> 1303.86]  um so the justice department of the u.s took um att to court afraid that this would make att too big
[1303.86 --> 1311.70]  um there's like an antitrust concern here with just way too much market power but um legally it is um
[1311.70 --> 1315.64]  and i was actually looking at the judge's decision which is like 200 pages long and full of legalese
[1315.64 --> 1321.92]  obviously earlier but one key thing he mentioned was that in a horizontal merger courts usually have
[1321.92 --> 1325.80]  a little bit easier time deciding you can just say oh you're buying another company that does
[1325.80 --> 1329.70]  something similar so let's just look at how much market share you'll have now and if it's too much
[1329.70 --> 1334.64]  market share we'll just say you can't do this it's easy a vertical merger is a lot more difficult
[1334.64 --> 1339.98]  because you're buying a company that does something else so these sorts of cases they tend to be very
[1339.98 --> 1345.48]  fact intensive there is very case-by-case basis and just based on that alone the government
[1345.48 --> 1351.24]  immediately already had a tougher time proving its case to go in front of a judge and saying
[1351.24 --> 1357.18]  and say hey att buying time warner is going to be really bad for consumers um it wasn't good enough
[1357.18 --> 1362.74]  for to get the court to buy it and the judge said get out and they let att do the merger and that's
[1362.74 --> 1369.16]  kind of it so so people are saying this in twitch chat and i i there's one guy that just says bored
[1369.16 --> 1379.34]  other than that dude that happens uh on every every story we talk about though um i've someone said
[1379.34 --> 1384.24]  this in twitch chat and i've read this before online in some in the 80s or something they broke up at&t
[1384.24 --> 1390.22]  because it's too big yeah um and now they're letting them merge and become bigger the idea back
[1390.22 --> 1395.78]  then and obviously you and i were both well what year were you born i was not alive okay luke didn't
[1395.78 --> 1402.06]  exist and i was like tiny in the 80s i was born in 87 but um back in the 80s before like everyone had
[1402.06 --> 1410.12]  the internet um at&t ran a bunch of they provided um don't completely quote me on this but i think what
[1410.12 --> 1418.20]  happened is they had both long distance and local um telephone service and they just controlled so much
[1418.20 --> 1422.12]  of the telephone market i know they were a huge deal in telephone back in the day yeah they could
[1422.12 --> 1426.28]  just control so much the telephone market and what ended up happening is the u.s government broke
[1426.28 --> 1431.98]  up their local operations into they call them the baby bells and these were companies that were
[1431.98 --> 1436.76]  spun off as independent but they served like different chunks geographical chunks of the u.s
[1436.76 --> 1441.76]  but that's a little bit different because we're talking about the same things phone service this is a
[1441.76 --> 1447.94]  little bit different because you have an isp buying the folks who own hbo right so it's a little bit
[1447.94 --> 1454.26]  different at&t was divested in 1983 by the united states government it had natural monopoly over the
[1454.26 --> 1458.38]  telecommunication lines such as telegraph and telephone and they were the only group basically
[1458.38 --> 1462.62]  that's right so yeah so that's quite a bit different than it is now the baby bells were
[1462.62 --> 1469.06]  stripped up into pieces like bell south atlantic bell etc they slowly consolidated back into companies
[1469.06 --> 1474.04]  like at&t verizon yeah that's right when i was a kid our local our local phone provider was bell
[1474.04 --> 1480.82]  south and they were one of the ex-at&t companies so interesting okay all right well moving on from
[1480.82 --> 1485.74]  that just in case you're hashtag bored yeah and like that dude in chat was it was really funny because
[1485.74 --> 1492.52]  this happens right as the net neutrality repeal yeah it was a thing so yeah so hopefully there won't
[1492.52 --> 1496.16]  be fast lanes for game of thrones but i guess if you're a game of thrones fanatic you'll be happy about
[1496.16 --> 1502.74]  that but the most pirated show let's see how that goes for them um apple tries to stop developers
[1502.74 --> 1508.62]  from sharing use uh data on their users friends this immediately sounds like a good thing to me
[1508.62 --> 1514.02]  but i don't really know yet uh it's posted by anover5 on the forum and the source we're going to
[1514.02 --> 1519.44]  use is bloomberg.com how do you feel so pro when we use bloomberg as a source like because you turn
[1519.44 --> 1524.60]  on bloomberg tv there's always financial stuff going on i didn't even know bloomberg tv was a thing
[1524.60 --> 1531.74]  just seems very pro you know anyway it has a cool name okay um apple inc changed its app store rules
[1531.74 --> 1536.60]  last week to limit how developers use information about iphone owners friends and other contacts
[1536.60 --> 1541.26]  quietly closing a loophole that let app makers store and share data without many people's consent
[1541.26 --> 1548.78]  yay good thing thank you apple for closing a said loophole i think that's kind of the gist of it i'm
[1548.78 --> 1552.72]  going to get this uh nice lady off the screen because i don't know what she's actually talking about
[1552.72 --> 1560.12]  and we're going to go back to here um but yeah apparently many developers ask users for access
[1560.12 --> 1566.12]  to their phone's contacts only use it for marketing or sometimes um or sometimes share and sell the
[1566.12 --> 1571.36]  information all without permission from the people listed in those digital address books that's the
[1571.36 --> 1579.30]  problem is that your phone your address book those people's information other companies running apps
[1579.30 --> 1585.46]  are able to take that and sell it um whereas that's supposed to maybe only be used for like
[1585.46 --> 1591.46]  sharing things or seeing if you have other friends that are online you know how some games you can like
[1591.46 --> 1596.14]  import your address book and then see if your friends are online well they might sell that and that's bad
[1596.14 --> 1601.14]  i feel like this is a gdpr thing or it might be like they may have done this in response to gdpr
[1601.14 --> 1606.42]  like i don't that's just me speculating but it seems like the timing seems like that might be why
[1606.42 --> 1615.34]  well i think because this sounds like something that will be absolutely not allowed by the gdpr
[1615.34 --> 1622.08]  yeah where your data is getting used and you have no idea what's going on with it i just think in this
[1622.08 --> 1628.56]  case both companies might be a fault yes uh so i think apple's trying to close their end but this is
[1628.56 --> 1632.72]  also a problem for app developers they would both be in trouble or that law of apple for not like
[1632.72 --> 1637.52]  securing the data and passing it on and then the app developers for using it without permission so so
[1637.52 --> 1642.02]  apple's probably just taking care of that definitely needs to be taken care of um the new app store
[1642.02 --> 1649.22]  review guidelines bar developers uh sorry the new app store review guidelines bar developers from
[1649.22 --> 1655.30]  making databases of address book information they gather from iphone users sharing and selling that
[1655.30 --> 1659.62]  database with third parties is now forbidden probably should have been already but whatever
[1659.62 --> 1664.90]  an app can't get a user's contact list say it's being used for one thing and then use it again for
[1664.90 --> 1670.54]  something else unless the developer gets consent again obviously this can still be abused but i think it's a
[1670.54 --> 1675.80]  vector for apple to rip you off the app store so if they catch you doing this you'll get you'll get
[1675.80 --> 1680.94]  tossed right um anyone yeah anyone caught breaking the rules may be banned this sounds like an extremely
[1680.94 --> 1687.44]  easy rule to break and probably not that hard of a rule to get away with breaking um but at least
[1687.44 --> 1692.20]  they have it written out now that they can give you the boot if you do break it uh when users like
[1692.20 --> 1696.92]  like honestly it yeah no it does this whole thing reminds me the reason i'm laughing a little bit is
[1696.92 --> 1702.92]  of in android p i think they took away the ability for apps to use your camera microphone in the background
[1702.92 --> 1708.34]  which was cool but i was like what were they doing before yeah like what were they listening to me like
[1708.34 --> 1714.92]  all the time before android p i so i don't uh yeah uh when users install apps and then consent
[1714.92 --> 1720.34]  developers get dozens of potential data points on people's friends contact lists and contain phone
[1720.34 --> 1725.12]  numbers email addresses profile photos and tons of other stuff as you probably know so that database
[1725.12 --> 1730.08]  of information is probably quite valuable um so now what they'll probably have to do is sell it to
[1730.08 --> 1735.26]  themselves as another company and then anonymize the data and sell it that way so it'll add one more loop
[1735.26 --> 1739.80]  that they have to jump through for apple to not be able to catch them so all right at least apple
[1739.80 --> 1745.78]  is clean to their hands uh but this will still remain an issue um just in case anyone was wondering
[1745.78 --> 1751.94]  moving on i just sort of assume that everyone on the internet just knows everything about me
[1751.94 --> 1760.62]  yeah easier way to live yeah yeah another rumor because this show again is only about things that are
[1760.62 --> 1769.40]  confirmed 100 true uh rumor amd radeon rx 680 the radeon rx 680 will reportedly be powered by the navi gpu
[1769.40 --> 1779.04]  architecture um and will feature eight gigabytes of gddr6 with the performance of the gtx 1080 or gtx 1080
[1779.04 --> 1785.42]  or so an expected price range of 300 to 400 bucks that's actually really good because looking at the
[1785.42 --> 1791.04]  stories about what nvidia is going to be allegedly because like you said this these are all 100%
[1791.04 --> 1796.08]  confirmed facts on the show of this show but um yeah but anyway um seriously there was um everyone
[1796.08 --> 1803.06]  saying or a lot of people are saying july 30th for um the um what's the code name for the next um not
[1803.06 --> 1808.40]  volta but it's um oh twitch chat is probably screaming at me with it right now i was writing about this
[1808.40 --> 1815.66]  earlier today and i've already forgotten it nvidia roadmap what is your thing called
[1815.66 --> 1824.40]  nope that's old just search that's hold on i'll get it here hold on
[1825.86 --> 1832.22]  twitch chat is streaming at me right now i'm sure touring touring touring touring like like oh yeah
[1832.22 --> 1838.16]  touring or ampere so here was the one i had in my head so um they're supposed to be releasing snorkel
[1838.16 --> 1843.86]  they're supposed to be releasing touring at the end of july but it's just going to be the higher
[1843.86 --> 1849.94]  end silicon to begin with as is tradition you know yeah so and the the rumor is that the the high end
[1849.94 --> 1854.92]  card will cost between a thousand and fifteen hundred depending on how much vram you get with it
[1854.92 --> 1859.56]  so something like this could be really appealing if you could say oh well i don't have a thousand
[1859.56 --> 1866.54]  dollars but i can spend 350 bucks on something with 1080 like performance so yeah uh someone in chat said
[1866.54 --> 1868.24]  please please please please make this
[1868.24 --> 1877.94]  square bracket anecdote poopy for mining and great for gaming um i doubt it
[1877.94 --> 1887.34]  eight gigs of gdr6 should probably be pretty smoking for mining um well i mean i i don't i don't know if
[1887.34 --> 1892.94]  you can you know really make a card like that you know what i mean because uh memory is super
[1892.94 --> 1897.18]  important for mining oh no i know but my point is just more like if he's worried about price
[1897.18 --> 1901.54]  this looks like it will be affordable because obviously there's this huge artificial inflation
[1901.54 --> 1905.86]  with the pricing um we'll have to see like immediately after this card comes out a bunch
[1905.86 --> 1910.36]  of miners gonna get their hands on of it on on of it a bunch of miners will get their hands on it
[1910.36 --> 1914.58]  we're both i feel like we're both slow today it's been like a long week yeah it has been a long week
[1914.58 --> 1921.22]  um so we'll see how it how it goes but looking at its price point looking at its performance this
[1921.22 --> 1926.70]  could be a big card for mining but mining isn't all super hype right now yeah uh so maybe it'll be
[1926.70 --> 1930.10]  okay you know things change quickly yeah like a couple months ago was a completely different story
[1930.10 --> 1936.14]  and also this is an interesting side note andy will release a navi 20 on 7 nanometer as a high-end
[1936.14 --> 1943.44]  gpu in the 2020 to 2021 time frame oh boy so 7 nanometer gpu from amd so keep your eyes out for that
[1943.44 --> 1950.00]  they're smashing it man it's cool i'm happy for them speaking of happy savage jerky
[1950.00 --> 1956.32]  i have a new favorite it's mojo jalapeno that's habanero my friend oh no oh no that was habanero
[1956.32 --> 1960.40]  sorry no that the other one did we have another thing over there that says habanero i'm very sorry
[1960.40 --> 1966.06]  it is mojo jalapeno i can't i was like holy cow i'm slow today no i'm slow today look at me

[1997.00 --> 2001.92]  they're both very very good i've to be fair anyone who has the like bacon flavors i prefer the beef
[2001.92 --> 2007.08]  jerky ones oh okay so it's it's not a preference yeah yeah yeah it's it's not a uh savage jerky so
[2007.08 --> 2013.38]  whether so whether you like dead pig or dead cow savage jerky will have something for you got you
[2013.38 --> 2022.48]  covered especially if you want some jalapeno um you guys know these guys as of now like the least
[2022.48 --> 2027.92]  surprising sponsor spot ever yeah i mean savage jerky is to the wan show as fresh books is to tech
[2027.92 --> 2036.36]  wiki by this point pretty much um sorry that's a good thing their jerky is made with great ingredients
[2036.36 --> 2043.10]  no nitrates no preservatives uh they've got 13 different types of jerky 13 different
[2043.10 --> 2047.96]  flavors of jerky i should say people seem to love the sriracha bacon i'm super not surprised
[2047.96 --> 2054.22]  that john grabbed that one mabel buffalo bacon is also super popular they also make barbecue sauce
[2054.22 --> 2060.80]  hot sauce and spice rubs uh they also have carolina reaper hot sauce which is the world's hottest pepper
[2060.80 --> 2064.82]  yes it's not the world's hottest hot sauce so you can actually like eat it and it's fine
[2064.82 --> 2070.36]  but it is made with the world's hottest pepper which is pretty insane they've even got an awesome
[2070.36 --> 2076.74]  savage jerky gift tool bag that's really cool yeah uh which includes four packs of jerky hot sauce
[2076.74 --> 2082.30]  herb blend or spice rub and it makes an awesome gift i've never seen they bring up a picture of it
[2082.30 --> 2090.58]  yeah give me a sec savage jerky tool bag it's pronouncing the h in herb a canadian thing a lot
[2090.58 --> 2096.28]  of americans just british thing i think canadians flip it back and forth interesting because herb and
[2096.28 --> 2101.14]  herb both sound perfectly fine to me there i go because canadians are weird the more you know
[2101.14 --> 2103.44]  here it is what the heck
[2103.44 --> 2116.00]  that's a but you get a husky tool bag a straight up husky tool bag is included okay i was expecting
[2116.00 --> 2121.32]  that was going to be like kind of a fako part of it but it is not um you get four bags of jerky one
[2121.32 --> 2130.46]  bottle of hot sauce one bottle of uh herb herb blend or spice rub uh one savage jerky uh koozie
[2130.46 --> 2137.66]  i've screwed that up before i think i called it a kazoo oh but it's a koozie that's great uh and
[2137.66 --> 2143.94]  two savage jerky stickers that's actually pretty cool and this isn't in my notes but i always warn
[2143.94 --> 2149.42]  people when there's certain special dates coming up on my twitter but i'll do a wan show warning here
[2149.42 --> 2155.00]  it's father's day on sunday so if you need something and they can get it to you fast enough
[2155.00 --> 2162.16]  i don't know what their shipping speed is but this might be a decent idea um jumping back to
[2162.16 --> 2169.84]  other sponsors let's do right and sorry savage jerky but the the link over here savage jerky.com
[2169.84 --> 2175.96]  use offer code ltts save 10 uh so you can save money on the on the tool bag if you want to get that
[2175.96 --> 2181.64]  or you can just buy some buy some bacon and save money on it saving money on bacon is always a good
[2181.64 --> 2188.22]  thing and moving on we have moss backpacks i love these bags and i do the same thing every time
[2188.22 --> 2194.38]  because it just makes me super happy but all of their bags have this really bright orange inside
[2194.38 --> 2200.38]  and it's lovely how well it shows up on camera too because it's just awesome and it really proves my
[2200.38 --> 2207.80]  point it's extremely easy to find stuff in here let's let's grab mojo jalapeno it even has orange
[2207.80 --> 2212.40]  on it it's still going to be super easy to find cross branding look it's right there look how easy
[2212.40 --> 2217.32]  that is it's a black package in a bag that's often really really hard to find because most people make
[2217.32 --> 2222.14]  their bags with uh with black insides it's like a small touch it makes a big difference you know it
[2222.14 --> 2228.22]  really does i i i i have a backpack that has an orange inside and i will never ever go back
[2228.22 --> 2235.54]  it also has the like the air porter zippers so you can lay your bag out like that really easy
[2235.54 --> 2241.88]  so you can get through everything super wide open uh it's got nice little like mesh things you have a
[2241.88 --> 2247.40]  bottle in there or some cards or whatever it has a little card that explains how you can use it if you
[2247.40 --> 2253.36]  don't want to listen to me um and i like this too you guys aren't going to be able to see this very
[2253.36 --> 2258.20]  well but in the thin top zipper you know how a lot of bags will have like the the small zipper
[2258.20 --> 2266.00]  at the top this one right here if you open that up the pocket inside is like a reinforced area it's
[2266.00 --> 2273.48]  not i don't think it's plastic or anything and it's covered in like a felt like material i i probably
[2273.48 --> 2277.54]  called it wrong i'm not very good at identifying materials but it's a very soft type of material
[2277.54 --> 2283.58]  that's on top of some formed cup like shape so if you put something in there that's relatively fragile
[2283.58 --> 2289.54]  and you have big stuff in here that wax into it it'll be okay because the cup thing is going to
[2289.54 --> 2293.70]  keep its shape and project protect whatever you put inside that's actually kind of cool that's a
[2293.70 --> 2299.20]  good idea i haven't really seen that in a lot of bags before we're showing off their other one as well
[2299.20 --> 2305.40]  if you want this is the black pack if you want a different type of bag um one thing that i really
[2305.40 --> 2311.84]  like about these guys too is they'll have uh on on different bags they'll have um this guy can i pull
[2311.84 --> 2318.32]  this out aha it's a wall plug why do you need a wall plug for your backpack well it's and it nicely
[2318.32 --> 2322.26]  tucks on the side of the bag as well so you don't even have to open up your bag to get access well you
[2322.26 --> 2326.66]  don't have to open up the main compartments of your bag to get access to it that wall plug is for this
[2326.66 --> 2332.90]  this has a standard plug so you plug your laptop or something into it it has two usb ports one of them
[2332.90 --> 2336.48]  is already plugged in because the cable feeds through to the front of the case but you could
[2336.48 --> 2340.86]  unplug it put whatever you want in there the cable that comes with it is actually nice reinforced
[2340.86 --> 2346.92]  with a spring so that the cable isn't gonna like get damaged in your bag which makes sense because
[2346.92 --> 2350.92]  it's gonna stay in your bag um i don't know i think that's wonderful because you could just get
[2350.92 --> 2355.90]  home plug your bag into the wall and it automatically charges everything that's in it just waiting around
[2355.90 --> 2362.02]  at the airport you just want to charge all your stuff at once boom done someone yes someone tweeted me
[2362.02 --> 2369.04]  after the last moss backpack sponsorship um talking about like oh that's just expecting trouble because
[2369.04 --> 2373.08]  someone's gonna plug it into the wall and walk away from it and it's gonna get determined as a bomb
[2373.08 --> 2379.90]  just don't don't walk away from your don't walk away from it like uh most of the plugs in airports that
[2379.90 --> 2385.22]  people designing these airports generally know that people want to charge their stuff so most of the
[2385.22 --> 2391.06]  plugs are near seats have a sit do whatever you need to do if you want to go get some food or go to the
[2391.06 --> 2395.94]  washroom unplug take your backpack with you like you normally would so that people don't think it's
[2395.94 --> 2400.62]  a bomb in an airport that's like they they say over the loudspeakers the whole time do not leave
[2400.62 --> 2405.94]  luggage unattended it is still luggage despite having a plug that was what i was going to say like i'm
[2405.94 --> 2410.58]  pretty sure they would treat it an unattended bag as suspicious even if there weren't a cable sticking
[2410.58 --> 2415.44]  out of it yeah like it doesn't matter so yeah yeah so that has nothing to do with anything
[2415.44 --> 2420.62]  great backpacks i love the plug feature i love the orange i love the cup thing that they're doing
[2420.62 --> 2428.80]  uh but yeah uh check it out at the link below if you are on uh youtube or just check them out on
[2428.80 --> 2435.70]  kickstarter if you look moss backpacks on kickstarter kickstarter interesting um and should be good to go
[2435.70 --> 2439.22]  i think they're doing another campaign because these guys definitely have had laptops out before
[2439.22 --> 2445.60]  i i personally know someone who has bought them off of their website so i'm assuming it's a it's a
[2445.60 --> 2451.98]  new thingy they're doing on on kickstarter uh sounds like it i'm assuming that's the black pack that
[2451.98 --> 2458.94]  they're kickstartering anyways beyond there we have ltx ltx expo if you want to come visit the team
[2458.94 --> 2465.34]  meet the team meet me even though i'm not on the team oh that makes sense um come to ltx it's a meetup
[2465.34 --> 2470.88]  an interactive tech event the interactive part here is important i feel like it always takes away
[2470.88 --> 2475.82]  i feel like we need to get like testimonials from people that go next time so we can play them
[2475.82 --> 2481.88]  it isn't just an event about passive absorption yeah i feel like it takes a little bit away from
[2481.88 --> 2486.34]  it because it's an event we're holding and i'm the one talking about it but ltx is legitimately one
[2486.34 --> 2491.10]  of the coolest events i've been to i've only been to one because there's only been one uh but the
[2491.10 --> 2495.18]  interactive part is super cool because you go to these conventions and when i went to
[2495.18 --> 2498.32]  conventions when i was younger they were a little bit more grungy a little bit less planned out
[2498.32 --> 2505.20]  and there was a little bit more uh hand-on action because like i remember packs when i first went
[2505.20 --> 2511.36]  there they'd just be hucking prizes out of the booths there'd be more hands-on stuff because uh
[2511.36 --> 2514.94]  it was a smaller con it was a smaller con they weren't as worried about things then they started
[2514.94 --> 2519.72]  getting in trouble for different stuff and they had to close it down we are keeping that in mind we
[2519.72 --> 2524.00]  don't want to get in trouble for stuff but we're keeping all the booths interactive so like one of the
[2524.00 --> 2528.44]  really cool things that's coming this year is how to do delid your cpu so you can bring a cpu and
[2528.44 --> 2534.74]  you'll have professional people showing you how to delid it in person where else can you get that
[2534.74 --> 2541.18]  i literally think nowhere um really cool um every single booth is going to have some type of
[2541.18 --> 2547.68]  interactive uh setup with it current booths include a blind cable management competition brought to you
[2547.68 --> 2551.82]  by cable mod a delidding workshop so you can bring your cpus and we'll show you how to delid it
[2551.82 --> 2558.36]  case toss 2.0 hopefully you'll do better than i did multi-headed vr a 20 pc land brought to you by
[2558.36 --> 2566.24]  ibuypower the 12k ultra wide gaming setup and tons tons more i guarantee there will be tons more uh
[2566.24 --> 2569.14]  there is already tons more i don't know why it's not listed here probably just because it'd be way
[2569.14 --> 2574.90]  too much to say there's also going to be food music cool systems to look at more room more swag
[2574.90 --> 2580.12]  and more special guests than last year there will be exclusive live unboxings just like last year
[2580.12 --> 2585.06]  and more you can come hang out with us the tickets start at 35 canadian and you can check them out
[2585.06 --> 2591.04]  through the link below or because you're watching on twitch right now uh get or unless you're watching
[2591.04 --> 2598.66]  this later that's i said right now and that's relative so if you're watching it at 5 49 uh pacific time
[2598.66 --> 2609.04]  uh yeah on on friday then the link is just ltx expo.com but if not link below it's only 26 50
[2609.04 --> 2615.94]  usd for our american viewers it's nothing yeah it's not it's not that expensive and it's a really fun
[2615.94 --> 2620.26]  convention i want people to go i want people to go because i want to keep doing it because it's
[2620.26 --> 2625.58]  it's literally last year's was more fun for me than last year's pax was and i've been going to pax
[2625.58 --> 2631.04]  since i was yeah the last year's ltx was very enjoyable i agree 100 with that even like as an
[2631.04 --> 2636.74]  attendee i'm going to be 100 honest here i didn't invite most of my like personal friends to ltx last
[2636.74 --> 2640.98]  year yeah because i was like it's probably just going to be a fan meetup there's going to be a few
[2640.98 --> 2644.28]  things to do but it's probably mostly going to be a fan meetup and then i was like holy crap i feel
[2644.28 --> 2648.72]  pretty bad because it was really fun and none of the none of them came so i didn't invite them so
[2648.72 --> 2656.22]  wrecked uh but they're invited this year because it'll be good uh moving back to normal news whoop
[2656.22 --> 2662.66]  wrong screen i gotta stop beating that savage jerky man it's so good nope keep going who cares okay
[2662.66 --> 2669.64]  uh it's your bag as far as i'm concerned that's true you don't have to stop uh let's move on
[2670.46 --> 2678.56]  new ios security feature has already been bypassed oh boy uh this was posted by captain to fire
[2678.56 --> 2686.16]  on the forum and our source is the forum uh but yeah ios 12 introduces a new usb restricted mode
[2686.16 --> 2691.48]  that makes it harder for law enforcement agencies to thwart iphone security usb restricted mode
[2691.48 --> 2698.14]  requires that an iphone be unlocked with a passable with a passcode when connected to a computer via usb
[2698.14 --> 2704.10]  if the device has not already been unlocked in the last hour wow meaning phone hacking and forensic
[2704.10 --> 2710.34]  tools shouldn't be able to unlock phones in an email obtained by vice a forensic expert claims
[2710.34 --> 2716.76]  that gray shift has already defeated apple's new usb restricted mode in a beta build usb restricted
[2716.76 --> 2722.50]  mode is currently in beta testing and will launch to the public soon according to apple is this big like
[2722.50 --> 2728.98]  cat and mouse game between apple and the government yeah and this is just the latest chapter of that
[2728.98 --> 2735.12]  there was some um and there was some district attorney down in louisiana who was saying that
[2735.12 --> 2741.18]  apple was literally promoting criminal activity by doing this and i'm just sitting here like if you
[2741.18 --> 2746.92]  want people to take you seriously and be on your side maybe don't say things like that but regardless
[2746.92 --> 2753.58]  of how you feel about it um this the fact that it's already been defeated is a little bit humorous to me
[2753.58 --> 2759.66]  just because like i said there's this constant arms race between it's just like apple and these um
[2759.66 --> 2763.58]  these law enforcement folks who because the fbi has been lobbying for years and years to
[2763.58 --> 2768.72]  try to force apple to have a back door into their products if they want to do an investigation so
[2768.72 --> 2775.38]  yeah i think um it could have something to do with the betaness of the build because they
[2775.38 --> 2783.28]  beat it on the beta possibly um and we have had security firms lie about beating apple's
[2783.28 --> 2787.84]  security before eventually they've kind of figured it out but they've they've lied in the early term
[2787.84 --> 2793.04]  what do we know about gray shift who knows off the top of my head not a ton i've heard of them before
[2793.04 --> 2796.24]  um gray shifts
[2796.24 --> 2806.08]  uh they sell phone unlocking services gray shift iphone unlocker
[2806.08 --> 2814.20]  mysterious 15 000 gray key promises to unlock iphone x for whatever yeah they're they're a phone
[2814.20 --> 2820.60]  unlocking thing i've heard of them before i just wasn't sure to be fair if it's that i'm starting
[2820.60 --> 2827.24]  to remember a little bit more about them now if it's them they probably did it oh um so wrecked i guess
[2827.24 --> 2834.30]  um yeah oh well we'll see if it holds through with the beta but even if it doesn't when you've got
[2834.30 --> 2839.48]  groups like gray shift constantly consistently going after your stuff and making a profit on it
[2839.48 --> 2845.64]  in a government sanctioned way you're probably boned yeah you because you you have an incentive
[2845.64 --> 2852.30]  essentially everything's hackable right so like at some point yeah that sucks um microsoft to help
[2852.30 --> 2858.56]  walmart get rid of cashiers oh my uh microsoft is reportedly working on this was posted by no one
[2858.56 --> 2865.76]  maybe uh but our source is arstechnica.com microsoft is reportedly working on technology that removes
[2865.76 --> 2870.88]  the need for cashiers and checkout lines and stores similar to amazon's technology already implemented in
[2870.88 --> 2876.14]  its amazon go brick and mortar store uh so microsoft is essentially doing the same thing as them
[2876.14 --> 2881.10]  the exact technology isn't explained but it may be linked to the company's new
[2881.10 --> 2888.16]  connect uh for azure project this project builds on connect's current abilities and can be used
[2888.16 --> 2894.04]  to execute spatial mapping and motion tracking while it's unclear how far along microsoft is in
[2894.04 --> 2898.92]  developing this technology the company has reportedly shown sample tech to potential partners and has even
[2898.92 --> 2905.64]  talked to walmart about implementing it directly amazon is expected to open new go locations in chicago
[2905.64 --> 2911.08]  and san francisco soon microsoft is making interesting moves this is a big deal
[2911.08 --> 2917.56]  to me because because okay so amazon go they're putting the technology they have one store in
[2917.56 --> 2923.24]  seattle they're playing two more okay and they're gonna put in whole foods right i mean they're i mean
[2923.24 --> 2929.12]  they're not as big as walmart but they're a big chain this to me is like microsoft saying okay well i'll
[2929.12 --> 2936.00]  see your little dinky operation at whole foods and i'll raise you walmart you know so we're talking about
[2936.00 --> 2943.32]  like the biggest retailer in the u.s and microsoft is trying to just it looks almost like amazon's
[2943.32 --> 2949.98]  trying to like own the full stack essentially like they they want the store they want the technology in
[2949.98 --> 2954.94]  the store they want everything and microsoft is like no we don't need everything we just want to
[2954.94 --> 2959.16]  have this we'll see if they can do it because i think the challenge here is that microsoft sort of
[2959.16 --> 2964.76]  cloud processing processing capability it's not quite as big as amazon's is with aws so we'll see how that
[2964.76 --> 2971.46]  works out for them yeah um that's quite interesting well we'll see though because microsoft buying github
[2971.46 --> 2979.88]  and making this move right now is probably what the kind of stuff that they need to do i don't know if
[2979.88 --> 2984.78]  it's best for consumer interest but if i'm just thinking about this from a microsoft point of view
[2984.78 --> 2989.38]  this is the kind of stuff that they need to do they were they were early with the whole windows thing
[2989.38 --> 2994.64]  they were early and on the ball with technology back then then they tried for quite a while with
[2994.64 --> 2999.48]  different hardware stuff obviously xbox was quite successful but outside of that windows phone
[2999.48 --> 3005.48]  zune etc okay zune was amazing well the product may have been good but it just didn't catch on the
[3005.48 --> 3010.56]  marketplace or two different things so zune music software was sweet and the zune itself was
[3010.56 --> 3015.64]  amazing it just didn't it didn't they were just late to the party they were just late to the party
[3015.64 --> 3021.06]  because by the time zune like was like really you know people started reviewing it positively like oh
[3021.06 --> 3029.30]  ipod was already a thing so yeah yeah but yeah i wish i do really wish um that zune kind of took off
[3029.30 --> 3034.76]  but it didn't so i feel like everyone is pivoting their business a little bit these days like it feels
[3034.76 --> 3038.86]  like every large firm is doing it to some degree so it makes sense because a lot of the guys have been
[3038.86 --> 3044.54]  doing the same thing for a long time speaking of microsoft steam is dropping windows xp and vista
[3044.54 --> 3052.68]  support in 2019 uh this was posted by sc2 mitch on the forum again we always have one from him uh it's
[3052.68 --> 3058.70]  they they're starting on january 1st 2019 steam will officially stop supporting the windows xp and
[3058.70 --> 3064.50]  windows vista operating systems to pay respects this means that after that date the steam client will no
[3064.50 --> 3071.30]  longer run on those versions of windows i suspect it's just not getting updates
[3071.30 --> 3077.78]  they could lock out access to the steam they could because it's essentially a browser i don't know if
[3077.78 --> 3083.92]  they're going to but they could so the newest features in steam rely on an embedded version of
[3083.92 --> 3088.56]  google chrome which no longer functions on older versions of windows yeah so i don't think you'll get
[3088.56 --> 3094.32]  updates for the remainder of 2018 steam will continue to run and launch on windows xp and windows vista but
[3094.32 --> 3101.44]  other functionality in steam will be somewhat limited uh new features such as the steam chat will not be available
[3101.44 --> 3110.40]  i don't know if people running those systems will care so we'll see gmail uh can remind you to reply
[3110.40 --> 3116.58]  that's actually super cool as part of its new design gmail has started resurfacing old unanswered emails with a
[3116.58 --> 3122.48]  suggestion that you should reply by bumping the email uh thread to the top of your inbox gmail also breaks the
[3122.48 --> 3128.64]  chronological order of your inbox which is kind of poo but you can probably disable this gmail lets you disable all
[3128.64 --> 3135.22]  smart features there we go the very next note uh some users don't want smart categories important emails first and
[3135.22 --> 3143.68]  smart reply suggestions uh you can tick off the boxes suggest emails to reply to and suggest emails to follow up on if you
[3143.68 --> 3148.86]  don't want to see this orange text ever again i do want to see it personally so i'm going to leave that
[3148.86 --> 3155.04]  there this is me spitballing um i'm but i'm guessing they probably integrated like the um the priority
[3155.04 --> 3160.90]  feature you know like where it marks certain things so they use important because yeah because because
[3160.90 --> 3167.48]  you would hate you would hate you know for it to tell you to reply to an email hey walmart.com say
[3167.48 --> 3172.70]  sale you know save 50 on paper towels you know and you wouldn't want to get nags to reply to that but
[3172.70 --> 3179.40]  yeah so someone in chat said steam did a hardware survey a while back they probably saw it wasn't
[3179.40 --> 3185.66]  worthwhile to continue support yeah i recently checked it out because i was i was uh having a bad day and i
[3185.66 --> 3193.06]  was really frustrated with the fact that my uh stream deck from elgato didn't work on windows 8.1 and it
[3193.06 --> 3197.82]  would like it hurts my brain that that doesn't work and it's so confusing because it's actually a pretty
[3197.82 --> 3205.76]  sweet piece of tech um and like alternatives that actually do all of the same things uh are way more
[3205.76 --> 3212.60]  expensive in in most cases and alternatives that do almost the same thing well they don't they don't do
[3212.60 --> 3218.52]  quite the same thing like they'll do um yeah and it's not even that i need it i don't i could just use
[3218.52 --> 3223.82]  a midi controller but i like it's cool it's nice and small the buttons are all framed you can change
[3223.82 --> 3227.98]  what it shows on the screen it's a really cool device and it only works on windows 10 doesn't make
[3227.98 --> 3235.62]  any freaking sense to me and what drove me nuts was because people have hacked it and forced it to
[3235.62 --> 3241.48]  work on other operating systems by checking by just all they did in the one case was they took out the
[3241.48 --> 3249.50]  check that checks if you're on windows 10 and it just works it doesn't work anymore they they updated
[3249.50 --> 3253.64]  it and now it doesn't work but it did for a little while and i can't find what's the rationale to stop
[3253.64 --> 3262.08]  it from working on windows 8.1 i i haven't got what i think of as a satisfactory answer um i'm sure
[3262.08 --> 3266.30]  there's something what they've been saying is it's just too much to support but what drove me nuts about
[3266.30 --> 3271.96]  that was that just taking the flag out made it work but then technically they have updated it since
[3271.96 --> 3277.16]  then and it doesn't work anymore i doubt they forced that guy's hack to not work so they probably
[3277.16 --> 3282.46]  just used something that doesn't work on previous versions of windows and now it doesn't work it's
[3282.46 --> 3288.98]  just the thing that drives me nuts is i looked into the steam hardware survey and all the people not
[3288.98 --> 3296.38]  using windows 10 is a pretty huge market share and i can't imagine that it wouldn't be worth the dev work
[3296.38 --> 3303.18]  to have that available market share now something that they may have done in terms of market research
[3303.18 --> 3309.26]  is looking at well the people that aren't using windows 10 are they willing to buy it maybe they're
[3309.26 --> 3314.68]  not using windows 10 because they don't have the money to have a newer computer that's possible
[3314.68 --> 3321.34]  i don't see the merit in that but that could be what elgato's seeing i i wonder if it has to do
[3321.34 --> 3327.38]  anything with just some sort of cya kind of security thing where they're just saying oh well it's an
[3327.38 --> 3332.52]  older version of windows it's just kind of less secure by default and we don't want to be blamed
[3332.52 --> 3337.22]  if something goes wrong with our product because they're running like an old version of windows it
[3337.22 --> 3342.80]  could be as simple as that so who knows yeah um someone said it was free to upgrade yeah but some
[3342.80 --> 3351.72]  people with like i'm talking yeah some people no that's a good point i don't know i don't know what
[3351.72 --> 3359.00]  their reasoning is uh i i i can't understand it doesn't make any sense to me but anyways i was looking
[3359.00 --> 3364.10]  up steam hardware surveys to try to justify my rage because i really really really want this thing
[3364.10 --> 3370.24]  to work but i cannot use windows 10 because i will rip my eyes out um so anyways i can't use the
[3370.24 --> 3376.22]  freaking stream deck because i can't find the executable for the version that works uh with
[3376.22 --> 3383.52]  just the flag taken away i i can find i can github download the like hack that removes the flag that's
[3383.52 --> 3388.26]  fine i can't find the executable for the installer that works that way and i don't care about whatever
[3389.00 --> 3395.88]  they have it doesn't matter to me at all um so yeah anyways that's why i've seen yeah there's
[3395.88 --> 3400.34]  basically no one running xp and vista on steam anymore moral of the story there you go because
[3400.34 --> 3403.22]  i looked up the steam hardware surveys and yeah it's a it's a pretty small percentage
[3403.22 --> 3415.46]  someone in chat said windows 10 is 55.5 windows 7 is 33.57 windows 8.1 is only 4.07 yeah that's fine
[3415.46 --> 3424.18]  my thing is if they make it work for windows 7 which is 33.6 essentially percent of the audience
[3424.18 --> 3432.60]  which is a huge percentage uh it will work for 8.1 it will or it'll be one of those situations where we
[3432.60 --> 3436.88]  can just remove the flag of them saying that it won't work for 8.1 and it'll install just fine
[3436.88 --> 3441.68]  i'm not trying to say that everyone uses windows 8.1 i realize i'm in a very small category there but
[3441.68 --> 3448.00]  windows 7 is huge and i want to lean on that to be able to get support for older versions of windows
[3448.00 --> 3454.60]  that will essentially include windows 8.1 yeah because 7 to 8.1 compatibility is like very good
[3454.60 --> 3464.04]  um going two more is a little bit more of a stretch though so yeah yep yeah anyways that's it for the
[3464.04 --> 3468.90]  show oh is that it yeah i think so there's no other topics super smash brothers is going to have
[3468.90 --> 3476.18]  65 characters for switch is that not in here i'm looking right at it why did i not see it what other
[3476.18 --> 3481.12]  news did i miss that's basically it though okay yeah i must have just scrolled right over it yeah
[3481.12 --> 3487.68]  it's a bajillion characters i think they said every everyone who's ever fought in a smash game is in
[3487.68 --> 3496.24]  this game okay is it true though because i saw people talking about waluigi was waluigi ever in a smash
[3496.24 --> 3501.08]  game i don't know maybe he's a trophy i don't know if you could actually select him to fight though
[3501.08 --> 3501.60]  i forget
[3501.60 --> 3505.60]  whoa
[3505.60 --> 3513.88]  motherboardvice.com has a counterpoint f waluigi he doesn't deserve to be in the new smash bros that's
[3513.88 --> 3518.14]  a little aggressive guys yeah he's kind of an irritating character i think he might have a point
[3518.14 --> 3526.50]  oh my goodness it's uh yeah so everyone that's in super smash bros ultimate except for waluigi
[3526.50 --> 3533.74]  essentially waluigi missing from super smash bros ultimate i don't care someone might care
[3533.74 --> 3542.92]  maybe he was left out intentionally maybe maybe he'll be dlc could you imagine i could just imagine
[3542.92 --> 3548.80]  the storm that would happen if they had like the waluigi dlc yeah that would be really funny to see
[3548.80 --> 3554.84]  that'd be great yeah cost 60 bucks for one character uh so there there is a new uh score
[3554.84 --> 3560.26]  counter that pops up during one-on-one fights when anybody is ko'd uh each fighter has gotten some
[3560.26 --> 3565.20]  kind of graphical tweak to some degree which makes sense there's two new playable characters
[3565.20 --> 3572.72]  ridley the alien pterodactyl boss from the metroid series and inklings the squid kids from splatoon
[3572.72 --> 3578.20]  they were already in mario kart yeah just added them to smash now so i don't know if uh yeah
[3578.20 --> 3583.56]  anyways uh fighters must now choose their battleground stage before picking a character
[3583.56 --> 3588.52]  that's different it's always the other way around right yeah that's weird that actually makes sense
[3588.52 --> 3593.16]  it says due to professional players favoring certain stages for certain characters yeah okay that makes
[3593.16 --> 3600.30]  sense uh a picture in picture preview window when any combatant uh when any yeah when any combatant
[3600.30 --> 3605.94]  is launched off the screen that also makes sense to me um but yeah apparently it will launch on
[3605.94 --> 3611.98]  nintendo switch on december 7th 2018 cool just in time for christmas sounds like i'll be getting
[3611.98 --> 3617.04]  yet another game for my switch on december 7th 2018 they should have released it on black friday
[3617.04 --> 3623.48]  just to see the meltdown oh god i'm really happy they did just like just like the parking lot
[3623.48 --> 3631.00]  butt whoopings yeah yeah yeah i would love to see that hyrule fight club 24 7 pretty much hyrule castle
[3631.00 --> 3638.46]  is the is the is the only map for me boy um but uh yeah anyways that's actually it for wanshow
[3638.46 --> 3644.08]  that was probably loud sorry headphone users and we'll see you next week when your ears stop bleeding
[3644.08 --> 3655.60]  okay
[3655.60 --> 3656.70]  you
[3656.70 --> 3661.28]  you
[3661.28 --> 3670.28]  you
