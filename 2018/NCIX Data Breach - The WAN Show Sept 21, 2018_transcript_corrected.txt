[0.00 → 7.28] Hey, so we just streamed like 20 minutes of a show.
[7.54 → 9.02] The best 20 minutes ever.
[9.16 → 10.30] It was pretty great, actually.
[10.64 → 14.10] It was also to the test channel and not to the live channel.
[14.16 → 14.72] That's not you.
[14.80 → 15.70] It's the opposite of you guys.
[15.80 → 16.02] Yeah.
[16.42 → 16.72] So.
[17.12 → 18.06] So we're back.
[18.34 → 19.12] Hey, how's it going?
[19.20 → 23.46] We got a bunch of great news this week that we definitely haven't talked about before
[23.46 → 26.52] already in a different previous version of the show.
[26.52 → 28.04] Here's something I've never read before.
[28.04 → 30.34] NCI had a data breach.
[30.70 → 34.58] Some of the people we actually know in our lives are really affected by this.
[34.72 → 34.94] Yeah.
[35.32 → 35.68] Wow.
[35.68 → 36.40] Lots of people, actually.
[36.62 → 37.46] Even people that work here.
[37.60 → 43.70] Also, Amazon has new hardware, including like a microwave and a subwoofer and some weird,
[43.80 → 44.64] weird stuff.
[44.96 → 45.82] And guess what, China?
[46.16 → 49.88] Google's back, and they want you to search for stuff using their service.
[50.44 → 52.70] But this time they're ready to play by the government's rules.
[53.18 → 54.28] What will that mean?
[54.54 → 55.14] News at 11.
[55.14 → 62.34] Also, Vulcan 1.1.85 is releasing with ray tracing and video extensions, which is good,
[62.58 → 66.24] even if you don't like ray tracing, because that means that maybe there will be more Vulcan
[66.24 → 68.86] in the world, which is good for you and your friends.
[68.88 → 70.04] Live long and roll the intro.
[70.04 → 77.04] Live long and roll the intro.
[77.04 → 79.04] I know.
[79.04 → 81.04] Give the Twitch out of them?
[81.04 → 82.04] Yeah, yeah.
[82.04 → 83.04] Oh, who is it?
[83.04 → 84.04] Wait, what?
[84.04 → 86.34] Do you have the Twitch out of them?
[90.04 → 90.76] Yeah, yeah.
[93.04 → 93.94] Oh, oh.
[94.08 → 94.40] Squarespace.
[94.40 → 94.88] Who is it?
[95.14 → 95.22] What?
[95.46 → 95.72] Cinder.
[95.90 → 96.22] Squarespace.
[96.50 → 96.82] Squarespace.
[97.90 → 98.46] Marinas.
[98.68 → 99.68] Marinas.
[99.90 → 100.34] Energy.
[100.44 → 100.96] Energy.
[101.86 → 103.60] I did it in reverse order from last time.
[103.84 → 105.24] So we've done this before.
[106.02 → 107.22] We've done this already.
[107.56 → 108.50] This is Groundhog Day.
[109.50 → 110.44] Oh, awesome.
[110.52 → 113.82] So starting from the top, again, we've got the NCX data breach.
[114.26 → 115.90] I think this is pretty important to talk about.
[115.96 → 118.88] So we're just going to do the whole thing over again.
[118.88 → 121.74] This was originally posted by privacyfly.com.
[122.12 → 125.60] It's like the I think it's the only article on their site, but I could be totally wrong.
[126.38 → 130.38] But you'll see it in the description if you want to check it out, if you're watching the GOD.
[130.98 → 133.28] And it's quite the adventure.
[133.64 → 134.90] We're going to skim over a lot of it.
[134.90 → 139.30] But if you're even remotely interested, I would recommend checking out the original article and reading it.
[139.40 → 139.46] Yeah.
[139.50 → 148.34] Even if you're not, if it's the if it would be the first leak or security thing for which you actually read the detailed description.
[148.62 → 148.84] Yeah.
[149.04 → 149.52] It's a treat.
[149.72 → 151.08] This would be the first one to do it with.
[151.40 → 151.52] Yeah.
[151.56 → 151.72] Yeah.
[151.72 → 152.30] It's really cool.
[152.36 → 153.52] It's like, it's like a story.
[153.56 → 154.08] It's gripping.
[154.48 → 155.02] It is.
[155.12 → 155.36] Yeah.
[155.46 → 158.18] It's, it gets really deep into it.
[158.20 → 160.30] As you can see, it's like really written out.
[160.40 → 161.16] What happened here?
[161.24 → 163.14] It all starts on Craigslist naturally.
[163.14 → 163.70] Yeah.
[163.92 → 171.38] Travis Goering, hope I'm saying your last name correctly, sees two database servers from NCI for sale on Craigslist.
[171.52 → 174.66] Ask the guy if it still has the original data on it.
[175.46 → 180.54] Guy takes forever to respond, but does eventually respond with, yes, original data is intact.
[180.98 → 182.26] And it just goes from there.
[182.46 → 184.00] It's a pretty wild ride.
[184.52 → 185.48] The way it shows on.
[185.60 → 186.28] Hey, yeah.
[186.54 → 187.78] I just heard Luke talking.
[187.90 → 188.74] I was like, Luke's here.
[189.18 → 189.48] Yeah.
[189.60 → 191.12] We were streaming to the test channel.
[191.38 → 191.56] Oh.
[191.96 → 192.16] Yeah.
[192.16 → 193.88] That sucked for like a long time.
[194.34 → 198.44] There's apparently new instructions on how to run the WAN show and the instructions were behind everything.
[198.72 → 199.44] So it wasn't.
[199.48 → 200.60] Are you guys actually streaming now?
[200.60 → 201.58] We are actually streaming now.
[201.58 → 201.72] Oh.
[201.96 → 202.24] Yes.
[202.36 → 203.44] Glad I'm interrupting the show.
[203.48 → 203.96] Hi, everyone.
[204.16 → 204.86] Nick is saying hi.
[204.94 → 206.60] Nick is here, and he's happy that Luke's here.
[206.68 → 207.76] You guys are on both YouTube networks?
[208.06 → 208.30] Yeah.
[208.86 → 209.10] Sweet.
[209.42 → 213.30] Anyway, there was a lot of information in this leak.
[213.36 → 214.60] This is not a standard leak.
[214.60 → 220.82] Usually when you hear like, oh, website information leaked, there will be a set amount of user accounts or all user accounts.
[220.88 → 225.76] It's usually just the username and password that gets leaked, which is terrible to be clear.
[225.88 → 229.38] But this is like many, many, many levels beyond that.
[229.38 → 233.78] This was all your credit card information, all your payment information in general.
[233.88 → 241.86] So if you played with PayPal or something else, addresses, full names, passwords, all of it unencrypted, all of it in plain text.
[241.86 → 243.62] Are there some social insurance numbers?
[243.92 → 245.10] For employees, yes.
[245.64 → 247.86] For employees, there were social insurance numbers, T4s.
[249.00 → 249.60] Oh, that's right.
[249.66 → 258.18] Address data, like historically over time, all the employment information, which is usually pretty heavy in terms of like, I'm a steal your life, bro.
[258.86 → 260.86] All of that was available.
[261.90 → 262.64] Oh, God.
[263.12 → 264.00] So pretty oof.
[264.00 → 273.10] So the story there was that there was a warehouse that NCX had all their junk in, but they didn't own the warehouse.
[273.36 → 274.14] There were tenants there.
[274.44 → 279.04] So when they went bankrupt, their rent was overdue to the tune of $150,000.
[279.64 → 286.04] So in order to try to pay for it, they just said, just keep all the junk that we have in there.
[286.64 → 293.14] So then the landlord has all these servers and desktops, like hundreds of desktops, computers, and he's trying to sell them.
[293.14 → 299.62] So then this third party, this company comes in and says, well, that stuff's useful to us because of this project we're working on.
[300.00 → 302.40] So there's this guy named Jeff that works for that company.
[302.80 → 304.10] Jeff, that's all we really know.
[304.16 → 306.52] My name is Jeff, and he's brokering the deal.
[306.82 → 311.92] So he brokers the deal and gets this company what they want, but then he doesn't stop there.
[312.70 → 317.48] One more thing, I'm going to sell this data multiple times to multiple different people.
[317.72 → 319.18] Some of these people come from overseas.
[319.18 → 325.22] There's one individual who was supposed to come in December to pick up some of the hardware.
[325.74 → 326.88] The guy was from China.
[327.06 → 327.98] This is crazy.
[328.32 → 328.46] Yeah.
[328.74 → 334.54] There was actually a tweet that just happened earlier today from the RCMP, which is the police in Canada.
[335.14 → 337.52] And they said that they seize the hardware now.
[337.96 → 338.26] Really?
[338.58 → 338.82] Yeah.
[338.92 → 339.84] That was pretty fast.
[340.24 → 340.94] Not fast enough.
[341.12 → 341.38] Yeah.
[341.38 → 345.12] It's been sold like seven times for like 35 grand.
[345.58 → 346.56] Oh, it's gone.
[346.68 → 347.64] It's super gone.
[347.82 → 354.28] I'm just happy that once this article came out, which was like a day or two ago, they've already got everything.
[354.48 → 356.08] I love how the tweet doesn't specify.
[356.48 → 359.22] It's just like, yeah, there's a company you may have heard of.
[359.48 → 361.70] They're now defunct, but they're pretty well known.
[361.70 → 365.70] I said afternoon we opened an investigation into data.
[365.70 → 367.52] Some people listen, so we got to, yeah.
[367.94 → 374.34] We opened an investigation into data storage devices being sold online, allegedly containing, allegedly.
[375.74 → 376.84] You know, dude.
[377.12 → 381.80] Anyway, containing customer data from a defunct but well-known computer retailer.
[382.28 → 384.52] We have since recovered the storage devices.
[384.88 → 386.64] Our investigation is active and ongoing.
[386.64 → 399.36] So them recovering the storage devices, unfortunately, while I'm like, oh, I'm happy they did that, means effectively nothing because the data has been copied multiple times and resold.
[399.44 → 401.28] There's actually more places to buy it from now.
[401.56 → 401.92] Yes.
[402.46 → 405.48] And even the original guy was like, do you want to buy all the hardware?
[405.70 → 411.24] Because I have the important stuff backed up, and I'm reselling it anyway, so you can buy all the hardware.
[411.28 → 413.26] It was way cheaper to buy just the data.
[413.38 → 414.76] It was 15 grand instead of 35.
[415.14 → 415.38] Yeah.
[415.38 → 418.04] So the dude was like, well, no.
[419.62 → 422.74] So like, yeah, the seizing the hardware, like, good job, guys.
[422.88 → 425.38] And, you know, the allegedly having customer data.
[426.44 → 428.42] Good job on not being sure yet.
[428.64 → 432.38] But it's just so scary how much different this feels to me.
[433.00 → 434.96] You read about hacks like this all the time.
[435.12 → 437.80] Equifax was a big one in the States that affected many, many people.
[437.94 → 440.26] It didn't affect me, so I didn't really care that much.
[440.26 → 453.78] But when the screenshots have towns like Chilliwack, Coquitlam, Langley that are right around us, suddenly you're looking at the spreadsheet, tracing that line across from the town and finding a name.
[453.90 → 456.20] And you're like, oh, I might know the name that's right there.
[456.20 → 456.84] Yeah.
[456.84 → 456.90] Yeah.
[456.98 → 460.38] So here are some database snapshots.
[461.88 → 462.16] Yeah.
[462.16 → 468.98] The top one seems to be of an American database, and the second one seems to be of a Canadian database.
[470.86 → 475.30] So if someone bought this data, what could they do with it to screw you?
[476.20 → 477.32] They can do a lot.
[477.32 → 481.72] We're actually getting into a part of this that we didn't get into last time.
[481.78 → 486.54] But they could do actually a lot, especially with employees.
[486.86 → 492.68] So I'm going to jump back slightly and cover the different levels of data leak that had happened.
[492.80 → 500.12] So for customers, like I had already said, your full name, your address, your payment information, your password, all that kind of stuff, plain text.
[500.22 → 500.84] That's a lot.
[500.92 → 502.28] There's a lot they can do with that already.
[502.66 → 504.74] Now I'm going to jump to other people, however.
[504.74 → 510.20] As you can see up here, someone's T4 leaked.
[511.62 → 513.30] There's social security numbers.
[513.56 → 514.56] Is that the right one?
[514.72 → 516.12] I always get them confused because I have both.
[516.56 → 517.64] Social insurance number?
[517.72 → 518.32] Social insurance.
[518.40 → 518.88] Is that Canadian?
[519.00 → 519.16] Yeah.
[519.34 → 530.22] So your social insurance number, your residential history, because you have to update that with your employer all the time.
[530.22 → 538.56] Your first name, your last name, your middle name, like everything that an employer would need to legally employ you, which is a lot, leaked.
[538.96 → 540.60] So that's pretty bad.
[540.70 → 542.80] So let's go from the customer standpoint first.
[543.14 → 546.18] They could take credit out on your credit card.
[546.28 → 547.44] They could cash out your credit card.
[548.30 → 551.60] They could do those like terrible check things for your credit card.
[551.60 → 555.98] Now, would your – the information that leaked, it would have to be of a credit card that's still active?
[556.16 → 556.50] Yes.
[556.62 → 560.12] So I think that that is definitely a subset of the data.
[560.40 → 563.66] Yeah, because to be clear as well, this data goes back forever.
[564.16 → 566.00] But only as recent as 2017.
[566.50 → 567.60] Well, yeah, because they –
[567.60 → 568.00] But credit cards are –
[568.00 → 568.58] They went under.
[568.58 → 569.14] Three years.
[569.14 → 569.22] Three years.
[570.44 → 571.76] So if your credit card –
[571.76 → 574.26] Yes, but you could renew a credit card and keep the number.
[575.06 → 576.92] So you could have the same information.
[577.64 → 577.92] Yeah.
[578.08 → 579.06] Like I'm pretty – yeah.
[579.46 → 579.70] Yeah.
[579.90 → 582.30] I'm pretty sure there's one credit card that I have to null now.
[582.70 → 583.06] Dang.
[583.28 → 584.62] Which kind of sucks because –
[584.62 → 585.28] You like that one?
[585.60 → 587.86] Well, it's just – I've just been using it for a long time.
[587.86 → 592.50] So there's like some recurring billing on it that I'm going to have to kill and reset up.
[592.70 → 593.32] It's just annoying.
[594.78 → 596.96] But they don't have my more important ones.
[597.12 → 597.70] So ha ha ha.
[597.70 → 597.78] Yeah.
[598.50 → 599.78] But yeah, they could –
[599.78 → 600.34] Foiled again!
[601.38 → 603.78] They could mess with your credit if they already have that.
[604.02 → 610.26] If you paid with PayPal, they probably have your account information because your account –
[610.26 → 613.48] Most PayPal accounts that I know of are set up based on the email.
[613.84 → 618.88] And you would probably give them the email if you tried to pay through PayPal.
[620.62 → 626.76] If your password – if you have that – if you share that password elsewhere –
[626.76 → 627.42] Stuffing.
[628.30 → 629.18] That's what it's called, right?
[629.98 → 632.38] I've been watching that hair in your mouth forever.
[633.34 → 635.12] I tried to get rid of it like subtly.
[635.58 → 638.18] So Luke's talking, and I'm looking at him from the side.
[638.54 → 642.20] And the way the lighting is, I can totally see this long hair.
[642.24 → 643.02] I don't even know where it came from.
[643.14 → 643.46] Me neither.
[643.70 → 644.02] It's long.
[644.02 → 646.28] Honestly, Ivan filled this cup and I just took a drink.
[646.52 → 647.26] So I'm a little –
[647.26 → 649.36] There's this long hair sticking out of his mouth.
[649.86 → 654.28] And then he finishes his sentence and goes, and I can see it shoot it.
[656.28 → 657.14] Totally inhaled it.
[657.20 → 658.04] I was like, oh my god.
[659.62 → 659.94] Okay.
[660.00 → 660.24] Sorry.
[660.36 → 660.68] Keep going.
[660.68 → 662.00] I don't know what we were talking about.
[662.36 → 664.86] We were talking about a password.
[665.64 → 665.86] Oh, yeah.
[665.92 → 669.08] Stuffing is when, let's say, LinkedIn gets hacked.
[669.54 → 670.78] They take your password.
[671.28 → 675.58] Well, then you can just take that password and assume that someone uses the password in lots of different sites.
[675.58 → 678.40] And they just brute force it on lots of different sites so you can get hacked.
[678.80 → 681.68] So you stuff that password and username into everything, essentially.
[681.98 → 686.06] So just because LinkedIn got hacked doesn't mean it's the only target for you to get pwned.
[686.30 → 693.34] That's why you should have something like a password manager and have unique passwords for every single service and website or whatever that you use.
[694.34 → 697.22] But anyway, so password could be a vector for attack.
[697.42 → 700.54] They also have your full name and your address and stuff.
[700.54 → 709.56] So there could be some relatively minority, but there definitely could be some identity theft going on there.
[709.56 → 713.66] Like they send you flowers on Valentine's Day and just to screw with your relationship?
[713.76 → 715.46] Well, like if they have your full credit card number.
[715.46 → 716.12] Who are these from?
[718.52 → 719.00] John!
[720.18 → 725.88] If they have your full credit card number, your full address, and your full name,
[725.88 → 730.70] it's relatively easy to convince different institutions that you are that person.
[731.18 → 734.16] It's actually not that hard because of social engineering.
[734.90 → 744.82] It's surprisingly easy to convince people because most people working for a company don't want to do as much work.
[745.38 → 748.64] And it's more work to verify that you're the person that you say you are.
[748.64 → 750.56] Especially when you're like, oh, it's tight.
[751.04 → 756.38] They ask you what your address is, or they ask you certain information about yourself if you have that.
[756.62 → 761.38] And if you have the person's full name, if you have their address, and you have their credit card number,
[761.52 → 764.30] you can probably get a little bit of other information.
[764.94 → 770.04] And if you get a little bit of other information, and you use the right tone, and you assert yourself in the right way,
[770.10 → 773.82] you can often get access to additional things.
[773.82 → 781.70] Now, hopefully you get people who are as judicious as the people I've had in the past where they ask me for my postal code
[781.70 → 785.52] and I go, I don't know what it is.
[785.62 → 786.80] And they're like, well, sorry.
[786.96 → 789.56] And I'm like, you realize I can Google it.
[789.66 → 797.02] You can go online and just Canada Post has a service, or you just type in an address, any address at all,
[797.04 → 798.04] and it gives you the postal code.
[798.04 → 803.86] But I'm like, if I'm trying to pwn James Strive right now, and I don't actually have his postal code on hand,
[803.94 → 804.46] like this isn't.
[804.46 → 805.42] It's really easy to find.
[805.86 → 807.60] Social engineering is like a big deal.
[808.06 → 812.08] And this would give someone an insane amount of ammo for social engineering.
[812.08 → 818.54] Now, beyond that, if you know anyone who worked for NCX, this is where it gets really bad
[818.54 → 822.06] because they have their social insurance, social insurance number.
[822.20 → 823.42] I keep on forgetting which ones which.
[823.42 → 833.00] Having their sin is really brutal because basically no one has other people's sin numbers.
[833.50 → 840.72] So in terms of pulling identity theft stuff, they have a major vector to screw with you at this point,
[841.12 → 846.60] especially if they have your residential history and your sin.
[846.60 → 853.80] Because as far as I know, those two things combined is like what you need to get your birth certificate reprinted.
[854.28 → 858.18] And if they get your birth certificate, they can get pretty much any other government ID.
[858.90 → 860.26] So they can get driver's licenses.
[860.40 → 861.04] They can get whatever.
[861.04 → 862.66] And at that point, you're screwed.
[862.86 → 863.26] It's over.
[863.66 → 864.16] You're done.
[864.16 → 874.84] Even if they don't have all that and all they have is like the name of an institution that you use and your address,
[875.78 → 877.84] they already are your email address.
[878.02 → 880.54] They can already make convincing phishing attacks.
[880.54 → 880.96] Oh, yeah.
[881.06 → 883.94] Which are enough to pwn most people, including politicians.
[884.40 → 884.54] Yeah.
[885.30 → 887.10] So this is very bad.
[887.10 → 892.88] And I guess the original root question, I think, was what can you do to protect yourself?
[893.44 → 895.62] It wasn't, but that's next.
[895.64 → 896.58] I thought it was, but sure.
[896.78 → 896.96] Okay.
[897.08 → 898.70] There's not much left, so we'll go there.
[899.74 → 902.78] If you're a standard user, let's go back from that.
[902.84 → 905.24] If you just purchased things from NCI, update your passwords.
[905.36 → 908.30] Make sure there's no other password that shared this password.
[909.14 → 910.52] Cancel any credit card.
[910.54 → 913.10] You mean the password that you used at like an NCI website?
[913.96 → 914.34] Yeah, yeah.
[914.34 → 916.86] Most people, as far as I know, were online shoppers.
[917.26 → 918.48] So, yeah.
[918.58 → 925.54] Make sure that you change your other passwords if you had other passwords that shared a password with NCIX.com.
[925.82 → 931.34] But seriously, in this day and age, you need to make sure you're not sharing passwords across websites.
[931.48 → 932.56] This kind of stuff happens all the time.
[932.66 → 933.34] Get on top of it.
[933.70 → 935.24] It's too late at this point.
[935.34 → 935.82] Figure it out.
[937.60 → 941.72] Outside of that, cancel any credit cards that you may have even possibly used there.
[942.18 → 945.66] As far as I know, you can't like to check what one you had.
[945.66 → 947.22] Well, this is my other question.
[947.40 → 951.34] Is there a way to figure out whether you were leaked?
[951.76 → 951.86] Right.
[951.98 → 952.20] No.
[952.84 → 953.94] As of right now, no.
[954.36 → 958.18] This Privacy Fly guy, I don't know if he ended up actually buying the data set or not.
[958.62 → 961.62] It says that they like made an agreement to buy it.
[961.82 → 963.56] And then he like walked out of the building.
[963.70 → 965.18] And then that's the end of the story.
[966.36 → 967.12] Spoilers, dude.
[967.72 → 968.12] Jeez.
[968.12 → 968.56] Sorry.
[970.10 → 970.94] That's a good point.
[972.48 → 973.54] Well, it's an interesting story.
[973.58 → 974.44] I would want to read it.
[975.46 → 977.24] So I don't know if he has it.
[978.08 → 980.98] Other people do have it, but it hasn't leaked publicly.
[981.48 → 985.66] Like there isn't a website out there with all of this stuff publicly on it.
[985.80 → 988.50] So there's no way to check specifically if you are in there.
[988.50 → 994.36] But like if you've ever bought something from NCI or if you ever worked with NCI, you're in there.
[994.62 → 1000.90] So do you think now that the RCMP have it that they will maybe release a list of names of people who got pwned?
[1003.58 → 1005.12] I wouldn't trust it anyway.
[1006.76 → 1011.54] If you've ever – it seems like a fairly easy set of like if statements.
[1012.16 → 1013.36] Have you ever worked there?
[1013.58 → 1013.92] No.
[1014.20 → 1016.42] Have you ever bought anything from there ever?
[1016.42 → 1017.26] Or yes.
[1017.56 → 1017.84] Well.
[1018.80 → 1020.12] I'm like racking my brain.
[1020.40 → 1024.46] I know – I think I may have bought one from a physical location.
[1024.62 → 1026.68] I think I may have bought like an HDMI cable once.
[1028.48 → 1033.38] But then I kind of think I bought it with a company credit card like I was doing it for my other job.
[1034.30 → 1035.50] I don't know.
[1036.12 → 1038.82] I would be safe at a minimum.
[1039.20 → 1041.10] If you're an employee – like yeah.
[1041.10 → 1044.54] So if you're a customer, change whatever passwords that might be the same.
[1045.02 → 1046.24] Cancel your old credit card.
[1047.14 → 1048.90] Get a new credit card and forget about it.
[1050.22 → 1052.04] You'll be okay for the most part.
[1052.38 → 1057.20] You might get like – there might be people trying to do a minor identity theft to you.
[1057.30 → 1061.86] But that's going to be basically a constant – that's just a thing with the internet these days.
[1061.86 → 1068.72] And there's probably no information in there that couldn't be found if someone cared enough anyway.
[1068.72 → 1080.00] So I would be like a little bit of heightened awareness over the next little while if you receive any emails about like your password has been reset on some website or something.
[1080.00 → 1082.64] Like, you know, have some heightened awareness for a bit.
[1082.78 → 1084.50] But other than that, you should be okay.
[1084.50 → 1091.06] If you're an employee, I'm not versed enough in this stuff to properly tell you what to do.
[1091.18 → 1092.48] You need to look into it yourself.
[1092.88 → 1100.46] But a couple of things that you can do is obviously change all your credit card stuff because you probably bought stuff from the store.
[1100.46 → 1106.34] And two, I believe in Canada you can get your sin changed.
[1107.06 → 1108.02] I'm not sure.
[1108.02 → 1118.84] I do know you can get a credit freeze, which like freezes your credit for about a year I think is the average time that they do this for.
[1119.52 → 1127.16] And you would still be able to – like if you wanted to go buy a house or a car or something like that, and you needed credit, you would still be able to go get it.
[1127.62 → 1132.24] But like low-level credit application stuff is going to be frozen for a year.
[1134.26 → 1135.46] Sin change is a rough go.
[1135.66 → 1136.90] Sin change is a very rough go.
[1136.90 → 1139.84] You're going to be waiting in line in those buildings that you don't like going to.
[1140.08 → 1141.36] Yeah, for a long time.
[1141.42 → 1145.66] You're going to show up there and finally get to the front line, and they're going to say, oh, you didn't bring the right ID.
[1146.10 → 1149.12] You're going to have to go back, take more time off work, do it again.
[1149.88 → 1152.16] But you might want to anyway, to be completely honest.
[1152.62 → 1156.74] I need to do some more research, but I think they might not have mine because I think I was a contractor.
[1157.66 → 1162.02] And I think my contracting agreement thing was through like a –
[1162.02 → 1162.36] No leaks.
[1162.46 → 1163.24] It's in the contract.
[1163.24 → 1165.92] Well, no, like I think it's –
[1165.92 → 1174.56] Like my fake little company name thing, which is legal because I didn't make enough money because they underpaid me to an almost criminal level.
[1174.96 → 1178.28] Actually to just – yeah, anyway, that's a different conversation.
[1179.48 → 1183.66] Like that might leak, but it's not even a real company and there's nothing to look up there.
[1183.66 → 1190.84] Yeah, like I think I'm mostly okay, but like –
[1190.84 → 1191.30] Riley's dead.
[1192.10 → 1193.82] He's – we buried him this morning.
[1193.92 → 1197.62] Riley, Linus, Ivan, a few other people that I know are –
[1197.62 → 1198.68] Linus already left the country.
[1199.34 → 1200.52] Just – hoof!
[1201.26 → 1204.62] There's going to be work for them in terms of covering themselves from this.
[1204.70 → 1206.70] This is like really, really brutal.
[1206.70 → 1212.56] So, it's – yeah, but with that, let's finally talk about other news.
[1212.64 → 1213.86] It's keynote season, baby.
[1214.02 → 1214.34] Yeah.
[1214.88 → 1215.84] Apple stuff.
[1216.36 → 1217.40] Amazon stuff.
[1217.88 → 1218.42] Let's talk about this Amazon stuff.
[1218.42 → 1219.54] The Google event's coming up.
[1219.86 → 1220.72] That's my favourite one.
[1221.86 → 1225.26] Well, I'm hoping – I'm hoping the Pixel 3 is sweet because I need a new phone.
[1225.50 → 1227.58] This is my Pixel 1 XL.
[1227.84 → 1228.10] Ooh.
[1228.66 → 1230.58] I want the mini Pixel.
[1231.10 → 1231.98] The non-XL.
[1232.10 → 1232.28] Yeah.
[1232.72 → 1233.24] I want it.
[1233.56 → 1234.78] This is an S9+.
[1234.78 → 1237.92] It's beautiful, but it's 2+.
[1237.92 → 1242.46] I do a lot of one-handed, and I just want a smaller one.
[1242.56 → 1245.76] And I want to be able to put my phone in the front pocket of my jeans again.
[1245.86 → 1247.88] So, when the chat said stop giving clues to the hackers.
[1251.64 → 1252.76] They're way ahead of us.
[1253.48 → 1254.50] They're way ahead of us.
[1254.96 → 1258.92] That's not – and if those are clues, like, holy crap.
[1258.94 → 1259.44] What are you talking about?
[1259.44 → 1259.82] The Pixel?
[1260.20 → 1261.02] Oh, he's got a Pixel.
[1261.02 → 1263.26] I think he's talking about –
[1263.26 → 1265.02] Yeah, the people, the names.
[1265.28 → 1265.92] The NCI stuff.
[1266.12 → 1266.36] Yeah.
[1266.46 → 1267.04] It's all over.
[1267.12 → 1267.76] It's known already.
[1268.08 → 1269.44] They absolutely know.
[1269.68 → 1272.56] Can you imagine there's someone watching this stream and be like, wait a second?
[1272.56 → 1273.16] No way!
[1273.52 → 1274.86] Linus worked at NCI?
[1275.22 → 1275.70] Hold my beer.
[1276.38 → 1276.78] What?
[1279.18 → 1280.02] My God.
[1280.30 → 1281.74] Or, like, what they could do with the data.
[1281.88 → 1286.42] Dude, if they're going to spend, like, $15,000 plus on some data, they're probably going to
[1286.42 → 1287.26] know what to do with it.
[1287.36 → 1289.10] And they've probably done that kind of stuff in the past.
[1289.10 → 1290.98] We said we're moving on, damn it.
[1291.36 → 1296.90] So, the point was, Amazon somehow snuck up and had a hardware event that was a bit of
[1296.90 → 1297.34] a surprise.
[1297.48 → 1300.48] There were, like, some leaks, but caught most people off guard.
[1300.82 → 1305.98] And what I love about their approach to hardware is its just a total shotgun blast.
[1306.12 → 1306.30] Yeah.
[1306.42 → 1312.22] They don't – it's like there's a spectrum of we care a lot and try not to release junk.
[1313.04 → 1314.74] That's Apple on that one end.
[1314.74 → 1317.18] That's why I put the word try in there.
[1317.72 → 1320.24] And then somewhere – and then further along down, you've got Google.
[1320.38 → 1321.84] It's like, yeah, they care a lot.
[1321.92 → 1326.14] And then on the other end, you've probably got, like, Xiaomi.
[1327.62 → 1330.02] Xiaomi and Amazon.
[1330.26 → 1332.40] Amazon's like, we're just trying junk.
[1332.60 → 1334.40] We're just going to put a screen on this one.
[1335.18 → 1337.18] This one's going to have a big subwoofer on it.
[1337.34 → 1339.30] They released, like, 10 different new things.
[1339.72 → 1341.94] And what I think is cool is that they're –
[1341.94 → 1342.40] What the heck?
[1342.48 → 1343.40] They're like guinea pigs.
[1345.18 → 1349.66] Like, because then a year later, Google will release, like, a copycat version of one of these.
[1349.78 → 1349.98] Yeah.
[1350.10 → 1352.42] So let's just go through some of the stuff.
[1352.48 → 1353.66] It starts off pretty tame.
[1354.16 → 1358.16] You start off with some Echo Dots, which is just, like, a tiny Echo.
[1358.56 → 1359.64] No, Echo Dots old, though.
[1359.82 → 1361.36] Well, there are a couple of things that they upgraded.
[1361.36 → 1364.10] It looks like, yeah, maybe upgraded versions or newer versions.
[1364.42 → 1366.84] But then immediately you get into, like, what the heck?
[1367.48 → 1367.96] The –
[1367.96 → 1368.80] Echo Auto.
[1368.80 → 1373.04] Echo Auto, an in-car accessory that allows you to integrate Alexa into your car.
[1373.62 → 1374.48] So here's the weird thing.
[1374.56 → 1375.90] You can plug it in two different ways.
[1375.98 → 1383.26] You can plug it in with a 3.5 millimetre aux jack or by connecting over a smartphone's existing Bluetooth setup to the car.
[1383.38 → 1387.56] But you cannot just directly Bluetooth the device to the car.
[1389.00 → 1389.68] I don't know.
[1390.04 → 1390.44] Okay.
[1390.86 → 1391.24] All right.
[1391.74 → 1393.58] Apparently there's a slight catch.
[1393.80 → 1397.04] It's not ready, and it's only available by invitation.
[1397.04 → 1398.58] Well, yeah.
[1398.72 → 1402.24] The different items on this list have kind of a staggered rollout.
[1402.32 → 1403.62] Some things you can preorder right now.
[1403.70 → 1405.44] Some things you can't even preorder yet.
[1405.44 → 1414.84] But this Auto one, it gets powered by a cigarette lighter, like one of those cigarette lighter adapters that goes into, like, a mini USB.
[1415.36 → 1417.66] So you've got that one cord for sure.
[1418.08 → 1422.02] And then you also have to either do the Bluetooth through a phone.
[1422.02 → 1426.26] But if you don't do that, you've got the 3.5 millimetre jack.
[1426.34 → 1429.62] So then that's possibly two cords coming out of this thing and into your car.
[1429.74 → 1433.62] But if it's, okay, if it's, how does it bridge onto the Bluetooth through your phone?
[1433.70 → 1435.26] Because Bluetooth can only connect to one thing.
[1435.44 → 1435.68] Yeah.
[1436.10 → 1436.74] I don't know.
[1437.44 → 1438.10] It's weird.
[1438.94 → 1441.50] And then it's just Alexa capability in the car.
[1441.50 → 1447.74] Like, it's, you're paying 50 bucks because you really can't talk to Alexa for, like.
[1448.58 → 1449.46] You're just driving to work.
[1449.52 → 1449.82] You know what?
[1449.86 → 1451.34] I need more toilet paper.
[1451.86 → 1452.26] Now.
[1453.06 → 1454.24] Like, this second.
[1454.24 → 1455.90] All my best thinking is done in the car.
[1456.46 → 1456.68] Oh, man.
[1456.68 → 1456.84] All right.
[1456.88 → 1457.40] Let's not dwell.
[1457.48 → 1458.80] We've got, like, nine things to go with here.
[1459.00 → 1460.14] Amazon Echo Sub.
[1460.14 → 1467.50] If you've got a lot of different Echo devices in your house, and you have them hooked up in, like, a multi-room speaker array.
[1467.90 → 1471.20] Well, it's time you had a six-inch 100-watt subwoofer to go with those.
[1472.36 → 1473.96] So, this is a sub you got.
[1473.96 → 1474.14] Sorry.
[1474.20 → 1474.66] Hold on.
[1474.86 → 1477.80] There's a super chat thing, which, sorry, guys.
[1477.82 → 1478.82] I'm not going to read all these.
[1479.22 → 1479.74] Hold the phone.
[1479.86 → 1482.56] What's the difference between Tech Linked and Tech Quickie?
[1482.66 → 1483.58] They seem the same.
[1483.70 → 1484.42] Why have both?
[1485.48 → 1486.88] Have you even watched them?
[1486.88 → 1491.64] Thank you for your $5 donation.
[1492.12 → 1494.48] One has an orange and blue background.
[1494.62 → 1494.88] Yeah.
[1494.90 → 1496.32] The other has a white background.
[1496.50 → 1497.54] It's so different.
[1498.28 → 1499.70] Like, seriously, guys.
[1499.78 → 1505.20] One is a daily news show where they look at the news of that day and report on it in a quick fashion.
[1505.44 → 1506.56] That's Tech Linked.
[1506.96 → 1507.04] Yeah.
[1507.08 → 1508.70] And then one is a video of explainers.
[1508.70 → 1517.28] These videos tend to be more evergreen in that you might look up the definition of HDMI today or three years from now.
[1517.52 → 1520.88] That content, it's kind of like an encyclopedia of tech definitions.
[1520.88 → 1541.48] The idea behind Tech Quickie originally was Linus and I were talking about how, like, our mom or a friend or someone might be in a store or be shopping for something and see a name of something like HDMI or Core i7 and be like, I don't know what that means.
[1541.62 → 1543.12] I don't know what value this brings to me.
[1543.24 → 1548.12] And we wanted to make more or less a repository of information on those types of things.
[1548.12 → 1552.64] That's why a lot of the original videos were as basic as what is HDMI.
[1553.32 → 1558.80] And it's gotten into a little bit higher level topics over time because you run out of those things pretty quick.
[1559.44 → 1560.84] But it's explainers.
[1561.02 → 1565.08] If you ever ask yourself kind of tech question of, like, how does this work?
[1565.18 → 1566.12] Why can't I use that?
[1566.32 → 1568.56] Why can't I use my phone when I'm on the airplane?
[1568.82 → 1569.04] Yeah.
[1569.30 → 1570.30] That kind of stuff.
[1570.34 → 1571.64] As long as it's in the tech realm.
[1572.24 → 1573.54] Then Tech Quickie might have it.
[1573.72 → 1575.36] Then Tech Linked is daily news.
[1575.36 → 1580.34] They're, like, really, really wildly different.
[1581.34 → 1582.74] Thank you for your super chat, though.
[1582.94 → 1584.26] And please subscribe to everything.
[1584.64 → 1584.86] Yeah.
[1585.34 → 1586.02] Let's continue.
[1586.42 → 1588.22] So we have the Echo Sub.
[1588.58 → 1590.18] It's $130 for one.
[1590.26 → 1590.96] That's quite a lot.
[1591.52 → 1592.10] That's a lot.
[1592.26 → 1592.76] That's a lot.
[1592.82 → 1593.94] And it's a six-inch sub.
[1594.06 → 1595.16] It's, like, it's going to be this big.
[1595.56 → 1595.84] Yeah.
[1596.62 → 1597.26] That's a lot.
[1598.32 → 1600.18] And you have to pair it with other Echo things.
[1600.18 → 1602.44] So I don't know.
[1602.82 → 1604.82] Does that mean you can talk to it?
[1604.88 → 1606.22] Like, does it have a microphone array?
[1606.46 → 1606.48] I think so.
[1606.74 → 1607.22] I think so.
[1607.42 → 1608.22] And all that?
[1608.48 → 1608.64] Yeah.
[1608.64 → 1611.26] And if it talks back, is it just, like, hello?
[1611.66 → 1611.98] Oh, hey.
[1613.14 → 1614.26] Right away, Luke.
[1617.08 → 1620.64] They should have, like, the only voice that can speak through it should be, like, Morgan Freeman.
[1621.06 → 1622.82] Or, like, Earl Jones.
[1623.02 → 1623.36] Yeah.
[1623.76 → 1624.12] Yeah.
[1624.28 → 1624.46] Yeah.
[1624.50 → 1624.68] Yeah.
[1625.10 → 1626.28] I am the subwoofer.
[1626.28 → 1629.78] There's other sound companion things.
[1629.92 → 1634.22] Because there's the Echo Link app, the Echo Sub, and the Echo Input.
[1634.48 → 1636.12] The Echo Link amp.
[1636.58 → 1638.06] That thing is sweet, actually.
[1638.48 → 1646.66] If I'm in the Google ecosystem, mostly because the Amazon stuff comes to Canada way later and whatever.
[1646.96 → 1647.10] Yeah.
[1647.74 → 1648.74] That's probably the one I'd want.
[1648.74 → 1649.46] I would want that.
[1649.52 → 1654.94] Because you can, as far as I can assume, is you can still plug in all your own speakers and stuff.
[1655.02 → 1655.34] That's right.
[1655.34 → 1660.18] So, for me, I have ancient, like, from the 90s, Kitsch Tower speakers.
[1660.18 → 1660.76] Probably great.
[1661.24 → 1661.84] Yeah, they're wicked.
[1662.02 → 1662.22] Yeah.
[1662.32 → 1668.14] And I wanted to have a cool-looking amp for them to go in because I had a JVC one that I got for Christmas as a kid.
[1668.24 → 1669.90] And it had lots of buttons on it.
[1670.04 → 1670.74] And it had, like, a...
[1670.74 → 1671.36] What is going on?
[1671.66 → 1672.70] Whose hair is this?
[1672.86 → 1673.78] I don't know.
[1674.88 → 1681.68] I wanted a more stylish amp for my, you know, the shelf in the living room that's all hip-looking.
[1681.90 → 1682.06] Yeah.
[1682.06 → 1684.90] But there's just too many knobs and shit, and it doesn't look nice.
[1685.14 → 1686.90] So, then I ended up having to go to, like...
[1686.90 → 1687.88] I went online.
[1687.94 → 1689.52] I was like, can I get, like, a...
[1689.52 → 1690.42] You know the old look?
[1690.56 → 1696.22] The vintage look where they were just aluminum, just polished, and there's just one nice big knob, and that's about it?
[1696.64 → 1697.60] Who doesn't want that?
[1697.60 → 1703.78] And so, I ended up having to go to a vintage store of, like, refurbished stuff in order to get one because there's just no...
[1703.78 → 1707.32] I couldn't find any new stuff that had that kind of aesthetic.
[1708.10 → 1709.14] This kind of does.
[1709.34 → 1709.62] Kind of.
[1709.64 → 1710.16] It's black.
[1710.24 → 1712.50] It's not silver, but it's black, and it's spotless.
[1713.16 → 1714.62] The LEDs that it does have are just white.
[1715.40 → 1715.60] Yeah.
[1715.60 → 1720.44] It's kind of, like, the only weird thing about it is that it is just...
[1720.44 → 1721.82] One single knob?
[1721.94 → 1722.76] A big knob.
[1723.76 → 1726.94] Because usually they would be, like, wider and more boxy.
[1727.08 → 1730.98] This one has some curves to it, and it's just the knob instead of all the other inputs and buttons.
[1731.08 → 1731.94] But it's still metal.
[1732.28 → 1733.62] But it does, yeah.
[1733.64 → 1734.20] It's clean-looking.
[1734.30 → 1734.68] It's not a huge...
[1734.68 → 1740.06] You can plug your old speakers into it, and you've got, basically, this smart speaker setup.
[1740.06 → 1743.56] You've got all the Alexa abilities on your awesome older speakers.
[1743.56 → 1744.68] So that's cool.
[1745.00 → 1745.08] Yeah.
[1745.78 → 1747.14] And then they've got this...
[1747.14 → 1747.80] What is the input?
[1747.92 → 1748.34] Okay.
[1748.46 → 1751.12] So the input is basically an Echo Dot with no speaker.
[1752.22 → 1754.62] So the Echo Dot is like the Google Home Mini.
[1754.90 → 1756.06] It's tiny.
[1756.18 → 1757.16] It's like the size of a puck.
[1757.36 → 1758.76] It's got a speaker that sucks.
[1759.00 → 1759.86] You can talk to it.
[1759.88 → 1760.52] It answers you.
[1760.86 → 1761.72] It's 50 bucks.
[1761.90 → 1764.80] This new one is $15 cheaper.
[1765.10 → 1765.94] Get rid of the speaker.
[1766.40 → 1772.10] You've just got this microphone puck that you plug into an existing speaker and piggyback off of that.
[1772.10 → 1773.76] Which is cool.
[1774.26 → 1775.70] What I actually really want...
[1775.70 → 1777.34] So the...
[1777.34 → 1782.24] This thing is the Echo Link or the Echo Link Amp.
[1782.42 → 1783.24] It's two versions?
[1783.50 → 1785.14] Which are physically the same thing.
[1785.28 → 1788.92] I'm guessing one of them is just not actually an amplifier, and the other one is.
[1789.74 → 1790.18] I'm assuming.
[1790.54 → 1796.14] Because the Echo Link Amp is the same thing as the Echo Link, but with a 60-watt stereo amplifier inside.
[1796.38 → 1797.76] So the other one doesn't have that.
[1797.76 → 1801.30] And even when it doesn't have the amplifier, it's 200 bucks.
[1801.46 → 1802.54] And with the amp, it's three?
[1802.98 → 1803.90] 300 bucks.
[1804.38 → 1804.56] Yeah.
[1804.88 → 1805.58] Some of these are...
[1805.58 → 1808.78] Man, some of these devices are serious investments.
[1808.96 → 1810.28] Like the Google Home Max.
[1810.60 → 1812.02] Isn't that like an Xbox?
[1813.18 → 1813.60] Yeah.
[1814.72 → 1815.66] Holy crap.
[1816.76 → 1817.74] Sorry to cut you off.
[1817.78 → 1819.58] Yeah, but the Google Home Max is like 500 bucks.
[1820.10 → 1820.50] Wow.
[1821.18 → 1821.58] Wow.
[1821.92 → 1822.32] Wow.
[1822.72 → 1823.30] It's crazy.
[1823.30 → 1823.98] It's just so expensive.
[1823.98 → 1825.36] Like you can get a good speaker.
[1825.56 → 1828.62] Like the Google Home Max is a good speaker, but you can get some good speakers for that.
[1828.76 → 1829.46] It's crazy.
[1829.90 → 1831.56] And the input is 35.
[1832.00 → 1833.22] Like where is this delta?
[1833.72 → 1834.52] It's so weird.
[1835.40 → 1838.46] What I really want is something even more slimmed down than the input.
[1839.00 → 1841.08] I want just a microphone.
[1842.12 → 1847.88] Seriously, I'm in my house, and in my house, the Google Home can hear me anywhere.
[1847.88 → 1850.06] If it's in the middle of the night, I can be in my bed and whisper.
[1850.70 → 1851.02] Hey.
[1851.52 → 1851.72] Hey.
[1851.72 → 1852.42] It'll be boohoo.
[1853.60 → 1854.30] It can.
[1854.44 → 1858.36] But if I'm a foot away from it with music on, hey.
[1858.64 → 1858.92] Yeah.
[1859.10 → 1859.22] Yeah.
[1861.06 → 1865.40] So I wanted to just have like the smallest possible form factor, just a little microphone
[1865.40 → 1869.20] that I can just be like Nixon and just hide them around my house.
[1871.16 → 1871.84] That's funny.
[1872.90 → 1878.64] Amazon Fire TV Recast, a DVR box that can store TV shows and movies for viewing at home
[1878.64 → 1879.42] or on the go.
[1879.78 → 1882.56] Will release on November 14th and start at $230.
[1883.36 → 1883.72] Wow.
[1884.08 → 1885.20] Why are they all so expensive?
[1885.38 → 1887.04] I can't even see that in here, by the way.
[1887.12 → 1890.18] I don't think that's in this article, but I believe it.
[1890.62 → 1891.22] That's crazy.
[1891.40 → 1892.88] Some of these have funny names, too.
[1893.98 → 1895.50] Ring Stick Up Camera.
[1895.50 → 1898.34] They bought Ring.
[1898.46 → 1901.00] Ring is a home security company that does like those.
[1901.00 → 1901.04] Oh, okay.
[1901.04 → 1901.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1901.54 → 1904.06] Your doorbell that goes to your phone and you can.
[1904.36 → 1906.76] This is a security camera, so you can look through it.
[1906.78 → 1907.78] You can talk to people through it.
[1907.84 → 1909.94] You can make a siren noise if you want all through your phone.
[1909.94 → 1914.04] And $180 for one of those cameras.
[1914.34 → 1918.26] The Ring Stick Up Camera is set to release on October 18th, lets you see, hear, and speak
[1918.26 → 1919.74] to people from your tablet, phone, PC.
[1920.26 → 1921.28] Here's another one with a funny name.
[1921.34 → 1922.32] Amazon Smart Plug.
[1922.96 → 1923.60] That's me.
[1925.12 → 1930.36] Adds voice control to anything plugged in and will cost $25 when released on October 11th.
[1930.38 → 1933.16] So you plug it into your wall.
[1933.24 → 1936.20] You plug another thing into it, like a dumb thing.
[1936.36 → 1936.64] Yeah.
[1937.02 → 1938.98] Like a lamp that doesn't have a Philips Hue in it.
[1938.98 → 1939.60] Yeah, yeah.
[1940.16 → 1941.32] And then you can just turn it off.
[1941.42 → 1942.40] And you can do schedules too.
[1942.50 → 1946.74] So you can hook up a bunch of crap like that into it and then say, after 6 o'clock, turn
[1946.74 → 1947.04] off.
[1947.36 → 1951.22] Or you can be at work and be like, oh, I left that on, so I'm going to shut it off remotely.
[1951.96 → 1957.00] They released an analog wall clock with Echo.
[1958.16 → 1958.74] So, yeah.
[1958.86 → 1959.48] So what that thing.
[1959.96 → 1960.40] I know.
[1962.32 → 1963.62] This is what I like about them.
[1963.68 → 1964.74] They're just like, why not?
[1965.00 → 1967.56] This is the most shotgun approach I've ever seen.
[1967.56 → 1968.00] It's the best.
[1968.00 → 1973.78] It's $30, and it basically is a visualization tool for the timers that you set.
[1974.42 → 1979.32] So one of the most useful things on any of these assistants is, hey, set a timer for
[1979.32 → 1979.96] 30 minutes.
[1980.06 → 1980.28] Yeah.
[1980.50 → 1985.04] And what I usually do is I say, hey, how much time left on the timer?
[1985.26 → 1986.76] And it'll be 18 minutes left.
[1986.86 → 1988.24] With this, you don't need to ask again.
[1988.30 → 1991.38] You can just glance up and the clock is like a countdown.
[1991.80 → 1993.90] You can look at your analog wall clock that you'd now have again.
[1993.90 → 1997.80] Like those clocks at the swimming pool that have like all the different arrows until your lap time.
[1997.90 → 1997.98] Yeah.
[1998.04 → 2000.84] It just gives you a visual countdown, I guess.
[2001.08 → 2003.56] It's a smart looking smart clock.
[2003.86 → 2005.14] Would you buy a smart clock?
[2005.86 → 2006.64] Hell no.
[2007.00 → 2007.24] Yeah.
[2007.64 → 2008.52] He said no.
[2008.54 → 2009.10] I didn't think so.
[2009.10 → 2011.30] I wouldn't buy a microwave with Alexa either.
[2011.30 → 2011.56] Okay.
[2011.70 → 2012.74] Speaking of which.
[2012.88 → 2013.58] The microwave.
[2013.72 → 2016.46] The Alexa enabled microwave is actually the best thing.
[2016.96 → 2017.34] I think.
[2017.58 → 2018.54] Sell me on it, James.
[2018.72 → 2018.86] Okay.
[2019.08 → 2019.32] Well.
[2019.56 → 2020.88] Sell me on it, salesman James.
[2021.00 → 2023.38] They kind of botched some of the coolest things about it.
[2024.18 → 2029.34] So Amazon's, Amazon basics microwave with Alexa voice functionality will cost 60 bucks
[2029.34 → 2030.86] when released on November 14th.
[2031.72 → 2037.12] So originally I thought this is kind of cool because a lot of people want to add these assistants
[2037.12 → 2039.58] to their kitchen, but it always takes up more space.
[2039.58 → 2042.90] Like you're going to have liked one of these tablets on your kitchen countertop and I don't
[2042.90 → 2043.68] have space for that.
[2043.78 → 2044.88] I'm going to interrupt you again.
[2044.88 → 2048.12] Wired has been trying to link to these things the whole way through.
[2048.24 → 2048.64] I'm pretty sure.
[2048.70 → 2052.78] Because they're trying to get affiliate revenue, but they linked to the microwave, but it's
[2052.78 → 2054.16] not on Amazon yet.
[2054.24 → 2060.28] So the you click on the microwave, and it tries to like their automatic link identifier
[2060.28 → 2065.94] thing tries to bring us to .ca, and it just lists like some random black and Decker microwave,
[2066.18 → 2068.88] which has like three stars out of five.
[2068.98 → 2070.04] Like people don't even like that much.
[2070.04 → 2076.20] It also costs $772 because there's only one used one for sale and the pricing is just
[2076.20 → 2076.56] broken.
[2076.74 → 2077.92] So I was like, Oh, okay.
[2078.00 → 2080.40] I'll just, you know what their automatic link thing.
[2080.40 → 2081.36] He just served us.
[2081.42 → 2083.44] I'm going to switch that to.com.
[2083.56 → 2084.32] Did that.
[2084.74 → 2085.14] Nope.
[2085.14 → 2088.96] Just a bunch more random microwaves.
[2088.96 → 2092.74] I thought this was all like news links, but no, no, it's just affiliate links.
[2092.88 → 2093.20] Okay.
[2093.68 → 2094.42] Sounds good.
[2094.68 → 2095.26] Thanks guys.
[2095.46 → 2096.98] So you want an assistant in your kitchen.
[2097.30 → 2100.02] You usually have to add some extra device on your counter space.
[2100.08 → 2100.84] That sucks.
[2101.04 → 2102.96] So I thought you can just buy a whole new microwave.
[2103.36 → 2104.50] It's in your microwave.
[2104.50 → 2105.80] That's already taken up space.
[2105.88 → 2106.24] Sweet.
[2106.24 → 2109.54] But it turns out it's not actually completely built into the microwave.
[2109.72 → 2113.00] The microwave just pairs with, with an echo.
[2113.14 → 2116.10] So it doesn't have mic microphones on the microwave.
[2116.50 → 2120.80] So you still have to have your echo device within earshot or something like that.
[2120.88 → 2122.04] But it, okay.
[2122.20 → 2122.48] Nick.
[2122.58 → 2125.82] I was just going to say, with the amount of avocado toast that millennials are buying,
[2126.68 → 2131.42] all of our places are so small that one Alexa just fits your whole home anyway.
[2131.52 → 2132.00] Yeah, it does.
[2132.10 → 2134.14] Like I'm not Shaquille O'Neal with 17 bathrooms.
[2134.14 → 2136.20] No, that's what I was saying.
[2136.26 → 2140.52] Like the reason my Google home can hear me, even if I'm in bed, it ends in the living room.
[2141.06 → 2142.40] Because my room doesn't even have a door.
[2143.46 → 2144.66] My house is one room.
[2144.98 → 2148.12] Also like just use your phone with Google Assistant.
[2148.74 → 2149.22] Yeah, sure.
[2150.08 → 2154.52] But the reason I think this actually kind of works on a microwave is for a few different reasons.
[2155.06 → 2158.48] Number one, you don't want to learn how to do stuff on a microwave.
[2158.50 → 2160.52] I want to dash order popcorn.
[2161.14 → 2162.04] You don't want to learn.
[2162.14 → 2163.00] Have you seen a microwave?
[2163.00 → 2165.92] And you're like, okay, how do I, how do you set a timer on this thing?
[2165.94 → 2167.20] I don't think that's ever happened.
[2167.30 → 2169.32] How do you, they're confusing.
[2169.60 → 2172.22] Number, number, number, giant green start button.
[2172.26 → 2173.62] That's for the basic stuff.
[2173.86 → 2176.40] I just hit start and hope that it works.
[2176.46 → 2178.30] What are you doing in a microwave more advanced than that?
[2178.32 → 2179.92] Like defrosting a fish.
[2180.08 → 2183.80] And like there are tons of different advanced crap that no one uses.
[2184.00 → 2187.86] And partly because you just don't want to invest that much time into learning how to use it.
[2187.86 → 2189.44] Instead, you're just like, yeah, put it in for 30 seconds.
[2189.50 → 2189.96] I'll check it.
[2189.96 → 2194.70] But also partially because like if you use the popcorn setting, it burns your popcorn.
[2195.08 → 2198.14] So just learn how much time it takes to cook your popcorn.
[2198.14 → 2200.90] So this has presets.
[2200.90 → 2202.48] So you can put something in.
[2202.60 → 2209.80] And the example they have is, hey, assistant, heat up my, heat up one cup of coffee.
[2209.80 → 2211.26] Heat one cup of coffee.
[2211.54 → 2212.24] And it knows.
[2212.68 → 2214.58] Jeeves, heat my coffee, please.
[2215.12 → 2216.72] It knows what the item is.
[2216.72 → 2225.66] See, if it was an oven instead of a microwave, you could at least be like chilling on the couch and be like, preheat to 400 degrees, Alexa.
[2226.08 → 2226.54] Heck yeah.
[2226.64 → 2227.62] Because you didn't want to get up.
[2227.74 → 2228.14] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2228.14 → 2229.18] What are you going to do?
[2229.24 → 2230.18] Preheat your microwave?
[2230.44 → 2234.10] Dude, I'd be way more down with an oven-based version of this.
[2234.10 → 2234.24] Yeah.
[2234.40 → 2240.42] Even if you're not on the couch, even if you're just in the meal prep stage, if you're chopping something up, and you're like, oh crap.
[2240.42 → 2241.60] You get chicken all over your hands.
[2241.64 → 2242.38] Switch to broil.
[2242.66 → 2242.88] Yeah.
[2243.04 → 2243.24] Yeah.
[2243.24 → 2243.50] Boom.
[2243.96 → 2244.96] Yeah, I'm sure it's coming.
[2244.96 → 2246.78] This is just, this is number one.
[2246.98 → 2247.88] Do it up, Amazon.
[2248.36 → 2249.24] Get her done.
[2250.66 → 2251.54] Oh yeah.
[2252.14 → 2252.96] That's why I'm here.
[2253.06 → 2253.52] All right.
[2253.88 → 2254.02] Yeah.
[2254.12 → 2256.00] It's time for our favourite sponsors.
[2257.12 → 2257.52] Sponsors.
[2259.22 → 2260.02] Oh boy.
[2260.12 → 2261.12] Sponsor team.
[2261.46 → 2261.90] Assemble.
[2262.98 → 2263.42] Assemble.
[2263.98 → 2266.72] Half of you are gone because of the anyway.
[2268.98 → 2269.38] Synergy.
[2269.40 → 2270.44] Everyone can see this.
[2270.72 → 2272.90] That doesn't actually matter, but we're going to come back to us.
[2272.92 → 2273.48] It's us now.
[2274.28 → 2274.82] Let's see.
[2274.82 → 2275.06] Yeah.
[2275.18 → 2276.20] That's not my Twitter handle.
[2276.30 → 2277.38] There we go.
[2279.34 → 2279.70] Synergy.
[2279.80 → 2282.82] If you're an IT professional or a power user.
[2283.18 → 2283.64] I'm neither.
[2284.68 → 2285.74] You're not a power user.
[2285.82 → 2287.22] You wouldn't classify yourself a power user.
[2287.44 → 2288.08] It's a spectrum.
[2289.04 → 2289.40] Okay.
[2290.28 → 2291.34] That's who you're talking to.
[2291.42 → 2291.74] It's true.
[2291.84 → 2292.06] Yeah.
[2292.06 → 2297.92] If you're an IT professional or a power user or just person who has two computers or like
[2297.92 → 2300.68] a computer and a laptop, which is, that's still two computers.
[2300.76 → 2304.62] But anyway, at the same time that run different operating systems or the same one.
[2304.62 → 2306.70] I don't know why this is necessarily worded the way that it is.
[2307.40 → 2311.68] You can connect them together and share a mouse and keyboard between the two.
[2311.76 → 2316.50] My favourite use case for this personally is actually one that I've never done.
[2316.50 → 2318.26] I've done the more hardcore one, but whatever.
[2318.26 → 2323.62] is if you work with a laptop at work that you bring home.
[2323.98 → 2325.42] Quite a few people do this these days.
[2325.78 → 2328.98] A lot of workplaces just have docking stations, and you just bring your own laptop in.
[2329.30 → 2334.28] You can bring it home, put it on some type of laptop arm or dock or something like that,
[2334.50 → 2338.58] and Synergy will automatically detect that it's there and share your desktop's mouse and
[2338.58 → 2340.12] keyboard to that laptop.
[2340.54 → 2344.00] So if there's stuff you're working on, you want to keep working on it, or there was something
[2344.00 → 2348.50] you saw during the day or whatever, whatever, whatever, you could drag it from computer to
[2348.50 → 2352.74] computer because it has that functionality to just drag and drop from one desktop to the
[2352.74 → 2355.58] other, and it shares your keyboard and mouse between the two.
[2355.74 → 2357.28] It's super, super cool.
[2357.32 → 2358.10] I went off script there.
[2358.40 → 2359.08] That's dope, though.
[2359.44 → 2360.38] It's very cool.
[2361.00 → 2361.80] I've always liked this.
[2362.02 → 2365.48] For me, I had two computers set up.
[2365.52 → 2366.40] I don't even remember why.
[2366.88 → 2372.30] But if you go back and watch the original mineral oil computer video back when I was filming
[2372.30 → 2378.00] and editing videos, not in front of the camera, I'm filming Linus doing a room walkthrough
[2378.00 → 2380.86] of my room showing off my mineral oil computer.
[2381.30 → 2384.04] And there are two computers, but there are two keyboards and two mice.
[2384.52 → 2384.64] Yeah.
[2384.82 → 2385.64] And it was super late.
[2385.66 → 2386.40] That's Bush League, dude.
[2386.52 → 2386.76] Yeah.
[2387.04 → 2391.04] And I had different monitors set up for the different computers, and it was a nightmare.
[2391.48 → 2398.66] Anyway, you can check out Synergy and get signed up there at this crazy link that's
[2398.66 → 2402.18] below us, or if you're watching the GOD in the description down below.
[2402.76 → 2408.54] Next up, we've got Marina's with this six-pack of cold ones.
[2409.58 → 2411.72] Marina's coffee is coffee for fuel.
[2411.86 → 2413.04] Yeah, a little bit.
[2413.60 → 2418.46] They have big cans of cold brew coffee with a flavour for anyone.
[2418.58 → 2420.12] They have a whole bunch of different kinds of stuff here.
[2420.18 → 2429.80] I think this even has café caramel, café vanilla, café mocha, cold brew black, dark, and cappuccino,
[2429.80 → 2430.32] it looks like.
[2430.42 → 2431.56] Two times dark roast.
[2431.64 → 2432.56] Two times dark roast.
[2432.70 → 2432.86] Ooh.
[2432.94 → 2433.22] 2X.
[2433.70 → 2434.74] And they're stackable.
[2435.70 → 2436.50] Oh, my.
[2436.86 → 2437.66] Is that your own mug?
[2437.80 → 2438.10] Physics.
[2438.32 → 2439.08] No, that's Marina's.
[2439.56 → 2439.88] Oh, no.
[2439.94 → 2441.56] I thought, but like, do you use this one?
[2442.44 → 2442.80] Yes.
[2443.22 → 2443.64] All right.
[2443.84 → 2444.68] It's my daily driver.
[2444.68 → 2445.24] On point.
[2445.70 → 2447.68] From sweet and creamy flavours like mocha.
[2447.68 → 2448.56] Okay, we're going through this again.
[2448.82 → 2453.24] Like sweet and creamy flavours like mocha or caramel to bold and roast flavours like cold
[2453.24 → 2454.96] brew black and dark roast.
[2455.08 → 2460.42] Marina's coffees are delicious, specialty-grade blends of cold-brewed coffee brought to you
[2460.42 → 2462.70] in a convenient, ready-to-drink 16-ounce can.
[2463.04 → 2463.78] We carry that around.
[2464.08 → 2464.28] Yeah.
[2465.04 → 2468.30] From now until September 28th, you can get 50% off.
[2468.30 → 2471.76] That's one of my favourite things about the Marina's spots is they're always like aggressive
[2471.76 → 2472.56] with their deals.
[2472.94 → 2476.96] You can get 50% off your Marina's coffee order with discount code Linus.
[2477.48 → 2483.86] And the first 50 people to use code Linus will get a free bag of micro roast for international
[2483.86 → 2489.22] orders or a free six-pack of cold brew sampler like this where it has six different kinds
[2489.22 → 2493.06] of cold brew for U.S. and Canadian orders.
[2493.06 → 2500.04] So you get 50% off, and you get either a bag of micro roast or a six-pack of cold brew.
[2500.06 → 2500.76] How about the six-pack?
[2501.34 → 2501.52] Yeah.
[2501.60 → 2503.18] Well, you would get that because you're in Canada.
[2503.36 → 2503.94] That's what I'd get.
[2504.02 → 2504.60] So that would work.
[2504.78 → 2505.08] Nice.
[2505.38 → 2508.74] All details are at madrinascoffee.com slash Linus.
[2509.24 → 2515.04] If you have any questions about the coffee or the promo, Solomon Marina's is in chat right
[2515.04 → 2515.38] now.
[2515.38 → 2522.48] So you can add them, and they will respond with whatever answers to whatever questions you
[2522.48 → 2523.74] may or may not have.
[2524.52 → 2525.00] Squarespace.
[2525.50 → 2526.26] Standard sponsored.

[2536.84 → 2542.64] Squarespace provides award-winning 24-7 customer support via live chat and email because who
[2542.64 → 2543.66] wants to call people these days?
[2543.66 → 2546.70] Anyway, you can also attend a live webinar.
[2546.92 → 2547.36] You want pizza?
[2547.72 → 2548.66] No, I don't personally.
[2549.14 → 2549.80] Thanks though, Ed.
[2550.30 → 2554.66] You can also attend a live webinar or check out their help guides.
[2555.12 → 2559.84] You can now transfer your third-party domains to Squarespace's domain registrar thingy.
[2560.20 → 2564.38] So instead of working with multiple vendors to maintain your online presence, you can manage
[2564.38 → 2567.30] all of your domain and billing settings with Squarespace.
[2567.30 → 2571.14] So you can really like simplify the whole experience.
[2571.58 → 2574.22] It's never been easier to sell products or services online.
[2574.34 → 2579.62] Squarespace also offers a service for you to manage products, orders, and inventory all
[2579.62 → 2580.94] through their website.
[2581.10 → 2586.20] When you decide to sign up for Squarespace, make sure you use offer code WAN, W-A-N, to get
[2586.20 → 2588.66] 10% off your first purchase.
[2588.66 → 2595.32] And we'll have a link to that in the description below if you are watching the GOD, or you can
[2595.32 → 2598.40] just go to this link if you're watching right now.
[2600.18 → 2603.08] So I'm having a party for my birthday on Saturday.
[2603.20 → 2603.82] Luke, you can come.
[2604.08 → 2606.86] But Baron's asking me some details about it.
[2607.40 → 2609.46] I gave him my buzzer number so he can buzz up.
[2609.52 → 2611.12] And he's like, well, where does the buzzer go?
[2611.18 → 2611.94] Does it go to a phone?
[2612.22 → 2613.68] And I said, it goes to my wife's phone.
[2614.12 → 2615.78] And he says, cell phone?
[2615.78 → 2619.60] And then I say, no, my wife's landline.
[2619.74 → 2621.14] We have separate landlines.
[2621.98 → 2623.70] Of course, her cell phone, Baron.
[2624.12 → 2626.66] If you're watching this, JK.
[2627.06 → 2628.00] Why does he care?
[2629.28 → 2630.48] Does it make a difference?
[2632.06 → 2634.32] Now he's asking if her and I live in the same house.
[2635.34 → 2636.22] We're married.
[2638.52 → 2639.74] And we're under 80.
[2642.16 → 2643.02] Oh, boy.
[2643.32 → 2643.58] Yeah.
[2643.58 → 2645.12] So I'll see you guys all there.
[2645.80 → 2646.20] Everyone.
[2646.56 → 2647.52] Since my data got leaked.
[2647.52 → 2649.40] I was just going to say, everyone's going to know now.
[2649.90 → 2651.32] Go buy the NCAA data.
[2651.44 → 2652.32] Meet me at my place.
[2652.48 → 2652.74] Yeah.
[2652.86 → 2654.36] It's only a $15,000 to an invitation.
[2654.46 → 2654.98] Call me up.
[2655.62 → 2661.02] Anyway, Google's Chinese search engine links searches to phone numbers?
[2661.70 → 2662.12] Possibly.
[2662.28 → 2662.68] Allegedly.
[2662.88 → 2663.14] Maybe.
[2664.14 → 2667.38] Google is taking a second crack at offering its search engine in China.
[2667.74 → 2669.90] Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010.
[2669.90 → 2671.26] So it's been a little while now.
[2671.64 → 2675.92] After discovering a phishing attack targeting human rights activists.
[2676.18 → 2679.18] This time to comply with the Chinese government censorship requirements.
[2679.30 → 2680.52] Google is reportedly.
[2681.06 → 2681.62] Reportedly.
[2682.58 → 2684.06] Important operative word right there.
[2684.06 → 2691.14] Building a prototype system that would tie Chinese users' Google searches to their personal phone numbers.
[2691.80 → 2692.38] Google hasn't.
[2692.38 → 2694.44] Which they probably already kind of do.
[2694.58 → 2696.46] So they would just be giving that information to China.
[2697.46 → 2698.24] This time.
[2698.58 → 2699.06] Whoops.
[2699.06 → 2702.64] Google hasn't confirmed the existence of this project at all.
[2702.82 → 2705.86] Also extremely important line right there.
[2706.30 → 2711.78] It's previously said that it's only doing exploratory work on a search service in China.
[2712.02 → 2716.00] And that it's not close to launching a search product in the country.
[2716.22 → 2716.90] Very specifically.
[2717.36 → 2723.22] Around 1,400 Google employees have allegedly signed a letter demanding more information about the project.
[2724.46 → 2727.78] Which reportedly runs in partnership with a Chinese company.
[2727.78 → 2730.88] Apparently five employees have left because of the project.
[2731.30 → 2732.36] I have some questions about this.
[2732.68 → 2732.80] Yeah.
[2733.02 → 2733.68] First question.
[2734.38 → 2735.80] How many people are going to use this?
[2736.10 → 2739.28] Given that there's huge search incumbents there.
[2739.74 → 2740.82] Notably Baidu.
[2741.94 → 2744.16] Who's going to use Google when you've got to sign up?
[2745.10 → 2746.82] It's not frictionless like it is here.
[2747.12 → 2749.64] You're not going to be able to go to a new tab, Google, search for what you want.
[2749.70 → 2750.54] You're going to have to sign up.
[2750.82 → 2751.82] Do you have to sign up for Baidu?
[2753.40 → 2755.04] That's when you're going to input your phone number.
[2755.12 → 2756.70] But everyone already did sign up for Baidu.
[2756.70 → 2757.22] Right.
[2757.78 → 2760.32] I don't know how much of a footprint they're going to get there.
[2760.98 → 2761.88] Next question.
[2763.32 → 2764.62] This is more of a statement.
[2764.82 → 2770.16] I think that your phone number is tied to like your official government ID there.
[2771.94 → 2772.38] Yeah.
[2772.44 → 2773.18] So that's why this.
[2773.40 → 2773.78] For your.
[2774.68 → 2775.82] I'm going to butcher this.
[2775.94 → 2776.86] I don't remember what it's called.
[2776.96 → 2778.28] But you're like citizen standing.
[2778.90 → 2779.34] Ah.
[2781.58 → 2783.40] Which is like a really deep topic.
[2783.50 → 2784.56] That's like a new thing though, right?
[2785.30 → 2785.88] Newish.
[2785.88 → 2786.32] Yeah.
[2786.64 → 2787.02] All right.
[2787.50 → 2787.72] Yeah.
[2787.88 → 2788.76] That's its own thing.
[2788.88 → 2789.12] Yeah.
[2789.12 → 2790.64] That's very much its own conversation.
[2790.80 → 2792.38] And I'm not well-versed enough in that at all.
[2792.76 → 2793.96] You know what I am well-versed in?
[2794.06 → 2799.56] The first uncensored adult Steam game, which got banned in 28 countries after only coming
[2799.56 → 2799.80] out.
[2799.88 → 2800.42] I'm so surprised.
[2800.42 → 2801.42] On September 14th.
[2801.42 → 2803.58] That was fast.
[2803.72 → 2804.12] But you know what?
[2804.28 → 2807.30] It's still available in the US, Canada, and UK.
[2807.80 → 2810.58] And that's a lot of the people listening right now.
[2811.50 → 2811.92] It is.
[2812.00 → 2815.90] And now since it's banned, we all get to talk about it and see what all the fuss is about.
[2816.02 → 2816.94] And their sales get to go.
[2817.30 → 2817.94] We've been.
[2818.04 → 2818.36] Yeah.
[2818.36 → 2819.08] That's a good point.
[2819.36 → 2819.58] Yeah.
[2819.62 → 2820.68] Maybe that was the whole goal.
[2821.26 → 2825.36] We've been talking about this developing Steam conversation for quite a while now.
[2825.36 → 2830.08] I think this is the third or fourth time it's come into the show where Steam banned a game
[2830.08 → 2835.34] and then there became the whole topic of like, well, should they actually be the gatekeepers
[2835.34 → 2837.20] to what games get to be on the platform?
[2837.94 → 2840.84] Because at a certain point, you kind of stop.
[2843.10 → 2848.58] Like when you own so much of a space, people stop seeing you as a private company and start
[2848.58 → 2850.08] seeing you as like.
[2850.08 → 2851.10] Like an essential service.
[2851.24 → 2851.46] Yeah.
[2851.80 → 2852.06] Yeah.
[2852.06 → 2856.42] And it's not actually what happens, but people start observing your company as that.
[2856.86 → 2860.16] It's like when Target said that they weren't going to have Grand Theft Auto on their shelves
[2860.16 → 2860.54] anymore.
[2860.90 → 2864.82] It's like they thought that was some kind of breach of human rights or something.
[2864.88 → 2872.12] It's like if I open James Pizza Shop and I want to serve only ham and pineapple, I'm allowed
[2872.12 → 2872.50] to do that.
[2872.60 → 2873.24] It's my shop.
[2873.24 → 2873.68] You can absolutely do that.
[2873.68 → 2877.86] But you start to get kind of entitled and be like, no, Walmart has to have everything,
[2877.86 → 2879.74] a completely comprehensive selection.
[2879.74 → 2882.02] And if it doesn't, then they're just censoring.
[2882.96 → 2889.36] And there's some validity there because consumers could just go somewhere else.
[2889.62 → 2889.74] Right.
[2890.18 → 2896.28] So you start being seen as an essential service and then you kind of have to act that way
[2896.28 → 2897.50] or else people will just bail.
[2898.30 → 2901.04] Or you don't and then hope that you make it anyway.
[2901.32 → 2905.16] But Steam's approach was that we'll just add filters, and you can just not see what you
[2905.16 → 2905.72] don't want to see.
[2905.72 → 2909.06] And then apparently countries are just going to ban games anyway.
[2909.34 → 2910.94] So it doesn't really matter.
[2911.18 → 2911.48] Yeah.
[2911.56 → 2917.14] So the official statement from Steam, I believe, is like they do not endorse pornography or
[2917.14 → 2918.98] erotica in games.
[2919.60 → 2920.90] The game's still on the store.
[2921.40 → 2921.58] Yeah.
[2922.00 → 2926.36] But you're not going to see it unless you specifically tell Steam that you want to see
[2926.36 → 2926.92] those things.
[2927.10 → 2927.30] Yeah.
[2927.58 → 2931.00] And I'm 13, and I'm on Steam, and I'm just checking that box.
[2931.26 → 2931.52] Yeah.
[2931.52 → 2933.70] I'm sure most people are.
[2934.16 → 2936.88] I am definitely 28 years old.
[2936.94 → 2940.58] It's like those Flash games when you're a kid and the internet was new.
[2940.98 → 2941.92] You're like, are you at least 18?
[2942.38 → 2942.82] Sure.
[2943.14 → 2944.18] It's like, what year were you born?
[2944.50 → 2945.50] Scroll down to the 50s.
[2945.52 → 2946.54] That's definitely old enough.
[2946.80 → 2949.46] Dude, I used to troll and just make myself like a thousand years old.
[2949.64 → 2953.86] Because sometimes they just pull from like a database of years, right?
[2954.04 → 2955.08] So they wouldn't even check.
[2955.16 → 2955.98] Input the year?
[2956.10 → 2957.52] You're like 1676.
[2958.08 → 2958.32] Yeah.
[2958.32 → 2962.00] I was born in the 1500s.
[2962.14 → 2968.06] The game Negligee Love Stories is the first totally uncensored adult game on Steam.
[2969.48 → 2974.78] It's been banned in all sorts of usual suspect kind of countries like Saudi Arabia.
[2976.34 → 2976.56] Yeah.
[2977.30 → 2978.26] That's not surprising.
[2979.14 → 2982.90] The game's been banned in a number of countries for having uncensored naked anime girls.
[2984.12 → 2985.24] Damn cartoon boobies.
[2985.24 → 2985.76] Yep.
[2986.70 → 2993.80] They might release future games with a censored edition as the main release with a free or cheap mature content filter.
[2994.60 → 2996.36] Mature content release.
[2996.62 → 2997.96] I don't know what to call that.
[2998.08 → 2998.92] The opposite of filter.
[3000.06 → 3000.62] Uncensored.
[3000.80 → 3001.04] Unveiling.
[3001.26 → 3001.54] Yeah.
[3002.20 → 3003.64] The unveiling DLC.
[3003.84 → 3004.12] There you go.
[3004.30 → 3005.16] The RTX on.
[3005.42 → 3005.54] Yeah.
[3006.12 → 3007.10] Way on.
[3008.08 → 3009.84] I think they're a little bit worried.
[3010.06 → 3010.46] RTX off.
[3010.56 → 3011.12] RTX on.
[3011.20 → 3012.36] RTX super on.
[3012.36 → 3013.78] The switch is broken.
[3015.14 → 3016.28] Just holding the lever.
[3016.50 → 3016.68] Yeah.
[3017.18 → 3018.16] There's a quote here.
[3018.56 → 3029.48] If they find or targeted Steam as per our agreement with Steam, we, this is Darker Studios, we would be liable for all the costs and damages to Steam, which would end our company.
[3029.48 → 3036.34] And since we are a small indie developer and do not have the resources for such costs while making games, that would be a bad thing.
[3036.44 → 3047.32] And that's why they're considering in the future just kind of making it safe by default and then just charging you a bit more, having you to opt in to get in the dirty version.
[3047.32 → 3052.46] Speaking of things getting banned in different countries, Twitch has been blocked in China.
[3052.62 → 3053.64] You are trying to block me.
[3056.28 → 3071.50] Twitch has received an uptick in Chinese viewership over the last few months as audiences flocked to watch esports matches being played at the Asian Games in Jakarta, an event not broadcasted on state-run media in China.
[3071.50 → 3076.22] Last month, Twitch hit the number three spot among free apps in China.
[3076.64 → 3083.20] Downloads for the app of the week of August 27th rose 23 times higher than the previous week.
[3083.68 → 3088.20] China performed well during the event and brought back two gold medals.
[3088.38 → 3096.42] But now Twitch has been blocked in China with no official statement being released by Chinese authorities because they probably really don't care.
[3096.42 → 3102.70] The steady shutdown of access to Twitch was logged via social media in China.
[3103.04 → 3109.04] Viewers in many provinces reported that the site was suddenly unavailable in their region while it was still up elsewhere.
[3109.28 → 3111.46] By the end of the week, Twitch had been completely blocked.
[3111.46 → 3120.86] Yeah, so the way this works, I think, is that you kind of, obviously China, they like to control the activity that happens online.
[3121.16 → 3127.92] So if suddenly there's a lot of activity on a website, that kind of gets their attention.
[3128.48 → 3133.60] And so, for example, streaming is really popular in China, but they've got strict rules.
[3134.12 → 3135.04] Some of them are really weird.
[3135.04 → 3140.40] Like you are not allowed to stream yourself eating a banana because pornography is illegal in China.
[3140.40 → 3148.18] There became a trend of people just doing non-pornographic erotic things like eating bananas in a sexual manner while streaming.
[3148.48 → 3151.60] So then they just said, okay, eating a banana on a stream is illegal.
[3151.72 → 3153.02] So they have rules like this.
[3153.18 → 3156.20] And when suddenly a large portion of the Chinese population...
[3156.20 → 3157.76] What about like a voluptuous grapefruit?
[3158.58 → 3159.66] I'm sure you could push it.
[3160.64 → 3161.54] It's not a banana.
[3161.64 → 3162.40] It's a plantain.
[3163.28 → 3164.16] It's Gauthier.
[3164.48 → 3165.30] This one's an eggplant.
[3165.30 → 3169.34] There's another one you're not allowed to wear.
[3169.82 → 3170.96] Something you're not allowed to wear.
[3171.18 → 3172.68] I forget, but it's silly.
[3173.92 → 3177.74] So then you get a foreign website that gets a lot of traction.
[3177.88 → 3179.18] There's a lot of people watching streams.
[3179.56 → 3181.26] And they have no control of what happens on those streams.
[3181.84 → 3187.92] The population could be watching streamers who are talking about topics that are not friendly to the party.
[3188.32 → 3189.26] And that's no good.
[3189.30 → 3190.20] So they just shut it down.
[3190.20 → 3198.74] And if they think it's a compelling offering that the people of China should have in their lives, then they'll just get a Chinese company to make a carbon copy of it.
[3198.96 → 3199.06] Yeah.
[3199.68 → 3201.02] And then they keep the money in China.
[3201.40 → 3207.04] Someone in chat is like putting me on blast because I'm not using this opportunity to rep PIA.
[3209.42 → 3211.02] That's going to cost you PIA.
[3211.04 → 3211.60] They're helpful.
[3211.82 → 3212.52] TNX week.
[3213.10 → 3214.42] You might be in trouble in China.
[3215.96 → 3218.66] There are a bunch more topics, but we could also be sort of done.
[3218.66 → 3220.52] Is there any you want to talk about?
[3220.58 → 3221.54] Because there are a lot of topics.
[3221.66 → 3223.32] So is there any you specifically want to jump to?
[3223.36 → 3225.06] Here's one that's 10 seconds long.
[3225.24 → 3226.48] OnePlus is making TVs.
[3226.94 → 3227.62] That's all we know.
[3228.06 → 3228.88] We don't know when.
[3229.08 → 3230.30] We don't know how much they cost.
[3230.98 → 3234.16] We can be reasonably sure they're not going to actually make panels like LG.
[3234.40 → 3234.58] Yeah.
[3234.72 → 3239.66] Or what's the big Chinese one that no one knows, but it's actually third.
[3240.00 → 3240.22] Oh.
[3241.06 → 3241.64] Start with the T.
[3242.10 → 3242.38] TLC.
[3243.18 → 3243.48] Is it?
[3244.20 → 3244.88] No, TCL.
[3245.22 → 3245.56] TCL.
[3245.74 → 3246.60] They're not going to do that.
[3246.60 → 3248.32] They're just going to be a...
[3248.32 → 3248.54] Yeah.
[3248.62 → 3249.44] Tender loving China.
[3250.36 → 3253.54] They're just going to buy a panel from someone else and then put a casing on it and make their
[3253.54 → 3257.02] own on-screen display and somehow integrate it with their phones, I'm sure.
[3257.14 → 3258.30] But that's about all we know.
[3258.56 → 3258.72] Yeah.
[3258.78 → 3259.38] But that's cool.
[3259.70 → 3260.64] They make headphones good.
[3262.10 → 3262.50] Yeah.
[3263.18 → 3267.42] I don't know anything about this at all, but it seems cool.
[3267.86 → 3272.52] Europe and Washington State bands together to tackle the loot box problem.
[3272.52 → 3274.46] And it's a long topic.
[3275.10 → 3277.20] It's cool, though, because it just puts more pressure.
[3277.60 → 3278.34] Hopefully...
[3278.34 → 3278.66] Absolutely.
[3278.72 → 3281.60] There'll be no more loot boxes at all, but that's dumb.
[3282.40 → 3282.48] That'd be great.
[3282.48 → 3284.44] They'll make it freemium somehow.
[3284.68 → 3285.34] They'll find a way.
[3286.42 → 3287.64] Money will find a way.
[3288.22 → 3289.06] I hate loot boxes.
[3289.78 → 3290.62] See you at my birthday.
[3290.86 → 3291.34] My...
[3291.34 → 3292.82] I'm out of here.
[3292.82 → 3299.02] Honestly, one of my biggest problems with loot boxes is, I think, something that isn't
[3299.02 → 3300.50] being fought for very much.
[3301.04 → 3302.98] I hate that cosmetic items are in it.
[3303.44 → 3304.86] And a lot of people say that it's fine.
[3305.08 → 3309.18] But there are a lot of paid games that have cosmetic items in loot boxes.
[3309.42 → 3311.18] And I think that is horrendous.
[3311.18 → 3314.60] The old League of Legends model, especially then, it wasn't even a loot box.
[3315.36 → 3316.44] You just buy it.
[3316.66 → 3318.18] You buy the one you want, which is...
[3318.86 → 3320.06] Why is that so hard?
[3320.52 → 3321.72] You just get the thing you want.
[3321.72 → 3325.72] But with loot boxes, putting cosmetic items in it, it removes...
[3326.48 → 3329.70] In my opinion, it removes features from the game.
[3329.90 → 3332.46] And I think that's something that people aren't really paying attention to.
[3332.54 → 3333.54] Like, if you look at Destiny.
[3334.58 → 3336.68] Destiny, when it first came out, I've heard the new expansion is good.
[3336.76 → 3336.94] Whatever.
[3337.10 → 3337.46] I don't care.
[3337.50 → 3338.16] I'm done with that game.
[3338.36 → 3343.16] But when Destiny first came out, there was all this stuff to do, but it was extremely
[3343.16 → 3343.94] not rewarding.
[3344.38 → 3346.80] And you would hit a cap really, really quickly.
[3347.02 → 3351.42] And then the main things left to do in the game, in a lot of games, once you hit the end,
[3351.42 → 3353.86] is to make your character look really cool.
[3354.36 → 3356.50] And there were a lot of ways to pay for that.
[3357.02 → 3363.06] But there are so many systems in the game where it would have been really easy and absolutely
[3363.06 → 3367.80] would have happened, like, 10 years ago, if there were no loot boxes.
[3368.18 → 3371.90] They would have had, maybe not all the cosmetic items, but a lot of the cosmetic items that
[3371.90 → 3376.02] were there would be unlockable through doing something in the game.
[3376.02 → 3378.94] And you paid full price for this game.
[3379.08 → 3382.70] So having, like, additional challenges, like, oh, beating the raid in under a certain amount
[3382.70 → 3386.84] of time, or beating the raid with no deaths, or doing whatever else.
[3386.84 → 3387.22] It's not new content.
[3387.36 → 3388.46] The raid was already there.
[3388.52 → 3388.66] Yeah.
[3388.74 → 3390.52] It's just new incentive to play it a different way.
[3390.78 → 3391.00] Yeah.
[3391.06 → 3392.62] And that's huge for me, personally.
[3392.62 → 3394.58] I love weird challenge modes.
[3394.58 → 3398.82] I'll often, like, play a game on a not very high difficulty, but then make it so that,
[3398.90 → 3401.18] like, oh, I'm playing a shooter game, but I'm...
[3401.18 → 3401.68] You nerf yourself.
[3401.84 → 3403.30] I don't allow myself to use guns.
[3403.46 → 3403.54] Yeah.
[3403.54 → 3406.96] I have to use, like, just a knife.
[3407.08 → 3407.30] Yeah.
[3407.32 → 3409.60] I did that in Splinter Cell in the third one, Chaos Theory.
[3409.72 → 3409.86] Yeah.
[3409.86 → 3412.82] I was only allowed to stun the lights out, like EMP them.
[3413.16 → 3413.94] No bullets at all.
[3414.14 → 3417.44] I missed out on all the shotguns and snipers and all the cool things in that game.
[3417.58 → 3417.82] Yeah.
[3418.44 → 3420.32] But it makes it really a cool experience.
[3420.32 → 3425.70] And that's something you can do, and the game can also incentivize those types of situations,
[3426.28 → 3427.22] and they often...
[3427.22 → 3431.02] Games often do with cosmetic items or unlocks of some sort.
[3431.30 → 3438.24] Like, if you remember Smash back in the day, to unlock all the characters, you had to do
[3438.24 → 3438.66] some stuff.
[3438.68 → 3439.36] What did you have to do?
[3439.48 → 3441.22] I don't even remember, but you had to do some stuff.
[3441.60 → 3443.78] I feel like it required an all-nighter.
[3444.26 → 3447.98] It's like you had to do something with every character, some crazy thing like that.
[3447.98 → 3449.44] Like, it was kind of not...
[3449.44 → 3452.90] A lot of games used to have those types of systems, and those were really fun.
[3453.26 → 3455.16] And now most of those things...
[3455.16 → 3457.22] I'm not saying the new Smash doesn't have this one.
[3457.24 → 3459.22] I don't even know if the last Smash had that type of system.
[3459.56 → 3460.94] I'm not trying to throw Smash under the bus.
[3461.00 → 3464.24] I just remember that was a very legendary one, being able to unlock the characters,
[3464.36 → 3465.40] fairly core to the game.
[3466.34 → 3471.18] A lot of games used to have systems where if you did something at an advanced level or
[3471.18 → 3473.74] in a specific way, you would unlock something.
[3473.74 → 3477.82] And most of those systems have been removed in order to make it so you pay for those things.
[3477.98 → 3478.56] Yeah, that's weak.
[3478.78 → 3479.32] That is...
[3479.32 → 3480.58] I hate that so much.
[3480.62 → 3481.40] We need a new council.
[3481.80 → 3482.38] A new council.
[3482.70 → 3482.94] Yeah.
[3483.48 → 3483.72] Yeah.
[3484.02 → 3485.02] Hey, are there any more Super Chats?
[3486.32 → 3487.58] I don't know how to check.
[3488.54 → 3489.64] Like, 100%.
[3489.64 → 3489.72] I have no idea.
[3489.72 → 3491.12] Do you have to just scroll up or something?
[3491.66 → 3491.98] Oh, wait.
[3492.00 → 3492.56] Are they in line?
[3492.62 → 3493.06] Here they are.
[3493.42 → 3493.60] Oh.
[3493.84 → 3494.20] I think.
[3494.54 → 3494.76] Hello?
[3496.14 → 3496.88] Hi, boys.
[3497.92 → 3498.28] Notice.
[3498.54 → 3500.46] Luke is the best at responding to Super Chat.
[3501.88 → 3502.52] Two bucks.
[3502.80 → 3503.48] Hi, boys.
[3503.48 → 3504.48] Just want to say...
[3504.48 → 3506.28] Say you're beautiful people.
[3506.40 → 3507.44] My beautiful people what?
[3507.44 → 3508.76] Linus is not there.
[3508.90 → 3510.10] Please raise mic volume.
[3510.20 → 3511.04] Does this thing work?
[3511.44 → 3514.58] September 7th isn't in the playlist, by the way.
[3515.08 → 3515.46] Okay.
[3516.02 → 3516.90] Thanks, Gabriel.
[3517.28 → 3518.46] How many gig raised?
[3518.70 → 3519.48] Says Alexa support.
[3519.62 → 3519.86] LOL.
[3520.66 → 3521.50] DSS.
[3522.60 → 3525.66] Does the NCI data breach affect anybody?
[3526.12 → 3528.08] In a real first world country.
[3528.94 → 3529.34] Okay.
[3529.34 → 3532.34] That person must be from England because...
[3532.34 → 3534.82] Is that a shot at Canada and the US?
[3535.56 → 3535.86] No.
[3536.08 → 3539.64] I'm saying this from someone from the US making a shot at Canada.
[3540.44 → 3542.84] But I think Canada is more first world than the US.
[3543.04 → 3544.04] Get at me, haters.
[3544.34 → 3545.22] But there's NCI US.
[3546.52 → 3547.98] The US database is in there.
[3550.38 → 3554.22] On privacy flight, there's people with US addresses because the US database leaked.
[3554.28 → 3555.36] We're all wrecked together.
[3555.50 → 3555.74] Yeah.
[3556.22 → 3556.52] Unity.
[3556.88 → 3557.24] Unity.
[3557.24 → 3559.48] I have to get my carpool home.
[3560.02 → 3560.42] Ubuntu.
[3561.16 → 3562.56] Just get bunted.
[3563.40 → 3564.50] Turn off slow mode.
[3564.62 → 3565.24] It's what Linus...
[3565.24 → 3566.28] I don't even know how to do that.
[3566.90 → 3568.16] Luke, my girlfriend is in love with you.
[3568.20 → 3568.70] What do I do?
[3569.06 → 3569.34] Wow.
[3570.10 → 3570.66] Kill Luke.
[3571.66 → 3573.24] And take his...
[3574.54 → 3575.16] His loot.
[3577.20 → 3578.24] Unlock some new...
[3578.24 → 3580.74] He's just going to be sitting on the ground.
[3581.56 → 3582.58] Equip his items.
[3584.24 → 3585.32] Unlock new cosmetics.
[3585.32 → 3586.84] Plus three beard of wisdom.
[3588.14 → 3589.20] Minus two knees.
[3590.86 → 3593.80] When will NCX Tech Tips be doing a collaboration with Linus Tech Tips?
[3593.92 → 3595.84] Either that's a joke or you're really behind the times.
[3596.42 → 3598.42] Google Home or Alexa preference.
[3598.66 → 3598.80] Go.
[3599.44 → 3601.12] Google Home, but I haven't really played with Alexa too much.
[3601.18 → 3603.30] But it seems so geared towards ordering stuff on Amazon.
[3603.42 → 3603.82] I don't care.
[3604.02 → 3605.12] Exact same story for me.
[3608.32 → 3609.18] I don't know.
[3609.34 → 3610.58] Also, this shirt's for sale.
[3610.86 → 3611.58] There's a lot of these.
[3611.90 → 3612.16] Yeah.
[3612.16 → 3618.60] Are you RTX on enough to sport this thing and be swimming in the affections of the people you love?
[3618.94 → 3619.16] No.
[3619.32 → 3620.08] You can buy it.
[3620.44 → 3621.10] Get it.
[3621.30 → 3621.84] Get at it.
[3622.08 → 3623.46] It actually fits pretty good.
[3623.62 → 3624.82] I think this looks great on me.
[3625.72 → 3627.32] It does fit well.
[3627.68 → 3628.16] Yeah.
[3628.62 → 3628.92] Hell yeah.
[3629.26 → 3630.10] All right, guys.
[3630.26 → 3631.76] I think that's it for the show.
[3631.90 → 3632.90] Thank you for tuning in.
[3633.64 → 3637.76] Sorry it was like half an hour late because we were streaming to the wrong platform.
[3638.02 → 3638.58] So, rip.
[3640.26 → 3640.70] Rip.
[3640.70 → 3641.82] And I'll see you next time.
