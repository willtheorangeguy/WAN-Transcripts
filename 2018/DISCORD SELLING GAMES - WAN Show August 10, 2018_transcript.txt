[26.18 --> 30.54]  gonna be a good show we got lots of cool news like discord launching its own game store trying to
[30.54 --> 38.42]  be all steamy and new leaks about the google pixel 3 are you as excited as last year and not only that
[38.42 --> 44.98]  but also be careful about what laptop chargers you use because it could destroy your laptop and also
[44.98 --> 50.56]  another useless augmented reality headset don't call it that roll the intro bam
[50.56 --> 56.50]  yeah i love this intro i hope it never goes away is it good
[56.50 --> 68.12]  yeah little people they represent us today little full of himself i'm short with brown hair
[68.12 --> 73.16]  you're tall with darker brown hair that doesn't even look like luke savage jerky
[73.16 --> 84.62]  yep yeah fresh books fresh books my favorite i have what fortnight heck what the heck
[84.62 --> 94.26]  okay well all right we'll get there i guess download fortnight i mean don't i mean do it yes do it now
[94.26 --> 100.42]  get out get out now okay i'm only here because lias and luke are not available it's not because this
[100.42 --> 104.44]  is a permanent thing for everyone who's like ah get riley out of there i just wanted to make that
[104.44 --> 115.32]  clear okay so so wansho equals james if not linus or luke oh you're putting wansho equals equation
[115.32 --> 124.32]  james and riley when when linus when not you know luke when not equal linus and luke
[124.32 --> 130.92]  that's it yeah or there's an xor we can use all right sure i don't know equation talk it's
[130.92 --> 138.18]  programming bro i'm an artsy guy i don't know about numbers i'm a psychologist damn it i died
[138.18 --> 143.28]  i took psychology i have a psychology i have a psychology degrees all right well let's start
[143.28 --> 150.80]  talking about this game stuff then psych man mr scientist discord they got a big beta coming out
[150.80 --> 158.32]  part of that beta is a game store yeah this is a this is a huge deal this is actually the um
[158.32 --> 167.84]  the thumbnail story on netlinked or techlinked today represent um steam came out and was like
[167.84 --> 173.40]  hey we're gonna copy discord's chat chat services they got like the chat rooms and everything in
[173.40 --> 179.78]  steam now so discord was like oh yeah oh yeah you want to have just one product let's just be
[179.78 --> 184.78]  let's just make there just be one product yeah one copycat product no it's a little different
[184.78 --> 190.98]  because obviously i think it's a lot easier for steam to copy chat features than it is for a chat
[190.98 --> 197.42]  platform to copy a library because steam is like a it's a giant network it's a library of games that's
[197.42 --> 202.68]  way harder to implement yeah i mean so okay to be fair let's like go through what is actually
[202.68 --> 208.58]  happening so they're rolling out this beta to 50 000 canadian players uh they'll see oh let me stop you
[208.58 --> 214.34]  right there okay i had to google if these guys are if it is a canadian company is discord canadian
[214.34 --> 219.20]  i didn't look it up either i try i didn't find anything i think it would jump out if they were
[219.20 --> 224.80]  i'm just assuming they're american so why are they releasing the canadian players i don't is discord
[224.80 --> 228.86]  canadian does anyone in the chat i tried that i went to their wikipedia the wikipedia didn't even
[228.86 --> 232.52]  say where they're incorporated or anything anyone in the chat know if discord's canadian
[232.52 --> 240.04]  i guess yeah this guy says san francisco this guy says disco is american oh they're america
[240.04 --> 246.02]  so that no based in california people are saying yeah but that doesn't mean san francisco okay so
[246.02 --> 251.20]  they just like seem really they're just like oh we love canada something technical they got all the
[251.20 --> 258.00]  look it's a long time coming all right we never get anything first and this is we deserve this i think
[258.00 --> 262.38]  yes we're so nice all the time for all the times that you watch a keynote and they're like
[262.38 --> 271.14]  and we didn't stop there this is rolling out today today two three states yeah oh the worst is when it
[271.14 --> 277.80]  goes to the uk and australia before canada oh we're right here it's the french that holds us back what
[277.80 --> 287.06]  what was that dennis is laughing at us go away dennis yeah geez so i like us too dennis i'm so famous
[287.06 --> 293.02]  so they're doing two things to be fair so it's like it's it's a discord store where they're going to
[293.02 --> 299.52]  uh have curated games uh so not like your a list of games yeah yeah it's not gonna be like all the
[299.52 --> 304.54]  big ea games all the big ubisoft game it's like kind of more indie stuff like dead cells is on there i
[304.54 --> 309.90]  think frost punk some of those like popular games but not huge so they're gonna have discord store
[309.90 --> 313.32]  it's supposed to be like really personalized like when you click on it there's a little description
[313.32 --> 318.72]  of the game that's written by a a employee of discord that kind of gives their own little
[318.72 --> 324.92]  oh i like this game right oh it's like artisanal yes artisanal games oh yeah that's it this was
[324.92 --> 333.60]  handcrafted by tiny children in venezuela when i was just a boy i spent many hours okay there's that
[333.60 --> 340.24]  there's that and then they also are adding um like a subscription game type thing like a netflix
[340.24 --> 347.24]  for games type service uh to nitro nitro which is there is already existing subscription service
[347.24 --> 352.96]  yeah so nitro is just basically a way for people to just support discord and like donate to them it's
[352.96 --> 357.54]  kind of like patreon you're mostly there to give them money but in exchange you get some perks like
[357.54 --> 363.54]  being able to have a video or gif as your avatar and stuff like that and this new netflix of games
[363.54 --> 370.60]  is is just another perk really right it's a pretty ba perk though yeah i think it's not bad it's imba
[370.60 --> 384.70]  uh it's imba do you even play games imba like mba imbalanced imba imba i do play games
[384.70 --> 390.48]  i play games no i do but i i've never i've never encountered that before i mean i'm not like
[390.48 --> 395.30]  super maybe it's an rts thing no it's a shooter am i am i a fool for not knowing what imba means
[395.30 --> 402.42]  i know i know op i know nerfing imba is like the opposite of nerfing when something's in imba it gets
[402.42 --> 408.84]  nerfed it's op overpowered you well okay it's more general is more yeah you're correct about that
[408.84 --> 416.34]  it's like riley is a what girl what's ligma see what is imba people i think op is more who's the
[416.34 --> 423.56]  gamer boy now gamer boys and girls sound off all right um one thing that they're gonna have is
[423.56 --> 429.88]  first on discord games so these are gonna be indie games that discord helps develop they have some
[429.88 --> 435.72]  kind of stake in them and then they're gonna appear on the discord game store first right for 90 days
[435.72 --> 439.66]  usually before getting wider release to all the other platforms everything like that so that's
[439.66 --> 444.92]  kind of cool they're like kind of incubating some indie games that maybe wouldn't have as much of a
[444.92 --> 450.56]  yeah yeah an initial reach yeah it sounds like they want to they want to get some of that sweet
[450.56 --> 456.94]  steam-esque money that game store money but they also want to differentiate their service by you know
[456.94 --> 465.28]  being high touch right right artisanal artisanal i don't know how to say it artisanal artisanal it's
[465.28 --> 472.04]  artisanal that sounds wrong and it feels so good okay so they're also doing um because discord is
[472.04 --> 476.00]  kind of one of the things like and this is a indicator of this one of the things that discord
[476.00 --> 484.48]  seems to have been trying to do is kind of be the the hub for like pc gamers like hey it shows what
[484.48 --> 488.70]  your friends are playing it has all these chat rooms that you might be interested in you can like
[488.70 --> 493.02]  play music on there and people know what they're what you're playing and stuff so they want to be like
[493.02 --> 499.24]  the one-stop shop you go to your you turn on your pc you're going to do some gaming you open discord
[499.24 --> 506.10]  and this thing is uh leaning towards that they're adding a universal library so they want you to
[506.10 --> 511.60]  launch your games through steam now even that is a crucial feature through discord not how annoying
[511.60 --> 518.36]  is it to have to open up epic games launcher origin steam like a different launcher battle net just to
[518.36 --> 522.00]  launch whatever game you want to play at that moment so this is discord's gonna have a feature
[522.00 --> 527.12]  where it can scan your pc if you let it to detect all the games that you have installed and then you
[527.12 --> 531.50]  can launch them from the discord thing what it's gonna do is it'll launch steam and then launch the
[531.50 --> 536.08]  game yeah yeah yeah but at least this is one thing to click on at least you can have your i mean i think uh
[536.08 --> 542.18]  the windows tries to do that with like the xbox app i think you can do that in the xbox app that's
[542.18 --> 549.94]  built in but no one wants to use that because it's xbox so good luck discord power to you be better
[549.94 --> 556.72]  than microsoft cheers cheers cheers bud this one's for you yeah thanks genres for posting this by the
[556.72 --> 562.82]  way there's the forum post don't forget all this stuff comes from the forum love you genres yeah oh
[562.82 --> 568.08]  also well okay i put as a sub story for that followed 76 won't be on steam but maybe that that doesn't
[568.08 --> 575.98]  really fit in there okay so it fits in with the what's going on with the pixel 3 leaks let me tell
[575.98 --> 581.86]  you about the it's been ongoing yeah they've been well it's kind of like the um man it's kind of like
[581.86 --> 585.96]  the nvidia leaks right now like it's just so irritating how many of they are especially for
[585.96 --> 591.52]  you and i who like are going through all of the tech news like we go through every tech news story
[591.52 --> 597.04]  basically and trying to find the ones we need to talk about and there's like google pixel leaks
[597.04 --> 602.48]  nvidia leaks every other story it's like stop it and the most annoying thing is knowing how they
[602.48 --> 608.54]  vary week to week because the nature of publishing online is like well i need to write 15 articles today
[608.54 --> 615.30]  so any tiny minute change in the state of things is worth a new article so even if it doesn't give
[615.30 --> 619.88]  you new information like let's say this week we learned there's a notch or there's a leak that
[619.88 --> 624.82]  there's a notch and then next week well now it's confirmed that there's a notch well we already knew
[624.82 --> 630.46]  there was going to be a notch but now it's like more official man i hate the notch my first notes
[630.46 --> 635.60]  that i wrote in here are why why is there a notch it literally says why is the notch so big that's
[635.60 --> 641.16]  the only that's the talking why are not just a thing i really because so we've only seen the google
[641.16 --> 646.66]  pixel 3 xl so basically okay so what have we seen it's all glass there's no headphone jack two front
[646.66 --> 652.72]  facing cameras because of the notch obviously one front uh rear facing back camera not two like every
[652.72 --> 657.12]  other phone right now oh so they want bokeh on the front yeah but not on the back and they'll just
[657.12 --> 661.92]  use ai on the back they also got the fingerprint reader on the back it's got 2960 x 4040 display
[661.92 --> 668.92]  four gigs of ram and most likely a snapdragon 845 i would hope so that's not confirmed yet um
[668.92 --> 674.64]  and then also in the leaks that we made do you want to bring them up do you want me to click on
[674.64 --> 678.38]  that well do you bring things up yeah we bring stuff up do you bring things up so people can look at
[678.38 --> 683.18]  what do you want me to bring up i've never been on the ours article or you posted these yeah the uh
[683.18 --> 687.34]  the ours one man boom yeah just give them give them a little something something here it is people
[687.98 --> 692.78]  that's the screen we saw so for the people talking about case labs we did just see that like literally
[692.78 --> 699.50]  as we sat down so we don't really have any details of that but we'll we will talk about it uh
[700.06 --> 704.06]  in at some point i'm gonna click through this little slideshow um
[704.06 --> 711.50]  well yeah someone's like no 3.5 millimeter jack and a notch count me out tell you can say you can
[711.50 --> 717.10]  say that again big guy good great you know i'm actually more angry i don't mind the notch i'm
[717.10 --> 724.70]  more angry about headphone jack and uh i see the thing is see this is like everything that i don't
[724.70 --> 731.10]  want in a phone i want a headphone jack i don't want a notch do you want front firing dual stereo
[731.10 --> 736.06]  stereo speakers oh yeah because that's what a lot of people say they're like i don't care about thin
[736.06 --> 742.22]  bezels give me speakers on the front pointing at me and i don't care about that at all i don't give
[742.22 --> 749.82]  a rat's patootie about speakers on the front guys i don't the best speakers you could ever put in a
[749.82 --> 754.70]  phone are still gonna suck i'm using headphones i think it's obnoxious when people are in public
[754.70 --> 758.54]  listening to things on their phone that's very i hate it even when my wife's phone makes noise
[758.54 --> 762.38]  because she's watching a snapchat or something i'm just like ah i just hate it yeah i'm never
[762.38 --> 768.22]  using those speakers that's true i i it used to i think that was like i think one company put it on
[768.22 --> 775.18]  htc i think with one of their one phones like the m6 or m7 or something had front-facing speakers
[775.82 --> 779.98]  and everyone was like whoa front-facing speakers are so cool blah blah so then since then people have
[779.98 --> 785.34]  been like oh front-facing speakers are a good thing but i've i'm with you man screw that i think it's
[785.34 --> 788.78]  like people like it on paper or something like that it makes them feel more techy or something i
[788.78 --> 793.82]  don't know i want no bezels i want the full screen now the question see i don't care about that either
[794.46 --> 798.78]  it just looks so much cooler i'm i'm really like i don't care what my phone looks like i'm gonna slap
[798.78 --> 805.26]  a case on it either way so see i run nude oh really totally nude the first thing i do every time i get
[805.26 --> 812.54]  a phone is i buy an otterbox or or something spike in there i don't know i used to do that and then i would
[812.54 --> 816.94]  i would drop my phone tens of times a day follow my pocket when i'm on motorcycle around a concrete
[817.74 --> 822.78]  all the time i'm dropping it yeah that's what i do i i intentionally throw this around yes because
[822.78 --> 830.38]  i can exactly if you get a new phone it's gone good i just did it sweet baby jesus i'm crazy man if you
[830.38 --> 835.02]  get a new phone and you're already gonna treat it nicer because it's new yeah and you're like okay
[835.66 --> 841.02]  it's naked i'm just gonna i'm gonna treat it good i'm gonna make sure every time i reach down to my
[841.02 --> 845.82]  pocket that it's in the pocket before i let it go and you're just you just get these new habits
[845.82 --> 849.34]  i've dropped this thing like twice and one of those times is because i was in the movie theater and just
[849.34 --> 854.54]  fell out of my pocket since then i got a skin on it it's grippier see i'm just okay this is like a
[854.54 --> 860.46]  discussion for another time but like what's you know what's the point of not putting a case on and then
[861.02 --> 868.62]  like i might as well put a case on and avoid a future where you know my phone cracks and i have to get
[868.62 --> 873.74]  another phone because i was i didn't want to spend 40 bucks it's not about the money it's the bulk
[874.30 --> 877.50]  it's just you don't even have to spend 40 bucks you can go to the night market and get one for like
[877.50 --> 888.70]  six dollars or something anyways look okay stop stop it don't touch me um so this one comes with well
[889.26 --> 897.02]  apparently the leak there's pixel buds a usb so that's like a appears to be a wired version usbc version of
[897.02 --> 901.26]  the pixel like air the wireless pixel yeah that'll be interesting i wonder if they're going to be
[901.26 --> 907.10]  capacitive capacitative capacitive capacitive capacitive touch sensitive i want to be you
[907.10 --> 911.02]  know like on the pixel buds you can hold down on it and hail the google assistant with very low latency
[911.02 --> 915.18]  that'd be great if they had that included on these one thing that i thought was interesting is the there's
[915.18 --> 923.82]  a there's a d33p on the forums put a video like a new video of the pixel 3xl like just up just like just
[923.82 --> 928.22]  now or a couple or an hour ago or something and it shows that there's a volume rocker and a power
[928.22 --> 934.06]  button on the right side no buttons on the left side so i don't know what they're wasting that space
[934.62 --> 939.90]  maybe this is like an injury what do they have before i don't know get that pixel over here well you
[939.90 --> 943.90]  i'm sure you can still squeeze it right yeah they're probably gonna have that squeezable that's a
[943.90 --> 950.38]  pretty deep notch but you know what so is the uh iphone 10s the iphone 10 is a wider notch than a
[950.38 --> 955.02]  lot of the other chinese phones i really hope that pixel because i need a new phone i'm still rocking
[955.02 --> 961.18]  a galaxy s6 here guys and gals don't tell people that why that's been a while you do this to
[961.18 --> 965.18]  embarrass that's why i can throw it around also it's because it's got a case you're hoping it dies
[965.18 --> 972.06]  so you can justify it so i'm i'm i'm you know i wanted to get the pixel 2 but it's that you know
[972.06 --> 977.26]  they're releasing the new one soon so i really hope that doesn't even have a notch you see i really want
[977.26 --> 983.02]  a pixel three small version the regular one but it's probably not gonna have a notch it's gonna
[983.02 --> 989.18]  have two front facing speakers instead of sweet bezels like the form factor of the s9 like the edge
[989.18 --> 993.82]  display it's very thin bezel on the top and bottom that would be great if that was just a pixel though
[993.82 --> 998.54]  i don't want a samsung i don't even like i don't even like the edge anyways you know what this is not
[998.54 --> 1004.14]  this is not important is it we're done we're not even talking about the the story anymore we're just
[1004.14 --> 1009.98]  rambling we're just ranting okay well that was the story ranting's okay right this is the rant show
[1009.98 --> 1014.94]  on the last the rant show on the last one i think luke and linus just like ranted for like 10 minutes
[1014.94 --> 1018.94]  didn't they once someone came up to me at ltx and was like you know what i like about you on the
[1018.94 --> 1025.58]  wans show is you keep people on task on top you're doing the opposite right well you might still be
[1025.58 --> 1029.82]  doing better than linus oh that's the other thing it's got four gigs of ram and people are like four
[1029.82 --> 1035.50]  gigs isn't enough in 2018 for a phone yeah but pluses have those it could be enough i have no
[1035.50 --> 1040.70]  idea because i have a super old phone once again so guess what happened in the uk they changed the
[1040.70 --> 1047.26]  law and it turns out people were buying internet and did you skip one i rolled down yeah i'm not
[1047.26 --> 1053.02]  talking about right now why not i don't want okay fine so there was a law in the uk that if you were
[1053.02 --> 1062.22]  a provider of internet you could advertise speeds um that weren't realistic best possible scenario
[1062.22 --> 1067.10]  they were like as long as those speeds were actually deliverable to 10 of your user base you
[1067.10 --> 1071.98]  could advertise them so you might be able to say like 17 megabits a second but only like most people
[1071.98 --> 1077.90]  were getting 10 so the law changed it was involved in like a suite of laws that came into play like in
[1077.90 --> 1081.90]  may but it's just i don't know some research has been done recently to see how that affected
[1081.90 --> 1087.42]  all the different providers there and like 12 of the biggest providers who are all just names i've
[1087.42 --> 1095.42]  never seen before zen internet sky plus net i know about sky john lewis broadband john lewis
[1095.42 --> 1102.62]  broadband so british yeah exactly subscribe now john lewis broadband is that is that bad is that
[1102.62 --> 1109.10]  racist yes no i can do british we're not this isn't our car ride home we can't talk about this
[1109.10 --> 1115.26]  kind of stuff yeah um so the the way that the law changed was instead of it uh
[1117.18 --> 1123.42]  instead of the uh advertised speed only applying to at least 10 it has to be at least 50 of users
[1123.42 --> 1129.34]  during peak times so yeah a lot of them had to reduce their advertised speeds by like 40 or 50
[1129.90 --> 1134.78]  so now if it's if you advertise 17 megabit per second you have to advertise 10 or 11
[1134.78 --> 1143.34]  so like the the speeds that they're advertising just like drop ridiculously yeah like the poster from
[1143.34 --> 1152.14]  last year is like all new super lt 4 gen blarber 41 drop on average like that's what here bring the
[1152.86 --> 1161.02]  bring the thing up no don't they want to see this well it's not like a chart it's just like embedded in
[1161.02 --> 1168.70]  text i saw i saw a screenshot of like the new is that what it is of the new um like speeds and
[1168.70 --> 1173.42]  they're like ridiculous it's like you sign up for our lowest tier and get like 10 megabits per second
[1174.30 --> 1182.06]  oh my goodness well hmm hmm well hold on let me personally answer this uh hmm so this is why you don't
[1182.06 --> 1187.82]  bring up the things i'm gonna say no just because it takes less cognitive load there we go i'm okay i'm
[1187.82 --> 1192.46]  really sorry that i said anything see that's a big mistake this is bad this isn't even the thing
[1192.46 --> 1197.18]  at all you don't want to look at this here's some stock photos she's like huh is that slower or faster
[1197.18 --> 1200.70]  anyway the good thing about this is i hate when there's things in your life that are like
[1201.58 --> 1207.42]  oh yeah that's what it says but day to day you don't get those speeds like oh you're so naive you
[1207.42 --> 1212.22]  haven't you haven't learned the ropes that right even though it says 17 you're never gonna get that no
[1212.22 --> 1216.94]  one gets that i hate that i hate that stuff see but like this is what i'm confused about because here in
[1216.94 --> 1225.10]  canada i signed up for a 30 well now i have 80 but when i said well okay so i have 88 megabits per
[1225.10 --> 1232.78]  second down okay it's nothing fancy but like when i do a speed test if i don't get 76 at least i'm like
[1233.34 --> 1238.46]  what the heck is going on so how do these people like advertise hey you can get 50 and they're really
[1238.46 --> 1244.62]  getting like 12 how is that okay yes that's what because there's a little asterisk beside it that
[1244.62 --> 1249.74]  says like during the deadest times it's like your miles per gallon on a highway with the wind at your
[1249.74 --> 1259.50]  back it's like if no one else is online and you've got a pure platinum cable yeah hard lined in you'll
[1259.50 --> 1268.30]  be good just the straightest cable uh is this still cable if it's not flexible i don't know i don't know
[1268.30 --> 1274.70]  i don't know how those i don't know technology man man all right so they were all but the deal is that
[1274.70 --> 1281.50]  they were paying for that speed but now they do they pay less now because no no no well the thing is
[1281.50 --> 1286.94]  it's all relative anyway because it's all just based on the competition there's also different providers
[1286.94 --> 1293.50]  they're all probably providing the same speeds at the lowest prices they can yeah what are you laughing
[1293.50 --> 1298.46]  at sorry somebody said oh 80 megabits it's not 88 megabits for a second i have 80 and that's only
[1298.46 --> 1302.86]  after i got like an upgrade offer i had 30 before and i said 80 that's nothing fancy and then people
[1302.86 --> 1307.74]  were like oh nothing fancy i'm sitting here with 10 and i'm like that also sucks i'm really sorry yeah
[1307.74 --> 1316.30]  there's someone in korea it's like dude e equals mc squared dude what we're flying over here yeah we don't
[1316.30 --> 1322.94]  even use numbers i did hear that korea has like crazy fast internet i get 171 okay what do you want
[1322.94 --> 1328.78]  some money what do you want good for you yeah send some of that internet over here how about yeah what
[1328.78 --> 1334.30]  about us i'm sitting with 0.05 i'm really sorry about that i want to know about this magic leap
[1335.42 --> 1340.62]  let me tell you about magic leap uh james what's your name james yeah that's it is it
[1340.62 --> 1348.70]  little background magic leap has been teasing the sickest technology for years oh my gosh you've
[1348.70 --> 1354.22]  got these videos where you just put on these glasses and suddenly you have this super high resolution
[1354.22 --> 1361.02]  mixed reality objects in front of you like whales splashing let us know in the chat if you saw any of
[1361.02 --> 1369.34]  those like concept videos uh from like 2015 and stuff uh because they were ridiculous like i there
[1369.34 --> 1375.82]  was the hype for this company was through the roof the investor commitment the millions of dollars they
[1375.82 --> 1381.34]  earned and then in the recent months they they teased an actual physical implementation of like
[1381.34 --> 1385.26]  what these things look like they have these like steampunk look to them yeah i'm gonna pull that up
[1385.26 --> 1390.30]  well they do still they still yeah they do still kind of look like they're like a steampunky thing
[1390.30 --> 1395.98]  they got the really round lenses and stuff hololens is like a vibe i feel like it lies to you a little
[1395.98 --> 1401.42]  bit less than the hololens in terms of physical design because hololens has the big visor but really all
[1401.42 --> 1410.38]  you can see is like this little rectangular area i mean that's technically hollow is it no but uh um
[1410.38 --> 1414.14]  but these ones at least are like okay look this is what you're going to be able to see but even
[1415.26 --> 1424.06]  yeah they're like that but even with this the the round area is only a fraction or the it's only
[1424.06 --> 1428.62]  a fraction of that round area that you can actually see the holograms get out of town yeah yeah get out
[1428.62 --> 1433.58]  it's still like a little this isn't you can you can't see all of that it's like this little it's
[1433.58 --> 1441.42]  like a little rectangular area within the the circular area again that's so lame um so yeah i've been
[1441.42 --> 1449.90]  following this since 2014. that's basically our set yeah all right they're really copying us i'm
[1449.90 --> 1455.10]  getting out of here 2014 was the first i looked up the old script that i did for the ncix news show
[1455.10 --> 1462.14]  to netlinked okay i did in 2014 that was when we reported on it fall 2014 and like google put 500
[1462.14 --> 1468.22]  million dollars of funding into the company and then over the years they got more and more i think
[1468.22 --> 1473.10]  the their most recent estimate like a year ago or something was 4.5 billion dollars was the
[1473.10 --> 1479.82]  estimated good law value of this company so the hype was like crazy and so oh and that's the other
[1479.82 --> 1486.78]  thing they said they were using this like light field tech that is not just like putting light onto
[1486.78 --> 1494.14]  a screen they said they were gonna shoot light directly into your retinas yeah yeah you you saw that i
[1494.14 --> 1502.14]  like that you're into that the sun's doing i love that i love light field tech it's like field tech but
[1502.14 --> 1508.86]  light yeah but no that's not what it is they come out with it it's basically a hololens it's basically
[1508.86 --> 1515.18]  the same thing as a hololens they released the magic leap one creator edition it's like the developer
[1515.18 --> 1523.02]  version 2295 dollars uh which i think is not that far off from what the hololens was when they released the
[1523.02 --> 1530.22]  developer google glass was 1500 right and i think hololens was around there i did let me know in the
[1530.22 --> 1533.58]  chat if you know how much hololens was because i don't remember but i know it was expensive i'm not
[1533.58 --> 1538.22]  googling it you guys tell me we don't i haven't tried it but from the people who have tried it on
[1538.22 --> 1543.58]  the internet it's whack well it's not terrible that's the thing that's the thing that's disappointing
[1543.58 --> 1549.42]  about it like if it was like terrible terrible it'd be like oh look at that but it's like it's basically
[1549.42 --> 1553.26]  like the hololens like people were saying like it's maybe it's maybe a little bit better than
[1553.26 --> 1560.14]  the hololens but not much and then add on the fact that they don't even have any of like the software
[1561.18 --> 1565.90]  uh there for like because you know hololens is they're trying to integrate it into windows and
[1565.90 --> 1570.78]  stuff right soft is like software is their thing yeah like on day one i can take my excel spreadsheet
[1570.78 --> 1577.18]  yeah with my hands like tom cruise yeah move it over here and the only official uh experiences
[1577.18 --> 1583.10]  available for this right now is i well the only ones that i found there might be more but the
[1583.10 --> 1588.06]  only ones that i found were like a sigaros music experience type thing all right where it plays
[1588.06 --> 1594.86]  sigaros music play that a couple times the icelandic band oh yeah sigaros sigaros i'm not gonna pretend
[1594.86 --> 1603.34]  to be icelandic but i've heard icelandic people say it sigaros sigaros sigaros i'm just picturing you
[1603.34 --> 1608.46]  like you basically have that's gotta be any icelandic any icelandic people say gross
[1609.02 --> 1616.38]  sigaros you're turning into an old italian i'm doing it no no it's dude no i'm trying to do like
[1616.38 --> 1621.42]  a little bit like uh you know like uh bjork is bjork icelandic yeah she kind of has the voice like
[1621.42 --> 1627.50]  this it's like a little elf that's kind of dutch sigaros all right anyways they have a sigaros
[1627.50 --> 1632.62]  experience where it's like a music equalizer thing not equalizer visualizer and then they have like
[1632.62 --> 1639.18]  a project create which is like it's like a it's like minecraft or like these other you know those
[1639.18 --> 1641.66]  games that are like let you make games in the game
[1644.70 --> 1646.06]  dreams was one of them i think
[1649.66 --> 1654.30]  you can play god yeah yeah basically so they have that so you can like play around with things you can
[1654.30 --> 1658.30]  bake castles there's little knights that are run around you can like make like circuits and stuff
[1658.30 --> 1664.46]  but like other than that what's the point what's the point you know well and you also have to wear
[1664.46 --> 1671.10]  a little computer oh yeah the googles and the googles the googles and the poodles you've got the
[1671.10 --> 1676.86]  googles the poodles and the schnoodles and then you're set yeah that's a hard reveal to hey when they're
[1676.86 --> 1681.58]  like oh yeah it's not just these giant goggles you also have to wear this soup like it's basically
[1681.58 --> 1686.70]  like a pg maker a discman a discman yeah a walk mat that's the joke i made on twitter when they
[1686.70 --> 1692.46]  first revealed it i made a dish you're so ahead of me yeah why don't you eat this delicious jerky
[1693.74 --> 1698.30]  how no you can actually open that and eat it if you really yes savage jerky i've never had this

[2027.66 --> 2033.58]  i mean it might be if your mom plays that's fine can i eat the jerky again then yes yes you may
[2033.58 --> 2039.34]  it's a lot spicier than i thought it was now it wouldn't be a week of tech news without something from
[2039.34 --> 2048.54]  elon musk just right this week he may or may not have manipulated stock markets yeah uh if he goes
[2048.54 --> 2055.74]  to jail soon and the stock price totally tanks you'll know why so i i didn't understand this
[2055.74 --> 2062.30]  really so it's so he tweeted that he might take tesla private might might take tesla private funding
[2062.30 --> 2067.66]  security is what he wrote right so wait do we need to tell people what private and public companies mean i i
[2067.66 --> 2072.46]  i don't really understand that okay when you start a company i mean i understand that you go on the
[2072.46 --> 2077.02]  stock exchange basically it's like anytime anyone starts a company it's a private company it's owned
[2077.02 --> 2082.54]  by the people who start the company yeah and that's it when they get really big it's usually because they
[2082.54 --> 2089.34]  want to fundraise they make the company public which means that anyone can buy ownership of that
[2089.34 --> 2096.06]  company and that's what a share is so instead of me and you owning james riley corp suddenly thousands of
[2096.06 --> 2101.50]  people can own it and because they all i want to buy pieces of it you get a lot of money no i don't
[2101.50 --> 2105.18]  want other people to share in the special relationship you and i that's right because
[2105.18 --> 2110.22]  if they do then you have you're beholden to them so a public company that has shareholders they have
[2110.22 --> 2114.86]  to serve the shareholders the shareholders are represented by the board and every week the
[2114.86 --> 2118.46]  board's trying to make you hit target so you can make more money for the shareholders and all these
[2118.46 --> 2124.78]  annoying things that are really bothering elon musk so he would like to take tesla back from being
[2124.78 --> 2129.34]  public i think it's called a leverage buyout when you you were public and then you're like no
[2129.34 --> 2133.42]  we're just gonna buy all the shares back from everybody and we'll be private again just like spacex
[2133.42 --> 2139.18]  is yay so what he claimed in this tweet was that hey guys i found someone with enough money
[2139.18 --> 2147.02]  to buy all the shares back from you at a stock like a share price of 420 and at that moment
[2147.02 --> 2156.22]  420 am i right the stock price at that time was only 340 bucks so if that news was true then that
[2156.22 --> 2163.10]  means that the share i hold that's worth 340 is soon going to be worth 420 nice so a lot of people
[2163.10 --> 2167.66]  were like whoa i need to buy shares before that transaction happens because i as long as i buy
[2167.66 --> 2172.46]  those shares while they're worth less than 420 bucks i'm gonna profit but then once he tweets it
[2172.46 --> 2181.82]  the shares go up and then it's too late so if he makes a tweet like that he has to there's the uh
[2181.82 --> 2187.74]  the sec which is the what do they call it the securities financial the the federal communications
[2187.74 --> 2197.10]  what what fcc no the sec the securities exchange commission commission council triumphant uh so you're
[2197.10 --> 2202.70]  allowed to say that you're gonna do that as long as it's true if he if he actually does have a backer
[2202.70 --> 2207.02]  that was actually gonna follow through they've they've been in talks there's someone who has the
[2207.02 --> 2211.50]  money to do this he's allowed to share that information with shareholders he's even allowed
[2211.50 --> 2215.42]  to tweet about it as long as he tells the shareholders beforehand right as long as that's
[2215.42 --> 2220.70]  all true because if it's not true then obviously every other week elon could be like uh yeah someone's
[2220.70 --> 2225.26]  gonna buy it for about uh six million dollars a share and then the share goes and then the stock price
[2225.26 --> 2230.54]  and at that point he's just manipulating the markets yeah so after he tweeted that now there's
[2230.54 --> 2237.58]  an investigation uh into whether or not it's true and you can tell from the stock price right now
[2238.86 --> 2242.86]  that there's not a lot of confidence that it is true because when you first made the tweet we went
[2242.86 --> 2248.86]  with 340 up to about 380 at which point my accounting friends were like boot dude you should sell right
[2248.86 --> 2254.06]  now if you have tesla because there's no way this is real and it's just gonna crash and that's exactly
[2254.06 --> 2259.82]  what happened it went up to 380 and now it's back down to 350 because people think he's just bs-ing
[2259.82 --> 2266.62]  and you didn't sell well if i do have tesla stock oh you can't tell people that you stole that you
[2266.62 --> 2271.82]  that you sold it you can't tell people i think i can tell people that's not i don't know you're giving
[2271.82 --> 2275.18]  me this look like you can't tell people no you can tell people do you guys want to know i have some
[2275.18 --> 2283.18]  tesla stock not a lot it's just because i like tesla fancy boy ooh this is a stock market guy over here okay
[2283.18 --> 2288.38]  here's the thing i hated reading all the tech news about all the my favorite companies and they're
[2288.38 --> 2293.34]  doing cool things and the stock price is going up and you're just not a part of it right so it makes
[2293.34 --> 2297.58]  everything's more fun when you're kind of just a part of it and then you just you just do stocks
[2297.58 --> 2304.06]  because you feel like you're closer to mr musk you're kind of your role model maybe role model how
[2304.06 --> 2308.94]  do you think grimes feels about that i like grimes i've seen her live i support a.k.a. see partner
[2308.94 --> 2315.58]  what i see her live her name is she changed her name to c like the letter like the light speed
[2315.58 --> 2326.54]  of light constant oh yeah so always a capital okay um so do you think well i hope that uh i hope that he
[2326.54 --> 2331.82]  that he did let the shareholders know because if he did isn't that is it how big of a deal if it if
[2331.82 --> 2338.30]  they is it going to be if they find out that he did like screw up it's bad like if he just did it just
[2338.30 --> 2343.98]  willy-nilly yeah it's pretty bad not only is the share price the stock price will tank to sub 300
[2343.98 --> 2349.18]  for sure i think you can like it's fraud or something like that like he might even go to
[2349.18 --> 2355.98]  jail elon musk in jail wow he'd find a way he'd find a way out yeah the boring company just digs him out
[2357.74 --> 2362.94]  okay that's what the boring company is for yeah you're gonna dig me out he started it he started
[2362.94 --> 2367.10]  the boring company because he knew he would pull something like the tunnel's gonna go from my cell
[2367.74 --> 2373.26]  underwater to a floating autonomous barge while i'll launch on a falcon heavy to mars
[2373.90 --> 2377.82]  they'll never catch me he'll go from the real life iron man to like the real life
[2379.10 --> 2383.98]  super villain i don't know what's what's the super villain version of iron man lex luther yeah there
[2383.98 --> 2390.70]  you go he'll be losing his hair that picture all right so do you think he's he's not a dummy he knows
[2390.70 --> 2396.22]  finance and stuff we may be witnessing the birth of the first real life super villain that would be so
[2396.22 --> 2400.54]  fitting because everyone thought he's kind of like a superhero so he'd be like this fallen angel
[2400.54 --> 2408.86]  type oh my gosh oh by stock now before he does seem pretty unstable on twitter sometimes this is not
[2408.86 --> 2415.34]  what this podcast is about he called that guy a pervy guy who pedo dude that guy in thailand that
[2415.34 --> 2420.14]  that was the first time that like keep your comments to yourself pedo dude i was like elon what are you
[2420.14 --> 2430.14]  doing yeah i felt like like uh padme he was breaking my heart elon what stop you're breaking my heart
[2430.78 --> 2436.86]  from my point of view the sec is evil i killed them bezos
[2438.54 --> 2445.74]  yeah i'm on the bulb now uh i really wish i think in the future we can use blockchain technology to invest
[2445.74 --> 2451.42]  not only in companies but in people sorry somebody just put in the chat you were the chosen one
[2452.06 --> 2457.18]  yeah nice one okay sorry what if you can invest in people that'd be so dope like if everyone had
[2457.18 --> 2463.34]  their own crypto like coin invest in people yeah like so okay so elon sounds like elon gets with grimes
[2463.34 --> 2469.18]  right he starts dating grimes yeah people are like whoa grimes value is about to go up like she's trending
[2469.18 --> 2474.86]  i buy grimes coin and then like grimes was super popular because she's now by proxy super like
[2474.86 --> 2478.70]  more famous than she was she gets like record deals and tv deals so she's worth more money so
[2478.70 --> 2483.98]  their coin goes up and i own that grime coin i don't want to live in that world you're saying you

[2501.18 --> 2502.62]  good one
[2505.10 --> 2509.98]  i'm not good with the with the puns as i've just discovered after being here for some time what's
[2509.98 --> 2517.42]  this rom thing ooh roms ooh i know about those yeah pull it up i'm gonna put up the forum thing
[2517.42 --> 2521.26]  oh didn't they do something like this and brought black mirror they did with the the do you watch
[2521.26 --> 2526.86]  black i've seen every episode i love black one where um it's bryce dallas howard howard and she's
[2526.86 --> 2531.42]  it's the uh where you rate your friends on social media oh episode one of season three yeah that's
[2531.42 --> 2536.30]  big well or is that season four are there forcing i think that's the first one that was on netflix
[2536.30 --> 2539.58]  yeah season three season three that's a pretty good episode they did kind of sucked there's no
[2539.58 --> 2544.06]  investing in people in that but you do like kind of you have ratings and you go up and down and stuff
[2544.06 --> 2550.14]  yeah thank you to technicolor for posting this to the forum oh what the roms yeah i don't where
[2550.14 --> 2560.14]  is it i'm roms are roms over is it a rompocalypse hmm she's i don't know what you're talking about yet
[2560.14 --> 2568.38]  uh so do you guys know what roms are they can't rip you can't reply uh do you uh so roms are basically
[2568.38 --> 2575.58]  like the game file for uh games when you run in an emulator so if you're running like a gamecube or a
[2575.58 --> 2581.02]  wii emulator on your pc the rom is what you need to load in there so you can play the game there are
[2581.02 --> 2591.58]  all sorts of rom sites on the web and they're in kind of like a oh that was a bad analogy to make but
[2591.58 --> 2597.98]  they're under fire okay all right so nintendo just recently filed lawsuits against two huge emulator sites
[2597.98 --> 2605.02]  love retro and love roms we reported on this in tech linked um they sued them for 150 dollars
[2605.66 --> 2614.94]  per game 150 000 per game per game oh and two million dollars per trademark oh so like every
[2615.98 --> 2620.62]  so you like two million dollars for zelda no smash bros counts as one covers all of them
[2621.90 --> 2627.26]  yeah no it doesn't that's the thing so like just a massive amount of money we're talking here to like
[2627.26 --> 2632.14]  independently run websites by people who are just trying to like keep these games alive right like
[2632.14 --> 2637.34]  you download them for free i they get ad probably revenue from like hosting them and stuff but they're
[2637.34 --> 2641.34]  making money for sure yeah they're making money on this site but like you know they're not making money
[2641.34 --> 2647.66]  on the games per se but anyways so you please tell me that like it's one thing to smash these people
[2647.66 --> 2653.42]  into oblivion and offer an alternative yeah but if you don't it's like when they're yelling at people for
[2653.42 --> 2658.70]  torrenting game of thrones but then there's no nice way to watch game of thrones hbo yeah there
[2658.70 --> 2664.38]  wasn't exactly for a while so you're about to tell me that nintendo has an awesome store of classics or
[2664.38 --> 2669.02]  something like that well that's the thing they haven't launched the virtual so for a lot of their
[2669.02 --> 2674.30]  consoles in the past they launched a virtual console and you can just go on there like for the wii u or the
[2674.30 --> 2679.58]  gamecube one they don't have to go to gamecube but for the wii u you go or the wii you go on there and
[2679.58 --> 2683.82]  then you go to the virtual console and you can download all of these old games and play old
[2683.82 --> 2688.22]  retro games on your current console but they haven't launched that for the switch yet and there's a ton
[2688.22 --> 2694.54]  of things that aren't on the virtual console so that's what these rom sites uh that's the that's
[2694.54 --> 2701.82]  the service they provide so the big news here is that another site emu paradise paradise for emulators
[2701.82 --> 2707.42]  not for emus the bird okay that would be silly yeah they just uh stopped they said they're
[2707.42 --> 2712.14]  gonna stop hosting roms so i guess maybe they'll still have stuff about emulation i don't know i
[2712.14 --> 2715.66]  don't know whether they're still like continuing to go with just without roms or not but they're
[2715.66 --> 2720.86]  stopping hosting roms because i mean they didn't say specifically that they're doing it because of
[2720.86 --> 2726.46]  these lawsuits but the implication shoot into oblivion the implication is that they want to avoid a similar
[2726.46 --> 2733.18]  fate so um and apparently they were one of the few places on the internet that were not plagued by
[2733.82 --> 2737.98]  pop-ups and glitches and all this stuff because you can go and get roms on the internet but
[2738.86 --> 2742.46]  you know we can't have nice things there's no guarantee that the site that you're gonna go
[2742.46 --> 2747.58]  to isn't just like a trap and it's just like loading malware and stuff nothing gold can stay didn't i read
[2747.58 --> 2754.46]  that the virtual console on the switch is gonna cost money you read that i think i read that i haven't
[2754.46 --> 2760.62]  seen that i scrolled past that headline oh i think it's gonna cost money well i mean you buy the games okay
[2760.62 --> 2766.70]  i don't i didn't have a wii or wii u my parents had a week i actually would rather it was a
[2766.70 --> 2772.30]  subscription than buying the games i think hey put us in put in the chat do you know if you have to pay
[2772.30 --> 2777.50]  in previous consoles to access the virtual console i'm pretty sure you can you have to buy the games on
[2777.50 --> 2782.22]  the virtual console okay in order to play them so that's because with old games i'd rather just try
[2782.22 --> 2788.46]  them all i'd rather a subscription option because like some of them might suck and want to play for like
[2788.46 --> 2793.58]  20 minutes like the old games on the virtual like just old super nintendo games and stuff yeah see
[2793.58 --> 2800.54]  for me i'm not like i didn't the first the first console i had was an n64 so i played very little
[2800.54 --> 2808.62]  of uh the nes and snes sness snes yeah see now this is the thing they don't have the virtual console
[2808.62 --> 2816.70]  but they have the nes mini in the nes classic edition or whatever snes classic edition so are they
[2816.70 --> 2824.30]  going to release like the n64 classic edition probably and so on and so i want a tiny tiny
[2824.30 --> 2830.94]  gamecube the miniest of discs would that be okay though you know because i don't want to buy that
[2835.42 --> 2839.74]  why okay if they released an n64 uh mini and it was like a little
[2839.74 --> 2847.66]  and i wanted to play n64 games yeah i would buy it but like most of the time i feel like a lot of
[2847.66 --> 2853.10]  people are running things you know they want to have it up there for as like a backup or because
[2853.10 --> 2858.54]  it's not available on other services so like what about old like what about wii games that you can't
[2858.54 --> 2865.74]  play on switch right now you know like i don't know i think when nintendo should have before they do
[2865.74 --> 2873.74]  this kind of stuff they should have some sort of service yeah yeah well they i think if they if
[2873.74 --> 2877.98]  they crush these sites before the product launch then their product launch is more compelling so
[2877.98 --> 2883.18]  oh this is a good this is a good uh what's his name zr gaming just said in the chat i forgot to
[2883.18 --> 2890.38]  mention this the nes mini the classic editions that they launched uh actually like they took some of
[2890.38 --> 2897.34]  them apart and one of them was actually running like hacked roms whatever it takes like it was
[2897.34 --> 2904.54]  like the nintendo model and it was like running an emulator and roms just like so it's a little
[2904.54 --> 2912.62]  hypocritical nintendo huh okay so get your get your stuff straight let's go home what is that it yeah
[2913.58 --> 2920.30]  one more thing i wanted to say is is rom emulation morally good morally is is objective morality
[2920.30 --> 2930.86]  a physical truth a physical truth well i found the morality here there bam well got it what what
[2930.86 --> 2935.58]  and that's it there's no many more there's no more topics that's it that's all thanks for tuning
