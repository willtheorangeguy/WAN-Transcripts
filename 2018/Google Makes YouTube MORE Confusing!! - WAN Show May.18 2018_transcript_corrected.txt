[0.00 → 5.88] Are you ready? Are you ready for the show? It's good, because we're live.
[7.08 → 13.94] Oh, that whole time? No, no, no, just now. I've been saying, are you ready for a while? It's not
[13.94 → 17.64] like an impression or anything, it's just like a... Oh, I thought you said it. You said it so
[17.64 → 21.34] many times that I just assumed it was something I didn't get. I thought it was like Muppets or
[21.34 → 24.98] something. No, no, no, no, no, no. If I was going to do Muppets, I'd probably go like,
[25.14 → 29.12] oh, come at the frog here. Maybe we're going to do the man show like this. Oh, that's a great
[29.12 → 32.76] Jordan Peterson impression. Jordan Peterson, I don't even know who that is. Is that a reference
[32.76 → 37.26] that I should get? Is he famous? Yeah. Or she? I guess Jordan's one of those names that can go
[37.26 → 44.60] either way. All right, so we've got a great show for you guys today. Well, I mean, James is here,
[44.60 → 49.50] so it'll be an adequate show for you guys today. We've got new Google Glasses to talk about.
[51.76 → 57.60] VGA is apparently ditching CDs. Next week, a mop just...
[57.60 → 63.12] We don't actually, we didn't even have a mop. We had a broom. We did have a mop. Furthermore, we had a broom handle
[63.12 → 70.78] with a wig on it. Almost as good. A dozen employees quit Google in protest against a military project.
[70.78 → 78.56] And what else we got? Possibly new Google Glasses. It's still prototype phase. And VGA,
[78.94 → 84.24] not giving you DVDs anymore. Going to give you USB sticks instead. Wait, how do you not have the
[84.24 → 89.92] YouTube Red thing in here? That is like the biggest news of this week. I go to our forum.
[90.80 → 94.80] I look what's on the front page of the forum. Then, when I exhaust the forum, I go to my other favourite
[95.52 → 102.80] ours, TechCrunch, The Verge, Bloomberg. That must be on there. It's not. Okay,
[102.80 → 107.20] well, we're going to talk about that too. You're going to wing it. And I'm going to sit back and just take it in.
[107.20 → 111.76] It's good.
[111.76 → 113.76] Yeah.
[113.76 → 114.24] Music.
[116.48 → 119.04] Yeah. You're just, you're just talking over the music.
[120.48 → 124.40] It's good. It's terrible. No, it's good. No, it's terrible. People hate it. No, they love it.
[124.40 → 128.24] No, they hate it. Have you ever watched the have you ever not been on the WAN show and watched it?
[128.24 → 133.44] Because I lived my life before I worked here doing that. And I liked it. I liked when you guys talk
[133.44 → 138.72] during that. PIA. I think you were the only one. Oh, yeah. We probably should have had that on the
[138.72 → 146.64] screening before we hired people. Like, do you like it or dislike it when we talk over the intro music
[146.64 → 150.96] on the WAN show? And that's, so. That's disqualifying if you like it. Okay. So here's the thing.
[151.92 → 160.32] When we hire, we usually do some kind of skill testing quiz. And there are answers that if you
[160.32 → 166.64] get them wrong, your application gets immediately put into a bin. This guy likes the Matrix sequels.
[168.00 → 175.36] It's. I did, I did like that. Okay, that actually would. What? Okay. I was younger. Are you serious?
[175.36 → 179.92] I was younger than you when they came out for one. And it might only be three years,
[179.92 → 185.44] but that makes a difference when you're talking about like a 14-year-old. No, they were so bad.
[186.80 → 191.60] They should have. Okay. They're, they're different. They're, they're different. Okay. What were,
[191.60 → 197.68] were there, were there two sequels or three sequels? Well, there are three movies. So two sequels.
[197.68 → 204.72] Okay. So which, hold on a second. So Reloaded and Revolutions both came out in 2003.
[205.84 → 211.20] And is Reloaded the one with the two weird twins? Yes. Well, they're in both movies. Okay.
[211.92 → 218.56] So don't take this the wrong way, but I didn't even make it through the second one,
[218.56 → 223.44] let alone watch the third one, which I heard was much worse. The third one is worse.
[224.40 → 228.08] Okay. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater because yes,
[228.08 → 235.84] hear me out. Okay. What's the baby? The baby is like one of the best car chases in cinema history.
[236.40 → 241.68] Kick-ass fight scenes. Like there are parts of the matrix that aren't just the like counterculture
[241.68 → 245.68] and cool story. There are parts of it that make it a good movie. Like the Kung Fu and the fight
[245.68 → 252.56] choreography are sweet. And they're really sweet in that movie. Yeah. So the is the photography good too?
[252.56 → 256.24] The photography, the lithography. What about the cinematography?
[257.52 → 261.84] The cinematic. Whoa, I can't even do that one. I had to think about it for a little bit.
[261.84 → 268.96] Also, okay. There's a part where he fights a pile of CG agent Smiths that looks like dog junk now,
[268.96 → 274.40] but that was good. When it came out, it was cutting edge.
[274.40 → 285.12] Oh, good Lord. So, okay. I'll admit that watching that then I didn't get that. Cause okay. Honestly,
[286.48 → 294.96] the worst, the worst instances of like CGI aging badly and it really taking you out of the experience
[294.96 → 302.16] are when you see the evolution of computer graphics over the course of a series of movies.
[302.16 → 306.00] Yeah. Okay. So I think like Lord of the Rings did a pretty good job of this where even though the
[306.00 → 308.56] movies were released years apart. Yeah, but they filmed them at the same time.
[308.56 → 312.40] Did they film them all at the same time? Yeah, but they would have done the like post-processing later
[312.40 → 318.48] though. Like I know for a fact that scene in Return of the King where they're like surrounded by the
[318.48 → 324.64] entire army of like orcs and stuff. I know for a fact that was done like towards the end.
[324.64 → 328.96] And that scene probably wouldn't have even been possible with the computer hardware that was
[328.96 → 333.92] available when fellowship came out. Like that was a really, really demanding thing. Cause every single
[333.92 → 340.08] one of those had like some kind of like reactionary AI or something. So I heard they,
[340.08 → 346.16] I remember reading this article where they had a really hard time getting the, um, the heroes to not
[346.16 → 351.84] like try to break out and run away or something like they had to force them to stay inside this ring.
[351.84 → 352.72] Oh, I see.
[352.72 → 355.76] Because they, because they were like self-preservation things. Anyway,
[355.76 → 360.64] apparently it was part of the way that they did like the really large scale, uh, like overviews of
[360.64 → 367.76] the battlefield. Anyway. Um, so one of the series that really suffered from this for me is,
[367.76 → 372.56] uh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, people are, people are,
[372.56 → 375.84] are spoilers. We're talking about the Lord of the and the matrix.
[375.84 → 383.04] 99 people, uh, people are mad. Because we're not talking about tech. Okay. We are talking about
[383.04 → 390.64] technology and movies. Technically that is tech. Also like the Venn diagram is almost completely
[390.64 → 394.96] overlapped with this audience and Lord of the Rings and these movies. Like, how can you be?
[394.96 → 399.20] Anyway, anyway. Okay. So, uh, where was I going with this? Right. The Harry Potter movies,
[399.20 → 405.92] movies because not only were the first two and especially the first one done for sure,
[405.92 → 413.12] like before the later ones, because obviously that's how it works. Um, except Star Wars. So,
[413.12 → 420.08] okay. That's a thing. Uh, shut up. Not only that, but they were way lower budget. Like you can really
[420.08 → 424.16] tell looking at them, and you're like, Oh wow. They like weren't even really trying with some of this
[424.16 → 428.64] stuff. I remember being a child and seeing the first one and thinking that it was pretty good. Me too.
[428.64 → 432.24] That troll came on screen. But like, if it's cutting edge for the time, that's in the second one. But
[432.24 → 435.76] Oh wait, is that? No, you're right. That isn't the first one. Yeah. So, so yeah, it was, no,
[435.76 → 439.44] no, I don't even think that was top of the line at the time, but it was like pretty good. So they
[439.44 → 443.44] were lower budget. They were done earlier. And I went back and rewatched the entire thing. Cause
[443.44 → 448.72] they had like a box at Costco with the whole thing. And I bought it because I'm an idiot. Um, and I was
[448.72 → 455.28] like, wow, these are kids movies. And then prisoner of Azkaban rolls around. You're like, Oh yeah. Now that's one. Yeah.
[455.28 → 460.96] Now they're like real movies all of a sudden. Um, so do you think they should do a re-release
[460.96 → 464.28] like they did with Star Wars where they up like remaster it, make the graphics better?
[464.72 → 474.60] You know what? Because aside from Daniel Ratcliffe, Emma, whatever her name is, Watson, thank you.
[474.60 → 479.72] And then redhead guy, whatever. Yeah. I don't know if anyone knows. Universal Ginger, the most
[479.72 → 484.36] famous ginger ever. Yeah. What does he like to drive a bus now or something? What? Yeah. I heard he
[484.36 → 488.12] like got out of show business, and he just wanted to like drive a bus. That'd be sweet. Yeah.
[488.12 → 492.04] Donald Day Lewis moved to Italy for like five years. Just make shoes at one point. Yeah. Anyway, um,
[492.84 → 499.96] because aside from their acting getting markedly better also, like you could probably, you could,
[499.96 → 504.20] you could re-CGI it. I think you could actually make it a significantly more immersive movie.
[504.20 → 508.04] Hmm. We should get George Lucas on it. He should be on the team. Just oversee it. You know, he's got
[508.04 → 512.92] experience in this. He's doing a good job. He does a hell of a job when he undertakes those projects.
[512.92 → 518.84] Anyway, back to Agent Smith. Um, I will agree with you that at the time that didn't pull me out of
[518.84 → 522.84] the movie. Like I felt like that's pretty cool. Wow. It really looks like he's fighting a bunch of
[522.84 → 527.64] Agent Smiths. That was still a terrible movie. Well, that's the thing is a lot of people, the immersion
[527.64 → 531.88] not being broken for me. A lot of people just hate the fact that he fought a bunch of agents. Oh,
[531.88 → 537.88] I was actually okay with that because I was also a kid. Okay. Yeah. No, it was, I, that's like far
[537.88 → 541.96] from the worst part of that movie. It was just awful. What is the worst part? Is it when he has powers
[541.96 → 547.88] outside the matrix at the end? Spoiler. Uh, cause that's, I think like the biggest division between
[547.88 → 552.20] the first one and the sequels. I, I, you know what? I'm going to be honest with you. Furthermore, I don't remember
[552.20 → 556.76] it well enough. I just remember it being freaking awful. You're just bandwagon all the people who hate it.
[556.76 → 562.52] You should watch it again. I, the car chase. Okay. Look, I watched the first one again,
[563.08 → 567.72] like a couple of years ago. I did that last weekend. And it's so bad. Oh, it's awesome.
[569.88 → 577.56] Moving on. No, it is so bad. Like there's no way I would like the second one. If the first one has aged
[577.56 → 583.80] that poorly, it's so cheesy. The leather, like the leather is not cool anymore. No, no, it's not.
[583.80 → 591.72] And the worst part is that like, I've seen Keanu, Keanu, Keanu actually act reasonably well. I'm sure
[591.72 → 597.24] of it. Can't recall it right now. Can you say, whoa, as good as he says, whoa, in that movie?
[597.24 → 601.00] Now I feel like I have to try.
[603.48 → 607.88] I just, I just jumped, I just jumped from the building we're standing on to another skyscraper
[607.88 → 609.80] across the way. Whoa.
[614.04 → 616.20] That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. What a dick.
[617.96 → 623.40] You know what you remind me of? This pickle ad that I'm looking at. You know what? That's you.
[623.40 → 628.68] An angry green dick. Right there. That's you. Which one? Left or right?
[629.32 → 632.04] You know what? You're the shorter one. Huh.
[632.04 → 635.16] There. A little Gauthier though. Take that.
[636.44 → 640.12] All right. All right. Why don't we do an actual tech topic at some point here? So,
[640.52 → 648.52] The Verge has an article here on a reported new Google Glass. It'll be an AR headset and,
[648.52 → 652.12] oh, wow. I was going to say, it looks just as bad as the original. No, no, no.
[652.12 → 654.84] That's the original. Wait, no, that's the...
[654.84 → 658.92] I hesitate to even call it a new Google Glass because I suspect that they're going to change
[658.92 → 663.56] it altogether. That probably wouldn't be a terrible thing because it is impossible
[664.04 → 667.00] not to look like a complete jackass wearing that thing.
[667.64 → 671.64] Yeah. So, my theories about why the first one failed have to do exactly with
[672.60 → 677.16] the things that they thought were highlights. They thought it was so good that the camera was
[677.80 → 680.92] up and out of your eyesight. You had to look up at it to see it.
[680.92 → 681.80] What do you mean the screen?
[682.52 → 684.44] The camera and the screen, but I mean the screen. You're right.
[685.80 → 689.88] But that makes it so useless because what you want is like a mixed reality. You want all the
[689.88 → 693.56] digital stuff to be right there superimposed. That's what they're doing with this one. It's
[693.56 → 695.64] more like HoloLens. Okay.
[695.64 → 697.24] But it's untethered.
[697.24 → 703.08] Self-contained. It'll have cameras and microphones, and it'll use the same new Qualcomm chips as the
[703.08 → 710.76] upcoming HoloLens. So, it's a QSC 603 4-core chip based on an ARM architecture. It'll be built by
[710.76 → 716.20] Taiwanese computer maker, Quanta, and is apparently still in the prototyping stage.
[716.20 → 718.20] So, is that all we know about it right now?
[718.20 → 722.84] I think so. I think that's basically, I would say it's probably on the same
[722.84 → 727.88] bit of production cycle as the rumoured Apple, what's it called, Project Titan, their glasses.
[727.88 → 728.76] Google's.
[728.76 → 729.16] Hmm.
[730.68 → 732.28] Whose do you think will be better?
[733.96 → 740.12] Because Google will have a much better AI. I mean, Siri, I swear, Siri has actually gotten
[740.12 → 742.12] dumber over the last few years.
[743.16 → 749.16] I would think that Apple's would maybe be a better hardware product and their AR kit and AR stuff is
[749.16 → 753.88] quite good, but it will certainly be tethered with the iPhone because Apple now makes products
[753.88 → 759.24] to squeeze more money out of iPhone users. Whereas this being purportedly untethered,
[760.52 → 764.68] like I'm reading that as completely standalone device. You don't even need to have a phone.
[764.68 → 768.84] If that's true, then it has this system on it to be useful.
[768.84 → 769.48] Right.
[770.76 → 773.72] And that's a whole different game. That's the apples and oranges at that point.
[773.72 → 780.20] Okay. Man, I don't even like, I don't, I'm just trying to hear. Okay. Here's my issue with
[780.20 → 787.96] augmented reality is like, you know what? I actually, this is unusual, but I want to hear
[787.96 → 794.60] from Twitch chat. I want you guys to start throwing some, some, some messages in the Twitch chat. Let me know
[795.88 → 803.56] what, and you can't, you can't hedge, you can't hedge. Okay. You got to pick one. What is one thing
[804.28 → 810.68] that you want AR glasses to do that would make you buy? And I'm going to throw a price point at you.
[811.80 → 815.40] Let's say they're not cheap. I'm going to say 500 US dollars.
[815.40 → 816.52] Oh, I thought you were going to say a thousand.
[816.52 → 823.88] No, 500. I think 500 is reasonable. So 500 US dollars and you pull the trigger immediately.
[823.88 → 828.68] What's the feature? Go. So are you ready with one? Because I've got one.
[828.68 → 831.96] If you want to, let me go first. Okay. So for me,
[831.96 → 837.88] one of the things that I have, like, I can't think of anything personally that would inspire
[837.88 → 844.68] me to spend that kind of money because my entire life pretty much revolves around my phone screen
[844.68 → 850.84] or my computer screen. And I've, I don't find myself having a desire to overlay information
[850.84 → 854.44] on top of a screen with a screen. Like that's not really a thing. I get up in the morning.
[854.44 → 859.32] I like check the news on my phone. I ate my breakfast. I take my kids to school. Furthermore, I drive.
[859.32 → 864.04] So I'm driving. Then I get to work. I sit down in front of my computer, or I'm shooting, in which case
[864.04 → 867.40] I'll have my phone with me if I need to like to send out a quick tweet or whatever, something you won't
[867.40 → 874.60] be able to do with glasses anyway. Then I drive home. Then I spend time with my kids. Then I am on a
[874.60 → 880.28] screen or, or not on a screen, ideally that that's it. So I'm, I'm never that far away if I like really
[880.28 → 887.24] need to, you know, look something up, and I've smartwatch too, of course, for me, the justification
[887.24 → 897.00] would be business. Okay. So when I'm travelling, if I had the ability to be at like a, um, some kind of,
[897.00 → 905.40] a cocktail mixer or something, or if I walked into a business meeting, um, or like the suite at Computer
[905.40 → 913.24] for Asus and this thing starts recognizing people that are on my social networks. So then all I have
[913.24 → 919.40] to do is like add people to Facebook or LinkedIn or something like that. Yeah. Okay. But here's the
[919.40 → 928.28] thing. It needs to do it well. So it needs to be able to go, okay, here's their name. Here's a couple
[928.28 → 934.52] things about them. Here's the last email that you exchanged with them, if applicable. Like it needs
[934.52 → 941.48] to be able to aggregate all of this data and help me avoid embarrassing situations where like, I'm
[941.48 → 946.44] like, yeah, it was really nice to meet you. And they're like, we've had three meetings over the
[946.44 → 952.36] last, you know, eight years. And I'm just like, well, that's enough meetings that I should feel really
[952.36 → 959.56] bad. But in my defence, when I go to these types of shows, I usually meet anywhere from 200 to 500
[959.56 → 965.32] people in a span of a week. And I'm sorry, but unless you're, you have like bright orange hair
[965.32 → 969.80] on one side and bright purple hair on the other side, I'm probably not going to remember you.
[970.60 → 974.04] It's how Max got hired by the way. She was the most memorable applicant. No, I'm just kidding.
[974.68 → 977.80] I actually wasn't involved in the process. What you're describing sounds to me like
[977.80 → 984.44] what the Facebook app for that form factor would be. Yeah. And it's consistent with Google's
[984.44 → 989.48] ultimate vision, which is not only like here, can I jump in? Because these are going away
[989.48 → 994.52] too quickly. Can I jump in with some other people's things? Sorry, hold that. So, oh, man,
[995.64 → 1000.04] some people are asking for unreasonable things like complete replacement of your smartphone and
[1000.04 → 1007.08] smartwatch input. There's no the input. Yeah, I don't think that makes any sense. Okay, Google Maps with
[1007.08 → 1013.40] AR. Yeah, I can see that having a value. That'll be sweet. The navigation is just over top of
[1013.40 → 1019.24] the road. Yeah. All right. But really 500 bucks, you'd buy it for that. Like how often do you really
[1019.24 → 1024.04] navigate somewhere? Exactly. If I was an Uber driver, maybe. Yeah. So again, that's a professional
[1024.04 → 1034.52] use though. Google search info. Okay. Wow. Holy crap. This is just moving way too fast. If this
[1034.52 → 1041.96] device respected women, I'd buy it like that. Dash cam feature like shadow play, being able to go back and
[1041.96 → 1046.36] record any moment in your life. Just recording everything. There's an episode of Dark Mirror like
[1046.36 → 1052.92] that. Or Black Mirror. You don't want that. Yeah, I could see it being useful, but it's also a big
[1052.92 → 1061.24] problem. When does that? Oh, wow. Relationship status. I could see a lot of people buying it for that.
[1061.24 → 1066.92] That would be sweet. Like if basically like the Tinder app for that form factor, you walk around,
[1066.92 → 1074.28] it's like, yep, that's a Tinder user. Oh, wow. That, okay. Imagine like real world Tinder,
[1074.28 → 1080.12] people walking around with these headsets, just like, oh wow. And you could swipe with your head.
[1080.12 → 1086.76] So you just look at people and be like, no, yeah. Nope. Nope. Like you're walking up to someone,
[1086.76 → 1090.68] you see them. There's a thing over your head. You both know the others on Tinder. They're looking at
[1090.68 → 1095.56] you going like this. You're like, nah. So you like, you make eye contact across the room and
[1095.56 → 1103.64] you're both just like, yeah. Oh, man. Heck yeah. Um, a lot of people are saying. What a desk though.
[1103.64 → 1110.12] Nope. A lot of people are saying porn, but like, why? Like, why do you, who would want to be walking
[1110.12 → 1116.60] around with like a raging erection because they're like watching porn while they're on the bus? Like,
[1116.60 → 1121.40] what is the point of that? Like, I know, I know. Okay. So here's the thing is like,
[1121.40 → 1127.32] I think most people are probably just saying that to be funny, but I'm sure at least a handful of you,
[1131.00 → 1136.44] I'm sure at least a handful of you will legitimately would watch porn on a plane or on a bus or whatever,
[1136.44 → 1143.72] if you could. And to those people, I would say, really? Like, really? Like, I think,
[1143.72 → 1149.00] I think, you know what? I think I'm not going to get into it. Imagine all the extensions you could
[1149.00 → 1154.52] get, all the hilarious filters you could get where like someone's talking to you, and you just see
[1154.52 → 1160.68] objects around their head, like wants coming at you, wants around Linus. Viewing schematics and
[1160.68 → 1166.84] diagrams, like large scale schematics and diagrams. Like if you could have whatever you're working on
[1166.84 → 1172.28] and then you could just like to have a picture in picture effectively over your vision of,
[1172.28 → 1175.64] of like a manual or something along those lines. That's actually what I would pick. What I would
[1175.64 → 1181.24] pick is a collaborative, uh, like virtual object app where you and I could sit, we could be having
[1181.24 → 1185.32] a conversation. You have an idea. You want to describe the idea to me. Instead of using limited
[1185.32 → 1190.60] language, you just say, okay, here's a cube, and you rotate it, and it tracks your hands so you can
[1190.60 → 1196.68] manipulate it. Arista ca has another commercial purpose. If you worked at a car dealership and the client comes in
[1196.84 → 1202.92] asks you a question about like that used car, like, you know, who was the previous owner?
[1202.92 → 1208.28] How many kilometres does it have on it? All of a sudden you can just be like, uppity bop pity,
[1208.28 → 1212.36] sir. I've got all those answers for you. Give me one minute. I just have to stare at the car for a
[1212.36 → 1216.68] second. Uh, yeah, hold on, hold on. Yeah. Okay. It's all loaded. All right. So here's what we got for
[1216.68 → 1222.36] you. I mean, I can see that again, another professional application. So I see this being a professional
[1222.36 → 1226.68] device initially, uh, much like HoloLens. But that's consistent with Google's
[1226.68 → 1232.20] what's Google Lens, right? Google's ultimate aim was to bring information to you before you query
[1232.20 → 1235.88] it. You don't even have to search. It comes to you as you need it. And that's what Lens is. If you
[1235.88 → 1241.48] looked at Google IO last week, they had demos where you're, you're basically walking around Chicago and
[1241.48 → 1247.72] you look at a historic building and up comes the Wikipedia page for it. And it's an AR, so it's got
[1247.72 → 1252.60] the nice depth to it. That's, that's exactly what you're talking about. You look at an object of
[1252.60 → 1257.32] relevance to you and like the yeah, but I guess I just, you know, I'm not much of a like
[1257.96 → 1262.12] information about this building buff. Like for me, you walk by a restaurant and that kind of looks
[1262.12 → 1267.56] okay. And then there's the four-star rating, the reviews. Okay. That would be useful, but here's
[1267.56 → 1275.32] the problem. It has to actually work. Like I was in London this week, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm standing where
[1275.32 → 1280.28] I'm standing. I got my little, you know, blue dot facing whatever direction it thinks I'm facing.
[1280.44 → 1287.08] That seems to be just kind of like a, Oh yeah. Come on, baby. Like I agree with you there. Yeah.
[1287.08 → 1293.48] It's not accurate at all. Um, and I searched for food, which I would think would bring up restaurants
[1293.48 → 1299.88] or restaurant or whatever. I searched for something and it just, it's just random. Like, like I walked
[1299.88 → 1307.56] past an Italian restaurant that looked fine and had a good rating when I like manually searched for it
[1308.44 → 1312.60] on my way to the Italian restaurant that it brought up in the search result. I'm just kind of sitting
[1312.60 → 1319.80] here going, Italian was right in the name, and it was on my way. Like it was closer to me than the
[1319.80 → 1325.16] thing that you found. Like it just seems arbitrary as sometimes. And so it's, it's frustrating for me to,
[1325.16 → 1329.72] for, for Google to come out and say, we're going to have this amazing technology. Your phone
[1329.72 → 1333.16] is going to call your hairstylist and make an appointment for you. You're going to put on
[1333.16 → 1336.68] these glasses, and they're going to dynamically tell you everything you need to know about
[1336.68 → 1343.00] everything you're looking at when they don't even have the basic stuff working right now. Italian
[1343.64 → 1346.76] freaking restaurant. Oh, there's a problem right there. And it still can't handle that.
[1347.88 → 1356.44] I wanted pizza. Okay. I actually didn't want pizza. I just wanted anything that my wife would also eat.
[1356.44 → 1357.08] That's what I wanted.
[1360.04 → 1364.76] That is got full. I did that for you. Oh, thank you. I did that. I got ice. No,
[1364.76 → 1368.12] I intentionally didn't put ice in because when you have ice in your water bottle, you drink it weird.
[1369.40 → 1372.92] You can tour your mouth so that the ice doesn't come out. I just don't like the way your face
[1372.92 → 1379.96] looks when you do it. I don't like warm water though. It's not warm. You know what? Just, just for you,
[1379.96 → 1385.08] I'm going to drink my water like that all the time now. Show everyone what I'm talking about. Don't you hate that?
[1387.08 → 1393.64] Just deal with it. Just, speaking of deals, this episode is brought to you by Marina's Coffee.
[1394.68 → 1399.40] Was that a segue and a half or what? Speaking of warm, Colton didn't put these in the fridge. I would
[1399.40 → 1406.92] chug one of these right now like Stone Cold Steve Austin. Um, Marina's Coffee is coffee for fuel. Big cans of cold
[1406.92 → 1412.44] brewed coffee with a flavour for everyone. From sweet and creamy flavours like mocha or caramel to bold
[1412.44 → 1417.00] and roast ones like their cold brew black. Marina's coffees are delicious specialty grade
[1417.00 → 1422.28] blends of cold-brewed coffee given to you in convenient ready to drink 16 ounce cans. And from now until May 25th,
[1422.28 → 1428.92] this is the best part, you can get half, that is 50% off all Marina's Coffee orders with code Linus.
[1429.56 → 1435.64] And the first 50 people, these guys are like the craziest sponsor in terms of their deals. The first 50
[1435.64 → 1442.84] people to use code Linus will get a free six-pack of cold brew. Free. Free six-pack.
[1442.84 → 1447.56] I read that earlier, so I already submitted mine. I'm going to be number one, baby.
[1447.56 → 1453.88] You really shouldn't do that. You have to, it's for the viewer. Anyway, uh, go to madrinascoffee.com
[1453.88 → 1458.36] slash Linus and the instructions for adding the free six-pack to your cart can be found at the bottom of
[1458.36 → 1463.24] the page. That's the link. And by the way, Solomon from Marines is in the Twitch chat if you have any
[1463.24 → 1469.96] questions about flavours or how to order. Uh, Solomon, if you're watching, uh, if you wanna just process
[1469.96 → 1475.40] James's order at full price. I was kidding. I'm giving you the approval to do that. You've got,
[1475.40 → 1480.52] you've got your, you've got the approval to do that. Um, I'm pretty sure. Double it, double the price.
[1480.52 → 1484.12] Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm, I can give you permission to charge his credit card, right? Like that's,
[1484.12 → 1487.40] if he works for me, then the money ultimately comes from me anyway. I'm your slave.
[1487.40 → 1494.68] Yeah. So, um, yeah. Uh, screw it. My whole paycheck on, on coffee, put it on black roast.
[1497.24 → 1501.64] Uh, private internet access, private internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and
[1501.64 → 1506.84] types of encryption and authentication. So it's, it's a VPN and you can dial in the protection
[1506.84 → 1510.76] however you want. They've got apps for windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome with
[1510.76 → 1515.24] support for other platforms coming soon. You can connect up to five devices at the same time. So you can
[1515.24 → 1520.60] have liked your server and your home computer, your laptop, and both of your phones. It's actually a
[1520.60 → 1526.52] lot of devices and the coolest thing about private internet access, since I know you guys probably
[1526.52 → 1532.36] already have it, is that you can get it as a gift for people that you know that should use a VPN,
[1532.36 → 1537.24] but don't. So you can get it as a gift for them, set it up for them, turn it on, configure it so that
[1537.24 → 1541.96] it's just always on. And then you don't have to worry about whatever it is that they do,
[1541.96 → 1545.80] their information getting tracked, all that good stuff. That is sweet. Go check it out at
[1545.80 → 1554.52] privateinternetaccess.com slash pages slash Linus dash tech dash tips. Uh, oh, oh, we've got one
[1554.52 → 1564.20] more sponsor, actually. Who could it be? Us! Haha! Uh, get tickets at ltxexpo.com. It is a meetup and
[1564.20 → 1571.00] interactive tech event. It's going to be on July 14th at the Richmond Olympic Oval here in BC, Canada.
[1571.00 → 1576.60] The current booths include a LAN powered by burrower, a de-linking workshop, so you can
[1576.60 → 1581.80] devoid a CPU. You bring your own CPU, we'll show you how to devoid it. Case Toss 2.0.
[1583.24 → 1585.64] Were you, were you at LTX last year? I...
[1585.64 → 1587.88] Did you work here yet? I staffed the Case Toss.
[1587.88 → 1590.84] Right, right, right. So that was, how dangerous was that out of 10?
[1590.84 → 1593.96] A woman almost, almost actually... Forget it, forget it.
[1593.96 → 1596.44] This year there's a cage around. Yeah, Case Toss 2.0.
[1596.44 → 1602.20] It was like 9 out of 10. Uh, multi-headed VR will be there. Uh, 12k ultra-wide gaming,
[1602.20 → 1606.84] and we've got more stuff on the way. There's going to be food, music, cool systems to look at,
[1606.84 → 1610.36] um... Cool Angers. Extra room to stand in.
[1610.36 → 1616.52] Uh, more games, more swag, special guests. I believe, uh, Jay is planning to be there,
[1616.52 → 1622.04] so that's going to be pretty sweet. Uh, we have some people who are, like, committed on paper, but, like,
[1622.04 → 1627.16] don't wanna necessarily 100% lock it down, so they don't want us to, like, talk about it,
[1627.16 → 1631.64] but there, there should be other celebrity guests there as well. Is Obama going to be there?
[1631.64 → 1635.96] No, Obama's not going to be there. Um, so tickets start at $35 Canadian. You can get them at
[1635.96 → 1640.52] ltxexpo.com. Colton, I'm done the spot for LTX Expo. You're not allowed to talk about it anymore.
[1640.52 → 1642.20] He doesn't even know that Obama's going to be there.
[1642.20 → 1643.48] L-T-X!
[1643.48 → 1646.36] Obama's not going to be there. Uh, no. Yeah, no.
[1646.36 → 1648.04] He could be. No. He can buy a ticket.
[1648.04 → 1651.96] Unless it's, like, some other Obama. Like, if you go in the phone book, and you look up Obama,
[1651.96 → 1653.64] Obama. Like, are there other Obama's?
[1653.64 → 1654.20] It's possible.
[1654.20 → 1655.96] Is that a common name? I don't think so, right?
[1655.96 → 1656.60] I don't think so.
[1656.60 → 1657.32] Yeah, I don't think so.
[1657.32 → 1658.60] Barack is.
[1658.60 → 1659.48] Is that a common name?
[1659.48 → 1660.12] No, yeah.
[1660.12 → 1661.00] Oh, of course.
[1661.00 → 1663.08] During his presidency, a lot of people named him Barack.
[1663.08 → 1665.48] So there's a bunch of, like, seven-year-olds named Barack.
[1665.48 → 1666.04] Yeah.
[1666.04 → 1666.68] Interesting.
[1666.68 → 1668.36] Or, like, 12.
[1669.00 → 1673.16] That would explain why I keep encountering more and more Sinuses. It's because, like,
[1674.60 → 1676.04] I inspired parents to...
[1676.04 → 1680.92] I don't think the plural of Linus is Sinuses. I think when you have multiple Linus, it's just Linus.
[1680.92 → 1683.80] No, I think we've... No, no, no, no. It would be, like, Linus Eye or something.
[1683.80 → 1684.20] No.
[1684.20 → 1684.84] Oh, yeah.
[1684.84 → 1685.32] Nexus.
[1685.32 → 1687.64] Or Lin-Eye. It would be, like, Lin-Eye.
[1687.64 → 1688.04] Nexus.
[1688.04 → 1690.04] Like, like, like, penis is Pen-Eye.
[1691.88 → 1693.40] That's true. You have a point there.
[1693.40 → 1700.52] Uh, VGA ditches CDs for USB sticks. This was originally posted on the forum by Vegetable Stew,
[1701.00 → 1701.72] and the original article...
[1701.72 → 1703.00] I love that guy's name, by the way.
[1703.00 → 1704.52] ...is from, yeah, it's S-T-U.
[1704.52 → 1705.64] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1705.64 → 1706.04] What?
[1706.04 → 1708.12] Um, yeah, Vegetable Stew.
[1708.12 → 1709.24] Like, it's his name.
[1709.24 → 1709.80] His name is Stew.
[1709.80 → 1712.04] Dang it, Nantes. How do I get rid of this? Thank you.
[1713.00 → 1716.68] So, this is actually something I asked you, I asked you as a noob.
[1717.32 → 1720.92] I was like, why are they giving discs when I don't...
[1720.92 → 1722.76] I and everyone else doesn't have...
[1723.88 → 1724.60] Yeah, drink it.
[1725.08 → 1727.88] ...doesn't have a DVD player anymore.
[1727.88 → 1734.12] And you told me it's because it's way more expensive to give away flash drives.
[1735.32 → 1740.92] And VGA actually confirmed that. Even though VGA is ditching DVDs for all the drivers,
[1740.92 → 1743.16] and giving you an 8 gigabyte flash drive instead,
[1744.28 → 1748.68] they actually did admit that it's 20 times more expensive to give you a flash drive.
[1748.68 → 1749.80] They're still doing it.
[1749.80 → 1752.36] So, 20 times more expensive would be like...
[1754.04 → 1754.84] Because how much does...
[1754.84 → 1760.60] I think a disc costs like on the order of like 3 cents or something like that.
[1761.16 → 1765.08] Like, basically, it's probably costing them a few bucks though, for each one.
[1765.08 → 1769.32] With that said, VGA has a bit of an advantage here compared to other motherboard makers,
[1769.32 → 1772.76] because they don't really make any entry-level boards.
[1772.76 → 1780.84] So, every motherboard that they sell will have enough margin in it that they could probably afford to throw in a USB drive.
[1780.84 → 1783.88] And there have been high-end boards before that came with USB drives.
[1783.88 → 1784.12] Yeah.
[1784.12 → 1785.32] They're not the first to do it.
[1785.32 → 1786.52] That's freaking awesome though.
[1786.52 → 1789.48] Especially because flash...
[1789.48 → 1795.72] Like, NAND flash has gotten to the point where it's not any more cost-effective to make like a...
[1795.72 → 1799.56] A 1 gig USB drive than it is to do an 8 gig USB drive.
[1799.56 → 1801.64] Like, 8 gigs are the size they start at.
[1801.64 → 1803.24] So, that's what VGA is providing.
[1803.24 → 1811.08] And what's cool about that is 8 gigs is exactly the right size for you to be able to use it for an installation ISO.
[1811.08 → 1812.36] A DVD ISO.
[1812.36 → 1813.88] Oh, I thought you were going to say two Blu-rays.
[1814.76 → 1815.96] No, because it's not enough for that.
[1815.96 → 1818.04] I thought a Blu-ray was like 4 gigs.
[1818.04 → 1819.32] No, DVD is 4 gigs.
[1819.32 → 1820.52] Blu-rays are like 40.
[1820.52 → 1821.00] What?
[1821.00 → 1823.40] DVDs were like 700 megabytes.
[1823.40 → 1824.28] No, that's CDs.
[1825.72 → 1827.56] CDs are 650 or 700.
[1827.56 → 1828.92] DVDs are 4.7.
[1828.92 → 1831.48] And then Blu-rays are like 40...
[1831.48 → 1832.04] And 80...
[1832.04 → 1833.08] Like, they go up much higher.
[1833.08 → 1834.92] Like 20, 40, 80 or something like that.
[1834.92 → 1840.92] When I used to be a scumbag who tormented movies, they were always about 700 megabytes.
[1840.92 → 1843.08] Yeah, that's because they were like...
[1843.08 → 1843.88] They were 720p.
[1843.88 → 1847.08] ...seriously downscale so that scrubs like you...
[1847.08 → 1848.12] Yeah.
[1848.12 → 1852.92] ...who were too cheap not only to buy movies but also to pay for more internet download...
[1852.92 → 1854.20] Definitely, yep.
[1854.20 → 1856.52] ...didn't go over their data limits.
[1856.52 → 1857.96] Yeah.
[1857.96 → 1859.96] So Blu-rays are 25 and 50.
[1860.92 → 1861.80] 8 gigs.
[1861.80 → 1862.36] Okay.
[1862.36 → 1862.52] Yeah.
[1863.88 → 1864.52] Um...
[1864.52 → 1866.52] Well, you can put some Word documents on it.
[1866.52 → 1867.48] How about that?
[1867.48 → 1868.60] Uh, wait, 8 gigs?
[1869.24 → 1870.76] No, you can put a DVD...
[1870.76 → 1872.04] You can put an ISO on it!
[1872.04 → 1873.08] That's what I'm trying to say!
[1873.08 → 1873.64] Wait!
[1873.64 → 1878.92] So they say the cost increase will not trickle down to the consumer, which is of course nonsense.
[1883.48 → 1888.68] I think all that means is they're not adjusting the pricing of their current generation of boards,
[1888.68 → 1894.28] but that doesn't mean that when they consider the BOM cost, the bill of materials, for their next generation,
[1894.92 → 1899.08] that they won't consider that that's another two or three dollars or four dollars...
[1899.08 → 1902.04] What do you mean? This could have been two dollars cheaper this whole time?
[1903.56 → 1908.60] Um, okay, this was originally posted over on Gizmodo.
[1908.60 → 1915.00] Um, it was posted on the forum by Paris, Paris? Paris, I think.
[1915.72 → 1923.56] And dozens of employees have quit Google in protest against a military project, what is this, Project Maven.
[1923.56 → 1924.36] Okay, wait a second.
[1925.16 → 1926.44] A dozen, not dozens.
[1926.44 → 1927.56] Yeah, sorry, a dozen.
[1927.56 → 1928.44] A dozen, so far.
[1930.76 → 1934.76] So, Project Maven is a project that Google's working on in collaboration.
[1934.76 → 1935.80] Really a project.
[1935.80 → 1938.20] They called it Project Maven, and it's a project.
[1938.20 → 1938.28] It's a project.
[1938.28 → 1939.08] Wow.
[1939.08 → 1940.12] It's an undertaking.
[1940.12 → 1940.68] Wow.
[1940.68 → 1941.08] Wow.
[1941.08 → 1941.96] Okay, you do it.
[1941.96 → 1942.68] Do tell me more.
[1942.68 → 1943.24] No.
[1943.24 → 1947.96] No, actually you have to do it because I'm checking on notes on the YouTube premium thing that you didn't
[1947.96 → 1948.68] put in here.
[1948.68 → 1953.08] Despite protests from employees, why would an employee ever protest?
[1953.08 → 1953.64] Yes.
[1953.64 → 1958.12] Google is charging ahead with the Department of Defence collaboration to produce machine learning
[1958.12 → 1961.32] software for American military drones.
[1961.32 → 1967.64] Project Maven aims to speed up the analysis of drone footage by automatically classifying images of objects and people.
[1967.64 → 1974.44] And now a dozen people, Google employees, are resigning in protest over the company's continued involvement.
[1974.44 → 1980.12] And this is in addition to about 4,000 employees who have voiced concern in a petition that was circulated internally.
[1980.12 → 1981.48] Yeah.
[1981.48 → 1991.24] So basically Project Maven is a way of using AI to identify targets in for and okay, it doesn't
[1991.24 → 1997.16] say explicitly, but the assumption, so this is all like allegedly, but the assumption is
[1997.16 → 2003.08] that the technology is going to be used to identify targets for drone strikes is ultimately what people
[2003.08 → 2004.44] are mostly upset about.
[2004.44 → 2011.64] Google has emphasized, though, Google claims it is only providing open source software to Project Maven, which means the
[2011.64 → 2016.52] military would be able to still use the technology even if Google didn't accept payment or offer technical
[2016.52 → 2019.88] assistance, and they have emphasized that its AI is not being used to kill.
[2020.44 → 2027.40] The technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from
[2027.40 → 2029.24] having to do highly tedious work.
[2029.24 → 2035.32] And of course, I mean, you could see that the objections to this, their mission statement from the beginning was don't be evil.
[2036.52 → 2039.64] Yeah, but that's nowhere in their documentation anymore, as far as I know.
[2040.44 → 2047.56] But it's still baked into the company ethos and a lot of people who work there make, it's possible that you worked there for a long time.
[2047.56 → 2051.48] And that was the mission statement when you were hired and for a large part of your career.
[2051.48 → 2062.36] Second part of it is that Google, it's been argued that Google has, is mandated to protect all of its users and they have a global user base.
[2062.36 → 2074.12] So this is, this project serves the interests of the US and the weaponry that's developed from it could be used to harm Google users who are not in the US.
[2074.12 → 2076.52] So where does their responsibility lie?
[2077.64 → 2078.36] This is great.
[2078.50 → 2083.98] Frontal in Twitch chat, deciding whether to kill someone equals highly tedious work.
[2086.48 → 2086.92] Dang.
[2087.34 → 2095.76] So there are other American companies, major tech companies, including IBM and Amazon that have refused to work with the US Defence Department.
[2099.36 → 2101.40] But the counterargument to that is...
[2101.40 → 2102.36] I don't think you read that correctly.
[2103.04 → 2103.78] Sorry, what's that?
[2104.12 → 2107.16] In addition to the petition circulating inside Google...
[2107.16 → 2108.32] Oh, launched the petition.
[2108.46 → 2108.60] Sorry.
[2108.72 → 2115.96] There was another petition that tried to get other companies like IBM and Amazon to work together to refuse to work with the US Defence Department.
[2115.96 → 2120.90] So the counterargument to that is like, well, don't you want the United...
[2120.90 → 2126.72] Don't you want America to, you know, keep up with, you know, other countries?
[2126.90 → 2128.24] Like, you know, is...
[2128.24 → 2134.10] It's like, do you think that the engineers at Baidu are quitting because they don't want to do defence contracts?
[2134.10 → 2135.30] From the Chinese government?
[2135.30 → 2137.14] Do you think that's happening?
[2137.14 → 2139.30] Do you think the engineers at Yandex in Russia?
[2139.30 → 2144.58] Do you want the U.S. to be overpowered by other nations that get this kind of work done?
[2144.66 → 2145.50] From the private sector.
[2146.34 → 2147.62] Well, private sector.
[2148.58 → 2151.26] I mean, is Baidu private sector technically?
[2151.40 → 2151.74] I don't know.
[2152.88 → 2153.88] Well, that's the other thing.
[2154.14 → 2155.74] What happens to you if you protest?
[2156.18 → 2157.12] I'm not even going there.
[2158.18 → 2164.78] So if it's going to be happening anyway, then who do you want to hold this kind of technology?
[2164.78 → 2177.16] I can see why you wouldn't want to be the one working on it, but you should probably understand that when you walk away, there's another engineer who's going to work on it.
[2177.88 → 2184.98] And then if that engineer's not at Google, that engineer will be either from a different company in the U.S. or another company in a different country.
[2185.24 → 2188.74] Baidu apparently not stayed owned as of this article from 2015.
[2188.96 → 2192.20] I don't know if that's up-to-date, but I was just curious.
[2192.20 → 2194.74] Oh, that's not what I thought you meant explicitly, but all right.
[2195.06 → 2195.86] All right.
[2195.98 → 2202.38] So let's move on then to YouTube Complete Dogs Breakfasting.
[2202.86 → 2203.36] Oh, sorry.
[2203.46 → 2203.94] Excuse me.
[2204.06 → 2205.06] YouTube Premium.
[2205.54 → 2207.92] So the original article here is from The Verge.
[2208.12 → 2210.94] And basically, so how much do you know about YouTube Red?
[2212.00 → 2212.80] Very little.
[2213.06 → 2213.30] Okay.
[2213.64 → 2222.76] So right now, okay, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to remember what YouTube music is.
[2223.26 → 2223.60] Oh, yeah.
[2223.88 → 2224.32] You're right.
[2224.78 → 2225.04] Crap.
[2225.18 → 2226.36] What is YouTube music?
[2227.40 → 2227.68] Oh, man.
[2227.68 → 2228.98] Google always does this.
[2229.30 → 2229.86] I know.
[2229.94 → 2231.08] It's so frustrating.
[2231.20 → 2231.36] Okay.
[2231.40 → 2231.64] No, no.
[2231.68 → 2232.64] So that one's coming soon.
[2233.12 → 2233.38] Okay.
[2233.78 → 2234.04] Okay.
[2234.24 → 2235.22] So Google.
[2235.68 → 2236.06] Okay.
[2236.12 → 2239.14] So on the Play Store, you can like to get music.
[2239.94 → 2240.38] Okay.
[2240.38 → 2240.48] Okay.
[2240.96 → 2242.40] But I think.
[2242.40 → 2248.70] I'm trying to remember all the different, like, whatever.
[2248.84 → 2250.56] Let's just go with how it was up until now.
[2250.68 → 2256.32] So Google Play Music lets you stream music and like download music to your device.
[2256.56 → 2256.82] Okay.
[2256.82 → 2258.38] It's like, I forget.
[2258.48 → 2260.20] It's like $10 a month or $8 a month.
[2260.44 → 2261.42] Or $15 for the family plan.
[2261.48 → 2262.26] But those are Canadian prices.
[2262.26 → 2263.66] So I have the family plan.
[2264.40 → 2268.44] And yeah, I pay like $15 Canadian or $16 Canadian or something like that.
[2269.44 → 2269.78] Okay.
[2269.78 → 2279.46] So then for a few US dollars more than Google Play Music, you can get YouTube Red, which strips the ads out of YouTube videos.
[2279.56 → 2282.58] That is the like the Google supplied, the AdSense supplied ads.
[2283.24 → 2286.20] And, and gives you access to Google Play Music.
[2286.50 → 2289.70] It also gives you additional benefits within the YouTube app.
[2289.74 → 2294.54] So the ability to play song videos, for example, with the screen off, with the phone in your pocket.
[2294.54 → 2295.58] Is this how it works now?
[2295.58 → 2299.74] Because I thought before it was like, if you bought Google Play Music, you just got YouTube Red.
[2301.10 → 2302.28] And I think it was the other way around.
[2302.44 → 2305.44] And I was, no, because I got music, and I was super stoked on that.
[2305.48 → 2307.72] And then I found out that wasn't in the that was not in Canada.
[2308.44 → 2309.38] I was like, ah.
[2309.56 → 2311.14] This whole thing has been so messy.
[2311.36 → 2311.68] Okay.
[2311.80 → 2314.42] Let's just, let's just, let's just do how it's going to work now.
[2314.44 → 2314.70] Okay.
[2314.82 → 2315.04] All right.
[2315.06 → 2316.98] So, so YouTube Red is gone.
[2317.48 → 2319.90] Apparently they were tired of being called Red Tube.
[2320.20 → 2321.30] No kidding, you idiots.
[2321.30 → 2321.66] Red.
[2321.78 → 2321.94] Yeah.
[2322.06 → 2322.66] I know.
[2322.66 → 2322.70] I know.
[2322.84 → 2322.92] Right.
[2323.02 → 2324.24] How could they have possibly.
[2324.24 → 2325.54] Red Tube has been around since like 2000.
[2325.58 → 2327.50] 2007 or something like that.
[2327.74 → 2327.82] No.
[2327.92 → 2328.50] Something like that.
[2328.50 → 2328.54] No.
[2328.62 → 2328.88] Look at him.
[2328.88 → 2330.60] Look at him covering, covering himself.
[2330.64 → 2332.28] No, because YouTube itself came out in 2007.
[2332.46 → 2333.34] So Red Tube must have been.
[2333.44 → 2334.72] No, YouTube was 2005.
[2335.04 → 2335.92] Let's find out.
[2336.32 → 2336.76] Okay.
[2336.96 → 2344.44] So YouTube Red is being replaced sort of by YouTube Premium, which gives you add free music,
[2345.06 → 2346.76] the ability to listen in the background.
[2346.88 → 2347.28] You're correct.
[2347.28 → 2348.28] And downloads.
[2348.28 → 2348.30] And downloads.
[2348.30 → 2348.36] And downloads.
[2349.16 → 2352.72] As well as ad free video, the ability to play in the background.
[2353.02 → 2353.86] This is cool.
[2354.94 → 2356.82] Downloads on YouTube videos.
[2357.32 → 2361.60] So you will now be able to load up YouTube videos on your phone before a flight or whatever.
[2362.34 → 2365.60] Slash not have to use one of those ripping tools when I want to rip something off.
[2366.90 → 2367.34] Sweet.
[2367.44 → 2368.74] I can finally get them in there.
[2369.08 → 2369.30] Native.
[2369.30 → 2370.74] You mean compensate the artist?
[2370.92 → 2371.76] Is that what you mean?
[2371.86 → 2372.06] Anyway.
[2372.06 → 2374.82] Also, all YouTube Originals.
[2375.36 → 2380.66] So YouTube Red Originals or whatever they were calling those are now just called YouTube Originals.
[2381.68 → 2387.06] And then YouTube Music Premium for just $2 less.
[2387.14 → 2390.84] So this is like a pretty terrible deal as far as I can tell.
[2391.26 → 2393.36] Just gives you add free music.
[2393.80 → 2396.02] So other videos will have ads.
[2396.22 → 2400.00] And the ability to listen in the background and download music specifically.
[2400.00 → 2404.78] And then how Google Play Music figures into all of this, I can't remember.
[2404.92 → 2405.40] Yes, right.
[2405.58 → 2410.40] If you have a Google Play Music subscription, you get YouTube Music as part of that membership.
[2411.20 → 2415.04] Play Music is not going away yet, but it'll be hard.
[2415.28 → 2415.86] Play Music?
[2416.00 → 2416.18] God damn.
[2416.20 → 2416.72] What's that?
[2420.46 → 2424.48] In other news, YouTube Premium is finally coming to Canada.
[2424.48 → 2428.42] So I plan to get it immediately because I am so tired.
[2428.42 → 2429.50] So the editors can rip off.
[2429.62 → 2431.36] I am so tired.
[2431.70 → 2432.80] No, it's nothing to do with that.
[2432.98 → 2437.74] It's because YouTube forces me to break their own terms of service every day.
[2438.60 → 2439.22] What do you mean?
[2439.38 → 2452.20] Because you are not allowed, according to Google's terms of service, to watch your own ads or interact with your own ads because it inflates your viewership numbers.
[2452.20 → 2456.40] It's like being an Amazon affiliate and getting your friends to buy the thing you're an affiliate for.
[2456.48 → 2457.20] No, that's fine.
[2457.62 → 2458.30] No, you can't do that.
[2459.20 → 2459.86] You can't?
[2460.26 → 2460.46] No.
[2461.06 → 2465.04] I can't be like, hey, guys, here's my affiliate link to buy this t-shirt.
[2465.38 → 2467.74] All my friends and family, if you're going to buy this t-shirt, use my link.
[2467.86 → 2468.38] You can't do that.
[2468.96 → 2470.18] Oh, I see what you mean.
[2470.24 → 2470.40] Okay.
[2470.48 → 2478.36] Well, I think it's a little bit different from that because it's like actually like it's a holdover from the days of click fraud.
[2478.36 → 2485.94] Where written websites would have banners up on their sites, and then they'd like just click on their own ads all day.
[2486.00 → 2486.18] Yeah.
[2486.30 → 2488.10] So that they could get a bunch of money.
[2488.24 → 2490.00] But no one ever actually looked at that.
[2490.16 → 2495.76] So anytime I watch a video, like an unskippable video, unskippable ad, for example, might show up.
[2495.76 → 2503.14] And then I sit through it, I have effectively fraudulently given an impression to that video.
[2503.24 → 2505.94] Don't they know the IP of the uploader?
[2506.00 → 2510.50] But if they know that, and no, it's a little more complicated than that because I could be using a different device.
[2510.68 → 2512.38] But we're talking when I'm logged in.
[2512.38 → 2515.76] So I've been asking Google for this for ages.
[2515.98 → 2520.86] When I'm logged in, don't serve an ad on my video.
[2521.52 → 2524.50] But they cannot figure this out.
[2524.68 → 2525.96] Or they just don't care.
[2526.14 → 2528.10] The second one is a more likely one.
[2528.50 → 2535.20] So finally, I won't have to break Google's terms of service just by being a YouTuber.
[2535.46 → 2536.14] And that's wonderful.
[2536.36 → 2537.50] That makes my heart fuzzy.
[2537.50 → 2545.04] They're like, stop, we all know you use Ad blocker.
[2545.14 → 2545.92] No, I don't.
[2549.10 → 2549.76] All right.
[2550.18 → 2552.02] So what else do we have today?
[2552.06 → 2552.96] Do we have anything interesting?
[2553.64 → 2554.50] Oh, yeah.
[2554.66 → 2554.80] Okay.
[2554.80 → 2562.26] So for anyone who was sort of speculating that maybe Asus really wanted to do the Ares brand.
[2564.72 → 2566.14] No, they did not.
[2566.14 → 2574.76] But as of now, now that GeForce partner program is officially dead, Ares is gone.
[2574.94 → 2576.02] DOG is back.
[2576.56 → 2577.40] So that's good.
[2577.52 → 2578.74] Glad that's all behind us.
[2578.84 → 2579.14] Do you think that's conclusive?
[2580.16 → 2580.60] Yeah.
[2581.50 → 2582.74] Do you think there's going to...
[2582.74 → 2586.44] Are there any Ares cards out there?
[2587.60 → 2588.94] This could be like a Lara bee thing.
[2589.04 → 2590.42] If we can get our hands on one, that'd be cool.
[2590.58 → 2591.26] I don't think so.
[2591.46 → 2591.84] I doubt it.
[2591.84 → 2594.82] If there's an employee out there who has one, that'd be really cool to get our hands on that.
[2596.14 → 2597.56] All right.
[2597.62 → 2600.82] According to WCCF text, it was posted by Black Up on the forum.
[2600.94 → 2603.30] We've got rumours of a GTX 1170.
[2603.44 → 2604.06] Black Up.
[2604.32 → 2605.06] No, it's Buck Up.
[2605.26 → 2605.40] Oh, Buck Up.
[2605.56 → 2606.20] It's Buck Up.
[2606.24 → 2607.60] Oh, Buck Up.
[2607.74 → 2608.52] You need to Buck Up.
[2608.60 → 2609.08] Oh, sorry.
[2609.42 → 2609.82] I don't know.
[2610.32 → 2610.98] Black Up.
[2611.06 → 2611.28] Look.
[2612.64 → 2614.18] I come from...
[2614.18 → 2616.28] A home covered in Black Up.
[2616.28 → 2619.18] I come from eight time zones away right now.
[2619.78 → 2624.76] I landed back in this country like 24 hours ago.
[2624.78 → 2627.04] How do you think the people who are still in that time zone feel?
[2627.80 → 2635.68] So, according to the leaks, the GTX 1170 will be powered by a 104 class GPU codename GT 104.
[2636.12 → 2636.92] What would T be?
[2637.84 → 2638.78] So, it's not Volta.
[2638.92 → 2639.80] What was it?
[2639.80 → 2644.52] Oh, I don't remember what the rumoured T codename was going to be.
[2644.82 → 2646.96] It'll be approximately 400 millimetres square.
[2647.08 → 2648.14] So, that's a pretty big chip.
[2648.40 → 2648.58] Okay.
[2648.72 → 2649.12] Wasn't that testable?
[2649.50 → 2653.70] 2688 CUBA cores, 256-bit GDDR6 memory interface.
[2654.46 → 2657.00] 8 to 16 gigs of GDDR6 memory.
[2657.16 → 2660.04] Well, that's good that it has an interface that matches the amount of...
[2660.04 → 2662.02] Or the type of memory it's rumoured to have.
[2662.12 → 2664.82] So, the rumour managed to get hopefully at least that much right.
[2664.82 → 2668.86] Clocks of 1.5 to 1.8 gigahertz depending on boost.
[2671.18 → 2675.26] So, this would put it in the same league as the existing GTX 1080 Ti.
[2676.00 → 2679.82] So, once again, if you invested...
[2680.72 → 2680.90] Ha!
[2682.06 → 2683.26] Invested because of crypto.
[2683.50 → 2683.72] Ha ha!
[2684.34 → 2685.92] If you invested...
[2685.92 → 2686.52] Not invested.
[2686.64 → 2690.92] If you plunked down the money for a top tier card, a top tier Ti card,
[2690.92 → 2694.98] you are once again going to have to wait two generations
[2694.98 → 2698.54] in order to get any kind of significant upgrade from NVIDIA.
[2698.74 → 2705.24] So, we've seen this a lot of times now where the GTX 680 Ti was the last time they...
[2706.00 → 2707.54] Was it the 680 Ti?
[2709.32 → 2709.88] Yeah.
[2710.62 → 2711.98] But wait, GTX 680?
[2712.02 → 2713.14] No, they never did a 680 Ti.
[2713.24 → 2716.68] So, the GTX 680 was the top tier of that generation.
[2716.68 → 2722.98] And then, in the next gen, there was a 770 that was exactly the same thing.
[2723.48 → 2723.68] And then...
[2724.36 → 2724.68] No, 780...
[2725.50 → 2727.32] Maybe it's 700 series that I'm thinking of.
[2727.36 → 2728.40] So, 700 series...
[2728.40 → 2732.58] Yeah, then you've got a 980 that didn't...
[2732.58 → 2734.08] Then the 980 Ti didn't come until later.
[2734.14 → 2734.46] That's right.
[2734.76 → 2738.60] So, 780 Ti was very similar in performance to the GTX 980.
[2738.92 → 2742.22] So, when the 900 series rolled around, if you had a top tier card,
[2742.22 → 2746.82] there was basically no upgrade for you until the 980 Ti came...
[2746.82 → 2747.22] Or the...
[2747.76 → 2750.14] Yeah, the 980 Ti came quite some time later.
[2750.34 → 2754.58] Then the 980 Ti was actually quite similar to a 1070 or 1080.
[2754.76 → 2758.18] So, there wasn't much of an upgrade there until the 1080 Ti came quite a bit later.
[2758.28 → 2762.54] So, you actually have to kind of wait at least a half generation in order to get an upgrade
[2762.54 → 2765.04] if you bought the top tier card from last time around.
[2765.50 → 2769.56] So, that combined with the fact that the 10 series launched...
[2769.56 → 2771.18] Like, when did the 10 series launch?
[2771.18 → 2772.94] So, GTX 10...
[2772.94 → 2774.38] When did the 1080 Ti launch?
[2774.52 → 2775.26] Let's find out.
[2775.50 → 2775.90] The Ti?
[2776.48 → 2776.78] Yeah.
[2777.34 → 2780.50] So, that was back in March 2017.
[2780.82 → 2781.98] So, it's been a full year.
[2782.24 → 2785.62] You will still have no upgrade path from that.
[2787.90 → 2795.16] So, the only people who will be upgrading are probably people who bought 1080s or before.
[2795.58 → 2798.48] So, that was way back in May 2016.
[2798.48 → 2804.22] People who bought 1080s and who have been waiting for a significant upgrade at that same price tier.
[2805.36 → 2808.56] And we actually don't even know anything about pricing because while the crypto...
[2808.56 → 2811.90] No, there is one tidbit about the pricing here.
[2812.04 → 2812.38] Oh, okay.
[2812.76 → 2814.62] And that it's going to cost more than it did last generation.
[2814.84 → 2815.02] Oh.
[2815.14 → 2815.76] 500 bucks.
[2815.98 → 2816.28] Sure.
[2816.52 → 2818.42] That's what is being guessed, apparently.
[2818.94 → 2820.44] For the 1170 specifically.
[2820.44 → 2822.66] All right.
[2823.06 → 2824.44] And that's a super rumour.
[2824.60 → 2827.56] That's just like whispers around the industry indicate.
[2828.62 → 2828.86] Yeah.
[2829.20 → 2830.92] NVIDIA has been known to mislead people.
[2831.08 → 2832.50] Like, I still remember there was a launch.
[2832.58 → 2837.66] It might have been the 580 or something like that where they literally changed the pricing on us the day before.
[2838.14 → 2839.30] And like, no one knew.
[2839.46 → 2840.28] Their own partners.
[2840.40 → 2841.44] By a lot or by like 20 bucks?
[2841.44 → 2843.40] That was like by $100 or something like that.
[2843.46 → 2844.14] It was pretty significant.
[2844.42 → 2844.88] Up or down?
[2845.66 → 2846.06] Down.
[2846.62 → 2846.98] Yeah.
[2847.30 → 2847.56] Yeah.
[2847.64 → 2848.54] Can't complain though, right?
[2848.56 → 2849.72] Yeah, that's old news though.
[2849.80 → 2852.50] NVIDIA like surprising the industry with great pricing.
[2852.68 → 2853.60] That's not a thing anymore.
[2854.74 → 2856.38] SC2 Mitch posted this one on the forum.
[2856.50 → 2860.26] This was originally posted on InsideGames.biz.
[2860.26 → 2865.16] And I have to say, this shouldn't surprise me, but it does.
[2865.50 → 2867.40] It shouldn't because it's been on the WAN show before.
[2868.34 → 2869.32] Well, whatever.
[2869.44 → 2871.62] I probably skipped it because I was like, oh, that's boring.
[2871.76 → 2878.60] So, the IOC is to host an esports Summit in whatever, however you pronounce that, Lausanne?
[2879.52 → 2880.04] Lausanne?
[2880.54 → 2881.36] In July.
[2881.90 → 2883.14] You're supposed to be a French speaker.
[2883.92 → 2884.68] Oh, is it French?
[2885.32 → 2885.90] It's in Switzerland.
[2885.90 → 2893.12] All right, so basically this is just to continue the organization's dialogue with the gaming industry.
[2893.28 → 2894.44] It's just a one-day meeting.
[2896.06 → 2902.74] And in due course, approach the stakeholders of the Olympic movement again.
[2904.14 → 2904.94] Never going to happen, man.
[2905.00 → 2907.34] esports will never be in the Olympics.
[2907.50 → 2910.30] And I argue that they don't belong in the Olympics.
[2911.14 → 2912.36] I'm not going to disagree with you.
[2912.38 → 2915.72] I'm not even going to play devil's advocate here because I don't think it makes a ton of sense.
[2915.72 → 2920.82] But with that said, there is stuff in the Olympics that I don't necessarily think belongs in the Olympics.
[2922.52 → 2922.88] Sure.
[2923.26 → 2923.34] So...
[2923.34 → 2923.94] There's...
[2923.94 → 2925.44] I mean, here.
[2925.54 → 2925.88] You know what?
[2925.92 → 2926.88] Let's bring up the full list.
[2927.10 → 2927.92] The speed walking and stuff?
[2928.44 → 2928.76] Olympics.
[2929.14 → 2930.10] I mean, this stuff's hard.
[2930.14 → 2931.96] But the point is that it's athletic.
[2932.30 → 2939.32] The way I look at it is in athletics, there's something you intend to do.
[2939.40 → 2940.98] There's an action you want to carry out.
[2940.98 → 2942.40] You see that action in your mind.
[2942.82 → 2951.06] And then because your body has crappy tolerances, even though you want to throw that ball into that particular spot, you just can't do it.
[2951.14 → 2953.34] But in a video game, for the most part, you can.
[2953.64 → 2955.50] You want your units to move right there.
[2955.70 → 2957.00] You click there and they move there.
[2957.00 → 2963.76] So I think the fact that there are greater tolerances that you don't have much control over on your own body, that's what really separates.
[2963.92 → 2970.56] I mean, you could make the argument that moving the mouse very precisely is a pretty good analog for that.
[2971.46 → 2971.80] Sure.
[2971.94 → 2974.70] But that's only a part of the game and not the whole game.
[2975.58 → 2978.62] There are actually a lot fewer Olympic events than I thought.
[2978.68 → 2979.78] Actually, most of these aren't that stupid.
[2979.80 → 2980.46] That's winter, though.
[2980.74 → 2981.00] No, no.
[2981.04 → 2981.60] I got both of them.
[2981.62 → 2981.88] Okay.
[2982.50 → 2982.76] Okay.
[2982.96 → 2983.36] Handball.
[2983.44 → 2984.16] Are you going to put that on the screen?
[2984.34 → 2984.62] Really?
[2984.84 → 2985.20] Handball?
[2985.20 → 2987.00] Handball is huge in Europe, man.
[2987.04 → 2988.54] There's a bunch of people yelling at you right now.
[2989.50 → 2989.86] Huge.
[2990.50 → 2991.80] And it's pretty BA, too.
[2993.34 → 2993.70] All right.
[2993.74 → 2994.32] Well, then, fine.
[2994.50 → 3000.06] So is there anything here that we really think is pretty dumb?
[3000.72 → 3001.12] Football.
[3001.22 → 3002.04] That guy's kicking the ball.
[3002.08 → 3002.78] It doesn't make any sense.
[3003.48 → 3003.88] Joking.
[3005.96 → 3006.32] Joking.
[3007.24 → 3007.60] Terrible.
[3007.82 → 3008.18] Equestrian.
[3008.26 → 3008.86] That's kind of weird.
[3009.74 → 3010.92] What is dressage?
[3011.26 → 3011.82] A dressage.
[3012.02 → 3012.54] A dressage.
[3012.54 → 3014.50] It's like fancy walking on horses.
[3015.20 → 3016.62] It's...
[3016.62 → 3019.50] But again, this is like the horse...
[3019.50 → 3021.86] I guess there's skill in training a horse.
[3023.80 → 3028.96] And I'm sure there's skill as a rider, but you're telling me that if your rider gets hurt
[3028.96 → 3031.90] that day, and you still got the good horse, you're not going to just send someone else
[3031.90 → 3033.60] on top of that good horse and still maybe win?
[3034.34 → 3036.04] I don't know anything about this sport.
[3036.84 → 3037.16] Okay.
[3037.16 → 3042.62] Here's another angle that John Martin here, the writer of Tech Quickie, told me when we
[3042.62 → 3043.94] discussed this all those months ago.
[3044.40 → 3045.54] Or maybe it was someone on the forum.
[3045.62 → 3051.66] They basically said an interesting angle is the fact that video games are commercial products.
[3052.12 → 3055.24] So you're going to go on to the Olympics, and you're going to broadcast something that
[3055.24 → 3057.82] Blizzard owns, for example.
[3057.82 → 3060.34] So you think there's a potential licensing issue here?
[3061.04 → 3065.48] Or just like the IOC wanting to be paid ultimately?
[3066.60 → 3070.62] Maybe that someone wanting to get paid or at least it being free advertising.
[3071.12 → 3071.40] Right.
[3071.50 → 3072.12] It's bizarre.
[3072.28 → 3075.82] And then there's another quote here that says that they're not going to do anything...
[3076.82 → 3079.54] They said killer games, but the guy has an accent.
[3079.96 → 3081.44] But violent games.
[3081.58 → 3083.02] And that's like half the games.
[3083.54 → 3085.82] Half the competitive ones, especially.
[3085.82 → 3090.30] Yeah, like what games are competitive that don't involve killing?
[3091.28 → 3094.74] I mean, I guess like Data is a lot better than Call of Duty.
[3095.98 → 3096.62] Or CSGO.
[3096.62 → 3097.24] Yeah, okay.
[3097.24 → 3098.80] It's like cartoon or something, but...
[3098.80 → 3099.64] That's a fair point.
[3099.74 → 3101.48] And you resurrect or something.
[3101.74 → 3103.70] You're not going to watch Civilization VI in the Olympics.
[3104.60 → 3105.04] Yeah.
[3106.82 → 3107.82] I mean...
[3107.82 → 3109.56] All right.
[3111.22 → 3111.96] They're games.
[3112.04 → 3112.56] They're not sports.
[3113.78 → 3115.16] I don't want to see them there.
[3115.16 → 3115.80] Oh, man.
[3116.24 → 3118.58] So, like there's stuff that you could...
[3118.58 → 3119.10] Like shooting.
[3119.60 → 3120.84] Is shooting a sport then?
[3121.34 → 3121.68] Why not?
[3121.68 → 3122.06] Or is it a game?
[3122.76 → 3123.06] What?
[3124.80 → 3125.38] Why not?
[3125.90 → 3127.24] Well, like shooting a target.
[3127.68 → 3128.58] It's super physical.
[3128.60 → 3129.68] Or like archery.
[3131.16 → 3132.38] Where's your argument that it's not?
[3132.82 → 3133.46] Well, okay.
[3133.54 → 3134.42] Games are in the mind.
[3134.66 → 3135.78] You think games are in the mind?
[3135.80 → 3136.30] They're in the mind.
[3136.42 → 3137.80] Chess is a quintessential game.
[3137.80 → 3141.06] You compute what you want to happen.
[3141.06 → 3144.54] And the action of carrying out that task is a non-issue.
[3144.60 → 3145.70] You just pick it up and put it there.
[3146.18 → 3147.30] That's not the hard part of the game.
[3147.42 → 3149.44] It's the computation that's the hard part of the game.
[3149.66 → 3152.16] In sports, it's the carrying out of the task that's difficult.
[3152.16 → 3154.06] Everybody wants to get the ball across the line.
[3154.44 → 3155.52] Doing that is hard.
[3155.52 → 3161.98] I would argue that video games sit in between, though.
[3162.30 → 3162.72] I agree.
[3162.84 → 3164.36] Like in a very good area.
[3164.88 → 3165.54] I agree with that.
[3165.66 → 3166.70] But you say it'll never happen.
[3166.76 → 3168.34] I think they're way closer to the game end.
[3168.56 → 3173.24] I'm sure Twitch chat is hitting us up with some games that don't have killing.
[3173.36 → 3174.38] Okay, Rocket League.
[3175.44 → 3175.86] I can't.
[3176.12 → 3177.58] Rocket League is just soccer.
[3178.72 → 3184.00] Yeah, I can't imagine watching Rocket League in the Olympics.
[3184.00 → 3186.12] I just, like, oh, man.
[3186.84 → 3188.54] I have a hard time.
[3189.04 → 3190.84] Like, it's such a ridiculous concept.
[3190.98 → 3197.50] I think these cars running around and, like, using their butts to hit a giant ball into a thing.
[3197.64 → 3197.98] Like, I just.
[3198.18 → 3203.22] You know what you're hitting on right now is the level of abstraction with video games compared to the real sports.
[3203.32 → 3204.66] Because what happens?
[3204.72 → 3206.90] Everyone has the common experience when the Olympics come on.
[3207.02 → 3207.50] Street Fighter.
[3207.76 → 3208.00] Okay.
[3208.42 → 3209.96] Super Smash is another one.
[3210.00 → 3210.32] That'd be great.
[3210.36 → 3211.16] Street Fighter and Smash.
[3211.26 → 3211.40] Okay.
[3211.70 → 3211.92] Okay.
[3211.92 → 3212.78] The Olympics come on.
[3212.86 → 3213.86] You've never watched pole-vaulting.
[3213.86 → 3214.58] In your life.
[3214.70 → 3216.08] You've never watched the sport in your life.
[3216.22 → 3218.34] But you're sitting there, and you just instantly get it.
[3218.46 → 3220.32] You can appreciate when someone does a good job.
[3220.38 → 3221.70] You're like, that was amazing.
[3222.00 → 3222.18] Yeah.
[3222.30 → 3223.64] That will never happen with esports.
[3223.76 → 3225.38] Someone puts on a Star Craft II match.
[3226.02 → 3229.00] You don't know that they have all these battle cruises.
[3229.12 → 3230.66] You're just like, oh, that guy has ships.
[3230.90 → 3231.22] Okay.
[3231.70 → 3235.38] Like, it's too abstracted from a visceral feeling that we can all share.
[3235.48 → 3235.66] Yeah.
[3235.66 → 3236.90] I agree with you.
[3237.02 → 3240.56] I think it's far more likely that they'll just make their own Olympics.
[3240.96 → 3241.34] I agree.
[3241.34 → 3241.86] With blackjack.
[3241.88 → 3242.50] They should have that.
[3243.50 → 3244.80] Well, we all know the next line.
[3244.92 → 3245.04] Yeah.
[3245.72 → 3247.96] Close friends that you pay to hang out with you.
[3248.50 → 3248.86] Employees.
[3249.22 → 3249.46] Hey.
[3249.96 → 3250.64] Friends of the night.
[3250.64 → 3251.26] I've got those.
[3251.78 → 3252.40] I'm out of here.
[3252.72 → 3253.10] All right.
[3253.10 → 3256.70] So, I think that's pretty much it for the WAN show today.
[3256.80 → 3258.16] We will see you guys again next week.
[3258.38 → 3259.98] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3260.64 → 3261.22] Let's roll that intro.
[3261.22 → 3262.20] No guarantee on the time.
[3262.28 → 3262.92] Don't talk on the intro.
[3262.92 → 3263.68] I'm going to talk on the intro.
[3263.68 → 3264.22] Don't talk during the...
[3264.22 → 3267.30] Never going to give you up.
[3267.30 → 3268.02] No, no, no.
[3268.32 → 3269.62] I can sing on the intro.
[3270.70 → 3271.12] All right.
[3271.16 → 3271.42] Fine.
[3271.68 → 3275.10] Never going to turn around to zero you.
[3277.36 → 3278.74] How weird is that guy's voice, though?
[3283.10 → 3284.70] Yeah, this guy was talking to me.
