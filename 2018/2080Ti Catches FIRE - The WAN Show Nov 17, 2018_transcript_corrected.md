[0.00 → 10.38] live ah we're technically still late that's my fault we're only three minutes late I want to
[10.38 → 14.52] get the thumbnail done so it looks all pretty on YouTube and stuff when you guys want to join
[14.52 → 19.58] we're going to have some pretty interesting news this week including literally fire yes someone
[19.58 → 29.64] early adopted a 2080 ti, and it caught fire that's reasonable yeah it's just so it's its so hot right
[29.64 → 35.26] now it's just it's so it's lit yeah people are like oh my god I might be able to use part of its
[35.26 → 42.18] functionality soon whoa well more on that actually yeah updates there too and Amazon is gonna start
[42.18 → 50.44] selling iPhones and crack down on the resale markets only authorized resellers of Apple devices on Amazon
[50.44 → 55.52] this is huge that is pretty huge, and it's probably why apple is going to be selling stuff on Amazon
[55.52 → 61.14] oh yes oh that was a that was an agreement that happened yes we'll get into that valve is
[61.14 → 68.50] potentially working on a half-life 2 prequels for VR we're going the other direction not all the way
[68.50 → 76.14] though not all interestingly yeah yes yeah anyway roll the intro oh yeah no more news for you that's
[76.14 → 78.14] you'll see you'll see
[78.14 → 80.14] paddle paddle paddle
[80.14 → 82.14] you
[106.14 → 111.10] wow that actually like was rough on my voice a little bit all right hi there we go hey how
[111.10 → 115.90] are you doing last week you were in the USN day I was gone I was in Chicago what were you doing
[115.90 → 123.40] there you know you hear like kind of scary things about Chicago windy lots of what's it talking about
[123.40 → 129.60] the wind lots of gun crime and stuff okay it's a really nice city it was beautiful I really enjoyed my time
[129.60 → 134.64] it was great this guy with a gun once this guy with a gun's like here let me get the door for you
[134.64 → 142.28] oh yeah it's great that would have been delightful um anyway yeah it was fun I've been good how are
[142.28 → 148.62] you oh yeah I'm good I was in USN day also oh went to oh yeah yeah we went to la how was that it was
[148.62 → 153.84] fun we talked to the YouTube people, and we ripped around on those uh little scoots those lime
[153.84 → 159.50] scooters it's like the Uber scoober they should have called it scooter they definitely should
[159.50 → 163.46] call it scooter I be tuber needs to make a scooter division they probably already yeah
[163.46 → 168.10] uh that should don't they have a scooter thing are they invested in and abandoned if it's been in the
[168.10 → 172.64] headlines I have neglected to click I have not a clue, but they're sweet, and they're pretty cheap
[172.64 → 180.10] and fast and you sometimes people double on them as I doubled ed it's pretty fun oh like oh okay, okay
[180.10 → 186.96] for some reason my immediate imagination went to one foot on each just flying wait two scooters yeah and
[186.96 → 191.94] you're split leg I thought okay that's weird I thought you were going to say someone riding on the
[191.94 → 197.04] handlebars oh which is where you steal that would be really hard yeah really hard you have to be a very
[197.04 → 202.04] small person you have to lean back kick the weight on that back wheel yeah in any case that uh that's
[202.04 → 208.16] all ridiculous speaking of keeping weight on the back wheel uh 2080 ti has caught fire this was posted
[208.16 → 214.90] by tech dreamer on the forum a hard OCP user claims to have been browsing the web like not even pushing it
[214.90 → 220.92] hard no he might have had GPU activated browsing but like that's that's very, very low like so like
[220.92 → 225.44] it wasn't necessarily at zero but like it was very, very low, or he was folding at home
[225.44 → 230.56] maybe that's true folding at home heck yeah check it out on the forum yeah we're doing that this
[230.56 → 236.88] month everybody get on it yeah yeah are you doing that by the way I'm not currently at home uh
[236.88 → 242.96] I can, you have a computer I've barely been at home yeah but the thing with folding at home is you just
[242.96 → 249.22] set it and forget it yes I haven't had time to set it is takes two seconds and I'm a noob and actually
[249.22 → 254.46] the setup's he's going to get on their guys I will get on there, and you should too it's a very conflicting
[254.46 → 257.46] situation because my computer is a work computer
[257.46 → 258.54] ah
[258.54 → 260.08] uh
[260.08 → 262.84] so I would like need to get that approved
[262.84 → 270.48] okay I think okay like last week or the week before Jake got on there and I think he did it with a work computer
[270.48 → 277.12] okay but like you're using home electricity yes so like yeah you're mining out the components a bit
[277.12 → 281.14] but if you don't run them that hard like that shouldn't be that bad
[281.14 → 284.92] and it's your electricity you're paying for so it's not like you're costing the company money
[284.92 → 291.00] yeah so I think your good bud as long as he's okay with the burnout which again there shouldn't be much
[291.00 → 298.40] as long as they're not hot yeah do medium I'm only running on medium how much how hard does medium hit it
[298.40 → 302.86] just so because there's probably some people in the audience that are interested in helping uh I think
[302.86 → 310.10] on my system I was how hot like 70s yeah okay so that's not bad so like I was on high I was like in the high 80s I was like
[310.10 → 314.56] yeah that's maybe not great yeah because it's long you can also undervolt a little bit
[314.56 → 320.46] I'm not doing that okay I hit this little slider if you're is you're worried about the longevity of
[320.46 → 325.96] your card actually a lot of cards can be undervoted and overclocked, and it's still fine
[325.96 → 332.74] um so you can check that out see if you can do that and go for medium or maybe even low
[332.74 → 336.06] whatever just make sure your card isn't getting super hot, and you're probably okay
[336.06 → 342.14] um if you don't know what we're talking about you can lend your computer to help research really cool
[342.14 → 346.60] causes like Alzheimer's research and stuff like that, and it doesn't take any effort from you which
[346.60 → 351.32] is great so check it out there's a big thing all month we're doing it but uh anyway this guy might
[351.32 → 354.98] have been doing that if you do it for the month, and then you're like this is really cool but i
[354.98 → 359.94] want to do other stuff as well you can check out that same forum on our forum the same forum section
[359.94 → 363.94] and there should be information on brink and brink has like a bunch of different projects you can join
[363.94 → 369.26] okay folding is a little bit more targeted okay brink you can more select kind of what you're
[369.26 → 374.56] working on um they're both super cool folding is bigger as far as I know okay yeah there's a ton
[374.56 → 379.36] of teams there's like yeah I look at the leaderboard there's a team that's just called team Taiwan I'm
[379.36 → 385.32] like how many people are like they just went on the news we're like all right everybody we're joining
[385.32 → 389.86] together you're getting a tax break if you do this that'd be awesome yeah um yeah folding at home check
[389.86 → 395.68] it out so this guy was maybe folding at home but all we know he's browsing the web he's not maxing
[395.68 → 401.78] on his card he's not gaming the card's not overclocked as far as we know he doesn't have a faulty CPU or
[401.78 → 408.00] I mean PSU power supply and suddenly his computer just unexpectedly shuts down he goes to investigate
[408.00 → 416.14] by looking through the side panel and there's fire shooting out the back of his card oh my goodness
[416.14 → 426.54] yeah it's not fun that's not fun we've had a lot of reports and I know gamers nexus is looking into
[426.54 → 430.48] this i again I haven't been on my computer a ton I'm not sure if they've finished their investigation
[430.48 → 435.10] but I know they've been looking they've been collecting dead 1080 eyes yeah and trying to
[435.10 → 440.28] figure out why they died how they died stuff like that I think this is the only straight-up fire five
[440.28 → 444.52] that's what I was going to say is this is the only one I've heard of that's fire I know a lot of them
[444.52 → 450.50] have died I don't think a lot of them have like catastrophically gone out and gone out in flames
[450.50 → 457.30] in flames yeah exactly um, so this is this one's a little bit more spectacular than uh than most we've
[457.30 → 462.70] we've run into do you have any idea of whether this would be covered by warranty oh i you
[462.70 → 467.86] would hope I think it would be because I've seen some posts saying all this that's kind of stuff's
[467.86 → 473.24] normally not covered and I've seen counter posts saying no, no I had a similar thing happen to me
[473.24 → 479.42] when my GP went up in flames oh boy, and it was a MSI one they got covered and then there's also
[479.42 → 484.70] some questions as they might look into the like were you super aggressively overclocking it
[484.70 → 491.60] if he changed the bios on here I'm sure he's screwed um do you think it's an VGA warranty thing
[491.60 → 498.40] or is it is would go back it would go back to VGA and then I guess you'd have to see what VGA
[498.40 → 503.84] thought about it, but it's not the chip it's the board right and like what kind of card is if it's
[503.84 → 512.76] a t-i-x-c sounds like it's probably an VGA related problem oh I'm going to guess because if that's not
[512.76 → 520.58] a reference board that might be something that VGA did I have no idea I'm talking out of my butt
[520.58 → 526.02] right now it's butt talk uh welcome to the butt show yeah I'm not I'm not super familiar with this
[526.02 → 529.98] individual card but if that's a non-reference board and that is a non-reference part of the
[529.98 → 536.94] non-reference board uh then yeah I would contact VGA honestly I've had very few computer components
[536.94 → 542.74] fail on me um and this wasn't even a case where a computer component failed I just called VGA
[542.74 → 546.44] freaked out it's a long story so I'm not going to go into it um I've talked about it on my show before
[546.44 → 551.86] uh, but their customer service was freaking wonderful so I'm sure this dude will be taken care of
[551.86 → 557.92] um should be okay cool you were talking about other details um
[557.92 → 566.52] I was like you're saying he was like there or something who was where the kid was there oh
[566.52 → 571.20] yeah there was uh in his original thread here he says that he was a little freaked out because his
[571.20 → 577.48] child was like nearby physically close to uh the computer tower when it was happening so
[577.48 → 583.82] scared the bleep out of me since my kid was right around it when it started to shoot flame
[583.82 → 589.36] haven't tried to turn the pc back on yeah okay that's probably a decent idea um
[589.36 → 595.68] so apparently everything was in its stock form so I'm going to assume he
[595.68 → 600.66] um never even opened it before what
[600.66 → 610.12] what are you talking about okay he said I was just doing some web browsing wasn't even doing
[610.12 → 613.52] anything else at the time so he probably wasn't folding he probably wasn't playing a game in the
[613.52 → 621.88] background whatever everything in its stock form never even opened it before um is it a pre-built
[621.88 → 627.14] are there even pre-built that have 2080 tis in them right now
[627.14 → 632.96] well I'm sure you could get something from like main gear origin any of those guys
[632.96 → 635.98] what does chat think
[635.98 → 646.74] the card itself I think opened it, but it's kind of like he never opened it up but like yes
[646.74 → 650.56] it's a weird thing to say
[650.56 → 656.88] segue speaking of weird things
[656.88 → 663.54] or things that also are smoldering in fire there's a new agreement between Amazon and apple
[663.54 → 669.20] where shoppers will soon see a selection of the latest apple products on amazon.com
[669.20 → 676.78] now correct me if I'm wrong, but historically you can only buy iPhones from apple like apple.com or apple
[676.78 → 706.76] or uh apple like or like if you're going to go to like T-Mobile kiosk style stores so, so yeah okay that's an interesting one yeah if you go to a cell phone like a cellular provider yeah you might have it, but best buys would have like apple sections of their stores right there would usually be an apple representative there even though you could be helped by for online sales was it always just apple.com okay uh honestly not enough of a mac fanboy to care so I never knew pretty sure
[706.76 → 712.88] uh but yeah as far as I know anyway you'll be able to buy them now on Amazon and this has some serious implications
[712.88 → 716.50] that's pretty huge especially for the resale for like the refurbished ones
[716.50 → 733.44] so okay let's just go through this here currently many apple products are only available on Amazon through third-party resellers and their prices and conditions vary wildly and that's not apple's way sorry someone in the thing is like he paid for he paid for special effects, and he got them they're talking about the graphics card
[733.44 → 740.20] so it's like that that is the best version of RTX you could ever ask for the lighting off of that fire was probably perfect
[740.20 → 746.10] oh yeah the reflections on the tempered glass yeah they were hyperreal you could feel it the heat
[746.10 → 751.82] yeah, yeah sorry, sorry keep going apple likes to control all the products right that's why they have authorized resellers and everything
[751.82 → 762.10] they don't want you to go one bay and buy a random like the conditions that are they don't want you buying them from other people they don't want you repairing them etc they want to control the pipeline
[762.10 → 770.12] as much as possible so now uh currently today there are resellers there are all sorts of people on the Amazon Marketplace that are selling
[770.12 → 780.46] different apple products in various conditions, but that will not be the case going forward because the deal will limit resellers of apple and beats products to those authorized by apple
[780.46 → 788.36] independent sellers of apple products will have their listings that may be online right now removed after January 4th 2019
[788.36 → 797.12] that's pretty soon yeah that's potentially ripping an entire business that could be your livelihood oh yeah 100, and it is for lots and lots of different sellers
[797.12 → 802.34] um they were all emailed they got an email from um Amazon saying that this was the case and the only
[802.34 → 808.38] the only recourse they have is that well you can apply to apple to become one of their verified resellers
[808.38 → 812.60] like that's going to happen yeah no, no maybe for a very small minority
[812.60 → 818.02] um so the reason that this is weird though is that there's something in the U.S. that's called
[818.02 → 822.92] first sale doctrine so the United States Supreme Court has ruled that people who legally own a product
[822.92 → 829.66] may legally resell it and federal law protects the right that right under something known as a first sale
[829.66 → 835.62] doctrine and in quotes from that doctrine is an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted
[835.62 → 841.44] work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell display or otherwise dispose of that particular
[841.44 → 845.76] individual copy I don't think that has anything to do with this though it does though because listen
[845.76 → 854.20] okay, so apple can't control that you know um they can't just have their normal authorized resellers
[854.20 → 858.58] they can't control the secondary market because once you own the thing yourself you can sell it as you want
[858.58 → 866.00] but if one of the biggest reseller markets in the world is amazon.com and if apple enters an agreement
[866.00 → 871.36] with Amazon whereby all the apple products sold on Amazon have to adhere to the deal that
[871.36 → 877.82] they strike thereby they can circumvent absolutely this technically I believe that's legal what would
[877.82 → 882.36] have to happen here as far as I know is it would have to be shown that Amazon is effectively a monopoly
[882.36 → 888.74] of online sales for them to uh for the law to be able to cover that because right now it's an
[888.74 → 893.58] individual company being like we don't want to use those people that's completely fine you can decide
[893.58 → 897.36] that people aren't allowed to sell through your platform that's their allowed to do that
[897.36 → 902.76] now okay I'm not saying I necessarily agree with any of this stuff or disagree with it, I'm just
[902.76 → 907.82] saying right now that law won't really affect us because an individual is still completely allowed
[907.82 → 912.80] to sell that thing just they just won't be able to do that on Amazon yeah and Amazon does what's the
[912.80 → 917.88] percentage of online sales that's Amazon probably like 70 or something in the for the U.S. yeah it's like
[917.88 → 924.42] over 10 percent of retail in general I think at this point wow, but it's its huge um this does apply
[924.42 → 933.10] though to their global um all the global reach of Amazon so that's France Germany UK U.S. Italy Spain
[933.10 → 941.48] Japan and India and I don't see Canada on that list interestingly um the other thing that's weird
[941.48 → 947.02] is or I guess expected is that home pod is not going to be sold on Amazon because there's a competitor
[947.02 → 952.60] yeah because they don't because they have the Amazon Echo they also don't sell the Google uh google home
[952.60 → 959.44] yeah um, and so I guess there was another spat that I didn't know about um between apple and Amazon
[959.44 → 969.22] where TV yeah so until last year um you couldn't get Apple TV on Amazon and so because apple wanted
[969.22 → 977.22] Amazon to sell the TV but in turn Amazon wanted the app for Amazon Prime video to appear on the Apple TV
[977.22 → 983.50] and then apple didn't want that so they so the Apple TV was for sale on Amazon, but then it got pulled
[983.50 → 990.36] um because Bezos said that his reasoning was like if you're buying an Apple TV on Amazon
[990.36 → 996.14] the customer it's reasonable for a customer to expect that Amazon's properties Amazon's video is
[996.14 → 1000.12] going to be included on this product that you bought from Amazon and when that's not happening
[1000.12 → 1004.88] the user could be disappointed I'm not sure if I totally buy that argument, but it's reasonable
[1004.88 → 1012.58] that was the rationale there um they got past that though so then today you can buy apple TVs on Amazon
[1012.58 → 1019.14] and Amazon Prime video is on them similar to the spat that they had between um having YouTube on Amazon
[1019.14 → 1025.20] was on echoes on the echo show having YouTube on the echo show that was the thing between Amazon and
[1025.20 → 1033.02] google someone in chat is saying that rule 12 whatever that means uh of U.S. trade law so I guess
[1033.02 → 1037.74] that's what that means also prevents contracts from limiting third party sale as well that sounds
[1037.74 → 1042.18] extremely vague and not all-inclusive and I'm sure there's more to that law and I'm sure there's other
[1042.18 → 1048.80] laws that deal with that law we don't know all of American law no we don't, but presumably this deal was
[1048.80 → 1053.52] made by lawyers yeah on both sides of it probably know what's going on they probably know what that chat
[1053.52 → 1060.02] guy knows yeah, and it appears to be going through yeah I wonder with your point about them being a
[1060.02 → 1065.60] monopoly I wonder if it's relative to online like they're a monopoly online or is it just broadly
[1065.60 → 1073.62] in general uh monopoly law has not been used as much as it used to be used uh it used to be a lot
[1073.62 → 1080.80] more active in terms of crushing monopolies and stopping monopolies from happening but um for quite a few
[1080.80 → 1086.50] years now they've been pretty passive about that stuff so not only am I not sure but I don't
[1086.50 → 1092.38] necessarily know that they would step in anyway and then there's another layer of uh analysis or
[1092.38 → 1098.10] whatever where it's like are they a monopoly of specifically selling apple products well I guess
[1098.10 → 1102.54] that's not even a consideration because apple has a monopoly on selling apple products is every
[1102.54 → 1109.00] individual business, so this actually increases the competition there I wonder also if they're getting a
[1109.00 → 1116.52] bigger if apple pays less to Amazon for each sale than other products they're like look
[1116.52 → 1120.74] because normally they're getting it directly right they don't have to pay out any middleman at all
[1121.42 → 1128.56] interesting I don't know I'm sure there's special deals going on I just don't I've I can't imagine
[1128.56 → 1135.20] what they necessarily are whether it's like you're you're saving on logistics or like maybe all the
[1135.20 → 1141.78] shipping and handling is going to be handled by apple instead of Amazon I would imagine that they're
[1141.78 → 1148.66] going to have uh fulfillment advantages when it launches you being able to get it in one day
[1148.66 → 1154.10] rather than you know I pre-ordered it I'm getting mine first but I have to wait until they all reach me
[1154.10 → 1158.88] Amazon's perfect at getting things too fast, so there'll be some synergies for sure
[1158.88 → 1166.78] yeah uh people are bringing up law stuff we are not claiming to know law stuff um someone's
[1166.78 → 1172.32] saying they're not a monopoly because they're in the international market yeah I have no idea um
[1172.32 → 1177.66] sounds good though I guess this will be something that we watch unfold over the next little while
[1177.66 → 1186.00] uh we'll see what happens when I guess on January 4th it'll be interesting yeah that's when the
[1186.00 → 1192.26] other ones get pulled for sure another interesting thing rumour time valve working on half-life 2
[1192.26 → 1199.08] prequel for VR half-life VR yeah uh it's been VR has been interesting for a little while now because
[1199.08 → 1204.48] um I used to I used to make videos every once in a while I think I made two in total talking about how
[1204.48 → 1212.24] VR is like kind of dying a little bit at least in terms of its current hype not in terms of uh VR is
[1212.24 → 1216.24] like dying with a killing blow I mean they're dying in terms of they're going down it's like
[1216.24 → 1221.76] cryptocurrency hated me for that it's like it's the future but just stop talking about because it's
[1221.76 → 1227.90] like it's the future you're right now yeah you're in 1992 yeah yeah yeah uh so and people hated me for
[1227.90 → 1233.98] that pretty hardcore both times um and I was like guys I'm right, and it's still yeah, but you have
[1233.98 → 1238.82] influence so you're like it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy it was bad it was I was a bad person for
[1238.82 → 1246.18] doing that but um one thing that I held on at that time and I still hold on now is there are
[1246.18 → 1249.98] certain companies in the space that are going to make sure they keep on pushing forward which is
[1249.98 → 1256.58] exactly what we need um Bethesda while they're they're not always in everyone's good graces uh
[1256.58 → 1262.46] seem to be holding up that trumpet for VR and just keep pushing keep announcing more games in VR
[1262.46 → 1267.44] valve keeps on pushing uh it's good this kind of stuff is really awesome to hear I don't necessarily
[1267.44 → 1272.58] think this is going to like to be the winning ticket that's going to make everyone buy a VR headset
[1272.58 → 1278.50] um and like continue to consume VR content because that seems to be actually the biggest problem
[1278.50 → 1285.14] is people buy headsets and then lose interest pretty quick um not everyone calm down I know you like
[1285.14 → 1291.08] your headset I'm just saying a lot of people um well hold your horses because this could come out
[1291.08 → 1296.82] in a decade that we have no idea very when this will come out so it could be the case that when
[1296.82 → 1304.20] it comes out um it's right on some epic wave and the momentum just goes and goes valve time is
[1304.20 → 1309.34] very real yes um, so this could be this could be forever away uh but yeah they're reportedly working
[1309.34 → 1316.68] on their own virtual why yeah hooray uh they're reportedly working on their own virtual reality titles to
[1316.68 → 1321.72] fully take advantage of upcoming hardware like the knuckles controllers which are cool uh including
[1321.72 → 1330.86] a new half-life game but not three uh according to valve news network valve's own VR headset is deep
[1330.86 → 1336.48] in development and when it eventually launches it will be bundled with a game probably this one
[1336.48 → 1342.42] that game is rumoured to be half-life VR story, and it's said to be a prequel to the events of half-life 2
[1342.42 → 1351.14] now a prequel to half-life 2 is not half-life 1 I guess it's half-life 1.5 so I guess like
[1351.14 → 1358.36] uh the gateway to the other dimensions open, but the combine hasn't fully taken over earth yet which
[1358.36 → 1363.64] they did in like seven hours so somewhere in their yeah maybe the whole game takes place over that seven
[1363.64 → 1371.58] hours maybe I don't know, but it's going to be apparently a first, or maybe it's an okay yeah so how do you walk
[1371.58 → 1376.08] around oh there are multiple different ways you could do that how do you think they'll do it um
[1376.08 → 1382.86] most I wouldn't be surprised if it was teleportation personally I actually prefer teleportation over
[1382.86 → 1388.48] like shortwave teleportation have you played doom VR doom no so basically you get your controller and
[1388.48 → 1392.90] you have like an arc that you can shoot out, and it'll put a spot on the ground yeah I've teleported
[1392.90 → 1397.54] like that in different VR things yeah I personally prefer that over joystick movement
[1397.54 → 1403.44] starts to like to mess it's too much yeah I would prefer to teleport and then be able to physically
[1403.44 → 1410.06] move within whatever my bounds are within my newly teleported space is that how doom does it yeah
[1410.06 → 1416.34] um we'll have to see though movement in VR is going to be a problem for a while I have no clue how
[1416.34 → 1422.04] they'll solve it someone will solve it, and then it will be glorious movement and uh full body immersion
[1422.04 → 1427.74] it just seems that even if and when they solve that stuff it's going to be such a high barrier to
[1427.74 → 1433.12] entry it's going to oh yeah like I'm not even buying the DDR mat or like the Wii fit it's like
[1433.12 → 1438.22] oh that's a whole other couple hundred dollar thing yeah well not, not even that not even very likely
[1438.22 → 1441.76] upgrading your computer I know not necessarily for a lot of people in this audience but for most people
[1441.76 → 1447.20] upgrading or getting a computer in the first place then having the space for it then the headset
[1447.20 → 1452.04] itself is really expensive really, really expensive and even if it wasn't there's actually a really
[1452.04 → 1457.58] interesting blog post by palmer lucky uh recently I know he's fairly controversial in a few different
[1457.58 → 1461.96] ways but if you ignore all of that and just read the blog post it's very interesting I would highly
[1461.96 → 1469.06] recommend it um where he talks about even if VR headsets were zero dollars it wasn't that title
[1469.06 → 1474.80] called like free is not cheap enough yeah right, and it's its i very much stand behind a lot of the
[1474.80 → 1480.74] points that he brings up uh it's its right now VR is super cool there's a lot of perfect
[1480.74 → 1486.90] experiences you can have in VR uh what is the oh jeez I always forget the name of games uh
[1486.90 → 1493.66] beat safer oh beat safer is super fun really, really cool idea what do you do um you have lightsabres
[1493.66 → 1498.54] essentially, and you have to hit these blocks, but you have to hit them in the right direction okay so it
[1498.54 → 1502.64] brings in a lot of movement you're sort of dancing the music playing it's its a perfect way to get
[1502.64 → 1509.14] you engaged I know Linus plays what I believe is called box VR uh where he's literally just boxing
[1509.14 → 1512.96] and he has a lot of fun with it a lot of people can find something that they really enjoy there's a
[1512.96 → 1520.10] lot of very cool experiences in VR but most of them are really cool for a very confined amount of time
[1520.10 → 1525.66] they don't keep you on the headset and getting the headset on most people don't want to wear this big
[1525.66 → 1530.30] clunky thing on their head the controller's a little wacky there are a lot of problems with VR
[1530.30 → 1535.44] disconnections uh a lot of people feel a little bit sick still that is still a problem I know it's
[1535.44 → 1540.40] massively reduced from the past, but that is still a problem um it's interesting because there's a lot
[1540.40 → 1544.80] of factors here where you're you just hear well we should bring back arcades this is conducive to
[1544.80 → 1550.16] arcades, but then there are other things that aren't like the space and like real estate's really expensive
[1550.16 → 1555.06] if you're going to have a business that is predicated on people coming in and playing VR you're
[1555.06 → 1560.16] going to need a few setups and each setup needs a pretty big space and eye herpes and eye herpes
[1560.16 → 1566.32] nobody wants to wear another mask and sweat on your face like it's its not uh there there 's's a
[1566.32 → 1571.94] lot of problems with VR right now there are a lot of surmountable problems so that's a good spot to be in
[1571.94 → 1578.82] we there's definitely a very strong future for VR very strong future for AR uh and a
[1578.82 → 1586.24] very strong future for eye herpes yeah careful when you're sharing your headsets uh give people
[1586.24 → 1592.72] to clean the lens off that's a thing by the way google at your own and as far as we know no one
[1592.72 → 1599.14] contracted eye herpes at the last Ltd no, no little we had a little wipes on site no reported cases
[1599.14 → 1606.50] yeah is that a super chat or is that just a tag the pink one it's gone in the chat
[1606.50 → 1611.18] that those yeah oh that's just because someone's doing at Linus tech and twitch chat oh it highlights
[1611.18 → 1615.04] it with pink okay makes it easier for broadcasters to see when people are talking directly to them
[1615.04 → 1618.42] instead of people talking amongst themselves that's useful it's a super chats get highlighted in hell
[1618.42 → 1624.98] don't they yes this is also twitched they don't have uh no they don't have that so if we get on it twitch
[1624.98 → 1626.84] to here oh here we go
[1626.84 → 1635.42] don't we I think we read those at the end have you heard of magically yeah yeah I've heard of magically uh
[1635.42 → 1638.42] let's do ad spots really quick let's jump into that
[1638.42 → 1641.10] sponsor moss organizer
[1641.10 → 1646.70] give me one of those I'm going to give you this one I like this one better one thing i really, really like
[1646.70 → 1649.90] about that one that I bring up every single time they sponsor the show and I think it's the same
[1649.90 → 1655.10] with all their bags yes it is really bright orange insides I haven't even read what I'm supposed
[1655.10 → 1661.10] to say yet I just want to bring this up super bright reflective orange insides really cool it looks
[1661.10 → 1666.94] even more high contrast on the black at the bottom see how you can see the bottom you can see all the
[1666.94 → 1673.34] way to the bottom every bag should have that yes yeah it's amazing there's no more like oh I can't find
[1673.34 → 1679.66] this like black pen in the bottom of my bag because my bullet the entire inside my bag is all black
[1679.66 → 1685.18] and I can't see black against black very well um so they even have the black pack but on the inside
[1685.18 → 1689.90] it's bright orange so you can find things really easily I love if it's so wonderful, and it's like
[1689.90 → 1693.58] slightly reflective so it balances light around really nicely so you can eat things see things
[1693.58 → 1699.18] really well anyway here's the and if you put a LDT logo on that it would totally match the colour scheme
[1699.90 → 1706.22] just saying we should get patches that people can sew on stuff, or we should just get a bag the moss
[1707.26 → 1711.02] we should take this offline but I love that idea I'm trying to think of a clever name
[1711.02 → 1722.06] that right that puts it yeah moss tips I don't know whatever uh moss organizer keeps you protected
[1722.06 → 1727.74] and organized by making simple products with really cool features I'm adding that little bit in myself
[1727.74 → 1733.42] the moss backpacks are great for travelling to and from work or internationally while keeping all your
[1733.42 → 1740.54] electronics safe moss pack Grande this is the black pack is this Grande it looks bigger
[1741.02 → 1746.78] does look bigger I'm not sure though but moss pack Grande fits up to 17-inch laptop this looks like
[1746.78 → 1753.26] it would fit a 17-inch laptop but I'm not sure uh the black pack fits laptops up to 15.6 inches
[1753.26 → 1759.98] made of 1680 d ballistic nylon it feels pretty ballistic that's the coolest to be honest
[1761.10 → 1766.14] uh that makes it tear and abrasion resistant yeah it feels like it feels like that Morgan
[1766.14 → 1772.70] Morgan Freeman that sucker will stop a knife um the zippers are good too they feel like it one thing
[1772.70 → 1778.54] that I don't like about a lot of zippers is when they'll get stuck to the side you know what I mean
[1778.54 → 1782.38] and then you have to like mess with it and readjust it so you can get it in line so you can pull it
[1782.38 → 1787.74] properly these don't have that I have that problem on some rain shells yeah or I have to like go like
[1787.74 → 1793.02] this so my zipper is super straight sideways and stuff and I'll be like oh I mean like when you're
[1793.02 → 1797.58] trying to zip it up, and it gets stuck sideways oh yeah, and you have to like rotate it around and
[1797.58 → 1803.66] get it to these don't have that problem at all happen I love if it's great um the built-in rain fly
[1803.66 → 1808.38] on the black pack provides extra padding for your electronics when not in use it comes out of the
[1808.38 → 1814.62] bottom oh so if you like clunk your bag down it's an extra pad your laptop will bounce on that otherwise
[1814.62 → 1821.10] you just put on this so I used to use a cover for my backpack when I was going to school
[1821.10 → 1827.34] because I was a grocery shopping bag yeah I think it was a garbage bag um so it was much less elegant
[1827.98 → 1832.06] um, but these are actually really smart I used to bike to school, so a lot of rain would kick up onto my
[1832.06 → 1837.42] bag and my what I believe was a garbage bag would keep it clean but I'd have to keep swapping it out
[1837.42 → 1842.46] because it was a freaking garbage bag so if you have this it's probably better off uh internal mounting for

[1988.62 → 1993.18] warehouse so it is actually cold to the touch and yeah it's good nice nice nice good that's a good

[2070.06 → 2076.78] autograph cool are we giving this oh no still have the stickers on it doesn't have any details in
[2076.78 → 2082.70] here about us giving it to someone well it's a nice power supply maybe he just wanted to practice that
[2082.70 → 2086.94] looks so professional even in the placement of the signature yeah it looks like it could have been like
[2087.50 → 2092.22] printed on there anyway I don't think it is so special that out if you're interested and if you're
[2092.22 → 2096.70] watching on YouTube later for the God there will be a link in the description for Amazon if not I'm sure you

[2108.06 → 2112.62] get this bag dude the bags are actually really nice because then you throw your spare cables in the bag
[2113.18 → 2118.94] oh no dude then you never get to use the bag you have to what do you what do you use the bag for um
[2120.38 → 2125.98] uh transporting alcohol in public and style oh like whoa is that crown royal no it's
[2126.62 → 2134.14] it's absolute, but it's in this sick bag super nice bag um okay
[2136.70 → 2140.86] well I'm sure they don't um let's go
[2144.54 → 2151.98] new folding phone details folding phone seems the Samsung folding phone the folding screen the galaxy f
[2151.98 → 2156.54] are you interested I'm interested most people think it's not cool I think it's super oh i
[2156.54 → 2162.22] totally want to check that puppy out yeah I remember the last CES we went there was a ZTE
[2162.22 → 2168.54] holding phone and I thought that's probably junk, but we checked it out, and it was way lighter than i
[2168.54 → 2174.46] thought and when I opened it, it was pretty cool that one has a seam it's actually just two screens and
[2174.46 → 2179.98] there's a hinge right it was pretty good, but this will be next level I think this is going to be a real
[2179.98 → 2185.02] trendsetter um I wouldn't be surprised if apple well they don't want to cannibalize their iPads
[2185.90 → 2194.30] but I think this is an amazing product it's got quite a kind of thick boy bezel going on okay so
[2194.30 → 2197.74] and just the general bezel around the screen bezel around we see that again
[2200.86 → 2204.94] really that's a pretty that's like a quarter inch or like a half inch top
[2206.06 → 2210.78] big boy i do know when they were showing this off they like dimmed the lights and as far
[2210.78 → 2215.18] as I know the body that it's in itself is not fine that's right, and you could see the silhouette
[2215.18 → 2219.74] it was like a brick yeah yeah, but people are going to be willing to make trade-offs like that
[2221.02 → 2227.82] yeah it'll, it'll be interesting, and they'll iterate on it like that looks you know it's pretty thick
[2228.46 → 2233.18] like if it's like a full phone of thickness on each side carrying two phones in your pocket all the time
[2233.18 → 2238.46] what if it's like that thick it's pretty thick like that I mean people have done it like we did it
[2239.02 → 2243.66] uh dude I've carried multiple phones all the time or like in high school when you had a flip phone they
[2243.66 → 2249.42] were just different dimensions yeah usually they were really short though the real question is
[2249.42 → 2255.42] there is any use when it's open, and you're actually using that beautiful big screen do you
[2255.42 → 2259.42] care does it offer you any value that looks huge
[2261.98 → 2265.42] that lock up in that person's hand looks huge I know what that looks like that looks like the
[2265.42 → 2273.58] size of my wife's note 8 in a giant wallet case that she has okay yeah, but then that's it
[2273.58 → 2280.06] folded so then it's like a book i I think there's use because personally if I'm
[2281.98 → 2287.98] let's look at the pixel 3 for instance pixel 3 is tiny for me yeah one hand I can type on it
[2287.98 → 2294.62] just fine but I like typing with two hands when I can yeah okay um and I can type with one hand on a
[2294.62 → 2301.26] pixel 3 XL it's a little bit of a stretch but I can do it just fine do it all the time um but if I had
[2301.26 → 2307.90] like a big nice screen and I was two hand typing sure why not I don't know man because do you ever
[2307.90 → 2313.42] turn your try typing on landscape yeah it's going to be like this wide that's not fine for me, it's annoying
[2313.42 → 2317.50] I got it's like you have to you can't just think it's gonna you can't just let your thumbs go you have to
[2317.50 → 2321.18] like tilt your hand to get to the middle yeah I think like
[2321.18 → 2327.02] yeah, but you're a thick boy
[2329.02 → 2332.94] i just if Linus was here he'd have to like to take his hand off to get to them, but that's the thing
[2332.94 → 2337.74] that's where like I think uh some of the smaller phone form factors it's kind of sad that they're
[2337.74 → 2343.74] going away um because sometimes it's nice that like for my daily driver I like bigger phones generally
[2343.74 → 2347.66] but sometimes it's nice to have a little phone yeah like I want the pixel 3 the small one yeah because
[2347.66 → 2352.14] I do a lot of one-handed yeahs and like I don't have one of those things on the back the rings
[2352.70 → 2356.78] that you put your fingers through yeah apparently is a godsend it makes you I don't like that makes
[2356.78 → 2361.42] your big phone unexpandable yeah I've tried them out but I've never had one myself apparently I love
[2361.42 → 2369.42] it if I get it I don't have the girlfriend runs one of those she loves it but i just yeah I don't know i I think
[2369.42 → 2377.42] I think okay but in this situation yeah see it's weird because like that's it he's doing
[2377.42 → 2381.82] like this like that actually looks pretty small it does not look the same in this photo where
[2381.82 → 2386.54] he's actually holding it that's that's close so that's a back that's that's a display yeah but uh
[2387.26 → 2392.30] this one it's closed too and in this one it looks like it's huge but then when he's actually
[2392.30 → 2399.50] holding that's a rendering though that's true and this is the and that chassis is like not the chassis
[2399.50 → 2403.18] so it'll probably even be smaller than that I would think so and probably has different uh
[2403.18 → 2408.62] bevels and chambers and stuff so what do you think about using Matt generally and then opening it up
[2408.62 → 2413.26] um would you even want to because if you open up you can't like message basically everything I do on
[2413.26 → 2420.14] my freaking phone is messaging of some sorts okay now so this is a second screen right when it's when
[2420.14 → 2425.34] it's closed there's a secondary screen that you can use, and that screen alone is I think like 4.7
[2425.34 → 2430.94] inches or something like that which is like pretty big yeah um that's I don't even know why they really
[2430.94 → 2435.66] have that I mean because there are some phone cases for regular phones that when you close
[2435.66 → 2440.38] them there's a little window yeah, and they work with the phone software to have like notifications
[2440.38 → 2444.94] and a clock in that little window and I think that would be sufficient this is just like so much more
[2444.94 → 2450.78] that like at some point why even open it, and it's just going to drain your battery and everything I think
[2452.06 → 2458.54] I think that's the idea because with this screen yeah that's a lot of screen isn't it Geez um with
[2458.54 → 2463.26] in terms of the battery drain idea I mean its oh it's OLED so it'll turn off it can be completely
[2463.26 → 2471.02] off yeah I'd be scared about breaking it more than the battery but um with this screen if you need to
[2471.02 → 2477.50] one hand you can really easily you don't lose that functionality I don't know i I really don't know if
[2477.50 → 2481.34] I would buy it who do you think it's very interesting you think it's like kind of like the blackberry market
[2481.34 → 2487.26] those people who actually want to run a spreadsheet dude I think it's going to be massive in korea has
[2487.26 → 2492.06] Korea and like I'm not surprised Samsung's making it Korea has always loved gigantic phones
[2492.78 → 2498.54] absolutely monstrous sized phones and like it was really the first time I was in Korea you see people
[2498.54 → 2502.86] with like TV antennas off their phones yeah yeah they had a whole different broadcasting yeah yeah
[2503.66 → 2508.54] but like huge format phones were massive there can we go back to because what about um
[2509.42 → 2514.86] you know people are streaming more and more of their devices what about content consumption if you turn
[2514.86 → 2520.14] that puppy sideways what aspect ratio is that like four by three or something oh boy I don't know
[2521.18 → 2526.54] like you're going to get some you're going to get some black bars one thing I really like about this
[2526.54 → 2532.38] open format though is split screen stuff yeah which was really cool in the ZTE one that we tried yeah
[2533.02 → 2536.78] it's there are a lot of cases that it's useful to have liked your calendar open and your email or
[2536.78 → 2541.10] something like that if I can be messaging and like almost let's say almost
[2541.10 → 2547.42] like separate desktop style split screen a little bit more aggressive than they currently have because
[2547.42 → 2551.82] if you know like the floating do you have Facebook Messenger on your phone have you had a chat heads
[2551.82 → 2556.38] yeah I hate those if you have chat heads open I understand that you hate them but if you have them
[2556.38 → 2561.02] open and when you expand it, it doesn't fill your whole screen it just fills up like the messaging
[2561.02 → 2565.66] portion of your screen yeah you can be watching a video and be doing email and have the chat head
[2565.66 → 2572.30] annoying you all the time and like it that sounds very cool for productivity be able to watch
[2572.30 → 2579.02] or observe something it kind of screws YouTube uh you need to have the premium YouTube in order to be
[2579.02 → 2584.54] watching a video and minimize the app and do other things on your phone with this you just keep it open
[2585.58 → 2590.62] although the YouTube app doesn't support split screen right so would you have to support split screen
[2591.42 → 2595.10] for you to be able to that's why I said I almost want to be a better version where it's like multi desktop
[2595.66 → 2603.66] uh like separated I think that's how yeah I don't think it's the same as actual android split
[2603.66 → 2609.42] screen if I remember the ZTE one they had uh buttons along the bottom to choose what you wanted
[2609.42 → 2616.78] so one button was like put my whole thing as one screen one button was make it a and b yeah because
[2616.78 → 2622.46] with like an a and b setup YouTube might not be able to say no yeah because I don't think it's
[2622.46 → 2626.06] actually the same as android split screen, and then they had a third button that was a and a
[2626.06 → 2631.26] and because with that phone you could put it in like tent mode so I could put it here and you
[2631.26 → 2635.98] could watch it and I could watch it kind of edge case pretty weird let's have our let's watch this
[2635.98 → 2640.14] together but from really far away it's just like you don't have to go like this to watch a video we
[2640.14 → 2643.18] can just like hey check out this video and I can hold my phone like that, and we're both watching it
[2643.18 → 2649.98] sure okay I can look in your eyes his eyes are smiling he likes this part does he like this music
[2649.98 → 2657.34] video I can feel his breath getting heavier oh my god um I mean that's useful like on a train or
[2657.34 → 2665.34] something right sure yeah I could see people doing if it's just not 100 my thing um anyway okay no but
[2665.34 → 2673.02] the new things were that it's called f which is not that sexy no to is that the f you're an f bro
[2673.02 → 2678.54] sounds kind of like s, but it's less cool f bomb yeah and uh the other new thing is the price
[2680.62 → 2688.86] whoa I had not looked at that yet oh I'm not buying this phone one thousand seven hundred seventy
[2688.86 → 2695.82] dollar I get it I'm not going to buy it I understand the price I understand why it has to be that
[2695.82 → 2702.38] expensive you got so many screens that thing's huge you're probably going to need the r and the r d like
[2702.38 → 2705.90] they've been working on this for years they're not going to sell that many of them it's such a premium
[2705.90 → 2713.10] device yes it's I get it but holy crap it's amazing that they're like beating apple in their own game
[2713.10 → 2720.22] in a way I love how some people in chat have started saying f for the price so like f to
[2720.22 → 2724.94] pay respects so it's like I have to pay respects for this phone called an f I love that I want to riff
[2724.94 → 2731.98] on this apple angle though um it's interesting because right now you're seeing smartphones flatten
[2731.98 → 2737.58] out it's a mature market yes everyone in the dog is making them yeah um when a new category gets kind
[2737.58 → 2743.34] of forged by the innovator usually having a vertically integrated product gives you an
[2743.34 → 2747.66] advantage because when your company is handling all the different parts of it then you get this kind
[2747.66 → 2752.30] of performance delta that you benefit from and that's what iPhones benefited from for years, and they're
[2752.30 → 2760.06] losing that performance delta now as the product gets commoditized and yet now you're seeing Samsung
[2760.06 → 2766.70] which actually is also a vertically integrated phone company in ways different to apple has the
[2766.70 → 2772.94] hardware and software integration Samsung has a hardware integration across the stack like they
[2772.94 → 2776.38] make the screens they make all these other components they make more of their phone's
[2776.38 → 2781.42] components than any other cell phone maker out there as far as I know and so it's a different type of
[2781.42 → 2786.78] vertical integration and in this case it's still in 2018 giving them a performance delta where they're
[2786.78 → 2792.86] the ones who get to actually innovate um not by just like removing headphone jacks and actually put
[2792.86 → 2798.22] out this crazy uh perhaps revolutionary or at least evolutionary product which is pretty cool
[2798.22 → 2804.94] and they're also beating apple in their own game insofar as finding a way to charge a butt ton of money
[2804.94 → 2810.94] for a phone yeah whereas like with apple they've kind of got all the apple customers in the world that
[2810.94 → 2816.30] exist, and now they're just trying to squeeze more money per customer and by pushing the price up to
[2816.30 → 2824.30] 1500 for the new 10s at almost two grand that's that's going to be more than like a not a
[2824.30 → 2829.98] majority at all but a significant notable percentage of the amount of people watching this show it'll be
[2829.98 → 2839.34] more than their first car definitely more than the desktop 1770 us dollars yeah like I think that's about
[2839.34 → 2849.18] that's about the um global monthly income the global average monthly income yeah so that's crazy uh okay
[2849.18 → 2855.66] put it this way though if you're going to get the most expensive iPhone 10s max it's more than 256 gigabyte
[2855.66 → 2864.06] version it's like 1550 would you spend an extra 100 or 200 to get this well I wouldn't get a max
[2865.26 → 2868.54] so it's like a bit of a difficult question but I understand where you're coming from
[2868.54 → 2873.82] and maybe I also think it might have a perfect space not that the space isn't even going to
[2873.82 → 2881.98] necessarily be around for all that long um but if you gave this phone to someone who had like who was
[2881.98 → 2888.78] who did not grow up with phones and was somewhat vision impaired by a little bit the like expanded
[2888.78 → 2893.34] icon version on this phone is going to be awesome okay you take this thing out of your pocket you unfold it
[2893.34 → 2898.30] and you just have this huge screen if you need to peck type it's going to be easy I think
[2898.30 → 2901.50] there's going to be certain demographics I love this phone I think uh there's a lot of people in the
[2901.50 → 2906.78] world where their phone is their computer yeah I think there's business people like they're gonna
[2906.78 → 2911.26] have like the blackberry market like every real estate agent is going to have this phone because they
[2911.26 → 2915.18] like to flex and because you know they got to open up their day planner, and it'd be awesome to have
[2915.18 → 2921.90] your calendar open that big uh yeah brew I can't read the rest of your name because it blends in with the
[2921.90 → 2928.70] pinkish hue of that message really aggressively uh yeah I'm not I wouldn't get a max largely because
[2928.70 → 2935.90] I don't like uh Samsung software he was like would get a max but wouldn't buy or is interested
[2935.90 → 2941.58] in a pixel 3xl first not really pixel 3xls are kind of a disaster I think all phones right now
[2941.58 → 2950.70] are a little deep but yeah whatever uh I'm sitting on an original pixel XL wow with like a cracked screen
[2951.26 → 2955.82] and a basically fried out battery and I just don't really want to do you think this thing's
[2955.82 → 2961.58] going to have junk battery life on the one hand it's pretty big maybe it has two batteries
[2962.14 → 2965.82] on the other hand it has three big screens, but they're olds they can turn off
[2966.70 → 2972.78] yeah if you have two batteries, and you usually just use the one screen
[2972.78 → 2979.74] like you could drag that battery out for a long time a bit cool although I think you'll notice
[2979.74 → 2985.02] like significant decrease in battery oh yeah start unfolding it very often yeah yeah that's going to be
[2985.02 → 2992.86] pretty oof I hope it has a satisfying click when you open it bam yeah yeah yeah that's what it's all
[2992.86 → 2997.90] about or what if you put a ring on the back of it, and you can just take it out of your pocket with one
[2997.90 → 3003.42] hand and go that would hell yeah honestly that would possibly sell it if you're watching if
[3003.42 → 3007.66] Samsung's watching is that good that's your ad right there that's your commercial
[3007.66 → 3014.62] I could be like zero that's your that's your unlock
[3017.18 → 3024.62] that's so sweet uh talking about so sweet RTX in battlefield 5 finally you'll be able to use your
[3024.62 → 3031.10] thingamajig the first unless your graphics card lit on fire if it's not ashes you can finally play a
[3031.10 → 3040.54] a publicly available official title with RTX on ha paired with GeForce uh 4 16.94 sickle drivers uh
[3040.54 → 3048.86] Windows 10 1809 and patch battlefield 5 you haven't heard that no I've never heard that yeah um
[3048.86 → 3052.14] you'll be in for a surprise the performance drops roughly 50 percent
[3052.14 → 3060.46] hey man whatever man
[3064.70 → 3070.54] it costs a lot to look this good we got some actual frame rate numbers here oh my god
[3071.66 → 3076.30] so there's a link if you click through to the second source you can actually see some screens
[3076.30 → 3084.38] of there was a bug that prevented them from testing a medium sure yeah okay uh yeah apparently what
[3084.38 → 3089.02] happened was what they um when they tried to set it to medium it would actually just keep the settings
[3089.02 → 3093.02] from the last one they were on so if they went from low to medium it would show it would just run it
[3093.02 → 3099.66] low and if they went from high to medium it would run it high oh okay so if they were running with the
[3099.66 → 3106.22] ray tracing off with their at 1080p with their 2080 ti which I can tell you I've played a bit about
[3106.22 → 3115.10] battlefield 5 looks beautiful well it can look more beautiful if you don't want 158.8 frames per
[3115.10 → 3125.34] second, and you're like hey I'll take 65 who has a 2080 ti and a 1080p screen unless you're going for
[3125.34 → 3131.82] a crazy high refresh rate at which point in time you're not turning on RTX, or you're not turning on
[3131.82 → 3139.74] ray tracing I should say more specifically yeah well you can run in 4k at 30 fps hey man that
[3139.74 → 3146.70] used to be enough not really actually if you go really far back in gaming like original I think
[3146.70 → 3156.70] it was Mario Kart and stuff was still 60, but you could do 4k with um RTX on low or del Dr on low or medium
[3156.70 → 3163.58] it provided medium works because they have given us levels that you can do off low medium high and ultra
[3164.22 → 3173.26] and um so 4k ultra is 30 fps is that right that's right so turning on ray tracing at all you get a no
[3173.26 → 3176.78] matter what level you get a huge reduction they should have shown us
[3176.78 → 3185.02] yeah I want more stuff than this go to here there are tons of stuff is there more yeah they did
[3185.02 → 3193.82] if there's a full yeah just i got I'm right there yeah just touch it you got the touch screen
[3193.82 → 3197.90] hold on um, so this is the visuals if you go to the bottom okay hold on hold on
[3197.90 → 3205.98] expand some of those it looks cool click they're not the same screenshots no this is all this
[3205.98 → 3210.86] isn't a side-by-side comparison this is just all on oh okay, okay but if you go to the bottom there's
[3210.86 → 3213.98] a table of contents thing, and you can go to performance and see all this side by side
[3215.10 → 3221.42] maybe of what though I think it's ultra and low yeah versus ultra this is not that much of a difference
[3221.42 → 3230.14] between low and ultra so if you're going to throw that's ultra so if you're looking at the reflection
[3230.14 → 3233.10] in the if you look at the reflection in the window that reflection is all still there
[3234.94 → 3240.94] that's so cool though with RTX hey you can't that's seen unrelated things oh no, no that's not true i just
[3240.94 → 3246.86] didn't see them the first time, so the light on these like little metal bars show up a lot more
[3247.82 → 3252.70] it's so cool that it doesn't look better you can look through a window that's transparent and
[3252.70 → 3256.62] even though you're looking through and seeing the environment through the window you're still you're
[3256.62 → 3260.38] also seeing the reflection of the stuff behind you that wasn't possible before and that's so
[3260.38 → 3265.26] realistic it's super cool, and you get that regardless of its lower ultra so I think a lot of
[3265.26 → 3271.42] people are end up turning it on and running it out low it's pretty awesome how uh it makes it worse
[3271.42 → 3276.70] competitively that's pretty cool I hope a lot of you guys turn that on so I can kill you
[3276.70 → 3281.34] more easily in the game um memory usage
[3284.22 → 3285.18] performance
[3289.50 → 3295.34] ultra ultra ultra where's like uh scroll more, or you're at the bottom already that's it
[3296.54 → 3301.58] we look so if it says ultra up here is that assuming Dr is on ultra no, no no, no here it is
[3301.58 → 3307.18] that means the game's running at ultra 20 70, but then it stops detail right that's because this
[3307.18 → 3312.94] is off, and then it's getting higher details so where's 20 this is a little messy guys well it's
[3312.94 → 3318.46] all the different cards right 28 Dr this is what are you looking for ultra it's like up here
[3318.46 → 3325.18] I don't see any more 20 ti ultra-right there medium
[3328.06 → 3334.46] huh oh right because the medium was glitched or whatever right yeah so Dr low
[3337.18 → 3341.90] what oh that's 2070 they don't have 2080 ti with Dr low
[3341.90 → 3347.42] yeah they do it's uh it's uh farther down this way oh deep I'm still reading this backwards
[3349.02 → 3358.62] ultra-high, so there's 0.5 fps difference between ultra and high for Dr at 4k this is 1440 yeah
[3360.06 → 3365.42] 20 ti Dr high 52.6 fps
[3365.42 → 3374.14] so you'll have to and then medium still bugs damn it so it's the sweet spot above the sweet
[3374.14 → 3382.62] spots probably luckily with my monitor haha 1440p uh 20 ti Dr on medium once it actually works you'll
[3382.62 → 3390.46] be above 60 fps, and you'll still have Dr on and I guess low is still pretty nice I will note that there
[3390.46 → 3394.30] is actually a pretty major difference I agree with you if you want those reflections and stuff just having
[3394.30 → 3402.70] it on a minimum is pretty cool but in those side by sides especially the bars in the window
[3402.70 → 3410.70] that actually stood out to me a lot yeah like if you're just going for realism that looks
[3410.70 → 3415.18] nice you can barely see the bars on the window on the first one, and they really stand on the second
[3415.18 → 3418.94] one whether okay to be completely honest whether that's a good thing whether
[3418.94 → 3423.66] that's actually realistic I don't know because if they're black bars that's how they would look
[3424.30 → 3428.38] right well yeah who knows I don't know what materials with bars are supposed to be and i
[3428.38 → 3432.38] don't know if there's a light directly shining on the yeah I don't know either so we can't, I can't
[3432.38 → 3438.78] really tell I don't know turn it on during the campaign yeah that sucker on low online yeah and let
[3438.78 → 3444.94] the frames rip and like in this situation the gun it looks different uh is it supposed to be that
[3444.94 → 3449.58] dirty or is it supposed to be shiny like this I don't know they can both be fairly realistic
[3449.58 → 3457.10] I'm not sure but I would play around with it in single player you will be literally better off
[3457.10 → 3463.66] turning it off in multiplayer we've talked about that in the past and one final thing to wrap up um
[3464.30 → 3473.66] Stan Lee died this week guys he was 95 yeah he died on Monday luckily I will say like obviously it's sad
[3473.66 → 3481.42] um, but we have to look back on the positive stuff he lived a long and very fulfilling life I think
[3482.30 → 3487.58] and I think what a legend yeah exactly rest in power Stanley exactly what a legend like it's so
[3487.58 → 3493.26] crazy when you're a kid, and you're watching uh let's say you're watching like a spider-man 90s
[3493.98 → 3500.94] cartoon yeah and any of these heroes is presented with a dilemma there's a right thing to do and the
[3500.94 → 3509.42] wrong thing to do and not only these shows kind of teach kids the idea of what the right
[3509.42 → 3515.26] thing to do is but that you watch enough of these that you're sitting there as a child, and you know
[3515.26 → 3520.22] what the right thing to do is, and you know the hero is going to do that thing it's just so crazy that um
[3521.18 → 3529.42] a person can take part in creating the mythology of our entire society it's nuts that's crazy he did a lot
[3529.42 → 3534.86] he did that uh people like him do that I guess Disney that kind of stuff does that but um
[3535.98 → 3541.90] that's just like the entire imagination of the culture he lived a long life he impacted more lives
[3541.90 → 3547.74] than the vast majority of people ever like a vast majority of people ever positively
[3548.30 → 3553.98] and uh I think he made a lot of uh really really really cool things that will live on for a very long
[3553.98 → 3558.38] time speaking of cool things uh Netflix added a feature where if you're in your search bar you type
[3558.38 → 3564.62] in excelsior with an exclamation point um which is Stanley's catchphrase he used to sign off um his
[3564.62 → 3570.94] articles with that yeah it will just bring up all the marvel uh oh that's cool search results there
[3570.94 → 3574.38] your results are going to vary depending on the region you're in but just a little Easter egg which
[3574.38 → 3582.14] is pretty cool and I got some little Stanley facts here okay go okay uh did you know that he's been in 16
[3582.14 → 3588.94] marvel films since the first uh 2000s x-men uh and because he does those cameos right yeah they're
[3588.94 → 3594.78] actually in the contract really there's a contract that stipulates he has to appear in every film
[3594.78 → 3600.38] that's uh based on the character he created isn't that awesome that's cool that's probably my favourite
[3600.38 → 3606.06] one there are a couple other facts and you guys can check out um oh yeah there's actually three cameos
[3606.06 → 3612.54] still to come and I was also gonna actually ask this question you know how Star Wars did like CGI
[3613.18 → 3618.54] oh yeah people passed away what would you think if they just kept cameoing Stanley
[3620.06 → 3625.74] honestly kind of cool that would be kind of cool I think it makes sense personally there's and there's
[3625.74 → 3633.58] an interview with um who is it the person who took over like the current CEO of marvel, and he's he's he
[3633.58 → 3639.66] apparently visited Stanley before like two days before he passed away, and he said that he was he
[3639.66 → 3645.34] was still talking about even though he had like accepted uh allegedly accepted his fate he was still
[3645.34 → 3650.06] talking about doing future cameos because he just it was like he loved doing the cameos as long as he
[3650.06 → 3653.90] didn't have to travel it was like his like favourite thing to do so I think it would be kind of cool
[3653.90 → 3659.74] I think it makes sense I feel like it's something he would want to do I feel like even though he is body
[3659.74 → 3665.98] is now gone the things he created still live on and I think he would want to be a part of it
[3665.98 → 3670.14] personally, and he is going to appear in Ralph breaks the internet the sequel to wreck it Ralph
[3670.14 → 3675.02] he's going to be in spider-man into the spot or yeah into the spider-verse is the next spider-man
[3675.02 → 3678.70] movie I guess, and he might end up being in avengers 4 which is coming out in May
[3679.66 → 3683.82] and going with what you're talking about he actually is immortalized in the amazing spider-man game
[3684.38 → 3687.74] from I believe 2017 because there's like some DLC where you can play as
[3687.74 → 3693.10] Stan Lee, and you can like web sling around we have that link you can check it on YouTube
[3693.10 → 3696.62] i I don't know we don't have it linked well you can google it that's awesome no we do have a link
[3696.62 → 3702.62] there it is there's a YouTube clip speaking of crazy stuff detective Pikachu do we want to
[3703.58 → 3709.50] I don't know there's a kind of uncanny valley thing going on with those Pokémon it's weird it's weird
[3709.50 → 3715.02] I don't know if there is a good way to do this I'm not going to see this movie guys you're not going to
[3715.02 → 3720.46] see it I'll see it if the reviews are off the chain, but they're not it's going to be junk
[3722.94 → 3723.50] it's going to be
[3726.46 → 3732.14] okay from the director some of the okay some of some of the Pokémon are weird that's I think my
[3732.14 → 3738.14] the biggest problem with it like what is it Mr mine an Evie the Mr mine's hands that's that's what
[3738.14 → 3744.38] I'm saying with uncanny valley they have like this realistic skin it's kind of creepy even Pikachu's
[3744.38 → 3753.10] like dude like too high-res my man but what did you want i I don't think there's a Charmander is
[3753.10 → 3760.22] like oh they look weird or not the Charmander the uh Charizard the bolster's like what that thing's
[3760.22 → 3764.22] really weird I think it's an Evie I'm not even sure Greninja looks fine to be completely honest
[3764.22 → 3772.38] I don't know they should have gotten a side duck oh yeah it's weird so weird Charizard looks good
[3773.58 → 3780.86] he's at the end yeah Mr Mr Mr mine's hands the rest of it I don't actually bother see all the like
[3780.86 → 3785.98] weird like this is definitely a glove wrinkles oh yeah it's weird
[3785.98 → 3793.98] weird I don't know man from the director who brought you such classics as shark tales monsters
[3793.98 → 3797.74] versus aliens Gulliver's travels and goosebumps
[3801.50 → 3804.46] I mean he looks so weird
[3804.46 → 3813.18] you look so weird do you think that they're consistent at least like what the heck
[3816.14 → 3821.58] that looks like that painting the scream yeah yeah yeah do you think that there's consistency
[3821.58 → 3826.86] across the different Pokémon do you know they have artistic uh harmony no you think they all look
[3826.86 → 3833.90] like one-offs kind of yeah yeah I don't know I'm not that into it, I don't know what chat necessarily
[3833.90 → 3842.22] thinks if this gets a rotten tomato of plus 75 and an IMDB of over seven I'll go so you're not going
[3844.22 → 3849.34] it's going to be junk a lot of people are pissed that it's ryan Reynolds they don't think I don't
[3849.34 → 3856.38] know they don't think he fits I think it's okay I don't care him being Pikachu yeah I think that's
[3856.38 → 3861.58] maybe a little weird I feel like he'd be better as like growth or something big time
[3861.58 → 3867.10] better as growth yeah, yeah like a more playful kind of character Pikachu was always very I don't know
[3867.10 → 3874.46] he's a little more cutesy yeah like very much so who would do a good Pikachu I have no idea
[3878.78 → 3885.34] Linus someone beloved yeah maybe a higher voice I don't know I feel like a higher voice because Ryan
[3885.34 → 3891.66] Reynolds is just Ryan Reynolds in every movie you know yeah yeah I feel like a higher voice
[3892.14 → 3900.06] um probably someone with a little bit less like yeah the Ryan Reynolds style a little bit I love
[3900.06 → 3905.74] Ryan Reynolds Ryan if you're watching this local boy no hate hell yeah, and you're not just Ryan Reynolds
[3905.74 → 3910.46] I've seen you in Amityville Horror it was perfect you were serious it was good but I don't think
[3910.46 → 3914.94] he's Pikachu I think he could pull off to be honest quite a few different Pokémon very well
[3915.58 → 3921.50] especially the ones that talk like growth yeah um I can't think of who would be a good growth I think
[3921.50 → 3926.14] is like typecast perfectly, but there's I think there are a few others that would play really well
[3926.14 → 3932.62] with Ryan Reynolds style give him a Squirtle even hell yeah let him Squirtle squad leader Ryan Reynolds
[3932.62 → 3937.02] with those sunglasses so don't deal with the sunglasses come on those triangle ones yeah
[3937.58 → 3942.38] he could pull that off so well i just I don't personally think Pikachu was the right decision
[3942.38 → 3947.26] here I think him being in the movie 100 give me a Pokémon movie where Ryan Reynolds is the voice of
[3947.26 → 3952.54] every Pokémon that's it except to be honest that would be funny in its own right I'm like a lot of
[3952.54 → 3958.14] people are saying Danny DeVito oh wow that was that's brutal, but its funny someone dubbed someone
[3958.14 → 3965.34] put some Danny DeVito lyrics with Pikachu, and it's pretty funny yeah that's enough that's it that's
[3965.34 → 3970.78] it for the show I hope you liked it if you did come back next week and then I'm gonna press this button
[3972.06 → 3977.10] what about super chats uh did anyone even super chat us oh yeah
[3979.10 → 3980.14] super chat
[3980.14 → 4000.94] let's okay so let's let's go through some of these personally I think that ray tracing is just a
[4000.94 → 4008.70] distraction to Moore's uh okay we can't really increase performance anymore uh you can, we're doing

[4147.82 → 4152.54] in his when he's old when he's too old for YouTube yeah that'd be interesting
