[0.00 → 1.86] WAN show yet this week.
[2.38 → 2.70] Okay.
[3.64 → 7.38] And also Ry zen 3000, so topics that you care about.
[7.48 → 9.22] We're also going to discuss YouTube Rewind.
[9.40 → 11.38] I only made it about halfway through, so...
[11.38 → 11.60] Really?
[11.74 → 14.06] It might have gotten a lot better towards the end, but...
[14.06 → 14.52] Did you... Okay.
[14.70 → 15.84] I kind of suspect it didn't.
[16.00 → 17.18] I'll wait. We'll get into that later.
[17.26 → 18.06] And finally...
[18.06 → 20.74] CSGO is now free and also gets a Battle Royale mode,
[20.82 → 21.86] because every game needs one.
[21.86 → 23.86] I don't know. I refuse to talk about that.
[26.86 → 28.90] It's just... No.
[30.00 → 31.14] No!
[32.14 → 33.16] Oh my goodness.
[51.86 → 56.86] As a Prime player, you can choose to...
[56.86 → 58.20] No, no. You're baiting me.
[58.20 → 60.32] I said I wasn't going to talk about this.
[60.66 → 61.80] I didn't even...
[61.80 → 62.24] No!
[62.56 → 64.34] You made me ask a question!
[66.92 → 68.38] I've been boondoggled!
[68.58 → 71.34] As a Prime player, you can choose to not get cued
[71.34 → 73.34] against people who are not Prime players.
[73.52 → 75.62] I want to talk about...
[75.62 → 76.52] Oh, okay.
[78.78 → 79.22] Why?
[80.48 → 81.46] Okay. No.
[81.46 → 84.80] I want to start with the really important stuff.
[84.98 → 87.00] So, Luke and I had a meeting today.
[87.24 → 87.72] Oh, boy.
[87.86 → 88.90] We are going to be making...
[88.90 → 89.34] Oh, wow.
[89.48 → 90.84] Today is actually like...
[90.84 → 91.82] Have a talk to the team yet.
[91.82 → 93.00] ...kind of announcement WAN show.
[93.50 → 93.74] Yeah.
[93.88 → 96.02] Oh, I'm so excited for one of them.
[96.04 → 97.22] It's going to be incredible.
[97.76 → 97.92] Okay.
[98.18 → 99.50] So, first...
[99.50 → 100.52] Good shirt choice, by the way.
[100.88 → 101.44] Float plane...
[101.44 → 101.98] Thank you.
[102.64 → 106.28] Float plane has some big milestones coming up.
[106.34 → 106.64] Yeah.
[106.64 → 108.18] Which none of the team knows about.
[108.24 → 109.16] At the end of this year.
[109.46 → 109.68] Yeah.
[109.92 → 113.86] So, it's going to be actually pretty freaking awesome.
[114.20 → 114.38] Yeah.
[114.58 → 117.46] And one of the things that's going to happen before then
[117.46 → 120.38] is live-streaming support with chat
[120.38 → 124.04] and all that cool stuff is dropping very, very soon.
[124.70 → 127.02] So, you can expect, if you're a Float plane member,
[127.26 → 131.50] you are going to be simultaneously multicasting.
[131.76 → 133.74] We are going to be simultaneously multicasting
[133.74 → 135.34] to YouTube, Twitch...
[135.34 → 135.94] You could be, too.
[135.94 → 139.70] And Floatplane.com next Friday.
[139.96 → 140.18] Yeah.
[140.38 → 141.28] So, that's going to happen.
[141.42 → 141.84] Exciting.
[141.96 → 141.98] Fresh.
[141.98 → 145.18] I can't promise special treatment for the Float plane chat.
[152.00 → 152.94] And in other news...
[154.46 → 156.46] YouTube Rewind dropped yesterday.
[156.76 → 157.02] Yeah.
[157.18 → 157.48] Yeah.
[158.74 → 159.30] Okay.
[159.38 → 159.56] Yeah.
[159.56 → 162.94] So, why did you only make it halfway...
[162.94 → 163.64] Okay.
[163.76 → 163.98] Sorry.
[163.98 → 166.52] One of the Float plane guys just said an inside joke
[166.52 → 167.68] and that caught me off guard.
[169.46 → 171.62] Why did you only make it halfway through?
[171.76 → 172.04] Okay.
[172.14 → 172.72] So, here's the thing.
[172.78 → 173.92] I have a confession to make.
[173.98 → 174.74] I've never made it.
[174.98 → 175.84] No, I did.
[176.18 → 179.44] I think the year PewDiePie became number one,
[180.18 → 181.74] I might have made it all the way through
[181.74 → 183.40] because I remember seeing the bit at the end
[183.40 → 185.08] with him walking on the beach or something.
[185.32 → 186.12] Does that ring a bell?
[186.12 → 186.98] I thought it...
[186.98 → 187.86] I don't know if it ends that way
[187.86 → 188.62] or starts with that he, like,
[188.68 → 190.06] picks up the play button on the beach.
[190.12 → 190.50] Oh, crap.
[190.54 → 191.30] Maybe that was the start.
[191.40 → 192.62] Maybe I didn't make it through that one either.
[192.64 → 193.14] Back when Rewind was good
[193.14 → 194.08] and had relevant people.
[194.22 → 194.50] Okay.
[194.50 → 194.54] Okay.
[194.60 → 195.30] So, hold on a second.
[195.50 → 197.94] So, I have to confess that I...
[197.94 → 198.60] Marquez is in it.
[198.62 → 199.18] Marquez is cool.
[199.20 → 201.16] Don't think I have ever made it
[201.16 → 202.40] all the way through a Rewind
[202.40 → 205.02] because I don't really watch YouTube.
[205.72 → 206.60] So, for me,
[206.66 → 208.54] it's kind of like this parade of people
[208.54 → 210.22] that I don't know who the heck they are.
[210.40 → 212.00] Well, I think that's the problem right now.
[212.00 → 213.74] So, that was one key difference this year
[213.74 → 215.62] is I knew who Marquez was.
[215.76 → 215.96] Yeah.
[216.18 → 217.00] I knew who...
[217.64 → 218.58] Because he's amazing.
[219.58 → 220.58] Have you watched his...
[220.58 → 221.24] This is totally off-topic.
[221.36 → 225.20] Have you watched his camera, phone, comparison?
[225.76 → 227.30] Oh, the bracket that he's doing?
[227.48 → 228.78] Well, I don't really watch YouTube,
[228.92 → 230.16] but I'm aware that he's doing it.
[230.36 → 230.82] It's done.
[230.98 → 231.20] It's up.
[231.36 → 231.80] Oh, okay.
[231.90 → 232.08] Yeah.
[232.18 → 233.36] It's actually fascinating.
[233.54 → 234.02] Okay, good.
[234.12 → 234.68] You should watch it.
[234.68 → 234.96] Okay.
[235.08 → 235.34] All right.
[235.36 → 236.68] Or, like, skip to the end bracket.
[236.82 → 237.88] I'll skim through it.
[237.90 → 238.12] Okay.
[238.38 → 238.58] Yeah.
[238.70 → 239.70] That's, like, the most...
[239.70 → 240.46] That's a compliment.
[240.46 → 241.50] Like, it's...
[241.50 → 243.52] He doesn't watch anything.
[244.46 → 246.22] The fact that he's going to skim through it
[246.22 → 247.46] and, like, actually get enough information,
[247.58 → 251.06] like, that's not a side against the video.
[251.18 → 252.16] That's pretty good.
[254.38 → 258.86] Anywho, I recognize Gaurav, Technical Guru.
[259.12 → 259.96] I recognized...
[259.96 → 260.26] He was in it?
[260.62 → 260.98] Yep.
[261.24 → 264.24] Like, I don't know, for, like, three seconds.
[264.30 → 265.28] Yeah, because I didn't see him.
[265.30 → 267.10] He's, like, on the island, and he's like,
[267.10 → 269.04] Oh, I think we should acknowledge people
[269.04 → 271.10] who contributed to charitable.
[271.10 → 272.46] When they're, like, jumping different people.
[272.60 → 272.72] Yeah.
[272.72 → 273.04] Okay.
[273.38 → 273.92] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[274.28 → 276.58] And then I recognized Emma Chamberlain,
[276.98 → 281.14] who I'm only aware of because I was reading an article
[281.14 → 284.44] on something about something,
[284.62 → 287.78] and somehow I ended up looking at the Streams Awards,
[288.06 → 289.70] and she was the breakout creator.
[290.12 → 291.80] And then I spent, actually,
[292.26 → 294.84] probably about an hour and a half on her channel
[294.84 → 295.76] trying to get it.
[295.76 → 300.84] And what I realized is that I still don't really get it,
[301.14 → 304.50] and I'm probably not gonna start watching YouTube
[304.50 → 305.36] anytime soon.
[306.56 → 308.10] Anyway, so other than that,
[308.16 → 310.30] I didn't really know who anybody was.
[310.74 → 312.40] I think, okay, so I think that's a big problem
[312.40 → 313.08] with YouTube Rewind.
[313.18 → 316.86] So back in, like, 2012, 2013,
[317.56 → 318.44] when YouTube Rewind was...
[318.44 → 319.84] Have you been doing it that long?
[319.84 → 320.44] Oh, yeah.
[320.68 → 321.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[322.78 → 324.52] 2012 YouTube Rewind's, like, a thing.
[325.74 → 326.14] Okay.
[327.22 → 327.66] 2011.
[327.66 → 327.94] 2011.
[328.20 → 328.52] They had one.
[328.70 → 329.68] Oh, 2010.
[330.40 → 331.86] They had a 2010 Rewind.
[331.86 → 333.84] I don't know when they actually started it, but...
[335.40 → 336.02] They called it...
[336.02 → 339.86] This was called YouTube Rewind Year in Reviews.
[340.00 → 343.02] So over 250 million views combined.
[343.32 → 346.34] And it's, like, kind of clip show from your TV screen.
[346.54 → 348.34] It has, like, oh, that guy's awesome,
[348.34 → 349.82] the Old Spice commercial guy.
[351.26 → 353.04] Oh, it's got a bunch of Twilight on it.
[353.10 → 354.04] There's a crying child.
[354.16 → 356.10] Yeah, so this is, like, pretty low grade
[356.10 → 357.34] compared to what they...
[357.34 → 358.92] But, like, if you notice...
[358.92 → 360.34] But it goes back that far.
[360.52 → 361.72] You're not screen sharing, by the way,
[361.74 → 362.72] so no one can see this.
[362.72 → 363.16] Oh, I'm sorry.
[363.28 → 363.96] I'm so sorry.
[364.04 → 365.84] One thing you'll notice from this Rewind
[365.84 → 368.50] is it's showing things that happened
[368.50 → 370.28] that mattered that got a lot of views
[370.28 → 370.82] throughout the year.
[371.34 → 373.38] And new Rewinds are just...
[373.38 → 375.20] Powered by YouTube Trends
[375.20 → 377.20] as opposed to powered by YouTube Arbitrary.
[377.52 → 377.84] Yeah.
[377.84 → 380.84] And new Rewinds are
[380.84 → 382.28] here's a bunch of people
[382.28 → 385.04] doing completely intensely unrelated things
[385.04 → 385.82] for the most part
[385.82 → 388.90] or, like, vague Fortnite fork knife references.
[388.90 → 390.60] That was not vague.
[390.62 → 391.90] No, the beginning isn't,
[392.06 → 392.90] but later on.
[393.28 → 394.40] I see, I see, I see.
[395.10 → 397.26] Like, none of it matters.
[397.56 → 398.74] None of it actually represented, like,
[398.80 → 400.06] impactful things throughout the year.
[400.18 → 401.30] There was no T-series.
[401.70 → 403.42] There was no year review.
[403.62 → 404.80] There was none of that kind of stuff.
[404.80 → 406.80] How was T-series not...
[406.80 → 408.60] Even if you don't include PewDiePie
[408.60 → 410.16] because of the stuff that's happened to him
[410.16 → 410.98] and whatever, whatever,
[411.06 → 412.12] that's a totally different conversation.
[412.54 → 413.98] How was T-series not a part of that?
[414.50 → 414.84] Yeah.
[415.20 → 415.62] That...
[415.62 → 416.16] What?
[416.60 → 417.80] Like, my...
[417.80 → 418.80] It's very...
[418.80 → 419.24] It's very...
[419.24 → 420.48] It's very cleaned off.
[420.56 → 422.96] Like, Google is pushing hard into India.
[423.24 → 423.42] Oh, yeah.
[423.42 → 424.76] Don't imagine for a second
[424.76 → 426.50] that any of this T-series
[426.50 → 430.06] and rising in prominence of Indian channels,
[430.14 → 431.14] don't imagine for a second
[431.14 → 432.82] any of this is a random accident.
[433.54 → 436.58] Like, Google is pushing really hard.
[436.96 → 438.08] They're pushing on Chrome.
[438.20 → 439.26] They're pushing on Android.
[439.48 → 440.44] They're pushing on YouTube.
[440.80 → 443.60] They are pushing into India.
[443.94 → 444.88] Okay, so some people are saying
[444.88 → 446.12] the PewDiePie drama is for teenagers.
[446.64 → 448.24] We're saying completely regardless
[448.24 → 449.34] of the PewDiePie versus T-series.
[449.34 → 450.60] That doesn't change the fact that it's happening.
[450.60 → 452.90] T-series is still massive, and they're huge,
[453.12 → 456.32] and the Indian YouTube is exploding, and like...
[456.32 → 457.72] Is Fortnite not for teenagers?
[458.68 → 459.02] Oof.
[460.20 → 460.64] Oof.
[461.74 → 464.48] I mean, it featured very prominently in the Rewind,
[464.62 → 465.66] and as far as I could...
[465.66 → 467.42] I mean, I went to the Halloween store,
[467.50 → 470.08] and there were Fortnite costumes.
[471.08 → 473.28] They didn't have adult sizes.
[475.86 → 478.24] I'm thinking they probably know their demographic.
[479.24 → 480.30] Yeah, I...
[480.30 → 482.62] Oh, this WAN show's gotten real uncomfortable.
[484.26 → 487.50] I think with Rewind,
[487.56 → 489.96] they're trying to make it extremely advertiser-friendly,
[490.82 → 493.62] and they're trying to bring in safe acts,
[493.70 → 494.66] and for some reason,
[495.04 → 497.24] they're no longer trying to just show
[497.24 → 501.02] really cool or important or high-view things
[501.02 → 501.96] that happen throughout the year.
[502.10 → 503.38] They're just trying to take people
[503.38 → 504.42] that are advertiser-friendly
[504.42 → 505.82] and put them in front of the screen.
[505.82 → 508.12] Like, I love that Marquez had a speaking part.
[508.28 → 508.94] That's really cool.
[509.48 → 511.66] But I almost would have liked it better
[511.66 → 512.72] if he was just, like,
[513.16 → 514.78] sitting on one of the seats on the bus,
[514.86 → 515.86] like, talking about his phone
[515.86 → 516.90] and, like, showing it to someone
[516.90 → 518.60] as they had panned along it.
[519.62 → 521.36] Like, I love that he had a speaking part,
[521.44 → 522.86] but it felt off-topic.
[523.14 → 524.44] Or if he had a speaking part,
[524.48 → 525.70] I would have liked for it to be...
[525.70 → 526.90] Yeah, that's the thing.
[526.90 → 527.70] Because if you don't know that he's a tech guy...
[527.70 → 527.72] Yeah, that's the thing.
[527.72 → 528.86] It's so unrelated, yeah.
[529.20 → 532.12] You won't have any idea from watching Rewind.
[532.20 → 533.44] Another thing, in my opinion,
[533.52 → 534.98] if they're going to do it this way,
[535.10 → 536.12] which I disagree with,
[536.18 → 537.30] but if they're going to do it this way,
[537.36 → 540.08] where they just, like, scattershot popular people
[540.08 → 541.84] that are brand-friendly into the video,
[541.94 → 544.02] they should have little things.
[545.14 → 546.40] Like, this is this person.
[547.54 → 547.84] Yeah.
[547.90 → 548.64] Because you watch the thing,
[548.66 → 548.94] and you're like,
[548.94 → 550.18] who are all these people?
[550.50 → 553.24] And maybe the person's on there for 60 frames.
[553.80 → 555.08] Like, you barely see them.
[555.08 → 557.94] But that's where I think the context comes in as well,
[558.02 → 559.66] because at least that would help.
[559.66 → 560.18] Yeah, that would help.
[560.34 → 560.86] That would help.
[560.94 → 561.72] It's kind of like,
[561.78 → 563.68] does anyone remember when you're a kid, right?
[564.22 → 566.40] And you're in the grocery store with your parents,
[566.76 → 569.44] and, like, one of your teachers is standing there,
[569.50 → 571.42] like, comparing, you know,
[571.46 → 572.86] the quality of, like, apples or whatever,
[572.90 → 574.28] and you're like...
[574.28 → 576.04] You exist in real life?
[576.10 → 576.98] Mrs. Fraser?
[577.22 → 577.42] Yeah.
[577.42 → 578.96] Shops at the grocery store?
[580.82 → 584.82] Because when you see somebody outside the normal context,
[584.82 → 586.40] that you expect to see them in,
[586.68 → 589.50] it's very easy to not recognize them,
[589.52 → 591.74] and this can even be true of people that you know in real life.
[591.92 → 592.06] Yeah.
[592.20 → 594.28] Like, if I ran into...
[594.28 → 598.06] You know, I'm not going to pick someone that I work with every day.
[598.16 → 599.64] Like, if I ran into Luke on the street,
[599.84 → 601.28] obviously I'm going to...
[601.28 → 602.04] Okay, even then, though,
[602.04 → 603.58] if we ran into each other on the street...
[603.58 → 604.28] Okay, oh, wait.
[604.38 → 605.40] I'm going to use a story for this.
[605.40 → 607.10] I ran into Dimitri in Germany.
[607.98 → 608.30] Okay.
[608.52 → 609.96] I had no idea Dimitri was in Germany.
[609.96 → 611.46] Dimitri from Hardware Connects, just for context.
[611.46 → 612.72] I had no idea he was in Germany.
[612.78 → 612.92] Sure.
[612.92 → 614.24] He had no idea I was in Germany.
[614.42 → 616.22] We walk past each other randomly on the street,
[616.36 → 617.70] and it takes a second,
[618.30 → 618.92] because you're like,
[619.20 → 621.00] this doesn't make any sense at all.
[621.06 → 621.32] Right.
[621.94 → 622.94] Like, what?
[623.22 → 624.58] Like, I totally knew who he was,
[624.64 → 626.36] but I was like, is this a doppelgänger?
[626.50 → 627.02] Like, what's...
[627.02 → 628.06] It's a weird moment.
[628.14 → 628.68] It's very jarring.
[629.58 → 630.38] People are like, what?
[630.46 → 631.14] Yeah, that happened.
[631.82 → 632.56] That's pretty cool.
[632.60 → 633.76] That was a really cool idea.
[634.16 → 634.34] Yeah.
[634.34 → 636.62] So...
[636.62 → 637.30] This was a long time.
[637.40 → 637.86] I don't know.
[637.98 → 639.56] I only made it about halfway through,
[639.66 → 642.16] just because, like, it's not really...
[642.16 → 644.02] It's kind of the same reason that I don't watch,
[644.10 → 645.52] like, the Grammys and the Oscars,
[645.60 → 647.52] because a lot of the time it's movies and songs,
[647.64 → 649.40] movies I haven't seen, songs I haven't heard,
[649.82 → 651.94] and people who I don't really know who they are.
[652.26 → 653.86] Like, there's a handful of, like,
[653.94 → 656.46] very famous actors and or musicians.
[656.60 → 658.92] Musicians in particular, I don't watch music videos.
[659.40 → 662.52] It's not like I have an objection to them or anything.
[662.52 → 663.72] I just...
[663.72 → 664.62] When I listen to music,
[664.74 → 666.76] it's usually when I'm doing something else,
[666.88 → 668.16] and that doing something else
[668.16 → 670.72] isn't staring straight ahead at the screen
[670.72 → 672.50] watching the video that goes with it.
[672.54 → 674.36] It's like something actually totally unrelated.
[675.44 → 676.84] So I actually...
[676.84 → 680.30] A lot of the time, I don't recognize musicians.
[680.52 → 680.64] Yeah.
[681.92 → 684.98] And so I just...
[684.98 → 686.88] Like, I just don't find it that interesting.
[687.14 → 688.66] I don't really follow the storylines.
[688.76 → 690.62] Like, I don't really pay attention to celebrity gossip
[690.62 → 691.54] or anything like that.
[691.54 → 691.58] Yeah.
[691.88 → 694.52] So it's just not fascinating for me
[694.52 → 696.00] to just see a parade of people
[696.00 → 697.64] that I don't really know who the crap they are
[697.64 → 698.30] or why I should care.
[698.44 → 698.68] Yeah.
[698.82 → 700.54] Like, I liked seeing Marques
[700.54 → 702.26] because it was cool having someone featured
[702.26 → 704.10] really prominently that's in our community.
[704.44 → 704.62] Yeah.
[705.16 → 707.12] And it was hilarious to see
[707.12 → 709.06] that PewDiePie's chair made it in,
[709.16 → 710.30] but he didn't.
[710.94 → 712.38] That was really entertaining.
[713.20 → 715.54] One of the animators that was featured...
[715.54 → 715.78] Yeah.
[715.84 → 717.88] Had the chair doing this, but then...
[717.88 → 719.06] No, it's just...
[719.06 → 721.02] It's them, like, moving in a room,
[721.54 → 722.52] like, going in front of the camera
[722.52 → 722.82] and be like,
[722.86 → 724.22] hey, and then, like, moving away.
[724.34 → 725.28] And it's all animated.
[725.60 → 726.24] It's a little cartoon.
[726.52 → 726.66] Yeah.
[726.72 → 727.78] But the chair that they're in
[727.78 → 730.02] is very clearly PewDiePie's, like,
[730.14 → 730.76] clutch chair
[730.76 → 733.08] with the like, swirly red and black design.
[733.18 → 733.60] Got it.
[733.60 → 736.58] It's, uh...
[736.58 → 740.18] It's kind of an interesting call-out
[740.18 → 740.88] that happened there.
[741.36 → 741.72] All right.
[741.78 → 742.94] The Last Days says,
[743.02 → 744.78] can you guys talk about something that matters?
[744.98 → 745.18] Yeah.
[745.18 → 747.40] Like, the fact that Jesus is coming back very soon
[747.40 → 749.06] and the whole world is going to suffer judgment.
[749.98 → 750.58] All right.
[750.66 → 752.50] So let's move on, then, from that topic,
[752.50 → 755.54] and let's move on to the big announcement
[755.54 → 757.48] for this WAN show.
[757.70 → 758.98] Oh, oh, my goodness.
[758.98 → 759.88] I'm actually so excited.
[760.12 → 761.34] The actual big announcement.
[761.46 → 761.64] Wow.
[761.88 → 762.30] It's funny.
[762.30 → 765.04] We have made it 20 minutes into the WAN show,
[765.20 → 767.98] and I have not even opened up the Topics' doc yet.
[768.80 → 770.90] That may be a new record.
[772.56 → 773.76] I'm extremely...
[773.76 → 774.94] Like, I might be more excited
[774.94 → 777.14] than the people in the audience about this.
[777.78 → 779.04] LTX 2019.
[779.44 → 779.58] Woo!
[780.34 → 783.22] The details are somewhat coming together.
[783.44 → 783.62] Woo!
[783.88 → 784.24] Okay.
[784.40 → 786.88] First, mark your calendars now.
[787.34 → 787.48] Yeah.
[787.76 → 790.76] July 27th and 28th.
[790.78 → 791.22] Two days!
[791.22 → 791.56] Whoa!
[791.76 → 791.92] What?
[792.30 → 792.78] Two days!
[792.86 → 793.32] Two days?
[793.82 → 794.60] Well, hold on a second.
[794.76 → 798.04] Surely they're going to kick us out of the venue overnight, right?
[798.60 → 799.64] Wait, what?
[799.90 → 800.40] Wrong!
[800.60 → 800.90] What?
[801.28 → 802.38] I didn't even know this.
[802.54 → 803.70] Oh, that's so cool.
[803.96 → 805.10] I'm so excited.
[805.36 → 811.26] LTX 2019 is going to be bigger, badder, and better than ever.
[811.42 → 811.94] Two days.
[811.94 → 812.70] Oh, my God.
[812.70 → 814.44] With an overnight LAN party.
[814.44 → 815.60] Oh, my God.
[816.44 → 817.60] Powered by...
[817.60 → 818.50] Oh, my God.
[818.50 → 821.46] Our partner for the event, Dream hack.
[821.56 → 822.04] Yes!
[822.34 → 822.54] Woo!
[822.54 → 823.66] That's so cool!
[823.66 → 824.40] Oh, my God.
[824.40 → 824.50] Oh, my God.
[824.50 → 829.22] So, we have been working on this with them since basically...
[829.22 → 829.96] Oh, man.
[829.96 → 832.80] The end of LTX 2018 when we went, you know what?
[832.80 → 841.64] We did a lot of stuff that was better than last year, but there is still a ton of room for improvement here.
[841.64 → 843.66] So cool.
[843.78 → 845.30] I can't give you guys...
[845.30 → 849.96] But basically, we were like, yeah, we need to take it up a significant notch.
[850.08 → 850.74] This is 2-11.
[850.76 → 856.16] If we want this to be more than just a fan meetup, which it has done a great job of being...
[856.16 → 856.36] Oh, yeah.
[856.56 → 862.28] But last year, we had other creators there, like, crawling out of the woodwork.
[862.58 → 863.72] No, we had Steve from Gamers Nexus.
[863.86 → 864.74] We had Jay's Two Cents.
[864.82 → 865.76] We had Barnacles there.
[865.84 → 866.90] We had Louis Grossman there.
[867.10 → 869.30] And we're kind of looking at this going, well, hold on a second.
[870.12 → 871.22] Those guys came.
[871.72 → 872.72] They had fun.
[873.22 → 874.18] All of them...
[874.18 → 881.92] And, you know, I'm not going to put words in their mouths, but all of them expressed interest in at least maybe participating in 2019.
[882.32 → 885.32] So, we're looking at it going like, hey, well, we need to...
[885.32 → 892.74] If we're going to have big creators coming in and being sort of part of this experience, we need a creator meetup space.
[892.80 → 895.04] And we need better food options.
[895.22 → 897.20] We need a bigger space.
[897.68 → 898.98] So, guess what?
[899.30 → 900.62] We got a bigger space.
[900.92 → 902.20] We are stepping it up.
[902.34 → 903.52] We're moving into the big time.
[903.66 → 910.90] So, the original plan was to take, I think it was a couple of the ballrooms or a couple of the...
[910.90 → 918.24] Like, three of the meeting rooms and then one of the ballrooms or something like that in the I want to say, east building of the Vancouver Convention Centre.
[918.62 → 919.18] So, we actually...
[919.18 → 919.32] Oh, yeah.
[919.38 → 920.68] We went even further than that.
[920.74 → 921.78] Not a hockey rink this time.
[921.78 → 926.94] And with no plan, really, for exactly how we're going to fill it.
[927.16 → 931.24] Other than that, we're just going to take a lot of what we've done, a lot of new ideas from the community.
[931.32 → 932.66] Oh, they're getting so much booth space.
[932.88 → 934.78] So, we're making every booth bigger.
[935.26 → 935.60] Good.
[935.72 → 936.60] Every booth better.
[936.60 → 943.50] And we are going to have something to the tune of, like, 30,000 square feet or something ridiculous like that.
[943.56 → 946.68] It is going to be a gigantic space.
[946.68 → 952.68] I think I can say that we are going to have...
[953.72 → 954.20] You know what?
[954.26 → 961.18] I'm going to check what is in the blog because we have actually added a blog to the LTX...
[961.18 → 962.44] LTXexpo.com.
[963.02 → 964.94] Oh, hold on just a minute here.
[965.66 → 966.36] Oh, you're showing the duck.
[966.74 → 967.30] Yeah, that's fine.
[967.30 → 967.90] Not that it really matters.
[968.70 → 969.88] Oh, have we not?
[969.98 → 971.18] Have we not done it yet?
[971.72 → 971.88] Oh.
[972.84 → 973.22] Look at that.
[973.58 → 974.30] December 7th.
[974.30 → 974.52] Wow.
[974.72 → 975.98] This is a really great website.
[976.00 → 976.48] Very broken.
[976.48 → 977.20] There we go.
[978.08 → 980.74] LTX 2019 and Dream Hack coming to Vancouver.
[981.04 → 981.68] So cool.
[981.96 → 983.16] This page could be better, but don't worry.
[983.44 → 984.92] We're busy making the event good.
[985.00 → 987.12] We don't have time to make this thing good.
[988.10 → 988.92] Huge partnership.
[989.36 → 990.92] Thrilled to be partnering with 3.5 World Record.
[992.84 → 993.20] Okay.
[993.72 → 995.26] Well, man, I kind of...
[995.26 → 995.54] You know what?
[995.56 → 997.60] I'm going to jump the gun a little bit.
[998.96 → 1000.04] There's going to be a BYOC.
[1003.34 → 1004.84] But we're partnering with Dream Hack.
[1004.84 → 1005.88] I thought that was, like, a given.
[1006.16 → 1007.00] Well, they do other things.
[1007.30 → 1007.58] Okay.
[1008.04 → 1008.30] Okay.
[1008.68 → 1010.12] So there's going to be a BYOC LAN.
[1010.12 → 1010.90] Do you know how many seats?
[1011.12 → 1011.70] Can we say how many seats?
[1011.70 → 1012.72] I know, but we can't say.
[1012.76 → 1012.96] Okay.
[1013.12 → 1013.30] Okay.
[1013.40 → 1014.46] Because you never know.
[1014.58 → 1021.98] There could be, like, a slight seating rearrangement or power restrictions or whatever.
[1022.22 → 1022.44] Sure.
[1022.44 → 1023.22] You never know.
[1023.30 → 1023.68] You never know.
[1023.72 → 1025.04] There are still a lot of details to work out.
[1025.24 → 1025.66] That makes sense.
[1025.66 → 1028.72] But we have paid the deposit on the Vancouver Convention Centre.
[1029.36 → 1031.32] It will be in the Vancouver Convention Centre.
[1031.96 → 1035.90] So there will be way better access to hotels and transportation.
[1036.56 → 1038.36] You can take the Sky Train there.
[1038.82 → 1039.60] Tons of food.
[1039.86 → 1041.84] Like, it's just going to be better.
[1041.84 → 1041.92] Yeah.
[1042.12 → 1042.88] PAX West.
[1043.02 → 1043.24] Yeah.
[1043.42 → 1045.84] For, as far as I can tell, my entire life.
[1046.58 → 1049.90] I think the next one will be my, like, 12th or 13th event.
[1050.04 → 1051.68] I lost track somewhere along the line.
[1051.68 → 1055.16] I'm really excited.
[1055.38 → 1060.50] I'm potentially, I'm willing to say I'm more excited about this event than PAX.
[1060.84 → 1063.70] Which is, like, that's a very hard thing for me to say.
[1063.98 → 1064.86] You're kind of a PAX fan.
[1065.02 → 1065.90] I am kind of a PAX fan.
[1065.90 → 1066.54] If you're being honest.
[1066.68 → 1066.84] Yeah.
[1067.18 → 1067.34] Yeah.
[1067.74 → 1072.12] But, like, LTX is legitimately, and I'm not even technically a part of Lines peer group anymore.
[1072.26 → 1075.04] So I have no real technical incentives to even say this.
[1075.36 → 1079.26] LTX is doing everything that I think they should do.
[1079.62 → 1081.34] Partnering with Dream Hack is a perfect idea.
[1081.34 → 1081.42] Yeah.
[1081.72 → 1083.82] Making the event two days is a perfect idea.
[1083.92 → 1085.22] A lot of people are flying in.
[1085.52 → 1088.36] Flying in for one, like, Irtish hour segment.
[1088.36 → 1089.00] We know.
[1089.42 → 1089.68] Yeah.
[1089.82 → 1089.98] Yeah.
[1090.06 → 1090.20] Yeah.
[1090.20 → 1090.40] Yeah.
[1090.44 → 1094.76] We always knew it was just the venues and the costs.
[1095.30 → 1096.12] It makes sense.
[1096.22 → 1100.90] So this year, quite honestly, what, okay.
[1101.58 → 1103.10] Luke's the biggest User ever.
[1103.52 → 1104.00] No.
[1104.34 → 1106.98] The directive to Colton.
[1106.98 → 1111.00] So the directive to Colton previously was breakeven.
[1111.34 → 1112.02] Right.
[1112.12 → 1112.54] On the event.
[1112.68 → 1117.54] We didn't expect it to make money, but we didn't really want to lose a bunch of money.
[1117.84 → 1129.14] The directive this year is, look, Linus Media Group and Linus Tech Tips doesn't really do a ton of marketing and, quite frankly, a ton of community engagement.
[1129.38 → 1129.54] Yeah.
[1129.54 → 1136.34] So this is our community engagement budget for the year.
[1137.30 → 1137.96] Blow it.
[1138.94 → 1139.74] Blow it all.
[1140.38 → 1140.74] Hell yeah.
[1140.86 → 1142.42] So we are already engaging.
[1142.42 → 1143.10] It's going to be so cool.
[1143.10 → 1147.84] We're already engaging with, like, actual professional booth building and designing companies.
[1148.04 → 1151.80] I can't promise we'll use them, but we will at least get some inspiration from them.
[1153.20 → 1157.52] We really, really want to take it to a completely different level this year.
[1157.52 → 1164.34] The thing is, there's, I can't really think of any conventions, at least in North America, that are hardware focused.
[1164.58 → 1168.78] Not that there won't be games there, but it's hardware focused and it's a community event.
[1169.20 → 1171.10] And there definitely might be games there.
[1171.62 → 1171.78] Yeah.
[1172.50 → 1176.86] PAX has become less, and less hardware focused over time.
[1177.12 → 1177.28] Yeah.
[1177.34 → 1180.60] They've been more and more gaming, and it's more and more like giant AAA companies.
[1180.74 → 1182.70] It's not as, like, smaller company.
[1182.70 → 1183.98] It's much less hands-on.
[1184.16 → 1186.34] To be clear, we're aware of the indie zone.
[1187.12 → 1187.24] Yeah.
[1187.58 → 1189.62] But, okay.
[1189.94 → 1200.60] If, if, I'm not promising anything, but if we had any indie developers show up to, you know, show off their wares at LTX 2019,
[1201.08 → 1206.52] there would be a hard and fast rule that you have to have a booth that doesn't suck.
[1206.92 → 1208.02] And I get it.
[1208.12 → 1209.98] You're an indie developer and it's hard.
[1209.98 → 1227.36] We would be happy to help, but you can't just have a table with, like, a vinyl banner behind you and, like, I hate to stereotype, but, like, two nerdy guys sitting there at the desk with some business card.
[1227.54 → 1227.82] No.
[1229.00 → 1229.98] It has to be playable.
[1230.66 → 1232.00] It has to be cool.
[1233.12 → 1235.34] It has to be, like, it has to not suck.
[1236.14 → 1236.88] That's all I'm asking.
[1237.06 → 1237.16] Yeah.
[1237.16 → 1237.24] Yeah.
[1238.32 → 1238.60] So.
[1238.70 → 1242.78] It's just, I'm, I'm, I'm extremely intrinsically excited about this LTX.
[1242.98 → 1249.82] I think the, the main things I wanted to be improved is, like, the lines were crazy at last one.
[1249.82 → 1251.66] And, and the main stage was.
[1251.94 → 1252.16] Okay.
[1252.26 → 1253.80] So VR had what?
[1253.92 → 1254.80] Three headsets?
[1255.04 → 1255.32] Yeah.
[1255.46 → 1260.32] So we figured the minimum for this coming year is somewhere between 15 and 20.
[1260.66 → 1260.96] Yeah.
[1261.08 → 1262.16] Like, that's insane.
[1262.50 → 1263.38] And, but makes sense.
[1263.48 → 1263.76] Massive booth.
[1263.90 → 1264.20] Makes sense.
[1264.20 → 1269.82] And we just kind of, like, we kind of, like, lay it out, like, so that you can make it
[1269.82 → 1270.86] somewhat space efficient.
[1270.86 → 1273.36] But, like, yeah.
[1273.60 → 1274.30] We, we know.
[1274.56 → 1274.90] Absolutely.
[1275.22 → 1276.06] Like, we know.
[1276.36 → 1276.98] I'm so excited.
[1276.98 → 1279.26] We know we screwed up a lot of stuff last year.
[1279.26 → 1281.20] Well, I don't, I don't necessarily think it's screwed up.
[1281.20 → 1281.56] People had fun.
[1281.82 → 1281.94] Yeah.
[1281.94 → 1283.54] But they had a lot of constructive criticism.
[1283.78 → 1283.98] Yeah.
[1284.10 → 1284.86] But I don't think it's screwed up.
[1284.98 → 1286.14] It's our second convention.
[1286.42 → 1287.54] It's not Tana Con.
[1287.66 → 1290.34] It's not, like, the whatever that Tumblr convention was.
[1290.46 → 1291.24] Like, it succeeded.
[1291.24 → 1292.10] People were happy.
[1292.24 → 1293.32] It's just growing pains.
[1293.40 → 1297.12] And I'm just super excited about this year's upgrade.
[1297.46 → 1303.70] It was thrilling to me that people showed up to LTX 2018 with, like, signed stuff from
[1303.70 → 1307.76] LTX 2017 wanting to get it, like, signed again.
[1307.86 → 1315.14] Like, where there's already that grassroots sort of movement to make this sort of worth
[1315.14 → 1316.14] migrating for.
[1316.14 → 1318.52] And we know that Vancouver is not easy.
[1318.82 → 1323.48] But that's one of the reasons that we're announcing it way earlier this time around.
[1323.56 → 1331.42] You have literally seven months to get a passport or figure out time off or whatever else.
[1331.50 → 1336.30] We're also doing it for two days so that it is somewhat justifiable to come up here.
[1337.64 → 1339.08] Vancouver's a beautiful city.
[1339.82 → 1340.76] Give it a chance.
[1340.94 → 1343.06] We're doing it in the summer for a couple of reasons.
[1343.06 → 1345.26] Number one is so that people aren't in school.
[1345.70 → 1350.44] And remember, that applies to both, you know, younger people and older people who are also
[1350.44 → 1351.06] in school.
[1351.70 → 1354.56] So we're doing it in July so that people aren't in school.
[1354.66 → 1359.04] We're also doing it in July because the weather tends to be absolutely fantastic here in July
[1359.04 → 1361.82] if you're into hiking, if you're into food.
[1362.06 → 1363.94] Vancouver's a great place to go for food.
[1364.84 → 1365.88] Whether you, I mean, pretty much.
[1365.88 → 1366.18] In Richmond.
[1366.18 → 1376.82] I get so spoiled because living in Vancouver, whether I travel to Asia or the U.S. or like
[1376.82 → 1380.50] pretty much anywhere, it's like, yeah, yeah, food's great.
[1380.62 → 1384.00] But like, honestly, it's not that different from if I just go to like an authentic place
[1384.00 → 1384.40] back home.
[1384.40 → 1384.62] There's probably a shop.
[1384.66 → 1387.70] Yeah, there's probably a shop not that far away that I get essentially exactly this.
[1387.70 → 1389.86] Indian food, Chinese food, Japanese food.
[1390.56 → 1393.32] Dennis said the Chinese food is better here.
[1393.32 → 1402.08] Like, okay, I could get on, I could get into a whole thing about sort of like meat quality.
[1402.34 → 1402.52] Yeah.
[1403.78 → 1405.86] I know where that conversation goes.
[1406.52 → 1411.50] Spent enough time in Asia for like people talk about, yeah, food's cheap in Asia.
[1411.50 → 1418.62] And I'm like, okay, there's a difference between food being cheap and cheap food being cheap.
[1418.62 → 1424.32] I had the most horrifying hamburger.
[1424.44 → 1426.08] And I know that's what I get for ordering hamburger.
[1426.52 → 1431.76] But I had just about the most horrifying hamburger in like Brunei or something stupid like that.
[1431.82 → 1433.86] It was like, look, it was a moment of weakness.
[1433.86 → 1435.40] It was like halfway through my trip.
[1435.46 → 1436.84] It was the trip from hell.
[1437.20 → 1439.74] We had two six-month-old infants with us.
[1440.04 → 1442.66] Like we were there because someone in the family was dying.
[1443.10 → 1444.24] Turns out they weren't dying.
[1444.32 → 1445.06] He's still alive.
[1445.14 → 1446.50] And that was like four years ago.
[1446.50 → 1451.76] So anyway, look, the point is like it was the worst.
[1452.50 → 1458.68] And even the more authentic things because the entire rest of the trip I had to eat more authentic stuff
[1458.68 → 1461.04] because I was with my wife and all of her family.
[1461.14 → 1465.76] And we weren't going to go to like the white people friendly place because of the one white.
[1465.78 → 1468.42] Actually, there were two white guys there, me and my brother-in-law.
[1469.12 → 1471.46] And anyway, we weren't going to go there just because of us.
[1471.50 → 1472.96] We were like, okay, we're going to make the best of it.
[1472.96 → 1477.16] And I was actually far less open-minded about authentic food at that point.
[1477.30 → 1478.46] It was rough.
[1478.68 → 1481.78] So everything else honestly was not great either.
[1482.10 → 1487.68] I was like, yeah, no, I can understand why this doesn't cost very much because it's like very low grade.
[1488.42 → 1490.42] And that, yep, that's fine.
[1490.60 → 1491.44] Some stuff was perfect.
[1491.56 → 1492.34] Some stuff was perfect.
[1492.40 → 1493.00] There were exceptions.
[1493.00 → 1497.02] But food in Vancouver is great.
[1497.22 → 1498.42] So LTX.
[1498.58 → 1504.38] So don't think of it as like you have to buy a plane ticket just to go to like a one-day convention because A.
[1505.22 → 1506.00] It's two days now.
[1506.04 → 1506.90] It's two days now.
[1507.08 → 1507.36] And B.
[1507.36 → 1511.06] And it goes overnight, which is something conventions haven't done in a long time.
[1511.06 → 1516.20] And it's actually really cool because at like three or four in the morning at a convention, the whole vibe changes.
[1516.56 → 1516.70] Okay.
[1516.76 → 1520.08] So to be clear, the actual booths will not be open overnight.
[1520.08 → 1521.34] It'll be the BROWN area.
[1521.34 → 1522.86] I'm sure that's how it works everywhere.
[1522.96 → 1523.60] That's completely fine.
[1523.76 → 1525.94] But like the whole vibe at the convention changes.
[1526.04 → 1527.24] It's really, really cool.
[1527.46 → 1529.84] I suggest trying to stay up for a while.
[1530.02 → 1532.90] I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it.
[1533.42 → 1535.02] I probably will.
[1535.58 → 1536.04] Okay.
[1536.08 → 1538.36] Because like I'm going to be on stage a lot.
[1538.80 → 1539.96] You probably shouldn't.
[1539.96 → 1540.34] Both day one and day two.
[1540.36 → 1541.14] Even if you could.
[1541.38 → 1545.20] And the night of the first day, I got my Backstreet Boys concert.
[1545.74 → 1546.88] I heard about that.
[1547.06 → 1548.96] You're actually going to leave LTX to go there.
[1548.96 → 1551.94] Look, the concert was booked first.
[1551.94 → 1552.04] Wow.
[1552.54 → 1555.22] They moved the dates for LTX on me.
[1556.16 → 1557.32] I didn't have anything.
[1557.32 → 1557.66] Wow.
[1557.94 → 1560.60] Look, I never saw them when they were relevant.
[1561.26 → 1561.62] So.
[1562.14 → 1562.56] Wow.
[1562.88 → 1563.78] I want to see the.
[1563.90 → 1564.74] Look, look, look.
[1564.84 → 1566.40] I'll be there all day during the day.
[1566.40 → 1567.60] It has your name on it.
[1567.60 → 1568.82] All day during the day.
[1569.76 → 1570.98] No, I don't think it does.
[1571.02 → 1571.32] Does it?
[1571.38 → 1571.60] Oh.
[1571.96 → 1572.26] I think.
[1572.34 → 1573.52] Isn't that for Linus Tech Tips?
[1573.98 → 1575.04] Which is technically like a.
[1575.14 → 1576.56] It's more of a brand than my name.
[1576.64 → 1577.60] It's at least two thirds.
[1577.60 → 1578.30] Your name is in it.
[1578.32 → 1579.44] Your name is in it.
[1579.46 → 1580.66] It's at least two thirds not my name.
[1580.68 → 1582.16] You like to say your name's on the building.
[1582.28 → 1582.68] Well, I just.
[1583.26 → 1587.26] Yeah, that's just me like playing that, you know, as shat character that I play.
[1587.40 → 1587.96] But that's it.
[1587.96 → 1588.52] Yeah, that's Luke.
[1588.74 → 1589.06] See, Luke.
[1589.06 → 1589.44] I don't know.
[1593.44 → 1593.80] Anyway.
[1594.50 → 1595.72] So I'll go for the concert.
[1596.12 → 1598.34] And then what I may do is come back for a bit.
[1598.52 → 1600.02] But I can't like to stay up all night.
[1600.20 → 1601.14] No, you should sleep.
[1601.14 → 1604.66] I like to have to be on stage and like meet and greeting things.
[1604.72 → 1606.80] It will probably make the show better if you sleep.
[1607.22 → 1607.66] But I.
[1608.84 → 1611.26] I'm probably going to buy a BYOC ticket anyway.
[1611.64 → 1614.42] Just so that hopefully I can get in and play some games and stuff.
[1615.08 → 1615.46] Oh, right.
[1615.54 → 1615.78] Because.
[1616.04 → 1616.80] Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[1616.84 → 1618.10] Well, no, I could get a free ticket.
[1618.10 → 1620.00] But for me, it's just more the principle of the thing.
[1620.20 → 1621.18] I'll just buy a ticket.
[1621.50 → 1623.66] Like there's going to be a finite number of seats.
[1624.18 → 1626.94] And so if I was like, yeah, you know, I want a free ticket.
[1627.02 → 1628.00] My brother wants a free ticket.
[1628.08 → 1629.26] And all my staff need free tickets.
[1629.26 → 1631.98] And it's like, you know, this is a partnership.
[1632.36 → 1632.50] Yeah.
[1632.58 → 1636.06] We need to make sure that it makes sense for Dream Hack.
[1636.12 → 1639.18] And it makes sense for Linus Media Group.
[1640.28 → 1645.52] Because, you know, who knows, you know, what this kind of turns into or doesn't turn into.
[1645.74 → 1648.58] This is, I think, pretty experimental for both of us.
[1648.76 → 1648.90] Oh, yeah.
[1649.26 → 1649.40] Yeah.
[1649.40 → 1651.92] So, yeah, we're really excited, though.
[1651.94 → 1652.82] Are they doing like tournaments and stuff?
[1653.20 → 1659.06] I think their approach is going to be relatively low-key this time.
[1659.20 → 1659.46] Okay.
[1659.60 → 1662.32] I don't want to promise anything on their behalf.
[1662.34 → 1663.56] I don't mean like big professional tournaments.
[1663.68 → 1665.08] I mean like, are they going to do like.
[1665.24 → 1666.40] I really don't know.
[1666.50 → 1669.42] I would love to like impromptu should cast a Rocket League tournament.
[1669.80 → 1671.24] Because I've actually done this before.
[1671.58 → 1671.86] Really?
[1672.06 → 1672.30] Yeah.
[1672.52 → 1672.76] Okay.
[1672.80 → 1674.86] And I actually think I'm pretty decent at it for Rocket League.
[1674.94 → 1675.24] Okay.
[1675.36 → 1676.28] And that would be really fun.
[1676.28 → 1681.14] Well, you know what, Colton, I think is watching WAN Show because he sent me this really upset message.
[1681.24 → 1682.98] I've been trying to fix the blog for an hour.
[1683.16 → 1686.96] Well, so I'm sure he heard you say that.
[1687.12 → 1692.62] Colton, if you want any amount of free help or labour outside standard hours, I'm down to do whatever.
[1692.98 → 1695.90] I will sacrifice my body to try to make LTX better.
[1696.58 → 1697.60] I'm not even kidding.
[1697.78 → 1702.76] One thing that might help us make LTX better is making sure that we get through our sponsors for the WAN Show today.
[1702.76 → 1707.04] Because if we don't survive until, you know, the next LTX, then.
[1707.12 → 1707.88] That would be a shame.
[1707.96 → 1708.56] Then that would be a shame.
[1708.60 → 1708.86] Don't worry.
[1708.92 → 1709.16] We're fine.
[1709.50 → 1712.28] So first up is the Plato Mini Stream Deck.
[1712.60 → 1716.82] It allows you to concentrate on your stream instead of trying to memorize keyboard shortcuts or fussing around with the mouse.
[1717.14 → 1718.56] Why did they put it down there?
[1718.82 → 1720.42] I didn't even know it was here.
[1720.48 → 1721.98] I didn't know they set one of these up here.
[1722.04 → 1722.82] This is awesome.
[1723.34 → 1725.72] Now I can switch to my screen.
[1726.10 → 1727.26] You can see my talking points.
[1727.26 → 1728.48] I'm mildly concerned it's not set up.
[1728.52 → 1729.58] They broke it.
[1730.48 → 1731.50] Well, whatever.
[1731.64 → 1732.50] It looks like it's set up.
[1732.50 → 1733.18] It does work.
[1733.36 → 1734.68] Because this is awesome.
[1734.94 → 1735.52] So check this out.
[1735.60 → 1738.76] Every single one of the buttons is a little LCD.
[1738.86 → 1739.84] You can't see that at all.
[1739.98 → 1742.14] So you can actually see me and Luke there.
[1742.48 → 1744.04] You can see what it's supposed to be.
[1744.10 → 1745.40] So you don't have to memorize anything.
[1745.68 → 1748.58] And you can program them to do pretty much anything that you could want.
[1748.64 → 1749.58] So you just click the button.
[1750.40 → 1756.26] And whether you want to, you know, graphically, excuse me, whether you want to, body help,
[1756.30 → 1760.78] whether you want to like switch scenes in a stream or whether you want to execute a macro in Adobe Premiere,
[1761.00 → 1766.46] which is what Taken uses the two of them that he has at his desk for, you can do it on the stream deck.
[1766.46 → 1767.34] They're less than $100.
[1767.70 → 1769.24] They're available for Mac or Windows.
[1769.34 → 1775.38] And you can learn more at the link in the, well, they don't have it in our lower third, but that's okay.
[1775.48 → 1775.88] They'll learn.
[1776.60 → 1777.00] FreshBooks.
[1777.24 → 1781.86] FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool for small business owners and freelancers
[1781.86 → 1785.22] that does a lot more than just help you create and send slick looking invoices.
[1785.66 → 1789.22] You can track your time with their timesheet function, manage your expenses.
[1789.22 → 1791.00] That is such an inside joke at this point.
[1791.46 → 1794.34] Manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what.
[1794.44 → 1798.66] It also has a feature that tells you when your client looks at an invoice for the first time.
[1799.00 → 1801.40] Their mobile app has all the functionality of the desktop version,
[1801.50 → 1803.72] so you can take FreshBooks with you wherever you go.
[1803.72 → 1806.52] And accounting can be confusing.
[1807.24 → 1809.60] FreshBooks is all about helping with that.
[1809.68 → 1810.80] It's about making it simple.
[1810.90 → 1816.48] And if you have any questions, you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real human being.
[1816.96 → 1823.24] No phone tree, no escalations, no return calls later, just answers to help you out.
[1823.24 → 1829.40] And as we learned in part one of our PC manufacturers trying to screw you or whatever we ended up calling that.
[1829.58 → 1830.60] Such a cool series.
[1831.38 → 1837.42] Just being able to talk to someone when you're frustrated can make all the difference.
[1837.80 → 1842.82] So go to freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in how did you hear about us section.
[1842.82 → 1845.38] By the way, part two is on float plane already.
[1845.80 → 1846.84] It has been for a little while.
[1847.50 → 1849.80] Part three is coming to float plane on Tuesday as well.
[1850.16 → 1850.60] I'm excited.
[1850.90 → 1851.84] I'm really into that series.
[1851.86 → 1853.78] I'm going with the sweet sriracha barbecue today.
[1853.78 → 1854.80] Savage jerky!
[1855.56 → 1859.44] Their goal was to make a tasty jerky without nitrates or preservatives.
[1859.66 → 1862.92] That's not bad for you, but it's still full of flavour and spice.
[1863.02 → 1864.26] They've got 13 different flavours.
[1864.54 → 1866.10] My favourite is the maple buffalo bacon.
[1866.82 → 1867.66] Original is great.
[1867.66 → 1870.68] What's the green one?
[1871.52 → 1871.80] Mojo?
[1872.14 → 1873.76] Yeah, anything mojo is good.
[1874.16 → 1875.40] Mojo jalapeño is my favourite one.
[1875.48 → 1878.00] They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, a spice rub.
[1878.40 → 1881.54] Their Carolina Reaper hot sauces uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[1882.48 → 1883.22] The Carolina Reaper.

[1888.28 → 1890.70] We'll have that linked below if you're watching the archive.
[1891.68 → 1892.08] Alright.
[1892.38 → 1893.38] Should we do some tech news?
[1894.40 → 1896.10] We should probably talk about Ry zen 3000.
[1896.54 → 1897.32] Considering that's the title.
[1897.66 → 1898.06] Okay.
[1898.62 → 1898.92] Alright.
[1899.26 → 1899.58] Sounds good.
[1900.22 → 1902.60] So the original article is from Reddit, of all places.
[1903.42 → 1903.94] That makes sense.
[1907.08 → 1907.82] There you go.
[1909.10 → 1912.64] Ry zen 3000 will be on TSMC 7 nanometre HPC.
[1914.12 → 1915.64] So, basically...
[1915.64 → 1922.92] Ry zen 1000 and 2000 were built on Samsung's 14 nanometre low power process.
[1922.92 → 1928.30] This was part of the reason that there was a 4 gigahertz hard cap on clock speed.
[1928.30 → 1933.28] Like, Ry zen, Thread ripper, they are not overclockable.
[1933.36 → 1935.44] It's not that they're, like, hard to overclock.
[1935.44 → 1938.44] They're just not really overclockable.
[1938.44 → 1953.18] So, because of this limit in terms of their frequency, they had a really hard time making up any ground on Intel's processors, particularly in gaming, where single-threaded high clock speed performance is key.
[1953.18 → 1960.42] So, then two is rumoured to be made on TSMC's 7 nanometre high performance process.
[1960.42 → 1968.42] This could give us a 13% boost in clocks compared to low power's 4.6 gigahertz, putting Ry zen 3000 over 5 gigahertz.
[1968.96 → 1980.80] Along with this, we are expecting a 15% IPC improvement along with eight cores per CCX, which should mean less communication between the interconnects, and faster memory.
[1980.80 → 1996.72] So, if you were to extrapolate a 15% IPC, so that's instructions per clock uplift, plus a 15% improvement in the raw clock speed, that could be a 30% improvement in performance.
[1996.72 → 2007.20] It is also, sort of, anticipated that the Spectre Meltdown foreshadow hardware fixes will hit Intel about 10% harder than Ry zen.
[2007.40 → 2014.86] Meaning, it could be possible that Ry zen 3000 could be 10% faster than core in single-threaded workloads.
[2015.26 → 2020.48] This is according to, though, reddit.com slash r slash AMD stock.
[2020.48 → 2027.84] So, take it with more salt than was used to preserve this jerky.
[2028.28 → 2028.46] Yeah.
[2029.92 → 2031.48] I, uh...
[2031.48 → 2034.64] Do you own any tech stock?
[2035.16 → 2035.40] No.
[2036.12 → 2037.98] There's, you know the problems there.
[2038.22 → 2038.86] Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2038.96 → 2039.10] Yeah.
[2039.14 → 2039.32] Okay.
[2039.96 → 2040.64] Long story.
[2041.00 → 2041.88] Yeah, long story, actually.
[2042.22 → 2042.42] Yeah.
[2043.96 → 2044.64] So, no.
[2045.44 → 2046.64] But, like...
[2046.64 → 2051.08] It's actually been pretty wild lately.
[2051.34 → 2052.48] So, take this for what it is.
[2052.76 → 2061.54] The only times I have ever owned tech stock, um, I owned, like, a couple of thousand dollars of Nvidia, probably pre-lab.
[2061.72 → 2063.90] So, this must have been about eight years ago or something like that.
[2064.32 → 2071.58] And then I owned, like, I don't know, $5,000 or something like that of OCT shortly before they disappeared.
[2071.72 → 2072.02] No, don't.
[2072.12 → 2073.36] I was, I got out.
[2073.88 → 2074.60] Oh, okay.
[2074.78 → 2075.40] Yeah, I got out.
[2075.54 → 2075.82] Nice.
[2075.90 → 2076.16] All right.
[2076.16 → 2078.26] I actually, I made a little bit of money on that stock.
[2078.38 → 2080.68] And it was, like, kind of thrilling and it was cool.
[2080.80 → 2082.30] And I was, like, ooh, I'm, like, playing the market.
[2084.22 → 2086.52] Well, apparently you did okay with that if you got out before.
[2086.66 → 2086.84] Yeah.
[2086.92 → 2088.30] I made money on Nvidia as well.
[2089.04 → 2091.16] But I pulled out because...
[2092.00 → 2092.56] Well, okay.
[2092.66 → 2095.12] I pulled out because I was, like, I'm new to this.
[2095.22 → 2096.04] You know, I made some money.
[2096.12 → 2097.60] Okay, I'm gonna, like, call that good.
[2097.84 → 2097.98] Yeah.
[2098.12 → 2102.30] And then OCT completely went Supernova.
[2103.16 → 2105.10] And I was, like, you know what?
[2105.10 → 2106.48] F this.
[2106.64 → 2107.02] I'm out.
[2107.20 → 2107.86] I don't invest.
[2107.94 → 2110.72] So I didn't put any money back into Nvidia, which probably would have been a good idea.
[2110.80 → 2112.38] They were around $17 at that time.
[2112.80 → 2113.16] Yeah.
[2113.26 → 2113.44] Oops.
[2113.96 → 2114.32] Anyway.
[2115.06 → 2115.96] I mean, whatever.
[2116.08 → 2116.50] It's all game.
[2116.50 → 2122.68] Then I got into LMG, and it really seemed like a very obvious conflict of interest.
[2123.18 → 2123.62] Duh.
[2124.32 → 2126.22] So, anyway.
[2126.82 → 2129.96] Take this from people who are sitting where we're sitting.
[2130.16 → 2134.14] I have no ownership stake of any tech company.
[2134.40 → 2136.20] Actually, I don't think I own any stocks at all right now.
[2136.76 → 2136.94] Yeah.
[2137.08 → 2137.32] Zero.
[2137.52 → 2138.16] Zero stocks.
[2138.88 → 2140.12] And then do you own any?
[2140.36 → 2140.62] No.
[2140.76 → 2140.92] No.
[2140.92 → 2141.28] Okay.
[2142.10 → 2144.34] What tech stocks would you buy?
[2146.04 → 2146.32] Hmm.
[2147.42 → 2148.02] And remember.
[2148.36 → 2148.66] Okay.
[2148.74 → 2152.70] We're not going to be experts when it comes to, you know, the what is it?
[2152.74 → 2154.52] The dead cat bounce or, like, whatever.
[2154.78 → 2158.04] You know, like, like all that stocky.
[2158.34 → 2158.78] Yeah.
[2158.92 → 2159.76] Investment-y stuff.
[2159.92 → 2160.70] I'm just talking.
[2160.80 → 2162.00] As non-investment people.
[2162.36 → 2165.84] Over the next three to five years, who do you expect to just kill it?
[2166.52 → 2174.98] In terms of the actual tech, which theoretically at some point, although I can't quite find the correlation sometimes, theoretically at some point should affect the stock price.
[2175.56 → 2175.96] Yeah.
[2176.40 → 2176.84] I see.
[2177.08 → 2177.28] Okay.
[2177.32 → 2180.90] That's actually one thing I was going to bring up is, like, I don't know what current speculation is.
[2181.40 → 2182.60] So, things could be inflated.
[2183.04 → 2184.22] I don't know if they are or not.
[2184.52 → 2190.12] But, like, if we completely ignore all of that, I genuinely do think AMD would be a good position.
[2190.12 → 2190.78] You think so?
[2190.98 → 2191.12] Yeah.
[2191.20 → 2191.90] Like, long AMD.
[2192.34 → 2192.54] Yes.
[2192.54 → 2193.76] Short AMD is scary.
[2193.88 → 2195.32] Because they're, like, all over the place right now.
[2195.34 → 2195.36] Yeah.
[2195.36 → 2195.54] Yeah.
[2195.62 → 2196.18] Long AMD.
[2196.42 → 2198.96] Like, just to be clear, I track it just because I'm curious, but.
[2199.22 → 2202.82] Their platform for CPUs right now is really strong.
[2203.40 → 2212.10] And as we can see, whether this rumour is true or not, the fact that it's, like, that could be possible has a lot of potential in it.
[2212.18 → 2213.86] And Intel's in a terrible spot.
[2214.32 → 2215.38] They're kind of locked.
[2215.38 → 2216.38] Intel looks good on paper.
[2216.38 → 2216.94] Yeah.
[2216.94 → 2222.32] Intel looks good on paper because their revenue is great.
[2222.56 → 2222.76] Yeah.
[2222.76 → 2226.82] Their forecasting might look pretty darn good.
[2226.82 → 2230.06] But the problem is that, and we talked about this a lot.
[2230.06 → 2251.08] Back when we talked about AMD launching their 32 core EPIC processors, the long lead time on enterprise, where from the inception of a project like a supercomputer to the actual putting of CPUs into sockets could be a year, 18 months, two years.
[2251.08 → 2259.62] Like, in some cases, you end up actually building a custom facility for the damn thing before you even actually cut a PO for any computer hardware.
[2259.80 → 2263.10] Like, that's the kind of scale these projects operate on.
[2263.56 → 2271.64] So, Intel's revenues might look perfect because they have contracts locked in from before AMD was even remotely competitive.
[2271.64 → 2274.94] But that situation can change.
[2275.10 → 2285.98] And if AMD can stay very competitive and or even be a leader in certain aspects of that space, we're going to start to see it soon.
[2286.32 → 2286.42] Yeah.
[2287.04 → 2292.92] And, like, okay, I don't want any of this to be interpreted as actually advising anyone to do anything.
[2293.10 → 2293.72] Please, no.
[2293.74 → 2297.50] As far as I'm concerned, investing in stocks is gambling.
[2297.68 → 2297.88] Yeah.
[2297.88 → 2305.76] You might as well put, you know, 10,000 on black and spin the wheel as far as I'm concerned because there are so many factors.
[2306.00 → 2306.78] Like, you could—
[2306.78 → 2308.32] I think there's definitely more to it than that, but, like, yeah.
[2308.40 → 2310.08] You could have—well, yes and no.
[2310.66 → 2314.46] Because look at what happened to hard drives back in, what was it, 2011?
[2315.54 → 2315.80] Yeah.
[2315.80 → 2318.58] When there was the flooding in Thailand, right?
[2318.72 → 2318.92] Yeah.
[2319.10 → 2319.92] Thailand flooding.
[2320.82 → 2322.80] It completely destroyed their revenue.
[2323.26 → 2324.94] And then, this is the crazy thing.
[2324.94 → 2326.16] So, it destroyed their revenue.
[2326.28 → 2327.18] Everyone dumped them.
[2327.18 → 2331.48] And then, their profit margins went way up because supply was constrained.
[2331.70 → 2332.70] And they were a hot item.
[2332.92 → 2333.10] Yeah.
[2333.36 → 2335.60] It was like, yo, you understand that, like—
[2335.60 → 2336.16] How does this even work?
[2336.36 → 2337.80] What is even going on?
[2337.84 → 2340.22] Like, the business fundamentals never really changed here.
[2340.86 → 2343.30] I just think, like, instead of a—what is it?
[2343.36 → 2350.22] Like, 48.5 or something percentage chance if you go on black or red, I think you can try to push that percentage a little bit.
[2350.26 → 2352.72] Yeah, but you can also push that percentage at the blackjack table.
[2352.84 → 2353.26] That's true.
[2353.32 → 2354.64] Like, you don't have to play roulette.
[2354.64 → 2355.12] But—
[2355.12 → 2357.84] You did use roulette as an example.
[2357.86 → 2358.50] That's true.
[2359.40 → 2360.30] I'm just saying.
[2361.86 → 2363.82] Because, like, war could break out.
[2364.56 → 2365.02] And it's a funny—
[2365.02 → 2368.34] And that will rapidly—and that's actually, like, a scary possibility.
[2368.52 → 2374.28] Like, it's a funny thing to talk about because in our lifetimes, our generation, there have been wars.
[2374.28 → 2380.64] There was the war in Afghanistan, but if we're being honest with ourselves—
[2380.64 → 2382.06] No global scale conflicts.
[2382.26 → 2386.52] That was not a war compared to the Second World War.
[2386.68 → 2386.80] Yeah.
[2386.80 → 2394.98] Like, the previous generation saw war to the degree that the entire country is mobilized.
[2395.08 → 2403.96] You know, people who aren't working are kind of being rounded up to produce bullets in impromptu factories so that the soldiers overseas will have enough bullets.
[2404.20 → 2406.14] Like, it's different.
[2406.28 → 2406.84] It's very different.
[2406.84 → 2413.52] And when that happens, there are some companies that can flourish, and there are other companies that will absolutely not.
[2413.94 → 2415.82] Tech companies might actually even do okay.
[2416.30 → 2418.88] I wouldn't think consumer tech companies would do okay.
[2419.10 → 2421.64] But certain enterprise tech companies might do completely fine.
[2421.64 → 2430.50] So, we're just trying to say that no matter what it is, no matter how sure the outlook is, anything could happen.
[2430.74 → 2432.34] So, it really is a gamble.
[2433.10 → 2434.44] I'm the only one that answered, though.
[2434.52 → 2435.14] What about you?
[2436.58 → 2441.80] I have a few other, like, maybe interesting idea ones, but I want to hear from you.
[2442.42 → 2444.80] This isn't something I've thought about, so I really—I don't know.
[2444.98 → 2448.42] I actually think Amazon is far from capped out, personally.
[2448.60 → 2449.00] Yeah, for sure.
[2449.00 → 2463.38] I always have a problem with including them in this type of stack, because you're talking—I thought we were talking about, like, tech companies where, yeah, no, they make echoes and stuff.
[2463.40 → 2463.68] No, yeah.
[2463.88 → 2464.54] Yeah, no, you're totally right.
[2464.54 → 2465.22] They're even a hardware company.
[2465.22 → 2465.74] All right, yeah.
[2465.92 → 2470.48] I think they have plenty of room to continue to innovate and continue to take over the world.
[2470.62 → 2473.78] Like, if there's anyone who's going to be the buy-in-large from Wall-E, it's going to be Amazon at this point.
[2473.78 → 2474.50] Oh, absolutely.
[2474.50 → 2474.66] Absolutely.
[2475.06 → 2479.14] Have you seen their, like, the revenue stack of Amazon versus all these other retail companies?
[2479.30 → 2479.54] No.
[2479.70 → 2480.98] It's insane.
[2481.56 → 2489.96] I don't know where that picture's from, but, like, it includes so many physical retailers that are, like, huge names that are just a tiny fraction of the revenue that Amazon's pulling.
[2490.54 → 2491.96] Like, it's absolutely wild.
[2491.98 → 2492.04] It's madness.
[2492.82 → 2494.96] Yeah, I don't think there's an insight for them either.
[2494.96 → 2499.40] I think there's plenty of room for them, especially because they've already gone global.
[2499.62 → 2504.06] They've got, they're opening up India, and they are sophisticated.
[2505.10 → 2507.34] So, yeah, Amazon.
[2507.54 → 2517.44] I wanted to put, like, a quarter of my net worth on Amazon, like, five years ago, which, like, it wasn't, you know, like, a huge amount of money or anything, but it was, like, a big bet for me.
[2517.64 → 2518.06] Well, yeah.
[2518.06 → 2521.94] That was around the time that, instead, we founded Linus Media Group.
[2523.10 → 2524.52] So, you know what?
[2524.58 → 2526.76] Linus Media Group has been, worked out great.
[2527.18 → 2529.74] But Amazon also wouldn't have been a bad bet.
[2531.74 → 2533.18] So, yeah, I...
[2533.18 → 2535.18] I tried to get, I sent a...
[2535.18 → 2535.34] Yeah.
[2535.68 → 2536.48] Was it a letter?
[2537.12 → 2537.42] I don't know.
[2537.42 → 2538.48] This was a long time ago.
[2538.92 → 2540.04] Pre-Halo 1.
[2540.56 → 2540.80] Yeah.
[2540.80 → 2546.88] I tried to, the only person I knew that had any form of money was my grandpa.
[2546.88 → 2552.32] So, I, like, wrote a thing and gave it to my grandpa, trying to get my grandpa to invest in Bungee.
[2553.32 → 2554.42] Pre-Halo 1.
[2555.52 → 2559.54] Before the game was out, I was like, this is going to be insane.
[2559.94 → 2560.76] And I'm a kid.
[2561.00 → 2561.90] I have no money.
[2562.20 → 2563.06] I can't do it.
[2563.20 → 2565.36] But I'm like, someone needs to do this.
[2565.82 → 2567.26] And, uh, that was a no.
[2568.54 → 2571.14] So, there was no Bungee investment at that time.
[2571.36 → 2572.46] I don't even know if they were a...
[2572.46 → 2573.70] I didn't know anything back then.
[2573.74 → 2575.30] I don't know if they were a publicly tradable company.
[2575.30 → 2577.76] Like, I have no clue if that was even possible.
[2578.18 → 2581.58] I was just like, I think my grandpa was just like, okay.
[2582.58 → 2583.32] Okay, my boy.
[2585.08 → 2586.84] Do we have to talk about this?
[2587.68 → 2589.00] I mean, wait, what?
[2589.12 → 2589.46] Which one?
[2590.00 → 2590.26] Oh.
[2590.66 → 2591.06] Uh.
[2591.58 → 2593.64] So, TF2 used to be fun.
[2594.34 → 2595.50] TF2 was so much fun.
[2596.16 → 2598.98] And then they made it free to play and there were hats everywhere.
[2598.98 → 2602.10] That was legitimately when I stopped playing.
[2602.82 → 2605.22] TF2 used to actually be really fun.
[2605.30 → 2610.20] The problem with free to play is that there's no real...
[2610.20 → 2615.20] There's no real venom in the VAC ban fangs.
[2615.92 → 2616.14] Yeah.
[2616.46 → 2619.26] Because you can just use...
[2619.26 → 2620.58] Do they still call them smurf accounts?
[2621.46 → 2621.94] Yeah.
[2621.94 → 2622.42] Okay.
[2622.58 → 2626.76] So, you can just use smurf accounts, and you can create as many accounts as you want.
[2627.20 → 2628.82] And the ban just means nothing.
[2629.14 → 2631.04] IP is so easy to get around these days.
[2631.50 → 2632.48] Very easy.
[2632.94 → 2634.54] Get a PIA subscription.
[2634.90 → 2635.82] Support the channel.
[2636.66 → 2638.58] I don't want to be like that.
[2639.08 → 2645.32] But it's kind of a different community in games where it's people who can afford to pay 20 bucks.
[2646.08 → 2648.58] So, one thing that I'm going to throw in here is Prime status.
[2649.22 → 2650.70] So, you were asking about this early on.
[2650.98 → 2655.96] If you bought Counter-Strike before it went free to play, you have Prime status.
[2656.24 → 2660.46] And if you pay the equivalent of buying the game, you can buy Prime status.
[2660.64 → 2660.92] Forever?
[2661.26 → 2661.66] Forever.
[2662.30 → 2663.58] It's a one-time purchase.
[2664.58 → 2669.38] And you can filter matches so that you only play against Prime-enabled people.
[2670.90 → 2671.34] Oh.
[2673.28 → 2673.90] Oh, okay.
[2673.90 → 2674.22] Okay.
[2674.22 → 2675.44] So, like, my account...
[2675.44 → 2676.40] Okay, I actually didn't know that.
[2676.48 → 2678.60] ...only plays against Prime-enabled accounts.
[2679.64 → 2681.86] So, Prime status matches you with Prime status players.
[2681.86 → 2686.76] And if I remember correctly, for Prime, you have to put your phone number in.
[2687.58 → 2690.02] So, like, if your Prime account gets banned, your phone number gets banned.
[2690.24 → 2690.46] Okay.
[2690.48 → 2691.66] And, like, there's some other...
[2691.66 → 2694.82] I think you have to play a minimum amount before you can actually matchmaker at that,
[2694.88 → 2696.22] even if you buy a Prime account.
[2696.52 → 2697.02] Like, there's...
[2697.02 → 2698.06] I don't remember all of it.
[2698.10 → 2698.46] I'm sorry.
[2698.58 → 2700.92] But there are additional requirements as well.
[2700.92 → 2701.66] Like, yeah.
[2701.80 → 2703.30] Prime matchmaking is pretty cool.
[2703.30 → 2706.72] There are still plenty of hackers on Prime matchmaking.
[2707.12 → 2708.46] Wingman, before they...
[2708.46 → 2711.10] Most people in the Counter-Strike community don't even know what Wingman is.
[2711.22 → 2715.84] But Wingman, before they enabled replays, and before they enabled...
[2716.40 → 2719.18] What is it called?
[2720.12 → 2722.84] The like, was this person cheating...
[2722.84 → 2724.64] Watcher thing.
[2724.70 → 2725.48] I don't remember what that's called.
[2725.56 → 2725.88] But whatever.
[2725.88 → 2730.26] Before they enabled either of those things was just a hive of villainies in terms of hacking.
[2730.64 → 2732.94] And when they enabled those things, it was insane.
[2733.10 → 2735.46] The amount of people that got banned the next day.
[2735.58 → 2740.08] Because there was all these replays of people cheating in this special mode that didn't have replays.
[2740.44 → 2742.00] So then just waves of bans.
[2742.10 → 2743.04] It was glorious.
[2743.20 → 2744.70] Because I liked to play that mode.
[2745.00 → 2745.30] But yeah.
[2745.44 → 2745.74] It's okay.
[2745.74 → 2751.88] So in addition to it going free to play and the Prime status thing, there's also a Battle Royale mode.
[2752.22 → 2754.02] One interesting thing about this Battle Royale mode...
[2754.02 → 2756.08] Is there like a build that got passed that I'm not aware of?
[2756.20 → 2757.04] You have to.
[2757.16 → 2757.86] You have to.
[2757.86 → 2758.44] You have to Battle Royale.
[2758.54 → 2760.06] So there's going to be Data Battle Royale.
[2760.06 → 2760.50] Like...
[2760.50 → 2763.48] Well, that would actually be kind of cool.
[2763.66 → 2764.24] Is that a thing already?
[2764.52 → 2767.94] Data Battle Royale.
[2769.54 → 2771.42] New Data 2 has a Battle Royale mode.
[2771.42 → 2771.62] Yeah.
[2771.74 → 2772.22] I was like...
[2772.22 → 2772.70] I'm pretty sure...
[2772.70 → 2773.20] What was this?
[2773.50 → 2774.62] Oh, I already closed it.
[2774.70 → 2775.26] That's fine.
[2775.32 → 2775.68] I'm over it.
[2775.68 → 2775.86] Okay.
[2776.00 → 2777.08] So...
[2777.08 → 2778.36] Danger Zone.
[2779.08 → 2781.10] Most Battle Royals, they're like 100 people, right?
[2781.26 → 2781.50] Mm-hmm.
[2781.84 → 2782.60] This is 16.
[2783.10 → 2784.12] That's not really Royal.
[2784.64 → 2785.38] It's much smaller.
[2785.38 → 2786.20] It's like less than Battlefield.
[2786.20 → 2788.02] The map is really, really tiny.
[2788.02 → 2790.60] Like it says in here, the matches last about 10 minutes each.
[2790.68 → 2791.28] That makes sense.
[2792.02 → 2795.74] You can play in solo, duo, or trios.
[2795.86 → 2796.66] There's no quad.
[2797.26 → 2799.90] There's no squad or quad or whatever you want to call it.
[2801.04 → 2801.48] Squad.
[2802.04 → 2802.48] Yeah.
[2802.62 → 2802.78] Yeah.
[2803.28 → 2803.58] All right.
[2804.26 → 2808.02] You pick up guns and equipment and armour and flash bangs.
[2808.18 → 2811.42] And there is a self-heal thing, which Counter-Strike hasn't had before.
[2811.46 → 2813.10] But there is a self-heal thing, which makes sense.
[2813.50 → 2815.10] But you also pick up cash.
[2815.74 → 2817.94] Because Counter-Strike has always had the buying mechanics, right?
[2818.02 → 2819.32] So you can buy stuff.
[2819.62 → 2821.22] But a drone will deliver it to you.
[2822.50 → 2822.82] Okay.
[2822.90 → 2823.42] That's interesting.
[2823.52 → 2825.22] You have a tablet thing, so you can see the map.
[2825.28 → 2826.52] And you can see the drone coming to you.
[2826.60 → 2828.10] But everyone else can see the drone.
[2828.92 → 2830.36] And it drops it on you.
[2830.56 → 2833.02] And like if you move a little bit, it'll go to where you are.
[2833.30 → 2833.66] Interesting.
[2833.80 → 2835.42] So people can hunt the drones down.
[2835.68 → 2839.70] And this is actually a really, if you haven't played before, do this and get tons of free kills.
[2840.08 → 2840.52] Trust me.
[2840.96 → 2841.94] You hunt the drone down.
[2842.02 → 2842.92] You follow the drone.
[2842.92 → 2844.82] And then you go to where it's dropping it.
[2844.84 → 2845.56] You sit a little bit away.
[2845.62 → 2846.36] You wait for it to drop.
[2846.52 → 2848.04] And then you just aim where it's dropping.
[2848.20 → 2849.82] And some dude's going to run up and try to get it.
[2849.90 → 2850.48] You just shoot him.
[2851.22 → 2851.98] It's amazing.
[2852.26 → 2853.80] There's free kills all the time.
[2854.20 → 2855.94] It's, yeah, it's interesting.
[2856.36 → 2858.72] It's one thing that I like about it is the 10-minute matches.
[2858.86 → 2860.44] Even if you win, it's like a 10-minute match.
[2860.80 → 2861.12] Okay.
[2861.32 → 2861.90] It's a lot faster.
[2862.64 → 2863.56] That's one improvement.
[2863.82 → 2866.04] Like, Battle Royale, I had a lot of fun playing PUBG.
[2866.22 → 2867.08] Not Fortnite so much.
[2867.12 → 2868.46] But I had a lot of fun playing PUBG.
[2868.72 → 2870.88] Like, the handful of times I was able to do it.
[2871.04 → 2871.20] Yeah.
[2871.32 → 2872.04] But it was just.
[2872.54 → 2873.08] It's really long.
[2873.14 → 2881.06] Unless you could commit, like, three hours to a gaming session, you're not really going to get into your groove even necessarily.
[2881.06 → 2881.30] No.
[2881.68 → 2884.22] We won our first and third game, I think it was.
[2884.34 → 2886.16] So those matches are really long.
[2886.84 → 2888.56] Like, they're actually going for a very long time.
[2888.56 → 2893.30] And that's been a problem with competitive games for a long time is that their matches last forever.
[2893.42 → 2895.52] A competitive Counter-Strike match lasts a very long time.
[2895.82 → 2897.82] Competitive League of Legends match, very long time.
[2897.90 → 2899.04] Data 2, very long time.
[2899.32 → 2900.86] Lots of these games are really, really long.
[2900.94 → 2903.02] So having 10-minute matches is actually very cool.
[2904.20 → 2908.52] And, like, when you die or when you win, there's a play again button sitting right there.
[2908.86 → 2909.20] Click it.
[2909.32 → 2910.44] You get right back into another game.
[2910.56 → 2911.30] It's really fast.
[2911.52 → 2911.70] Cool.
[2911.86 → 2912.06] Okay.
[2912.36 → 2912.58] Yeah.
[2914.02 → 2914.90] OnePlus's CEO.
[2915.20 → 2917.48] This was posted by Dr. McIntosh on the forum.
[2917.48 → 2922.40] Oh, the previous one was Princess Cadence and the previous one was Deus of Voltage.
[2923.70 → 2928.32] OnePlus's CEO tells the truth about 5G.
[2928.72 → 2935.74] The original article here is from The Verge, and it's from an interview with Pete Lau about Qualcomm Snapdragon 855.
[2936.70 → 2939.90] Or no, sorry, it's at the Snapdragon Tech Summit in Maui.
[2939.90 → 2946.72] So he said his company is working on both a new 5G OnePlus phone and 4G phones in parallel.
[2947.84 → 2951.96] He expects the 5G phone will cost as much as $200 to $300 more.
[2952.70 → 2954.12] Wrap your head around that.
[2954.70 → 2955.62] Holy cow.
[2955.94 → 2961.04] So 5G is coming, but it is not necessarily going to be mainstream.
[2961.04 → 2963.46] That is one hell of a premium.
[2963.74 → 2965.42] That's like a G-Sync addition to your phone.
[2965.96 → 2969.78] So this might not be the case for all new 5G smartphones.
[2971.28 → 2975.12] Some might try to monetize their existing customer base as much as they can.
[2975.30 → 2977.60] Just saying, well, you know, people will pay for it.
[2977.66 → 2980.08] So we're going to price it at whatever we can.
[2980.08 → 2985.22] While others might try to gain market share by offering 5G connectivity at a cutthroat price.
[2986.28 → 2992.58] One of the challenges is going to be building 5G phones for multiple carriers that operate on different frequencies.
[2993.94 → 2997.04] So Lau expects that it will be even more difficult.
[2997.14 → 3007.72] Now this has gotten easier over time as the antennas that have been integrated into our phones have gotten broader and broader support for 4G LTE frequencies.
[3007.72 → 3015.72] But now he expects it's going to be even more difficult to take a phone from one carrier to another with 5G than it was for 4G.
[3017.20 → 3017.72] Interesting.
[3018.40 → 3022.10] They haven't seen a solution that would cover many carriers around the world.
[3023.14 → 3023.48] Huh.
[3026.06 → 3027.70] Well, that's pretty scary.
[3028.14 → 3028.94] That is kind of scary.
[3029.68 → 3031.52] As if phones weren't expensive enough already.
[3032.88 → 3036.46] So OnePlus's 5G phone is targeting just one type of 5G network.
[3036.46 → 3041.92] The slower speeds but wider coverage area sub-6 spectrum used by EE.
[3042.38 → 3043.72] It's first carrier partner in Europe.
[3044.42 → 3051.40] In the U.S., AT&T and Verizon are both focusing on the faster but lower range millimetre wave.
[3053.54 → 3057.26] And apparently on the product level, it's much more complex than 4G.
[3057.46 → 3060.48] Like a significantly higher level of challenge, especially millimetre wave.
[3061.88 → 3062.32] Huh.
[3062.32 → 3065.96] It's going to be interested in places like the U.S.
[3067.16 → 3070.48] Where, like, I mean, Canada has this problem too, but I literally think it's worse in the U.S.
[3070.66 → 3072.60] The coverage areas are already terrible.
[3075.72 → 3076.54] Wow, that's rough.
[3076.64 → 3081.36] Maybe you like shorter distance, less penetration through walls signals.
[3081.36 → 3082.98] So this is interesting.
[3083.60 → 3091.34] Walmart has apparently dropped the pricing of their overpowered gaming PCs, I guess, to just get rid of them.
[3091.76 → 3100.88] And then, I don't know, I guess to just get rid of them and either refresh them with better motherboards or just get rid of them outright.
[3100.88 → 3100.96] Right.
[3102.66 → 3103.02] Fascinating.
[3103.32 → 3111.82] It's too bad because I actually think that there was potential for them to, like, there were processes that seemed to be fine across the board.
[3113.08 → 3118.04] I was surprised how many people were really upset about the USB 3 port being hot glued in.
[3118.82 → 3119.56] Oh, yeah.
[3119.62 → 3122.32] I mean, that just didn't make any sense to me, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
[3122.60 → 3122.82] Yeah.
[3123.34 → 3125.92] But, like, people thought it was just a horrendous thing.
[3126.04 → 3126.16] Really?
[3127.12 → 3129.44] Stuff gets hot glued into pre-built PCs all the time.
[3130.18 → 3131.46] Like, that's actually quite common.
[3131.52 → 3132.52] Like, things jostle around in shipment.
[3132.70 → 3136.48] Yeah, and hot glue, especially, because you've got to remember, too, I actually didn't test it.
[3136.50 → 3137.28] I should have tested it.
[3137.28 → 3137.88] I should have pulled it out.
[3138.20 → 3139.72] There are lots of different kinds of hot glue.
[3139.72 → 3143.10] Some of them are actually designed to be quite easy to peel off.
[3143.22 → 3145.30] There are lots of electronics that have hot glue on them.
[3145.32 → 3145.42] Yeah.
[3146.90 → 3152.36] No, I thought you were going to say you were surprised people were so upset about the USB 2 on the front.
[3152.82 → 3154.86] And I was going to say, no, I was pretty upset about that.
[3154.90 → 3156.04] The front ports were USB 2.
[3156.12 → 3156.80] Come on, what year is it?
[3157.00 → 3158.38] Literally didn't even know what you were talking about.
[3158.48 → 3159.46] That sounds really stupid.
[3161.94 → 3162.78] Very, very stupid.
[3162.92 → 3166.38] Especially with the amount of USB 3 front headers you can get now.
[3167.54 → 3169.82] Like, you can actually put a lot up there pretty easily.
[3170.84 → 3172.42] Was the CPU hot glued in, too?
[3172.56 → 3172.86] No.
[3173.50 → 3173.72] No.
[3173.96 → 3174.18] No.
[3174.32 → 3175.30] They got that part right.
[3176.02 → 3176.62] All right.
[3176.82 → 3180.90] Bringing us to the end of the show with the Super Chats.
[3181.22 → 3181.50] Yeah.
[3182.82 → 3184.80] All right.
[3185.02 → 3187.34] Do an LTT beanie for real, says Andrew.
[3188.02 → 3189.66] There will be lots more merch stuff.
[3190.14 → 3190.80] Stay tuned.
[3192.58 → 3193.66] Yeah, stay tuned.
[3193.92 → 3195.06] Liam says, will this work?
[3195.46 → 3196.22] It worked, Liam.
[3198.42 → 3199.80] Mesh says, what even?
[3200.54 → 3202.04] What are these Super Chats?
[3202.60 → 3207.26] Well, sometimes people don't, like, they say something within the context of what's happening at that exact second.
[3207.26 → 3210.26] On the internet, no one knows you're a puppy.
[3210.64 → 3212.56] That didn't make sense at any point in this stream.
[3212.64 → 3212.76] Nope.
[3212.82 → 3214.38] His name is Pup Shepherd, though.
[3214.82 → 3216.86] Daniel says, when did you start growing a beard, Luke?
[3216.94 → 3218.72] Was it when your razor got too dull?
[3218.72 → 3223.58] I don't want to talk about it.
[3223.98 → 3227.76] But I am looking for a barber, because I'm going to try to have it shaped.
[3228.02 → 3228.32] Okay.
[3228.44 → 3228.80] Got it.
[3228.88 → 3230.78] I want to keep it going, but it's a mess.
[3231.04 → 3232.32] So I just want it to be not a mess.
[3232.52 → 3237.98] Dennis asks, Linus, is the 4790K still a good CPU, or is it worthwhile to upgrade?
[3238.44 → 3240.52] And if you were to upgrade, would you choose Ry zen or Intel?
[3240.64 → 3241.46] I mostly game.
[3242.46 → 3243.62] I would hold on to it.
[3243.62 → 3245.36] Oh, but I need more cores for other stuff.
[3245.36 → 3245.80] Okay.
[3247.52 → 3248.50] What other stuff?
[3248.78 → 3250.24] Yeah, that would be helpful to know.
[3250.44 → 3252.34] If it's just for gaming, no, I would stick with that.
[3252.40 → 3253.50] Maybe overclock it a little bit.
[3253.86 → 3258.06] If you need to do other stuff, it depends on what the other stuff is and how much of it you do.
[3258.12 → 3261.08] If you do a lot of other stuff, and it needs a lot more cores, I'd go Ry zen.
[3261.16 → 3263.80] If not, then I'd probably go 8600K or something like that.
[3263.82 → 3264.34] Post on the form.
[3265.02 → 3265.26] Yeah.
[3268.36 → 3271.90] SAME says, I just bought X470 and Ry zen 7 2700X.
[3272.00 → 3272.52] So sad.
[3272.56 → 3273.10] No, don't be sad.
[3273.20 → 3273.90] It's a good combo.
[3273.90 → 3274.52] It should be all right.
[3275.36 → 3281.72] Mr. Kenwood says, subscribe to PewDiePie.
[3285.18 → 3286.48] Dave says, love LTT.
[3286.70 → 3290.38] Wanted to make another plea for a retro gaming video team up with retro RGB.
[3291.54 → 3293.50] I don't know exactly what we do.
[3293.58 → 3294.02] You know, it's funny.
[3294.64 → 3298.28] We get like collab requests from other creators sometimes.
[3298.76 → 3302.22] And I got one quite recently that's like, I'm like, yeah, sure.
[3302.30 → 3303.24] That would be kind of neat.
[3303.24 → 3304.70] But like, what do we do?
[3305.04 → 3306.24] What would we do?
[3306.32 → 3311.32] I don't like collabing just for the sake of cross-pollinating.
[3311.48 → 3312.02] It feels.
[3313.02 → 3313.30] Icky.
[3313.74 → 3314.04] Yeah.
[3314.28 → 3314.92] Cross pollinating.
[3315.48 → 3315.82] Yeah.
[3315.82 → 3319.92] I just, I just, I just don't care.
[3319.92 → 3324.36] Um, Marshal Long sent $69.
[3324.90 → 3325.46] Of course he did.
[3326.28 → 3329.14] Thoughts on Intel missing the 10 nanometre node.
[3331.14 → 3331.66] Oh.
[3331.66 → 3339.84] So for one thing, I do want to point out, they didn't entirely miss it.
[3340.12 → 3343.44] They do actually, they are actually shipping 10 nanometre products right now.
[3343.94 → 3344.98] A lot of people don't know this.
[3345.08 → 3347.52] They have nooks that do have 10.
[3347.56 → 3348.14] Did you know this?
[3348.54 → 3350.32] They have 10 nanometre processors in them.
[3351.60 → 3352.48] Um, yeah.
[3352.74 → 3352.98] Yeah.
[3352.98 → 3357.86] So, so they didn't, they didn't miss it altogether, but it's sort of in the same way that they
[3357.86 → 3359.52] didn't entirely miss Bradwell.
[3360.22 → 3360.62] Yeah.
[3361.48 → 3363.36] Like Bradwell consumer, to be clear.
[3363.44 → 3365.54] Bradwell did make it to HEAT and enterprise.
[3366.08 → 3367.36] Um, but yes, they did.
[3367.44 → 3372.18] They did miss Bradwell and they, they do appear to have missed 10 nanometers because from what
[3372.18 → 3376.00] I've been seeing, the rumour is they're kind of trying to go straight to seven now.
[3376.08 → 3376.84] Have you seen this as well?
[3377.02 → 3377.22] Yes.
[3377.48 → 3380.06] Um, I think we've known, haven't we known that for a bit?
[3381.22 → 3387.96] So the thing about Intel is a lot of people like to talk about Intel as though Intel is
[3387.96 → 3396.02] a person with a singular desire and a singular work ethic and a singular, um, sort of moral
[3396.02 → 3398.64] compass as though, as though it was that simple.
[3398.76 → 3400.50] Intel is a lot of people.
[3400.84 → 3401.18] A giant company.
[3401.18 → 3404.58] There are a gigantic company, something like a hundred thousand employees.
[3404.90 → 3408.18] And they even just physical displacement of those employees is very notable.
[3409.02 → 3418.68] On the one hand, this is a pretty big black mark on what is otherwise an astonishing record
[3418.68 → 3421.54] of technological innovation over the years.
[3422.42 → 3430.56] Uh, on the other hand, to me, it's less about Intel missing 10 nanometers and more about
[3430.56 → 3436.88] Intel missing 10 nanometers being indicative of where the technology industry is going over
[3436.88 → 3437.92] the next 10 years.
[3438.12 → 3445.74] We have taken for granted that things will just get faster and smaller with better battery
[3445.74 → 3446.08] life.
[3446.08 → 3451.66] We just assume that every year there will be a new iPhone that is better than the old
[3451.66 → 3453.10] one in some meaningful way.
[3453.10 → 3453.42] Yeah.
[3454.42 → 3456.78] That may actually stop.
[3457.50 → 3460.44] And it's funny because I remember standing.
[3460.76 → 3461.76] It was really weird.
[3461.82 → 3464.42] It was kind of like, it was kind of like a Jesus speech.
[3465.06 → 3472.26] Um, because, uh, Raja Kauri had just come back to AMD and I kind of feel like they did it
[3472.26 → 3472.76] on purpose.
[3472.76 → 3477.10] Like he was supposed to be kind of like the Messiah to bring their graphics business back
[3477.10 → 3477.82] from the brink.
[3478.52 → 3480.78] Meanwhile, he's gone now, but anyway, that's a whole other thing.
[3480.94 → 3484.94] So he's standing, we're in Hawaii, and he's standing at the top of this kind of hill and
[3484.94 → 3487.90] we're all kind of spread out in front of him at the bottom of the hill.
[3488.00 → 3491.56] No, it really was kind of like, we had just kind of hiked up to this thing.
[3491.64 → 3492.10] It was, it was cool.
[3492.18 → 3493.04] There were like runes and stuff.
[3493.10 → 3493.30] Anyway.
[3493.92 → 3495.72] Um, there were runes and stuff.
[3496.12 → 3496.48] Ruins.
[3496.66 → 3496.98] Ruins.
[3497.04 → 3497.18] Yeah.
[3497.22 → 3498.08] Not those kinds of ruins.
[3498.32 → 3500.04] I was like, this is getting pretty crazy.
[3500.04 → 3510.78] Um, and he kind of stands up there and declares AMD's graphics business to be a software business.
[3511.56 → 3515.10] And remember this was, was he wrong?
[3515.56 → 3519.10] How programmable have GPUs become in that time?
[3519.28 → 3519.40] Yeah.
[3520.98 → 3529.04] And that's effectively what that's, that's one piece of this, of the puzzle of the direction
[3529.04 → 3536.32] that we are moving overall and Intel missing a node and your applications getting faster
[3536.32 → 3542.84] and your graphics in your games getting better anyway is sort of an indication of what is
[3542.84 → 3543.30] to come.
[3543.92 → 3551.74] Software tomfoolery, like with VR, the way that they will inject extra frames to accommodate
[3551.74 → 3556.02] that graphics cards haven't gotten a lot faster or more, certainly not more affordable.
[3556.98 → 3560.50] Software tomfoolery may just be the way it's going to have to be.
[3560.78 → 3561.16] Go ahead.
[3561.18 → 3564.94] I think it might be the way it's going to have to be for a little while, and then we will
[3564.94 → 3566.64] change how we're doing things.
[3567.28 → 3570.50] Like, I mean, risk five could come along and really change the game.
[3570.64 → 3570.86] Yeah.
[3570.94 → 3574.74] Like, like there, there could be completely different architecture styles.
[3575.38 → 3576.90] But that's going to take time.
[3577.02 → 3577.36] Yes.
[3577.36 → 3577.80] Okay.
[3577.80 → 3583.74] I will agree with your stance probably for like a little while, but I think I could see
[3583.74 → 3584.48] it doing that.
[3584.60 → 3584.94] Five years?
[3584.94 → 3585.24] For sure.
[3585.52 → 3586.22] Yeah, I could see that.
[3587.04 → 3592.06] But I think eventually we're going to change how we do things, and then we'll see advancement
[3592.06 → 3596.78] again in, in, in hard way or whatever it is at that time.
[3596.86 → 3598.08] Because like the challenge here.
[3598.08 → 3598.28] Organics even.
[3598.92 → 3599.68] Is that if we could just.
[3599.68 → 3600.74] Organic computing is a really cool.
[3600.74 → 3605.28] If we could just keep pushing clock speed higher, it would be easier to compensate for
[3605.28 → 3609.74] some of the some of the trickery that has already made its way into the hardware products.
[3609.80 → 3611.60] I mean, you look at what happened with Spectre and Meltdown.
[3611.92 → 3612.14] Yeah.
[3612.46 → 3618.28] Anything that requires a branch prediction, for example, which dramatically accelerates the
[3618.28 → 3618.56] CPU.
[3618.70 → 3623.46] I mean, if you don't have good branch prediction in your CPU, your performance basically sucks
[3623.46 → 3624.32] these days.
[3624.32 → 3629.80] And now all of a sudden there are these exploits that are making it so that it's becoming more
[3629.80 → 3631.22] challenging to implement these features.
[3631.36 → 3635.72] I mean, SMT, there was a there was a group that came out and basically said hyper threading
[3635.72 → 3636.84] is insecure.
[3637.20 → 3639.10] We just like shouldn't use it anymore.
[3639.30 → 3640.44] Meanwhile, poor AMD.
[3640.88 → 3643.38] Oh man, we finally got it.
[3644.52 → 3646.12] We just added this.
[3650.62 → 3651.10] So.
[3651.10 → 3655.48] It's like, it's like everyone tells you about this party, and you show up, and you show up
[3655.48 → 3656.38] and everyone's leaving.
[3656.56 → 3657.22] It's like, oh.
[3658.16 → 3660.60] So thoughts on Intel missing the 10 nanometre node.
[3661.24 → 3665.28] I don't think that Intel, I don't think people are going to stop needing computing devices.
[3665.28 → 3669.86] And I think Intel is going to continue to be a player in that space, whether it's through
[3669.86 → 3673.90] innovating their own things or acquiring others or just marketing the heck out of themselves
[3673.90 → 3674.30] again.
[3674.30 → 3682.92] But the industry as a whole has gotten less exciting to me.
[3683.04 → 3683.26] Oh yeah.
[3683.26 → 3684.14] I'm not going to hide it.
[3684.26 → 3688.94] And I think that Intel is a symptom as opposed to the problem.
[3689.58 → 3691.16] I hope that answer is helpful.
[3691.16 → 3696.38] I can't read your username, but you said Fortnite is for children.
[3697.72 → 3698.08] Carboy.
[3698.58 → 3699.44] Please make a video.
[3699.56 → 3703.66] We saw this PC case in half and put it back together with the power of flex tape.
[3704.46 → 3704.86] No.
[3706.28 → 3706.68] Metric.
[3706.82 → 3707.18] Hi.
[3707.54 → 3707.90] Dax.
[3708.40 → 3708.80] Hi.
[3709.76 → 3710.16] Johnny.
[3710.88 → 3711.28] Hi.
[3711.68 → 3711.98] Wow.
[3712.06 → 3712.60] Henry boy.
[3713.38 → 3713.96] I need a new phone.
[3714.02 → 3714.78] Is the Vivo Next worth it?
[3714.80 → 3716.08] I wouldn't go Vivo Next personally.
[3716.18 → 3717.44] I would go with something with a better camera.
[3717.88 → 3719.78] Michel says, ordered your coffee.
[3720.16 → 3721.32] Should be here in a few days.
[3721.86 → 3725.96] You're going to be trying it the same time I am because I actually haven't tried it yet.
[3726.12 → 3726.42] Really?
[3726.52 → 3729.30] Well, I don't really drink coffee, as you know.
[3729.42 → 3729.68] Yeah.
[3729.98 → 3734.64] And I wasn't actually in office when they were doing all the testing of the different blends
[3734.64 → 3736.34] that they concocted for us and stuff.
[3736.68 → 3740.32] But we had just about a dozen people here try it and like it.
[3740.64 → 3740.78] Cool.
[3741.30 → 3742.58] What is the blend?
[3743.34 → 3743.84] Do we know?
[3744.40 → 3744.76] Can you say?
[3744.78 → 3745.64] Well, I haven't tried it.
[3745.70 → 3746.12] Oh, okay.
[3746.18 → 3746.50] That's fair.
[3746.50 → 3749.02] So, I'll be trying it around the same time as everyone else.
[3749.58 → 3751.66] And, by the way, don't pre-order.
[3751.94 → 3756.58] But also, I guess, think of it more like supporting LTT and less like pre-ordering.
[3757.56 → 3757.96] Modals.
[3758.14 → 3758.44] Hi.
[3758.64 → 3758.88] Cheers.
[3759.02 → 3759.72] Back to Norway.
[3760.54 → 3762.00] QWERTY asks, LTX After-party?
[3762.44 → 3762.84] Wow.
[3762.96 → 3763.58] No idea.
[3764.50 → 3765.84] Get back to you on that one.
[3765.94 → 3766.22] Cameron.
[3766.30 → 3766.86] LTX After-party.
[3766.88 → 3768.80] Time to fly up from Florida for this.
[3768.90 → 3769.80] That would be awesome.
[3770.56 → 3771.34] It's going to be awesome.
[3771.34 → 3775.82] I can't read your name because you're Russian, but what's the dream hack?
[3776.62 → 3777.16] Dang it.
[3777.38 → 3778.98] It's dream hack.
[3779.10 → 3780.00] Just Google dream hack.
[3780.00 → 3780.26] Yeah.
[3781.12 → 3783.72] Butt says, what exactly is going on at LTX?
[3784.22 → 3784.84] Lots of stuff.
[3784.96 → 3785.80] Stay tuned to Sancho.
[3785.86 → 3786.54] We're going to be talking about it.
[3786.54 → 3787.00] It's going to be great.
[3787.00 → 3795.14] Gives says, best phone for gaming, GPS, hot spotting, Bluetooth, and charging.
[3795.14 → 3798.80] Oh, and charging all at the same time in hot weather without overheating.
[3798.88 → 3800.72] I still play Pokémon Go.
[3801.28 → 3802.22] Oh, no.
[3803.48 → 3804.28] Hey, Jake.
[3804.56 → 3806.62] That fan module for the DOG phone.
[3806.74 → 3808.00] That made a pretty big difference, right?
[3808.32 → 3808.50] Yeah.
[3809.04 → 3809.40] Like what?
[3809.70 → 3810.18] Five degrees?
[3810.28 → 3810.60] Ten degrees?
[3810.70 → 3811.14] I don't know.
[3811.32 → 3813.48] I don't know exactly degrees, but it felt a lot better.
[3813.58 → 3813.96] I don't remember.
[3814.10 → 3814.76] It actually helped.
[3814.76 → 3820.38] And actually, OnePlus, we found when we were evaluating the Racer gaming phone, OnePlus
[3820.38 → 3824.28] does a great job of the management of their CPU's power states.
[3825.02 → 3827.34] So can't recommend those guys enough.
[3827.84 → 3830.10] Clemens says, will there be free Marina's coffee at LTX?
[3830.26 → 3832.68] Probably not, but knowing those guys, maybe.
[3833.64 → 3836.16] Tommy says, bring Channel Super Fun back.
[3837.56 → 3839.62] I hear Channel Super Fun?
[3840.24 → 3842.18] Yeah, you heard Channel Super Fun.
[3843.16 → 3844.72] Hey, one Channel Super Fun.
[3844.76 → 3846.38] That video is like half edited right now.
[3846.46 → 3846.74] Really?
[3846.84 → 3847.32] What is it?
[3847.64 → 3848.88] It's the vlog from Bam.
[3850.18 → 3850.84] Oh, really?
[3850.98 → 3853.08] Someone's spending time editing that mess?
[3854.04 → 3854.76] That's a shame.
[3855.02 → 3856.76] Well, in their downtime.
[3857.98 → 3859.20] Well, no, I don't even care.
[3859.30 → 3860.54] I just mean that it must be painful.
[3861.82 → 3862.64] I think so.
[3863.14 → 3865.52] It was somebody who didn't go on the trip is editing it, too.
[3865.98 → 3866.94] Oh, my goodness.
[3867.66 → 3868.54] That's kind of funny.
[3868.90 → 3876.18] Mr. Boiler says, dear LTT team, Australia just passed a very problematic bill to break
[3876.18 → 3877.86] encryption on any online service.
[3877.96 → 3879.90] I editorialized the very problematic bit.
[3880.04 → 3881.12] This is extremely problematic.
[3881.50 → 3881.76] What?
[3882.30 → 3883.60] Have you not heard about this?
[3883.66 → 3883.80] No.
[3883.80 → 3885.24] I probably should have covered this on the show today.
[3885.30 → 3885.92] It's kind of a big deal.
[3887.30 → 3889.30] Basically, they are mandating backdoors.
[3892.46 → 3892.86] Why?
[3893.60 → 3895.94] I mean, I don't think they're going to do it.
[3896.46 → 3901.06] But if I was Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Amazon.
[3901.26 → 3903.14] Just don't be there anymore.
[3903.14 → 3907.90] And I knew what was, and I thought I knew what was best for my entire industry moving forward,
[3908.06 → 3910.34] I would completely pull out of Australia.
[3910.86 → 3911.98] Like, now.
[3911.98 → 3920.96] Let the Australian people be super mad that they can't reach anybody on any services that
[3920.96 → 3926.28] they are accustomed to using and beat down the doors of their elected representatives
[3926.28 → 3928.76] and get this fixed.
[3928.84 → 3934.30] The fact that Australia is so messed up in regard to how they deal with internet is just
[3934.30 → 3934.92] insane.
[3936.06 → 3938.06] It's such a mess.
[3938.80 → 3939.06] Yeah.
[3939.06 → 3944.08] Neon Visual asks if I can bring the Backstreet Boys back to LTX after the show.
[3944.20 → 3946.40] At like four in the morning, we should play it on the speakers.
[3946.54 → 3947.28] It'd be so amazing.
[3947.52 → 3947.88] Yes.
[3948.76 → 3949.08] Anonymous.
[3949.86 → 3951.08] Got a dream job.
[3952.22 → 3953.74] Want to support my favourite YouTubers.
[3954.22 → 3955.46] Sent $500.
[3956.20 → 3956.56] Wow.
[3957.02 → 3959.38] Is that the maximum you can send in a super chat?
[3959.44 → 3959.96] I think so.
[3960.06 → 3960.92] I have no idea.
[3960.96 → 3961.68] There is a max.
[3962.04 → 3962.58] That's crazy.
[3962.60 → 3963.44] Holy crap.
[3963.58 → 3964.08] Thank you.
[3964.08 → 3964.70] Thanks, Anonymous.
[3966.68 → 3967.98] We're glad to be your favourite.
[3967.98 → 3969.70] We're glad someone else wasn't your favourite.
[3971.20 → 3974.22] Nick says, thank you, Linus and the media group.
[3974.54 → 3975.28] I like that.
[3975.36 → 3976.32] It's kind of like a band.
[3977.16 → 3978.50] Linus and the media group.
[3979.94 → 3982.80] For giving me the confidence to build my first PC today.
[3983.24 → 3983.98] Rock on, man.
[3984.10 → 3985.74] So does that count as having your name in it?
[3988.72 → 3989.64] Linus and the media group?
[3989.86 → 3990.20] Wow.
[3990.56 → 3990.68] Okay.
[3990.76 → 3990.86] No.
[3991.36 → 3991.76] No.
[3991.96 → 3992.48] It doesn't.
[3993.88 → 3994.40] All right.
[3994.40 → 3995.70] I think that's pretty much it.
[3995.86 → 3996.88] Thanks for watching, you guys.
[3996.96 → 3998.02] And we'll see you again next week.
[3998.18 → 3999.50] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3999.92 → 4000.22] Goodbye.
[4001.24 → 4003.04] And we'll see you on Float plane next week.
