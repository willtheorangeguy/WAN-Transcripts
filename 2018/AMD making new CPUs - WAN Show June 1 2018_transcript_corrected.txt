[0.00 → 13.58] it's wan showtime and I am very upset this is uh quite emotionally striking for him
[13.58 → 21.36] right now yeah I am really not sure how to process this right now okay legitimately this is weird
[21.36 → 29.94] yes like even just that part and the fact that in order to like administer the
[29.94 → 37.96] show you have to go that way I go over here like the number of years yeah that I have been sitting
[37.96 → 49.82] to your left yep and this is what happens when we let a prime work on the Wang show set I was just
[49.82 → 59.30] sitting there you were sitting there so you were party to it no yes no yes, yes yes
[59.30 → 67.98] no yes okay so one of my questions is why didn't they just put the little table over here
[67.98 → 77.00] I don't know I'm going to ask them to move it because I can't take this okay one thing too is this the way
[77.00 → 89.38] that we sat uh on the couch no in the really hot room oh hold on no I was on the left still are you
[89.38 → 96.74] sure no I'm pretty sure I was on the left but back then you still had to administer to the left because
[96.74 → 98.42] the table was forward and to the left
[98.42 → 108.80] we're going to go really far back I have to look it up because I don't know uh oh here we go
[108.80 → 116.58] okay whoa yes I used to be on this side yeah, but you would administer in the middle left yeah
[116.58 → 124.34] oh it was if it was in the middle to the left oh okay, okay anyway um other than what is clearly
[124.34 → 132.14] wrong and terrible uh we have a great show for you guys today uh intel launched octane dims yeah
[132.14 → 139.90] so like memory modules but like using octane super cool so that's pretty cool AMD is preparing new CPUs
[139.90 → 144.14] which are super uninteresting, but it's still good that they're doing that, but it's good that they're
[144.14 → 150.06] doing that because the more pressure we put on intel the more likely they are to release something
[150.06 → 156.54] other than octane dims um hey those are still kind of arm is introducing a new processor with
[156.54 → 164.72] insane performance hooray it's going to be the razor processor oh wow did you ever see his keynote on
[164.72 → 172.78] the razor phone no it's insane performance you know what they put so much work into that phone
[172.78 → 179.00] that it was insane yeah it was insane you know it's funny the like the rest of the internet didn't
[179.00 → 184.10] seem to really pick up on that the, or they didn't think it was as funny maybe it's because I know him
[184.10 → 190.68] like maybe that's part of it where like I was just i was watching like someone that I know
[190.68 → 201.46] in real life try to do like CEO keynote guy things and I was like oh man you still have some work to do
[201.46 → 209.00] um what else we've got oh we've got a rumour a couple of rumours that uh apple is going to be
[209.00 → 216.70] launching one iPhone model next year with three rear cameras everyone is getting closer to that uh
[216.70 → 222.98] what was that camera called with like all the oh my yeah uh I don't know start with an l I don't know
[222.98 → 226.38] what it's called I don't remember what there's like a million lenses on the front yeah yeah yeah we're
[226.38 → 232.52] getting closer to that becoming a reality oh also uh the Intel Core i7 80 86k is confirmed so uh
[232.52 → 237.94] we'll get to that after the intro that I don't know maybe it still works I don't know I don't
[237.94 → 249.50] know everything last time it broke and then I fixed it live ah yeah I mean it sure yeah okay so hold on
[249.50 → 258.80] a minute hold on a minute is that the side that I'm on now oh I think it is no because that was made
[258.80 → 267.46] with the black couch yeah oh wow this is messing with my whole world right now I'm actually not even
[267.46 → 279.30] sure so I'm on the right side in their yeah and if oh that's pretty weird we forgot yeah
[279.30 → 287.24] despite it being shown to us twice every week that's a hundred times a year
[287.24 → 296.92] but for three years Geez oh wow all right okay so uh you've had a pretty rough week
[296.92 → 302.78] yeah I've had a pretty rough week yeah and for some different reasons and some of the same reasons
[302.78 → 309.04] so I'm going to go first um I'm leaving for computer I can't give you that mic pack because I have to
[309.04 → 313.54] shoot one more video after this he's changing the mic oh well then I can give you this mic pack
[313.54 → 323.18] so I am flying out for computer very shortly and I will be gone for like 10 days yeah I'm gone
[323.18 → 328.46] for a while I'm going to Taiwan and then china which is of course the same thing right Dennis
[328.46 → 333.70] what I didn't say yes or no you said
[333.70 → 340.44] are you making that sound because you have like a gag order
[340.44 → 345.24] so I'm going to Taiwan then china
[345.24 → 351.06] yeah um oh is he going with you yeah yeah he's going with me
[351.06 → 355.44] oh yeah is it going to be a problem like going to China with a
[355.44 → 360.52] a Taiwanese like who lives in Canada and like works in Canada but he
[360.52 → 364.04] didn't stick over his passport so I think he's probably still okay
[364.04 → 370.12] did you hear about all that no uh there was a thing going around where I don't know if you could get
[370.12 → 373.68] them from the government or if people were making themselves, but it was like semi endorsed from the
[373.68 → 379.20] government at first, and then it wasn't later on, but there was uh stickers that got rid of the
[379.20 → 386.02] republic of china thing or whatever it's called okay like on your Taiwanese passport yeah and then
[386.02 → 393.42] people that travelled with that to China were like super denied entry wow yeah, but he has not done this
[393.42 → 398.12] well that's interesting isn't it please let him in China yeah that would be good so I'm going to
[398.12 → 403.32] Taiwan then china so I'm going to be gone for 10 days but yeah you're going to notice something
[403.32 → 411.38] really weird while I'm gone there's going to be a LTT video every day yeah so that's been this week
[411.38 → 420.88] and last week and actually the one before and then also we shot another season of
[420.88 → 427.32] tech showdown I was gonna mess with them, I was going to say tech showdown because then they'd be
[427.32 → 439.64] like oh dang no, no one loves tech showdown, and you know what I guess that's okay yeah that's
[439.64 → 445.76] probably fine because frankly I don't really love it either um yeah it had potential it did it had
[445.76 → 453.16] potential I liked the first episodes more it's like it's like the sixth child you know there was
[453.16 → 460.34] so much potential, but you just didn't really put the work into it, and it came out half-baked and
[460.34 → 469.46] so yes wow new season of scrapyard wars I apologize for all the six children out there and guys
[469.46 → 481.40] the shtick this time is pretty insane it's actually insane so it's just a classic Linus versus Luke
[481.40 → 488.94] which I don't think we've done since season two with the water cooling challenge has it been that long
[488.94 → 496.52] yeah because after that it was the three-way with Austin and then there was BS mods yeah and then there
[496.52 → 504.52] was uh 2v2 down in la and that's all six seasons 2v2 up here yeah wow that's right with jay's two
[504.52 → 512.50] cents yeah that's it interesting so it's a classic Linus versus Luke yeah, but the challenge is oh
[512.50 → 519.16] okay, so this is a multi-parter in terms of the challenge and it is just keeps getting worse
[519.16 → 526.76] first we can't use the internet that's enough right there which it didn't even occur to
[526.76 → 536.32] me means no email and no Google Maps both of those things didn't initially click for me uh that
[536.32 → 542.16] was a that was a pretty big deal I treat email like long text messages yeah like I don't think of them
[542.16 → 548.20] as anything other than straight utility like just part of my life I think of Google Maps like GPS
[548.20 → 553.18] yes I don't really think about obviously it has traffic data and stuff included in it but i never
[553.18 → 559.04] think like I am going to use the internet to find my way to this thing exactly and like to be clear
[559.04 → 565.36] we're not stupid we understand that these services function over the internet yeah, but it's
[565.36 → 571.84] just not something you don't you think about yeah okay because it's become so routine so anyway so
[571.84 → 578.02] yeah no use of the internet no use of Google Maps also no use of GPS so if your car had a built-in GPS
[578.02 → 582.12] you can't do that because that would have been unfair because both cars didn't and not everybody
[582.12 → 588.00] has GPS in their car, and it somewhat defeats the purpose anyway um of not being able to use the
[588.00 → 594.90] internet yeah uh, so then there was the next real challenge there was like there's enough
[594.90 → 599.98] obscurity there's enough difficulty already and then Colton on the day of i didn't know this was
[599.98 → 605.18] coming was like by the way it's the best bang for your buck competition there's no fixed price I didn't
[605.18 → 610.00] know that either yeah so I knew that the challenge was going to be no internet, but it hadn't really
[610.00 → 616.50] occurred to me what exactly that meant when I heard that I was like oh yeah okay so I can't Craigslist
[616.50 → 620.70] and I can't find people online yes I didn't think about the email part I didn't think about the maps
[620.70 → 624.30] part yeah right when we were standing there and I was thinking like how am I going to do this i
[624.30 → 628.98] immediately thought of those things and best bang for the buck challenges are in a lot of ways
[628.98 → 633.90] much more difficult oh yeah than having a fixed budget and trying to build the best machine
[633.90 → 643.10] for that budget because all of a sudden any strategy from fifty dollars all the way up to
[643.10 → 651.94] five thousand dollars yeah has the potential depending on the workload to be the best bang for the buck
[651.94 → 662.40] yeah like you could show up with literally an old tower from 2012 that you found in a back alley
[662.40 → 669.64] for zero dollars and if it gets one fps in the game you have an infinity score you're guaranteed to win
[669.64 → 677.72] you win yeah so um it is like the best bang for your buck challenge is enough in itself that was season
[677.72 → 684.08] three yeah that was the competition in season three then there's the no internet then there's the no GPS
[684.08 → 691.74] it was intense so we've got people uh joey Pomeroy asks when does this all air that is a tremendous
[691.74 → 698.66] question so we've said we're going to do this before but this time our sponsor is being super cool about
[698.66 → 704.08] it and brand has basically said yeah we understand you guys want to do it up right
[704.08 → 711.32] and so what we're going to do is we are going to pre-edit the entire thing so that we can get all
[711.32 → 718.50] the pacing right, and then we've said this we've I know we've said this multiple times yeah but this
[718.50 → 723.78] time we're and you know what every time we've gotten closer actually yes yeah like last time we
[723.78 → 730.50] storyboarded the whole thing and edited at least more than one and then I think the editing on season
[730.50 → 736.86] four was the best I still maintain that I don't know what happened that year so but yeah so we are
[736.86 → 742.78] going to have the whole thing pre-edited so we can make sure the pacing of the season is right and it
[742.78 → 746.96] actually should be a little bit easier to get the pacing right because one of the biggest criticisms
[746.96 → 755.96] that I have as a viewer of scrapyard wars is that the first episode is always just us typing on
[755.96 → 762.12] Craigslist and yeah I agree just talking like mumbo jumbo model numbers number model blah blah
[762.12 → 768.14] blah to combine this with that price whatever yeah whereas when you don't have the internet
[768.14 → 773.52] you basically have to go we both immediately started driving hoof it yeah we spent like
[773.52 → 778.56] a couple of minutes I sat with my head on my desk for a while yeah and like I stood around for a sec
[778.56 → 782.94] and then was like okay yeah I'm going to go here but like there was no googling obviously
[782.94 → 789.50] or existing so I don't want to spoil anything for you but you guys need to watch this season
[789.50 → 798.56] and i will tell you one thing that I did I made a sign to go in the back window of my car
[798.56 → 806.34] with my phone number on it your actual phone number that basically said want to buy gaming computer
[806.34 → 815.30] did anyone call SMS this number no okay so an idea I had that I didn't do so it's not even a spoiler
[815.30 → 819.54] I guess was uh setting up one of those signs and like sitting at a bus loop
[819.54 → 827.70] I didn't do it I mean how did this is the stuff we came down to okay this was hard how did people
[827.70 → 835.70] find each other before the internet I don't even know okay well I thought about this uh yeah but
[835.70 → 841.78] but you wouldn't do it anymore but classifieds and stuff right i I can't where would you find a
[841.78 → 846.82] newspaper that's that's and like no one's going to do that any more, so there's no point what kind of
[846.82 → 852.68] like a technology savvy person would post something in a newspaper exactly so yeah there's really no point
[852.68 → 859.24] but like I think that's what they would have done oh man back in the day um yeah so anyway
[860.20 → 866.28] it's going to be great um swap meets I think it uh oh yeah but who runs a swap meet from no I know I'm
[866.28 → 870.84] just whose day no I'm saying like I thought of these things yeah yeah yeah i I even thought of like what
[870.84 → 877.32] if there's like a land party or something and I could just go and like to buy a ticket and ask people if
[877.32 → 884.44] they want to sell me their computer like at a land I got an offer to borrow one like I could rent a
[884.44 → 885.40] computer from someone
[888.28 → 893.72] which technically like isn't against the rules that violate the spirit of the competition exactly
[893.72 → 899.16] for sure which is why I didn't do it but like the guy was like yeah you could like to rent my computer
[899.16 → 904.36] and like direct it for like a week and then just bring it back
[906.52 → 913.00] I was like I there's technically no rule against that but like not okay one he knew me
[913.00 → 918.12] oh it wouldn't have been fair either way yeah so that it was pre-grenade but like while
[918.12 → 922.84] I was standing there I was thinking like if he didn't like maybe I could ask people I don't know
[922.84 → 928.60] that probably no one would do it I would never even know that you rented it
[930.36 → 937.08] if you were just like I got this for 10 bucks I'd have to be mad but like
[937.88 → 943.64] well you'd watch the episode and figure it out yeah I think I'd take back your trophy yeah i I think i
[943.64 → 949.80] I think I would take back your trophy if you won like that that's not cool yeah because I have been
[949.80 → 955.16] known to take back a trophy you know if I feel like how skeptical would you be I've been mistreated
[955.16 → 959.48] I feel like you would have been digging and figured it out on the spot you know no I probably would
[959.48 → 964.52] have believed you like you, you've been you've been honest with me over the years no okay if I was
[964.52 → 971.08] like a full it's probably having LEDs in it like it probably has a window if I'm renting a gaming
[971.08 → 977.24] tower from someone okay right yeah no okay like i I doubt you I would ask prying questions I'd be like
[977.24 → 984.60] yes who did you get it from did they know you where did you get it can, I buy one of these now
[985.64 → 991.72] if I go there can I get one how many can we buy and flip and make tons exactly, exactly
[992.68 → 1001.32] so oh I think people are really confused so I said if you won with that strategy I would take the trophy
[1001.32 → 1006.12] yeah yeah um all right because if you rent a computer for ten dollars you're probably going to
[1006.12 → 1013.48] win that was like the would never spoil scrapyard wars you guys no scrapyard wars is like it's like
[1013.48 → 1020.12] sacred around here it is you do not talk about scrapyard wars outside the company to ensure
[1020.12 → 1026.60] even a lot of people internally yeah don't know who wins until the episodes come out so all right
[1026.60 → 1030.68] did you want to do some like actual tech news or something at some point what do you think might as well
[1030.68 → 1037.48] I guess so I mean we the people all came all the way here from uh, and you know they clearly don't
[1037.48 → 1041.64] know where to get their tech news because they haven't already watched all of this yeah um
[1043.64 → 1050.84] so this was originally posted by I'm a razor on the forum and uh I think it's just I'm razor oh okay
[1050.84 → 1062.68] well whatever and the original article is from oops um uh uh uh properties uh deactivate uh activate uh
[1063.24 → 1071.16] do was this not tested uh duplicate um maybe not um, um oh wait wait wait hold on new idea
[1071.16 → 1077.24] new idea is that even the right one uh uh uh hey oh, oh
[1077.24 → 1089.16] oh yeah block them notifications all right um intel launches octane dims, so these are sort of
[1090.52 → 1101.64] ddr4 sticks except they're only ddr4 in the sense that they fit in a ddr4 slot
[1101.64 → 1113.16] but they are not ddr4 because the actual chips on them are not dram they are not ddr4 right
[1115.40 → 1122.44] that's interesting so basically they're announcing the availability, but it's not like you can actually
[1122.44 → 1127.48] buy one right now it looks like they will be sampling these uh
[1127.48 → 1134.20] uh they're sampling them now, and they will be shipping them for revenue later this year but
[1134.20 → 1139.56] only to select customers and then broad availability is planned for some time in 2019.
[1140.20 → 1146.68] so in a nutshell or actually let's go through some more specs first so they'll be using octane DC
[1147.32 → 1153.16] sorry they'll be branded as octane DC persistent memory so that's data centre not direct current and
[1153.16 → 1161.16] this is in contrast with octane DC SSDs, so those would be like PCI Express or um NVMe or
[1161.16 → 1168.44] whatever else um just regular SSDs m2, and they are not to be confused with the consumer-oriented
[1169.00 → 1174.60] octane memory caching SSDs that was such a terrible name for that product like they should have just
[1174.60 → 1180.44] called it like the octane accelerator or something yes octane memory you literally you on the spot you
[1180.44 → 1186.20] just made a far better name for it, and you know what the stupidest part of that is when i was at
[1186.20 → 1195.16] their launch event when they were launching octane memory they briefed us on this they knew this was
[1195.16 → 1205.88] coming they knew actual octane on a dim for servers was coming, and they still called the little m.2
[1205.88 → 1215.72] thing that accelerates your hard drive octane memory unbelievable intel i love you guys dearly
[1216.76 → 1222.12] but holy crap you can probably uh contact one of the business guys about having us help you with
[1222.12 → 1228.84] your naming schemes yeah you know a new business we'd actually be really for Linus media group you
[1228.84 → 1234.60] know you know uh Asus you know how many people have asked me um when we're going to do the next Asus rogue
[1234.60 → 1240.36] rig reboot do you know where that name came from i know this story but I'm going to pretend that i don't
[1240.36 → 1246.92] because it will work better if you're telling me for the first time so no wow you just completely
[1247.56 → 1255.48] you completely ruined everything for me right now um I've never this is I'm so interested where did
[1255.48 → 1262.92] where did kg rig reboot come from okay so they originally um when we were when we were pitching
[1262.92 → 1269.72] this uh they sent us oh what were what were the names that they pitched us because we were
[1269.72 → 1276.44] supposed it was really our bad we were supposed to get back to them like it was over a span of weeks
[1276.44 → 1283.88] they were uh because they pitched us a name, and we thought it was like terrible and or generic
[1283.88 → 1290.84] um that's a great picture uh yeah twitch chat should probably see that picture okay so just
[1291.56 → 1300.36] i have a really weird relationship with my Asus rep um I'm just going to see if there's don't show your
[1300.36 → 1306.20] screen right now though uh is there anything there is right there okay, okay i got it yeah
[1306.20 → 1311.96] anything in here uh no that should all be fine okay yeah yeah i can show my screen now okay
[1311.96 → 1319.96] um, so this is an email that he sent to me, we're kind of rethinking the whole program at the moment
[1320.60 → 1325.56] um, so this was when we weren't sure if we were going to be working together on it socks with sandals do
[1325.56 → 1332.28] not create the branding image that we are after here the whole neo-chic glam southern surfer rockabilly
[1332.28 → 1339.32] theme is great but come on even the socks are white and so this is an uh this is a tweet that we had sent
[1339.32 → 1346.84] out uh around that time that is me in case you guys are wondering so if you're feeling a little
[1347.64 → 1353.48] you know a little aroused it's totally fine hot and heavy yeah yeah um anyway so they
[1353.48 → 1357.96] totally understand idea and i was super busy and had no time to think about it
[1357.96 → 1362.76] so Colton walked into my office he's like look I'm not leaving your office
[1363.64 → 1368.76] until you give me a name to give them because good job that's the last thing holding up moving
[1368.76 → 1377.96] forward with this project, and so I'm like oh i don't know maybe like um rogue rig reboot and then
[1377.96 → 1385.96] if they hate that like come back to me literally on the spot we should offer us naming things as a
[1385.96 → 1392.04] consulting fee based like service to companies because they're so bad at it like did you know
[1392.04 → 1398.12] that Seagate's rebranding for their drives you know iron wolf yeah, and they still have barracuda
[1398.12 → 1405.40] i like sky hawk iron wolf pro okay i like it too i think they did a good job but get this
[1405.40 → 1413.88] to come up with that scheme they hired the person who did the colour based branding over at WD yeah
[1415.96 → 1423.24] they couldn't just copy if it's not like there was an it's not like there was any kind of you know
[1424.12 → 1431.16] secret like they already had barracuda i know like just keep going barracuda was cool
[1431.16 → 1438.76] you kept it swordfish drive sure shark i don't know like and like the like barracuda has like
[1438.76 → 1443.48] two kind of steps through it so iron wolf makes sense why did you like shark is maybe a little bit
[1443.48 → 1450.76] to sure why did you have to hire someone to come up with that like I'm not trying to be a jerk or
[1450.76 → 1459.48] anything again Seagate my friends i everyone I've ever met from Seagate love you dearly but holy crap
[1459.48 → 1465.56] um what were we even talking about i don't even know oh right obtain memory oh right right right
[1465.56 → 1471.96] okay, okay well no you never actually got you said Colton came into your office right oh yeah i just
[1471.96 → 1477.08] mean i came up with it on the spot because i had no time to think about it like within a minute or two
[1477.08 → 1482.28] it's not like Colton stayed there for a few hours and now i get people like messaging me or like walking
[1482.28 → 1486.36] up to me at conventions being like i loved rogue rig reboot when are you going to do that again like
[1486.36 → 1495.96] it's a thing now oh yeah intel hit us up all right so octane problem DC persistent memory
[1496.52 → 1504.04] oh uh initially available in 128 gigs just you know i like how searchable that name is 256
[1505.00 → 1514.44] and up to 512 gigs on a single module yo dude you got crazy ODC pm in your computer yeah dog
[1514.44 → 1521.56] um, so the modules are pin compatible with standard ddr4 dims and will be supported by intel's next
[1521.56 → 1529.40] generation Leon server platforms so whoever they are currently sampling these things to apparently
[1529.40 → 1535.56] also have intel's next gen server stuff yeah so that gives us some hints as to soon uh that gives us some
[1535.56 → 1541.88] hints as to when we might see those rolling out and um broad availability is planned for 2019 they're not
[1541.88 → 1545.96] officially disclosing whether it will be possible to mix and match d ram and obtain persistent memory
[1545.96 → 1553.32] on the same memory controller channel and the 192 gigs of ram for the development preview systems
[1553.32 → 1559.24] indicate that they are equipped with a 16 gig d ram dim on every memory channel so maybe also not
[1559.24 → 1565.08] disclosed power consumption clock speeds specific endurance ratings other than them saying that they
[1565.08 → 1572.12] should last for a similar lifetime to the server with their regular memory that's in it um so i actually
[1572.12 → 1578.28] have to tag out with jams um which is going to be probably a double swap uh i actually i sorry yeah
[1578.28 → 1584.60] yes but uh first i would really like to tell you guys about oh savage jerky so that i can eat
[1584.60 → 1585.24] the jerky
[1587.96 → 1591.56] is that okay can I do at least the savage jerky spot yeah that's fine
[1591.56 → 1598.12] uh oh i don't have my notes because normally i load them up on there you don't know the savage
[1598.12 → 1603.72] jerky notes well basically a high quality snack that's made with fresh ingredients without nitrates
[1603.72 → 1609.00] or preservatives that's not bad for you, they've got 13 different flavours of jerky tastes good you guys
[1609.00 → 1615.72] want some jerky I'm down all right 13 different flavours including my favourite the maple buffalo bacon
[1615.72 → 1621.96] mmm they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub their Carolina reaper hot sauce uses one
[1621.96 → 1625.48] of the hottest peppers in the world the Carolina reaper
[1627.88 → 1635.80] and i have to say you can use offer code LTT to save 10 at savage jerky.com, but you probably shouldn't
[1636.68 → 1643.16] because the more of it you eat the more you need to keep ordering it i think i have a problem
[1645.72 → 1653.40] um okay I'm going to let you do honey and I'm going to go do one more video about something super cool

[1666.20 → 1671.32] going to be able to open up the YouTube analytics and see the drop-off we'll be able to quantify just

[1703.16 → 1707.40] bunch on the list and most of them don't work, and they're all really annoying and blah blah blah it
[1707.40 → 1712.20] does it all for you instead of having all that annoying stuff it works you don't get it i don't

[1769.24 → 1778.04] your browser today honey sweet let me have spectrum do you have yours here oh i had them sitting here for
[1778.04 → 1784.44] weeks is this them yes those are ones i normally wear but i like this orange box oh let me try it done
[1784.44 → 1789.48] I'm going to wear these oh yeah these aren't going to be for me these are kind of those are a
[1789.48 → 1795.96] little bit they're feminine yes wow there we go spectrum staring at your monitor all day can be hard
[1795.96 → 1800.84] on your eyes and also make it tougher to fall asleep that's the latter note on that is my least
[1800.84 → 1806.36] favourite part spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at your computer screen or phone
[1806.36 → 1812.44] actually as well uh using a software solution like f.lux and twilight will not give you the same type of
[1812.44 → 1818.20] filtering that these glasses do features include that they're stylish you might not like these on me
[1818.20 → 1823.88] because I'm a very weird fit for glasses but i think jams looks better in those and if i had
[1823.88 → 1829.96] different ones they might look better, or you do like these on me who knows um they're also nice quality
[1829.96 → 1835.40] and have a one-year warranty which is good we've had these for over a year now i think oh yeah
[1835.40 → 1839.96] and they look brand-new still yeah fair i like how flexible and light these puppies are
[1839.96 → 1847.40] boom uh they have low colour distortion they block high energy blue light while keeping colours as
[1847.40 → 1853.64] similar as possible so yeah that that is a thing any of these glasses will have a very minor amount
[1853.64 → 1858.12] of colour change, and it is this is pretty minor a little bit noticeable, but it is very minor I've had
[1858.12 → 1862.76] other ones that are a lot worse i will tell you that much uh they're primarily focused around Canadian
[1862.76 → 1867.96] us markets, but they are working on expanding into Europe, and they do offer shipping internationally
[1867.96 → 1872.84] they also now sell at memory express for Canadians that's interesting and for the month of even
[1872.84 → 1878.20] know that yeah i had no idea good for them um and for the month of June they'll be offering 20
[1878.20 → 1886.28] off spectrum glasses check them out at spectrumglasses.com slash collections slash pro spec or prospect
[1886.92 → 1892.36] i think it's pro spec or on memory express or through the link below if you're on YouTube today i
[1892.36 → 1899.72] didn't have the right banner up i noticed you say coupon coupon coupon i say I'm a coup person coupon
[1899.72 → 1907.80] coupon I'm not saying you're wrong it is an u not a double o so coupon i don't know i like that
[1908.36 → 1911.40] okay I'm going to leave this banner up for a little bit because i forgot to put it up
[1911.40 → 1918.44] uh before then i have no idea what you guys have spoken about so uh topics in a line definitely not
[1918.44 → 1925.96] what definitely not that one let's talk about that one okay there was it's been removed how long was it
[1925.96 → 1934.04] up there okay let's let's explain school shooting game on steam has been removed uh rightfully so in my
[1934.04 → 1941.88] opinion yeah active shooter and wow yeah straight up an unreleased steam game in which you play as a
[1941.88 → 1947.00] school shooter a swat team member trying to neutralize them or a civilian has been removed from the
[1947.00 → 1953.88] platform and both the developer and publisher revived games and acid respectively responsible
[1953.88 → 1959.80] for the game have been banned from the platform the game's trailer depicts a player running down high
[1959.80 → 1965.64] school halls and through classrooms indiscriminately murdering teachers until a swap team shows up
[1968.20 → 1976.76] wow who how could you possibly think apparently when they first were making the game it was
[1977.40 → 1983.48] you couldn't play as the school shooter you could only play as the swat team person neutralizing them
[1983.48 → 1989.56] it was just like a swat game with like veiled in that kind of scenario and then
[1989.56 → 1994.68] someone genius was like you know how we can just you should be able to play on the other side you
[1994.68 → 2001.72] can be a terrorist in counterstrike you got to be a psychopath like there's no amount of slimy
[2001.72 → 2006.12] there's no amount of slimy greasy marketing like whoa we'll get a lot of attention, or we'll make money
[2006.12 → 2011.40] there's no amount of that that can motivate you to be bad and sensitive what does chat think what do you
[2011.40 → 2020.60] think chat oh everyone can see sorry whoa intro no whoa it was scrolled i couldn't click on main
[2021.80 → 2032.04] sociopath how is this worse than GTA uh very worse i would say it's very worse very much worse do
[2033.24 → 2040.36] because it in my opinion in this one you are set up specifically to do that in GTA it's its a choice
[2040.36 → 2046.12] yeah well i mean you do have to rip people out of their cars at least you don't have to punch
[2046.76 → 2051.72] survival sex workers or shoot or randomly shoot people walking down the street you have a choice
[2051.72 → 2056.12] uh and i guess arguably in this game you don't have to play as a shooter you could only neutralize
[2056.12 → 2061.08] them i suppose uh the other thing is this is just so much more topical you can't shoot up schools
[2062.12 → 2065.40] i think in the in fairness in this game you cannot shoot children
[2065.40 → 2068.36] you own i don't even know if there are children present it might only be teachers
[2070.28 → 2074.84] but still this is just so much more topical in GTA it's open world and like anything can happen
[2074.84 → 2079.32] it's supposed to just simulate the amount of variables that exist in the real world whereas
[2079.32 → 2084.84] this is just specifically like hey this tragedy that affects now hundreds of families in the US like
[2084.84 → 2090.36] every week, and it's like the greatest tragedy that could happen really no lets just do that
[2090.36 → 2098.60] no the other argument here is that is censorship some people think steam should be completely
[2099.56 → 2105.88] open for whatever and some people think their stakes is too far i mean it's a platform that they
[2105.88 → 2112.60] own this isn't a government system so they can kind of do whatever they want sure they can but should
[2112.60 → 2118.20] but what should their philosophy yeah i mean that's up to them like at the end of the day they're a
[2118.20 → 2122.12] business if you don't like that they're removing this go somewhere else well i think they removed
[2122.12 → 2127.08] it in response to outcry because this is i read about this topic it was posted last Saturday i
[2127.08 → 2131.16] believe on the forum originally, and then it's been updated that they did respond i mean the
[2131.16 → 2135.72] graphics look terrible was this even on their radar it would have been one of those brutal like no one
[2135.72 → 2139.40] knows about a game that's what I'm talking about maybe that's why like they probably had no clue it
[2139.40 → 2144.36] looks it looks like junk i don't know personally, but it looks like junk some of the people most of
[2144.36 → 2148.52] the people on the game the forums associated with the game it was made for outrage marketing
[2148.52 → 2155.32] by making a game with stolen assets as a cheap cash grab maker was banned because their record of
[2155.32 → 2159.40] making stolen asset games yeah so it was just some like junk game thrown together in no time
[2160.68 → 2166.12] yeah it probably wasn't on steam's and the dude the publisher developer dude uh has a history of
[2166.12 → 2172.36] customer reviews and publishing copyright material so and user review manipulation so he's just like so
[2172.36 → 2179.80] banned but in the forums related to the game some people most of the people were saying get this
[2179.80 → 2187.16] game off of here off the platform, but some people were saying um that they criticized valve for the
[2187.16 → 2192.36] fact that it gives the boot to many games contain nudity while letting the likes of active
[2192.36 → 2197.00] shooter state this is prior to the ban people were saying that it's kind of like a free the nipple thing
[2197.00 → 2202.04] like you're on Instagram and there's you can be so scantily cloud and covered in oil and putting your
[2202.04 → 2207.16] butt up against camera, but you can't be like breastfeeding yeah i don't know it's
[2209.16 → 2215.80] i maintain to a certain degree that like freedom of speech and whatnot is a government-based thing
[2216.76 → 2224.84] and it doesn't apply to that platform if that platform is like i don't want you shooting teachers
[2224.84 → 2232.20] in a game they have full right to take that off their platform if it becomes discriminatory for
[2232.20 → 2236.92] some reason then it's a different issue but i don't think that's the case valve seems to have
[2236.92 → 2242.76] known who this person was pre-existing troll history of manipulation and other things they probably
[2242.76 → 2246.60] would have banned it just because he's banned regardless I'm pretty sure he was already banned
[2246.60 → 2252.36] and just made a new thing to put this up possible so like it might not even have to do with the game
[2252.36 → 2256.20] itself it might just have to do with the fact that they don't want him releasing stuff on the platform
[2256.20 → 2261.64] here's a question for you, you know however since the first match school shooting columbine people
[2261.64 → 2268.52] have been blaming video games notably Grand Theft Auto and music like merlin Manson music and most gamers
[2269.08 → 2274.12] so many thousands of gamers have been like look like games are not the reason that these things are
[2274.12 → 2279.56] happening well there's been studies that have proved that to sure what about a game like this
[2279.56 → 2285.88] do you think a game like this that's so like it's a simulation of the event do you think that
[2285.88 → 2289.72] could desensitize a person make them more likely to carry out such a heinous crime i think we're
[2289.72 → 2296.84] getting down a little bit of a weird path here um i don't think playing a video game facilitates
[2296.84 → 2303.72] doing a crime because uh i don't think playing Call of Duty inspires anyone to join the army
[2304.12 → 2312.36] if that makes sense i think there are some games that can do things like that uh but like there's
[2312.36 → 2316.60] there's a video that i like that's online that takes like a pro counterstrike player and they
[2316.60 → 2321.24] give him like the gun that the mains with, and he shoots one bullet, and he's like I'm done
[2323.24 → 2325.56] i didn't enjoy that i don't want to do it anymore and just leaves
[2326.12 → 2331.08] um so like it doesn't necessarily inspire that i think if you are interested in cars
[2331.08 → 2337.24] and then start you can go are you waiting okay all right you can just there's no other way so like
[2337.24 → 2343.56] well uh way to block the camera what are you thinking okay what are you ahead of shake man
[2343.56 → 2351.64] uh if you are already into cars, and you start playing like i don't know Sforza uh Sforza five sure
[2351.64 → 2359.24] yeah um it's that will probably just drive that further drive it'll steer you in that direction
[2359.24 → 2364.36] yeah yeah yeah it'll, it'll like it's already a passion of yours so you're doing something within
[2364.36 → 2371.56] that range and it kind of just accelerates it yeah yeah you're not putting on the brakes you're you're
[2371.56 → 2377.56] trying to immerse yourself more in that right, right um and i don't think like maybe if you're like
[2377.56 → 2382.76] obsessed with this stuff, and you're already watching like every new poorly done news article
[2382.76 → 2386.84] where they talk about the shooter a lot, and they say his name and all this kind of stuff, and you're
[2386.84 → 2393.40] like really into that type of thing, and then you start playing this game like it might be a
[2393.40 → 2398.68] component sure, but it's not going to be like it's not the source there's i don't think anyone's going
[2398.68 → 2403.80] to play this and be like i have to go do it like i don't I don't think that's going to happen i think
[2403.80 → 2409.16] you are already since they banned it yeah yeah you can't now good yeah i think if you're already
[2409.16 → 2413.80] obsessed with the thing and already immersing yourself in it so much it might be a component
[2413.80 → 2419.96] of your insanity but like it's not do you think there's any way that a game like if you're a person
[2419.96 → 2427.64] like that a game like this could um offer you release and make you less likely i have no idea i am
[2427.64 → 2436.44] not a psychologist um probably varies greatly between individuals yes it as a lot of things do um
[2436.44 → 2439.40] because people make out arguments like that uh for prostitution
[2442.20 → 2442.60] like you
[2445.56 → 2445.96] Facebook
[2449.96 → 2452.44] to remove the trending topics i love it like you
[2452.44 → 2462.04] okay all right sorry Facebook doing something i don't even want to read that topic
[2462.04 → 2465.24] and that's about all there is to it, they're removing the trending topic sections the side
[2465.24 → 2469.16] of your news feed they've got a couple of things uh there that are trending hashtags usually they're
[2469.16 → 2473.72] news articles that are a few days behind twitter anyway and for like four years it's been up there
[2473.72 → 2477.08] and people have always been questioning how Facebook chooses now they're just getting rid of it all
[2477.08 → 2484.52] together, and they are working on some other um some other types or ways of delivering news to you
[2485.40 → 2489.24] including breaking news labels and a section that collects local stories
[2491.96 → 2497.08] do you have an opinion on this thing with star citizen and how you can get you can buy this pack
[2497.08 → 2501.64] of DLC that includes every item in the game, but that pack costs 27
[2501.64 → 2512.84] thousand dollars yeah no i think spending 27 000 on a game uh that doesn't have a like full release
[2512.84 → 2521.64] date yet and might never fully release is probably a solid investment plan in the post bitcoin boom
[2522.84 → 2529.80] i like it so here's the thing because this may be this may be a limited time offer
[2529.80 → 2536.92] so you could spend 27 grand and then sell those ships on the black market wow and if you call
[2536.92 → 2540.60] in the next five minutes you can have a dancing French guy walking in front of your camera yeah
[2540.60 → 2547.64] shaking his butt in the screen guess what he's coming back again wow not one but two wow
[2548.84 → 2551.88] this is supposed to be the least used set yeah well
[2551.88 → 2561.64] so here's the thing though i once ran in i was in Latvia and i had lunch with this couple
[2561.64 → 2566.44] from California and they both worked in the mobile gaming space in Silicon Valley in the marketing end
[2566.44 → 2572.12] of it, and they were telling me they worked for games like Candy Crush, and they said that the
[2572.12 → 2576.84] the biggest percentage of your money comes from wales it's its like 99 yeah like it's so much of it comes
[2576.84 → 2582.92] from wales there's people who spend over 100 grand a year the the the vast majority of your user base
[2582.92 → 2591.00] in the mobile gaming space doesn't matter at all so is this a way of taking money from leveraging
[2592.12 → 2598.44] like the whales like do you care what the whales who the 27 000 is equivalent worth
[2599.00 → 2604.36] to you and me like 80 bucks like or less like this guy's like a Saudi prince he's like oh
[2604.36 → 2608.84] i can have all of them like cool boom done the thing is though this isn't even they're not even
[2608.84 → 2613.16] getting like unique items it's not like you're getting a one of a kind no one else is getting
[2613.16 → 2617.24] this ship only you have this ship it's just all of them you just get everything and everything in
[2617.24 → 2624.12] this case is 117 ships and 163 extras I'm not familiar with the game what would those extras be
[2624.12 → 2631.00] weapons vehicles skins uh different guns different uh modifications to the ships
[2631.00 → 2634.92] literally a poster in your hangar uh it can be a lot of stuff
[2636.84 → 2642.44] lots of stuff that's cool that's worth it is like a little model of one of the ships that goes digitally
[2642.44 → 2647.64] in your hangar in the game like that that could be what it is yeah there 's's a lot of little
[2647.64 → 2653.24] extras this game's a kickstarter still it's not out right this seems like a perfect way to fundraise
[2653.24 → 2658.92] from those whales get the get it out there for the rest of us, but we were fundraising in like what
[2658.92 → 2668.04] 2012 like what year did this start can I find the original star citizen kickstarter
[2670.28 → 2679.08] kickstarter star citizen October 18th of 2012 holy cow yeah dude whoa this is like duke nuke forever
[2679.08 → 2684.68] status like, but they're still selling stuff, and they made they raised over two million dollars
[2684.68 → 2685.40] originally
[2687.64 → 2688.36] make the game
[2690.28 → 2695.88] they burned through dude it's over we need an estimated delivery November oh no hold on let's
[2695.88 → 2702.36] see one more little uh detail here is that you don't even have access to buying this 27 000
[2702.92 → 2708.36] pack of goodies unless you've already spent a thousand bucks which is so sweet you can't even view the page
[2709.08 → 2714.84] that's awesome because it's it adds this exclusivity layer which i would imagine is oh so tantalizing
[2714.84 → 2716.44] to the whales who can afford this
[2719.80 → 2725.32] how much has star citizen raised in 2018 we're googling here stars isn't raised more money than
[2725.32 → 2732.36] every other video game on kickstarter combined holy cow 2017 i think this DLC pack has got to be the most
[2732.36 → 2743.80] most expensive game related content ever Chris Roberts collection of space faring games raised 34.91 million in 2017
[2747.00 → 2749.24] like my god
[2751.64 → 2752.68] it's so crazy
[2754.28 → 2760.52] stretch goals okay does it show their total on here funding stats all right
[2760.52 → 2766.52] look at that
[2769.00 → 2772.52] eight whoa 100 and set 187 million
[2774.36 → 2780.36] dollar uh whoa what is that other statistic it says star citizens is that how many people yes
[2780.36 → 2784.92] probably all time probably doesn't include churn it's not current yeah
[2786.76 → 2790.52] to what there's two million people playing no there's two million people that like have accounts
[2791.40 → 2796.92] i think it's too many people that have paid some amount of money oh wow that's my assumption so let me
[2796.92 → 2800.04] i just wanted to make sure they're not like procedurally generated citizens or something
[2800.04 → 2807.40] no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no 187 that is so much money
[2809.96 → 2816.44] how much okay here hold on like the lottery is 30 million usually well some are that big
[2818.44 → 2820.76] what are you trying to find out how much money would it take to uh
[2820.76 → 2831.24] uh so GTA 5 costs 265 million dollars so GTA 5 still cost a bunch more, but that's how much they've
[2831.24 → 2840.92] crowdfunded that's insane i wonder if we could crowdfund a Falcon 9 rocket to like just like guys
[2840.92 → 2847.96] you're all get oh my god okay uh cards against humanity you know how they dug the hole no you
[2847.96 → 2856.92] didn't hear about that no uh i know they mailed people poop and stuff i mean its humanity hole
[2859.08 → 2862.28] cards against humanity raises a hundred thousand dollars to dig tremendous hole
[2863.00 → 2866.76] were they allowed heavy equipment yeah i see some heavy equipment in the picture it'd be
[2866.76 → 2871.40] better if it was just shovels a bunch of people with shovels i heard of some dudes who
[2871.40 → 2876.20] went to a party i don't know if it's a grad party or what, but they just decided to dig and they just
[2876.20 → 2881.32] spent the whole party digging and in the morning whoever the host is just has a giant hole in their
[2881.32 → 2886.04] backyard and has to like to show their parents oh my god yeah they weren't invited that's horrible
[2888.20 → 2896.28] okay so yeah so uh hole got dug is apparently or holiday hole sorry holiday hole.com
[2896.28 → 2901.64] was a website dedicated to the hole set up by cards against humanity and as long as money kept
[2901.64 → 2905.80] coming in they would keep digging, so people had to live donate money, and they would keep digging
[2905.80 → 2912.12] well they got more expensive over time or something uh well like they could pre-purchase time oh and
[2912.12 → 2916.84] it got more expensive over time, and apparently they got a hundred thousand dollars so if we could get
[2916.84 → 2923.00] enough money for Falcon 9 to just send like something stupid like this is what they should do
[2923.00 → 2927.48] next like a car with a dummy in it or something you know yeah you know what i mean like cards against
[2927.48 → 2933.88] humanity should send like in a whole Falcon 9 rocket like just cards against humanity cards into space
[2935.00 → 2941.08] wow that should be their next like a stack of them shaped like a tree like it looks like a tree
[2941.08 → 2945.48] it's made of tree parts holiday rocket there you play cards against humanity there it is that's what you
[2945.48 → 2953.24] should do well that'd be great is that it um i think we should do one more okay all right
[2954.68 → 2960.92] I'll allow it Asus mining motherboard this thing is actually pretty nuts so we might as well talk about
[2960.92 → 2970.20] that uh our source is field gen e.g. edge wow that was an all right it's very clearly a capital j i think i
[2970.20 → 2974.92] would have said the same thing though just kind of like an e.g. just kind of goes happens yeah evil
[2974.92 → 2982.04] genius uh i mean oh dang all right I'm going to show you guys this it looks insane so i actually didn't
[2982.04 → 2986.36] know so okay the first thing i looked for as well where you're going to put all the 20 GPUs that it
[2986.36 → 2991.56] supports there's obviously not slots for it, but there are a bunch of USB slots i didn't know that you
[2991.56 → 2998.28] could still have that going over PCIE like that yeah that's cool, so the mining stuff has a little
[2998.28 → 3004.28] a little tiny card that you plug in that converts to USB normally so they're just
[3004.28 → 3009.08] skipping that step so you don't have to have the whole lane blocked out you just have all these USB
[3009.08 → 3013.56] plugs you don't have to worry about that step you still run an USB cable than that terminates back into
[3014.20 → 3019.56] another thing, and you're good to go that's pretty cool it's a sweet looking board pretty nuts
[3021.16 → 3027.32] crazy when's it coming out mining master i don't know it says in the notes i just don't I'm lost here
[3027.32 → 3030.52] let's scroll down i think i put on the bottom because i thought it was boring
[3031.96 → 3035.80] it's just it's just interesting its one of the most interesting looking boards I've ever seen
[3035.80 → 3040.12] that's why i wanted to talk about available in North America starting in q3 like even look at the
[3040.12 → 3052.28] power dude 24 pins 24 pins 24 pin 8 pin wow but does it have onboard Wi-Fi i don't know get out of here
[3052.28 → 3056.76] i did notice that they still had their uh can you guys see my mouse oh this one uh they still have
[3056.76 → 3063.48] the like sound divider just in case you want to listen to some jam hell of a sound card on you
[3065.08 → 3072.04] all the utmost oh man on your 20 GPU mining rig you just got to rock some ACDC you're just listening to
[3072.04 → 3081.40] white noise heck yeah okay are we good is that does that conclude the wan show oh my god it feels
[3081.40 → 3086.04] weird because i feel like i had two wan shows hmm like it feels like this wan show is really short
[3086.04 → 3089.72] so I'm like no I'm not done yet oh i see what you mean but like i think it actually
[3091.08 → 3097.08] yeah i think we're i think we're about good thank you for coming to the wan show the uh the multipart
[3097.08 → 3102.76] series oh Linus has screwed up his brand on this laptop but anyway this is your phone that is my
[3102.76 → 3112.04] phone is that a crack on the screen that is well see ya ah intro i forgot that last time there we go
[3112.92 → 3117.80] i was going to do the intro I'll tell you well it's the intro and the outro
[3117.80 → 3132.04] bad timing did you fart nope that's this chair you know i wasn't talking with the sound oh that sucks
[3133.00 → 3145.24] savage jerky savage spectrum honey oh it does kind of smell weird hey prime i believe it Jin yang
