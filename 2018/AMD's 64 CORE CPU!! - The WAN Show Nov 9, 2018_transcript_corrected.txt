[0.00 → 8.88] and we're live it's WAN showtime again welcome to the best show that takes place
[8.88 → 18.00] on Friday afternoon on this particular channel that's all that's yes I mean I
[18.00 → 21.36] wouldn't compare it to anything else because nothing else is really quite like
[21.36 → 28.12] the WAN show, so I have a special co-host this week and the story behind this is
[28.12 → 32.56] actually a good one, so Alex here has actually worked at Linus Media Group
[32.56 → 37.48] for the better part of almost like two years now is that right no yeah yeah
[37.48 → 43.78] pretty close Wow, so this will be your two-year like annual performance review
[43.78 → 49.24] coming up like next month yeah that's incredible so on his performance review
[49.24 → 53.74] will be a lot of good things like Alex has done a great job of our laptop content
[53.74 → 57.58] a lot of our more maker content he installed the single most dangerous
[57.58 → 63.34] thing in our entire studio a few weeks ago CNC you don't agree that's the most
[63.34 → 68.68] dangerous thing in our studio probably not okay what's more dangerous um other
[68.68 → 71.44] than Dennis with a power tool that doesn't count you don't get to just take
[71.44 → 75.10] Dennis plus something and create something more dangerous than the CNC
[75.10 → 79.38] because you could just have Dennis the CNC there was that time when the laptop
[79.38 → 84.94] cart the like AC power screwed up, and it was just like the whole laptop cart had AC
[84.94 → 90.70] power okay, but I'm talking present tense the most dangerous thing in our office
[90.70 → 99.18] that was pretty bad that was a bad scene anyway there's going to be lots of good
[99.18 → 103.94] things, but then we had him on to host an episode of tech linked a couple of weeks
[103.94 → 109.70] ago and um so actually we the first time he did it was a couple of months ago and I
[109.70 → 116.84] watched it, and I was like okay yeah like you kind of warmed up more towards the end, and you had your
[116.84 → 120.92] moments you had like some pretty brilliant moments like the intro I thought was great
[120.92 → 128.52] and I checked in I was like so you didn't realize the camera was on yet no slash didn't realize they were
[128.52 → 133.38] going to use it no I knew that you knew they were going to use it okay that's not what you said in
[133.38 → 140.40] our meeting anyway yeah well anyway the point is there were these moments of brilliance, and I was
[140.40 → 144.82] like okay there's potential here but you and I need to kind of meet about hosting style before
[144.82 → 151.54] before you do another one, and then we did, and then he was hosting another one and halfway through I was
[151.54 → 159.78] just like I think we're creating more pressure and more tension with me standing here and like
[159.78 → 165.48] trying to help you through this as opposed to helping so new plan you're going to help co-host the
[165.48 → 169.14] WAN show get a little bit more comfortable on camera, and we're going to go from there so we got a
[169.14 → 174.60] lot of great topics for you guys this week what do you get what's your top picks for topics um so
[174.60 → 182.68] AMD did really well yes oh, oh I didn't, and now I wish that I really didn't sorry what do you get
[182.68 → 191.12] um AMD they have 64 core epic processors you might say they're don't oh
[191.12 → 195.38] that's like two in a row that are brutal
[195.38 → 201.26] and oh I don't even see it here but there was more news about AMD that's just
[201.26 → 207.88] not great what news was that well they that's not embargoed is it that's not something like
[207.88 → 216.12] we're working on that you overheard like me and Anthony discussing is it um no oh okay as long as
[216.12 → 219.88] you can find an article that you can say throw that in the doc, and we'll pull it up later but the
[219.88 → 228.44] rumours around AMD's Radeon RX 590 don't look particularly promising what does look promising is Samsung's
[228.44 → 234.56] promise to unveil flexible display phones moving forward we'll be talking about that a little bit and
[234.56 → 239.32] uh this doesn't look promising this is actually just more annoying than anything else Apple is apparently
[239.32 → 245.46] blocking Linux installs on computers equipped with their latest T2 security check what are they trying to secure
[245.46 → 250.86] at this point okay sorry we'll discuss it in more detail later first the intro
[250.86 → 261.18] it sometimes works it's still just always a surprise though we really need to update it
[261.18 → 266.84] it's so old like this intro was created back when we sat on a couch
[266.84 → 269.70] yeah
[269.70 → 274.48] yeah we used to sit on a couch that looks just like that
[274.48 → 281.08] we even had like a little red cushion then that cushion and by the time we got rid of that couch
[281.08 → 287.82] it was disgusting because there would be times when we'd be hosting the WAN show on like a pretty
[287.82 → 294.08] warm afternoon um the old office didn't have air conditioning and like even this one being out here
[294.08 → 298.40] in the warehouse during the summer like it is didn't have air conditioning until the very end of the
[298.40 → 301.44] summer this year we actually never got to turn it on I don't think you know we have air conditioning
[301.44 → 306.22] out here now right oh I didn't know that yeah look there's one unit here and then there's one over on
[306.22 → 310.36] the other side uh the crappy air conditioning installers are the reason that our roof leaks
[310.36 → 316.74] right now oh I was kind of wondering what caused that yeah so you know fix one problem create another
[316.74 → 323.60] that's life for you right um so anyway that that cushion I would usually put it behind me because the
[323.60 → 330.32] Ikea couch that we bought for the WAN show was sort of like not really the right proportions for me
[330.32 → 336.20] like the cushions were just not comfortable for my okay I was being kind I was being kind so
[336.20 → 340.84] maybe they're not comfortable for anyone because Alex doesn't look like it right now because he's
[340.84 → 345.68] slouching a lot, and it's the chair maybe it's more in his legs, but he's a lot taller than me
[345.68 → 349.90] so if it doesn't work for me, and it doesn't work for you, it probably doesn't work for most people
[349.90 → 357.42] so I would always have this cushion behind me, and I'm a bit of a back sweater so that cushion was
[357.42 → 364.86] never washed and for literally years once a week I would soak back sweat into it so it had
[364.86 → 372.20] like this kind of you know that musky smell that like attracts the ladies' no not that kind of mask
[372.20 → 381.14] no the really gross mask um Luke's out this week for those of you who are asking thank you for asking
[381.14 → 387.42] let's appreciate let's appreciate new Luke because James is new Luke so you don't get to be
[387.42 → 392.28] new Luke you're like you can be new James except that I think you were hired at the same time
[392.28 → 400.40] um all right what topic do you want to jump into you want to talk about AMD's 64 core epic processors
[400.40 → 409.92] uh sure they're 64 cores seven nanometre awesome uh and this is why you were kicked off tech linked
[409.92 → 419.12] so AMD is really, really turning the what are they what are they called thumb screws yeah
[419.12 → 424.36] turning the thumb screws on intel that that's a torture device thumb screws no not that kind of
[424.36 → 430.16] thumb screws they just go in your case no, no thumb screws are a thing hold on a minute
[430.16 → 437.00] no, no we're going to use my screen to google it because okay thumb screws uh torture
[437.00 → 445.92] okay thumb screw torture thank you thumb screw there you go oh that looks horrible yeah I really
[445.92 → 451.18] don't want that on my thumbs so it's bad so you twist you put the thumbs in there is my understanding
[451.18 → 457.72] actually here this one looks pretty brutal and then you twist this thing a wing nut and it uh I
[457.72 → 464.08] think just like shatters the bones in your thumb um simple vice with protruding studs victims thumbs
[464.08 → 472.66] fingers or toes replaced in the vice and slowly crushed um so uh that's what AMD is doing to intel
[472.66 → 479.50] basically putting a lot of pressure on them right now to figure out how to respond to the onslaught
[479.50 → 485.32] because last year with the launch of their Ry zen processors and the launch of their epic processors
[485.32 → 495.78] AMD got competitive now it's starting to look a little more interesting it's not like it's not like
[495.78 → 502.42] watching an exciting horse race where you know which horse is going to win, but the other one is giving her the
[502.42 → 509.12] old college try this is like watching a race where sometimes horse one wins and sometimes horse two wins
[509.12 → 518.72] um so with zen 2 we are expecting to see IPC improvements to the desktop chips meanwhile intel
[518.72 → 524.20] hasn't managed to do anything other than bump core counts in the last couple of years and on the
[524.20 → 528.10] server side of things because remember this is where the big money is made this is where intel has
[528.10 → 534.50] products in their lineup that cost anywhere between two thousand to ten thousand dollars per chip and we
[534.50 → 540.28] talk about like expensive consumer CPUs like when you're reviewing a laptop and I say okay it's got a
[540.28 → 551.98] 500 or 500 HQ uh excuse me HK processor in it yeah you're going that's not a lot sometimes but in this
[551.98 → 559.60] a lot I think typically you would say that's expensive yeah okay I don't know it depends you usually whine
[559.60 → 566.36] about them well yeah, but that's not only because they're not cooled okay yes oh okay so in those
[566.36 → 572.16] cases you're paying the extra for it, and you aren't getting extra performance because they run really
[572.16 → 578.42] quite warm, and they end up throttling um but anyway so in the context of something like a 1500 laptop
[578.42 → 586.98] a 500 CPU is really expensive in the context of a server you know you could easily spend thousands of
[586.98 → 594.84] dollars on a CPU like they kind of start where the high-end consumer level chips end and the craziest
[594.84 → 604.66] thing about it is we're not talking you know Alex Clark and his one laptop and one desktop or Linus
[604.66 → 612.36] Sebastian his one laptop and handful of desktops we're talking gigantic data centres like what was that
[612.36 → 618.68] place you checked out how many CPUs did they have that um 6 000 at ligo right and so was that
[618.68 → 626.62] 6 000 CPUs or 6 000 boxes with two CPUs each um I don't remember exactly, but it was a bunch of
[626.62 → 633.34] blade servers that were set up with a bunch of eons in them like I think they had a bunch of 24 and 16
[633.34 → 640.48] core processors so in an installation like that yeah 24 and 16 core processors so in an installation like
[640.48 → 650.08] that all of a sudden AMD is now competitive in the lucrative data centre market and with epic
[650.08 → 658.32] I don't think anyone even AMD really expected their epic processors to come in and like immediately
[658.32 → 663.12] steal half of intel's market share because the reality of it is that the data centre market doesn't
[663.12 → 671.50] move that quickly the way that these products get validated is over a much longer period of time and
[671.50 → 677.58] the planning that goes on for these kinds of installations just means that even if AMD had
[677.58 → 685.44] the world's best supercomputer processor today it is unlikely you'd actually see the like an actual
[685.44 → 692.58] supercomputer built with them for another 12 18 or even 24 months that's the way that it works for
[692.58 → 699.86] those kinds of things so AMD got competitive when they launched epic and when they launched dozen
[699.86 → 709.62] now they're saying zen 3 and zen 4 are on track they demonstrated a 7 nanometre epic Rome codename Rome
[709.62 → 719.08] processor with 64 cores, and they've had some time for the industry to get used to the idea that they might
[719.08 → 727.36] want to plan on using AMD for these installations so you have to have the jab and the hook, so the first one was the jab
[727.36 → 733.24] hey by the way we're here pay attention to us this is the hey you've got us in the back of your mind hey guess what
[733.24 → 739.08] it gets even better boom 64 core processor oh by the way did we mention we're cheaper oh by the way did we mention
[739.08 → 744.52] that we support these massive amounts of memory oh by the way remember all those PCI Express lanes that we have and our
[744.52 → 750.42] competitor doesn't they're still there and then like I think that the real like Deadpool like crotch to the
[750.42 → 757.54] face is the fact that it's also infinitely scalable like they can just as intel would say just glue on
[757.54 → 764.64] the course and just keep on doing it there was such a there was such a jelly vibe from that jab from intel
[764.64 → 768.88] when they were talking about AMD gluing cores together yes okay technically gluing cores together
[768.88 → 775.10] is a more technical term than it sounds like, but it's still it just had this like it had this salty
[775.10 → 781.58] vibe to it that they were just like kind of petulant about it like well their core their CPUs aren't real
[781.58 → 787.96] because they're just they just got toothpicks and bottle caps and glue, and they put them together
[787.96 → 794.12] like that well they still are working pretty well so watch out in this context I think it makes a lot of
[794.12 → 800.72] sense because right now intel is also just like putting two CPUs on a board yeah so that was on
[800.72 → 809.28] just Monday that intel announced their 48 core Leon which appears to be two CPUs on like an on a
[809.28 → 813.56] substrate is that what it looked like or I think so yeah you'll have to it's not a ton of
[813.56 → 818.44] details in our notes I actually didn't look that closely at it because it requires a new socket
[818.44 → 826.64] um I think it has like 12 channel memory, but it's my understanding again don't quote me on this
[826.64 → 832.76] uh I might as well just look it up 48 core Leon, but my understanding is it has 12 channel memory in
[832.76 → 838.36] big quotes uh multi-chip package yeah here it is okay, so original article then is from a non-tech and
[838.36 → 845.40] I'm basically going to read it with you guys here scaling up to 48 cores per CPU oh no, no no oh what
[845.40 → 851.40] where did that mute button go oh wow, wow I'm sorry everyone there we go battlefield 5
[851.40 → 859.14] blah blah blah yep here we go typical oh no that's a four socket something or other okay two socket
[859.14 → 865.84] system until yeah here we go so yeah technically there's these 12 memory channels, but that's just
[865.84 → 870.66] because we are basically looking at two CPUs on a single package and then this is where it gets
[870.66 → 877.88] really crazy these things get a new socket that is going to have uh hold on oh wow current 24 core
[877.88 → 884.44] uh platinum runs at 205 watts we don't know what frequency they're going to run at 24 cores per die
[884.44 → 894.46] oh wow PCIE lanes oh wait okay so PCIE lanes anywhere between 48 24 per die or 96 48 per die which
[894.46 → 900.64] again would be identical to just running four CPUs in a quad socket board I'm trying to find
[900.64 → 910.02] the memory channels a bit just it's just nuts I wish I could find the socket server 12 DDR channel
[910.02 → 915.22] wow that ad played again as I scrolled back up whatever it doesn't really matter the point is this
[915.22 → 923.60] thing is edentulous and AMD instead of launching like a new platform so new socket new chipset weird CPUs
[923.60 → 929.58] that are like actually more literally glued together AMD is refreshing an existing socket
[929.58 → 936.32] which like I said in the data centre space in the enterprise space matters because these kinds of
[936.32 → 944.16] deployments take time to plan and just because they plan things over a long period of time doesn't mean
[944.16 → 950.18] that they can't leverage the most up-to-date components if the supplier has a roadmap that makes
[950.18 → 958.18] any sense so if AMD says okay look here's our epic platform I still kind of called it that here's our
[958.18 → 967.92] epic platform epic here's our epic platform here are the servers that are based on this oh hey we're a
[967.92 → 973.20] month from your deployment you haven't actually cut your PO yet by the way we just doubled the core
[973.20 → 977.80] count, or we have a higher frequency part that it's at the same price in the same TDP
[977.80 → 985.04] go ahead and chuck those in instead great whereas when you're rolling out an all new platform well
[985.04 → 991.08] that that throws a complete wrench you can't just swap that into a deployment it doesn't work that way
[991.08 → 999.00] so AMD looks to be firing on all cylinders right now and intel is still
[999.00 → 1006.14] yeah, and it's already on what Amazon Web Services and 10 percent cheaper than intel based solutions
[1006.14 → 1015.78] and while we're at it, I guess AMD announces the radon instinct which seems like it should be
[1015.78 → 1019.54] awesome but I think it's mostly for blockchain and cryptocurrency
[1019.54 → 1029.98] so the instinct mi60 and the mi50, so these are aimed at the enterprise accelerator market with AMD
[1029.98 → 1035.68] looking to significantly improve their performance competitiveness in everything from HPC to machine
[1035.68 → 1041.52] learning, so these would be the kinds of things that they would do at SFU's um super computers so
[1041.52 → 1047.94] researchers who are working on um oh man I forget what some of the examples of things that they were
[1047.94 → 1055.40] doing there were, but things like simulation um like processing gigantic data sets um those can be
[1055.40 → 1061.32] accelerated by GPU compute i what's the biology stuff that they do um sequencing
[1061.32 → 1067.82] yep that kind of thing uh I mean we're we're just kind of guessing that's just what that space does
[1067.82 → 1073.98] I don't know how much market share AMD actually gained with their initial instinct processors but
[1073.98 → 1081.20] these look like uh an improvement so they've got support for half rate double precision up from 1 16th rate
[1081.20 → 1087.18] so they've got uh, so this is especially useful for machine learning inferencing where high precision isn't necessary
[1087.18 → 1092.66] okay oh no they have new low precision data types that's useful for machine learning inferencing where
[1092.66 → 1096.90] high precision isn't necessary, and they're also able to get up to four times the performance
[1096.90 → 1104.50] of a fp16 data type when using the smallest in four days okay, okay so basically they've got some new
[1104.50 → 1114.96] some new modes that they operate in pretty much peak throughput of 7.4 teraflops fp64 14.7 fp32
[1114.96 → 1122.72] so okay neat yeah I mean this is the kind of thing that won't have a lot of relevance to you and me
[1122.72 → 1130.58] necessarily at least if the rumours on the street are to be believed with respect to AMD's consumer GPUs
[1130.58 → 1138.30] so the original article is from WCC f tech so we'll have to take it with the grain of salt that
[1138.30 → 1143.38] people seem to think we should take it with from my experience their rumour stuff isn't really any worse
[1143.38 → 1151.94] than anyone else's rumour stuff like is it I don't know um but apparently their third Polaris GPU revision
[1151.94 → 1160.44] is coming, and it's going to be called the Rx 590 so wow it looks like they've even gotten
[1160.44 → 1168.24] their hands on the AMD confidential NDA required under embargo until oh there's this thing there
[1168.24 → 1173.96] that says comments I can't see what's under embargo till but uh this looks like an official AMD slide deck
[1173.96 → 1179.90] um I don't even know why they bother having embargoes at this point
[1179.90 → 1187.20] well I don't even know why they bother calling it something new at this point making this GPU
[1187.20 → 1200.04] if is the rumours are true um it has um be based on 2304 cores compared to the Radeon RX 580s 200
[1200.04 → 1208.94] or 2304 cores yep so that's same number of course how much ram does it have eight gigabytes compared to
[1208.94 → 1219.40] the eight gigabytes okay the bus width is 556 bites compared to 556 okay and the name is 590 though
[1219.40 → 1224.42] that's that's a change that's a change that's an improvement, and it's slightly higher clocked
[1224.42 → 1232.36] okay so what we don't know right now because we can see on that main title slide um latest
[1232.36 → 1242.24] generation fine 12 that it could be going from 14 nanometers to 12 nanometre sort of because if it
[1242.24 → 1248.34] uses TSMC's 12 nanometre process that might actually be an improvement to power characteristics
[1248.34 → 1256.22] and performance if it uses global foundry's 12 nanometre that's actually based very closely
[1256.22 → 1263.50] like i it might even be a little disingenuous to call it 12 nanometers compared to the 14 nanometre
[1263.50 → 1273.58] process that AMD was already using on the Rx 580 so um do they have actually done they have leaked
[1273.58 → 1282.30] die sizes here at all uh no because that might tell us something interesting no they don't so what we
[1282.30 → 1287.28] don't know is if this 12 nanometre shrink is just giving us some better power efficiency actually do
[1287.28 → 1294.54] they have rated power draw no, no nothing leaked in power draw either so it's possible that
[1294.54 → 1301.30] these are just overclocked but I mean really this was all AMD could come up with uh to say to sell this
[1301.30 → 1308.44] thing latest generation fine 12 which quite frankly in my personal opinion should not be a selling
[1308.44 → 1317.36] feature that you put in front of a consumer does that seem fair yeah why does my cousin care what
[1317.36 → 1325.46] fine process you're using he's not going to what matters is how many fps how many dollars I pay
[1325.46 → 1333.80] what cool features it has liked you know um automatic you know gameplay recording or special antialiasing
[1333.80 → 1339.32] modes or whatever the case may be or drivers that work yeah how many finest it has doesn't matter
[1339.32 → 1346.52] okay selling point number two aggressive tuning for higher clocks so we already have that graphics card
[1346.52 → 1357.42] that's called the Rx 580 OC okay enhanced idle and multi-monitor efficiency that is a driver improvement
[1357.42 → 1366.96] and finally expanded options and robust partner designs so basically they're saying they're not
[1366.96 → 1374.40] making a reference card is that what that sounds like to you yeah because that's what that sounds
[1374.40 → 1382.32] like to me all right so I'm not impressed expected pricing is 250 to 300 us what was the 580 right around
[1382.32 → 1388.06] there I think they should just call it the 580 x, and then we would be like awesome they made a faster
[1388.06 → 1395.86] 580 good job guys instead of being like it's a 580, but now we're mad you know that is a perfect
[1395.86 → 1402.18] point, and it's actually not a video about an AMD product, but we do have a video coming up about a
[1402.18 → 1406.60] product that is currently embargoed so I can't say what it is unfortunately which is really frustrating
[1406.60 → 1412.80] because it would make this story more interesting, but basically we've got a product that we've got our
[1412.80 → 1422.12] hands on already, and we've been testing, and the manufacturer refused to disclose to us certain
[1422.12 → 1429.36] aspects of the specifications of the device and here's the stupid thing about it
[1429.36 → 1444.32] it makes me feel kind of disrespected yeah like we have it we have it in our hands, and we can measure
[1444.32 → 1453.80] these characteristics it's not particularly complicated to do so they're either disrespecting
[1453.80 → 1459.68] our competence because they don't think that if they don't tell us we'll be able to put two and two
[1459.68 → 1468.26] together here, or they are disrespecting our time because now we have to invest time to measure something
[1468.26 → 1476.60] that they could have simply provided on a spreadsheet, or they are disrespecting our thoroughness because
[1476.60 → 1483.40] they don't think that we're going to bother to talk about this like there's no way that I can slice
[1483.40 → 1489.88] this and feel respected maybe they're disrespecting our viewers that's another way because they don't
[1489.88 → 1496.02] seem to think that they need the full story so why make it any easier to get there like can you come up
[1496.02 → 1503.04] with a way that not providing some spec of your product is respectful to your partners because that's what
[1503.04 → 1512.60] the media are no I can't, and it's just it's just baffling and that's what i honestly that's what I feel
[1512.60 → 1519.60] like a lot of these kinds of skews um whether the 590 turns out to be what it looks like it might be
[1519.60 → 1527.16] which is just a rehash of the 580 but like maybe from a different supplier depending on what manufacturer
[1527.16 → 1531.92] they're using for the chips um and this other thing that I'm talking about it just like these
[1531.92 → 1538.82] rebrands it just feels like why even bother then why even seed us a unit why not just say outright
[1538.82 → 1544.00] we are trying to mislead the general consumer into thinking this is something new when it isn't
[1544.00 → 1549.62] actually do you think they're doing the 590 because they did the 580 whatever SP the
[1549.62 → 1557.02] they rebranded the 570 to be a 580 I really don't like what AMD is doing on their GPU side like i
[1557.02 → 1563.18] understand why they're doing it they're doing it because they got nothing it's like it's very obvious
[1563.18 → 1569.04] they just they got nothing and NVIDIA has new stuff that they are obviously planning to roll out
[1569.04 → 1574.70] and AMD's like well that's the way it works like when your competitor launches something you got to
[1574.70 → 1578.40] launch something so if we can't launch something new I guess we'll launch what we already got
[1578.40 → 1585.02] um and they already did that with the 580 but at least they called it something different
[1585.02 → 1589.18] no that's what they're doing again they're just calling it something different
[1589.18 → 1594.80] no the 580 did I okay my understanding is the 580 was a different die even though it was only
[1594.80 → 1604.64] slightly optimized okay so actually okay 480 all right 2304 590 same thing
[1604.64 → 1612.26] oh wait when is the last time AMD launched a new graphics card well they did Vega but
[1612.26 → 1620.34] yeah they don't exist really do they not like can you buy a Vega 56 on new egg like you couldn't
[1620.34 → 1626.18] during the whole mining thing like they were impossible to get but I don't really know why
[1626.18 → 1635.04] you would like you can get them in an iMac Pro yeah okay there's an rock there's an rock
[1635.04 → 1643.42] reference card on new egg uh there's a power colour mini that's pretty cool or NATO rather oh cool
[1643.42 → 1650.22] um okay yeah there's a handful of Vega 56 is in stock but then okay let's take a pretty well-known
[1650.22 → 1660.94] brand like SFX you could make the argument SFX is kind of too AMD what VGA is to NVIDIA at least you
[1660.94 → 1664.72] used to be able to they used to have like a lifetime warranty and stuff actually I don't think
[1664.72 → 1670.98] they do any more anyway let's take some brand SFX and let's try to buy 10 of these and let's update
[1670.98 → 1676.90] our cart um how do you update your cart update quantities, and it's looking like that you know
[1676.90 → 1682.42] what 70s are considerably cheaper they've got uh no they've got 10 in stock though so apparently
[1682.42 → 1689.24] no they've got okay new egg used to correct you like here let's see because there's no way
[1689.24 → 1695.42] they have like 50 of these things yeah okay they have 49 of these in stock so apparently they're
[1695.42 → 1701.54] actually selling all right maybe we didn't give Rx Vega enough credit, or maybe they have 49 in stock
[1701.54 → 1706.82] because they can't figure out how to get rid of them I don't know the point is I don't like what AMD
[1706.82 → 1711.92] is doing on the graphic side of things but uh at the end of the day as long as they're kicking ass
[1711.92 → 1718.06] on one side of the business then it seems like they can keep surviving because for a while there it was
[1718.06 → 1725.00] graphics that was keeping them alive, and they're like okay you guys just just please carry us
[1725.00 → 1730.30] deadweight CPU guys until we can until we can get zen out and then and then you can rest
[1730.30 → 1741.18] um all right okay so apple blocking Linux installs why would they do this yeah I just don't get it
[1741.18 → 1748.34] who cares like okay, so the source was Tito 463 on the forum the original article here is from the
[1748.34 → 1755.26] register okay walk us through this what is going on here I have no idea and I don't understand why it
[1755.26 → 1763.86] would happen so they're blocking Linux that's all that I know I really felt like this article was
[1763.86 → 1776.32] addressed to me personally and i um I realize now it's the other Linux oh yes it's like whoa what
[1776.32 → 1781.08] because I was actually like seriously considering the MacBook Air until I realized that it doesn't
[1781.08 → 1787.62] have the quad-core eighth gen processors which was I knowing to me um actually our MacBook Air is not
[1787.62 → 1791.80] going to arrive till Tuesday so you guys are going to have to wait for our content on the MacBook Air but
[1791.80 → 1797.16] I was so amped on this thing because I didn't watch the keynote or attend the event I just got
[1797.16 → 1802.06] excited because like apple was finally launching a new MacBook Air and I was like Alex because he
[1802.06 → 1806.60] wanted to do the review yeah I wanted it really bad because I thought the same thing and then I was
[1806.60 → 1811.04] like Alex I don't think you're going to get to do it because I think I might even use it as a daily
[1811.04 → 1816.40] driver like I'm going to boot camp it and I'm gonna you know what I'm going to give macOS a shot because
[1816.40 → 1822.32] I do every once in a while and um then he gets he replies to me, I think this is on the hangouts or
[1822.32 → 1828.76] something yeah it's just like it's a dual-core and I was like no, no no it's eighth gen sure eighth
[1828.76 → 1835.20] gen core i7 surely they have a quad-core option and no yeah we just found the stuff it's like why
[1835.20 → 1842.84] like everything like not this surface it's got all the thunderbolt ports, and it's all sexy and
[1842.84 → 1848.58] it's got the battery life it could have finally just been we could have finally had the laptop
[1848.58 → 1855.30] we're both waiting for because like you're on the surface laptop and here you know what this is
[1855.30 → 1864.04] awesome 30 second review of that go okay best keyboard best screen because it's 4x3 overall just
[1864.04 → 1869.38] generally awesome no thunderbolt sucks okay like I'm not plugged in right now because
[1869.38 → 1878.64] no, no way now can't do it right you'd need a display port to HDMI adapter okay here I go with
[1878.64 → 1884.96] the razor blade stealth pretty good build quality pretty good keyboard nice big trackpad could be
[1884.96 → 1894.02] bigger okay display it's fine I guess has thunderbolt so e GPU very nice mediocre battery
[1894.02 → 1900.24] life and I don't like the keyboard at all, and he doesn't like the keyboard at all so we're both
[1900.24 → 1907.06] kind of waiting for something to be perfect and people are probably yelling right now that the
[1907.06 → 1915.20] Dell XPS 13 has all of that but I just don't like it yeah I don't know like i just kind of open it up
[1915.20 → 1920.14] and the screen's tiny, and you can only get like the 4k one and then everything's really
[1920.14 → 1926.54] crammed, or you don't get touch and honestly 4k displays on a screen that size make no sense
[1926.54 → 1934.16] because once you start scaling windows like 250 percent stuff does look kind of stupid like i and i
[1934.16 → 1941.30] know that that's an aesthetic quibble and that's maybe not legitimate or whatever but either of us
[1941.30 → 1947.72] could use a XPS 13, and we don't so deal with it um oh people are saying the gram build quality's
[1947.72 → 1954.42] trash yeah well it's not trash not on all of them pretty good we don't like the 15 yeah but the 13
[1954.42 → 1959.76] doesn't have thunderbolt and the 13 doesn't have thunderbolt see this is a problem you know what
[1959.76 → 1965.36] though that new hp envy that new the x360 that we looked at in the writers meeting are we getting
[1965.36 → 1972.22] one I'm not sure okay tell you what let's just buy one if we can't get one all right okay so let's let's
[1972.22 → 1977.74] get one of those because do we agree that one looks promising it does yeah if the battery life is on point
[1977.74 → 1983.60] and the build quality i I have yet to encounter a hp laptop keyboard that has lit a fire in my soul
[1983.60 → 1989.38] though that's the one thing I'm really worried about because for better like for better or for worse
[1989.38 → 1996.28] you can make an amazing laptop you can make the perfect laptop and if it doesn't have a decent
[1996.28 → 2000.14] screen you will never sell it to either of the people sitting behind this desk right now
[2000.14 → 2005.70] did I say screen keyboard you did say screen yeah keyboard for me is the main thing keyboard
[2005.70 → 2012.48] is key and touch screen I can't just use like a non-touch screen anymore
[2012.48 → 2022.68] keyboard is key I was just trying to go past that come on I guess that the macBook doesn't
[2022.68 → 2030.86] have a touch screen, but yeah actually touch screen is kind of a big deal to me too all right like one
[2030.86 → 2036.54] thing that we do a lot that people probably don't know is the like Teleprompter like the ghetto
[2036.54 → 2042.78] one where you know right we'll be you're kind of reflecting but yeah so we'll literally be like
[2042.78 → 2048.20] on location somewhere where's the last place that you and I did together um I'm thinking of general
[2048.20 → 2054.38] fusion but I know we've done one since did we do that before or after the uh the trip down to SpaceX
[2054.38 → 2061.86] um I don't remember I think we had a prompter at SpaceX yeah we did yeah anyway CES um you know
[2061.86 → 2065.84] what we're going to have to get back to this because we haven't done our sponsors for the show yet oh goodness
[2065.84 → 2076.66] uh sponsor number one is being quiet oh wow um oh god um this is complicated so uh I'm just going to sit
[2076.66 → 2088.62] back hold on yeah sure this is ah the silent base 801 oh I just pulled the filter off the front no no
[2088.62 → 2094.58] wait you're going to hit the mic okay right there okay I'm going to put that filter back did I put it back
[2094.58 → 2099.04] right oh good okay cool you know I really like it's really back it's backwards so don't hit the
[2099.04 → 2104.46] mic don't hit the mic that will hurt everyone oh goodness dang it okay we're turning it the wrong
[2104.46 → 2108.54] way yeah I know right it's backwards okay tell you what here you take the side panel off
[2108.54 → 2119.28] okay this is okay this is really easy I swear when like Linus isn't holding it
[2119.28 → 2128.60] what are you doing okay let's try that let's try that again meanwhile be quiet's watching this they're
[2128.60 → 2135.56] just like really you guys there oh okay got your acoustic dampening stuff in there trust me it's in
[2135.56 → 2140.42] there I can't see that's fine anyway that's the back panel so you got your SSD mounts you got
[2140.42 → 2145.96] really nice built-in fan control which is awesome uh these are interesting but from the other side so
[2145.96 → 2150.98] you can kind of use them to route cables from over here or from the other side what's neat is that you
[2150.98 → 2155.98] can install all the three and a half inch hard drives you want or leave it completely blank it's
[2155.98 → 2161.04] totally up to you, so there's three SSD mounts back there um moving around to the front is this
[2161.04 → 2166.70] literally the case that we used for that build or is this the second one oh no different case
[2166.70 → 2171.54] oh okay the same case but the same one yeah okay so we actually have a build coming in this where
[2171.54 → 2177.08] we're going to do like the fastest gaming pc tempered glass side panel of course the year is 2018 you
[2177.08 → 2184.08] got to have that included pure wings fans I believe it's three of them yep two in the front one in the
[2184.08 → 2188.88] back uh you've also got these are those three and a half inch cages that you can install all up and
[2188.88 → 2194.70] down here um really nice clean basement here so you don't have to see here can you hold that for
[2194.70 → 2199.44] a second so you don't have to see your power supply wires or anything like that like it's really easy
[2199.44 → 2207.16] and really quick to do a nice clean build in it, I have no idea what be quiet's talking points were for
[2207.16 → 2213.78] this thing so you know we must have got them we probably missed a handful of them, but it is what it
[2213.78 → 2222.54] is at this point oh goodness and that was the last time be quiet ever worked with us FreshBooks
[2222.54 → 2227.98] FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than help you
[2227.98 → 2232.44] create and send slick looking invoices it helps you track your time with their timesheet function

[2253.80 → 2261.60] in how did you hear about us section and finally savage jerky oh yes sriracha teriyaki i was
[2261.60 → 2267.82] taking that no well okay hold on a second we've got reaper I'm going for the sriracha bacon
[2267.82 → 2276.20] all right what a wuss all right I'm going to have some sriracha teriyaki savage jerky it's made with high
[2276.20 → 2282.70] quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives their goal was to create a snack that was full of
[2282.70 → 2288.12] flavour and spice, but that isn't bad for you, they've got 13 different flavours of jerky like the sriracha
[2288.12 → 2293.64] bacon and maple buffalo bacon which is my personal favourite they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce
[2293.64 → 2298.08] and a spice rub I haven't actually tried the spice rub or the barbecue sauce but I've tried the hot
[2298.08 → 2303.46] sauce it is delicious and their Carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world
[2303.46 → 2304.80] the
[2304.80 → 2314.56] elephant weighing pepper just kidding it what Carolina reaper pepper obviously yeah anyway you can use
[2314.56 → 2319.04] offer code Linus to save 10 on all their products' no it's not made of elephant weighing pepper no but
[2319.04 → 2325.06] i just kind of want to try it now it's hot have you never tried it I think that I did, and it was
[2325.06 → 2331.80] unpleasant yeah it's not like it tasted perfect, but it was like oh it's it burns it's burning
[2331.80 → 2339.26] like it burns not just when you pee you know like just burns yeah it doesn't actually burn there
[2339.26 → 2345.30] I tried it before and I was like wow that was really great and then like 20 seconds later I was just
[2345.30 → 2352.62] like but I don't know let's just do it again all right, so this is in my mouth
[2352.62 → 2355.74] mm-hmm not too bad yet did you put the whole thing in yeah
[2355.74 → 2362.42] all right well stay tuned for the sweat breaking out on his brow over the course of the next time no
[2362.42 → 2369.58] you don't get to take your drink already all right so right now it's pleasant but like we're
[2369.58 → 2375.74] getting there back to apple blocking Linux install so their t2 security chip is blocking Linux from
[2375.74 → 2382.26] booting on Mac devices and the t2 security chip the way it was sold to us anyway is supposed to be about
[2382.26 → 2388.36] encrypting your data so that if someone steals your device so if someone steals your device they can't get
[2388.36 → 2395.50] at it um, but instead it looks like the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that both come with the t2 chip
[2395.50 → 2407.38] embedded are going to yes okay whatever so the latest iMac Pro the latest MacBook Pro so the new
[2407.38 → 2412.34] MacBook Air the Mac mini any of the devices that apple makes that come with the t2 chip embedded
[2412.34 → 2417.52] they're going to have a secure enclave they're going to have APFS storage encryption touch id handling
[2417.52 → 2424.28] a hardware microphone disconnect on lid clothes and other security features but the t2 chip also
[2424.28 → 2432.16] restricts the boot process, and it means that Linux support on Mac hardware is now not just bad or
[2432.16 → 2440.24] inconvenient it is non-existent by default even windows isn't bootable until you enable support
[2440.24 → 2446.84] for windows via the boot camp assistant on macOS wow so what this will do is install the windows
[2446.84 → 2451.96] production ca 2011 certificate that's used to authenticate Microsoft bootloaders, but it doesn't
[2451.96 → 2456.04] set up the Microsoft approved UEFI certificate that allows verification of code by Microsoft partners
[2456.04 → 2461.42] so even when the secure boot functionality has been disabled the t2 chip is reportedly still blocking
[2461.42 → 2464.60] operating systems aside from macOS and Windows 10 specifically
[2464.60 → 2473.64] I really like this headline that they have here where it's just t2 more like terminator 2 is this a
[2473.64 → 2474.12] register
[2474.12 → 2484.36] but like I know so many programmers that use macBooks and macBook airs all the time and all of them use
[2484.36 → 2489.80] Linux on it like they never use macOS or like sometimes they do but a lot of them just use Linux so I have
[2489.80 → 2498.68] no clue why they would do this I mean there's the obvious sort of snarky argument well why are you
[2498.68 → 2504.12] buying a macBook if you don't want to run macOS and I can come up with some pretty easy answers to
[2504.12 → 2511.48] that maybe you don't want to run macOS all the time, and also they're just doing your laptops also
[2511.48 → 2516.68] they're just pretty nice hardware and here's another thing like people complain a lot about the repair
[2516.68 → 2521.24] ability of Apple hardware, and it is a legitimate complaint we've run into that problem ourselves
[2522.44 → 2529.48] however for better or for worse because of the ubiquity of Apple hardware even though it's very
[2529.48 → 2536.60] difficult to repair finding someone who has gone to the effort of figuring out how to repair it can
[2536.60 → 2541.24] actually be easier in some cases do you get what I mean by this and finding spare parts is really easy
[2541.24 → 2547.24] too like stuff like power connectors even if it's soldered you can like to find a dead one really easy
[2547.24 → 2553.72] and then just pew and like we mean really easy and of course a relative sense yeah like my friends in
[2553.72 → 2559.08] engineering would make a good buck off of if it's still hard, and it's still a hassle and apple could
[2559.08 → 2568.60] still support third-party um like service providers a lot better or at all but at least these third-party
[2568.60 → 2573.56] service providers keep fighting through and keep finding a way although the t2 chip looks like it
[2573.56 → 2575.16] really might kibosh a lot of this
[2577.96 → 2585.32] all right um U.S. internet traffic routed through China for two plus years yeah we don't have a lot
[2585.32 → 2590.92] of time left so yeah and I don't really want to talk about that too much until it's confirmed yeah and
[2590.92 → 2595.48] I was like what was the other thing some of these are some of these topics are kind of like duh like
[2595.48 → 2600.20] teal ghost posted this on the forum google confirms that dark mode saves battery on android
[2600.20 → 2607.08] really like you think anyway the good news is we're finally getting dark mode um Samsung is also
[2607.08 → 2612.92] planning to add it with their new one UI which is sounds good I hope I don't know when Samsung
[2612.92 → 2618.04] announces they're doing a new android skin it's like will they make it better will they bung it up
[2619.16 → 2623.24] will they finally fix my battery drain issue i had it again the other day, and now it's
[2623.24 → 2629.72] now it's fixed again so actually small iOS just really annoying thing you can turn the keyboard
[2629.72 → 2634.92] dark but then the area below the keyboard still stays light so it just looks horrible and I can't
[2634.92 → 2640.36] deal with it oh yeah you've been using iOS for a little while how's that going I don't like it at all
[2641.32 → 2646.92] there's just like a couple small things that like I got through the like the initial like not liking it
[2646.92 → 2650.52] because I just didn't know how to use it okay have you found some of the beautiful things though
[2651.40 → 2656.52] like being able to reposition your cursor with uh 3d touch or force touch or whatever they call it
[2656.52 → 2660.44] on the phone no how do you use that it's really because I've been really annoyed with like copying
[2660.44 → 2663.08] links yeah so do you have your phone on you yes
[2667.16 → 2673.64] this is one of those like I forget how I lived without it every time I go back to the iPhone um
[2674.36 → 2679.88] so here let's just like type itty type some stuff and if you want to reposition your cursor
[2681.08 → 2690.28] oh neat huh I had no clue how to do that yeah, so apple does a perfect job of some little quality
[2690.28 → 2696.28] of life things and I'm at the point now where I think a lot of people assumed from my iPhone 10s video
[2696.28 → 2701.48] that I hated the iPhone or hated the 10s I don't I don't hate it I just don't care about if it's just not
[2701.48 → 2707.88] interesting um and quite frankly for me there are things that drive me nuts about both sides like my
[2707.88 → 2712.28] Google Pixel 3 excel review is not going to be particularly positive either and I think I'm just
[2712.28 → 2718.92] jaded and tired of phones and so that's why I'm not going to be our main writer for phone videos
[2718.92 → 2724.04] anymore because I think I just can't handle it anymore so I'm still going to be like senior editor
[2724.04 → 2729.80] but I'm like one of our better received phone videos over the last little while the rogue phone
[2729.80 → 2737.72] was actually 95 prepared by Jake not by me so there you go take that for what it is I just want to like
[2737.72 → 2743.16] whinge about a couple more things sure go for it is that the 10s or the yeah yeah that's the 10s right
[2743.16 → 2751.16] so I can't put all of my icons down on the bottom so like you, you only get four I want five yes in
[2751.16 → 2756.20] order to search something I need to go all the way over to the left no no no search is good yeah
[2756.20 → 2762.60] here I can fix that for you so you search just by swiping down anywhere no, but you still you swipe
[2762.60 → 2769.88] down then you have to click on it no it's no it autopopulated look I can type see I didn't have to
[2769.88 → 2774.92] click it okay so okay they do have some stupid stuff like that though where you'll like I think it's um
[2775.72 → 2780.12] when you look up a contact or something I think you have to actually click the stupid text field before
[2780.12 → 2786.12] you can start no, but you get to it and now I need to click search web, and then it opens on safari yeah
[2786.12 → 2790.84] yeah, yeah okay, okay okay whereas like on the pixel you just go over it searches your whole phone
[2790.84 → 2795.80] and the web you know it's funny I'm so old it's just right at the bottom like on my other phone
[2795.80 → 2803.00] it's right here I'm so old-fashioned that whenever I want to google search I open chrome and then start
[2803.00 → 2810.84] typing I literally have maybe twice in my life used even though on a lot of my phones it's just there
[2810.84 → 2817.08] by default and I just forget it I just like can't even see it that google bar that's on my home screen
[2817.08 → 2822.84] i just don't even use it because I'm old and stupid okay it's kind of like Jake saw me well but
[2822.84 → 2829.24] like I've had that search bar on my phone on the home screen since I had a Samsung s2
[2830.68 → 2835.88] so like how have you not gotten used to it since then Jake it's just I'm just old I'm just old and
[2835.88 → 2840.84] stupid so Jake saw me trying to pay for something with my credit card with tap the other day and i
[2840.84 → 2848.52] took my whole card and I like put it down on the reader, and he's like wow you're so old and I'm like
[2848.52 → 2854.60] what, and he's like well the antenna is right there so you only have to go against it like this
[2854.60 → 2860.60] and I'm like okay like yeah I never gave any thought to where the to where the actual NFC or
[2860.60 → 2866.04] excuse me RFID element was inside the card and if I had, i would have known that yes I only have to put
[2866.04 → 2873.48] like I'm not an idiot I know how RFID works but i just never thought about it because I'm old and i just
[2873.48 → 2878.28] i always just put it against it, and it always just worked so what do I care so I always put it
[2878.28 → 2881.48] against it because I did that for a little bit where it's like the end because i kind of felt
[2881.48 → 2888.20] cool but it sometimes just it bugs out and I find if you do the whole thing it works more of the time
[2888.20 → 2892.52] well there you go I feel validated right now speaking of validation we should probably validate
[2892.52 → 2898.28] some of our super chat um oh goodness people because we haven't yet and that's really terrible
[2900.44 → 2903.32] um I can't read it's me sad face this highline is keep up the good work
[2903.32 → 2909.72] Dave says love LTT would love to see that you team up with retro RGB for a retro gaming video
[2909.72 → 2914.76] interesting we do have some retro stuff planned so stay tuned for that dark inertia hi
[2916.44 → 2923.48] showdown channel super fun video budget gave us five euros believe it or not channel super fun is
[2923.48 → 2932.36] still fully funded people are excuse me I'm just eating my jerky hungry um people internally are
[2932.36 → 2937.88] allowed to shoot channel super fun if they can find time to do it they're allowed to spend the entire
[2937.88 → 2942.60] AdSense income from channel super fun on channel super fun which means that over the last six months
[2942.60 → 2947.72] where we've done basically nothing there's literally thousands of dollars in a bucket that people could
[2947.72 → 2954.20] just spend doing cool stuff if they wanted to okay but I'm just not pushing it that's all do you know
[2954.20 → 2960.12] what I really want to do acetylene powered potato cannon I know you want to do that but that I think
[2960.12 → 2964.92] is not a particularly amazing idea so they also have no do you realize how dangerous acetylene is
[2964.92 → 2971.00] and how great it is in a potato cannon I built one of these before, and we had to like to wrap it in duct tape
[2971.00 → 2976.68] because it kind of exploded, and then it like really exploded it was really great
[2980.12 → 2990.36] Zach carter says it's my birthday happy birthday love your quality content in quotes thank you Zach
[2991.32 → 2998.20] simplexes says instead of buying a better CPU I would buy an OS made for gaming cutting out the crap
[2998.20 → 3002.52] unfortunately that doesn't really exist believe it or not cutting the crap out of your OS doesn't
[3002.52 → 3008.36] really do much for gaming um in fact we still need to do that follow-up on Windows game mode
[3009.32 → 3016.28] oh yeah we should do that um laggy says hi Linus love your videos will there be a kg rig reboot 2019
[3016.28 → 3023.08] oh wow I don't know we haven't even finished 2018 yet yes, thank you Colton that's the plan um
[3023.08 → 3032.36] um evil says where's lucky someone moved him over to 101 uh so I plan to move him back but I had put
[3032.36 → 3037.96] him in the set there and then yeah i think it was Brandon I think Brandon got rid of him
[3040.68 → 3045.08] it's not a waste of 20 minutes of your time if you don't spend 20 minutes moving him Brandon
[3045.08 → 3051.88] if you just leave him in his home I think it would have been really great in my way I need the space
[3053.00 → 3056.84] no but just think about how great it would have been for this razor video to just have him in the
[3056.84 → 3063.48] background right just chilling there you know Christian says I've watched your content for five
[3063.48 → 3066.36] plus years never fails to entertain me awesome
[3068.84 → 3074.04] Neil says want to show my support thanks Neil oh wow there's so many of these leggy tech is back again
[3074.60 → 3078.28] oh man laggy tech I'm sorry it was just because I wasn't looking at them, yet it wasn't that I like
[3078.28 → 3083.08] wasn't going to read your comment I mean sometimes that is it but sending more probably won't help
[3083.96 → 3092.44] um see euros would I notice any latency going from a TN to IPS for gaming so we actually have a video
[3092.44 → 3098.20] coming soon that's not really about that um actually yeah it's really not about that at all
[3098.20 → 3106.68] I don't know I personally can notice the difference, but it's like that's if I have them side by side like
[3106.68 → 3114.76] a 144 TN beside a 144 IPS you'll notice yeah but a lot of the time I'll just be like oh that IPS is
[3114.76 → 3120.04] just way better I find the IPS advantages more noticeable than the TN advantages but I can certainly
[3120.04 → 3126.44] see like if you're like we've got a 240 hertz TN from Asus in the office here and like in CS go
[3128.28 → 3135.96] like whipping around you can still see detail in like it's amazing on a wall in dust 2
[3136.60 → 3142.44] and it's its incredible but i would take IPS over that every time by the way this guy also says
[3142.44 → 3148.76] BT dubs Alex you're a wonderful addition to the oh why thank you kudos to you Linus is okay too I guess
[3150.36 → 3157.64] uh Katja keep up the good work thank you um Minna desk says don't forget they're not going to make
[3157.64 → 3161.96] a 1080 ti anymore I actually didn't know that that kind of makes sense it's just kind of unfortunate
[3161.96 → 3166.92] what do you want to come but also whatever we're reading super chats oh perfect here you go what is
[3166.92 → 3172.20] this oh folding yes folding's great oh yeah okay people should fold its folding month so in
[3172.20 → 3178.44] support of fighting diseases and things we're going to give away three GPUs this month a 1080 and
[3178.44 → 3186.44] 21070s and to win the 210 all you have to do is fold on our team leg.GG slash folding for more
[3186.44 → 3194.28] information do it are you providing these GPUs yeah just pulling them out of my butt yeah okay goodbye
[3194.28 → 3200.28] I hope you at least like put them in a plastic Maggie first no plastic bag no plastic bag that must have hurt
[3200.28 → 3205.48] yeah those are like the VGA ones too, and they're like kind of their pretty Buddy
[3207.16 → 3213.72] um and KOI says the jerky can get spicy here's a beer on me joke's on joke's on you, I keep the five
[3213.72 → 3219.40] dollars he has to pay for his own beer, and also it really wasn't that bad I remember it being a lot
[3219.40 → 3226.52] worse really okay yeah I think I sweat a bit but like hello world from Hong Kong says ken
[3228.04 → 3233.56] and I think we're pretty much good nice all right, so thanks guys for tuning into when show we
[3233.56 → 3237.48] will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel maybe different bat hosts
[3238.68 → 3243.00] we'll see I don't know how do you think Alex did let me know in the comments below or in the chat one of
[3243.00 → 3247.64] one of these if you think he was terrible you can also let me know if you thought he was good
[3248.68 → 3253.32] or just Linus's puns were terrible the whole time no thumbs down for that pump no puns were
[3253.96 → 3260.92] oh so we uh we talked to YouTube's um i forget who they were, but thumbs down is apparently
[3260.92 → 3266.44] worse for your uh algorithmic relevance than we thought oh so we might stop encouraging people to
[3266.44 → 3280.44] thumbs down the video so okay we'll see how that goes comment yeah that Linus was horrible
