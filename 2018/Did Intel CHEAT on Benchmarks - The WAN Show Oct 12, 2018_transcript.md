[0.00 --> 8.70]  and we're live it's gonna be a oh boy it's gonna be a short WAN show today you know what I was
[8.70 --> 17.42]  doing today no I was installing a soundbar that took you all day well I was installing a soundbar
[17.42 --> 23.80]  with Alex oh and have you ever tried to achieve something with Alex actually I don't think so
[23.80 --> 30.66]  it usually involves a drill okay okay that makes sense I could see that so did you guys go like
[30.66 --> 36.36]  way over and above actually no no the soundbar was not not crazy janky or anything like that the more
[36.36 --> 41.66]  fun thing that we did is I don't know if when you rolled into the office today you noticed that
[41.66 --> 49.68]  the super civic kind of moved I heard you yesterday um okay it was loud yeah so the float plane team had
[49.68 --> 56.32]  a little viewing session through the window yeah so we were working yesterday on what I think may be
[56.32 --> 65.74]  the greatest video that Linus Media Group really has ever created wow so basically what happened was um
[65.74 --> 73.10]  a particular projector brand yeah reached out um wanting us to do a sponsored video on a projector
[73.10 --> 81.58]  okay and the writing team having learned our lesson from the uh the fiasco that was the how nerds
[81.58 --> 88.74]  watch sports ball video really put their heads together to try to come up with a concept that
[88.74 --> 96.28]  wouldn't get us completely as the kids say wrecked in the youtube comments okay and we came up with this
[96.28 --> 106.10]  one won't look we came up with the idea because here's the thing about projectors yeah projectors
[106.10 --> 113.18]  are really good at one thing a big picture in a dark room I thought you're gonna say projecting light
[113.18 --> 122.96]  but okay yeah projecting a big light picture in a dark room yeah and they are super mediocre at best
[122.96 --> 131.54]  at everything else yeah and so when you're trying to come up with a unique spin on a projector
[131.54 --> 136.08]  it's like coming up with you know I was about to say it's like coming up with a unique spin on socks
[136.08 --> 141.00]  but actually coming up with a unique spin on socks is pretty easy you can put them on your feet you can
[141.00 --> 145.88]  put them on your hands and go like this you can wear sandals on top of them like there's all kinds
[145.88 --> 149.92]  of different ways legitimately use them as gloves if you really need lots of different ways to enjoy socks
[149.92 --> 156.72]  yeah projector best enjoyed from the couch with popcorn in a dark room with a projector screen
[156.72 --> 161.12]  and we've had it like disproportionately high amount of like brands that make projectors
[161.12 --> 163.14]  approach us about making unique content
[163.14 --> 170.76]  so you pretty much name it we've kind of done it and yeah we only really like to review projectors
[170.76 --> 175.82]  like a when it's not sponsored because we don't like to cross our streams there as the as the kids
[175.82 --> 182.14]  say you never cross streams yeah um but we don't we don't really like to review them when there isn't
[182.14 --> 190.10]  something really different technologically about them so when I see a 4k 120 hertz projector that has
[190.10 --> 198.30]  like some kind of like superhuman dlp wheel that spins faster than any dlp wheel ever spun before um then
[198.30 --> 203.62]  then that'll probably merit a review okay just like what we did with uh dell has a really unique
[203.62 --> 211.14]  projector it's a 4k laser projector that's a super short throw so you put it like 12 18 inches from
[211.14 --> 216.04]  the wall and you've got this gigantic really sharp image because it's laser and stuff cool yeah sort of
[216.04 --> 220.84]  it's like hybrid laser there's a dlp wheel involved if I recall correctly anyway the point is it was
[220.84 --> 228.06]  really different so we did a review of that um so the one that we were working on for this it was it was
[228.06 --> 233.98]  different in the sense that it's higher brightness compared to most projectors of this type which is
[233.98 --> 238.06]  great because higher brightness means you don't have to have quite such a dark room in order to have
[238.06 --> 244.66]  a good viewing experience but it wasn't like fundamentally different technologically so we
[244.66 --> 250.38]  weren't going to be doing a review of it and so we were like we were like okay you know so far we've
[250.38 --> 257.40]  upgraded our boardroom we've installed a projector in my children's bed like that was that was pretty out
[257.40 --> 262.28]  there which actually they love by the way I took it down recently because we changed the layout of
[262.28 --> 269.12]  their room but they actually love having that up there it's pretty cool um and we thought you know
[269.12 --> 275.42]  what we haven't really seen a lot of in the last you know couple decades drive-in theaters
[275.42 --> 285.44]  the drive-in theater is kind of you know like a lost you know art form I know of one yeah so only one
[285.44 --> 295.76]  then we thought what if we took the drive-in theater concept on the road that's why it's okay okay
[295.76 --> 304.38]  so you guys are gonna have to watch the video but let me put it this way we organized a meetup
[304.38 --> 313.32]  for like like an experience a viewing experience party of the portable drive-in theater machine
[313.32 --> 319.20]  and four people showed up I was gonna ask how many people showed up
[319.20 --> 326.30]  five if you count the guy who owns the field oh my goodness and uh what did you guys play can I ask
[326.30 --> 332.36]  hilarity hilarity ensued we ended up playing rocket league um rick asked we's never gonna give you up
[332.36 --> 339.40]  okay and um some of some of uh brandon's beautiful footage from oh okay yeah yeah yeah
[339.40 --> 344.84]  honestly rocket league on a mobile setup off the front of a car actually sounds super cool
[344.84 --> 349.14]  so you're playing with controllers anyway so you kind of sit wherever and I will tell you this
[349.14 --> 353.42]  it was cold last night and I was very happy to have a warm hood to sit on
[353.42 --> 359.68]  so I'm sitting there in the middle of a field right it's so premium sitting there in the middle of a
[359.68 --> 365.06]  field with a controller with this gigantic like it's a 200 inch screen or something 17 feet whatever
[365.06 --> 372.98]  that works out to 17 foot we actually purchased yes we bought it we purchased I had no idea we spent
[372.98 --> 380.32]  200 of linus media group's hard-earned money so everyone's sending super chats today um you guys
[380.32 --> 386.74]  are are making up for the gigantic inflatable projector screen that we bought apparently
[386.74 --> 395.98]  um well not yet not making up for it yet um yeah we got we got we got a $10 super chat thank you thank
[395.98 --> 402.18]  you for that uh hellcat thank you hellcat uh oh right we should probably get into like some topics for the
[402.18 --> 406.62]  day uh we got a lot of great topics for you guys there was the made by google hardware event
[406.62 --> 413.78]  there was also the made by razor hardware event um I I actually have my hands on the pixel 3
[413.78 --> 419.76]  boom right there uh the pixel 3 xl uh I've actually been spending most of my time with the xl so far
[419.76 --> 423.98]  and I'm gonna go back to it I'm just I'm having a weird issue with it where it's not getting hangouts
[423.98 --> 429.12]  notifications so I popped my sim in this one so that I could see if it was just isolated to that
[429.12 --> 434.64]  other unit and it does appear to be isolated to the other unit so I'm gonna have to figure out what
[434.64 --> 438.50]  the crap is going on maybe just reformat and see what happens yeah not only do I not get a
[438.50 --> 446.42]  notification but if I open up I unlock the phone open the hangouts app I still won't get a notification
[446.42 --> 452.80]  until I happen to open a conversation thread with a person who sent me a message in the time since I
[452.80 --> 457.72]  got my last notification and then it will spam me with every hangouts notification I got from anyone
[457.72 --> 463.74]  else in the meantime oh geez yeah it's like hilariously broken oh yeah never seen anything
[463.74 --> 470.50]  quite like it yeah I'm trying to refrain I'm so interested because this is gen one and is starting
[470.50 --> 478.82]  to really show its age and I'm in like looking for a new phone territory um but that one's really small
[478.82 --> 485.80]  and the other one's notch is very ugly yeah it's like shock do you remember not that long ago yeah we
[485.80 --> 492.40]  had a poll about like what influences your smartphone purchasing decisions right no I don't remember
[492.40 --> 498.22]  but go ahead we had one on when we had a straw poll and like we we talked about how like yeah probably
[498.22 --> 504.04]  more people have have design influences than they realize and just yet a lot of phones just look really
[504.04 --> 508.96]  similar so it's not a big deal blah blah blah I didn't realize how much that notch might influence me
[508.96 --> 516.44]  wow there's a picture Yvonne posted on Twitter yeah you and Yvonne on the couch the notch from far
[516.44 --> 525.22]  away is really obvious what the heck and like pull that out I've seen I've seen an iPhone XS and it's
[525.22 --> 531.06]  notch and it's doesn't seem that annoying to me but this like giant I call it a fedora on Twitter this
[531.06 --> 537.38]  giant blocky thing in the middle of your phone is just so weird yeah you can see it from here
[537.38 --> 545.64]  there we go what the heck yeah so that's us on the couch and that's the notch on my phone
[545.64 --> 554.46]  like it looks like there's a huge dent in the top of your phone yeah wow yeah I don't know that's
[554.46 --> 561.38]  kind of that's a lot like I don't know have you seen the pictures of the notch delete um where they
[561.38 --> 565.98]  black out the notch area and then they put your notification and stuff on just a black bar so it looks
[565.98 --> 570.40]  like there's no notch because there's just a big black bar no I haven't seen that yeah but between
[570.40 --> 577.26]  that and the gigantic chin bar that they're only sort of gesture based navigation gives you it feels
[577.26 --> 584.84]  like going back to like an HTC One M7 yeah honestly like in terms of the forehead and like chin experience
[584.84 --> 589.84]  that I'm having using that phone so what what I know your reviews not for a bit and you always like
[589.84 --> 596.70]  spending more time with phones but if you had to give like a short-term preliminary opinions um
[596.70 --> 602.32]  hold on a second I actually didn't watch their keynote yet I'll like watch it later okay um so I
[602.32 --> 610.18]  don't know the price how much is the pixel 3x I believe it's 102 less than the iPhone um holy crap
[610.18 --> 615.16]  so it's Canadian oh that's Canadian okay so hold on a minute so what like $7.99 or something I believe
[615.16 --> 621.24]  is $7.99 okay I'm just gonna change this uh Americans we were supposed to be going through
[621.24 --> 626.74]  the topics for this today but I guess we're just getting a little bit sidetracked here uh phones
[626.74 --> 640.60]  oh and that's probably for 64 gig okay so here we go so $7.99 um yeah so um ah it's hard because
[640.60 --> 651.28]  yeah it's really early on it's uh here I always I always lose track of pricing um because I'm Canadian
[651.28 --> 657.94]  and so I I buy things in Canadian rupees but then I I try to speak in American dollars because the
[657.94 --> 666.26]  majority of our viewers are American um so I I always forget when I'm comparing pricing um yeah yeah I
[666.26 --> 671.06]  actually know that's true not the majority of our viewers are American we actually have a ton from
[671.06 --> 678.60]  the UK now yeah that really took off in the last like couple of years um here we go all right so I'm
[678.60 --> 682.30]  just finding out how much a Note 9 is brand new yes remember my choice how many times do I have to
[682.30 --> 688.98]  tell it yeah that's a lot of clicks to figure this out yeah it's a really bad experience okay so $9.99
[688.98 --> 695.98]  so it's a $200 difference to a Note 9 if Samsung had a commitment to support their devices with timely
[695.98 --> 703.66]  updates for three to four years like Apple does yeah then my answer would be very simple buy a Note 9
[703.66 --> 716.80]  or failing that an S9 plus um because I just yeah I just don't I don't know and there's other wild
[716.80 --> 724.62]  cards in there right now too so I actually have the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL um normally these days I
[724.62 --> 731.30]  review the the the the mini and the max version of phones together I've been doing it for that way for I
[731.30 --> 736.54]  think a couple years now yeah um but I'm reviewing these two separately oh because they are completely
[736.54 --> 743.58]  different phones just like the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL were in the sense that like every phone is very
[743.58 --> 750.22]  samey these days these two are as different from each other as any other phone is from any other phone as far as
[750.22 --> 756.36]  I'm concerned in terms of their design in terms of the the experience of using them they have things
[756.36 --> 762.80]  in common but in that same way an iPhone and other more different iPhone have a lot of things in common
[762.80 --> 767.76]  but they're different phones just to be clear all of the hardware is the same right I'm pretty sure all
[767.76 --> 771.60]  the cameras are the same I think the CPU is the same I think the RAM is the same as far as I know but
[771.60 --> 776.50]  what I don't know based on because I haven't tested it yet is based on the size of the chassis I don't
[776.50 --> 780.48]  know if the performance is going to be the same especially in things like gaming because of
[780.48 --> 785.48]  thermals okay and you know modern modern devices a battery is another big one and modern devices are
[785.48 --> 790.36]  designed to thermal throttle basically it's just a matter of what the manufacturer's tolerance was
[790.36 --> 795.60]  for how much thermal throttling they want when they want it to kick in how they're balancing uh surface skin
[795.60 --> 801.16]  temperatures versus the temperatures of the processors inside like they're really different devices so
[801.16 --> 808.98]  pixel 3 pixel 3 excel razor gaming phone 2 asus rog phone yeah the poco phone f1 that's just off the
[808.98 --> 813.58]  top of my head those are the phone reviews that I still have to work on right now so I I have a lot
[813.58 --> 818.50]  of work to do and the poco phone f1 is a really interesting one because that one's only 299
[818.50 --> 827.16]  and while the custom rom sort of scene has kind of died down a little bit since um since samsung in
[827.16 --> 833.50]  particular fixed touch whiz with the move to samsung experience yeah um it's kind of popping up again
[833.50 --> 840.38]  around that phone oh yeah the oneplus 6t is coming um isn't there a company that essentially it's not
[840.38 --> 844.58]  called cyanogen anymore but isn't there a company that picked up the cyanogen project that I'm not
[844.58 --> 848.80]  sure I heard about this I'm just not yeah I'm not sure about that one but I'm not worried about that
[848.80 --> 854.24]  anyway the poco phone f1 um the community is kind of springing up around that phone because the skin on it
[854.24 --> 859.46]  is terrible like I have the same kinds of issues that I did the last time I reviewed a xiaomi phone
[859.46 --> 866.76]  like they're just not well optimized for the north american user period and much worse things than
[866.76 --> 871.78]  just like you have to install netflix manually using an apk rather than through the play store like
[871.78 --> 874.64]  it'll just be like it's not compatible with your device and you go what what do you mean it's not
[874.64 --> 879.06]  compatible with my device it's ridiculous of course it is it's snapdragon 845 it's the same damn phone as
[879.06 --> 886.60]  every other phone it's just with a different you know shiny face on the front um so so where was I
[886.60 --> 892.40]  going with this right so because the software experience is so bad but the hardware is like
[892.40 --> 899.44]  banging for the price it is similar hardware to a top tier samsung or top tier google phone
[899.44 --> 905.88]  except a crappier camera right for 300 and the reality of it is not everybody cares about their
[905.88 --> 911.60]  smartphone's camera that much yeah so it's very compelling so anyway that's a video that I've been
[911.60 --> 919.68]  kind of been working on for a while but I've decided not to review with the stock skin so I have never
[919.68 --> 928.54]  done that before I actually intended with the mi mix interesting to s I think it was uh I think it was
[928.54 --> 935.28]  the mi mix 2 it was it was one of them it was a xiaomi phone but I had intended to go ahead because I got
[935.28 --> 941.70]  like a a chinese version of it and I had wanted to install like uh um like a more stock android
[941.70 --> 946.34]  experience type rom like I had wanted to go through the whole like unlocking the bootloader maybe it
[946.34 --> 950.26]  wasn't stock android experience maybe I just had had bought a chinese one and then I wanted to put a
[950.26 --> 955.20]  us rom on it and that wasn't supported yet but then while I was in the process of working on all this
[955.20 --> 960.26]  nonsense they released a us or like a global version of it and I was like okay well that work was all for
[960.26 --> 971.00]  nothing anyway um so I have never actually gone to the lengths that of of installing a different
[971.00 --> 979.10]  skin like a different rom on a phone prior to reviewing it but for me the Pocophone f1 is a unique
[979.10 --> 984.94]  sounds yeah case yeah because it's unusable with the stock skin in my opinion and if you can add
[984.94 --> 992.18]  a very significant amount of value yes that makes like to the point where people should be doing
[992.18 --> 997.68]  that if they buy this device I think of any kind of mod as how much I'm paying myself to do the work
[997.68 --> 1006.36]  yeah and if I'm paying myself three dollars an hour to install like to to you know hack a game console or
[1006.36 --> 1011.10]  something you know where there's realistically six exclusives I wanted to play for that console
[1011.10 --> 1016.54]  anyway and I could have bought them all for two hundred dollars and this is like a a 30 hour mod
[1016.54 --> 1020.84]  or something stupid like that yeah that might brick your thing that I'm gonna run out and I'm gonna
[1020.84 --> 1028.86]  have to get a new soldering iron for because I need like a you know like a high um like a high heat uh
[1028.86 --> 1034.38]  shoot what's that like a high mass like I need like a high mass soldering iron to make sure that I
[1034.38 --> 1038.70]  can hit this high temperature without affecting this other nearby chip or like whatever whatever if
[1038.70 --> 1042.44]  there's like all these hoops I'm jumping through and I go no this is stupid I'm just gonna go buy
[1042.44 --> 1048.56]  the games whereas if it's if it's a if it's a different type of mod like if it's a four hour mod
[1048.56 --> 1056.76]  and I can get you know 200 or 300 dollars of value out of it I'm paying myself 50 60 65 dollars an hour
[1056.76 --> 1062.66]  well then I look at it as something that I could reasonably recommend to a viewer yeah and it's worth
[1062.66 --> 1067.60]  the effort for me of going through and documenting this process and laying it out for people so
[1067.60 --> 1074.46]  so that's why I want to do it that way um people were pointing out to me after I googled it but
[1074.46 --> 1079.92]  thanks guys uh that it's called lineage os apparently like new continuation so it might
[1079.92 --> 1084.04]  be interesting to look into honestly something that's kept me from samsung for a long time I
[1084.04 --> 1088.54]  know there's been a lot of interest in the note 9 uh but something that's like strongly kept me from
[1088.54 --> 1095.40]  samsung is yeah I hate using their it's better now it's a lot better now by the way that weird
[1095.40 --> 1101.04]  hangouts glitch that you saw where I got where my my always on display had luke's message from an
[1101.04 --> 1106.52]  hour ago was because I got a different notification from tyler that he's purging the fridge right now
[1106.52 --> 1110.58]  you were talking about that earlier in the stream and I just saw it happen live I was like what that's
[1110.58 --> 1115.20]  a different bug oh my other bug is way worse okay it's I just won't get a notification at all
[1115.20 --> 1120.32]  and what I would have to do is I would have to go and I would have to go into hangouts and I would
[1120.32 --> 1126.04]  have to open like oh no your chat and then all these other ones would ping me at the same time
[1126.90 --> 1132.60]  really stupid super annoying and the thing is like I I was talking to uh our dbrand contact just
[1132.60 --> 1137.66]  like we were just chatting um over twitter the other night and I was like yeah I'm having these
[1137.66 --> 1142.82]  issues with the pixel 3xl and he's like lol it's what you get for using hangouts and I'm like okay
[1142.82 --> 1147.64]  look no he's giving he's giving me a hard time because he's like that who was this sorry uh
[1147.64 --> 1152.12]  rd brand contact who I don't think his name is public I'm not sure so I'm not saying his name
[1152.12 --> 1160.34]  but um but he's like lol you use hangouts that's what you get and I was like okay point taken but
[1160.34 --> 1168.08]  hangouts is part of the g suite yeah which is an actual for business product that I actually pay for
[1168.08 --> 1175.36]  and it is a google service that is inexcusable and he's like lol yeah no I know man I'm just I'm just
[1175.36 --> 1179.62]  razzing you but I get I get kind of triggered when people give me a hard time about hangouts because
[1179.62 --> 1186.48]  I know it's not popular and I I know it has its issues it works pretty good it's I don't think it
[1186.48 --> 1194.42]  works yeah it has it definitely has its limitations it has its limitations yeah but it is cross-platform
[1194.42 --> 1200.34]  yeah and especially for just like getting a singular person's attention for one like quick kind of thing
[1200.34 --> 1205.74]  I think it's really good for that yeah um it's once you start getting into big team chats and stuff
[1205.74 --> 1209.96]  I think you start running into no pretty heavy limitations then you start getting into slack or
[1209.96 --> 1216.54]  discord land yeah and like that's fine but the thing about hangouts too is that because all of our work
[1216.54 --> 1223.40]  accounts are google I I have a guarantee that if someone is just by logging into their email
[1223.40 --> 1229.70]  they are getting hangouts messages yeah at some point and it's all in one place there are benefits to it
[1229.70 --> 1235.42]  um and it's really frustrating for me because this google service that I pay for and this google
[1235.42 --> 1243.52]  device that I'm using shouldn't be completely unworkable together that's really ridiculous yeah
[1243.52 --> 1249.02]  it's like when back in the day when like a brand's power supply wouldn't fit very well in their own case
[1249.02 --> 1255.94]  yes guys what are you doing what uh and tech and tech was like exactly who I was talking about notorious for
[1255.94 --> 1261.22]  that and like honestly it's probably better now because they had a bit of a dark time there for a
[1261.22 --> 1266.12]  bit and I say dark time because I'm talking specifically about the dark fleet lineup of their
[1266.12 --> 1274.48]  case it's dark time um because they just had as far as I could tell no idea what they were doing
[1274.48 --> 1285.28]  the df85 was probably the worst designed case of its time I'm serious and they came out of like such a
[1285.28 --> 1292.16]  strong era I'm serious right now so df85 let's bring let's bring this mess up this thing was just
[1292.16 --> 1298.34]  unbelievably bad uh images I made a video about it like way back in the day this first of all that's
[1298.34 --> 1306.92]  what it looked like that was never cool it's not cool now it wasn't cool then it's bad it was always
[1306.92 --> 1315.70]  bad now let's go ahead and enjoy the interior design of this I hope the case is hot garbage um
[1315.70 --> 1323.80]  so remembering that this was only like six years ago when already no one was putting optical drives
[1323.80 --> 1331.94]  certainly not three and who ever put like eight three and a half inch drive except hold on it gets
[1331.94 --> 1336.12]  worse because you couldn't actually fit that many three and a half inch drives because they had these
[1336.12 --> 1344.40]  ginormous caddies that were basically adapting whatever this was to three and a half inch drive bays
[1344.40 --> 1350.94]  and then this was this was during the era of the gtx 480 so it had like all this cooling which seems
[1350.94 --> 1357.86]  great in theory the thing has seven 120 millimeter fan slots which is amazing except that this stupid
[1357.86 --> 1364.50]  caddy interfered with like standard length nvidia graphics cards so you could only install like one
[1364.50 --> 1371.50]  it was just so bad and get this see this thing right here this is like a five and a quarter inch bay
[1371.50 --> 1378.16]  cover except that it just has a little plastic clip right here that just like clips in here and then you
[1378.16 --> 1382.04]  could actually reach the button of your optical drive you could press the button but then the drive
[1382.04 --> 1385.92]  would pop out and it wouldn't actually open this thing it would just get jammed up against it and
[1385.92 --> 1391.02]  just like open and close a couple of times because it's confused it's like uh there's a there's a
[1391.02 --> 1395.70]  blockage uh and there was no there was literally no room for cable management so you see this cut out
[1395.70 --> 1403.06]  for the cpu cooler the amount of space back there is negligible almost none this thing was a complete
[1403.06 --> 1409.18]  cluster to build in because these video cards barely fit the cables had to be just like piled
[1409.18 --> 1415.70]  up down here getting in the way of all this airflow and like collecting dust it was just oh man so bad
[1415.70 --> 1421.18]  and was this the one that had that stupid two and a half inch dock in the top of it and remember this
[1421.18 --> 1427.64]  is those were horrible this is at a time when an ssd is like worth its weight in gold yeah right this is
[1427.64 --> 1432.38]  like six seven years ago current into the top so you're just gonna yeah you're just gonna and it
[1432.38 --> 1437.60]  was supposed to be like a gaming case like take it to a land party you can put your ssd in the top for
[1437.60 --> 1443.92]  your land party and i'm like are you nuts people take locking cases to land parties so that they don't
[1443.92 --> 1449.76]  get their graphics card ripped out they're gonna put their ssd right on the top in a convenient little
[1449.76 --> 1456.52]  dock we can just rip it right out are you kidding me and who had an ssd for anything other than their os
[1456.52 --> 1462.82]  why would you want that in a conveniently removable dock you know it would be kind of an actually
[1462.82 --> 1468.62]  pretty cool series of videos yeah sure retro rants i'm calm i'm calm i'm relaxed right now i'm chill
[1468.62 --> 1470.42]  you'd have to be not calm though
[1470.42 --> 1480.80]  it's like my my apple watch is like breathe breathe can you start breathing is it giving you health
[1480.80 --> 1490.02]  notices no it started taking dictation oh apple watch my apple watch why was it why was it i don't
[1490.02 --> 1497.08]  know what is it even doing i love how useless my watch is right now the apple watch is really
[1497.08 --> 1502.62]  interesting so it still doesn't have an always on display which is ridiculous um when you get a
[1502.62 --> 1508.80]  notification if you close it it doesn't show notifications that you got in your like history
[1508.80 --> 1515.02]  wheel they're just not there so that's really smart and so because uh we did that video earlier
[1515.02 --> 1522.08]  this week where we intentionally put one of my calendars online yeah yeah yeah it's like actually
[1522.08 --> 1532.02]  useless because it's just completely full of spam oh from justin3 regret all life decisions um channel
[1532.02 --> 1539.04]  super fun meeting hire nikki v back drop expensive stuff reopen linus's sex that got truncated
[1539.04 --> 1547.90]  survive the earth um 26 events got for tomorrow phone call with linus from one week in the past
[1547.90 --> 1554.28]  fire at colton fire colton both fire him and fire at him i've got another fire colton buy apples for
[1554.28 --> 1562.56]  tomorrow drop something test fire alarm as loud as possible burn all linus's sandals thanks night
[1562.56 --> 1570.24]  blood so i'm just you should probably de-link that again so people are probably what yeah i will at
[1570.24 --> 1573.98]  some point so people are probably wondering why i'm wearing an apple watch while i'm working on my
[1573.98 --> 1580.54]  pixel 3x i mean it's not doing anything anyway i'm just using it to tell the time uh so twitch chat
[1580.54 --> 1586.76]  loves the retro rants segment by the way i bet they do i bet uh youtube chat does as well um you
[1586.76 --> 1592.70]  know what they probably also love speaking of things they love our sponsors for the web show
[1592.70 --> 1600.40]  heck yeah sponsor number one honey head over to join honey.com slash linus you probably heard us
[1600.40 --> 1604.50]  talk about it before but honey is the free shopping tool that helps you find the best promo codes
[1604.50 --> 1609.52]  whenever you shop online at specific sites those of you who downloaded honey from our link have
[1609.52 --> 1614.92]  already saved over a hundred thousand dollars in the past few months just pretty nuts if you don't

[1651.62 --> 1659.34]  less than you would probably think most of my impulse purchases are tech and most of those well they
[1659.34 --> 1664.86]  get purchased through work so i don't actually do it that makes sense yeah um so you can get honey
[1664.86 --> 1669.52]  for free right now at join honey.com slash linus we're gonna have that linked well we have that linked
[1669.52 --> 1674.00]  right there you know what's good for me with honey yes was i had it when buying gifts last christmas
[1674.00 --> 1682.52]  oh so i just every time i buy a gift for christmas just give honey a shot it's gonna it's gonna like one
[1682.52 --> 1687.08]  thing about it is it's gonna be like i've got like 15 codes i don't know if one of these is gonna work
[1687.08 --> 1693.68]  but i'll try them and you just tell it to go for it and if it fails it's like well there you go and
[1693.68 --> 1698.44]  if it works it's like hey i saved you this much money takes like a couple seconds it's great you
[1698.44 --> 1702.80]  know what else takes a couple seconds signing up for private internet access pia hides your true ip
[1702.80 --> 1706.38]  address and allows you to bypass your restrictions and censorship by making you appear as though you're
[1706.38 --> 1711.56]  connecting from somewhere else and you can use it on five devices at once i'm not endorsing the use
[1711.56 --> 1716.86]  case where you and your entire family only has one account but i only have one account
[1716.86 --> 1721.66]  for me and my whole family it's great um it also helps prevent attacks by blocking unwanted
[1721.66 --> 1725.76]  connections it auto blocks all traffic if the vpn disconnects and keeps your data out of the hands
[1725.76 --> 1731.22]  of advertisers and other activity tracking snoops pia is affordable and they have over 3 000 servers
[1731.22 --> 1735.84]  in 28 countries and they don't log user activity so what are you waiting for check them out at
[1735.84 --> 1741.18]  privateinternet.com pages slash linus dash tech dash tips we need a better vanity url for those guys
[1741.18 --> 1748.36]  yeah and finally we could probably get linus tech tips.com slash vpn working oh yeah that'd be
[1748.36 --> 1752.94]  kind of cool yeah that would be like just direct people like they're fine and stuff well i think
[1752.94 --> 1758.18]  no i think they want the vanity url on their side so they can track it otherwise they just have to
[1758.18 --> 1764.12]  take our word for it and we're honest but like i mean it would just link over oh yeah that could work
[1764.12 --> 1770.36]  oh yeah we should just do that yeah we should get like our own shortener yeah i know jake knows how
[1770.36 --> 1773.30]  to set it up i think it takes like 10 minutes or something like that if you know what you're doing
[1773.30 --> 1778.60]  yeah anyway freshbooks yeah uh freshbooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually
[1778.60 --> 1782.36]  does a lot more than help you create and send slick looking invoices it helps you track your time
[1782.36 --> 1788.12]  manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what including a feature that shows you when your
[1788.12 --> 1792.14]  clients look at your invoice for the first time their mobile app has all the functionality of their
[1792.14 --> 1796.14]  desktop version so you can take freshbooks with you wherever you go and if you have any trouble
[1796.14 --> 1801.00]  you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real human no phone tree no
[1801.00 --> 1806.36]  escalations no return calls just answers it is eerie when you call a company like freshbooks or ting
[1806.36 --> 1809.72]  and you call them and someone's like hi what can i help you with
[1809.72 --> 1816.28]  learn it with fire there's supposed to be a tree yeah why am i not talking to a computer go visit
[1816.28 --> 1822.04]  freshbooks.com slash when if you're any kind of freelancer or you work for yourself it is worth giving it a
[1822.04 --> 1829.44]  tribe 30 days is free uh just enter when and how did you hear about us section all right should we do
[1829.44 --> 1833.98]  an actual tech topic should we do the intro now just to troll people what can i do for you nick
[1833.98 --> 1838.82]  usually when he comes down here during the show it's terrible news oh no this is fine i just it's
[1838.82 --> 1842.10]  funny that you said should we do an actual tech topic because i was literally just gonna say
[1842.10 --> 1846.98]  should we shill even harder by turning on youtube memberships right now because it's like finally
[1846.98 --> 1852.10]  turning on youtube memberships yeah you can you can turn it on right now if you want sure so
[1852.10 --> 1856.18]  actually it's probably worth actually it's probably worth talking to you guys about this because
[1856.18 --> 1864.60]  i feel like we're sending somewhat mixed messages right now there are no fewer than three different
[1864.60 --> 1872.24]  ways that you can send a monthly contribution to linus media group you can subscribe on twitch
[1872.24 --> 1881.00]  you can subscribe on floatplane or as of one minute from now you can use youtube memberships
[1881.00 --> 1886.54]  to subscribe man that's confusing terminology you missed one on youtube did i miss one hold on hold
[1886.54 --> 1892.98]  on let me think let me think let me think okay is he gonna get it twitch youtube oh yes you can
[1892.98 --> 1898.72]  contribute on the forum yeah so i had that bundled in with floatplane because technically most of the
[1898.72 --> 1904.42]  forum contributors are contributing like four four four players yes but yes we actually do have a
[1904.42 --> 1909.86]  significant number of even like gold level contributors who are amazing like actually it
[1909.86 --> 1915.86]  works out pretty well because the forum is one of those weird side projects that never really panned out
[1915.86 --> 1921.06]  in terms of being a money-making endeavor yeah but because of the contributors on the forum our costs
[1921.06 --> 1927.16]  for running the servers for the forum and even like a little bit of man time to make sure that it
[1927.16 --> 1933.80]  doesn't completely fall apart it's mostly mortis it's covered thank you mortis so um team yeah it's
[1933.80 --> 1938.28]  we have an amazing team over there and not just an amazing team there's a reason i call it out in
[1938.28 --> 1943.98]  almost every video that we do it's a great community over there so um but it's like it's
[1943.98 --> 1951.20]  self-sufficient now um which is which is because of the contributors there um so in terms of like actual
[1951.20 --> 1958.08]  linus media group like the videos stuff i still consider there to be three yeah yeah um brandon
[1958.08 --> 1963.14]  sent me a message that said do not reply no he didn't that was actually nick but hangouts notifications
[1963.14 --> 1970.72]  are f'd in the a um what nothing oh am i not allowed to say that is that not like a little spicy
[1970.72 --> 1980.92]  you think so all right yeah so here's how this works we have never really sold subscribing on twitch
[1980.92 --> 1988.90]  no because we think that's a bad idea yeah um we have a 50 50 rev share with twitch which means that
[1988.90 --> 1994.76]  twitch is basically just taking half of your five dollars every month so that you can watch literally
[1994.76 --> 2001.54]  one live stream a week for like roughly an hour for yeah rough not even always a full hour
[2001.54 --> 2008.00]  so we we've never really pitched that as a good idea yeah and then vessel came someone who's subscribed
[2008.00 --> 2011.96]  to twitch right now just oh no in capital letters
[2011.96 --> 2020.78]  minus say it isn't true says rc mehel i think that's the same guy who said oh no yeah okay
[2020.78 --> 2027.56]  oh and then there's trap giving out gift subs he's done 61 in this channel alone traps kind of
[2027.56 --> 2034.72]  a beast um so so anyway you know thanks to you guys but like it's really never been like uh you
[2034.72 --> 2039.64]  know something that keeps the lights on at linus media group yeah subscriptions yeah so then vessel came
[2039.64 --> 2047.08]  along and do not reply from brandon because i haven't cleared that notification so mad so mad
[2047.08 --> 2051.54]  getting so triggered right now i just need to like mute this thing and like put it away and stop
[2051.54 --> 2061.44]  looking at it um so then vessel came along and then died and um and then we and then died and then
[2061.44 --> 2067.40]  we created float plane which as you guys know luke is coo and basically does all the things over
[2067.40 --> 2073.46]  there he runs that runs that ship or a plane or whatever it is vessel oh excuse me uh it's a plane
[2073.46 --> 2080.60]  um so he runs that and the way that flow plane works is that flow plane takes a cut but one that
[2080.60 --> 2085.06]  is actually smaller than what twitch takes believe it or not and then linus media group takes a cut
[2085.06 --> 2091.50]  um after the payments cut is subtracted yeah does that all make sense to everyone yeah um okay
[2091.50 --> 2098.92]  then which is still better than the way that uh youtube works is youtube takes a cut and linus
[2098.92 --> 2104.60]  media group takes a cut so this is going to be the story we're going to have the feature enabled
[2104.60 --> 2111.72]  because the reality of it is there are going to be people out there lots of them that want to support
[2111.72 --> 2116.92]  linus tech tips or tech quickie or channel super fun or whatever content stream it is that they enjoy
[2116.92 --> 2123.34]  and have no interest in going off platform in registering a separate credit card now that
[2123.34 --> 2128.82]  they've already set it up for super chatting over on bitwit or tech deals or something on youtube they
[2128.82 --> 2133.82]  they just they want to stay in the google ecosystem because they can't be arsed to go sign up for some
[2133.82 --> 2138.94]  other third-party service there are always going to be those people so for those people we are enabling
[2138.94 --> 2145.68]  that for the people who are willing to go off site we are still going to be supporting floatplane
[2145.68 --> 2152.94]  100 and floatplane is still going to be the platform that gets early access video yeah and we have worked
[2152.94 --> 2159.96]  out a deal with youtube where it's cool if we have early access video on our own owned and operated
[2159.96 --> 2166.56]  site that we're going to maintain and we don't have that for youtube subscribers and if people like like
[2166.56 --> 2172.80]  want to subscribe on youtube then cool that's great if they want to support us that's great we appreciate
[2172.80 --> 2181.24]  that but early access is floatplane and floatplane is had actually has reached some really cool milestones
[2181.24 --> 2188.00]  internally lately and you can expect to see more options than just three dollars for one week early
[2188.00 --> 2195.98]  access at 1080p yeah um the the the technically the newest hire guy is building uh some cool tools for
[2195.98 --> 2201.10]  that and there's a lot of other things that are coming through the pipeline right now um that are
[2201.10 --> 2205.10]  that are going to be fun and new while we're at this do you want to just pimp the other position
[2205.10 --> 2211.84]  you're trying to hire again yeah let's do it um there's a form that is going to be can i uh give
[2211.84 --> 2216.02]  me a second i'm going to post it in twitch chat right now sure while you're doing that actually i
[2216.02 --> 2220.98]  might as well show what's uh what's really access on floatplane right now so we have a tech quickie on
[2220.98 --> 2226.78]  cable management oh actually i have a master account so i can see everyone so tech deals has uh
[2226.78 --> 2232.74]  ask tech deals number 14 q a best support nvme is it worth it uh we've got oh lordy
[2232.74 --> 2241.92]  six editors one cpu um part two out of question marks it's been a it's been a rough time uh bitwit
[2241.92 --> 2248.94]  has hotline 2.0 pre-water cooling build final course specs reveal uh tech deals another q a uh linus
[2248.94 --> 2256.74]  tech tips the hundred dollar vertical mouse this thing's wonko man um we've got uh this oh this is
[2256.74 --> 2261.58]  we we put um tech linked up there but it's like it's not early access because it's a news show
[2261.58 --> 2268.16]  um here let's just okay there's a lot of bitwit stuff a lot of tech deal stuff uh so six editors
[2268.16 --> 2274.46]  one cpu yep uh part one of two and then part two of question mark that gives you guys some idea of
[2274.46 --> 2279.76]  how that whole thing went uh tech quickie why is wi-fi slower than ethernet uh we've got we bought
[2279.76 --> 2285.50]  a cheap ssd on ali express that's actually even more interesting than you might think cool uh we've got
[2285.50 --> 2291.56]  this keyboard that raised three hundred thousand dollars on indiegogo and is frankly effing terrible
[2291.56 --> 2297.58]  to put it to put it bluntly yeah i'm not surprised yeah no the azio retro classic is really nice oh okay
[2297.58 --> 2303.08]  yeah no this thing the rhyme key whatever this is raised three hundred thousand dollars on indiegogo
[2303.08 --> 2311.00]  it's terrible um what else do we have in here we've actually done a fair number of simultaneous
[2311.00 --> 2318.80]  releases lately but we definitely have what am i looking for is that it this was fun i think it's
[2318.80 --> 2324.26]  on both now but yeah this one just came out anyway so we've got early access stuff over there that's
[2324.26 --> 2331.28]  going to continue to be happening um okay should we do a news topic i feel like i've talked about the
[2331.28 --> 2337.00]  pixel three a lot so oh okay all right here we go so this was posted on the forum but oh never mind
[2337.00 --> 2340.44]  there's just a business insider source it doesn't matter the point is i'm gonna quickly go over my
[2340.44 --> 2345.72]  thing um yeah right basically hiring an infrastructure guy there's more details in the google forums link
[2345.72 --> 2353.24]  in the twitch chat i'll post it on can i post it on youtube this is my that's fine uh i can't
[2353.24 --> 2356.86]  are you just logged into your personal account no it's a web address oh and you can't do that
[2356.86 --> 2361.92]  not the master can anyways uh it'll be in the description later so check it out there hiring
[2361.92 --> 2367.64]  someone to help with the infrastructure side of things um and there's a huge massive questionnaire
[2367.64 --> 2372.80]  that's like do you have experience with this if so how much and then that repeated like a whole bunch
[2372.80 --> 2377.76]  of times um and basically we're just trying to get a picture of like how familiar you are with some
[2377.76 --> 2383.08]  of the stuff that we've used i've had some people be like you should allow like short answered stuff i
[2383.08 --> 2390.02]  mean if you have zero years of experience with everything that we're using um if you're if
[2390.02 --> 2397.14]  you're able to move local great if you're not if you have tons of experience well maybe but like it's
[2397.14 --> 2404.62]  we have good responses already so so i'm not trying to discourage you just yeah saying um okay pixel
[2404.62 --> 2409.34]  three after this form i do an email out then you send me resume stuff we do it that way sounds good
[2409.34 --> 2418.74]  what is happening all right are you tired okay of every year oh boy whether it's google or apple or
[2418.74 --> 2426.98]  samsung yeah are you tired of every year them putting some shiny new feature in your face that
[2426.98 --> 2433.36]  just sounds so amazing it's almost unbelievable when they still haven't figured out basic stuff
[2433.36 --> 2438.98]  what are we talking about nvidia no we're talking about the pixel 3 right now okay so they've got this
[2438.98 --> 2442.98]  call screen feature that lets a robot answer the phone for you and transcribes the dialogue on your
[2442.98 --> 2446.94]  lock screen that sounds pretty cool do you remember that thing they talked about last year where your
[2446.94 --> 2450.62]  like google assistant could make appointments for you it could like call the hair salon and make an
[2450.62 --> 2455.06]  appointment was that last year that was last year it was pixel 2 if i recall correctly whoa okay
[2455.06 --> 2460.70]  do you remember that ai camera that stupid thing what was that thing called i don't remember that
[2460.70 --> 2464.86]  stupid ai camera that was gonna just like automatically take great pictures or whatever
[2464.86 --> 2471.96]  i don't know what i'm thinking there okay apple wireless charging last night when i got home i realized
[2471.96 --> 2478.90]  that i had left the key to the super lambo in the ignition okay okay so i walk in my door at home
[2478.90 --> 2485.30]  and i'm like i pull out my shiny new pixel 3xl and i say hey google it goes oh your internet's not
[2485.30 --> 2489.02]  working i go are you effing kidding me my internet is working i browse to a web page
[2489.02 --> 2495.64]  yeah it's working just fine hey google your internet's not working like i'll turn off my wi-fi
[2495.64 --> 2502.80]  okay cellular data good we got my internet working because whatever hey google remind me tomorrow when
[2502.80 --> 2511.50]  i get to work to take the key out of the civic okay i've set your reminder it's an 8 a.m reminder
[2511.50 --> 2517.52]  that has so that has nothing to do with the time that i i'm normally like barely even awake at 8 a.m
[2517.52 --> 2526.30]  let alone at work um it gives me no prompt to change it alter it in any way and then i go oh oh
[2526.30 --> 2529.48]  crap uh okay google show me my reminders
[2529.48 --> 2536.78]  and that's the first time it managed to pick that up that's great
[2536.78 --> 2546.38]  so i go okay google show me my reminders it not only doesn't show me my my reminders page
[2546.38 --> 2553.78]  yeah it reads me only my next reminder which is a reminder to go check on my daughter and take
[2553.78 --> 2557.24]  her fingers out of her mouth if she's sucking on them because it's making her teeth wonky okay
[2557.24 --> 2559.88]  and i'm sitting here going
[2559.88 --> 2564.84]  this assistant
[2564.84 --> 2569.32]  is expected to make appointments for me
[2569.32 --> 2580.30]  it can barely do basic stuff like fundamental stuff so here's here's my here's my unsolicited
[2580.30 --> 2586.90]  advice for the google assistant team get your shit together don't make new things improve what you
[2586.90 --> 2594.32]  have stop making new things yeah all together for like a year okay or two i would give them two
[2594.32 --> 2602.52]  go back and and and look at like some of the very frequently requested stuff that you haven't been
[2602.52 --> 2608.26]  able to help with or that people because i know you collect data about when someone sets a reminder
[2608.26 --> 2614.10]  and then they go in and they change it manually after like when you got it wrong go look at that
[2614.10 --> 2616.60]  stuff because that is way more important
[2616.60 --> 2618.70]  way more important
[2618.70 --> 2625.64]  okay that's all i have to say about the google hardware event uh let's let's move on to uh this
[2625.64 --> 2632.44]  was posted by carclis on the forum and it's the intel ninth gen benchmarking scandal boom so why don't
[2632.44 --> 2637.24]  we go through why don't we go through the series of events uh yeah we're almost done give me five minutes
[2637.24 --> 2641.18]  five minutes because this is like the headline topic it was in the thumbnail i have to talk about it
[2641.18 --> 2645.34]  when we don't people get mad especially because we can't change the thumbnails now
[2645.34 --> 2652.70]  all right so as intel's new ninth gen chips became available for pre-order there were no benchmarks
[2652.70 --> 2657.46]  available because tech journalists were under embargo now this is a behavior that we feel strongly
[2657.46 --> 2662.26]  is inappropriate we don't think you should take pre-orders um for products that haven't been
[2662.26 --> 2669.16]  evaluated by independent third parties but the reality of it is we are just we are just a a drop in the
[2669.16 --> 2675.38]  ocean of of voices of consumers that are apparently dumb enough to just go buy stuff without having
[2675.38 --> 2680.94]  seen it evaluated by a third party independent whatever so there's nothing we can do about
[2680.94 --> 2688.56]  pre-order culture apparently i wish we could but we can't yeah um one publication pc games n though
[2688.56 --> 2695.68]  published benchmarks conducted by a company called principled technologies their results were claiming
[2695.68 --> 2703.72]  that the 9900k was up to 50 percent faster than the ryzen 7 2700x in gaming so steve walton of tech spot
[2703.72 --> 2709.06]  immediately thought the data looked suspicious and eventually uncovered a series of steps taken to
[2709.06 --> 2715.24]  handicap amd okay that's got that's a little bit color commentary there a series of things that occurred
[2715.24 --> 2721.68]  or at least things that weren't done that should have been done to benefit yeah that made the amd chip
[2721.68 --> 2729.56]  not uh put it put forward its best showing and allowed the intel cpu to shine they used corsair
[2729.56 --> 2735.16]  vengeance memory without loading the xmp profile setting the frequency to 2933 and leaving the loose
[2735.16 --> 2739.70]  default memory timings in place the amd system used a stock cooler while intel used an nhu 14s that
[2739.70 --> 2744.90]  doesn't make a difference but sure whatever uh game mode was enabled on the amd system disabling 50
[2744.90 --> 2752.28]  of its course um something that anyone who knows much about benchmarking should have known like um so
[2752.28 --> 2758.56]  game mode is more for thread ripper and less for like four and eight core ryzen processor the argument
[2758.56 --> 2767.52]  with the cooler is because the case was really bad apparently sure um just adding some context there
[2767.52 --> 2773.22]  i have no information on whether or not it throttled so a big part of the scandal is that apparently
[2773.22 --> 2781.94]  intel contracted principled technologies um to to like evaluate the these processes and there's there's
[2781.94 --> 2788.22]  a hundred reasons why companies might do something like that it can be useful to sidestep internal
[2788.22 --> 2793.70]  politics to get like an independent third party's opinion on the the performance and the market
[2793.70 --> 2797.74]  positioning of your product that can help well everyone pricing everyone discounts internal
[2797.74 --> 2804.22]  yep benchmarks it can affect pricing it can it can affect forecasting um there you might want to show
[2804.22 --> 2812.12]  benchmarks to uh you know analysts or to um partners ahead of launch while the like just the independent
[2812.12 --> 2817.36]  press is still under embargo and if you just show your own numbers that you ran it lacks credibility
[2817.36 --> 2823.46]  so there's a lot of reasons why companies will contract someone third party in order to get their
[2823.46 --> 2830.26]  products evaluated um so there seems to be a couple of issues here one of them is that um
[2830.26 --> 2836.80]  principled technologies you know actually there was a there was a big to-do about uh ryan shroud from pc
[2836.80 --> 2843.42]  perspective creating like a secondary side business that's all about this kind of consultation for
[2843.42 --> 2848.28]  companies it's not this one just to be super clear yeah it's not principled technologies um so i think
[2848.28 --> 2854.54]  is shroud research something like that so anyway um so so there's a couple of problems here because
[2854.54 --> 2860.72]  one people are mad because the results were not necessarily reflective of the real world differences
[2860.72 --> 2865.52]  in performance between intel and their own processors and intel's new processor and amd's processors
[2865.52 --> 2872.84]  but i think that people are getting a making a bit of a mountain out of a mole here here because we
[2872.84 --> 2878.10]  don't mole here mole heel here because we don't know what the intent was we don't actually know if
[2878.10 --> 2883.02]  principled technologies is completely incompetent and we don't know if intel did this out of malice
[2883.02 --> 2889.68]  because obviously the pre-orders on a cpu remember this is a supply chain that has taken decades to
[2889.68 --> 2895.90]  develop like the pre-orders on a cpu are not significant this isn't like a game where you are
[2895.90 --> 2901.18]  making you know and i'm using arbitrary numbers here but where you are making 50 of your total sales
[2901.18 --> 2908.10]  for this title within the first couple of weeks it's not like that well you have you have experience
[2908.10 --> 2913.98]  at a retailer yes so you will typically see a spike you'll typically see a couple weeks where your
[2913.98 --> 2921.24]  where your weekly run rate is 30 to 50 to maybe even double if you have a great launch and then it
[2921.24 --> 2927.24]  settles in and you move the bulk of your product over the life cycle of the product so it's not like this
[2927.24 --> 2933.94]  was like a sneaky trick to you know sell a bunch of cpus before people realize they're garbage most
[2933.94 --> 2937.52]  people don't suddenly upgrade when something new comes out most people upgrade when they want a new
[2937.52 --> 2942.48]  computer another thing too is that all the industry scuttlebutt that i've seen that has any kind of
[2942.48 --> 2949.06]  credibility to it is that intel is going to be supply constrained on these chips anyway so if their intent
[2949.06 --> 2955.96]  was to like drum up a bunch of sales and make everything else look bad um then they're really
[2955.96 --> 2960.00]  shooting themselves in the foot with this 9900k launch because if they can't ship enough of the
[2960.00 --> 2963.76]  bloody things then what good are they doing themselves if they have everybody waiting around
[2963.76 --> 2970.78]  for 9900ks so that's another factor that makes me sort of wonder if um if we should attribute to
[2970.78 --> 2976.98]  malice what we could have attributed to incompetence and as much as intel um might have just been dumb
[2976.98 --> 2981.18]  here and hired the wrong consultancy firm might i recommend shroud research or whatever he calls himself
[2981.18 --> 2985.08]  these days next time that might be better um they had although that would have its own
[2985.08 --> 2990.40]  controversy but anyways they had to know that this was going to come back and reflect on them poorly
[2990.40 --> 2997.68]  if they chose the wrong third party house to do this testing um and so some of the backlash is
[2997.68 --> 3002.04]  definitely deserved because there also should have been oversight from intel where they should have
[3002.04 --> 3009.38]  gone well hold on a second that's not really right now with all of that said
[3009.38 --> 3017.92]  i don't understand why there was such a big blow up about this because what all of you and all of the
[3017.92 --> 3023.82]  rest of the tech press should have done is they should have completely ignored these numbers we should have
[3023.82 --> 3031.76]  looked at these numbers as exactly the same kinds of numbers that amd showed off at their hawaii launch event
[3031.76 --> 3038.80]  for the 290 series uh we should have ignored them the way that we ignored amd's numbers when they
[3038.80 --> 3044.66]  originally launched ryzen and i remember asking someone actually at an amd event why did you put
[3044.66 --> 3049.28]  twice as much memory in the intel system here as in your own system and they were like oh well we
[3049.28 --> 3053.24]  thought it was the fairest way ryzen had all kinds of issues with the memory controller they couldn't run
[3053.24 --> 3059.88]  it any other way um it's not any different from those graphs that nvidia shows at their launch events
[3059.88 --> 3067.80]  where they just have like like 18 games and then they show like a bar and they're like yeah it's like that much
[3067.80 --> 3072.66]  better when some of them might have been equal and some of them might have been weird anomalies where they
[3072.66 --> 3081.34]  perform like twice as fast it's not any different from anything that intel has ever shown why why are we
[3081.34 --> 3089.86]  treating anything other than post-launch benchmarks from independent parties as anything other than marketing fluff
[3089.86 --> 3097.38]  this i just don't see the difference and maybe i'm missing something here someone in twitch chat is
[3097.38 --> 3104.58]  pretty sure you are but hasn't pointed out a single necessarily reason why um yeah i agree on a lot of
[3104.58 --> 3112.60]  your points i think there are a few more issues with the testing um probably and and a little bit of the
[3112.60 --> 3118.12]  mentality behind it after watching the interview and watching some other things and i agree with some
[3118.12 --> 3121.34]  points and don't disagree and disagree with other points that were brought up in the interview and
[3121.34 --> 3129.38]  blah blah blah blah yeah um but yeah i don't we do this every single this seems like a just a little
[3129.38 --> 3134.04]  bit more than we do every single other time but we always do the same thing every single time right
[3134.04 --> 3139.84]  where every single reviewer are like wow those numbers are ridiculous why doesn't everyone wait until
[3139.84 --> 3145.24]  independent reviewers get their own numbers out then cross-reference across all reviewers yeah because
[3145.24 --> 3151.02]  you shouldn't also just look at one reviewer's because anyone can make a mistake even trout research can
[3151.02 --> 3158.40]  make a mistake um we've made plenty of mistakes like everyone makes mistakes that's why i mean when
[3158.40 --> 3163.92]  back before i got an opportunity to test the hardware personally or you know have someone on my staff who
[3163.92 --> 3170.32]  i'm directly you know sitting next to testing the hardware you know i would always read at least
[3170.32 --> 3175.30]  three to four reviews of anything that was back when you read reviews instead of watching yeah yeah
[3175.30 --> 3181.88]  dating myself a little bit here i guess and then if there was an anomaly you could go okay why then
[3181.88 --> 3187.86]  you start to dig in if everyone agrees it's usually fine unless something very scandalous happens later
[3187.86 --> 3193.48]  like that whole thing with the gtx 970 and the half a gig of ram that was slower than the rest or
[3193.48 --> 3198.50]  whatever the case may be so so far i've got out of the person that the testing methodology was flawed
[3198.50 --> 3202.76]  yeah that's exactly what we're talking about like there was certain issues like they didn't list
[3202.76 --> 3208.32]  uh the settings that they used for gta 5 and as yeah you and i know that's a real chore that would
[3208.32 --> 3213.02]  be that would be two pages of the document yeah because you can't just set gta 5 it is it is a real
[3213.02 --> 3219.40]  chore but it was also revealed in the interview especially that they might not be super educated
[3219.40 --> 3226.20]  on different ways that reviewers at least these days like modern reviewers are doing these different
[3226.20 --> 3231.26]  testing methodologies because there are a lot of weird things and i did say poor choice of there was
[3231.26 --> 3237.40]  third party yes that was already covered and i did say there's some blame lies with intel no matter what
[3237.40 --> 3243.34]  the argument linus is making and and by extension me because i agree with this is that it just doesn't
[3243.34 --> 3247.78]  matter and everyone should ignore it not that there wasn't problems with it yeah i think i think some
[3247.78 --> 3252.84]  people in twitch chat are are just pitchforking because they want to be mad about this whole
[3252.84 --> 3257.58]  situation which is great you should completely ignore those numbers because they're they're dumb
[3257.58 --> 3262.12]  and you should ignore them and you should be mad when manufacturers mislead you yes we're just saying
[3262.12 --> 3268.04]  that this isn't new no it's not unique to intel and yes it's trendy to hate on intel and we get it
[3268.04 --> 3276.82]  but they're this particular instance doesn't look especially different to me than what we've seen from
[3276.82 --> 3282.92]  until in the past amd nvidia you pretty much name it i mean do you remember do you remember the sales
[3282.92 --> 3288.48]  pitch microsoft gave for game mode we were actually talking about it in our in our writers meeting this
[3288.48 --> 3292.98]  monday we should revisit game mode because back when we did our video and it basically did nothing
[3292.98 --> 3297.36]  um a lot of the community feedback was like well they're gonna fix it over time and there's
[3297.36 --> 3301.68]  that's a good idea and we're like let's find out if they fixed that over time because i pretty
[3301.68 --> 3305.68]  much guarantee they didn't yeah no that would actually be awesome yeah i would love that video
[3305.68 --> 3311.02]  personally so so we should always take manufacturer claims with a grain of salt that's the lesson
[3311.02 --> 3315.64]  and we didn't learn it because people are still pre-ordering these things anyway and there's just
[3315.64 --> 3320.80]  nothing we can do about it so that's it end of wan show one more thing one more quick quick quick
[3320.80 --> 3326.52]  thing fine uh we talked about the giant like 50 million or whatever i don't remember the number
[3326.52 --> 3332.14]  account facebook breach not that long ago on wan show if you want to check how it impacted you
[3332.14 --> 3338.66]  log into facebook then go to facebook.com slash help slash security notice scroll down to the
[3338.66 --> 3343.16]  bottom thank you uh will from the flow plane team for sharing this with me scroll down to the bottom
[3343.16 --> 3348.34]  and then there should be a box which will give you some details about how secure your account is pay
[3348.34 --> 3353.96]  attention to the wording it will not say you were breached you were not breached it will sound a little
[3353.96 --> 3359.68]  bit more or a little bit less sure depending on how how problematic your account is so yeah check that
[3359.68 --> 3363.72]  out that's all i have to say um officially licensed wireless gamecube controllers are coming to switch
[3363.72 --> 3369.78]  that's pretty sick that is i just want to throw that out there and um also google plus hack and end
[3369.78 --> 3375.10]  of life lol google plus the gift that keeps on giving it's like ncix okay bye everyone bye
[3375.10 --> 3382.72]  oh yeah we can mention the discord logo contest we're doing a halloween themed uh ltt logo design
[3382.72 --> 3389.40]  contest on discord discord.tv i hope you guys can hear me uh the music for the intro is playing
[3389.40 --> 3394.18]  right now so anyway i gotta go i gotta go record that one last video today bye
[3394.18 --> 3394.54]  oh
[3394.54 --> 3398.54]  oh
[3398.54 --> 3407.36]  ah
[3407.36 --> 3407.48]  oh
