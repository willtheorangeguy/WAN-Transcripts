[0.00 → 3.76] Want to start the stream? Yes, I am sure I want to start the stream!
[5.24 → 10.40] I wouldn't have, uh, you know, eased up on my bladder muscles if I didn't want to start the stream.
[11.96 → 17.00] I did read the instructions. I followed the instructions. We are not on the test streaming thing.
[18.18 → 22.82] You, yes, I did set the title. Thank you, Jake. You're, you're, you are my chicken dinner.
[24.66 → 28.78] Like, you're a winner. That's what, that's what I mean. I don't mean that he's, like, kind of salty and savoury.
[28.78 → 29.92] I like your thighs.
[31.40 → 34.98] And your greasy white breast.
[35.26 → 39.38] A pretty mediocre show for you guys today because, frankly, there just...
[39.38 → 40.98] Says you, I'm bringing the awesome!
[41.48 → 43.60] There just wasn't really a lot going on this week.
[43.92 → 45.46] Why would you say that?
[45.54 → 46.24] Well, because...
[46.24 → 47.32] You want people to leave?
[47.70 → 51.50] They're not going to leave. I mean, they already went through the effort of clicking on this.
[51.60 → 53.70] They'll go down the go down with me.
[53.78 → 54.16] Yeah.
[54.44 → 57.08] I mean, the ship. Go down on the ship, not...
[57.08 → 58.34] No, you don't go down on the ship.
[58.34 → 60.74] You don't go down on you either. That's what I'm trying to get out of here.
[60.86 → 63.94] So, we do actually have some legitimately interesting topics.
[64.10 → 67.68] Google mandates two years of security updates for popular phones.
[67.78 → 69.62] How do we define popular? I guess we'll...
[69.62 → 70.90] Oh, we, there's a definition.
[71.08 → 72.26] Cross that bridge when we get to it.
[72.38 → 72.66] Mm-hmm.
[73.38 → 76.60] The meme tax means maybe you won't be able to upload to YouTube.
[77.10 → 77.48] Yeah.
[77.74 → 78.34] It...
[78.34 → 79.74] Okay, no, I'll talk, I'll talk more about it later.
[79.74 → 80.64] More bridges across.
[80.64 → 83.78] There's been another big win for right to repair.
[84.86 → 90.70] And the iPhone, iOS 12, defeats the gray key locker thing that police use.
[90.78 → 91.32] Suck it, police.
[92.18 → 92.62] But...
[92.62 → 94.34] I mean, blue lives matter.
[94.66 → 95.20] I mean...
[95.20 → 95.94] Ah, let's get out of here.
[95.98 → 96.34] Roll the intro.
[96.50 → 96.92] Wow.
[97.02 → 97.32] Ah!
[97.74 → 100.42] You are so never coming on WAN show again.
[100.76 → 100.98] Yes.
[100.98 → 130.96] You are so never coming on WAN show again.
[131.80 → 132.54] All right.
[133.48 → 135.48] Do you think that you have RBF?
[136.30 → 137.46] What is RBF?
[137.96 → 139.24] Resting mean face.
[139.80 → 140.32] Oh!
[140.58 → 142.10] Resting mean face.
[143.02 → 143.92] Um, you know what?
[143.92 → 145.66] Let's see your resting face at the camera.
[145.98 → 151.84] I would actually, yeah, I would much rather hear if you think I have resting.
[151.84 → 153.58] Resting B face is what's up.
[153.74 → 158.84] So, the only reason that it really comes up in my household a lot is that one of my daughters...
[158.84 → 159.84] Um...
[161.50 → 162.08] She has RBF?
[162.52 → 162.68] She's...
[162.68 → 163.46] She's like two.
[163.84 → 166.66] Um, actually, she's the older one.
[166.80 → 168.68] And it was much worse when she was two.
[168.80 → 169.86] So, we talk about it all the time.
[169.86 → 174.54] obviously we can't say the B word so we'd say resting B face I've never heard
[174.54 → 182.18] anyone put your face at rest okay yeah no I mean we'll let the audience we'll
[182.18 → 186.68] let the audience be the judge I don't think you have RBF are you kidding me I
[186.68 → 192.06] think it's more of a conscious thing with your dude look at this you do look at my
[192.06 → 201.30] eyebrows from the side okay pointing down before the show I was just going over my
[201.30 → 204.32] notes I looked up at the camera there I was like this is what I look like when
[204.32 → 208.74] I'm just reading stuff I'm just like yeah you have kind of an intense vibe to
[208.74 → 213.94] you like I've actually had I mean I don't think that the WAN show is really the
[213.94 → 222.00] place to air like HR issues to literally air it, but I've actually had people
[222.00 → 227.28] talk to me about how James can be kind of intense like I'm not sure if he likes
[227.28 → 232.80] me you know that's so funny I think that about Tyler I think Tyler I think I
[232.80 → 238.32] know he's the nicest guy a teddy bear, but he also hates all of us I think I don't
[238.32 → 243.02] think he do I don't I think Tyler is the least likely LMG employee to go
[243.02 → 246.66] postal well there's, but there's also other things that are just personal
[246.66 → 251.88] preference like if you walk by Tyler in the morning, and you haven't seen him yet
[251.88 → 257.46] he might just walk by you and not care to say good morning and I'm fine with
[257.46 → 259.62] that there's a lot of people here you want to spend half your day saying good
[259.62 → 264.54] morning yeah there's 20 people like I got past saying good morning to everyone
[264.54 → 270.22] probably around the time we hired you guys because okay I mean you were basically
[270.22 → 273.30] everyone that I passed in the morning was new and therefore didn't matter anyway
[273.30 → 277.66] no, but there was just too many people all of a sudden instead of because the
[277.66 → 281.74] upstairs used to be who the hell used to be upstairs there was no well there's
[281.74 → 287.08] there's Chelsea that's right there's cold the sales team was there so there
[287.08 → 293.80] was, and then it wasn't if you know Nick was in his oh no he wasn't yeah no
[293.80 → 296.92] Nick had it on no when I started Nick and Chelsea and Colton were all in that
[296.92 → 301.90] corner by where Anthony and Alex are now is this even interesting I mean it doesn't
[301.90 → 305.50] really matter, but I mean okay we'll, we'll get to why I'm wearing eyeliner
[305.50 → 308.98] shortly because I think that's what everyone's waiting to hear
[308.98 → 317.56] because it's Friday night baby yeah no, and you're taking me out dancing, and how come
[317.56 → 320.98] Batman doesn't dance anymore
[320.98 → 326.50] it's a Simpsons quote man okay you know what I'll explain why I'm wearing
[326.50 → 332.40] eyeliner so we must super chat us if you want to know you know no, no they
[332.40 → 335.44] don't have to see come on we're sellouts aren't we anyway we're shells that's
[335.44 → 343.36] that's the word on the street so basically I take exception to razors
[343.36 → 351.04] branding I mean I understand branding is it's its marketing, and it's its it's not
[351.04 → 358.12] meant to be just like a purely dry I do love this pillow though it's its not
[358.12 → 361.78] meant to be just like a purely dry description of the product like if is
[361.78 → 370.42] razor called their mice pretty good mouse that is pretty good and the
[370.42 → 374.74] ergonomics are good enough that the pro gamers we endorse didn't throw them away
[374.74 → 380.02] and it's pretty expensive but like it's pretty good like if they called it that
[380.02 → 386.26] obviously no one would buy it but if they call it mamba you know that's not it
[386.26 → 390.16] sounds a lot more appealing but the whole thing that they've started doing over
[390.16 → 395.44] the last few years when it's like they refer to themselves as the world's
[395.44 → 405.28] premier lifestyle brand for gamers lifestyle brand for gamers I kind of I
[405.28 → 412.04] kind of take exception to that because maybe I'm wrong but to me when I especially
[412.04 → 415.84] when I was younger when I didn't have like a full-time job because I was still
[415.84 → 423.70] in school to me what made something gaming was that it was no frills, and it was
[423.70 → 429.22] like great bang for the buck, and it had nothing about it that didn't give me more
[429.22 → 434.74] FPS function yes form completely function over form was gaming like an Athlon XP
[434.74 → 443.02] 2500 plus was like a gaming CPU because compared to I mean it's its it's funny
[443.02 → 448.40] some things never change AMD fanboys were just as diluted back then as they were like
[448.40 → 451.74] two years ago before Ry zen launched, and they still thought that AMD had processors
[451.74 → 459.48] worth buying like it's its amazing um and in and so for me when I bought a Barton 2500 plus
[459.48 → 465.98] I was the diluted AMD fanboy I was like yeah I'm going to overclock it to 2.2 gigahertz
[465.98 → 472.72] which is equivalent to a 3200 plus which is equivalent to a p4 3.2, but that was just AMD's
[472.72 → 479.48] marketing it wasn't equivalent to a p4 Northwood come on it wasn't even close not to mention that
[479.48 → 484.54] Northwood had hyper threading which at the time remember this is pre-dual core made a pretty
[484.54 → 492.34] significant difference to the overall usability of the experience and so to me if nothing else though
[492.34 → 500.86] a Barton 2500 plus was a gaming CPU because games back than only used a single core so you didn't
[500.86 → 508.78] need hyper threading to get better FPS do you think that the industry started to add frills even in gaming
[508.78 → 513.82] lineup things just by virtue of there being more competition like there you think there are there more
[513.82 → 519.36] gaming products now more gaming product lines now and then to differentiate they add in these
[519.36 → 526.58] they're just less spartan because it is different so hard to differentiate these days, and so I don't
[526.58 → 531.28] I don't blame them for doing it but basically the reason that I have the remnants of eyeliner on
[531.28 → 541.22] is because I'm kind of taking the piss um as like a gaming lifestyle sort of character at the
[541.22 → 545.10] beginning of the video for the Racer phone too which is going to be an interesting video by the way
[545.10 → 553.10] what I saw the getup how is that okay I'm like edgy I'm an edgy that's you trying to shut up you have such a
[553.10 → 554.24] warped view
[554.24 → 565.04] okay obviously it's like over the top and stupid so that's all you know what we'll let you yes
[565.04 → 572.20] very over the top very okay just I mean one part of the ensemble you didn't see was that I have a
[572.20 → 578.10] messenger bag that has an RGB keyboard in it that is illuminated as I'm just walking down the street
[578.10 → 586.32] that's a very edgy type thing to do yeah so it's its like it's like my gaming ness is more of an
[586.32 → 592.92] accessory and less of an actual like how many FPS do I get per dollar and I that's kind of my that's
[592.92 → 596.68] kind of my thing you should have been on a hoverboard I probably should have been on a
[596.68 → 604.26] hoverboard are we gonna uh do news I know you guys always do news like when I'm not on the show
[604.26 → 608.64] and I'm kind of I'm kind of trying to I'm kind of trying to fight it because I don't I don't really
[608.64 → 616.20] want to do news let's do some super chats yeah um what do we get here whoa uh Sichuan Sue says I was
[616.20 → 620.40] going to ask why you don't refer to float plane comments and only YouTube like in the iPhone response
[620.40 → 624.80] video, and then I saw you just did a float plane exclusive fair trade you're the best man keep it
[624.80 → 630.72] out well thank you you're the best too he's talking to me dude and bomb chewing says paying
[630.72 → 635.50] the Linus tax again for great free content you don't have to pay a tax for something that's free
[635.50 → 641.18] paying the Linus tax for a great free contact oh the tax is that he has to uh listen to you hey
[641.18 → 650.34] mate's watching what the heck are New Zealand dollars oh hi mate what up dude all right
[650.34 → 655.92] fine we'll do we'll do a news topic wait are you going to answer that first question no I don't know
[655.92 → 659.26] what was it I don't know it was a paragraph but oh yeah yeah he was like he's cool with it, so I was
[659.26 → 665.30] like yeah cool what yeah he was like why do you only refer to YouTube comments when you do uh like
[665.30 → 670.00] a response video okay I guess I could answer that it's because YouTube comments are more recognizable
[670.00 → 674.94] if we put up comments that are formatted for float plane only the like thousands of people on
[674.94 → 679.46] float plane are going to be able to relate to it so we tend to try to go as mainstream as possible
[679.46 → 684.10] in the content itself which is why you'll hear me say things like dislike the video if you want
[684.10 → 688.18] even though float plane doesn't have a dislike button so is this person referring to like
[688.18 → 693.38] graphically what they see on screen when we include comments, and they pop up are they asking why do they
[693.38 → 698.84] always pop up look like YouTube comments okay um Ben says please remember to mention folding month
[698.84 → 703.12] yeah it's folding month that's in the doc it is folding month I've been folding for like three weeks
[703.12 → 709.82] already, so I'm way ahead of you suckers but all month it's uh folding at home which is using your
[709.82 → 716.24] computer as an in a distributed network to help research different uh fight diseases like including
[716.24 → 721.24] cancer and Alzheimer's and all sorts of stuff there's even Ebola stuffs in there, and it's cool
[721.24 → 726.36] kind of topical right now I am uh warming up my house instead of turning the heat on all the super
[726.36 → 732.24] chats are for you Eddie says oh snap its laser time boys yeah all right fine we'll do it we'll do
[732.24 → 738.24] news topic google mandates two years of security updates for popular phones this was posted by
[738.24 → 743.54] die hard to live on the forum you're reading that like you've never seen that before like I post all
[743.54 → 749.20] the time yeah I know but like this is great I hate typing it so he's why would you type you
[749.20 → 754.94] could copy and paste that's what I do now oh okay it's great he's like here he's like we need to do
[754.94 → 759.32] these news topics we need to do these do you know how long James spends every week making sure
[759.32 → 763.50] that in the event that Luke and I can't figure out anything off-topic to discuss we will have
[763.50 → 770.12] something to talk about only for us to ignore like 80 of the topic sometimes do you ever go back
[770.12 → 775.22] and look at like what we did cover and what we didn't and get sometimes triggered I stopped well I
[775.22 → 781.92] did, and I stopped doing that when Luke and I do it we do the news yeah okay, but I also include
[781.92 → 786.98] fewer topics like when him and I do it I'll just put like eight in there hey I put a couple I left a couple
[786.98 → 790.30] in last week that I'd said hey we should really cover these next week, and you took them out
[790.30 → 795.58] you didn't tell me that well I put it in the doc oh you just overrode it no I scroll to
[795.58 → 801.36] the bottom see if anyone posted news items then I control a and delete oh all right well okay so the
[801.36 → 807.08] original article here is from the verge.com and in a nutshell every month the security team at
[807.08 → 812.36] Google releases a new set of patches for Android and every month carriers and manufacturers
[812.36 → 816.42] struggle to get them installed on the actual phones that people are actually using making
[816.42 → 825.80] that effort feel like well like James's effort on the WAN show doc wasted so confidential contracts
[825.80 → 832.64] obtained by the verge show that many manufacturers now have explicit obligations related to updates
[832.64 → 838.26] so this is Google trying to close in on the Apple lead because that's a really important part that
[838.26 → 843.16] our place that Apple still has an advantage we didn't explicitly cover that in the latest
[843.16 → 849.12] why iPhones are awesome video we did talk about updates yeah we talked about security we talked
[849.12 → 854.50] about security, but we didn't specifically talk about security updates and the scheduling and the
[854.50 → 859.40] scheduling the advantages they have here, so this is sweet uh do you think it's going to work
[859.40 → 865.16] well they're requiring they're requiring them to regularly install updates for any popular phone
[865.16 → 871.16] or tablet for at least two years they must provide at least four security updates within one year of
[871.16 → 875.42] the phone's launch the security updates are mandated within the second year as well but without a
[875.42 → 883.34] specified minimum number of releases and then these terms cover any device launched after January 31st 2018
[883.34 → 889.10] that's been activated by more than 100,000 users so that's your definition of popular 100,000 users, so I've
[889.10 → 904.10] talked about this a fair bit in the past um where you might encounter like a really cool device of some sort like a phone that's got like a really neat accessory I think the DOG gaming phone is going to be a great example of something like this where
[904.10 → 919.08] it's its really cool it's got some features that are truly standalone in the market like it's got a 90 hertz OLED display it's what you wanted the Racer phone to be yeah pretty, pretty much the first one yeah well neither of them are quite
[919.08 → 926.08] what I wanted the first Racer phone to be because I wanted it to have a good camera um and neither of them are are are good enough quite frankly
[926.08 → 931.22] so I think the DOG phone is a great example of this it's got really cool accessories have you seen the dual screen one
[931.22 → 949.06] yeah okay so we have a video coming we actually got our hands on all the accessories for the DOG phone so we've got the game controller that clips onto the sides we've got the dual screen so it comes with a 6,000 William hour battery in if it's got like a kind of ergonomic handle like controller handle for it
[949.06 → 964.06] and then it's got a second screen in the bottom kind of DS style that you can actually run apps independently on which tripped me out so our thumbnail I think we were going to do for the thumbnail and title we were going to do um we got every DOG phone accessory
[964.06 → 971.06] you know thumbnail face, but I think what we're going to go with is this phone runs two games at once
[971.06 → 974.32] yeah yeah Jake was telling me he had two separate games running at the same time
[974.32 → 976.06] yeah actually man not bad
[976.06 → 978.82] depending on the games that actually could be practical
[978.82 → 982.34] if you're playing something turn-based or something with waiting times
[982.34 → 987.04] you could play like a hand of poker while you're also I don't know playing Pokémon Go or some crap
[987.04 → 992.28] okay yeah I guess I could get into that I mean but the use case that we show isn't a very good one
[992.28 → 995.10] we have PUBG running on the top and Minecraft on the bottom
[995.10 → 997.68] oh and then PUBG and Fortnite would have been funny
[997.68 → 1004.24] so at one point in the video I'm playing the top screen and like Jake's got his hands in like in here like playing the bottom screen
[1004.24 → 1006.18] we're just like looking at each other this is ridiculous
[1006.18 → 1008.04] that's the best phone when you got two kids
[1008.04 → 1010.64] yeah, yeah so they can both they can both
[1010.64 → 1013.38] if you two don't learn to share
[1013.38 → 1017.22] then I'm going to make you both share the same one forever
[1017.22 → 1018.60] there it is
[1018.60 → 1019.18] um
[1019.18 → 1021.70] so anyway back to what I was saying
[1021.70 → 1026.70] even if you find a device that has like a really cool feature that you like
[1026.70 → 1029.00] you can end up
[1029.00 → 1032.04] having a bad experience almost no matter what you do
[1032.04 → 1033.76] because until you reach a certain threshold
[1033.76 → 1036.20] which is apparently a hundred thousand users
[1036.20 → 1039.18] you are even if you buy something like really expensive
[1039.18 → 1041.50] like a red hydrogen one would be a great example of this
[1041.50 → 1043.94] it's fifteen hundred dollar phone for the titanium version
[1043.94 → 1045.52] the manufacturer
[1045.52 → 1048.72] can only afford to support
[1048.72 → 1050.72] that which is popular
[1050.72 → 1052.32] that which sells well
[1052.32 → 1053.58] and you might think
[1053.58 → 1054.38] well I paid
[1054.38 → 1057.16] fifteen hundred dollars for this phone
[1057.16 → 1058.78] they should be able to support it
[1058.78 → 1060.80] but the issue is that
[1060.80 → 1061.56] even if you
[1061.56 → 1062.58] even if they were making
[1062.58 → 1064.32] five hundred dollars a phone versus
[1064.32 → 1066.58] three hundred dollars a phone
[1066.58 → 1067.14] that someone like
[1067.14 → 1068.54] you know Samsung was making
[1068.54 → 1069.82] if they're only selling
[1069.82 → 1071.20] a thousand units
[1071.20 → 1072.74] and Samsung is selling
[1072.74 → 1074.66] a hundred thousand units
[1074.66 → 1076.54] and these are all completely hypothetical numbers
[1076.54 → 1079.40] a thousand units times five hundred bucks
[1079.40 → 1080.80] is still only
[1080.80 → 1082.38] what is that
[1082.38 → 1083.82] five hundred thousand dollars
[1083.82 → 1084.70] the math checks out
[1084.70 → 1085.04] yeah you
[1085.04 → 1086.14] you can't
[1086.14 → 1088.06] you can't have a team of engineers
[1088.06 → 1089.96] working on this product
[1089.96 → 1091.40] for two years
[1091.40 → 1092.44] after their release
[1092.44 → 1094.14] continuing to provide updates
[1094.14 → 1095.04] for that kind of budget
[1095.04 → 1096.32] the numbers just
[1096.32 → 1097.62] don't work out
[1097.62 → 1099.20] and this is why in the past
[1099.20 → 1100.08] I would always say
[1100.08 → 1101.74] when you're shopping for a motherboard
[1101.74 → 1103.82] don't shop for the best motherboard
[1103.82 → 1105.52] shop for the most popular motherboard
[1105.52 → 1106.92] because that's the one that
[1106.92 → 1107.30] A
[1107.30 → 1108.84] they're going to have the budget
[1108.84 → 1110.98] in order to provide support to
[1110.98 → 1112.22] and B
[1112.22 → 1113.48] that's the one where
[1113.48 → 1113.98] they're going to have
[1113.98 → 1116.38] the loudest number of users
[1116.38 → 1117.70] squawking at them
[1117.70 → 1119.44] if they don't do it properly
[1119.44 → 1120.32] so there's going to be
[1120.32 → 1121.42] a lot of pressure on them
[1121.42 → 1123.04] whereas like it's a funny thing
[1123.04 → 1124.52] like I remember back in the days
[1124.52 → 1125.40] of Quad SLI
[1125.40 → 1126.26] when Nvidia launched
[1126.26 → 1128.36] the 7950 GX2
[1128.36 → 1130.02] I think is what the card was called
[1130.02 → 1131.42] but it was like this bizarre
[1131.42 → 1132.78] like I think this is pre-your
[1132.78 → 1134.62] like gaming enthusiasm days
[1134.62 → 1135.46] probably
[1135.46 → 1136.40] PC gaming
[1136.40 → 1136.86] remember this?
[1137.08 → 1137.18] sure
[1137.18 → 1139.44] so it was this bizarre card
[1139.44 → 1140.82] because it had a big PCB
[1140.82 → 1142.56] and then it had like a second one
[1142.56 → 1143.22] and then it had like
[1143.22 → 1145.94] a cooler on each one of them
[1145.94 → 1147.64] so one of the GPUs
[1147.64 → 1148.60] was like sandwiched
[1148.60 → 1149.74] right between the other PCB
[1149.74 → 1151.04] and it was only a dual slot card
[1151.04 → 1151.80] like it was
[1151.80 → 1152.60] it was really
[1152.60 → 1152.98] you know what
[1152.98 → 1153.88] I should probably just bring up
[1153.88 → 1154.94] a picture for everyone here
[1154.94 → 1155.38] show us Linus
[1155.38 → 1155.72] yeah
[1155.72 → 1158.24] 7950 GX2
[1158.24 → 1160.56] here I'll bring up my screen here
[1160.56 → 1162.58] like this is a really weird card
[1162.58 → 1163.22] look at this thing
[1163.22 → 1166.06] see that?
[1166.68 → 1167.78] so you've got your main
[1167.78 → 1168.10] oh yeah that's weird
[1168.10 → 1169.00] your main PCB
[1169.00 → 1170.26] that plugs into the slot
[1170.26 → 1171.54] and then you've got
[1171.54 → 1172.82] this second daughter board
[1172.82 → 1174.34] that had all the IO on it
[1174.34 → 1175.72] and see this cooler here?
[1175.82 → 1177.62] it actually had the same cooler
[1177.62 → 1178.18] under here
[1178.18 → 1178.78] oh I see
[1178.78 → 1180.16] so it was completely suffocated
[1180.16 → 1181.04] check this out
[1181.04 → 1181.62] check this out
[1181.62 → 1182.62] and then power
[1182.62 → 1184.30] only came in on this one
[1184.30 → 1185.34] and was passed through
[1185.34 → 1186.66] I don't remember how they did it
[1186.66 → 1187.16] or whatever
[1187.16 → 1188.10] like it was
[1188.10 → 1189.46] it was a weird card
[1189.46 → 1189.90] anyway
[1189.90 → 1191.88] there was a use case for this card
[1191.88 → 1193.80] four-way SLI
[1193.80 → 1194.86] this was the first time
[1194.86 → 1195.44] you could run
[1195.44 → 1197.72] four GPUs in SLI
[1197.72 → 1198.42] for NVIDIA
[1198.42 → 1199.20] actually I don't think
[1199.20 → 1199.92] Voodoo ever did that
[1199.92 → 1200.80] so this was the first time
[1200.80 → 1202.32] you could run four GPUs in SLI
[1202.32 → 1204.58] and the experience
[1204.58 → 1206.54] was terrible
[1206.54 → 1209.42] because the weird thing is
[1209.42 → 1209.96] and I'm not
[1209.96 → 1211.50] I'm not singling out NVIDIA here
[1211.50 → 1213.12] the weird thing is
[1213.12 → 1214.82] companies seem to feel like
[1214.82 → 1216.66] these customers
[1216.66 → 1217.72] that are giving them
[1217.72 → 1219.14] $1,500 in this case
[1219.14 → 1219.72] was I think about
[1219.72 → 1220.48] what a couple of those
[1220.48 → 1221.10] would cost you
[1221.10 → 1222.46] that the customers
[1222.46 → 1223.82] giving them these huge amounts of money
[1223.82 → 1225.32] well they must be just such fanatics
[1225.32 → 1226.04] that even if we
[1226.04 → 1227.48] don't update this
[1227.48 → 1228.48] and support this properly
[1228.48 → 1229.60] they're going to keep coming back
[1229.60 → 1230.56] and giving us money anyway
[1230.56 → 1231.08] so whatever
[1231.08 → 1232.98] whereas the mainstream user
[1232.98 → 1234.68] the one that really thinks about
[1234.68 → 1235.94] value for their dollar
[1235.94 → 1237.10] and goes out and buys
[1237.10 → 1237.50] you know
[1237.50 → 1239.32] a GTX 1063 gig
[1239.32 → 1240.72] or an RX 570
[1240.72 → 1241.96] or whatever the case may be
[1241.96 → 1243.32] that customer
[1243.32 → 1244.56] I feel like
[1244.56 → 1246.28] is more value sensitive
[1246.28 → 1247.48] and therefore
[1247.48 → 1249.40] will complain much louder
[1249.40 → 1251.56] if it doesn't get supported properly
[1251.56 → 1252.80] does that kind of make sense?
[1253.00 → 1254.20] well I wonder if these people
[1254.20 → 1255.28] these adopters
[1255.28 → 1255.94] of the high
[1255.94 → 1257.20] high-end stuff like this
[1257.20 → 1257.76] do you think
[1257.76 → 1259.74] they're mostly the type
[1259.74 → 1261.10] who aren't going to be
[1261.10 → 1261.84] using this stuff
[1261.84 → 1262.60] for a really long time
[1262.60 → 1263.20] because they're going to get
[1263.20 → 1263.88] the latest and greatest
[1263.88 → 1264.62] every cycle
[1264.62 → 1265.62] or do you think
[1265.62 → 1266.78] that they have the mindset
[1266.78 → 1268.44] of I'm spending a lot now
[1268.44 → 1268.98] and this is going to
[1268.98 → 1270.02] last me a long time
[1270.02 → 1271.38] would you say it's 50-50
[1271.38 → 1271.92] 80-20
[1271.92 → 1274.12] I would say that
[1274.12 → 1275.70] from working at NCI
[1275.70 → 1277.14] my experience
[1277.14 → 1278.38] was probably closer
[1278.38 → 1280.20] to like 95-5
[1280.20 → 1281.50] in which way?
[1281.56 → 1282.08] the guys
[1282.08 → 1283.16] that are buying
[1283.16 → 1284.06] the high end
[1284.06 → 1285.46] the really high-end stuff
[1285.46 → 1287.06] it's toying for boys
[1287.06 → 1288.20] whereas
[1288.20 → 1289.10] there's a
[1289.10 → 1290.02] there's a 5%
[1290.02 → 1290.40] of them
[1290.40 → 1290.94] that go
[1290.94 → 1291.94] you know what
[1291.94 → 1293.56] I just don't want to
[1293.56 → 1294.44] replace my computer
[1294.44 → 1294.98] very often
[1294.98 → 1295.64] so I'm just going to
[1295.64 → 1296.62] get the best thing now
[1296.62 → 1298.26] but the reality of it is
[1298.26 → 1298.90] if you
[1298.90 → 1300.28] especially then
[1300.28 → 1301.04] like back when I was
[1301.04 → 1301.98] working in the computer store
[1301.98 → 1302.94] I was like 10 years ago
[1302.94 → 1303.32] or whatever
[1303.32 → 1305.10] especially then
[1305.10 → 1306.52] it was a
[1306.52 → 1307.40] terrible
[1307.40 → 1308.62] terrible idea
[1308.62 → 1309.68] to buy the highest
[1309.68 → 1310.58] end thing now
[1310.58 → 1311.96] and hope that it would be
[1311.96 → 1312.62] future-proof
[1312.62 → 1313.18] these days
[1313.18 → 1314.00] I would actually make
[1314.00 → 1314.38] the argument
[1314.38 → 1315.38] it's not nearly as bad
[1315.38 → 1317.06] like if you went out
[1317.06 → 1318.04] and you bought yourself
[1318.04 → 1321.86] a 5960x
[1321.86 → 1323.26] so that was an extreme edition
[1323.26 → 1324.26] like three years ago
[1324.26 → 1326.34] it was an 8 core processor
[1326.34 → 1327.62] okay
[1327.62 → 1328.76] we have now
[1328.76 → 1329.26] just now
[1329.26 → 1329.98] gotten to the point
[1329.98 → 1330.56] where the mainstream
[1330.56 → 1332.04] is getting an 8 core processor
[1332.04 → 1333.08] you effectively
[1333.08 → 1333.72] and yeah
[1333.72 → 1334.82] they're much higher clocked
[1334.82 → 1335.34] and all that stuff
[1335.34 → 1336.08] like you don't expect it
[1336.08 → 1337.20] to run exactly
[1337.20 → 1338.04] like the brand new one
[1338.04 → 1339.14] but you're still
[1339.14 → 1339.84] hanging in there
[1339.84 → 1342.62] whereas if you bought
[1342.62 → 1343.82] yourself at that time
[1343.82 → 1344.28] a
[1344.28 → 1344.88] would have been
[1344.88 → 1345.94] like a 4770
[1345.94 → 1346.98] you are now
[1346.98 → 1348.08] getting to the point
[1348.08 → 1348.56] where there are
[1348.56 → 1349.34] going to be games
[1349.34 → 1350.40] right around the corner
[1350.40 → 1351.06] that are going to want
[1351.06 → 1351.76] more than 4 cores
[1351.76 → 1353.20] so yeah
[1353.20 → 1353.76] that person
[1353.76 → 1354.50] who spent more
[1354.50 → 1355.50] might get another year
[1355.50 → 1356.32] or two out of their system
[1356.32 → 1357.50] does that kind of make sense
[1357.50 → 1358.92] sure
[1358.92 → 1360.40] so you think then
[1360.40 → 1361.20] so what you described
[1361.20 → 1361.64] a second ago
[1361.64 → 1362.54] where it's 95.5
[1362.54 → 1363.62] then that is an incentive
[1363.62 → 1364.70] for companies
[1364.70 → 1366.34] to support the most popular
[1366.34 → 1367.16] and not the most expensive
[1367.16 → 1367.50] yeah
[1367.50 → 1368.12] but okay
[1368.12 → 1369.40] going back to the phones though
[1369.40 → 1370.06] right
[1370.06 → 1370.84] the original thing
[1370.84 → 1371.18] right
[1371.18 → 1371.86] the actual topic
[1371.86 → 1372.22] so look
[1372.22 → 1373.70] he's just supposed to do news
[1373.70 → 1374.36] here's the thing though
[1374.36 → 1374.94] so boring
[1374.94 → 1375.94] the chain is longer
[1375.94 → 1376.88] than just the
[1376.88 → 1378.90] the provider of the software
[1378.90 → 1379.56] in this case Google
[1379.56 → 1380.32] and then the OEM
[1380.32 → 1382.24] there are the carriers as well
[1382.24 → 1382.88] and they don't talk
[1382.88 → 1383.68] about the carriers here
[1383.68 → 1386.08] and with Android phones
[1386.08 → 1386.98] the carriers can put
[1386.98 → 1388.20] in their own special sauce
[1388.20 → 1390.28] so a new Android comes out
[1390.28 → 1391.16] then the OEM
[1391.16 → 1392.10] augments it
[1392.10 → 1392.72] to their liking
[1392.72 → 1394.34] then the carrier
[1394.34 → 1395.10] puts their own
[1395.10 → 1396.12] special carrier apps
[1396.12 → 1396.54] on it
[1396.54 → 1397.30] and that takes
[1397.30 → 1397.48] like
[1397.48 → 1398.08] Dell TV
[1398.08 → 1398.94] that takes
[1398.94 → 1400.02] two to three weeks
[1400.02 → 1400.90] at best
[1400.90 → 1401.22] yeah
[1401.22 → 1402.46] what happens
[1402.46 → 1404.44] when these OEMs
[1404.44 → 1405.40] are obligated to do
[1405.40 → 1406.44] four security updates
[1406.44 → 1406.78] a year
[1406.78 → 1407.62] the last one
[1407.62 → 1408.08] that comes out
[1408.08 → 1408.70] for that year
[1408.70 → 1409.58] gets delayed
[1409.58 → 1410.38] because the carrier
[1410.38 → 1411.40] has to spend a month
[1411.40 → 1412.06] working on it
[1412.06 → 1413.62] reaches the contract
[1413.62 → 1414.42] with Google
[1414.42 → 1416.80] and then they get reprimanded
[1416.80 → 1417.48] like what's going to happen
[1417.48 → 1418.24] it looks like
[1418.24 → 1419.10] what could happen
[1419.10 → 1419.88] is if they fail
[1419.88 → 1420.94] to keep the devices updated
[1420.94 → 1421.94] Google could withhold
[1421.94 → 1422.46] approval
[1422.46 → 1423.62] for new devices
[1423.62 → 1424.56] so they could like
[1424.56 → 1425.24] play the game
[1425.24 → 1426.02] where they could be like
[1426.02 → 1426.48] okay we know
[1426.48 → 1428.26] we're really busy
[1428.26 → 1429.02] you know
[1429.02 → 1429.90] working on something
[1429.90 → 1430.52] right now
[1430.52 → 1431.72] we don't have anything
[1431.72 → 1432.44] new to launch
[1432.44 → 1433.16] at the moment
[1433.16 → 1434.04] so we can
[1434.04 → 1435.50] fall behind
[1435.50 → 1437.22] and then we'll like
[1437.22 → 1438.20] get it dealt with later
[1438.20 → 1438.92] when we need to
[1438.92 → 1439.50] release something
[1439.50 → 1439.92] but I
[1439.92 → 1443.72] I think the big thing
[1443.72 → 1444.18] for me
[1444.18 → 1444.94] is
[1444.94 → 1446.80] I have yet to see
[1446.80 → 1447.70] any evidence
[1447.70 → 1448.46] that Google
[1448.46 → 1449.62] has the stones
[1449.62 → 1451.64] to back this up
[1451.64 → 1454.36] because they're still
[1454.36 → 1455.96] allowing carrier nonsense
[1455.96 → 1458.16] that as far as I can tell
[1458.16 → 1459.24] Apple shut down
[1459.24 → 1460.26] ages ago
[1460.26 → 1460.72] that's correct
[1460.72 → 1461.72] like there's
[1461.72 → 1463.62] I think you just cited
[1463.62 → 1464.22] one from LG
[1464.22 → 1464.68] but there's
[1464.68 → 1465.80] or from a carrier
[1465.80 → 1466.16] but there's
[1466.16 → 1466.90] AT&T
[1466.90 → 1468.08] like OneDrive
[1468.08 → 1468.96] type stuff
[1468.96 → 1470.00] AT&T has
[1470.00 → 1471.20] so much
[1471.20 → 1471.76] so does Verizon
[1471.76 → 1472.68] but they're not
[1472.68 → 1473.48] on Apple phones
[1473.48 → 1473.82] at all
[1473.82 → 1474.14] yeah
[1474.14 → 1475.02] at all
[1475.02 → 1475.54] so do you think
[1475.54 → 1476.18] that if it becomes
[1476.18 → 1476.68] a problem
[1476.68 → 1477.58] where the carriers
[1477.58 → 1478.14] are the limiting
[1478.14 → 1478.70] factor here
[1478.70 → 1479.16] that are making
[1479.16 → 1480.12] the OEMs late
[1480.12 → 1481.82] with the contractually
[1481.82 → 1483.10] obligated updates
[1483.10 → 1484.30] then maybe Google
[1484.30 → 1486.06] or those OEMs
[1486.06 → 1487.32] will just crack down
[1487.32 → 1487.56] and be like
[1487.56 → 1488.20] there's no more
[1488.20 → 1488.96] carrier app
[1488.96 → 1490.06] baloney at all
[1490.06 → 1490.80] we're not doing it
[1490.80 → 1491.46] I don't know
[1491.46 → 1492.24] how they'd pull it off
[1492.24 → 1492.92] because the thing
[1492.92 → 1493.96] is that a lot of
[1493.96 → 1494.58] like it's all about
[1494.58 → 1495.30] positioning right
[1495.30 → 1495.96] the reason Apple
[1495.96 → 1496.78] can get away with it
[1496.78 → 1497.78] is because the iPhone
[1497.78 → 1498.92] is a top tier device
[1498.92 → 1500.72] so the carrier
[1500.72 → 1502.48] is not expected
[1502.48 → 1503.50] to you know
[1503.50 → 1504.48] sell it for
[1504.48 → 1505.46] zero dollars
[1505.46 → 1506.08] on contract
[1506.08 → 1507.42] and then subsidize
[1507.42 → 1508.24] it with like
[1508.24 → 1509.40] cloud storage
[1509.40 → 1511.18] and like a TV
[1511.18 → 1511.74] subscription
[1511.74 → 1512.36] and an NBA
[1512.36 → 1512.90] subscription
[1512.90 → 1513.34] and all that
[1513.34 → 1513.92] kind of crap
[1513.92 → 1514.38] all that kind
[1514.38 → 1515.30] of add-on stuff
[1515.30 → 1516.78] that they can use
[1516.78 → 1517.78] to subsidize
[1517.78 → 1518.82] the cost of that
[1518.82 → 1520.00] hardware in the first place
[1520.00 → 1520.92] plus there's competition
[1520.92 → 1521.88] because if you're
[1521.88 → 1522.46] an Android device
[1522.46 → 1523.66] if you're the V30
[1523.66 → 1524.04] they're like
[1524.04 → 1524.62] well we don't like
[1524.62 → 1524.98] your terms
[1524.98 → 1525.48] we're just gonna
[1525.48 → 1526.64] have the P20
[1526.64 → 1528.14] see ya
[1528.14 → 1528.54] yeah
[1528.54 → 1529.38] just another
[1529.38 → 1530.40] flagship Android
[1530.40 → 1530.88] yep
[1530.88 → 1532.84] so I think that
[1532.84 → 1533.50] Apple's in a fairly
[1533.50 → 1534.44] unique position there
[1534.44 → 1536.54] but I do also
[1536.54 → 1537.70] think that carriers
[1537.70 → 1538.60] like Samsung
[1538.60 → 1540.58] should be in a position
[1540.58 → 1541.56] where we shouldn't
[1541.56 → 1541.94] have to deal
[1541.94 → 1542.52] with that anymore
[1542.52 → 1544.20] so I'd like to see
[1544.20 → 1545.08] them push back harder
[1545.08 → 1545.62] like one thing
[1545.62 → 1546.20] that has really
[1546.20 → 1547.14] irked me about Samsung
[1547.14 → 1547.92] over the last couple
[1547.92 → 1548.48] of generations
[1548.48 → 1549.60] I actually don't know
[1549.60 → 1550.52] if the Note 9 did it
[1550.52 → 1551.14] I'd have to put in
[1551.14 → 1551.68] a different sim
[1551.68 → 1552.28] to find out
[1552.28 → 1553.52] but immediately
[1553.52 → 1554.58] when you put in a sim
[1554.58 → 1555.34] it comes unlocked
[1555.34 → 1556.36] you put in a sim
[1556.36 → 1557.66] and it locks to that carrier
[1557.66 → 1558.58] oh that's weak
[1558.58 → 1559.04] which to me is
[1559.04 → 1560.28] completely unacceptable
[1560.28 → 1561.16] that's weak dude
[1561.16 → 1562.66] you know what I learned today
[1562.66 → 1563.10] yeah
[1563.10 → 1563.64] you know
[1563.64 → 1566.08] Samsung has the greatest
[1566.08 → 1566.54] market share
[1566.54 → 1567.32] obviously globally
[1567.32 → 1567.90] but even
[1567.90 → 1569.60] in North America
[1569.60 → 1570.84] they have like 35%
[1570.84 → 1571.96] there's more people
[1571.96 → 1572.38] in North America
[1572.38 → 1573.02] with Samsung's
[1573.02 → 1573.60] than iPhones
[1573.60 → 1574.74] but today I learned
[1574.74 → 1575.86] that in China
[1575.86 → 1576.42] their penetration
[1576.42 → 1577.66] is only like 5%
[1577.66 → 1579.46] that's interesting
[1579.46 → 1580.20] in China
[1580.20 → 1581.40] it's all Chinese phones
[1581.40 → 1583.54] isn't that crazy
[1583.54 → 1585.14] the thing that really
[1585.14 → 1585.92] baffles me
[1585.92 → 1586.70] is that
[1586.70 → 1588.70] especially a couple
[1588.70 → 1589.72] generations ago
[1589.72 → 1591.78] the cameras
[1591.78 → 1593.78] on the non-Chinese phones
[1593.78 → 1594.90] were so
[1594.90 → 1596.24] night and day
[1596.24 → 1597.46] better than the Chinese ones
[1597.46 → 1597.94] that it just
[1597.94 → 1599.36] like I couldn't figure out
[1599.36 → 1600.60] why the demand
[1600.60 → 1601.68] didn't overcome
[1601.68 → 1602.26] whether
[1602.26 → 1602.98] like I
[1602.98 → 1603.54] and
[1603.54 → 1604.68] forgive me
[1604.68 → 1605.18] because I'm speaking
[1605.18 → 1605.82] out of ignorance here
[1605.82 → 1606.70] I don't know if it's nationalism
[1606.70 → 1607.90] I don't know if it's
[1607.90 → 1608.76] import tariffs
[1608.76 → 1609.64] I don't know if it's
[1609.64 → 1610.46] other governmental
[1610.46 → 1611.00] restrictions
[1611.00 → 1612.08] I don't know
[1612.08 → 1612.96] what the factors are
[1612.96 → 1613.72] why they only use
[1613.72 → 1614.40] Chinese phones
[1614.40 → 1615.98] but you'd think
[1615.98 → 1617.44] the demand for
[1617.44 → 1618.18] better
[1618.18 → 1619.92] might have outstripped
[1619.92 → 1621.40] whatever those
[1621.40 → 1622.20] other factors were
[1622.20 → 1622.88] and people would have
[1622.88 → 1623.82] people would have
[1623.82 → 1624.28] been able to go
[1624.28 → 1624.88] oh wow
[1624.88 → 1625.72] this is like
[1625.72 → 1627.14] very obviously
[1627.14 → 1628.50] way better
[1628.50 → 1629.16] ugh
[1629.16 → 1631.12] because I mean
[1631.12 → 1631.62] there weren't
[1631.62 → 1632.18] there weren't even
[1632.18 → 1633.46] huge cost differences
[1633.46 → 1634.26] in many cases
[1634.26 → 1634.76] are you sure
[1634.76 → 1635.96] the flagship Chinese phones
[1635.96 → 1636.92] weren't they subsidized
[1636.92 → 1638.44] see that I don't know
[1638.44 → 1638.84] so
[1638.84 → 1640.02] maybe there was
[1640.02 → 1640.78] a huge cost difference
[1640.78 → 1641.62] I do know though
[1641.62 → 1642.44] that some of the
[1642.44 → 1643.16] flagships now
[1643.16 → 1644.30] are really priced
[1644.30 → 1645.08] about like
[1645.08 → 1645.72] South Korean
[1645.72 → 1647.22] or North American
[1647.22 → 1647.98] flagships
[1647.98 → 1648.72] I mean of course
[1648.72 → 1649.86] they're all made
[1649.86 → 1650.44] in China anyway
[1650.44 → 1651.64] but I mean like
[1651.64 → 1652.70] where they were designed
[1652.70 → 1654.20] designed by Apple
[1654.20 → 1654.94] in California
[1654.94 → 1657.84] so last week
[1657.84 → 1658.90] you guys
[1658.90 → 1659.88] well I wrote it
[1659.88 → 1660.30] in the notes
[1660.30 → 1661.06] I don't know
[1661.06 → 1661.84] if you talked about it
[1661.84 → 1663.10] but we learned that
[1663.10 → 1664.84] because of
[1664.84 → 1666.44] GDPR
[1666.44 → 1667.22] and Europe
[1667.22 → 1669.00] GDPR
[1669.00 → 1669.80] whatever
[1669.80 → 1670.48] the thing with
[1670.48 → 1671.96] all the notifications
[1671.96 → 1672.76] on all your favourite
[1672.76 → 1673.04] websites
[1673.04 → 1673.80] so Google was found
[1673.80 → 1675.02] to be illegally
[1675.02 → 1676.30] acting monopolistically
[1676.30 → 1677.48] he's leaving
[1677.48 → 1678.38] I'm talking to you
[1678.38 → 1679.08] I'm talking to everyone
[1679.08 → 1679.78] but I'm also talking
[1679.78 → 1680.42] to you, you know
[1680.42 → 1681.26] I'm listening
[1681.26 → 1683.70] so Google had to
[1683.70 → 1684.22] unbundle
[1684.22 → 1685.68] it used to be the case
[1685.68 → 1686.34] that even though
[1686.34 → 1687.58] Android is open source
[1687.58 → 1689.48] the
[1689.48 → 1690.34] what was it
[1690.34 → 1691.26] the Play Store
[1691.26 → 1693.60] Google Chrome
[1693.60 → 1694.56] Chrome and Google Search
[1694.56 → 1695.20] always had to come
[1695.20 → 1695.56] on the phone
[1695.56 → 1696.36] and it was all bundled
[1696.36 → 1696.96] and that was illegal
[1696.96 → 1697.42] so then
[1697.42 → 1699.12] they ordered them
[1699.12 → 1700.02] to pay a big fine
[1700.02 → 1700.78] and now they have to
[1700.78 → 1701.94] give options
[1701.94 → 1702.90] to OEMs
[1702.90 → 1704.14] and so
[1704.14 → 1706.22] a device gets subsidized
[1706.22 → 1706.82] by the fact that
[1706.82 → 1707.46] Chrome is on there
[1707.46 → 1708.16] because there's
[1708.16 → 1709.10] advertising revenue
[1709.10 → 1710.40] but then now
[1710.40 → 1711.36] if you're going to be able
[1711.36 → 1712.00] to get an Android phone
[1712.00 → 1713.00] that doesn't have Chrome on it
[1713.00 → 1713.86] then Google still has to
[1713.86 → 1714.46] make that money
[1714.46 → 1715.32] so they're just
[1715.32 → 1716.76] charging a licensing fee
[1716.76 → 1717.18] but we didn't know
[1717.18 → 1717.80] how much it costs
[1717.80 → 1718.58] and now we know
[1718.58 → 1719.38] how much it costs
[1719.38 → 1720.84] is this kind of
[1720.84 → 1721.94] gives us an idea
[1721.94 → 1723.54] of how much money
[1723.54 → 1724.70] Google expects to make
[1724.70 → 1725.54] off the Play Store
[1725.54 → 1726.14] off Chrome
[1726.14 → 1727.06] and off Google Search
[1727.06 → 1727.80] well I think that
[1727.80 → 1728.78] the fees here
[1728.78 → 1729.88] would be slightly higher
[1729.88 → 1730.72] than what they made
[1730.72 → 1731.48] off of that ad revenue
[1731.48 → 1731.80] I think so too
[1731.80 → 1732.50] because I'd be
[1732.50 → 1733.28] I'd be given
[1733.28 → 1735.20] I'd be given the EU
[1735.20 → 1735.94] the old
[1735.94 → 1736.52] you know
[1736.52 → 1737.30] I'd be okay
[1737.30 → 1739.52] maybe not the old FM
[1739.52 → 1740.42] but I'd be trying
[1740.42 → 1741.26] to create pressure
[1741.26 → 1742.62] I'd be trying to say
[1742.62 → 1743.24] look
[1743.24 → 1743.80] yeah
[1743.80 → 1745.06] the way you had it
[1745.06 → 1745.82] was pretty good
[1745.82 → 1746.78] so
[1746.78 → 1748.06] you don't like it
[1748.06 → 1748.60] okay
[1748.60 → 1749.84] here's something worse
[1749.84 → 1750.76] enjoy
[1750.76 → 1751.92] you've got options now
[1751.92 → 1752.96] but there's a clear incentive
[1752.96 → 1753.60] to go for
[1753.60 → 1754.76] to just go back
[1754.76 → 1755.46] to the old way
[1755.46 → 1756.22] yeah exactly
[1756.22 → 1757.28] so what we found out
[1757.28 → 1757.78] is that
[1757.78 → 1758.76] it could cost
[1758.76 → 1760.10] up to $40 per device
[1760.10 → 1761.72] sorry
[1761.72 → 1764.00] $40 a device
[1764.00 → 1764.82] that's how much
[1764.82 → 1765.86] the iPhone
[1765.86 → 1767.16] Apple was paying
[1767.16 → 1767.86] for the Samsung
[1767.86 → 1769.04] hold on a minute
[1769.04 → 1769.38] Olds
[1769.38 → 1770.10] consider
[1770.10 → 1771.44] consider this
[1771.44 → 1772.02] you guys
[1772.02 → 1774.74] the bomb cost
[1774.74 → 1775.56] of like an
[1775.56 → 1777.00] iPhone XS
[1777.00 → 1777.62] bomb means
[1777.62 → 1778.70] bill of materials
[1778.70 → 1779.08] yeah
[1779.08 → 1780.20] the bare
[1780.20 → 1781.50] hardware cost
[1781.50 → 1782.04] of something like
[1782.04 → 1783.02] an iPhone XS
[1783.02 → 1783.94] or like a Note 9
[1783.94 → 1785.14] is somewhere in the
[1785.14 → 1785.60] neighbourhood of
[1785.60 → 1786.26] usually what
[1786.26 → 1787.74] around $250 to $350
[1787.74 → 1789.44] that sounds right
[1789.44 → 1790.22] we actually had
[1790.22 → 1790.76] all those figures
[1790.76 → 1791.38] in one of our
[1791.38 → 1792.08] why are you buying
[1792.08 → 1792.80] these episodes
[1792.80 → 1793.02] did we have them
[1793.02 → 1793.40] okay
[1793.40 → 1794.54] the point is
[1794.54 → 1795.36] they are like
[1795.36 → 1796.76] a third
[1796.76 → 1797.90] like a quarter
[1797.90 → 1799.26] of the final sale price
[1799.26 → 1800.16] because there's a lot
[1800.16 → 1801.00] of costs associated
[1801.00 → 1801.38] with bringing
[1801.38 → 1802.06] something to market
[1802.06 → 1803.00] including whether
[1803.00 → 1803.96] you like it or not
[1803.96 → 1805.02] things like advertising
[1805.02 → 1806.74] that do factor
[1806.74 → 1807.58] into the final price
[1807.58 → 1808.02] of the phone
[1808.02 → 1810.04] so adding
[1810.04 → 1811.24] $40
[1811.24 → 1811.90] just
[1811.90 → 1813.26] right there
[1813.26 → 1813.74] up front
[1813.74 → 1814.44] $40
[1814.44 → 1816.38] has the potential
[1816.38 → 1817.04] to increase
[1817.04 → 1818.08] your phone's cost
[1818.08 → 1819.20] somewhere in the
[1819.20 → 1819.94] neighbourhood of like
[1819.94 → 1821.00] 20%
[1821.00 → 1822.18] huh
[1822.18 → 1823.34] sorry
[1823.34 → 1823.88] I'll let you
[1823.88 → 1824.16] continue
[1824.16 → 1824.30] okay
[1824.30 → 1824.72] so
[1824.72 → 1825.82] so how much
[1825.82 → 1826.26] they cost
[1826.26 → 1826.94] depends on the
[1826.94 → 1827.84] country in the EU
[1827.84 → 1829.14] and the type of device
[1829.14 → 1830.32] so EU countries
[1830.32 → 1831.08] are divided into
[1831.08 → 1831.66] three tiers
[1831.66 → 1832.48] with the highest
[1832.48 → 1832.92] countries
[1832.92 → 1834.06] the highest fees
[1834.06 → 1834.88] come from the UK
[1834.88 → 1835.34] Sweden
[1835.34 → 1835.78] Germany
[1835.78 → 1836.16] Norway
[1836.16 → 1836.76] and Netherlands
[1836.76 → 1837.94] and in those
[1837.94 → 1838.32] countries
[1838.32 → 1839.52] the devices
[1839.52 → 1840.38] with higher
[1840.38 → 1841.36] pixel densities
[1841.36 → 1841.80] pay more
[1841.80 → 1842.40] so if you've
[1842.40 → 1842.90] got a pixel
[1842.90 → 1843.52] density higher
[1843.52 → 1844.26] than 500
[1844.26 → 1844.90] PPI
[1844.90 → 1845.80] then you ought
[1845.80 → 1845.98] to pay
[1845.98 → 1846.38] the $40
[1846.38 → 1846.84] fee
[1846.84 → 1848.04] and phones
[1848.04 → 1848.38] that have
[1848.38 → 1849.04] PPIs like
[1849.04 → 1849.44] that are
[1849.44 → 1850.18] pixels per inch
[1850.18 → 1851.72] include
[1851.72 → 1853.10] pixels 2 and 3
[1853.10 → 1853.64] XL
[1853.64 → 1855.26] and the S9
[1855.26 → 1856.16] S9 plus
[1856.16 → 1856.96] interesting
[1856.96 → 1857.50] then the next
[1857.50 → 1857.82] tier down
[1857.82 → 1858.40] is 400
[1858.40 → 1858.96] to 500
[1858.96 → 1859.90] pixels per inch
[1859.90 → 1860.76] and they have
[1860.76 → 1861.24] to pay 20
[1861.24 → 1861.58] bucks
[1861.58 → 1862.22] in those
[1862.22 → 1862.56] countries
[1862.56 → 1863.50] and that's
[1863.50 → 1863.84] the pixel
[1863.84 → 1864.50] 3 the small
[1864.50 → 1864.76] one
[1864.76 → 1866.14] and interestingly
[1866.14 → 1866.62] all the
[1866.62 → 1867.38] iPhone XS
[1867.38 → 1867.76] the X
[1867.76 → 1868.50] the XS
[1868.50 → 1869.00] the XS
[1869.00 → 1869.34] max
[1869.34 → 1870.80] I'm surprised
[1870.80 → 1871.56] that all
[1871.56 → 1872.14] those iPhones
[1872.14 → 1873.50] have lower
[1873.50 → 1874.28] pixel densities
[1874.28 → 1874.72] than the
[1874.72 → 1876.46] pixel 2 XL
[1876.46 → 1876.76] even
[1876.76 → 1877.98] the new
[1877.98 → 1879.66] iPhone XS
[1879.66 → 1880.12] has a lower
[1880.12 → 1880.74] pixel density
[1880.74 → 1881.04] than the
[1881.04 → 1881.28] I mean
[1881.28 → 1881.88] Apple
[1881.88 → 1882.94] went straight
[1882.94 → 1883.84] to retina
[1883.84 → 1884.72] and then just
[1884.72 → 1885.44] completely backed
[1885.44 → 1885.64] off
[1885.64 → 1886.10] they were like
[1886.10 → 1886.36] yep
[1886.36 → 1887.20] no this is
[1887.20 → 1887.56] good enough
[1887.56 → 1888.58] and frankly
[1888.58 → 1889.10] I agree
[1889.10 → 1889.60] with them
[1889.60 → 1890.50] because you
[1890.50 → 1891.18] can't tell
[1891.18 → 1891.84] looking at an
[1891.84 → 1892.62] iPhone XS
[1892.62 → 1893.44] or XS max
[1893.44 → 1894.60] that it
[1894.60 → 1895.72] has lower
[1895.72 → 1896.30] pixel density
[1896.30 → 1896.90] than a Note 9
[1896.90 → 1897.54] or an S9 plus
[1897.54 → 1898.44] you cannot tell
[1898.44 → 1898.88] well that's what
[1898.88 → 1899.32] retina is
[1899.32 → 1899.62] because that's
[1899.62 → 1900.42] exactly the point
[1900.42 → 1901.48] so then the
[1901.48 → 1902.02] next tier is
[1902.02 → 1902.68] under 400
[1902.68 → 1903.46] pixels per inch
[1903.46 → 1903.90] where you only
[1903.90 → 1904.40] pay $10
[1904.40 → 1905.52] in those
[1905.52 → 1906.08] expensive
[1906.08 → 1906.52] countries
[1906.52 → 1907.00] and the
[1907.00 → 1907.42] iPhone
[1907.42 → 1908.92] XR
[1908.92 → 1909.70] fits into
[1909.70 → 1910.32] that category
[1910.32 → 1911.08] but then
[1911.08 → 1911.56] in some
[1911.56 → 1912.16] other countries
[1912.16 → 1912.86] where they're
[1912.86 → 1913.56] not the
[1913.56 → 1914.64] high paying
[1914.64 → 1915.08] countries
[1915.08 → 1915.70] the fee
[1915.70 → 1915.96] can be
[1915.96 → 1916.38] as little
[1916.38 → 1917.78] as $2.50
[1917.78 → 1919.54] per device
[1919.54 → 1920.70] like a budget
[1920.70 → 1921.28] phone in India
[1921.28 → 1921.90] so I wonder
[1921.90 → 1922.50] if this
[1922.50 → 1923.34] really gives
[1923.34 → 1923.90] us some
[1923.90 → 1924.40] insight
[1924.40 → 1925.34] into how
[1925.34 → 1925.84] much
[1925.84 → 1926.24] Google
[1926.24 → 1926.98] expects
[1926.98 → 1928.06] that
[1928.06 → 1928.48] given
[1928.48 → 1928.94] user
[1928.94 → 1929.62] to contribute
[1929.62 → 1930.26] directly to
[1930.26 → 1930.64] their bottom
[1930.64 → 1930.96] line
[1930.96 → 1931.72] or if it's
[1931.72 → 1932.18] just kind
[1932.18 → 1932.34] of an
[1932.34 → 1932.68] FM
[1932.68 → 1933.10] and it's
[1933.10 → 1933.34] the
[1933.34 → 1934.12] and $250
[1934.12 → 1934.94] is closer
[1934.94 → 1935.20] to what
[1935.20 → 1935.44] they would
[1935.44 → 1935.88] expect to
[1935.88 → 1936.12] make
[1936.12 → 1936.82] no I
[1936.82 → 1937.24] think that
[1937.24 → 1938.40] the fees
[1938.40 → 1939.98] are to
[1939.98 → 1941.12] they're
[1941.12 → 1942.64] geared toward
[1942.64 → 1943.54] increasing
[1943.54 → 1944.18] Android's
[1944.18 → 1944.62] penetration
[1944.62 → 1945.02] in those
[1945.02 → 1945.36] markets
[1945.36 → 1945.70] so I
[1945.70 → 1946.40] think that
[1946.40 → 1947.48] the user
[1947.48 → 1947.92] in India
[1947.92 → 1948.30] they just
[1948.30 → 1948.72] want their
[1948.72 → 1949.26] devices in
[1949.26 → 1949.50] India
[1949.50 → 1950.28] so they're
[1950.28 → 1950.46] just
[1950.46 → 1952.06] maybe they're
[1952.06 → 1952.52] saturated
[1952.52 → 1953.12] in UK
[1953.12 → 1953.74] and Netherlands
[1953.74 → 1954.82] right so maybe
[1954.82 → 1955.14] they just
[1955.14 → 1955.76] don't really
[1955.76 → 1956.28] care at that
[1956.28 → 1956.56] point
[1956.56 → 1958.96] I'd really
[1958.96 → 1959.42] like to
[1959.42 → 1959.66] know
[1959.66 → 1960.06] I mean
[1960.06 → 1960.56] can you
[1960.56 → 1961.18] imagine
[1961.18 → 1962.12] like let's
[1962.12 → 1962.80] kind of
[1962.80 → 1963.48] like imagination
[1963.48 → 1964.40] craft for a
[1964.40 → 1964.78] second here
[1964.78 → 1965.42] can you imagine
[1965.42 → 1965.92] if this had
[1965.92 → 1966.36] happened
[1966.36 → 1967.48] back when
[1967.48 → 1968.44] Microsoft was
[1968.44 → 1968.98] still in the
[1968.98 → 1969.36] game with
[1969.36 → 1969.90] Windows phone
[1969.90 → 1971.36] because that
[1971.36 → 1971.86] was one of
[1971.86 → 1972.50] Microsoft's
[1972.50 → 1973.40] big disadvantages
[1973.40 → 1973.98] is they were
[1973.98 → 1974.94] charging for
[1974.94 → 1975.44] the operating
[1975.44 → 1975.88] system
[1975.88 → 1976.80] well now
[1976.80 → 1977.70] Google is
[1977.70 → 1978.20] being put in
[1978.20 → 1978.70] the position
[1978.70 → 1979.16] where they
[1979.16 → 1979.78] have to
[1979.78 → 1980.34] charge for
[1980.34 → 1980.88] the operating
[1980.88 → 1981.30] system
[1981.30 → 1983.24] it levels
[1983.24 → 1983.68] the playing
[1983.68 → 1984.26] field because
[1984.26 → 1985.06] Apple has to
[1985.06 → 1985.44] charge for
[1985.44 → 1985.88] the operating
[1985.88 → 1986.26] system
[1986.26 → 1987.26] you have to
[1987.26 → 1987.60] cover your
[1987.60 → 1988.20] costs somehow
[1988.20 → 1988.84] so you
[1988.84 → 1989.50] either cover
[1989.50 → 1989.96] your costs
[1989.96 → 1990.70] through advertising
[1990.70 → 1991.34] and subsidies
[1991.34 → 1992.12] through your
[1992.12 → 1992.96] marketplace or
[1992.96 → 1993.44] your play store
[1993.44 → 1993.84] or app store
[1993.84 → 1994.28] whatever you want
[1994.28 → 1994.72] to call it
[1994.72 → 1995.88] or you
[1995.88 → 1996.36] charge for
[1996.36 → 1997.42] it by
[1997.42 → 1998.10] charging for
[1998.10 → 1998.52] it you have
[1998.52 → 1998.80] to pay
[1998.80 → 1999.54] software developers
[1999.54 → 2000.02] they aren't
[2000.02 → 2000.40] free at
[2000.40 → 2000.88] tech deals
[2000.88 → 2001.84] sent a
[2001.84 → 2002.56] super chat
[2002.56 → 2002.94] here he's
[2002.94 → 2004.00] like free
[2004.00 → 2004.62] software isn't
[2004.62 → 2005.34] free film at
[2005.34 → 2006.42] 11 like yeah
[2006.42 → 2008.10] exactly what I
[2008.10 → 2008.56] think is really
[2008.56 → 2009.20] interesting is the
[2009.20 → 2010.14] fact that Android
[2010.14 → 2010.84] is open source
[2010.84 → 2012.76] but we kind
[2012.76 → 2013.50] of feel entitled
[2013.50 → 2014.04] to the things that
[2014.04 → 2014.60] should come with
[2014.60 → 2015.38] Android like the
[2015.38 → 2015.92] Play Store you
[2015.92 → 2016.46] think that's an
[2016.46 → 2017.48] integral part of
[2017.48 → 2018.40] Android, but it's
[2018.40 → 2019.28] not it's a
[2019.28 → 2020.46] Google service
[2020.46 → 2021.68] just like Chrome
[2021.68 → 2022.28] and search and
[2022.28 → 2022.74] maps and all
[2022.74 → 2023.20] that and that's
[2023.20 → 2023.76] what we found out
[2023.76 → 2024.54] with this unbundling
[2024.54 → 2026.28] Huzzah Gamers
[2026.28 → 2027.26] says first super
[2027.26 → 2029.00] chat please

[2031.34 → 2032.18] turned it up I
[2032.18 → 2032.70] don't know if it
[2032.70 → 2032.96] helped
[2032.96 → 2034.54] is that better

[2056.96 → 2058.02] insignificant amount of
[2058.02 → 2058.70] work like it's really

[2067.64 → 2068.68] mini you can check it
[2068.68 → 2069.94] out at the links below
[2069.94 → 2071.60] the archive
[2071.60 → 2074.34] so it allows you to
[2074.34 → 2075.12] concentrate on your
[2075.12 → 2076.16] stream instead of
[2076.16 → 2076.78] trying to memorize
[2076.78 → 2077.88] keyboard shortcuts
[2077.88 → 2078.80] one touch operation
[2078.80 → 2079.78] means that you can
[2079.78 → 2080.48] start your stream
[2080.48 → 2081.56] announce your live
[2081.56 → 2082.76] play animations and
[2082.76 → 2083.68] more without ever
[2083.68 → 2084.34] having to take your
[2084.34 → 2085.18] eyes off the action
[2085.18 → 2086.58] uh with a total of
[2086.58 → 2088.18] six LCD keys do I
[2088.18 → 2089.06] have one on me I
[2089.06 → 2089.84] wish I had one on me
[2089.84 → 2090.42] that I could show you
[2090.42 → 2091.08] guys whatever Taryn
[2091.08 → 2092.04] loves these things so
[2092.04 → 2092.68] they're these little
[2092.68 → 2094.22] like tiny mini keyboards
[2094.22 → 2095.12] they have so these the
[2095.12 → 2095.92] mini has six
[2095.92 → 2097.20] keys, and they've all
[2097.20 → 2098.38] got a screen on them
[2098.38 → 2099.64] so you can put uh
[2099.64 → 2100.58] icons on them that
[2100.58 → 2102.06] are totally representative
[2102.06 → 2103.44] of what kind of action
[2103.44 → 2104.50] they execute it's really
[2104.50 → 2105.38] cool, and you can change
[2105.38 → 2106.04] them to whatever you
[2106.04 → 2107.72] want and oh that's
[2107.72 → 2108.86] that's funny my next
[2108.86 → 2109.66] note is that it's not
[2109.66 → 2110.76] just for streamers uh
[2110.76 → 2111.40] one of our editors
[2111.40 → 2112.74] Taryn has two of the
[2112.74 → 2113.70] bigger stream decks on
[2113.70 → 2114.50] his desk, and he's had
[2114.50 → 2115.94] them there for it's
[2115.94 → 2116.74] going to be over a year
[2116.74 → 2117.82] now that's a huge deck
[2117.82 → 2119.08] yeah he uses them for
[2119.08 → 2120.34] macros for Adobe Premiere
[2120.34 → 2121.56] so they're available for
[2121.56 → 2122.60] mac or windows and
[2122.60 → 2123.20] they're less than a
[2123.20 → 2124.12] hundred bucks so learn

[2313.32 → 2313.98] do you think what's the most
[2313.98 → 2315.62] important most important oh mean
[2315.62 → 2317.72] tax that's our headline topic it's
[2317.72 → 2318.84] like right in the thumbnail we have to
[2318.84 → 2320.68] do it okay then, so this was posted by
[2320.68 → 2323.60] RC mail on the forum and basically
[2323.60 → 2325.50] the EU's new copyright directive
[2325.50 → 2327.40] known as article 13 a lot of people
[2327.40 → 2330.06] were criticizing the episode of tech
[2330.06 → 2332.16] linked this week when I was raging
[2332.16 → 2334.72] out about this saying too little too
[2334.72 → 2336.30] late you guys you should have covered
[2336.30 → 2337.48] it before and I'm kind of sitting
[2337.48 → 2339.08] here going well I didn't think this
[2339.08 → 2342.02] was going to go through, and we have we
[2342.02 → 2344.08] have had coverage on this over quite
[2344.08 → 2346.76] some time and also as if it matters
[2346.76 → 2349.62] we're not even in the EU well I mean
[2349.62 → 2350.92] it's going to affect us so let's talk
[2350.92 → 2352.22] let's talk about our no, no i just
[2352.22 → 2354.36] mean like how much sway like
[2354.36 → 2356.02] oh are we that important no we're not
[2356.02 → 2359.16] um but at least we can try to
[2359.16 → 2360.76] make some noise now because even though
[2360.76 → 2362.44] three hundred dollars it has passed the
[2362.44 → 2365.52] first vote I should hope not uh no it's
[2365.52 → 2367.10] three hundred whatever an is
[2367.10 → 2368.44] uh
[2368.44 → 2373.86] a that's not Australian is it
[2373.86 → 2375.62] that would probably be like an of I don't
[2375.62 → 2377.54] know it doesn't yeah I think it's an u for
[2377.54 → 2380.32] so there's no real there's no real new
[2380.32 → 2382.42] news the only new news about this is
[2382.42 → 2386.04] that the YouTube CEO published a blog
[2386.04 → 2388.60] post an open letter um just talking
[2388.60 → 2389.76] about how it's going to affect their
[2389.76 → 2391.90] service and how dramatic the changes
[2391.90 → 2393.86] could be should this can you know
[2393.86 → 2396.34] continue so just as an update on the
[2396.34 → 2398.80] situation the first round of voting has
[2398.80 → 2401.52] gone has come and gone, and it passed and
[2401.52 → 2403.96] I don't believe that they have ever had
[2403.96 → 2406.86] something fail to pass at the second
[2406.86 → 2408.82] round of voting that did pass the first
[2408.82 → 2413.06] round so we are really on the verge of
[2413.06 → 2416.24] making platforms responsible not just
[2416.24 → 2419.56] responsible but also liable for the
[2419.56 → 2422.32] content that is on their websites to put
[2422.32 → 2425.76] this in context now it does specify that
[2425.76 → 2428.04] it's major platforms or whatever the case
[2428.04 → 2433.58] may be, but there's I major platforms are kind of
[2433.58 → 2436.48] important i it's probably quantified I don't
[2436.48 → 2438.38] know exactly how they're quantifying it but i
[2438.38 → 2440.38] still think it's important because flow plane's
[2440.38 → 2444.60] pretty major I mean pretty big deal this has the
[2444.60 → 2447.42] potential to impact even something like Linus
[2447.42 → 2450.38] tech tips dot com forum like it was a number of
[2450.38 → 2453.08] years ago now, but they're like there are things that
[2453.08 → 2456.46] already work like this so back when um back when we were
[2456.46 → 2459.94] still using AdSense for Linus tech tips dot com not
[2459.94 → 2462.46] that it is like ever made a ton of money or anything so it
[2462.46 → 2465.04] wasn't a big deal, but we had a post your desktop
[2465.04 → 2469.30] wallpaper thread that was like many dozens and
[2469.30 → 2472.34] dozens I think it was hundreds of pages long like
[2472.34 → 2473.64] because everyone would just post their desktop
[2473.64 → 2477.74] wallpapers and some people's desktop wallpapers
[2477.74 → 2482.92] are their home not their work desktop because they
[2482.92 → 2486.18] wouldn't be safe for work, and so we ended up with some
[2486.18 → 2489.90] pretty racy images on the forum and quite frankly like
[2489.90 → 2492.80] post your desktop wallpaper threads are the kind of
[2492.80 → 2495.68] thing that doesn't typically get moderated very actively
[2495.68 → 2500.16] so what happened was we ended up with some content on
[2500.16 → 2504.76] the website that google deemed to be contrary to their
[2504.76 → 2508.04] restrictions for Google Adsense, and they cut us off and they
[2508.04 → 2511.78] said you guys need to get your site back in line before we
[2511.78 → 2514.68] will turn it back on and you guys are responsible for scouring
[2514.68 → 2516.74] your website making sure there's nothing on it, we kind of went
[2516.74 → 2522.02] we have literally thousands of posts a day of user generated
[2522.02 → 2526.14] content like this is not feasible to actually filter through
[2526.14 → 2529.24] every freaking post and make sure that we don't have any hate
[2529.24 → 2534.04] speech or any nudity or any graphic violence or whatever the
[2534.04 → 2536.78] case may be like we do our best, but we rely on our community to flag
[2536.78 → 2539.80] things and a lot of the time the community will go like that's not a
[2539.80 → 2542.74] big deal and Google will go whoa holy crap that's terrible
[2542.74 → 2547.68] so I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's unlikely that something like
[2547.68 → 2551.56] Linus tech tips' forum would actually be affected by article 13 because it's
[2551.56 → 2554.10] pretty small fish and so would something like float plane be
[2554.10 → 2558.88] but the problem is that everything small if it's good
[2558.88 → 2565.96] will grow and this situation where the platform has to be responsible
[2565.96 → 2568.94] ultimately we got our AdSense revoked, and we never got it back in case you
[2568.94 → 2570.30] guys are wondering how that story ends
[2570.30 → 2577.16] this situation is ultimately untenable because with the amount of user
[2577.16 → 2581.74] generated content that someone like a YouTube or Facebook or even Linus
[2581.74 → 2588.30] tech tips dot com forum is receiving you would have to hire so many staff members just to
[2588.30 → 2594.82] sit with like their eyeballs their eyelids stapled to the tops and
[2594.82 → 2599.36] bottoms of their eyes staring at their screens watching it come in the number of
[2599.36 → 2603.40] people you'd have to pay to do that would be it would be unmanageable you would
[2603.40 → 2609.08] never be able to have an online platform that can just accept any user uploaded
[2609.08 → 2614.40] content willy-nilly that's what I'm trying to say is that even though we might
[2614.40 → 2619.66] not be affected by this in terms of the platforms that we run we have been in this
[2619.66 → 2627.60] situation, and it's not feasible so the quote from this blog post yes she
[2627.60 → 2632.88] says it would be too risky for platforms to host content from smaller original
[2632.88 → 2636.82] content creators because the platform would now be directly liable for that
[2636.82 → 2642.16] content the proposal could force platforms like YouTube to allow only
[2642.16 → 2647.04] content from a few large companies so basically what she's saying
[2647.04 → 2651.22] and so you're basically going back to cable she clarifies things further later
[2651.22 → 2655.56] like I think uh she's saying like there are possibilities that they could
[2655.56 → 2660.76] prevent EU users from accessing non-U content, or they could uh prevent
[2660.76 → 2665.70] like there 's's ways that maybe they could geo-fence it or whatever the
[2665.70 → 2670.04] case may be but ultimately yeah it's like going back to the Stone Age like
[2670.04 → 2675.24] we've had YouTube the way it is user generated content video content like it's
[2675.24 → 2680.82] amazing for over 10 years now and to go back to not being able to just
[2680.82 → 2685.62] have anyone upload any stupid dog video and maybe go viral, and maybe you know make a
[2685.62 → 2690.32] couple thousand bucks or whatever like to take away that or upload a video of them
[2690.32 → 2694.16] reviewing a laptop in their kitchen then maybe one day employ 22 people and
[2694.16 → 2702.14] so that's that's something that really upsets me is that there's a lot more to YouTube now than just
[2702.14 → 2708.16] the user generated content even because we i sincerely doubt would be big enough to qualify
[2708.16 → 2713.86] as a few large companies there's just no way like they couldn't possibly manage
[2713.86 → 2719.36] everyone our size on the platform I don't think it makes any sense because remember guys we're not
[2719.36 → 2725.28] like monitoring video content is not the same as even something like a forum where you can kind of
[2725.28 → 2731.76] skim images yeah it looks fine you have to watch the video it's nice you can't really just depend on the
[2731.76 → 2738.06] machines to do this, and you can't there's no way even google is basically admitting we can't do it
[2738.06 → 2744.22] and if they can't do it I don't think anyone else is in a position to go say with 100 confidence
[2744.22 → 2750.12] that they'd be comfortable with it so this could affect us in a huge way, and it's not just
[2750.12 → 2757.72] me personally but the YouTube ecosystem props up hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of
[2757.72 → 2764.42] thousands of people's actual livelihoods now like it's not just the indie YouTubers who are
[2764.42 → 2768.86] who have managed to go independent and managed to support themselves, but there are reasonable
[2768.86 → 2775.90] sized enterprises like again so we employ between Linus media group and float plane 26 or 27 people
[2775.90 → 2782.04] like it's at the point now where I've lost track which is your know really cool but also terrifying
[2782.04 → 2787.66] because if all of a sudden we were cut off from our European viewership that could significantly
[2787.66 → 2793.20] impact us like we've taken a very conservative approach to growing our business, and we've kept our
[2793.20 → 2797.82] costs under control my commitment to you right now jams is even if all of our European viewership
[2797.82 → 2804.80] goes away tomorrow night your job will be safe and so will everyone's here, but other people might be
[2804.80 → 2811.78] riding the razor's edge a little tighter, or they might be in a really vulnerable state right now
[2811.78 → 2816.72] where maybe I think a great example would be tech deals as one of the guys on float plane
[2816.72 → 2821.62] right now he sent a super chat earlier, so tech deals just obtained a new studio space
[2821.62 → 2827.70] what if he took a 20 hit to his income right now yeah his most vulnerable time at his most
[2827.70 → 2833.02] vulnerable time like this was ultimately why Linus media group went on vessel because we had just
[2833.02 → 2839.24] obtained a new space just hired some people we were looking to expand, and then it was YouTube
[2839.24 → 2844.26] that time but YouTube released this memo saying that we weren't going to be able to monetize our
[2844.26 → 2847.58] videos through third parties the way that we'd been doing up till then we were like holy crap are they
[2847.58 → 2852.48] just going to like rip all our videos down what are we going to do um and I think there's going to be
[2852.48 → 2857.40] a lot of people panicking like this so should we be freaking out yes and then there's all these other
[2857.40 → 2862.66] applications like we just had a municipal election in Vancouver or in the whole region what about all
[2862.66 → 2868.48] those random city councilor people who just wanted to tell the constituents their little platform
[2868.48 → 2874.88] boom it goes on YouTube where are they going to put that like Squarespace like YouTube is actually
[2874.88 → 2880.76] kind of public service in a lot of ways and there are things that obviously we can see about it
[2880.76 → 2886.76] that are clearly not public service type things like the way that they moderate the content or the
[2886.76 → 2894.38] way that you know Apocalypse affected some people disproportionately compared to others, but it does still have a role
[2894.38 → 2901.36] in that space, and it would be a huge loss to not have it anymore I mean you look too at the way that um
[2901.36 → 2905.88] the way that protesters or activists can use YouTube to get a message out
[2905.88 → 2913.68] so that's that's where I was going this is really, really important and I mean like I said i I hadn't
[2913.68 → 2919.40] taken it seriously enough before because I just thought that people were going to realize that this is
[2919.40 → 2924.10] obviously not sustainable and can it at some point I guess we didn't get there
[2924.10 → 2930.64] well what about the argument that it's its maybe if you think of the worst ways
[2930.64 → 2935.42] these laws can be interpreted it would just totally ruin the internet but then if they
[2935.42 → 2941.86] actually just go ahead with a kind of light touch then it won't be that bad the issue though is
[2941.86 → 2948.52] that it's a question of liability, so platforms are already responsible for the content that users post
[2948.52 → 2953.82] on them um that's the whole point of DMCA where if there's a copyright infringement you are responsible
[2953.82 → 2959.86] for having a way to get in touch with you and having someone review those requests in a timely
[2959.86 → 2965.10] manner and then removing the content that's the way it works now and I understand that there are
[2965.10 → 2968.70] problems with that because you end up with a lot of copyrighted content that just never gets pulled
[2968.70 → 2975.12] down because you don't have enough manpower to go through all these videos innocent until proven guilty
[2975.12 → 2980.72] yes um whereas this new way is just going to kind of assume that everyone's a filthy pirate and is
[2980.72 → 2986.72] uploading you know uh copyrighted material until they prove that they didn't by becoming a large
[2986.72 → 2994.96] company so are you going to New York this weekend yeah when are you going uh I don't remember exactly
[2994.96 → 3003.50] this is like a hybrid between a news topic and just like what do you do it oh because there's a
[3003.50 → 3009.64] lioness is going to the one plus 6t event in New York which is on Monday this is funny, and it's only on
[3009.64 → 3015.74] Monday because apple decided uh we should probably have a second event because no one cared about our
[3015.74 → 3021.20] stuff, and then they scheduled their second event for the same day one plus was scheduled the one plus
[3021.20 → 3029.98] is just bumping a day earlier this is exactly and I blame apple for this is exactly why I've gotten
[3029.98 → 3036.62] so annoyed with this trend where every company needs to have their own little song and
[3036.62 → 3043.86] dance and stage and music and blah blah blah every time they launch a stupid product and to be clear
[3043.86 → 3047.60] I'm not saying the products are always stupid sometimes they're amazing, but it's frustrating
[3047.60 → 3050.80] because it used to be that you could go to one place, and you could see all the announcements
[3050.80 → 3060.28] or at least a handful of places if as long as you hit like computer us um and like you know maybe i
[3060.28 → 3067.98] don't know game com uh um oh what's the big game North America e3 yeah like as long as you hit kind
[3067.98 → 3072.94] of the main big ones and then maybe a couple smaller niche ones and then apple was different what's the
[3072.94 → 3079.70] film industry one I don't know, but there are you talking about the uh graph graphics or no
[3079.70 → 3085.10] s graph I'm taking an s graph not s graph um regardless apple was thinking differently and
[3085.10 → 3091.56] then they pioneered the whole like we're going to have our own keynote thing nab yeah, and it worked
[3091.56 → 3096.12] and it worked and then all the me too companies were like hey we have flagships that are competitive
[3096.12 → 3101.10] I mean now even intel's doing it they launch a CPU they've got an event in New York and everybody's
[3101.10 → 3107.46] got a jet into New York, and we're gonna talk about our CPU in New York, and it's like ah it's kind of
[3107.46 → 3112.82] cool, but there's just too many companies and then yes people if it was a handful of times a year
[3112.82 → 3118.84] I love New York cool city I don't need to go there half a dozen times in a calendar year
[3118.84 → 3124.24] just to see whatever or if the event's in China yeah or if the event's in China which I have
[3124.24 → 3133.78] you've got Samsung Microsoft one plus apple NVIDIA intel like there are six companies if each of those six
[3133.78 → 3138.34] companies launches two products a year you are travelling at least once a month and the thing
[3138.34 → 3143.42] about these trips and these events is that they're structured in such a way that actually
[3143.42 → 3149.74] you're going to see for my one plus video I love the way that they've done it so to be clear a lot of
[3149.74 → 3154.52] this ranting is not necessarily directed at one plus but if each of them launches just two products
[3154.52 → 3158.38] a year you're travelling once a month and the problem with these events is the way that they're
[3158.38 → 3164.44] structured is such that you don't really get any useful insight into the product that you couldn't
[3164.44 → 3170.90] have gotten from just like watching the verges recap yeah watching the hashtag on Twitter yeah and
[3170.90 → 3175.72] kind of looking at some of the commentary yeah okay I got the gist of it and that takes 20 minutes
[3175.72 → 3182.78] whereas getting in a plane flying somewhere waiting in line sitting in the auditorium playing with your
[3182.78 → 3189.20] like goofy bracelet that flashes every time Samsung employees say something amazing or whatever
[3189.20 → 3195.66] it's very time-consuming and I have a life and then you have to do the coverage on the show floor
[3195.66 → 3200.96] where the audio sucks its stressful the audio sucks the video sucks the internet connection sucks there's
[3200.96 → 3206.70] people all around some of them smell not that I'm generalizing about the tech industry but like
[3206.70 → 3212.74] a disproportionate number of them smell like I don't know man it's just it's rough and I'm
[3212.74 → 3217.92] not to be clear I have the greatest job in the world I will, I would never complain about my job
[3217.92 → 3223.10] it's just that there are frustrating things that I feel could be done better it's constructive
[3223.10 → 3229.40] criticism take it that way do you think that one plus benefits from the fact that apple bumped them
[3229.40 → 3235.66] because now they got another wave of media and a bunch of articles about them, I have no idea I don't
[3235.66 → 3240.76] know if it makes it better or worse do you think that apple always planned to have two events yes
[3240.76 → 3245.04] I think that apple probably plans their events a year in advance
[3245.04 → 3255.52] we should do a couple super chats before we uh before we uh go here okay uh oh wow there's so
[3255.52 → 3260.28] many of them I don't know if I will get to them all uh serrated will the EU ruling affect twitch
[3260.28 → 3265.48] I would think so uh in fact I could see it affecting twitch more than someone like YouTube
[3265.48 → 3270.14] but it's streaming that's really weird yeah it's impossible it's like actually impossible well would
[3270.14 → 3275.48] they would the streamers have to agree to terms of service that well I'm sure they already do
[3275.48 → 3280.38] obviously but like the liability would pass through to them or something I have no idea or like just
[3280.38 → 3284.94] promise you won't swear right I never finished that thought before the issue is the liability the
[3284.94 → 3291.30] issue is that even if it's a light touch enforcement of it if the platform is liable versus just being
[3291.30 → 3298.44] able to respond to DMCA takedowns and go okay we did our job then you know if someone like um you know
[3298.44 → 3305.88] universe Disney okay let's take a litigious company like Disney were to go okay the damages of that
[3305.88 → 3313.08] movie rip being up there for 48 hours were a billion dollars all of a sudden YouTube's on the hook for
[3313.08 → 3318.84] that and Disney can go after them directly it's a big problem well unless I guess unless the judge
[3318.84 → 3324.54] was like look it looks like they did their best yeah but then yes, but you don't want the
[3324.54 → 3330.44] law to be if you take that risk yeah do you leave it up to the I wouldn't, I'd be like nope forget it
[3331.10 → 3338.02] uh fend shout out from France hi bongo Anika says newsflash line is people smell here's some money
[3338.02 → 3342.54] for a good air freshener I can't carry an air freshener around with me uh Daniel says testing to see
[3342.54 → 3347.22] what letters show up for Aussies it is a that was 300 Australian dollars which I think is about
[3347.22 → 3353.00] equivalent to Canadian rupees holy crap wow thank you did you even read out the I'm getting to it, I'm
[3353.00 → 3358.72] getting to it uh Nikolai says uh super chat number six come back after the stream and check out Linus's
[3358.72 → 3363.08] serious face during the EU YouTube talk that's a serious line yeah the eyeliner actually helps a
[3363.08 → 3368.78] little bit I think does it make me look more serious I don't know no I mean I don't know does it
[3368.78 → 3373.50] make me look more like a magician definitely okay it kind of just make yeah it makes you look like a
[3373.50 → 3379.40] worn-out rock star like when you see like Robert plant when he's 50 and just haggard like oh stop
[3379.40 → 3386.52] make your Wikipedia picture an old one I don't want to see you like this um Paul says here's a pound
[3386.52 → 3394.82] thanks Paul taco preacher says here's a hundred Mexican pesos thank you taco preacher I didn't even
[3394.82 → 3403.20] catch that uh tech support josh um contact me I have some ideas uh that's very vague i probably
[3403.20 → 3407.60] okay the kinds of ideas that I've gotten from people on the internet you'll have to forgive me josh
[3407.60 → 3414.56] but i probably won't be uh, uh Jamie says so if article 13 rolls around do you fancy a British
[3414.56 → 3419.56] migrant um only if you can get a work permit and your skills happen to align perfectly with what
[3419.56 → 3423.22] we're looking for at that time we're not hiring right now Brian says love hearing your insight
[3423.22 → 3427.84] about what affects pricing in the tech industry yep I like British accents so we should have more
[3427.84 → 3435.46] here or Irish how much more credible would I sound with a British accent 10x yeah I think so um
[3435.46 → 3441.04] DSB says are you going to release the new LTT logo shirts and store okay yes at some point we
[3441.04 → 3446.64] really want to they've been done for ages we're like we're revamping the store completely uh
[3446.64 → 3451.98] chairman says here are some European euros for the European talk hope this doesn't make it so I can't
[3451.98 → 3460.50] watch you guys any more me too goodness okay, so this is the 300 Australian dollars really high density
[3460.50 → 3468.12] potato paid 300 to send this message high density potato really wish I could watch the wan show from
[3468.12 → 3475.72] LNG's amphibious aircraft here's 300 minus the 30 streaming tax towards making it a reality
[3475.72 → 3482.44] hmm so is that the deal have we now entered into a verbal contract where I have to buy an amphibious
[3482.44 → 3488.50] aircraft with it oh float plane wait you didn't get that oh because float plane doesn't do wan shows
[3488.50 → 3492.98] streaming okay yes we will get that working at some point we're actually closer than you probably think
[3492.98 → 3498.16] ah amphibious why is that something that someone would watch I thought he meant that I would stream
[3498.16 → 3502.42] from uh well image quality is better on float plane we could stream at Harvard rate okay like once we
[3502.42 → 3507.46] have it working we should be able to do it so is that it that's one reason that's it for the wan show
[3507.46 → 3513.42] oh I meant is that the only reason but okay bye-bye is there anything that you're particularly upset
[3513.42 → 3522.42] that we didn't cover nope topic sucks this week whose fault is that the world nope you're gone
[3522.42 → 3532.94] actually they can, you know when's the last time you did it together you and I have a long time yeah I don't
[3532.94 → 3539.54] think we haven't even done that I don't know we've done like one or two ever yeah we've done like
[3539.54 → 3544.98] no, no way it would have all been like right around the time
[3544.98 → 3551.70] I got such a kick out of the way that you kind of like snuck into videos even though you weren't
[3551.70 → 3558.18] finished your uh probation, yet you got a kick out of that totally again well you know I got it was cute
[3558.18 → 3564.74] you gave me a shit for it yeah I know yeah well there's what I mean it's like it's like uh it's
[3564.74 → 3570.94] like parents right like they might yell at you about something but then like when you're not
[3570.94 → 3576.12] looking or like when Yvonne's giving one of the kids heck for something and their attention
[3576.12 → 3581.10] is completely focused on her, I can be like oh well what I was like really cute what i what happened
[3581.10 → 3586.66] was other people would need help, and they would ask me like Brandon or max or whatever would be like
[3586.66 → 3592.82] you can you would you like to and I wouldn't say no I wouldn't be like oh I'm not allowed I would be
[3592.82 → 3595.30] like sure guys
