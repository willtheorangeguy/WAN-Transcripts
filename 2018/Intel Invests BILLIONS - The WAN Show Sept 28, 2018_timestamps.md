I thought it, you said it at 9:14 (I'm old idk how to make timestamps, edit: fing hoorah, it does so automatically), my 2500k is still going at 4,5ghz never seen a chip since that felt like really worth the money. Now waiting for Zen 2 next year. Intel is definitely not getting my money that is for sure. Next year ram will be cheaper as well since of course I need to upgrade motherboard, ram and CPU. It's sad enough that my 7/8 year old rig which I upgraded with a r9 fury is still running pretty good. Great that it does, sad because I do want to spend money on something I feel worth it.
