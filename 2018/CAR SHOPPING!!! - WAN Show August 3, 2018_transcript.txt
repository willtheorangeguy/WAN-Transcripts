[0.00 --> 3.48]  So today, I don't think I could handle it right now.
[3.90 --> 4.34]  Oh, okay.
[4.60 --> 7.74]  I have had a fairly terrible last couple of days.
[9.22 --> 13.54]  I have been fighting with my tape drive backup thing
[13.54 --> 16.50]  that basically doesn't work on the PC properly.
[16.92 --> 19.04]  And the guys that make it are like,
[19.32 --> 21.64]  yeah, the truth of the matter is that the driver situation
[21.64 --> 24.14]  from IBM on down just isn't that great on the PC
[24.14 --> 25.30]  and it works better on a Mac.
[25.38 --> 27.48]  So then I've been trying to get a Mac working with 10 gigabit.
[27.48 --> 29.32]  And so I was using the MacBook Pro
[29.32 --> 31.68]  and 10 gigabit LAN to be clear.
[31.76 --> 33.02]  So I was using the MacBook Pro
[33.02 --> 35.44]  and I ran into a...
[35.44 --> 37.30]  Remember when I called you earlier this week?
[37.40 --> 37.58]  Yeah.
[37.66 --> 39.02]  Asking if you had the Core X.
[39.16 --> 39.30]  Yeah.
[39.40 --> 39.56]  Yeah.
[39.66 --> 46.96]  So I managed to have three external PCI Express docks,
[47.44 --> 50.68]  four 10 gigabit network cards,
[51.24 --> 52.46]  a variety of cables,
[53.16 --> 55.76]  and I still couldn't manage to get...
[55.76 --> 57.34]  Like I even got down to the point
[57.34 --> 58.98]  where I had a Thunderbolt chipset
[58.98 --> 60.86]  that Apple hadn't specifically locked out
[60.86 --> 63.10]  because we don't want to support it.
[63.34 --> 63.50]  Yeah.
[63.50 --> 65.70]  I managed to find one that didn't have a Thunderbolt chip
[65.70 --> 66.52]  that was locked out.
[66.64 --> 68.50]  So the enclosure worked on the Mac.
[68.90 --> 70.30]  And I even managed to get
[70.30 --> 73.38]  a 10 gig Ethernet card
[73.38 --> 75.60]  with the exact same chipset
[75.60 --> 77.64]  that is already in use in the iMac Pro.
[77.64 --> 80.30]  But that still doesn't work
[80.30 --> 83.02]  because there's some stupid beta of macOS
[83.02 --> 86.18]  that you have to like update from an older one too.
[86.40 --> 88.08]  And then it will flash cards
[88.08 --> 91.68]  that are not like Mac approved
[91.68 --> 93.12]  to be Mac approved.
[93.28 --> 94.38]  And then they just work
[94.38 --> 97.52]  because the drivers are for the hardware,
[97.82 --> 100.66]  not for like the stupid vendor ID
[100.66 --> 102.14]  that actually doesn't matter.
[102.34 --> 103.82]  But with Apple, it's just...
[103.82 --> 105.68]  Anthony's way of putting it, I think, is great.
[105.74 --> 106.62]  It's magic numbers.
[106.62 --> 109.90]  It's not about whether it should actually work or not.
[109.98 --> 112.64]  It's about making sure it has the right magic number.
[112.88 --> 114.54]  That's actually one of his theories
[114.54 --> 118.10]  about the whole throttling issue with the MacBook Pro.
[118.20 --> 118.72]  Did you see this?
[118.78 --> 119.34]  You hear about this?
[119.40 --> 120.62]  The big thermal throttling thing?
[120.64 --> 121.18]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[121.24 --> 124.20]  And Apple fixes it with a macOS update
[124.20 --> 126.18]  that they said was firmware
[126.18 --> 128.02]  but doesn't seem to be firmware
[128.02 --> 129.66]  because it doesn't fix it in Windows.
[129.92 --> 130.04]  Yeah.
[130.32 --> 134.12]  So it must just be like a magic number.
[134.12 --> 137.58]  Like a magic number detects the CPU correctly now.
[137.64 --> 138.90]  No, it doesn't behave stupidly.
[138.94 --> 139.42]  Oh, good.
[139.84 --> 140.00]  Yeah.
[140.54 --> 143.10]  Thank goodness for a genuine Apple-approved hardware
[143.10 --> 144.44]  and nothing else working at all.
[144.88 --> 145.86]  You want to hear my great story?
[147.12 --> 148.36]  And then, and then,
[148.52 --> 151.32]  I've spent the last four hours dealing with this.
[151.86 --> 153.08]  Do you think it's going to be done by the end of WAN?
[153.08 --> 154.68]  I hope so.
[154.78 --> 155.84]  It's at 84%.
[155.84 --> 157.72]  It was at 54% when I first saw it.
[157.72 --> 158.16]  It was at the third reboot now.
[158.30 --> 159.76]  So I think we're getting close.
[159.86 --> 161.74]  I may duck out of WAN and just finish that video.
[161.82 --> 163.42]  This is the last thing I'm waiting for.
[163.76 --> 166.34]  I just want to run Cinebench!
[167.28 --> 167.68]  Sorry.
[167.80 --> 168.44]  Sorry, everyone.
[168.62 --> 170.14]  I'm just, I'm having a rough day.
[170.42 --> 171.94]  I just want to run Cinebench
[171.94 --> 174.32]  and I can't if Windows Update is sucking back
[174.32 --> 176.24]  25% of the CPU in the background.
[176.74 --> 176.98]  Right.
[177.10 --> 179.58]  I just want to know how much faster it is than last gen
[179.58 --> 182.04]  and I was thinking maybe I'd compare it to the Surface Go
[182.04 --> 183.10]  since that arrived today.
[183.44 --> 184.94]  Tried to live stream the Surface Go.
[185.28 --> 187.50]  Turns out another video project we're working on,
[187.72 --> 189.14]  which is really cool, by the way.
[189.22 --> 190.46]  Basically, we're giving the,
[190.46 --> 192.66]  we're giving the, the this to Google.
[193.12 --> 193.34]  Oh.
[193.40 --> 195.76]  But in a way that's like not just to spite them.
[195.82 --> 198.72]  It's just, we are abusing their services.
[199.46 --> 200.10]  Oh, yeah.
[200.12 --> 200.44]  I know, I know.
[200.44 --> 201.90]  In a way that's really cool.
[203.16 --> 205.34]  Well, it turns out we're also abusing these.
[205.34 --> 206.08]  Fully within the terms.
[206.20 --> 207.76]  Abusing the CPU of our router.
[208.88 --> 209.28]  Oh.
[209.58 --> 210.00]  Yeah.
[210.16 --> 213.96]  So it looks like that killed our stream earlier.
[214.96 --> 216.62]  We, where we literally,
[217.56 --> 222.04]  oh, like overloaded our router CPU.
[222.40 --> 223.76]  And remember, this is not some,
[223.90 --> 225.78]  this isn't some wimpy BS router.
[225.96 --> 226.62]  It's a rack mounted router.
[226.62 --> 227.20]  Yeah, this isn't,
[227.26 --> 229.06]  this is an Edge Router Pro from Ubiquity.
[229.22 --> 229.74]  Oh, okay.
[229.74 --> 230.06]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[230.06 --> 233.02]  Like it's not some $100,000 stupid,
[233.02 --> 234.94]  like Cisco thing or anything like that,
[234.94 --> 240.62]  but it is not an insubstantial piece of networking machinery.
[241.32 --> 243.26]  Um, I love this.
[243.32 --> 243.78]  I love this.
[243.82 --> 245.10]  You sit and wait four hours for it,
[245.10 --> 246.62]  and then it's got this really friendly thing.
[246.68 --> 247.50]  Just hold on for a second.
[247.50 --> 248.98]  We've got some updates for your PC.
[249.08 --> 249.72]  No, no.
[249.84 --> 251.90]  You had updates for my PC four hours ago.
[252.08 --> 253.68]  This might take several minutes.
[253.96 --> 254.24]  Yeah.
[254.46 --> 255.52]  At this point,
[256.26 --> 256.92]  what, Dennis?
[258.92 --> 259.92]  You want to hear my story?
[259.92 --> 261.00]  I need you to hear from my story,
[261.04 --> 262.16]  so I want to get it out before we're done that.
[262.18 --> 263.10]  Should we do the intro first?
[263.24 --> 263.46]  Sure.
[263.68 --> 264.52]  Okay, let's just do,
[264.60 --> 265.78]  whatever, there's tech news,
[265.92 --> 266.32]  Danvide,
[266.96 --> 267.42]  Next Gen,
[267.48 --> 268.64]  Intel roadmap leaks,
[268.76 --> 269.56]  also Google,
[269.64 --> 270.24]  Oh my goodness,
[270.24 --> 272.20]  there's rumors about things.
[272.20 --> 273.42]  Apple's worth a trillion dollars.
[273.54 --> 273.72]  Boom.
[273.82 --> 274.18]  Crazy.
[274.18 --> 289.92]  People are hating on the ubiquity.
[291.14 --> 293.00]  The DMs play haters.
[293.56 --> 295.72]  It's one of those technology categories
[295.72 --> 296.96]  where it's just entirely strong.
[297.06 --> 298.06]  Yeah, it stands greater,
[298.24 --> 298.82]  greater than,
[298.82 --> 299.42]  greater than,
[299.54 --> 299.94]  ubiquity.
[301.68 --> 302.00]  It's,
[302.00 --> 302.62]  it's greater than,
[302.68 --> 303.04]  greater than.
[303.26 --> 303.86]  Oh,
[303.86 --> 305.96]  because you've got Linux fanboys in the mix too.
[306.04 --> 306.20]  No,
[306.28 --> 307.50]  that's free BSD.
[307.72 --> 307.90]  Yeah,
[307.96 --> 308.26]  whatever.
[308.52 --> 308.96]  You know what I mean?
[310.14 --> 310.50]  Um,
[310.60 --> 311.10]  actually,
[311.44 --> 315.88]  Oh gosh.
[316.38 --> 316.66]  Anyways,
[316.78 --> 316.94]  okay,
[317.04 --> 318.58]  so do you remember at the end of last stream,
[318.96 --> 319.88]  how I revealed how I,
[319.88 --> 321.10]  I finally bought a new chair?
[321.82 --> 322.00]  Yeah,
[322.06 --> 322.26]  oh,
[322.30 --> 322.90]  what now?
[324.32 --> 324.72]  What?
[324.72 --> 324.76]  So,
[324.88 --> 326.46]  so the story of my chair is,
[326.58 --> 328.36]  someone sat on the arm,
[328.92 --> 330.54]  and it broke the like,
[330.74 --> 331.44]  middle support.
[331.70 --> 332.48]  So basically,
[332.60 --> 333.78]  my chair was tilted like,
[333.78 --> 335.46]  this for four years.
[335.46 --> 336.78]  In defense of your chair,
[336.98 --> 339.44]  that someone was very likely to break that chair.
[339.56 --> 339.84]  Yes.
[340.12 --> 340.38]  Yep.
[340.76 --> 341.02]  Yep.
[341.24 --> 342.30]  In fairness to your chair.
[342.48 --> 342.66]  Yep.
[342.98 --> 343.38]  I mean,
[343.54 --> 343.68]  I,
[344.24 --> 344.86]  but to like,
[344.96 --> 345.56]  to compensate,
[345.74 --> 347.02]  said I was looking straight at my monitor.
[347.18 --> 349.60]  I basically sat like this for four years.
[349.72 --> 350.76]  And then recently,
[350.76 --> 352.32]  went to physio,
[352.54 --> 353.24]  and he was like,
[353.46 --> 353.94]  wow,
[354.28 --> 355.18]  you need a new chair.
[355.36 --> 355.94]  You're an idiot.
[356.20 --> 356.56]  So,
[356.92 --> 358.72]  I decided to get a new chair,
[359.00 --> 360.12]  did a whole bunch of research,
[360.34 --> 361.06]  took like a month,
[361.06 --> 362.52]  over a month for the chair to show up.
[362.66 --> 363.44]  It's supposed to like,
[363.68 --> 365.60]  keep you in a specific spot,
[365.70 --> 366.64]  so that your spine is like,
[366.68 --> 367.34]  correctly aligned.
[367.50 --> 368.22]  It's not,
[368.22 --> 370.02]  supposed to be super comfortable.
[370.42 --> 371.94]  It's supposed to keep you in the right spot.
[372.00 --> 372.18]  Right.
[372.26 --> 373.12]  It's kind of like,
[373.46 --> 374.52]  a racing chair,
[374.86 --> 375.28]  except,
[375.28 --> 376.78]  not for a car.
[377.18 --> 377.36]  So,
[377.40 --> 378.22]  it actually makes sense.
[378.28 --> 378.40]  So,
[378.46 --> 380.12]  for going fast on your computer.
[380.30 --> 380.58]  Yeah.
[382.08 --> 382.48]  Anyways,
[382.86 --> 383.46]  the expected,
[383.46 --> 386.12]  the expected delivery date,
[386.42 --> 386.98]  was,
[387.58 --> 387.98]  uh,
[388.14 --> 389.12]  August 6th.
[389.54 --> 390.12]  You might notice,
[390.20 --> 391.38]  it is not that day yet.
[391.72 --> 392.78]  I have had the chair,
[392.98 --> 393.68]  for a while.
[394.26 --> 394.70]  Um,
[394.82 --> 395.26]  on,
[395.54 --> 397.10]  I believe the 31st,
[397.10 --> 397.66]  or the 30th,
[397.68 --> 398.76]  I don't remember if it was this Monday,
[398.80 --> 399.32]  or this Tuesday,
[399.68 --> 400.84]  I went out to get some lunch.
[400.84 --> 402.82]  I had finished a relatively major milestone.
[402.96 --> 403.14]  You know,
[403.24 --> 403.60]  I was like,
[403.64 --> 403.88]  you know what,
[403.88 --> 404.20]  I'm gonna,
[404.40 --> 406.52]  I'm gonna reward myself with a booster juice.
[406.74 --> 407.04]  So,
[407.10 --> 407.88]  I decided to go outside,
[407.92 --> 408.50]  and get some boosters.
[408.74 --> 409.68]  That's expensive,
[409.82 --> 410.04]  yo.
[410.44 --> 411.56]  Booster juice is not that cheap.
[411.58 --> 412.68]  It costs as much as a meal,
[412.80 --> 413.76]  but then you have to like,
[413.78 --> 414.06]  It's like $4.
[414.50 --> 414.74]  Yeah.
[414.82 --> 415.14]  Yeah,
[415.18 --> 416.02]  I don't get them that often,
[416.12 --> 416.56]  but I was like,
[416.64 --> 416.96]  yeah,
[417.06 --> 417.32]  I'm gonna,
[417.46 --> 417.76]  this is,
[417.82 --> 418.24]  this is good.
[418.32 --> 418.84]  I was very happy.
[418.84 --> 419.30]  More than $4.
[419.62 --> 420.16]  I was very happy.
[420.22 --> 420.42]  Anyway,
[420.52 --> 421.24]  carry on with your story,
[421.24 --> 422.98]  while I look at booster juices menu.
[423.14 --> 423.84]  It's really expensive.
[424.38 --> 425.36]  I go walk outside,
[425.66 --> 426.48]  as I'm walking outside,
[426.54 --> 426.80]  I was like,
[426.88 --> 427.04]  whoa,
[427.10 --> 429.22]  there's a giant cardboard box in the lawn.
[429.32 --> 429.82]  That's weird.
[430.16 --> 431.10]  And I just keep walking,
[431.24 --> 431.80]  and then I'm like,
[432.08 --> 433.06]  I should probably like,
[433.20 --> 433.98]  bring that inside,
[434.08 --> 434.84]  just in case it's like,
[434.90 --> 435.76]  my upstairs neighbors.
[436.36 --> 436.86]  And I go,
[437.00 --> 437.82]  and I look at it closer,
[437.94 --> 439.08]  and I see Herman Miller,
[439.74 --> 440.80]  plastered on the side of it.
[440.86 --> 441.12]  And I'm like,
[441.66 --> 442.14]  what?
[442.68 --> 443.94]  They just left it on the lawn?
[444.08 --> 445.78]  They just left it on the lawn.
[446.26 --> 447.88]  No notification text message,
[448.04 --> 449.16]  no notification email.
[449.38 --> 450.48]  I had no idea.
[450.72 --> 452.34]  I still have no idea,
[452.34 --> 453.38]  how long it was sitting there.
[453.54 --> 454.28]  When I moved it,
[454.34 --> 455.28]  there was very much,
[455.34 --> 456.46]  an impression in the grass.
[456.68 --> 457.96]  So it had been sitting there for,
[457.96 --> 458.88]  a while,
[459.62 --> 460.72]  possibly all night,
[461.02 --> 462.72]  because sometimes I don't leave my house for a while.
[463.28 --> 465.74]  So I have no clue how long it was there.
[466.88 --> 468.02]  Super expensive chair,
[468.24 --> 469.80]  big logo on the side of the box,
[469.98 --> 471.30]  just left in the front lawn,
[471.70 --> 472.88]  for who knows how long.
[472.94 --> 473.94]  No notification that it was there,
[474.14 --> 474.34]  nothing.
[474.42 --> 474.96]  They didn't knock,
[475.14 --> 475.82]  they didn't leave a notice,
[476.12 --> 476.38]  they didn't,
[476.78 --> 477.36]  nothing happened.
[478.12 --> 479.78]  So I'm immediately pissed off.
[480.76 --> 482.52]  I bring it inside,
[482.92 --> 483.92]  I go get my food,
[484.00 --> 484.52]  I come back,
[484.74 --> 485.62]  I go to open it.
[485.86 --> 486.36]  First of all,
[486.36 --> 486.90]  there's like,
[487.18 --> 488.70]  it's the worst cardboard box,
[489.38 --> 490.08]  as the outer shell,
[490.16 --> 491.02]  that I've like ever seen.
[491.44 --> 492.62]  And there's like rips,
[492.80 --> 493.82]  where the handles were,
[493.92 --> 494.86]  because the guy's handling it.
[494.90 --> 495.10]  And like,
[495.12 --> 495.98]  I don't even blame them,
[496.36 --> 497.70]  because if you try to pick it up,
[497.74 --> 498.26]  it just rips,
[498.46 --> 499.70]  because it's just a terrible cardboard box.
[499.88 --> 499.96]  Right.
[500.04 --> 500.84]  But I'm thinking in my head like,
[500.92 --> 501.04]  oh,
[501.14 --> 503.12]  there'll be an internal carton,
[503.16 --> 503.28]  right?
[503.28 --> 503.74]  No big deal.
[503.94 --> 504.62]  I open that up,
[504.80 --> 505.02]  nope.
[505.32 --> 506.92]  Not only is there no internal carton,
[506.98 --> 508.82]  that is literally the entire box for the chair,
[508.96 --> 511.18]  there's also zero packing foam,
[511.32 --> 513.64]  or protection of any form at all,
[513.64 --> 514.66]  in the entire box.
[514.66 --> 515.88]  So it's just the chair,
[516.08 --> 516.82]  just sitting there.
[516.82 --> 517.34]  Just rattling around in the box.
[517.34 --> 519.12]  I was able to turn it around,
[519.34 --> 521.02]  while it was inside the box,
[521.20 --> 522.74]  just because I wanted to kind of,
[523.00 --> 523.58]  try it out,
[523.62 --> 524.36]  and see how it goes.
[525.22 --> 525.52]  Like,
[525.54 --> 527.60]  it was actually the worst unboxing experience,
[527.70 --> 528.66]  that I have ever had.
[529.12 --> 530.08]  That same day,
[530.14 --> 530.44]  I like,
[530.52 --> 531.82]  opened up a box for a mouse,
[531.92 --> 532.34]  and was like,
[532.42 --> 532.62]  wow,
[532.74 --> 534.30]  this is a way better experience,
[534.44 --> 535.48]  than the ludicrously,
[536.20 --> 536.94]  obscenely,
[537.48 --> 538.80]  illogically expensive chair,
[538.92 --> 539.60]  that I just bought.
[539.60 --> 542.44]  I was so mad.
[542.72 --> 543.94]  It's fine.
[544.22 --> 544.68]  It like,
[544.76 --> 546.22]  creaks when you move around.
[546.68 --> 548.46]  It's mostly made out of plastic.
[549.08 --> 549.22]  Like,
[549.28 --> 550.08]  it's really,
[550.90 --> 551.16]  like,
[551.24 --> 553.04]  the ergonomic chair market,
[553.28 --> 554.20]  is insane.
[554.54 --> 554.76]  Like,
[554.88 --> 556.22]  if we want to open another business,
[556.28 --> 558.04]  we should just make ergonomic chairs.
[558.28 --> 559.20]  Because you can just charge,
[559.38 --> 560.34]  a billion percent,
[560.78 --> 562.00]  on what it costs to make it.
[562.08 --> 562.28]  Yeah.
[562.46 --> 563.96]  And everyone's just clamoring all over you,
[563.98 --> 565.80]  because they're all generally terrible.
[566.02 --> 567.78]  It also doesn't really feel that great.
[568.40 --> 568.64]  Like,
[568.70 --> 568.88]  it's,
[568.98 --> 569.62]  it's okay.
[569.78 --> 569.90]  Right,
[569.92 --> 570.70]  but it's not supposed to.
[570.70 --> 571.00]  That's,
[571.14 --> 571.48]  yeah,
[571.62 --> 571.82]  okay,
[571.92 --> 572.44]  so yes.
[572.54 --> 574.50]  That seems like a really smart sales pitch.
[574.50 --> 574.66]  Oh,
[574.68 --> 575.92]  it's a brilliant sales pitch.
[575.94 --> 576.82]  It doesn't have to feel good.
[576.86 --> 577.38]  It's ergonomic.
[577.98 --> 580.14]  So it holds me in a relatively good position.
[580.46 --> 581.82]  So I'm probably going to end up keeping it,
[581.88 --> 582.96]  because it'll be good for my spine.
[583.22 --> 583.46]  Okay,
[583.64 --> 584.28]  sounds good.
[585.00 --> 586.38]  The doctor dude says,
[586.48 --> 586.72]  I like,
[586.80 --> 588.44]  really need to do something about that,
[588.78 --> 589.88]  because my spine's getting all weird,
[589.94 --> 591.24]  because I sit like this all the time.
[591.52 --> 591.92]  So yeah,
[591.92 --> 592.52]  sounds good.
[592.64 --> 592.82]  Okay,
[592.92 --> 593.52]  let's do it up.
[593.52 --> 594.26]  You think you sit like this all the time?
[594.28 --> 594.48]  Yeah,
[594.56 --> 594.76]  like,
[594.86 --> 596.88]  so,
[597.28 --> 597.52]  okay,
[597.56 --> 598.60]  I'm probably going to keep it,
[598.68 --> 600.10]  except like the,
[600.14 --> 601.30]  the base isn't foam,
[601.44 --> 602.22]  which is kind of cool,
[602.22 --> 603.06]  because it's breathable,
[603.22 --> 605.16]  but they use these plasticky spring things,
[605.28 --> 607.04]  and that's great in most areas,
[607.14 --> 609.24]  except for where the reinforced bar is.
[609.80 --> 610.20]  Right.
[610.22 --> 610.66]  And you can like,
[610.80 --> 611.96]  super feel this bar,
[612.20 --> 613.78]  that is just under you all the time.
[613.80 --> 615.36]  Have you tried the OM5?
[616.12 --> 616.92]  Is this the,
[617.00 --> 617.42]  uh,
[617.86 --> 619.22]  we had like an orangey one?
[619.24 --> 619.44]  Yeah,
[619.48 --> 620.42]  we did a review of it.
[620.42 --> 622.26]  So my problem with that was it didn't lock?
[622.78 --> 623.74]  The new one locks.
[624.30 --> 624.56]  Oh,
[624.64 --> 625.32]  I might try that.
[625.42 --> 626.48]  I can return my chair.
[626.60 --> 626.76]  Uh,
[626.76 --> 627.22]  you know what?
[627.26 --> 627.98]  You should come over.
[628.64 --> 630.12]  Maybe come over in,
[630.20 --> 630.48]  uh,
[630.52 --> 630.96]  oh,
[631.44 --> 631.94]  holy crap,
[632.02 --> 633.52]  they have me quoted on their website.
[633.52 --> 635.54]  I should make sure what they're saying isn't like.
[635.64 --> 639.74]  Linus of Linus Tech Tips says the OM5 is the most comfortable chair.
[639.78 --> 641.86]  They probably could have put some context around that.
[641.90 --> 642.70]  I'm sure I did.
[642.86 --> 643.56]  Let's have a look.
[644.22 --> 645.50]  Do they link right to the timestamp?
[645.86 --> 646.70]  Don't think so.
[648.10 --> 649.00]  I bet they do.
[649.08 --> 649.54]  I bet they do.
[649.62 --> 649.72]  No.
[649.72 --> 651.08]  Oh,
[651.08 --> 651.20]  no.
[652.46 --> 652.92]  All right.
[653.00 --> 653.18]  Well,
[653.28 --> 654.22]  thanks for that guys.
[654.74 --> 654.90]  Yeah.
[654.98 --> 657.10]  I'm sure I probably said that I've tried so far.
[657.10 --> 658.24]  Return it in what box?
[658.30 --> 658.88]  Someone said in the chat,
[659.12 --> 660.02]  sorry to cut you off.
[660.08 --> 661.34]  I actually thought about this.
[661.48 --> 662.66]  If I return the chair,
[662.76 --> 663.64]  I'm wondering like,
[664.08 --> 665.18]  like if it shows up damaged,
[665.24 --> 666.12]  is it my fault?
[666.56 --> 669.92]  I have all of the original packaging because it's a box.
[670.20 --> 670.84]  So like,
[670.86 --> 672.80]  there's really not a lot going on there.
[673.18 --> 673.70]  Like I,
[673.84 --> 674.38]  but like who,
[674.42 --> 674.64]  who,
[674.68 --> 676.50]  who gets in trouble if the chair's damaged when it,
[676.62 --> 677.34]  when it shows up?
[677.34 --> 678.02]  Anyway,
[678.20 --> 678.54]  you should,
[678.64 --> 679.40]  you should try.
[680.02 --> 680.38]  Wait.
[680.50 --> 680.64]  Oh,
[680.66 --> 680.92]  actually,
[681.00 --> 681.14]  no,
[681.16 --> 682.46]  I don't know if the whole thing locks,
[682.54 --> 683.06]  but the arm,
[683.16 --> 684.10]  the armrests lock.
[684.18 --> 684.68]  Like there's stuff.
[684.84 --> 684.88]  They,
[685.02 --> 685.12]  they,
[685.12 --> 687.46]  my problem was if I sat back at all,
[687.66 --> 689.52]  I would just fall backwards.
[689.68 --> 693.30]  So Yvonne has new ones or has one of the new ones.
[693.50 --> 693.76]  Okay.
[693.88 --> 694.32]  So you,
[694.44 --> 694.70]  I mean,
[694.72 --> 697.28]  give it a shot just to make sure because I'll try it.
[697.34 --> 701.56]  One of my biggest problems with buying these ludicrously expensive chairs as well.
[701.68 --> 702.44]  This one's not that bad.
[702.50 --> 703.48]  It's 450 bucks.
[703.58 --> 704.70]  That's way freaking better.
[705.34 --> 706.12]  Is like,
[706.12 --> 707.82]  you can't generally try them anywhere.
[708.34 --> 708.58]  Yeah.
[708.98 --> 709.88]  Not in Canada.
[710.14 --> 711.36]  If you're in like LA,
[711.66 --> 714.58]  you can often go to a studio area and try them out.
[714.88 --> 715.18]  But like,
[715.24 --> 715.56]  I can't,
[715.62 --> 717.44]  so I had to go off of like a whole bunch of,
[717.44 --> 717.86]  just like,
[718.00 --> 719.84]  and buying anything like clothing,
[720.24 --> 723.04]  clothing or ergonomic based food or chairs,
[723.04 --> 724.84]  like stuff that has a personal taste,
[725.00 --> 727.88]  like a personalization element to it online is really tough stuff.
[727.88 --> 728.14]  It is.
[728.36 --> 728.50]  Yeah.
[728.50 --> 728.98]  Um,
[729.26 --> 729.58]  like,
[729.62 --> 729.96]  uh,
[730.00 --> 733.46]  Yvonne ordered some flip flops off Amazon and she just like,
[733.50 --> 734.92]  they were cheaper than buying in store.
[735.04 --> 735.86]  So that's cool.
[735.96 --> 737.00]  So she ordered two of them.
[737.12 --> 737.34]  Yeah.
[737.50 --> 739.96]  Just assuming that one of them would be a horrible fit because,
[740.12 --> 741.62]  because that's just the way it works.
[741.62 --> 742.94]  And until we can,
[743.32 --> 749.00]  until we can 3d scan our foot and submit that model off to something to,
[749.08 --> 750.50]  to make sure something's going to fit for us,
[750.54 --> 751.70]  there's nothing we can really do.
[752.04 --> 752.92]  But I mean,
[752.92 --> 755.42]  I'm actually perfectly fine with them having that quote on there.
[755.42 --> 758.06]  Cause it's still the most comfortable chair that I have and that I've
[758.06 --> 758.34]  tried.
[758.50 --> 758.90]  Um,
[758.90 --> 759.72]  I really like it.
[759.90 --> 761.42]  So I don't know.
[761.68 --> 761.86]  Yeah.
[761.94 --> 762.12]  I,
[762.24 --> 762.80]  and like,
[763.04 --> 763.88]  see people are,
[764.18 --> 765.76]  people are recommending stuff in here.
[765.84 --> 767.06]  The problem is that it doesn't,
[767.18 --> 769.36]  it doesn't mean anything to me because I can't try it.
[769.46 --> 769.60]  Yeah.
[769.60 --> 772.92]  The only reason that I'm even bringing it up is because I have the newest
[772.92 --> 776.00]  one at my house and you can come try it.
[776.00 --> 780.48]  And like the only reason why I got the chair that I have now is because
[780.48 --> 782.22]  Marquez has it.
[782.90 --> 783.00]  Yeah.
[783.22 --> 784.10]  Frank has it.
[784.10 --> 789.84]  And I tried it at Sevedis is streaming area because it's his chair.
[789.94 --> 791.66]  So I don't want this to come across wrong,
[791.78 --> 794.90]  but I wouldn't necessarily buy something because,
[794.90 --> 795.72]  um,
[795.92 --> 796.22]  like,
[796.42 --> 796.60]  you know,
[796.60 --> 797.96]  let's just pick one of them.
[798.00 --> 798.12]  Like,
[798.16 --> 799.24]  let's say because Marquez,
[799.36 --> 801.46]  he bought a Tesla surfboard.
[801.74 --> 802.80]  That's a good point.
[802.92 --> 805.74]  Not because it's a good surfboard because he's like,
[805.80 --> 806.56]  he's a very,
[806.80 --> 808.36]  like he's,
[808.40 --> 810.42]  he's very on point with like,
[810.46 --> 811.96]  whatever's the coolest thing.
[811.96 --> 814.04]  So the last point was the important one was seven.
[814.10 --> 817.24]  And I sat in it for a while and was like,
[817.30 --> 817.48]  okay,
[817.48 --> 818.98]  this is holding me in the right spot.
[819.20 --> 821.20]  And it's the same reason why he has it.
[821.44 --> 822.58]  He's a tall dude.
[822.62 --> 823.88]  I believe he's slightly taller than I am.
[824.06 --> 826.40]  And it can hold his spine in place.
[830.28 --> 830.94]  All right.
[831.34 --> 832.94]  So sorry to hear that.
[833.76 --> 834.14]  Anyway,
[834.26 --> 834.80]  that was just,
[834.88 --> 835.02]  yeah,
[835.08 --> 835.72]  it was just horrible.
[835.90 --> 837.34]  It was weird because I opened,
[837.50 --> 840.64]  opened a Logitech mouse and a Herman Miller chair.
[840.64 --> 840.92]  Right.
[840.92 --> 841.84]  And I expected like,
[841.94 --> 845.56]  I expected the Logitech mouse unboxing experience to be quite good.
[845.82 --> 847.24]  It exceeded expectations.
[847.58 --> 851.04]  I expected the Herman Miller chair unboxing to be way too much.
[851.04 --> 851.92]  And for me to be like,
[851.98 --> 852.60]  this is dumb.
[852.70 --> 855.82]  I wish they didn't do so much packaging because I could have saved some money.
[856.08 --> 856.88]  And then it was like,
[857.10 --> 857.76]  wow,
[857.76 --> 862.84]  I literally don't think they could have gotten it to me if I saved any amount of money on the packaging.
[862.98 --> 864.12]  Because it wouldn't have made it.
[864.22 --> 867.04]  Or it would have been like some dude just like handing me the chair.
[867.30 --> 869.14]  Because he had to like walk it from the truck.
[869.36 --> 869.94]  Rolling it.
[870.10 --> 870.36]  Yeah.
[870.42 --> 870.60]  Yeah.
[870.72 --> 870.82]  Like,
[870.82 --> 871.66]  here you go,
[871.72 --> 871.92]  bud.
[872.34 --> 873.32]  I've got it for you.
[873.36 --> 874.48]  We're backing it up.
[874.62 --> 875.44]  We're backing it up.
[875.68 --> 875.96]  Beep,
[875.96 --> 876.18]  beep.
[878.86 --> 879.26]  So,
[879.40 --> 879.70]  so,
[879.70 --> 880.60]  so annoyed.
[880.60 --> 884.76]  Give it some time and maybe Logitech will just acquire Herman Miller and then you won't have to worry about it.
[884.86 --> 886.92]  Just like they acquired our first topic,
[886.92 --> 887.54]  like blue.
[888.26 --> 888.66]  Yeah.
[889.36 --> 892.52]  Logitech has acquired microphone brand blue.
[893.54 --> 895.02]  But don't be blue.
[897.20 --> 898.40]  I don't know.
[898.46 --> 899.84]  You might want to be blue about it.
[900.64 --> 901.08]  Honestly,
[901.20 --> 905.56]  there's not going to be much in terms of changes as far as we can tell from Logitech's blog post anyway.
[905.56 --> 905.96]  So,
[906.10 --> 906.62]  well,
[906.72 --> 906.86]  okay.
[906.94 --> 913.10]  I will also give them the benefit of the doubt in the way that they have not made very noticeable,
[913.28 --> 915.60]  very large alterations to any other companies that they bought.
[915.78 --> 916.62]  Like ultimate ears.
[916.62 --> 917.18]  Oh,
[917.54 --> 918.40]  hold on a second.
[919.02 --> 920.08]  There have been,
[920.14 --> 922.10]  there's been some frustration with Harmony.
[922.88 --> 923.28]  Harmony?
[923.36 --> 924.14]  Harmony remotes.
[924.26 --> 924.44]  Yeah.
[925.10 --> 925.46]  Oh,
[925.52 --> 926.54]  that's old though,
[926.56 --> 926.92]  isn't it?
[927.38 --> 927.74]  Yeah,
[927.74 --> 931.06]  but that doesn't mean that people didn't get kind of boned.
[931.10 --> 931.20]  No,
[931.24 --> 931.60]  I hear you,
[931.66 --> 934.98]  but they might've learned from that.
[935.62 --> 936.32]  We can hope.
[936.40 --> 937.04]  They haven't made it.
[937.12 --> 937.94]  As far as we can tell,
[938.00 --> 939.86]  they haven't made a lot of changes to ultimate ears.
[939.86 --> 942.54]  It seems like this is kind of the thing right now though,
[943.06 --> 944.26]  is your,
[944.26 --> 945.18]  your Corsairs,
[945.42 --> 946.04]  your Razors,
[946.20 --> 952.62]  and your Logitechs of the world are just scooping up any brand that kind of matters in the peripheral space.
[952.62 --> 953.54]  Like I think we are,
[954.04 --> 954.20]  we're,
[954.40 --> 955.00]  so we're,
[955.06 --> 958.88]  we're on this weird trajectory right now where over the last,
[959.60 --> 960.96]  I'd say five.
[961.34 --> 961.58]  So,
[961.62 --> 964.28]  so going back maybe a year or two years ago,
[964.28 --> 966.26]  and then five years before that,
[966.44 --> 971.80]  we saw this incredible burst in diversification in the peripheral space.
[972.44 --> 973.40]  So we went from,
[973.68 --> 973.86]  you know,
[973.88 --> 976.40]  like every single person was making some form of keyboard.
[976.60 --> 978.30]  Like mechanical keyboards are a great example.
[978.48 --> 978.92]  You had what?
[979.02 --> 979.84]  Like Philco,
[980.62 --> 981.20]  Ducky.
[981.92 --> 982.22]  I mean,
[982.22 --> 984.32]  do you remember when Das keyboard mattered?
[984.68 --> 985.08]  Leopold.
[985.26 --> 985.46]  Yeah.
[985.84 --> 992.98]  So you had a handful of guys making mechanical keyboards and then you had some more traditional brands that dabbled.
[992.98 --> 994.70]  Like SteelSeries had one mechanical,
[994.84 --> 995.18]  or two,
[995.32 --> 995.44]  okay,
[995.52 --> 996.50]  the 6G and the 7G.
[997.38 --> 1008.58]  And then all of a sudden you walked around a show like CES or Computex and you could find literally 50 brands that made keyboards.
[1008.70 --> 1009.90]  Das is still relevant.
[1011.00 --> 1011.84]  To you.
[1012.26 --> 1012.70]  Oh.
[1013.34 --> 1013.58]  Ooh.
[1014.12 --> 1015.22]  I like Das keyboard.
[1015.28 --> 1015.64]  Remember,
[1015.78 --> 1016.74]  relevant is a,
[1016.98 --> 1017.58]  is a,
[1017.58 --> 1018.18]  is a,
[1018.18 --> 1019.66]  so they're still relevant,
[1019.80 --> 1020.72]  but they're not mainstream.
[1021.52 --> 1022.00]  Yeah.
[1022.00 --> 1027.12]  They can be as relevant as they want to a very small number of people.
[1027.12 --> 1027.60]  Yeah.
[1027.68 --> 1031.10]  But when you look at the definition of the word relevant,
[1031.78 --> 1032.44]  it's,
[1032.56 --> 1033.38]  it's relative.
[1033.90 --> 1034.10]  Ooh.
[1034.34 --> 1034.82]  So.
[1035.26 --> 1037.42]  So they were more relevant before.
[1037.52 --> 1037.64]  Yeah.
[1037.68 --> 1039.28]  They were in relative terms,
[1039.28 --> 1041.84]  much more relevant than they are now.
[1041.84 --> 1044.84]  When you've got brands like Corsair who,
[1045.68 --> 1046.28]  you know,
[1046.34 --> 1047.00]  for whom the,
[1047.00 --> 1047.28]  the,
[1047.28 --> 1047.52]  the,
[1047.52 --> 1051.18]  the monthly sales of someone like Das keyboard would be a rounding error.
[1051.18 --> 1052.56]  Like that would be the,
[1052.76 --> 1055.18]  that would be the samples they send out to,
[1055.18 --> 1061.80]  to media when they launch a new keyboard to make sure that everyone and their dog has tried the latest and greatest Corsair keyboard.
[1061.80 --> 1062.72]  And hopefully it's,
[1062.78 --> 1064.14]  it's sitting in,
[1064.22 --> 1064.86]  in places.
[1065.28 --> 1065.56]  Yeah,
[1066.04 --> 1066.62]  exactly.
[1066.62 --> 1067.58]  Um,
[1067.58 --> 1067.86]  so,
[1067.86 --> 1068.52]  so there's just,
[1068.62 --> 1070.66]  there's this sort of relativity to,
[1070.72 --> 1072.04]  to relevantness,
[1072.12 --> 1072.88]  relevantness,
[1073.62 --> 1074.26]  relevantity.
[1074.52 --> 1074.88]  I don't know.
[1075.34 --> 1076.12]  I'm trying,
[1076.40 --> 1078.82]  which brings us to our first sponsor for the show today.
[1078.82 --> 1079.04]  I mean,
[1079.04 --> 1080.28]  it was just such a perfect segue.
[1080.40 --> 1081.44]  I kind of had to do it.
[1082.00 --> 1082.40]  Hey,
[1082.90 --> 1086.46]  Corsair's Strafe Mark two keyboard,
[1086.46 --> 1090.50]  which you can learn more about at the link right there.
[1090.50 --> 1095.98]  It's a mechanical RGB keyboard and is an update from the previous fan favorite Strafe.
[1096.06 --> 1098.12]  Now with all the features you've been asking for,
[1098.72 --> 1098.90]  well,
[1098.96 --> 1101.32]  not all the features you've been asking for if you as me,
[1101.40 --> 1103.56]  because I'm a big fan of Cherry MX Browns,
[1103.56 --> 1109.46]  but it comes in either Cherry MX Red or Cherry MX Silent switches with the Reds offerings linear,
[1109.72 --> 1110.44]  smooth actuation,
[1110.56 --> 1112.96]  while the silence dampened sound by 30%,
[1112.96 --> 1115.18]  which is great for users who stream.
[1115.64 --> 1116.70]  That's actually a big deal,
[1116.80 --> 1117.38]  keyboard noise.
[1117.54 --> 1118.44]  So Cherry MX Silent,
[1118.54 --> 1119.68]  definitely recommended for that.
[1119.98 --> 1122.72]  It's got a hundred percent anti-ghosting with 104 key rollover,
[1122.82 --> 1124.20]  meaning even if you type with your face,
[1124.58 --> 1126.34]  all of your keystrokes will be registered.
[1126.48 --> 1126.78]  Thank you,
[1126.82 --> 1126.92]  Luke,
[1126.96 --> 1127.62]  for that demonstration.
[1128.00 --> 1133.54]  It's got eight mags of built-in storage to allow you to take all your RGB configurations and macro customization with you anywhere you go.
[1134.20 --> 1137.62]  And the top of the keyboard has a built-in USB pass-through,
[1137.76 --> 1138.88]  which I actually love.
[1138.96 --> 1143.56]  That's a great feature that kind of disappeared for a bit in the keyboard world and then is back now, apparently,
[1144.08 --> 1145.18]  which is terrific.
[1145.56 --> 1148.70]  So check it out at Corsair.com or the link in the video description.
[1149.36 --> 1149.54]  Oh,
[1149.64 --> 1150.92]  I said the link was there,
[1150.98 --> 1151.48]  but it's not.
[1151.56 --> 1151.90]  It will be,
[1151.94 --> 1152.92]  it will be below the video.
[1153.02 --> 1153.66]  Corsair.com.
[1154.06 --> 1154.42]  That's okay.
[1154.50 --> 1155.10]  Simple solution.
[1155.54 --> 1156.94]  Speaking of a simple solution,
[1157.20 --> 1157.68]  Squarespace.
[1158.48 --> 1163.10]  Squarespace lets you build your own beautiful website quickly and simply.
[1163.58 --> 1167.16]  Squarespace offers 24-7 support via live chat and email.
[1167.16 --> 1172.02]  It starts at just $12 a month and you get a free domain if you buy Squarespace for the year.
[1172.48 --> 1177.98]  Every Squarespace template features responsive design so your website scales to look great on any device.
[1178.50 --> 1179.66]  Their commerce module,
[1179.84 --> 1182.14]  which lets you set up a free online store.
[1182.14 --> 1187.86]  And the ability to publish content in Apple News format directly from the Squarespace blog module.
[1188.18 --> 1189.04]  What's really cool,
[1189.24 --> 1189.52]  actually,
[1189.62 --> 1190.94]  they added this functionality recently,
[1191.06 --> 1194.56]  is you can now use Squarespace to manage all of your domains.
[1194.72 --> 1195.22]  So you can,
[1195.46 --> 1198.00]  instead of having a bunch of different registrars and whatnot,
[1198.70 --> 1199.38]  you can,
[1199.56 --> 1201.86]  I don't know what he's doing right now,
[1201.92 --> 1204.92]  but he seems to be doing a thing.
[1205.06 --> 1205.84]  This is that.
[1205.84 --> 1206.60]  Uh,
[1206.60 --> 1208.22]  just making sure that you know,
[1208.32 --> 1209.78]  so that you don't type a thing.
[1209.86 --> 1211.06]  That does not matter.
[1211.98 --> 1212.54]  Uh,
[1212.72 --> 1214.38]  I'm going to go ahead and,
[1214.60 --> 1214.72]  yeah,
[1214.80 --> 1214.96]  no,
[1215.00 --> 1217.02]  I'm pretty sure it's fine.
[1217.38 --> 1217.58]  Nope.
[1217.72 --> 1218.04]  That's,
[1218.20 --> 1218.82]  don't worry about it.
[1218.86 --> 1219.12]  Don't worry about it.
[1219.12 --> 1219.42]  Okay.
[1219.42 --> 1223.46]  I will not worry about whatever it is that you are doing right now.
[1223.66 --> 1231.94]  Go sign up for Squarespace and make sure you use offer code when to get 10% off your first purchase.
[1232.86 --> 1233.68]  Last monster,
[1233.80 --> 1234.24]  FreshBooks.
[1235.06 --> 1237.26]  If you're a small business owner or a freelancer,
[1237.26 --> 1242.46]  and you want a simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than just send invoices,
[1242.74 --> 1243.56]  check out FreshBooks.
[1243.74 --> 1245.96]  It helps you track your time with their timesheet function,
[1246.12 --> 1248.06]  manage your expenses with their expense function,
[1248.06 --> 1251.58]  and keep track of who owes you what with their keeping track of who owes you what function
[1251.58 --> 1252.92]  that actually tells you,
[1253.00 --> 1253.80]  it's not called that,
[1254.14 --> 1257.92]  but it actually tells you when your clients have looked at an invoice for the first time
[1257.92 --> 1259.26]  to put an end to the guessing games.
[1259.58 --> 1260.30]  Their mobile app,
[1260.38 --> 1262.98]  which is available for iOS and Android,
[1263.60 --> 1264.54]  where's my Android?
[1264.96 --> 1267.38]  Android has all the functionality of the desktop version,
[1267.48 --> 1269.28]  so you can take FreshBooks with you wherever you go,
[1269.40 --> 1270.96]  and they have amazing support.
[1271.06 --> 1271.46]  You call them,
[1271.50 --> 1272.48]  you talk to a real person,
[1272.58 --> 1273.54]  no home phone tree,
[1273.82 --> 1274.48]  no escalations,
[1274.56 --> 1275.18]  no return calls,
[1275.28 --> 1275.88]  just answers.
[1276.16 --> 1277.86]  Go to freshbooks.com slash when,
[1277.86 --> 1279.36]  and get a free trial today.
[1280.48 --> 1281.16]  All right,
[1281.26 --> 1282.36]  shall we do some tech news?
[1283.04 --> 1283.84]  News about tech?
[1284.88 --> 1285.32]  Sure.
[1285.72 --> 1288.26]  Next gen NVIDIA GTX.
[1288.34 --> 1291.32]  The name has apparently been settled.
[1292.54 --> 1292.78]  Dun,
[1292.96 --> 1293.32]  dun,
[1293.48 --> 1293.86]  dun.
[1294.60 --> 1296.26]  Let's go ahead and share my screen.
[1296.32 --> 1296.52]  Wow,
[1296.58 --> 1297.34]  I'm so surprised.
[1297.82 --> 1300.14]  It'll be 2080 and 2070.
[1300.24 --> 1301.20]  That's kind of stupid.
[1302.20 --> 1305.34]  I was expecting 1180 and 1170 were going to win the day,
[1305.48 --> 1307.06]  but I guess NVIDIA is kind of going,
[1307.18 --> 1307.42]  well,
[1307.58 --> 1310.94]  the rate at which we release new generations of graphics cards
[1310.94 --> 1313.94]  has significantly slowed down,
[1313.94 --> 1317.32]  so in order for us to keep having numbers go up at a nice,
[1317.58 --> 1318.20]  you know,
[1318.30 --> 1318.72]  nice,
[1318.88 --> 1319.80]  good tick here,
[1319.96 --> 1322.18]  we're going to have to chill out on the,
[1322.46 --> 1324.82]  just increasing the second digit kind of thing.
[1324.98 --> 1325.20]  Yeah.
[1325.94 --> 1328.30]  I think they're also probably going with,
[1328.40 --> 1328.76]  like,
[1328.88 --> 1329.30]  if you,
[1329.36 --> 1332.26]  if you increase the first digit instead of the,
[1333.50 --> 1334.80]  what way are we reading from?
[1334.80 --> 1335.70]  The fourth digit?
[1335.92 --> 1336.94]  So we had the 780,
[1337.10 --> 1337.62]  and then the,
[1337.68 --> 1339.46]  we skipped 800 series because,
[1339.70 --> 1340.02]  I don't know,
[1340.06 --> 1340.96]  it's unlucky or something,
[1341.02 --> 1341.32]  who knows?
[1341.58 --> 1343.00]  And then we had the nine series,
[1343.18 --> 1344.54]  and then we had the 10 series,
[1344.94 --> 1346.04]  and now we get the 20.
[1346.54 --> 1347.06]  So when we,
[1347.12 --> 1347.36]  so we,
[1347.42 --> 1348.16]  when we go 30,
[1348.24 --> 1348.56]  40,
[1348.90 --> 1349.14]  50,
[1349.26 --> 1349.50]  60,
[1349.62 --> 1349.86]  70,
[1349.94 --> 1350.10]  80,
[1350.18 --> 1350.44]  90,
[1350.50 --> 1352.04]  do we get the 100 series?
[1352.62 --> 1352.82]  Yes,
[1352.84 --> 1354.30]  but then do we get the 200 series?
[1354.30 --> 1356.42]  And then are we back to the 200 series?
[1357.16 --> 1358.38]  That's going to be confusing.
[1358.56 --> 1359.04]  So in another,
[1359.12 --> 1359.40]  like,
[1359.48 --> 1360.34]  20 years or so,
[1360.40 --> 1366.20]  NVIDIA is going to have to watch out for that train coming down the tracks pretty slowly,
[1366.46 --> 1368.46]  and won't happen for a while,
[1368.56 --> 1371.10]  but that could happen eventually.
[1372.06 --> 1372.50]  Well,
[1372.52 --> 1374.04]  because we had a 200 series already,
[1374.42 --> 1376.10]  but that was a three digit 200 series.
[1376.22 --> 1377.90]  This would be the 200 and,
[1378.40 --> 1379.76]  280 series?
[1379.76 --> 1384.42]  The 2000,
[1384.66 --> 1386.28]  GTX 2080.
[1386.62 --> 1389.98]  You think they might just end up almost dumping that version?
[1390.64 --> 1391.32]  And go like,
[1391.42 --> 1392.02]  GTX,
[1392.10 --> 1392.40]  like,
[1393.40 --> 1394.20]  Alpha 1.
[1394.30 --> 1394.48]  Oh.
[1394.58 --> 1394.88]  And like,
[1394.96 --> 1395.60]  Alpha 2.
[1395.68 --> 1397.78]  Or they could go straight to 300,
[1398.04 --> 1399.80]  because we never had a 300 series.
[1400.92 --> 1401.12]  Oh.
[1402.68 --> 1403.10]  Yeah,
[1403.12 --> 1403.42]  we're not.
[1403.58 --> 1403.94]  I don't know.
[1404.70 --> 1405.10]  Anyway,
[1405.48 --> 1406.90]  Manly Technologies,
[1406.90 --> 1408.04]  an NVIDIA partner.
[1408.04 --> 1410.20]  800 series was used in like mobile and stuff.
[1410.40 --> 1410.72]  Yes,
[1410.84 --> 1412.90]  like OEM only or some stupid thing.
[1413.08 --> 1413.14]  Yeah.
[1413.68 --> 1414.76]  Manly Technologies,
[1415.00 --> 1417.54]  a vendor for NVIDIA GeForce GPUs,
[1417.58 --> 1423.44]  just registered an ECC certificate with the name GTX 2070 and 2080 included in the mix.
[1424.14 --> 1430.24]  The GPU chips also contain GA104 and GA104 400,
[1430.92 --> 1434.58]  both of which should be Ampere based going by the code name.
[1434.70 --> 1435.20]  So if you guys,
[1435.26 --> 1436.44]  I don't know if you guys ever noticed this,
[1436.44 --> 1439.88]  but the second letter of an NVIDIA code name is the architecture.
[1440.06 --> 1442.14]  So GP would be GeForce Pascal,
[1442.54 --> 1445.22]  and then GF would be GeForce Fermi.
[1445.32 --> 1447.36]  So GA should be GeForce Ampere.
[1448.02 --> 1450.14]  104 means that once again,
[1450.20 --> 1451.72]  we are getting not a big chip.
[1451.96 --> 1452.06]  Yeah.
[1452.18 --> 1455.88]  So 102 or 100 would be big chips.
[1456.90 --> 1458.50]  I forget how it works.
[1459.88 --> 1462.42]  What's the thing when they had to spin it twice?
[1462.72 --> 1463.42]  I can't remember.
[1463.42 --> 1465.68]  What was 580?
[1466.46 --> 1466.86]  GTX 580.
[1466.98 --> 1467.96]  They had to spin it twice?
[1468.24 --> 1468.46]  Yeah.
[1469.72 --> 1471.40]  So GF 110.
[1472.70 --> 1472.98]  Nah.
[1473.34 --> 1473.74]  Crap.
[1473.88 --> 1474.20]  I can't remember.
[1474.26 --> 1474.86]  I can't remember.
[1475.20 --> 1475.78]  I can't remember.
[1475.92 --> 1479.20]  But there's one aspect of the code name that tells you if they had to,
[1479.20 --> 1483.68]  if the first run was good enough or if they had to spin again.
[1483.92 --> 1484.32]  Oh.
[1484.78 --> 1485.20]  Okay.
[1486.04 --> 1486.38]  Weird.
[1486.62 --> 1488.06]  It's not terribly important.
[1489.14 --> 1491.90]  So it's a real certification,
[1492.46 --> 1495.78]  but it is also still possible that the company is using placeholder names
[1495.78 --> 1497.40]  and the actual nomenclature is something else.
[1497.40 --> 1502.18]  Although we are so close to when it is rumored to be announced at Gamescom,
[1502.58 --> 1504.34]  which starts on August 21st,
[1504.34 --> 1510.64]  that it is hard to imagine that they're planning to do a switcheroo at the last minute.
[1510.76 --> 1511.38]  With that said,
[1511.76 --> 1518.46]  I have seen packaging on NVIDIA cards come in with like stickers over top of old names.
[1518.46 --> 1523.46]  And sometimes NVIDIA will go so far to throw the industry for a loop
[1523.46 --> 1527.02]  that they will legitimately charge their customers.
[1527.46 --> 1530.74]  So not like you, the end user, but customers like EBGA.
[1531.00 --> 1533.86]  They will literally charge their customers one price
[1533.86 --> 1538.44]  and then the day of the launch announce that it's a completely different price
[1538.44 --> 1540.94]  and just issue a rebate after the fact.
[1541.14 --> 1542.74]  They have actually done that.
[1543.04 --> 1543.12]  Yeah.
[1543.44 --> 1545.76]  So those guys are like,
[1545.76 --> 1549.96]  I mean, I've said this to enough people at NVIDIA's faces
[1549.96 --> 1552.08]  that I don't feel like I'm talking behind their back,
[1552.24 --> 1555.78]  but enough with the cloak and dagger bull crap, you guys.
[1556.02 --> 1559.60]  Just release the product.
[1560.70 --> 1561.04]  Okay?
[1561.78 --> 1562.80]  Just chill.
[1562.88 --> 1564.10]  It's just a graphics card.
[1564.30 --> 1564.88]  Come on, boys.
[1565.12 --> 1565.76]  Like this is not...
[1567.12 --> 1568.10]  No, Linus.
[1568.28 --> 1569.84]  We're sending people to the moon.
[1570.86 --> 1571.34]  No.
[1571.58 --> 1572.02]  Mars.
[1572.54 --> 1572.94]  Titan.
[1573.94 --> 1574.82]  Shut up.
[1575.76 --> 1578.50]  Can you do the next topic?
[1578.60 --> 1579.10]  I can't.
[1579.50 --> 1580.96]  I'm not even...
[1580.96 --> 1582.54]  I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
[1582.98 --> 1583.44]  Gosh.
[1583.52 --> 1588.22]  There's a super long topic about a UK committee trying to battle fake news
[1588.22 --> 1590.86]  that I don't even want to talk about at all.
[1590.86 --> 1591.10]  Oh boy.
[1591.18 --> 1592.32]  Battling fake news.
[1593.34 --> 1595.06]  A levy on social media.
[1595.82 --> 1596.26]  Wow.
[1596.86 --> 1597.96]  So this is kind of like the...
[1597.96 --> 1598.52]  Oh boy.
[1598.60 --> 1599.48]  Do you remember that levy...
[1599.48 --> 1600.10]  Oh, we are going to talk.
[1600.16 --> 1600.38]  Okay.
[1600.70 --> 1601.30]  Let's do it.
[1601.30 --> 1603.84]  Well, I was going to talk about the levy on blank CDs
[1603.84 --> 1605.16]  that we have here in Canada.
[1605.16 --> 1605.84]  What?
[1606.22 --> 1607.06]  You don't know about this?
[1607.16 --> 1607.40]  No?
[1607.58 --> 1607.80]  Yeah.
[1607.84 --> 1610.38]  When you buy a blank CD, it comes with like a...
[1610.38 --> 1610.66]  I don't know.
[1610.68 --> 1612.22]  It's like a couple cents or something like that.
[1612.28 --> 1613.94]  But basically, it's...
[1613.94 --> 1615.64]  Is it to like fund piracy?
[1615.88 --> 1616.32]  Anti-piracy?
[1616.32 --> 1616.48]  No.
[1616.64 --> 1616.84]  Yeah.
[1616.98 --> 1618.02]  It's to fund piracy.
[1618.04 --> 1618.94]  Funding piracy.
[1618.96 --> 1619.94]  Canadian government.
[1620.10 --> 1620.98]  Yarrr!
[1623.78 --> 1624.56]  Oh my goodness.
[1624.56 --> 1624.70]  Yeah.
[1624.78 --> 1629.46]  No, it's to theoretically to fund anti-piracy measures
[1629.46 --> 1633.42]  or reimburse organizations that lost money due to piracy or whatever.
[1633.56 --> 1633.90]  Interesting.
[1634.02 --> 1636.90]  Because obviously, you know, iTunes and Spotify
[1636.90 --> 1641.58]  weren't a better long-term solution than charging a levy on blank CDs.
[1641.58 --> 1646.80]  So, what they're proposing is a principle-based...
[1646.80 --> 1647.54]  Sorry.
[1647.76 --> 1651.54]  Principle-based recommendations designed to be sufficiently adaptive
[1651.54 --> 1654.06]  to deal with fast-moving technological developments.
[1654.34 --> 1655.66]  Principle-based recommendations.
[1655.90 --> 1656.14]  Whatever.
[1656.14 --> 1657.06]  From the government.
[1657.64 --> 1658.24]  Literally.
[1659.20 --> 1660.06]  Buzzword suit.
[1660.28 --> 1660.34]  What?
[1660.34 --> 1663.78]  So, it's a levy on social media and tech giants
[1663.78 --> 1667.42]  to fund expanding a major investment in the UK's data watchdog
[1667.42 --> 1670.60]  so the body is able to attract and employ more technically skilled engineers
[1670.60 --> 1672.42]  who can analyze current technologies
[1672.42 --> 1674.76]  and have the capacity to predict future technologies.
[1677.06 --> 1677.54]  Okay.
[1679.26 --> 1681.82]  I mean, so it's not like there aren't precedents for this.
[1681.90 --> 1684.06]  This is similar to the way in which the banking sector
[1684.06 --> 1686.48]  pays for the upkeep of the Financial Conduct Authority.
[1686.48 --> 1693.20]  There's a code for advertising through social media during election periods.
[1693.76 --> 1696.40]  Limits to the most amount of money an individual can donate.
[1697.16 --> 1699.10]  And a major increase in the maximum fine.
[1699.22 --> 1703.08]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1703.08 --> 1703.40]  Okay.
[1703.76 --> 1704.30]  So, yeah.
[1704.92 --> 1708.36]  There's going to be some interesting laws over the next little bit.
[1708.44 --> 1708.60]  Sorry.
[1708.74 --> 1709.74]  I threw up a little in my mouth there.
[1711.98 --> 1712.80]  I didn't actually.
[1712.92 --> 1713.42]  It was just a burp.
[1713.56 --> 1713.82]  Yeah.
[1714.10 --> 1714.32]  Yeah.
[1714.32 --> 1717.76]  And I was trying to hold it in so that the poor headphone users at home
[1717.76 --> 1719.04]  didn't have to have burp sound.
[1719.34 --> 1720.50]  I mean, they ended up with it.
[1720.54 --> 1721.06]  It was like really.
[1721.18 --> 1722.46]  I didn't expect it to be so loud.
[1722.56 --> 1722.68]  Yeah.
[1722.80 --> 1723.28]  It was very.
[1723.60 --> 1726.18]  It was as unpleasant to feel as it was for you to hear.
[1726.20 --> 1726.96]  I can't reproduce it.
[1727.08 --> 1727.24]  Yeah.
[1727.36 --> 1727.50]  No.
[1727.64 --> 1728.72]  You can't really do that.
[1729.68 --> 1731.36]  Intel had some roadmap leaps,
[1731.44 --> 1734.32]  which ironically are over on videocards.com.
[1734.42 --> 1735.54]  Intel doesn't make video cards.
[1735.58 --> 1736.82]  At least not yet.
[1737.64 --> 1738.86]  Maybe that'll be their new foray.
[1739.40 --> 1739.86]  It is.
[1740.46 --> 1741.34]  They hired Roger Kaduri.
[1741.62 --> 1742.32]  Well, okay.
[1742.92 --> 1743.68]  You just got wrecked.
[1743.68 --> 1743.96]  Nope.
[1744.04 --> 1744.26]  Nope.
[1744.38 --> 1744.54]  Yeah.
[1744.64 --> 1744.86]  Okay.
[1744.88 --> 1745.18]  Hold on.
[1745.26 --> 1745.80]  Let's watch him back.
[1745.80 --> 1747.06]  They're not making dedicated cards though, right?
[1747.06 --> 1747.26]  Go ahead.
[1748.18 --> 1749.26]  It's not a card, is it?
[1749.26 --> 1749.44]  Oh, yeah.
[1749.70 --> 1750.12]  It is?
[1750.40 --> 1750.72]  Apparently.
[1751.76 --> 1752.68]  Oh, I actually didn't know that.
[1752.74 --> 1752.94]  Yeah.
[1753.04 --> 1753.18]  Okay.
[1753.28 --> 1757.26]  I was just having some fun with him.
[1757.44 --> 1761.08]  They're actually making a physical, like, PCIe card.
[1761.34 --> 1762.48]  That's the plan, apparently.
[1763.66 --> 1763.94]  Yeah.
[1764.18 --> 1765.42]  It's the word on the street.
[1765.52 --> 1765.72]  Okay.
[1765.78 --> 1767.10]  Like, it's not on a roadmap anyway.
[1767.10 --> 1771.16]  Because I knew they brought him on to help with the, like, oh, we're going to have your,
[1771.32 --> 1777.30]  the, like, AMD, or sorry, the Radeon group technology on CPU and we want, like, whatever.
[1777.30 --> 1777.44]  Oh, no.
[1777.62 --> 1777.76]  Yeah.
[1777.84 --> 1778.00]  No.
[1778.00 --> 1784.66]  I think that, I think that collaboration between Intel and Radeon technologies might, if anything,
[1784.78 --> 1787.18]  be more strained moving forward.
[1787.30 --> 1792.06]  Like, I don't think AMD was super thrilled about Raja moving on.
[1792.38 --> 1792.72]  All right.
[1792.90 --> 1793.12]  Okay.
[1793.12 --> 1795.42]  I do wonder how much a Raja Kaduri costs.
[1795.48 --> 1800.22]  Like, if I wanted to hire Raja, like, how would that even, how would that even work?
[1800.30 --> 1801.72]  Like, how do you poach a guy like that?
[1802.14 --> 1803.10]  And I wonder what.
[1803.30 --> 1804.08]  Literally industry legend.
[1804.66 --> 1804.90]  Yeah.
[1805.52 --> 1805.92]  Yeah, yeah.
[1805.92 --> 1809.90]  And I wonder what kind of, like, benefit style stuff you'd have to bundle in.
[1810.06 --> 1810.34]  Yeah.
[1811.10 --> 1815.42]  He'd probably, he'd probably have to, like, he'd probably have to have, like, you know,
[1816.40 --> 1817.94]  like, because it can't just be money.
[1817.94 --> 1820.50]  Like, it'd have to be, like, in, like, dogs, you know?
[1820.72 --> 1823.10]  Or, like, well, no, I don't know.
[1823.18 --> 1825.76]  Like, there'd have to be some kind of, like, additional benefit.
[1825.90 --> 1828.48]  Like, you'd have to have, like, a, like, a guaranteed, like, staff.
[1828.92 --> 1832.32]  Like, you're going to have two personal assistants and this and that.
[1832.38 --> 1834.70]  So, it's, like, it's more than just money.
[1834.70 --> 1840.08]  You'll have access to the executive jet from time periods X to Y.
[1840.58 --> 1845.04]  You'll have this much sabbatical every two years and, like, that kind of thing.
[1845.16 --> 1847.14]  Like, I would be really curious.
[1847.16 --> 1847.50]  It's got to be extra stuff.
[1847.68 --> 1853.30]  Because beyond a certain point, not everyone, but a lot of people will stop caring at least as much about money.
[1853.52 --> 1853.64]  Yeah.
[1853.64 --> 1857.18]  And it will take astronomically more to make it really worth their while.
[1857.18 --> 1857.34]  Yeah.
[1857.40 --> 1859.04]  So, you want to start putting in other stuff.
[1859.22 --> 1859.44]  Yeah.
[1859.44 --> 1862.44]  You have to start building, like, a benefits package.
[1862.86 --> 1868.74]  I've actually spent very little time with people who I would consider to be, like, real executives.
[1868.74 --> 1878.18]  But I did spend some time with the executive assistant of an executive at a very large tech company a little while ago.
[1878.34 --> 1879.52]  I was at a dinner.
[1880.16 --> 1885.92]  And I ended up at the table with, like, kind of the assistants and stuff.
[1886.12 --> 1886.24]  Yeah.
[1886.24 --> 1891.90]  And honestly, the conversation there was far more interesting than what I would have gotten sitting with the executives, I think.
[1891.98 --> 1894.24]  Because it's all the, like, scuttlebutts.
[1894.32 --> 1900.56]  So, they have rules, like, how often the executive assistant has to swap out.
[1900.56 --> 1911.26]  And that position is considered, like, a really tough position because you actually end up doing, like, a lot of the executives' actual work.
[1913.50 --> 1918.74]  But it's considered a stepping stone because you just have all this access to other executives.
[1919.26 --> 1919.64]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1919.64 --> 1919.76]  And, like...
[1919.76 --> 1920.88]  So, you get your name out there.
[1921.00 --> 1922.30]  You get your name out there.
[1922.52 --> 1922.86]  And you get kind of involved in everything.
[1922.86 --> 1924.42]  So, they swap, like, between each other?
[1924.42 --> 1925.76]  Or you just only...
[1925.76 --> 1928.16]  You have, like, six months to, like, make your mark.
[1928.18 --> 1928.82]  It's more than that.
[1928.82 --> 1930.74]  I think it's, like, two years or something like that.
[1930.78 --> 1933.02]  But then you have to hire a new one.
[1933.10 --> 1935.14]  And then that person goes on to a different position.
[1935.14 --> 1935.56]  Succeeds you.
[1935.58 --> 1944.28]  Because remember that a lot of large companies have policies and programs in place where people can change jobs quite frequently within the company.
[1944.40 --> 1945.50]  And it's something that's encouraged.
[1945.76 --> 1945.92]  Yeah.
[1946.04 --> 1951.06]  Just so that people won't stagnate, but so that they can retain their best talent.
[1951.18 --> 1954.94]  See, my strategy for that is to force people to work on things that they don't want to work on.
[1955.36 --> 1958.48]  So that when they're done that, they get to go back to work on something that they want to work on.
[1958.48 --> 1962.04]  And they can be excited to go to work just to go back to their regular job.
[1963.08 --> 1963.36]  Okay.
[1963.70 --> 1964.56]  Thanks, guys.
[1965.16 --> 1965.88]  Sorry, AJ.
[1967.36 --> 1968.48]  You're almost done, dude.
[1968.80 --> 1970.98]  In other news, here's that leak we were talking about.
[1970.98 --> 1974.98]  So, apparently, there's some kind of new...
[1976.44 --> 1977.74]  Is he in chat?
[1977.92 --> 1979.56]  Oh, that doesn't work, Luke.
[1979.68 --> 1980.32]  Well, didn't it?
[1980.74 --> 1981.60]  He told me it did.
[1981.74 --> 1982.70]  Is he lying to me?
[1982.70 --> 1984.42]  Because I'd love to know.
[1986.10 --> 1988.14]  I'm watching for AJ.
[1989.28 --> 1991.00]  Is he misleading me?
[1991.22 --> 1991.70]  Oh, boy.
[1991.86 --> 1993.50]  Does float plane even exist?
[1993.84 --> 1994.98]  Like, is this...
[1994.98 --> 1996.32]  Do you even work for us?
[1998.48 --> 1999.54]  Oh, boy.
[2001.42 --> 2002.30]  Dot, dot, dot.
[2002.34 --> 2002.98]  Dot, dot, dot.
[2003.42 --> 2006.54]  Meanwhile, Luke's just been siphoning all the money.
[2007.04 --> 2007.26]  Yeah.
[2007.26 --> 2010.50]  And AJ's like, what?
[2010.56 --> 2011.10]  There was money?
[2011.54 --> 2012.26]  The float plane?
[2012.34 --> 2012.78]  What's that?
[2015.02 --> 2015.70]  All right.
[2015.82 --> 2016.50]  So, okay.
[2016.58 --> 2016.90]  Okay.
[2016.90 --> 2017.80]  This roadmap.
[2018.32 --> 2024.18]  So, apparently, in 2018, we are getting a 9700K, okay?
[2024.32 --> 2026.12]  According to the roadmap leak.
[2026.12 --> 2034.94]  And then, sometime in Q3 of 2018, there's going to be something called a 9900K, which is going
[2034.94 --> 2040.08]  to be higher end than the existing Core i9s or something.
[2040.22 --> 2042.42]  Someone in chat said, siphoning money to afford your chair.
[2042.80 --> 2046.32]  Technically, I saved for four and a half years to buy that chair.
[2046.34 --> 2046.36]  Yeah.
[2046.36 --> 2047.04]  You look at it that way.
[2047.18 --> 2047.34]  Yeah.
[2047.58 --> 2050.18]  Technically, I've saved for 10 years to replace my car.
[2050.26 --> 2052.06]  So, I should just run out and buy a Model X then, right?
[2052.42 --> 2053.16]  Oh, boy.
[2054.04 --> 2054.82]  By that logic.
[2055.24 --> 2055.56]  Oh.
[2056.60 --> 2058.24]  This one was, like, highly recommended.
[2058.38 --> 2060.66]  You know what's really funny is I...
[2060.66 --> 2061.90]  I'm probably going to return it.
[2062.58 --> 2065.06]  I'm supposed to be shopping for cars.
[2065.70 --> 2065.82]  Yeah.
[2065.84 --> 2067.90]  Because I have made a commitment to my life.
[2067.94 --> 2067.96]  Okay.
[2067.96 --> 2071.72]  I was going to say, when I drove up today, like, when it was pink and stuff, it was pretty
[2071.72 --> 2072.00]  bad.
[2072.22 --> 2075.98]  You got the dick butt on the mirror, or on the back window is pretty bad.
[2076.30 --> 2079.80]  It's bad now.
[2080.28 --> 2082.32]  Like, it's, like, a different level.
[2082.86 --> 2085.00]  It actually looks like it has a disease.
[2085.00 --> 2087.00]  I'm actually tired of it now.
[2087.12 --> 2090.54]  Like, it's the only car that I know of that I've ever looked at that I'm like, that is
[2090.54 --> 2091.64]  problematic.
[2091.96 --> 2093.20]  Like, it's not even funny.
[2093.44 --> 2093.76]  No.
[2093.90 --> 2095.22]  It's just an eyesore.
[2095.28 --> 2096.64]  It's too far.
[2096.64 --> 2097.86]  I haven't been pulled over yet.
[2098.74 --> 2100.16]  I've been daily driving it.
[2101.20 --> 2101.56]  Okay.
[2101.66 --> 2101.94]  You know what?
[2101.94 --> 2103.02]  Let's get through these leaks first.
[2103.02 --> 2108.98]  So, the 28 core part that Intel teased back at Computex is apparently going to be a brand
[2108.98 --> 2111.02]  new market segment with a different chipset and socket.
[2111.18 --> 2113.00]  I mean, anyone who knows anything would have known that.
[2113.08 --> 2114.16]  3647 socket.
[2114.72 --> 2119.62]  And then probably some kind of cut down version of their C620 whatever chipsets.
[2120.60 --> 2123.14]  There's going to be a Basin Falls refresh in November 2018.
[2123.74 --> 2124.16]  Okay.
[2124.36 --> 2125.16]  Glacier Falls.
[2125.30 --> 2126.66]  But in production later.
[2126.92 --> 2128.16]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2128.16 --> 2128.40]  Okay.
[2128.46 --> 2129.06]  So, back to the car.
[2129.72 --> 2135.92]  So, I have made a commitment to my wife that I will replace it by the time the next service
[2135.92 --> 2136.90]  period rolls around.
[2137.86 --> 2138.64]  When's the next service period?
[2138.64 --> 2144.32]  Now, I committed to that because my intention was to sort of just keep driving it.
[2144.38 --> 2144.68]  Yeah.
[2145.14 --> 2148.18]  Because there was going to be another 8,000 kilometers.
[2148.18 --> 2151.82]  It's about 5,000 miles left before it needed to be serviced again.
[2151.82 --> 2159.48]  But I'm starting to come around to getting on that a little earlier.
[2159.64 --> 2165.74]  But the stupid thing is that, honestly, look, I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[2165.82 --> 2167.04]  I can afford a new car.
[2167.76 --> 2168.04]  Yeah.
[2168.86 --> 2169.38]  Obviously.
[2169.86 --> 2173.68]  We, you know, and I don't even mean like brand new car.
[2173.92 --> 2178.20]  Like, I can afford to replace that car with something better than that car.
[2178.20 --> 2183.80]  Probably most of you watching could afford to replace that car with something better than
[2183.80 --> 2184.26]  that car.
[2184.46 --> 2187.74]  You could buy something for 500 bucks and it would probably be better than that car.
[2187.74 --> 2187.88]  Okay.
[2187.94 --> 2188.34]  Shut up.
[2189.10 --> 2190.24]  Be nice to my car.
[2190.34 --> 2190.54]  Okay.
[2190.66 --> 2190.96]  I'm not even kidding.
[2190.98 --> 2191.80]  It has served me well.
[2191.90 --> 2192.72]  No, no, no.
[2192.84 --> 2193.12]  Look.
[2193.36 --> 2193.86]  It has.
[2194.04 --> 2195.14]  I'm allowed to talk.
[2195.38 --> 2196.62]  I'm allowed to speak badly.
[2196.62 --> 2197.20]  We thought it was.
[2197.20 --> 2197.56]  You're not.
[2197.64 --> 2198.48]  We thought it was going to die.
[2198.48 --> 2199.54]  You haven't earned it.
[2199.54 --> 2204.06]  We thought it was going to die in 2013.
[2204.84 --> 2205.14]  Yeah.
[2205.58 --> 2207.60]  We were surprised it was still alive in 2013.
[2207.60 --> 2214.72]  So, so anyway, um, uh, so, so I, I, I'm getting pretty tired of it.
[2214.80 --> 2219.46]  Uh, but my original plan was to just keep driving it until that service and then figure
[2219.46 --> 2222.14]  she'd probably have gotten used to it by then and then just keep driving it.
[2222.14 --> 2224.04]  But she's not getting used to it.
[2224.84 --> 2226.16]  I'm not getting used to it.
[2226.32 --> 2227.72]  When you get your new car.
[2227.82 --> 2228.10]  Yeah.
[2230.16 --> 2231.84]  It's not exciting at all.
[2231.84 --> 2238.60]  Uh, you remember how we used, I probably, uh, used to have all those ideas of like getting
[2238.60 --> 2243.94]  a computer in the trunk and having like screens on the back of the seats.
[2244.20 --> 2244.58]  Yes.
[2244.62 --> 2246.80]  I've wanted to do that with the minivan for a while.
[2246.90 --> 2248.22]  The issue is we can't find a sponsor.
[2249.10 --> 2249.50]  Oh.
[2249.50 --> 2249.86]  Yeah.
[2250.10 --> 2254.16]  Cause we don't have the expertise to like completely rework the interior of a car to
[2254.16 --> 2254.80]  do it properly.
[2255.02 --> 2255.26]  Yeah.
[2255.54 --> 2257.50]  And so we'd want to work.
[2257.66 --> 2261.96]  We'd want to collaborate with like a shop that's capable of that, like doing a good job
[2261.96 --> 2262.26]  of it.
[2262.74 --> 2264.66]  And so there'd just be costs associated.
[2264.66 --> 2268.86]  And since it's not the kind of thing that actually has much practical use, it's not the
[2268.86 --> 2270.46]  kind of thing I just want to pay for out of pocket.
[2270.70 --> 2272.02]  Cause it wouldn't be cheap.
[2272.02 --> 2274.94]  You could actually do wireless for most of it.
[2275.04 --> 2275.26]  Yep.
[2275.26 --> 2279.38]  Like pretty much all of it, but power and mounting the monitors.
[2279.60 --> 2279.74]  Yeah.
[2279.82 --> 2281.32]  Like I wouldn't want it to be janky.
[2281.50 --> 2285.42]  So there, there are some possibilities and I don't want to get too far into it, but we
[2285.42 --> 2286.16]  have some ideas.
[2286.16 --> 2286.48]  Okay.
[2286.78 --> 2288.84]  Um, but yeah.
[2288.84 --> 2290.52]  Are you leaning towards a car at all?
[2291.52 --> 2297.52]  So that's the thing is I'm supposed to be car shopping cause I have agreed and I want
[2297.52 --> 2302.00]  to, I ended up spending probably a grand total of about 40 minutes.
[2302.02 --> 2303.24]  Car shopping.
[2303.38 --> 2303.62]  Okay.
[2303.66 --> 2306.28]  And since then, all I've been researching is motorcycles.
[2308.86 --> 2313.42]  There are some super cool electric motorcycles out there now.
[2315.46 --> 2317.60]  So I'd never really had any desire.
[2317.60 --> 2318.52]  But you have one.
[2318.52 --> 2318.88]  I know.
[2318.98 --> 2319.58]  I know.
[2319.68 --> 2320.00]  I know.
[2320.10 --> 2320.40]  Shut up.
[2320.48 --> 2325.22]  I'd never had any desire to replace my SV650S.
[2325.30 --> 2329.38]  It's a 2003, but that's the first year that it had fuel injection.
[2330.32 --> 2330.50]  Okay.
[2330.60 --> 2330.90]  Question.
[2331.14 --> 2332.00]  It's a sidebar question.
[2332.16 --> 2333.18]  Does that bike have ABS?
[2333.40 --> 2333.74]  Good bike.
[2333.98 --> 2335.12]  Ah, no, it doesn't.
[2335.22 --> 2338.28]  Cause that like wasn't a thing that blew my mind.
[2338.40 --> 2340.00]  That's apparently a newer thing on bikes.
[2340.30 --> 2340.62]  ABS.
[2340.74 --> 2340.86]  Yeah.
[2340.94 --> 2341.14]  Yeah.
[2341.26 --> 2341.44]  Yeah.
[2341.72 --> 2342.04]  Weird.
[2342.20 --> 2343.54]  So yeah, no, my bike doesn't have ABS.
[2343.54 --> 2348.00]  It's pretty bare bones, but it's got the V twin engine, which I really like.
[2348.08 --> 2350.22]  It's got lots of pull in the low RPM range.
[2350.22 --> 2355.10]  Um, it's, it's, it's actually, especially now that I'm more used to it, it's really light.
[2355.56 --> 2359.06]  Uh, like it's not light compared to a dual sport or something, but it's, but it's, it's,
[2359.14 --> 2359.62]  it's light.
[2359.74 --> 2360.44]  It's maneuverable.
[2360.44 --> 2369.08]  It's a full, and it's honestly got enough power that unless you're an idiot, you don't really need more than that.
[2369.08 --> 2375.46]  like if you're doing anything other than going in a straight line um there's not much reason to have
[2375.46 --> 2381.30]  much more power than that at least on the road like on the track whole different story whatever
[2381.30 --> 2390.52]  talk about your favorite track bike amongst yourselves please um but there's there's there's
[2390.52 --> 2397.68]  this bike called the lightning that shut up zero to 60 trying to roast me about a chair zero to 60
[2397.68 --> 2401.88]  that was like recommended by a physiotherapist because my back has problems and you want to
[2401.88 --> 2407.66]  replace your car with a bike and you already have a perfectly good bike zero to 60 in two seconds
[2407.66 --> 2413.88]  how do you stay on it i want to find out
[2413.88 --> 2423.22]  oh my goodness oh man oh is this your so is this your midlife crisis you know the funny thing about
[2423.22 --> 2427.54]  it is i've always joked with my wife like i couldn't possibly have a midlife crisis because
[2427.54 --> 2432.84]  i've been midlife crisising my whole life like i bought a motorcycle like eight years ago yeah right
[2432.84 --> 2443.90]  yeah yeah um so so the thing that the thing about bikes is that they're cheap and by cheap i don't
[2443.90 --> 2450.88]  mean that forty thousand dollars isn't a lot of money i mean that for literally the fastest bike on
[2450.88 --> 2457.66]  the planet compared to literally the fastest car on the planet we're talking an order of magnitude
[2457.66 --> 2468.00]  difference in price yeah so for the price of like a basic minivan which i recently purchased you could
[2468.00 --> 2476.88]  have the fastest bike on the planet zero to 60 in two seconds but you can't even use it
[2476.88 --> 2483.58]  oh you can accelerate especially in electric electric motors dangerous takeoff
[2483.58 --> 2491.68]  yeah you can if your wheel spins i'd love to learn to do a wheelie that's also not legal and the 650
[2491.68 --> 2498.56]  yeah on the road it's legal to do it elsewhere they have like they have like stunt riding courses
[2498.56 --> 2504.70]  and stuff like that'd be a lot of fun shut up yeah anyway anyway so i'm supposed to be shopping for a car
[2504.70 --> 2511.66]  i have actually spent the vast majority of my time shopping for a bike now with that said so would you
[2511.66 --> 2512.26]  sell yours
[2512.26 --> 2523.34]  range on the lightning i think is like 150 200 miles also someone in the uh someone in the chat had a
[2523.34 --> 2531.52]  question what is the uh mileage or kilometers on your lambo on the lambo it's about 200 and it's
[2531.52 --> 2537.26]  a little over 220 000 this is just the wrong thing 220 000 yeah a little over 220 000 kilometers there you
[2537.26 --> 2545.14]  go um what the crap is this you know what's great is the mobile version has shut up the mobile version
[2545.14 --> 2550.02]  of chrome has a thing where when you're stuck in one of these back loops where it just keeps reloading
[2550.02 --> 2554.94]  like it forwards you a few times so you can't spam click back to get back yeah on the mobile version
[2554.94 --> 2558.98]  you can tell it don't let this page bring up any more prompts but the desktop version doesn't
[2558.98 --> 2567.70]  that's lame this owns a lambo oh welcome to the party dude uh yeah sure uh we're talking about my civic
[2567.70 --> 2576.26]  it's a joke it is a super le joke yeah so this this is this is the thing i've been looking at
[2576.26 --> 2585.20]  that's a nice looking and by looking at i mean drooling over oh it's so beautiful um don't don't
[2585.20 --> 2591.14]  look at don't look at this wow don't look at that kind of thing okay um let's see i'm just trying to
[2591.14 --> 2598.00]  remember the range yeah okay so the 20 kilowatt hour battery pack is 160 to 100 and uh yeah 100 miles
[2598.00 --> 2604.12]  range at highway speed but there's different battery pack options so they're probably talking about this
[2604.12 --> 2608.50]  i love how you knew that the basic yeah no i i knew there were different batteries a couple things i still
[2608.50 --> 2613.94]  don't like it's pretty heavy it's significantly heavier than mine battery packs i'm assuming
[2613.94 --> 2620.28]  yeah it's probably mostly on the batteries but so okay i haven't actually pitched this to the wife
[2620.28 --> 2626.42]  yet but let me let me try something out on you and see how it goes okay first i need to know though
[2626.42 --> 2631.92]  yes because this would be important for her as well for sure are you selling your bike
[2631.92 --> 2636.52]  sure i'll sell my bike i don't really have anywhere to keep it and are are you then not replacing the
[2636.52 --> 2643.18]  car oh no i'm i'll replace the car so you're gonna get this and a car okay just just shut up shut up
[2643.18 --> 2648.02]  okay she's gonna hold on hold on yeah yeah yeah okay so let's ask you things so so pretty much
[2648.02 --> 2655.18]  everyone and their dog has been like you're a tech guy get a model s that's boring okay right well
[2655.18 --> 2660.04]  that's kind actually that's kind of my response to that because the funny thing about the super civic
[2660.04 --> 2669.82]  is that it's horrible but if your car is supposed to be a reflection of something about you like your
[2669.82 --> 2677.30]  car does say something about you the super civic for better or for worse is the linus mobile so you
[2677.30 --> 2683.44]  want something rolling fast and electric because you're super fast no no no that's no no it's not
[2683.44 --> 2687.30]  that it's not that i just mean i mean it's been it's been this is a reflection of your personality
[2687.30 --> 2690.78]  been hard for no no i'm not talking about this right now i just mean it's been hard for me to
[2690.78 --> 2697.98]  replace the super civic for multiple reasons one i hate car shopping yeah two it really is such a it
[2697.98 --> 2704.72]  is such a perfect fit for me not now but it was it was before it got a little too far now it's too
[2704.72 --> 2711.60]  much it was the soup it was the zero f's mobile yeah super practical yeah reliable cheap cheap
[2711.60 --> 2716.98]  standard super cheap standard everything even windows yeah that i wasn't a fan of no the windows
[2716.98 --> 2723.38]  are okay no ac was a problem though yeah um it's getting worse every year it's really bad metal heat
[2723.38 --> 2729.38]  wave recently it sucked um anyway so it's been like the me mobile and it's been hard to find something
[2729.38 --> 2736.06]  that says anything about me a model s doesn't no that's my issue with the model s yeah the model s
[2736.06 --> 2740.32]  says absolutely nothing about linus sebastian the person other than oh you're a tech guy i get a model s
[2740.32 --> 2747.20]  i'm like okay it's also really expensive it's also really expensive but but based on that
[2747.20 --> 2752.16]  everyone's telling me to buy a model s i figure people won't be like mad if i say look i haven't
[2752.16 --> 2756.74]  replaced my car in 10 years i'm getting a model s do you think people would resent that i don't think
[2756.74 --> 2762.26]  people would be mad i don't think it works for you i think it's ludicrously expensive okay okay so
[2762.26 --> 2768.56]  so let's assume that people you know and there's no right to repair on model s's on tesla i've heard a
[2768.56 --> 2773.82]  about this recently oh right to repair on this is like like tesla and right to repair are like not
[2773.82 --> 2778.66]  friends which this is i've very recently heard about this but that's not a that's not so i'm
[2778.66 --> 2782.16]  gonna pitch something here i'm gonna pitch something here for the cost of one model s
[2782.16 --> 2791.34]  i could get a clarity plug-in hybrid and you're for the daily commute and a super bike that doesn't
[2791.34 --> 2796.98]  mean you're supposed to spend that much money it means that i could but it doesn't mean that you're
[2796.98 --> 2803.36]  supposed to and it would be the same as if i got a model s but you shouldn't have gotten a model s
[2803.36 --> 2809.04]  but i but you probably shouldn't do this okay i want to hear from twitch chat i need a second
[2809.04 --> 2816.60]  opinion of course they're gonna tell you a second opinion second opinion um okay okay people are
[2816.60 --> 2824.84]  like mkbhd got a model s that makes a lot of sense don't know about linus um okay um i could
[2824.84 --> 2832.34]  but am i gonna super bike means midlife crisis dude dude dude what okay vaughn can i pitch you
[2832.34 --> 2839.88]  something this is really important okay so so okay we need a straw poll no no you gotta you gotta
[2839.88 --> 2844.50]  come on land show for a minute here can you can you straw poll it up okay so i i give her my seat
[2844.50 --> 2849.62]  no no no no no she can just she can come she can come sit with me we're we're we're good friends
[2849.62 --> 2855.28]  here you guys hang out sometimes yeah we we can we're not afraid of a little bit of physical contact
[2855.28 --> 2861.00]  made three babies you know okay ow all the keys in my pocket are killing my thigh you're why are you
[2861.00 --> 2866.00]  still so bad at this what killing my killing my lap actually i also have a keyboard in my pocket that's
[2866.00 --> 2871.96]  not okay okay okay okay okay okay i need to i need to reach the thing okay so i'm gonna what is
[2871.96 --> 2875.60]  the straw poll question i run something by you get it or don't get it because we don't want to tell
[2875.60 --> 2883.14]  her what's going on yet okay so model s um costs are we really i had the same reaction i had the same
[2883.14 --> 2890.54]  reaction just a second okay okay so the model s costs uh why is it why do they just put loan what
[2890.54 --> 2896.14]  what is what is the difference between lease and loan that's stupid like what is a what is a loan
[2896.14 --> 2900.16]  no a loan i think is when you get financing oh financing why don't they just say financing
[2900.16 --> 2907.62]  well that is what that means okay so a model s uh is anywhere from okay the federal tax credit this
[2907.62 --> 2914.56]  is u.s oh crap okay well whatever it's about 85 000 canadian plus whatever i mean i would there's
[2914.56 --> 2919.06]  no way i wouldn't get the autopilot upgrade and stuff like that so let's say about 80 to 90 000 canadian
[2919.06 --> 2926.28]  okay so would i be allowed to get a model s why i thought you didn't want a model that's not the
[2926.28 --> 2928.92]  point that's not the point you didn't want the model s you didn't want the model x okay
[2928.92 --> 2935.66]  so would i be allowed to get one i don't know it just has to make sense okay but could i could i
[2935.66 --> 2937.54]  make some kind of argument that that would make sense
[2937.54 --> 2951.12]  no what probably not actually okay why because it's not practical it's not really seat seven
[2951.12 --> 2957.30]  it's not really you seat seven a minivan seats how many people and costs a fraction of that
[2957.30 --> 2966.46]  okay yeah this much may be true okay um i mean okay so so from a practicality standpoint no but if
[2966.46 --> 2970.48]  it was just like i really want this okay you could probably make that argument okay i can make good
[2970.48 --> 2976.92]  good good good okay that's all i need that's all i need okay so now how about this how about a very
[2976.92 --> 2985.52]  practical car that costs half as much and a super bike that also costs half as much
[2985.52 --> 2990.94]  how about that you're not getting the super bike
[2990.94 --> 2999.40]  but it's a lightning zero to 60 in two seconds two seconds does that sound like a good thing for
[2999.40 --> 3002.78]  the father of your children don't want you to die we have life insurance now
[3002.78 --> 3005.20]  she said that's so excited
[3005.20 --> 3013.12]  all right thank you well it was worth a shot
[3013.12 --> 3019.54]  oh my goodness you know it's funny that was fantastic i would say i should just do it anyway
[3019.54 --> 3024.32]  oh i have to go don't i we all have to go actually okay i would say that i should just do it anyway
[3024.32 --> 3030.34]  but the cold hard truth is she completely controls all the money yeah i wouldn't be able to buy a
[3030.34 --> 3034.80]  hamburger without her knowing about it like it's actually a problem like i can't surprise her with
[3034.80 --> 3042.02]  a gift or anything because all the credit cards draw cash it's actually yeah but if i withdrew cash
[3042.02 --> 3047.54]  it would seem very unusual if it was any more than like 100 bucks here and there like i like to carry a
[3047.54 --> 3052.68]  little bit of cash because um a lot of places in richmond only take cash yeah but that's the only reason i
[3052.68 --> 3058.78]  carry cash so unless i like flipped something on craigslist recently i don't have a ton of i don't
[3058.78 --> 3063.06]  have a ton of cash on hand so if she saw like you know a few hundred dollars come out of the account
[3063.06 --> 3067.44]  she'd be like hey does someone have your card someone have your pin yeah like no no uh well what
[3067.44 --> 3071.90]  was this what was this withdrawal because it's literally her job like actually her job every day
[3071.90 --> 3076.68]  to keep track of all the money yeah no no it's not like a control freak thing she's just
[3076.68 --> 3085.04]  literally the financial officer of both our family and our company so yeah there'd be okay well
[3085.04 --> 3089.06]  let me let me see the straw poll can i at least see the straw poll results i haven't even seen it
[3089.06 --> 3094.50]  okay what's uh what's the url here is it case sensitive oh it's pretty close
