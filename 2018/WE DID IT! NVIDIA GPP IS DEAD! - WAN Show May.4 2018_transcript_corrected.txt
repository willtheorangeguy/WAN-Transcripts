[0.00 → 0.48] Yes.
[1.80 → 4.14] Hey, and welcome to the show.
[4.28 → 5.16] This is the WAN show.
[5.42 → 6.16] The WAN show, that is.
[6.36 → 7.22] Or the NAH?
[7.36 → 8.36] The NAH show.
[8.54 → 8.90] NAH.
[9.02 → 9.46] NAH.
[10.32 → 12.04] News and Analysis Weekly.
[12.22 → 13.36] News and Analysis Weekly, baby.
[13.54 → 14.72] It actually totally works.
[15.16 → 15.72] NAH.
[17.98 → 19.08] It kind of does.
[19.12 → 20.20] That's a W. That wins.
[20.48 → 21.08] Yeah, yeah.
[21.22 → 21.42] All right.
[21.50 → 22.00] WAN show.
[22.14 → 22.86] Welcome to it.
[22.96 → 24.30] We're doing some news stuff.
[24.78 → 27.12] There's the GPP is no longer a thing news,
[27.12 → 29.84] which I'm sure every single person in the tech community
[29.84 → 30.98] is going to be talking about a lot.
[31.12 → 31.40] Boom!
[31.52 → 33.64] Because there's not a ton else going on.
[33.72 → 36.32] So, you know, we'll take whatever we can.
[36.40 → 38.62] Feels like a win, too, but who actually knows?
[38.68 → 39.48] We're going to get into that.
[39.82 → 44.52] Also, T-Mobile and Sprint are trying to two become one again.
[44.64 → 47.40] Hug each other a little bit more than they did in the past, you know?
[47.52 → 48.28] They tried it before.
[48.60 → 48.86] Yeah.
[49.10 → 49.78] They're trying again.
[50.00 → 50.22] Yeah.
[50.72 → 51.92] Also, DRAM price fixing.
[52.08 → 52.88] We've all kind of known.
[53.02 → 54.56] It's been kind of ridiculous for a while.
[54.96 → 56.58] It's weird how expensive this stuff is.
[56.58 → 58.48] So, when you're pricing on a computer, and then you're like,
[58.60 → 59.16] whoa!
[59.90 → 60.76] That was unexpected.
[61.06 → 61.34] Anyway.
[61.50 → 62.64] I'm looking at the analytics lately.
[63.30 → 63.96] It's bad.
[64.30 → 64.78] It's bad.
[64.86 → 65.00] Yeah.
[65.20 → 66.44] That plus Facebook stuff.
[66.70 → 66.96] Yeah.
[67.22 → 68.50] All that and more on the NAH show.
[69.74 → 70.70] On the NAH show.
[70.74 → 71.92] I'm champing at the bit here.
[76.44 → 79.12] Who thought of that clench thing?
[79.32 → 79.82] I don't know.
[80.60 → 81.48] Ed, technically.
[82.76 → 83.76] That's hilarious.
[83.76 → 86.86] Originally, we were going to have a new one of these like every week.
[86.98 → 88.70] And then I think we made one.
[89.10 → 90.04] And then never again.
[90.16 → 90.34] Yeah.
[90.48 → 90.76] Obviously.
[91.02 → 91.70] That plan.
[92.14 → 92.88] Which one's you there?
[92.92 → 93.58] Fresh books!
[93.72 → 93.88] I know.
[94.10 → 95.10] Fresh books!
[95.20 → 96.14] The one in the blue sweater.
[96.46 → 98.12] Because I used to always wear that same sweater.
[98.20 → 98.86] The shorter one.
[98.86 → 99.56] I used to always wear the same shirt.
[100.20 → 100.44] Looks.
[102.12 → 103.10] I don't know.
[103.10 → 103.80] Thank you, PIA.
[104.58 → 104.94] PIA!
[104.94 → 106.28] I appreciate your stuff.
[108.24 → 108.76] You don't have dark hair.
[108.76 → 109.26] And Squarespace!
[109.26 → 110.38] Thank you very much.
[110.78 → 112.54] My hair changes depending on the season.
[113.80 → 115.02] What season are you a redhead?
[115.26 → 115.66] Weird.
[115.94 → 116.46] Oh my.
[117.36 → 118.64] Only in Vegas, baby.
[121.60 → 122.36] Ginger Luke.
[122.56 → 123.80] Oh, that would be great.
[124.02 → 124.62] Ginger B.
[124.94 → 128.44] We're going to start off the show with a folding and point community shout out.
[128.54 → 131.24] We have one of those things on the forum.
[131.64 → 131.82] Yeah.
[131.96 → 133.02] I didn't even know what it was.
[133.34 → 133.64] Oh.
[133.90 → 134.54] I had no idea.
[134.54 → 135.22] I got hurt.
[135.32 → 136.38] I've heard of distributed.
[136.60 → 138.82] Oh, I thought you just didn't know what our team was.
[138.82 → 140.48] I had no idea what the folding thing was.
[140.68 → 144.56] I got a message from one of the members of our folding team who was like, can you give
[144.56 → 145.12] us a shout-out?
[145.50 → 146.72] And I was like, what are you?
[146.82 → 148.58] What is folding slash brink?
[149.12 → 149.44] What?
[149.78 → 150.70] And then I was checking it out.
[150.74 → 151.92] I was like, oh, this is amazing.
[152.56 → 153.34] I want to do this.
[153.40 → 154.48] I think I might set it up.
[154.72 → 154.92] Yeah.
[154.98 → 157.36] So we have a community on the forum dedicated to folding and brink.
[157.52 → 162.18] Folding and brink is more like, brink can be a lot of things.
[162.26 → 163.04] I know what that is.
[163.32 → 164.32] It's Friday, baby.
[164.32 → 170.56] Uh, folding at home is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates
[170.56 → 175.96] protein folding, which is why it's called folding at home because you're folding proteins digitally
[175.96 → 176.92] at home.
[177.22 → 181.32] Uh, and computational drug design and other types of molecular dynamics.
[181.32 → 182.92] It's this really cool thing.
[182.92 → 187.16] And brink can do stuff similar to that or sort of not.
[187.60 → 189.38] And this kind of research takes a lot of computing power.
[189.46 → 190.40] So that's why it's distributed.
[190.56 → 195.06] So you can help out and actually chip away at cancer research or Alzheimer's research just
[195.06 → 199.66] by using your spare compute cycles on your piece of crap PC that's in your storage room.
[199.74 → 200.60] Like I plan to do.
[200.94 → 202.92] Or, you know, those mining machines.
[203.82 → 204.68] You don't say.
[204.68 → 210.20] You could, you could repurpose those to help in cancer if you wanted to, or you could not,
[210.88 → 213.34] you know, whatever, whatever folds your boat.
[213.60 → 214.38] Ha ha.
[214.48 → 215.50] Oh, ho ho.
[215.98 → 217.48] Uh, are there foldable boats?
[217.72 → 218.44] Sensible chuckles.
[218.78 → 219.60] Uh, well, theoretically.
[219.60 → 219.88] Inflatable.
[220.16 → 221.22] If you deflate a boat.
[221.34 → 222.40] And then you can fold it.
[222.90 → 224.20] Into the shape of a protein.
[224.74 → 225.18] Ha ha.
[226.66 → 227.96] Anyway, moving on to like.
[227.96 → 228.42] So wait a second.
[228.80 → 229.08] Okay.
[229.08 → 229.64] All right.
[230.02 → 231.48] These people on the folding team.
[231.56 → 231.78] Yes.
[231.86 → 233.10] You can do this at any point, right?
[233.10 → 237.48] Like you can turn on, you can, but they also do these like, like bursts.
[237.64 → 237.82] Yeah.
[237.90 → 242.40] They do these weeks when they all try really hard to, to devote as much of their computing
[242.40 → 243.34] power as they can to do it.
[243.38 → 247.10] And sometimes it'll be like a competition kind of set up where there's like leaderboards
[247.66 → 249.00] for how different teams are doing.
[249.04 → 249.18] Yeah.
[249.18 → 249.32] Yeah.
[249.32 → 249.48] Yeah.
[249.48 → 252.84] So they'll, they'll be like, oh, like who can make the most of this week or whatever.
[252.90 → 253.92] And we're like in the top 20.
[254.08 → 255.18] We do, we do pretty good.
[255.18 → 256.42] And I've contributed nothing to this.
[257.86 → 258.88] Let's get it.
[259.08 → 260.14] Let's get it.
[260.14 → 266.70] Speaking of getting something, no longer are you going to get NVIDIA GPP.
[267.62 → 270.56] Oh, I thought you were going to say like get screwed by GPP.
[271.00 → 272.98] You might, you might still get screwed by GPP.
[273.58 → 273.84] Okay.
[273.84 → 279.64] So just to catch up the people who don't know what the NVIDIA G-Force partner program was,
[279.78 → 285.06] it was basically like, if you're a partner of NVIDIA, like you're a, oh no, this guy.
[285.40 → 286.16] What are your thoughts?
[286.24 → 286.74] Quick before you go.
[286.74 → 287.56] We won.
[287.56 → 289.84] Victory is ours.
[290.12 → 290.94] You're behind the mic.
[293.74 → 295.16] Congratulations are in order.
[295.42 → 296.34] We did, we did win.
[296.44 → 298.44] But again, back to what it actually is.
[298.58 → 298.92] Team effort.
[298.92 → 299.56] Team effort.
[299.94 → 300.14] Yeah.
[300.38 → 304.22] The entire press got together and made this thing not a thing.
[304.54 → 304.80] Yep.
[304.98 → 305.46] Go team.
[305.52 → 306.82] Have you read their, their.
[306.94 → 307.62] Oh, it's terrible.
[307.82 → 308.24] It's terrible.
[308.54 → 308.68] Yeah.
[308.84 → 310.52] Anyway, he doesn't get to talk about it.
[310.62 → 310.96] We do.
[311.16 → 311.82] So continue.
[312.16 → 312.66] Ha ha ha.
[312.66 → 318.22] Let's say you are Asus, and you're, you sign up for the NVIDIA GPP.
[319.78 → 328.98] If, if you wanted to sell an NVIDIA graphics card with your special like DOG branding,
[328.98 → 329.74] because you're Asus.
[329.94 → 330.10] Yeah.
[330.10 → 332.68] You couldn't sell any other graphics cards with that branding.
[333.28 → 338.36] I don't think that the it stipulates that like, hey, your existing branding, DOG, you've
[338.36 → 339.42] got to use that for NVIDIA.
[339.54 → 342.82] I think it's up to Asus to decide what branding they use.
[342.92 → 345.14] In theory, they could have been like, you know what, NVIDIA?
[345.86 → 349.16] We're going to use our awesome DOG branding on the Radeon cards.
[349.16 → 350.92] And we're going to make new branding for you.
[351.16 → 355.70] That would, so from a company's perspective though, that would generally be bad because
[355.70 → 358.12] the majority of the market is NVIDIA purchasers.
[358.24 → 358.54] Exactly.
[358.54 → 360.96] So you want to use your stronger brand for that because you'll make more money.
[361.02 → 361.42] Exactly.
[361.58 → 363.40] So they're totally cutting out.
[364.02 → 365.86] And this mind share really matters, right?
[365.88 → 369.96] Because what they're forcing and what did actually occur when this program rolled out
[369.96 → 374.38] was that you've got to make new product lines, new, you've got to fork your branding
[374.38 → 374.66] basically.
[374.76 → 375.68] And so they made Aries.
[376.64 → 378.86] This comes at a considerable expense, by the way.
[378.86 → 379.32] Oh yeah.
[379.54 → 380.26] They've got to...
[380.26 → 381.04] Branding, marketing.
[381.22 → 382.08] They've got to design it.
[382.16 → 384.36] They've got to iterate on that.
[384.44 → 387.46] Then they've got to actually print boxes, get these boxes on the shelves.
[388.06 → 391.34] And presumably at this point, these companies have already done all of that.
[391.70 → 396.82] So now that the partner program is cancelled, everybody's wondering if Aries is going to
[396.82 → 399.00] continue to be a thing or if they're just going to switch back.
[399.44 → 400.94] Because on the one hand, they have the sunk cost.
[401.08 → 404.84] On the other hand, that brand means nothing to anybody yet.
[404.92 → 406.92] So it's better to lean on your existing brand.
[406.92 → 411.20] What we don't know is if NVIDIA has remunerated these companies.
[411.38 → 415.96] Like let's say Aries has sunk millions on rebranding, or at least hundreds of thousands.
[416.58 → 420.82] Is NVIDIA, like did the lawyer set up anything for this particular case where NVIDIA is going
[420.82 → 421.24] to be like, okay.
[424.00 → 426.38] So you guys probably didn't hear that.
[426.64 → 427.80] What happened?
[427.80 → 433.22] Was it the Teleprompter glass?
[433.36 → 434.40] I would go help him.
[437.70 → 438.68] Are you all right?
[439.64 → 440.88] Dennis is dead, everyone.
[441.36 → 446.78] So a glass fell and shattered into a lot of pieces as we were able to hear from here.
[446.94 → 448.64] I guess, yeah, you guys definitely can hear that.
[448.76 → 451.08] We just heard shattering and then Dennis going, no!
[451.18 → 452.50] Oh yeah, it was very audible.
[452.50 → 452.90] Yeah.
[453.62 → 454.42] Anyway, sorry.
[454.54 → 455.72] We're going to continue here.
[455.80 → 458.64] But yeah, it's unclear at this time whether brands are going to survive.
[459.14 → 463.50] Not as in like whether ASUS will survive, but it's unclear whether Aries will survive,
[463.80 → 467.94] whether NVIDIA will be compensating these brands for the work that they did relate
[467.94 → 468.64] to GPP.
[468.64 → 476.56] In the like who knows how accurate it was leaks that we got, I didn't see any provisions
[476.56 → 480.16] for that because I don't think NVIDIA was expecting to have to pull back out.
[481.20 → 483.38] But I guess we didn't see the other side of the agreement either.
[483.70 → 487.34] Well, it would have been what those particular companies' lawyers came up with.
[487.34 → 487.72] Exactly.
[487.84 → 488.88] So we didn't see the other side.
[488.94 → 490.08] It wouldn't be in the original TOS.
[491.20 → 494.96] Another interesting thing was how they framed their cancellation.
[494.96 → 498.06] So we learned about it through a blog post that NVIDIA uploaded.
[498.54 → 501.32] And they did not, they didn't like Facebook it.
[501.54 → 502.82] They didn't go on an apology tour.
[502.92 → 504.04] They didn't own what they did.
[504.04 → 504.40] Oh no.
[504.62 → 506.66] Instead, they framed it thusly.
[507.14 → 515.46] You know, there's all these rumours and conjecture and myths, mis truths around about the NVIDIA
[515.46 → 516.18] GPP.
[516.18 → 524.40] So rather than spending our energy battling misinformation, we're just going to cancel
[524.40 → 529.20] the program so we can focus on what's important, like building the new technology, like as if
[529.20 → 532.06] the GPP and all the backlash was like draining their resources.
[532.40 → 535.72] As if all the technical people at NVIDIA were quick working on marketing.
[535.94 → 536.06] Yeah.
[536.06 → 538.84] Like the engineers were like, I can't focus because everyone hates us.
[538.94 → 539.98] This is a PR nightmare.
[540.76 → 541.96] This is so brutal.
[541.96 → 547.94] So yeah, they didn't, yeah, it's that, that part is so brutal because a lot of the reason
[547.94 → 551.44] why this is all come to light was because of people, I don't remember his name right
[551.44 → 555.94] now, but from the, the guy from Hard OCP, um, that, that like pushed all this kind of
[555.94 → 558.18] stuff and the rest of the media, not just us at all.
[558.26 → 563.16] We, we probably had a relatively small involvement because I think we just talked about it during
[563.16 → 566.24] when there are other creators that have made dedicated videos and all this kind of stuff.
[566.24 → 566.52] When?
[566.98 → 567.26] When?
[567.38 → 568.38] Oh, the NAH show.
[568.58 → 569.04] Oh yeah.
[569.24 → 569.90] Sorry about that.
[569.90 → 570.18] Yeah.
[570.56 → 572.02] A lot of confusion around the name.
[572.36 → 574.10] Uh, but there's been a lot of.
[574.10 → 575.34] NVIDIA made us rebrand.
[576.04 → 579.38] It's the NAH show with Radeon graphics.
[579.58 → 582.90] Anytime we talk about AMD graphics cards, that's going to be on the NAH show.
[583.18 → 583.86] That's awesome.
[584.44 → 585.00] That's awesome.
[585.22 → 588.02] Each, each, each week we have half an hour for WAN, half an hour for NAH.
[588.12 → 588.32] Sorry.
[588.80 → 589.74] Um, yeah.
[589.80 → 594.02] So it's just, all this stuff was brought to light.
[594.46 → 598.80] There was basically nothing from NVIDIA explaining what was going on.
[598.80 → 600.08] They, they're complaining at the beginning.
[600.20 → 604.98] All the rumours, conjecture, mis truths go far beyond its intent.
[605.08 → 607.58] Well, maybe better explain its intent.
[607.74 → 612.18] I know there was one post talking about it, but it was so whimsical and didn't properly
[612.18 → 613.84] go through what's actually happening.
[613.88 → 614.06] Yes.
[614.12 → 614.58] Total BS.
[614.70 → 619.12] They keep focusing on the fact that this is all about transparency for the consumer.
[619.12 → 621.10] So the consumer knows what they're buying.
[621.10 → 624.78] They know that they're getting an NVIDIA card and that's the best thing you can get.
[624.84 → 627.86] And they want to make sure, and it's very obvious and transparent on the packaging that
[627.86 → 628.64] that's what they're getting.
[629.28 → 633.40] If that's what it's about, then why even rely on these other brands like DOG?
[633.74 → 637.20] Why don't you just stipulate that they have a big fat green banner that says NVIDIA on
[637.20 → 637.30] it?
[637.34 → 640.12] If it's really just about obvious branding.
[640.38 → 645.10] They kind of do, like I've, I've never, I've heard a lot of complaints from new system
[645.10 → 645.40] builders.
[645.40 → 647.98] I've helped a lot of people get into building their computers.
[648.12 → 651.92] And one of my big things when I would help friends or family or whoever build a computer
[651.92 → 655.90] was always that I'll be there as like the guiding hand, but I want them to do it.
[656.00 → 657.34] I want them to pick the parts.
[657.44 → 660.90] I would want them to build the computer, but I can help them with anything and answer whatever
[660.90 → 661.98] questions, et cetera, et cetera.
[662.16 → 662.66] Eating snacks.
[663.02 → 663.26] Yeah.
[664.00 → 667.98] Getting free pop because they would supply for the event.
[667.98 → 669.96] Is there going to be chips and pop that I'm in?
[670.26 → 672.02] My hands will be too crummy to help you.
[672.02 → 674.44] There's one buddy of mine that I've built two computers for.
[674.44 → 676.82] And every time we do, he brings a case of vanilla Coke.
[677.22 → 678.36] I like this deal.
[678.44 → 679.48] It's worked out quite well.
[680.14 → 686.82] But it's, I've never had a single person be like, I don't understand.
[687.68 → 689.14] I'm buying DOG.
[689.28 → 692.08] Why is it an AMD thing or whatever?
[692.16 → 693.68] Like I've never had that confusion.
[693.88 → 695.12] Everyone seems to get it.
[695.90 → 699.24] So all this hubbub over that seems unlikely.
[700.06 → 704.04] It feels like they just wanted to muscle them out of the good brands.
[704.04 → 705.00] Yeah, exactly.
[705.14 → 708.14] They know that their market position is such that they're going to be the ones awarded
[708.14 → 710.60] the DOG, the incumbent existing branding.
[711.08 → 714.84] And that AMD is going to be the one suffering under the new branding.
[715.44 → 717.22] So nice try, NVIDIA.
[717.22 → 717.30] Yeah.
[718.10 → 718.46] Yeah.
[719.80 → 726.84] Evan33 is spamming contrast in the chat so much that I'm super surprised that he's not
[726.84 → 729.00] banned from the chat by the bot yet.
[729.54 → 734.00] I don't know if he's talking about contrast in terms of like what this picture looks like
[734.00 → 736.04] or if he's talking about between the boxes.
[736.66 → 740.28] But in my experience, it's pretty, this probably isn't even what he's talking about.
[740.28 → 743.94] But in my experience, it's pretty easy to differentiate between which one is an NVIDIA card and which
[743.94 → 744.90] one is an AMD card.
[744.92 → 748.90] No, he's definitely talking about the visuals of this video feed.
[749.12 → 750.12] But we don't care.
[750.28 → 750.86] Yeah, man.
[750.92 → 753.20] We're going to make it about graphics cards.
[753.42 → 754.56] It's intentional, dude.
[754.66 → 755.82] This is the new style.
[756.16 → 756.38] Yeah.
[757.02 → 758.72] Low or high contrast or whatever.
[758.76 → 760.58] The opposite of whatever you're complaining about.
[760.76 → 761.60] That's what we want.
[761.60 → 764.80] We don't understand it, but whatever.
[765.48 → 771.82] So, yeah, I'm not like, and I know that a lot of people at NVIDIA, and I'm sure they're
[771.82 → 773.80] paying attention to a lot of the press stuff around this.
[773.84 → 777.26] So they might see this section of the show at some point in time.
[777.46 → 779.76] Guys, you got to figure out your public communication.
[780.00 → 781.16] You make great graphics cards.
[781.34 → 783.96] You have the market share, the giant market share.
[784.06 → 787.46] I know you're very happy about that, but people are kind of pissed off.
[787.50 → 789.54] And I know it's very easy for the community.
[789.64 → 790.58] I know you guys know this.
[790.58 → 795.48] It's very easy for the community to go after the company that has the lion's market share.
[796.26 → 797.50] The lion's share of the market.
[797.72 → 799.30] It's very easy for that to happen.
[799.38 → 803.12] And that's definitely a non-insignificant amount of what's going on.
[803.20 → 806.26] But especially around GPP, the communication was bad.
[807.08 → 808.84] You have to understand the communication was bad.
[808.92 → 810.22] And this didn't help.
[810.80 → 817.62] With everyone needing to dive in and dig and glean and fight for every little tiny bit of information
[817.62 → 818.22] that they could.
[818.22 → 825.14] And for you to come back at it by saying, oh, yeah, there are so many rumours, conjecture, mis truths
[825.14 → 825.88] are going around everywhere.
[826.58 → 827.38] Clarify better.
[828.14 → 829.68] That's on you, man.
[830.14 → 832.88] And I know it got leaked or whatever.
[833.06 → 834.38] And that sucks as a company.
[834.46 → 835.62] I completely understand that.
[835.64 → 836.62] That's super frustrating.
[836.62 → 842.82] But at that point in time, throwing at other people for that is not going to help you.
[843.42 → 848.34] To try to win everyone else onto your side, you need to be open to the community and try
[848.34 → 854.52] to explain what was going on in a not so whimsical and were just fairies on the breeze kind of
[854.52 → 854.76] way.
[854.84 → 856.28] Because that's obviously not what's going on.
[856.40 → 857.60] Give me your opinion on this part.
[857.60 → 862.14] A lot of people think that them cancelling the program doesn't really amount to much
[862.14 → 863.38] because the damage is already done.
[864.18 → 865.86] There's sunk costs.
[866.44 → 867.56] There's these new brands.
[870.48 → 874.14] There could be back alley, or what do you call them?
[874.68 → 875.30] Back alley deals?
[875.46 → 875.98] Back end deals?
[876.10 → 876.52] Back end.
[876.84 → 877.22] Back end?
[877.22 → 877.82] Back end.
[878.62 → 883.08] These deals could continue to exist right now, just not publicly.
[883.22 → 884.76] You could even name it something else or whatever, yeah.
[885.94 → 890.58] Because a lot of these big players, they sign these agreements, so they might just carry
[890.58 → 891.16] forward with them.
[893.02 → 893.42] Yeah.
[893.82 → 895.52] We'll have to see how it goes.
[899.50 → 902.52] We'll have to pay close attention to Aries, I guess, specifically.
[903.12 → 904.76] See what ASUS does with that.
[904.76 → 907.90] Maybe see how ASUS communicates around it.
[908.30 → 908.76] I just...
[910.04 → 911.80] Yeah.
[913.84 → 917.66] This line of communication was very, in my opinion, sassy.
[919.34 → 920.12] Seriously, though.
[920.28 → 922.88] It was sassy, and it was just...
[922.88 → 924.02] It was not what...
[924.02 → 925.40] Are you talking about their blog post?
[925.70 → 925.88] Yeah.
[925.88 → 926.74] The cancellation blog post?
[926.82 → 926.90] Yeah.
[926.90 → 927.40] A little sassy?
[927.60 → 927.78] Yeah.
[927.92 → 932.98] And it's like, yes, the community wanted GBP to be pulled.
[932.98 → 937.16] But I think even more than that, at the core, I think people wanted to know what the heck
[937.16 → 937.88] was going on.
[938.74 → 941.00] And I don't think anyone got that.
[941.32 → 942.42] Because now it's just gone.
[942.56 → 947.04] And we still don't even really know what it actually was.
[947.04 → 948.32] What the actual rules were.
[948.58 → 951.98] We're being told that everything that we knew was rumours, conjecture, mis truths.
[951.98 → 952.54] Mis truths.
[953.16 → 954.92] So, we didn't know anything then?
[955.28 → 956.24] So, what's the truth?
[956.30 → 956.94] We still don't know.
[957.54 → 960.58] They're saying, like, oh, it was just to, like, make things more clear.
[960.68 → 960.92] Okay.
[961.02 → 962.46] But we need more, like...
[962.46 → 963.32] We have a...
[963.32 → 966.44] Someone showing us, like, basically a contract in very clear terms.
[966.50 → 968.80] And then you're being like, everyone's just supposed to be happy.
[969.00 → 969.20] Okay.
[969.36 → 969.84] And...
[969.84 → 970.34] It doesn't work.
[970.58 → 971.50] By the way...
[971.50 → 971.96] Thank you, Ivan.
[971.96 → 975.32] That in no way makes it more clear for everybody.
[975.58 → 978.24] That makes it way, way, way harder to buy a graphics card.
[978.46 → 980.62] If I rock up and there's, like...
[980.62 → 983.30] Okay, there's gaming, there's Horus, there's DOG.
[984.42 → 987.96] There's all that times two for each different one.
[988.02 → 988.84] That's way harder.
[989.62 → 990.34] That's way harder.
[991.38 → 993.82] To figure out the tier of the graphics card, I guess?
[995.16 → 997.74] Because none of those words, like, really mean anything.
[997.86 → 998.02] No.
[998.92 → 999.20] Yeah.
[999.20 → 1002.32] It'd be way better if they...
[1002.32 → 1006.64] I think it'd be a better business case for them just to say, hey, a giant banner that
[1006.64 → 1009.02] says NVIDIA GTX 1070.
[1009.32 → 1009.92] Well, okay.
[1009.98 → 1011.50] Like, that's what people want, right?
[1012.64 → 1012.96] Let's...
[1012.96 → 1017.66] I'm going to get to the page first, but let's go to Amazon.com.
[1018.02 → 1018.36] No.
[1019.04 → 1020.20] Let's go to New egg.
[1020.44 → 1020.78] Ooh.
[1022.24 → 1025.96] I switched because of, like, purchase history and related items and stuff.
[1026.76 → 1027.22] Okay.
[1027.40 → 1028.56] Did you get a vein Vic?
[1028.56 → 1030.02] Don't worry about it, boy.
[1030.56 → 1032.68] Let's go to Luke's screen.
[1032.80 → 1033.34] What is that?
[1033.82 → 1034.24] What is that?
[1034.48 → 1035.16] Now, squeal!
[1037.48 → 1037.96] Okay.
[1038.14 → 1038.74] NVIDIA.
[1039.74 → 1040.30] Search.
[1043.84 → 1045.60] I guess you don't even see boxes.
[1045.60 → 1056.72] Well, I mean, the name already has...
[1056.72 → 1057.78] And, like, everything has GeForce in it.
[1057.78 → 1058.80] The branding is there.
[1058.86 → 1061.90] So that's, like, the text equivalent of the like, put the banner.
[1062.26 → 1062.40] Yeah.
[1062.40 → 1064.00] Because that's right at the beginning of all of them.
[1064.24 → 1068.80] Well, that's another point as to why this GPP didn't even need to exist because it's already...
[1068.80 → 1070.32] It's already in the name.
[1070.86 → 1073.12] I don't buy this whole transparency angle.
[1074.08 → 1074.44] Yeah.
[1074.52 → 1075.18] I don't buy it.
[1075.88 → 1076.98] I wish they would just own it.
[1077.04 → 1078.14] Hey, we tried to make a lot of money.
[1078.38 → 1079.40] We tried to make more money.
[1079.62 → 1080.14] We got caught.
[1080.48 → 1081.04] It wasn't...
[1081.04 → 1083.30] You could even be like, we thought this was a good idea.
[1084.06 → 1085.38] Clearly, everyone didn't.
[1086.62 → 1087.24] We're going to buy.
[1087.60 → 1087.94] Yeah.
[1088.36 → 1089.28] I would buy that more.
[1089.28 → 1089.84] That's the way companies do that.
[1090.30 → 1090.56] Yeah.
[1090.74 → 1094.22] You should have shut down all your stores for an afternoon and had some kind of training for all your employees.
[1096.50 → 1100.06] That's how you signal to the populace that you care.
[1100.46 → 1100.82] Man.
[1101.00 → 1101.28] Okay.
[1101.28 → 1105.48] Anyway, I think we've beat this topic down and left it in a ditch.
[1105.48 → 1110.90] So, we can move on to the T-Mobile slash Sprint merger.
[1111.08 → 1113.94] So, you know more about this than I do, but they've tried to do this before.
[1114.02 → 1115.02] I know nothing of this.
[1115.10 → 1115.72] I know.
[1116.00 → 1116.26] I know.
[1116.34 → 1119.88] Was it the FTC that blocked it in the past?
[1120.24 → 1120.44] Yeah.
[1120.78 → 1123.52] This is all FTC stuff.
[1123.60 → 1127.86] So, I believe the FTC was like, we think there's room for four players, so no.
[1128.60 → 1129.28] Yes, that's correct.
[1129.32 → 1131.42] So, that would have been under the Obama administration.
[1131.42 → 1138.78] And they thought, okay, the market in the U.S. could support four major cellular provider services or companies.
[1139.00 → 1140.64] So, they thought more is better.
[1140.82 → 1141.66] It's more competition.
[1142.46 → 1144.64] So, we're not going to let you guys merge.
[1145.20 → 1146.10] That was then.
[1146.36 → 1147.12] Things have changed.
[1147.28 → 1153.02] Not only is it just a change of administration, and they think that the Trump administration would be more favourable to this merger.
[1153.70 → 1155.74] A lot of it has to do with 5G, actually.
[1156.38 → 1159.58] And the U.S. and the administration is very serious about 5G.
[1159.58 → 1166.54] Yeah, remember that Trump, like, I don't know if you want to say unilaterally, but he did that little signature.
[1166.64 → 1167.86] We should have one more G.
[1167.86 → 1173.50] He did that little signature thingy to say that Broadcom and Qualcomm shouldn't merge, right?
[1173.62 → 1180.06] And the rationale for that was like, Qualcomm is instrumental in advancing 5G.
[1180.06 → 1185.02] And there's a big global race to be the country that pioneers 5G the most right now.
[1185.54 → 1187.28] And China and South Korea are winning.
[1187.72 → 1191.76] And the U.S. wants to win because you get lots of benefits from pioneering the technology and the standards.
[1192.14 → 1194.12] Lots of job creation, IP.
[1194.70 → 1198.80] It was perfect for the U.S. to have developed 4G, and they want to keep that going.
[1198.80 → 1209.82] And I think that with this, the new merge company will have a greater ability to pioneer 5G.
[1211.62 → 1216.28] I think there's an opportunity for T-Mobile and Sprint to make a really cool name when they merge.
[1218.02 → 1222.16] Mobile, Sprint, that's a little motion here, but they're just going to be called T-Mobile still.
[1222.46 → 1222.90] Missed opportunity.
[1222.90 → 1223.54] Oh, okay.
[1223.68 → 1224.36] Missed opportunity.
[1224.36 → 1227.20] So they're merging, but essentially T-Mobile is taking over Sprint.
[1228.12 → 1228.98] Is that kind of the deal?
[1229.14 → 1230.92] Because if they're just being called T-Mobile.
[1231.32 → 1236.66] I don't think the name, like, I don't necessarily think just because the name is still T-Mobile that indicates that they're the big winners.
[1236.90 → 1237.82] But I don't know.
[1237.94 → 1238.14] Maybe.
[1238.50 → 1241.96] I think public eye might come across that way, even if it's not actually that way.
[1242.32 → 1244.18] Because everyone's calling it T-Mobile now.
[1246.48 → 1246.88] Well.
[1248.54 → 1249.88] I don't know enough about it.
[1250.38 → 1251.82] I can't really claim anything either way.
[1251.82 → 1253.54] They've just said that they're committed to merging.
[1253.54 → 1255.46] They plan to merge, but it's not up to them.
[1255.54 → 1256.30] They still have to.
[1256.80 → 1258.62] The courts still need to approve this.
[1258.74 → 1258.90] Yeah.
[1259.08 → 1260.76] And that's going to take a couple of months, I think.
[1263.06 → 1265.62] Even though I'm not from the States, I generally like T-Mobile.
[1266.44 → 1268.60] I've liked how they've done a lot of their campaigns.
[1268.78 → 1271.86] I like the kind of moves that they've done in the market over the last while.
[1272.52 → 1274.14] So, sounds cool to me.
[1274.14 → 1275.30] Here's a theoretical question.
[1276.70 → 1279.18] Every good capitalist likes competition, right?
[1279.52 → 1279.76] Yeah.
[1279.76 → 1284.88] My question is, does more players mean more competition?
[1285.00 → 1285.54] Not necessarily.
[1285.54 → 1287.00] Because right now, you've got four.
[1287.72 → 1289.82] T-Mobile and Sprint are numbers three and four.
[1290.26 → 1290.40] Yeah.
[1290.40 → 1293.02] They're way smaller than AT&T and Verizon.
[1293.82 → 1296.18] Should they merge, they'll be about the same size.
[1296.44 → 1299.34] So, do you think they actually have more of an ability?
[1299.70 → 1303.22] Is there more competition when there's three equally sized players?
[1303.22 → 1305.90] I kind of think probably.
[1305.98 → 1306.24] Maybe?
[1306.40 → 1310.98] Because I think where the market probably needs more competition is with the big guys.
[1311.24 → 1314.60] So, I would rather there be a fight between three big giants.
[1315.22 → 1317.46] And please, no less than three.
[1318.84 → 1325.90] Because we have enough of that problem in our own space with AMD and Intel and AMD and NVIDIA.
[1325.90 → 1333.76] But, so please no less than three, but I like the idea of taking three and four and making them an actual proper competitor.
[1333.86 → 1334.54] Like a real, yeah, exactly.
[1334.72 → 1335.92] Against the other two big guys.
[1336.06 → 1337.54] That seems like a good idea to me.
[1337.76 → 1342.26] And even if you can make a fourth, as long as all four are the same kind of size.
[1342.46 → 1347.70] When you have four, and you have two kind of smaller ones and two kind of bigger ones, there is good competition there.
[1347.70 → 1351.04] Because there is competition for the smaller markets and competition for the bigger markets.
[1351.20 → 1356.46] But I don't feel like T-Mobile and Sprint are going to abandon their places.
[1357.16 → 1357.24] Sure.
[1357.46 → 1358.68] So, I think it will be okay.
[1359.24 → 1360.80] They'll have more funds to move up market though.
[1361.04 → 1361.24] Yeah.
[1361.88 → 1365.92] Speaking of collusion, because three player oligopolies sucks.
[1366.74 → 1367.94] DRAM, price fixing.
[1368.08 → 1368.26] Yeah.
[1368.74 → 1369.28] Good call.
[1369.28 → 1378.56] So, the law firm Higgins Berman has filed a class action lawsuit against Samsung, Micron, and Hyde.
[1378.88 → 1382.68] I love how every law firm is so obviously a law firm just by the name.
[1383.94 → 1386.52] I wish that was one person's full name.
[1387.22 → 1388.22] That would be awesome.
[1388.84 → 1391.78] There's a lot of people with two first names, but not enough with two last names.
[1391.78 → 1404.84] So, according to the firm's investigation, the three DRAM manufacturers conspired to limit the supply of DRAM chips between 2016 and 2017 with the purpose, of course, of inflating their prices.
[1405.36 → 1406.48] And we've all seen that happen.
[1406.56 → 1412.64] DRAM saw a 47% price increase during 2017, the largest jump ever in the last 30 years.
[1412.88 → 1417.66] And probably ever because before 30 years ago, did they even have DRAM?
[1417.66 → 1421.48] They probably had A, B, and C RAM, but like...
[1421.48 → 1422.10] Oh, yeah.
[1422.38 → 1423.52] That's ancient stuff.
[1425.18 → 1437.46] So, the complaint has been put forward on behalf of anyone who, in the U.S., purchased something containing DRAM from one of these three companies from July 1st, 2016 through February 1st, 2018.
[1437.46 → 1449.06] The suit claims that after a global decline in the price of RAM chips, the three companies began in June 2016 to deliberately limit their output of DRAM storage chips.
[1450.20 → 1451.96] But did they have to...
[1451.96 → 1452.32] If they're...
[1452.32 → 1452.50] Okay.
[1452.60 → 1458.76] If they're colluding, and they want the prices to go up instead of down, did they have to do it so hard?
[1459.44 → 1461.36] I mean, like, it's kind of like...
[1461.36 → 1461.54] Yeah.
[1461.54 → 1462.26] They kind of overkill.
[1462.36 → 1463.98] It's pretty suspicious now.
[1464.00 → 1464.42] Like, it's so obvious.
[1464.42 → 1464.98] That's...
[1464.98 → 1465.42] Yeah.
[1465.60 → 1467.96] You think you try to be slightly subtle.
[1468.10 → 1469.56] Let's just get them to climb gradually.
[1470.42 → 1472.02] But depending on the details...
[1472.02 → 1472.18] No, man.
[1472.22 → 1475.02] I want, like, 400 new cars.
[1476.48 → 1477.02] Well, okay.
[1477.16 → 1478.18] That's cranking up a lot.
[1478.56 → 1480.10] They're obviously going to try to get away with it.
[1480.16 → 1484.88] And maybe what it takes to get away with it is to be like, we literally don't have the capacity to make more.
[1484.94 → 1487.96] So, then they had to not build a factory.
[1488.12 → 1489.44] And then they don't have this factory.
[1489.60 → 1490.50] Or they have the...
[1490.50 → 1492.54] A lot of it has to do with their process notes and stuff, too.
[1492.54 → 1492.66] Yeah.
[1493.10 → 1494.66] Because they're not scaling how they should.
[1494.72 → 1497.82] And they're, like, publicly saying to each other that they're not going to go for scale.
[1497.96 → 1500.36] They're going to go for price per item and whatnot.
[1501.44 → 1503.58] Well, I hope they get found guilty.
[1504.78 → 1505.56] That'd be interesting.
[1505.66 → 1506.24] That would be pretty cool.
[1506.24 → 1507.52] The world would be more interesting to me.
[1507.76 → 1513.72] That'd be kind of fun if you could charge someone guilty of, like, your jerks at running a company.
[1514.70 → 1515.30] Oh, yeah.
[1515.30 → 1515.36] Yeah.
[1516.00 → 1519.08] Like, you clearly have the money to build another factory.
[1519.20 → 1521.12] There's clearly the market to build another factory.
[1521.30 → 1527.32] You're not doing it just because you want to be whatever and charge an insane amount of money per chip.
[1527.88 → 1529.20] So, you guys suck.
[1529.48 → 1530.06] Here's a fine.
[1530.24 → 1530.40] Yeah.
[1530.44 → 1531.96] This is kind of where capitalism breaks down.
[1532.04 → 1536.74] Where it's like, in theory, if they're doing that, then there should be room for a new entrant in the market.
[1536.86 → 1538.46] But the barriers to entry are so damn high.
[1538.46 → 1539.44] So insanely high.
[1539.44 → 1544.52] The investment is so large and the talent pool is just not big enough that they own it.
[1544.92 → 1545.54] It's an oligopoly.
[1546.40 → 1553.18] I wouldn't be surprised if these guys were caught, like, actually guilty because from 1998 to 2002,
[1553.40 → 1559.20] Hyde, Samsung, and Micron were among a group of vendors who would ultimately end up paying a settlement to end complaints
[1559.20 → 1561.16] that they conspired to rig the price of DRAM chips.
[1561.30 → 1562.82] So, it's not even the first time this happened.
[1564.78 → 1567.58] Also, yeah, thank you, Twitch Chat, for pointing out the resolution problem.
[1567.58 → 1569.58] I don't know what was going on there.
[1569.66 → 1573.88] I had it set to default resolution, and it must have been on, like, 64 by 64.
[1574.06 → 1575.86] Not actually, but it was pretty freaking bad.
[1576.12 → 1577.88] So, I changed it, and we seem to be good now.
[1578.70 → 1580.42] I put it that way, actually, because I have a zit.
[1582.36 → 1582.92] Thanks, Luke.
[1583.48 → 1584.22] Yeah, good on.
[1584.64 → 1586.26] Now, it is there for the world to see.
[1586.32 → 1588.06] No, it was the resolution of this screen.
[1588.30 → 1588.62] Ah.
[1588.76 → 1590.42] So, it didn't even have anything to...
[1590.42 → 1591.50] They could already see my zits.
[1591.56 → 1592.12] Yeah, yeah.
[1592.58 → 1593.08] It's okay.
[1593.08 → 1594.44] There for the world to see.
[1594.44 → 1599.16] Speaking of for the world to see, let's do sponsor spots.
[1599.64 → 1601.36] Sponsors, sponsors, sponsors.
[1601.86 → 1602.40] Get money.
[1602.74 → 1606.04] For the world not to see your private...
[1606.04 → 1606.70] Infer...
[1606.70 → 1607.44] Internet?
[1607.70 → 1611.12] Your private Internet access information.
[1611.48 → 1612.00] Infernetmation.
[1612.18 → 1612.42] Whew!
[1612.74 → 1612.92] Invasion.
[1612.92 → 1616.88] I meant to say your private information, but I tripped, like, 18 times trying to get there.
[1616.88 → 1623.96] But anyway, PIA, if you need a VPN, like my dad did, to access his own website at school.
[1624.12 → 1625.14] That was pretty insane.
[1626.40 → 1627.14] The IT department...
[1627.14 → 1628.30] Uphill both ways.
[1628.42 → 1628.72] Yeah.
[1630.40 → 1630.80] Basically.
[1632.24 → 1632.88] Well, okay.
[1632.96 → 1635.76] He's an instructor.
[1636.30 → 1640.10] And the IT department at school had no idea why he couldn't access the website.
[1640.66 → 1642.76] So, I was like, just, you know, do that thing.
[1642.84 → 1643.28] And it worked.
[1643.54 → 1644.10] What's his website?
[1644.22 → 1645.28] Can we all go to it right now?
[1645.28 → 1647.16] Uh, that'll probably bring it down.
[1647.70 → 1649.32] Um, but...
[1649.32 → 1650.52] Lukesdad.com.
[1650.82 → 1651.70] Yeah, let's not.
[1651.78 → 1653.98] I'm actually not going to tell the domain name, because...
[1653.98 → 1656.42] I actually am going to go to Lukesdad.com just to see.
[1656.44 → 1657.24] Is there a website there?
[1657.26 → 1658.44] It's probably owned, but not...
[1658.44 → 1660.28] You might want a VPN behind...
[1661.36 → 1662.28] Okay, it's not...
[1662.84 → 1663.88] Yes.
[1664.18 → 1665.04] Someone's going to own that now.
[1665.04 → 1667.22] It's parked for free, courtesy of GoDaddy.
[1667.38 → 1669.80] It's going to take almost no time until that's gone.
[1669.90 → 1672.10] Yeah, your dad's watching this, and he's probably buying it up right now.
[1672.10 → 1678.30] Anyway, you can connect up to five devices onto your PIA account at a time.
[1678.80 → 1683.42] Uh, they have apps for Android and iOS if you need it.
[1683.78 → 1686.60] Uh, there are apps for Windows, macOS.
[1686.98 → 1689.50] Literally, the notes on here say Linus.
[1689.98 → 1692.78] But I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be Linux, but that's wonderful.
[1692.78 → 1697.40] Um, and Google Chrome, so you can have a plugin specifically for it, so you don't have to have
[1697.40 → 1698.84] the app installed on the computer if you want.
[1698.90 → 1700.10] It's kind of easy to do it that way.
[1700.64 → 1706.24] Um, it has an internet kill switch that will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected
[1706.24 → 1706.90] unexpectedly.
[1707.24 → 1708.40] That's quite cool.
[1708.74 → 1710.12] Not all VPNs have that.
[1710.42 → 1714.18] So if your VPN disconnects for whatever reason, it then starts flowing everything through.
[1714.18 → 1715.04] Yeah, yeah.
[1715.22 → 1717.94] Not VPN, and that's not super great.
[1718.02 → 1718.92] That's such a fail.
[1719.40 → 1722.96] Uh, check it out today at the link that's like below here.
[1723.62 → 1725.64] If you're on Twitch, I guess just type that out.
[1725.74 → 1726.60] It's not that complicated.
[1726.96 → 1731.38] Or if you are on YouTube or SoundCloud, I guess.
[1731.68 → 1732.50] Does anyone listen?
[1732.60 → 1733.24] Some people do.
[1733.54 → 1738.82] Uh, in the description of this thing, whether it's an audio thing or a video thing, we'll
[1738.82 → 1739.62] have a link to PIA.
[1739.82 → 1740.28] Check it out.
[1740.34 → 1740.76] It's awesome.
[1740.84 → 1741.18] It's great.
[1741.26 → 1742.00] It does good things.
[1742.00 → 1745.08] And speaking of things that are awesome, great, and do good things, FreshBooks.
[1745.30 → 1746.10] FreshBooks.
[1746.48 → 1751.44] If you're trying to run a company, and you need to invoice people for whatever reason, you
[1751.44 → 1752.02] can do that.
[1752.34 → 1753.06] Super fast.
[1753.36 → 1753.96] Super simple.
[1754.20 → 1754.84] No big deal.
[1754.94 → 1756.64] Invoices to your customer.
[1756.96 → 1761.50] You can check to see if they have seen that said invoice so you can bug them about it.
[1762.28 → 1763.00] Get that green.
[1763.34 → 1764.50] You can collect your money.
[1764.80 → 1768.54] You can also do expenses through the app, which is super cool.
[1768.88 → 1771.38] It keeps track of who owes you what.
[1771.38 → 1775.54] It keeps track of how much you've spent on different things, which is really cool.
[1775.64 → 1777.82] We used it in a scrapyard horse, and it was actually quite helpful.
[1778.14 → 1781.96] If you have any questions, you can reach out to an actual person.
[1782.10 → 1783.16] There are no escalations.
[1783.52 → 1784.70] There's no return calls.
[1784.80 → 1786.76] They just pick up and solve your problem.
[1786.92 → 1787.90] There isn't even a phone tree.
[1788.06 → 1789.14] You're just like, hey, what's up?
[1789.20 → 1789.92] I need help.
[1789.96 → 1790.92] And they're like, yeah, I got you.
[1790.96 → 1791.42] No problem.
[1791.68 → 1792.34] It's pretty simple.
[1792.96 → 1794.62] I'm sure that's exactly how they do it.
[1794.94 → 1795.48] FreshBooks.
[1795.48 → 1798.56] And next up, we have Squarespace.
[1799.78 → 1803.80] Squarespace is a website that you use to make other websites.
[1804.30 → 1805.66] It's like website-caption.
[1805.90 → 1806.42] It's wonderful.
[1807.20 → 1807.94] It's a replicator.
[1808.64 → 1809.80] It's $12 a month.
[1809.92 → 1814.70] If you subscribe for a year, you get a domain with it because that kind of makes sense.
[1814.70 → 1817.92] So you can go to one place, get a domain and a website.
[1818.14 → 1822.76] You can build your website really easily even if you have no idea what building a website even means.
[1822.92 → 1823.60] You can do it.
[1823.62 → 1824.18] No problem.
[1824.28 → 1827.02] On Squarespace because they give you this beautiful template.
[1827.16 → 1830.04] You just put in words and pictures, and it's like, oh, there's a website.
[1830.04 → 1832.64] If you think building's hard, you're not going to sweat.
[1832.70 → 1833.60] There's no manual labour.
[1833.78 → 1834.00] Yeah.
[1834.52 → 1834.84] No problem.
[1834.84 → 1836.88] Well, I mean, it's manual in the sense that you need to use your hands to type.
[1836.88 → 1838.16] You do need to type and click.
[1839.72 → 1841.48] That might be semi-problematic.
[1841.58 → 1843.14] You could use a voice to text.
[1843.14 → 1843.36] Yeah.
[1843.36 → 1847.92] And you might be able to do a clicking thing some other way.
[1849.30 → 1850.74] Like echo locate your computer.
[1851.84 → 1852.32] Squarespace.
[1852.54 → 1853.42] Now it's the next echolocation.
[1853.60 → 1855.64] There is mouse control with your mouth.
[1856.10 → 1856.54] Whoa.
[1856.92 → 1857.18] Yeah.
[1858.02 → 1860.26] For if you're like partially disabled in some way.
[1860.30 → 1861.42] You can scroll with your tongue.
[1862.22 → 1863.22] I'm not sure how it works.
[1863.22 → 1863.86] You can middle quick.
[1864.00 → 1866.74] There was a kid in my school, and he showed me how his worked.
[1867.00 → 1868.28] And it was actually really cool.
[1869.80 → 1871.74] But that was a long time ago.
[1871.74 → 1873.38] And I'm sure it's advanced since then.
[1873.62 → 1874.26] So, yeah.
[1874.76 → 1876.88] Anyway, you can use offer code L...
[1876.88 → 1883.98] Go to squarespace.com forward slash LTT and use offer code LTT to get 10% off your first purchase.
[1884.20 → 1886.10] So, you can have a website and domain and all that fun stuff.
[1886.50 → 1893.18] What if someone followed your advice right then, went to Squarespace, and the free domain they got was luksdad.com.
[1893.18 → 1895.92] And then they made all of this tonight.
[1896.42 → 1896.94] Do it.
[1897.20 → 1897.68] You could.
[1897.84 → 1898.66] That's kind of the cool thing.
[1898.70 → 1901.10] It's so fast you could actually have it done for tonight.
[1901.22 → 1901.66] Oh, easily.
[1901.82 → 1902.46] It's pretty NATO.
[1903.38 → 1905.26] And then I don't have a lower banner for this.
[1905.38 → 1912.68] But also, check out LTX 2018 at ltxexpo.com.
[1912.68 → 1916.06] And I realized that the X in LTX stands for Expo.
[1916.28 → 1918.32] And then we also say Expo.
[1919.46 → 1922.08] So, just don't worry about that too much.
[1922.36 → 1923.34] LTxexpo.com.
[1923.42 → 1923.90] Check it out.
[1924.04 → 1925.36] No, it means exploration.
[1925.62 → 1926.22] Like SpaceX.
[1926.86 → 1927.14] Oh.
[1927.94 → 1930.68] Linus Tech Exploration Expo.
[1930.68 → 1930.96] Explorers.
[1931.00 → 1931.86] Come and explore us.
[1931.88 → 1932.98] It's going to be lit this year.
[1933.66 → 1935.30] I got some things up my sleeve.
[1935.74 → 1936.30] Oh, my.
[1936.72 → 1938.28] I'm just going to be there, I guess.
[1938.40 → 1939.60] It's going to be bonanza.
[1939.88 → 1941.02] Not too crazy.
[1942.02 → 1944.66] Also, check out Float plane.
[1944.90 → 1946.52] That's like what I do and stuff.
[1946.64 → 1947.56] It's pretty cool.
[1947.76 → 1948.32] I like it.
[1948.64 → 1950.12] It's like NATO and stuff.
[1950.12 → 1950.40] Float plane.
[1950.92 → 1953.66] I'm going to get us logged in so we can see what's going on.
[1958.12 → 1958.82] Hold on.
[1959.90 → 1960.68] There we go.
[1960.78 → 1962.16] We have like creators.
[1962.28 → 1962.84] Oh, wrong one.
[1963.12 → 1964.76] We have creators on the platform and stuff.
[1964.84 → 1969.84] So, you can check out Linus Tech Tips, who's apparently uploaded a bunch of videos,
[1969.84 → 1971.74] including keyboard history.
[1972.40 → 1973.38] Good job, by the way.
[1973.46 → 1974.20] Who did that one?
[1974.74 → 1975.58] Who did that one?
[1975.84 → 1977.06] I didn't call my video that.
[1977.10 → 1977.50] What is that?
[1977.96 → 1978.54] Well, that, okay.
[1978.72 → 1980.30] History of the computer keyboard.
[1980.76 → 1981.70] Is that a tech quickie?
[1983.48 → 1984.52] Who works here?
[1984.52 → 1985.20] What?
[1986.40 → 1988.26] That might be a tech quickie.
[1988.48 → 1988.74] Maybe.
[1989.08 → 1989.48] We'll see.
[1990.30 → 1990.98] Not now, though.
[1991.34 → 1993.04] There's also other stuff from Linus Tech Tips.
[1993.16 → 1995.36] There's stuff from Nitwit Ultra, if you subscribe to him.
[1995.62 → 1998.54] There's stuff from Tech Deals, if you subscribe to them.
[1999.06 → 1999.50] It's cool.
[1999.74 → 2003.36] It's a platform that has different people that you can subscribe to, see their videos.
[2004.12 → 2005.16] It's a tech quickie.
[2005.48 → 2006.00] Ah, nice.
[2006.08 → 2007.06] We have a confirmation.
[2007.06 → 2007.68] Thank you, Dennis.
[2007.68 → 2013.98] And you can watch their videos in glorious, really high bit rate and really nice sound quality
[2013.98 → 2018.20] and a private, nice little comment section so you don't have to deal with the drivel that's on YouTube.
[2018.20 → 2019.76] Yeah, and it has a thumbs down button.
[2019.92 → 2020.40] It does.
[2021.14 → 2021.90] So you can be like,
[2021.94 → 2022.56] In the comments section.
[2022.56 → 2023.10] You're dumb.
[2023.68 → 2025.42] Find other humans.
[2025.92 → 2026.68] Get used to it.
[2026.70 → 2028.20] It's the real world, virtually.
[2029.08 → 2030.56] Don't say this out loud, but look at that.
[2030.56 → 2031.58] I'm going to buy that.
[2031.58 → 2033.80] I love that.
[2034.42 → 2035.96] I'm going to make it into something cool.
[2036.26 → 2039.82] You know one of my favourite domains that we have that we have to do something with,
[2039.86 → 2040.58] but we don't know what yet?
[2041.02 → 2042.90] It's adequatevideoservice.com.
[2045.74 → 2049.38] We've been thinking about using it for like our back end or something, but yeah.
[2049.76 → 2052.30] It's just a funny little joke.
[2052.48 → 2053.42] Don't worry about it too much.
[2053.94 → 2055.22] You could use that for April Fool's, maybe.
[2055.90 → 2056.66] That would be funny.
[2057.06 → 2058.28] Like redirecting the whole thing.
[2059.08 → 2060.04] Warranty void stickers.
[2060.62 → 2061.40] We have an update.
[2061.82 → 2062.42] That's exciting.
[2062.82 → 2064.78] I've been excited by this for a little while.
[2065.16 → 2065.90] I'm going to first post this to the show.
[2065.90 → 2068.58] I think I was on here last time we talked about it, like two or three weeks ago.
[2068.88 → 2069.60] That sounds about right.
[2069.60 → 2070.42] We talked about it together.
[2070.76 → 2072.64] And at the time, we did.
[2072.64 → 2073.00] One quick thing.
[2073.08 → 2074.72] Someone asked, is there a full plane free trial?
[2074.82 → 2075.38] There will be.
[2075.46 → 2076.04] There isn't yet.
[2077.36 → 2080.44] We're currently in like still like an alpha-y kind of stage.
[2080.60 → 2082.76] So once we properly release, there will be.
[2082.76 → 2085.76] The day there's a free trial is the day I use it for the first time.
[2086.40 → 2087.30] That's not true.
[2087.50 → 2088.02] I'm just, yeah.
[2088.88 → 2089.98] I was on there today, actually.
[2090.00 → 2090.96] I was like, you have to.
[2091.58 → 2092.88] I have no choice.
[2093.02 → 2093.22] Rip.
[2093.22 → 2096.24] So, okay.
[2096.66 → 2102.74] Per U.S. law, no warranty or product sold for over five bucks can put any restrictions on repairs.
[2102.82 → 2103.62] Who does the repairing?
[2103.74 → 2110.34] You can't have a sticker on your product that says, if you break this sticker or your void, your void is warred.
[2110.34 → 2112.00] I'm like, that happened last time.
[2112.78 → 2113.22] Yeah.
[2113.78 → 2114.02] I did.
[2115.52 → 2117.68] One of us said your void is warred last time.
[2117.82 → 2118.86] Anyway, it's still true today.
[2118.90 → 2124.40] Your void will be warred if you use a third-party repair service.
[2124.78 → 2125.76] At least that's what they say.
[2125.76 → 2127.30] But that's actually illegal in the U.S.
[2127.30 → 2132.16] And what we learned last time when the news broke is that, is it the FTC?
[2132.70 → 2134.18] They issued, yes, it is.
[2134.28 → 2137.36] They issued letters to six big companies.
[2137.50 → 2142.12] We didn't know who the companies were, but they were like, look, guys, you know this has been illegal since the 70s.
[2142.22 → 2144.98] We're about to crack the whip, crack down on it.
[2145.26 → 2145.56] Yeah.
[2145.56 → 2146.52] And guess what?
[2146.58 → 2147.92] Now we know who those companies were.
[2148.58 → 2149.62] Hit me with them, Luke.
[2149.84 → 2151.62] Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo.
[2152.82 → 2153.38] Wow.
[2154.84 → 2155.56] What competition.
[2156.36 → 2157.58] It's like all the console people.
[2157.94 → 2158.46] It's interesting.
[2159.30 → 2162.02] Also, I don't understand the $5 thing.
[2163.50 → 2167.70] Why are you allowed to put restrictions on repairs for things under $5?
[2168.82 → 2169.88] That's so weird.
[2169.88 → 2173.84] I think it's probably a bundle.
[2173.84 → 2179.50] Like this one sentence that we're, or clause that we're focused on in the context of this article is part of a larger bundle.
[2179.76 → 2183.94] And to attribute that whole bundle to items that are cheaper than $5 would just be too much work.
[2183.98 → 2186.98] And it would probably like to inhibit people from starting cheap little businesses.
[2187.28 → 2187.60] Okay.
[2187.86 → 2188.16] Sure.
[2188.30 → 2189.04] That's my speculation.
[2189.58 → 2190.10] Why not?
[2190.14 → 2195.16] It's just such a weird, like, what's even under $5 that you would take to a repair shop?
[2195.42 → 2195.94] Fidget spinner.
[2196.12 → 2197.04] Grease that puppy up.
[2197.28 → 2198.80] It just doesn't spin anymore.
[2199.70 → 2203.02] A quarter turns all I get.
[2203.02 → 2205.90] I just need some WD-40, but I don't want to spray it on myself.
[2206.46 → 2207.52] Don't worry about it.
[2208.06 → 2208.24] Yeah.
[2208.24 → 2209.04] Hanging on a little hook.
[2210.30 → 2210.66] Anyway.
[2212.22 → 2213.44] I got very specific.
[2213.44 → 2215.00] That's about it for that story, honestly.
[2215.32 → 2217.16] The companies have 30 days to revise.
[2217.50 → 2222.86] There's been, online, you can see kind of a more generic version of the letter.
[2222.86 → 2229.22] But each company did receive a customized tailored letter specifically outlining the offending product.
[2229.36 → 2235.84] So, in the case of Microsoft, it was the Xbox consoles that had these stickers on them.
[2235.96 → 2237.66] And it's not just about repairs.
[2237.76 → 2242.68] It also says something about third-party accessories as well.
[2242.68 → 2243.54] Oh, interesting.
[2243.76 → 2244.14] Yes.
[2244.68 → 2247.64] It's, it's, Microsoft's actually in a pretty good spot for that.
[2247.70 → 2255.06] Because while their Surface notebooks have, like, notoriously been terrifying to try to work on.
[2255.26 → 2258.34] Because, like, the terracotta and, like, all this other kind of stuff.
[2258.82 → 2260.92] The Xbox One X.
[2261.36 → 2264.18] You're talking about, you're talking, when you said terracotta, you're talking about that, like, uh.
[2264.18 → 2264.42] Yeah.
[2264.54 → 2264.88] I'm sorry.
[2264.96 → 2265.72] Is it called something else?
[2265.72 → 2268.82] Terracotta is like a clay that's on, like, a tag and rules.
[2269.02 → 2269.92] No, what is that called?
[2270.46 → 2271.16] I don't know.
[2271.26 → 2272.30] I think it's Terra something.
[2272.42 → 2273.16] It has a weird name.
[2273.62 → 2274.00] What is it?
[2274.28 → 2274.60] Alcántara?
[2274.76 → 2275.40] Alcántara.
[2275.60 → 2276.20] There we go.
[2276.42 → 2276.82] Alcántara.
[2276.84 → 2277.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2277.42 → 2277.90] Thank you.
[2278.00 → 2279.90] Now the people in their cars are screaming.
[2280.58 → 2281.34] We can stop.
[2281.46 → 2283.24] Have you ever been listening to a podcast while you're driving?
[2283.32 → 2285.14] You're just like, it's on the car!
[2285.86 → 2286.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2286.70 → 2286.84] Whoa.
[2286.90 → 2290.02] So, is that, is that, is that what the like, the soldiers are made out of?
[2290.20 → 2293.26] The like, huge amount of, uh, terracotta army.
[2293.48 → 2293.64] Yeah.
[2293.98 → 2294.22] Ah.
[2294.64 → 2294.86] Yeah.
[2295.00 → 2295.12] Yeah.
[2295.12 → 2295.24] Yeah.
[2295.24 → 2297.62] So, that's where I played too much Civ, apparently.
[2297.90 → 2300.98] Um, anyway, where am I going with this?
[2301.04 → 2306.12] The Xbox One X is actually kind of wonderfully easy to, uh, take apart and put back together.
[2307.58 → 2307.90] Terracotta.
[2308.20 → 2308.36] Yeah.
[2308.66 → 2309.02] There it is.
[2309.08 → 2310.16] It's a type of earthenware.
[2310.56 → 2310.80] Hmm.
[2312.40 → 2313.12] You got your software.
[2313.12 → 2314.18] Learn new things every day.
[2314.18 → 2316.28] You got your software, your bloatware, your wetware, your earthenware.
[2316.62 → 2316.86] Yeah.
[2317.76 → 2319.00] Uh, your who knows where.
[2319.62 → 2320.16] All right.
[2320.70 → 2321.72] That's where this show is going.
[2322.16 → 2323.94] So, yeah, this, this is good.
[2324.02 → 2325.10] I'm very happy about this.
[2325.10 → 2326.92] We'll have to see what actually comes of it.
[2327.28 → 2332.52] Hopefully, it means that my Switch is still good to go, even though I have turned it into
[2332.52 → 2334.48] a purple thing instead of a black thing.
[2334.84 → 2335.96] So, that's cool.
[2336.44 → 2337.84] Um, moving on.
[2337.84 → 2338.50] Is this your thing?
[2339.42 → 2339.80] What thing?
[2339.90 → 2340.62] This topic.
[2340.80 → 2341.04] No.
[2341.42 → 2341.68] Oh.
[2342.22 → 2342.52] Oh.
[2342.98 → 2343.76] Someone responded.
[2343.90 → 2344.92] Sort of, actually.
[2345.42 → 2348.34] Microsoft was an expert witness.
[2348.58 → 2349.44] No, don't read that part.
[2349.60 → 2349.80] What?
[2349.90 → 2353.40] It was like, click on the click on the forum link that came to us from Gemini.
[2353.40 → 2353.76] Path.
[2353.96 → 2354.16] Oh.
[2354.26 → 2354.58] One.
[2355.42 → 2356.02] This is exciting.
[2356.02 → 2357.88] Oh, man.
[2358.04 → 2360.62] This is, uh, this is long.
[2360.90 → 2363.62] Uh, and I can't share it on my screen because I'm logged into the thing.
[2364.54 → 2365.74] Well, let's just give it.
[2365.76 → 2366.60] Are you a fan of this guy?
[2368.32 → 2369.54] Are you a fan of this person?
[2369.54 → 2369.82] Particularly.
[2370.40 → 2371.28] Do you want to talk about that?
[2371.40 → 2372.00] We can.
[2372.42 → 2372.90] I'm not.
[2373.52 → 2374.30] I've read it, but.
[2376.38 → 2378.24] I don't, I don't really know the guy.
[2379.38 → 2380.04] Okay, how about this?
[2380.34 → 2380.66] You know what?
[2380.66 → 2381.12] We're going to go.
[2381.22 → 2382.24] Let's cruise right into Facebook.
[2382.24 → 2382.46] Sure.
[2382.64 → 2382.74] Yeah.
[2382.74 → 2384.28] There's two Facebook-is things today.
[2385.02 → 2387.16] Uh, number one.
[2387.62 → 2393.42] At F8, which is their developer conference, which is happening right around now, they announced
[2393.42 → 2396.28] that they plan to create a clear history tool.
[2396.28 → 2403.10] So, this feature will enable you to see the websites and apps that send Facebook information
[2403.10 → 2404.06] when you use them.
[2404.56 → 2408.62] It'll enable you to delete this information from your account and turn off Facebook's ability
[2408.62 → 2412.70] to store that information associated with your account going forward.
[2413.60 → 2417.60] They will still provide apps and websites with aggregated analytics.
[2417.94 → 2419.04] That's anonymized.
[2419.72 → 2420.36] Anonymized.
[2421.02 → 2421.54] Aluminum.
[2421.54 → 2421.72] Aluminum.
[2422.02 → 2424.80] And this tool won't be launching for a few months.
[2424.80 → 2426.32] They got to build it and test it.
[2426.38 → 2431.02] And apparently, they're sitting down having town hall meetings with security experts around
[2431.02 → 2432.58] the US and all that kind of stuff.
[2432.70 → 2432.88] Okay.
[2432.88 → 2434.94] Do you think this would be a cool tool that you would use?
[2435.04 → 2435.90] Do you even use Facebook?
[2436.96 → 2438.72] Uh, I have one.
[2438.88 → 2440.22] The only things I use on it.
[2440.22 → 2441.12] Oh, you're going to say once.
[2441.70 → 2442.74] I have once.
[2442.84 → 2444.98] I've fully deleted my account like four times.
[2445.04 → 2445.80] Oh, you're one of those people.
[2445.80 → 2447.30] I also didn't create my original account.
[2447.30 → 2450.36] Did you make a Facebook status before each deletion?
[2450.46 → 2450.52] No.
[2450.52 → 2452.84] Be like, hey guys, I'm getting off Facebook.
[2453.14 → 2453.30] No.
[2453.88 → 2457.36] I just disappeared into the ether without telling anybody every single time.
[2457.50 → 2459.56] Uh, I didn't even create my original Facebook account.
[2460.16 → 2461.96] Uh, one of my friends, apparently, I guess.
[2462.20 → 2463.60] Thank you, Jesse, by the way.
[2463.76 → 2464.30] The real name.
[2464.70 → 2469.80] Um, uh, created a Facebook account under my name and then gave me the login and was like,
[2469.80 → 2470.82] start using this.
[2470.82 → 2472.02] And I was like, okay.
[2472.46 → 2473.76] Hook everything up to it.
[2473.84 → 2474.12] Yeah.
[2474.26 → 2474.42] Yeah.
[2474.42 → 2475.26] Your data's gone.
[2475.44 → 2475.80] Goodbye.
[2475.80 → 2476.96] Uh, yeah.
[2477.08 → 2478.90] So, I've never been a huge fan of it.
[2479.32 → 2483.74] Uh, now I use it for the messenger portion because basically everyone's on there.
[2483.80 → 2485.38] So, if you need to contact someone, it's usually.
[2485.56 → 2487.30] What an Android thing to do.
[2487.68 → 2487.86] Yeah.
[2488.00 → 2488.18] Yeah.
[2488.18 → 2488.54] Basically.
[2488.64 → 2488.86] Yeah.
[2488.90 → 2489.54] I do the same thing.
[2489.54 → 2491.88] Um, and then I use groups a little bit.
[2492.02 → 2494.64] I've got two groups on there that I'm fairly active in.
[2494.90 → 2495.14] Hmm.
[2495.52 → 2500.80] One for sharing music and one for talking about nerdy things with my high school.
[2500.82 → 2501.12] Friends.
[2501.18 → 2501.84] You care about music?
[2502.32 → 2502.52] Yeah.
[2502.84 → 2503.04] Huh.
[2505.06 → 2506.02] Talk about this later.
[2506.18 → 2506.42] Okay.
[2506.64 → 2506.84] Yeah.
[2506.98 → 2507.34] Sounds good.
[2507.36 → 2508.64] I can just invite you to the group.
[2508.84 → 2509.24] Yeah.
[2510.28 → 2511.50] Oh, we're all plebs.
[2511.62 → 2512.52] He's above us.
[2512.60 → 2512.94] He can't.
[2512.94 → 2513.10] Yeah.
[2513.14 → 2513.54] He can't.
[2513.54 → 2514.92] He can't join the music sharing group.
[2515.30 → 2516.00] Uh, so yeah.
[2516.00 → 2516.36] I don't know.
[2516.36 → 2517.02] That's cool.
[2517.12 → 2521.94] There's been other stuff that's come out of, uh, W8, F8.
[2522.10 → 2523.42] F8 makes way more sense.
[2524.32 → 2524.68] Fate.
[2526.04 → 2526.48] Wow.
[2526.96 → 2528.04] That's fantastic.
[2528.04 → 2530.78] Uh, but apparently they're going to do a dating app.
[2530.84 → 2532.98] I don't know if, I don't think we talked about that last week.
[2533.02 → 2533.72] Oh, I haven't heard that.
[2534.08 → 2534.68] Facebook dating app.
[2534.76 → 2534.94] Yeah.
[2535.04 → 2537.12] Let me, let me just Google this live on the show.
[2537.32 → 2537.86] Uh, hmm.
[2538.32 → 2539.32] Dating app.
[2540.30 → 2540.70] Interesting.
[2541.50 → 2542.36] First met?
[2542.48 → 2542.86] No.
[2544.12 → 2546.12] Facebook dating looks a lot like Hinge.
[2546.28 → 2548.76] Facebook is taking on Tinder with new dating features.
[2548.76 → 2553.40] I wonder if they will cut off Tinder from their blogging with Facebook.
[2553.60 → 2555.38] I kind of doubt it.
[2555.44 → 2555.90] They couldn't.
[2555.90 → 2556.18] Yeah.
[2556.42 → 2558.32] Facebook is an integral part of Tinder.
[2558.96 → 2559.18] Yeah.
[2559.98 → 2560.38] So yeah.
[2560.48 → 2561.26] New dating app.
[2561.40 → 2566.82] Amid all the crazy privacy stuff, they are directly planning on making a dating app.
[2566.88 → 2571.86] And it's interesting because they're, they've straight up called out that it will not be designed
[2571.86 → 2572.98] around hookups at all.
[2573.86 → 2575.28] Uh, that's not for you to decide.
[2575.28 → 2578.36] Yeah, I know, but they're, they're pushing it to not be that way.
[2578.46 → 2581.38] It will not ever connect you with a friend.
[2582.60 → 2583.56] A Facebook friend?
[2583.64 → 2583.90] Yes.
[2584.84 → 2585.20] Okay.
[2585.32 → 2587.82] So part of the idea is that it pushes you to new people.
[2587.98 → 2588.38] That's cool.
[2588.48 → 2592.20] And it will like keep even the idea that you're on it away from your friends.
[2592.90 → 2593.38] Oh, interesting.
[2593.54 → 2596.52] So it's supposed to be private away from your friends that you're on this thing.
[2596.64 → 2598.62] Give us your data, and we'll give you a date.
[2598.94 → 2599.24] Yeah.
[2599.60 → 2599.82] Yeah.
[2600.04 → 2602.20] And a big part of it is this section.
[2602.28 → 2603.52] They're talking about conversation starters.
[2603.52 → 2608.40] So they'll, they'll try to have like events that are happening around you, and they'll
[2608.40 → 2612.14] try to use groups and things that you're both interested in to try to come up with something
[2612.14 → 2613.24] for you guys to do.
[2614.02 → 2615.68] That is hopefully interesting.
[2616.22 → 2616.86] Yeah, that's cool.
[2618.10 → 2624.54] One problem with the way particularly Tinder works is like, you know, the first stage of
[2624.54 → 2626.34] Tinder is like, Hey, you think I'm hot?
[2626.48 → 2627.28] I think you're hot.
[2627.32 → 2628.04] So we got that.
[2628.04 → 2630.46] So like, boom, that mystery solved.
[2630.52 → 2632.96] But then now you're just in an empty chat.
[2633.08 → 2634.74] You're like, what do we talk about?
[2635.00 → 2635.14] Yeah.
[2635.24 → 2636.40] Where do you start?
[2636.66 → 2639.42] So that actually might, this actually might help with that a lot.
[2639.76 → 2644.54] I haven't been on the dating scene in a long time, but I'm just having something that's like,
[2644.60 → 2648.30] Hey, we're both interested in this thing, but without having to go through the monotony of
[2648.30 → 2650.20] like reading through a basic resume.
[2650.66 → 2650.90] Yeah.
[2650.98 → 2651.70] Giant profile.
[2651.84 → 2651.98] Yeah.
[2651.98 → 2653.14] We need something in the middle here.
[2653.34 → 2653.40] Yeah.
[2653.74 → 2655.26] That's a that's an interesting idea.
[2655.38 → 2659.42] It's just kind of funny that they're bringing this up at the time while they're having all
[2659.42 → 2660.18] these privacy issues.
[2660.18 → 2664.04] But at the same time, despite all the privacy issues, basically no one's leaving Facebook.
[2664.72 → 2666.90] So it's probably fine.
[2666.90 → 2674.42] Related to that, because of the privacy things, Facebook is revisiting the possibility of having
[2674.42 → 2677.88] a subscription model, not it would be an option.
[2678.38 → 2678.82] It's an option.
[2678.94 → 2679.10] Okay.
[2679.36 → 2679.70] Okay.
[2679.84 → 2681.00] Just want to say this loud and clear.
[2681.12 → 2683.72] Facebook's not going to be like, Hey, want to keep your Facebook account?
[2684.36 → 2686.72] Five bucks a month, 50 bucks a month.
[2687.54 → 2688.42] Oh, ad free.
[2688.56 → 2688.78] Okay.
[2688.92 → 2690.50] It would be an ad free subscription model.
[2690.50 → 2694.02] And I think it means you're going to be giving up a lot less data too.
[2694.02 → 2698.20] So they looked into this in the past and then internally, basically everyone was like,
[2698.26 → 2699.30] I don't think that's going to work.
[2699.68 → 2701.22] So they didn't bother doing it.
[2701.30 → 2705.62] But now they think the climate has changed enough that enough people who are, who are
[2705.62 → 2711.70] considering leaving Facebook because of data and ads might say, well, it's worth it to
[2711.70 → 2713.64] me to, to stay.
[2714.34 → 2718.32] If they get rid of ads, and they don't scrape, I could be interested in this.
[2718.84 → 2719.44] See, I don't know.
[2719.44 → 2720.80] I might even use Facebook more.
[2721.70 → 2722.08] Really?
[2722.08 → 2727.28] This is fascinating to me because one of the questions here is like, would, would
[2727.28 → 2729.10] the spur more people to join?
[2729.66 → 2730.30] Hell no.
[2730.44 → 2732.16] In my opinion, no, not a chance.
[2732.38 → 2736.20] I don't think all it would do is retain existing customers.
[2736.32 → 2740.38] I don't think there was going to be anyone who's like, whoa, wit, it's subscription model
[2740.38 → 2740.64] now.
[2740.72 → 2741.06] I'm in.
[2741.18 → 2745.18] I think technically there will technically be some of those people, but I think it will
[2745.18 → 2747.92] be such an insignificant amount that it just won't matter.
[2747.92 → 2753.84] It'll be the same number of people who like want to pay with gold doubloons instead of
[2753.84 → 2754.44] US dollars.
[2756.00 → 2756.36] Yeah.
[2756.42 → 2760.62] Like it's going to be a tiny amount of people, but I think it will definitely
[2760.62 → 2765.42] increase again, a very small percentage of people, but probably a bigger one than what
[2765.42 → 2766.26] we were just talking about.
[2766.54 → 2768.56] People like me to use it a little bit more.
[2768.56 → 2773.22] Um, I don't like ads, but I also don't like running ad blocker because kind of, you know,
[2773.28 → 2778.02] we do a thing on the internet and when you do things on the internet, ad blocker has the
[2778.02 → 2779.42] potential of taking away all of your money.
[2779.48 → 2780.76] It doesn't for us, obviously.
[2781.44 → 2784.92] Um, but I, I do feel like, I don't know.
[2784.98 → 2788.72] I don't want to get into the ad blocker thing because the entire internet just gets super
[2788.72 → 2790.74] pissed if you ever talk about it.
[2790.74 → 2793.48] But anyway, I don't run an ad blocker, so I prefer.
[2793.48 → 2794.28] Yeah, neither do I.
[2794.70 → 2796.54] I prefer to, you can do whatever you want.
[2796.68 → 2797.40] I'm not, I'm not judging.
[2797.40 → 2799.12] You can do whatever you want unless you want to be cool.
[2800.36 → 2803.58] Uh, but, and people are like, oh yeah, no.
[2803.62 → 2804.86] I actually just haven't gotten around to it.
[2804.88 → 2805.36] I'm just lazy.
[2805.52 → 2805.74] I don't know.
[2806.70 → 2811.22] Uh, but yeah, I would rather pay a website and not have to see ads.
[2811.74 → 2813.06] I liked that about Twitch.
[2813.18 → 2814.12] You could get Twitch Turbo.
[2814.86 → 2817.38] Now just everyone's Amazon Prime.
[2817.44 → 2818.30] I would have called it Turbo.
[2819.14 → 2819.46] Turbo.
[2819.46 → 2819.90] Turbo.
[2819.90 → 2822.24] Then you could have a little, like, mascot for it.
[2823.08 → 2824.14] It's Turbo.
[2824.72 → 2826.00] That's actually pretty cute.
[2826.06 → 2826.90] The twerking robot.
[2827.38 → 2827.86] Oh, okay.
[2828.12 → 2829.00] Not cute anymore.
[2829.02 → 2829.62] That's just IBO.
[2830.24 → 2830.60] No!
[2831.08 → 2832.12] Where's Sancho going?
[2832.54 → 2833.46] This is the Nod Show.
[2833.58 → 2834.42] It's a parallel universe.
[2836.12 → 2837.46] Okay, so...
[2838.26 → 2839.10] Two topics left.
[2839.36 → 2840.22] Which one do you like?
[2840.46 → 2841.20] Let's do both.
[2841.92 → 2842.26] We have...
[2842.26 → 2842.82] Why not both?
[2842.90 → 2843.60] ...12 minutes.
[2843.88 → 2844.94] They're both kind of eh.
[2845.98 → 2849.44] Uh, HP printer firmware breaches Australian consumer laws.
[2849.46 → 2851.14] I have no idea what's going on.
[2851.26 → 2851.76] Take it away.
[2853.00 → 2853.84] Uh, this...
[2853.84 → 2855.46] Okay, so...
[2855.46 → 2857.54] I'll join you in a moment.
[2857.60 → 2859.62] I think this began, yeah, in the fall of 2016.
[2859.90 → 2866.30] HP sold a bunch of printers or updated a bunch of existing printers in Australia without
[2866.30 → 2872.92] telling consumers that there's software in these printers or in the firmware that is
[2872.92 → 2876.04] going to limit you from using third-party ink cartridges.
[2877.18 → 2878.70] And that's illegal in Australia.
[2879.78 → 2880.30] So...
[2880.30 → 2880.60] Cool!
[2880.60 → 2881.76] Now they're in trouble.
[2882.16 → 2883.18] And get this.
[2883.60 → 2884.40] Ha ha ha ha.
[2884.80 → 2889.60] HP is offering consumers who are prevented from using a non-HP cartridge compensation of
[2890.20 → 2890.54] $50.
[2891.34 → 2892.30] If you...
[2892.30 → 2895.28] More than 2,000 customers suffered under this...
[2895.28 → 2896.22] Under this software.
[2896.48 → 2898.98] And if they each get their $50, that's going to cost HP...
[2898.98 → 2900.94] Hold on to your tits...
[2900.94 → 2901.76] $100,000!
[2901.76 → 2905.72] HP is like...
[2905.72 → 2906.26] Wait, how much?
[2906.58 → 2907.10] Oh, okay, great.
[2907.28 → 2910.86] It's like that scene in Austin Powers where he's like, a million dollars.
[2910.98 → 2912.82] And they all start laughing at him like, fine.
[2912.82 → 2913.82] Yeah, yeah.
[2913.82 → 2914.84] Here you go.
[2914.88 → 2915.64] I was worth a shot.
[2915.64 → 2916.64] Ha ha ha.
[2918.08 → 2919.18] No problem.
[2919.20 → 2923.40] They probably got way more sales of ink than that $100,000.
[2925.22 → 2927.54] Yeah, that's really not a lot.
[2927.54 → 2933.20] Especially because not all the consumers are going to even claim this.
[2933.74 → 2934.12] No.
[2934.62 → 2937.82] The laziness will prevail in a lot of this kind of situations.
[2937.98 → 2941.04] It's like the idea behind, like, why are there still mail-in rebates?
[2941.12 → 2943.14] Why isn't it just automatically taken off at the till?
[2943.52 → 2943.88] Effort.
[2943.88 → 2945.42] Because you're probably not going to mail it in.
[2945.94 → 2946.40] Heck no.
[2946.52 → 2947.18] Especially now.
[2947.32 → 2950.78] God, even when snail mail was just called mail, I wouldn't do that.
[2950.94 → 2951.84] Yeah, yeah.
[2952.04 → 2953.06] And most people wouldn't.
[2953.06 → 2960.18] So the discount actually becomes, when you do the math on your end, it's not $10 off every single item that you sell.
[2960.36 → 2963.22] It's $10 off, like, actually a pretty small portion.
[2963.46 → 2968.68] But you will probably sell more because you can post the price as being lower.
[2968.78 → 2970.58] Because you're like, it's lowered because of mail-in rebate.
[2970.66 → 2971.30] But then no one does it.
[2971.54 → 2972.98] Anyway, stupid stuff.
[2973.34 → 2973.66] Genius.
[2974.12 → 2974.28] Yeah.
[2974.56 → 2976.42] So it's not even going to be close to $100,000.
[2976.42 → 2979.86] How much is a new, like, proprietary HP ink cartridge?
[2980.58 → 2981.14] I don't know.
[2981.14 → 2981.50] A lot.
[2981.74 → 2981.80] A hundred bucks?
[2981.94 → 2982.22] Let's.
[2982.58 → 2982.98] Woof.
[2983.44 → 2986.18] I think it really depends on...
[2986.18 → 2990.54] I wish I had the model number of the printer here.
[2992.58 → 2993.98] 25, 36.
[2995.34 → 2995.84] That's the thing.
[2995.88 → 2997.46] It really depends on what printer it is.
[2997.52 → 2999.48] Because, like, this HP61 thing.
[3000.68 → 3001.56] And, like, this one.
[3002.16 → 3003.94] But then, like, the Laser Jet one's more.
[3004.04 → 3005.76] But they said ink cartridge, so it's not that.
[3006.04 → 3006.22] Okay.
[3007.50 → 3008.10] I don't know.
[3008.20 → 3009.88] It really depends on what cartridge it is.
[3009.88 → 3012.88] Well, all I was going to say is, even if...
[3012.88 → 3018.32] Like, half the people affected just bought ink, then they've already paid for the whole scandal.
[3018.56 → 3021.36] So in Australia, about $60 a cartridge, apparently.
[3021.48 → 3022.16] $60 Australian.
[3022.80 → 3023.06] Yeah.
[3023.80 → 3025.00] That'll be, like...
[3025.00 → 3028.60] I think it's stronger than Canadian peso, but, like, not as strong as the U.S.
[3029.80 → 3031.70] Someone just gave me the price per pallet.
[3032.36 → 3032.68] That's...
[3032.68 → 3034.20] That's cool, but...
[3034.20 → 3034.44] That's not...
[3034.44 → 3034.98] That's not exactly you.
[3035.06 → 3037.06] Not particularly helpful at the moment.
[3039.20 → 3040.36] One more topic.
[3040.66 → 3040.88] Yeah.
[3041.06 → 3041.34] Okay.
[3041.44 → 3042.20] Let's move on.
[3043.10 → 3043.50] Mining.
[3043.88 → 3044.62] It was hard.
[3045.20 → 3046.84] And now it's going to be harder.
[3047.18 → 3048.56] New Bit main ASIC miners.
[3048.74 → 3050.48] Or easier, depending on how you approach it.
[3051.18 → 3051.60] Yeah.
[3051.88 → 3053.04] Harder for the average throw.
[3053.32 → 3053.54] Yeah.
[3053.54 → 3055.06] Easier to actually get done.
[3055.12 → 3056.22] Harder for your average.
[3056.78 → 3057.66] These are the...
[3057.66 → 3062.02] Bit main ASIC miners are able to mine Squash.
[3063.64 → 3066.38] And it smashes GPU performance.
[3066.82 → 3068.10] We've got crypto mining hardware.
[3068.36 → 3068.96] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3069.08 → 3077.02] For $2,000, it can perform as well as 15 1080 Ti GPUs at a mere 300 watts.
[3078.02 → 3083.86] Squash is the algorithm used by Cash, Zen cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Z, Bitcoin Private, Komodo, Z Classic.
[3084.34 → 3086.72] And I believe potentially even more.
[3087.86 → 3097.08] So what this means is that it's so much more efficient to use this, what they call an ASIC, an application-specific integrated circuit.
[3097.42 → 3098.74] A specialized computer.
[3098.74 → 3111.20] It's so much more efficient to use that than it is to use a regular off-the-shelf GPU that it brings a concern about how decentralized and free the cryptocurrency is now.
[3111.28 → 3118.92] Because in the utopian world that we enthusiasts dream about, anyone can support the network.
[3119.06 → 3123.12] Anyone can be a node in the network because you can just use an off-the-shelf GPU that you probably have in your computer anyway.
[3123.12 → 3132.44] Once there's a specialized machine that's sold by one company, then it's centralized, basically.
[3132.60 → 3132.94] It's not...
[3132.94 → 3134.34] And the thing is with these...
[3134.34 → 3135.32] It's like you've got a Fed then.
[3135.50 → 3137.34] Like Bit main ASIC miners and stuff.
[3137.54 → 3139.44] It's like you're not going to get one.
[3139.44 → 3149.76] They sell out so fast and their supply is not high enough that a huge percentage of it is people reselling it or kind of more like back-end deals.
[3149.92 → 3151.42] But is that temporary?
[3152.74 → 3160.06] By the time it becomes easy enough for you to buy one, they'll be close enough to the next one that you probably shouldn't.
[3160.98 → 3163.32] That's sort of been the pattern for a long time.
[3163.32 → 3168.30] What I mean, for the whole industry, in the future, won't there be competition?
[3168.46 → 3170.82] There could be two or three people producing these things.
[3172.22 → 3172.94] We'll see.
[3173.16 → 3179.32] I think a lot of companies are kind of scared about jumping in because it's such an incredibly volatile market.
[3181.64 → 3182.70] That's why it's far future.
[3183.44 → 3183.74] Yeah.
[3183.84 → 3185.06] Because it has to stabilize first.
[3185.16 → 3185.44] We'll see.
[3185.76 → 3185.94] Yeah.
[3186.38 → 3187.12] It'll be interesting.
[3187.96 → 3191.30] And like Bitcoin is slightly going back up, sort of, maybe?
[3191.68 → 3192.86] So, I don't know.
[3192.86 → 3193.60] Who knows?
[3193.78 → 3194.14] We'll see.
[3195.18 → 3196.24] I'm into the Ether price.
[3197.02 → 3198.32] That's what I look at every day.
[3198.42 → 3198.88] Here we go.
[3200.06 → 3201.94] Damn, it's almost at 800 US again.
[3202.78 → 3203.04] Yes.
[3203.52 → 3205.70] It's almost at half of what it was.
[3205.76 → 3207.66] What does Jake feel about all this?
[3208.58 → 3209.62] There are other companies.
[3210.34 → 3210.62] Yeah.
[3210.68 → 3213.00] And they're just going to change the algorithms anyway, so.
[3213.58 → 3213.82] Yeah.
[3213.90 → 3215.14] That's what happened to them there.
[3215.26 → 3215.94] It's a night basics.
[3216.62 → 3219.16] They changed them, like, before it mattered.
[3219.54 → 3222.10] But, most of the time, Bit main has already been mining on the Internet.
[3222.10 → 3222.96] No one can hear you.
[3223.04 → 3223.74] Three to four months.
[3223.84 → 3224.56] Get in the show.
[3225.14 → 3225.88] Get in the show.
[3225.98 → 3227.42] So, what he's saying is there are other companies.
[3227.60 → 3228.20] And like, yeah, I know.
[3228.54 → 3231.20] We've talked about them on WAN Show before.
[3232.92 → 3240.10] But there's a lot of, like, what he's saying is by the time these things hit market, even Bit main has been mining on them themselves for a long time.
[3240.10 → 3241.38] So, like, I don't know.
[3241.48 → 3245.14] The mining space is so, it's very messy.
[3245.44 → 3249.92] You have to be, like, really into it to probably stay on top of things.
[3249.92 → 3256.04] The thing is, though, like, this algorithm, Squash, was meant to, it was, like, designed to prevent centralization of the mining process.
[3256.04 → 3256.12] Yes.
[3256.74 → 3261.08] And there's been other cryptocurrencies that this happened to.
[3261.22 → 3269.50] And then after these ASICs come out, they just, like, alter the algorithm so that it kind of nullifies the lead that those ASICs give themselves.
[3270.00 → 3270.16] Yeah.
[3270.16 → 3275.84] So, maybe right now people don't know if Squash will do the same thing and then GPUs will still be relevant.
[3276.26 → 3277.96] Or if there's a fork.
[3278.50 → 3281.34] But either way, we won't know until the future.
[3281.54 → 3287.14] And speaking of the future, that's where you'll have to be to see the next WAN Show or to see any more of the WAN Show because we're going to leave.
[3287.74 → 3288.12] Yes.
[3288.62 → 3288.84] Yeah.
[3289.64 → 3290.60] There's a parallel universe.
[3290.60 → 3294.18] There's a many worlds hypothesis here where there's a WAN Show and a NA Show.
[3294.64 → 3294.88] Yeah.
[3296.12 → 3296.56] Whoa.
[3296.56 → 3303.78] So, if you want to see either one of those, come back here in seven days minus one hour, and you'll be good to go.
[3303.86 → 3306.06] Well, probably not even the minus one hour.
[3306.14 → 3307.02] We were on time today.
[3307.48 → 3307.66] Yeah.
[3308.70 → 3310.74] Seven days minus, like, 20 minutes.
[3311.94 → 3313.20] Anyway, guys, goodbye.
[3313.54 → 3314.06] Play the intro.
[3314.36 → 3314.84] Oh, no!
[3316.98 → 3317.64] Okay, we're good.
[3318.38 → 3318.80] Clench.
[3319.16 → 3319.72] Harder!
[3320.30 → 3321.06] Yeah!
[3322.24 → 3322.68] Yeah.
[3322.68 → 3327.16] Okay, which one am I?
[3328.96 → 3329.50] This one.
[3329.72 → 3330.40] I'm the couch.
[3330.94 → 3331.28] Yes!
[3331.50 → 3331.74] Perfect.
[3331.88 → 3335.68] I'm that little companion cube on the couch that Linus just put up his butt.
[3336.06 → 3336.58] Yay!
[3336.74 → 3337.14] Squarespace!
[3340.74 → 3341.34] Fresh box!
[3342.12 → 3342.46] Nope.
[3342.68 → 3343.40] Private access.
[3344.40 → 3345.58] And you want to do it again?
[3345.76 → 3346.84] No, I thought I'd missed it.
[3346.86 → 3347.54] That's why I did it.
[3347.58 → 3347.84] Okay.
[3348.00 → 3348.42] There we go.
[3348.54 → 3349.02] Fresh box!
[3349.38 → 3350.04] Thank you very much.
[3350.36 → 3351.16] We'll see you next time.
[3351.16 → 3351.62] Slash NBA.
[3351.62 → 3352.74] Slash NBA.
[3353.40 → 3354.16] That's what I can do.
