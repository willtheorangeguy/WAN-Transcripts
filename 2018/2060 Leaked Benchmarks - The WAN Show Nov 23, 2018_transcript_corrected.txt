[0.00 → 7.52] we made it 20 minutes late we did it that's the latest we've been in a while uh, but we have a
[7.52 → 13.82] great show this week us proposes new restrictions on AI exports and guess what the Windows 10 1809
[13.82 → 22.76] update bug continues more bugs also RTX 2060 leaked benchmarks yes all that and more on the
[22.76 → 28.26] Swedish show of your life i thought you meant Swedish for a second the Swedish show
[28.26 → 36.36] yeah I don't have that one is a Swedish word means best ah yes
[36.36 → 39.36] these are not
[39.36 → 46.06] got my Friday shirt on
[46.06 → 54.16] oh
[54.16 → 62.26] another one
[62.26 → 64.26] uh
[64.26 → 73.94] what is your oh yeah my Friday shirt because I just happened to wear it last Friday as well
[73.94 → 76.70] okay I put on this morning like I probably won't be on the Wang show
[76.70 → 85.36] whatever that's fantastic uh speaking of fantastic uh our first topic us
[85.36 → 92.92] restricting AI exports jumping right in what the heck here we go I like it was good this is heavy
[92.92 → 99.18] so what's what's going on with this okay well let me tell you the U.S. department of commerce has
[99.18 → 104.46] proposed new restrictions on the export of AI technologies and the definition of AI technologies
[104.46 → 110.10] is pretty broad here uh could include things like neural networks deep learning natural language
[110.10 → 116.86] processing computer vision and expert systems so that can include products like a Siri enabled iPhone
[116.86 → 123.08] or IBM Watson and so if you wanted to sell those things abroad you need a special license
[123.08 → 130.90] okay so yeah I guess it's the subtext of the article that we linked here uh original source being from
[130.90 → 139.06] some place who was that that was yeah don't worry too much about that
[139.06 → 146.44] uh what are you doing over there are you clicking to the forum well no apparently uh there we go
[146.44 → 152.06] this was not set up properly so now we have caps now it's a good yay now everyone can see what
[152.06 → 159.94] the article is talking about china yeah um very unsurprisingly he's talking about china okay we
[159.94 → 164.10] should have all seen that coming critics of this proposal uh think that if the restrictions are
[164.10 → 168.84] mishandled it could cause serious collateral damage for U.S. businesses like apple and google which rely
[168.84 → 175.26] on china for a large share of their profits companies it is feared may prioritize the development of AI
[175.26 → 181.98] technologies to avoid the famously lengthy export control process don't want to go through that yeah it's not
[181.98 → 188.32] going to make AI products that sound a little tenuous to me everyone wants to make AI it's like
[188.32 → 196.94] it is the thing that is generating all the growth especially wow this is hard to okay that this way
[196.94 → 202.24] there we go that's hard to line up properly that's actually just the way you're pointing though
[202.24 → 209.58] wait you know because he's there on my screen right oh I see try to point at him right now that guy
[209.58 → 213.96] well I guess yeah you just saw him well it's easy for me now yeah that makes sense anyway this dude
[213.96 → 221.04] down here that's probably very troubling for him because uh if you've seen the last few GPU launches
[221.04 → 228.10] two last couple's uh GPU launches there's been a lot of talk about AI AI machine learning all that
[228.10 → 232.20] kind of stuff this is going to affect people like chipmakers this is going to affect software people
[232.20 → 236.68] this is going to affect people who are combining the two like IBM with Watson it's the same with Google
[236.68 → 242.56] i o yeah that's why that's why pixel phones exist because Google thinks they have an edge on AI
[242.56 → 247.30] yeah and what are the biggest categories for Amazon and google smart home everything's smart home it's
[247.30 → 254.86] all AI yeah all of it um and especially NVIDIA because there's a really cool nugget here it got 20
[254.86 → 263.04] of its revenue last year from sales in China um because apparently the U.S. still maintains a monopoly
[263.04 → 270.76] on having the best chips and lots of the best chips are made by NVIDIA, and so they don't want to give up
[270.76 → 276.96] like you don't want to lose your china sales and all that money, but that's also the company those
[276.96 → 282.04] companies are making the most proprietary stuff that they want to keep ankle incubated yeah that makes
[282.04 → 285.86] sense I wish we have remote control of that camera right now so we could have just panned down right
[285.86 → 291.96] panned down to him, so everyone could see this guy who's off-screen right now just crawl across in
[291.96 → 297.24] front of the in front of the scene uh that that would have been when I said incubated I meant insulated
[297.24 → 305.50] ah yes okay anyway yeah this is uh this is going to be interesting because a lot of very smart people
[305.50 → 311.54] for a while not just Elon quite a few smart people for a while um have been to be fair on each side of the
[311.54 → 317.72] fence here we need to do something about AI because it's going to be very dangerous um or people
[317.72 → 323.24] saying no we need to be fully unrestricted because this is like the next wave of awesome, and we need
[323.24 → 327.64] it to come as soon as possible there's been definitely people on each side but I think some
[327.64 → 331.38] people are going to be happy about this but I suspect they're not going to think this is the right
[331.38 → 338.42] thing to do that's hard I mean like because people in the Elon category the open AI category are saying
[338.42 → 344.08] that it needs to be regulated, but it needs to be regulated globally yes not like trade
[344.08 → 349.92] restricted which people are going to get past anyway unless it's in terms of like commerce but
[349.92 → 355.64] the technology yeah that will get past trade restriction so it's not going to affect those
[355.64 → 362.64] types of things at all it's just another trade restriction thing yeah well and which is probably
[362.64 → 368.42] just going to create more knock off culture I want yeah this is my next question is do you think china
[368.42 → 373.84] uh cares about these like if this goes through and the U.S. is not going to send so much stuff to China
[373.84 → 380.80] I don't know if they care at this point they've already invested billions into companies like Alibaba
[380.80 → 387.98] and Baidu and Huawei to you know get their own chips produced domestically yeah uh they're that's
[387.98 → 392.28] stuff they're doing anyway and if they can't get it from the U.S. that's just all the more reason to do
[392.28 → 396.28] it, and it's all the more market share for their own domestic customer company or customers yeah
[396.28 → 404.42] companies yeah companies and customers it's interesting um let's take an I've got an I've got an idea
[404.42 → 410.18] uh oh we can oops sorry about that intro there I want to make a straw poll and I want to see
[410.18 → 419.20] whether people think this is a good idea or not trade restricting AI products good or bad
[419.20 → 425.58] good it's a big it's a cost like let's say it's apple, and it just means every time you
[425.58 → 431.04] if you want to sell iPhones in China you have to pay this fee is that on a per-unit basis per phone
[431.04 → 437.48] or is it like a flat rate for the company because that's just incurring another cost yeah but a lot a
[437.48 → 442.38] lot of these things are fairly uh on the edge in terms of cost and what they're trying to do
[442.38 → 447.58] is sell lots of them and what are they what are they even preventing with other products like what
[447.58 → 451.76] are they going to prevent I don't know it's like the phone is already going to be bought there if
[451.76 → 456.18] someone wants to get it they can get it like if it's like a trade secrets thing it's like oh someone
[456.18 → 462.22] flew to us and a bought the iPhone brought it back to China now they're all using it looking at it
[462.22 → 470.04] probing it like what are you preventing I don't know but one thing they may be preventing
[470.04 → 475.78] is um collaboration between researchers the universities could suffer from this they won't
[475.78 → 482.60] be able to have AI research teams so YouTube I'm sorry uh I can only post one at a time so hopefully
[482.60 → 488.12] you guys get that before the chat wave just takes it away but twitch uh you guys should have
[488.12 → 493.50] that link you guys should have quite a bit of that link, and you should be fine to go away please thank
[493.50 → 504.46] you um get rest results let's see here we go bad okay I don't know my boyfriend Jill BFF Jill no it's
[504.46 → 511.80] my boyfriend's friend Jill what is that's old what is that from IDK my BFF Jill that's from a commercial
[511.80 → 517.62] yeah I thought I'd throw in like a ancient meme reference the meme is old, but it checks out
[517.62 → 524.66] yes I love it also the Star Wars reference uh so yeah most people seem to think it's bad
[524.66 → 531.12] uh we've got a very considerable amount of people not really caring at all which is not too surprising
[531.12 → 536.26] well in our cursory overview here that's like a lot of balls in the air to manage
[536.26 → 543.56] the pros and cons it is for sure we're just a tiny unsophisticated wan show we don't know the law
[543.56 → 550.02] stuff especially American law stuff um but yeah it seems like the people who think it's good
[550.02 → 557.18] is a fairly low percentage um people who think it's bad is a huge percentage but another
[557.18 → 561.42] thing that I would consider here coverage on negative things what if we had focused on awesome
[561.42 → 566.08] I was just going to say reflect that one of it is us going like oh this might be bad so a lot of people
[566.08 → 572.34] might just be automatically agreeing with us yeah another one is another one is I think in a lot of
[572.34 → 578.78] cases the automatic reaction to things governments do is negative um and I think the tech community
[578.78 → 584.52] especially is very scared of things that the government might do that touches our stuff but on
[584.52 → 591.14] the flip side of that I think there's a equal lizard brain reactionary thing to China that goes in
[591.14 → 597.38] the opposite direction uh stop doing stuff in China I'm in favour of blocking china right so who knows
[597.38 → 604.56] I don't know it's interesting though but I think yeah like I think there are a lot of polls happening with
[604.56 → 610.60] this poll wow that's hard to maybe differentiate the pronunciations of that maybe this uh proposed
[610.60 → 616.66] legislation or whatever is one of those light touch regulation things where oh Geez it could touch apple
[616.66 → 622.60] and the iPhone, but they won't use it that way and what they'll really do is use it to regulate like
[622.60 → 628.52] weapons and cybersecurity things that are produced domestically in that realm that they don't
[628.52 → 633.60] want going elsewhere yeah, yeah now we lost them
[633.60 → 644.32] all right well let's keep going for Windows 10 yeah the update it's been trying to update since October
[644.32 → 651.16] there's more there's more there's more grief it ain't over Microsoft says it has blocked the
[651.16 → 659.42] October update on some intel pcs due to bad display drivers released by intel they say intel inadvertently
[659.42 → 665.42] released versions of its display driver to OEMS that accidentally turned off no accidentally turned
[665.42 → 672.08] on unsupported features in windows, and we have the specific uh versions of those drivers in the
[672.08 → 679.00] wan doc here that you can all check out yeah the original version of Windows 10 version 1809 released
[679.00 → 686.46] in early October came with an issue uh caused by broken intel audio drivers but Microsoft says this is a
[686.46 → 694.14] different bug caused by another set of drivers oh Geez yeah no eta in the fix
[694.14 → 702.14] Microsoft is working with intel to expire these display drivers weird way of saying it including
[702.14 → 708.54] coordinating with OEMS and will provide an update on the resolution another weird use of term uh in an
[708.54 → 714.38] upcoming update release which was me saying weird things and there was another bug before when it was
[714.38 → 718.92] causing people to lose their data it was all their data this is a great update it's the update from hell
[718.92 → 724.28] they're still really convincing me to move to Windows 10 that's uh so many people working at Microsoft
[724.28 → 732.16] who are just like oh please stop oh can I just have the holidays already and more fun news RTX 2060
[732.16 → 738.08] heck yeah benchmarks now we got actually fun news semi-leaked give me the pc hardware news my dude
[738.08 → 748.74] here we go yeah well Final Fantasy 15 benchmark oh Geez so uh there we go um oh my god the amount of pop-ups
[748.74 → 755.02] if you care about this benchmark oh my god yeah oh man how brutal is that every single time you go to
[755.02 → 761.52] website now you have to be like I agree to cookies I disagree to the notifications it feels like
[761.52 → 767.08] the like early 2000 late 90s like pop-up scene again yeah except you want to do this do you want this
[767.08 → 771.80] information do you want this to happen I just got your website dude this is my first time oh google
[771.80 → 779.96] chrome how here's my wish list if you could just make it, so websites weren't allowed or like I have
[779.96 → 785.16] to seek it or something yeah like why does that have to be a pop-up like I'm I don't want notifications
[785.16 → 792.00] from like recipes.com like there's like two websites on the whole internet I want notifications from i
[792.00 → 796.50] personally don't want notifications from any website I understand why some people do I think it's a cool
[796.50 → 802.06] feature but like I don't have it on for linustectives.com yeah, but you might like you might
[802.06 → 807.72] check my notifications there, and you want something to pop up from like I don't know calendar hangouts
[807.72 → 814.60] or Gmail I can totally understand turning it on Trello for those things on like a work computer yes or
[814.60 → 820.64] if it's like your computer at home, and you have those things off, and you turn on like I don't know
[820.64 → 824.88] social accounts or something if you care about those things personally I get too many freaking
[824.88 → 830.56] notifications already just calm down on the computer space because that's usually my like
[830.56 → 835.26] I'm getting work done thing and I'll still get the notification here, and it makes the whole internet
[835.26 → 840.66] experience so bank yeah like oh things are loading things are popping in wait we're dropping down to
[840.66 → 849.08] three fps because accept the cookies accept the block thing you have to click three buttons to be able to
[849.08 → 853.66] access a freaking website anyway uh we're talking generally not just specifically about tom
[853.66 → 859.40] I wish I could there's a feature in chrome where I could just block all and then chrome just do it
[859.40 → 867.58] automatically what is this video I don't know you have to get that money baby oh it's an ad
[867.58 → 872.68] okay that's okay um anyway the internet
[872.68 → 880.96] so 2060s are coming out actually it hasn't even been announced it hasn't been officially unveiled we
[880.96 → 886.60] got some leaks we don't even know if it's going to be called RTX 2060 or GTX 2060 at this point
[886.60 → 891.16] oh yeah that's going to be interesting
[891.16 → 897.62] hmm, but we do know the score that I got in the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark which was about
[897.62 → 903.80] 30.43 percent faster than what the g GTX 1060 six gigabyte
[903.80 → 912.22] faster than a Rx 590 slower than a Rx Vega um slower than a 1070 which makes sense but not by like
[912.22 → 920.28] a crazy amount um so that'll be interesting um it being slower than a 1070 by a notable but not
[920.28 → 927.96] crazy amount is almost kind of weird 6.18 percent because you often find parity in the off by 10
[927.96 → 933.62] products like you would often find that like a 1070 would be about exactly the same as a 2060
[933.62 → 940.10] well there's only one benchmark that's fair yeah it's its kind of an interesting like yeah the only
[940.10 → 944.82] thing we benchmark was Final Fantasy 15, and it's 14 the thing that has like notable problems with
[944.82 → 950.48] benchmarks I think it has to do with how this benchmark works that benchmark database um is kind
[950.48 → 956.54] of becoming like a little bit of a like a place you go to when you want to see early kind of leaks
[956.54 → 964.10] yeah that's fair man this like am I scrolled in improperly or something there we go, so this is
[964.10 → 974.72] only on the high preset at uh 3840 by 2160 res okay so do you think that between it and the 1070 you
[974.72 → 978.28] think it would be different if it was but like this score doesn't really mean anything to me
[978.28 → 984.52] no well that's why it's all you can only look at a relative yeah okay so like cool we know about
[984.52 → 988.58] where it fits in the stack but I don't know how it actually performs in that game or at that resolution
[988.58 → 994.04] there's no other comparative resolution we didn't really get a lot of information here no yeah I don't
[994.04 → 1000.18] know it's cool that like the fact that they well not the fact the theory the rumour that they have one
[1000.18 → 1004.70] of these cards, and it performed at that level um hopefully means that it's probably coming fairly soon
[1004.70 → 1012.08] yeah, but we don't even we also don't know how uh similar to the consumer card this card is this is
[1012.08 → 1017.44] presumably some engineering sample we don't know if it's been super sick or junk or medium
[1017.44 → 1022.82] there are a lot of questions here I personally am not a huge fan of rumours the only thing I'm hoping
[1022.82 → 1028.00] is uh with numbers being out there hopefully that means 2060 is coming soon because I know a lot of
[1028.00 → 1035.22] people can't afford the big beefy cards um i I bought 60 series cards for a long time
[1035.22 → 1041.76] um they're VR ready baby heck yeah I love seeing like cases and power supplies that are VR ready
[1041.76 → 1047.80] um but yeah like I don't know it's its it's its exciting because it's a slightly more accessible
[1047.80 → 1052.30] but still very gaming focused powerful GPU we should get some merch that says VR ready
[1052.30 → 1055.92] maybe people will buy it more than the RTX on shirt
[1055.92 → 1061.92] did that not do well it's okay it's a little like yeah how do you wear that anywhere
[1061.92 → 1067.16] yeah you know what I mean yeah that's a that's a home shirt yeah, and you can't buy too many homes
[1067.16 → 1072.86] shirts yeah it's like the kind of your wife's like you're not wearing that you're not wearing
[1072.86 → 1081.70] that if you didn't have the arrow I would have liked it a little more yeah anyway um octane being
[1081.70 → 1091.76] marketed as ram that's shame on you weird wait what well I haven't heard of this yeah multiple is
[1091.76 → 1098.14] this like a in marketing screwed up thing no, no oh my goodness talking about
[1098.14 → 1106.82] freaking things everywhere oh god and then there's a giant banner ms are selling laptops outfitted with
[1106.82 → 1112.86] intel octane cash drives, but they're improperly combining that information in ways that makes
[1112.86 → 1118.42] it seems as if the octane cash drive represents some kind of d-ram rather than a conventional cash drive
[1118.42 → 1124.46] so in this article they did two tests they have some screenshots here where they google certain
[1124.46 → 1131.04] keywords, and they see what comes up, and the dell one is more egregious 24 gigabytes of memory
[1131.04 → 1143.36] 8 gigs of ram plus oh what yeah so they're lumping your d-ram memory with your octane cash memory and
[1143.36 → 1149.60] calling it all memory and saying like yeah this has 24 gigabytes of memory in this laptop not even
[1149.60 → 1157.28] 100 if you look this is kind of hard to see let me zoom in yes we have to enhance we have to enhance
[1157.28 → 1166.58] the photo uh where did it go okay it's this one uh so it was 24 gigabytes right having 24 gigabytes of ram
[1166.58 → 1170.46] and we were just talking about 24 gigabytes memory eight of it is ram 16 of is intel octane
[1170.46 → 1177.42] on the actual bit from Google that they got like the embedded card if you look at the bottom it says
[1177.42 → 1182.84] specifically 24 gigabytes of ram it just says ram it says ram it doesn't even say memory at that part
[1182.84 → 1189.22] down here if they wrote it like this every time I'd be like yeah that's really it's reasonable it's
[1189.22 → 1194.02] confusing but at least they break it out up here they specifically say 24 gigs of ram
[1194.02 → 1203.72] ram that's baloney that is very baloney mike dell looking at you yeah deli boy um that's a
[1203.72 → 1206.92] little weird I'm hoping that's just like someone in marketing that doesn't know what they're talking
[1206.92 → 1214.66] about it's like hey is this thing memory uh does it just no it's not a slip up I'm hoping no I'm hoping
[1214.66 → 1227.52] oh Luke no man I mean thanks extreme tech I wasn't I wasn't really sure um oh my screen is up I wasn't
[1227.52 → 1234.76] I wasn't aware um I appreciate it uh they actually dedicate a part of this article of saying why it's
[1234.76 → 1241.64] not an accident like really no because multiple companies are doing it and I mean if I was
[1241.64 → 1248.94] a marketer at one of these companies I'd probably do it too rude I mean they do have a challenge
[1248.94 → 1253.36] like it's hard enough for consumers to understand this is actually why they shouldn't do if it's hard
[1253.36 → 1256.58] enough for consumers to understand the difference between memory and storage this just makes it even
[1256.58 → 1263.58] harder but how would you advertise that it has these extra capabilities because it's opting
[1263.58 → 1270.18] extreme tech I will give you this is a pretty well laid out article I see what they're saying
[1270.18 → 1276.12] now there's an update there is an update down here at the bottom I wish updates went at the top
[1276.12 → 1280.92] that is one criticism I will give you extreme tech at least there's an update an intel spokesperson has
[1280.92 → 1285.62] contacted us to relay the following message intel opt-in memory is a unique technology that
[1285.62 → 1291.62] bridges the gap between memory and storm like ram it's more in the pc memory hierarchy by placing
[1291.62 → 1292.48] commonly used data
[1292.48 → 1300.24] intel opt-in memory cannot replace Durham entirely yeah not even close however these two memory
[1300.24 → 1305.74] technologies complement each other within the pc so basically uh they didn't say anything nice
[1305.74 → 1310.36] statement um so they have a FAQ maybe that's why the update's at the bottom it doesn't matter
[1310.36 → 1317.46] exactly yeah well intel has a FAQ on their website about opt-in, and it used to say uh you should
[1317.46 → 1323.38] actually look at the full quotes that they have on the article here the FAQ one yeah right
[1323.38 → 1332.02] there it used to say opt-in memory modules do not replace dram, and now it says opt-in is similar
[1332.02 → 1339.02] to the function of dynamic random access memory it used to well I mean I think it still does in a
[1339.02 → 1347.14] different part of the fact say that it doesn't replace it but this kind of ambiguity just kind of
[1347.14 → 1354.94] bolsters the advertisers to say whatever and something that sucks here is I always thought
[1354.94 → 1361.56] opt-in was pretty cool, but it was already really hard for people to understand, and now they're like
[1361.56 → 1367.62] muddying the waters more you know I think there's a better way to explain this to consumers I think
[1367.62 → 1373.46] there are many better ways to explain this to consumers give me one we've well it's on the spot it's cash
[1373.46 → 1379.80] right so to make everything faster in a way that sometimes ram can't like in a certain in some
[1379.80 → 1383.98] situations it's better for you than more ram but how are you going to do that for you than faster ram
[1383.98 → 1390.38] in other situations' no but like it is it's an it's a different thing so do you think the search result
[1390.38 → 1397.56] in the Google like shopping card should just say eight gigabytes ram 16 gigabytes opt-in terabyte
[1397.56 → 1403.24] storage, and then it's up to users to be like to learn this new language yeah what's opt-in and have
[1403.24 → 1409.50] to yeah probably because then they can at least look into it telling people 24 gigabytes of well
[1409.50 → 1415.20] okay it's even worse when they said 24 gigabytes of ram but when they say 24 gigabytes of memory and
[1415.20 → 1420.84] you have taught consumers for many years that when it lists memory they're talking about ram
[1420.84 → 1427.08] that's cagey it is it's weird you've taught people for a long time that specifically
[1427.08 → 1431.84] means ram when you're looking at stuff like laptops yeah and pre-built pcs they know what they're doing
[1431.84 → 1437.92] they do shame I think this can be done better I do know intel has had a really hard time marketing
[1437.92 → 1446.84] octane for a while um it's a good name though it is that's they could have got that way worse
[1446.84 → 1453.16] hey that's super chat octane is like an actual hardware for what used to be ready boost
[1453.16 → 1464.16] put that on the results i I just like thank you for the 20 bucks I appreciate it um i just who
[1464.16 → 1466.94] what's the name of the person who said that call him out
[1466.94 → 1471.82] Douglas Robinson rob Douglas
[1471.82 → 1481.42] no, no thank you very much um but yeah i I don't know i think i think they could have done
[1481.42 → 1487.88] a better job of marketing it um I think they could have worked with partners in the space
[1487.88 → 1492.96] uh like us and like other tech review well not use is a weird thing for me to say now but like you
[1492.96 → 1498.54] guys line of tech tips um and other hardware reviewers and stuff and gotten a clearer picture
[1498.54 → 1503.14] of what it is and where when it's going to be perfect because there are some situations where
[1503.14 → 1507.58] octane will make like a massive difference in terms of performance and there are some situations where it'll
[1507.58 → 1513.68] still make a difference but not like a huge one etc etc etc and making that more obvious uh I think
[1513.68 → 1520.32] I think would be good I don't know it's a cool product, and it's just it's going to be looked at poorly
[1520.32 → 1526.92] because of this, and it's just more confusing now speaking of looked at poorly Microsoft putting ads
[1526.92 → 1538.16] in the mail app oh m-a-i-l mail yeah not that they have an anyway apparently the beta version of
[1538.16 → 1543.42] Microsoft's mail client for Windows 10 has been placing ads right at the top of the inbox though
[1543.42 → 1549.42] the company has since turned off the feature and claims that it was just an experiment meant to be
[1549.42 → 1556.24] constrained to a small area it was uh tested in Brazil Canada Australia and India that's an
[1556.24 → 1564.58] interesting mix to yeah I guess let's not hit the U.S. yep yeah I think it's a mix the ads were visible
[1564.58 → 1571.00] on windows home and windows pro, but we're not on windows enterprise or windows EDU education
[1571.00 → 1579.78] no breathing wait so it was for pro users uh windows yeah windows pro and home and pro okay
[1579.78 → 1589.44] all right I mean I now removed FAQ page on Microsoft support website archived here we're not gonna
[1589.44 → 1594.56] bother to click on it though uh the company explains that it was running a pilot program testing ads in
[1594.56 → 1602.20] mail oh I don't use this app served to non-work accounts me neither who would uh set up through
[1602.20 → 1607.72] the mail including outlook.com Gmail and yahoo accounts users who have an Office 365 subscription
[1607.72 → 1613.70] which cost seven dollars per month or 70 a year linked to the email address were not shown ads
[1613.70 → 1620.86] I mean kudos to Microsoft for being really uh measuring everything no not even that like I like
[1620.86 → 1625.30] that they're kind of reinventing themselves they're like they're going back to fundamentals first
[1625.30 → 1630.00] principles thinking what works what doesn't works you know when they uh moved windows to a different
[1630.00 → 1635.12] business unit and all that changing the focus of their company cool test everything guys, and they said
[1635.12 → 1639.04] that their official statement was that this was just a little test even though it seemed like they
[1639.04 → 1643.82] actually had quite a bit of like support pages and stuff set up so it looked like it was a pretty
[1643.82 → 1654.50] serious effort but um yeah no one wants to use that app already and no one literally don't know a single
[1654.50 → 1662.60] person who uses the whoa and if someone does use it they probably don't want to like they're using it
[1662.60 → 1668.40] like at work or something you think yeah well no, but maybe this isn't windows enterprise who uses the
[1668.40 → 1676.60] mail app okay hold on I don't know um windows only answer this straw poll someone needs to fix their car
[1676.60 → 1686.96] alarm only answer this straw poll if you have Windows 10 um do you use the mail app in Windows 10
[1686.96 → 1694.68] can we get a yes, yes you're gonna no, no and I don't use Windows 10 but I'm here I don't use Windows 10
[1694.68 → 1702.46] but I'm here my dude yeah create that ball all right I want to see because like i really
[1702.46 → 1712.10] maybe in like a different geographic people are crazy about windows mail app but like i I don't know
[1712.10 → 1718.38] yeah maybe in Australia and India and Brazil yeah, and they just tested Canada like eastern Canada or
[1718.38 → 1723.92] something but like i I don't know anyone I really don't know is that the blue one that when I like
[1723.92 → 1729.50] when I click on a's email on a website it opens up that thing I'm not used to seeing is that
[1729.50 → 1738.90] what we're talking about make it go away oh look what's that wow, wow that's way more people than i
[1738.90 → 1747.56] expected there are dozens of us there are dozens of you there's 103 of you wow holy cow out of about
[1747.56 → 1753.40] 350 that voted that's a lot of people all right out of 450 that voted 100 I don't know why
[1753.40 → 1764.08] okay we need a follow-up poll another new poll yeah why um default have to like it
[1764.08 → 1772.32] like default as in I didn't change it like laziness lazy default slash lazy default slash lazy um
[1772.32 → 1780.02] I have to and that's like work or something like that they make me okay and I just like it
[1780.66 → 1787.88] like Matthew Connie in those Lincoln commercials I didn't do to be cool
[1787.88 → 1798.02] okay, okay hold on make a statement do do do do do do I just liked it
[1798.02 → 1803.58] our YouTube chat is so fast that it's basically useless
[1803.58 → 1809.26] who are you strange there anyway I also can't spam it so like I don't think anybody saw it
[1809.26 → 1817.90] in YouTube scroll up guys if you're on youtube, and you want to answer this strawpole.me slash 169 050
[1817.90 → 1827.74] 77 I repeat 169 050 77 you should show it that would probably be easier
[1827.74 → 1833.36] can you crank into that no you can't, you can't enlarge the toolbar that was dumb
[1833.36 → 1840.18] not the earl can you imagine what was I thinking you zoom in, and you're most people just like it
[1840.18 → 1848.34] wow that's interesting I just like it, I find it interesting that more people answered this one
[1848.34 → 1856.82] than answered that they do use it but whatever what that is most people saying I just like it
[1856.82 → 1864.50] um so should we try it interesting I don't use Windows 10 so I can't like this video if you think
[1864.50 → 1869.22] everyone in the office should switch to the mail app and make a video mail and get a bunch of ads
[1869.22 → 1875.98] maybe if they re-enable that thing yeah the timing will be perfect oh that's um yeah I don't want
[1875.98 → 1881.68] you know it's its kind of surprised me for a lot I mean I get it on like an on like a
[1881.68 → 1887.90] should be on our services kind of way, but it's always surprised me that email is essentially free
[1887.90 → 1894.40] like pretty much no one pays for email, and it's such a core thing like if you had to you would
[1894.40 → 1898.06] well you did pay at the very beginning and then Hotmail came out and Hotmail was the first free one
[1898.06 → 1905.52] that's fair I believe yeah and then Gmail is free because they take some data yeah but I like it
[1905.52 → 1911.10] I like when they take that data it enhances their services you're you're all about that though you've
[1911.10 → 1915.46] got the home you've got everything yeah you want it in your life oh it's so bizarre you're like yeah
[1915.46 → 1921.68] google oh i have to show me box s in my house now too it's like oh man it's a Google home, but it's
[1921.68 → 1927.02] made by china you've got America you get the data you get the data you get the data I don't even know
[1927.02 → 1932.40] I'm sending that's amazing let's do this lets let's yeah that's probably a good idea um
[1932.40 → 1934.64] savage jerky
[1934.64 → 1940.78] ours is in a cardboard box um I just want to do this for fun
[1940.78 → 1949.34] right when you said that I was like he's going to dump it over himself but I was still surprised
[1949.34 → 1952.10] I knew it was coming I was still like holy cow
[1952.10 → 1958.38] all right I mean it's Friday so it is I'm covered in meat Friday wow that's uh
[1958.38 → 1964.48] all right because they always sponsor the Sancho yeah that's good we got more yes

[1969.32 → 1974.30] one my favourite one is mojo jalapeño this one right here buddy it was open though no jalapeño
[1974.30 → 1982.00] oh that's habanero yeah wow I think wait how is this habanero, and it starts with a h and
[1982.00 → 1987.42] this must not be a Spanish word yeah probably not hmm I don't know the science you tell us
[1987.42 → 1995.16] you decide but back to savage jerky their jerky is made there we go this is my favourite one mojo
[1995.16 → 2000.30] jalapeño here we go anyway their jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or
[2000.30 → 2005.40] preservatives with a gold screen a snack that is both full of flavour and spice that won't be bad
[2005.40 → 2010.10] for you, they've got 13 different flavours of jerky people seem to love they're the most people seem to

[2259.36 → 2266.74] uh honey.com slash Linus do it up speaking of things to do lab grown meat is coming to us and a
[2266.74 → 2276.18] no yes it's coming Pia all right private internet access it's a VPN it secures you can get apps
[2276.18 → 2282.88] for windows macOS android iOS it still says Linus in here Linus and chrome you can get an app for
[2282.88 → 2288.90] Linus I'm not going to fix it uh with several other platforms coming soon obviously I'm in Linux I guess i
[2288.90 → 2295.52] fixed it uh connect up to five devices at the same time apps include DNS leak protection and ipv6 leak
[2295.52 → 2300.60] protection internet kill switch this is cool will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected
[2300.60 → 2306.62] unexpectedly that's important um check it out today in the link in the video description if you're
[2306.62 → 2315.94] watching the God uh or just go to private.com slash pages slash Linus dash tip text dash tips there we go
[2315.94 → 2323.82] private need access yeah lab grown internet privacy yeah I'm really this is my favourite future
[2323.82 → 2331.16] technology oh yeah me too more than self-driving cars uh probably I well I think it's more important to
[2331.16 → 2335.50] have this will be lab grown meat I think you know I'll give you that I think it will because if we
[2335.50 → 2341.12] yeah if we didn't have to have the sheer amount of cows look into the amount of cows that are
[2341.12 → 2346.04] literally just around for meat it's insane I think this will have a bigger impact on climate change
[2346.04 → 2351.86] than likely because their toots are like methane it's actually a huge problem they burp while
[2351.86 → 2357.42] they're eating tons of methane comes out of them not to mention all the water and land just to feed
[2357.42 → 2361.82] them yeah it's very inefficient you could use to make food but instead delicious eating supper
[2361.82 → 2368.34] inefficient anyway lab grown meat's going to be sweet and the U.S. and an is getting closer to having it in
[2368.34 → 2375.04] stores because the U.S. department of agriculture and the FDA food and drug administration have
[2375.04 → 2379.64] announced that they will be overseeing its production so it can be sold safely to consumers
[2379.64 → 2383.38] across the country the two agencies are going to be working together and this has been an ongoing
[2383.38 → 2389.56] thing before we were all wondering is it going to fall under the FDA because it's like a technology
[2389.56 → 2393.80] and lab culture stuff or is it going to fall under the food and drug administration or the um
[2393.80 → 2400.50] other guys department of agriculture because it's meat because they usually do all the uh livestock so
[2400.50 → 2406.50] question because you're probably I love this stuff but I haven't looked into it in at least a year
[2406.50 → 2411.70] and I think you're probably more up on it than me hopefully the AW burger what is that oh the beyond
[2411.70 → 2417.84] meat burger yeah that's pea protein okay yeah so people you pee in a bucket you put in no I'm
[2417.84 → 2422.50] just joking it's from the vegetable yeah yeah um because that's that's not really related to this
[2422.50 → 2428.58] no it's a different thing yeah it's good it's to me, it tastes like a sausage patty more than a burger
[2428.58 → 2436.34] but it's not bad it was pretty popular yeah it's still going yeah um but this is a whole
[2436.34 → 2441.66] different thing oh yeah, yeah so the images of when they were learning to do this really early on are
[2441.66 → 2447.42] like really very cool but really creepy at the same time they are very they're cool they really have
[2447.42 → 2452.82] you have seen this I don't think I've seen something that cool they're just it's weird seeing meat
[2452.82 → 2456.60] grown in labs so while Luke looks that up I'll keep reading here the two agencies are going to work
[2456.60 → 2461.38] together that's how it all shakes out the FDA is going to be in charge of regulating the collection
[2461.38 → 2466.90] banking and growing of cells used to make artificial meat you remember they start with
[2466.90 → 2472.84] cell with stem cells from a real animal, and then they scale that and make a giant culture from which
[2472.84 → 2477.98] they can create all these different like pieces of muscle it's not creepy that's obviously not that's
[2477.98 → 2482.14] not it that's not it I don't I can't is that a real is that real or just no it's photoshopped
[2482.14 → 2485.78] I can't find that'd be cool um, so there's going to be
[2485.78 → 2492.38] yeah okay so the add FDA has uh power over that part and then the USDA is going to work
[2492.38 → 2498.38] on the production and labelling of food products production and labelling, so there's going to be
[2498.38 → 2506.14] a transition from FDA to USDA oversight that transition happens during the health the cell
[2506.14 → 2512.32] harvest stage this regulatory framework will leverage both the FDA's experience regulating cell
[2512.32 → 2518.52] culture technology and living biosystems and the s the USDA's expertise in regulating livestock and
[2518.52 → 2526.20] poultry products for human consumption I don't know so they have at least one response from someone
[2526.20 → 2532.60] who works in this field at a uh a meat startup I guess cultured meat startup it's called new age
[2532.60 → 2537.60] meats this person says that the announcement here reduces uncertainty that allows us to move forward
[2537.60 → 2542.08] in developing innovative technology here in the United States yeah I mean that's with everything as soon
[2542.08 → 2546.72] as it gets regulated then you know what you're doing okay we have to go in this line yeah that's
[2546.72 → 2552.20] right um the joint framework allows us to more quickly create safe high-paying jobs in both research
[2552.20 → 2558.60] and development and manufacturing cool yeah really off-topic here I have to do a shout-out really quick
[2558.60 → 2565.56] apparently my mom works with a huge fan of the show uh wow way to walk right through it, you just
[2565.56 → 2572.84] walked over just walked with confidence uh so I'm supposed to show up Mitch Fraser thanks for
[2572.84 → 2577.96] being cool Mitch Fraser we got you got another person walking by we got it we got another person and
[2577.96 → 2583.32] they're going to have to leave again at some point this is a high traffic area but yeah that's very cool um
[2584.04 → 2588.76] I'm excited about that I like trying all the new ones when they come out oh yeah yeah we actually went down to
[2588.76 → 2594.28] the states and tried the Beyond Meat no the impossible impossible impossible yeah yeah how was
[2594.28 → 2602.20] that that one was though was okay what do you think compared to Beyond Meat uh okay the thing with the
[2602.20 → 2606.92] impossible burger is that it's like juicy like it's got the hemp in it so it's our heme so it's supposed
[2606.92 → 2613.88] to simulate a bloody burger the problem with it is it's its almost like a hash brown in its texture oh it's
[2613.88 → 2619.56] like a bunch of um like string like fibrous strings that are put together like more meatloaf
[2620.36 → 2627.96] so the texture is different yeah, but it's very tasty um the beyond me yeah that one's perfect
[2627.96 → 2633.16] I've had the w burger lots of times yeah lots of times so you're like into it several times and
[2633.16 → 2637.88] every time I go in there everyone in the lineup is ordering it and I thought it was just because I was
[2637.88 → 2643.56] on commercial drive in Vancouver so like of course but then I went to like small town, and they sold out
[2643.56 → 2649.32] to mission and the dude there was like everyone's getting this it's crazy I wish it was a little
[2649.32 → 2654.28] cheaper I haven't bought it well aw specific is kind of expensive it's like seven bucks for this
[2654.28 → 2659.80] burger and w's it's just the sandwich yeah yeah yeah four would be better apparently you can buy it
[2659.80 → 2665.88] like at safe way just at the grocery store like an aw branded one or like that beyond me oh yeah okay i
[2665.88 → 2670.84] think they might have discontinued that and because what happened was it released in a and w and then a
[2670.84 → 2676.20] and w ran out there was a supply shortage so it's possible that the company beyond me
[2677.32 → 2681.08] put all the resources to a and w and stopped selling other places yeah I don't know
[2682.60 → 2685.64] this is this is assumptions we're doing some assumptions don't know
[2687.08 → 2689.08] uh about this one
[2691.64 → 2695.24] yeah let's do it that kind of sucks because it's actually really cool, but valve has
[2695.24 → 2704.28] has discontinued steam link hardware what did you have one of those ever no you ever see one in
[2704.28 → 2710.84] real life I did so what the remaining stock is sold out in Europe almost sold out in the US if you want
[2710.84 → 2718.28] one now, and you're in the US move boy, so the steam link was the hardware anyway it was a 50
[2718.28 → 2724.68] little dude and what it did was it allowed you to stream games from a local gaming pc to a high
[2724.68 → 2729.96] definition television in the same house yeah pretty cool that's yeah really cool not bad
[2731.32 → 2735.32] but they don't do it anymore because they're all they're just focusing on the software stuff now
[2735.32 → 2740.44] some someone in the comments on artist technica.com said for anyone who doesn't know if you have a
[2740.44 → 2747.08] Samsung smart TV you can download the steam app onto your TV plug in any USB game pad and play
[2747.08 → 2755.80] that's really cool I have such a TV you should try it hmm see if it works so you've got all the
[2755.80 → 2766.28] devices that are spying on you dude I got spies I got spies in my house and every day spying on my dog
[2767.64 → 2772.68] listening to my dog you know the song I'm singing I vaguely recognize it but not really
[2772.68 → 2779.24] um I can't even say this song title because I was a swear in it speaking of uh vaguely recognized but
[2779.88 → 2784.28] Amazon Prime members can see Aquaman a week early pretty cool whoa
[2785.72 → 2791.24] pretty cool so wait you get to go to a cinema up to a week early if you're a prime member yeah because
[2791.24 → 2795.00] Amazon has all these cool partnerships with cinemas they've done that for a while
[2795.00 → 2800.04] why is that cool why is this a good thing um well it's cool if you're one of them I guess
[2800.60 → 2804.12] and actually it's not it's not really because considering it's in a cinema it's not really a
[2804.12 → 2809.40] week early it's just if you don't have it you're banned for a week well especially considering that
[2809.96 → 2813.56] the movie's already going to be out in China and Europe by the time this advanced
[2814.36 → 2820.12] happens in America yeah, and it's only select theatres how many does it say like a hundred or a
[2820.12 → 2825.24] thousand theatres in the US that's a big difference but wait that's the only ones where you're banned
[2825.24 → 2831.80] for a week no, no no, no the ones where yeah I guess the ones where this promotion is happening its
[2831.80 → 2837.88] limited selection of theatres see but this guy this is why people want to go see it early
[2838.44 → 2842.92] beast yeah I've seen he was in Vancouver apparently I've met several people who like got to hang out
[2842.92 → 2847.24] with him when he was here and like I've seen selfies and his hands are like bigger than people's entire
[2847.24 → 2853.24] heads he's a monster he's a beast yeah people in general that are attracted to men are going to
[2853.24 → 2858.36] want to go see that movie a week early I am suspecting so uh each subscriber is going to be able to
[2858.36 → 2863.40] purchase up to 10 tickets for a 7 p.m showing on December 15th just under a week before the film
[2863.40 → 2867.80] officially opens on December 21st what I'm wondering you can purchase up to 10 tickets yes do you think
[2867.80 → 2872.52] there's going to be like a resale market yes how much would people pay probably maybe not even that much
[2872.52 → 2876.76] they're just going to get scalped people will make five ten bucks on each ticket you're making 50 bucks
[2876.76 → 2888.04] 50 to 100 hell yeah money 10 tickets is a lot what the heck people are just walking by Aquaman
[2889.72 → 2895.16] sleep early I got tickets anybody want tickets I got tickets I'm buying tickets I'm selling tickets
[2896.12 → 2901.80] oh man yeah so that's going to happen at 1 000 participating cinemas across the U.S.
[2901.80 → 2908.36] including cinemas owned by AMC regal national amusement theatres arc light cinemas, and you can
[2908.36 → 2914.12] use okay, so apparently there were previous partnerships that saw early screenings of 2017's
[2914.12 → 2918.76] Jumanji and hotel Transylvania 3 hotel Transylvania 3.
[2918.76 → 2928.52] I've never heard of that there's three of them do you know hotel Transylvania 3
[2929.40 → 2933.80] it's a good movie I didn't know there was a second one wait did you know there's a first one yeah
[2933.80 → 2941.24] was it good I never watched it I knew it hell of a partnership Amazon sorry vampires you tell me i
[2941.24 → 2946.36] have the way it sounds like it would be vampires Pennsylvania so far we've got three people that
[2946.36 → 2953.32] really don't know what's going on um there's a warning see sonic why did I show you this page
[2953.32 → 2959.56] anyway see sonic issues a warning for potential video card compatibility issues oof it's a very small
[2959.56 → 2968.12] number of people I think people who have a focus plus power supply and an Asus GTX 970 strip if
[2968.12 → 2973.64] you have both of these things you may see a black screen under heavy VGA usage
[2975.96 → 2977.88] okay a big yawn comes out
[2979.72 → 2984.84] for if you have a focus plus, and you have Vega 56 or 64 this is a decent amount of people depending
[2984.84 → 2989.00] on how many see sonic power supplies there are because those are very common like the 970 strip
[2989.00 → 2993.40] is quite a how common are the focus plus power supplies I have now is that just an I don't know
[2993.40 → 2997.96] what part of their product line that is no idea it sounds like mid to low range
[2998.60 → 3003.40] yeah plus is this focus doesn't sound like a super like you know what I mean yeah I know what you
[3003.40 → 3009.00] mean yeah, yeah like uh like isn't see sonic's really high in line like the platinum no that's the
[3009.00 → 3013.08] freaking rating uh it has like a really cool silvery logo though yeah heck yeah it does
[3014.36 → 3019.08] yeah I was looking at like JVC I want to do car audio upgrade for my car and I was looking at some JVC
[3019.08 → 3025.72] speakers is this are we in like fast and the furious one release date time hey man I haven't
[3025.72 → 3031.56] heard anyone do a car audio upgrade to really like in forever best buy got rid of their car audio
[3031.56 → 3036.60] department that way I can't find it like across the country like it's like not a Black Friday
[3036.60 → 3046.60] deal get out of my face oh my goodness there we go okay anyway one of the like the lower line see
[3046.60 → 3053.08] prime sounds amazing good and that's their highest up I'm I'm assuming focus is lower the lower one i
[3053.08 → 3062.84] I saw for the JVC speakers was called club like JVC club 600 you're like yeah yeah those are low it looks
[3062.84 → 3068.68] like focus plus might be their like lowest one I'm really not sure well that means it's probably the
[3068.68 → 3077.80] most populous one probably hmm once again if you have dozen stuff or AMD stuff you may be getting
[3077.80 → 3087.00] shafted why what because you have a Vega, and you get the shot oh 56 or 64 but the GTX 970s there's a
[3087.00 → 3092.68] freaking insane amount of those sold there's probably more 970 strikes than there are like
[3092.68 → 3099.56] Vega 56s at home oh this is specifically strikes I wouldn't be too surprised
[3101.08 → 3107.00] Amazon leaked customer info I think they did it themselves they weren't even hacked
[3107.00 → 3115.08] if someone just did an own goal oh, oh crap oh okay I thought you didn't want me to click the thing
[3115.08 → 3122.52] I was like someone working there's they've declined to share further details no all they did was email
[3122.52 → 3129.16] the people affected so Amazon has emailed users to tell them that a technical error
[3129.16 → 3135.24] made their name and address visible on the Amazon website I don't know what part of the website
[3135.88 → 3143.32] it's a big site oh the email says the issue has been fixed it's not a result of anything you have done
[3143.32 → 3149.08] there's no need for you to change your password or take any action at all my bad your emails out there
[3149.08 → 3152.92] but you know you like getting spam someone could have seen that and screenshot it
[3154.12 → 3158.76] well some scraper probably picked it up yeah to be honest yeah oh it's not just people manually
[3158.76 → 3165.08] screenshotting then transcribing back in the day remember back in the day when we did have the
[3165.08 → 3170.52] internet, but it was tedious Amazon has not disclosed how many users were affected
[3170.52 → 3174.28] nobody knows thanks what if it was just like us
[3176.60 → 3183.24] the target of an attack from a rogue agent like that guy who quit or got fired from twitter and then
[3183.24 → 3189.96] uh shut down Trump's yeah yeah yeah I remember count that time for 10 minutes Samsung's transport
[3189.96 → 3201.24] oh my goodness you see google ah Mozilla Firefox I'll switch browsers if you handle this
[3202.28 → 3209.00] as long as it doesn't crash I used to love Firefox dude I have a little Firefox dragon plushier at home
[3209.00 → 3214.12] I have multiple like I support Firefox shirts remember when the new one came out it was an eight, and they're
[3214.12 → 3219.48] like yeah it's faster than chrome now it's sick, and then it was like you got that one right yeah you tried it
[3219.48 → 3227.40] and then it crashed a lot columnar I like the word columnar oh yeah because Samsung columnar
[3227.40 → 3234.92] columnar transparent OLED yeah so it's a transparent OLED, and then you bend it in a circle, and now it's
[3234.92 → 3239.72] columnar and uh does that mean there's like a hologram in the middle I don't think so but it
[3239.72 → 3243.96] might have that effect I think it might look like that's what I mean yeah obviously it's not projecting
[3243.96 → 3248.36] it's just an OLED that's bent is this going to be no it's an ad, so there's we know nothing about this
[3248.36 → 3253.00] there's basically a tweet from ice universe who's like a famous leaker person leaked it and in the
[3253.00 → 3258.44] caption of the picture that you that there's no video it just is there I'm hoping is it just a
[3258.44 → 3263.40] video of a picture no oh yeah it's unrelated that's the only picture we have that's what it was tweeted
[3263.40 → 3269.40] the tweet that went along with it said something like it could be used in speakers and I think that's
[3269.40 → 3275.24] a kind of junk picture this is an official no it's a leak that's a leak I think used in speakers means like
[3275.24 → 3281.80] if you've got a columnar speaker and there 's could be like a little columnar transparent OLED
[3281.80 → 3288.28] on the top, and it just does cool visualizations okay that would be a lot more money for not much
[3288.28 → 3294.12] value but sure one thing I'm excited about is for this kind of stuff to show up in like public areas
[3294.12 → 3299.96] yeah like uh airports shopping malls heck yeah because that'll just feel like oh I'm in the video
[3299.96 → 3303.16] games I played when I was a kid yeah or a minority report when you just run through the mall, and they're
[3303.16 → 3307.80] like hey Mr so-and-so we just read your eyes, and now we know what you want because like the idea
[3307.80 → 3312.92] yeah yeah that'll be cool did you go through CES you were not CS last year were you yeah you were
[3312.92 → 3318.60] remember uh did you go through the LG cavern of bendy olds they made it look like a Grand Canyon
[3318.60 → 3323.88] type that was wild that was cool that was really wild the walls were all flexible bendy and they
[3323.88 → 3329.16] were displaying images of like Arizona the amount of money they spend like a cavern ludicrous
[3329.16 → 3334.28] that was cool though no one else is ludicrous it's in my memory that was worth it for me this is
[3334.28 → 3339.96] fair what's ludicrous the time let's get out of here I think we're done see ya thanks guys thanks
[3339.96 → 3344.44] for watching I appreciate it well actually we're not going to be done, yet we're going to skim through some
[3344.44 → 3350.04] yeah some uh super-duper super chats someone said just got a switch with breath of the wild game
[3350.04 → 3354.76] suggestions I don't know if you're going to be into it, but there's a game called golf story sounds really
[3354.76 → 3360.52] weird it's a golf RPG you start as someone who sucks at golf, and then you have to win all the
[3360.52 → 3365.56] tournaments, and you have to like to make money to buy new clubs, and you make money by doing jobs and you
[3365.56 → 3371.08] find a way to use your golf clubs for all the jobs so one of them is like mow the lawn, and you have to
[3371.08 → 3375.80] like hit a golf club at a lawnmower and hit it in the right way, so the lawnmower will start and go mow
[3375.80 → 3380.68] things I wish I was in the pitch meeting for this it is hilarious it is a very funny it's very
[3380.68 → 3385.48] entertaining game it's really long you get a lot of your money nice get if it's great check it out
[3385.48 → 3394.04] I love how it shows the currencies here yeah a sec we got 40 sec uh the 40 sec just said PewDiePie
[3394.04 → 3399.96] hey why do we have this thing here is this for a reason this is no okay um yeah help him stay number
[3399.96 → 3406.84] one defeat t-series uh laser jams for the win uh I'm sad Linus meantime didn't make the cut
[3407.64 → 3414.04] uh wins Ltd 2019 do we have a date when is it uh I don't know I don't know if we have a date
[3414.04 → 3418.84] I don't think, so there's a website isn't there I don't know if the website isn't updated it means
[3418.84 → 3424.12] we don't have a date, yet you can probably google it I'm not sure what the website is uh I'm not reading
[3424.12 → 3431.64] all the super chats I'm sorry blah blah with the MSI 2070 aero it out soon are you guys thinking of
[3431.64 → 3437.56] updating the SFF cases roundup with cases that make use of it without limiting CPU
[3438.84 → 3443.96] I don't think either of us are going to know that answer um and i kind of doubt it copies and paste
[3443.96 → 3449.40] that to an email we'll talk about it in the writers meeting maybe okay uh this is wrong how about I'll
[3449.40 → 3455.64] get that later uh what's the best mail app and how do I remove utilities like mail uh I would look
[3455.64 → 3459.80] somewhere else for a guide on how do you remove that stuff I don't know if you necessarily can't
[3459.80 → 3465.00] there's probably some way to like block it what's the best mail app your web browser probably um
[3467.24 → 3470.92] I think I'm over windows as a service I think a lot of people are maybe not that many
[3470.92 → 3477.48] obtain yeah we already read that one you block notice from all sites in chrome oh cool oh thanks
[3477.48 → 3483.40] Suva they see they listen to us heck yeah I'm going to have to google how to do that sick someone said please
[3483.40 → 3490.20] explain that oh please explain the hat oh well this is a hat that comes off our prop wall which
[3490.20 → 3496.52] happens to be so close to the wan show set that I could hang the hat on the wall actually pretty close
[3496.52 → 3500.76] if that was a free peg and there wasn't a Santa hat on it that might have worked because it was angled
[3500.76 → 3504.84] nicely and everything if you would have just played it cool we could have told the audience that it did work
[3504.84 → 3516.68] I'm out of here hey you guys for watching we'll see you next time intro button I'm back in the brain but
[3516.68 → 3518.28] you can't, I was going to say
