[0.00 --> 5.38]  on this show. You know we're live, right? That's why we should tell everyone. Good, then that's not
[5.38 --> 9.60]  going to be a problem because we're telling everyone on this show. Later. What are we
[9.60 --> 15.62]  telling? Yeah, later, later. It's WAN Showtime! Yeah! Actually it was WAN Showtime half an hour
[15.62 --> 21.48]  ago but I was doing something really important. Very important. Are you going to show them?
[21.72 --> 29.98]  No, I can't. Oh. No, I know. It's like, it's a whole thing. Oh. Like it's a thing. Okay.
[30.00 --> 35.92]  Yeah. So. That's fair. Because it's a thing, I can't show them the thing. Because that's like a,
[36.40 --> 42.24]  that's kind of the point. It's kind of the thing. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I really, oh man, I really
[42.24 --> 47.82]  wish I could show you because I'm so excited. I've never been this excited about, maybe not never,
[47.92 --> 53.54]  but I haven't been this excited about a package of technology arriving. What about? Probably this
[53.54 --> 58.06]  year. What about, okay, okay. Like. Because I don't think that was this year. But the last time you did
[58.06 --> 62.26]  something somewhat similar, it was like a bunch of packages. That was, that was pretty cool too.
[62.36 --> 66.08]  That was, that was equally cool. Okay. Equally cool. All right. Um, so guys, we've got a great show
[66.08 --> 72.52]  for you today. Here, we're live on, uh, YouTube, Twitch, and Flowplane.com. We've got actually a bunch
[72.52 --> 77.38]  of Flowplane updates for you. We've got some Linus Tech Tips updates for you. We have a new merch store.
[77.66 --> 81.12]  Hey! It has higher quality shirts and also some designs that are like,
[81.12 --> 85.18]  is that even Linus Tech Tips? I don't know. It just kind of looks cool. I don't,
[85.64 --> 89.78]  who knows? You actually can't make out the only thing about it that is LTT.
[90.10 --> 97.38]  Yeah. No. Which is the LTT that's kind of traced in the constellations in the sky above the mountain
[97.38 --> 106.04]  thing. Don't worry. It's chill. It's all good. Um, so we've got a lot of great topics for you guys
[106.04 --> 112.82]  today. There's a rumor circulating that Nvidia will be launching the GTX 11 series. I think
[112.82 --> 117.30]  you're going to need more like tech wiki, what the heck is going on episodes? Cause like, wow,
[117.40 --> 122.20]  this is, this is, this is great. Yeah. This is going to get pretty confusing. And speaking of
[122.20 --> 129.94]  equally awesome, iPad pros are apparently shipping bent, which Apple does not consider to be a defect.
[130.02 --> 133.48]  Nope. By design. Moron this at 11. Get it? Moron.
[133.48 --> 140.50]  Moron. Oh, rank 11. I've made that joke before. It's just been a while. Yeah. Uh,
[140.50 --> 149.06]  Fortnite is being sued for the Carlton dance by Carlton, I guess. Yeah. Like Carlton, the hotels?
[149.58 --> 156.06]  No. What? Like Rick's Carlton? Fresh Prince. You don't know? Oh, that Carlton. Yeah. Wait,
[156.16 --> 163.24]  what? His like dance is in Fortnite. I don't know what his dance is, so I can't do it. What? Yeah.
[163.48 --> 168.56]  Okay. Well, I haven't, I'm not, I'm not up on. Talk more about that later. And the boring company
[168.56 --> 173.98]  tunnel demo is apparently disappointing. So you're such a fan boy. You're going to find a way to not
[173.98 --> 177.42]  be disappointed about it, but we can do that later. No, it's actually pretty disappointing.
[177.42 --> 177.70]  Whoops.
[178.20 --> 178.54]  There.
[178.54 --> 208.18]  I believe so. I believe so. Okay.
[208.54 --> 215.54]  All right. Fine. I guess. I see why we do it this way.
[215.74 --> 221.84]  Maybe I'm totally off my rock. It's just a pain. Oh, how was your week?
[221.84 --> 230.84]  Actually really good. Guess what got enabled? I haven't seen anyone complaining about it yet.
[230.84 --> 238.96]  I have seen someone in the chat said stream looks great from Spain. So that's good, which would make
[238.96 --> 244.08]  sense because we have a server somewhat near there. The cool thing that was enabled this week that
[244.08 --> 250.38]  wasn't enabled last week on float plane on float plane is that we now have a sort of load balancing
[250.38 --> 256.04]  for live streams, which is cool. It's like, like duct tape and like popsicle sticks. It's not like
[256.04 --> 261.48]  super intelligent load balancing, but there's a little bit of load balancing. And last week we
[261.48 --> 268.54]  were on one box now just about lit it on fire. Yes. And now we're on like all of the edges that
[268.54 --> 273.18]  normally serve normal video content from float plane. You should probably explain for the
[273.18 --> 278.30]  uninitiated what an edge is. So an edge server. So you have like your, your main browser. It's got
[278.30 --> 283.00]  this great engine designed by Microsoft. Not anymore. Just kidding. I know, right?
[283.90 --> 289.54]  That's pretty weird. Um, but so, so edge servers are like, there's the, the, the main servers that
[289.54 --> 293.92]  like store all your data and like receive videos and transcode videos and do all that kind of stuff.
[294.16 --> 298.42]  The edge servers are generally closer to people. That's why they're called edge servers on the edge.
[298.84 --> 303.02]  Um, and they are the ones that actually serve the video to you. So now the live streams are
[303.02 --> 307.62]  actually going to those boxes instead of just being delivered from one. Does it look a little
[307.62 --> 311.58]  better? It looks really good actually. Yeah. I'm a little out of focus cause I'm leaning forward to
[311.58 --> 315.34]  look at my laptop, but when I'm sitting here normally, like here, I'm just going to turn my
[315.34 --> 320.34]  brightness up a little bit so you can see. Yeah. I think it looks pretty good. Right now we don't
[320.34 --> 325.76]  have manual selectors for quality. So yeah, sorry about that. That will be coming at some point.
[325.84 --> 331.08]  I don't have like a very specific. And even if he did, he probably wouldn't deliver it at that time.
[331.08 --> 335.08]  Nope. Get wrecked. Software enrollment. Yeah.
[337.80 --> 340.04]  It's been two years. Who even knows?
[340.06 --> 343.76]  Still in alpha. Speaking of been two years, we have two factor now.
[343.86 --> 352.48]  Yay. Actually, there's a lot of stuff happening over the next probably four to six weeks and
[352.48 --> 360.66]  some of it even sooner. So yes. Um, for accounting reasons, yeah. Floatplane through the forum is going
[360.66 --> 370.76]  to be going away. Yeah. Like in 10 days. So our fiscal year end is, um, December 31st for both Linus
[370.76 --> 375.32]  media group and floatplane media. Yeah. Um, we synced that up. We synced that up. That was,
[375.32 --> 379.64]  there was a rationale behind it. I forget why, but whatever we did it. Not our department. Yeah.
[380.60 --> 386.58]  Doesn't matter. Um, but anyway, they both have their fiscal year ends and up until now,
[386.58 --> 393.12]  the accounting between the two companies has been sort of complicated because, um, the money comes
[393.12 --> 401.18]  into the Linus tech tips forum, which is owned by Linus media group. Then it has to be passed through
[401.18 --> 409.14]  to floatplane media, which is its own ownership structure. Then floatplane media has to take its
[409.14 --> 417.32]  cut from the user subscription fee and then give the money back to Linus media group Inc. And then
[417.32 --> 424.22]  also the calculations for any taxes and deductions for, uh, processing fees, like payment processing
[424.22 --> 430.36]  fees has to be done somewhere in there. And it has been quite frankly, untenable. We just cannot
[430.36 --> 435.48]  continue to do this. Um, so the reality of it is we're going to have to do it at some point.
[435.48 --> 440.26]  We're going to find a way. Well, not just not, we're going to find a way we have a way that we're,
[440.26 --> 443.78]  that we're pitching to everyone who's subscribed through the forum that we're going to be able
[443.78 --> 449.90]  to make it more palatable with. And, um, I forget exactly what the plan is, but okay. So there's a few
[449.90 --> 459.06]  plans. One of them is if you are subscribed on the new website on January 31st, it's going to be like a
[459.06 --> 464.46]  one time flip over, make sure you're done before January 31st. I don't know when on January 31st
[464.46 --> 469.06]  it's going to happen, but like it's happening on that day. We're not giving warning. So just sign
[469.06 --> 474.68]  up now. Yeah. Better strat us, bitwit tech deals, whoever it is you want to be subscribed to.
[475.96 --> 479.60]  Yeah. Every single person actively subscribed to that time. It doesn't matter if you were still
[479.60 --> 482.58]  in the forum. It doesn't matter if you're already on the new site, et cetera. You just have to be
[482.58 --> 488.32]  subscribed on the new site, flowplane.com before January 31st. And if you are, have an active
[488.32 --> 493.42]  subscription at that time, we are giving you two free months for everybody you're subscribed to.
[493.54 --> 499.02]  And Kyle, uh, Jason, if you guys are watching, uh, chill, uh, we're going to top you up for anyone
[499.02 --> 504.98]  that we gave free months to. You will be handled. Um, also if you are subscribed to that time,
[504.98 --> 510.94]  you'll be getting an exclusive one time only accessible, uh, emoji in the chat that you can
[510.94 --> 516.60]  use across all chats. We're not even sure what it is yet, but that will become a thing by January 31st.
[516.60 --> 519.14]  And it might even be cool. I think Ed's going to do it. Is that right?
[519.24 --> 526.20]  I haven't asked him yet, but yeah, I don't know. I guess Lloyd also exists. We'll talk to someone.
[526.26 --> 530.86]  Yeah, we'll figure it out. Um, and then, uh, eventually I don't have a specific date for
[530.86 --> 535.80]  this probably before January 31st, but we're cutting off your access before then. So, ha ha ha. Um,
[535.80 --> 542.30]  the linustechdips.com website will have embedded player from floatplane.com. You'll just only be
[542.30 --> 547.76]  able to see it if you're subscribed through floatplane.com. So we're getting rid of subscriptions
[547.76 --> 552.86]  on the forum. They're going to be gone. But you can still have your discussion about the video
[552.86 --> 560.46]  on the forum if that tickles your pickle. Yes. But like the, the ability to have that video playing
[560.46 --> 565.26]  there, I don't entirely know when that will be ready. Uh, but yeah, we're, we're switching the
[565.26 --> 569.22]  like main source cause all the payments really need to go through floatplane.com.
[569.24 --> 573.18]  They have to go through floatplane.com. It's an absolute nightmare the way that it is now.
[573.22 --> 578.04]  It's just not sustainable. It's a problem. Um, and these, and we are getting to the point where
[578.04 --> 584.94]  we're close enough to launching some other really key features that it's really, really important to
[584.94 --> 591.68]  get this clean now because we could be adding more creators sooner rather than later. Um, especially
[591.68 --> 598.06]  in light of some of the news that has come out around, you know, other, um, self-funding platforms
[598.06 --> 603.58]  and stuff like that. There's a fair bit of controversy at the moment. So we are kind of looking at that
[603.58 --> 611.02]  going, well, if only gosh, darn it. If only there was some alternative from, you know, someone else that,
[611.02 --> 616.22]  you know, if only that were a thing, if only someone has been working on it for a while and
[616.22 --> 622.52]  it's like finally kind of coming together. Yeah. If only, if only, ah, darn. It's a shame, isn't it?
[622.52 --> 629.24]  Yeah. That's such a thing. Just if only just, yeah. Um, also, uh, some other, some other pretty
[629.24 --> 638.18]  cool, uh, uh, floatplane news. Um, the final episode of secret shopper is live on floatplane.
[638.18 --> 641.74]  I haven't seen it yet, but I'm really excited. So if you guys want to go check it out, that's
[641.74 --> 649.36]  floatplane.com. Um, just go sign up and then you can always like cancel after a month if that was
[649.36 --> 654.26]  the only video that you wanted to watch or whatever. But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's awesome.
[654.46 --> 660.26]  Basically it's, it's a, so far the feedback on it is really good. Not everyone agrees with our
[660.26 --> 665.74]  conclusion though. And I would be really, really interested to see what you guys think. Also,
[665.74 --> 670.54]  I should be careful with the word final because we've had a lot of requests from our floatplane
[670.54 --> 677.56]  members already that, um, for a fifth episode where we reach out to every one of the companies
[677.56 --> 684.08]  and either invite a representative on to come and say their piece or like read out their letters.
[684.24 --> 690.00]  Yeah. Um, yeah. Like full transparency, telling them who we are seeking comment.
[690.00 --> 694.72]  Now that you have seen all these videos, you've heard feedback from customers because I've seen
[694.72 --> 700.10]  people tweeting different companies and stuff. It's gotten a little real. Um, what, what do you
[700.10 --> 702.42]  want to say? You can add your voice. I love that. That's awesome.
[702.50 --> 708.36]  So that may happen because we've, we've, I've been reached out to personally by the CEO of at least
[708.36 --> 714.42]  one of the companies with comments. Uh, I've been also reached out to personally, um, by PR managers
[714.42 --> 722.30]  for some of these companies. Um, I, I will say this, Janice got a personal apology from iBuyPower.
[723.04 --> 729.72]  Um, they actually get this, they subscribed to floatplane so they could be keeping an eye on this
[729.72 --> 736.16]  a week early before it would hit YouTube. That's awesome. Respect by the way, to every single one of
[736.16 --> 744.40]  them for doing absolutely nothing to damage the editorial process for us. So whether they
[744.40 --> 753.02]  had the best value as a gaming rig or whether they, um, had a poor, a poor showing in pre-sales
[753.02 --> 761.00]  or customer support or packaging or whatever else, every single one of them not only didn't,
[761.00 --> 766.68]  you know, threaten us or, or, or behave in such a manner because technically, you know,
[766.78 --> 771.72]  they're, it would be tough because we're Canadian and they're all American. So technically they could
[771.72 --> 777.08]  have at least sent a threatening letter about us recording the calls without telling them or
[777.08 --> 782.66]  whatever the case may be. Not only did nobody behave in that manner, which I didn't think
[782.66 --> 788.86]  they would. I mean, that's making a bad PR situation a lot worse. You go in like, sue Linus
[788.86 --> 794.56]  tech tips because they showed that your customer support sucks. I don't think they would lose
[794.56 --> 800.00]  anyways. Like that's a bad, bad move. I'm pretty sure all of Canada's single party consent, but not
[800.00 --> 808.84]  only that, but every single one of them that reached out to us said, Hey, we have a comment
[808.84 --> 815.82]  or whatever, but we completely respect the work you guys are doing and we're not going to interfere.
[816.04 --> 821.26]  That's let us know if you want to chat when it's over. That's cool. I really, I, I am in strong
[821.26 --> 827.34]  support of that final episode. So I think that'd be really cool. Someone, someone on the flow plane
[827.34 --> 831.56]  chat said, wow, quality is so much better on flow plane. Yes. I think that's not going to be
[831.56 --> 836.82]  necessarily true for everyone, but we're trying. Yeah. Um, uh, honestly there was, there was another
[836.82 --> 840.26]  comment. There's been a few different comments talking about, I'm supposed to look at somebody's
[840.26 --> 844.84]  name who starts with dark and I lost it, but I had already read it. So it's okay. Uh, he was asking
[844.84 --> 849.42]  for, Oh, dark force. There it is. Dark force. Dark force says tutorial for moving
[849.42 --> 855.86]  LTD for membership to flow plane would be awesome. It's pretty easy. If you want a tutorial,
[855.86 --> 861.80]  uh, I don't remember the exact menu titles, but it's some, it's just go to your, uh, like
[861.80 --> 866.56]  go to the store online, sec tips.com, go to your settings or subscriptions or whatever.
[866.84 --> 872.48]  Click the cancel button, go to full plane.com subscribe. And you can also cancel within your PayPal
[872.48 --> 879.40]  dashboard. Also that that's a foolproof way to do it. It's not the same as like, um, issuing
[879.40 --> 883.66]  a, uh, like a chargeback through PayPal. Like we don't get penalized or anything like that.
[883.84 --> 888.64]  It's not quite as clean. So if you're doing it to a site that's like running actively,
[888.64 --> 894.82]  not as cool necessarily, but we're nuking all of the line of sec tips side anyways. So we don't care.
[894.82 --> 899.80]  Just can't just stop the billing agreement somehow. Doesn't really matter. But yeah,
[899.80 --> 905.24]  if you're doing that to a site that's actively running, they're not necessarily going to know
[905.24 --> 909.58]  why the billing agreement stopped. Oh, so PayPal's API doesn't. Because they're probably using
[909.58 --> 913.62]  Braintree and PayPal and Braintree don't like properly communicate about everything. Aren't
[913.62 --> 918.70]  they owned by the same? Yup. It's terrible. Uh, so like depending on how the implementation works,
[918.74 --> 923.06]  it might not necessarily notice why. So it might think that it failed for a bad reason. And then
[923.06 --> 927.22]  like try again or it might, well, it won't try again because the billing agreements canceled,
[927.40 --> 931.94]  but it might like automatically reach out to you and be like, Hey, billing failed and we don't
[931.94 --> 938.60]  really know why. Beautiful. Perfect. Makes sense. Um, yeah. Oh, people are asking about
[938.60 --> 942.96]  yearly subscriptions. We'll take care of you. Send me a message or, or send full plane help
[942.96 --> 946.32]  at gmail.com a message. You will be handled. You will get your free two months, all that
[946.32 --> 951.54]  kind of stuff. Can we get a new alias for a help? Yeah. Like just support at floatplane.com
[951.54 --> 956.48]  or something? Yeah. Okay. Is there like any reason that couldn't be done like right away?
[956.96 --> 960.06]  Uh, a little bit of one. Other than just the cost of another, of another inbox or?
[960.06 --> 965.46]  Or somewhat. Is it like hard coded into things? No, it's not actually. We don't have a gapps
[965.46 --> 971.36]  account for at floatplane. We don't? No, because it's at floatplane media. I thought we got one.
[971.46 --> 980.14]  Not a gapps account. Really? So currently we're paying nothing for it. Oh, I see. Okay. And
[980.14 --> 985.46]  an individual gapps account. Okay. All right. If you, you should make a group for it and have
[985.46 --> 992.00]  individual people as the gapps accounts, but there's no one to put that on. Sure. So I just
[992.00 --> 996.02]  haven't really. Okay. We'll do it though. Yeah. Well, we'll, we'll get on that. It won't
[996.02 --> 1000.80]  because like, honestly, when, when people reach out to Linus media group, like they're like,
[1000.84 --> 1005.22]  yeah, we are a very professional Amazon seller with, you know, many great products. We'd like
[1005.22 --> 1010.54]  to, we'd like to sponsor your channel or whatever. And it's sent from Gmail. Delete.
[1010.54 --> 1016.30]  Yeah. We'll, we'll fix that. Literally every time. Oh, well, I also want to have just like
[1016.30 --> 1021.80]  a support page. Yes. That you can contact. That would be good. We should, we should have
[1021.80 --> 1025.46]  that. That's, that's, that's actually pretty much done. It's just not in yet. It'll be in
[1025.46 --> 1031.76]  soon. Talk about 2FA being added. Yeah. 2FA is added. Uh, when you, when you log in
[1031.76 --> 1036.88]  floatplane.com, click on the little widget in the corner, go to your settings, go to security
[1036.88 --> 1041.88]  and then we're legitimately actually making progress now. Yeah. Yay. Well, not what we
[1041.88 --> 1045.84]  were before, but like you can see it now. More tangible stuff. We're doing a lot of backend
[1045.84 --> 1050.20]  stuff before, which is less fun for other people. G suite, whatever, man. He knew what
[1050.20 --> 1058.92]  I meant. Uh, okay. So let's go ahead and jump into an actual news topic. Yeah. That's well,
[1058.92 --> 1066.64]  I mean, this is actual news. It's just news about us. And also like what? What? No, no, no,
[1066.64 --> 1071.64]  no problem. Um, it was mentioned at one point in time that Linus Tech Tips subscriptions
[1071.64 --> 1076.78]  were going to cost more. Is that happening now? Or is that happening when we leave beta?
[1077.78 --> 1085.50]  I don't know. Yeah. I have no idea. What a tremendous, wonderful question. So right now it's,
[1085.50 --> 1095.00]  we've actually given very little, a thought to a cohesive, um, floatplane subscriptions slash YouTube
[1095.00 --> 1102.86]  memberships slash whatever other sort of direct support plans there are. To be clear, just so
[1102.86 --> 1107.00]  everyone knows with this whole plan that was already in place, if you were already subscribed,
[1107.10 --> 1110.90]  your subscription was not being bumped. You were being grandfathered in at whatever you were at
[1110.90 --> 1118.42]  already. Um, we were just going to increase the cost for new users. Uh, but we don't know if we're
[1118.42 --> 1125.08]  going to do that or not. Um, so, so yeah, we don't have a cohesive strategy, uh, right now over on
[1125.08 --> 1132.04]  YouTube, it's five bucks. Okay. On floatplane, it's three on YouTube. You don't get early access
[1132.04 --> 1138.84]  on floatplane you do. So this pricing structure really doesn't make a ton of sense. Yeah. Um,
[1139.74 --> 1144.54]  YouTube has features that we simply won't be able to deliver on floatplane at this time,
[1144.54 --> 1149.46]  like stories. Okay. So, so there's, there's that, I guess, but that has nothing to do with
[1149.46 --> 1155.30]  memberships because right now there's no way to do a members specific story. And then, um,
[1156.32 --> 1161.24]  they're both going to get live streams from now on. Actually, it was just a total like brain fart that
[1161.24 --> 1166.14]  the, uh, oil PC build stream earlier today didn't go on floatplane. We'll deal with that next time.
[1166.68 --> 1173.82]  Um, and then floatplane also has sort of other things that are going to be coming later,
[1173.82 --> 1178.48]  but that won't be over there. So we, we just, we just really don't know what to do right now.
[1179.22 --> 1186.40]  There, I said it. Some people are pointing out that the forum is at $2.99 and floatplane,
[1186.56 --> 1197.64]  it is $3.00. Really? So we got rid of the penny in Canada. Um, yeah. If you guys want to catch up,
[1197.64 --> 1208.22]  $2.99 is actually, actually $3.00. Um, I mean, okay, no, you know what? No, I'm not conceding on
[1208.22 --> 1214.58]  this one. I was going to say, okay, that is 10 cents in a year, 12, but like,
[1214.58 --> 1221.24]  I think it's fine. Okay. I think we're fine. Oh, why don't we talk about the Carlton dance?
[1221.36 --> 1226.94]  What the hell is a Carlton dance? I don't know. Okay. Cause like, I didn't really, I wasn't like,
[1226.94 --> 1231.10]  I know it's a thing. I think you like swing your arms back and forth and like do something,
[1231.26 --> 1236.98]  but I don't really know. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Oh man. What is this? Okay. This video is
[1236.98 --> 1244.06]  restricted from playing in your current geographic region. Wow. Well, you know what? I think we can kind of
[1244.06 --> 1249.70]  get the point. Yeah. I think you like throw your hips out and like flail your arms up and then
[1249.70 --> 1256.28]  snap and then the other way. So the article here is blah, blah, blah. The Carlton dance was a
[1256.28 --> 1263.90]  trademark of Ribeiro's iconic character. And he's now claiming that the fresh emote in Fortnite is an
[1263.90 --> 1272.90]  exact replica of his well known moves. Has Alfonso Ribeiro checked the year lately?
[1274.06 --> 1277.86]  Does that matter? Are those moves that well known anymore?
[1279.52 --> 1282.92]  The emote's called fresh. I think people are pretty aware.
[1283.86 --> 1289.56]  I think the developers were aware of what they were doing, but I think in the context of anyone
[1289.56 --> 1299.02]  under 25, it's a Fortnite dance. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I still don't think that gives you grounds.
[1299.02 --> 1302.40]  At what point does John Travolta be like, you can't do this?
[1305.18 --> 1313.50]  I mean, I would make the argument that that Saturday Night Fever, that movie cover is far
[1313.50 --> 1316.58]  more iconic than anything Alfonso Ribeiro has ever done.
[1316.72 --> 1320.20]  To go, I, in the end, I agree with you, but to go against you for a second.
[1320.20 --> 1321.90]  Oh, I'm playing devil's advocate right now. Okay. Yeah.
[1321.90 --> 1325.16]  I'm just having some fun. So go ahead. Say whatever you want to say.
[1325.16 --> 1328.26]  I was going to say, it doesn't matter that something's more iconic. You still defend your trademark.
[1329.34 --> 1335.96]  Like, like, like, yeah. Apple's kind of a bigger deal or YouTube or, or Patreon or Apple or Microsoft.
[1335.96 --> 1340.24]  They're all kind of a bigger deal than Floatplane and Lime's Media Group, but we would defend our trademark
[1340.24 --> 1343.32]  to a certain degree. We'll do our best.
[1343.32 --> 1349.44]  Like if someone put like LTT edition on like some hardware in a computer, we'd be like, hey dog.
[1349.44 --> 1350.58]  You actually can't do that.
[1350.60 --> 1351.28]  What are you doing?
[1351.38 --> 1351.50]  Yeah.
[1351.56 --> 1352.50]  That's not okay.
[1353.44 --> 1356.00]  But this dance.
[1357.62 --> 1361.64]  Dance moves are traditionally very hard to protect this way.
[1363.08 --> 1363.52]  Yeah.
[1364.20 --> 1371.46]  Like, as far as I've heard, you can protect the specific choreography, but you can't actually
[1371.46 --> 1377.14]  protect like performing the dance. And then that gets weird because it's like in a game.
[1377.14 --> 1381.88]  Another thing I was actually really confused about is what actually gives him the right
[1381.88 --> 1382.34]  to sue.
[1383.08 --> 1387.66]  That is something that I was kind of going to bring up as well.
[1387.66 --> 1389.16]  Because it's his character. It's not him.
[1389.36 --> 1394.14]  It's his character. I mean, that's, that's another really tricky thing.
[1394.14 --> 1399.52]  Like I could never, this isn't really relevant anymore, but I could never, it's not the same
[1399.52 --> 1402.68]  thing. It's a name, whatever. Ignore that part. I could never see someone over the use
[1402.68 --> 1404.14]  of slick as a thingy.
[1404.92 --> 1405.20]  No.
[1405.20 --> 1408.80]  Because that was, or like, uh, that was not me that did that.
[1408.82 --> 1413.48]  But then here's the thing. Catchphrases have been successfully trademarked. Like the let's
[1413.48 --> 1415.10]  get ready to, I'm not going to say it.
[1415.16 --> 1419.04]  Okay. Yeah. But wasn't that because he was an independent actor?
[1419.72 --> 1420.10]  Yes.
[1420.36 --> 1425.32]  This is, he was on a show. There was producers, there was executive producers, there's people
[1425.32 --> 1427.20]  that owned the trademark of Fresh Prince.
[1427.20 --> 1432.08]  Yes. There's, there's, there's copyright holders involved in this process that are not
[1432.08 --> 1436.10]  him. He was paid to be on the show. I don't think he owned, he might, I could be wrong.
[1436.10 --> 1439.70]  No, I don't think so. But let's assume he isn't. Um, so here, here's just a bit more
[1439.70 --> 1443.86]  of a summary here. So he's filed suit against Epic Games, claiming he's in the process of
[1443.86 --> 1448.60]  copywriting the dance. So to be clear, he hasn't already copyrighted it. Um, it's widely,
[1448.60 --> 1453.68]  and this is, this is a quote. It is widely recognized that Mr. Ribeiro's likeness and intellectual
[1453.68 --> 1457.98]  property have been misappropriated by Epic Games and the most popular video game currently in
[1457.98 --> 1462.88]  the world. Fortnite. There's also plenty of games that have this dance. Epic has earned
[1462.88 --> 1466.84]  record profits, profits off of downloadable content in the game, including emotes like
[1466.84 --> 1472.74]  Fresh. Okay. So they're selling it, which I guess is a bit more of a gray area. Yeah.
[1472.92 --> 1477.28]  Um, yet Epic has failed to compensate or even ask permission from Mr. Ribeiro for the use of
[1477.28 --> 1481.40]  his likeness and iconic intellectual property. Someone said he improvised the dance. That's why
[1481.40 --> 1487.86]  he's claiming it. If you improvise something on a show you are paid to act on, that does not
[1487.86 --> 1493.46]  at all mean you just get it. Guess who owns a catchphrase that Luke says on the WAN show?
[1497.90 --> 1502.96]  That's just how it works. Yeah. He has a contract that says that. Yeah. Um, in fact,
[1502.96 --> 1509.64]  that's like the whole point. If, if Luke invents something at Floatplane Media Incorporated,
[1509.64 --> 1516.50]  um, now that's like, okay, that's a little bit more complicated, but, but the, the entity that will own
[1516.50 --> 1524.34]  his invention will be Floatplane Media Incorporated. It's in his contract and I'm, it's probably in his
[1524.34 --> 1531.62]  contract. With that said, it was the eighties. Maybe it was a wilder time. Um, but I, I find it very,
[1531.92 --> 1538.76]  very hard to believe. Now, earlier this month, rapper 2Milli launched nearly identical legal action
[1538.76 --> 1544.82]  against the game, claiming the swipe it emote rips off the Millie rock dance he invented. Um, and they
[1544.82 --> 1549.58]  have also filed suits against 2K games for featuring their dance moves as player emotes in that franchise
[1549.58 --> 1557.52]  too. So where exactly is the line here? It's sort of my feedback on this.
[1560.24 --> 1566.22]  I don't know. Because the argument's being made that they're using his likeness, but I would make
[1566.22 --> 1572.56]  the counter argument that a Fortnite character's likeness is really not very close to a real person.
[1572.56 --> 1579.88]  These are very cartoony. And as far as I can tell, um, who the heck was it that tried to,
[1579.92 --> 1582.52]  was it Lindsay Lohan or something that tried to claim that the-
[1582.52 --> 1582.90]  GTA?
[1583.32 --> 1583.56]  Yeah.
[1583.66 --> 1584.58]  Yeah. She lost.
[1584.68 --> 1585.66]  Yeah. She lost.
[1585.84 --> 1592.28]  In, in a hilarious way. The judge was like, that's just like an average, like whatever,
[1592.50 --> 1595.10]  skimpily clad female. Doesn't matter.
[1595.10 --> 1602.46]  Yeah. So I think that, that arguing that this likeness is, arguing the likeness is tough.
[1603.34 --> 1606.16]  Arguing the dance move. Oh man.
[1607.82 --> 1613.64]  Again, I think that's really hard. And like to say that putting your hip in one direction and
[1613.64 --> 1615.16]  swinging your arms in the other.
[1615.34 --> 1615.76]  Yeah.
[1615.76 --> 1623.74]  Is like the most unique thing. I think that's pretty much the whole dance. Like, I don't know.
[1623.88 --> 1625.80]  Like if we do it, does it come after us?
[1626.18 --> 1629.02]  I don't know. And like, he probably got that from somewhere.
[1629.88 --> 1630.90]  Or maybe not.
[1631.48 --> 1632.18]  Or maybe not.
[1632.18 --> 1636.92]  I mean, people do invent dance moves. Like, not every dance move has been done yet.
[1637.06 --> 1637.54]  Is it an invention?
[1637.54 --> 1643.32]  Man. You know, I think this.
[1643.32 --> 1647.22]  He said in interviews that he stole it. Some random person in chat said. I don't know.
[1647.34 --> 1652.00]  But like, the thing is with stuff like dance and music, you have inspirations.
[1652.52 --> 1652.76]  Yes.
[1652.88 --> 1656.30]  Music has samples. It's like a part of making music.
[1656.96 --> 1658.16]  Ice, ice baby.
[1660.72 --> 1661.28]  Like.
[1661.90 --> 1662.40]  It happens.
[1662.40 --> 1670.00]  And a hilarious thing about that particular one is I actually didn't know that that was just a sample.
[1671.52 --> 1672.08]  Really?
[1672.42 --> 1672.68]  Yeah.
[1672.98 --> 1674.84]  I actually didn't know.
[1675.72 --> 1677.60]  Because, who is it?
[1679.12 --> 1680.18]  Oh, man.
[1680.62 --> 1680.90]  What?
[1681.92 --> 1682.60]  Give me a category.
[1682.62 --> 1683.26]  Under Pressure.
[1683.40 --> 1684.30]  Whose song is that?
[1685.40 --> 1686.66]  You wouldn't know.
[1686.80 --> 1686.94]  Queen?
[1687.54 --> 1688.00]  Yeah.
[1688.24 --> 1688.64]  Thank you.
[1689.08 --> 1690.04]  You wouldn't know?
[1690.32 --> 1692.18]  Well, you don't know music.
[1692.80 --> 1693.72]  Yeah, but like.
[1693.80 --> 1695.44]  I don't know your crap music.
[1695.50 --> 1696.30]  I know Queen.
[1696.88 --> 1697.62]  You don't know.
[1697.76 --> 1698.70]  You don't know shows.
[1698.92 --> 1699.84]  You don't know music.
[1700.02 --> 1700.94]  You don't know movies.
[1701.60 --> 1701.96]  Oh.
[1702.40 --> 1704.00]  I don't know shows and I don't know movies.
[1704.08 --> 1704.36]  Okay.
[1704.58 --> 1704.82]  Right.
[1704.94 --> 1706.38]  This is another thing I was going to bring up.
[1706.48 --> 1711.14]  So, another really complicated aspect of copyright law that I have to admit that I don't fully understand.
[1711.32 --> 1713.24]  I wish John was still working out of this office.
[1713.52 --> 1715.36]  He was even here like last week.
[1715.46 --> 1715.64]  Yeah.
[1715.64 --> 1718.24]  Is how exactly it works.
[1718.36 --> 1725.48]  Where the line is between what aspects of a character the actor owns versus the copyright holder.
[1725.86 --> 1730.56]  So, like when Ryan Reynolds, you know, shows up on late night TV as Deadpool.
[1731.04 --> 1731.34]  Hmm.
[1731.34 --> 1734.48]  That's a live appearance.
[1735.02 --> 1740.86]  What is in his contract with respect to how much in character he has to be?
[1741.18 --> 1744.58]  Or how much Ryan Reynolds he is in that moment?
[1744.80 --> 1744.98]  Right.
[1744.98 --> 1747.18]  Where is the line here?
[1747.46 --> 1747.72]  Yeah.
[1748.14 --> 1750.60]  Who invented a particular characteristic?
[1750.76 --> 1765.62]  Because like a really famous example of an actor taking a role and transforming it in a way that was not even really agreed to, at least initially, by the producers and the director, was Samuel L. Jackson's character in Kingsman.
[1765.62 --> 1781.46]  So, he sort of, in interviews, has talked about how the rest of the management on the movie was kind of like, so you want to have a lisp.
[1784.24 --> 1791.10]  And he kind of pushed for it because he really believed that that was an important part of creating this iconic villain.
[1791.20 --> 1792.62]  He did an amazing job.
[1792.70 --> 1792.94]  Oh, yeah.
[1792.94 --> 1794.88]  He was just like...
[1794.88 --> 1795.98]  Both the Kingsman movies are amazing.
[1796.02 --> 1800.50]  One of my favorite movie villains of all time in that movie.
[1800.60 --> 1804.38]  He just did such a great job of crazy maniac.
[1806.26 --> 1812.04]  But in a totally offbeat, kitschy kind of way that just worked perfectly with the movie.
[1812.58 --> 1815.10]  Anyway, that...
[1815.10 --> 1820.88]  Those mannerisms of the character, Samuel L. Jackson came in and invented.
[1821.60 --> 1824.32]  So, if Fortnite were to do...
[1824.32 --> 1825.02]  I don't think it matters.
[1825.02 --> 1834.14]  An emote that, like, kind of mimics his body movements during an iconic scene in that movie and kind of, you know, melts his line, but, like, doesn't say it.
[1834.20 --> 1835.50]  Doesn't take the actual audio.
[1836.14 --> 1836.84]  Who owns that?
[1836.92 --> 1838.82]  Is that Samuel L. Jackson's property?
[1839.00 --> 1840.38]  Is that, I don't know, Universal?
[1840.54 --> 1844.78]  Whoever owns the Kingsman intellectual property?
[1844.98 --> 1845.12]  Yeah.
[1845.12 --> 1854.48]  I think this is going to be a tough one to win because this opens up floodgates on really almost any kind of artistic imitation.
[1855.72 --> 1861.40]  So, you know, I felt like I didn't really have a position until I went off for a little while there.
[1861.54 --> 1866.34]  And now I actually feel like I'm ready to take a position on this one.
[1866.46 --> 1867.94]  I think he's off his rocker.
[1867.94 --> 1871.60]  I think he's probably out of money and this is a desperation move.
[1871.82 --> 1872.22]  Yeah.
[1872.96 --> 1875.20]  I mean, maybe not out of money.
[1876.02 --> 1877.82]  Maybe he actually has lots of money.
[1877.92 --> 1879.94]  Maybe he invested well and...
[1880.64 --> 1881.12]  Wow.
[1881.28 --> 1882.50]  Just subbed on Floatplane.
[1882.64 --> 1883.70]  Holy S-word.
[1883.90 --> 1884.80]  The quality difference.
[1884.96 --> 1886.50]  Much appreciation as a dev myself.
[1886.80 --> 1887.18]  Heck yeah.
[1887.32 --> 1887.92]  Thank you very much.
[1888.16 --> 1888.64]  Yeah, I agree.
[1888.70 --> 1888.98]  It's weird.
[1889.24 --> 1889.80]  I also...
[1889.80 --> 1890.20]  Who knows?
[1890.74 --> 1892.44]  We don't know law very much at all.
[1892.52 --> 1893.08]  No, we don't.
[1893.08 --> 1894.64]  And then also it's American.
[1894.70 --> 1895.06]  Not a lawyer.
[1895.32 --> 1896.96]  So also that...
[1896.96 --> 1897.44]  Also that.
[1897.50 --> 1898.20]  Oh, geez.
[1898.30 --> 1899.12]  Don't know what's happening.
[1899.50 --> 1901.30]  But I think if it's...
[1901.30 --> 1901.44]  Oh, geez.
[1901.44 --> 1902.08]  Oh, geez.
[1902.08 --> 1903.24]  Work done on a project...
[1903.24 --> 1904.32]  Am I allowed to say, oh, geez?
[1904.60 --> 1905.12]  Oh, geez.
[1905.14 --> 1906.54]  Or is that Rick and Morty now?
[1907.14 --> 1907.88]  Like...
[1907.88 --> 1908.12]  Oh.
[1908.24 --> 1909.06]  Is that a catchphrase?
[1909.44 --> 1909.68]  Yeah.
[1911.08 --> 1911.48]  Yeah.
[1911.78 --> 1915.42]  I think that's a bit of a different thing because spoken word versus dance.
[1915.76 --> 1918.30]  But then that's also hard.
[1918.72 --> 1921.32]  Like, it's a very weird section, but I also don't...
[1921.32 --> 1923.88]  By that logic, how could you copyright Let's Get Ready to Rumble then?
[1924.26 --> 1924.72]  That's good.
[1924.80 --> 1925.48]  Ready to rumble.
[1925.56 --> 1926.14]  No, don't do it.
[1928.38 --> 1929.92]  Because that's actually bad, right?
[1929.92 --> 1931.10]  Like, he charges you for that, right?
[1931.10 --> 1931.24]  Yeah.
[1931.66 --> 1933.00]  He will go after you.
[1933.66 --> 1934.02]  Crazy.
[1934.02 --> 1936.52]  Like, full...
[1936.52 --> 1937.02]  Full...
[1937.62 --> 1938.82]  Full D mode.
[1939.40 --> 1939.58]  Okay?
[1939.70 --> 1940.88]  Just going for it.
[1941.18 --> 1941.68]  Because that...
[1941.68 --> 1942.12]  But that...
[1942.12 --> 1945.26]  Wouldn't that also have, like, the way that you say it attached to it?
[1945.94 --> 1946.66]  Um...
[1946.66 --> 1947.32]  Probably.
[1947.56 --> 1947.82]  Maybe.
[1949.02 --> 1949.62]  I don't know.
[1949.64 --> 1950.64]  Oh, geez, Linus.
[1950.64 --> 1951.42]  Oh, geez.
[1951.50 --> 1952.78]  I don't think you were supposed to drop that.
[1952.94 --> 1953.18]  Oh, geez.
[1953.38 --> 1953.60]  You know?
[1953.68 --> 1954.12]  Like, yeah.
[1954.16 --> 1954.84]  I don't know, man.
[1955.10 --> 1955.40]  All right.
[1955.48 --> 1956.04]  Well, why don't we do...
[1956.04 --> 1957.46]  Again, we don't know this stuff.
[1957.54 --> 1957.84]  I don't know.
[1958.00 --> 1961.48]  I don't think he personally has the ability to do this.
[1961.54 --> 1967.10]  I think the copyright holders of Carlton and Fresh Prince would be the ones that would
[1967.10 --> 1967.68]  have to do this.
[1967.80 --> 1969.08]  We'll have to see what happens with that.
[1969.58 --> 1969.64]  Yeah.
[1969.64 --> 1973.14]  A boring company demo is boring.
[1973.14 --> 1980.86]  This was originally posted on the forum by Kunertum, and the original article was from Gizmodo,
[1981.00 --> 1985.28]  and this is pretty disappointing.
[1986.14 --> 1988.60]  Like riding on a dirt road.
[1989.18 --> 1993.56]  First reviews of Elon Musk's underground tunnel are disappointing.
[1993.56 --> 2000.96]  Apparently, they had trouble getting a paving machine down there for some reason, so it
[2000.96 --> 2004.82]  left the surface really bumpy, so it was like driving on a dirt road.
[2004.90 --> 2006.22]  Apparently, one passenger got sick.
[2006.52 --> 2009.22]  The vehicle only accelerated to 80 kilometers an hour.
[2009.22 --> 2012.02]  So that's what, like 50 miles?
[2012.50 --> 2013.78]  40 something high?
[2013.98 --> 2014.92]  It's not great.
[2015.02 --> 2015.88]  Yeah, it's not fast.
[2016.10 --> 2016.34]  Not great.
[2016.44 --> 2017.28]  Oh, yeah.
[2017.58 --> 2022.62]  On Wednesday, Musk tweeted, next step for boring company loop is demonstrating high
[2022.62 --> 2023.72]  throughput at high speed.
[2023.96 --> 2029.92]  Target is 4,000 vehicles per hour at 55 miles per hour, also known as 250 kilometers per hour.
[2030.64 --> 2031.78]  Probably going to need to repave...
[2031.78 --> 2032.02]  Wait, what?
[2032.76 --> 2033.20]  What?
[2033.34 --> 2033.74]  Sorry, what?
[2034.48 --> 2036.54]  250 kilometers an hour?
[2036.72 --> 2036.96]  Yeah.
[2036.96 --> 2039.58]  Oh, at 155 miles per hour.
[2039.66 --> 2040.86]  Sorry, I thought you said 55.
[2041.42 --> 2041.68]  No.
[2043.32 --> 2044.00]  Yeah, okay.
[2044.16 --> 2046.54]  So that is apparently the next goal.
[2047.38 --> 2048.98]  Okay, that's a big...
[2048.98 --> 2049.92]  That is a pretty big bump.
[2050.20 --> 2055.20]  They will definitely have to repave, and also a big note here is that they were using like
[2055.20 --> 2057.02]  Model Xs as vehicles.
[2057.58 --> 2061.18]  In all the demos, they've shown like big buses and like just other types of vehicles.
[2061.98 --> 2065.88]  Apparently, they're saying the bumpers that they have on the inside could be attached to
[2065.88 --> 2069.60]  essentially any autonomous electric vehicle, not just a Tesla.
[2069.92 --> 2070.12]  Sure.
[2070.20 --> 2070.90]  So that's interesting.
[2071.14 --> 2073.78]  So they're not like married to their other company, which makes sense.
[2074.20 --> 2074.38]  Sure.
[2075.64 --> 2077.10]  But yeah, I don't know.
[2077.24 --> 2078.02]  I'm not surprised.
[2078.14 --> 2078.96]  It was kind of disappointing.
[2079.44 --> 2085.50]  I think they probably shouldn't have demoed it yet, or they should have demoed it with the
[2085.50 --> 2086.18]  right expectations.
[2086.18 --> 2088.72]  If this is the state they were at, they must have known.
[2088.86 --> 2090.84]  They didn't make it go 250 kilometers an hour.
[2091.00 --> 2094.34]  They must have known they were only going to go 80, and it was going to feel very much
[2094.34 --> 2096.34]  like driving at 80 on a road.
[2096.36 --> 2097.08]  I'm sure they tried it.
[2097.26 --> 2097.50]  Yeah.
[2097.64 --> 2098.74]  Like, I don't know.
[2098.90 --> 2103.22]  I think maybe they could have communicated that a little bit better or just not done a
[2103.22 --> 2103.68]  test yet.
[2103.80 --> 2103.94]  Yeah.
[2104.00 --> 2105.64]  Setting expectations is sort of key.
[2106.16 --> 2106.42]  Yeah.
[2106.56 --> 2108.48]  So I think that's probably where they missed the mark here.
[2108.72 --> 2109.68]  What is a T-pose?
[2110.82 --> 2111.18]  You just...
[2112.06 --> 2112.44]  You just...
[2112.44 --> 2112.90]  Oh, oh.
[2113.00 --> 2113.42]  We got to be...
[2113.42 --> 2113.70]  Yeah.
[2114.32 --> 2116.78]  But you're supposed to be standing, hence the T-part.
[2116.94 --> 2117.20]  Oh.
[2117.38 --> 2119.48]  Someone wants me to T-pose for five seconds.
[2122.22 --> 2123.32]  But you're supposed to...
[2123.32 --> 2123.46]  Oh.
[2123.86 --> 2124.70]  Yeah, you have to stand.
[2124.78 --> 2125.70]  So you'll be out of frame.
[2125.82 --> 2127.28]  That's just not going to work very well.
[2127.38 --> 2127.54]  Oh.
[2127.66 --> 2129.62]  Yeah, that's going to be a problem.
[2130.42 --> 2130.62]  Yeah.
[2130.62 --> 2131.74]  So you can't see the other...
[2131.74 --> 2132.08]  You know what?
[2132.14 --> 2133.30]  There you go, Niguard.
[2133.82 --> 2134.86]  It was worth a shot.
[2137.96 --> 2138.28]  Okay.
[2138.50 --> 2140.36]  Oh, we should do our sponsors for the show today.
[2141.06 --> 2141.38]  FreshBooks.
[2141.38 --> 2146.62]  FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing solution that lets you, as a small business

[2221.10 --> 2221.60]  That's okay.
[2221.96 --> 2222.40]  Lame.
[2223.18 --> 2223.66]  Kidding.
[2223.84 --> 2225.26]  And private internet access.
[2225.96 --> 2226.24]  PIA.
[2226.56 --> 2226.98]  It's good.
[2227.12 --> 2227.74]  Go check it out.
[2227.88 --> 2228.22]  Do it.
[2228.22 --> 2231.76]  Yeah, we're on like an affiliate basis with these guys, so I don't actually have to do
[2231.76 --> 2232.50]  any talking points.
[2232.72 --> 2233.72]  It's the best sponsors.
[2233.84 --> 2234.28]  PIA.
[2235.08 --> 2236.44]  Also known as PIA.
[2236.92 --> 2237.32]  PIA.
[2237.46 --> 2237.62]  PIA.
[2238.00 --> 2238.24]  PIA.
[2238.24 --> 2238.32]  PIA.
[2238.32 --> 2238.44]  PIA.
[2238.44 --> 2238.84]  PIA.
[2238.84 --> 2238.92]  PIA.
[2238.92 --> 2239.76]  The competition.
[2240.04 --> 2240.18]  PIA.
[2240.18 --> 2240.20]  PIA.
[2240.20 --> 2240.70]  PIA.
[2240.70 --> 2240.80]  PIA.
[2240.80 --> 2241.20]  PIA.
[2241.20 --> 2241.30]  PIA.
[2241.30 --> 2241.34]  PIA.
[2241.34 --> 2241.40]  PIA.
[2241.40 --> 2241.46]  PIA.
[2241.46 --> 2241.50]  PIA.
[2241.50 --> 2241.60]  PIA.
[2241.60 --> 2242.00]  PIA.
[2242.00 --> 2242.10]  PIA.
[2242.10 --> 2242.50]  PIA.
[2242.50 --> 2242.60]  PIA.
[2242.60 --> 2242.70]  PIA.
[2242.70 --> 2243.04]  PIA.
[2243.04 --> 2243.10]  PIA.
[2243.10 --> 2243.60]  PIA.
[2243.60 --> 2244.10]  PIA.
[2244.10 --> 2244.60]  PIA.
[2244.60 --> 2245.60]  PIA.
[2245.60 --> 2246.10]  PIA.
[2246.10 --> 2246.60]  PIA.
[2246.60 --> 2247.10]  PIA.
[2247.10 --> 2247.60]  PIA.
[2247.60 --> 2248.60]  PIA.
[2248.60 --> 2249.10]  PIA.
[2249.10 --> 2252.48]  I feel like they'd be more of a defensive character.
[2252.48 --> 2252.98]  PIA.
[2252.98 --> 2253.48]  PIA.
[2253.48 --> 2254.70]  Maybe those are all reactionary shots?
[2254.70 --> 2255.64]  Attacks of opportunity?
[2255.64 --> 2256.64]  Jake, what's up?
[2256.64 --> 2257.14]  Oh!
[2257.14 --> 2257.64]  Oh!
[2257.64 --> 2258.14]  Oh!
[2258.14 --> 2258.64]  Rude.
[2258.64 --> 2259.64]  That was a...
[2259.64 --> 2260.14]  What?
[2260.14 --> 2261.14]  You love PIA.
[2261.14 --> 2262.14]  Why would you kill it?
[2262.14 --> 2263.14]  I like PIA.
[2263.14 --> 2263.64]  Yeah.
[2263.64 --> 2264.14]  It's pretty good.
[2264.14 --> 2264.64]  Yeah.
[2264.64 --> 2265.64]  PIA's good stuff.
[2265.64 --> 2267.14]  So go to LMG...
[2267.14 --> 2268.36]  Oh, that link.
[2268.36 --> 2269.36]  This link sucks.
[2269.36 --> 2273.36]  Go to lmg.gg forward slash PIA wan.
[2273.36 --> 2274.36]  Yay!
[2274.36 --> 2275.36]  Yeah.
[2275.36 --> 2276.36]  We made one of those.
[2276.36 --> 2278.12]  We really need to upgrade this graphic.
[2278.12 --> 2280.60]  Yes, we do.
[2280.60 --> 2283.12]  Speaking of upgrades, um...
[2283.12 --> 2286.12]  Nvidia is downgrading...
[2286.12 --> 2287.12]  Squarespace.
[2287.12 --> 2288.12]  Their RTX...
[2288.12 --> 2289.12]  What about it?
[2289.12 --> 2290.12]  I already did it.
[2290.12 --> 2291.12]  You did Squarespace and...
[2291.12 --> 2292.12]  You didn't even notice?
[2292.12 --> 2293.12]  I was reading...
[2293.12 --> 2296.12]  Wow, that is a whole other level of tuning out.
[2296.12 --> 2297.12]  I was reading Floatplane Chat.
[2297.12 --> 2299.12]  That is actually amazing.
[2299.12 --> 2301.12]  There was important things happening at Floatplane Chat.
[2301.12 --> 2306.12]  I did an entire sponsor read and you didn't hear it at all.
[2306.12 --> 2307.88]  Do you ever listen?
[2307.88 --> 2308.88]  Sometimes.
[2308.88 --> 2309.88]  I'm actually curious.
[2309.88 --> 2310.88]  I very selectively tune in.
[2310.88 --> 2314.88]  When we're on the show, are you listening to my half?
[2314.88 --> 2315.88]  Yes, yes, yes.
[2315.88 --> 2316.88]  Yes.
[2316.88 --> 2317.88]  Because sometimes I tune out of yours.
[2317.88 --> 2318.88]  I don't blame you.
[2318.88 --> 2320.88]  That's a little rude, but that's okay.
[2320.88 --> 2321.88]  That's hilarious.
[2321.88 --> 2322.88]  Okay.
[2322.88 --> 2327.88]  So let's talk about Nvidia's new GTX 1100 series.
[2327.88 --> 2331.88]  I couldn't figure out why they skipped a bunch of numbers.
[2331.88 --> 2332.88]  Now I get it.
[2332.88 --> 2333.88]  Do you?
[2333.88 --> 2335.64]  Do I get it now?
[2335.64 --> 2336.64]  Yeah.
[2336.64 --> 2337.64]  Yeah.
[2337.64 --> 2338.64]  Why?
[2338.64 --> 2339.64]  So here's what they're doing.
[2339.64 --> 2340.64]  Okay.
[2340.64 --> 2342.64]  Nvidia, I mean, they're not stupid.
[2342.64 --> 2343.64]  Hmm.
[2343.64 --> 2345.64]  Do you think they're stupid?
[2345.64 --> 2347.64]  I mean, collectively, no.
[2347.64 --> 2348.64]  Okay.
[2348.64 --> 2349.64]  Okay.
[2349.64 --> 2350.64]  Okay.
[2350.64 --> 2353.90]  So I don't think Nvidia is stupid.
[2353.90 --> 2361.40]  And so when I was looking at it going like, okay, so we got this RTX thing.
[2361.40 --> 2368.08]  Clearly, the hardware you're shipping now, especially anything that isn't the top of the line, is not
[2368.08 --> 2378.84]  powerful enough to do anything other than these first gen, and I'm going to call them experiences, because obviously this is going to get better over time.
[2378.84 --> 2379.34]  Yeah.
[2379.34 --> 2389.16]  Like five, ten years from now, real time ray tracing in this manner or another one could be an absolutely fundamental aspect of game design.
[2389.58 --> 2390.00]  Who knows?
[2390.68 --> 2393.88]  But right now, these are experiences.
[2393.88 --> 2402.54]  So anything other than their highest N1 is not going to run anything other than these first gen experiences at anything resembling a playable frame rate.
[2403.74 --> 2404.14]  Period.
[2404.30 --> 2404.90]  It's not going to happen.
[2405.18 --> 2413.70]  So like a game that comes out in 2020 with RTX is not going to run the RTX-ness well on a current gen card.
[2413.80 --> 2414.50]  In 2020.
[2415.22 --> 2416.38]  2020, 2021.
[2416.66 --> 2417.94]  Actually, 2020 is pretty close.
[2418.02 --> 2418.14]  Okay.
[2418.14 --> 2418.92]  Let's say 2021.
[2419.54 --> 2422.82]  It's because like it could be three years before they release a follow up.
[2422.88 --> 2423.24]  I don't know.
[2423.24 --> 2424.04]  The way things are going.
[2425.46 --> 2425.98]  So.
[2426.32 --> 2427.86]  That's kind of true, actually.
[2428.00 --> 2432.56]  So there's actual dedicated silicon in the chip for RTX.
[2433.02 --> 2433.18]  Yeah.
[2433.22 --> 2436.84]  But they know that this feature doesn't add value for a lot of their customers.
[2437.26 --> 2441.78]  So I was looking at it going, okay, they went straight from 10 to 20.
[2442.24 --> 2445.50]  They've got this feature that costs them real money.
[2445.94 --> 2449.36]  Actually costs them money that they actually have to charge you for.
[2449.64 --> 2451.58]  I mean, they don't have to, but they're not a charity.
[2451.58 --> 2454.06]  Um, so it actually costs you money.
[2454.06 --> 2458.96]  And for a lot of people doesn't deliver tangible value.
[2458.96 --> 2463.60]  Especially as you come down from the upper tier of cards into the lower ones.
[2463.92 --> 2465.66]  So this makes sense now.
[2466.50 --> 2470.72]  Rumors are circulating that NVIDIA is set to launch, this is posted by Robin M on the forum,
[2471.34 --> 2480.08]  a GeForce RTX 2060 and a GT and a GTX 1160 in mid-January.
[2480.08 --> 2482.46]  Some say it will actually be an 1160 Ti.
[2482.72 --> 2486.54]  So these new cards would be Turing GPUs, but different variants.
[2486.64 --> 2488.20]  So there will be a TU-106.
[2488.32 --> 2489.16]  That's the 2060.
[2489.40 --> 2491.46]  And a TU-116.
[2491.84 --> 2493.56]  And that is the GTX.
[2493.70 --> 2496.16]  So that's with all the RTX features cut out.
[2496.40 --> 2502.76]  So it would have the Turing shaders instead of ray tracing, which will remain exclusive to RTX models.
[2502.76 --> 2511.14]  There is rumored to be no RTX 2050, which would mean that these mid-range and entry-level parts would be GeForce 11 only.
[2511.34 --> 2512.76]  So I would fully...
[2513.42 --> 2514.02]  Okay, no.
[2514.22 --> 2514.84]  What do you think?
[2515.22 --> 2517.68]  So will they go as far as then?
[2517.98 --> 2519.44]  So will they keep them segmented?
[2519.68 --> 2520.30]  If you want...
[2520.30 --> 2521.80]  If you're a high-end gamer, whatever.
[2522.02 --> 2522.70]  You pay for RTX.
[2522.82 --> 2526.80]  You want that ray tracing stuff in your Battlefield V and other games, theoretically, at some point.
[2526.80 --> 2531.60]  And then if you're a low-end gamer, well, honestly, the hardware wasn't going to run it anyway.
[2531.76 --> 2532.36]  So get rekt.
[2532.44 --> 2533.48]  You can just not run RTX.
[2533.84 --> 2533.94]  Yeah.
[2534.12 --> 2542.24]  Or do you think that they will actually offer a value-performance GTX option like an 1180 or something like that?
[2542.40 --> 2543.58]  I don't think they're going to.
[2544.14 --> 2546.36]  And I really wish they did this whole thing differently.
[2546.68 --> 2546.96]  Both.
[2547.10 --> 2547.72]  I will say both.
[2547.80 --> 2548.04]  Okay.
[2548.14 --> 2549.96]  I would like to hear both of these stories.
[2550.08 --> 2552.28]  So I don't think they're going to go back up, necessarily.
[2553.00 --> 2553.56]  No, I'm just kidding.
[2553.62 --> 2554.06]  I am listening.
[2554.40 --> 2554.76]  Wow.
[2555.18 --> 2556.06]  It was a sponsor spot.
[2556.06 --> 2557.40]  I was dealing with a flow plane problem.
[2558.44 --> 2564.94]  So I don't think they're going to go back up, for one, because I do think they want to keep their high-end prices.
[2565.06 --> 2565.32]  Sorry.
[2565.48 --> 2566.08]  I'm listening.
[2566.48 --> 2570.38]  I do think they want to keep their high-end prices as, like, one kind of product.
[2570.50 --> 2572.10]  They want to have their one premier product.
[2572.36 --> 2576.74]  You don't want to have, like, oh, you don't like ray tracing, which we want to focus on, but you want a maximum experience.
[2576.76 --> 2581.76]  So we can have, like, RTX and, like, GTX and, like, I don't know, LTX, like, Lite.
[2582.18 --> 2583.64]  Lite TX or something.
[2583.96 --> 2584.92]  Oh, no, I wasn't even thinking.
[2585.12 --> 2585.74]  Oh, right.
[2586.06 --> 2586.50]  Oh.
[2588.44 --> 2588.76]  Oh.
[2589.18 --> 2590.10]  Don't let me forget.
[2590.24 --> 2590.84]  We have more news about that.
[2590.84 --> 2591.64]  We have big LTX news.
[2591.80 --> 2591.86]  Yeah.
[2591.86 --> 2591.88]  Yeah.
[2591.88 --> 2592.06]  Okay.
[2592.16 --> 2592.38]  Go ahead.
[2592.44 --> 2592.98]  No, I'm on it.
[2592.98 --> 2600.06]  I think what they should have done is kept the 2000-whatever because people don't like number variants.
[2600.30 --> 2601.74]  That gets people really confused.
[2601.96 --> 2602.14]  Sure.
[2602.16 --> 2602.66]  And that's okay.
[2602.94 --> 2605.90]  I think they just, as you get on the stack, should have switched to GTX.
[2607.16 --> 2607.84]  Oh, okay.
[2607.84 --> 2609.52]  Interesting.
[2609.52 --> 2609.56]  Interesting.
[2609.56 --> 2611.36]  But then what if they wanted...
[2611.36 --> 2611.98]  Or, like, TTX.
[2611.98 --> 2617.00]  What if they wanted to have, like, 1160 and 2060?
[2617.42 --> 2622.38]  Like, where they're both a 60 variant, but just with and without a feature.
[2623.12 --> 2626.52]  Because suffixes used to be a thing.
[2626.52 --> 2627.86]  Like, what about a suffix?
[2628.22 --> 2628.80]  Or that.
[2628.96 --> 2629.14]  Yeah.
[2629.52 --> 2632.88]  Like, I hate that it's RTX now.
[2632.94 --> 2634.80]  I've screwed that up a handful of times already.
[2634.90 --> 2636.96]  But you could have a GTX 2060.
[2636.96 --> 2637.48]  2080R.
[2637.52 --> 2640.72]  And you could have a RTX 2060.
[2640.72 --> 2644.60]  You could have two 2060s and just have GTX RTX.
[2644.70 --> 2645.78]  See, I hate the suffix.
[2645.88 --> 2646.82]  Or I hate the prefix.
[2647.24 --> 2649.24]  I'd rather have a suffix, personally.
[2649.40 --> 2649.64]  Okay.
[2649.88 --> 2652.16]  But we both agree no number change.
[2652.72 --> 2653.04]  Yes.
[2653.42 --> 2655.60]  I would have preferred if it was just all 1160s.
[2655.60 --> 2656.48]  I'm fine with a suffix.
[2656.48 --> 2657.86]  I don't actually care which one.
[2657.94 --> 2658.98]  I'm down with a suffix.
[2659.24 --> 2659.66]  Like...
[2659.66 --> 2661.22]  I just don't want...
[2661.22 --> 2662.48]  I don't like the number change.
[2662.48 --> 2667.48]  The cynic in me feels like this was a meeting where they sat around thinking,
[2667.70 --> 2670.20]  how do we make this sound like a huge quantum leap forward?
[2670.72 --> 2671.28]  I know.
[2671.64 --> 2672.80]  Let's go up by...
[2672.80 --> 2674.10]  Let's ramp the first number up.
[2674.16 --> 2675.98]  10,000 rather than 1,000.
[2676.08 --> 2676.70]  Or excuse me.
[2676.82 --> 2678.18]  1,000 rather than 100.
[2678.40 --> 2678.60]  Yeah.
[2678.88 --> 2681.46]  Like, honestly, that's what it sounds like to me.
[2681.64 --> 2681.88]  Yeah.
[2683.48 --> 2684.70]  Great, great...
[2684.70 --> 2685.14]  That's silly.
[2685.24 --> 2686.68]  Great post on the float plane chat.
[2687.02 --> 2689.76]  Rayati says, I can almost count Luke's beard hairs.
[2691.14 --> 2691.46]  So...
[2691.46 --> 2692.96]  You got a trim, did you not?
[2693.12 --> 2693.42]  Yeah.
[2694.80 --> 2696.08]  How was that for you?
[2696.34 --> 2696.54]  Okay.
[2696.64 --> 2699.98]  So, if you guys didn't notice, my hair and beard were a little ridiculous for a while.
[2699.98 --> 2701.48]  But you still kind of look ragged.
[2701.52 --> 2701.96]  I know.
[2702.54 --> 2703.60]  Which is the whole problem.
[2705.54 --> 2709.14]  So, did you go to, like, the place next to the pho restaurant?
[2709.30 --> 2709.56]  Okay.
[2709.62 --> 2712.72]  So, there's a place I've been going to get my hair cut for actually years.
[2712.84 --> 2713.06]  Yeah.
[2713.06 --> 2714.94]  And we don't understand each other at all.
[2715.16 --> 2715.62]  I started...
[2715.62 --> 2719.56]  I went and I showed them a picture of Captain America in Captain America Winter Soldier.
[2719.90 --> 2720.76]  And I was like, that.
[2721.48 --> 2722.64]  And then they just did it.
[2723.12 --> 2724.10]  And it was great.
[2724.18 --> 2725.24]  And it always looked great.
[2725.32 --> 2727.56]  And then every time it would be a new lady, I would just show her the same...
[2727.56 --> 2729.86]  I would Google the same picture and just show her the same picture again.
[2730.08 --> 2731.54]  It was always, like, slightly different.
[2731.66 --> 2734.00]  But it was more or less great.
[2734.66 --> 2736.66]  And then I grew it out for a really long time.
[2736.74 --> 2737.92]  So, I wanted it to be slightly longer.
[2737.96 --> 2739.14]  And I wanted to have a slightly longer beard.
[2739.62 --> 2744.00]  And I went to this really fancy, bougie kind of place.
[2744.72 --> 2745.12]  Bougie.
[2745.36 --> 2748.04]  And spent way more money than I was comfortable with.
[2748.22 --> 2750.88]  And got, like, a beard trim and a nice haircut.
[2751.48 --> 2756.56]  And the whole time I was sitting there, I was like, I don't think this is going to be better at all.
[2757.06 --> 2762.66]  And then I left and, like, got home and kind of looked at it closely and was like, I kind of look the same.
[2763.62 --> 2766.78]  Just, like, ever so minorly cleaned up.
[2766.90 --> 2769.04]  So, I'm probably going back to the ladies that I can't understand.
[2769.04 --> 2770.60]  So, my hair looks like crap.
[2770.82 --> 2772.14]  But it cost me, like, $11.
[2772.86 --> 2774.70]  See, that's what my old haircut used to cost.
[2774.84 --> 2775.72]  So, I'm going back there.
[2775.80 --> 2775.94]  Yeah.
[2776.22 --> 2778.92]  Actually, mine was particularly bad the last one.
[2779.32 --> 2780.58]  So, guys, if you look.
[2780.96 --> 2783.76]  So, I just got my haircut, I think, last weekend or something like that.
[2783.82 --> 2784.78]  Or Monday or something.
[2784.92 --> 2785.28]  Whatever.
[2785.38 --> 2785.74]  It doesn't matter.
[2786.18 --> 2794.90]  The point is, if you look at some of the most recent live stuff in particular, you'll probably be able to tell that this side was, like, noticeably longer.
[2795.08 --> 2797.58]  Like, almost twice as long as this side up around the top.
[2797.66 --> 2801.38]  And then I got the same hairdresser at The Great Clips when I went in just recently.
[2801.60 --> 2803.34]  And she did the same thing.
[2803.82 --> 2805.80]  So, I hate to be that guy.
[2806.02 --> 2807.28]  I really hate it.
[2807.40 --> 2807.44]  Me too.
[2807.44 --> 2808.84]  But I was like, she was like, yeah.
[2808.92 --> 2809.72]  So, she pulls out the mirror.
[2809.82 --> 2812.60]  I'm like, hold on a minute with the mirror there for a sec.
[2813.20 --> 2816.26]  Can we, can we, and I didn't say it like this.
[2816.34 --> 2820.30]  But, like, can we have a look at how this side is, like.
[2820.46 --> 2824.38]  And there's this excuse about how it, like, grows different ways on either side of my head.
[2824.42 --> 2824.86]  And I'm like.
[2825.40 --> 2825.78]  Don't care.
[2825.78 --> 2829.40]  So, here's the fundamentals of how scissors work.
[2830.18 --> 2831.40]  You take your fingers.
[2831.74 --> 2832.88]  You go like this.
[2832.98 --> 2835.54]  You pull it up straight away from the scalp.
[2835.76 --> 2837.06]  And you slice it off.
[2837.42 --> 2838.66]  You just didn't do it.
[2839.42 --> 2843.68]  It had nothing to do with the direction my hair was growing.
[2843.76 --> 2844.88]  So, here's how your job works.
[2844.88 --> 2847.58]  It's like, I'm gonna let you finish, but.
[2847.62 --> 2847.96]  Oof.
[2848.22 --> 2850.00]  If I say that, can Kanye come after me?
[2850.12 --> 2850.26]  Like.
[2850.32 --> 2850.70]  Oh, maybe.
[2851.26 --> 2851.78]  Who knows.
[2851.90 --> 2853.60]  Is being an asshole trademarkable?
[2856.60 --> 2858.04]  Cartman just has everything.
[2858.04 --> 2864.12]  You know, I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone would actually be cool about it, though.
[2864.22 --> 2864.62]  Probably.
[2865.14 --> 2869.46]  Have they ever gone after anyone for, like, memeing their jokes?
[2869.98 --> 2871.98]  I have never heard of that happening.
[2872.48 --> 2872.74]  Me neither.
[2872.74 --> 2873.60]  And I'm not surprised.
[2873.84 --> 2875.56]  It doesn't seem like a them thing.
[2876.64 --> 2881.92]  I'm sure if you, like, tried to make basically exactly one of their episodes, they would probably get cheesed.
[2881.96 --> 2883.32]  Yeah, they'd be pretty annoyed.
[2883.58 --> 2887.44]  But they'd be more likely to lampoon you on an episode.
[2887.68 --> 2887.90]  Yeah.
[2889.04 --> 2889.76]  I think.
[2889.80 --> 2890.62]  They don't have original ideas.
[2892.74 --> 2897.00]  So, let's do the iPad Pros topic because it's sort of the title.
[2897.10 --> 2902.48]  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't bother because Ed's giving me a ride home and he just, like, popped his head over here to see if we were done.
[2903.24 --> 2905.20]  This was posted by Street Guru on the forum.
[2905.30 --> 2911.62]  Apple has confirmed that some of their 2018 iPad Pros are shipping with a very slight bend in the aluminum chassis.
[2911.70 --> 2912.92]  That's an interesting wording for it.
[2912.92 --> 2922.72]  According to the company, this is a side effect of the device's manufacturing process and shouldn't worsen over time or negatively affect the flagship iPad's performance in any practical way.
[2922.84 --> 2925.52]  Apple does not consider it to be a defect.
[2925.52 --> 2925.96]  Sweet.
[2925.96 --> 2926.08]  Sweet.
[2926.08 --> 2926.16]  Sweet.
[2926.16 --> 2934.18]  The bend is a result of a cooling process involving the iPad Pros metal and plastic components.
[2934.18 --> 2942.02]  Both sides of the device can be affected and it seems to be more pronounced on the LTE model as there's a plastic strip that breaks up the iPad's flat aluminum sides.
[2942.02 --> 2947.84]  Some people have mentioned that the text on the full plane chat is a little bit small and hard to see if you have eye problems.
[2949.04 --> 2950.40]  Not a defect.
[2951.78 --> 2952.50]  Yeah.
[2952.94 --> 2958.54]  It's a side effect of the text rendering process.
[2958.68 --> 2958.86]  Yeah.
[2959.12 --> 2966.66]  As it's going from your keyboard to your browser and to other people's browsers, it may get smaller.
[2966.90 --> 2971.06]  It's just a part of our advanced manufacturing process.
[2971.06 --> 2972.82]  In all seriousness, though, that's great feedback.
[2972.96 --> 2973.28]  Thank you.
[2973.40 --> 2973.92]  Yeah, thank you.
[2974.18 --> 2974.96]  We'll work on that.
[2975.44 --> 2985.96]  So Apple says it has not seen a higher than normal return rate so far, but the only way for affected customers to return their iPads now that they've noticed that it's bent is within the 14-day return window.
[2986.10 --> 2992.52]  So it should be no problem to just buy six iPads, check for the flattest one, and return the other five, but we're not saying you should do that.
[2994.36 --> 2996.12]  We're not saying you should buy an iPad at all.
[2996.12 --> 3001.58]  Oh, yeah, because you could literally – you don't even have to just rapidly exchange.
[3001.80 --> 3003.24]  You could literally just buy a ton of them.
[3003.44 --> 3003.60]  Yeah.
[3003.76 --> 3004.86]  And then just – no, no, no, no, no.
[3004.98 --> 3012.58]  I mean, that's one of the reasons that electronics retailers can't take, like, open box processor returns without charging restocking fees.
[3012.58 --> 3019.80]  Because back in the day when overclocking was, like, kind of more of a thing, people would go and they would buy, like, 20, 30 processors.
[3020.04 --> 3022.38]  They would overclock them all, see which one could do it.
[3022.78 --> 3023.46]  Also bin checking.
[3023.50 --> 3024.86]  And then they'd keep really good ones.
[3025.06 --> 3032.44]  They would flip them on eBay or whatever, and then they'd just return the craptastic ones with open boxes and heat's, like, thermal compound all over them.
[3032.44 --> 3032.72]  Okay.
[3033.44 --> 3033.88]  Okay.
[3034.42 --> 3035.96]  So the last thing for today.
[3037.02 --> 3039.52]  I'm going to ltxexpo.com.
[3039.66 --> 3040.70]  We know it's redundant.
[3041.22 --> 3042.02]  We don't care.
[3042.68 --> 3044.88]  And I'm going to the updates page.
[3045.18 --> 3046.16]  Do you like the logo, by the way?
[3046.88 --> 3047.10]  Yeah.
[3047.48 --> 3048.02]  No, it's sharp.
[3048.10 --> 3048.60]  I like it a lot.
[3048.94 --> 3050.82]  Oh, do you like this logo being on the same page?
[3051.56 --> 3053.84]  Probably more than anyone could imagine.
[3055.26 --> 3057.04]  I'm actually so freaking excited.
[3057.56 --> 3058.26]  Oh, my God.
[3058.26 --> 3061.16]  You guys should sign up if you want to get this news, or you can just watch WAN Show because realistically –
[3061.16 --> 3062.02]  We'll talk about it every time.
[3062.02 --> 3062.52]  We're going to be talking about it.
[3063.58 --> 3064.40]  Explore Vancouver.
[3064.76 --> 3068.26]  Sterf posted an update on the blog, so we understand that – oh, wait.
[3068.30 --> 3068.96]  Do you have to click it?
[3069.06 --> 3070.58]  Oh, that's not actually that obvious.
[3071.00 --> 3071.62]  Oh, wow.
[3071.78 --> 3073.28]  There's work to be done on the blog.
[3073.36 --> 3073.78]  Oh, okay.
[3073.98 --> 3074.18]  Okay.
[3074.70 --> 3081.30]  So as part of our weekly plan, so we want to make sure that there's an update every week from now on.
[3081.48 --> 3081.58]  Nice.
[3081.58 --> 3081.80]  Something.
[3081.80 --> 3082.02]  I like it.
[3082.50 --> 3083.20]  So this time –
[3083.20 --> 3084.84]  Some booth being added, something going on.
[3084.84 --> 3088.00]  We don't really have anything huge to share on the blog.
[3088.00 --> 3096.14]  So because it's a two-day event this time, because Vancouver during the summer happens to just be a beautiful place to come and visit,
[3096.64 --> 3102.32]  and we know that it's hard to justify coming all the way out here just for a convention or something like that,
[3102.64 --> 3108.70]  we just wanted to post some fun and cool stuff to do here in the city that you guys can check out while you're here.
[3108.80 --> 3111.52]  Like, don't just make it a two-day in-and-out event.
[3111.80 --> 3112.58]  Come see our city.
[3112.74 --> 3113.44]  Come enjoy it.
[3113.48 --> 3113.92]  Stay for a bit.
[3113.92 --> 3115.82]  This is the Capilano Suspension Bridge.
[3116.00 --> 3118.98]  It's actually a really, like – it's a little bit hard to capture.
[3119.22 --> 3120.48]  It's a really wonderful experience.
[3120.50 --> 3121.22]  It's pretty sick.
[3122.98 --> 3123.30]  Sorry?
[3123.52 --> 3124.32]  I went there last week.
[3124.54 --> 3125.08]  Oh, did you really?
[3125.22 --> 3125.40]  Yeah.
[3125.40 --> 3125.66]  Oh, cool.
[3126.76 --> 3128.18]  Granville Island is a lot of fun.
[3128.42 --> 3132.54]  If you enjoy craft beers, Vancouver is a happening scene for that kind of thing.
[3132.54 --> 3137.82]  If you want to make a night of it and you go to Granville Island, you can go to a thing called Vancouver Theater Sports.
[3137.82 --> 3145.06]  That's where Ryan Stiles and one of the other awesome dudes off of Whose Line Is It Anyways?
[3145.06 --> 3145.60]  Colin Mockery.
[3145.66 --> 3146.94]  Colin Mockery got their start.
[3147.06 --> 3147.52]  Really awesome.
[3147.86 --> 3148.04]  Yep.
[3148.56 --> 3150.10]  So really, really cool stuff.
[3150.34 --> 3155.42]  And also, over on the LTX Twitter, this is cool.
[3155.52 --> 3157.10]  This is an actual update.
[3157.44 --> 3157.98]  Oh, yeah.
[3158.12 --> 3158.30]  Okay.
[3158.42 --> 3159.60]  This is amazing.
[3159.60 --> 3163.96]  This is our convention space this year.
[3164.70 --> 3167.82]  It is flipping huge.
[3168.00 --> 3171.94]  You moved it off slightly, but it's like 75,000 – no, the size.
[3172.28 --> 3172.48]  Oh.
[3173.14 --> 3173.86]  Oh, yeah.
[3174.12 --> 3175.54]  75,000 square feet.
[3175.68 --> 3175.90]  Yeah.
[3176.06 --> 3177.58]  75,000 square feet, baby.
[3177.82 --> 3180.20]  It is going to be something else.
[3180.34 --> 3188.00]  We are hard at work making sure that this year's event is going to be a huge step up.
[3188.00 --> 3190.10]  We have already talked to Bob and Rod.
[3190.52 --> 3190.80]  Nice.
[3190.90 --> 3197.80]  Nothing is like set in stone, but we have penciled in a way bigger booth for them.
[3197.86 --> 3198.18]  Nice.
[3198.44 --> 3202.34]  And they are going to do some kind of cool activation with respect to like water cooling
[3202.34 --> 3204.20]  or PC modding or something like that.
[3204.60 --> 3205.46]  We are working with them.
[3205.80 --> 3208.60]  We have a crazy project.
[3209.26 --> 3213.70]  So at the last two, you were able to try 16K Gaming and 10K Gaming.
[3214.08 --> 3215.26]  We had them there at the show.
[3215.72 --> 3217.64]  This year, it is going to be something really different.
[3217.64 --> 3219.14]  It is going to be something way cooler.
[3219.76 --> 3220.08]  Ooh.
[3220.42 --> 3220.58]  Yeah.
[3220.60 --> 3221.84]  I will tell you more about it off stream.
[3221.92 --> 3222.12]  Okay.
[3222.52 --> 3223.78]  It is going to be like sick.
[3223.98 --> 3225.28]  I am assuming we can get it working.
[3225.38 --> 3226.48]  We should be able to get it working.
[3226.52 --> 3231.32]  I love how every time so far, there has always been like some crazy plan that we like hope
[3231.32 --> 3232.16]  we can get working.
[3232.60 --> 3235.98]  And then like up until the very night of, it is like not working.
[3236.20 --> 3238.60]  Like our negative two, it finally comes together.
[3240.50 --> 3242.56]  But it makes it every time.
[3242.74 --> 3242.92]  Yeah.
[3243.04 --> 3243.40]  Somehow.
[3243.60 --> 3244.90]  Somehow we keep pulling it off.
[3244.94 --> 3245.46]  So good.
[3245.46 --> 3248.32]  So I want to do a couple of super chats here.
[3249.68 --> 3251.12]  MAPE keeps sending money.
[3251.32 --> 3252.10]  Hype for LTX.
[3252.12 --> 3252.70]  He is going to be there.
[3253.28 --> 3253.74]  MAPE is coming?
[3254.00 --> 3254.28]  Yeah.
[3254.46 --> 3254.78]  Heck yeah.
[3254.84 --> 3255.80]  So him saying he is hyped.
[3255.92 --> 3259.84]  He got plane tickets for Christmas or something.
[3259.98 --> 3261.04]  I don't remember the exact details.
[3261.32 --> 3261.94]  Heck yeah.
[3262.28 --> 3262.90]  See you there, MAPE.
[3263.90 --> 3264.54]  Oh boy.
[3264.64 --> 3266.94]  Tommy Gunn says, bring Channel Super Fun back.
[3266.94 --> 3271.66]  Jensen says, Merry Christmas.
[3271.94 --> 3272.34]  Hi Jensen.
[3272.44 --> 3273.28]  Merry Christmas to you too.
[3273.62 --> 3274.20]  Hey Mufu.
[3274.54 --> 3275.40]  Hey Demon Sonic.
[3276.04 --> 3279.38]  Oh, sign up before January 31st.
[3279.46 --> 3279.66]  Yeah.
[3280.30 --> 3280.56]  Okay.
[3281.24 --> 3284.90]  Would you be willing to add Sargon of a CAD to float plane?
[3285.24 --> 3286.34]  What is that?
[3286.34 --> 3287.56]  It's a YouTuber.
[3287.96 --> 3288.76]  Political dude.
[3288.86 --> 3289.66]  Political dude.
[3289.78 --> 3290.36]  Right winger.
[3290.62 --> 3291.94]  Well, I don't think he's right wing.
[3292.52 --> 3292.92]  So.
[3293.16 --> 3294.24]  We don't actually care.
[3294.24 --> 3300.24]  So our policy with respect to right wing, left wing politics is as long as what you're
[3300.24 --> 3302.84]  doing isn't illegal, then it's really none of our business.
[3303.58 --> 3304.06]  Yeah.
[3305.78 --> 3307.28]  Dan says, have a good night.
[3307.42 --> 3308.46]  I'll catch up in the morning.
[3308.58 --> 3309.16]  Too late.
[3309.94 --> 3310.52]  Thanks, Dan.
[3311.70 --> 3312.54]  Infinite power.
[3312.54 --> 3314.46]  Why on earth is float plane using Firebase?
[3314.46 --> 3316.36]  Hey, why not?
[3318.52 --> 3321.58]  Like actually though, I'm interested.
[3321.74 --> 3326.48]  He says, please consider using a bundler to bundle all the assets on float plane.
[3326.56 --> 3327.76]  It'll improve your load speed a lot.
[3327.98 --> 3328.12]  Yeah.
[3328.98 --> 3329.28]  Okay.
[3329.40 --> 3330.48]  So that's something we know.
[3330.48 --> 3330.68]  That's a thing.
[3330.86 --> 3331.02]  Okay.
[3332.16 --> 3335.32]  Other side guy, turn the Lamborghini into an insane track day car.
[3336.02 --> 3336.52]  Oh boy.
[3336.78 --> 3341.16]  We also have plans for like, like ways to use the bundler that will be better and blah,
[3341.16 --> 3341.72]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3341.72 --> 3344.44]  We wanted to turn the Lamborghini into a rally car.
[3345.02 --> 3345.34]  Yeah.
[3345.34 --> 3347.26]  That was something we wanted to do with it.
[3347.40 --> 3350.16]  We actually had a sponsor mostly lined up.
[3350.26 --> 3352.72]  They ended up, we ended up still doing something with them.
[3352.80 --> 3353.90]  It was way less cool.
[3354.24 --> 3358.62]  Frankly, I'm not going to name any names because like they're a partner and like, I'm not trying
[3358.62 --> 3361.34]  to like crap on them or anything, but they made the wrong call.
[3361.58 --> 3362.30]  I know AJ.
[3362.48 --> 3362.64]  Don't worry.
[3363.88 --> 3365.22]  What else we got here?
[3366.28 --> 3368.64]  Oh, Rediff float plane cast button.
[3369.64 --> 3371.28]  Is that like easy or hard?
[3371.52 --> 3372.34]  Pretty sure it's already a thing.
[3373.04 --> 3375.20]  Oh, well, um, what about on live stream though?
[3375.74 --> 3377.00]  Oh, uh.
[3377.00 --> 3378.64]  So that's, yeah, it's definitely not here.
[3379.06 --> 3380.14]  Casting from your laptop?
[3380.84 --> 3381.14]  Yeah.
[3381.16 --> 3381.82]  How would that work?
[3382.00 --> 3383.30]  I'm pretty sure it's there on a phone.
[3383.38 --> 3384.62]  I don't know about a live stream though.
[3384.80 --> 3386.84]  I know, I know VODs has a casting button.
[3386.98 --> 3388.94]  I don't know if live stream has a casting button.
[3389.18 --> 3389.48]  Okay.
[3389.54 --> 3389.74]  Sorry.
[3389.74 --> 3392.56]  Um, any thoughts of making it is apparently it is.
[3392.64 --> 3393.02]  Yeah.
[3393.12 --> 3394.92]  Any thoughts of making an app for Android?
[3395.20 --> 3397.04]  Also looking great from Japan.
[3397.16 --> 3401.80]  Someone sent a super chat through YouTube, but they're watching on float plane.
[3401.88 --> 3402.32]  Heck yeah.
[3402.86 --> 3405.18]  An app is definitely on our radar.
[3405.30 --> 3410.26]  We'd have to be complete idiots to not have thought of, you know, we should, should we
[3410.26 --> 3410.88]  have an app?
[3410.88 --> 3417.20]  The problem for us is that really the, the hard work of what we're doing is on the backend,
[3417.80 --> 3425.32]  building out a scalable platform for delivering VODs and live streams that is not based on
[3425.32 --> 3426.24]  AWS.
[3426.80 --> 3431.18]  So doesn't have the cost boat anchor that comes along with that is not easy.
[3431.18 --> 3436.18]  There are like container apps where we just like containerize the website and it's just
[3436.18 --> 3437.70]  like on the desktop of your phone.
[3437.88 --> 3440.22]  But like anyone can do that at any time.
[3440.22 --> 3444.50]  It's not really, we do want a dedicated app at some point, which will run faster and
[3444.50 --> 3446.50]  be better and whatnot, but not now.
[3446.86 --> 3448.12]  Thanks trade three 33.
[3448.40 --> 3449.24]  Oh, Holy crap.
[3449.30 --> 3451.32]  The whole thing is like blowing up right now.
[3451.78 --> 3454.24]  Disney is currently being sued for Hakuna Matata.
[3454.34 --> 3455.26]  Are you serious right now?
[3456.62 --> 3457.66]  That's amazing.
[3458.32 --> 3458.58]  Oh yeah.
[3458.78 --> 3459.50]  Is that even real?
[3459.54 --> 3463.12]  There's like four or five Fortnite dances that people are suing over.
[3463.26 --> 3463.50]  Yeah.
[3463.68 --> 3464.82]  Oh, the floss one.
[3464.90 --> 3465.48]  The floss one.
[3465.54 --> 3466.64]  They're being sued over that one too.
[3466.64 --> 3468.82]  There's like some teenage kid who apparently did it in a video.
[3468.82 --> 3469.22]  Yeah.
[3469.26 --> 3472.30]  I know about the kid who like went viral with it and whatever.
[3472.98 --> 3473.30]  So yeah.
[3473.60 --> 3475.02]  He's apparently suing as well.
[3475.68 --> 3476.00]  Nice.
[3476.36 --> 3479.38]  It's just everybody wants a piece of the hundred million dollar a month or whatever.
[3479.50 --> 3479.82]  Sure.
[3480.18 --> 3480.94]  Why not?
[3481.74 --> 3486.46]  Nearly 45,000 people signed a petition accusing Disney of colonialism and robbery for trademarking
[3486.46 --> 3489.44]  the Swahili phrase Hakuna Matata made famous in the Lion King.
[3490.16 --> 3491.46]  Oh, they trademarked it.
[3492.12 --> 3494.92]  Is it tipping point in Disney's portrayal of Africa?
[3495.24 --> 3497.16]  Is it cultural appropriation petition claims?
[3497.22 --> 3498.58]  That doesn't sound like an actual lawsuit.
[3498.70 --> 3499.24]  That's a petition.
[3500.18 --> 3500.58]  Okay.
[3500.76 --> 3501.86]  Enlightened Apple fanboy.
[3501.94 --> 3503.08]  When do we get to meet Janice?
[3503.70 --> 3504.10]  Okay.
[3504.10 --> 3506.78]  So we are going to do a meet this.
[3507.56 --> 3510.12]  So we do these exclusive videos for float playing.
[3510.12 --> 3510.50]  Way to go.
[3510.66 --> 3511.16]  Or meet the team.
[3511.52 --> 3516.00]  Next time Janice is in and not busy, I will sit her down and do the interview style thing.
[3516.00 --> 3519.58]  So I guess late January probably.
[3520.30 --> 3521.02]  Not now.
[3521.20 --> 3523.80]  This guy whose name contains characters I don't know how to pronounce.
[3523.80 --> 3527.86]  My issue is some person's dance moving game would be fine if it was free, but Epic charges
[3527.86 --> 3529.42]  money for something they didn't invent.
[3529.90 --> 3530.96]  That is sketchy.
[3531.42 --> 3534.36]  I think this is going to be pretty tough to enforce though.
[3534.80 --> 3536.24]  Why don't you guys do 90 minute shows anymore?
[3536.30 --> 3538.02]  Because we never get started at 430.
[3538.10 --> 3540.84]  That's still when we try and we're just always like today we were later.
[3540.98 --> 3542.04]  And there's way less news now.
[3543.20 --> 3543.60]  Yeah.
[3543.78 --> 3544.96]  This show's about news anyway.
[3545.32 --> 3545.88]  That's true.
[3547.02 --> 3550.52]  Someone posted on, will you be reviewing the OnePlus 7 next year?
[3550.58 --> 3550.96]  Presumably.
[3550.96 --> 3551.06]  Presumably.
[3552.60 --> 3554.34]  And then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3555.12 --> 3555.48]  Oh yeah.
[3555.58 --> 3555.70]  Okay.
[3555.84 --> 3556.14]  Okay.
[3556.24 --> 3557.38]  So there was one thing on float.
[3557.38 --> 3559.44]  One float playing comment that I wanted to address.
[3560.36 --> 3561.32]  I don't know.
[3561.42 --> 3562.40]  Did I highlight it or something?
[3562.60 --> 3563.28]  Oh, I don't remember.
[3563.48 --> 3563.76]  Too late.
[3563.88 --> 3564.20]  All right.
[3565.10 --> 3567.50]  I've seen a few and I, yeah, I know.
[3567.64 --> 3568.32]  I'll leave this off.
[3568.48 --> 3569.50]  Did you guys talk about the store?
[3571.20 --> 3571.66]  Didn't we?
[3571.70 --> 3572.26]  I think so.
[3572.38 --> 3573.10]  We talked about the store?
[3573.22 --> 3574.10]  We can talk about the store again.
[3574.20 --> 3574.30]  Yeah.
[3574.34 --> 3575.94]  Some people did ask about my shirt.
[3576.12 --> 3576.30]  Yeah.
[3576.70 --> 3579.22]  This is, this is a.
[3579.86 --> 3580.94]  Yeah, we did talk about the store.
[3580.94 --> 3581.66]  It's an LTT shirt.
[3582.52 --> 3584.16]  It is officially an LTT shirt.
[3584.50 --> 3588.40]  You can get it on the website along with other LTT shirts that look great.
[3588.54 --> 3588.84]  Woo.
[3589.12 --> 3590.60]  I like this one a lot, actually.
[3590.70 --> 3591.62]  This is very cool.
[3592.04 --> 3595.70]  So one, one thing that's cool about this shirt is I know some people, myself included,
[3595.70 --> 3598.72]  don't always want like super hardcore branding on things.
[3598.72 --> 3603.18]  So with this shirt, you can support the channel and buy a shirt that just looks really cool
[3603.18 --> 3603.70]  on its own.
[3604.06 --> 3608.64]  And this part at least has, it has a little LTT in it, but it's just like dots within the
[3608.64 --> 3609.24]  constellations.
[3609.44 --> 3610.98]  And there's lots of other dots too.
[3611.16 --> 3612.26]  Want to see a fun Easter egg?
[3612.56 --> 3612.86]  Sure.
[3612.86 --> 3614.58]  Look at my pupils.
[3617.08 --> 3617.60]  Whoa.
[3618.28 --> 3619.80]  Either I'm high as a kite.
[3619.84 --> 3620.78]  How high are you?
[3620.92 --> 3626.04]  Or, or I had an eye doctor appointment that morning.
[3626.42 --> 3626.94]  Oh.
[3626.94 --> 3634.30]  I was trying so hard to not, like every time Brandon had to snap a shot of me during this
[3634.30 --> 3637.10]  shoot, I was like, okay, I'm ready.
[3638.24 --> 3638.68]  Oh.
[3639.12 --> 3640.04]  Oh, my eyes.
[3640.90 --> 3641.32]  What was that?
[3641.32 --> 3643.84]  Because I was just, I was, they had to put drops in to dilate me.
[3644.26 --> 3644.70]  Oh.
[3646.16 --> 3646.52]  Yeah.
[3646.52 --> 3646.60]  Yeah.
[3646.60 --> 3648.10]  You look super stoned.
[3648.12 --> 3649.62]  I had to go in for an eye scan.
[3651.24 --> 3651.64]  Wow.
[3652.02 --> 3652.92]  That's amazing.
[3653.02 --> 3653.56]  So that's a fun.
[3653.56 --> 3654.14]  Have people noticed?
[3654.24 --> 3655.22]  Do you just point that out for fun?
[3655.22 --> 3658.46]  No, Ivan pointed it out when I was shooting a video with him earlier.
[3658.88 --> 3661.28]  He's like, yo, you look blazed as hell, dude.
[3662.76 --> 3663.28]  That's weird.
[3663.42 --> 3663.72]  Man.
[3664.38 --> 3664.74]  Man.
[3665.20 --> 3670.22]  But yeah, whether you want like the classic logo t-shirt or one that's just called constellations.
[3670.46 --> 3672.40]  Do we have a zoom in on this so people can actually see it?
[3672.60 --> 3674.32]  Yeah, we should, we should show it.
[3674.44 --> 3674.88]  There it is.
[3675.38 --> 3675.66]  There.
[3675.76 --> 3678.54]  So you can see there's like little lines drawn between the constellations.
[3678.78 --> 3681.48]  And if you're really paying attention, you can notice an LTT.
[3682.50 --> 3682.86]  There we go.
[3682.90 --> 3683.58]  You don't have to pay attention.
[3683.68 --> 3684.56]  I can point it out for you.
[3684.68 --> 3684.94]  There.
[3685.22 --> 3685.46]  There.
[3685.46 --> 3686.98]  If you haven't seen it yet, it's very subtle.
[3687.06 --> 3691.50]  So if you want a really subtle way to support and have a cool, really comfortable, nice quality
[3691.50 --> 3692.76]  t-shirt, you can go with that.
[3692.86 --> 3696.96]  Or you can go with one of the more like clearly, hey guys, I like Linus Tech Tips shirts.
[3698.10 --> 3698.72]  Cable ties.
[3698.94 --> 3699.76]  Cable ties.
[3701.30 --> 3703.00]  Wait, do we have Ashley just fully?
[3703.40 --> 3704.04]  Oh, okay.
[3704.10 --> 3705.24]  They put them on orange cables.
[3705.60 --> 3706.66]  That actually looks really sharp.
[3707.12 --> 3707.38]  Yep.
[3707.38 --> 3707.92]  All right.
[3707.92 --> 3709.68]  All right.
[3709.76 --> 3711.66]  So that's it for the WAN show for this week.
[3711.98 --> 3712.72]  And the other question.
[3712.82 --> 3712.96]  Oh.
[3713.32 --> 3716.04]  Do you want to release that super duper long thing tonight?
[3716.74 --> 3717.66]  The super duper long thing?
[3717.66 --> 3717.88]  Oh.
[3717.88 --> 3718.64]  Is it ready to go?
[3718.76 --> 3719.98]  That would kind of make sense.
[3719.98 --> 3721.72]  This is the weekend before.
[3722.04 --> 3722.86]  Do you want to announce it?
[3723.74 --> 3724.14]  Yeah.
[3724.64 --> 3724.88]  Yeah.
[3724.88 --> 3725.18]  Sure.
[3725.28 --> 3725.62]  Why not?
[3725.94 --> 3726.34]  Okay.
[3726.34 --> 3728.64]  So we've done something really special.
[3728.78 --> 3732.64]  This was a James initiative for the most part.
[3732.76 --> 3737.78]  Like he was really championing this project hardcore, but he got a lot of help.
[3738.76 --> 3745.64]  Brandon, my understanding is sat out there with him for literally hours working on this project.
[3746.72 --> 3748.26]  Oh, I'm on the wrong server right now.
[3748.32 --> 3748.80]  Give me a second.
[3748.90 --> 3751.36]  I'm just going to see if I can play some of it off the server here.
[3753.52 --> 3755.60]  Ed actually also gave him a lot of help.
[3755.60 --> 3763.68]  A lot of people on the team pitched in to try and help get this thing exported because basically he had a goal.
[3764.06 --> 3770.10]  He had a dream to create the world's first 8K ULog.
[3772.14 --> 3773.84]  Is it actually the world's first?
[3773.98 --> 3778.20]  I have no idea, but it's really good.
[3778.72 --> 3779.98]  It's actually pretty cool.
[3780.20 --> 3782.38]  A very early 8K ULog.
[3782.38 --> 3789.32]  So there's a bit of an issue here, and that is that a lot of the files here are very broken.
[3789.70 --> 3792.24]  So I'm hoping there's one that I can actually play.
[3792.76 --> 3797.66]  There are also a lot of them very, very high bit rate, and I think my poor laptop is going to cry.
[3799.12 --> 3799.54]  Oh, wow.
[3799.54 --> 3805.08]  But it is very, very ULog.
[3805.62 --> 3806.62]  Where is this?
[3806.62 --> 3806.90]  Very LTT.
[3808.46 --> 3809.44]  Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[3809.56 --> 3813.40]  And it's anywhere from, how long is the, we wanted to do 10 hours.
[3813.74 --> 3817.26]  We wanted to do a 10 hour 8K ULog.
[3817.26 --> 3821.70]  And I think we've dialed it back to, I'm not, I'm not sure.
[3821.72 --> 3823.26]  There's some like Easter eggs in there.
[3823.38 --> 3823.96]  Tech Easter eggs.
[3823.96 --> 3824.22]  Yep.
[3824.22 --> 3825.40]  There's fun Easter eggs.
[3825.66 --> 3829.96]  You can hear his laptop's like, the fans are spinning up and it's lagging a little bit.
[3830.06 --> 3830.78]  And this is great.
[3831.44 --> 3832.52]  Um, yeah.
[3833.02 --> 3833.22]  Yeah.
[3833.22 --> 3836.36]  My laptop is, is feeling the burn right now here.
[3836.46 --> 3837.08]  Oh my goodness.
[3837.20 --> 3837.92]  Let's have a look here.
[3837.92 --> 3838.70]  The Cast Manager can't even open.
[3839.14 --> 3839.56]  Yeah.
[3839.56 --> 3841.02]  CPU is slammed.
[3841.50 --> 3843.96]  GPU is, GPU is hurting.
[3844.20 --> 3844.94]  Oh my goodness.
[3845.02 --> 3845.22]  Yeah.
[3845.44 --> 3847.48]  I have 11 gigs of RAM in use.
[3847.76 --> 3852.66]  And all I'm doing is, well, I do have Chrome tabs open, but, uh, I'm just watching a video.
[3853.08 --> 3854.70]  People are asking how large the file is.
[3854.82 --> 3858.68]  Uh, well the, so the 10 hour file was over a terabyte.
[3861.48 --> 3862.84]  That was ProRes though.
[3864.20 --> 3869.46]  So we, we've run into like all kinds of issues, like export issues, stability.
[3869.56 --> 3871.62]  Issues, YouTube file limit issues.
[3871.72 --> 3873.90]  We didn't know they had a file size limit, but they do.
[3874.44 --> 3875.86]  Um, what is it?
[3876.14 --> 3877.62]  It's 125 gigabytes.
[3877.82 --> 3878.08]  Okay.
[3878.26 --> 3878.50]  Yeah.
[3879.28 --> 3880.50]  So there you go.
[3880.64 --> 3883.56]  Now, you know, we now have float planes, new file size limit.
[3885.08 --> 3885.66]  All right.
[3885.86 --> 3887.22]  So thanks guys for tuning in.
[3887.30 --> 3888.10]  See you again next week.
[3888.18 --> 3889.68]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3889.80 --> 3891.06]  I think the Yule log is coming tonight.
[3892.34 --> 3892.70]  Bye.
[3892.70 --> 3892.78]  Stop.
