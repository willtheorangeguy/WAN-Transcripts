[0.00 → 0.72] Okay.
[1.70 → 2.10] Okay.
[2.94 → 4.72] Oh, did they remove the no nooks on Twitch rule?
[4.72 → 6.14] There's no way they removed that rule.
[6.68 → 7.28] You think so?
[7.38 → 8.32] I would not risk it.
[9.04 → 9.72] I doubt it.
[10.24 → 15.00] Either way, I just have to get my super professional shirt on here.
[15.00 → 15.50] Thank you.
[15.92 → 16.36] Saved.
[16.36 → 17.02] There we go.
[17.10 → 17.48] Oh, yeah.
[17.72 → 18.44] RTX on.
[18.52 → 20.96] You don't want to stand up and show everyone how that works.
[21.26 → 23.30] Twitter hates this shirt.
[23.52 → 24.04] Oh, yeah.
[24.20 → 26.64] They're like, why would I buy that?
[26.64 → 31.90] And I heard through the grapevine that some people at NVIDIA have seen it already.
[32.20 → 32.46] Yeah.
[32.76 → 39.58] And they're like, so was he saying that like RTX makes him hard or that like RTX can suck it?
[39.90 → 42.34] And I'm just like, neither of those things?
[43.72 → 45.06] That's not even the meme.
[45.34 → 47.14] It's when you've got a big ray to trace.
[47.46 → 48.16] You need ray tracing.
[48.40 → 48.74] Right?
[48.94 → 49.20] Yeah.
[49.44 → 52.68] I mean, it's a lie, but I'm going to wear the shirt anyway.
[54.34 → 55.18] Oh, boy.
[55.18 → 57.28] Oh, this week.
[57.74 → 59.00] That's been a good week.
[59.10 → 63.56] As long as you're not NVIDIA hoping to keep RTX 20.
[63.90 → 65.00] Actually, no, never mind.
[65.30 → 68.32] Well, what can I say?
[70.12 → 72.48] Partway through, I was like, why is he stuttering on this?
[72.54 → 74.16] And then I realized that maybe there's.
[74.32 → 75.94] So there is a good chance.
[76.28 → 76.60] Okay.
[76.60 → 86.78] That reviews of the RTX graphics cards when they come, because we know everyone has them, right?
[86.86 → 88.38] Because unboxing went up today.
[89.06 → 89.16] Yeah.
[89.16 → 95.54] So I could extrapolate from that probably reviews are coming at some point.
[95.68 → 96.32] Do we have one?
[96.84 → 97.16] Yes.
[97.30 → 97.60] Okay.
[97.98 → 98.14] Yeah.
[98.94 → 103.56] We did an unboxing today of a network switch and my new router.
[103.56 → 107.38] With RTX boxes in the background.
[107.82 → 108.18] Nice.
[108.34 → 108.50] Okay.
[108.60 → 109.28] Pure Lulu.
[109.38 → 109.78] That's awesome.
[109.78 → 110.12] Pure Lulu.
[110.16 → 110.54] That's great.
[110.62 → 114.18] So people, like, the comments are full of, like, I thought it would be the iPhone XS.
[114.44 → 116.20] I thought it would be RTX graphics cards.
[116.98 → 117.36] Nope.
[118.08 → 118.40] Neither.
[118.40 → 118.52] Neither.
[119.12 → 120.46] It's what I wanted to do.
[121.88 → 123.20] So, okay.
[123.36 → 124.44] So we know everyone has cards.
[125.52 → 133.68] And we know that usually reviews come, you know, I don't know, a week or so after unboxing start to go up.
[133.82 → 133.88] Yeah.
[134.00 → 134.98] That's generally how that works.
[134.98 → 135.76] A week or two.
[137.20 → 138.94] Especially when they embargo everything.
[138.94 → 149.58] What we don't know is what, if anything, with RTX in it could possibly be included in a review in that time frame.
[151.50 → 152.22] No, no, no.
[152.22 → 156.86] These are all things that, okay, so there's, okay, we'll get into it more later.
[157.02 → 161.32] But I'm just, I'm just saying gear up for disappointment.
[163.94 → 167.50] I mean, there's one good game in that list.
[167.50 → 169.14] It's not about good games or bad games.
[169.24 → 171.18] It's about having it.
[171.28 → 171.88] How is it under the rest?
[172.04 → 172.52] Having it.
[172.56 → 173.32] Do you have this?
[173.88 → 174.36] Which one?
[174.80 → 176.12] Hell blade Senna's Sacrifice.
[177.18 → 177.62] Okay.
[177.88 → 180.12] But is the feature enabled?
[180.44 → 180.80] Oh, no.
[180.80 → 184.90] Because we also have Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which doesn't have the patch.
[185.12 → 185.32] Yeah.
[186.30 → 187.06] And PUBG.
[187.38 → 187.54] Okay.
[187.76 → 189.32] Love how PUBG is under the rest.
[190.20 → 190.70] Oh, okay.
[190.82 → 192.02] Newly added in the rest.
[192.22 → 192.34] I get it.
[192.34 → 192.78] Oh, okay.
[192.86 → 193.08] All right.
[193.14 → 193.32] All right.
[193.80 → 194.24] Anyway.
[194.40 → 194.80] Anyway.
[195.00 → 196.06] Topics for this week.
[196.06 → 201.44] NVIDIA has revealed some performance of the RTX series, but like.
[201.76 → 202.28] One question.
[202.34 → 202.66] One question.
[202.74 → 202.88] Yeah.
[202.88 → 204.78] Have you tried RTX?
[205.20 → 205.44] No.
[205.76 → 206.36] I haven't tried it yet.
[206.36 → 206.38] I have.
[207.38 → 208.08] You know what?
[208.24 → 212.28] Save that for after the intro, because I don't want people, you know, leaving the video yet.
[212.34 → 212.60] Okay.
[212.84 → 216.64] Because that's like, as soon as people see it, because that's the title of the video is it's
[216.64 → 218.04] something about RTX performance.
[218.12 → 219.78] As soon as people get that, they're just going to leave.
[219.92 → 220.24] Okay.
[220.24 → 221.10] They're going to leave us.
[221.44 → 222.64] And we're going to be sad.
[222.64 → 223.64] That does.
[223.74 → 224.66] That would make me sad.
[225.30 → 227.50] Um, actually, I just, I just, you know what?
[227.60 → 228.04] Screw it.
[228.06 → 230.34] We'll talk about it now, but you have to watch the intro first.
[233.44 → 235.52] We didn't even announce any other topics.
[235.62 → 235.90] No.
[237.40 → 238.38] Does any of them matter?
[238.50 → 239.60] It's all RTX right now.
[240.06 → 240.86] Everything's RTX.
[240.86 → 241.04] Yeah.
[242.70 → 243.48] Oh, crap.
[243.66 → 244.10] Night box.
[244.10 → 259.06] Watch it.
[259.06 → 261.56] Oh, Word?
[262.04 → 262.38] Uh-oh.
[262.66 → 263.42] I'm in trouble now.
[263.78 → 264.48] Oh, boy.
[264.52 → 265.48] Colton's going to yell at me.
[266.26 → 269.92] You know, he has gotten pretty big for his britches.
[269.98 → 272.26] He, like, gets mad at me when I do stuff wrong now.
[272.26 → 275.24] Do you remember how timid he was?
[275.58 → 275.72] Yes.
[277.84 → 279.02] Very much so.
[279.78 → 281.62] Like, I would.
[281.82 → 286.34] If you told me back then that he would eventually do that, part of me would be like, it's Colton.
[286.42 → 287.02] I could see it.
[287.10 → 288.50] But at the same time, no.
[289.10 → 289.30] No.
[289.40 → 294.40] He was like, oh, apparently the intro volume is bunged up for some reason.
[294.54 → 295.86] I have no idea why that is.
[295.98 → 296.90] But I blame Jake.
[297.64 → 298.16] Yeah, me too.
[298.96 → 301.34] Anyway, the what was I talking about?
[301.34 → 308.58] Yeah, Colton, when he first started, I'd be like, hey, Colton, would you mind maybe please do something?
[308.68 → 310.94] Be like, oh, okay.
[311.16 → 311.90] I'm sorry.
[313.16 → 315.60] Whereas now he's like, yeah, you're done.
[315.68 → 316.56] You're done screwed that up.
[316.66 → 317.98] But, you know, don't worry.
[318.02 → 318.50] I'll fix it.
[318.64 → 320.94] You know, he's like, he's all like business.
[321.04 → 321.60] It's crazy.
[321.94 → 322.26] Laser focus.
[322.36 → 324.02] Anyway, I forget why I was talking about Colton.
[324.02 → 324.30] Right.
[324.42 → 324.66] Yeah.
[324.66 → 327.98] Because he's going to give me crap if I say the sponsor's name wrong.
[328.74 → 333.54] Anyway, why don't we jump right into, tell me.
[334.84 → 338.92] So you were at, I guess, was it, oh my goodness, it's September.
[339.04 → 339.74] You were at PAX then.
[339.82 → 340.14] I was at PAX.
[340.14 → 340.34] Yeah.
[340.60 → 341.42] So you tried RTX.
[341.70 → 341.86] Yeah.
[341.86 → 341.96] Okay.
[342.06 → 342.86] There was an all right.
[343.06 → 351.78] There was an so how much of your life would you want to look back on and not have had RTX in it?
[351.78 → 352.22] Yeah.
[355.02 → 355.42] Yeah.
[355.52 → 362.14] I don't, I don't, I understand this is the meme, but I don't, I don't remember exactly how Steve replied to the meme.
[362.22 → 364.08] So I can't do like the proper meme response.
[364.26 → 364.38] Yeah.
[365.14 → 367.88] But yeah, no, it was, I mean, it was cool.
[368.70 → 372.16] I had some, some bigger and other takeaways though.
[372.32 → 377.30] I asked, I was very specific about what I was able to talk about from the invite only event.
[378.74 → 379.14] Okay.
[379.14 → 381.80] And I'm not allowed to say what game it was.
[384.04 → 389.28] And I can't say whether it's on the list of games that we have here, but I can talk about the experience.
[389.28 → 390.84] I just can't talk about what game it was.
[391.06 → 396.54] I think the reason for that was, um, actually, no, I don't even want to go into that.
[396.66 → 401.04] Because I don't want to allude to, to what game it was, but yeah, I can talk about how good it was.
[401.04 → 403.34] They're being so cagey about this stuff.
[403.34 → 405.96] They are being very cagey, but I was able, yeah, I was able to use.
[406.02 → 408.10] Frame rate limiters on demos.
[408.10 → 411.48] I have an interesting idea as to why that might be.
[411.66 → 411.76] Okay.
[411.86 → 412.16] All right.
[412.16 → 412.38] All right.
[412.38 → 413.58] We'll get into that next then.
[413.66 → 415.62] Looks like this is going to be the RTX show.
[415.76 → 418.50] So are we going into another topic or do I just keep on?
[418.50 → 418.72] No, no.
[418.82 → 418.96] Okay.
[419.02 → 419.34] Hit me.
[419.46 → 419.72] Hit me.
[419.76 → 423.00] So they had a cool feature where you could just tap, I think it was F1.
[423.14 → 423.34] Yeah.
[423.48 → 426.72] And it would rapidly switch between RTX on and RTX off.
[426.72 → 427.02] Sure.
[427.02 → 432.20] Like there was like no lag, no switching between it at all.
[432.58 → 434.76] Um, and there was no frame rate difference.
[434.76 → 443.06] And I think that was the reason why they limited was because they didn't want to show you the difference in performance.
[443.06 → 451.86] Even if there was a very minor difference in performance, if there was some amount, it would skew the conversation away from what RTX looked like.
[452.12 → 454.68] And they wanted the conversation to be about what it looked like.
[454.96 → 455.44] Sure.
[455.44 → 457.94] Now the second part was how good did it look?
[458.36 → 458.70] Yes.
[459.68 → 464.96] I can't tell you what game it was, which would be super helpful for explaining how good it looked.
[465.18 → 468.16] But I'll give you the vague, definitely not enough information.
[468.56 → 469.70] It looked very good.
[471.16 → 474.06] Which is useless because you don't know what game it was.
[474.06 → 474.34] That's not it.
[474.40 → 474.86] You know what?
[474.90 → 476.10] And I can't tell you much about it.
[476.12 → 478.06] You know what? I want Riley back on the LAN show instead.
[478.72 → 480.10] I want Riley back.
[480.24 → 482.24] He's going to review the RTX 2080.
[483.78 → 484.80] Do you know about this?
[484.80 → 485.76] Do you know about this controversy?
[485.94 → 486.56] Yes, no, I do know about this.
[486.62 → 486.78] Yeah.
[486.88 → 487.82] I saw that while I was going to.
[487.82 → 488.40] That was nuts.
[488.52 → 489.74] People freaked out way too hardcore.
[490.04 → 493.66] I watched it and was like, I don't understand what people have said about it.
[493.66 → 495.64] Riley watched it and was like, I don't understand.
[496.40 → 500.48] So the thing is that people were like, Linus, you made a joke, and it didn't land.
[501.08 → 504.22] But I think what they're missing is that Riley was the one who made the joke.
[504.68 → 506.52] And it was an inside joke to me.
[506.64 → 506.88] Yeah.
[506.96 → 509.26] And I made an inside joke back to him.
[509.36 → 509.98] And it was fine.
[510.12 → 512.92] And it didn't really matter if it landed with you guys.
[512.92 → 516.30] Not everything on the LAN show is necessarily about.
[516.86 → 517.12] Okay.
[517.74 → 518.62] Like it is.
[518.70 → 519.92] It's obviously it's a show.
[520.06 → 520.84] It's right in there.
[520.94 → 521.28] It's show.
[522.06 → 526.44] But to keep some banter going, some inside stuff is going to be said because you're just
[526.44 → 527.38] in the flow of things.
[527.60 → 527.94] Okay.
[528.06 → 529.30] Here's the big thing here though.
[530.02 → 532.78] RTX off looked horrible.
[534.16 → 535.12] And I can't tell you.
[535.12 → 540.44] So are we back to the whole stupid HDR on and off again thing?
[540.80 → 541.00] Like.
[541.48 → 541.92] No.
[542.56 → 543.32] This is where.
[543.42 → 543.56] Okay.
[543.68 → 544.86] So my theory is.
[545.00 → 550.26] We're like the games looked intentionally destroyed with HDR off.
[550.40 → 552.12] This is where I think it's different.
[552.40 → 553.64] This is all theory crafting.
[553.64 → 555.56] I couldn't get any answers out of them, obviously.
[556.14 → 558.54] But in the pitch that happened before.
[558.70 → 558.96] Yeah.
[559.06 → 559.84] We saw the game.
[559.98 → 562.84] A big part that they brought up was that enabling RTX.
[563.00 → 565.56] Putting RTX into your game is super easy.
[567.86 → 569.22] This is really important.
[569.66 → 571.40] It takes very little time.
[571.56 → 572.74] It takes very little work.
[573.00 → 573.44] Okay.
[573.92 → 574.74] So basically.
[574.74 → 575.62] You see where it's going.
[575.62 → 581.96] Whatever game this is has just garbage town lighting because that's hard.
[582.74 → 587.02] And it has good lighting with RTX because RTX is easy.
[587.44 → 588.72] Is that what we're saying?
[588.72 → 589.72] So it looks like.
[590.46 → 590.62] Oh.
[590.88 → 592.30] But part of the problem is.
[592.52 → 593.28] You're killing me here.
[593.40 → 594.78] I can't say what game it was.
[594.94 → 595.32] Yeah.
[596.10 → 597.96] But either people that have.
[599.14 → 599.70] Maybe.
[600.16 → 601.48] Maybe I will say.
[601.48 → 606.74] That something along the lines of that game that has existed in the past.
[606.82 → 611.04] Whether it was a previous version or it was the same development house, or it was something.
[611.22 → 611.40] I don't.
[611.48 → 611.66] I'm not.
[611.78 → 612.70] I can't get too specific.
[613.34 → 614.88] The lighting was perfect.
[615.34 → 615.78] Okay.
[615.88 → 617.16] Like notably perfect.
[617.46 → 617.94] Okay.
[618.10 → 619.90] And it looked like trash.
[620.80 → 621.28] So.
[621.44 → 623.32] So I think the thing that's happening us.
[623.40 → 623.80] Yeah.
[624.28 → 624.94] I don't know.
[624.94 → 626.34] This is all super unconfirmed.
[626.58 → 626.72] Yeah.
[626.82 → 627.04] Sure.
[627.04 → 628.26] I think the thing that's happening us.
[628.76 → 630.72] It's really easy to turn RTX on.
[630.72 → 632.18] You can save development dollars.
[632.28 → 633.94] By just throwing RTX on your game.
[634.02 → 635.16] Then it'll look perfect.
[635.24 → 636.12] You can get great screenshots.
[636.28 → 637.02] And get great demos.
[637.18 → 639.14] Some people will have a great experience in the game.
[639.40 → 640.46] To just turn RTX on.
[640.62 → 642.74] And then for all the plebs.
[643.12 → 643.34] Who.
[644.64 → 645.04] Maybe.
[645.38 → 645.72] You know.
[645.80 → 647.12] You just don't care about.
[647.46 → 647.62] Or.
[648.18 → 648.54] Whatever.
[648.78 → 650.54] They can just have a garbage experience.
[651.14 → 651.40] Yeah.
[651.50 → 653.64] And I'm hoping that whatever game it was.
[653.70 → 655.62] And I think this is why I'm not allowed to say it.
[656.02 → 658.64] Is because they're probably going to work on their RTX off.
[659.36 → 659.76] Okay.
[659.76 → 661.84] But I think Nvidia wanted to show it.
[662.28 → 664.10] Before they had worked on their RTX off.
[664.22 → 664.90] Of course.
[665.02 → 666.92] So I think the RTX off will get better.
[667.56 → 668.68] Because they'll work on it.
[668.76 → 671.70] But it revealed this potential scenario.
[672.02 → 673.96] Where they just plug RTX into their game.
[674.04 → 674.30] And they're like.
[674.36 → 674.82] Well that's enough.
[674.94 → 676.32] You know what it seems like to me.
[678.22 → 679.86] This whole thing is just not ready.
[681.10 → 681.24] Yeah.
[681.28 → 681.98] And it's being rushed.
[682.34 → 682.58] Yeah.
[682.58 → 685.66] I really, really like the idea of the tech.
[685.98 → 686.68] Like the hardware.
[687.14 → 687.54] Yeah.
[687.54 → 688.66] Not ray tracing necessarily.
[688.86 → 689.96] But having the AI cores.
[690.34 → 693.12] Being able to move things onto the AI cores.
[693.44 → 696.64] Because with having async on your CUBA cores.
[696.80 → 696.90] Yeah.
[696.96 → 698.46] And having like physical async.
[698.56 → 701.32] With being able to move things to the other cores.
[701.54 → 703.52] Like being able to pull antialiasing.
[703.74 → 705.26] And putting it on one of the AI cores and stuff.
[705.36 → 706.22] That's super cool.
[706.22 → 708.22] I really, really like that stuff.
[710.74 → 711.46] I don't know.
[711.62 → 712.84] So part of my idea is.
[712.94 → 714.04] I think they're trying to add.
[714.18 → 716.12] Something a little bit less tangible.
[716.38 → 719.18] To the difference between NVIDIA cards and AMD cards.
[719.32 → 720.34] You mean more tangible.
[721.20 → 724.42] Or something less quantitatively measurable.
[724.42 → 724.54] Yeah.
[724.72 → 726.22] So like an FPS number.
[726.60 → 727.52] And a dollar number.
[728.26 → 728.50] Are very.
[728.64 → 729.92] We used to.
[730.00 → 730.82] I'm sure we still do.
[731.06 → 733.30] Make dollar per performance graphs for everything.
[733.80 → 734.60] All the time.
[734.60 → 736.20] Because it's a perfect measure.
[736.30 → 736.54] But that's.
[736.60 → 738.12] They've been trying to do that for years.
[738.26 → 739.70] With GF experience.
[739.94 → 740.72] Which by the way.
[740.82 → 742.46] I don't think was unintentional.
[742.78 → 743.84] GeForce experience.
[744.12 → 744.96] GF experience.
[745.38 → 745.68] Yeah.
[745.70 → 746.00] I know.
[746.08 → 746.28] Right.
[746.48 → 746.80] Okay.
[746.94 → 747.30] I mean.
[747.38 → 749.32] They also called a TV.
[750.02 → 750.28] Yeah.
[750.46 → 752.08] A BFG display.
[752.28 → 752.78] BFD.
[752.96 → 753.10] Yeah.
[753.14 → 753.42] Yeah.
[753.80 → 754.08] I mean.
[754.14 → 755.08] These guys man.
[755.84 → 756.28] Anyway.
[756.46 → 756.78] Anyway.
[756.88 → 757.12] Anyway.
[757.12 → 757.22] Anyway.
[757.22 → 758.18] The point is.
[758.28 → 760.56] They've been trying to differentiate themselves.
[760.90 → 761.86] Through features.
[762.28 → 763.12] And experience.
[763.12 → 764.32] For years now.
[764.40 → 765.04] I don't blame them for.
[765.04 → 765.28] Which.
[765.28 → 766.68] Which I don't blame them for at all.
[766.76 → 766.88] Yeah.
[767.36 → 767.72] But.
[768.54 → 769.64] And for a long time.
[769.70 → 770.16] To be honest.
[770.30 → 771.38] I think they kind of had it.
[772.22 → 772.74] And then.
[772.86 → 774.34] I think they pissed a lot of people off.
[774.46 → 776.08] With the GF experience stuff.
[776.42 → 776.58] Yeah.
[776.58 → 778.20] They've helped it a lot.
[778.30 → 779.62] I'm going to keep giving them credit for this.
[779.76 → 779.94] Yeah.
[780.02 → 780.52] Because now there's.
[780.66 → 781.92] It's way more simple.
[782.00 → 782.92] It's way easier to not install it.
[782.94 → 783.14] Yeah.
[783.16 → 783.88] I appreciate that.
[785.34 → 785.88] That is.
[785.94 → 786.48] That is way.
[786.56 → 786.64] Way.
[786.70 → 787.02] Way better.
[787.40 → 787.76] I don't know.
[787.98 → 789.24] AFK Jim 420.
[789.48 → 789.70] Says.
[789.70 → 790.82] I see the new architecture.
[790.82 → 794.14] Will make the RTX cards viable for longer as they age.
[794.34 → 796.76] Being able to offload some of the work to other cores.
[796.94 → 797.22] Okay.
[797.58 → 798.94] The issue with that.
[799.08 → 803.18] Is that unless NVIDIA absolutely nailed it.
[803.64 → 803.92] Like.
[803.92 → 806.06] This is the first attempt.
[806.74 → 808.92] And I don't think I've ever seen that happen before.
[809.56 → 809.76] Where.
[810.00 → 810.90] Whether it's.
[811.04 → 812.16] Beefing up a GPU.
[812.50 → 812.68] Like.
[812.70 → 813.22] Whenever it is.
[813.30 → 814.24] The next.
[814.50 → 816.36] The next gen GPU tech.
[816.44 → 817.74] Whether it's a tessellation.
[817.96 → 818.82] Or whether it's.
[819.30 → 820.60] A new shader model.
[820.90 → 822.20] Or whatever the case may be.
[822.26 → 824.42] Whenever there's some new piece of tech that lands.
[824.86 → 827.16] The first implementation in hardware.
[827.52 → 829.10] Always kind of misses something.
[829.92 → 831.44] And it's the tweaked one.
[831.78 → 832.10] That goes.
[832.22 → 832.56] Oh yeah.
[832.56 → 836.38] We just needed a little bit more reinforcement over there.
[836.46 → 836.92] And oh okay.
[837.02 → 837.38] Now.
[837.76 → 838.16] We are.
[838.24 → 838.72] We're not.
[838.80 → 840.42] We're not starving the rest of the pipeline.
[840.64 → 840.98] Wooloo.
[841.10 → 841.70] It's much better.
[842.34 → 842.90] I just.
[843.06 → 843.56] I have.
[843.74 → 845.26] I just am so.
[846.92 → 848.06] I'm so hesitant.
[848.56 → 849.22] To just say.
[849.34 → 849.66] You know.
[849.76 → 850.04] Yeah.
[850.64 → 851.48] Go ahead.
[851.80 → 853.90] That way you're going to have the tech that you need going forward.
[853.96 → 854.92] It's future-proof.
[855.48 → 856.72] Well that's never a good idea.
[856.86 → 857.26] Exactly.
[857.42 → 857.80] It's like.
[857.80 → 859.18] So when I was shopping for my car.
[859.46 → 861.30] One of the reasons I ended up with the Volt.
[861.30 → 861.38] Volt.
[861.58 → 863.40] Is that it is the.
[864.44 → 864.92] Shoot.
[865.28 → 865.52] Yes.
[865.76 → 867.18] So the 2017 Volt.
[867.38 → 869.34] Is the second model year.
[869.66 → 872.16] Of the third generation design of this car.
[873.12 → 874.50] Now you compare that.
[874.62 → 876.74] One of the other cars I was looking at was the Honda Clarity.
[876.74 → 879.54] That is the first model year.
[879.60 → 880.66] It is an all new.
[880.90 → 881.64] Actually it's an all.
[881.70 → 883.42] It was the all new model year.
[883.66 → 885.40] Of a completely new car.
[885.68 → 886.84] That's what mine is.
[887.20 → 887.88] Which is.
[889.00 → 889.40] Terrifying.
[889.66 → 890.04] Because.
[891.18 → 893.46] From one car manufacturer to another.
[893.60 → 896.36] I don't think there are any exceptions here that I'm aware of.
[896.84 → 898.10] The all new platform.
[898.66 → 900.72] Tends to have some bugs that need to be wrinkled out.
[900.96 → 902.68] And that do get fixed over the next two to three years.
[902.68 → 905.66] So yeah I bought my car used for sureties.
[905.96 → 908.04] And they were like done with that model.
[908.74 → 909.94] By the time I bought the car.
[910.06 → 911.82] And I knew any potential problems that it might have.
[912.20 → 912.84] To be clear.
[912.96 → 914.00] So that helps a lot.
[914.10 → 914.26] Yeah.
[914.52 → 915.52] But in my case.
[915.70 → 916.74] I was going in.
[917.24 → 918.52] Completely cold on the Clarity.
[918.72 → 918.82] Yeah.
[918.82 → 920.94] They only had a handful of them for Canada, apparently.
[921.80 → 922.10] So.
[923.18 → 924.16] I just.
[925.90 → 926.30] Yeah.
[926.30 → 928.76] We'll see.
[928.76 → 929.70] To be clear.
[929.92 → 930.10] Like.
[930.48 → 932.18] It could be a super awesome.
[932.66 → 935.04] I think it probably will be a great card.
[935.44 → 938.50] I think a lot of the media right now.
[938.84 → 941.78] I think a lot of the fans are confused by some of the media reaction.
[941.78 → 944.48] Because the media is really frustrated that we don't have performance stuff.
[944.56 → 945.96] There's been really weird embargo setups.
[946.38 → 949.92] And that Tom's article just set everyone on fire.
[951.52 → 951.80] But like.
[952.14 → 953.32] Set themselves on fire is what they did.
[953.38 → 954.76] It sounds really cool.
[955.20 → 955.42] Yeah.
[955.42 → 957.16] I'm not scared of this card.
[957.30 → 957.44] Like.
[957.52 → 958.28] I don't think it's going to.
[958.56 → 960.72] If the RTX stuff doesn't work that great.
[960.72 → 961.60] You just turn it off.
[961.76 → 964.02] So you can hate a lot of things about Nvidia.
[964.44 → 965.52] You can hate their marketing.
[966.04 → 967.24] You can hate their prices.
[967.74 → 968.86] You can hate their.
[969.04 → 971.16] You can hate the way that they engage with the market.
[971.30 → 972.00] And with their partners.
[972.00 → 973.58] With the GeForce partner program.
[973.78 → 973.88] Yeah.
[974.80 → 975.18] But.
[975.96 → 976.36] You are.
[976.48 → 978.34] You're probably missing something.
[978.54 → 978.64] Like.
[978.76 → 978.88] There's.
[979.04 → 979.92] A problem.
[980.42 → 982.66] Likely exists between the keyboard and chair.
[982.96 → 984.52] Unless you're a member of the Linux community.
[984.52 → 987.86] Because they really haven't treated that community very well over the years.
[988.16 → 990.30] But there's probably something else wrong.
[990.48 → 993.20] If you look at the product itself.
[993.20 → 993.82] And you go.
[993.98 → 994.28] You know.
[994.74 → 995.50] It's bad.
[995.76 → 995.94] Yeah.
[996.02 → 996.46] They're good.
[996.52 → 996.96] It's not.
[997.52 → 997.92] Bad.
[998.18 → 998.32] Yeah.
[998.32 → 998.38] Yeah.
[998.38 → 1000.90] You can have a lot of problems with Nvidia.
[1001.10 → 1002.34] With Nvidia products.
[1002.98 → 1004.60] But as a general rule.
[1004.60 → 1005.74] They aren't bad.
[1005.94 → 1008.78] They might not be the best value per dollar.
[1008.78 → 1011.14] For the particular workload that you're looking at.
[1011.24 → 1012.40] But there are a lot of things.
[1012.98 → 1013.16] That.
[1013.72 → 1014.78] In fairness to Nvidia.
[1014.78 → 1016.38] We have to give them credit for.
[1016.66 → 1018.78] They support legacy products.
[1018.78 → 1022.30] For an UN-freaking-believable amount of time.
[1023.04 → 1023.18] Like.
[1024.12 → 1025.78] How far does it go back now?
[1025.92 → 1026.32] I am.
[1026.52 → 1026.96] Actually.
[1027.12 → 1027.46] I'm quiet.
[1027.58 → 1028.44] I'm quite curious.
[1029.40 → 1030.60] If you go on their site.
[1031.50 → 1035.16] How far back does the latest GeForce driver go?
[1036.14 → 1037.88] So let's throw 10 series in here.
[1037.96 → 1039.60] So they've still got downloads on their site.
[1039.64 → 1040.78] Going all the way back.
[1041.52 → 1041.84] To.
[1042.84 → 1043.56] GeForce.
[1044.34 → 1044.82] What?
[1044.82 → 1046.48] Oh crap.
[1046.72 → 1048.22] It keeps screwing up and scrolling.
[1049.00 → 1050.18] GeForce 6 series.
[1050.98 → 1052.68] And their most recent driver.
[1053.24 → 1053.78] So they've.
[1053.90 → 1055.20] It only goes up to Windows 7.
[1055.38 → 1055.98] But bear in mind.
[1056.06 → 1058.78] You can typically install a Windows 7 driver on Windows 10.
[1059.04 → 1060.64] They supported that card.
[1060.98 → 1062.66] Up to 2015.
[1064.12 → 1064.42] Okay.
[1064.84 → 1066.12] So the 6800.
[1066.12 → 1066.66] That's pretty insane.
[1066.98 → 1067.44] GT.
[1067.88 → 1068.32] Ultra.
[1068.94 → 1069.04] Oh.
[1069.30 → 1070.28] Did they launch with the.
[1070.28 → 1071.28] I think they launched with the GT.
[1071.78 → 1073.44] So the 6800 GT.
[1073.44 → 1073.60] GT.
[1074.50 → 1075.96] Was launched in.
[1077.66 → 1078.68] Son of a.
[1079.06 → 1079.22] Okay.
[1079.76 → 1080.08] Two.
[1080.44 → 1080.78] No.
[1080.94 → 1081.12] Oh.
[1081.68 → 1082.06] There's so.
[1082.14 → 1082.28] Oh.
[1082.32 → 1082.76] Here we go.
[1083.06 → 1085.34] Was launched in 2004.
[1086.64 → 1088.54] They supported that card.
[1089.18 → 1089.54] For.
[1089.88 → 1090.54] 11 years.
[1091.10 → 1091.38] Yeah.
[1091.66 → 1092.08] I'll let.
[1092.38 → 1093.64] Well it's February 2015.
[1093.80 → 1094.72] It was late 2004.
[1095.30 → 1096.82] So 10 years.
[1097.32 → 1098.56] When you compare that.
[1098.56 → 1101.86] To what the typical smartphone manufacturer will do.
[1102.04 → 1102.50] Like Apple.
[1102.50 → 1105.68] Apple's a shining beacon in the smartphone industry.
[1105.68 → 1106.96] In terms of model support.
[1107.04 → 1109.76] I was looking at a table of how long Apple has supported their devices.
[1110.10 → 1112.42] And it's anywhere from three years and.
[1112.52 → 1113.40] And lots of change.
[1113.40 → 1114.36] Like almost four.
[1114.58 → 1115.90] To four and a half years.
[1115.98 → 1118.30] And in some cases even a little over four and a half years.
[1118.68 → 1120.20] When even Google.
[1120.20 → 1121.22] Is only committing.
[1121.22 → 1122.04] What two years.
[1122.16 → 1123.56] I think for pixel devices.
[1123.56 → 1124.56] Something like that.
[1124.56 → 1125.66] I think OnePlus is committing.
[1125.96 → 1126.06] Something like that.
[1126.06 → 1126.92] Two OS updates.
[1127.06 → 1128.10] So about two years.
[1129.24 → 1130.28] We got to give them.
[1130.88 → 1131.82] Credit for.
[1132.50 → 1133.64] What they do well.
[1133.72 → 1134.94] It's not a bad product.
[1135.08 → 1136.26] Someone in chat is saying.
[1136.70 → 1138.86] They just bully partners to buy old cards.
[1139.36 → 1139.94] What does that mean?
[1139.94 → 1140.06] But not bad.
[1140.12 → 1140.28] Sure.
[1140.38 → 1141.00] I don't know.
[1141.10 → 1142.16] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[1142.16 → 1142.90] I don't know what it means.
[1143.10 → 1145.48] And that's literally the point we're talking about.
[1145.54 → 1146.42] Is that the product is.
[1147.14 → 1147.54] Yeah.
[1147.74 → 1147.88] So.
[1148.06 → 1149.18] You might not like other things.
[1149.18 → 1150.14] There can be all kinds.
[1150.20 → 1152.20] And you can not buy Nvidia out of principle.
[1152.38 → 1154.52] And I'm sure you could find a dozen reasons to do it.
[1154.92 → 1155.78] That's not the point.
[1156.08 → 1157.14] The point is that.
[1157.34 → 1158.98] We don't have a reason to believe.
[1159.16 → 1161.52] That the upcoming RTX cards will be bad.
[1161.72 → 1161.92] Yeah.
[1162.12 → 1164.82] We just also don't have a reason to believe.
[1165.02 → 1166.98] That RTX will be.
[1167.68 → 1169.96] The game changing feature that they say it will.
[1169.96 → 1171.62] Or that the RTX cards.
[1171.92 → 1174.42] Will fully enable the.
[1174.92 → 1177.06] Will give you the full experience of that.
[1177.06 → 1179.30] As new games come out.
[1179.36 → 1180.22] Over the coming years.
[1180.58 → 1181.06] And hopefully.
[1181.18 → 1181.54] Hopefully.
[1181.78 → 1182.52] Hopefully it does.
[1182.66 → 1183.14] Hopefully it does.
[1183.20 → 1184.00] Hopefully we're totally wrong.
[1184.16 → 1184.74] But we have no idea.
[1184.84 → 1185.18] Super cool.
[1185.60 → 1187.88] But until Nvidia is willing to.
[1187.92 → 1188.84] Well it's not even that we're wrong.
[1188.92 → 1190.22] We just don't have any information.
[1190.36 → 1190.46] Yeah.
[1190.52 → 1192.06] Until they're willing to put up or shut up.
[1192.14 → 1193.30] Like what are we supposed to say?
[1193.40 → 1193.50] Yeah.
[1193.50 → 1194.64] If we can't test RTX.
[1195.02 → 1196.34] Then we can't form an opinion.
[1196.72 → 1196.88] Yeah.
[1196.94 → 1197.66] So right now.
[1197.66 → 1199.70] All we can do is speculate based on the past.
[1199.86 → 1200.50] And in the past.
[1200.60 → 1201.44] I've observed this pattern.
[1201.58 → 1202.92] So that's all I can really tell you guys.
[1203.18 → 1203.28] Yeah.
[1204.34 → 1204.84] All right.
[1204.90 → 1205.40] Let's have a look.
[1205.48 → 1205.82] Oh yeah.
[1205.92 → 1206.54] So right.
[1206.54 → 1208.12] They're finally talking about performance.
[1208.12 → 1209.70] And these slides aren't like.
[1210.76 → 1211.60] Exceedingly helpful.
[1211.98 → 1212.20] But.
[1212.64 → 1213.36] As per usual.
[1213.66 → 1213.96] Yeah.
[1214.06 → 1215.30] So as per usual.
[1215.30 → 1216.44] They're just kind of vague.
[1216.52 → 1217.20] But there you go.
[1217.54 → 1218.80] We've got something to work with here.
[1218.84 → 1221.02] The original source is from overclock3d.net.
[1221.78 → 1222.04] But.
[1222.18 → 1223.24] Oh that's deep learning imaging.
[1223.24 → 1224.46] So they're saying both.
[1224.76 → 1226.50] RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti.
[1227.02 → 1229.60] Are going to be capable of 4K 60 FPS gaming.
[1230.28 → 1232.50] What the crap does this line mean?
[1233.06 → 1234.80] I am not sure.
[1235.12 → 1235.96] Is this zero?
[1235.96 → 1237.18] Is this 30?
[1237.58 → 1238.80] I'm not sure.
[1240.28 → 1242.36] This is actually like pretty much the worst.
[1242.92 → 1243.90] Not the worst.
[1244.04 → 1245.38] But it's like it's close to there.
[1245.70 → 1246.04] Yeah.
[1246.42 → 1247.62] It's pretty dumb.
[1249.18 → 1249.42] And.
[1249.68 → 1250.18] Because like what.
[1250.28 → 1251.60] What actually goes down?
[1252.66 → 1253.24] This.
[1253.40 → 1254.12] Is it the frame rate?
[1254.24 → 1254.88] Or is it the resolution?
[1254.88 → 1256.16] Is it both?
[1256.26 → 1257.84] But like by weird amounts?
[1258.02 → 1258.72] I don't know.
[1259.02 → 1263.32] Like this is basically what is causing all of this speculation around RTX.
[1263.66 → 1265.42] And that like maybe it sucks.
[1265.50 → 1266.96] Because NVIDIA is just.
[1267.10 → 1270.30] And this looks like kind of dumb response to all of it.
[1270.36 → 1274.72] Because NVIDIA is just being so tight-lipped about the whole thing.
[1274.88 → 1275.58] And just going.
[1275.66 → 1276.08] No, no, no.
[1276.14 → 1276.50] Ray tracing.
[1276.58 → 1276.90] Ray tracing.
[1277.00 → 1277.42] Ray tracing.
[1277.42 → 1279.18] When really a lot of gamers.
[1279.54 → 1282.40] Especially the ones that are playing games that won't have ray tracing.
[1282.74 → 1282.82] Like.
[1283.92 → 1284.56] I don't know.
[1284.62 → 1286.36] That's another thing I got from the demo.
[1286.56 → 1288.60] You will not want it on for multiplayer.
[1289.36 → 1290.02] Well, yeah.
[1290.54 → 1291.26] Like ever.
[1291.68 → 1292.34] At all.
[1292.44 → 1293.24] Like ever.
[1293.48 → 1294.40] I don't think ever.
[1294.62 → 1294.88] Really?
[1295.02 → 1295.20] Why?
[1295.54 → 1297.04] Because there are more shadows.
[1298.16 → 1298.74] Oh, I see.
[1299.50 → 1301.36] And like darker shadows.
[1301.36 → 1305.60] Because if you definitely know where the light source is coming from.
[1305.84 → 1306.14] Yeah.
[1308.70 → 1311.74] Instead of just like washing a room with light.
[1312.50 → 1313.14] It's going to.
[1313.24 → 1313.88] There's going to be like.
[1314.02 → 1316.54] Oh, there's like a branch that crosses the light source here.
[1316.62 → 1318.52] So there's a huge shadow cast across that whole area.
[1318.70 → 1319.06] Okay.
[1319.54 → 1319.92] Wait.
[1321.14 → 1323.38] I am going to pitch you something here.
[1323.88 → 1324.18] Okay.
[1324.18 → 1325.82] What about Rainbow Six?
[1328.26 → 1329.18] Rainbow Six specifically.
[1330.12 → 1330.56] Like Siege?
[1330.60 → 1331.18] Are you talking to Siege?
[1331.18 → 1332.34] I'm talking about.
[1332.70 → 1334.70] I'm talking about Rainbow Six style games.
[1335.14 → 1335.46] Okay.
[1335.92 → 1336.54] So yeah.
[1336.62 → 1338.02] Siege is the one everyone's playing right now.
[1338.10 → 1338.26] Yeah.
[1338.36 → 1338.46] Yeah.
[1338.54 → 1338.58] Yeah.
[1338.72 → 1342.08] Where basically interacting with the environment.
[1342.40 → 1344.54] Is a huge part of the gameplay.
[1345.10 → 1345.38] Uh huh.
[1345.62 → 1347.10] So if you could.
[1348.88 → 1349.88] Hit a light.
[1350.80 → 1353.64] Causing a shadow of an opponent to appear somewhere.
[1354.82 → 1357.10] The more realistic that interaction.
[1357.28 → 1358.14] Potentially the better.
[1358.36 → 1359.22] If you hit a light.
[1359.50 → 1361.14] Like if you shoot out a bulb or something.
[1361.14 → 1362.36] If you turn a light off though.
[1363.20 → 1363.54] Yes.
[1364.14 → 1365.60] Or what if you could add one?
[1365.66 → 1366.40] Would you throw a flare?
[1368.30 → 1368.86] I'm just.
[1368.94 → 1370.08] I'm just throwing that out there.
[1370.20 → 1371.90] What if they made it a fundamental.
[1372.00 → 1374.12] Because this is the whole conversation that.
[1374.30 → 1375.58] I'm sure we've had multiple times.
[1375.58 → 1378.04] But I've had definitely with a lot of people over the years.
[1378.10 → 1381.54] Going all the way back to when Phys was first introduced.
[1381.64 → 1383.02] And what was that stupid game?
[1384.80 → 1385.16] Uh.
[1386.80 → 1387.24] Shoot.
[1387.38 → 1387.88] I forget.
[1387.88 → 1390.14] It was like a.
[1390.14 → 1391.68] Like a space marine style.
[1391.68 → 1393.20] Like running around game.
[1393.36 → 1395.70] But Phys was a fundamental.
[1396.54 → 1397.70] Part of the gameplay.
[1398.90 → 1399.76] Demo game.
[1399.82 → 1400.54] Are you talking about Borderlands?
[1400.82 → 1401.28] No.
[1401.66 → 1402.82] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1403.36 → 1403.98] It was.
[1405.58 → 1406.52] Oh, no.
[1406.62 → 1407.78] Are you talking about that game that you could.
[1407.78 → 1407.94] Twitch chat.
[1408.20 → 1408.72] Help me.
[1408.86 → 1410.88] Run faster in if you had an Intel SSD.
[1411.02 → 1412.92] No, it was basically a demo.
[1413.14 → 1415.02] Like this is before the NVIDIA.
[1415.42 → 1416.44] Cell Factor Revolution.
[1416.46 → 1416.62] Yeah.
[1416.72 → 1417.46] Cell Factor.
[1417.72 → 1418.04] Yes.
[1418.12 → 1418.66] Thank you.
[1418.82 → 1419.80] Good call Ricky Dog.
[1419.94 → 1420.42] Thank you.
[1420.52 → 1421.16] Cell Factor.
[1421.74 → 1422.64] Rick Yoga.
[1423.22 → 1423.40] Sorry.
[1424.66 → 1426.00] No, not Cell Factory.
[1426.18 → 1426.30] Yeah.
[1426.36 → 1427.18] Like it disappeared.
[1427.30 → 1428.20] It never got finished.
[1428.94 → 1429.38] Um.
[1429.66 → 1430.54] But there was like.
[1430.60 → 1432.78] Like you could like to do physics things.
[1432.78 → 1434.20] And like move stuff around.
[1434.36 → 1435.00] And like it was.
[1435.74 → 1436.18] Um.
[1437.10 → 1437.50] Wait.
[1437.58 → 1438.42] Was it Cell Factor?
[1438.50 → 1438.64] No.
[1438.72 → 1439.02] Hold on.
[1439.02 → 1442.08] No, it wasn't Roblox.
[1442.16 → 1442.46] I think.
[1442.54 → 1443.84] I think it was Cell Factor.
[1444.56 → 1446.76] As far as I know it like never got finished.
[1447.62 → 1448.04] Yeah.
[1448.06 → 1448.94] I'm pretty sure it was Cell Factor.
[1449.04 → 1449.24] Anyway.
[1449.32 → 1449.62] Anyway.
[1449.70 → 1449.88] Anyway.
[1450.10 → 1451.12] The point is.
[1451.40 → 1452.44] It was this cool demo.
[1452.64 → 1455.82] Where Phys was a fundamental core part of gameplay.
[1456.02 → 1457.96] But it never took off.
[1458.02 → 1461.22] Because you couldn't count on everyone to have Phys.
[1461.72 → 1463.24] I mean especially because at the time.
[1463.24 → 1463.66] It was.
[1463.76 → 1465.86] It was like a hardware card that you had to buy.
[1465.94 → 1467.20] It was a separate accelerator card.
[1467.20 → 1468.62] Um.
[1469.06 → 1470.76] This whole thing feels very Phys.
[1470.84 → 1471.96] But built into the card.
[1472.40 → 1472.76] Yeah.
[1472.94 → 1473.56] But the thing is.
[1473.64 → 1474.72] Is that we've had Phys.
[1474.88 → 1475.84] Built into the card.
[1476.02 → 1476.66] And still.
[1476.80 → 1477.56] All you can do us.
[1477.80 → 1479.06] Kick garbage around on the ground.
[1479.06 → 1479.76] As Batman.
[1480.30 → 1481.74] And see your cape flutter better.
[1481.80 → 1482.48] Because of Phys.
[1482.54 → 1484.28] Like it's still not a core part of gameplay.
[1484.84 → 1485.28] So.
[1485.54 → 1486.04] To me.
[1486.48 → 1487.54] I think you could.
[1487.68 → 1487.92] If.
[1488.16 → 1489.90] If the Rainbow Six developers were like.
[1489.90 → 1490.26] Yeah.
[1490.80 → 1493.42] We're going to take the destructibility of the environment.
[1493.88 → 1495.34] And the lighting of the environment.
[1495.34 → 1496.16] To a whole new level.
[1496.26 → 1497.62] But you have to have RTX.
[1497.82 → 1500.40] I think no game that's actually going to be competitive.
[1500.40 → 1501.64] Would ever do that.
[1506.62 → 1508.12] Uneven playing field for hardware.
[1508.32 → 1510.76] Is not something that has ever gone well for competitive games.
[1510.76 → 1511.00] No.
[1511.16 → 1513.86] And requiring people to have super high-end hardware.
[1514.12 → 1515.24] Is just not a thing.
[1515.30 → 1516.62] I guess that's where I'm going with this.
[1516.62 → 1517.00] Is that.
[1517.68 → 1518.08] You.
[1518.22 → 1520.72] You won't be able to make it fundamental to gameplay.
[1521.36 → 1523.40] Unless you can count on everyone having it.
[1523.40 → 1524.58] If you can set up.
[1524.78 → 1525.78] If you can like.
[1526.32 → 1526.60] Shoot.
[1527.24 → 1527.40] Yeah.
[1527.40 → 1528.88] A door off a car.
[1528.88 → 1529.06] Yeah.
[1529.48 → 1529.98] And then.
[1530.26 → 1532.18] Use the reflections off the door.
[1532.26 → 1533.72] To like to see someone coming around the corner.
[1533.94 → 1534.14] Yeah.
[1534.22 → 1535.60] Like that sounds freaking sweet.
[1535.88 → 1536.10] Yeah.
[1536.26 → 1538.02] Sounds pretty single player to me dude.
[1538.64 → 1538.96] Yeah.
[1539.20 → 1539.48] Like.
[1539.70 → 1540.26] I don't.
[1540.40 → 1542.04] I don't think that's going to be a thing.
[1543.34 → 1545.00] And it sounds single player.
[1545.18 → 1545.72] But like.
[1545.96 → 1547.04] Not fundamental to gameplay.
[1547.26 → 1548.32] Single player games are great.
[1548.44 → 1548.80] There was a.
[1548.88 → 1549.34] Very recently.
[1549.34 → 1550.74] There was a thread trending on.
[1550.74 → 1552.58] I don't remember what that was talking about.
[1552.62 → 1555.78] How it's like people that just don't play multiplayer games anymore.
[1555.78 → 1556.68] And all this kind of stuff.
[1556.80 → 1559.26] And there's actually a lot of really great single player games.
[1559.30 → 1560.20] That have been coming out for a while.
[1560.34 → 1562.60] There's quite a few great single player games on the horizon.
[1562.82 → 1564.32] And you might even find like.
[1564.70 → 1566.08] EVE multiplayer games.
[1566.46 → 1567.54] Where you don't care as much.
[1568.40 → 1568.68] Sure.
[1568.98 → 1569.38] Okay.
[1569.52 → 1571.02] And you might just want the lighting.
[1571.02 → 1572.44] Because you want it to look really cool.
[1572.64 → 1573.42] And that might all.
[1573.50 → 1574.04] That's all great.
[1574.10 → 1574.58] That's all awesome.
[1574.58 → 1575.10] I'm not saying.
[1575.44 → 1576.58] There isn't benefits to it.
[1576.66 → 1577.28] I just think like.
[1577.28 → 1579.18] People who want to be hardcore competitive.
[1579.36 → 1579.46] Yeah.
[1579.78 → 1581.44] I don't think that's going to be a thing.
[1581.52 → 1582.44] It probably won't even be an option.
[1582.52 → 1583.10] And I'm just saying.
[1583.20 → 1585.00] Until you can make it fundamental to gameplay.
[1585.32 → 1586.22] It's always.
[1586.66 → 1588.36] It's always a bell and whistle.
[1590.40 → 1590.76] And.
[1591.02 → 1592.10] There's some people that will care.
[1592.54 → 1592.78] Yeah.
[1592.84 → 1593.58] There's definitely some people that will care.
[1593.58 → 1594.72] But just like gameplay is king.
[1595.24 → 1595.44] Like.
[1595.58 → 1595.70] You know.
[1595.76 → 1597.02] It's the whole Nintendo thing.
[1597.18 → 1597.34] Yeah.
[1597.60 → 1597.96] Where.
[1598.28 → 1599.12] And I completely agree with that.
[1599.12 → 1601.22] The Switch doesn't look any better than.
[1601.44 → 1601.74] What?
[1601.80 → 1602.78] Like a PS3?
[1604.28 → 1604.92] If that.
[1604.92 → 1605.68] Is it even.
[1605.80 → 1607.20] Does it even look as good as a PS3?
[1607.20 → 1608.18] It's a hard thing to compare.
[1608.22 → 1609.62] When did the stupid PS3 come out?
[1609.80 → 1611.42] If you define look as good.
[1611.54 → 1613.52] That would be like what resolution and frame rate it can push.
[1613.68 → 1613.78] But.
[1614.06 → 1617.24] Nintendo titles on general have like a way different art style.
[1617.50 → 1617.68] Which actually.
[1617.68 → 1617.90] They do.
[1618.10 → 1618.44] They do.
[1618.52 → 1619.92] Doesn't need more hardware.
[1620.24 → 1621.90] But that's exactly the point is like.
[1623.26 → 1625.02] Gameplay is far more important.
[1625.32 → 1625.60] Oh yeah.
[1625.60 → 1625.72] Than.
[1627.10 → 1627.54] Lighting.
[1627.64 → 1628.80] I've had more fun on my Switch.
[1628.90 → 1629.14] Physics.
[1629.14 → 1630.20] For like a long time.
[1630.94 → 1632.10] Than my computer.
[1633.46 → 1633.80] Rip.
[1634.92 → 1637.88] Honestly.
[1638.42 → 1643.46] 95% of my gaming time in the last few months has been Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[1643.84 → 1644.16] Oh yeah.
[1644.32 → 1644.72] It's great.
[1644.90 → 1645.54] It's a great game.
[1645.60 → 1646.34] I'm not done yet.
[1646.72 → 1647.12] But like.
[1647.22 → 1647.72] I don't care.
[1648.68 → 1649.98] Because I just go and like.
[1650.50 → 1651.50] Walk around the mountains.
[1651.76 → 1652.08] And like.
[1652.32 → 1653.18] Find snails.
[1653.44 → 1653.62] Yeah.
[1653.84 → 1654.42] And like.
[1654.78 → 1654.98] Dude.
[1655.06 → 1655.24] Oh.
[1655.38 → 1656.28] Super Mario Tennis.
[1656.68 → 1657.06] Aces.
[1657.76 → 1658.94] Actually super fun.
[1659.16 → 1659.40] Yeah.
[1659.76 → 1660.08] I was.
[1660.08 → 1660.40] I was like.
[1660.50 → 1661.08] When I got it.
[1661.16 → 1661.54] I was like.
[1662.50 → 1664.56] It's like a full price tennis title.
[1664.92 → 1665.74] Have you played Overcooked?
[1665.92 → 1666.26] Oof.
[1666.70 → 1667.04] No.
[1667.18 → 1667.96] But it looks perfect.
[1667.96 → 1669.44] I tried it for the first time.
[1669.88 → 1670.50] Last week.
[1671.00 → 1671.94] It's perfect.
[1672.08 → 1672.28] Yeah.
[1672.40 → 1673.10] So we're gonna.
[1673.32 → 1674.00] When we do the land.
[1674.06 → 1675.04] Do you know about the land centre?
[1675.46 → 1675.70] Yeah.
[1675.78 → 1677.58] I was there when we made the decision to.
[1677.66 → 1677.92] Sick.
[1678.02 → 1678.20] Okay.
[1678.32 → 1678.46] Yeah.
[1678.46 → 1679.74] So when we build the land centre.
[1679.86 → 1681.08] I want to put like a big screen.
[1681.20 → 1681.70] Like a projector.
[1682.46 → 1682.56] Yeah.
[1682.56 → 1683.22] And that'll be.
[1683.44 → 1684.38] So we'll have consoles.
[1684.58 → 1685.32] And a PC.
[1685.56 → 1686.22] With controllers.
[1686.22 → 1688.42] But I want that to be like the.
[1688.64 → 1689.00] The.
[1689.12 → 1690.22] The local multiplayer.
[1690.44 → 1690.62] Yeah.
[1690.82 → 1691.58] Set up spot.
[1691.72 → 1693.40] And we are going to play some Overcooked.
[1693.68 → 1694.02] Hell yeah.
[1694.26 → 1694.82] For sure.
[1694.92 → 1695.20] Definitely.
[1695.54 → 1697.72] I'm actually so excited about that land centre.
[1698.18 → 1698.54] Me too.
[1698.62 → 1699.90] I haven't watched it yet.
[1699.98 → 1701.92] But it was cool that you had nothing up here.
[1702.70 → 1702.98] Yeah.
[1703.28 → 1703.80] Do you even.
[1704.16 → 1704.78] Did you know.
[1705.28 → 1706.02] Not much.
[1706.16 → 1706.28] Yeah.
[1706.28 → 1708.26] I had to like to stream a PDA him before.
[1708.48 → 1708.80] But like.
[1708.80 → 1708.88] Yeah.
[1708.88 → 1709.62] I didn't feel bad.
[1709.62 → 1710.10] Because he.
[1710.44 → 1710.74] Like.
[1711.00 → 1711.44] He was like.
[1711.50 → 1711.68] Yeah.
[1711.80 → 1713.50] I'm pretty sure I watched your videos before.
[1713.50 → 1715.98] It was like an Intel thing to kind of put us together.
[1716.12 → 1716.22] Yeah.
[1716.22 → 1716.28] Yeah.
[1716.28 → 1716.60] Honestly.
[1716.74 → 1718.70] I had a lot of fun just doing the stream with him.
[1718.78 → 1719.36] So that was great.
[1719.56 → 1719.68] No.
[1719.70 → 1720.06] He's cool.
[1720.14 → 1720.36] Yeah.
[1720.36 → 1720.52] Yeah.
[1720.52 → 1720.58] Yeah.
[1720.82 → 1727.10] I couldn't believe it when he chickened dinnered the one PUBG match that he got to play as part
[1727.10 → 1727.92] of his sponsor thing.
[1728.54 → 1729.06] So like.
[1729.72 → 1730.54] Still though.
[1731.26 → 1732.52] Even if you're perfect.
[1732.56 → 1733.44] He got like eight kills.
[1733.82 → 1734.04] Yeah.
[1734.56 → 1734.88] So.
[1735.02 → 1735.16] So.
[1735.28 → 1735.44] So.
[1735.44 → 1735.72] Okay.
[1735.80 → 1741.46] So what happened was Intel sponsored him to come up here as part of Gamer Days to build
[1741.46 → 1742.36] a PC with me.
[1742.36 → 1744.48] So my commitment was to build a PC for him.
[1744.66 → 1749.12] And then he was supposed to stream for like a few hours after we built the PC.
[1749.66 → 1753.76] Just like from our office here on that PC or the exact same spec.
[1753.86 → 1754.76] But like it was actually.
[1755.20 → 1755.64] Whatever.
[1755.88 → 1755.98] Yeah.
[1756.14 → 1756.28] Yeah.
[1756.60 → 1756.90] Anyway.
[1757.10 → 1758.12] The point is.
[1758.32 → 1759.32] His flight got delayed.
[1759.88 → 1761.94] So we had to throw the machine together.
[1762.22 → 1764.60] We did like a super quick build.
[1765.06 → 1765.66] Like I was cutting.
[1765.80 → 1766.90] Oh like he got here late.
[1767.08 → 1767.42] Yeah.
[1767.42 → 1767.82] Okay.
[1767.92 → 1768.06] Okay.
[1768.10 → 1768.46] Yeah.
[1768.46 → 1772.60] And then he only got to stream for like one round.
[1772.96 → 1774.42] And then the fact that he won it.
[1774.90 → 1775.14] I was.
[1775.40 → 1776.18] When he was on his way out.
[1776.24 → 1776.52] I was like.
[1777.00 → 1777.40] Yeah.
[1779.12 → 1780.38] Way to go man.
[1780.72 → 1781.64] That is pretty cool.
[1781.80 → 1782.38] That's awesome.
[1782.68 → 1783.58] That's freaking awesome.
[1783.66 → 1784.68] You won your first game.
[1784.90 → 1785.24] Didn't you?
[1785.46 → 1786.08] I did.
[1786.24 → 1786.38] Yeah.
[1786.62 → 1787.96] But I didn't kill anyone.
[1788.54 → 1789.34] Still won.
[1789.34 → 1792.40] I had you carrying me.
[1792.82 → 1793.38] And Joe.
[1793.80 → 1794.36] And Joe.
[1794.66 → 1795.44] And then who else did we have?
[1795.44 → 1796.06] Well we had Dennis.
[1796.22 → 1797.06] Someone else was there.
[1797.62 → 1797.82] No.
[1797.82 → 1798.20] I think it was.
[1798.20 → 1799.36] We got Dennis later I think.
[1800.20 → 1800.66] Was it Dennis?
[1800.68 → 1801.42] I think that was Dennis.
[1801.42 → 1801.92] Yeah it was Dennis.
[1802.00 → 1802.50] But Dennis died.
[1802.74 → 1802.98] He just died.
[1803.04 → 1803.24] Yeah.
[1803.34 → 1803.68] Dennis died.
[1803.96 → 1805.22] We just three manned it.
[1806.00 → 1808.08] We had basically a three-man squad.
[1808.22 → 1808.98] Now to be clear.
[1809.08 → 1810.14] Just because I didn't kill anyone.
[1810.22 → 1811.16] Doesn't mean I didn't help.
[1811.28 → 1811.84] He did help.
[1812.20 → 1814.16] He actually did a fair amount of damage too.
[1814.16 → 1815.86] Because you were pinging people with the sniper.
[1816.18 → 1818.04] I'm a good helper.
[1818.04 → 1819.22] And I can communicate.
[1819.38 → 1819.98] You were spotting.
[1820.08 → 1820.70] Making calls.
[1820.92 → 1822.54] And hitting people at least once with a sniper.
[1822.74 → 1824.80] Which is like actually a huge help.
[1824.92 → 1826.42] Because you only need to hit them once or twice.
[1826.62 → 1826.80] Just saying.
[1826.90 → 1827.72] Just saying.
[1827.84 → 1828.42] Not that bad.
[1828.90 → 1830.10] Speaking of not that bad.
[1830.18 → 1831.16] We should talk about our sponsors.
[1832.00 → 1833.26] Because they're not that bad.
[1833.36 → 1833.56] Yeah.
[1833.72 → 1834.02] Yeah.
[1835.72 → 1836.52] Meanwhile like.
[1837.10 → 1839.46] Poor Word watches here.
[1839.88 → 1840.46] Is like.
[1841.16 → 1841.56] Really?
[1842.52 → 1844.94] Clearly they've never sponsored Linus Tech Tips before.
[1844.94 → 1848.34] So these are handcrafted.
[1848.88 → 1852.52] Using sustainably sourced hardwoods from around the world.
[1853.50 → 1854.12] So Word.
[1854.28 → 1855.20] I'm glad I'm saying Word.
[1855.24 → 1855.98] Because they're Swedish.
[1856.10 → 1856.52] That's good.
[1856.94 → 1858.58] Word is Swedish for earth.
[1858.88 → 1860.94] Which is where they draw their inspiration from.
[1861.18 → 1862.88] So they have designs for men and women.
[1863.26 → 1865.42] They have battery or automatic power.
[1865.64 → 1866.76] They use quartz movement.
[1867.44 → 1869.58] And they have something for everyone.
[1869.68 → 1872.30] Now this one needs to be adjusted to be the right size for me.
[1872.92 → 1875.02] But here I can give you guys a look at that.
[1875.10 → 1875.66] Check that out.
[1878.60 → 1879.04] That's a.
[1879.18 → 1880.18] I like the square one better.
[1880.58 → 1880.84] Really?
[1881.04 → 1881.32] Yeah.
[1881.36 → 1881.88] What do you think?
[1883.76 → 1884.54] I like mine.
[1884.60 → 1885.60] But I see why you like yours.
[1885.66 → 1886.38] Well you know what's funny.
[1886.48 → 1889.72] They actually picked out designs specifically for us.
[1889.78 → 1890.86] I think that worked out pretty well.
[1890.86 → 1892.76] Which is actually pretty cool.
[1893.40 → 1894.40] So the whole thing.
[1894.42 → 1895.20] That's a really nice watch.
[1895.20 → 1896.36] So it comes with extra links.
[1897.08 → 1897.42] This is.
[1897.56 → 1898.52] I don't generally.
[1898.70 → 1900.34] I'm not a stylish kind of guy.
[1900.34 → 1901.22] No.
[1901.42 → 1903.18] I don't think either of us really are.
[1903.96 → 1904.64] But like.
[1905.02 → 1905.60] I wish.
[1905.70 → 1907.32] I wish it had one link out of it.
[1907.44 → 1908.00] Because then it would.
[1908.10 → 1909.18] Then it would fit perfectly.
[1909.60 → 1911.90] But that looks really sharp.
[1913.22 → 1915.18] So they do free worldwide shipping.
[1916.34 → 1917.58] The one that I'm wearing.
[1917.58 → 1918.34] I got mine pretty good.
[1918.46 → 1919.44] The Delmar series.
[1919.58 → 1921.06] So that's a dark sandalwood.
[1921.06 → 1922.76] With an obsidian carbon watch face.
[1922.94 → 1924.56] So you can actually see the.
[1924.56 → 1925.32] Like the carbon.
[1925.52 → 1926.96] The carbon fibre finish on there.
[1926.96 → 1928.22] Looks really nice.
[1928.58 → 1930.32] And then Luke's is in a dark sandalwood.
[1930.40 → 1931.48] This is the Frankie series.
[1931.48 → 1933.02] With an emerald watch face.
[1933.22 → 1935.22] So if you guys use offer code LTT.
[1936.12 → 1937.50] Oh the box is magnetic.
[1938.28 → 1939.02] Oh jeez.
[1939.54 → 1940.10] So fancy.
[1940.10 → 1940.50] Of course it is.
[1940.80 → 1942.16] If you use offer code LTT.
[1942.30 → 1943.68] You'll get $25 off.
[1943.78 → 1944.70] And a free sizing.
[1944.84 → 1946.68] At yordwatches.com
[1946.68 → 1947.52] We're going to have that.
[1947.70 → 1948.94] Linked in the video description.
[1949.96 → 1950.42] Oh man.
[1950.52 → 1950.84] I want to.
[1950.88 → 1951.02] Yeah.
[1951.06 → 1951.86] I want to get this.
[1951.90 → 1953.22] I want to get this sized.
[1953.36 → 1953.60] And then.
[1953.60 → 1955.02] Like this is the kind of thing.
[1955.16 → 1956.10] That I could, actually.
[1956.64 → 1958.08] The clasp is fascinating.
[1958.08 → 1959.06] If I went out somewhere nice.
[1959.20 → 1959.30] Do you have the same thing?
[1959.48 → 1959.72] Yeah.
[1959.86 → 1960.14] No, no.
[1960.20 → 1960.72] Mine's different.
[1960.84 → 1961.06] Oh.
[1961.44 → 1963.08] I think I've seen that style before.
[1963.10 → 1964.54] Mine goes in both directions.
[1965.90 → 1966.14] Oh.
[1966.38 → 1966.68] Oh.
[1966.84 → 1967.08] Oh.
[1967.52 → 1967.88] Yeah.
[1968.06 → 1968.24] Oh.
[1968.24 → 1969.84] Which makes it actually way easier to put on.
[1969.84 → 1970.80] For if you have big hands.
[1971.04 → 1973.36] But they didn't feel that I needed that I guess.
[1975.64 → 1977.16] Oh birdwatchers.
[1977.92 → 1978.68] Thanks guys.
[1979.30 → 1980.02] You guys are.
[1980.30 → 1980.72] I'm going to.
[1980.72 → 1981.70] I'm going to keep that safe.
[1981.78 → 1982.84] I'm going to have to deal with that later.
[1983.68 → 1984.20] All right.
[1984.62 → 1985.50] Other sponsor.
[1986.98 → 1988.22] Did I just get burned?
[1988.96 → 1991.64] Did I just get burned by a first time sponsor?
[1992.12 → 1994.02] They picked my sizing like perfectly.
[1996.36 → 1997.24] Spectrum glasses.
[1998.62 → 1999.12] All right.
[1999.68 → 2000.30] Mystery meat.
[2000.38 → 2001.00] Which one do you want?
[2001.44 → 2001.60] That.
[2002.60 → 2002.82] Yeah.
[2003.42 → 2003.62] Perfect.
[2003.78 → 2005.46] That was me picking essentially.
[2005.60 → 2008.40] I actually didn't really look that carefully at which one was in there.
[2008.40 → 2008.96] These are like the.
[2008.96 → 2010.10] I think that's the small one.
[2010.16 → 2011.42] I think that's the one that's better for me.
[2011.48 → 2012.02] But you know what?
[2012.02 → 2014.52] I'm going to wear the bolder frames today.
[2014.98 → 2016.66] Because the point of Spectrum.
[2016.76 → 2018.10] Just because they look good.
[2018.40 → 2022.60] Doesn't mean that that's necessarily why you would run out and buy Spectrum glasses.
[2022.80 → 2024.94] Staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes.
[2025.14 → 2026.96] And also make it tougher to fall asleep.
[2027.08 → 2030.52] So Spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at a computer screen.
[2030.90 → 2033.18] Instead of using a software one like Flux.
[2033.24 → 2035.86] Which doesn't offer the same kind of filtering that these glasses do.
[2036.32 → 2037.22] So they're high quality.
[2037.22 → 2038.44] They come with a one-year warranty.
[2038.58 → 2039.46] The glasses are durable.
[2039.66 → 2041.62] They've got a ton of different styles.
[2041.68 → 2042.66] Including ones for kids.
[2042.86 → 2044.26] They have low colour distortion.
[2044.44 → 2046.82] So they don't just turn your entire world year in yellow.
[2046.92 → 2047.62] Which is nice.
[2047.80 → 2049.60] But they block high energy blue light.
[2049.80 → 2052.78] And while they're primarily focused around the Canadian US markets.
[2053.02 → 2054.60] They do ship internationally.
[2054.94 → 2057.36] So go check them out at spectrumglasses.com.
[2057.46 → 2058.24] Slash collections.
[2058.72 → 2059.96] Slash products.
[2059.96 → 2060.16] Slash products.
[2060.54 → 2061.46] And finally.
[2062.26 → 2063.36] An oldie but a goodie.
[2063.84 → 2064.60] Savage jerky.
[2064.60 → 2065.26] Oh there we go.
[2067.66 → 2068.54] You know what?
[2068.62 → 2069.82] I'm bussing out today.
[2069.98 → 2071.34] I'm just going to eat some original.
[2071.56 → 2072.60] Because I like original.
[2072.84 → 2073.48] I'm going to chill.
[2073.60 → 2074.64] You can eat whatever you want.
[2074.72 → 2076.48] The reapers here from last week.
[2078.46 → 2081.26] Oh was it Riley that I had on who tried the reaper?
[2081.70 → 2082.28] How did he do?
[2082.94 → 2083.38] Good.
[2083.70 → 2084.04] Oh okay.
[2084.08 → 2085.66] Good but it was spicy.
[2085.98 → 2086.52] Yeah yeah yeah.
[2086.52 → 2087.68] Yeah I think it was Riley.
[2087.68 → 2089.32] I had someone on a little while ago.
[2090.16 → 2090.98] Jon's hovering.
[2091.36 → 2092.94] Do you have something to tell us Jon?
[2093.46 → 2094.58] Uh Word giveaway.
[2095.28 → 2096.10] Word's doing a giveaway?
[2096.36 → 2096.56] Yeah.
[2096.88 → 2097.12] Oh.
[2097.44 → 2097.92] Alright.
[2098.24 → 2100.84] Well I'll get back to that once I tell you guys about Savage Jerky.
[2101.46 → 2104.00] I always salivate when I'm opening up the bag.
[2104.10 → 2104.42] Me too.
[2105.02 → 2108.80] Their jerky is made with high quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[2109.22 → 2113.10] The goal is to create a snack that's full of flavour and spice that isn't bad for you.
[2113.86 → 2117.50] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky like sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[2117.50 → 2118.76] Which is my personal favourite.
[2118.76 → 2120.20] The mojo is also great.
[2121.10 → 2122.60] The original is good if you're bland.
[2123.58 → 2124.64] But like it's good.
[2125.50 → 2126.90] They also make...
[2126.90 → 2128.78] Oh man have you tried their hot sauce?
[2129.96 → 2130.22] No.
[2130.72 → 2131.04] Okay.
[2131.90 → 2133.04] You took it home, didn't you?
[2133.34 → 2133.68] Yeah.
[2134.56 → 2135.38] It's perfect.
[2135.46 → 2136.34] How would I have tried it?
[2136.40 → 2137.04] Well I don't know.
[2137.54 → 2138.44] Oh no I guess I did.
[2138.88 → 2139.20] Did you?
[2139.28 → 2140.26] We did the finger dab thing.
[2140.50 → 2141.06] Oh that's right.
[2141.16 → 2141.34] Yeah.
[2141.34 → 2141.70] Yeah.
[2141.70 → 2141.74] Yeah.
[2143.04 → 2144.76] It is as good as I expected.
[2145.48 → 2147.00] It's like freaking awesome.
[2147.16 → 2149.40] So to be clear I'm not being down on the jerky.
[2149.80 → 2152.12] But the hot sauce is perfect.
[2152.16 → 2154.00] If you want to buy one thing from Savage Jerky.
[2154.06 → 2156.22] I haven't actually tried the spice rub or the barbecue sauce.
[2156.62 → 2158.52] But if you want to buy one thing from Savage Jerky.
[2159.00 → 2159.86] Get the hot sauce.
[2160.00 → 2160.68] It was the...
[2160.68 → 2161.12] Interesting.
[2161.12 → 2162.52] I think it was the Reaper hot sauce.
[2163.18 → 2165.88] That I have in my fridge right now.
[2166.06 → 2167.36] It is so good.
[2168.22 → 2169.32] Don't use a ton.
[2170.68 → 2173.42] But the flavour that it adds is really nice.
[2173.74 → 2178.36] So you guys can use offer code LTT to save 10% at SavageJerky.com.
[2179.42 → 2180.50] What can I do for you?
[2181.70 → 2182.10] Nice.
[2182.48 → 2183.12] You're my favourite.
[2183.12 → 2183.84] What are you doing?
[2185.00 → 2186.36] Have you been reading us from Chats?
[2186.68 → 2187.28] Super Chats?
[2187.40 → 2187.54] Yeah.
[2187.72 → 2188.88] Do we have Super Chats?
[2189.30 → 2190.52] Yeah you're streaming on YouTube.
[2190.52 → 2191.68] Oh that's right.
[2191.74 → 2192.46] We're streaming on YouTube.
[2192.60 → 2192.96] I forgot.
[2194.26 → 2197.54] So do we read Super Chats, but we don't read Twitch stuff?
[2197.90 → 2198.38] So the...
[2198.38 → 2199.32] Well no.
[2199.74 → 2202.02] We don't read Super Chats because I completely forgot.
[2202.36 → 2203.04] So there's that.
[2203.50 → 2204.80] We don't really have a policy.
[2207.42 → 2209.40] These are fake by the way.
[2209.48 → 2210.60] But they're like...
[2210.60 → 2212.44] They're the okay kind of fake.
[2213.40 → 2214.32] What does that mean?
[2214.82 → 2215.74] It's a long story.
[2215.98 → 2219.72] But like you can get in trouble for having fake money that is too real.
[2219.72 → 2220.72] Oh.
[2220.88 → 2222.18] So those are like fake enough?
[2222.30 → 2222.48] Yeah.
[2223.02 → 2224.52] So Word Watches has a giveaway.
[2224.94 → 2229.84] Check it out over at www.yordwatches.com slash g slash LTT.
[2230.40 → 2233.76] Which actually gets us perfectly into our next segment here.
[2235.96 → 2238.16] Which I'm not even sure if it's a topic this week.
[2238.16 → 2238.58] What do you even want?
[2238.58 → 2238.76] Oh.
[2240.46 → 2240.82] Yeah.
[2240.90 → 2241.54] I don't think it's a topic.
[2241.54 → 2243.14] What is his dedication to keeping the office clean?
[2243.24 → 2243.52] I know.
[2243.60 → 2244.16] He's like doing the worm.
[2244.16 → 2244.94] You guys can't see it.
[2244.98 → 2246.30] But he's prone on the ground.
[2246.46 → 2246.64] Yeah.
[2247.22 → 2248.48] It's actually kind of embarrassing.
[2248.76 → 2249.66] I'm embarrassed for him.
[2250.40 → 2251.32] I'm proud of him.
[2251.66 → 2252.82] Did you read the Super Chats yet?
[2253.42 → 2253.74] No.
[2256.62 → 2257.72] So this is great.
[2258.80 → 2259.16] Chrome.
[2259.24 → 2259.58] Hold on.
[2259.62 → 2259.88] Hold on.
[2259.98 → 2260.58] Someone in chat.
[2260.84 → 2262.28] Where do I get my RTX on shirt?
[2263.32 → 2263.54] Oh.
[2265.46 → 2267.14] Design by humans.
[2267.38 → 2267.70] LTT.
[2267.86 → 2268.66] I'll post it in the chat.
[2269.52 → 2269.84] Oh, wait.
[2269.96 → 2270.32] LTT.
[2270.56 → 2271.78] I guess I should probably put Linus Tech.
[2271.80 → 2271.94] No.
[2272.02 → 2272.28] Here it is.
[2272.32 → 2272.44] Yeah.
[2272.48 → 2272.86] It's the first chat.
[2272.86 → 2275.64] If you just Google Design by Humans Linus Tech Tips, you'll find it.
[2275.76 → 2275.90] Yeah.
[2275.94 → 2276.20] It's fine.
[2276.26 → 2276.68] I got it.
[2276.68 → 2277.00] I got it.
[2277.00 → 2277.54] I'll throw it in the chat.
[2277.60 → 2278.04] I'll throw it in the chat.
[2278.08 → 2278.20] Cool.
[2278.94 → 2279.06] Oh.
[2279.24 → 2279.50] Right.
[2279.58 → 2280.02] Two chats.
[2280.18 → 2280.66] Oh, Lord.
[2281.32 → 2282.60] Well, there it is in Twitch chat.
[2283.30 → 2283.64] Uh-oh.
[2284.60 → 2285.68] I'm a bad YouTuber.
[2286.24 → 2286.60] Officially.
[2286.98 → 2290.00] Officially 10 out of 10 bad YouTuber.
[2290.16 → 2293.12] Because I completely forgot that we were even streaming on YouTube.
[2293.24 → 2294.22] I streamed earlier on YouTube.
[2294.42 → 2296.02] So, you know, I got that going for me.
[2296.80 → 2297.86] I can't even find it.
[2298.30 → 2300.20] I don't even see the stream here in the thing.
[2300.32 → 2306.56] Someone in the super chat says, I wonder if LTT YouTube channel going to do the community
[2306.56 → 2309.50] join thing, like with the join button on channel.
[2310.00 → 2310.24] Oof.
[2310.82 → 2312.34] That is a great question.
[2312.54 → 2314.26] And one that I would love to answer for you.
[2314.32 → 2314.78] Give me a moment.
[2314.90 → 2316.12] I'm just going to post that thing there.
[2316.32 → 2316.76] Yes.
[2317.32 → 2317.52] There.
[2318.02 → 2318.94] So, we are.
[2319.56 → 2322.26] But, Float plane is not going away.
[2322.44 → 2325.52] So, this is something that Luke and me, I think, talked about on the WAN show a little
[2325.52 → 2326.08] while ago.
[2326.48 → 2331.08] When we were both kind of independently having huge freakouts.
[2331.30 → 2333.62] And then together having a huge breakout.
[2334.06 → 2337.22] And then realized that it's not actually a big deal.
[2337.58 → 2337.82] Yeah.
[2337.82 → 2340.98] Because the whole, I forget what it's called.
[2341.16 → 2341.60] Supporter?
[2342.90 → 2343.34] Contributor?
[2343.54 → 2343.94] Sponsor?
[2343.94 → 2343.96] Sponsor?
[2343.96 → 2345.58] I forget what it's called when someone.
[2345.68 → 2346.50] I think it's called sponsor.
[2346.60 → 2347.48] Clicks that button.
[2347.82 → 2349.38] But basically, it's like a Twitch.
[2349.62 → 2350.74] It's like a Twitch sub.
[2351.38 → 2353.26] The button is titled Join.
[2353.54 → 2353.92] Is it?
[2354.06 → 2354.28] Okay.
[2354.44 → 2354.92] Join.
[2355.12 → 2356.10] It's a Join button.
[2356.34 → 2357.44] But I don't remember what you become.
[2357.50 → 2360.48] So, when someone does that, they pay money.
[2360.78 → 2362.34] And it helps support the creator.
[2362.58 → 2364.58] And also gives some money to Google.
[2365.38 → 2368.94] And other than that, I think you get some emojis.
[2369.40 → 2371.84] But there's not a ton of tangible benefits.
[2372.04 → 2373.00] So, there's no early access.
[2373.74 → 2378.96] So, already, right out of the gate, it doesn't compete with Float plane's.
[2379.52 → 2383.86] Well, what we consider to be at least one of Float plane's sort of dominant features
[2383.86 → 2385.28] is early access to video.
[2385.96 → 2388.38] So, there you go.
[2389.34 → 2391.56] There's not actually as much overlap as you might think.
[2392.04 → 2397.66] And two, the way that we see it, both for supporters and for creators,
[2398.02 → 2402.24] there is always going to be the people who wouldn't go off platform.
[2402.66 → 2405.36] Like, just have no interest in leaving YouTube.com.
[2405.78 → 2408.58] And do want to support Linus Media Group.
[2408.86 → 2410.42] But they want to do it on YouTube.com.
[2410.56 → 2411.60] There's always going to be those people.
[2411.60 → 2415.74] And then there's always going to be the people that don't want to give Google a dollar.
[2416.24 → 2417.12] They'll turn on AdBlock.
[2417.56 → 2421.98] They will refuse any kind of contribution that gives Google a cut.
[2422.68 → 2426.36] And for those people, there's always going to have to be a third-party option.
[2426.68 → 2430.08] And we see ourselves, especially in the direction that we're going right now,
[2430.20 → 2433.82] as being able to be a very strong third-party option.
[2433.82 → 2440.90] So, life is not as simple as this one or this one.
[2441.22 → 2441.94] Why not both?
[2442.10 → 2443.46] Maybe they could just coexist.
[2443.72 → 2446.48] I mean, we always said we're not a YouTube competitor.
[2447.04 → 2447.92] And that's true.
[2448.12 → 2451.12] So, we're just going to have to keep not being a YouTube competitor.
[2451.12 → 2456.66] And I guess I'm speaking as float plane media Linus right now,
[2456.76 → 2459.58] as opposed to YouTuber Linus Media Group Linus.
[2459.76 → 2461.70] But then from Linus Media Group's perspective,
[2462.04 → 2465.74] we have always been all about diversification.
[2466.26 → 2468.10] That's why we joined Vessel.
[2468.46 → 2471.12] That's why we started LinusTechTips.com forum.
[2471.86 → 2477.86] That's why we reached out to partners directly to bake sponsorships into our videos,
[2477.86 → 2479.96] rather than being entirely dependent on AdSense,
[2480.00 → 2483.48] because we don't want to be completely reliant on Google.
[2483.56 → 2489.52] Because Google is actually, they're on a bit of a run right now towards us,
[2489.54 → 2491.88] because I know other creators have had some issues with them.
[2492.08 → 2494.90] But for us, they're on a bit of a run right now
[2494.90 → 2497.16] where they've been actually supporting us really well.
[2497.16 → 2503.14] But the thing is that you can't necessarily count on that lasting forever.
[2503.98 → 2507.46] Because we've had situations where there was no communication from Google,
[2507.54 → 2509.06] and all of a sudden there are these guidelines
[2509.06 → 2513.64] for how they're not going to allow you to have sponsors built into your content anymore,
[2513.64 → 2516.16] unless you adhere to all these weird rules,
[2516.24 → 2518.64] like you can't show any logos in your video.
[2519.18 → 2521.80] That was awkward, trying to explain to someone like Squarespace,
[2522.04 → 2523.74] yeah, we can talk about your service,
[2523.90 → 2526.50] and we can have our site be built with Squarespace,
[2526.50 → 2528.66] and we can say, you know, we love Squarespace,
[2528.94 → 2530.08] and it's really cool,
[2530.58 → 2532.52] but we can't show your logo on screen.
[2532.60 → 2533.20] They'd be like, what?
[2533.96 → 2537.02] And you'd be like, well, so the issue is that if we do that,
[2537.08 → 2542.08] then you have to buy through Google all the advertising on that video,
[2542.34 → 2543.84] but then I don't know how that works,
[2543.86 → 2545.56] because you can't buy it perpetually.
[2545.76 → 2547.48] They don't even have a system for that.
[2547.60 → 2547.70] Yeah.
[2547.84 → 2549.64] But what could you possibly have been thinking?
[2549.76 → 2552.10] So stuff like that has happened in the past.
[2552.10 → 2554.64] So that's why.
[2555.58 → 2558.96] Someone wants to know if we can add a manual monthly fee in Float plane.
[2559.12 → 2563.28] I mean, okay, so actually, from the outside,
[2563.40 → 2567.18] it has appeared as though Float plane hasn't changed much in the last four to six weeks.
[2567.18 → 2570.48] But Luke and I actually had a perfect meeting yesterday,
[2570.48 → 2576.70] and there's going to be some big updates coming hopefully next week, right?
[2577.12 → 2577.30] Yeah.
[2577.82 → 2581.14] So theoretically, we're pushing the most important,
[2581.26 → 2584.70] but probably the hardest to tell one on Monday,
[2584.90 → 2587.62] and then there's more stuff coming right after that.
[2587.72 → 2587.82] Yeah.
[2587.82 → 2592.64] So expect to see new features actually happening over the next little bit.
[2594.98 → 2595.46] Let's see.
[2595.54 → 2598.14] Should we do another topic, or should I talk about a lot of the questions?
[2598.24 → 2599.26] Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[2599.62 → 2604.34] Because I was saying, speaking of WWW, Chrome is like killing WWW.
[2605.18 → 2605.54] Yeah.
[2606.16 → 2608.86] I don't think it's one of our actual topics in here this week,
[2609.12 → 2613.04] and so you'll have to forgive me for not having a ton of background on it,
[2613.12 → 2614.70] but I thought that was interesting.
[2614.70 → 2619.64] Because technically, there's no reason why linustechtips.com
[2619.64 → 2625.12] and www.linustechtips.com had to be the same thing in the past.
[2625.80 → 2631.32] It just happened that out of convenience and out of sort of convention and habit,
[2631.86 → 2636.48] generally speaking, webmasters tried to make them the same thing
[2636.48 → 2640.00] because consumers are lazy, and they don't want to type WWW. Every time.
[2640.46 → 2643.86] But Google is actually formalizing this whole thing,
[2643.86 → 2649.80] which from the perspective of some security sort of minded individuals,
[2649.80 → 2651.80] could be a problem.
[2652.24 → 2652.42] Yeah.
[2652.42 → 2658.08] Because all of a sudden, it could be a way for you to hijack someone
[2658.08 → 2661.24] who otherwise would have intended to go to a different site.
[2661.24 → 2664.74] So maybe you can explain in more detail how the crap that would work.
[2664.88 → 2667.72] Well, right now, I'm not entirely sure.
[2667.90 → 2669.50] And usually, I'd have some angle for this,
[2669.56 → 2671.26] but I've actually read a few threads on it,
[2671.30 → 2674.60] and there's a lot of people debating each other on how exactly it's going to work.
[2675.30 → 2677.66] So I don't want to speak to it too much.
[2677.72 → 2680.82] If you are interested in it, there's a lot of people talking about it,
[2680.90 → 2682.94] and you can definitely find threads out there on your own.
[2682.94 → 2691.08] But, yeah, it gets pretty weird because there's one camp where they're talking about,
[2691.28 → 2696.42] like, well, I don't remember how that was supposed to work,
[2696.50 → 2703.52] but, like, subdominant PayPal onto things can maybe make it look like you're somewhere else.
[2704.20 → 2708.66] And, like, yeah, there's some weird stuff that you might be able to do with it.
[2708.66 → 2714.26] Basically, right now, it's an unknown, and that's terrifying from a web security perspective,
[2714.80 → 2718.26] especially because this change feels very unnecessary.
[2718.62 → 2723.52] Well, I think, honestly, I think the vast majority of it or all of it is known.
[2723.92 → 2728.36] I think the implications of it are a little confusing and hard to understand,
[2728.88 → 2733.00] and a lot of people are talking about it when not a lot of people understand what's actually happening.
[2734.06 → 2735.44] This is a great super chat.
[2735.86 → 2736.30] BULB.
[2736.64 → 2737.74] Yo, I'm late to the show.
[2737.74 → 2738.46] What are the specs?
[2738.46 → 2739.42] Core Clock, Memory Clock.
[2739.52 → 2740.06] Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[2740.82 → 2741.82] It'll be archived.
[2741.98 → 2745.68] Also, YouTube live-streaming has a great feature where you can actually rewind it.
[2745.68 → 2747.82] We talked about RTX for the first half of the show.
[2748.58 → 2749.18] Thanks, man.
[2751.06 → 2752.84] Calvin says, thanks for the beanbag chair.
[2753.06 → 2757.44] Is that actually the guy that we just, like, gave a beanbag chair to for no reason?
[2757.56 → 2757.96] I have no idea.
[2757.96 → 2759.28] I can't remember why we did it.
[2760.52 → 2762.76] I just remember being like, oh, yeah, sure, whatever.
[2762.86 → 2763.40] Let's just do it.
[2764.10 → 2765.86] I think we were trying to get rid of it or something.
[2766.04 → 2766.28] Maybe.
[2766.28 → 2770.44] Maybe he, like, paid for it, but, like, it was just a little bit.
[2770.50 → 2771.92] I don't remember exactly what happened.
[2773.12 → 2778.94] Oh, a lot of people were wondering what was up with that weird live stream last night.
[2778.94 → 2783.28] So that was a new YouTube feature called Premieres.
[2783.28 → 2791.52] And what happens with Premieres is that it seems like it hits you guys with a notification early.
[2791.90 → 2797.42] And then you're supposed to come back and watch the video at exactly the moment it goes live.
[2797.50 → 2798.96] And there's a live chat.
[2799.34 → 2801.58] But the video is actually pre-produced.
[2801.72 → 2806.58] So there were a lot of people that seemed to be upset because they were like, this isn't live.
[2806.62 → 2807.46] Pre-recorded.
[2807.72 → 2808.50] Pre-recorded.
[2808.56 → 2809.68] Hashtag pre-recorded.
[2809.68 → 2810.08] Yes.
[2810.64 → 2811.30] It was.
[2811.64 → 2812.58] It's supposed to be pre-recorded.
[2812.64 → 2812.76] Yeah.
[2812.90 → 2818.34] So this is actually a feature that, and Luke and I still have some ideas that are different and could be better.
[2818.52 → 2821.78] But this was actually a feature that we had discussed doing on Floor plane.
[2821.90 → 2822.78] Like two years ago.
[2822.82 → 2823.56] Like two years ago.
[2823.92 → 2825.02] But, Deb takes time.
[2825.16 → 2825.38] Anyway.
[2825.38 → 2830.28] The point is, the idea behind it is that it is a normal video.
[2831.00 → 2833.44] But we schedule when it goes live.
[2833.52 → 2834.88] Now, we often schedule our videos.
[2835.26 → 2840.60] But in this case, we're scheduling it in a way that you guys can see.
[2840.60 → 2851.94] So you'll know exactly when to come back with your popcorn and hang out in the chat and, like, talk, interact live with each other and or me.
[2852.00 → 2855.56] It was actually me and Nick that were both manning the Linus Tech Tips account last night.
[2855.94 → 2860.52] And give commentary on the video as you're watching it, as you're all watching it together.
[2860.52 → 2868.74] And then as soon as that premiere is done, then it just, a switch flips, and it becomes just a normal YouTube video.
[2869.72 → 2870.16] Neat, huh?
[2870.82 → 2871.06] Yeah.
[2873.36 → 2877.30] Andrew asks if I will talk about conservatives being banned from YouTube and Twitter.
[2877.50 → 2881.58] If you're talking specifically about Alex Jones, no, I won't.
[2884.28 → 2885.86] I will not be talking about that.
[2885.98 → 2886.28] Thank you.
[2886.38 → 2886.82] Great question.
[2887.00 → 2888.32] That's a way to get banned on YouTube.
[2890.52 → 2896.10] Oh, here's a question for you.
[2896.34 → 2896.58] Yeah.
[2896.98 → 2902.64] If Alex Jones came to you and said, I want to be on Flow play, what do you say?
[2902.96 → 2903.22] Sure.
[2903.92 → 2904.14] Good.
[2904.86 → 2905.20] Me too.
[2906.80 → 2907.12] So.
[2908.02 → 2909.44] We might want to clarify why.
[2909.54 → 2910.24] Should we clarify why?
[2910.24 → 2916.20] Well, because we don't want to be, we don't want to, really, we just don't.
[2916.28 → 2917.58] We're not even an open platform.
[2917.74 → 2919.50] You would have to pay to go see his content.
[2919.50 → 2926.18] So if you are going to be offended by his content or driven off by his content, don't actively give him money.
[2926.28 → 2927.38] Yeah, don't give him money and you won't see it.
[2927.38 → 2928.00] And you're fine.
[2928.26 → 2931.84] And the other thing too is like, we do draw the line at anything illegal.
[2932.22 → 2937.94] So I know that some people have speculated that he's been banned because of some pending lawsuits or whatever else.
[2937.94 → 2942.70] But that doesn't necessarily mean that the content that he uploaded was illegal.
[2942.80 → 2944.26] I actually don't know that it wasn't.
[2944.60 → 2945.82] Frankly, I haven't looked that much into it.
[2945.82 → 2947.36] I doubt either of us know almost anything about it.
[2947.36 → 2953.88] But until he did something illegal on floatplane.com, then there wouldn't really be a conversation to be had about it.
[2954.42 → 2956.64] I don't know almost anything about him.
[2956.64 → 2961.56] I know some people don't like him and I don't know.
[2961.56 → 2968.86] People are asking, so would you allow denying Sandy Hook on float plane?
[2968.98 → 2969.92] I don't agree with it.
[2970.02 → 2972.06] But as far as I can tell, it's not illegal.
[2973.64 → 2974.48] Don't give him money.
[2974.80 → 2977.58] Yeah, don't give him money would be like the best suggestion.
[2979.34 → 2979.98] All right.
[2979.98 → 2983.66] Is that what he did?
[2983.74 → 2984.94] Is that what everyone's angry about?
[2984.94 → 2986.02] I really know nothing about him.
[2986.02 → 2987.48] Honestly, he's been doing that for years.
[2987.72 → 2990.10] That's just a particularly stupid thing that he's done.
[2990.20 → 2990.34] Yes.
[2990.50 → 2990.94] That's weird.
[2991.14 → 2991.30] Yeah.
[2991.56 → 2993.86] It's a very bizarre thing.
[2993.86 → 2995.42] Now someone in chat said he did not do that.
[2995.70 → 2996.26] See, I don't know.
[2996.60 → 2998.00] I can't keep on top of this stuff.
[2999.58 → 3000.86] I just don't care.
[3002.56 → 3006.36] Oh, do we have to cover the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR?
[3006.36 → 3007.76] Have you kept up with this?
[3007.84 → 3007.96] No.
[3007.96 → 3008.32] Have you seen this?
[3008.38 → 3008.86] Have you heard about this?
[3008.90 → 3009.52] Dude, I've been busy.
[3009.98 → 3011.80] Um, yeah.
[3012.70 → 3014.66] They seem like they're going to be fine.
[3014.74 → 3016.44] Oh, I finally got my iPhone X back.
[3017.04 → 3018.54] Well, it's not that I finally got it back.
[3018.60 → 3019.54] I finally RMA'd it.
[3020.04 → 3020.26] Oh, okay.
[3020.26 → 3022.34] So my face ID has been broken for over six months.
[3022.36 → 3022.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3023.28 → 3026.74] So Apple's RMA process, excellent.
[3027.10 → 3028.36] They send you a prepaid label.
[3028.54 → 3033.62] It appears to be like overnight because I got my new phone back in three days or something
[3033.62 → 3034.36] stupid like that.
[3035.20 → 3036.42] Like doorstep to doorstep.
[3036.42 → 3039.38] And I don't mean like in 72 hours.
[3039.38 → 3043.56] I mean like I shipped it out midday here and got it back at the beginning of the day here.
[3043.64 → 3044.60] Like it's impressive.
[3044.84 → 3045.48] That's pretty crazy.
[3045.84 → 3047.60] Um, so that's, so that's cool.
[3047.72 → 3050.38] So I'll have my iPhone X to compare against it.
[3050.52 → 3054.16] I'm definitely getting, um, both the XS and the XS Max.
[3054.16 → 3057.40] Uh, brand is, uh, is, is working on it.
[3057.78 → 3058.86] So that's cool.
[3058.94 → 3060.10] You guys can expect a review.
[3060.34 → 3061.80] Um, you know, eventually.
[3062.26 → 3066.10] I'm at the point now where, I don't know if you saw the video that went up last night.
[3066.14 → 3067.36] I'm assuming, I'm assuming not.
[3067.42 → 3073.10] But it was about, um, why Google or how Google forced me to make an iPhone XS video.
[3073.10 → 3077.30] So what I had actually wanted to do was the Switch stream that I did today.
[3077.40 → 3078.86] Not Nintendo Switch, network Switch.
[3079.44 → 3079.50] Yeah.
[3079.58 → 3080.90] Um, that's what I had wanted to do.
[3081.02 → 3087.34] Um, but instead I, I decided to make a XS video because, um, over the last three years,
[3087.38 → 3094.20] our lowest point for viewership, like our weeks long the lowest point for viewership was the day
[3094.20 → 3096.34] after Apple announced a new iPhone in September.
[3096.34 → 3100.92] And I've seen people suggest, well, maybe it's because of back to school and that's
[3100.92 → 3107.36] a good hypothesis, but Apple's announcement is as much as a week or 10 days apart.
[3108.04 → 3112.38] So theoretically, if it was because of back to school, it would all happen like when school
[3112.38 → 3112.90] goes back.
[3113.32 → 3116.64] Um, and I don't believe Apple's announcement is directly related to Labour Day.
[3116.72 → 3119.16] Also like school's been in session for a little while here.
[3119.16 → 3119.64] Yeah.
[3119.80 → 3125.54] Um, and basically what I, what I, what I talked about was how you just kind of have to do it
[3125.54 → 3130.52] because as soon as someone watches an iPhone XS video, you know how it is.
[3130.54 → 3133.58] If you watch a tractor video, all of a sudden you've got a bunch of farming videos and you
[3133.58 → 3135.12] feed and all over your homepage and everything.
[3135.30 → 3137.68] So as soon as someone watches an iPhone XS video.
[3137.88 → 3142.68] Dude, I watched a video on some guy mowing a lawn with a like a sickle.
[3143.16 → 3143.40] Yep.
[3144.54 → 3147.74] I didn't know there was that many lawn mowing videos on the internet.
[3147.74 → 3149.58] I just, it wouldn't stop.
[3149.78 → 3155.20] And so what happens is if we don't have a XS video, then the algorithm goes, well, these
[3155.20 → 3156.50] guys are tech, but not Apple.
[3156.86 → 3158.96] And this viewer is tech and Apple.
[3159.12 → 3162.34] And they start to skew the way that they feed them videos.
[3162.98 → 3165.18] And, um, so, so I was like, okay, you know what?
[3165.22 → 3165.50] Screw it.
[3165.62 → 3166.56] I'm just gonna, I don't know, whatever.
[3166.68 → 3168.70] I'm just going to do an iPhone XS video.
[3168.86 → 3170.90] Um, but I don't really feel like talking about it anymore.
[3171.44 → 3174.46] So they're like better and stuff.
[3175.40 → 3178.70] And also there's a XR that has an LCD instead of an OLED.
[3178.96 → 3180.18] Why are there so many different versions?
[3180.18 → 3186.08] Um, well, there's the there's the premium ones, small, big, and then there's the value
[3186.08 → 3186.34] one.
[3187.62 → 3188.80] All of a 10 though?
[3189.52 → 3189.88] 10S.
[3190.08 → 3190.50] 10S.
[3190.52 → 3192.18] Well, two 10Ss and one 10R.
[3192.32 → 3193.58] See, we already got confused.
[3193.62 → 3194.66] And then the 10 goes away.
[3195.28 → 3197.24] So what's been typical in the past.
[3198.14 → 3198.44] Yeah.
[3198.58 → 3199.50] That's, that's a weird one.
[3199.60 → 3199.88] I, okay.
[3199.94 → 3204.46] My, my, my guess, and obviously no one's done teardowns of these yet, but my guess is
[3204.46 → 3211.48] that the 10 is just too expensive to, um, to, to become a like a, a step-down model.
[3212.38 → 3212.74] Right.
[3212.82 → 3214.42] Just the they don't want to manufacture it anymore.
[3214.42 → 3214.54] Yeah.
[3214.54 → 3220.28] Because it's got that dual layer P that sandwich PCB with all the like it looks incredibly
[3220.28 → 3221.36] complex to manufacture.
[3221.62 → 3221.86] Yeah.
[3222.12 → 3223.38] Um, so that, that's my guess.
[3223.38 → 3226.78] I think that's why the 10R came about instead of just keeping the 10.
[3226.78 → 3229.76] I'm sure you've talked about this before, but someone in chat said notch equals ruined.
[3229.86 → 3230.50] What is your thoughts?
[3231.02 → 3231.68] Notch equals what?
[3232.10 → 3232.44] Ruined.
[3232.66 → 3233.72] What are your thoughts on notches?
[3233.72 → 3235.72] Because I don't think I care.
[3235.84 → 3239.98] So I don't mind the notch as long as I can disable it, but it actually does bother me
[3239.98 → 3244.42] if I'm watching a 21 by nine content, if I'm watching widescreen content, and I've got
[3244.42 → 3246.56] a bite out of the screen.
[3246.60 → 3247.62] What do you mean by disable it?
[3247.82 → 3252.08] Um, so one plus, for example, allows you to just chop off the top of the display.
[3252.08 → 3256.20] And as long as you've got an OLED display, those pixels that are off, they're just as
[3256.20 → 3257.54] black as the surrounding glass.
[3257.58 → 3257.76] Yeah.
[3257.82 → 3258.94] So it's just gone.
[3259.48 → 3260.98] If you don't want to notch, just ignore it.
[3260.98 → 3264.36] If you're watching some type of full screen content, it would chop off the notch.
[3264.62 → 3267.24] Because I like the idea of notifications and phone status.
[3267.24 → 3267.82] Not on the iPhone.
[3267.82 → 3268.96] That's garbage.
[3268.96 → 3272.02] Some Android handset makers do that, but not on the iPhone.
[3272.36 → 3275.66] And so like playing a game on an iPhone, there's a fricking notch on the edge.
[3275.66 → 3276.58] That's really stupid.
[3276.72 → 3277.38] It's just ridiculous.
[3277.38 → 3278.44] That's very, very stupid.
[3278.86 → 3281.14] And I don't mind the idea of the notch there.
[3281.18 → 3284.16] If it just has phone status on the right, notifications on the left.
[3284.42 → 3284.74] Cool.
[3284.86 → 3285.00] Yeah.
[3285.00 → 3289.58] If I have so many notifications that they go all the way across, then that's actually
[3289.58 → 3292.40] kind of what I have all the time, but I'm not going to be able to tell what's happening
[3292.40 → 3294.06] from looking at that notification bit anyway.
[3294.16 → 3295.30] So we have to pull it down regardless.
[3295.46 → 3295.98] So I don't care.
[3297.20 → 3300.66] But then all full screen content should just not go up there.
[3301.52 → 3302.24] That's ridiculous.
[3303.70 → 3304.36] Oh boy.
[3304.36 → 3308.04] And that's been the debate over the last year.
[3310.20 → 3310.64] Yeah.
[3310.72 → 3312.00] Oh, this kind of sucks.
[3313.14 → 3317.14] So OnePlus, guys are my bros.
[3320.74 → 3322.04] And all that, Hart.
[3323.66 → 3324.44] But really?
[3325.44 → 3328.32] So OnePlus, it seems, has been confirmed.
[3330.24 → 3331.72] Yeah, looks like this is confirmed.
[3332.00 → 3333.86] OnePlus is removing the headphone jack.
[3335.14 → 3336.74] So what am I going to have left?
[3337.96 → 3338.36] Samsung?
[3340.18 → 3342.80] Is the LG V40 going to have a headphone jack?
[3342.92 → 3344.00] Yeah, LG V40.
[3344.74 → 3345.74] Let's find out.
[3347.60 → 3349.98] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3352.48 → 3353.26] Can't tell.
[3353.90 → 3355.06] The site's loading slowly.
[3356.32 → 3357.30] Looks like it will.
[3357.66 → 3357.90] Okay.
[3358.40 → 3362.34] With their upgraded DAC, so it looks like the LG V40 is going to continue.
[3362.34 → 3363.14] Oh, it's going to have a notch.
[3363.38 → 3363.74] Bloody hell.
[3364.36 → 3367.30] Um, so then, like, that's it.
[3367.80 → 3369.54] Like, I'm not a Samsung fanboy or anything.
[3369.70 → 3373.28] In fact, I put up that video recently talking about the battery drain issues that I've had
[3373.28 → 3373.68] with Samsung.
[3374.06 → 3376.58] Note 9's actually been better lately.
[3376.58 → 3378.64] Um, I'm at 66% today.
[3378.64 → 3378.66] Um, I'm at 66% today.
[3379.08 → 3382.98] Which is about right from when I was using the, uh, Pixel 2 itself.
[3383.82 → 3384.22] Um.
[3384.58 → 3385.82] My phone's brutal right now.
[3385.86 → 3386.58] I need a new phone.
[3387.06 → 3388.22] Yeah, I've hardly touched mine.
[3388.64 → 3391.38] Actually, no, I've, no, I've actually used mine today, and it's at 66.
[3391.68 → 3394.80] My, basically the screen has been off all day.
[3395.20 → 3396.04] Pretty much.
[3396.14 → 3396.72] And it's draining?
[3396.92 → 3397.32] 76.
[3398.20 → 3398.52] Okay.
[3399.06 → 3403.04] I mean, that sounds pretty good to me from the kinds of issues that I've had, but mine's
[3403.04 → 3404.12] behaving well right now.
[3404.24 → 3404.42] So.
[3404.82 → 3408.56] It's a first gen Pixel XL, and I've thrashed it pretty hard over the years.
[3408.58 → 3410.58] But like, what choice am I going to have anymore?
[3411.64 → 3412.42] Word on the street.
[3412.68 → 3413.60] Google's removing it.
[3413.80 → 3414.68] OnePlus is removing it.
[3414.68 → 3416.56] Like OnePlus, I actually had hoped for.
[3416.56 → 3417.88] I thought they were going to be the standout.
[3417.96 → 3421.84] I thought they were going to hold out, but they're somewhat at the mercy of their parent
[3421.84 → 3422.44] company, right?
[3423.14 → 3425.94] Like, they do their own thing in certain ways.
[3426.06 → 3430.00] Like, their oxygen skin, I think, is better than their parent company's skin.
[3430.14 → 3431.72] Just hands down better.
[3432.50 → 3438.96] Um, some stuff they do differently, but because they're kind of a relatively small division,
[3438.96 → 3444.58] um, I think they do have to rely somewhat on the tooling and on the investments of their
[3444.58 → 3445.16] parent company.
[3445.16 → 3450.70] And it looks like that's just becoming the reality in smartphones now is they need that
[3450.70 → 3454.82] extra space, and they'd rather use it for, I think OnePlus's statement said something
[3454.82 → 3458.38] about like more innovative features or something.
[3459.04 → 3461.68] Android phone equals 60% chance to ka boom.
[3461.82 → 3462.60] That's BS.
[3463.66 → 3464.36] What's that?
[3464.36 → 3468.78] Someone in the chat said Android phone equals 60% chance to ka boom.
[3468.96 → 3469.76] And that's just...
[3469.76 → 3470.52] What does that even mean?
[3470.72 → 3474.36] I think he's saying the battery's going to explode 60% of the time, which is just completely
[3474.36 → 3474.60] BS.
[3474.60 → 3475.84] That's just a stupid thing to say.
[3475.90 → 3477.08] That wasn't a super chat, was it?
[3477.30 → 3477.54] No.
[3477.56 → 3478.30] Because that's not super.
[3478.42 → 3479.04] That was from Twitch.
[3479.54 → 3484.44] Um, we got to figure out how we're doing this because there's people that subscribe
[3484.44 → 3485.58] and stuff on the Twitch side.
[3486.92 → 3492.54] And like, we can absolutely have Twitch donations too, but we've never addressed anyone on Twitch.
[3492.54 → 3495.68] Well, I think Twitch is going to, I think Twitch is going to probably boot us at some
[3495.68 → 3497.52] point for dual streaming and being a partner.
[3497.72 → 3498.70] So it might not be an issue.
[3498.96 → 3501.38] I understand.
[3502.08 → 3502.90] That makes sense.
[3504.14 → 3504.78] All right.
[3504.98 → 3505.36] You know what?
[3505.40 → 3508.10] Let's do a couple, let's do a couple super chats towards the end here.
[3508.12 → 3508.92] And then I guess we'll cut it.
[3508.92 → 3513.44] Technically, I did notice in the partner agreement that I signed, it's actually only for gaming.
[3513.84 → 3514.12] Really?
[3514.26 → 3515.48] I wonder if yours might be too.
[3515.62 → 3516.36] Oh, that's interesting.
[3516.40 → 3520.90] I'm allowed to do any form of content on any other streaming platform that isn't gaming.
[3521.34 → 3521.86] Oh, all right.
[3521.86 → 3524.80] Or that is a game that is not allowed on Twitch.
[3524.80 → 3525.80] Okay.
[3525.80 → 3526.80] Yeah.
[3526.80 → 3526.94] Okay.
[3527.36 → 3527.52] Yeah.
[3527.78 → 3532.74] So Kang, what do you think about Apple products getting more and more expensive, yet there's
[3532.74 → 3534.08] less and less innovation involved?
[3534.20 → 3534.38] Okay.
[3534.44 → 3535.60] So first, I disagree.
[3535.60 → 3543.50] Because when a product becomes commoditized, it actually means that in order to try to differentiate,
[3543.88 → 3545.52] you have to be more innovative.
[3546.02 → 3551.94] Going from 14 nanometers down to 10, down to seven just sounds like a linear progression,
[3551.94 → 3554.02] but it actually gets much more difficult.
[3554.02 → 3556.66] So there's just one thing right off the hop.
[3557.12 → 3562.92] Number two is that integrating better hardware that you just get from someone else.
[3563.14 → 3567.88] So you just buy the latest reference design from Qualcomm and you build a chassis around
[3567.88 → 3569.50] it, and you bolt some stuff to it.
[3570.38 → 3572.66] That is relatively easy.
[3572.66 → 3581.52] So designing a GPU from the ground up, building your own OS, your own cloud infrastructure for
[3581.52 → 3587.04] backups, like the kind of stuff that Apple invests in is not innovative.
[3587.54 → 3590.36] It just doesn't seem like it because a lot of it's in the software.
[3591.34 → 3597.04] So I don't agree at all that Google and Apple are not innovating.
[3597.38 → 3600.62] I think it's just in a way that's not as exciting to us hardware geeks.
[3601.42 → 3602.02] That's all.
[3602.66 → 3608.40] It's just in a way that's, that just doesn't float my boat and doesn't float your boat.
[3609.70 → 3613.88] Um, and I think as it gets harder and harder, yeah, it gets more expensive.
[3614.76 → 3619.02] Someone, someone in chat said, dude, you boys are the only reason I'm on Twitch.
[3620.02 → 3623.84] Oh, uh, well, we're still going to be streaming to Twitch until they kick us off.
[3623.94 → 3625.76] And I would also take that almost the other way.
[3625.82 → 3626.74] You can drop a platform.
[3627.74 → 3628.18] Adam.
[3628.18 → 3628.42] Okay.
[3628.50 → 3632.30] Normally I, I don't make a point of calling out how much a super chat donates,
[3632.30 → 3639.38] but Adam put in 20 bucks and then says pre-ordered my iPhone 10 S max.
[3640.08 → 3643.14] That, so Adam clearly can afford the 20 bucks.
[3643.44 → 3645.88] Because the iPhone 10 S max, do you know how much this thing is?
[3646.22 → 3649.48] Uh, in Canada with everything, is it going to be like over two grand?
[3649.68 → 3650.74] For the top end model.
[3650.82 → 3651.02] Yeah.
[3651.02 → 3653.12] Is that the top end model?
[3653.34 → 3654.26] Uh, I don't know.
[3654.48 → 3656.10] Uh, well, no, cause there are different capacities.
[3656.34 → 3657.62] This is the pro, oh, okay.
[3657.68 → 3658.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3658.08 → 3659.92] And Adam says, yes, I have a problem.
[3660.10 → 3660.44] Yeah.
[3660.58 → 3661.12] No kidding.
[3662.00 → 3662.44] Um.
[3662.60 → 3664.46] What's your thoughts on the red phone?
[3666.22 → 3666.84] It's red.
[3667.36 → 3668.08] No, no, no, no, no.
[3668.68 → 3669.74] Oh, which one is this?
[3669.80 → 3670.60] Red company.
[3670.88 → 3671.72] Not red colour.
[3671.88 → 3672.88] Oh, no, I don't know about this.
[3673.84 → 3674.24] What?
[3675.28 → 3676.74] MKBHD has been tweeting photos from it.
[3676.74 → 3677.60] Oh, that red.
[3677.70 → 3678.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3678.34 → 3678.60] Sorry.
[3678.72 → 3678.88] I see.
[3678.94 → 3682.44] I had project red just like stuck in my brain.
[3683.08 → 3683.38] And I was like.
[3683.38 → 3684.34] That's why I said red company.
[3684.36 → 3687.44] Because I know that Apple had a project red phone.
[3688.16 → 3690.60] But like project red now has their own phone.
[3690.68 → 3691.34] That's weird.
[3691.84 → 3692.88] Oh, the red phone.
[3693.20 → 3696.86] So I'm pretty pissed off to be perfectly honest with you.
[3696.94 → 3697.44] You didn't get one?
[3697.66 → 3698.62] Uh, well, I did.
[3698.70 → 3699.48] I ordered one.
[3699.54 → 3700.28] I ordered two.
[3700.70 → 3700.94] Oh.
[3701.34 → 3701.66] Yeah.
[3701.66 → 3703.78] I ordered both SKUs.
[3704.46 → 3710.60] This is a Snapdragon 835 based product that still isn't here.
[3710.60 → 3714.90] And that for some reason, even though I pre-ordered at the same time as anybody else,
[3715.10 → 3717.78] other people are getting exclusive sneak peeks with.
[3718.72 → 3721.00] And I haven't seen hide nor hair of it.
[3721.06 → 3725.30] And the weird, the really stupid thing, like, okay, actually, oh, you know what?
[3725.34 → 3725.54] Okay.
[3725.54 → 3726.86] Let's talk about the red hydrogen one.
[3727.36 → 3731.60] So I got an email from red, and we're actually going to be collaborating with
[3731.60 → 3732.70] red on an upcoming project.
[3732.82 → 3734.34] Hopefully I'm not jeopardizing that right now.
[3734.40 → 3736.34] But if it does, then I guess that is what it is.
[3736.40 → 3742.04] But I got an email from red inviting me to be part of a select few customers who will get
[3742.04 → 3747.42] the hydrogen one early for the purposes of providing beta user feedback, which is not
[3747.42 → 3752.36] inherently a problem except for one key thing.
[3752.36 → 3757.68] I want to make sure that I get this right because it's very important.
[3758.72 → 3759.58] Hydrogen one.
[3759.90 → 3762.56] Following up on your interest about hydrogen one, is this it?
[3762.72 → 3763.02] No.
[3763.02 → 3769.14] They invited me to some event, and I was like, no, I can't make it.
[3771.14 → 3772.06] Where is it?
[3772.56 → 3772.96] Shoot.
[3775.30 → 3776.20] Houdini project.
[3776.78 → 3777.60] Is that what it's called?
[3777.82 → 3778.18] Yes.
[3778.72 → 3779.42] Here we go.
[3780.34 → 3783.16] So I just need to make sure I've got the right email.
[3783.38 → 3783.54] Okay.
[3783.58 → 3785.22] So this is ridiculous.
[3785.22 → 3792.38] So you get the phone early, but you can't talk about it.
[3792.56 → 3798.08] So I was like, well, if I can't review it, I don't want it early because it's not a retail
[3798.08 → 3798.68] unit.
[3799.24 → 3801.12] It is a PVT sample.
[3802.00 → 3805.08] So that is a pre-mass production unit.
[3805.40 → 3810.22] To be very clear, the thing a normal company does with a PVT sample is destroyed it.
[3810.22 → 3818.66] Because it is industry standard, not considered suitable to deliver as a final product to an
[3818.66 → 3818.96] end user.
[3819.36 → 3824.72] Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this if Red's intention was to take beta feedback and
[3824.72 → 3829.66] then take your PVT back and send you an MP unit, but they are not.
[3830.72 → 3839.24] What you are agreeing to is that you will not get a mass production unit.
[3839.24 → 3842.56] And this is for a phone that you paid $1,000 for or whatever.
[3843.76 → 3845.58] Is that not ridiculous?
[3846.08 → 3850.96] So the terms and conditions of this Houdini project were just utterly ridiculous to me.
[3851.04 → 3852.58] I already read one insane thing.
[3852.92 → 3853.14] Yeah.
[3853.64 → 3858.86] So I do intend to talk about that in my Hydrogen One review video.
[3858.86 → 3860.94] Good, because that one line that I read is ridiculous.
[3860.94 → 3862.62] Because that is not the way you do business.
[3863.32 → 3864.10] So anyway.
[3864.62 → 3867.96] On that note, thank you for watching The Land Show, and we will see you again next week.
[3867.96 → 3870.00] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3870.52 → 3871.04] Oh, wait.
[3871.82 → 3872.32] Um.
[3872.42 → 3872.68] Whoa.
[3873.18 → 3875.18] What the heck?
[3876.16 → 3878.54] Someone just sent a $200 super chat.
[3878.66 → 3879.34] I blur.
[3880.12 → 3883.76] Saw Dennis's dirty apartment in your recent gaming upgrade vid.
[3883.76 → 3889.12] Please use this $200 to buy him a few hours with a cleaning service.
[3889.68 → 3892.04] And record the nastiness for channel super fun.
[3892.10 → 3892.64] I can't.
[3892.88 → 3895.08] We can't do something like that.
[3895.16 → 3899.50] I mean, we honestly almost got him in trouble with his landlord filming in there at all.
[3899.82 → 3900.04] What?
[3900.60 → 3901.58] It's a whole thing.
[3902.00 → 3902.40] Um.
[3902.70 → 3903.52] Don't worry about it.
[3903.52 → 3905.02] But, um.
[3905.02 → 3907.44] Okay.
[3908.20 → 3909.08] That's awkward.
[3909.60 → 3910.08] Um.
[3911.86 → 3913.94] Thank you everyone for watching.
[3914.30 → 3916.28] Damon, Michael, Mitchell, and I blur.
[3916.38 → 3917.92] You guys are very nice people.
[3918.24 → 3921.64] How do I, how do I get myself out of this nicely?
[3921.80 → 3922.56] Oh, show's over.
[3922.56 → 3936.48] Our conversation is billiards.
[3936.48 → 3937.80] If you did, you're feeling both.
[3937.92 → 3938.40] Then, uh, we'll be out.
[3938.42 → 3938.98] Bye.
[3938.98 → 3939.98] Bye.
[3940.78 → 3941.90] Bye.
[3942.72 → 3943.52] Bye.
[3948.26 → 3948.80] Bye.
[3950.42 → 3952.38] Bye.
