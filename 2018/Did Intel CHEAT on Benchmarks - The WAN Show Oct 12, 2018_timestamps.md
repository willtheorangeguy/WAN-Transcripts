[2018-10-13T15:46:27Z] Video: Did Intel CHEAT on Benchmarks?? - The WAN Show Oct 12, 2018 
Nearly every comments is about Linus being an Intel shill... Yet he clearly said the right things. Did you even WATCH the video? Here, have a bunch of timestamps with everything he said on that subject:
- 44:06 to 44:40 You shouldn't pre-order products that haven't been independently evaluated by third parties,
- 45:35 to 45:45 AMD system using stock cooler really doesn't matter. AMD stock cooler is MUCH better than Intel's stock crap, it wouldn't throttle itself with that. Even if the case is garbage.
- 45:46 to 46:10 Linus Bash PT at about how anyone who knows anything about benchmarking should've known not to enable GameMode.
- 46:10 to 47:05 Linus explains why companies contract "third parties" to evaluate their products.
- 47:10 to 48:25 We don't know if PT and Intel did this out of malice, which is true. No one knows. That pre-order sales of CPUs is negligible, it's not a game afterall, it's hardware, not many people pre-order hardware. 
- 48:26 to 48:57  Linus shows his insight of things from when he worked at NCIX about hardware launch. It's not about pre-order, the money to be made is after launch.
- 48:57 to 49:45 Malice or Incompetence? Intel might not be able to deal with the demand and run out of stock.
- 49:46 to 50:05  Intel had to know this was going to come back and bite them in the ass. Hence adding fuel to the Incompetence side of things.
- 50:05 to 51:19 Linus doesn't understand why anyone, consumers or techfolks, paid any attention to paid numbers in the first place. Which is correct, even AMD did the same crap, yet we've ignored them and waited for actual reviews. Not any different than what Intel has done in the past either.
- 51:20 to 52:18 IT'S MARKETING FLUFF. Why are "we" making a fuss over this when no on complained about every other marketing fluff in the past. Where every reviewers look at the numbers, think they are ridiculous and warn people, but noooo we just had to make a witch hunt out of it.
- 52:19 to 53:14 You should wait for independent reviews and then cross reference them to see if there's an anomaly or not. Mistake can also happens when reviewing. Even LTT made mistakes.(as we know)
- 53:15 to 53:57 the testing methodology was flawed, didn't list GTA5 settings and what not. They may not be educated on how to review stuff. Intel choose poorly who to contract for this and Intel is not blameless in this, as Linus said.
- 53:57 to 54:40 The argument Linus is making and that Luke agree on, is that it doesn't matter. You should be mad when manufacturer mislead you. But this particular instance isn't any different than what Intel, AMD and Nvidia showed in the past. 
- 54:41 to 55:05 Remember Game Mode that Microsoft was shilling hard It did nothing. It was useless. The community said it would be fixed overtime. Linus gets a video idea to see if it did get fixed over time.
- 55:07 to 55:20 we should always take manufacturers claim with a grain a salt, that's the lesson here. End of that part of the show, people in the comments are insane.
