[0.00 --> 2.00]  .text
[2.00 --> 4.00]  And...
[4.00 --> 6.00]  Yeah, we're live.
[6.00 --> 10.00]  Yay! It's the WED show!
[10.00 --> 14.00]  Confirm live dot box or something. Oh man.
[14.00 --> 16.00]  Yeah, our OBS is still
[16.00 --> 18.00]  super duper broken.
[18.00 --> 22.00]  But, it seems like our audio levels are okay.
[22.00 --> 26.00]  Yeah. So I think we are in pretty good shape to just
[26.00 --> 28.00]  power on through there.
[28.00 --> 32.00]  And the live chat is amazed that we're on time.
[32.00 --> 36.00]  There's even some expletives. That's how surprised they are.
[36.00 --> 40.00]  You know who you have to thank for us being on time today?
[40.00 --> 44.00]  Who do we give credit? Samsung or Colton? Both.
[44.00 --> 46.00]  Oh. Both.
[46.00 --> 48.00]  Let's give both Samsung and Colton credit.
[48.00 --> 52.00]  So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today. T-Mobile was
[52.00 --> 56.00]  sued after cryptocurrency theft.
[56.00 --> 60.00]  Yeah. Office 2019 is only going to run on Windows 10
[60.00 --> 62.00]  apparently. Oh no!
[62.00 --> 64.00]  Although, does this one include the...
[64.00 --> 66.00]  Could you be slightly less of a hater?
[66.00 --> 68.00]  I'm so worried. Like would it actually kill you to be...
[68.00 --> 70.00]  That my Office from 2010
[70.00 --> 72.00]  is still gonna work on everything that I use.
[72.00 --> 74.00]  To be slightly less of a hater?
[74.00 --> 76.00]  That's so unfortunate that it's gonna be totally fine.
[76.00 --> 78.00]  Apple suffered a significant source code leak.
[78.00 --> 80.00]  And Intel is...
[80.00 --> 84.00]  They've got this Vaunt project that's like smart glasses.
[84.00 --> 86.00]  But like...
[86.00 --> 88.00]  Smarter than previous glasses. But like...
[88.00 --> 90.00]  Super smart glasses. But not that like techy.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  But like there's a lot of tech in them.
[92.00 --> 94.00]  But like you don't see it. Yeah.
[94.00 --> 96.00]  And uh... Anyway, we'll get to that.
[96.00 --> 98.00]  And the show today is brought to you by...
[98.00 --> 102.00]  Samsung Super Ultra Wide Gaming!
[102.00 --> 104.00]  Whoa!
[104.00 --> 106.00]  Let's roll that intro. Do you think the intro will work?
[106.00 --> 108.00]  I mean we're on time. Could the intro really work
[108.00 --> 110.00]  on the same day that we're on time? Yes. I believe.
[110.00 --> 112.00]  Yeah!
[112.00 --> 114.00]  It's amazing.
[114.00 --> 118.00]  It's almost like we had Colton down here fixing everything before we started.
[128.00 --> 132.00]  Oops. I'm trying to type HTTP colon slash slash.
[132.00 --> 134.00]  Now it's all like HTTP colon colon slash.
[134.00 --> 136.00]  That wouldn't work.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  Why do you even write the whole thing out?
[138.00 --> 140.00]  Because then it automatically hyperlinks and...
[140.00 --> 142.00]  Oh what did I just do? What just happened?
[142.00 --> 144.00]  No, it's fine. Everything's fine.
[144.00 --> 150.00]  For those of you who aren't already playing WAN Show Bingo...
[150.00 --> 154.00]  Now would probably be a good time to start.
[154.00 --> 157.00]  I wonder if they already have Luke laughs annoyingly loud.
[157.00 --> 159.00]  That seems to be a pretty...
[159.00 --> 160.00]  That's like a free square.
[160.00 --> 161.00]  That's a freebie.
[161.00 --> 162.00]  That should just be the middle square.
[162.00 --> 165.00]  The freebie middle square is that we're late.
[165.00 --> 166.00]  Is it really?
[166.00 --> 167.00]  I'm pretty sure.
[167.00 --> 168.00]  No!
[168.00 --> 169.00]  Oh wow.
[169.00 --> 171.00]  So it's gonna be a lot harder today.
[171.00 --> 173.00]  Get absolutely wrecked everyone.
[173.00 --> 175.00]  Oh man.
[175.00 --> 178.00]  I feel like I only talked to you during WAN Show.
[178.00 --> 180.00]  We didn't even manage to do lunch this week.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  No, but we're doing dinner on Sunday.
[182.00 --> 183.00]  Are we? Oh fun.
[183.00 --> 184.00]  Don't forget that.
[184.00 --> 185.00]  Right.
[185.00 --> 186.00]  That's important.
[186.00 --> 187.00]  Yeah, okay.
[187.00 --> 188.00]  You need to be there.
[188.00 --> 189.00]  Right.
[189.00 --> 193.00]  Look, I go places when I'm supposed to be at them.
[193.00 --> 196.00]  I'm just making sure.
[196.00 --> 197.00]  Can I be late?
[197.00 --> 198.00]  Probably.
[198.00 --> 199.00]  Okay.
[199.00 --> 201.00]  Now everything will be fine.
[201.00 --> 204.00]  Then we don't have a problem then.
[204.00 --> 205.00]  Do we there, bud?
[205.00 --> 207.00]  That's a good call.
[207.00 --> 210.00]  So yeah, this is really cool.
[210.00 --> 216.00]  I will actually be meeting for the first time in person and some of them even digitally,
[216.00 --> 223.00]  the team that has been working on Floatplane, which technically I'm like sort of in charge of, on Sunday.
[223.00 --> 224.00]  Yeah.
[224.00 --> 231.00]  And it's going to be super exciting because we are getting to the point now where everyone is still frantically working on getting this thing going.
[231.00 --> 237.00]  Do you know how many messages I have gotten about people like Cody's lab having their channels disabled?
[237.00 --> 238.00]  Yeah.
[238.00 --> 242.00]  And just like generally people expressing frustration with YouTube.
[242.00 --> 243.00]  Yeah.
[243.00 --> 246.00]  And being like, yo, like are you guys still working on Floatplane?
[246.00 --> 247.00]  I have.
[247.00 --> 249.00]  Like are you guys going to let other creators on the platform?
[249.00 --> 251.00]  Because this seems like it would be a good thing for other creators.
[251.00 --> 253.00]  We know we're on it for trying.
[253.00 --> 254.00]  I will say this.
[254.00 --> 260.00]  For the people that are already subscribed, there will be something very cool posted on the 28th.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  Oh, really?
[261.00 --> 263.00]  In text form.
[263.00 --> 264.00]  In text form.
[264.00 --> 265.00]  On the site.
[265.00 --> 267.00]  What are you even talking about?
[267.00 --> 269.00]  I'm going to announce the thing and tell them they can go use it.
[269.00 --> 270.00]  Oh.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  Oh, cool.
[271.00 --> 272.00]  Okay.
[272.00 --> 274.00]  But it's just going to be for like them and stuff.
[274.00 --> 275.00]  So, yeah.
[275.00 --> 279.00]  So I've, believe it or not, I'm already in touch with Cody.
[279.00 --> 287.00]  Um, and we've, we've chatted about things and apparently the problem this time, um, I was
[287.00 --> 288.00]  watching his video.
[288.00 --> 293.00]  The problem this time was his video where he shows how you can make your own gunpowder
[293.00 --> 298.00]  by, um, I don't know what the process is called because I'm not nearly as sciencey as Cody.
[298.00 --> 300.00]  So I apologize in advance for butchering this.
[300.00 --> 301.00]  He's a very sciencey dude.
[301.00 --> 302.00]  I love his stuff.
[302.00 --> 306.00]  But like, uh, um, I don't know.
[306.00 --> 310.00]  It wouldn't be like distilling because you're just taking like the leftover sediment.
[310.00 --> 317.00]  I think whatever something he took his own pee and left it for like 18 months and then extracted
[317.00 --> 322.00]  the nitrates from it in some way and made gunpowder, which is amazing.
[322.00 --> 326.00]  But technically explosives manufacturing.
[326.00 --> 332.00]  But, uh, I don't, I've always had enough for years.
[332.00 --> 333.00]  Yeah.
[333.00 --> 337.00]  And like, I kind of have a soft spot for like sciencey stuff.
[337.00 --> 338.00]  Yeah.
[338.00 --> 342.00]  Cause like if you had a science textbook from school, you're going to be able to figure that
[342.00 --> 343.00]  kind of stuff out.
[343.00 --> 345.00]  And like, look, he's in America.
[345.00 --> 352.00]  What, what he did was no more, like what he manufactured was no more dangerous than what
[352.00 --> 357.00]  you could get by hitting a screecheroo with a hammer and dumping the contents out onto
[357.00 --> 358.00]  the table.
[358.00 --> 360.00]  Or just going to Walmart and buying it.
[360.00 --> 361.00]  I bet you can just buy it at Walmart.
[361.00 --> 362.00]  Gunpowder?
[362.00 --> 363.00]  I doubt it.
[363.00 --> 364.00]  But you can get for...
[364.00 --> 365.00]  Oh, but you could just buy like...
[365.00 --> 366.00]  Refilling.
[366.00 --> 368.00]  I guess, uh, oh, can you just buy gunpowder at Walmart?
[368.00 --> 370.00]  I don't know if you can, I know you can just buy it.
[370.00 --> 372.00]  I don't know if you can just buy it from Walmart.
[372.00 --> 374.00]  Buy gunpowder Walmart.
[374.00 --> 376.00]  This video is not going to be monetized.
[376.00 --> 377.00]  Um...
[377.00 --> 378.00]  Reloading equipment Walmart!
[378.00 --> 380.00]  Yeah, but it's probably black powder.
[380.00 --> 381.00]  Black powder?
[381.00 --> 382.00]  Really?
[382.00 --> 384.00]  Which I don't think is technically gunpowder.
[384.00 --> 386.00]  I don't know if it would be black powder.
[386.00 --> 388.00]  Because I think gunpowder is technically white powder.
[388.00 --> 389.00]  I mean, don't...
[389.00 --> 390.00]  Black powder rifles are like...
[390.00 --> 391.00]  I am not, yeah.
[391.00 --> 396.00]  So we've got a HOX number nine black powder gun bore cleaner and patch lubricant.
[396.00 --> 398.00]  Um, they've got a powder coated thing.
[398.00 --> 399.00]  No, I don't know.
[399.00 --> 400.00]  I don't think they sell it.
[400.00 --> 401.00]  Okay, okay.
[401.00 --> 402.00]  Um, they've got cleaning, cleaning stuff for black powder.
[402.00 --> 405.00]  I think black powder is a fair bit easier to obtain.
[405.00 --> 407.00]  I don't remember exactly what the difference is, but...
[407.00 --> 408.00]  Still goes boom.
[408.00 --> 409.00]  Something matters.
[409.00 --> 411.00]  It does go boom, but in a different way.
[411.00 --> 412.00]  Yeah.
[412.00 --> 413.00]  In a different way.
[413.00 --> 416.00]  Um, so anyway, we've had a lot of people contacting us about it.
[416.00 --> 418.00]  Right, so where was I going with this?
[418.00 --> 421.00]  Um, yeah, right, right, right.
[421.00 --> 422.00]  Right, right, right.
[422.00 --> 431.00]  So it's technically explosives manufacturing, but in the same sense that when I crossed the border and didn't declare the firecr-
[431.00 --> 432.00]  Shut up.
[432.00 --> 433.00]  What did you do about?
[433.00 --> 441.00]  The black cats and I forget what else I had, but I had, like, honestly, the sticks are like this big.
[441.00 --> 442.00]  Yeah.
[442.00 --> 458.00]  So in the same sense that I was technically transporting explosives across the border, which Canadian border services was not le stoked on, as Canadian border services tend to call it when they are...
[458.00 --> 459.00]  Less stoked.
[459.00 --> 460.00]  Less stoked.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  Less stoked.
[461.00 --> 462.00]  We are not less stoked.
[462.00 --> 463.00]  Um...
[463.00 --> 465.00]  Like, it is...
[465.00 --> 466.00]  Yeah.
[466.00 --> 471.00]  But it's also not because it's, like, not dangerous.
[471.00 --> 476.00]  Like, you could have a black cat go off on your hand and it'd be like, ow!
[476.00 --> 477.00]  Crap!
[477.00 --> 479.00]  That was dumb, but I'm fine.
[479.00 --> 482.00]  They're a little bit stronger than, like, an individual mighty mite.
[482.00 --> 484.00]  Like, come on!
[484.00 --> 487.00]  Why are they illegal in Canada?
[487.00 --> 488.00]  Yeah.
[488.00 --> 490.00]  This was my form of protest, okay?
[490.00 --> 491.00]  That...
[491.00 --> 494.00]  I was protesting.
[494.00 --> 498.00]  Samsung is not gonna be impressed with this show that they're tuning into at this point.
[498.00 --> 504.00]  Colton's like, you guys, you guys, Samsung's watching the show.
[504.00 --> 505.00]  Oh, jeez.
[505.00 --> 506.00]  But that's okay.
[506.00 --> 507.00]  That's okay.
[507.00 --> 510.00]  This was my form of protest, okay?
[510.00 --> 511.00]  Yeah.
[511.00 --> 512.00]  Um...
[512.00 --> 513.00]  And I...
[513.00 --> 517.00]  They were like, you know we can keep your car, right?
[517.00 --> 521.00]  And back then, my car was worth at least a few hundred dollars.
[521.00 --> 528.00]  And I legitimately couldn't afford to just, like, replace it.
[528.00 --> 529.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[529.00 --> 533.00]  Whereas now, the replacement cost on my car would be significantly lower than that.
[533.00 --> 534.00]  Yeah.
[534.00 --> 535.00]  Um...
[535.00 --> 538.00]  So I was like, oh, I could actually...
[538.00 --> 540.00]  Have you ever felt the blood drain out of your face?
[540.00 --> 541.00]  Yes.
[541.00 --> 542.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[542.00 --> 543.00]  Because...
[543.00 --> 544.00]  And I can completely imagine how in that moment that would happen.
[544.00 --> 548.00]  I felt the blood drain out of my face.
[548.00 --> 550.00]  And it was not a good thing, okay?
[550.00 --> 552.00]  It was not a good thing.
[552.00 --> 554.00]  To be fair, usually in moments like that, for me, it's the opposite.
[554.00 --> 555.00]  I usually feel just like...
[555.00 --> 556.00]  You go flush.
[556.00 --> 557.00]  Yeah.
[557.00 --> 558.00]  Interesting.
[558.00 --> 561.00]  Okay, so I'll get that with anger, but not with fear.
[561.00 --> 565.00]  I think, yeah, I think my response is usually similar.
[565.00 --> 566.00]  Okay.
[566.00 --> 569.00]  Yeah, so for me, the fear response is the...
[569.00 --> 570.00]  Is the blanching.
[570.00 --> 572.00]  I think it's called blanching.
[572.00 --> 573.00]  Um...
[573.00 --> 574.00]  Sure.
[574.00 --> 575.00]  And then the angry response, I'll get like the...
[575.00 --> 576.00]  Like the headache.
[576.00 --> 577.00]  Yeah.
[577.00 --> 578.00]  The throbby headache.
[578.00 --> 579.00]  That's the only one I can...
[580.00 --> 582.00]  It's like, I don't get scared.
[582.00 --> 584.00]  I'll just get angry.
[584.00 --> 585.00]  Well, I think it's...
[585.00 --> 586.00]  Luke Laffer, 2018.
[586.00 --> 588.00]  I love...
[588.00 --> 591.00]  Part of the response though is part of that is flee, right?
[591.00 --> 592.00]  Fight or flight?
[592.00 --> 593.00]  What?
[593.00 --> 594.00]  What?
[594.00 --> 601.00]  I never realized that one of your defining characteristics is a loud, obnoxious laugh.
[601.00 --> 602.00]  Yes.
[602.00 --> 604.00]  And your handle...
[604.00 --> 605.00]  Is Laffer.
[605.00 --> 608.00]  Is your name abbreviated to laugh?
[608.00 --> 609.00]  Yeah.
[609.00 --> 613.00]  Was that because your gaming buddies hated your laugh in their microphone ears?
[613.00 --> 615.00]  It is literally partially that.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  Wow!
[616.00 --> 618.00]  Also because that's just my last name short.
[619.00 --> 621.00]  Right, but that's the double entendre of...
[621.00 --> 622.00]  Yes.
[622.00 --> 623.00]  Yes.
[623.00 --> 624.00]  You know what?
[624.00 --> 625.00]  You know what?
[625.00 --> 626.00]  We're...
[626.00 --> 627.00]  You know what?
[627.00 --> 628.00]  Sorry, Samsung.
[628.00 --> 633.00]  We're ending the show now because that's enough knowledge bombs for one WAN show.
[633.00 --> 634.00]  Forget it.
[634.00 --> 635.00]  I'm done.
[635.00 --> 637.00]  The whole chat is just like, wow!
[637.00 --> 638.00]  Wow!
[638.00 --> 639.00]  Wow!
[639.00 --> 642.00]  Can you tell there's no news this week?
[642.00 --> 643.00]  Wow!
[643.00 --> 646.00]  Actually, you know what?
[646.00 --> 648.00]  We do have something really important.
[648.00 --> 649.00]  There's great news.
[649.00 --> 651.00]  Okay, let's actually do a news topic.
[651.00 --> 652.00]  Yeah.
[652.00 --> 653.00]  The greatest news.
[653.00 --> 654.00]  The most important news.
[654.00 --> 655.00]  Yeah.
[655.00 --> 656.00]  It's probably kind of a big deal.
[656.00 --> 657.00]  Okay.
[657.00 --> 660.00]  So I don't actually know if this is in the doc, but this is right off of the creator blog.
[660.00 --> 667.00]  So the source for this news topic is actually our YouTube rep who was like, so...
[668.00 --> 669.00]  Can you post it in the chat?
[669.00 --> 673.00]  You should probably be aware of this at some point.
[674.00 --> 675.00]  I think we're fine.
[675.00 --> 676.00]  No, no, it's not.
[676.00 --> 677.00]  It wasn't like that.
[677.00 --> 678.00]  It was just like...
[678.00 --> 679.00]  You should know what's going on.
[679.00 --> 683.00]  You guys should know what's going on because, hey, we're trying to do a better job of communicating
[683.00 --> 686.00]  with creators and being more transparent and all that stuff.
[686.00 --> 691.00]  And like it's, you know, it's really cool that we have a creator rep now because for
[691.00 --> 695.00]  a long time, even when I thought we were kind of big enough to justify one, we didn't,
[695.00 --> 696.00]  but we do.
[696.00 --> 702.00]  So, you know, honestly, I'm going to read big chunks of this at a time because you guys
[702.00 --> 704.00]  probably aren't going to go off and read it.
[704.00 --> 706.00]  And the message is really, really important.
[706.00 --> 712.00]  So the title of the article on the blog is Preventing Harm to the Broader YouTube Community.
[712.00 --> 719.00]  Because honestly, a lot of the reaction to some of the creators recently, whether we're
[719.00 --> 725.00]  talking Spider-Man and Elsa crap or whether we're talking about, you know, people who are
[725.00 --> 733.00]  promoting hate or whether we're talking about people who are creating content that is culturally
[733.00 --> 736.00]  insensitive and just straight inappropriate.
[736.00 --> 743.00]  There has been, there have been a lot of reactions from YouTubers that honestly, I have to confess,
[743.00 --> 744.00]  I never felt this way.
[744.00 --> 745.00]  Yeah.
[745.00 --> 749.00]  I never really felt like I was being lumped in.
[749.00 --> 750.00]  And did you?
[750.00 --> 751.00]  No.
[751.00 --> 752.00]  Okay.
[752.00 --> 762.00]  I never felt like I was being lumped in with destructive or hateful creators.
[762.00 --> 764.00]  We do get lumped in with tech YouTube.
[764.00 --> 765.00]  That's true.
[765.00 --> 766.00]  But we are sectioned off.
[766.00 --> 768.00]  I got referred to as a tech bro.
[768.00 --> 769.00]  Yeah.
[769.00 --> 771.00]  For the first time actually a couple of weeks ago.
[771.00 --> 774.00]  And that was enlightening for me because I'd never heard the term before apparently.
[774.00 --> 775.00]  I haven't heard tech bro.
[775.00 --> 776.00]  Yeah.
[776.00 --> 777.00]  We're in the tech side.
[777.00 --> 778.00]  Okay.
[778.00 --> 779.00]  We are fairly segmented.
[779.00 --> 784.00]  So, so we don't really feel any way like we get lumped in with the broader YouTuber community,
[784.00 --> 790.00]  but there were a lot of reactions from people going like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[790.00 --> 791.00]  Hey, hold on a second.
[791.00 --> 794.00]  Um, you know, I'm getting a lot of vitriol.
[794.00 --> 796.00]  I'm getting a lot of negative feedback here.
[796.00 --> 804.00]  Yo, not all YouTubers are willing to, or feel like it's right to, to play this game where it's
[804.00 --> 807.00]  all about the shock value for views.
[807.00 --> 808.00]  Yeah.
[808.00 --> 812.00]  Like, in fact, a lot of us really want nothing to do with that.
[812.00 --> 815.00]  Please do not lump us in.
[815.00 --> 820.00]  But the reality of it is, is that as soon as whether it's a really dangerous or a really
[820.00 --> 827.00]  hurtful prank, or whether it is something like the incident in Japan, when that kind
[827.00 --> 833.00]  of stuff hits the mainstream media, and I mean mainstream media, not as like a derogatory
[833.00 --> 834.00]  term, I mean like TV.
[834.00 --> 842.00]  When it hits people who don't live and breathe online video content like we do, I can see
[842.00 --> 843.00]  how people might generalize.
[843.00 --> 846.00]  Oh, it's another YouTuber in the news.
[846.00 --> 847.00]  It's easy to do that.
[847.00 --> 851.00]  Doing something stupid for views and for money.
[851.00 --> 852.00]  Yeah.
[852.00 --> 853.00]  Right?
[853.00 --> 854.00]  So, I get that.
[854.00 --> 858.00]  And so ultimately this is, this is YouTube's reaction to this.
[858.00 --> 864.00]  Recently we faced situations, situations, like this is not an isolated incident, so they
[864.00 --> 869.00]  had to do something, where the egregious actions of a handful of YouTubers harmed the reputation
[869.00 --> 874.00]  of the broader creator community among advertisers, the media industry, and most importantly the
[874.00 --> 875.00]  general public.
[875.00 --> 879.00]  And in light of this behavior and our commitment to tighten our policies and communicate them
[879.00 --> 883.00]  more quickly and transparently, double thumbs up for me for that, thank you.
[883.00 --> 884.00]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[884.00 --> 889.00]  We're introducing new consequences to apply in the rare event when one creator's actions
[889.00 --> 890.00]  harm the entire community.
[890.00 --> 896.00]  Because in the past, pretty much all they could do was issue a strike for a copyright violation,
[896.00 --> 902.00]  or a violation of the community guidelines, or they would pull the monetization usually
[902.00 --> 908.00]  just from an individual video where something got reported and was reviewed by a human and
[908.00 --> 910.00]  found, or even not reviewed by a human for the last little bit.
[910.00 --> 912.00]  That's been a whole other fiasco.
[912.00 --> 915.00]  And they would pull the monetization, but usually just from one video.
[915.00 --> 920.00]  So now they're saying when one creator does something particularly blatant, like a heinous
[920.00 --> 924.00]  prank where people are traumatized, or they promote violence or hate, or demonstrate cruelty,
[924.00 --> 929.00]  or sensationalize the pain of others in an attempt to gain views or subscribers, that can cause
[929.00 --> 933.00]  lasting damage to the community, including viewers, creators, and the outside world.
[933.00 --> 937.00]  So they're saying that's why they want to make sure that the actions of a few don't
[937.00 --> 943.00]  impact the 99.9% who use their channels to connect with fans and build a thriving business.
[943.00 --> 950.00]  And even though I didn't think about it initially as us being lumped in with other YouTubers,
[950.00 --> 955.00]  in much the same way that a talk show host might not necessarily have gone, oh, because back in
[955.00 --> 960.00]  the early 2000s when Tom Green was kind of running around doing crazy stuff.
[960.00 --> 965.00]  Or you look at guys like Bam Margara from, he joined Jackass at some point.
[965.00 --> 968.00]  I think I knew him when he was CKY or something like that before.
[968.00 --> 969.00]  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
[969.00 --> 971.00]  Whatever their group was called before that.
[971.00 --> 974.00]  One of my friends had, it was a VHS.
[974.00 --> 979.00]  Anyway, one of my friends had one of their tapes and I had kind of watched it and gone,
[979.00 --> 981.00]  oh, okay, I guess you're into that. That's cool.
[981.00 --> 986.00]  I never really got into it. But anyway, the point is, like, I can see, like,
[986.00 --> 991.00]  while some other talk show host might not have gone, oh, I'm at risk of being grouped in,
[991.00 --> 995.00]  that doesn't necessarily fly with YouTube. And it did seem to be happening.
[995.00 --> 1002.00]  So, you know, I'm glad as one of the 99.9% who do use our channel, I feel like constructively,
[1002.00 --> 1008.00]  I'm glad that they are doing this. So here is the stick that they're brandishing.
[1008.00 --> 1015.00]  Because ultimately it's not like any of these community guidelines or advertiser-friendly guidelines for monetization are new.
[1015.00 --> 1023.00]  It's just that they didn't really have, like, a thing they were going to hit you with if you didn't adhere to them.
[1023.00 --> 1024.00]  Sorry.
[1024.00 --> 1025.00]  Sorry, everyone.
[1025.00 --> 1026.00]  That was probably terrible.
[1026.00 --> 1027.00]  My bad. My bad.
[1027.00 --> 1029.00]  So number one.
[1029.00 --> 1030.00]  Oh.
[1030.00 --> 1037.00]  Premium monetization programs, promotion, and content development partnerships.
[1037.00 --> 1045.00]  So they may remove a channel from Google Preferred and also suspend, cancel, or remove a creator's YouTube original.
[1045.00 --> 1049.00]  And that's something that they already did as a reaction to one of the recent occurrences.
[1049.00 --> 1050.00]  Yeah.
[1050.00 --> 1060.00]  People argued they didn't do it fast enough, but I am personally of the mind that doing the right thing eventually is still good.
[1060.00 --> 1068.00]  And we're not talking they didn't do it fast enough, like, they finished the entire season and shipped the whole thing and then just, like, didn't renew it.
[1068.00 --> 1071.00]  Like, they canceled it.
[1071.00 --> 1074.00]  So it took them a few days and, like, they could have done better.
[1074.00 --> 1078.00]  But you've got to understand, too, a company like Google is a big ship.
[1078.00 --> 1085.00]  Like, when you are trying to make a decision, like, giving the boot to one of your top creators, it's...
[1085.00 --> 1087.00]  There's multiple people.
[1087.00 --> 1093.00]  Maybe people are, like, traveling when the whole thing goes down and they get to, like, get back to the office to talk about this stuff.
[1093.00 --> 1099.00]  I know you're being vague for a point, but you even lost me slightly here in terms of, like, which program was canceled.
[1099.00 --> 1100.00]  Logan Paul.
[1100.00 --> 1101.00]  His YouTube red.
[1101.00 --> 1102.00]  I didn't even know he had one.
[1102.00 --> 1103.00]  Yeah.
[1103.00 --> 1104.00]  Okay.
[1104.00 --> 1105.00]  Yeah.
[1105.00 --> 1106.00]  Cool.
[1106.00 --> 1107.00]  Okay.
[1107.00 --> 1108.00]  Okay.
[1108.00 --> 1109.00]  Number two.
[1109.00 --> 1110.00]  I had no idea.
[1110.00 --> 1112.00]  I thought you were talking about when it happened to PewDiePie and I was like, not all this completely lines up.
[1112.00 --> 1113.00]  No.
[1113.00 --> 1114.00]  Okay.
[1114.00 --> 1115.00]  Monetization and creator support privileges.
[1115.00 --> 1122.00]  We may suspend a channel's ability to serve ads altogether, not just on the video, their ability to earn revenue,
[1122.00 --> 1130.00]  and potentially remove a channel from the YouTube Partner Program outright, including creator support and access to YouTube spaces.
[1130.00 --> 1132.00]  Number three.
[1132.00 --> 1134.00]  Video recommendations.
[1134.00 --> 1135.00]  This.
[1135.00 --> 1136.00]  Those other two are, like...
[1136.00 --> 1137.00]  This is huge.
[1137.00 --> 1139.00]  Those are, those are, whatever.
[1139.00 --> 1143.00]  Like, they're, yes, they're meaningful, but, like, really? YouTube spaces?
[1143.00 --> 1144.00]  What were there, like, three?
[1144.00 --> 1146.00]  They saved the most important one for last.
[1146.00 --> 1147.00]  Yeah.
[1147.00 --> 1148.00]  They saved the most...
[1148.00 --> 1149.00]  This one...
[1149.00 --> 1151.00]  I would have put this one first if I was, like, trying to make a point.
[1151.00 --> 1152.00]  Holy crap.
[1152.00 --> 1153.00]  This is a big deal.
[1153.00 --> 1155.00]  Video recommendations.
[1155.00 --> 1166.00]  We may remove a channel's eligibility to be recommended on YouTube, such as appearing on the homepage, trending tab, or watch next.
[1166.00 --> 1168.00]  That's, like, you're done.
[1168.00 --> 1169.00]  Whoa.
[1169.00 --> 1174.00]  Like, that is basically a shadow ban.
[1174.00 --> 1176.00]  Would be the closest parallel?
[1176.00 --> 1179.00]  It, like, not directly, but sort of.
[1179.00 --> 1184.00]  The, the amount of people that go directly to people's channels to watch videos is low.
[1184.00 --> 1188.00]  Even if you're like, oh, I do that, you're probably in the more hardcore of audiences.
[1188.00 --> 1190.00]  It, it doesn't happen that much.
[1190.00 --> 1195.00]  The, the other thing, too, is that especially as you, as you...
[1195.00 --> 1196.00]  Okay.
[1196.00 --> 1202.00]  So, to the layperson, the average person, a big subscriber number seems really important on YouTube.
[1202.00 --> 1205.00]  Like, I'm actually in the process of, um, you know what?
[1205.00 --> 1208.00]  I, we, I want to be intentionally really vague here.
[1208.00 --> 1213.00]  I'm in the process of either trying to sell or buy a YouTube channel right now.
[1213.00 --> 1221.00]  And the person that I'm either trying to sell to or buy from is attributing a value to this particular asset.
[1221.00 --> 1222.00]  Don't worry about it.
[1222.00 --> 1223.00]  Do you not know about this?
[1223.00 --> 1224.00]  Well, I know what's going on.
[1224.00 --> 1225.00]  Oh, okay, okay.
[1225.00 --> 1226.00]  But that's, like...
[1226.00 --> 1227.00]  Just don't worry about it.
[1227.00 --> 1229.00]  ... vague to the point of, like, being aggressive.
[1229.00 --> 1230.00]  Aggressive.
[1230.00 --> 1231.00]  Okay.
[1231.00 --> 1232.00]  All right.
[1232.00 --> 1233.00]  Okay.
[1233.00 --> 1239.00]  So they're trying to attribute a value to this item that is all kind of around the subscriber number.
[1239.00 --> 1244.00]  And I can see how to the average person that would make sense.
[1244.00 --> 1249.00]  And on the low end of the scale, like when we're talking the first thousand, first 10,000 subscribers...
[1249.00 --> 1250.00]  Yeah.
[1250.00 --> 1251.00]  ... that actually matters.
[1251.00 --> 1252.00]  Yeah.
[1252.00 --> 1258.00]  A channel with 10,000 subscribers is an order of magnitude more valuable than one with a thousand.
[1258.00 --> 1259.00]  Yeah.
[1259.00 --> 1263.00]  And that's maybe true of 100,000, but probably not.
[1263.00 --> 1265.00]  We're probably losing...
[1265.00 --> 1268.00]  We're probably hitting the tailing off of that.
[1268.00 --> 1276.00]  And the reason for that is that subscribers, they're not actually that loyal of watchers,
[1276.00 --> 1283.00]  which is a combination of YouTube's algorithmic way that they serve videos to them, and people just, like, moving on.
[1283.00 --> 1285.00]  Like, in their lives.
[1285.00 --> 1289.00]  Like, there's people who subscribe to Linus Tech Tips literally nine years ago.
[1289.00 --> 1290.00]  Yeah.
[1290.00 --> 1292.00]  Like, they subscribed when they were 15.
[1292.00 --> 1293.00]  And you know what?
[1293.00 --> 1294.00]  And they are now 24.
[1294.00 --> 1295.00]  Maybe you still watch.
[1295.00 --> 1296.00]  Maybe you do.
[1296.00 --> 1297.00]  And that's super cool.
[1297.00 --> 1305.00]  But maybe in the time between grade 9 or 10 and graduating a university or college or train program...
[1305.00 --> 1306.00]  Or, like, potentially having a baby.
[1306.00 --> 1308.00]  Potentially having a child and a job.
[1308.00 --> 1318.00]  Maybe at some point in that time, your interest faded, you just kind of stopped watching, YouTube stopped serving you the videos, and you just didn't care.
[1318.00 --> 1319.00]  And that's fine.
[1319.00 --> 1324.00]  So, once you reach a certain scale, what ultimately drives viewership...
[1324.00 --> 1331.00]  And I'm talking, like, more than half for big channels that depend on virality and sharing.
[1331.00 --> 1332.00]  And, and...
[1332.00 --> 1333.00]  Especially if you depend on virality and sharing.
[1333.00 --> 1335.00]  There's some channels that will have multiple videos...
[1335.00 --> 1336.00]  And controversy.
[1336.00 --> 1339.00]  ...that are over a million views, but they have, like, 20,000 subscribers.
[1339.00 --> 1340.00]  Yeah.
[1340.00 --> 1347.00]  And especially if you've been taking advantage of some of the recent algorithmic tricks, like creating feedback loops between yours and your brother's channel.
[1347.00 --> 1348.00]  Say, for example...
[1348.00 --> 1350.00]  It was very effective.
[1350.00 --> 1358.00]  If you get dropped from recommended, that ultimately stops the chain reaction.
[1358.00 --> 1359.00]  And it really helps your growth.
[1359.00 --> 1363.00]  It's like you sell things only out of a brick and mortar store, and they took your store away.
[1363.00 --> 1364.00]  That's right.
[1364.00 --> 1368.00]  Like, you might still be able to sell some things to people that are gonna, like, go through the process of going to your house.
[1368.00 --> 1369.00]  Or, like...
[1369.00 --> 1370.00]  You know what?
[1370.00 --> 1371.00]  No, hold on.
[1371.00 --> 1372.00]  Your store's still there.
[1372.00 --> 1374.00]  But you can't find it in the phone book.
[1374.00 --> 1375.00]  Or, like, on the internet.
[1375.00 --> 1378.00]  And anyone who shops at it isn't allowed to tell anyone about it.
[1378.00 --> 1379.00]  Yeah.
[1379.00 --> 1380.00]  Like...
[1380.00 --> 1381.00]  Yeah.
[1381.00 --> 1382.00]  Literally just foot traffic.
[1382.00 --> 1385.00]  So that's really, really interesting.
[1385.00 --> 1390.00]  And a huge move from YouTube that I think is...
[1390.00 --> 1391.00]  You know what?
[1391.00 --> 1397.00]  I don't know if I could say anything more supportive than what I've said.
[1397.00 --> 1402.00]  Which is why I'm gonna get into the stuff that's maybe a little bit not as supportive.
[1402.00 --> 1407.00]  The danger here is that they have laid out...
[1407.00 --> 1409.00]  Here's what they've said.
[1409.00 --> 1428.00]  When one creator does something particularly blatant, like conducts a heinous prank where people are traumatized, promotes violence or hate towards a group, demonstrates cruelty, or sensationalizes the pain of others in an attempt to gain viewers or subscribers, we are going to create this...
[1428.00 --> 1433.00]  In rare instances, they do say, we created this broader set of tools that can be used more
[1433.00 --> 1437.00]  quickly and effectively than our current system of guidelines and strikes.
[1437.00 --> 1449.00]  So they are basically saying that outside of the guidelines and the strike system, which are very sort of clearly laid out, they have additional harder tools that they can apply.
[1449.00 --> 1455.00]  So what sounds like to me, they've laid out examples, but this sounds like pretty much at their discretion.
[1455.00 --> 1479.00]  Which means that there are going to be some people out there who toe the line pretty closely between satire and hate speech or political commentary and whatever.
[1479.00 --> 1481.00]  And I worry about like misquoting and...
[1481.00 --> 1484.00]  I worry about things being taken out of context.
[1484.00 --> 1492.00]  I worry about the general culture we have of, you know, professional offense to anything.
[1492.00 --> 1493.00]  And I do...
[1493.00 --> 1497.00]  Because there is genuine offense, which is kind of what they're talking about, but then...
[1497.00 --> 1510.00]  And one of the things that I have defended YouTube over in the past is their right to remove monetization from something that they don't feel is appropriate for their platform and their advertisers.
[1510.00 --> 1512.00]  That is absolutely within their right.
[1512.00 --> 1519.00]  And while others have gone and yelled, censorship, censorship, that is not censorship.
[1519.00 --> 1520.00]  Yeah.
[1520.00 --> 1534.00]  What is getting a lot closer to censorship is refusing to recommend or provide placement on the site for something that they deem inappropriate.
[1534.00 --> 1536.00]  At the same time, yes.
[1536.00 --> 1538.00]  At the same time, it is a private platform.
[1538.00 --> 1540.00]  And it is well within their right.
[1540.00 --> 1544.00]  But that's why I said it's a lot closer.
[1544.00 --> 1545.00]  Yeah.
[1545.00 --> 1551.00]  Not allowing someone to make money and make you look bad to your advertisers, that's a no-brainer.
[1551.00 --> 1553.00]  No one should have been calling that censorship.
[1553.00 --> 1554.00]  Sorry.
[1554.00 --> 1558.00]  But saying, look, you're not going to get placement on the homepage.
[1558.00 --> 1560.00]  You're not going to get recommended to people.
[1560.00 --> 1561.00]  We're going to take away these mechanisms.
[1561.00 --> 1565.00]  We're not going to treat your content neutrally.
[1565.00 --> 1566.00]  Okay.
[1566.00 --> 1569.00]  Now we're not talking about monetization.
[1569.00 --> 1572.00]  We're talking about cutting off your actual voice.
[1572.00 --> 1575.00]  Again, it's technically a private platform.
[1575.00 --> 1576.00]  Technically a private platform.
[1576.00 --> 1577.00]  It's not a government-run thing.
[1577.00 --> 1578.00]  And it's absolutely within their right.
[1578.00 --> 1579.00]  Yeah.
[1579.00 --> 1582.00]  So it is not censorship in that sense at all.
[1582.00 --> 1585.00]  But it is an interesting step, if nothing else.
[1585.00 --> 1591.00]  And it's one of the side effects of having a free, completely open platform.
[1591.00 --> 1592.00]  Hey, hey.
[1592.00 --> 1593.00]  Anyways, moving on.
[1593.00 --> 1595.00]  We'll talk about Floatplane later, okay?
[1595.00 --> 1596.00]  Yeah.
[1596.00 --> 1597.00]  All right.
[1597.00 --> 1600.00]  So there you go, guys.
[1600.00 --> 1601.00]  That's kind of...
[1601.00 --> 1602.00]  Wow.
[1602.00 --> 1605.00]  That actually ended up taking up like half the freaking show.
[1605.00 --> 1606.00]  Which is probably good.
[1606.00 --> 1607.00]  Which is probably fine.
[1607.00 --> 1611.00]  Because that was kind of the biggest thing that happened, at least in our corner of the
[1611.00 --> 1613.00]  internet this week.
[1613.00 --> 1617.00]  When I got that in my inbox, I just about freaked out.
[1617.00 --> 1619.00]  Because I was like, oh no.
[1619.00 --> 1622.00]  Because all I read was the subject line first.
[1622.00 --> 1624.00]  I was like, oh crap.
[1624.00 --> 1630.00]  What fresh hell is coming for us now on the platform?
[1630.00 --> 1634.00]  What are they cracking down on this time?
[1634.00 --> 1635.00]  All right.
[1635.00 --> 1640.00]  Well, why don't we jump into something that's just a little bit more chillaxed, okay?
[1640.00 --> 1646.00]  Intel made some smart glasses that might actually not make you look like a dummy.
[1646.00 --> 1647.00]  Yeah.
[1647.00 --> 1648.00]  Yay!
[1648.00 --> 1649.00]  Look at that.
[1649.00 --> 1650.00]  They look pretty normal.
[1650.00 --> 1651.00]  Okay.
[1651.00 --> 1654.00]  Other than the number, which I'm sure is just an engineering sample like number thing.
[1654.00 --> 1655.00]  Okay.
[1655.00 --> 1656.00]  That might stay.
[1656.00 --> 1657.00]  I'm not sure about that.
[1657.00 --> 1658.00]  Okay.
[1658.00 --> 1660.00]  But this is Intel's new Vaunt smart glasses.
[1660.00 --> 1663.00]  The original article here is from The Verge.
[1663.00 --> 1673.00]  And they are a total departure from Google Glass, which led to the uprising of the glass
[1673.00 --> 1674.00]  holes.
[1674.00 --> 1675.00]  Yeah.
[1675.00 --> 1677.00]  Well, because, and reasons why you don't see any physical hardware on it.
[1677.00 --> 1679.00]  And there is not a camera.
[1679.00 --> 1680.00]  There's no buttons.
[1680.00 --> 1681.00]  There is a screen.
[1681.00 --> 1686.00]  It says it doesn't have a screen because I believe it's like a...
[1686.00 --> 1687.00]  Sorry.
[1687.00 --> 1688.00]  No.
[1688.00 --> 1689.00]  Okay.
[1689.00 --> 1690.00]  Okay.
[1690.00 --> 1692.00]  Technically no screen in the traditional sense.
[1692.00 --> 1693.00]  Yes.
[1693.00 --> 1694.00]  Yeah.
[1694.00 --> 1695.00]  There's no microphone.
[1695.00 --> 1696.00]  And there is...
[1696.00 --> 1697.00]  So you can't talk to it and it can't talk to you.
[1697.00 --> 1698.00]  There is no touch area.
[1698.00 --> 1699.00]  No.
[1699.00 --> 1701.00]  So it has none of these things.
[1701.00 --> 1706.00]  They look and feel just like regular glasses.
[1706.00 --> 1710.00]  This is really the line that summarizes it best.
[1710.00 --> 1712.00]  And this is from one of Intel's developers.
[1712.00 --> 1716.00]  So we really believe that it can't have what they're calling a social cost.
[1716.00 --> 1721.00]  Can you imagine the focus group that sat around and coined the term social cost?
[1721.00 --> 1722.00]  Social cost.
[1722.00 --> 1723.00]  Yeah.
[1723.00 --> 1726.00]  How many of the things you do have a social cost, Luke?
[1726.00 --> 1728.00]  How many of the things you do don't have a social cost?
[1728.00 --> 1730.00]  Yeah, I was just going to say like everything.
[1730.00 --> 1731.00]  I don't know.
[1731.00 --> 1735.00]  So, and this is continuing the quote.
[1735.00 --> 1744.00]  If it's weird, if you look geeky, if you're tapping and fiddling at it, then we've lost.
[1744.00 --> 1745.00]  Okay.
[1745.00 --> 1752.00]  So Vaunt is just a system for displaying a small heads-up display in your peripheral vision.
[1752.00 --> 1756.00]  It can show simple messages like directions or notifications.
[1756.00 --> 1762.00]  It works over Bluetooth with Android or iOS phones like your smartwatch, taking commands from an app on your phone.
[1762.00 --> 1773.00]  And the display, this is cool, is projected into your eye by a freaking laser that shines a red monochrome image.
[1773.00 --> 1774.00]  Which is amazing.
[1774.00 --> 1783.00]  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 by 150 pixels onto a holographic reflector on the glasses right lens.
[1783.00 --> 1787.00]  One of the reasons why I love this is the red monochrome brings it all the way back to Virtual Boy.
[1787.00 --> 1788.00]  Sorry, continue.
[1788.00 --> 1793.00]  That image is then reflected into the back of your eyeball directly onto the retina.
[1793.00 --> 1794.00]  Yeah.
[1794.00 --> 1798.00]  The laser is so low power that it doesn't even need to be certified.
[1798.00 --> 1799.00]  Oh, goodness.
[1799.00 --> 1803.00]  It's at the very bottom of a class one laser.
[1803.00 --> 1804.00]  That's not a good thing.
[1804.00 --> 1805.00]  So I'm sure it's fine.
[1805.00 --> 1815.00]  Because it's directly shining on the back of your retina, the image is always in focus, works equally on prescription glasses and non-prescription lenses.
[1815.00 --> 1817.00]  Works indoors and outside.
[1817.00 --> 1822.00]  Is discreet beyond a faint red shimmer at very specific angles on the lens.
[1822.00 --> 1827.00]  Now is that in the picture that's there, is that the red or is that from the camera?
[1827.00 --> 1829.00]  I think they might be overselling it in the picture.
[1829.00 --> 1831.00]  Or is that just a reflection from the camera?
[1831.00 --> 1834.00]  You know what, let me have a quick boo here.
[1834.00 --> 1838.00]  Because they're saying that it's only from certain angles that it'll be visible.
[1838.00 --> 1840.00]  I don't think that's from the camera.
[1840.00 --> 1842.00]  I think, oh, you know what, I don't actually know.
[1842.00 --> 1843.00]  Here, you guys can.
[1843.00 --> 1844.00]  It's hard to tell.
[1844.00 --> 1845.00]  Whoops, whoops, whoops.
[1845.00 --> 1849.00]  No, I don't think that's from the camera.
[1849.00 --> 1850.00]  This is a little video.
[1850.00 --> 1851.00]  You want to play it?
[1851.00 --> 1854.00]  No, because I don't want to use their video.
[1854.00 --> 1855.00]  Okay.
[1855.00 --> 1856.00]  That's fair.
[1856.00 --> 1858.00]  Also, that's a sticker.
[1858.00 --> 1859.00]  Yeah, okay.
[1859.00 --> 1862.00]  So yeah, that QR code definitely won't stay there.
[1862.00 --> 1867.00]  So, yeah, the electronics are located entirely up near the face of the frames.
[1867.00 --> 1873.00]  And so that the rest of the stems, even the frame itself, can flex a little, just like a regular pair of glasses.
[1873.00 --> 1878.00]  And the batteries are, wow, where are the batteries?
[1878.00 --> 1879.00]  Huh.
[1879.00 --> 1880.00]  Okay.
[1880.00 --> 1882.00]  All custom hardware, including the silicon.
[1882.00 --> 1889.00]  So it has Bluetooth, an app processor, an accelerometer, and a compass, so it can detect some basic head gestures.
[1889.00 --> 1891.00]  Oh, come on!
[1891.00 --> 1896.00]  No social cost, but like, do you remember the head gestures with Google Glass?
[1896.00 --> 1897.00]  Okay.
[1897.00 --> 1898.00]  Ridiculous.
[1898.00 --> 1899.00]  And then...
[1899.00 --> 1900.00]  Thanks, dude.
[1900.00 --> 1904.00]  One kind of interesting thing is that it will just kind of tie in with other stuff.
[1904.00 --> 1907.00]  One of their notes here is, you're in the kitchen, you're cooking.
[1907.00 --> 1909.00]  Remember the episode of Fawlty Towers?
[1909.00 --> 1910.00]  Lionel Twitchin?
[1910.00 --> 1911.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1911.00 --> 1912.00]  No social cost, though.
[1912.00 --> 1922.00]  You're cooking, you ask Alexa, or sorry, the notes in here are A-L-E-X-A, but you ask Alexa, I need recipes for cookies.
[1922.00 --> 1925.00]  And bam, apparently it just shows up in your glasses.
[1925.00 --> 1928.00]  So, because you can't talk to it, it can't talk to you.
[1928.00 --> 1931.00]  But it can talk to your phone, you can talk to your phone, okay.
[1931.00 --> 1932.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[1932.00 --> 1933.00]  So you can talk to other things.
[1933.00 --> 1934.00]  Okay.
[1934.00 --> 1935.00]  You can use it that way.
[1935.00 --> 1938.00]  So, yeah, I wish them luck with that.
[1938.00 --> 1940.00]  I definitely want to try them.
[1940.00 --> 1944.00]  I suspect they're going to be super useless at the beginning, like pretty much anything smart.
[1944.00 --> 1945.00]  Yeah.
[1945.00 --> 1946.00]  But, yeah.
[1946.00 --> 1949.00]  This is the direction that I think both of us have been saying they have to go, though.
[1949.00 --> 1950.00]  Yeah.
[1950.00 --> 1951.00]  They have to look like normal glasses.
[1951.00 --> 1952.00]  Yeah.
[1952.00 --> 1953.00]  Everything has to be normal.
[1953.00 --> 1954.00]  Yeah.
[1954.00 --> 1970.00]  Like, you know, all of these, all these like fitness trackers and sleep trackers, like, until I can put it on and wear it for a week without taking it off at all, it's not collecting anywhere near enough useful data, and it should take like half an hour to charge.
[1970.00 --> 1973.00]  Like, it has to actually become part of your life.
[1973.00 --> 1974.00]  Yeah.
[1974.00 --> 1980.00]  Speaking of becoming part of your life, this episode of the WAN Show is brought to you by Samson!
[1980.00 --> 1985.00]  We actually have to like move out of the frame to show this entire monitor.
[1985.00 --> 1989.00]  This is, this is a Linus for scale.
[1989.00 --> 1991.00]  It's huge!
[1991.00 --> 1997.00]  So this is their 49 inch CHG90.
[1997.00 --> 2005.00]  This is a QLED monitor, and it is, ahem, the largest gaming monitor on the market.
[2005.00 --> 2009.00]  At 49 inches, with a 32 by 9 aspect ratio.
[2009.00 --> 2017.00]  And it is equal to two 27 inch wide screen monitors put together.
[2017.00 --> 2024.00]  Like, remember guys, we have seen wide monitors that are like two monitors put together before.
[2024.00 --> 2027.00]  But they were like two 5 by 4 monitors.
[2027.00 --> 2028.00]  Yeah.
[2028.00 --> 2032.00]  Now we have two wide screen monitors with no bezel whatsoever.
[2032.00 --> 2037.00]  And it's got an 1800R curvature that gives you a very immersive feel.
[2037.00 --> 2041.00]  So, um, like some, some curved monitors didn't need it.
[2041.00 --> 2043.00]  This one did, and it works really well.
[2043.00 --> 2045.00]  So things people could use it for.
[2045.00 --> 2050.00]  Actually, we've had this demo running pretty much the whole time, but, super wide screen gaming,
[2050.00 --> 2056.00]  whether you want, ah, like a more full view of your cockpit, or whether you want better peripheral vision in something like a shooter.
[2056.00 --> 2064.00]  You can see they've got a demo of things that you might not be able to see if you were gaming on a regular monitor versus a 16 by 9.
[2064.00 --> 2068.00]  Um, for me, looking at something like this, I go, yeah, productivity.
[2068.00 --> 2073.00]  Because I'm a big fan of, well, first wide screen.
[2073.00 --> 2074.00]  So first 16 by 10.
[2074.00 --> 2075.00]  Yeah.
[2075.00 --> 2078.00]  Then I grew to like 16 by 9 once the monitors got bigger.
[2078.00 --> 2080.00]  And you had to because there's no more 16 by 10.
[2080.00 --> 2083.00]  Then when they went wider, I was a fan of that.
[2083.00 --> 2091.00]  So if you're finding that your current monitor is not wide enough, or you have a dual 16 by 9 wide screen monitor,
[2091.00 --> 2094.00]  and you don't want the bezel anymore, then I could see this for productivity.
[2094.00 --> 2095.00]  Absolutely.
[2095.00 --> 2102.00]  Uh, one of the things that Colton had actually pitched was playing games in window mode, in the middle,
[2102.00 --> 2104.00]  and having like your Twitch chat.
[2104.00 --> 2105.00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2105.00 --> 2106.00]  On the side.
[2106.00 --> 2107.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[2107.00 --> 2108.00]  What, Colton?
[2108.00 --> 2109.00]  Nothing.
[2109.00 --> 2110.00]  I remembered.
[2110.00 --> 2111.00]  I remembered what you said.
[2111.00 --> 2112.00]  Good, dude.
[2112.00 --> 2113.00]  Okay, Colton.
[2113.00 --> 2114.00]  Thank you.
[2114.00 --> 2115.00]  You can have OBS or whatever on the other side.
[2115.00 --> 2116.00]  Yep.
[2116.00 --> 2117.00]  Like all your tools, OBS, your, your tipping software, all that kind of stuff.
[2117.00 --> 2118.00]  Yep.
[2118.00 --> 2119.00]  You have the chat on the other side.
[2119.00 --> 2120.00]  So you can run the whole thing on one monitor.
[2120.00 --> 2121.00]  Yeah.
[2121.00 --> 2123.00]  And it's got all the usual gaming features that you'd expect.
[2123.00 --> 2125.00]  It runs at 144 hertz.
[2125.00 --> 2128.00]  Ah, I keep rolling over this ethernet cable.
[2128.00 --> 2131.00]  Um, it's got support for HDR.
[2131.00 --> 2136.00]  It uses quantum dot technology, which basically gives you better color reproduction and better contrast.
[2136.00 --> 2145.00]  It's got AMD FreeSync 2, which I think the, in a nutshell version of that is that it's FreeSync, but with like HDR.
[2145.00 --> 2147.00]  And then I think like better FreeSync ranges and stuff.
[2147.00 --> 2151.00]  Like AMD's FreeSync standard is kind of a little loosey goosey.
[2151.00 --> 2154.00]  So FreeSync 2, I think basically means FreeSync, but with HDR.
[2154.00 --> 2155.00]  I know what it is, HDR.
[2155.00 --> 2156.00]  Yeah.
[2156.00 --> 2158.00]  Um, it features one millisecond response times.
[2158.00 --> 2162.00]  And, uh, to celebrate Samsung's appearance on Twitch.
[2162.00 --> 2164.00]  Oh, this is cool.
[2164.00 --> 2172.00]  All Samsung gaming monitors, including this one, the 49 inch QLED, are on sale from now until February 24th.
[2172.00 --> 2177.00]  Just go to link.twitch.tv slash Samsung and check it out today.
[2177.00 --> 2181.00]  So thanks to Samsung for sponsoring this episode.
[2181.00 --> 2188.00]  And also Twitch for featuring us on the freaking, uh, front page there.
[2188.00 --> 2190.00]  There's like 26,000 people watching.
[2190.00 --> 2192.00]  That cranked up average viewers just a little bit.
[2192.00 --> 2194.00]  I got, I got the pressure on me right now.
[2194.00 --> 2195.00]  I got pressure on me.
[2195.00 --> 2196.00]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[2196.00 --> 2197.00]  Just come over here and do it.
[2197.00 --> 2199.00]  What's your, what's your problem, Colton?
[2199.00 --> 2200.00]  What's your, what's your problem?
[2200.00 --> 2201.00]  Can we move this at all?
[2201.00 --> 2205.00]  You can move it a little, but you're probably, you're probably killing everybody's ears right now.
[2205.00 --> 2207.00]  A Twitch staff just sent us bits.
[2207.00 --> 2208.00]  Hey!
[2208.00 --> 2209.00]  No way!
[2209.00 --> 2211.00]  That's freaking awesome.
[2211.00 --> 2212.00]  What's up?
[2212.00 --> 2214.00]  What is going on with this?
[2214.00 --> 2215.00]  I don't, I don't know.
[2215.00 --> 2216.00]  The filter's not in a good spot anymore.
[2216.00 --> 2217.00]  You're killing me, Colton.
[2217.00 --> 2218.00]  I think it's fine.
[2218.00 --> 2220.00]  I don't think it does anything from this distance anyway.
[2220.00 --> 2221.00]  All right.
[2221.00 --> 2223.00]  So, oh, oh, don't touch the mic.
[2223.00 --> 2224.00]  Don't touch the mic!
[2224.00 --> 2225.00]  All right.
[2225.00 --> 2228.00]  So let's move into some other good stuff here.
[2228.00 --> 2229.00]  Oh, oh, I, okay.
[2229.00 --> 2230.00]  I'm sorry.
[2230.00 --> 2232.00]  I know this is a real downer for you.
[2232.00 --> 2233.00]  What?
[2233.00 --> 2235.00]  Um, I'm really sorry to bring this up.
[2235.00 --> 2238.00]  This was originally posted by Ryan Vickers on the forum.
[2238.00 --> 2239.00]  What?
[2239.00 --> 2240.00]  What?
[2240.00 --> 2241.00]  Office 2019.
[2241.00 --> 2242.00]  I'm heartbroken.
[2242.00 --> 2249.00]  It's going to ship in the second half of 2018, which makes perfect sense, of course, already.
[2249.00 --> 2250.00]  Yeah, it does.
[2250.00 --> 2251.00]  Yep.
[2251.00 --> 2253.00]  And it will only be available for Windows 10.
[2253.00 --> 2255.00]  That really, see, that just bugs me.
[2255.00 --> 2256.00]  It bugs me too much.
[2256.00 --> 2257.00]  I can't handle it.
[2257.00 --> 2258.00]  I can't handle it.
[2258.00 --> 2260.00]  So this is what I want to know.
[2260.00 --> 2261.00]  I need my office.
[2261.00 --> 2262.00]  Okay.
[2262.00 --> 2263.00]  You first.
[2263.00 --> 2267.00]  You, okay, so we have Office 365 subscriptions for our office.
[2267.00 --> 2268.00]  Yeah.
[2268.00 --> 2273.00]  Um, so it's always like installing these updates.
[2273.00 --> 2275.00]  What do they do?
[2275.00 --> 2282.00]  And I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything.
[2282.00 --> 2289.00]  But literally the only thing that has changed about the office installation on my computer
[2289.00 --> 2295.00]  in the last year has been that now when I go to open it, a lot of the time it just crashes
[2295.00 --> 2296.00]  instantly and doesn't open.
[2296.00 --> 2301.00]  And I'm not the only one in the office having this problem.
[2301.00 --> 2303.00]  And it's gotten better in the last few days.
[2303.00 --> 2305.00]  But they didn't apply an update.
[2305.00 --> 2308.00]  So I don't know what's going on.
[2308.00 --> 2309.00]  I don't know.
[2309.00 --> 2310.00]  What is it?
[2310.00 --> 2313.00]  Also like, it's Word and Excel.
[2313.00 --> 2315.00]  So it was fine.
[2315.00 --> 2317.00]  What is it that Office doesn't already do?
[2317.00 --> 2318.00]  Yeah.
[2318.00 --> 2319.00]  Like, I...
[2319.00 --> 2321.00]  We are also, okay, we are not...
[2321.00 --> 2322.00]  We are not power users.
[2322.00 --> 2323.00]  Yeah.
[2323.00 --> 2324.00]  Yeah.
[2324.00 --> 2328.00]  And especially of Excel, I'm sure there's people that are like, I want this new feature
[2328.00 --> 2330.00]  because Excel is a really deep, powerful program.
[2330.00 --> 2332.00]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[2332.00 --> 2333.00]  But I don't know, man.
[2333.00 --> 2334.00]  Anyway, okay, fine.
[2334.00 --> 2337.00]  Let's go through our talking points here.
[2337.00 --> 2342.00]  An update by Microsoft on the 1st of February noted that it will arrive and it will only run
[2342.00 --> 2343.00]  blah, blah, blah.
[2343.00 --> 2349.00]  Microsoft says, software that is more than a decade old and hasn't benefited from this innovation
[2349.00 --> 2353.00]  is difficult to secure and inherently less productive.
[2353.00 --> 2354.00]  It's definitely not less productive.
[2354.00 --> 2356.00]  It's way less productive to use Windows 10.
[2356.00 --> 2362.00]  As the pace of change accelerates, it has become imperative to move our software to a more
[2362.00 --> 2363.00]  modern cadence.
[2363.00 --> 2364.00]  Okay.
[2364.00 --> 2366.00]  I can, okay, I can understand.
[2366.00 --> 2367.00]  Part of this is...
[2367.00 --> 2368.00]  Okay, this is interesting.
[2368.00 --> 2370.00]  They're cutting off all the other ones?
[2370.00 --> 2372.00]  Because that sounds like they're talking about Windows 7.
[2372.00 --> 2375.00]  It won't be shipping with the older MSI installer.
[2375.00 --> 2376.00]  Okay.
[2376.00 --> 2379.00]  The apps will all use the click-to-run installer.
[2379.00 --> 2380.00]  Oh.
[2380.00 --> 2382.00]  Which is commonly used by Office 365.
[2382.00 --> 2385.00]  Here's a gripe about Office 365.
[2385.00 --> 2386.00]  Wow.
[2386.00 --> 2389.00]  Microsoft is going to be taking a beating during this particular thing.
[2389.00 --> 2392.00]  So, it's not because I'm an idiot.
[2392.00 --> 2396.00]  If I set some time aside to deal with it, I'm sure I could figure it out and it wouldn't
[2396.00 --> 2397.00]  take me that long.
[2397.00 --> 2399.00]  But I have a Skype account.
[2399.00 --> 2402.00]  But Skype and Skype for Business shouldn't be called...
[2402.00 --> 2405.00]  They shouldn't both have Skype in the name because they are completely different pieces
[2405.00 --> 2406.00]  of software.
[2406.00 --> 2407.00]  Oh, yeah.
[2407.00 --> 2408.00]  They're using completely different backgrounds.
[2408.00 --> 2409.00]  Yeah.
[2409.00 --> 2410.00]  Or backgrounds.
[2410.00 --> 2411.00]  Backends.
[2411.00 --> 2412.00]  Backends.
[2412.00 --> 2413.00]  For completely different purposes.
[2413.00 --> 2414.00]  Yeah.
[2414.00 --> 2415.00]  Other than that, they're both for communication.
[2415.00 --> 2416.00]  So, I have a Skype account.
[2416.00 --> 2422.00]  And I have Skype for Business on my computer because it is installed with Office 365.
[2422.00 --> 2423.00]  Now, here's a problem.
[2423.00 --> 2428.00]  On my desktop, Skype for Business automatically launches every time I turn on my computer because,
[2428.00 --> 2435.00]  like, I had to use some external company that I had to have a call with, use Skype for
[2435.00 --> 2437.00]  Business and that was the only thing I could use.
[2437.00 --> 2438.00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2438.00 --> 2439.00]  So, I had to get Skype for Business.
[2439.00 --> 2440.00]  Discord's really hard.
[2440.00 --> 2442.00]  Never ended up actually, like, getting logged into it.
[2442.00 --> 2443.00]  Nobody understands Discord.
[2443.00 --> 2447.00]  Because that was when I figured out this whole, oh, that account doesn't work for that
[2447.00 --> 2448.00]  one.
[2448.00 --> 2449.00]  Okay.
[2449.00 --> 2450.00]  I guess I'll...
[2450.00 --> 2451.00]  Okay.
[2451.00 --> 2452.00]  I don't know what to do.
[2452.00 --> 2455.00]  And for some reason, my account that I use to log in for my admin console, that doesn't
[2455.00 --> 2456.00]  work for it.
[2456.00 --> 2457.00]  Okay.
[2457.00 --> 2459.00]  So, I just wasn't sure what it was.
[2459.00 --> 2464.00]  But it's set to automatically launch and Skype, I don't know if you've ever encountered this,
[2464.00 --> 2469.00]  Skype for Business doesn't allow you to change any settings of the program, including auto
[2469.00 --> 2472.00]  launch preferences, unless you log in.
[2472.00 --> 2473.00]  Yeah.
[2473.00 --> 2479.00]  So, every time my computer restarts because of an automated Windows update, even if I didn't
[2479.00 --> 2480.00]  want it, thank you very much.
[2480.00 --> 2481.00]  And I know I could change...
[2481.00 --> 2482.00]  You can disable that.
[2482.00 --> 2485.00]  I know, I know, but updates are actually important.
[2485.00 --> 2486.00]  They are.
[2486.00 --> 2493.00]  Every time I do it, Skype for Business launches, and you can't just right click and close Skype
[2493.00 --> 2494.00]  at the bottom.
[2494.00 --> 2497.00]  You can't right click the thing and quit Skype.
[2497.00 --> 2498.00]  Are you sure?
[2498.00 --> 2499.00]  Yes, I'm...
[2499.00 --> 2501.00]  Are you sure you want to quit Skype?
[2501.00 --> 2502.00]  Yes, I'm sure.
[2502.00 --> 2503.00]  Yes, I'm sure.
[2503.00 --> 2507.00]  So, that's a complaint about Office 365, that I'm sure there's an easy solution to with
[2507.00 --> 2510.00]  a registry edit, but I just haven't had, like...
[2510.00 --> 2515.00]  Every time my computer reboots, I'm like, oh, I need to do something.
[2515.00 --> 2517.00]  Like, I sit down at my computer because I have to use it.
[2517.00 --> 2520.00]  Not because I feel like tooling around with Skype.
[2520.00 --> 2521.00]  This is my work computer.
[2521.00 --> 2522.00]  Anyway, so...
[2522.00 --> 2527.00]  My thing is just the constantly reinitiated telemetry stuff where you turn it all off,
[2527.00 --> 2530.00]  and then they're like, Windows update, it's back on, get owned!
[2530.00 --> 2532.00]  Is pretty annoying.
[2532.00 --> 2535.00]  There's some new telemetry stuff where they're like telling you what they're sending or something.
[2535.00 --> 2538.00]  I haven't looked into it, but John did a fast as possible on it.
[2538.00 --> 2540.00]  They're just still doing it though.
[2540.00 --> 2543.00]  So, there's that.
[2543.00 --> 2547.00]  And then, like, there's things that I just really don't like about the usability of it.
[2547.00 --> 2548.00]  That adds a lot of steps.
[2548.00 --> 2550.00]  Like, we talked not that long ago about the...
[2550.00 --> 2551.00]  The network thing.
[2551.00 --> 2554.00]  And there is, like, an easier way, but they just, like, moved it.
[2554.00 --> 2556.00]  And it didn't feel like there was a compelling reason to do that.
[2556.00 --> 2557.00]  And it's less conventional now.
[2557.00 --> 2559.00]  Like, there's a lot...
[2559.00 --> 2563.00]  There's more clicks, there's more steps, they're really heavy UI elements.
[2563.00 --> 2565.00]  Some people might think they look good.
[2565.00 --> 2566.00]  I personally don't.
[2566.00 --> 2567.00]  You're such a nerd.
[2567.00 --> 2568.00]  They have heavy UI elements.
[2568.00 --> 2569.00]  They do.
[2569.00 --> 2570.00]  Which you're right about.
[2570.00 --> 2572.00]  But it's just such a nerd complaint.
[2572.00 --> 2573.00]  But they break a lot.
[2573.00 --> 2575.00]  These UI elements, very heavy.
[2575.00 --> 2576.00]  And there is design issues with them.
[2576.00 --> 2578.00]  Like, you didn't know those were buttons.
[2578.00 --> 2579.00]  Yes.
[2579.00 --> 2580.00]  Like...
[2580.00 --> 2581.00]  Ugh.
[2581.00 --> 2582.00]  So...
[2582.00 --> 2583.00]  The start menu being broken for...
[2583.00 --> 2585.00]  It has been good for a long time now, by the way.
[2585.00 --> 2586.00]  Okay.
[2586.00 --> 2588.00]  But the start menu being broken for literally over a year was laughable.
[2588.00 --> 2589.00]  Yeah.
[2589.00 --> 2591.00]  Like, basic functionality just hasn't been there.
[2591.00 --> 2592.00]  So I've been staying off.
[2592.00 --> 2595.00]  But they're talking about things more than a decade old.
[2595.00 --> 2596.00]  Software that is more than a decade old.
[2596.00 --> 2597.00]  So they're talking about Windows 7.
[2597.00 --> 2598.00]  Yeah.
[2598.00 --> 2599.00]  Yeah.
[2599.00 --> 2601.00]  Because that's what a huge amount of users are still using.
[2601.00 --> 2602.00]  Yes.
[2602.00 --> 2603.00]  Because Windows 10 has many problems.
[2603.00 --> 2604.00]  Um...
[2604.00 --> 2606.00]  What about the other ones?
[2606.00 --> 2609.00]  Did you just forget that you released other operating systems?
[2609.00 --> 2610.00]  Yeah, apparently.
[2610.00 --> 2611.00]  That aren't that old?
[2611.00 --> 2612.00]  8.1 is like, not bad.
[2612.00 --> 2613.00]  Yeah.
[2613.00 --> 2614.00]  Yeah.
[2614.00 --> 2615.00]  Especially the embedded one.
[2615.00 --> 2616.00]  Yeah.
[2616.00 --> 2619.00]  We use 8.1 embedded on our final render server.
[2619.00 --> 2625.00]  The one that actually has an overclocked 10 core extreme edition in it.
[2625.00 --> 2627.00]  Because that's server, right?
[2627.00 --> 2630.00]  And water cooling in a 2U.
[2630.00 --> 2631.00]  Don't worry about it.
[2631.00 --> 2632.00]  Anyway, the point is...
[2632.00 --> 2633.00]  It's fine.
[2633.00 --> 2634.00]  We use 8.1 embedded.
[2634.00 --> 2636.00]  I don't think that machine has ever failed in export.
[2636.00 --> 2637.00]  No.
[2637.00 --> 2639.00]  And the embedded versions are awesome.
[2639.00 --> 2645.00]  And then the proper, chopped down version of Windows 10, they don't want you to buy it.
[2645.00 --> 2646.00]  You have to be on a subscription.
[2646.00 --> 2647.00]  You're only allowed to get the subscription if you're a business.
[2647.00 --> 2648.00]  Well, it was the same with 8.1.
[2648.00 --> 2649.00]  It was almost impossible to get it.
[2649.00 --> 2650.00]  Yeah.
[2650.00 --> 2654.00]  The only reason we got it was because we know someone who knows someone who obtained a key.
[2654.00 --> 2655.00]  Yeah.
[2655.00 --> 2656.00]  Um...
[2656.00 --> 2657.00]  It is what it is.
[2657.00 --> 2658.00]  I mean, by and large, we...
[2658.00 --> 2661.00]  The best version of their operating system, they're just like, no, you guys don't get it.
[2661.00 --> 2664.00]  By and large, we run legit versions of Windows.
[2664.00 --> 2665.00]  We have Office 365.
[2665.00 --> 2667.00]  Microsoft gets a ton of our money.
[2667.00 --> 2670.00]  But, um, maybe this will get me in trouble, I guess.
[2670.00 --> 2675.00]  But on that one machine, I am running a copy of Windows that I didn't buy.
[2675.00 --> 2676.00]  Because I can't buy it.
[2676.00 --> 2677.00]  Right.
[2677.00 --> 2678.00]  Yeah.
[2678.00 --> 2681.00]  If they were willing to sell it to me, I would gladly pay for it.
[2681.00 --> 2682.00]  Yeah.
[2682.00 --> 2684.00]  Anyway, let's move on.
[2684.00 --> 2690.00]  Key iPhone source code leak gets posted online in, and I quote,
[2690.00 --> 2693.00]  the biggest leak in history.
[2693.00 --> 2694.00]  Oh my.
[2694.00 --> 2695.00]  Dun, dun, dun.
[2695.00 --> 2696.00]  Dun, dun.
[2696.00 --> 2698.00]  The biggest leak in Apple history?
[2698.00 --> 2706.00]  So, the source code for a core component of the iPhone's operating system, iBoot, was posted on GitHub.
[2706.00 --> 2708.00]  So, here's the implications.
[2708.00 --> 2711.00]  Thank you, Shreyas1, for posting this.
[2711.00 --> 2716.00]  This could give hackers an easier time finding flaws and bugs that could allow them to crack or decrypt an iPhone.
[2716.00 --> 2721.00]  I don't know how they would decrypt it, given that this wouldn't tell them anything about the security element, or secure element, rather.
[2721.00 --> 2725.00]  Could eventually allow advanced programmers to emulate iOS on non-Apple platforms.
[2725.00 --> 2730.00]  That would be so helpful.
[2730.00 --> 2731.00]  That would be freaking awesome.
[2731.00 --> 2732.00]  Oh my god.
[2732.00 --> 2733.00]  That would be so good.
[2733.00 --> 2736.00]  It could make iPhone jailbreaks easier to achieve.
[2736.00 --> 2740.00]  It's already pretty easy.
[2740.00 --> 2742.00]  Am I overselling this?
[2742.00 --> 2743.00]  No.
[2743.00 --> 2744.00]  Keep going.
[2744.00 --> 2745.00]  My sadness?
[2745.00 --> 2746.00]  100%.
[2746.00 --> 2747.00]  Continue.
[2747.00 --> 2748.00]  The GitHub code...
[2748.00 --> 2749.00]  The GitHub!
[2749.00 --> 2750.00]  Yeah.
[2750.00 --> 2752.00]  Is labeled iBoot, which is like the iPhone's BIOS, kind of.
[2752.00 --> 2755.00]  And it's the first process that runs on your iPhone.
[2755.00 --> 2759.00]  So, it loads and verifies the kernel, and makes sure it is properly signed by Apple, then executes.
[2759.00 --> 2764.00]  The code says it's for iOS 9, but portions of it are likely still in use in iOS 11.
[2764.00 --> 2766.00]  I mean, you look at any...
[2766.00 --> 2771.00]  You don't rewrite an operating system from scratch, from one year to another.
[2771.00 --> 2777.00]  And Apple has taken particular care to keep iBoot secure and its code private.
[2777.00 --> 2782.00]  Bugs in the boot process are the most valuable ones, if reported to Apple through its bounty program,
[2782.00 --> 2785.00]  which values them at a max payment of $200,000.
[2785.00 --> 2788.00]  To be clear, I seriously doubt they've ever paid out $200k.
[2788.00 --> 2789.00]  Right.
[2789.00 --> 2791.00]  And I doubt they ever really will, but that's the max payment.
[2791.00 --> 2792.00]  You're getting somewhere in there.
[2792.00 --> 2793.00]  You're getting money.
[2793.00 --> 2794.00]  Yeah.
[2794.00 --> 2795.00]  You're getting good money.
[2795.00 --> 2800.00]  A few hours after the publication, Apple sent a DMCA takedown, demanding GitHub take down
[2800.00 --> 2801.00]  the boot code.
[2801.00 --> 2802.00]  Good luck with that.
[2802.00 --> 2803.00]  What's that called?
[2803.00 --> 2805.00]  The what effect again?
[2805.00 --> 2806.00]  The Strysand effect.
[2806.00 --> 2807.00]  Yes, yes.
[2807.00 --> 2810.00]  So, like, I guarantee it's everywhere already.
[2810.00 --> 2811.00]  Yeah.
[2811.00 --> 2812.00]  Yeah.
[2812.00 --> 2813.00]  Yeah, so they're saying the iBoot...
[2813.00 --> 2817.00]  GitHub might have even taken it down really fast, but the second anyone saw that, it was
[2817.00 --> 2818.00]  copied.
[2818.00 --> 2819.00]  Oh, yeah.
[2819.00 --> 2820.00]  And it's everywhere.
[2820.00 --> 2821.00]  Everywhere.
[2821.00 --> 2823.00]  Like the Stuxnet code, if you guys remember that.
[2823.00 --> 2824.00]  I don't remember that.
[2824.00 --> 2825.00]  Do you remember Stuxnet?
[2825.00 --> 2827.00]  I want to figure out the specifics so I don't get it wrong.
[2827.00 --> 2828.00]  Sure.
[2828.00 --> 2829.00]  So you can check that.
[2829.00 --> 2832.00]  Well, so the iBoot source code is proprietary, includes an Apple copyright notice.
[2832.00 --> 2836.00]  It is not open source, said their message.
[2836.00 --> 2843.00]  So, it first surfaced last year, apparently, posted by a Reddit user called apple underscore
[2843.00 --> 2845.00]  internals on the jailbreak subreddit.
[2845.00 --> 2848.00]  The post didn't get much attention though, since the user was new and didn't have enough
[2848.00 --> 2849.00]  Reddit karma.
[2849.00 --> 2854.00]  The new availability on GitHub means it is circulating much more widely in the underground jailbreaking
[2854.00 --> 2856.00]  community and in iOS hacking circles.
[2856.00 --> 2863.00]  Okay, so Stuxnet was a malicious computer worm first uncovered in 2010 by Kaspersky Lab,
[2863.00 --> 2868.00]  and it was responsible for causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program.
[2868.00 --> 2869.00]  Oh, okay.
[2869.00 --> 2875.00]  It was one of the first worms to directly cause physical damage.
[2875.00 --> 2876.00]  Interesting.
[2876.00 --> 2879.00]  And the code is out there.
[2879.00 --> 2881.00]  I may or may not have it in a zip.
[2881.00 --> 2883.00]  Like, it's everywhere.
[2883.00 --> 2884.00]  Okay.
[2884.00 --> 2890.00]  So, this is either great news if you're into the iOS hacking scene or terrible news if
[2890.00 --> 2895.00]  you're Apple and you're now going to be trying to figure out how to basically replace this.
[2895.00 --> 2896.00]  Yeah, that's a nightmare.
[2896.00 --> 2902.00]  Because I don't really see what they could do other than rewrite significant portions of
[2902.00 --> 2905.00]  it to make it very, very, very different.
[2905.00 --> 2906.00]  Yeah.
[2906.00 --> 2912.00]  It's also a big hit to the company's, like, I don't even know what to call it.
[2912.00 --> 2914.00]  Well, they're security image.
[2914.00 --> 2915.00]  Yeah.
[2915.00 --> 2919.00]  I mean, that's one of the big things that Apple trades on is that we take privacy and we take
[2919.00 --> 2921.00]  security really seriously and we're good at this stuff.
[2921.00 --> 2922.00]  And this is a big hit.
[2922.00 --> 2927.00]  You know, trust us with all this data, including your pins and your fingerprints and your credit
[2927.00 --> 2929.00]  card data and a facial scan.
[2929.00 --> 2930.00]  Yeah.
[2930.00 --> 2931.00]  Trust us with all this stuff.
[2931.00 --> 2932.00]  We got this.
[2932.00 --> 2934.00]  And this is a pretty big leak.
[2934.00 --> 2940.00]  Now, in fairness to Apple, this type of a leak is very different from that type of data
[2940.00 --> 2945.00]  and the way that they say that they handle it, where it's stored in a secure element inside
[2945.00 --> 2947.00]  your physical device and everything gets sent to them.
[2947.00 --> 2948.00]  Yeah.
[2948.00 --> 2955.00]  Like, that's the difference between security as a design and security as a, you know, building
[2955.00 --> 2958.00]  with, you know, people standing by the doors like this.
[2958.00 --> 2962.00]  Like a secure design is not the same as like having good security on your campus.
[2962.00 --> 2963.00]  Yeah.
[2963.00 --> 2968.00]  But it still is the kind of thing that people might not necessarily know how to interpret.
[2968.00 --> 2976.00]  So, in other news, Russian nuclear scientists arrested for Bitcoin mining plot.
[2976.00 --> 2979.00]  This was posted by Ginger137 on the forum.
[2979.00 --> 2981.00]  And this is freaking hilarious.
[2981.00 --> 2982.00]  Oh.
[2982.00 --> 2992.00]  The arrested scientists worked at the secret factory which made the USSR's first nuclear bomb.
[2992.00 --> 2997.00]  So, we're talking people that had that security clearance.
[2997.00 --> 2998.00]  Okay?
[2998.00 --> 3002.00]  So, do you want to go through this?
[3002.00 --> 3004.00]  This was originally posted on BBC.
[3004.00 --> 3009.00]  They used one of Russia's most powerful supercomputers to mine Bitcoin.
[3009.00 --> 3012.00]  The supercomputer was not supposed to be connected to the internet.
[3012.00 --> 3013.00]  They tried to.
[3013.00 --> 3014.00]  They tried to.
[3014.00 --> 3015.00]  Yeah.
[3015.00 --> 3016.00]  Yeah.
[3016.00 --> 3017.00]  Did I say they did?
[3017.00 --> 3018.00]  You said they did.
[3018.00 --> 3019.00]  Okay, my bad.
[3019.00 --> 3023.00]  The supercomputer was not supposed to be connected to the internet to prevent intrusion, which makes sense.
[3023.00 --> 3029.00]  And once the scientists attempted to do so, the nuclear center's security department was alerted and the scientists arrested.
[3029.00 --> 3031.00]  So, they really didn't get far.
[3033.00 --> 3034.00]  Like at all.
[3036.00 --> 3037.00]  Oh, man.
[3037.00 --> 3041.00]  There have been reports of some other industrial facilities in Russia being used for crypto mining.
[3041.00 --> 3046.00]  And one businessman reportedly bought two power stations for the activity.
[3046.00 --> 3048.00]  Buying power stations.
[3048.00 --> 3049.00]  That is next level.
[3049.00 --> 3051.00]  Like legitimately red alert 2.
[3051.00 --> 3052.00]  That is next level.
[3052.00 --> 3054.00]  Like red alert Bitcoin edition.
[3056.00 --> 3057.00]  So, that.
[3057.00 --> 3058.00]  Mine Bitcoin.
[3058.00 --> 3059.00]  Use the things to build power stations.
[3059.00 --> 3060.00]  Mine more Bitcoin.
[3061.00 --> 3062.00]  So, that's pretty funny.
[3063.00 --> 3066.00]  In other news, this is posted by HeyYo on the forum.
[3066.00 --> 3067.00]  HeyYo.
[3067.00 --> 3068.00]  This article is from CNET.
[3068.00 --> 3070.00]  The first phone with a...
[3070.00 --> 3071.00]  Oh, dang it.
[3071.00 --> 3072.00]  I did it again.
[3072.00 --> 3077.00]  The first phone with a diamond screen will come in 2019.
[3077.00 --> 3079.00]  So, finally, diamond...
[3079.00 --> 3080.00]  I did it again.
[3080.00 --> 3081.00]  Sorry.
[3081.00 --> 3082.00]  Fuck.
[3082.00 --> 3083.00]  I keep playing the intro.
[3083.00 --> 3090.00]  So, finally, diamond will have a real legitimate use that makes it valuable.
[3090.00 --> 3091.00]  Well, you know that...
[3091.00 --> 3092.00]  Well, okay.
[3092.00 --> 3097.00]  It has legitimate uses like being put on cutting blades or whatever else the case may be or abrasives.
[3097.00 --> 3103.00]  But the whole thing with like raw, like mined diamonds being worth lots of money.
[3103.00 --> 3104.00]  Oh, yeah.
[3104.00 --> 3105.00]  That whole thing is a construct.
[3105.00 --> 3108.00]  For those of you who are watching out there who don't know...
[3108.00 --> 3109.00]  What absolutely is.
[3109.00 --> 3110.00]  I bought into it.
[3111.00 --> 3120.00]  There's a high probability that you'll buy into it or you'll have to buy into it because someone has your arm behind your back and they're pulling it up in a dirk in motion.
[3121.00 --> 3122.00]  Yep.
[3122.00 --> 3123.00]  But it's a big scam.
[3123.00 --> 3125.00]  They're not worth anything.
[3125.00 --> 3127.00]  They're just shiny pebbles.
[3127.00 --> 3128.00]  Okay?
[3128.00 --> 3130.00]  They're really valuable for putting on like saw blades.
[3130.00 --> 3134.00]  I've spent literally thousands of dollars on these shiny pebbles.
[3134.00 --> 3136.00]  And someday you might too.
[3137.00 --> 3138.00]  It's a sad day.
[3138.00 --> 3139.00]  It's a sad day.
[3139.00 --> 3141.00]  And you know what?
[3141.00 --> 3143.00]  Focus instead on the happy day.
[3143.00 --> 3144.00]  The wedding day.
[3144.00 --> 3146.00]  Not the sad day with the money.
[3146.00 --> 3148.00]  Which is also probably a financially sad day.
[3148.00 --> 3149.00]  Yeah.
[3149.00 --> 3150.00]  Just ignore that.
[3150.00 --> 3152.00]  No, depends how you roll it.
[3152.00 --> 3153.00]  You guys did really well.
[3153.00 --> 3154.00]  We made money.
[3154.00 --> 3155.00]  Yeah.
[3155.00 --> 3156.00]  Okay?
[3156.00 --> 3157.00]  Yeah.
[3157.00 --> 3158.00]  So...
[3158.00 --> 3159.00]  That's impressive.
[3159.00 --> 3160.00]  Most people don't.
[3160.00 --> 3161.00]  Most people did not marry my wife.
[3162.00 --> 3163.00]  Okay?
[3163.00 --> 3166.00]  She flipped her wedding dress for a profit.
[3166.00 --> 3167.00]  Chair covers?
[3167.00 --> 3168.00]  Profit.
[3168.00 --> 3169.00]  Center pieces?
[3169.00 --> 3170.00]  Profit.
[3170.00 --> 3171.00]  Okay?
[3171.00 --> 3174.00]  She flipped that shit for a profit.
[3175.00 --> 3177.00]  She's incredible.
[3177.00 --> 3178.00]  That's pretty epic.
[3178.00 --> 3179.00]  Yeah.
[3179.00 --> 3180.00]  Anyway.
[3180.00 --> 3181.00]  Um...
[3181.00 --> 3182.00]  The other great thing.
[3182.00 --> 3184.00]  These are probably gonna be lab grown diamonds.
[3184.00 --> 3185.00]  Yeah.
[3185.00 --> 3190.00]  So even then, the ones that come from the ground still suck.
[3190.00 --> 3191.00]  So, um...
[3191.00 --> 3199.00]  Akhan Semiconductor's Mirage Diamond Glass promises to be stronger than other materials used to cover a phone's display today.
[3199.00 --> 3200.00]  Sure.
[3200.00 --> 3202.00]  The diamond glass uses a nano crystal pattern.
[3202.00 --> 3203.00]  I swear.
[3203.00 --> 3207.00]  Nano has to be actually the biggest buzzword.
[3207.00 --> 3208.00]  No.
[3208.00 --> 3209.00]  Blockchain.
[3209.00 --> 3210.00]  But...
[3210.00 --> 3211.00]  No.
[3211.00 --> 3212.00]  Yeah.
[3212.00 --> 3213.00]  Nano blockchain.
[3213.00 --> 3214.00]  No.
[3214.00 --> 3215.00]  Because the thing about nano is it's just a prefix.
[3215.00 --> 3216.00]  Yeah.
[3216.00 --> 3217.00]  So it can be on nano tubes.
[3217.00 --> 3218.00]  It can be on nano cell.
[3218.00 --> 3219.00]  Nano blockchain.
[3219.00 --> 3220.00]  Nano fricking anything.
[3220.00 --> 3221.00]  Nano blockchain industries.
[3221.00 --> 3222.00]  Nano blockchain is gonna be like...
[3222.00 --> 3223.00]  That company's IPO.
[3223.00 --> 3224.00]  Pfft.
[3224.00 --> 3225.00]  Nano blockchain industries.
[3225.00 --> 3226.00]  Okay.
[3226.00 --> 3228.00]  It all runs on your phone.
[3228.00 --> 3229.00]  Yeah.
[3229.00 --> 3230.00]  Anyway.
[3230.00 --> 3237.00]  The point is it uses a nano crystal pattern that randomly arranges the crystals instead of lining them up along their crystal planes.
[3237.00 --> 3241.00]  So that discourages deep cracks from forming and damaging the materials underneath.
[3241.00 --> 3242.00]  It can actually...
[3242.00 --> 3243.00]  This is cool.
[3243.00 --> 3247.00]  It can be applied in conjunction with other materials like Gorilla Glass as a top layer.
[3247.00 --> 3251.00]  Their CEO promised that we'd see the first device by the end of 2017.
[3251.00 --> 3254.00]  Twitch Plays Pokemon came up with the best one so far.
[3254.00 --> 3255.00]  He said nano block...
[3255.00 --> 3256.00]  A nano quantum blockchain.
[3256.00 --> 3257.00]  Yes.
[3257.00 --> 3258.00]  Yeah.
[3258.00 --> 3259.00]  Yes.
[3259.00 --> 3260.00]  Thank you.
[3260.00 --> 3261.00]  Yeah.
[3261.00 --> 3262.00]  Now they're aiming for 2019.
[3262.00 --> 3265.00]  So like anything with nano in it, it's delayed.
[3265.00 --> 3266.00]  Yeah.
[3266.00 --> 3273.00]  The technology is being actively tested with as yet unidentified device makers and they are stress testing its strength,
[3273.00 --> 3283.00]  trying to reduce glare, and making sure the surface transmits electrical signals well so that your fingers can navigate the touch screen without a glitch.
[3285.00 --> 3286.00]  What else we got?
[3287.00 --> 3288.00]  This is all boring.
[3288.00 --> 3289.00]  Yeah.
[3289.00 --> 3290.00]  Boring.
[3290.00 --> 3291.00]  Yeah.
[3291.00 --> 3292.00]  Boring.
[3292.00 --> 3293.00]  Boring.
[3293.00 --> 3294.00]  Boring.
[3294.00 --> 3295.00]  This is all boring.
[3295.00 --> 3296.00]  Let's just...
[3296.00 --> 3298.00]  Let's go on the forum and find our own news.
[3298.00 --> 3299.00]  Or we could talk about...
[3299.00 --> 3300.00]  That thing!
[3300.00 --> 3301.00]  We could talk about float plane stuff.
[3301.00 --> 3303.00]  We could also talk about that thing.
[3303.00 --> 3304.00]  What thing?
[3304.00 --> 3305.00]  The creepy faces.
[3305.00 --> 3306.00]  What are you talking about?
[3306.00 --> 3307.00]  Oh, that?
[3307.00 --> 3308.00]  Oh, gross.
[3308.00 --> 3309.00]  Where is that?
[3309.00 --> 3310.00]  That's right.
[3310.00 --> 3311.00]  I can post it in the chat.
[3311.00 --> 3312.00]  Yeah, post it in the chat.
[3312.00 --> 3313.00]  I'll grab it from there.
[3313.00 --> 3314.00]  Okay.
[3314.00 --> 3317.00]  So AI is getting frickin' scary.
[3317.00 --> 3325.00]  Now, there was a period for a while there where face swaps between me and Luke were kind of a meme on the forum.
[3325.00 --> 3326.00]  Yeah.
[3326.00 --> 3327.00]  And you know what?
[3327.00 --> 3330.00]  Actually, send it to me in Hangouts if you can.
[3330.00 --> 3331.00]  Okay.
[3331.00 --> 3332.00]  Then post it in the chat.
[3332.00 --> 3333.00]  I might be able to.
[3333.00 --> 3334.00]  I'll try and grab it.
[3334.00 --> 3335.00]  Yeah, I can.
[3335.00 --> 3336.00]  Okay.
[3336.00 --> 3337.00]  Where is it?
[3337.00 --> 3338.00]  Have you posted it in the chat yet?
[3338.00 --> 3339.00]  No.
[3339.00 --> 3340.00]  Oh, okay.
[3340.00 --> 3341.00]  I'm loading up Hangouts right now.
[3341.00 --> 3342.00]  Okay, perfect.
[3342.00 --> 3343.00]  That works.
[3343.00 --> 3348.00]  So let's load up some Linus and Luke face swaps because this was some creepy stuff that was going on for a bit there.
[3348.00 --> 3349.00]  And it was...
[3349.00 --> 3350.00]  Yeah, it's pretty scary.
[3350.00 --> 3352.00]  So, you know, here's one.
[3352.00 --> 3356.00]  Like that, that is some gross.
[3356.00 --> 3359.00]  That is some gross face swappage right there.
[3359.00 --> 3362.00]  No offense to you, but I'm glad I don't have your face.
[3362.00 --> 3363.00]  Yeah, no.
[3363.00 --> 3364.00]  Yeah.
[3364.00 --> 3365.00]  Like, as long as...
[3365.00 --> 3367.00]  I think it's like always worse in that direction.
[3367.00 --> 3370.00]  Um, wow, like none of them are showing up.
[3370.00 --> 3372.00]  They're a little old at this point.
[3372.00 --> 3374.00]  There was, it was really trendy in like probably 20...
[3374.00 --> 3377.00]  Late 2013, early 2014.
[3377.00 --> 3378.00]  Huh.
[3378.00 --> 3379.00]  Yeah.
[3379.00 --> 3380.00]  Really?
[3380.00 --> 3384.00]  If they swap this picture, it's probably the same one.
[3386.00 --> 3387.00]  It's gone.
[3387.00 --> 3388.00]  Yeah.
[3388.00 --> 3389.00]  Wow.
[3389.00 --> 3390.00]  This was like...
[3390.00 --> 3391.00]  Yeah, 2014.
[3391.00 --> 3392.00]  Early 2014.
[3392.00 --> 3394.00]  Yeah, early 2014, late 2013.
[3394.00 --> 3395.00]  That was four years ago.
[3395.00 --> 3397.00]  Okay, that's a whole other thing right there.
[3397.00 --> 3399.00]  No, can you see?
[3399.00 --> 3400.00]  Oh my.
[3400.00 --> 3401.00]  Oh my.
[3401.00 --> 3403.00]  Um, okay.
[3403.00 --> 3406.00]  Alright, alright.
[3406.00 --> 3408.00]  Anyway, anyway.
[3408.00 --> 3418.00]  So, thanks to deep learning, face swapping is no longer limited to still images.
[3418.00 --> 3419.00]  Did you post that in the chat?
[3419.00 --> 3420.00]  I sent it to you.
[3420.00 --> 3421.00]  You sent it to me?
[3421.00 --> 3422.00]  Okay, cool.
[3422.00 --> 3423.00]  I'll put it in chat.
[3423.00 --> 3424.00]  No, no, no, no.
[3424.00 --> 3425.00]  Hold on, hold on.
[3425.00 --> 3426.00]  Which one?
[3426.00 --> 3427.00]  Which one?
[3427.00 --> 3428.00]  Which one?
[3428.00 --> 3429.00]  Both.
[3429.00 --> 3430.00]  The first one first?
[3430.00 --> 3431.00]  Okay.
[3431.00 --> 3432.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3432.00 --> 3433.00]  Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[3433.00 --> 3434.00]  So, check this.
[3434.00 --> 3435.00]  Check this out, you guys.
[3435.00 --> 3436.00]  It needs kind of like a second to load it.
[3436.00 --> 3437.00]  No, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3437.00 --> 3438.00]  That's fine, that's fine.
[3438.00 --> 3439.00]  Okay.
[3439.00 --> 3441.00]  So, this is a normal Linus talking to the camera.
[3441.00 --> 3452.00]  This is over 2,000 frames of data processed with an image of Luke.
[3452.00 --> 3453.00]  So, it's, what is it?
[3453.00 --> 3464.00]  It's 2,000 frames, it's modeled, and then it's like processed over top to swap Luke's face onto my talking head.
[3464.00 --> 3467.00]  Now, I think we showed on the WAM show a little while ago.
[3467.00 --> 3468.00]  Hold on, one quick thing.
[3468.00 --> 3469.00]  Yeah.
[3469.00 --> 3477.00]  Someone using some footage of George W. Bush just kind of sitting still and like nodding along and moved his mouth and made him say stuff.
[3477.00 --> 3478.00]  Yeah.
[3478.00 --> 3480.00]  So, this is a very similar technology to that.
[3480.00 --> 3481.00]  So, how does this work?
[3481.00 --> 3495.00]  So, he says, I trained my model using 2,000 plus images each for you and Linus, pulled frames from float plane and YouTube videos to gather all the data, and trained my GTX 970 for 36 hours.
[3495.00 --> 3498.00]  So, it's a 970 for 36 hours and a whole bunch of photos.
[3498.00 --> 3499.00]  Okay.
[3499.00 --> 3500.00]  There's another one.
[3500.00 --> 3501.00]  There's another one.
[3501.00 --> 3502.00]  It's the other way around.
[3502.00 --> 3503.00]  Yeah.
[3503.00 --> 3505.00]  So, let's pull up the Linus and Luke one.
[3505.00 --> 3507.00]  Actually, here, you guys can see them side by side here.
[3507.00 --> 3510.00]  So, this is my face onto Luke.
[3510.00 --> 3517.00]  It is a surprisingly convincing effect.
[3517.00 --> 3522.00]  If the eyes, if the like iris was smaller, I think it would be more believable.
[3522.00 --> 3525.00]  I think that's the like one thing that it screwed up.
[3525.00 --> 3526.00]  Yeah.
[3526.00 --> 3530.00]  And well, that and the fact that like you have facial hair and I don't and it kind of blended it.
[3530.00 --> 3531.00]  Yeah.
[3531.00 --> 3532.00]  Rather than...
[3532.00 --> 3533.00]  Yeah.
[3533.00 --> 3535.00]  It did, okay, I think it actually did a pretty good job of that.
[3535.00 --> 3538.00]  It just looks unnatural for that face to have facial hair.
[3538.00 --> 3539.00]  Yes.
[3539.00 --> 3540.00]  It looks like this person should shave.
[3540.00 --> 3541.00]  Yeah.
[3541.00 --> 3542.00]  More than the other one.
[3542.00 --> 3546.00]  And like you can tell like these lines are higher up on your face.
[3546.00 --> 3547.00]  So, it looks a little weird.
[3547.00 --> 3548.00]  Yeah.
[3548.00 --> 3553.00]  But like, if I'd never seen either of us, I'd have gone like, okay, yeah, that's a dude.
[3553.00 --> 3556.00]  Especially at like kind of blocky web streaming quality.
[3556.00 --> 3557.00]  Yeah.
[3557.00 --> 3560.00]  And I did notice when looking at it myself when comparing the two.
[3560.00 --> 3561.00]  Yeah.
[3561.00 --> 3562.00]  I was like, okay, mine looks more unnatural.
[3562.00 --> 3565.00]  But that's probably because it's me looking at it.
[3565.00 --> 3566.00]  Probably.
[3566.00 --> 3567.00]  Like, I don't know.
[3567.00 --> 3568.00]  It's really interesting.
[3568.00 --> 3573.00]  I never realized how creepy Linus's eyes were, says Majestic Failure.
[3573.00 --> 3575.00]  Well, they don't look like that.
[3575.00 --> 3577.00]  It's trying to scale it.
[3577.00 --> 3579.00]  It's screwed up slightly, I think.
[3579.00 --> 3584.00]  So, the reason why this actually showed up is because three different websites.
[3584.00 --> 3585.00]  Yeah.
[3585.00 --> 3588.00]  I believe, I don't remember what they all were.
[3588.00 --> 3589.00]  Yeah.
[3589.00 --> 3590.00]  I know one of them is Discord.
[3590.00 --> 3595.00]  But they've blocked intentionally now like Discord would probably block this.
[3595.00 --> 3600.00]  But I know other sites are more tuned to normally having this type of content and they've blocked
[3600.00 --> 3601.00]  it as well.
[3601.00 --> 3606.00]  But it's porn where they've done this with like a celebrity's face.
[3606.00 --> 3607.00]  Yeah.
[3607.00 --> 3609.00]  And put it on an actor in a scene.
[3609.00 --> 3610.00]  Yeah.
[3610.00 --> 3612.00]  And that's like becoming a thing.
[3612.00 --> 3613.00]  Right.
[3613.00 --> 3615.00]  Like all these different sites, I believe Pornhub is one of them.
[3615.00 --> 3618.00]  I know Discord's one, but I didn't know that was a thing anyways.
[3618.00 --> 3619.00]  Right.
[3619.00 --> 3621.00]  And like, I think there's a couple other sites that are all like, nope!
[3621.00 --> 3624.00]  Because they don't want to deal with any of the legal issues, I'm sure.
[3624.00 --> 3625.00]  Well, yeah.
[3625.00 --> 3626.00]  And there'll be major issues.
[3626.00 --> 3632.00]  Especially because like, guys, even ignoring the like, I forget if it's defamation or libel,
[3632.00 --> 3633.00]  or slander.
[3633.00 --> 3634.00]  Yeah.
[3634.00 --> 3635.00]  Like, they're all slightly different.
[3635.00 --> 3637.00]  Like, one of them is written and one of them is spoken or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3637.00 --> 3638.00]  I think slander's spoken.
[3638.00 --> 3645.00]  Anyway, the point is, aside from being sued for damages over that, celebrities, especially
[3645.00 --> 3646.00]  like-
[3646.00 --> 3647.00]  Apparently they're called deepfakes.
[3647.00 --> 3648.00]  Okay.
[3648.00 --> 3649.00]  Like legitimately-
[3649.00 --> 3650.00]  Like deep learning fakes.
[3650.00 --> 3657.00]  Legitimately famous ones, they often are able to claim that their image, especially if
[3657.00 --> 3661.00]  it was pulled from a copyrighted work, is their IP.
[3661.00 --> 3662.00]  So-
[3662.00 --> 3667.00]  And you'll have a little bit, cause like, with some of these things it's community contributed
[3667.00 --> 3671.00]  content, so they're protected to a certain degree, but they have to get rid of it really
[3671.00 --> 3672.00]  fast.
[3672.00 --> 3673.00]  Yes.
[3673.00 --> 3678.00]  So they're trying to put fairly heavy handed, which is fair, not heavy handed in an unfair
[3678.00 --> 3682.00]  way, heavy handed in a this is definitely how they should do it way, rules in place
[3682.00 --> 3683.00]  to try to stop these things.
[3683.00 --> 3684.00]  Right.
[3684.00 --> 3685.00]  Yeah.
[3685.00 --> 3687.00]  All right.
[3687.00 --> 3690.00]  So, I think that's pretty much it for the show today.
[3690.00 --> 3695.00]  Thank you to all the ten- I can legitimately say for the first time, tens of thousands of
[3695.00 --> 3697.00]  you who are watching.
[3697.00 --> 3700.00]  Thanks to Samsung for sponsoring the show, and we will see you again next week.
[3700.00 --> 3702.00]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3702.00 --> 3703.00]  Bye.
[3703.00 --> 3704.00]  Okay.
[3704.00 --> 3706.00]  Oh dang it, I meant to roll the intro.
[3706.00 --> 3707.00]  Haha.
[3707.00 --> 3708.00]  Haha.
[3708.00 --> 3710.00]  Goes in with- Float plane!
[3710.00 --> 3711.00]  Oh crap.
[3711.00 --> 3712.00]  Stop it!
[3712.00 --> 3713.00]  We're back!
[3713.00 --> 3714.00]  Float plane!
[3714.00 --> 3715.00]  We're back!
[3715.00 --> 3716.00]  Whoa!
[3716.00 --> 3717.00]  Hey!
[3717.00 --> 3718.00]  How's it going?
[3718.00 --> 3719.00]  Yeah.
[3719.00 --> 3721.00]  Hold on, we got some cool stuff going on on the float plane!
[3721.00 --> 3722.00]  Float plane!
[3722.00 --> 3725.00]  It's gonna be a float plane!
[3725.00 --> 3726.00]  Float plane!
[3726.00 --> 3730.00]  Everyone's asking about the SpaceX launch, it was amazing.
[3730.00 --> 3733.00]  You should just go check it out.
[3733.00 --> 3734.00]  All right.
[3734.00 --> 3740.00]  So this, we actually did a piece of content for like real actual professionals.
[3740.00 --> 3741.00]  Oh.
[3742.00 --> 3743.00]  Interesting.
[3743.00 --> 3746.00]  Modeling and CAD design, which I know is redundant.
[3746.00 --> 3748.00]  Do you really need a Xeon and a Quadro?
[3748.00 --> 3749.00]  That's cool.
[3749.00 --> 3754.00]  We investigated it, lots of benchmarking, lots of testing, lots of work, good piece of content,
[3754.00 --> 3755.00]  make sure you watch it.
[3755.00 --> 3757.00]  Did you like work with someone else on it?
[3757.00 --> 3758.00]  Alex.
[3758.00 --> 3759.00]  Okay.
[3759.00 --> 3760.00]  Don't worry.
[3760.00 --> 3761.00]  Alex did it.
[3761.00 --> 3762.00]  Shut up.
[3762.00 --> 3763.00]  All right.
[3763.00 --> 3765.00]  Gaming at 120Hz on a TV.
[3765.00 --> 3770.00]  So a lot of people don't know this, but there are TVs out there already, ignoring NVIDIA's
[3770.00 --> 3774.00]  BFGDs, that can run at 120Hz with very low input lag.
[3774.00 --> 3778.00]  So we tested out one of them and talked about the experience.
[3778.00 --> 3784.00]  LTT, computer that self-destructs if it's hacked, which is actually not clickbait.
[3784.00 --> 3785.00]  Oh.
[3785.00 --> 3788.00]  It actually self-destructs if you tamper with it through software, physically.
[3788.00 --> 3789.00]  But how would it?
[3789.00 --> 3790.00]  No.
[3790.00 --> 3791.00]  If it's a successful hack, though, it wouldn't know.
[3791.00 --> 3793.00]  By moving it, it's pretty hardcore.
[3793.00 --> 3794.00]  It wouldn't know.
[3794.00 --> 3796.00]  But if it's a successful hack, it would have no idea.
[3796.00 --> 3798.00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3798.00 --> 3799.00]  Okay.
[3799.00 --> 3802.00]  If you fail at hacking it, you don't get another chance.
[3802.00 --> 3803.00]  It's gone.
[3803.00 --> 3804.00]  There you go.
[3804.00 --> 3805.00]  This one's pretty fun.
[3805.00 --> 3807.00]  This is the Mystic Space Warrior PC.
[3807.00 --> 3809.00]  Can't call it Jedi, because...
[3809.00 --> 3813.00]  What?
[3813.00 --> 3814.00]  Mystic Space Warrior, shut up.
[3814.00 --> 3815.00]  No, I got you.
[3815.00 --> 3817.00]  At first I was just like, what?
[3817.00 --> 3818.00]  And...
[3818.00 --> 3820.00]  You should call it Laser Sword Space Warrior.
[3820.00 --> 3830.00]  Gabe N. Jr. here, who's actually Anthony, that handle, has been pushing me for retro content,
[3830.00 --> 3833.00]  to do more retro content for a long time.
[3833.00 --> 3835.00]  So we've got one piece coming up.
[3835.00 --> 3838.00]  This is the SD2 SNES.
[3838.00 --> 3840.00]  So it's exactly what it sounds like.
[3840.00 --> 3843.00]  SD card 2 Super Nintendo adapter.
[3843.00 --> 3846.00]  And we've actually got another one coming that I don't think is up yet,
[3846.00 --> 3848.00]  that is pretty flippin' cool.
[3848.00 --> 3849.00]  So that's...
[3849.00 --> 3850.00]  Is that still under embargo?
[3850.00 --> 3851.00]  I think it's under embargo.
[3851.00 --> 3852.00]  Forget it.
[3852.00 --> 3856.00]  And then finally, this is one of the coolest videos that we've done this year.
[3856.00 --> 3858.00]  Maybe one of the coolest videos we've done ever.
[3858.00 --> 3863.00]  We went and checked out a real nuclear fusion prototype reactor.
[3863.00 --> 3865.00]  That's cool.
[3865.00 --> 3866.00]  Yeah.
[3866.00 --> 3867.00]  So they're in Burnaby, of all places.
[3867.00 --> 3868.00]  Of course.
[3868.00 --> 3869.00]  There's so many crazy things in Burnaby.
[3869.00 --> 3870.00]  Of course they're in Burnaby.
[3870.00 --> 3871.00]  Oh, okay.
[3871.00 --> 3872.00]  Okay.
[3872.00 --> 3875.00]  So yeah, another video we have coming very soon, but that isn't up yet, is on the Super NT
[3875.00 --> 3876.00]  from Analog.
[3876.00 --> 3880.00]  They basically reverse engineered the hardware of the Super Nintendo.
[3880.00 --> 3881.00]  Super sick.
[3881.00 --> 3883.00]  Which is really cool.
[3883.00 --> 3888.00]  So you can run SNES games in hardware on it.
[3888.00 --> 3889.00]  It's not emulation.
[3889.00 --> 3890.00]  Yeah.
[3890.00 --> 3891.00]  So we've got a review coming of that.
[3891.00 --> 3892.00]  Yeah.
[3892.00 --> 3893.00]  Alright, okay, okay.
[3893.00 --> 3894.00]  We're gone for real this time.
[3894.00 --> 3895.00]  B-b-bye!
[3895.00 --> 3896.00]  Bye!
[3896.00 --> 3897.00]  Uh-uh.
[3897.00 --> 3898.00]  I'm sorry.
[3898.00 --> 3899.00]  I'm sorry.
[3899.00 --> 3900.00]  I'm sorry.
[3900.00 --> 3901.00]  Um.
[3901.00 --> 3902.00]  What are we talking about?
[3902.00 --> 3903.00]  People are talking about Twitch subs.
[3903.00 --> 3905.00]  Someone's like, who's this?
[3905.00 --> 3909.00]  Noel Ferran says, they don't care about Twitch subs.
[3909.00 --> 3913.00]  In the Twitch chat.
[3913.00 --> 3915.00]  Lord Sith Linus.
[3915.00 --> 3916.00]  Yes, yes.
[3916.00 --> 3919.40]  no i mean dark dark space warrior
