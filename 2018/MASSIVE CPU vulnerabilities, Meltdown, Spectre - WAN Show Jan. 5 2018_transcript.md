[0.00 --> 3.00]  Welcome to the WAN Show!
[3.00 --> 6.00]  The first WAN Show of 2018 and...
[6.00 --> 8.00]  The last WAN Show!
[8.00 --> 10.00]  The last WAN Show of this week.
[10.00 --> 13.00]  Before CES. There we go, I forgot what was important.
[13.00 --> 15.00]  CES is gonna happen soon!
[15.00 --> 18.00]  Yeah, that's... I'm gonna blame my mind scattering on that.
[18.00 --> 20.00]  So who's all going? Because this is your first year.
[20.00 --> 23.00]  It's my first year. It's gonna be Alex's first year, Alex the Great-ish.
[23.00 --> 24.00]  Yeah.
[24.00 --> 27.00]  It's gonna be Jake's first time away from home.
[27.00 --> 29.00]  Yes! Away from the nest.
[29.00 --> 33.00]  His mom's driving him to the airport, but after that he's a free man.
[33.00 --> 35.00]  In Vegas, 18.
[35.00 --> 37.00]  I'm gonna give her a wink from the parking lot there.
[37.00 --> 38.00]  Oh yeah.
[38.00 --> 39.00]  A knowing smile.
[40.00 --> 42.00]  Oh wow.
[42.00 --> 46.00]  And so, you, Alex, Jake, Max...
[46.00 --> 47.00]  Yeah.
[47.00 --> 50.00]  And then I think that's everyone who hasn't been.
[50.00 --> 52.00]  I'm not sure if Pella was there last year or not.
[52.00 --> 54.00]  He's been around. There's gonna be a pack of us though.
[54.00 --> 55.00]  Hey Brandon!
[55.00 --> 56.00]  You can look out.
[56.00 --> 58.00]  Was Pella at CES last year?
[58.00 --> 59.00]  Yes.
[59.00 --> 60.00]  Yeah, okay.
[60.00 --> 63.00]  So it's all just writers who weren't there last year.
[63.00 --> 64.00]  And Max.
[64.00 --> 65.00]  Whoa!
[65.00 --> 66.00]  And Max.
[66.00 --> 67.00]  Yeah.
[67.00 --> 68.00]  Colton was almost here.
[68.00 --> 69.00]  Alright.
[69.00 --> 70.00]  You're fine.
[70.00 --> 71.00]  So that's what's going on with CES.
[71.00 --> 72.00]  That's gonna be next week.
[72.00 --> 76.00]  Expect a huge torrent of videos to be hitting YouTube and Floatplane.
[76.00 --> 77.00]  It's gonna be insane.
[77.00 --> 78.00]  Tons of stuff coming.
[78.00 --> 79.00]  Excited and stressed.
[79.00 --> 80.00]  You should be.
[80.00 --> 81.00]  Already, yeah.
[81.00 --> 82.00]  It's a pretty insane experience.
[82.00 --> 83.00]  I have performance anxiety.
[83.00 --> 88.00]  On the one hand, I'm so stoked because as a kid I subscribed to Xbox Magazine and they were
[88.00 --> 89.00]  always talking about going to E3.
[89.00 --> 90.00]  Yeah.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  And I was like, oh that's so amazing.
[91.00 --> 92.00]  It's totally different.
[92.00 --> 93.00]  Sure.
[93.00 --> 96.00]  But I never thought that I'd go to any giant conference like that and see all this cutting
[96.00 --> 97.00]  edge stuff face up.
[97.00 --> 98.00]  It's gonna be awesome.
[98.00 --> 101.00]  CES is more insanity.
[101.00 --> 102.00]  In terms of like.
[102.00 --> 103.00]  That suits me.
[103.00 --> 106.00]  The people on the floor, where you need to go.
[106.00 --> 109.00]  So E3 is nicely contained in one building.
[109.00 --> 112.00]  And they're like super way more hardcore.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Or at least they were.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  They've loosened it up a little bit.
[114.00 --> 115.00]  About who could go.
[115.00 --> 118.00]  So there wasn't a ton of people on the floor and it's all in one building.
[118.00 --> 119.00]  This is.
[119.00 --> 123.00]  Well in the earlier days, like in the early 2000s, it was less exclusive.
[123.00 --> 124.00]  Yes.
[124.00 --> 125.00]  And then they tightened it up.
[125.00 --> 126.00]  Yeah.
[126.00 --> 127.00]  I've got a beard longer.
[127.00 --> 128.00]  You have so much more wisdom than I do.
[128.00 --> 129.00]  And our beards are the same length.
[129.00 --> 131.00]  This doesn't make any sense.
[131.00 --> 132.00]  But yeah.
[132.00 --> 133.00]  CES is gonna be insane.
[133.00 --> 136.00]  I'll be at CES with a mustache.
[136.00 --> 137.00]  No wisdom.
[137.00 --> 138.00]  You're taking all that off?
[138.00 --> 139.00]  No, no.
[139.00 --> 140.00]  I won't.
[140.00 --> 141.00]  I was like, I don't know.
[141.00 --> 142.00]  That's just.
[142.00 --> 147.00]  Either way, what we're gonna talk about this week is a lot of Intel stuff.
[147.00 --> 148.00]  A lot of ARM stuff.
[148.00 --> 149.00]  A lot of AMD stuff.
[149.00 --> 156.00]  As you guys know, CPUs right now are in kind of a terrible spot with meltdown and spec
[156.00 --> 157.00]  actor are both going around rampaging things.
[157.00 --> 158.00]  We're all dead.
[158.00 --> 163.00]  We're gonna talk about what different companies are doing to deal with this, how it's being
[163.00 --> 169.00]  dealt with, how it might affect you, how it's affecting other companies, different responses
[169.00 --> 170.00]  that are happening due to it.
[170.00 --> 171.00]  All that kind of stuff.
[171.00 --> 172.00]  We're gonna talk about all that kind of stuff.
[172.00 --> 175.00]  And there's a bunch of other interesting things as well.
[175.00 --> 178.00]  Like some stuff to do with Spotify.
[178.00 --> 182.00]  And Luke's super secret, New Year's resolution.
[182.00 --> 183.00]  Yeah.
[183.00 --> 185.00]  Roll the intro for dramatic effect.
[185.00 --> 186.00]  Whoa.
[186.00 --> 187.00]  Yes.
[187.00 --> 191.00]  I made that last bit up.
[191.00 --> 192.00]  You got a few minutes to think of something.
[192.00 --> 193.00]  I don't know.
[193.00 --> 194.00]  I didn't make it.
[194.00 --> 195.00]  To go to the gym just as much as I can.
[195.00 --> 196.00]  Eat about as much sugar as I usually do.
[196.00 --> 197.00]  Yeah.
[197.00 --> 198.00]  Yay, sponsors.
[198.00 --> 200.00]  Thank you for making this show viable.
[200.00 --> 201.00]  Moving back.
[201.00 --> 202.00]  Okay.
[202.00 --> 203.00]  Let's get into it.
[203.00 --> 216.00]  I'm gonna post an Rs. Technica thread.
[216.00 --> 219.00]  It was... or a post?
[219.00 --> 221.00]  An article?
[221.00 --> 222.00]  Article.
[222.00 --> 223.00]  There we go.
[223.00 --> 224.00]  We'll go with that.
[224.00 --> 225.00]  It's the episode.
[225.00 --> 227.00]  I'm gonna make this episode two.
[227.00 --> 229.00]  I want to make it a few minutes.
[229.00 --> 230.00]  I'll go with theament.
[230.00 --> 231.76]  It's posted by Peter Bright.
[232.28 --> 233.72]  It's a very good article.
[233.86 --> 237.76]  Thank you, Peter Bright, for making a very nice, concise package.
[238.00 --> 239.44]  This is everything that's going on.
[239.48 --> 240.38]  It's way too long.
[240.50 --> 243.72]  Most people aren't going to read it, grab a coffee and a donut to go through it kind of article.
[243.82 --> 244.82]  There's a lot of information.
[245.02 --> 248.52]  This whole story is like an onion with layers.
[248.92 --> 253.56]  So we're going to take you through the entire story of how these vulnerabilities were discovered,
[254.30 --> 257.04]  what the response from the parties involved was,
[257.04 --> 261.62]  and kind of all the insanity that has ensued and is still ensuing today.
[261.86 --> 262.26]  Yes.
[262.42 --> 266.12]  So I'm going to jump slightly forward and explain what they are,
[267.02 --> 270.22]  and then we'll jump back to the start and explain how it was found and all that kind of stuff.
[270.32 --> 270.88]  Does that make sense?
[271.24 --> 271.50]  Okay.
[271.50 --> 272.76]  And jump around a little bit.
[272.84 --> 273.82]  It's going to be a crazy tangent.
[273.82 --> 276.16]  So I'm going to steal some of this from Ars Technica.
[276.34 --> 277.62]  Again, thank you very much, Peter Bright.
[278.60 --> 282.10]  So there's two main vulnerabilities.
[282.46 --> 283.18]  And they're kind of related?
[283.50 --> 284.50]  They are kind of related.
[284.50 --> 287.92]  They source from the same type of area.
[288.10 --> 289.60]  So jumping to the Ars article.
[291.24 --> 294.00]  Modern processors perform speculative execution.
[294.22 --> 295.58]  That's where a lot of this is based on.
[295.84 --> 301.06]  That is where a processor will assume what needs to be done next and do that thing,
[301.48 --> 302.52]  do those calculations.
[303.04 --> 306.56]  And then if it is wrong and that isn't what's happening next, that is fine.
[306.60 --> 307.10]  It doesn't matter.
[307.22 --> 308.76]  It ditches all that code.
[309.06 --> 309.56]  No big deal.
[309.90 --> 311.88]  If it's right, then, hey, it's already done it,
[311.92 --> 313.56]  and it's able to execute that thing faster.
[313.56 --> 315.72]  This is a great thing.
[316.04 --> 317.44]  It makes things run a lot faster.
[317.92 --> 321.66]  It's not a big deal that it's running some code and coming up with some answers
[321.66 --> 325.14]  and then ditching those answers because it's making a lot of other things faster
[325.14 --> 326.32]  when it does guess correctly.
[326.38 --> 327.44]  It's pretty much only upside.
[328.86 --> 329.26]  Yeah.
[329.66 --> 332.92]  This is a property of modern CPUs.
[332.92 --> 336.34]  So that would be a reason why, spoiler alert,
[336.78 --> 342.76]  these vulnerabilities don't really have as much of an impact on much older chips.
[343.14 --> 343.48]  Yeah.
[343.48 --> 347.72]  So Spectre and Meltdown that we're going to be talking about today,
[347.84 --> 353.84]  it perturbs the processor state in detectable ways, which is bad.
[354.24 --> 356.26]  That essentially, when you break that down,
[356.32 --> 359.50]  means that these vulnerabilities can watch,
[360.22 --> 363.44]  even though it doesn't have access to these code paths,
[363.58 --> 365.08]  these speculative execution code paths,
[365.26 --> 369.72]  it can figure out what they're doing, which is bad because it gives them more information.
[369.72 --> 372.82]  And it could result in more things down the line.
[373.02 --> 374.62]  Meltdown and Spectre is what we know of right now.
[375.00 --> 377.32]  So again, to break down what Meltdown and Spectre are,
[377.74 --> 382.74]  Meltdown, it's applicable to every Intel chip made for many years.
[382.88 --> 384.52]  I don't think we know necessarily right now.
[384.62 --> 385.56]  There is a list.
[385.92 --> 386.88]  We should show the list.
[387.02 --> 389.34]  I don't entirely know if the list is...
[389.34 --> 390.06]  You don't believe my list?
[390.20 --> 390.40]  Oh.
[391.80 --> 392.92]  We didn't do screen sharing.
[392.94 --> 394.14]  We have an HDMI right here.
[394.24 --> 398.10]  The classic meme of Wancho, which is it's late.
[398.10 --> 399.38]  Screen sharing is never set up.
[399.38 --> 399.88]  Not prepared.
[400.08 --> 401.02]  And audio doesn't work.
[402.38 --> 403.38]  Yes, except...
[405.00 --> 406.36]  What screen is that?
[408.34 --> 408.82]  What?
[409.40 --> 410.90]  That's not up on either.
[413.48 --> 414.58]  That's awesome.
[415.66 --> 416.42]  Hold on.
[417.68 --> 419.04]  Anyways, there is a list.
[419.22 --> 422.04]  I can post it in the Twitch chat,
[422.18 --> 423.78]  so you guys can check it out yourselves.
[423.94 --> 427.16]  Suffice to say, it's basically every Intel chip for the last 15 years.
[427.36 --> 428.94]  Yeah, kind of a big deal.
[428.94 --> 431.84]  And it's going to affect different chips in different ways,
[431.92 --> 433.88]  which is another interesting part.
[434.30 --> 435.88]  Newer chips have certain standards,
[435.88 --> 441.14]  which will actually help them deal with this a little bit better than certain older chips.
[441.22 --> 443.98]  It also affects different programs differently.
[443.98 --> 447.12]  So certain programs are going to get hit by this really heavily.
[448.02 --> 449.32]  Microsoft has found...
[449.32 --> 450.78]  We'll go into that more later.
[450.88 --> 456.24]  But Microsoft has found that certain antiviruses have been using things in undocumented ways
[456.24 --> 459.36]  that utilize this type of stuff.
[459.56 --> 460.98]  So when they try to turn it off...
[460.98 --> 462.64]  Again, we're going to get into that more later.
[462.64 --> 464.66]  I'm trying to be vague because we'll go more deeply into that later.
[465.00 --> 468.66]  It causes problems for the antivirus programs, which is a nightmare.
[469.40 --> 471.48]  But anyways, it's all a whole mess.
[471.74 --> 471.98]  But Meltdown...
[471.98 --> 474.28]  That was basically a verbal table of contents.
[474.92 --> 475.72]  Thank you.
[475.72 --> 477.72]  Meltdown...
[477.72 --> 478.62]  Chapter one.
[478.72 --> 480.98]  ...applicable to every Intel chip for many years,
[481.10 --> 482.46]  listed in the Twitch chat,
[482.82 --> 487.26]  and will be in the doc if you access the forum.
[487.56 --> 488.82]  So if you're watching this on YouTube,
[489.24 --> 490.90]  or you're listening to this on SoundCloud,
[491.40 --> 493.66]  which a few people do,
[494.00 --> 495.50]  it does actually happen.
[495.84 --> 497.54]  Some people do listen to this on SoundCloud.
[497.90 --> 499.14]  You can go into the description,
[499.64 --> 501.18]  and there will be a forum link.
[501.18 --> 503.04]  If you go to that, that'll show the doc.
[503.12 --> 506.06]  And in the doc, there will be a link with all capital letters
[506.06 --> 508.02]  that says List of Effected Intel CPUs.
[508.50 --> 509.56]  Anyways, moving on.
[509.74 --> 511.08]  Every Intel chip for many years,
[511.26 --> 513.72]  along with certain high-performance ARM designs,
[513.84 --> 515.20]  only high-performance ARM designs,
[515.68 --> 519.18]  this flaw depends on the way that operating systems share memory
[519.18 --> 521.04]  between user programs and the kernel.
[521.34 --> 525.56]  And the solution right now carries some performance penalty.
[525.82 --> 528.12]  In certain cases, really brutal ones.
[528.12 --> 531.26]  I believe the highest reported that I've seen is about 30%.
[531.26 --> 533.34]  Yeah, but I think that's more anonymous.
[533.68 --> 536.08]  I think it's usually, especially if you have a newer CPU,
[536.22 --> 537.20]  it's about 5%.
[537.20 --> 537.84]  Yeah, yeah.
[537.94 --> 539.74]  It's very rarely that bad.
[539.96 --> 542.60]  It's also only certain processes and programs
[542.60 --> 544.02]  that are going to get affected by it.
[544.26 --> 547.58]  And it's also less as impactful if you have newer chips.
[547.88 --> 549.28]  And it's going to depend on what you're doing, too.
[549.30 --> 553.90]  I've heard in gaming, it can result in like three frames per second.
[554.08 --> 554.42]  Yeah.
[554.64 --> 556.76]  But it really is going to depend.
[556.76 --> 565.48]  But the answer to this is to put an end to that sharing of memory
[565.48 --> 567.14]  between user programs and the kernel,
[567.46 --> 569.40]  which is why there's that performance penalty.
[569.86 --> 575.32]  And then Spectre, it's applicable to chips from Intel, AMD, and ARM.
[575.88 --> 577.62]  This is where some of the confusion came in
[577.62 --> 578.72]  that we're going to talk about soon,
[578.88 --> 582.04]  where AMD didn't think they were susceptible to anything,
[582.04 --> 586.00]  and then now it's just Intel's susceptible to more stuff,
[586.16 --> 588.02]  and everyone's susceptible to some things.
[588.04 --> 591.78]  And each company is trying to minimize the optics.
[592.70 --> 595.78]  AMD said this is a near zero chance of affecting us,
[596.32 --> 598.44]  and Intel doesn't want their stock to drop,
[598.52 --> 600.26]  so they're saying, yes, it does affect you.
[600.44 --> 600.72]  Yeah.
[601.48 --> 603.10]  There's a lot of politics involved as well.
[603.10 --> 604.94]  There's a huge amount of politics in this.
[605.04 --> 607.26]  We'll get into that a little bit more in the future.
[608.80 --> 611.26]  Yeah, it even says Intel, AMD, ARM,
[611.36 --> 613.54]  and probably every other processor on the market
[613.54 --> 615.36]  that offers speculative execution,
[615.52 --> 616.76]  which is like all of them.
[618.22 --> 619.74]  It's also more subtle.
[619.90 --> 622.48]  It encompasses a trick testing array bounds
[622.48 --> 624.60]  to read memory within single processes,
[624.60 --> 627.90]  which can be used to attack the integrity
[627.90 --> 629.88]  of virtual machines and sandboxes,
[629.98 --> 631.56]  which is rough.
[631.56 --> 633.14]  That's a big deal for the cloud.
[633.46 --> 633.70]  Yeah.
[634.58 --> 639.16]  And cross-process attacks using processors branch predictors,
[639.20 --> 640.80]  which is the thing that I was mentioning earlier,
[641.10 --> 644.48]  where it can take little bits of resulting information
[644.48 --> 645.68]  to figure out what it was actually doing.
[646.48 --> 648.30]  Fixes for some aspects of Spectre
[648.30 --> 650.14]  appear to have been developed already,
[650.58 --> 652.94]  but protecting against the whole range of fixes
[652.94 --> 654.26]  will require modification
[654.26 --> 657.42]  or at least recompilation of at-risk programs,
[657.42 --> 660.82]  and that is also a very rough part
[660.82 --> 663.66]  because that brings way more players into the space
[663.66 --> 665.56]  because now you're talking about programs too.
[665.94 --> 667.24]  Do you think it's fair to say
[667.24 --> 669.62]  that the only true fix is new chip architecture?
[673.34 --> 673.82]  No.
[677.54 --> 679.04]  One, it depends on what we're talking about.
[679.24 --> 680.78]  Unfortunately, the sketchy one
[680.78 --> 683.48]  that requires the most amount of tinkery level fixing
[683.48 --> 685.74]  for the most amount of people is Spectre,
[685.88 --> 686.80]  which affects everybody.
[687.46 --> 689.92]  Everybody that has speculative processing.
[691.14 --> 693.24]  So that's really annoying.
[693.66 --> 696.54]  But you can, on a single system,
[697.04 --> 698.24]  know that you're okay
[698.24 --> 701.70]  if you go through everything.
[702.12 --> 705.22]  Make sure everything has been modified or recompiled
[705.22 --> 706.84]  that is affected by this.
[707.08 --> 708.86]  Make sure your OS level is happy,
[709.12 --> 709.96]  all that kind of stuff.
[709.96 --> 711.60]  Turn on Windows updates, guys.
[712.48 --> 713.38]  At least.
[714.58 --> 715.10]  Yeah.
[716.46 --> 719.42]  It's kind of a nightmare.
[719.66 --> 722.26]  So how did this first get discovered?
[722.54 --> 723.36]  You want to jump us there?
[724.14 --> 726.08]  I thought I was going to be an interviewer.
[726.20 --> 728.56]  But I can clarify some things because you know.
[728.86 --> 729.20]  Okay.
[729.66 --> 731.04]  So the way this was discovered
[731.04 --> 732.76]  was through Google Project Zero.
[733.42 --> 734.94]  Project Zero is one of those
[734.94 --> 737.02]  little Google subsidiaries
[737.02 --> 739.40]  companies that has a specific task.
[739.64 --> 740.82]  Their task is to find
[740.82 --> 742.78]  what are called zero-day bugs
[742.78 --> 743.60]  or vulnerabilities.
[743.86 --> 744.46]  That's where the zero
[744.46 --> 745.56]  from Project Zero comes from.
[745.76 --> 746.26]  That's right.
[746.38 --> 748.04]  So basically, you're finding a bug
[748.04 --> 749.16]  as soon as you can,
[749.26 --> 749.84]  as fast as you can,
[749.96 --> 751.56]  and fixing it as soon as it's found.
[752.00 --> 753.38]  So the way this works is
[753.38 --> 755.00]  there are bug bounties,
[755.08 --> 757.26]  a certain amount of money put up
[757.26 --> 758.24]  if bugs are found.
[758.46 --> 759.58]  So all these freelancers,
[759.72 --> 760.56]  Joe Schmoes, hackers,
[761.32 --> 762.86]  white hats around the world,
[762.86 --> 765.02]  are actively searching for bugs
[765.02 --> 768.62]  among the suite of software
[768.62 --> 771.82]  and hardware that is on Project Zero's list.
[772.02 --> 773.10]  So a company can say,
[773.22 --> 773.76]  we're on your list.
[773.84 --> 775.20]  We want your freelancers
[775.20 --> 776.90]  to find bugs for us.
[776.90 --> 777.18]  Yeah.
[777.82 --> 779.28]  So a person or team
[779.28 --> 780.38]  It's a really cool program.
[781.26 --> 782.22]  found this vulnerability,
[782.36 --> 783.66]  I believe in the summertime, actually.
[783.94 --> 784.84]  It's been a bit.
[785.04 --> 785.92]  People have been working on this
[785.92 --> 786.58]  for a little while.
[787.00 --> 787.16]  Yeah.
[787.62 --> 789.22]  And they notified Intel at the time.
[789.70 --> 789.96]  Yeah.
[790.38 --> 791.64]  But it's only just become known
[791.64 --> 792.60]  to the public this week.
[792.60 --> 793.70]  One quick thing.
[793.82 --> 795.04]  Someone in the chat was like,
[795.26 --> 797.12]  idiot, this doesn't affect iPhones.
[797.48 --> 798.60]  Apple has already issued,
[799.74 --> 803.00]  Apple has updated both iOS and macOS
[803.00 --> 805.88]  to use dual page table mappings,
[806.16 --> 809.32]  I believe specifically for Spectre.
[809.50 --> 809.68]  Yeah.
[809.98 --> 810.18]  So.
[810.62 --> 811.44]  It does affect it.
[811.46 --> 811.88]  The thing is,
[811.92 --> 814.18]  it's such a low level vulnerability
[814.18 --> 817.44]  that if Apple is going to patch it,
[817.58 --> 818.92]  they're doing it at a higher level.
[818.92 --> 821.14]  So they're only going to be able to defend
[821.14 --> 823.26]  from certain aspects of it.
[823.72 --> 823.94]  Yeah.
[824.14 --> 824.26]  Well,
[824.36 --> 826.50]  and there's some nice stuff.
[826.62 --> 826.80]  Like,
[826.90 --> 828.32]  we're jumping around all over the place.
[828.38 --> 829.82]  I know it's going to be a little bit hard to follow.
[829.82 --> 834.50]  So I would highly recommend checking out the WAN show doc
[834.50 --> 835.46]  on the forum for this,
[835.64 --> 837.70]  reading a few of the different actual articles
[837.70 --> 839.00]  that have been properly posted.
[839.14 --> 840.94]  We're trying to talk live.
[842.24 --> 843.84]  The ARS article is really good,
[844.04 --> 845.38]  but also with something like this,
[845.78 --> 847.32]  you should cross-reference information
[847.32 --> 848.52]  just to make sure you're getting everything good.
[848.52 --> 849.68]  So if this is affecting you
[849.68 --> 850.78]  or you're really interested in this,
[850.86 --> 852.52]  I would definitely recommend diving into it.
[852.80 --> 855.80]  But people like Amazon with S2 instances
[855.80 --> 858.12]  are pushing updates of their own,
[858.20 --> 860.16]  which is like handling everything on their side,
[860.42 --> 861.44]  which is really nice.
[862.18 --> 862.96]  But there's,
[863.12 --> 865.14]  that's not the case in all situations.
[865.14 --> 865.64]  But sorry,
[865.82 --> 866.10]  continue.
[867.10 --> 867.50]  Well,
[867.54 --> 868.00]  you continue.
[868.34 --> 869.12]  So what happened after that?
[869.16 --> 869.64]  They found it.
[869.64 --> 870.30]  Moving after that.
[870.36 --> 870.82]  The universities,
[870.92 --> 872.32]  they made a nice white paper about it.
[872.46 --> 872.70]  Yeah.
[872.86 --> 875.08]  So universities from America,
[875.26 --> 877.30]  I remember it because it's three A countries.
[877.66 --> 878.10]  America,
[878.34 --> 878.68]  Austria,
[878.86 --> 879.40]  and Australia.
[879.64 --> 879.86]  Boom.
[881.10 --> 881.88]  Oh no,
[881.96 --> 882.68]  it did this thing.
[883.48 --> 884.88]  Randomly when we're doing the WAN show,
[885.02 --> 886.72]  I get signed out of my Google account
[886.72 --> 887.72]  and I have to,
[887.78 --> 888.20]  it's okay,
[888.24 --> 889.70]  I don't actually need it this second.
[889.80 --> 891.04]  I'll get signed in while I'm talking.
[891.58 --> 891.84]  Oh,
[891.98 --> 892.54]  last pass.
[892.70 --> 892.92]  Oh,
[893.14 --> 893.96]  this whole thing.
[893.98 --> 894.34]  You're screwed.
[894.34 --> 894.84]  It's so much.
[894.84 --> 896.80]  You're going to need your YubiKey and everything now.
[897.34 --> 898.16]  Hopefully not.
[898.32 --> 899.04]  We'll see though.
[899.84 --> 900.38]  But yeah,
[900.48 --> 901.60]  universities from America,
[901.84 --> 902.26]  Australia,
[902.26 --> 903.40]  and Austria,
[904.04 --> 905.48]  and Google Project Zero,
[905.80 --> 908.14]  and people working at Microsoft,
[908.66 --> 909.76]  and Google,
[910.10 --> 910.64]  and Amazon,
[910.98 --> 912.08]  and all these huge companies
[912.08 --> 914.02]  all came together to try to work on this.
[915.00 --> 917.24]  And they've been working on it actually
[917.24 --> 918.96]  for quite a while.
[920.72 --> 921.34]  There's,
[921.70 --> 923.44]  this is where we get into,
[924.82 --> 926.72]  there's a lot of different information
[926.72 --> 928.92]  and it's a little bit confusing
[928.92 --> 930.48]  what happened next,
[930.48 --> 932.30]  but the public figured out.
[932.72 --> 933.74]  And the public figured out
[933.74 --> 936.22]  not that long ago.
[936.78 --> 940.40]  The main article that really blew up
[940.40 --> 941.32]  in a lot of people's minds
[941.32 --> 942.78]  because it was much more public facing,
[942.90 --> 943.36]  I believe,
[943.48 --> 944.66]  was the Register article,
[945.40 --> 946.28]  register.co.uk,
[946.44 --> 948.54]  which is posted in the WAN doc,
[948.60 --> 949.32]  if you want to check it out,
[949.38 --> 949.88]  on the forum.
[949.88 --> 951.36]  That was,
[951.36 --> 952.32]  as far as I know,
[952.44 --> 953.72]  one of the biggest explosions
[953.72 --> 955.78]  in terms of more people knowing.
[956.26 --> 957.32]  There was talk about it
[957.32 --> 960.38]  on more like programmer-focused back channels.
[960.52 --> 962.74]  This was a big news outlet bringing it on.
[962.96 --> 964.10]  I could be wrong about that.
[964.18 --> 965.18]  It could have been someone else first.
[965.34 --> 966.46]  This is the first one I saw.
[966.50 --> 966.70]  Same.
[966.70 --> 967.66]  And I think it's the first one
[967.66 --> 968.28]  most people saw.
[969.68 --> 971.20]  It got to there,
[971.34 --> 972.98]  as far as I know,
[973.38 --> 976.42]  because a programmer at AMD
[976.42 --> 979.46]  pushed code to the Linux kernel.
[980.10 --> 980.94]  Let's see here.
[981.82 --> 982.16]  Ah.
[983.74 --> 984.26]  Yeah.
[984.34 --> 985.12]  So there was an embargo
[985.12 --> 986.18]  on all this kind of stuff
[986.18 --> 988.18]  through the Google Project Zero platform.
[988.78 --> 989.94]  Not everyone agrees
[989.94 --> 991.20]  with having embargoes
[991.20 --> 992.08]  on these types of things.
[992.20 --> 993.82]  Some people position themselves
[993.82 --> 995.92]  with all information should be open.
[996.28 --> 996.82]  Everyone should know
[996.82 --> 997.84]  everything that's going on.
[999.02 --> 1000.10]  And your opinion on that
[1000.10 --> 1001.26]  is whatever, Zs.
[1001.34 --> 1002.44]  But there was an embargo.
[1003.06 --> 1006.58]  And it wasn't technically broken.
[1006.88 --> 1007.18]  I don't know.
[1007.22 --> 1009.04]  You can frame that however you want.
[1010.62 --> 1010.94]  But...
[1010.94 --> 1012.26]  Yeah.
[1012.34 --> 1012.66]  So it says,
[1012.92 --> 1013.64]  it's true that AMD
[1013.64 --> 1014.78]  didn't actually reveal
[1014.78 --> 1016.12]  the details of the flaw
[1016.12 --> 1017.68]  before the embargo was up.
[1017.98 --> 1019.64]  But one of the company's developers
[1019.64 --> 1021.00]  came very close
[1021.00 --> 1021.64]  and close enough
[1021.64 --> 1023.48]  to infer what was actually going on.
[1024.58 --> 1025.44]  An AMD developer
[1025.44 --> 1026.82]  contributed a Linux patch
[1026.82 --> 1028.38]  that excluded AMD chips
[1028.38 --> 1030.00]  from the meltdown mitigation.
[1030.62 --> 1031.90]  In the note with the patch,
[1031.98 --> 1032.66]  the developer wrote,
[1032.98 --> 1034.54]  the AMD microarchitecture
[1034.54 --> 1036.74]  does not allow memory references,
[1037.00 --> 1038.40]  including speculative references
[1038.40 --> 1040.68]  that access higher privileged data
[1040.68 --> 1041.44]  when running
[1041.44 --> 1042.92]  in a lesser privileged mode
[1042.92 --> 1044.04]  when that access
[1044.04 --> 1045.64]  would result in a page fault.
[1046.02 --> 1047.00]  So with that information,
[1047.44 --> 1048.40]  knowing that people
[1048.40 --> 1050.12]  are writing code
[1050.12 --> 1051.28]  and it's extremely important,
[1051.28 --> 1053.30]  having that
[1053.30 --> 1054.42]  basically is like,
[1054.50 --> 1055.92]  we are not vulnerable to this
[1055.92 --> 1057.00]  and knowing that people
[1057.00 --> 1058.00]  are working on something
[1058.00 --> 1058.62]  very major
[1058.62 --> 1059.34]  and he's like
[1059.34 --> 1060.68]  excluding themselves from it,
[1060.68 --> 1061.52]  you can kind of figure out
[1061.52 --> 1062.20]  what's going on.
[1063.00 --> 1064.22]  But then the guy
[1064.22 --> 1065.28]  kind of got
[1065.28 --> 1066.56]  murked by a,
[1066.74 --> 1067.14]  but wait,
[1067.96 --> 1068.42]  there's another.
[1068.42 --> 1069.12]  There's more.
[1069.54 --> 1069.94]  Yeah.
[1069.94 --> 1071.16]  So there's always two.
[1071.28 --> 1072.78]  This is where the politics part
[1072.78 --> 1073.68]  comes in because,
[1073.86 --> 1074.20]  and okay,
[1075.48 --> 1077.48]  this is where it gets confusing too
[1077.48 --> 1078.96]  because I have also heard
[1078.96 --> 1080.68]  that there was stuff
[1080.68 --> 1082.04]  at Google that was leaked.
[1082.20 --> 1083.82]  There's also been some emails
[1083.82 --> 1084.78]  that have been leaked.
[1085.04 --> 1085.88]  There's been tons
[1085.88 --> 1086.60]  of different stuff.
[1086.70 --> 1087.86]  I'm not entirely sure
[1087.86 --> 1089.78]  which spark was lit first.
[1090.46 --> 1091.56]  This is what I read
[1091.56 --> 1092.84]  in the Ars Technica article.
[1093.08 --> 1094.04]  There's other stuff
[1094.04 --> 1094.52]  that I've read.
[1094.76 --> 1095.34]  Who knows?
[1095.70 --> 1096.12]  Anyway,
[1096.28 --> 1096.92]  it got exposed
[1096.92 --> 1097.56]  to the public
[1097.56 --> 1098.78]  at some point.
[1099.94 --> 1100.82]  And from there,
[1100.88 --> 1101.28]  people started
[1101.28 --> 1102.24]  freaking the hell out.
[1102.70 --> 1104.48]  And that was mostly
[1104.48 --> 1106.12]  based around Meltdown.
[1106.64 --> 1107.58]  That's where we got
[1107.58 --> 1108.42]  most of our information
[1108.42 --> 1109.22]  about Meltdown,
[1109.46 --> 1111.38]  which AMD is essentially,
[1112.18 --> 1112.88]  as of right now,
[1112.94 --> 1113.62]  as far as I know,
[1113.70 --> 1114.38]  as far as I've seen
[1114.38 --> 1115.02]  published everywhere,
[1115.36 --> 1116.34]  they're excluded from that.
[1116.54 --> 1117.32]  They're fine with Meltdown.
[1117.56 --> 1118.08]  And that's why
[1118.08 --> 1119.34]  there's a bunch of confusion
[1119.34 --> 1120.58]  even when you Google this
[1120.58 --> 1122.04]  because there's a timeline here
[1122.04 --> 1123.58]  where the first part
[1123.58 --> 1124.62]  of the media wave
[1124.62 --> 1126.08]  was everyone responding
[1126.08 --> 1126.90]  to Meltdown
[1126.90 --> 1127.56]  and saying like,
[1127.70 --> 1129.12]  you're going to read articles
[1129.12 --> 1130.60]  that say AMD is not affected.
[1130.72 --> 1131.66]  It'll say that in bold.
[1132.60 --> 1133.40]  But it depends
[1133.40 --> 1134.10]  when that was written.
[1134.50 --> 1134.74]  Yeah.
[1134.86 --> 1136.68]  Like the register article,
[1136.94 --> 1137.94]  which exposed
[1137.94 --> 1138.68]  a lot of this stuff
[1138.68 --> 1139.76]  and really started
[1139.76 --> 1140.38]  exploding things
[1140.38 --> 1141.12]  like I was saying earlier,
[1141.54 --> 1142.40]  specifically says
[1142.40 --> 1144.16]  Intel CPU design flaw.
[1145.16 --> 1146.48]  Then there's another one
[1146.48 --> 1148.10]  by the Inquirer
[1148.10 --> 1148.94]  that says,
[1148.94 --> 1150.56]  Intel ARM and AMD
[1150.56 --> 1152.00]  all affected by Meltdown
[1152.00 --> 1153.22]  and Spectre security
[1153.22 --> 1154.78]  bypassing CPU design flaw
[1154.78 --> 1156.14]  in the freaking title.
[1156.48 --> 1157.06]  So who knows?
[1157.14 --> 1157.96]  Because that one says
[1157.96 --> 1158.92]  that AMD is affected
[1158.92 --> 1159.54]  by Meltdown.
[1159.68 --> 1160.98]  But then almost everything else
[1160.98 --> 1161.62]  is saying that AMD
[1161.62 --> 1162.92]  isn't affected by Meltdown.
[1163.42 --> 1164.30]  I'm kind of going
[1164.30 --> 1165.74]  with the isn't side of things.
[1166.06 --> 1166.74]  But then this is where
[1166.74 --> 1167.40]  it gets political
[1167.40 --> 1169.08]  because AMD goes,
[1169.20 --> 1169.72]  ha ha ha,
[1169.88 --> 1170.66]  we're not affected,
[1171.20 --> 1172.16]  everything's fine.
[1172.48 --> 1173.68]  And then Intel releases
[1173.68 --> 1175.02]  super vague,
[1175.52 --> 1177.16]  really confusing details.
[1177.60 --> 1179.52]  Like one of my favorite lines,
[1179.82 --> 1181.50]  it's in the ARS article.
[1181.50 --> 1185.18]  the company's initial statement
[1185.18 --> 1186.46]  produced on Wednesday
[1186.46 --> 1189.58]  says, for example,
[1189.86 --> 1190.72]  these exploits
[1190.72 --> 1192.18]  do not have the potential
[1192.18 --> 1192.80]  to corrupt,
[1193.04 --> 1193.36]  modify,
[1193.52 --> 1194.30]  or delete data.
[1194.94 --> 1195.40]  Um,
[1195.96 --> 1196.68]  which is great
[1196.68 --> 1197.78]  because that is completely
[1197.78 --> 1198.54]  not the point
[1198.54 --> 1199.38]  and no one claimed
[1199.38 --> 1200.78]  that it did any of those things.
[1201.18 --> 1201.88]  That's like,
[1201.92 --> 1203.40]  there's another CNBC article,
[1203.56 --> 1204.88]  someone in the forum linked,
[1205.40 --> 1206.08]  where it's like,
[1206.54 --> 1208.10]  this doesn't affect NVIDIA.
[1208.10 --> 1209.30]  And everyone's like,
[1209.46 --> 1209.70]  yeah!
[1210.78 --> 1211.34]  They're like,
[1211.70 --> 1212.18]  well, duh.
[1212.38 --> 1213.84]  But it's just a relevant title
[1213.84 --> 1214.62]  for all those.
[1215.00 --> 1216.02]  Or AMD graphics.
[1216.24 --> 1217.58]  Like all the non-techie people
[1217.58 --> 1219.18]  who just bought NVIDIA stock
[1219.18 --> 1219.78]  because it was going
[1219.78 --> 1220.68]  gangbusters this year.
[1220.80 --> 1221.00]  Yeah.
[1221.06 --> 1221.32]  They're like,
[1221.34 --> 1221.96]  oh, thank God,
[1222.04 --> 1222.68]  computer stuff.
[1223.20 --> 1223.60]  Jeez,
[1223.92 --> 1224.60]  we're safe.
[1225.64 --> 1226.04]  Yeah,
[1226.12 --> 1227.92]  so it's confusing
[1227.92 --> 1228.78]  for a lot of people.
[1228.90 --> 1229.06]  Again,
[1229.12 --> 1229.74]  I would highly recommend
[1229.74 --> 1230.66]  that you read these articles,
[1230.78 --> 1231.56]  but we'll do our best
[1231.56 --> 1232.42]  to go through stuff.
[1232.54 --> 1233.30]  But anyways,
[1233.54 --> 1234.18]  that's where it started
[1234.18 --> 1234.88]  getting political
[1234.88 --> 1236.48]  because AMD is trying
[1236.48 --> 1237.00]  to sit over here
[1237.00 --> 1237.44]  and be like,
[1237.44 --> 1237.72]  yes,
[1237.76 --> 1238.38]  it's not us.
[1238.76 --> 1239.50]  And then Intel
[1239.50 --> 1240.36]  is responding to that
[1240.36 --> 1241.06]  by being like,
[1241.18 --> 1241.46]  uh,
[1241.56 --> 1242.54]  confusing statements.
[1243.14 --> 1243.44]  And then...
[1244.18 --> 1245.56]  I like that AMD dance you did.
[1245.94 --> 1246.08]  Yeah.
[1246.24 --> 1246.80]  Ta-da!
[1248.50 --> 1249.74]  But then Spectre
[1249.74 --> 1250.60]  comes out of nowhere
[1250.60 --> 1252.60]  and now it's everybody.
[1253.36 --> 1254.18]  Everybody's included.
[1254.58 --> 1255.40]  Everyone who uses
[1255.40 --> 1256.52]  speculative processing.
[1256.98 --> 1258.48]  Not even just ARM,
[1258.62 --> 1258.96]  Intel,
[1259.16 --> 1260.04]  and AMD,
[1260.24 --> 1260.86]  which is all the ones
[1260.86 --> 1262.52]  we largely know about.
[1262.52 --> 1263.20]  But like,
[1263.36 --> 1264.66]  basically every chip maker
[1264.66 --> 1265.96]  that uses speculative processing,
[1266.34 --> 1267.00]  you're screwed.
[1267.00 --> 1268.04]  Lock up your daughters
[1268.04 --> 1269.30]  and shoot your sons.
[1271.62 --> 1273.20]  That was a Grand Theft Auto reference.
[1273.42 --> 1273.54]  Yes.
[1273.74 --> 1273.94]  Yeah.
[1274.72 --> 1275.20]  So...
[1275.20 --> 1275.80]  Do you want to talk about
[1275.80 --> 1276.76]  what...
[1276.76 --> 1279.28]  How affected is the average person here?
[1279.34 --> 1280.40]  What can they do about it?
[1280.52 --> 1281.90]  Because I've heard,
[1282.14 --> 1282.44]  slash,
[1282.54 --> 1283.46]  read that
[1283.46 --> 1284.64]  even though
[1284.64 --> 1285.56]  the vulnerability
[1285.56 --> 1286.88]  does affect all these chips
[1286.88 --> 1287.84]  that we all have,
[1288.60 --> 1289.30]  this isn't something
[1289.30 --> 1289.84]  that you can
[1289.84 --> 1291.12]  really exploit willy-nilly.
[1291.26 --> 1291.84]  Does it take
[1291.84 --> 1292.70]  quite a bit of work
[1292.70 --> 1293.32]  to exploit these vulnerabilities?
[1293.32 --> 1294.28]  As far as I know,
[1294.36 --> 1295.36]  it takes quite a bit of work.
[1295.48 --> 1296.74]  Most random people
[1296.74 --> 1297.82]  are not going to be targets
[1297.82 --> 1298.28]  for this
[1298.28 --> 1299.42]  as far as I know.
[1299.56 --> 1299.82]  Again,
[1299.90 --> 1301.00]  this is really early on.
[1301.00 --> 1302.04]  Especially right now.
[1302.16 --> 1302.90]  And I'm juggling
[1302.90 --> 1303.76]  a lot of different
[1303.76 --> 1304.82]  conflicting information.
[1305.12 --> 1306.08]  But especially right now...
[1306.08 --> 1306.72]  If you were adept
[1306.72 --> 1308.20]  at exploiting this right now,
[1308.26 --> 1308.66]  you're going to go
[1308.66 --> 1310.50]  for the highest value targets.
[1310.50 --> 1311.20]  Juicy targets.
[1311.20 --> 1312.22]  It's not for
[1312.22 --> 1315.76]  Bob Schwarmaz's
[1315.76 --> 1317.64]  Battlefield 4 gaming PC.
[1318.60 --> 1319.54]  I just can't remember that name.
[1319.62 --> 1320.22]  I like it, though.
[1320.54 --> 1321.32]  It's pretty sweet.
[1321.96 --> 1322.88]  I should make that a gamer tag.
[1322.88 --> 1323.68]  He's got a restaurant.
[1324.34 --> 1324.76]  Oh, yeah.
[1325.02 --> 1325.20]  Yeah.
[1325.42 --> 1326.82]  Oh, I just took Schwarmaz.
[1326.82 --> 1327.48]  Yeah, it's Euro, though,
[1327.54 --> 1328.62]  actually, not Schwarmaz.
[1328.86 --> 1329.48]  Oh, nice.
[1329.48 --> 1330.46]  He gets that all the time.
[1330.48 --> 1331.18]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[1331.54 --> 1332.04]  Yeah, anyways.
[1332.22 --> 1332.58]  Yeah, like,
[1332.68 --> 1333.66]  it's very unlikely
[1333.66 --> 1335.88]  that your personal PC
[1335.88 --> 1336.62]  is going to get attacked.
[1336.86 --> 1337.80]  It's very unlikely
[1337.80 --> 1339.66]  to tie back to that dude
[1339.66 --> 1340.58]  calling someone an idiot
[1340.58 --> 1341.30]  in the Twitch chat
[1341.30 --> 1342.18]  that your iPhone
[1342.18 --> 1343.34]  is going to get attacked,
[1343.60 --> 1344.32]  but essentially,
[1344.46 --> 1345.08]  all these processors
[1345.08 --> 1346.56]  are susceptible to Spectre.
[1346.88 --> 1347.70]  There are updates
[1347.70 --> 1348.56]  that are coming.
[1348.78 --> 1349.42]  Certain programs
[1349.42 --> 1350.06]  are going to have to be
[1350.06 --> 1351.32]  recompiled or modified.
[1351.76 --> 1353.14]  Those things are going to happen,
[1353.22 --> 1354.40]  especially for major
[1354.40 --> 1355.60]  mainline programs.
[1356.46 --> 1357.28]  So we can look forward
[1357.28 --> 1358.22]  to a lot of blue screens
[1358.22 --> 1358.96]  at CES.
[1359.88 --> 1360.70]  You look forward
[1360.70 --> 1362.14]  to a lot of updates.
[1363.04 --> 1364.06]  Windows updates,
[1364.26 --> 1365.06]  program updates,
[1365.24 --> 1366.12]  lots of different things
[1366.12 --> 1367.06]  are going to be updating.
[1367.72 --> 1368.78]  This is where we're going
[1368.78 --> 1369.42]  to tie into
[1369.42 --> 1370.52]  what different companies
[1370.52 --> 1371.30]  have done.
[1372.02 --> 1373.20]  ARM has released
[1373.20 --> 1374.38]  a really, really nice
[1374.38 --> 1375.40]  white paper detailing
[1375.40 --> 1376.70]  how it affects their processors
[1376.70 --> 1377.58]  and all this kind of stuff,
[1377.84 --> 1378.44]  which is going to be
[1378.44 --> 1379.04]  uninteresting
[1379.04 --> 1380.56]  for almost everybody
[1380.56 --> 1381.36]  in this audience
[1381.36 --> 1382.22]  because those are,
[1382.86 --> 1383.60]  for the most point,
[1383.70 --> 1384.98]  not consumer-level processors.
[1385.16 --> 1386.10]  And what I mean by that
[1386.10 --> 1388.62]  is not consumer-serviceable processors.
[1388.90 --> 1389.44]  They're things like
[1389.44 --> 1390.04]  in your phone
[1390.04 --> 1391.36]  or in your IoT devices
[1391.36 --> 1392.48]  or all these other kind of things.
[1392.74 --> 1393.74]  I doubt that you're
[1393.74 --> 1396.46]  running a desktop setup
[1396.46 --> 1398.18]  that has an ARM processor.
[1398.18 --> 1398.80]  But you know,
[1399.36 --> 1400.06]  you might be doing
[1400.06 --> 1400.68]  something weird.
[1401.26 --> 1402.04]  It's possible.
[1402.24 --> 1403.22]  You could plug in your phone.
[1403.96 --> 1404.68]  If it's possible,
[1404.76 --> 1405.20]  it exists.
[1405.46 --> 1405.68]  Yeah.
[1405.80 --> 1406.44]  It's out there somewhere.
[1406.44 --> 1407.68]  You could plug in your phone
[1407.68 --> 1408.42]  and use, like,
[1409.16 --> 1409.98]  external keyboards
[1409.98 --> 1410.86]  and do weird stuff.
[1410.96 --> 1411.10]  Yeah.
[1411.44 --> 1411.96]  It's...
[1411.96 --> 1413.54]  I doubt anyone watching
[1413.54 --> 1414.36]  has that setup,
[1414.50 --> 1415.24]  but it is possible.
[1415.76 --> 1416.08]  Anyways.
[1416.62 --> 1417.56]  Are you ready for this aspect?
[1419.42 --> 1421.16]  Oh, let's jump there
[1421.16 --> 1422.36]  in a quick moment.
[1422.82 --> 1423.50]  So, yeah.
[1423.66 --> 1426.26]  Apple is already releasing updates
[1426.26 --> 1428.28]  for iOS, macOS
[1428.28 --> 1429.56]  and dealing with
[1429.56 --> 1430.56]  some other crazy things.
[1430.72 --> 1431.90]  Microsoft is going ham.
[1432.24 --> 1433.10]  The Microsoft section
[1433.10 --> 1433.72]  of this article
[1433.72 --> 1435.12]  is super long.
[1435.54 --> 1437.10]  One thing that I really like
[1437.10 --> 1437.60]  that they did,
[1437.94 --> 1439.72]  Microsoft has already published
[1439.72 --> 1440.84]  a PowerShell script
[1440.84 --> 1441.66]  that describes
[1441.66 --> 1442.96]  the current system protection
[1442.96 --> 1444.60]  against Meltdown and Spectre
[1444.60 --> 1445.68]  on your computer.
[1446.26 --> 1448.10]  So, if you're into PowerShell,
[1448.18 --> 1449.30]  if you're comfortable with that,
[1449.82 --> 1450.92]  check out the ARS article.
[1451.24 --> 1453.30]  It's linked in the forum link
[1453.30 --> 1453.84]  in the description
[1453.84 --> 1454.98]  if you're watching this on archive.
[1455.20 --> 1455.58]  If not,
[1455.64 --> 1456.30]  I've already posted it
[1456.30 --> 1456.82]  in Twitch chat.
[1457.14 --> 1457.66]  There you go.
[1458.92 --> 1459.80]  And you can check out
[1459.80 --> 1460.32]  what's going on
[1460.32 --> 1461.08]  on your own system.
[1461.46 --> 1462.46]  They're releasing updates
[1462.46 --> 1463.44]  for Edge,
[1463.72 --> 1464.54]  Internet Explorer,
[1465.44 --> 1466.94]  Windows itself.
[1467.98 --> 1469.54]  Mozilla is trying to copy
[1469.54 --> 1470.92]  some of their...
[1470.92 --> 1471.20]  Mozilla.
[1471.46 --> 1471.86]  Mozilla.
[1472.08 --> 1472.40]  Mozilla.
[1472.84 --> 1473.16]  Mozilla, whatever.
[1473.76 --> 1474.66]  They're trying to copy
[1474.66 --> 1475.38]  some of their approaches
[1475.38 --> 1476.10]  to different things.
[1476.42 --> 1477.92]  There's tons of stuff going on.
[1477.98 --> 1480.00]  Microsoft has already updated
[1480.00 --> 1482.62]  its Azure cloud computing platform,
[1482.78 --> 1483.60]  which is awesome.
[1483.70 --> 1484.86]  I would expect that Google
[1484.86 --> 1485.66]  was updated before
[1485.66 --> 1486.48]  we even heard about this.
[1487.42 --> 1488.28]  Oh, they've been on top
[1488.28 --> 1489.40]  of this for a long time.
[1489.54 --> 1489.72]  Yeah.
[1490.38 --> 1492.88]  Amazon has already started
[1492.88 --> 1493.68]  rolling out patches
[1493.68 --> 1495.38]  for EC2
[1495.38 --> 1496.60]  in terms of Meltdown.
[1496.60 --> 1496.64]  Meltdown.
[1498.14 --> 1499.18]  Again, Spectre is going
[1499.18 --> 1499.58]  to be weird
[1499.58 --> 1500.36]  for all this kind of stuff.
[1500.44 --> 1501.08]  I'm mostly talking
[1501.08 --> 1501.66]  about Meltdown.
[1502.58 --> 1504.16]  Google's two consumer-facing
[1504.16 --> 1505.00]  operating systems,
[1505.16 --> 1506.22]  Android and Chrome OS,
[1506.50 --> 1507.90]  both depend on Linux kernels,
[1508.06 --> 1508.90]  and that's already been
[1508.90 --> 1509.58]  being worked on,
[1509.62 --> 1510.34]  as I mentioned earlier,
[1510.44 --> 1511.38]  the AMD guy
[1511.38 --> 1512.32]  working on Linux kernels.
[1513.98 --> 1516.44]  But most Android hardware
[1516.44 --> 1517.60]  and most Android
[1517.60 --> 1518.80]  is a weird thing
[1518.80 --> 1519.48]  to think about
[1519.48 --> 1521.84]  because there's a lot
[1521.84 --> 1522.48]  of really low-end
[1522.48 --> 1523.10]  Android devices
[1523.10 --> 1523.52]  that most people
[1523.52 --> 1524.04]  don't think about,
[1524.04 --> 1526.46]  but isn't susceptible
[1526.46 --> 1528.38]  to Meltdown yet,
[1529.06 --> 1530.00]  but that's going
[1530.00 --> 1531.20]  to change probably.
[1531.84 --> 1533.30]  Anyways, right now,
[1533.40 --> 1534.72]  it's a huge mess.
[1535.04 --> 1535.86]  Everything's a mess.
[1535.98 --> 1536.96]  It's mostly a mess
[1536.96 --> 1538.72]  because it was leaked,
[1539.36 --> 1540.46]  and when it was leaked,
[1540.58 --> 1541.70]  everyone had to scramble
[1541.70 --> 1543.62]  super hard to solve it
[1543.62 --> 1544.38]  instead of trying
[1544.38 --> 1546.02]  to take their time
[1546.02 --> 1547.08]  and be very coordinated
[1547.08 --> 1547.76]  about everything
[1547.76 --> 1548.80]  and very behind the scenes,
[1548.90 --> 1549.56]  and then one day
[1549.56 --> 1550.56]  you just get a Windows update
[1550.56 --> 1551.06]  and you don't even know
[1551.06 --> 1551.96]  anything was ever wrong.
[1551.96 --> 1553.90]  No, instead of that,
[1553.96 --> 1554.80]  everyone's freaking
[1554.80 --> 1555.28]  the hell out
[1555.28 --> 1555.86]  and trying to solve
[1555.86 --> 1556.64]  all of this at once.
[1557.64 --> 1559.10]  And speaking of how
[1559.10 --> 1560.50]  this was very behind doors
[1560.50 --> 1561.16]  for a while,
[1562.10 --> 1564.00]  Intel CEO sold,
[1564.10 --> 1564.42]  what is it,
[1564.48 --> 1566.02]  like 49 or...
[1566.02 --> 1566.76]  $24 million.
[1566.76 --> 1568.90]  $24 million worth of stock.
[1569.40 --> 1569.76]  Right.
[1569.92 --> 1571.06]  So he knew about this.
[1571.48 --> 1572.96]  Google told Intel
[1572.96 --> 1574.06]  about this in the summer.
[1574.80 --> 1576.70]  So the CEO knew
[1576.70 --> 1578.54]  that they were going
[1578.54 --> 1579.20]  to have a fiasco
[1579.20 --> 1579.78]  once the public
[1579.78 --> 1580.68]  found out about this.
[1580.68 --> 1581.96]  He knew the gravity
[1581.96 --> 1582.62]  of the situation,
[1583.10 --> 1584.22]  and then before
[1584.22 --> 1585.66]  this became public,
[1585.82 --> 1587.52]  he sold $24 million worth
[1587.52 --> 1589.28]  of his stock in the company,
[1589.42 --> 1590.42]  which was, I think,
[1590.44 --> 1591.52]  a majority of his stock.
[1592.48 --> 1594.28]  So that doesn't look very good.
[1594.46 --> 1594.82]  No.
[1596.72 --> 1598.98]  But I think this is actually
[1598.98 --> 1599.66]  kind of click-baity
[1599.66 --> 1602.44]  because Intel says
[1602.44 --> 1603.16]  that the stock sale
[1603.16 --> 1603.90]  was unrelated
[1603.90 --> 1604.82]  to the vulnerability
[1604.82 --> 1605.86]  and came as part
[1605.86 --> 1607.90]  of a planned divestiture program.
[1607.90 --> 1609.18]  And those things
[1609.18 --> 1610.12]  are things.
[1610.22 --> 1610.80]  They exist.
[1611.64 --> 1612.48]  The other thing is
[1612.48 --> 1613.30]  Intel's stock price
[1613.30 --> 1613.94]  has only fallen
[1613.94 --> 1615.40]  about $2
[1615.40 --> 1617.90]  since this fiasco
[1617.90 --> 1618.86]  kind of hit the public.
[1619.18 --> 1620.92]  So it's not like it tanked,
[1620.96 --> 1621.62]  and this is like
[1621.62 --> 1622.84]  a huge insider trading thing.
[1623.34 --> 1623.78]  Granted,
[1624.06 --> 1624.28]  $2,
[1624.74 --> 1625.52]  like with the number
[1625.52 --> 1626.84]  of shares outstanding,
[1627.02 --> 1627.72]  it's still like
[1627.72 --> 1628.98]  millions of dollars
[1628.98 --> 1630.22]  coming and going,
[1630.36 --> 1631.12]  or mostly going,
[1631.18 --> 1632.10]  from Intel stock right now.
[1632.10 --> 1633.82]  So it is huge,
[1633.98 --> 1635.50]  but I think this is
[1635.50 --> 1636.16]  a little click-baity.
[1636.90 --> 1638.60]  It really depends.
[1639.10 --> 1640.26]  I'm sure there's going
[1640.26 --> 1641.22]  to be legal oversight
[1641.22 --> 1641.72]  into this
[1641.72 --> 1642.44]  because, like,
[1643.30 --> 1643.88]  man,
[1644.06 --> 1647.46]  if that was planned
[1647.46 --> 1649.98]  without insider trading
[1649.98 --> 1650.72]  and this was just
[1650.72 --> 1652.14]  routine whatever,
[1652.64 --> 1653.72]  the timing on that,
[1654.12 --> 1655.04]  like,
[1655.14 --> 1656.06]  you couldn't be worse
[1656.06 --> 1656.72]  in the last
[1656.72 --> 1657.80]  huge amount of years.
[1658.06 --> 1659.24]  It could not be
[1659.24 --> 1659.74]  worse timing.
[1660.08 --> 1660.52]  It could be
[1660.52 --> 1661.86]  an unfortunate coincidence.
[1661.86 --> 1663.16]  I think people claiming
[1663.16 --> 1664.10]  that it's insider
[1664.10 --> 1666.50]  are,
[1667.90 --> 1668.84]  you can't really
[1668.84 --> 1669.80]  hammer on them too hard
[1669.80 --> 1670.76]  because there's
[1670.76 --> 1671.74]  a lot of things,
[1671.88 --> 1672.70]  a lot of red lights
[1672.70 --> 1673.34]  going off
[1673.34 --> 1674.48]  in terms of timing,
[1674.88 --> 1675.88]  in terms of how much
[1675.88 --> 1676.38]  it was.
[1676.58 --> 1677.78]  $24 million is quite
[1677.78 --> 1678.22]  a bit of money.
[1678.48 --> 1678.94]  I also read,
[1679.12 --> 1679.80]  this is why this is
[1679.80 --> 1680.24]  so confusing.
[1680.50 --> 1681.10]  I read a number
[1681.10 --> 1681.92]  that was over 40.
[1682.72 --> 1683.06]  Okay.
[1683.42 --> 1683.90]  But, like,
[1683.92 --> 1684.74]  I'm not even saying
[1684.74 --> 1685.44]  it's right
[1685.44 --> 1686.72]  because I just read that,
[1686.82 --> 1686.92]  like...
[1686.92 --> 1687.56]  Well, actually,
[1687.82 --> 1688.90]  if this program,
[1689.18 --> 1689.98]  it could be
[1689.98 --> 1690.74]  multiple phases.
[1691.04 --> 1691.16]  That's fair.
[1691.16 --> 1691.88]  So that's the number
[1691.88 --> 1692.40]  that went out
[1692.40 --> 1693.38]  recently in December.
[1693.52 --> 1694.12]  So it could be
[1694.12 --> 1694.78]  over 40,
[1694.90 --> 1695.12]  like,
[1695.20 --> 1695.64]  since summer,
[1695.72 --> 1696.28]  since he's known,
[1696.36 --> 1696.54]  maybe.
[1696.66 --> 1696.90]  Sure.
[1697.06 --> 1697.24]  Yeah.
[1697.24 --> 1697.84]  I don't know.
[1700.00 --> 1700.36]  Yeah.
[1700.72 --> 1701.56]  It's a mess,
[1701.92 --> 1703.90]  but potentially
[1703.90 --> 1704.94]  looking into
[1704.94 --> 1706.64]  his legal
[1706.64 --> 1707.22]  ramifications
[1707.22 --> 1708.10]  for what that
[1708.10 --> 1708.74]  might potentially
[1708.74 --> 1709.30]  end up being
[1709.30 --> 1709.68]  in terms of
[1709.68 --> 1710.22]  insider trading
[1710.22 --> 1710.52]  or not,
[1710.76 --> 1711.30]  and I'm sure
[1711.30 --> 1712.68]  if it was planned,
[1712.82 --> 1713.44]  he has tons
[1713.44 --> 1714.00]  of documentation
[1714.00 --> 1714.64]  for it,
[1714.70 --> 1715.38]  and if it goes
[1715.38 --> 1716.34]  back before this
[1716.34 --> 1717.02]  bug was released
[1717.02 --> 1717.30]  to them,
[1717.46 --> 1718.02]  he's going to be
[1718.02 --> 1718.30]  fine.
[1718.30 --> 1720.36]  If it doesn't,
[1720.42 --> 1721.54]  that's going to
[1721.54 --> 1722.96]  be a little sketch.
[1722.98 --> 1723.56]  But if it was planned
[1723.56 --> 1724.38]  and it is fine,
[1724.80 --> 1725.18]  you're probably
[1725.18 --> 1725.70]  not going to hear
[1725.70 --> 1726.04]  about it
[1726.04 --> 1726.48]  because no one's
[1726.48 --> 1726.80]  going to click
[1726.80 --> 1727.44]  on that article.
[1727.56 --> 1727.76]  Yeah.
[1727.92 --> 1728.22]  It's just,
[1728.30 --> 1728.66]  it's going to be
[1728.66 --> 1728.98]  boring.
[1729.18 --> 1729.80]  It's not a story.
[1729.86 --> 1730.52]  It'll be too boring
[1730.52 --> 1730.98]  to bring up
[1730.98 --> 1731.56]  on WAN Show.
[1731.82 --> 1732.22]  You know what's
[1732.22 --> 1732.74]  not boring?
[1733.54 --> 1734.68]  Intel getting sued
[1734.68 --> 1735.68]  over this vulnerability.
[1735.94 --> 1736.46]  Super hard.
[1736.72 --> 1736.96]  Yeah.
[1737.42 --> 1738.04]  There are multiple
[1738.04 --> 1738.66]  lawsuits.
[1739.28 --> 1739.90]  Hold on one quick
[1739.90 --> 1740.78]  second before we
[1740.78 --> 1741.18]  go forward.
[1741.18 --> 1742.36]  This article was
[1742.36 --> 1743.68]  posted by SC2
[1743.68 --> 1744.48]  Mitch on the
[1744.48 --> 1744.78]  forum.
[1745.20 --> 1745.92]  The previous one
[1745.92 --> 1747.24]  was found by
[1747.24 --> 1747.54]  James.
[1748.46 --> 1749.78]  And the big
[1749.78 --> 1751.00]  whole entire
[1751.00 --> 1751.46]  thread,
[1751.64 --> 1752.30]  the source that
[1752.30 --> 1752.82]  we have for that
[1752.82 --> 1753.56]  is Doctor Who
[1753.56 --> 1755.10]  1975 on the
[1755.10 --> 1755.32]  forum.
[1755.46 --> 1755.96]  He's getting the
[1755.96 --> 1756.12]  credit,
[1756.22 --> 1756.64]  but there actually
[1756.64 --> 1757.32]  are like six
[1757.32 --> 1757.44]  different threads.
[1757.44 --> 1758.10]  I'm sure there's
[1758.10 --> 1758.46]  a lot,
[1758.64 --> 1759.08]  and I'm sure
[1759.08 --> 1759.52]  there's going to
[1759.52 --> 1760.14]  continue to be
[1760.14 --> 1760.32]  more.
[1760.42 --> 1760.84]  Thank you to
[1760.84 --> 1761.50]  everybody who's
[1761.50 --> 1761.92]  been posting
[1761.92 --> 1762.64]  about this stuff.
[1762.94 --> 1763.38]  And that's not
[1763.38 --> 1763.74]  to say they're
[1763.74 --> 1764.36]  duplicate threads.
[1764.54 --> 1765.02]  There's just so
[1765.02 --> 1765.88]  many facets of it.
[1765.88 --> 1767.10]  Yeah, and there's
[1767.10 --> 1768.50]  conflicting ones,
[1768.56 --> 1769.08]  and there's ones
[1769.08 --> 1770.22]  that grow on other
[1770.22 --> 1770.44]  ones,
[1770.44 --> 1771.16]  and it's a
[1771.16 --> 1771.40]  nightmare.
[1771.58 --> 1772.24]  Our forum is a
[1772.24 --> 1773.10]  happening place.
[1773.20 --> 1773.66]  If you don't go
[1773.66 --> 1774.14]  there, you should.
[1774.30 --> 1774.50]  Yeah.
[1774.82 --> 1775.34]  It's cute.
[1775.60 --> 1775.74]  Yeah.
[1777.18 --> 1777.68]  The people who
[1777.68 --> 1778.50]  are suing Intel,
[1778.68 --> 1779.20]  do you think,
[1779.72 --> 1780.28]  so here's the
[1780.28 --> 1780.94]  grounds of at
[1780.94 --> 1781.38]  least one of
[1781.38 --> 1781.52]  them.
[1781.76 --> 1782.04]  Okay.
[1782.30 --> 1782.88]  The lawsuit,
[1783.02 --> 1783.50]  this lawsuit
[1783.50 --> 1783.88]  in particular,
[1784.02 --> 1784.40]  I think it was
[1784.40 --> 1785.24]  maybe the first
[1785.24 --> 1785.40]  one,
[1785.48 --> 1786.12]  Garcia v.
[1786.24 --> 1786.96]  Intel Corporation
[1786.96 --> 1787.50]  filed on
[1787.50 --> 1787.80]  Wednesday,
[1787.94 --> 1788.64]  January 3rd.
[1789.68 --> 1790.32]  The suit's
[1790.32 --> 1790.78]  plaintiffs
[1790.78 --> 1792.34]  allege that the
[1792.34 --> 1793.08]  computer chips
[1793.08 --> 1793.80]  containing the
[1793.80 --> 1794.92]  fatal security
[1794.92 --> 1795.54]  flaw,
[1795.70 --> 1796.02]  well there's a
[1796.02 --> 1796.46]  lot of F's
[1796.46 --> 1796.62]  here,
[1797.02 --> 1797.68]  they violate
[1797.68 --> 1798.62]  California and
[1798.62 --> 1799.38]  Tennessee law
[1799.38 --> 1799.90]  specifically,
[1799.90 --> 1801.00]  the plaintiff's
[1801.00 --> 1801.54]  bring claims
[1801.54 --> 1802.34]  for breach of
[1802.34 --> 1802.98]  warranty and
[1802.98 --> 1803.78]  violations of
[1803.78 --> 1804.80]  consumer protection
[1804.80 --> 1805.80]  statutes,
[1805.86 --> 1806.34]  alleging that
[1806.34 --> 1807.18]  Intel's selling
[1807.18 --> 1808.10]  of computer chips
[1808.10 --> 1808.92]  with this fatal
[1808.92 --> 1809.66]  security flaw
[1809.66 --> 1810.96]  misled consumers
[1810.96 --> 1811.44]  about the
[1811.44 --> 1812.14]  performance and
[1812.14 --> 1813.36]  reliability of
[1813.36 --> 1813.84]  the computers
[1813.84 --> 1814.78]  operating with
[1814.78 --> 1815.52]  this hardware.
[1815.52 --> 1819.06]  my first thought,
[1819.46 --> 1820.22]  like they have a
[1820.22 --> 1820.90]  quote here saying
[1820.90 --> 1821.38]  that they look
[1821.38 --> 1821.86]  forward to holding
[1821.86 --> 1822.64]  Intel responsible
[1822.64 --> 1823.26]  for exposing
[1823.26 --> 1823.84]  millions of
[1823.84 --> 1824.44]  Americans to
[1824.44 --> 1825.36]  unnecessary data
[1825.36 --> 1826.42]  security risks.
[1829.06 --> 1829.80]  That sounds
[1829.80 --> 1830.14]  noble,
[1830.28 --> 1830.70]  it's like yeah,
[1831.34 --> 1831.80]  stick them,
[1831.88 --> 1832.20]  rake them over
[1832.20 --> 1832.58]  the coals,
[1832.68 --> 1833.06]  like someone's
[1833.06 --> 1833.40]  fighting a good
[1833.40 --> 1833.88]  fight for us.
[1833.98 --> 1834.60]  But my first
[1834.60 --> 1835.08]  thought actually
[1835.08 --> 1835.52]  when I read
[1835.52 --> 1836.06]  this was like,
[1836.88 --> 1837.44]  I think these
[1837.44 --> 1838.12]  people might be
[1838.12 --> 1838.54]  those like
[1838.54 --> 1840.16]  professional sewers.
[1840.16 --> 1840.76]  Yeah,
[1840.86 --> 1841.84]  because there's
[1841.84 --> 1842.46]  a very fast
[1842.46 --> 1842.54]  reaction.
[1842.54 --> 1843.56]  I can see you
[1843.56 --> 1843.72]  for this.
[1843.92 --> 1844.36]  There's also
[1844.36 --> 1846.44]  constantly security
[1846.44 --> 1847.24]  issues with this
[1847.24 --> 1847.92]  type of stuff.
[1848.38 --> 1849.16]  It's just usually
[1849.16 --> 1849.68]  handled,
[1850.22 --> 1851.68]  it's usually much
[1851.68 --> 1853.32]  smaller and it's
[1853.32 --> 1853.90]  usually handled
[1853.90 --> 1854.70]  much more quietly.
[1856.20 --> 1857.40]  Like if you
[1857.40 --> 1858.22]  could sue
[1858.22 --> 1859.50]  Microsoft for
[1859.50 --> 1860.18]  having a security
[1860.18 --> 1861.58]  vulnerability in
[1861.58 --> 1861.94]  Windows,
[1862.52 --> 1863.12]  Microsoft would
[1863.12 --> 1863.74]  be gone.
[1864.28 --> 1864.60]  It's just,
[1864.88 --> 1865.36]  it's obviously
[1865.36 --> 1865.94]  because of the
[1865.94 --> 1866.18]  scale.
[1866.54 --> 1867.36]  The scale is why
[1867.36 --> 1867.90]  this is a big
[1867.90 --> 1869.00]  headline and a
[1869.00 --> 1869.40]  big deal.
[1869.40 --> 1869.82]  The scale is
[1869.82 --> 1870.02]  true.
[1870.16 --> 1870.24]  It's much
[1870.24 --> 1870.82]  and doable.
[1871.62 --> 1871.78]  Yeah.
[1873.52 --> 1874.30]  Someone said
[1874.30 --> 1874.66]  it's usually
[1874.66 --> 1875.08]  handled by the
[1875.08 --> 1875.32]  NSA.
[1875.66 --> 1876.16]  I have no
[1876.16 --> 1876.76]  freaking idea.
[1877.20 --> 1877.86]  Someone said
[1877.86 --> 1878.40]  in the chat
[1878.40 --> 1879.58]  he sold them
[1879.58 --> 1880.50]  shortly before
[1880.50 --> 1881.64]  IME vulnerabilities
[1881.64 --> 1882.46]  became public
[1882.46 --> 1883.12]  in November.
[1884.20 --> 1884.64]  Yeah,
[1884.74 --> 1885.24]  that's not what
[1885.24 --> 1885.66]  we were talking
[1885.66 --> 1886.00]  about though.
[1886.10 --> 1886.56]  If it was
[1886.56 --> 1888.64]  planned far
[1888.64 --> 1889.12]  beforehand.
[1889.72 --> 1891.04]  If he comes
[1891.04 --> 1891.64]  in one day
[1891.64 --> 1892.48]  and board of
[1892.48 --> 1893.24]  director guys
[1893.24 --> 1894.96]  or his financial
[1894.96 --> 1895.60]  advisors or
[1895.60 --> 1896.08]  whatever the heck,
[1896.16 --> 1896.60]  I don't know,
[1896.70 --> 1897.14]  I'm not into
[1897.14 --> 1897.60]  this kind of
[1897.60 --> 1897.80]  money,
[1898.20 --> 1898.60]  are like,
[1898.72 --> 1898.92]  hey,
[1898.92 --> 1899.48]  we should
[1899.48 --> 1900.08]  downscale
[1900.08 --> 1900.64]  our stock,
[1900.74 --> 1901.32]  whatever that
[1901.32 --> 1901.76]  thing that you
[1901.76 --> 1901.96]  said.
[1902.90 --> 1903.54]  It's not going
[1903.54 --> 1903.94]  to happen the
[1903.94 --> 1904.36]  next day.
[1904.88 --> 1905.28]  It would be
[1905.28 --> 1905.90]  planned on paper
[1905.90 --> 1906.52]  for a while.
[1907.26 --> 1908.00]  He's moving a
[1908.00 --> 1908.40]  huge amount of
[1908.40 --> 1908.66]  stock.
[1908.72 --> 1908.96]  It's going to
[1908.96 --> 1909.56]  happen over time.
[1911.72 --> 1911.88]  Yeah.
[1912.28 --> 1912.68]  Anyways.
[1913.42 --> 1914.12]  That's about it
[1914.12 --> 1914.52]  for that.
[1915.10 --> 1915.92]  We did it.
[1916.46 --> 1917.42]  I hope we did it.
[1918.26 --> 1918.66]  Again,
[1918.94 --> 1920.32]  there's a huge
[1920.32 --> 1920.66]  amount of
[1920.66 --> 1921.10]  information.
[1921.10 --> 1922.98]  If we actually
[1922.98 --> 1923.44]  wanted to go
[1923.44 --> 1923.88]  over every
[1923.88 --> 1924.28]  single little
[1924.28 --> 1924.76]  tiny bit of
[1924.76 --> 1924.86]  it,
[1924.94 --> 1925.06]  it would
[1925.06 --> 1925.38]  take us
[1925.38 --> 1926.22]  the entire
[1926.22 --> 1926.96]  show and
[1926.96 --> 1927.20]  more.
[1927.64 --> 1928.30]  If you do
[1928.30 --> 1928.68]  want to know
[1928.68 --> 1929.34]  more and if
[1929.34 --> 1929.72]  you're into
[1929.72 --> 1931.06]  computers and
[1931.06 --> 1931.38]  hardware,
[1931.52 --> 1932.12]  this is super
[1932.12 --> 1932.50]  interesting.
[1932.86 --> 1933.28]  I would highly
[1933.28 --> 1933.86]  recommend you
[1933.86 --> 1934.36]  read more,
[1934.66 --> 1935.02]  come up with
[1935.02 --> 1935.28]  your own
[1935.28 --> 1935.88]  opinions about
[1935.88 --> 1936.00]  it,
[1936.16 --> 1936.56]  all that
[1936.56 --> 1936.84]  kind of
[1936.84 --> 1937.16]  stuff.
[1938.40 --> 1938.94]  Check out
[1938.94 --> 1939.30]  the links
[1939.30 --> 1939.78]  that will be
[1939.78 --> 1940.10]  in the
[1940.10 --> 1940.60]  forum
[1940.60 --> 1943.30]  doc thing
[1943.30 --> 1943.66]  that I'll be
[1943.66 --> 1944.00]  posting,
[1944.12 --> 1944.32]  that will be
[1944.32 --> 1944.46]  in the
[1944.46 --> 1944.94]  description on
[1944.94 --> 1945.30]  YouTube.
[1945.30 --> 1949.58]  SoundCloud
[1949.58 --> 1951.08]  and there
[1951.08 --> 1951.44]  we go.
[1951.60 --> 1952.04]  That's it.
[1952.18 --> 1952.56]  That's the
[1952.56 --> 1953.04]  giant,
[1953.50 --> 1954.26]  not just
[1954.26 --> 1954.72]  Intel,
[1954.86 --> 1955.18]  definitely
[1955.18 --> 1955.70]  everybody,
[1955.92 --> 1956.42]  but mostly
[1956.42 --> 1957.18]  Intel and
[1957.18 --> 1957.58]  people are
[1957.58 --> 1958.74]  trying to
[1958.74 --> 1959.74]  obfuscate
[1959.74 --> 1960.72]  information and
[1960.72 --> 1961.32]  some information
[1961.32 --> 1961.88]  is out there
[1961.88 --> 1962.36]  and crazy
[1962.36 --> 1963.18]  stuff and no
[1963.18 --> 1963.98]  official information
[1963.98 --> 1964.90]  completely entirely
[1964.90 --> 1965.20]  yet.
[1965.30 --> 1965.68]  Put your head
[1965.68 --> 1966.06]  in the sand.
[1966.36 --> 1966.92]  What can you do
[1966.92 --> 1967.46]  about it really?
[1967.94 --> 1968.34]  It's probably
[1968.34 --> 1968.74]  not going to
[1968.74 --> 1969.16]  affect you.
[1969.62 --> 1970.36]  Update Windows,
[1970.98 --> 1971.48]  live your life.
[1971.92 --> 1972.06]  Yeah.
[1972.42 --> 1973.06]  Am I right?
[1973.70 --> 1974.18]  For the most
[1974.18 --> 1974.84]  part, yeah.
[1975.30 --> 1975.92]  There is a
[1975.92 --> 1976.40]  loud minority
[1976.40 --> 1976.80]  who's going,
[1976.98 --> 1977.48]  go, you're
[1977.48 --> 1977.92]  not right.
[1978.16 --> 1978.76]  You're not
[1978.76 --> 1979.08]  right.
[1979.20 --> 1979.68]  It's insane.
[1980.18 --> 1980.94]  It's definitely
[1980.94 --> 1981.52]  affecting some
[1981.52 --> 1981.78]  people.
[1981.92 --> 1982.40]  It's affecting
[1982.40 --> 1984.54]  float plane and
[1984.54 --> 1985.98]  it's going to
[1985.98 --> 1986.96]  affect other
[1986.96 --> 1987.98]  kind of
[1987.98 --> 1988.34]  businesses.
[1989.06 --> 1989.72]  As you've
[1989.72 --> 1990.36]  seen, Google
[1990.36 --> 1990.92]  and Amazon
[1990.92 --> 1991.42]  and Microsoft
[1991.42 --> 1991.92]  are all
[1991.92 --> 1992.90]  tweaking out
[1992.90 --> 1993.34]  right now.
[1994.48 --> 1994.92]  Yeah.
[1995.22 --> 1995.60]  Anyways.
[1995.96 --> 1996.64]  And now, a
[1996.64 --> 1997.08]  word from our
[1997.08 --> 1997.46]  sponsors.
[1997.62 --> 1997.96]  Yeah.
[1999.08 --> 1999.38]  Give me a
[1999.38 --> 1999.50]  second.
[1999.68 --> 2000.96]  Stress books.
[2001.62 --> 2002.28]  All right.
[2002.68 --> 2003.18]  Why is there
[2003.18 --> 2003.86]  no lower third?
[2005.30 --> 2009.18]  All right.
[2009.26 --> 2009.70]  Well, there just
[2009.70 --> 2010.22]  isn't one.
[2010.30 --> 2010.92]  How's it going?
[2011.92 --> 2012.80]  Fresh books is the
[2012.80 --> 2013.46]  small business
[2013.46 --> 2014.26]  accounting software
[2014.26 --> 2015.76]  that you need if
[2015.76 --> 2016.48]  you want to do
[2016.48 --> 2018.22]  awesome stuff like
[2018.22 --> 2021.14]  run a VPS hosting
[2021.14 --> 2021.62]  company.
[2022.08 --> 2022.28]  Hmm.
[2023.18 --> 2023.48]  Or?
[2023.96 --> 2025.50]  Or run two
[2025.50 --> 2026.26]  VPS hosting
[2026.26 --> 2026.58]  companies.
[2026.86 --> 2027.94]  Or run a dog
[2027.94 --> 2028.96]  grooming shop or a
[2028.96 --> 2029.64]  plumbing company.
[2029.64 --> 2031.06]  Any, any, like, I
[2031.06 --> 2031.58]  know a lot of
[2031.58 --> 2031.96]  people in the
[2031.96 --> 2032.60]  audience run
[2032.60 --> 2033.94]  small scale
[2033.94 --> 2035.94]  computer hardware
[2035.94 --> 2037.18]  technician service
[2037.18 --> 2037.64]  companies.
[2037.76 --> 2038.66]  I know I did when
[2038.66 --> 2039.18]  I was younger,
[2039.48 --> 2040.38]  going around doing
[2040.38 --> 2041.68]  small scale IT work
[2041.68 --> 2042.62]  for some businesses
[2042.62 --> 2043.68]  and building
[2043.68 --> 2044.22]  computers for
[2044.22 --> 2045.18]  people and doing
[2045.18 --> 2046.84]  IT stuff around
[2046.84 --> 2047.52]  as much as I
[2047.52 --> 2048.06]  could while I was
[2048.06 --> 2048.54]  going to school
[2048.54 --> 2049.20]  because the hours
[2049.20 --> 2049.80]  were all nice and
[2049.80 --> 2050.64]  flexible because
[2050.64 --> 2051.20]  you're working for
[2051.20 --> 2052.40]  yourself and you
[2052.40 --> 2053.84]  can often just
[2053.84 --> 2054.72]  remote into machines
[2054.72 --> 2055.32]  and fix them from
[2055.32 --> 2055.88]  home and all that
[2055.88 --> 2056.18]  kind of stuff.
[2056.18 --> 2056.94]  It's great and
[2056.94 --> 2057.96]  you can manage the
[2057.96 --> 2058.66]  invoices and
[2058.66 --> 2059.96]  finances that are
[2059.96 --> 2060.78]  a nightmare.
[2061.24 --> 2061.90]  I can tell you from
[2061.90 --> 2062.50]  personal experience
[2062.50 --> 2063.22]  are a nightmare.
[2063.48 --> 2064.32]  If you don't have
[2064.32 --> 2064.92]  fresh books.
[2065.00 --> 2065.46]  If you don't have
[2065.46 --> 2065.96]  fresh books.
[2066.00 --> 2066.58]  You can generate
[2066.58 --> 2067.62]  invoices in an
[2067.62 --> 2068.86]  extremely short
[2068.86 --> 2069.48]  period of time.
[2069.82 --> 2070.68]  You can check if
[2070.68 --> 2071.40]  those people have
[2071.40 --> 2072.22]  seen the invoice.
[2072.58 --> 2073.40]  This is all super
[2073.40 --> 2074.14]  helpful because you
[2074.14 --> 2074.66]  don't want to spend
[2074.66 --> 2075.38]  all your time while
[2075.38 --> 2076.52]  you could be studying
[2076.52 --> 2077.74]  or working or doing
[2077.74 --> 2078.56]  other more productive
[2078.56 --> 2080.36]  things chasing people
[2080.36 --> 2081.24]  down for invoices.
[2081.46 --> 2082.28]  It does it for you
[2082.28 --> 2083.00]  which is great.
[2083.42 --> 2083.90]  You can set up
[2083.90 --> 2084.86]  online payments with
[2084.86 --> 2085.78]  just a couple clicks
[2085.78 --> 2086.44]  which is awesome
[2086.44 --> 2086.88]  and you can get
[2086.88 --> 2087.58]  paid up to four
[2087.58 --> 2088.48]  days faster which
[2088.48 --> 2089.18]  is super cool.
[2090.42 --> 2090.70]  So yeah.
[2090.86 --> 2091.38]  Stop the guessing
[2091.38 --> 2091.74]  games.
[2092.00 --> 2093.00]  Get paid for an
[2093.00 --> 2094.00]  unrestricted 30 day
[2094.00 --> 2094.54]  free trial.
[2094.84 --> 2095.80]  Go to freshbooks.com
[2095.80 --> 2097.08]  slash tech tips and
[2097.08 --> 2097.94]  enter Linus Tech Tips
[2097.94 --> 2098.50]  in the how did you
[2098.50 --> 2099.44]  hear about us section.
[2099.84 --> 2100.60]  Fresh books is great.
[2101.36 --> 2102.42]  And moving on.
[2103.06 --> 2105.82]  If you are doing
[2105.82 --> 2106.58]  what I just said.
[2106.62 --> 2107.32]  Running a small
[2107.32 --> 2108.94]  scale IT business
[2108.94 --> 2109.38]  thing.
[2109.62 --> 2110.28]  You might want to
[2110.28 --> 2110.90]  bring a laptop
[2110.90 --> 2111.90]  somewhere and have
[2111.90 --> 2112.68]  that hooked up and
[2112.68 --> 2113.84]  be able to use your
[2113.84 --> 2114.52]  laptop and the other
[2114.52 --> 2115.50]  computer all at once.
[2115.78 --> 2117.04]  Or there's tons of
[2117.04 --> 2117.80]  other use cases for
[2117.80 --> 2117.98]  this.
[2118.18 --> 2119.34]  Say you go to work
[2119.34 --> 2119.90]  and when you're at
[2119.90 --> 2120.76]  work you work on a
[2120.76 --> 2121.00]  laptop.
[2121.26 --> 2121.84]  I know I was at the
[2121.84 --> 2122.48]  Twitch offices.
[2122.80 --> 2123.38]  We're on Twitch right
[2123.38 --> 2123.62]  now.
[2123.84 --> 2124.26]  I was at the Twitch
[2124.26 --> 2125.08]  offices not that long
[2125.08 --> 2125.24]  ago.
[2125.52 --> 2126.48]  A lot of people worked
[2126.48 --> 2127.30]  on laptops there.
[2127.62 --> 2128.24]  You'd be able to pick
[2128.24 --> 2129.02]  up your laptop from
[2129.02 --> 2129.88]  work where it's
[2129.88 --> 2130.56]  connected into the
[2130.56 --> 2131.16]  monitors and all
[2131.16 --> 2131.84]  nicely hooked up.
[2132.46 --> 2133.30]  Bring it home.
[2133.86 --> 2135.08]  Put that on a dock or
[2135.08 --> 2135.46]  something.
[2135.80 --> 2136.68]  Like just I have a
[2136.68 --> 2137.48]  little laptop holding
[2137.48 --> 2137.80]  arm.
[2138.30 --> 2139.30]  Plug it into power or
[2139.30 --> 2139.56]  whatever.
[2139.90 --> 2140.76]  And over the network
[2140.76 --> 2141.80]  your keyboard or mouse
[2141.80 --> 2143.20]  will connect from your
[2143.20 --> 2143.92]  main computer to your
[2143.92 --> 2144.22]  laptop.
[2144.22 --> 2145.36]  What are you talking
[2145.36 --> 2145.66]  about right now?
[2145.66 --> 2146.36]  You can drag and drop
[2146.36 --> 2147.02]  documents.
[2147.16 --> 2147.88]  What business are you
[2147.88 --> 2148.54]  even talking about?
[2148.60 --> 2148.86]  Synergy.
[2149.90 --> 2150.82]  You didn't say that
[2150.82 --> 2151.06]  yet.
[2151.28 --> 2151.68]  I did.
[2151.90 --> 2152.68]  Synergy 2.
[2152.92 --> 2153.62]  Synergy 2.
[2153.62 --> 2154.14]  The sequel.
[2154.14 --> 2155.20]  Yeah.
[2155.20 --> 2156.48]  This is Synergy 2 not
[2156.48 --> 2157.16]  Synergy 1.
[2158.96 --> 2160.48]  Synergy 2 instead of
[2160.48 --> 2161.46]  just having all the
[2161.46 --> 2162.12]  awesome stuff that
[2162.12 --> 2163.76]  Synergy 1 has and it
[2163.76 --> 2165.50]  has as well like mouse
[2165.50 --> 2166.38]  and keyboard going from
[2166.38 --> 2167.24]  computer to computer
[2167.24 --> 2168.62]  like being able to drag
[2168.62 --> 2169.52]  and drop files.
[2169.78 --> 2170.62]  It working over the
[2170.62 --> 2171.28]  network so you don't
[2171.28 --> 2171.98]  have to plug them in
[2171.98 --> 2172.80]  through USB or anything
[2172.80 --> 2173.44]  you just have to be on
[2173.44 --> 2174.06]  the same network.
[2174.40 --> 2175.60]  It also has stuff like
[2175.60 --> 2176.56]  Cloud Bridge so it can
[2176.56 --> 2178.40]  work across VPNs and
[2178.40 --> 2179.52]  tricky home networks if
[2179.52 --> 2180.46]  you have a weird set up.
[2180.98 --> 2181.54]  And if you get the
[2181.54 --> 2182.86]  Pro version you get to
[2182.86 --> 2183.66]  access other cool
[2183.66 --> 2184.74]  features like clipboard
[2184.74 --> 2185.76]  sharing, drag and drop
[2185.76 --> 2188.06]  files, copy and pasting,
[2188.26 --> 2189.40]  lock screen sync and
[2189.40 --> 2190.64]  tons more which is
[2190.64 --> 2190.82]  great.
[2190.90 --> 2192.08]  It has SSL encryption
[2192.08 --> 2192.98]  which is nice.
[2193.24 --> 2193.72]  You're not going to get
[2193.72 --> 2194.84]  jacked into all the time.
[2195.80 --> 2196.44]  Share anywhere.
[2196.60 --> 2197.28]  Automatically control
[2197.28 --> 2198.70]  any computer without
[2198.70 --> 2200.04]  reconfiguring which is
[2200.04 --> 2200.44]  really nice.
[2200.54 --> 2201.68]  One thing that Synergy 2
[2201.68 --> 2202.52]  is apparently a lot
[2202.52 --> 2203.84]  better at is detecting
[2203.84 --> 2205.92]  computers which is nice
[2205.92 --> 2207.30]  because Synergy was a
[2207.30 --> 2208.06]  little bit harder to
[2208.06 --> 2208.66]  set up before.
[2208.84 --> 2209.66]  It should be easier
[2209.66 --> 2209.92]  now.
[2210.18 --> 2210.28]  Yeah.
[2210.78 --> 2212.00]  So you can go to
[2212.00 --> 2214.08]  this link right here.
[2215.14 --> 2216.24]  Seamless.com slash
[2216.24 --> 2217.54]  Synergy slash WAN
[2217.54 --> 2219.14]  3 specifically.
[2219.38 --> 2220.44]  That 3 there is
[2220.44 --> 2221.30]  important.
[2222.42 --> 2223.48]  And save 50% when you
[2223.48 --> 2223.80]  do that.
[2224.68 --> 2225.10]  Oh wow.
[2225.22 --> 2225.38]  Really?
[2225.62 --> 2226.02]  Booyah.
[2226.86 --> 2227.78]  Not bad.
[2227.98 --> 2228.84]  Save 50%.
[2228.84 --> 2229.20]  Okay.
[2230.04 --> 2231.72]  And then last but not
[2231.72 --> 2232.32]  least we have
[2232.32 --> 2232.88]  Squarespace.
[2233.34 --> 2233.96]  We've had Squarespace
[2233.96 --> 2234.76]  for a long time.
[2235.02 --> 2236.04]  They have 24-7 live
[2236.04 --> 2237.40]  chat and email support.
[2237.40 --> 2238.34]  So if you're running
[2238.34 --> 2239.72]  your little IT business
[2239.72 --> 2242.04]  thing you have Synergy.
[2242.38 --> 2243.36]  You have FreshBooks.
[2243.46 --> 2244.06]  All that is running
[2244.06 --> 2244.44]  nicely.
[2244.72 --> 2245.16]  And you have your
[2245.16 --> 2245.70]  little website
[2245.70 --> 2246.44]  advertising your
[2246.44 --> 2246.80]  services.
[2247.06 --> 2247.94]  And you have troubles
[2247.94 --> 2248.92]  with your site.
[2249.52 --> 2250.36]  You can call their
[2250.36 --> 2251.66]  IT support or you can
[2251.66 --> 2253.24]  live chat or email
[2253.24 --> 2255.12]  their live support.
[2255.54 --> 2256.84]  And it's only 12 bucks
[2256.84 --> 2257.26]  a month.
[2257.32 --> 2257.98]  You get a free domain
[2257.98 --> 2258.88]  if you subscribe for a
[2258.88 --> 2259.68]  year which is cool
[2259.68 --> 2260.94]  because domains you
[2260.94 --> 2262.02]  usually rent them for a
[2262.02 --> 2262.44]  year anyways.
[2262.64 --> 2263.28]  So if you want the
[2263.28 --> 2264.08]  domain for a year you
[2264.08 --> 2264.72]  subscribe for a year.
[2264.82 --> 2265.34]  They come together.
[2265.34 --> 2265.94]  It's all nice.
[2266.26 --> 2266.92]  They have a commerce
[2266.92 --> 2268.32]  module so you can use
[2268.32 --> 2269.54]  their free online store.
[2269.74 --> 2271.04]  They have cover pages
[2271.04 --> 2272.30]  so you can have one
[2272.30 --> 2273.52]  nice beautiful page if
[2273.52 --> 2274.42]  you want that set up.
[2275.28 --> 2276.52]  Or you can even if you
[2276.52 --> 2277.12]  want to have some type
[2277.12 --> 2277.92]  of blog or something
[2277.92 --> 2278.56]  like that you can
[2278.56 --> 2279.54]  publish content in
[2279.54 --> 2280.46]  Apple News format
[2280.46 --> 2281.38]  directly from their
[2281.38 --> 2282.24]  blog module which is
[2282.24 --> 2282.52]  cool.
[2283.28 --> 2284.96]  And if you go to
[2284.96 --> 2286.34]  squarespace.com forward
[2286.34 --> 2287.70]  slash LTT and use
[2287.70 --> 2289.84]  offer code LTT you get
[2289.84 --> 2290.90]  10% off your first
[2290.90 --> 2291.26]  purchase.
[2292.00 --> 2292.90]  So there you go.
[2293.34 --> 2293.90]  Someone in the
[2293.90 --> 2294.76]  Twitch chat was
[2294.76 --> 2295.30]  scrolled by.
[2295.54 --> 2296.68]  It was like what are
[2296.68 --> 2297.36]  those glasses?
[2298.50 --> 2299.44]  You fool!
[2301.12 --> 2302.48]  You don't even know
[2302.48 --> 2303.40]  your own folly.
[2305.16 --> 2305.80]  Oh dear.
[2306.20 --> 2306.40]  All right.
[2306.42 --> 2306.80]  What do you want to
[2306.80 --> 2307.34]  talk about now?
[2308.40 --> 2309.18]  Let's do some fun
[2309.18 --> 2309.66]  stuff here.
[2309.86 --> 2310.08]  Yeah.
[2310.22 --> 2311.00]  Let's go for it.
[2311.14 --> 2311.50]  Pick one.
[2312.14 --> 2312.54]  I believe.
[2312.72 --> 2312.88]  Oh.
[2313.76 --> 2314.10]  That one.
[2314.10 --> 2314.34]  Boring.
[2314.46 --> 2314.62]  Yeah.
[2314.84 --> 2315.12]  Nah.
[2315.38 --> 2315.64]  Okay.
[2315.96 --> 2316.36]  Screw it.
[2316.48 --> 2317.10]  If you have an HP
[2317.10 --> 2321.10]  laptop this is me not
[2321.10 --> 2321.82]  talking about this one.
[2322.06 --> 2322.66]  It might be getting
[2322.66 --> 2323.40]  recalled right now.
[2323.40 --> 2325.00]  There's a big list of
[2325.00 --> 2326.68]  pro books and Zen
[2326.68 --> 2327.38]  books that are getting
[2327.38 --> 2328.24]  recalled because of the
[2328.24 --> 2328.64]  battery.
[2329.88 --> 2331.16]  You can get a free
[2331.16 --> 2332.98]  battery fix from HP if
[2332.98 --> 2333.78]  you send it back in.
[2333.88 --> 2334.64]  Don't bring it to a
[2334.64 --> 2335.82]  third party fixer guy
[2335.82 --> 2337.04]  because these aren't
[2337.04 --> 2337.90]  actually supposed to be
[2337.90 --> 2338.88]  user fixable batteries.
[2339.88 --> 2341.42]  So give it a Google.
[2341.82 --> 2342.38]  Look it up.
[2342.48 --> 2344.48]  See if your HP book or
[2344.48 --> 2345.92]  notebook is one of the
[2345.92 --> 2347.80]  effective ones and get
[2347.80 --> 2348.62]  that puppy fixed.
[2348.62 --> 2349.66]  And no reason to bring
[2349.66 --> 2350.32]  it to a third party
[2350.32 --> 2351.54]  anyways because this is
[2351.54 --> 2353.54]  a actual recall that HP
[2353.54 --> 2355.02]  is asking you to contact
[2355.02 --> 2355.70]  them about so they
[2355.70 --> 2356.18]  should be handling
[2356.18 --> 2356.62]  everything.
[2356.78 --> 2356.94]  Yeah.
[2357.22 --> 2357.44]  Yeah.
[2357.54 --> 2358.56]  So I wouldn't worry about
[2358.56 --> 2358.58]  it.
[2358.58 --> 2359.16]  We don't want to have a
[2359.16 --> 2360.56]  Note 7 situation here.
[2360.78 --> 2362.00]  Just send her in.
[2362.16 --> 2362.40]  Yeah.
[2362.84 --> 2363.08]  Yeah.
[2363.40 --> 2364.10]  That's probably a good
[2364.10 --> 2364.34]  idea.
[2364.68 --> 2365.06]  This one next.
[2366.84 --> 2367.20]  Spotify?
[2367.60 --> 2367.96]  Sure.
[2368.78 --> 2369.04]  All right.
[2369.06 --> 2369.66]  So Spotify.
[2371.32 --> 2372.40]  They're possibly on the
[2372.40 --> 2373.84]  hook for a 1.6 billion
[2373.84 --> 2374.62]  dollar copyright.
[2374.62 --> 2375.34]  A billion.
[2376.06 --> 2376.88]  That's a lot of money.
[2376.88 --> 2377.12]  Why?
[2377.64 --> 2378.40]  That's a huge amount
[2378.40 --> 2378.60]  of money.
[2378.62 --> 2379.40]  Why you might ask?
[2379.74 --> 2380.46]  Because they've been
[2380.46 --> 2382.04]  streaming songs without
[2382.04 --> 2383.08]  giving money or getting
[2383.08 --> 2384.42]  consent from the owners
[2384.42 --> 2385.32]  of those songs.
[2386.34 --> 2386.56]  Yeah.
[2386.76 --> 2387.28]  Pretty much.
[2388.04 --> 2389.64]  So it's what's the name
[2389.64 --> 2390.22]  of the company?
[2390.44 --> 2391.64]  Wixen Music Publishing.
[2391.82 --> 2392.00]  Yeah.
[2392.08 --> 2393.24]  They've got Tom Petty,
[2393.34 --> 2394.70]  Neil Young, and Rage
[2394.70 --> 2395.46]  Against the Machines,
[2395.56 --> 2397.12]  Tom Morello, and many
[2397.12 --> 2397.50]  more.
[2397.82 --> 2398.88]  So that's some pretty
[2398.88 --> 2400.06]  major names.
[2401.10 --> 2402.30]  Last summer, Spotify
[2402.30 --> 2403.96]  faced a suggested $43
[2403.96 --> 2404.98]  million dollar settlement
[2404.98 --> 2406.38]  which is still yet to be
[2406.38 --> 2407.30]  approved in court.
[2408.04 --> 2409.74]  And they also agreed to
[2409.74 --> 2410.74]  a $30 million dollar
[2410.74 --> 2412.14]  settlement with National
[2412.14 --> 2413.98]  Music Publishers Association
[2413.98 --> 2415.94]  and MPA for unpaid
[2415.94 --> 2417.16]  royalties in 2016.
[2417.48 --> 2418.40]  So they're just getting
[2418.40 --> 2419.68]  stomped on.
[2419.68 --> 2420.18]  You've got to license
[2420.18 --> 2421.08]  that content, bro.
[2421.30 --> 2421.58]  Yeah.
[2421.96 --> 2423.20]  Speaking of music
[2423.20 --> 2424.20]  streaming, rumor,
[2424.56 --> 2425.54]  rumor has it,
[2425.90 --> 2426.84]  that YouTube,
[2427.36 --> 2428.96]  a groan, YouTube is
[2428.96 --> 2429.82]  going to launch a music
[2429.82 --> 2430.48]  streaming service.
[2430.94 --> 2431.82]  Why, you might ask,
[2431.86 --> 2432.68]  since Google Play
[2432.68 --> 2433.54]  services already, or
[2433.54 --> 2434.18]  Google Play Music
[2434.18 --> 2434.84]  already exists?
[2435.58 --> 2436.20]  We don't know.
[2437.98 --> 2438.96]  This would actually be
[2438.96 --> 2440.84]  Alphabet, the parent
[2440.84 --> 2441.60]  company of Google and
[2441.60 --> 2441.82]  YouTube.
[2442.20 --> 2443.08]  This would be their
[2443.08 --> 2444.54]  third attempt at a music
[2444.54 --> 2445.38]  service, actually.
[2446.34 --> 2447.18]  Because Google Play
[2447.18 --> 2448.16]  Music launched in 2011
[2448.16 --> 2450.18]  and to my estimation is
[2450.18 --> 2451.04]  doing just fine.
[2451.82 --> 2452.68]  But on top of that,
[2452.76 --> 2453.16]  I use it.
[2453.30 --> 2454.30]  They had something called,
[2454.48 --> 2455.18]  yeah, I just switched to
[2455.18 --> 2456.02]  it from Spotify, actually,
[2456.10 --> 2457.04]  and I am digging that
[2457.04 --> 2457.52]  algorithm.
[2457.84 --> 2458.28]  That's pretty good.
[2458.28 --> 2459.28]  Of course the algorithm's
[2459.28 --> 2459.40]  awesome.
[2459.40 --> 2459.62]  Yeah.
[2459.96 --> 2460.40]  Of course.
[2460.72 --> 2461.36]  Why would you think that
[2461.36 --> 2462.36]  someone like Spotify could
[2462.36 --> 2463.48]  beat Google, who owns
[2463.48 --> 2463.76]  YouTube?
[2463.96 --> 2464.84]  YouTube, by the way, being
[2464.84 --> 2466.08]  the second largest search
[2466.08 --> 2467.04]  engine in the world, is
[2467.04 --> 2467.62]  bigger than Bing.
[2467.80 --> 2468.98]  YouTube search engines is
[2468.98 --> 2469.26]  huge.
[2469.82 --> 2471.74]  Their algorithm for what to
[2471.74 --> 2473.84]  play next keeps you on
[2473.84 --> 2475.58]  YouTube for hours doing not
[2475.58 --> 2476.36]  what you're supposed to do.
[2476.36 --> 2476.42]  Have you noticed?
[2476.42 --> 2476.72]  Yeah.
[2477.14 --> 2478.72]  So obviously their music
[2478.72 --> 2479.32]  algorithm's great.
[2479.44 --> 2481.16]  You can search a song and
[2481.16 --> 2482.06]  it'll just go for the rest
[2482.06 --> 2482.22]  of the night.
[2482.28 --> 2482.70]  It's awesome.
[2483.26 --> 2484.24]  Oh, someone said Google Play
[2484.24 --> 2485.30]  Music streaming service is not
[2485.30 --> 2485.98]  supported by my company.
[2486.22 --> 2487.30]  That pisses me off a huge
[2487.30 --> 2488.30]  amount about YouTube Red.
[2488.30 --> 2489.22]  Oh my goodness.
[2489.34 --> 2490.20]  I want to watch, I think
[2490.20 --> 2491.00]  it's called Minefield.
[2491.32 --> 2491.54]  Yeah.
[2491.60 --> 2492.48]  It's by Vsauce.
[2494.62 --> 2495.58]  It's on YouTube Red.
[2495.62 --> 2496.74]  I can't do the thing.
[2496.82 --> 2497.04]  Yeah.
[2497.64 --> 2498.38]  That's the teaser.
[2498.50 --> 2499.34]  They give you one episode
[2499.34 --> 2500.54]  to watch and then you got a
[2500.54 --> 2501.08]  YouTube Reddit.
[2501.26 --> 2503.38]  I think I might like subscribe
[2503.38 --> 2504.56]  temporarily while we're in
[2504.56 --> 2506.40]  Vegas and just try to like
[2506.40 --> 2507.04]  binge the entire thing.
[2507.04 --> 2508.44]  You don't have time.
[2508.72 --> 2508.98]  Yeah.
[2509.84 --> 2510.36]  Do you?
[2510.62 --> 2511.78]  If you have time to watch
[2511.78 --> 2512.84]  that, then that gives me a,
[2512.94 --> 2513.60]  that puts me at ease.
[2513.60 --> 2514.36]  No, I don't.
[2515.56 --> 2516.60]  Every time that I go to
[2516.60 --> 2517.48]  CES, I'm like, oh, I'm
[2517.48 --> 2518.12]  going to do all these things.
[2518.12 --> 2518.58]  I'm going to bring my
[2518.58 --> 2519.18]  personal camera.
[2519.28 --> 2519.88]  I'm going to take cool
[2519.88 --> 2520.26]  photos.
[2520.54 --> 2521.06]  I'm going to do all this
[2521.06 --> 2522.50]  kind of cool extra stuff on
[2522.50 --> 2522.84]  the side.
[2522.92 --> 2523.78]  And then it's like, nope,
[2523.82 --> 2526.24]  you work from like eight to
[2526.24 --> 2528.62]  like three and then you
[2528.62 --> 2530.36]  sleep for a few hours and
[2530.36 --> 2531.16]  then you get back up and
[2531.16 --> 2531.46]  keep going.
[2531.70 --> 2532.70]  I'm really hoping just to
[2532.70 --> 2533.36]  eat meals.
[2533.60 --> 2534.60]  That's all I want.
[2534.72 --> 2535.76]  I want to go to Vegas and
[2535.76 --> 2536.58]  actually be able to hit at
[2536.58 --> 2537.28]  least one buffet.
[2537.54 --> 2538.84]  You'll probably average one
[2538.84 --> 2540.02]  or two a day.
[2540.02 --> 2540.30]  Yeah.
[2540.38 --> 2540.56]  Okay.
[2540.64 --> 2540.90]  Meals.
[2541.06 --> 2541.20]  Yeah.
[2541.26 --> 2541.40]  Yeah.
[2541.40 --> 2541.56]  Yeah.
[2541.56 --> 2542.44]  I don't want to just have
[2542.44 --> 2544.18]  to eat that Sparrow pizza
[2544.18 --> 2545.42]  that's in the convention
[2545.42 --> 2546.58]  center the whole time.
[2546.70 --> 2546.84]  Yeah.
[2546.84 --> 2547.44]  There is.
[2547.56 --> 2547.78]  Okay.
[2548.02 --> 2549.62]  There's some hidden spots in
[2549.62 --> 2550.76]  the convention center on
[2550.76 --> 2551.22]  floor two.
[2551.24 --> 2551.92]  Teach me your ways.
[2552.06 --> 2552.24]  Yeah.
[2552.38 --> 2553.02]  Don't tell them.
[2553.18 --> 2554.58]  Don't tell everyone here
[2554.58 --> 2555.52]  that they won't be hidden.
[2555.76 --> 2556.42]  That's a good call.
[2556.52 --> 2557.46]  So back to the chronology
[2557.46 --> 2558.62]  after Google play came out
[2558.62 --> 2559.96]  in 2011, a thing that I
[2559.96 --> 2560.90]  had never heard of called
[2560.90 --> 2563.04]  YouTube music key came
[2563.04 --> 2564.72]  along in 2014, which gave
[2564.72 --> 2566.34]  subscribers ad free music
[2566.34 --> 2567.98]  videos, which is awesome
[2567.98 --> 2569.96]  because obviously a ton of
[2569.96 --> 2571.02]  awesome music and remixes
[2571.02 --> 2571.70]  and everything there on
[2571.70 --> 2572.76]  YouTube, but you hit play,
[2572.86 --> 2573.62]  you try to put that on a
[2573.62 --> 2574.54]  party and then ads
[2574.54 --> 2576.18]  interrupt it and you look like
[2576.18 --> 2576.66]  a dork.
[2577.66 --> 2580.18]  But then YouTube music key
[2580.18 --> 2581.30]  kind of just turned into
[2581.30 --> 2583.86]  YouTube red in 2016.
[2584.10 --> 2584.56]  Yeah.
[2584.56 --> 2586.16]  Which expands to letting you
[2586.16 --> 2587.42]  watch any video without
[2587.42 --> 2589.14]  advertising and now it's just
[2589.14 --> 2590.90]  kind of like its own thing.
[2592.16 --> 2592.68]  So.
[2592.90 --> 2594.28]  So they keep just changing
[2594.28 --> 2596.10]  stuff in super weird ways.
[2596.64 --> 2598.18]  This service, this alleged
[2598.74 --> 2600.46]  rumored service is internally
[2600.46 --> 2601.74]  referred to as remix.
[2601.74 --> 2602.74]  Yes.
[2603.12 --> 2603.36]  Okay.
[2603.82 --> 2605.14]  It's going to have on demand
[2605.14 --> 2608.04]  elements like a regular,
[2608.16 --> 2609.30]  like a Spotify, but it's also
[2609.30 --> 2610.22]  going to have some YouTube
[2610.22 --> 2611.48]  elements, maybe like some
[2611.48 --> 2612.82]  video clips, maybe some lyrics
[2612.82 --> 2613.38]  on screen.
[2613.46 --> 2613.86]  That'd be nice.
[2613.96 --> 2617.22]  So you can already do YouTube
[2617.22 --> 2618.34]  music videos through Google
[2618.34 --> 2619.26]  play music, but all right.
[2619.42 --> 2619.94]  All right.
[2619.94 --> 2621.06]  I don't know.
[2621.10 --> 2622.38]  I think part of this might
[2622.38 --> 2623.68]  come from the supply side.
[2624.30 --> 2626.08]  Apparently some of the
[2626.08 --> 2629.02]  creators whose music is
[2629.02 --> 2629.88]  getting listened to through
[2629.88 --> 2630.74]  YouTube, they don't feel like
[2630.74 --> 2632.18]  they're getting compensated as
[2632.18 --> 2633.92]  fairly as they would be on
[2633.92 --> 2634.98]  dedicated music streaming
[2634.98 --> 2636.02]  services like Google play
[2636.02 --> 2637.10]  music or on Spotify.
[2637.24 --> 2638.26]  So it might be like a money
[2638.26 --> 2638.52]  thing.
[2640.16 --> 2640.56]  Okay.
[2640.74 --> 2641.78]  They put it on there.
[2642.58 --> 2643.12]  But yeah, okay.
[2643.68 --> 2644.96]  Yeah, I guess.
[2644.96 --> 2648.04]  You give him an inch.
[2649.22 --> 2650.08]  I don't know.
[2650.16 --> 2650.54]  I don't know.
[2650.62 --> 2650.80]  Yeah.
[2651.44 --> 2652.80]  As for deploying this thing,
[2653.24 --> 2655.00]  Warner Music Group is already
[2655.00 --> 2655.36]  on board.
[2655.48 --> 2657.32]  They're one of the big three in
[2657.32 --> 2657.98]  the music business.
[2657.98 --> 2660.12]  And the other two of the three
[2660.12 --> 2661.64]  are already in talks with
[2661.64 --> 2661.94]  YouTube.
[2661.94 --> 2663.30]  That includes Sony Music
[2663.30 --> 2664.34]  Entertainment and Universal
[2664.34 --> 2665.04]  Music Group.
[2665.62 --> 2667.24]  They're also talking to Merlin,
[2667.44 --> 2670.74]  a consortium of independent
[2670.74 --> 2671.08]  labels.
[2671.58 --> 2672.42]  So hopefully they'll have a good
[2672.42 --> 2673.40]  spread on content.
[2674.60 --> 2674.82]  Yeah.
[2674.96 --> 2676.88]  I like, I don't know.
[2676.94 --> 2679.04]  It'll probably be good.
[2679.34 --> 2681.10]  It seems weird because it
[2681.10 --> 2682.46]  seems like Alphabet is now
[2682.46 --> 2684.22]  creating things to compete
[2684.22 --> 2685.82]  against themselves.
[2686.14 --> 2686.46]  Yeah.
[2686.80 --> 2688.46]  This is like a Hangouts
[2688.46 --> 2689.66]  Allo.
[2689.72 --> 2690.20]  Yeah.
[2690.36 --> 2690.56]  Duo.
[2691.20 --> 2692.36]  Yeah, that's a good call.
[2692.44 --> 2693.24]  So maybe it's not that weird
[2693.24 --> 2693.58]  for them.
[2693.76 --> 2695.02]  It's because they're so
[2695.02 --> 2696.74]  federated that they don't talk
[2696.74 --> 2697.76]  and they step on each other
[2697.76 --> 2698.22]  all the time.
[2698.38 --> 2698.60]  Yeah.
[2700.10 --> 2701.50]  Anyways, going back to the
[2701.50 --> 2702.22]  Google Play Music thing.
[2702.34 --> 2703.04]  One of my favorite things
[2703.04 --> 2704.92]  about it is just how creepy
[2704.92 --> 2705.32]  it is.
[2706.44 --> 2707.86]  It'll pull in a lot of data,
[2707.96 --> 2708.68]  which is unsurprising
[2708.68 --> 2709.32]  because it's Google.
[2709.52 --> 2710.42]  So it'll like know when
[2710.42 --> 2710.92]  you're at the gym.
[2711.64 --> 2711.80]  Yeah.
[2711.96 --> 2712.14]  Yeah.
[2712.22 --> 2713.40]  You can turn on
[2713.40 --> 2715.06]  location services.
[2715.30 --> 2715.84]  Location services.
[2715.98 --> 2716.74]  Location services.
[2716.74 --> 2717.24]  Location services.
[2717.24 --> 2718.66]  So it's like, huh, I see
[2718.66 --> 2719.62]  you're in the border lineup.
[2719.84 --> 2720.90]  I'm going to play gangster
[2720.90 --> 2722.18]  rap to make you look sus.
[2724.56 --> 2724.96]  Yeah.
[2724.96 --> 2726.72]  I don't know.
[2726.72 --> 2728.84]  It's interesting.
[2729.10 --> 2729.78]  Every once in a while,
[2729.86 --> 2730.68]  I'll just jump into the
[2730.68 --> 2731.52]  different playlists that it
[2731.52 --> 2732.94]  recommends for me to try to
[2732.94 --> 2734.54]  see where it's trying to take
[2734.54 --> 2734.72]  me.
[2735.10 --> 2736.30]  And sometimes, you know,
[2736.38 --> 2738.02]  it'll go off in totally a
[2738.02 --> 2738.52]  weird direction.
[2738.64 --> 2739.36]  I'm like, I don't like any of
[2739.36 --> 2739.66]  this stuff.
[2739.86 --> 2741.14]  But often it's pretty good.
[2741.36 --> 2742.12]  I've been happy with it
[2742.12 --> 2743.32]  because when I had two
[2743.32 --> 2744.10]  problems with Spotify.
[2744.44 --> 2746.66]  The first was the Discover
[2746.66 --> 2748.48]  playlist was just like stuff I
[2748.48 --> 2749.50]  didn't listen to at all.
[2750.34 --> 2752.80]  And the second was now,
[2752.94 --> 2753.94]  maybe you can do this on
[2753.94 --> 2754.76]  certain services with
[2754.76 --> 2756.34]  Spotify, but I usually use
[2756.34 --> 2758.58]  this with my TV and my
[2758.58 --> 2759.12]  Google Home.
[2759.62 --> 2760.82]  And what I want to do is I
[2760.82 --> 2762.32]  have a song on this on in
[2762.32 --> 2763.22]  my head and I'm like, I
[2763.22 --> 2764.52]  want to play this song and
[2764.52 --> 2765.82]  then that's all I want to
[2765.82 --> 2765.92]  do.
[2765.98 --> 2766.82]  And after that, I wanted to
[2766.82 --> 2768.16]  just go forever playing
[2768.16 --> 2768.96]  related music.
[2769.38 --> 2770.60]  And Google Play Music is
[2770.60 --> 2771.32]  wicked at that.
[2771.42 --> 2772.02]  It's very good at that.
[2772.08 --> 2773.58]  Not only will it play other
[2773.58 --> 2775.18]  songs that you'll like, they
[2775.18 --> 2775.88]  might not even be from
[2775.88 --> 2776.76]  bands you know of.
[2776.88 --> 2776.98]  Yeah.
[2777.04 --> 2778.24]  I started with a Nine Inch Nails
[2778.24 --> 2778.86]  song the other day.
[2778.86 --> 2779.82]  Nine Inch Nails Die
[2779.82 --> 2780.02]  Hard.
[2780.68 --> 2782.10]  The next 10 songs are for
[2782.10 --> 2783.00]  bands I never heard of.
[2783.06 --> 2783.98]  I didn't skip a single one.
[2784.02 --> 2784.72]  They're so sweet.
[2784.86 --> 2785.06]  Nice.
[2785.52 --> 2786.96]  I actually really like doing
[2786.96 --> 2787.48]  that sometimes.
[2787.58 --> 2788.10]  Yeah, it's wicked.
[2788.18 --> 2789.08]  If you try to do this on
[2789.08 --> 2790.22]  Spotify, guess what the
[2790.22 --> 2791.20]  second song will be.
[2791.86 --> 2793.86]  The second song will be the
[2793.86 --> 2795.06]  same song again because
[2795.06 --> 2797.30]  instead of playing the song
[2797.30 --> 2798.38]  you search for and then a
[2798.38 --> 2799.44]  bunch of related songs, it
[2799.44 --> 2801.28]  will play all the search
[2801.28 --> 2801.70]  results.
[2802.56 --> 2803.16]  So it'll be like.
[2804.20 --> 2805.64]  So you try to put on.
[2806.28 --> 2807.40]  So it'll be like that same
[2807.40 --> 2808.84]  song or like remixed by
[2808.84 --> 2809.38]  someone else.
[2809.38 --> 2810.46]  You try to put on
[2810.46 --> 2810.96]  Starway to Heaven.
[2811.08 --> 2811.66]  You get Starway to Heaven.
[2811.76 --> 2812.46]  Then you get live.
[2812.66 --> 2813.38]  Then you get cover.
[2813.70 --> 2814.52]  It's like, yes.
[2814.72 --> 2815.34]  Yes, Spotify.
[2815.56 --> 2816.56]  This is what I wanted.
[2818.20 --> 2819.94]  No one's ever wanted this.
[2820.64 --> 2822.78]  I'm going to hopefully troll at
[2822.78 --> 2823.58]  least one person.
[2824.58 --> 2825.30]  Okay, Google.
[2825.72 --> 2826.98]  Play that hipster song with
[2826.98 --> 2827.42]  the whistling.
[2828.42 --> 2828.74]  Okay.
[2828.82 --> 2829.76]  So that's in one of their.
[2830.62 --> 2831.16]  You jerk.
[2831.80 --> 2832.32]  Did it work?
[2833.38 --> 2833.86]  No.
[2834.08 --> 2834.32]  No.
[2834.44 --> 2834.68]  Dang.
[2835.28 --> 2836.38]  Oh, I should have said with
[2836.38 --> 2837.10]  Google Play Music.
[2837.38 --> 2838.68]  Sometimes it gets confused if
[2838.68 --> 2839.40]  you don't include that.
[2839.48 --> 2839.88]  I don't know why.
[2840.08 --> 2841.26]  It's because you can have a
[2841.26 --> 2842.34]  different default music player.
[2842.48 --> 2842.72]  Yeah.
[2842.80 --> 2843.10]  Yeah.
[2843.18 --> 2844.32]  So if you have two installed,
[2844.42 --> 2845.58]  it might have to like ask or
[2845.58 --> 2845.84]  whatever.
[2846.20 --> 2847.66]  But you got me.
[2847.78 --> 2848.48]  It did it.
[2848.58 --> 2848.90]  Yes.
[2849.02 --> 2849.62]  Some people got it.
[2849.62 --> 2849.78]  Okay.
[2850.20 --> 2851.46]  Now let it keep going.
[2852.50 --> 2853.76]  You can even mute it and leave
[2853.76 --> 2854.98]  it off on the side or whatever,
[2855.14 --> 2856.30]  but let it keep going.
[2856.44 --> 2857.80]  It does a pretty good job.
[2857.80 --> 2859.24]  And it doesn't just stick with.
[2859.24 --> 2860.30]  It'll continue to play hipster
[2860.30 --> 2860.84]  whistle songs?
[2861.30 --> 2862.34]  Or what do you mean that good
[2862.34 --> 2862.62]  job?
[2862.74 --> 2864.42]  Well, it continues to play
[2864.42 --> 2867.24]  hipstery kind of songs, but
[2867.24 --> 2868.82]  that actually sound kind of
[2868.82 --> 2870.56]  similar and fun with the same
[2870.56 --> 2872.02]  tonality and all these other
[2872.02 --> 2872.42]  kind of things.
[2872.82 --> 2874.16]  It does a pretty good job.
[2874.48 --> 2877.76]  I ended up already canceled.
[2877.96 --> 2878.96]  Some people are like, no,
[2879.30 --> 2879.78]  screw it.
[2880.96 --> 2882.04]  Someone actually said it didn't
[2882.04 --> 2882.70]  recognize the voice.
[2882.80 --> 2882.88]  Yeah.
[2883.36 --> 2884.64]  Yeah, I've got that recently.
[2884.72 --> 2885.66]  Someone tried to troll me and
[2885.66 --> 2887.04]  then Google was like, that
[2887.04 --> 2887.82]  doesn't sound like James.
[2887.96 --> 2888.18]  Yeah.
[2888.42 --> 2889.94]  My girlfriend even trying to
[2889.94 --> 2891.02]  impersonate my voice couldn't
[2891.02 --> 2892.46]  get into my phone using
[2892.46 --> 2892.68]  voice.
[2892.68 --> 2893.36]  That's not surprising.
[2893.76 --> 2893.98]  Yeah.
[2894.38 --> 2895.28]  Yeah, I know, but it's just
[2895.28 --> 2896.08]  interesting.
[2896.22 --> 2896.92]  It did a pretty good job.
[2898.04 --> 2899.18]  I would love to hear your
[2899.18 --> 2899.88]  three devices.
[2901.38 --> 2902.68]  Some guy said three devices
[2902.68 --> 2903.56]  are playing that song in my
[2903.56 --> 2904.00]  house right now.
[2904.20 --> 2905.40]  When I did the, there was a
[2905.40 --> 2906.40]  previous WAN show where I did
[2906.40 --> 2908.02]  a similar command with some
[2908.02 --> 2909.04]  weird Russian song that goes
[2909.04 --> 2909.40]  Yes.
[2910.40 --> 2910.60]  Yes.
[2910.78 --> 2911.78]  People kept tweeting me like,
[2912.00 --> 2913.78]  man, it was 1 a.m.
[2913.78 --> 2915.32]  My whole family is awake now.
[2915.88 --> 2916.52]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[2916.52 --> 2918.26]  We got to, we put a lockdown
[2918.26 --> 2918.98]  on that recently.
[2919.22 --> 2919.50]  Okay.
[2919.50 --> 2921.14]  So maybe, maybe that was bad.
[2921.14 --> 2921.86]  You did it on purpose.
[2922.00 --> 2922.42]  I did.
[2922.58 --> 2923.62]  It's the accidental ones we're
[2923.62 --> 2924.14]  looking out for.
[2924.40 --> 2925.54]  Hey, there's actually an Amazon
[2925.54 --> 2927.52]  Echo topic here we can go
[2927.52 --> 2927.98]  right into.
[2928.08 --> 2928.30]  Sure.
[2928.74 --> 2931.74]  So this has to do with Amazon
[2931.74 --> 2934.58]  trying to monetize and place
[2934.58 --> 2936.72]  ad units into Echo devices.
[2936.96 --> 2939.06]  So there's a thread on the
[2939.06 --> 2940.94]  forum by Mankeys who actually
[2940.94 --> 2943.06]  pretty much supplied a lot of,
[2943.24 --> 2944.44]  almost all of the threads
[2944.44 --> 2944.80]  today.
[2945.36 --> 2945.96]  Thank you, Mankeys.
[2945.96 --> 2946.74]  Thank you very much.
[2946.84 --> 2948.36]  However, I kind of think that
[2948.36 --> 2950.98]  your, your title for this is
[2950.98 --> 2953.66]  fake news because as far as I
[2953.66 --> 2955.38]  read, it's not the case that
[2955.38 --> 2956.82]  your Amazon Echo is going to be
[2956.82 --> 2959.86]  reading out ads to you.
[2959.92 --> 2961.06]  That would be so brutal.
[2961.80 --> 2963.60]  As far as I've seen, I don't
[2963.60 --> 2964.30]  think that's what they're trying
[2964.30 --> 2964.56]  to do.
[2964.64 --> 2965.76]  But what they are trying to do
[2965.76 --> 2968.82]  is have brands be like the
[2968.82 --> 2970.42]  sponsored search results.
[2970.50 --> 2971.46]  So just like when you Google
[2971.46 --> 2973.80]  something, if you Google new
[2973.80 --> 2974.98]  truck, there's going to be a
[2974.98 --> 2976.06]  Ford ad at the top of your
[2976.06 --> 2977.10]  search results page, right?
[2977.44 --> 2979.20]  But now we're talking about
[2979.20 --> 2979.54]  voice.
[2979.62 --> 2980.50]  So there's no page.
[2980.72 --> 2981.90]  There's just, there's going to
[2981.90 --> 2983.24]  be a suggested product.
[2983.50 --> 2985.26]  So if you ask, like there's an
[2985.26 --> 2986.38]  example here that says if you
[2986.38 --> 2988.96]  ask A-L-E-X-A, because we're
[2988.96 --> 2990.20]  not trying to trigger the vocal
[2990.20 --> 2991.02]  commands anymore.
[2991.16 --> 2991.64]  Good idea.
[2992.08 --> 2993.90]  To add an item to your shopping
[2993.90 --> 2995.08]  cart, it will suggest you buy a
[2995.08 --> 2995.58]  particular brand.
[2995.58 --> 2998.28]  So I think that means like A-L-E-X-A,
[2998.72 --> 3001.10]  can you add some toothpaste to my
[3001.10 --> 3001.58]  shopping cart?
[3001.84 --> 3003.78]  And it'll be like, okay, I can
[3003.78 --> 3005.06]  look for a brand like Colgate.
[3005.12 --> 3005.80]  Would you like that?
[3005.98 --> 3007.46]  And if you're like, no, it can
[3007.46 --> 3008.70]  find some other stuff.
[3008.76 --> 3010.12]  But the default matters because a
[3010.12 --> 3010.84]  lot of people are going to be
[3010.84 --> 3012.34]  like, yeah, instead of being
[3012.34 --> 3014.22]  like, no, actually, I would like
[3014.22 --> 3015.08]  Sensodyne Complete.
[3015.52 --> 3015.72]  Yeah.
[3015.72 --> 3017.46]  Because I got little wimpy teeth.
[3018.58 --> 3019.70]  I don't floss.
[3021.46 --> 3022.64]  So, yeah.
[3022.64 --> 3025.36]  That is really interesting.
[3025.60 --> 3026.16]  It's pretty problematic.
[3030.20 --> 3030.68]  Yeah.
[3030.86 --> 3033.54]  So apparently it might suggest it
[3033.54 --> 3035.42]  based on your previous purchasing
[3035.42 --> 3037.58]  decisions, which is not that bad.
[3037.88 --> 3039.36]  So that would be a situation like,
[3040.10 --> 3043.58]  hey, A-L-E-X-A, I would like some
[3043.58 --> 3044.42]  surface cleaner.
[3045.12 --> 3047.34]  And they know that you bought a
[3047.34 --> 3050.02]  Clorox product in the past.
[3050.14 --> 3052.12]  So they'll say, okay, do you want
[3052.12 --> 3054.24]  Clorox Pine Sol?
[3054.74 --> 3056.26]  That kind of makes sense.
[3057.20 --> 3058.90]  It's going to keep people in a
[3058.90 --> 3060.78]  little bubble, which is maybe not
[3060.78 --> 3061.18]  great.
[3061.36 --> 3062.62]  But if you're just trying to order
[3062.62 --> 3063.60]  something with a voice command,
[3063.68 --> 3064.68]  you're probably not trying to shop
[3064.68 --> 3065.02]  around.
[3065.34 --> 3066.28]  You're probably just trying to stay
[3066.28 --> 3066.84]  within your bubble.
[3067.00 --> 3067.66]  You probably just want the
[3067.66 --> 3068.72]  transaction done faster.
[3069.18 --> 3070.62]  So that's maybe not a bad thing.
[3070.86 --> 3072.04]  I'd be interested in hearing what
[3072.04 --> 3073.40]  other people have opinions in
[3073.40 --> 3073.78]  terms of that.
[3074.00 --> 3075.48]  If I'm making a purchasing decision
[3075.48 --> 3077.64]  that I'm even remotely unsure of,
[3077.92 --> 3078.90]  I always research.
[3079.08 --> 3080.50]  This is probably for your second
[3080.50 --> 3082.10]  time buying something anyway, right?
[3082.48 --> 3084.24]  And it says that it's going to
[3084.24 --> 3085.32]  suggest things based on what
[3085.32 --> 3086.36]  people have previously bought.
[3086.62 --> 3087.84]  So if you've already bought one of
[3087.84 --> 3088.86]  these and you're like, hey, I need
[3088.86 --> 3089.32]  some toothpaste.
[3089.68 --> 3090.44]  And you've been buying the same
[3090.44 --> 3091.64]  toothpaste for freaking ever.
[3091.84 --> 3092.60]  And it's like, hey, do you want
[3092.60 --> 3093.64]  the same toothpaste that you've been
[3093.64 --> 3094.88]  buying for freaking ever?
[3095.40 --> 3096.08]  You'll just say yes.
[3096.20 --> 3096.54]  And then it'll show up.
[3096.54 --> 3097.24]  Well, that's what we want.
[3097.30 --> 3099.44]  But now we're talking about that not
[3099.44 --> 3100.78]  happening because of sponsored posts.
[3101.46 --> 3101.78]  Yeah.
[3102.30 --> 3103.30]  Do you want the thing you've always
[3103.30 --> 3103.66]  been getting?
[3103.74 --> 3105.08]  Or do you want this new featured
[3105.08 --> 3107.16]  product that maybe sucks, but they
[3107.16 --> 3107.68]  paid money?
[3107.68 --> 3110.36]  So that's what is going to be the
[3110.36 --> 3110.68]  default.
[3111.10 --> 3111.40]  Yeah.
[3111.94 --> 3112.30]  Interesting.
[3113.10 --> 3115.32]  It would be cool if they had a voice
[3115.32 --> 3117.32]  command for like, no, I'd like the
[3117.32 --> 3117.72]  usual.
[3118.26 --> 3118.86]  The use.
[3119.02 --> 3119.68]  You know what I mean?
[3120.24 --> 3122.52]  Like if you're a usual.
[3123.18 --> 3123.94]  On the use.
[3124.28 --> 3124.50]  Yeah.
[3124.72 --> 3126.22]  If you're a usual customer at a
[3126.22 --> 3127.52]  restaurant, they might know what you
[3127.52 --> 3127.78]  want.
[3127.86 --> 3129.56]  Like the dude at Mucho Burrito knows
[3129.56 --> 3130.12]  my order.
[3131.86 --> 3133.42]  The people at Subway over here, they
[3133.42 --> 3133.88]  know me too.
[3134.26 --> 3134.44]  Yeah.
[3134.52 --> 3135.40]  It took them like six months.
[3135.40 --> 3137.20]  I have a very simple order.
[3137.70 --> 3139.24]  I get everything for the veggies.
[3139.40 --> 3139.78]  Like everything.
[3140.16 --> 3140.26]  Yeah.
[3140.30 --> 3141.70]  So it's like they have two decisions.
[3142.14 --> 3142.98]  Anyway, they're on it now.
[3143.26 --> 3144.18]  Here's my question.
[3144.28 --> 3145.18]  And I think this is interesting.
[3145.28 --> 3146.12]  I don't know.
[3146.96 --> 3148.90]  I think there's a, if you're a glass
[3148.90 --> 3150.28]  half full person or a glass half
[3150.28 --> 3151.12]  empty person, you might have two
[3151.12 --> 3151.58]  answers here.
[3151.68 --> 3151.88]  Okay.
[3152.36 --> 3155.80]  Is it likely that Google will also
[3155.80 --> 3158.76]  seek to monetize in similar ways?
[3159.10 --> 3161.00]  I wouldn't be surprised if they
[3161.00 --> 3161.68]  already are.
[3161.72 --> 3163.56]  They're the main advertiser in this
[3163.56 --> 3164.12]  space, right?
[3164.12 --> 3166.82]  But is it antithetical to Google's
[3166.82 --> 3168.92]  mission statement or corporate
[3168.92 --> 3169.48]  culture?
[3169.88 --> 3171.90]  Given that they're coming from a
[3171.90 --> 3173.22]  place where they're taking the
[3173.22 --> 3175.44]  world's information and putting
[3175.44 --> 3177.56]  down onto one search page, they're
[3177.56 --> 3178.38]  giving you options.
[3178.60 --> 3179.48]  It's democratic.
[3179.92 --> 3181.60]  It's supposed to be based on like
[3181.60 --> 3184.64]  the link juice of the internet, you
[3184.64 --> 3185.68]  know, the democracy, the
[3185.68 --> 3188.42]  popularity contest of the internet
[3188.42 --> 3188.76]  here.
[3189.46 --> 3191.20]  When you get into voice, you only get
[3191.20 --> 3192.26]  one answer.
[3193.20 --> 3194.90]  So does Google do the same thing
[3194.90 --> 3195.82]  Amazon's doing?
[3196.56 --> 3198.02]  Or do they never do that?
[3198.98 --> 3200.02]  I suspect they will.
[3201.18 --> 3201.48]  I absolutely suspect they will.
[3201.48 --> 3202.42]  Gotta get that green.
[3202.78 --> 3203.02]  Yeah.
[3203.40 --> 3206.20]  Paid advertising is Google's whole
[3206.20 --> 3206.66]  thing.
[3206.82 --> 3207.82]  I would highly suggest they would.
[3208.20 --> 3210.20]  This is just making me think like we
[3210.20 --> 3211.48]  need more competition for Amazon.
[3211.48 --> 3211.58]  Amazon.
[3213.18 --> 3215.36]  Because like with Google's situation,
[3215.46 --> 3216.68]  what is it going to suggest you buy?
[3217.76 --> 3219.36]  Can you even auto buy things through
[3219.36 --> 3220.00]  voice with Google?
[3220.08 --> 3220.38]  Walmart.
[3220.56 --> 3221.28]  They have a partnership with
[3221.28 --> 3221.50]  Walmart.
[3222.18 --> 3222.28]  Oh.
[3224.78 --> 3225.14]  Ew.
[3225.14 --> 3227.46]  Well, I just like it's the same
[3227.46 --> 3229.12]  situation with Amazon where it's just
[3229.12 --> 3231.40]  some like giant massive company
[3231.40 --> 3232.28]  eating everything up.
[3232.92 --> 3234.96]  This is going to take more purchasing
[3234.96 --> 3236.80]  from other random companies.
[3237.04 --> 3237.52]  I don't know.
[3238.16 --> 3239.44]  Alibaba is coming soon.
[3240.10 --> 3240.30]  Yeah.
[3240.46 --> 3242.76]  That will be big here.
[3243.10 --> 3243.28]  Yeah.
[3243.40 --> 3245.38]  The usability of Alibaba is not there
[3245.38 --> 3246.40]  compared to Amazon.
[3247.34 --> 3248.72]  Google has its own Shop Express.
[3248.92 --> 3249.16]  Yeah.
[3249.30 --> 3250.24]  Come on, man.
[3250.94 --> 3252.14]  It's not there.
[3252.14 --> 3254.38]  I mean like on the same scale in
[3254.38 --> 3257.24]  terms of usability, trust.
[3257.70 --> 3259.40]  Like if something is a Prime product
[3259.40 --> 3263.36]  on Amazon, if it's shipped by Amazon
[3263.36 --> 3265.14]  and it's a Prime product, it's...
[3265.14 --> 3270.94]  It's higher likeliness that you're
[3270.94 --> 3272.00]  going to get it on time, that you're
[3272.00 --> 3273.76]  going to be able to have an easy time
[3273.76 --> 3277.04]  with returns and warranty and all that
[3277.04 --> 3277.58]  other kind of stuff.
[3277.68 --> 3278.38]  I don't know.
[3278.38 --> 3282.62]  It shelters you like most normal stores
[3282.62 --> 3284.58]  do and a lot of online situations
[3284.58 --> 3285.88]  don't do that properly.
[3286.96 --> 3288.48]  And their shipping sucks and stuff.
[3288.58 --> 3290.34]  Like I understand why Amazon's
[3290.34 --> 3292.20]  where they're at, but they need
[3292.20 --> 3293.14]  better competition.
[3294.30 --> 3294.90]  One more.
[3295.52 --> 3296.52]  Well, we got to do Flowplane,
[3296.62 --> 3298.44]  so let's do Flowplane and one more.
[3298.90 --> 3299.26]  I'm going to...
[3299.26 --> 3300.64]  I don't even know if I can screen share.
[3301.88 --> 3303.44]  Maybe you did the wrong guy.
[3303.68 --> 3303.92]  Yeah.
[3304.12 --> 3304.86]  I'm going to try that.
[3304.86 --> 3307.82]  You can find me in the club.
[3308.66 --> 3309.78]  We don't call it that anymore.
[3310.20 --> 3311.50]  It was Flowplane Club.
[3313.24 --> 3314.26]  Come on, man.
[3315.54 --> 3316.46]  Brows are full of bub.
[3317.44 --> 3318.48]  It's still not.
[3319.44 --> 3320.80]  I don't know if we're going to be able
[3320.80 --> 3321.66]  to show it.
[3324.60 --> 3327.56]  Well, either way, screen sharing is not
[3327.56 --> 3330.30]  happy right now, but Flowplane has a
[3330.30 --> 3332.48]  bunch of really cool stuff on it at the moment.
[3332.48 --> 3334.84]  There's even one thing that doesn't happen
[3334.84 --> 3335.18]  that much.
[3335.24 --> 3335.80]  There's a poll.
[3336.56 --> 3339.72]  There's a discussion poll asking you guys
[3339.72 --> 3344.06]  how you guys want us to share CES content
[3344.06 --> 3346.44]  on Flowplane because there's a few
[3346.44 --> 3347.60]  different options there.
[3347.78 --> 3349.02]  Usually we don't care what you think.
[3349.08 --> 3350.86]  It's still not working, so we will not be
[3350.86 --> 3351.48]  able to screen share.
[3352.34 --> 3354.44]  Oh, I bet you I know why it's not working
[3354.44 --> 3356.72]  and I could fix it if I had more time,
[3356.80 --> 3357.20]  but I don't.
[3357.30 --> 3357.64]  That's okay.
[3358.70 --> 3360.98]  Yeah, there's a poll asking how you guys
[3360.98 --> 3361.88]  want us to share content.
[3362.18 --> 3364.44]  Essentially, the decision was with something
[3364.44 --> 3367.18]  like YouTube, we have to time out our
[3367.18 --> 3369.34]  releases or YouTube's algorithm is going
[3369.34 --> 3371.30]  to be like, no, screw you guys.
[3371.68 --> 3373.72]  They're already going to do that a little
[3373.72 --> 3375.80]  bit because of just the nature of how
[3375.80 --> 3377.38]  rapid fire we have to do CES content,
[3377.66 --> 3379.14]  but we're going to do our best to spread it
[3379.14 --> 3381.46]  out and make the YouTube robot happy.
[3382.34 --> 3383.94]  But with Flowplane, whatever.
[3384.66 --> 3385.76]  It doesn't matter.
[3386.04 --> 3387.60]  We don't have to fight any weird algorithm.
[3387.60 --> 3387.68]  Awesome.
[3387.96 --> 3390.10]  So you guys have so far decided,
[3390.44 --> 3393.90]  post it in the main section and just fire it.
[3393.90 --> 3394.38]  Let her rip.
[3394.46 --> 3394.94]  Fire hose.
[3394.94 --> 3395.52]  Let her go.
[3395.88 --> 3397.28]  So right when it's ready, we're just going
[3397.28 --> 3397.92]  to post it up.
[3397.98 --> 3399.36]  You guys are going to get the content a
[3399.36 --> 3400.20]  little bit faster.
[3400.34 --> 3401.70]  It's not going to be the one week window
[3401.70 --> 3403.22]  that it normally is because that would be
[3403.22 --> 3405.42]  terrible, but it is going to be a little
[3405.42 --> 3406.56]  bit faster in general.
[3406.78 --> 3408.54]  We're going to get it up to you guys right
[3408.54 --> 3408.86]  away.
[3409.10 --> 3409.94]  It's going to be good.
[3410.12 --> 3411.86]  You can look like a Twitter magician.
[3412.64 --> 3412.80]  Yeah.
[3413.02 --> 3414.80]  You're going to be in the know hours ahead of
[3414.80 --> 3415.04]  other people.
[3415.04 --> 3415.28]  This video is coming.
[3416.16 --> 3417.12]  It's going to be awesome.
[3417.86 --> 3419.76]  On here, regardless, outside of the pool,
[3420.12 --> 3422.14]  there is a tech wiki for why is Windows
[3422.14 --> 3423.74]  display scaling so bad?
[3423.82 --> 3424.58]  I'm excited for that.
[3424.78 --> 3426.16]  I know a fair amount about it because I
[3426.16 --> 3431.00]  did the Surface Studio review, and there's
[3431.00 --> 3432.64]  a lot of really interesting information in
[3432.64 --> 3435.62]  that as to why the screen is the resolution
[3435.62 --> 3438.28]  and aspect ratio and stuff that it is.
[3438.30 --> 3440.08]  It seems to me like a topic that's like,
[3440.56 --> 3442.78]  yeah, it sucks, but it has to be this way.
[3443.00 --> 3443.34]  Yeah.
[3443.34 --> 3444.98]  You just haven't thought about it as hard as
[3444.98 --> 3445.38]  the engineers.
[3445.96 --> 3447.88]  It sucks for a reason.
[3448.52 --> 3451.68]  There's the OnePlus 5T review, now in white.
[3451.80 --> 3454.72]  If you haven't seen the ad for that, it's been
[3454.72 --> 3457.14]  everywhere, so I'd be surprised.
[3457.92 --> 3461.06]  There's a Flowplane exclusive behind the scene
[3461.06 --> 3463.64]  from right before Christmas that just got
[3463.64 --> 3465.72]  released, so I don't know why that got released
[3465.72 --> 3465.92]  now.
[3466.10 --> 3467.72]  But either way, it just came out.
[3467.72 --> 3468.58]  I will not spoil it.
[3468.58 --> 3469.38]  You guys got to see it.
[3469.52 --> 3471.50]  So the behind the scenes thing, I know some
[3471.50 --> 3473.98]  people are salty that we don't release this in
[3473.98 --> 3476.72]  other places, but YouTube would destroy our
[3476.72 --> 3478.82]  searchability if we did that because most people
[3478.82 --> 3479.76]  don't care about these things.
[3480.68 --> 3482.12]  I think they're awesome, and the people that do
[3482.12 --> 3483.58]  care about them are pretty hardcore about it.
[3483.64 --> 3488.08]  But anyways, there's the 13 GPUs in one PC
[3488.08 --> 3489.76]  Mining Adventure Part 2.
[3489.76 --> 3494.76]  This is a very large departure from the kind
[3495.46 --> 3498.04]  of amateur hour Mining Adventure Part 1.
[3498.38 --> 3499.62]  Just, you know, you know.
[3499.80 --> 3500.60]  There was some comments.
[3500.68 --> 3501.46]  They were accurate.
[3501.84 --> 3502.66]  We're just, you know what?
[3503.04 --> 3504.00]  But we're moving forward.
[3504.10 --> 3504.22]  Jake!
[3504.68 --> 3506.88]  Part 2, strong return.
[3507.24 --> 3511.10]  Part 3 is going to be even stronger of a return.
[3511.38 --> 3513.54]  So we're coming at you with some really interesting
[3513.54 --> 3514.70]  Mining Adventure videos.
[3514.94 --> 3515.44]  They're coming.
[3515.82 --> 3518.56]  PCI Express 4.0 as fast as possible.
[3518.56 --> 3521.38]  John, back at it again with the epic videos.
[3522.22 --> 3523.78]  An LTT handmade.
[3524.52 --> 3527.92]  There's an LTT video of a handmade portable arcade
[3527.92 --> 3531.12]  box, not an LTT handmade one.
[3531.32 --> 3531.52]  That's sweet.
[3531.52 --> 3533.46]  It's made by Carry42 as far as I know.
[3533.50 --> 3533.98]  Check it out.
[3534.40 --> 3535.34]  Super cool.
[3535.68 --> 3540.88]  And there's also some, like, extra footage from
[3540.88 --> 3543.10]  the Chiller Resurrection, which is super cool.
[3543.20 --> 3545.34]  So if you're into that, there's extra footage,
[3545.50 --> 3547.58]  the untold story of the Chiller Resurrection.
[3547.58 --> 3550.10]  Again, stuff that if we threw this on YouTube,
[3550.46 --> 3551.50]  people wouldn't care as much.
[3551.62 --> 3552.48]  It would hurt the channel.
[3552.66 --> 3554.56]  So we're just throwing it on Flowplane for the super
[3554.56 --> 3555.06]  hard course.
[3555.32 --> 3555.84]  And that's it.
[3555.98 --> 3556.40]  We're done.
[3556.62 --> 3557.28]  Moving on to the last topic.
[3557.28 --> 3559.40]  No, this weekend, there's going to be another
[3559.40 --> 3560.30]  keyboard video.
[3560.54 --> 3560.80]  Oh.
[3561.20 --> 3562.68]  A zany keyboard video.
[3563.54 --> 3565.96]  I think we almost did every one of them.
[3565.96 --> 3569.38]  But the zaniness is ending here.
[3571.14 --> 3571.42]  OK.
[3571.56 --> 3572.44]  We have another one in us?
[3572.74 --> 3573.28]  Yeah, I think so.
[3573.56 --> 3574.80]  How about this as a little simple guy?
[3574.90 --> 3575.22]  Yeah, sure.
[3575.34 --> 3575.92]  Let's just do that.
[3576.24 --> 3579.34]  Unsurprisingly, if you think about it, 2017 was the
[3579.34 --> 3581.40]  biggest year ever for electric car sales.
[3581.44 --> 3581.70]  Wow.
[3581.74 --> 3582.82]  I'm super surprised.
[3583.26 --> 3583.62]  Actually.
[3584.18 --> 3584.98]  Tell me more.
[3585.42 --> 3588.46]  There was a time in the 30s?
[3588.46 --> 3588.74]  Yes.
[3588.90 --> 3591.02]  Like before the Model T where electric cars actually
[3591.02 --> 3593.78]  were the main, had the most market share above
[3593.78 --> 3594.46]  combustion engines.
[3594.58 --> 3596.66]  But since then, this is the biggest year ever.
[3596.84 --> 3598.18]  Someone asked about the dust video.
[3599.12 --> 3600.34]  I'm going to just say this right now.
[3600.88 --> 3602.00]  The dust video is going to happen.
[3602.80 --> 3603.60]  I'm going to be in it.
[3603.84 --> 3604.78]  Linus is going to be in it.
[3604.98 --> 3606.56]  There's possibly other people that will be in it.
[3606.56 --> 3607.38]  Is this a Counter-Strike thing?
[3607.38 --> 3607.56]  Possibly not.
[3608.48 --> 3609.42]  I don't even know what this is.
[3609.60 --> 3610.28]  Oh, that's pretty.
[3610.60 --> 3612.10]  I understand where you're going with that.
[3612.20 --> 3614.64]  But no, it's the dust computers that are up in the corner.
[3615.24 --> 3616.34]  I'm not going to be in it, guys.
[3618.10 --> 3621.54]  You should just walk through the screen at some point.
[3621.88 --> 3622.16]  Hey.
[3623.08 --> 3624.52]  Yeah, it is going to happen.
[3624.66 --> 3625.52]  We haven't filmed it yet.
[3626.32 --> 3629.02]  It means it's not going to be filmed until at least after CES.
[3629.02 --> 3631.12]  So it's going to be at least another week until it's filmed.
[3631.44 --> 3632.60]  But it's going to happen eventually.
[3633.44 --> 3633.74]  Anyways.
[3633.92 --> 3635.12]  Let me chuck some numbers at you here.
[3635.64 --> 3635.78]  Yeah.
[3635.78 --> 3643.40]  December marks the 27th month of consecutive sales gains for plug-in vehicles, meaning EVs.
[3643.80 --> 3649.40]  So in 2017, there was nearly 200,000 EVs sold in the U.S., 199,826.
[3649.64 --> 3655.60]  This compares to 158,614.
[3656.00 --> 3656.76]  So what is that?
[3656.82 --> 3657.96]  Like a 30% increase?
[3658.12 --> 3658.66]  Pretty decent.
[3659.36 --> 3662.02]  So if you break that down by the top five brands that were sold,
[3662.02 --> 3667.16]  the Tesla Model S was the number one seller at 27,060.
[3667.50 --> 3669.68]  Next in line, Chevy Bolt.
[3670.74 --> 3675.52]  Chevy Bolt, the electric version, at 23,297.
[3675.84 --> 3677.12]  Next in line, back to Tesla.
[3677.22 --> 3680.12]  It was the Model X, over 21,000 of those sold.
[3680.66 --> 3681.90]  And then, what was that?
[3681.90 --> 3684.26]  I just read the last bullet point.
[3684.36 --> 3684.76]  Sorry, keep going.
[3684.76 --> 3685.06]  Okay, okay.
[3685.22 --> 3686.98]  I thought you were like, Model X.
[3687.18 --> 3687.58]  No, no, no, no.
[3687.58 --> 3688.40]  That's so cool.
[3688.58 --> 3689.32]  I love that.
[3689.40 --> 3690.24]  I love the Model X.
[3690.98 --> 3691.60]  So the front.
[3692.96 --> 3694.84]  The fourth one was the Prius.
[3694.92 --> 3696.22]  Prius Prime from Toyota.
[3696.40 --> 3697.10]  Over 20,000.
[3697.14 --> 3698.38]  Almost 21,000 sold.
[3698.94 --> 3704.02]  And everyone wants to know how many Tesla Model 3s got delivered in 2017.
[3704.54 --> 3706.40]  And it looks like it was about 2,000.
[3707.44 --> 3708.08]  About 2,000.
[3708.20 --> 3709.88]  They're doing, what, 1,000 a week now?
[3710.62 --> 3715.30]  Which is less than a previous promise that they'd be doing 5,000 a week by the end of the year.
[3715.36 --> 3718.46]  They're now hoping to hit 5,000 a week by this summer.
[3718.46 --> 3725.48]  In terms of production estimations, that's pretty standard from what we've been able to expect so far.
[3725.94 --> 3727.00]  There's the estimation.
[3727.30 --> 3729.10]  They won't hit it, but they'll do pretty darn good.
[3730.26 --> 3731.90]  And that's cool because they'll figure it out eventually.
[3732.74 --> 3733.12]  There you go.
[3734.02 --> 3742.50]  Someone said in chat, Streamlabs is releasing their own kind of version of OBS because OBS is open source.
[3742.60 --> 3743.20]  That is a thing.
[3743.54 --> 3745.94]  I'm going to be screwing with that on my personal stream.
[3746.30 --> 3747.70]  I believe Colton is as well.
[3747.70 --> 3749.20]  But I don't know if I'll end up using it.
[3749.28 --> 3749.64]  We'll see.
[3750.14 --> 3758.14]  That's another interesting news bit, though, because if you're into streaming, it streamlines a lot of different stuff, which is cool.
[3758.74 --> 3761.94]  And I think we will see you guys.
[3762.36 --> 3763.14]  At CES.
[3763.14 --> 3763.94]  At CES.
[3764.02 --> 3767.32]  We have so far never missed a WAN show at CES.
[3767.52 --> 3771.10]  So theoretically, there will be a WAN show at CES.
[3771.24 --> 3773.28]  But every single year, it's super random.
[3773.28 --> 3775.32]  How it works is super random.
[3775.32 --> 3776.58]  Who's on it is super random.
[3776.58 --> 3778.58]  Where we are is super random.
[3778.58 --> 3780.62]  What time it starts.
[3780.62 --> 3783.92]  Not that that's different from normal, but it's pretty random.
[3783.92 --> 3786.08]  It would be pretty cool if we did it from a plane.
[3787.22 --> 3788.54]  Like, if we have Wi-Fi on the plane.
[3789.34 --> 3789.98]  That'd be dope.
[3789.98 --> 3796.04]  You might even be able to get by with a super crappo resolution.
[3796.04 --> 3799.04]  If we get everyone else on the plane to not use Wi-Fi.
[3799.04 --> 3801.82]  You might be able to get by with a super terrible resolution.
[3801.82 --> 3805.12]  If you think sitting beside a baby on a plane sucks.
[3805.12 --> 3808.70]  Wait until you're beside two podcasters.
[3808.70 --> 3811.58]  I think it would just get rejected from Twitch, though, because of the latency.
[3813.04 --> 3818.38]  Because, like, I connected to a game while I was on a plane just to check out my latency.
[3818.62 --> 3823.62]  And it was, like, quite a few seconds between input and what actually happened.
[3823.62 --> 3826.06]  Well, we can always do another pre-recorded one like this one was.
[3827.56 --> 3828.74]  Oh, fff.
[3828.84 --> 3829.22]  Why?
[3830.84 --> 3831.28]  No.
[3831.32 --> 3832.02]  I'm joking.
[3832.80 --> 3833.32]  I'm joking.
[3833.92 --> 3834.18]  Look.
[3834.32 --> 3834.72]  I can't.
[3834.88 --> 3836.70]  It says Friday, January 5th right there.
[3838.26 --> 3838.66]  Oh.
[3838.90 --> 3839.22]  JK.
[3839.86 --> 3840.26]  No.
[3841.04 --> 3841.64]  The joke.
[3841.82 --> 3842.68]  I gotta go, man.
[3844.82 --> 3845.26]  Anyways.
[3846.00 --> 3848.00]  I'll see you guys.
[3848.16 --> 3849.86]  CES Video, CES One Show next week.
[3849.96 --> 3850.34]  See you later.
[3850.62 --> 3850.94]  Goodbye.
