[0.00 → 5.74] about no well we're live now yeah if you want to ask me if we're talking about it then I guess
[5.74 → 10.74] we're pretty much talking about it no we're not no, no we're not oh what what what is it
[10.74 → 16.42] well I can't what no you can't, we're live now you can't tease me like that you can't be like
[16.42 → 19.70] hey are we gonna talk about and then just they're here it's embarrassing
[19.70 → 24.46] oh like that yeah I actually have no idea what you're talking about
[24.46 → 35.50] we're going to have a great show this week yeah um it might not be the wan show
[35.50 → 39.28] but like somewhere someone will have a great show
[39.28 → 49.34] I'm looking at the show on my laptop, and it looks so oversaturated
[49.34 → 57.10] the problem is that we're using a gaming monitor colour calibration that's our issue
[57.10 → 62.30] that's where we're running into trouble here so we've been so first makes so much
[62.30 → 68.46] first of all our camera people came in and cranked a black magic cinema camera to 1600 ISO
[68.46 → 74.38] so it basically in a properly lit room my shirt just looked like it looked like a bunch of like
[74.38 → 80.14] little bugs crawling around on my shirt um because of all the noise so much noise and then
[80.14 → 86.46] we tried to fix it ourselves which resulted in the visual feast in front of you today
[88.38 → 93.18] it's very saturated feast so that's that that's where we're at on this all right what do we what
[93.18 → 96.86] do we got for topics is there anything worth listening to or should people just tune out now
[96.86 → 101.74] uh no they should definitely stay tuned there 's's a couple of things that I think will be
[101.74 → 108.06] relatively interesting uh the first topic I don't think is that interesting um there 's's a LG
[108.06 → 112.46] giveaway that we can talk about yeah you can get some LG stuff that's cool actually you can get a
[112.46 → 118.70] whole gaming slash workstation machine should we just do that now sure okay um so last chance to
[118.70 → 124.22] enter the hive mind pc giveaway sponsored by LG the winner gets a pc with an estimated value of about
[124.22 → 131.58] two thousand dollars depending on which parts the audience chose as a whole oh so it's like a voting
[131.58 → 139.82] thing okay you also get a LG 38 we 95c monitor so it's a 38 inch 38 40 by 1600 ultra-wide so we're
[139.82 → 144.62] looking for ideas on how to spice up the build and the stream so I will be streaming the build of it
[144.62 → 152.06] live that's fun and then one lucky winner will get exactly that machine so uh it's worldwide with no
[152.06 → 158.14] age restriction how the heck are they doing that that doesn't what that doesn't sound uh like something
[158.14 → 163.50] that big companies with legal departments normally do so here's a link in the twitch chat to where you
[163.50 → 170.30] guys can uh go check out the gleam Io information about it including Quebec I guess which never
[170.30 → 180.14] happens entries close at midnight pacific tonight June 29th so don't miss it um what else we got uh g-sync HDR
[180.14 → 186.46] modules at 500 to the monitor price g-sync is expensive this and more breaking news yeah I think
[186.46 → 190.46] we already knew g-sync normal modules were 300 bucks so the fact the price went up should not be
[190.46 → 197.82] astounding um great news uh YouTube experiments with custom thumbnails just coming in
[197.82 → 204.06] saving the day thank you again YouTube thank you YouTube that was great I actually had a call
[204.06 → 211.58] with YouTube today and like out of respect for my partner manager I won't discuss any of the like
[211.58 → 219.10] specifics of my call because I am very appreciative that YouTube talks to me yeah because they are not
[219.10 → 223.98] always that communicative you'd be surprised if that's a relatively new thing yeah it's its it's
[223.98 → 232.94] amaze balls um but I will say that the tone of the call on my side was very grateful I'm grateful to YouTube
[232.94 → 241.58] and our Google overlords for making our job at float plane media easier so much easier um there's
[241.58 → 249.34] also rumours because you all know I love rumours of an i9 99 100k I almost wish they went just for full
[249.34 → 257.50] full gold and went i9 99 99k well it'll be over 9 000 that's fair um NVIDIA's new NDA requirement to
[257.50 → 262.78] get access to early hardware is this a giant scandal or is it a mountain being made out of a
[262.78 → 269.02] molehill not even a molehill more on this at 11. It's like one speck of dirt nope at 11. Okay
[269.58 → 277.34] uh nope that's it I'm rolling the intro 11. Did you see this I haven't actually, actually like exactly
[277.34 → 281.50] what I wanted to make remember I was telling you oh really it's literally it okay well we'll have to
[281.50 → 290.86] check that out then how do I get into the dashboard I use twitch so little and their settings menus are
[290.86 → 295.66] garbage where's the chat I love you twitch but your settings menus are I just want to chat oh right
[295.66 → 297.66] oh I forgot to whoop
[301.98 → 307.58] so Luke doesn't technically work here but yeah you're going to be at Ltd right yeah Luke will be at Ltd
[307.58 → 312.54] because Luke also technically does do things here sometimes yeah so you have a video coming soon I do
[312.54 → 319.42] like actually soon now and not just like me hosting a video and like pulling Luke into it for like colour
[319.42 → 326.54] commentary like Luke is hosting uh the Nintendo lab video the latest possible no one cares anymore
[326.54 → 332.94] about it, but these are the reasons why people should have cared Nintendo lab video that's quite a sales
[332.94 → 340.14] pitch all right so what basically the whole internet is wrong about lab and Nintendo now you're getting
[340.14 → 346.46] back into the clickbait spirit I knew you had it in you yeah um so let's jump into our first topic this was posted by
[346.46 → 357.66] thanatology um the study of people named wan I guess thanatology over on the forum uh the original article here is
[357.66 → 366.38] from tech power up NVIDIA's g-sync HDR module is this was just working
[366.38 → 376.54] i you saw me test this I actually didn't but I believe you no i no you've got it on Luke's
[376.54 → 381.98] I know, but that's the one okay that was there we go all right okay did you try unplugging it and
[381.98 → 388.30] plugging it back in yes, yes I have oh, oh no never mind yeah okay you're right thanks bye okay like
[388.30 → 395.82] half of my calls to tech support ever really uh it's happened maybe not half I don't call tech support
[395.82 → 401.66] that much that's fair um but if we're going back to like when I would call tech support as a teenager
[401.66 → 409.42] if we're talking about ever I have definitely made my fair share of have you tried I must have told you
[409.42 → 415.26] my VGA call story right okay you know what we're going to get back to this g-sync HDR module have I told
[415.26 → 420.38] you that one before with the mineral computer I'm not actually sure I don't think so we'll get through
[420.38 → 424.22] part way and I'm sure there's people here that haven't heard it you'll probably remember because i I must
[424.22 → 429.82] have told you at some point the only time I've ever contacted customer support from any computer
[429.82 → 435.58] hardware company ever was VGA and one time I've never had to outside that everything's always
[435.58 → 441.02] worked, or it's been like clearly my fault because my hand was covered in oil and I dropped a hard drive
[441.02 → 447.18] that is not max store that was the brand of the hard drive's fault because i it hit the ground it's my
[447.18 → 451.90] fault anyway took it and threw it on yeah pretty much you know where that's going I was everyone knows
[451.90 → 455.90] about my mineral computer if you don't uh there's there are videos of it on the channel you should
[455.90 → 461.98] check it out it's its actually a hilarious video in the end but yeah when I was building it
[461.98 → 466.78] uh I'm like 12 hours into this build, and it's taken me forever it's the first time I've ever built a
[466.78 → 471.26] mineral computer I'm doing a lot of things for the first time it's actually only it's probably like the
[471.26 → 475.66] low double digits of times I've built a computer at all at this point right and I'm trying to build a
[475.66 → 482.30] mineral oil one um I go through a lot of hardships including realizing that due to the fish rocks that
[482.30 → 486.54] I put in the bottom of the fish tank my power supply would no longer fit because I did all the
[486.54 → 492.62] sizing based on no fish rocks being there, and it was like really hard to clear a spot for it blah blah
[492.62 → 499.50] blah blah so I unscrewed the casing on the power supply figured out that it was like a wrapped setup so
[499.50 → 503.66] it was screwed on one side, but it wasn't like two completely separate metal panels
[503.66 → 511.18] so I had to like to tear off the metal that was there and I ended up only having like little
[511.74 → 516.78] like wire cutters so i I was able to just get a tiny little snippet and then I had to literally
[516.78 → 523.50] rip the metal in half I think you might be the king of wrong tools anyway I got it is that's why there's
[523.50 → 529.42] like a jagged edge on one part of that power Luke needs a condom which you know goes to the dollar
[529.42 → 537.74] store finds a balloon, and it's like well this end looks big enough surely the other one will stretch
[540.14 → 541.34] oh my god um
[543.50 → 548.78] but i I get the power supply ripped, and it fits now, and that power supply still works actually I've used
[548.78 → 553.58] it recently which is hilarious um it's actually pretty old I'm really surprised it still works yeah
[553.58 → 558.30] uh every everything fits I get all the oil in and I've turned I turned it on I did the old thing
[558.30 → 563.42] you turn the computer on before you put it in the case which is good yeah I did that, and it worked
[563.42 → 569.26] fine then I submerged it pressed the power button nothing happened and I just freaked out because I'm
[569.26 → 572.94] a kid I don't have enough money to buy these components again right no one's going to give me
[572.94 → 578.30] a return on oil soaked components they sure it's not going to happen so I'm like try that sometime but
[578.30 → 583.58] your sorry carry on i I have no idea what's going on I'm freaking out it's really early in
[583.58 → 589.82] the morning for whatever I have an VGA motherboard for whatever reason I was like I'm going to call VGA
[589.82 → 595.42] tech support I don't know why I picked that component yeah because it could have been anything that was
[595.42 → 601.98] I have no idea yeah I just was like I need to call someone and the dude on the phone was like really
[601.98 → 610.54] calm and really patient I felt like I was calling 911 um hello computer enthusiast please state your
[610.54 → 616.54] emergency and I start trying to explain what's going on and like he finally eventually I don't
[616.54 → 622.62] know if he's heard of mineral cooling before at this point or not but uh he's like you know what
[622.62 → 627.90] what I'm going to do I'm going to add a note to your account saying that like if we get any components in
[627.90 → 633.82] that have a little oil on if it's okay that was nuts he did that he actually did that and then
[633.82 → 640.30] he's like okay I want you to go through like taking it out and like reseeding some of the components for
[640.30 → 645.50] me, and he stayed on the freaking line the whole time and i I put him on speaker and I reseeded a
[645.50 → 650.94] bunch of components and I put everything back in, and it turned on and worked that was like
[650.94 → 655.66] the greatest customer support call I've ever had in my entire life, and it was basically did you try
[655.66 → 659.34] unplugging it and plugging it back in yeah that was where we were going with this thank you that
[659.34 → 666.62] only took about 10 minutes, but anyway that was just amazing that's that's i almost never have
[666.62 → 671.50] customer support calls, but that was really fantastic no one's come close since then
[672.14 → 681.34] all right so let's jump over to this g-sync news um basically uh pc PUR disassembled their kg swift pg
[681.34 → 687.74] 27 up because those guys have balls of steel it's a two thousand dollar monitor, and they found that the
[687.74 → 693.98] g-sync module is a newer version than the first generation g-sync monitors which I think we've known
[693.98 → 703.34] for like two years that new g-sync like faster g-sync was going to require a new module anyway the exact
[703.34 → 713.50] model of FPGA is an area anyway uh 10gx 480 which is a high performance 20 nanometre SOC that
[713.50 → 723.34] provides enough bandwidth and DVDs pins in order to process this huge 4k 144 hertz data stream it is sold
[723.34 → 732.62] in low quantities for two thousand dollars for the FPGA alone at dickey and mouser but assuming that NVIDIA
[732.62 → 739.34] buys thousands pc PUR is suggesting that the price of this chip alone will add 500 to the monitor's
[739.34 → 747.58] bomb cost it is further increased by the three gigabytes of ddr4 memory on the module and the
[747.58 → 754.46] added licensing fees for g-sync so if even just the three gigs like that stuff's expensive right now that
[754.46 → 762.54] stuff's really expensive right now so here's the bizarre thing about g-sync is that from
[762.54 → 769.26] the consumer standpoint I know a lot of people feel very strongly that NVIDIA should just adopt
[769.26 → 776.94] adaptive sync or free sync and just kind of get on board with the rest of the industry I mean they are
[776.94 → 784.54] now up against more than just AMD like it used to be NVIDIA versus AMD g-sync free sync and AMD had a
[784.54 → 791.10] handful of partners that were rushing free sync monitors to market um but now NVIDIA is up
[791.10 → 798.06] against a much larger tide in the industry as a whole Samsung is going to be supporting free sync
[798.06 → 805.90] on upcoming TVs that to me is huge you combine that with the free sync support on the Xbox
[806.54 → 812.22] and now it's like whoa whoa whoa now hold on just a gosh darn minute whether you have a pc or
[812.22 → 818.70] whether you have a console yeah if you want a game on a monitor or on a TV if you want all of those
[818.70 → 825.98] things and the ability to interconnect all of them free sync is the only solution on the market today
[827.66 → 833.10] it's probably going to stay that way and a lot of people are assuming that the only reason that NVIDIA
[833.10 → 838.46] would not adopt the industry standard solution is in order to make more money on their licensing
[838.46 → 846.78] but I'm kind of looking at this going like hold on a minute if there wasn't more to it than that
[847.42 → 853.34] why would NVIDIA pay somewhere in the neighbourhood of 500 for these modules
[854.78 → 862.62] why would they why would they hurt the competitiveness of g-sync monitors available on the market
[862.62 → 869.42] if they didn't have to, and then you go back again, and you go now okay well hold on a second
[869.42 → 879.82] here g-sync on notebooks doesn't have this FPGA so they found a way to do it with the embedded display
[879.82 → 887.50] port connection but not with the standard you know I think we haven't really done a guest in a long time
[887.50 → 897.02] I think this news merits asking tom Peterson from NVIDIA to come on the show and explain why
[897.66 → 905.82] the actual ball sack they would spend all this money and lock variable refresh rate down to this
[906.46 → 907.82] proprietary solution
[910.30 → 917.26] if there isn't a compelling of their own products yeah because imagine that
[917.26 → 927.26] your NVIDIA talking to LG or TCL or Samsung you're talking to a major like panel and television
[927.26 → 936.22] manufacturer, and you're going to have I got a deal for you, we're going to have you take your existing scaler
[936.94 → 943.90] I know it's cheap, but you know you're going to throw that away okay you're going to take our scaler which
[943.90 → 949.42] doesn't have all these fancy component inputs that people might need for their legacy devices
[949.98 → 959.34] it doesn't take six HDMI in its pretty basic we want you to spend 500 on it sound good
[960.62 → 965.50] why would they do that if they don't have to and then why would they go and put a bunch of ram on it
[965.50 → 973.58] if they don't have to is there okay so I've used free sync and aside from some of the
[973.58 → 978.86] the limitations of the early monitors where the free sync range was not very helpful like it didn't
[978.86 → 986.62] go down low enough I don't personally notice a huge difference like is this the kind of thing where i
[986.62 → 990.86] have to pull out a phantom camera in order to see the difference in the way the monitors are
[990.86 → 996.14] refreshing is that something we should do we should talk to tom though okay if that's something
[996.14 → 1004.86] we should do then sure, but we could get what we should do from him okay all right I think
[1004.86 → 1014.22] giving tom a chance I'm going to email him right now uh no, no I'm emailing him right now can you guys
[1014.22 → 1021.82] come on our show and explain g-sync this is all in the subject line got a lot of our viewers I mean
[1021.82 → 1026.38] really this is me asking you guys don't seem that concerned got a lot of our viewers wondering
[1027.50 → 1035.26] why it needs uh two thousand dollar FPGA and three gigs of ram he's legitimately doing this
[1035.26 → 1042.94] right now Linus you know let's throw chat seems to be asking for it right now thanks Linus um okay
[1042.94 → 1049.58] Linus yeah formal yeah you know what I'll throw in the thanks every once in a while I'll throw in the
[1049.58 → 1054.46] thanks it was still basically a one-liner yeah, but it's got a thanks you know tom-tom's Tom's
[1054.46 → 1059.50] I respect tom a lot by the way Tom's great super cool so is the other person including the email
[1059.50 → 1065.34] yeah, yeah so if anyone can explain this to me, I think our PR contact gets upset when I go straight
[1065.34 → 1070.62] to tom because Tom is not technically PR or marketing or anything he's not technically like
[1070.62 → 1074.62] an outward facing position he's perfect at it yeah he's like awesome yeah so it's you know i
[1074.62 → 1081.02] I really want to talk to tom about it because he can put something like we are spending 500
[1081.58 → 1087.02] for loss into a perspective that might make sense yeah because if there's anything I know about NVIDIA
[1087.02 → 1089.18] it's that they don't spend money unnecessarily
[1093.26 → 1099.50] all right let's jump into our next topic here uh this was posted by rubber puppy on the forum
[1099.50 → 1105.90] rubber and I'd like to open this with a statement from the current coo of float plane media
[1107.02 → 1117.26] does float plane media now or intend in the future to alter or um disfigure in any way the thumbnail
[1117.26 → 1125.18] that a creator would upload to the platform for their viewers' no uh not only does that seem uh
[1125.18 → 1131.18] uh I'm trying to be PR happy right here not only does that seem stupid just drop the PR happiness
[1131.18 → 1137.90] uh that's not PR but that literally just sounds like unnecessary work, and we have a lot of other
[1137.90 → 1147.66] stuff to do so let's just let's jump over to my screen not only do I not get the point, but it sounds like a
[1147.66 → 1155.10] bunch of work here's the post from rail a large song Garcia oh wow I'm not even
[1155.10 → 1161.50] you know forget that I ever tried um hello team YouTube I would like to know why are
[1161.50 → 1168.06] not the thumbnails of the videos on my channel what happens is that all my videos had thumbnails and now
[1168.06 → 1178.14] they are no longer seen what a tremendous concern to have um this is good so to YouTube's credit
[1178.14 → 1184.62] now going back to going back to being appreciative of YouTube for a minute here to YouTube's credit they replied
[1184.62 → 1189.66] yeah, thank you team YouTube that's actually surprising good job I'm not a super huge fan of
[1189.66 → 1196.06] their reply we are running a small experiment where 0.3 percent of viewers will see an auto-generated
[1196.06 → 1202.86] thumbnail instead of your custom thumbnail okay we're not removing the ability to create your custom
[1202.86 → 1209.66] thumbnail we're just not going to show it to some people we're doing this to gain insight on auto-generated
[1209.66 → 1216.70] thumbnails for the future something to consider too is 0.3 sounds automatically like oh absolutely
[1216.70 → 1222.94] tiny amount of people, but it's freaking YouTube so 0.3 is actually I have no idea but I'm assuming in the
[1222.94 → 1229.58] millions of people this is actually a lot of people it's not a lot in comparison to the entire whole of
[1229.58 → 1232.30] people that use YouTube, but it's a lot of people
[1236.46 → 1242.62] there's someone with like a research degree that's going after them super ham for not doing this
[1242.62 → 1247.74] properly there are the comments on this twitter thread are glorious I heard back from NVIDIA already
[1247.74 → 1252.54] they're saying it doesn't cost two thousand dollars so that's good we've we've confirmed now that they
[1252.54 → 1259.34] are indeed getting a volume discount which we assumed before um but uh I don't have any information
[1259.34 → 1265.66] other than that yeah we knew that so I'm just i've replied uh saying well okay yes but uh
[1265.66 → 1271.34] we like we still want to know yeah so just come talk to us about g-sync dude yeah they don't even
[1271.34 → 1276.14] necessarily have to be that they should be happy anytime tom gets in front of people they like love
[1276.14 → 1280.78] NVIDIA more so they shouldn't yeah they shouldn't be afraid to put just come, come flex your tech and we
[1280.78 → 1284.70] can that can be like part of it, but we can talk about more things all right so there's so there's
[1284.70 → 1291.82] a couple of things here number one I personally am of the mind that 0.3 percent is not that big of a
[1291.82 → 1296.70] deal even in the context of a channel that gets two million views a day which is where we're kind
[1296.70 → 1300.70] of sitting these days we're a little low right now so hold on per channel yeah but I mean users
[1300.70 → 1308.06] two million times point and that's not I don't I don't actually think views is the right way to do it
[1308.06 → 1313.66] okay they could be whale users but if it's no, no no not a random distribution not even that because
[1313.66 → 1318.22] you're looking at people who it's going to come down to a choice decision and with how YouTube's
[1318.22 → 1321.58] algorithm works right now if they don't click on your video it might not come back
[1322.86 → 1328.38] so you could be getting cut 0.3 of your users okay because now they're not clicking on it because
[1328.38 → 1333.90] it looks weird, so the impact could be hurt yeah okay so that would be 60 000 views a day
[1333.90 → 1339.02] it could potentially hit us for assuming that it's just a one-time one-time thing which is
[1339.02 → 1345.58] honestly not the end of the world but 60 000 people a day that might not see your video in sub boxes anymore
[1346.54 → 1354.78] I'm over it but I have deeper concerns I have other concerns my other concerns are to do with
[1355.90 → 1362.70] why are they doing research into auto-generated thumbnails if there isn't some kind of purpose to
[1362.70 → 1369.02] the experiment and the only purpose that I can think of to an experiment that goes hey what would
[1369.02 → 1374.46] happen if we just used auto-generated thumbnails instead of user-created thumbnails is that they
[1374.46 → 1380.94] are considering using them yeah that's the only reason to run this experiment that makes sense to my
[1380.94 → 1387.10] non-ai algorithmic brain and so question for you, I'm gonna almost flip sides a little bit here yeah
[1388.14 → 1392.54] would that be that bad right now we have clickbait cancer all of our thumbnails I'm leaving that
[1392.54 → 1397.26] up to the audience so I've actually brought up our dashboard here and I'm going to screen share with
[1397.26 → 1404.22] you guys let's go ahead and pop up my screen here all right so this video right here went up today
[1405.42 → 1410.70] high school for gamers uh actually this is not our original thumbnail design for it is originally had me
[1410.70 → 1416.06] holding up a legitimate e-sports textbook which was hilarious by the way look e-sports textbook amazing
[1416.86 → 1420.78] so we've got a few different options here we've got to actually do you want to do you want a straw
[1420.78 → 1425.58] pull create a straw pull, and we just need a couple options do you prefer our custom one or do you
[1425.58 → 1431.90] prefer one of the auto-generated thumbnails, so this is high school for gamers we've got me standing
[1431.90 → 1436.94] holding a book in front of a plant we've got me standing in sort of dark room it's hard to see my
[1436.94 → 1441.82] face, and then we've got me standing outside a building, and then we've got sort of bigger me with
[1441.82 → 1446.38] people gaming behind me okay, so there's example number one we're gonna we're going to do a few we're
[1446.38 → 1449.90] going to do a few here uh here let's try this one
[1453.74 → 1459.58] this laptop does everything sort of we've got me holding up laptops we've got some people sitting
[1459.58 → 1466.22] around eating what is presumably cake we've got some people sitting at a table, and we've got actually me
[1466.22 → 1472.94] holding laptops okay all right but I'm not gonna I'm not going to lead you guys too much I want you guys to
[1472.94 → 1477.58] to conclude for me uh let's try to dual CPU sockets matter
[1479.90 → 1484.30] this video didn't perform very well so maybe we would have been better off you know I actually don't
[1484.30 → 1493.34] mind this one hmm okay what I mean this one do you think do you think the top one that does suck that's
[1493.34 → 1498.14] like yeah that does suck uh do you think the top one is the one that it would pick though I don't
[1498.14 → 1503.98] know it might just be one of it might be like random um okay let's try why do we need so many
[1503.98 → 1513.26] servers okay this one wow we would have thought it was a tech linked episode with Riley with that one
[1513.26 → 1518.30] so that would have been terrible yeah that's not great uh this is just me in kind of dark mess
[1518.30 → 1524.22] hard to tell anything this is just me in the editing den it's hard to tell like having a picture
[1524.22 → 1529.26] of the server does seem pretty helpful for this one is there any other examples you want to you
[1529.26 → 1534.06] want to see is anything people in chat are saying that they pick the middle thumbnail and other
[1534.06 → 1538.14] people are just kept on saying that it picks the second one or the second one is the best blah blah
[1538.14 → 1544.06] blah interesting okay all right why is everyone buying this monitor okay let's try this one sorry
[1544.06 → 1549.82] you guys I know this is taking a little while but this is live research okay so it managed to grab
[1549.82 → 1555.98] our end card so that's not helpful for sure it managed to grab me standing in the kitchen I am
[1555.98 → 1560.78] looking at a monitor though again the second one's okay though but the second one is okay it's me
[1560.78 → 1566.54] sitting there with a monitor in front of me uh do you have those straw poll results yeah um where will
[1566.54 → 1571.34] i how will I get them spamming them in chat so if you just go to chat okay cool I'm going to go I'm
[1571.34 → 1576.54] going to go check out chat I'm going to go grab that and bring it up bam oh I missed all right click dick
[1576.54 → 1581.98] dang it I found actually one of the better ways to do it is to put your mouse where it will be and
[1581.98 → 1586.94] then wait for chat to bump it and then click there I've actually I've actually found that that works bad
[1586.94 → 1594.86] solutions for stupid problems okay so even though we did see some pretty good examples in there of
[1594.86 → 1602.70] thumbnails that actually looked not bad 80 of you are saying that you would prefer the custom creator
[1602.70 → 1607.58] thumbnails at least in our case and I know that there are some creators out there that are
[1607.58 → 1614.06] not doing a good job super abusing of uh in good faith creating a thumbnail that is representative
[1614.06 → 1621.98] of the content yeah um but still an 80 to 20 percent vote here is a pretty overwhelming majority
[1621.98 → 1628.06] that looks pretty clear to me that you guys have you guys have spoken someone in chat 80 of chat has bad taste
[1628.06 → 1634.62] well moving on then
[1637.02 → 1641.74] actually we should get our uh we should get our sponsors out of the way yeah um I believe one of
[1641.74 → 1656.38] them is Ltd 2018 oh boy Ltd is the oh that's weird wah Ltd is the interactive meetup and oops meetup and
[1656.38 → 1661.74] interactive tech event it'll be on July 14th at the Richmond Olympic oval here in Richmond British
[1661.74 → 1667.42] Columbia Canada current booths include a blind cable management competition brought to you by cable
[1667.42 → 1671.82] mod I want to do that I don't know I will take you on that's actually way more interesting a
[1671.82 → 1679.50] d-lidding workshop so bring your CPUs we will show you how to d-lid them case toss 2.0 now with more
[1679.50 → 1691.18] safety multi-headed VR a LAN 10k ultra-wide gaming which by the way is curved I thought it was 12k it
[1691.18 → 1701.34] was going to be 12k, but then we settled on um uh 3440 by uh 1440 ultra wides instead of the 4k ones okay
[1701.34 → 1709.10] and I will say that it is a better experience okay doing it this way okay the extra pixels were
[1709.10 → 1713.90] not contributing much, and the extra size probably would have been unnecessary because it already
[1714.54 → 1720.62] takes up a ginormous significant port have you seen it no it's actually built oh it will be there
[1720.62 → 1725.90] like it's confirmed now before we were just kind of hoping corsair Asus vertigo cable mod BS mods
[1725.90 → 1730.54] free geek alpha cool and I buy power will all be at the event with a ton of more brands sending swag
[1730.54 → 1737.98] and to give you guys some idea of the swag NVIDIA has sent six titan x's six 1080 tis and a whole
[1737.98 → 1742.70] bunch of other stuff so we're actually thinking they won't sponsor us, but they'll give us stuff to
[1742.70 → 1748.54] give away that's actually that's pretty cool sure I mean they make Ltd pretty sweet yeah so far two
[1748.54 → 1753.10] years in a row so what we were thinking is instead of just doing a bunch of draws on the stage because
[1753.10 → 1758.06] that kind of took forever and was kind of tedious it did we're going to make so many things there like
[1758.06 → 1764.06] competitions cool so like the blind cable management thing you might win a titan so we want to drive
[1764.06 → 1768.94] participation so yeah that's come hang out ticket start at 35 Canadian, and you can check them out at
[1768.94 → 1776.22] the link below or Ltd expo.com there's also going to be custom merch that you can't get other places' oh
[1776.22 → 1781.42] there's also going to be custom merch apparently that you won't be able to get other than at Ltd I want
[1781.42 → 1787.74] so wow that's kind of a dick move so the customers that you actually can't get anywhere else is Ltd merch
[1787.74 → 1794.62] oh it's a Ltd but also oh we have lanyards too right yeah we have lanyards cool and then there's also
[1794.62 → 1801.10] one design that our guy has created that is going to be on sale later, but you can't get it anywhere else
[1801.10 → 1806.22] and it's really cool, and it's going to be cheaper oh it'll be cheaper at Ltd okay cool and like more
[1806.22 → 1811.90] colour varieties and stuff all right yeah also sponsoring the show today private internet access
[1812.54 → 1817.98] it supports a variety of VPN protocols protocols protocols and types of encryption and authentication

[1836.54 → 1841.82] we need a better vanity URL private internet.com pages slash Linus tech tips with dashes
[1843.34 → 1847.50] not possible oh all right so that won't be a thing maybe we should just create our own like
[1848.22 → 1851.82] genius link or something we could do line sec tips.com slash Pia
[1853.26 → 1857.26] I think I guess we could do that all right getting back into the news we actually have a
[1857.26 → 1861.74] a lot of topics oh what oh no we did that we did it right at the beginning yeah
[1863.34 → 1870.14] bye all right so we've got some rumours to talk about this was posted by numlock21 on the forum the
[1870.14 → 1877.02] original article is from CCF tech and I won't say that I know anything about this because I don't which
[1877.02 → 1882.06] is great because it means that I can just talk about the rumours that I've heard this is probably accurate
[1882.06 → 1892.14] yeah there's a rumoured core i9 coming to z390 um it's rumoured to be an eight core processor with 16
[1892.14 → 1898.54] threads which is absolutely killer because for me there's a fly by the way eight core was really the
[1898.54 → 1903.74] threshold that I bumped into um when video encoding mind you this was a while ago it might have improved
[1903.74 → 1910.06] since then when video encoding with uh GPU assistance in Adobe Premiere and adobe media encoder okay
[1910.06 → 1917.82] so if I had a really high speed eight core that also had an intel integrated GPU so I could use
[1917.82 → 1925.26] quick sync yeah that had the potential to be the best of all worlds so you're hoping and six cores
[1925.26 → 1933.50] wasn't quite enough so I am really hoping that this will be uh apparently they're oh branding it core i9
[1933.50 → 1938.54] that's wow why are they muddying the waters why didn't they just make high-end desktop core i9
[1938.54 → 1946.46] and mainstream core i7 tie like what are they doing um I'm excited for mainstream to be eight core I think
[1946.46 → 1952.30] that'll be a huge deal yeah once mainstream has been eight core for like three years that'll be
[1952.30 → 1958.14] perfect for software development and game development and stuff that'll be very nice i just
[1958.14 → 1966.70] my only thing with this is like of course I don't know well i I don't know they could have stuck with
[1966.70 → 1971.50] six cores I mean their six cores are actually reasonably competitive even with dozen 2. oh i
[1971.50 → 1977.58] don't necessarily mean about the 9900k to be fair oh I see what you mean yeah yeah yeah like uh intel is
[1977.58 → 1983.58] making more processors oh I see yeah the individual details if they're true that is
[1983.58 → 1990.54] interesting, but it's a rumour, so the rumour is that a core i7 9700k would be six core 12 thread direct
[1990.54 → 1997.50] replacement for the 8700k and the 9600k would be six core six thread so direct replacement for the 8600k
[1998.22 → 2003.82] what I would expect and this won't be popular is that because they are creating a new model number
[2003.82 → 2008.78] and they're giving it a core i9 designation I would expect this to be positioned as a more
[2008.78 → 2015.02] expensive option what we've seen over the last four or five generations now going from 2600k to 3770k
[2015.02 → 2029.26] to 4770k to 4790k to 5775c that was short-lived to 6700k to 7700k is every generation intel has
[2029.26 → 2035.42] bumped the performance by five to ten percent, and they've uh put a few bucks on the price how much
[2035.42 → 2039.18] how much do you think it'll cost but basically not much more than adjusting for inflation
[2039.90 → 2044.78] I think this time we are going to see the top tier skew on the mainstream platform cost a significant
[2044.78 → 2050.78] amount more I wouldn't be surprised if instead of with dozen oh yeah barking at their tails I think so
[2050.78 → 2056.38] I don't think that from intel's perspective dozen challenges the mainstream k chips
[2056.38 → 2061.02] because their positioning of these chips is that they're for gamers even an i9 because those are
[2061.66 → 2069.82] crazy expensive yes and no the cheapest i's uh core i9 let's see what would be what like and it's oh
[2072.70 → 2081.98] 70 is there a 78 something k can't remember oh man this is a laptop chip why do I even why do i
[2081.98 → 2087.50] even bother going to intel's website when there's Wikipedia oh no okay yeah you're right core i9
[2087.50 → 2092.62] start at a thousand dollars that's that's like not really this one won't be like that though I think
[2092.62 → 2098.06] this one will be like a hundred dollars more okay so from because that's a pretty big shift for them
[2098.62 → 2103.18] yes it kind of actually makes sense, but it's a big shift yeah so I think this will be like a hundred
[2103.18 → 2108.86] dollars more and I think the justification will be that this is the fastest gaming chip, and it's also a
[2108.86 → 2115.90] really versatile uh sort of cheapo workstation chip because you will get to use the cheaper
[2115.90 → 2124.78] consumer chipset which does save you some money yeah all right NVIDIA's new NDA requirements for
[2124.78 → 2130.38] early hardware this is supposed to buy then immortal on the forum and the original article
[2130.38 → 2137.90] here was from tech power up um so basically I'm glad we used the tech power up article yeah um yeah
[2137.90 → 2144.62] because they are pretty much they went full editorial yeah we don't basically think that
[2145.26 → 2151.98] that is that big of a deal um it was a so this whole situation is very awkward yeah so German
[2151.98 → 2161.50] tech application heist.de I don't know if I said that right probably not um they felt that this latest
[2161.50 → 2167.82] update suggested to them that NVIDIA was mandating positive reviews in order to get access to
[2167.82 → 2173.34] hardware they weren't tech power up disagrees I disagree I actually hadn't gotten a copy because
[2173.90 → 2180.78] our video contact sent it to Luke who sat on it for weeks instead of hey okay the no I got a follow
[2180.78 → 2185.90] up a week after the deadline hey Linus is anyone from your organization going to sing this I never saw
[2185.90 → 2190.38] and then I got your forward after I had sent the sign one back to him already I know did you if you
[2190.38 → 2194.78] noticed from the forward it was not a reply to the original email oh I don't think I got the two
[2194.78 → 2200.14] week old email okay and that email was like a day or two old at that point so anyway it wasn't that
[2200.14 → 2207.10] bad I read through it actually as far as NDAs go it was pretty plain Jane it was like two pages
[2207.74 → 2213.58] didn't have anything terrifying in it like there's some NDAs out there that are scary like we're working
[2213.58 → 2217.82] on getting this unique graphics card that actually outputs over Ethernet
[2217.82 → 2222.22] uh yeah it's super cool their NDA really cool
[2224.78 → 2231.10] much bigger much bigger um NVIDIA's was actually for a company that size in particular
[2231.10 → 2235.02] like we've worked with some big multinationals in the past especially on like sponsored projects
[2235.02 → 2239.18] and theirs should explain why it's not that big of a deal because a lot of people read it and still
[2239.18 → 2242.78] thought it was terrible probably because they're just not used to reading legalese or NDAs
[2242.78 → 2249.66] well it's because the wording that says the recipient shall use confidential information
[2249.66 → 2258.46] solely for the benefit of NVIDIA means that while the product is NDA'd you are not supposed to be
[2259.26 → 2266.70] say for example taking this unreleased graphics card and lending it to your buddy over at AMD so that
[2266.70 → 2270.62] they can run benchmarks on it so that they'll know ahead of time what the performance will be
[2270.62 → 2277.58] when the NDA that's what that means when the NDA lifts the solely for the benefit of NVIDIA thing
[2277.58 → 2286.62] also lifts and besides the interpretation of solely for the benefit of NVIDIA could be very broadly
[2286.62 → 2292.94] interpreted like you could say that constructive criticism is for the benefit of NVIDIA that would
[2292.94 → 2300.46] be that would be that would be a fairly easy legal defence like it's not nearly as restrictive as
[2300.46 → 2306.94] it might be made out to be and like we know when NVIDIA does something wrong um like for
[2306.94 → 2312.62] example their uh GeForce partner program and uh I don't feel like we pulled any punches on that
[2312.62 → 2317.50] uh Luke has made his feelings on GeForce experience very abundantly clear over the years
[2318.06 → 2322.86] um which okay i actually I will take this opportunity to add for them, they've done a huge
[2322.86 → 2327.82] improvement oh I now use it when you no, no I don't use it either but this is that's the
[2327.82 → 2333.26] point I'm talking about you know how before if you did express install it would just install i
[2333.26 → 2337.42] actually did notice that yeah that's actually super cool yeah so it doesn't make you install
[2337.42 → 2341.58] it anymore yeah, thank you that's actually awesome I've hammered on them so much about GeForce
[2341.58 → 2346.94] experience so I have to give them the positive kudos at the same time about making it so that
[2346.94 → 2351.42] there's now when you go to the express stall it's like express with GeForce experience or express
[2351.42 → 2356.78] without I did notice that that's an absolutely totally acceptable good enough option we've got how
[2356.78 → 2362.14] about NVIDIA releasing 10 30s with ddr4 memory that's what you get for buying a 10 30?
[2363.74 → 2368.94] you don't buy low-end graphics cards we've made multiple videos about that here let's let's just
[2368.94 → 2374.38] low-end graphics card gamers nexus made a recent one about it to all you have to do all you have to do
[2374.38 → 2380.30] is google it let me google that for you technically YouTube is googled low-end video cards rent are they
[2380.30 → 2385.74] still terrible spoiler yes low-end video card rent and radon r7 240 unboxing and review spoilers
[2385.74 → 2395.34] yes um most gamers nexus's video and I think it's pretty new it's about the 10 30 or whatever
[2395.34 → 2402.54] dang it which is probably get your get your freaking SEO okay there you go gamers nexus
[2402.54 → 2407.90] disgrace of a graphics card GT 10 30 tdr4 is probably that video is probably why that person said that
[2407.90 → 2414.14] thing in twitch chat that is my assumption right, but that's what you get for buying a 10 30 instead of a
[2414.14 → 2422.06] last generation 900 series decent card as far as I know 10 30s are for like the person that walks
[2422.06 → 2426.70] into Best Buy needs to plug in more monitors and doesn't know any better because the cold hard
[2426.70 → 2434.38] truth and I've got I've had people just completely not listen so many times to mine and yours for that
[2434.38 → 2440.62] matter criticisms of low-end graphics cards saying well some people just don't have that much money to
[2440.62 → 2446.62] spend on a better one then buy used it's like the whole point of scrapyard wars
[2448.30 → 2453.58] a lot of people like we have had very good experiences with this if you bring your rig we'll
[2453.58 → 2459.50] let you test it just test it a lot of honestly a lot of the hardware community these dudes will
[2459.50 → 2465.50] even like let you into their house to where their computer is to test it there I'm not being some kind
[2465.50 → 2472.14] of you know elitist you know oh well then you should just spend more on your graphics card that's
[2472.14 → 2481.26] not the point no the point is that brand-new garbage is still garbage whereas used diamonds are still
[2481.26 → 2487.42] diamonds this might be a little slightly scratched up or something I'm I'm getting all mad and I shouldn't
[2487.42 → 2493.58] let myself get this stressed out about if it's just stupid uh someone asked when is scrapyard wars
[2493.58 → 2502.46] coming oh two weeks to float plane to float plane so it'll be a week after that um we had talked about
[2502.46 → 2508.06] float plane being more ready for prime time by the time scrapyard wars comes where are we at on that
[2508.06 → 2515.66] um there uh can I do a big push go sign up for float plane it's going to be amazing scrapyard wars I'm
[2515.66 → 2521.10] hoping you guys ready we have some cool things coming there's obviously been some uh minor shake
[2521.10 → 2524.78] up as you've heard of recently so we'll have to see how we react to that, but there is some cool
[2524.78 → 2530.54] things coming notifications are going to be working soon um some parts of it are already working oh we're
[2530.54 → 2535.18] not like launching that part yet until all of it's working okay uh discord integrations and stuff are
[2535.18 → 2540.54] going to be working soon there 's's some really cool things coming down the pipe uh okay if we can get
[2540.54 → 2544.78] it's done fast enough all right cool I'm excited you know what I should just I should just do it
[2545.66 → 2553.42] we are gonna we are going to pimp look at the look on his face so much concern it's frozen did it
[2553.42 → 2559.34] freeze why is it frozen why is it frozen there's the stream oh we're back baby all right yeah um okay
[2559.34 → 2566.78] no I was just messing with you uh Nevsky 802 I was like oh god dedicated video on the Ltd channel 20 000 new
[2566.78 → 2577.42] users overnight are you ready no uh the original article here is from tech crunch uh and this looks
[2577.42 → 2584.30] pretty cool VR gloves okay Luke go yes okay I've wanted this so bad Linus has been playing this game
[2584.30 → 2591.10] what is the game box vr I train boxing in real life two times a week and I have wanted to do
[2591.10 → 2595.66] this box VR thing but my biggest problem with it is that I don't want to hold the controllers
[2595.66 → 2600.78] yeah because I think that would be really weird I'm I've gotten very used to boxing with my
[2600.78 → 2604.86] boxing gloves on and uh I've been talking to I haven't had the time but I've been talking to him
[2604.86 → 2609.90] about how I want to get another pair of boxing gloves and mod the five controller into the boxing
[2609.90 → 2615.26] glove and now these guys have more or less done it for me, I'm sure I can take their design and attach
[2615.26 → 2622.46] to a boxing glove super easy very so that's awesome so uh in a nutshell um they're launching
[2622.46 → 2627.66] out of Y Combinator's latest class of startups with ambitions to bring a low-cost flexible glove
[2627.66 → 2632.78] into users hands or onto them as it were the plexus glove relies on the existing tracking systems of
[2632.78 → 2637.18] the HTC and oculus headsets, so the tracking sensors grab the position of where the hands are in space
[2637.18 → 2642.38] via the magnetically attached tracker magnetic that sounds bad uh yep I would just superglue it to
[2642.38 → 2647.58] the magnet I think yeah or better glue uh after calibrating arresting state of the user's fingers
[2647.58 → 2652.94] individual sensors communicate their position to the game engine very cool Velcro straps
[2652.94 → 2657.10] secure the glove at your palm and the individual finger controls hook onto the end of your fingertips
[2657.10 → 2662.30] with motors that offer tactile feedback see this creates a problem for modding into a boxing glove
[2662.30 → 2666.86] but I'll probably just ignore that part and just having gloves on and not having to wear
[2666.86 → 2671.26] or not having to hold the controllers will be good enough plexus is shipping the gloves with tool
[2671.26 → 2676.86] kits for unity and unreal game engines developer kits are 249 per pair ouch shipping in August
[2678.78 → 2684.22] yeah that's not cheap this is something that I've wanted for a long time believe it or not i
[2684.22 → 2688.30] didn't know that I wanted it to be a battle Royal and in fact I probably didn't want it to be a battle
[2688.30 → 2695.82] Royal but something that I have wanted for a long time is much, much greater scale multiplayer experiences
[2695.82 → 2701.26] uh something that I had sort of envisioned uh a number of years ago uh what's that uh what's that
[2701.26 → 2709.58] game ever play savage no so savage was uh let me make sure this is even the right name savage game
[2711.90 → 2713.82] savage battle for new earth was this it
[2713.82 → 2724.78] I think this was it so did I ever tell you about those lands I used to run at Vic yeah with like the
[2724.78 → 2728.94] huge amounts of computers across multiple computer labs on multiple floors all this kind of stuff we
[2728.94 → 2734.62] would play savage because this game supported some crazy amount of players I don't remember the exact
[2734.62 → 2741.90] amount of players that it supported, but we could have doesn't say labs versus labs going on oh the
[2741.90 → 2749.50] other one to 127 players on the team are field players yeah okay I actually didn't know this was an
[2749.50 → 2754.86] actual thing this is exactly what I wanted yeah, so this is an old game, but it's a very good like land
[2754.86 → 2760.70] pack you've got a huge amount of people for some reason you want to get everyone into the game and
[2760.70 → 2765.98] like it was always really fun because if I remember correctly this was like redstone was
[2765.98 → 2773.90] in this game so I had Redstone in my head I think it was called Redstone pre-minecraft and uh you'd
[2773.90 → 2779.50] have a whole lab you'd have like the leader of that team or the leader of that lab go like we
[2779.50 → 2784.30] need Redstone and then the whole lab is just like Redstone you see everyone in the game just run over
[2784.30 → 2789.42] to go get if it's so much fun, and you have to fight each other, and you like level up, and you spawn
[2789.42 → 2795.26] into different things, and it's like this whole combat RTS mix like one person each team is playing
[2795.26 → 2801.74] a RTS game right all the other players are playing like the minions it's its it's old it's very old
[2802.38 → 2811.66] interesting, but it's its fun so imagine that with like a thousand people yeah and yeah super cool so uh
[2811.66 → 2817.66] if anyone i I was really into supreme commander that's one of the games that I was most into out of
[2817.66 → 2823.10] any game like I think I was top 500 at one point which it wasn't a huge community but I was pretty
[2823.10 → 2833.02] good at it um imagine for a moment did you ever play subcom I did a little bit okay so it has large
[2833.02 → 2838.14] vehicles like I forget what they were called, but they were like tier four vehicles um that
[2838.14 → 2843.34] were like these huge things where you could potentially man something like that with like 20 or 30 people
[2843.34 → 2851.74] so imagine a 1000 player version of something like savage with just like kind of and the way that um
[2851.74 → 2858.70] subcom had a lot of really cheap swarm type units yeah so imagine a game like that with 500
[2858.70 → 2865.82] b 500 with like all these different roles so you could potentially run around as a marine, or you could be
[2865.82 → 2871.98] uh like a gunner on like this you know big land crawler tank thing or being a held with three dudes
[2871.98 → 2877.18] how much of a blast it was like local voice, and you like had to engage in local voice so if you're
[2877.18 → 2884.54] in that giant mammoth tank with 20 people you've got like the driver like telling what's coming up
[2884.54 → 2889.66] telling people to like reload different sides all this kind of stuff you actually have to use like
[2889.66 → 2895.34] your comm system to talk to anyone that isn't nearby like this sounds like a gaming experience that
[2895.34 → 2901.66] would probably be too hardcore for the Fortnite kids oh I'd love it though but I think it's the kind
[2901.66 → 2907.74] of thing that could be a completely different level of fun one thing i really enjoyed and
[2907.74 → 2912.22] I know you haven't played this game, but it's called it's called black wake um and I was really hoping
[2912.22 → 2917.98] this was what uh Microsoft's pirate game was going to be like, but it wasn't really but I don't even
[2917.98 → 2923.58] remember what Microsoft's power game is called at this point um but in black wake you drop into a new
[2923.58 → 2927.90] game, and you're on a're on a pirate ship you're sailing in the ocean, and you have to fight other
[2927.90 → 2934.22] people's pirate ships but your captain like it's your in first person view and you really
[2934.22 → 2937.98] can't see all that much if you're is you're the one doing things on deck right, and you have to like
[2937.98 → 2943.58] get the gunpowder and get the cannonball, and you have to shove the gunpowder in the thing and
[2943.58 → 2947.42] shove the cannonball in the thing and then load the cannon, and then you can aim it and fire it so
[2947.42 → 2952.46] like you can't look where the boat's going, so the captain has to sail the boat and then like bark out
[2952.46 → 2957.02] like I'm lining up for this side like port side and everyone's trying to reload the cannons on
[2957.02 → 2961.18] port side the captain has to yell out like there 's's a hole below deck so it has to run below
[2961.18 → 2966.38] deck and try to patch it and bail the water out and all is so planet side 2 free to play massively
[2966.38 → 2972.94] multiplayer first-person shooter um that has uh the Guinness world record for the biggest first
[2972.94 → 2979.18] person shooter battle with 1158 players being recorded in a single battle I don't, but this doesn't
[2979.18 → 2986.70] have the RTS element yeah I don't personally think it captures the same idea um, but it is i I've
[2986.70 → 2991.18] played a bit of planet side 2 if it is sort of like that but i yeah I don't think it quite captures
[2991.18 → 2996.14] the same idea right part of the reason for me is I believe planet side 2 is a persistent battle
[2997.50 → 3004.70] like forever z's it's not a match right uh I think you can win and lose areas it's a MMO yeah you can
[3004.70 → 3009.90] win and lose areas and like there will be a individual battle for an individual place and if one
[3009.90 → 3015.42] person wins or loses then it probably ends and whatnot, but it's not it's not the same type of thing
[3015.42 → 3021.34] all right let's see what else we've got for topics here oh right we didn't even talk about mavericks
[3021.34 → 3026.22] so mavericks promises right posted by crunchy dragon on the forum original article from pedestrian.tv
[3027.10 → 3030.54] earlier this year automation games revealed mavericks claiming its battle Royal mode can
[3030.54 → 3035.34] support up to 400 players crazier yet some game modes the studio says will facilitate up to a thousand
[3035.34 → 3041.98] concurrent players okay persistent environment means players will leave tracks wherever they go
[3041.98 → 3045.98] and you'll be able to drop in and out at any time the world will continue to exist and evolve
[3045.98 → 3051.66] whether you're there or not neat, and it'll be able to host up to a thousand players in any given server
[3052.86 → 3057.74] google's game streaming service may have a hardware component this was originally posted by
[3057.74 → 3061.42] master disaster on the forum the original article is from Kodak
[3061.42 → 3067.26] so basically game developers conference in March google representatives met with several big game
[3067.26 → 3072.38] companies to gauge interest in its streaming platform codename yeti and this is yet another
[3072.38 → 3080.22] indication that whether you like it or not cloud gaming is going to be a thing a lot of people were so mad
[3080.22 → 3085.02] when I did that video on what's NVIDIA's called again I know what you mean but yeah I don't remember off
[3085.02 → 3091.02] it's talking my head uh shield something what's what's it called no, no it's not called grid anymore
[3092.30 → 3102.38] uh NVIDIA oh crap it's its not called gate game no uh cloud gaming I can't remember what it's called
[3102.38 → 3109.02] g-force now um, so a lot of people were mad they were like they're going to have to pry my hardware from my cold dead fingers
[3109.02 → 3115.58] and you might be right but what's going to happen is cloud gaming is going to happen whether you like
[3115.58 → 3122.46] it or not and there's going to be much like um you know the Xbox has gaming experiences that are simply
[3122.46 → 3128.70] not available on the pc there's going to be gaming experiences that are available on cloud gaming that
[3128.70 → 3135.50] will not be available to those of you with graphics cards in your cold dead fingers and graphics cards in
[3135.50 → 3144.30] pc's are also not going away anytime soon just to be very clear but I can imagine a scenario where if
[3144.30 → 3151.34] every player was running off of the same data centre effectively you could actually enable massively
[3151.34 → 3158.38] multiplayer experiences more easily so the latency instead of being between the persistent environment
[3158.38 → 3164.22] and every individual player because you'd have effectively like zero latency within the data centre
[3164.22 → 3169.34] would be between every player and their own connection to the persistent world i actually
[3169.34 → 3176.54] foresee a way to create gaming experiences that otherwise wouldn't be possible yeah that's why it
[3176.54 → 3183.82] will exist and I hadn't actually thought of that until I said it just now but there's nothing you can do
[3183.82 → 3189.74] this is happening, and it also helps that massive companies like Google are jumping into the fray it's not
[3189.74 → 3195.34] just going to be NVIDIA playing by themselves with some smaller startups yeah uh I don't necessarily
[3195.34 → 3200.78] know if I like it or not but i I do think it's going to happen it might be i I feel like it would be cool
[3200.78 → 3207.74] if there was like some games you know how like wow has a subscription some MMOs have subscriptions you're
[3207.74 → 3212.86] going to pay for a subscription anyway whatever if it's a game that makes sense to have a subscription for
[3212.86 → 3217.90] yeah whatever but I see it coming to the point where it's like downloading games instead of buying
[3217.90 → 3222.38] physical copies where like people are like oh yeah it's just easier so I'm just going to do it anyway
[3222.38 → 3226.54] and then it bites people in the butt later when now they have download caps and games are 100 gigs
[3227.26 → 3232.06] um and other things start happening yeah not to mention that multiplayer just goes away once the
[3232.06 → 3236.30] game dev doesn't feel like it any more yeah like that kind of stuff uh so google took meetings at
[3236.30 → 3240.70] e3 in Los Angeles a few weeks ago apparently the company is looking not just to woo game developers
[3240.70 → 3245.18] to the yeti service but to buy development studios entirely oh that's interesting oh boy
[3245.18 → 3249.42] whispers have been quieter around Google's hardware whatever that might look like but the
[3249.42 → 3253.90] rumours suggest it will link up with the streaming service in some way it's not clear if they want to
[3253.90 → 3259.18] compete with the technical specs of like a new gen PlayStation or Xbox or whether it'll be cheaper
[3259.18 → 3267.82] and low-end relying on the streaming server servers to pull their weight dun dun don't google has apparently
[3267.82 → 3273.34] been on a massive hiring spree bringing experienced video game developers and marketers from Ea PlayStation
[3273.34 → 3279.42] and other top companies interesting uh this was posted by friendly non-murdering sort on the forum
[3281.74 → 3286.94] thank you for that this is super cool android messages for web now available for everyone the
[3286.94 → 3291.34] original article is from Google.com you can use your computer to chat with your friends through messages
[3291.34 → 3296.46] for web which shows what's on your messages mobile app it's about time messages got some attention hey
[3297.02 → 3301.82] like it didn't even have cloud sync until like it just started working for me very recently I was like
[3301.82 → 3306.06] oh holy crap my messages are still there when I switched phones how did this take so long and
[3306.06 → 3314.54] just so you guys know to get it yourself oh no this isn't even the right link uh where is it
[3314.54 → 3319.50] uh messages for web sends SMS messages using a connection from your computer to your phone so
[3319.50 → 3326.22] carrier fees will apply just like on the mobile app this is not like um iMessage okay it's not database
[3326.22 → 3333.18] still but once wow I keep forgetting what they're calling it once the new uh chat once chat rolls out
[3333.18 → 3339.34] I see no reason why it wouldn't be able to use data so if you go to messages.android.com it will give
[3339.34 → 3345.02] you the super easy instructions on how to sync it you just click on the triple dot thing in
[3345.02 → 3353.74] messages it'll bring up a like a QR code reader scan it you're done um and I've used it a fair amount
[3353.74 → 3359.18] already because I've been coordinating a stag and people that aren't on some other messaging system
[3359.18 → 3363.50] to be able to write out a massive message with my keyboard and then just copy and paste blop
[3364.38 → 3368.86] way easier you can pair it on multiple devices but only one will be active at a time
[3370.22 → 3377.66] um corsair is acquiring legato gaming this is posted by he coca on the forum I'm hoping that this
[3377.66 → 3383.34] situation is amazing because I've had a super intense frustration with them for a long time which is where
[3383.34 → 3388.78] they only support Windows 10 on their devices right so you want corsair to go and invest heavier into
[3389.34 → 3395.74] wider i I doubt it but good luck what about new devices though because of course if they make like
[3395.74 → 3403.90] stream deck 2 or like some new capture card, so my hope is actually less to do with capture and more to do
[3403.90 → 3411.98] with taking stream deck technology and putting it into keyboards, so corsair's gaming keyboards are already
[3411.98 → 3417.18] pretty cool but legato has clearly done a lot of work on remember the um the art Zebedee optimum
[3417.18 → 3421.58] keyboard from back in the day if you guys don't know what that is look it up yeah it's pretty cool
[3421.58 → 3426.22] individual display on every two thousand dollar keyboard or something um so I would love to
[3426.22 → 3432.78] see corsair take that technology and make it actually useful and corsair is pretty good at that
[3432.78 → 3437.74] make the keys more durable so that if you press on them, they don't like to ruin the screen below it and
[3437.74 → 3442.70] stuff like that stuff like that yeah that'd be really cool um even if they just did it as like
[3442.70 → 3450.06] a g key area yep I wouldn't even I wouldn't get your hopes up though I know what you want I know why
[3450.06 → 3454.38] you want it but like Windows 7 is like it's done man it's done it's not even that I use it's done one
[3454.38 → 3458.54] but Windows 7 is what I have to use for my sword for my argument because that's where the majority of
[3458.54 → 3463.66] users are, but someone found I should have been able to find this but i I didn't, but someone found
[3463.66 → 3469.98] that there is the like history log of versions and on one of the versions the only thing stopping at
[3469.98 → 3475.42] work from on Windows 7 8 and 8.1 is a flag that checks if you have the right operating system so
[3475.42 → 3480.94] someone made a wrapper that just ignores that flag, and you can just install it on whatever operating
[3480.94 → 3485.18] system you want, and it works completely fine it doesn't have like if I remember correctly it doesn't
[3485.18 → 3491.18] have like twitter video integration or something and I'm like wow I don't care right so yeah I'm
[3491.18 → 3495.34] just going to do that, and it'll work on my computer it's fine but last topic of the day you'll probably
[3495.34 → 3501.82] be excited or uh apprehensive this is off news.xbox.com, and it was posted by master disaster on the
[3501.82 → 3510.22] forum which is actually a great username uh halo TV series set to begin filming in 2019
[3510.22 → 3515.98] is it live action showtime president and CEO David Nevis has announced the network has ordered a 10
[3515.98 → 3522.14] episode season based on the halo game franchise kyle Killen awake will serve as executive producer
[3522.14 → 3527.42] writer and showrunner Rupert Wyatt rise of the planet of the apes will direct multiple episodes and also
[3527.42 → 3533.98] executive produced the hour-long series which enters production in early 2019 okay
[3533.98 → 3543.02] so it is not clear to me if it is live action or animated uh it's possible that some people know
[3543.02 → 3550.30] that I think the massive mistake was making the warcraft movie live action did you ever
[3550.30 → 3556.54] see it uh based on how terrible you told me it was I didn't bother okay yeah, but you played warcraft
[3556.54 → 3563.66] you saw the amazing cinematic I played warcraft like not two yeah and not three did you not play
[3563.66 → 3568.22] two and three I did play two and yeah okay I just mean I was just feeling kind of old because you
[3568.22 → 3571.10] were like you played warcraft and I was like yes
[3573.74 → 3579.66] yeah I did I I played it too to be fair I played it many many many years later just to see what it was
[3579.66 → 3586.22] about uh it's not very good no it's actually pretty really kind of bad yeah and the AI is like super, super
[3586.22 → 3594.54] brutal so bad but uh the cinematic in warcraft have always been amazing yeah and yeah uh world of
[3594.54 → 3600.94] warcraft cinematic same idea absolutely amazing cinematic yep, and then we get the movie, and it's
[3600.94 → 3607.58] live action like they have in my opinion possibly the best cinematic in gaming there's some argument
[3607.58 → 3613.34] there with square Unix stuff yeah square Unix has some really amazing stuff too in my opinion it's its
[3613.34 → 3618.30] close or better but it's hard to make that argument they're very different you have to go
[3618.30 → 3624.70] back very far and kind of compare era by era because they've both done in my opinion it's been them
[3624.70 → 3631.18] they've both done arguably a better job of cinematic than games at multiple points in their histories yeah
[3631.18 → 3636.78] sometimes it's not even arguably it's just like clearly that's way better um, and so they're probably
[3636.78 → 3642.38] kind of depends on which one going together the whole time blizzard has been incredible at
[3642.38 → 3648.86] cinematic, and then they make a live action movie and i just every single time that I see a warcraft
[3648.86 → 3655.98] or star craft or whatever to overwatch cinematic from blizzard I'm like holy crap this is gold
[3656.62 → 3661.10] everything about this is perfect, and then you see live action it's just what are you doing so i I hope
[3661.10 → 3667.02] halo is not live there's nothing here about whether it's live action or rendered uh on the xbox.com
