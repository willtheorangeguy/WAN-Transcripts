[0.88 --> 9.48]  Okay, here we go. We are live. This is Between Two Ferns, the Linus Tech Tips edition. I have Laser James with me here today.
[9.80 --> 21.28]  And we're going to talk about a whole bunch of different privacy news, including the whole Facebook thing with Mark the Zuck Zuckerberg, AMD Navi GPU being potentially amazing or not.
[21.38 --> 22.38]  It has nothing to do with privacy.
[22.74 --> 23.00]  No.
[23.00 --> 31.22]  And other non-privacy news, there could be a new successor to the Chromecast and competitor to Amazon Fire Stick.
[31.30 --> 32.18]  I'm actually stoked on this.
[32.48 --> 32.94]  Stoked!
[33.20 --> 33.42]  Okay.
[34.62 --> 38.04]  And mostly other privacy stuff.
[38.46 --> 43.94]  But also, the FTC says warranty void stickers, like warranty void if removed stickers, are BS.
[44.10 --> 44.52]  Bullshit!
[44.86 --> 46.50]  Which is awesome. That makes me really happy.
[46.62 --> 51.04]  But stay tuned to see that and more on the WAN show that is actually going to have an intro today.
[51.16 --> 51.98]  We're doing the intro.
[51.98 --> 54.44]  Oh, no! It wasn't ready! Colton!
[56.70 --> 57.52]  Spoiler alert.
[57.78 --> 58.28]  So close.
[58.28 --> 58.60]  Sponshares.
[59.18 --> 60.82]  The answer to that question was no.
[64.54 --> 65.94]  And we're dead!
[68.40 --> 69.46]  Okay, okay, okay.
[72.24 --> 73.24]  Be quiet!
[73.64 --> 74.88]  Which you already saw, I think.
[75.02 --> 78.32]  Synergy 2 and Squarespace.
[79.18 --> 79.62]  Awesome.
[79.62 --> 82.06]  I'm going to push this back to the top so it works next time.
[82.84 --> 83.86]  And go like that.
[84.02 --> 84.56]  There we go.
[85.20 --> 85.78]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[85.92 --> 88.46]  You might be able to tell we've had a little bit of change of scenery.
[88.76 --> 91.74]  We're actually in pretty close to the same area.
[91.96 --> 95.82]  But I can't tell you why things have obviously changed.
[96.08 --> 97.16]  Or for how long.
[97.24 --> 98.26]  Or if they'll go back.
[98.30 --> 99.32]  Or when they'll go back.
[99.36 --> 100.32]  Or any of that detail.
[100.32 --> 103.00]  So speculate as you will.
[103.82 --> 106.38]  That's, I think, all I can do.
[106.60 --> 107.20]  So, how you been, buddy?
[107.28 --> 107.52]  Let's go.
[107.60 --> 108.14]  I've been good.
[108.20 --> 108.56]  You've been away.
[108.64 --> 109.36]  I haven't seen you in like...
[109.36 --> 110.28]  I have been mostly away.
[110.42 --> 113.50]  I was like, I'm going to be in office way more from now on.
[113.54 --> 114.60]  I made it in one day this week.
[114.78 --> 115.10]  It was great.
[115.10 --> 117.76]  Wait, you were in the city, like in the country all week?
[118.04 --> 118.26]  Yeah.
[118.54 --> 120.16]  You've been back from PAX like that whole time?
[120.22 --> 120.42]  Yeah.
[120.68 --> 120.88]  Oh.
[121.10 --> 123.00]  I thought I was like, yeah, he's back from PAX.
[123.10 --> 123.34]  Cool.
[123.46 --> 124.04]  Like, what happened?
[124.12 --> 124.82]  Tell us about it.
[124.90 --> 126.44]  No, I got back on Sunday.
[126.58 --> 127.22]  PAX was good.
[128.94 --> 131.22]  There was really not a lot of hardware stuff there.
[131.70 --> 132.24]  We used to...
[132.24 --> 135.52]  So, like, back when I first started working here, I asked Linus.
[135.56 --> 137.98]  My first time off request ever was to go to PAX.
[138.50 --> 138.78]  Okay.
[138.78 --> 143.64]  And I was like, just assume that I'm going to ask for this time off for the rest of my career working with you.
[144.36 --> 150.78]  And then immediately the next year, he was like, you're going to work it just at PAX.
[151.06 --> 153.70]  And I was like, okay, well, that sounds like a pretty okay compromise.
[153.98 --> 156.52]  So, I started making videos at PAX about computer hardware.
[156.64 --> 160.00]  Now, in retrospect, good compromise.
[160.18 --> 161.92]  It was interesting.
[162.12 --> 163.42]  It was a fun thing to do.
[163.74 --> 166.98]  I really like PAX, so I've been to, like, 15 of them.
[167.12 --> 169.08]  So, working some of those was probably okay.
[170.12 --> 174.20]  But there used to be an abundance of new interesting stuff at PAX.
[174.34 --> 175.24]  It was usually peripherals.
[175.34 --> 176.14]  We get a lot of keyboards.
[176.28 --> 176.94]  We get a lot of mice.
[177.06 --> 177.94]  Get a lot of headsets.
[178.04 --> 178.76]  That kind of stuff.
[178.76 --> 181.02]  But we'd sometimes get cases and a few other things.
[181.18 --> 183.24]  There was never, like, a graphics card or something.
[183.46 --> 185.84]  But there was always a lot of technology videos to make.
[185.90 --> 186.12]  Sure.
[186.52 --> 188.68]  That slowly started dwindling over the years.
[188.82 --> 193.80]  The amount of potential technology videos at PAX slowly started reducing constantly over time.
[193.84 --> 194.46]  But here's my question.
[194.60 --> 194.88]  Yes.
[194.88 --> 202.02]  So, do you prefer to go as Luke or as Luke from Linus Media Group?
[202.24 --> 206.56]  I can't not go as Luke from Linus Media Group.
[206.60 --> 206.94]  Now.
[207.34 --> 207.50]  Yeah.
[207.54 --> 207.94]  I guess.
[208.06 --> 213.70]  But, like, on your third or fourth time there, when maybe people didn't know you were Luke from Linus Media Group as much.
[213.70 --> 214.12]  Oh, okay.
[214.30 --> 214.74]  So...
[214.74 --> 216.72]  You were working there, but you weren't, like, super famous.
[217.58 --> 218.86]  So, that would be...
[218.86 --> 219.04]  Yeah.
[219.12 --> 221.16]  There was, like, one year in that gap.
[221.88 --> 223.30]  And that was pretty good.
[223.34 --> 225.90]  It was funny because my dad always does this.
[226.02 --> 226.56]  So, okay.
[227.26 --> 228.02]  A little bit of backstory.
[228.16 --> 229.06]  When I go to PAX West...
[229.06 --> 230.80]  I was born at PAX.
[231.02 --> 232.64]  Back in the old days.
[232.88 --> 235.44]  I was conceived at the Corsair booth.
[235.44 --> 236.92]  My dad's been to a million years.
[237.48 --> 237.66]  Yeah.
[237.74 --> 237.92]  I know.
[238.04 --> 241.84]  So, my dad brought me to PAX as a, like, as a birthday present.
[242.30 --> 243.66]  And he brought myself my best friend.
[243.66 --> 246.04]  And so, we went from when I was, like, really young.
[246.60 --> 251.68]  And the first year that any amount of people knew me at all, which was a very, very small amount of people.
[251.84 --> 253.60]  Because I think I had been in one WAN show.
[253.72 --> 254.10]  That's it.
[254.24 --> 254.56]  Oh, wow.
[254.58 --> 255.60]  By the time I went to this PAX.
[257.36 --> 262.12]  That year, my dad would, like, look around for anyone that stared at me for too long.
[262.22 --> 262.46]  Okay.
[262.56 --> 263.72]  And then would go, like, get them.
[263.96 --> 265.18]  And get them to come over to me.
[265.20 --> 265.58]  God thinks you're hot.
[265.66 --> 265.92]  Yeah.
[268.02 --> 268.96]  I don't know who he is.
[269.10 --> 269.80]  He just looks...
[269.80 --> 270.74]  Come say hi to this person.
[270.82 --> 271.10]  Interesting.
[271.62 --> 272.14]  So, yeah.
[272.22 --> 273.02]  That was pretty cool.
[273.02 --> 273.48]  But, yeah.
[273.66 --> 274.08]  No, it's...
[274.08 --> 274.58]  I still...
[274.58 --> 275.68]  I really like meeting people.
[276.40 --> 281.78]  I think the reason why I would have probably preferred the old one was because I liked PAX more back in the day.
[282.40 --> 284.14]  But that's not actually...
[284.14 --> 285.62]  That doesn't have anything to do with meeting fans.
[285.62 --> 285.64]  Yeah.
[285.64 --> 290.50]  Well, that was my question ultimately was, now that there's fewer videos to make, do you get to enjoy the show more?
[290.66 --> 293.18]  And it's kind of, like, the best of all worlds.
[293.18 --> 295.54]  I would have if there was more stuff to check out.
[296.02 --> 297.94]  The show overall is just...
[297.94 --> 299.64]  It's much bigger now.
[299.64 --> 299.70]  Oh.
[299.70 --> 305.50]  And when you become much bigger in terms of those types of shows, it usually becomes a little bit more corporate, a little bit more stale.
[305.56 --> 306.74]  There's more rules now.
[307.56 --> 309.86]  Like, back in the day, a booth would have, like, a giveaway.
[310.30 --> 311.58]  And everyone would swarm it.
[311.62 --> 312.98]  And they'd, like, throw stuff out.
[313.02 --> 313.74]  And it was crazy.
[313.86 --> 315.22]  Now, you're not allowed throwing things.
[315.48 --> 316.86]  Because probably someone got hurt.
[317.66 --> 319.36]  Which has to ruin the fun and everything.
[320.40 --> 321.62]  And, like, I don't know.
[321.68 --> 321.98]  It just...
[321.98 --> 322.70]  It became bigger.
[322.78 --> 323.42]  It became more corporate.
[323.54 --> 325.60]  It's not as, like, niche and nerdy anymore.
[325.60 --> 328.06]  It's still really cool.
[328.14 --> 328.78]  It's a great event.
[328.98 --> 329.50]  I love going to PAX.
[329.50 --> 331.16]  I hope LTX never suffers from that.
[331.22 --> 332.76]  Remember how much stuff we threw last year?
[332.84 --> 333.16]  Exactly.
[333.16 --> 334.64]  A lady almost got murked, man.
[335.34 --> 336.48]  It was, like, serious.
[336.58 --> 339.56]  It was serious, like, looking out at the sides of your eyes, biting your finger.
[339.78 --> 341.80]  Like, that was actually too bad.
[342.00 --> 343.64]  Like, that was too far, guys.
[343.64 --> 344.62]  The case toss.
[344.94 --> 346.62]  We are enclosing it this time.
[346.86 --> 348.32]  And that's what I was actually going to say.
[348.36 --> 349.90]  Not to promote LTX too much.
[350.52 --> 351.94]  I don't even think we're supposed to on this show.
[352.02 --> 352.94]  But I'm doing it anyways.
[353.16 --> 353.70]  It's going to be dope.
[353.70 --> 355.32]  So it was amazing.
[355.76 --> 357.42]  The first year we had, it was so much fun.
[357.78 --> 359.58]  And I think there was some definite problems.
[359.68 --> 361.74]  Like, the main stage was kind of underproduced.
[362.10 --> 363.12]  And there was a couple other issues.
[363.12 --> 364.00]  The sound was a big issue.
[364.08 --> 364.84]  The music was an issue.
[364.96 --> 366.88]  Linus wore a toque, and that really bothered me.
[369.06 --> 369.46]  Personally.
[370.54 --> 371.80]  I love how that's...
[371.80 --> 373.86]  That's, like, the main stage was an issue.
[374.08 --> 375.02]  The sound is a big issue.
[375.30 --> 377.20]  Linus wore clothing that I didn't appreciate.
[377.62 --> 380.22]  Well, I mostly saw him when he was on stage.
[380.22 --> 382.32]  And every time he came out and he had a toque on, I was like,
[382.32 --> 385.26]  who's this, like, opening hip-hop act?
[385.40 --> 386.48]  Like, who's this guy?
[386.74 --> 387.64]  And then it was Linus.
[387.68 --> 388.36]  And I was like, what?
[389.24 --> 390.80]  A toque isn't part of your, like...
[390.80 --> 392.22]  He's, like, never worn that on camera.
[392.22 --> 393.08]  It's not part of your uniform.
[393.40 --> 393.94]  Yeah, I hear you.
[394.20 --> 394.64]  I hear you.
[395.60 --> 396.50]  Yeah, I don't know.
[396.62 --> 398.00]  I'm really excited for the next one.
[398.04 --> 398.60]  It's going to be bigger.
[398.90 --> 399.80]  We're going to have more booths.
[400.00 --> 400.86]  The main stage is going to be better.
[400.96 --> 402.24]  Linus maybe won't wear a toque.
[403.08 --> 403.92]  I'm not going to let him.
[404.10 --> 409.00]  The enclosed case toss is going to be sweet because you can do bank shots and try to damage it more
[409.00 --> 410.20]  by getting some kind of angle.
[410.56 --> 411.92]  That's not going to be my strategy anyway.
[412.28 --> 412.50]  You know?
[412.54 --> 414.16]  Are you going to try to go off a sidewall or the roof?
[415.02 --> 415.66]  I don't know how.
[415.78 --> 417.74]  Or, like, roof, sidewall, ground.
[418.00 --> 418.78]  You don't even have to...
[418.78 --> 421.14]  I guess it's a distance challenge, not a damaging challenge.
[421.14 --> 425.92]  Because if it was just trying to break the case, you could just go completely laterally right into the wall.
[426.16 --> 426.40]  Yeah!
[428.28 --> 429.80]  Break the whole booth in half.
[430.04 --> 430.86]  Like, yes!
[431.08 --> 432.96]  I'm sure there'll be some kind of troll shots like that.
[433.08 --> 433.84]  Yeah, probably.
[434.48 --> 436.54]  Anyways, we should probably talk about actual news.
[436.54 --> 445.38]  I think we already introduced a bunch of topics, but we can start with probably the most expected topic of the week.
[445.68 --> 449.64]  Is that we learned this week that Zuckerberg drinks water like this.
[452.90 --> 454.00]  He's been working on this.
[454.10 --> 455.42]  It's actually pretty good at this point.
[460.36 --> 461.34]  Yeah, yeah.
[461.56 --> 463.00]  Lin, you've got to do the smile meter thing.
[463.00 --> 465.56]  I can't do it.
[465.62 --> 466.86]  I can't do that smoothly.
[467.20 --> 468.82]  His smile meter is so granular.
[469.34 --> 470.42]  The steps are tiny.
[473.12 --> 473.92]  It's so good.
[474.02 --> 475.44]  Okay, so I'm going to...
[475.44 --> 475.76]  Let me...
[475.76 --> 476.04]  Hold on.
[476.08 --> 477.98]  I've got to be Linus here for a second, which I'm not used to.
[478.08 --> 478.56]  There we go.
[479.24 --> 482.44]  Facebook users aren't changing their privacy settings despite uproar.
[482.52 --> 484.00]  So this has been a pretty interesting...
[484.64 --> 485.04]  Wait a second.
[485.32 --> 486.28]  Who posted that on the forum?
[488.06 --> 489.00]  Shorty88Jr.
[489.42 --> 490.22]  Good job, Shorty.
[490.22 --> 491.16]  We always forget.
[491.32 --> 491.68]  We do.
[491.88 --> 492.60]  Thank you, Shorty.
[492.60 --> 492.82]  Thank you so much.
[492.90 --> 493.56]  I appreciate it.
[494.42 --> 496.44]  Yeah, so people aren't really leaving.
[496.66 --> 498.16]  People aren't changing their privacy settings.
[498.52 --> 501.80]  Apparently, people aren't even changing what type of things they share with the platform.
[502.14 --> 504.04]  So there's this giant uproar.
[505.96 --> 508.32]  Well, actually, I think it kind of speaks to the whole issue.
[508.44 --> 510.88]  Because if you watch any of the Congress...
[510.88 --> 512.62]  I don't even know what you call that.
[513.30 --> 516.62]  The inspection of Zuckerberg.
[516.62 --> 517.90]  A lot of it was like...
[517.90 --> 522.80]  He keeps defaulting to be like, okay, we do tell them everything.
[522.90 --> 524.22]  Our terms of service is all here.
[524.34 --> 524.98]  Nobody reads it.
[525.18 --> 525.58]  It's garbage.
[525.58 --> 527.08]  But we know that nobody reads it.
[527.14 --> 536.76]  So we also have these little dialogue boxes that are the top of your news feed that tell you like, hey, in plain English, you can share this with the world or not.
[536.76 --> 540.42]  They do all these things to make it transparent what they're doing.
[541.42 --> 542.48]  It's just no one cares, though.
[543.10 --> 543.88]  No one cares.
[545.18 --> 547.34]  Like, by and large, no one cares.
[547.76 --> 548.16]  So I think...
[548.16 --> 551.20]  A surprisingly low amount of people actually care about their privacy.
[551.50 --> 552.20]  There is like...
[552.20 --> 556.84]  And I bet you an abnormally high percentage of the audience here.
[556.90 --> 559.54]  And I think an abnormally high percentage of tech people in general.
[559.64 --> 565.58]  Because I think those people actually understand better what's happening when they're putting their privacy out there.
[566.66 --> 574.52]  I think the average person sees it as like, oh, some mega corporation knows that I like thong sandals.
[574.64 --> 575.66]  Yeah, they've got nothing to hide.
[575.78 --> 577.68]  Maybe they'll sell me a few thong sandals.
[577.68 --> 581.04]  And they don't understand that like, it's going further than that.
[581.10 --> 582.94]  And your data is being picked apart further than that.
[583.00 --> 585.14]  And Facebook is selling it to people that you don't necessarily know.
[585.18 --> 586.10]  Well, they don't sell the data.
[586.78 --> 588.80]  Well, it gets given away.
[589.32 --> 589.66]  It did.
[589.66 --> 590.06]  Improperly.
[590.22 --> 590.42]  Yeah.
[590.80 --> 591.78]  Well, it still does.
[591.94 --> 592.14]  Yeah.
[592.22 --> 593.24]  It really did before.
[593.56 --> 593.78]  Yeah.
[594.08 --> 595.24]  So, I don't know.
[595.44 --> 599.54]  And like the fact that a myriad of platforms get hacked every single year.
[599.74 --> 601.60]  And people's data gets pulled out of that.
[601.72 --> 603.28]  Not saying that happened to Facebook.
[603.50 --> 604.98]  But it happens to a huge amount of people.
[604.98 --> 608.30]  You can check out, I think it's haveibeenpwned.com.
[608.50 --> 608.72]  Yeah.
[608.92 --> 609.10]  Yeah.
[609.10 --> 610.54]  That's not specifically Facebook data.
[610.82 --> 611.02]  No.
[611.18 --> 613.54]  I'm saying, I'm talking about privacy in general.
[613.58 --> 613.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[613.86 --> 616.76]  I actually said specifically, I don't think it's happened to Facebook like at all.
[616.80 --> 617.00]  Correct.
[617.00 --> 620.44]  But there has been huge companies that have had leaks like that.
[621.30 --> 626.54]  And those leaks could make your Facebook vulnerable if you're using the same password across lots of sites.
[626.66 --> 628.82]  So, what normally happens is like LinkedIn got hacked.
[629.38 --> 633.02]  So, the dark webs has your password for LinkedIn.
[633.02 --> 639.36]  That gets bought by someone else who takes that password and tries it in a bunch of other sites like your email, your bank, Facebook.
[639.80 --> 645.76]  And if you're the type of person that has the same password for everything, you might be compromised on lots of sites that never actually got hacked themselves.
[647.08 --> 647.52]  Yeah.
[649.38 --> 655.16]  And like what I was more getting to is just the idea that people don't understand how their data can spread.
[655.16 --> 659.76]  And like not just on Facebook, I mean in terms of using the internet as a whole.
[659.94 --> 668.56]  Non-tech people don't necessarily understand how like putting their data in some place or putting their credit card information in some place can result in it getting to other places.
[670.48 --> 670.92]  But...
[670.92 --> 677.86]  It kind of leads into the regulation discussion here because there's a lot of talk about regulating Facebook.
[677.98 --> 679.94]  And there's kind of three different ways that that could go.
[680.36 --> 684.52]  The first is what Facebook would probably like, which is just to self-regulate.
[685.16 --> 687.16]  And that seems more and more...
[687.16 --> 687.94]  Basically, everybody wants.
[688.54 --> 693.16]  It seems more and more that it's like maybe less likely to me anyway because...
[693.94 --> 694.88]  Like to happen?
[695.12 --> 695.36]  Yeah.
[695.42 --> 695.62]  Okay.
[695.72 --> 696.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[696.16 --> 697.76]  Because there's this awesome article.
[697.86 --> 699.02]  It's been written by Zeynep.
[699.08 --> 699.74]  What's her last name?
[700.38 --> 702.54]  She's that security researcher.
[702.82 --> 704.90]  I'm really bad with names, especially last names.
[705.54 --> 706.16]  She's awesome.
[706.24 --> 711.48]  She wrote this kind of article that blew up about like 14 years of Facebook's apology to her.
[711.66 --> 712.16]  Oh, yeah.
[712.16 --> 713.56]  Since the beginning, they've been...
[713.56 --> 722.50]  Like a lot of people gave props to Zuckerberg for kind of taking ownership of what has happened at Facebook and apologizing for it and not like deflecting or saying mistakes were made.
[722.66 --> 725.28]  But at the same time, he's been doing that for like a decade and a half.
[725.62 --> 729.82]  So at some point, it's like stop letting him screw up so much.
[730.04 --> 730.12]  Yeah.
[730.12 --> 732.74]  So option one, Facebook self-regulates.
[733.48 --> 735.70]  Option two, they regulate the entire industry.
[736.48 --> 738.88]  That would be really stifling to innovation.
[739.12 --> 739.44]  Yeah.
[739.50 --> 739.70]  Really.
[739.76 --> 750.98]  If you've ever worked at a company that was undergoing some kind of like, you know, we're going to implement compliance for HIPAA, which is like a health care security thing.
[750.98 --> 756.34]  That stuff is intense and drains company resources more than you could ever imagine unless you've actually gone through it yourself.
[756.46 --> 756.98]  It's crazy.
[757.66 --> 758.98]  And there's a ton like that.
[759.04 --> 766.46]  So if there was something like that for the social media industry, you can basically guarantee yourself that there would be no new upstarts.
[767.66 --> 770.88]  Like that's hard enough to make a new social network.
[770.96 --> 773.76]  It's hard enough given that network effects are such an important part of it.
[773.76 --> 776.36]  Like you need to have a bunch of users before it's useful to people.
[776.48 --> 783.38]  If you're going to have this other layer of compliance, you're basically solidifying Facebook's position and all incumbents positions.
[783.96 --> 788.20]  So that's, yeah, I don't think you're guaranteeing that there will be no challenges.
[789.44 --> 796.50]  But I haven't seen, even without this, I haven't seen very many successful challenges to Facebook at all anyways.
[797.02 --> 798.32]  Google Plus completely failed.
[799.02 --> 802.54]  And anyone that really tries just gets bought and consumed anyways.
[802.54 --> 806.58]  Well, that's what was funny when that one senator was like, who's your biggest competitor?
[807.08 --> 813.92]  It's like you don't understand network economies because by virtue of the way they work, there are no competitors.
[814.18 --> 820.56]  It's like it's a win or take all situation where like everyone's on this platform, therefore everyone's using this platform.
[821.04 --> 821.96]  And you can't split them.
[822.08 --> 827.06]  There could never be half the people here and half there with completely overlapping functions.
[827.14 --> 828.02]  It doesn't work that way.
[828.02 --> 841.42]  Option three for regulation would be if Facebook itself just has a like dedicated third party or agency that only regulates Facebook, like some kind of steward of the data.
[841.42 --> 844.42]  To me, that's like the most likely situation.
[844.42 --> 849.26]  But this one too enshrines Facebook's current market position.
[849.58 --> 858.10]  Because if it's the case that Facebook has so much data about you and they regulate such that that data can never leave Facebook,
[858.10 --> 867.30]  then no one else has no upstarts have access to that data in the way that the developers on the Facebook platform did in the past.
[867.36 --> 870.42]  And that's how Cambridge Analytica came to get the big data that leaked anyway.
[871.00 --> 875.70]  So if no one has access to that, then they're just sitting on this goldmine of data that no one can compete with.
[875.70 --> 879.12]  So you're kind of in a pickle either way.
[880.62 --> 886.60]  So I'm going to make a straw poll here, which is how should Facebook be regulated or not?
[887.80 --> 888.80]  You need four, bro.
[889.76 --> 891.20]  Yeah, it self-expands.
[892.78 --> 893.32]  Watch this.
[893.44 --> 894.66]  Dude, it self-regulates.
[894.96 --> 895.16]  Wait.
[895.32 --> 896.98]  Oh, I think I have to fill this one out.
[897.28 --> 897.46]  Maybe.
[897.52 --> 898.12]  And then hit enter.
[899.08 --> 900.36]  Not regulated, self-regulated.
[900.88 --> 901.58]  There we go.
[902.12 --> 902.46]  Nice.
[902.46 --> 904.74]  Regulation.
[905.74 --> 906.94]  But like dedicated.
[907.20 --> 908.50]  They only regulate Facebook.
[914.28 --> 916.08]  I can't type on this keyboard for some reason.
[916.38 --> 917.46]  Probably because it's way over there.
[917.54 --> 918.76]  It's just a really weird one.
[919.06 --> 920.46]  It's this QWERTY layout.
[920.66 --> 921.32]  I don't know if you're familiar.
[922.92 --> 924.26]  I'm used to Dvorak.
[924.26 --> 924.68]  I know.
[924.84 --> 925.38]  I can't do it.
[925.46 --> 927.56]  It's been around since the 1870s, but whatever.
[927.56 --> 935.06]  Okay, so we have not regulated, self-regulated, third-party regulations specifically for Facebook
[935.06 --> 937.70]  and government wide-spanning regulations.
[937.70 --> 939.88]  Are you going to put a troll on there with donkey balls?
[940.80 --> 941.24]  Donkey.
[942.06 --> 942.50]  Come on.
[942.70 --> 942.90]  Nope.
[942.96 --> 944.08]  Last week it was donkey balls.
[944.38 --> 944.80]  Oh.
[946.56 --> 947.64]  We've been regulated.
[949.74 --> 950.26]  Internally.
[950.56 --> 951.24]  Self-regulated.
[952.12 --> 953.84]  Okay, so check that straw poll out.
[954.20 --> 955.02]  Hit us with the feedback.
[955.02 --> 956.48]  I want to see what you guys think.
[958.68 --> 960.70]  I kind of have my own opinion, but.
[961.10 --> 962.28]  Ooh, do you have a.
[963.28 --> 968.70]  While we wait for that, let's fantasize about some kind of future epic social network startup
[968.70 --> 974.28]  that's all blockchain based where every individual's data is completely owned by them is on a blockchain
[974.28 --> 980.04]  so that the entire internet is modular so that you can switch from one social network to another
[980.04 --> 984.24]  and bring your data with you and release to each social network exactly what you want.
[984.24 --> 990.10]  That would be the most beneficial to new innovation because you could start up your own social network
[990.10 --> 994.46]  and people could come to it and be like, here's all the data and here's all the connections,
[994.62 --> 1000.80]  here's all the people I know, and suddenly you'd have like this really thick market and strong network effects right away.
[1001.52 --> 1002.78]  Someone said it's called Steemit.
[1002.98 --> 1004.24]  Wow, I don't like that platform.
[1004.48 --> 1006.32]  But is that how that actually works?
[1006.32 --> 1010.80]  I know that platform is blockchain based, but is it like what you're describing?
[1010.88 --> 1011.76]  I don't think so.
[1011.90 --> 1012.42]  I have no idea.
[1012.52 --> 1018.92]  But what I have heard is that all the current social like blockchain based social media projects are junk.
[1019.42 --> 1019.76]  Yeah.
[1019.76 --> 1020.90]  I heard it on a podcast.
[1021.02 --> 1021.86]  I don't actually know.
[1022.00 --> 1023.16]  I haven't tried it myself.
[1023.90 --> 1024.42]  Pied Piper.
[1024.42 --> 1029.52]  I wouldn't put steam in my title.
[1029.84 --> 1031.68]  Sounds like steaming pile, you know?
[1031.80 --> 1036.20]  It's like S-T-E-E-M-I-T or something like that.
[1036.28 --> 1037.56]  I don't remember exactly how it works.
[1038.00 --> 1040.10]  I'm going to check in on this straw poll actually.
[1040.42 --> 1040.86]  Let's see.
[1041.64 --> 1041.94]  Wow.
[1042.04 --> 1042.32]  Okay.
[1042.34 --> 1044.80]  Not a meaningful split at all really.
[1045.88 --> 1046.28]  Donkey.
[1046.92 --> 1047.24]  Donkey.
[1047.80 --> 1048.94]  Second place.
[1049.06 --> 1049.36]  Okay.
[1049.36 --> 1052.94]  That plays into what we were saying earlier where it's like, honestly, most people don't really care.
[1052.94 --> 1056.30]  Or maybe they care, but they just don't know.
[1056.80 --> 1057.54]  Well, that's fair.
[1058.60 --> 1061.98]  I should have had a, like, I don't know and an I don't care.
[1062.20 --> 1062.74]  That should have been.
[1062.80 --> 1063.28]  That's Donkey.
[1063.76 --> 1064.24]  I guess.
[1064.52 --> 1065.34]  The two together.
[1065.52 --> 1067.28]  But, yeah, that's the problem is that they're both together.
[1067.54 --> 1068.18]  So, right now.
[1068.20 --> 1068.50]  Oh, right.
[1068.54 --> 1069.40]  I'm not on the screen.
[1070.34 --> 1074.40]  Right now we're looking at 25% for third party regulation specifically for Facebook.
[1074.60 --> 1076.18]  I'm kind of surprised by that.
[1077.80 --> 1078.58]  Do tell.
[1078.94 --> 1082.50]  I'm just kind of surprised by that because in that situation you're putting a weight.
[1082.94 --> 1085.52]  On Facebook, which I don't think anyone's going to care about.
[1085.76 --> 1090.88]  But you're putting a weight on Facebook so that opens the door to more other platforms.
[1091.36 --> 1093.84]  But then those other platforms are probably going to have the same problem.
[1094.68 --> 1101.28]  And then do you at that point, once they're big, take the regulation specifically for Facebook and then push it on them?
[1101.28 --> 1110.40]  Or, like, so do you just let people run rampant with other people's data at the beginning and then go, like, you shouldn't have done that.
[1110.50 --> 1111.70]  But we didn't tell you not to.
[1111.76 --> 1112.26]  So, it's okay.
[1112.26 --> 1113.28]  But now you have to stop.
[1114.14 --> 1114.32]  Yeah.
[1114.42 --> 1119.22]  It kind of sounds like you need to have a hybrid approach where there are certain ground rules for everybody to begin with.
[1119.36 --> 1121.48]  But there already is existing laws.
[1121.48 --> 1126.44]  Plus, you also have to consider users' choices, right?
[1126.58 --> 1134.26]  Like, because this is happening, there's a societal shift where people are prioritizing and caring more about this kind of thing, right?
[1134.26 --> 1142.00]  So, if a new upstart comes knocking on your door asking you to become a user, you're more likely to ask, like, well, what kind of data?
[1142.12 --> 1142.92]  Like, what are you guys doing?
[1142.96 --> 1143.68]  What do you want from me?
[1143.92 --> 1144.10]  Yeah.
[1144.10 --> 1149.74]  So, in that climate, then, like, maybe a light touch regulation is enough.
[1150.34 --> 1150.74]  I don't know.
[1151.02 --> 1160.06]  And then people, the next highest category that wasn't donkey was government-wide spanning regulation, which I'm not super surprised was up there.
[1160.34 --> 1164.44]  Not regulated, I'm honestly pretty surprised that that even got 13%.
[1164.44 --> 1167.52]  But then, I guess there are...
[1167.52 --> 1171.82]  Well, those are the people who know how to set the permissions the way they actually want.
[1171.82 --> 1172.18]  Yeah, that's fair.
[1172.18 --> 1174.26]  It's like, it's going fine, just read the TOS.
[1175.36 --> 1178.46]  Yeah, people who are going to actually, like, manage it properly themselves.
[1179.66 --> 1183.40]  Which, unfortunately, isn't everybody, which is, I guess, the problem I have with it.
[1183.44 --> 1186.82]  Because, like, my mom is not going to understand what to do.
[1187.26 --> 1187.84]  Hi, mom.
[1187.90 --> 1188.60]  She's listening.
[1188.68 --> 1189.44]  She's probably watching.
[1189.80 --> 1191.80]  But, like, I'm not saying that in an offensive way.
[1191.82 --> 1192.64]  She's sitting there nodding.
[1192.72 --> 1193.28]  She's like, yeah.
[1193.28 --> 1194.80]  Yeah, like, it's...
[1194.80 --> 1197.22]  My mom's actually surprisingly good with some things.
[1197.30 --> 1204.42]  But she can also somehow manage to send emails with her text messaging program without any of us being able to figure out how for, like, months at a time.
[1205.38 --> 1206.60]  Like, it's...
[1206.60 --> 1209.30]  There's people that have a special touch with technology.
[1209.52 --> 1211.88]  And there's people that when they use it, it falls apart magically.
[1211.88 --> 1216.46]  And, like, as far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with being her fault.
[1216.54 --> 1217.60]  But anyways, I love you, mom.
[1217.62 --> 1217.90]  The bad touch.
[1219.60 --> 1220.92]  But, like, I don't know.
[1221.08 --> 1223.24]  There's people that are super in the know in a platform.
[1223.44 --> 1224.48]  And there's people that aren't.
[1224.92 --> 1225.86]  And it varies.
[1226.34 --> 1228.04]  I took my socks off right before the show.
[1228.18 --> 1229.34]  But now I want them back on.
[1230.08 --> 1230.40]  Why?
[1230.70 --> 1231.94]  My feet got cold.
[1232.06 --> 1232.92]  Oh, my goodness.
[1233.40 --> 1234.34]  You having cold feet?
[1235.26 --> 1235.62]  Yeah.
[1235.62 --> 1237.66]  About this regulation platform idea?
[1237.88 --> 1238.66]  Yeah, changed my mind.
[1238.66 --> 1242.68]  If we could get, like, four more people to vote for Donkey, that would be great.
[1242.82 --> 1243.92]  Because then it would be in first place.
[1244.16 --> 1245.96]  And then we can just be done with this straw poll.
[1246.66 --> 1249.62]  But I think we're probably done with this topic in general.
[1249.84 --> 1252.14]  Meanwhile, AMD Navi GPUs.
[1252.26 --> 1252.52]  Yeah.
[1252.74 --> 1254.00]  Rumor of a mill time.
[1254.18 --> 1255.86]  Let's get away from...
[1255.86 --> 1256.90]  Don't come through this way.
[1256.98 --> 1257.90]  Go away, please.
[1258.18 --> 1258.64]  Thank you.
[1260.86 --> 1263.24]  Let's jump down to AMD Navi.
[1263.24 --> 1267.48]  Navi is the next generation of architecture from AMD GPUs.
[1267.48 --> 1269.66]  And it is a 7 nanometer architecture.
[1269.96 --> 1277.72]  And the rumor these days is that it's not going to be the source of the next wave of enthusiast cards.
[1278.30 --> 1280.94]  It's not going to be the next Vega.
[1281.74 --> 1286.86]  In fact, it's going to be what they call the mainstream lineup.
[1287.16 --> 1289.66]  Or mainstream tier, which right now is the RX 580s.
[1289.70 --> 1290.12]  Those guys.
[1290.12 --> 1293.20]  Also, thank you, Ryujin2013 on the forums.
[1293.72 --> 1294.08]  Yeah.
[1294.08 --> 1305.12]  So, what they're saying is that when these cards launch in 2019, they're going to have a comparable performance to a GTX 1080.
[1305.62 --> 1309.94]  Which came out in the end of May, basically June 2016.
[1310.50 --> 1312.58]  But it'll cost about $250.
[1313.52 --> 1314.60]  Which is nice.
[1315.38 --> 1317.72]  Because buying a 1080 right now is more than that.
[1317.72 --> 1318.86]  Or MSRP, $250.
[1320.02 --> 1321.80]  Who knows what it'll actually cost.
[1321.96 --> 1322.30]  Fair.
[1322.54 --> 1325.84]  Mining stuff is going down a lot because Bitcoin's super down right now.
[1326.10 --> 1327.66]  Well, it's going up in the last day or two.
[1327.82 --> 1328.34]  Oh, has it?
[1328.42 --> 1328.70]  Yes.
[1328.82 --> 1329.22]  Oh, no.
[1329.28 --> 1330.06]  Is it coming back again?
[1330.08 --> 1330.98]  Yes, it's back, baby.
[1331.48 --> 1332.30]  Back again.
[1333.94 --> 1335.74]  Oh, dear.
[1335.74 --> 1341.52]  And then with new cards that are high performance for lower dollar value, it might become more profitable.
[1341.86 --> 1342.72]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1343.02 --> 1343.82]  So, we'll see.
[1344.18 --> 1344.50]  But, yeah.
[1344.60 --> 1347.98]  MSRP has not been a realistic thing for actually quite a long time.
[1348.98 --> 1350.58]  Especially on the AMD side.
[1350.58 --> 1359.88]  We've seen accidental, artificial, whatever spawned from Bitcoin inflation, whatever you want on GPUs for quite a long time.
[1359.88 --> 1367.38]  Even well before it was identified as being a Bitcoin mining problem, we had inflation at graphics card prices.
[1367.38 --> 1369.42]  All the way from back to the launch of these cards.
[1369.58 --> 1372.76]  Which was well before mining Bitcoin was like super trendy.
[1373.16 --> 1374.92]  Oh, the launch of the GTX cards.
[1375.10 --> 1375.20]  Yeah.
[1375.32 --> 1375.40]  Okay.
[1376.20 --> 1384.08]  I thought when I first read that and I read that they were aiming Navi at this particular market segment, I thought, are they doing that to satisfy shareholders?
[1384.22 --> 1385.38]  Is it just more cost effective?
[1385.38 --> 1390.84]  And they're going to, it's a bigger addressable market because stop it, Max, you're doing that thing you said you're going to do.
[1391.32 --> 1392.04]  Get out of here.
[1393.68 --> 1394.24]  All right.
[1394.94 --> 1401.08]  There's just more people who have the money to buy a cheaper but like still good, like well performing card.
[1401.08 --> 1403.70]  $250 is a really nice price point for a graphics card.
[1403.98 --> 1404.06]  Yeah.
[1404.06 --> 1409.40]  Around $300 is fairly reasonable for quite a large amount of people for a graphics card.
[1409.58 --> 1409.72]  Yeah.
[1409.80 --> 1411.72]  $250 is pretty good.
[1411.72 --> 1422.76]  Still, if you can like, PCs aren't going to get here realistically, but if like at least not in the short term, but $300 in like 2013 was like the golden.
[1423.66 --> 1435.22]  I remember there was articles about it all over the place where like $300 for a relatively high ticket item was really good for consumers because a lot of people could gather that much money in a reasonable amount of saving time to buy something.
[1435.22 --> 1438.62]  This should be comparatively cheaper then because with inflation and everything.
[1438.72 --> 1440.34]  With inflation and it's $250.
[1440.82 --> 1440.92]  Yeah.
[1441.32 --> 1445.28]  But it isn't the full component for a computer, but it's a nice upgrade, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1445.30 --> 1445.80]  It goes all over the place.
[1445.80 --> 1446.56]  So it's a sound business.
[1446.76 --> 1447.14]  It's a good price.
[1447.14 --> 1449.28]  So if they're just doing this strategically, that would make sense.
[1449.36 --> 1457.58]  But then I learned that actually history is repeating itself here because this is a new, what they call manufacturing node.
[1457.76 --> 1462.10]  This is a seven nanometer part, the lithography that is.
[1462.44 --> 1471.86]  They can't get the yields on all their wafers at a rate or quantity that makes a lot of sense economically for them.
[1471.96 --> 1474.18]  So that was really convoluted.
[1474.18 --> 1477.52]  Let me just say what I actually have written down from a manufacturing point of view.
[1477.62 --> 1488.50]  It is not feasible to produce a large GPU like a 1080, like a big one or a Vega on a brand new cutting edge process like seven nanometer early in the node's life cycle.
[1488.50 --> 1491.90]  Because it's just a new technology and they haven't ironed out all the manufacturing kinks yet.
[1491.96 --> 1501.06]  So once they do, it's conceivable that in the future, maybe in 2021, that they could use the seven nanometer lithography to make bigger cards.
[1502.00 --> 1502.14]  Yeah.
[1503.38 --> 1504.02]  Makes sense.
[1504.02 --> 1505.32]  The more you know.
[1506.06 --> 1506.42]  Hooray.
[1507.64 --> 1508.76]  It's, it's, I don't know.
[1508.88 --> 1511.08]  This is good for a lot of reasons.
[1511.22 --> 1512.46]  AMD needs to keep doing well.
[1512.52 --> 1513.50]  They're doing quite well right now.
[1514.06 --> 1517.40]  One interesting observation that I had at PAX, we were talking about PAX earlier on in the show.
[1517.86 --> 1519.14]  Intel did not have a booth there.
[1519.94 --> 1520.72]  That was weird.
[1520.82 --> 1525.44]  Intel's had a booth at PAX, like every PAX as far as I know, for the last five or six years.
[1526.30 --> 1527.28]  NVIDIA wasn't there.
[1527.38 --> 1528.78]  That's not super surprising.
[1528.98 --> 1530.14]  They used to be at every PAX.
[1530.22 --> 1531.38]  Then they started dwindling off.
[1531.38 --> 1533.34]  But okay, no Intel, no NVIDIA.
[1533.72 --> 1535.70]  ASUS booth was much smaller than normal.
[1536.12 --> 1539.72]  AMD had a fairly big booth that was popping the whole event.
[1539.94 --> 1540.76]  It was full.
[1540.90 --> 1542.68]  There was queues for all the different stuff.
[1543.04 --> 1548.86]  They had, they had VR setups, but there was VR setups multiple other places on the show that didn't have a line.
[1548.86 --> 1550.96]  But the line at AMD was full all the time.
[1551.24 --> 1556.30]  It was an interesting experience to see that the community has kind of opened up to AMD as a whole.
[1556.42 --> 1561.92]  If you look back into like 2014, they were actually the very much so underdog.
[1562.18 --> 1569.26]  That like the underground people were like, yeah, I'm going to buy one of these even though like, you know, maybe it doesn't make a ton of sense.
[1569.32 --> 1569.98]  I'm going to get it anyway.
[1570.20 --> 1571.72]  Part of my money is just a donation to AMD.
[1571.72 --> 1572.56]  Yeah, basically.
[1572.94 --> 1577.72]  But now it's actually a lot more logical to go for their stuff, which is really cool.
[1577.86 --> 1579.74]  And it's really cool to see them coming back.
[1580.36 --> 1584.36]  It was a pretty awesome moment to see their booth packed at PAX.
[1584.48 --> 1584.66]  Yeah.
[1584.66 --> 1595.96]  Because even at PAX West, which was, I guess, in the very beginning of September 2017, the AMD booth was not that packed.
[1596.04 --> 1597.32]  So you're saying now that there's no.
[1597.32 --> 1598.02]  It hasn't even been that long.
[1598.10 --> 1601.96]  Now that there's no competition, their booth is popping.
[1602.80 --> 1604.48]  Well, it helped, I guess.
[1604.48 --> 1612.34]  And like they did a much better job with their booth, which in a way, kind of, sort of, not really, but kind of indirectly, maybe.
[1612.70 --> 1613.82]  There's a lot of caveats there.
[1613.92 --> 1615.80]  I keep drinking water, not like Zuckerberg.
[1615.98 --> 1616.92]  You've got to work on it.
[1616.92 --> 1617.02]  Continue.
[1618.42 --> 1619.32]  Oh, he's got it.
[1619.32 --> 1620.00]  He's got it.
[1620.48 --> 1621.42]  Sorry, I'll ignore it.
[1621.48 --> 1621.78]  I'll ignore it.
[1622.50 --> 1624.84]  It kind of shows success in the company.
[1625.04 --> 1632.02]  They have the money to flaunt at an event, spending way too much money on a ridiculously small ROI of having a booth.
[1632.36 --> 1634.24]  As a shareholder, that angers me.
[1635.12 --> 1635.30]  Yeah.
[1635.86 --> 1636.98]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[1637.30 --> 1642.54]  If you look at the ROI of a booth, you're actually not showing to that many people, and it costs a ludicrous amount of money.
[1642.80 --> 1644.84]  You're probably going to end up giving a whole bunch of product away.
[1645.36 --> 1647.08]  You're probably going to have to pay a bunch of staff.
[1647.08 --> 1651.76]  It's a really expensive thing to do, but it's to cater to your super fans.
[1651.98 --> 1654.48]  And the ROI is hard to describe, but it reaches.
[1655.78 --> 1656.34]  Branding, man.
[1656.54 --> 1656.88]  It is.
[1657.12 --> 1658.16]  Branding's huge in this space.
[1658.42 --> 1664.12]  And you're making yourself a constant part of the conversation, and you're trying to spread that ROI beyond just that event.
[1664.12 --> 1665.30]  And that's kind of the idea.
[1665.62 --> 1666.26]  So, I don't know.
[1666.38 --> 1667.76]  It was really interesting to see that.
[1667.86 --> 1673.26]  I'm very happy about AMD's fairly recent success, and I hope they keep going, and I hope this is part of it.
[1673.40 --> 1680.80]  Because if you can get 1080 performance off a $250 card, that breaches people into a way higher level of gaming.
[1680.80 --> 1683.46]  Yeah, but this is three years after the fact, though.
[1683.60 --> 1687.40]  Like, a year from now, you're going to have a 1080.
[1688.28 --> 1688.52]  Yeah.
[1688.70 --> 1689.38]  Which is, like, sounds cool.
[1689.38 --> 1696.82]  And we'll have to see, like, if mining does crash super hard, and people start selling mining cards for dirt cheap, then it might not matter.
[1696.94 --> 1699.56]  Because you might be able to get 1080s for around that price anyways.
[1699.92 --> 1701.30]  They just might be kind of sketchy.
[1702.96 --> 1704.80]  They're just the most tired cards.
[1704.98 --> 1705.16]  Yeah.
[1705.16 --> 1707.00]  Or you might get, like,
[1707.00 --> 1708.42]  I still got some games in me.
[1709.28 --> 1711.32]  You turn your computer off, and it just falls apart.
[1711.42 --> 1714.12]  Because it's like, I've been running for so long, the dust was holding me together.
[1715.00 --> 1717.80]  Or you might get 1080 Ti's for that price, or whatever else, right?
[1717.82 --> 1718.18]  Who knows?
[1718.30 --> 1723.84]  But if mining does stay up there, and the price of this does inflate, that might still even be helpful.
[1724.56 --> 1724.98]  Who knows?
[1725.54 --> 1726.52]  She's just trolling you, man.
[1726.54 --> 1727.12]  She's trolling me.
[1727.12 --> 1730.32]  There's a door that's open here for the people who don't know.
[1730.40 --> 1730.56]  Yeah.
[1731.44 --> 1732.52]  Max's loitering.
[1732.56 --> 1734.00]  We, like, have to have the door open.
[1734.42 --> 1736.34]  Because if I go to close the door...
[1736.34 --> 1736.80]  Oh, I can't.
[1736.84 --> 1737.70]  There's a sandbag in the way.
[1737.84 --> 1740.14]  But if I go to close the door, it will block the camera.
[1740.22 --> 1741.26]  Well, not entirely, actually.
[1741.44 --> 1743.74]  You just have to look through, like, a fire-raided window.
[1743.88 --> 1745.42]  I would like to end the show that way, actually.
[1746.00 --> 1746.92]  By closing the door?
[1747.06 --> 1747.24]  Yeah.
[1747.36 --> 1749.30]  I'll crawl under there, remove the sandbag.
[1749.30 --> 1750.20]  You can go bye-bye.
[1750.58 --> 1750.84]  Okay.
[1750.98 --> 1751.30]  Okay.
[1751.30 --> 1751.76]  I'm down.
[1752.10 --> 1753.44]  Wait till the end of the show.
[1753.52 --> 1754.36]  That's going to be an Easter egg.
[1754.42 --> 1754.88]  It's going to happen.
[1755.16 --> 1755.34]  Yeah.
[1755.70 --> 1756.10]  Anyways.
[1756.10 --> 1757.50]  There's a weird...
[1757.50 --> 1759.18]  A bunch of documentation showed up.
[1759.68 --> 1760.68]  This is the next topic.
[1760.94 --> 1761.32]  Oh, okay.
[1761.88 --> 1766.52]  A bunch of documentation showed up at a random...
[1766.52 --> 1771.10]  I mean, to our ears rise, anyway, people who aren't in the know in these things.
[1771.24 --> 1781.10]  A random-seeming manufacturer in China has the documentation that describes, like, specs out this new mysterious Google-branded dongle.
[1781.28 --> 1784.54]  Which is, like, a 4K Android TV dongle.
[1784.54 --> 1786.74]  As you can see.
[1786.88 --> 1787.00]  Yeah.
[1788.34 --> 1790.82]  And some people might think this is boring.
[1790.88 --> 1793.40]  Because they're like, yeah, okay, it's a Roku or it's an Amazon Fire Stick.
[1793.40 --> 1795.14]  Yeah, I was wondering why you care so much.
[1795.14 --> 1796.42]  I'll tell you why I care so much.
[1797.64 --> 1798.96]  I have a Chromecast at home.
[1799.14 --> 1799.48]  Okay.
[1800.10 --> 1801.34]  And I also have a Google Home.
[1802.28 --> 1802.64]  Okay.
[1802.86 --> 1803.80]  Those things work together.
[1804.46 --> 1806.74]  They're attached to my TV, which is a smart TV.
[1806.74 --> 1809.02]  The smart TV has a remote.
[1809.56 --> 1814.26]  And I use that remote and that smart TV to use apps like YouTube a lot.
[1814.78 --> 1822.88]  The problem is that Google Home and casting by voice is incompatible with my remote.
[1822.88 --> 1835.04]  When I cast, if I'm like, Google, play the latest Linus Tech Tips video on the TV and it plays it, I can't then grab my remote and hit next video and start scrolling around and stuff like that.
[1835.08 --> 1841.28]  Because my smart TV's YouTube app is a different app than the app that gets used when I cast things by voice.
[1841.28 --> 1843.78]  I basically have two YouTube apps on my TV.
[1844.48 --> 1846.84]  With this, you're going to be able to do that.
[1847.28 --> 1853.70]  Just like when you have an Amazon Fire TV stick, the remote is a microphone.
[1853.82 --> 1854.64]  You can talk into it.
[1855.54 --> 1856.66]  This remote is the same deal.
[1856.76 --> 1858.94]  It has a dedicated Google Assistant button on it.
[1859.08 --> 1861.16]  So this is the remote he's talking about, by the way.
[1862.04 --> 1866.88]  And presumably, I'm going to be able to say, Googstar, play this video on...
[1866.88 --> 1868.08]  I don't want to hot word people.
[1868.08 --> 1871.90]  I was going to say, you guys got to appreciate that he didn't include the first word.
[1872.02 --> 1872.34]  Yes.
[1873.20 --> 1874.04]  He's paying attention.
[1874.12 --> 1875.00]  Play the latest video.
[1875.18 --> 1878.26]  I'll be able to watch that video and then I'll be able to just use my remote.
[1879.16 --> 1880.26]  And then back and forth.
[1880.36 --> 1881.38]  And that is going to be...
[1881.38 --> 1883.40]  That's huge for me.
[1883.80 --> 1885.80]  Hey, Google, play the hipster song with the whistling.
[1889.48 --> 1890.16]  I had to.
[1890.22 --> 1890.44]  I'm sorry.
[1890.54 --> 1890.78]  Continue.
[1891.92 --> 1896.24]  Hey, you don't want to leave those Alexa, play the hipster song with the whistling people out.
[1896.40 --> 1897.56]  Is that going to work, though?
[1898.08 --> 1898.62]  Why not?
[1898.62 --> 1901.60]  Because I think that's a fairly specific keyword for Google.
[1902.10 --> 1902.50]  Play?
[1903.14 --> 1904.36]  No, that...
[1904.36 --> 1904.66]  Oh, sorry.
[1904.78 --> 1905.50]  Key phrase.
[1905.72 --> 1905.92]  Oh.
[1906.02 --> 1907.10]  The hipster song with the whistling.
[1907.30 --> 1908.70]  Because they put that in an ad.
[1909.22 --> 1912.86]  And I tried a whole bunch of other descriptions for songs that I thought were pretty good.
[1913.32 --> 1914.24]  It didn't work at all.
[1914.70 --> 1915.66]  Oh, did you try the one?
[1915.76 --> 1917.14]  The Russian guy that goes...
[1917.14 --> 1918.90]  Does that work?
[1919.00 --> 1919.26]  Yes.
[1919.30 --> 1920.58]  We've done it even on WAN Show before.
[1920.64 --> 1921.46]  Oh, that's awesome.
[1921.46 --> 1921.76]  Yeah, yeah.
[1921.76 --> 1922.38]  It's awesome.
[1922.52 --> 1922.74]  Okay.
[1923.16 --> 1923.60]  Sweet.
[1923.94 --> 1924.56]  That's cool.
[1924.56 --> 1926.06]  I'm surprised that works, actually.
[1926.06 --> 1928.72]  That's a great song.
[1929.00 --> 1929.76]  You know the song I'm talking about?
[1929.76 --> 1930.26]  Yes, yeah.
[1930.26 --> 1931.96]  It's called, like, Seventh Element by Vitas.
[1932.28 --> 1933.04]  Get out!
[1934.72 --> 1935.76]  I think that's...
[1935.76 --> 1936.86]  That was my two...
[1936.86 --> 1937.58]  That's what I wanted to say.
[1937.58 --> 1943.90]  So, people in chat are saying that it's, like, basically a Shield TV, but in a small, compact dongle.
[1944.12 --> 1946.28]  But I think it does a little bit...
[1946.28 --> 1947.22]  Less.
[1947.40 --> 1949.06]  Wouldn't it do a little less than the Shield?
[1949.14 --> 1949.28]  Yeah.
[1949.28 --> 1949.30]  Yeah.
[1949.30 --> 1950.46]  And plus, the price point.
[1950.68 --> 1951.90]  Those things are over $200, aren't they?
[1951.90 --> 1952.14]  Oh, yeah.
[1952.26 --> 1953.96]  So, this is probably going to be way cheaper.
[1954.16 --> 1957.58]  The Shield will also be able to, like, cast games to your TV, which is, like...
[1958.28 --> 1958.72]  Yeah.
[1958.72 --> 1961.60]  You're in a little bit different of a range there.
[1961.90 --> 1964.22]  The Shield also has a voice controllable remote.
[1965.02 --> 1966.76]  The easiest way to think about it is going to be...
[1966.76 --> 1969.46]  There are already Android TV boxes.
[1969.76 --> 1974.68]  It's just going to be that with Google Assistant integration and voice remote.
[1976.04 --> 1977.12]  People in chat...
[1977.12 --> 1981.80]  I'm guessing that the price point will be, like, what?
[1981.80 --> 1982.90]  $120, $130?
[1983.20 --> 1984.50]  Is that how much a Fire TV stick is?
[1984.50 --> 1988.28]  Let me search the American internets.
[1988.36 --> 1988.60]  Yeah.
[1988.76 --> 1989.76]  Where those things exist.
[1990.08 --> 1990.62]  Oh, my.
[1995.42 --> 1997.54]  While you do that...
[1997.54 --> 1998.30]  Fire truck?
[1998.40 --> 1998.58]  No.
[1998.84 --> 1999.80]  They know I'm from Lines Tech Tips.
[2003.00 --> 2005.30]  What did you guys think about the Fire Pole video?
[2005.72 --> 2006.54]  Good God.
[2006.60 --> 2007.12]  It's $30.
[2007.96 --> 2009.94]  Fire TV stick with Alexa voice remote.
[2010.10 --> 2010.46]  $30.
[2011.30 --> 2012.14]  That's really cheap.
[2012.32 --> 2013.80]  Even the 4K one is only $50.
[2013.80 --> 2016.16]  A 4K Chromecast is, like, $70.
[2017.54 --> 2018.02]  Isn't it?
[2019.04 --> 2019.38]  I don't know.
[2019.44 --> 2019.66]  Hold on.
[2019.70 --> 2020.32]  Let me Google some more.
[2020.98 --> 2021.46]  Do it.
[2021.74 --> 2022.06]  Do it.
[2024.22 --> 2026.34]  You can get a Chromecast on Amazon now, can't you?
[2026.40 --> 2028.12]  Wasn't that the whole thing that they argued about before?
[2029.36 --> 2030.36]  Can you do it now, though?
[2030.50 --> 2032.94]  Because I know they're arguing about it, but I don't know if it's, like, already an option.
[2033.42 --> 2034.94]  Oh, that got pretty settled.
[2035.02 --> 2035.72]  It auto-filled.
[2036.24 --> 2036.76]  I don't see it.
[2036.78 --> 2037.36]  I see a Shield.
[2037.46 --> 2039.68]  They sell NVIDIA Shields for $200.
[2040.10 --> 2041.24]  It comes with a gamepad, though.
[2041.24 --> 2041.64]  Yeah.
[2042.48 --> 2044.04]  Because you can play Android games on it.
[2044.86 --> 2045.80]  Some of them, I guess.
[2049.58 --> 2052.96]  Yeah, I'm totally going to sell my Chromecast and get one of these dongles if it comes out.
[2053.12 --> 2054.60]  They're probably going to announce it at I.O.
[2054.64 --> 2055.48]  I.O. is in a month.
[2055.60 --> 2056.04]  It's in May.
[2056.10 --> 2056.62]  Google I.O.
[2057.14 --> 2057.92]  It's going to be sweet.
[2058.18 --> 2059.14]  Do you work on this?
[2060.10 --> 2060.58]  Heck, yeah.
[2060.76 --> 2061.20]  Yeah, okay.
[2061.26 --> 2061.78]  I thought so.
[2062.12 --> 2065.64]  So, while you're looking that up, I'm going to do a little floatplane moment.
[2065.82 --> 2066.48]  70 bucks, I was right.
[2066.48 --> 2066.82]  I have to.
[2067.00 --> 2067.34]  70 bucks.
[2067.34 --> 2067.56]  Okay.
[2067.74 --> 2067.96]  Okay.
[2068.04 --> 2069.04]  So, it is a little bit more expensive.
[2070.24 --> 2072.00]  Floatplane has awesome stuff on it.
[2072.10 --> 2075.30]  Kyle from BitWit currently has Cool Cooler is Cool.
[2075.56 --> 2077.72]  What happens if we remove the fans?
[2077.80 --> 2078.72]  It's a Be Quiet Cooler.
[2078.74 --> 2080.26]  That should be a pretty interesting video.
[2080.66 --> 2084.86]  Also, he has a 32x9 gaming setup that he wants to show off in a different video.
[2084.86 --> 2087.54]  So, Linus, Tech Tips has a wearable caouse.
[2088.54 --> 2088.98]  Caouse?
[2089.66 --> 2091.40]  I merged keyboard and mouse.
[2092.58 --> 2093.66]  It is a caouse.
[2095.40 --> 2096.28]  I like it.
[2096.28 --> 2098.44]  That was by accident, but I'm kind of down with it.
[2099.52 --> 2102.34]  So, can you tell me a tiny amount about what this thing actually is?
[2102.58 --> 2105.00]  So, it's these rings that you wear on your fingers.
[2105.16 --> 2105.34]  Yeah.
[2105.78 --> 2108.96]  If you lay your hand on a table, it's a mouse.
[2109.76 --> 2113.26]  If you don't and you just put your wrist on the edge of a table and you tap on a table,
[2113.76 --> 2114.42]  it's a keyboard.
[2114.86 --> 2118.26]  And it can know based on, like, if you stretch your finger or whatever.
[2118.86 --> 2121.40]  It's not spatial.
[2121.72 --> 2123.68]  It's not like A is over here and P is over here.
[2123.82 --> 2124.06]  Okay.
[2124.16 --> 2126.44]  You actually have to learn a bunch of gestures.
[2126.62 --> 2127.38]  Like, it's its own language.
[2127.80 --> 2129.14]  Like, that's A.
[2129.44 --> 2130.20]  That's N.
[2130.56 --> 2130.98]  Oh.
[2131.18 --> 2131.82]  That's R.
[2132.40 --> 2132.58]  Yeah.
[2132.58 --> 2132.92]  Okay.
[2133.06 --> 2133.74]  I learned it all.
[2134.26 --> 2136.00]  Can you type properly that way?
[2136.04 --> 2136.96]  I can type.
[2137.24 --> 2138.02]  How fast?
[2138.02 --> 2140.38]  I can survive.
[2140.92 --> 2141.24]  Okay.
[2142.08 --> 2143.48]  Like, probably dial up.
[2143.98 --> 2145.34]  I can describe it as.
[2145.40 --> 2145.62]  Okay.
[2145.78 --> 2146.00]  Okay.
[2146.20 --> 2146.94]  That's cool, though.
[2147.40 --> 2147.78]  I don't know.
[2147.80 --> 2148.08]  It's sweet.
[2148.22 --> 2148.78]  I liked it a lot.
[2148.84 --> 2149.86]  And it's good at what it's doing.
[2150.12 --> 2151.50]  Like, it doesn't register.
[2151.74 --> 2152.72]  I'm not going to give away the video.
[2152.86 --> 2153.04]  No.
[2153.22 --> 2153.40]  Yeah.
[2153.48 --> 2153.98]  Don't go any further.
[2154.12 --> 2154.38]  Perfect.
[2155.04 --> 2163.20]  There's also the continuation of the Apple fiasco with the iMac Pro, buying a video card
[2163.20 --> 2167.84]  without getting screwed, and some other cool stuff, like the history of the motherboard.
[2168.24 --> 2169.20]  I haven't seen that video.
[2169.20 --> 2174.20]  I'm going to watch that video, because I grew up with these super janky, weird motherboard
[2174.20 --> 2177.86]  setups, and I grew up with, like, my dad's computer, where basically to build the computer,
[2178.00 --> 2182.82]  you had to have a whole bunch of add-in cards, because the motherboard was so bare, and it
[2182.82 --> 2184.02]  didn't have, like...
[2184.02 --> 2185.36]  Like, you didn't have onboard NIC.
[2186.06 --> 2186.36]  Okay.
[2186.46 --> 2190.52]  You didn't have onboard LAN for Ethernet connection, so you had to have a NIC card in order to
[2190.52 --> 2191.50]  have connections to the internet.
[2191.50 --> 2195.64]  I remember when we bought our first computer, like, I remember being in the shop when we
[2195.64 --> 2200.52]  were buying it, and it was, like, for hours, and we, like, bought a sound card.
[2200.80 --> 2200.96]  Yeah.
[2201.02 --> 2202.52]  Like, that's just totally integrated now.
[2202.56 --> 2204.04]  It didn't have audio on board, probably.
[2204.14 --> 2204.28]  Yeah.
[2204.28 --> 2204.30]  Yeah.
[2204.42 --> 2208.86]  So, like, that, I'm 100% certain that that is going to be a sick video, so be sure to
[2208.86 --> 2209.26]  check that out.
[2209.32 --> 2210.00]  Check out Flowplane.
[2210.18 --> 2214.00]  You can go to flowplane.com and sign up there, or you can do it through the forum.
[2214.02 --> 2216.04]  But we are moving over to flowplane.com.
[2216.18 --> 2219.30]  And honestly, the payment system on flowplane.com works way better.
[2219.50 --> 2221.88]  So if you want to have less issues, I would probably go there.
[2222.00 --> 2222.28]  Get it.
[2222.52 --> 2224.40]  But it only supports credit card right now.
[2224.46 --> 2228.02]  We will be supporting PayPal in the future, but...
[2228.02 --> 2228.58]  Cryptocurrencies.
[2229.46 --> 2229.72]  Yeah.
[2229.86 --> 2230.28]  Crypto kitties.
[2231.12 --> 2231.52]  Kitties.
[2231.66 --> 2231.84]  Yeah.
[2231.84 --> 2235.30]  Well, you can get a year of flowplane for a single crypto kitty.
[2235.98 --> 2236.80]  What is a crypto kitty?
[2237.10 --> 2237.32]  What?
[2237.54 --> 2238.80]  You don't know what crypto kitties is?
[2239.60 --> 2240.60]  It's not even worth describing.
[2240.70 --> 2241.50]  It's, like, come and gone.
[2241.60 --> 2243.06]  This is, like, a four-month-old...
[2243.06 --> 2243.78]  Is it, like, a meme?
[2244.16 --> 2244.84]  It's, like, a...
[2244.84 --> 2246.00]  It's, like, a...
[2246.00 --> 2250.84]  Ethereum-based game where you trade digital kitties.
[2250.84 --> 2255.80]  You just Zuckerberg'd me.
[2257.08 --> 2259.12]  I didn't watch it go down.
[2259.14 --> 2260.16]  Are you telling me to zuck off?
[2261.06 --> 2261.84]  I just...
[2265.84 --> 2274.38]  There we go.
[2274.54 --> 2276.08]  I think we've completed our ritual.
[2276.54 --> 2278.14]  We didn't get to watch that, but I think we're in sync.
[2278.24 --> 2278.70]  I think so.
[2278.74 --> 2279.02]  A little bit.
[2279.02 --> 2282.50]  I noticed when mine was, like, going down that yours was going down at the same time
[2282.50 --> 2283.40]  and stuff, and I was like, mmm.
[2283.40 --> 2286.20]  I saw in the corner when you were doing that smile meter thing.
[2286.22 --> 2287.26]  Oh, you did the smile meter thing.
[2287.28 --> 2288.42]  Yeah, it was later than yours, though.
[2288.50 --> 2288.72]  Okay.
[2289.00 --> 2289.18]  No.
[2289.34 --> 2290.00]  As long as we did it.
[2290.00 --> 2290.94]  Do we just become best friends?
[2292.14 --> 2292.46]  Okay.
[2292.50 --> 2293.28]  That movie was amazing.
[2293.40 --> 2294.30]  I just have to say that.
[2294.88 --> 2295.96]  Let's get back on topic, though.
[2296.02 --> 2296.88]  Actually, no.
[2297.26 --> 2298.32]  Let's do ad spots.
[2299.44 --> 2300.38]  We might as well.
[2301.38 --> 2301.82]  Boop-a-doop.
[2302.32 --> 2302.72]  Synergy.
[2303.46 --> 2303.78]  Yes.
[2304.94 --> 2305.22]  Yes.
[2305.36 --> 2306.14]  Oh, yes.
[2306.26 --> 2306.58]  Correct.
[2306.70 --> 2307.28]  Synergy 2.
[2307.28 --> 2312.30]  Synergy is a mouse and keyboard sharing software, so you can have multiple computers, even multiple
[2312.30 --> 2315.96]  different types of computers, like a laptop and a desktop, and you can have, like, Linux
[2315.96 --> 2320.40]  on one of them, and Windows, or Mac, or whatever, and you can share your mouse and keyboard across
[2320.40 --> 2320.88]  all of them.
[2320.92 --> 2322.46]  It doesn't even matter which mouse and keyboard you use.
[2322.48 --> 2323.50]  You can even use a Kaus.
[2324.18 --> 2324.42]  Yeah.
[2325.70 --> 2326.10]  Yes.
[2326.10 --> 2326.96]  I want to make that a thing.
[2327.50 --> 2327.72]  Come back.
[2327.72 --> 2333.36]  And now, with Synergy 1, you had to have, like, one of the computers set up as a server,
[2333.80 --> 2337.58]  and I think that was the one that had to have the mouse and keyboard plugged into it, and
[2337.58 --> 2339.82]  then you had, like, all the client boxes and all that kind of stuff.
[2339.90 --> 2342.00]  All that's been massively simplified.
[2342.62 --> 2344.82]  It doesn't really matter which one you have the stuff plugged into.
[2344.92 --> 2346.12]  You can share it across all of them.
[2346.18 --> 2347.64]  It's, like, super simple now.
[2347.64 --> 2351.86]  There's SSL encryption, so you don't have to worry about someone, like, taking over your
[2351.86 --> 2353.06]  stuff, which would be not great.
[2355.18 --> 2358.24]  Just, you know, not good in general.
[2358.62 --> 2361.66]  You can even use a Raspberry Pi now, which is pretty nuts.
[2362.52 --> 2367.10]  They've fixed issues with reconnecting all the computers after one of them goes to sleep.
[2367.56 --> 2371.80]  They've fixed issues where redundant connections were being created between machines, which would
[2371.80 --> 2373.34]  also be not necessarily good.
[2373.94 --> 2374.88]  Things are great.
[2374.88 --> 2378.20]  If you have multiple computers, if you go to work with a laptop and then bring it home
[2378.20 --> 2381.58]  and want to be able to put it on your desk and easily transfer files from one to the
[2381.58 --> 2386.04]  other just by dragging and dropping from one desktop to the other one and just really nice
[2386.04 --> 2389.08]  seamless stuff like that, check out, oh, I guess, seamless.
[2389.60 --> 2392.82]  Seamless.com slash Synergy slash WAN5.
[2393.52 --> 2394.82]  Use the five.
[2395.58 --> 2396.58]  Yeah, it's important.
[2396.94 --> 2397.40]  WAN5.
[2397.52 --> 2403.02]  Also, speaking of Kyle's video on Floatplane, we've got Be Quiet.
[2403.02 --> 2405.00]  They're a sponsor of the show.
[2405.24 --> 2411.18]  You can check out their Dark Rock Pro 4 and their not as pro but still pretty cool Dark
[2411.18 --> 2412.92]  Rock 4 itself.
[2413.34 --> 2422.34]  The Dark Rock 4 and Dark Rock Pro 4 CPU coolers include virtually inaudible Silent Wings 135-millimeter
[2422.34 --> 2423.42]  PWM fans.
[2423.42 --> 2429.28]  It achieves a quiet 21.4 dB at maximum fan speed, which is actually pretty slick.
[2430.32 --> 2431.46]  Smells pretty good in there, too.
[2431.94 --> 2432.38]  Oh, my.
[2432.64 --> 2432.92]  You know what?
[2432.96 --> 2433.12]  Okay.
[2433.48 --> 2434.94]  Slight tangent while we're on the topic.
[2435.06 --> 2435.58]  Sorry to be quiet.
[2435.66 --> 2439.26]  But mouse pads smell terrible when you first take them out of the box.
[2439.36 --> 2440.18]  But anyways, moving on.
[2440.18 --> 2440.34]  What about after?
[2441.12 --> 2442.34]  They eventually...
[2442.34 --> 2443.20]  This is pretty bad.
[2443.56 --> 2445.02]  This one smells like a tire.
[2445.38 --> 2446.18]  Yeah, that's...
[2446.18 --> 2446.80]  Yeah, that's...
[2446.80 --> 2447.74]  I mean, it could be worse.
[2447.80 --> 2449.60]  I was expecting, like, the smell of fingertips.
[2450.60 --> 2452.14]  But it's not that.
[2452.26 --> 2452.56]  Interesting.
[2452.78 --> 2453.00]  Okay.
[2453.72 --> 2456.56]  It supports an additional 120-millimeter fan.
[2456.70 --> 2459.62]  Clips are included in the scope of delivery.
[2460.50 --> 2463.46]  There's a brushed aluminum top cover, which looks pretty nice.
[2463.52 --> 2465.64]  It, like, covers up the fin stuff.
[2465.72 --> 2467.22]  So that's what you see inside your PC.
[2467.22 --> 2468.98]  We can replace my face with it.
[2469.60 --> 2471.56]  Now I'm, like, the man with the apple in front of his face.
[2471.62 --> 2472.44]  Anyways, moving on.
[2472.90 --> 2475.32]  There's a three-year manufacturer warranty, which is great.
[2476.46 --> 2479.02]  And, yeah, if you need a CPU cooler, check them out.
[2479.02 --> 2482.28]  They're on Newegg and other websites.
[2482.40 --> 2486.06]  But we have links for Newegg, which will be in the video description on YouTube.
[2487.06 --> 2487.62]  Moving on.
[2488.12 --> 2488.44]  Squarespace.
[2488.70 --> 2491.28]  I feel like we haven't had a Squarespace spot in a while.
[2491.68 --> 2493.06]  But I'm here, so I'm happy.
[2493.44 --> 2499.24]  24-7 live chat and email support for your website, which you can set up super fast on Squarespace.
[2499.44 --> 2504.40]  You can save 10% off with offer code WAN if you want to check it out at squarespace.com slash WAN.
[2504.56 --> 2505.66]  It's $12 a month.
[2505.66 --> 2512.44]  You get a free domain if you sign up for Squarespace for a full year, which makes sense because domain leases are for a year.
[2512.78 --> 2513.88]  It has responsive design.
[2514.02 --> 2521.36]  So if you go to any device, like a watch, a cell phone, a laptop, a big computer monitor, one of those crazy wide computer monitors, all that kind of stuff.
[2521.42 --> 2523.96]  It will adjust your website to look good on all of them.
[2523.96 --> 2527.54]  It has commerce modules, so you can sell stuff through your website, which is great.
[2527.70 --> 2533.64]  And everyone can publish an Apple News format, which is great because that format can go into a whole bunch of other formats.
[2533.82 --> 2534.12]  Oh, cool.
[2534.12 --> 2538.08]  So you can publish blogs on pretty much everything, which is good.
[2538.32 --> 2543.00]  You can start a trial with no credit card required and start building your website today to make sure that it works for you.
[2543.00 --> 2548.28]  Again, check out squarespace.com slash WAN and use offer code WAN to save 10% on your first purchase.
[2548.42 --> 2549.24]  Back to the show.
[2549.68 --> 2550.02]  Boom.
[2550.24 --> 2553.32]  The beginning of the end of passwords.
[2553.86 --> 2554.20]  Yes.
[2554.20 --> 2564.36]  So there could be a future soon where you very, very seldom enter a password, which would be dope because passwords suck.
[2565.40 --> 2572.54]  So what happened is there's this new security standard called web often, like authentication.
[2572.80 --> 2573.62]  Often, yeah, the N on the end.
[2573.62 --> 2574.42]  That's so stupid.
[2574.44 --> 2574.98]  It's weird.
[2575.16 --> 2575.80]  Thanks, guys.
[2576.30 --> 2577.92]  I thought it was a typo at first.
[2578.28 --> 2579.96]  And then I was like, oh, it appears more than once.
[2580.16 --> 2580.30]  Oh.
[2580.30 --> 2583.54]  You didn't account for people saying this out loud?
[2583.68 --> 2583.98]  Okay.
[2584.20 --> 2584.46]  Whoa.
[2585.16 --> 2591.74]  Web often has one near final approval from the World Wide Web Consortium, which is the governing body for these kinds of standards.
[2592.30 --> 2595.04]  So what this is is on your phone.
[2595.12 --> 2598.90]  You're unlocking your phone with Face ID or with your fingerprint all the time, right?
[2599.72 --> 2605.48]  But you don't do that when you go to facebook.com or basically any other website.
[2605.58 --> 2606.12]  All recipes.
[2606.34 --> 2608.90]  For them, you enter in just a password.
[2608.90 --> 2616.74]  Setting up a biometric password on all different websites would take a long time.
[2616.74 --> 2625.52]  Not only would they have to implement that technology, but then you'd have to do all those different finger taps on every different finger for every website, and that'd be really annoying.
[2625.52 --> 2635.64]  So what this is, is it's an API, an application programming interface that all the different websites will hook into.
[2635.64 --> 2635.80]  And then you'd have to do.
[2635.80 --> 2646.62]  And then you only have to set up your biometric passwords once, and then the whole web can rely on them, which is going to be B-A-A-F.
[2646.62 --> 2646.64]  Nice.
[2646.64 --> 2650.74]  So for hackers, all you really need to do is break one system.
[2651.04 --> 2651.22]  Yes.
[2651.22 --> 2652.88]  And then you get all of them.
[2652.98 --> 2653.30]  Yes.
[2654.38 --> 2654.74]  Sick.
[2655.24 --> 2657.64]  I might be wrong, but this is how I think it works.
[2658.10 --> 2663.74]  Because I had to do some digging beyond just what was found on the forum.
[2664.10 --> 2667.42]  The forum post, by the way, was posted by Matthew Valencia.
[2667.84 --> 2668.56]  Thank you very much.
[2668.84 --> 2669.36]  Thank you, Matt.
[2670.18 --> 2671.30]  You sound Italian.
[2672.70 --> 2673.08]  What?
[2673.60 --> 2673.96]  Valencia.
[2673.96 --> 2675.40]  That's Spanish sounding to me.
[2675.40 --> 2677.84]  I'm really bad at that kind of stuff.
[2678.08 --> 2680.06]  So you're probably totally right.
[2680.16 --> 2681.08]  It could be really bad.
[2681.16 --> 2681.72]  It could be either.
[2683.22 --> 2683.62]  Yeah.
[2683.72 --> 2684.06]  I don't know.
[2684.18 --> 2685.48]  It sounds like it could be cool.
[2685.60 --> 2687.48]  It sounds like it could be a single point of failure.
[2687.72 --> 2692.44]  It just depends on, I guess, how they exactly implement it.
[2692.92 --> 2699.40]  You can require something like a YubiKey, which I think is actually pretty cool.
[2699.40 --> 2708.60]  So if they add power to the user in terms of like, oh, I'm okay with fairly weak authentication.
[2708.92 --> 2710.24]  And you want to go that route.
[2710.38 --> 2711.14]  That's fine.
[2711.20 --> 2713.30]  I don't care if someone doesn't really care about their accounts.
[2713.46 --> 2714.14]  That's okay.
[2714.36 --> 2717.10]  If you have one password for everything and you think that's okay.
[2717.36 --> 2718.26]  That's fine.
[2718.26 --> 2724.00]  As long as it's in your control to amplify that and have more security.
[2724.22 --> 2730.42]  If you want to go to like having two factors still, like a YubiKey and something else, that could be pretty cool.
[2730.42 --> 2734.28]  Well, you kind of already have a single point of failure.
[2734.44 --> 2743.92]  Like if someone were to get my phone, which they would unlock with a fingerprint, or if they were to get my laptop and unlock with a password, then I have all those autocompletes set up.
[2744.08 --> 2745.58]  So they kind of have everything anyway.
[2745.66 --> 2750.54]  See, but then that's an in-your-control thing because mine doesn't.
[2750.54 --> 2755.12]  If someone got my phone, they have access to not very much.
[2755.46 --> 2757.46]  They would have access to my email, which is pretty bad.
[2757.46 --> 2763.78]  And I guess they would have access to like my password Trove and nothing autocompletes.
[2764.10 --> 2767.80]  But they would have my email, so they could probably reset most things.
[2768.92 --> 2770.38]  But like, yeah, I don't know.
[2770.42 --> 2780.34]  But even if you're the kind of person who like doesn't care about things, wouldn't those, like how are they going to get a hold of your biometric information?
[2780.44 --> 2781.32]  Isn't that just hashed?
[2781.68 --> 2782.26]  Isn't it totally?
[2784.08 --> 2785.02]  Yeah, but okay.
[2785.02 --> 2789.04]  So there's different types of hacking.
[2789.56 --> 2796.08]  So you could find a vulnerability in the system that no longer requires you to use those.
[2796.44 --> 2796.74]  Sure.
[2796.92 --> 2797.26]  Yeah, okay.
[2797.36 --> 2797.56]  Right?
[2797.74 --> 2798.62]  There's a myriad of things.
[2798.84 --> 2799.08]  Yeah.
[2799.44 --> 2802.02]  And someone will probably find one of those.
[2802.10 --> 2802.36]  Okay.
[2802.80 --> 2808.42]  Whether it ends up on zero day and gets solved or whether it gets sold or what happens with it, who knows.
[2808.42 --> 2808.66]  Sure.
[2809.04 --> 2821.62]  And having one central system, if it's open source, and you have a whole bunch of huge companies working on making sure that it stays secure, could be really awesome and could like really lock things down.
[2821.62 --> 2831.38]  One thing that's awesome about this is if you're not even that savvy or serious about your privacy, you're more protected with this because you can't be phished with this.
[2831.38 --> 2834.96]  Because your password is like a secret that you know.
[2835.48 --> 2841.84]  And just because no one else knows it doesn't mean that they can't get it just by asking you what it is, which is what phishing is.
[2841.84 --> 2847.26]  You know, you get it.
[2847.34 --> 2857.62]  My wife actually got an SMS recently that was like, your telco has given you a refund or your ISP has given you a refund of $114.61.
[2858.14 --> 2858.84]  Click through.
[2859.06 --> 2864.12]  You click through and it's got tiles for each of the common banks in Canada.
[2864.82 --> 2865.56]  Totally branded.
[2865.70 --> 2866.62]  Looks totally professional.
[2866.96 --> 2867.58]  Looks awesome.
[2867.58 --> 2872.00]  And you just you click on that and it's like you enter your banking credentials and then boom, they have everything.
[2872.38 --> 2879.78]  If she didn't explicitly know like this ISP never texts me, they never text me and they have no reason to give me a refund.
[2880.22 --> 2881.54]  But like how tempting is that?
[2881.62 --> 2882.24]  Like, oh, free money.
[2882.38 --> 2882.82]  Free money.
[2883.14 --> 2883.32]  Yeah.
[2883.40 --> 2884.10]  Anything's possible.
[2884.24 --> 2884.50]  SMS.
[2885.12 --> 2885.64]  Log in.
[2885.90 --> 2887.16]  People get phished all the time.
[2887.18 --> 2888.68]  So you can't get phished with this.
[2892.60 --> 2893.94]  You still totally could.
[2893.94 --> 2901.72]  Because it would just be done in a different way because you would have to have it capture your authentication, I guess.
[2902.42 --> 2905.66]  So because you're saying this is a general API for everyone, right?
[2906.04 --> 2912.36]  So they would be so you would go to the phishing site and it would be like scan your fingerprint and you'd be like click.
[2912.36 --> 2921.84]  Like when you have to when you get like it on Android or iOS, when you get a permission prompt that was like share your fingerprint with this website.
[2922.08 --> 2923.20]  And you'd be like, that's weird.
[2923.28 --> 2923.96]  I already did that.
[2924.28 --> 2927.36]  And then even if you did say yes to that, they'd scan your fingerprint.
[2927.48 --> 2930.72]  It would just be once, which may not be enough to like totally get.
[2930.92 --> 2932.74]  See, but it may not be enough.
[2933.10 --> 2933.44]  I don't know.
[2933.52 --> 2934.90]  It's still might work.
[2934.96 --> 2935.64]  It's potential.
[2935.64 --> 2939.52]  You could also algorithm it out to like angle it slightly to try to make it slightly different.
[2940.18 --> 2946.84]  And honestly, I would honestly think most people would go like, oh, yeah, go away to any prompt that's like, do you want to share this with the website?
[2947.04 --> 2947.16]  Could be.
[2947.86 --> 2949.68]  It's still possible.
[2950.30 --> 2955.78]  There's phishing attempts that succeed that are super garbage all the time.
[2955.78 --> 2966.98]  And there's actually some people who intentionally make things like phishing attempts that are really bad because they don't want to get savvy people.
[2967.98 --> 2968.00]  Oh.
[2968.60 --> 2973.32]  So they actually weed out savvy people by making it fairly obviously fake.
[2973.42 --> 2976.70]  So if someone does fall for it, they can probably get way more from them.
[2976.72 --> 2977.24]  That's amazing.
[2977.24 --> 2978.02]  Because they're really gullible.
[2978.36 --> 2978.44]  Yeah.
[2978.60 --> 2979.64]  That's amazing.
[2979.64 --> 2987.68]  The world of people trying to benefit off of other people is vast and well-educated.
[2987.70 --> 2994.04]  That actually is a pretty good segue into another thing that happened, which is this ransomware that asks you to play PUBG.
[2994.70 --> 2995.88]  Get this ransomware.
[2996.34 --> 2997.84]  It's like your data is encrypted.
[2998.20 --> 3001.46]  The only way to get it back is to play this video game.
[3003.22 --> 3004.76]  Like we're not affiliated.
[3005.18 --> 3006.76]  Just play it because it's awesome.
[3006.76 --> 3011.30]  Or if you don't want to do that, just enter the password that's actually written right here on the screen.
[3011.38 --> 3012.96]  So it's just like a joke.
[3013.94 --> 3014.52]  I don't know.
[3014.58 --> 3016.52]  Maybe someone just wanted to play it.
[3016.62 --> 3018.08]  Maybe it's a viral marketing campaign.
[3019.52 --> 3022.70]  It's obviously like bad and stuff.
[3022.96 --> 3023.18]  Viral.
[3023.34 --> 3023.90]  It's a viral.
[3023.98 --> 3024.58]  It's a virus.
[3025.08 --> 3026.50]  It's a viral marketing campaign.
[3026.50 --> 3027.50]  That's pretty good.
[3027.66 --> 3028.32]  I like that.
[3028.42 --> 3029.64]  I didn't pick up on that right away.
[3029.74 --> 3030.80]  I didn't even mean it at first.
[3031.74 --> 3034.72]  It's obviously like bad and stuff, but I think it's hilarious.
[3034.72 --> 3037.42]  I think this is very funny.
[3038.36 --> 3040.12]  Just play PUBG for one hour.
[3040.22 --> 3041.64]  And apparently you don't even have to.
[3041.78 --> 3043.68]  If you just launch the game at all, it just unlocks.
[3043.68 --> 3045.64]  That's what happens, yeah, when you launch it.
[3045.78 --> 3049.44]  And the or restore code is, and you can just type that in.
[3050.02 --> 3052.04]  I think it's funny.
[3053.76 --> 3055.44]  I mean, I'm not condoning it.
[3055.72 --> 3057.08]  It's not a good thing.
[3057.22 --> 3058.02]  All that kind of stuff.
[3058.10 --> 3059.50]  But I just think it's hilarious.
[3059.50 --> 3062.44]  I was like kind of hoping it was going to happen to me.
[3062.64 --> 3066.40]  Just because I was like, well, I guess I got to play PUBG.
[3066.62 --> 3067.64]  But honey, our data.
[3068.00 --> 3068.90]  Yeah, exactly.
[3069.40 --> 3070.50]  Luke, it's date night.
[3070.58 --> 3071.48]  Ignore that code.
[3072.20 --> 3074.48]  I have to save the pictures.
[3075.08 --> 3077.48]  All the family pictures are all super important.
[3077.60 --> 3080.04]  Yes, family pictures.
[3081.60 --> 3083.12]  My family videos.
[3083.12 --> 3087.72]  My family VR videos.
[3087.94 --> 3088.64]  Yes, of course.
[3089.30 --> 3095.72]  So apparently warranty stickers that say, if you remove the sticker, your voyante is warned.
[3096.94 --> 3098.32]  You know what I'm talking about.
[3098.42 --> 3101.32]  This was posted by Steve Grabowski on the forum.
[3101.46 --> 3106.40]  And the previous topic was posted by no one.
[3106.72 --> 3108.60]  Hey, Grabowski, thanks for the topic.
[3108.84 --> 3109.10]  Yes.
[3109.32 --> 3110.46]  Warranty void if removed.
[3110.46 --> 3113.08]  That sticker apparently is bullshit and illegal.
[3113.28 --> 3115.40]  So the FTC is cracking down.
[3115.86 --> 3118.86]  They've sent letters to six major companies.
[3119.04 --> 3120.92]  They haven't said who these companies are, but they're big.
[3121.18 --> 3125.40]  And they're in the sectors of their manufacturers of cars.
[3126.36 --> 3126.94]  They are.
[3127.16 --> 3128.50]  Did I even write it down?
[3128.96 --> 3129.70]  Yeah, here we go.
[3129.92 --> 3133.28]  Automobiles, cellular devices, and video game systems makers.
[3133.52 --> 3135.34]  Like, I'm pretty sure they're big companies like so.
[3135.74 --> 3136.16]  Yeah, yeah.
[3136.16 --> 3149.54]  So, they've sent warning letters to these companies writing that statements that consumers must use specified parts or service providers to keep their warranties is actually illegal.
[3149.62 --> 3150.94]  And it has been since 1975.
[3151.74 --> 3156.50]  And we've kind of always sort of known this, to be completely honest.
[3156.54 --> 3157.10]  I didn't.
[3157.10 --> 3158.10]  Okay, okay.
[3158.58 --> 3160.96]  But it's been so, ah, okay.
[3161.20 --> 3162.82]  Maybe I shouldn't say we have.
[3162.98 --> 3167.66]  But, like, a lot of people have been on this side and kind of known this for a long time.
[3168.10 --> 3173.52]  But, that being said, because there hasn't been a big public statement that's super easy to point at like this.
[3173.86 --> 3176.06]  There is, you can point at, like, really old laws and whatever.
[3176.06 --> 3181.66]  But, most companies just act on the idea that it is enforceable.
[3181.92 --> 3187.28]  So, we'll make it a nightmare to actually get your stuff repaired to the point where it's not worth it.
[3187.78 --> 3198.44]  I think even if the case was that, like, you know, I'm going to take the sticker off and there's nothing the company can do and they're going to have to honor the warranty anyway.
[3199.02 --> 3205.72]  Just the fact that they have the sticker on there and are deterring a large part of the population, even that is getting cracked down on right now.
[3205.72 --> 3206.42]  Which is good.
[3206.66 --> 3211.70]  Because that sticker, like, you're right, deters a huge percentage of the population, basically almost everyone.
[3212.04 --> 3215.76]  And then, even if it doesn't, like, I love breaking those stickers.
[3216.24 --> 3221.62]  If I did want a warranty repair for something that I broke the sticker on, it would be a nightmare.
[3221.92 --> 3223.62]  And probably not worth my time.
[3223.72 --> 3225.18]  And it would probably never end up happening.
[3225.34 --> 3229.26]  And to get it fixed, I'd probably have to take them to court, which is not going to be worth it.
[3229.50 --> 3231.70]  So, this being enacted is awesome.
[3231.84 --> 3232.26]  I love it.
[3232.32 --> 3232.70]  It's great.
[3232.80 --> 3233.24]  This is good.
[3233.24 --> 3240.84]  One quote that I like here is from Thomas B. Paul, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
[3241.00 --> 3248.98]  He said, provisions that tie warranty coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both consumers who pay more for them,
[3249.08 --> 3253.10]  as well as the small businesses who offer competing products and services.
[3253.10 --> 3261.04]  You know, like, if there's a, say, a Mac store that's not Mac certified, but the people there, they know how to fix them.
[3261.84 --> 3264.24]  Those people should be able to start businesses and fix up these computers.
[3264.70 --> 3264.82]  Yeah.
[3265.40 --> 3266.42]  I completely agree.
[3266.50 --> 3267.16]  The right to repair.
[3267.42 --> 3267.78]  You know?
[3268.34 --> 3270.14]  Let's not waste as much stuff.
[3270.74 --> 3271.70]  Sounds good to me.
[3272.70 --> 3273.26]  HomePod.
[3273.26 --> 3273.70]  HomePod.
[3275.62 --> 3276.06]  HomePod.
[3276.12 --> 3276.34]  Okay.
[3276.34 --> 3277.28]  No, I mean, like, let's do that one next.
[3277.28 --> 3277.66]  No, I know.
[3277.78 --> 3278.36]  Let's do it.
[3278.42 --> 3278.86]  I'm down.
[3280.12 --> 3281.58]  This is interesting.
[3281.84 --> 3282.60]  Apple hasn't been...
[3282.60 --> 3287.00]  What's the last thing that Apple released that was a new product?
[3288.42 --> 3288.66]  AirPods?
[3289.98 --> 3290.34]  Okay.
[3290.52 --> 3290.74]  Yeah.
[3290.90 --> 3292.00]  No, you got me immediately.
[3292.28 --> 3293.80]  Well, that goes out the window.
[3294.24 --> 3297.54]  I was thinking, like, their watch hasn't done very well.
[3297.90 --> 3299.40]  Their HomePod now hasn't done very well.
[3299.46 --> 3299.92]  But you're right.
[3300.08 --> 3301.00]  AirPods have done great.
[3301.12 --> 3301.48]  But they're...
[3301.48 --> 3301.70]  Okay.
[3301.86 --> 3303.00]  They are still just headphones.
[3303.14 --> 3304.00]  Well, the watch gained steam.
[3304.76 --> 3305.64]  Has gained steam.
[3305.64 --> 3306.26]  Gained steam?
[3306.36 --> 3306.70]  It has?
[3306.88 --> 3307.34]  Yeah, yeah.
[3307.48 --> 3307.70]  Okay.
[3307.84 --> 3309.56]  Everyone knows it's the best smartwatch out there.
[3309.58 --> 3310.40]  I mean, it's not saying a lot.
[3310.40 --> 3310.64]  Okay.
[3310.64 --> 3311.68]  But do people care about...
[3311.68 --> 3312.14]  Yeah, exactly.
[3312.24 --> 3313.44]  Do people care about smartwatches?
[3313.54 --> 3313.76]  No, no.
[3313.82 --> 3316.44]  The category is still pretty niche.
[3317.24 --> 3319.10]  So here's the story with the HomePods.
[3319.10 --> 3322.32]  But when they was...
[3322.32 --> 3329.32]  When the pre-orders went out that weekend, the sales of the pre-orders there for the HomePod
[3329.32 --> 3332.90]  accounted for 73% of all smart speaker sales that weekend.
[3332.90 --> 3338.08]  And for the first month, I believe it was 10% of the market.
[3338.92 --> 3344.02]  Basically, the market share of HomePod relative to other smart speakers like the Amazon Echo
[3344.02 --> 3349.26]  and Google Home is abysmal and shrinking at a depressing rate.
[3351.34 --> 3353.50]  At first, it looked like the HomePod might be a hit.
[3353.60 --> 3354.36]  Pre-orders were strong.
[3354.44 --> 3358.92]  And in the last week of January, it grabbed about a third of the US smart speaker market
[3358.92 --> 3359.98]  in unit sales.
[3359.98 --> 3363.52]  But by the time HomePod arrived in stores, sales were tanking.
[3363.98 --> 3367.38]  During the first 10 weeks, they had 10% of the smart speaker market.
[3367.38 --> 3372.06]  But three weeks after launch, sales slipped to about 4%.
[3372.06 --> 3375.56]  It didn't help that they missed the entire holiday season.
[3376.12 --> 3380.44]  And that when they did ship, they were missing two critical features that they're going to
[3380.44 --> 3384.74]  have to wait for Apple Airplay 2 before they have, which is going to be like July or something.
[3385.52 --> 3391.60]  All that notwithstanding, the end result here is that Apple has actually slashed the quantity
[3391.60 --> 3393.68]  that they're ordering from their suppliers now.
[3393.86 --> 3396.78]  From 500,000 units to 200,000 units.
[3397.38 --> 3403.00]  And the people who are working, like anecdotally, I guess, the employees at Apple stores are
[3403.00 --> 3405.64]  saying that like, yeah, we sell like 10 of these a day.
[3406.04 --> 3407.88]  Like they're not really flying off the shelf.
[3408.52 --> 3413.40]  Which is interesting because at quite a few stores, 10 a day would be pretty good.
[3413.56 --> 3414.56]  So I don't know what...
[3414.56 --> 3415.30]  Yeah, who said that?
[3415.36 --> 3419.56]  Because if that was at Pacific Center, like in Vancouver, it's like, damn.
[3419.86 --> 3421.20]  They probably sell like 10 iPhones a day.
[3421.34 --> 3422.62]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3422.62 --> 3428.12]  But yeah, and like, yeah, there's a little Apple section of the local Best Buy.
[3428.54 --> 3432.42]  And like if they sold 10 home pods a day, they'd be so stoked.
[3432.42 --> 3432.62]  We need backup!
[3433.08 --> 3434.48]  We're doing amazing!
[3434.76 --> 3435.66]  These are record sales!
[3435.68 --> 3436.98]  Collars and ties would be undone.
[3437.12 --> 3438.14]  Like sleeves would be rolled up.
[3438.24 --> 3438.90]  Like, gah!
[3439.88 --> 3440.32]  Goodbye.
[3440.32 --> 3442.00]  People are getting trampled.
[3442.36 --> 3442.60]  Exactly.
[3442.60 --> 3443.66]  There's nine people in here.
[3443.86 --> 3448.88]  So it really like, I don't know, if they have 10 customers a day at that Apple thing, they're stoked.
[3449.08 --> 3453.84]  So like, it depends on the scale of where you're dealing with.
[3453.96 --> 3456.04]  But essentially, they're not selling very well.
[3456.32 --> 3457.88]  So there's a rumor here.
[3458.00 --> 3459.22]  I believe it's just a rumor.
[3459.92 --> 3461.08]  I mean, it's definitely just a rumor.
[3461.16 --> 3464.10]  I just don't know how like authoritative that rumor is.
[3464.10 --> 3468.14]  But people are saying that Apple could be considering making a smaller HomePod.
[3469.46 --> 3470.78]  I guess it would be cheaper.
[3471.76 --> 3474.94]  Because I mean, it's a pretty competitive market.
[3475.60 --> 3475.76]  Yeah.
[3476.94 --> 3482.18]  This isn't a Bluetooth speaker, but Bluetooth speakers are totally, totally commodity by now.
[3482.80 --> 3488.60]  And the thing with smart speakers is Apple is the only one that's not decoupled from their own proprietary device.
[3488.60 --> 3494.12]  Like, you can get Sonos to have, or you will be soon, Sonos to have Google Assistant in them.
[3494.44 --> 3494.58]  Yeah.
[3494.60 --> 3496.06]  You can get Sonos to have Alexa in them.
[3496.26 --> 3500.66]  There's some devices that have Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant in them.
[3500.84 --> 3501.66]  Oh, I actually didn't know that.
[3502.28 --> 3503.62]  Sonos is going to be like that soon.
[3503.72 --> 3508.74]  And I believe there's a company that, I think it's called The Wand, and it's on its way here that does that.
[3508.96 --> 3513.18]  How cool is that to address Alexa and then address, oh, I said it.
[3513.54 --> 3517.16]  To address her and then address Google Home for whatever you want.
[3517.16 --> 3517.74]  Like, that's awesome.
[3517.74 --> 3523.44]  So anyway, here's a few reasons why I don't think it's true that Apple is making a smaller HomePod.
[3524.36 --> 3527.32]  And maybe I'll be wrong, but I don't think it makes very much sense.
[3527.34 --> 3531.82]  Because when you make a speaker that's cheaper, like if you think about the Echo and the Echo Dot,
[3531.94 --> 3533.58]  or you think about the Google Home and the Google Home Mini,
[3534.04 --> 3538.16]  the thing that makes it cheaper and smaller is that they've compromised on sound quality.
[3538.96 --> 3542.14]  Like, the Google Home Mini doesn't have the speakers that the bigger one does.
[3542.94 --> 3547.52]  But with the HomePod, that's the only thing that the HomePod does well.
[3547.74 --> 3548.64]  Is the sound quality.
[3548.72 --> 3554.14]  So if they got rid of the sound quality, all you'd have left is all the reasons why HomePod isn't doing well.
[3554.22 --> 3556.82]  You'd have a crappy assistant that doesn't do that much stuff.
[3558.36 --> 3558.52]  Yeah.
[3558.60 --> 3559.66]  So why would you buy that?
[3559.88 --> 3560.48]  You wouldn't.
[3560.78 --> 3561.64]  So it doesn't make any sense.
[3561.64 --> 3572.18]  I think if they are doing that, I think it would speak to the post-Steve Jobs Apple.
[3572.86 --> 3574.48]  And I don't know if they are doing that.
[3574.54 --> 3576.48]  And if they're not, I think that would make more sense.
[3576.56 --> 3578.10]  So I'm not saying this is necessarily what's happening.
[3578.10 --> 3584.44]  But old Apple with Steve Jobs, not old, old Apple without him or older Apple with him.
[3584.68 --> 3588.46]  I mean, like the third one, not the fourth one that we're currently in.
[3590.22 --> 3594.92]  They would have demanded, no, this is the right way to do it.
[3595.22 --> 3599.44]  If they make something, they would have been like, no, this is what people should have.
[3599.74 --> 3603.32]  And people will learn that we're right eventually or whatever.
[3603.32 --> 3606.98]  And everything that they would make would make tons of money and make sense.
[3607.32 --> 3610.32]  And even if it didn't sell a huge amount the first time they made it,
[3610.66 --> 3613.32]  they would just make another one, which is a linear improvement.
[3613.78 --> 3614.96]  And just move on from there.
[3615.30 --> 3618.58]  I think you can categorize that by eras and attribute it to Steve Jobs.
[3618.64 --> 3624.48]  But I think a lot of it is more attributed to just the maturation of that particular market category.
[3625.08 --> 3630.30]  And now there's lots of different iPhones because the smartphone market is just way more mature.
[3630.30 --> 3634.54]  And in terms of speakers, though, their market strategy now is like,
[3634.88 --> 3638.06]  we're a hardware company whose principal product, the smartphone,
[3638.36 --> 3640.90]  is under attack at all sides and being commoditized.
[3641.12 --> 3644.34]  So what we're going to do instead, because we can't get more iPhone customers,
[3644.72 --> 3647.62]  is we're just going to get more money from our existing customers
[3647.62 --> 3653.80]  through all these kind of ancillary products like AirPods and the HomePod.
[3654.06 --> 3656.28]  So we're going to make a speaker that's really good.
[3656.34 --> 3659.66]  And we're going to get another $350 from each of our existing customers.
[3659.66 --> 3660.18]  That's wicked.
[3660.76 --> 3662.22]  I don't think they're going to compromise on that.
[3662.46 --> 3664.74]  I don't think they're going to say, you know what?
[3664.96 --> 3667.20]  Instead of getting $350 from our customers,
[3667.26 --> 3670.84]  we're going to get $150 with this like weak-ass HomePod.
[3671.08 --> 3671.34]  Yeah.
[3671.48 --> 3673.00]  Because then who's going to get the expensive one?
[3673.46 --> 3677.24]  It makes a lot more sense to me for them to spend their resources
[3677.24 --> 3680.92]  on making the HomePod that already exists more attractive.
[3681.60 --> 3683.96]  Why don't they just make it, you know, focus on the ecosystem.
[3684.60 --> 3687.72]  Focus on the integration with more smart home stuff.
[3687.80 --> 3688.50]  Make Siri better.
[3688.50 --> 3690.32]  Make Siri better if you can at this point.
[3690.54 --> 3690.64]  Yeah.
[3690.76 --> 3693.50]  And that's going to affect all your other products as well.
[3693.70 --> 3698.08]  I think focusing on the ecosystem for them is what they're going to do.
[3698.20 --> 3700.28]  That's consistent with their strategy that they're using today.
[3700.48 --> 3701.84]  I think this rumor is bunk.
[3702.12 --> 3708.46]  I think the first person to make a very personalized assistant
[3708.46 --> 3710.76]  is going to start winning me over pretty fast.
[3711.36 --> 3713.52]  When it's like actual conversational.
[3713.76 --> 3714.26]  Oh, yeah.
[3714.26 --> 3715.64]  When it's Scarlett Johansson.
[3716.14 --> 3716.62]  Like, sup.
[3717.40 --> 3719.72]  Like, you mean from, is that who did her?
[3719.86 --> 3720.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3720.52 --> 3722.06]  Have you seen Why Him?
[3722.54 --> 3722.94]  Sup.
[3724.48 --> 3725.24]  Why Him?
[3725.56 --> 3725.96]  Yeah, yeah.
[3726.04 --> 3727.18]  It's a James Franco movie.
[3727.86 --> 3728.26]  No, I haven't.
[3728.52 --> 3728.86]  Yeah, yeah.
[3728.90 --> 3732.44]  There's a virtual assistant in that movie that's totally, totally colloquial.
[3732.52 --> 3733.86]  Like, it fights with you and stuff.
[3733.86 --> 3734.72]  Yeah, perfect.
[3734.98 --> 3735.08]  Yeah.
[3735.64 --> 3736.26]  Like, I'm completely...
[3736.26 --> 3736.88]  Perfect.
[3737.08 --> 3738.04]  No, seriously, though.
[3738.14 --> 3741.00]  Like, I want it to be like, you're late.
[3742.06 --> 3742.80]  Wake up.
[3743.00 --> 3743.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3743.40 --> 3744.52]  And then when I'm like, no, I want to...
[3744.52 --> 3745.62]  Get up!
[3746.38 --> 3749.34]  And like, because it gets used to the fact that I have a hard time waking up.
[3749.38 --> 3750.56]  So it becomes a little bit more aggressive.
[3750.72 --> 3751.52]  So it tries to get me up.
[3751.58 --> 3753.46]  Like, I want one that learns who I am.
[3753.52 --> 3756.82]  I would honestly, mostly prefer that it was local
[3756.82 --> 3759.38]  and didn't have to call back to outside servers
[3759.38 --> 3760.66]  and would just use my own stuff.
[3760.66 --> 3761.90]  So if someone makes one of those,
[3762.14 --> 3764.16]  I'll spend exorbitant amounts of money
[3764.16 --> 3766.52]  and I'll make that work if it's, like, good.
[3766.88 --> 3768.78]  But they won't, so that's okay.
[3769.74 --> 3770.38]  But, yeah.
[3770.46 --> 3771.42]  Well, that'll happen eventually.
[3773.00 --> 3773.94]  Come on, it's got you.
[3774.14 --> 3776.34]  I mean, if we're talking, like, super long-term.
[3776.74 --> 3777.14]  What?
[3777.38 --> 3777.68]  Yeah.
[3777.84 --> 3778.26]  What do you mean?
[3778.64 --> 3780.06]  This is 10 years.
[3780.72 --> 3782.12]  10 years until you have a local one?
[3782.42 --> 3782.54]  Oh, local?
[3782.54 --> 3783.80]  That's actually as good as the other ones?
[3785.12 --> 3786.28]  Yeah, I'm talking local.
[3786.52 --> 3788.82]  Like, okay, conversational will definitely happen.
[3788.82 --> 3789.10]  Yeah.
[3789.50 --> 3792.26]  But knowing about you and dealing with you,
[3792.26 --> 3795.66]  the only data they need for that is data from you.
[3795.78 --> 3796.82]  So why wouldn't that be local?
[3798.56 --> 3799.88]  Because they want all of it, though.
[3800.92 --> 3802.06]  I got confused for a second.
[3802.12 --> 3803.58]  But it's because they want all of that data.
[3804.32 --> 3808.00]  So they can train the rest of their devices and stuff.
[3808.10 --> 3811.48]  And so they can take things from it for the most part.
[3813.36 --> 3815.12]  But, yeah, because they want that data.
[3815.20 --> 3817.62]  Ooh, there's another, like, let's get one more in here.
[3817.78 --> 3817.96]  Okay.
[3817.96 --> 3823.44]  Speaking of Google, basically, there's some leaks of, where the heck did I put this?
[3824.46 --> 3826.26]  There's a new Gmail coming in the next couple weeks.
[3826.54 --> 3827.86]  And it has some cool new features.
[3828.90 --> 3829.02]  Yeah.
[3829.12 --> 3830.94]  So data mining is profitable, basically.
[3831.60 --> 3831.96]  Yeah.
[3832.04 --> 3832.80]  This looks awesome.
[3833.08 --> 3834.32]  Not only does it aesthetically.
[3834.32 --> 3834.64]  Oh, yeah.
[3834.64 --> 3836.42]  It looks kind of cool or more Android-y.
[3836.86 --> 3840.32]  But it has this new feature of, like, confidential email.
[3840.44 --> 3842.72]  So there's, like, a little lock icon you can hit.
[3843.14 --> 3847.28]  And when you hit that lock icon, your email gets all these new properties,
[3847.64 --> 3851.26]  such as the recipient can no longer forward that email.
[3851.54 --> 3852.60]  They can't download it.
[3852.66 --> 3853.50]  They can't print it.
[3854.08 --> 3855.96]  Obviously, they can take a screenshot because nothing can stop that.
[3855.96 --> 3856.68]  They can take a screenshot.
[3856.68 --> 3860.78]  Or even if you somehow block that because of their native OS,
[3860.90 --> 3863.28]  they could just take another thing and take a picture of it.
[3863.28 --> 3863.46]  Yeah, sure.
[3863.68 --> 3864.10]  Sure, for sure.
[3864.18 --> 3865.06]  You'll never get past that.
[3865.64 --> 3867.38]  It disables copy and paste.
[3868.32 --> 3870.02]  And it lets you make it explode.
[3870.06 --> 3874.52]  So you can make the email itself expire after, like, a week or a month or a year,
[3874.64 --> 3875.22]  multiple years.
[3875.72 --> 3883.00]  And when that happens, so there are other services that have these kind of properties already.
[3883.28 --> 3883.72]  ProtonMail.
[3883.72 --> 3884.82]  Notably is ProtonMail.
[3884.82 --> 3890.68]  Now, if a ProtonMail user sends an email or a message to another ProtonMail user
[3890.68 --> 3895.52]  and it's an exploding message, when it explodes, it just disappears from both of our boxes.
[3895.72 --> 3896.86]  It's just, like, just gone.
[3897.40 --> 3902.72]  The way it works or is probably going to work with the new Google one is if you're the recipient,
[3903.14 --> 3903.96]  you're going to get an email.
[3904.10 --> 3904.92]  It looks like a normal email.
[3905.10 --> 3908.48]  You're going to open that email, and it's going to have a link to the confidential email.
[3908.80 --> 3911.82]  So when it expires, I think it's just that link that expires.
[3911.82 --> 3915.14]  And the email, like, line item will still be in your inbox.
[3915.38 --> 3919.00]  When you click that link, you're going to have to enter your Google credentials again,
[3919.66 --> 3920.66]  which is pretty sweet.
[3920.74 --> 3924.54]  Because then if someone stole your laptop and just had access to your email because you left it open,
[3924.74 --> 3928.62]  they still wouldn't have access to that confidential email.
[3928.80 --> 3932.06]  And you can also stipulate that they need to enter, like, a two-factor thing,
[3932.06 --> 3935.48]  like an SMS when they get that email, too.
[3936.90 --> 3938.78]  Just increases security.
[3939.04 --> 3943.56]  If someone steals your device and figures out your pattern or your code or whatever and can get into it,
[3943.58 --> 3948.18]  like we were talking earlier, like my passwords would still be locked, but emails auto-login.
[3948.58 --> 3952.90]  So if all my emails had this thing or all the important ones had this thing,
[3953.42 --> 3954.82]  that would add a lot of security.
[3954.82 --> 3958.54]  And you can make it so that the expiration date, like you were saying, it explodes.
[3958.76 --> 3961.16]  You can make it so the expiration date is, like, multiple years.
[3961.96 --> 3966.00]  So if it's something that that person is going to have to go back to it multiple times,
[3966.40 --> 3970.12]  yeah, well, you could make it so that the expiration date is, like, way, way down the line.
[3970.68 --> 3971.96]  It also says et cetera.
[3972.10 --> 3977.08]  So I could see a potential situation where it just doesn't ever explode,
[3977.22 --> 3978.84]  but it has all the other security features.
[3979.06 --> 3981.92]  Like you have to go through the link, you have to re-login, yeah, all that kind of stuff.
[3981.92 --> 3987.38]  So you could do it for just high security emails in general, which is really cool.
[3988.02 --> 3990.78]  It doesn't just have to be stuff that is going to delete.
[3991.24 --> 3996.38]  If you're an accountant, you could tell your clients, like, hey, send me your stuff.
[3996.70 --> 4001.10]  Just make it explode in seven years because I don't need it legally after that time,
[4001.16 --> 4003.14]  and I don't want to be holding your data in my storage.
[4003.34 --> 4004.40]  Sure, yeah.
[4004.52 --> 4007.34]  I mean, it wouldn't be theirs anyway, but whatever.
[4007.62 --> 4008.32]  I think that would be cool.
[4008.40 --> 4009.10]  It's Friday night.
[4009.10 --> 4011.94]  And speaking of Friday night, I think that's the end of the show.
[4012.06 --> 4012.90]  I'm out of Zuck juice.
[4013.18 --> 4013.36]  Yeah.
[4013.46 --> 4014.22]  That means it's over.
[4014.42 --> 4016.28]  I am too, so rip.
[4016.76 --> 4017.24]  That's it.
[4017.62 --> 4018.34]  Thanks for watching.
[4018.92 --> 4022.96]  Check out our sponsors, Synergy, Be Quiet, and Squarespace,
[4023.12 --> 4024.50]  which I'm actually supposed to do it this way.
[4024.76 --> 4026.62]  So we're going to have the intro now, but you can still hear me.
[4027.06 --> 4029.30]  I think the set might look different next week,
[4029.60 --> 4032.82]  but I'm not going to tell you why or how or when or if.
[4033.42 --> 4035.00]  So you can figure that out on your own.
[4035.00 --> 4036.64]  Oh, yeah.
[4036.68 --> 4037.74]  We're actually going setless.
[4037.80 --> 4039.44]  We're going to be a setless, paperless office.
[4039.84 --> 4040.32]  Oh, my God.
[4040.82 --> 4042.48]  We're going to be a VR channel only.
[4042.88 --> 4043.74]  You can meet us in VR.
[4044.84 --> 4046.22]  Thank you, Squarespace.
[4046.22 --> 4047.46]  Oh, man, it's not working.
[4047.56 --> 4047.88]  There we go.
[4047.92 --> 4048.54]  Thank you, Squarespace.
[4049.00 --> 4049.98]  Thank you, Synergy.
[4050.48 --> 4051.62]  And thank you, Be Quiet.
[4051.96 --> 4052.94]  We'll see you guys next week.
[4053.28 --> 4053.62]  Bye-bye.
[4056.34 --> 4056.90]  Oh, wait.
[4056.94 --> 4057.66]  We didn't do the thing.
[4058.00 --> 4058.74]  We got to do the thing.
[4059.16 --> 4059.62]  Oh, yeah.
[4059.82 --> 4060.14]  Hold on.
[4060.18 --> 4061.16]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4061.24 --> 4061.52]  Wait, wait.
[4061.52 --> 4064.86]  Hold on.
[4065.08 --> 4065.42]  Hold on.
[4065.58 --> 4066.24]  Oh, goodbye.
[4067.18 --> 4068.30]  It's okay.
