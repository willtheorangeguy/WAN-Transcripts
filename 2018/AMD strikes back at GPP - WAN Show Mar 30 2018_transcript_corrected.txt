[0.00 → 7.40] does okay mine does yeah uh so get wrecked welcome to the one show
[7.40 → 15.72] the good audio show yeah the show that as long as you do not have daylight savings time is still
[15.72 → 24.06] half an hour early heck yeah oh man we don't we don't operate in these confines
[24.06 → 32.42] of localized ideas of time yeah you know man like you know time is like you know really it's just a
[32.42 → 38.14] measure of like the sun you just think it's this time because the man tells you the man tells you
[38.14 → 44.26] what time it is yeah um so we're telling you what time it is it's when show time and when show time
[44.26 → 51.18] happens when a wizard decides that it arrives later whatever anyway macOS finally supports
[51.18 → 59.68] e GPUs over thunderbolt 3 nice uh the Enos model galaxy s9s apparently are significantly worse than
[59.68 → 66.58] the snapdragon ones which sort of um runs counter to what we had talked about on the show a little
[66.58 → 70.68] while ago where it seemed like Samsung was going to be nerfing the Enos ones yeah so we'll get into
[70.68 → 76.94] that a little bit more later what else you got apple releases iOS 11.3 to absolute critical acclaim
[76.94 → 80.58] no not necessarily we'll see we'll see later they're not necessarily against it either it's
[80.58 → 87.58] just not the most exciting thing AMD strikes back at GPP which is brand new never heard before news
[87.58 → 92.84] uh no one had any idea that AMD was against GPP at all let's roll the intro
[92.84 → 99.32] fake news show
[99.32 → 107.72] how much of that donut did you just consume like actually like half of it
[107.72 → 114.72] you didn't do the sponsor thing
[114.72 → 128.72] okay
[128.72 → 135.72] I'm fine oh man I'm fine everything is fine
[135.72 → 141.16] okay well uh we I think do we have to
[141.16 → 145.24] oh that's good I think that's the wrong lower third now this is the part where I smile right
[145.24 → 147.72] it is the wrong lower third now you clicked it yeah yeah
[147.72 → 152.10] oh dude I got thanks anyway I appreciate it
[152.10 → 154.72] uh all right so we made it
[154.72 → 158.74] the big news this week is of course about us
[158.74 → 159.62] oh
[159.62 → 164.70] we broke up with we broke up with tunnel bear apparently we have already got an email
[164.70 → 167.46] yeah from one of tunnel bear's co-founders
[167.46 → 175.18] yeah that is pretty upset um, um and I don't know I'm not going to go into I mean I'm not going to say
[175.18 → 179.40] anything that you guys couldn't probably assume but what I will say is that we stand behind
[179.40 → 185.86] everything we said we asked them for comments we gave them two weeks or three weeks two weeks I think
[185.86 → 189.42] we gave them two weeks to like I wasn't sure if we were saying that part, but that's pretty
[189.42 → 192.84] important in my opinion we gave them a couple of weeks to get back to us and be like
[192.84 → 198.12] yo here's our plan to make sure that none of this is a concern
[198.12 → 206.12] we did not hear back from them yep and um I've used Pia in the past we have other people here on
[206.12 → 208.66] staff that have been using it actually some of them for quite some time
[208.66 → 213.46] I used both concurrently tunnel bear I liked because it was just so fast
[213.46 → 219.08] it's really quick to get going yes that's true but then any more long-term installations I used Pia for
[219.08 → 227.94] so you know everything has a place and um Pia's place is in our video descriptions
[227.94 → 239.22] and tunnel bears is uh figuring out how to explain uh selling to McAfee yeah um I mean and as I said
[239.22 → 242.78] in the stream so I'm just kind of I just want to reiterate for anyone who didn't watch the stream today
[242.78 → 247.10] as I said we actually don't we're not aware of any huge problems
[247.10 → 254.26] that will arise due to this acquisition honestly we don't know that anything will change or go wrong
[254.26 → 261.26] or be bad or anything like that what we do know is that it gave us and many members of our community
[261.26 → 268.88] reason to doubt that things would continue to be status quo and fine um and that we couldn't get a
[268.88 → 273.88] comment from them for a couple of weeks so we kind of went well um let's let's look at the other
[273.88 → 279.60] options and being who we are it was not hard to get VPN services to return our phone calls
[279.60 → 288.24] you know knowing what the endorsement of our community does for a particular service they were
[288.24 → 298.82] like yeah we want to talk how's now how about now um so that was a big thing um and yeah so
[298.82 → 303.96] there's some there you know there might be some frustration on tunnel bear's side, and we're we
[303.96 → 309.08] kind of are sorry for that but the flip side of it is that just you know we have to when you go
[309.08 → 312.82] the internet moves fast when you go through something like an acquisition people need answers
[312.82 → 317.74] like right away and when it's something as serious as your online privacy especially with some of the
[317.74 → 323.18] crap that's been happening lately yeah oh yeah yeah tons like there's no waiting around for a month
[323.18 → 329.32] to hear back if the service that our viewers are using is like still cool okay or not yeah
[329.32 → 334.92] um all right so why don't we jump into our first um some f's in the chat for the tunnel bear sponsorships
[334.92 → 339.12] really yeah speaking of tunnel bear sponsorships
[339.12 → 347.58] f to pay respects, but you'll probably get banned by the bot so don't oh yeah
[347.58 → 350.08] okay it's only
[350.08 → 356.06] it's like it's only for 20 seconds at a time but look at that
[356.06 → 363.82] why did you encourage them why did you do it watching the bot just like covered in carnage
[363.82 → 369.74] just like it's not even a ban hammer I think they overpowered if it's a ban steam roll I'm not even
[369.74 → 377.18] kidding did the bot crash no wait no maybe it's turned off or maybe yeah
[377.18 → 379.36] maybe it's temporarily off
[379.36 → 390.42] all right um epic so okay let's jump into our first uh first like external topic for the day
[390.42 → 395.48] yeah this was posted by vegetable stew on the forum and the original article here is from mac rumours
[395.48 → 403.50] book looks a little something like that apple releases macOS high sierra 10.13.4
[403.50 → 411.58] with GPU support and this is actually pretty exciting for a couple of reasons uh number one
[411.58 → 419.54] is that I'm excited to finally be legitimately excited about thunderbolt ports on the MacBook Pro
[419.54 → 426.54] and on the iMac Pro uh because I initially saw the iMac Pro and went wow it's got thunderbolt ports
[426.54 → 434.20] that means that even though it's like a locked down sealed up apple product the most important
[434.20 → 439.84] part of it that might need to be upgraded within the next I'd say three to four years
[439.84 → 448.60] is the can actually be upgraded it's the GPU yeah so the iMac Pro if it supports GPU can have its ram
[448.60 → 455.16] its storage I mean with some difficulty of course, but it's ram its storage and its CPU upgraded to up to
[455.16 → 462.48] an 18 core processor up to I think it's 256 gigs of ram that's a lot which is a lot only four sticks
[462.48 → 466.96] so you have to buy like really high density modules but still you can do it but you can do it and
[466.96 → 471.06] then it's got I forget it's either one or two SSD slots but I mean honestly a machine like that's
[471.06 → 477.46] got 10 gig LAN you should be using a high performance NAS for your bulk storage anyway so it makes it like
[477.46 → 484.50] a legitimately pro machine I was so disappointed when I found out that the iMac Pro didn't support
[484.50 → 491.88] GPU unless you boot it into windows, so the hardware was obviously there, but apple had it
[491.88 → 497.26] turned off in macOS so it didn't support GPU unless you booted it into windows and I'm still
[497.26 → 502.52] disappointed about this one it still doesn't support uh display target mode or whatever they call that
[502.52 → 507.22] target display mode so you can't continue to use it as a monitor for your like next generation
[507.22 → 512.94] yeah iMac Pro especially because it is actually a really nice monitor so that would be nice that
[512.94 → 518.50] would be super swell but uh here let's have a look and see if there's sort of anything else to add here
[518.50 → 524.66] so the rest of the update includes um support for business chat conversations and messages in the U.S.
[524.66 → 530.68] whatever that see not being sort of immersed in the Apple ecosystem I actually don't know what that
[530.68 → 536.68] is me neither uh allows jumping to the right most open tab using command nine in safari oh boy
[536.68 → 544.08] okay safari is so bad you know the one thing that makes it completely unusable for me is the fact that
[544.08 → 553.68] it doesn't support favicons every tab is just gray oh yeah so I like I can't tell what anything is
[553.68 → 560.50] that's actually unusable for me yeah like with the number of tabs yeah you became a tab I did I was so
[560.50 → 568.52] good I corrupted I was so I corrupted him it's great like never beyond five I regularly use like
[568.52 → 575.72] 25 to 35 gigs of ram with chrome now I'm regularly yeah right you don't even have an ultra-wide yet
[575.72 → 581.50] either because let me tell you okay my work computer is a Walter right and at home I have three monitors
[581.50 → 587.80] so okay, okay you know what's up yeah yeah uh anyway so like it's completely unusable for me
[587.80 → 594.00] um what else we got here you can sort safari bookmarks by name or URL what are these updates
[594.00 → 600.80] these are updates why are they all for the browser display privacy icons and link introduces a smoke cloud
[600.80 → 611.74] wallpaper that was previously only available on the iMac Pro what is some more safari stuff uh okay so
[611.74 → 617.02] let's focus on the e GPU stuff because that is by far the coolest thing about it the most exciting so
[617.02 → 623.56] here here are the features you can connect additional external monitors or displays with your e GPU that's
[623.56 → 627.68] pretty cool so not only being able to connect additional displays because you could do that already
[627.68 → 633.96] but being able to drive them off of a different GPU very cool you can charge your MacBook Pro while
[633.96 → 638.70] using e GPU so that's pretty cool if you're into mobile yeah uh you can use an e GPU with your
[638.70 → 642.60] MacBook Pro while the built-in display is closed okay that I probably would have mostly taken for
[642.60 → 648.36] granted you can connect more than one e GPU using the multiple thunderbolt three ports that's cool
[648.36 → 654.98] yeah but any pc can do that to no I know but like yeah, and you can use virtual reality headsets
[654.98 → 659.14] plugged into the e GPU they don't have favicons I know trying to give them credit for everything
[659.14 → 667.00] i know i know like give them what they can get I mean knowing I'm sure I'm sure there are mac
[667.00 → 673.68] people in the chat that are like um actually Linus there's on the app store you can actually
[673.68 → 679.18] get this thing it's like 7.99, and it'll add favicon I'm like or everyone just downloads a different
[679.18 → 684.68] browser everything on the mac is like that there's like a fix, but it's like a 17 dollar
[684.68 → 689.38] download or whatever, and it like fixes some of the BS in finder, and you're just like yeah this would
[689.38 → 696.52] probably be free on windows yeah and Linux it would definitely be free um
[696.52 → 705.86] people are like next topic no okay, okay no, no this is a big deal I was actually getting to
[705.86 → 714.44] the uh sort of the the the climax here so to speak you can run an NVIDIA GPU on your Mac yeah
[714.44 → 721.90] properly in a supported way because up until now the only way to like NVIDIA has macOS drivers
[721.90 → 727.26] they've released them but the only way to run a modern NVIDIA card would be to be using a
[727.26 → 732.94] mac pro from like 2013 or something or to be using a Hackintosh
[732.94 → 740.46] thanks Bixby I really wasn't talking to you right now so i I think this is going to help a lot actually
[740.46 → 745.64] because like the macBook pros have been really popular for a long time especially for editing that's
[745.64 → 750.44] right and now if you can yeah do some stuff on the road but also dock it when you come home
[750.44 → 755.20] and edit more heavily there that's right I think that's actually really cool I think that's fantastic
[755.20 → 760.30] and I mean not just editing I mean you look at any GPU accelerated workloads you know whether it's
[760.30 → 766.44] simulation or whether it's rendering whatever the case may be like if you want I actually don't know
[766.44 → 770.88] if NVIDIA has squadron drivers for the mac so don't quote me on this one but if you had the ability
[770.88 → 776.68] to run a squadron on macOS and again I okay I don't know if like solid work supports it yet or anything
[776.68 → 782.10] like that the point is we're moving in that direction, and it's and choice is always good
[782.10 → 788.40] in the same way that if you are able to choose between AMD and NVIDIA on a pc it is good that you
[788.40 → 794.54] can choose between AMD and NVIDIA off for your apple experience too so that's the thing that I'm most stoked
[794.54 → 802.78] on um actually this is interesting we've got um we've got someone asking why is it that apple
[802.78 → 810.08] only uses AMD this is from near rata time I don't know I don't know what that says um people are
[810.08 → 814.76] saying no NVIDIA official support okay so we'll give it we'll give it a little we'll give it give
[814.76 → 818.76] it is a little bit more time for NVIDIA GPUs to be officially supported yeah I was just going to say I think
[818.76 → 823.84] that's going to become a thing over time they have to do the first step but uh well I don't know with apple
[823.84 → 829.26] you never know they may actually lock it down so something that alienware did is on their gaming
[829.26 → 835.74] notebooks the ones that have the GPU dock their proprietary connector on the back they actually
[835.74 → 841.12] intentionally locked out and I don't know if they're still doing it, but they intentionally locked
[841.12 → 848.00] out thunderbolt e GPUs oh, and you know it's intentional I think I talked about this with uh like
[848.00 → 853.70] an alienware 13 review a little while back you can tell it's intentional because uh contemporary
[853.70 → 861.40] XPS models worked fine with e GPUs and there was a specific error message that said that this is
[861.40 → 868.20] that that thunderbolt e GPUs are not supported on this model and so it is possible that they would
[868.20 → 875.58] do something like that so lets um let's let's sort of not put it past them but okay so there seems to
[875.58 → 882.50] be some debate in the comments here in the twitch chat so wish I was dead 1990 uh says NVIDIA
[882.50 → 889.58] does offer official support yes they do for their GPUs but what I think people might be saying is that
[889.58 → 896.86] apple is not currently supporting NVIDIA GPUs with their e GPU uh enabled macOS and I believe it
[896.86 → 903.10] would be possible for them to allow or disallow so having not actually tried it yet and right now our
[903.10 → 907.20] iMac Pro is still broken we have a video coming on that very long story do you know anything about
[907.20 → 912.58] this yeah okay very frustrating story well okay I haven't heard an update in a while but I do I know
[912.58 → 917.80] everything about the beginning it hasn't gotten any less stupid okay, okay yeah it's still broken it's
[917.80 → 923.96] right there are they still refusing uh the video coming okay, but it's I mean it's its right there
[923.96 → 930.10] right there that's a super broken dick screen on the front of it so um anyway understood
[930.10 → 937.82] apparently they killed uh thunderbolt 2 support okay oh sorry I can't, I can't uh will you discuss
[937.82 → 944.36] the proof that intel cherry-picks CPUs for reviewers no probably not anyway because wait we like did a
[944.36 → 949.80] video we showed I'll be your chat filter I got you man okay, okay I'm getting I'm getting triggered
[949.80 → 957.58] he's getting flustered yeah um where was I going with this right right right um no actually I think
[957.58 → 961.78] yeah apple e GPUs I think we're pretty good yeah yeah it's a good thing it's a good thing we're
[961.78 → 967.04] excited we hope I'm quite happy because i I actually think like especially you got us those blades
[967.04 → 973.64] hold on hold that thought yep why apple only uses AMD there's a big thread on the forum about this
[973.64 → 979.88] this week we had someone asking in twitch chat um my tinfoil hat theory I don't think apple's ever
[979.88 → 985.64] explicitly come out and said this is why we straight up will not work with NVIDIA but I think
[985.64 → 993.28] in apple's mind um NVIDIA still owes them like a billion dollars or something whoa um because do you
[993.28 → 999.22] remember that whole scandal back in, and it must have been like 2012 2011 something like that way back
[999.22 → 1005.38] when NVIDIA's again don't quote me on the exact year the exact model but I believe it was 940 MX
[1005.38 → 1014.52] graphics cards or 640 whatever it was like an apple only so I don't know if it was an apple only skew
[1014.52 → 1022.28] but basically what happened was NVIDIA was doing on motherboard GPUs for apple that because of um
[1022.28 → 1027.08] this problem with the type of solder and the way that it was soldered and the way that that machine
[1027.08 → 1033.96] heated up and cooled down they were basically um the solder joints were basically all failing
[1033.96 → 1041.04] like actually all of them and apple at some point ended up having to issue a recall, and they did not
[1041.04 → 1051.04] 860m people are saying maybe it was the 860m yeah so um apple and NVIDIA to my knowledge did not reach
[1051.04 → 1059.20] an amicable agreement about how they were going to cover the costs of that recall since then
[1059.20 → 1067.42] to my knowledge we haven't seen an NVIDIA based machine out of apple at all and so there 's's
[1067.42 → 1072.04] people talking about how maybe NVIDIA wants too much margin or maybe this or maybe that or maybe
[1072.04 → 1076.14] NVIDIA won't give them the supply or whatever the case may be I don't think it's any of that stuff i
[1076.14 → 1084.56] think this is just actually tech giant grudge match 2018 um and I don't see how they would ever
[1084.56 → 1093.00] resolve this because frankly both of them are fairly um maybe arrogant isn't quite the right
[1093.00 → 1098.76] word but I know what you mean they're both pretty my way or the highway yeah and pretty inflexible
[1098.76 → 1104.38] um you know I don't know I don't actually know they're both big giants that expect everyone to
[1104.38 → 1110.66] bend over for them yeah and like now they're angry at each other so, and they're both just kind of
[1110.66 → 1115.54] staring at each other nothing's happening yeah so i think apple would actually
[1115.54 → 1123.52] build their own GPU before they would put NVIDIA products in their products, and it's its not even
[1123.52 → 1131.98] that crazy yeah like apple has the money to shut out anyone and NVIDIA is basically printing money
[1131.98 → 1138.58] right now to the point where they have to kind of sit there and go yeah we don't need you we don't need
[1138.58 → 1145.66] Xbox we don't need PlayStation whatever we'll just we'll keep selling we'll keep selling teslas to
[1145.66 → 1153.16] data centres all day have fun yeah yeah and so as long as uh as long as neither of them has any reason
[1153.16 → 1159.14] to check their ego I don't think this is ever going to get resolved, and you even see like the way that
[1159.14 → 1165.98] they continue to behave with NVIDIA snarkily providing drivers for macOS your move
[1165.98 → 1173.00] I bet you that pisses off Linux quite a bit oh well I never thought about that
[1173.00 → 1179.96] rough uh okay well
[1179.96 → 1187.64] nothing that you or I can do about any of that no all right why don't we jump into our next topic here
[1187.64 → 1194.14] this was originally posted by diehard live diehard life I can never read that I got you it's to leet
[1194.14 → 1200.54] speak no never uh the original article here is from a non-tech and or diehard live maybe I don't
[1200.54 → 1207.10] know live no wait no I think you got it wrong I think it's diehard to live yes diehard to live
[1207.10 → 1214.80] yep okay we got this we got this we can read your name uh wow so contrary to what we thought
[1214.80 → 1222.30] earlier from actually also reading an article on a non-tech it looks like the s9
[1222.30 → 1236.60] with the snapdragon 845 actually crushes the Enos 9810 equipped phones in web browsing video editing
[1236.60 → 1241.14] uh photo editing writing
[1241.14 → 1242.10] I don't know
[1242.10 → 1251.44] wrong manipulation oh no phone benchmarks really are very confusing like you actually just have to do it
[1251.44 → 1258.38] by device because like look at this kind of stuff the uh the reference design for the 845 crushes
[1258.38 → 1266.54] everything in the writing 2.0 test yeah but then the s9 plus gets beat by a snapdragon 835 s8
[1266.54 → 1276.84] and yeah um okay but then a pixel 2xl is like way below both of them the Enos wins in data
[1276.84 → 1284.56] manipulation so randomly and loses in everything else I think yeah I don't even I don't even know what to
[1284.56 → 1290.12] tell you guys but uh basically they've determined that the Enos 9810 variant of the s9 is significantly
[1290.12 → 1296.38] slower than the snapdragon 845 uh the snapdragon one is available in Canada U.S. china Japan and Latin
[1296.38 → 1302.68] America and everyone else including Europe gets the Enos 9810 so they've identified the root cause as
[1302.68 → 1310.08] a very conservative scheduler and DVDs mechanisms so you know I was actually kind of uh I was kind of
[1310.08 → 1316.72] bummed out that I ended up with a snapdragon version and the intro is playing somewhere oh
[1316.72 → 1323.36] really yeah oh I started playing it for like a second by accident oh yeah yeah for just like a
[1323.36 → 1328.70] second and then i I skipped away from it okay it's my bad okay um I was kind of bummed because initially
[1328.70 → 1334.88] it looked like Enos was going to perform better but then now the snapdragon performs better and um
[1334.88 → 1340.64] actually oh do you I have snapdragon oh yeah but I had Enos last generation I think last
[1340.64 → 1345.38] generation that was better or something you know what I'm at the point now where phones haven't been
[1345.38 → 1349.28] slow enough that it's mattered for like probably about three years
[1349.28 → 1359.96] so yeah with that said my iPhone 6 is really freaking slow now like really slow I'm kind of
[1359.96 → 1364.40] tempted to go in and see if they'll change my battery okay no the iPhone 6 isn't that old
[1364.40 → 1373.74] iPhone 6 release date here we go two years 2014 oh wow bro oh well three and a half years ago bro
[1373.74 → 1380.92] yeah okay the 6s really was a lot faster too but yeah and like once you hit three years for a phone
[1380.92 → 1387.86] I find two years you start to really feel if it's really slow though yeah like terrible at a year
[1387.86 → 1392.22] and a half I usually start at a year to a year and a half I start really noticing battery problems
[1392.22 → 1399.86] right and then at two years I'm like there's battery problems it's also kind of slow things are getting
[1399.86 → 1405.08] at three years it's like okay I want a new phone bugs are not getting fixed yeah yeah
[1405.08 → 1415.50] all right apple releases iOS 11.3 yes article here is from apple.com naturally because nobody else would
[1415.50 → 1421.90] consider this newsworthy no i we I wanted this i the only thing I have to say about most of this
[1421.90 → 1430.68] is that it's pretty boring yes um we're getting new AR experience okay we got a straw pull this we got
[1430.68 → 1437.70] a straw pull the hell out of this, and it doesn't count if you were just like tooling around with it for
[1437.70 → 1446.08] 10 minutes okay I want to know who here has persistently used no you don't have to use it like
[1446.08 → 1454.32] all the time yeah okay have you know what like options for both okay, okay have you actually
[1454.32 → 1460.50] used AR but okay the reason why I keep on saying this is I'm sure a ton of people because we have a
[1460.50 → 1465.40] very interested tech interested audience yeah have opened the app that's not what we're talking yeah
[1465.40 → 1470.60] that's not what we're talking about we mean like some form of extended use not persistence I'm not
[1470.60 → 1476.08] saying every day but like you, you actually really like kind of got into it how about this okay so the
[1476.08 → 1482.94] poll is had you actually used AR okay cool we got no we've got tried it once it's lame slash not ready
[1482.94 → 1489.52] yet sure used it for something practical like, and it has to have actually worked like not a ruler
[1489.52 → 1494.92] application yeah where you measured a room, and it wasn't right like if it was is it was right
[1494.92 → 1500.10] and that that was actually useful for you that counts, and then we've got use it consistently
[1500.10 → 1509.00] because I want to know is anybody actually using AR I have laughed at one video of AR are we counting
[1509.00 → 1519.32] Pokémon Go no, no we are counting things that are being advertised as AR because Pokémon Go was more like
[1519.32 → 1527.28] pointing your camera stuff and then Pokémon kind of get inserted into the scene it is technically
[1527.28 → 1533.36] augmented reality, but if there's nothing spatial about it, and it's very old school style it's its
[1533.36 → 1541.96] not an augmented reality device that uses any kind of newer technology to actually embed the graphics
[1541.96 → 1549.10] into the real world it's just mostly putting them over top of your camera okay what about Snapchat
[1549.10 → 1552.14] Snapchat no that's not it fixes onto your face
[1552.14 → 1561.34] it does use tracking it's slightly newer than go in terms of the tech I know what you're talking
[1561.34 → 1568.28] about I know this still isn't it yeah that's really not it okay how do we define this that's that's the
[1568.28 → 1579.58] thing it's hard okay no guys I know it is AR I know it's technically AR but I think he's talking
[1579.58 → 1585.46] an application that is specifically AR focused Snapchat is more about sharing pictures that have an AR
[1585.46 → 1592.56] element you know what that's a great way to define it so I'm talking about IKEA's furniture arranger
[1592.56 → 1598.50] okay and I don't just mean you used it, and you put in the furniture, and you like thought oh this app
[1598.50 → 1603.30] is pretty cool I mean you actually used it like you went and bought something based on the experience
[1603.30 → 1610.94] you had with it yeah um or like a game that overlays itself onto a tabletop I'm talking an AR where AR
[1610.94 → 1617.46] is central to the experience we and we know Pokémon Go uses AR kit it's just very basic we want something
[1617.46 → 1623.38] a little bit more hardcore okay so no Pokémon Go and something that is absolutely AR focused okay
[1623.38 → 1625.92] someone in the chat ban all as
[1625.92 → 1633.66] let's get let's not get that confused that's like hurry up so I can click no
[1633.66 → 1641.44] look we're on it okay all right while you guys reply to that why don't we do our sponsors for the day
[1641.44 → 1649.54] sponsor number one I am eating oh so much maple buffalo bacon they sent so many packs of this
[1649.54 → 1654.48] with the latest don't touch my maple buffalo bacon you can have anything else you want
[1654.48 → 1660.52] oink uh oh you're going for the mojo yeah okay all right we did it we did a couple of weeks of like
[1660.52 → 1666.12] super spice i think we both earned an I think a little bit of a relaxing departure from
[1666.12 → 1671.78] that I've been eating this like every time I deserve nothing so no you had the huge piece and like
[1671.78 → 1677.26] oh that's true that like that was painful yeah so savage jerky is made with the best ingredients
[1677.26 → 1681.58] without nitrates or preservatives the goal was to create a snack that's full of flavour and spice but
[1681.58 → 1687.16] not bad for you, they've got 13 different flavours of jerky with uh my personal favourite being the maple
[1687.16 → 1690.86] buffalo bacon I'm going to cut you off for one quick second that is one thing to note have you ever felt
[1690.86 → 1696.64] gross after eating like a big thing of jerky yeah like greasy yeah have you ever felt that with
[1696.64 → 1702.22] these nope yeah no they're good they're not that's not in a thingy I haven't been told to say that but
[1702.22 → 1707.88] they're not greasy they're not greasy um they don't feel this one's greasier than most this one isn't but
[1707.88 → 1715.34] that one's not at all yeah um so great flavours uh mojo's great traditional is great um the salt and
[1715.34 → 1721.30] pepper one is great uh the maple buffalo bacon cannot endorse that strongly enough although i
[1721.30 → 1725.64] will say it's not for everyone someone tried it after the show, and they're like eh, but they've got
[1725.64 → 1729.46] lots of different flavours for lots of different tastes, and they also make a barbecue sauce a hot
[1729.46 → 1734.50] sauce a spice rub their carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world
[1734.50 → 1740.08] and they've got jerkies made out of those same reapers uh also ghost peppers and if you're into if
[1740.08 → 1745.74] you're into punishment savage jerky can do it I don't care how tough you are how spicy the food
[1745.74 → 1751.68] you eat is savage jerky can the singular person on the planet that I know of that is the best spice
[1751.68 → 1757.22] tolerance that I personally know of um who like doesn't have a sense of smell so he doesn't even
[1757.22 → 1762.80] have to worry about that part of it all that kind of stuff did okay eating it wasn't super great the
[1762.80 → 1769.82] next day because he like scoffed it down because it tasted good so like it's yeah if you want to really
[1769.82 → 1776.72] go for it, you can uh so you can use offer code LTT to save 10 percent at savage jerky dot
[1776.72 → 1784.64] com next up we've got synergy 2 synergy 2 allows you to share a single mouse and keyboard between
[1784.64 → 1791.32] multiple computers be they windows mac or Linux based they've got a brand new UI that makes the
[1791.32 → 1796.82] whole thing straightforward and easy to set up without having to know like the IP addresses of
[1796.82 → 1803.10] machines their new networking backend allows you to basically have it automatically work with complex
[1803.10 → 1807.78] networks that synergy would never have worked with before their SSL encryption has been moved from
[1807.78 → 1813.76] the pro to the basic tier, so all users can benefit from encryption their new background service runs on
[1813.76 → 1819.02] all platforms and lets users control all their machines before they've even logged in which is
[1819.02 → 1824.08] pretty sweet as well, and they've removed the concept of server and client computers, so users can now
[1824.08 → 1829.02] share their mouse and keyboard from any computer without having to reconfigure so check out synergy
[1829.02 → 1837.14] 2 at seamless.com slash synergy slash when 4 bringing us finally to the big controversial one
[1837.14 → 1841.30] someone just asked when it when is a savage jerky going to be acquired by McAfee
[1841.30 → 1847.40] I just thought that it's thought that was kind of is there someone equally evil in the food world
[1847.40 → 1850.24] Monsanto that we could what is that
[1850.24 → 1855.94] you have not gone down conspiracy rabbit holes I see
[1855.94 → 1861.58] no oh okay don't worry about it, I don't let's just keep you know what hold on a second I'm taking
[1861.58 → 1865.18] no I'm taking off I'm taking off the sponsor lower third we'll get to Pia in a minute
[1865.18 → 1872.86] okay they're like um so who are they I'm not super up on it, I used to be really well-informed
[1872.86 → 1877.56] they have something to do with um apparently nestle is evil
[1877.56 → 1886.00] literally everyone what nestle um they have a few things they're a giant company so
[1886.00 → 1890.60] there's going to be some stuff I know they were pulling water out of bc at some like under the
[1890.60 → 1896.10] table kind of rate okay, okay um that was like a huge thing up here for a little while their bottled
[1896.10 → 1902.84] water is like pardon my French awful like it is awful it's like the worst it tastes like
[1902.84 → 1907.00] pool water yeah like that you know that that that cheap one that comes in that yeah that
[1907.00 → 1912.84] the crinkly bottle the crinkly bottle that everyone rebrands, but that is nestle water it's awful it's
[1912.84 → 1917.22] the worst bottled water I would rather drink tap water in like but yeah you know how like the new
[1917.22 → 1921.92] York times said that bc has the most corrupt government of all of North America I did hear
[1921.92 → 1926.74] about that yeah so that was part of that whole thing because it was like super under the table and
[1926.74 → 1930.78] they were buying it for like essentially nothing just huge amounts of water apparently they have
[1930.78 → 1937.94] child labour issues in Ghana tried to buy all the rainwater rights in Bolivia yeah they're uh
[1938.72 → 1944.54] stopped producing the like water wars which are starting to just kind of starting to happen now
[1944.54 → 1949.22] people have been talking about happening for a long time they're on the front of that for sure oh okay
[1949.22 → 1958.80] yeah someone says they wouldn't even douche with nestle water okay that's a little far I think
[1958.80 → 1966.62] huh someone says la tap water is actually excellent and excellent is spelled wrong it's probably from the
[1966.62 → 1976.62] water sorry no offense we love all of our Californian viewers you guys are great
[1976.62 → 1984.28] your water not so great um anyway sorry what were you saying um anyway Monsanto has something to do
[1984.28 → 1992.62] with uh genetically modified organics oh whatever I don't remember to what degree um oh okay but
[1992.62 → 1996.82] there's like insane amounts of conspiracy theories around them, I don't know if they're true they might
[1996.82 → 2002.76] be true I have no clue I'm not informed I'm sorry um if I remember correctly at one point in time
[2002.76 → 2008.80] they were like aggressively pushing farms to use their stuff and trying to make it so that like
[2008.80 → 2013.20] wasn't seeds that weren't theirs and I don't know but I don't know if that's true or not so many
[2013.20 → 2019.88] unsubs unfollows so many for what oh the California water yeah yeah yeah look look look look
[2019.88 → 2025.92] we have the greatest water in the world we actually do we live in a rainforest yeah like sorry um it's
[2025.92 → 2030.44] just hard to compare yeah I'm just I'm I'm being an elitist, and it's not nice, and it's not fair
[2030.44 → 2035.34] please don't unsub and unfollow because um I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings
[2035.34 → 2041.56] did that sound sincere hopefully yeah because like I actually don't give a crap our water is
[2041.56 → 2047.08] better, and they should just deal with it totally yeah okay like some okay some somebody
[2047.08 → 2052.86] in chat is saying they sue farmers for seeds that blow into their land so like the wind kid uh someone
[2052.86 → 2059.10] else is saying Monsanto kills GMO seeds and sues farms for using their CI I don't I don't know
[2059.10 → 2064.78] there's a lot of stuff I don't know what's going on i just people don't like them I don't know
[2064.78 → 2071.64] okay all right okay all right all right so anyway anyway uh Pia so reasons to
[2071.64 → 2076.82] use private internet access IP cloaking hides your true IP address and your geographic location
[2076.82 → 2082.78] it allows you to browse on and browse that browse your brow keeping your identity hidden which is
[2082.78 → 2086.78] especially important for political dissidents journalists human rights activists etc
[2086.78 → 2093.88] a lot of that stuff's going on right now I'm going to China oh yeah yeah you should have it
[2094.72 → 2100.46] i I brought i I think the last time I was there I think I had like five or six installed just so i
[2100.46 → 2104.86] could like check which one had the best out connection you can avoid data mining and targeted
[2104.86 → 2111.24] advertising you can block unwanted connections you can unblock websites allowing you to bypass lots of
[2111.24 → 2116.74] government censorship and firewalls allowing you unrestricted access to more of the internet
[2116.74 → 2123.70] and you can save money so not only is Pia extremely affordable they actually allow you to hide well
[2123.70 → 2128.26] where you're from and browse websites that have different pricing depending on your location so
[2128.26 → 2135.76] travel is a key one here if you browse as though you are from Asia for example little interracial short
[2135.76 → 2142.42] hop flights are often much cheaper than if you look at them from North America little pro tip oh yeah uh
[2142.42 → 2149.30] I think something legally changed in China with VPNs by the way yeah I know yeah so obviously you're
[2149.30 → 2159.14] not using one when you're there no totally not I will check my Gmail by using team viewer to my nope that
[2159.14 → 2163.50] doesn't work I'm not doing that I'm not doing that oh yeah that's right team viewer doesn't work there
[2163.50 → 2170.78] I remember trying it last time yeah we'll, we'll figure something out um anyway you can connect up
[2170.78 → 2175.62] to five devices at the same time they have over 3 000 bare metal servers and 44 locations across 28
[2175.62 → 2182.70] countries, and you can yeah go sign up there you go there's your link pretty simple boom why is
[2182.70 → 2188.56] tech tips with dashes you want to hear something crazy yes um I don't know what the number's at now but
[2188.56 → 2193.34] the last time I looked at if it was like a couple of hours ago we've already had like 700 people sign up
[2193.34 → 2197.56] with our link wow yeah I'm not that surprised to be honest because I don't know I think that's
[2197.56 → 2202.50] there was a little bit of a response when tunnel bear oh well not when tunnel bear came out
[2202.50 → 2207.26] and told everyone but when people figured out that tunnel bear was uh being purchased by McAfee there
[2207.26 → 2212.86] was a there was a response and I think people were looking for maybe a new home um speaking of them the
[2212.86 → 2219.34] door new homes oh my uh oh I don't have a lower third for Ltd but Ltd is going to be awesome it's
[2219.34 → 2224.04] July 14th at the Richmond Olympic oval I'm actually so stoked he's going to be there absolutely I'm
[2224.04 → 2227.84] going to be there it's a LTT meetup and tech convention focuses on letting people get their
[2227.84 → 2235.12] hands on cool technology um oh this is cool uh tickets start at 35 Canadian so that's like
[2235.12 → 2241.62] 27 us it's not too bad as long as you can get here yeah you can check it out at Ltd expo.com
[2241.62 → 2250.86] and the travel yeah this is cool we have a booth list now this like just went up today I think
[2250.86 → 2258.98] yesterday what's this um we don't know how many k's it will be yet oh I didn't know what it was
[2258.98 → 2265.48] yeah no I know um and why would it be that long I don't know I don't know that's the blacked out
[2265.48 → 2269.28] thing right you should have a little blackout with a k on the end it also might not be there
[2269.28 → 2278.20] because it depends on so NVIDIA announced a new squadron okay like two days ago well don't people
[2278.20 → 2282.30] tell people too much and I figured out and well no, no it's fine it just like I don't know if they're
[2282.30 → 2287.76] going to send us enough oh so depending on how many of them because it's 32 gigs of ram on this thing
[2287.76 → 2294.34] so depending on how many they send we could go crazy town yeah and depending how many they don't
[2294.34 → 2299.70] send we could actually not end up taking it at all because one of our old squadron died at some
[2299.70 → 2305.40] point so we don't have enough squadron to run the old machine okay so it depends on NVIDIA's support
[2305.40 → 2310.92] whether we'll be able to have it there or not yeah um so yeah main stage uh this time we're putting a
[2310.92 → 2315.48] cage around the case toss because that was super dangerous yep are you going to take part in the
[2315.48 → 2321.24] key swap competition key swap keyboard key swap competition oh wow there's a real change to how
[2321.24 → 2327.04] we're running it this year it's going to be a lot more like prize and uh like event focused
[2327.04 → 2331.20] I heard about that i I don't think I'll win honestly I usually do keyboard key swaps when I'm
[2331.20 → 2335.92] like watching a show and I do it really slowly we're going to have CPU shuffleboard I'm definitely
[2335.92 → 2340.22] doing that too CPU shuffleboard I want to do like all these heat sink install race uh we're gonna
[2340.22 → 2346.84] probably have our multi-headed VR set up there just some oh a CPU deleting booth we're hoping to find
[2346.84 → 2352.16] a retailer who will like actually allow you to buy a CPU there that's yeah test it yeah I suggested
[2352.16 → 2356.98] that a while back and make sure it still works super cool be super cool uh we're maybe gonna
[2356.98 → 2365.22] have a LAN there oh I don't be yo clan so um intel has like a mobile LAN force yeah uh they are
[2365.22 → 2370.48] apparently considering showing up that would be so cool yeah so I've met those guys I'm sure well
[2370.48 → 2374.08] they might through the show but I'm sure they don't know me as an attendee but I've met those guys at
[2374.08 → 2379.50] packs for 11 years yeah, and they're super cool yeah I like their stuff, so there's going to be lots
[2379.50 → 2384.22] of stuff there, and we're bringing back some of the just like stupid carnival games like the bungee

[2392.92 → 2398.54] tubing bend right yeah hardline hardline hardline uh sort of tutorial thing so it's going to be great
[2398.54 → 2404.06] final it's going to be great it's going to be a lot of fun um I'm really excited based on how good it
[2404.06 → 2408.42] was last year plus all the improvements that have been talked about i I think it's going to be really
[2408.42 → 2416.66] good oh apparently the Pia link is dead uh like did the site crash uh uh uh no I doubt it yeah I would
[2416.66 → 2424.22] be pretty surprised um oh ed sent me a message something about reenacting something uh oh uh yes

[2514.02 → 2521.48] it was going to get dragged out so to speak oh, oh
[2521.48 → 2531.46] you know what that's my cue to exit um is that the end of the show no, no i just gotta go do some
[2531.46 → 2535.56] stuff if you want to go ahead and cover a topic or two on your own I'll be right back all right
[2535.56 → 2546.84] sounds good uh okay uh which which which oh man okay let's talk about that why not let's do it
[2546.84 → 2554.46] can I bring this up on screen I need to go on here hold on guys operating both laptops is no fun
[2554.46 → 2566.28] do there we go all right so we're talking about the that sounded horrible what the metal
[2566.28 → 2573.62] grinding yeah that's how you know it's safe try to only do it once more sorry okay that wasn't
[2573.62 → 2578.18] actually that bad all right Uber reached a settlement with the daughter and husband of
[2578.18 → 2585.80] Elaine hers berg who died after being hit by a self-driving Uber vehicle in temp Arizona the
[2585.80 → 2590.50] settlement presumably includes a cash payment but no details were provided by either Uber or the
[2590.50 → 2597.74] family's attorney also since last week people in temp have uploaded videos uh of which we can watch
[2597.74 → 2607.80] but doing this on his thing is uh not great so okay I think what they're doing is they're showing
[2607.80 → 2617.50] you guys can't see if it's it doesn't work way to go Linus also he sounds like he's dying don't worry
[2617.50 → 2622.08] about that he's completely fine uh I know that he's fine I know what's happening over there I can't show
[2622.08 → 2626.58] you guys but basically in Uber's footage it was super, super dark, and it was really hard to see anything
[2626.58 → 2631.90] and people are showing that driving on that street at that time of day it's actually not that dark which
[2631.90 → 2635.64] goes pretty counter to them saying like oh well the self-driving thing couldn't see very well
[2635.64 → 2639.76] it's actually pretty well illuminated and in some of the pictures it shows quite a bit of lights going
[2639.76 → 2645.86] along the side of the road which are not very visible in Uber's footage uh it also gives credence
[2645.86 → 2649.88] to the belief that an alert driver could have intervened because they would have been able to
[2649.88 → 2655.52] see much more easily, and it makes sense because headlight illuminates farther than two seconds ahead
[2655.52 → 2657.38] of a vehicle so it should have been able to stop
[2657.38 → 2664.94] that was the Uber topic left you to deal with the fallout yeah you showed up like right at the end
[2664.94 → 2668.80] of the Uber topic so we're good to move on to the next one also that door opening and closing during
[2668.80 → 2673.98] land show should never be a thing oh really yeah it's terrible oh wow all the metal grinding
[2673.98 → 2684.00] noises oh going into the mic sorry everyone we apologize we're really sorry hopefully this uh
[2684.00 → 2687.96] makes up this helps your ears too it's a little bit
[2687.96 → 2697.46] okay Amy strikes back yeah we can talk about if it's kind of boring though AMD strikes back Taiwan's
[2697.46 → 2702.60] Asus tech gigabyte and MSI are caught in a dilemma over the development and shipment of new gaming models
[2702.60 → 2709.70] as they are DSP members but also have long-term partnerships with AMD industry sources said
[2709.70 → 2713.82] that the three Taiwanese brands have reportedly adjusted their new product development roadmaps
[2713.82 → 2720.54] and they may also launch new gaming brands based on AMD's GPUs I mean I don't see that being very
[2720.54 → 2724.48] effective like can you imagine like what's Asus's brand going to be like
[2724.48 → 2726.90] republic of rhymers
[2726.90 → 2733.36] you know gigabyte a or u
[2733.36 → 2740.10] oh a or me I'm sure their branding departments can come up with something pretty good but MSI's
[2740.10 → 2746.76] branding is literally gaming yeah like that's what they call if it's just like g GTX 1080 ti gaming
[2746.76 → 2753.76] MSI AMD gaming i I doubt it I sincerely doubt it this whole thing just smells so bad and you
[2753.76 → 2761.26] know what's fascinating you can always tell when NVIDIA is in like full-on damage control mode
[2761.26 → 2767.54] because they say nothing they don't damage control they just don't do anything yep, and you know what
[2767.54 → 2772.40] it's not a bad strategy because it's going to work people it'll go away faster we're going to get bored
[2772.40 → 2776.80] of talking about it, we are you guys are going to get bored with hearing about it because there's no
[2776.80 → 2783.56] proper news there 's's no news the other side is upset yep if they said anything then that would
[2783.56 → 2788.24] be newsworthy, and we'd have to talk about it again, and it would actually create a whole new news cycle of
[2788.24 → 2794.12] of people being mad at NVIDIA but as it is NVIDIA can just kind of sit there quietly wait for this
[2794.12 → 2800.00] to go away and I think they're going to get away with it if everything that's been said about this
[2800.00 → 2806.92] whole program is actually true yep then that will be a problem uh SpaceX is apparently close to
[2806.92 → 2810.70] becoming an internet service provider, so the original article here is from the verge and this
[2810.70 → 2815.96] was posted by monkey biz this is new news over on the forum this is apparently not new news it's okay
[2815.96 → 2819.58] no dude it's fine we're just going to keep talking about it anyway it's still interesting
[2819.58 → 2824.14] and it's coming closer and there's been new information that's come out but like so it's
[2824.14 → 2830.64] satellite internet which is not going to be the fastest thing ever but right now is extraordinarily
[2830.64 → 2834.88] expensive and I guess there's a lot of room for improvement in that particular industry and if
[2834.88 → 2840.14] your whole deal is that you launch things into space then getting into the satellite communications
[2840.14 → 2846.48] business is probably not that much of a stretch so earlier this year they launched the first two
[2846.48 → 2855.40] of their planned 12 000 satellite constellation the company is starting out with a 4 425 satellite array
[2855.40 → 2860.68] and the FCC is requiring SpaceX to launch at least half of them within the next six years
[2860.68 → 2865.84] so SpaceX hopes that Starlink will become a big revenue generator that can help offset the R&D and
[2865.84 → 2870.64] operations costs for the rocket company SpaceX expects more than 40 million subscribers for
[2870.64 → 2875.20] Starlink by 2025 which would be roughly 30 billion dollars in revenue
[2875.20 → 2885.14] so straw poll for what sure oh right we've got to go back to the straw poll results oh we never did
[2885.14 → 2894.28] oh good call twitch chat have you actually used AR 62 of you say no straight up no not even tried it
[2894.28 → 2903.62] once straight up no 28 of you say tried it once it's either lame or not ready yet so essentially 90 of
[2903.62 → 2913.24] people so literally two percent of an audience that is hardly no offence hardly representative of the
[2913.24 → 2916.82] general mainstream population not armies use it consistently
[2916.82 → 2929.34] here's what okay like I get that early on in any technology it's kind of like land grab, and it's a land grab for like mind share
[2929.34 → 2946.80] here here here's the most confusing one why is apple involved in this yeah that's usually their deal is to wait until all the really like crappy stuff, but they've been acting weird for a long time yeah ever since Steve Jobs has been gone they've been acting really weird
[2946.82 → 2969.70] hmm okay well yeah so like the thing is someone could say like oh but Steve Jobs pushed new things to insert in specific realms and yeah you're right, but his first version would also be awesome I mean yes and no I mean the iPhone didn't have copy and paste
[2969.70 → 2976.74] no, but it was pretty sick okay yes, yes it was pretty the original iPad was kind of big and
[2976.74 → 2982.22] brick like thick and battery life was terrible, but it was pretty sick for its time okay all right
[2982.22 → 2988.22] all right all right so AR though like actually just not very sick for its time and apparently most of
[2988.22 → 2993.14] you are pretty much on the same page yeah that's what I mean like there's a difference in the feel, and it's not
[2993.14 → 2999.30] even just the percentages that tell the story here the use it consistently categorize is 35 people
[2999.30 → 3007.86] like yeah like, and you look at the millions of dollars being invested into this for I'm sorry how
[3007.86 → 3020.34] many actual like bodies that are using it I don't know man uh and I think in like 10 years and
[3020.34 → 3024.38] I'm not saying that's like the beginning of it being awesome I'm just saying in 10 years in general
[3024.38 → 3029.04] yeah I'm not saying it's going to take that long and this isn't a prediction of anything just in 10
[3029.04 → 3036.30] years I suspect it will be pretty commonplace okay this is terrible uh, so this is posted by run on the
[3036.30 → 3038.92] forum the original article here is from DA developers
[3038.92 → 3046.16] LG is apparently seeking feedback on display notches
[3046.16 → 3052.74] okay LG here's some feedback no
[3052.74 → 3056.24] no
[3056.24 → 3064.76] no we are so close like we are actually not that far away from being able to put these elements under the
[3064.76 → 3074.82] display anyway you know have the courage to not isn't it weird that we've gone from like
[3074.82 → 3081.76] apple products are really nice but over expensive, and they can't game so the pc people are like why
[3081.76 → 3088.46] are you wasting your money on that it can't play games anyway to everyone's trying to copy apple
[3088.46 → 3094.90] even when it's not working like apple used to copy everyone else and generally like to do it with
[3094.90 → 3100.02] really nice build quality yeah now it's everyone copies apple even though people don't like it
[3100.02 → 3109.58] I don't know apparently some people actually like the notch why I don't know maybe they never watch
[3109.58 → 3112.74] movies, or they don't want anything in their notification bar
[3112.74 → 3118.72] like I just don't get it I can't even tell when my VPN's connected or not
[3118.72 → 3123.80] because there's not enough room yeah whereas on the iPhone 8 I can tell and like my notification
[3123.80 → 3129.44] bar is maxed basically all the time yeah and I actually look at it exactly because like there's
[3129.44 → 3135.28] certain icons that are probably important things that I need to check and other icons that aren't as
[3135.28 → 3142.40] important I don't know um all right this is our last big topic of the day this was posted by
[3142.40 → 3152.48] siphon on the forum the original article here is from NPR really oh boy restricted by YouTube
[3152.48 → 3157.28] gun enthusiasts are taking their videos to Pornhub
[3157.28 → 3167.96] wow wow wow so that's pretty interesting um
[3167.96 → 3177.72] because guns are sort of a huge vertical on YouTube so starting next month YouTube is going
[3177.72 → 3182.56] to be banning certain subjects in the firearms' category prompting some channels to upload their
[3182.56 → 3192.14] videos to the Canadian porn site Pornhub instead banned subjects include selling firearms um just
[3192.14 → 3196.06] be really gentle when you close that the noise is like aids on the mic yeah that's good just
[3196.06 → 3202.36] leave it perfect yep um selling firearms or certain firearms accessories through direct sales or linking
[3202.36 → 3208.56] to sites that sell these items now that second part huge like dealbreaker yeah they won't be
[3208.56 → 3214.46] able to take sponsorships from gun sites or uh and if you take their ad revenue gun companies away
[3214.46 → 3221.70] and take their sponsorship completely away what's left and if you know the thing is that
[3221.70 → 3226.40] the one of the one of the reasons that this is happening is that this type of content is not
[3226.40 → 3231.74] particularly ad advertiser friendly in the first place so it's not like these guys have other advertisers
[3231.74 → 3237.92] banging down their doors and while they will maybe find advertisers uh whether they're advertisers that
[3237.92 → 3243.36] are edgy and you know more mainstream publications won't touch them or whether they're just they just
[3243.36 → 3248.34] don't really care what it will affect too is the rates that they'll have to pay because if there's less
[3248.34 → 3255.46] competition for uh sponsorships or advertisements on these particular channels then the rates inherently drop
[3255.46 → 3262.34] um any instructions on manufacturing a firearm ammunition high capacity mag homemade silencer
[3262.34 → 3267.82] suppressor okay well that probably shouldn't be a thing or certain firearms what if it's legal that's
[3267.82 → 3273.76] the issue right to my knowledge suppressors are not either in Canada or the states they're in states
[3273.76 → 3280.04] in the states you can get suppressors in some places why not that's the question I'm not
[3280.04 → 3285.38] necessarily arguing it can be no there's no reason for civilian to need a suppressor there is
[3285.38 → 3290.58] actually okay there are medical reasons easier on your ears I'm not arguing for either side I'm just
[3290.58 → 3296.54] saying there are arguments for why you might want one okay do you know how much that entire band of
[3296.54 → 3302.04] earplugs cost it's like four dollars possibly not enough depending on what there is and what you're
[3302.04 → 3308.84] firing you'd probably need over your prediction or both in some cases you could do both so do you know
[3308.84 → 3314.78] how much that over your protection up there cost I'm not arguing I'm stating what it is um they're
[3314.78 → 3320.14] also banning okay, so the accessories include those that enable a firearm to simulate automatic fire
[3320.14 → 3325.40] or convert a firearm to automatic fire and high capacity mags uh instructions for how to convert a
[3325.40 → 3333.70] firearm to automatic okay those are duplicated yeah um so in range TV which has 144 000 subscribers on
[3333.70 → 3338.62] YouTube has chosen to publish videos on porn hub and a search on the site yields five videos currently
[3338.62 → 3348.86] uploaded by in range TV wow um do you need something else oh okay
[3348.86 → 3369.46] what uh okay um all right so that was pretty much it for the land show today thank you very much
