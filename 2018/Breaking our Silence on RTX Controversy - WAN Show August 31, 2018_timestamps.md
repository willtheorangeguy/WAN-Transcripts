Here is what Linus said in the forum
"Riley and I have known each other for almost 8 years and we've worked together in some capacity for over half of that time. 

 He asked to review a graphics card as a total joke. That's not his forte and he's perfectly comfortable with that. Even back at NCIX Tech Tips (as he mentioned on the WAN Show today) he got Ivan's help with a lot of the benchmarking stuff. Big deal. 

You also need to understand that he's not some intern who isn't sure about his job security or his skills. Evaluating gaming cards may not be one of them but who cares? That's not what he was hired to do.

 Riley was brought in as a specialist for TechLinked. 

 Something you guys might also not realize is that Riley is perfectly comfortable dishing out his share of trolling off-camera - even if he's not sure where the limits are yet with the live audience. 

 If LMG was a horrible place to work and anyone actually took me seriously about this stuff, we'd probably have a little more turnover, don't you think? These are very talented people who could get a job tomorrow if they felt like it. 

 We tease each other, but it's part of having some fun at work instead of being all corporate. 

 I messaged Riley to tell him people were upset at the way he was treated on the WAN Show and to make sure he was okay and he had to go find the timestamps people were posting to see why he was supposed to be upset. 

 So it's probably worthwhile to try re-watching with all of that in mind..."

Wow, I get the banter but after the 40:00 timestamp, it really turned rude towards Riley...

Maybe investigate a little before forming an opinion about something take everything into account then say whatever bullshit u think u know. And i quote Linus "Riley and I have known each other for almost 8 years and we've worked together in some capacity for over half of that time.

If anyone is still wondering why Linus was so "rude" to riley, this is his response from the forums:

TIMESTAMPS:

45:47 Linus offers Riley an opportunity to be more involved.
45:50 Riley asks if he can do the job.
45:52 Linus turns him down hard.
45:55 Riley wonders why Linus brought it up in the first place, or if the burn was meant to be funny but just didn't land. He also starts to wonder how many subscribers he could migrate over to a new channel if it were to come to that. He's nowhere near ready to do that of course, but the seed has been planted nonetheless. It's just a matter of time.
