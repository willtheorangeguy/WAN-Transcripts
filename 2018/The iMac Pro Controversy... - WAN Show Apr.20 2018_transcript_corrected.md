[0.00 → 5.28] Oh boy, it's WAN Showtime!
[5.84 → 6.20] Yay!
[6.64 → 8.50] We got this, we got this!
[8.80 → 9.62] There's, uh...
[9.62 → 11.42] Well, it was WAN Showtime a little while ago, but...
[11.42 → 13.44] Not a ton of news, but there is some news.
[13.58 → 15.88] Oh, there is definitely some news.
[16.02 → 16.74] Did I miss something?
[16.92 → 17.54] Uh, well...
[17.54 → 18.50] Or are you enthusiastic?
[18.74 → 24.00] I am, like, all upset about right-to-repair crap right now.
[24.10 → 24.88] Oh, yes, okay.
[24.92 → 26.08] So there was...
[26.08 → 28.64] Okay, here, what have we got here?
[28.64 → 35.80] Apple iOS 11.3 updated and left some repaired iPhones, I believe specifically third-party
[35.80 → 39.56] repaired iPhones, with no touch functionality.
[39.78 → 42.86] When I first read this, I thought it meant, like, it wouldn't fingerprint you.
[43.00 → 43.80] Oh, okay.
[43.96 → 45.34] Like, no, the screen doesn't work.
[45.46 → 46.76] No, no, no, much worse than that.
[46.82 → 50.16] We're talking iPhones that worked and were bricked by software.
[50.44 → 50.58] Yeah.
[50.86 → 57.08] California is the latest state to explore net neutrality protection after the FCC repeal.
[57.08 → 57.20] Google.
[57.40 → 62.44] And Google Chat is set to rival iMessage and displace SMS.
[62.86 → 63.10] Okay.
[63.10 → 67.38] Okay, that I really want to talk about, too, because, you know, Allo?
[67.98 → 68.18] Yeah.
[68.26 → 71.56] Yeah, that whole team is, like, disbanded now and moved over to this.
[71.78 → 72.04] Okay.
[72.18 → 75.44] Google just straight up cannot make up their mind.
[76.22 → 76.62] Okay.
[76.80 → 78.80] Oh, this I plan to talk about for a fair bit.
[78.88 → 80.10] So Opp...
[80.10 → 82.20] Opp Digital, to be clear.
[82.34 → 86.00] Opp Digital, not Opp, is ceasing development of new products.
[86.00 → 87.30] And if you guys are thinking, what?
[87.52 → 89.50] Aren't they, like, a gigantic phone manufacturer?
[90.18 → 91.32] Opp Digital is not.
[91.56 → 91.82] Yeah.
[92.14 → 94.40] And this is important for a number of reasons.
[94.46 → 98.48] So we're going to get into that after the intro, which will work.
[98.92 → 99.16] Maybe?
[99.42 → 99.64] Yeah.
[99.64 → 117.60] Oh, some people don't like your colour.
[118.22 → 118.74] My colour?
[118.74 → 120.92] They're like, it looks like an Instagram filter.
[123.42 → 123.90] Oh.
[123.90 → 124.16] Oops.
[124.52 → 125.60] Oh, oh, we have sponsors.
[126.40 → 127.22] That's me doing.
[127.22 → 132.40] What do you think?
[133.86 → 135.12] Okay, so here's the problem.
[135.54 → 137.66] It's hard to tell because this is a gaming monitor.
[140.02 → 143.74] And whoever's watching might be on, I don't know.
[143.82 → 144.46] Something else.
[144.50 → 145.18] Something else.
[145.82 → 149.36] But I can tell you guys that looking at it on my blade anyway,
[150.14 → 152.64] I kind of look like that in person.
[152.90 → 154.14] Maybe it's a little rich.
[154.46 → 155.88] Maybe it's a little rich.
[156.62 → 158.14] It's not that far off, though.
[158.20 → 160.06] Like, our shirts are actually, you know what?
[160.08 → 161.36] It's not far off.
[161.58 → 161.76] Yeah.
[162.16 → 167.42] I mean, part of why we look weird might be that we are really popping out as colourful
[167.42 → 170.04] against sort of more neutral set.
[170.16 → 170.80] Will this work?
[171.56 → 173.44] I guess that would do that either way.
[173.52 → 176.90] But there's a light, like, I can almost touch it if I do that.
[177.00 → 177.92] And there's one on that side.
[177.92 → 182.34] And I would almost be able to touch this one if my arms were long because I wasn't a small human.
[182.60 → 182.82] Yeah.
[182.94 → 185.32] Like, it's a very different setup than normal.
[186.12 → 188.50] Oh, I haven't even seen you this week.
[188.64 → 190.74] No, I've barely seen myself this week.
[190.74 → 192.30] Like, what is going on?
[192.30 → 193.56] I've barely slept this week.
[194.48 → 196.36] I went to bed at five in the morning last night.
[199.06 → 200.66] I skipped my stream on Wednesday.
[200.78 → 201.92] I'm skipping my stream tonight.
[203.18 → 205.40] This has been a rough, rough week.
[205.64 → 206.56] We'll make it, though.
[206.74 → 208.06] Next week is looking good.
[208.40 → 208.80] Yeah?
[208.80 → 213.54] If I get everything done this weekend, next week is looking good.
[214.02 → 214.94] Okay, sweet.
[215.04 → 216.96] So this is all float plane stuff you're talking about, right?
[217.04 → 217.60] Oh, okay.
[217.84 → 218.26] All right.
[218.46 → 218.66] Yeah.
[218.92 → 222.50] So I had what I thought were some perfect updates for you.
[222.54 → 224.36] And then I think I ended up crapping on you.
[224.38 → 224.74] You did.
[224.84 → 226.64] Towards the second half of this week as well.
[226.72 → 228.74] That was a good little bump partway through the week.
[229.10 → 229.34] Yeah.
[229.84 → 230.08] Yep.
[231.76 → 233.08] So, you know, it's...
[235.78 → 237.58] Okay, there is a lot going well.
[237.58 → 239.34] We're not explaining any of this stuff.
[239.40 → 239.52] Yeah.
[239.52 → 241.40] I can't really talk about most of it, which isn't very helpful.
[241.74 → 242.66] Yeah, which is unfortunate.
[243.06 → 244.60] We're still progressing.
[245.12 → 246.20] Things are going well.
[246.68 → 250.60] There's the PayPal option on the new site should be ready fairly soon.
[250.96 → 252.64] There's been a lot of minor fixes that have come out.
[252.88 → 254.66] There was one that a lot of people were complaining about,
[254.72 → 256.64] which took us a little while to kind of figure out.
[256.80 → 260.66] But the resolution selection was not showing up for a bunch of people.
[260.66 → 261.94] For people with ad block.
[262.22 → 262.50] Yeah.
[263.88 → 265.06] It shouldn't matter.
[265.36 → 266.98] There are no ads on float plane.
[266.98 → 268.56] It shouldn't matter.
[268.92 → 271.28] But for some reason, that was a thing.
[271.44 → 274.64] So we ended up fixing that, which was nice.
[274.84 → 275.98] I don't think that was technically...
[275.98 → 278.28] To be clear, that wasn't something we were doing intentionally.
[278.66 → 278.80] No.
[278.86 → 279.44] It was just...
[279.44 → 284.78] It was something to do with the element that is our resolution control thing
[284.78 → 289.44] looked like a third-party thing being loaded or something like that.
[289.64 → 289.84] Yeah.
[289.98 → 291.34] So that's now been fixed.
[291.46 → 292.06] So that's good.
[292.70 → 292.96] Yeah.
[292.96 → 293.88] So...
[293.88 → 294.82] And there's been other...
[294.82 → 296.28] Like, there's been a lot of improvement things.
[296.70 → 301.06] My, like, personal week, like, doing the stuff that I do was just rough.
[301.14 → 302.36] The platform is doing great.
[302.68 → 305.16] Just my, like, stuff has been difficult.
[305.54 → 310.26] And when PayPal rolls around, by this time next week, by WAN Show next week, I think we'll
[310.26 → 311.38] have a new creator to announce.
[311.56 → 311.76] Yeah.
[311.76 → 315.90] Maybe two, depending on whether one of them who...
[315.90 → 316.96] I'm just going to say it.
[317.18 → 318.56] Who is a little bit lazy.
[320.28 → 324.14] One of them who's a little bit lazy, depending on whether that one gets back to me with some
[324.14 → 324.50] paperwork.
[326.02 → 326.34] Whatever.
[326.84 → 328.90] I would tell that person to their face.
[330.12 → 330.30] Yeah.
[330.30 → 330.86] Are you asking?
[331.02 → 331.52] Yeah, dog.
[331.52 → 335.88] He knows what's up.
[337.64 → 339.36] Hey, hey, hey, look, look.
[339.76 → 340.56] I wouldn't say...
[340.56 → 341.76] Everyone's going to know.
[341.98 → 348.30] I wouldn't say anything about anyone on WAN Show that I wouldn't say to their face.
[348.34 → 354.50] Because I know that watching WAN Show, if they weren't too lazy, is pretty straightforward.
[356.68 → 358.04] He's not lazy.
[358.34 → 359.40] I don't think anyone's...
[359.40 → 362.92] He's probably just got lots of other important things as well.
[363.10 → 366.24] Look, I've heard it from this person's manager.
[367.74 → 369.74] I've heard it from this person directly.
[370.56 → 374.56] And I have made my own observations about...
[375.40 → 377.06] I like this person very much.
[377.08 → 377.42] Me too.
[377.44 → 378.84] I will not say disparaging things.
[378.84 → 380.22] It's not disparaging.
[380.48 → 382.02] Disparaging has to be untrue.
[382.50 → 382.60] Okay?
[383.02 → 390.30] Very talented creator could probably be much bigger if the sleeves got rolled up a little
[390.30 → 391.00] more often.
[391.14 → 391.66] Wow.
[392.30 → 392.78] I...
[392.78 → 395.64] That's a compliment.
[396.20 → 397.36] That's a compliment.
[397.62 → 398.28] Kind of.
[398.56 → 400.68] It's a backhanded compliment.
[401.02 → 403.06] It's a pat on the back with a spiked glove.
[403.12 → 404.68] It's a subset of compliments.
[405.34 → 406.80] Can we agree on that?
[408.56 → 409.20] All right.
[409.20 → 410.08] Oh, my goodness.
[411.12 → 412.18] Well, then.
[412.54 → 412.86] All right.
[412.86 → 415.96] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[416.16 → 417.54] I want to hide behind the intro.
[417.78 → 418.10] Yeah.
[418.82 → 419.28] No, no.
[419.28 → 419.44] No.
[419.44 → 420.44] I'm coming back.
[420.50 → 421.18] I'm coming back.
[421.60 → 422.56] I got this.
[422.64 → 423.42] Oh, man.
[424.32 → 424.76] Okay.
[424.92 → 428.02] Why don't we jump right into one of our bigger topics of the week?
[428.02 → 428.28] Yes.
[428.28 → 428.54] Yeah.
[428.54 → 433.28] So, the original article here is from motherboard.vice.com.
[434.06 → 434.70] By the way...
[434.70 → 436.02] Let's go ahead and pop this up here.
[436.02 → 440.82] Sharing in the chat and bringing up on screen and talking about stuff is difficult when you're gone.
[440.94 → 442.02] Thank you for coming back.
[442.74 → 443.32] Oh, yeah.
[443.46 → 444.56] Oh, you're very welcome.
[445.20 → 446.60] It's a lot of stuff to do.
[446.76 → 448.32] I was in China last week.
[449.02 → 451.14] That was a lot of fun.
[451.62 → 456.28] We had a lot of people ask us if we were planning a collab with Strange Parts.
[456.76 → 457.88] And no.
[459.14 → 460.52] We weren't planning a collab.
[460.68 → 461.14] Oh, God.
[461.34 → 461.44] Oh, God.
[461.88 → 462.12] Okay.
[462.70 → 463.56] Oh, you know what?
[463.56 → 464.56] I guess I better just...
[465.14 → 465.26] What?
[465.40 → 465.54] What?
[466.02 → 466.84] No, I'm sorry.
[466.96 → 468.04] That one was an accident.
[468.58 → 471.00] The cable management on my mouse is a little tight here.
[471.20 → 472.08] I was so excited.
[472.08 → 474.72] And you made me so sad for such a short period of time.
[474.86 → 475.30] Okay.
[475.42 → 476.98] We were not planning a collab.
[477.18 → 483.88] But actually, I had one of the best in-flight experiences I have ever had on my way to China.
[484.16 → 487.90] So, I did a daytime flight for a change instead of a red eye.
[488.00 → 489.58] So, I was awake for the plane ride.
[489.74 → 489.92] Yeah.
[490.18 → 493.44] And my Wi-Fi was banging.
[493.44 → 503.22] I was getting one megabyte per second downloads for, like, long stretches of what was a nine or ten hour flight or whatever it was.
[503.22 → 503.32] Wow.
[503.54 → 504.42] Yeah, dog.
[504.54 → 505.76] It was nice.
[505.90 → 506.88] To China from here?
[506.88 → 507.88] Yes, sir.
[507.88 → 508.50] Wow.
[508.50 → 515.28] And they did warn me that there would be some kind of sketchy spots over Russia and over China itself.
[515.28 → 520.32] But they actually were very short and speeds were just slower, not bad.
[520.60 → 520.84] Okay.
[521.00 → 521.22] Yeah.
[521.26 → 522.82] So, I was really impressed.
[522.92 → 524.38] And so, I got a lot of work done.
[524.54 → 531.86] I actually got something like 200 emails done while I was on that flight, including several to Scotty.
[532.24 → 532.48] Cool.
[532.48 → 536.14] So, we actually synced up while I was on my way over there.
[536.26 → 539.36] And we ended up working out a plan for getting together.
[539.68 → 545.64] And what we ended up doing was exploring the sort of, the electronics market in Shenzhen.
[545.78 → 548.24] Yeah, because I saw your tweet saying you were doing that with them.
[548.36 → 551.42] So, when you said you didn't do a thing, I was really confused.
[551.58 → 551.88] No, no.
[551.88 → 552.58] I'm really excited about this video.
[552.58 → 553.68] No, we did get together.
[553.82 → 556.66] It's called, uh, Huaquanbei?
[556.82 → 557.56] Huaquanbei?
[558.14 → 558.54] Whatever.
[558.74 → 558.84] Okay.
[558.86 → 559.92] My Chinese is not great.
[559.98 → 561.22] I made him say it in the video.
[561.22 → 561.86] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[561.86 → 562.56] I was just like, no, no.
[562.56 → 564.18] His seems to be quite good.
[564.66 → 565.58] It's okay.
[566.40 → 569.58] My favourite thing is when he says something, and I'm like, wow, I'm impressed.
[569.66 → 573.78] And then the person, like, does a little, like, shuffle back slightly and then responds in English.
[573.86 → 574.88] And I'm like, come on.
[575.00 → 576.56] He tried so hard.
[576.64 → 577.90] That sounded so good.
[579.40 → 579.80] Ouch.
[580.34 → 580.74] Yeah.
[580.74 → 582.38] So, we got together.
[582.86 → 585.18] And we started out just kind of, like, poking around.
[585.42 → 589.18] But what I realized was that place is so vast.
[589.18 → 595.74] And there is so much stuff in it that it is, like, it's overwhelming.
[596.18 → 596.30] Yeah.
[596.52 → 598.26] Like, it's completely overwhelming.
[598.42 → 603.26] Like, if you want laser pointers that can burn stuff, you can find that.
[603.32 → 606.10] If you want what are apparently really cool microscopes.
[606.14 → 607.42] I'm not much of a microscope nerd.
[607.50 → 612.42] But what are apparently, like, super cool microscopes, you can get that stuff.
[612.42 → 617.58] I know Lou from Unbox Therapy ended up, like, going on a shopping spree ultimately.
[617.78 → 620.64] But I'm not much of a shopper.
[620.74 → 625.58] I actually buy very little stuff other than, like, yeah, you too.
[625.92 → 626.00] Yeah.
[626.06 → 628.50] Oh, I thought you were gesturing something.
[628.74 → 629.24] Okay, yeah.
[629.48 → 632.70] Like, we're both kind of cheap.
[632.70 → 643.64] So, I'm not the kind of person who just, like, walks into a mall and is like, oh, wow, I need to buy all the things.
[643.68 → 644.70] My mom bought me this shirt.
[644.76 → 645.16] Thank you, mom.
[645.26 → 647.68] So, what I realized is I needed an objective.
[648.34 → 648.56] Okay.
[648.56 → 653.58] So, what I found out was that his editor is actually based in Mexico.
[654.14 → 654.48] Okay.
[656.12 → 663.84] And is running, like, a very, very, like, very run-of-the-mill and not current-gen editing system.
[664.14 → 666.56] So, I was like, how about this?
[667.08 → 674.40] Let's see if we can build a system here, a video editing system, for cheaper than if we just ordered it off Newegg.com.
[674.72 → 675.14] Okay.
[675.14 → 678.82] So, certain parts, like graphics cards, for example.
[679.00 → 682.98] Mining, by the way, huge in Hashing Bay.
[683.12 → 683.84] I know I said it wrong.
[683.90 → 684.20] I'm sorry.
[684.30 → 684.70] But whatever.
[685.16 → 687.12] Huge in China in general.
[687.48 → 690.84] So, if we had wanted mining stuff, then there's lots of selection.
[691.52 → 700.22] But mining pricing and then the effect that mining has on pricing of components like GPUs is pretty much sort of what it is.
[700.22 → 704.14] It's like people who travel expecting to get a deal on a gold bracelet.
[704.68 → 704.74] Yeah.
[704.74 → 706.68] It's like gold's a commodity.
[707.18 → 708.86] It costs what it costs.
[709.16 → 716.26] And you can pay in whatever sort of rupees or shekels or dong or whatever.
[716.48 → 718.16] You can pay in whatever currency you want.
[718.32 → 719.94] You're still ultimately paying what you're paying.
[721.52 → 725.52] So, certain components, like graphics cards, there were no deals to be found.
[725.52 → 727.36] But then there are other things.
[727.36 → 731.42] Like, I found this, like, 1600 watt power supply that was like 80 bucks.
[731.76 → 732.34] Oh, wow.
[732.36 → 735.02] I didn't buy that one because I picked it up, and I was like, oh, wow.
[735.62 → 737.14] It's far too late for what you're saying it does.
[737.14 → 738.16] There is nothing in there.
[738.94 → 740.28] But, like, cases.
[740.90 → 746.36] You would think, given that they're probably manufactured up the road, that cases would be pretty cheap.
[747.22 → 749.08] So, it turns out cases are actually...
[749.08 → 751.40] Well, okay.
[751.80 → 753.56] The case is a cool part of the video.
[754.02 → 754.32] Okay.
[754.40 → 755.18] You're going to enjoy that.
[755.30 → 755.64] So, anyway.
[755.84 → 758.92] I was like, okay, let's build an editing workstation for his editor.
[759.10 → 762.26] And then halfway through, he's like, you know what?
[762.32 → 763.06] Screw my editor.
[764.02 → 766.04] I'm going to give the system away to my viewers.
[768.22 → 773.48] So, I think what's actually going to happen is he's got a video of kind of his side of this whole interaction.
[773.96 → 775.42] And he filmed so stealthily.
[775.50 → 776.42] I even asked him at the end.
[776.46 → 778.06] I was like, did you film anything?
[778.44 → 779.04] He's like, oh, yeah.
[779.32 → 780.12] I filmed, like, most of it.
[780.20 → 781.48] I'm like, wow.
[782.00 → 785.34] Because, you know how he's always doing that stuff where he, like, puts his camera on the counter.
[785.34 → 785.56] Yeah.
[785.56 → 786.30] And he's got the...
[786.30 → 790.94] Like, that guy is stealthy for a like, tall white dude in China.
[790.94 → 791.02] Yeah.
[793.08 → 794.72] So, he's got his side.
[794.80 → 795.80] And we've got our side.
[795.92 → 799.34] And then he's going to be doing a giveaway of the system that we built to one of his viewers.
[799.46 → 802.52] Because I don't know if people know this in general.
[802.64 → 804.18] But he's trying to go full-time YouTuber.
[804.88 → 805.54] I didn't know that.
[805.62 → 805.80] Yeah.
[805.92 → 807.80] Like, that has been his intent.
[808.32 → 808.74] Oh, okay.
[809.18 → 820.24] So, what looked like just sort of weird side project was actually just a pretty focused, pretty smart dude making some super explosive videos to get his channel kickstarted.
[820.24 → 820.78] Okay, yeah.
[820.94 → 821.16] Yeah.
[821.16 → 826.18] If you guys don't somehow know who we're talking about, it's Scotty from Strange Parts.
[826.26 → 827.96] You can check out the Strange Parts YouTube channel.
[828.20 → 828.34] Yeah.
[828.44 → 834.76] So, he's more likely to be recognized as the guy who built his own iPhone out of parts.
[834.94 → 838.82] Or the guy who added a headphone jack to an iPhone.
[840.26 → 840.90] All right.
[841.66 → 844.38] People are going to be, like, people are going to be flipping their crap.
[844.48 → 845.28] Okay, one spoiler.
[846.22 → 848.44] We end up with a Ry zen system.
[849.00 → 850.06] Oh, cool.
[850.06 → 850.62] Cool.
[851.44 → 851.84] Cool.
[852.02 → 852.18] Yeah.
[852.34 → 852.90] All right.
[853.48 → 860.32] So, let's go back to what I was planning to talk about, which is the new iOS update that...
[860.32 → 860.80] Right, right.
[860.88 → 866.66] This is what got me talking about him because his whole thing is, like, hacking phones, apparently.
[866.66 → 867.20] So, anyway.
[867.72 → 872.22] New iOS update killed touch functionality on iPhone 8.
[873.68 → 875.06] Motherboard.vice.com.
[875.12 → 877.98] You guys got to be careful because that looks like iPhone 8S.
[877.98 → 882.32] That does quite directly look like iPhone 8S.
[882.32 → 890.24] I know it is technically not grammatically correct, but if you throw an apostrophe in there, people will know sort of inherently that you mean iPhone 8s.
[890.24 → 890.54] Oh.
[890.72 → 891.54] It's a common hack.
[891.54 → 892.42] That's not what they mean.
[893.70 → 894.10] Wow.
[894.94 → 895.20] Yeah.
[895.90 → 897.30] There is no iPhone 8S.
[897.88 → 898.28] Yeah.
[898.78 → 899.36] I know.
[899.92 → 900.58] So, yeah.
[900.72 → 906.96] If you put the apostrophe in there, like, little pro tip, it's incorrect, but people will know what you mean.
[907.04 → 907.52] At least...
[907.52 → 907.82] Yeah.
[907.82 → 914.62] Or you can do iPhone 8 phones or something like that, but I don't know if that's good for SEO, but then they don't have that up in the URL anymore.
[914.62 → 915.16] 8S is weird.
[915.42 → 915.94] 8S is weird.
[915.96 → 917.20] 8S is sort of a bad idea.
[917.26 → 917.46] Anyway.
[918.12 → 920.16] So, what went down here was...
[920.16 → 920.60] Not wrong.
[920.90 → 923.32] Apple rolled out iOS 11.3.
[923.32 → 947.08] And if you've every sort of looked into Right to Repair and Apple's reputation around this whole movement, this probably won't surprise you that much because they've been known to do things like not provide third-party repair shops with the tools that they need in order to retain Touch ID functionality on iPhones with replaced home buttons.
[947.08 → 957.82] And this was far more of an issue with a phone like the iPhone 6S, which had a hardware touch button, or excuse me, a hardware home button that was not solid state.
[957.90 → 969.06] So, they switched to the solid state button with the 7, which is much harder to break, whereas those cliquey buttons, no, that was a pretty common piece to end up damaged on the iPhone leading up to that time.
[969.06 → 985.06] So, what would happen was people would take it into a third-party repair shop, and they would have a perfectly authentic button and a perfectly authentic phone, and they would put them together, but without Apple's special sauce, they wouldn't be able to make it work.
[985.46 → 991.50] Even though that has nothing to do with the secure enclave that actually holds the fingerprint information.
[991.96 → 996.40] This was just Apple being restrictive because they can be restrictive.
[996.40 → 1008.10] So, anyway, the issue affected phones that had their screens replaced with after market displays, i.e. not repaired by an Apple-authorized facility.
[1008.58 → 1015.26] And it is believed to be because of an incompatibility between a small chip that controls the screen and the after market displays.
[1016.52 → 1018.90] So, it's possible this is an accident.
[1019.62 → 1023.40] It is possible that it is something Apple did on purpose, but either way...
[1023.40 → 1027.04] John is saying that our apostrophe thing is not incorrect.
[1027.34 → 1030.80] It's an exception, and you can put it after a number if it's a single digit.
[1031.12 → 1031.36] Oh!
[1032.00 → 1033.76] Well, thank you, John Martin!
[1033.92 → 1034.82] Appreciate that!
[1034.88 → 1038.48] Okay, so my confusion there, though, would be if it was an iPhone X.
[1039.64 → 1041.56] Yeah, you would say iPhone XS.
[1042.00 → 1043.86] Yeah, but in text.
[1044.34 → 1046.68] Yeah, but you would say, so, oh, X.
[1046.90 → 1048.06] Because he said single digit.
[1048.42 → 1049.58] Oh, right, it's an X.
[1049.58 → 1050.14] Yeah.
[1050.26 → 1051.22] But it's still not a digit.
[1051.22 → 1051.82] Yeah.
[1052.78 → 1055.64] So, in this case, yeah, our little thing works for it.
[1055.64 → 1055.80] Yes.
[1055.80 → 1056.54] Grammatically correct.
[1056.66 → 1056.82] Hooray.
[1056.96 → 1058.42] But the X's going to wreck everything.
[1059.02 → 1059.86] Go Apple.
[1062.14 → 1064.32] So, I guess this whole...
[1064.32 → 1065.12] This whole...
[1065.12 → 1067.22] Breaching the topic of...
[1067.22 → 1067.50] Broaching?
[1067.70 → 1068.00] Breaching?
[1068.18 → 1068.46] Broaching.
[1068.92 → 1069.20] Whatever.
[1069.82 → 1071.58] On the topic of right to repair,
[1072.26 → 1075.32] yes, I will have a response.
[1075.32 → 1077.02] I don't know if you've been following this drama,
[1077.02 → 1080.46] but we did a video on how our iMac Pro is still broken.
[1082.20 → 1087.24] And, wow, pretty much everyone and their dog has made a response.
[1087.46 → 1092.02] One of the news articles about it on an Apple-centric news site
[1092.02 → 1094.08] has a thousand comments on it.
[1094.92 → 1095.12] Yeah.
[1095.42 → 1095.78] Wow.
[1095.78 → 1097.94] Like, this went viral and sort of very...
[1097.94 → 1100.16] What is the general sentiment?
[1100.34 → 1102.44] The consensus depends on who you ask.
[1102.66 → 1105.50] If people are more of like...
[1105.50 → 1110.18] If they're more in sort of the techie, PC, DIY crowd,
[1110.44 → 1112.08] they're like, wow, this is ridiculous.
[1112.62 → 1112.84] Yeah.
[1112.92 → 1114.78] If they're in the...
[1114.78 → 1120.72] Not that crowd?
[1120.72 → 1121.92] Cupertino crowd.
[1122.32 → 1122.62] Ah.
[1122.84 → 1123.68] Let's call it that.
[1123.74 → 1125.06] If they're in the Cupertino crowd,
[1125.26 → 1128.70] then it's my fault for not reading the terms and conditions
[1128.70 → 1132.50] that stipulate that Apple doesn't have to repair something
[1132.50 → 1134.18] that has been modified by a third party.
[1135.88 → 1136.24] Okay.
[1136.24 → 1136.72] So...
[1136.72 → 1137.18] Okay.
[1138.48 → 1141.92] I actually have a lot of notes made for this video already.
[1141.92 → 1145.54] We'll be addressing the vast majority of the comments
[1145.54 → 1146.90] that people have made.
[1147.06 → 1147.48] That's exciting.
[1147.62 → 1148.40] We don't do that often.
[1148.44 → 1149.64] Articles that have been written.
[1149.64 → 1152.20] Well, actually, we wouldn't be doing it
[1152.20 → 1157.54] except that we still need to fix the freaking iMac Pro.
[1158.12 → 1159.48] So that's in progress.
[1159.92 → 1162.74] We are working on a solution that will allow us
[1162.74 → 1165.10] to get parts and fix it.
[1165.32 → 1165.60] Okay.
[1165.80 → 1167.38] It's going to be a weird solution
[1167.38 → 1169.08] and we're going to be talking about
[1169.08 → 1171.22] the hoops that we've had to jump through
[1171.22 → 1172.24] in order to get there.
[1172.34 → 1173.64] Some of the hoops that were available
[1173.64 → 1175.20] that we chose not to jump through,
[1175.70 → 1178.10] whether because they were too expensive or too sketchy
[1178.10 → 1179.38] or whatever else the case may be,
[1179.64 → 1182.20] but this saga is far from over.
[1182.20 → 1182.64] Cool.
[1182.78 → 1187.10] There is one thing that I absolutely want to address now
[1187.10 → 1189.52] and tell you what.
[1189.60 → 1191.18] I haven't screenshotted anything yet,
[1191.32 → 1193.70] so if you're one of the tool sheds out there
[1193.70 → 1196.20] who posted that this was the reason
[1196.20 → 1197.32] that they denied the repair,
[1197.66 → 1198.90] you can go back and edit your comment
[1198.90 → 1200.68] and you won't end up in the video, okay?
[1200.68 → 1205.32] A shocking number of people said that
[1205.32 → 1207.18] even though Apple never said this
[1207.18 → 1208.86] and it's nowhere in the screenshots
[1208.86 → 1210.80] and it's nowhere in the policy
[1210.80 → 1212.56] and it's certainly not in the video,
[1212.56 → 1214.96] a number of people have concluded
[1214.96 → 1217.02] that Apple didn't repair it
[1217.02 → 1219.20] because the cost of the parts,
[1219.20 → 1221.14] I mean, you guys totalled this thing,
[1221.32 → 1223.60] the cost of the parts is so high
[1223.60 → 1225.76] that it's more than just buying a new machine anyway,
[1225.76 → 1227.40] so you should just buy a new machine.
[1227.64 → 1228.38] What are you, stupid?
[1230.14 → 1230.60] Okay.
[1230.60 → 1241.26] Even if all the parts that we listed in the video,
[1241.48 → 1245.62] the display, the main board, and the power supply,
[1246.02 → 1247.66] even if they're all dead,
[1247.96 → 1249.62] which they may very well not be,
[1249.62 → 1252.22] you can actually have a component short out
[1252.22 → 1255.68] and be protected by the onboard circuitry
[1255.68 → 1259.02] that does exist in some cases.
[1259.02 → 1260.08] If you get lucky,
[1260.22 → 1262.04] you can actually have sparks fly off a board
[1262.04 → 1263.48] and have it live for years.
[1264.44 → 1266.72] Even if all the components
[1266.72 → 1269.34] that we think could possibly be dead
[1269.34 → 1271.08] are in fact dead,
[1271.60 → 1275.16] that is a $5,000 machine.
[1275.80 → 1276.86] You've got to be drinking
[1276.86 → 1279.92] some pretty freaking amazing Kool-Aid
[1279.92 → 1281.46] to think that a monitor,
[1282.80 → 1283.40] a motherboard,
[1283.96 → 1285.12] and a power supply
[1285.12 → 1287.60] are worth $5,000.
[1287.60 → 1289.76] That's at least a $3,000 power supply.
[1290.12 → 1291.16] $3,000 power supply?
[1291.26 → 1291.62] Easy.
[1291.72 → 1292.70] Get off my show.
[1292.80 → 1293.18] I don't even know who you're talking.
[1293.18 → 1293.78] Get off my show.
[1293.80 → 1294.60] You don't even work here.
[1297.90 → 1298.52] That's fair.
[1299.30 → 1301.18] The CPU alone
[1301.18 → 1304.58] is like $500, $700?
[1305.18 → 1305.38] Yeah.
[1305.88 → 1309.04] The 32 gigs of DDR4 ECC RAM,
[1309.16 → 1310.02] yeah, that has a value.
[1310.18 → 1310.74] That's expensive.
[1311.14 → 1311.70] The chassis,
[1311.92 → 1313.36] remember, this is an Apple chassis.
[1313.54 → 1314.54] It's a special chassis.
[1315.00 → 1316.14] That costs money.
[1316.64 → 1317.32] The SSD,
[1317.68 → 1318.90] the dual SSDs,
[1319.16 → 1320.40] those are still good.
[1320.92 → 1321.98] So people running in going,
[1322.36 → 1322.98] well,
[1323.38 → 1324.20] I mean,
[1324.24 → 1325.20] you broke this stuff.
[1325.32 → 1326.14] Total write-off.
[1326.28 → 1326.82] Total write-off.
[1327.18 → 1328.34] That's why they wouldn't replace it.
[1328.44 → 1329.18] The cost was too high.
[1329.58 → 1330.96] And I had one guy being like,
[1331.04 → 1331.38] that's like,
[1331.62 → 1331.80] you know,
[1331.88 → 1333.42] it's going to be $300 of labour
[1333.42 → 1334.82] plus the cost of these parts
[1334.82 → 1336.20] is more than the cost of the system.
[1336.28 → 1336.82] What are you, drunk?
[1336.82 → 1339.92] Oh, man.
[1339.98 → 1340.76] Like the amount of,
[1340.78 → 1342.90] like the amount of worship
[1342.90 → 1344.96] that goes on here
[1344.96 → 1347.46] just boggles my mind.
[1347.52 → 1348.08] It baffles me.
[1348.12 → 1348.32] Anyway,
[1348.54 → 1349.34] there will be a video.
[1349.82 → 1351.30] I promise it will be epic.
[1351.92 → 1352.72] And I don't know
[1352.72 → 1353.94] if I'm ready to promise this yet,
[1354.08 → 1356.46] but we are definitely working on flying
[1356.46 → 1358.16] Mr. Louis Grossman out here
[1358.16 → 1360.28] to help me put this thing back together.
[1360.28 → 1360.56] Oh, that would be cool.
[1360.82 → 1361.08] Okay?
[1361.78 → 1362.90] That would be awesome.
[1363.08 → 1365.06] So I have nothing else to say about it
[1365.06 → 1366.54] until the video comes out,
[1366.58 → 1368.92] but it's going to be fun.
[1369.76 → 1370.88] We're going to have some fun.
[1371.04 → 1371.40] We're going to,
[1371.46 → 1371.78] we're going to,
[1372.02 → 1372.46] you know,
[1372.50 → 1373.06] I don't drink,
[1373.18 → 1373.58] but we'll,
[1373.70 → 1373.98] we'll,
[1374.06 → 1375.80] we'll figuratively pop some brew skis
[1375.80 → 1377.80] and fix an iMac Pro
[1377.80 → 1379.46] and talk about how that's going.
[1379.64 → 1380.14] And it's going to,
[1380.14 → 1380.98] it's going to be a good thing.
[1381.06 → 1381.80] It's going to be a good thing.
[1382.00 → 1383.02] I'll drink them for you.
[1383.34 → 1383.50] Uh,
[1383.54 → 1383.80] yes.
[1384.00 → 1385.02] A turn would be happy
[1385.02 → 1386.34] to drink brew skis for me.
[1386.54 → 1387.64] Oh my God.
[1387.64 → 1387.92] That,
[1387.98 → 1388.20] that,
[1388.20 → 1388.44] that,
[1388.44 → 1389.42] have you already started turn?
[1389.66 → 1389.84] That,
[1389.84 → 1391.02] that bullet is what he,
[1391.22 → 1393.28] it's all good.
[1395.06 → 1395.78] All right.
[1396.04 → 1396.44] Um,
[1396.66 → 1398.38] speaking of drinking,
[1398.82 → 1399.04] Hey,
[1399.10 → 1399.46] by the way,
[1399.50 → 1400.48] what time do we start tomorrow?
[1400.92 → 1401.44] 10 o'clock.
[1401.54 → 1401.76] Okay.
[1401.96 → 1402.50] I told you.
[1402.58 → 1403.46] I'm just making sure.
[1403.54 → 1403.74] Okay.
[1403.98 → 1405.04] I ordered food for you
[1405.04 → 1405.90] because he didn't order it.
[1406.10 → 1407.66] I've been very busy.
[1408.86 → 1409.48] Thank you.
[1409.58 → 1410.52] Speaking of drinking,
[1410.52 → 1413.58] we actually have a deeper relationship
[1413.58 → 1415.70] that we're forming with Marina's coffee
[1415.70 → 1416.80] over the next little bit.
[1417.22 → 1417.58] Uh,
[1417.64 → 1417.88] wait,
[1418.02 → 1418.42] I don't know.
[1418.48 → 1418.98] Is this,
[1419.08 → 1420.06] is this out there yet?
[1420.26 → 1421.34] I don't know if,
[1421.34 → 1421.60] uh,
[1421.60 → 1422.56] Colton's going to run down
[1422.56 → 1423.60] and yell at me if I,
[1423.68 → 1424.52] if I say this.
[1425.06 → 1426.80] I think I'm just going to do it.
[1426.84 → 1427.44] Should I just do it?
[1427.60 → 1427.94] I mean,
[1428.04 → 1428.94] I don't work here anymore.
[1429.04 → 1429.36] Go ahead.
[1430.52 → 1430.86] We are,
[1430.94 → 1433.08] we are apparently going to be doing our own blend.
[1433.70 → 1434.00] Oh,
[1434.94 → 1435.68] that's cool.
[1435.86 → 1436.06] Yeah.
[1436.10 → 1436.28] Really?
[1436.52 → 1436.78] Yeah.
[1437.68 → 1438.08] Cool.
[1438.28 → 1438.52] Yeah.
[1438.60 → 1439.46] How is that going to work?
[1439.82 → 1440.18] Um,
[1440.62 → 1440.76] there,
[1440.82 → 1441.18] there's a way.
[1441.24 → 1441.56] Don't worry.
[1441.74 → 1442.02] Okay.
[1442.18 → 1442.38] Yeah.
[1442.42 → 1444.78] Like it's actually less complicated than you might think.
[1445.42 → 1445.90] I don't,
[1445.98 → 1447.42] I know nothing about coffee.
[1447.60 → 1447.88] Anyway.
[1449.38 → 1450.04] As you know.
[1450.16 → 1450.28] So,
[1450.36 → 1451.04] Marina's coffee,
[1451.16 → 1451.92] coffee for fuel,
[1452.02 → 1452.48] big cans,
[1452.56 → 1454.40] a cold-brewed coffee with a flavour for,
[1454.40 → 1455.90] pretty much everyone.
[1456.00 → 1457.04] They got cappuccino,
[1457.24 → 1458.00] dark roast,
[1458.12 → 1458.54] café mocha.
[1458.62 → 1460.08] That's actually two X dark roast.
[1460.70 → 1462.76] And they're all inconvenient,
[1463.00 → 1464.04] ready to drink.
[1464.70 → 1465.06] Man.
[1465.14 → 1465.90] It's in ounces.
[1466.82 → 1467.74] 444 millilitre.
[1467.90 → 1468.02] Yeah.
[1468.06 → 1468.20] See,
[1468.36 → 1468.88] we got to do them.
[1468.94 → 1469.82] We got to do the millilitres.
[1470.02 → 1471.84] And from now until April 27th,
[1471.84 → 1473.40] you can get half off.
[1473.62 → 1473.80] Yes.
[1473.82 → 1474.22] My friends,
[1474.22 → 1478.02] that is 50% off your Marina's coffee order with discount code Linus.
[1478.02 → 1480.32] And the first 50 people to use the code,
[1480.54 → 1483.94] please like to keep the WAN show running in the background though.
[1483.98 → 1484.94] I know you guys are in a hurry,
[1485.04 → 1485.62] but come on.
[1485.90 → 1490.44] The first 50 to use code Linus here are going to get a free six-pack of cold brew in the U.S.
[1490.48 → 1490.78] Nice.
[1490.94 → 1494.70] Or a free bag of their micro roast international.
[1495.12 → 1496.76] And that'll automatically be added to your order.
[1496.84 → 1499.68] Just go to madrinuscoffee.com slash Linus.
[1499.84 → 1502.06] And international shipping is now available.
[1502.50 → 1504.50] It's not cheap to ship internationally,
[1504.66 → 1508.06] but Marines is paying 15% of the shipping cost to help you all out.
[1508.12 → 1510.08] If you have any questions about the flavours or how to order,
[1510.38 → 1512.90] Solomon from Marines is in the Twitch chat.
[1513.10 → 1513.46] Yes.
[1514.76 → 1515.44] Fresh books.
[1515.88 → 1516.04] Oh,
[1516.12 → 1516.70] wait a minute.
[1517.04 → 1517.76] There you go.
[1517.92 → 1519.66] There's your Marina's coffee stuff right there.
[1519.76 → 1521.26] I'll leave that up, and I'll go talk about fresh books.
[1524.52 → 1526.78] Fresh books is our other sponsor for the show today.
[1526.86 → 1531.40] It's the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than just help you create
[1531.40 → 1532.88] and send slick looking invoices.
[1533.10 → 1538.16] It helps small business owners and freelancers keep track of their accounting in a way that is
[1538.16 → 1541.38] actually make that actually makes sense to normal people.
[1541.54 → 1546.58] So you don't have to have like an accounting certificate in order to run a small business
[1546.58 → 1552.92] doing, you know, networking for local businesses or computer repair out of your garage or teaching
[1552.92 → 1554.46] dance lessons out of your garage.
[1554.68 → 1558.12] One of the most helpful things in my opinion, too, is especially for someone who doesn't have
[1558.12 → 1560.54] a lot of time because they're trying to do their actual freaking job.
[1560.66 → 1563.66] If you have a problem, and you need to call them, you talk directly to a person.
[1563.88 → 1564.02] Yeah.
[1564.08 → 1565.22] And they will help you with that.
[1565.28 → 1569.52] They've got apps for iOS and Android so that you can take their timesheet function,
[1569.74 → 1571.60] their expense management functions.
[1571.68 → 1573.36] You can take all that stuff with you on the go.
[1574.06 → 1578.52] And they even have a feature to let you see when your client has seen your invoice for the
[1578.52 → 1580.68] first time to put an end to the guessing games.
[1580.68 → 1583.56] So head over to freshbooks.com.
[1583.68 → 1584.38] Oh, dang it.
[1585.02 → 1589.92] So head over to freshbooks.com slash WAN and get your 30-day free trial today.
[1590.02 → 1593.00] Just enter the WAN show in the How Did You Hear About Us section.
[1593.98 → 1597.16] Leading us finally to...
[1597.86 → 1599.20] Nope, I'm not going to change it.
[1599.46 → 1603.36] I'm just going to leave FreshBooks up there, and then we're going to eat some Savage Jerky.
[1603.60 → 1603.96] Okay.
[1604.08 → 1606.16] And then I'm going to change...
[1606.80 → 1608.96] I'm going to leave that Savage Jerky one on for a bit.
[1608.96 → 1611.32] I'm just going to have a time delay.
[1611.44 → 1613.82] It's like rooting through like a treasure chest.
[1614.14 → 1614.70] I know, right?
[1615.66 → 1618.82] They sent so much maple buffalo bacon, and I'm so excited.
[1618.94 → 1622.30] I'm going to have some, but I'm going to have some of the sriracha bacon first.
[1622.40 → 1624.44] They sent lots of bacon today.
[1624.64 → 1625.24] I'm in...
[1625.24 → 1625.60] No!
[1626.24 → 1628.18] I'm not sharing that kind though.
[1628.20 → 1628.90] It's for me.
[1629.36 → 1631.14] They sent it because they know I like it.
[1631.20 → 1633.06] They didn't send it because they know you like it, Ed.
[1634.10 → 1636.20] Maybe if they send even more next time,
[1636.20 → 1639.08] I will consider sharing the maple buffalo bacon.
[1639.42 → 1641.32] I want to put this over there where I can't get it.
[1641.52 → 1642.32] Yeah, actually.
[1642.56 → 1642.88] Yeah.
[1643.00 → 1643.28] Hold on.
[1643.28 → 1644.46] I'm going to put this over here.
[1644.62 → 1645.18] We're hiding that.
[1645.18 → 1645.54] You know what?
[1645.66 → 1647.36] I'm going to put it right next to me.
[1648.86 → 1649.22] Okay.
[1649.26 → 1650.12] So it's not being hidden.
[1650.24 → 1652.44] It's being put in like a high threat area.
[1652.58 → 1653.04] That's right.
[1653.88 → 1654.36] You get close.
[1654.42 → 1655.48] You're going to get swatted, yo.
[1657.58 → 1658.34] No, not that.
[1660.34 → 1662.46] Like, what do you think, man?
[1662.46 → 1665.78] Like a, you know, like...
[1665.78 → 1666.14] I know.
[1666.58 → 1667.82] Like, swatted.
[1668.34 → 1669.08] We're just...
[1669.08 → 1669.50] I don't know.
[1669.66 → 1672.34] We're on the platform that that is, like, popular on.
[1675.92 → 1677.86] Savage jerky is made with high quality ingredients...
[1677.86 → 1678.68] That was pretty savage.
[1679.16 → 1680.72] ...without nitrates or preservatives.
[1681.86 → 1685.72] Their goal was to create a snack that's full of flavour and not bad for you.
[1685.92 → 1687.78] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky.
[1688.74 → 1690.42] Some of the favourites are a sriracha bacon.
[1690.52 → 1691.32] This one's actually perfect.
[1691.32 → 1692.44] I don't know if I've tried this one before.
[1692.52 → 1693.22] This is perfect.
[1694.08 → 1695.32] Their maple buffalo bacon.
[1695.88 → 1696.64] It's traditional.
[1697.50 → 1697.82] Mojo.
[1697.98 → 1699.34] Mojo flavours are fantastic.
[1701.14 → 1704.14] Aside from jerky, they make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and a spice rub.
[1704.44 → 1707.48] Their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[1708.18 → 1708.56] The bell.
[1708.96 → 1709.22] Ha ha.
[1709.30 → 1710.58] I think I've made that joke before, but whatever.
[1710.66 → 1711.48] It's the Carolina Reaper.
[1711.72 → 1712.04] Duh.
[1712.10 → 1712.70] It's right in the name.
[1712.70 → 1718.70] And you can use offer code LTT to save 10% over at savagejerky.com.
[1718.70 → 1721.90] That one's perfect.
[1723.12 → 1723.58] Dang.
[1723.82 → 1724.44] Sriracha bacon?
[1724.78 → 1725.06] Mm-hmm.
[1725.12 → 1725.54] Can I try it?
[1727.96 → 1728.40] Yes.
[1728.82 → 1729.10] Ha ha.
[1729.48 → 1731.48] I technically only claimed the maple buffalo bacon.
[1731.74 → 1732.24] Ha ha ha.
[1733.18 → 1733.94] Only one piece.
[1733.94 → 1735.14] I might claim this in the future, though.
[1735.56 → 1736.10] Really nice.
[1737.24 → 1737.74] All right.
[1738.46 → 1741.52] So the original article here is from arstechnica.com.
[1741.52 → 1758.36] But it would appear as though California is the latest in a number of states that are exploring net neutrality bills to protect net neutrality in spite of what's going on with the federal government.
[1758.36 → 1769.20] So basically, they're attempting to restore net neutrality provisions that are similar to the ones that were used by the FCC before their recent repeal.
[1769.86 → 1779.36] However, in addition to prohibiting fast lanes, throttling, blocking, and paid prioritization, they want to go a step further to prohibit zero rating.
[1779.36 → 1785.16] Which is when the use of a certain site, such as Netflix, doesn't count against a user's data cap.
[1785.70 → 1791.90] Now, I have mixed feelings about zero rating.
[1791.90 → 1793.86] It sounds cool.
[1795.02 → 1795.92] Like, at first.
[1797.12 → 1804.46] The issue with it, the big issue with it is, say, one of these ISPs owns a service, which is really common.
[1805.72 → 1811.36] They could zero rate their own service so that you subscribe to them instead of someone else.
[1811.44 → 1812.12] So John's coming.
[1812.92 → 1815.90] But in the meantime, I want to present my...
[1816.48 → 1817.48] He's deleted all his notes.
[1817.48 → 1830.12] I want to present my sort of dumb consumer who's very selfish sort of point of view and go, well, I can see things about this that I would really like.
[1831.02 → 1833.70] Because zero rating can be applied in that way.
[1834.16 → 1841.36] Where someone like a Comcast might say that, okay, you know, watching shows from...
[1841.36 → 1841.90] Comcast.
[1842.00 → 1842.98] Who owns Comcast again?
[1843.18 → 1844.26] Or who does Comcast own?
[1844.58 → 1845.06] NBC.
[1845.30 → 1845.66] NBC.
[1845.66 → 1845.82] NBC.
[1845.90 → 1846.08] Okay.
[1846.08 → 1849.70] So, you know, NBC streams don't count against your data usage.
[1850.34 → 1857.00] But there are cases of zero rating where they aren't implementing it on their own services.
[1857.22 → 1859.82] Like, for example, T-Mobile allows...
[1859.82 → 1861.34] I think it's YouTube streaming.
[1862.02 → 1863.56] Doesn't count against your data plan.
[1864.74 → 1867.44] Well, I mean, Google doesn't own T-Mobile and vice versa.
[1867.72 → 1869.24] This is just a handshake deal.
[1869.24 → 1878.54] Which, again, on the surface can look perfect for consumers because, hey, you can watch all the YouTube you want if you're a T-Mobile customer.
[1878.80 → 1881.54] Theoretically, that hurts, like, Twitch and whatever else.
[1881.76 → 1886.66] But, or some, you know, young upstart video streaming platform.
[1887.34 → 1887.74] Hey.
[1888.58 → 1890.02] That has higher bit rates.
[1890.02 → 1893.40] And that doesn't have a chance to talk to T-Mobile about such an arrangement.
[1893.54 → 1897.56] So, John's going to tag in for me and talk in a little bit more detail about...
[1897.56 → 1897.84] Oh, no.
[1897.84 → 1898.70] That was why you're here, right?
[1898.88 → 1899.10] Yeah.
[1899.26 → 1900.14] I know we got to that part already.
[1900.14 → 1900.54] Yeah, no, no.
[1900.84 → 1903.36] Feel free to explain it in better detail than what...
[1903.36 → 1903.92] Go, go, go.
[1903.92 → 1904.02] Okay.
[1904.04 → 1905.50] It was like the last bullet point, though.
[1905.50 → 1907.42] So, okay.
[1907.60 → 1913.46] So, we're looking at the California bill on net neutrality, right?
[1914.36 → 1914.68] Okay.
[1915.06 → 1917.06] So, which bullet point are we on?
[1917.14 → 1918.20] The last bullet point is here.
[1918.32 → 1922.02] We've only gone through a few of them, but we've talked about this kind of thing on the show before.
[1922.14 → 1924.62] So, I think a lot of people kinds of know essentially what's going on.
[1924.70 → 1924.90] Okay.
[1924.90 → 1928.04] So, you talked about zero rating already, right?
[1928.06 → 1928.18] Yeah.
[1928.34 → 1928.76] So, okay.
[1928.76 → 1928.84] Okay.
[1929.22 → 1931.82] So, right now the bill is that...
[1931.82 → 1935.70] It got passed by like this little subcommittee or something in their state house.
[1935.84 → 1936.06] Okay.
[1936.22 → 1939.76] So, it still has to be passed by both chambers, signed into law and all that.
[1939.94 → 1946.56] But both chambers and the governor's mansion are currently controlled by Democrats who traditionally have been more friendly towards net neutrality.
[1946.64 → 1947.72] So, we'll see what happens to it.
[1948.50 → 1955.32] Right now, ISPs are unsurprisingly opposing the bill, and they also might challenge it in court if it does indeed become law.
[1955.32 → 1960.10] There are a number of legal arguments they could use to try to get this scrapped.
[1960.28 → 1968.32] And this is interesting not only because California is such a huge state, but since the SEC repeal a few months ago, I think they've gone...
[1968.84 → 1976.42] So far, they've gone further than any other states have in trying to have like a real sort of like comprehensive net neutrality law, right?
[1976.70 → 1983.32] So, what I put down here was they might argue federal preemption or that the bill unduly burdens...
[1983.96 → 1984.94] What is federal preemption?
[1985.34 → 1989.12] So, that is when a federal law and a state law come into conflict.
[1989.36 → 1989.52] Okay.
[1989.54 → 1991.42] And there are a number of ways that can happen.
[1991.56 → 1996.98] Obviously, there are very clear cases where the federal law says one thing and the state law says exactly the opposite.
[1997.16 → 1999.46] So, you don't need to be a lawyer to understand that.
[1999.56 → 2003.54] But there's also cases where it's a little bit more subtle, this being one of them.
[2003.54 → 2015.98] So, what happened when the FCC repealed the net neutrality protections a few months back, they specifically said we need to return to light touch regulation of the internet.
[2016.14 → 2017.54] This is exactly what we're doing.
[2017.54 → 2025.40] So, is it really actually preempting anything if in lines of just going to reach over the desk here and steal some more sriracha bacon jerky?
[2025.50 → 2026.00] I don't blame them.
[2026.16 → 2026.80] That stuff is delicious.
[2027.12 → 2027.52] But...
[2027.52 → 2028.88] It's good.
[2029.02 → 2029.16] Yeah.
[2029.16 → 2030.16] Okay.
[2030.16 → 2030.52] Anyway.
[2030.52 → 2034.40] So, what was I talking about?
[2034.52 → 2035.18] Federal preemption.
[2035.30 → 2037.08] It was distracting me with this little like bacon grab.
[2037.60 → 2037.74] Okay.
[2037.86 → 2038.66] So, we just...
[2038.66 → 2038.82] Right.
[2038.82 → 2039.26] Okay.
[2039.38 → 2040.98] So, they're trying to...
[2040.98 → 2046.26] The FCC is saying they're trying to regulate the internet less, give the ISPs a little more leeway.
[2046.46 → 2046.60] Yeah.
[2046.60 → 2049.90] But the question here then becomes, is there...
[2049.90 → 2052.60] Does that mean the federal government is intending to...
[2053.26 → 2055.18] In law, they call it occupying the field.
[2055.40 → 2061.86] Does the federal government intend to regulate this area so heavily that the states can't do anything about it?
[2062.08 → 2067.72] But in their own order, they said, we're trying to regulate this less heavily and scrap these net neutrality regulations.
[2068.36 → 2068.50] Right.
[2068.50 → 2071.26] That would be a very interesting like battle in court.
[2071.44 → 2071.66] Yeah.
[2071.66 → 2071.90] Okay.
[2072.20 → 2072.38] Yeah.
[2072.38 → 2080.34] So, they're saying like we don't want to regulate this as much, but they're aggressively not regulating and trying to make sure that no one else can either?
[2080.66 → 2090.36] Well, I don't know if they're consciously trying to do that, but what I'm saying is like when a big like ISP takes the state of California to court and says they can't do this,
[2090.70 → 2094.86] they might try to argue that the federal government has tried to occupy the field somehow.
[2094.98 → 2097.42] It might not be a great argument, but I expect them to try it.
[2097.42 → 2106.94] The other thing they might argue is, which they might be more successful with, is saying the bill unduly burdens interstate commerce, which is a constitutional argument.
[2107.36 → 2108.34] But basically...
[2108.34 → 2109.52] The states are so weird.
[2109.58 → 2110.10] I know, right?
[2110.10 → 2119.26] But the idea is that one state can't meddle in the affairs of how other states want to conduct commerce between them.
[2119.58 → 2119.74] Okay.
[2120.46 → 2124.66] So, like if you're importing, like let's use a simpler example.
[2124.74 → 2126.58] Let's say you're importing a bunch of bacon jerky.
[2126.72 → 2129.48] Let's say the state of North Carolina is importing a bunch of bacon jerky.
[2130.16 → 2132.14] Like from another state or from another country?
[2132.14 → 2132.96] Let's say from another state.
[2133.18 → 2133.40] Okay.
[2133.40 → 2139.96] So, actually that would make sense because I think savage jerky is based out of Georgia, so it will be a quick trip.
[2140.84 → 2146.44] But anyway, so let's say they're importing a bunch of bacon jerky, and they have regulations on bacon jerky.
[2146.60 → 2147.16] Was that bacon jerky?
[2147.58 → 2148.88] Bacon jerky, bacon jerky, bacon jerky.
[2149.42 → 2150.74] It's like that of someone Linus.
[2150.88 → 2155.22] So anyway, so let's say there are regulations that the state of NC has on bacon jerky.
[2155.22 → 2160.90] Let's say they can't have but so many preservatives, they have to be at least 95% beef or whatever else, right?
[2160.94 → 2163.50] This is just a random made-up example.
[2163.54 → 2164.30] Yes, it's hypothetical.
[2164.56 → 2165.26] This is not actually real.
[2165.28 → 2166.72] You probably shouldn't have very much beef in it.
[2168.92 → 2169.58] It's Friday.
[2169.70 → 2170.30] It's been a long week.
[2170.42 → 2170.64] I'm sorry.
[2171.04 → 2171.46] Okay, anyway.
[2171.66 → 2172.80] That would be a good thing to regulate then.
[2172.98 → 2183.40] So, let's say they have one set of regulations for bacon jerky produced in-state and another set for bacon jerky they're importing from Georgia.
[2183.40 → 2185.84] So that would be against the Constitution.
[2186.04 → 2186.62] You can't do that.
[2186.72 → 2188.94] But if the same rules apply to everybody, it will be okay.
[2189.38 → 2198.72] This is a little bit more complicated because I could see AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, whoever else walking into court and saying that even though the law – because I actually read the law a little bit.
[2198.92 → 2203.74] And it applies to any ISP that has customers in California, which makes sense.
[2203.90 → 2207.40] But they could argue something about, oh, the Internet is so decentralized.
[2207.94 → 2213.14] And because of that, this isn't like just importing a product or whatever, and this is placing an undue burden on interstate commerce.
[2213.14 → 2217.08] Whether that would win, I have no idea, but I do expect a lengthy court battle.
[2219.82 → 2220.22] Okay.
[2220.36 → 2221.12] So there you have it.
[2221.20 → 2222.80] The Internet is not like bacon jerky.
[2224.30 → 2225.92] Well, thank you, John, for that insight.
[2225.92 → 2227.66] And this has been the Legal Corner with John, I guess.
[2227.88 → 2228.44] Have a good weekend.
[2228.92 → 2229.46] Thanks, John.
[2229.54 → 2229.70] Yep.
[2231.06 → 2232.26] Man, the states are weird.
[2232.42 → 2232.64] Yeah.
[2233.20 → 2233.54] I know.
[2233.60 → 2234.02] It's Tripp.
[2234.30 → 2236.68] I'll never fully understand how all that kind of stuff works.
[2236.68 → 2242.26] 52, or like maybe but not 52, because there are also like territories or something.
[2242.52 → 2242.94] And then –
[2242.94 → 2243.46] 50 states ones.
[2243.64 → 2246.38] 50 states, but then like what is the –
[2246.38 → 2247.08] What are the ones that aren't –
[2247.08 → 2248.38] Yeah, what are the ones that aren't states?
[2248.46 → 2248.94] Because there's –
[2248.94 → 2249.54] Guam, Puerto Rico.
[2249.62 → 2250.76] Yeah, Guam, Puerto Rico.
[2250.96 → 2252.28] What are those like called?
[2252.40 → 2257.12] And they're all kind of like little countries, except that they're one country, sort of.
[2257.12 → 2264.38] Except when they like want to do things that the ones running the one country don't like,
[2264.56 → 2267.32] then – or that they don't like, and then I don't know.
[2267.36 → 2270.78] Then they can like actually fight about that, whereas in most other countries it's just like,
[2270.88 → 2272.16] no, this is how it works.
[2272.26 → 2272.80] This is how it works, yeah.
[2272.80 → 2273.28] It's interesting.
[2273.46 → 2276.96] It's confusing for someone who isn't from there and didn't like to grow up in the system.
[2278.24 → 2280.26] I think it's confusing for the people there too.
[2280.90 → 2281.42] Yes, it is.
[2281.76 → 2282.72] It really, really is.
[2282.98 → 2283.34] I agree.
[2283.56 → 2284.38] Google chat.
[2285.32 → 2285.76] Yeah.
[2285.76 → 2287.68] The original article here is from Tom's Guide.
[2289.92 → 2290.32] Wow.
[2290.38 → 2290.86] So, okay.
[2291.10 → 2296.28] You had a comment that all the – the Allo team was dissolved and brought over here, apparently.
[2296.54 → 2296.82] Yes.
[2297.96 → 2300.20] This is not the first time this has happened.
[2300.40 → 2301.84] Do you think this is the last time?
[2302.80 → 2308.22] Man, I don't know what to tell you because the article that I was reading about this
[2308.22 → 2314.96] basically had like a timeline of the whole experience of –
[2314.96 → 2320.44] of Google and chat applications going all the way back to I think Google Talk was the first one.
[2320.52 → 2325.36] So to give people a little bit of background, Google Chat is a newly proposed thing from Google.
[2325.36 → 2334.26] It is set to rival iMessage and displace SMS, which is probably the exact same lines that we've had with previous chat applications from Google.
[2334.26 → 2337.50] But they are taking a different approach this time.
[2337.60 → 2345.74] So to be clear, this is not Google Talk turning into Chat, turning into – oh, man, was it then integrated with Google Plus?
[2346.14 → 2347.68] And then turning into Hangouts?
[2347.68 → 2348.04] It was.
[2348.52 → 2349.26] And then –
[2349.82 → 2350.36] Allo.
[2350.42 → 2350.90] Allo.
[2351.16 → 2352.20] And the other one.
[2352.20 → 2353.30] Was there another one?
[2353.36 → 2354.08] What was the other one?
[2354.48 → 2360.88] They released like two – I remember last time the most confusing thing was that they released two at basically the same time, and they were only marginally different.
[2362.08 → 2362.60] Yeah.
[2363.18 → 2365.28] It was Allo and like something else.
[2365.44 → 2368.90] I've had a hard time keeping track of exactly what's been going on.
[2368.90 → 2380.64] And yet like I just – I find the whole experience of both SMS and chat on Android very frustrating because the feature sets are divergent in like little stupid ways.
[2380.90 → 2389.54] So for example, the messages team, like, you know, just the default vanilla stock Android – I shouldn't say vanilla because that might be an Android at some point.
[2389.54 → 2401.32] Like the stock Android messages app is like so back-ass words in some ways where like it doesn't have cloud backup.
[2401.54 → 2402.70] And I'm kind of sitting here going, what?
[2402.70 → 2405.12] What if that's a way to get around YouTube demonetization, saying it that way?
[2405.90 → 2406.60] Bass-backwards?
[2407.16 → 2407.62] Yeah.
[2407.74 → 2408.00] I don't know.
[2408.10 → 2408.38] Probably.
[2409.44 → 2411.12] So it's like it's so backwards.
[2411.24 → 2418.52] It doesn't even have cloud backup, which just blows me away that that's not completely automatic when I switch from one Android phone to another one.
[2418.52 → 2420.02] All my SMS messages are gone.
[2420.76 → 2434.10] But that team apparently still exists because it must have – I don't think it was that long ago that they looked at how, well, a lot of people are busy using Facebook Messenger because SMS is sort of trash by today's standards.
[2435.12 → 2438.22] And basically the only thing they're using SMS for is verification codes.
[2438.42 → 2443.98] So when you get your notification for messages, it has mark as red, which is like awesome.
[2444.66 → 2445.98] So you never have to touch it again.
[2446.06 → 2447.90] You don't have to click through it to mark it as red.
[2447.90 → 2451.00] You don't have to – if you swipe it away, it doesn't stay unread.
[2452.30 → 2452.74] Awesome.
[2453.66 → 2454.60] That is pretty great.
[2454.82 → 2456.00] Hangouts doesn't have that.
[2456.70 → 2457.96] Gmail doesn't have that.
[2458.64 → 2464.52] And pretty much – I mean pretty much any app now is just notification spam as far as I can tell.
[2464.98 → 2470.90] And so the ability to mark a notification as red when it comes in without actually opening the notification.
[2470.90 → 2472.84] Very nice.
[2472.84 → 2476.04] If I can – the more I can do in the notification tray, the better.
[2476.28 → 2476.42] Yes.
[2476.42 → 2480.72] Because if I can just do everything I need to without even opening anything, that's fantastic.
[2481.94 → 2486.16] Also, the app I was thinking of was Duo, which was their video chat thing.
[2486.16 → 2490.38] So they launched Allo and Duo at pretty much the same time, and they were both for communicating.
[2490.62 → 2490.72] Yeah.
[2491.70 → 2492.14] Okay.
[2492.24 → 2502.30] But this is not – this is not like a new app that's just another Hangouts or Allo replacement or whatever the case may be.
[2502.36 → 2504.28] This is more of a back-end upgrade.
[2504.52 → 2504.70] Yeah.
[2504.70 → 2504.74] Yeah.
[2505.98 → 2508.22] So they're calling it –
[2508.22 → 2508.66] Rich communication services.
[2508.96 → 2509.64] What is this?
[2509.66 → 2509.78] Yeah.
[2509.84 → 2511.34] Rich communication services.
[2512.14 → 2514.92] So unlike SMS, it'll support video.
[2515.78 → 2517.18] It'll have red receipts.
[2517.84 → 2519.64] It'll support higher res images.
[2520.30 → 2523.22] And the mobile networks will have to opt in.
[2523.48 → 2526.22] But the idea is that –
[2528.22 → 2531.68] And you know, it's a funny thing to me.
[2531.94 → 2533.96] Why do people even care about iMessage that much?
[2535.26 → 2535.94] iMessage is great.
[2535.98 → 2536.50] What are you talking about?
[2536.64 → 2537.26] What's great about it?
[2537.44 → 2537.70] I don't know.
[2537.78 → 2538.66] It just feels nice.
[2539.26 → 2539.92] It goes quick.
[2540.00 → 2541.96] You can tell what phone they have, which is cool.
[2542.90 → 2543.28] I don't know.
[2543.40 → 2545.12] Every time I've had an iPhone, I liked iMessage.
[2545.92 → 2546.22] Right.
[2546.32 → 2550.18] But did it really make a difference to you one way or the other if the bubble was blue or green?
[2550.38 → 2552.60] I mean, SMS sucks, as you know.
[2553.10 → 2555.22] How much better really is Facebook chat?
[2555.38 → 2556.04] It's not.
[2556.04 → 2556.56] It's not.
[2556.68 → 2558.42] The only reason I use Facebook chat is for people –
[2558.42 → 2559.96] So iMessage is great because it's fine.
[2560.12 → 2562.22] Yeah, but Facebook chat has a built-in phone book.
[2562.44 → 2562.80] I don't –
[2562.80 → 2564.44] That's what's useful about Facebook chat.
[2565.70 → 2565.98] Eh.
[2566.10 → 2567.22] I don't have everyone on Facebook.
[2567.58 → 2570.08] Right, but if you wanted to find someone, that's the point of a phone book.
[2570.14 → 2570.92] Not an address book.
[2570.92 → 2573.96] Yeah, but I don't want to add Facebook to having access to all my stuff, though.
[2574.32 → 2574.90] You don't have to.
[2575.10 → 2577.68] You just search Facebook for a person.
[2577.94 → 2579.24] And you're like, oh, right, that person.
[2579.32 → 2580.04] And you contact them.
[2580.04 → 2580.84] Oh.
[2580.84 → 2581.92] Like, that's what I mean by a phone book.
[2581.98 → 2582.70] Not an address book.
[2583.70 → 2584.02] Okay.
[2584.22 → 2585.32] Like a directory.
[2585.82 → 2586.06] Right.
[2586.06 → 2589.88] So that's the only reason I give any FS whatsoever about Facebook Messenger.
[2589.88 → 2591.38] Who do you contact that way on Facebook?
[2591.52 → 2591.74] I don't know.
[2591.78 → 2596.04] Like, people that I, like, met at badminton once and, like, want to play with again sometime,
[2596.26 → 2597.84] but I didn't exchange phone numbers with them.
[2598.66 → 2598.98] Wow.
[2598.98 → 2599.78] But I remember their name.
[2599.92 → 2603.74] Because it'll come up automatically because they'll be friends with a bunch of other badminton people.
[2604.00 → 2604.34] Okay.
[2604.52 → 2609.16] So it'll know, like, if I'm searching for Andy, it'll be like, oh, yeah, probably this Andy,
[2609.26 → 2610.60] even though you don't have him in your contacts.
[2610.94 → 2612.06] I've never used that.
[2612.14 → 2612.32] Yeah.
[2612.32 → 2612.46] Okay.
[2612.46 → 2613.60] It's, like, super useful.
[2613.60 → 2615.20] Or, like, if there was someone that you...
[2615.20 → 2616.06] I don't go outside, so...
[2616.06 → 2618.46] You ran into at a LAN party or something.
[2619.20 → 2620.08] It might know from...
[2620.08 → 2621.46] LAN parties aren't cool anymore.
[2621.56 → 2621.84] I know.
[2622.12 → 2622.26] I know.
[2622.26 → 2622.90] I wish they were.
[2623.20 → 2624.22] I would love that.
[2624.22 → 2631.58] So it might know from their association with other gamers that that's the, you know, Tom Smith that you were most likely to be looking for.
[2631.64 → 2632.24] So it's just...
[2632.24 → 2633.58] That's why I use that.
[2633.66 → 2635.02] That's the only reason I care about that.
[2635.42 → 2638.76] iMessage, other than Anemosis, which is a completely artificial lockdown.
[2638.92 → 2639.44] Thank you, Apple.
[2639.74 → 2644.24] There's no reason why you couldn't send Anemosis as a video clip in Hangouts, for example, other than that.
[2644.24 → 2645.06] They just don't want you to.
[2646.12 → 2647.14] I don't really get it.
[2647.74 → 2648.76] What's so amazing about it?
[2649.06 → 2651.38] Maybe people are telling me in Twitch chat what's so amazing about it.
[2651.40 → 2651.68] There's really...
[2651.68 → 2652.70] There isn't much else, though.
[2653.00 → 2653.68] Group messages.
[2654.78 → 2656.96] On iMessage and WhatsApp are much better than SMS.
[2657.12 → 2659.34] Okay, that's fine, but WhatsApp has that.
[2659.40 → 2660.98] And you can do that on Facebook Messenger.
[2662.70 → 2663.86] iMessage is end-to-end encrypted.
[2664.04 → 2665.04] SMS is open to snooping.
[2665.46 → 2668.16] iMessage is much less creepy than Facebook.
[2668.16 → 2674.92] So if you care about that, then you can be using a third-party messaging service in general.
[2675.12 → 2681.00] Because iMessage is just automatically turned on and turned off, depending on what kind of phone the other person has.
[2681.00 → 2681.64] So it's like...
[2681.64 → 2686.18] It's like only sometimes running your VPN when you talk to some people.
[2686.38 → 2687.74] So I don't really get that either.
[2688.74 → 2689.92] Why don't you use Discord?
[2690.56 → 2691.76] We're talking about privacy stuff.
[2691.76 → 2693.46] I can text on my computer with it, too.
[2693.46 → 2694.78] Okay, yes.
[2694.94 → 2696.48] Integration with the desktop experience.
[2696.48 → 2697.04] That's pretty cool.
[2697.04 → 2697.64] That is a good one.
[2699.44 → 2700.94] Facebook Messenger, same thing.
[2701.08 → 2702.08] WhatsApp, same thing.
[2702.60 → 2703.64] Hangout, same thing.
[2703.64 → 2706.44] People are like, it just works.
[2707.16 → 2708.24] It kind of does, though.
[2708.24 → 2710.08] Yeah, it kind of does, but like...
[2710.08 → 2713.52] And I know it's a funny tagline, but it kind of does just sort of work.
[2714.32 → 2718.50] It just sort of works the way you would expect SMS to, but it doesn't.
[2718.56 → 2719.06] You know what I mean?
[2719.74 → 2731.04] So then in a nutshell, chat is like a back-end upgrade to SMS that other messaging apps, this is cool, like Samsung's messaging app, will support.
[2733.46 → 2737.28] Google actually has a fair number of partners signed on for this thing.
[2737.58 → 2740.82] So, like, I mean, I guess I'm excited, and that's cool.
[2740.82 → 2746.00] But I just, yeah, I guess that's cool.
[2748.54 → 2749.12] I don't know.
[2749.20 → 2753.70] I just, I don't feel like iMessage needed to be something that had to be competed with.
[2754.22 → 2755.14] But apparently it does.
[2755.42 → 2755.58] I do.
[2755.82 → 2765.42] And I guess maybe what I'm forgetting is that a lot of people, like when I message my mom, she doesn't have WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger even or anything.
[2765.96 → 2768.22] Like, to her, text message is text message.
[2768.22 → 2776.80] And so if this upgrades the text message experience that armies are probably just using by default because they don't know anything else, then I guess that's good.
[2777.30 → 2786.54] But even then, we're still not going to have perfect coverage because we're going to be relying on iOS to Android and vice versa to kind of translate to each other.
[2786.62 → 2788.82] But maybe Apple and Google will find a way to cooperate on that.
[2788.86 → 2789.28] I'm not sure.
[2789.34 → 2796.76] I haven't looked into it carefully enough to know if that's, oh, no, yeah, right here in Tom's article, there's no clue whether Apple will support chat.
[2796.76 → 2798.94] So, there you go.
[2799.28 → 2802.52] It's apparently less secure than Apple's own service, so it might be unlikely.
[2803.38 → 2804.60] See, I don't know.
[2804.74 → 2805.68] It seems pretty secure.
[2805.82 → 2809.20] It does everything you really need it to do, and it works all the time.
[2810.18 → 2812.34] And it feels smooth and nice.
[2812.50 → 2812.84] I don't know.
[2813.16 → 2813.88] I like that message.
[2814.66 → 2820.76] It was one of the saddest things about leaving an iPhone was I was like, oh, I have to go back to, like, this weird junk.
[2820.76 → 2830.98] It's just so weird because, like, when Lou did that video at CES where he asked a bunch of creators what phone they're actually using, a couple of people, I think.
[2831.48 → 2832.30] Maybe it was just one.
[2832.38 → 2832.66] I don't know.
[2833.08 → 2834.80] At least one person brought up iMessage.
[2836.06 → 2838.34] And, like, all my friends are on iMessage.
[2839.16 → 2840.54] And so I asked off camera.
[2840.62 → 2841.84] I was like, why does that matter?
[2841.92 → 2842.28] What does that mean?
[2842.38 → 2842.56] Yeah.
[2843.04 → 2843.74] I'm not sure.
[2843.94 → 2844.12] Yeah.
[2844.20 → 2844.86] I'm like, okay.
[2844.86 → 2848.28] I didn't use it enough to actually know because I didn't have an iPhone for very long.
[2848.28 → 2849.88] Is this just really excellent branding?
[2850.54 → 2859.10] Because even a tech content creator, and I'm not going to name who they were, but a tech content creator, tech tuber, didn't know why he cared about iMessage.
[2859.88 → 2860.32] He just...
[2860.32 → 2862.58] My whole thing was it was very smooth.
[2863.12 → 2865.12] I like the idea of text messages.
[2865.26 → 2866.66] I like the idea of default apps.
[2866.88 → 2868.46] I've always liked the idea of default apps.
[2868.54 → 2869.68] I like default experiences.
[2870.18 → 2872.94] I like a Pixel because it is stock Android.
[2872.94 → 2877.40] I would love to use the stock Android SMS thing, but it's Garbo.
[2877.52 → 2885.50] I still have to use it, kind of, because, like, my upstairs neighbours, bless their wonderful souls, use old school text messages.
[2886.78 → 2889.22] And it's kind of bank for that.
[2890.26 → 2893.36] And there are a few other people in my life that I have to use that for.
[2893.54 → 2898.00] I use Facebook Messenger for a lot of my stuff, but that sucks.
[2898.00 → 2903.84] Not only is it, like, scraping everything, it uses a really odd amount of battery life.
[2904.04 → 2905.86] It's terrible in a lot of other ways.
[2906.12 → 2908.00] Got people saying that it's a status symbol.
[2909.72 → 2910.08] Yes.
[2910.98 → 2913.40] Okay, that's not why I like it, but some people do see it that way.
[2913.52 → 2919.24] If you pop up in the iMessage with the like, I have an iPhone colour, it's, like, a positive thing.
[2919.38 → 2920.58] I didn't even remember which one it was.
[2920.68 → 2921.94] I use it for a very short period of time.
[2921.94 → 2924.74] I did know that I really liked my iMessage experience.
[2925.34 → 2933.48] I texted more people when I was on an iPhone because I had iMessage, and I texted fewer people when I was on an Android because I didn't have iMessage.
[2933.66 → 2936.18] Because the stock texting thing sucks so bad.
[2936.40 → 2943.98] I used to have something called Goss Pro, like, a long time ago, when texting was still really popular.
[2944.12 → 2949.90] Because the default Android messaging thing was so garbage that I got Goss Pro.
[2949.90 → 2953.04] But then something happened there, I don't remember what it was, and they were bad.
[2953.18 → 2955.04] I think I just hate everyone who has these problems.
[2955.36 → 2957.78] Because they clearly have social lives, and I don't.
[2958.16 → 2958.68] You know what?
[2958.70 → 2963.00] You're the one that needs the like, the address book.
[2963.04 → 2963.38] You know what?
[2963.52 → 2963.74] No.
[2964.46 → 2966.94] In, in freaking Messenger.
[2967.08 → 2968.54] Well, I didn't say I used it often.
[2968.78 → 2969.96] Because you meet so many people out playing Abington.
[2969.96 → 2971.12] I didn't say it was so many people.
[2971.12 → 2972.20] That you need to look them up.
[2972.24 → 2974.62] I can prove to you that it's, like, three ever, actually.
[2978.82 → 2979.74] Well, I'm at zero.
[2979.90 → 2980.14] Okay?
[2980.36 → 2983.32] So, you're winning by a lot.
[2983.64 → 2988.66] Speaking of zero, that's how many new products will be developed by Opp Digital.
[2989.38 → 2992.06] So, this was posted on the forum by someone.
[2992.58 → 2993.50] Nick the Main.
[2993.74 → 2994.52] Nick the Main?
[2994.66 → 2995.34] Whatever that is.
[2995.38 → 2995.80] Main.
[2996.26 → 2997.18] Very sad day.
[2997.90 → 2999.90] Opp, and this is Nick's editorial.
[3000.62 → 3005.24] Opp made the best video players on the market with superb build quality and fantastic customer support.
[3005.24 → 3008.74] Guess the market just wasn't there for the higher-end product.
[3008.86 → 3015.12] I love my UDP 203 and hate to think that my next player will have to be made of cheap plastic from the likes of Sony or Samsung.
[3015.12 → 3027.90] So, for those of you not familiar, Opp was a brand that I already couldn't understand why they existed back in, like, 2012?
[3027.90 → 3029.72] 2011?
[3029.72 → 3029.92] 2011?
[3030.52 → 3040.44] So, this is when I was a product manager back at NCI, and one of my fellow product managers was going to bring in these high-end DVD players and Blu-ray players,
[3040.44 → 3046.86] with the argument being that they had sort of fancy upscaling technology and stuff.
[3047.72 → 3052.98] And they were very expensive, and I kind of went, are you effing kidding me?
[3053.30 → 3055.94] Like, high-end DVD players?
[3056.44 → 3062.76] That's kind of like trying to sell premium cassette tapes, as far as I'm concerned, for which I'm sure there's a market.
[3063.62 → 3064.58] Oh, there totally is.
[3065.86 → 3067.76] Okay, let me come up with something better.
[3067.94 → 3068.32] RetroWave.
[3068.32 → 3072.74] How about, like, stylish dad sandals?
[3073.50 → 3075.60] Like, okay, I would, you know what?
[3075.60 → 3075.76] You.
[3076.62 → 3077.54] Okay, um.
[3080.74 → 3081.84] I'm working on this.
[3083.14 → 3087.44] Okay, so there's a niche for almost anything, but not for this, apparently, anymore.
[3087.92 → 3090.00] Synth wave, or new RetroWave.
[3090.12 → 3090.98] They like cassette tapes.
[3091.66 → 3091.88] Okay.
[3091.88 → 3098.66] So we've gotten past the point where anyone, or at least enough people to sustain this company,
[3098.66 → 3104.82] care enough about fancy upscaling features and better build quality on their physical media players.
[3105.40 → 3107.74] Now, I do still buy Blu-rays.
[3108.74 → 3109.16] Me too.
[3109.16 → 3109.64] Periodically.
[3109.64 → 3109.68] Periodically.
[3110.14 → 3114.40] Because it is, it does look a lot better than streaming.
[3114.40 → 3119.80] But man, is Blu-ray ever going to get replaced?
[3119.98 → 3122.02] Like, will there be a successor, or are we just done?
[3122.40 → 3123.00] I think we're done.
[3124.62 → 3125.02] Huh.
[3125.02 → 3130.08] I mean, it's at the point now where it's just.
[3130.18 → 3131.92] People have kind of voted with their wallets.
[3132.02 → 3132.86] They want cheaper.
[3132.96 → 3133.80] They don't want higher quality.
[3134.64 → 3143.74] And it's gotten to the point where I think the cheaper option is so much cheaper that a lot of people don't think it's worth it.
[3144.10 → 3146.76] So they're still going to be providing support and doing updates, but.
[3147.64 → 3148.04] I mean.
[3148.86 → 3155.52] And at the same time, to be fair, like a high-end Blu-ray player, I think is a little bit harder to explain the value of.
[3156.14 → 3157.54] Like a lot of people are going to.
[3157.80 → 3158.20] Yeah.
[3158.28 → 3159.28] Go with like their PlayStation.
[3159.68 → 3159.88] Yeah.
[3160.00 → 3160.58] Or whatever else.
[3160.70 → 3161.02] I sure would.
[3161.14 → 3161.44] Built in.
[3161.44 → 3162.22] Xbox One S.
[3162.40 → 3162.98] Yeah, exactly.
[3163.10 → 3163.50] That's what I'm saying.
[3163.68 → 3164.52] Yeah, PlayStation doesn't.
[3164.86 → 3165.04] Oh.
[3165.14 → 3166.62] No Blu-ray player in the PS4 Pro.
[3166.78 → 3167.06] Right.
[3167.28 → 3167.76] Didn't know that.
[3167.90 → 3168.04] Yeah.
[3168.48 → 3172.10] But like, yeah, I feel like they would go with.
[3172.86 → 3173.20] What?
[3173.78 → 3174.24] How did that work?
[3174.24 → 3174.60] Hold on.
[3174.60 → 3175.16] I might be.
[3175.30 → 3176.08] I might have that wrong.
[3176.46 → 3176.76] Yeah.
[3176.76 → 3179.40] I played a Blu-ray in a PS4 Pro.
[3179.68 → 3181.46] Like, not even a Pro.
[3181.58 → 3181.78] Hold on.
[3181.82 → 3182.32] I might have that wrong.
[3182.36 → 3183.18] What is the stupid thing?
[3183.26 → 3183.76] Ultra HD.
[3183.96 → 3184.14] Sorry.
[3184.32 → 3186.08] That was the stupid thing that it didn't have.
[3186.46 → 3190.54] Xbox One S has support for 4K Blu-ray and the PS4 Pro doesn't.
[3190.58 → 3191.32] I was like, wait a minute.
[3191.42 → 3191.62] No, no.
[3191.68 → 3192.66] The PS3 had Blu-ray.
[3193.02 → 3193.18] Yeah.
[3193.34 → 3193.50] Okay.
[3193.62 → 3193.78] Sorry.
[3193.84 → 3193.96] Go ahead.
[3193.98 → 3195.14] I was pretty confused for a second there.
[3195.36 → 3200.60] But yeah, I think people use an existing device, or they would rather go buy something that
[3200.60 → 3205.34] can do a bunch of other stuff and play Blu-rays instead of something that just plays Blu-rays.
[3205.34 → 3210.24] Speaking of other things dead, Intel's smart glasses group, gone.
[3211.56 → 3216.38] The glasses they were working on called Vaunt looked kind of like normal glasses and used
[3216.38 → 3219.00] a low-powered laser beam to beam images into the eye.
[3220.48 → 3225.70] So either Intel is giving up on AR for a while or they figured they were never going to get
[3225.70 → 3230.44] laser beams into your eye past the regulatory bodies that pay attention to that sort of thing.
[3230.44 → 3233.56] Which I think, honestly, both of those options are totally valid.
[3236.66 → 3240.64] Because I think, how is this not a much more major topic?
[3240.82 → 3241.58] Well, we're talking about this.
[3242.20 → 3242.50] Okay.
[3242.66 → 3247.10] GeForce Partner Program is, well, we kind of talked about it a little bit last week,
[3247.18 → 3248.78] but it looks like it's official.
[3248.78 → 3253.10] Asus has announced, the original article here is from Hot Hardware.
[3253.32 → 3254.34] You weren't here last week.
[3254.72 → 3255.40] A week before?
[3256.76 → 3257.40] I don't know.
[3257.82 → 3258.04] Okay.
[3258.50 → 3261.56] Ares, Ares, Ares video cards.
[3261.70 → 3264.10] No, I read the article where it was rumoured.
[3264.36 → 3265.96] I talked about it on WAN Show at some point.
[3266.24 → 3266.68] Oh, okay.
[3266.80 → 3267.46] But this is it.
[3267.52 → 3268.06] It's official.
[3268.06 → 3276.14] DOG is out for Asus's high-end gaming products that feature AMD processors.
[3276.80 → 3285.40] So this is Ares, which is a play on Asus's Ares with an S, not a Z, high-end, like, dual-GPU AMD Radeon cards
[3285.40 → 3290.28] that were, like, a limited edition, similar to their Mars ones for NVIDIA.
[3290.28 → 3294.70] So just a summary for those of you who aren't familiar.
[3295.78 → 3301.88] The program rewards partners with perks, including marketing funds, special promotions, and extra engineering support.
[3302.42 → 3306.82] And Asus has not gone on the record saying it joined the program, but with the release of Ares,
[3307.54 → 3312.16] it is fairly clear that Republic of Gamers will only be used on GeForce cards
[3312.16 → 3316.94] and other products containing an NVIDIA processor.
[3316.94 → 3319.94] La-di-da!
[3321.84 → 3322.28] Intense.
[3322.48 → 3323.20] Have you seen this?
[3324.66 → 3326.00] I have no idea what this is.
[3326.12 → 3327.32] Yeah, it's lame.
[3327.90 → 3329.88] It's just stupid marketing junk.
[3330.56 → 3335.34] So, yeah, speaking of stupid marketing junk, that's it for the WAN Show.
[3335.58 → 3335.90] Yeah.
[3336.58 → 3337.72] The marketing junk show.
[3338.30 → 3338.68] No.
[3339.70 → 3340.80] There's more to it than that.
[3341.04 → 3342.48] I ate jerky for half of this show.
[3342.72 → 3344.96] Yeah, I was going to say we eat stuff.
[3344.96 → 3346.14] They don't pay extra for that, though.
[3346.14 → 3347.14] And drink some water.
[3347.24 → 3347.76] It's just yummy.
[3348.18 → 3348.32] Yeah.
[3349.76 → 3350.20] Cool.
[3351.00 → 3351.96] So let's see you again next week.
[3352.02 → 3353.16] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3353.50 → 3353.82] Bye!
[3358.40 → 3360.56] I don't know what it is, but like, I didn't even check the time.
[3361.32 → 3362.62] But it's been like, exactly an hour.
[3364.08 → 3365.14] And it's just something about...
[3365.14 → 3367.42] The WAN Show.
[3367.42 → 3368.64] It takes exactly an hour.
[3370.22 → 3374.48] I think part of it, honestly, is James has written so many docs now.
[3374.98 → 3376.46] No, this is what John helped me this week.
[3376.84 → 3377.00] Oh.
[3377.26 → 3377.46] Yeah.
[3379.52 → 3380.50] Forgot float plane.
[3381.24 → 3381.64] Dang it.
[3382.08 → 3382.28] No.
[3382.28 → 3382.70] We'll come back.
[3382.76 → 3383.60] No, we're going back.
[3383.70 → 3384.20] We're going back.
[3384.64 → 3385.28] We're coming back.
[3386.22 → 3388.02] It's like an after party, but not after.
[3388.14 → 3390.20] It's like a post party, but not post.
[3390.20 → 3395.80] I'm going to say that we didn't, because we technically talked about it at the beginning
[3395.80 → 3399.74] of the show, but we didn't highlight the cool things that are on it, so we also did.
[3400.84 → 3401.32] Here we go.
[3401.54 → 3402.24] Oh, dang it.
[3402.86 → 3403.28] I would probably...
[3403.84 → 3404.10] Yep.
[3404.28 → 3404.68] Just a sec.
[3405.24 → 3405.76] There we go.
[3406.12 → 3406.42] Hey.
[3406.82 → 3407.64] We're still here.
[3407.64 → 3409.04] I don't know.
[3409.04 → 3410.28] You didn't stop and start, right?
[3410.34 → 3411.20] Like, we're just still going?
[3411.32 → 3411.44] Mm-hmm.
[3411.58 → 3411.90] Nice.
[3412.00 → 3414.86] My fingers are really jerky, though.
[3415.22 → 3415.50] Oh.
[3415.60 → 3418.94] I'm not making it much better by licking them and then wiping them on my pants, but...
[3418.94 → 3419.00] Oh.
[3420.06 → 3420.66] Um...
[3420.66 → 3422.34] Yeah.
[3422.96 → 3423.64] Yes, AJ.
[3423.84 → 3425.42] You completely saved the day.
[3425.56 → 3425.94] Good job.
[3428.90 → 3429.44] All right.
[3429.50 → 3430.58] Let's see if I...
[3430.58 → 3437.04] Also, I noticed that you logged on to Battlegrounds at 2.58 local time.
[3437.64 → 3440.30] So, we're going to need to talk on Monday.
[3440.86 → 3442.24] But thank you for saving the day.
[3442.80 → 3443.64] I appreciate it.
[3444.90 → 3445.76] Okay, then.
[3447.68 → 3449.00] Screen sharing with Linus.
[3450.00 → 3451.62] Let's go ahead and put that there.
[3452.32 → 3453.54] So, what do we have up there?
[3454.08 → 3456.26] Oh, this is a Tech Quickie.
[3456.34 → 3460.50] That is actually a very unusual-looking thumbnail for a Tech Quickie video.
[3461.46 → 3461.90] Interesting.
[3462.00 → 3463.86] That's an unusual-looking host for a Tech Quickie video.
[3463.94 → 3466.26] Actually, John's done a lot of the hosting on Tech Quickie lately,
[3466.26 → 3467.94] and the reception's been perfect.
[3470.30 → 3471.42] Let's go ahead and go back.
[3472.26 → 3474.24] See how snappy that site is and that beautiful?
[3474.38 → 3474.54] Hey.
[3474.96 → 3477.28] Here's our We're Hiring video in case Colton gets fired.
[3477.34 → 3478.98] You can't really tell, but he's, like, cowering.
[3479.16 → 3479.46] It's great.
[3479.68 → 3480.16] Okay, yeah.
[3480.24 → 3480.40] Yeah.
[3480.62 → 3481.20] It's pretty wonderful.
[3481.20 → 3487.58] So, this went up simultaneously because there was an embargo super no one cared, hey, about Ry zen 2.
[3487.92 → 3488.26] Really?
[3488.46 → 3488.84] Yeah.
[3489.18 → 3495.62] It was, like, it was not only not, like, a big momentum spike for the channel, but it was, like, devastating.
[3495.84 → 3496.24] Slow down?
[3496.46 → 3497.16] Oh, wow.
[3497.16 → 3498.94] It, like, crushed the channel.
[3500.90 → 3503.22] This one is going to blow up on YouTube.
[3503.66 → 3506.42] Faster internet for free in 30 seconds, and it works.
[3507.26 → 3508.86] Do you know about Cloudflare's DNS?
[3509.58 → 3509.92] Yes.
[3510.08 → 3510.58] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3510.58 → 3510.78] Yeah.
[3510.78 → 3513.68] So, we basically just show people how to change their DNS to a faster one.
[3513.68 → 3513.88] Okay.
[3515.24 → 3515.98] No, that's cool.
[3516.04 → 3516.38] That's cool.
[3516.46 → 3516.76] That's cool.
[3516.88 → 3517.20] That's cool.
[3517.20 → 3517.22] That's cool.
[3517.22 → 3517.50] Yeah.
[3517.50 → 3520.74] I might say snappier.
[3521.82 → 3522.78] Well, you know what?
[3522.80 → 3523.12] But, you know.
[3523.48 → 3524.06] You know what?
[3527.84 → 3537.38] I won't destroy my principles, but I won't compromise my principles, but I might be flexible.
[3538.92 → 3539.32] Sometimes.
[3541.74 → 3543.34] Technically, you might be correct.
[3543.50 → 3544.78] I don't think it's too brutal.
[3545.00 → 3546.26] I don't think this is far off.
[3546.28 → 3547.28] Yeah, I think it's fine.
[3547.52 → 3548.88] Self-driving car levels explained.
[3548.96 → 3550.08] That's another Fast as Possible.
[3550.28 → 3550.72] That's cool.
[3551.02 → 3554.98] It's really cool because a lot of people don't realize that there's, I think, six levels?
[3555.36 → 3555.88] Something like that?
[3555.96 → 3556.42] Six levels.
[3556.54 → 3558.38] Like, level four is not actually the end.
[3558.50 → 3558.68] Yeah.
[3559.26 → 3560.24] So, that's really cool.
[3560.96 → 3563.20] The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Review is up.
[3563.70 → 3566.60] Oh, I don't know how much Intel's going to like this video.
[3567.40 → 3569.54] Leon W is basically...
[3569.54 → 3570.90] Oh, that's fun.
[3570.90 → 3572.20] Core i9 with ECC.
[3572.50 → 3573.52] And, by the way, here's...
[3573.52 → 3574.76] Pay another $700, please.
[3574.76 → 3578.56] Um, but it's still worth watching the video.
[3578.76 → 3579.82] We go into it in more detail.
[3580.42 → 3583.04] This video ended up being, like, pretty brutal.
[3583.42 → 3586.94] I was thinking it was just going to be me and Dennis kind of, like, racing to build a PC.
[3587.54 → 3590.60] Instead, it was Dennis trying to build a PC at all.
[3590.84 → 3593.74] Oh, jeez.
[3593.74 → 3595.84] This video is actually fantastic.
[3596.04 → 3596.88] Also, AJ, I know.
[3596.98 → 3598.22] I'm just yanking your chain.
[3598.36 → 3599.20] We, uh...
[3599.20 → 3600.92] We really mixed things up a little bit.
[3601.10 → 3601.54] Oh, my.
[3601.96 → 3603.40] Um, so we kind of like...
[3603.40 → 3603.58] What the heck?
[3604.84 → 3606.12] Uh, so I'm baking a...
[3606.12 → 3607.36] I'm baking a laptop cake.
[3607.84 → 3609.28] That's kind of the idea behind it.
[3610.02 → 3612.40] Oh, and these are all the things you want in a...
[3612.40 → 3612.90] You know, yeah.
[3613.12 → 3613.48] Okay.
[3613.62 → 3615.46] And so the point that we're making is that...
[3615.46 → 3616.56] You went really far with this.
[3616.56 → 3620.10] Just because you have the right ingredients doesn't mean that you actually make a delicious cake.
[3620.82 → 3621.26] Wow.
[3621.36 → 3623.00] You might get a couple of things wrong, you know?
[3623.68 → 3624.08] Brutal.
[3624.90 → 3627.12] So we've got the magic transition there.
[3627.36 → 3628.22] Isn't that beautiful?
[3629.30 → 3635.48] Alex actually went and had a custom cake made for this video, Dell XPS 2018.
[3641.58 → 3643.00] And we're going to leave it there.
[3643.86 → 3644.30] Okay.
[3644.52 → 3645.82] I haven't seen that.
[3645.82 → 3646.84] I need to see that.
[3647.58 → 3648.46] That's pretty good.
[3648.64 → 3650.54] Uh, we've got the wearable keyboard and mouse.
[3650.70 → 3650.94] Yes.
[3651.20 → 3651.36] Yeah.
[3651.36 → 3654.76] So it's both a keyboard and a mouse, and it just fits on your hand like that.
[3655.08 → 3656.78] I think we're getting into already released.
[3656.78 → 3657.82] And I think that's, uh...
[3657.82 → 3660.42] I think, yeah, that's getting into the stuff that's already released now, I think.
[3661.04 → 3661.28] Yep.
[3662.18 → 3663.60] Oh, also, Kyle's on the platform.
[3663.96 → 3664.26] Yeah.
[3664.82 → 3665.82] Whoopee, whoopee, whoopee, whoop.
[3666.70 → 3667.88] So he's got...
[3667.88 → 3669.44] That probably went up on the embargo.
[3670.12 → 3670.74] Oh, wow.
[3671.42 → 3671.84] Uh-oh.
[3672.48 → 3673.34] Yeah, okay.
[3673.76 → 3674.70] That's not fake.
[3675.10 → 3675.68] No, it's not.
[3675.68 → 3676.58] That's real coolant.
[3676.74 → 3677.10] It is.
[3677.20 → 3677.82] That's a problem.
[3678.06 → 3678.30] Yep.
[3679.26 → 3679.88] I've seen that.
[3679.96 → 3683.32] So at some point, we're going to get this new button fixed so that you can tell the difference
[3683.32 → 3684.68] between stuff that's just been uploaded.
[3684.82 → 3685.00] Everything's new.
[3685.10 → 3685.82] Everything is new.
[3685.94 → 3687.60] Everything ever uploaded is new.
[3687.66 → 3688.42] Everything is new.
[3688.46 → 3689.24] It's a new website.
[3689.66 → 3690.44] New thumbnail.
[3690.52 → 3692.38] But genuinely, there are some new things over on Float plane.
[3692.46 → 3692.90] Go check them out.
[3693.14 → 3693.90] New comment.
[3694.38 → 3695.20] Floatplane.com.
[3695.20 → 3697.34] Someone new viewed it recently.
[3697.34 → 3697.36] Someone new viewed it recently.
