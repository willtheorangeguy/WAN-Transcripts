[0.00 --> 5.50]  earlier this week did you did you tune into that disaster by any chance were you streaming it while
[5.50 --> 12.74]  i was at work uh no oh well still no okay fair enough um so i did like a 10-year anniversary
[12.74 --> 17.66]  stream with yvonne as kind of uh you and yvonne have been together 10 years no no we have well
[17.66 --> 22.68]  we've been together longer than that's really ambiguous yeah so it was 10 the 10-year linus
[22.68 --> 29.86]  tech tips anniversary okay so linus tech tips was started on the 25th of november 25th 26th
[29.86 --> 39.08]  whatever it was 25th or 26th of november 2008 10 years ago this whole enterprise began and uh so
[39.08 --> 46.40]  i thought it might be a cool idea to do like kind of a behind the scenes slash like q a uh like a get
[46.40 --> 51.40]  to know you for yvonne because a lot of people think that like i brought my wife to work kind of
[51.40 --> 56.62]  thing like there's been a lot of comments about like what's his wife doing at work and what does
[56.62 --> 66.38]  that mean ridiculous it means that like okay and to be clear i get it because i worked at a place
[66.38 --> 71.06]  where the boss brought his wife to work what does brought your wife work mean brought your wife to
[71.06 --> 80.12]  work means that for some reason the owner of the company's wife is there every day and
[80.12 --> 88.86]  barking orders at people even though she clearly has no idea what's going on so in that if someone
[88.86 --> 96.06]  were to do that does that does the boss's wife uh have formal employment there yes okay she did in
[96.06 --> 103.46]  this case and of course yvonne does here yeah so a lot of people seem to think that that's how things
[103.46 --> 109.42]  went down but it's not at all she's actually been involved since basically day one um and so i thought it
[109.42 --> 114.08]  would be cool to do like a stream to like kind of get to know her and find out you know what's what's
[114.08 --> 120.52]  going on or what she's done here over the years uh because it's not insignificant at all and i think
[120.52 --> 125.18]  it's just you're just lucky that your wife happened to be competent is that the only difference here
[125.18 --> 133.58]  um no because i don't see any reason why i would have involved her if she hadn't been yeah like and
[133.58 --> 141.98]  it's not just that like she drove me to make almost every major career decision that i have made
[141.98 --> 146.96]  in the last like we've actually been together like 13 years or something like that's been quite a long
[146.96 --> 152.72]  time only married for eight of it though um so so she was the one actually driving me she drove me to
[152.72 --> 160.64]  drop out of school which to be clear was actually the correct decision for me um she only drove me to do
[160.64 --> 163.98]  that not because she doesn't believe in school she finished her degree she just knew it would have
[163.98 --> 171.28]  taken linus forever to graduate maybe the plan was dependence she figured if i didn't get educated
[171.28 --> 176.92]  then i'd be stuck with her um yeah a lot of people don't know this actually that's another thing uh
[176.92 --> 180.42]  there's a lot of speculation that she's a gold digger actually
[180.42 --> 189.60]  she had much better prospects when we met than i did she's a pharmacist uh yes i don't know why she
[189.60 --> 196.84]  works here um so she was so she was in uh she was in pharmacy school when i met her so she had just
[196.84 --> 202.16]  she wasn't in the pharmacy program yet when we started dating but she got in shortly after we
[202.16 --> 208.14]  started dating so she was on a very clear trajectory and i was on academic probation
[208.14 --> 214.90]  at ubc at that time so i was on a very clear trajectory as well why are we on probation i was
[214.90 --> 219.36]  on sexual harassment smoking in the boys room academic probation for getting poor grades
[219.36 --> 224.98]  academic probation so it was gonna take you forever to graduate if i ever did no i would
[224.98 --> 229.82]  have gotten kicked out the only reason i didn't get kicked out was because i left you can't kick me
[229.82 --> 234.56]  out because i quit i'm out of here i'm out of here like they wouldn't i don't think they would
[234.56 --> 241.40]  ever let me back in that school so um where were you taking i was taking general science and i
[241.40 --> 245.92]  couldn't pass calculus for the life of me she was your tutor was she not uh she was my tutor but that
[245.92 --> 252.92]  was only because there was an interest that was not because i was like out looking for a tutor i just
[252.92 --> 256.74]  wouldn't have found a tutor and i would have probably gotten an even worse grade if not for her
[256.74 --> 262.40]  and that would have been impressive actually because i got 19 the first time around
[262.40 --> 271.04]  in calc 101 or 100 or whatever it is um so so anyway what what were we talking about right so
[271.04 --> 277.54]  anyway i so i remember making this joke at the time because i was around the time that i was dropping
[277.54 --> 284.88]  out to work for as a sales rep at a computer store and uh i so i forget what someone said to me but
[284.88 --> 289.46]  something like you know you know your wife's gonna be the breadwinner in the future like this is
[289.46 --> 293.42]  speculation we weren't even close to getting married at that point and i kind of went yeah
[293.42 --> 300.46]  you know what we live in enlightened times you know there's men can go to university for their
[300.46 --> 306.02]  mrs these days there's nothing wrong with that because there's this old sexist joke that men go
[306.02 --> 312.22]  to school men go to college or men go to university for their bas their mas and their phds and what do
[312.22 --> 317.88]  women go to university for their mrs and so i was like so it's kind of like a play on that
[317.88 --> 324.62]  very terrible joke it means misses yeah it means they're gonna it means like marrying someone who's
[324.62 --> 330.46]  gonna have a ba and na or a phd that's so anyway i that that was all that i got out of school was my
[330.46 --> 340.64]  mrs yeah uh well i mean i think it's like the trend is the other way now like almost the majority of
[340.64 --> 345.84]  couples couples i know the woman makes more really in my wife's friend group it's like that huh
[345.84 --> 350.78]  yeah maybe your wife's friend group though is just like highly educated highly driven women and
[350.78 --> 354.38]  maybe that's not necessarily well they're not highly educated they are highly driven they're all in
[354.38 --> 362.52]  sales sales just that's where the money's at sales is actually super underrated in terms of like oh you
[362.52 --> 367.80]  have grade 10 and you want to make 200 000 a year sales yeah career and personal planning should
[367.80 --> 372.68]  probably focus on sales skills and hold on give me one second i want to finish that thought from
[372.68 --> 377.68]  before the point is we tried to do that stream i managed to fail three times over the course of
[377.68 --> 383.36]  like four days we finally got it done last night go check it out like calculus um yeah actually my
[383.36 --> 390.82]  grade in streaming is slightly higher than calculus 25 uh it's so weird because in this world in this
[390.82 --> 397.44]  studio and in the youtube world and this computer world like you know you're the master of your domain
[397.44 --> 401.58]  here in this in this little linus world we live in and it's weird for me to think of linus like
[401.58 --> 406.96]  looking at a piece of paper and just being like i don't get it i don't know what to do i'm failing
[406.96 --> 413.04]  i was so frustrated like forget it i give up i can't think about this right now i'm just gonna go
[413.04 --> 420.34]  play counter-strike that was that was and she was like well you should you should just give up you
[420.34 --> 425.72]  should drop out it was less that it was more that i was sinking worse and worse into depression
[425.72 --> 432.04]  and clearly what i was doing with the painting business and school um where nothing was a success
[432.04 --> 439.10]  was not helping and this actually segues so perfectly into our talk about how important sales is
[439.10 --> 445.72]  because all of a sudden i had this opportunity to take this job at the computer store that was
[445.72 --> 452.18]  not a ton of money but because there was a commission there was the potential to kind of scale it
[452.18 --> 459.52]  and i was really passionate about it like i got a job at ncix because i was that kid on their forum
[459.52 --> 468.68]  that was constantly already a salesman and an ethical one like i wasn't about people just buying
[468.68 --> 473.24]  more i wasn't i wasn't even on commission i didn't even i wasn't even on the company payroll i was just
[473.24 --> 480.50]  hanging out on their forum because the ncix forum was quite frankly the shiz back in like the mid 2000s
[480.50 --> 485.98]  it was awesome it was super active great community there fantastic people can't say enough
[485.98 --> 493.04]  um cam you know who you are you're awesome anyway you're cam you're cam um but uh but anyway so i was
[493.04 --> 498.38]  already this kid hanging out on their forum basically doing the sales job which is advising people of what
[498.38 --> 504.56]  the right thing to buy is and helping them pick it and and making them making that relationship to ncix
[504.56 --> 511.18]  make it more likely that they probably buy it from ncix so even though they thought i was too young
[511.18 --> 516.74]  and they were looking for full-time people and i was only available part-time uh they made this this
[516.74 --> 524.68]  kind of this weird exception for me and i and i started my job there and it was it's amazing how much of
[524.68 --> 532.74]  life is sales and how applicable the sales skills that i kind of gained just by being an enthusiast and
[532.74 --> 539.36]  getting a job where my whole job was just to talk about my passion all day it's amazing how that
[539.36 --> 547.26]  is actually a big part of how i was able to end up where i am today and i i'll preach i'll preach sales
[547.26 --> 554.74]  training and and sales skills all day to anyone who will listen because if you think about it what in
[554.74 --> 559.26]  life is not sales engineering
[559.26 --> 566.46]  yes but i would make the argument that without sales there's always aspects right the engineers
[566.46 --> 570.64]  are probably in trouble you got to make your pitch you got to make your pitch to get the funding to
[570.64 --> 576.40]  build the thing sure get the project approved sure there's sales and engineering come on well i mean
[576.40 --> 580.80]  youtube chat give me something here it's synonymous with communication when you're going to be
[580.80 --> 586.32]  abstracted like that yes so and everything's communicating finding a finding a partner in
[586.32 --> 592.64]  life sales you've got it you got to sell them on what's have i got a deal for you what's good about
[592.64 --> 601.26]  you you know why why they should care why they should go on that first date that's sales sales is all
[601.26 --> 607.80]  about persuasive communication and calling it sales i think is sort of unfair it's just that that's
[607.80 --> 614.72]  usually the word at the end of whatever job title it is or associate or whatever whatever it's like
[614.72 --> 621.22]  the whole secretary receptionist thing you know uh uh garbage men waste management you know technician
[621.22 --> 626.88]  whatever it it's if we're being honest with ourselves it's it's sales but i think that also
[626.88 --> 632.98]  isn't really fair to the complexity of that position because it's all about building relationships and
[632.98 --> 640.36]  getting to know people and if you are genuinely good at it actually caring actually building real
[640.36 --> 648.10]  relationships that still exist beyond cutting the po and making the payment transactional that's not
[648.10 --> 653.22]  real sales and i think that's where a lot of sales training sucks well actually sales has changed in the
[653.22 --> 657.92]  last couple decades because there used to be an information disparity between the customer and the
[657.92 --> 662.66]  salesperson where you walked in to buy a car you were dependent on the salesperson to tell you
[662.66 --> 667.16]  everything about the car because you had no way of finding that stuff out by yourself now we have
[667.16 --> 672.22]  the internet everyone has access to information you walk in the store knowing more about the thing you
[672.22 --> 677.86]  want to buy than the salesperson does so where in the past extra extroverts they really thrived as
[677.86 --> 683.46]  salespeople before now it's more of kind of you need to be in the middle of that spectrum so that you
[683.46 --> 688.94]  can listen to what the person already knows and what they want and then just help kind of funnel them
[688.94 --> 696.34]  and then plinko game to the best solution mathematics research linus even then like you probably have to
[696.34 --> 701.68]  apply for like research grants and stuff you have to you have to get a job and like get tenure at a
[701.68 --> 705.38]  university or something before anyone's going to actually pay you to do mathematics research
[705.38 --> 709.68]  i don't know yeah it's a little it's a little tenuous because what you're talking about is true but
[709.68 --> 713.98]  it might be like two percent of their actual day-to-day job yes that's true plus they're going to get the
[713.98 --> 720.56]  tenure after publishing a bunch fair enough fair enough people have are we going to do news today
[720.56 --> 724.62]  are we going to roll the intro sure let's roll the intro no promises on the news though
[724.62 --> 729.26]  oops oh right okay there we go yeah
[729.26 --> 758.86]  mo as moss moss moss organizer dang it james take the space out moss oh
[758.86 --> 763.42]  gneiser all right all right all right all right all right i don't want james to be upset
[763.42 --> 769.84]  so we will do one tech news topic today the one that upsets me the most the one that upsets
[769.84 --> 776.30]  not just you both of us the most oh crap that well that's my document i mean i guess i kind of
[776.30 --> 783.50]  spoiled it without actually going to the bizjournals.com jibo is dead no no anyone but jibo
[783.50 --> 791.42]  no not jibo he was an innocent he was pure of mine i don't know how pure he was with all that
[791.42 --> 802.14]  all that twerking that was going on not jibo oh this was jibo oh rest in peace jibo okay i know that
[802.14 --> 808.14]  half of you are going to get ben from the chat for but can we all please just press f
[808.14 --> 817.82]  press f to pay respects to jibo please poor jibo and this is about what it looks like to me
[817.82 --> 821.18]  stop the crying voice whenever other youtubers do apology videos
[824.78 --> 829.98]  they're so bad they're so fake anyway yeah so jibo is a company doesn't exist anymore this is why i never
[829.98 --> 836.54]  apologize for anything because i know you guys are too smart for that kind of crap actually i apologize
[836.54 --> 842.62]  you should apologize for pandering uh who who do i pander to okay so no i'm serious no no no we'll
[842.62 --> 848.30]  do the news later just now who do i pander to when you just said you guys are too smart well they are
[849.10 --> 854.46]  i i think our audience is genuine okay tell you what i have a i have an exercise for you
[856.54 --> 865.42]  set aside 20 minutes okay spend 10 minutes clicking on random ltt videos and reading like the top 10
[865.42 --> 873.98]  comments and just kind of going through then log out of youtube and like fire up a vpn or something
[873.98 --> 879.50]  so that doesn't know who you are and just start clicking on like top videos on youtube and reading
[879.50 --> 884.30]  the top 10 comments on each of them come back and tell me our audience isn't a little smarter okay you're
[884.30 --> 892.30]  right this is subject this is objective okay this is not pandering this is just actual fact uh anyway
[892.30 --> 897.82]  tell me tell me about tell me about jibo what what happened to jibo oh man okay well let's just go
[897.82 --> 902.38]  through the points here uh just a year after jibo landed on the cover of time magazine
[903.66 --> 908.30]  let that sink in that was a whole lot this is a whole other rant whole other problem like time
[909.02 --> 916.94]  officially is a rag they they made a listicle of their like 10 most innovative tech products
[916.94 --> 922.22]  they didn't even try it obviously not only did they not try it they didn't even read a review or
[922.22 --> 931.18]  watch a video because everyone was unanimous it was so bad it was just so useless sorry yeah jibo
[931.18 --> 936.22]  sucked okay anyway there's parts that were good just a year after jibo landed on the cover of time
[936.22 --> 941.82]  magazine the company has closed down for good jibo apparently sold its intellectual property assets to
[941.82 --> 948.86]  new york based sqn venture partners who apparently are like the vultures of the venture world and um
[949.58 --> 955.02]  evidence of jibo's decline has been accumulating for months including a round of layoffs in june
[955.90 --> 961.10]  an empty office space in july these are these are this are these are evidence these are flags
[961.10 --> 967.02]  these are flags these are red flags the blog hasn't been updated since may there's no longer an option to
[967.02 --> 972.14]  buy jibo on the website although the website is still operational okay is it really okay i'm gonna
[972.14 --> 980.70]  fire that up now go ahead carry on founded in 2012 uh i believe by a was an mit professor who studied uh
[981.34 --> 986.62]  social robotics yeah something to do with like robotic movement her last name was like similar to the
[986.62 --> 991.98]  word brazil anyway founded in 2012 the company was right uh the company raised more than 3.5 million
[991.98 --> 998.62]  dollars during a 2014 indiegogo campaign didn't you i backed it you backed it i have the shirt you know
[998.62 --> 1002.62]  what hold on a second go get that shirt i'm gonna go get that shirt all right he's gone
[1004.30 --> 1008.06]  and it went on to collect about 70 million dollars in institutional venture capital
[1008.78 --> 1015.66]  who invests in this kind of thing you literally you did well i don't think no i mean i mean the venture
[1015.66 --> 1021.26]  okay i mean the venture capitalists are they that like do they just have nothing better to spend money
[1021.26 --> 1026.30]  i'm gonna go get the shirt after that it was 2012. do you know what we could do with 70 million dollars
[1026.30 --> 1029.66]  nobody has ever offered us 70 million dollars you can't even pass calculus
[1031.82 --> 1037.42]  but we could hire people we have more revenue than jibo boom i actually i actually don't know that they
[1037.42 --> 1042.30]  actually seem to have sold a fair number of these stupid things so and they're like 700 of these okay i
[1042.30 --> 1048.22]  don't actually know that they're more than that uh it was 2012 though so it's a little different because
[1048.22 --> 1055.26]  anyone can see today that was even less realistic you backed he's yelling saying like who backed it
[1055.26 --> 1063.10]  it was unrealistic but he backed it so obviously no one can hear you silence but the thing that you
[1063.10 --> 1070.46]  didn't know in 2012 was that there was going to be inexpensive fairly intelligent virtual assistants
[1070.46 --> 1077.18]  in every home like yes we did siri already existed linus is saying that siri already existed true
[1078.54 --> 1087.02]  true you we thought apple was stop no one can hear you stop yelling at me i can't i can't find that
[1087.02 --> 1092.94]  i'm not yelling at you i'm yelling i'm yelling to you you're yelling okay endlessly so here's so here's
[1092.94 --> 1100.54]  the thing we we didn't we we didn't know that like amazon was gonna win or anything like that but we
[1100.54 --> 1108.06]  knew that inexpensive digital assistants were coming because they already existed siri already existed
[1108.06 --> 1116.94]  what were the odds that this weird robot that doesn't move like like the demos made no sense like oh
[1116.94 --> 1124.70]  jibo will take a picture for you right i'm gonna go get this thing plug it in and position it why don't
[1124.70 --> 1133.26]  i just go get a camera at that point why there's just no reason for anything that it that it was in
[1133.26 --> 1139.90]  the it just made no sense i backed jibo because i knew that if it was ever delivered it was going to be
[1139.90 --> 1146.38]  a dumpster fire and i wanted to be the first one in on the action that's why i would say i would say you
[1146.38 --> 1152.38]  burnt your eyebrows right off um the thing that that sucked about jibo in the end though was that
[1152.38 --> 1159.66]  thing by the yeah i think there's a crux of it by the time it arrived it did have i think fantastic
[1160.38 --> 1164.86]  uh what do you call the animatronics the way that it moves the way that it dances was super life like
[1164.86 --> 1169.34]  it was like looking at a pixar character in front of you it's super awesome that's true and the way they
[1169.34 --> 1175.02]  did that with just the three four sections four segments of the body really it was really elegant and
[1175.02 --> 1180.94]  the thing that sucked was was the onboard computation the ai the yeah and by the time
[1180.94 --> 1187.42]  it arrived in 2017 that had been figured out by google and amazon and maybe even siri and a lesser
[1187.42 --> 1194.86]  degree apple if they had just plugged in like if it was just jibo operated by the google assistant yes
[1194.86 --> 1199.74]  it would be way better it still wouldn't have been enough at that price point it still would have had
[1199.74 --> 1205.18]  to have been three or four hundred dollars it would have had to be a decent music speaker at 399
[1205.82 --> 1212.22]  with like oh man what else would it have had to do an oled screen yeah because that really ruined it
[1212.22 --> 1217.10]  if you look at this can you put up that under the screen all the the pictures that you see are like
[1217.10 --> 1222.46]  that where it's like wow it's this pure black screen with just an eyeball that moves around it has all
[1222.46 --> 1227.58]  this emotion but when you actually had it in front of you you could see the lcd screen it was a it was like
[1227.58 --> 1234.14]  light gray instead of a black against the background and it made people thought that it was a big uh
[1234.14 --> 1238.78]  they thought that it looked like a big mouth they thought the square screen looked like a mouth and
[1238.78 --> 1244.38]  that its eyes were like yeah there the time the time picture you can see it so you can see see those
[1244.38 --> 1249.66]  circles at the top those are the cameras and people thought that those looked like eyes and that the
[1249.66 --> 1253.02]  big square was a giant mouth and it looked like that big i'm a charge my laser
[1253.02 --> 1259.74]  so oled screen necessary we actually talked to them about that at ces and they said that they
[1259.74 --> 1265.18]  just couldn't buy the oled screens um because they couldn't meet the minimum order quantities
[1265.18 --> 1269.18]  they had to buy such a volume of them and they weren't making enough gbos to justify it
[1269.98 --> 1274.62]  well it's a good thing they didn't uh push for that that minimum order quantity because they would
[1274.62 --> 1279.50]  have had a lot more gbos that they wouldn't know what to do with at that point i uh
[1279.50 --> 1285.34]  i tell you man the amount of venture capital money that just gets thrown at stuff that
[1285.34 --> 1291.98]  obviously isn't going to work yeah is is just mind-blowing to me because that money
[1292.62 --> 1300.46]  is just gone it's just gone it's not just gone it is just no no no no no a lot of it a lot of it
[1300.46 --> 1305.18]  was paid to the employees okay they worked on it since 2012 yeah yeah those people put it back into the
[1305.18 --> 1311.18]  economy all right all right okay it's not gone but like if you wanted to just contribute to putting
[1311.18 --> 1317.66]  money back in the economy why don't you just like donate to a homeless shelter or two like obviously
[1317.66 --> 1326.30]  there are better ways to just put money back into the economy than creating a weird plastic ai
[1326.94 --> 1334.62]  like landfill filler like well that is sad that imagine just making a mass mass market market product
[1334.62 --> 1339.42]  and all the environmental damage part of that and then they're just in a heap like like getting
[1339.42 --> 1345.90]  liquidated nobody cares yeah that's et for atari or whatever just like literally bury them yeah that's
[1345.90 --> 1351.02]  brutal one thing that i feel really weird about with this one is that i've never before felt such a
[1351.02 --> 1358.62]  visceral connection to free market capitalism like this thing failed for lots of good reasons but in a way
[1359.50 --> 1365.82]  we we definitely played a role in it failing because well they made it they made it suck it arrived at
[1365.82 --> 1370.14]  our desk we told the whole world that it sucked we weren't the only ones who said it but we're a very
[1370.14 --> 1375.98]  visible channel and so in our own small way we contributed to these people not having jobs anymore
[1375.98 --> 1381.90]  and that's kind of crazy i feel like part of me feels bad but then i'm just like well i'm just like cog in
[1381.90 --> 1387.90]  the wheel of evolution and and free market capitalism sink or swim you guys should have done a better job
[1387.90 --> 1394.22]  and i wouldn't have had to do this to you that's an interesting uh that's an interesting take on it
[1394.22 --> 1404.06]  you know it's funny i don't normally think of myself as having a um this is weird like playing a role yeah as
[1404.06 --> 1409.50]  as sort of playing a role and people not having a job anymore but uh that is an interesting take on it i just
[1409.50 --> 1416.46]  i guess i maybe i should feel bad because i'm sure there were very smart people very intelligent
[1416.46 --> 1424.30]  people who worked at jibo no question no question but like i look at it and i go this was so obvious
[1424.30 --> 1432.46]  to me that this wasn't going anywhere um like why didn't you get out like i feel bad because yes i guess
[1432.46 --> 1437.18]  we contributed to the downfall though to be clear in this case i don't feel that bad because i don't
[1437.18 --> 1444.38]  think we played that large of a role but like couldn't you tell you know well i mean a lot for
[1444.38 --> 1448.46]  a lot of people it's just the job like they know it's not going to be an awesome product but they're
[1448.46 --> 1454.94]  getting they're fleshing out their resume right but here's the thing like i quit my job when it was
[1454.94 --> 1462.14]  clear to me that the direction of the the trajectory of the company was not competitive and
[1462.14 --> 1469.90]  the thing is is that it's easy a lot of the time people say well it's easy for you to say you know
[1469.90 --> 1478.78]  you had an opportunity to go and do something else and it's like right but if the trajectory is bad and
[1478.78 --> 1487.74]  the foundational aspects of the business are bad which it should have been obvious to anybody who
[1487.74 --> 1495.34]  worked there but this company was not profitable and not hitting key milestones so investor money was
[1495.34 --> 1502.06]  gonna run out what do you think is gonna happen so when you can see that the foundation is rotten
[1502.78 --> 1511.34]  and the trajectory is bad why not go now well maybe because rather than later when everyone all your
[1511.34 --> 1515.26]  other colleagues are trying to find work too well because the part that you're working on might be good
[1515.26 --> 1520.86]  like the person who did the animatronics his resume is his or her resume is still awesome at the end of
[1520.86 --> 1525.02]  it they'll probably find a job there's and there's lots of things like i made all the apis that connected
[1525.02 --> 1530.14]  to iheart radio or whatever like when you compartmentalize that they maybe still are proud of the work
[1530.14 --> 1534.86]  but here's the thing like you had a pretty long runway here you could kind of wrap up your current
[1534.86 --> 1541.02]  project get the resumes out there you know like well it's a startup so maybe they had vested chairs like
[1541.02 --> 1544.70]  a lot of their pay structure could have been staying there okay yeah that could be true
[1545.98 --> 1550.54]  say okay that's something i didn't really consider like when i think about employee retention you know
[1550.54 --> 1557.10]  i really think about making sure that i maintain and making sure that everybody who works here knows
[1557.10 --> 1565.50]  that we are maintaining very strong like foundational strength for the business like linus media group is
[1565.50 --> 1572.78]  built upon rock not upon wood that is eaten what kind of rock carpenter limestone tall and it it's
[1572.78 --> 1578.06]  talk it's granite that's number one on the most hardness scale hardness scale it's granite you know
[1578.06 --> 1583.42]  the hardness scale yes i know most scale of hardness what's 10 then i don't is it diamond yeah
[1584.38 --> 1587.74]  what what what's the only thing i can cut a diamond though more diamond yeah
[1587.74 --> 1595.98]  yeah ow headphone users yeah grade three facts i don't even think that's grade three facts it's
[1595.98 --> 1599.58]  more like grade nine facts most hardness scale is grade eight but like the whole like what can
[1599.58 --> 1604.30]  cut a diamond that's young that's kid stuff okay all right all right all right all right all right
[1604.94 --> 1611.74]  anyway i just i feel bad but i also feel bad in the same way that like i feel bad for some of my
[1611.74 --> 1615.34]  colleagues who were left over at ncix like i feel bad this sucks but like
[1617.58 --> 1622.78]  some of them and this is this is the funniest thing about it sort of some of them i had conversations
[1622.78 --> 1632.86]  with like hey it's been another year you're still there what gives i'm like yeah you know it's good for
[1632.86 --> 1640.22]  me i'm like right but like this clearly isn't sustainable why are you still there
[1640.22 --> 1646.86]  yeah you know like it's i'd rather i'd rather be the rat that abandoned the ship
[1647.58 --> 1651.58]  than like the one that goes down with it personally and i think it sounded more like
[1651.58 --> 1654.94]  you were the rat that was like i'm gonna get into this container and get shipped off of the
[1654.94 --> 1659.26]  ship before it hits an iceberg and then all the other people still work they're like the rats
[1659.26 --> 1663.74]  scurrying away from the water in titanic you know when they're trapped at the bottom and
[1664.70 --> 1670.14]  those cages the irish people i am proud to say i have not watched that movie since it's theatrical
[1670.14 --> 1676.30]  release i do not remember hmm and you would have been wait 11 years old yeah
[1677.50 --> 1683.34]  what 94 was it 94 no it's 96. i was in the third grade i believe
[1685.18 --> 1692.78]  this is this is an important like event in your life like you remember titanic 97. 97 okay i'm guessing
[1692.78 --> 1698.86]  yeah yeah so i would have been 11 in 97 yeah 1997 okay all right i'm pretty good at that it's one of my
[1698.86 --> 1705.82]  like pet superpowers okay guessing dates uh years that i've lived through of things you got a good one
[1705.82 --> 1716.54]  for me here um no it's just bad superpower it's rarely useful and even when it's useful all i get is
[1716.54 --> 1722.38]  little brownie points for myself date guessing man exactly he's no fun at parties
[1725.26 --> 1733.34]  what year was 9 11 2001 okay so that's easy i know because that was like wait i'm so stupid i tried
[1733.34 --> 1737.42]  that was supposed to be a joke where the answer was built into the question no but none of those two
[1737.42 --> 1743.34]  numbers even have to do with the year yeah no that was like that was one of the most surreal moments of
[1743.34 --> 1751.98]  my life so living on the west coast um like everything that went down was very much in
[1751.98 --> 1759.18]  progress um when my my radio alarm like when you woke up when so my alarm clock was tuned into news
[1759.18 --> 1763.74]  radio because i found that that woke me up better than music someone like talking at me and the way
[1763.74 --> 1768.86]  they were talking at me that morning i thought i was still dreaming i was sure i was still dreaming i was
[1768.86 --> 1775.34]  like this is the weirdest street and holy now you said a swear word i've never said a swear word in my
[1775.34 --> 1783.58]  life um look in the in the 2018 yeah so so the so the so it was like going off next to me and i was just
[1783.58 --> 1789.50]  like i just kind of lied in bed i was like is this real like
[1791.74 --> 1797.90]  yeah yeah i'm awake um and like school all school all that day so like i remember my grade nine science
[1797.90 --> 1804.38]  teacher was just he didn't really even say they wheel the tv into your classroom um yeah he he
[1804.38 --> 1809.82]  didn't because the science class always had their own tv right so he uh so he didn't really say we
[1809.82 --> 1817.66]  weren't going to do class that day but he had the tv on and loud so that like he could hear and
[1819.02 --> 1824.70]  like we didn't have class that day yeah yeah it was it was it was bizarre anyway um we could do we
[1824.70 --> 1829.18]  could do another there's no way to nicely uh say we're out of that so let's just do sponsors yeah
[1829.18 --> 1839.58]  let's do our sponsors so um the first one we've got is um oh wait what the heck uh sorry so you are
[1839.58 --> 1850.94]  an invidious show uh the first one we've got is uh moss uh yes moss organizer so this is the moss grande
[1850.94 --> 1854.70]  previous generation you can hold that one oh that's exactly what it does and i will take the
[1854.70 --> 1863.34]  moss grande 2018 updated version i like the black one so this pack is expandable up to 40 liters and
[1863.34 --> 1869.50]  i'm just going to try and find the expandable zipper i'm sure it works similarly to mine but i can't find
[1869.50 --> 1877.02]  it right now ah it's this one so you can wait yes it's this one so you can expand it like that personally
[1877.02 --> 1881.74]  i would just don't really use that feature but whatever it's up to you if it's up to 17 inch
[1881.74 --> 1888.78]  laptops it's a 40 ounce water bottle no you you're the type of dude that always has a full backpack
[1888.78 --> 1896.54]  not anymore wow when i when i was riding my bike uh this summer to work i was just got so sick of
[1896.54 --> 1901.10]  carrying so much stuff on my back because it's really uncomfortable in a sport bike posture to carry
[1901.10 --> 1907.90]  a heavy backpack that i was like you know what i work hard i'm gonna treat myself to a second one
[1907.90 --> 1913.26]  of all the stupid tools that i keep in my backpack one for work and one for home so that's why i bought
[1913.26 --> 1919.26]  myself this other orange screwdriver i bought myself another pair of side cutters another pair of pliers
[1919.26 --> 1923.58]  another pair of jeweler screwdrivers like all those stupid things that i always keep in my bag so i'm
[1923.58 --> 1928.78]  actually down to i don't even think this is the same model is it the same model yeah i think it is the
[1928.78 --> 1933.82]  same model okay well whatever so this is my bag so the only things i have in it are my blade my mouse
[1933.82 --> 1942.14]  pad for my blade blade stealth um oh these phones that i've been meaning to return to work tyler uh in
[1942.14 --> 1949.18]  the tablet that's in the tablet pouch i've got my power bank i've got my sunglasses and the handy dandy um
[1949.18 --> 1957.18]  um sunglass like yeah the top one that's a sweet pouch yeah oh wow it is armored yeah i've got my
[1957.18 --> 1962.22]  mouse is that four sunglasses mouse down the ones yeah that's on the one side i've usually got my
[1962.22 --> 1967.82]  power ball on the other side but right now i have some aspirin because my knee hurts and it's inflamed um
[1968.94 --> 1975.18]  and then i've got my power adapter which is not supposed to be there i've got some there's a zipper here
[1975.18 --> 1980.54]  sorry you guys aren't really able to see this but i've got some usb some chapstick my uh angel bird
[1980.54 --> 1988.70]  portable ssd uh some business cards this was uh this was actually a nice like uh best man groomsman
[1988.70 --> 1994.54]  gift it's like uh got my name on it yeah they got divorced but oh they spelled your name wrong i still
[1994.54 --> 2004.94]  have no they did not i know for a fact isn't it s e b a s s t i a n sebastian anyway uh it is
[2004.94 --> 2010.62]  the new one has improved strap materials for greater comfort a stronger ripstop nylon lining
[2010.62 --> 2016.86]  improved power adapter mounting and cable management use and you can use offer code minus tech 25 to save
[2016.86 --> 2023.82]  10 over at moss organizer lol didn't have that up the whole time dot com until christmas
[2025.10 --> 2032.54]  organization it's truly a great gift for the ocd nerds in your life all right so we've also got
[2032.54 --> 2037.82]  see sonic as a sponsor today wow since when does see sonic sponsor the land show and they are featuring
[2038.38 --> 2047.10]  the um where'd it go it's the power supply that we had over here yeah there'd it go hold on is this
[2047.10 --> 2054.62]  it oh no sorry that's not uh do you have the power supply i have nothing oh wait a second
[2054.62 --> 2063.34]  do you have it is this it no that's not it uh okay well i guess i can't really i guess i can't really
[2063.34 --> 2071.10]  show it um so the see sonic prime ultra time oh i know what we're supposed to do i'm supposed to click
[2071.10 --> 2079.98]  this da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da there it is can we use cookies uh yes
[2079.98 --> 2086.54]  yes yes use your cookies yes you can have all the cookies the prime ultra titanium it's 80 plus
[2086.54 --> 2095.18]  titanium and it has a 12 year warranty which is ridiculous it's fully modular uh it's super quiet
[2095.18 --> 2100.94]  how many builds would you use over 12 years is that two three pcs that's like three to four for
[2100.94 --> 2105.90]  me anyway like every every three years i'd say it's pretty reasonable to refresh your computer maybe
[2105.90 --> 2110.78]  not the whole thing well exactly you're keeping the power supply like graphic yeah for sure there
[2110.78 --> 2117.26]  would be no reason to upgrade this power supply that i can think of for at least like i'm just
[2117.26 --> 2122.86]  trying to think like 10 years ago what was a top of the line power supply like it would still be
[2122.86 --> 2127.10]  usable today even if it's not still top of the line like i see no reason why this couldn't be the
[2127.10 --> 2133.02]  same thing so it's got a fluid dynamic fan uh fluid dynamic bearing fan it's got premium hybrid
[2133.02 --> 2137.98]  fan control so you can keep your fan noise minimal it's got micro tolerance load regulation whatever
[2137.98 --> 2143.10]  that means basically it means good regulation and lambda noise level a plus plus so that means the
[2143.10 --> 2150.22]  noise output stays below 20 decibels during operation pretty cool so check it out at seesonix website or

[2206.06 --> 2213.42]  from other sponsors of ours that are like who's that james guy what is he doing i haven't heard from
[2213.42 --> 2218.54]  fresh books i don't know they seem pretty chill someone came up to me at ltx and was like do fresh books
[2219.74 --> 2231.58]  really yeah all right a chinese scientist claims to have created the first designer babies um
[2232.46 --> 2240.14]  basically this was posted by captain to fire on the forum and um it's like
[2240.14 --> 2248.22]  kind of hard to cover this because the actual information is a little bit spotty so he claims
[2248.22 --> 2255.82]  that he's created two twin girls that are resistant to hiv virus through some kind of mutation that is
[2255.82 --> 2263.66]  more common in uh europe people of european ancestry who are survivors of like the bubonic plague or something
[2263.66 --> 2269.02]  like that like it has to do with some resistance that was built in europe but that wasn't built over in
[2269.02 --> 2277.26]  asia um now pretty much everyone is mad uh the university that he was currently on unpaid leave
[2277.26 --> 2285.18]  from uh the scientific community at large the tech community at large um and like the the university was
[2285.98 --> 2292.70]  unaware of the project and its nature and is calling on international experts to form an independent
[2292.70 --> 2299.58]  committee to probe the matter like people be mad um is there anything else to kind of say about this
[2299.58 --> 2305.02]  well we can talk about what actually sure allegedly happened so the best way to get acquainted i thought
[2305.02 --> 2310.38]  our good starting point is actually look at a youtube video that the doctor whose last name is he which is
[2310.38 --> 2317.42]  actually kind of uh confusing but he uploaded this video and he um gives his perspective on the whole
[2317.42 --> 2323.58]  thing he doesn't call them designer babies he thinks that this is totally ethical and moral and i think
[2323.58 --> 2329.26]  he makes a compelling case for that here um and he explains the process which is this is this is
[2329.26 --> 2336.46]  fertilization by ivf and so what they did was they inject the father's sperm into the mother's eggs and
[2336.46 --> 2342.22]  shortly after that they inject some proteins and they carry out the gene surgery uh using crispr technology
[2342.94 --> 2347.98]  which i understand if there's enzymes are programmed to look for particular patterns in dna and when
[2347.98 --> 2353.58]  they find them they just snip that out and only that so what they did was they they sequenced um
[2354.62 --> 2362.14]  and they did a whole genome sequencing on the i guess the cells on the on the babies before doing the
[2362.14 --> 2368.30]  genome surgery and after and the reason they did that is then they can compare to see if any genes were
[2368.30 --> 2374.46]  affected that weren't intended to be affected and uh according to this person's the doctor's statement
[2374.46 --> 2379.34]  um the scientist does say that they didn't they didn't alter anything that they didn't intend to
[2379.34 --> 2381.18]  alter so it was a success in that regard
[2383.66 --> 2389.10]  so if it's all true that um these children are alive now they've been born and they will be the the
[2389.10 --> 2392.70]  the first living people who have had their genes edited if it's true
[2395.50 --> 2401.66]  dang crazy so it's going to be an interesting uh it's going to be an interesting couple of decades
[2401.66 --> 2407.42]  where do you use i see you scrolling over to other topics but where do you sit on that i'm like oh wow
[2407.42 --> 2414.38]  that is a pretty big question isn't it um i think it's i am far more comfortable with cybernetic
[2414.38 --> 2420.30]  improvements to humans than i am with genetic improvements to humans i think we open ourselves
[2420.30 --> 2426.62]  up to a lot of potential uh problems i mean even this one already has problems like i believe west
[2426.62 --> 2434.38]  nile virus is uh more likely to infect these little girls oh that's hairy so you're you're gaining
[2434.38 --> 2439.82]  resistance to one disease but you're actually losing some of your resistance to another and of course
[2439.82 --> 2445.58]  they're not consenting to that and of course they are not consenting to that that's that's a whole
[2445.58 --> 2450.94]  that's a whole separate issue i'm sort of talking 10 000 foot view right now what does it mean to
[2450.94 --> 2458.46]  humanity now as long as it takes place on a relatively limited scale i i i doubt that we're
[2458.46 --> 2464.14]  opening ourselves up to mass extinction through having you know edited all of our own genes like of an
[2464.14 --> 2469.18]  entire if we edited an entire generation's genes and then all of a sudden something came along we made
[2469.18 --> 2475.34]  ourselves weak against it and piff humanity is dead um like i i feel like that kind of thing is very
[2475.34 --> 2485.26]  very unlikely um most of my discomfort like so right so in small doses i actually don't see it necessarily
[2485.26 --> 2492.06]  being a huge problem the issue is that yeah i broke it already the issue is that it opens itself up to
[2492.06 --> 2499.02]  all kinds of misuse and i don't have a ton of inherent trust for people okay there is nothing that i have
[2499.02 --> 2506.22]  seen in my life that would lead me to believe that people as a whole will take some kind of technology
[2506.22 --> 2514.86]  and use it only or even primarily for good are you if you take a step back and let's say everything was
[2514.86 --> 2521.82]  executed perfectly and maybe we're not even considering the fact that the alterations are inheritable by that
[2521.82 --> 2530.06]  by that organism's next of kin um if you just answer the question is it okay to to remove conditions
[2530.06 --> 2537.26]  that are just objectively harmful to to someone like take away take away the muddying of the fact
[2537.26 --> 2541.02]  that this may have increased their likelihood to contract a different disease so i have to ignore
[2541.02 --> 2548.62]  that we might not know what the hell we're doing yeah like let's just say in a vacuum it's like uh
[2549.26 --> 2554.30]  this procedure is guaranteed to only remove something harmful i guess your slippery slope
[2554.30 --> 2559.58]  arguments still remain it sure does that's the thing about a slippery slope is it starts really
[2559.58 --> 2563.58]  high up and you actually don't know that it was a problem until you're face down in the mud at the bottom
[2563.58 --> 2571.90]  so um yeah right so like i said i am far more comfortable with cybernetic upgrades than i am with
[2571.90 --> 2577.90]  actually making changes at a genetic level but does that apply even if those cybernetic upgrades are
[2577.90 --> 2584.62]  happening to an infant like the baby's born and you put an implant we already have that it's called a cochlear
[2584.62 --> 2592.54]  implant you can use it to restore hearing to an infant that was born profoundly deaf so we have that um
[2592.54 --> 2601.50]  um now the funny thing about that is you might think as a hearing person as someone who was who
[2601.50 --> 2607.98]  was born without what at least some people would describe as a disability you might think well this
[2607.98 --> 2615.02]  is so obvious if they couldn't hear and now they can hear then that's great cochlear implants for all
[2615.02 --> 2620.30]  but there are actually people out there who feel like they've kind of had their identity robbed from
[2620.30 --> 2626.14]  them because a cochlear implant does not make you hear as well as a hearing person in the installation
[2626.14 --> 2630.94]  of a cochlear implant they have to remove and this might be outdated knowledge but as far as i know
[2630.94 --> 2639.34]  they have to remove everything that was left of any uh hearing capability that you had before they
[2639.34 --> 2645.98]  perform the operation making you sort of not whole as a as a person depending on how you kind of define
[2645.98 --> 2652.38]  that and so they can end up feeling kind of robbed of a community because if they hadn't had it they
[2652.38 --> 2657.66]  would have been part of the deaf community versus if they just hadn't been born deaf then they would
[2657.66 --> 2663.50]  have been part of the hearing community but they're kind of in this weird limbo and you could make
[2663.50 --> 2669.50]  objective arguments all day for why their position is wrong but it doesn't ultimately matter because if we
[2669.50 --> 2678.70]  remove the emotional component of being human then why even bother wow i have a perfect emotional segue
[2678.70 --> 2683.50]  for that we've got a hundred dollar super chat over here we should read out oh really wow who does that
[2684.14 --> 2692.30]  uh thank you uh in advance um hey thanks for the everything during my job i hope you remember me
[2692.30 --> 2698.70]  shoe 125 probably not lol still never got float plane working ah thanks for the everything during my
[2698.70 --> 2705.82]  is this a person from the ncx for during my job i don't know or someone just watches ltt at work
[2705.82 --> 2714.54]  i don't know um jules asked how was the cake i actually didn't get any i did how was the cake very
[2714.54 --> 2721.34]  tall it was like how wide do i have to make this piece to get a regular like amount of cake here and
[2721.34 --> 2726.22]  i was like i'm just gonna go regular width and it's like was it yummy it was like an almond style cake
[2726.22 --> 2731.18]  right or something isn't that marzipan i don't know was it good yeah there's lots of custard in
[2731.18 --> 2735.82]  it which i'm all about lots of many layers it was like i had this tiger wait did i take a photo of
[2735.82 --> 2742.30]  this whatever it was good thanks for the cake uh makel says make a computer that is made from chip to
[2742.30 --> 2748.14]  chip transistor and resistors from scratch that equals something from 1995. i think alex is actually working
[2748.14 --> 2753.82]  on a diy cpu at the moment um by the way hi scott no it's like there's like a guide you can follow
[2753.82 --> 2758.70]  like he doesn't have to invent it or anything um so yeah we have rick from rick and morty working in
[2758.70 --> 2765.10]  oh yeah he's just over there making a flux capacitor defibrillator wait what space time
[2765.74 --> 2770.06]  space time defibrillator when you're time traveling and someone's under cardiac arrest
[2770.06 --> 2777.42]  all right one more topic the most important one of this week that's what you're picking
[2778.30 --> 2784.94]  starbucks starbucks says it's gonna block porn on its public wi-fi next year so if you want it
[2784.94 --> 2790.54]  if you want to jerk it in starbucks you're gonna have to do it sometime between now and december 31st
[2790.54 --> 2794.86]  hey you don't have to i vote for christmas day because it'll probably be pretty empty
[2794.86 --> 2801.90]  um yeah there's not really much else to say about that there's a little bit actually so there was
[2802.46 --> 2805.90]  they're late to the party there's some people who are actually kind of mad because starbucks took
[2806.78 --> 2810.22]  up to two years longer than other chains like subway and chick-fil-a and mcdonald's who have
[2810.22 --> 2816.78]  already implemented this and there's actually a um a petition that circulated that got 26 000 signatures
[2817.82 --> 2823.02]  um that was circulated by an organization who fights with these this kind of stuff and they they
[2823.02 --> 2826.94]  have some pretty compelling arguments of why this should happen sooner so they say that it helps
[2827.82 --> 2834.06]  teens and underage people um like when when they don't have these filters at starbucks these kids
[2834.06 --> 2838.78]  can go to these public wi-fi places and and watch stuff that they otherwise couldn't watch at home under
[2839.90 --> 2846.86]  home wi-fi and that also applies to sex offenders who by law can't visit certain sites right but
[2846.86 --> 2854.22]  apparently they can when they go to these public spaces so actually there is one more topic youtube
[2854.22 --> 2861.42]  is bringing down the paywall on their youtube originals apparently um they have determined that
[2861.42 --> 2867.18]  the ad supported model that has sustained youtube basically since its uh acquisition from by google anyway
[2867.98 --> 2874.30]  is the way to go so youtube originals are still getting funded but they will become free and ad
[2874.30 --> 2878.94]  supported rather than only being available to youtube premium members personally i think this is a good
[2878.94 --> 2885.18]  move um i mean for for my part anyway youtube premium is already a compelling enough value ad
[2885.98 --> 2891.34]  or a compelling enough value just based on that i don't have to watch ads like and i don't even watch
[2891.34 --> 2896.78]  much youtube like half the time i'm blocking the ad on my own video with my premium stupid premium
[2896.78 --> 2901.66]  membership uh the fact that like youtube our google play music is included like it's already a great value i
[2901.66 --> 2908.78]  i don't really understand why we need these originals uh like original series um but what this will
[2908.78 --> 2913.82]  probably mean is that youtube is going to be cutting back the kind of funding that they had put aside for
[2913.82 --> 2917.90]  youtube originals like it seems to me that they've just done some re-kid jiggering of the map on the
[2917.90 --> 2924.54]  back end for how this youtube premium money is getting distributed and they've gone well we're spending a lot
[2924.54 --> 2928.30]  on these originals but they don't seem to be actually driving subscriptions so what if we just kind of
[2928.30 --> 2933.66]  cut that entire part of the equation and like we can still do youtube originals and that's like cool
[2933.66 --> 2937.42]  but let's just make it accessible to everyone and then maybe it'll get a lot more views and then
[2937.42 --> 2941.18]  like maybe people will care more about it and we can go like mainstream with this whole thing and then
[2941.18 --> 2945.98]  there's like merch and licensing and like other platforms that we can license it to and like they
[2945.98 --> 2951.90]  could take a more conventional approach to uh to high production value content and that's that's right
[2951.90 --> 2956.62]  because even though it was a ton of money hundreds of millions of dollars that's still a drop in the
[2956.62 --> 2962.62]  bucket compared to the tens of billions that other services like netflix and amazon prime and hulu are
[2962.62 --> 2969.10]  spending so and no offense to ourselves and other youtubers but like quite frankly i would i would pick
[2969.74 --> 2977.18]  you know the actual experienced hollywood production people that netflix works with over like youtubers
[2977.18 --> 2983.18]  for these kinds of well the thing is you lose the spirit of what you like about the youtuber like i love
[2983.18 --> 2988.86]  vsauce i didn't michael if you're watching i didn't really care for the mind frame that i watched and
[2988.86 --> 2994.22]  the reason even though the concepts are cool is because it's no longer vsauce because the cool thing
[2994.22 --> 2999.66]  you like about vsauce is michael's cool entrance and like it's just one camera and he sets it up in a
[2999.66 --> 3003.58]  weird location in his house in a weird way and then suddenly i just feel like i'm watching discovery
[3003.58 --> 3008.54]  channel or something with these epic sweeps all booms and it's like it doesn't have the same character
[3008.54 --> 3015.02]  yeah yeah so this is gonna start uh it's actually starting in 2019 but it won't fully affect all
[3015.02 --> 3020.06]  originals until 2020. there's probably some contract stuff going on there so some of the originals will
[3020.06 --> 3025.18]  be free to watch with ads soon and others you'll have to wait a little while speaking of things that
[3025.18 --> 3031.42]  you'll have to wait a little while for the wan show you're you're fixed next week because we are
[3031.42 --> 3037.98]  done for the day it's uh wow it is 20 after 6 we are super done for the day we will see you again next
[3037.98 --> 3040.46]  week same bat time same bat channel bye
[3046.70 --> 3048.78]  one chat's like hey it's vsauce michael here
[3050.14 --> 3052.86]  i would i did get to meet some of his support
[3052.86 --> 3053.26]  stuff
[3053.26 --> 3055.34]  oh that's i was honest
[3057.66 --> 3059.50]  were they like oh wow that's so cool
[3059.50 --> 3060.30]  you look for my head
[3061.74 --> 3065.26]  nope they were like who no i don't even know if they have anything
[3065.26 --> 3072.06]  you like
[3072.06 --> 3074.06]  you
[3074.06 --> 3076.06]  you
[3076.06 --> 3078.06]  you
[3078.06 --> 3080.06]  you
[3080.06 --> 3082.06]  you
[3082.06 --> 3084.06]  you
