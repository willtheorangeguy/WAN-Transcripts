[0.00 --> 7.24]  Are you sure? We are live! Now I remember the thing you were gonna fix, the recording light.
[8.78 --> 13.28]  That's what it was. We don't have one, but that's okay. Guys, we've got a great show for you today.
[13.90 --> 21.34]  We actually, oh man, we made some crazy, crazy pants videos this week. And by we, I mean me and
[21.34 --> 28.04]  other people, not you. Wow. It is what it is, dude. It is what it is. But you guys did something
[28.04 --> 35.86]  important this week, too. That's right. Yeah. So, yeah, it's apparently didn't excite people
[35.86 --> 43.38]  who were reading the WAN show title last week. You know, it's an elite few, okay? It was one of the
[43.38 --> 50.02]  lowest viewed WAN shows in the last year. The people that care, care a lot. And I love you for it.
[50.02 --> 57.84]  But, uh, Floatplane went alpha. Oh. Uh. Can I have an HDMI cable?
[57.84 --> 64.52]  Also, you don't want to show that, dude. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, no, I don't. I don't want to show that. I super don't want to show that. I'm gonna put, oh, you know what I'm gonna put?
[64.96 --> 70.84]  Don't put anything. Just log in. I'm gonna put Minesweeper. Minesweeper doesn't come on Windows 10, does it?
[70.84 --> 83.40]  No, it doesn't. That is so stupid. Uh, the Windows team at Microsoft hates fun. Why? What is wrong with them? I hate that so much.
[83.40 --> 97.16]  You gotta go to the Xbox team for that. All right, anyway. Oh. Uh-oh. Uh. Well, we are off to a super WAN showy start to the show today there, folks.
[97.16 --> 104.08]  Uh, let's go ahead. Wait. This is the wrong one, man. That's the wrong one. Why is it called test? Why is it called test?
[105.08 --> 114.58]  Is it that? Oh. Okay, let's get us out of the way here. Click that, right? Yeah, yeah, rock on. Okay, so check this out.
[114.72 --> 119.30]  So I'm on my home, which the only way to navigate to home right now is to click this, which is not super intuitive.
[119.40 --> 125.36]  We'll get that sorted out. Don't worry. That's how most websites work. That's fine. The mobile one is a little weird.
[125.36 --> 132.50]  The desktop, that's completely fine. That's fine. I would probably, I would say that should probably be like a more kind of different kind of home.
[132.66 --> 137.00]  That is fine. Maybe like actual like float plane home where you browse creators and stuff.
[137.16 --> 143.40]  That is fine. Whereas like, there should be like a, like an all or something. Well, we'll figure, you know what? He and I are going to work this out.
[143.40 --> 150.66]  But basically you can see videos from creators that you follow or you could go to the important ones.
[151.26 --> 152.96]  Wow. Take that, Kyle.
[154.40 --> 160.58]  And you can see what's, what's gone up in the last week or so. So this is it. Like this is actually the site.
[160.92 --> 164.80]  You can subscribe using credit card. It's a little woohoo, but you can.
[164.80 --> 169.90]  Okay. It's not like woohoo in the sense that like the, the credit card data is being handled in a way that it's not acceptable.
[169.90 --> 170.84]  Yeah, it's being handled by Stripe.
[170.94 --> 175.40]  Yeah. Like it's just Stripe. It's just like the, the site itself around it.
[176.96 --> 178.02]  It's alpha. Okay.
[178.36 --> 179.48]  It works. It's working.
[179.58 --> 184.74]  But check this out. You can see the videos that we have up on float plane that are not yet on YouTube.
[185.06 --> 186.92]  So I think most of these are already up.
[187.12 --> 192.72]  And just so you guys know, if you have a forum account, actually regardless of if you have a subscription or not,
[192.72 --> 196.48]  but if you have a forum account that has a full plane subscription or a bit with ultra subscription,
[196.48 --> 199.70]  you can go to full plane.com connect the account by,
[199.82 --> 203.24]  we're not going to show you because we'll ask this is going to auto fill some information.
[203.24 --> 207.70]  But if you go to the homepage, there's a more sign in options, drop down, buttony thingy majiggy.
[207.82 --> 211.20]  Click on that. Click and sign in with the LTT forum, connect to your account,
[211.20 --> 215.08]  and then you'll have access to whatever subscriptions you currently have. Oh, smart.
[216.38 --> 217.24]  Way to go.
[217.72 --> 222.58]  Cause you have add ons disabled cause you can enable add ons in incognito if you want it.
[222.58 --> 226.12]  But yeah, click the sign in with LTT forum option. The other ones don't work right now.
[226.18 --> 230.56]  Don't worry about it. Click, click on the sign in with LTT forum option.
[231.10 --> 233.14]  Connect to your account and you'll have access, which is great.
[233.24 --> 236.82]  So there's a couple, at least a couple of videos on there that are pretty freaking cool.
[236.90 --> 241.08]  This is really cool. We've got three VR headsets running off of a single motherboard,
[241.64 --> 245.58]  single tower using virtualization.
[246.32 --> 249.42]  We did the top five most insane cases. Yes, that is a case.
[249.42 --> 252.78]  That is a real case. You can buy it if you're baller enough.
[253.92 --> 257.50]  These are the feedback on these videos is really good.
[257.68 --> 262.52]  And you can actually see the aforementioned feedback on the float plane website.
[262.70 --> 267.20]  Check that out. No way. Oh, hold on. I don't know if audio is on. Sorry guys.
[267.20 --> 271.38]  No way. Comments. Oh, okay. We should probably fix that.
[271.76 --> 275.24]  Jumped back up to the video. Yeah. Oh, no, maybe that.
[275.46 --> 279.10]  Okay. I don't know what happened there. But anyway, check this out. Comments, comments.
[280.42 --> 284.78]  Hey, hey, hey. Dig Dug at all. This is my first visit here.
[284.90 --> 288.08]  So these are my initial impressions. Look and feel the site is spot on.
[288.20 --> 288.56]  Heck yeah.
[288.56 --> 291.12]  Very professional looking. There's teething problems.
[291.22 --> 291.58]  There is.
[291.74 --> 294.10]  Like needing to log out and then in again after subscribing.
[294.44 --> 295.22]  Okay. Yep.
[295.58 --> 296.64]  Were you even aware of that one yet?
[296.64 --> 297.24]  Yeah, I think so.
[297.24 --> 301.12]  Okay. Video buffering is an issue. I'm stuck as low as 480p.
[301.30 --> 304.84]  Oh, okay. Now that's weird because we've actually been done pretty well there.
[307.02 --> 307.38]  Cool.
[307.56 --> 313.02]  Obviously, it might be a location thing. There's still some like easing in that needs to happen there.
[313.08 --> 317.34]  Yep. Should I do it? Switch to 1080p? See how well it goes?
[317.34 --> 323.50]  There has been some minor problems with that and we've been doing some re-kajiggering.
[323.56 --> 324.10]  Cool. Okay.
[324.10 --> 326.00]  With that. So that might be causing an issue right now.
[326.00 --> 331.62]  Ah, right. Because I think we're trying to change it so that it remembers your last, what you last selected.
[332.36 --> 335.84]  Properly without jumping to 360 first and then jumping back up.
[335.84 --> 336.76]  And then jumping back up.
[336.76 --> 340.50]  And usually if you like pause it and then do it again, it works because alpha, whatever.
[340.78 --> 343.14]  We're actually also having some issues with our connection here.
[344.10 --> 344.66]  At the office.
[344.66 --> 347.84]  Oh, of course. The second I switch, it's like playing fine.
[347.84 --> 347.88]  So it's working?
[348.20 --> 348.40]  Yeah.
[348.46 --> 349.26]  It's the typical, right?
[349.76 --> 350.06]  Correct.
[350.08 --> 351.14]  Yeah, now it's buffering.
[351.44 --> 353.84]  I suspect that's actually not float plane.
[354.28 --> 359.18]  Although it could be at this point because things are in a pretty delicate state right now.
[359.30 --> 362.00]  But anyway, the alpha's up.
[362.94 --> 365.06]  The NCIX bankruptcy videos are pretty dope.
[365.06 --> 368.78]  It works every other time we've shown it on WAN show and it will work again.
[369.16 --> 369.36]  Yep.
[370.44 --> 371.08]  Do not worry.
[371.84 --> 373.50]  What have we got for topics this week?
[373.60 --> 374.24]  Like, did anything?
[374.36 --> 374.72]  Oh, right.
[374.80 --> 375.82]  Yeah, no, things did happen.
[375.92 --> 376.22]  No, no, no.
[376.24 --> 377.68]  The Samsung Galaxy S9 happened.
[377.88 --> 378.74]  Nope, nothing happened.
[378.78 --> 379.34]  That happened.
[380.14 --> 381.16]  What else do we have?
[381.24 --> 386.02]  The Ryzen 7 2700X is rumored to maybe be happening at some point.
[386.02 --> 390.16]  Okay, I think this is sort of a big deal.
[390.26 --> 392.06]  This is back to the Samsung Galaxy S9.
[392.56 --> 397.88]  Word on the street is that Samsung might be nerfing the Exynos version of the phone.
[398.06 --> 398.32]  Oh.
[398.46 --> 401.72]  So that it's not too much better than the Snapdragon 845 version.
[402.94 --> 403.42]  That's...
[403.42 --> 404.76]  So as to upset their customers.
[405.24 --> 405.68]  Okay.
[405.84 --> 407.02]  So that's pretty interesting.
[407.98 --> 410.16]  You know, that actually kind of makes sense.
[410.54 --> 411.14]  Celebrate...
[411.14 --> 411.66]  Oh, go ahead.
[411.78 --> 413.10]  It's dumb, but it makes sense.
[413.10 --> 414.32]  Celebrate is advertising.
[414.44 --> 417.40]  They can now break the security of iOS 11, including the iPhone 10.
[417.64 --> 419.88]  And what else happened this week?
[420.28 --> 421.22]  Our intro worked.
[422.00 --> 422.28]  Bam.
[422.28 --> 422.96]  Oh, wow.
[422.96 --> 443.96]  Brought to you by Medria's Coffee.
[445.48 --> 447.18]  Brought to you by Synergy 2.
[448.18 --> 449.30]  And brought to you by...
[449.30 --> 450.70]  Honey.
[450.70 --> 458.96]  I mean, anything sounds kind of weird when you say it like that, but honey sounds especially
[458.96 --> 459.32]  weird.
[459.54 --> 459.64]  Honey.
[459.64 --> 459.92]  Honey.
[461.84 --> 463.92]  Apparently the sound is super quiet on the intro.
[464.14 --> 464.48]  You know what?
[464.54 --> 464.72]  Whatever.
[464.86 --> 465.12]  Nice.
[465.28 --> 465.38]  No, that's good.
[465.38 --> 466.80]  Someone says they needed that for bingo.
[467.44 --> 469.16]  So, you know...
[469.16 --> 469.76]  Needed what?
[469.92 --> 471.80]  Your loss is someone else's gain.
[471.88 --> 472.82]  I think it's screwed up intro.
[473.08 --> 473.46]  Nice.
[473.60 --> 473.88]  All right.
[473.96 --> 474.80]  I don't know, man.
[474.96 --> 475.80]  I don't know, man.
[476.88 --> 477.40]  All right.
[477.40 --> 479.72]  Let's jump right into our first topic here.
[480.06 --> 481.60]  How would that be for...
[481.60 --> 486.06]  Someone's going to lose their bingo if we start talking about tech any sooner than like 20
[486.06 --> 486.62]  minutes into...
[486.62 --> 487.78]  You know, it wouldn't surprise me.
[488.20 --> 492.12]  There's a lot of stuff that happens on this show a lot that probably shouldn't happen on
[492.12 --> 493.00]  this show quite so much.
[493.02 --> 495.72]  You know, the creator of Wancho Bingo tweeted me.
[495.88 --> 497.16]  I felt pretty special.
[497.22 --> 497.46]  Yeah.
[497.54 --> 497.76]  Yeah.
[497.84 --> 498.28]  That's good.
[498.38 --> 498.84]  That's good.
[498.84 --> 505.12]  So, this was posted by Edward the Weeb on the forum.
[505.88 --> 506.86]  Thanks for that, Edward.
[507.10 --> 509.06]  There's the unnecessarily loud laugh tile.
[509.06 --> 514.92]  The original article is from WCCF Tech.
[515.28 --> 527.98]  AMD's second generation Ryzen 7 2700X, rumored to be 8 core, 16 thread, 3.7 gigahertz base,
[528.12 --> 531.06]  up to 4.2 gigahertz boost with XFR.
[531.06 --> 542.74]  So, what this tells us is that second generation Ryzen is looking like a pretty small sort of tweak,
[542.92 --> 544.52]  you know, ironing out a couple wrinkles.
[544.82 --> 550.36]  You know, don't expect all of a sudden to be getting, you know, 48 core versions that are
[550.36 --> 552.30]  clocked at 5 gigahertz or anything like that.
[552.40 --> 553.86]  Evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
[554.68 --> 557.82]  But, let's see.
[557.98 --> 559.32]  16 megs, level 3 cache.
[559.88 --> 560.56]  4 megs, level 2.
[560.56 --> 563.16]  It might bring price drops to the previous gen.
[563.84 --> 565.48]  That might even be more interesting than anything.
[565.62 --> 568.78]  I'd be surprised if it does, to be perfectly honest with you.
[568.78 --> 571.28]  Is this going to be priced above then, or do you think they're just going to...
[571.28 --> 574.46]  I think they're going to slot these in above the existing ones.
[574.52 --> 576.82]  Here you can see the spec sheet comparison.
[577.54 --> 579.28]  So, there's the 1700X.
[579.34 --> 581.16]  Here's the replacement 2700X.
[581.16 --> 586.84]  So, we're going down to 12 nanometer, which gets us anywhere from 200 to 300 megahertz,
[586.84 --> 591.32]  higher clock speeds, at the same TDP.
[592.32 --> 593.12]  One year later.
[594.24 --> 596.18]  So, I mean...
[596.18 --> 596.80]  Okay.
[596.80 --> 596.94]  Okay.
[597.22 --> 599.60]  I can see some people being disappointed.
[600.44 --> 603.68]  Because Ryzen was like...
[603.68 --> 605.46]  I forget what AMD was quoting.
[605.60 --> 612.06]  It was like 40% or like 60% better than their previous generation.
[612.06 --> 613.18]  But that's not fair.
[613.28 --> 619.60]  That was because AMD actually hadn't really done a whole lot in the last four to five years
[619.60 --> 620.44]  leading up to it.
[620.44 --> 627.80]  And so, as much as it's easy to harp on Intel for these incremental generational improvements
[627.80 --> 637.06]  in CPU performance, now we're seeing that when all AMD has to work with is a very small
[637.06 --> 645.08]  manufacturing process shrink, it's really hard to do those generational leaps in performance
[645.08 --> 647.62]  the way that they did way back in the day.
[647.72 --> 651.18]  Like when AMD went from the Barton core to...
[651.18 --> 652.24]  What's Ledgehammer?
[652.40 --> 653.96]  Quahammer, I think, were the first...
[653.96 --> 655.66]  Were those the first ETHLON 64s?
[655.84 --> 657.62]  Within minutes of announcing.
[658.38 --> 658.94]  Oh, okay.
[659.02 --> 659.48]  Well, that's fun.
[660.74 --> 664.94]  And like when Intel went from the Netburst family up to Conroe.
[665.68 --> 668.54]  So, that doesn't really happen that often anymore.
[669.18 --> 673.80]  And it's funny, now that I think about it, when Intel did it way back when,
[673.80 --> 679.08]  that was because they had been not necessarily sitting on ass for a few years,
[679.20 --> 683.04]  but they had been barking up the wrong tree for a few years.
[683.04 --> 683.82]  That's for sure.
[684.06 --> 684.18]  Yeah.
[684.54 --> 686.22]  So, hmm.
[686.36 --> 689.96]  I wonder how long it has been since we've seen like a massive improvement.
[690.14 --> 691.62]  Like where could we find the last one?
[691.68 --> 693.40]  Maybe it would be Athlon 64.
[694.56 --> 695.68]  On AMD's side?
[695.76 --> 695.90]  Yeah.
[695.90 --> 696.54]  Or you mean in general?
[696.88 --> 698.08]  Yeah, no, just in general.
[698.08 --> 701.50]  The last time we saw a really big generational improvement.
[701.50 --> 707.50]  With that said, Conroe to Intel's integrated memory controller was a pretty big leap too
[707.50 --> 710.54]  because we went, no, because they introduced quad core first.
[711.42 --> 712.10]  Hard to say.
[712.36 --> 715.10]  In terms of, I know it wasn't in a lot of different ways,
[715.34 --> 720.18]  but in terms of like customer understanding and usability,
[720.62 --> 724.80]  which is a weird thing largely due to naming, but Sandy Bridge?
[725.24 --> 726.00]  You think so?
[726.00 --> 728.06]  I think a lot of people kind of got it more.
[729.48 --> 729.80]  Okay.
[730.00 --> 730.92]  So, you know what?
[730.96 --> 731.96]  I'm going to pick my moment.
[732.40 --> 740.62]  For me, the biggest CPU improvement in performance was not actually Barton to Clawhammer.
[741.02 --> 744.00]  For me, the biggest difference I saw was from...
[744.58 --> 747.66]  Yeah, again, my point is not just performance stuff.
[747.66 --> 751.50]  Like, I felt like the community, like paying attention to forums and stuff like that,
[751.56 --> 754.94]  I felt like people understood more with that one
[754.94 --> 758.52]  because the product naming scheme, I think, made more sense for a lot of people.
[758.52 --> 763.06]  So, I think it was Winchester was the last single core.
[763.80 --> 765.18]  No, Venice might have been.
[765.58 --> 766.18]  San Diego?
[766.42 --> 767.02]  Oh, crap.
[767.10 --> 767.84]  Which one was it?
[768.82 --> 770.60]  Athlon 64 models.
[773.00 --> 774.32]  Apparently something wrong with the camera.
[774.70 --> 776.14]  Something wrong with me.
[776.14 --> 777.14]  Hello.
[777.46 --> 777.88]  Yep, okay.
[779.26 --> 780.34]  The camera's tilted?
[780.60 --> 780.74]  What?
[783.28 --> 783.92]  Yeah, okay.
[784.10 --> 784.46]  So, I...
[784.46 --> 785.12]  Oh, no, no.
[785.20 --> 786.38]  It's not centered.
[787.32 --> 788.46]  Yeah, the thing is...
[788.46 --> 788.96]  Yeah, whatever.
[789.18 --> 789.84]  It doesn't matter.
[790.12 --> 790.16]  Yeah.
[790.22 --> 791.04]  Yeah, I'm over it.
[792.10 --> 796.94]  Also, there's some moiré in your sweater if we want to get really upset about little
[796.94 --> 798.70]  things that we don't worry about on the LAN show.
[798.70 --> 805.16]  So, for me, the big one was going from single core Athlon 64 to, I think it was the Toledo
[805.16 --> 809.56]  core, going to dual core Athlon 64 because that was...
[809.56 --> 811.32]  It wasn't a big improvement for gaming.
[811.76 --> 812.70]  Because back then...
[812.70 --> 812.72]  People are really upset.
[812.72 --> 813.26]  The camera's tilted.
[813.48 --> 813.88]  What are they?
[814.58 --> 814.94]  Sorry.
[815.04 --> 815.54]  Just keep going.
[815.66 --> 816.02]  I'll be back.
[816.10 --> 816.96]  I think I can see you.
[816.96 --> 820.50]  I can't do it myself.
[820.68 --> 820.98]  I'll be kidding.
[821.56 --> 821.96]  Okay.
[823.10 --> 824.12]  Oh, Max is here.
[824.26 --> 825.64]  Max is coming to save us.
[826.34 --> 828.42]  Because it wasn't a big improvement for gaming.
[828.52 --> 834.78]  You've got to remember that games did not benefit from dual core CPUs back in those days.
[835.36 --> 839.78]  But what it was was a huge improvement to the gaming experience if you had things running
[839.78 --> 840.36]  in the background.
[840.80 --> 845.64]  And it was a huge improvement to really the experience of doing anything at the same time.
[845.70 --> 846.70]  That was when multitasking...
[846.70 --> 847.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[847.42 --> 848.48]  ...really happened for me.
[849.62 --> 853.22]  And that's a really big deal, especially in terms of user experience.
[853.32 --> 853.48]  Yeah.
[853.94 --> 854.14]  Yeah.
[854.58 --> 855.22]  And it's like...
[855.22 --> 855.98]  It's the same way...
[855.98 --> 860.54]  And you know, the funny thing is, I remember arguing on forums about dual core back in the
[860.54 --> 869.10]  day because people who didn't see the bigger picture, who just saw the benchmarks on whatever
[869.10 --> 873.54]  the site they preferred was and saw that in all their favorite games, it didn't make a difference,
[873.54 --> 878.92]  those people would come out and say, you're paying literally twice as much for literally
[878.92 --> 881.90]  twice as many CPU cores and it doesn't make any difference.
[882.82 --> 888.44]  And it's the same argument that I would have with people when SSDs were first starting to
[888.44 --> 889.10]  gain popularity.
[889.64 --> 894.76]  Where they'd go, well, the benchmarks don't indicate a significant difference in performance
[894.76 --> 899.82]  other than boot time and they're very low capacity.
[899.82 --> 900.90]  But it feels amazing.
[901.02 --> 902.64]  But it feels really different.
[902.86 --> 902.88]  Yeah.
[902.88 --> 903.92]  And that's what it was like then.
[904.02 --> 904.18]  Yeah.
[904.18 --> 910.14]  And honestly, since the first good SSDs, so like back when Intel launched the X25M, I
[910.14 --> 912.36]  haven't really had that experience again.
[913.10 --> 914.10]  What was the first...
[914.10 --> 916.28]  I'm not going to Google, I'll just ask you, you probably know.
[916.32 --> 920.28]  What was the first generation that Intel introduced K for their unlockable SKUs?
[920.92 --> 922.26]  I believe it was the 2600K.
[922.40 --> 922.58]  Yeah.
[922.92 --> 923.10]  Yeah.
[923.10 --> 924.32]  So this is kind of what I'm talking about.
[924.32 --> 926.12]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[926.16 --> 927.26]  There was an 875K.
[927.98 --> 928.40]  Was there?
[928.40 --> 928.60]  Yes.
[929.04 --> 933.40]  And back then, so the 875K was...
[934.02 --> 935.28]  Crap.
[935.30 --> 935.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[936.72 --> 937.16]  Linfield?
[937.24 --> 937.72]  Linfield, yeah.
[937.72 --> 938.36]  Linfield, yeah.
[938.36 --> 938.78]  Linfield.
[939.00 --> 943.96]  So Linfield was architecturally the same as Bloomfield, which was the high-end socket
[943.96 --> 945.38]  1366 platform.
[946.62 --> 950.00]  I think it would be fair to say that Sandy Bridge popularized that, though.
[950.56 --> 950.96]  Yeah?
[951.28 --> 952.94]  So that was a big difference for you?
[953.10 --> 953.74]  I think so.
[954.18 --> 954.62]  Interesting.
[954.68 --> 958.38]  I found on forums and discussing with my friends and all this kind of stuff, people
[958.38 --> 962.16]  understood it a lot more when Sandy Bridge came around, and they changed the number
[962.16 --> 962.88]  schemes of things.
[963.00 --> 963.02]  Interesting.
[963.02 --> 966.48]  It was easier to understand, like, i5, i7.
[966.92 --> 967.36]  Really?
[968.18 --> 972.34]  2600K, 2500K, K, non-K, all of that kind of stuff.
[972.34 --> 972.70]  We're taking this to a straw poll.
[972.80 --> 975.14]  We're taking this to a straw poll because I want to know...
[975.14 --> 976.46]  It could be my little bubble.
[976.64 --> 977.14]  I don't know.
[977.20 --> 978.00]  I want to know.
[978.76 --> 979.04]  Okay.
[979.46 --> 983.08]  So there's a couple of angles to this, but I'll get into it.
[983.86 --> 984.08]  Okay.
[984.66 --> 986.00]  Core iX.
[986.00 --> 990.90]  More or less confusing than before.
[991.02 --> 996.54]  And to be clear, if you want to understand the entire stack, it might even be slightly
[996.54 --> 997.24]  more confusing.
[997.66 --> 1000.64]  But if you're like, is this one better or worse?
[1001.30 --> 1001.70]  Brr.
[1002.20 --> 1003.82]  It's kind of easy.
[1003.88 --> 1004.28]  Okay, guys.
[1004.32 --> 1005.00]  Hit that straw poll.
[1005.08 --> 1006.08]  I've got that in the Twitch chat.
[1006.12 --> 1006.68]  Hit the straw poll.
[1006.78 --> 1007.10]  So, okay.
[1007.28 --> 1008.44]  So here's the problem.
[1008.44 --> 1016.90]  Within a generation and within a product family, remembering that laptop product family is not
[1016.90 --> 1023.76]  the same as desktop product family and not the same as enterprise product family, then
[1023.76 --> 1031.14]  I can see Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 being simpler to understand.
[1031.96 --> 1035.04]  However, from generation to generation, I would argue...
[1035.04 --> 1035.90]  Oh, and it got way worse.
[1036.00 --> 1039.16]  I'm just saying with that generation, I brought people into understanding.
[1039.52 --> 1039.72]  Yeah.
[1039.76 --> 1042.36]  And I feel like a lot of people held on after that.
[1042.62 --> 1043.88]  But yes, it got messy.
[1044.08 --> 1044.98]  It was really confusing.
[1045.38 --> 1051.24]  I mean, nowadays, you'll see posts on Craigslist where people are just saying Core i7 PC.
[1052.14 --> 1052.42]  Yeah.
[1052.42 --> 1053.84]  You know, $300 or whatever.
[1053.94 --> 1054.22]  That's terrible.
[1054.22 --> 1054.90]  You just kind of go...
[1054.90 --> 1055.88]  But we're way beyond.
[1056.02 --> 1057.86]  We're not in Sandy Bridge generation anymore.
[1057.94 --> 1058.28]  Okay.
[1059.24 --> 1059.72]  Okay.
[1059.94 --> 1060.38]  All right.
[1060.40 --> 1063.62]  And now I think understanding has gone up as a whole.
[1064.10 --> 1066.60]  So you see that and you go, I know that's BS.
[1067.06 --> 1068.30]  And then you look into it.
[1068.52 --> 1069.50]  I think the understand...
[1069.50 --> 1070.38]  And I know people are...
[1070.38 --> 1071.02]  Wow!
[1071.46 --> 1073.16]  This is like 50-50.
[1073.86 --> 1078.38]  I don't remember the last time I saw our community this evenly split.
[1079.68 --> 1080.80]  That's crazy.
[1080.80 --> 1081.00]  Is he?
[1082.56 --> 1088.60]  I think Sandy Bridge brought the understanding of the entire industry as a community up.
[1089.94 --> 1091.60]  And I think people held on.
[1092.02 --> 1095.00]  This is people saying, is it confusing in general now?
[1095.00 --> 1096.48]  Well, it's confusing now for sure.
[1096.50 --> 1097.16]  And it's a mess now.
[1097.16 --> 1097.26]  Yeah.
[1097.26 --> 1097.78]  Absolutely.
[1099.64 --> 1103.78]  But I think the knowledge base as a community has gone up.
[1103.84 --> 1104.08]  Okay.
[1104.08 --> 1110.62]  And you can argue like, oh, well, I was on overclocked.net back in 2003.
[1111.00 --> 1112.72]  And we understood way more back then.
[1113.42 --> 1113.84]  Sure.
[1114.02 --> 1114.20]  Yeah.
[1114.30 --> 1114.74]  Definitely.
[1115.00 --> 1118.24]  OCN is not a good sample to pick from though.
[1118.34 --> 1118.58]  Yeah.
[1118.76 --> 1119.62]  Because you're all hardcore.
[1119.70 --> 1123.00]  You guys are not representative of the general population.
[1123.24 --> 1123.94]  All the forum dudes.
[1124.52 --> 1124.80]  Yeah.
[1125.40 --> 1126.48]  Probably knew what was going on.
[1126.56 --> 1126.72]  Yeah.
[1126.80 --> 1127.74]  That's not who I'm talking about.
[1127.84 --> 1128.48]  I'm going a little bit...
[1128.48 --> 1133.52]  I mean forums as in like gaming forums and stuff, not like overclocking computer hardware
[1133.52 --> 1133.90]  forums.
[1134.04 --> 1135.44]  So this is an interesting point.
[1136.52 --> 1140.36]  On a cage in Twitch chat said something kind of insightful.
[1140.86 --> 1142.80]  LTT viewers are more technical in general.
[1142.94 --> 1147.06]  So if 50% of us see it as more confusing, regular people have no hope.
[1147.14 --> 1147.84]  I don't think that's...
[1147.84 --> 1153.02]  But what's interesting where I'm going with this is think about it this way.
[1153.02 --> 1157.98]  I think regular people who go, yeah, I get it.
[1158.44 --> 1163.86]  I3 is less than I5 is less than I7 would actually vote less confusing.
[1164.40 --> 1168.32]  Even if they didn't know it, but they were really confused.
[1168.80 --> 1170.26]  Or are totally wrong.
[1171.16 --> 1171.52]  Right?
[1171.76 --> 1172.20]  Definitely.
[1172.46 --> 1172.60]  Yeah.
[1173.14 --> 1173.76]  So...
[1173.76 --> 1175.92]  Which is what I liked about Sandy Bridge.
[1176.10 --> 1176.24]  Right.
[1176.36 --> 1177.44]  And then they just...
[1177.44 --> 1179.98]  Over years of different launches and releases.
[1180.00 --> 1180.26]  Okay.
[1180.32 --> 1181.18]  So this is interesting.
[1181.18 --> 1185.46]  This is a really good point from NFSM 654.
[1186.26 --> 1191.94]  With Sandy Bridge, some of the core i5s were dual core with onboard graphics.
[1192.34 --> 1197.12]  So this was before Intel standardized on onboard graphics being on everything.
[1197.34 --> 1204.24]  Because they were still building the iGPU on the package, but not onto the die yet.
[1204.24 --> 1209.68]  So quad core chips didn't have enough room for onboard graphics.
[1210.02 --> 1211.20]  And the dual cores did.
[1211.56 --> 1215.88]  Meaning that intercompatibility on motherboards was actually quite confusing.
[1215.90 --> 1216.72]  There was some wacky-backy stuff.
[1216.90 --> 1217.18]  Yeah.
[1217.98 --> 1218.24]  So...
[1218.78 --> 1219.92]  I still maintain.
[1220.28 --> 1222.44]  I think the overall knowledge base of the community went up.
[1222.44 --> 1225.32]  And some of that's definitely boiled into...
[1225.32 --> 1225.44]  Right.
[1225.44 --> 1225.66]  Okay.
[1225.66 --> 1227.82]  There was a really weird naming change that just happened.
[1228.00 --> 1228.66]  What's going on?
[1228.66 --> 1228.82]  Sorry.
[1228.86 --> 1229.62]  Did I say Sandy Bridge?
[1229.98 --> 1230.42]  Linfield.
[1230.60 --> 1231.04]  I'm sorry.
[1231.14 --> 1231.58]  Linfield.
[1231.76 --> 1232.16]  Linfield.
[1232.56 --> 1234.66]  I think a lot of it was what's going on.
[1234.70 --> 1237.26]  And people talking about the differences between different processors.
[1237.52 --> 1239.12]  And what threads are.
[1239.60 --> 1241.02]  And all of this other kind of stuff.
[1241.02 --> 1244.10]  And differences between threads and cores.
[1244.20 --> 1247.20]  A lot of these conversations started around the Sandy Bridge time.
[1247.38 --> 1250.36]  And a lot of people actually cared about processor specs.
[1250.78 --> 1251.00]  Right.
[1251.00 --> 1253.96]  And now it's kind of a mess.
[1254.92 --> 1257.10]  And a lot of people are interested in CPUs.
[1257.10 --> 1261.04]  But the more recent interest in CPUs has been, hey, there's competition now.
[1262.12 --> 1262.94]  What's better?
[1263.16 --> 1264.36]  Explain to me what's better.
[1264.46 --> 1265.54]  And that's because AMD showed up.
[1265.54 --> 1266.24]  Or hey, I like AMD.
[1267.90 --> 1269.86]  I finally have something to upgrade to.
[1270.24 --> 1270.44]  Woo!
[1272.02 --> 1273.92]  Apparently the cameras.
[1274.18 --> 1275.86]  I'm not necessarily saying that it was a good thing.
[1276.24 --> 1276.60]  I'm not saying.
[1276.98 --> 1278.20]  I'm just saying that the.
[1278.64 --> 1281.06]  I think the knowledge base as a whole increased at that time.
[1281.10 --> 1281.24]  Right.
[1281.34 --> 1282.08]  And I like that.
[1283.76 --> 1284.40]  All right.
[1284.96 --> 1286.08]  Let's move on to.
[1286.08 --> 1286.62]  The tilt is back.
[1286.76 --> 1287.20]  I don't know.
[1287.26 --> 1287.76]  I don't care anymore.
[1288.36 --> 1290.70]  Let's move on to the Galaxy S9.
[1290.70 --> 1297.70]  So this was posted in the forum by D13H4RD2LIVE.
[1298.88 --> 1300.38]  Die hard to live.
[1300.38 --> 1303.68]  In the very worst LeetSpeak of all.
[1305.28 --> 1306.66]  And there's no spaces.
[1307.28 --> 1307.50]  Yeah.
[1308.34 --> 1309.08]  But anyway.
[1309.08 --> 1316.42]  Did you notice that Edward the weeb had your, like, cat ear, long purple hair photo thing?
[1316.54 --> 1317.76]  That was his avatar?
[1318.28 --> 1318.42]  No.
[1318.72 --> 1319.50]  No, I did not.
[1319.50 --> 1319.90]  It was.
[1320.10 --> 1320.60]  All right.
[1320.72 --> 1324.02]  So the original article here is from TechCrunch.com.
[1324.66 --> 1325.30]  With the Galaxy.
[1325.30 --> 1329.46]  Their headline is, with the Galaxy S9, Samsung put the fingerprint sensor where it belongs.
[1329.52 --> 1333.34]  And I guess that's probably the headline because there isn't a whole lot else to say about it.
[1333.34 --> 1336.74]  I actually missed my briefing today that I was supposed to attend.
[1337.06 --> 1337.92]  Oh, no.
[1338.18 --> 1339.38]  I still don't have a device.
[1339.54 --> 1341.90]  How will we know what its specs and stuff are?
[1341.94 --> 1348.02]  But fortunately, sort of news flash for the Canadian PR team.
[1348.02 --> 1350.28]  The rest of the world is a thing.
[1350.86 --> 1352.32]  And the internet is a thing.
[1352.32 --> 1352.44]  Wow.
[1352.54 --> 1353.02]  The internet.
[1353.42 --> 1353.90]  Whoa.
[1354.12 --> 1358.38]  And so I can just read about this stuff on other publications' websites.
[1358.48 --> 1359.28]  That's amazing.
[1359.56 --> 1363.76]  Where they already know this stuff because they already had their briefings, like, a week ago.
[1363.76 --> 1366.50]  Not that I'm salty or upset or anything.
[1366.88 --> 1374.88]  It's just that it's, like, being in Canada is, like, a big dick slap sometimes.
[1377.00 --> 1378.90]  You don't matter as much.
[1379.34 --> 1379.70]  Yeah.
[1380.06 --> 1385.48]  Your population is literally one-tenth of the U.S., less than the state of California.
[1386.34 --> 1387.18]  You know what?
[1387.26 --> 1388.20]  We don't give a spit.
[1389.62 --> 1393.34]  Anyway, it's got the best DxOMark rating ever.
[1393.76 --> 1394.38]  Of 99.
[1394.92 --> 1399.06]  Though it should be noted that the Pixel 2 is at 98.
[1399.46 --> 1401.26]  And the iPhone 10 is at 97.
[1401.74 --> 1403.88]  So we really are splitting hairs at this point.
[1404.42 --> 1409.04]  Looks pretty similar to last gen, but better camera, as I just mentioned.
[1409.48 --> 1412.52]  Snapdragon 845 in the U.S. and China.
[1412.96 --> 1415.30]  And then Exynos, whatever the crap it is.
[1415.64 --> 1418.24]  Something 9, something, something elsewhere.
[1418.72 --> 1421.32]  They moved the fingerprint sensor to a more usable spot.
[1421.36 --> 1422.12]  I think I already said that.
[1422.12 --> 1423.92]  They're going to have Animojis.
[1430.12 --> 1433.08]  Though, to be clear, they're not normal emojis like Apple's.
[1433.10 --> 1435.58]  They're more like Wii Mii's or Bitmoji.
[1436.08 --> 1437.86]  Do you remember Mii's on the Nintendo Wii?
[1439.58 --> 1440.14]  Well, I don't know.
[1440.22 --> 1441.68]  Probably the biggest Nintendo fanboy you know, man.
[1441.68 --> 1442.68]  Did they have it on the Wii U?
[1443.10 --> 1443.32]  Yeah.
[1443.74 --> 1444.72]  Wait, did you have a Wii?
[1444.88 --> 1445.34]  You had a Wii.
[1445.48 --> 1445.66]  Yeah.
[1445.66 --> 1446.64]  Yeah, okay, never mind.
[1447.08 --> 1449.38]  I play more Wii now than I did when it launched.
[1449.84 --> 1451.10]  It's still great, actually.
[1451.46 --> 1453.04]  I only play Wii Sports.
[1454.02 --> 1454.18]  Yeah.
[1454.34 --> 1456.18]  My son loves Wii Sports.
[1456.58 --> 1457.58]  Wii Sports is amazing!
[1457.58 --> 1465.64]  I actually, I interrupt this very compelling news about the Samsung Galaxy S9 to bring you a personal confession.
[1466.26 --> 1468.48]  Something that is actually really hard for me to talk about.
[1468.64 --> 1470.74]  It's actually related to the Nintendo Wii.
[1470.74 --> 1476.88]  So, as some of you probably know, my son is about five and, uh...
[1476.88 --> 1478.04]  Wow, he's almost six!
[1478.14 --> 1478.62]  Holy crap.
[1478.62 --> 1479.76]  Wait, did he beat you at something?
[1479.96 --> 1480.34]  Shut up.
[1480.50 --> 1482.00]  Okay, let me just...
[1482.00 --> 1483.72]  I need to ease myself into this.
[1483.92 --> 1484.14]  Okay?
[1484.90 --> 1488.38]  So, my son is almost six and...
[1489.74 --> 1492.52]  Could you maybe enjoy this a little less?
[1494.04 --> 1495.10]  I'm so excited.
[1495.22 --> 1495.80]  Sorry, continue.
[1495.80 --> 1500.06]  My son is almost six...
[1500.06 --> 1501.54]  Shut up!
[1501.72 --> 1502.48]  Just keep going.
[1502.52 --> 1503.32]  Just chill out.
[1503.56 --> 1504.32]  I believe in you.
[1505.16 --> 1510.16]  So, my son is almost six and, um, he's been playing Wii.
[1510.34 --> 1513.12]  We actually created a Wii for him when he was, like, three and a half.
[1513.20 --> 1517.40]  I was, like, trying to see if, like, the stick waggling was simple enough that he could do it.
[1517.40 --> 1517.88]  It wasn't.
[1517.90 --> 1518.20]  He wasn't.
[1518.22 --> 1518.90]  He wasn't ready yet.
[1519.00 --> 1525.34]  But over probably the last year or so, he's gotten to the point where he actually uses the Wii.
[1525.80 --> 1530.90]  More than the Vive, which is depressing for a whole other set of reasons.
[1531.12 --> 1531.14]  Yeah.
[1531.94 --> 1541.14]  But he's gotten to the point where he's played enough Wii sports that, first, like, he was, like, a pro in Wii tennis.
[1541.52 --> 1541.74]  Right?
[1541.96 --> 1546.16]  You know how you can play against the computer and you get over a thousand skill level and you're a pro?
[1546.28 --> 1546.90]  At tennis?
[1547.46 --> 1548.20]  In the tennis one.
[1548.72 --> 1550.06]  Oh, the tennis one's pretty easy.
[1550.06 --> 1557.70]  Um, and, but he got to the point where he was not just a pro, but he had a skill level of, like, 1650 or something, which was more than mine.
[1557.78 --> 1559.08]  Mine was 1400 and something.
[1559.40 --> 1564.60]  But the reason that my skill level wasn't very high was I never played single player.
[1564.80 --> 1568.98]  I would always play against my wife or, like, um, my sister-in-law.
[1568.98 --> 1573.88]  Because the last time I used the Wii was when I still lived with my wife's parents.
[1574.76 --> 1579.52]  So it was, like, the family console and we'd, like, tool around on Sunday night playing Wii sports or whatever.
[1579.68 --> 1579.92]  Yeah, yeah.
[1580.02 --> 1580.26]  Okay.
[1580.66 --> 1583.64]  So, so I was quite a bit better than my skill level would indicate.
[1583.84 --> 1587.80]  So he would, like, he would go all, like, five-year-old kind of sulky.
[1587.80 --> 1591.68]  He would say, my skill level's higher, but you still beat me.
[1592.30 --> 1597.70]  Like, without, without even using, like, the cheap return whenever you miss a power smash.
[1597.90 --> 1604.44]  There's a cheap return that if you time, it's not even that hard to time, but it's ungettable on both the forehand and the backhand if they don't manage to power serve.
[1605.26 --> 1609.44]  Um, and so I would beat him, like, without even using that.
[1610.98 --> 1614.52]  Then, and he'd complain, he'd be whining about it.
[1614.52 --> 1619.08]  Then, like, a couple months later, I'm playing against him, and he takes a set.
[1619.60 --> 1622.46]  And I'm just, like, ah, okay.
[1623.00 --> 1624.38]  Like, I wasn't really paying attention.
[1624.50 --> 1627.42]  I was holding the baby in the other hand, and I was, like, ah, shoot.
[1627.90 --> 1628.36]  Well, okay.
[1628.94 --> 1630.34]  Um, darling, can you get down?
[1630.48 --> 1632.60]  I gotta, I gotta beat your brother at Wii tennis.
[1633.08 --> 1635.32]  Um, then he takes another set.
[1636.08 --> 1637.92]  And I go, what?
[1639.06 --> 1641.68]  So I'm, like, okay, full-on cheap mode now.
[1642.08 --> 1643.90]  So I'm, I'm doing cheap returns.
[1643.90 --> 1645.08]  Like, ungettable returns.
[1645.38 --> 1647.18]  I'm power serving everything to him.
[1648.10 --> 1649.00]  And I win it.
[1649.48 --> 1649.88]  Okay.
[1649.98 --> 1651.82]  So I take, I take three sets in a row.
[1651.88 --> 1653.60]  And he's, like, oh, I almost beat you.
[1654.54 --> 1659.12]  Literally, like, two weeks later, he, he sweeps me.
[1659.86 --> 1662.86]  And I'm, like, is this petty?
[1663.48 --> 1664.14]  You know what?
[1664.16 --> 1664.56]  I don't care.
[1664.70 --> 1665.10]  Rematch.
[1665.72 --> 1666.68]  I ask for a rematch.
[1666.68 --> 1670.42]  I ask my five-year-old son for a rematch.
[1670.42 --> 1674.06]  He beats me again.
[1674.40 --> 1675.20]  Three straight.
[1675.98 --> 1677.38]  Three straight again.
[1677.38 --> 1686.64]  I don't even feel bad about him kicking my ass at Wii boxing.
[1686.96 --> 1691.18]  Because Wii boxing is, quite frankly, just who can flail the best.
[1691.36 --> 1694.54]  And I'll, like, I'll play against him and I'll, like, try and time punches.
[1694.70 --> 1697.32]  And it's just, like, come on!
[1697.40 --> 1698.48]  It's better to flail.
[1698.62 --> 1699.84]  Like, it's actually better to flail.
[1699.90 --> 1700.58]  And it's so funny.
[1700.66 --> 1702.98]  The way he plays it is so funny.
[1702.98 --> 1705.32]  I have a video of him doing this that I'm saving for his wedding.
[1706.22 --> 1711.04]  But instead of just, like, going like this, he gets his whole body going.
[1711.42 --> 1712.98]  And it's just, like...
[1712.98 --> 1721.84]  So the kid, the kid will, like, he'll come out of playing a couple games of Wii boxing, like, drenched.
[1722.18 --> 1723.60]  And I'm, like, wow, this is great.
[1723.60 --> 1728.64]  Because the whole idea behind the Wii was that it was more physical.
[1728.88 --> 1729.24]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1729.32 --> 1734.94]  Until, like, jackasses like me figured out that they could play Twilight Princess like this.
[1735.12 --> 1735.32]  Yeah.
[1737.66 --> 1738.26]  You know?
[1738.94 --> 1742.84]  And, like, yeah, I'm still joystick waggling or whatever, but I'm not moving.
[1743.04 --> 1743.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[1745.06 --> 1747.80]  So I can still kick his butt at golf.
[1748.54 --> 1750.20]  I can still crush him at bowling.
[1750.26 --> 1751.80]  I actually almost got a perfect game.
[1751.80 --> 1752.62]  Ooh.
[1752.90 --> 1757.10]  I missed one pin on the first one, which made me feel a lot better.
[1757.58 --> 1760.92]  Then all strikes through to the end, and then I missed one pin on the end.
[1760.98 --> 1763.26]  So I'm actually really glad I missed that one pin at the beginning,
[1763.34 --> 1766.56]  because otherwise that one at the end would have destroyed me as a person.
[1768.04 --> 1769.44]  Yeah, Wii U Sports Club.
[1770.00 --> 1771.50]  Oh, is there a Wii U one?
[1771.70 --> 1771.90]  Yeah.
[1771.96 --> 1772.58]  Oh, okay, cool.
[1773.02 --> 1773.90]  Maybe I should get a Wii U.
[1774.50 --> 1775.48]  It's probably cheap.
[1775.94 --> 1776.30]  Yeah.
[1777.62 --> 1779.48]  And then what's the last game?
[1779.48 --> 1782.64]  Oh, the baseball on the Wii is just stupid.
[1783.44 --> 1788.30]  Like, yeah, he beat me at baseball, but, like, baseball is just a matter of, like, who luckily
[1788.30 --> 1793.52]  connects with a pitch, because as soon as a human is pitching, you could just throw all
[1793.52 --> 1795.26]  the cheapest garbage, and it's, like, unhittable.
[1795.42 --> 1797.00]  Do you have the improved sensors?
[1797.22 --> 1797.72]  I don't.
[1798.06 --> 1798.44]  Oh, okay.
[1798.44 --> 1801.74]  I don't think Wii Sports is Wii Motion Plus compatible, though, so I don't think it matters.
[1802.42 --> 1802.54]  Yeah.
[1802.54 --> 1808.66]  The Wii U controllers have it built in, and they're the same size as the default controllers.
[1808.84 --> 1809.16]  Oh, okay.
[1809.16 --> 1809.96]  Which is kind of nice.
[1810.16 --> 1810.36]  Cool.
[1810.90 --> 1815.50]  And I believe all Wii U games work with it, because it's the default controller.
[1815.64 --> 1815.84]  Yeah.
[1816.00 --> 1816.26]  Okay.
[1816.26 --> 1821.08]  Well, maybe I'll get a Wii U at some point, but anyway, that was my confession.
[1821.48 --> 1822.58]  It actually happened.
[1823.04 --> 1824.84]  I was actually trying.
[1824.96 --> 1825.18]  Already.
[1825.18 --> 1825.86]  Not just trying.
[1826.00 --> 1826.28]  Already.
[1826.40 --> 1829.96]  Like, I was hitting cheap shots that I knew he didn't know about.
[1830.26 --> 1835.98]  This is like playing, like, NHLPA 94 and doing wraparounds on the bottom.
[1836.08 --> 1836.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1836.78 --> 1838.42]  When someone else doesn't know about it.
[1838.50 --> 1839.38]  Like, that is...
[1839.38 --> 1840.14]  To be fair...
[1840.14 --> 1841.32]  That's how I was playing.
[1841.44 --> 1844.12]  Wraparounds are pretty easy to, like, pick up on if someone's doing it to you.
[1844.12 --> 1844.60]  Yeah.
[1844.72 --> 1845.08]  But, yeah.
[1846.14 --> 1846.96]  Dude, man.
[1847.14 --> 1847.92]  Like, I...
[1847.92 --> 1849.72]  That's pretty rough.
[1849.92 --> 1850.30]  Yeah.
[1851.18 --> 1857.20]  What is the number one game that would hurt for him to be better than you at?
[1857.86 --> 1860.30]  You know, I'm not really that good at anything.
[1861.80 --> 1866.00]  Like, there's games where I just really wouldn't expect him to ever be better than me.
[1866.14 --> 1868.20]  Like, I don't think he'll ever be better at a side-scroller.
[1868.50 --> 1868.64]  Yeah.
[1868.66 --> 1870.18]  Just because that genre is not really popular.
[1870.52 --> 1872.46]  Like, modern side-scrollers, what, like, Trine?
[1872.90 --> 1874.40]  Like, that's not a...
[1874.40 --> 1875.28]  Yeah, not so much.
[1875.36 --> 1875.92]  Like, I...
[1875.92 --> 1878.66]  There's some, like, really niche, like, ultra-hardcore...
[1878.66 --> 1882.58]  Yeah, like, you could argue the Super Meat Boy is a modern-ish side-scroller.
[1882.70 --> 1884.24]  But even that's, like, years old.
[1884.24 --> 1886.00]  And, like, it's a dying...
[1886.00 --> 1886.32]  It's...
[1886.32 --> 1887.32]  It was like a...
[1887.32 --> 1887.48]  Yeah.
[1887.60 --> 1888.66]  It was like the...
[1888.66 --> 1891.58]  You, like, press down on the chest of the corpse, and it's like...
[1891.58 --> 1893.54]  Like, it's not breathing anymore.
[1893.70 --> 1894.24]  It's just...
[1894.24 --> 1895.98]  Like, a last...
[1895.98 --> 1897.58]  Last gasp, so to speak.
[1899.10 --> 1900.00]  Cuphead doesn't...
[1900.00 --> 1900.30]  No.
[1900.30 --> 1901.06]  Like, I...
[1901.06 --> 1901.88]  So, yeah, I wouldn't...
[1901.88 --> 1903.08]  Yeah, Cuphead's not...
[1903.08 --> 1903.70]  That's not...
[1903.70 --> 1905.44]  It's not Super Mario World.
[1905.60 --> 1905.82]  Yeah.
[1905.90 --> 1906.22]  It's...
[1906.22 --> 1907.54]  It's more advanced than that.
[1907.62 --> 1908.06]  There's more...
[1908.06 --> 1909.28]  There's a lot more to it.
[1909.54 --> 1909.56]  Yeah.
[1909.56 --> 1911.68]  So, if he were to beat me...
[1911.68 --> 1916.98]  Like, if he were to be better than me at, like, Super Mario World, I'd feel pretty devastated.
[1917.30 --> 1918.82]  But I don't expect that to happen.
[1918.94 --> 1919.90]  It would be kind of like...
[1919.90 --> 1923.74]  It would be kind of like me being better at shuffleboard than my grandparents.
[1923.74 --> 1928.62]  Like, yeah, if I put enough time into it, I could probably do it, but I wouldn't care.
[1928.86 --> 1929.66]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1929.66 --> 1929.96]  Yeah, yeah.
[1930.08 --> 1931.60]  Like, I'd be concerned about him.
[1932.02 --> 1935.10]  If you care that much about old games.
[1935.94 --> 1936.64]  I hear you.
[1936.86 --> 1937.46]  So...
[1937.46 --> 1938.24]  Badminton.
[1939.22 --> 1939.66]  No.
[1939.92 --> 1942.40]  I fully expect him to be better at me than...
[1942.40 --> 1943.28]  Better than me at badminton.
[1943.38 --> 1943.94]  Because he's starting really early.
[1943.96 --> 1945.28]  I am planning to be...
[1945.28 --> 1946.28]  When do you think that'll happen?
[1946.36 --> 1951.18]  I'm going to be paying, like, $75 an hour for badminton coaching for him within the next few months.
[1951.18 --> 1951.78]  Oh.
[1952.14 --> 1953.22]  Like, he is going to...
[1953.22 --> 1953.90]  You're going prodigy level.
[1953.98 --> 1958.52]  He's going to the best badminton facility in Canada.
[1959.04 --> 1959.22]  Oh.
[1959.32 --> 1960.34]  He is going to be...
[1960.34 --> 1961.20]  It's here, actually.
[1961.38 --> 1961.50]  Oh.
[1961.68 --> 1962.04]  Arguably.
[1962.52 --> 1964.52]  There's been more national-level players.
[1964.52 --> 1965.04]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1965.14 --> 1968.06]  But other places have done well, too.
[1968.24 --> 1969.56]  They've had good products as well.
[1970.24 --> 1974.94]  And then, if he's good enough, I would happily pay for him to train overseas if it comes to that.
[1975.36 --> 1979.96]  So, as far as I'm concerned, if he is not beating me at badminton by the time he's about 11 or 12,
[1979.96 --> 1981.38]  then we need to reevaluate.
[1982.50 --> 1983.48]  Because I'm not that good.
[1984.48 --> 1984.84]  So...
[1984.84 --> 1986.50]  He's into it, yeah?
[1986.82 --> 1987.40]  He likes it.
[1987.48 --> 1987.84]  Yeah, yeah.
[1987.86 --> 1988.64]  Because you've already brought him.
[1988.64 --> 1990.56]  No, he's already playing a couple times a week.
[1990.66 --> 1990.68]  I wanted to make sure...
[1990.68 --> 1991.28]  I knew that.
[1991.36 --> 1996.78]  I wanted to get that out of you so the Twitch chat knows that you're not just being with, like, that kind of dad.
[1996.98 --> 1997.12]  Yeah.
[1997.20 --> 1998.50]  He's already playing a couple times a week.
[1998.56 --> 1999.22]  He likes it.
[1999.42 --> 1999.58]  Yeah.
[1999.58 --> 2002.16]  I also fully expect him to be better at martial arts than me.
[2002.34 --> 2006.58]  Although, by the time he gets, like, a...
[2006.58 --> 2007.90]  Oh, shoot.
[2007.96 --> 2010.62]  This is going to happen sooner than I had sort of thought about.
[2010.72 --> 2014.54]  But by the time he hits, like, 9 or 10 and he hits sort of, like, red-brown belt,
[2014.64 --> 2018.14]  I'm probably going to have to try and get back into it so I don't get past too quickly there.
[2018.28 --> 2019.04]  But, yeah.
[2019.16 --> 2021.62]  I fully expect him to be better than me at everything.
[2021.74 --> 2023.02]  If he's not, then I've failed as a parent.
[2023.08 --> 2023.72]  Because that's your job.
[2024.70 --> 2026.38]  Can I be, like, a boss along the way?
[2027.10 --> 2027.72]  A boss?
[2027.96 --> 2028.22]  Yeah.
[2028.88 --> 2032.72]  I think he's probably going to be quite a bit smaller than you forever.
[2034.22 --> 2035.24]  Have you seen his mother?
[2035.44 --> 2036.32]  But he'll be more skilled.
[2036.60 --> 2037.30]  He'll be more skilled.
[2037.30 --> 2041.00]  He'll be, like, the light character that you choose on the fighter screen.
[2041.02 --> 2049.62]  The funny thing about that is there's a reason that, like, the UFC doesn't have heavyweights fight lightweights.
[2050.46 --> 2050.56]  Okay.
[2050.56 --> 2053.66]  Chun-Li wouldn't actually stand a chance against Blanca.
[2054.48 --> 2058.08]  But the little dude that teaches me jiu-jitsu can kick my butt.
[2059.28 --> 2060.26]  So that's a thing.
[2060.56 --> 2060.90]  Okay.
[2061.52 --> 2062.22]  Eventually I'll get there.
[2062.22 --> 2066.90]  With that said, if you weren't jiu-jitsu-ing and you just went for a football tackle,
[2067.46 --> 2069.40]  does that still go down that way?
[2069.52 --> 2070.18]  Probably not.
[2071.04 --> 2072.30]  He's a very nice guy.
[2072.60 --> 2072.74]  Okay.
[2074.80 --> 2078.44]  So within the constraints of the sport, you get your butt kicked.
[2078.44 --> 2078.84]  Yeah.
[2078.84 --> 2087.52]  But speaking of within the constraints of Wancho, sponsor spots.
[2089.22 --> 2091.14]  Let's start with Synergy 2.
[2091.62 --> 2099.82]  If you have two computers or more and you have one desk, Synergy 2 is the way to go.
[2099.82 --> 2106.48]  It's a software-based mouse and keyboard sharing solution that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.
[2106.70 --> 2108.14]  Is that out on Floatplane yet?
[2108.16 --> 2110.64]  Because that is a sick video.
[2110.76 --> 2111.62]  Do you know about this yet?
[2111.88 --> 2112.26]  No.
[2112.26 --> 2114.98]  We did a showcase piece for Synergy.
[2115.76 --> 2121.22]  And we were kind of sitting around going like, okay, how do we do this?
[2121.64 --> 2121.90]  Yeah.
[2122.14 --> 2124.06]  There is an export for this.
[2124.12 --> 2124.86]  I'm just going to pull it up.
[2124.90 --> 2126.80]  I don't think it's actually live on Floatplane yet.
[2127.12 --> 2129.26]  But I'm going to pull this up because it's really cool.
[2129.34 --> 2130.48]  I just want to show the demo here.
[2130.98 --> 2138.20]  But we were sitting around going, you know, how do we do a video for Synergy that's not just a shill piece?
[2138.20 --> 2139.68]  That's like actually cool.
[2140.02 --> 2141.68]  And we were like, oh, I don't know.
[2141.76 --> 2144.64]  Maybe we could just do a shill piece and then it might actually be cool.
[2144.82 --> 2146.12]  And it worked out really well.
[2146.24 --> 2146.78]  Check this out.
[2152.80 --> 2153.20]  Okay.
[2153.36 --> 2156.68]  That ended up being a little more dramatic than I hoped.
[2157.02 --> 2158.52]  I'm just going to skip ahead to.
[2158.52 --> 2159.20]  Okay.
[2159.26 --> 2160.14]  Check this out.
[2160.74 --> 2162.06]  So they're all firing up.
[2162.50 --> 2167.26]  That's Windows 7, OS X, or Mac OS, sorry.
[2167.26 --> 2169.32]  Windows 10 and Linux.
[2169.94 --> 2173.26]  And then what I can do with this monitor.
[2173.46 --> 2174.52]  This is that LG monitor.
[2175.00 --> 2175.76]  That's cool.
[2175.94 --> 2176.34]  Right?
[2176.56 --> 2177.08]  That's cool.
[2177.28 --> 2180.88]  And then you can switch full screen with the remote for the monitor.
[2181.00 --> 2182.16]  So I was using the remote there.
[2182.52 --> 2190.28]  You can just go, you can get out of picture by picture and go full screen to any one of them in 4K60.
[2191.04 --> 2195.42]  And then you can press another button to go back to your tile setup.
[2196.34 --> 2197.12]  Cool, right?
[2197.26 --> 2198.02]  That is pretty cool.
[2198.84 --> 2205.88]  So you can effectively be using four different operating system workstations at once.
[2206.62 --> 2209.00]  And switch between full screen and having all of them.
[2209.30 --> 2210.60]  And then when they're all on.
[2210.68 --> 2212.98]  So there's a toggle for Synergy 2 that they're adding.
[2213.52 --> 2217.68]  Or they'll have either added it by the time this goes live or they've added it already.
[2217.68 --> 2226.66]  So that through the task bar of any one of them, you can toggle Synergy 2 on and off so that when you go full screen, your mouse doesn't fly off the edges.
[2226.66 --> 2227.06]  Yeah, yeah.
[2227.06 --> 2234.80]  Because all of the full screen versus not full screen, that's being handled in hardware by the monitor, not by the Seamless 2 software.
[2234.82 --> 2235.94]  That's a really cool setup.
[2236.06 --> 2236.64]  Isn't it?
[2236.64 --> 2241.20]  I can actually think of a lot of different industries that would like that.
[2241.40 --> 2242.16]  Oh, absolutely.
[2242.16 --> 2244.34]  So it's one of those niche things.
[2244.58 --> 2247.40]  But for the people who are into that, pretty freaking cool.
[2247.74 --> 2252.68]  So anyway, Synergy 2 makes it easier than ever to mouse and keyboard share between multiple systems.
[2253.64 --> 2257.56]  They've got new networking backend that helps with complex networks.
[2257.56 --> 2262.16]  They've got, oh, the SSL encryption has been moved from the pro to the basic tier.
[2262.62 --> 2264.34]  So all users can benefit from encryption.
[2265.06 --> 2269.90]  And the new background service on all platforms lets users control all their machines before they're even logged into the computer.
[2270.26 --> 2272.60]  So get 50% off your purchase of Synergy 2.
[2272.72 --> 2274.60]  We'll have that linked down.
[2274.78 --> 2274.96]  Whoops.
[2275.78 --> 2277.32]  There is the...
[2277.32 --> 2279.56]  Synergy at seamless.com slash synergy slash WAN4.
[2280.28 --> 2282.36]  Do you mind throwing that in the chat just in case anyone wants to check it out?
[2283.52 --> 2286.34]  Also sponsoring the WAN show today is Honey.
[2286.34 --> 2291.60]  Honey is a free browser extension that automatically finds the best coupons on the web.
[2291.68 --> 2294.26]  So you always get the best price on stuff you buy online.
[2294.44 --> 2300.38]  While you shop, it will instantly find any working coupon code it can and apply the best discount to your cart at checkout.
[2300.98 --> 2304.16]  Honey saves you time because they test the coupon codes to make sure they work.
[2304.40 --> 2306.42]  And they test over a million codes every month.
[2306.60 --> 2310.62]  They've partnered with lots of online retailers like eBay and Newegg to help you find the best deals.
[2310.70 --> 2312.42]  And they don't sell your personal information.
[2313.14 --> 2316.24]  In some cases, it should be noted, when you use a coupon with Honey,
[2316.34 --> 2317.80]  they earn a small commission from the merchant.
[2318.06 --> 2321.14]  But they don't sell your data or give your information to third parties either.
[2321.56 --> 2323.88]  So there's no reason not to add Honey to your browser today.
[2323.94 --> 2324.32]  It's free.
[2324.44 --> 2326.34]  It just takes two clicks and it will save you money.
[2326.56 --> 2330.82]  So go join Honey at honey.com slash Linus or click the link below.
[2331.28 --> 2333.00]  Join honey.com slash Linus.
[2333.00 --> 2335.92]  Bringing us to our last sponsor, Madrina's Coffee.
[2336.44 --> 2338.40]  Which has a really cool offer right now, actually.
[2338.80 --> 2339.52]  Oh, what's the offer?
[2339.82 --> 2340.70]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[2340.74 --> 2341.56]  Let's get through what it is.
[2341.64 --> 2345.62]  So Madrina's Coffee is a high quality canned coffee drink or not canned.
[2345.72 --> 2345.94]  Or.
[2346.10 --> 2347.12]  If you're into not canned as well.
[2347.20 --> 2347.78]  Yeah, there you go.
[2347.78 --> 2349.24]  They've got tons of different blends.
[2349.56 --> 2353.94]  They've got big cans of cold brew with a flavor for everyone from sweet and creamy like their mocha or caramel
[2353.94 --> 2357.70]  to bold, roasty flavors like cold brew black and dark roast.
[2358.78 --> 2361.56]  Brought to you in a convenient, ready-to-drink 16-ounce can.
[2362.78 --> 2363.22]  Yep.
[2363.22 --> 2366.64]  This size is for people who love coffee, not for people who like coffee, okay?
[2366.84 --> 2373.16]  And speaking of which, from now until March 9th, you can get 60% off your Madrina's Coffee order with discount code Linus.
[2373.28 --> 2380.70]  And as of like right now, the first 100 people to use offer code Linus get a free six-pack of cold brew.
[2381.02 --> 2383.46]  These guys automatically added to the order.
[2383.78 --> 2384.08]  Boom.
[2384.30 --> 2387.72]  Go to madrinascoffee.com slash Linus.
[2387.94 --> 2389.92]  Shipping is currently limited to the U.S. only.
[2390.04 --> 2390.68]  Sorry, everybody.
[2391.60 --> 2392.16]  Owned us.
[2392.16 --> 2394.14]  Because the cold brews are so big and heavy.
[2394.56 --> 2401.04]  However, for the international drinkers, Madrina's will offer six-ounce bags of micro-roast beans available worldwide.
[2401.46 --> 2404.32]  So if you guys have any questions about the flavors or how to order,
[2404.62 --> 2407.44]  Shlomo from Madrina's is actually in the Twitch chat now.
[2408.20 --> 2408.78]  So there you go.
[2409.10 --> 2411.82]  Feel free to bug and pester him as much as you want.
[2411.82 --> 2412.82]  So quick.
[2413.06 --> 2417.08]  First 100 people, three six-pack, go.
[2417.30 --> 2418.64]  Also 60% off.
[2419.18 --> 2419.78]  Holy crap.
[2420.18 --> 2421.06]  Go, go, go.
[2421.06 --> 2426.08]  But also pay attention to the rest of the WAN show because we're important too.
[2426.46 --> 2428.40]  Should we get back to the Galaxy S9?
[2428.54 --> 2429.20]  Do we even care?
[2429.82 --> 2430.12]  It's a phone.
[2430.12 --> 2431.52]  960 FPS slow-mo.
[2431.60 --> 2432.20]  That's cool.
[2432.56 --> 2433.00]  HD.
[2433.26 --> 2434.32]  For 0.2 seconds.
[2434.40 --> 2434.72]  0.2 seconds.
[2435.08 --> 2436.42]  So probably end trigger, I guess?
[2436.66 --> 2437.54]  I'm hoping so.
[2437.54 --> 2445.28]  Oh, instead of trying to time your button press, it will apparently AI try to detect where the action is in the clip and apply slow-mo to that part.
[2445.28 --> 2454.12]  Yeah, I guess at 0.2 seconds, you wouldn't even have time for end trigger.
[2457.12 --> 2457.56]  Okay.
[2457.94 --> 2458.36]  We'll see.
[2459.38 --> 2460.40]  This is interesting.
[2460.40 --> 2462.40]  So the original article here is from Anantek.
[2462.46 --> 2468.02]  I was just browsing through, and I don't really know how this wasn't bigger news.
[2468.58 --> 2472.28]  I mean, Anantek called it awkward first results.
[2472.38 --> 2473.42]  That's one way of putting it.
[2473.42 --> 2480.76]  But in a nutshell, it'll be either Exynos 9810 or Snapdragon 845.
[2481.30 --> 2488.72]  And if we go down, what's the final clock speed that they'll use?
[2488.86 --> 2489.64]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2489.84 --> 2490.80]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2491.40 --> 2491.92]  Active.
[2492.24 --> 2492.92]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2493.20 --> 2493.96]  Memory latency.
[2495.14 --> 2496.00]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[2497.14 --> 2497.54]  Okay.
[2498.74 --> 2499.92]  Big little design.
[2500.12 --> 2500.82]  Here we go.
[2500.92 --> 2501.60]  Here we go.
[2501.60 --> 2502.06]  Ooh.
[2502.06 --> 2502.42]  Ooh.
[2503.34 --> 2505.98]  So Geekbench 4 single core performance.
[2506.84 --> 2514.22]  Snapdragon 845 got absolutely crushed by the 9810.
[2515.16 --> 2516.68]  How very interesting.
[2519.16 --> 2521.22]  Last generation, et cetera, et cetera.
[2521.54 --> 2521.72]  Okay.
[2521.96 --> 2522.42]  Again.
[2522.80 --> 2523.20]  Oh, wait.
[2523.28 --> 2524.58]  That's still Geekbench 4.
[2524.72 --> 2525.38]  That splits it out.
[2525.48 --> 2527.08]  PCMark work 2.0.
[2527.08 --> 2532.40]  So the 9810 does not crush the Snapdragon 845 here.
[2533.30 --> 2533.86]  Where is it?
[2533.92 --> 2534.04]  Yep.
[2534.20 --> 2534.48]  There.
[2534.70 --> 2536.36]  Snapdragon 845 is right up on the top.
[2536.50 --> 2537.08]  But basically...
[2537.80 --> 2538.12]  Oh.
[2538.24 --> 2538.88]  Thank you for that.
[2540.20 --> 2540.58]  Okay.
[2540.78 --> 2542.36]  What seems very clear is something's wrong.
[2542.36 --> 2543.94]  Oh, no.
[2544.84 --> 2545.24]  Oh.
[2546.14 --> 2548.08]  Luke was plugging in my power.
[2548.36 --> 2549.72]  Did I actually not make it?
[2549.88 --> 2551.20]  Almost got it.
[2551.38 --> 2552.40]  By like milliseconds?
[2552.68 --> 2553.98]  Almost got it.
[2554.22 --> 2555.14]  Oh, man.
[2555.72 --> 2556.72]  Oh, that was great.
[2557.50 --> 2557.70]  Oh.
[2557.70 --> 2558.04]  But...
[2558.04 --> 2558.78]  No, it's fine.
[2558.82 --> 2559.32]  They can't see it.
[2560.76 --> 2561.12]  Okay.
[2563.58 --> 2564.46]  Oh, man.
[2564.60 --> 2564.80]  Okay.
[2564.92 --> 2566.94]  So clearly there's something kind of wrong.
[2567.48 --> 2570.18]  And basically the writer checked in with Samsung.
[2570.52 --> 2571.18]  Here we go.
[2572.22 --> 2573.84]  I did get confirmation.
[2574.62 --> 2574.82]  Okay.
[2574.86 --> 2575.24]  Here we go.
[2575.90 --> 2582.10]  Samsung spokesman confirmed that the demo unit was running special firmware for Mobile World Conference.
[2582.44 --> 2583.86]  So these results...
[2583.86 --> 2586.48]  Because you can clearly see they're totally bunged up.
[2586.48 --> 2594.88]  Because the PCMark score has the Exynos 9810 getting creamed by even the last generation Exynos.
[2594.98 --> 2595.20]  Yeah.
[2596.20 --> 2597.56]  Last generation Snapdragon.
[2598.24 --> 2600.36]  And, of course, current generation Snapdragon.
[2600.64 --> 2602.72]  So clearly something's wrong here.
[2603.38 --> 2607.70]  So confirmation that the demo units were running a special firmware and they might not be optimized.
[2609.40 --> 2613.64]  He's having a hard time believing they would so drastically limit the performance of the device for show units.
[2613.86 --> 2615.60]  Honestly, I don't find that that hard to believe.
[2615.60 --> 2621.14]  All kinds of games get played with phone firmware for shows and even for reviewers.
[2621.74 --> 2622.44]  But check this out.
[2623.10 --> 2631.76]  Did get confirmation that Samsung is planning to tune down the Exynos variant to match Snapdragon performance.
[2633.68 --> 2634.28]  Wow.
[2634.28 --> 2637.54]  So I'm actually not sure how that wasn't bigger news.
[2637.54 --> 2642.62]  Because I can see a lot of different ways that people can get upset about this.
[2642.62 --> 2646.64]  And I can't see a lot of ways where people wouldn't be a little bit upset about this.
[2646.64 --> 2649.26]  So the two ways I can see people being upset.
[2649.36 --> 2654.70]  Upset number one would be if I got a Snapdragon 845 Galaxy S9.
[2654.98 --> 2656.96]  Because there's always controversy there.
[2657.10 --> 2657.20]  Yeah.
[2657.20 --> 2659.20]  And with Apple, it was even...
[2659.86 --> 2660.58]  So what was it?
[2660.62 --> 2664.66]  A10 was the first one they did it on where they dual sourced from TSMC and...
[2664.66 --> 2665.98]  And then one of them was better than the other.
[2665.98 --> 2666.20]  I forget.
[2666.42 --> 2666.52]  Yeah.
[2666.56 --> 2671.54]  One of them was arguably sometimes better than the other.
[2671.62 --> 2674.22]  And it was mostly in terms of battery life where people were getting upset.
[2674.30 --> 2676.60]  Because one of them was a little bit more power efficient.
[2676.84 --> 2677.80]  But it was close enough.
[2677.90 --> 2679.44]  I think it was within 5%.
[2679.44 --> 2685.58]  Like it was close enough that you were also playing around with the variations in battery capacity at that point.
[2687.20 --> 2691.70]  So I can see people being upset about getting the perceived trashier chip.
[2692.10 --> 2696.18]  The other thing I could see people being upset about is if you're in the European or Asian market.
[2696.18 --> 2700.10]  And you've got an Exynos 8895.
[2700.52 --> 2701.52]  Having it be nerfed.
[2701.88 --> 2703.40]  And see, this is probably one of those situations...
[2703.40 --> 2704.38]  You're like, yo, what's up, Samsung?
[2704.38 --> 2704.58]  Samsung?
[2705.32 --> 2710.78]  This is probably one of those situations where Samsung realized that these problems could happen.
[2711.44 --> 2715.66]  So they decided to try to quietly make them the same so that people wouldn't argue.
[2716.14 --> 2719.34]  Which, you know, from a certain standpoint, I kind of understand.
[2719.58 --> 2721.90]  They're like, we just don't want people to freak out.
[2722.64 --> 2724.66]  So if we make everything the same, then it's great.
[2724.74 --> 2727.54]  But then people are going to freak out because then they should have gotten an advantage.
[2728.10 --> 2728.98]  Is this Samsung...
[2728.98 --> 2729.68]  There's no way around it.
[2729.68 --> 2737.60]  Is this Samsung kind of going, well, you know, the Canadian region probably won't care about this phone...
[2737.60 --> 2740.82]  Until such time as it's available through Canadian carriers.
[2741.08 --> 2742.78]  So let's just not bother briefing them.
[2743.18 --> 2745.42]  Like, is this them going, you know what?
[2746.08 --> 2751.64]  You know, outside of the U.S., Americans probably don't read, you know, non-American news outlets.
[2751.64 --> 2754.92]  So they're probably not going to, like, look that closely at the Exynos version.
[2754.92 --> 2760.50]  So, like, as long as we seed all the U.S. outlets with Snapdragon ones, it should be fine.
[2760.58 --> 2761.00]  Like, are they...
[2761.00 --> 2766.66]  Is this them going, okay, as long as we keep it contained within a region, then no one will figure this out?
[2766.92 --> 2769.20]  And, you know, the mainstream consumer probably wouldn't.
[2769.86 --> 2770.96]  Is that what's happening here?
[2773.24 --> 2773.60]  Wow.
[2774.24 --> 2775.36]  I think...
[2775.36 --> 2781.60]  Okay, so I think it's been proven many, many, many times that nerds are going to figure it out.
[2781.98 --> 2782.92]  Mainstream consumer, no.
[2783.04 --> 2784.44]  Mainstream consumer is not going to care.
[2784.92 --> 2786.36]  There's an iterative number.
[2786.72 --> 2790.98]  They're going to see it's the S9, and they'll want it if they're getting a new phone for whatever reason.
[2791.30 --> 2791.58]  Okay.
[2791.84 --> 2796.80]  I've got a lot of people asking this, and we really need to address it.
[2797.86 --> 2803.26]  I can't find the first person who asked it, but let's go down to this one.
[2803.86 --> 2804.62]  Who was it?
[2805.10 --> 2805.74]  Oh, man.
[2807.00 --> 2807.74]  Something, something.
[2807.74 --> 2808.46]  Okay, whatever.
[2808.58 --> 2810.98]  The question is, why...
[2810.98 --> 2811.46]  Here we go.
[2812.96 --> 2813.52]  Derfuhrer123.
[2813.60 --> 2814.08]  Oh, seriously.
[2814.08 --> 2815.14]  Why did I read that?
[2816.42 --> 2820.46]  Why doesn't Samsung use Exynos in the U.S. and China?
[2821.24 --> 2830.00]  And then another person asked, why does Samsung, a designer and fabricator of mobile CPUs...
[2830.00 --> 2830.92]  Not use their...
[2830.92 --> 2834.56]  Why do they use Qualcomm CPUs in their phones?
[2835.24 --> 2842.34]  And the answer is actually a little more interesting than you might at first think.
[2843.34 --> 2846.30]  There was a different word I was looking for, and I'm...
[2846.30 --> 2846.76]  Complicated?
[2846.76 --> 2849.78]  No, it was like delicate, but it wasn't delicate.
[2849.96 --> 2852.88]  It was a little more subtle, a little more...
[2854.06 --> 2854.88]  Whatever, I forget.
[2855.68 --> 2856.38]  So the reason...
[2856.38 --> 2856.90]  A very watery junk?
[2856.98 --> 2860.04]  I'll say radio compatibility is actually one factor.
[2860.04 --> 2868.16]  But Samsung could probably figure out how to support more bands with their chipset if they really...
[2868.16 --> 2868.76]  Pretty sure that would be fine.
[2868.76 --> 2869.78]  ...wanted to hard enough.
[2872.24 --> 2872.68]  Nuanced.
[2872.98 --> 2873.40]  Nuanced.
[2873.52 --> 2873.98]  Thank you.
[2874.06 --> 2874.42]  That's the one.
[2874.42 --> 2875.12]  No, that was the chat.
[2875.22 --> 2875.52]  Good job, chat.
[2875.52 --> 2876.18]  Oh, thank you, chat.
[2876.26 --> 2876.62]  Nuanced.
[2876.72 --> 2877.10]  I just...
[2877.10 --> 2877.66]  I read it in chat.
[2877.70 --> 2878.28]  I was like, absolutely.
[2878.28 --> 2880.90]  So there are business reasons for doing it.
[2881.08 --> 2895.14]  So first of all, within Samsung's different business units, like for example, their fabrication unit that also, as you guys probably know, builds RAM or NAND Flash or even processors for competitors.
[2895.92 --> 2907.20]  Within Samsung's different business units, I have it on fairly good authority that Samsung Unit A won't actually get a discount compared to the open market from Samsung Unit B.
[2907.20 --> 2916.84]  So if Samsung Mobile wants to buy NAND Flash for their phones for storage, they don't get like a discount compared to if Apple were buying it.
[2917.02 --> 2930.46]  It's all down to that business unit, the fabrication business unit, needing to make the best profits they can and negotiating deals based on volume, based on capacity, based on all the things that they would normally do.
[2930.88 --> 2936.44]  So there's one reason why Samsung Mobile might not be married to Exynos chips.
[2936.44 --> 2942.56]  Reason number two is that building a CPU is really hard.
[2943.44 --> 2944.54]  Every time.
[2945.18 --> 2946.42]  Look at Snapdragon 810.
[2946.78 --> 2957.76]  Even Qualcomm, who has been, other than Apple, basically the undisputed leader for a lot of the last few years, can really screw it up sometimes.
[2957.76 --> 2967.78]  So if Samsung were to just say, haha, for our Note and S lineup, we are not going to use your top tier chips.
[2967.78 --> 2971.84]  We're going to stop marketing Qualcomm technology being good.
[2972.16 --> 2976.86]  We're going to burn this bridge because we can make our own CPUs.
[2976.86 --> 2993.52]  If Samsung were to do that and then flub up a generation or two generations of chips, they could put their Galaxy S or Note products at a significant disadvantage compared to the LGs and HTCs of the world.
[2993.70 --> 3000.60]  Guys who didn't invest in that fabrication technology but also aren't taking that risk.
[3000.60 --> 3012.34]  Samsung is dual sourcing not just to make up fab capacity, which as far as we can tell is why Apple does it, also to play the different fabricators against each other.
[3012.34 --> 3015.80]  Oh yeah, that's another reason.
[3015.94 --> 3019.98]  So that they can play Samsung's own business unit against external ones.
[3021.54 --> 3022.62]  Where was I going with this?
[3023.30 --> 3025.98]  Right, so there's also a business reason for dual sourcing.
[3026.06 --> 3030.04]  Not just to make up fab capacity but also to hedge your bets.
[3030.72 --> 3036.90]  So Samsung has the ability to ramp up and do Exynos in more regions if Qualcomm ships a dud again.
[3036.90 --> 3042.24]  But they can also cover for their own dud in the event that Qualcomm's technology is significantly better.
[3042.24 --> 3042.72]  Huge one.
[3043.12 --> 3049.76]  And Samsung, they can't really, okay, I'm 100% certain they can afford it but I'm going to say in this immediate point in time.
[3049.76 --> 3052.36]  Apparently they're also legally required to use their chips in their phones.
[3052.48 --> 3053.72]  It's a 25-year-old agreement.
[3054.86 --> 3055.20]  Weird.
[3055.52 --> 3056.48]  So that's another one.
[3056.92 --> 3063.62]  But having another big launch failure would be really bad this close to their phone bombs.
[3063.62 --> 3067.52]  Remember too, Samsung could also just use Qualcomm chips in their lower end stuff.
[3067.58 --> 3070.24]  It's not like Samsung doesn't have a bazillion models of phones.
[3070.24 --> 3070.72]  Yeah.
[3070.88 --> 3074.04]  But why they might do it within a single model.
[3074.40 --> 3075.74]  There's a lot of reasons.
[3076.00 --> 3079.40]  So there's that and then there's all the other stuff that we're talking about as well.
[3081.32 --> 3082.06]  All right.
[3082.82 --> 3085.82]  Apparently also Qualcomm CDMA patent and licensing.
[3086.28 --> 3089.62]  So until CDMA goes away, they'll just basically be forced to.
[3090.08 --> 3093.68]  But with all that said, I have an Exynos Galaxy S8.
[3093.72 --> 3096.24]  It works fine in the States but it just might not work on all carriers.
[3096.24 --> 3097.28]  So it wouldn't work on Sprint.
[3098.66 --> 3099.96]  Who else is still CDMA?
[3100.36 --> 3103.04]  CDMA will be going away sometime in the next little bit.
[3103.06 --> 3104.50]  There can't be that many carriers though.
[3104.72 --> 3105.70]  I don't think it's that many.
[3105.84 --> 3107.30]  I don't know who uses CDMA still.
[3107.82 --> 3108.56]  Who in Canada?
[3110.22 --> 3111.74]  Bell did until recently.
[3111.84 --> 3113.04]  I don't know if they do anymore.
[3113.12 --> 3114.00]  They might be GSM now.
[3115.54 --> 3115.72]  Yeah.
[3115.78 --> 3118.00]  I don't pay that close attention.
[3118.40 --> 3119.12]  So AT&T.
[3119.72 --> 3120.08]  Really?
[3120.50 --> 3121.52]  They're all still using it?
[3121.58 --> 3124.10]  Sprint, Verizon, and US Cellular.
[3124.64 --> 3126.32]  I didn't know Verizon was still using CDMA.
[3126.68 --> 3128.12]  AT&T and T-Mobile are GSM.
[3130.54 --> 3131.02]  Fun.
[3131.38 --> 3132.38]  According to Google anyway.
[3133.32 --> 3136.26]  And then apparently Bell Mobility in Ontario and Quebec is still CDMA.
[3137.72 --> 3139.00]  Tell us is CDMA here.
[3139.46 --> 3139.84]  There you go.
[3140.30 --> 3140.72]  Interesting.
[3140.96 --> 3143.94]  But we don't know necessarily that they're only using it.
[3144.12 --> 3144.30]  Yeah.
[3144.30 --> 3146.34]  So, yeah.
[3146.78 --> 3153.82]  Again, I don't pay that close attention to that stuff because I'm just not that big of a cell phone nerd if I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[3154.56 --> 3155.60]  What else do we have for news?
[3155.92 --> 3157.48]  Oh, I don't know.
[3157.66 --> 3159.14]  I just got dropped out of the dock for no reason.
[3159.62 --> 3160.50]  Happens once a show.
[3162.16 --> 3163.24]  Really bad timing.
[3163.62 --> 3165.00]  I don't know why it does that.
[3165.20 --> 3165.58]  Perfect.
[3166.54 --> 3172.56]  Celebrite is now advertising they can break the security of iOS 11, including the iPhone 10.
[3172.56 --> 3173.90]  For pretty cheap, too.
[3173.90 --> 3175.44]  Original article is from Forbes.
[3176.78 --> 3180.00]  They do have to have the phone physically in their possession.
[3180.26 --> 3180.46]  Yep.
[3180.64 --> 3181.94]  So, you'd have to ship it to them.
[3182.28 --> 3186.08]  And apparently it can cost as little as $1,500 per unlock.
[3186.44 --> 3186.68]  Wow.
[3186.68 --> 3188.66]  Their service can determine or disable.
[3189.04 --> 3190.12]  Determine or disable.
[3190.26 --> 3191.88]  That's a big difference, actually.
[3192.36 --> 3201.64]  Because determining if you get someone's phone temporarily when they lost it and you ship it off and get their pin and then get it back and get whatever you want and then be like, oh, my God, I found your phone.
[3202.44 --> 3203.36]  Yeah, not great.
[3203.36 --> 3211.70]  Yeah, they can determine or disable the pin, pattern, password screen locks, or passcodes on the latest Apple iOS and Google Android devices.
[3212.62 --> 3213.22]  Yeah.
[3213.54 --> 3213.88]  Brutal.
[3213.88 --> 3225.74]  So, we have to take this with a grain of salt because Celebrite's business is breaking security of devices for forensic data analysis.
[3225.74 --> 3229.92]  So, you know, they might just be looking for some free press.
[3229.92 --> 3238.20]  But it seems like it would be sort of a bad move to put out something that's designed to get you a bunch of free press.
[3238.20 --> 3241.12]  And then anytime anyone contacts you about it, you can't actually do it.
[3241.20 --> 3241.38]  Yeah.
[3244.74 --> 3246.60]  So, they haven't even publicly announced it.
[3246.68 --> 3249.08]  But apparently they're advertising the capability to their customers.
[3249.20 --> 3250.30]  So, that sounds pretty credible.
[3250.62 --> 3250.78]  Yeah.
[3250.78 --> 3257.32]  It can determine or disable the pin, the pattern, the password screen locks, or passcodes on the latest devices.
[3257.68 --> 3258.12]  Wow.
[3259.12 --> 3259.52]  Wow.
[3260.12 --> 3260.64]  Wow.
[3261.64 --> 3262.40]  Pretty brutal.
[3262.72 --> 3263.78]  Not a fan of this, really.
[3263.78 --> 3266.70]  That's pretty much it, actually.
[3266.84 --> 3269.64]  Is there, like, anything else that happened this week that, like, is super important?
[3271.14 --> 3275.06]  We don't have anything else in the dock because James has been busy on a really cool project.
[3275.52 --> 3276.60]  Have you even seen this yet?
[3276.72 --> 3276.90]  No.
[3276.98 --> 3278.36]  Like, you're so out of touch these days.
[3278.60 --> 3278.92]  Wow.
[3279.02 --> 3280.56]  So, we built, um...
[3280.56 --> 3281.22]  Well, James built...
[3281.22 --> 3281.74]  You lost to your son.
[3283.04 --> 3283.80]  In tennis.
[3286.78 --> 3287.14]  Huh.
[3287.90 --> 3288.56]  You know what?
[3288.96 --> 3289.58]  I'll tell you what.
[3289.66 --> 3290.40]  Why don't we play?
[3290.54 --> 3290.98]  I'll play you.
[3291.02 --> 3291.44]  I'll lose.
[3291.54 --> 3292.06]  But I'm down.
[3292.26 --> 3292.58]  I'm down.
[3292.70 --> 3293.14]  It's always fun.
[3293.26 --> 3293.48]  Fine.
[3293.48 --> 3295.22]  I'll get wrecked, but it sounds entertaining.
[3295.34 --> 3296.32]  Anyway, it's a cool project.
[3296.60 --> 3302.46]  So, I was kind of inspired by, um, the tape deck that we have in our house for some reason.
[3303.02 --> 3307.56]  And, you know how you used to be you pressed, like, a physical button.
[3307.82 --> 3311.20]  Like, a mechanical button to kind of, uh, to switch things.
[3311.36 --> 3311.66]  Yeah, yeah.
[3311.76 --> 3313.66]  So, I was like, you know what would be really cool?
[3313.90 --> 3320.28]  A gaming setup where you've got, like, a tactile button for switching between your different devices.
[3321.70 --> 3322.50]  Different devices?
[3322.50 --> 3323.06]  Yeah.
[3323.06 --> 3323.08]  Yeah.
[3323.74 --> 3327.20]  So, because, you know, PC gaming is not the only kind of gaming.
[3327.20 --> 3327.30]  Okay.
[3327.50 --> 3328.02]  Yeah, I got you.
[3328.06 --> 3329.68]  So, James and Anthony collaborated.
[3329.82 --> 3332.38]  We didn't actually end up with as cool buttons as I'd hoped.
[3332.60 --> 3335.00]  They're, like, vandal-resistant switches, unfortunately.
[3335.00 --> 3340.12]  But, but what is cool is that I wanted to work, like, an RGB element into it.
[3340.46 --> 3341.80]  So, they built a desk.
[3341.96 --> 3345.84]  Not quite scratch built, but, like, used the IKEA desk builder, then modified it quite heavily.
[3346.06 --> 3350.00]  That has a bunch of circuitry in the top, including an Arduino.
[3350.00 --> 3351.00]  You know.
[3351.00 --> 3354.26]  Um, and an HDMI switcher.
[3354.26 --> 3363.96]  So, that what you can do is there's three RGB color-coded lights on the front for the three gaming systems that are in shelves.
[3364.08 --> 3364.32]  Okay.
[3364.46 --> 3366.46]  Working their way down, along, down one side.
[3366.58 --> 3366.72]  Yeah.
[3366.72 --> 3369.62]  And then when you, so when you press the red one, it does the top.
[3370.08 --> 3375.38]  And then the RGB lighting in the drawer illuminates, and the input switches on your monitor.
[3375.54 --> 3377.48]  This legit sounds like a sellable thing.
[3377.48 --> 3378.42]  So, you're on your PC.
[3378.66 --> 3378.98]  Thing.
[3379.48 --> 3381.26]  Then, you press the second button.
[3381.62 --> 3384.64]  The RGB lighting illuminates matching the button.
[3385.08 --> 3385.72]  The middle one.
[3385.92 --> 3387.00]  And you switch to your Xbox.
[3387.80 --> 3390.10]  Press the third one, you switch to your PlayStation 4 Pro.
[3390.34 --> 3391.08]  That's really cool.
[3391.28 --> 3392.00]  Pretty cool, right?
[3392.00 --> 3394.04]  You guys should figure out how to sell this as a kit.
[3394.04 --> 3396.86]  Uh, it's kind of janky still.
[3397.18 --> 3403.00]  It would require significant further development to make it ready for prime time.
[3403.20 --> 3404.08]  That'd be so cool, though.
[3404.26 --> 3405.78]  But, you know, we, okay.
[3406.02 --> 3410.38]  So, we know a lot of other guys out there have been doing, like, setups for a while.
[3410.70 --> 3410.86]  Yeah.
[3410.92 --> 3414.30]  And so, for us, you know, we, we've had some ideas for setups.
[3414.44 --> 3415.88]  Like, you saw the projector one, right?
[3416.28 --> 3417.94]  With the projector built into the desk.
[3417.96 --> 3418.44]  That was very cool.
[3418.44 --> 3418.64]  Yeah.
[3418.78 --> 3423.60]  So, we've had some ideas for setups, but, like, we really wanted to find a way to make sure that what we're doing is different.
[3423.60 --> 3425.06]  From what anyone else is doing.
[3425.58 --> 3430.36]  So, that was where the idea of projector built into your desk.
[3430.66 --> 3436.26]  Or, like, a physical button to switch inputs between your different gaming systems came from.
[3436.64 --> 3438.00]  And I really like it.
[3438.04 --> 3440.06]  I think this is something that we're going to continue to do.
[3440.48 --> 3443.82]  And, you know, I'd love to see people's ideas if you want to post them on the forum.
[3443.92 --> 3445.52]  I am actually fairly active over there.
[3445.70 --> 3445.84]  Yeah.
[3445.84 --> 3447.32]  I don't post a lot, but I do read a lot.
[3447.54 --> 3447.68]  Yeah.
[3448.58 --> 3448.94]  Yeah.
[3449.60 --> 3449.96]  Yeah.
[3449.96 --> 3451.08]  I really, I'm really happy with it.
[3452.94 --> 3453.54]  All right.
[3453.60 --> 3455.00]  So, I think that's pretty much it.
[3456.62 --> 3457.02]  Cool.
[3457.10 --> 3458.90]  We have a ton of people.
[3460.24 --> 3460.64]  Viewing.
[3461.06 --> 3461.38]  No.
[3461.54 --> 3461.74]  Yeah.
[3461.78 --> 3462.28]  Viewing, too.
[3462.32 --> 3463.58]  We've got, like, 6,000 viewers.
[3463.68 --> 3465.26]  And then we've got a bunch of people cheering.
[3465.26 --> 3468.26]  Oh, this is a new thing.
[3468.84 --> 3469.24]  Oh.
[3469.58 --> 3469.84]  Yeah.
[3470.08 --> 3473.84]  So, it used to just show the top cheer, like, ever.
[3474.16 --> 3474.42]  Yeah.
[3474.52 --> 3476.94]  Now, it shows the weekly top cheerers.
[3477.10 --> 3479.06]  And it, like, totals their cheers.
[3479.38 --> 3485.04]  So, like, this dude, I'm a broke dude who's hilariously number one cheerer right now.
[3485.38 --> 3486.68]  That's why you're broke.
[3486.92 --> 3487.14]  Yeah.
[3487.32 --> 3488.30]  Then maybe you stop that.
[3488.70 --> 3493.76]  If he talks in chat, if any of these top three talk in chat, they have a little medal next to the name.
[3493.76 --> 3495.02]  And his will show a one.
[3495.14 --> 3496.30]  His will show a two and be silver.
[3496.44 --> 3497.98]  His will show a three and be bronze.
[3498.18 --> 3499.52]  And then the one guy's is gold.
[3499.88 --> 3500.34]  Got it.
[3500.38 --> 3500.74]  Okay.
[3501.44 --> 3501.72]  Neat.
[3501.98 --> 3503.16]  It's a new thing.
[3503.22 --> 3504.26]  Oh, apparently there was Switch.
[3504.28 --> 3504.58]  See, there.
[3504.70 --> 3504.86]  There.
[3505.00 --> 3505.18]  Look.
[3505.54 --> 3506.38]  Oh, I'm a broke dude.
[3506.48 --> 3508.48]  And it shows one right next to him on a gold medal.
[3508.50 --> 3508.72]  Oh.
[3508.88 --> 3509.26]  Oh, no.
[3509.30 --> 3510.10]  There was other news.
[3510.46 --> 3514.12]  The Xbox One X and the Xbox One S are getting 1440p support.
[3515.98 --> 3516.74]  So, that's dope.
[3518.70 --> 3519.02]  What?
[3519.34 --> 3519.54]  Yeah.
[3519.54 --> 3520.22]  Wouldn't that already be there?
[3520.54 --> 3520.76]  No.
[3521.06 --> 3522.40]  They supported 1080 in 4K.
[3522.78 --> 3523.28]  Oh, interesting.
[3523.28 --> 3526.86]  So, now if you don't care about 4K, which you probably shouldn't because you're gaming on a TV.
[3528.08 --> 3529.40]  Oh, so you can tell it.
[3529.58 --> 3529.94]  Oh.
[3530.00 --> 3530.40]  Yeah.
[3530.52 --> 3530.76]  Okay.
[3530.88 --> 3531.02]  Okay.
[3531.16 --> 3531.28]  Okay.
[3531.28 --> 3531.74]  Cool, right?
[3531.78 --> 3532.44]  I see what you mean now.
[3532.48 --> 3533.30]  That's very cool, actually.
[3533.36 --> 3533.50]  Yeah.
[3533.70 --> 3533.90]  Okay.
[3534.16 --> 3535.22]  I'm totally on board now.
[3535.38 --> 3535.70]  Apparently.
[3535.82 --> 3536.72]  At first, I was like, what the heck?
[3536.96 --> 3538.50]  Apparently, there was Nintendo Switch news.
[3538.98 --> 3539.78]  I don't know what it was.
[3540.20 --> 3540.40]  What?
[3540.90 --> 3541.26]  Uh.
[3541.46 --> 3541.90]  Uh.
[3542.26 --> 3542.70]  Uh.
[3542.70 --> 3543.10]  Uh.
[3543.10 --> 3543.62]  Uh.
[3543.74 --> 3544.26]  No, I don't know.
[3544.50 --> 3544.86]  Diablo's coming to Switch.
[3544.86 --> 3545.16]  Oh, okay.
[3545.28 --> 3546.72]  You can use a PlayStation 4 controller.
[3546.88 --> 3549.44]  That's an article that I saw earlier that I thought was kind of neat.
[3549.44 --> 3553.26]  Anyway, I think the One S and the One X supporting 1440p is a way bigger deal.
[3553.58 --> 3559.00]  Because if you use a console at, like, in a dorm or whatever, you probably don't have a 4K TV.
[3559.32 --> 3560.64]  You probably don't have a TV at all.
[3560.84 --> 3565.96]  You probably have your desk, which, if you're smart, has, like, a big monitor.
[3565.96 --> 3569.00]  So you can use that as a monitor and as a TV, if you're smart and you're a baller.
[3569.30 --> 3572.50]  Although, they're not that expensive these days, especially, like, compared to a TV.
[3572.78 --> 3579.10]  Anyway, the point is, a big monitor will probably be 1440p if you don't want to spend a whole bunch of money for 4K.
[3579.82 --> 3581.20]  And if you get, like, one of those Korean ones...
[3581.20 --> 3588.10]  If my university experience was anything, if there's big screens in dorms at all, they're probably TVs and they're probably real old.
[3588.58 --> 3588.80]  Right.
[3588.90 --> 3589.12]  Okay.
[3589.52 --> 3590.24]  So, fine.
[3590.24 --> 3595.04]  If you're a baller student, you can get one of those Korean 1440p monitors on eBay.
[3595.70 --> 3600.66]  You can hook that up to your PC and now to your Xbox and you can get better image quality.
[3600.90 --> 3602.30]  We know about the GitHub thing.
[3602.60 --> 3606.00]  GitHub got nailed by a massive DDoS and they recovered real quick.
[3606.12 --> 3606.72]  Good job, GitHub.
[3606.98 --> 3607.40]  There we go.
[3607.94 --> 3608.08]  Yeah.
[3608.12 --> 3609.02]  It was huge, though.
[3609.24 --> 3610.88]  It's a gigantic DDoS.
[3611.70 --> 3613.30]  But, yeah, they recovered quite quickly.
[3613.72 --> 3614.64]  Good job, GitHub.
[3615.06 --> 3616.02]  See you again next week.
[3616.10 --> 3617.28]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3617.66 --> 3617.88]  Bye.
[3617.88 --> 3618.00]  Bye.
[3618.00 --> 3618.44]  Bye.
[3618.44 --> 3618.50]  Bye.
[3628.88 --> 3633.30]  Slow-mo from Retrinus is like, yeah, we're already past the 300.
[3633.82 --> 3636.44]  So, yeah.
[3638.02 --> 3639.42]  The biggest DDoS.
[3641.66 --> 3643.20]  The greatest DDoS.
[3644.88 --> 3645.46]  No, no.
[3645.52 --> 3646.94]  That's just someone's one speaking Twitch chat.
[3646.94 --> 3648.42]  I was just reading their comment.
[3648.64 --> 3649.06]  Oh, okay.
[3651.36 --> 3653.48]  We have the best DDoS.
