[0.00 --> 9.60]  all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to the when show we're technically here get this out
[9.60 --> 17.50]  of my face yeah no i want it in my face put it in my face i was like what you're not letting me
[17.50 --> 23.62]  remove it once you put it in my face you gotta leave it there um at least for a little while
[23.62 --> 30.08]  for a little while let me savor it all right so we've got a great show for you guys today i think
[30.08 --> 35.18]  i actually have no idea it's been it's been off to a pretty rough start to be perfectly honest with
[35.18 --> 40.58]  you i can't even check if i wanted to yeah luke's got an update that's sitting at 23 thank you dual
[40.58 --> 47.48]  core laptops yeah i am so glad that as of eighth gen you're gone forever yes did someone someone
[47.48 --> 52.18]  raised your chair again do you want to when people like when people come on when show they need to
[52.18 --> 59.68]  just not dink around with anything or did they not that's it well why is it framed like this did
[59.68 --> 66.78]  someone mess with mine you know what forget it who cares uh maybe your chair is too low counter
[66.78 --> 72.26]  right co-creator suspended after being arrested for child exploitation um well my head's getting
[72.26 --> 81.86]  cut yeah i know well like mine too now let's just uh uh i'm calling max i'm summoning max i'm summoning
[81.86 --> 87.64]  max beautiful show the best show um okay no further details yet other than the other details
[87.64 --> 92.88]  that we have that we'll tell you about later uh amd suggests that mining may be profitable on thread
[92.88 --> 93.18]  ripper
[93.18 --> 99.98]  i don't even i have i don't even laughing because i like know that it isn't or that it is
[99.98 --> 107.22]  it's just like please miners buy our stuff too buy more of our stuff miners yeah you're making us so
[107.22 --> 113.92]  much money please um all right elon musk uh released a flamethrower yeah what is it called
[113.92 --> 120.56]  the boring company yeah all right so we'll talk about that later i guess yeah and apple sells fewer
[120.56 --> 129.64]  iphones but profits rise wow this is some boring boring stuff i'm so interested in apple making lots of
[129.64 --> 132.34]  money we'll find out other things to talk about i guess shink
[132.34 --> 141.44]  so i had you lower it max but i think what ultimately happened was someone adjusted my chair height
[141.44 --> 146.44]  because luke's and my head was supposed to be at about the same height because we're maintaining
[146.44 --> 150.68]  the illusion that i'm not homunculus so um
[150.68 --> 154.48]  i'm trying to didn't even phase at all
[154.48 --> 157.94]  no one's fooled we can't see it
[157.94 --> 162.48]  no i do not want an apple box to sit on what are you brandon
[162.48 --> 167.78]  no no no bad new brandon
[167.78 --> 173.24]  why just slouch a bit
[173.24 --> 181.64]  terrible welcome to the land show oh man is this update still at 28 28 it's gonna go like the
[181.64 --> 185.82]  whole show you're not even gonna have a laptop for the show today this is ridiculous bring it up
[185.82 --> 194.20]  on my phone oh man you know what i would i would even say it's been that kind of week
[194.20 --> 200.74]  but it actually hasn't it's been an okay week i actually had an okay week yeah well you know no
[200.74 --> 205.34]  wait hold on a second i forgot about all the drama at the beginning of the week what with the oh
[205.34 --> 213.40]  yeah you know about you had some right i was a late comer okay because i i had no idea i had no
[213.40 --> 217.20]  idea it was happening while it was happening yeah but then i was like just cruising through float
[217.20 --> 221.54]  plane to make sure everything was going good and i saw like you were like what a mess where'd
[221.54 --> 226.04]  this come from well no i saw like that thread and i was like i'm confused and then i watched like
[226.04 --> 230.50]  two minutes of it and was like i don't have time for this and i don't care and then i scrolled down
[230.50 --> 237.04]  and was like most of the comments don't seem to care oh oh on our site on our site yes yeah and
[237.04 --> 242.48]  then i heard about the tweet and then i was like whoa and then i moved on yeah it totally blew up um
[242.48 --> 247.08]  a lot of people have sort of asked me for comments but i've oh i've said pretty much everything
[247.08 --> 251.50]  no no it's that's the scheduled shutdown i've said pretty much everything i have to say in an
[251.50 --> 258.30]  unlisted live stream that you should have gotten four notifications about i was so mad like it's so
[258.30 --> 264.58]  mad okay i have a 15 megabit up connection at home i am i've watched that part down the hall from a
[264.58 --> 269.70]  thousand dollar access point which those of you have been watching a long time know that i used to
[269.70 --> 276.80]  have a lot of issues with wi-fi so eventually finally just like about three years ago i was
[276.80 --> 283.26]  like i am so done with this like what gives me more satisfaction in my daily life another graphics
[283.26 --> 291.46]  card for sli no or wi-fi that works all the time i think i'm gonna do by the way i think i might do
[291.46 --> 296.92]  another wtf is going on with sli video really because i think it almost needs an update because
[296.92 --> 303.68]  it's actually changed that much it's like neither of them want to support it amd's like no completely
[303.68 --> 311.14]  nvidia's like sort of too other than that no nvidia likes people putting two graphics cards in their
[311.14 --> 317.98]  system honestly i think for them it's less even about the money and more about just like that a gpu is a
[317.98 --> 327.32]  status symbol yeah um but the the game developer support is basically non-existent and before the
[327.32 --> 332.60]  i don't know why we're talking about this i guess there's no good topic so we might as well um before
[332.60 --> 338.48]  the mentality from the the hardware guys seemed to be that they just show up to your development
[338.48 --> 345.02]  studio before your game came out and be like no you now support sli and crossfire and then now they
[345.02 --> 350.66]  just don't and because they're not there isn't support for it i don't know it's it's been a
[350.66 --> 356.42]  terrible experience like assassin's creed origins if you ran with sli enabled the game would run it
[356.42 --> 361.48]  would just run way worse than it would have ran otherwise which is like completely not the experience
[361.48 --> 366.80]  that you should have i don't know it's been it's been it's been rough for the multiple graphics card
[366.80 --> 372.50]  guys and the future doesn't look any better at all yeah so i don't remember where we how we got
[372.50 --> 378.92]  onto this topic uh you were talking about this the you preferring having like a sweet ap versus a
[378.92 --> 383.56]  sweet grab yeah so i decided that wi-fi was actually more important to me than a few frames per second
[383.56 --> 389.98]  so i got a baller access point so i was streaming through the youtube app on a pixel 2 excel so i was
[389.98 --> 395.20]  as google as i could possibly be and i sent out i managed the interesting part i managed to send out
[395.20 --> 401.70]  three notifications to people each time i went live which three each time no no one each time
[401.70 --> 408.36]  three one for each time i went live and then the streams would just stop i got a i got a screen grab
[408.36 --> 413.56]  of uh actually you know what i like unhappy face i can probably grab it but yeah like um
[413.56 --> 420.48]  it would just give me this error and be like yep your stream is down
[420.48 --> 431.28]  um and it doesn't seem to have uploaded to that's my thumbnail i know yeah because just the the i i
[431.28 --> 436.00]  couldn't eye roll enough i actually tried to eye roll more that was the most that was the most that
[436.00 --> 442.10]  i could physically roll my eyes um but i just got this your stream has failed message and and it would
[442.10 --> 449.68]  just stop and then what i've discovered now is that you can't you have no way of undoing those
[449.68 --> 454.02]  notifications that are sitting in people's feeds so i was getting messages from people for the next
[454.02 --> 460.02]  couple days like they'd screenshot these four notifications in a row they'd be like wtf is this
[460.02 --> 463.72]  and i'm just kind of sitting here going i'm sorry i can't reply to every single one of you
[463.72 --> 470.00]  i don't like it either trust me it's dumb but i i can't do anything about it so i finally
[470.00 --> 476.40]  streamed on the iphone 10 instead and it worked perfectly that's like something like if you're if
[476.40 --> 481.24]  you're twitch streaming and say obs crashes or your computer blue screens or something and you need to
[481.24 --> 486.12]  go twitch stream again yeah it sends the email version of the notification to everyone i disabled
[486.12 --> 492.10]  the auto tweet one because of that on like most like ours doesn't do it mine doesn't do it i most
[492.10 --> 496.76]  people that i help it doesn't do it anymore yeah but it will still email everyone and people still
[496.76 --> 502.28]  get the phone notification right so it's pretty yeah it's pretty frustrating like it would be nice
[502.28 --> 507.70]  to have it you know be resumable or something like if they especially because the app itself didn't crash
[507.70 --> 516.02]  it was just like your stream is stopped we'll start it again and i understand i do understand that
[516.02 --> 523.38]  whether it's down to uh you know codecs requiring files to be closed out or whether it's down to any
[523.38 --> 529.58]  number of reasons that it's actually not like trivially simple i do get that but there has to
[529.58 --> 535.14]  be a better system than what we have now especially if you stream for like one minute and then you stream
[535.14 --> 540.42]  again like i would i would i would like for it to be a little bit smarter than that um so anyway i said
[540.42 --> 543.54]  pretty much everything i had to say there you guys can check that out if you want you probably have a
[543.54 --> 551.52]  notification if you're subscribed but um in a nutshell people were mad because i confused a tampon and a pad
[551.52 --> 557.42]  because the title said tampon okay and the thumbnail is holding a pad i don't know we probably shouldn't
[557.42 --> 562.50]  get into it i just i just don't understand um yeah we we probably shouldn't we probably shouldn't get
[562.50 --> 569.68]  into it because all we stand to do yeah all we stand to gain is more articles on mashable daily mail
[569.68 --> 575.24]  really and some yeah oh yeah like there are there are like articles about about this controversy
[575.24 --> 581.42]  that i'm kind of sitting here going okay like i guess i guess that's a thing that we need to
[581.42 --> 588.76]  write about today okay um i'm just gonna not comment let's move on yep so i don't i don't even want to
[588.76 --> 594.22]  cover this first topic either what's the first topic today the counter-strike thing oh yeah there's
[594.22 --> 600.14]  not really a lot to say well no it specifically says was not charged yeah crime so i don't really
[600.14 --> 604.50]  want to cover it because we're just like throwing this dude under the bus when he wasn't charged with a
[604.50 --> 609.44]  crime maybe if anything concrete comes out of it yeah i don't like the idea of just throwing his
[609.44 --> 618.82]  name under the bus when he's not uh arrested suspended by valve um yeah it's a suspension
[618.82 --> 624.52]  they're probably waiting till they okay statement from valve suspended from the developer while the
[624.52 --> 629.72]  company investigates does not have a criminal history so in a nutshell we're not going to name
[629.72 --> 633.74]  any names it doesn't look like anything's really happened here but one of the co-creators of
[633.74 --> 641.24]  counter-strike uh has been arrested and suspended from valve and uh there's what's weird is that
[641.24 --> 649.94]  he's been arrested but not charged with a crime and the police didn't say if an actual child was harmed
[649.94 --> 658.00]  he has no criminal history and of course the local news station is speculating as to you know what this
[658.00 --> 665.74]  might mean um but no one has actually indicated that uh they know exactly what's going on here so let's move into
[665.74 --> 671.90]  oh man why would amd even bring this up
[671.90 --> 679.72]  so this article from pcgamesn.com what does this mean for amd's reputation that's an interesting thing
[679.72 --> 687.62]  for me because so many gamers right now are really upset about lack of stock of parts about prices of
[687.62 --> 696.60]  things going up and the person or the group that everyone loves to hate is theoretically fighting
[696.60 --> 702.14]  against it at least in statement i don't know outside of that yeah but nvidia has stated at least
[702.14 --> 706.18]  i don't again i don't know outside of that they might be doing something i don't know if they are or not
[706.18 --> 711.60]  um that they that they are trying or they want gamers to still be able to buy graphics cards and
[711.60 --> 716.08]  stuff amd i don't think has stated anything about graphics cards as far as i know i could be ignorant
[716.08 --> 721.66]  on that topic it's not like my laptop's working right now um this might take several minutes yeah
[721.66 --> 727.64]  you bet it will but but is actively encouraging people to buy cpus for mining so they're trying to
[727.64 --> 732.08]  potentially crush the other side of the market and right now with everyone being mad at like
[732.08 --> 738.32]  what is it micro center or something i don't know because they're like bundling gpus with
[738.32 --> 741.84]  whole platforms but if you buy the whole platform you get the gpu at msrp
[741.84 --> 750.44]  okay sure but like if you don't you get it at a cranked up price right yeah that makes sense so it
[750.44 --> 754.64]  makes it tough for upgraders but that's but then upgraders are a huge part of the market because
[754.64 --> 762.66]  yeah you don't have to upgrade your cpu that often yeah so anyway the what what leads up what
[762.66 --> 766.78]  leads you know we should probably straw poll this but what led us to this conversation is that amd's
[766.78 --> 773.44]  technical marketing manager damian trillett believes that there's massive potential for home mining rigs
[773.44 --> 778.32]  with their thread ripper cpus and there's a few details here let's go through the like stuff that
[778.32 --> 781.86]  was said first and then we'll get into all the problems with this because there are some
[781.86 --> 787.22]  um so kryptonite can be mined with cpus that have about two megs of level three cash per mining
[787.22 --> 792.82]  thread level three cash is important for cpu mining yeah uh so this rules out almost all asic
[792.82 --> 798.02]  mining machines that are so far in production but favors cpus with high level three cash per core
[798.02 --> 804.90]  which thread ripper is designed for okay so we also said uh cpus could be acceptable for mining if
[804.90 --> 808.76]  they could handle very few threads very fast and that's exactly what thread ripper is able to do
[808.76 --> 814.44]  thread ripper comes with up to 32 megs of level three cash and it can keep the data set in cash
[814.44 --> 820.28]  which speeds up crypto mining a lot blah blah blah so with two megs per thread a thread ripper 1950x
[820.28 --> 827.08]  could run around 15 active mining threads not bad uh that would allow it to get in about the same
[827.08 --> 833.24]  ballpark as rx vega and it will be much faster for example this is all quoting them much faster than a
[833.24 --> 840.12]  1080ti for example in kryptonite uh intel's hdt chips have far less level three cash per core
[841.24 --> 846.92]  so um he believes that a thread ripper could be capable of accumulating around 90 a month through
[846.92 --> 852.28]  the nice hash mining program though of course uh let me just check my handy dandy how much has the
[852.84 --> 860.60]  market fallen yeah um uh you know calculator here and it's dropped honestly this is not reflective of
[860.60 --> 864.20]  what happened yesterday so it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of like 30 plus percent
[864.20 --> 873.32]  in the last couple of days um doop doop doop doop so your mileage may vary now of course um it could
[873.32 --> 879.00]  also go back up or it could go down 80 percent more i heard something happened last january as well so
[879.00 --> 883.08]  there could be a seasonal i'm pretty sure it's every january yeah there could be a seasonal element to this
[883.08 --> 888.92]  but um or there might not be who knows maybe every other january was just a coincidence and maybe this one
[888.92 --> 898.28]  is too or maybe this is the end of times who knows the end of mining um anyway so using his estimated
[898.28 --> 904.92]  earnings a threadripper 1920x would see a return beyond its own msrp of around 760 in just under nine
[904.92 --> 916.52]  months so oh yeah i'm not reading james you have to do it you do it is amd trying to cash in on that
[916.52 --> 927.64]  cryptocurrency c-a-c-h-e terrible okay so so funny problem number one is the perception problem yeah
[928.28 --> 934.44]  do you i think that's huge because you look at how many people were mad about the piece that we did
[934.44 --> 939.16]  on cryptocurrency mining what was it a week ago two weeks ago something like that did you check out
[939.16 --> 944.20]  mining adventure part two part three yeah uh part two the one with the gpus i've seen all of them okay
[944.20 --> 949.56]  you've seen all of them so mining adventure part two well roughly i'll skip through it we covered um
[951.00 --> 959.32]  building a more optimized gpu mining machine and that got 40 000 likes which is pretty good wow but
[959.32 --> 967.00]  also 10 000 dislikes yeah because the gamers so just over a fifth of you guys were mad enough that on a
[967.00 --> 973.64]  piece of content that i thought was pretty good whether you like mining or not i thought it was interesting
[974.20 --> 979.72]  um jake did a lot of research on this one we ended up with a pretty cool rig pretty optimized
[979.72 --> 987.32]  configuration anyway people were so mad that we got a fifth of you like pressing the dislike button to
[987.32 --> 993.32]  show your dissatisfaction with us even covering this stuff and there's 8 000 comments on it 8 000 i don't
[993.32 --> 997.16]  know who they should be mad at well okay i know at least one group that they should be mad at outside of
[997.16 --> 1001.96]  that i don't know if they should or should not be mad at other groups yeah uh but gamers i understand
[1001.96 --> 1006.52]  the gpu market is terrible right now yeah it's crazy i would not want to be building a computer i
[1006.52 --> 1012.28]  wouldn't build a computer i tweeted out like way before the whole internet made articles about it and
[1012.28 --> 1015.72]  then some people were like oh they copied you it's like no they didn't but whatever i still
[1015.72 --> 1020.44]  sure they figured it out independently yeah yeah it's a pretty common thought but buying consoles right now
[1020.44 --> 1027.40]  yeah yeah it's like actually if you just want a game a pretty decent idea it's like not a bad bet
[1027.40 --> 1032.84]  yeah and the crazy thing is you look at how quickly this happened oh because if you go back to mining
[1032.84 --> 1040.52]  adventure part one which it was fine back by many accounts or by or by a lot of accounts is a worse video
[1040.52 --> 1049.24]  yeah because we we did not try to build something optimized we actually went at it from a completely
[1049.24 --> 1053.88]  unoptimized way it's amazing by the way how's the point it's amazing how many comments there are on
[1053.88 --> 1057.96]  that video about how poorly optimized the build is that was the point even though we said it right in
[1057.96 --> 1064.76]  the video that that was what exactly what we were doing it's amazing how many people try really really
[1064.76 --> 1075.72]  hard to not understand a video anyway um so that had 50 000 likes and just 1600 dislikes that's about 97
[1075.72 --> 1080.92]  percent and then this one's closer to 80 so the whole public perception was like this is okay and
[1080.92 --> 1086.76]  then this is suddenly not okay so that's again it makes sense from mid-november to mid-january
[1087.72 --> 1093.56]  two months and the perception changed that much around gpu mining well it went from like
[1095.08 --> 1100.84]  where i think is a good spot for it to be which is like oh gamers you can like make some more money
[1100.84 --> 1105.00]  doing this yeah and like if you if you have a couple gpus around or you want an excuse to play
[1105.00 --> 1111.16]  with hardware and buy some more graphics cards you can do this it went from that to like i'm getting a
[1111.16 --> 1118.28]  warehouse and then people got really upset about that right okay the solution linus coin
[1120.20 --> 1124.76]  did you see jake's tweet no he's saying instead of float coin we should call it sink coin
[1124.76 --> 1133.24]  saint coin sink sink because the market's sinking and because of it's sink coin because you should
[1133.24 --> 1140.04]  sink your investment into it all of it literally all of it yeah so so i think we've pretty much
[1140.04 --> 1145.00]  decided we have kind of talked about it a little bit to be clear when luke initially brought it up
[1145.00 --> 1152.60]  total joke in paul's video yeah yeah not a thing we had even talked about no at all pure trollage i still
[1152.60 --> 1158.60]  don't want to call it float coin pure trollage no we don't have to okay okay um but we've talked
[1158.60 --> 1165.40]  about it we're gonna do a coin and we're gonna do it as part of mining adventure and the point that
[1165.40 --> 1171.40]  we're going to be trying to make is that and i really want you guys to listen really carefully just
[1171.40 --> 1176.92]  turn off the radio the kids don't listen to the radio anymore turn off the whatever else whatever audio
[1176.92 --> 1182.68]  noise pollution you have around you turn off the twitch streams listen really carefully we are
[1182.68 --> 1192.84]  creating this video to demonstrate how a coin can be created for purely exploitative purposes because a
[1192.84 --> 1198.28]  lot of them are because a lot of them are we will be going through the procedure and showing you guys
[1198.28 --> 1203.48]  how it is done and we'll be listing like a lot of the different ways that it could be done and then
[1203.48 --> 1209.48]  we'll be picking a few yep and we'll be going that route yep well you guys will so if you guys decide
[1209.48 --> 1216.12]  to mine it by all means mine it if you guys decide to buy some by all means do it but let me tell you
[1216.12 --> 1223.24]  guys right now our coin aside from if we can find some purpose for it where you can like use it for a
[1223.24 --> 1228.84]  voting on wanshow or voting on wanshow or like uh some kind of access to a special sub forum on the
[1228.84 --> 1234.04]  forum or whatever like we might come up with like a couple a couple lmg or float plane related things
[1234.04 --> 1239.08]  you can do with it and those would largely be a part of the experiment of getting people to use it
[1239.08 --> 1247.32]  essentially but expect it to crash because in the long term we do not have either the technical know-how
[1247.88 --> 1255.88]  or the inclination to follow this through and make it a technologically superior coin it is yeah it
[1255.88 --> 1261.72]  won't be we're gonna fork someone else's thing do do no special advancements to it yes and run
[1261.72 --> 1268.84]  forward yes so expect it to be that which is common now i realized i talked for a really long time
[1269.40 --> 1276.20]  so if anyone tuned out here's the bottom line if you didn't listen to everything i just said
[1276.92 --> 1278.60]  don't mind any and don't buy any
[1278.60 --> 1288.52]  yeah everybody got that yes yeah okay that's good uh now it's time for our sponsors hold on one quick
[1288.52 --> 1297.56]  thing if you do want to know about um cpu mining i believe i believe ufd tech has done a video on like
[1297.56 --> 1302.20]  is it worth it i don't know if we're gonna go down that road oh i actually haven't i wanted to talk about
[1302.20 --> 1306.44]  a few things to do with this okay after after these messages from our sponsors we're gonna talk about a few
[1306.44 --> 1315.08]  things from the no way what up oh these are cool it comes with swappable uh the kids ones oh okay
[1315.08 --> 1321.40]  never mind i thought it was like just purple and and for adults yeah so those those can come off easily
[1321.40 --> 1328.44]  and they bend easily and they won't break and all that kind of fun stuff all right so spectrum glasses my
[1328.44 --> 1337.48]  friends spectrum glasses are all about keeping that blue light out of your eyes staring at a monitor
[1337.48 --> 1343.16]  all day can be hard on your eyes over time and make it tougher to fall asleep so compared to a software
[1343.16 --> 1349.56]  solution spectrum gives you better filtering of blue light features include that they are stylish
[1350.20 --> 1354.44]  and you guys can check out their site they've actually got tons of different styles to choose from
[1354.44 --> 1359.32]  they're high quality they come with a one-year warranty and they have low color distortion so
[1359.32 --> 1365.16]  the idea is to block high energy blue light while keeping colors as similar as possible to be very
[1365.16 --> 1370.60]  clear you're still going to have to flip up your glasses if you wanted to do some like color accurate
[1370.60 --> 1375.00]  work but if you're reading text or working on spreadsheets or powerpoint presentations or whatever
[1375.00 --> 1380.76]  the case may be you won't be sitting there working on it with your spectrum glasses and then like you know
[1380.76 --> 1384.68]  save it and walk away and then go to present it to someone you're like oh that's supposed to be red
[1384.68 --> 1389.64]  it's orange not going to be a thing they're primarily focused on the canadian and u.s markets
[1389.64 --> 1394.44]  but they are expanding to europe oh that's cool and they offer international shipping check them out
[1394.44 --> 1402.52]  at spectrumglasses.com slash collections slash prospec or click this link and use offer code linus to save 10
[1404.68 --> 1409.32]  i'm going to copy that link into the twitch chat so you guys can go check them out and you can look
[1409.32 --> 1414.04]  almost as cool as me almost i'm wearing big headphones around my neck which makes me look
[1414.04 --> 1421.56]  super cool that was a thing for a while i know why was that a thing why i know why because of beats by
[1421.56 --> 1427.16]  dre why were those a thing why are they still a thing actually i've heard the latest ones are pretty
[1427.16 --> 1432.36]  good i haven't actually tried them i suspect apple might improve them a little bit oops there's this but
[1432.36 --> 1440.44]  you know i don't know i think apple's bar for audio is like good enough and clearly when they
[1440.44 --> 1445.48]  bought the brand it was already good enough was it well the solo twos are apparently pretty good oh
[1445.48 --> 1451.32]  i don't know tal herdsons likes them the only ones i've tried were garbage but i've only tried like one
[1451.32 --> 1456.84]  or two pairs i only tried the og ones yeah and they were awful yeah i did like the really old school
[1456.84 --> 1462.20]  black and reds right i remember i remember trying to talk one of my old colleagues at ncix out of
[1462.20 --> 1469.00]  buying them like i i did my video on them and he was like yeah so like i want to buy them but it's a
[1469.00 --> 1476.68]  lot of money they're like 400 it's a lot of money are they any good and i'm like no and he's like well
[1476.68 --> 1480.60]  i mean they look really cool and i just like i thought maybe they'd be pretty good and i was like
[1480.60 --> 1485.72]  they're not and he's like well i was just like i mean maybe they're like good enough and i'm like
[1486.36 --> 1491.80]  they're not good and you need to change the batteries like every other day so they're not
[1491.80 --> 1494.52]  good you have to change that they weren't chargeable they didn't work at all
[1496.84 --> 1503.40]  they didn't work at all without the batteries two triple a's okay yeah and he was like yeah you know
[1503.40 --> 1510.28]  what i'm just i'm gonna get them and i'm like why do i even that was the point where i realized that no
[1510.28 --> 1514.76]  matter what i say in these videos people are just gonna do whatever it is that they're gonna do
[1515.48 --> 1521.64]  like it's actually amazing how little influence that i have as an influencer yeah and on that subject
[1523.08 --> 1528.44]  squarespace yeah if you're gonna build a website please listen use squarespace okay
[1529.32 --> 1536.36]  it's really easy even i can do it you just pick one of the templates they've got eight new ones for 2018
[1536.36 --> 1541.48]  they all feature responsive design so they'll look great on any device and your site just i mean
[1541.48 --> 1545.40]  squarespace doesn't advertise this this is not one of their talking points but like your site never goes
[1545.40 --> 1551.24]  down yeah like our site has been up for like four years or whatever like i have never i don't i don't
[1551.24 --> 1556.76]  think it's ever been down nope it's amazing we've tried well we haven't like okay we've had the
[1556.76 --> 1563.48]  wandshow zerg rush it yeah yeah um it's awesome they've got 24 7 support via live chat and email and

[1594.68 --> 1600.44]  right there uh and use offer code when to save 10 someone said it's down it's not i checked lol get on
[1602.60 --> 1608.20]  freshbooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than help you create
[1608.20 --> 1613.00]  and send slick looking invoices hey this is new talking points yeah you can track your time with their
[1613.00 --> 1619.00]  timesheet function manage your expenses with their expense function and keep track of who owes you what
[1619.00 --> 1623.88]  with their who owes you what function my also has a feature to tell you when the client looks at your
[1623.88 --> 1628.76]  invoice for the first time so that if they're like oh hey yeah could you resend that i didn't get it
[1628.76 --> 1635.40]  you'd be like sure yeah let me resend that to you because realistically what what purpose doesn't serve
[1635.40 --> 1639.72]  to fight with them about it but you'll know that they look for tracking on your side you'll know in
[1639.72 --> 1643.32]  your heart of hearts if they say they didn't get it the second time then you can be like all right we need
[1643.32 --> 1648.84]  to fix this yeah um they have fully featured apps for ios and android with all of the functionality of the
[1648.84 --> 1652.60]  whole platform and it's great if you're a freelancer or a small business owner and you're looking to
[1652.60 --> 1658.36]  spend more time doing your job instead of instead of spending more time figuring out how to account
[1658.36 --> 1663.96]  for it if you have any questions their support staff you just talk to a person there's no phone tree no
[1663.96 --> 1668.12]  nothing like that and they'd be happy to help you and you can go to freshbooks.com slash when and get a
[1668.12 --> 1675.56]  free trial today enter when and how did you hear about us section huzzah all right let's go back to why cpu
[1675.56 --> 1681.40]  mining doesn't make any sense so first of all um just ask someone okay part of mining adventure
[1681.40 --> 1687.88]  should you do a like the other ways video and do like hard drive and cpu well hard drive's coming
[1687.88 --> 1693.32]  oh okay yeah that that's mining adventure side quest did you get gpu working it's not uh i haven't yet
[1693.32 --> 1697.56]  i figured it out though you just need to use a different plotter yes yeah so yeah like i just
[1697.56 --> 1702.76]  it's a yeah it's slightly more complicated than that yeah um but yes i don't care anymore because i'm
[1702.76 --> 1709.96]  using a dual 22 core system and i am getting uh up to about 70 to 80 000 ounces per minute
[1710.68 --> 1718.76]  on cpu so i have um so i have four four instances running at a time because there seems to be some
[1718.76 --> 1724.44]  kind of limitation that's capping me at 60 cpu usage so i've got four running at a time so while one of
[1724.44 --> 1728.84]  them is committing to the drive or while two of them are committing to drives the other two are running
[1728.84 --> 1733.16]  and then these ones will kick back in and then those ones will kind of run through creating
[1733.16 --> 1737.24]  nonsense and then they'll be committing them to drives and these two will be running so overnight
[1737.24 --> 1745.48]  i was actually able to do over 10 terabytes on a single rig with cpu plotting so anyway to be clear
[1745.48 --> 1750.84]  i'm not running out and buying all the hard drives put away the pitchforks um i'm just experimenting with
[1750.84 --> 1756.36]  burst coin because it's this coin that you mine by just allocating empty hard drive space to it and it
[1756.36 --> 1762.12]  doesn't seem to so in further research and actually doing it a little bit myself yeah once it's plotted
[1762.12 --> 1768.52]  yeah it doesn't seem to hurt the drive okay at all um plotting though yeah you're hitting the drive
[1768.52 --> 1774.36]  really hard rough yeah yeah like really rough so from talking to guys in the burst community they're
[1774.36 --> 1779.96]  saying that it doesn't hurt it any more than normal use would yeah so i'm still not doing it on petabyte
[1779.96 --> 1785.64]  project yeah no because i just don't even want them spinning if they don't have to be yeah um but on all
[1785.64 --> 1789.56]  these like janky drives that i had sitting in literally sitting in boxes around the warehouse
[1790.36 --> 1797.00]  why not might as well um so before i go for the weekend i'm gonna load up as many drives as i can
[1797.00 --> 1802.20]  on that system run them through all weekend and then by sort of next week i should actually have it all
[1802.20 --> 1808.76]  going so far i've made five dollars nice yeah there you go do you know how much more than that i've spent
[1808.76 --> 1817.24]  on electricity a lot i don't know exactly how much but a lot you can do dynamic plotting too are you
[1817.24 --> 1824.92]  going to do that uh no i'm actually not familiar with dynamic plotting dynamic plotting is uh you are
[1824.92 --> 1831.16]  able to use the drive oh as you add more data to it the plot will make itself smaller no i probably
[1831.16 --> 1835.56]  won't do that and you set an offset so that you have room to put stuff and then you put the stuff there
[1835.56 --> 1839.88]  and then it will shrink itself we can discuss it in the video but that's like not really the approach
[1839.88 --> 1844.52]  i'm taking you saw the machine i'm using no i know i'm just saying for for people that have like
[1844.52 --> 1848.60]  it's already getting to the point where it's probably not that practical to try to mine with
[1848.60 --> 1853.64]  just like the drive in your computer depending on the pool you join so the the difficulty so
[1854.52 --> 1861.00]  okay i'll get into this in the video but the more capacity you have the easier it is to respond to a
[1861.00 --> 1867.40]  job in time in sort of very very simple terms and so different pools do you know if that's on a per
[1867.40 --> 1879.00]  machine basis or a per address um that's a great question wonderful question no idea okay um anyway so
[1880.44 --> 1885.80]  different pools will have different thresholds for how quickly you need to be able to respond to a job
[1885.80 --> 1893.16]  in order to benefit from the pool yeah because if you're just someone with like 300 megs and you're
[1893.16 --> 1900.76]  like never never going to actually discover a coin because it's like each amount of capacity is kind of
[1900.76 --> 1905.40]  like buying more and more lottery tickets so if you just have like a tiny tiny amount you're basically
[1905.40 --> 1910.76]  just piggybacking off of the success of the big people in the pool so some pools have very strict
[1910.76 --> 1916.36]  requirements for how much capacity you have to have in order to be considered a contributing member
[1916.36 --> 1920.76]  and in order to allow you to join so what you could do is you could join one of those pools even if you
[1920.76 --> 1927.40]  have 100 megs of data but you would just never qualify and your entries would just be rejected every
[1927.40 --> 1932.36]  time you would never benefit at all hit your drive from plotting and then never and then never gain
[1932.36 --> 1938.28]  anything and then there's much much looser pools that have really really long times but those ones
[1938.28 --> 1943.80]  are full of a bunch of losers that you know no one like are individually going to find almost nothing
[1944.36 --> 1949.40]  um so anyway right now it's kind of like a weird stage where to get the most out of it you really do
[1949.40 --> 1956.04]  need a lot of drives like it's kind of transitioning that way interesting not surprised so back to cpus
[1956.68 --> 1965.40]  um so amd has made a couple fundamental errors here number one is calculating roi time roi time is a flawed calculation
[1965.40 --> 1971.00]  um because it is very easy to underestimate it or overestimate it you can't just look at how much
[1971.00 --> 1978.52]  it's bringing in today and go yes that is going to pay for itself in amount of time x because because
[1978.52 --> 1983.80]  saying it will pay for itself in amount of time x if nothing changes is just a sentence that doesn't
[1983.80 --> 1990.36]  matter yeah it will change it depends when and if you cash out um it depends what currencies you're mining
[1990.36 --> 1996.84]  etc etc etc etc etc etc it depends on whether you will even still be able to mine that particular
[1996.84 --> 2004.92]  algorithm um nine months down the road on a cpu uh so yeah depends on a lot of stuff problem number
[2004.92 --> 2011.64]  the second is that there's more to the cost of a threadripper cpu than the cost of the cpu itself
[2012.44 --> 2016.36]  so threadripper motherboards are like 300 plus dollars
[2016.36 --> 2025.24]  normal mining motherboards are in the neighborhood of 100 plus to around 200 for something like asus's
[2025.24 --> 2030.84]  b250 mining and you're going pretty hard if you go to that yeah the other issue here is that you could
[2030.84 --> 2039.00]  kind of go oh okay well threadripper is only like you know 50 so double to 50 more than a regular
[2039.00 --> 2044.92]  motherboard but you can effectively make use of the cpu socket as another mining you know
[2044.92 --> 2053.08]  uh node or whatever you want to call it as another miner except the problem with that is that threadripper
[2053.08 --> 2059.64]  is limited to what is it seven pcie devices or eight something like that yeah so you could never have
[2059.64 --> 2069.40]  a threadripper mining optimized board because you could never plug in enough gpus to account for this
[2069.40 --> 2078.28]  difference in cost so while yes theoretically you could mine on threadripper you would not do that
[2078.28 --> 2083.72]  if you were actually trying to build an optimized dedicated mining machine you might not be though
[2083.72 --> 2089.08]  if you're picking a cpu for your home rig and you want to like mine overnight it would double your roi
[2089.08 --> 2093.80]  time for one because you're not 24 7 mining but if you wanted like a beast machine cpu
[2096.20 --> 2105.16]  there's another problem um yeah yeah i'm just not sold i also wonder about the power yeah power
[2105.16 --> 2108.28]  uh it's probably not any worse than like remember they're comparing it to a vegas
[2108.28 --> 2117.72]  no i know but but but you're taking away from your roi time yeah because power is a cost so that will
[2117.72 --> 2124.12]  delay your roi time which is a screwed up thing to measure anyways i think it's a little it's borderline
[2124.12 --> 2130.84]  nefarious in my opinion for a hardware company that isn't like selling asics because then who cares
[2130.84 --> 2138.68]  anyways um to be like it'll pay for itself in nine months that's a little uh i'm not super stoked on
[2138.68 --> 2147.64]  that personally all right putting its like hash rates up and stuff is fine maybe even if they do an
[2147.64 --> 2153.96]  article on like this is why you need l3 cache yeah cpu might that makes makes a lot of sense it's like a
[2153.96 --> 2158.92]  blog post because a lot of people don't understand l3 cache anyways yep so if you're like look this is a
[2158.92 --> 2166.20]  practical application that needs a bunch of it um that would be an interesting blog post all right
[2166.20 --> 2173.80]  some random youtube channel or website or a podcast or whatever picked that up and was like oh my goodness
[2173.80 --> 2178.76]  you can mine with cpus that's fine because that's someone else doing that so you bought this yeah
[2178.76 --> 2193.00]  is this even legal here okay technically 100 yes uh-huh it actually making it here i'm gonna give it
[2193.00 --> 2199.16]  like a 50 chance uh-huh my hope is that if they reject it i can just tell them to ship it somewhere
[2199.16 --> 2205.80]  else uh-huh and then i'll just send it to my grandpa's or something and he can get rid of scorpions
[2205.80 --> 2214.68]  with it 20 000 flamethrowers fire 500 us dollars um they sold them within a couple of days yeah thanks
[2214.68 --> 2222.20]  twitch subscribers um because they took paypal here's the caption here don't do this also i want
[2222.20 --> 2226.68]  it to be clear that a flamethrower is a super terrible idea definitely don't buy one unless you
[2226.68 --> 2233.40]  like fun that's kind of lame i hadn't actually seen it fire yet that's really that's a really short
[2233.40 --> 2240.52]  yeah it's short burst okay which a lot of people were like oh that's because of laws and
[2241.96 --> 2248.44]  apparently basically nowhere has regulations on so one of the reasons why flamethrowers are not illegal
[2248.44 --> 2257.08]  in places yeah is because uh people use them as like weed destruction torches basically uh-huh and
[2257.08 --> 2261.24]  that's apparently really common in like a lot of farmland and stuff which you think oh that's gonna
[2261.24 --> 2266.12]  start a forest fire apparently no because they just like do it properly and stuff i don't know but yeah
[2266.12 --> 2273.64]  there's there's no regulations around it in canada there is not a single beep about it in the firearms act
[2273.64 --> 2278.28]  uh it's it's apparently completely allowed i even looked up import and custom stuff and there's
[2278.28 --> 2283.32]  import and custom stuff about knives because i was talking about how i like switch blades yeah
[2283.32 --> 2288.12]  switch blades and stuff and i was talking about how i like um like pocket knives on my stream once so
[2288.12 --> 2292.60]  someone sent me one and it got grabbed by customs and customs was like we're keeping this forever
[2292.60 --> 2297.16]  screw you and i was like oh okay well nothing i can do about that so i looked it up and yeah there's
[2297.16 --> 2301.56]  all the stuff about knives there's tons of stuff about guns there's ways to do it properly with both of
[2301.56 --> 2306.28]  them because stores can do it you just can't do it personally and you can let you have to set up as an
[2306.28 --> 2313.24]  entity to be able to import it and blah blah blah blah nothing for flamethrowers so theoretically
[2313.24 --> 2320.60]  it's coming atf says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 feet 10 feet is a-okay
[2321.80 --> 2327.40]  our design is max fun for least danger i'd be more scared of a steak knife
[2327.40 --> 2340.44]  this guy is such a troll yeah like he's such a troll so i want to cook with it if i don't know what type
[2340.44 --> 2346.76]  of fuel it takes so i don't know if that's possible um if it takes the right kind of fuel i want to
[2346.76 --> 2353.80]  it's like propane or something like no i think propane wait no you can with propane you can't with uh
[2353.80 --> 2359.32]  whatever tiki torch isn't no no no but tiki torches are like an oil what fuel is that okay oh yeah yeah
[2359.32 --> 2365.48]  no that's gonna be that i mean i'm not an expert but it but it looks like it could be a propane flame to
[2365.48 --> 2372.52]  me it's very blue i don't see any reason why that would not be a propane flame especially because that
[2372.52 --> 2383.40]  would make it really uh really cheap and really easy to um to refuel okay blah blah blah blah blah
[2385.48 --> 2389.96]  sale drew criticism from a california politician who said he would introduce legislation aimed at
[2389.96 --> 2394.36]  banning the flamethrowers we don't allow people to walk in off the street and purchase military
[2394.36 --> 2398.76]  grade tanks or armor piercing ammunition i cannot even begin to imagine the problems a flamethrower would
[2398.76 --> 2403.80]  cause firefighters and police officers with that said this is hardly a military grade tank or armor
[2405.88 --> 2411.00]  if you need this to start a fire this is basically a blow torch shaped like a gun
[2412.12 --> 2417.16]  like okay it's a little longer but like if you can't go to the if you can't go to the hardware
[2417.16 --> 2423.40]  store and find something that'll make a fire easier than this then i don't know man like honestly that
[2423.40 --> 2431.56]  flame has got to be that's only maybe 18 inches maybe like you can get you can get blow torches
[2431.56 --> 2437.80]  that'll do not much shy of that and probably hotter if you can jog around an office with your thing fully
[2437.80 --> 2444.12]  firing and everything's fine yeah like you could like you're saying military grade whatever military
[2444.12 --> 2449.88]  if you can run around an office shooting with a gun it's not going to be fine yeah okay i think it's
[2449.88 --> 2454.44]  hilarious so honestly now that i've seen it fire like i was disappointed i didn't order one now i
[2454.44 --> 2459.48]  don't even care it looks kind of lame i'm assuming you can mod it oh oh you figure maybe you can mod it
[2460.12 --> 2464.92]  maybe but it depends on the fuel like something like propane i doubt it yeah i don't know if it is
[2464.92 --> 2471.24]  so maybe maybe people are spamming the chat telling us what it is um canadian firearms law is so weird
[2472.20 --> 2477.72]  22 stub nose pistol nope you might hurt yourself well technically a cannon you can get in the same
[2477.72 --> 2482.04]  classification as a rifle that you would give a kid to train with canadian firearms law is such a joke
[2482.04 --> 2487.64]  it's so bad most stuff is classified by name instead of by specification so there's a lot of things that
[2487.64 --> 2493.40]  like look scary that are banned and there's things that are way scarier that don't look super scary so
[2493.40 --> 2501.72]  they're not banned it's so weird apparently tiki torches use butane someone backs me up that it looks like
[2501.72 --> 2505.72]  propane looks like propane what kind of tiki torches are we thinking then because i'm talking about those ones with
[2505.72 --> 2510.92]  like the wick and the like kind of wicker thing around it i have no idea what they take i thought they just
[2510.92 --> 2515.88]  used like uh like a wick soaked in a thing and they have like that lemon smell am i thinking of something
[2515.88 --> 2519.08]  else what is what's a tiki torch tiki torch fuel
[2523.56 --> 2531.48]  yeah no that's not that's not like uh i thought this is like a like a wax or like an oil look at the way it burns i could be wrong though
[2531.48 --> 2536.84]  tiki torch fuel like the things that we end up i don't i don't think it's a wax
[2538.44 --> 2545.64]  um something something doesn't say what america's number one torch fuel pre-fueled
[2546.28 --> 2552.60]  paradise in your backyard oh wow please just tell me what is in it thank you i wish you would just tell
[2552.60 --> 2560.68]  me what's in it oh man tiki torch fuel americansale.com with lemongrass oil oh my goodness okay
[2560.68 --> 2565.56]  well either way they have a lot of like it's scented with this or it has whatever else eucalyptus formula
[2566.76 --> 2573.80]  ah i'm dying it's kerosene kerosene kerosene all right oil keeps the bugs away yeah yeah but that's
[2573.80 --> 2579.48]  not what makes here you go no there's different kinds this is why it's hard to find paraffin tiki green
[2579.48 --> 2585.40]  whatever this is but like that's like paraffin's a wax type okay but yeah just something with a wick
[2585.40 --> 2591.88]  in it like it's totally different from from this um yeah i don't know if anyone actually knows
[2593.72 --> 2598.44]  let's see i don't think you burn citronella i think that's the yeah that's the scent crap yeah why
[2598.44 --> 2602.84]  twitch chat is spamming citronella i think that's what like makes it smell good or keeps the bugs away
[2602.84 --> 2606.84]  or something apparently the slow-mo guys did a cool video using tiki torch oil what haven't they done a
[2606.84 --> 2615.64]  cool video about that's fair yeah cool all right a lot of people saying kerosene oh finally windows
[2615.64 --> 2623.24]  10 defender is finally gonna block those shady free pc optimizer applications about time this was
[2623.24 --> 2627.96]  posted by tech dreamer on the forum and the original article is from cloud blogs dot microsoft.com
[2628.60 --> 2634.12]  protecting customers from being intimidated into making an unnecessary purchase how did this take so
[2634.12 --> 2639.80]  long i mean i'm not mad like this is like the main thing that they should have been blocking wow there
[2639.80 --> 2644.44]  was something else that i was like really mad about yeah how does you know how does windows not have a
[2644.44 --> 2651.80]  built-in screen recorder at this point outside of games how is it that ios has this and windows doesn't
[2651.80 --> 2657.08]  like there's just some baffling stuff that they haven't built in there's so okay have you heard i don't
[2657.08 --> 2662.20]  think it's in the dock but have you heard the rumors of uh the companies microsoft is interested in buying no
[2662.20 --> 2668.84]  uh oh yeah it's propane uh just go to their website 20 ounce propane there you go so there's no way
[2668.84 --> 2672.44]  you're gonna get a propane propane flame much longer than that sorry change what fuel it is
[2674.60 --> 2680.60]  yeah i don't know and we're talking like okay to be clear i think there are going to be people putting
[2680.60 --> 2686.92]  new regs in them and they're going to be people changing out the gas i don't care sure i'm not going
[2686.92 --> 2691.88]  to do it but um i i think it's going to be i'm going to go help my friend who lives on a farm clear
[2691.88 --> 2698.92]  uh blackberry bushes with it because that sounds fun right all right anyway that's what i'll do what
[2698.92 --> 2704.92]  were you saying about the uh so this is like super rumor mill stuff and to be clear i'm pretty sure if
[2704.92 --> 2710.76]  anything i think it's like insider information which is super rumor mill no no no i didn't hear this
[2710.76 --> 2716.68]  directly this is posted on some website sure okay um and it was very much like they're interested in
[2716.68 --> 2722.84]  doing this not those other companies are also okay with it sure so and one of them i'm very sure is not
[2722.84 --> 2734.84]  okay with it um but pub g corp what ea what and valve which they technically have the war chest money to
[2734.84 --> 2740.60]  deal with but like i'm sure the last one is not okay exactly they're yeah they're not okay with it
[2740.60 --> 2747.00]  pub g corp it sounds like their micro uh their minecraft acquisition yeah hey this is already
[2747.00 --> 2753.16]  popular and everyone already bought it let's now buy it to we're not really sure um but okay
[2753.16 --> 2757.72]  microtransact actually yeah part of the idea behind that sorry i just remembered was not letting it go to
[2757.72 --> 2765.88]  playstation because it's a timed microsoft xbox exclusive and i guess they're they might be trying to
[2765.88 --> 2771.80]  buy it before it can go to playstation and i heard that the idea of them acquiring ea is to get a
[2771.80 --> 2777.24]  whole bunch of exclusive can i let me cut you off right there if microsoft wanted a game studio
[2778.12 --> 2783.16]  why did they get rid of microsoft game studios where's a mic i need a mic
[2783.16 --> 2793.00]  well they're still making microsoft games because like uh whatever that new pirates game sea of thieves
[2793.00 --> 2799.08]  is like a microsoft game yeah like not much they used to be an actual major game developer yeah well
[2799.08 --> 2805.24]  i'm assuming maybe they want to get back into that i don't know okay so the ea acquisition idea is
[2805.24 --> 2811.64]  interesting because there's a lot of ways to hate that because more exclusives for xbox and stuff um but i
[2811.64 --> 2817.64]  mean everyone already hates ea pretty much at a maximum capacity already so yeah maybe they can't
[2817.64 --> 2825.00]  hate them even more i don't know maybe it's not that big of a deal i don't know um yeah i don't think
[2825.00 --> 2831.40]  any of that's going to happen i just wanted to bring up microsoft stuff um all right what else we got
[2831.40 --> 2837.16]  here it was all boring uh apple delays ios features to focus on stability that seems like a good idea
[2837.16 --> 2841.32]  couldn't use uh speaking of built-in screen recording couldn't use it today without rebooting
[2841.32 --> 2845.72]  it would list it would just go and then you could stop it and then the clip would just be gone
[2846.20 --> 2851.00]  yeah we tried a few times it was broken um for ios 12 they've been working on a redesigned home screen
[2851.00 --> 2857.72]  app grid uh hopefully by redesign they mean exactly the same except i can move stuff where i want it
[2857.72 --> 2867.00]  uh multiplayer mode for augmented reality games ah augmented reality is so bad like it is so bad
[2867.00 --> 2875.48]  we're just we're not even close we're so many years away he's okay it's bad max it's bad
[2876.84 --> 2880.68]  what can i help you with no we're streaming
[2880.68 --> 2891.64]  um uh a merger of the third party applications running on iphones and macs do i nivone told me you
[2891.64 --> 2897.96]  didn't have time after work um okay improvements to facetime um longest standing video game record
[2897.96 --> 2903.88]  was thrown out after 35 years uh this was by todd rogers it was for his dragster record yeah obviously it
[2903.88 --> 2909.00]  was impossible because it's like physically impossible to happen in the game so are a lot of
[2909.00 --> 2916.12]  his like 1400 other video game records a lot of them are physically impossible including records that
[2916.12 --> 2921.16]  are like not actually able to be gotten in the game because like your score goes up in increments that
[2921.16 --> 2926.60]  his score isn't at like a lot of the games they'll be in increments of like 10 and his score will end
[2926.60 --> 2932.12]  in like a five and it's like that it's not how that works um or he'll play donkey kong and like
[2932.12 --> 2940.44]  the next highest person is like 10 million points below him um yeah no it's super bs and uh uh where
[2940.44 --> 2947.00]  is it sorry give me one second twin galaxies records he has so many records in twin galaxies that make
[2947.00 --> 2953.64]  no sense at all um and like and they're the official source for guinness's world records and a lot of
[2954.76 --> 2961.64]  a lot a lot or all of his records were posted through one person who's now like in jail and like
[2961.64 --> 2965.80]  the tapes were seized by the police so he's like oh yeah all the tapes of my records are just gone
[2965.80 --> 2970.28]  because of that but then people have contacted the police they're like uh no we returned them all
[2970.28 --> 2977.32]  and there's like basically none um so yeah todd rog todd rogers records super bs moving on now
[2979.00 --> 2983.16]  his personal website offered a simple explanation of how he achieved his unbeatable time
[2984.20 --> 2988.44]  while maintaining that activision's certification of his time highlighted in one of the company's
[2988.44 --> 2994.04]  newsletters was enough to cement his place on the gaming leaderboards great that makes sense
[2995.00 --> 3000.04]  there's even like someone took apart a game and found that like one of the games that he played
[3000.04 --> 3005.40]  it's electronically impossible for him to get the score that he got there's another game where um
[3005.96 --> 3010.52]  i can't remember what it's called barnstorming or something like that you fly a plane and you have to
[3010.52 --> 3016.84]  fly through barns and you have to dodge other things they removed all the ops and so it when you go up
[3016.84 --> 3021.64]  and down to dodge obstacles you lose a little bit of horizontal speed so you're supposed to skim things
[3021.64 --> 3025.32]  right you're supposed to move up and down as little as possible and go straight as you can but you have
[3025.32 --> 3029.96]  to move a little bit so they removed all the obstacles from the game and just flew in a straight line and
[3029.96 --> 3037.32]  didn't even make his time so they're like dude you're bs i don't know dude's a joke it's finally being
[3037.32 --> 3043.16]  recognized that's good because there's too many cheaters in the speedrunning community and the speedrunning
[3043.16 --> 3050.36]  community is great so stop there's also a lot of really legit awesome people in the speedrunning
[3050.36 --> 3056.28]  community so there you go that aren't todd rogers so this is pretty great tivo will let users auto
[3056.28 --> 3062.84]  skip the football to watch just the super bowl commercials original article from tech crunch um
[3062.84 --> 3067.16]  in other news there's a new app that you can only use when you have five percent battery or less

[3073.48 --> 3078.60]  and there's usually about 30 people active in the chat at any given time that's hilarious um and youtube
[3078.60 --> 3086.92]  will now be labeling state-funded news broadcasts now here's a question do they label cnn and fox news
[3089.00 --> 3095.00]  are are those i don't think they're state not technically but there are people who would argue on
[3095.00 --> 3103.48]  either side that they might as well be funded by the left or the right oh geez wow wow and i think
