[0.00 --> 5.74]  about no well we're live now yeah if you want to ask me if we're talking about it then i guess
[5.74 --> 10.74]  we're pretty much talking about it no we're not no no we're not oh what what what is it
[10.74 --> 16.42]  well i can't what no you can't we're live now you can't tease me like that you can't be like
[16.42 --> 19.70]  hey are we gonna talk about and then just they're here it's embarrassing
[19.70 --> 24.46]  oh like that yeah i actually have no idea what you're talking about
[24.46 --> 35.50]  we're gonna have a great show this week yeah um it might not be the wan show
[35.50 --> 39.28]  but like somewhere someone will have a great show
[39.28 --> 49.34]  i'm looking at the show on my laptop and it looks so oversaturated
[49.34 --> 57.10]  the problem is that we're using a gaming monitor color calibration that's our issue
[57.10 --> 62.30]  that's where we're running into trouble here so we've been so first of all makes so much
[62.30 --> 68.46]  first of all our camera people came in and cranked a black magic cinema camera to 1600 iso
[68.46 --> 74.38]  so it basically in a properly lit room my shirt just looked like it looked like a bunch of like
[74.38 --> 80.14]  little bugs crawling around on my shirt um because of all the noise so much noise and then
[80.14 --> 86.46]  we tried to fix it ourselves which resulted in the visual feast in front of you today
[88.38 --> 93.18]  it's very saturated feast so that's that that's where we're at on this all right what do we what
[93.18 --> 96.86]  do we got for topics is there anything worth listening to or should people just tune out now
[96.86 --> 101.74]  uh no they should definitely stay tuned there's there's a couple things that i think will be
[101.74 --> 108.06]  relatively interesting uh the first topic i don't think is that interesting um there's there's an lg
[108.06 --> 112.46]  giveaway that we can talk about yeah you can get some lg stuff that's cool actually you can get a
[112.46 --> 118.70]  whole gaming slash workstation machine should we just do that now sure okay um so last chance to
[118.70 --> 124.22]  enter the hive mind pc giveaway sponsored by lg the winner gets a pc with an estimated value of about
[124.22 --> 131.58]  two thousand dollars depending on which parts the audience chose as a whole oh so it's like a voting
[131.58 --> 139.82]  thing okay you also get an lg 38 wk 95c monitor so it's a 38 inch 38 40 by 1600 ultra wide so we're
[139.82 --> 144.62]  looking for ideas on how to spice up the build and the stream so i will be streaming the build of it
[144.62 --> 152.06]  live that's fun and then one lucky winner will get exactly that machine so uh it's worldwide with no
[152.06 --> 158.14]  age restriction how the heck are they doing that that doesn't what that doesn't sound uh like something
[158.14 --> 163.50]  that big companies with legal departments normally do so here's a link in the twitch chat to where you
[163.50 --> 170.30]  guys can uh go check out the gleam io information about it including quebec i guess which never
[170.30 --> 180.14]  happens entries close at midnight pacific tonight june 29th so don't miss it um what else we got uh g-sync hdr
[180.14 --> 186.46]  modules at 500 to the monitor price g-sync is expensive this and more breaking news yeah i think
[186.46 --> 190.46]  we already knew g-sync normal modules were 300 bucks so the fact the price went up should not be
[190.46 --> 197.82]  super surprising um great news great news uh youtube experiments with custom thumbnails just coming in
[197.82 --> 204.06]  saving the day thank you again youtube thank you thank you youtube that was great i actually had a call
[204.06 --> 211.58]  with youtube today and like out of respect for my partner manager i won't discuss any of the like
[211.58 --> 219.10]  specifics of my call because i am very appreciative that youtube talks to me yeah because they are not
[219.10 --> 223.98]  always that communicative you'd be surprised if that's a relatively new thing yeah it's it's it's
[223.98 --> 232.94]  amazeballs um but i will say that the tone of the call on my side was very grateful i'm grateful to youtube
[232.94 --> 241.58]  and our google overlords for making our job at floatplane media easier so much easier um there's
[241.58 --> 249.34]  also rumors because you all know i love rumors of an i9 99 100k i almost wish they went just for full
[249.34 --> 257.50]  full gold and went i9 99 99k well it'll be over 9 000 that's fair um nvidia's new nda requirement to
[257.50 --> 262.78]  get access to early hardware is this a giant scandal or is it a mountain being made out of a
[262.78 --> 269.02]  molehill not even a molehill more on this at 11. it's like one speck of dirt nope nope at 11. okay
[269.58 --> 277.34]  uh nope that's it i'm rolling the intro 11. did you see this i haven't actually actually like exactly
[277.34 --> 281.50]  what i wanted to make remember i was telling you oh really it's literally it okay well we'll have to
[281.50 --> 290.86]  check that out then how do i get into the dashboard i use twitch so little and their settings menus are
[290.86 --> 295.66]  garbage where's the chat i love you twitch but your settings menus are i just want to chat oh right
[295.66 --> 297.66]  oh i forgot to whoops
[301.98 --> 307.58]  so luke doesn't technically work here but yeah you're gonna be at ltx right yeah luke will be at ltx
[307.58 --> 312.54]  because luke also technically does do things here sometimes yeah so you have a video coming soon i do
[312.54 --> 319.42]  like actually soon now and not just like me hosting a video and like pulling luke into it for like color
[319.42 --> 326.54]  commentary like luke is hosting uh the nintendo labo video the latest possible no one cares anymore
[326.54 --> 332.94]  about it but these are the reasons why people should have cared nintendo labo video that's quite a sales
[332.94 --> 340.14]  pitch all right so what basically the whole internet is wrong about labo and nintendo now you're getting
[340.14 --> 346.46]  back into the clickbait spirit i knew you had it in you yeah um so let's jump into our first topic this was posted by
[346.46 --> 357.66]  wanatology um the study of people named wan i guess wanatology over on the forum uh the original article here is
[357.66 --> 366.38]  from tech power up nvidia's g-sync hdr module is this was just working
[366.38 --> 376.54]  i you saw me test this i actually didn't but i believe you no i no you've got it on luke's
[376.54 --> 381.98]  i know but that's the one okay that was there we go all right okay did you try unplugging it and
[381.98 --> 388.30]  plugging it back in yes yes i have oh oh no never mind yeah okay you're right thanks bye okay like
[388.30 --> 395.82]  half of my calls to tech support ever really uh it's happened maybe not half i don't call tech support
[395.82 --> 401.66]  that much that's fair um but if we're going back to like when i would call tech support as a teenager
[401.66 --> 409.42]  if we're talking about ever i have definitely made my fair share of have you tried i must have told you
[409.42 --> 415.26]  my evga call story right okay you know what we're gonna get back to this g-sync hdr module have i told
[415.26 --> 420.38]  you that one before with the mineral computer i'm not actually sure i don't think so we'll get through
[420.38 --> 424.22]  part way and i'm sure there's people here that haven't heard it you'll probably remember because i i must
[424.22 --> 429.82]  have told you at some point the only time i've ever contacted customer support from any computer
[429.82 --> 435.58]  hardware company ever was evga and one time i've never had to outside of that everything's always
[435.58 --> 441.02]  worked or it's been like clearly my fault because my hand was covered in oil and i dropped a hard drive
[441.02 --> 447.18]  that is not max store that was the brand of the hard drive's fault because i it hit the ground it's my
[447.18 --> 451.90]  fault anyway took it and threw it on yeah pretty much you know where that's going i was everyone knows
[451.90 --> 455.90]  about my mineral computer if you don't uh there's there's videos of it on the channel you should
[455.90 --> 461.98]  check it out it's it's actually a really funny video in the end but yeah when i was building it
[461.98 --> 466.78]  uh i'm like 12 hours into this build and it's taken me forever it's the first time i've ever built a
[466.78 --> 471.26]  mineral computer i'm doing a lot of things for the first time it's actually only it's probably like the
[471.26 --> 475.66]  low double digits of times i've built a computer at all at this point right and i'm trying to build a
[475.66 --> 482.30]  mineral oil one um i go through a lot of hardships including realizing that due to the fish rocks that
[482.30 --> 486.54]  i put in the bottom of the fish tank my power supply would no longer fit because i did all the
[486.54 --> 492.62]  sizing based on no fish rocks being there and it was like really hard to clear a spot for it blah blah
[492.62 --> 499.50]  blah blah so i unscrewed the casing on the power supply figured out that it was like a wrapped setup so
[499.50 --> 503.66]  it was screwed on one side but it wasn't like two completely separate metal panels
[503.66 --> 511.18]  so i had to like tear off the metal that was there and i ended up only having like little
[511.74 --> 516.78]  like wire cutters so i i was able to just get a tiny little snippet and then i had to literally
[516.78 --> 523.50]  rip the metal in half i think you might be the king of wrong tools anyways i got it it that's why there's
[523.50 --> 529.42]  like a jagged edge on one part of that power luke needs a condom which you know goes to the dollar
[529.42 --> 537.74]  store finds a balloon and it's like well this end looks big enough surely the other one will stretch
[540.14 --> 541.34]  oh my god um
[543.50 --> 548.78]  but i i get the power supply ripped and it fits now and that power supply still works actually i've used
[548.78 --> 553.58]  it recently which is hilarious um it's actually pretty old i'm really surprised it still works yeah
[553.58 --> 558.30]  uh every everything fits i get all the oil in and i've turned i turned it on i did the old thing
[558.30 --> 563.42]  you turn the computer on before you put it in the case which is good yeah i did that and it worked
[563.42 --> 569.26]  fine then i submerged it pressed the power button nothing happened and i just freaked out because i'm
[569.26 --> 572.94]  a kid i don't have enough money to buy these components again right no one's going to give me
[572.94 --> 578.30]  a return on oil soaked components they sure it's not going to happen so i'm like try that sometime but
[578.30 --> 583.58]  you're sorry carry on i i have no idea what's going on i'm freaking out it's really early in
[583.58 --> 589.82]  the morning for whatever i have an evga motherboard for whatever reason i was like i'm gonna call evga
[589.82 --> 595.42]  tech support i don't know why i picked that component yeah because it could have been anything that was
[595.42 --> 601.98]  i have no idea yeah i just was like i need to call someone and the dude on the phone was like really
[601.98 --> 610.54]  calm and really patient i felt like i was calling 911 um hello computer enthusiast please state your
[610.54 --> 616.54]  emergency and i start trying to explain what's going on and like he he finally eventually i don't
[616.54 --> 622.62]  know if he's heard of mineral cooling before at this point or not but uh he's like you know what
[622.62 --> 627.90]  what i'm gonna do i'm gonna add a note to your account saying that like if we get any components in
[627.90 --> 633.82]  that have a little oil on it it's okay that was nuts he did that he actually did that and then
[633.82 --> 640.30]  he's like okay i want you to go through like taking it out and like reseeding some of the components for
[640.30 --> 645.50]  me and he stayed on the freaking line the whole time and i i put him on speaker and i reseeded a
[645.50 --> 650.94]  whole bunch of components and i put everything back in and it turned on and worked that was like
[650.94 --> 655.66]  the greatest customer support call i've ever had in my entire life and it was basically did you try
[655.66 --> 659.34]  unplugging it and plugging it back in yeah that was where we were going with this thank you that
[659.34 --> 666.62]  only took about 10 minutes but anyway that was just amazing that's that's i i almost never have
[666.62 --> 671.50]  customer support calls but that was that was really fantastic no one's come close since then
[672.14 --> 681.34]  all right so let's jump over to this g-sync news um basically uh pc pur disassembled their rg swift pg
[681.34 --> 687.74]  27 uq because those guys have balls of steel it's a two thousand dollar monitor and they found that the
[687.74 --> 693.98]  g-sync module is a newer version than the first generation g-sync monitors which i think we've known
[693.98 --> 703.34]  for like two years that new g-sync like faster g-sync was going to require a new module anyway the exact
[703.34 --> 713.50]  model of fpga is an area area anyway uh 10gx 480 which is a high performance 20 nanometer soc that
[713.50 --> 723.34]  provides enough bandwidth and lvds pins in order to process this huge 4k 144 hertz data stream it is sold
[723.34 --> 732.62]  in low quantities for two thousand dollars for the fpga alone at digikey and mouser but assuming that nvidia
[732.62 --> 739.34]  buys thousands pc pur is suggesting that the price of this chip alone will add 500 to the monitor's
[739.34 --> 747.58]  bomb cost it is further increased by the three gigabytes of ddr4 memory on the module and the
[747.58 --> 754.46]  added licensing fees for g-sync so if even just the three gigs like that stuff's expensive right now that
[754.46 --> 762.54]  stuff's really expensive right now so here's the the bizarre thing about g-sync is that from
[762.54 --> 769.26]  the consumer standpoint i know a lot of people feel very strongly that nvidia should just adopt
[769.26 --> 776.94]  adaptive sync or free sync and just kind of get on board with the rest of the industry i mean they are
[776.94 --> 784.54]  now up against more than just amd like it used to be nvidia versus amd g-sync free sync and amd had a
[784.54 --> 791.10]  handful of partners that were that were rushing free sync monitors to market um but now nvidia is up
[791.10 --> 798.06]  against a much larger tide in the industry as a whole samsung is going to be supporting free sync
[798.06 --> 805.90]  on upcoming tvs that to me is huge you combine that with the free sync support on the xbox
[806.54 --> 812.22]  and now it's like whoa whoa whoa now hold hold on just a gosh darn minute whether you have a pc or
[812.22 --> 818.70]  whether you have a console yeah if you want a game on a monitor or on a tv if you want all of those
[818.70 --> 825.98]  things and the ability to interconnect all of them free sync is the only solution on the market today
[827.66 --> 833.10]  it's probably going to stay that way and a lot of people are assuming that the only reason that nvidia
[833.10 --> 838.46]  would not adopt the industry standard solution is in order to make more money on their licensing
[838.46 --> 846.78]  but i'm kind of looking at this going like hold on a minute if there wasn't more to it than that
[847.42 --> 853.34]  why would nvidia pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 for these modules
[854.78 --> 862.62]  why would they why would they hurt the competitiveness of g-sync monitors available on the market
[862.62 --> 869.42]  if they didn't have to and then you go you go back again and you go now okay well hold on a second
[869.42 --> 879.82]  here g-sync on notebooks doesn't have this fpga so they found a way to do it with the embedded display
[879.82 --> 887.50]  port connection but not with the standard you know i think we haven't really done a guest in a long time
[887.50 --> 897.02]  i think this news merits asking tom peterson from nvidia to come on the show and explain why
[897.66 --> 905.82]  the actual ball sack they would spend all this money and lock variable refresh rate down to this
[906.46 --> 907.82]  proprietary solution
[910.30 --> 917.26]  if there isn't a compelling of their own products yeah because because imagine imagine that
[917.26 --> 927.26]  your nvidia talking to lg or tcl or samsung you're talking to a major like panel and television
[927.26 --> 936.22]  manufacturer and you're going have i got a deal for you we're gonna have you take your existing scaler
[936.94 --> 943.90]  i know it's cheap but you know you're gonna throw that away okay you're gonna take our scaler which
[943.90 --> 949.42]  doesn't have all these fancy component inputs that people might need for their legacy devices
[949.98 --> 959.34]  it doesn't take six hdmis in it's pretty basic we want you to spend 500 on it sound good
[960.62 --> 965.50]  why would they do that if they don't have to and then why would they go and put a bunch of ram on it
[965.50 --> 973.58]  if they don't have to is there okay so i've used freesync and aside from some of the
[973.58 --> 978.86]  the limitations of the early monitors where the freesync range was not very helpful like it didn't
[978.86 --> 986.62]  go down low enough i don't personally notice a huge difference like is this the kind of thing where i
[986.62 --> 990.86]  have to pull out a phantom camera in order to see the the difference in the way the monitors are
[990.86 --> 996.14]  refreshing is that something we should do we should we should talk to tom though okay if that's something
[996.14 --> 1004.86]  we should do then sure but we could get what we should do from him okay all right all right i think
[1004.86 --> 1014.22]  giving tom a chance i'm gonna email him right now uh no no i'm emailing him right now can you guys
[1014.22 --> 1021.82]  come on our show and explain g-sync this is all in the subject line got a lot of our viewers i mean
[1021.82 --> 1026.38]  really this is me asking you guys don't seem that concerned got a lot of our viewers wondering
[1027.50 --> 1035.26]  why it needs needs uh two thousand dollar fpga and three gigs of ram he's legitimately doing this
[1035.26 --> 1042.94]  right now linus you know let's throw chat seems to be asking for it right now thanks linus um okay
[1042.94 --> 1049.58]  linus yeah formal yeah you know what i'll throw in the thanks every once in a while i'll throw in the
[1049.58 --> 1054.46]  thanks it was still basically a one-liner yeah but it's got a thanks you know tom tom's tom's
[1054.46 --> 1059.50]  i respect tom a lot by the way tom's great super cool so is the other person including the email
[1059.50 --> 1065.34]  yeah yeah so if anyone can explain this to me i think our pr contact gets upset when i go straight
[1065.34 --> 1070.62]  to tom because tom is not technically pr or marketing or anything he's not technically like
[1070.62 --> 1074.62]  an outward facing position he's really good at it yeah he's like awesome yeah so it's you know i
[1074.62 --> 1081.02]  i really want to talk to tom about it because he can put something like we are spending 500
[1081.58 --> 1087.02]  for lols into a perspective that might make sense yeah because if there's anything i know about nvidia
[1087.02 --> 1089.18]  it's that they don't spend money unnecessarily
[1093.26 --> 1099.50]  all right let's jump into our next topic here uh this was posted by rubber puppy on the forum
[1099.50 --> 1105.90]  rubber and i'd like to open this with a statement from the current coo of floatplane media
[1107.02 --> 1117.26]  does floatplane media now or intend in the future to alter or um disfigure in any way the thumbnail
[1117.26 --> 1125.18]  that a creator would upload to the platform for their viewers no uh not only does that seem uh
[1125.18 --> 1131.18]  uh i'm trying to be pr happy right here not only does that seem stupid just drop the pr happiness
[1131.18 --> 1137.90]  uh that's not pr but that that literally just sounds like unnecessary work and we have a lot of other
[1137.90 --> 1147.66]  stuff to do so let's just let's jump over to my screen not only do i not get the point but it sounds like a
[1147.66 --> 1155.10]  bunch of work here's the post from rail a large song garacia oh wow i'm not even
[1155.10 --> 1161.50]  you know forget forget that i ever tried um hello team youtube i would like to know why are
[1161.50 --> 1168.06]  not the thumbnails of the videos on my channel what happens is that all my videos had thumbnails and now
[1168.06 --> 1178.14]  they are no longer seen what a tremendous tremendous concern to have um this is good so to youtube's credit
[1178.14 --> 1184.62]  now going back to going back to being appreciative of youtube for a minute here to youtube's credit they replied
[1184.62 --> 1189.66]  yeah thank you team youtube that's actually surprising good job i'm not a super huge fan of
[1189.66 --> 1196.06]  their reply we are running a small experiment where 0.3 percent of viewers will see an auto-generated
[1196.06 --> 1202.86]  thumbnail instead of your custom thumbnail okay we're not removing the ability to create your custom
[1202.86 --> 1209.66]  thumbnail we're just not going to show it to some people we're doing this to gain insight on auto-generated
[1209.66 --> 1216.70]  thumbnails for the future something to consider too is 0.3 sounds automatically like oh absolutely
[1216.70 --> 1222.94]  tiny amount of people but it's freaking youtube so 0.3 is actually i have no idea but i'm assuming in the
[1222.94 --> 1229.58]  millions of people this is actually a lot of people it's not a lot in comparison to the entire whole of
[1229.58 --> 1232.30]  people that use youtube but it's a lot of people
[1236.46 --> 1242.62]  there's someone with like a research degree that's going after them super ham for for not doing this
[1242.62 --> 1247.74]  properly there's the comments on this twitter thread are are glorious i heard back from nvidia already
[1247.74 --> 1252.54]  they're saying it doesn't cost two thousand dollars so that's good we've we've confirmed now that they
[1252.54 --> 1259.34]  are indeed getting a volume discount which we assumed before um but uh i don't have any information
[1259.34 --> 1265.66]  other than that yeah we we knew that so i'm just i just i've replied uh saying well okay yes but uh
[1265.66 --> 1271.34]  we like we still want to know yeah so just come talk to us about g-sync dude yeah they don't even
[1271.34 --> 1276.14]  necessarily have to be that they should be happy anytime tom gets in front of people they like love
[1276.14 --> 1280.78]  nvidia more so they shouldn't yeah they shouldn't be afraid to put just come come flex your tech and we
[1280.78 --> 1284.70]  can that can be like part of it but we can talk about more things all right so there's so there's
[1284.70 --> 1291.82]  a couple things here number one i personally am of the mind that 0.3 percent is not that big of a
[1291.82 --> 1296.70]  deal even in the context of a channel that gets two million views a day which is where we're kind
[1296.70 --> 1300.70]  of sitting these days we're a little low right now so hold on per channel yeah but i mean users
[1300.70 --> 1308.06]  two million times point and that's not i don't i don't actually think views is the right way to do it
[1308.06 --> 1313.66]  okay they could be whale users but if it's no no no not a random distribution not even that because
[1313.66 --> 1318.22]  you're looking at people who it's going to come down to a choice decision and with how youtube's
[1318.22 --> 1321.58]  algorithm works right now if they don't click on your video it might not come back
[1322.86 --> 1328.38]  so you could be getting cut 0.3 of your users okay because now they're not clicking on it because
[1328.38 --> 1333.90]  it looks weird so the impact could be could be hurt yeah okay so that would be 60 000 views a day
[1333.90 --> 1339.02]  it could potentially hit us for assuming that it's just a one-time a one-time thing which is
[1339.02 --> 1345.58]  honestly not the end of the world but 60 000 people a day that might not see your video in sub boxes anymore
[1346.54 --> 1354.78]  i'm over it but i have deeper concerns i have other concerns my other concerns are to do with
[1355.90 --> 1362.70]  why are they doing research into auto-generated thumbnails if there isn't some kind of purpose to
[1362.70 --> 1369.02]  the experiment and the only purpose that i can think of to an experiment that goes hey what would
[1369.02 --> 1374.46]  happen if we just used auto-generated thumbnails instead of user-created thumbnails is that they
[1374.46 --> 1380.94]  are considering using them yeah that's the only reason to run this experiment that makes sense to my
[1380.94 --> 1387.10]  non-ai algorithmic brain and so question for you i'm gonna almost flip sides a little bit here yeah
[1388.14 --> 1392.54]  would that be that bad right now we have clickbait cancer all of our thumbnails i'm leaving that
[1392.54 --> 1397.26]  up to the audience so i've actually brought up our dashboard here and i'm gonna screen share with
[1397.26 --> 1404.22]  you guys let's go ahead and pop up my screen here all right so this video right here went up today
[1405.42 --> 1410.70]  high school for gamers uh actually this is not our original thumbnail design for it it originally had me
[1410.70 --> 1416.06]  holding up a legitimate e-sports textbook which was hilarious by the way look e-sports textbook amazing
[1416.86 --> 1420.78]  so we've got a few different options here we've got to actually do you want to do you want a straw
[1420.78 --> 1425.58]  pull create a straw pull and we just need a couple options do you prefer our custom one or do you
[1425.58 --> 1431.90]  prefer one of the auto-generated thumbnails so this is high school for gamers we've got me standing
[1431.90 --> 1436.94]  holding a book in front of a plant we've got me standing in sort of a dark room it's hard to see my
[1436.94 --> 1441.82]  face and then we've got me standing outside of a building and then we've got sort of bigger me with
[1441.82 --> 1446.38]  people gaming behind me okay so there's example number one we're gonna we're gonna do a few we're
[1446.38 --> 1449.90]  gonna do a few here uh here let's try this one
[1453.74 --> 1459.58]  this laptop does everything sort of we've got me holding up laptops we've got some people sitting
[1459.58 --> 1466.22]  around eating what is presumably cake we've got some people sitting at a table and we've got actually me
[1466.22 --> 1472.94]  holding laptops okay all right but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lead you guys too much i want you guys to
[1472.94 --> 1477.58]  to conclude for me uh let's try to dual cpu sockets matter
[1479.90 --> 1484.30]  this video didn't perform very well so maybe we would have been better off you know i actually don't
[1484.30 --> 1493.34]  mind this one hmm okay what i mean this one do you think do you think the top one that does suck that's
[1493.34 --> 1498.14]  like yeah that does suck uh do you think the top one is the one that it would pick though i don't
[1498.14 --> 1503.98]  know it might just be one of it might be like random um okay let's try why do we need so many
[1503.98 --> 1513.26]  servers okay this one wow we would have thought it was a tech linked episode with riley with that one
[1513.26 --> 1518.30]  so that would have been terrible yeah that's not great uh this is just me in kind of a dark mess
[1518.30 --> 1524.22]  hard to tell anything this is just me in the editing den it's hard to tell like having a picture
[1524.22 --> 1529.26]  of the server does seem pretty helpful for this one is there any other examples you want to you
[1529.26 --> 1534.06]  want to see is anything people in chat are saying that they they pick the middle thumbnail and other
[1534.06 --> 1538.14]  people are just keep on saying that it picks the second one or the second one is the best blah blah
[1538.14 --> 1544.06]  blah interesting okay all right why is everyone buying this monitor okay let's try this one sorry
[1544.06 --> 1549.82]  you guys i know this is taking a little while but this is this is live research okay so it managed to grab
[1549.82 --> 1555.98]  our end card so that's not helpful for sure it managed to grab me standing in the kitchen i am
[1555.98 --> 1560.78]  looking at a monitor though again the second one's okay though but the second one is okay it's me
[1560.78 --> 1566.54]  sitting there with a monitor in front of me uh do you have those straw poll results yeah um where will
[1566.54 --> 1571.34]  i how will i get them spamming them in chat so if you just go to chat okay cool i'm gonna go i'm
[1571.34 --> 1576.54]  gonna go check out chat i'm gonna go grab that and bring it up bam oh i missed all right click dick
[1576.54 --> 1581.98]  dang it i found actually one of the better ways to do it is to put your mouse where it will be and
[1581.98 --> 1586.94]  then wait for chat to bump it and then click there i've actually i've actually found that that works bad
[1586.94 --> 1594.86]  solutions for stupid problems okay so even though we did see some pretty good examples in there of
[1594.86 --> 1602.70]  thumbnails that actually looked not bad 80 of you are saying that you would prefer the custom creator
[1602.70 --> 1607.58]  thumbnails at least in our case and i know that there are some creators out there that are
[1607.58 --> 1614.06]  not doing a good job super abusing of of uh in good faith creating a thumbnail that is representative
[1614.06 --> 1621.98]  of the content yeah um but still an 80 to 20 percent vote here is is a pretty overwhelming majority
[1621.98 --> 1628.06]  that looks pretty clear to me that you guys have you guys have spoken someone in chat 80 of chat has bad taste
[1628.06 --> 1634.62]  well moving on then
[1637.02 --> 1641.74]  actually we should get our uh we should get our sponsors out of the way yeah um i believe one of
[1641.74 --> 1656.38]  them is ltx 2018 oh boy ltx is the oh that's weird wah wah ltx is the interactive meetup and oops meetup and
[1656.38 --> 1661.74]  interactive tech event it'll be on july 14th at the richmond olympic oval here in richmond british
[1661.74 --> 1667.42]  columbia canada current booths include a blind cable management competition brought to you by cable
[1667.42 --> 1671.82]  mod i want to do that i don't know i will take you on that's actually way more interesting a
[1671.82 --> 1679.50]  d-lidding workshop so bring your cpus we will show you how to d-lid them case toss 2.0 now with more
[1679.50 --> 1691.18]  safety multi-headed vr a lan 10k ultra wide gaming which by the way is curved i thought it was 12k it
[1691.18 --> 1701.34]  was going to be 12k but then we settled on um uh 3440 by uh 1440 ultra wides instead of the 4k ones okay
[1701.34 --> 1709.10]  and i will say that it is a better experience okay doing it this way okay the extra pixels were
[1709.10 --> 1713.90]  not contributing much and the extra size probably would have been unnecessary because it already
[1714.54 --> 1720.62]  takes up a ginormous significant port have you seen it no it's actually built oh it will be there
[1720.62 --> 1725.90]  like it's confirmed now before we were just kind of hoping corsair asus vertigir cable mod bs mods
[1725.90 --> 1730.54]  free geek alpha cool and i buy power will all be at the event with a ton of more brands sending swag
[1730.54 --> 1737.98]  and to give you guys some idea of the swag nvidia has sent six titan x's six 1080 ti's and a whole
[1737.98 --> 1742.70]  bunch of other stuff so we're actually thinking they won't sponsor us but they'll give us stuff to
[1742.70 --> 1748.54]  give away that's actually that's pretty cool sure i mean they make ltx pretty sweet yeah so far two
[1748.54 --> 1753.10]  years in a row so what we were thinking is instead of just doing a bunch of draws on the stage because
[1753.10 --> 1758.06]  that kind of took forever and was kind of tedious it did we're gonna make so many things there like
[1758.06 --> 1764.06]  competitions cool so like the blind cable management thing you might win a titan so we want to drive
[1764.06 --> 1768.94]  participation so yeah that's come hang out ticket start at 35 canadian and you can check them out at
[1768.94 --> 1776.22]  the link below or ltx expo.com there's also going to be custom merch that you can't get other places oh
[1776.22 --> 1781.42]  there's also going to be custom merch apparently that you won't be able to get other than at ltx i want
[1781.42 --> 1787.74]  so wow that's kind of a dick move so the customers that you actually can't get anywhere else is ltx merch
[1787.74 --> 1794.62]  oh it's an ltx but also oh we have lanyards too right yeah we have lanyards cool and then there's also
[1794.62 --> 1801.10]  one design that our guy has created that is going to be on sale later but you can't get it anywhere else
[1801.10 --> 1806.22]  and it's really cool and it's going to be cheaper oh it'll be cheaper at ltx okay cool and like more
[1806.22 --> 1811.90]  color varieties and stuff all right yeah also sponsoring the show today private internet access
[1812.54 --> 1817.98]  it supports a variety of vpn protocols protocols protocols and types of encryption and authentication
[1817.98 --> 1822.30]  it's got ip cloaking so you can hide your true ip address and geographic location it allows you to

[1830.86 --> 1835.42]  devices all at once on the same account and you can check it out at the link below private
[1836.54 --> 1841.82]  we need a better vanity url private internet.com pages slash linus tech tips with dashes
[1843.34 --> 1847.50]  not possible oh all right so that won't be a thing maybe we should just create our own like
[1848.22 --> 1851.82]  genius link or something we could do line sec tips.com slash pia
[1853.26 --> 1857.26]  i think i guess we could do that all right getting back into the news we actually have a
[1857.26 --> 1861.74]  a lot of topics oh what what oh no we did that we did it right at the beginning yeah
[1863.34 --> 1870.14]  bye all right so we've got some rumors to talk about this was posted by numlock21 on the forum the
[1870.14 --> 1877.02]  original article is from wccf tech and i won't say that i know anything about this because i don't which
[1877.02 --> 1882.06]  is great because it means that i can just talk about the rumors that i've heard this is probably accurate
[1882.06 --> 1892.14]  yeah there's a rumored core i9 coming to z390 um it's rumored to be an eight core processor with 16
[1892.14 --> 1898.54]  threads which is absolutely killer because for me there's a fly by the way eight core was really the
[1898.54 --> 1903.74]  threshold that i bumped into um when video encoding mind you this was a while ago it might have improved
[1903.74 --> 1910.06]  since then when video encoding with uh gpu assistance in adobe premiere and adobe media encoder okay
[1910.06 --> 1917.82]  so if i had a really high speed eight core that also had an intel integrated gpu so i could use
[1917.82 --> 1925.26]  quick sync yeah that had the potential to be the best of all worlds so you're hoping and six cores
[1925.26 --> 1933.50]  wasn't quite enough so i am really hoping that this will be uh apparently they're oh branding it core i9
[1933.50 --> 1938.54]  that's wow why are they muddying the waters why didn't they just make high-end desktop core i9
[1938.54 --> 1946.46]  and mainstream core i7 tie like what are they doing um i'm excited for mainstream to be eight core i think
[1946.46 --> 1952.30]  that'll be a really big deal yeah once mainstream has been eight core for like three years that'll be
[1952.30 --> 1958.14]  really good for software development and game development and stuff that'll be very nice i just
[1958.14 --> 1966.70]  my only thing with this is like of course i don't know well i i don't know they could have stuck with
[1966.70 --> 1971.50]  six cores i mean their six cores are actually reasonably competitive even with ryzen 2. oh i
[1971.50 --> 1977.58]  don't necessarily mean about the 9900k to be fair oh i see what you mean yeah yeah yeah like uh intel is
[1977.58 --> 1983.58]  making more processors oh i see yeah the the individual details if they're true that is
[1983.58 --> 1990.54]  interesting but it's a rumor so the rumor is that a core i7 9700k would be six core 12 thread direct
[1990.54 --> 1997.50]  replacement for the 8700k and the 9600k would be six core six thread so direct replacement for the 8600k
[1998.22 --> 2003.82]  what i would expect and this won't be popular is that because they are creating a new model number
[2003.82 --> 2008.78]  and they're giving it a core i9 designation i would expect this to be positioned as a more
[2008.78 --> 2015.02]  expensive option what we've seen over the last four or five generations now going from 2600k to 3770k
[2015.02 --> 2029.26]  to 4770k to 4790k to 5775c that was short-lived to 6700k to 7700k is every generation intel has
[2029.26 --> 2035.42]  bumped the performance by five to ten percent and they've uh put a few bucks on the price how much
[2035.42 --> 2039.18]  how much do you think it'll cost but basically not much more than adjusting for inflation
[2039.90 --> 2044.78]  i think this time we are going to see the top tier skew on the mainstream platform cost a significant
[2044.78 --> 2050.78]  amount more i wouldn't be surprised if instead of with ryzen oh yeah barking at their tails i think so
[2050.78 --> 2056.38]  i don't think that from intel's perspective ryzen challenges the mainstream k chips
[2056.38 --> 2061.02]  because their positioning of these chips is that they're for gamers even an i9 because those are
[2061.66 --> 2069.82]  crazy expensive yes and no the cheapest i9s uh core i9 let's see what would be what like an it's oh
[2072.70 --> 2081.98]  70 is there a 78 something k can't remember oh man this is a laptop chip why why do i even why do i
[2081.98 --> 2087.50]  even bother going to intel's website when there's wikipedia oh no okay yeah you're right core i9
[2087.50 --> 2092.62]  start at a thousand dollars that's that's like not really this one won't be like that though i think
[2092.62 --> 2098.06]  this one will be like a hundred dollars more okay so so from because that's a pretty big shift for them
[2098.62 --> 2103.18]  yes it kind of actually makes sense but it's a big shift yeah so i think this will be like a hundred
[2103.18 --> 2108.86]  dollars more and i think the justification will be that this is the fastest gaming chip and it's also a
[2108.86 --> 2115.90]  really versatile uh sort of cheapo workstation chip because you will get to use the cheaper
[2115.90 --> 2124.78]  consumer chipset which does save you some money yeah all right nvidia's new nda requirements for
[2124.78 --> 2130.38]  early hardware this is supposed to buy athen immortal on the forum and the original article
[2130.38 --> 2137.90]  here was from tech power up um so basically i'm glad we used the tech power up article yeah um yeah
[2137.90 --> 2144.62]  because they are pretty much they went full editorial yeah we don't basically think that
[2145.26 --> 2151.98]  that is that big of a deal um it was a so this whole situation is very awkward yeah so german
[2151.98 --> 2161.50]  tech application heist.de i don't know if i said that right probably not um they felt that this latest
[2161.50 --> 2167.82]  update suggested to them that nvidia was mandating positive reviews in order to get access to
[2167.82 --> 2173.34]  hardware they weren't tech power up disagrees i disagree i actually hadn't gotten a copy because
[2173.90 --> 2180.78]  our video contact sent it to luke who sat on it for weeks instead of hey okay the no i got a follow
[2180.78 --> 2185.90]  up a week after the deadline hey linus is anyone from your organization going to sign this i never saw
[2185.90 --> 2190.38]  and then i got your forward after i had sent the sign one back to him already i know did you if you
[2190.38 --> 2194.78]  noticed from the forward it was not a reply to the original email oh i don't think i got the two
[2194.78 --> 2200.14]  week old email okay and that email was like a day or two old at that point so anyway it wasn't that
[2200.14 --> 2207.10]  bad i read through it actually as far as ndas go it was pretty plain jane it was like two pages
[2207.74 --> 2213.58]  didn't have anything terrifying in it like there's some ndas out there that are scary like we're working
[2213.58 --> 2217.82]  on getting this really unique graphics card that actually outputs over ethernet
[2217.82 --> 2222.22]  uh yeah it's super cool their nda really cool
[2224.78 --> 2231.10]  much bigger much bigger much bigger um nvidia's was actually for a company that size in particular
[2231.10 --> 2235.02]  like we've worked with some big multinationals in the past especially on like sponsored projects
[2235.02 --> 2239.18]  and theirs should explain why it's not that big of a deal because a lot of people read it and still
[2239.18 --> 2242.78]  thought it was really bad probably because they're just not used to reading legalese or ndas
[2242.78 --> 2249.66]  well it's because the the wording that says the recipient shall use confidential information
[2249.66 --> 2258.46]  solely for the benefit of nvidia means that while the product is nda'd you are not supposed to be
[2259.26 --> 2266.70]  say for example taking this this unreleased graphics card and lending it to your buddy over at amd so that
[2266.70 --> 2270.62]  they can run benchmarks on it so that they'll know ahead of time what the performance will be
[2270.62 --> 2277.58]  when the nda that's what that means when the nda lifts the solely for the benefit of nvidia thing
[2277.58 --> 2286.62]  also lifts and besides the interpretation of solely for the benefit of nvidia could be very broadly
[2286.62 --> 2292.94]  interpreted like you could say that constructive criticism is for the benefit of nvidia that would
[2292.94 --> 2300.46]  be that would be that would be a fairly easy legal defense like it's not nearly as restrictive as as
[2300.46 --> 2306.94]  it might be made out to be and like we you know when nvidia does something wrong um like for
[2306.94 --> 2312.62]  example their uh geforce partner program and uh i don't feel like we pulled any punches on that
[2312.62 --> 2317.50]  uh luke has made his feelings on geforce experience very abundantly clear over the years
[2318.06 --> 2322.86]  um which okay i actually i will take this opportunity to add for them they've done a huge
[2322.86 --> 2327.82]  improvement oh i now use it when you when you no no i don't use it either but this is that's the
[2327.82 --> 2333.26]  point i'm talking about you know how before if you did express install it would just install i
[2333.26 --> 2337.42]  actually did notice that yeah that's actually super cool yeah so it doesn't make you install
[2337.42 --> 2341.58]  it anymore yeah thank you that's actually awesome i've hammered on them so much about geforce
[2341.58 --> 2346.94]  experience so i have to give them the positive kudos at the same time about making it so that
[2346.94 --> 2351.42]  there's now when you go to the express stall it's like express with geforce experience or express
[2351.42 --> 2356.78]  without i did notice that that's a absolutely totally acceptable good enough option we've got how
[2356.78 --> 2362.14]  about nvidia releasing 10 30s with ddr4 memory that's what you get for buying a 10 30.
[2363.74 --> 2368.94]  you don't buy low-end graphics cards we've made multiple videos about that here let's let's just
[2368.94 --> 2374.38]  low-end graphics card gamers nexus made a recent one about it too all you have to do all you have to do
[2374.38 --> 2380.30]  is google it let me google that for you technically youtube is google low-end video cards rent are they
[2380.30 --> 2385.74]  still terrible spoiler yes low-end video card rent and radeon r7 240 unboxing and review spoiler
[2385.74 --> 2395.34]  yes um most gamers nexus's video and i think it's pretty new it's about the 10 30 or whatever
[2395.34 --> 2402.54]  dang it which is probably get your get your get your freaking seo okay there you go gamers nexus
[2402.54 --> 2407.90]  disgrace of a graphics card gt 10 30 tdr4 is probably that video is probably why that person said that
[2407.90 --> 2414.14]  thing in twitch chat that is my assumption right but that's what you get for buying a 10 30 instead of a
[2414.14 --> 2422.06]  last generation 900 series decent card as far as i know 10 30s are for like the the person that walks
[2422.06 --> 2426.70]  into best buy needs to plug in more monitors and doesn't know any better because the cold hard
[2426.70 --> 2434.38]  truth and i've got i've had people just completely not listen so many times to mine and yours for that
[2434.38 --> 2440.62]  matter criticisms of low-end graphics cards saying well some people just don't have that much money to
[2440.62 --> 2446.62]  spend on a better one then buy used it's like the whole point of scrapyard wars
[2448.30 --> 2453.58]  a lot of people like we have had very good experiences with this if you bring your rig we'll
[2453.58 --> 2459.50]  let you test it just test it a lot of honestly a lot of the hardware community these these dudes will
[2459.50 --> 2465.50]  even like let you into their house to where their computer is to test it there i'm not being some kind
[2465.50 --> 2472.14]  of you know elitist you know oh well then you should just spend more on your graphics card that's
[2472.14 --> 2481.26]  not the point no the point is that brand new garbage is still garbage whereas used diamonds are still
[2481.26 --> 2487.42]  diamonds this might be a little slightly scratched up or something i'm i'm getting all mad and i shouldn't
[2487.42 --> 2493.58]  let myself get this stressed out about it it's just stupid uh someone asked when is scrapyard wars
[2493.58 --> 2502.46]  coming oh two weeks to float plane to float plane so it'll be a week after that um we had talked about
[2502.46 --> 2508.06]  float plane being more ready for prime time by the time scrapyard wars comes where are we at on that
[2508.06 --> 2515.66]  um there uh can i do a big push go sign up for float plane it's gonna be amazing scrapyard wars i'm
[2515.66 --> 2521.10]  hoping you guys ready we have some cool things coming there's obviously been some uh minor shake
[2521.10 --> 2524.78]  up as you've heard of recently so we'll have to see how we react to that but there is some cool
[2524.78 --> 2530.54]  things coming notifications are going to be working soon um some parts of it are already working oh we're
[2530.54 --> 2535.18]  not like launching that part yet until all of it's working okay uh discord integrations and stuff are
[2535.18 --> 2540.54]  gonna be working soon there's there's some really cool things coming down the pipe uh okay if we can get
[2540.54 --> 2544.78]  it done fast enough all right cool i'm excited you know what i should just i should just do it
[2545.66 --> 2553.42]  we are gonna we are gonna pimp look at the look on his face so much concern it's frozen did it
[2553.42 --> 2559.34]  freeze why is it frozen why is it frozen there's the stream oh we're back baby all right yeah um okay
[2559.34 --> 2566.78]  no i was just messing with you uh kevsky 802 i was like oh god dedicated video on the ltd channel 20 000 new
[2566.78 --> 2577.42]  users overnight are you ready no uh the original article here is from tech crunch uh and this looks
[2577.42 --> 2584.30]  pretty cool vr gloves okay luke go yes okay i've wanted this so bad linus has been playing this game
[2584.30 --> 2591.10]  what what is the game box vr box vr i train boxing in real life two times a week and i have wanted to do
[2591.10 --> 2595.66]  this box vr thing but my biggest problem with it is that i don't want to hold the controllers
[2595.66 --> 2600.78]  yeah because i think that would be really weird i'm i've gotten very used to to boxing with my
[2600.78 --> 2604.86]  boxing gloves on and uh i've been talking to i haven't had the time but i've been talking to him
[2604.86 --> 2609.90]  about how i want to get another pair of boxing gloves and mod the vive controller into the boxing
[2609.90 --> 2615.26]  glove and now these guys have more or less done it for me i'm sure i can take their design and attach
[2615.26 --> 2622.46]  to a boxing glove super easy very so that's awesome so uh in a nutshell um they're launching
[2622.46 --> 2627.66]  out of y combinator's latest class of startups with ambitions to bring a low-cost flexible glove
[2627.66 --> 2632.78]  into users hands or onto them as it were the plexus glove relies on the existing tracking systems of
[2632.78 --> 2637.18]  the htc and oculus headsets so the tracking sensors grab the position of where the hands are in space
[2637.18 --> 2642.38]  via the magnetically attached tracker magnetic that sounds bad uh yep i would just super glue it to
[2642.38 --> 2647.58]  the magnet i think yeah or better glue uh after calibrating arresting state of the user's fingers
[2647.58 --> 2652.94]  individual sensors communicate their position to the game engine very cool very cool velcro straps
[2652.94 --> 2657.10]  secure the glove at your palm and the individual finger controls hook onto the end of your fingertips
[2657.10 --> 2662.30]  with motors that offer tactile feedback see this creates a problem for modding into a boxing glove
[2662.30 --> 2666.86]  but i'll probably just ignore that part and just having gloves on and not having to wear
[2666.86 --> 2671.26]  or not having to hold the controllers will be good enough plexus is shipping the gloves with tool
[2671.26 --> 2676.86]  kits for unity and unreal game engines developer kits are 249 per pair ouch shipping in august
[2678.78 --> 2684.22]  yeah that's not cheap this is something that i've wanted for a long time believe it or not i
[2684.22 --> 2688.30]  didn't know that i wanted it to be a battle royale and in fact i probably didn't want it to be a battle
[2688.30 --> 2695.82]  royale but something that i have wanted for a long time is much much greater scale multiplayer experiences
[2695.82 --> 2701.26]  uh something that i had sort of envisioned uh a number of years ago uh what's that uh what's that
[2701.26 --> 2709.58]  game ever play savage no so savage was uh let me let me make sure this is even the right name savage game
[2711.90 --> 2713.82]  savage battle for new earth was this it
[2713.82 --> 2724.78]  i think this was it so did i ever tell you about those lands i used to run at uvic yeah with like the
[2724.78 --> 2728.94]  huge amounts of computers across multiple computer labs on multiple floors all this kind of stuff we
[2728.94 --> 2734.62]  would play savage because this game supported some crazy amount of players i don't remember the exact
[2734.62 --> 2741.90]  amount of players that it supported but we could have doesn't say labs versus labs going on oh the
[2741.90 --> 2749.50]  other one to 127 players on the team are field players yeah okay i actually didn't know this was an
[2749.50 --> 2754.86]  actual thing this is exactly what i wanted yeah so this is an old game but it's a very good like land
[2754.86 --> 2760.70]  pack you've got a huge amount of people for some reason you want to get everyone into the game and
[2760.70 --> 2765.98]  like it was always really fun because if i remember correctly this was like redstone like redstone was
[2765.98 --> 2773.90]  in this game so i had redstone in my head i think it was called redstone pre-minecraft and uh you'd
[2773.90 --> 2779.50]  have a whole lab you'd have like the the leader of that team or the leader of that lab go like we
[2779.50 --> 2784.30]  need redstone and then the whole lab is just like redstone you see everyone in the game just run over
[2784.30 --> 2789.42]  to go get it it's so much fun and you have to fight each other and you like level up and you spawn
[2789.42 --> 2795.26]  into different things and it's like this whole combat rts mix like one person each team is playing
[2795.26 --> 2801.74]  an rts game right all the other players are playing like the minions it's it's it's old it's very old
[2802.38 --> 2811.66]  interesting but it's it's fun so imagine that with like a thousand people yeah and yeah super cool so uh
[2811.66 --> 2817.66]  if anyone i i was really into supreme commander that's one of the games that i was most into out of
[2817.66 --> 2823.10]  any game like i think i was top 500 at one point which it wasn't a huge community but i was pretty
[2823.10 --> 2833.02]  good at it um imagine for a moment did you ever play subcom i did a little bit okay so it has large
[2833.02 --> 2838.14]  vehicles like i forget what they were called but they were like tier four tier four vehicles um that
[2838.14 --> 2843.34]  were like these huge things where you could potentially man something like that with like 20 or 30 people
[2843.34 --> 2851.74]  so imagine a 1000 player version of something like savage with just like kind of and the way that um
[2851.74 --> 2858.70]  subcom had a lot of really cheap swarmy type units yeah so imagine a game like that with 500
[2858.70 --> 2865.82]  b 500 with like all these different roles so you could potentially run around as a marine or you could be
[2865.82 --> 2871.98]  uh like a gunner on like this you know big land crawler tank thing or being a heli with three dudes
[2871.98 --> 2877.18]  how much of a blast it was like local voice and you like had to engage in local voice so if you're
[2877.18 --> 2884.54]  in that giant mammoth tank with 20 people you've got like the the driver like telling what's coming up
[2884.54 --> 2889.66]  telling people to like reload different sides all this kind of stuff you actually have to use like
[2889.66 --> 2895.34]  your comm system to talk to anyone that isn't nearby like this sounds like a gaming experience that
[2895.34 --> 2901.66]  would probably be too hardcore for the fortnite kids oh i'd love it though but i think it's the kind
[2901.66 --> 2907.74]  of thing that could be a completely different level of fun one thing i really really enjoyed and
[2907.74 --> 2912.22]  i know you haven't played this game but it's called it's called black wake um and i was really hoping
[2912.22 --> 2917.98]  this was what uh microsoft's pirate game was going to be like but it wasn't really but i don't even
[2917.98 --> 2923.58]  remember what microsoft's power game is called at this point um but in black wake you drop into a new
[2923.58 --> 2927.90]  game and you're on a you're on a pirate ship you're sailing in the ocean and you have to fight other
[2927.90 --> 2934.22]  people's pirate ships but your your captain like it's you're in first person view and you really
[2934.22 --> 2937.98]  can't see all that much if you're if you're the one doing things on deck right and you have to like
[2937.98 --> 2943.58]  get the gunpowder and get the the cannonball and you have to shove the gunpowder in the thing and
[2943.58 --> 2947.42]  shove the cannonball in the thing and then load the cannon and then you can aim it and fire it so
[2947.42 --> 2952.46]  like you can't look where the boat's going so the captain has to sail the boat and then like bark out
[2952.46 --> 2957.02]  like i'm lining up for this side like port side port side and everyone's trying to reload the cannons on
[2957.02 --> 2961.18]  port side the captain has to yell out like there's there's a hole below deck so it has to run below
[2961.18 --> 2966.38]  deck and try to patch it and bail the water out and all is so planet side 2 free to play massively
[2966.38 --> 2972.94]  multiplayer first person shooter um that has uh the guinness world record for the biggest first
[2972.94 --> 2979.18]  person shooter battle with 1158 players being recorded in a single battle i don't but this doesn't
[2979.18 --> 2986.70]  have the rts element yeah i don't personally think it captures the same the same idea um but it is i i've
[2986.70 --> 2991.18]  played a bit of planet side 2 it it is sort of like that but i yeah i don't think it quite captures
[2991.18 --> 2996.14]  the same idea right part of the reason for me is i believe planet side 2 is a persistent battle
[2997.50 --> 3004.70]  like forever z's it's not a match right uh i think you can win and lose areas it's an mmo yeah you can
[3004.70 --> 3009.90]  win and lose areas and like there will be a an individual battle for an individual place and if one
[3009.90 --> 3015.42]  person wins or loses then it probably ends and whatnot but it's not it's not the same type of type of thing
[3015.42 --> 3021.34]  all right let's see what else we've got for topics here oh right we didn't even talk about mavericks
[3021.34 --> 3026.22]  so mavericks promises right posted by crunchy dragon on the forum original article from pedestrian.tv
[3027.10 --> 3030.54]  earlier this year automation games revealed mavericks claiming its battle royale mode can
[3030.54 --> 3035.34]  support up to 400 players crazier yet some game modes the studio says will facilitate up to a thousand
[3035.34 --> 3041.98]  concurrent players okay persistent environment means players will leave tracks wherever they go
[3041.98 --> 3045.98]  and you'll be able to drop in and out at any time the world will continue to exist and evolve
[3045.98 --> 3051.66]  whether you're there or not neat and it'll be able to host up to a thousand players in any given server
[3052.86 --> 3057.74]  google's game streaming service may have a hardware component this was originally posted by
[3057.74 --> 3061.42]  master disaster on the forum the original article is from kotaku
[3061.42 --> 3067.26]  so basically game developers conference in march google representatives met with several big game
[3067.26 --> 3072.38]  companies to gauge interest in its streaming platform codenamed yeti and this is yet another
[3072.38 --> 3080.22]  indication that whether you like it or not cloud gaming is going to be a thing a lot of people were so mad
[3080.22 --> 3085.02]  when i did that video on what's nvidia's called again i know what you mean but yeah i don't remember off
[3085.02 --> 3091.02]  it's talking my head uh shield something what's what's it called no no it's not called grid anymore
[3092.30 --> 3102.38]  uh nvidia oh crap it's it's not called gate game no uh cloud gaming i can't remember what it's called
[3102.38 --> 3109.02]  g-force now um so a lot of people were mad they were like they're gonna have to pry my hardware from my cold dead fingers
[3109.02 --> 3115.58]  and you might be right but what's going to happen is cloud gaming is going to happen whether you like
[3115.58 --> 3122.46]  it or not and there's going to be much like um you know the xbox has gaming experiences that are simply
[3122.46 --> 3128.70]  not available on the pc there's going to be gaming experiences that are available on cloud gaming that
[3128.70 --> 3135.50]  will not be available to those of you with graphics cards in your cold dead fingers and graphics cards in
[3135.50 --> 3144.30]  pc's are also not going away anytime soon just to be very clear but i can imagine a scenario where if
[3144.30 --> 3151.34]  every player was running off of the same data center effectively you could actually enable massively
[3151.34 --> 3158.38]  multiplayer experiences more easily so the latency instead of being between the persistent environment
[3158.38 --> 3164.22]  and every individual player because you'd have effectively like zero latency within the data center
[3164.22 --> 3169.34]  would be between every player and their own connection to the persistent world i actually
[3169.34 --> 3176.54]  foresee a way to create gaming experiences that otherwise wouldn't be possible yeah that's why it
[3176.54 --> 3183.82]  will exist and i hadn't actually thought of that until i said it just now but there's nothing you can do
[3183.82 --> 3189.74]  this is happening and it also helps that massive companies like google are jumping into the fray it's not
[3189.74 --> 3195.34]  just going to be nvidia playing by themselves with some smaller startups yeah uh i don't necessarily
[3195.34 --> 3200.78]  know if i like it or not but i i do think it's going to happen it might be i i feel like it would be cool
[3200.78 --> 3207.74]  if there was like some games you know how like wow has a subscription some mmos have subscriptions you're
[3207.74 --> 3212.86]  gonna pay for a subscription anyways whatever if it's a game that makes sense to have a subscription for
[3212.86 --> 3217.90]  yeah whatever but i see it coming to the point where it's like downloading games instead of buying
[3217.90 --> 3222.38]  physical copies where like people are like oh yeah it's just easier so i'm just gonna do it anyways
[3222.38 --> 3226.54]  and then it bites people in the butt later when now they have download caps and games are 100 gigs
[3227.26 --> 3232.06]  um and other things start happening yeah not to mention that multiplayer just goes away once the
[3232.06 --> 3236.30]  game dev doesn't feel like it anymore yeah like that kind of stuff uh so google took meetings at
[3236.30 --> 3240.70]  e3 in los angeles a few weeks ago apparently the company is looking not just to woo game developers
[3240.70 --> 3245.18]  to the yeti service but to buy development studios entirely oh that's interesting oh boy
[3245.18 --> 3249.42]  whispers have been quieter around google's hardware whatever that might look like but the
[3249.42 --> 3253.90]  rumors suggest it will link up with the streaming service in some way it's not clear if they want to
[3253.90 --> 3259.18]  compete with the technical specs of like a new gen playstation or xbox or whether it'll be cheaper
[3259.18 --> 3267.82]  and low-end relying on the streaming server servers to pull their weight dun dun dun google has apparently
[3267.82 --> 3273.34]  been on a massive hiring spree bringing experienced video game developers and marketers from ea playstation
[3273.34 --> 3279.42]  and other top companies interesting uh this was posted by friendly non-murdering sort on the forum
[3281.74 --> 3286.94]  thank you for that this is super cool android messages for web now available for everyone the
[3286.94 --> 3291.34]  original article is from google.com you can use your computer to chat with your friends through messages
[3291.34 --> 3296.46]  for web which shows what's on your messages mobile app it's about time messages got some attention hey
[3297.02 --> 3301.82]  like it didn't even have cloud sync until like it just started working for me very recently i was like
[3301.82 --> 3306.06]  oh holy crap my messages are still there when i switched phones how did this take so long and
[3306.06 --> 3314.54]  just so you guys know to get it yourself oh no this isn't even the right link uh where is it
[3314.54 --> 3319.50]  uh messages for web sends sms messages using a connection from your computer to your phone so
[3319.50 --> 3326.22]  carrier fees will apply just like on the mobile app this is not like um iMessage okay it's not database
[3326.22 --> 3333.18]  still but once wow i keep forgetting what they're calling it once the new uh chat once chat rolls out
[3333.18 --> 3339.34]  i see no reason why it wouldn't be able to use data so if you go to messages.android.com it will give
[3339.34 --> 3345.02]  you the super super easy instructions on how to sync it you just click on the triple dot thing in
[3345.02 --> 3353.74]  messages it'll bring up a like a qr code reader scan it you're done um and i've used it a fair amount
[3353.74 --> 3359.18]  already because i've been coordinating a stag and people that aren't on some other messaging system
[3359.18 --> 3363.50]  to be able to write out a massive message with my keyboard and then just copy paste blop blop
[3364.38 --> 3368.86]  way easier you can pair it on multiple devices but only one will be active at a time
[3370.22 --> 3377.66]  um corsair is acquiring elgato gaming this is posted by qe colca on the forum i'm hoping that this
[3377.66 --> 3383.34]  situation is amazing because i've had a super intense frustration with them for a long time which is where
[3383.34 --> 3388.78]  they only support windows 10 on their devices right so you want corsair to go and invest heavier into
[3389.34 --> 3395.74]  wider i i doubt it but good luck what about new devices though because of course if they make like
[3395.74 --> 3403.90]  stream deck 2 or like some new capture card so my hope is actually less to do with capture and more to do
[3403.90 --> 3411.98]  with taking stream deck technology and putting it into keyboards so corsair's gaming keyboards are already
[3411.98 --> 3417.18]  pretty cool but elgato has clearly done a lot of work on remember the um the art lebedev optimus
[3417.18 --> 3421.58]  keyboard from back in the day if you guys don't know what that is look it up yeah it's pretty cool
[3421.58 --> 3426.22]  individual display on every two thousand dollar keyboard or something um so so i would love to
[3426.22 --> 3432.78]  see corsair take that technology and make it actually useful and corsair is pretty good at that
[3432.78 --> 3437.74]  make the keys more durable so that if you press on them they don't like ruin the screen below it and
[3437.74 --> 3442.70]  stuff like that stuff like that yeah that'd be really cool um even if they just did it as like
[3442.70 --> 3450.06]  a g key area yep i wouldn't even i wouldn't get your hopes up though i know what you want i know why
[3450.06 --> 3454.38]  you want it but like windows 7 is like it's done man it's done it's not even that i use it's done one
[3454.38 --> 3458.54]  but windows 7 is what i have to use for my sword for my argument because that's where the majority of
[3458.54 --> 3463.66]  users are but someone found i should have been able to find this but i i didn't but someone found
[3463.66 --> 3469.98]  that there is the like history log of versions and on one of the versions the only thing stopping at
[3469.98 --> 3475.42]  work from on windows 7 8 and 8.1 is a flag that checks if you have the right operating system so
[3475.42 --> 3480.94]  someone made a wrapper that just ignores that flag and you can just install it on whatever operating
[3480.94 --> 3485.18]  system you want and it works completely fine it doesn't have like if i remember correctly it doesn't
[3485.18 --> 3491.18]  have like twitter video integration or something and i'm like wow i don't care right so yeah i'm
[3491.18 --> 3495.34]  just gonna do that and it'll work on my computer it's fine but last topic of the day you'll probably
[3495.34 --> 3501.82]  be excited or uh apprehensive this is off news.xbox.com and it was posted by master disaster on the
[3501.82 --> 3510.22]  forum which is actually a great great username uh halo tv series set to begin filming in 2019
[3510.22 --> 3515.98]  is it live action showtime president and ceo david nevins has announced the network has ordered a 10
[3515.98 --> 3522.14]  episode season based on the halo game franchise kyle killen awake will serve as executive producer
[3522.14 --> 3527.42]  writer and showrunner rupert wyatt rise of the planet of the apes will direct multiple episodes and also
[3527.42 --> 3533.98]  executive produced the hour-long series which enters production in early 2019 okay
[3533.98 --> 3543.02]  so it is not clear to me if it is live action or animated uh it's possible that some people know
[3543.02 --> 3550.30]  that i think the a massive massive mistake was making the warcraft movie live action did you ever
[3550.30 --> 3556.54]  see it uh based on how terrible you told me it was i didn't bother okay yeah but you played warcraft
[3556.54 --> 3563.66]  you saw the amazing cinematics i played warcraft like not two yeah and not three did you not play
[3563.66 --> 3568.22]  two and three i did play two and yeah okay i just mean i was just feeling kind of old because you
[3568.22 --> 3571.10]  were like you played warcraft and i was like yes
[3573.74 --> 3579.66]  yeah i did i i played it too to be fair i played it many many many years later just to see what it was
[3579.66 --> 3586.22]  about uh it's not very good no it's actually pretty really kind of bad yeah and the ai is like super super
[3586.22 --> 3594.54]  brutal so bad but uh the the cinematics in warcraft have always been amazing yeah and yeah uh world of
[3594.54 --> 3600.94]  warcraft cinematics same idea absolutely amazing cinematics yep and then we get the movie and it's
[3600.94 --> 3607.58]  live action like they they have in my opinion possibly the best cinematics in gaming there's some argument
[3607.58 --> 3613.34]  there with square enix stuff yeah square enix has some really amazing stuff too in my opinion it's it's
[3613.34 --> 3618.30]  close or better but and it's hard to make that argument they're very different you have to go
[3618.30 --> 3624.70]  back very far and kind of compare era by era because they've both done in my opinion it's been them
[3624.70 --> 3631.18]  they've both done arguably a better job of cinematics than games at multiple points in their histories yeah
[3631.18 --> 3636.78]  sometimes it's not even arguably it's just like clearly that's way better um and so they're probably
[3636.78 --> 3642.38]  kind of depends on which one going together the whole time blizzard has been incredible at
[3642.38 --> 3648.86]  cinematics and then they make a live action movie and i just every single time that i see a warcraft
[3648.86 --> 3655.98]  or starcraft or whatever the overwatch cinematic from blizzard i'm like holy crap this is gold
[3656.62 --> 3661.10]  everything about this is perfect and then you see live action it's just what are you doing so i i hope
[3661.10 --> 3667.02]  halo is not live there's nothing here about whether it's live action or rendered uh on the xbox.com
[3667.02 --> 3672.22]  article anyway maybe people are telling us in twitch chat yeah i haven't seen any in twitch chat all
[3672.22 --> 3678.86]  right so that's pretty much it oh mickey 555 says i loved the movie and that you are a hater
[3678.86 --> 3686.94]  well you probably just don't know things about warcraft wow um and on that note uh thank you for
[3686.94 --> 3692.62]  tuning into the wan show we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel wow
[3696.46 --> 3700.30]  dang it's live action a whole bunch of people are saying it's like it's live action all right
[3700.30 --> 3702.54]  and no i didn't find my cat thank you for asking
[3705.74 --> 3707.18]  you are a straight up savage
[3711.18 --> 3714.38]  someone else replied warcraft made me want to gouge my eyes out
