[0.00 → 8.50] boom, and we're live hey all right hey welcome to the WAN show this week we have John it's been a
[8.50 → 14.20] while it has been a while I do you remember the last time no I don't I remember the audience I
[14.20 → 19.44] vaguely remember a Santa hat maybe so it's probably been a while okay but yeah that might have been
[19.44 → 25.42] the like I've done this every year when I bring each person onto the show yeah at the end
[25.42 → 29.98] well it might have been that yeah when I got stuck at the U.S. border people are saying John but
[29.98 → 35.32] they're spelling it wrong oh no someone spelled it right that happens literally every time like it
[35.32 → 39.90] happens to me on Twitter and my name is right there it's on Twitter, and they send you a message
[39.90 → 44.36] it has the at and then the correct spelling of your name and if you're on the forum you might know
[44.36 → 49.42] in my signature I say I stole my name without a h people still get it wrong, so I'm just I'm used to
[49.42 → 54.16] it by now I don't even notice it anymore yeah well that's a lie I do, but you know my problem is that
[54.16 → 60.82] I know like three different spellings of John well no one of them is Johnny I guess oh yeah okay
[60.82 → 67.96] his is like actually kind of weird for a Johnny what is because it's five letters yeah, yeah so I
[67.96 → 73.22] don't know yeah we're talking about the guy that does some of our server work here who is also my
[73.22 → 78.30] landlord funnily enough and people have seen him on camera yeah they have so yeah Johnny's Johnny's
[78.30 → 83.82] basically the nicest person on the entire planet, but he can't make it to so every single year I will get
[83.82 → 88.20] into the show in a second don't worry but every single year since I was like 15 I've been going
[88.20 → 94.08] to PAX West and I bring all my friends every time and Johnny can't make it this time and really very
[94.08 → 99.42] weird it's actually like very, very weird that he's not going to be that really is strange uh the rest
[99.42 → 103.22] of people that have been going that are going to be going are all like it's so weird that Johnny's
[103.22 → 107.44] not gonna what are we going to do I don't know I feel like he would be the straw that serves a drink
[107.44 → 112.34] so to speak so yeah, yeah so it'll be it'll be interesting, but it should be good this week we have
[112.34 → 117.12] interesting news because like Computer is happening and E3 is right around the corner and all this kind
[117.12 → 121.62] of stuff there's interesting stuff going on we don't have a lot of gaming news quite yet because
[121.62 → 129.30] I think that'll probably be next week um, but we've got Intel news an unnamed 28 core 56 thread CPU
[129.30 → 136.26] we've got news about second gen Thread ripper being on track for a Q3 2018 launch that means this
[136.26 → 141.92] year also massive changes to the Steam store we were talking about this recently on a WAN show
[141.92 → 146.84] it's going to be crazy I actually think it's super cool, but we'll talk about that later there's an
[146.84 → 155.34] obscene amount of notes on that uh AMD unveiling a 7 nanometre GPU that's insane gigabyte making fake
[155.34 → 161.92] RAM, and it's actually really cool so it's kind of like bonded leather
[161.92 → 168.74] I understand that and then actually my favourite news of this week even though it doesn't necessarily
[168.74 → 175.78] sound super cool see Sonic introducing SCMD and your cable clutter it's amazing I can't show you
[175.78 → 181.70] what it is right now I'm getting one for sureties, but we'll have to talk about that later I'm constantly
[181.70 → 186.08] kicking the cables underneath my desk in my office they won't help you with that it's like cables
[186.08 → 191.68] inside your computer, but it's super cool we'll get there later boom it worked this week is going
[191.68 → 203.24] well yes it was going well until I died I guess rip also Anthony Bourdain died yes I know very sad
[203.24 → 213.36] he was what 61 I think I don't know I liked him though that sucks fresh books LTX be there
[213.36 → 219.02] or don't but preferably be there if you can because it's cool, and I'd like to say hi also
[219.02 → 227.18] Squarespace yeah I'm going to put this back up here, and we're back boom okay that's all it takes
[227.18 → 234.32] WAN show intro completed let's move up to the top because we've got this crazy Intel processor that has
[234.32 → 238.82] some interesting news coming with it thank you by the way to vegetable stew and radiating light for
[238.82 → 244.54] sourcing this vegetable stew I see we did it there oh very clever oh yeah I'm going to post this link in
[244.54 → 249.64] me WAN doc you look like you had something to say do you I was just commenting on vegetables too
[249.64 → 254.92] although I did cover this today well James covered it, but I wrote the thing today for tech linked on
[254.92 → 259.96] this story oh, so okay yeah so do you have any interesting quips from that because you definitely
[259.96 → 264.30] know more about it than I do I have some interesting things to bring up but okay what do you think okay
[264.30 → 268.88] well without I guess without running through the bullet points first so I'll give a quick TLDR
[268.88 → 276.08] yeah, so Computer Intel shows off this 28 core 56 thread CPU, and they did this demo of it and it
[276.08 → 283.66] was like oh man the CPU is running at five gigahertz it's so cool um so after it happened um a few people
[283.66 → 291.32] noticed that there was a gigantic weird like industrial water chiller sticking out the back of the unit um I
[291.32 → 295.12] think they had it set up such that you couldn't see it straight on when they were actually doing the
[295.12 → 302.24] demo for members of the press so but that wasn't even like the worst of it they also said this chip
[302.24 → 308.38] was running at five gigahertz not telling people that it had actually in fact been overclocked so a
[308.38 → 313.52] lot of people were thinking that oh this thing is just going to run this freaking 28 chord Leon is
[313.52 → 318.26] going to run at five gigahertz out of the box which was not the case at all Intel got called out on it
[318.26 → 324.44] they had to acknowledge it, and then they ended up saying oh well they blamed it on quote unquote the
[324.44 → 328.80] excitement of the moment or something like that, and they said that their guy running the demo just
[328.80 → 334.66] forgot he forgot to say oh by the way this is not running at stock speed, so people were very
[334.66 → 340.80] understandably upset about that's so lame, but honestly I can kind of understand if it's just
[340.80 → 346.10] the demo guy that forgot to say it now if there was like press documents given out to any degree
[346.10 → 352.22] it should have it in there and the guy shouldn't forget admittedly I'm not sure if there were documents
[352.22 → 357.14] handed out, but I have no idea I think it was just whoever was running the demo said five gigahertz
[357.14 → 362.64] if I'm not saying come on man don't forget that so the processor is clocked at 2.7 gigahertz
[362.64 → 369.06] normally um and without revealing turbo speeds they haven't done they were able to overclock it to
[369.06 → 377.76] five gigahertz which is pretty crazy um the demo setup was cooled by an 850 dollar uh aquarium
[377.76 → 384.70] chiller which consumes which the chiller alone consumes 1200 watts and is meant to be able to
[384.70 → 392.54] cool a thousand litres of water so we have just found an actual use if you buy a 1600 watt power
[392.54 → 400.66] supply we finally found a real world use so you run a 400 watt computer it's a 1200 watt chiller
[400.66 → 408.64] that would be sick I'd love to see that so yeah it's its pretty cool um we'll have to see how
[408.64 → 414.96] freaking hot this thing actually gets normally um and how high you can overclock it with reasonable
[414.96 → 419.48] cooling solutions, and I'm sure Linus will be all over that once he's able to get his hands on it
[419.48 → 425.68] or if I'm reasonable like was a 480 millimetre radiator reasonable or that's fairly aggressive yeah but
[425.68 → 429.38] it's not the same it's way more reasonable than this it's better than the aquarium yeah yeah yeah
[429.38 → 435.38] like even, even like a triple red personally I would like to see a double red a double 120 or double
[435.38 → 441.24] 140 yeah that that's very if you whatever you can overclock it on that that's solid because I think
[441.24 → 444.50] that's probably where most people kind of are when they're yeah like really wanting to be an over
[444.50 → 451.68] a nice thick thick but still regular sized radiator yeah yeah all right cool with that so okay
[451.68 → 458.68] that'll be interesting next up in crazy processor news we've got a post from Alex Solo thank you very
[458.68 → 467.80] much saying that the second generation Thread ripper is on track for a Q3 2018 launch it's AMD Zeppelin
[467.80 → 472.64] silicon let me get this on screen and in the twitch chat Zeppelin so we've moved away from like earth
[472.64 → 479.94] moving material, and now we're doing blimps and awesome music mm-hmm okay
[479.94 → 489.42] book book book book book book book there we go cool 12 nanometre 3264 second gen features
[489.42 → 495.92] I know a lot of people are saying like oh it's its not it's not the most exciting processor ever
[495.92 → 503.72] I don't care is there well I'm happy that I'm mainly just stoked that they're continuing to step
[503.72 → 508.62] forward instead of abandoning for a huge section of years again well is there anything is like a most
[508.62 → 514.74] exciting processor ever any more even just with the way there's some really exciting computer hardware
[514.74 → 519.22] later on in the show I am so stoked for this you have no idea I think most of the people in chat
[519.22 → 523.36] are going to be like yawn, but I think it's amazing so don't worry about it but yeah I think this is
[523.36 → 528.06] super cool it's I think it's great that they're pushing forward again with Thread ripper going with
[528.06 → 532.60] their big heavy hitter as well bringing out another one definitely that's super cool
[532.60 → 538.84] they're not backing down it's 3264 which is sick I'm really excited about this process that's insane
[538.84 → 551.36] um 250 watt TDP boom so boom many don't even care super cool mm-hmm so not in a literal sense but
[551.36 → 559.20] yeah it's nice and warm actually uh they've they've got it displayed next to some NHS 14 s's which
[559.20 → 565.52] aren't even that huge so that's not too bad that's a beautiful looking board good job MSI
[565.52 → 577.02] I like that aesthetic that's cool that one to woo ASUS everyone has cool boards these days I like
[577.02 → 582.54] that like when I first got into computers it was like oh wow you got a board with a black PCB yeah
[582.54 → 589.10] it's just like even having a non-green like it felt like back in what like 2009 2010 it was like
[589.10 → 596.12] oh the PCB is blue buy this and that was it yeah yeah yeah, and now we have like this one has
[596.12 → 602.12] like under lighting that's RGB and like metal accents and like aggressive little thing or the IO like
[602.12 → 607.74] they look so cool now I don't know that's pretty sweet but yeah this is cool I'm very happy that uh
[607.74 → 611.10] they're they're launching another processor I know some people weren't that interested like I was
[611.10 → 616.42] saying earlier uh AMD Zeppelin silicon has eight cores and is the first generation thread ripper
[616.42 → 624.00] and the first generation thread ripper uses two of them to get the top skew of 16 cores that's written
[624.00 → 628.66] a little oddly, but hopefully that makes sense yeah um moving on
[629.66 → 638.10] yeah I think that's pretty much about it yeah uh rumours are saying August and there's no pricing yet
[638.10 → 643.42] yeah so coming up hopefully you got the dollar bills for it if you need 64 threads
[643.42 → 647.32] yeah I was going to say if you need that uh if you need that it's probably for some type of work
[647.32 → 651.40] application so hopefully it's okay I would say almost certainly for work yeah like maybe there's
[651.40 → 656.98] someone out there just really likes benchmarking just freaking loves it or like is just really
[656.98 → 663.88] really into editing home videos in like wicked quality yeah exactly like someone out there
[663.88 → 669.14] you'd have cinema level quality of my kid playing ball just spent like five figures on like a red or
[669.14 → 674.80] something and like I need yes I need to look make the driveway ball hockey yeah look like it was
[674.80 → 681.44] put together by I need to film my kids schooling the neighbour kid in hockey with a red yeah and then
[681.44 → 687.02] edit it very efficiently so when they send like the kids like hockey mistakes the junior leagues they're
[687.02 → 693.66] going to be like the production values are amazing we have to have this kid yeah 100 uh moving on to
[693.66 → 702.94] the next topic posted by matrix 07012 uh James and I where someone is yelling what the heck, so I don't
[702.94 → 709.30] know if uh twitch got to hear that but James and I were talking about this last week uh twitch took a game
[709.30 → 716.80] down where you were a school shooter wait twitch did or steam did sorry steam did okay completely
[716.80 → 721.50] I don't know I just I said twitch because I was clicking on the twitch tab, and it just like invaded
[721.50 → 728.00] my brain, but yeah steam took a game down because it was like about a school shooter uh also twitch chat
[728.00 → 735.50] apparently heard the yell so thank you apron um but yeah and my stance on that was essentially if twitch
[735.50 → 740.78] wants to do this if this is within twitch's policies why do I keep saying twitch if steam
[740.78 → 745.70] wants to do this and this is within steam's policies maybe I should just say it aggressively
[745.70 → 750.00] yeah you're turning you're actually turning red I don't like saying the wrong thing man let's go
[750.00 → 755.08] yeah you probably can't tell at home but this guy looks like a lobster right now like to
[755.08 → 763.20] me, so I have very pale skin so it shows really easy uh it's its that Scandinavia in me um but yeah I
[763.20 → 767.16] I think it's completely within their right to take it down some people were screaming for free
[767.16 → 771.10] speech and like this isn't a government platform it's its a company if they don't want to have
[771.10 → 775.96] yeah they can do basically whatever they want to with it yeah, but I also really like what
[775.96 → 781.20] they ended up doing which is saying that we don't care anymore yeah so what they're doing now is
[781.20 → 788.52] they're only removing items that are actually illegal or straight up trolling yeah quote from them so
[788.52 → 793.08] but unless it's one of those two things then the game is probably fine so yeah so
[793.08 → 796.92] like my stance on this is interesting because people there's actually a surprising amount of
[796.92 → 802.16] people that have asked me about this um because of how I run the forum and how I run flow plane
[802.16 → 809.68] because they're actually so different on the forum things get axed yeah all the time this is a tech
[809.68 → 813.20] forum stop screwing around we're going to get rid of your stuff it's a little bit it's a little bit
[813.20 → 819.08] different though because you're on the forum you have to like to keep peace between users, or it falls apart
[819.08 → 823.24] this is just a store where you if you don't want it yeah if you don't want to act interact with
[823.24 → 829.50] anyone you don't have to, and it's also like the the the centre of the topic here is supposed to be
[829.50 → 836.26] games yeah not a type of game and the centre of the thing on the forum is tech news you go it's
[836.26 → 841.78] or tech stuff in general I was thinking the tech news section but the computer stuff tech stuff gaming
[841.78 → 846.44] stuff whatnot if you're going outside that it might make sense in off-topic but if it's too far
[846.44 → 852.10] like we're not we don't want to mess with that kind of stuff this is a tech focused forum float plane
[852.10 → 859.80] on the other hand is a website for creators if you are a user, and you go on float plane, and you don't
[859.80 → 866.04] want to see a certain type of content don't give the person who makes that content your money and you
[866.04 → 871.86] won't see if it's fairly straightforward so I don't really care what people do on the platform
[871.86 → 878.50] and I don't I don't want to care I can have the stance personally where I'm like as a personal
[878.50 → 884.76] human being as Luke I don't like this content I don't necessarily hope that they do well I don't
[884.76 → 888.78] hope that they have a big audience, but I'm just going to vote with my wallet, but I'm going to
[888.78 → 894.18] facilitate their platform and be impartial because okay I am acting on behalf of a platform
[894.18 → 902.08] and I will do nothing to hinder them in any way because that would be bad were you saying that
[902.08 → 906.42] the steam store was allowing the school shooting game, or they took it down I think they took it
[906.42 → 913.84] down, but I think that was because right now they're they're going with the allow everything
[913.84 → 919.34] approach, but I believe they took it down, and I believe they're keeping it down because I'm pretty
[919.34 → 924.10] sure the guy that made it was already banned from releasing games, and he made it as a troll I'm pretty
[924.10 → 931.64] sure okay which they are reserving the right to kick off another interesting question is uh what
[931.64 → 937.74] even is a game because you can publish stuff on steam is it a game if it's a visual novel and you
[937.74 → 944.88] just click next constantly does it respect yeah does it now make it a game if there are multiple options
[944.88 → 949.94] to click next that still could be a visual novel it's just a choosy your own adventure visual novel does
[949.94 → 953.98] that make it a game does that not make it a game it's an it's an interesting conversation what's up
[953.98 → 961.08] um, so this is why this is why I've sort of been like silent for a second um because I think uh so
[961.08 → 965.48] okay here we go steam's policy change follows the platform's banning of controversial school shooting
[965.48 → 969.84] simulation game active shooter so yes you were correct so they they they took this down yeah
[969.84 → 977.36] yeah, but I think so like I think what this is saying is that they would have left it up but yeah this
[977.36 → 982.94] guy was already banned off the platform yeah they are they think he's trolling he's a notorious troll he has
[982.94 → 987.56] a record of having terrible customer service and all this other kind of stuff like there's other
[987.56 → 994.18] reasons why they wanted to take this thing down um, so I think they're leaving it down because of those
[994.18 → 1002.42] reasons gotcha uh it's its going to be an interesting time because I think this is going to spawn not that
[1002.42 → 1009.76] there isn't already, but I think it'll spawn an incredible amount more of garbage on steam there is
[1009.76 → 1015.10] already a lot of garbage because there's no law against like a bad game yeah so yeah yeah yeah I
[1015.10 → 1020.36] know I know what you mean so they have yeah they've it's its interesting and another thing that
[1020.36 → 1026.04] they were talking about is how apparently uh there was a lot of controversy in the community as to
[1026.04 → 1032.62] whether they should allow everything, or they should ban a bunch of different stuff or
[1032.62 → 1036.04] whatever there was a lot of controversy in the community right a lot of people were angry that they
[1036.04 → 1041.90] took this game down I'm not first I don't care second of all I think it's their right to do
[1041.90 → 1046.88] whatever they want is their platform and third of all they already didn't like the publisher bad
[1046.88 → 1052.18] customer service troll banned already in the past, so there are many reasons, but some people were very
[1052.18 → 1057.80] upset that they took it down some people were very uh some people think they should have taken it
[1057.80 → 1062.56] down some people think they shouldn't have basically and what valve has said is internally
[1062.56 → 1067.02] apparently they've had essentially that same war they have like the same spectrum of people
[1067.02 → 1073.56] that are outside talking about this inside the company so they've essentially decided if is the
[1073.56 → 1078.52] community is all mixed, and we're all mixed we'll kind of let the community sort it out well yeah I
[1078.52 → 1082.84] mean you talk about like a lot of trash potentially showing up on the platform, but you know this is the
[1082.84 → 1087.38] same for like the app store or this is the same for Google play there was a lot of stuff there that
[1087.38 → 1092.98] all that google or apple have done have vetted to say this does not contain malware but other than
[1092.98 → 1098.42] that there's no guarantee as to the quality of what you're buying, but the model still works especially
[1098.42 → 1102.92] on steam where I feel like it's easier to filter out stuff that you don't want to see as far as like
[1102.92 → 1107.80] recommendations or whatever I do think they'll need to do a much better job of categorizing and
[1107.80 → 1111.52] filtering things I know they do some suggestions already, but they need to amp up that system
[1111.52 → 1119.02] I know that uh they plan on making it, so there are parental controls in terms of what stuff you can
[1119.02 → 1124.80] see and what stuff you can't see obviously that's going to have to come in so like theoretically you
[1124.80 → 1132.46] wouldn't be able to see active shooter or uh a game with wives or something yeah banging simulator 2019
[1132.46 → 1138.78] uh unless you have your settings to be uh to be allowed to see those types of waif banging simulator
[1138.78 → 1147.00] it's 2019 it's yeah it's next year yeah 10% more polygons already yeah it's amazing it's the best game
[1147.00 → 1156.64] if it even is a game I don't know um moving on to my favourite thing in this show I don't know if
[1156.64 → 1161.06] everyone else is going to agree with me, but I think it's freaking fantastic I'm getting one for
[1161.06 → 1170.10] jerseys uh this was posted by WMA groom AK on the forum uh it is a pc per article, and it's from
[1170.10 → 1177.40] sonic it is the sonic SIMD let's have a look at this thing it's the system cable management device
[1177.40 → 1181.58] that's what you think they could have what you know what I would say you think they would come up with
[1181.58 → 1186.54] like if they're going to have a four letter name they could do something sexy you know like the next puck
[1186.54 → 1193.90] or whatever it is and that was yeah SIMD doesn't like skimmed I'm just going to go down to the
[1193.90 → 1202.68] store and buy some skimmed uh so what's cool about this is its this bar what is this sound good um
[1202.68 → 1208.66] someone is shuffling through some equipment over there um sorry about that twitch chat but it and
[1208.66 → 1213.78] YouTube later on, but it's this bar that you can put into the back of your computer you can see there's
[1213.78 → 1217.82] some SSDs mounted here and stuff, and you plug all your power supply cables into the bottom of the
[1217.82 → 1224.92] bar, and then you branch off them later on higher up so it's yeah speaking of next they have um a few
[1224.92 → 1229.26] of their cases on so I know the s340s know for this they have the cable management bar built in but
[1229.26 → 1235.48] this one looks a little bit a little bit more like a one size fits most kind of solution instead yes and
[1235.48 → 1240.38] my understanding of it right now is like because in this picture in this picture it shows that it's
[1240.38 → 1246.62] connected directly to the power supply but uh this bar you can see is off by itself there like I don't
[1246.62 → 1250.54] I don't have a ton of pictures of this thing, but my understanding is that you should be able to get
[1250.54 → 1255.80] it separately that's what yeah it kind of I mean if they're going to if they're going to enter if
[1255.80 → 1262.02] they're going to introduce this thing called the scooped, and they'll make a big deal out of it you
[1262.02 → 1267.64] would think that you could buy it without buying a c-sonic power supply, so apparently that is a RGB
[1267.64 → 1274.44] logo so this c-sonic logo is RGB uh can I say I'm a little bit surprised by this because it's RGB
[1274.44 → 1280.98] c-sonics whole like MO as a company they're they're very like straightforward not a lot of frills
[1280.98 → 1285.06] like if any of you all if you all follow c-sonic on Twitter you probably know what I'm talking about
[1285.06 → 1291.08] but the stuff they make is pretty good so I really like even something even we were not compensated to
[1291.08 → 1296.56] say that just personal opinion but um but uh well if you look at my uh personal rig there's a c-sonic
[1296.56 → 1300.56] right yeah Geodude has a c-sonic power supply that's right but yeah even that was not a sponsorship
[1300.56 → 1305.92] sorry it's fine no just I was just going to say even something is you know a simple provision of a RGB
[1305.92 → 1310.58] logo surprises me a bit but I think it looks pretty sharp yeah yeah yeah like even their prime power
[1310.58 → 1316.32] supplies there's no RGB on it um but yeah apparently it does drop your efficiency by one percent overall
[1316.32 → 1325.32] that's really not a lot um my main thing is in what it looks like this case right here in my case at
[1325.32 → 1330.32] home cable management in the back of tempered glass cases especially when there's not a big gap
[1330.32 → 1336.46] is a nightmare yeah and this looks perfect yeah and that's the trend now isn't it because
[1336.46 → 1340.88] you're seeing more and more cases that even like reasonable price points where it's tempered glass
[1340.88 → 1345.06] all the way around and I think there was just an assumption that people thought this would be cool
[1345.06 → 1350.46] and that has been true to a degree, but there's also plenty of you out there that just want to hide
[1350.46 → 1355.70] all the messy cable routing behind the motherboard tray so it looks like it can power some fans
[1355.70 → 1359.60] are those you see this are those fans or those SATA
[1359.60 → 1365.34] I'm pretty sure those are fans I think you're right yeah those look like fan cables yeah
[1365.34 → 1371.74] everything is seems like it's seemingly intelligently placed to like this looks like a
[1371.74 → 1376.60] sat abridge coming right off of there with a really short run directly just because you have
[1376.60 → 1381.06] some right there, so this is right up at the top, and it's your CPU power 24 pins right off on that
[1381.06 → 1384.86] side like it looks like they've paid attention it does as long as you're not running some like weird
[1384.86 → 1388.54] exotic setup where you have like SATA headers like all the way up towards the top it looks like it's
[1388.54 → 1392.96] probably fine for most systems even then it might work i just I don't have very good pictures I don't
[1392.96 → 1399.30] know yeah and this okay to be fair this little blue cable I just realized almost certainly doesn't
[1399.30 → 1406.06] come with it these are probably after markets um maybe they sell them as like a kit that like
[1406.06 → 1409.84] goes with it, we'll have to see I don't know a ton about it right it could just be cable mod cables
[1409.84 → 1413.52] I don't know but I actually think that's really cool that's that's the first I have this
[1413.52 → 1419.16] happens every show I don't know why Google Docs decides to sing me out part way through every
[1419.16 → 1423.46] single time that's so annoying that's happened to me before when I've tried to upload tech cookie
[1423.46 → 1429.58] videos thanks google but um, but it's its the first time in a long time that I've looked at
[1429.58 → 1437.40] a piece of computer hardware and been like I am going to buy that basically now and put it in my
[1437.40 → 1441.66] system right away the one percent efficiency drop is hilarious to me not because well I do think
[1441.66 → 1446.24] it's good that they're being transparent about it but I can see someone out there with like an 80 plus
[1446.24 → 1450.44] power supply like the lowest year of 80 plus, and then he hooked this thing up to it, and they're like
[1450.44 → 1458.00] oh well there goes my superior efficiency to to that you know um raid max power supply my
[1458.00 → 1463.66] will be a neighbour blah blah whatever so uh apparently it will come in three sizes which
[1463.66 → 1469.18] makes sense there's probably like general it cases general mate oh are they going to make
[1469.18 → 1475.24] different sizes yeah that's great yeah you know and I know I said this before but I'm still baffled as
[1475.24 → 1483.26] to why mate is not a more popular thing if you're a gamer it's like the most logical for a factor to get
[1483.26 → 1487.76] but that's a different discussion so yeah I think it's i I like it, and it's really not popular but
[1487.76 → 1496.20] i yeah I agree and I have no idea why but on that note of having no idea why I have no idea why if
[1496.20 → 1501.72] you are making a new website and don't have a website yet for your like small business or self
[1501.72 → 1508.22] or whatever you don't check out Squarespace uh they have 24 7 live chat and email support so if you have
[1508.22 → 1512.62] any problems I have no idea why you wouldn't just contact them also it's only 12 bucks a month and you
[1512.62 → 1517.60] get a free domain if you subscribe for a year they have responsive design so it looks great on your
[1517.60 → 1524.58] various devices like your phone your tablet your laptop your watch your desktop whatever your TV
[1524.58 → 1529.64] doesn't even matter they have commerce modules so you can have a free built-in online store if you
[1529.64 → 1537.00] want to sell some stuff which is really cool no screw off don't restart I pick a time which is not now
[1537.00 → 1543.04] we're just having some slight technical difficulties 9 p.m I hate Windows 10 why are we using Windows 10
[1543.04 → 1549.72] on this computer anyway moving on uh cover pages if you want to have like a one simple page set up
[1549.72 → 1555.12] which is just good for like resumes or cover letters or like hey look at me this is my about me page
[1555.12 → 1560.84] it's perfect for that also everyone can now publish content in the Apple news format directly from their
[1560.84 → 1565.82] Squarespace blog module which makes it available to millions of potential users because there are tons of

[1569.54 → 1575.52] and when you do decide to sign up check out this link right here squarespace.com
[1575.52 → 1582.38] slash wan and offer and put in offer code want to save 10 off your first purchase you know I also have
[1582.38 → 1588.52] problems saying Squarespace whenever I do it whenever I do a Squarespace thing for tech rookie I say
[1588.52 → 1594.96] squarespace I almost said that I don't think I've ever done that before yeah maybe it was like
[1594.96 → 1602.06] your presence oh my god see now I'm just ruining the rest of like our productions now and I hope
[1602.06 → 1610.86] why this isn't want to ruin things like your accounting and like your write-offs you could use
[1610.86 → 1616.26] FreshBooks you should use FreshBooks to keep track of everything uh FreshBooks is the super simple invoicing
[1616.26 → 1623.56] tool that actually does a lot more than just uh invoices it helps you keep track of uh your invoices it
[1623.56 → 1628.06] helps you keep track of your expenses it helps you keep track of your hours all that kind of stuff
[1628.06 → 1633.00] it keeps track of who owes you what which is great it also has a feature that tells you when your
[1633.00 → 1638.04] clients look at an invoice for the first time, and it has a mobile app which has all the functionality
[1638.04 → 1643.00] of their desktop application which is perfect because a lot of new business uh owners just use
[1643.00 → 1647.72] phones to run through their stuff so they can move around and do things uh you can take FreshBooks
[1647.72 → 1652.20] wherever you go which is great if you have any questions feel free to reach out to their support staff or
[1652.20 → 1659.64] you'll speak to a human no phone tree no escalations no return calls just answers also visit freshbooks.com
[1659.64 → 1664.84] slash wan enter wan in how do you hear about a section when you sign up to get a free trial which
[1664.84 → 1670.90] is pretty cool and speaking of pretty cool Ltd you're pretty cool if you show up to Ltd because then
[1670.90 → 1677.98] I'll see you um and that would be pretty neat Ltd is a meetup and interactive tech event the interactive
[1677.98 → 1684.46] honestly the meetup part is hopefully cool you get to meet all of us here at Linus media group um
[1684.46 → 1688.94] which might sound weird because I'm not part of whatever don't worry about um but you get to
[1688.94 → 1695.34] meet everyone from Linus media group plus me uh and the really cool part though and the reason in my
[1695.34 → 1701.66] opinion why you should go is because it is an interactive tech event it's not just a convention where you get
[1701.66 → 1705.74] to go see a couple booths, and you maybe take a picture with someone, and you bail there are actual
[1705.74 → 1711.82] things to do stuff yeah amazing like i'm not even kidding or trying to oversell this at all i
[1711.82 → 1716.86] had so much fun last year it was very, very enjoyable I liked it as well and like it was so cool that
[1716.86 → 1721.66] rod and Bob were there and showing people how to do hardline water cooling bends with actual tubes you
[1721.66 → 1726.54] got to sit there with a heat gun and make a tube bend with hardline water tubing which takes some of the
[1726.54 → 1731.98] the fear out of it this year we're going to be deleting tutorial leading the CPUs that is sick
[1731.98 → 1735.82] where else can you just try to learn that from people that really know what they're talking about
[1735.82 → 1739.74] I don't know Ltd is a really cool event if you want to check it out you absolutely should it is
[1739.74 → 1746.06] held on July 14th at the Richmond Olympic oval in Richmond bc I know it's in Canada I'm sorry try to
[1746.06 → 1751.10] get here if you can the good news is you don't have to know how to skate that's true unlike in 2010
[1751.10 → 1756.22] when they had the Olympics there, and they had speed skating yeah that is gone so you can just walk
[1756.22 → 1761.82] in you don't have to skate in yeah it's completely fine uh current booths include a blind
[1761.82 → 1767.18] cable management competition brought to you by cable mod a delisting workshop so you can bring your CPUs
[1767.18 → 1772.94] and we'll show you how to debit it a cable toss or sorry case toss 2.0 which is cool that was a good
[1772.94 → 1777.90] idea that it got updated uh multi-headed VR so you can go up against each other in VR which is cool a LAN
[1778.62 → 1784.86] like that's cool we're going to have like an actual lantern yeah yeah a 12k ultra-wide gaming setup
[1784.86 → 1793.66] what that's like 4k but times three um and more there will be more on top of that
[1793.66 → 1799.34] there's going to be food there's going to be music there's going to be music probably okay where's Colton
[1800.78 → 1803.74] I wonder like is it live music or are we just going to play music or speakers
[1805.02 → 1810.38] um please direct all inquiries uh twitter at Colton underscore potter that ask him everything
[1810.38 → 1815.18] there's going to be cool systems to look at for sure more room more games more swag than last year the
[1815.18 → 1819.26] fact that we have more swag is insane because every single person left with at least one thing last
[1819.26 → 1824.46] year there are special guests there's exclusive live unboxing just like last line this will probably
[1824.46 → 1829.66] drop something probably yeah uh and more which includes the line is dropping something come hang
[1829.66 → 1834.14] out tickets start at 35 Canadian that's really not that much money it really is its worth almost
[1834.14 → 1838.78] nothing 35 Canadian if you're American or from the EU you probably have that much in like whatever your
[1838.78 → 1844.54] currency is just in your couch cushions right now so, and you can check it says them out but what
[1844.54 → 1849.82] that's weird it's just you can check the link out in the link below uh or on screen if you're watching
[1849.82 → 1858.78] on twitch over there Ltd expo.com it's its super hard to get to um and then that brings us to the
[1858.78 → 1866.38] float plane uh which I don't know if I have we had a very very very illuminating episode of tech
[1866.38 → 1871.42] quickie out on float plane today oh very illuminating what one is it should, I tell them
[1871.42 → 1878.14] or are we really trying to plug this one yeah oh that's pretty interesting isn't it though
[1879.02 → 1883.50] see if this guy says it's interesting he's been doing this longer than I have so that's actually i
[1884.22 → 1889.66] yeah I don't know yeah and I want to know so we're gonna we're going to show my screen so it doesn't seem
[1889.66 → 1896.22] insane, but there's a tech cookie episode on the fastest possible internet how fast can you actually
[1896.22 → 1904.30] go yeah how fast can you download gotta go fast questionable videos yeah pretty much that's a
[1904.30 → 1912.62] question uh there 's's uh AMD's 32 core FM to intel wow that's a little for a second I thought
[1912.62 → 1918.14] you're going to read out a model number that started with FM yeah but uh portable professional
[1918.14 → 1923.42] workstation with three displays that thing is actually insane and a pumpless liquid cooler from
[1923.42 → 1927.82] der Bauer which that's another video both these videos at the top I'm super interested in checking
[1927.82 → 1933.66] out anytime der Bauer does anything it's amazing it sounds very like German and intense you know well
[1933.66 → 1938.54] yeah it is engineering uh also there is nitwit ultra on here and tech deals I'm not going to show you
[1938.54 → 1944.30] their guy's their stuff because I don't know if I'm like really necessarily even allowed to but if
[1944.30 → 1950.06] you're a fan of tech deals or if you're a fan of kyle at nitwit uh check out their channels as well
[1950.06 → 1954.62] their stuff comes on here a week early everyone's using the same model right now full plane does not
[1954.62 → 1959.18] make people use this exact model, but everyone has done the exact same thing which is fine, but it's
[1959.18 → 1963.42] three bucks per channel so far every single person has gone with three dollars, and you get their content
[1963.42 → 1970.22] a week early the comment section is awesome because there's way less cancer than on YouTube uh way less
[1970.22 → 1975.10] it's like always positive discussion which is super cool, and we have uh in terms of features that are
[1975.10 → 1978.70] coming soon one of the really cool ones that people have been asking for a while is playback
[1978.70 → 1983.66] speed there are some guys that apparently watch it like two times or one and a half times on YouTube
[1983.66 → 1989.34] they just gotta get stuff done i I'm guilty of watching things at 1.5x on YouTube sometimes that
[1989.34 → 1995.02] is that that's actually a good feature fully operational uh relatively soon and just the comment
[1995.02 → 2000.70] session thing on float plane you can actually have a comment score the negative so if someone just posts
[2000.70 → 2008.14] like if someone just posts the hottest of takes they'll get like a minus 50 so I think it was on
[2008.14 → 2014.70] this video but I don't see it, but someone said first, and they're just like no that was on that was on
[2014.70 → 2019.02] mine oh that was on that was on today's tech wiki that was so funny
[2020.94 → 2027.42] yeah they're minus 29 yeah just slammed so uh yeah you can do that
[2027.42 → 2034.54] yeah it's possible um for those of you who watched um already thanks very much shout out to
[2034.54 → 2038.30] Portugal you'll know what I'm talking about if you watched is not you'll see next week shout out to
[2038.30 → 2044.22] Portugal I mentioned Portugal very randomly in my video I'm definitely going to watch that yeah so
[2044.22 → 2049.58] thank you to all of our fans in Porto in Lisbon in the Azores wherever you may be in Portugal
[2050.70 → 2057.02] good luck in the world cup, so heck yeah all right okay moving on to back to uh news topics thank you
[2057.02 → 2065.26] atlas race for posting this on the forum AMD unveils seven nanometre GPU at computer super
[2065.26 → 2068.62] cool let me just get this stuff if you want to start I'm going to get this stuff in twitch chat
[2068.62 → 2074.30] and sure on the screen okay um also at computer big surprise there right um AMD announced the first
[2074.30 → 2080.70] seven nanometre GPU launching in the second half of 2018 it's a big deal because intel has a big deal
[2080.70 → 2085.50] intel hasn't even gotten to 10 yet and AMD is already announcing hey we're going to have a seven
[2085.50 → 2090.86] nanometre GPU oh well this is a GPU so to be fair to intel they make it's a little different yeah
[2090.86 → 2097.74] well um what does NVIDIA have right now do they have been they on 10 yet uh I admittedly have forgotten
[2098.62 → 2102.38] yeah I'm pretty I'm sure twitch has screaming at me for that intel gaffe by the way because we're
[2102.38 → 2108.70] talking about GPUs, but that's okay see they've been on 10 for a while oh have they okay
[2108.70 → 2121.42] why am I blanking I shouldn't be yeah uh 1080 I just love having dead air oh it's great
[2122.06 → 2129.10] it's so great it's I mean it's um oh no, no yeah 16 yeah pascal 14, so pascal is what 14 16 and 14
[2129.10 → 2135.74] 16 and 14 okay so there you go so yes so we're they're basically having that AMD is having that um
[2135.74 → 2141.74] with Vega so AMD will have Vega on seven nanometres inside the new radon instinct part uh they're
[2141.74 → 2147.74] claiming 25 or excuse me 35 percent more performance over the previous gen 14 nanometre part so
[2147.74 → 2152.38] they're so they're having it is what they're doing yeah is I remember there was a split and I was trying
[2152.38 → 2159.58] to think of what number is it split on, but okay 14 nanometers is 10 30 10 50 10 50 10 50 ti so the lower
[2159.58 → 2165.50] end silicon is 14 and then for the higher end ships are we using 16 yeah oh but yeah with 10 60 okay
[2165.50 → 2170.94] yeah I see yeah 16 so there you go so and these latest offerings are either 14 or 16 depending on
[2170.94 → 2176.62] what you get AMD is going down to seven uh twice the power efficiency so which kind of makes sense
[2176.62 → 2182.46] right because it's two times the density of their last gen which was 14 so um this now mean sandy is
[2182.46 → 2188.14] ahead of the GPU game in this one area because even Volta and the newer gen architecture is at 12
[2188.14 → 2195.02] nanometres right now so uh but do note that there actually isn't an industry standard way
[2195.50 → 2203.58] to measure transistor sizes so um you're it I think it used to mean a little bit more than it does
[2203.58 → 2209.42] now so do take that number with a small grain of salt, but it's still a pretty big deal also remember
[2209.42 → 2216.94] that it's I believe it's square nanometres, so seven is like considerably smaller than 10 right yeah yeah
[2216.94 → 2222.54] it's just like how four square inches is a lot smaller than yeah, so yeah okay just a thing to remember
[2222.54 → 2228.54] there you go uh someone in the twitch chat reminded me of that so thank you to whoever that was so
[2228.54 → 2234.38] prepare for high wattage power supplies being even dumber unless you have a water chiller from an
[2234.38 → 2240.30] aquarium hook in your computer so yes, yes of course now okay wow what is that cacophony back there
[2241.18 → 2247.74] loud noises uh, so this is another really, really cool piece of news in my opinion this is posted by
[2247.74 → 2257.26] Shreya one on the forum gigabyte making fake ram it's fake except it's super cool and you want
[2257.26 → 2262.54] it to be fake so I'll explain that in a moment uh do you know about this I know about it now so
[2262.54 → 2269.26] apparently they're selling their um Horus is that how you pronounce it Horus Boris Boris Boris Boris RGB LED
[2269.26 → 2275.10] memory um which is it not surprising that's sort of that's sort of their like gamer line of stuff now so
[2275.10 → 2282.46] it's going to have all the RGB, so two of the sticks are your run-of-the-mill eight gigs uh ddr4
[2282.46 → 2288.38] memory modules yeah, but the other half of the bundle is two sticks of fake ram they're made the
[2288.38 → 2293.58] same aluminum housing but they have the LEDs that can sync up with your actual ram sticks but they
[2293.58 → 2299.58] have none of the memory bits so if you can afford to populate every single slot on your motherboard
[2299.58 → 2304.30] with actual ram, but you don't want it to look like there are big gaps in between your RGB you can get
[2304.30 → 2308.86] this instead you can save some money and have it look like they're all populated until you can
[2308.86 → 2315.34] afford more actual ram now I don't personally care at all because I've never cared about fully
[2315.34 → 2321.90] populating slots I don't think it looks bad but I'm 100 certain because I know them uh that there
[2321.90 → 2328.14] are people that do care about fully populating all their slots yeah and ram is incredibly expensive
[2328.14 → 2333.74] right now so the fact that they are able to bridge that gap a little bit you can fill all the slots
[2333.74 → 2338.14] but you don't have to spend ludicrous amounts of money well there's a certain effect you get you
[2338.14 → 2344.30] know because when you have all the slots populated if the light bars on top are thick thick enough
[2344.30 → 2349.42] then you will have an effect that looks like a big block or a big brick instead of like little strips
[2349.42 → 2354.30] of colour so yeah that so I don't mind the strips of colour thing but yeah i I just understand how people
[2354.30 → 2359.90] like that aesthetic, and it still gets you the sticks of ram that actually have memory on them in this
[2359.90 → 2365.66] kit that we're talking about here is eight gigs dims each so you're getting 16 total gigs of ram which
[2365.66 → 2370.38] is pretty solid yeah so the modules the fake modules can still communicate with the other ones
[2370.38 → 2376.78] they just don't have any actual ram on them but um so um do note if you're interested in this um right
[2376.78 → 2381.82] now you have to buy it as a whole kit, but gigabyte is considering the possibility of just selling the
[2381.82 → 2389.50] fake stick separately at some point so I think they'll do that based on can we like not and say we did
[2389.90 → 2399.50] um uh so he has no idea no uh hey there we go they'll probably end up selling them individually
[2399.50 → 2405.66] if these kits sell well enough yeah it makes sense um it's its probably like a manufacturing worthiness
[2405.66 → 2409.98] situation I could see it happening because I'm sure there's plenty of people who have bought ram they
[2409.98 → 2415.90] didn't need just so they could populate all their slots so I'm sure this happened again i I know people
[2415.90 → 2419.82] that have done that there you go I even know people that have bought the same looking kit just lower
[2419.82 → 2425.66] capacity for the second set because they're like I don't even need more ram yeah like oh man okay
[2425.66 → 2430.54] and then you get into this whole like catch 22 where even if you don't need more like oh let me just buy
[2430.54 → 2437.10] like a one gig stick of this thing, but it's higher end ram that has the RGB so you can't so yeah yeah
[2438.22 → 2444.46] um so this one moving on this was posted by sc2 Mitch on the forum just like every week dude thank you
[2444.46 → 2452.30] very much for posting uh the source of this article is motherboard.vice.com as many of you have
[2452.30 → 2459.90] probably heard GitHub is being purchased by Microsoft now GitHub and GitLab are different things I'm just
[2459.90 → 2465.10] putting that out here for people that may not know uh so git for the context of this story
[2465.10 → 2471.74] GitLab is not being purchased by Microsoft GitHub is being purchased by Microsoft uh this 13 000 projects
[2471.74 → 2477.82] ditched GitHub for GitLab Monday morning thing is a little out of date the current number that we have
[2477.82 → 2488.14] is I believe 150 000 of them have ditched GitHub for GitLab um now more projects have bailed off of GitHub
[2488.14 → 2495.18] in that time uh these are just the ones that have gone to GitLab specifically um there are other solutions
[2495.18 → 2504.38] but that that's the majority of the movers have done that now to put to rest a little bit of the
[2504.38 → 2510.78] freak out from the information that I've been able to see online and some of the stuff that's in this
[2510.78 → 2519.82] exact article it seems like most people are bailing because they're making like Xbox emulators well here's
[2519.82 → 2525.82] I mean like things that Microsoft that are going against Microsoft specifically well there's okay
[2525.82 → 2529.98] obviously something like an emulator you can see the problems there with like IP and copyright
[2529.98 → 2536.78] infringement but okay so just uh one example I can think of that has some pretty recent relevance
[2536.78 → 2543.18] um if you go on YouTube shameless plug for tech wiki we did a recent tech wiki episode on DNS leak
[2543.18 → 2548.38] and how they can undermine your privacy and how they can expose your browsing history even if you're using a VPN
[2548.38 → 2557.34] so let's say you're using a VPN that has um a DNS leak protection feature on it yeah um, so there is a
[2557.90 → 2563.18] feature in Windows 8 and in Windows 10 um it has a really long acronym I can't exactly remember what
[2563.18 → 2568.54] it is right um smear I think is what it's called, but it is a feature and there's a reason I'm doing
[2568.54 → 2575.26] the quotation fingers that can't apparently even override DNS leak protection and compromise your privacy
[2575.26 → 2581.90] yeah um, so there was someone on GitHub that wrote a patch for open VPN uh where you could just
[2581.90 → 2587.02] download it, and it would like to take care of that for you when Microsoft considers something like that
[2587.02 → 2591.58] undermining their own software if they don't want people doing that you know because I mean copyright
[2591.58 → 2597.26] infringement is one thing it's super obvious but what if it's like there's an actual problem with
[2597.26 → 2602.54] a Microsoft product like windows that someone is in good faith trying to fix for people
[2603.50 → 2608.14] and Microsoft just says no and people wouldn't know where to look because so many people just
[2608.14 → 2612.46] kind of automatically go to GitHub and think the stuff is going to be on there so yeah it's going
[2612.46 → 2618.70] to be interesting and also I forgot to post the YouTube announcement so rip um and there's like not
[2618.70 → 2622.30] even that much time left in the show but I just published it, so people will be able to see watch the
[2622.30 → 2627.98] last seven minutes or however long we however long we have I don't know so uh anyway it's its
[2627.98 → 2637.58] it's yeah people are even thinking projects that could easily be used to harm others like deepfakes
[2637.58 → 2643.74] might be a problem and a lot of those types of projects have bailed already okay which sucks because
[2643.74 → 2651.98] deepfakes can also be used to not hurt people yeah just like a power drill yeah pretty much so like
[2652.38 → 2658.86] we'll have to see how Microsoft deals with this um trying to connect you are offline oh great
[2658.86 → 2666.78] uh I got it but yeah i just I don't think it's going to be as nuclear as people think I suspect
[2666.78 → 2673.66] Microsoft isn't going to do a ton different with it than was already being done with GitHub hopefully
[2673.66 → 2680.14] everything doesn't become weird coloured squares because I really have oh good lord yeah really have not
[2680.14 → 2685.42] enjoyed Microsoft UI for a long time it kind of depends I mean I think there were fears about
[2685.42 → 2691.74] that with something like UWP for example uh but at the same time you know the desktop experience on
[2691.74 → 2700.22] Windows 10 is still like largely open whatever sense you want garbage I hate the desktop
[2700.22 → 2706.70] experience on Windows 10 sorry oh, oh no I'm not talking about ui is different from whether the
[2706.70 → 2711.26] platform is open or closed okay yeah yeah yeah UI is a totally different story like you can hate the
[2711.26 → 2716.78] UI all you want to but um that is a preference thing I know some people are going to screech i just
[2717.90 → 2722.22] I don't personally do you want to do um, um this thing here
[2725.02 → 2730.86] or this thing is better either one sure I don't know a ton about it is cool I don't know a ton about
[2730.86 → 2739.26] it but let's let's dive into it see what we can get so thank you club 3d q u b 3d cub cute oh i
[2739.26 → 2746.22] think it's cube it's just of course it's its just a very tortured spelling of cubed I failed that one
[2746.22 → 2752.62] it is cubed for sureties all right you've steak forbs is the source article here and there's been so
[2752.62 → 2759.34] once it loads my internet is uh not the happiest at the moment uh, but there's been some leaks of the
[2759.34 → 2766.06] pixel 3. now one interesting thing here is that there's going to be three phones there's going
[2766.06 → 2770.94] to be the standard normal pixel there's going to be the pixel XL those are already expected now there's
[2770.94 → 2777.10] going to be a mid-range phone, and they don't mean size they don't mean between the normal size pixel
[2777.10 → 2781.98] they're talking like power yeah they mean power and price and stuff like that what is going on i
[2781.98 → 2786.06] don't care about your quote of the day load the web page please it's hard to fly without ruffling a
[2786.06 → 2794.62] few feathers I'm trying to ruffle your feathers forbs let me fly please hello okay oh my goodness
[2794.62 → 2802.46] awesome all right well the cool part is that there are three phones there's the affordable pixel 3 uh which
[2802.46 → 2807.10] is the interesting one in this lineup not because the other ones aren't interesting but because it's
[2807.10 → 2812.46] new um so the affordable pixel 3 which is what we're going to call instead of mid-range just so we don't get
[2812.46 → 2818.30] confused by the sizing things it is a likely going to be a game changer for mid-range smartphone
[2818.30 → 2823.98] photography and that kind of makes sense because a lot of the awesomeness of the pixel camera is in
[2823.98 → 2831.42] the software, and they can put that software on the cheap phone which is really cool the 3xl is going to
[2831.42 → 2839.90] have a notch however you feel about this yeah that's happening so I'm gonna I'm all we'll have to see but
[2839.90 → 2845.58] I'm almost certainly going to be getting a pixel 3 okay um i currently still have my pixel 1 XL
[2846.30 → 2852.78] and I like this phone a lot, but it's starting to show the signs of being tired the battery starting
[2852.78 → 2859.26] kind of yeah yeah there's like it started yeah you can tell I can't, I can't any more it's its still a
[2859.26 → 2864.38] very good phone if I wasn't a ridiculous power user of my phone I wouldn't care that much but
[2864.38 → 2871.66] I am an absolute ridiculous power user oh we have a power user oh yeah boy um I'm always on this thing
[2871.66 → 2878.30] and I do a lot of stuff on it so I'm stoked and I will probably get the XL okay because I have large
[2878.30 → 2886.14] hands I can hide my whole phone um so oh look a power user with his large hands yeah dude so the
[2886.14 → 2892.22] small phones are just a little too small let's see yeah no not quite this is a 6p so yeah they're
[2892.22 → 2898.14] pretty similar okay um so I want the XL that means I have to deal with the notch traditionally i
[2898.14 → 2904.22] haven't really liked notches, but it might work if the notch is small enough which I can't see because
[2904.22 → 2911.50] forms won't load uh I saw some I saw some allegedly leaked images of the thing it does look a fair bit
[2911.50 → 2918.38] smaller than the iPhone 10 the notch does which makes sense right because on android what how it does
[2918.38 → 2923.26] does notifications it fills them in from the sides right but on iPhone that doesn't happen
[2923.26 → 2928.70] they all your notifications are just in that little tray so if they is it is just a fairly small
[2928.70 → 2934.86] one that's cool I'm down they also has front-facing speakers which I can't show you because they
[2934.86 → 2939.26] won't load by the way I don't think this is forbs's fault just in case anyone in the audience is like
[2939.26 → 2944.14] what the heck I was making jokes about not being able to fly because of the forbs thing whatever I think
[2944.14 → 2951.10] our internet's being super weird uh because I had this problem earlier, but yeah okay so i I don't
[2951.10 → 2955.42] know that's super cool I can't show you what the small one looks like I can't show you what the mid-range
[2955.42 → 2962.14] one looks like uh it apparently the uh the mid-range phone it's me based on Qualcomm's new
[2962.14 → 2970.14] snapdragon 710 chipsets which promises performance close to 2017's flagship snapdragon 835.
[2970.14 → 2978.94] um yeah i I think that will be cool because one big issue that people had with pixel phones when
[2978.94 → 2983.18] they started being called pixel was that they were a lot more expensive than people wanted so being
[2983.18 → 2987.82] able to give a more affordable option is cool that's definitely maybe it'll stick maybe it'll be
[2987.82 → 2997.90] it'll go the way the iPhone 5c who knows yeah yeah Australian gamers are being blamed for slow internet
[2997.90 → 3009.10] wow okay apparently this was slightly taken out of context uh this is from abc.net.au uh maybe this will load
[3010.70 → 3020.22] uh maybe not I'm gonna post this in twitch chat and if you're watching on YouTube there are either
[3021.18 → 3027.50] um time stamps posted in the description of this video or I have noticed many wonderful people
[3027.50 → 3034.22] also post their own custom time stamps below the video in the comments wow this looks like it's not
[3034.22 → 3040.14] properly loading, but it's sort of working so let's show that screen why not I really like how the image
[3040.14 → 3047.58] they used for this story is a screen cap from big bang like what they don't what the heck that is them
[3047.58 → 3054.46] what are they doing is this like a retro edition I don't watch this show I don't know it's always been
[3054.46 → 3060.54] kind of weird to me but anyway moving on uh believe it or not some of the biggest online games
[3060.54 → 3065.66] use very little data when you're playing compared to streaming HD video or even high fidelity audio so
[3065.66 → 3071.42] people are slamming back at whoever the heck said this I don't care it doesn't matter uh because he's
[3071.42 → 3079.66] like gamers are blah blah but apparently the within the context that he was saying it uh, so someone named
[3079.66 → 3085.74] Moro I don't know said it's gamers product predominantly on fixed wireless apparently
[3085.74 → 3093.66] what he meant is it's that he's typecasting gamers not saying that games are right because
[3093.66 → 3099.82] later on he said that the people who game are also the power they tend to like consume more data
[3099.82 → 3103.66] just across the board whether it's video or whether they're watching twitch streams they're watching
[3103.66 → 3109.50] YouTube they're they're streaming audio while they play their game they're these are power users of
[3109.50 → 3116.30] the internet because people asked uh he originally said extreme users and then he was asked to
[3116.30 → 3121.26] clarify on that so he said it's gamers predominantly on fixed wireless but I don't think he meant
[3121.26 → 3126.70] it is video games that are the problem I think he was saying like man it's gamers which I also think
[3126.70 → 3131.10] is not necessarily true because out of all the people that I know that watch a ludicrous amount of
[3131.10 → 3135.58] streaming video it's not necessarily gamers no I mean you have people that think
[3135.58 → 3140.70] oh like video games are stupid but they'll sit there and they'll binge Netflix like eight hours
[3140.70 → 3145.82] at a time and that takes more bandwidth so yeah it's not that's not the best look for him at least
[3145.82 → 3151.50] to people coming home no cracking a bottle of wine yeah and chugging it while binging multiple seasons
[3151.50 → 3157.98] at a time of your favourite show of yeah whatever people who don't game watch so I don't I'm not very up on
[3157.98 → 3164.38] on this hip alcoholic terminology so sorry if I said that wrong but yes like wine yeah yeah they
[3164.38 → 3168.78] didn't call it wine anymore I don't know man well I said crack in a bottle of wine than I realized you
[3168.78 → 3175.26] don't do that you uncork it you do the thing and then you crack a bottle of beer I'm a hip man
[3175.90 → 3181.50] I'm I'm in with the boys now it's time for you to the Macarena I'm hip I'm with it
[3181.50 → 3189.66] but yeah i I don't know i I think it's just something taken out of context I don't think
[3189.66 → 3193.82] it's actually what people are freaking out about people just like screaming I think the guy is just
[3193.82 → 3199.34] saying it's power users it's people that use the internet a lot it's its this stuff yeah um if he
[3199.34 → 3204.46] actually thinks it's video games he now for sure knows that it's not because everyone on the planet
[3204.46 → 3210.78] has told him you're wrong um so I think he gets it now and we can probably hopefully move on but i
[3210.78 → 3215.26] thought it was an interesting story anyway and something to bring up Australia's internet
[3215.26 → 3222.86] is actually garbage um and one thing that i I am very aggressively against is that um apparently
[3222.86 → 3228.06] they've been considering throttling back data consumption of extreme users during peak periods
[3228.06 → 3235.10] that's ridiculous Australia just fix your freaking internet it's not that hard everyone else has
[3235.10 → 3240.30] seemed to figure this out um might be a cost issue they are in an unfortunate place
[3240.78 → 3247.82] yeah for undersea cables figure it out I don't know what else to say Australia's internet has
[3247.82 → 3252.94] been garbage for a very long time working at flow plane it's super expensive to get bandwidth there
[3253.58 → 3258.30] I'm trying to serve people in Australia videos and it's hard it's got to be a cost issue because I mean
[3258.30 → 3264.38] I mean how many times have we had people coming on the forum saying oh like this GPU
[3264.94 → 3269.42] costs almost twice as much in Australia because reasons so I imagine it might be similar here
[3269.42 → 3274.30] i just Australia's internet is just garbage I know quite a few people from Australia and it's
[3274.86 → 3281.02] it's really, really expensive and it's really, really bad um and it's a shame because i I don't think it
[3281.02 → 3286.70] needs to be I understand that there is definitely cost implications but there are countries not that
[3286.70 → 3293.82] far away um that have really expensive and terrible they're the stadium nachos of internet yeah okay
[3293.82 → 3298.70] yeah Australia yeah you have the stadium nachos of internet I like that analogy and you know i
[3298.70 → 3302.70] don't understand like people like that fake cheese sauce that tastes like plastic a lot of people like
[3302.70 → 3306.94] that stuff it's disgusting why do you even bother yeah it's so bad no just like order a hot dog or
[3306.94 → 3314.70] something like just or do what I did and smuggle in four spicy chickens from Wendy's into a movie
[3314.70 → 3321.10] that's a great idea and trade them for other things bartering I hope no one's I hope no one's
[3321.10 → 3327.10] from Cineplex watching this they won't let me back into a movie boy I get it done also organic
[3327.10 → 3334.86] carbon module modules organic carbon molecules found on Mars NASA's Mars rover curiosity has
[3334.86 → 3341.18] identified a variety of organic molecules the carbon-based building blocks of life as we know it
[3341.18 → 3349.02] in 3.5 billion-year-old rocks on Mars this does not give us any evidence of life necessarily, but there's
[3349.02 → 3355.82] a chance that the organics are a form of an ancient life source of some kind we just don't
[3355.82 → 3362.94] know another finding that methane concentrations in Mars atmosphere cycle seasonally the discovery
[3362.94 → 3369.82] suggests that the gas is seeping out from underground reservoirs it is possible that some of the methane
[3369.82 → 3377.02] was produced by organisms as it is here on earth be very careful that everything in his in this has
[3377.02 → 3384.22] possible um written all over if it's not necessarily guaranteed they did find organic carbon
[3384.22 → 3391.74] molecules and methane concentrations in ours mars atmosphere do cycle around seasonally we got that
[3391.74 → 3396.62] the rest of it is all hypotheticals impossible I wonder exactly what organics they found because um
[3396.62 → 3400.78] obviously you know just because it has a carbon atom, and it doesn't mean it you know came from life you
[3400.78 → 3405.02] know like see, but a lot of people don't know that which is why we gotta really qualify yeah
[3405.02 → 3410.94] the possible like methane is an extremely simple molecule it could form without life around very
[3410.94 → 3414.70] easily so yeah I was trying to look through the story to see if there were any more meets but it
[3414.70 → 3420.78] didn't say don't think too many um but yeah I think that's honestly about it the rest of the
[3420.78 → 3425.98] stuff in the doc is not crazy interesting there's the Amazon thing we can go over that real quick but
[3425.98 → 3430.54] oh it doesn't have anything to do with tech so I don't really know why it kind of it do I think it does
[3430.54 → 3438.62] the fact that they sell well is that that is Amazon and i yeah it's a store like it's its an on i
[3438.62 → 3443.98] don't know why we always end up talking about Amazon the fact that it was online made it a federal
[3443.98 → 3451.18] crime okay but online shopping yeah is old as heck and Amazon is just like taking over the whole planet
[3452.78 → 3457.58] that's like they're like political level instead of like basically tech news but whatever we'll talk
[3457.58 → 3464.22] about it Amazon return policy abusers were sentenced to nearly six years in prison basically they bought
[3464.22 → 3471.26] a whack ton of GoPro and other stuff so for two years the finals not sure what that means I'm assuming
[3471.26 → 3475.98] that's that's their name yeah they're a merry they're a merry couple yeah okay they ordered over 2700
[3475.98 → 3482.06] electronic items from Amazon including GoPro digital cameras boxes smartwatches tablets laptops and then
[3482.06 → 3488.94] they reported them as damaged and that somehow didn't get flagged automatically used a lot of
[3488.94 → 3493.50] like shell accounts and stuff so they did it from like a bunch of different accounts to try to avoid
[3493.50 → 3499.98] detection good job VPNs I'm assuming uh once Amazon replaced the products they would sell them to a
[3499.98 → 3507.66] third person denial glum ac I probably is that typo I don't know I'm assuming it doesn't matter
[3507.66 → 3515.98] Daniel glum ac, but currently it's d-a-n-i-j-e-l which is a pretty cool name um done that's if that
[3515.98 → 3520.86] is I'm sure it's just Daniel but if that is his name that name is sick someone should steal that as
[3520.86 → 3529.34] a screen name I should get a dog named donjel uh in all Aaron and Leah final are said to have
[3529.34 → 3535.66] made approximately 750 000 running the scam while glum ac made approximately 500 000
[3535.66 → 3543.58] dollars so um the couple that got nearly six years each uh the accomplice got uh two years 24
[3543.58 → 3549.26] months um so I thought this was interesting because just from a legal perspective legal corner with
[3549.26 → 3556.38] john real quick here they um they were prosecuted federally okay because it was done across
[3556.38 → 3563.34] state lines and the feds are pretty serious about like winning cases against people like if like
[3563.34 → 3568.30] I think the feds have like an over 90 conviction rate when they bring charges against people and if
[3568.30 → 3572.38] you go to federal prison I think the rule is you have to serve 85 of your sentence before you're
[3572.38 → 3577.26] eligible for parole so they're not getting out for a little while okay yeah, so apparently this wasn't
[3577.26 → 3581.74] the only thing that happened i again I don't know why Amazon means that we're talking about it but the
[3581.74 → 3587.34] Amazon fraud wasn't the only problem uh they also bounced checks they rented cars and failed to pay for
[3587.34 → 3593.42] them they sold other stolen high-end goods yeah, and they withheld rent all of which are actions that
[3593.42 → 3598.46] were taken into account during the sentencing none of which mean that it makes sense being on the wands
[3598.46 → 3604.30] show i just on that note I just realized I'm responsible for having this on here I'm sorry I just don't
[3604.30 → 3610.94] i just don't now I feel bad anyway thanks for watching we'll see you next time
[3610.94 → 3617.58] I think it's time for a morale meeting next week like we need to have a company-wide dialogue
[3617.58 → 3623.50] on how we like to treat the contributions of our fellow employees oh no and the notes were so good I think
[3623.50 → 3630.30] it's high time for this I'm sorry no i just we always talk about Amazon stuff and sometimes they
[3630.30 → 3635.26] do tech related things but not always thank you very much Squarespace Alexa thank you for see like
[3635.26 → 3640.94] that makes sense thank you very much Ltd so us for sponsoring the show and thank you very much
[3640.94 → 3647.66] FreshBooks for fresh bucks I just okay so my i just it's not always tech stuff when they make the
[3647.66 → 3651.58] stores where you can just walk in and walk out, and you just get your stuff like that's cool that's
[3651.58 → 3656.38] tech go yeah I did a tech week on Amazon Go it was good yeah I thought it was good but yeah they do have
[3656.38 → 3663.10] a lot of tech news, but it's not just automatically I don't know anyway I'm sorry john bye everyone
[3663.10 → 3665.50] I'll see you next time
