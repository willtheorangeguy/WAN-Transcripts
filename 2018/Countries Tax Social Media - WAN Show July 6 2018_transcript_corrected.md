[0.00 → 0.68] Bang.
[1.58 → 2.52] What does it mean?
[3.06 → 3.78] What does it mean?
[4.56 → 10.00] To be happy in a world where the whole, every country, everywhere is trying to go after your internet.
[10.12 → 12.58] That's basically what the news is this week.
[12.98 → 17.82] We've got European Wikipedia sites go dark to protest copyright reform.
[18.38 → 21.76] We've got that the EU internet copyright bill was rejected.
[22.14 → 22.94] Hooray, I think.
[23.10 → 25.16] I don't know a ton about it, to be completely honest.
[25.16 → 29.86] We've got kids trapped in caves in Thailand and Elon Musk trying to save them.
[30.00 → 32.06] Apparently that makes sense.
[32.16 → 32.82] This is crazy!
[34.46 → 46.36] Also, Uganda has a new social media tax, which is actually incredibly expensive compared to how much people make in general over there.
[46.62 → 47.66] This is not the way.
[48.30 → 48.92] Roll the intro!
[50.10 → 50.94] Where is it?
[51.60 → 52.28] Good.
[53.72 → 54.52] It's good!
[57.74 → 58.94] Oh, no.
[60.00 → 64.70] Couch, couch, couch.
[65.06 → 68.88] Someone sent me a message on the forum, and they thought that Lance is wearing a Tunnel Bear shirt here.
[69.62 → 71.34] And it actually really looks like it.
[71.58 → 72.40] I see it.
[72.42 → 72.90] It's not.
[73.12 → 74.96] No, I asked Ed and he showed me.
[75.08 → 75.94] It's a box.
[76.32 → 77.06] That white.
[77.54 → 78.14] Crash book!
[78.72 → 81.26] The white bar underneath his, like, says unboxing.
[81.78 → 81.94] Yeah.
[82.68 → 83.78] Yay, PIA!
[83.78 → 89.96] If you need to get around certain social taxes in Uganda.
[90.74 → 92.08] And yay, LTX!
[92.40 → 99.40] You don't need a VPN there because you'll be doing interactive stuff in, like, real life and things because it's fun and good.
[99.52 → 100.82] Public internet access.
[100.82 → 101.98] Yeah.
[103.24 → 105.52] So let's start at the top.
[106.28 → 111.78] Wikipedia did a little bit of a protest in the EU to protest copyright reform.
[111.88 → 117.78] And how they did that was they basically turned off two different sites within Wikipedia.
[117.94 → 119.58] So when you go to Wikipedia, you pick your language.
[120.10 → 122.40] And each one of those is essentially kind of its own thing.
[122.40 → 124.08] So I believe they turned off the...
[124.08 → 124.76] France and Spain?
[125.44 → 126.24] Something like that?
[126.62 → 127.02] I don't know.
[127.18 → 127.74] Italy and Italy.
[127.74 → 128.44] Spanish and Italian.
[128.82 → 135.18] The Spanish and Italian editions while in Europe were off, essentially.
[135.52 → 139.06] So if you went to the site, you just saw this giant block of text that was like...
[139.06 → 141.08] By the way, that was posted by mains on the forum.
[141.20 → 141.82] Thank you very much.
[142.02 → 142.70] I appreciate it.
[143.12 → 143.78] My main user.
[144.28 → 144.56] Yeah.
[144.92 → 148.68] You just saw a bunch of text that was like, hey, you're not seeing information.
[148.68 → 153.22] You're seeing a description of what they're trying to do and the ways that it will affect
[153.22 → 154.60] your internet usage.
[154.60 → 155.82] Look at this internet we got going on right now.
[157.10 → 158.02] There we go.
[158.66 → 158.90] Whew.
[160.16 → 160.78] That was slow.
[160.96 → 162.20] I don't think that was Engadget's fault.
[162.28 → 162.94] I think that's us.
[163.96 → 164.64] But yeah.
[164.86 → 165.10] Yeah.
[165.24 → 169.24] So that sucks for anyone who had to research anything at that point in time.
[169.24 → 169.84] Oh, God.
[171.40 → 172.14] Oh, man.
[172.14 → 176.84] I guess you could probably just go to a different version of Wikipedia and like translate the page
[176.84 → 177.16] or whatever.
[177.16 → 179.52] But yeah.
[179.82 → 185.60] So this happened ahead of the European Parliament's final vote on the controversial EU copyright
[185.60 → 191.64] directive, which is the first time the region is updating its copyright laws since 2001.
[192.16 → 197.74] They're ostensibly trying to modernize them, but it kind of looks like it's a war between
[197.74 → 203.54] content creators like movie studios and the record business.
[204.08 → 204.64] Business.
[204.64 → 209.86] Versus the giant decentralized internet of people who just want to remix and create and
[209.86 → 210.22] upload.
[210.50 → 211.12] Like memes.
[211.72 → 213.92] That's been at the centre of this for a little while.
[214.08 → 216.82] That's how a lot of people have actually heard about this is the meme problem.
[217.06 → 219.44] But it has to do with a lot of other things as well.
[219.52 → 220.40] And the link tax.
[220.98 → 221.14] Yeah.
[221.14 → 227.00] So there are two articles within the big thing, which we have linked in the WAN doc here.
[228.22 → 233.48] So if you are watching this later on, you can check the WAN doc in the link below the YouTube
[233.48 → 234.54] video or SoundCloud.
[234.98 → 238.10] Yes, there is an audio only version of this, actually.
[238.10 → 240.16] And you'll be able to find it there.
[241.10 → 247.92] The first article is Article 11, which will require websites to pay a fee to link to news
[247.92 → 250.68] publications or to use snippets from their articles.
[250.68 → 256.60] So if you're on Facebook and you see an embedded snippet or an embedded link to another article
[256.60 → 260.72] where you've got a little thumbnail image, a part of the title and maybe a description
[260.72 → 261.44] of the content.
[262.10 → 266.66] Facebook wouldn't be able to show that unless they paid some kind of license fee to the
[266.66 → 267.68] owner of that content.
[267.68 → 272.74] I think, yeah, it's pretty, like, it's ridiculous.
[272.90 → 274.76] As if, as if.
[274.76 → 275.26] That's difficult.
[275.34 → 279.82] As if Facebook is just going to spend all day, every day licensing all the different
[279.82 → 281.92] pieces of content that get uploaded to the internet that day.
[282.20 → 283.02] It doesn't make any sense.
[283.74 → 285.24] Check out this one quick thing.
[285.48 → 289.40] I just want to show, oops, how wonderful this is.
[289.58 → 293.42] We're able to stream, but I can't even like load web pages.
[293.48 → 294.18] Priorities, baby.
[294.34 → 294.50] Yeah.
[294.80 → 295.94] We got this though.
[295.94 → 296.12] Yeah.
[296.30 → 297.28] The stream is working.
[297.68 → 298.96] But I can't see the chat.
[299.10 → 303.62] So, you know, I am actually not 100% convinced that it's working, but it might be.
[304.36 → 304.92] I'm going to go.
[305.10 → 305.86] Hashtag pre-recorded.
[305.98 → 306.22] Yeah.
[306.36 → 306.52] Yeah.
[306.56 → 306.68] Yeah.
[307.28 → 308.84] I'm going to go with yes while this.
[309.20 → 309.64] Unintentionally.
[311.90 → 313.60] Apparently there's an exception in there.
[314.30 → 320.44] People were concerned about link tax where if you've got some text and part of that text
[320.44 → 325.92] is highlighted because it's a hyperlink, like check out our last review on this here that
[325.92 → 329.94] you wouldn't be able to have that here hyperlink without paying the tax.
[330.02 → 331.82] But I think there's an exemption for that.
[331.88 → 332.22] Okay.
[332.42 → 332.62] Yeah.
[332.62 → 333.64] Because that would just break the entire.
[333.70 → 335.10] That's what the internet's based on.
[335.24 → 336.84] That's what Google is based on.
[336.84 → 337.28] Yeah.
[338.28 → 338.48] Yeah.
[338.48 → 344.28] And there is another exemption that allows search engines to use your input snippets.
[344.28 → 345.00] I was just going to say.
[345.00 → 345.72] Because you still want to be found.
[346.00 → 346.28] Yeah.
[346.46 → 348.50] You want to be found because that's good for your bottom line.
[348.66 → 348.94] Yeah.
[349.08 → 350.78] But you don't want to be linked to.
[351.20 → 356.42] And you don't want to lift other platforms that are aggregators basically because they're
[356.42 → 359.36] just profiting off your content without paying you enough.
[359.36 → 364.40] Or like be used as an image sharing host when that's not where you're supposed to be, etc.,
[364.40 → 364.62] etc.
[364.82 → 365.12] Yeah.
[365.12 → 370.46] A big part of it is like the amount of money that a lot of music artists are not making
[370.46 → 372.74] from YouTube that they are making from Spotify.
[373.50 → 373.68] So.
[374.60 → 375.08] Okay.
[375.16 → 375.50] We're good.
[375.64 → 382.04] Opponents want these musicians just to renegotiate with YouTube and not kind of stain the whole
[382.04 → 383.70] internet with a shotgun blast.
[384.10 → 384.26] Yeah.
[384.40 → 384.62] Okay.
[384.68 → 387.22] So my webpage finally loaded.
[387.22 → 389.62] So Twitch chat people, there's the link.
[389.80 → 390.24] There you go.
[390.48 → 391.24] Sorry about the delay.
[391.40 → 391.60] Yeah.
[391.76 → 392.70] So there's another article.
[392.80 → 393.58] That's article 11.
[394.10 → 394.24] Yeah.
[394.44 → 399.70] Then there's also article 13, which requires websites to filter user submissions and check
[399.70 → 401.12] them against copyrighted work.
[401.18 → 406.86] That is so brutal and would just like to crush the forum and everyone's forum.
[406.98 → 407.28] Yes.
[407.28 → 407.32] Yes.
[407.36 → 407.60] Yes.
[407.86 → 413.38] Any online platform that allowed users to post text images, sounds, or code would need to
[413.38 → 415.64] assess and filter that content.
[415.64 → 416.60] What?
[416.60 → 421.80] Which has a bunch of brutal implications, which are nicely summarized by this like party,
[422.30 → 423.42] this pirate party of Europe.
[423.42 → 427.98] Every single UGC site, user generated content site would just be.
[428.46 → 431.42] This is exactly why, this is exactly why Wikipedia was protesting.
[432.04 → 433.28] Ah, because they are.
[433.48 → 433.80] Yeah.
[433.86 → 434.12] Okay.
[434.38 → 434.78] Exactly.
[434.78 → 437.02] They're even pretty good about like.
[437.10 → 437.58] Exactly.
[437.68 → 439.76] Making sure that everything's all okay.
[439.94 → 440.40] But like.
[441.66 → 442.88] Placing everything would be.
[442.98 → 443.88] So here's a list.
[444.74 → 446.22] Can I send this to you somehow?
[446.32 → 447.32] Can you click on this one?
[447.52 → 447.78] Which one?
[447.82 → 449.12] Source 4.
[449.12 → 450.22] Oh, this.
[450.22 → 450.60] Down there.
[450.76 → 451.28] Book book book.
[452.94 → 453.74] So I don't know.
[453.82 → 457.00] You might call this bias because this is definitely one side of the argument here.
[457.10 → 461.44] This is Julia Etta who represents the pirate party.
[461.66 → 462.24] The pirate pack.
[462.24 → 464.80] You can still find good information from.
[467.06 → 468.34] Knowing is always better.
[468.58 → 469.00] Go down.
[469.24 → 470.50] You can find good information from.
[470.58 → 471.22] Scroll down.
[471.36 → 472.32] Consequences list.
[473.02 → 475.28] Freedom of expression limited.
[475.66 → 476.10] Obviously.
[476.58 → 476.84] Yeah.
[476.96 → 477.52] Number one.
[477.64 → 478.80] Independent creators harmed.
[479.58 → 479.90] Yeah.
[480.58 → 483.68] And then there's all this like stifling of innovation and stuff because.
[484.90 → 485.18] Okay.
[485.24 → 488.04] Let's say you want to have a platform that gets user generated content.
[488.04 → 493.18] If you need to police that, then that either takes a ton of staff or it takes an algorithm.
[493.52 → 495.00] Both those things cost resources.
[495.42 → 497.48] So something like this just solidifies incumbents.
[498.40 → 503.24] And then bogs small businesses down in regulation that they just can't handle.
[504.06 → 504.22] Yeah.
[505.90 → 507.80] It's fascinating when.
[510.10 → 516.64] Putting a law into place is getting people to legitimately go to a pirate party website and be like, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[516.64 → 520.22] Like, like, but, but they don't necessarily agree with piracy.
[520.34 → 521.34] That's, that's an interesting.
[521.62 → 522.76] Check out this point.
[522.94 → 523.94] Surveillance risk.
[525.00 → 528.04] Due to high development costs for monitoring technology.
[528.04 → 529.70] This will likely end up.
[530.66 → 536.02] Like the technology would be outsourced to some major players who make that kind of thing.
[536.02 → 541.86] So that there would be a few large players who are the gatekeepers to everything that's being uploaded.
[541.86 → 546.30] So they have this data of what a large segment of the population is uploading.
[547.06 → 547.46] Yeah.
[547.50 → 548.60] That seems to go.
[549.92 → 550.32] Okay.
[550.36 → 553.86] It doesn't go against GDPR or GDPR.
[554.62 → 558.48] I always forget which way that goes, but it doesn't go against it.
[558.64 → 559.50] I think it's RP.
[559.62 → 561.08] I also have the same thing.
[561.32 → 561.62] Yeah.
[561.72 → 562.76] I always remember the GDPR.
[562.76 → 565.64] But after that, I'm like, it doesn't go against it.
[565.64 → 577.86] But I think it goes against the, the point almost because the, the, I think, I think the point is to try to reduce the amount that you're, you're monitored online.
[578.24 → 582.52] If you don't want to be on a certain website anymore, you can ask them to remove all your stuff.
[582.52 → 587.38] If you, your, those sites aren't allowed to keep your stuff for way too long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[587.38 → 594.00] And now it's just like filter everything, monitor everything, make sure everything is okay.
[594.36 → 597.44] Which again, it doesn't technically go against it.
[597.60 → 601.56] This would be allowed as long as it was disclosed and everything was okay.
[601.66 → 603.80] And you could delete it if you wanted, blah, blah, blah.
[604.26 → 606.90] But yeah, it's just weird.
[607.10 → 608.02] So it didn't go through for now.
[609.16 → 609.56] Yeah.
[609.56 → 612.54] The, the Wikipedia protest thing was a few days ago.
[612.76 → 617.02] I think it was on Thursday that they had their first vote, but it's not over.
[617.18 → 619.70] They're going to, they're basically going back to the drawing board.
[619.84 → 621.70] They're going to rework the proposal.
[621.78 → 628.86] And then all the members of European Parliament get to vote again on September 10 to 13.
[629.78 → 631.24] This is a nice long weekend.
[631.72 → 632.16] Yeah.
[632.20 → 634.00] They get to be in a cabin together.
[635.52 → 638.70] Also, thank you, Master Disaster for posting that on the forum.
[638.70 → 639.54] Yeah, that guy's legit.
[640.02 → 640.26] You all.
[640.40 → 643.18] A lot of people in the chat are saying that we look super saturated.
[643.78 → 644.96] We are super saturated.
[644.98 → 645.64] We're not though.
[646.18 → 646.50] What?
[647.02 → 648.90] I've been told by the people who set it up.
[649.78 → 651.52] It's not actually oversaturated.
[651.68 → 654.48] It's what the coloured light on the back wall looks like.
[654.74 → 654.84] Oh.
[654.88 → 658.98] I mean, that is a pretty, that actually does look pretty realistic to my eye.
[658.98 → 661.78] This is a blue light shining on this blue wall.
[662.00 → 665.34] That's a reddish pinkish light shining on that red wall.
[665.44 → 667.84] And then there's pink LEDs behind that red wall.
[667.84 → 672.90] So the walls just look crazy because they're blue and red and then has blue and red being
[672.90 → 673.72] shined on the blue.
[673.72 → 675.10] Plus Luke is just full of vitality.
[675.26 → 678.76] His rosy cheeks are actually just full of rose.
[678.90 → 679.42] Or, yeah.
[679.54 → 680.06] Rose blood.
[680.20 → 680.58] Bloody rose.
[680.58 → 681.30] I've never been outside.
[681.68 → 681.90] Yeah.
[683.08 → 684.20] But you drink your milk.
[684.48 → 684.76] Yes.
[684.92 → 685.12] Yeah.
[685.40 → 685.58] Yeah.
[685.58 → 685.68] Yeah.
[685.68 → 689.26] I'm getting various nodding and thumbs up from it.
[689.26 → 689.60] Is that right?
[689.60 → 691.20] Is everything good?
[691.94 → 692.98] I think it looks good.
[692.98 → 693.48] It's overexposed.
[693.62 → 696.48] But we think it's because the independent colours of lights on the colour.
[696.48 → 697.20] It looks fine on ours.
[698.68 → 698.96] Okay.
[699.10 → 703.72] I can't tell because we have a gaming monitor that is not colour calibrated at all.
[703.82 → 705.98] So I have no idea what it looks like.
[706.74 → 707.98] On all of ours it looks good.
[708.64 → 709.02] Okay.
[709.14 → 709.36] Cool.
[709.42 → 710.22] We're going with it.
[710.38 → 710.62] Yeah.
[710.92 → 711.64] It's fine.
[711.86 → 714.48] Best Buy is going to have this on their monitors on their showroom floor.
[714.76 → 715.88] On all their TVs.
[716.38 → 717.26] Look at this.
[718.50 → 719.72] It popped, baby.
[719.98 → 720.56] Oh, my goodness.
[720.58 → 721.52] That sells TVs.
[722.60 → 724.90] Speaking of look at this, best segue ever.
[725.08 → 727.46] Elon Musk apparently, for whatever reason.
[728.44 → 729.98] Saves the world and your children.
[730.86 → 732.44] From a cave that got flooded.
[732.80 → 736.92] So if you guys haven't heard of it, there's like, I believe it's a soccer team and their
[736.92 → 740.52] coach was just kind of exploring around for what, I don't know how this is.
[740.62 → 741.40] This ended up happening.
[741.64 → 742.44] This is in Thailand.
[742.78 → 743.02] Yeah.
[743.18 → 746.78] It's a soccer team of 12 Thai boys and their coach.
[746.90 → 747.06] Yeah.
[747.58 → 749.82] I don't know why they were doing this, but they were exploring a cave.
[750.18 → 750.74] That's cool.
[751.04 → 753.46] Outside, extracurricular activities kind of situation.
[753.50 → 754.34] They hung out too long.
[754.62 → 755.94] They hung out too long in the cave.
[756.20 → 756.76] It flooded.
[757.64 → 761.60] And they kept on getting pushed back further into the cave because as it flooded more and
[761.60 → 766.32] more and more, they tried to keep getting higher ground and getting to more air and
[766.32 → 766.80] all that kind of stuff.
[766.92 → 767.44] So they got stuck.
[767.70 → 768.56] God, that's scary.
[768.92 → 769.24] Oh yeah.
[769.46 → 771.26] Aren't they like 2.5 kilometres in there now?
[771.70 → 772.02] Really?
[772.28 → 772.84] I didn't know that.
[773.02 → 773.42] I don't know.
[773.74 → 773.94] Yes.
[774.00 → 777.44] Well, someone else I was talking to told me, Jake said they were like six miles in there,
[777.54 → 782.06] but the thing I read said two and a half K, which is a big discrepancy.
[782.16 → 784.72] But regardless, that's scary as man.
[784.72 → 787.60] Like just having to retreat deeper into this thing.
[787.98 → 791.48] So it sounds like at the very least the flooded sections is 2.5 K.
[791.48 → 796.92] Because it says it takes even the most experienced divers up to five hours.
[797.84 → 798.58] That's right.
[798.70 → 804.44] To swim through the 2.5 kilometres of jagged, narrow channels from where the...
[804.44 → 805.46] What?
[805.46 → 811.22] I guess you're not that many atmospheres down because you're like just barely under the
[811.22 → 811.46] water.
[811.72 → 811.96] Okay.
[812.30 → 813.28] It's gnarly, apparently.
[813.54 → 815.78] So they were reported missing on the 23rd of June.
[815.78 → 818.74] They were discovered nine days later by a pair...
[818.74 → 822.04] Days later by a pair of British divers.
[822.30 → 822.34] Yeah.
[822.68 → 823.06] Rescue divers.
[823.06 → 823.88] Who could do nothing.
[824.10 → 824.28] Yeah.
[824.32 → 827.60] They just showed up, and they're like, no, you can't come with us because it's too crazy
[827.60 → 828.50] of a dive.
[828.50 → 832.90] Like they have explored the possibility of getting the boys to swim out.
[833.40 → 835.44] But none of the boys can even swim.
[835.60 → 837.56] They don't know how to swim, let alone dive.
[837.90 → 843.82] And even if they were to dive, they're trying to get them a special like full face diving
[843.82 → 847.54] mask because normal respirators would probably just get ripped off because it's like super
[847.54 → 847.94] tight.
[848.54 → 852.86] So to explain the super tightness to these guys have to be...
[852.86 → 854.00] Well, they're master divers for sure.
[854.00 → 858.42] But they like would at a base level have to have the tech certificate because there's
[858.42 → 862.52] certain points where you can't have your air tank strapped to your back because you
[862.52 → 863.00] can't fit.
[863.76 → 869.64] So like I couldn't find if they had to like to run them by their side or if they had to just
[869.64 → 874.94] like go off-air for a second, throw the tank through, swim through, and then hook back up.
[875.04 → 879.16] I don't know what the situation is, but this is not at all a simple dive.
[879.16 → 886.34] It's advanced enough that tragically, either an ex-Navy SEAL or current Navy SEAL from Thailand
[886.34 → 887.98] actually did die.
[888.36 → 888.80] No.
[889.16 → 890.74] Diving, I think, on his way back.
[890.98 → 891.90] I didn't know that.
[892.22 → 892.80] That sucks.
[893.28 → 894.60] So, and there's a ticking clock.
[894.72 → 896.82] It's not like they can just hang out and keep bringing them food.
[896.94 → 900.76] There's a ticking clock because they're in the middle of the rainy season, which goes
[900.76 → 903.34] for like another three or four months until the end of October, I think.
[905.34 → 907.38] And there's rain forecasted for the weekend.
[907.38 → 909.08] Up until now, there hasn't been much rain.
[909.80 → 914.82] So the water is going to keep coming, and they're running out of places to go.
[915.04 → 917.48] In fact, they might be out of places to go.
[918.10 → 918.24] Yeah.
[918.78 → 918.92] Yeah.
[920.60 → 921.66] Wait, there's more.
[922.38 → 923.80] They're running out of oxygen.
[924.10 → 929.08] The oxygen in the chamber that they're in is down to dangerous levels, like 15% or something
[929.08 → 929.48] like that.
[929.74 → 934.70] So they had 10 rescuers with the boys who delivered food and stuff and their doctors and nurses.
[935.22 → 935.60] With the boys.
[935.96 → 936.52] The boys.
[936.52 → 940.24] And they got five of those rescuers just to leave because they're just sucking up too
[940.24 → 941.32] much oxygen.
[941.60 → 945.66] And they're like bringing oxygen tanks in to the chamber just so they can breathe.
[946.44 → 947.36] That's pretty wild.
[948.02 → 951.74] By the way, guys, I can't share screen right now because I have no internet.
[951.74 → 955.12] I'm going to try to go on.
[956.66 → 957.02] What?
[957.08 → 957.98] I can't believe this is happening.
[958.10 → 958.28] Look.
[959.12 → 959.84] Oh, good God.
[960.98 → 961.34] Okay.
[961.38 → 962.12] We're still live.
[962.16 → 964.12] Apparently, I can see it on my phone.
[964.46 → 964.64] Oh.
[964.64 → 966.44] I connected to LTE on my phone.
[966.44 → 967.36] I'm going to try to go.
[967.36 → 967.44] Oh.
[967.72 → 969.44] You look so natural.
[969.56 → 970.66] That's not saturated at all.
[971.90 → 972.30] Yeah.
[972.46 → 972.74] Whatever.
[973.04 → 975.28] So if they can't walk out.
[976.10 → 977.20] So they can't swim out.
[977.32 → 978.72] So they end up thinking maybe they could walk out.
[978.80 → 980.32] So they've been pumping water out of there.
[980.64 → 980.82] Yeah.
[981.10 → 983.08] But like freaking tons of it, right?
[983.42 → 984.44] Like millions of gallons.
[985.02 → 985.42] Yeah.
[986.18 → 988.16] And they've also been trying to dig down to them.
[988.32 → 989.70] They've dug over 100 holes.
[990.10 → 991.64] Some of them are 400 meters deep.
[992.06 → 995.34] And this is where Elon Musk comes in.
[995.72 → 997.04] For two of those things.
[997.28 → 1001.48] One, he thinks he can pump water out faster using some like Tesla battery operated thing.
[1001.48 → 1001.74] Yeah.
[1002.36 → 1008.10] And two, he's sending boring company engineers who he thinks they can dig better or at least
[1008.10 → 1008.96] help out in some way.
[1010.32 → 1012.40] So insane that he just got involved.
[1013.76 → 1014.74] He's like on Twitter.
[1014.88 → 1015.66] He's like, this is nuts.
[1016.00 → 1016.14] Yeah.
[1016.22 → 1020.46] So someone messaged him like, oh, can you help with this?
[1020.62 → 1021.40] Elon, help us.
[1021.40 → 1023.28] And he's like, I'll help in any way I can.
[1023.36 → 1026.80] And everyone just thinks that's like, oh, well, there's no way he can help.
[1027.12 → 1028.64] He's saying he'll help in any way he can.
[1028.70 → 1030.80] Maybe he'll donate a bit and move on and everything.
[1030.80 → 1035.06] He's like, I have access to the most talented digging engineers there are.
[1035.30 → 1037.22] I'm just going to, you know, ship a team over.
[1037.62 → 1039.66] We'll try to pump water out faster.
[1039.66 → 1041.40] And then this was my favourite one.
[1042.04 → 1047.58] He also discussed the possibility of inserting a nylon tube into the cave to fill it with
[1047.58 → 1049.26] air like a bouncy castle.
[1049.26 → 1050.02] That's a long tube.
[1050.30 → 1051.82] So that is a very long tube.
[1052.44 → 1054.08] It's 2.5 kilometres, presumably.
[1054.60 → 1056.18] And then they could just walk out.
[1056.44 → 1057.36] Hang out, boys.
[1057.58 → 1057.84] Yeah.
[1058.04 → 1058.58] Hang out.
[1059.16 → 1059.48] What?
[1059.48 → 1063.54] That still doesn't solve the water problem if they're at the end of it.
[1063.92 → 1066.14] If they're at the deepest chamber they can get to.
[1067.34 → 1067.66] Yeah.
[1069.60 → 1070.68] Maybe we can help out.
[1070.76 → 1072.24] Can we get some hardware in there?
[1072.32 → 1072.68] Have a land.
[1073.22 → 1074.24] They can have a land.
[1074.36 → 1075.04] And make a video.
[1075.12 → 1075.42] Yeah.
[1075.58 → 1076.22] They can have a land.
[1076.22 → 1076.58] Yeah.
[1076.82 → 1077.96] You can dive in there.
[1078.20 → 1078.66] Heck yeah.
[1078.90 → 1079.54] Hosted by Luke.
[1079.54 → 1080.46] I would die.
[1081.34 → 1083.66] If that Navy SEAL died, I'm screwed.
[1083.98 → 1084.96] Oh my god.
[1085.18 → 1089.00] I'm also a fairly large person, so these confined spaces sound like.
[1089.08 → 1092.88] Can you imagine these kids were in there for nine days, like before they even had contact?
[1093.12 → 1095.24] Having no idea if they were going to make it out.
[1095.68 → 1096.28] That's insane.
[1096.28 → 1098.92] Just drinking the rain water and not eating.
[1099.52 → 1101.92] They're like all super weak when they get found.
[1102.08 → 1102.52] Holy cow.
[1103.52 → 1107.38] So, prayers and thoughts and all that to those kids.
[1107.92 → 1109.48] At least they didn't beat each other.
[1109.54 → 1109.84] I'm pretty.
[1109.84 → 1111.70] I know that sounds insane, but that's like happened.
[1112.34 → 1112.62] Yeah.
[1112.72 → 1115.14] Wasn't there like a rugby team that got lost in the mountains or something?
[1116.18 → 1117.12] Like forever ago?
[1117.14 → 1117.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1117.54 → 1117.90] There's a movie.
[1117.98 → 1118.90] I think it's called Alive.
[1119.64 → 1120.74] Where there's like a plane crash.
[1121.74 → 1122.78] Something like that, yeah.
[1122.92 → 1124.12] They referenced it in The Simpsons.
[1124.22 → 1125.08] I saw it when I was a kid.
[1125.14 → 1125.74] That's all I know.
[1126.20 → 1127.46] But that's like, that was a thing.
[1128.80 → 1129.34] Anyway, yeah.
[1129.42 → 1130.42] More rain is expected.
[1130.96 → 1132.20] There are a bunch of different rescue teams.
[1132.20 → 1133.56] People from all over are trying to help.
[1133.74 → 1135.24] And this has been quite documented.
[1135.38 → 1137.66] So, if you want to learn more about it, you can check it out.
[1137.86 → 1138.32] But, yeah.
[1138.42 → 1141.68] Apparently, Elon is getting involved because that's the world right now.
[1141.78 → 1142.76] That's how that works.
[1143.14 → 1144.08] Something crazy happens.
[1144.22 → 1144.96] So, Elon shows up.
[1144.96 → 1146.40] I think they're going to make it.
[1147.42 → 1148.96] I'm pretty optimistic.
[1149.34 → 1152.14] I'm really sad that that Navy SEAL died.
[1152.40 → 1156.40] You can actually see footage from inside the cave where the original divers who found them
[1156.40 → 1158.12] took a video when they were speaking to them.
[1158.14 → 1161.02] And I think they even were like FaceTiming their families and stuff.
[1162.20 → 1163.58] Check it out.
[1165.24 → 1166.92] Maybe they're above the ground.
[1168.76 → 1174.64] There are places where water runs uphill right into the next topic.
[1175.10 → 1175.52] Uganda.
[1178.38 → 1179.18] All right.
[1179.24 → 1179.44] Yeah.
[1179.88 → 1180.44] Uganda.
[1180.66 → 1183.50] Social media is now a taxable activity.
[1183.50 → 1190.12] Let me take you on an internet spiral journey that I went on this afternoon when I was reading
[1190.12 → 1190.70] about this.
[1191.28 → 1191.36] Okay.
[1191.46 → 1192.50] So, first I went to like...
[1193.52 → 1195.90] By the way, this was posted by Duck Dodgers on the forum.
[1195.92 → 1196.62] Which is where I started.
[1196.80 → 1197.24] On the forum.
[1197.50 → 1197.62] Yeah.
[1197.78 → 1198.38] Thanks, Duck Dodgers.
[1198.38 → 1200.00] First, I get to learn about this.
[1200.48 → 1202.02] Social media is now taxable.
[1202.40 → 1202.74] What?
[1203.12 → 1210.60] So, it turns out that what the government has done there has told the ISPs that they must
[1210.60 → 1215.78] block users from going to certain sites, namely Twitter.
[1216.42 → 1216.86] Facebook.
[1217.52 → 1217.96] WhatsApp.
[1218.58 → 1218.92] WhatsApp.
[1218.92 → 1219.00] Tinder.
[1219.68 → 1220.70] And dozens of other services.
[1220.70 → 1221.50] Crucially, Tinder.
[1221.84 → 1222.08] Yeah.
[1222.08 → 1222.88] And a ton of others.
[1223.08 → 1225.56] They're blocked unless they pay this...
[1225.56 → 1226.82] It's not really a subscription fee.
[1226.92 → 1231.78] It's a per day fee of about five cents US, which is 200 shillings.
[1232.10 → 1236.36] I didn't know there are multiple African nations whose currency is called a shilling.
[1236.90 → 1238.32] That's Pirates of the Caribbean stuff.
[1238.82 → 1240.54] That's kind of cool.
[1241.00 → 1242.36] Maybe they have doubloons somewhere.
[1242.70 → 1243.10] Doubloons.
[1243.20 → 1243.90] That would be sweet.
[1243.94 → 1245.50] So, it's five US cents a day.
[1245.84 → 1247.38] I don't mean to belittle being sensitive.
[1247.62 → 1249.56] I never get to hear the word shilling.
[1249.90 → 1251.42] Anyway, I've already...
[1251.42 → 1252.40] I'm digging the hole.
[1252.50 → 1254.62] I'm going to reach those Thai kids with how deep I'm digging.
[1255.70 → 1256.74] This is getting worse.
[1256.82 → 1257.22] Yeah.
[1259.04 → 1264.40] So, it sounds like an insignificant amount of money to us, but keep in mind that there
[1264.40 → 1265.40] are...
[1265.40 → 1266.40] How many is it?
[1266.90 → 1271.24] Millions of Ugandans who survive on less than a dollar per day.
[1271.86 → 1275.94] So, for this to be five cents or like the per capita income is $600.
[1276.88 → 1280.68] So, a year this would be $1,900 if you paid the five cents for every year.
[1281.02 → 1284.98] There's also an incentive to sign up for a month in advance rather than paying per day.
[1285.24 → 1285.46] Okay.
[1285.46 → 1285.80] Okay.
[1286.30 → 1289.14] So, that sucks.
[1289.26 → 1291.94] And you think, okay, that's just the government trying to make some money.
[1292.00 → 1296.48] Someone in the chat, which I have to read off my phone because what the heck is going
[1296.48 → 1299.72] on, it says that Portugal is doing a similar thing right now.
[1299.72 → 1300.58] I hope not.
[1301.58 → 1303.52] But back on track, there's...
[1303.52 → 1308.82] It seems like it's like a money-grubbing, like the government's just going to...
[1308.82 → 1308.96] Yeah.
[1309.00 → 1312.22] It's just a new tax, and maybe they'll use it for a better internet infrastructure or whatever.
[1312.32 → 1314.10] But then I thought, wait a second.
[1315.50 → 1318.18] Countries like this usually have a high amount of disparity, right?
[1318.18 → 1324.30] So, when you see like the average per capita income, it's probably the case that that average
[1324.30 → 1325.66] actually doesn't represent that many people.
[1325.72 → 1328.64] There's probably a lot of people on the high end that boost the average and a lot of people
[1328.64 → 1329.34] on the low end.
[1329.46 → 1333.58] So, I thought those poorest people who live on less than a dollar a day, they're actually
[1333.58 → 1334.78] probably not affected by this.
[1334.78 → 1336.80] They're probably not the internet users.
[1337.16 → 1337.30] Right.
[1337.30 → 1338.80] Or they certainly won't be after...
[1338.80 → 1341.74] They are affected by this because they won't be internet users after this.
[1342.04 → 1344.68] So, then I thought, is this like a system of control?
[1345.82 → 1350.94] Is this like a way for people to not be able to go on Twitter, not communicate, not organize
[1350.94 → 1354.06] themselves, not have protests because they can't go on WhatsApp.
[1354.22 → 1355.62] They can't communicate with each other, right?
[1355.66 → 1356.06] They can't afford it.
[1356.30 → 1358.72] So, then I thought, ooh, this is kind of tin and Hattie.
[1358.72 → 1365.14] Let's Google Uganda dictator, tyrant, censorship, buzzwords.
[1365.60 → 1370.72] And so, I went, of course, I went to like their Wikipedia and there is a huge laundry
[1370.72 → 1377.62] list of things they've done in the past, including arresting opposition members, hiring gangs
[1377.62 → 1383.42] of young unemployed men to harass and oppress opposition supporters and politicians.
[1383.42 → 1390.50] And, critically, in February 2016, the government ordered the mobile service providers to block
[1390.50 → 1391.70] social media platforms.
[1393.00 → 1396.72] The government claims that platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp spread rumours
[1396.72 → 1398.52] and create unnecessary chaos.
[1398.92 → 1403.34] The opposition has argued that the ruling was put in place to prevent the public from reporting
[1403.34 → 1405.56] irregularities in the election process.
[1405.82 → 1412.32] And to note the opposition thing, Uganda's president is serving his seventh term right now.
[1412.32 → 1413.04] Yeah.
[1413.16 → 1417.04] So, apparently, like, the elections that they have are kind of fishy.
[1417.78 → 1418.22] Yeah.
[1418.70 → 1419.42] So, okay.
[1420.26 → 1420.82] Then I learned...
[1420.82 → 1424.42] Anytime you hire a gang of people to harass...
[1424.42 → 1427.62] Well, ostensibly, they were hired to keep the peace.
[1428.18 → 1428.94] Oh, yeah.
[1429.36 → 1429.74] Okay.
[1430.18 → 1430.58] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1430.58 → 1431.06] Ostensibly.
[1431.32 → 1436.38] So, then I found out that, actually, Uganda put this in place after neighbouring Tanzania put
[1436.38 → 1438.72] in similar things, which is the next topic here.
[1438.80 → 1439.14] Yes.
[1439.14 → 1440.68] They did it a little bit differently.
[1441.96 → 1443.04] What did they do?
[1444.08 → 1444.58] Oh, yeah.
[1444.70 → 1449.36] Ostensibly dubbed the Electronic and Postal Communications Regulations 2018.
[1449.62 → 1451.66] Not ACT or anything, just 2018.
[1453.28 → 1456.00] There was even a parenthetical thing that I took out of there.
[1456.12 → 1457.20] That's a huge name.
[1457.20 → 1462.72] But this basically requires online content creators, which includes traditional media websites,
[1463.22 → 1468.66] online TV, radio channels, but also individual bloggers and bloggers and, like, regular people,
[1468.84 → 1476.86] podcasters, to pay roughly 2 million Tanzanian shillings, which is 930 US dollars, in registration
[1476.86 → 1478.00] and licensing fees.
[1478.00 → 1483.56] So, if you want to create content, you have to, like, get, essentially, like, a business
[1483.56 → 1483.96] license.
[1484.06 → 1485.18] Like, yeah, that's a ton of money, man.
[1486.30 → 1487.28] I wouldn't do that.
[1487.66 → 1495.64] Even for, like, a more wealthy nation, where, like, your average person has more wealth per
[1495.64 → 1497.34] capita, that's still a lot of money.
[1497.34 → 1503.38] If you were, like, an American with 1,000 subscribers, which is hard to get, you might
[1503.38 → 1504.22] be like, screw this.
[1504.34 → 1504.64] Oh, yeah.
[1504.90 → 1505.08] Yeah.
[1506.56 → 1512.90] So, creators must not only pay these things, creators must store their contributors' details.
[1513.10 → 1514.76] So, let's say you started, like, a little news network.
[1515.16 → 1519.46] Whoever contributes to your site, you have to store that author's details for 12 months
[1519.46 → 1524.64] and have the means to identify their sources and disclose financial sponsors, which is,
[1524.64 → 1529.20] like, super Orwellian, like, transparency's sweet, but it's also kind of like, who are
[1529.20 → 1530.02] the detractive?
[1530.40 → 1530.58] Yeah.
[1530.58 → 1532.40] Who are supporting, who's supporting them?
[1533.66 → 1535.34] Cybercafes must install surveillance.
[1535.34 → 1541.64] Financial sponsors, I don't really mind that too much, but the, uh...
[1542.28 → 1545.48] Well, what's, what's involved in storing their contributors' details?
[1545.66 → 1546.64] No, that part, I do mind.
[1546.64 → 1547.82] Is that, like, their address and stuff?
[1547.94 → 1549.32] That part, I absolutely mind.
[1549.34 → 1549.68] What is that?
[1549.94 → 1554.62] But the like, disclosing financial sponsors, I guess it would come down to, uh,
[1554.64 → 1560.14] what details they want about the financial sponsors and how they have to disclose it,
[1560.20 → 1560.58] I guess?
[1561.32 → 1565.48] But being like, hey, we're paid by whoever to do whatever, I don't really see a problem
[1565.48 → 1565.86] with that.
[1566.72 → 1568.10] But the rest of it, yeah.
[1568.40 → 1571.22] Computers' details for 12 months, of course, that's not great.
[1571.66 → 1574.06] Cybercafes must install surveillance cameras.
[1574.06 → 1577.72] Yeah, and then there's all this vague language, like, failure to comply with the regulations,
[1577.90 → 1583.36] which also forbid online content that is indecent or annoying or that leads to public disorder,
[1583.36 → 1586.52] which is just, can be anything if you don't like me.
[1586.74 → 1586.90] Yeah.
[1587.42 → 1594.44] Uh, failure to comply with that is gonna result in a 5 million shilling or $2,200 fine.
[1594.78 → 1598.78] A jail term, a jail term of not less than a year or both.
[1599.74 → 1601.44] So you're screwed, basically.
[1601.56 → 1607.14] So there's already content creators, YouTubers and stuff in Tanzania who, who have given up.
[1607.14 → 1614.40] Yeah, so Tanzania's GDP per capita, like I was saying earlier, uh, $879 US dollars.
[1614.80 → 1620.26] So you wouldn't be able to afford, like, the average person there.
[1620.32 → 1620.60] In a year.
[1620.60 → 1621.70] Would not be able to afford.
[1621.92 → 1622.10] A year.
[1622.10 → 1622.58] A year's wage.
[1622.58 → 1623.32] A year's wage.
[1623.32 → 1623.92] Eminence alone.
[1623.92 → 1626.04] Let alone if you ever screwed up.
[1626.34 → 1628.68] That's over two years worth of income.
[1628.90 → 1629.12] Yeah.
[1629.24 → 1630.86] With no other expenses at all.
[1631.14 → 1635.52] One of their famous YouTubers called the idea that this is like a tax.
[1635.72 → 1638.72] The idea of using this as just like another form of taxation.
[1639.14 → 1641.72] A flimsy, a flimsy excuse.
[1642.06 → 1643.04] Is he just screwed then?
[1643.54 → 1646.16] Promoted by the government to restrict free speech.
[1646.16 → 1649.18] and wait it gets even
[1649.18 → 1650.00] interesting
[1650.00 → 1653.14] oh one blogger
[1653.14 → 1654.92] not necessarily a Tanzanian blogger
[1654.92 → 1657.10] no I think
[1657.10 → 1658.50] it actually was
[1658.50 → 1661.16] I think I wrote one blogger but in the story
[1661.16 → 1662.92] it actually is this particular woman
[1662.92 → 1664.28] well I'm worried about that person
[1664.28 → 1666.92] so it gets even crazier because they have
[1666.92 → 1668.54] their own like wiki leaks there
[1668.54 → 1669.76] the Swahili
[1669.76 → 1671.16] Swahili
[1671.16 → 1674.62] WikiLeaks site called
[1674.62 → 1677.06] Jami forums
[1677.06 → 1679.94] how do you say a word that ends in two I's
[1679.94 → 1680.66] Jami'i
[1680.66 → 1682.98] I don't know but
[1682.98 → 1685.32] they have this history of course
[1685.32 → 1687.46] people upload to their whistleblowing site
[1687.46 → 1689.30] and you don't disclose who uploaded it
[1689.30 → 1690.88] it's just like people in the know or whatever
[1690.88 → 1691.92] they're protected right
[1691.92 → 1694.98] well now this site has to disclose
[1694.98 → 1696.92] the details
[1696.92 → 1699.40] of the content creators who contribute
[1699.40 → 1701.90] definitely one of the reasons why they did that
[1701.90 → 1702.68] for sure
[1702.68 → 1704.86] yeah so now it's either
[1704.86 → 1706.92] well tell us who posted it or get shut down
[1706.92 → 1710.04] that's scary man
[1710.04 → 1710.90] pretty brutal
[1710.90 → 1712.92] I think I have internet again which is great
[1712.92 → 1714.46] and another thing
[1714.46 → 1716.10] where you can tell that it's
[1716.10 → 1717.24] calling it a tax
[1717.24 → 1717.94] is just ridiculous
[1717.94 → 1719.12] is that the blogosphere
[1719.12 → 1720.88] there is pretty small
[1720.88 → 1721.62] oh yeah
[1721.62 → 1723.26] so they wouldn't be getting a significant
[1723.26 → 1724.36] amount of money from it
[1724.36 → 1724.58] no
[1724.58 → 1725.32] it's just a
[1725.32 → 1726.54] just a means of control
[1726.54 → 1726.98] yeah
[1726.98 → 1728.28] scary stuff
[1728.28 → 1730.20] totally uh
[1730.20 → 1731.94] it's kind of similar to the European
[1731.94 → 1733.78] copyright directive
[1733.78 → 1735.88] but just completely different
[1735.88 → 1736.74] motivations
[1736.74 → 1738.38] but the end result is
[1738.38 → 1738.96] well that's like
[1738.96 → 1739.42] similar in a way
[1739.42 → 1740.74] I'm not going to delve on this for too long
[1740.74 → 1742.16] because it's not technology and stuff
[1742.16 → 1743.38] but have you looked into
[1743.38 → 1743.94] the
[1743.94 → 1746.92] things that were in addition
[1746.92 → 1747.74] in the
[1747.74 → 1750.08] so Canada recently passed a law
[1750.08 → 1751.20] is it 100% in
[1751.20 → 1752.98] I don't think it's 100% in for a little while
[1752.98 → 1754.90] but essentially marijuana is like legal
[1754.90 → 1755.52] and stuff
[1755.52 → 1756.98] and you can grow your own
[1756.98 → 1757.48] and blah blah blah
[1757.48 → 1759.52] most of the population up here
[1759.52 → 1761.02] seem to be fairly happy about that
[1761.02 → 1762.36] but also in that bill
[1762.36 → 1763.76] there were a bunch of other things
[1763.76 → 1764.84] uh
[1764.84 → 1765.34] like you're being
[1765.34 → 1766.96] you're now allowed to be pulled over
[1766.96 → 1769.04] without any form of cause or suspicion
[1769.04 → 1770.14] and like all this other
[1770.14 → 1770.94] oh I didn't know that
[1770.94 → 1771.24] yeah
[1771.24 → 1771.98] you should look into it
[1771.98 → 1772.48] it's pretty nuts
[1772.48 → 1773.40] um
[1773.40 → 1775.28] people are pretty upset about that
[1775.28 → 1776.26] and it just got passed through
[1776.26 → 1777.78] because everyone was just like
[1777.78 → 1778.42] oh yes
[1778.42 → 1779.30] a bill to make
[1779.30 → 1780.30] the weeds
[1780.30 → 1780.94] uh
[1780.94 → 1781.72] now legal
[1781.72 → 1782.76] yes I will sign
[1782.76 → 1784.16] and there's a bunch of other
[1784.16 → 1785.74] you must clean James' room
[1785.74 → 1787.74] ah
[1787.74 → 1789.84] you ever do that as a kid
[1789.84 → 1790.74] like you write a note
[1790.74 → 1792.16] and you get someone to sign
[1792.16 → 1792.68] and on the back
[1792.68 → 1793.02] it's like
[1793.02 → 1793.94] you must be my slave
[1793.94 → 1794.38] yeah
[1794.38 → 1794.82] yeah
[1794.82 → 1797.60] you just sold me our soul
[1797.60 → 1798.96] um
[1798.96 → 1799.96] not it
[1799.96 → 1800.40] anyway
[1800.40 → 1801.28] we should uh
[1801.28 → 1801.70] we should
[1801.70 → 1803.42] we should take a little intermission
[1803.42 → 1804.40] from the
[1804.40 → 1806.80] everyone's trying to be evil
[1806.80 → 1807.52] land show
[1807.52 → 1808.54] to our sponsors
[1808.54 → 1809.02] to
[1809.02 → 1810.82] to talk about sponsors
[1810.82 → 1812.38] fresh books
[1812.38 → 1813.24] fresh books
[1813.24 → 1813.72] so
[1813.72 → 1814.80] uh
[1814.80 → 1815.20] you know
[1815.20 → 1816.90] if you're trying to run a business
[1816.90 → 1818.68] in a country where you can do that
[1818.68 → 1819.54] um
[1819.54 → 1820.64] use fresh books
[1820.64 → 1821.46] it is
[1821.46 → 1822.82] a super simple to use
[1822.82 → 1823.58] invoicing tool
[1823.58 → 1824.90] that makes it so you can send
[1824.90 → 1825.64] uh
[1825.64 → 1826.80] invoices in like
[1826.80 → 1827.92] less than 30 seconds
[1827.92 → 1829.28] you can generate them super quick
[1829.28 → 1830.24] you can check to see
[1830.24 → 1832.06] if the person that received your invoice
[1832.06 → 1833.08] has actually read it
[1833.08 → 1833.68] uh
[1833.68 → 1835.14] you can track your time
[1835.14 → 1836.46] with their timesheet function
[1836.46 → 1837.72] you can manage your expenses
[1837.72 → 1840.22] to keep track of who owes you what
[1840.22 → 1841.58] which is actually super helpful
[1841.58 → 1842.62] um
[1842.62 → 1843.12] when you're
[1843.12 → 1844.30] when you're starting a new business
[1844.30 → 1845.62] especially a very small business
[1845.62 → 1847.64] maybe where you are the only person
[1847.64 → 1848.44] in the business
[1848.44 → 1849.34] um
[1849.34 → 1851.06] whatever your country calls that
[1851.06 → 1851.62] uh
[1851.62 → 1853.16] I think it's sole proprietorship here
[1853.16 → 1853.48] yeah
[1853.48 → 1854.00] um
[1854.00 → 1855.40] if you're running something like that
[1855.40 → 1857.06] these little bits of paperwork
[1857.06 → 1858.62] just creating an invoice
[1858.62 → 1859.82] checking to see if that person
[1859.82 → 1861.14] received the invoice
[1861.14 → 1861.88] checking to see
[1861.88 → 1863.08] who owes you what
[1863.08 → 1864.70] following up on all these different little things
[1864.70 → 1866.00] can take a huge amount of time
[1866.00 → 1866.98] so the fact that you can just
[1866.98 → 1868.38] generate one in 30 seconds
[1868.38 → 1870.86] the fact that fresh books can manage all your expenses
[1870.86 → 1872.50] and expense things for you
[1872.50 → 1873.58] can just take a picture of the receipt
[1873.58 → 1874.42] it handles the rest
[1874.42 → 1875.06] all that kind of stuff
[1875.06 → 1876.56] is actually super freaking helpful
[1876.56 → 1878.64] it also has a feature that tells you
[1878.64 → 1879.06] um
[1879.06 → 1882.24] oh I just read the same note again
[1882.24 → 1883.40] it tells you when uh
[1883.40 → 1885.48] clients look at their invoice for the first time
[1885.48 → 1887.44] so that you know that they've seen it at all
[1887.44 → 1888.60] if you have any questions
[1888.60 → 1890.24] and you feel that you need to reach out
[1890.24 → 1891.10] and ask their staff
[1891.10 → 1892.02] you can just do that
[1892.02 → 1893.60] and you'll speak directly to a real human
[1893.60 → 1894.52] there's no phone tree
[1894.52 → 1895.64] no escalations
[1895.64 → 1897.20] no return calls or anything
[1897.20 → 1898.76] you just talk directly to a person
[1898.76 → 1899.34] which is great
[1899.34 → 1900.32] god yes
[1900.32 → 1901.62] it's nice
[1901.62 → 1902.16] yes
[1902.16 → 1902.64] it's very nice
[1902.64 → 1902.98] uh
[1902.98 → 1904.02] visit freshbooks.com
[1904.02 → 1904.62] slash when
[1904.62 → 1905.36] and enter when
[1905.36 → 1906.66] in how did you hear about a section
[1906.66 → 1907.82] to sign up for
[1907.82 → 1908.78] a free
[1908.78 → 1909.72] trial

[1914.08 → 1915.22] P-I-A
[1915.22 → 1915.58] so
[1915.58 → 1916.10] I
[1916.10 → 1916.80] I believe
[1916.80 → 1917.38] um
[1917.38 → 1917.76] actually
[1917.76 → 1919.02] VPNs are currently
[1919.02 → 1919.90] uh
[1919.90 → 1920.88] attempting to be used
[1920.88 → 1921.64] in Uganda
[1921.64 → 1922.72] to get past
[1922.72 → 1923.36] the
[1923.36 → 1924.46] uh
[1924.46 → 1926.12] taxation of social services
[1926.12 → 1926.68] thing
[1926.68 → 1927.62] but now
[1927.62 → 1928.74] Uganda's trying to ban
[1928.74 → 1929.56] VPNs
[1929.56 → 1929.78] yeah
[1929.78 → 1930.44] but hey
[1930.44 → 1931.32] if you're a
[1931.32 → 1932.46] if you're a viewer from there
[1932.46 → 1934.86] you can use this for a little while
[1934.86 → 1935.04] yeah
[1935.04 → 1935.48] maybe
[1935.48 → 1937.42] until the ISPs ban it out
[1937.42 → 1938.92] a little quote from their president too
[1938.92 → 1939.48] being like
[1939.48 → 1941.52] it's actually more expensive to have a VPN
[1941.52 → 1942.52] than it is just to pay
[1942.52 → 1944.98] ugh
[1944.98 → 1946.78] yeah
[1946.78 → 1947.78] except you're a sketchy dude
[1947.78 → 1948.28] but whatever
[1948.28 → 1951.46] private internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols
[1951.46 → 1952.56] and types of encryption
[1952.56 → 1953.44] and authentication
[1953.44 → 1957.04] allowing you to dial in the exact level of privacy protection you need
[1957.04 → 1959.24] it supports apps for Windows
[1959.24 → 1960.02] macOS
[1960.02 → 1960.46] Android
[1960.46 → 1960.86] iOS
[1960.86 → 1961.78] uh
[1961.78 → 1962.80] in here it has Linus
[1962.80 → 1964.00] but I assume that means Linux
[1964.00 → 1964.64] uh
[1964.64 → 1965.70] and Google Chrome
[1965.70 → 1966.82] with support for several
[1966.82 → 1968.70] all the machines autocorrect to that
[1968.70 → 1969.46] yeah
[1969.46 → 1970.58] everything in the building
[1970.58 → 1971.46] I'm sure they do
[1971.46 → 1972.86] our personal phones have to too
[1972.86 → 1973.26] yeah
[1973.26 → 1974.86] it's a rule
[1974.86 → 1975.78] when you get hired
[1975.78 → 1977.58] you have to go into your like library
[1977.58 → 1978.46] speaking of tyranny
[1978.46 → 1979.42] yeah
[1979.42 → 1980.68] um
[1980.68 → 1981.68] check it out today
[1981.68 → 1982.66] in the link in the video description
[1982.66 → 1984.26] or just like here
[1984.26 → 1985.26] whoop
[1985.26 → 1986.14] whoop
[1986.14 → 1986.26] whoop
[1986.26 → 1986.86] whoop
[1986.86 → 1987.08] yeah
[1987.08 → 1988.18] I almost tickled you
[1988.18 → 1988.50] oh
[1988.50 → 1989.16] I was like
[1989.16 → 1989.54] EEP
[1989.54 → 1990.44] that would have been exciting
[1990.44 → 1992.20] it's too hot in here for that
[1992.20 → 1992.66] it is
[1992.66 → 1997.42] additional features of PIA include IP cloaking which sounds super sweet
[1997.42 → 2000.18] browsing anonymously which is sort of the point
[2000.18 → 2000.72] uh
[2000.72 → 2001.92] you can avoid data mining
[2001.92 → 2003.10] targeted advertising
[2003.10 → 2005.02] being blocked from social sites
[2005.02 → 2005.88] uh
[2005.88 → 2008.62] you can block unwanted connections which is cool
[2008.62 → 2009.60] advanced firewall
[2009.60 → 2011.68] you can unblock websites
[2011.68 → 2013.32] which is what uh
[2013.32 → 2013.96] I think a lot
[2013.96 → 2015.98] a lot of kids in school and stuff use it for
[2015.98 → 2016.98] uh
[2016.98 → 2017.68] because even
[2017.68 → 2018.76] I know some campuses
[2018.76 → 2020.52] if you live in the dorms
[2020.52 → 2022.68] and have internet to your dorm
[2022.68 → 2024.74] there are certain websites that are even blocked there
[2024.74 → 2025.84] and it's just like
[2025.84 → 2026.10] dude
[2026.10 → 2026.64] come on
[2026.64 → 2027.68] um

[2211.14 → 2211.44] oh
[2211.44 → 2212.70] sorry
[2212.70 → 2213.76] I'm really bad at this
[2213.76 → 2215.64] I'm going to be live-streaming parts of it
[2215.64 → 2215.94] so
[2215.94 → 2217.38] probably on Twitch
[2217.38 → 2218.12] so right here
[2218.12 → 2219.00] we'll be streaming
[2219.00 → 2220.18] not the entire event
[2220.18 → 2221.66] but we will do a few walkabouts
[2221.66 → 2222.34] and
[2222.34 → 2223.20] yeah
[2223.20 → 2223.96] capture a few things
[2223.96 → 2225.16] details on that coming soon
[2225.16 → 2227.36] I'm sure that'll be okay
[2227.36 → 2229.64] but no replacement for being there
[2229.64 → 2230.80] smelling us
[2230.80 → 2231.42] wow
[2231.42 → 2232.26] wow
[2232.26 → 2234.04] just getting your nose right up in there
[2234.04 → 2234.58] pheromones
[2234.58 → 2235.68] you can't actually detect
[2235.68 → 2235.96] but
[2235.96 → 2237.36] that influence your behaviour
[2237.36 → 2237.80] yeah
[2237.80 → 2239.50] you'll be forever changed
[2239.50 → 2241.84] by what you inhale at this event
[2241.84 → 2242.28] oh
[2242.28 → 2243.60] uh
[2243.60 → 2245.30] well
[2245.30 → 2246.08] you choose
[2246.08 → 2247.46] what do you want to talk about for the next 20 minutes
[2247.46 → 2248.26] I don't know
[2248.26 → 2248.84] I think
[2248.84 → 2250.28] is there anything happy
[2250.28 → 2252.12] is there anything that's like
[2252.12 → 2253.28] government does something
[2253.28 → 2254.90] that isn't crushing their citizens
[2254.90 → 2255.70] um
[2255.70 → 2255.98] well
[2255.98 → 2257.58] this is kind of neutral I think
[2257.58 → 2259.02] and I think we have to talk about it
[2259.02 → 2259.64] because it's pretty big
[2259.64 → 2260.94] many of you may know
[2260.94 → 2262.34] that earlier this week
[2262.34 → 2265.04] Facebook's hate speech algorithms
[2265.04 → 2265.86] yeah
[2265.86 → 2266.72] erroneously
[2266.72 → 2268.12] or maybe not
[2268.12 → 2268.90] erroneously
[2268.90 → 2269.82] uh
[2269.82 → 2271.40] they took down
[2271.40 → 2272.44] a post
[2272.44 → 2273.42] that contained
[2273.42 → 2274.64] a
[2274.64 → 2275.26] a
[2275.26 → 2276.26] excerpt from
[2276.26 → 2278.02] the American Declaration of Independence
[2278.02 → 2279.56] so
[2279.56 → 2279.90] yeah
[2279.90 → 2281.38] leading up to the 4th of July
[2281.38 → 2282.92] I forgot who it was
[2282.92 → 2284.08] there was a Facebook page
[2284.08 → 2284.84] in Texas
[2284.84 → 2285.94] that was
[2285.94 → 2287.14] posting snippets
[2287.14 → 2287.46] from
[2287.46 → 2288.50] the declaration
[2288.50 → 2290.44] so they broke it up into 12 different parts
[2290.44 → 2291.24] and every day
[2291.24 → 2291.50] they're
[2291.50 → 2292.74] they're uploading a part
[2292.74 → 2293.28] and I think it was like
[2293.28 → 2294.10] 12 days of
[2294.10 → 2295.00] independence
[2295.00 → 2295.64] basically
[2295.64 → 2296.52] and then on day
[2296.52 → 2298.12] 9 or something like that
[2298.12 → 2299.58] they got a message saying
[2299.58 → 2301.56] that your content has been taken down
[2301.56 → 2303.68] so the message didn't specifically say
[2303.68 → 2305.62] which content
[2305.62 → 2306.48] oh okay
[2306.48 → 2308.76] so it could have been any excerpt
[2308.76 → 2309.88] but they believe
[2309.88 → 2311.42] that it's this excerpt
[2311.42 → 2312.02] that contains
[2312.02 → 2313.10] if they're individual posts
[2313.10 → 2313.72] wouldn't they know
[2313.72 → 2314.80] because one of them just wouldn't be there
[2314.80 → 2317.98] it sounds like the easiest thing to figure out ever
[2317.98 → 2318.74] true
[2318.74 → 2320.48] you are a critical thinker
[2320.48 → 2323.40] they did eventually
[2323.40 → 2324.16] like apologize
[2324.16 → 2324.94] and put it back
[2324.94 → 2325.94] but
[2325.94 → 2328.10] the post that got flagged
[2328.10 → 2329.16] was this little part
[2329.16 → 2329.50] that
[2329.50 → 2331.36] refers to Native Americans
[2331.36 → 2333.12] as merciless Indian savages
[2333.12 → 2335.20] so
[2335.20 → 2336.42] you can
[2336.42 → 2338.10] you can check out the full quote
[2338.10 → 2339.42] by googling it
[2339.42 → 2340.88] or like looking on our doc
[2340.88 → 2342.92] my question to you
[2342.92 → 2343.58] Luke is
[2343.58 → 2345.34] should Facebook put it back?
[2345.34 → 2347.74] wow
[2347.74 → 2348.16] this
[2348.16 → 2349.68] okay
[2349.68 → 2351.60] that's
[2351.60 → 2352.12] okay
[2352.12 → 2352.72] one
[2352.72 → 2353.52] alright
[2353.52 → 2355.50] technically I am American
[2355.50 → 2356.62] some people know this
[2356.62 → 2357.04] I have
[2357.04 → 2358.72] passwords for both countries
[2358.72 → 2359.76] I was born in Canada
[2359.76 → 2360.24] I've spent
[2360.24 → 2361.28] every single
[2361.28 → 2363.10] residential day
[2363.10 → 2363.56] in Canada
[2363.56 → 2364.52] I've never had a residence
[2364.52 → 2365.16] in America
[2365.16 → 2366.08] but I technically
[2366.08 → 2366.76] have both citizens
[2366.76 → 2368.74] and technically
[2368.74 → 2369.22] I'm like
[2369.22 → 2370.38] sort of more American
[2370.38 → 2371.00] than I am Canadian
[2371.00 → 2371.54] because I'm
[2371.54 → 2372.30] technically
[2372.30 → 2373.66] a second class
[2373.66 → 2374.38] Canadian citizen
[2374.38 → 2375.44] meaning the government
[2375.44 → 2376.14] can deport me
[2376.14 → 2376.68] at any time
[2376.68 → 2377.24] for any reason
[2377.24 → 2377.82] without a trial
[2377.82 → 2378.22] yes
[2378.22 → 2378.92] watch it buddy
[2378.92 → 2379.36] great
[2379.36 → 2380.02] yeah
[2380.02 → 2380.82] I do
[2380.82 → 2381.88] have to watch it
[2381.88 → 2382.54] because I can
[2382.54 → 2383.28] be kicked out
[2383.28 → 2383.84] at any time
[2383.84 → 2385.86] but I have a full
[2385.86 → 2386.88] American citizenship
[2386.88 → 2388.18] not like a second
[2388.18 → 2389.00] class one or anything
[2389.00 → 2390.16] so I'm technically
[2390.16 → 2391.32] like more stable there
[2391.32 → 2391.88] even though I've never
[2391.88 → 2392.20] lived there
[2392.20 → 2392.62] it's weird
[2392.62 → 2394.70] but I didn't know
[2394.70 → 2395.76] that was in there
[2395.76 → 2396.60] that's a
[2396.60 → 2397.46] it's pretty aggro
[2397.46 → 2398.70] yeah
[2398.70 → 2399.76] it's fascinating
[2399.76 → 2400.22] because
[2400.22 → 2401.20] very aggro
[2401.20 → 2402.52] it's not like the
[2402.52 → 2404.06] like we've got
[2404.06 → 2404.60] another story
[2404.60 → 2405.06] that we'll talk
[2405.06 → 2405.60] about in a second
[2405.60 → 2406.54] where an algorithm
[2406.54 → 2408.02] kind of flagged
[2408.02 → 2408.54] something and it
[2408.54 → 2409.36] was obviously just
[2409.36 → 2411.02] not programmed well
[2411.02 → 2412.22] whereas this
[2412.22 → 2413.04] you could argue
[2413.04 → 2414.96] maybe should have
[2414.96 → 2415.60] flagged this
[2415.60 → 2416.72] but then because of
[2416.72 → 2417.52] the status of the
[2417.52 → 2417.92] document
[2417.92 → 2418.84] it's like well
[2418.84 → 2420.48] this racism is allowed
[2420.48 → 2421.78] because it's an
[2421.78 → 2422.54] important document
[2422.54 → 2423.78] well certain historical
[2423.78 → 2424.72] things right
[2424.72 → 2425.66] like it's like I
[2425.66 → 2427.12] this is weird
[2427.12 → 2427.80] we're going down
[2427.80 → 2428.62] a weird path
[2428.62 → 2429.30] for the land show
[2429.30 → 2430.58] this is not technology
[2430.58 → 2432.80] but I don't think
[2432.80 → 2433.60] history should be
[2433.60 → 2434.80] changed personally
[2434.80 → 2437.00] like I don't think
[2437.00 → 2438.58] a book should be
[2438.58 → 2438.96] edited
[2438.96 → 2440.64] that was published
[2440.64 → 2441.36] in the past
[2441.36 → 2442.58] because I don't
[2442.58 → 2443.14] think it's a
[2443.14 → 2443.92] because I think
[2443.92 → 2445.02] knowing mistakes
[2445.02 → 2445.74] that happened in
[2445.74 → 2446.28] the past
[2446.28 → 2447.24] is a valuable
[2447.24 → 2447.66] thing
[2447.66 → 2449.00] I think knowledge
[2449.00 → 2449.78] is more important
[2449.78 → 2451.64] than other things
[2451.64 → 2452.14] generally
[2452.14 → 2453.46] but then like
[2453.46 → 2454.02] I don't know
[2454.02 → 2454.46] just because the
[2454.46 → 2455.30] content isn't
[2455.30 → 2455.92] abridged
[2455.92 → 2456.52] does that mean
[2456.52 → 2456.90] that it should
[2456.90 → 2457.16] be allowed
[2457.16 → 2457.70] to be broadcast
[2457.70 → 2459.34] just because
[2459.34 → 2460.34] it isn't abridged
[2460.34 → 2461.32] like they don't
[2461.32 → 2461.80] post it
[2461.80 → 2462.28] and have part
[2462.28 → 2462.72] blurred out
[2462.72 → 2463.02] they don't
[2463.02 → 2463.70] change the book
[2463.70 → 2463.74] well the
[2463.74 → 2464.26] declaration of
[2464.26 → 2464.58] independence
[2464.58 → 2465.06] is still
[2465.06 → 2465.64] like is that
[2465.64 → 2466.36] that's still
[2466.36 → 2466.76] an important
[2466.76 → 2467.50] document right
[2467.50 → 2468.42] it's still
[2468.42 → 2469.14] an important
[2469.14 → 2470.16] government document
[2470.16 → 2470.58] yeah
[2470.58 → 2471.36] so I don't
[2471.36 → 2471.82] really think
[2471.82 → 2472.14] it should
[2472.14 → 2472.66] no I think
[2472.66 → 2472.78] it should
[2472.78 → 2473.08] be left
[2473.08 → 2473.36] alone
[2473.36 → 2474.14] so they
[2474.14 → 2474.38] should be
[2474.38 → 2474.56] allowed
[2474.56 → 2475.26] but is that
[2475.26 → 2475.56] the same
[2475.56 → 2476.04] as like
[2476.04 → 2476.42] leaving it
[2476.42 → 2476.58] alone
[2476.58 → 2476.80] is that
[2476.80 → 2477.04] the same
[2477.04 → 2477.60] as broadcasting
[2477.60 → 2477.96] it
[2477.96 → 2479.78] I don't know
[2479.78 → 2480.12] man
[2480.12 → 2481.24] alright so
[2481.24 → 2481.66] here's an
[2481.66 → 2482.36] easier one
[2482.36 → 2483.08] so personally
[2483.08 → 2483.62] I think
[2483.62 → 2484.54] they should
[2484.54 → 2485.14] be allowed
[2485.14 → 2485.72] I think
[2485.72 → 2485.98] it should
[2485.98 → 2486.60] depend on
[2486.60 → 2487.94] the context
[2487.94 → 2488.68] personally
[2488.68 → 2489.24] if I
[2489.24 → 2490.18] given the
[2490.18 → 2490.38] way
[2490.38 → 2490.68] so
[2490.68 → 2491.66] Facebook
[2491.66 → 2492.16] is its own
[2492.16 → 2492.72] private entity
[2492.72 → 2493.14] it's not a
[2493.14 → 2493.68] government thing
[2493.68 → 2494.02] so they can
[2494.02 → 2494.40] do whatever
[2494.40 → 2494.98] they want
[2494.98 → 2495.70] they could
[2495.70 → 2496.06] they could
[2496.06 → 2497.04] be like
[2497.04 → 2497.30] you know
[2497.30 → 2497.52] what
[2497.52 → 2498.20] no one's
[2498.20 → 2498.62] ever allowed
[2498.62 → 2499.14] posting that
[2499.14 → 2499.40] on this
[2499.40 → 2499.74] website
[2499.74 → 2500.40] and then
[2500.40 → 2501.00] people that
[2501.00 → 2501.96] believe in that
[2501.96 → 2502.26] strongly
[2502.26 → 2502.60] would just
[2502.60 → 2503.10] not use
[2503.10 → 2503.50] the website
[2503.50 → 2503.86] it's a
[2503.86 → 2504.14] private
[2504.14 → 2504.54] thing
[2504.54 → 2505.32] but
[2505.32 → 2506.96] with their
[2506.96 → 2507.60] stance on
[2507.60 → 2508.14] things in
[2508.14 → 2508.64] general
[2508.64 → 2509.50] I think
[2509.50 → 2509.86] it would
[2509.86 → 2510.50] depend
[2510.50 → 2511.20] on
[2511.20 → 2511.58] so this
[2511.58 → 2511.94] is again
[2511.94 → 2512.24] I just
[2512.24 → 2512.46] have to
[2512.46 → 2512.66] give an
[2512.66 → 2512.90] opinion
[2512.90 → 2513.26] based on
[2513.26 → 2513.50] what I
[2513.50 → 2513.70] think
[2513.70 → 2513.96] they
[2513.96 → 2514.18] would
[2514.18 → 2514.50] do
[2514.50 → 2514.88] because
[2514.88 → 2514.96] I
[2514.96 → 2515.06] think
[2515.06 → 2515.20] they're
[2515.20 → 2515.34] allowed
[2515.34 → 2515.56] to do
[2515.56 → 2515.74] whatever
[2515.74 → 2516.16] they want
[2516.16 → 2519.16] given
[2519.16 → 2519.52] their
[2519.52 → 2519.86] stance
[2519.86 → 2520.02] on
[2520.02 → 2520.22] things
[2520.22 → 2520.42] it
[2520.42 → 2520.58] would
[2520.58 → 2520.86] depend
[2520.86 → 2521.00] on
[2521.00 → 2521.12] the
[2521.12 → 2521.64] context
[2521.64 → 2522.76] if
[2522.76 → 2522.92] this
[2522.92 → 2523.20] person
[2523.20 → 2523.40] was
[2523.40 → 2523.72] like
[2523.72 → 2525.28] screw
[2525.28 → 2525.50] these
[2525.50 → 2525.76] people
[2525.76 → 2526.00] because
[2526.00 → 2526.14] it
[2526.14 → 2526.32] says
[2526.32 → 2526.54] this
[2526.54 → 2526.74] in the
[2526.74 → 2527.04] Declaration
[2527.04 → 2527.20] of
[2527.20 → 2527.54] Independence
[2527.54 → 2528.42] then
[2528.42 → 2529.16] that
[2529.16 → 2529.40] I
[2529.40 → 2529.80] think
[2529.80 → 2530.32] Facebook
[2530.32 → 2530.76] would
[2530.76 → 2531.02] then
[2531.02 → 2531.36] step
[2531.36 → 2531.54] in
[2531.54 → 2531.68] and
[2531.68 → 2531.92] want
[2531.92 → 2532.06] it
[2532.06 → 2532.30] taken
[2532.30 → 2532.64] down
[2532.64 → 2533.56] if
[2533.56 → 2534.12] they're
[2534.12 → 2534.36] just
[2534.36 → 2534.82] posting
[2534.82 → 2535.10] like
[2535.10 → 2535.34] this
[2535.34 → 2535.46] is
[2535.46 → 2535.62] the
[2535.62 → 2535.88] 12
[2535.88 → 2536.22] days
[2536.22 → 2536.46] until
[2536.46 → 2536.92] Independence
[2536.92 → 2537.14] Day
[2537.14 → 2537.60] we're
[2537.60 → 2537.70] going
[2537.70 → 2537.84] to
[2537.84 → 2538.22] slowly
[2538.22 → 2538.64] walk
[2538.64 → 2538.92] people
[2538.92 → 2539.20] through
[2539.20 → 2539.38] the
[2539.38 → 2539.74] Declaration
[2539.74 → 2539.90] of
[2539.90 → 2540.20] Independence
[2540.20 → 2540.48] because
[2540.48 → 2540.76] it's
[2540.76 → 2541.14] fairly
[2541.14 → 2541.70] long
[2541.70 → 2542.02] and no
[2542.02 → 2542.16] one's
[2542.16 → 2542.26] going
[2542.26 → 2542.30] to
[2542.30 → 2542.42] read
[2542.42 → 2542.56] this
[2542.56 → 2542.70] whole
[2542.70 → 2542.96] post
[2542.96 → 2543.06] in
[2543.06 → 2543.24] one
[2543.24 → 2543.44] little
[2543.44 → 2544.06] digestion
[2544.06 → 2544.38] thing
[2544.38 → 2544.74] but
[2544.74 → 2544.88] they
[2544.88 → 2545.14] might
[2545.14 → 2545.66] like
[2545.66 → 2545.78] it
[2545.78 → 2545.90] and
[2545.90 → 2546.12] share
[2546.12 → 2546.32] it
[2546.32 → 2546.76] every
[2546.76 → 2547.08] day
[2547.08 → 2547.62] as we
[2547.62 → 2547.78] go
[2547.78 → 2548.06] through
[2548.06 → 2548.58] and
[2548.58 → 2548.72] then
[2548.72 → 2548.86] they
[2548.86 → 2549.04] just
[2549.04 → 2549.34] happen
[2549.34 → 2549.50] to
[2549.50 → 2549.64] get
[2549.64 → 2549.76] to
[2549.76 → 2549.98] that
[2549.98 → 2550.30] part
[2550.30 → 2550.72] I
[2550.72 → 2551.66] personally
[2551.66 → 2551.94] think
[2551.94 → 2552.28] Facebook
[2552.28 → 2552.94] would
[2552.94 → 2553.12] be
[2553.12 → 2553.36] fine
[2553.36 → 2553.52] with
[2553.52 → 2553.74] that
[2553.74 → 2554.20] because
[2554.20 → 2554.66] I
[2554.66 → 2554.86] don't
[2554.86 → 2555.10] think
[2555.10 → 2555.34] the
[2555.34 → 2555.82] intent
[2555.82 → 2556.04] is
[2556.04 → 2556.28] there
[2556.28 → 2556.82] I
[2556.82 → 2556.92] don't
[2556.92 → 2557.08] think
[2557.08 → 2557.20] there
[2557.20 → 2557.34] was
[2557.34 → 2557.90] malice
[2557.90 → 2559.00] built
[2559.00 → 2559.26] into
[2559.26 → 2559.50] it
[2559.50 → 2560.08] I'm
[2560.08 → 2560.20] not
[2560.20 → 2560.36] even
[2560.36 → 2560.56] sure
[2560.56 → 2560.68] if
[2560.68 → 2560.80] there
[2560.80 → 2560.96] was
[2560.96 → 2561.24] malice
[2561.24 → 2561.40] maybe
[2561.40 → 2563.24] so
[2563.24 → 2563.50] here's
[2563.50 → 2563.58] an
[2563.58 → 2563.84] easier
[2563.84 → 2564.10] more
[2564.10 → 2564.32] cut
[2564.32 → 2564.40] and
[2564.40 → 2564.56] dry
[2564.56 → 2564.86] one
[2564.86 → 2565.42] I
[2565.42 → 2565.60] think
[2565.60 → 2565.72] that
[2565.72 → 2565.90] happened
[2565.90 → 2566.08] yeah
[2566.08 → 2566.50] same
[2566.50 → 2566.84] week
[2566.84 → 2567.44] Google
[2567.44 → 2569.08] AdSense
[2569.08 → 2570.14] decided
[2570.14 → 2572.72] that
[2572.72 → 2572.86] a
[2572.86 → 2573.12] webpage
[2573.12 → 2573.74] about
[2573.74 → 2574.08] a
[2574.08 → 2574.56] decades
[2574.56 → 2574.76] old
[2574.76 → 2575.16] bill
[2575.16 → 2575.88] about
[2575.88 → 2576.30] sexual
[2576.30 → 2576.80] abuse
[2576.80 → 2577.70] was
[2577.70 → 2578.10] adult
[2578.10 → 2578.56] content
[2578.56 → 2578.94] so
[2578.94 → 2579.26] and
[2579.26 → 2579.40] it
[2579.40 → 2579.72] decided
[2579.72 → 2579.90] that
[2579.90 → 2580.02] this
[2580.02 → 2580.40] webpage
[2580.40 → 2580.72] therefore
[2580.72 → 2580.94] should
[2580.94 → 2581.06] not
[2581.06 → 2581.18] be
[2581.18 → 2581.42] able
[2581.42 → 2581.86] to
[2581.86 → 2582.14] show
[2582.14 → 2582.40] ads
[2582.40 → 2582.68] anymore
[2582.68 → 2583.58] so
[2583.58 → 2584.02] the
[2584.02 → 2584.50] page
[2584.50 → 2584.84] which
[2584.84 → 2585.00] has
[2585.00 → 2585.12] been
[2585.12 → 2585.22] up
[2585.22 → 2585.36] for
[2585.36 → 2585.60] six
[2585.60 → 2585.96] years
[2585.96 → 2587.26] contains
[2587.26 → 2587.82] strictly
[2587.82 → 2588.82] legislative
[2588.82 → 2589.46] information
[2589.46 → 2591.08] it's
[2591.08 → 2591.20] just
[2591.20 → 2591.54] all
[2591.54 → 2591.92] legal
[2591.92 → 2592.36] stuff
[2592.36 → 2593.36] about
[2593.36 → 2593.56] a
[2593.56 → 2593.70] bill
[2593.70 → 2594.22] called
[2594.22 → 2594.68] the
[2594.68 → 2595.00] Child
[2595.00 → 2595.46] Sexual
[2595.46 → 2595.82] Abuse
[2595.82 → 2595.98] and
[2595.98 → 2596.42] Pornography
[2596.42 → 2596.72] Act
[2596.72 → 2596.82] of
[2596.82 → 2597.32] 1986
[2597.32 → 2598.36] so
[2598.36 → 2598.94] that's
[2598.94 → 2599.18] a lot
[2599.18 → 2599.30] of
[2599.30 → 2599.50] hot
[2599.50 → 2599.92] words
[2599.92 → 2600.42] and
[2600.42 → 2600.52] the
[2600.52 → 2600.78] algorithm
[2600.78 → 2601.02] was
[2601.02 → 2601.28] like
[2601.28 → 2601.74] this
[2601.74 → 2601.86] is
[2601.86 → 2602.12] bad
[2602.12 → 2603.68] blocked
[2603.68 → 2604.72] so
[2604.72 → 2604.94] then
[2604.94 → 2605.20] the
[2605.20 → 2605.78] person
[2605.78 → 2605.98] who
[2605.98 → 2606.28] runs
[2606.28 → 2606.68] this
[2606.68 → 2607.32] website
[2607.32 → 2607.60] which
[2607.60 → 2607.84] is
[2607.84 → 2609.18] govtrack.us
[2609.18 → 2610.62] which
[2610.62 → 2610.84] is like
[2610.84 → 2610.94] a
[2610.94 → 2611.24] legislative
[2611.24 → 2611.78] research
[2611.78 → 2612.10] and
[2612.10 → 2612.42] tracking
[2612.42 → 2612.84] website
[2612.84 → 2614.08] that
[2614.08 → 2614.66] person
[2614.66 → 2615.78] reached
[2615.78 → 2616.02] out
[2616.02 → 2616.20] to
[2616.20 → 2616.48] Google
[2616.48 → 2617.28] and
[2617.28 → 2617.52] tried
[2617.52 → 2617.62] to
[2617.62 → 2617.76] make
[2617.76 → 2617.88] an
[2617.88 → 2618.22] appeal
[2618.22 → 2618.54] to
[2618.54 → 2618.72] like
[2618.72 → 2618.90] get
[2618.90 → 2619.12] the
[2619.12 → 2619.30] site
[2619.30 → 2619.54] back
[2619.54 → 2619.74] up
[2619.74 → 2620.04] and
[2620.04 → 2620.36] right
[2620.36 → 2620.76] away
[2620.76 → 2621.56] got
[2621.56 → 2621.74] a
[2621.74 → 2622.34] response
[2622.34 → 2623.80] saying
[2623.80 → 2624.14] no
[2624.14 → 2625.08] denied
[2625.08 → 2626.00] the
[2626.00 → 2626.38] request
[2626.38 → 2626.54] to
[2626.54 → 2626.90] flag
[2626.90 → 2627.02] the
[2627.02 → 2627.26] page
[2627.26 → 2627.42] was
[2627.42 → 2627.76] denied
[2627.76 → 2628.88] and
[2628.88 → 2629.30] therefore
[2629.30 → 2629.46] they
[2629.46 → 2629.72] still
[2629.72 → 2629.98] can't
[2629.98 → 2630.12] run
[2630.12 → 2630.40] ads
[2630.40 → 2630.70] the
[2630.70 → 2631.28] site
[2631.28 → 2631.66] gets
[2631.66 → 2631.86] like
[2631.86 → 2632.22] 37
[2632.22 → 2632.56] grand
[2632.56 → 2632.70] a
[2632.70 → 2632.82] year
[2632.82 → 2633.00] from
[2633.00 → 2633.28] running
[2633.28 → 2633.92] ads
[2633.92 → 2635.48] it's
[2635.48 → 2635.64] an
[2635.64 → 2636.16] important
[2636.16 → 2636.56] site
[2636.56 → 2637.48] this
[2637.48 → 2637.90] particular
[2637.90 → 2638.36] page
[2638.36 → 2639.00] because
[2639.00 → 2639.18] the
[2639.18 → 2639.32] bill
[2639.32 → 2639.42] is
[2639.42 → 2639.54] so
[2639.54 → 2639.72] old
[2639.72 → 2639.94] doesn't
[2639.94 → 2640.06] get
[2640.06 → 2640.30] visited
[2640.30 → 2640.50] that
[2640.50 → 2640.70] much
[2640.70 → 2640.82] so
[2640.82 → 2640.94] it's
[2640.94 → 2641.08] kind
[2641.08 → 2641.18] of
[2641.18 → 2641.32] a
[2641.32 → 2641.90] drop
[2641.90 → 2642.00] in
[2642.00 → 2642.10] the
[2642.10 → 2642.28] bucket
[2642.28 → 2642.48] for
[2642.48 → 2642.66] them
[2642.66 → 2644.16] but
[2644.16 → 2644.74] if
[2644.74 → 2644.88] it
[2644.88 → 2645.84] wasn't
[2645.84 → 2647.84] so
[2647.84 → 2648.44] it's
[2648.44 → 2648.60] just
[2648.60 → 2648.80] funny
[2648.80 → 2649.04] because
[2649.04 → 2649.32] you can
[2649.32 → 2649.52] tell
[2651.56 → 2656.64] it's
[2656.64 → 2657.06] not
[2657.06 → 2657.28] really
[2657.28 → 2657.64] a
[2657.64 → 2658.10] manual
[2658.10 → 2658.42] thing
[2658.42 → 2658.62] right
[2658.62 → 2658.76] now
[2658.76 → 2658.94] it's
[2658.94 → 2659.06] all
[2659.06 → 2659.34] machine
[2659.34 → 2659.62] learning
[2659.62 → 2659.92] but
[2659.92 → 2660.82] still
[2660.82 → 2661.32] the
[2661.32 → 2661.58] machine
[2661.58 → 2661.82] learning
[2661.82 → 2662.16] algorithm
[2662.16 → 2662.30] was
[2662.30 → 2662.42] like
[2662.42 → 2662.56] you
[2662.56 → 2662.64] know
[2662.64 → 2662.84] what
[2662.84 → 2663.86] I
[2663.86 → 2664.04] hate
[2664.04 → 2664.52] it
[2664.52 → 2666.92] child
[2666.92 → 2667.38] porn
[2667.38 → 2668.58] Jesus
[2668.58 → 2669.30] yeah
[2669.30 → 2670.00] I'm
[2670.00 → 2670.10] not
[2670.10 → 2670.40] surprised
[2670.40 → 2670.62] it got
[2670.62 → 2670.80] picked
[2670.80 → 2670.94] up
[2670.94 → 2671.06] by
[2671.06 → 2671.28] something
[2671.28 → 2671.52] to be
[2671.52 → 2671.82] completely
[2671.82 → 2672.16] honest
[2672.16 → 2672.70] it was
[2672.70 → 2672.82] just
[2672.82 → 2673.02] funny
[2673.02 → 2673.18] how
[2673.18 → 2673.70] you
[2673.70 → 2673.98] can
[2673.98 → 2675.12] design
[2675.12 → 2675.72] and
[2675.72 → 2676.02] automate
[2676.02 → 2676.20] a
[2676.20 → 2676.56] system
[2676.56 → 2677.22] make
[2677.22 → 2677.40] these
[2677.40 → 2677.66] little
[2677.66 → 2678.12] tweaks
[2678.12 → 2679.08] and
[2679.08 → 2679.66] it
[2679.66 → 2679.84] just
[2679.84 → 2680.54] propagates
[2680.54 → 2680.66] and
[2680.66 → 2681.06] affects
[2681.06 → 2681.44] so
[2681.44 → 2681.76] many
[2681.76 → 2682.20] people
[2682.20 → 2682.96] and
[2682.96 → 2683.36] affects
[2683.36 → 2683.66] their
[2683.66 → 2684.04] bottom
[2684.04 → 2684.52] line
[2684.52 → 2685.58] and
[2685.58 → 2685.88] affects
[2685.88 → 2686.06] their
[2686.06 → 2686.74] livelihood
[2686.74 → 2688.56] but
[2688.56 → 2688.72] it's
[2688.72 → 2689.12] necessary
[2689.12 → 2689.58] because
[2689.58 → 2690.10] you
[2690.10 → 2690.30] just
[2690.30 → 2690.64] can't
[2690.64 → 2690.84] have
[2690.84 → 2691.16] humans
[2691.16 → 2691.40] going
[2691.40 → 2691.60] through
[2691.60 → 2691.74] all
[2691.74 → 2691.90] these
[2691.90 → 2692.12] things
[2692.12 → 2692.38] it's
[2692.38 → 2692.54] just
[2692.54 → 2692.70] too
[2692.70 → 2692.98] much
[2692.98 → 2693.64] content
[2693.64 → 2694.44] we should
[2694.44 → 2694.56] have
[2694.56 → 2694.82] less
[2694.82 → 2695.30] content
[2695.30 → 2695.62] on the
[2695.62 → 2695.82] internet
[2695.82 → 2696.30] wait
[2696.30 → 2696.88] a second
[2696.88 → 2698.48] these
[2698.48 → 2699.04] Tanzanians
[2699.04 → 2699.42] are on to
[2699.42 → 2699.76] something
[2699.76 → 2700.46] we're making
[2700.46 → 2700.86] content
[2700.86 → 2701.26] right now
[2701.26 → 2701.48] man
[2701.48 → 2702.38] don't kill
[2702.38 → 2702.66] our own
[2702.66 → 2702.98] jobs
[2702.98 → 2703.70] speaking
[2703.70 → 2704.08] of
[2704.08 → 2705.34] nothing
[2705.34 → 2705.98] because
[2705.98 → 2706.46] there's
[2706.46 → 2706.66] no
[2706.66 → 2706.92] segue
[2706.92 → 2707.40] for this
[2707.40 → 2707.78] we're
[2707.78 → 2708.36] finally
[2708.36 → 2708.96] some
[2708.96 → 2710.56] news
[2710.56 → 2710.80] that you
[2710.80 → 2710.96] guys
[2710.96 → 2711.08] are
[2711.08 → 2711.38] probably
[2711.38 → 2711.92] very
[2711.92 → 2712.42] directly
[2712.42 → 2712.80] interested
[2712.80 → 2713.14] in
[2713.14 → 2713.82] AMD
[2713.82 → 2714.60] B450
[2714.60 → 2715.32] boards
[2715.32 → 2715.84] are coming
[2715.84 → 2716.26] out
[2716.26 → 2716.64] speaking
[2716.64 → 2716.82] of
[2716.82 → 2716.94] a
[2716.94 → 2717.70] board
[2717.70 → 2719.68] which
[2719.68 → 2721.18] anyway
[2721.18 → 2722.00] AMD
[2722.00 → 2722.78] has still
[2722.78 → 2723.56] not formally
[2723.56 → 2724.04] announced
[2724.04 → 2724.70] the B450
[2724.70 → 2725.50] chipset
[2725.50 → 2726.36] but pre-orders
[2726.36 → 2726.98] and listings
[2726.98 → 2727.62] for B450
[2727.62 → 2728.20] boards
[2728.20 → 2729.00] from three
[2729.00 → 2729.54] major
[2729.54 → 2730.08] motherboard
[2730.08 → 2730.74] manufacturers
[2730.74 → 2731.56] have already
[2731.56 → 2732.28] appeared in
[2732.28 → 2732.84] Austria
[2732.84 → 2733.98] and Germany
[2733.98 → 2735.12] some stores
[2735.12 → 2735.50] list
[2735.50 → 2735.94] some of
[2735.94 → 2736.06] these
[2736.06 → 2736.52] motherboards
[2736.52 → 2736.94] as in
[2736.94 → 2737.44] stock
[2737.44 → 2738.06] but also
[2738.06 → 2738.36] note
[2738.36 → 2738.64] that the
[2738.64 → 2738.94] product
[2738.94 → 2739.24] will be
[2739.24 → 2739.52] ordered
[2739.52 → 2739.94] from their
[2739.94 → 2740.32] warehouse
[2740.32 → 2740.98] or distributor
[2740.98 → 2741.98] after an
[2741.98 → 2742.50] order is
[2742.50 → 2742.90] placed
[2742.90 → 2743.24] which is
[2743.24 → 2743.56] essentially
[2743.56 → 2743.86] like
[2743.86 → 2744.32] they're
[2744.32 → 2744.54] saying
[2744.54 → 2744.86] that they
[2744.86 → 2745.80] have
[2745.80 → 2746.80] that store
[2746.80 → 2747.42] is confirming
[2747.42 → 2747.72] that they
[2747.72 → 2748.48] have availability
[2748.48 → 2749.14] it's not in
[2749.14 → 2749.70] that store's
[2749.70 → 2750.32] own warehouse
[2750.32 → 2750.74] but their
[2750.74 → 2751.24] distributor
[2751.24 → 2752.00] has some
[2752.00 → 2752.22] and they
[2752.22 → 2752.46] can get
[2752.46 → 2752.74] it from
[2752.74 → 2752.98] them
[2752.98 → 2753.44] but it
[2753.44 → 2753.66] still
[2753.66 → 2754.12] implies
[2754.12 → 2754.42] that you're
[2754.42 → 2754.52] going to
[2754.52 → 2754.66] be able
[2754.66 → 2754.84] to get
[2754.84 → 2755.30] it in
[2755.30 → 2755.64] a few
[2755.64 → 2756.12] days
[2756.12 → 2756.72] soon
[2756.72 → 2757.08] that
[2757.08 → 2757.64] makes
[2757.64 → 2758.04] it seems
[2758.04 → 2758.34] like this
[2758.34 → 2758.74] announcement
[2758.74 → 2759.06] is going
[2759.06 → 2759.30] to be
[2759.30 → 2760.48] really
[2760.48 → 2761.76] yeah
[2761.76 → 2762.42] the ASUS
[2762.42 → 2763.02] Prime
[2763.02 → 2765.00] B450M-A
[2765.00 → 2765.76] seems to be
[2765.76 → 2766.12] available
[2766.12 → 2766.86] immediately
[2766.86 → 2767.80] and many
[2767.80 → 2768.12] of the
[2768.12 → 2768.36] boards
[2768.36 → 2769.04] don't appear
[2769.04 → 2769.34] on the
[2769.34 → 2770.10] manufacturer's
[2770.10 → 2770.58] websites
[2770.58 → 2770.84] yet
[2770.84 → 2771.32] which is
[2771.32 → 2772.22] weird
[2772.22 → 2773.42] it could
[2773.42 → 2773.82] be
[2773.82 → 2774.80] a retail
[2774.80 → 2775.18] leak
[2775.18 → 2775.88] which happens
[2775.88 → 2776.42] sometimes
[2776.42 → 2777.32] but it
[2777.32 → 2777.60] seems
[2777.60 → 2778.30] fairly unlikely
[2778.30 → 2778.80] my question
[2778.80 → 2779.16] is why
[2779.16 → 2779.56] do these
[2779.56 → 2779.82] kind of
[2779.82 → 2780.34] things always
[2780.34 → 2780.72] seem to
[2780.72 → 2781.06] happen in
[2781.06 → 2781.36] Germany
[2781.36 → 2783.02] in Austria
[2783.02 → 2783.42] yeah
[2783.42 → 2783.98] that happened
[2783.98 → 2784.28] not that
[2784.28 → 2784.68] long ago
[2784.68 → 2784.86] too
[2784.86 → 2785.14] always
[2785.14 → 2785.50] Germany
[2785.50 → 2785.98] there's always
[2785.98 → 2786.26] like these
[2786.26 → 2786.92] German sites
[2786.92 → 2787.44] I'm always
[2787.44 → 2788.04] translating
[2788.04 → 2789.36] webpages
[2789.36 → 2790.12] yeah
[2790.12 → 2791.48] I don't
[2791.48 → 2791.70] know
[2791.70 → 2792.26] I mean
[2792.26 → 2792.78] wasn't it
[2792.78 → 2793.38] like Walmart
[2793.38 → 2793.98] Canada
[2793.98 → 2794.60] that leaked
[2794.60 → 2795.04] all of
[2795.04 → 2795.66] Bethesda's
[2795.66 → 2796.36] E3 stuff
[2796.36 → 2797.66] I don't
[2797.66 → 2797.92] remember
[2797.92 → 2798.08] what
[2798.08 → 2798.40] like
[2798.40 → 2800.02] what
[2800.02 → 2801.32] was it
[2801.32 → 2803.18] I can't
[2803.18 → 2803.38] remember the
[2803.38 → 2803.52] name
[2803.52 → 2804.34] post-apocalyptic
[2804.34 → 2805.22] Fallout
[2805.22 → 2805.80] no
[2805.80 → 2806.94] that makes
[2806.94 → 2807.14] sense
[2807.14 → 2807.64] but no
[2807.64 → 2808.88] Rage
[2808.88 → 2809.50] Rage
[2809.50 → 2810.16] Rage 2
[2810.16 → 2811.14] is it Rage
[2811.14 → 2813.02] Rage
[2813.02 → 2813.62] Carry 2
[2813.62 → 2815.26] do you remember
[2815.26 → 2815.72] that
[2815.72 → 2817.04] Rage Carry 2
[2817.04 → 2817.72] yeah it was a
[2817.72 → 2818.42] movie it was the
[2818.42 → 2819.16] sequel to Carry
[2819.16 → 2819.86] oh
[2819.86 → 2820.42] it came out in
[2820.42 → 2820.84] like the late
[2820.84 → 2821.40] 90s or
[2821.40 → 2821.76] 2000
[2821.76 → 2823.20] yeah Rage 2
[2823.20 → 2824.26] was a
[2824.26 → 2825.34] no mic
[2825.34 → 2827.54] it's just one
[2827.54 → 2828.32] person spamming
[2828.32 → 2828.92] no mic but
[2828.92 → 2829.62] everyone seems to
[2829.62 → 2830.48] be hearing what
[2830.48 → 2830.98] I'm saying
[2830.98 → 2832.18] he's right
[2832.18 → 2833.30] you're Luke
[2833.30 → 2833.96] and I'm James
[2833.96 → 2835.02] there's no
[2835.02 → 2835.50] mics here
[2835.50 → 2836.34] yeah none
[2836.34 → 2836.98] there is
[2836.98 → 2838.02] absolutely no
[2838.02 → 2838.84] not a single
[2838.84 → 2839.14] mic
[2839.14 → 2840.26] but yeah
[2840.26 → 2841.84] Bethesda's Rage 2
[2841.84 → 2842.70] was leaked by
[2842.70 → 2843.60] Walmart somewhere
[2843.60 → 2844.24] I'm not necessarily
[2844.24 → 2844.62] sure where
[2844.62 → 2845.18] oh we're on the
[2845.18 → 2845.66] wrong banner
[2845.66 → 2846.30] whatever
[2846.30 → 2846.80] it's not like
[2846.80 → 2847.28] that sponsor
[2847.28 → 2847.62] is going to be
[2847.62 → 2848.26] too mad at us
[2848.26 → 2851.70] yeah so
[2851.70 → 2852.54] I don't know
[2852.54 → 2852.92] that's
[2852.92 → 2853.60] that's cool
[2853.60 → 2854.20] more
[2854.20 → 2855.60] more AMD boards
[2855.60 → 2856.08] coming
[2856.08 → 2857.08] Sonos files
[2857.08 → 2857.82] for initial
[2857.82 → 2858.68] public offering
[2858.68 → 2860.28] they filed
[2860.28 → 2860.82] with an offering
[2860.82 → 2861.50] size of 100
[2861.50 → 2862.46] million dollars
[2862.46 → 2863.38] a placeholder
[2863.38 → 2864.02] amount used to
[2864.02 → 2864.90] calculate fees
[2864.90 → 2865.44] that is likely
[2865.44 → 2866.02] to change
[2866.02 → 2866.58] I don't know
[2866.58 → 2867.36] would you buy
[2867.36 → 2868.08] Sonos stock
[2868.08 → 2868.84] off the bat
[2868.84 → 2871.90] because of that
[2871.90 → 2872.46] thing I mentioned
[2872.46 → 2873.38] earlier I can't
[2873.38 → 2873.98] really invest in
[2873.98 → 2874.42] stock market
[2874.42 → 2875.02] because both
[2875.02 → 2875.58] countries want to
[2875.58 → 2875.96] tax me
[2875.96 → 2876.88] so who knows
[2876.88 → 2878.78] if I could
[2878.78 → 2880.30] I would want to
[2880.30 → 2880.82] do way more
[2880.82 → 2881.60] research into them
[2881.60 → 2882.34] because I don't
[2882.34 → 2883.18] know enough
[2883.18 → 2883.80] about them right
[2883.80 → 2884.74] now I would not
[2884.74 → 2885.26] feel comfortable
[2885.26 → 2886.42] right now but I
[2886.42 → 2886.78] would want to do
[2886.78 → 2887.18] more research
[2887.18 → 2888.32] it seems like
[2888.32 → 2890.34] Apple and Google
[2890.34 → 2891.16] are trying to
[2891.16 → 2891.96] very aggressively
[2891.96 → 2892.66] take over that
[2892.66 → 2893.74] space and neither
[2893.74 → 2894.36] of them seems to
[2894.36 → 2895.32] be buying Sonos
[2895.32 → 2896.76] right now so I
[2896.76 → 2897.50] would be concerned
[2897.50 → 2898.24] well that's the
[2898.24 → 2898.68] interesting part
[2898.68 → 2900.08] about it is they
[2900.08 → 2901.16] are going public
[2901.16 → 2902.08] almost because of
[2902.08 → 2902.92] that because of
[2902.92 → 2903.42] the competition
[2903.42 → 2904.12] in the space
[2904.12 → 2906.32] they need money
[2906.32 → 2907.92] and remember
[2907.92 → 2908.56] having a public
[2908.56 → 2909.34] offering is a
[2909.34 → 2910.90] fundraising activity
[2910.90 → 2914.96] essentially so I
[2914.96 → 2915.46] don't know I don't
[2915.46 → 2915.92] think I would
[2915.92 → 2918.52] yeah they're in a
[2918.52 → 2919.14] weird spot right
[2919.14 → 2920.38] now but what's
[2920.38 → 2921.04] cool about their
[2921.04 → 2921.92] stuff though is
[2921.92 → 2923.30] later this year on
[2923.30 → 2923.98] their Sonos beam
[2923.98 → 2924.54] which just came out
[2924.54 → 2925.04] which is a sound
[2925.04 → 2926.52] bar it has the
[2926.52 → 2927.74] it has Alexa right
[2927.74 → 2928.66] now, and they're
[2928.66 → 2929.62] soon it's going to
[2929.62 → 2931.00] have Alexa and
[2931.00 → 2931.64] Google Assistant
[2931.64 → 2932.94] on the same
[2932.94 → 2935.12] device which I've
[2935.12 → 2935.88] never seen I
[2935.88 → 2936.96] don't think I don't
[2936.96 → 2937.32] think there's a
[2937.32 → 2937.96] device out there that
[2937.96 → 2938.94] has that be pretty
[2938.94 → 2939.84] cool there's to hail
[2939.84 → 2941.22] one assistant for one
[2941.22 → 2942.50] task and then just
[2942.50 → 2944.14] hail that hail a
[2944.14 → 2945.20] different assistant
[2945.20 → 2946.28] there is quite a few
[2946.28 → 2946.74] things that the
[2946.74 → 2947.56] overlap isn't very
[2947.56 → 2948.64] good yeah like
[2948.64 → 2949.64] there 's's there's
[2949.64 → 2951.02] in the Venn diagram
[2951.02 → 2952.10] there is definitely the
[2952.10 → 2953.20] outer circles yeah
[2953.20 → 2954.18] they're also going to
[2954.18 → 2956.66] be supporting Siri but
[2956.66 → 2958.78] I didn't read
[2958.78 → 2959.74] specifically that
[2959.74 → 2960.52] Siri is going to be on
[2960.52 → 2961.32] the same device as
[2961.32 → 2962.08] these other assistants
[2962.08 → 2963.88] okay and I wouldn't
[2963.88 → 2964.86] be surprised if there
[2964.86 → 2965.82] was like the Apple
[2965.82 → 2966.66] model and then the
[2966.66 → 2967.60] everyone else model
[2967.60 → 2968.80] because I don't see
[2968.80 → 2970.18] Apple wanting Siri to
[2970.18 → 2970.94] be on the same device
[2970.94 → 2971.62] as Google Assistant
[2971.62 → 2973.64] it's just too much
[2973.64 → 2974.56] room for people to be
[2974.56 → 2976.50] like hey you answer
[2976.50 → 2977.86] this question hey you
[2977.86 → 2979.30] fail at answering the
[2979.30 → 2981.08] same question right
[2981.08 → 2982.24] side by side yeah
[2982.24 → 2987.70] speaking of I'm just
[2987.70 → 2988.70] going to go hey you
[2988.70 → 2990.88] Seagate I don't know
[2990.88 → 2992.10] Seagate announces a
[2992.10 → 2993.92] mainstream SSD drive
[2993.92 → 2995.02] that's pretty neat the
[2995.02 → 2996.00] the smallest model is going
[2996.00 → 2998.92] for $74 which I believe
[2998.92 → 3001.30] is 250 gigs and the
[3001.30 → 3003.18] one terabyte model is on
[3003.18 → 3004.24] sale for $299
[3004.24 → 3008.38] how about them steam
[3008.38 → 3008.76] leaks
