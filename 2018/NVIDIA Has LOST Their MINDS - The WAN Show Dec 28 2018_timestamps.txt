This thing needs more structure, provide timestamp and topic covered please. I'm not going to sit through 1 hour waiting to find out why NVidia lost their mind and listening to why you're tired and had to buy too many presents. I like your other more focused videos though, but this is just crap.

Do we even need timestamps anymore? It's like 2-3 topic per episode lol
