[0.00 --> 8.08]  yeah and we're back back at you with another weigh-in show how's it going hope your day's
[8.08 --> 13.68]  been great we got some news for you such news intel invests a billion dollars to meet 14
[13.68 --> 21.68]  nanometer demand this year billion dollars also the amazon anti-union video has leaked they sent
[21.68 --> 28.08]  it to whole foods or something controversial elon musk getting sued not by some little
[28.08 --> 34.96]  backyard yokel either by the sec securities and exchange commission because you know he's been
[34.96 --> 41.28]  fraudulent yeah we'll get into that no sex no drugs no violence no money from me then
[42.64 --> 47.04]  on apple's streaming service we'll talk about that later as well it's time for the intro
[48.96 --> 49.60]  oh man
[58.96 --> 61.68]  ohh Chris
[66.08 --> 83.92]  remember soundboard
[83.92 --> 89.06]  so bad to the people who are getting called if you have the soundboard you're sitting there you
[89.06 --> 94.50]  got your computer speaker up to the phone you're just going hi how are you i'm a copy with you
[94.50 --> 98.46]  and the person you're losing it you're losing it the person on the phone's like
[98.46 --> 106.60]  huh like it sounds bad like a terrible speaker recording what's happening i used to love um
[106.60 --> 114.70]  what was it called so there was the ventrilo voice service i used to love ventrilo is that like
[114.70 --> 121.38]  you type in and it speaks out no no no this is like like before discord i think team speak i don't
[121.38 --> 126.34]  know if team speak was around when ventrilo was originally around but like they eventually became
[126.34 --> 130.34]  like the two platforms for a while and then people kind of left ventrilo and it was team speak for a
[130.34 --> 133.78]  while and then skype and all this other kind of stuff came around and the discord finally got rid
[133.78 --> 139.14]  of skype and all that junk but back in the day there was ventrilo the name is ringing a bell i
[139.14 --> 145.70]  just don't know and one of my favorite things used to be because you could bind keys on your keyboard
[145.70 --> 154.08]  to soundboard to play through that's if you were saying so it totally got rid of that like quality
[154.08 --> 157.62]  issue that you were just talking about yeah and people could get like you could have a levels issue
[157.62 --> 162.20]  still you could but if people like tone it and all that kind of stuff and there was people who would
[162.20 --> 169.32]  do ventrilo pranks um oh yeah that's oh wait is that the one the duke nukem one yes yeah yeah yeah
[169.32 --> 173.26]  this was amazing yeah yeah yeah ventrilo harassment yeah that's what they call it duke nukem style
[173.26 --> 180.50]  you're gonna put that on your screen put it up uh yeah there's a famous one and chila pranks this
[180.50 --> 187.58]  duke nukem style one was huge ah okay the person he's talking to on that one is it nine million views
[187.58 --> 192.40]  and this was uploaded in 2007 is that a boy or a girl this was big that he's talking to you i don't
[192.40 --> 197.46]  i always thought it was a young boy well i think it's a girl we can't you know people knows people uh
[197.46 --> 201.10]  isn't there a name for the the person like debbie or something i don't know
[201.10 --> 209.02]  whoa all right we're not gonna play it i'm here to chew gum
[209.02 --> 215.86]  oh i love that everyone should watch that person's angry but there's there's some really
[215.86 --> 222.02]  good ones one of my favorite one is just someone has a soundboard of this like random girl just
[222.02 --> 227.76]  talking about nothing important and it was my favorite because he would just jump into channels
[227.76 --> 233.98]  and you know like the classic nerd like oh my god it's a girl yeah oh and it would just be like
[233.98 --> 239.54]  yeah like on fridays sometimes me and my friends will like go to the store and i'll like buy a
[239.54 --> 245.88]  chocolate bar and everyone's like oh yeah that's so cool it was oh man i have heard that i just used
[245.88 --> 250.10]  to love it one time we were pranking people with the soundboards and we're just about done and then
[250.10 --> 254.76]  my friend goes one more one more one more and he dials it in and we're using a soundboard from the
[254.76 --> 262.46]  movie phone booth okay yeah it was a keefer sutherland movie with uh colin fit not colin farrell right
[262.46 --> 268.94]  is that his name will farrell colin farrell colin furt no no colin furt there's a dude from pride
[268.94 --> 273.12]  and prejudice anyway the movie is there's a dude in a phone booth and then yeah the guy he's talking
[273.12 --> 277.08]  on the phone allegedly has a sniper rifle pointed at him so he stays in the phone booth the whole time
[277.08 --> 283.46]  yeah so there's a soundboard based on that and it's a creepy soundboard and we call this person and
[283.46 --> 288.94]  it's a woman who answers and then the soundboard's real creepy it's saying like colin farrell yeah i have a
[288.94 --> 293.80]  32 calibers or like semi-automatic sniper rifle pointed directly at you like oh my goodness
[293.80 --> 299.04]  obviously gun nuts i don't know guns that's like stats are wrong or whatever but it's really bad
[299.04 --> 304.16]  you could have gotten a lot of trouble for this and um so okay it's like mildly funny we prank this
[304.16 --> 309.70]  person we hang up a little while later so as soon as i tell you what happens next you're gonna
[309.70 --> 315.36]  understand what happened but i didn't understand for weeks a few weeks later or a while later my mom
[315.36 --> 322.20]  was like like your friends tell your friends not to call here or like someone some creep called me
[322.20 --> 326.56]  and told me all this stuff and i was like shut up mom what are you talking about and then i was like
[326.56 --> 334.56]  my buddy i pranked my own mom my friend typed in my mom's number and i didn't even i remember
[334.56 --> 340.82]  i remember when she picked up thinking like do i know that person but i didn't i didn't actually
[340.82 --> 346.04]  recognize the voice and uh yeah i pranked my own mom and then i didn't even realize
[346.04 --> 349.66]  oh my there's so many points in the story where i could have realized
[349.66 --> 356.04]  that's hilarious yeah it was pretty bad anyways actual topics if you want to go down an awesome
[356.04 --> 360.86]  hilarious rabbit hole on youtube and you don't mind some bad language because sometimes the the
[360.86 --> 365.86]  people reacting get pretty angry check out ventrilo harassment really funny some of them suck but some of
[365.86 --> 371.28]  them are really funny but here's the other thing about my mom she thought it was real she didn't
[371.28 --> 376.78]  know it was a soundboard like everybody else she thought like she may not have thought that that was
[376.78 --> 380.86]  actually happening to her but she thought that she was talking to a person not a soundboard so i
[380.86 --> 382.08]  remember being like
[382.08 --> 390.36]  doesn't make sense all right anyway real news my favorite one if you guys can find it is uh a guy's
[390.36 --> 396.68]  talking in wow and one of his friends records him talking over ventrilo and just plays back
[396.68 --> 401.72]  himself talking just to like mess with him and there was one part where he goes like i think it's
[401.72 --> 407.64]  like three strength like three strength three strand leather belt and then goes like and the guy
[407.64 --> 413.16]  recorded like that weird his like weird voice thing at the end and his statement and just constantly
[413.16 --> 417.30]  played it back to him just drives him nuts my it's hilarious now that you say that it all makes sense
[417.30 --> 421.12]  i have a friend who used to say those words all the time and i never knew what it was from the
[421.12 --> 425.56]  leather belt thing yeah yeah what are you saying hilarious this is like a decade ago it's i haven't
[425.56 --> 429.90]  heard it in probably yeah like 10 years so i don't remember the exact line but it's something like that
[429.90 --> 434.22]  there's all those you ever have those weird memes that like you say for years and years and then you
[434.22 --> 440.34]  don't even like i i'm not even sure if i saw this video but one thing i still say once in a while is
[440.34 --> 450.90]  oh my god i love the map dust it's just like a same deal but from cs yeah like what level 18
[450.90 --> 459.26]  four strength two stem leather belt yeah there we go heck yeah i love it anyways uh the intel
[459.26 --> 468.06]  they invest a billion dollars to meet 14 nanometer demand bob swan intel cfo and interim ceo if you
[468.06 --> 473.36]  watch previous wan shows you'll know that the ceo left the company uh issued an open letter to the
[473.36 --> 479.36]  company's customers and partners today in the letter he addressed light uh tight supply on some
[479.36 --> 484.76]  of the company's products mainly their lower end entry level stuff they admit it outlining the set
[484.76 --> 491.54]  of actions intel is taking to tackle this problem he said uh the that there is a surprising return to
[491.54 --> 496.64]  pc tam or the total addressable market like the amount of people interested in buying as far as i know
[496.64 --> 501.98]  um there's there's yeah there's there's pc tam growth which there hasn't been since i believe
[501.98 --> 508.36]  yeah 2011 it's modest growth modest like in his letter he cites all these different stats of like
[508.36 --> 514.24]  our cloud computing business grew 25 this year something else grew 43 but then they don't say
[514.24 --> 519.46]  what the pc business grew they just say i think modest growth i think the point isn't necessarily that
[519.46 --> 524.90]  it's like oh it's so huge it's that it's growing at all we haven't had any pc tam growth uh since 20
[524.90 --> 529.36]  so for like the last seven years so that's that that is a pretty big deal regardless and it wasn't
[529.36 --> 534.32]  expected as it hasn't happened in seven years and a lot of speculators have been saying that it wouldn't
[534.90 --> 541.08]  uh but they're thinking that it's just it's fairly natural it's from the interest of people into
[541.08 --> 545.26]  gaming and all these other things well the spin that he puts on is that like they're doing such a
[545.26 --> 550.92]  dang good job that people are so interested in the new cpus that everybody wants to upgrade totally man
[550.92 --> 557.30]  yeah that's definitely it maybe it's just that everyone's 2600ks are just finally getting too old
[557.30 --> 567.90]  maybe that's it um there's also intel is also uh prioritizing production of xeon and core processors
[567.90 --> 573.78]  uh to serve the high performance segments of the market we'll get into why that matters later um and
[573.78 --> 579.04]  supply in general is tight particularly like we already said in the uh entry-level pc market intel
[579.04 --> 585.18]  believes they have at least the supply to meet the full year revenue outlook expected in july which
[585.18 --> 592.64]  was 4.5 billion higher than their january expectations so this reassurance study issued
[592.64 --> 597.46]  everybody um apparently has inspired confidence because their stock price went up like between
[597.46 --> 603.34]  three and five percent at the same time that amds went down so it appears to be a zero-sum game
[603.34 --> 611.08]  um so i guess intel went from like 45 to 47 and then amd went from 33 to 30 or something like that
[611.08 --> 616.72]  last time i checked that was a few hours ago though so i guess it's it's good people believe the bops
[616.72 --> 621.86]  one but why don't we break down just exactly what's happening here from a manufacturing perspective
[621.86 --> 631.26]  uh so when you're running in a fab there's a certain amount of wafers of cpu cores you can make
[631.26 --> 636.24]  or dyes you can make uh per month essentially that's your output is how many of these wafers
[636.24 --> 642.18]  you can put out per month and a cpu that has way more cores on it is like literally going to physically
[642.18 --> 647.58]  take up more of that wafer right so if they want to one wafer is going to have fewer
[647.58 --> 653.76]  dyes on it if they want to have these bigger cpus which they are because they're worth more money to
[653.76 --> 659.96]  them where they get more profit and there is an increase of demand for those cpus i think amd has done a
[659.96 --> 666.36]  great job of marketing uh cpus with higher core counts which is great because that's awesome because
[666.36 --> 672.50]  i think everyone wants that and people are jumping on board and wanting intel's version of those kind
[672.50 --> 677.78]  of high core count cpus as well which is increasing demand and taking up more space on these wafers
[677.78 --> 685.60]  right you also brought up something earlier which is where like um if you take up uh like like you need
[685.60 --> 690.98]  a block so if you take up a corner yeah it's like if you had a bucket and you're filling it with lego
[690.98 --> 695.94]  and you had those giant lego pieces you might only get like eight of them in your bucket yeah but if
[695.94 --> 701.40]  you had the same like weight of lego blocks but they were tiny pieces you could they would all just
[701.40 --> 707.88]  fit in so much more nicely which is why they're gonna mix up like there's the binning process and
[707.88 --> 711.78]  they're gonna mix up like they're gonna have some of the smaller ones edging out corners and the bigger
[711.78 --> 716.58]  ones and stuff but as you put more of these bigger ones in you're reducing the over amount the overall
[716.58 --> 721.20]  amount of real estate like the absolute number of of cores you can put on a wafer is reduced when
[721.20 --> 725.24]  the die size is bigger but they're you're saying they're gonna mix them up have you ever seen one
[725.24 --> 729.96]  of those cross sections i used to work at a place in forestry and they had a poster on the wall that
[729.96 --> 734.98]  showed a cross section of like i guess it was like a lumber industry industry poster oh like how they
[734.98 --> 739.62]  showed a log like you cut a log down and they showed all the little like two by fours a two by four
[739.62 --> 745.02]  go go there and a four by six will come out of the middle yeah that might be relatable to you i love
[745.02 --> 750.16]  those like explosion things yeah whatever what's that either way when that well when you take like
[750.16 --> 755.38]  a car or a log oh yeah case or whatever and you explode it you pull all the parts apart so you can
[755.38 --> 760.14]  see like where everything is and stuff it's cool um i think i know what poster you're talking about i
[760.14 --> 764.94]  think i've seen the same thing oh really yeah i don't know every kid yeah yeah had that on their wall
[764.94 --> 773.32]  we're all from like forest land canada um so yeah each each wafer can have multiple cv's as we're
[773.32 --> 777.78]  saying uh blah blah blah this is just a bunch of what we were just saying yeah so all of that is on
[777.78 --> 784.16]  on the 14 nanometer die so they are trying to allocate yeah yeah the 14 nanometer node i should
[784.16 --> 791.36]  say and they're trying to get as many of the fabs on the 14 nanometer node to produce these high-end
[791.36 --> 797.30]  core i9 and xeon 28 core chips what happened because of that was that the low end of the market
[797.30 --> 808.66]  like the what is it the hcl3 yeah no h310c jesus that lower end chip got the shaft because it's on the
[808.66 --> 813.70]  same node but it's not getting any priority because it doesn't make them as much money so in order to
[813.70 --> 819.06]  meet demand for that they made a completely new node a 22 nanometer version just to get the supply up
[819.06 --> 824.56]  of that meanwhile they're still trying to focus on the 10 nanometer node which they say they're
[824.56 --> 830.66]  making gains on i don't think that they're gonna they can't afford to not spend money on that yeah
[830.66 --> 839.14]  so this new this new billion dollars um that's just on top of it's on top of 14 billion that they
[839.14 --> 844.56]  already they already put out for cap expenditure in 2018 so this total of 15 billion is actual record
[844.56 --> 850.62]  and this billion dollars can be put into the various fabs in oregon arizona ireland and israel
[850.62 --> 860.58]  that produce on the 14 nanometer node is it crazy how much is that going to make a difference is it a lot
[860.58 --> 865.82]  no one knows how they're spending the money yeah that's the thing yeah and where's the money coming
[865.82 --> 871.28]  from is it just uh in their own coffers i mean probably do they do you think they had just enough
[871.28 --> 875.84]  like revenue kicking around do they have to take a shareholder dividends i don't it do
[875.84 --> 879.80]  this is probably reallocate it from a different cash in the bank
[879.80 --> 888.40]  just like okay we'll just we'll just drop a cool billion boom yeah i'm sure i'm sure they've got
[888.40 --> 892.20]  money in reserve and if they're like hey we need to crank up production because we're just going to
[892.20 --> 897.58]  make a ton of money because we'll sell everything that we make if we crank up production with a billion
[897.58 --> 902.64]  dollars then that's a pretty safe bet i guess if they're like we are not going to be able to produce
[902.64 --> 907.16]  enough it's low risk supply yeah exactly and if they're and if they're like hey we can spend a
[907.16 --> 912.36]  billion dollars and that will make it so that we can produce enough to match the demands then they're
[912.36 --> 916.48]  just like hey well we just get to sell a whole crap ton more cpus yeah and make up the money they
[916.48 --> 919.84]  must have the money sitting around because if they if it was the case that they had to like
[919.84 --> 925.40]  sell back their own stock then you would have seen the stock price dip and that didn't happen so it
[925.40 --> 930.10]  can't be that you know this is one of my favorite things to look up you're googling what are you
[930.10 --> 937.14]  googling how much money does nintendo have in the bank oh that's only as of 2015 though so nobody can
[937.14 --> 942.38]  see what you're looking at no i know i just wanted to look up the number um so like one of my favorite
[942.38 --> 947.72]  things to talk about every once in a while is nintendo because nintendo um i suspect compared to
[947.72 --> 957.12]  intel they're a relatively small company in terms of uh capex or uh or uh market cap market cap capital
[957.12 --> 964.30]  expenditure as well for sure um probably even literally just like employees um i don't know
[964.30 --> 969.20]  but i i'm assuming they're a much smaller company we can look this up yeah but people will always talk
[969.20 --> 974.24]  about like during the wii u phase yeah nintendo is very spiky um and during the wii u phase people
[974.24 --> 978.26]  are always talking about like is nintendo even gonna survive but they've got so much money in
[978.26 --> 987.38]  the bank what like you can see my jaw dropped is nintendo way bigger no nintendo had from the fiscal
[987.38 --> 997.82]  year 2010 to 2018 nintendo okay nintendo had a total of 5500 employees 5500 employees dude cactus club has
[997.82 --> 1005.42]  5 000 employees and no one in the u.s even knows where that is is that a canadian only company yeah
[1005.42 --> 1011.16]  yeah yeah okay yeah like they're they're a pretty lean company and they've got billions in the bank
[1011.16 --> 1017.12]  and people will be like oh we use doing bad is nintendo gonna die it's like no dude i can't remember
[1017.12 --> 1022.00]  what the stats are but there's something like if nintendo just immediately stops selling everything
[1022.00 --> 1028.24]  now and keeps their capital expenditure at the same amount and just makes no money at all they
[1028.24 --> 1032.84]  could survive for like a hundred years or something it's like you guys they're doing all right it seems
[1032.84 --> 1037.82]  like a natural fit because their products are always so bold and risky like they don't when they reach
[1037.82 --> 1041.40]  when they launch the wii they have no idea if people are gonna like it or not and same with the
[1041.40 --> 1045.60]  switch it's completely out there it seems like you better have some money for a rainy day yeah because
[1045.60 --> 1051.38]  they do and then they've done really well enough times that they've just got all this money that
[1051.38 --> 1054.10]  they can sit on and keep taking risks which is cool it's one of the reasons why i love nintendo
[1054.10 --> 1061.32]  that is cool so what is cactic club cat cat what is cat it's just a cactus club it's just a restaurant
[1061.32 --> 1067.60]  in in canada hold on i'm gonna get the numbers i'm on wikipedia now and it confirmed 5500 for
[1067.60 --> 1075.14]  nintendo's employee number until 106 000 yeah so that's what i said like like drastically different
[1075.14 --> 1083.06]  style company and even nintendo could drop that billion and be completely fine i think ibm has
[1083.06 --> 1090.04]  800 000 if i remember correctly no 300 380 000 which is that means there's more people in the world
[1090.04 --> 1097.68]  working for ibm than holding icelandic passports there are fewer icelanders than ibm employees
[1097.68 --> 1102.64]  there might be some overlap there i wonder how many icelandic ibm employees there are hit us up on
[1102.64 --> 1109.12]  super chat yeah if you're an icelandic ibm employee toss us some of that old school computer money yeah
[1109.12 --> 1115.96]  give us them that model m money yeah from the north are we are we done this topic yeah okay we're gonna
[1115.96 --> 1122.16]  move on i think so we did it i think uh did we talk about the 22 nanometer stuff yeah and the stock
[1122.16 --> 1130.14]  changes yeah cool yeah i think we're good yeah moving on uh amazon has an anti-union video that has
[1130.14 --> 1137.50]  leaked allegedly because it only sort of leaked it's sort of leaked so gizmodo broke the story okay
[1137.50 --> 1145.84]  and they say that they obtained a video from anonymous sources they posted screenshots at gizmodo but they
[1145.84 --> 1151.76]  did not post the video themselves because they say that they post the video that it will compromise
[1151.76 --> 1157.88]  the people who leaked it so they have they themselves have reached out to amazon to ask amazon to publish
[1157.88 --> 1166.38]  the video that's not gonna happen correct and also it's kind of fishy because it is fishy it's kind of
[1166.38 --> 1175.30]  like political then because amazon has its enemies oh yeah like in business and in politics so that's
[1175.30 --> 1180.94]  interesting okay let's get it let's just let's just unwrap yeah what this is news site gizmodo has
[1180.94 --> 1187.34]  obtained what it calls a 45 minute union busting training video so amazon uses training videos all
[1187.34 --> 1191.90]  the time like cartoonized animated videos to train management and lower level employees and everything
[1191.90 --> 1199.62]  yeah um allegedly this video was produced i think by amazon and then sent to team leaders of whole foods
[1199.62 --> 1205.46]  last week and whole foods of course is owned by amazon now they sold them or amazon bought whole foods
[1205.46 --> 1212.42]  for 13 billion last year about a year point seven billion dollars less than whatsapp was worth to facebook
[1212.42 --> 1221.20]  yeah that was 16 um so the the video's narrator states that the video is specifically designed to give you
[1221.20 --> 1225.80]  the manager of whole foods the tools that you need for success when it comes to labor organizing
[1225.80 --> 1231.88]  so it all well i'll go over some some of the other stuff that it also states it also says we are not
[1231.88 --> 1238.36]  anti-union but we are not neutral either i have no idea what that's supposed to that means you're anti-union
[1238.36 --> 1244.72]  yeah pretty much uh we do not believe quote unquote this is not me saying this quote unquote we do not
[1244.72 --> 1251.82]  believe unions are in the best interest of our customers our shareholders or most importantly our associates
[1251.82 --> 1258.06]  meaning employees yeah associates are employees our business model is built upon speed innovation and customer
[1258.06 --> 1265.10]  obsession things that are generally not associated with union uh when we lose sight of those critical focus areas
[1265.10 --> 1272.14]  we jeopardize everyone's job security yours mine and the associates associates so the video provides some
[1272.14 --> 1279.18]  background on the neighbor or the national labor relations act as well as showing some like different warning signs
[1279.18 --> 1285.66]  so if you are a manager at this whole foods and you see any of the following you might have a potential
[1285.66 --> 1291.58]  union not like unfolding in your hands are about to erupt so warning signs such as use of words like living
[1291.58 --> 1299.98]  wage and steward distribution of petitions and flyers associates raising concerns on behalf of their co-workers
[1299.98 --> 1307.50]  that's a big one well oh or even more blatant wearing union t-shirts hats or jackets workers who aren't normally
[1307.50 --> 1311.98]  connected to each other suddenly hanging out together don't make friends with people that you're not
[1311.98 --> 1318.38]  already friends with okay any other associate behavior that is out of character that's a little
[1318.38 --> 1323.98]  police statey that's i try to like i i try to make it so that people at philpain are friends because i want
[1323.98 --> 1328.22]  everyone to be friendly maybe i'm doing the wrong thing well if it comes from the top then it's it's not
[1328.22 --> 1334.30]  a warning sign right okay good call the video then asked managers to listen to 10 hypothetical employees
[1334.30 --> 1339.10]  and select whether their remarks constitute a warning sign or an innocent interaction
[1340.70 --> 1345.90]  um so they say they and then they talk about um what you're allowed to speak so what you're allowed
[1345.90 --> 1351.42]  to say to employees that is legal so apparently basically anything goes um there's nothing really
[1351.42 --> 1357.10]  unlawful that you can say in regards to unionizing but they still give you some guidelines such as you
[1357.10 --> 1361.42]  would never threaten to close your building just because associates joined a union
[1361.42 --> 1367.26]  but you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation which in turn
[1367.90 --> 1372.86]  could hurt customer obsession which ultimately could threaten the building's continued existence
[1376.94 --> 1383.58]  potential organization uh are supposed to be escalated oh yeah so if you see this happening at
[1383.58 --> 1388.38]  your store you're supposed to escalate this to human resources and general managers immediately
[1388.38 --> 1396.14]  quash it nip it in the bud the video itself does not appear to be publicly available online as we
[1396.14 --> 1400.54]  already uh yeah i tried to go to live leak and stuff like that it might be on now this was like five
[1400.54 --> 1405.66]  hours ago but yeah it doesn't appear to be available uh gizmodo like he already said asked amazon to publish
[1405.66 --> 1411.10]  the video and yeah basically the rest of it is just what what was already spoken about so you have a
[1411.10 --> 1418.22]  you have a hot take i have some problems with this okay okay full disclosure first unions are awesome
[1418.22 --> 1425.66]  those lights just died sometimes they're really really important when you need a union you need a union
[1425.66 --> 1433.58]  i'm not anti-union at all but i'm also not pro-union it depends it depends in an ideal world
[1433.58 --> 1439.02]  there'd be no unions because in an ideal world every employer would treat would would it would treat their
[1439.02 --> 1445.98]  employees really well now the fact that this story when you read about it like i had to
[1445.98 --> 1451.42]  really scrutinize this article to to figure out like oh this is actually talking about whole foods
[1451.42 --> 1456.62]  it's not talking about amazon oh because it's it only says that like in one place near the top and one
[1456.62 --> 1460.78]  place near the bottom and the rest is it talks about amazon's track record of like people peeing in
[1460.78 --> 1466.14]  bottles or amazon yeah there's been some pretty brutal news out of amazon yeah and everyone knows amazon
[1466.14 --> 1471.90]  sucks in that way or has and especially if you're a low-end employee yeah and that level that they
[1471.90 --> 1476.22]  dodge paying taxes and that they like kind of strong arm the cities that they operate in to give
[1476.22 --> 1481.66]  them favorable like subsidies and and tax exemptions and stuff like that so they're really focused on
[1481.66 --> 1487.34]  having a on benefiting the customer they're obsessed with the customer at the expense of of other things
[1487.34 --> 1494.54]  like employee happiness but this is about whole foods and whole foods has its own ceo and you know i
[1494.54 --> 1499.74]  i guess ostensibly like its own practices and stuff i don't know how entangled those two companies are
[1499.74 --> 1508.30]  but that's just one thing i wanted to keep in mind um obviously it would it would definitely be the
[1508.30 --> 1513.74]  case that amazon just like other big retailers like walmart or whoever a target who have been
[1513.74 --> 1518.94]  scrutinized for this in the past it would be really bad if they had their workers unionized i don't think
[1518.94 --> 1523.34]  it would be that bad for whole foods it'd be worse for amazon if they got you their workers got you
[1523.34 --> 1531.26]  yeah because i think a lot would have to change um i i have only ever personally been in one union
[1531.90 --> 1536.30]  i thought you're gonna say in one whole foods uh i think that might also be true
[1537.34 --> 1541.82]  uh there's a did you like nature's fair near here which is essentially the same thing i've been in
[1541.82 --> 1546.62]  there a bunch of times that's like local all right yeah have you did you like working in a union no i
[1546.62 --> 1551.26]  freaking hated it um but i may have that my problem is that i've only worked in one
[1552.14 --> 1561.26]  and my case was relatively unique i guess um where i worked at a bread factory i worked at canada bread
[1561.26 --> 1567.82]  factory you're a wholesome guy very wholesome you're a whole wheat oh yeah we made some of that um by the
[1567.82 --> 1573.58]  way basically all the bread and somewhere like walmart all comes from the same spot and is made the same way
[1573.58 --> 1578.78]  and just gets put in different bags it's great uh anyways i i used to work there we were all in a
[1578.78 --> 1585.18]  union it was a multi whatever union where like it oversaw a bunch of different types of workers
[1585.18 --> 1590.22]  yeah like where we live there's the bc geu it's the biggest union and then that covers like everyone
[1590.22 --> 1595.82]  from prison guards to firefighters yeah yeah yeah this this wasn't that one but it was a different
[1595.82 --> 1601.10]  form of a similar thing where it's a bunch of different disciplines uh and our union guy i guess the
[1601.10 --> 1604.94]  steward from reading this for our factory was a
[1607.50 --> 1615.10]  expletive ah i hated that dude you hated him with everything i've got uh i had to pay union dues when
[1615.10 --> 1620.70]  all i'm trying to do is make money to go to school and this guy was just a big jerk and none of the
[1620.70 --> 1624.46]  people i didn't know a single person that worked there that liked him and there was nothing we could
[1624.46 --> 1629.98]  really do about it um the the people above him in the union that we tried to contact wouldn't get rid of
[1629.98 --> 1637.42]  him so we had like the same problem that you would have with like some jerk boss oh yeah within the
[1637.42 --> 1642.94]  union and i had to pay him to be a jerk to me and i was like this freaking sucks do unions ever go away
[1643.50 --> 1648.06]  like once they don't know i don't know enough about it i don't really personally want to comment too
[1648.06 --> 1653.18]  much on this because i really don't know enough about it i just had one singular bad experience and i
[1653.18 --> 1658.38]  haven't been in a union outside of that so i really don't know i do know from like history that there's
[1658.38 --> 1665.10]  been multiple times where unions were absolutely necessary completely to solve a giant major problem
[1665.10 --> 1669.50]  but then do they ever go away after that that's the that's the thing i don't i don't know i know
[1669.50 --> 1673.50]  quite a few people that don't like them i know quite a few people that do like them i know my experience
[1673.50 --> 1679.34]  sucked um yeah i worked for a union and it was sweet for me because i made more money than i should
[1679.34 --> 1684.62]  have and uh that was great cool um i have a friend who's in a union again he's he actually is a corrections
[1684.62 --> 1691.10]  correctional officer okay prison guard and uh it sucks for him because the pay raises are completely
[1691.10 --> 1695.26]  just like regimented it's not like you kicked a lot of butt this year and you're gonna get a sweet
[1695.26 --> 1700.06]  pay raise it's like well you worked here this long and we're they're renegotiating the union
[1700.06 --> 1706.46]  agreement this year and we're all gonna get six percent raise and that raise by the way that we're
[1706.46 --> 1711.50]  they're fighting for isn't for your particular job it's for like what you said a cross-section of
[1711.50 --> 1715.26]  different industries and everyone who fits in this bucket is getting the same raise even though
[1715.90 --> 1720.06]  you've got to deal with people stabbing each other and stuff i like my one of my problems was
[1720.62 --> 1726.54]  where where i worked when you when you got hired they had to do a super basic math test
[1727.66 --> 1734.22]  and the super basic math test was good there's 24 slices in a low and then five loads that basically
[1734.22 --> 1739.34]  they're trying to see like how how smart are you because there's like there's a position called bun
[1739.34 --> 1746.06]  packer that was great where you you pick up stuff off a conveyor line you grab it you turn to the
[1746.06 --> 1752.78]  right you put it down you rotate back you grab it you turn to the right and you put it your body get
[1752.78 --> 1758.46]  all all the that's the whole job for eight hours a day oh so like that job can be done by anyone
[1758.46 --> 1762.78]  but then there's like the mixer who has to like put in the ingredients and that's a little bit more
[1762.78 --> 1766.46]  specific and there's people who like pack the trucks and you have to put the right amount of
[1766.46 --> 1770.06]  carts of the right amount of stuff on the right trucks and there's like slightly more advanced
[1770.06 --> 1775.82]  jobs so so you're a bun packer well everyone starts there regardless of how well you do did you ever
[1775.82 --> 1782.70]  leave the bun pack i did yeah i got moved up really fast and the union head didn't like that because the
[1783.58 --> 1789.02]  the non-union guys got to pick where you worked but the union guys picked your hours so because i went
[1789.02 --> 1795.02]  up in position really quickly the union had just screwed me not in terms of he gave me really low hours but
[1795.02 --> 1802.06]  he would just wreck me like he'd shift me at like the worst possible times and he'd always have me
[1802.06 --> 1808.78]  as like the emergency call guy oh so he'd be he'd be like be there in 15 minutes uh and he'd call me
[1808.78 --> 1814.06]  as i was trying to go to bed because it was purely on call and i was just like oh my god and he made my
[1814.06 --> 1818.30]  life hell for an entire summer so i don't i don't like that and then they have all those things like
[1818.94 --> 1824.30]  like uh promotions based on seniority and stuff yeah it's like god he's been here 20 years i don't care
[1824.30 --> 1830.38]  that's because he sucks yeah he has nothing else he has no other prospects everyone else good left
[1830.38 --> 1835.02]  so yeah i don't know i think there are situations where it can be bad and i think there's situations
[1835.02 --> 1840.86]  where it can be good and i have no idea for whole foods okay well here's my one last this is my tinfoil
[1840.86 --> 1846.70]  hat hot take sure yeah can you get the screenshot up from that article yes so if you open up the goat
[1846.70 --> 1850.70]  gizmodo article they've got some embedded screen caps from this alleged video
[1850.70 --> 1855.58]  video just go to the first one just just go through it just give me a sec guys i'll bring it
[1855.58 --> 1861.10]  we're gonna go on a journey here actually that's the screenshot that i want i'm still gonna go here
[1861.10 --> 1864.06]  because it'll probably be bigger yeah so we might as well give them
[1868.30 --> 1872.22]  living wage grievance contract representation is that what that last word is
[1872.22 --> 1882.62]  i want to go to the tips one tips yeah there's this this one okay tips remember remember managers
[1882.62 --> 1889.98]  tips if you see someone uh trying to organize just remember t-i-p-s threaten interrogate promise and spy
[1891.66 --> 1899.50]  i have a hard time believing that any company that sounds so fake that is so egregious and outrageous
[1899.50 --> 1905.58]  that if that's true that's crazy but there's it's just so outrageous that it can't be true
[1906.14 --> 1910.86]  and then i see that i'm just like is this whole thing fake does this video even exist because that
[1910.86 --> 1918.30]  is just over the top threaten and interrogate come on as if promise promise what so like and
[1918.30 --> 1922.94]  are they telling you to lie because what do you promise i guess that's what that means but promise
[1922.94 --> 1927.66]  is the nicest word in there but can you imagine telling like all of this the executive executives are
[1927.66 --> 1930.94]  telling the management like sitting down the team leaders at whole foods which is like
[1930.94 --> 1936.06]  threaten and interrogate your employees yeah exactly there's no way they said that doesn't sound real
[1936.06 --> 1945.02]  come on so i think it's uh fake news i wonder if they got sourced something that seemed super
[1945.02 --> 1950.46]  legit and then they just believed it it could be man the russians that throws me off a lot to be
[1950.46 --> 1955.34]  honest because that sounds really really you know what uh this interrogate thing made me think of
[1955.34 --> 1962.06]  uh one of one of my employees how's it going aj uh he was mentioning in french uh the question mark
[1963.02 --> 1970.46]  it translates to interrogation mark oh interesting well there's a uh there's one he'll say interrogation
[1970.46 --> 1975.42]  mark when he's talking about question mark i'm like that's so intense yeah yeah yeah it's a weird
[1975.42 --> 1980.86]  translation there's an obscure form of punctuation that is a mix but you know how when you wanted to ask
[1980.86 --> 1985.10]  a question intensely and you use a question mark and an exclamation point yeah well there's a one
[1985.10 --> 1992.14]  unified really like notation it's called an interrobang i have heard that phrase but i didn't know that
[1992.14 --> 2000.54]  yes um there's actually a really good episode of 99 invisible about it tarrobang there's like a 99 invisible
[2000.54 --> 2006.30]  oh it's this awesome like design focused podcast yeah you you should uh show everyone it looks pretty cool
[2006.30 --> 2009.98]  it does look cool i'll bring it up there's this dude who like championed it and like tried to make
[2009.98 --> 2018.38]  it happen really hard wait so it's is it a thing or no um like is it is it officially recognized notation
[2018.38 --> 2024.22]  in terrobang i guess it's well it's not on the keyboard it ain't real
[2026.14 --> 2032.22]  kind of looks like a really powerful p it could be an alt code thing though interrobang alt code
[2032.22 --> 2042.54]  it has a unicode yeah boy interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark
[2044.14 --> 2049.90]  few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character the standard interrobang
[2050.46 --> 2059.50]  is at unicode code point u plus 203d are your sponsors rip yeah sponsor time
[2059.50 --> 2064.78]  do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[2064.78 --> 2070.30]  what is that is that pink panther that's no what is it oh god
[2073.34 --> 2080.86]  savage jerky they oh yeah gave us some mojo jalapeno hot sauce can i hold uh something
[2082.14 --> 2085.98]  for now because that's almost certainly going to come home with me and never come back you say mojo
[2085.98 --> 2093.98]  it's not mojo it's not mojo no it's not mojo jalapeno i said mojo forever and then we got
[2093.98 --> 2098.62]  very much corrected by the twitch chat and they're apparently correct i looked it up what does mojo
[2098.62 --> 2106.62]  mean in spanish i don't know i'm gonna look that up i know what boho means what's what does boho bohemian
[2106.62 --> 2119.42]  in the tinterest world mojo spanish pronunciation moxo well i'm not gonna try that uh yeah it's
[2119.42 --> 2125.58]  eating sauce yeah it just means some type of sauce okay we have ghost pepper uh buffalo sauce and sriracha
[2125.58 --> 2132.06]  bacon and original jerky here and he's got mojo jalapeno which is so far my favorite jerky from savage
[2132.06 --> 2136.62]  jerky in sauce form so i'm super excited to try that at home because i'm definitely going to steal
[2136.62 --> 2140.86]  it it's not coming back unless someone tells me to bring it back in which case it will immediately
[2140.86 --> 2145.66]  come back uh their jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with
[2145.66 --> 2150.46]  the goal to create a snack that is full of flavor and spice and isn't bad for you all at the same time
[2151.02 --> 2155.42]  they have 13 different flavors uh which goes on top of the ones that we have here
[2155.42 --> 2165.42]  i left this world for a second there i'm like pavlog's dog right now jaze uh they also include
[2165.42 --> 2170.86]  things like sriracha bacon uh which i have here and maple buffalo bacon and many others they also make
[2170.86 --> 2176.70]  barbecue sauce hot sauce and spice rub like the hot sauce mojo jalapeno that we have here uh their
[2176.70 --> 2181.02]  carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world which is pretty crazy we don't
[2181.02 --> 2188.54]  have um i've tried the the jerky and uh it's pretty brutal it's an experience i think i did the last
[2188.54 --> 2193.90]  show that linus was on i ate one just nonchalant without telling him and he didn't notice so i was
[2193.90 --> 2198.38]  pretty proud of that because usually i like sort of die when i when i eat it i remember it's on it was
[2198.38 --> 2201.90]  the first wancho i was ever on i tried it and i tried to play real cool and you're just sitting there
[2201.90 --> 2209.98]  and then suddenly like your pupils fill up with liquid it's like i'm cool yeah everything yeah
[2210.86 --> 2217.10]  it's blood coming out of my ears dude it's like it's pretty pretty normal one thing from coming
[2217.10 --> 2223.26]  from someone who enjoys spice i like spice but to a limit like once it gets to his once it gets past
[2223.26 --> 2227.74]  my limit it becomes not fun that's everyone in the world dude no there's some people that enjoy the
[2227.74 --> 2233.18]  pain oh there's absolutely people that enjoy the masochists i think my dad is one of those people
[2233.18 --> 2239.58]  because my dad will eat any hot sauce ever he will like taunt people at restaurants where like
[2239.58 --> 2244.70]  you know there's like like indian heat you order something it's like is this spicy as a white people
[2244.70 --> 2249.34]  spicy yeah yeah like if you're like very hot they'll be like all right i'll give you a medium
[2249.34 --> 2255.02]  he'll like taunt them yeah so that they'll like intentionally spike it even harder and he just loves it
[2255.02 --> 2259.66]  but then if they come out and he's sweating and he's like dabbing and he's like huh then they win
[2260.86 --> 2267.90]  but he also wins like he wants that my dad's crazy he also like my dad's a freak he'll also just pop
[2267.90 --> 2273.66]  jalapenos and not react at all because he's just a machine but anyways his mouth is just dead it's just
[2274.46 --> 2275.42]  it's just like a callus
[2277.42 --> 2282.06]  i've lost a hot sauce callus he has calluses for everything else i've lost all sensitivity in my mouth
[2282.06 --> 2288.78]  it makes me cool that's like why everything that's an acquired taste in life yeah so it's bad
[2289.82 --> 2296.46]  coffee cigars olives whiskey olives is an acquired taste it was for me okay a lot of people don't like
[2296.46 --> 2300.70]  olives i like them now and i get them and nobody eats them like at parties and stuff i we're getting
[2300.70 --> 2307.10]  off here i'm gonna switch off this for a second i love olives and to like a a point where it's a
[2307.10 --> 2313.02]  a character fault almost when i was a kid my mom used to buy canned olives and like the neighbors
[2313.02 --> 2317.34]  and my brother and i would like the neighbor's kids and my brother and i would all sit down and
[2317.34 --> 2321.82]  like play a board game or something and i'd just grab a can of olives and just eat the entire thing
[2321.82 --> 2328.54]  and then when i was done i would drink oh and it drove people insane but i didn't do it for that
[2328.54 --> 2332.62]  reason i actually just really liked it but anyways wait i have an olive story okay i had a party once
[2332.62 --> 2338.38]  and we're all eating olives and uh and then this one friend of mine was like we're just commenting
[2338.38 --> 2342.22]  on olives and blah blah blah and it was at the stage where i was just getting into them wasn't
[2342.22 --> 2346.54]  sure if i liked them or not yet and my friend was like this sounds so hardcore he was like uh yeah
[2348.38 --> 2354.22]  i had a flight of olives and he was like i think eating olives is like kind of erotic and then
[2354.22 --> 2360.70]  everyone was like i was like okay i never got to that everyone kind of just went silent it was like
[2361.90 --> 2369.10]  okay moving on like i'm not holding it against them like no i mean maybe it is whatever i just
[2369.10 --> 2372.94]  hadn't had that thought and it was just it's a very non-offensive thing to be into in that way but
[2372.94 --> 2382.06]  like geez anyways moving on fresh bush i mean if you want to like sell olives or anything else like
[2382.06 --> 2387.02]  services or anything for that matter you can use fresh books it is a super simple to use invoicing
[2387.02 --> 2392.38]  tool that actually does a lot more than help you create and send slick looking invoices which is a
[2392.38 --> 2396.86]  great feature in its own it helps you track your time with their timesheet function manage your
[2396.86 --> 2402.22]  expenses and it keeps track of who owes you what also has a feature that tells you when your clients
[2402.22 --> 2407.34]  look at your invoice for the first time which is a big deal and their mobile app has all the
[2407.34 --> 2411.82]  functionality of their desktop version which is cool so you can take fresh books wherever you go and not lose
[2411.82 --> 2416.06]  any features which is super annoying uh if you have any questions feel free to reach out to their
[2416.06 --> 2421.98]  support staff where you'll speak to a real human being no phone tree no escalations no return calls just
[2421.98 --> 2427.50]  just straight up answers visit freshbooks.com and enter when in the how did you hear about us section
[2427.50 --> 2436.46]  uh when you sign up for a free trial very cool and last but not least honey honey honey
[2436.46 --> 2448.38]  you were my sponsor spot i don't know the next line and you got me wanting you i do i i use honey all
[2448.38 --> 2453.10]  the time actually personally that isn't even like i don't have to say that i just do it's pretty sweet
[2453.10 --> 2458.06]  the ingredient or the sponsor the sponsor okay the only time i ever use honey the ingredient is in like
[2458.06 --> 2463.74]  uh chamomile or ginger tea because i'm sick but anyways moving forward uh you've probably heard us talk
[2463.74 --> 2468.30]  about honey before because they've they've uh been a sponsor of the show before but if you have it it's
[2468.30 --> 2474.86]  a free shopping tool that finds the best promo codes whenever you shop online at specific sites
[2474.86 --> 2480.46]  so like when you go to a site and you're in the checkout section when it finally shows the box to
[2480.46 --> 2486.38]  type in a promo code honey will be like hey i think i might have a few codes for this every time you read
[2486.38 --> 2491.98]  out this spot i'm like why don't i have this you should probably try it it's so stupid and you just press
[2491.98 --> 2496.30]  the button and it goes through an automated thing trying a bunch of codes and sometimes it'll be like
[2496.86 --> 2503.26]  hey i none of them worked sorry and sometimes you'll you'll get a pretty sweet code i i've saved
[2503.26 --> 2507.82]  a very notable amount of money i don't know exactly what it is but it's like i've saved a decent amount
[2507.82 --> 2511.98]  of money using honey that's sweet because like if you think about it if you've ever gone shopping for
[2511.98 --> 2515.58]  something and you get to the checkout section and you see a promo code box and you spend like five
[2515.58 --> 2519.82]  minutes on google going to a bunch of sketchy websites i've done that trying to get promo codes i've done
[2519.82 --> 2526.46]  that and then i i type them in and then they never never all expires with honey it actually works
[2526.46 --> 2531.02]  quite often yeah you don't have to do any of the sketchy stuff it just handles all of it for you and
[2531.02 --> 2535.50]  you don't have to copy and paste a million codes it just chugs through them as fast as it can way better
[2535.50 --> 2542.06]  and it's gonna know when the codes fail for you and update its central stuff and try to always have
[2542.06 --> 2547.66]  up-to-date codes as everyone attempts different surely the service costs tons of money though luke it's free
[2547.66 --> 2554.54]  honey for those of you that uh try it out it's a free browser extension available on chrome firefox
[2554.54 --> 2561.42]  and safari saves you time saves you money when you shop at over 30 000 stores honey works on amazon
[2561.42 --> 2568.38]  ebay newegg razer best buy walmart and more including skip the dishes i've had it work there quite a few
[2568.38 --> 2574.54]  times uh honey gets a small amount of commission from sites where honey saves you money uh there's also
[2574.54 --> 2581.58]  quite often honey specific discount codes oh yeah so that's how that will work nice and they'll get
[2581.58 --> 2586.78]  like a affiliate style partnerships there good business so they make money off of the places
[2586.78 --> 2591.50]  that you buy stuff from not off of you which is cool get that honey money and i understand why they
[2591.50 --> 2595.74]  explain that because i think that helps with some of the skepticism because it sounds too good to be
[2595.74 --> 2599.74]  true and then you're like oh okay they're just making money like travel agents a different source yeah
[2599.74 --> 2604.78]  yeah that's a pretty good pretty good comparison um it installs in just two clicks which is sweet
[2605.18 --> 2610.86]  uh it says colton brandon and a few others here at lmg have used honey to save money shopping online
[2610.86 --> 2621.26]  um and yeah do what colton does go to honey.com slash linus and you got it done here's a fun thing i did
[2621.26 --> 2630.14]  today yeah this one uh oh so there's a new facebook vulnerability that facebook announced facebook
[2630.14 --> 2636.70]  engineers have discovered a security issue affecting almost 50 million accounts hey attackers exploited
[2636.70 --> 2641.82]  a vulnerability in facebook's code that impacted a feature called view as and that's one of those
[2641.82 --> 2646.78]  features where you look at your page as other people see it so like linkedin has that kind of thing
[2646.78 --> 2654.54]  it's actually a super cool feature um because it lets you see uh sorry i thought i saw someone
[2654.54 --> 2659.18]  in chat but it's someone with like a parody name of them uh it lets you see your page as that person
[2659.18 --> 2663.90]  so if you're trying to hide things from people you can pick someone who fits within a category
[2663.90 --> 2669.10]  yeah of your privacy settings check it out make sure it's all hidden properly yeah so there was a problem
[2669.10 --> 2677.98]  though because so what happened was it's like an interaction between multiple different features in
[2677.98 --> 2685.58]  the facebook code so it stemmed from a change that facebook made to their video uploading flow yeah which
[2685.58 --> 2695.50]  affected view as and that changed the video uploading flow was in july 2017 that's a pretty long time ago
[2695.50 --> 2701.50]  that sucks so facebook issued this like uh this post that they had fixed the vulnerability and informed
[2701.50 --> 2706.62]  law enforcement including the fbi and they said all these things that they like here's what we did
[2706.62 --> 2711.26]  because we care about your security so much they reset the access tokens of the 50 million counts
[2711.26 --> 2717.42]  affected the access tokens are like those uh they're like digital keys that allow you to not have to
[2717.42 --> 2723.26]  type in your name and password every time yeah enter your browser or navigate around and so this this
[2723.26 --> 2732.06]  exploit like got the keys so people could screw you and um so facebook they reset the access tokens to
[2732.06 --> 2735.82]  like 50 million accounts that were affected and then they took the precautionary step of resetting
[2735.82 --> 2741.02]  access tokens for yet another 40 million that they thought like um they could they had been subject to a
[2741.02 --> 2749.82]  view as look up in the past year some overlap there but yeah um i so i have heard from a person
[2749.82 --> 2753.90]  uh i haven't talked to many people about this yet but in the small group of people that i have talked
[2753.90 --> 2759.10]  to i have heard from a person that they had to re-log into facebook on all of their devices
[2759.10 --> 2764.38]  well here's the fun this is the last night or yes this is the fun thing i did today um because when you
[2765.90 --> 2772.14]  here's what i did i went to my phone and i went facebook and i got this
[2772.14 --> 2782.14]  and facebook messenger as well session expired please log in again which means i either was
[2782.14 --> 2788.94]  compromised i'm either one of the 50 million or one of the 40 million yeah and you don't know which one
[2788.94 --> 2794.86]  and then it says that once you log in again you will see on your news feed a notification at the top
[2794.86 --> 2803.74]  that explains what happened damn it yeah i didn't get logged out on anything dang it instagram as well
[2806.38 --> 2811.02]  facebook has yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or whether any information
[2811.02 --> 2815.66]  was accessed they don't know who's behind the attacks they don't know from which geographic region
[2815.66 --> 2822.14]  the attackers hail i mean you can probably guarantee that in some way it was misused like
[2822.14 --> 2827.50]  they're gonna try to harvest some form of information i don't know what it's gonna be
[2827.50 --> 2834.78]  what if they just made funny posts like they just made luke status lol i hacked this guy's account
[2834.78 --> 2839.02]  that's luke status don't you hate when your finger punches through the toilet paper
[2841.82 --> 2847.66]  everyone ew luke tmi why would you post that i did it and i have that like extension on my computer so
[2847.66 --> 2853.26]  i can't see my news feed have you heard about that oh no but i like the idea no it's great and it puts
[2853.26 --> 2858.06]  like an inspirational quote where the news feed is or where the i don't know what it's even called
[2858.06 --> 2863.58]  the the feed in general not necessarily news because it's your friends post and stuff but yeah i i only
[2863.58 --> 2869.10]  exclusively use facebook for chats and groups yeah that's awesome um so i just banned the feed so i
[2869.10 --> 2873.90]  wouldn't even know if you have that on mobile no but i just don't go to the facebook app on mobile i
[2873.90 --> 2878.30]  just only use messenger yeah that'd be awesome they should get it for instagram but then that
[2878.30 --> 2887.18]  would get rid of the entire app god why instagram i guess you you could see like stories and pms
[2887.74 --> 2890.54]  instead of the inspirational quote they should give you a nihilist meme
[2892.62 --> 2898.46]  just a direct feed from the nihilist rb's twitter yeah just the inevitable end of the universe is to heat
[2898.46 --> 2903.34]  death yeah this is nothing matters nothing nothing that you do matters because it will be deleted by the
[2903.34 --> 2912.78]  sun um anyways so that's that's scary if you got logged out of all your stuff um just a heads up
[2912.78 --> 2917.42]  so you may have access to your account may have been pwned like me yeah oh facebook by the way says
[2917.42 --> 2923.58]  you don't need to update your password uh because it was access token based not password based so you
[2923.58 --> 2928.22]  don't really have to do anything they didn't forge the key to the lock they just walked around the door
[2928.22 --> 2935.02]  that's how i described that security style cool because some people talk about like oh like i have
[2935.02 --> 2940.94]  a password that's 100 characters this account is invulnerable to everything no because if they find a
[2940.94 --> 2949.66]  way to just not have to use the password or if you give it to them or yeah or that yeah did you follow
[2949.66 --> 2956.22]  the uh the disney fox comcast thing like pretty much not at all we've talked about it a little bit
[2956.86 --> 2963.34]  um let me give you a 10 seconder sure okay because like it's it's been evolving over the summer
[2963.34 --> 2969.18]  there's these really big players that are all trying to trying to uh acquire each other because there's a
[2969.18 --> 2975.98]  giant race for streaming platform and where you're going to watch your tv next so let me give you the tldr hold on
[2975.98 --> 2984.94]  zeke d did a super chat sorry i'm new to this stuff i don't know the youtube streaming stuff
[2984.94 --> 2990.62]  he said you guys are awesome oh that's us that's us yeah yeah high five dude thanks man yeah nice
[2990.62 --> 2997.18]  also rip headphone users floatplane for the win i appreciate it man thank you very much i appreciate
[2997.18 --> 3003.42]  you yeah by the way zeke floatplane has a new payment system which is cool and there's now no bitcoin
[3003.42 --> 3009.10]  though no no bitcoin no bitcoin and there's now discord integrations from floatplane.com
[3009.74 --> 3016.86]  to discord what does that mean uh you can have your account sync up so this is it's a general
[3016.86 --> 3022.94]  thing any of the creators can do it i haven't told tech deals or bitwit yet because we're still testing
[3022.94 --> 3026.46]  things a little bit and making sure it's a little bit more cleaned up but theoretically they could turn
[3026.46 --> 3031.90]  it on anytime um but there's there's still some work to do before it's perfect um and it makes it so
[3031.90 --> 3037.74]  that if you join that creator's discord you get a special role saying you're like a subscriber to
[3037.74 --> 3041.74]  floatplane oh yeah and you can get granted access to a chat i don't know how the creators want to
[3041.74 --> 3046.78]  decide oh they get to implement the perks as they want yeah so much freedom the land of the free is
[3046.78 --> 3052.86]  floatplane yeah seriously it also has a notification feature so it can like post links to new videos as
[3052.86 --> 3057.02]  they come up into the discord and whatnot that's cool yeah because you're just hanging on discord anyway
[3057.02 --> 3062.62]  yeah anyway here's the timeline from the whole like thanks auction drama there's a ton of auctions to
[3062.62 --> 3069.42]  buy stuff it's actually kind of interesting okay fox was for sale like 20th century fox oh wait is that
[3069.42 --> 3073.82]  different than fox i think that's a subset of fox i'm gonna cut you off for one quick second we got
[3073.82 --> 3082.78]  another crazy super chat no idea what this is worth but it's 1024 sec is that uh that's not singapore
[3082.78 --> 3089.90]  is it what is sec currency he said olive review channel on floatplane heck yeah dude oh it's swedish
[3089.90 --> 3102.94]  krona nice nice how much was it uh 1024 from that's 150 bucks of rules canadian holy geez yeah buddy thank
[3102.94 --> 3109.74]  you thank you flow plane okay sorry let's let's get back to the fox was for sale disney wanted to buy it
[3109.74 --> 3114.70]  disney's making a streaming service and plus they also own a large part of hulu so buying fox gets
[3114.70 --> 3119.50]  you a lot of sweet shows over the years like family guy and all sorts of stuff yeah um that they could
[3119.50 --> 3124.70]  put on the streaming services so fox wanted to firefly so there you go disney wanted to buy fox
[3125.58 --> 3131.42]  comcast was competing with them to buy fox and they had like a bidding war and in the end disney won
[3131.42 --> 3140.30]  and they acquired fox but um meanwhile fox owned 39 of this european network called sky
[3141.66 --> 3145.58]  and obviously both of these companies comcast and disney want to be in europe because they want to
[3145.58 --> 3153.74]  expand globally so while fox was for sale and being bid on by disney and comcast fox itself which is owned
[3153.74 --> 3159.42]  by rupert murdoch was trying to get 100 stake in sky or at least a majority stake in sky or wait
[3159.42 --> 3167.66]  comcast was no no fox owned sky or owned 39 of sky on 39 of sky and yeah and and fox was trying to
[3167.66 --> 3173.74]  own it wholly so that when when it was when fox was bought whoever bought it would also get all sky
[3174.62 --> 3179.82]  so in the end between disney and comcast disney won they spent more than they wanted to and they
[3179.82 --> 3186.70]  they got fox but they didn't end up getting sky because when comcast did not win the bid to get
[3186.70 --> 3194.70]  what what go when comcast did not win the bid to get fox they started bidding on sky and they actually
[3194.70 --> 3200.86]  outbid fox on bidding on sky does this make sense okay yeah
[3201.74 --> 3213.42]  ah uh so now so then comcast owns part of sky and disney because they bought fox they own part of sky
[3213.42 --> 3219.18]  and in the end um fox was just or wait no disney didn't get it it wasn't it ended up not being
[3219.18 --> 3224.70]  part of the deal and then fox was like screw it comcast you can have all the sky so now the at the end
[3225.26 --> 3234.46]  disney owned fox comcast owned sky there's no more partial ownership okay there you have it that
[3235.10 --> 3241.66]  was a mess not not your explanation just everything that happened there was crazy it's a it's pretty
[3241.66 --> 3247.42]  amount of back and forth pretty interesting little dance there i'm surprised they i'm surprised disney
[3247.42 --> 3251.58]  gave up on that because they've been just chomping things lately i'm surprised they were just like no
[3252.30 --> 3259.58]  we're taking that 39 i don't i don't know how that works i don't because the disney deal i thought was
[3259.58 --> 3265.18]  just going through so much earlier that i don't know if this had an effect like that they ended up
[3265.18 --> 3269.02]  changing the price that they pay for fox because they thought that sky was gonna be part of the fox deal
[3269.02 --> 3279.50]  crazy hold on what's the sale price here okay hold on you guys need to recheck the caption on the amazon
[3279.50 --> 3286.62]  gizmodo article you got the tips picture wrong people are flipping out oh really let's look into this
[3286.62 --> 3297.10]  the tips for the tips oh don't want to report the wrong thing no um bob swan bob swan that's one
[3297.66 --> 3304.94]  okay we're navigating back now we are you got to go to the original source though yeah gizmodo
[3306.46 --> 3314.38]  what is it he says the caption that's right under it tips are the tactics amazon advises management
[3314.38 --> 3325.74]  oh not to use pretty big important difference oof so oof okay okay well now i'm just gonna shift blame
[3326.94 --> 3327.82]  to gizmodo
[3330.14 --> 3338.86]  well okay because that that uh screenshot is really incriminating and deflamatory but they don't
[3338.86 --> 3344.78]  actually i don't believe they address it in their article except for this little caption so i think
[3344.78 --> 3346.78]  that's a little misleading
[3349.34 --> 3353.66]  but yeah let's own up we didn't read the caption yeah obviously they don't
[3354.86 --> 3358.22]  they don't want people interrogating and spying how's it going dude
[3358.22 --> 3365.18]  hey you guys call super chats uh it's hard but sometimes we did two super chats hey no problem
[3365.18 --> 3368.94]  colin's colin's yelling at us are we supposed to love you guys dude you know how many kronos we're
[3368.94 --> 3375.02]  getting how many we're rolling kronos over a thousand yeah swedish kronos not bad look that up
[3376.06 --> 3384.70]  cool yeah i don't see any like main oh my god i didn't do anything i like the look what actually just
[3384.70 --> 3390.86]  are we still streaming did someone turn that oh god remotely through the app people please that that
[3390.86 --> 3401.02]  the the squid the squid uh dead so that means the camera's off oh my god the cat whoa anarchy
[3402.62 --> 3407.18]  are we streaming we are we are streaming and the camera's on you can see you wouldn't be able to see
[3407.18 --> 3414.06]  that oh oh i like uh interesting we got a little bit of light i like this low-key look thank you zach f for
[3414.06 --> 3420.30]  the heads up that we that we screwed up that part i don't personally i don't want to yeah i don't
[3420.30 --> 3425.26]  personally see them really talked about this tips thing and any of their mainline stuff but we absolutely
[3425.26 --> 3429.90]  should have read the the caption regardless that makes a lot more sense that doesn't make a lot more
[3429.90 --> 3435.58]  sense don't threaten interrogate or promise or spy on your employees that makes sense because they were
[3435.58 --> 3440.70]  we did talk about how they were talking about things not to do got a phone call from the dentist here
[3440.70 --> 3444.94]  nice that's important just gonna let that one ring out don't have a voicemail anymore that's a
[3444.94 --> 3448.62]  little update i don't know if i ever talked about that on wancho but i talked to linus about it
[3449.42 --> 3454.06]  because he was saying you know how you get these notifications for voicemail and they just don't
[3454.06 --> 3458.94]  go away you can't clear them yes i hate that i absolutely hate it and then you go to check your
[3458.94 --> 3463.98]  voicemail and if you're someone like me who doesn't pay msp until like because it just comes off your
[3463.98 --> 3469.74]  tax return anyway so there's no reason anyway i always have a full voicemail and then so linus
[3469.74 --> 3476.38]  said that he had a colleague in the past i think at ncix who said his voicemail was literally hi this
[3476.38 --> 3483.02]  is the voicemail of blah blah do not leave a message here email me or send me a text do not leave a
[3483.02 --> 3489.98]  message here and i thought that sounds like an okay thing to do but my voicemail is always full of scams
[3489.98 --> 3495.82]  and of msp who's gonna leave a message anyway so that wasn't gonna work so i just got it completely
[3495.82 --> 3503.58]  removed my life is better all right there you go i uh i just do direct withdrawal on msp yeah because
[3503.58 --> 3510.46]  i don't want to think about it yeah ever i did that before i think but whatever i like your style too
[3510.46 --> 3516.62]  though i think one of those two are probably the way to go evade yeah pay it or dodge it no you're still
[3516.62 --> 3519.90]  paying it eventually paid yeah yeah you're still paying it you have to anyway
[3519.90 --> 3525.10]  yeah so sorry about that inaccuracy thank you for checking us on that thank you very much and
[3525.10 --> 3532.22]  i'm happy that's i'm happy that's fixed now um is there more super chats to read probably are we like
[3532.22 --> 3539.26]  how much yeah i guess we've been going for almost our allotted time i don't know how to check the super
[3539.26 --> 3546.38]  chats though so can you talk to me about this uh playstation cross-platform playing fortnight's the
[3546.38 --> 3551.26]  first uh game you can play a cross-platform from your playstation yeah so here uh you talk about
[3551.26 --> 3555.66]  that i'm gonna try to figure out super chats okay well i'll give the notes but i actually wanted to
[3555.66 --> 3562.38]  hear your like your take on it i will i will comment on it cool so finally um sony interactive
[3562.38 --> 3567.50]  entertainment says it has identified a path towards supporting cross-platform features for third-party
[3567.50 --> 3573.34]  content so the first step is going to be an open beta which is on now for the game fortnight of course
[3573.34 --> 3580.30]  that will allow cross-platform gameplay progression and commerce across the playstation 4 android ios
[3580.30 --> 3587.26]  nintendo switch xbox one microsoft windows and mac operating systems uh i think
[3589.34 --> 3594.94]  um i think this is weird like aren't you just gonna get pwned by people with keyboard and mouse
[3594.94 --> 3602.86]  um i think to a certain to a certain degree i think people almost don't care but in this in a battle
[3602.86 --> 3608.86]  royale where like if you're the third one left alive and then you get wrecked and you're you're just
[3608.86 --> 3612.14]  gonna like ah you're gonna rage quit and you're gonna that guy definitely has a keyboard and mouse
[3614.06 --> 3619.66]  yeah i wonder if there's a way to queue cross-platform and a way to queue not cross-platform if that makes
[3619.66 --> 3624.78]  sense yeah i i wonder that as well but i can find any information on that because i would still like to be a
[3624.78 --> 3630.30]  ability to play with my buddy so like if my buddy has a ps4 and i for some reason wanted to play fortnight
[3630.30 --> 3636.86]  um i'd like to play with him i think it would probably make sense if we had to queue for the pc queue
[3637.34 --> 3644.22]  yeah i think it would be segregated because you'd have to bring up the i don't know how to say this
[3645.10 --> 3652.86]  not as tactile experiences yeah like if if you wanted to you would have to buff them yeah well well
[3652.86 --> 3657.34]  not you'd actually have to hurt them or nerf the other one yeah because you wouldn't it would be
[3657.34 --> 3663.66]  it would be kind of brutal i think to bring a pc player into a console only environment yeah by
[3663.66 --> 3668.22]  inviting him to your group but if you're gonna have to go the other way oh yeah it would have to bring
[3668.22 --> 3674.94]  up someone it's like it's your decision to queue with a pc player so you have to go play against pc
[3674.94 --> 3680.30]  people you know what i mean if you want to play mobile fortnight i don't know if this is a thing
[3680.30 --> 3685.26]  probably it is if you want to play well no but if you want to play mobile fortnight with a pc player
[3685.26 --> 3691.18]  yeah i think just gonna get so wrecked and the thing that's interesting is that the game developers
[3691.18 --> 3695.50]  are pushing it for this for a long time sorry i have no idea what like the fortnight cross
[3695.50 --> 3699.58]  platform queuing stuff is i'm just saying that would make more sense to me game developers not
[3699.58 --> 3704.06]  just a fortnight but of other games have won a cross platform for a long time because they just
[3704.06 --> 3708.54]  want more and more people to play their game but obviously the the console makers like microsoft and
[3708.54 --> 3713.82]  sony they have the opposite incentive they want people to be silo siloed so i wonder if you're
[3713.82 --> 3717.50]  playing and you're getting wrecked by someone with a keyboard and mouse and you really care about the
[3717.50 --> 3723.18]  game you're thinking well i gotta switch to pc because i want to kick ass with a keyboard and
[3723.18 --> 3728.62]  mouse do you think there's a fortnight will already cue keyboard and mouse apart from controller unless
[3728.62 --> 3733.74]  you're grouped with friends so they're doing this so you can be on your pc on a controller well yeah
[3733.74 --> 3741.50]  yeah but the game recognizes that and that's how they oh that would make sense i think because
[3741.50 --> 3747.58]  there's no real advantage there yeah a little bit of frame rate or like hertz like refresh rate
[3748.14 --> 3754.30]  stuff but yeah okay that's cool but do you hear what i'm saying like if i'm playing and then someone
[3754.30 --> 3758.54]  wrecks me with a mouse and i'm like why am i playing on console i'm just gonna move to pc and then i'm no
[3758.54 --> 3763.10]  longer a sony places and customer i don't think that's really gonna happen because
[3765.34 --> 3768.70]  if if they're already splitting the cues for controllers and keyboard and mouse unless you're
[3768.70 --> 3774.78]  in a group then the only reason why you're being being brought to play with other people with keyboard
[3774.78 --> 3779.50]  and mouse is because you're playing with one of your friends yeah and the amount of people that are
[3779.50 --> 3785.66]  going to be in that niche group and then also care enough to buy a whole nother platform yeah it's
[3785.66 --> 3790.22]  gonna be really small you've also already got the sunk cost of you bought your places already
[3790.22 --> 3795.50]  so maybe on the next gen you don't buy the next gen you buy pc instead maybe and i think playstation
[3795.50 --> 3801.58]  is is making so many people happy with this change and it's honestly they might open the door for a
[3801.58 --> 3807.26]  lot more people to buy playstations because if if one if someone's like yeah i only play on freaking pc
[3807.26 --> 3813.66]  because my friends play on pc and i want to play a bunch of the really good single player experiences
[3813.66 --> 3820.30]  on playstation like god of war uh horizon zero dawn spider-man all these really good single-player
[3820.30 --> 3823.74]  experiences they could buy a playstation and still play with their friends it won't be an optimal
[3823.74 --> 3829.42]  experience or you're playing on mobile and you want to get more into it but you can't afford a gaming pc
[3830.06 --> 3834.86]  get a console yeah still play with your mobile friends i i think it's a very good move for playstation
[3834.86 --> 3839.10]  i'm very happy with it we don't know right now what the future holds for other games other than
[3839.10 --> 3844.62]  fortnite getting this they haven't announced that at all so people are also bringing up that you can
[3844.62 --> 3853.02]  keyboard and mouse on on playstation it's not the same but yeah um to go through some super chats uh
[3854.78 --> 3859.18]  someone asked is ltx i'm not going to go through all of them by the way but i'll do but we will thank
[3859.18 --> 3863.26]  and acknowledge all of you thank you yes thank you very much you're super i'll go through some notable

[3868.78 --> 3875.26]  want to say a definitive thing um but i suspect roughly yeah i suspect it'll be somewhere around
[3875.26 --> 3880.54]  that area i don't know if it'll actually be mid-july but like yeah someone if you're booking off time
[3881.26 --> 3885.58]  yeah if you're booking on time don't um we don't even know which country it's going to be in right
[3885.58 --> 3894.94]  now yeah to be honest who knows but like it it will probably be summer ish so yeah uh you guys are
