[0.00 → 8.08] yeah and we're back at you with another weigh-in show how's it going hope your day's
[8.08 → 13.68] been great we got some news for you such news intel invests a billion dollars to meet 14
[13.68 → 21.68] nanometre demand this year billion dollars also the Amazon anti-union video has leaked they sent
[21.68 → 28.08] it to whole foods or something controversial Elon Musk getting sued not by some little
[28.08 → 34.96] backyard yokel either by the sec securities and exchange commission because you know he's been
[34.96 → 41.28] fraudulent yeah we'll get into that no sex no drugs no violence no money from me then
[42.64 → 47.04] on apple's streaming service we'll talk about that later as well it's time for the intro
[48.96 → 49.60] oh man
[58.96 → 61.68] ohh Chris
[66.08 → 83.92] remember soundboard
[83.92 → 89.06] so bad to the people who are getting called if you have the soundboard you're sitting there you
[89.06 → 94.50] got your computer speaker up to the phone you're just going hi how are you I'm a copy with you
[94.50 → 98.46] and the person you're losing it you're losing it the person on the phone's like
[98.46 → 106.60] huh like it sounds bad like a terrible speaker recording what's happening I used to love um
[106.60 → 114.70] what was it called so there was the ventral voice service I used to love ventral is that like
[114.70 → 121.38] you type in, and it speaks out no, no no this is like before discord I think team speak I don't
[121.38 → 126.34] know if team speak was around when ventral was originally around but like they eventually became
[126.34 → 130.34] like the two platforms for a while and then people kind of left ventral, and it was team to speak for a
[130.34 → 133.78] while and then skype and all this other kind of stuff came around, and the discord finally got rid
[133.78 → 139.14] of Skype and all that junk but back in the day there was ventral the name is ringing a bell i
[139.14 → 145.70] just don't know and one of my favourite things used to be because you could bind keys on your keyboard
[145.70 → 154.08] to soundboard to play through that's if you were saying so it totally got rid of that like quality
[154.08 → 157.62] issue that you were just talking about yeah and people could get like you could have a levels issue
[157.62 → 162.20] still you could but if people like tone it and all that kind of stuff and there was people who would
[162.20 → 169.32] do ventral pranks um oh yeah that's oh wait is that the one the duke nuke one yes yeah yeah yeah
[169.32 → 173.26] this was amazing yeah yeah yeah ventral harassment yeah that's what they call it duke nuke style
[173.26 → 180.50] you're going to put that on your screen put it up uh yeah there's a famous one and child pranks this
[180.50 → 187.58] duke nuke style one was huge ah okay the person he's talking to on that one is it nine million views
[187.58 → 192.40] and this was uploaded in 2007 is that a boy or a girl this was big that he's talking to you, I don't
[192.40 → 197.46] I always thought it was a young boy well I think it's a girl we can't, you know people knows people uh
[197.46 → 201.10] isn't there a name for the person like Debbie or something I don't know
[201.10 → 209.02] whoa all right we're not going to play it I'm here to chew gum
[209.02 → 215.86] oh I love that everyone should watch that person's angry, but there 's's some really
[215.86 → 222.02] good ones one of my favourite one is just someone has a soundboard of this like random girl just
[222.02 → 227.76] talking about nothing important, and it was my favourite because he would just jump into channels
[227.76 → 233.98] and you know like the classic nerd like oh my god it's a girl yeah oh, and it would just be like
[233.98 → 239.54] yeah like on Fridays sometimes me and my friends will like to go to the store and I'll like buy a
[239.54 → 245.88] chocolate bar and everyone's like oh yeah that's so cool it was oh man I have heard that I just used
[245.88 → 250.10] to love it one time we were pranking people with the soundboards, and we're just about done and then
[250.10 → 254.76] my friend goes one more one more, and he dials it in, and we're using a soundboard from the
[254.76 → 262.46] movie phone booth okay yeah it was a Kiefer Sutherland movie with uh Colin fit not Colin Farrell right
[262.46 → 268.94] is that his name will Farrell Colin Farrell Colin fort no, no Colin fort there's a dude from pride
[268.94 → 273.12] and prejudice anyway the movie is there's a dude in a phone booth and then yeah the guy he's talking
[273.12 → 277.08] on the phone allegedly has a sniper rifle pointed at him so he stays in the phone booth the whole time
[277.08 → 283.46] yeah, so there's a soundboard based on that, and it's a creepy soundboard, and we call this person and
[283.46 → 288.94] it's a woman who answers and then the soundboard's real creepy it's saying like Colin Farrell yeah I have a
[288.94 → 293.80] 32 calibres or like semi-automatic sniper rifle pointed directly at you like oh my goodness
[293.80 → 299.04] obviously gun nuts I don't know guns that's like stats are wrong or whatever, but it's terrible
[299.04 → 304.16] you could have gotten a lot of trouble for this and um so okay it's like mildly funny we prank this
[304.16 → 309.70] person we hang up a little while later so as soon as I tell you what happens next you're gonna
[309.70 → 315.36] understand what happened but I didn't understand for weeks a few weeks later or a while later my mom
[315.36 → 322.20] was like your friends tell your friends not to call here or like someone some creep called me
[322.20 → 326.56] and told me all this stuff and I was like shut up mom what are you talking about and then I was like
[326.56 → 334.56] my buddy I pranked my own mom my friend typed in my mom's number and I didn't even I remember
[334.56 → 340.82] I remember when she picked up thinking like do I know that person but I didn't I didn't actually
[340.82 → 346.04] recognize the voice and uh yeah I pranked my own mom and then I didn't even realize
[346.04 → 349.66] oh my there are so many points in the story where I could have realized
[349.66 → 356.04] that's hilarious yeah it was pretty bad anyway actual topics if you want to go down an awesome
[356.04 → 360.86] hilarious rabbit hole on YouTube, and you don't mind some bad language because sometimes the
[360.86 → 365.86] people reacting get pretty angry check out ventral harassment hilarious some of them suck but some of
[365.86 → 371.28] them are hilarious but here's the other thing about my mom she thought it was real she didn't
[371.28 → 376.78] know it was a soundboard like everybody else she thought like she may not have thought that that was
[376.78 → 380.86] actually happening to her, but she thought that she was talking to a person not a soundboard so i
[380.86 → 382.08] remember being like
[382.08 → 390.36] doesn't make sense all right anyway real news my favourite one if you guys can find it is uh a guy's
[390.36 → 396.68] talking in wow and one of his friends records him talking over ventral and just plays back
[396.68 → 401.72] himself talking just to like mess with him and there was one part where he goes like I think it's
[401.72 → 407.64] like three strength like three strength three strand leather belt and then goes like and the guy
[407.64 → 413.16] recorded like that weird his like weird voice thing at the end and his statement and just constantly
[413.16 → 417.30] played it back to him just drives him nuts my it's hilarious now that you say that it all makes sense
[417.30 → 421.12] I have a friend who used to say those words all the time and I never knew what it was from the
[421.12 → 425.56] leather belt thing yeah yeah what are you saying hilarious this is like a decade ago it's I haven't
[425.56 → 429.90] heard it in probably yeah like 10 years so I don't remember the exact line, but it's something like that
[429.90 → 434.22] there's all those you ever have those weird memes that like you say for years and years and then you
[434.22 → 440.34] don't even like i I'm not even sure if I saw this video but one thing I still say once in a while is
[440.34 → 450.90] oh my god I love the map dust it's just like a same deal but from CS yeah like what level 18
[450.90 → 459.26] four strength two stem leather belt yeah there we go heck yeah I love it anyway uh the intel
[459.26 → 468.06] they invest a billion dollars to meet 14 nanometre demand bob swan intel CFO and interim CEO if you
[468.06 → 473.36] watch previous wan shows you'll know that the CEO left the company uh issued an open letter to the
[473.36 → 479.36] company's customers and partners today in the letter he addressed light uh tight supply on some
[479.36 → 484.76] of the company's products mainly their lower end entry level stuff they admit it outlining the set
[484.76 → 491.54] of actions intel is taking to tackle this problem he said uh the that there is a surprising return to
[491.54 → 496.64] pc tam or the total addressable market like the amount of people interested in buying as far as I know
[496.64 → 501.98] um there 's's yeah there 's's pc tam growth which there hasn't been since I believe
[501.98 → 508.36] yeah 2011 it's modest growth modest like in his letter he cites all these different stats of like
[508.36 → 514.24] our cloud computing business grew 25 this year something else grew 43, but then they don't say
[514.24 → 519.46] what the pc business grew they just say I think modest growth I think the point isn't necessarily that
[519.46 → 524.90] it's like oh it's so huge it's that it's growing at all we haven't had any pc tam growth uh since 20
[524.90 → 529.36] so for like the last seven years so that's that that is a pretty big deal regardless, and it wasn't
[529.36 → 534.32] expected as it hasn't happened in seven years and a lot of speculators have been saying that it wouldn't
[534.90 → 541.08] uh, but they're thinking that it's just it's fairly natural it's from the interest of people into
[541.08 → 545.26] gaming and all these other things well the spin that he puts on is that like they're doing such a
[545.26 → 550.92] dang good job that people are so interested in the new CPUs that everybody wants to upgrade totally man
[550.92 → 557.30] yeah that's definitely it maybe it's just that everyone's 2600ks are just finally getting too old
[557.30 → 567.90] maybe that's it um there's also intel is also uh prioritizing production of Leon and core processors
[567.90 → 573.78] uh to serve the high performance segments of the market we'll get into why that matters later um and
[573.78 → 579.04] supply in general is tight particularly like we already said in the uh entry-level pc market intel
[579.04 → 585.18] believes they have at least the supply to meet the full year revenue outlook expected in July which
[585.18 → 592.64] was 4.5 billion higher than their January expectations, so this reassurance study issued
[592.64 → 597.46] everybody um apparently has inspired confidence because their stock price went up like between
[597.46 → 603.34] three and five percent at the same time that AIDS went down so it appears to be a zero-sum game
[603.34 → 611.08] um so I guess intel went from like 45 to 47 and then AMD went from 33 to 30 or something like that
[611.08 → 616.72] last time I checked that was a few hours ago though so I guess it's its good people believe the bops
[616.72 → 621.86] one but why don't we break down just exactly what's happening here from a manufacturing perspective
[621.86 → 631.26] uh so when you're running in a fab there's a certain amount of wafers of CPU cores you can make
[631.26 → 636.24] or dyes you can make uh per month essentially that's your output is how many of these wafers
[636.24 → 642.18] you can put out per month and a CPU that has way more cores on it is like literally going to physically
[642.18 → 647.58] take up more of that wafer right so if they want to one wafer is going to have fewer
[647.58 → 653.76] dyes on it if they want to have these bigger CPUs which they are because they're worth more money to
[653.76 → 659.96] them where they get more profit and there is an increase of demand for those CPUs I think AMD has done a
[659.96 → 666.36] great job of marketing uh CPUs with higher core counts which is great because that's awesome because
[666.36 → 672.50] I think everyone wants that and people are jumping on board and wanting intel's version of those kind
[672.50 → 677.78] of high core count CPUs as well which is increasing demand and taking up more space on these wafers
[677.78 → 685.60] right you also brought up something earlier which is where like um if you take up uh like you need
[685.60 → 690.98] a block so if you take up a corner yeah it's like if you had a bucket, and you're filling it with Lego
[690.98 → 695.94] and you had those giant Lego pieces you might only get like eight of them in your bucket yeah but if
[695.94 → 701.40] you had the same as weight of Lego blocks, but they were tiny pieces you could, they would all just
[701.40 → 707.88] fit in so much more nicely which is why they're going to mix up like there's the binning process and
[707.88 → 711.78] they're going to mix up like they're going to have some of the smaller ones edging out corners and the bigger
[711.78 → 716.58] ones and stuff but as you put more of these bigger ones in you're reducing the over amount the overall
[716.58 → 721.20] amount of real estate like the absolute number of cores you can put on a wafer is reduced when
[721.20 → 725.24] the die size is bigger, but they're you're saying they're going to mix them up have you ever seen one
[725.24 → 729.96] of those cross-sections I used to work at a place in forestry, and they had a poster on the wall that
[729.96 → 734.98] showed a cross-section of like I guess it was like a lumber industry poster oh like how they
[734.98 → 739.62] showed a log like you cut a log down, and they showed all the little like two by fours a two by four
[739.62 → 745.02] go there and a four by six will come out of the middle yeah that might be relatable to you, I love
[745.02 → 750.16] those like explosion things yeah whatever what's that either way when that well when you take like
[750.16 → 755.38] a car or a log oh yeah case or whatever, and you explode it you pull all the parts apart so you can
[755.38 → 760.14] see like where everything is and stuff it's cool um I think I know what poster you're talking about i
[760.14 → 764.94] think I've seen the same thing oh really yeah I don't know every kid yeah yeah had that on their wall
[764.94 → 773.32] we're all from like forest land Canada um so yeah each wafer can have multiple CV's as we're
[773.32 → 777.78] saying uh blah blah blah this is just a bunch of what we were just saying yeah so all of that is on
[777.78 → 784.16] on the 14 nanometre die so they are trying to allocate yeah yeah the 14 nanometre node I should
[784.16 → 791.36] say, and they're trying to get as many of the fabs on the 14 nanometre node to produce these high-end
[791.36 → 797.30] core i9 and Leon 28 core chips what happened because of that was that the low end of the market
[797.30 → 808.66] like what is it the hcl3 yeah no h310c Jesus that lower end chip got the shaft because it's on the
[808.66 → 813.70] same node, but it's not getting any priority because it doesn't make them as much money so in order to
[813.70 → 819.06] meet demand for that they made a completely new node a 22 nanometre version just to get the supply up
[819.06 → 824.56] of that meanwhile they're still trying to focus on the 10 nanometre node which they say they're
[824.56 → 830.66] making gains on I don't think that they're gonna they can't afford to not spend money on that yeah
[830.66 → 839.14] so this new billion dollars um that's just on top of it's on top of 14 billion that they
[839.14 → 844.56] already they already put out for cap expenditure in 2018, so this total of 15 billion is actual record
[844.56 → 850.62] and these billion dollars can be put into the various fabs in Oregon Arizona Ireland and Israel
[850.62 → 860.58] that produce on the 14 nanometre node is it crazy how much is that going to make a difference is it a lot
[860.58 → 865.82] no one knows how they're spending the money yeah that's the thing yeah and where's the money coming
[865.82 → 871.28] from is it just uh in their own coffers I mean probably do they do you think they had just enough
[871.28 → 875.84] like revenue kicking around do they have to take a shareholder dividends I don't it do
[875.84 → 879.80] this is probably reallocated it from a different cash in the bank
[879.80 → 888.40] just like okay we'll just we'll just drop a cool billion boom yeah I'm sure I'm sure they've got
[888.40 → 892.20] money in reserve and if they're like hey we need to crank up production because we're just going to
[892.20 → 897.58] make a ton of money because we'll sell everything that we make if we crank up production with a billion
[897.58 → 902.64] dollars then that's a pretty safe bet I guess if they're like we are not going to be able to produce
[902.64 → 907.16] enough it's low risk supply yeah exactly and if they're and if they're like hey we can spend a
[907.16 → 912.36] billion dollars and that will make it so that we can produce enough to match the demands then they're
[912.36 → 916.48] just like hey well we just get to sell a whole crap ton more CPUs yeah and make up the money they
[916.48 → 919.84] must have the money sitting around because if they is it was the case that they had to like
[919.84 → 925.40] sell back their own stock then you would have seen the stock price dip and that didn't happen so it
[925.40 → 930.10] can't be that you know this is one of my favourite things to look up you're googling what are you
[930.10 → 937.14] googling how much money does Nintendo have in the bank oh that's only as of 2015 though so nobody can
[937.14 → 942.38] see what you're looking at no I know I just wanted to look up the number um so like one of my favourite
[942.38 → 947.72] things to talk about every once in a while is Nintendo because Nintendo um I suspect compared to
[947.72 → 957.12] intel they're a relatively small company in terms of uh capex or uh market cap capital
[957.12 → 964.30] expenditure as well for sure um probably even literally just like employees um I don't know
[964.30 → 969.20] but i I'm assuming their a much smaller company we can look this up yeah, but people will always talk
[969.20 → 974.24] about like during the Wii U phase yeah Nintendo is very spiky um and during the Wii U phase people
[974.24 → 978.26] are always talking about like is Nintendo even going to survive, but they've got so much money in
[978.26 → 987.38] the bank what like you can see my jaw dropped is Nintendo way bigger no Nintendo had from the fiscal
[987.38 → 997.82] year 2010 to 2018 Nintendo okay Nintendo had a total of 5500 employees 5500 employees dude cactus club has
[997.82 → 1005.42] 5 000 employees and no one in the U.S. even knows where that is that a Canadian only company yeah
[1005.42 → 1011.16] yeah yeah okay like they're they're a pretty lean company, and they've got billions in the bank
[1011.16 → 1017.12] and people will be like oh we use doing bad is Nintendo going to die it's like no dude I can't remember
[1017.12 → 1022.00] what the stats are, but there's something like if Nintendo just immediately stops selling everything
[1022.00 → 1028.24] now and keeps their capital expenditure at the same amount and just makes no money at all they
[1028.24 → 1032.84] could survive for like a hundred years or something it's like you guys they're doing all right it seems
[1032.84 → 1037.82] like a natural fit because their products are always so bold and risky like they don't when they reach
[1037.82 → 1041.40] when they launch the Wii they have no idea if people are going to like it or not and same with the
[1041.40 → 1045.60] switch it's completely out there it seems like you better have some money for a rainy day yeah because
[1045.60 → 1051.38] they do, and then they've done really well enough times that they've just got all this money that
[1051.38 → 1054.10] they can sit on and keep taking risks which is cool it's one of the reasons why I love Nintendo
[1054.10 → 1061.32] that is cool so what is tactic club cat what is cat it's just a cactus club it's just a restaurant
[1061.32 → 1067.60] in Canada hold on I'm going to get the numbers I'm on Wikipedia now, and it confirmed 5500 for
[1067.60 → 1075.14] Nintendo's employee number until 106 000 yeah so that's what I said like drastically different
[1075.14 → 1083.06] style company and even Nintendo could drop that billion and be completely fine I think IBM has
[1083.06 → 1090.04] 800 000 if I remember correctly no 300 380 000 which is that means there's more people in the world
[1090.04 → 1097.68] working for IBM than holding Icelandic passports there are fewer Icelanders than IBM employees
[1097.68 → 1102.64] there might be some overlap there I wonder how many Icelandic IBM employees there are hit us up on
[1102.64 → 1109.12] super chat yeah if you're an Icelandic IBM employee toss us some of that old school computer money yeah
[1109.12 → 1115.96] give us them that model m money yeah from the north are we done this topic yeah okay we're gonna
[1115.96 → 1122.16] move on I think so we did it I think uh did we talk about the 22 nanometre stuff yeah and the stock
[1122.16 → 1130.14] changes yeah cool I think we're good yeah moving on uh Amazon has an anti-union video that has
[1130.14 → 1137.50] leaked allegedly because it only sort of leaked its sort of leaked so Gizmodo broke the story okay
[1137.50 → 1145.84] and they say that they obtained a video from anonymous sources they posted screenshots at Gizmodo but they
[1145.84 → 1151.76] did not post the video themselves because they say that they post the video that it will compromise
[1151.76 → 1157.88] the people who leaked it so they have they themselves have reached out to Amazon to ask Amazon to publish
[1157.88 → 1166.38] the video that's not going to happen correct, and also it's kind of fishy because it is fishy it's kind of
[1166.38 → 1175.30] like political then because Amazon has its enemies' oh yeah like in business and in politics so that's
[1175.30 → 1180.94] interesting okay let's get it let's just let's just unwrap yeah what this is news site Gizmodo has
[1180.94 → 1187.34] obtained what it calls a 45-minute union busting training video so Amazon uses training videos all
[1187.34 → 1191.90] the time like carbonized animated videos to train management and lower level employees and everything
[1191.90 → 1199.62] yeah um allegedly this video was produced I think by Amazon and then sent to team leaders of whole foods
[1199.62 → 1205.46] last week and whole foods of course is owned by Amazon now they sold them or Amazon bought whole foods
[1205.46 → 1212.42] for 13 billion last year about a year point seven billion dollars less than WhatsApp was worth to Facebook
[1212.42 → 1221.20] yeah that was 16 um so the video's narrator states that the video is specifically designed to give you
[1221.20 → 1225.80] the manager of whole foods the tools that you need for success when it comes to labour organizing
[1225.80 → 1231.88] so it all well I'll go over some of the other stuff that it also states it also says we are not
[1231.88 → 1238.36] anti-union, but we are not neutral either I have no idea what that's supposed to that means you're anti-union
[1238.36 → 1244.72] yeah pretty much uh we do not believe quote unquote this is not me saying this quote unquote we do not
[1244.72 → 1251.82] believe unions are in the best interest of our customers our shareholders or most importantly our associates
[1251.82 → 1258.06] meaning employees yeah associates are employees our business model is built upon speed innovation and customer
[1258.06 → 1265.10] obsession things that are generally not associated with union uh when we lose sight of those critical focus areas
[1265.10 → 1272.14] we jeopardize everyone's job security yours mine and the associates, so the video provides some
[1272.14 → 1279.18] background on the neighbour or the national labour relations act as well as showing some like different warning signs
[1279.18 → 1285.66] so if you are a manager at this whole foods, and you see any of the following you might have a potential
[1285.66 → 1291.58] union not like unfolding in your hands are about to erupt so warning signs such as use of words like living
[1291.58 → 1299.98] wage and steward distribution of petitions and flyers associates raising concerns on behalf of their co-workers
[1299.98 → 1307.50] that's a big one well oh or even more blatant wearing union t-shirts hats or jackets workers who aren't normally
[1307.50 → 1311.98] connected to each other suddenly hanging out together don't make friends with people that you're not
[1311.98 → 1318.38] already friends with okay any other associate behaviour that is out of character that's a little
[1318.38 → 1323.98] police state that's I try to like i I try to make it so that people at filming are friends because I want
[1323.98 → 1328.22] everyone to be friendly maybe I'm doing the wrong thing well if it comes from the top then it's its not
[1328.22 → 1334.30] a warning sign right okay good call the video then asked managers to listen to 10 hypothetical employees
[1334.30 → 1339.10] and select whether their remarks constitute a warning sign or an innocent interaction
[1340.70 → 1345.90] um so they say they, and then they talk about um what you're allowed to speak so what you're allowed
[1345.90 → 1351.42] to say to employees that is legal so apparently basically anything goes um there's nothing really
[1351.42 → 1357.10] unlawful that you can say in regard to unionizing, but they still give you some guidelines such as you
[1357.10 → 1361.42] would never threaten to close your building just because associates joined a union
[1361.42 → 1367.26] but you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation which in turn
[1367.90 → 1372.86] could hurt customer obsession which ultimately could threaten the building's continued existence
[1376.94 → 1383.58] potential organization uh are supposed to be escalated oh yeah so if you see this happening at
[1383.58 → 1388.38] your store you're supposed to escalate this to human resources and general managers immediately
[1388.38 → 1396.14] quash it nips it in the bud the video itself does not appear to be publicly available online as we
[1396.14 → 1400.54] already uh yeah I tried to go to live leak and stuff like that it might be on now this was like five
[1400.54 → 1405.66] hours ago but yeah it doesn't appear to be available uh Gizmodo like he already said asked Amazon to publish
[1405.66 → 1411.10] the video and yeah basically the rest of it is just what was already spoken about so you have a
[1411.10 → 1418.22] you have a hot take I have some problems with this okay, okay full disclosure first unions are awesome
[1418.22 → 1425.66] those lights just sometimes died they're really, really important when you need a union you need a union
[1425.66 → 1433.58] I'm not anti-union at all but I'm also not pro-union it depends in an ideal world
[1433.58 → 1439.02] there'd be no unions because in an ideal world every employer would treat would it would treat their
[1439.02 → 1445.98] employees really well now the fact that this story when you read about it like I had to
[1445.98 → 1451.42] really scrutinize this article to figure out like oh this is actually talking about whole foods
[1451.42 → 1456.62] it's not talking about Amazon oh because it's it only says that like in one place near the top and one
[1456.62 → 1460.78] place near the bottom and the rest is it talks about Amazon's track record of like people peeing in
[1460.78 → 1466.14] bottles or Amazon yeah there's been some pretty brutal news out of Amazon yeah and everyone knows Amazon
[1466.14 → 1471.90] sucks in that way or has and especially if you're a low-end employee yeah and that level that they
[1471.90 → 1476.22] dodge paying taxes and that they like kind of strong arm the cities that they operate in to give
[1476.22 → 1481.66] them favourable like subsidies and tax exemptions and stuff like that so they're really focused on
[1481.66 → 1487.34] having an on benefiting the customer they're obsessed with the customer at the expense of other things
[1487.34 → 1494.54] like employee happiness, but this is about whole foods and whole foods has its own CEO, and you know i
[1494.54 → 1499.74] I guess ostensibly like its own practices and stuff I don't know how entangled those two companies are
[1499.74 → 1508.30] but that's just one thing I wanted to keep in mind um obviously it would definitely be the
[1508.30 → 1513.74] case that Amazon just like other big retailers like Walmart or whoever a target who have been
[1513.74 → 1518.94] scrutinized for this in the past it would be terrible if they had their workers unionized I don't think
[1518.94 → 1523.34] it would be that bad for whole foods it'd be worse for Amazon if they got you their workers got you
[1523.34 → 1531.26] yeah because I think a lot would have to change um i I have only ever personally been in one union
[1531.90 → 1536.30] I thought you're going to say in one whole foods uh I think that might also be true
[1537.34 → 1541.82] uh there's a did you like nature's fair near here which is essentially the same thing I've been in
[1541.82 → 1546.62] there a bunch of times that's like local all right yeah have you did you like working in a union no i
[1546.62 → 1551.26] freaking hated it um but I may have that my problem is that I've only worked in one
[1552.14 → 1561.26] and my case was relatively unique I guess um where I worked at a bread factory I worked at Canada bread
[1561.26 → 1567.82] factory you're a wholesome guy very wholesome you're a whole wheat oh yeah we made some of that um by the
[1567.82 → 1573.58] way basically all the bread and somewhere like Walmart all comes from the same spot and is made the same way
[1573.58 → 1578.78] and just gets put in different bags it's great uh anyway i I used to work there we were all in a
[1578.78 → 1585.18] union it was a multi whatever union where like it oversaw a bunch of different types of workers
[1585.18 → 1590.22] yeah like where we live there's the bc get it's the biggest union and then that covers like everyone
[1590.22 → 1595.82] from prison guards to firefighters yeah yeah yeah this wasn't that one, but it was a different
[1595.82 → 1601.10] form of a similar thing where it's a bunch of different disciplines uh and our union guy I guess the
[1601.10 → 1604.94] steward from reading this for our factory was a
[1607.50 → 1615.10] expletive ah I hated that dude you hated him with everything I've got uh I had to pay union dues when
[1615.10 → 1620.70] all I'm trying to do is make money to go to school and this guy was just a big jerk and none of the
[1620.70 → 1624.46] people I didn't know a single person that worked there that liked him and there was nothing we could
[1624.46 → 1629.98] really do about it um the people above him in the union that we tried to contact wouldn't get rid of
[1629.98 → 1637.42] him so we had like the same problem that you would have with like some jerk boss oh yeah within the
[1637.42 → 1642.94] union and I had to pay him to be a jerk to me and I was like this freaking sucks do unions ever go away
[1643.50 → 1648.06] like once they don't know I don't know enough about it, I don't really personally want to comment too
[1648.06 → 1653.18] much on this because I really don't know enough about it, I just had one singular bad experience and i
[1653.18 → 1658.38] haven't been in a union outside of that so I really don't know I do know from like history that there's
[1658.38 → 1665.10] been multiple times when unions were absolutely necessary completely to solve a giant major problem
[1665.10 → 1669.50] but then do they ever go away after that that's the that's the thing I don't I don't know I know
[1669.50 → 1673.50] quite a few people that don't like them I know quite a few people that do like them I know my experience
[1673.50 → 1679.34] sucked um yeah I worked for a union, and it was sweet for me because I made more money than I should
[1679.34 → 1684.62] have and uh that was great cool um I have a friend who's in a union again he's he actually is a corrections
[1684.62 → 1691.10] correctional officer okay prison guard and uh it sucks for him because the pay raises are completely
[1691.10 → 1695.26] just like regimented it's not like you kicked a lot of butt this year, and you're going to get a sweet
[1695.26 → 1700.06] pay raise it's like well you worked here this long, and we're they're renegotiating the union
[1700.06 → 1706.46] agreement this year, and we're all going to get six percent raise and that raise by the way that we're
[1706.46 → 1711.50] they're fighting for isn't for your particular job it's for like what you said a cross-section of
[1711.50 → 1715.26] different industries and everyone who fits in this bucket is getting the same raise even though
[1715.90 → 1720.06] you've got to deal with people stabbing each other and stuff I like my one of my problems was
[1720.62 → 1726.54] where I worked when you got hired they had to do a super basic math test
[1727.66 → 1734.22] and the super basic math test was good there are 24 slices in a low and then five loads that basically
[1734.22 → 1739.34] they're trying to see like how smart are you because there's like there's a position called bun
[1739.34 → 1746.06] packer that was great where you pick up stuff off a conveyor line you grab it you turn to the
[1746.06 → 1752.78] right you put it down you rotate back you grab it you turn to the right, and you put it your body get
[1752.78 → 1758.46] all the that's the whole job for eight hours a day oh so like that job can be done by anyone
[1758.46 → 1762.78] but then there's like the mixer who has to like to put in the ingredients and that's a little bit more
[1762.78 → 1766.46] specific and there's people who like to pack the trucks, and you have to put the right amount of
[1766.46 → 1770.06] carts of the right amount of stuff on the right trucks and there's like slightly more advanced
[1770.06 → 1775.82] jobs so you're a bun packer well everyone starts there regardless of how well you do did you ever
[1775.82 → 1782.70] leave the bun pack I did yeah I got moved up really fast and the union head didn't like that because the
[1783.58 → 1789.02] the non-union guys got to pick where you worked, but the union guys picked your hours so because I went
[1789.02 → 1795.02] up in position really quickly the union had just screwed me not in terms of he gave me really low hours but
[1795.02 → 1802.06] he would just wreck me like he'd shift me at like the worst possible times, and he'd always have me
[1802.06 → 1808.78] as like the emergency call guy oh so he'd be he'd be like to be there in 15 minutes uh, and he'd call me
[1808.78 → 1814.06] as I was trying to go to bed because it was purely on call and I was just like oh my god, and he made my
[1814.06 → 1818.30] life hell for an entire summer so I don't I don't like that, and then they have all those things like
[1818.94 → 1824.30] like uh promotions based on seniority and stuff yeah it's like god he's been here 20 years I don't care
[1824.30 → 1830.38] that's because he sucks yeah he has nothing else he has no other prospects everyone else good left
[1830.38 → 1835.02] so yeah I don't know I think there are situations where it can be bad and I think there are situations
[1835.02 → 1840.86] where it can be good and I have no idea for whole foods okay well here's my one last this is my tinfoil
[1840.86 → 1846.70] hat hot take sure yeah can you get the screenshot up from that article yes so if you open up the goat
[1846.70 → 1850.70] Gizmodo article they've got some embedded screen caps from this alleged video
[1850.70 → 1855.58] video just go to the first one just go through it just give me a sec guys I'll bring it
[1855.58 → 1861.10] we're going to go on a journey here actually that's the screenshot that I want I'm still going to go here
[1861.10 → 1864.06] because it'll probably be bigger yeah so we might as well give them
[1868.30 → 1872.22] living wage grievance contract representation is that what that last word is
[1872.22 → 1882.62] I want to go to the tips one tips yeah there's this one okay tips remember managers
[1882.62 → 1889.98] tips if you see someone uh trying to organize just remember t-i-p-s threaten interrogate promise and spy
[1891.66 → 1899.50] I have a hard time believing that any company that sounds so fake that is so egregious and outrageous
[1899.50 → 1905.58] that if that's true that's crazy, but there's its just so outrageous that it can't be true
[1906.14 → 1910.86] and then I see that I'm just like is this whole thing fake does this video even exist because that
[1910.86 → 1918.30] is just over the top threaten and interrogate come on as if promise what so like and
[1918.30 → 1922.94] are they telling you to lie because what do you promise I guess that's what that means but promise
[1922.94 → 1927.66] is the nicest word in there but can you imagine telling like all of this the executive executives are
[1927.66 → 1930.94] telling the management like sitting down the team leaders at whole foods which is like
[1930.94 → 1936.06] threaten and interrogate your employees yeah exactly there's no way they said that doesn't sound real
[1936.06 → 1945.02] come on so I think it's uh fake news I wonder if they got sourced something that seemed super
[1945.02 → 1950.46] legit, and then they just believed it is could be man the Russians that throws me off a lot to be
[1950.46 → 1955.34] honest because that sounds really you know what uh this interrogates thing made me think of
[1955.34 → 1962.06] uh one of my employees how's it going AJ uh he was mentioning in French uh the question mark
[1963.02 → 1970.46] it translates to interrogation mark oh interesting well there's an uh there's one he'll say interrogation
[1970.46 → 1975.42] mark when he's talking about question mark I'm like that's so intense yeah yeah yeah it's a weird
[1975.42 → 1980.86] translation there's an obscure form of punctuation that is a mix, but you know how when you wanted to ask
[1980.86 → 1985.10] a question intensely, and you use a question mark and an exclamation point yeah well there's a one
[1985.10 → 1992.14] unified really like notation it's called an interrobang I have heard that phrase but I didn't know that
[1992.14 → 2000.54] yes um there's actually a perfect episode of 99 invisible about it arrogant there's like a 99 invisible
[2000.54 → 2006.30] oh it's this awesome like design focused podcast yeah you should uh show everyone it looks pretty cool
[2006.30 → 2009.98] it does look cool I'll bring it up there's this dude who like championed it and like tried to make
[2009.98 → 2018.38] it happens really hard wait so it is it a thing or no um like is it officially recognized notation
[2018.38 → 2024.22] in interrobang I guess it's well it's not on the keyboard it ain't real
[2026.14 → 2032.22] kind of looks like a really powerful p it could be an alt code thing though interrobang alt code
[2032.22 → 2042.54] it has a Unicode yeah boy interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark
[2044.14 → 2049.90] few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character the standard interrobang
[2050.46 → 2059.50] is at Unicode code point u plus 203d are your sponsors rip yeah sponsor time
[2059.50 → 2064.78] do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[2064.78 → 2070.30] what is that Pink Panther that's no what is it oh god
[2073.34 → 2080.86] savage jerky they oh yeah gave us some mojo jalapeño hot sauce can I hold uh something
[2082.14 → 2085.98] for now because that's almost certainly going to come home with me and never come back you say mojo
[2085.98 → 2093.98] it's not mojo it's not mojo no it's not mojo jalapeño I said mojo forever, and then we got
[2093.98 → 2098.62] very much corrected by the twitch chat, and they're apparently correct I looked it up what does mojo
[2098.62 → 2106.62] mean in Spanish I don't know I'm going to look that up I know what Soho means what's what does Soho Bohemian
[2106.62 → 2119.42] in the interest world mojo Spanish pronunciation mono well I'm not going to try that uh yeah it's
[2119.42 → 2125.58] eating sauce yeah it just means some type of sauce okay we have ghost pepper uh buffalo sauce and sriracha
[2125.58 → 2132.06] bacon and original jerky here, and he's got mojo jalapeño which is so far my favourite jerky from savage
[2132.06 → 2136.62] jerky in sauce form so I'm super excited to try that at home because I'm definitely going to steal
[2136.62 → 2140.86] if it's not coming back unless someone tells me to bring it back in which case it will immediately
[2140.86 → 2145.66] come back uh their jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with
[2145.66 → 2150.46] the goal to create a snack that is full of flavour and spice and isn't bad for you all at the same time
[2151.02 → 2155.42] they have 13 different flavours uh which goes on top of the ones that we have here
[2155.42 → 2165.42] I left this world for a second there I'm like Pavlov's dog right now jazz uh they also include
[2165.42 → 2170.86] things like sriracha bacon uh which I have here and maple buffalo bacon and many others they also make
[2170.86 → 2176.70] barbecue sauce hot sauce and spice rub like the hot sauce mojo jalapeño that we have here uh their
[2176.70 → 2181.02] Carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world which is pretty crazy we don't
[2181.02 → 2188.54] have um I've tried the jerky and uh it's pretty brutal it's an experience I think I did the last
[2188.54 → 2193.90] show that Linus was on I ate one just nonchalant without telling him, and he didn't notice so I was
[2193.90 → 2198.38] pretty proud of that because usually I like sort of die when i eat it I remember it's on it was
[2198.38 → 2201.90] the first Sancho I was ever on I tried it and I tried to play real cool, and you're just sitting there
[2201.90 → 2209.98] and then suddenly like your pupils fill up with liquid it's like I'm cool yeah everything yeah
[2210.86 → 2217.10] it's blood coming out of my ears dude it's like it's pretty, pretty normal one thing from coming
[2217.10 → 2223.26] from someone who enjoys spice I like spice but to a limit like once it gets to his once it gets past
[2223.26 → 2227.74] my limit it becomes not fun that's everyone in the world dude no there's some people that enjoy the
[2227.74 → 2233.18] pain oh there's absolutely people that enjoy the masochists I think my dad is one of those people
[2233.18 → 2239.58] because my dad will eat any hot sauce ever he will like taunt people at restaurants where like
[2239.58 → 2244.70] you know there's like Indian heat you order something it's like is this spicy as a white people
[2244.70 → 2249.34] spicy yeah, yeah like if you're like very hot they'll be like all right I'll give you a medium
[2249.34 → 2255.02] he'll like taunt them yeah so that they'll like intentionally spike it even harder, and he just loves it
[2255.02 → 2259.66] but then if they come out, and he's sweating, and he's like dabbing, and he's like huh then they win
[2260.86 → 2267.90] but he also wins like he wants that my dad's crazy he is also like my dad's a freak he'll also just pop
[2267.90 → 2273.66] jalapeños and not react at all because he's just a machine but anyway his mouth is just dead it's just
[2274.46 → 2275.42] it's just like a callus
[2277.42 → 2282.06] I've lost a hot sauce callus he has calluses for everything else I've lost all sensitivity in my mouth
[2282.06 → 2288.78] it makes me cool that's like why everything that's an acquired taste in life yeah so it's bad
[2289.82 → 2296.46] coffee cigars olives whiskey olives is an acquired taste it was for me okay a lot of people don't like
[2296.46 → 2300.70] olives I like them now and I get them and nobody eats them like at parties and stuff i we're getting
[2300.70 → 2307.10] off here I'm going to switch off this for a second I love olives and to like a point where it's a
[2307.10 → 2313.02] a character fault almost when I was a kid my mom used to buy canned olives and like the neighbours
[2313.02 → 2317.34] and my brother and I would like the neighbour's kids and my brother and I would all sit down and
[2317.34 → 2321.82] like play a board game or something and I'd just grab a can of olives and just eat the entire thing
[2321.82 → 2328.54] and then when I was done I would drink oh, and it drove people insane but I didn't do it for that
[2328.54 → 2332.62] reason i actually just really liked it but anyway wait I have an olive story okay I had a party once
[2332.62 → 2338.38] and we're all eating olives and uh and then this one friend of mine was like we're just commenting
[2338.38 → 2342.22] on olives and blah blah blah, and it was at the stage where I was just getting into them wasn't
[2342.22 → 2346.54] sure if I liked them or not yet and my friend was like this sounds so hardcore he was like uh yeah
[2348.38 → 2354.22] I had a flight of olives, and he was like I think eating olives is like kind of erotic and then
[2354.22 → 2360.70] everyone was like I was like okay I never got to that everyone kind of just went silent it was like
[2361.90 → 2369.10] okay moving on like I'm not holding it against them like no I mean maybe it is whatever i just
[2369.10 → 2372.94] hadn't had that thought, and it was just it's a very non-offensive thing to be into in that way but
[2372.94 → 2382.06] like Geez anyway moving on fresh bush I mean if you want to like to sell olives or anything else like

[2453.10 → 2458.06] the ingredient or the sponsor okay the only time I ever use honey the ingredient is in like
[2458.06 → 2463.74] uh chamomile or ginger tea because I'm sick but anyway moving forward uh you've probably heard us talk
[2463.74 → 2468.30] about honey before because they've they've uh been a sponsor of the show before but if you have it, it's
[2468.30 → 2474.86] a free shopping tool that finds the best promo codes whenever you shop online at specific sites
[2474.86 → 2480.46] so like when you go to a site, and you're in the checkout section when it finally shows the box to
[2480.46 → 2486.38] type in a promo code honey will be like hey I think I might have a few codes for this every time you read
[2486.38 → 2491.98] out this spot I'm like why don't I have this you should probably try if it's so stupid, and you just press
[2491.98 → 2496.30] the button, and it goes through an automated thing trying a bunch of codes, and sometimes it'll be like
[2496.86 → 2503.26] hey i none of them worked sorry, and sometimes you'll, you'll get a pretty sweet code i I've saved
[2503.26 → 2507.82] a very notable amount of money I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like I've saved a decent amount
[2507.82 → 2511.98] of money using honey that's sweet because like if you think about it if you've ever gone shopping for
[2511.98 → 2515.58] something, and you get to the checkout section, and you see a promo code box, and you spend like five
[2515.58 → 2519.82] minutes on Google going to a bunch of sketchy websites I've done that trying to get promo codes I've done
[2519.82 → 2526.46] that and then i I type them in and then they never all expires with honey it actually works
[2526.46 → 2531.02] quite often yeah you don't have to do any of the sketchy stuff it just handles all of it for you and
[2531.02 → 2535.50] you don't have to copy and paste a million codes it just chugs through them as fast as it can way better
[2535.50 → 2542.06] and it's going to know when the codes fail for you and update its central stuff and try to always have
[2542.06 → 2547.66] up-to-date codes as everyone attempts different surely the service costs tons of money though Luke it's free
[2547.66 → 2554.54] honey for those of you that uh try it out it's a free browser extension available on chrome Firefox

[2561.42 → 2568.38] eBay new egg racer best buy Walmart and more including skip the dishes I've had it work there quite a few
[2568.38 → 2574.54] times uh honey gets a small amount of commission from sites where honey saves you money uh there's also
[2574.54 → 2581.58] quite often honey specific discount codes oh yeah so that's how that will work nice, and they'll get
[2581.58 → 2586.78] like an affiliate style partnerships there good business so they make money off of the places
[2586.78 → 2591.50] that you buy stuff from not off of you which is cool get that honey money and I understand why they
[2591.50 → 2595.74] explain that because I think that helps with some of the skepticism because it sounds too good to be
[2595.74 → 2599.74] true, and then you're like oh okay they're just making money like travel agents a different source yeah
[2599.74 → 2604.78] yeah that's a pretty good comparison um it installs in just two clicks which is sweet
[2605.18 → 2610.86] uh it says Colton Brandon and a few others here at leg have used honey to save money shopping online
[2610.86 → 2621.26] um and yeah do what Colton does go to honey.com slash Linus, and you got it done here's a fun thing I did
[2621.26 → 2630.14] today yeah this one uh oh, so there's a new Facebook vulnerability that Facebook announced Facebook
[2630.14 → 2636.70] engineers have discovered a security issue affecting almost 50 million accounts hey attackers exploited
[2636.70 → 2641.82] a vulnerability in Facebook's code that impacted a feature called view as and that's one of those
[2641.82 → 2646.78] features where you look at your page as other people see it so like LinkedIn has that kind of thing
[2646.78 → 2654.54] it's actually a super cool feature um because it lets you see uh sorry I thought I saw someone
[2654.54 → 2659.18] in chat, but it's someone with like a parody name of them uh it lets you see your page as that person
[2659.18 → 2663.90] so if you're trying to hide things from people you can pick someone who fits within a category
[2663.90 → 2669.10] yeah of your privacy settings check it out make sure it's all hidden properly yeah, so there was a problem
[2669.10 → 2677.98] though because so what happened was it's like an interaction between multiple different features in
[2677.98 → 2685.58] the Facebook code so it stemmed from a change that Facebook made to their video uploading flow yeah which
[2685.58 → 2695.50] affected view as and that changed the video uploading flow was in July 2017 that's a pretty long time ago
[2695.50 → 2701.50] that sucks so Facebook issued this like uh this post that they had fixed the vulnerability and informed
[2701.50 → 2706.62] law enforcement including the FBI, and they said all these things that they like here's what we did
[2706.62 → 2711.26] because we care about your security so much they reset the access tokens of the 50 million counts
[2711.26 → 2717.42] affected the access tokens are like those uh they're like digital keys that allow you to not have to
[2717.42 → 2723.26] type in your name and password every time yeah enter your browser or navigate around and so this
[2723.26 → 2732.06] exploit like got the keys, so people could screw you and um so Facebook they reset the access tokens to
[2732.06 → 2735.82] like 50 million accounts that were affected, and then they took the precautionary step of resetting
[2735.82 → 2741.02] access tokens for yet another 40 million that they thought like um they could, they had been subject to a
[2741.02 → 2749.82] view as look up in the past year some overlap there but yeah um i so I have heard from a person
[2749.82 → 2753.90] uh I haven't talked to many people about this yet but in the small group of people that I have talked
[2753.90 → 2759.10] to I have heard from a person that they had to re-log into Facebook on all of their devices
[2759.10 → 2764.38] well here's the fun this is the last night or yes this is the fun thing I did today um because when you
[2765.90 → 2772.14] here's what I did I went to my phone and I went Facebook and I got this
[2772.14 → 2782.14] and Facebook Messenger as well session expired please log in again which means I either was
[2782.14 → 2788.94] compromised I'm either one of the 50 million or one of the 40 million yeah, and you don't know which one
[2788.94 → 2794.86] and then it says that once you log in again you will see on your news feed a notification at the top
[2794.86 → 2803.74] that explains what happened damn it yeah I didn't get logged out on anything dang it Instagram as well
[2806.38 → 2811.02] Facebook has yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or whether any information
[2811.02 → 2815.66] was accessed they don't know who's behind the attacks they don't know from which geographic region
[2815.66 → 2822.14] the attackers hail I mean you can probably guarantee that in some way it was misused like
[2822.14 → 2827.50] they're going to try to harvest some form of information I don't know what it's going to be
[2827.50 → 2834.78] what if they just made funny posts like they just made Luke status lol I hacked this guy's account
[2834.78 → 2839.02] that's Luke status don't you hate when your finger punches through the toilet paper
[2841.82 → 2847.66] everyone ew Luke TMI why would you post that I did it and I have that like extension on my computer so
[2847.66 → 2853.26] I can't see my news feed have you heard about that oh no but I like the idea no it's great and it puts
[2853.26 → 2858.06] like an inspirational quote where the news feed is or where the I don't know what it's even called
[2858.06 → 2863.58] the feed in general not necessarily news because it's your friends post and stuff but yeah i only
[2863.58 → 2869.10] exclusively use Facebook for chats and groups yeah that's awesome um so I just banned the feed so i
[2869.10 → 2873.90] wouldn't even know if you have that on mobile no but I just don't go to the Facebook app on mobile i
[2873.90 → 2878.30] just only use messenger yeah that'd be awesome they should get it for Instagram but then that
[2878.30 → 2887.18] would get rid of the entire app god why Instagram I guess you could see like stories and pms
[2887.74 → 2890.54] instead of the inspirational quote they should give you a nihilist meme
[2892.62 → 2898.46] just a direct feed from the nihilist Rb's twitter yeah just the inevitable end of the universe is to heat
[2898.46 → 2903.34] death yeah this is nothing matters anything nothing that you do matters because it will be deleted by the
[2903.34 → 2912.78] sun um anyway so that's that's scary if you got logged out of all your stuff um just a heads-up
[2912.78 → 2917.42] so you may have access to your account may have been pwned like me yeah oh Facebook by the way says
[2917.42 → 2923.58] you don't need to update your password uh because it was access token based not password based so you
[2923.58 → 2928.22] don't really have to do anything they didn't forge the key to the lock they just walked around the door
[2928.22 → 2935.02] that's how I described that security style cool because some people talk about like oh like I have
[2935.02 → 2940.94] a password that's 100 characters this account is invulnerable to everything no because if they find a
[2940.94 → 2949.66] way to just not have to use the password or if you give it to them or yeah or that yeah did you follow
[2949.66 → 2956.22] the uh the Disney fox Comcast thing like pretty much not at all we've talked about it a little bit
[2956.86 → 2963.34] um let me give you a 10 seconder sure okay because like it's its been evolving over the summer
[2963.34 → 2969.18] there's these huge players that are all trying to uh acquire each other because there's a
[2969.18 → 2975.98] giant race for streaming platform and where you're going to watch your TV next so let me give you the TLDR hold on
[2975.98 → 2984.94] Zeke d did a super chat sorry I'm new to this stuff I don't know the YouTube streaming stuff
[2984.94 → 2990.62] he said you guys are awesome oh that's us that's us yeah, yeah high five dude thanks man yeah nice
[2990.62 → 2997.18] also rip headphone users float plane for the win I appreciate it man thank you very much I appreciate
[2997.18 → 3003.42] you yeah by the way Zeke float plane has a new payment system which is cool and there's now no bitcoin
[3003.42 → 3009.10] though no, no bitcoin no bitcoin and there's now discord integrations from floatplane.com
[3009.74 → 3016.86] to discord what does that mean uh you can have your account sync up, so this is it's a general
[3016.86 → 3022.94] thing any of the creators can do it I haven't told tech deals or nitwit yet because we're still testing
[3022.94 → 3026.46] things a little bit and making sure it's a little bit more cleaned up, but theoretically they could turn
[3026.46 → 3031.90] it on anytime um, but there 's's still some work to do before it's perfect um, and it makes it so
[3031.90 → 3037.74] that if you join that creator's discord you get a special role saying you're like a subscriber to
[3037.74 → 3041.74] float plane oh yeah, and you can get granted access to a chat I don't know how the creators want to
[3041.74 → 3046.78] decide oh they get to implement the perks as they want yeah so much freedom the land of the free is
[3046.78 → 3052.86] float plane yeah seriously it also has a notification feature so it can like post links to new videos as
[3052.86 → 3057.02] they come up into the discord and whatnot that's cool yeah because you're just hanging on discord anyway
[3057.02 → 3062.62] yeah anyway here's the timeline from the whole like thanks auction drama there's a ton of auctions to
[3062.62 → 3069.42] buy stuff it's actually kind of interesting okay fox was for sale like 20th Century Fox oh wait is that
[3069.42 → 3073.82] different from fox I think that's a subset of fox I'm going to cut you off for one quick second we got
[3073.82 → 3082.78] another crazy super chat no idea what this is worth, but it's 1024 sec is that uh that's not Singapore
[3082.78 → 3089.90] is it what is sec currency he said olive review channel on float plane heck yeah dude oh it's Swedish
[3089.90 → 3102.94] króna nice how much was it uh 1024 from that's 150 bucks of rules Canadian holy Geez yeah buddy thank
[3102.94 → 3109.74] you thank you flow plane okay sorry let's let's get back to the fox was for sale Disney wanted to buy it
[3109.74 → 3114.70] Disney's making a streaming service and plus they also own a large part of Hulu so buying fox gets
[3114.70 → 3119.50] you a lot of sweet shows over the years like family guy and all sorts of stuff yeah um that they could
[3119.50 → 3124.70] put on the streaming services so fox wanted to firefly so there you go Disney wanted to buy fox
[3125.58 → 3131.42] Comcast was competing with them to buy fox, and they had like a bidding war and in the end Disney won
[3131.42 → 3140.30] and they acquired fox but um meanwhile fox owned 39 of this European network called sky
[3141.66 → 3145.58] and obviously both of these companies Comcast and Disney want to be in Europe because they want to
[3145.58 → 3153.74] expand globally so while fox was for sale and being bid on by Disney and Comcast fox itself which is owned
[3153.74 → 3159.42] by Rupert Murdoch was trying to get 100 stakes in sky or at least a majority stake in sky or wait
[3159.42 → 3167.66] Comcast was no, no fox owned sky or owned 39 of sky on 39 of sky and yeah and fox was trying to
[3167.66 → 3173.74] own it wholly so that when it was when fox was bought whoever bought it would also get all sky
[3174.62 → 3179.82] so in the end between Disney and Comcast Disney won they spent more than they wanted to and they
[3179.82 → 3186.70] they got fox, but they didn't end up getting sky because when Comcast did not win the bid to get
[3186.70 → 3194.70] what go when Comcast did not win the bid to get fox they started bidding on sky and they actually
[3194.70 → 3200.86] outbid fox on bidding on sky does this make sense okay yeah
[3201.74 → 3213.42] ah uh so now so then Comcast owns part of sky and Disney because they bought fox they own part of sky
[3213.42 → 3219.18] and in the end um fox was just or wait no Disney didn't get if it wasn't it ended up not being
[3219.18 → 3224.70] part of the deal and then fox was like screw it Comcast you can have all the sky so now the at the end
[3225.26 → 3234.46] Disney owned fox Comcast owned sky there's no more partial ownership okay there you have it that
[3235.10 → 3241.66] was a mess not your explanation just everything that happened there was crazy it's an it's pretty
[3241.66 → 3247.42] amount of back and forth pretty interesting little dance there I'm surprised they I'm surprised Disney
[3247.42 → 3251.58] gave up on that because they've been just chomping things lately I'm surprised they were just like no
[3252.30 → 3259.58] we're taking that 39 I don't I don't know how that works I don't because the Disney deal I thought was
[3259.58 → 3265.18] just going through so much earlier that I don't know if this had an effect like that they ended up
[3265.18 → 3269.02] changing the price that they pay for fox because they thought that sky was going to be part of the fox deal
[3269.02 → 3279.50] crazy hold on what's the sale price here okay hold on you guys need to recheck the caption on the Amazon
[3279.50 → 3286.62] Gizmodo article you got the tips picture wrong people are flipping out oh really let's look into this
[3286.62 → 3297.10] the tips for the tips' oh don't want to report the wrong thing no um bob swan that's one
[3297.66 → 3304.94] okay we're navigating back now we are you got to go to the original source though yeah Gizmodo
[3306.46 → 3314.38] what is it he says the caption that's right under it tips are the tactics Amazon advises management
[3314.38 → 3325.74] oh not to use pretty big important difference oof so oof okay, okay well now I'm just going to shift blame
[3326.94 → 3327.82] to Gizmodo
[3330.14 → 3338.86] well okay because that uh screenshot is really incriminating and defamatory, but they don't
[3338.86 → 3344.78] actually I don't believe they address it in their article except for this little caption so I think
[3344.78 → 3346.78] that's a little misleading
[3349.34 → 3353.66] but yeah let's own up we didn't read the caption yeah obviously they don't
[3354.86 → 3358.22] they don't want people interrogating and spying how's it going dude
[3358.22 → 3365.18] hey you guys call super chats uh it's hard, but sometimes we did two super chats hey no problem
[3365.18 → 3368.94] Colin's Colin's yelling at us are we supposed to love you guys dude you know how many Kronos we're
[3368.94 → 3375.02] getting how many we're rolling Kronos over a thousand yeah Swedish Kronos not bad look that up
[3376.06 → 3384.70] cool yeah I don't see any like main oh my god I didn't do anything I like the look what actually just
[3384.70 → 3390.86] are we still streaming did someone turn that oh god remotely through the app people please that
[3390.86 → 3401.02] the the squid uh dead so that means the camera's off oh my god the cat whoa anarchy
[3402.62 → 3407.18] are we streaming we are streaming, and the camera's on you can see you wouldn't be able to see
[3407.18 → 3414.06] that oh, oh I like uh interesting we got a little bit of light I like this low-key look thank you Zach f for
[3414.06 → 3420.30] the heads-up that we screwed up that part I don't personally I don't want to yeah I don't
[3420.30 → 3425.26] personally see them really talked about this tips thing and any of their mainline stuff but we absolutely
[3425.26 → 3429.90] should have read the caption regardless that makes a lot more sense that doesn't make a lot more
[3429.90 → 3435.58] sense don't threaten interrogate or promise or spy on your employees that makes sense because they were
[3435.58 → 3440.70] we did talk about how they were talking about things not to do got a phone call from the dentist here
[3440.70 → 3444.94] nice that's important just going to let that one ring out don't have a voicemail anymore that's a
[3444.94 → 3448.62] little update I don't know if I ever talked about that on Sancho but I talked to Linus about it
[3449.42 → 3454.06] because he was saying you know how you get these notifications for voicemail, and they just don't
[3454.06 → 3458.94] go away you can't clear them yes I hate that I absolutely hate it, and then you go to check your
[3458.94 → 3463.98] voicemail and if you're someone like me who doesn't pay MSP until like because it just comes off your
[3463.98 → 3469.74] tax return anyway, so there's no reason anyway I always have a full voicemail and then so Linus
[3469.74 → 3476.38] said that he had a colleague in the past I think at NCI who said his voicemail was literally hi this
[3476.38 → 3483.02] is the voicemail of blah blah do not leave a message here email me or send me a text do not leave a
[3483.02 → 3489.98] message here and I thought that sounds like an okay thing to do, but my voicemail is always full of scams
[3489.98 → 3495.82] and of MSP who's going to leave a message anyway so that wasn't going to work so I just got it completely
[3495.82 → 3503.58] removed my life is better all right there you go i uh I just do direct withdrawal on MSP yeah because
[3503.58 → 3510.46] I don't want to think about it yeah ever I did that before I think but whatever I like your style too
[3510.46 → 3516.62] though I think one of those two are probably the way to go evade yeah pay it or dodge it no you're still
[3516.62 → 3519.90] paying it eventually paid yeah yeah you're still paying it you have to anyway
[3519.90 → 3525.10] yeah so sorry about that inaccuracy thank you for checking us on that thank you very much and
[3525.10 → 3532.22] I'm happy that's I'm happy that's fixed now um is there more super chats to read probably are we like
[3532.22 → 3539.26] how much yeah I guess we've been going for almost our allotted time I don't know how to check the super
[3539.26 → 3546.38] chats though so can you talk to me about this uh PlayStation cross-platform playing fortnight's the
[3546.38 → 3551.26] first uh game you can play a cross-platform from your PlayStation yeah so here uh you talk about
[3551.26 → 3555.66] that I'm going to try to figure out super chats okay well I'll give the notes but I actually wanted to
[3555.66 → 3562.38] hear your like your take on it, i will comment on it cool so finally um Sony interactive
[3562.38 → 3567.50] entertainment says it has identified a path towards supporting cross-platform features for third-party
[3567.50 → 3573.34] content, so the first step is going to be an open beta which is on now for the game fortnight of course
[3573.34 → 3580.30] that will allow cross-platform gameplay progression and commerce across the PlayStation 4 android iOS
[3580.30 → 3587.26] Nintendo Switch Xbox One Microsoft Windows and Mac operating systems uh I think
[3589.34 → 3594.94] um I think this is weird like aren't you just going to get pwned by people with keyboard and mouse
[3594.94 → 3602.86] um I think to a certain to a certain degree I think people almost don't care but in this in a battle
[3602.86 → 3608.86] Royal where like if you're the third one left alive, and then you get wrecked, and you're you're just
[3608.86 → 3612.14] going to like ah you're gonna rage-quit, and you're gonna that guy definitely has a keyboard and mouse
[3614.06 → 3619.66] yeah I wonder if there's a way to queue cross-platform and a way to queue not cross-platform if that makes
[3619.66 → 3624.78] sense yeah i I wonder that as well but I can find any information on that because I would still like to be a
[3624.78 → 3630.30] ability to play with my buddy so like if my buddy has a PS4 and i for some reason wanted to play fortnight
[3630.30 → 3636.86] um I'd like to play with him, I think it would probably make sense if we had to queue for the pc queue
[3637.34 → 3644.22] yeah I think it would be segregated because you'd have to bring up the I don't know how to say this
[3645.10 → 3652.86] not as tactile experiences yeah like if is you wanted to you would have to buff them yeah well, well
[3652.86 → 3657.34] not you'd actually have to hurt them or nerf the other one yeah because you wouldn't, it would be
[3657.34 → 3663.66] it would be kind of brutal I think to bring a pc player into a console only environment yeah by
[3663.66 → 3668.22] inviting him to your group but if you're going to have to go the other way oh yeah it would have to bring
[3668.22 → 3674.94] up someone it's like it's your decision to queue with a pc player so you have to go play against pc
[3674.94 → 3680.30] people you know what I mean if you want to play mobile fortnight I don't know if this is a thing
[3680.30 → 3685.26] probably it is if you want to play well no but if you want to play mobile fortnight with a pc player
[3685.26 → 3691.18] yeah I think just going to get so wrecked and the thing that's interesting is that the game developers
[3691.18 → 3695.50] are pushing it for this for a long time sorry I have no idea what like the fortnight cross
[3695.50 → 3699.58] platform queuing stuff is I'm just saying that would make more sense to me game developers not
[3699.58 → 3704.06] just a fortnight but of other games have won a cross-platform for a long time because they just
[3704.06 → 3708.54] want more and more people to play their game but obviously the console makers like Microsoft and
[3708.54 → 3713.82] Sony they have the opposite incentive they want people to be silo siloed so I wonder if you're
[3713.82 → 3717.50] playing, and you're getting wrecked by someone with a keyboard and mouse, and you really care about the
[3717.50 → 3723.18] game you're thinking well i have to switch to pc because I want to kick ass with a keyboard and
[3723.18 → 3728.62] mouse do you think there's a fortnight will already cue keyboard and mouse apart from controller unless
[3728.62 → 3733.74] you're grouped with friends so they're doing this so you can be on your pc on a controller well yeah
[3733.74 → 3741.50] yeah, but the game recognizes that and that's how they oh that would make sense I think because
[3741.50 → 3747.58] there's no real advantage there yeah a little bit of frame rate or like hertz like refresh rate
[3748.14 → 3754.30] stuff but yeah okay that's cool but do you hear what I'm saying like if I'm playing and then someone
[3754.30 → 3758.54] wrecks me with a mouse and I'm like why am I playing on console I'm just going to move to pc and then I'm no
[3758.54 → 3763.10] longer a Sony places and customer I don't think that's really going to happen because
[3765.34 → 3768.70] if is they're already splitting the cues for controllers and keyboard and mouse unless you're
[3768.70 → 3774.78] in a group than the only reason why you're being brought to play with other people with keyboard
[3774.78 → 3779.50] and mouse is because you're playing with one of your friends yeah and the amount of people that are
[3779.50 → 3785.66] going to be in that niche group and then also care enough to buy a whole nother platform yeah it's
[3785.66 → 3790.22] going to be tiny you've also already got the sunk cost of you bought your places already
[3790.22 → 3795.50] so maybe on the next gen you don't buy the next gen you buy pc instead maybe and I think PlayStation
[3795.50 → 3801.58] is making so many people happy with this change, and it's honestly they might open the door for a
[3801.58 → 3807.26] lot more people to buy PlayStation because if is one is someone's like yeah I only play on freaking pc
[3807.26 → 3813.66] because my friends play on pc and I want to play a bunch of the perfect single player experiences
[3813.66 → 3820.30] on PlayStation like god of war uh horizon zero dawn spider-man all these perfect single-player
[3820.30 → 3823.74] experiences they could buy a PlayStation and still play with their friends it won't be an optimal
[3823.74 → 3829.42] experience, or you're playing on mobile, and you want to get more into it, but you can't afford a gaming pc
[3830.06 → 3834.86] get a console yeah still play with your mobile friends i I think it's a very good move for PlayStation
[3834.86 → 3839.10] I'm very happy with it, we don't know right now what the future holds for other games other than
[3839.10 → 3844.62] Fortnite getting this they haven't announced that at all, so people are also bringing up that you can
[3844.62 → 3853.02] keyboard and mouse on PlayStation it's not the same but yeah um to go through some super chats uh
