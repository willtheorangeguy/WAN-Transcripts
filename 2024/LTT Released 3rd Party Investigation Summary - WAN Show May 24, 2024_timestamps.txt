10-yr Enterprise Developer here! If they cite the correct total # of replies in the creator app but only display a subset, it sounds like there’s a UI filter enabled (intentionally or otherwise) in one UI and not in the other. The ‘filter’ may be simply a data mapping bug or something similar as well. Finally, it could possibly be caused by timestamps in cloud-server-land not being interpreted correctly by one service compared to another, and resulting in the exclusion of records when that (or something similar) happens, potentially forever (until either the services or the data is updated)
