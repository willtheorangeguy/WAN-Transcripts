[4:02:17] *Outro.*

*Side note:* While I understand the preference of having chapters for a 3H+ podcasts as soon as possible, I should've never started doing them on time as I've set unrealistic expectations for myself and others who would be interested in creating timecodes - it's mentally taxing to do them at 4-10 AM, and I've done at least 128 by now with a past attempt to retire haha.
Starting today, I'll be adopting WAN Show's *Soonâ„¢* strategy, which means I'll create & post them whenever I'm ready. Some WAN Shows might have instant ones, others might be delayed by up to two days, no promises.
Thank you for your patience today, donations link on my channel's about page if you're interested.
