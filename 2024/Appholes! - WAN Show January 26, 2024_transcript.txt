[0.00 --> 5.18]  Welcome to the WEN show. We've got a great show for you guys today and
[5.18 --> 11.36]  Look Luke. I know we have this thing where I pick two topics for the show
[11.36 --> 15.58]  And then you pick two topics for the show and you're always all like man
[15.58 --> 19.42]  Those two topics were the ones that I wanted to do. So
[19.42 --> 24.20]  I think I have the solution. Okay, I'll just do all the topics
[24.20 --> 26.20]  We're gonna be talking about the framework 16
[26.20 --> 32.96]  Apple complying with the EU but like only sort of not really the HP CEO saying the quiet part out loud
[32.96 --> 34.96]  We're gonna be talking about
[34.96 --> 35.96]  uh
[35.96 --> 36.96]  uh
[36.96 --> 37.46]  uh
[37.46 --> 39.04]  Now you're the one searching
[39.04 --> 41.96]  Crap this is hard. Yeah. There's like two good ones
[41.96 --> 42.96]  Yeah
[42.96 --> 47.96]  Okay, pick one more. Go.
[47.96 --> 52.08]  I was gonna do teenager criminally charged for snapchat joke. Yeah, really?
[52.08 --> 55.98]  Wow. Well wasn't a good joke though. That's true. Okay
[55.98 --> 78.74]  The show today is brought to you by AG1 Squarespace and Avessi
[78.74 --> 83.50]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course
[83.50 --> 93.34]  Apple's compliance with the EU's regulations that are forcing them to behave less like a walled garden and more like a
[94.50 --> 97.66]  Fault garden with barbed wire around it dummy
[97.66 --> 99.50]  um
[99.50 --> 101.50]  Yeah, so
[101.50 --> 102.74]  Okay
[102.74 --> 110.70]  Apple is being accused of malicious compliance with the European Union's digital markets act or DMA
[110.70 --> 115.30]  After detailing its plans to add support for third-party app stores
[115.30 --> 122.98]  Third-party payment systems and browser engines other than Safari to iOS in the European Union
[122.98 --> 124.82]  In a news release
[124.82 --> 130.94]  Apple repeatedly emphasized that the DMA opens new avenues for malware fraud and scams
[130.94 --> 136.26]  And illicit and harmful content and other privacy and security threats now
[136.26 --> 136.74]  Sure does
[136.74 --> 138.34]  Here's what I'd like to know
[138.34 --> 138.74]  Yeah
[138.74 --> 143.02]  Apple's a very privacy and security first company aren't they?
[143.02 --> 143.48]  Yes
[143.48 --> 147.10]  So then with all the resources that they have with the
[147.10 --> 152.32]  Are they at hundreds of billions of dollars of cash reserves right now?
[152.44 --> 152.82]  Probably
[152.82 --> 158.10]  Yeah, and with all the with all the people in the tech industry that are in need of work right now
[158.10 --> 161.90]  I would like to know Apple what investments you're making
[161.90 --> 165.86]  To ensure that as an iPhone user in the European Union
[165.86 --> 167.78]  I'm not going to be affected by this stuff
[167.78 --> 171.14]  No seriously though
[171.14 --> 172.98]  Apple's one of those companies that
[172.98 --> 175.24]  This is very unlike them
[175.24 --> 178.54]  To acknowledge any potential flaw in their product
[178.54 --> 182.94]  Even if it is caused by compliance with a third-party regulation
[182.94 --> 184.86]  They don't like to talk about that
[184.86 --> 185.28]  Yeah
[185.28 --> 190.96]  They like to talk about safety and security and privacy and the Apple experience
[190.96 --> 197.76]  You can tell they're at they're at the desperation stage to try to do something about this
[197.76 --> 200.32]  However, Apple
[200.32 --> 204.82]  Has a solution
[204.82 --> 209.32]  Apple has instituted multiple safeguards
[209.32 --> 214.88]  Including requiring Apple authorization of all developers
[214.88 --> 218.22]  On alternative of alternative app marketplaces
[218.22 --> 223.88]  A letter of credit of a million euros in order to launch an alternative app store
[223.88 --> 228.36]  Disclosure of alternative payments data
[228.36 --> 234.00]  Notarization of all apps that is app review by bots and humans
[234.00 --> 236.88]  So basically Apple is saying
[236.88 --> 237.34]  Okay
[237.34 --> 239.40]  You can have your own store
[239.40 --> 244.32]  But the only way that we could possibly ensure the security of the iPhone
[244.32 --> 245.56]  Is if
[245.56 --> 248.34]  We're basically like in charge of it
[248.34 --> 251.38]  And also you pay us a bunch of money
[251.38 --> 252.12]  A lot
[252.12 --> 255.34]  Apple will be reducing their current fees
[255.34 --> 257.50]  A 10% fee for subscriptions
[257.50 --> 260.58]  A 17% fee for digital goods and services
[260.58 --> 264.30]  And an additional 3% for using Apple's payment system
[264.30 --> 270.98]  However, Apple will also be adding a new core technology fee
[270.98 --> 273.32]  So once an app hits 1 million installs
[273.98 --> 276.92]  Its devs will have to pay 50 euro cents
[276.92 --> 278.22]  Is that what they're actually called?
[278.42 --> 279.24]  Euro cents?
[279.48 --> 280.02]  Yeah, I don't know
[280.02 --> 280.44]  50
[280.44 --> 281.54]  Half of a euro
[281.54 --> 285.20]  For every new user who installs it on iOS
[285.20 --> 286.32]  Annually
[286.88 --> 289.32]  That is wild
[290.06 --> 290.84]  Okay, anyway
[290.84 --> 294.76]  The app can be reinstalled by the same user for no charge for 12 months though
[294.76 --> 297.14]  Wow, it's actually euro cents
[297.14 --> 300.84]  This applies to paid apps and free apps
[300.84 --> 306.60]  Apple says they will have an install verification mechanism to avoid install spam
[306.60 --> 309.84]  Because I'm sure it'll be like totally in their interest to ensure that
[309.84 --> 313.30]  You know, the experience on third-party app stores is really good
[313.30 --> 315.50]  They've really telegraphed that
[315.50 --> 318.06]  Apple has provided a fee calculator
[318.06 --> 321.44]  And some devs have found that under some circumstances
[321.44 --> 324.94]  Apple could take as much as 60% of their yearly revenue
[324.94 --> 325.40]  Nice
[325.40 --> 330.90]  Developers of alternative app stores need to pay the CTF for every first annual installation
[330.90 --> 333.56]  Including the first million
[333.56 --> 338.08]  Oh man
[338.08 --> 338.80]  But don't worry
[338.80 --> 339.90]  Don't worry
[339.90 --> 340.90]  There's an alternative
[340.90 --> 344.68]  If developers don't like this deal
[344.68 --> 345.62]  Right, good
[345.62 --> 348.26]  Well, they can stay under Apple's current business terms
[348.26 --> 350.44]  And remain exclusively on the app store
[350.44 --> 355.12]  Where no third-party marketplaces or payment systems will be allowed
[355.12 --> 363.96]  So is the only way to get an alternative store onto the platform by distributing the alternative store through the app store?
[364.28 --> 366.20]  I actually do not know
[366.20 --> 367.80]  That is a really good question
[367.80 --> 369.86]  Because that's what it sounds like through their terms
[369.86 --> 376.74]  Because how could they charge you if you didn't get it through the app store?
[376.74 --> 378.96]  Luke
[378.96 --> 379.98]  How does that make any sense?
[380.24 --> 381.18]  Luke, I'm not sure
[381.18 --> 382.84]  I'm sure that
[382.84 --> 385.98]  When it comes to collecting your money
[385.98 --> 389.20]  I think Apple will find a way
[389.20 --> 394.74]  It's unclear how Apple will authorize and distribute the alternative marketplaces
[394.74 --> 395.14]  Yeah
[395.14 --> 402.58]  Maybe their hope is that this deal will be technically compliant with the EU's guidelines
[402.58 --> 403.70]  Not guidelines, laws
[403.70 --> 407.46]  But be so bad that nobody will actually do it
[407.46 --> 409.42]  Tim Sweeney's been going off
[409.42 --> 410.04]  Has he?
[410.16 --> 410.64]  Oh yeah
[410.64 --> 412.34]  Yeah, oh man
[412.34 --> 413.84]  He's been going off
[413.84 --> 414.60]  And to be clear
[414.60 --> 417.72]  I do not agree with Tim Sweeney about everything
[417.72 --> 421.96]  In fact, we've like had personal beef at one point
[421.96 --> 423.30]  It was a while ago, but yeah
[423.30 --> 424.96]  But what he is right about
[424.96 --> 428.20]  Just because I don't agree with someone once
[428.20 --> 431.88]  Doesn't mean I can't agree with them when they say something correct
[431.88 --> 434.78]  Like, I'm not saying Hitler was right
[434.78 --> 435.46]  No, okay
[435.46 --> 439.72]  I was going to say something specific
[439.72 --> 442.70]  I don't know, maybe he said something about how trains should be on time or something
[442.70 --> 443.20]  I don't know
[443.20 --> 444.08]  I don't actually
[444.08 --> 446.64]  I haven't memorized any quotes
[446.64 --> 447.42]  Okay
[447.42 --> 449.46]  My point is just that
[449.46 --> 451.48]  Just because I disagree with someone about something
[451.48 --> 453.62]  Doesn't mean I can't acknowledge when they're right about something
[453.62 --> 454.76]  Maybe the chair was comfy
[454.76 --> 455.92]  And Mr. Sweeney
[455.92 --> 457.62]  The chair?
[457.82 --> 458.80]  Some people will get that
[458.80 --> 459.20]  It's fine
[459.20 --> 459.68]  Oh, okay
[459.68 --> 463.12]  Mr. Sweeney is definitely
[463.12 --> 466.08]  Luke, please control this man
[466.08 --> 469.72]  Yeah, Luke
[469.72 --> 471.46]  Some people got it, good
[471.46 --> 472.54]  Look what you've done
[472.54 --> 473.48]  What?
[473.80 --> 473.96]  What?
[475.56 --> 476.04]  How?
[476.04 --> 480.02]  So, so Mr. Sweeney is 100% correct here
[480.02 --> 485.88]  When he says that Apple is absolutely behaving in an anti-competitive way
[485.88 --> 490.86]  The EU has called them out on it in a very clear way
[490.86 --> 498.24]  And Apple has gone out of their way to ensure that the manner in which they've complied with the EU's new regulations
[498.24 --> 502.34]  Is as awful as humanly possible
[502.34 --> 505.62]  Also, we had talked before about
[505.62 --> 509.84]  Okay, if Apple is forced to allow additional marketplaces and all of that
[509.84 --> 511.98]  Well, how is it going to affect people outside the EU?
[512.10 --> 513.32]  It looks like the answer is
[513.32 --> 514.58]  Not one bit
[514.58 --> 515.02]  It won't
[515.02 --> 520.40]  Apple will be maintaining its monopolistic behavior anywhere that it is allowed to
[520.40 --> 522.40]  So if you want anything to change
[522.40 --> 525.40]  And change it can and should
[525.40 --> 529.00]  I mean Apple has demonstrated that they can have lower subscription fees
[529.00 --> 532.00]  As long as they can charge you a
[532.00 --> 533.00]  What is it?
[533.00 --> 535.40]  A core technology fee
[535.40 --> 536.54]  Man, this is bizarre
[536.54 --> 537.16]  Like why?
[537.52 --> 541.14]  Why do people defend this kind of double dipping behavior?
[541.64 --> 541.96]  I don't know
[541.96 --> 542.76]  You see a lot of it though
[542.76 --> 544.78]  It's triple dipping actually
[544.78 --> 548.12]  First they charge the user for the device
[548.12 --> 552.28]  Then they charge the developer just to have a developer account
[552.28 --> 553.88]  Oh no, we're up to quadruple dipping now
[553.88 --> 556.50]  Then they charge the developer to have a developer account
[556.50 --> 559.46]  Then they charge you a core technology fee
[559.46 --> 561.68]  If you actually have a very successful app
[561.68 --> 565.12]  Then they charge you a 10% fee on subscriptions
[565.12 --> 567.22]  17% for digital goods and services
[567.22 --> 570.14]  At what point does it end?
[570.90 --> 572.58]  Well, you also have to use their payment system
[572.58 --> 576.28]  Like we mock this kind of thing when it's the cable company
[576.28 --> 578.06]  But realistically
[578.06 --> 582.20]  Most people have as many options for cable companies
[582.20 --> 585.12]  As they do for major cell phone platforms
[585.12 --> 587.50]  And so the people who say
[587.50 --> 589.16]  Well, Apple's not a monopoly
[589.16 --> 590.50]  Because Android exists
[590.50 --> 590.88]  It's like
[590.88 --> 594.70]  Okay, okay, okay, okay
[594.70 --> 596.62]  Right, but that doesn't
[596.62 --> 598.06]  You can have a duopoly then
[598.06 --> 601.32]  It doesn't change that you can have monopolistic behavior
[601.32 --> 602.72]  People compare it to Steam
[602.72 --> 606.64]  And I'm not here to defend Steam's 30% take either
[606.64 --> 607.98]  No, not even a little
[607.98 --> 610.20]  But on a computer
[610.20 --> 612.40]  You could use things that aren't Steam
[612.40 --> 613.56]  Well, yeah
[613.56 --> 615.92]  That in Steam actually has
[615.92 --> 617.40]  As far as I can tell
[617.40 --> 619.34]  Steam doesn't charge Epic Games money
[619.34 --> 620.82]  To sell games on their platform
[620.82 --> 622.86]  No, and as far as I can tell
[622.86 --> 625.02]  Steam doesn't charge game devs
[625.02 --> 626.38]  Any ongoing fees
[626.38 --> 628.30]  For the original purchase of the game
[628.30 --> 629.88]  So you could have a game
[629.88 --> 631.82]  That's 160 gigabytes
[631.82 --> 634.44]  You could download that game
[634.44 --> 636.54]  Now and forever
[636.54 --> 639.00]  Not to mention all the cloud synchronization
[639.00 --> 639.92]  Of your save files
[639.92 --> 641.68]  Remember, Nintendo's gonna charge you
[641.68 --> 642.88]  Like, what, eight bucks a month
[642.88 --> 643.98]  Per user
[643.98 --> 645.58]  To sync your cloud save
[645.58 --> 646.94]  To sync your saves to the cloud
[646.94 --> 649.80]  Like, Steam is actually operating a platform
[649.80 --> 652.58]  That actually delivers value to the user
[652.58 --> 654.90]  I want to buy games on Steam
[654.90 --> 656.04]  Whereas
[656.04 --> 658.12]  What is Apple actually doing?
[658.22 --> 658.78]  I mean, yeah
[658.78 --> 659.78]  They handle downloading
[659.78 --> 660.40]  Sure
[660.40 --> 662.14]  But the infrastructure
[662.14 --> 664.26]  By comparison
[664.26 --> 665.78]  When we're talking downloads
[665.78 --> 666.44]  That are
[666.44 --> 668.68]  160 gigabytes
[668.68 --> 670.58]  In many cases
[670.58 --> 671.44]  And we're talking
[671.44 --> 672.04]  It's often megs
[672.04 --> 673.00]  Downloads that are
[673.00 --> 674.92]  160 megabytes
[674.92 --> 676.60]  And that's a pretty decent sized app
[676.60 --> 677.30]  I mean, you'll get
[677.30 --> 678.44]  Multi-gigabit
[678.44 --> 679.18]  Or gigabit
[679.18 --> 680.44]  You'll get multi-gigabyte
[680.44 --> 681.58]  Mobile apps
[681.58 --> 683.52]  Especially for games
[683.52 --> 683.78]  But
[683.78 --> 684.74]  There'll be
[684.74 --> 685.92]  Three or four
[685.92 --> 687.26]  Typically
[687.26 --> 688.44]  Not hundreds
[688.44 --> 689.24]  And
[689.24 --> 690.00]  To be clear
[690.00 --> 691.30]  I just want to make this clear
[691.30 --> 692.02]  Apple's operating
[692.02 --> 693.18]  At an enormous scale
[693.18 --> 694.16]  On the App Store
[694.16 --> 696.02]  But don't kid yourself
[696.02 --> 697.22]  So is Valve
[697.22 --> 699.04]  Gaming
[699.04 --> 700.26]  It's kind of a thing
[700.26 --> 700.72]  Yeah
[700.72 --> 701.92]  Yeah, and like
[701.92 --> 703.38]  People are bringing up
[703.38 --> 704.86]  Like, oh, you can buy an Android
[704.86 --> 705.46]  And it's like
[705.46 --> 706.86]  Okay, so there's the whole
[706.86 --> 707.86]  Duopoly thing
[707.86 --> 709.56]  Also, we're talking about
[709.56 --> 710.98]  Platforms in general
[710.98 --> 712.48]  We don't think Android is
[712.48 --> 714.32]  Necessarily better off here
[714.32 --> 715.06]  The
[715.06 --> 717.28]  Play Store is also terrible
[717.28 --> 719.00]  Just you can
[719.00 --> 719.64]  Technically
[719.64 --> 721.78]  It's not a very clean process
[721.78 --> 723.62]  But you can sideload on Android
[723.62 --> 726.44]  And the Steam example
[726.44 --> 727.70]  This would be like
[727.70 --> 728.14]  If
[728.14 --> 729.30]  The only way
[729.30 --> 730.06]  That you could get
[730.06 --> 731.46]  Any apps on Windows
[731.46 --> 733.66]  Was the Microsoft Store
[733.66 --> 735.42]  I know I just gave everyone
[735.42 --> 735.92]  Nightmares
[735.92 --> 737.08]  I apologize for that
[737.08 --> 738.60]  But it would be
[738.60 --> 740.10]  As if that was the only way
[740.10 --> 741.18]  And for Steam
[741.18 --> 742.50]  Or something else to exist
[742.50 --> 743.34]  Microsoft is going to
[743.34 --> 744.20]  Take a cut of it
[744.20 --> 744.68]  Yep
[744.68 --> 747.62]  Just for Valve
[747.62 --> 748.42]  Having the privilege
[748.42 --> 749.32]  To be allowed
[749.32 --> 750.26]  To have Steam
[750.26 --> 750.72]  Yeah
[750.72 --> 752.44]  That's pretty
[752.44 --> 753.04]  Crap
[753.04 --> 754.20]  Is that a thing
[754.20 --> 754.84]  That you would like?
[754.98 --> 755.40]  Is that a thing
[755.40 --> 756.10]  That you would defend?
[756.10 --> 757.62]  Do you think that would have made
[757.62 --> 760.44]  Would that have made the PC
[760.44 --> 761.32]  What it is today?
[761.66 --> 762.24]  Someone said
[762.24 --> 763.38]  You mean like on Windows RT
[763.38 --> 764.96]  I know practically nothing
[764.96 --> 765.76]  About Windows RT
[765.76 --> 767.30]  But if that's how it would work
[767.30 --> 767.98]  That's not something
[767.98 --> 768.48]  I would defend
[768.48 --> 769.52]  Uh
[769.52 --> 770.32]  Does Windows RT
[770.32 --> 771.62]  Even exist anymore?
[772.08 --> 772.74]  I don't know
[772.74 --> 774.22]  Windows RT
[774.22 --> 775.16]  Is
[775.16 --> 777.18]  A mobile operating system
[777.18 --> 778.54]  Designed by
[778.54 --> 779.76]  First unveiled
[779.76 --> 781.88]  January 2011
[781.88 --> 782.70]  Oh
[782.70 --> 783.88]  Final release
[783.88 --> 785.52]  January 10th
[785.52 --> 786.18]  2023
[786.18 --> 787.90]  12 months ago
[787.90 --> 789.36]  So is it
[789.36 --> 790.80]  Is it still a thing?
[790.86 --> 791.82]  Is it not a thing?
[792.10 --> 793.00]  I suspect it's
[793.00 --> 793.82]  Supported
[793.82 --> 794.74]  Extended support
[794.74 --> 795.54]  Was ended
[795.54 --> 796.58]  January 10th
[796.58 --> 797.14]  2023
[797.14 --> 797.94]  Never mind
[797.94 --> 798.46]  So
[798.46 --> 799.38]  Yeah
[799.38 --> 801.80]  That's how good it is
[801.80 --> 802.42]  Sick
[802.42 --> 803.46]  Cool
[803.46 --> 804.18]  Nice
[804.18 --> 808.00]  Yeah
[808.00 --> 809.00]  Windows for ARM
[809.00 --> 810.34]  Would be the replacement
[810.34 --> 811.62]  For Windows RT
[811.62 --> 812.60]  Uh
[812.60 --> 813.68]  And my understanding is
[813.68 --> 815.02]  Nothing on Windows for ARM
[815.02 --> 816.22]  Would prevent you from just
[816.22 --> 817.86]  Downloading
[817.86 --> 819.90]  An application
[819.90 --> 820.96]  And installing it
[820.96 --> 822.14]  In fact I was uh
[822.14 --> 822.98]  Man what was that
[822.98 --> 823.98]  I was installing something
[823.98 --> 824.58]  The other day
[824.58 --> 825.82]  I was saying S mode
[825.82 --> 827.18]  But you can turn S mode off
[827.18 --> 827.70]  Can you not?
[828.12 --> 828.36]  Yeah
[828.36 --> 829.26]  Yeah so like
[829.26 --> 830.24]  What are you talking about?
[830.46 --> 830.68]  Yeah
[830.68 --> 831.52]  If I can
[831.52 --> 832.58]  If I can voluntarily
[832.58 --> 833.58]  Make my phone
[833.58 --> 834.50]  Only allow apps
[834.50 --> 835.12]  To be installed
[835.12 --> 835.98]  From the app store
[835.98 --> 837.06]  That's fine
[837.06 --> 838.12]  Like this is
[838.12 --> 838.82]  I don't know man
[838.82 --> 839.72]  This is like the
[839.72 --> 840.00]  The
[840.00 --> 841.08]  I don't understand these arguments
[841.08 --> 841.52]  This is
[841.52 --> 841.86]  Well
[841.86 --> 842.40]  Okay
[842.40 --> 843.10]  A lot of the
[843.10 --> 844.30]  A lot of the Apple argument
[844.30 --> 845.36]  Boils down to
[845.36 --> 846.26]  Well
[846.26 --> 846.68]  You
[846.68 --> 848.36]  You do have a choice
[848.36 --> 848.70]  I
[848.70 --> 849.40]  I like
[849.40 --> 850.10]  The lockdown
[850.10 --> 851.22]  Experience
[851.22 --> 851.68]  Sure
[851.68 --> 852.48]  And it's like
[852.48 --> 853.38]  Right
[853.38 --> 854.38]  So then
[854.38 --> 856.58]  Sit down
[856.58 --> 857.06]  And shut the
[857.06 --> 857.56]  Fuck up
[857.56 --> 858.16]  Yeah
[858.16 --> 859.24]  I don't
[859.24 --> 859.50]  Yeah
[859.50 --> 861.28]  And I should be allowed
[861.28 --> 862.12]  To install
[862.12 --> 863.04]  Whatever software
[863.04 --> 863.64]  I feel like
[863.64 --> 864.24]  On this thing
[864.24 --> 864.40]  That
[864.40 --> 865.26]  I mean it's not
[865.26 --> 865.72]  It's not like
[865.72 --> 866.36]  Apple gives away
[866.36 --> 866.86]  The iPhone
[866.86 --> 868.68]  If Apple gave away
[868.68 --> 869.34]  The iPhone
[869.34 --> 870.16]  This would be
[870.16 --> 871.24]  A completely
[871.24 --> 872.40]  Different conversation
[872.40 --> 873.36]  Like okay
[873.36 --> 873.72]  For example
[873.72 --> 874.88]  Remember that TV Luke
[874.88 --> 876.82]  That TV that
[876.82 --> 877.82]  It watches you
[877.82 --> 878.12]  Or whatever
[878.12 --> 878.50]  Like watches you
[878.50 --> 879.40]  And plays ads
[879.40 --> 879.86]  Or whatever
[879.86 --> 881.86]  If that's the deal
[881.86 --> 882.58]  Okay
[882.58 --> 883.58]  The hardware's free
[883.58 --> 884.88]  You watch as much TV
[884.88 --> 885.46]  As you want
[885.46 --> 886.02]  And they're like
[886.02 --> 886.48]  Yeah
[886.48 --> 887.28]  We're gonna
[887.28 --> 888.28]  We're gonna bombard you
[888.28 --> 888.90]  With ads
[888.90 --> 889.62]  It's gonna be
[889.62 --> 890.24]  Pay to play
[890.24 --> 890.96]  For anyone
[890.96 --> 891.74]  Who wants to be
[891.74 --> 892.42]  Part of this
[892.42 --> 893.12]  Ecosystem
[893.12 --> 893.86]  And have their ads
[893.86 --> 894.52]  Displayed or whatever
[894.52 --> 894.74]  It's like
[894.74 --> 895.10]  Yeah sure
[895.10 --> 895.48]  Fine
[895.48 --> 897.74]  But my understanding
[897.74 --> 898.80]  When I pay
[898.80 --> 899.98]  Full pop
[899.98 --> 901.08]  And don't kid yourself
[901.08 --> 901.60]  Apple's not
[901.60 --> 903.00]  Discounting the iPhone
[903.00 --> 904.66]  They're not subsidizing
[904.66 --> 905.80]  The cost of the iPhone
[905.80 --> 906.52]  With the App Store
[906.52 --> 907.00]  They are just
[907.00 --> 908.50]  They are charging
[908.50 --> 909.22]  As much
[909.22 --> 910.28]  If not more
[910.28 --> 910.96]  They're taking
[910.96 --> 911.72]  More margin
[911.72 --> 912.22]  Than pretty much
[912.22 --> 912.48]  Any
[912.48 --> 913.06]  I think
[913.06 --> 913.54]  Any other
[913.54 --> 914.18]  Handset maker
[914.18 --> 915.08]  As far as I can tell
[915.08 --> 917.58]  So
[917.58 --> 918.72]  When I pay
[918.72 --> 919.54]  Full price
[919.54 --> 920.12]  For something
[920.12 --> 921.70]  My understanding
[921.70 --> 923.16]  And your understanding
[923.16 --> 924.06]  Should be
[924.06 --> 924.86]  That it
[924.86 --> 925.92]  Belongs to you
[925.92 --> 927.34]  And so
[927.34 --> 928.08]  The fact that
[928.08 --> 928.72]  Anyone
[928.72 --> 930.06]  Is not offended
[930.06 --> 930.66]  By this
[930.66 --> 932.22]  That anyone
[932.22 --> 933.20]  Sees this behavior
[933.20 --> 933.58]  And goes
[933.58 --> 934.40]  Yeah this is good
[934.40 --> 935.72]  It's just
[935.72 --> 936.66]  Baffling to me
[936.66 --> 937.80]  And if you make
[937.80 --> 938.42]  The choice
[938.42 --> 939.18]  To only use
[939.18 --> 939.76]  The App Store
[939.76 --> 941.36]  By all means
[941.36 --> 943.46]  But when I say
[943.46 --> 944.44]  I shouldn't have to
[944.44 --> 945.14]  Again
[945.14 --> 945.90]  Sit down
[945.90 --> 946.62]  And shut the
[946.62 --> 947.16]  F*** up
[947.16 --> 948.98]  It's that simple
[948.98 --> 950.34]  Yeah
[950.34 --> 952.88]  Nice
[952.88 --> 955.56]  Oh
[955.56 --> 956.52]  Dan's not here
[956.52 --> 957.14]  To move the
[957.14 --> 958.32]  The cards
[958.32 --> 959.52]  How will we know
[959.52 --> 960.22]  What to do
[960.22 --> 960.98]  He's supposed to
[960.98 --> 961.94]  Tell us
[961.94 --> 962.44]  Through our
[962.44 --> 965.34]  Well we don't need
[965.34 --> 965.98]  Ten more minutes
[965.98 --> 966.74]  Because we
[966.74 --> 967.58]  Both agreed
[967.58 --> 968.78]  That Apple
[968.78 --> 969.42]  Is being
[969.42 --> 970.62]  Buttheads
[970.62 --> 971.18]  Yeah
[971.18 --> 971.92]  I'm really looking
[971.92 --> 972.34]  Forward to
[972.34 --> 973.76]  Trying the Vision Pro
[973.76 --> 974.26]  Though
[974.26 --> 975.02]  Yeah
[975.02 --> 975.74]  Yeah
[975.74 --> 976.34]  Real heavy
[976.34 --> 976.88]  Yeah we're getting
[976.88 --> 977.60]  Our hands on
[977.60 --> 978.30]  We're getting our
[978.30 --> 978.96]  Hands on one
[978.96 --> 979.86]  February 4th
[979.86 --> 980.70]  I think ours arrives
[980.70 --> 981.58]  You gotta do neck workouts
[981.58 --> 982.84]  Okay
[982.84 --> 983.80]  I am not
[983.80 --> 984.60]  I don't know how exaggerated
[984.60 --> 985.02]  This is
[985.02 --> 985.62]  I am not doing any
[985.62 --> 986.26]  Neck workouts
[986.26 --> 987.14]  I am going to
[987.14 --> 988.26]  I'm gonna go in cold
[988.26 --> 990.00]  And see if it's
[990.00 --> 990.80]  Overblown
[990.80 --> 992.04]  As someone who
[992.04 --> 993.24]  Regularly wears
[993.24 --> 993.82]  Headphones
[993.82 --> 995.08]  And who regularly
[995.08 --> 996.10]  VR's
[996.10 --> 997.74]  I suspect
[997.74 --> 998.36]  That it's not
[998.36 --> 998.96]  Gonna bother me
[998.96 --> 999.42]  As much as
[999.42 --> 1000.00]  People who do
[1000.00 --> 1000.88]  Not regularly
[1000.88 --> 1001.26]  VR
[1001.26 --> 1001.82]  How much does it
[1001.82 --> 1002.30]  Weigh versus
[1002.30 --> 1002.92]  Like an index
[1002.92 --> 1003.90]  But I have heard
[1003.90 --> 1004.70]  It is quite heavy
[1004.70 --> 1005.48]  Yes
[1005.48 --> 1008.10]  Please show
[1008.10 --> 1008.62]  Dan Cam
[1008.62 --> 1008.98]  Okay
[1008.98 --> 1010.84]  A wild Dan
[1010.84 --> 1011.24]  Appears
[1011.24 --> 1011.86]  There's Dan
[1011.86 --> 1012.88]  Oh sorry
[1012.88 --> 1013.58]  I mean a wild
[1013.58 --> 1015.80]  NAD
[1015.80 --> 1016.82]  Appears
[1016.82 --> 1017.50]  A non
[1017.50 --> 1018.98]  Non infringing
[1018.98 --> 1022.02]  All resemblances
[1022.02 --> 1023.38]  Coincidental
[1023.38 --> 1027.16]  Does anyone
[1027.16 --> 1028.22]  See where I'm
[1028.22 --> 1028.76]  Going with this
[1028.76 --> 1031.04]  I don't really
[1031.04 --> 1031.64]  Get the point
[1031.64 --> 1032.44]  We copied
[1032.44 --> 1033.72]  It's a very
[1033.72 --> 1034.64]  Similar character
[1034.64 --> 1035.48]  Model but it's
[1035.48 --> 1035.94]  Not the same
[1035.94 --> 1036.40]  Thing
[1036.40 --> 1037.50]  Oh so like
[1037.50 --> 1038.02]  Pal world
[1038.02 --> 1038.86]  I'm
[1038.86 --> 1041.68]  Don't worry
[1041.68 --> 1042.24]  About it
[1042.24 --> 1043.18]  NAD stands
[1043.18 --> 1043.78]  For not a
[1043.78 --> 1044.08]  Dan
[1044.08 --> 1048.64]  I'm made of
[1048.64 --> 1049.42]  AI now
[1049.42 --> 1051.06]  Yeah I
[1051.06 --> 1052.58]  Apologize in
[1052.58 --> 1053.30]  Advance for the
[1053.30 --> 1053.74]  Fact that
[1053.74 --> 1054.26]  NAD is
[1054.26 --> 1054.74]  Probably going
[1054.74 --> 1055.26]  To stick as
[1055.26 --> 1055.62]  A nickname
[1055.62 --> 1056.08]  For you
[1056.08 --> 1061.26]  I could be
[1061.26 --> 1061.86]  Worse Dan
[1061.86 --> 1062.12]  That's fine
[1062.12 --> 1063.30]  Yeah
[1063.30 --> 1063.84]  Wait what
[1063.84 --> 1064.00]  You mean
[1064.00 --> 1064.74]  NAD
[1064.74 --> 1067.44]  It looks like
[1067.44 --> 1067.74]  Does the
[1067.74 --> 1068.76]  Index weigh more
[1068.76 --> 1070.14]  Yeah it looks
[1070.14 --> 1070.80]  Like the Index
[1070.80 --> 1071.60]  Weighs more than
[1071.60 --> 1072.22]  The Vision Pro
[1072.22 --> 1072.94]  So
[1072.94 --> 1073.62]  It's going to be
[1073.62 --> 1074.10]  Fine then
[1074.10 --> 1074.82]  Yeah so it's
[1074.82 --> 1075.36]  Probably going to
[1075.36 --> 1075.72]  Be fine
[1075.72 --> 1075.84]  What's everyone
[1075.84 --> 1076.56]  Freaking out about
[1076.56 --> 1078.66]  It's Apple
[1078.66 --> 1079.32]  Right
[1079.32 --> 1080.94]  So on the one
[1080.94 --> 1081.62]  Hand you have
[1081.62 --> 1082.16]  The things that
[1082.16 --> 1082.84]  Apple does
[1082.84 --> 1084.02]  That are actually
[1084.02 --> 1084.90]  Really scummy
[1084.90 --> 1085.74]  Yeah
[1085.74 --> 1086.34]  And then you've
[1086.34 --> 1086.88]  Got people that
[1086.88 --> 1087.32]  Are just like
[1087.32 --> 1088.12]  No man this
[1088.12 --> 1088.72]  Seems fine
[1088.72 --> 1089.78]  And then on the
[1089.78 --> 1090.26]  Other hand
[1090.26 --> 1091.38]  You've got what
[1091.38 --> 1092.46]  Appears to be
[1092.46 --> 1094.26]  A very compelling
[1094.26 --> 1094.78]  Product
[1094.78 --> 1096.82]  That could change
[1096.82 --> 1097.46]  Computing
[1097.46 --> 1098.80]  We'll see
[1098.80 --> 1100.16]  And people are
[1100.16 --> 1100.42]  Like
[1100.42 --> 1102.48]  Oh my god
[1102.48 --> 1103.16]  It needs to be
[1103.16 --> 1104.10]  Cooled
[1104.10 --> 1105.76]  They need
[1105.76 --> 1106.54]  Cooling in it
[1106.54 --> 1107.08]  And there's like
[1107.08 --> 1107.94]  There's glass
[1107.94 --> 1108.78]  Lenses and
[1108.78 --> 1109.80]  Glass is heavy
[1109.80 --> 1110.34]  Ugh
[1110.34 --> 1112.32]  It's like
[1112.32 --> 1113.14]  People are saying
[1113.14 --> 1114.30]  Because it's not
[1114.30 --> 1115.10]  As well balanced
[1115.10 --> 1117.00]  And because the
[1117.00 --> 1117.64]  Strap apparently
[1117.64 --> 1118.20]  Isn't as good
[1118.20 --> 1118.98]  The Index ain't
[1118.98 --> 1119.70]  That well balanced
[1119.70 --> 1120.66]  So I would have
[1120.66 --> 1121.34]  Hoped that Apple
[1121.34 --> 1121.88]  Would get the
[1121.88 --> 1122.80]  Strap right though
[1122.80 --> 1124.10]  I mean then again
[1124.10 --> 1124.72]  That's like
[1124.72 --> 1125.38]  I don't know
[1125.38 --> 1126.22]  Kind of their thing
[1126.22 --> 1126.86]  Is they have
[1126.86 --> 1127.74]  Okay accessories
[1127.74 --> 1128.48]  And then other
[1128.48 --> 1129.14]  People fill in
[1129.14 --> 1129.56]  The gaps
[1129.56 --> 1130.62]  So maybe it's
[1130.62 --> 1131.36]  Maybe it's fine
[1131.36 --> 1133.64]  One thing I'm
[1133.64 --> 1134.86]  Really excited for
[1134.86 --> 1135.64]  Though is that
[1135.64 --> 1136.62]  Apparently it comes
[1136.62 --> 1137.56]  With Apple's
[1137.56 --> 1138.36]  Cleaning cloth
[1138.36 --> 1141.08]  Now we missed
[1141.08 --> 1141.86]  The initial
[1141.86 --> 1142.98]  Outrage train
[1142.98 --> 1143.84]  On the $40
[1143.84 --> 1145.08]  Cleaning cloth
[1145.08 --> 1146.36]  Oh it's included
[1146.36 --> 1146.66]  Though
[1146.66 --> 1147.62]  Yeah yeah yeah
[1147.62 --> 1148.98]  So we were like
[1148.98 --> 1150.14]  Well realistically
[1150.14 --> 1150.82]  There's no point
[1150.82 --> 1151.44]  Making a video
[1151.44 --> 1152.00]  About this
[1152.00 --> 1153.14]  Because people
[1153.14 --> 1153.60]  Have kind of
[1153.60 --> 1154.10]  Got it out of
[1154.10 --> 1154.56]  Their system
[1154.56 --> 1155.60]  But it's not
[1155.60 --> 1156.02]  Like it ever
[1156.02 --> 1156.54]  Went away
[1156.54 --> 1158.22]  So I'm
[1158.22 --> 1158.54]  Going to get
[1158.54 --> 1159.18]  An opportunity
[1159.18 --> 1160.96]  To check out
[1160.96 --> 1162.42]  Apple's cleaning
[1162.42 --> 1162.88]  Cloth
[1162.88 --> 1163.50]  Nice
[1163.50 --> 1164.16]  Yeah
[1164.16 --> 1164.88]  Yeah
[1164.88 --> 1165.36]  I can't believe
[1165.36 --> 1165.84]  It's free
[1165.84 --> 1166.56]  I'm pretty stoked
[1166.56 --> 1167.00]  On that
[1167.00 --> 1169.60]  I doubt it's
[1169.60 --> 1169.88]  Going to get
[1169.88 --> 1170.50]  Much air time
[1170.50 --> 1171.00]  In the video
[1171.00 --> 1171.76]  I've kind of
[1171.76 --> 1172.54]  Said my piece
[1172.54 --> 1173.24]  About Apple's
[1173.24 --> 1173.64]  Pricing
[1173.64 --> 1174.40]  We did a video
[1174.40 --> 1175.46]  A number of
[1175.46 --> 1175.88]  Years ago
[1175.88 --> 1176.26]  When they
[1176.26 --> 1176.98]  Announced the
[1176.98 --> 1178.34]  $700 wheels
[1178.34 --> 1179.36]  For the
[1179.36 --> 1180.42]  Old Intel
[1180.42 --> 1180.94]  Mac Pro
[1180.94 --> 1184.12]  2019 Mac Pro
[1184.12 --> 1184.62]  Or whatever
[1184.62 --> 1185.04]  I have to
[1185.04 --> 1185.72]  Memorize years
[1185.72 --> 1186.26]  Instead of
[1186.26 --> 1187.02]  Just generations
[1187.02 --> 1188.00]  Because I don't
[1188.00 --> 1188.36]  Know Apple
[1188.36 --> 1188.64]  Things
[1188.64 --> 1191.16]  Where I
[1191.16 --> 1191.84]  Basically talked
[1191.84 --> 1192.38]  About how
[1192.38 --> 1193.24]  It has
[1193.24 --> 1195.14]  I actually
[1195.14 --> 1195.62]  Forget my
[1195.62 --> 1196.00]  Point but
[1196.00 --> 1196.20]  It was a
[1196.20 --> 1196.62]  Good point
[1196.62 --> 1197.30]  And it
[1197.30 --> 1197.74]  Pretty much
[1197.74 --> 1198.54]  Explained why
[1198.54 --> 1199.12]  Apple prices
[1199.12 --> 1199.68]  Things the way
[1199.68 --> 1200.04]  They do
[1200.04 --> 1200.48]  It's because
[1200.48 --> 1200.88]  They want to
[1200.88 --> 1201.36]  Be a luxury
[1201.36 --> 1201.68]  Brand
[1201.68 --> 1202.46]  They're a
[1202.46 --> 1202.72]  Consumer
[1202.72 --> 1203.22]  Electronics
[1203.22 --> 1203.72]  Brand but
[1203.72 --> 1204.12]  They really
[1204.12 --> 1204.36]  Really
[1204.36 --> 1204.60]  Really
[1204.60 --> 1204.80]  Really
[1204.80 --> 1205.38]  Want to be
[1205.38 --> 1205.74]  A luxury
[1205.74 --> 1206.06]  Brand
[1206.06 --> 1206.46]  And that's
[1206.46 --> 1206.78]  An image
[1206.78 --> 1207.08]  That they
[1207.08 --> 1207.44]  Project
[1207.44 --> 1208.30]  And it's
[1208.30 --> 1208.54]  An image
[1208.54 --> 1208.84]  That some
[1208.84 --> 1209.40]  People buy
[1209.40 --> 1209.88]  Like it's
[1209.88 --> 1210.36]  The whole
[1210.36 --> 1211.02]  Blue bubble
[1211.02 --> 1211.58]  Green bubble
[1211.58 --> 1211.98]  Thing has
[1211.98 --> 1212.30]  Always been
[1212.30 --> 1212.80]  Baffling to
[1212.80 --> 1212.90]  Me
[1212.90 --> 1213.12]  You can get
[1213.12 --> 1213.68]  iPhone for
[1213.68 --> 1214.20]  Like $100
[1214.20 --> 1215.22]  On eBay
[1215.22 --> 1215.62]  That'll
[1215.62 --> 1216.52]  Like get
[1216.52 --> 1216.92]  Your bubble
[1216.92 --> 1217.24]  Color
[1217.24 --> 1217.54]  Whatever
[1217.54 --> 1218.02]  Who cares
[1218.02 --> 1219.82]  I don't
[1219.82 --> 1219.94]  It should
[1219.94 --> 1220.34]  Change the
[1220.34 --> 1220.66]  Shade
[1220.66 --> 1221.10]  I don't
[1221.10 --> 1221.58]  Really see
[1221.58 --> 1221.98]  How
[1221.98 --> 1222.32]  Based on
[1222.32 --> 1222.76]  The generation
[1222.76 --> 1223.22]  Of phone
[1223.22 --> 1225.50]  Can you
[1225.50 --> 1227.24]  Not give
[1227.24 --> 1227.70]  Them ideas
[1227.70 --> 1228.44]  Or no
[1228.44 --> 1228.90]  No
[1228.90 --> 1229.44]  You know
[1229.44 --> 1229.72]  People
[1229.72 --> 1230.78]  The newest
[1230.78 --> 1231.32]  One should
[1231.32 --> 1231.68]  Be the
[1231.68 --> 1232.12]  Deepest
[1232.12 --> 1232.48]  Blue
[1232.48 --> 1233.28]  And as
[1233.28 --> 1233.76]  Your phone
[1233.76 --> 1234.20]  Ages
[1234.20 --> 1234.82]  It should
[1234.82 --> 1235.40]  Fade
[1235.40 --> 1237.56]  You
[1237.56 --> 1238.14]  That way
[1238.14 --> 1238.68]  That way
[1238.68 --> 1239.04]  They don't
[1239.04 --> 1239.40]  Have to
[1239.40 --> 1240.24]  Like update
[1240.24 --> 1240.68]  They're
[1240.68 --> 1240.98]  Never gonna
[1240.98 --> 1241.66]  Run out

[1244.78 --> 1245.68]  UV reactive
[1245.68 --> 1246.16]  Paint

[2143.56 --> 2143.74]  That
[2143.74 --> 2143.98]  One
[2143.98 --> 2144.34]  Because
[2144.34 --> 2144.58]  They
[2144.58 --> 2145.06]  Didn't

[2145.48 --> 2145.58]  An

[2145.92 --> 2146.24]  Because
[2146.24 --> 2146.46]  It
[2146.46 --> 2146.96]  Wasn't
[2146.96 --> 2147.40]  Possible
[2147.40 --> 2147.62]  It
[2147.62 --> 2147.88]  Turned
[2147.88 --> 2148.10]  Out
[2148.10 --> 2149.30]  And
[2149.30 --> 2150.88]  My
[2150.88 --> 2151.52]  Understanding
[2151.52 --> 2151.80]  Is
[2151.80 --> 2151.98]  That
[2151.98 --> 2152.14]  Would
[2152.14 --> 2152.28]  Have

[2152.76 --> 2153.00]  Can't
[2153.00 --> 2153.10]  Think
[2153.10 --> 2153.20]  Of

[2153.38 --> 2153.62]  Whose
[2153.62 --> 2153.82]  Fault
[2153.82 --> 2153.98]  That
[2153.98 --> 2154.08]  Would
[2154.08 --> 2154.18]  Have
[2154.18 --> 2154.28]  Been
[2154.28 --> 2154.46]  Other

[2154.62 --> 2155.06]  NVIDIA
[2155.06 --> 2155.88]  I
[2155.88 --> 2156.10]  Can't
[2156.10 --> 2156.20]  Think

[2156.40 --> 2156.70]  Reason
[2156.70 --> 2157.06]  MSI
[2157.06 --> 2157.18]  Would
[2157.18 --> 2157.30]  Have

[2157.56 --> 2157.78]  That
[2157.78 --> 2157.94]  Other
[2157.94 --> 2158.10]  Than
[2158.10 --> 2158.22]  That
[2158.22 --> 2158.34]  They
[2158.34 --> 2158.70]  Thought
[2158.70 --> 2159.00]  That
[2159.00 --> 2159.10]  They

[2160.24 --> 2160.58]  Partner
[2160.58 --> 2160.96]  That
[2160.96 --> 2161.52]  Would
[2161.52 --> 2161.74]  Allow

[2162.44 --> 2162.74]  Upgrade
[2162.74 --> 2163.34]  Laptop
[2163.34 --> 2163.84]  So
[2163.84 --> 2164.04]  The
[2164.04 --> 2164.34]  Point
[2164.34 --> 2164.50]  I'm
[2164.50 --> 2164.68]  Getting

[2165.16 --> 2165.26]  Of
[2165.26 --> 2165.48]  This
[2165.48 --> 2166.10]  Is
[2166.10 --> 2166.46]  That
[2166.46 --> 2167.66]  This
[2167.66 --> 2168.14]  Was
[2168.14 --> 2168.48]  An
[2168.48 --> 2168.92]  Innovation
[2168.92 --> 2170.08]  And
[2170.08 --> 2170.22]  It
[2170.22 --> 2170.50]  Is
[2170.50 --> 2170.72]  One
[2170.72 --> 2170.90]  That
[2170.90 --> 2171.44]  Matters
[2171.44 --> 2171.64]  Because
[2171.64 --> 2171.96]  The
[2171.96 --> 2172.22]  Way
[2172.22 --> 2172.42]  That
[2172.42 --> 2172.88]  Framework
[2172.88 --> 2173.10]  Has
[2173.10 --> 2173.40]  Done
[2173.40 --> 2173.64]  It
[2173.64 --> 2174.86]  Solves
[2174.86 --> 2175.18]  A
[2175.18 --> 2175.38]  Lot
[2175.38 --> 2175.48]  Of

[2177.38 --> 2177.72]  Doesn't
[2177.72 --> 2178.04]  Solve
[2178.04 --> 2178.32]  All
[2178.32 --> 2178.46]  Of

[2181.62 --> 2181.78]  Me
[2181.78 --> 2181.90]  And
[2181.90 --> 2182.08]  This
[2182.08 --> 2182.38]  Is
[2182.38 --> 2183.16]  Quite

[2257.30 --> 2258.36]  It's
[2258.36 --> 2258.82]  Complicated
[2258.82 --> 2259.32]  Okay
[2259.32 --> 2259.66]  Yeah
[2259.66 --> 2260.52]  But
[2260.52 --> 2261.10]  Pegatron

[2894.32 --> 2894.44]  Would
[2894.44 --> 2894.68]  Work
[2894.68 --> 2894.84]  Way
[2894.84 --> 2895.04]  Better
[2895.04 --> 2895.22]  For
[2895.22 --> 2895.46]  That
[2895.46 --> 2895.92]  Okay
[2895.92 --> 2896.14]  I
[2896.14 --> 2898.28]  Just
[2898.28 --> 2898.40]  Wish
[2898.40 --> 2898.48]  It
[2898.48 --> 2898.60]  Was
[2898.60 --> 2899.14]  A

[2899.64 --> 2900.00]  Bigger
[2900.00 --> 2900.34]  Another
[2900.34 --> 2900.80]  Sacrifice
[2900.80 --> 2901.02]  For

[2901.62 --> 2901.96]  One
[2901.96 --> 2902.24]  Decision
[2902.24 --> 2902.44]  I
[2902.44 --> 2902.82]  Really
[2902.82 --> 2903.06]  Don't
[2903.06 --> 2903.50]  Understand
[2903.50 --> 2903.70]  Though
[2903.70 --> 2903.94]  Are
[2903.94 --> 2904.08]  The
[2904.08 --> 2904.36]  Speakers
[2904.36 --> 2904.54]  Which
[2904.54 --> 2904.80]  Fire
[2904.80 --> 2905.16]  Out
[2905.16 --> 2905.28]  From
[2905.28 --> 2905.42]  The
[2905.42 --> 2905.76]  Sides
[2905.76 --> 2906.20]  Instead
[2906.20 --> 2906.38]  Of

[2906.92 --> 2907.12]  At
[2907.12 --> 2907.26]  You

[2908.72 --> 2908.98]  Else
[2908.98 --> 2909.30]  To
[2909.30 --> 2909.50]  Be
[2909.50 --> 2909.90]  Clear
[2909.90 --> 2910.36]  That
[2910.36 --> 2910.58]  Can
[2910.58 --> 2910.80]  Work
[2910.80 --> 2911.26]  Really
[2911.26 --> 2911.62]  Well
[2911.62 --> 2912.14]  I've
[2912.14 --> 2912.32]  Seen
[2912.32 --> 2912.56]  Some

[2913.96 --> 2914.34]  Firing
[2914.34 --> 2914.90]  Speakers
[2914.90 --> 2915.28]  That
[2915.28 --> 2915.70]  Use
[2915.70 --> 2917.46]  Algorithmic
[2917.46 --> 2918.12]  Nonsense
[2918.12 --> 2918.48]  To
[2918.48 --> 2918.80]  Sound
[2918.80 --> 2919.24]  Great
[2919.24 --> 2920.22]  But
[2920.22 --> 2920.42]  So
[2920.42 --> 2920.66]  Has
[2920.66 --> 2921.14]  Alex
[2921.14 --> 2921.42]  And
[2921.42 --> 2921.58]  I'm
[2921.58 --> 2921.74]  Sure
[2921.74 --> 2921.90]  He
[2921.90 --> 2922.14]  Wouldn't
[2922.14 --> 2922.32]  Bring
[2922.32 --> 2922.56]  This
[2922.56 --> 2922.78]  Up
[2922.78 --> 2923.02]  If
[2923.02 --> 2923.12]  It
[2923.12 --> 2923.40]  Wasn't
[2923.40 --> 2923.74]  Actually
[2923.74 --> 2923.88]  A
[2923.88 --> 2924.18]  Problem
[2924.18 --> 2924.44]  Yeah
[2924.44 --> 2924.70]  Fair
[2924.70 --> 2924.94]  Enough
[2924.94 --> 2925.84]  That
[2925.84 --> 2926.06]  Sounds
[2926.06 --> 2926.26]  Good
[2926.26 --> 2926.60]  For
[2926.60 --> 2926.94]  Comparison
[2926.94 --> 2927.22]  Here's
[2927.22 --> 2927.30]  A
[2927.30 --> 2927.48]  Similarly

[2931.26 --> 2931.68]  Lenovo
[2931.68 --> 2932.02]  Lenovo
[2932.02 --> 2932.14]  Is
[2932.14 --> 2932.34]  Not
[2932.34 --> 2932.54]  Too
[2932.54 --> 2932.74]  Bad
[2932.74 --> 2932.84]  A
[2932.84 --> 2932.94]  Little
[2932.94 --> 2933.10]  Bit
[2933.10 --> 2933.38]  Quiet
[2933.38 --> 2933.72]  But
[2933.72 --> 2933.80]  I
[2933.80 --> 2933.88]  Would
[2933.88 --> 2933.98]  Say
[2933.98 --> 2934.34]  Perfectly
[2934.34 --> 2934.72]  Acceptable
[2934.72 --> 2934.86]  And
[2934.86 --> 2934.96]  The
[2934.96 --> 2935.30]  Framework
[2935.30 --> 2935.52]  Is
[2935.52 --> 2935.90]  Uh
[2935.90 --> 2938.54]  It's
[2938.54 --> 2938.68]  Not
[2938.68 --> 2938.84]  The
[2938.84 --> 2939.06]  Worst
[2939.06 --> 2939.20]  I've
[2939.20 --> 2939.34]  Ever
[2939.34 --> 2939.60]  Heard
[2939.60 --> 2939.78]  But
[2939.78 --> 2939.92]  It
[2939.92 --> 2940.16]  Lags
[2940.16 --> 2940.46]  Some
[2940.46 --> 2941.10]  Treble
[2941.10 --> 2941.64]  And
[2950.42 --> 2950.54]  He
[2950.54 --> 2950.72]  Wants
[2950.72 --> 2950.80]  Me
[2950.80 --> 2950.86]  To
[2950.86 --> 2951.12]  Complain
[2951.12 --> 2951.32]  About
[2951.32 --> 2951.58]  This
[2951.58 --> 2951.70]  Not
[2951.70 --> 2951.82]  Being

[2952.18 --> 2952.38]  Display
[2952.38 --> 2952.54]  Port
[2952.54 --> 2952.74]  But
[2952.74 --> 2953.18]  Personally
[2953.18 --> 2953.26]  I
[2953.26 --> 2953.34]  Think
[2953.34 --> 2953.74]  Type C
[2953.74 --> 2953.82]  Is
[2953.82 --> 2954.00]  Fine
[2954.00 --> 2954.20]  So
[2954.20 --> 2954.52]  One
[2954.52 --> 2954.72]  Second
[2954.72 --> 2955.08]  I
[2955.08 --> 2956.38]  Think
[2956.38 --> 2956.80]  Type C
[2956.80 --> 2957.02]  Makes
[2957.02 --> 2957.18]  Sense
[2957.18 --> 2957.30]  For
[2957.30 --> 2957.72]  Laptop
[2957.72 --> 2958.12]  Personally
[2958.12 --> 2958.58]  We
[2958.58 --> 2958.84]  Asked
[2958.84 --> 2958.90]  And
[2958.90 --> 2959.00]  They
[2959.00 --> 2959.14]  Said
[2959.14 --> 2959.26]  They
[2959.26 --> 2959.68]  Tried
[2959.68 --> 2959.94]  It
[2959.94 --> 2960.08]  Just
[2960.08 --> 2960.28]  Wouldn't
[2960.28 --> 2960.46]  Fit
[2960.46 --> 2960.56]  With
[2960.56 --> 2960.66]  The

[2961.98 --> 2962.10]  It
[2962.10 --> 2962.38]  But
[2962.38 --> 2962.50]  For
[2962.50 --> 2962.84]  F**k
[2962.84 --> 2963.04]  Sakes

[2977.04 --> 2977.80]  No

[2982.78 --> 2982.88]  Is
[2982.88 --> 2982.98]  How
[2982.98 --> 2983.08]  I
[2983.08 --> 2983.34]  Describe
[2983.34 --> 2983.46]  The

[2985.58 --> 2985.96]  Actually
[2985.96 --> 2986.24]  Pretty
[2986.24 --> 2986.60]  Funny
[2986.60 --> 2987.50]  So
[2987.50 --> 2987.70]  You
[2987.70 --> 2987.88]  Could
[2987.88 --> 2988.12]  Just
[2988.12 --> 2988.50]  Have
[2988.50 --> 2988.94]  Your

[2998.38 --> 2999.18]  So
[2999.18 --> 2999.58]  There
[2999.58 --> 2999.76]  Can
[2999.76 --> 2999.88]  Be

[3003.20 --> 3003.42]  It
[3003.42 --> 3004.04]  You
[3004.04 --> 3004.36]  Not
[3004.36 --> 3004.72]  Huge

[3004.92 --> 3005.08]  It's
[3005.08 --> 3005.34]  There
[3005.34 --> 3005.86]  And
[3005.86 --> 3005.96]  Then
[3005.96 --> 3006.08]  You
[3006.08 --> 3006.18]  Can
[3006.18 --> 3006.34]  Just
[3006.34 --> 3006.82]  Have
[3006.82 --> 3007.06]  That

[3023.04 --> 3023.42]  Expanded
[3023.42 --> 3023.66]  Storage
[3023.66 --> 3024.08]  But
[3024.08 --> 3024.40]  They
[3024.40 --> 3024.54]  Also
[3024.54 --> 3024.78]  Released
[3024.78 --> 3024.90]  The
[3024.90 --> 3025.10]  Design
[3025.10 --> 3025.30]  So
[3025.30 --> 3025.46]  Literally
[3025.46 --> 3025.82]  Anyone
[3025.82 --> 3025.98]  With
[3025.98 --> 3026.06]  The
[3026.06 --> 3026.20]  Right
[3026.20 --> 3026.42]  Skills
[3026.42 --> 3026.60]  Can
[3026.60 --> 3026.90]  Design
[3026.90 --> 3027.06]  And
[3027.06 --> 3027.22]  Sell
[3027.22 --> 3027.34]  Their
[3027.34 --> 3027.72]  Modules
[3027.72 --> 3028.32]  Including
[3028.32 --> 3028.54]  For
[3028.54 --> 3028.62]  The
[3028.62 --> 3028.84]  GPU
[3028.84 --> 3029.10]  Slot
[3029.10 --> 3029.26]  Now
[3029.26 --> 3029.44]  Even
[3029.44 --> 3029.54]  When
[3029.54 --> 3029.64]  There
[3029.64 --> 3029.86]  Isn't
[3029.86 --> 3029.96]  A
[3029.96 --> 3030.16]  GPU
[3030.16 --> 3030.52]  Installed
[3030.52 --> 3030.74]  Some
[3030.74 --> 3030.82]  Of
[3030.82 --> 3030.92]  That
[3030.92 --> 3031.10]  Space
[3031.10 --> 3031.20]  Is
[3031.20 --> 3031.58]  Occupied
[3031.58 --> 3031.70]  By
[3031.70 --> 3031.78]  The
[3031.78 --> 3032.06]  CPU
[3032.06 --> 3032.40]  Cooling
[3044.34 --> 3046.54]  I
[3046.60 --> 3048.16]  your needs change or you want to do something silly,
[3048.32 --> 3049.54]  like running four displays off your laptop.
[3049.76 --> 3051.62]  You don't need a dongle, at least not an external one.
[3051.76 --> 3052.38]  Now, speaking of external,
[3052.50 --> 3054.76]  the power brick is this cute little 180 watt gallium nitride unit,
[3054.88 --> 3057.04]  and it's the highest wattage type C charger I've ever heard of,
[3057.10 --> 3058.46]  and a far cry, at least in terms of size,
[3058.50 --> 3059.56]  for most gaming laptop power bricks.
[3059.84 --> 3060.42]  Good job there, framework.
[3060.70 --> 3062.82]  Also improved from their first laptop is the disassembly experience.
[3062.82 --> 3065.84]  In fairness to other laptop manufacturers,
[3066.42 --> 3071.40]  the framework is big, but it's not super powerful.
[3071.94 --> 3078.06]  Like that GPU is not a mobile 4090 or a mobile 4080 or whatever else.
[3078.08 --> 3079.66]  So just, you know, something to consider.
[3080.38 --> 3081.84]  Screws are accessible from the top of the laptop.
[3082.04 --> 3084.28]  So replacing any part of this laptop is an absolute joy.
[3084.44 --> 3085.62]  Now, if you're not an experienced tinkerer,
[3085.78 --> 3087.94]  framework has guides for replacing literally every part of the laptop.
[3087.94 --> 3089.26]  That's because if you're a nerd,
[3089.54 --> 3091.58]  you can buy this laptop Ikea style and put it together yourself.
[3091.78 --> 3094.42]  And I take assembling a framework laptop over doing Ikea furniture any day of the week.
[3094.60 --> 3095.62]  If you miss our framework factory tour,
[3095.74 --> 3098.08]  a little tidbit is that they actually pre-assemble the DIY edition laptops
[3098.08 --> 3099.20]  for QC and stress testing,
[3099.34 --> 3101.16]  and then they get taken apart before shipping and build it yourself.
[3101.40 --> 3102.02]  Don't believe it's that easy?
[3102.14 --> 3104.18]  Well, it took about this long to get the entire laptop to pieces.
[3104.44 --> 3105.58]  We've got the 85 watt hour battery,
[3105.72 --> 3106.60]  556E module,
[3106.80 --> 3107.52]  Seven minutes.
[3108.04 --> 3108.74]  That's really fast.
[3109.12 --> 3110.36]  That's really impressive.
[3110.42 --> 3111.32]  It's like wicked fast.
[3112.54 --> 3113.34]  Oh, hey,
[3113.64 --> 3116.42]  speaking of framework laptops being wicked fast,
[3116.82 --> 3121.10]  I saw someone in chat earlier asking about the Electro Boom collab.
[3121.22 --> 3121.82]  When's it coming?
[3122.10 --> 3122.24]  Yeah.
[3122.32 --> 3125.18]  Because that includes a framework build challenge.
[3125.56 --> 3125.80]  Oh.
[3125.80 --> 3128.94]  Where every additional minute I take to assemble it,
[3129.26 --> 3133.08]  he turns up the value on the dog collar,
[3133.88 --> 3136.92]  the dog shock collar that's attached to my neck.
[3137.12 --> 3138.70]  And then once I'm done,
[3139.04 --> 3140.12]  he gets to press it.
[3140.26 --> 3140.78]  Oh, wow.
[3140.92 --> 3142.92]  So I had to try to speed build one.
[3143.00 --> 3143.26]  Anyway.
[3143.40 --> 3144.22]  How fast did you do it?
[3144.22 --> 3145.64]  Well, I'm not going to spoil the video.
[3145.76 --> 3148.74]  The point is that video is coming out hopefully Monday.
[3150.18 --> 3151.08]  So stay tuned.
[3151.18 --> 3151.56]  Very cool.
[3152.22 --> 3153.94]  7700 S inside the GPU module,
[3154.26 --> 3156.94]  a Ryzen 78 or 7940 HS powered mainboard,
[3157.18 --> 3158.16]  two DDR5 sodium slots,
[3158.40 --> 3159.30]  two Gen 4 M.2 slots.
[3159.44 --> 3160.56]  And if you're not happy with the configurations,
[3160.66 --> 3161.36]  you can see on screen here,
[3161.50 --> 3163.58]  the DIY edition can be ordered in pretty much any config you want
[3163.58 --> 3164.50]  or bare bones.
[3164.56 --> 3165.24]  And you can call your own storage,
[3165.34 --> 3168.32]  which made picking laptops to benchmark against a little tricky.
[3168.32 --> 3170.92]  To see what you can get in a similarly priced and classed big name laptop,
[3170.92 --> 3173.52]  we opted for an Intel NVIDIA spec Lenovo Legion Slim 7i.
[3173.52 --> 3173.72]  Wow.
[3173.72 --> 3174.62]  That is a better spec.
[3175.90 --> 3177.62]  That was a much faster GPU.
[3177.90 --> 3181.46]  I am not excited to see how much faster that is going to be.
[3181.48 --> 3182.42]  Picking laptops to benchmark against?
[3182.44 --> 3183.54]  A little tricky.
[3183.70 --> 3186.12]  To see what you can get in a similarly priced and classed big name laptop,
[3186.24 --> 3186.96]  we opted for an Intel.
[3188.30 --> 3189.22]  That's a lot of RAM.
[3189.52 --> 3189.74]  Yeah.
[3189.94 --> 3190.88]  That's a big battery.
[3191.12 --> 3191.32]  Yeah.
[3192.38 --> 3193.64]  That's a really fast CPU,
[3193.64 --> 3197.64]  although I think the framework will probably hold its own when it comes to CPU.
[3198.12 --> 3200.36]  But that is a big GPU.
[3200.92 --> 3201.76]  Okay.
[3201.76 --> 3203.60]  NVIDIA spec Lenovo Legion Slim 7i.
[3203.78 --> 3205.18]  And to make sure our framework is performing as it should,
[3205.48 --> 3206.40]  an ASUS TUF A16.
[3206.64 --> 3207.06]  It's cheaper,
[3207.26 --> 3209.26]  and it was supposed to be the same specs as the framework 16.
[3209.44 --> 3211.78]  That was until they shipped the lower end model for the press unit.
[3212.08 --> 3213.24]  The differences between the CPUs are minor,
[3213.30 --> 3215.08]  so it should still tell us if the framework is performing up to snuff.
[3215.26 --> 3215.98]  Despite those differences,
[3216.14 --> 3217.70]  every game is actually a pretty tight race.
[3217.88 --> 3218.36]  In Cyberpunk,
[3218.50 --> 3219.60]  nearly maxed out at 1080p.
[3220.20 --> 3220.56]  Yeah,
[3220.60 --> 3220.98]  I want to see.
[3221.06 --> 3221.44]  Thank you.
[3223.34 --> 3223.70]  Okay.
[3224.56 --> 3229.86]  That is not nearly as far off the Lenovo Legion.
[3230.18 --> 3230.46]  Yeah.
[3230.92 --> 3231.96]  As I thought it might be.
[3232.86 --> 3233.26]  Like,
[3233.30 --> 3237.02]  if you're talking a difference in one FPS on 1% lows,
[3237.86 --> 3238.76]  all right,
[3238.98 --> 3240.98]  no one's going to notice that.
[3241.12 --> 3241.24]  Yeah,
[3241.26 --> 3241.70]  that's pretty good.
[3242.14 --> 3243.96]  The Intel-based Lenovo is slightly ahead in average FPS,
[3244.22 --> 3247.12]  with both itself and the AMD-based ASUS model beating the framework by one frame
[3247.12 --> 3247.90]  and 1% lows.
[3248.04 --> 3248.62]  In F123,
[3248.74 --> 3249.08]  Intel's getting...
[3249.08 --> 3249.64]  Okay,
[3249.64 --> 3250.46]  this is less good.
[3251.26 --> 3251.50]  Yeah.
[3252.36 --> 3256.40]  So now we're at closer to a 10% uplift on the Lenovo.
[3258.02 --> 3258.58]  Oh,
[3258.58 --> 3258.74]  wait,
[3258.74 --> 3258.96]  wait,
[3258.96 --> 3259.08]  wait,
[3259.14 --> 3260.70]  I thought the framework was still at the bottom.
[3260.88 --> 3261.02]  No,
[3261.06 --> 3261.18]  no,
[3261.18 --> 3261.30]  no,
[3261.30 --> 3261.52]  middle.
[3261.86 --> 3262.00]  Oh,
[3262.08 --> 3262.38]  tremendous.
[3262.62 --> 3262.88]  Okay,
[3262.98 --> 3263.58]  carry on.
[3266.32 --> 3267.60]  A modest showing in second place.
[3267.80 --> 3269.88]  Surprisingly beating out the on paper faster ASUS.
[3269.88 --> 3270.16]  Canada wet.
[3270.18 --> 3271.76]  To no one's surprise in Total War Warhammer 3,
[3271.90 --> 3272.92]  the 4070 wins again,
[3273.04 --> 3273.38]  but our...
[3273.38 --> 3274.36]  Yeah,
[3275.48 --> 3276.26]  this is...
[3276.26 --> 3277.18]  That's a decent jump.
[3277.18 --> 3280.78]  This is way closer than I thought this whole thing was going to be.
[3282.40 --> 3282.76]  Okay.
[3283.40 --> 3284.80]  Framework squeaks past the ASUS again,
[3284.88 --> 3285.10]  too.
[3285.42 --> 3287.44]  It's hard to say what exactly is giving it the advantage in these games,
[3287.52 --> 3290.18]  but the faster memory and better cooling on the framework likely has something to do with it.
[3290.26 --> 3290.74]  As for productivity,
[3290.90 --> 3292.36]  the Framework 16 loses handily in Cinebench,
[3292.46 --> 3293.42]  both single and multi-core,
[3293.60 --> 3294.28]  but no surprises there,
[3294.42 --> 3297.42]  as the ASUS has a lot more thermal headroom when it doesn't have a cool and GPU at the same time.
[3297.66 --> 3297.94]  In Blender,
[3298.04 --> 3299.52]  our ASUS laptop crushes the framework across the board,
[3299.72 --> 3302.18]  despite the only real difference being a slightly higher base and...
[3302.18 --> 3303.18]  Oh...
[3303.18 --> 3304.18]  Oh...
[3304.18 --> 3304.76]  ...toos clock,
[3304.98 --> 3306.32]  and the same can be said for video...
[3307.18 --> 3309.18]  Oh...
[3310.12 --> 3311.18]  I mean...
[3311.18 --> 3311.80]  Compared to the Lenovo?
[3312.58 --> 3312.90]  Yeah.
[3314.44 --> 3315.60]  The ASUS gap is large,
[3315.70 --> 3316.58]  but compared to the Lenovo,
[3316.64 --> 3317.22]  it's very close.
[3317.40 --> 3317.62]  Okay.
[3317.62 --> 3319.52]  ...and in media editing with Premiere and Photoshop.
[3319.78 --> 3320.04]  Overall,
[3320.20 --> 3320.98]  not a lot of surprises here.
[3321.10 --> 3322.64]  The faster CPU and the ASUS shines in productivity,
[3322.86 --> 3324.58]  but we expect the higher-end framework would yield the same result.
[3324.74 --> 3325.14]  As for gaming?
[3325.46 --> 3325.62]  Yeah.
[3326.00 --> 3327.30]  It's not a great price of performance option,
[3327.42 --> 3328.30]  but it's not terrible either.
[3328.46 --> 3329.82]  It's just that if you want the most frames for your money,
[3329.94 --> 3330.74]  this isn't the laptop to buy.
[3330.92 --> 3331.08]  Also,
[3331.08 --> 3331.90]  you should probably just buy a desktop.
[3332.26 --> 3333.20]  But if you do buy one,
[3333.20 --> 3335.50]  you should protect it with a skin.
[3335.64 --> 3336.64]  Very true.
[3336.64 --> 3337.70]  So Linus can show you how.
[3337.88 --> 3338.86]  Being a relatively new company,
[3339.00 --> 3340.86]  Rocks and third parties are making accessories for framing machines.
[3340.86 --> 3341.40]  It's pretty funny.
[3341.60 --> 3342.10]  You don't like it.
[3342.10 --> 3343.22]  But Dbrand sure is,
[3343.32 --> 3344.66]  and they're going to be ready for launch day.
[3344.90 --> 3345.56]  They send over two.
[3345.66 --> 3346.66]  Sure, it's an ad, but...
[3346.66 --> 3348.62]  I guess I could pick whichever one would be easier for Casetify to rip off.
[3350.20 --> 3350.98]  Oh, they're both the same.
[3351.16 --> 3351.64]  My notes say,
[3351.88 --> 3353.30]  look how accurate these internals are.
[3353.46 --> 3354.90]  No wonder they got so pissed they got ripped off,
[3354.96 --> 3356.70]  but I actually haven't had this thing open yet,
[3356.78 --> 3357.64]  so maybe?
[3358.42 --> 3358.78]  Probably.
[3359.22 --> 3361.96]  While I completely ignore Dbrand's explicit instructions
[3361.96 --> 3362.60]  for how to do this
[3362.60 --> 3363.50]  and make up my own method,
[3363.90 --> 3364.90]  always check their site
[3364.90 --> 3365.78]  and make sure that you do it the right way.
[3365.78 --> 3366.94]  What am I supposed to be saying though?
[3367.22 --> 3368.88]  I know they're paying me to put a skin on a laptop right now,
[3368.96 --> 3370.18]  but this is my favorite kind of integration.
[3370.32 --> 3371.78]  We're all working together to promote something we believe in.
[3371.84 --> 3372.08]  Yeah!
[3372.56 --> 3372.80]  Yeah!
[3373.28 --> 3374.30]  As both an investor and hobbyist,
[3374.34 --> 3374.88]  hey, thanks Dbrand.
[3375.10 --> 3375.38]  Shout out.
[3376.38 --> 3376.56]  Wow.
[3376.56 --> 3377.26]  So I think I've got it
[3377.26 --> 3379.28]  pretty decently lined up right now.
[3379.66 --> 3380.94]  There's no way this battery is made in Canada.
[3381.02 --> 3381.54]  That's got to be a mistake.
[3382.26 --> 3382.76]  Framework's Canadian.
[3382.84 --> 3383.42]  They're Canadian bros.
[3383.64 --> 3384.06]  Did I say framework?
[3384.18 --> 3384.38]  Dbrand.
[3385.56 --> 3386.12]  Framework's not Canadian.
[3386.12 --> 3387.36]  Oh, it's not quite straight.
[3388.00 --> 3388.36]  Wow.
[3388.96 --> 3390.08]  Oh, I bunged it, dude.
[3390.08 --> 3391.28]  I bunged it.
[3391.40 --> 3391.88]  Oh, no.
[3392.34 --> 3392.82]  Just don't look right there.
[3393.02 --> 3393.58]  Just don't look right where?
[3393.76 --> 3394.20]  Don't worry about it.
[3394.34 --> 3394.84]  Right where?
[3395.06 --> 3395.24]  Right where?
[3395.40 --> 3395.94]  It's not bad.
[3396.64 --> 3397.00]  Pretty flat.
[3397.28 --> 3397.44]  Yeah.
[3397.56 --> 3397.70]  Yeah.
[3398.08 --> 3398.44]  Oh, hey.
[3398.56 --> 3399.38]  Five foot one line.
[3399.76 --> 3400.88]  Oh, I know when I'm insulted.
[3401.46 --> 3402.06]  Check out Dbrand.
[3402.14 --> 3403.60]  Over to you, John.
[3403.86 --> 3405.58]  Framework did great in our battery influence test,
[3405.70 --> 3406.92]  both with and without the GPU.
[3407.36 --> 3408.82]  Hey, it's John from the lab!
[3409.16 --> 3409.36]  Yeah.
[3409.52 --> 3409.70]  Okay.
[3409.82 --> 3410.24]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3410.24 --> 3410.96]  That's really good.
[3411.06 --> 3411.32]  Yeah.
[3411.50 --> 3413.36]  Whoa, how to do so well here?
[3413.36 --> 3413.92]  Wow.
[3415.16 --> 3416.24]  Well, that's good.
[3416.62 --> 3418.32]  That's crazy, actually.
[3419.24 --> 3419.60]  Okay.
[3420.10 --> 3422.14]  Meeting Asus and Lenovo by a few hours.
[3422.56 --> 3423.42]  We must have stress test.
[3425.14 --> 3425.70]  Hey!
[3426.94 --> 3427.46]  Okay.
[3427.86 --> 3428.44]  We're doing good.
[3429.46 --> 3430.62]  Yeah, I mean, to be clear,
[3430.98 --> 3433.04]  like, those bars look a lot higher,
[3433.42 --> 3433.88]  you know,
[3434.26 --> 3435.04]  but, like,
[3435.24 --> 3438.54]  that's another 15 minutes on battery
[3438.54 --> 3441.02]  if you're running an intense game.
[3441.34 --> 3441.50]  Yeah.
[3441.62 --> 3442.28]  So don't, you know,
[3442.28 --> 3442.90]  don't, don't, don't,
[3442.90 --> 3443.94]  read too much into it.
[3444.42 --> 3445.28]  And if you rip out the GPU,
[3445.44 --> 3446.54]  you'll get even more battery life.
[3446.74 --> 3446.98]  However,
[3447.36 --> 3448.10]  none of these laptops
[3448.10 --> 3449.34]  are industry-leading for battery life,
[3449.52 --> 3450.68]  but if the battery in the framework
[3450.68 --> 3451.68]  starts to struggle after a few years,
[3451.76 --> 3452.82]  at least you can easily replace it.
[3453.38 --> 3454.32]  Was this a cold day?
[3455.22 --> 3455.88]  No, I don't think so.
[3455.88 --> 3457.10]  Two out of three hosts are wearing toques.
[3457.30 --> 3458.02]  Well, okay,
[3458.22 --> 3460.26]  there was some internal drama
[3460.26 --> 3462.82]  about a week and a half ago,
[3462.82 --> 3464.20]  about two weeks ago.
[3464.84 --> 3467.18]  Somebody adjusted the thermostat
[3467.18 --> 3469.68]  and Tech Dad was not impressed.
[3470.78 --> 3471.24]  That's me.
[3471.24 --> 3474.14]  Our thermostat in the warehouse over here,
[3474.20 --> 3475.40]  it's great in the winter
[3475.40 --> 3479.20]  because it uses air conditioning.
[3479.70 --> 3480.00]  Okay.
[3480.16 --> 3481.02]  In the summer,
[3481.34 --> 3483.02]  because we have an air conditioner
[3483.02 --> 3484.68]  and not a heat pump here,
[3485.24 --> 3487.34]  we use a radiant tube,
[3487.88 --> 3489.16]  so gas radiant heating.
[3489.54 --> 3491.68]  But because of the build-out
[3491.68 --> 3493.04]  that we did in the building,
[3493.32 --> 3494.84]  the original radiant tubes,
[3494.92 --> 3496.68]  of which there were a total of four
[3496.68 --> 3497.62]  in these four units,
[3497.62 --> 3499.26]  well, three of them are gone now.
[3499.72 --> 3499.94]  Oh.
[3500.16 --> 3501.48]  Because they don't fit anymore
[3501.48 --> 3502.48]  because they were longer
[3502.48 --> 3503.66]  than we have left in the building
[3503.66 --> 3505.78]  after we built mezzanine over that part.
[3506.28 --> 3506.58]  And like,
[3506.98 --> 3507.44]  I don't know,
[3507.46 --> 3508.50]  even if you could leave it there
[3508.50 --> 3509.04]  above the mezzanine,
[3509.10 --> 3509.40]  you wouldn't
[3509.40 --> 3510.40]  because it'd be a fire hazard
[3510.40 --> 3511.02]  because you have something
[3511.02 --> 3512.38]  right next to a radiant heating tube.
[3512.48 --> 3512.58]  Yeah.
[3512.72 --> 3514.22]  So we only have one,
[3514.32 --> 3517.40]  we only have one radiant heating tube
[3517.40 --> 3518.40]  in this warehouse
[3518.40 --> 3519.52]  and it's at the very end.
[3519.52 --> 3521.28]  Now,
[3521.76 --> 3523.22]  we have a fan.
[3523.98 --> 3525.04]  There's a fan
[3525.04 --> 3526.18]  that we spent like,
[3526.56 --> 3527.04]  it's from,
[3527.10 --> 3528.36]  it's from big ass fans.
[3528.62 --> 3531.08]  So it costs like a thousand dollars
[3531.08 --> 3532.14]  to buy this fan
[3532.14 --> 3532.98]  and install it.
[3533.90 --> 3535.08]  But the shooters
[3535.08 --> 3536.20]  never turn it on
[3536.20 --> 3537.64]  because it's kind of loud
[3537.64 --> 3538.50]  and it's inconvenient
[3538.50 --> 3539.58]  to turn it on and off,
[3539.62 --> 3540.76]  which I get,
[3540.92 --> 3541.44]  I hear you.
[3541.96 --> 3542.86]  But someone
[3542.86 --> 3545.10]  not knowing all of this.
[3545.14 --> 3546.28]  So what you're supposed to do
[3546.28 --> 3549.08]  is turn on the radiant tube
[3549.08 --> 3550.30]  and put on the fan
[3550.30 --> 3551.26]  so that it's not just
[3551.26 --> 3552.84]  boiling on one side
[3552.84 --> 3554.54]  and then cold on the other.
[3554.74 --> 3554.86]  Yeah.
[3555.26 --> 3556.62]  So what you're supposed to do
[3556.62 --> 3557.80]  is you're supposed to turn on the fan
[3557.80 --> 3559.86]  and not adjust the thermostat.
[3560.24 --> 3561.56]  So someone was like,
[3561.66 --> 3562.78]  I'm cold over here
[3562.78 --> 3564.44]  and adjusted the thermostat.
[3565.00 --> 3565.96]  So the warehouse
[3565.96 --> 3567.74]  was freaking,
[3567.98 --> 3568.62]  like,
[3569.66 --> 3570.62]  a freaking sauna
[3570.62 --> 3572.56]  while we were going through
[3572.56 --> 3573.48]  that cold snap.
[3574.48 --> 3574.84]  It's like,
[3575.74 --> 3576.68]  It was also cooking
[3576.68 --> 3577.36]  on the weekends.
[3577.58 --> 3577.94]  Guys.
[3578.12 --> 3578.80]  Did you figure that one out?
[3579.08 --> 3579.76]  I don't know.
[3579.80 --> 3580.52]  We'll figure that out later.
[3580.70 --> 3581.64]  But the point was like,
[3581.70 --> 3581.90]  guys,
[3582.00 --> 3582.26]  don't,
[3582.34 --> 3582.46]  please,
[3582.96 --> 3583.44]  don't,
[3583.52 --> 3585.10]  don't touch the thermostat.
[3585.22 --> 3585.34]  Look,
[3585.36 --> 3586.64]  I know it's not a perfect system,
[3586.76 --> 3587.02]  darn it,
[3587.08 --> 3588.52]  but just turn on the fan.
[3588.62 --> 3590.58]  Just put on the circulation fan.
[3591.38 --> 3592.08]  I think when you hit
[3592.08 --> 3593.02]  like late 20s,
[3593.04 --> 3593.76]  early 30s,
[3593.76 --> 3594.48]  you just start caring
[3594.48 --> 3595.48]  about thermostats a lot.
[3595.68 --> 3595.86]  Yeah.
[3595.94 --> 3597.46]  So logistics,
[3598.38 --> 3599.42]  locked,
[3599.64 --> 3600.40]  they put a lock
[3600.40 --> 3601.28]  on the thermostat.
[3601.72 --> 3602.82]  They took the key
[3602.82 --> 3603.76]  and they took it over
[3603.76 --> 3604.64]  to the other building
[3604.64 --> 3606.10]  because nobody's ever
[3606.10 --> 3607.20]  supposed to adjust it
[3607.20 --> 3608.56]  and it's possible
[3608.56 --> 3610.48]  that maybe they overcorrected
[3610.48 --> 3611.24]  and things were cold
[3611.24 --> 3611.72]  for a bit,
[3611.80 --> 3612.56]  but I think they've got it
[3612.56 --> 3613.16]  dialed in now.
[3613.42 --> 3613.76]  Got it.
[3613.80 --> 3614.08]  Okay.
[3614.74 --> 3615.12]  All right.
[3616.08 --> 3616.48]  So now,
[3616.64 --> 3617.56]  now you all know
[3617.56 --> 3619.18]  the saga of the,
[3619.18 --> 3619.50]  uh,
[3619.74 --> 3620.88]  the thermostat adjustment.
[3621.04 --> 3621.84]  Was it chilly that day?
[3621.84 --> 3622.36]  What it's like
[3622.36 --> 3623.36]  working behind the scenes.
[3623.46 --> 3623.74]  Maybe.
[3624.08 --> 3624.38]  Yeah.
[3624.38 --> 3625.94]  As for cooling,
[3626.28 --> 3626.76]  they partnered with
[3626.76 --> 3627.46]  Cooler Master Design
[3627.46 --> 3628.66]  as gigantic heat pipe array,
[3628.90 --> 3629.50]  which paired with
[3629.50 --> 3630.04]  the liquid metal
[3630.04 --> 3631.14]  resulted in combustor temps
[3631.14 --> 3632.50]  that absolutely crushed the...
[3632.50 --> 3634.16]  Oh.
[3634.54 --> 3634.96]  Whoa.
[3635.50 --> 3635.90]  Okay.
[3636.02 --> 3637.44]  So whatever complaints
[3637.44 --> 3639.08]  other media were seeing
[3639.08 --> 3640.56]  with the thermal solution,
[3640.72 --> 3641.76]  maybe that was an issue
[3641.76 --> 3642.74]  with their unit then.
[3642.94 --> 3643.30]  If you're having
[3643.30 --> 3644.10]  a hard time reading this,
[3644.32 --> 3646.94]  the red line is framework,
[3647.12 --> 3648.02]  blue line is ASUS,
[3648.12 --> 3649.02]  yellow line is Lenovo.
[3649.02 --> 3649.56]  So they,
[3649.94 --> 3650.16]  yeah,
[3650.36 --> 3651.16]  crushed I think
[3651.16 --> 3652.52]  is a pretty good word for that.
[3652.60 --> 3653.38]  That's awesome.
[3653.54 --> 3654.00]  That's very good.
[3654.00 --> 3655.02]  That's a great result.
[3655.38 --> 3656.16]  I will yet again,
[3656.22 --> 3656.80]  you already said it,
[3656.84 --> 3657.80]  I will yet again say
[3657.80 --> 3659.04]  it sounds like most,
[3659.16 --> 3659.68]  if not all,
[3659.70 --> 3660.74]  of the review units
[3660.74 --> 3662.26]  were pre-production.
[3663.88 --> 3665.04]  Maybe not wise.
[3665.78 --> 3666.14]  Yeah.
[3666.52 --> 3667.20]  Continuing on.
[3667.70 --> 3668.60]  A16 from ASUS,
[3668.66 --> 3669.04]  which is running
[3669.04 --> 3671.00]  the exact same RX 7700S.
[3671.24 --> 3672.64]  The framework did peak higher
[3672.64 --> 3674.00]  than the Lenovo's RTX 4070,
[3674.20 --> 3675.36]  but once the fans ramped up,
[3675.44 --> 3675.94]  it held its own.
[3676.18 --> 3677.12]  It's important to mention
[3677.12 --> 3677.92]  that the Lenovo unit
[3677.92 --> 3679.56]  was repasted with Noctua NTH1
[3679.56 --> 3680.36]  in a previous project,
[3680.54 --> 3681.38]  so it could be possible
[3681.38 --> 3681.80]  that the framework
[3681.80 --> 3682.74]  would look even better here
[3682.74 --> 3683.58]  to a factory Lenovo.
[3683.58 --> 3684.80]  Remember the F1 stress test?
[3684.96 --> 3685.66]  That framework performed
[3685.66 --> 3686.36]  exceptionally well,
[3686.46 --> 3687.30]  staying up to 65 degrees
[3687.30 --> 3687.62]  in the CPU,
[3687.76 --> 3688.28]  while the ASUS
[3688.28 --> 3689.10]  and the Lenovo
[3689.10 --> 3690.38]  are both hitting over 70
[3690.38 --> 3691.54]  or even 80 degrees.
[3692.04 --> 3693.06]  And that's while maintaining
[3693.06 --> 3694.42]  a very solid Lenovo.
[3694.72 --> 3696.08]  I think he's talking peaks there.
[3696.26 --> 3696.40]  Yeah,
[3696.42 --> 3697.22]  but what happened here?
[3698.02 --> 3699.48]  These both spike right here
[3699.48 --> 3700.52]  and this one spikes down.
[3700.52 --> 3702.10]  The F1 23 benchmark
[3702.10 --> 3705.04]  is not fully canned.
[3705.70 --> 3706.52]  It runs...
[3707.48 --> 3708.76]  It's dynamic.
[3709.28 --> 3709.90]  Okay, sorry.
[3710.04 --> 3710.66]  What's the best way
[3710.66 --> 3711.22]  for me to describe...
[3711.22 --> 3711.98]  It's not exactly
[3711.98 --> 3712.84]  the same every time.
[3712.92 --> 3713.10]  Yeah.
[3713.36 --> 3714.72]  Like, all the AI is running.
[3714.86 --> 3716.00]  All the physics is running.
[3716.14 --> 3716.30]  Yeah.
[3716.44 --> 3718.40]  So sometimes you can just have...
[3718.40 --> 3719.16]  Something slightly different
[3719.16 --> 3719.68]  is going to happen.
[3719.88 --> 3720.50]  Something happens
[3720.50 --> 3721.06]  slightly different.
[3721.18 --> 3722.24]  You should just be kind of
[3722.24 --> 3723.40]  looking at overall
[3723.40 --> 3724.24]  how it goes.
[3724.24 --> 3724.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[3724.60 --> 3726.38]  are both hitting over 70
[3726.38 --> 3727.46]  or even 80 degrees.
[3728.02 --> 3729.04]  And that's while maintaining
[3729.04 --> 3730.66]  a very solid 4.1 gigahertz
[3730.66 --> 3731.64]  on the average clock speed.
[3731.74 --> 3732.06]  Whoa.
[3732.06 --> 3732.58]  While the A16
[3732.58 --> 3734.14]  averaged closer to 2.7.
[3734.34 --> 3734.70]  Yikes.
[3734.90 --> 3735.46]  To be fair,
[3735.56 --> 3736.26]  we ran all these laptops
[3736.26 --> 3736.80]  in their default
[3736.80 --> 3737.52]  power configurations.
[3737.80 --> 3738.94]  But the tough A16's
[3738.94 --> 3739.84]  Radeon 7700S
[3739.84 --> 3740.86]  is reporting 80 degrees
[3740.86 --> 3741.56]  average on the core
[3741.56 --> 3742.68]  and 93 on the hotspot.
[3743.04 --> 3743.54]  The framework
[3743.54 --> 3744.78]  kept to a much more reasonable
[3744.78 --> 3746.20]  68 and 80 degrees respectively.
[3746.80 --> 3747.56]  The webcam and microphone
[3747.56 --> 3748.52]  which use the same module
[3748.52 --> 3749.18]  as the framework 13.
[3749.48 --> 3749.92]  Very cool.
[3750.06 --> 3750.98]  Look and sound like this.
[3750.98 --> 3751.44]  Oh, okay.
[3751.44 --> 3751.88]  At least with a...
[3751.88 --> 3752.54]  I was going to say
[3752.54 --> 3753.32]  that was a big
[3753.32 --> 3754.34]  audio quality change.
[3754.34 --> 3754.70]  Yeah, I know.
[3754.76 --> 3755.28]  We got this.
[3755.44 --> 3756.30]  We got this, bro.
[3756.64 --> 3757.60]  Big studio light in front of me.
[3757.84 --> 3758.48]  And if you shut it off,
[3759.26 --> 3759.64]  like this
[3759.64 --> 3760.98]  in a pretty dimly crappy environment.
[3761.20 --> 3761.50]  Not great.
[3761.78 --> 3762.26]  Not terrible.
[3762.40 --> 3763.36]  And I did anecdotally hear
[3763.36 --> 3764.02]  that the microphone
[3764.02 --> 3764.62]  sounded better
[3764.62 --> 3765.58]  than my AirPods Pro too.
[3765.82 --> 3766.30]  So, cool.
[3766.52 --> 3766.94]  And they do at least
[3766.94 --> 3767.68]  have physical shutoff switches
[3767.68 --> 3768.28]  which is a nice touch.
[3768.64 --> 3769.20]  And we haven't even talked
[3769.20 --> 3769.86]  about the display.
[3770.14 --> 3771.08]  The framework 16 holds its own
[3771.08 --> 3772.00]  when it comes to color accuracy
[3772.00 --> 3772.70]  reaching an average
[3772.70 --> 3774.00]  SDR Delta E of 1.5
[3774.00 --> 3774.86]  and a max of 2.8
[3774.86 --> 3775.30]  That's pretty good.
[3775.30 --> 3775.68]  In part thanks to
[3775.68 --> 3776.84]  Windows Auto Color Management System
[3776.84 --> 3777.60]  which only seems to support
[3777.60 --> 3778.44]  a few selected displays.
[3778.74 --> 3779.52]  It shifts with it turned off
[3779.52 --> 3780.44]  making the numbers much worse
[3780.44 --> 3781.52]  so we recommend using it.
[3781.76 --> 3782.36]  The display is bright enough
[3782.36 --> 3782.72]  for outdoors
[3782.72 --> 3783.66]  over 500 nits.
[3783.80 --> 3784.88]  Motion clarity is decent enough
[3784.88 --> 3785.68]  at 165 hertz
[3785.68 --> 3786.28]  which is great for gaming.
[3786.46 --> 3788.44]  But there are a couple of issues
[3788.44 --> 3789.46]  that are a bit hard to ignore.
[3789.72 --> 3790.36]  Like the honestly
[3790.36 --> 3791.68]  kind of mid uniformity
[3791.68 --> 3792.74]  that results in visible vignette
[3792.74 --> 3793.42]  on webpages
[3793.42 --> 3794.14]  and solid backgrounds.
[3794.44 --> 3795.42]  And somehow our unit's panel
[3795.42 --> 3796.04]  was painted under
[3796.04 --> 3796.90]  the removable plastic bezel
[3796.90 --> 3797.34]  for some reason.
[3797.70 --> 3798.28]  It kind of looks like
[3798.28 --> 3798.76]  you could move it around.
[3798.76 --> 3799.12]  I've seen that happen
[3799.12 --> 3799.82]  a decent amount.
[3800.08 --> 3800.96]  This leads me to the price.
[3801.40 --> 3801.98]  As configured
[3801.98 --> 3803.06]  ignoring extra accessories
[3803.06 --> 3804.00]  like the expansion shell
[3804.00 --> 3804.76]  which isn't included
[3804.76 --> 3805.40]  if you spec a GPU
[3805.40 --> 3806.94]  and cost $100 on its own.
[3807.26 --> 3808.74]  This is a $2,200 laptop.
[3809.00 --> 3809.68]  They're not gouging.
[3809.68 --> 3810.88]  Remember, it's a small company
[3810.88 --> 3812.62]  building an entirely bespoke laptop
[3812.62 --> 3813.76]  that genuinely could
[3813.76 --> 3814.82]  and seems to already be
[3814.82 --> 3816.04]  changing an entire industry.
[3816.44 --> 3817.06]  Yeah, and they have to pay
[3817.06 --> 3817.88]  their graphic designers
[3817.88 --> 3819.04]  to draw those little portraits
[3819.04 --> 3819.58]  of everybody.
[3819.98 --> 3820.12]  Yeah.
[3820.18 --> 3820.66]  That's not free.
[3821.10 --> 3821.32]  Yeah.
[3823.26 --> 3823.66]  Yeah.
[3824.34 --> 3825.26]  The keyboard stability
[3825.26 --> 3826.12]  and display uniformity
[3826.12 --> 3827.00]  are things that would normally
[3827.00 --> 3827.76]  be a deal breaker for me.
[3827.96 --> 3828.86]  Especially at this price point
[3828.86 --> 3829.56]  and I wouldn't blame you
[3829.56 --> 3829.90]  for feeling...
[3829.90 --> 3831.00]  They should have an on-site
[3831.00 --> 3832.14]  dog sitter.
[3833.28 --> 3834.60]  Okay, that's an inside joke
[3834.60 --> 3835.50]  people are not going to get.
[3835.98 --> 3836.14]  Same.
[3836.48 --> 3837.18]  But here's the thing.
[3837.52 --> 3838.08]  Fixing the keyboard
[3838.08 --> 3839.36]  is probably something you can DIY.
[3839.68 --> 3840.22]  Alex showed earlier
[3840.22 --> 3840.92]  and assuming Framework
[3840.92 --> 3841.74]  either fixes the issues
[3841.74 --> 3843.00]  or comes up with a panel upgrade
[3843.00 --> 3843.40]  down the road,
[3843.68 --> 3844.52]  I can probably live with
[3844.52 --> 3845.14]  that display for a while.
[3845.42 --> 3846.64]  For the utter flexibility,
[3846.96 --> 3847.48]  repairability,
[3847.70 --> 3848.36]  and the simple fact
[3848.36 --> 3849.58]  that this could be theoretically
[3849.58 --> 3850.78]  the last gaming laptop
[3850.78 --> 3851.70]  I'd ever need to buy.
[3852.04 --> 3853.20]  That's pretty freaking cool.
[3853.38 --> 3854.04]  So as long as Framework
[3854.04 --> 3854.62]  stays in business
[3854.62 --> 3855.12]  and follows through
[3855.12 --> 3855.54]  with their promises,
[3855.70 --> 3856.48]  I mean, they already have
[3856.48 --> 3857.56]  a history of doing so.
[3858.00 --> 3858.94]  When the CPU is too outdated
[3858.94 --> 3860.06]  or the GPU isn't strong enough
[3860.06 --> 3860.64]  Yeah, that's actually
[3860.64 --> 3861.72]  a really good point.
[3861.72 --> 3864.72]  If these guys came out of nowhere
[3864.72 --> 3866.56]  and went straight at
[3866.56 --> 3868.02]  we're doing a gaming laptop
[3868.02 --> 3868.56]  That would have been
[3868.56 --> 3869.06]  the wrong move.
[3869.26 --> 3870.92]  I wouldn't believe them.
[3871.26 --> 3872.62]  There's absolutely no way.
[3872.70 --> 3874.28]  The only thing that gives this
[3874.28 --> 3875.38]  any credibility
[3875.38 --> 3877.22]  is the fact that they've already
[3877.22 --> 3878.40]  Oh, I was about to
[3878.40 --> 3879.00]  Okay, sorry.
[3879.00 --> 3885.12]  Hold on.
[3885.68 --> 3886.74]  Is the fact that they've
[3886.74 --> 3887.88]  already delivered
[3887.88 --> 3889.90]  multiple generations of upgrades
[3889.90 --> 3891.40]  on the Framework 13.
[3893.18 --> 3894.64]  So as far as I'm concerned,
[3895.06 --> 3896.62]  I believe them until
[3896.62 --> 3897.98]  they screw it up now.
[3898.10 --> 3898.22]  Yeah.
[3898.32 --> 3899.04]  As opposed to
[3899.04 --> 3900.44]  my default state
[3900.44 --> 3900.88]  would have been
[3900.88 --> 3901.22]  You have to prove yourself.
[3901.40 --> 3902.30]  not believing them
[3902.30 --> 3903.00]  until they actually
[3903.00 --> 3903.88]  do something before.
[3904.04 --> 3904.18]  Yeah.
[3904.94 --> 3906.54]  Precedent is good right now.
[3906.90 --> 3907.64]  Ford gets gunked up
[3907.64 --> 3908.28]  and the battery dies.
[3908.28 --> 3909.16]  It's an easy spot.
[3909.42 --> 3910.20]  Instead of chucking away
[3910.20 --> 3910.98]  an entire machine,
[3911.22 --> 3911.96]  you can have your very own
[3911.96 --> 3912.64]  laptop of Theseus
[3912.64 --> 3913.52]  and I can't wait to see
[3913.52 --> 3914.00]  what the future holds.
[3914.10 --> 3914.88]  All that's left is to decide
[3914.88 --> 3915.72]  if I want to keep my pre-order.
[3916.02 --> 3916.98]  But think of the modules, Jamie.
[3917.22 --> 3917.54]  Right.
[3917.98 --> 3918.80]  And maybe they can make a module
[3918.80 --> 3919.44]  that would help me segue
[3919.44 --> 3920.52]  to our sponsor.
[3920.76 --> 3921.04]  Jawa.
[3921.24 --> 3921.90]  We've all been there
[3921.90 --> 3922.56]  trying to sell stuff
[3922.56 --> 3923.26]  the usual way.
[3923.68 --> 3924.42]  That was pretty good.
[3924.46 --> 3925.54]  I've taught them well.
[3925.80 --> 3925.98]  Yeah.
[3926.38 --> 3927.12]  That was pretty good.
[3927.42 --> 3928.24]  That was a good video.
[3928.88 --> 3930.04]  That was really good.
[3930.26 --> 3931.98]  It's almost like we have a style
[3931.98 --> 3933.42]  and we have a really good team
[3933.42 --> 3934.84]  and stuff.
[3936.30 --> 3937.12]  Yeah, that was
[3937.12 --> 3937.62]  that was
[3937.62 --> 3938.74]  that was an awesome video.
[3938.82 --> 3939.64]  I really liked switching
[3939.64 --> 3940.70]  between the different hosts,
[3940.82 --> 3941.32]  kind of getting the
[3941.32 --> 3942.02]  different perspectives.
[3942.62 --> 3943.68]  Great job, everyone.
[3944.16 --> 3944.92]  Like, great job.
[3945.16 --> 3945.94]  Yeah, it was really good.
[3946.02 --> 3946.80]  Really enjoyed that.
[3948.20 --> 3949.72]  Yeah, first camera appearance
[3949.72 --> 3950.16]  as well.
[3950.34 --> 3950.94]  Super good.
[3951.08 --> 3951.40]  Oh, yeah.
[3951.44 --> 3951.96]  John did great.
[3952.08 --> 3952.56]  That was great.
[3952.72 --> 3952.88]  Yep.
[3953.40 --> 3954.02]  I think it's
[3954.02 --> 3954.68]  I think it was
[3954.68 --> 3955.64]  the right call
[3955.64 --> 3956.50]  to just keep it
[3956.50 --> 3957.38]  for a short period
[3957.38 --> 3958.70]  because I think that
[3958.70 --> 3960.24]  while he did a great job,
[3960.26 --> 3961.90]  it can be hard to do like
[3961.90 --> 3962.50]  I wasn't there
[3962.50 --> 3963.16]  when they were shooting it,
[3963.22 --> 3963.92]  but it can be hard
[3963.92 --> 3965.28]  to do like long takes,
[3965.38 --> 3965.88]  which can make it
[3965.88 --> 3966.38]  a lot more work
[3966.38 --> 3967.34]  for the editor and stuff.
[3967.50 --> 3967.62]  Yeah.
[3968.40 --> 3969.90]  And it's nice to ease
[3969.90 --> 3970.74]  people into it,
[3970.84 --> 3970.98]  you know,
[3971.02 --> 3971.96]  get people kind of used
[3971.96 --> 3972.68]  to them as well.
[3972.92 --> 3974.90]  I also really personally
[3974.90 --> 3975.64]  You did a good job.
[3975.72 --> 3977.14]  As a personal opinion
[3977.14 --> 3978.14]  flavor thing,
[3978.40 --> 3981.04]  I like expert in a thing
[3981.04 --> 3982.30]  presenting their section
[3982.30 --> 3982.94]  of a thing.
[3983.16 --> 3984.26]  I've always really liked that.
[3984.30 --> 3984.98]  Whether they're the best
[3984.98 --> 3985.92]  presenter or not,
[3986.08 --> 3987.04]  you can get away
[3987.04 --> 3990.20]  with almost any level of host.
[3990.78 --> 3991.18]  Yeah.
[3991.30 --> 3992.22]  As long as they're not
[3992.22 --> 3993.26]  on camera for too long.
[3993.84 --> 3994.06]  Yeah.
[3994.28 --> 3994.96]  So that's something
[3994.96 --> 3996.00]  that we've used a lot
[3996.00 --> 3997.18]  when we've done factory tours,
[3997.26 --> 3997.70]  for example.
[3997.98 --> 3998.16]  Yeah.
[3998.50 --> 4000.20]  Like when I did the Intel tours,
[4000.40 --> 4002.02]  I recognized pretty quickly
[4002.02 --> 4003.70]  that these were not folks
[4003.70 --> 4004.84]  that I could give
[4004.84 --> 4006.80]  like a 200 word spiel to.
[4008.56 --> 4009.78]  But I can do a little thing.
[4009.96 --> 4011.20]  But if I gave them
[4011.20 --> 4012.46]  exactly the intonation
[4012.46 --> 4012.96]  I wanted,
[4013.12 --> 4014.12]  gave them the eyeline
[4014.12 --> 4015.40]  and gave them like
[4015.40 --> 4016.34]  like 10 words
[4016.34 --> 4017.30]  or something like that,
[4017.46 --> 4018.58]  then I could get them
[4018.58 --> 4019.22]  in the video.
[4019.74 --> 4021.06]  They could do a great job.
[4021.14 --> 4021.56]  They could put
[4021.56 --> 4022.56]  their best foot forward
[4022.56 --> 4024.42]  and then people could hear it
[4024.42 --> 4025.94]  right from the experts
[4025.94 --> 4027.98]  and we get that balance
[4027.98 --> 4029.50]  where I do my thing,
[4029.80 --> 4030.94]  which is to be a host,
[4031.36 --> 4032.72]  and they get to do their thing,
[4033.04 --> 4035.38]  which is to be an expert.
[4035.86 --> 4037.52]  And it enhances the video
[4037.52 --> 4039.16]  by putting those elements together,
[4039.24 --> 4039.38]  right?
[4039.40 --> 4040.60]  And I think that the team
[4040.60 --> 4041.88]  did a great job
[4041.88 --> 4043.44]  of doing that.
[4044.06 --> 4045.14]  Really good video.
[4045.14 --> 4047.34]  There's an official post
[4047.34 --> 4048.32]  from Framework
[4048.32 --> 4049.18]  on Framework's
[4049.18 --> 4050.36]  community page.
[4050.52 --> 4051.50]  Oh, can I give you
[4051.50 --> 4051.74]  a laptop?
[4052.02 --> 4052.50]  Sure.
[4052.96 --> 4055.48]  It's really long.
[4055.64 --> 4056.36]  Oh, wow.
[4058.76 --> 4059.82]  But they address
[4059.82 --> 4060.82]  a bunch of stuff.
[4062.14 --> 4063.38]  High frequency noise
[4063.38 --> 4064.48]  from the main board,
[4064.98 --> 4065.84]  buzzing noise
[4065.84 --> 4067.02]  from graphics module,
[4067.22 --> 4069.08]  CPU thermal module performance,
[4069.36 --> 4071.08]  liquid metal barrier adjustments,
[4071.48 --> 4072.82]  cold GPU performance,
[4072.82 --> 4075.34]  DPC watchdog violation,
[4075.48 --> 4076.00]  blue screen,
[4076.18 --> 4077.20]  speecher attenuated
[4077.20 --> 4078.20]  on the left
[4078.20 --> 4079.18]  or right channel,
[4080.02 --> 4081.00]  touchpad module,
[4081.22 --> 4082.08]  sliding friction,
[4082.30 --> 4083.04]  display alignment,
[4083.26 --> 4084.26]  display color gamut,
[4084.66 --> 4085.56]  minor fix and finish
[4085.56 --> 4086.44]  input modules,
[4086.84 --> 4087.50]  keyboard detection,
[4087.84 --> 4089.26]  secondary SSD may disappear,
[4089.62 --> 4090.30]  display frozen
[4090.30 --> 4092.24]  after smart mux switching,
[4093.28 --> 4093.82]  and they're...
[4094.84 --> 4095.26]  Yeah.
[4095.70 --> 4096.84]  So maybe if you're interested,
[4096.98 --> 4097.50]  go read that.
[4098.46 --> 4099.26]  So what you're trying to say
[4099.26 --> 4099.96]  is they're on it
[4099.96 --> 4100.54]  like a bonnet.
[4100.54 --> 4106.68]  Very, very good circle.
[4106.98 --> 4107.58]  Yeah, thank you.
[4107.80 --> 4108.12]  Fantastic.
[4108.32 --> 4108.66]  Thank you.
[4109.00 --> 4110.22]  There's a channel super fun
[4110.22 --> 4110.88]  how to draw a circle.
[4110.98 --> 4111.60]  I watched it now.
[4111.68 --> 4111.82]  I know.
[4113.20 --> 4113.94]  Very popular.
[4114.40 --> 4114.98]  Was it?
[4115.28 --> 4116.02]  That's a short, yeah.
[4116.08 --> 4117.26]  It has like 100 million views
[4117.26 --> 4117.50]  or something.
[4118.34 --> 4118.70]  Wow.
[4119.84 --> 4121.46]  Our most successful video ever
[4121.46 --> 4122.26]  and it's just like...
[4122.26 --> 4123.10]  Can anyone at the company
[4123.10 --> 4123.82]  do a backflip?
[4124.38 --> 4124.72]  Yes.
[4125.16 --> 4125.74]  We should do
[4125.74 --> 4126.60]  how to do a backflip.
[4126.64 --> 4127.42]  No, we shouldn't.
[4127.54 --> 4127.80]  Why?
[4127.94 --> 4128.82]  Because you know who it is?
[4129.54 --> 4129.78]  Who?
[4130.14 --> 4130.50]  Elijah.
[4134.80 --> 4135.16]  What?
[4135.60 --> 4137.02]  We should definitely do it now.
[4137.36 --> 4138.14]  We really shouldn't.
[4140.20 --> 4141.14]  Elijah, there you go.
[4141.30 --> 4141.76]  There you go.
[4141.98 --> 4143.12]  Revive channel super fun
[4143.12 --> 4143.90]  by yourself.
[4144.30 --> 4145.38]  One short video
[4145.38 --> 4146.46]  how to do a backflip.
[4146.54 --> 4147.02]  Not even a little.
[4147.02 --> 4147.74]  No other content.
[4148.02 --> 4149.00]  No mainline videos.
[4149.02 --> 4149.68]  Not even once.
[4149.76 --> 4150.54]  None of that kind of stuff.
[4150.64 --> 4151.10]  Yeah, how to draw
[4151.10 --> 4151.74]  a perfect circle
[4151.74 --> 4153.44]  107 million views.
[4153.64 --> 4153.94]  Wow.
[4155.06 --> 4155.64]  That's crazy.
[4155.64 --> 4155.84]  That's crazy.
[4155.84 --> 4159.46]  If he screws up
[4159.46 --> 4160.22]  doing a backflip
[4160.22 --> 4160.88]  on work,
[4160.90 --> 4161.74]  on work property
[4161.74 --> 4162.78]  and hits his head again,
[4163.24 --> 4163.86]  what happens?
[4164.22 --> 4164.78]  We're liable.
[4165.34 --> 4166.50]  That's why he will never
[4166.50 --> 4167.12]  do a backflip
[4167.12 --> 4167.84]  on work property.
[4168.02 --> 4168.20]  Elijah, if you're watching...
[4168.20 --> 4169.04]  Let's not do that.
[4169.04 --> 4170.88]  No.
[4171.12 --> 4171.82]  What if you go to
[4171.82 --> 4172.98]  a trampoline place,
[4173.04 --> 4174.84]  like a gymnastics place
[4174.84 --> 4175.40]  with a foam pit
[4175.40 --> 4175.96]  and he backflips
[4175.96 --> 4176.62]  into a foam pit?
[4177.12 --> 4177.66]  Is he working?
[4178.28 --> 4178.52]  Yeah.
[4178.90 --> 4179.12]  No.
[4179.56 --> 4179.96]  Okay.
[4180.80 --> 4181.14]  Forbidden.
[4181.80 --> 4182.32]  All right.
[4182.32 --> 4184.20]  Can anyone else
[4184.20 --> 4184.88]  do a backflip?
[4185.02 --> 4185.46]  It doesn't matter.
[4185.50 --> 4186.30]  Can you do a backflip?
[4186.40 --> 4187.00]  On a trampoline?
[4187.06 --> 4187.18]  Yeah.
[4187.40 --> 4187.72]  Okay.
[4189.44 --> 4190.08]  In fact,
[4190.18 --> 4191.38]  I think there's a...
[4191.38 --> 4192.90]  I think Yvonne
[4192.90 --> 4193.86]  uploaded a video
[4193.86 --> 4194.86]  of me attempting one
[4194.86 --> 4195.40]  at some point
[4195.40 --> 4195.82]  on Twitter.
[4196.30 --> 4196.54]  Oh.
[4196.86 --> 4198.14]  And I...
[4198.14 --> 4198.90]  It seemed like
[4198.90 --> 4199.40]  something you might
[4199.40 --> 4199.84]  be able to do.
[4200.22 --> 4201.18]  I like...
[4201.18 --> 4201.74]  You know how
[4201.74 --> 4202.38]  our trampoline
[4202.38 --> 4203.86]  has the net around it?
[4204.04 --> 4205.18]  I like hit the net
[4205.18 --> 4205.96]  because I...
[4205.96 --> 4207.18]  Like I almost backflipped
[4207.18 --> 4208.42]  right out of the trampoline
[4208.42 --> 4209.26]  because it had been
[4209.26 --> 4209.84]  a long time
[4209.84 --> 4211.06]  and I jumped
[4211.06 --> 4212.08]  back
[4212.08 --> 4213.94]  instead of jumping up.
[4215.06 --> 4215.46]  Anyway.
[4217.34 --> 4217.98]  Oh boy.
[4219.18 --> 4219.58]  No.
[4221.02 --> 4221.42]  Okay.
[4221.50 --> 4222.30]  What else are we talking about?
[4222.44 --> 4222.60]  Oh.
[4223.16 --> 4223.88]  Merch messages.
[4224.16 --> 4224.38]  Yeah.
[4225.00 --> 4225.38]  Guys,
[4225.50 --> 4226.60]  the way to interact
[4226.60 --> 4227.10]  with the show
[4227.10 --> 4227.74]  Good Gravy.
[4227.84 --> 4228.80]  We are an hour and a half in.
[4228.86 --> 4229.36]  We haven't even done
[4229.36 --> 4230.14]  merch messages yet.
[4230.74 --> 4231.00]  Luke,
[4231.12 --> 4231.84]  how could you allow
[4231.84 --> 4232.44]  this to happen?
[4232.88 --> 4233.88]  It was my plan
[4233.88 --> 4234.68]  all along actually.
[4235.18 --> 4236.24]  I came in today
[4236.24 --> 4236.60]  and I was like,
[4236.64 --> 4236.92]  you know what?
[4236.92 --> 4238.00]  We need to get 90 minutes
[4238.00 --> 4238.46]  into the show
[4238.46 --> 4239.18]  before we do merch messages.
[4239.18 --> 4239.90]  I wanted to get home
[4239.90 --> 4240.98]  at a reasonable time today.
[4241.14 --> 4241.60]  Way to go.
[4241.96 --> 4242.16]  No.
[4243.06 --> 4243.88]  Not gonna happen.
[4243.94 --> 4244.58]  The way to interact
[4244.58 --> 4244.98]  with the show
[4244.98 --> 4245.90]  is merch messages.
[4246.10 --> 4247.06]  Don't send a super chat.
[4247.16 --> 4248.00]  Don't send Twitch bits.
[4248.10 --> 4249.06]  Send a merch message.
[4249.16 --> 4249.62]  All you gotta do
[4249.62 --> 4250.76]  is go on lttstore.com
[4250.76 --> 4252.48]  find some awesome stuff
[4252.48 --> 4253.14]  to check out.
[4254.26 --> 4255.04]  First warning,
[4255.62 --> 4256.52]  there will be at least
[4256.52 --> 4257.44]  several more
[4257.44 --> 4259.46]  but screwdriver bit prices
[4259.46 --> 4261.06]  are going to be going up.
[4262.06 --> 4262.90]  Taren came in
[4262.90 --> 4264.42]  and he knows how to do
[4264.42 --> 4265.34]  proper math
[4265.34 --> 4267.22]  for your operational expenses
[4267.22 --> 4269.08]  and we are losing money
[4269.08 --> 4269.90]  on screwdriver bits.
[4270.16 --> 4270.42]  Oh.
[4270.74 --> 4271.14]  Basically.
[4271.40 --> 4271.92]  That's not good.
[4272.00 --> 4272.70]  Once you account
[4272.70 --> 4273.72]  for all the handling
[4273.72 --> 4275.24]  and everything
[4275.24 --> 4275.86]  and overhead,
[4276.32 --> 4278.26]  they are not profitable
[4278.26 --> 4279.40]  at $6.99
[4279.40 --> 4281.60]  for the big packs of them.
[4282.18 --> 4284.00]  I heard in school
[4284.00 --> 4284.84]  that that's bad.
[4285.12 --> 4285.44]  Yeah.
[4285.94 --> 4286.74]  No, you didn't.
[4287.18 --> 4288.34]  You never took that class.
[4289.06 --> 4290.12]  The point is
[4290.12 --> 4291.56]  pricing will be going up
[4291.56 --> 4292.94]  so if you see bits
[4292.94 --> 4293.56]  that you like
[4293.56 --> 4294.36]  and they're in stock,
[4294.52 --> 4295.54]  pick them up.
[4295.94 --> 4297.48]  We are going to make sure
[4297.48 --> 4298.68]  everyone gets ample warning.
[4298.86 --> 4299.46]  I told the guys,
[4299.54 --> 4299.80]  I was like,
[4299.86 --> 4300.04]  look,
[4302.56 --> 4303.44]  we don't want these.
[4303.94 --> 4305.34]  You don't want to drop it on people.
[4305.46 --> 4306.72]  No, we don't want to drop it on people
[4306.72 --> 4307.92]  and we don't want to go any higher
[4307.92 --> 4308.52]  than we have to
[4308.52 --> 4308.98]  to make sure
[4308.98 --> 4309.82]  that we're above water
[4309.82 --> 4310.46]  on this thing.
[4310.88 --> 4312.24]  They're really high quality bits
[4312.24 --> 4313.46]  but guys,
[4313.54 --> 4314.06]  we don't want people
[4314.06 --> 4314.92]  to feel like,
[4314.98 --> 4315.90]  you know,
[4316.42 --> 4317.48]  we're trying to adopt
[4317.48 --> 4318.22]  the printer model.
[4318.68 --> 4318.90]  Yeah.
[4319.20 --> 4319.64]  You know?
[4319.84 --> 4320.00]  Yeah.
[4320.54 --> 4322.06]  That's not the intent here
[4322.06 --> 4324.30]  but so there's going to be
[4324.30 --> 4324.82]  a newsletter.
[4325.48 --> 4326.20]  We're going to,
[4326.20 --> 4327.50]  we're going to talk about it.
[4327.56 --> 4328.12]  I think it's probably
[4328.12 --> 4328.60]  not going to happen
[4328.60 --> 4329.68]  for a couple of months
[4329.68 --> 4330.88]  but yeah,
[4330.96 --> 4331.48]  pick up some,
[4331.58 --> 4332.16]  pick up some bits
[4332.16 --> 4332.70]  if you want
[4332.70 --> 4333.08]  as a,
[4333.08 --> 4333.78]  as a merch message.
[4333.98 --> 4334.34]  Oh,
[4334.38 --> 4334.86]  what now?
[4336.12 --> 4336.48]  What?
[4336.88 --> 4337.50]  Wait for it.
[4337.50 --> 4337.92]  What now?
[4338.44 --> 4338.92]  Wait for it.
[4339.06 --> 4339.70]  What is it?
[4340.02 --> 4340.22]  Oh,
[4340.28 --> 4340.54]  this.
[4341.08 --> 4341.44]  Okay.
[4341.58 --> 4341.84]  Yes.
[4343.30 --> 4343.74]  Oh,
[4343.90 --> 4344.72]  that was pretty close.
[4350.88 --> 4352.28]  We're happy that net's there.
[4352.38 --> 4353.10]  So I didn't tuck.
[4353.42 --> 4353.98]  We're also happy
[4353.98 --> 4354.70]  you didn't go higher.
[4354.88 --> 4355.10]  Yeah.
[4356.90 --> 4358.36]  Your feet are like
[4358.36 --> 4359.66]  right at the rim
[4359.66 --> 4360.14]  of that net.
[4360.24 --> 4360.36]  Oh,
[4360.38 --> 4360.58]  I know.
[4361.52 --> 4361.88]  Yep.
[4362.28 --> 4362.94]  I caught that
[4362.94 --> 4363.76]  on the security camera.
[4364.66 --> 4365.08]  People are saying
[4365.08 --> 4365.58]  scroll down
[4365.58 --> 4366.26]  but I'm not signed in
[4366.26 --> 4366.56]  on Twitter
[4366.56 --> 4367.40]  so there's nothing there.
[4369.20 --> 4369.56]  Nice.
[4369.80 --> 4370.32]  There's nothing
[4370.32 --> 4371.16]  to scroll down to.
[4374.32 --> 4374.68]  Yeah.
[4375.08 --> 4375.44]  So,
[4375.58 --> 4376.26]  what was I talking about?
[4376.34 --> 4376.54]  Oh,
[4376.58 --> 4376.86]  I see.
[4376.96 --> 4377.10]  Right.
[4377.22 --> 4377.82]  Bits are going up.
[4377.82 --> 4378.06]  So,
[4378.18 --> 4378.76]  all you got to do
[4378.76 --> 4379.78]  is add something
[4379.78 --> 4380.70]  to your cart
[4380.70 --> 4381.80]  and you'll see a little box
[4381.80 --> 4382.90]  for a merch message.
[4382.98 --> 4384.04]  It'll go to our producer Dan.
[4384.20 --> 4384.44]  Hey,
[4384.50 --> 4384.92]  there he is.
[4386.92 --> 4387.32]  Dan,
[4387.64 --> 4387.94]  really?
[4388.30 --> 4388.64]  You're going to be
[4388.64 --> 4389.14]  in your underwear
[4389.14 --> 4389.84]  for the WAN show?
[4391.18 --> 4391.88]  I'm at home.
[4392.98 --> 4393.48]  That's fair.
[4394.24 --> 4394.58]  So,
[4394.66 --> 4395.46]  it'll go to producer Dan.
[4395.52 --> 4396.02]  He'll forward it
[4396.02 --> 4396.76]  to someone who can answer
[4396.76 --> 4397.18]  your question.
[4397.38 --> 4398.24]  He'll answer it himself
[4398.24 --> 4399.40]  or he will send it
[4399.40 --> 4400.26]  to me and Luke
[4400.26 --> 4401.52]  to reply to.
[4402.04 --> 4404.10]  The main highlight items
[4404.10 --> 4405.30]  for the store this week
[4405.30 --> 4407.38]  are the Steve Turtleneck
[4407.38 --> 4409.06]  which we launched last week.
[4409.84 --> 4410.04]  Oh,
[4410.12 --> 4411.18]  there's some interesting stuff.
[4411.26 --> 4411.38]  Okay,
[4411.38 --> 4412.10]  we'll talk about that later.
[4412.32 --> 4413.00]  What was that?
[4413.14 --> 4413.86]  Don't worry about it.
[4413.88 --> 4414.18]  What was that?
[4414.32 --> 4414.68]  Don't worry about it.
[4414.74 --> 4416.40]  Don't look at that.
[4416.46 --> 4416.88]  Don't look at that.
[4416.94 --> 4417.38]  Don't look at that.
[4417.68 --> 4418.02]  So,
[4418.12 --> 4419.16]  the Steve Turtleneck
[4419.16 --> 4420.52]  this just launched last week.
[4420.60 --> 4422.40]  This has been extremely popular.
[4422.96 --> 4424.70]  It's got the seam up the middle
[4424.70 --> 4426.64]  just like the classic one
[4426.64 --> 4427.66]  that some guy
[4427.66 --> 4429.26]  who's known in the tech space
[4429.26 --> 4430.00]  used to wear.
[4430.42 --> 4431.22]  It's a mock neck
[4431.22 --> 4432.44]  so it's not a super high turtleneck.
[4432.52 --> 4433.64]  It's very wearable.
[4434.06 --> 4435.16]  It's somewhere in between
[4435.16 --> 4435.92]  you know,
[4436.08 --> 4436.40]  business
[4436.40 --> 4437.60]  and just you can wear it
[4437.60 --> 4438.26]  anytime you want.
[4441.20 --> 4441.60]  Anyway,
[4442.96 --> 4443.84]  we just launched that
[4443.84 --> 4445.10]  and then we also
[4445.10 --> 4447.16]  have a brand new
[4447.16 --> 4448.68]  newly launched item.
[4449.04 --> 4450.76]  The women's PJ set
[4450.76 --> 4453.22]  which our delightful staff
[4453.22 --> 4454.20]  helped us model.
[4454.46 --> 4456.16]  Thank you so much everyone
[4456.16 --> 4457.16]  for helping out.
[4457.36 --> 4457.64]  One of those.
[4457.64 --> 4462.44]  They have too much fun
[4462.44 --> 4463.34]  in these shoots.
[4463.84 --> 4464.58]  To be clear,
[4464.68 --> 4465.38]  it's a good thing.
[4465.38 --> 4466.62]  It's a good thing.
[4467.34 --> 4467.74]  Wow,
[4467.82 --> 4468.12]  look at that.
[4468.18 --> 4469.06]  We even went and used
[4469.06 --> 4470.14]  the sets this time.
[4470.22 --> 4470.46]  Okay,
[4470.56 --> 4471.48]  that doesn't always happen.
[4471.74 --> 4471.88]  Cool.
[4471.98 --> 4472.62]  Good job everyone.
[4474.80 --> 4475.56]  And then,
[4475.66 --> 4476.28]  of course,
[4476.38 --> 4477.14]  there is something.
[4479.82 --> 4481.04]  The word wrapping on that.
[4482.62 --> 4484.10]  Spin into precision.
[4484.10 --> 4487.20]  Ceramic bearing.
[4488.06 --> 4489.82]  Internal bit storage.
[4490.58 --> 4493.18]  Super high quality construction.
[4494.12 --> 4494.80]  That's right.
[4494.92 --> 4496.82]  The LTT precision screwdriver
[4496.82 --> 4497.78]  is coming.
[4498.28 --> 4499.00]  All you got to do
[4499.00 --> 4500.04]  is put your email here
[4500.04 --> 4501.20]  and you will get a notification
[4501.20 --> 4502.76]  when it arrives.
[4504.22 --> 4504.76]  All right.
[4505.64 --> 4506.26]  Merch messages.
[4506.40 --> 4506.70]  Dan,
[4507.54 --> 4507.86]  hit me.
[4508.02 --> 4508.24]  Sure.
[4508.46 --> 4508.96]  Let's see.
[4509.24 --> 4509.50]  Hello,
[4509.76 --> 4510.68]  WAN.DLL.
[4511.02 --> 4512.50]  I started my IT career
[4512.50 --> 4513.60]  in the mid-90s
[4513.60 --> 4514.94]  with mainly PC building.
[4515.30 --> 4516.02]  I really enjoy
[4516.02 --> 4517.30]  build streams with Linus
[4517.30 --> 4518.86]  in the janky cooling adventures
[4518.86 --> 4520.12]  with Alex and Linus.
[4520.40 --> 4520.64]  Nice.
[4520.76 --> 4521.18]  Something coming up?
[4522.78 --> 4523.20]  Ooh,
[4523.40 --> 4524.72]  janky cooling adventures.
[4525.54 --> 4526.18]  Um...
[4528.32 --> 4528.88]  Oh,
[4529.12 --> 4530.72]  we saw that post on Reddit
[4530.72 --> 4531.64]  where someone's trying
[4531.64 --> 4532.68]  to passively cool
[4532.68 --> 4533.64]  a high-end GPU.
[4534.36 --> 4536.12]  We definitely think
[4536.12 --> 4537.26]  we have some ideas
[4537.26 --> 4537.90]  to contribute
[4537.90 --> 4538.86]  to that concept.
[4538.86 --> 4540.26]  so we're keeping
[4540.26 --> 4540.98]  an eye on it
[4540.98 --> 4542.22]  and we are
[4542.22 --> 4543.34]  potentially going
[4543.34 --> 4544.20]  to make our own
[4544.20 --> 4544.86]  run at it.
[4545.42 --> 4546.64]  That's one idea
[4546.64 --> 4547.22]  that we had.
[4548.04 --> 4548.76]  We...
[4548.76 --> 4550.08]  Let me try to think
[4550.08 --> 4550.90]  if there's anything else.
[4550.98 --> 4551.12]  I mean,
[4551.14 --> 4551.74]  we just got
[4551.74 --> 4552.62]  the Threadripper Pro
[4552.62 --> 4553.08]  one up.
[4557.50 --> 4557.94]  Okay.
[4558.16 --> 4558.86]  We're probably
[4558.86 --> 4559.60]  going to do
[4559.60 --> 4560.86]  whole editing
[4560.86 --> 4561.80]  Dan water cooling
[4561.80 --> 4562.42]  at some point.
[4563.50 --> 4564.48]  But I can't promise
[4564.48 --> 4565.02]  that's going to happen
[4565.02 --> 4565.76]  to any time
[4565.76 --> 4566.40]  immediately.
[4566.84 --> 4567.58]  How mad are you, Dan?
[4567.58 --> 4568.12]  How mad?
[4568.42 --> 4568.86]  How mad?
[4569.10 --> 4569.44]  Tell them.
[4570.10 --> 4570.48]  Go in.
[4570.56 --> 4571.48]  Am I going to get to help?
[4571.88 --> 4572.30]  Go in.
[4572.62 --> 4573.92]  Well, I don't see why not.
[4575.04 --> 4575.74]  Then I'm not mad.
[4576.36 --> 4577.54]  Oh, I see how it is.
[4577.54 --> 4578.18]  Then we're good.
[4578.32 --> 4578.70]  All right.
[4578.84 --> 4579.46]  Okay, okay,
[4579.50 --> 4580.22]  but I have something...
[4580.22 --> 4580.94]  Why would I be mad about that?
[4581.10 --> 4582.36]  You were giving me
[4582.36 --> 4583.66]  a talking to the other day
[4583.66 --> 4586.04]  about how we shouldn't
[4586.04 --> 4586.92]  water cool
[4586.92 --> 4588.04]  the editing machines
[4588.04 --> 4588.92]  with whole room water cooling.
[4589.52 --> 4589.86]  Or wait,
[4589.92 --> 4590.72]  were you on my side
[4590.72 --> 4591.56]  and we were talking to Sean
[4591.56 --> 4592.54]  and Sean didn't want to do it?
[4593.60 --> 4593.96]  I think...
[4593.96 --> 4595.12]  Someone didn't want to do it.
[4595.12 --> 4595.96]  I don't want to have
[4595.96 --> 4596.50]  water blocks
[4596.50 --> 4597.54]  on the GPUs anymore.
[4598.26 --> 4599.64]  Yeah, are we just doing CPU?
[4600.00 --> 4600.30]  No.
[4600.74 --> 4602.12]  How would we just do CPUs?
[4602.36 --> 4603.16]  Okay, but we can
[4603.16 --> 4603.72]  quick disconnect
[4603.72 --> 4604.52]  all the GPUs?
[4604.86 --> 4605.78]  I think we could, yeah.
[4605.78 --> 4605.94]  Yeah.
[4606.38 --> 4606.58]  Yeah.
[4606.58 --> 4607.14]  How about that?
[4607.14 --> 4608.18]  If they've got quick disconnects
[4608.18 --> 4609.34]  then it makes it super easy.
[4609.74 --> 4609.88]  Yeah.
[4609.88 --> 4610.62]  And especially if the
[4610.62 --> 4611.34]  quick disconnects
[4611.34 --> 4612.64]  just go to the back of the case.
[4612.76 --> 4614.20]  Like, it's not a problem at all.
[4614.40 --> 4615.02]  Hey, Jay!
[4615.02 --> 4616.00]  I have no issue with it.
[4617.06 --> 4618.12]  Hey, Jay's in chat.
[4618.32 --> 4619.02]  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[4620.36 --> 4621.24]  Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[4621.46 --> 4622.44]  It just feels ridiculous
[4622.44 --> 4623.64]  to have the air conditioning
[4623.64 --> 4624.60]  running in the winter
[4624.60 --> 4626.02]  for the editing day.
[4626.02 --> 4628.96]  Yeah, no, I was trying
[4628.96 --> 4629.40]  to defend it.
[4629.44 --> 4630.20]  I don't remember
[4630.20 --> 4631.02]  who was against...
[4631.02 --> 4631.94]  Someone was against it
[4631.94 --> 4632.32]  in that room.
[4632.36 --> 4633.16]  I don't remember who it was.
[4633.24 --> 4633.74]  Apparently, Dan,
[4633.74 --> 4634.14]  you're quiet.
[4634.36 --> 4635.40]  So you said...
[4635.40 --> 4636.60]  Quick disconnects on the GPUs, right?
[4636.60 --> 4636.82]  Quiet?
[4637.52 --> 4637.92]  Yeah.
[4638.14 --> 4638.76]  How the hell am I quiet?
[4639.26 --> 4639.74]  Well, I don't know.
[4639.80 --> 4640.48]  You're the producer.
[4640.48 --> 4642.16]  What are you asking me for?
[4642.20 --> 4642.96]  I'm just the talent.
[4643.16 --> 4644.00]  I'm just the face.
[4644.16 --> 4645.74]  I do seem quiet.
[4646.46 --> 4646.82]  Why is it quiet?
[4647.30 --> 4647.80]  Hey, Felix.
[4648.34 --> 4648.66]  Hey, Felix.
[4648.66 --> 4649.40]  The maintenance nightmare?
[4649.52 --> 4649.94]  What's your benefits?
[4649.96 --> 4650.50]  Dan, why didn't you just
[4650.50 --> 4651.50]  take a nice mic home?
[4651.76 --> 4652.90]  That sounds...
[4652.90 --> 4653.46]  No offense.
[4653.90 --> 4654.56]  Not great.
[4655.68 --> 4656.28]  Well, he didn't...
[4656.28 --> 4656.38]  No?
[4656.38 --> 4657.24]  He wasn't in.
[4658.52 --> 4659.76]  He would have had to come in.
[4659.84 --> 4660.10]  Oh.
[4660.36 --> 4661.48]  To get the mic to bring it home.
[4661.58 --> 4662.54]  Oh, okay.
[4662.78 --> 4662.98]  All right.
[4663.06 --> 4665.24]  I remember that I'm also on a call.
[4666.30 --> 4666.66]  Oh, yeah.
[4666.70 --> 4666.98]  Like, I'm not...
[4666.98 --> 4668.38]  You're not hearing my actual mic.
[4668.82 --> 4669.02]  Yeah.
[4669.02 --> 4670.06]  I don't know.
[4670.16 --> 4671.24]  Right, because why would you
[4671.24 --> 4672.74]  use your actual mic for a call?
[4673.10 --> 4673.98]  It's just a call.
[4674.70 --> 4675.88]  It's not like it's a podcast
[4675.88 --> 4676.72]  that, you know,
[4676.78 --> 4678.04]  thousands of people are watching.
[4678.16 --> 4679.26]  It's not, like, important or anything.
[4679.50 --> 4681.24]  AJ's commenting on the maintenance...
[4681.24 --> 4682.68]  This is untriggered right now.
[4682.86 --> 4683.46]  Look at him go.
[4684.40 --> 4685.12]  I'm not triggered.
[4685.70 --> 4686.18]  I'm not triggered.
[4687.10 --> 4687.78]  Oh, man.
[4687.94 --> 4689.24]  This isn't a condenser pencil.
[4689.52 --> 4689.70]  Nope.
[4690.98 --> 4691.52]  It's okay.
[4691.52 --> 4693.22]  We can fix it with some GoXLRs.
[4693.30 --> 4693.54]  Okay.
[4694.82 --> 4696.42]  AJ's commenting on the maintenance nightmare,
[4696.58 --> 4697.62]  but AJ, just think about it this way.
[4697.68 --> 4699.00]  It's just rampant.
[4699.02 --> 4700.56]  Rampant ongoing job security.
[4701.00 --> 4701.38]  Yeah.
[4701.44 --> 4702.18]  How would we ever...
[4702.18 --> 4703.74]  How would we ever get rid of the infra team
[4703.74 --> 4705.70]  as long as we keep implementing these, like,
[4705.82 --> 4707.30]  awful infra ideas?
[4708.90 --> 4709.82]  I think it's...
[4709.82 --> 4712.14]  There's got to be some amount of rule of cool,
[4712.54 --> 4713.68]  and it's pretty cool.
[4713.84 --> 4715.02]  And it's a bunch of content.
[4715.34 --> 4715.64]  Yeah.
[4716.04 --> 4717.64]  And ultimately, we make content.
[4717.70 --> 4718.90]  Yeah, and if you guys don't like them,
[4718.94 --> 4720.78]  then you can just rip them out after the video's over.
[4721.32 --> 4721.72]  Yeah.
[4721.84 --> 4723.30]  I don't think we should, but...
[4723.30 --> 4723.52]  Yeah.
[4723.70 --> 4723.94]  Yeah.
[4724.08 --> 4724.34]  Yeah.
[4724.50 --> 4724.72]  Yeah.
[4724.80 --> 4725.02]  Yeah.
[4725.10 --> 4725.46]  Yeah.
[4725.80 --> 4726.50]  What were we talking about?
[4726.62 --> 4727.20]  I don't know.
[4727.78 --> 4728.38]  Merch messages.
[4728.46 --> 4729.40]  The store something.
[4729.60 --> 4730.42]  AJ sold!
[4731.82 --> 4732.40]  Let's go.
[4733.94 --> 4734.36]  Oh, yeah.
[4734.42 --> 4735.06]  Merch messages.
[4738.14 --> 4738.86]  Was there another one?
[4738.92 --> 4739.88]  I thought we did two or three.
[4739.94 --> 4740.66]  Oh, hold on.
[4740.76 --> 4741.06]  Hold on.
[4741.06 --> 4742.42]  The Geek of All Things asks,
[4742.56 --> 4745.56]  will the precision driver storage need proprietary length bits?
[4745.72 --> 4746.84]  That's honestly the biggest reason
[4746.84 --> 4748.56]  I didn't buy your other screwdrivers.
[4749.48 --> 4750.88]  All I will say right now
[4750.88 --> 4753.00]  is people are going to like our bits.
[4753.82 --> 4754.84]  You're going to love our bits.
[4754.98 --> 4755.94]  You're going to love our bits.
[4756.38 --> 4757.04]  Watch this.
[4757.08 --> 4758.16]  You're going to love my bits.
[4762.12 --> 4764.28]  Are our standard screwdrivers,
[4764.30 --> 4765.74]  are those proprietary length,
[4765.80 --> 4766.52]  or are they just short?
[4766.52 --> 4768.46]  You know you can get them other places.
[4768.68 --> 4768.80]  Yeah.
[4769.02 --> 4772.50]  You can hack off a standard length one,
[4772.58 --> 4774.02]  and it's exactly the same shank.
[4774.28 --> 4774.42]  Yeah.
[4774.42 --> 4778.46]  Or you can put a longer bit in the screwdriver.
[4779.52 --> 4780.66]  You just can't store it in the handle.
[4780.84 --> 4782.30]  No, you can store it in the handle.
[4782.76 --> 4783.86]  But you have to align the thing.
[4783.88 --> 4785.56]  You can only fit six instead of 12.
[4785.66 --> 4785.84]  Yeah.
[4786.36 --> 4786.58]  Yeah.
[4786.66 --> 4787.56]  So it's not proprietary.
[4787.78 --> 4788.82]  It's not proprietary,
[4789.16 --> 4791.00]  but it is less common.
[4791.50 --> 4793.18]  The engineering team pointed out
[4793.18 --> 4796.02]  that you can actually get those bits more easily
[4796.02 --> 4797.54]  if you know what you're looking for.
[4798.82 --> 4803.34]  There's little ratcheting non-screwdrivers,
[4803.34 --> 4805.86]  like ratcheting, I don't know, what are they?
[4805.98 --> 4807.82]  Like a socket wrench.
[4807.98 --> 4808.22]  Wrench?
[4808.34 --> 4808.52]  Okay.
[4808.58 --> 4808.78]  Yeah.
[4809.04 --> 4810.90]  Yeah, but not a wrench.
[4811.44 --> 4815.34]  Ones that have a little socket for a screwdriver bit.
[4816.10 --> 4816.36]  Oh.
[4816.50 --> 4819.82]  So ratcheting screwdrivers, but like right angle.
[4820.20 --> 4820.56]  Okay.
[4820.68 --> 4821.68]  Ratcheting screwdrivers.
[4821.88 --> 4822.16]  Okay, I've never heard of that.
[4822.16 --> 4824.00]  And they often use low-profile bits.
[4824.10 --> 4825.28]  So if you get bits for those,
[4825.38 --> 4827.06]  they will fit in our screwdriver as well.
[4827.34 --> 4828.94]  They are not proprietary.
[4829.34 --> 4833.62]  They are just optimized for our screwdriver,
[4833.80 --> 4834.46]  and they are unusual.
[4836.52 --> 4836.92]  Okay.
[4837.48 --> 4839.36]  Okay, now I want to play a little game.
[4840.40 --> 4840.94]  Tynan's saying,
[4841.02 --> 4842.16]  I think we were saying,
[4842.56 --> 4843.54]  I think we were more saying
[4843.54 --> 4847.30]  the short bits make bit wrenches super nice.
[4847.86 --> 4849.00]  Oh, okay.
[4849.20 --> 4850.28]  Well, I know for a fact
[4850.28 --> 4852.26]  I found them for sale elsewhere as well.
[4852.62 --> 4853.50]  Yeah, like I don't,
[4853.62 --> 4854.86]  I'm pretty sure they're not proprietary.
[4854.96 --> 4856.20]  Basically our short bits are cool.
[4856.70 --> 4856.94]  Yeah.
[4857.64 --> 4857.96]  Okay.
[4858.28 --> 4859.04]  So this.
[4859.20 --> 4859.70]  What's that?
[4859.80 --> 4861.18]  Is a prototype of the precision.
[4861.40 --> 4861.86]  What's that?
[4862.64 --> 4864.64]  Oh, this is a prototype of our bit holder
[4864.64 --> 4867.00]  because obviously we're not just going to have a screwdriver.
[4867.08 --> 4867.68]  Don't worry about it.
[4868.34 --> 4869.64]  Although, although, although.
[4871.18 --> 4872.30]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[4872.30 --> 4874.18]  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[4874.18 --> 4878.56]  Oh, casual, casual magnetic mechanism for the parts tray.
[4879.00 --> 4880.40]  Is there magnets in the parts tray?
[4880.74 --> 4881.94]  Not now, but yes.
[4882.14 --> 4882.50]  Nice.
[4882.60 --> 4883.04]  Yeah, yeah.
[4883.18 --> 4883.50]  Nice.
[4884.70 --> 4885.82]  Anywho, anywho, anywho.
[4889.04 --> 4890.40]  Short bits are not moronic.
[4890.74 --> 4892.74]  People who think they're a moronic just don't understand.
[4893.38 --> 4894.68]  It improves the magnetism.
[4895.06 --> 4896.04]  It's not just a phase, Dad.
[4896.34 --> 4898.84]  And makes it fit more things,
[4899.24 --> 4901.16]  and it's really useful for those other things.
[4901.58 --> 4902.10]  Got them.
[4902.10 --> 4905.48]  Anyway, while we're doing the next one,
[4905.96 --> 4908.88]  I'm going to play a little game where I'm going to spin this.
[4909.16 --> 4910.20]  See if it stops before we're done?
[4910.26 --> 4911.98]  And we're going to see if it stops before we're done
[4911.98 --> 4915.96]  because that ceramic bearing in the top is freaking awesome.
[4916.88 --> 4917.14]  Okay.
[4917.24 --> 4919.62]  You barely touched it, and it's still going.
[4919.78 --> 4921.26]  I was going to offer as well.
[4921.32 --> 4921.60]  Whoa.
[4921.60 --> 4922.86]  Because I've got another one here too.
[4923.40 --> 4923.76]  Okay.
[4924.02 --> 4924.38]  Okay.
[4924.52 --> 4925.70]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4925.70 --> 4927.14]  I'm going to give it a really good spin.
[4927.70 --> 4928.16]  Oh, sorry.
[4928.24 --> 4929.10]  This is a hybrid bearing.
[4929.24 --> 4930.72]  Hybrid ceramic bearing.
[4930.82 --> 4931.24]  Thanks, Tynan.
[4931.24 --> 4932.88]  Tynan's got my back.
[4933.26 --> 4933.52]  Okay.
[4933.80 --> 4934.90]  I mean, there's ceramic in it,
[4935.12 --> 4936.34]  so I wasn't wrong about that.
[4936.42 --> 4937.70]  The ceramic one was too loud.
[4937.72 --> 4938.30]  I remember now.
[4938.80 --> 4939.06]  Okay.
[4939.16 --> 4939.38]  Okay.
[4939.48 --> 4939.74]  Okay.
[4939.82 --> 4940.36]  Ready, Dan?
[4941.62 --> 4941.98]  Go.
[4943.56 --> 4944.50]  Hi, DLL.
[4944.86 --> 4946.60]  Other than it has to get done,
[4946.78 --> 4948.88]  do you have advice on how to keep your workflow
[4948.88 --> 4952.14]  or focus on tasks that you don't find as much passion in?
[4952.60 --> 4953.90]  Also, Luke, change your mind.
[4954.60 --> 4955.40]  Change my mind.
[4955.56 --> 4957.10]  Tarkov is a roguelike.
[4959.18 --> 4962.44]  Well, for me, the big one is that I...
[4962.44 --> 4965.06]  Oh, man.
[4965.80 --> 4966.92]  I'm very distractible.
[4966.92 --> 4972.24]  A lot of the time, I really do just end up doing it in little chunks.
[4973.88 --> 4974.28]  Yeah.
[4974.36 --> 4977.48]  I think one way to do it is to reward yourself for the completion.
[4977.70 --> 4978.92]  Or I do it really late at night.
[4979.34 --> 4979.74]  Yes.
[4979.88 --> 4980.80]  When I can be super focused.
[4980.80 --> 4983.80]  I can focus way better late at night.
[4984.04 --> 4986.80]  I, like, turn on at probably around 9 p.m.
[4987.06 --> 4987.36]  Yeah.
[4987.36 --> 4992.08]  And it doesn't really, like, turn off until, like, 3 a.m., 4 a.m.
[4992.40 --> 4994.64]  And I can be laser focused and get stuff done.
[4994.74 --> 4995.26]  Gamer timing.
[4995.90 --> 4997.94]  Also, yeah, it's close to it,
[4997.94 --> 4999.38]  except that you can re-extract,
[4999.46 --> 5001.54]  which I think is maybe the issue where it fails.
[5001.72 --> 5002.32]  But there you go.
[5005.60 --> 5006.40]  It's still going.
[5008.54 --> 5009.56]  It's still going.
[5011.26 --> 5012.10]  And it's...
[5012.10 --> 5013.98]  Wow.
[5015.52 --> 5015.84]  Yeah.
[5016.70 --> 5017.10]  Wow.
[5017.36 --> 5019.38]  She's a goer.
[5021.28 --> 5021.96]  That's wild.
[5022.22 --> 5022.52]  Anyway.
[5025.36 --> 5028.00]  We know who our audience is.
[5028.74 --> 5029.62]  We see you.
[5033.02 --> 5034.52]  How do you have one at home, Dan?
[5038.14 --> 5038.46]  Prototype.
[5038.76 --> 5039.78]  Because I was using them for a while.
[5039.92 --> 5041.04]  No, no, we've issued them.
[5041.16 --> 5042.00]  It's still, like, this 3D printed one.
[5042.92 --> 5043.24]  Okay.
[5043.40 --> 5045.64]  Yeah, we've issued them to people to get feedback, though.
[5045.68 --> 5046.76]  This is very close to done.
[5046.76 --> 5048.68]  Do you have one of the hybrid ceramic bearing ones?
[5049.92 --> 5050.22]  Yes.
[5050.38 --> 5050.60]  Yeah.
[5051.32 --> 5051.72]  Nice.
[5051.72 --> 5053.32]  And I've expressed my complaints about that.
[5053.58 --> 5053.70]  Yeah.
[5054.00 --> 5054.20]  Oh.
[5054.26 --> 5054.86]  New ones are even better.
[5054.94 --> 5057.62]  I had one of the first bearing prototypes with the ceramics.
[5057.84 --> 5058.26]  Oh.
[5058.74 --> 5059.04]  Okay.
[5059.26 --> 5059.84]  They're still amazing.
[5060.26 --> 5060.98]  Still amazing.
[5061.74 --> 5062.70]  They're too loud, though.
[5063.14 --> 5064.86]  You mean the full ceramic bearing?
[5064.86 --> 5066.28]  Just trying to make sure you didn't steal it.
[5066.52 --> 5066.88]  Yeah.
[5067.08 --> 5067.86]  I'll go get it.
[5068.14 --> 5069.04]  No, we've issued.
[5069.04 --> 5069.50]  No, you're good.
[5070.14 --> 5070.38]  You're good.
[5070.38 --> 5071.44]  You don't trust me at all, do you?
[5072.44 --> 5076.24]  I feel like Remote Dan is like Darkside Dan or something.
[5076.42 --> 5078.36]  I'm scared of Remote Dan's power.
[5079.66 --> 5080.74]  He's got a lot of power.
[5080.74 --> 5085.10]  I don't even have to be near you to ruin the Wancho.
[5087.36 --> 5088.68]  Don't ruin the Wancho.
[5089.64 --> 5090.12]  Anywho.
[5090.52 --> 5095.38]  So Sebastian has built quite a lot of these in various configurations to get feedback from
[5095.38 --> 5096.90]  people and make sure that everything's good.
[5096.90 --> 5105.54]  One of the really cool things that the team did is rather than using a retaining pin like
[5105.54 --> 5110.08]  the mechanism for the bit storage does in the full-size driver, it's magnetic in this
[5110.08 --> 5110.30]  one.
[5111.46 --> 5115.34]  So in theory, it should have even better longevity.
[5115.86 --> 5115.94]  Cool.
[5117.28 --> 5121.54]  And it also just is so satisfying.
[5121.84 --> 5124.18]  Again, we see you.
[5126.90 --> 5133.48]  Yeah, this is a lot of people have been like, oh, a relationship with iFixit ended.
[5133.84 --> 5135.30]  Best friend now, you know, whoever.
[5135.54 --> 5136.88]  But not at all.
[5137.00 --> 5139.74]  We are not going head to head with iFixit.
[5140.42 --> 5144.80]  Our driver is going to be at a very different price point, for one thing.
[5145.82 --> 5146.84]  This is not free.
[5147.38 --> 5148.74]  The development wasn't free.
[5149.24 --> 5150.70]  We think it's a really great driver.
[5150.80 --> 5152.34]  We think people are really going to love it.
[5152.64 --> 5156.56]  But iFixit is probably going to be more affordable for the foreseeable future.
[5156.90 --> 5165.82]  And iFixit has a wide range of products that we couldn't, even if we wanted to, couldn't
[5165.82 --> 5166.22]  replicate.
[5167.04 --> 5172.18]  Like, we are not going to get into adhesive strips for putting the screen back onto your
[5172.18 --> 5172.52]  iMac.
[5173.16 --> 5174.04]  That's not happening.
[5174.42 --> 5175.80]  We're not going to create guides.
[5175.80 --> 5180.62]  We're not going to have this comprehensive, we're not going to partner with Valve for
[5180.62 --> 5182.16]  Steam Deck replacement parts.
[5182.78 --> 5188.24]  So the way that we see it, and the way we've, as we've discussed with iFixit, is this relationship
[5188.24 --> 5188.84]  continues.
[5189.10 --> 5191.28]  We both have very similar values.
[5191.42 --> 5192.78]  We both have a very similar mission.
[5192.90 --> 5194.30]  We want things to be more repairable.
[5194.40 --> 5196.04]  We want things to be more upgradable.
[5196.12 --> 5197.46]  We don't want things in landfills.
[5197.90 --> 5199.48]  And so, what, we have a screwdriver?
[5199.96 --> 5201.52]  So what, we're not going to, like, partner anymore?
[5201.70 --> 5203.26]  That would feel kind of ridiculous.
[5203.78 --> 5205.30]  Did we want to develop a screwdriver?
[5205.60 --> 5206.56]  I mean, yeah, we did.
[5206.68 --> 5210.06]  But no, we're not going to terminate our relationship if iFixit over that.
[5210.12 --> 5210.68]  That would be silly.
[5211.08 --> 5211.18]  Yeah.
[5212.18 --> 5214.66]  What wouldn't be silly is picking the next topic.
[5215.48 --> 5216.70]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[5216.86 --> 5217.24]  I think.
[5217.36 --> 5217.80]  Is that right?
[5218.02 --> 5218.66]  Are we doing that, Dan?
[5218.72 --> 5219.08]  I think so.
[5219.46 --> 5221.34]  It just says when after dark on the screen.
[5221.34 --> 5222.54]  So, I don't know what to do.
[5226.64 --> 5228.02]  Okay, Luke, do you want to pick a topic?
[5228.54 --> 5230.16]  I will try to do so.
[5230.78 --> 5232.88]  Teenager criminally charged for Snapchat joke.
[5233.20 --> 5237.50]  British citizen Aditya Verma, I hope I'm saying that right.
[5237.60 --> 5237.76]  Sure.
[5237.88 --> 5238.56]  Probably didn't.
[5238.82 --> 5245.16]  Is currently being tried in Spain for causing public disorder over a 2022 airport security
[5245.16 --> 5245.54]  incident.
[5245.54 --> 5250.58]  He was boarding a plane to the Spanish island of Menorca.
[5251.22 --> 5257.00]  18-year-old Verma jokingly messaged the friends he was traveling with over Snapchat,
[5257.80 --> 5262.56]  quote, quote, on my way to blow up the plane.
[5263.24 --> 5269.56]  And then in brackets, I'm a member of the Taliban, which I have now said into a microphone on the
[5269.56 --> 5269.88]  internet.
[5270.88 --> 5273.00]  Look, I'm not saying Hitler was right.
[5273.00 --> 5274.12]  Oh, my God.
[5274.12 --> 5278.20]  Man, I don't even have to be in the same room and you guys just ruin the way and show
[5278.20 --> 5278.64]  yourself.
[5281.06 --> 5281.88]  Oh, no.
[5282.58 --> 5284.00]  I think yours is worse.
[5284.14 --> 5284.66]  Probably.
[5288.58 --> 5289.78]  Oh, geez.
[5290.36 --> 5298.64]  According to court testimony, it's assumed that the message was picked up via Gatwick's
[5298.64 --> 5299.96]  Wi-Fi network.
[5299.96 --> 5300.58]  Oh, no.
[5301.12 --> 5302.96]  Verma says that he was...
[5302.96 --> 5304.14]  Oh, interesting.
[5304.54 --> 5308.60]  Verma says that he was not using Gatwick's Wi-Fi, but it's unclear whether or not the
[5308.60 --> 5310.30]  message's recipients were.
[5310.98 --> 5311.14]  Got it.
[5311.14 --> 5316.44]  UK security services then alerted Spanish authorities who scrambled two fighter jets!
[5316.44 --> 5317.86]  No way!
[5317.86 --> 5318.52]  To escort the plane until it landed.
[5318.52 --> 5323.40]  What is a fighter jet going to do if someone is on board a plane threatening to blow it up?
[5323.40 --> 5325.12]  If you blow up that plane, I'll shoot it with a missile!
[5325.74 --> 5327.66]  We'll blow it up before you can blow it up!
[5327.74 --> 5328.48]  You can't quit!
[5328.56 --> 5329.16]  You're fired!
[5330.74 --> 5331.62]  Pun intended!
[5332.98 --> 5334.36]  That is an interesting one.
[5334.36 --> 5338.28]  Let me get that for you.
[5338.44 --> 5338.94]  Oh, thank you.
[5339.18 --> 5340.22]  There's more on the keyboard.
[5340.48 --> 5340.64]  Yeah.
[5341.72 --> 5342.28]  Nice.
[5343.24 --> 5343.76]  Perfect.
[5346.62 --> 5347.18]  Wow.
[5347.42 --> 5347.68]  Okay.
[5349.12 --> 5349.68]  Yeah.
[5349.72 --> 5353.02]  The two fighter jets were scrambled to escort the plane until it landed.
[5353.44 --> 5357.30]  Verma was arrested in Spain and later questioned by British intelligence.
[5357.30 --> 5358.26]  Wow.
[5358.54 --> 5363.10]  Note, there are frequent claims on the internet that Snapchat encrypts pictures and videos,
[5363.26 --> 5365.44]  but not plain text messages.
[5365.72 --> 5370.20]  However, Snapchat's own website makes no such claim and only says that the messages sent
[5370.20 --> 5372.48]  via its service are private.
[5373.76 --> 5380.04]  Well, I mean, there's plenty of messages sent on Snapchat that are of privates.
[5381.76 --> 5382.28]  Yeah.
[5382.28 --> 5383.96]  Come on, I get nothing for that?
[5384.24 --> 5384.50]  Yeah.
[5384.70 --> 5386.92]  Nothing when I spit on your computer one time?
[5386.92 --> 5387.82]  I was too busy reading.
[5387.88 --> 5390.08]  I spit on your computer one time.
[5390.18 --> 5391.02]  I get nothing.
[5391.30 --> 5392.32]  That was pretty good.
[5393.62 --> 5394.78]  I'm going to do it myself.
[5398.06 --> 5398.86]  He's going to ding.
[5398.96 --> 5399.46]  He's going to ding.
[5399.56 --> 5399.98]  He's going to ding.
[5400.14 --> 5400.84]  There it is.
[5401.36 --> 5401.98]  Very nice.
[5402.34 --> 5404.50]  Without Dan's mic, are they able to hear that very well?
[5404.88 --> 5405.20]  I don't know.
[5405.22 --> 5405.52]  It doesn't matter.
[5405.58 --> 5406.38]  It's the principle of the thing.
[5406.48 --> 5406.70]  Yeah.
[5406.80 --> 5406.98]  Yeah.
[5407.02 --> 5407.40]  Fair enough.
[5408.62 --> 5410.06]  It came through fine.
[5410.74 --> 5411.00]  Nice.
[5411.00 --> 5411.28]  Perfect.
[5411.78 --> 5416.08]  Jessica said, it seems likely that if it were end-to-end encrypted, that they would
[5416.08 --> 5418.10]  say so, which I completely agree with.
[5418.46 --> 5428.16]  If found guilty, Verma could be fined around $24,000 and made to pay over $100,000 for the
[5428.16 --> 5433.22]  Spanish military's extremely useful in this case, two fighter jets.
[5434.24 --> 5434.80]  Yeah.
[5435.04 --> 5435.58]  Wow.
[5436.28 --> 5437.06]  Very interesting.
[5437.66 --> 5438.26]  Discussion question.
[5438.38 --> 5443.06]  Is scanning messages sent over on public Wi-Fi a reasonable security precaution?
[5443.30 --> 5448.52]  Is the average person using public Wi-Fi or Snapchat aware that this is even a possibility?
[5448.52 --> 5453.12]  Is this a proportionate response on the part of Spanish authorities?
[5453.12 --> 5454.80]  So here's the thing.
[5455.38 --> 5455.82]  No.
[5456.12 --> 5456.96]  Buddy's 18.
[5458.56 --> 5465.78]  I probably would have made an edgy joke as I'm driving to the border about, you know,
[5465.82 --> 5468.04]  smuggling something when I was 18.
[5468.20 --> 5469.10]  I know better now.
[5469.62 --> 5473.50]  I've heard, I don't know if this is actually true, but I've heard there are microphones.
[5474.08 --> 5475.24]  I've heard this too.
[5475.32 --> 5478.40]  So they can listen to you in your car while you wait to cross the border.
[5479.00 --> 5480.78]  I don't know if it's true.
[5480.78 --> 5483.26]  Me neither, but I always say nice things.
[5483.42 --> 5485.48]  But I just, I just keep.
[5485.48 --> 5486.22]  Or don't say anything.
[5486.40 --> 5488.74]  I just keep my damn mouth shut.
[5488.80 --> 5489.00]  Yeah.
[5489.38 --> 5493.60]  Anytime I'm anywhere near an airport, anywhere near a border.
[5493.98 --> 5494.16]  Yeah.
[5494.26 --> 5496.46]  Anywhere near a customs officer.
[5496.72 --> 5499.90]  It's just not worth it.
[5500.08 --> 5500.34]  Yeah.
[5500.76 --> 5502.32]  But at 18, like.
[5505.96 --> 5507.36]  I don't know, man.
[5507.46 --> 5508.46]  Like, do we really.
[5508.64 --> 5510.14]  Want to crush his life for a joke?
[5510.14 --> 5515.06]  But then like an 18 year old can definitely, you know, commit a crime.
[5515.40 --> 5515.60]  Yep.
[5515.98 --> 5518.58]  So, dude, I don't know.
[5519.24 --> 5522.34]  I wonder what the age distribution for crimes are.
[5524.42 --> 5525.30]  I don't know.
[5525.40 --> 5527.34]  Financial ones way over here.
[5528.10 --> 5530.58]  Other more different ones, probably less there.
[5531.42 --> 5532.60]  That's interesting too.
[5532.70 --> 5534.56]  Type of crime age distribution.
[5534.92 --> 5535.22]  Yeah.
[5535.22 --> 5538.18]  Like, like what's the average murderer age?
[5538.68 --> 5538.94]  Yeah.
[5539.00 --> 5543.02]  You know, what's the average, you know, B&E age?
[5543.76 --> 5545.16]  I suspect it's actually.
[5545.28 --> 5545.88]  Probably younger.
[5546.10 --> 5546.84]  Fairly specific.
[5547.00 --> 5549.62]  Probably skew younger for like breaking in or breaking in.
[5549.88 --> 5552.12]  Physical crimes probably skew younger.
[5552.24 --> 5552.82]  Financial crimes probably skew older.
[5552.82 --> 5552.92]  Yeah.
[5552.92 --> 5556.46]  You don't want to be like senior citizen, like trying to, you know.
[5557.72 --> 5558.06]  Yeah.
[5558.48 --> 5558.84]  Yeah.
[5558.84 --> 5559.04]  Yeah.
[5559.04 --> 5559.24]  Yeah.
[5559.48 --> 5559.70]  Yeah.
[5559.70 --> 5559.78]  Yeah.
[5559.78 --> 5559.88]  Yeah.
[5559.88 --> 5560.98]  Old fisticuffs.
[5561.20 --> 5561.36]  Yeah.
[5563.02 --> 5565.12]  Difference between smuggling and terrorist threats.
[5565.36 --> 5565.72]  Yeah.
[5566.30 --> 5566.70]  Sure.
[5566.78 --> 5569.52]  But it like they're going to flag it one way or the other.
[5569.60 --> 5570.94]  The response will just be different.
[5570.94 --> 5574.94]  And the question, our discussion question was, should they be monitoring that?
[5575.02 --> 5582.50]  I mean, what I would want to say is they should have had a proportional response based
[5582.50 --> 5582.96]  on that.
[5583.06 --> 5588.94]  He clearly wasn't organized enough to be, you know, not using public Wi-Fi or not using
[5588.94 --> 5590.90]  freaking Snapchat for the communication.
[5591.10 --> 5594.98]  But the flip side of that is like, have you ever looked up dumb criminal montages?
[5595.22 --> 5595.38]  Yeah.
[5595.58 --> 5599.48]  Like that's how they catch criminals is that criminals are dumb as fuck.
[5599.48 --> 5605.48]  So, yeah, it's pretty obviously a joke to me, but it's not going to be obviously a joke
[5605.48 --> 5605.98]  to everyone.
[5607.62 --> 5611.64]  But I mean, fining him $124,000 when he's 18.
[5613.08 --> 5614.82]  Like he's going to have to declare bankruptcy.
[5615.04 --> 5617.52]  That's that's life changing stuff right there.
[5617.86 --> 5622.44]  Can you declare bankruptcy on a government fine like that?
[5622.54 --> 5623.30]  I don't know.
[5624.00 --> 5625.98]  I don't know how bankruptcy works.
[5626.06 --> 5627.06]  I've never been bankrupt.
[5627.32 --> 5627.76]  Yeah, me too.
[5627.76 --> 5628.52]  Yeah.
[5629.48 --> 5632.22]  I know you can't for student loans because you hear that on the Internet.
[5632.98 --> 5633.90]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5633.94 --> 5635.24]  No, that's that's like a thing.
[5635.28 --> 5635.80]  That's a thing.
[5635.94 --> 5636.78]  At least in the States.
[5636.92 --> 5638.84]  Can you can't can you for like in the States?
[5638.98 --> 5640.84]  But can you do that for defamation settlements?
[5641.58 --> 5642.44]  I have no idea.
[5642.64 --> 5643.34]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5643.62 --> 5644.16]  I don't know.
[5646.66 --> 5647.06]  Sponsors?
[5647.74 --> 5648.06]  Sure.
[5648.22 --> 5648.40]  Yeah.

[5781.76 --> 5784.38]  Finally, the show is brought to you by Vessi.
[5786.04 --> 5792.92]  It rained 149 out of 365 days in 2023 here in Vancouver.
[5793.18 --> 5797.46]  But thank goodness we had Vessi, our sponsor, to keep our socks dry.
[5798.04 --> 5801.08]  Vessi's here to help you walk through puddles instead of around them.
[5801.08 --> 5804.66]  I still wouldn't do that because, yeah, you see how his foot splashed there?
[5804.80 --> 5807.90]  That can definitely hit the cuff of your other leg.
[5808.10 --> 5808.78]  Pant leg.
[5809.12 --> 5809.28]  Yeah.
[5809.66 --> 5810.92]  See, that...
[5810.92 --> 5811.10]  Yeah.
[5811.22 --> 5814.12]  See, your pants will get wet, actually, at the...
[5814.12 --> 5814.30]  Okay.
[5814.76 --> 5815.82]  Yeah, that one's not too bad.
[5815.86 --> 5816.78]  That's a controlled walk.
[5816.84 --> 5818.48]  But the other one was pretty hardcore.
[5818.60 --> 5821.32]  Anyway, the point is, their shoes are stylish and comfortable.
[5821.58 --> 5825.42]  And most importantly, they say 100% a waterproof.
[5825.42 --> 5831.20]  Unlike your Rubbermaid rain boots that are unbreathable, Vessi weaves waterproofing technology
[5831.20 --> 5833.42]  into the knit to keep them breezy.
[5833.70 --> 5837.08]  They have all kinds of different shoes for different occasions, from slippers to their
[5837.08 --> 5842.86]  most adventure-ready Ulta High Top, which is designed to take on slippery, slushy, chilly
[5842.86 --> 5843.96]  winter conditions.
[5844.40 --> 5845.36]  Not much of an adventurer.
[5845.70 --> 5849.12]  Their weekend and everyday classic sneakers are great for just wearing about.
[5849.48 --> 5850.42]  Cleaning is super easy.
[5850.66 --> 5854.04]  For the weekend shoes, they are machine washable, or you can just wipe them with a sponge.
[5854.04 --> 5856.06]  So don't let the rain stop you from moving.
[5856.32 --> 5861.12]  With a 365-day guarantee, you can leave your wet socks in the past by heading to Vessi.com

[5867.56 --> 5868.14]  Thank you.
[5868.24 --> 5869.16]  Thank you for helping with that.
[5869.34 --> 5869.74]  No problem.
[5871.98 --> 5873.38]  Oh, it's time for merch messages.
[5873.58 --> 5876.50]  Dan, why don't you go ahead and hit me?
[5878.88 --> 5880.58]  Am I supposed to be doing this as well?
[5880.66 --> 5882.24]  I don't know if I have this in me.
[5882.74 --> 5883.32]  Well, I'll try.
[5883.32 --> 5884.32]  Hey, DLL.
[5884.32 --> 5885.32]  You're going to say, yeah.
[5886.38 --> 5887.18]  Hey, DLL.
[5887.98 --> 5894.22]  My mother recently just received a USB to USB-C cable in the mall, in the mail, that
[5894.22 --> 5894.88]  she didn't order.
[5895.24 --> 5896.10]  Cut it up and threw it away.
[5896.20 --> 5898.78]  But I'm wondering how a scam like this would be cost-effective.
[5899.46 --> 5900.50]  Was it a bad one?
[5900.60 --> 5901.94]  Did you run it through a tester?
[5902.02 --> 5904.44]  There are testers to find out if they're malicious cables.
[5904.44 --> 5912.14]  But I would not imagine a scam like that to be particularly cost-effective, depending on...
[5912.14 --> 5913.74]  It depends if they're targeted.
[5914.10 --> 5914.94]  If it's targeted, yeah.
[5914.94 --> 5920.68]  If this person's mom works in a medical field or something like that, and they were trying
[5920.68 --> 5924.54]  to target them for patient data or something, then absolutely it would be cost-effective.
[5924.82 --> 5925.22]  Yeah, I know.
[5925.22 --> 5925.86]  If they were just like...
[5925.86 --> 5928.00]  I know certain medical procedures she performs.
[5928.46 --> 5928.72]  Wow.
[5928.90 --> 5930.20]  No, I'm just teasing.
[5930.28 --> 5930.52]  Wow.
[5930.68 --> 5931.04]  Wow.
[5931.04 --> 5931.18]  Wow.
[5937.50 --> 5942.78]  Yeah, I can't imagine just randomly shipping out a thousand USB cables.
[5943.04 --> 5944.06]  It depends, though.
[5944.30 --> 5944.74]  Be valuable.
[5944.86 --> 5947.04]  If they're the ones that are...
[5947.82 --> 5951.06]  That you can have Wi-Fi and stuff built into them.
[5951.14 --> 5955.02]  Like if it's an OMG cable or something like that, it's definitely not cost-effective.
[5955.08 --> 5956.06]  Those are quite expensive.
[5956.06 --> 5962.76]  But if all it has in it is a tiny amount of storage and it just farts a little payload
[5962.76 --> 5964.76]  onto your computer, yeah, potentially.
[5964.76 --> 5968.00]  I still think it would probably need to be targeted, though, because you're still paying
[5968.00 --> 5969.26]  shipping, all this other kind of stuff.
[5969.38 --> 5970.46]  And what do you...
[5970.46 --> 5972.42]  Shipping's cheap in the UK, though.
[5974.14 --> 5978.16]  And there's a lot of places, actually, that shipping is super cheap compared to Canada.
[5978.34 --> 5979.12]  I'm used to Canadian shipping.
[5979.32 --> 5980.32]  Canadian shipping is...
[5980.32 --> 5981.20]  Send a cable to someone.
[5981.28 --> 5982.02]  It's like $15.
[5982.48 --> 5982.72]  Yeah.
[5982.98 --> 5984.10]  It'd be down the road.
[5984.32 --> 5984.58]  Yeah.
[5984.58 --> 5984.98]  Yeah.
[5986.42 --> 5986.78]  Yeah.
[5986.98 --> 5992.54]  Oh, Cohen Lemon says you would target a neighborhood where it's just generally wealthier people.
[5993.82 --> 5995.92]  So you just send them to like a wealthy zip code.
[5995.94 --> 5998.14]  You could totally do that with shipping, too.
[5998.24 --> 5998.64]  So, yeah.
[5998.70 --> 6000.14]  I mean, it could be like...
[6000.14 --> 6001.44]  I would call that...
[6001.44 --> 6003.04]  I'm just making this up on the spot.
[6003.26 --> 6004.66]  But I would call that like soft targeting.
[6004.92 --> 6005.82]  WAN Database, Arthur.
[6006.04 --> 6007.40]  You don't know the half of it.
[6008.18 --> 6011.74]  Royal Mail is super cheap compared to what we have to pay.
[6011.74 --> 6014.62]  I mean, it makes sense.
[6014.80 --> 6015.74]  You guys are like...
[6016.36 --> 6016.78]  Little tiny...
[6016.78 --> 6018.96]  Eeny weeny, now that you don't own the whole world.
[6019.04 --> 6019.30]  Little small.
[6019.30 --> 6019.82]  How's it feel?
[6020.56 --> 6021.22]  Very small.
[6021.30 --> 6021.60]  Got him.
[6027.48 --> 6027.88]  Yeah.
[6028.00 --> 6029.74]  Their ruler is still on our money, so...
[6030.86 --> 6031.30]  Yeah.
[6031.36 --> 6033.74]  Why do we have to have stupid Charles on the money?
[6033.92 --> 6034.38]  So stupid.
[6034.38 --> 6036.06]  I didn't even mind it when it was Elizabeth.
[6036.28 --> 6039.34]  She seemed generally not the stupidest.
[6039.50 --> 6040.68]  And at least it didn't like...
[6040.68 --> 6043.00]  Her whole thing with the car was very funny.
[6043.32 --> 6045.60]  I'm going to screw up that story if I try to sell it, so I'm just not.
[6046.72 --> 6047.52]  But, yeah.
[6047.62 --> 6048.88]  And at least it didn't like change.
[6050.12 --> 6056.74]  Like, we had to incur, I'm assuming, a relatively significant expense to like reprint a bunch of money.
[6057.42 --> 6057.82]  Well, no.
[6057.88 --> 6058.70]  They don't reprint it.
[6058.74 --> 6060.04]  They just print what they like print.
[6060.04 --> 6060.36]  Oh, okay.
[6060.44 --> 6062.12]  So just change design and continue forward?
[6062.26 --> 6062.44]  Yeah.
[6062.90 --> 6063.66]  That's not too bad.
[6063.66 --> 6069.38]  But, like, eventually they do recall old series and issue new series.
[6069.44 --> 6069.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6070.04 --> 6074.30]  But that's generally for security more than it is for just like...
[6074.30 --> 6074.48]  Yeah.
[6074.72 --> 6074.98]  Yeah.
[6075.16 --> 6075.48]  Redesign.
[6075.72 --> 6077.44]  It's a different old person on the thing.
[6077.54 --> 6078.86]  I thought they issued a redesign.
[6079.10 --> 6080.26]  I didn't really follow it, though.
[6080.26 --> 6080.40]  Yeah.
[6080.46 --> 6082.08]  I mean, there was still design time.
[6082.32 --> 6083.26]  There's still...
[6084.38 --> 6085.72]  It's still a pain.
[6086.60 --> 6087.38]  But, yeah.
[6088.14 --> 6088.54]  Anyway.
[6089.04 --> 6089.24]  Yeah.
[6090.10 --> 6091.96]  Why not put more loons or geese on the money?
[6092.06 --> 6092.20]  Yeah.
[6092.26 --> 6093.24]  I mean, I'd be...
[6093.24 --> 6093.60]  I'd be down.
[6093.66 --> 6095.40]  Why don't we put frickin' Terry Fox on the money?
[6095.64 --> 6095.82]  Yeah.
[6095.96 --> 6096.94]  Like, what the fuck?
[6098.14 --> 6098.48]  Well, he was.
[6098.48 --> 6098.70]  For what?
[6098.70 --> 6100.72]  For like a limited series or something?
[6100.84 --> 6101.72]  No, just put him on there.
[6101.72 --> 6101.78]  I didn't think so.
[6102.32 --> 6103.12]  I didn't think it was.
[6103.22 --> 6103.66]  Oh, is he?
[6104.16 --> 6104.56]  I don't know.
[6104.66 --> 6106.18]  I never carry cash anymore.
[6107.18 --> 6108.24]  I thought he was on a $5 bill or something.
[6108.24 --> 6109.74]  Like, we have Canadian heroes.
[6109.74 --> 6116.36]  In 2020, a short list of eight bank notable Canadians were to be portrayed on the $5 vertical
[6116.36 --> 6118.72]  polymer bills in place of Laurier.
[6119.84 --> 6122.26]  So, yeah.
[6122.34 --> 6123.34]  I guess it was limited.
[6123.48 --> 6124.42]  I didn't realize it was limited.
[6124.42 --> 6125.12]  Well, that's stupid.
[6125.26 --> 6126.20]  It should just be...
[6126.20 --> 6127.58]  It should just be Terry Fox forever.
[6127.96 --> 6128.14]  Yeah.
[6128.44 --> 6135.78]  Like, for real, for real, guys, if you don't know who Terry Fox is, he's an absolute unit.
[6135.98 --> 6137.02]  You should go read about him.
[6137.48 --> 6141.20]  It's one of the most inspiring stories that you will ever hear.
[6141.28 --> 6142.16]  He's incredible.
[6142.60 --> 6143.14]  What a Chad.
[6143.40 --> 6143.60]  Yeah.
[6144.44 --> 6145.42]  Absolute unit.
[6145.42 --> 6145.44]  What a Terry.
[6145.44 --> 6145.64]  Unit.
[6147.76 --> 6148.34]  All right.
[6149.22 --> 6151.54]  Apparently, for a limited time, he was also on our loony.
[6152.66 --> 6154.10]  Well, it should just be all the time.
[6154.56 --> 6154.76]  Yeah.
[6155.00 --> 6155.22]  Yeah.
[6155.62 --> 6155.84]  Yeah.
[6156.10 --> 6156.36]  Yeah.
[6156.72 --> 6157.04]  Okay.
[6157.12 --> 6158.26]  You heard it here first.
[6158.34 --> 6158.56]  Yeah.
[6158.72 --> 6162.06]  We're advocating for Terry Fox on all the money instead of King Charles.
[6162.34 --> 6162.68]  Yeah.
[6163.36 --> 6169.32]  Like, how many greater thans would we need for Terry Fox versus King Charles?
[6169.32 --> 6170.96]  And the government of Canada should forcibly take over Tim Hortons.
[6171.16 --> 6172.20]  Those two things should happen.
[6172.66 --> 6172.92]  Okay.
[6172.94 --> 6175.42]  I don't know that I would want the Canadian government running it, but how do we need to do that?
[6175.42 --> 6176.48]  How about some Canadians?
[6176.94 --> 6177.16]  Yeah.
[6177.44 --> 6177.98]  How about that?
[6178.06 --> 6178.40]  Fair enough.
[6178.46 --> 6178.58]  Okay.
[6178.58 --> 6179.26]  We can agree on that.
[6179.36 --> 6179.52]  Yeah.
[6179.86 --> 6180.36]  Very good.
[6180.58 --> 6180.90]  Very good.
[6181.02 --> 6181.30]  Very good.
[6181.66 --> 6181.94]  Very good.
[6185.62 --> 6187.56]  How many marathons has Charles run?
[6188.82 --> 6190.18]  Fewer than Terry, probably.
[6191.60 --> 6193.12]  And Terry didn't finish one.
[6193.26 --> 6194.28]  What was at the end of the marathon?
[6194.42 --> 6195.82]  What was the goal for Charles?
[6196.26 --> 6197.02]  I'm not going to continue down that path.
[6197.02 --> 6197.22]  Okay.
[6197.22 --> 6197.92]  I'm not going to continue down that path.
[6197.92 --> 6202.66]  To be clear, he finished a lot of marathon distances, but I mean the one, the marathon.
[6202.94 --> 6205.26]  And you guys will have to read about him if you want to learn about Terry.
[6205.42 --> 6205.60]  Okay.
[6207.26 --> 6207.58]  Yeah.
[6208.00 --> 6208.30]  Okay.
[6208.70 --> 6208.98]  Yeah.
[6210.14 --> 6212.50]  Remember having Terry Fox day and sports events at school?
[6212.64 --> 6212.80]  Yeah.
[6212.82 --> 6213.34]  It was great.
[6213.46 --> 6214.40]  I love that they did that.
[6214.50 --> 6215.04]  They still do.
[6215.30 --> 6215.56]  Great.
[6215.74 --> 6215.88]  Yeah.
[6215.92 --> 6217.06]  Terry Fox day is totally still a thing.
[6217.08 --> 6217.62]  That's very good.
[6217.68 --> 6218.84]  We should have Terry Fox day forever.
[6219.06 --> 6219.26]  Yeah.
[6219.26 --> 6222.68]  Until we get a better Canadian than Terry Fox.
[6222.76 --> 6222.88]  Yeah.
[6222.88 --> 6223.16]  Good luck.
[6223.26 --> 6223.90]  Terry Fox day.
[6224.14 --> 6224.28]  Yeah.
[6224.28 --> 6224.54]  Good luck.
[6224.60 --> 6225.94]  So we'll have Terry Fox day forever.
[6226.04 --> 6226.22]  Yeah.
[6229.72 --> 6232.92]  I feel like that's a thing that would actually get Canadians like really riled up.
[6232.92 --> 6235.78]  If people tried to like go in on Terry Fox.
[6236.40 --> 6236.72]  Oh.
[6237.26 --> 6237.54]  Unacceptable.
[6237.54 --> 6238.92]  I think that would be guns out time.
[6239.10 --> 6239.28]  Yeah.
[6239.32 --> 6239.74]  Unacceptable.
[6239.88 --> 6241.14]  I'm talking these, but you know.
[6241.16 --> 6241.28]  Yeah.
[6241.28 --> 6241.32]  Yeah.
[6241.32 --> 6241.44]  Yeah.
[6241.44 --> 6241.88]  Unacceptable.
[6241.88 --> 6242.16]  Yeah.
[6242.94 --> 6243.14]  Yeah.
[6243.74 --> 6244.14]  Man.
[6244.96 --> 6246.08]  Don't go after Terry Fox.
[6246.10 --> 6246.44]  Yeah, man.
[6246.48 --> 6247.36]  I'd be really angry.
[6247.58 --> 6247.96]  Me too.
[6248.34 --> 6248.98]  I would actually.
[6248.98 --> 6251.92]  I could see his face.
[6252.86 --> 6254.20]  You went there for a second.
[6254.24 --> 6254.70]  No, man.
[6254.78 --> 6255.30]  Oh, boy.
[6255.32 --> 6255.96]  Oh, you don't.
[6256.00 --> 6256.78]  Oh, man.
[6257.32 --> 6257.56]  Yeah.
[6257.62 --> 6258.26]  No, you don't.
[6259.60 --> 6260.64]  Leave Terry alone.
[6260.74 --> 6261.00]  Yeah.
[6262.06 --> 6262.80]  Oh, man.
[6262.94 --> 6263.34]  All right.
[6263.50 --> 6263.86]  All right.
[6263.90 --> 6264.40]  Next one.
[6266.00 --> 6266.24]  Sure.
[6267.00 --> 6267.82]  Hey, LLD.
[6268.22 --> 6272.92]  I've just finished my first week at my first job at 19 and I love it.
[6273.24 --> 6277.70]  Though I struggle to keep my personal life from affecting my work and do not want it to affect
[6277.70 --> 6278.40]  this one.
[6278.40 --> 6279.38]  Any advice?
[6286.76 --> 6288.14]  That's tough, man.
[6288.30 --> 6293.06]  Like, I don't think it's possible.
[6294.40 --> 6299.30]  Like, I think I speak for both of us when I say there have been times when our personal
[6299.30 --> 6300.68]  lives have affected work.
[6301.22 --> 6302.08]  Oh, yeah.
[6302.18 --> 6304.50]  And affected, like, our work with each other.
[6304.66 --> 6304.86]  Yeah.
[6305.42 --> 6307.24]  In a negative way, to be clear.
[6307.24 --> 6307.30]  Sure.
[6307.94 --> 6308.30]  Like.
[6309.08 --> 6310.86]  And probably vice versa.
[6310.86 --> 6312.52]  But yes, in a negative way, for sure.
[6312.70 --> 6312.92]  Yeah.
[6313.30 --> 6313.58]  Yeah.
[6313.74 --> 6314.04]  Well.
[6316.50 --> 6316.90]  Okay.
[6317.10 --> 6317.52]  Okay.
[6317.64 --> 6318.50]  Here's an example.
[6318.50 --> 6322.24]  I've had a pretty tough five months or so.
[6323.02 --> 6326.80]  I think it's probably affected how short I've been sometimes.
[6326.80 --> 6328.46]  I'm not proud of it.
[6329.22 --> 6330.26]  Oh, fuck off.
[6334.26 --> 6335.96]  You can't see my face either.
[6335.96 --> 6336.36]  But.
[6336.36 --> 6336.96]  Oh, man.
[6336.96 --> 6340.88]  Oh, man.
[6341.42 --> 6342.54]  Oh, man.
[6342.74 --> 6343.02]  Okay.
[6343.22 --> 6343.52]  Sorry.
[6343.60 --> 6345.18]  Don't make me spit on your laptop, man.
[6345.18 --> 6353.60]  All right.
[6353.60 --> 6353.88]  Sorry.
[6354.02 --> 6355.16]  That was a serious moment.
[6355.30 --> 6355.70]  Anyway.
[6355.98 --> 6358.12]  The point is, do your best, right?
[6358.12 --> 6361.42]  Other people don't deserve to deal with your baggage.
[6362.04 --> 6366.86]  And if you have the right mindset about it, the relationships you build at work and the
[6366.86 --> 6369.54]  things you do at work can be an oasis.
[6370.88 --> 6371.62]  At times, yeah.
[6371.62 --> 6374.16]  There have been times in my life when I'd rather be working.
[6374.56 --> 6380.40]  There have been times where I didn't want to go home because by working, I was very focused.
[6380.82 --> 6381.00]  Yep.
[6381.36 --> 6384.56]  So I'm not saying that that's healthy.
[6385.20 --> 6390.22]  I'm just saying that you should try to make the most of it.
[6391.18 --> 6391.62]  Wow.
[6391.68 --> 6392.38]  I don't know how to say your name.
[6392.44 --> 6396.28]  But someone in Philippine chat said, 19 is too young to be mature enough to keep mentally
[6396.28 --> 6396.66]  separate.
[6396.76 --> 6397.36]  He will get there.
[6397.70 --> 6400.46]  That's another thing that honestly, I would back up a little bit.
[6400.46 --> 6407.74]  I find it gets a little easier to kind of split things when you need to and to emotionally
[6407.74 --> 6409.52]  moderate as you get older.
[6409.72 --> 6410.96]  I have found that personally.
[6411.28 --> 6411.82]  I don't know how.
[6412.08 --> 6416.38]  I mean, hormonally, it makes sense because you just kind of get a little.
[6416.70 --> 6417.68]  They start decreasing.
[6417.92 --> 6418.08]  Yeah.
[6418.14 --> 6421.86]  You get just a little more, a little less juiced.
[6422.08 --> 6422.30]  Yeah.
[6422.92 --> 6423.76]  Pretty literally.
[6423.94 --> 6424.06]  Yeah.
[6429.02 --> 6429.50]  Yeah.
[6429.50 --> 6429.96]  I don't know.
[6429.96 --> 6430.66]  It's tough though.
[6430.80 --> 6434.08]  There's going to be times where you're not going to be able to completely do it.
[6434.20 --> 6436.98]  Step one is recognizing that it's a potential problem though.
[6437.24 --> 6437.56]  Yes.
[6437.62 --> 6438.48]  That can help a lot.
[6438.60 --> 6440.06]  Being cognizant of it is huge.
[6440.08 --> 6445.20]  You can self-analyze in a situation and try to figure out like, okay, I'm not going to
[6445.20 --> 6446.16]  be able to handle this properly.
[6446.24 --> 6447.88]  Do I need to remove myself from this scenario?
[6448.06 --> 6449.50]  And it helps not take things personally.
[6449.50 --> 6449.86]  Yeah.
[6449.94 --> 6457.06]  Like if someone's like, you know, yo, you know, this work isn't up to your usual standard.
[6457.30 --> 6458.10]  We need an improvement.
[6458.22 --> 6462.54]  You know, let's say you end up in a coaching session or something because it's been going,
[6462.62 --> 6466.14]  it was ongoing for a while and it's like really affecting the quality of the work.
[6467.14 --> 6467.54]  Hypothetically.
[6467.54 --> 6468.26]  Right.
[6468.26 --> 6471.48]  So if you can basically go, hey, hey, I am not being attacked.
[6472.06 --> 6472.92]  This is.
[6473.22 --> 6474.30]  I am capable of more.
[6474.30 --> 6479.50]  And I need to, and I need to refocus if I, if I want to perform at the way that, you
[6479.50 --> 6481.70]  know, I want to perform, which will be good for my career.
[6482.12 --> 6484.22]  The way that I'm being compensated for, et cetera, et cetera.
[6484.40 --> 6485.06]  All of this, right.
[6485.10 --> 6488.02]  You know, assumes that everyone's acting in good faith, right?
[6488.02 --> 6490.80]  Like you might just have like a shitty boss or something like that.
[6490.80 --> 6492.40]  And they're just beating you up or whatever.
[6492.40 --> 6492.68]  Right.
[6492.68 --> 6498.58]  Like I, I'm assuming a best case scenario where, where you're, you're in a job that,
[6498.58 --> 6502.60]  you know, it has a, you're in a healthy workplace environment at a, at a healthy company
[6502.60 --> 6506.02]  where, where feedback is given in a, in a respectful professional manner.
[6506.02 --> 6510.90]  But, um, there's definitely ways that you can utilize being aware of it to, to help
[6510.90 --> 6515.92]  to, to modulate yourself, moderate yourself both, I guess.
[6516.50 --> 6517.30]  Yeah, it worked.
[6518.30 --> 6520.78]  But yeah, I mean, you're going to go through some stuff.
[6521.24 --> 6527.10]  Um, I think as people start getting into their twenties and thirties, like grandparents
[6527.10 --> 6529.72]  start to kind of pass away at a fairly high rate.
[6529.94 --> 6532.38]  Dan Vale's given me a posture check on float plane.
[6532.60 --> 6532.96]  Sorry.
[6535.90 --> 6536.96]  Thank you, Dan Vale.
[6538.66 --> 6540.60]  Everybody, everybody take the posture check.
[6541.20 --> 6544.54]  Um, but yeah, you, you start kind of going through some stuff.
[6544.94 --> 6547.44]  Um, relatives passing away.
[6548.16 --> 6548.76]  Um, yeah.
[6549.12 --> 6550.32]  Relationship is a big one.
[6550.62 --> 6551.60]  It's like relationship.
[6551.72 --> 6553.70]  Maybe, maybe you'll break up with your significant other.
[6553.96 --> 6554.40]  Yep.
[6554.58 --> 6556.50]  Or maybe your significant other is going through something.
[6556.94 --> 6557.70]  And that'll be worse.
[6558.00 --> 6558.38]  Yes.
[6559.04 --> 6559.96]  To be completely honest.
[6560.32 --> 6560.76]  Yep.
[6560.76 --> 6561.58]  Seen that before.
[6561.82 --> 6566.36]  And, and what if your significant other is going through something really, really hard
[6566.36 --> 6571.26]  and the support of that person is very draining and you're just gassed out emotionally when
[6571.26 --> 6571.90]  you get to work.
[6571.90 --> 6576.62]  Um, like there's, there's, there's, there's just so many different things that can come
[6576.62 --> 6582.16]  up that can make emotional regulation difficult and that will affect your work.
[6582.16 --> 6585.00]  So just try your best.
[6589.10 --> 6589.62]  Next one.
[6589.62 --> 6592.86]  No, we don't need a shock collar for posture checks.
[6592.96 --> 6593.38]  Corey G.
[6593.38 --> 6596.36]  I've spent enough of my life with a shock collar on.
[6598.30 --> 6598.70]  Man.
[6598.74 --> 6602.02]  The one Elijah got for that video is flipping crazy.
[6602.98 --> 6607.94]  Like I think Medi actually felt bad about shocking me with it.
[6607.98 --> 6611.82]  And normally he just shocks me because he thinks it's hilarious and he has no remorse
[6611.82 --> 6612.30]  whatsoever.
[6614.72 --> 6615.92]  It's very painful.
[6616.20 --> 6616.74]  That's rough.
[6616.74 --> 6617.24]  All right.
[6617.42 --> 6617.82]  Hit me, Dan.
[6619.20 --> 6620.32]  Hi, LLD.
[6620.84 --> 6623.08]  Scrapyard Wars is what brought me to your channel.
[6623.38 --> 6624.58]  Love to hear it's returning.
[6625.02 --> 6626.52]  Can you share any details about it?
[6626.82 --> 6630.38]  I love to see the content about older and budget good enough hardware.
[6630.92 --> 6631.64]  Right now.
[6631.72 --> 6635.36]  The only thing that I can share is that we are shopping it to sponsors.
[6635.44 --> 6638.76]  As soon as we have one, we're going to lock in some production dates.
[6638.96 --> 6643.14]  The concept is really good, but I don't want to say what it is yet because I would love
[6643.14 --> 6644.62]  for it to just be a surprise.
[6644.80 --> 6645.88]  I don't even think I know what it is.
[6645.88 --> 6646.42]  No, you don't.
[6646.72 --> 6649.82]  Oh, I think that gives you an unfair advantage, sir.
[6650.14 --> 6650.86]  No, it doesn't.
[6651.06 --> 6651.44]  Oh, okay.
[6651.56 --> 6652.24]  Yeah, it'll be fine.
[6652.30 --> 6652.66]  Sounds good.
[6652.76 --> 6652.90]  Yeah.
[6653.52 --> 6653.96]  I'm excited.
[6653.96 --> 6659.62]  If anything, this will be the most fair one in a very long time.
[6661.54 --> 6663.06]  Oh, wait, I think I do know what it is.
[6663.56 --> 6664.06]  Oh, okay.
[6664.12 --> 6664.46]  Well then.
[6664.86 --> 6665.22]  Yeah.
[6666.58 --> 6666.98]  Yeah.
[6667.50 --> 6667.80]  Okay.
[6672.96 --> 6673.96]  Oh, more topics.
[6674.52 --> 6674.92]  Okay.
[6675.00 --> 6675.84]  Let's do topics.
[6676.88 --> 6678.36]  Luke, what do you want to do for a topic?
[6680.90 --> 6683.54]  We've got, whoa, something's happening to the doc.
[6683.92 --> 6685.10]  What's going on?
[6686.46 --> 6688.10]  Is it just like drawing smiley faces?
[6688.26 --> 6688.62]  Was that you?
[6689.62 --> 6689.88]  What?
[6690.50 --> 6691.24]  In the doc?
[6691.30 --> 6693.36]  The teenager criminally charged for Snapchat joke.
[6693.46 --> 6694.48]  It's just like random.
[6695.64 --> 6696.00]  Oh, no.
[6696.06 --> 6696.98]  I mashed your keyboard.
[6698.42 --> 6700.12]  It made a bunch of smiley faces.
[6700.22 --> 6700.78]  That's amazing.
[6701.78 --> 6702.14]  Okay.
[6702.14 --> 6702.68]  Oh, here.
[6702.74 --> 6703.00]  Hold on.
[6703.06 --> 6703.32]  Hold on.
[6703.40 --> 6704.38]  Really quick here, guys.
[6704.68 --> 6705.90]  So here's what he's talking about.
[6705.90 --> 6709.58]  I had planned to do this this week.
[6710.04 --> 6711.56]  Someone posted on...
[6711.56 --> 6711.96]  Oh, where'd it go?
[6712.34 --> 6712.50]  Yeah.
[6712.50 --> 6714.42]  I even brought my Apple TV.
[6714.92 --> 6719.90]  But someone posted on Reddit after I had complained last week about how it was impossible for me
[6719.90 --> 6723.78]  to cancel my Apple Arcade subscription from my Apple TV.
[6724.32 --> 6732.68]  Someone posted saying they didn't appreciate the negligence and the way that I ranted about it without actually checking if it was true.
[6732.68 --> 6740.12]  I responded on Reddit saying, hey, I see your screenshot that shows you are able to cancel it.
[6740.42 --> 6742.00]  I don't know if this is a regional difference.
[6742.12 --> 6743.18]  I don't know if it's a change.
[6743.48 --> 6745.54]  It's definitely something I experienced.
[6745.94 --> 6759.76]  Here's a link to someone else who experienced the same thing that also links to Apple's own support documentation that verifies that there is no way to cancel it on Apple Arcade or without installing iTunes.
[6760.60 --> 6761.62]  So I don't know what to tell you.
[6761.62 --> 6762.52]  They deleted the post.
[6762.64 --> 6764.78]  We had a good chat about it in the pre-show.
[6764.88 --> 6766.28]  They're actually a float plane subscriber.
[6766.48 --> 6767.52]  So we're all cool.
[6767.66 --> 6768.38]  Everything's cool.
[6768.64 --> 6772.50]  But I had intended to do a segment where I try it live.
[6772.50 --> 6775.90]  I'm going to subscribe to Apple Arcade again, and then I'm going to try to unsubscribe.
[6776.24 --> 6779.38]  But Dan isn't in this week, so I guess we're going to do it next week.
[6779.44 --> 6783.44]  I'm just letting you guys know I haven't forgotten about it, and I do want to get to the bottom of that.
[6783.64 --> 6785.30]  I suspect it's a regional requirement.
[6785.86 --> 6786.20]  Could be.
[6786.38 --> 6789.80]  Some country requires you to be able to cancel it through whatever or something.
[6789.80 --> 6803.98]  Well, now that we know that Apple plans to allow third-party marketplaces in the EU only, it's very clear that Apple has different flows depending on the region and that they can do that.
[6804.20 --> 6804.30]  Yeah.
[6804.58 --> 6806.04]  Or at least they will at that time.
[6806.24 --> 6806.34]  Yeah.
[6806.34 --> 6808.22]  Gaming is still bleeding jobs.
[6808.32 --> 6814.84]  So far in 2024, the gaming industry has lost a total of around 5,670 jobs.
[6816.34 --> 6831.50]  I know this isn't just gaming industry, but if you go to layoffs.fyi, which is a pretty cool website, it shows that in 2024 so far, 91 tech companies with layoffs have accumulated 24,564 employees laid off.
[6831.50 --> 6833.34]  That isn't just gaming, though.
[6833.72 --> 6836.20]  That's like tech industry in general.
[6836.30 --> 6837.92]  So those are definitely different things.
[6838.32 --> 6842.50]  More than half of the job losses seen in the gaming industry, at least, over the...
[6842.50 --> 6846.60]  Total around 5,670 jobs.
[6846.72 --> 6850.88]  More than half the job losses seen over the course of last year.
[6850.88 --> 6851.32]  Yeah.
[6852.00 --> 6858.60]  So we've already lost over half as many jobs in 2024 as we did in all of 2023.
[6860.38 --> 6860.82]  Yeah.
[6860.96 --> 6862.80]  Maybe in gaming specifically.
[6863.06 --> 6863.28]  In gaming.
[6863.44 --> 6863.64]  Yeah.
[6863.74 --> 6864.22]  Yes, in gaming.
[6864.22 --> 6867.02]  Not in tech, because tech was over 250,000 people.
[6867.02 --> 6868.18]  Tech was brutal last year.
[6868.28 --> 6868.46]  Yeah.
[6869.48 --> 6875.42]  So I just keep inserting tech, even though that's not what the topic is talking about at all, which is very cool of me.
[6875.42 --> 6883.00]  However, about confusion and a lack of communication, meaning they didn't know whether or not they still have a job.
[6883.52 --> 6893.82]  Riot Games has announced they're laying off around 11% of their global staff, 530 employees, while CEO Dylan Jedea...
[6893.82 --> 6895.32]  They put in the pronunciation.
[6895.62 --> 6896.32]  That's sick.
[6896.46 --> 6896.58]  Wow.
[6896.76 --> 6898.06]  Shout out Jessica and Riley.
[6898.06 --> 6898.42]  Yeah.
[6898.84 --> 6900.52]  Jedea claimed, quote,
[6900.52 --> 6919.60]  He likewise described these layoffs as the result of several risky management decisions, including the company doubling its headcount over the course of only a few years and taking big bets in 2019 that didn't pay off.
[6919.60 --> 6926.04]  It is unclear from the memo whether Riot leadership will be undergoing any changes or sustaining any pay cut.
[6926.04 --> 6933.30]  Notably, Jedea was president of the company for six years before becoming CEO in 2023.
[6933.92 --> 6949.36]  Riot says they will be offering departing staff at least six months of severance pay with a top-up to cover their health benefits, six months of access to job placement services, and a laptop for job search purposes if they don't have one.
[6949.44 --> 6950.04]  Holy crap.
[6950.88 --> 6952.22]  That's really generous.
[6952.30 --> 6953.96]  That's insanely generous.
[6953.96 --> 6962.16]  That's pretty good.
[6962.28 --> 6965.10]  I mean, our discussion question is, is there a right way to handle layoffs?
[6965.16 --> 6969.82]  I'd say even half of that would have been pretty darn right way.
[6970.08 --> 6970.96]  Very, like...
[6972.08 --> 6972.36]  Yeah.
[6972.92 --> 6973.72]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[6973.84 --> 6975.40]  Half a year of salary is wild.
[6975.66 --> 6976.68]  That's really outstanding.
[6976.68 --> 6985.56]  I mean, that would give me a lot of confidence to apply to a company like Riot knowing that, okay, I'm either...
[6985.56 --> 6986.88]  If it doesn't work out...
[6986.88 --> 6994.48]  If it doesn't work out, these are people who, when they make a mistake, they make a good faith effort to deal with it.
[6994.72 --> 6994.86]  Yeah.
[6994.86 --> 6999.32]  Like, yeah, sometimes you hire someone and you know what?
[7000.32 --> 7002.58]  This project, it doesn't make sense anymore.
[7003.38 --> 7005.66]  But at least they're taking it on the chin.
[7005.78 --> 7006.82]  They're eating the cost.
[7007.34 --> 7010.94]  Dude, 530 employees, six-month salaries?
[7011.28 --> 7011.50]  Yeah.
[7011.88 --> 7013.68]  That's millions and millions of dollars.
[7014.38 --> 7014.82]  Wow.
[7014.82 --> 7027.06]  Like, they are putting their money where their mouth is and taking care of the errors that management made that led to these redundancies.
[7027.20 --> 7027.98]  I think that's really...
[7027.98 --> 7028.48]  That's huge.
[7028.82 --> 7029.14]  Wow.
[7029.78 --> 7030.04]  Yep.
[7031.00 --> 7031.30]  Wow.
[7031.40 --> 7032.20]  That's a big move.
[7032.44 --> 7032.70]  Yeah.
[7033.38 --> 7034.06]  Love to see it.
[7034.50 --> 7037.00]  You know what I'd love to see a lot less than that?
[7038.16 --> 7039.36]  This is great.
[7039.64 --> 7041.22]  I hope you haven't read this yet.
[7041.22 --> 7054.58]  But during a recent CNBC interview, Hewlett Packard CEO Enrique Lores made a series of what are described in our notes as inflammatory statements.
[7055.44 --> 7058.68]  In other words, he was a raging shithead.
[7060.26 --> 7066.52]  He said that customers who buy printers are, and this is a quote, an investment.
[7066.52 --> 7074.52]  And that if that customer doesn't buy enough ink and supplies, they are a bad investment.
[7076.00 --> 7078.92]  I would hazard to believe they're selling their printers at a loss.
[7079.26 --> 7081.90]  If they were, I would maybe understand this statement.
[7082.24 --> 7084.24]  I'm not sure I'm convinced of that anymore.
[7084.46 --> 7085.70]  I seriously doubt they do.
[7085.96 --> 7092.00]  Lores further stated that in the long term, HP wants to make printing a subscription.
[7092.00 --> 7098.80]  That is a direct quote, which will reduce the barriers to printing.
[7099.04 --> 7101.64]  Are you f***ing listening to yourself, sir?
[7103.36 --> 7105.98]  Could you be more out of touch?
[7107.02 --> 7107.70]  Commercial?
[7108.28 --> 7108.72]  Okay.
[7109.80 --> 7110.28]  Fine.
[7110.78 --> 7111.86]  Let's talk about that.
[7112.36 --> 7117.50]  For my inkjet ass printer that I use like once every f***ing six months,
[7118.78 --> 7119.26]  no.
[7119.26 --> 7127.46]  If I want to buy a little syringe needle nonsense thing and inject some stupid crappy third party
[7127.46 --> 7133.68]  ink into my thing because it clogged and I don't feel like getting a brand new one,
[7134.70 --> 7136.86]  I'm going to do that.
[7137.70 --> 7140.10]  They put chips in their ink cartridges now.
[7140.14 --> 7140.56]  Do you know that?
[7141.12 --> 7141.36]  Yeah.
[7141.60 --> 7146.12]  And let's talk about that for a second because the next point, which I have also heard about.
[7146.12 --> 7146.20]  This is great.
[7146.30 --> 7147.20]  This is great.
[7147.58 --> 7148.18]  Enraged me.
[7148.18 --> 7150.20]  I wanted to do it, but you do it.
[7150.24 --> 7150.66]  You do it.
[7150.70 --> 7152.12]  I took all your topics today.
[7152.20 --> 7152.64]  You do it.
[7153.60 --> 7158.02]  Lores likewise alleged that viruses can be embedded in third party cartridges
[7158.02 --> 7161.22]  and used to infect a user's network through their printer.
[7161.62 --> 7166.26]  Research firm Actionable Intelligence proved that this kind of attack was theoretically possible
[7166.26 --> 7169.26]  in 2022 in response to an HP bug bounty.
[7169.26 --> 7175.80]  But HP has acknowledged that there are no known cases such as a hack that have occurred.
[7176.32 --> 7182.10]  What would be crazy if you stopped making them that way so that this wasn't possible?
[7182.10 --> 7183.78]  Why does the cartridge have a chip in it?
[7183.78 --> 7185.66]  It's your fault!
[7185.66 --> 7186.66]  Okay.
[7186.66 --> 7187.66]  Okay.
[7187.66 --> 7190.02]  Okay.
[7190.02 --> 7190.06]  Okay.
[7190.06 --> 7190.10]  Okay.
[7190.10 --> 7190.14]  Okay.
[7190.14 --> 7190.54]  Okay.
[7190.54 --> 7190.60]  Okay.
[7190.60 --> 7191.04]  Okay.
[7191.04 --> 7191.10]  Okay.
[7191.10 --> 7192.10]  Okay.
[7192.10 --> 7192.72]  Discussion question.
[7192.72 --> 7193.20]  Yeah.
[7193.20 --> 7194.44]  When will the EU come for HP?
[7194.44 --> 7195.28]  Hopefully quickly.
[7195.28 --> 7195.64]  Now.
[7195.64 --> 7196.30]  Yeah.
[7196.30 --> 7196.36]  Yeah.
[7196.36 --> 7198.58]  Do, are there any EU regulators?
[7198.58 --> 7201.42]  Like, can we, can we get, can I get in touch?
[7201.42 --> 7201.86]  Uh.
[7201.86 --> 7202.88]  Because I have ideas.
[7202.88 --> 7204.54]  Like, I'm, I'm down.
[7204.74 --> 7210.46]  If anyone, if anyone actually, like, has the ear of anyone who works at any, like, EU regulatory
[7210.46 --> 7215.42]  bodies that deal with this kind of stuff, man, I'd be happy to chat.
[7215.58 --> 7216.16]  I want to chat.
[7216.16 --> 7216.72]  Free consulting.
[7216.90 --> 7220.10]  Look, I'm not saying that government regulation is the answer to everything.
[7220.18 --> 7221.14]  I'll meet you on your hours.
[7221.14 --> 7221.86]  It's not.
[7222.86 --> 7228.76]  But when this is what's happening, if this is what the free market says is okay, then
[7228.76 --> 7232.86]  we can't do it because the, the terrible things that we're currently doing might be
[7232.86 --> 7234.78]  dangerous for you if you try to circumvent them.
[7236.94 --> 7237.46]  What?
[7238.58 --> 7240.64]  We opened up this attack vector.
[7240.76 --> 7242.34]  We opened Pandora's box.
[7242.46 --> 7245.18]  So now, um, you know, that's not on us.
[7245.26 --> 7246.12]  That's on you.
[7246.94 --> 7247.42]  No.
[7247.66 --> 7248.62]  F*** off.
[7248.74 --> 7249.70]  Oh, man.
[7251.82 --> 7252.10]  Yeah.
[7252.34 --> 7252.64]  Q.
[7253.92 --> 7257.18]  Kaplah42 says, hashtag framework printer.
[7257.86 --> 7259.74]  Don't imagine for a second.
[7259.88 --> 7260.60]  I haven't brought it up.
[7260.60 --> 7268.22]  The issue is that there's a small handful of companies that own basically every printer
[7268.22 --> 7271.40]  related intellectual property thing.
[7272.20 --> 7274.06]  Good frigging luck.
[7275.46 --> 7275.86]  Yeah.
[7275.92 --> 7276.64]  That makes sense.
[7277.30 --> 7277.66]  Burn it.
[7281.08 --> 7285.26]  That was, that was like, I was laughing during the, I did, I did read this ahead of time.
[7285.26 --> 7288.32]  I was laughing during the first paragraph and I was enraged during the second one.
[7288.88 --> 7290.26]  Just what a joke.
[7290.84 --> 7291.10]  Yeah.
[7291.22 --> 7292.14]  What a joke.
[7295.18 --> 7295.58]  Gross.
[7295.76 --> 7299.40]  We need to sell you armor because our car randomly tries to stab you in the chest.
[7299.50 --> 7299.68]  Yeah.
[7299.76 --> 7302.84]  It's like, make it stop doing that.
[7302.98 --> 7303.14]  Yeah.
[7303.14 --> 7303.64]  Like, yeah.
[7303.86 --> 7305.22]  How about just don't do that?
[7307.00 --> 7307.40]  Anyways.
[7307.74 --> 7308.40]  What else we got today?
[7308.40 --> 7309.16]  Oh my God.
[7309.36 --> 7315.16]  We have, uh, we had so many product announcements that I just like, didn't even talk about.
[7316.66 --> 7318.26]  Um, okay.
[7318.46 --> 7319.42]  Did we even talk about this?
[7319.50 --> 7320.44]  I'm so sorry.
[7320.60 --> 7321.18]  I know.
[7321.30 --> 7322.34]  I don't think so.
[7322.76 --> 7323.76]  I've been wearing it for the show.
[7323.84 --> 7326.26]  How did we have so many product things today?
[7326.40 --> 7327.58]  That is, this is a lot of stuff.
[7327.62 --> 7329.04]  We have a short circuit t-shirt.
[7329.22 --> 7331.72]  It's like the short circuit long sleeve, but it's a t-shirt.
[7331.82 --> 7332.96]  Look how cool it is.
[7335.14 --> 7335.54]  Yeah.
[7335.54 --> 7336.66]  Damn.
[7336.88 --> 7337.88]  That's a cool shirt.
[7338.06 --> 7338.74]  It's pretty cool.
[7338.94 --> 7339.26]  Yeah.
[7339.74 --> 7341.80]  And there's, but wait, there's more.
[7342.46 --> 7344.10]  We have a white shirt now.
[7344.22 --> 7346.50]  It's a hundred percent cotton for people who like.
[7346.62 --> 7347.78]  Oh, it's just a plain white shirt.
[7347.78 --> 7348.84]  One hundred percent cotton.
[7349.06 --> 7349.40]  Sweet.
[7349.74 --> 7354.30]  And it's, it's got a really great hand feel still, even though it's not the same material
[7354.30 --> 7355.46]  as our typical shirt.
[7355.78 --> 7357.26]  Uh, it's a bit heavier.
[7357.66 --> 7358.36]  Uh, oh yeah.
[7358.40 --> 7358.96]  Look at that.
[7359.06 --> 7359.32]  Okay.
[7359.48 --> 7359.86]  Heavier.
[7359.86 --> 7362.22]  Uh, whatever this were grams per square meat.
[7362.30 --> 7363.36]  I forget what this is.
[7363.40 --> 7364.20]  I made that up.
[7364.24 --> 7365.18]  That maybe is what it is.
[7365.18 --> 7372.74]  But it's a little bit on the heavier side to, um, to, to hide those, to be a little
[7372.74 --> 7373.82]  less see-through.
[7374.00 --> 7376.56]  Pure white shirts, as cool as they are, can have some see-through issues.
[7376.56 --> 7382.40]  So, but really similar fit to our 60, 40 cotton poly tees and, uh, looks great all the
[7382.40 --> 7384.42]  way from extra small to triple XL.
[7384.58 --> 7387.38]  I think that's what HP does when they sell you printers.
[7387.52 --> 7387.62]  Yeah.
[7387.62 --> 7387.80]  Yeah.
[7387.80 --> 7388.00]  Yeah.
[7388.00 --> 7388.16]  Yeah.
[7388.16 --> 7388.34]  Yeah.
[7388.34 --> 7388.36]  Yeah.
[7388.36 --> 7389.24]  We've all seen the bit.
[7389.36 --> 7389.50]  Yeah.
[7389.56 --> 7389.82]  Yeah.
[7390.02 --> 7390.18]  Yeah.
[7391.00 --> 7392.64]  Um, was there anything else?
[7392.64 --> 7392.92]  Holy crap.
[7393.14 --> 7394.06]  I think you did everything else.
[7394.06 --> 7394.32]  Okay.
[7394.32 --> 7396.30]  Did I, did I, did I hit everything else?
[7396.40 --> 7396.92]  I think so.
[7397.10 --> 7397.36]  Yeah.
[7397.36 --> 7397.70]  Okay.
[7397.78 --> 7398.20]  All right.
[7398.76 --> 7400.46]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[7400.50 --> 7403.08]  Maybe we'll just talk about them again next week or something like that.
[7403.16 --> 7405.24]  And they, we'll be trying, try and double dip.
[7405.76 --> 7406.12]  Yeah.
[7406.46 --> 7407.30]  We'll be like Apple.
[7407.50 --> 7408.24]  We'll just double dip.
[7408.48 --> 7409.32]  And then you gotta do it a lot.
[7409.32 --> 7411.58]  And you gotta pay a subscription once we send it to you.
[7411.64 --> 7416.26]  You gotta send us our like protection money for your shirt.
[7416.26 --> 7416.66]  Yeah.
[7417.20 --> 7417.72]  Um, yeah.
[7419.04 --> 7420.16]  Uh, next topic.
[7420.64 --> 7421.08]  Uh, yeah.
[7421.20 --> 7422.42]  Why no super review?
[7422.88 --> 7423.08]  Oh.
[7423.44 --> 7428.70]  Nvidia launched the RTX 4070 super last week on the 17th and we'll be launching the 4080
[7428.70 --> 7430.92]  super next week on January 31st.
[7430.92 --> 7433.50]  There was also a 4070 TI super.
[7433.72 --> 7435.64]  I think I can't remember which other super there was.
[7435.70 --> 7436.04]  It doesn't matter.
[7436.04 --> 7444.24]  The point is we haven't done an LTT review of either of them, um, because we didn't feel
[7444.24 --> 7452.56]  like dealing with Nvidia's six embargoes for this launch for all those for each of the
[7452.56 --> 7453.38]  three cards.
[7453.38 --> 7457.18]  And remember guys, these are not new GPUs.
[7457.40 --> 7465.48]  These are a thing that we already had, but like slightly re-comajiggered and they had six
[7465.48 --> 7466.30]  embargoes.
[7466.36 --> 7467.18]  Is that three per card?
[7467.82 --> 7468.92]  That is two per card.
[7469.12 --> 7469.94]  There were three cards.
[7470.26 --> 7470.42]  Oh.
[7470.82 --> 7471.00]  Yeah.
[7471.08 --> 7473.46]  So there's an unboxing embargo for each card.
[7473.66 --> 7474.10]  And then a product review embargo?
[7474.20 --> 7475.24]  And then a review embargo.
[7475.54 --> 7476.18]  Oh, wait.
[7476.24 --> 7476.92]  Did I say six?
[7476.96 --> 7478.28]  I meant nine embargoes.
[7478.44 --> 7478.68]  So.
[7479.06 --> 7483.50]  Or maybe it's not nine because at least one of them has a separate review embargo for the
[7483.50 --> 7486.30]  Founders Edition and for the AIB cards.
[7486.60 --> 7493.44]  I can't, I can't remember, but basically I saw the schedule and I said, okay, number one,
[7494.14 --> 7495.30]  f*** off Nvidia.
[7495.48 --> 7495.56]  Yeah.
[7496.92 --> 7498.08]  Just launch them.
[7498.50 --> 7499.66]  Just launch them.
[7499.80 --> 7500.94]  We'll be happy to review them.
[7501.08 --> 7502.14]  We'll put them all together.
[7502.42 --> 7510.90]  Number two, I just, I'm sorry, but I just, I just think it's ridiculous for our viewers
[7510.90 --> 7514.50]  to have to dig through all these different videos.
[7514.50 --> 7515.92]  You don't want your nine videos?
[7516.36 --> 7516.52]  Yeah.
[7516.58 --> 7516.82]  No.
[7517.02 --> 7517.36]  What do you mean?
[7517.36 --> 7518.02]  What?
[7518.14 --> 7523.04]  Because every one of the like following videos is just going to be all the graphs you just
[7523.04 --> 7525.62]  looked at with one more data point on it.
[7525.62 --> 7530.68]  So we made the decision when we saw this to do one review video.
[7530.76 --> 7531.50]  What a Terry move.
[7531.56 --> 7532.60]  Of the new super lineup.
[7532.90 --> 7533.46]  Thank you.
[7534.44 --> 7536.00]  It wasn't just my decision.
[7536.10 --> 7537.24]  We talked about it as a team.
[7537.50 --> 7537.68]  Cool.
[7537.68 --> 7540.32]  We just looked at it and we went, this is absurd.
[7540.32 --> 7545.70]  Maybe, you know, if we have time, we'll do a couple of them on short circuit, but no,
[7545.76 --> 7547.82]  we're going to do our review of super.
[7548.26 --> 7550.24]  You guys can just watch one video.
[7551.54 --> 7553.30]  You'll know everything you need to know about super.
[7553.36 --> 7554.50]  The super 4,000.
[7554.50 --> 7555.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[7555.78 --> 7556.28]  Sounds cooler.
[7556.50 --> 7556.62]  Yeah.
[7556.72 --> 7557.90]  No, just, just ridiculous.
[7558.16 --> 7564.68]  So instead you guys got the, you know, how we're parallelizing our GPU benchmarking video,
[7564.68 --> 7566.52]  which is going to be super cool.
[7566.96 --> 7567.56]  Super cool.
[7567.66 --> 7567.88]  Get it.
[7568.20 --> 7574.70]  Because, and you won't necessarily see it on the super review here, but in future we are
[7574.70 --> 7582.58]  going to be able to hopefully massively increase the number of fresh results that we can have
[7582.58 --> 7583.48]  on our benchmark charts.
[7584.50 --> 7589.34]  Because as you guys know, we retest as long as there isn't a new driver.
[7590.14 --> 7590.76]  What was that?
[7590.82 --> 7591.26]  Did you hear that?
[7591.54 --> 7591.70]  Yeah.
[7592.88 --> 7595.58]  I opened a video on YouTube and I guess it was still piped through.
[7595.76 --> 7595.94]  Cool.
[7596.34 --> 7596.56]  Okay.
[7596.66 --> 7599.48]  The point is, okay.
[7599.94 --> 7600.22]  Okay.
[7601.10 --> 7601.56]  We're muted?
[7601.84 --> 7602.80]  No, the video.
[7603.04 --> 7603.14]  Yeah.
[7603.30 --> 7603.52]  It's fine.
[7603.92 --> 7607.94]  The point is that we are, so we're able to provide fresh testing data and we'll be able
[7607.94 --> 7609.34]  to provide so much more.
[7609.34 --> 7612.98]  So as long as there, unless, as long as there.
[7614.50 --> 7614.76]  No, no, no.
[7614.88 --> 7618.48]  Unless there hasn't been a driver update at all.
[7618.68 --> 7620.22]  No OS updates, no driver updates.
[7620.22 --> 7624.52]  We retest and we'll be able to do that with a much, much wider pipe.
[7624.76 --> 7630.48]  With the three CPUs that we have found are within, I think it ended up being like 0.25%
[7630.48 --> 7634.56]  of each other in productivity.
[7634.74 --> 7635.36]  It doesn't matter.
[7635.44 --> 7636.12]  It's in the video.
[7636.32 --> 7637.06]  Speaking of which, yeah.
[7637.06 --> 7637.48]  I don't need to memorize.
[7637.48 --> 7642.28]  You should watch that video too, because you're talking about GPU testing, but the CPU testing
[7642.28 --> 7643.44]  video was sick.
[7644.06 --> 7644.42]  No, no, no.
[7644.54 --> 7645.82]  That's for GPU testing.
[7646.16 --> 7647.10]  Oh, it's the same thing.
[7647.12 --> 7647.28]  Yeah.
[7647.40 --> 7648.16]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[7648.20 --> 7648.94]  It's not the same thing.
[7649.14 --> 7650.98]  No, I meant we're talking about the same video.
[7651.00 --> 7651.94]  We're talking about the same video.
[7651.94 --> 7654.30]  And a lot of people misunderstood that.
[7655.84 --> 7660.10]  We are validating CPUs that are...
[7660.10 --> 7661.22]  The intro explains it pretty well.
[7661.26 --> 7661.96]  It's just a long video.
[7662.58 --> 7670.76]  Nearly identical to each other, so that when we are doing GPU testing, we can test three
[7670.76 --> 7672.76]  GPUs at a time.
[7672.86 --> 7673.04]  Yeah.
[7673.22 --> 7675.70]  Instead of one GPU at a time per bench.
[7675.70 --> 7679.00]  Because if your standardization bench has a delta of, what was it, 8% or something?
[7679.34 --> 7680.26]  I don't remember what the percentage was.
[7680.26 --> 7684.00]  It was as much as 8%, and I think that was in Factorio or something like that.
[7684.18 --> 7686.52]  If it has that much of a delta, then all your results are screwed.
[7687.20 --> 7687.32]  Yes.
[7687.32 --> 7690.00]  So you need similar platforms for standardization.
[7690.22 --> 7695.80]  And so a lot of people seemed really confused by that video.
[7695.80 --> 7700.80]  I remember seeing one bit of feedback on it that we should...
[7700.80 --> 7703.34]  Oh, man.
[7703.86 --> 7708.42]  I forget what it was, but it was basically like, no, you should just rerun the benchmark
[7708.42 --> 7709.20]  more times.
[7709.20 --> 7710.98]  And I'm like, no, no, no.
[7711.08 --> 7712.38]  We already do that.
[7712.82 --> 7713.34]  This is...
[7713.34 --> 7714.42]  That's not what...
[7714.42 --> 7716.62]  That is not what we're talking about at all.
[7716.72 --> 7722.82]  We already do multiple runs, and then the outliers go away, and then the median or mean
[7722.82 --> 7723.20]  or whatever.
[7723.32 --> 7725.46]  We have smart people who do that stuff.
[7726.30 --> 7726.78]  Yeah.
[7726.84 --> 7727.76]  Really cool video.
[7728.74 --> 7731.76]  That kind of thing doesn't get a lot of views, but what it is, it's foundational.
[7731.76 --> 7737.18]  So when the lab's website is fully launched, when we start to populate it with articles,
[7737.18 --> 7740.74]  this is what we're going to be able to kind of point people to and go, okay, yeah, this
[7740.74 --> 7746.58]  is the rigor that is going on behind the scenes so that when you guys just see a graph on the
[7746.58 --> 7749.14]  lab's website, you'll know it's good to go.
[7749.22 --> 7750.98]  And in a way, I'm actually...
[7750.98 --> 7754.94]  I'm really looking forward to the lab's website because there's going to be so much less possibility
[7754.94 --> 7755.62]  for human error.
[7756.40 --> 7761.70]  Like, even in that video, after all the QC, there were, I think, two bars that were...
[7761.70 --> 7762.68]  Oh, because you can update it.
[7762.68 --> 7763.24]  It was mislabeled.
[7763.30 --> 7767.66]  One of them was 1%, and one of them said 1% when it was supposed to be averages, and
[7767.66 --> 7769.22]  it was supposed to be 1%.
[7769.22 --> 7774.16]  But when everything's coming straight out of the results database, and the graphs are
[7774.16 --> 7778.78]  just automatically generated, we don't have to worry about human input creating graphical
[7778.78 --> 7779.34]  assets.
[7779.52 --> 7779.70]  Yeah.
[7780.02 --> 7780.52]  That'd be nice.
[7780.80 --> 7781.80]  It's going to be so good.
[7781.88 --> 7783.46]  There could still be issues with...
[7783.46 --> 7784.12]  Anyways, whatever.
[7784.48 --> 7786.62]  Nothing is infallible.
[7786.80 --> 7787.02]  Yeah.
[7787.18 --> 7787.98]  But it'll be nice.
[7788.10 --> 7790.90]  But there'll be less human intervention, which is...
[7790.90 --> 7794.86]  And with the site, at least, even if there are still issues, we can update it.
[7795.84 --> 7798.64]  A lot of people asked, and this is a question that's coming up here.
[7798.94 --> 7800.92]  Why not just force the clock speed?
[7801.98 --> 7802.90]  Do you do that?
[7804.40 --> 7806.02]  Do you run your computer like that?
[7808.52 --> 7808.96]  No?
[7809.26 --> 7809.50]  Oh.
[7809.50 --> 7813.50]  It's actually a surprisingly unrealistic thing in current year.
[7813.98 --> 7814.20]  Yep.
[7815.34 --> 7815.86]  100%.
[7815.86 --> 7820.88]  So, no, we think it's worth the work of making sure that we're going to be able to
[7820.88 --> 7824.70]  run the system the way that you would run the system.
[7825.06 --> 7834.92]  So, that's why when it was time to get over 10 CPUs, we went for a modern top-tier chip
[7834.92 --> 7841.62]  because we want to see what the maximum difference that we can see in these GPUs is, assuming
[7841.62 --> 7844.54]  that we can reduce the other system bottlenecks as much as we can.
[7845.10 --> 7848.28]  And we spent the time testing it to make sure that we have consistency.
[7848.56 --> 7850.44]  We're going to have to continue to revalidate.
[7850.58 --> 7853.54]  And with every new platform, we're going to have to do this process again.
[7855.72 --> 7856.82]  But you guys are worth it.
[7857.38 --> 7858.22]  You guys are worth it.
[7858.24 --> 7859.32]  These things take time, man.
[7859.32 --> 7864.10]  I think a lot of people are looking at the slow progress in the lab going like,
[7864.26 --> 7866.56]  oh, yeah, you know, like, why is it so slow?
[7867.02 --> 7868.76]  You know, why were there mistakes?
[7868.76 --> 7869.78]  Science and engineering takes time, man.
[7869.78 --> 7873.26]  And it's just like, guys, because there's always going to be a little bit of learning
[7873.26 --> 7873.84]  as we go.
[7874.00 --> 7874.14]  Yeah.
[7874.24 --> 7875.60]  And these things take time.
[7877.62 --> 7877.94]  Yeah.
[7878.00 --> 7879.04]  It's going to keep getting better, though.
[7879.70 --> 7881.02]  That, I can promise you.
[7881.62 --> 7882.48]  It's going to keep getting better.
[7883.40 --> 7883.74]  Oh, yeah.
[7883.84 --> 7884.56]  It was a great video.
[7886.06 --> 7886.88]  It was fun.
[7887.26 --> 7889.02]  Doesn't get a lot of views, that kind of thing.
[7889.14 --> 7890.34]  But that's what it is.
[7890.62 --> 7890.94]  Unfortunately.
[7891.26 --> 7891.66]  That's okay.
[7891.70 --> 7893.06]  We're just going to do it because we care.
[7893.06 --> 7897.24]  And at the end of the day, if those kinds of videos just don't get views, then that's fine.
[7897.24 --> 7897.88]  We'll have the website.
[7899.22 --> 7903.86]  But we still want everything we do to have this foundation.
[7904.58 --> 7906.24]  That's what we are building towards.
[7906.34 --> 7909.80]  That's the vision from our chief optometrist.
[7913.40 --> 7915.00]  I still like chief eyeball officer.
[7915.10 --> 7917.14]  But anyways, Disney's holodeck.
[7917.14 --> 7921.68]  Disney has unveiled a working model of what they're calling the world's first multi-person,
[7921.86 --> 7924.94]  omnidirectional, modular, expandable treadmill floor.
[7925.10 --> 7925.32]  Okay.
[7925.32 --> 7930.82]  I intentionally have not watched this video yet.
[7931.48 --> 7934.46]  Because it sounds too good to be true.
[7935.56 --> 7940.52]  And if I was going to be disappointed, I wanted it to happen in front of y'all.
[7940.66 --> 7942.66]  So this is not actually a this week thing.
[7942.78 --> 7943.76]  I've already seen this.
[7944.02 --> 7945.30]  This is from last week.
[7945.74 --> 7946.94]  But it's sick.
[7947.88 --> 7948.32]  Okay.
[7948.92 --> 7950.18]  That looked amazing.
[7950.74 --> 7951.18]  Yeah.
[7951.18 --> 7955.74]  Are you kidding me?
[7956.30 --> 7956.66]  No.
[7958.74 --> 7959.90]  How does it know?
[7960.52 --> 7961.24]  They also...
[7961.24 --> 7962.24]  Are they just all on bearings?
[7962.34 --> 7963.18]  Like, what am I looking at?
[7963.18 --> 7965.92]  Well, it's always pulling you kind of to the middle-ish.
[7966.00 --> 7967.06]  How do you stand still?
[7967.14 --> 7967.78]  Multiple people.
[7968.68 --> 7969.46]  Shut up.
[7969.46 --> 7970.18]  Multiple people.
[7970.34 --> 7970.84]  One platform.
[7970.84 --> 7978.50]  And you can tell even just by how he stands.
[7978.50 --> 7981.66]  And in an earlier portion of the video, you see him walk into the room.
[7981.66 --> 7990.12]  And some of his natural gait actually makes it look, I think, like it's not working as well as it is.
[7990.30 --> 7991.56]  Just because he's a bit of a shuffler?
[7991.72 --> 7992.86]  A little bit of a shuffler.
[7992.96 --> 7993.18]  Yeah.
[7993.26 --> 7995.48]  Which makes you think that it's maybe not doing as well.
[7995.54 --> 7997.80]  But you see him walking on normal floor beforehand.
[7997.92 --> 7999.72]  And you can kind of see that happening.
[8000.34 --> 8002.58]  I think it's incredibly impressive.
[8003.04 --> 8004.30]  People say, can you run?
[8004.66 --> 8008.36]  I don't think there's visual evidence of that.
[8008.40 --> 8009.62]  But I think they say that you can.
[8009.90 --> 8011.70]  They have a really, really cool demo.
[8011.70 --> 8012.14]  He talks about doing dance moves.
[8012.44 --> 8012.66]  Yeah.
[8012.78 --> 8014.62]  They have a really cool demo somewhere in the video.
[8014.84 --> 8014.96]  Yeah.
[8014.96 --> 8015.30]  That's okay.
[8015.36 --> 8016.28]  You guys should go watch it.
[8016.62 --> 8019.80]  Are you talking about him sitting on the chair and them rolling him around on it?
[8019.92 --> 8020.32]  Yes.
[8020.86 --> 8021.72]  What the heck?
[8021.72 --> 8023.78]  So that's at like four minutes and 30.
[8023.98 --> 8024.30]  Yeah.
[8024.62 --> 8025.70]  Go check out the video.
[8025.70 --> 8031.96]  They also show not even a person, which I think is incredibly interesting.
[8032.10 --> 8034.34]  I think it's like a teaser at the end or something.
[8034.40 --> 8035.04]  I don't remember what it is.
[8035.28 --> 8036.44]  But they show and you should watch it.
[8036.66 --> 8039.36]  When he's sitting on the chair, they're like whipping it around.
[8039.48 --> 8042.90]  He's moving very fast, which is also interesting.
[8043.32 --> 8046.94]  At one point in time, they just put an Apple box with no one on it.
[8047.00 --> 8048.38]  And it just cruises around on it.
[8048.38 --> 8049.58]  And they make it move.
[8050.58 --> 8051.78]  This is wild, dude.
[8051.78 --> 8055.68]  Which is incredibly interesting for a huge amount of applicants.
[8055.70 --> 8059.92]  Because it's omnidirectional conveyor belt at that point.
[8060.14 --> 8065.96]  I just hope Disney doesn't patent it and then only use it in their parks.
[8066.10 --> 8067.22]  Oh, they're like definitely going to do that.
[8067.58 --> 8070.30]  And then it just never exists anywhere else.
[8070.32 --> 8071.92]  It has applications in other things.
[8072.10 --> 8074.48]  So I suspect they might try to patent it.
[8074.66 --> 8077.56]  But I also suspect they might try to like license it out to other people.
[8077.72 --> 8077.98]  Okay.
[8078.04 --> 8081.92]  Because they talked about how it has applications in a wide variety of things, not just their parks.
[8081.92 --> 8082.24]  Yeah.
[8082.24 --> 8084.14]  So I hope it just doesn't end up.
[8085.02 --> 8086.62]  So there's like one ride.
[8087.00 --> 8087.24]  Yeah.
[8087.74 --> 8089.54]  You know, some Star Wars experience.
[8090.30 --> 8092.48]  And that's the only place it ever exists.
[8092.48 --> 8094.62]  You get like force pulled or something.
[8094.68 --> 8094.88]  Yeah.
[8095.12 --> 8095.28]  Yeah.
[8098.36 --> 8099.74]  Oh my God.
[8099.74 --> 8103.34]  I wasn't done the sentence, guys.
[8103.74 --> 8105.38]  I know they're going to patent it.
[8109.38 --> 8117.42]  I just don't want it to only exist in one theme park experience and then nowhere else.
[8118.06 --> 8118.28]  Okay.
[8118.32 --> 8120.00]  Our last big topic for the week.
[8120.18 --> 8121.78]  Twitter pumps MrBeast video.
[8121.86 --> 8122.74]  This is kind of hilarious.
[8123.28 --> 8124.78]  Who didn't see this coming?
[8124.78 --> 8133.04]  MrBeast recently uploaded a video to Twitter in order to test how many views and how much revenue it could get on the platform.
[8133.70 --> 8148.58]  It seems that Twitter being the, you know, totally fair platform that it is, you know, town square, et cetera, decided to put a thumb on the scale.
[8148.58 --> 8162.24]  Well, MrBeast video was heavily promoted by official Twitter accounts, by Elon Musk himself, and by Twitter's advertising platform as an unlabeled ad.
[8162.82 --> 8163.44]  Very cool.
[8163.72 --> 8172.20]  Many Twitter users complained that the video was absolutely everywhere and that they would sometimes see it again and again while they were scrolling.
[8172.20 --> 8180.50]  It was only obvious that the post was classified as an ad if the user clicked on a drop-down menu, and you can actually see this down below.
[8183.18 --> 8184.16]  Report ad.
[8184.36 --> 8185.22]  Why this ad?
[8186.62 --> 8192.90]  MrBeast made around a quarter million dollars from this video, which he has already allocated to prizes in a giveaway.
[8193.00 --> 8196.30]  I believe he actually announced the winners of the giveaway today.
[8196.78 --> 8200.20]  He gave 10 random followers on Twitter $25,000 each.
[8200.20 --> 8205.54]  So, our discussion question is, what is the point of this?
[8207.28 --> 8214.84]  They gave MrBeast a big hunk of cash that they know is not representative of typical revenue for a video on the site.
[8216.92 --> 8219.66]  I think they were hoping to get away with it?
[8219.76 --> 8225.50]  If Jimmy's future content doesn't perform the same way that this one did, he's not going to keep uploading.
[8225.50 --> 8233.62]  If other creators see you singling out Jimmy and then don't achieve similar results, they're not going to keep uploading.
[8236.18 --> 8236.70]  Yeah.
[8238.20 --> 8238.72]  Yeah.
[8238.86 --> 8242.12]  My assumption is they were hoping they wouldn't notice.
[8242.36 --> 8252.50]  Look, with all of that said, if Twitter can figure this out, if they can be a viable video platform with actual, you know, evergreen content discoverability,
[8252.50 --> 8254.78]  because that's what YouTube does.
[8255.06 --> 8255.22]  Yeah.
[8255.30 --> 8258.74]  That's what YouTube does well that Twitter sucks at.
[8260.04 --> 8261.38]  Pretty much everyone sucks at.
[8261.96 --> 8266.88]  Hey, I'm kind of a video creator.
[8267.32 --> 8270.18]  Like, are we, sorry, I'm sorry, are we talking incremental views?
[8270.72 --> 8272.02]  Like, bigger audience?
[8272.98 --> 8273.32]  Okay.
[8273.92 --> 8274.46]  Sign me up.
[8274.54 --> 8276.24]  There is no competing VOD platform.
[8276.24 --> 8276.88]  But.
[8277.10 --> 8279.76]  So if there was a competing VOD platform, that would be good for everyone.
[8280.00 --> 8280.64]  I hate Twitter.
[8281.14 --> 8281.24]  I hate Twitter.
[8281.24 --> 8286.02]  I hate, I hate, I am on, extensively on record, very much disliking Twitter.
[8286.06 --> 8288.90]  Oh yeah, and it has nothing to do with the chief twit right now.
[8289.00 --> 8289.78]  It doesn't actually.
[8289.82 --> 8290.58]  You've hated it forever.
[8290.58 --> 8291.52]  I've just always hated Twitter.
[8291.76 --> 8294.76]  But, if there was a competing VOD platform.
[8294.94 --> 8295.56]  That was viable.
[8296.18 --> 8296.54]  Yes.
[8297.24 --> 8298.16]  That would be good for everyone.
[8298.64 --> 8302.40]  But it would have to actually be competing, which has been the problem every time.
[8302.64 --> 8302.86]  Yep.
[8302.86 --> 8305.70]  So, like, good luck.
[8305.98 --> 8306.82]  All right, good luck everybody.
[8307.14 --> 8307.16]  Netflix?
[8307.28 --> 8307.66]  That's not.
[8308.48 --> 8310.18]  Yeah, that's a very different thing.
[8310.26 --> 8310.36]  Yeah.
[8310.96 --> 8312.98]  We're talking user-generated content.
[8313.68 --> 8315.78]  I am going to go switch us to Wancho After Dark.
[8316.10 --> 8317.92]  So our little sign on the monitor is finally right.
[8317.94 --> 8318.36]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8318.36 --> 8319.58]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[8319.82 --> 8321.68]  RTX Video HDR AI upscaling?
[8321.94 --> 8323.06]  Oh, yeah, right.
[8323.24 --> 8323.76]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8323.88 --> 8324.12]  Yeah.
[8324.62 --> 8325.54]  I, um.
[8327.28 --> 8327.68]  Ugh.
[8327.82 --> 8329.52]  I don't know if we're going to make a video about it.
[8329.60 --> 8332.60]  I want to, but we have so many projects right now.
[8332.60 --> 8334.32]  It's that post-CES boom.
[8334.48 --> 8334.64]  Yeah.
[8335.36 --> 8339.34]  Um, it looks super cool, but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet.
[8339.92 --> 8344.40]  Basically, what NVIDIA is doing is kind of like what they announced a fairly recent,
[8344.46 --> 8346.24]  I guess, I don't know, it was months ago, was it a year ago?
[8346.32 --> 8346.80]  I don't know, whatever.
[8346.92 --> 8347.52]  A while ago.
[8348.04 --> 8353.46]  Um, kind of like what NVIDIA announced a while ago, where they are able to upscale in real
[8353.46 --> 8357.44]  time video that you are watching on your system if you have an NVIDIA GPU.
[8357.60 --> 8361.14]  It was pretty power-hungry when I first tried it, but it was also really impressive.
[8361.14 --> 8364.42]  Like, 1080p video looked way better.
[8364.60 --> 8366.36]  Like, they could de-block and de-noise.
[8366.92 --> 8375.64]  Um, it, it seemed to be the solution, or a solution to low-qual, low-bit rate streaming
[8375.64 --> 8376.16]  artifacts.
[8376.16 --> 8386.40]  And so this is not the solution, but a solution to the enormous catalog of standard dynamic
[8386.40 --> 8392.68]  range content that exists out there, and getting some kind of investment, or getting some kind
[8392.68 --> 8398.88]  of return out of your investment into an HDR monitor and an HDR-capable system with that
[8398.88 --> 8399.24]  content.
[8399.24 --> 8400.76]  It looks amazing!
[8401.18 --> 8402.02]  Luke, you've got it up there?
[8402.66 --> 8404.54]  Uh, no, I was trying to test something.
[8404.90 --> 8406.80]  Oh, alright, you're doing something else entirely.
[8406.94 --> 8407.70]  Totally off-topic.
[8407.72 --> 8408.44]  No, no, no, no, it wasn't.
[8408.44 --> 8408.50]  It wasn't.
[8408.50 --> 8409.40]  It wasn't off-topic!
[8409.44 --> 8411.70]  Not even focused on hosting a show with me.
[8411.78 --> 8412.60]  It was not off-topic.
[8413.16 --> 8418.62]  There are comments, there are comments about how the HDR video from NVIDIA is not in HDR.
[8418.94 --> 8422.84]  I'm gonna have to beat you especially badly at Super Checks tonight.
[8423.04 --> 8424.18]  You said you wanted to get home early.
[8424.56 --> 8425.68]  Oh, I'm still playing Super Checks.
[8425.70 --> 8427.18]  You just wanted to play Super Checks earlier.
[8427.42 --> 8427.82]  I mean...
[8429.70 --> 8434.42]  But I was trying to figure out if your device doesn't have HDR, can you not select HDR?
[8436.10 --> 8437.48]  I don't think you'd be able to.
[8437.92 --> 8440.94]  If you don't have an HDR display, how is it gonna HDR anything?
[8441.56 --> 8441.70]  Yeah.
[8441.74 --> 8442.68]  That's just not how that works.
[8442.68 --> 8447.04]  So, when this person said that they uploaded it without HDR, I was like, are they actually
[8447.04 --> 8447.38]  right?
[8448.62 --> 8448.96]  I don't know.
[8450.04 --> 8450.92]  I can't tell, though.
[8451.76 --> 8452.60]  But it is what it is.
[8453.20 --> 8454.36]  Okay, so you're looking at it now.
[8454.38 --> 8454.92]  Okay, let's look.
[8455.06 --> 8455.28]  Yeah.
[8456.12 --> 8456.44]  Okay.
[8458.74 --> 8459.54]  Well, that's...
[8459.54 --> 8460.54]  That's a terrible example.
[8460.60 --> 8462.32]  Yeah, that original video looks like crap.
[8462.40 --> 8463.64]  That could look way better in SDR.
[8466.38 --> 8466.70]  Okay.
[8467.32 --> 8469.60]  I mean, yeah, okay, it's boosting the highlights a bit.
[8469.94 --> 8471.20]  Dark scenes in SDR can be difficult.
[8471.20 --> 8473.22]  Dark scenes in HDR can be difficult to watch.
[8473.48 --> 8473.54]  Yeah.
[8473.58 --> 8474.00]  So, let's see.
[8474.06 --> 8474.38]  Let's see.
[8474.46 --> 8474.80]  Let's see.
[8475.02 --> 8475.22]  Let's see.
[8475.28 --> 8476.14]  This is a game, too.
[8476.26 --> 8476.62]  Interesting.
[8476.62 --> 8476.74]  Interesting.
[8478.50 --> 8478.94]  Interesting.
[8479.26 --> 8479.54]  I...
[8479.54 --> 8479.74]  Ooh.
[8480.54 --> 8485.20]  Could it just transform absolutely everything on your screen into HDR?
[8485.70 --> 8486.14]  Wow.
[8486.28 --> 8488.56]  Would that have to be banned in certain competitive games?
[8489.58 --> 8490.50]  I don't know.
[8491.22 --> 8492.64]  That's pretty cool, though.
[8493.64 --> 8495.12]  How does this only have 100,000 views?
[8495.54 --> 8496.30]  This is sick.
[8497.08 --> 8497.48]  I don't know.
[8497.66 --> 8498.02]  Okay.
[8498.10 --> 8498.42]  I don't know.
[8498.46 --> 8499.66]  Maybe we should do a video about it.
[8499.96 --> 8500.52]  I don't know.
[8500.52 --> 8502.06]  The best video you've ever seen.
[8502.14 --> 8503.00]  It's pretty cool, though.
[8503.48 --> 8503.84]  In SDR.
[8504.88 --> 8506.02]  If you turn this feature on.
[8509.84 --> 8512.82]  NVIDIA won't let you enable the HDR setting unless you enable HDR in Windows.
[8512.92 --> 8513.98]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[8513.98 --> 8519.42]  Because your monitor would have to be receiving metadata from your operating system.
[8519.42 --> 8529.48]  Like, all NVIDIA is doing is taking that SDR content you're playing back and interpreting it into HDR metadata that your monitor can understand.
[8532.84 --> 8533.44]  Yeah.
[8533.68 --> 8537.30]  So, I think the comments are probably right.
[8537.74 --> 8541.34]  I don't think they uploaded this video in HDR, which is hilarious.
[8541.34 --> 8544.04]  There's a lot of comments about it.
[8545.02 --> 8546.74]  Kingfish Watch on YouTube said,
[8546.82 --> 8554.70]  Showcasing an AI HDR tone mapping by converting both SDR and HDR samples to SDR is a truly big brain move.
[8555.10 --> 8559.38]  You know what would have worked better, actually, is if they filmed the screen.
[8560.22 --> 8568.66]  Believe it or not, I forget why it works, but you would be able to see the difference more, even if they uploaded it in SDR.
[8568.90 --> 8569.60]  That makes sense.
[8569.60 --> 8572.36]  It, like, does, sort of, I guess.
[8572.46 --> 8572.68]  Yeah.
[8572.74 --> 8573.46]  But, yeah, it's...
[8573.46 --> 8574.20]  It's still weird.
[8574.30 --> 8578.02]  It's mind-breaking math, but no.
[8578.22 --> 8585.82]  An SDR video of the same camera filming an SDR screen and an HDR screen does not look the same.
[8585.94 --> 8586.16]  Yeah.
[8586.56 --> 8588.52]  You can see that the HDR one is better.
[8589.38 --> 8590.70]  Don't ask me why.
[8592.16 --> 8594.26]  I'm gonna go switch this over to Encho after dark day.
[8594.32 --> 8594.70]  Sounds good.
[8595.64 --> 8596.68]  Dan, are you ready to go?
[8596.68 --> 8597.12]  Yeah.
[8599.60 --> 8601.46]  Okay, cool.
[8601.66 --> 8603.64]  I was like, we don't technically know if he's still here.
[8608.64 --> 8609.28]  To bed?
[8609.62 --> 8609.94]  I don't know.
[8610.26 --> 8614.50]  Yeah, he could be pulling one of those things where he, like, works his other job during Land Show.
[8614.68 --> 8614.92]  Oh.
[8614.92 --> 8619.14]  Yeah, the whole thing where you're remote and you just, like, have two jobs or whatever.
[8619.26 --> 8619.56]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8619.56 --> 8621.44]  It's like, and then we, like, we switch over to producer cameras.
[8621.58 --> 8622.92]  Oh, I get to switch the window.
[8622.98 --> 8623.50]  Oh, sorry.
[8623.70 --> 8623.88]  Yeah.
[8624.16 --> 8624.32]  Yeah.
[8624.46 --> 8624.98]  I'm awake.
[8626.86 --> 8627.32]  I'm here.
[8627.48 --> 8627.78]  I'm here.
[8628.16 --> 8628.54]  All right.
[8628.54 --> 8629.32]  What are we up to, Dan?
[8629.32 --> 8632.04]  Oh, geez.
[8632.12 --> 8633.36]  I guess we're doing merch messages, aren't we?
[8633.36 --> 8633.86]  Oh, geez.
[8633.98 --> 8634.48]  Oh, geez.
[8634.54 --> 8635.76]  I guess it's merch message time.
[8635.86 --> 8636.70]  Oh, geez, Linus.
[8636.80 --> 8637.24]  Oh, geez.
[8638.08 --> 8640.30]  You know, I haven't watched the new season without Justin Roiland.
[8640.34 --> 8640.86]  Is it any good?
[8641.06 --> 8641.42]  Does anyone know?
[8642.14 --> 8642.72]  No idea.
[8643.04 --> 8643.64]  Oh, okay, cool.
[8644.50 --> 8647.02]  Well, it just signed me out of the merch message dashboard, so that's awesome.
[8648.30 --> 8648.66]  Cool.
[8649.72 --> 8650.46]  Do you want me to wait?
[8650.94 --> 8651.22]  Nope.
[8652.50 --> 8652.86]  Okay.
[8652.86 --> 8653.84]  Hey, DLL.
[8653.84 --> 8661.22]  How has it not already pulled an Icarus?
[8662.08 --> 8664.76]  At this point, we're just rebuilding it better than before.
[8666.00 --> 8666.84]  I mean...
[8666.84 --> 8667.52]  So it's...
[8667.52 --> 8669.72]  It's also a Theseus?
[8669.72 --> 8670.04]  More wax.
[8673.20 --> 8675.18]  And to be clear, that's...
[8675.18 --> 8676.68]  We put reinforcements in the wax.
[8677.12 --> 8679.10]  That's not on Labs.
[8679.10 --> 8680.02]  You got Theseus.
[8680.18 --> 8681.12]  You got Icarus.
[8681.54 --> 8682.58]  Yeah, all the Uses.
[8682.58 --> 8684.82]  Yeah, that's not on Labs.
[8684.98 --> 8688.36]  There's a lot of factors that played into everything.
[8689.08 --> 8692.72]  But the reality of it is, we're just going to keep doing our thing, guys.
[8693.18 --> 8695.72]  We're going to keep improving, and you guys are going to see it,
[8695.82 --> 8699.18]  and you're either going to accept it, or you're going to put your fingers in your ears,
[8699.28 --> 8701.68]  and you're like, I can't see this, I can't see this.
[8702.44 --> 8703.46]  The choice is yours.
[8703.46 --> 8711.78]  Do you think that the Intel plants in Ohio will eventually make their prices more user-friendly?
[8712.26 --> 8717.70]  Also, how crazy is it that them and Google have decided to start focusing on expansion in Ohio?
[8717.70 --> 8721.26]  I mean, it's probably cheap.
[8722.38 --> 8727.02]  I mean, Micron has demonstrated that you can build a tech hub anywhere.
[8727.40 --> 8731.36]  We did that facility tour in Idaho, of all places.
[8731.76 --> 8733.00]  So what's Idaho known for?
[8733.38 --> 8733.68]  Chips?
[8734.36 --> 8735.54]  And chips.
[8735.54 --> 8740.00]  And it's not like they don't have super smart people there,
[8740.02 --> 8743.94]  and it's not like the people there aren't pragmatic, intelligent people who are like,
[8744.08 --> 8747.86]  hmm, well, I could work in Silicon Valley,
[8748.66 --> 8754.74]  where I spend, you know, however many tens of thousands of dollars a year on housing,
[8755.30 --> 8758.28]  or I could live in buttf**k Idaho,
[8758.28 --> 8761.66]  and spend basically nothing on housing,
[8761.66 --> 8764.98]  but still have my big penis tech salary.
[8766.00 --> 8767.04]  Gee, let me think.
[8767.68 --> 8768.74]  And so I think that...
[8768.74 --> 8770.08]  Idaho's also, like, beautiful, isn't it?
[8770.10 --> 8773.58]  If you have the kind of pull that an Intel and a Google might,
[8774.02 --> 8777.66]  then you can basically make a tech hub.
[8778.14 --> 8779.92]  You kind of decide where it is.
[8780.14 --> 8782.40]  So, yeah, it makes a ton of sense to me.
[8782.40 --> 8788.54]  Linus, in Riley's tech upgrade,
[8788.68 --> 8792.20]  you started talking about a closet PC you once had,
[8792.54 --> 8795.14]  but got sidetracked by Rocket League hype.
[8795.50 --> 8796.56]  Can you finish that anecdote?
[8797.24 --> 8798.86]  That really was the whole thing.
[8799.02 --> 8801.60]  I had it so that when I tucked in my chair,
[8802.20 --> 8804.48]  my whole closet, it was like a two-door,
[8804.66 --> 8806.76]  like accordion-style door closet,
[8807.24 --> 8810.40]  and it would close so that if I optimistically
[8810.40 --> 8813.40]  ever brought a girl into my room...
[8813.40 --> 8815.38]  Never happened.
[8816.32 --> 8818.28]  There would be no gaming PC.
[8819.40 --> 8821.62]  I mean, I'd still have a cringe futon.
[8823.04 --> 8824.12]  Oh, man.
[8824.38 --> 8826.84]  Yeah, my high school bedroom was not a cool kid bedroom.
[8830.34 --> 8830.90]  Yeah.
[8831.68 --> 8836.06]  Hey, DLL, Linus, with the recent Quick Bits slip-up.
[8836.24 --> 8838.64]  Have you ever considered that not embracing the phrase
[8838.64 --> 8841.64]  could be detrimental to the TechLinked and Gamelink brands?
[8842.56 --> 8844.18]  Also, thanks for the quality tools.
[8844.94 --> 8847.60]  I don't even remember how the whole thing started.
[8847.74 --> 8849.64]  Maybe I thought it was just, like, arbitrary
[8849.64 --> 8851.62]  having some of the titles called something
[8851.62 --> 8853.22]  and some of them not called something,
[8853.46 --> 8857.50]  or maybe they used to always call them something different
[8857.50 --> 8859.32]  back in the day before they standardize.
[8859.32 --> 8860.20]  I don't even know.
[8860.32 --> 8863.08]  But if anything, I think it's better for the TechLinked,
[8863.08 --> 8866.18]  Gamelink brand that I continue to refuse to say it
[8866.18 --> 8869.20]  because they have a lot of fun trying to get me to say it.
[8869.24 --> 8870.80]  And I have a lot of fun not saying it.
[8870.90 --> 8872.60]  So, no, I think we'll keep it up.
[8872.78 --> 8873.48]  And no problem.
[8873.60 --> 8874.66]  Enjoy your quality tools.
[8876.48 --> 8878.68]  I recently went shopping for a mouse
[8878.68 --> 8881.42]  and hated the experience because I want the best one.
[8881.82 --> 8884.62]  How would the experience be for comparing peripherals
[8884.62 --> 8885.62]  on the lab's website?
[8888.80 --> 8889.76]  We're going to have to figure that out.
[8889.86 --> 8892.08]  Yeah, we're going to have a lot of work to do on that.
[8892.54 --> 8894.46]  Some of it's going to be charts and graphs.
[8894.58 --> 8897.84]  If we can do things more visually, I mean, that's what we are.
[8897.92 --> 8898.74]  We're a media company.
[8898.86 --> 8900.02]  We're going to do our best with it.
[8900.08 --> 8901.98]  But I think what you're going to see at the beginning
[8901.98 --> 8905.00]  is minimum viable product,
[8905.00 --> 8906.90]  which is going to be charts and graphs and text.
[8906.90 --> 8911.70]  And then over time, we're going to try to expand on that
[8911.70 --> 8914.18]  slash utilize the lab's data
[8914.18 --> 8916.32]  to put together more compelling video content
[8916.32 --> 8917.62]  that we think you guys will really enjoy.
[8917.86 --> 8920.66]  We shot a video today that I'm really excited about.
[8922.14 --> 8923.34]  Okay, if you're not Canadian,
[8923.58 --> 8924.78]  you won't have heard of these guys.
[8924.78 --> 8929.66]  But Princess Auto is basically the harbor freight of Canada.
[8930.10 --> 8935.74]  It's like where you go to get a $3 socket set, you know?
[8936.90 --> 8938.54]  It might be a little more than that.
[8938.70 --> 8939.92]  And so we were there.
[8939.92 --> 8941.98]  We were there picking up something
[8941.98 --> 8944.04]  because we needed some cheap something.
[8944.82 --> 8947.28]  And something caught our eye.
[8949.70 --> 8951.06]  I thought it'd be a little bit more.
[8951.16 --> 8952.00]  And it is a little bit more.
[8952.08 --> 8953.80]  But it's not as much more as I expected.
[8953.92 --> 8954.38]  It's $10.
[8954.88 --> 8955.72]  Yeah, there you go.
[8956.18 --> 8957.34]  For deep ones, too.
[8957.46 --> 8958.28]  Yeah, exactly.
[8958.40 --> 8959.06]  That's what I'm talking about.
[8959.40 --> 8960.38]  Princess Auto, baby.
[8960.50 --> 8961.70]  And that's $10 Canadian.
[8962.30 --> 8962.54]  Yeah.
[8962.64 --> 8963.92]  So that's about $7 US.
[8963.92 --> 8967.52]  So I'm really not that far off.
[8967.52 --> 8968.20]  No, not really.
[8968.34 --> 8969.36]  Okay, it's more than double.
[8969.76 --> 8970.48]  But we're talking $4.
[8970.84 --> 8971.06]  Yeah.
[8971.56 --> 8974.34]  So anyway, Princess Auto.
[8975.30 --> 8976.86]  We were there picking up something.
[8976.86 --> 8983.88]  And someone snapped a picture of what looks like a razor display.
[8984.58 --> 8986.22]  Whole bunch of peripherals.
[8987.66 --> 8992.50]  Upon closer inspection, the brand is in fact not snake themed,
[8992.74 --> 8994.54]  but rather dart frog.
[8995.90 --> 8999.06]  So we bought them all, obviously.
[8999.06 --> 9009.26]  And I think this video is really cool because it's a perfect example of what we want this kind of content to be.
[9009.74 --> 9011.68]  Hey, here's something you might want to know about.
[9011.74 --> 9018.88]  Whether it's a diamond in the rough power supply or a motherboard that actually impacts performance.
[9018.88 --> 9026.38]  You know, finding interesting stories and not just doing your basic YouTuber reaction,
[9026.52 --> 9028.14]  but also backing it up with hard data.
[9028.30 --> 9033.20]  So it has a combination of what would be like a classic LTT unboxing slash experiential video
[9033.20 --> 9040.32]  with labs data that helps to quantify what it is that we're seeing and what we're feeling.
[9040.70 --> 9041.50]  Really cool video.
[9041.58 --> 9042.24]  It'll be coming in a while.
[9043.18 --> 9044.02]  Just shot today.
[9044.08 --> 9045.06]  So probably be a couple of weeks.
[9046.46 --> 9047.26]  Dart frog.
[9047.26 --> 9047.30]  Dart frog.
[9047.94 --> 9049.22]  Is that the name of the company?
[9049.32 --> 9049.62]  Here, hold on.
[9049.64 --> 9050.16]  I'll be right back.
[9050.56 --> 9052.36]  Do you want to do a merch message while I...
[9052.36 --> 9053.34]  Sure.
[9054.34 --> 9055.28]  You got one for me, Dan?
[9056.88 --> 9058.28]  For you specifically?
[9058.58 --> 9059.26]  Let's see.
[9059.56 --> 9060.64]  Just a general one.
[9060.76 --> 9060.90]  I know.
[9061.84 --> 9062.20]  Hello.
[9062.38 --> 9067.76]  I met you at LTX and asked how your fitness journey was going.
[9068.20 --> 9069.42]  How's it been since then?
[9069.42 --> 9071.42]  And where are your fitness goals for 2024?
[9071.76 --> 9072.42]  Still recomping?
[9075.36 --> 9076.50]  Yeah, to be honest.
[9076.50 --> 9082.56]  Not as good as they were, as Dan knows, because I've been complaining to Dan about it.
[9082.90 --> 9085.84]  I got sick for like a really long time.
[9085.98 --> 9087.14]  A very long time.
[9087.38 --> 9090.30]  I was very, very sick for like two weeks.
[9091.26 --> 9094.36]  And I was already upset about the impact from just that.
[9094.60 --> 9097.18]  And then I had this weird...
[9097.18 --> 9098.76]  You might have even noticed it on WAN Show.
[9098.76 --> 9100.10]  Where sometimes...
[9100.10 --> 9104.78]  Something in my throat would just get caught and I couldn't breathe anymore.
[9104.78 --> 9106.02]  And I'd have to clear it.
[9107.62 --> 9110.70]  There was literally, I think, like a month or two of that.
[9111.10 --> 9112.28]  Just on WAN Show.
[9112.34 --> 9113.58]  Because I would start talking emphatically.
[9114.14 --> 9116.26]  And then I'd have to clear it.
[9116.26 --> 9118.02]  And that was scary.
[9118.20 --> 9125.08]  Because a lot of things that I liked doing while I was working out might be a bit of a problem if you very suddenly, unexpectedly couldn't breathe.
[9125.08 --> 9129.10]  So I decided to take time off from that.
[9130.00 --> 9131.84]  I started going again.
[9132.90 --> 9134.62]  I think it was two or three weeks ago.
[9134.74 --> 9138.38]  And then I had to take a break for a curling tournament and some other things.
[9138.46 --> 9140.62]  And now I'll be going again on Tuesday.
[9140.72 --> 9141.62]  So I lost some progress.
[9141.86 --> 9143.78]  But it's been going pretty well.
[9144.48 --> 9148.94]  My goals for the end of the year are not really fixed, though, to be honest.
[9148.94 --> 9151.94]  I do usually like monthly or quarterly style stuff.
[9153.10 --> 9153.40]  Okay.
[9154.54 --> 9155.66]  We're going to play a game.
[9156.20 --> 9156.60]  Okay.
[9160.84 --> 9162.14]  Do I need to close my eyes?
[9163.22 --> 9163.66]  No.
[9163.98 --> 9164.22]  Okay.
[9164.80 --> 9165.06]  Okay.
[9165.84 --> 9168.98]  The game is called Dart Frog or Razor.
[9169.46 --> 9169.94]  Okay.
[9170.46 --> 9170.74]  Okay.
[9174.98 --> 9175.42]  Okay.
[9175.48 --> 9176.54]  Maybe you do need to close your eyes.
[9176.60 --> 9177.22]  Yeah, I thought so.
[9177.32 --> 9177.54]  Okay.
[9177.54 --> 9177.66]  Okay.
[9177.66 --> 9177.94]  Okay.
[9178.10 --> 9180.14]  So all you're allowed to do, you only get a flash.
[9180.44 --> 9181.40]  So like a blink.
[9182.12 --> 9183.10]  An opposite blink.
[9183.20 --> 9183.80]  That's all you get.
[9183.98 --> 9184.84]  An opposite blink?
[9184.94 --> 9185.12]  Yeah.
[9185.12 --> 9185.52]  Oh, okay.
[9185.72 --> 9185.86]  Yeah.
[9185.92 --> 9186.04]  Yeah.
[9186.10 --> 9186.42]  Got it.
[9186.50 --> 9186.68]  Okay.
[9187.08 --> 9187.40]  Okay.
[9189.26 --> 9191.36]  So we'll do A and B.
[9191.66 --> 9191.96]  Okay.
[9192.28 --> 9192.54]  Okay.
[9193.10 --> 9193.36]  Go.
[9194.32 --> 9196.24]  That was a really long flash.
[9196.46 --> 9197.56]  I didn't like see.
[9197.64 --> 9198.64]  I thought it was going to be here.
[9198.76 --> 9199.76]  I really didn't see it properly.
[9199.76 --> 9199.94]  Okay.
[9200.94 --> 9201.26]  Hold on.
[9201.32 --> 9201.54]  Hold on.
[9201.58 --> 9201.86]  Hold on.
[9202.32 --> 9202.64]  Okay.
[9204.30 --> 9204.82]  Here's B.
[9204.82 --> 9207.64]  That was too long.
[9207.74 --> 9208.46]  I looked for too long.
[9209.38 --> 9212.08]  I thought the first one was Razor until you showed me the second box.
[9212.16 --> 9213.58]  And then I looked for too long at the second box.
[9213.66 --> 9213.84]  Okay.
[9213.98 --> 9214.24]  It doesn't.
[9217.26 --> 9217.88]  Dang it, Luke.
[9220.38 --> 9222.32]  Anyway, the point is it's going to be a good video.
[9223.60 --> 9223.92]  Wow.
[9223.92 --> 9224.40]  Don't miss it.
[9224.54 --> 9225.82]  Even from here.
[9225.98 --> 9226.46]  Yeah, I know.
[9227.18 --> 9227.50]  Wow.
[9227.50 --> 9227.78]  Wow.
[9227.78 --> 9228.54]  Yeah, I know.
[9230.80 --> 9231.32]  Wow.
[9232.06 --> 9234.64]  They even, I didn't actually bring this up in the video.
[9235.30 --> 9236.10]  That's crazy.
[9237.40 --> 9243.90]  But do you notice how prominently they put the word laser everywhere on it?
[9244.48 --> 9246.60]  Oh, wow.
[9247.16 --> 9247.68]  Wow.
[9247.90 --> 9249.76]  That's a little, that's a little scummy.
[9250.88 --> 9250.98]  Wow.
[9250.98 --> 9252.14]  Everything about it is scummy.
[9252.48 --> 9253.80]  Laser is very close to razor.
[9254.00 --> 9254.48]  It sure is.
[9254.48 --> 9257.08]  The short frog is very similar to the snake combination.
[9257.36 --> 9257.62]  It sure is.
[9258.72 --> 9259.08]  Yeah.
[9259.80 --> 9260.58]  It'll be a good video.
[9261.04 --> 9266.38]  Honestly, if I hadn't seen them yet, looking at this angle, like here, I wouldn't be able
[9266.38 --> 9266.70]  to tell.
[9266.86 --> 9267.42]  Yeah, I know.
[9267.74 --> 9269.20]  It's like, I can't make out the logo.
[9269.50 --> 9272.20]  And being able to make out the logo is honestly the only way you can tell.
[9272.34 --> 9272.54]  Yeah.
[9272.82 --> 9273.42]  That's wild.
[9273.50 --> 9274.36]  It's going to be a really good video.
[9274.64 --> 9275.34]  Don't miss it, guys.
[9275.64 --> 9276.02]  Wow.
[9279.12 --> 9279.68]  All right.
[9279.80 --> 9280.06]  Dan.
[9280.06 --> 9280.34]  Yeah.
[9280.34 --> 9286.22]  Linus, what do you think of the rumor Intel is going to kill off hyperthreading?
[9287.58 --> 9288.58]  I mean, sure.
[9289.14 --> 9290.44]  I'm not a CPU architect.
[9290.62 --> 9295.04]  If they think that's a good idea, then it's probably not a terrible idea.
[9295.16 --> 9299.06]  If there's other ways that they can deliver the performance their customers expect.
[9299.06 --> 9301.74]  This is another thing.
[9301.82 --> 9303.86]  We've got a video coming on recently.
[9303.86 --> 9306.20]  So we finally covered Meteor Lake.
[9306.92 --> 9309.34]  We look at integrated GPU performance.
[9309.34 --> 9311.38]  We talk about the new core ultra branding.
[9311.70 --> 9316.08]  And one of the things I say, this is not investment advice.
[9316.24 --> 9320.52]  I am not a financial advisor is long-term Intel just took a beating.
[9320.96 --> 9321.40]  Okay.
[9321.48 --> 9322.48]  So I'm going to say it again.
[9322.92 --> 9324.50]  This is not financial advice.
[9325.02 --> 9326.38]  I'm not a financial advisor.
[9327.12 --> 9329.86]  Don't come angrily screaming back if this goes poorly.
[9329.86 --> 9330.72]  Intel just took a beating.
[9330.92 --> 9333.70]  But I love where they're looking long-term.
[9335.06 --> 9337.06]  Because of the iGPU stuff or just in general?
[9337.10 --> 9337.40]  In general.
[9337.58 --> 9342.28]  I don't know if they're going to be a five-bagger or if they're going to lose all your money.
[9342.32 --> 9342.70]  I don't know.
[9342.98 --> 9344.36]  I'm not a financial advisor.
[9344.92 --> 9346.44]  But I talk about this in the video.
[9346.44 --> 9353.82]  I love their first shot at a tiled CPU.
[9353.82 --> 9355.02]  Are they gluing stuff together now?
[9355.08 --> 9356.08]  They're gluing it real good.
[9356.54 --> 9357.58]  Really like it.
[9358.24 --> 9358.70]  Oh boy.
[9360.78 --> 9362.40]  J529 says, I'm buying Boeing.
[9362.48 --> 9363.30]  What do you think, Linus?
[9364.00 --> 9365.94]  I think I'm not a financial advisor.
[9366.40 --> 9367.36]  That's what I think.
[9373.68 --> 9374.12]  Yeah.
[9374.36 --> 9374.60]  Cool.
[9375.00 --> 9375.52]  Anyway, yeah.
[9375.52 --> 9377.54]  If they say, look, we're not going to do hyper-threading.
[9377.66 --> 9380.20]  We're going to do efficient cores or we're going to have these.
[9380.20 --> 9386.76]  Okay, so they have new efficient cores, low power efficient cores that are on like the
[9386.76 --> 9389.70]  SOC tile rather than the compute tile.
[9389.90 --> 9393.90]  And what's really cool about these is they can light these ones up to like handle a Windows
[9393.90 --> 9395.26]  update in the background or whatever.
[9395.82 --> 9399.00]  And they don't even have to have the main cores turn on at all.
[9399.70 --> 9402.54]  Like, okay, not at all is a bit of an overstatement.
[9402.94 --> 9402.96]  But.
[9403.44 --> 9403.90]  That's cool though.
[9403.98 --> 9405.14]  Yeah, it's pretty good for power savings.
[9405.14 --> 9409.98]  To be clear, AMD is still very competitive right now and we're going to see new stuff
[9409.98 --> 9411.96]  from them hopefully in the near-ish future.
[9412.10 --> 9415.38]  I mean, 780M, their mobile GPU has been around for a while.
[9416.54 --> 9418.52]  RDNA4 though, where are you at, dog?
[9419.48 --> 9419.94]  So we'll see.
[9420.42 --> 9420.86]  We'll see.
[9421.22 --> 9421.76]  But I am.
[9421.76 --> 9422.72]  I'm sure they're not down and out.
[9423.08 --> 9425.32]  I am liking where Intel is heading.
[9425.80 --> 9430.46]  I really like their move into contract manufacturing for third parties.
[9430.46 --> 9435.22]  Hi guys.
[9435.54 --> 9440.54]  Will the stubby with black shaft get back into stock or is the notification option more like
[9440.54 --> 9440.98]  a poll?
[9441.40 --> 9442.04]  Thanks for an update.
[9442.86 --> 9444.16]  We've never said never.
[9445.52 --> 9450.34]  I think we've always said not if we can't figure out the quality issues.
[9450.34 --> 9460.46]  With our black finishes.
[9462.66 --> 9464.48]  Okay, to be clear, this is actually a different thing.
[9464.54 --> 9464.94]  I'm just teasing.
[9465.28 --> 9469.96]  This is anodized aluminum and we would not make a screwdriver shaft on something that you
[9469.96 --> 9472.78]  can really torque out of aluminum.
[9473.78 --> 9476.84]  We are still exploring black finish options.
[9476.84 --> 9482.40]  We have not settled on anything that we would consider to be acceptable to bring back black
[9482.40 --> 9483.86]  shafts yet.
[9485.78 --> 9489.80]  Hey, WAN.DLL pronounced D-l-l-l.
[9489.98 --> 9490.68]  I can't see that.
[9491.06 --> 9494.72]  Could you explain how YouTube premium works with monetization on YouTube?
[9494.96 --> 9496.06]  I'm going to make it sound really big.
[9496.60 --> 9503.92]  Basically, just like YouTube shares ad revenue with the creators that you watch, YouTube shares
[9503.92 --> 9506.60]  premium revenue with the creators that you watch.
[9507.08 --> 9508.98]  And it's divvied up according to watch time.
[9509.46 --> 9516.60]  So if you were to watch, say, for example, 100 Cyanide and Happiness one minute videos,
[9516.60 --> 9521.74]  or if you were to sit through a third of a WAN show, we would get half of it and Cyanide
[9521.74 --> 9523.12]  and Happiness would get half of it.
[9523.60 --> 9529.50]  Half of the allocation that YouTube gives to creators, which is either 60 or 70%.
[9529.50 --> 9530.12]  I can't remember.
[9532.54 --> 9535.68]  Are you still using Theo Joe's comment moderation tool?
[9535.86 --> 9536.76]  If so, is it working?
[9537.22 --> 9537.74]  No.
[9539.08 --> 9546.28]  Honestly, right now, most of our comment moderation is me and Chewy, our community coordinator.
[9547.20 --> 9554.78]  It seems to have helped a fair bit that every time I see a porn bot or a spam bot or a spectacularly
[9554.78 --> 9557.60]  stupid person, I'm just shadow banning them.
[9558.00 --> 9560.84]  And I think it's made at least the main channel less of a target.
[9561.02 --> 9564.92]  I definitely see some more dumb f***ery on the sub channels.
[9565.86 --> 9571.82]  But we just didn't, we didn't end up building a process that allowed us to run it forever
[9571.82 --> 9573.70]  and got distracted.
[9574.18 --> 9577.38]  And hopefully YouTube just fixes their stuff at some point.
[9577.72 --> 9581.22]  It's possible that the overall spam is just down on the platform.
[9581.22 --> 9586.36]  And it has nothing to do with any of our moderation, but we definitely do see it and we're definitely
[9586.36 --> 9587.98]  stamping it down whenever we do.
[9588.20 --> 9589.18]  I don't think they'll ever fix it.
[9589.72 --> 9590.22]  Yeah, that's fair.
[9590.32 --> 9592.28]  I think it's going to get worse sooner than it gets better.
[9592.74 --> 9599.40]  I was, a friend of mine linked me a Twitter thread recently, which was a very long Twitter
[9599.40 --> 9603.76]  thread that it took me a while of reading into because I was like, he wouldn't have sent
[9603.76 --> 9604.90]  this to me with no reason.
[9604.96 --> 9606.56]  But he didn't explain why.
[9606.56 --> 9610.78]  He was like, just read this, continue reading through these tweets.
[9610.96 --> 9616.18]  And then eventually I realized it was a back and forth conversation between a very large
[9616.18 --> 9621.48]  amount of fake AI accounts, but they were not promoting anything.
[9621.74 --> 9624.62]  They were just building up account cred.
[9624.82 --> 9625.62]  A conversation.
[9626.22 --> 9628.82]  While they, so, so they were incubating.
[9628.82 --> 9632.44]  And I was like, what the heck?
[9632.68 --> 9637.44]  Because it seems, you know, you know how a lot of AI output text is like too clean.
[9638.52 --> 9640.28]  It's too like kind of generic.
[9640.50 --> 9640.66]  Yeah.
[9640.86 --> 9642.58]  It was all like that.
[9642.78 --> 9645.58]  And the conversation started kind of looping a little bit.
[9645.64 --> 9647.56]  And I was like, what's going on?
[9647.68 --> 9650.44]  Because they're just riffing off of the previous tweets.
[9650.44 --> 9653.84]  And there's realistically only so long that you could really do that and be original.
[9653.84 --> 9656.38]  So they stopped being able to be original.
[9656.64 --> 9657.02]  Right.
[9657.68 --> 9659.40]  And it was just like, whoa.
[9659.78 --> 9666.16]  It was, it was very kind of eerie to read, but yeah.
[9668.10 --> 9669.16]  Anyways, moving on.
[9669.28 --> 9669.60]  Next one.
[9669.68 --> 9673.06]  Good evening, Duke, Lan, and Dynas from Texas.
[9673.54 --> 9675.54]  Can we get an update on backpack returns?
[9675.54 --> 9678.48]  I've been waiting to return mine for over a month now.
[9678.90 --> 9680.98]  Also, how is shipping being handled?
[9680.98 --> 9683.48]  Uh, that's a great question.
[9683.48 --> 9685.72]  And I do not know exactly.
[9686.16 --> 9689.94]  Um, the last thing I want to do is give you any false information.
[9689.94 --> 9698.82]  But what I can do is get Dan to send a follow up and, um, hopefully have an answer for you guys next week.
[9698.92 --> 9699.76]  Dan, can we do that?
[9702.10 --> 9702.50]  Yep.
[9702.58 --> 9704.08]  I'll send a message to Nick.
[9704.42 --> 9709.76]  Or better, if we don't talk about it next week, then hopefully you'll have already heard from our customer care team.
[9709.76 --> 9711.78]  Um, so I won't need to talk about it on land show.
[9711.84 --> 9712.58]  That would be the ideal.
[9716.66 --> 9717.36]  Uh, yeah.
[9717.48 --> 9718.20]  One moment.
[9718.58 --> 9718.90]  Okay.
[9719.14 --> 9719.64]  There we go.
[9720.02 --> 9721.58]  I'll just leave that one there for the second.
[9722.26 --> 9723.64]  Um, hi, LLD.
[9723.80 --> 9725.14]  How do you feel about Cloudflare?
[9725.54 --> 9731.04]  I don't like that they control so much of the internet, but I still use them because their products and prices are good.
[9731.42 --> 9733.38]  Almost free for what I need, actually.
[9733.38 --> 9744.36]  Yeah, honestly, for, for like non-large infrastructure company users, their pricing is insane.
[9744.72 --> 9750.06]  Um, to the point where like not using them for a lot of things is, is just kind of like weird and ill-advised.
[9750.44 --> 9753.84]  Um, we use them fairly heavily for VOD delivery on floatplane.
[9753.84 --> 9765.30]  Um, I could complain about that a lot, um, considering they're kind of like inaction on fixing VOD delivery to, uh, most notably Australia and Germany, but other places as well.
[9765.72 --> 9776.02]  Um, we need to do more to fix that on our end, but what we need to do to fix that on our end is to use more places than just Cloudflare more actively.
[9776.02 --> 9782.80]  Um, which is unfortunate because you would hope that they would just do better at that.
[9783.02 --> 9787.24]  Um, their core product is insanely good.
[9787.74 --> 9793.72]  Um, and, and it's, it's, yeah, I don't even really know what else to say.
[9793.80 --> 9796.42]  Their, their core product is just insanely good.
[9796.44 --> 9797.04]  It works.
[9797.80 --> 9802.28]  Um, the, the fact that they don't have more outages is like wild.
[9802.28 --> 9804.52]  Um, what a crazy company.
[9804.74 --> 9807.00]  Sometimes they can be frustrating to deal with.
[9807.48 --> 9814.44]  Um, I'm not a fan as I've talked on, on WAN show before of calls where you just rotate your person.
[9814.44 --> 9817.72]  That is the representative of that company every once in a while.
[9817.74 --> 9824.36]  And they always want to have onboarding calls and it's really not productive for your company that they just keep cycling people constantly, constantly, constantly, constantly, constantly.
[9824.48 --> 9826.18]  And I wish that wouldn't happen so much.
[9826.18 --> 9834.02]  Um, and I wish they would care more about their side products, but their core product is just wildly good.
[9834.44 --> 9839.56]  Um, and their side products are, are for the most part, pretty solid as well.
[9839.86 --> 9841.60]  Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[9841.60 --> 9860.08]  It's never really great when one company has so much market share in an area, but, um, I will say while that goes poorly in a lot of realms, Cloudflare has seemingly kept the quality of their core product up, uh, quite well.
[9860.24 --> 9861.72]  So I'll give them that.
[9866.12 --> 9866.60]  Hmm.
[9866.60 --> 9867.80]  Let's see what we got here.
[9869.00 --> 9871.66]  Hey, LL minus D picking up another WAN hoodie.
[9872.00 --> 9875.86]  My eight year old son loves the way my WAN hoodie looks and wants to match.
[9876.82 --> 9880.78]  When have you found your kids wanting something just because you had one first?
[9882.18 --> 9883.04]  Every time.
[9884.00 --> 9884.44]  Seriously.
[9884.62 --> 9889.52]  Every single time I pick up my ally, my kids are like, can I play?
[9889.52 --> 9895.58]  And I'm like, I use this maybe a couple times a week.
[9895.78 --> 9898.26]  It sits idle the entire rest of the time.
[9898.32 --> 9899.12]  Just use it.
[9899.28 --> 9903.68]  Just when you, when you have your screen time, just let me know and use it.
[9904.80 --> 9906.98]  They only want it when I'm holding it.
[9907.36 --> 9908.04]  Food too.
[9908.50 --> 9911.54]  Like my kids are never like, oh, can I have a salad?
[9911.80 --> 9917.68]  But if I'm eating Greek salad, they come along, they pick all the tomatoes and all the feta cheese out.
[9917.68 --> 9920.84]  It's like, it's the best part.
[9928.78 --> 9929.18]  Okay.
[9929.30 --> 9930.18]  Let's see what else we got.
[9932.36 --> 9933.10]  Hey, Linus.
[9933.18 --> 9934.86]  Great job promoting screwdriver bits.
[9935.38 --> 9938.64]  And I'm not going to be like, I'm not going to be like, no, don't eat vegetables.
[9940.04 --> 9940.42]  Yes.
[9940.50 --> 9941.70]  Tomato is technically a fruit.
[9942.14 --> 9942.56]  Calm down.
[9942.62 --> 9942.82]  Reddit.
[9944.20 --> 9946.72]  But like a banana is a berry, man.
[9947.68 --> 9948.20]  Sorry.
[9948.20 --> 9949.02]  Sorry, Dan.
[9949.18 --> 9949.66]  Sorry, Dan.
[9950.12 --> 9950.50]  Sorry.
[9950.68 --> 9952.28]  I thought bananas were actually herbs.
[9953.86 --> 9955.18]  That doesn't check out.
[9957.30 --> 9958.10]  Yeah, whatever.
[9958.98 --> 9959.64]  I'm pretty sure it's a berry.
[9959.82 --> 9963.20]  Great job on promoting screwdriver bits.
[9963.46 --> 9966.10]  I just bought all six sets before the price goes up.
[9966.72 --> 9971.84]  Not that this is you, but what's the worst company to threaten price increases as promotions?
[9971.84 --> 9972.44]  Okay.
[9972.52 --> 9979.32]  I curated this, but I couldn't think of one, but I'm sure there's got to be examples of companies being like, here's our big sale.
[9979.66 --> 9980.22]  I guarantee you there is.
[9980.22 --> 9982.54]  You can have the old price before we raise it.
[9982.66 --> 9982.90]  Yeah.
[9983.24 --> 9983.78]  I guarantee you there is.
[9983.78 --> 9984.68]  That's got to be a thing.
[9984.68 --> 9988.28]  Especially like software as a service companies and stuff like that.
[9988.42 --> 9991.16]  Hey, lock in now or we're going to raise the prices.
[9991.28 --> 9991.78]  Ha ha ha.
[9991.84 --> 9992.22]  Got them.
[9994.60 --> 9997.28]  So I was hoping chat could maybe pitch us a few.
[9998.24 --> 9999.18]  Autodesk, all early.
[9999.28 --> 10000.40]  Oh, early access games.
[10000.78 --> 10002.10]  The entire Kickstarter platform.
[10002.32 --> 10002.52]  Okay.
[10002.66 --> 10003.44]  Didn't think of that one.
[10003.52 --> 10003.92]  Pretty good.
[10004.22 --> 10004.82]  That's pretty good.
[10005.20 --> 10006.06]  I came up with that one.
[10006.12 --> 10006.30]  Yay.
[10006.46 --> 10007.80]  That's literally Kickstarter's whole thing.
[10007.90 --> 10008.06]  Yeah.
[10008.64 --> 10011.04]  Well, not really, but that's how most Kickstarters work.
[10012.00 --> 10016.72]  You get it for however much off now, but our actual real price is coming later.
[10016.84 --> 10018.56]  Apparently Disney Plus did it in October.
[10022.14 --> 10023.78]  Chess.com did it a while ago, apparently.
[10028.02 --> 10028.42]  Tesla.
[10028.54 --> 10029.50]  Has Tesla done that?
[10031.42 --> 10032.52]  Did they do that?
[10032.60 --> 10035.80]  That one year when they were trying to hit a target before end of year?
[10035.92 --> 10036.36]  I have no idea.
[10038.78 --> 10040.28]  That does sound kind of familiar.
[10040.42 --> 10040.96]  MetaQuest 2.
[10041.66 --> 10042.02]  Okay.
[10042.08 --> 10043.66]  There's lots of examples of this.
[10043.74 --> 10043.86]  Yeah.
[10043.88 --> 10044.48]  This is totally a thing.
[10044.52 --> 10044.68]  Yeah.
[10044.80 --> 10045.44]  Super interesting.
[10045.64 --> 10047.14]  A lot of ISPs apparently do it.
[10047.48 --> 10047.66]  Okay.
[10047.78 --> 10049.98]  Internet access should only go down in price.
[10050.08 --> 10050.96]  That's stupid.
[10051.94 --> 10052.76]  Hulu apparently.
[10053.10 --> 10053.52]  Oh, wow.
[10053.62 --> 10053.78]  Wow.
[10053.84 --> 10056.38]  You guys are coming up with lots of examples.
[10056.56 --> 10056.76]  Okay.
[10056.84 --> 10057.06]  Cool.
[10057.14 --> 10057.86]  So this is a thing.
[10058.60 --> 10059.04]  All right.
[10059.48 --> 10059.84]  Dan.
[10061.54 --> 10062.90]  Hey, Luke and Linus.
[10062.90 --> 10064.12]  And possibly Jake.
[10064.12 --> 10064.90]  Oh, yeah.
[10064.90 --> 10067.26]  Oh, yeah.
[10068.06 --> 10074.40]  Will you do another month challenge if or when Battlemage comes out?
[10075.60 --> 10076.12]  Cheers.
[10077.12 --> 10078.86]  Do you want to redo the ARC challenge?
[10078.98 --> 10083.94]  Given that you are currently experiencing GP related crashes and it is making your...
[10083.94 --> 10085.94]  Oh, I'm experiencing all related crashes.
[10086.04 --> 10086.46]  That's fair.
[10088.36 --> 10089.82]  Nice computer, Linus.
[10093.00 --> 10094.32]  You know what else is crashing?
[10094.90 --> 10096.54]  The NCIX SignPZ.
[10096.78 --> 10098.62]  It blue screens like once a day.
[10098.98 --> 10099.92]  Need to solve it.
[10099.92 --> 10101.80]  I have mem test right?
[10102.04 --> 10102.28]  Okay.
[10102.44 --> 10103.72]  I already turned off Expo.
[10104.02 --> 10106.38]  I've already turned off like S3.
[10106.88 --> 10112.10]  I decided to run mem test overnight because at least some of the errors I've been getting
[10112.10 --> 10115.06]  are reporting something that sounds like probably memory.
[10115.16 --> 10115.38]  Yeah.
[10115.38 --> 10115.46]  Yeah.
[10116.72 --> 10119.82]  And it defaults to my far left monitor.
[10119.90 --> 10120.44]  I have three monitors.
[10120.70 --> 10120.94]  Yeah.
[10121.02 --> 10122.18]  It defaults to my far left monitor.
[10122.26 --> 10122.50]  Whatever.
[10122.68 --> 10123.16]  Run the test.
[10123.28 --> 10123.62]  Go to bed.
[10123.80 --> 10124.38]  Wake up in the morning.
[10124.56 --> 10125.56]  All my monitors are black.
[10125.96 --> 10126.22]  Mm-hmm.
[10126.30 --> 10128.14]  Like, oh, okay.
[10129.22 --> 10130.80]  Shake mouse, keyboard stuff.
[10130.90 --> 10133.92]  See, like, did it boot into Windows somehow and go to sleep?
[10133.92 --> 10136.50]  Or does mem test, like, screen off at a certain point?
[10136.96 --> 10137.84]  Nothing's responding.
[10138.02 --> 10138.38]  I'm like...
[10139.66 --> 10141.58]  So it crashed.
[10142.00 --> 10142.34]  Okay.
[10142.86 --> 10143.64]  Power off computer.
[10143.80 --> 10144.88]  Power computer back on.
[10145.78 --> 10146.18]  Okay.
[10146.32 --> 10146.56]  Crap.
[10146.62 --> 10147.56]  It booted into mem test again.
[10147.66 --> 10147.88]  Whatever.
[10148.32 --> 10148.78]  Or no.
[10149.06 --> 10150.00]  Nothing happens.
[10150.98 --> 10151.38]  Yeah.
[10151.44 --> 10151.54]  No.
[10151.58 --> 10152.50]  It booted into mem test again.
[10152.58 --> 10152.70]  Okay.
[10152.72 --> 10153.16]  Turn it off.
[10153.24 --> 10153.76]  Unplug the USB.
[10153.90 --> 10154.06]  Whatever.
[10154.20 --> 10154.80]  Get back into Windows.
[10155.24 --> 10158.38]  Oh, my left screen didn't turn on.
[10158.64 --> 10159.44]  What's happening?
[10159.86 --> 10160.16]  Oh.
[10161.54 --> 10167.10]  Emma tried to very nicely save my screen from burning and turned the monitor off.
[10167.24 --> 10167.46]  Oh, nice.
[10167.70 --> 10169.28]  So I just turned it off.
[10169.38 --> 10171.32]  So I have no idea what happened to the test.
[10171.58 --> 10171.70]  Cool.
[10172.36 --> 10172.76]  So.
[10172.76 --> 10175.52]  I ran it before I left.
[10175.82 --> 10178.20]  So hopefully when I get home, I'll know if there's memory problems or not.
[10180.40 --> 10180.76]  So.
[10183.10 --> 10184.82]  I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler.
[10185.64 --> 10185.78]  But.
[10185.78 --> 10187.74]  Probably shouldn't tell them.
[10187.90 --> 10188.62]  I shouldn't tell them.
[10188.62 --> 10188.98]  Okay.
[10189.18 --> 10195.88]  Make sure you watch the video on his new build because I think the title is going to be something
[10195.88 --> 10198.28]  like I have to get out of this contract or something like that.
[10198.36 --> 10199.42]  It doesn't get you out of the contract.
[10200.18 --> 10200.62]  Anyway.
[10200.84 --> 10202.40]  The point is that.
[10202.40 --> 10211.24]  Let's just say his troubles may be related to the 10 CPU test video we just did.
[10211.88 --> 10212.08]  Yeah.
[10212.18 --> 10213.46]  I've been wondering that actually.
[10213.46 --> 10213.90]  Hmm.
[10216.54 --> 10217.80]  Hopefully that's not it.
[10217.92 --> 10218.36]  Hey, Dan.
[10218.36 --> 10221.62]  Yeah, sure.
[10224.42 --> 10225.30]  This is weird.
[10225.74 --> 10230.58]  Years ago, you talked about becoming a real company that would survive without you and
[10230.58 --> 10231.00]  Yvonne.
[10231.66 --> 10232.52]  Inheritance tax.
[10232.62 --> 10233.42]  Was it the problem?
[10233.84 --> 10235.38]  You hope to have a good plan someday.
[10235.54 --> 10235.98]  Do you now?
[10236.26 --> 10237.04]  Appreciate you guys.
[10237.04 --> 10244.10]  Um, I've talked about this a number of times, pretty much every time I do, it gets misunderstood
[10244.10 --> 10245.96]  or misconstrued in some way.
[10246.28 --> 10253.36]  Remember backpack warranty gate when I went on that very, very long thing where I was
[10253.36 --> 10258.90]  like, well, anything that we set up should be something that is resilient enough that it
[10258.90 --> 10262.90]  is not just based on the goodwill of, you know, trust me, bro.
[10262.90 --> 10268.46]  Um, you know, so that in the event that I died or whatever, it would still be in place.
[10268.46 --> 10271.36]  And we're still trying to figure out exactly what that would look like.
[10271.66 --> 10276.18]  At the end of the day, people said they don't want anything that actually has any kind of
[10276.18 --> 10276.72]  teeth.
[10276.82 --> 10280.24]  They just want us to give them a piece of paper that says, okay, yeah, here's what it
[10280.24 --> 10280.48]  is.
[10281.06 --> 10287.08]  Um, it's been really interesting watching the discourse shift on what I said.
[10287.98 --> 10291.44]  Um, now it seems like most people get it.
[10291.44 --> 10297.90]  All I was saying was that the warranty you have from whoever it is you have it from is
[10297.90 --> 10303.32]  only as good as their willingness to fulfill it because they can drag ass.
[10303.46 --> 10305.66]  They can just disappear.
[10306.40 --> 10313.80]  Um, there's plenty of companies that change warranty or, uh, claim warranty violations for
[10313.80 --> 10315.26]  whatever BS reason.
[10315.42 --> 10321.42]  Any, any warranty policy, any warranty policy that would make it past any lawyer worth their
[10321.42 --> 10325.14]  salt is going to have a clause in there that basically says, yeah, the whole thing's at
[10325.14 --> 10326.14]  our discretion anyway.
[10326.80 --> 10334.60]  Um, and so the point I had been trying to make way back then was that we wanted to do
[10334.60 --> 10336.44]  it right.
[10336.44 --> 10352.58]  And so, um, I don't know, uh, coming, coming back to your actual question.
[10352.58 --> 10359.54]  I, I, I don't know how to answer this without, you know, without it being misunderstood.
[10360.04 --> 10363.98]  Um, inheritance tax is a problem.
[10365.26 --> 10373.38]  Um, but I don't think that it will impact our ability to be a real company that will survive
[10373.38 --> 10374.34]  without us.
[10374.34 --> 10376.38]  I think there are solutions.
[10376.86 --> 10381.88]  Um, and it doesn't have to be that, you know, our kids inherit it or whatever else.
[10381.88 --> 10388.20]  In fact, I, I haven't seen any indication that it would even be remotely appropriate for
[10388.20 --> 10390.22]  our kids to inherit the company.
[10390.48 --> 10397.32]  Uh, the last thing I would want to see is for it to just be sold and just some random, you
[10397.32 --> 10404.68]  know, media company acquisition holding co, you know, take it and, and, and, and, you
[10404.68 --> 10406.26]  know, screw it up.
[10406.32 --> 10406.54]  Right.
[10406.86 --> 10409.36]  Um, but we do have some ideas.
[10409.60 --> 10414.70]  I don't think I'm at a point now where I'm ready to say exactly how it would work.
[10414.76 --> 10416.74]  Yes, we, we do have trusts in Canada.
[10416.74 --> 10417.86]  That is a thing that exists.
[10417.86 --> 10424.20]  That is an option for, um, tax-free inheritance, but there are a ton of limitations around them.
[10424.20 --> 10425.72]  Ivan understands it better than I do.
[10425.72 --> 10431.46]  It's, it's not really viable if we plan to run the company for our lives and then, um,
[10431.46 --> 10433.94]  have some kind of succession plan that involved our kids.
[10433.94 --> 10435.18]  But I, I don't know that it would.
[10436.02 --> 10438.42]  Um, urban fervor says, I like how Matt Pat is doing it.
[10438.44 --> 10440.16]  I actually haven't seen his approach.
[10440.32 --> 10442.46]  It's wild how many YouTubers are just like retiring.
[10443.08 --> 10445.70]  Um, I, uh, I called it on Tom Scott though.
[10446.14 --> 10450.92]  I was like, dude's my age, but he was talking about retiring and he's already revised the title
[10450.92 --> 10454.72]  of his video and been like, yo, people, for people who didn't make it to the second
[10454.72 --> 10455.78]  sentence of my video.
[10455.94 --> 10457.20]  It's, I didn't mean like forever.
[10457.28 --> 10462.26]  I mean, he even, he even said in, um, he's just, he's, he had, he had a commitment to
[10462.26 --> 10463.06]  a certain amount of videos.
[10463.06 --> 10463.18]  Yeah.
[10463.18 --> 10464.24]  He's not doing weekly videos.
[10464.38 --> 10464.54]  Yeah.
[10465.12 --> 10465.34]  Yeah.
[10465.68 --> 10466.08]  Okay.
[10466.30 --> 10469.80]  I mean, he didn't click bait it a little bit, which is funny because I, he and I have
[10469.80 --> 10473.62]  had some conversations about, you know, clickability and whatever.
[10473.62 --> 10479.86]  And it's like, okay, dude, cause that was pretty quick bait right there, but sure.
[10480.58 --> 10483.34]  Um, okay.
[10483.38 --> 10485.60]  Apparently Matt Pat sold the channel a year or two ago.
[10485.72 --> 10487.20]  He's fulfilled his contract and stepping away.
[10487.26 --> 10490.28]  So that's basically what we would have done if we had taken our offer.
[10490.28 --> 10490.88]  Yeah.
[10491.18 --> 10492.54]  I just, I wasn't ready yet.
[10493.68 --> 10500.80]  Um, it's possible that we could do something like that, but I don't looking back at it.
[10500.86 --> 10506.28]  Now, the money would have been very good, especially considering the challenges that we've faced
[10506.28 --> 10506.80]  this year.
[10506.80 --> 10507.16]  Right.
[10507.18 --> 10509.38]  I would have been almost ready to walk away now.
[10509.76 --> 10511.04]  I'm like, okay, yeah, whatever.
[10511.10 --> 10512.64]  This is your mess to clean up now, apparently.
[10513.18 --> 10517.46]  Um, so the money would have worked out really well, but what I don't think would have worked
[10517.46 --> 10518.90]  out really well is the company.
[10519.12 --> 10522.46]  I don't see why they wouldn't have just gone.
[10523.18 --> 10523.32]  Okay.
[10523.32 --> 10525.46]  Well, this didn't work out and moved on to their next acquisition.
[10526.26 --> 10526.44]  Right.
[10526.46 --> 10529.52]  And I think that it would have really impacted the people who work here and the people who
[10529.52 --> 10531.88]  really do care about what it's that we're trying to do.
[10532.06 --> 10532.22]  Yeah.
[10532.80 --> 10534.58]  So I'm, I'm really happy.
[10534.66 --> 10535.36]  We didn't do it.
[10535.40 --> 10538.00]  We're, we've still, we've got a lot of unfinished business.
[10542.00 --> 10547.32]  I, uh, DLL, is there a product that still exists today named after an outdated
[10547.32 --> 10550.68]  or expected, but once innovative feature?
[10550.92 --> 10554.84]  Take windows, for example, symbolizing simultaneous open software windows.
[10555.68 --> 10557.36]  I wasn't sure on this one.
[10558.36 --> 10561.14]  I think windows is a pretty good example.
[10562.42 --> 10564.56]  I'm sure there's gotta be other examples.
[10565.48 --> 10565.74]  I don't know.
[10565.82 --> 10567.02]  Like RCA cable.
[10567.98 --> 10568.88]  No, not really.
[10569.44 --> 10569.96]  Sort of.
[10570.92 --> 10572.32]  Um, a product.
[10572.32 --> 10573.00]  A product.
[10573.00 --> 10573.52]  Radio Shack.
[10574.10 --> 10575.66]  That still exists today.
[10575.80 --> 10576.68]  Oh, hold on a second.
[10577.34 --> 10579.42]  Um, um, um, um, um, movies.
[10580.76 --> 10581.16]  Oh.
[10581.72 --> 10583.00]  We were just talking about this.
[10583.12 --> 10584.38]  We were talking about this in the writing.
[10584.58 --> 10584.64]  That's really good.
[10585.06 --> 10585.68]  That's real.
[10585.76 --> 10586.74]  That's a really good example.
[10586.74 --> 10591.70]  You know, like the talkies, the movies, you know, back when the moving pictures, you
[10591.70 --> 10594.72]  know, the movies, we don't even think about that anymore.
[10595.82 --> 10597.26]  Would this be the streamies?
[10597.38 --> 10598.50]  Or films even.
[10598.64 --> 10601.42]  I mean, anything to do with production pretty much.
[10601.42 --> 10601.68]  Yeah.
[10601.80 --> 10602.02]  Yeah.
[10602.24 --> 10602.48]  Yeah.
[10602.48 --> 10602.96]  Yeah.
[10603.32 --> 10603.68]  Yeah.
[10604.04 --> 10604.28]  Yeah.
[10604.58 --> 10606.84]  Fujifilm, someone said, as a company name?
[10606.96 --> 10607.30]  The movie.
[10607.36 --> 10608.12]  That's a company, though.
[10608.12 --> 10608.66]  That's not a product.
[10609.26 --> 10610.14]  The movies, though.
[10610.50 --> 10610.70]  Yeah.
[10610.92 --> 10612.40]  I didn't realize it was product specific.
[10612.56 --> 10612.84]  But yeah.
[10613.70 --> 10613.98]  Okay.
[10614.02 --> 10616.20]  That's not really a product either, but get over it.
[10616.20 --> 10618.00]  Yeah.
[10621.84 --> 10627.30]  What do you think about Cooler Master killing the original spec NR200 and completely killing
[10627.30 --> 10629.48]  the NR200 air cooler compatibility?
[10630.08 --> 10631.70]  I did not understand this question.
[10632.12 --> 10634.44]  I mean, NR200 is presumably a case.
[10634.56 --> 10634.76]  Yeah.
[10636.04 --> 10637.40]  It's a small form factor case.
[10637.48 --> 10639.60]  I had not been following any of this drama.
[10640.94 --> 10642.86]  Eventually, you're going to stop making a product, right?
[10642.86 --> 10642.90]  Right.
[10643.16 --> 10648.92]  So, like, why is this completely killing the NR200 air cooler compatibility?
[10649.22 --> 10650.32]  That I don't...
[10650.32 --> 10651.10]  What are they talking about?
[10651.18 --> 10651.56]  I don't know.
[10652.54 --> 10653.04]  Not sure.
[10654.44 --> 10655.14]  I mean, yeah.
[10655.18 --> 10658.86]  You got to have kind of a target with your product, right?
[10658.98 --> 10664.78]  So, if you're basically targeting water coolers and you've got kind of an idea for how the
[10664.78 --> 10667.06]  system should be built, there's so many options for AIOs.
[10667.16 --> 10669.44]  I don't really think you can look at that and go, like, rude.
[10669.44 --> 10676.58]  Um, it's a bummer if you wanted to do an air-cooled NR200 build, but these things kind of happen.
[10676.68 --> 10678.36]  And if there's enough demand, I'm sure they'll bring it back.
[10679.06 --> 10681.44]  And if there isn't enough demand, I guess they knew something you didn't.
[10682.32 --> 10682.44]  Yeah.
[10684.66 --> 10685.90]  Hey, .dll.
[10686.20 --> 10692.50]  Any updated thoughts regarding the process of the ex-escapist team over at Second Wind and
[10692.50 --> 10695.44]  their transparency publishing detailed monthly revenue reports?
[10695.44 --> 10701.56]  That is a super, super cool transparency commitment.
[10702.08 --> 10709.26]  Um, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that from a private group, like a private
[10709.26 --> 10709.84]  company.
[10710.70 --> 10714.58]  Um, viewership looks...
[10715.42 --> 10715.94]  Consistent.
[10716.06 --> 10719.58]  ...pretty in the range for...
[10720.06 --> 10720.78]  What they were doing before.
[10720.78 --> 10721.94]  ...the subscriber count.
[10721.94 --> 10723.06]  Um...
[10723.06 --> 10726.36]  It also looks very similar to what they were doing before, like fully ramble-matic, which
[10726.36 --> 10727.28]  is, um...
[10727.28 --> 10727.70]  It's...
[10727.70 --> 10729.58]  Full punctuation.
[10729.68 --> 10731.82]  Yeah, man, there's so many things we made videos about this week.
[10731.86 --> 10735.96]  We have a reference to this that I think you guys will find quite funny in one of our
[10735.96 --> 10736.28]  videos.
[10736.54 --> 10736.76]  Oh.
[10737.16 --> 10739.72]  Um, yeah, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna spoil it.
[10739.76 --> 10740.36]  Watch every video.
[10740.46 --> 10741.26]  Ha ha ha, got him.
[10741.34 --> 10741.70]  Got him.
[10741.90 --> 10744.50]  Um, okay, where, where are they publishing this?
[10744.54 --> 10746.64]  I assume they have, uh, okay, here, a Patreon.
[10747.02 --> 10749.04]  It's not like they could have been on float plane or whatever.
[10749.04 --> 10749.60]  No problem.
[10749.72 --> 10751.08]  Don't, don't bother reaching out to us.
[10751.08 --> 10751.52]  Doesn't matter.
[10751.84 --> 10755.02]  Uh, the point is, I guess they probably have some articles or something.
[10755.16 --> 10756.96]  I guess you'd have to be a patron to see them.
[10757.06 --> 10758.36]  I don't, I don't know where they publish these things.
[10758.38 --> 10759.48]  Whoa, look at that support!
[10760.78 --> 10762.84]  14,185 paid members.
[10763.02 --> 10763.64]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[10763.72 --> 10765.40]  80,660 a month.
[10765.50 --> 10766.22]  Good on you guys.
[10766.30 --> 10767.32]  It's a million bucks a year.
[10767.54 --> 10768.00]  That's fantastic.
[10768.20 --> 10768.88]  That's fantastic.
[10769.06 --> 10769.60]  Good job.
[10770.56 --> 10770.98]  Very cool.
[10771.00 --> 10772.10]  Really rooting for these guys.
[10772.94 --> 10775.66]  Uh, the income report is in the YouTube post section, apparently.
[10776.16 --> 10777.50]  So, like, community posts, I guess?
[10778.54 --> 10779.38]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[10779.38 --> 10782.50]  We're two weeks out from when we started taking salaries.
[10782.64 --> 10784.04]  Hey, good for you guys!
[10784.22 --> 10785.04]  Freaking A!
[10785.54 --> 10786.16]  That's wicked.
[10786.76 --> 10788.16]  Love to see it!
[10790.76 --> 10791.60]  Premium Discord.
[10792.22 --> 10792.86]  All right, whatever.
[10792.96 --> 10793.82]  I'm just rooting for them.
[10795.14 --> 10796.02]  So, good job, you guys.
[10796.82 --> 10797.10]  Cool.
[10797.90 --> 10799.12]  That's all I have to say about that.
[10799.32 --> 10799.58]  Yeah.
[10801.88 --> 10802.56]  Mad respect.
[10802.56 --> 10803.10]  Hey, DLL.
[10804.98 --> 10810.40]  Linus, how's the relationship of long-term money per view compared to, uh, compared between
[10810.40 --> 10816.16]  an LTT video, one that could be relevant at any time, and a tech or game-linked video where
[10816.16 --> 10818.08]  it really matters to watch right now?
[10818.62 --> 10822.06]  Uh, viewership falls off a cliff for anything news-related.
[10822.06 --> 10826.14]  I don't even know how Google quite tells what's news-related and what's not, but they do.
[10826.54 --> 10830.66]  Uh, they can tell, and, uh, there are some LTT videos.
[10830.76 --> 10837.02]  I mean, we made a video reacting to our most profitable videos, uh, way back when, and almost
[10837.02 --> 10844.54]  all of them were LTT videos with a ton of views, or LTT livestream archives that had monstrous
[10844.54 --> 10845.30]  watch time.
[10845.30 --> 10847.56]  So, they made a ton of money from YouTube Premium.
[10848.30 --> 10853.76]  Uh, for something like TechLinked or GameLinked, basically, we're just relying on whatever it
[10853.76 --> 10858.96]  gets within the first couple of weeks, and there's almost no long-term tail on any of
[10858.96 --> 10859.08]  it.
[10859.14 --> 10865.26]  If I were to take our, our entire content library and sort by, I can't sort by most
[10865.26 --> 10866.76]  revenue, so whatever.
[10867.02 --> 10871.64]  I guess, um, I won't be able to give you any additional information, but it will be way
[10871.64 --> 10871.86]  less.
[10872.28 --> 10872.88]  Way less.
[10875.30 --> 10878.82]  Um, and I guess if you want to read this one, you can.
[10878.92 --> 10879.68]  I don't know how you want to hear that.
[10879.68 --> 10880.86]  Uh, no, I don't think we're supposed to.
[10880.92 --> 10885.54]  I think, um, can you just flag that for someone to get in touch with, uh, Sergio?
[10886.06 --> 10886.38]  Sergio?
[10886.84 --> 10888.88]  I, I've sent it to Steven.
[10889.14 --> 10889.40]  Okay.
[10889.50 --> 10891.06]  Sergio, we are acknowledging your message.
[10891.14 --> 10894.40]  Hey, thanks for the merch message, and I'm going to archive it so it doesn't show anywhere.
[10895.46 --> 10895.82]  Cool.
[10895.82 --> 10896.10]  Cool.
[10899.60 --> 10900.58]  Um, hmm.
[10900.92 --> 10901.58]  Adam asks...
[10901.58 --> 10902.32]  I think a couple of names coming.
[10902.32 --> 10905.82]  Yeah, Adam asks if I have any issues with games crashing on the RG Ally.
[10905.98 --> 10911.46]  I really haven't, but I haven't played a huge variety of games on mine, so my, my experience
[10911.46 --> 10912.66]  may not mirror your own.
[10913.04 --> 10917.78]  And James asks if we have any insider news on Steam Deck B button sticking issues.
[10917.78 --> 10920.64]  No, I do not.
[10920.78 --> 10922.40]  I've still been on my ally.
[10922.64 --> 10927.06]  It's, uh, the, the, the better performance has kept me, but there are definitely games
[10927.06 --> 10928.78]  I'd rather play on the better screen.
[10929.02 --> 10932.82]  Um, I'm just not playing any of them right now.
[10933.28 --> 10934.66]  Um, hey, thanks, Christopher.
[10935.82 --> 10938.26]  Appreciate you showing that.
[10938.34 --> 10941.72]  Don't agree, but hey, your message is going to come up in the scrolly thing, and that's
[10941.72 --> 10941.92]  it.
[10942.22 --> 10943.26]  We will see you again next week.
[10943.34 --> 10944.64]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[10944.68 --> 10946.14]  How did this last for three and a half hours?
[10946.14 --> 10947.24]  We had like four topics.
[10952.92 --> 10954.22]  It just is what it is.
[10955.12 --> 10960.18]  We reacted to our own video, which I would be really interested to see the metrics on.
[10961.30 --> 10962.56]  Maybe we should do that more.
[10964.54 --> 10964.86]  Contentception.
[10966.42 --> 10966.82]  Bye.
[10967.08 --> 10967.62]  There it is.
[10970.96 --> 10971.80]  Come on, man.
[10971.86 --> 10972.46]  Say the line.
[10972.46 --> 10973.98]  World's slowest buy.
[10975.44 --> 10976.00]  Got him.
[10976.14 --> 10978.44]  Oh, wait.
[10978.62 --> 10979.56]  We're not going to really hear Dan.
[10979.78 --> 10981.02]  Yeah, I'm going to put those back on.
[10982.42 --> 10985.12]  We both took our headphones off.
[10985.20 --> 10988.78]  We're like, uh, wait, we can't talk to Dan because he's like, you know, there.
[10989.66 --> 10990.46]  Oh, wow, Vessi.
[10990.46 --> 10990.52]  Vessi.
[10990.58 --> 10991.18]  Bye.
[10991.32 --> 11011.88]  Bye.
[11011.90 --> 11012.54]  Bye.
[11012.60 --> 11012.66]  Bye.
[11012.68 --> 11013.54]  Bye.
