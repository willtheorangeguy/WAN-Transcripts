[0.00 --> 3.88]  Hey there, everybody. Welcome to a chilled out, relaxed WAN show.
[3.98 --> 4.72]  So smooth.
[5.06 --> 7.64]  We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[7.66 --> 11.46]  We're going to be talking about Apple's iPhone 16 glow time event,
[12.12 --> 14.40]  the PlayStation 5 Pro announcement. Luke.
[14.94 --> 17.80]  We also have some good news in This Week in AI,
[18.68 --> 23.52]  and we're going to be talking about how the U.S. government is pushing for greater VPN access.
[23.92 --> 25.44]  They're pushing for greater VPN access.
[25.76 --> 25.86]  Yeah.
[25.98 --> 26.92]  I think it's a good thing.
[27.04 --> 27.26]  Wow.
[27.38 --> 27.84]  It's smooth.
[28.26 --> 29.24]  Goes down easy.
[30.00 --> 33.16]  Just like this intro to our intro.
[33.96 --> 34.96]  Uh, yeah.
[54.96 --> 57.38]  The show is brought to you today by Manscaped,
[57.38 --> 58.44]  The Ridge,
[58.80 --> 59.88]  and Acronis,
[59.94 --> 61.04]  along with our chair partner,
[61.16 --> 61.68]  Secret Lab,
[61.76 --> 62.92]  and our laptop partner,
[63.12 --> 63.54]  LG.
[63.70 --> 65.88]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic,
[66.20 --> 67.06]  which is, of course,
[67.18 --> 68.98]  that I was wrong this week.
[69.12 --> 69.42]  Yeah.
[69.60 --> 70.00]  Twice.
[70.18 --> 70.48]  Yeah.
[70.70 --> 73.96]  Now, I assume that you have watched literally nothing.
[74.26 --> 74.54]  Nope.
[74.92 --> 75.82]  I assume you know.
[75.82 --> 85.86]  I mean, I don't think there are any two tech products that you could care less about than the iPhone and the PlayStation.
[86.52 --> 86.86]  Yep.
[87.74 --> 88.22]  Yeah.
[88.30 --> 93.82]  So, why don't I catch you up on exactly what happened, and then we'll go from, uh...
[93.82 --> 97.70]  Wow.
[98.98 --> 103.48]  It's been three minutes, and we've already thrown something at our producer.
[104.16 --> 104.82]  I'm sorry.
[104.90 --> 105.52]  I was talking.
[105.52 --> 109.58]  Why don't we...
[109.58 --> 110.66]  What do you want to start with?
[110.78 --> 113.40]  Should I catch you up on the iPhone, or should I...
[113.40 --> 114.66]  Let's do the iPhone.
[115.00 --> 115.34]  Okay.
[115.94 --> 118.86]  So, Apple announced the iPhone 16 lineup.
[119.10 --> 120.08]  So, you've got the 16,
[120.50 --> 121.94]  the 16+,
[121.94 --> 122.92]  the 16 Pro,
[123.02 --> 124.38]  and the 16 Pro Max.
[124.56 --> 125.64]  If I recall correctly,
[125.78 --> 126.52]  honestly,
[126.52 --> 132.76]  I'm not obsessed with Apple's lineup and figuring out exactly what it is.
[132.90 --> 134.56]  I'll look at it when I need to,
[134.60 --> 135.56]  and I'll refresh myself,
[135.66 --> 136.36]  but other than that,
[136.44 --> 138.56]  it honestly isn't something that I pay that close attention to.
[139.14 --> 139.60]  But,
[140.60 --> 142.06]  this time around,
[142.18 --> 144.54]  and this made people pretty angry,
[144.94 --> 149.48]  I was approaching the iPhone announcement event from a bit of a different perspective.
[150.14 --> 151.74]  So, I feel like...
[151.74 --> 152.86]  And what happened was,
[152.96 --> 154.50]  our video ended up having
[154.50 --> 158.64]  a pretty positive overall spin on it.
[158.82 --> 159.02]  Sure.
[159.08 --> 160.14]  When, largely,
[160.38 --> 162.02]  the reaction from the tech press,
[162.24 --> 164.58]  and sort of influencer army out there,
[164.62 --> 165.98]  was pretty negative.
[166.18 --> 166.38]  But,
[166.66 --> 168.48]  I'd like to explain why.
[168.56 --> 169.28]  So, first of all,
[169.32 --> 171.92]  let's talk about what makes the iPhone 16 lineup new.
[172.28 --> 176.08]  They're getting the new A18 processor family.
[176.22 --> 178.98]  So, we have a regular A18 in the iPhone 16,
[178.98 --> 183.08]  and then an A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro.
[183.08 --> 187.54]  As far as we can tell from Apple's comparative benchmarks,
[188.06 --> 188.20]  like,
[188.26 --> 193.26]  they didn't compare both of these new processors to one single predecessor.
[193.62 --> 195.46]  They compared them to different things.
[195.90 --> 196.06]  Oh.
[196.20 --> 198.94]  And if you do the math from previous Apple presentations,
[199.74 --> 202.12]  they seem like they're probably pretty close.
[202.12 --> 205.58]  So, it looks like they're very similar,
[205.74 --> 206.46]  in terms of the,
[206.62 --> 207.02]  at least,
[207.26 --> 208.16]  CPU performance,
[208.30 --> 209.12]  GPU performance,
[209.28 --> 210.58]  and neural processor performance.
[210.78 --> 214.56]  But all of this is going to become more clear as time goes on.
[217.56 --> 219.24]  There's upgraded glass.
[219.76 --> 223.10]  So, their ceramic shield is now significantly stronger.
[223.10 --> 227.06]  I actually don't have a,
[227.06 --> 230.08]  I don't have a summary of the specs in my notes,
[230.08 --> 232.54]  which I normally have when I run through something like this.
[232.58 --> 234.36]  So, we'll have to kind of figure that out.
[234.76 --> 235.16]  But,
[235.36 --> 237.76]  the things that really stood out to me
[237.76 --> 240.22]  were actually not necessarily the hardware.
[240.38 --> 240.50]  Oh,
[240.56 --> 240.90]  there's a new,
[240.96 --> 241.60]  there's a new button.
[241.90 --> 243.20]  It was like a programmable button.
[243.54 --> 243.78]  Yeah.
[243.84 --> 244.58]  Which is kind of cool.
[244.64 --> 245.20]  Action button,
[245.38 --> 245.60]  which,
[245.74 --> 246.64]  which I kind of like.
[246.76 --> 248.08]  Was that ever a thing in the past?
[248.84 --> 249.16]  Um,
[249.50 --> 250.44]  on the iPhone?
[250.64 --> 250.80]  I,
[250.86 --> 252.96]  I read some comments of people talking about like,
[253.00 --> 253.10]  oh,
[253.10 --> 254.24]  they took the button away
[254.24 --> 256.58]  so that they could give it back to us now.
[257.36 --> 257.82]  And I was like,
[257.88 --> 258.04]  what?
[258.16 --> 258.40]  I mean,
[258.42 --> 259.26]  they had the home button.
[259.78 --> 260.06]  Okay.
[260.18 --> 261.76]  But that wasn't programmable.
[261.96 --> 262.52]  Did they have like a button?
[263.88 --> 264.90]  Action button was on the 15 Pro.
[264.90 --> 265.06]  Yeah,
[265.06 --> 265.74]  it was on the 15 Pro,
[265.84 --> 267.38]  but now it's on the regular 16.
[268.00 --> 268.22]  Oh,
[268.22 --> 268.90]  so that's just,
[269.02 --> 269.22]  okay.
[269.40 --> 269.72]  So,
[270.04 --> 270.48]  there were,
[270.48 --> 272.80]  there were a few things that people were pretty,
[273.26 --> 273.58]  pretty,
[273.68 --> 274.18]  the camera,
[274.26 --> 275.84]  and the camera button is new across the board.
[276.20 --> 276.34]  Okay.
[276.34 --> 276.58]  So,
[276.72 --> 277.88]  we have a dedicated shutter button,
[277.88 --> 278.34]  but no,
[278.46 --> 281.00]  no iPhone in the past has ever had a shutter button.
[281.60 --> 282.00]  So,
[282.16 --> 285.40]  there were a couple of things that people were pretty upset about.
[285.80 --> 286.16]  And,
[286.24 --> 286.42]  uh,
[286.42 --> 288.26]  one of them was that in the video,
[288.38 --> 290.06]  I said that I was probably going to go,
[290.24 --> 293.14]  because I've been talking about switching to an iPhone for a little bit,
[293.22 --> 294.02]  for a while now.
[294.38 --> 295.36]  And I think I'm just,
[295.46 --> 296.26]  I'm overdue.
[296.74 --> 297.18]  Um,
[297.20 --> 301.84]  and there's a lot of things about iOS 18 that are looking very compelling to me.
[302.18 --> 303.44]  And there's some,
[303.60 --> 304.48]  there's some Android,
[305.08 --> 305.58]  um,
[305.58 --> 312.14]  there's some Android army members who are telling me that these aren't new features to Apple,
[312.14 --> 314.06]  or that they're copied from Android,
[314.06 --> 314.68]  or that,
[314.78 --> 315.24]  uh,
[315.24 --> 317.40]  they don't make that much of a difference or whatever.
[317.62 --> 317.96]  Uh,
[317.96 --> 320.14]  but the reality of it is that to me,
[320.14 --> 323.52]  like the phone operating system that I use doesn't really matter.
[323.52 --> 325.44]  And I don't really care who's copying from each other.
[325.98 --> 326.42]  Realistically,
[326.62 --> 328.26]  Google and Apple copy,
[328.26 --> 331.26]  copy liberally from each other at this point.
[331.26 --> 331.54]  And,
[331.60 --> 334.16]  and it doesn't really matter to me where it originated from.
[334.26 --> 337.66]  What matters to me is that I need a new device right now.
[337.98 --> 341.58]  And the iPhone 16 lineup actually looks pretty compelling.
[342.24 --> 342.28]  Um,
[342.28 --> 348.24]  I think that's kind of the root of where your thoughts on this stuff came from was that you need a new device and you're on an old one.
[348.94 --> 349.34]  Um,
[349.34 --> 349.74]  and I,
[349.74 --> 351.16]  I think you and I even talked about this.
[351.20 --> 351.66]  I don't remember,
[351.66 --> 352.74]  but I,
[352.92 --> 355.90]  a lot of people that are unhappy with the event,
[355.90 --> 360.76]  it's because they have a current generation device and they're looking at the upgrade and going,
[360.92 --> 362.20]  this doesn't really seem like a lot,
[362.20 --> 364.24]  but we're at,
[364.44 --> 364.68]  I mean,
[364.68 --> 366.68]  it's called iPhone 16.
[367.30 --> 370.32]  The jumps per generation is going to slow down.
[370.56 --> 372.04]  Phones have been boring for a long time now.
[372.16 --> 372.90]  And the,
[372.90 --> 378.62]  the way I'm kind of looking at it is you can be disappointed quite genuinely every single generation,
[378.62 --> 385.34]  or you can start shifting your goalposts a little bit and look like one or two generations back for your improvement jumps.
[385.70 --> 387.98]  And I think it's going to be more than one or two.
[388.14 --> 391.72]  I think realistically what this comes down to is that,
[391.72 --> 392.40]  the,
[392.50 --> 399.30]  the days of us getting something major to upgrade to every single generation,
[399.64 --> 401.72]  not only are they dead,
[402.08 --> 404.42]  but they've been dead for a long time.
[404.60 --> 405.60]  I completely agree.
[405.76 --> 408.20]  I've been over it for a few years now at the very least.
[408.70 --> 409.00]  Um,
[409.02 --> 410.04]  and so I,
[410.18 --> 410.46]  um,
[410.84 --> 411.04]  I,
[411.04 --> 411.98]  I guess that was,
[412.20 --> 417.38]  and the amount of speculation that we were paid by Apple to have kind of a positive spin.
[417.46 --> 417.86]  Guys,
[418.28 --> 421.70]  anytime you see someone who accuses us of being paid by Apple,
[421.72 --> 423.80]  Apple to be positive about Apple products,
[423.80 --> 428.14]  you can immediately just dismiss anything invited to the event.
[428.36 --> 428.48]  No,
[428.54 --> 428.96]  of course not.
[429.06 --> 429.20]  Yeah.
[431.00 --> 440.26]  Apple still paid the extent of Apple's media relationship with me up until now is that they emailed me once.
[440.60 --> 441.94]  Are they kind of cool with Mac address?
[442.70 --> 442.94]  Oh,
[443.02 --> 444.30]  I don't know if they are.
[444.40 --> 444.64]  Uh,
[444.64 --> 446.30]  no one has kept me up to date on it.
[446.34 --> 446.52]  Okay.
[446.58 --> 447.52]  So I'm not sure.
[447.68 --> 447.92]  Maybe,
[448.06 --> 449.12]  but as far as,
[449.50 --> 451.22]  as far as I am concerned,
[451.22 --> 453.82]  and as far as the LTT channel is concerned,
[454.28 --> 455.74]  Apple has never so much,
[455.84 --> 458.70]  has never gone past scheduling a conference call with me.
[459.16 --> 462.20]  They never actually went through with the call.
[462.20 --> 463.94]  It did get scheduled,
[464.16 --> 469.46]  but it was canceled minutes before we actually went through with engaging for the first time.
[469.54 --> 470.26]  Apple has,
[470.36 --> 471.48]  has no interest,
[471.62 --> 472.56]  um,
[473.50 --> 475.98]  in working together with me.
[476.22 --> 476.66]  So,
[476.86 --> 477.08]  so,
[477.26 --> 478.62]  so people were mad about a number of things.
[478.68 --> 479.76]  They were mad because we,
[479.86 --> 482.66]  they felt we were overly positive about the event.
[483.10 --> 483.52]  Um,
[483.52 --> 490.26]  and I think that a big part of that comes down to that difference in perspective where most of the rest of the tech media,
[490.26 --> 494.46]  where if they're running a 15 pro now or a 15 pro max are looking at this going,
[494.58 --> 494.72]  uh,
[494.86 --> 495.14]  boring.
[495.48 --> 495.60]  Yeah.
[495.82 --> 496.06]  You know,
[496.08 --> 497.18]  where's the innovation Apple?
[497.66 --> 502.04]  And I think they just have to get used to the idea that that's going to happen over a much longer cycle.
[502.04 --> 503.94]  Whereas I'm looking at it going,
[504.30 --> 504.52]  man,
[504.96 --> 508.24]  my AirPods pro twos just got way better.
[508.58 --> 510.32]  Like ages after I bought them,
[510.38 --> 511.60]  which I'm pretty stoked on.
[511.70 --> 512.40]  I didn't even know there's a thing.
[512.46 --> 512.98]  That sounds great.
[513.04 --> 515.70]  It's a kind of behavior that what feature are you gaining?
[515.88 --> 516.16]  Um,
[516.70 --> 517.82]  for me personally,
[517.82 --> 518.48]  not much.
[518.48 --> 520.36]  They're optimizing the noise cancellation.
[520.70 --> 521.84]  They're adding some like,
[521.96 --> 523.68]  and this is retroactive to what you have now.
[523.74 --> 523.84]  Yeah.
[523.86 --> 525.08]  It looks like it's like a,
[525.08 --> 526.68]  some kind of machine learning assisted,
[526.68 --> 527.50]  uh,
[527.50 --> 531.16]  quickly switching in between transparency mode for conversations and everything back up.
[531.16 --> 532.08]  It's really cool.
[532.24 --> 532.50]  Yep.
[532.80 --> 533.12]  Um,
[533.26 --> 535.56]  it's something that absolutely exists in other products,
[535.56 --> 539.74]  but my assumption is that based on how well Apple has handled active noise cancellation,
[539.86 --> 541.18]  it'll actually be implemented pretty well.
[541.24 --> 542.60]  And I might actually use it.
[543.04 --> 543.46]  Um,
[543.46 --> 545.34]  they're also adding like hearing aid,
[545.38 --> 546.76]  like functionality to,
[546.76 --> 547.48]  to AirPods.
[547.48 --> 548.26]  Um,
[548.38 --> 551.96]  I've been using them as casual hearing protection for a long time,
[551.96 --> 557.24]  but they are more formally talking about using them that way with the improved active noise cancellation.
[557.60 --> 559.16]  If you cancel out a wave,
[559.64 --> 561.50]  the wave is canceled.
[561.90 --> 562.32]  No,
[562.42 --> 562.64]  I was,
[562.68 --> 562.98]  I was thinking,
[563.08 --> 563.24]  you,
[563.32 --> 567.06]  you mentioned hearing aid and then noise protection.
[567.20 --> 567.40]  Both.
[567.40 --> 569.98]  And I thought you were saying those were the same thing for a second.
[569.98 --> 570.30]  No,
[570.30 --> 570.52]  no,
[570.60 --> 570.78]  yeah,
[570.78 --> 571.42]  not the same thing.
[571.42 --> 571.54]  No,
[571.54 --> 572.44]  you're talking about different stuff.
[572.56 --> 572.64]  Okay.
[572.88 --> 573.24]  Um,
[573.56 --> 574.54]  so I just,
[574.64 --> 575.68]  I thought that was pretty cool.
[575.74 --> 580.14]  I actually opened the video on like a software update essentially.
[580.14 --> 582.58]  And I think a lot of people were kind of surprised to see that.
[582.78 --> 591.00]  The other thing that people kind of went after me for was that I told them my intention was to go with the iPhone 16,
[591.00 --> 591.94]  uh,
[591.94 --> 594.98]  plus the non pro and,
[594.98 --> 599.52]  and a lot of the feedback that I got on that was Linus,
[599.66 --> 600.00]  you know,
[600.16 --> 604.30]  if you're going to go into the Apple ecosystem for the first time in a long time,
[604.30 --> 605.94]  you should be having the full experience.
[605.94 --> 607.86]  But the reality of it is guys,
[607.86 --> 609.78]  like I can pick any iPhone I want,
[609.78 --> 610.30]  like we're,
[610.30 --> 612.32]  we're ordering all of them through work.
[612.40 --> 614.12]  I just literally grab off the shelf,
[614.24 --> 615.26]  whichever one I am.
[615.40 --> 616.86]  I want to use.
[616.94 --> 621.50]  But the reason that I went with the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 plus,
[621.50 --> 623.68]  I haven't actually a hundred percent decided which one I want.
[623.74 --> 628.68]  I'm going to hold them first is that I don't think people should be buying the pro.
[630.42 --> 631.30]  Don't get me wrong.
[631.30 --> 632.18]  I don't know what the difference is.
[632.28 --> 635.40]  There's features on the pro that I would like to have.
[635.64 --> 640.00]  The regular iPhone 16 still doesn't have a high refresh rate display.
[640.14 --> 640.58]  Ooh.
[641.08 --> 641.52]  Yeah.
[641.88 --> 642.50]  60 Hertz,
[642.68 --> 644.42]  which for like $800,
[645.32 --> 646.82]  pretty embarrassing.
[647.78 --> 648.22]  Um,
[648.60 --> 650.90]  but most of the other stuff that's,
[650.90 --> 651.14]  and,
[651.18 --> 652.32]  but then again,
[653.36 --> 657.66]  neither does the device that I am upgrading from.
[658.08 --> 658.16]  I,
[658.24 --> 658.36]  I,
[658.46 --> 659.36]  it feels nicer.
[659.50 --> 660.82]  I have a higher refresh rate screen now.
[660.88 --> 661.40]  I can feel it.
[661.46 --> 662.30]  It does.
[662.78 --> 665.56]  But I guess what I've discovered is for my phone.
[665.92 --> 667.58]  I don't know if I,
[667.58 --> 670.10]  I don't game on my phone.
[671.36 --> 673.18]  It does make touch feel more responsive.
[673.18 --> 679.36]  I can absolutely instantly tell if I'm using a high refresh rate device and things like,
[679.36 --> 679.76]  uh,
[679.76 --> 681.54]  higher polling rates on the touch input.
[681.54 --> 684.54]  It definitely makes a difference,
[684.54 --> 689.20]  but I think I have just become not that much of a power user.
[689.20 --> 691.70]  And a lot of the other features on the pro,
[691.92 --> 693.78]  I just don't need them.
[693.84 --> 695.70]  The studio quality microphone,
[696.42 --> 696.84]  4k,
[696.94 --> 698.40]  120 FPS recording.
[698.84 --> 700.24]  I don't need that stuff.
[702.20 --> 703.10]  It's got another,
[703.24 --> 704.38]  I think it's got another camera,
[704.60 --> 704.70]  man.
[704.78 --> 710.74]  The iPhone's ability to film in log makes video on iPhone extremely interesting.
[711.30 --> 711.56]  Sure.
[712.22 --> 713.92]  But I'm not using it professionally.
[714.06 --> 714.98]  This is just my phone.
[715.08 --> 717.06]  Do I need to shoot 4k 120 on it?
[718.26 --> 718.82]  Like I can,
[718.94 --> 719.86]  they added,
[720.04 --> 720.78]  I could see it.
[721.00 --> 722.86]  They added pro res recording to the non pro.
[724.20 --> 728.68]  So if I just want to record in pro res and I don't need 120 frames per second.
[728.80 --> 729.58]  Is there ever like you,
[729.62 --> 731.82]  you ever want to shoot like a little slow-mo thing of,
[731.90 --> 732.80]  of your son,
[732.90 --> 733.78]  uh,
[733.82 --> 735.06]  playing badminton or something like that.
[735.08 --> 735.64]  I don't know.
[735.72 --> 735.90]  Sure.
[735.96 --> 736.82]  Do I need it at 4k?
[737.48 --> 737.80]  Oh,
[737.82 --> 738.32]  it's four.
[738.42 --> 738.62]  Okay.
[738.70 --> 739.48]  So you could still do.
[739.58 --> 739.92]  Yeah.
[739.96 --> 740.28]  Oh yeah.
[740.28 --> 740.96]  I can still do high.
[740.96 --> 742.46]  I can still do high frame rate.
[742.62 --> 742.74]  I just,
[742.94 --> 743.30]  sheesh.
[743.68 --> 743.82]  Yeah.
[743.84 --> 744.04]  It's,
[744.08 --> 744.46]  it's just,
[744.54 --> 745.20]  it's a lot.
[745.66 --> 746.10]  Um,
[746.50 --> 747.14]  people are saying,
[747.20 --> 747.42]  okay,
[747.42 --> 747.68]  yeah,
[747.76 --> 748.04]  the,
[748.14 --> 748.60]  uh,
[748.60 --> 749.10]  the lidar,
[749.28 --> 750.16]  the lidar is great.
[750.48 --> 751.02]  You know what?
[751.34 --> 752.40]  That is great.
[753.16 --> 759.02]  I don't take that many pictures and the handful of features that need the depth sensing.
[759.44 --> 760.14]  I can,
[760.42 --> 763.70]  I know enough people that I can borrow a phone from.
[763.78 --> 764.36]  Like there's been,
[764.54 --> 765.84]  I think it's come up twice.
[766.06 --> 766.42]  Uh,
[766.42 --> 769.28]  once when I had to do a facial scan for that VR headset,
[769.42 --> 770.22]  the big screen beyond,
[770.22 --> 774.44]  and once when I was,
[774.52 --> 774.88]  um,
[774.96 --> 775.68]  a bit part,
[775.76 --> 775.84]  I,
[775.88 --> 780.80]  when I had a bit part in an undisclosed film that I don't know if it's ever even going to get made at this point.
[780.88 --> 782.46]  I haven't heard back about it in a while.
[782.94 --> 783.34]  Um,
[783.66 --> 784.02]  whatever.
[784.28 --> 784.64]  Anyway,
[784.78 --> 785.54]  I wonder if part of it,
[785.62 --> 785.74]  sorry,
[785.82 --> 790.90]  I used it to scan the room that I was in because that was useful for them for VFX,
[790.90 --> 792.08]  like overlays.
[792.08 --> 794.44]  I wonder if part of this is people that,
[794.66 --> 795.66]  can you pre-order yet?
[796.72 --> 796.92]  I,
[796.92 --> 797.12]  I,
[797.12 --> 798.26]  I think we've placed our orders.
[798.40 --> 799.32]  Did they set up pre-orders right now?
[799.32 --> 800.12]  I actually don't know.
[800.18 --> 801.06]  It's a minor detail.
[801.18 --> 801.74]  I have procurement.
[801.92 --> 802.70]  We'll take care of that.
[803.24 --> 803.40]  Yeah.
[803.46 --> 803.60]  Yeah.
[803.60 --> 803.72]  Yeah.
[804.20 --> 805.16]  Way to go.
[805.26 --> 805.62]  It's nice.
[806.00 --> 806.44]  Um,
[806.44 --> 807.70]  uh,
[807.70 --> 808.40]  what was I going to say?
[808.40 --> 808.84]  Uh,
[808.88 --> 813.76]  I wonder if some of this is people that bought the pro that are,
[814.14 --> 814.26]  yes,
[814.30 --> 814.68]  you can,
[814.76 --> 815.56]  you can pre-order it.
[815.72 --> 817.58]  I wonder if this is people that bought the pro that,
[817.76 --> 818.30]  um,
[818.44 --> 818.78]  you know,
[818.80 --> 821.22]  want the tech guy to make the same decision they did.
[821.66 --> 823.64]  I do think there's a lot of that.
[825.82 --> 826.44]  And the,
[826.52 --> 828.20]  and I can see why they would want to,
[828.32 --> 831.08]  because it's $1,500 Canadian,
[831.26 --> 831.60]  Canadian.
[831.72 --> 832.30]  This is Canadian.
[832.30 --> 832.92]  So it starts at,
[833.02 --> 834.14]  I believe 1200 us.
[834.76 --> 835.08]  Um,
[835.30 --> 836.70]  and it is funny.
[836.74 --> 837.70]  It is funny to me,
[837.70 --> 840.10]  seeing how many people are legitimately angry at me.
[840.16 --> 841.08]  Like I've betrayed them.
[841.24 --> 841.84]  The pro max is $1,750.
[842.42 --> 843.22]  Because I'm,
[843.32 --> 844.62]  because I'm using an iPhone.
[845.44 --> 845.80]  Um,
[847.44 --> 850.46]  the pro max is what my car costs.
[851.60 --> 852.48]  Not my current one.
[852.56 --> 852.76]  Yeah.
[852.76 --> 853.40]  I was going to say,
[853.52 --> 854.42]  surely that's not right.
[854.48 --> 854.58]  No,
[854.62 --> 854.96]  my first,
[854.98 --> 855.60]  my first car.
[855.72 --> 856.04]  Sorry.
[856.24 --> 856.80]  I'm getting older.
[856.88 --> 858.06]  Your first car was a minute ago.
[858.06 --> 859.96]  You might have to have some inflationary adjustments,
[859.96 --> 861.64]  which we'll be talking about a little bit later.
[862.14 --> 862.50]  Um,
[862.68 --> 863.58]  it's still a lot of money.
[864.26 --> 864.54]  Yeah.
[864.64 --> 864.94]  I mean,
[865.00 --> 865.38]  we're,
[865.74 --> 867.06]  and so I was realistically,
[867.06 --> 867.58]  realistically,
[867.58 --> 869.78]  I was looking at the iPhone 16 going,
[869.92 --> 870.12]  okay,
[870.18 --> 871.00]  is this really,
[871.10 --> 872.70]  do I need a titanium phone?
[873.74 --> 875.74]  Or is aluminum probably okay?
[875.90 --> 876.56]  Are you going to end up,
[876.68 --> 877.40]  that one's not in a case.
[877.44 --> 878.46]  Are you going to put it in a case anyways?
[878.62 --> 878.78]  No,
[878.82 --> 879.44]  I'm not going to put it in a case.
[879.44 --> 879.56]  Yeah.
[879.56 --> 879.76]  Okay.
[879.76 --> 881.00]  But like,
[881.64 --> 882.98]  it's aluminum and dude,
[883.08 --> 884.36]  their glass is like,
[884.80 --> 887.18]  very shatter resistant.
[887.40 --> 887.78]  So I'm,
[887.78 --> 888.88]  I'm really not that worried about it.
[888.88 --> 889.68]  I used to be no case.
[889.74 --> 891.02]  I was no case in my previous phone.
[891.26 --> 895.76]  This phone's so huge that I decided to get a case for it anyways,
[895.76 --> 896.44]  because I was like,
[896.46 --> 898.58]  I feel like it's just going to get knocked off of things more often.
[898.66 --> 898.78]  Yeah.
[898.78 --> 900.76]  Because it's enormous and I'm happy to have one.
[900.86 --> 901.44]  Look at this.
[902.94 --> 904.98]  There's a massive bite out of that.
[905.12 --> 905.32]  Oh,
[905.32 --> 905.54]  wow.
[905.64 --> 905.78]  Yeah.
[905.78 --> 906.74]  You really hit that one.
[906.86 --> 907.10]  Yeah.
[907.56 --> 907.92]  She,
[908.06 --> 908.34]  uh,
[908.58 --> 910.14]  that case is doing work and it,
[910.14 --> 911.52]  it is actually it's,
[911.60 --> 912.52]  it's been dropped a couple of times,
[912.52 --> 918.28]  but something that's kind of nice about it is that I just don't care because I don't even like the phone.
[918.68 --> 918.96]  Nice.
[919.04 --> 920.22]  But I don't want to replace it.
[920.36 --> 921.38]  So there's a case on it,
[921.38 --> 922.54]  but I don't care for it.
[922.54 --> 923.34]  If that makes sense.
[923.42 --> 923.84]  So it's just like,
[923.90 --> 923.98]  yeah,
[924.02 --> 924.28]  whatever.
[924.64 --> 924.80]  Yep.
[925.74 --> 926.64]  Which is a nice,
[926.72 --> 927.22]  uh,
[927.66 --> 929.08]  it's nice to just not worry about it.
[929.20 --> 930.06]  Another difference for the,
[930.32 --> 932.96]  for the pro is that the bezels are slightly smaller.
[932.96 --> 935.52]  So in about the same form factor there,
[935.66 --> 937.20]  the screens are 0.2 inches bigger.
[937.72 --> 939.48]  But then if I cared that much about that,
[939.54 --> 941.12]  why would I get an iPhone with like a,
[941.54 --> 941.76]  you know,
[941.76 --> 943.74]  giant forehead notch in it in the first place?
[943.74 --> 944.18]  Like I,
[944.26 --> 944.44]  I,
[944.54 --> 945.56]  I don't know guys.
[945.74 --> 946.06]  I mean,
[946.06 --> 946.68]  feel free,
[947.00 --> 949.66]  feel free to like come at me and let me know.
[949.82 --> 954.18]  But I think that people should probably just be getting the regular 16 if they,
[954.30 --> 955.10]  if they want an iPhone,
[955.34 --> 956.78]  if they want the ecosystem.
[956.78 --> 964.54]  And it's funny to me how we get so stuck in our tech bubble and we get so stuck in our sort of,
[964.60 --> 964.94]  um,
[964.94 --> 968.82]  in our priorities that sometimes we forget that most people don't care.
[969.30 --> 969.36]  Yeah.
[969.44 --> 975.52]  Most people cannot tell a 60 Hertz display from a high refresh rate display.
[975.64 --> 980.48]  Most people are also only looking to upgrade their phones when their battery life starts to annoy them too much,
[980.62 --> 982.28]  which is usually every like three years.
[982.28 --> 983.86]  or more,
[984.00 --> 989.26]  more like my battery life didn't really start getting bad on this until about the last year or so.
[989.30 --> 990.58]  And I believe this is up to,
[990.76 --> 992.62]  I believe this is six years.
[992.70 --> 993.92]  Probably depends on their usage.
[993.92 --> 994.88]  Like if they game a lot,
[994.94 --> 997.10]  so they're doing some really brutal battery cycles,
[997.10 --> 997.92]  um,
[997.92 --> 1000.28]  then it's going to be sooner if they don't later,
[1000.44 --> 1000.68]  et cetera,
[1000.74 --> 1000.98]  et cetera.
[1002.30 --> 1002.70]  Um,
[1003.24 --> 1003.94]  Nokia asks,
[1004.00 --> 1006.76]  you often say you prefer a phone where you can take photos and videos of kids,
[1006.82 --> 1010.44]  important moments with the iPhone 16 shutter button be a good addition for you.
[1011.12 --> 1011.46]  Um,
[1011.46 --> 1014.26]  I never need to be that quick on the draw.
[1014.38 --> 1018.90]  Like as long as I've got a gesture that I can activate in a reasonable amount of time
[1018.90 --> 1022.04]  and the onscreen button is there in a reasonable amount of time.
[1022.12 --> 1022.92]  Like I am,
[1023.00 --> 1030.10]  I'm so well adjusted now to the ergonomics of holding my phone so that my thumb is here for the shutter button.
[1030.10 --> 1030.56]  I just,
[1032.00 --> 1033.26]  the value of a,
[1033.30 --> 1036.94]  of a dedicated hardware button for that for me is extremely low,
[1037.76 --> 1038.70]  extremely low.
[1038.70 --> 1042.18]  There's still things that I'm super not impressed about.
[1042.34 --> 1042.74]  I mean,
[1042.78 --> 1047.14]  the fact that Apple's base storage is still 128 gigs.
[1047.36 --> 1049.80]  I was just going to talk about that.
[1050.08 --> 1054.02]  On devices that cost like a flipping ton of money.
[1054.16 --> 1057.52]  The fact that storage upgrades cost so much,
[1057.52 --> 1061.54]  $300 to go from 512 gigs to one terabyte.
[1061.72 --> 1062.48]  We did the math,
[1062.60 --> 1062.80]  Luke.
[1063.20 --> 1063.64]  Crazy.
[1063.92 --> 1071.18]  Apple literally charges so much that their NAND flash chips could be made of gold.
[1073.98 --> 1074.46]  Literally.
[1074.46 --> 1075.58]  We got,
[1075.68 --> 1075.84]  no,
[1075.92 --> 1076.40]  I'm serious.
[1076.70 --> 1077.02]  We,
[1077.10 --> 1077.32]  we,
[1077.32 --> 1083.10]  we grabbed some pieces of the golden controller and we compared them to like,
[1083.90 --> 1084.22]  like,
[1084.32 --> 1085.50]  like NAND chips.
[1085.74 --> 1086.84]  And like we,
[1086.96 --> 1092.16]  like we did the math and like how much gold it was to weigh as much as like Apple's NAND chips.
[1092.58 --> 1094.24]  And like wait for wait,
[1095.04 --> 1095.44]  Apple,
[1095.68 --> 1098.74]  Apple storage and memory costs as much as gold.
[1098.94 --> 1100.00]  Was this for a video?
[1100.16 --> 1100.38]  Yeah.
[1100.58 --> 1101.04]  I was going to say,
[1101.10 --> 1102.72]  why would you need the pieces from the gold?
[1102.72 --> 1103.12]  We were,
[1103.20 --> 1103.46]  it was,
[1103.56 --> 1106.78]  I believe it was from the other one and then look up gold value.
[1106.86 --> 1108.08]  I believe it was a,
[1108.20 --> 1108.46]  I believe,
[1108.62 --> 1108.74]  well,
[1108.80 --> 1108.90]  yeah,
[1108.94 --> 1110.74]  but we had the gold so we could do it.
[1111.14 --> 1111.78]  That's why I said,
[1111.84 --> 1112.34]  is it for a video?
[1112.38 --> 1114.28]  Cause it's for a video that it's a cool visual thing.
[1114.34 --> 1114.50]  Anyway.
[1114.60 --> 1114.74]  Yeah.
[1115.32 --> 1115.68]  Yeah.
[1115.68 --> 1116.28]  So it was,
[1116.40 --> 1117.02]  it was,
[1117.08 --> 1118.00]  it was freaking hilarious,
[1118.12 --> 1118.26]  right?
[1118.30 --> 1118.42]  Though,
[1118.46 --> 1120.00]  because it's,
[1120.08 --> 1121.12]  it's crazy.
[1121.32 --> 1123.52]  It's like when you compare printer ink to,
[1123.60 --> 1123.96]  you know,
[1124.02 --> 1125.88]  Chanel number,
[1126.16 --> 1126.50]  whatever,
[1126.72 --> 1126.94]  you know,
[1126.94 --> 1127.10]  like,
[1127.10 --> 1130.04]  like these obscenely valuable liquids.
[1130.34 --> 1130.64]  Funny enough,
[1130.68 --> 1131.66]  I watched that video.
[1132.72 --> 1133.32]  Oh,
[1133.62 --> 1134.92]  the like printer video.
[1135.00 --> 1135.10]  Yeah.
[1135.10 --> 1135.26]  Yeah.
[1135.34 --> 1135.54]  Yeah.
[1135.60 --> 1136.24]  I watched that one.
[1136.24 --> 1137.48]  You're one of the very few who did.
[1137.64 --> 1138.12]  It was a,
[1138.18 --> 1138.84]  I didn't watch the,
[1138.92 --> 1139.90]  the terrible performance.
[1140.22 --> 1140.82]  How'd you like it?
[1141.26 --> 1141.76]  I was actually,
[1141.82 --> 1142.26]  it was pretty good.
[1142.50 --> 1142.72]  Yeah.
[1143.72 --> 1146.80]  I didn't know about the whole tank thing and stuff.
[1146.98 --> 1149.58]  And there was one really mad comment that was saying,
[1149.72 --> 1152.32]  everyone knows you should just get an older laser printer.
[1153.62 --> 1154.92]  I had a bunch of upvotes.
[1154.92 --> 1156.26]  I get these questions all the time.
[1156.40 --> 1157.02]  And it's like,
[1157.02 --> 1158.02]  um,
[1158.10 --> 1158.58]  like genuinely,
[1158.92 --> 1159.30]  um,
[1159.30 --> 1160.18]  no,
[1160.18 --> 1160.30]  no,
[1160.30 --> 1160.42]  no,
[1160.42 --> 1160.52]  no,
[1160.52 --> 1160.64]  no,
[1160.64 --> 1160.72]  no,
[1160.72 --> 1160.78]  no,
[1160.78 --> 1160.86]  no.
[1160.86 --> 1161.28]  They were like,
[1161.34 --> 1162.44]  everyone knows like,
[1162.52 --> 1162.86]  like our,
[1162.86 --> 1163.90]  our advice was bad.
[1164.04 --> 1166.70]  They didn't get to the part of the video where we talked about that.
[1166.96 --> 1167.12]  Oh,
[1167.58 --> 1168.80]  very cool.
[1169.30 --> 1170.06]  I can't,
[1170.12 --> 1171.40]  I can't help people.
[1171.64 --> 1172.74]  I can't help them.
[1173.22 --> 1173.60]  Um,
[1174.66 --> 1174.92]  any,
[1175.06 --> 1175.46]  any who,
[1175.58 --> 1178.62]  so I'm,
[1178.68 --> 1180.02]  I'm kind of excited to try it,
[1180.06 --> 1182.12]  even though I'm definitely going to have some issues.
[1182.12 --> 1182.88]  Um,
[1183.48 --> 1189.76]  I don't think that having USB two speeds is going to bother me that much day to day.
[1189.88 --> 1190.26]  Uh,
[1190.26 --> 1191.64]  I very rarely offload.
[1191.80 --> 1197.06]  I noticed Plex actually USB two speeds on the 16 non pro it's USB two,
[1197.18 --> 1198.50]  even though it's USB C.
[1198.62 --> 1199.02]  Like,
[1199.08 --> 1199.30]  look,
[1199.38 --> 1202.66]  there's absolutely stuff that is going to make me mad,
[1202.84 --> 1204.58]  but how often do,
[1204.66 --> 1206.84]  when's the last time you offloaded photos from your phone via USB?
[1209.36 --> 1209.84]  Uh,
[1209.84 --> 1210.04]  yeah,
[1210.04 --> 1210.44]  that's fair.
[1210.44 --> 1213.64]  when's the last time you connected your phone to a computer via USB?
[1213.98 --> 1214.08]  Oh,
[1214.38 --> 1215.10]  decently often.
[1215.26 --> 1215.40]  Okay.
[1215.44 --> 1216.46]  To transfer files though?
[1216.58 --> 1216.76]  No.
[1217.52 --> 1217.90]  Okay.
[1218.04 --> 1218.70]  So who cares?
[1218.98 --> 1219.20]  Yeah.
[1220.84 --> 1221.64]  Who cares?
[1221.80 --> 1223.76]  I do think it's interesting.
[1224.90 --> 1227.42]  Do they have any color overlap?
[1227.52 --> 1227.72]  Oh,
[1227.76 --> 1228.34]  black and white.
[1228.50 --> 1228.82]  Okay.
[1229.50 --> 1230.30]  Crystal asks,
[1230.42 --> 1231.66]  will you miss your S pen?
[1231.98 --> 1234.72]  The answer is absolutely.
[1235.26 --> 1235.48]  Yeah.
[1235.54 --> 1236.64]  I have become,
[1236.64 --> 1237.88]  I've gone from,
[1238.10 --> 1240.22]  why are they taking up space in my,
[1240.22 --> 1246.12]  in my note with this stupid pen to whenever I want it?
[1246.18 --> 1249.70]  I really want it predominantly for marking up screenshots.
[1249.92 --> 1250.82]  Why don't you get a new note?
[1251.74 --> 1252.74]  Is it just Apple time?
[1252.92 --> 1253.06]  Yeah,
[1253.06 --> 1253.34]  I could.
[1253.42 --> 1253.94]  It's just time.
[1254.16 --> 1254.66]  Apple time.
[1254.78 --> 1254.92]  Yeah.
[1254.98 --> 1255.54]  It's just time.
[1256.48 --> 1256.92]  Um,
[1256.92 --> 1261.08]  so basically I think that's what it boils down to.
[1261.60 --> 1264.04]  And you know what the last part I think is,
[1264.54 --> 1265.26]  is,
[1265.76 --> 1266.28]  I mean,
[1266.28 --> 1267.66]  we've talked about this on the WAN show,
[1267.74 --> 1270.00]  so you guys will kind of be familiar with this already,
[1270.00 --> 1272.98]  but I'm so tired of negativity.
[1272.98 --> 1273.86]  Yeah.
[1275.12 --> 1275.68]  It's like,
[1275.74 --> 1282.32]  why do we have to compare it to last year's iPhone 15 and say it's not enough?
[1282.98 --> 1284.38]  What do you mean it's not enough?
[1284.94 --> 1286.06]  If it's not enough,
[1286.14 --> 1287.80]  then keep your iPhone 15.
[1287.98 --> 1288.16]  Yeah.
[1288.60 --> 1290.02]  That's totally fine.
[1290.30 --> 1292.12]  That's maybe even good.
[1292.28 --> 1292.84]  That's good.
[1293.26 --> 1293.58]  You just,
[1293.88 --> 1294.08]  yeah,
[1294.48 --> 1294.86]  who cares?
[1294.86 --> 1295.22]  If,
[1295.28 --> 1295.90]  if anything,
[1296.22 --> 1297.04]  I would actually,
[1297.34 --> 1298.20]  now that our,
[1298.26 --> 1299.42]  our mobile processors,
[1299.72 --> 1300.56]  especially apples,
[1300.76 --> 1304.44]  are fast enough to do pretty much whatever we could need to do on our phone,
[1304.56 --> 1305.36]  reasonably speaking,
[1305.36 --> 1310.78]  I would actually love to see less frequent upgrades and longer software support or,
[1310.90 --> 1311.04]  you know,
[1311.08 --> 1311.80]  whatever that looks like,
[1311.80 --> 1317.88]  because you got to remember Apple is driven somewhat differently from other phone manufacturers.
[1318.56 --> 1322.74]  They are a lot less motivated by the initial sale of the iPhone.
[1322.86 --> 1323.28]  To be clear.
[1323.40 --> 1323.50]  Oh,
[1323.56 --> 1324.50]  they're happy to grab it.
[1324.50 --> 1325.86]  They're happy to take your money.
[1326.02 --> 1326.20]  Yeah.
[1326.34 --> 1335.22]  But they are far more motivated by the size of the iOS ecosystem and the number of people that are buying stupid,
[1335.42 --> 1335.58]  man,
[1336.94 --> 1338.12]  Yvonne picked up wordscapes,
[1339.12 --> 1340.26]  like the mobile,
[1340.26 --> 1340.70]  like,
[1341.02 --> 1341.10]  yeah,
[1341.22 --> 1341.76]  like word,
[1341.96 --> 1342.40]  crossword,
[1342.52 --> 1342.90]  spelling,
[1343.00 --> 1343.70]  de-jumble thing.
[1344.00 --> 1344.14]  Sure.
[1344.20 --> 1345.76]  And I've been playing with her sometimes.
[1346.80 --> 1347.28]  Dude.
[1348.54 --> 1349.02]  Dude.
[1349.22 --> 1350.94]  The lengths that they go to.
[1350.94 --> 1353.84]  We're both getting into playing boomer games with our partners.
[1353.84 --> 1354.54]  Nice.
[1354.54 --> 1355.32]  What is happening?
[1355.52 --> 1357.82]  I play the New York time games with Emma.
[1357.82 --> 1357.98]  Oh,
[1358.06 --> 1358.98]  Wordle or whatever it is?
[1358.98 --> 1359.00]  Yeah,
[1359.08 --> 1359.66]  those things.
[1359.90 --> 1361.48]  And you play wordscapes?
[1361.70 --> 1361.96]  Yeah.
[1362.76 --> 1363.66]  How the mighty fall.
[1363.78 --> 1364.12]  Nice.
[1364.18 --> 1364.56]  I know,
[1364.62 --> 1364.82]  right?
[1364.82 --> 1366.80]  We used to be true gamers.
[1367.36 --> 1370.84]  I used to play Left 4 Dead 2 with my posture like this,
[1370.84 --> 1371.16]  boys.
[1373.16 --> 1373.56]  Oh,
[1373.56 --> 1373.92]  boy.
[1374.20 --> 1374.40]  Sorry,
[1374.50 --> 1374.84]  keep going.
[1376.14 --> 1376.40]  Ooh.
[1376.70 --> 1377.28]  I heard that.
[1377.34 --> 1377.48]  Yeah,
[1377.60 --> 1377.84]  so,
[1377.84 --> 1378.14]  so,
[1378.14 --> 1378.36]  so,
[1378.44 --> 1379.86]  so we've been playing wordscapes lately.
[1380.00 --> 1380.08]  Dude,
[1380.16 --> 1381.58]  the length that they go to,
[1381.70 --> 1383.18]  to extract money from you.
[1383.32 --> 1383.48]  Oh,
[1383.50 --> 1383.84]  I'm sure.
[1383.96 --> 1386.66]  Apple gets a piece of every one of those transactions.
[1387.32 --> 1388.20]  At the end of the day,
[1388.28 --> 1391.74]  the most important thing to you is that you are on an iPhone.
[1393.28 --> 1395.50]  Not necessarily that you are on the latest iPhone,
[1395.66 --> 1396.94]  but that you are on an iPhone.
[1397.26 --> 1398.90]  Because the bigger the install base is,
[1399.08 --> 1400.78]  the more of that sweet,
[1400.92 --> 1403.02]  sweet app store money they're extracting from you,
[1403.08 --> 1405.14]  and the more incentivized app developers are
[1405.14 --> 1408.64]  to continue to prioritize the iOS platform.
[1409.14 --> 1409.40]  So,
[1409.40 --> 1413.30]  I forget where I was going with this.
[1413.66 --> 1414.54]  What was my last reason?
[1415.38 --> 1415.80]  I forget.
[1415.92 --> 1416.40]  It doesn't matter.
[1416.74 --> 1420.06]  Let's talk about the PlayStation 5 Pro announcement.
[1420.24 --> 1421.28]  This was a little more recent,
[1421.28 --> 1423.54]  so I'm going to remember all the details a little bit better.
[1423.66 --> 1423.78]  But,
[1424.12 --> 1425.02]  in a nutshell,
[1425.56 --> 1426.92]  Sony upgraded the GPU.
[1427.66 --> 1429.14]  I was a little surprised.
[1429.72 --> 1429.96]  Oh,
[1430.02 --> 1431.42]  we also get Wi-Fi 7,
[1431.90 --> 1433.32]  higher base storage.
[1434.66 --> 1436.02]  I'm trying to think if there's,
[1436.04 --> 1437.62]  if there's anything else that
[1437.62 --> 1440.00]  was really upgraded,
[1440.10 --> 1442.22]  going from the PS5 to the PS5 Pro,
[1442.38 --> 1443.24]  and I don't think so.
[1443.66 --> 1443.88]  There,
[1443.98 --> 1445.98]  there were some things I was a little surprised by.
[1446.42 --> 1449.38]  I didn't expect the CPU to stay Zen 2.
[1449.88 --> 1450.10]  Yeah.
[1450.50 --> 1452.44]  Already when the PS5 came out,
[1452.58 --> 1453.66]  I remember it,
[1453.78 --> 1454.90]  I remember feeling like,
[1455.10 --> 1455.54]  oh yeah,
[1455.60 --> 1456.98]  it makes sense that it's Zen 2,
[1457.06 --> 1460.34]  because the development cycle for this is so long,
[1460.50 --> 1462.44]  that it would have had to be,
[1462.62 --> 1463.46]  but boy,
[1463.56 --> 1465.28]  would it ever have been nice if they,
[1465.52 --> 1465.78]  you know,
[1465.78 --> 1467.94]  if the dev kits were all Zen 2,
[1468.08 --> 1468.82]  and it was like,
[1469.10 --> 1470.62]  Zen 3 for the real product,
[1470.76 --> 1471.34]  you know.
[1472.10 --> 1472.50]  So,
[1472.60 --> 1475.14]  I was a little surprised to see Zen 2 stick around,
[1475.58 --> 1479.24]  but it also kind of makes sense.
[1480.02 --> 1480.40]  Wait,
[1480.52 --> 1480.84]  hold on,
[1480.90 --> 1481.76]  what's going on here?
[1482.14 --> 1482.30]  Okay,
[1482.32 --> 1482.58]  hold on,
[1482.62 --> 1483.90]  we'll get to the PS5 Pro in a second.
[1485.00 --> 1485.72]  Shrafk to,
[1486.10 --> 1487.26]  in Floatplane Chat says,
[1487.46 --> 1487.74]  Linus,
[1487.76 --> 1489.22]  this is such a disconnected take.
[1489.52 --> 1490.78]  When a product costs $1,200,
[1491.24 --> 1492.94]  and there's no improvement to justify it,
[1492.94 --> 1494.44]  that's when we should be negative.
[1494.68 --> 1496.34]  This is a consumer protection issue.
[1498.10 --> 1498.50]  No.
[1499.82 --> 1500.54]  Not at all.
[1500.54 --> 1504.24]  A consumer protection issue would be if Apple tells you it's something that it isn't.
[1504.32 --> 1504.58]  Yeah.
[1504.92 --> 1510.10]  A consumer protection issue would be if Apple deactivates your iPhone 15 Pro,
[1510.10 --> 1513.14]  and forces you to buy an iPhone 16 Pro.
[1513.24 --> 1514.76]  You are not compelled to buy this.
[1514.82 --> 1515.62]  This is not food,
[1516.00 --> 1516.86]  it's not shelter,
[1517.22 --> 1518.08]  it's not water.
[1519.10 --> 1520.34]  It's a f***ing iPhone.
[1520.54 --> 1522.10]  But if you have a 15,
[1522.40 --> 1523.86]  or especially like a 15 Pro,
[1524.42 --> 1526.20]  you don't need a new phone.
[1526.32 --> 1526.56]  Yeah.
[1527.52 --> 1529.12]  Which is not a bad thing.
[1529.50 --> 1529.64]  Like,
[1529.72 --> 1532.40]  that's the biggest take from the event,
[1532.94 --> 1533.46]  from me,
[1533.54 --> 1534.82]  is that you don't need it.
[1535.06 --> 1536.16]  And I am certain,
[1536.50 --> 1537.26]  honestly,
[1537.32 --> 1538.22]  it might have even already happened,
[1538.30 --> 1539.48]  because I just don't care that much,
[1539.48 --> 1542.24]  because I'm not going to upgrade my phone.
[1542.62 --> 1542.76]  Yeah.
[1543.08 --> 1545.06]  But whatever new Pixel announcement,
[1545.54 --> 1546.66]  I'm not upgrading to it.
[1546.70 --> 1546.96]  So like,
[1546.98 --> 1548.22]  I don't even really care what it is.
[1548.40 --> 1553.44]  What I'm looking for is going to end up being like the Pixel 10 or 11.
[1553.84 --> 1554.08]  Yeah.
[1554.26 --> 1555.24]  When that launches,
[1555.40 --> 1558.86]  I'm going to be evaluating that versus whatever iPhone is launching at the same time,
[1558.90 --> 1560.92]  in comparison to the phone that I currently have,
[1560.92 --> 1561.68]  and deciding,
[1562.08 --> 1563.52]  am I going to get a battery replacement,
[1563.78 --> 1565.28]  or am I going to buy one of these phones?
[1565.50 --> 1565.66]  Yeah.
[1565.72 --> 1566.80]  And then I'm interested in it.
[1566.80 --> 1567.54]  So basically,
[1568.06 --> 1568.64]  back to,
[1568.78 --> 1569.98]  back to my point of,
[1569.98 --> 1571.76]  us being more focused on,
[1571.90 --> 1572.28]  like,
[1572.38 --> 1573.64]  the positive aspects.
[1573.98 --> 1574.56]  Remember too,
[1574.64 --> 1574.82]  guys,
[1574.88 --> 1575.66]  this isn't a review.
[1576.00 --> 1578.16]  This is a summary of a product announcement.
[1578.46 --> 1578.68]  So,
[1579.28 --> 1579.78]  obviously,
[1580.08 --> 1581.36]  I'm going to talk about the highlights.
[1582.02 --> 1584.08]  Why do I want to drag myself down?
[1584.32 --> 1587.10]  Why do I want to drag everything down by dwelling on the negative?
[1587.60 --> 1588.70]  And at the end of the day,
[1589.02 --> 1591.28]  if it's not a big enough upgrade over last gen,
[1591.70 --> 1591.84]  well,
[1591.88 --> 1592.36]  that's fine.
[1592.36 --> 1594.30]  Because Apple's not targeting last gen.
[1595.40 --> 1597.26]  They're not selling it to last gen.
[1597.80 --> 1598.72]  The question is not,
[1599.08 --> 1600.32]  the question is not,
[1600.54 --> 1604.92]  is $1,200 compelling enough for someone who already owns an iPhone 15 Pro?
[1605.36 --> 1606.76]  That's a stupid question.
[1607.12 --> 1608.28]  Because it's not $1,200.
[1608.92 --> 1611.80]  It's $1,200 minus whatever you could sell your 15 Pro for.
[1612.04 --> 1613.20]  That's the actual value.
[1613.30 --> 1613.60]  And that,
[1613.68 --> 1613.96]  I don't know,
[1614.00 --> 1614.52]  that's up to you.
[1614.58 --> 1616.48]  I have no idea what they're worth in the secondary market.
[1616.72 --> 1617.94]  You can go figure that out.
[1617.94 --> 1619.12]  The question is,
[1619.24 --> 1622.56]  is $1,200 worth it for someone who needs a phone?
[1624.02 --> 1624.38]  And so,
[1624.54 --> 1626.04]  I think that's the difference.
[1626.04 --> 1626.70]  And it looks like,
[1626.78 --> 1628.20]  just on the surface to me,
[1628.32 --> 1628.50]  like,
[1628.58 --> 1629.16]  it looks like,
[1629.22 --> 1629.36]  yeah,
[1629.56 --> 1629.82]  probably.
[1630.10 --> 1633.90]  That's the difference in perspective that I want to start approaching things with,
[1633.92 --> 1638.64]  is as someone who is the actual target market for this product.
[1639.32 --> 1639.72]  Okay.
[1639.94 --> 1640.16]  So,
[1640.20 --> 1641.36]  let's go back to the PS5 Pro.
[1641.58 --> 1641.76]  So,
[1641.82 --> 1643.56]  the main things are it's got a better GPU,
[1644.20 --> 1645.60]  similar architecture,
[1645.74 --> 1646.96]  which again surprised me.
[1647.02 --> 1647.68]  Because we've got to remember,
[1647.68 --> 1650.62]  this product launched four years ago,
[1650.68 --> 1651.50]  I think it works out too,
[1651.54 --> 1651.66]  right?
[1652.22 --> 1653.44]  PS5 came out in 2020.
[1655.12 --> 1656.92]  PS5 released it.
[1658.98 --> 1659.34]  PS5,
[1659.42 --> 1659.58]  no,
[1659.68 --> 1661.12]  not the slim,
[1661.24 --> 1661.94]  or was it 2022?
[1662.92 --> 1663.12]  Yeah,
[1663.34 --> 1663.72]  November,
[1664.14 --> 1665.34]  November 2020
[1665.34 --> 1667.78]  was when the PS5 launched.
[1667.92 --> 1668.04]  So,
[1668.52 --> 1669.88]  four years later,
[1669.94 --> 1671.02]  I was kind of expecting,
[1671.18 --> 1671.38]  you know,
[1671.88 --> 1672.34]  I don't know,
[1672.44 --> 1673.02]  Zen 3,
[1673.38 --> 1674.20]  at the very least.
[1674.54 --> 1677.54]  I was expecting an architectural change to the GPU,
[1677.68 --> 1678.54]  but then,
[1678.88 --> 1681.82]  as I was sort of working through the script with David,
[1682.24 --> 1682.76]  I was like,
[1682.92 --> 1683.26]  no,
[1683.44 --> 1685.00]  it actually makes sense.
[1685.52 --> 1686.00]  Because,
[1686.68 --> 1688.40]  from Sony's perspective,
[1688.56 --> 1689.90]  the most important thing,
[1690.28 --> 1691.86]  because this is a mid-cycle refresh,
[1692.06 --> 1692.82]  that realistically,
[1693.40 --> 1695.94]  they aren't going to sell a ton of.
[1696.22 --> 1696.42]  Yeah.
[1696.42 --> 1699.62]  Especially if you compare this to base PS5s,
[1699.62 --> 1700.66]  or PS4s,
[1700.66 --> 1700.78]  right?
[1700.82 --> 1702.64]  These pro models are,
[1703.00 --> 1704.52]  for their more affluent customers,
[1704.68 --> 1704.94]  therefore,
[1705.08 --> 1705.44]  they're more,
[1705.74 --> 1708.12]  the more discerning console gamer,
[1708.26 --> 1708.50]  right?
[1708.94 --> 1709.28]  You know,
[1709.52 --> 1710.30]  Sips T like this,
[1710.36 --> 1710.48]  right?
[1710.54 --> 1711.12]  Who can,
[1711.22 --> 1713.64]  who can definitely see the difference in the pixels,
[1713.86 --> 1714.00]  or,
[1714.22 --> 1714.42]  you know,
[1714.50 --> 1714.88]  realistically,
[1715.04 --> 1716.04]  who can see the higher,
[1716.16 --> 1716.82]  higher refresh,
[1716.88 --> 1717.60]  higher frame rates.
[1717.60 --> 1718.58]  Um,
[1719.62 --> 1719.88]  so,
[1720.02 --> 1724.24]  making sure that developers have continuity between the regular model,
[1724.40 --> 1725.70]  and between the pro model,
[1725.88 --> 1730.64]  is way more important than squeezing a little bit more performance out of it.
[1731.32 --> 1731.72]  Um,
[1731.96 --> 1732.60]  Wi-Fi 7,
[1732.68 --> 1732.90]  I think,
[1732.94 --> 1734.76]  is actually a pretty important upgrade,
[1734.76 --> 1737.64]  that is maybe not being talked about enough,
[1737.78 --> 1738.74]  especially by us.
[1739.26 --> 1739.62]  Um,
[1739.96 --> 1740.16]  like,
[1740.20 --> 1742.90]  we turned that video around extremely quickly,
[1742.90 --> 1743.64]  and so,
[1743.78 --> 1747.38]  there were a couple things that I think weren't necessarily wrong,
[1747.38 --> 1749.92]  but are things that I would probably want to do differently to go back.
[1750.00 --> 1751.20]  I would talk about Wi-Fi 7,
[1751.64 --> 1754.32]  and especially in the PlayStation ecosystem,
[1754.32 --> 1756.12]  where you might have a PS portal,
[1756.80 --> 1760.58]  and your PlayStation 5 Pro is not connected via Ethernet.
[1760.78 --> 1763.02]  Having Wi-Fi 7 and a Wi-Fi 7 router,
[1763.74 --> 1766.94]  even if your PS portal doesn't support Wi-Fi 7,
[1767.18 --> 1767.82]  which it doesn't,
[1767.98 --> 1768.72]  because it's a PS portal,
[1769.14 --> 1769.46]  um,
[1769.46 --> 1774.08]  it would be better to have a stronger connection between the PS5 Pro and your router.
[1774.24 --> 1774.32]  It's,
[1774.32 --> 1774.92]  it's still,
[1775.08 --> 1775.86]  it's still better.
[1775.86 --> 1777.86]  The better every link in the chain can be,
[1777.92 --> 1779.54]  the better off you're going to be.
[1779.64 --> 1779.72]  So,
[1779.82 --> 1781.52]  Wi-Fi 7 is something I would have talked about more.
[1781.92 --> 1786.50]  I also would have more explicitly talked about the lack of a disk drive.
[1786.92 --> 1787.14]  Uh,
[1787.14 --> 1788.36]  that was something that we just,
[1788.46 --> 1789.66]  we kind of glossed over.
[1789.82 --> 1791.02]  And at the very beginning,
[1791.40 --> 1792.30]  we had a bit where,
[1792.60 --> 1792.80]  you know,
[1792.84 --> 1794.20]  by the time you buy a stand,
[1794.80 --> 1795.22]  and,
[1795.30 --> 1799.74]  I think David and I had talked about how the visuals should also have the disk drive,
[1799.78 --> 1800.20]  and it should just,
[1800.30 --> 1800.34]  like,
[1800.36 --> 1802.14]  add up the whole price and compare it to a thing.
[1802.14 --> 1802.80]  Because we,
[1802.80 --> 1804.08]  we said something along the lines of,
[1804.24 --> 1804.28]  like,
[1804.76 --> 1806.32]  by the time you buy a disk drive,
[1806.42 --> 1810.70]  this thing costs darn near twice as much as a base model PlayStation.
[1811.22 --> 1811.58]  Or,
[1811.74 --> 1812.44]  costs about twice,
[1812.56 --> 1812.74]  or,
[1812.88 --> 1814.74]  I forget exactly how we worded it.
[1815.00 --> 1815.36]  And,
[1815.44 --> 1818.14]  I probably would have expanded on that more later.
[1819.28 --> 1819.68]  Uh,
[1819.68 --> 1824.66]  because I think that people were pretty upset when they felt like we were justifying the price.
[1824.66 --> 1828.86]  when we talked about how it wasn't Sony's most expensive console ever.
[1829.82 --> 1830.98]  That crown actually,
[1831.22 --> 1832.08]  corrected for inflation,
[1832.34 --> 1833.46]  goes to the PS3.
[1834.34 --> 1834.78]  Uh,
[1834.82 --> 1836.28]  which came out at $599,
[1836.62 --> 1837.82]  but that was back in,
[1838.38 --> 1838.58]  man,
[1838.62 --> 1839.54]  when did the PS3 come out?
[1839.64 --> 1839.76]  Like,
[1839.80 --> 1840.28]  2002?
[1841.86 --> 1842.40]  Oh boy,
[1842.50 --> 1843.28]  I'm gonna get this wrong.
[1843.40 --> 1843.84]  2006.
[1844.26 --> 1844.48]  Okay,
[1844.66 --> 1846.36]  so that came out way back in 2006.
[1848.58 --> 1850.84]  I said I'd touch on inflation.
[1850.84 --> 1858.04]  Quite a few people were really upset that we made a with inflation comparison to the PS3.
[1858.24 --> 1860.44]  And I'd like to explain why we did that.
[1860.74 --> 1863.00]  And the reason they were upset was because,
[1863.20 --> 1864.16]  and I get this,
[1864.66 --> 1871.22]  people are sick of seeing a price justified today because of inflation.
[1872.12 --> 1872.62]  Well,
[1872.68 --> 1877.40]  it's reasonable for it to be $700 because if you compare that to $500 for the PS3,
[1878.20 --> 1879.00]  inflationarily,
[1879.52 --> 1880.44]  they're very similar.
[1880.44 --> 1880.86]  In fact,
[1880.96 --> 1881.10]  that,
[1881.20 --> 1883.06]  that was more dollars back then.
[1883.72 --> 1885.06]  But that wasn't what we were saying.
[1885.42 --> 1887.08]  We weren't trying to justify the price.
[1887.18 --> 1887.36]  In fact,
[1887.42 --> 1888.32]  the very opening of the video.
[1888.32 --> 1889.62]  Because wages haven't scaled with inflation.
[1889.88 --> 1890.32]  I'll get to,
[1890.40 --> 1890.64]  yes,
[1890.70 --> 1891.30]  I'll get to that.
[1891.52 --> 1893.50]  We weren't trying to justify the price though.
[1893.58 --> 1894.54]  What we were saying was,
[1894.66 --> 1896.50]  there's a precedent for this.
[1897.50 --> 1898.42]  That's what we were saying.
[1898.48 --> 1900.80]  This isn't their most expensive console.
[1900.80 --> 1900.88]  So,
[1901.02 --> 1903.76]  is that like one of the communication things that you would have wanted to change?
[1903.86 --> 1905.34]  I would have wanted to clarify that.
[1905.68 --> 1908.10]  And I can see why people are upset about it because,
[1908.40 --> 1908.64]  yeah,
[1908.64 --> 1912.72]  their wages haven't flipping scaled with inflation.
[1912.72 --> 1912.74]  So,
[1913.06 --> 1916.72]  the buying power of that much money is not the same,
[1916.88 --> 1919.22]  even if it's the same inflationary wise.
[1919.36 --> 1920.00]  Exactly.
[1920.00 --> 1921.70]  However,
[1922.22 --> 1927.24]  something that I feel like a lot of people overlook in stuff like this,
[1927.28 --> 1930.06]  is that the costing of a product from a company,
[1930.18 --> 1932.48]  from a consumer electronics company like Sony,
[1932.84 --> 1936.92]  is contingent on their costs for their sourcing.
[1938.50 --> 1941.28]  Do you think Sony makes power supplies?
[1942.56 --> 1945.98]  Does Sony have a power supply manufacturing plant?
[1945.98 --> 1947.08]  Do you think it's that?
[1947.16 --> 1949.68]  I think it's more that there's no competition really in the space.
[1949.84 --> 1950.72]  We talk about that.
[1950.82 --> 1951.00]  Okay.
[1951.12 --> 1951.14]  But,
[1951.14 --> 1951.80]  I just want to,
[1951.82 --> 1954.92]  I just want to talk about the importance of why this inflation number matters.
[1955.80 --> 1959.04]  Sony buys power supplies from light on.
[1959.30 --> 1961.58]  And those power supplies cost more now than they used to.
[1961.68 --> 1961.74]  Yeah.
[1961.84 --> 1964.68]  Because commodity prices have gone up in inflation.
[1964.94 --> 1965.12]  Yeah.
[1965.46 --> 1968.48]  Do you think Sony manufactures microprocessors?
[1968.48 --> 1969.48]  No.
[1971.94 --> 1975.54]  Do you think Sony has their own iron mines?
[1976.50 --> 1980.40]  Where they get iron to make steel?
[1980.62 --> 1981.56]  If we were talking about Samsung,
[1981.78 --> 1981.96]  maybe,
[1982.10 --> 1982.46]  who knows,
[1982.58 --> 1983.14]  they do everything.
[1983.28 --> 1983.72]  That's true,
[1983.80 --> 1984.18]  but we're not.
[1984.18 --> 1984.62]  But Sony,
[1984.70 --> 1984.86]  no.
[1985.30 --> 1987.22]  Does Sony manufacture DRAM?
[1987.60 --> 1987.88]  No.
[1988.88 --> 1990.20]  Sony is,
[1990.34 --> 1991.28]  they're a designer,
[1991.92 --> 1996.40]  but they don't actually manufacture just about any of the,
[1996.40 --> 1997.08]  of the raw,
[1997.72 --> 2000.10]  of the raw materials of a PlayStation five.
[2000.20 --> 2001.48]  Like certainly they're doing board assembly.
[2001.72 --> 2004.30]  And just like M hop pointed out in full plane chat.
[2004.40 --> 2005.72]  Fab time is huge right now.
[2006.64 --> 2008.32]  Fab time is crazy right now.
[2008.54 --> 2009.34]  Ranma Chan says,
[2009.40 --> 2012.70]  I saw a chart yesterday that showed how much TSMC is essentially gouging
[2012.70 --> 2014.30]  companies due to manufacturing capacity.
[2014.30 --> 2014.80]  And it's rough.
[2014.90 --> 2018.00]  And that was why the second thing I said was microprocessors.
[2018.14 --> 2018.26]  Yeah.
[2018.30 --> 2019.50]  Sony doesn't make microprocessors.
[2019.86 --> 2020.76]  We are,
[2021.02 --> 2025.48]  we are in an environment right now where there's an effective monopoly on
[2025.48 --> 2027.68]  cutting edge node microprocessors.
[2028.48 --> 2032.32]  As much as it's been kind of hilarious for people who hate Intel,
[2032.46 --> 2036.44]  many of whom are justified to watch them struggle with the rollout of their
[2036.44 --> 2037.30]  fab business.
[2038.54 --> 2042.94]  We should be rooting for them because Samsung has proven time and time again
[2042.94 --> 2045.06]  that they're just not going to catch TSMC.
[2045.16 --> 2045.80]  Here's a hot take.
[2045.88 --> 2046.14]  Then again,
[2046.18 --> 2046.66]  so is Intel.
[2048.16 --> 2049.78]  I'm surprised they're as cheap as there.
[2049.78 --> 2053.30]  With how few people can make them cough,
[2053.40 --> 2054.64]  cough one place.
[2057.84 --> 2061.92]  I think we're lucky that they're not making it way worse.
[2062.50 --> 2066.18]  And maybe they're not making it way worse because they know other companies
[2066.18 --> 2069.62]  would then have more opportunity to spring into the space and they would
[2069.62 --> 2071.24]  rather there's less people competing.
[2071.38 --> 2073.76]  So they're happy to take their really significant cut,
[2073.84 --> 2075.26]  significant cut that they are,
[2075.26 --> 2078.00]  but they have an effective monopoly on cutting edge chips.
[2078.36 --> 2081.60]  And the fact that they're not like just astronomically more expensive is,
[2081.76 --> 2082.30]  I think we're.
[2083.12 --> 2083.52]  Yeah.
[2083.52 --> 2084.72]  I remember seeing a quote from,
[2084.86 --> 2087.12]  I think it was TSMC's chairman or something like that.
[2087.18 --> 2092.02]  Basically making the observation that NVIDIA is sure charging a lot for these
[2092.02 --> 2092.80]  AI processors.
[2093.88 --> 2094.16]  Yeah.
[2094.40 --> 2094.62]  Yeah.
[2094.62 --> 2095.40]  I don't remember that quote,
[2095.44 --> 2096.50]  but I know what you're talking about.
[2096.70 --> 2097.00]  Yeah.
[2097.28 --> 2097.58]  Like,
[2097.66 --> 2097.88]  huh,
[2098.00 --> 2100.68]  we could take more of that because who else is going to make it?
[2100.76 --> 2101.00]  Nobody.
[2101.24 --> 2101.72]  No one.
[2101.96 --> 2102.28]  No one.
[2102.28 --> 2103.58]  Like they,
[2103.58 --> 2104.06]  they could,
[2104.18 --> 2105.94]  they could effectively charge,
[2106.06 --> 2106.96]  you know,
[2106.98 --> 2107.82]  there's limits to this,
[2107.88 --> 2110.46]  but practically anything for certain product lines that like,
[2110.50 --> 2110.76]  you know,
[2111.06 --> 2113.60]  a government is not going to just not buy it.
[2114.02 --> 2114.50]  Yep.
[2114.66 --> 2115.24]  So like,
[2115.28 --> 2115.88]  I don't know.
[2115.94 --> 2116.38]  I think,
[2116.46 --> 2116.74]  yeah,
[2117.04 --> 2118.44]  I think the fact that you can buy,
[2118.54 --> 2121.08]  go out and buy a very respectable,
[2121.34 --> 2124.78]  super solid CPU for your computer for like a hundred bucks is,
[2125.14 --> 2130.56]  and it's from a monopoly that you're also going through middlemen for is wild.
[2130.56 --> 2131.16]  Like,
[2131.56 --> 2131.80]  yeah,
[2131.94 --> 2132.40]  I don't know.
[2133.68 --> 2134.04]  Yeah.
[2134.36 --> 2135.56]  So I think,
[2135.64 --> 2136.10]  um,
[2136.92 --> 2138.40]  they're cheap because they're a loss leader.
[2138.58 --> 2139.60]  You buy the console,
[2139.92 --> 2140.42]  uh,
[2140.42 --> 2142.12]  and Sony gets the licenses when you sell the games.
[2142.22 --> 2143.32]  They have no competition right now,
[2143.32 --> 2144.62]  but you don't decide that.
[2144.80 --> 2145.26]  That too.
[2145.62 --> 2146.64]  That's not up to you.
[2146.88 --> 2147.12]  Yeah.
[2147.14 --> 2148.52]  And when there is no competition,
[2148.52 --> 2150.44]  there's no real reason for them to do that.
[2150.94 --> 2151.24]  Yep.
[2151.84 --> 2152.70]  And who's,
[2152.70 --> 2155.62]  who's competing with the PlayStation five pro right now,
[2156.32 --> 2156.64]  Microsoft.
[2158.10 --> 2158.50]  Yeah.
[2159.02 --> 2159.30]  No.
[2159.30 --> 2161.58]  Not even a little bit.
[2161.94 --> 2162.24]  My,
[2162.32 --> 2166.12]  my understanding is the rumors that Microsoft has actually canned their mid
[2166.12 --> 2167.02]  generation refresh.
[2167.18 --> 2169.28]  I don't know if that will end up being true or if that's even,
[2169.54 --> 2171.16]  or if that's even the recent rumor mill.
[2171.80 --> 2172.14]  Um,
[2172.74 --> 2176.90]  but Sony is effectively competing against absolutely nobody.
[2177.12 --> 2181.34]  And what they're selling is an experience that only has a value to those
[2181.34 --> 2182.74]  few who value it.
[2182.74 --> 2185.86]  And back to our conversation about the,
[2186.02 --> 2186.62]  about the iPhone.
[2186.62 --> 2188.70]  Cause I think that in both cases,
[2188.70 --> 2192.08]  a lot of the criticism of our coverage came down to the same thing.
[2193.10 --> 2193.62]  Guys,
[2194.10 --> 2198.30]  Sony is not selling PlayStation five owners,
[2198.30 --> 2200.08]  a $700 upgrade.
[2201.08 --> 2204.16]  Sony is selling people who want to buy a console,
[2204.54 --> 2206.36]  a $700 console.
[2207.36 --> 2208.88]  And if you want a disc version,
[2209.04 --> 2209.22]  yeah,
[2209.26 --> 2212.16]  you're going to have to pay another 80 bucks for an add on,
[2212.26 --> 2213.52]  for an add on disc drive.
[2214.36 --> 2214.84]  Dude,
[2214.88 --> 2217.50]  the writing's been on the wall for game discs forever.
[2218.22 --> 2219.78]  I think this is,
[2219.78 --> 2222.16]  and it's the last generation with this drives.
[2222.62 --> 2223.58]  Oh man.
[2225.58 --> 2226.50]  I hope not.
[2226.90 --> 2227.34]  Yeah.
[2227.48 --> 2228.18]  I hope not.
[2228.26 --> 2228.54]  Me too.
[2230.14 --> 2230.58]  No,
[2230.84 --> 2232.82]  I think we're going to get one more.
[2233.60 --> 2235.78]  I think PlayStation six has a disc drive,
[2235.90 --> 2237.60]  but I think that it is,
[2237.70 --> 2239.06]  I think that it is,
[2239.10 --> 2242.30]  it moves to this add on model that we have now.
[2242.30 --> 2244.96]  And I think they de-emphasize it extremely heavily.
[2244.96 --> 2247.18]  And then I don't think PlayStation seven has one.
[2248.48 --> 2249.04]  Um,
[2249.18 --> 2249.42]  okay.
[2249.50 --> 2249.62]  Well,
[2249.68 --> 2249.84]  sorry.
[2249.90 --> 2250.44]  What was I saying?
[2250.60 --> 2250.78]  Right.
[2250.86 --> 2251.28]  So they're,
[2251.28 --> 2251.92]  so right.
[2252.02 --> 2252.16]  So,
[2252.28 --> 2256.10]  so they're selling a $700 PlayStation to someone who wants a PlayStation five,
[2256.24 --> 2257.54]  but like a bit better.
[2258.66 --> 2262.46]  And if you were have a PlayStation five and you were going to upgrade to it,
[2262.54 --> 2263.68]  you wouldn't be paying $700.
[2264.36 --> 2267.04]  You would be selling your PlayStation five and you'd be paying whatever the
[2267.04 --> 2267.50]  difference is.
[2267.54 --> 2270.90]  So you'd probably get a few hundred bucks for your PS five and you'd pay $400 or
[2270.90 --> 2271.18]  whatever,
[2271.18 --> 2275.20]  which if we're being realistic four years into this product's life cycle,
[2275.20 --> 2279.40]  it's not a ridiculous amount of money.
[2279.52 --> 2280.32]  I wouldn't pay it.
[2280.58 --> 2280.76]  No,
[2280.82 --> 2283.62]  I have personally never bought a PlayStation.
[2284.58 --> 2285.24]  That's not true.
[2286.32 --> 2287.82]  You never bought a current gen PlayStation.
[2288.60 --> 2288.96]  No,
[2289.00 --> 2289.76]  I've never bought a PlayStation.
[2290.32 --> 2292.02]  I was given a PlayStation two.
[2292.26 --> 2292.74]  Oh,
[2293.12 --> 2293.90]  you were given that?
[2293.96 --> 2294.06]  Yeah,
[2294.08 --> 2294.60]  I own it.
[2294.82 --> 2295.24]  Darn it.
[2295.36 --> 2296.36]  But I didn't buy it.
[2296.42 --> 2296.64]  All right.
[2296.70 --> 2297.04]  Fair enough.
[2297.14 --> 2297.96]  Cause I knew you had one.
[2298.00 --> 2298.14]  Yeah.
[2298.14 --> 2298.80]  I got a PS two.
[2298.88 --> 2299.16]  All right.
[2299.16 --> 2299.34]  Fair.
[2299.34 --> 2301.48]  I thought I got you.
[2301.58 --> 2301.70]  No,
[2301.74 --> 2302.14]  it was a gift.
[2302.82 --> 2303.14]  Um,
[2303.94 --> 2304.34]  okay.
[2304.46 --> 2305.14]  So question,
[2305.30 --> 2307.22]  I'm jumping off topic from PlayStation.
[2307.74 --> 2309.20]  Do you have anything else to say about PlayStation?
[2309.42 --> 2309.66]  No,
[2309.74 --> 2310.00]  just,
[2310.12 --> 2310.36]  uh,
[2310.36 --> 2313.74]  just we're evaluating it from the perspective of someone who's interested in
[2313.74 --> 2314.22]  buying it.
[2314.48 --> 2317.14]  And I think that's something that our viewers are just going to have to get
[2317.14 --> 2317.56]  used to.
[2317.82 --> 2322.68]  We are not evaluating it from the perspective of someone who hates consoles and
[2322.68 --> 2323.42]  thinks they're stupid.
[2323.66 --> 2323.98]  Yeah.
[2324.14 --> 2324.48]  Um,
[2324.48 --> 2324.84]  and we're,
[2324.90 --> 2326.08]  and we're going to be realistic.
[2326.08 --> 2326.90]  Like it was,
[2326.96 --> 2327.42]  I don't know.
[2327.50 --> 2327.62]  I,
[2327.72 --> 2328.14]  it was,
[2328.14 --> 2329.40]  it's tough seeing people say,
[2329.48 --> 2330.44]  yeah,
[2330.44 --> 2331.60]  it's easy for a,
[2331.68 --> 2331.98]  you know,
[2332.42 --> 2336.98]  it's easy for someone like you to come down and millionaire explain to us
[2336.98 --> 2338.32]  why it costs so much,
[2338.32 --> 2339.84]  but you're just out of touch.
[2340.06 --> 2340.80]  And it's like,
[2340.88 --> 2341.08]  well,
[2341.18 --> 2342.20]  okay.
[2342.20 --> 2343.72]  But if someone else said it,
[2343.72 --> 2344.38]  would it be,
[2344.76 --> 2346.16]  would it be more true?
[2346.26 --> 2347.70]  The information doesn't change or less true?
[2347.70 --> 2352.48]  Because what it really boils down to is that there's about 200,
[2352.62 --> 2355.82]  250 bucks worth of GPU and SSD upgrade in this thing.
[2356.14 --> 2357.50]  Stop millionaires playing to me.
[2357.50 --> 2359.46]  And it costs about 200,
[2359.70 --> 2360.82]  250 bucks more,
[2360.92 --> 2362.52]  kind of depending on how you want to do the math.
[2362.98 --> 2363.18]  Yeah.
[2363.36 --> 2363.90]  And it's like,
[2364.44 --> 2366.58]  they're going to make money off it because they have no competition.
[2367.00 --> 2369.40]  So that's what companies do.
[2369.48 --> 2370.14]  And it's like,
[2370.18 --> 2370.56]  uh,
[2370.82 --> 2371.18]  and,
[2371.24 --> 2371.64]  and we're not,
[2371.70 --> 2372.04]  I'm not,
[2372.12 --> 2373.16]  I'm not being an apologist.
[2373.16 --> 2373.98]  I'm not saying,
[2374.16 --> 2375.16]  I'm not saying it's good.
[2375.48 --> 2376.74]  I'm just saying it is.
[2377.84 --> 2378.22]  Um,
[2378.64 --> 2380.94]  sorry.
[2382.00 --> 2382.40]  Yeah.
[2383.40 --> 2383.88]  Um,
[2383.96 --> 2384.32]  the,
[2384.44 --> 2385.58]  the whole iPhone thing,
[2385.62 --> 2388.80]  a comment that I saw a few times after we moved off the topic was that,
[2389.36 --> 2389.80]  uh,
[2389.80 --> 2394.50]  we were ignoring negatives in the video that you did for the iPhone thing.
[2394.62 --> 2395.02]  Yeah.
[2395.22 --> 2396.78]  Did you mention anything about how,
[2396.90 --> 2397.08]  like,
[2397.16 --> 2397.42]  you know,
[2397.42 --> 2397.82]  it's cool,
[2397.90 --> 2398.12]  whatever,
[2398.12 --> 2401.20]  but it might not make sense for you to upgrade if you're on 15.
[2402.20 --> 2403.74]  I just thought that was obvious.
[2403.98 --> 2404.42]  Okay.
[2404.76 --> 2405.34]  I did not,
[2405.46 --> 2408.98]  I did not mention that it might not make sense to upgrade from the 15.
[2409.64 --> 2410.88]  That wasn't my perspective.
[2411.42 --> 2411.90]  Um,
[2412.06 --> 2417.72]  and I think this comes back to a point that you've kind of been hammering on for a while.
[2418.62 --> 2421.94]  We don't need everyone to have that perspective.
[2422.18 --> 2422.26]  Yeah,
[2422.26 --> 2422.68]  for sure.
[2422.82 --> 2424.48]  If you want that perspective,
[2424.48 --> 2429.28]  you should be watching a video from someone who has an iPhone 15.
[2429.46 --> 2430.30]  I don't.
[2430.30 --> 2432.08]  If you are seriously considering this thing,
[2432.12 --> 2433.00]  I would watch,
[2433.18 --> 2434.16]  I,
[2434.22 --> 2435.62]  I would value personally,
[2435.62 --> 2438.50]  like actually completely detaching myself as much as possible.
[2439.12 --> 2439.60]  Um,
[2439.74 --> 2443.56]  I would value seeing your video because it's a different take.
[2443.86 --> 2447.40]  And then I would watch a range of other videos that also have other takes.
[2447.40 --> 2453.32]  And then I would find where my opinion is on it somewhere in the middle or whatever.
[2453.78 --> 2454.26]  Um,
[2454.30 --> 2456.24]  maybe I align perfectly with someone who knows,
[2456.30 --> 2457.24]  but like you,
[2457.30 --> 2457.44]  you,
[2457.52 --> 2458.74]  you figure out where it is,
[2458.74 --> 2459.86]  but I,
[2459.86 --> 2465.62]  I don't personally even want a reality where every single piece of content on a product is exactly the same.
[2465.86 --> 2467.06]  Because if that happens,
[2467.06 --> 2469.56]  there will only be one reviewer left.
[2469.82 --> 2470.26]  Yeah.
[2470.38 --> 2470.54]  And,
[2470.64 --> 2471.18]  and there's no,
[2471.44 --> 2473.46]  eventually people will stop watching all the other ones.
[2473.58 --> 2474.82]  There's no value to it.
[2474.82 --> 2475.04]  I mean,
[2475.04 --> 2476.56]  this is a funny thing.
[2476.70 --> 2477.02]  Um,
[2477.02 --> 2481.70]  I often get asked by up and comers or people who want to start a tech channel,
[2481.70 --> 2482.42]  you know,
[2482.42 --> 2482.72]  like,
[2482.82 --> 2484.92]  do you have any advice on,
[2484.98 --> 2485.52]  on like,
[2485.58 --> 2485.86]  you know,
[2485.86 --> 2486.54]  my style?
[2486.54 --> 2486.76]  Like,
[2486.78 --> 2488.60]  what can I do to make my videos more like you?
[2488.60 --> 2489.16]  And I'm like,
[2489.24 --> 2490.88]  you don't,
[2491.00 --> 2493.32]  you should have your own ideas.
[2493.32 --> 2494.74]  You should have your own perspective.
[2495.18 --> 2500.36]  However much the audience is going to yell at you for not exactly copying what everyone else does.
[2500.52 --> 2501.30]  In the long term,
[2501.40 --> 2501.84]  it's better.
[2501.84 --> 2503.02]  They'll value it.
[2503.14 --> 2503.34]  And,
[2503.46 --> 2504.62]  and the proof is in the pudding.
[2504.88 --> 2505.68]  My perspectives,
[2505.90 --> 2507.92]  my takes have changed over the years.
[2508.22 --> 2510.10]  And that's not flip-flopping.
[2510.32 --> 2514.14]  That's being open to new information and new ideas and new perspectives.
[2514.74 --> 2515.12]  Theoretically,
[2515.12 --> 2517.58]  if you follow the scientific method,
[2517.72 --> 2518.00]  your,
[2518.00 --> 2521.28]  your stances on things should change with new information.
[2522.18 --> 2524.74]  You should be trying to have the most accurate one you can.
[2524.84 --> 2525.06]  And I,
[2525.06 --> 2526.90]  I did mention some negative things.
[2527.06 --> 2528.70]  Like I mentioned that,
[2528.70 --> 2529.16]  uh,
[2529.16 --> 2531.72]  you can get cheap Android phones that have higher,
[2531.84 --> 2532.66]  fresh rate displays.
[2532.94 --> 2535.50]  When I talked about the 60 Hertz display on the non pro,
[2535.70 --> 2541.08]  I mentioned that I would miss side loading and that I would probably still need to have an Android device handy.
[2541.62 --> 2544.08]  Like I did acknowledge issues.
[2544.40 --> 2546.20]  It's not like I'm just trying to,
[2546.34 --> 2547.60]  yeah,
[2547.64 --> 2551.58]  it's not like I'm just trying to like be an Apple apologist.
[2551.58 --> 2552.32]  All of a sudden,
[2552.32 --> 2554.92]  I'm never going to get an invite to one of their events.
[2554.92 --> 2556.24]  That's never going to happen.
[2556.24 --> 2556.74]  And like,
[2556.74 --> 2557.16]  honestly,
[2557.16 --> 2559.04]  it really just doesn't matter anymore.
[2559.18 --> 2560.52]  I don't know if you want to go.
[2560.52 --> 2566.78]  It would be so much more work to make the same video that I would make in my basement.
[2566.98 --> 2567.08]  Yeah.
[2567.08 --> 2568.48]  Cause you're just watching the keynote anyways.
[2569.12 --> 2569.52]  Yeah.
[2569.72 --> 2570.14]  So like,
[2570.20 --> 2570.64]  so like,
[2570.68 --> 2571.32]  why am I there?
[2571.48 --> 2571.74]  Yeah.
[2571.98 --> 2572.40]  I don't know.
[2572.58 --> 2573.12]  Like I can,
[2573.28 --> 2574.74]  I can get hands on with it,
[2574.74 --> 2576.64]  but let's be real.
[2576.68 --> 2577.22]  It's an iPhone.
[2577.22 --> 2578.28]  Like,
[2578.28 --> 2578.30]  like,
[2578.84 --> 2579.36]  that's,
[2579.36 --> 2580.36]  that's,
[2580.36 --> 2586.48]  all right.
[2587.10 --> 2587.46]  Okay.
[2587.60 --> 2588.20]  I think we've,
[2588.26 --> 2590.68]  we've bashed the things that you were wrong about.
[2590.94 --> 2591.34]  Um,
[2591.46 --> 2591.72]  yeah.
[2592.14 --> 2592.74]  Moving on.
[2593.48 --> 2594.44]  Should we do this one?
[2594.50 --> 2595.84]  I'm still wondering what this one is.
[2597.60 --> 2597.96]  Oh,
[2598.26 --> 2598.54]  oh,
[2598.60 --> 2598.78]  sure.
[2598.88 --> 2599.06]  Yeah.
[2599.06 --> 2600.28]  We could do a couple of merch messages.
[2600.82 --> 2601.14]  Sure.
[2601.14 --> 2601.34]  I mean,
[2601.34 --> 2602.66]  that was kind of like two topics,
[2602.72 --> 2602.88]  right?
[2603.08 --> 2603.32]  Yeah.
[2603.32 --> 2604.50]  I think that was two topics.
[2605.62 --> 2607.56]  If you guys want to interact with the show,
[2607.98 --> 2608.20]  you know,
[2608.26 --> 2613.64]  send a little message to producer Dan so he can put it at the bottom of the screen or send you a little response or forward it internally.
[2613.88 --> 2615.58]  The way to do it is a merch message.
[2615.68 --> 2618.54]  We don't want you wasting your money just throwing it at the screen.
[2618.68 --> 2619.10]  If you,
[2619.24 --> 2620.62]  if you want to throw money at the screen,
[2620.74 --> 2623.96]  you should get high quality merchandise in the mail for your efforts.
[2623.96 --> 2628.26]  And we've got a deal for you this week.
[2628.90 --> 2632.92]  We are heating things up with a special promo for WAN Show.
[2633.32 --> 2634.86]  We're bringing back Luke.
[2635.04 --> 2635.78]  You got to get your thing.
[2636.20 --> 2636.36]  Oh,
[2636.48 --> 2637.04]  they don't fit.
[2637.64 --> 2637.92]  Oh,
[2638.08 --> 2638.72]  they didn't have my size.
[2638.86 --> 2639.56]  Did they bring the wrong size?
[2639.74 --> 2639.92]  Yeah,
[2640.04 --> 2642.02]  but I have other colors to show you.
[2642.44 --> 2642.76]  All right,
[2642.82 --> 2643.04]  cool.
[2644.06 --> 2647.34]  We're bringing back some pieces for a limited time.
[2647.34 --> 2648.88]  Now that it's almost fall.
[2649.22 --> 2654.90]  These are the color block hoodies that we released a couple of years back themed around our various channels.
[2654.90 --> 2656.40]  So I'm wearing the short circuit one.
[2656.50 --> 2656.98]  Here's LTT.
[2657.20 --> 2658.16]  Here's the tech quickie one.
[2658.58 --> 2663.04]  We thought it'd be fun to throw these back up on the site for just,
[2663.32 --> 2664.60]  $39.99.
[2665.16 --> 2668.08]  But the catch is that they're only available as a mystery.
[2668.36 --> 2670.70]  So you never know which one you're going to get.
[2671.50 --> 2673.42]  And we're going to heat things up even more.
[2675.12 --> 2676.82]  Coming back at the same time,
[2677.58 --> 2678.58]  WAN sweatpants.
[2678.84 --> 2680.84]  And if you buy a mystery color block hoodie,
[2680.98 --> 2682.12]  you'll get these for 10 bucks.
[2682.90 --> 2683.74]  Which is nuts.
[2684.32 --> 2684.88]  Heads up.
[2685.14 --> 2687.54]  This is kind of for our big boys out there.
[2687.54 --> 2687.84]  Okay.
[2687.94 --> 2690.92]  We have very limited stock of the smaller sizes.
[2691.06 --> 2694.22]  We're stocked a little bit deeper on the bigger sizes.
[2694.64 --> 2701.92]  But the discount will apply automatically when you have both a mystery color block hoodie and a pair of WAN sweatpants in your cart.
[2701.92 --> 2706.64]  So if you're looking to send a merch message while being able to get some stuff that's on sale that won't be available for much longer,
[2707.12 --> 2708.08]  now is your chance.
[2708.50 --> 2709.32]  Also on the store,
[2709.40 --> 2711.64]  the off-site laptop bag is available again.
[2712.36 --> 2713.20]  To be clear,
[2713.44 --> 2713.72]  guys,
[2714.72 --> 2717.70]  it is not going to fit an Ohio class submarine in it.
[2717.92 --> 2719.54]  It is a laptop bag.
[2719.76 --> 2720.90]  It is not a,
[2721.70 --> 2722.54]  what are they called?
[2722.98 --> 2723.34]  The like...
[2723.34 --> 2723.88]  Messenger bags?
[2724.04 --> 2724.14]  Yeah,
[2724.18 --> 2725.40]  it's not a messenger bag.
[2725.52 --> 2726.92]  This is a laptop bag.
[2727.66 --> 2728.06]  So,
[2728.24 --> 2730.12]  sorry for any miscommunication around that.
[2730.38 --> 2732.06]  LMG.GG slash laptop bag.
[2732.14 --> 2732.66]  It's up there.
[2733.30 --> 2735.88]  And I guess that's all we have to say about merch messages.
[2736.00 --> 2737.80]  So all you got to do is add something to your cart.
[2737.88 --> 2739.20]  You'll see a little box for a merch message.
[2739.28 --> 2740.20]  That'll go to producer Dan.
[2740.56 --> 2741.36]  Let's show you how it works.
[2741.44 --> 2741.58]  Dan,
[2741.62 --> 2742.50]  hit me with a merch message.
[2742.70 --> 2743.10]  Sure thing.
[2743.10 --> 2743.50]  Hey,
[2743.72 --> 2748.60]  LiDAR Nuke and Dual and PVS 14 night vision monocular.
[2748.76 --> 2748.94]  Sure.
[2749.36 --> 2749.66]  Sure.
[2750.16 --> 2750.78]  I know that thing.
[2750.94 --> 2751.20]  Yeah,
[2751.26 --> 2751.56]  cool.
[2751.86 --> 2753.86]  If given the choice and that it was,
[2753.88 --> 2754.78]  was unproblematic,
[2754.90 --> 2757.14]  would you choose to cover older military tech?
[2757.28 --> 2757.74]  If not,
[2757.88 --> 2758.50]  if so,
[2758.62 --> 2759.52]  under what circumstances?
[2761.56 --> 2762.64]  Older military tech.
[2762.66 --> 2762.80]  Yeah,
[2762.86 --> 2765.86]  I don't see why we wouldn't cover a military tech thing.
[2766.14 --> 2770.96]  The issue for me is that we don't really get into tech history that much.
[2771.02 --> 2771.24]  Yeah.
[2772.32 --> 2775.48]  And we definitely don't,
[2775.62 --> 2775.82]  I think,
[2775.84 --> 2780.94]  have the street cred in the military space to speak intelligently about that kind of thing.
[2781.00 --> 2781.12]  Like,
[2781.16 --> 2783.08]  I would be doing all the same research that,
[2783.08 --> 2785.90]  anyone else would do,
[2786.04 --> 2786.40]  you know,
[2786.78 --> 2789.36]  browsing forums and Wikipedia and,
[2789.36 --> 2790.34]  you know,
[2790.50 --> 2793.28]  downloading schematics off of War Thunder or,
[2794.28 --> 2796.16]  that are not supposed to be there or whatever.
[2796.48 --> 2797.54]  Leaking military secrets.
[2797.68 --> 2797.78]  Yeah.
[2797.78 --> 2799.56]  Given the reference in the,
[2799.56 --> 2800.26]  in the naming,
[2800.48 --> 2801.02]  uh,
[2801.02 --> 2802.66]  covering like night vision goggles,
[2802.78 --> 2805.04]  I don't think is a thing that makes a ton of sense for us.
[2805.12 --> 2806.96]  I think it would have to be like,
[2807.66 --> 2808.48]  how do they,
[2808.80 --> 2809.60]  uh,
[2809.60 --> 2811.36]  how do they make sure that like,
[2811.66 --> 2812.18]  I don't know,
[2812.46 --> 2817.48]  these electronical components are able to survive in like,
[2817.54 --> 2818.20]  uh,
[2818.20 --> 2819.14]  warfare zones.
[2819.14 --> 2820.86]  I could see that being like a good tech quickie.
[2820.96 --> 2821.10]  Yeah.
[2821.22 --> 2821.46]  You know,
[2821.46 --> 2824.54]  what makes an electronic device battle ready,
[2824.78 --> 2824.92]  you know,
[2824.92 --> 2825.74]  or something like that.
[2825.80 --> 2826.14]  But how does it,
[2826.14 --> 2828.14]  how does it help resist EMP pulses,
[2828.44 --> 2829.04]  stuff like that?
[2829.16 --> 2829.38]  Yeah.
[2829.38 --> 2830.00]  I don't see,
[2830.10 --> 2831.06]  I don't see really the,
[2831.16 --> 2833.28]  why we would get into like a specific piece.
[2833.28 --> 2835.94]  So like that really seems more like a,
[2835.94 --> 2837.48]  like a gun channel could,
[2838.54 --> 2838.76]  I,
[2838.86 --> 2839.22]  I,
[2839.22 --> 2839.24]  I,
[2839.34 --> 2839.50]  okay.
[2839.62 --> 2843.16]  I could see us being brought in as a collaborator on something like that.
[2843.20 --> 2844.08]  Like if they,
[2844.20 --> 2845.64]  if they wanted to discuss,
[2845.94 --> 2846.40]  um,
[2846.94 --> 2847.26]  if they,
[2847.30 --> 2847.58]  you know,
[2847.58 --> 2849.54]  pull the board out of something and they were like,
[2849.56 --> 2849.90]  okay.
[2850.36 --> 2850.84]  Uh,
[2850.84 --> 2851.88]  and then to talk about,
[2851.98 --> 2852.14]  you know,
[2852.14 --> 2855.42]  what makes this board special compared to consumer electronics at the time,
[2855.52 --> 2856.10]  uh,
[2856.10 --> 2858.14]  we sent it to LTT to,
[2858.36 --> 2858.94]  or sure.
[2859.20 --> 2859.86]  Or the opposite,
[2860.04 --> 2860.86]  considering they had that,
[2860.96 --> 2861.06]  like,
[2861.10 --> 2862.16]  was it PlayStation threes?
[2862.24 --> 2862.68]  I think it was that,
[2862.72 --> 2863.26]  that server,
[2863.28 --> 2864.54]  farm made out of playstations.
[2864.54 --> 2864.82]  Like,
[2864.86 --> 2866.04]  like little things like that.
[2866.18 --> 2866.42]  Yeah.
[2866.50 --> 2867.12]  Could make sense.
[2867.22 --> 2868.14]  But I think,
[2868.20 --> 2868.60]  um,
[2869.86 --> 2872.12]  there isn't as much crossover as you might think,
[2872.74 --> 2873.26]  but there's,
[2873.34 --> 2876.40]  there's some next up.
[2876.40 --> 2877.00]  Sure thing.
[2877.42 --> 2877.56]  Hi,
[2877.66 --> 2878.10]  LLD.
[2878.38 --> 2880.10]  You've teased a smaller backpack before.
[2880.22 --> 2883.00]  Is that still in the works or was it replaced by the,
[2883.00 --> 2884.82]  I don't know.
[2885.28 --> 2885.92]  Laptop bag.
[2886.08 --> 2887.00]  Does it just cut off there?
[2887.08 --> 2887.36]  By the.
[2887.96 --> 2888.30]  Okay.
[2888.42 --> 2888.86]  By the,
[2889.06 --> 2889.56]  um,
[2890.14 --> 2892.20]  it is definitely still in the works.
[2892.66 --> 2894.92]  Our latest sample of it is very good.
[2895.42 --> 2895.62]  Uh,
[2895.62 --> 2895.80]  Luke,
[2895.84 --> 2896.48]  you saw it last week.
[2896.72 --> 2896.96]  Yeah.
[2897.24 --> 2897.50]  Yeah.
[2897.66 --> 2899.74]  I really liked the side pockets.
[2899.92 --> 2900.92]  I won't say too much about it.
[2901.14 --> 2901.36]  Yeah.
[2901.54 --> 2902.60]  I don't know how much we're talking about,
[2902.68 --> 2903.38]  but those are sweet.
[2903.54 --> 2905.82]  Did I even show you the little hidden pockets that are in them?
[2906.80 --> 2907.48]  I don't think so.
[2907.56 --> 2909.20]  I don't know if those are going to make it into the final,
[2909.30 --> 2909.88]  but we're going to,
[2909.94 --> 2910.92]  we're going to push for it.
[2910.98 --> 2911.30]  Um,
[2911.70 --> 2912.30]  depends on,
[2912.38 --> 2913.48]  depends on costing a little bit,
[2913.56 --> 2914.00]  but yeah,
[2914.04 --> 2914.20]  no,
[2914.26 --> 2914.42]  the,
[2914.42 --> 2915.84]  the smaller backpack is coming.
[2916.20 --> 2916.42]  Uh,
[2916.42 --> 2917.82]  we're working on naming for it.
[2917.90 --> 2920.14]  I think we're going to have to do one more sample,
[2920.28 --> 2924.76]  but hopefully that'll be like a pre-production sample rather than a sample sample.
[2924.76 --> 2926.82]  And if we can sign off on that one,
[2927.20 --> 2928.34]  it can go to production.
[2928.52 --> 2928.76]  Uh,
[2928.76 --> 2928.94]  we're,
[2929.04 --> 2929.56]  we're very,
[2929.72 --> 2932.00]  very excited about it right now.
[2932.00 --> 2935.34]  It fits like a 15.6 inch gaming laptop pretty comfortably.
[2935.82 --> 2941.04]  We think we can make a tweak that would allow it to fit most 16 inch devices,
[2941.04 --> 2942.20]  even at that size.
[2942.74 --> 2943.18]  Um,
[2943.52 --> 2946.10]  it's the one that I was wearing in my AMD,
[2946.10 --> 2946.82]  um,
[2947.88 --> 2948.42]  Ryzen,
[2949.38 --> 2949.80]  uh,
[2949.80 --> 2952.62]  Ryzen 9,000 coverage from Computex.
[2953.08 --> 2954.46]  If I recall correctly.
[2954.76 --> 2957.00]  So it looks a little bit different.
[2957.48 --> 2958.54]  Computex line is,
[2958.54 --> 2958.92]  uh,
[2958.92 --> 2959.24]  2024.
[2959.54 --> 2960.88]  It looks a bit different now.
[2960.88 --> 2963.94]  And the internal layout thankfully is way better.
[2964.12 --> 2968.68]  It was my notes after that trip were not good.
[2968.68 --> 2971.38]  And I wasn't a hundred percent sure if we were gonna,
[2971.38 --> 2979.14]  if we were gonna even be able to move forward with the product because the design of it was so dependent on,
[2979.14 --> 2980.38]  um,
[2980.38 --> 2981.30]  um,
[2981.30 --> 2981.36]  um,
[2982.98 --> 2985.48]  it being basically unusable as far as I could tell.
[2985.70 --> 2986.66]  But Matthew,
[2986.66 --> 2993.64]  I think is the one who did the work on tweaking the design while also dramatically improving the usability of it.
[2993.74 --> 2994.10]  Uh,
[2994.10 --> 2994.26]  yeah,
[2994.30 --> 2994.92]  here's the,
[2995.04 --> 2997.64]  here's the video where I think it made its first appearance.
[2997.64 --> 2998.32]  Uh,
[2998.32 --> 2998.94]  this is a,
[2999.04 --> 2999.76]  this is apparently,
[3000.36 --> 3000.62]  uh,
[3000.98 --> 3002.62]  but this is apparently a hack.
[3002.74 --> 3004.30]  If you just go back and forward,
[3004.30 --> 3005.92]  ads disappear.
[3006.20 --> 3007.70]  And the more you do that,
[3007.70 --> 3010.78]  the more it trains YouTube to just not bother serving you ads.
[3011.00 --> 3011.30]  Really?
[3011.58 --> 3011.80]  Yeah.
[3011.80 --> 3013.66]  It doesn't seem to account for that.
[3013.74 --> 3015.18]  You go right back onto the video.
[3015.18 --> 3016.48]  Here's just accounts for that.
[3016.54 --> 3017.46]  You bounce off the video.
[3017.52 --> 3018.44]  The second you see an ad,
[3018.56 --> 3019.26]  here's a question.
[3019.48 --> 3019.68]  Yeah.
[3020.42 --> 3021.64]  If ad block is piracy.
[3021.88 --> 3022.28]  Yes.
[3022.36 --> 3024.18]  Is ad aversion piracy?
[3025.50 --> 3026.68]  Like avoiding ads.
[3027.16 --> 3027.58]  Oh,
[3027.64 --> 3027.88]  like,
[3027.96 --> 3028.96]  like ad avoidance,
[3029.08 --> 3031.64]  like going back and forward to make it not send it.
[3031.76 --> 3032.42]  Resume viewing,
[3032.70 --> 3033.50]  resume viewing,
[3034.22 --> 3035.02]  that kind of thing.
[3035.18 --> 3035.52]  Hmm.
[3035.66 --> 3035.98]  Yeah.
[3036.22 --> 3036.54]  Yeah.
[3036.88 --> 3037.32]  Creepy.
[3037.32 --> 3039.60]  I think as long as you are,
[3039.88 --> 3042.08]  cause you're not breaking terms of service.
[3042.08 --> 3046.04]  It's not against the terms of service to close your eyes.
[3046.04 --> 3048.74]  Is it officially against the terms of service to use ad block?
[3049.16 --> 3049.44]  Yeah.
[3049.80 --> 3050.12]  Okay.
[3051.58 --> 3057.32]  Whereas navigating away from a page is absolutely not against the terms of service.
[3057.44 --> 3057.56]  No.
[3058.10 --> 3059.94]  But if you automated it,
[3060.04 --> 3064.80]  so if you had a browser extension that every time you clicked a YouTube video,
[3065.06 --> 3068.42]  like micro loaded the page and unloaded it and then loaded it again,
[3068.42 --> 3070.78]  I think that would qualify as a,
[3070.78 --> 3071.36]  as a,
[3071.36 --> 3072.90]  as an ad serving countermeasure.
[3073.20 --> 3073.88]  Cause it's,
[3073.88 --> 3075.12]  it's the automation of it.
[3075.24 --> 3075.62]  Like that.
[3075.84 --> 3076.88]  But not manually running it.
[3077.00 --> 3077.82]  That whole,
[3078.00 --> 3085.36]  that whole argument where ad block is basically the same as closing your eyes is stupid.
[3086.16 --> 3086.64]  Yeah.
[3086.70 --> 3088.14]  Because it's not.
[3088.32 --> 3088.56]  Yeah.
[3088.80 --> 3091.00]  Closing your eyes is the same as closing your eyes.
[3091.06 --> 3091.56]  And you know,
[3091.58 --> 3093.88]  they'll compare it to like TV commercials or whatever else.
[3093.88 --> 3094.12]  Right.
[3094.12 --> 3095.12]  Um,
[3095.90 --> 3096.14]  no,
[3096.20 --> 3096.84]  because you,
[3097.16 --> 3097.50]  you,
[3097.54 --> 3097.84]  you would,
[3097.96 --> 3099.46]  you would just close your eyes.
[3099.52 --> 3099.68]  That,
[3099.84 --> 3100.92]  that would be the same thing.
[3101.38 --> 3101.82]  Um,
[3101.82 --> 3102.28]  but when you,
[3102.36 --> 3103.34]  when you automate something,
[3103.66 --> 3104.14]  um,
[3104.16 --> 3107.00]  then to me that becomes a,
[3107.00 --> 3108.94]  um,
[3109.06 --> 3111.66]  is it also the distribution of it of said thing?
[3114.06 --> 3114.50]  Hmm.
[3116.40 --> 3120.26]  So you're talking like if you made your own script or something like that,
[3120.26 --> 3121.36]  or you made your own tool.
[3121.50 --> 3122.60]  I want to address this really quick.
[3122.60 --> 3122.86]  Yeah.
[3122.86 --> 3124.08]  Cyndrax in flow plane chat said,
[3124.24 --> 3125.66]  I just hate malvertising.
[3126.22 --> 3127.72]  I strongly agree.
[3127.86 --> 3129.12]  I hate malvertising too.
[3129.60 --> 3130.00]  Um,
[3130.02 --> 3130.50]  so that's it.
[3130.56 --> 3133.02]  We're not telling you don't run this.
[3133.10 --> 3135.08]  We're also not telling you don't use ad block.
[3135.20 --> 3135.50]  Yeah.
[3136.24 --> 3138.44]  Literally never happened.
[3138.60 --> 3139.24]  Never said that.
[3139.50 --> 3139.74]  Yeah.
[3139.78 --> 3140.18]  It's,
[3140.18 --> 3141.44]  I,
[3141.54 --> 3141.84]  uh,
[3142.16 --> 3142.70]  yeah,
[3143.16 --> 3143.36]  I,
[3143.40 --> 3143.96]  I don't have,
[3143.96 --> 3144.92]  I don't feel like,
[3145.00 --> 3146.70]  I don't feel like rehashing that one today.
[3146.70 --> 3147.06]  Sure.
[3147.60 --> 3148.00]  Um,
[3148.28 --> 3149.42]  I have never said,
[3149.62 --> 3150.32]  don't use ad block.
[3150.32 --> 3155.90]  I'm trying to think like maybe there was some WAN show in the garage in 2013 where somebody's
[3155.90 --> 3156.30]  going to like,
[3156.46 --> 3156.98]  got them.
[3157.20 --> 3157.70]  It's like,
[3157.76 --> 3158.72]  I don't know.
[3158.84 --> 3159.10]  Whatever.
[3160.10 --> 3160.46]  Okay.
[3160.74 --> 3161.72]  I have never,
[3161.72 --> 3164.26]  that I recall said,
[3164.36 --> 3165.44]  don't use ad block.
[3165.92 --> 3166.36]  Um,
[3166.36 --> 3169.66]  I've been very consistent for a lot of years that,
[3169.66 --> 3170.06]  uh,
[3170.06 --> 3170.48]  I don't know.
[3170.58 --> 3171.04]  Val here,
[3171.04 --> 3172.20]  Rick in flow plane chat said,
[3172.26 --> 3174.82]  Linus literally called me up last night and told me not to use that box.
[3174.94 --> 3175.88]  So what are you saying?
[3176.40 --> 3180.10]  I told you not to tell people that that was a,
[3180.22 --> 3182.90]  that was a conversation between just the two of us.
[3183.44 --> 3184.50]  He called me too.
[3184.50 --> 3186.66]  So is that,
[3186.86 --> 3188.02]  is that why you're so tired this week?
[3188.92 --> 3190.92]  You're just calling all of the audience members.
[3191.14 --> 3192.76]  I actually have to confess something.
[3192.80 --> 3194.68]  You broke into the flow plane database.
[3194.80 --> 3195.74]  I have to confess something.
[3197.04 --> 3198.26]  I bought an auto dialer.
[3198.48 --> 3199.44]  It wasn't even me.
[3200.50 --> 3201.04]  It was,
[3201.16 --> 3202.50]  it was a recording.
[3203.02 --> 3203.42]  Oh,
[3203.52 --> 3206.52]  so they couldn't even tell it wasn't me because those guys are idiots.
[3206.52 --> 3206.92]  It's not even,
[3206.92 --> 3207.26]  Oh,
[3207.80 --> 3209.36]  it's not even AI on your voice.
[3209.50 --> 3209.72]  Nope.
[3209.94 --> 3210.22]  Nope.
[3210.32 --> 3212.14]  It's literally an old fashioned auto dialer.
[3212.14 --> 3213.90]  They got bam boozled.
[3214.08 --> 3214.44]  Wow.
[3214.78 --> 3215.04]  Yep.
[3215.50 --> 3215.80]  Wow.
[3216.84 --> 3217.88]  Get wrecked.
[3218.86 --> 3219.38]  Um,
[3219.78 --> 3220.44]  anyways.
[3220.54 --> 3220.70]  Yeah.
[3220.72 --> 3221.48]  It's not a thing,
[3221.56 --> 3221.70]  dude.
[3221.76 --> 3222.22]  We're just,
[3222.36 --> 3222.76]  uh,
[3224.10 --> 3226.02]  and like we've got,
[3226.18 --> 3226.40]  we,
[3226.48 --> 3228.02]  we both got some Linux ISOs.
[3228.02 --> 3228.26]  Okay.
[3228.60 --> 3229.58]  So like relax.
[3229.98 --> 3230.26]  Yep.
[3230.70 --> 3231.72]  Or don't relax.
[3231.72 --> 3233.50]  It actually doesn't really matter to me.
[3235.24 --> 3236.08]  Stay tense.
[3236.32 --> 3236.66]  Um,
[3237.24 --> 3240.70]  I'm probably going to do one more if you're okay with that.
[3240.70 --> 3241.12]  Sure.
[3241.32 --> 3241.76]  Sure.
[3241.76 --> 3242.50]  Let's see.
[3243.08 --> 3243.20]  Hey,
[3243.30 --> 3243.70]  LLD.
[3243.88 --> 3245.82]  Did Plex ever fix your issues?
[3246.04 --> 3248.04]  Got my first NAS set up a bit ago.
[3248.24 --> 3250.20]  Transcoded downloads are crucial for me.
[3250.26 --> 3251.82]  So decided to try MB.
[3252.22 --> 3253.58]  Haven't had any real issues.
[3253.66 --> 3254.34]  Might be worth a look.
[3255.80 --> 3261.10]  I am probably going to try jellyfin or MB at some point.
[3261.56 --> 3262.00]  Um,
[3262.10 --> 3264.22]  overall I've been,
[3264.38 --> 3267.78]  I've been pretty annoyed with Plex.
[3268.38 --> 3268.78]  Um,
[3269.28 --> 3275.92]  that issue recently was a permissions thing in true NAS where I was having trouble with that show you wanted to watch.
[3275.92 --> 3277.38]  So that wasn't a Plex issue.
[3277.52 --> 3278.96]  That series of Linux ISOs.
[3278.98 --> 3279.14]  Yeah.
[3279.14 --> 3280.32]  Series of Linux ISOs.
[3280.32 --> 3280.48]  Sure.
[3280.56 --> 3280.72]  Whatever.
[3280.86 --> 3281.00]  Yeah.
[3281.00 --> 3281.10]  Yeah.
[3281.10 --> 3281.30]  Yeah.
[3281.30 --> 3281.70]  Um,
[3281.90 --> 3284.70]  the point is just that I haven't,
[3284.76 --> 3287.26]  I haven't actually tried to do a lot of local,
[3287.26 --> 3287.96]  uh,
[3287.96 --> 3289.12]  local downloads lately.
[3289.12 --> 3289.86]  So I haven't,
[3289.90 --> 3292.00]  I haven't realistically played with it that much,
[3292.00 --> 3295.38]  but Plex has been pretty well behaved for me lately.
[3295.38 --> 3297.26]  And I actually saw some pretty promising news.
[3297.34 --> 3298.80]  I think it was either this morning or yesterday.
[3299.22 --> 3306.34]  Plex announced that they are going to split out the photo backup functionality that they used to have in the main Plex app into a separate app.
[3306.34 --> 3313.74]  And I remember talking to them about that because the photo backup function was really cool and really easy to use and really convenient.
[3313.74 --> 3314.80]  And I really liked it.
[3314.84 --> 3316.80]  And then they just deprecated it.
[3316.82 --> 3317.20]  And I was like,
[3317.22 --> 3317.30]  well,
[3317.30 --> 3322.84]  that's sort of uncool because I thought that that was part of the function of this product.
[3322.84 --> 3324.28]  So now it's a separate app.
[3324.28 --> 3327.54]  And I wonder if that's going to help them overcome some of the challenges that they've had,
[3327.54 --> 3330.30]  because from what I gleaned,
[3330.30 --> 3339.24]  the issues that they had continuing to support that feature basically came down to like library access and like constant changes when it came to,
[3339.24 --> 3340.56]  um,
[3341.60 --> 3344.12]  accessing the library and then backing it up,
[3344.12 --> 3345.88]  especially as a background task.
[3346.16 --> 3349.96]  So if that can be a dedicated app rather than part of the video watching app,
[3350.04 --> 3351.50]  maybe that'll help them do a better job of it.
[3351.54 --> 3352.46]  So I want to check that out,
[3352.46 --> 3355.74]  but I know absolutely nothing about it yet.
[3356.28 --> 3357.58]  And I'm going to have to,
[3358.12 --> 3358.84]  I'll give it a chance.
[3359.00 --> 3359.22]  I mean,
[3359.22 --> 3359.34]  I,
[3359.44 --> 3361.28]  I have a lifetime subscription.
[3362.20 --> 3363.52]  So if I,
[3363.88 --> 3365.04]  so if you go away from it,
[3365.06 --> 3365.88]  you can always just come back.
[3365.94 --> 3366.06]  Yeah.
[3366.06 --> 3366.34]  And look,
[3366.34 --> 3368.74]  but the cost of Plex is not a factor for me.
[3368.74 --> 3369.06]  Yeah.
[3369.18 --> 3369.28]  For,
[3369.38 --> 3370.08]  for a lot of people,
[3370.14 --> 3371.78]  the cost of Plex is a major factor.
[3371.78 --> 3373.44]  So they want something free and open source,
[3373.44 --> 3373.90]  but I,
[3373.94 --> 3375.66]  I don't care because I already own it.
[3375.70 --> 3375.94]  So the,
[3375.94 --> 3378.02]  the cost of both of them is the same for me personally.
[3378.46 --> 3378.78]  Uh,
[3378.78 --> 3381.00]  it might change what I would recommend to someone else.
[3381.00 --> 3381.44]  I might say,
[3381.50 --> 3381.70]  Hey,
[3381.70 --> 3384.72]  give these free options a try before you spring for the paid one.
[3384.92 --> 3385.54]  But for me,
[3385.56 --> 3386.08]  it doesn't matter.
[3386.08 --> 3387.56]  So I'm going to give it a shot.
[3387.60 --> 3390.94]  And then the other big thing that I'm waiting for is,
[3390.94 --> 3391.64]  um,
[3391.82 --> 3392.10]  that,
[3392.22 --> 3394.42]  that NAS software that I invested in from,
[3394.42 --> 3394.96]  from hashtag.
[3395.36 --> 3399.06]  You doing the research on this before the NAS software comes out though,
[3399.06 --> 3402.76]  because I'm assuming you're going to have some video on the NAS software kind of does make sense.
[3402.76 --> 3403.50]  Um,
[3403.62 --> 3403.90]  yeah,
[3403.90 --> 3409.74]  but my whole thing with the NAS software is I want to have to do as little work and research as possible.
[3409.74 --> 3410.20]  Oh no,
[3410.24 --> 3410.50]  I mean,
[3410.56 --> 3411.48]  like if you're,
[3411.54 --> 3412.88]  if you're making a video like,
[3413.00 --> 3413.12]  Hey,
[3413.24 --> 3415.78]  do this stuff to set up your NAS or whatever.
[3415.88 --> 3416.18]  I don't know.
[3416.18 --> 3420.46]  having an informed opinion on the Plex jellyfin,
[3420.64 --> 3423.68]  whatever debate would be good.
[3423.98 --> 3424.30]  No,
[3424.42 --> 3425.26]  I probably won't.
[3425.36 --> 3425.50]  Oh,
[3425.60 --> 3425.72]  okay.
[3425.78 --> 3428.68]  Because a lot of my opinion is going to come down to ease of setup.
[3428.68 --> 3431.24]  And so my,
[3431.40 --> 3432.22]  my goal,
[3432.74 --> 3434.24]  my big ulterior motive,
[3434.48 --> 3436.04]  stay out of it with this whole,
[3436.20 --> 3444.42]  with this whole investment into hashtag was that whatever I want to install on a NAS that I think is good.
[3444.82 --> 3447.92]  I will have a back channel way of saying,
[3448.24 --> 3448.46]  Hey,
[3449.00 --> 3454.86]  can you guys support this and make sure that everything just works so that I don't have to think about it.
[3454.86 --> 3456.40]  And then by proxy,
[3456.56 --> 3459.08]  everyone else will be able to install,
[3459.24 --> 3469.98]  let's say Plex or image or whatever super easily and won't have to think about like the stupid permissions issues that like I switched,
[3470.16 --> 3473.28]  which VM I was using to download ISOs.
[3473.92 --> 3474.96]  And it,
[3475.08 --> 3475.62]  uh,
[3475.68 --> 3476.06]  it made,
[3476.22 --> 3477.16]  it made it so there's like,
[3477.26 --> 3483.02]  it turned it in like read only for certain app for certain like containers or,
[3483.02 --> 3483.44]  um,
[3483.44 --> 3485.06]  cause it was using like Kubernetes.
[3485.26 --> 3486.90]  I was on the older version of true NAS scale.
[3487.06 --> 3487.34]  It was just,
[3487.74 --> 3488.64]  just like such a,
[3488.74 --> 3489.38]  such a mess.
[3489.40 --> 3490.20]  And I'm sitting here going,
[3490.34 --> 3491.40]  I don't want any of this.
[3491.42 --> 3491.72]  I just,
[3492.08 --> 3494.52]  I just want to have my files and like,
[3494.54 --> 3497.94]  I can read and write them and stuff.
[3498.28 --> 3498.64]  Yeah.
[3498.66 --> 3498.84]  It was,
[3498.92 --> 3499.70]  it's the whole thing.
[3501.26 --> 3501.82]  All right.
[3502.96 --> 3503.58]  Are we,
[3503.68 --> 3504.32]  are we done now?
[3504.34 --> 3505.02]  Are we moving on?
[3506.34 --> 3506.86]  I don't know.
[3506.88 --> 3507.16]  Who knows?
[3507.20 --> 3507.54]  You want to,
[3507.60 --> 3508.26]  you want to pick a topic,
[3508.36 --> 3508.46]  Luke?
[3509.16 --> 3509.56]  Um,
[3509.66 --> 3511.44]  I'm this one,
[3511.84 --> 3512.46]  which one?
[3512.70 --> 3513.16]  Scroll up.
[3513.16 --> 3514.60]  Why don't you just be a man and say it?
[3515.56 --> 3515.86]  Cause,
[3516.08 --> 3517.62]  cause I don't know what's going on with it.
[3517.64 --> 3517.94]  Be a man,
[3518.00 --> 3518.58]  do the right thing.
[3518.92 --> 3519.52]  I fix it.
[3519.86 --> 3520.18]  Sure.
[3520.34 --> 3520.54]  Yeah.
[3520.62 --> 3521.10]  I fix it.
[3521.18 --> 3521.36]  What's happening there?
[3521.82 --> 3522.18]  Um,
[3522.64 --> 3522.94]  honestly,
[3522.94 --> 3523.36]  tell me,
[3523.50 --> 3524.08]  inform me.
[3524.24 --> 3524.66]  Honestly,
[3524.82 --> 3525.90]  I don't know.
[3526.16 --> 3527.98]  So why don't we do this together?
[3528.38 --> 3528.68]  Oh,
[3529.28 --> 3529.72]  oh boy.
[3530.02 --> 3531.78]  So earlier this week,
[3532.14 --> 3532.58]  yesterday,
[3532.78 --> 3533.36]  uh,
[3533.42 --> 3536.28]  I fix it announced their smart soldering iron.
[3536.44 --> 3536.80]  Uh,
[3536.80 --> 3538.16]  this thing's kind of wild by the way.
[3538.96 --> 3539.40]  It's,
[3539.68 --> 3540.06]  um,
[3540.50 --> 3541.22]  this is cool.
[3541.40 --> 3541.64]  100,
[3541.64 --> 3543.72]  100 watt heater ready to solder in five seconds.
[3543.88 --> 3548.20]  It can run off the wall for like an entire work day.
[3548.26 --> 3549.20]  I think they advertise.
[3549.44 --> 3555.70]  It has a literal web interface that you access through like Chrome,
[3556.32 --> 3556.82]  you know,
[3556.82 --> 3557.98]  like through a browser,
[3558.12 --> 3559.00]  like an actual,
[3559.32 --> 3559.66]  you know,
[3559.66 --> 3560.70]  like a web interface.
[3560.70 --> 3561.42]  Yeah.
[3561.62 --> 3563.20]  So that you can configure it.
[3563.82 --> 3564.22]  And,
[3564.32 --> 3564.74]  um,
[3565.12 --> 3565.38]  yeah,
[3565.48 --> 3565.88]  I don't know.
[3565.90 --> 3566.62]  It looks pretty cool.
[3566.82 --> 3570.04]  I've definitely seen some discussion around the price.
[3570.24 --> 3570.66]  Uh,
[3570.66 --> 3574.04]  by the time you buy the soldering iron and the dock and you know,
[3574.08 --> 3575.10]  whatever else people are saying,
[3575.14 --> 3576.58]  it's like hundreds of dollars,
[3576.70 --> 3583.44]  which when you compare to some of the more value oriented options,
[3583.64 --> 3584.14]  um,
[3584.20 --> 3585.20]  is not that competitive.
[3585.20 --> 3585.50]  Yeah.
[3585.58 --> 3588.88]  But there are also soldering irons that are wicked expensive.
[3588.88 --> 3589.80]  There are,
[3590.02 --> 3593.36]  but I think that for the people who are into like hackos,
[3593.58 --> 3595.74]  you're going to pry them from their cold dead hands.
[3596.04 --> 3596.44]  Yeah.
[3596.58 --> 3596.98]  I'm,
[3596.98 --> 3597.34]  um,
[3597.78 --> 3599.84]  showing our producer cam for no reason.
[3600.90 --> 3601.06]  Oh,
[3601.08 --> 3602.02]  I'm a JBC boy.
[3602.12 --> 3602.48]  Oh,
[3602.66 --> 3602.88]  really?
[3603.24 --> 3603.40]  Yeah.
[3603.56 --> 3603.92]  There you go.
[3604.00 --> 3604.68]  Rolls Royce,
[3604.78 --> 3605.06]  baby.
[3605.34 --> 3606.00]  Actually my,
[3606.14 --> 3608.48]  the one I have at home is like a $40 clone and it's like,
[3609.38 --> 3609.78]  okay,
[3609.90 --> 3611.38]  but it doesn't have a battery pack.
[3611.50 --> 3612.58]  You can't like move it around.
[3612.76 --> 3612.98]  Oh yeah,
[3613.00 --> 3613.32]  that's right.
[3613.44 --> 3613.76]  Dan's,
[3613.86 --> 3614.70]  Dan's the one,
[3614.82 --> 3617.98]  he's the one who made us spend a fortune on those stupid soldering stations.
[3618.26 --> 3618.42]  Isn't he?
[3618.58 --> 3618.86]  Dude.
[3619.54 --> 3620.52]  I was sitting there.
[3620.66 --> 3621.40]  They're a partner.
[3621.82 --> 3623.88]  This is not an endorsement,
[3623.98 --> 3626.80]  but I was sitting there trying to learn on my soldering iron.
[3627.02 --> 3627.36]  Oh yeah.
[3627.98 --> 3628.38]  This is,
[3628.48 --> 3629.38]  this actually happened.
[3629.50 --> 3629.62]  Yeah.
[3629.62 --> 3629.72]  Yeah.
[3629.72 --> 3629.92]  Yeah.
[3629.92 --> 3632.02]  I was trying to get Dan to like teach me how to solder.
[3632.34 --> 3632.52]  Yeah.
[3632.56 --> 3632.94]  And I was,
[3633.04 --> 3633.40]  you know,
[3633.64 --> 3634.36]  coming along,
[3634.42 --> 3635.56]  but I was struggling a little bit.
[3635.60 --> 3636.82]  And then he gave me the nice soldering iron.
[3636.92 --> 3637.84]  I instantly did it.
[3638.76 --> 3638.96]  Like,
[3639.38 --> 3640.02]  and cause you're,
[3640.08 --> 3641.56]  you're learning the techniques.
[3641.68 --> 3642.36]  You're not necessarily,
[3642.56 --> 3642.88]  cause you're,
[3643.52 --> 3647.00]  for me to use as a really broken soldering iron is difficult,
[3647.00 --> 3648.06]  but I know what's wrong.
[3648.06 --> 3649.10]  And for somebody learning,
[3649.10 --> 3650.66]  but you don't need like a,
[3650.66 --> 3654.60]  a $1,500 station to learn how to solder with.
[3654.82 --> 3655.18]  So it's like,
[3655.24 --> 3656.74]  it's definitely a skill issue.
[3656.96 --> 3657.08]  Yeah.
[3657.08 --> 3658.30]  It's for sure a skill issue,
[3658.30 --> 3661.72]  but still the nice soldering iron just made it so much easier.
[3661.72 --> 3667.28]  And something that has like temperature control like this and it can get hot really quickly and it's not super unwieldy.
[3667.66 --> 3671.14]  It's a nice thing about the JBCs is they are like this size for their,
[3671.20 --> 3672.76]  their ends and stuff like that,
[3672.78 --> 3674.44]  but they're ultra professional levels.
[3674.90 --> 3675.06]  Yeah.
[3675.28 --> 3675.72]  All right.
[3675.96 --> 3676.32]  So,
[3676.32 --> 3676.76]  um,
[3677.92 --> 3678.22]  whoops,
[3678.92 --> 3679.54]  where am I going?
[3679.66 --> 3680.16]  Last laptop.
[3680.22 --> 3680.54]  There we go.
[3680.54 --> 3681.04]  Uh,
[3681.04 --> 3681.86]  so back to this thing.
[3681.94 --> 3682.68]  So I've seen some,
[3682.80 --> 3684.08]  some commentary on the pricing.
[3684.22 --> 3685.74]  Some people are not super thrilled with it.
[3685.86 --> 3686.22]  Um,
[3686.22 --> 3687.00]  some people are,
[3687.12 --> 3688.16]  are more thrilled with it.
[3688.46 --> 3688.78]  Anyway,
[3689.02 --> 3689.36]  uh,
[3689.52 --> 3691.12]  Vitor responds and says,
[3691.20 --> 3693.64]  now I want an LTT soldering iron.
[3694.08 --> 3695.46]  And Kyle Weins,
[3695.60 --> 3696.14]  um,
[3696.26 --> 3697.30]  CEO of,
[3697.38 --> 3701.32]  I fix it says he does seem to be good at copying our products.
[3701.88 --> 3706.18]  There's been a fair amount of speculation as to what exactly he means by this.
[3706.18 --> 3707.34]  Is it gentle ribbing?
[3707.72 --> 3710.00]  Is it a genuine upset?
[3710.60 --> 3715.60]  And more than one person has pointed out that on the very day that he posted this,
[3715.70 --> 3717.66]  one of our videos went live with an,
[3717.68 --> 3719.10]  I fix it sponsorship in it.
[3719.62 --> 3720.14]  Um,
[3720.98 --> 3724.50]  so what I will say is I also don't know.
[3724.96 --> 3729.20]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reiterate everything that I've said about the,
[3729.20 --> 3732.94]  I fix it relationship and we'll go from there.
[3733.04 --> 3733.42]  Sure.
[3733.66 --> 3735.60]  So if it's gentle ribbing,
[3735.60 --> 3738.32]  gentle ribbing received,
[3738.86 --> 3739.48]  um,
[3740.08 --> 3742.02]  if it's not gentle ribbing,
[3742.12 --> 3742.72]  well,
[3743.20 --> 3743.72]  I don't know.
[3744.32 --> 3745.92]  We're good on our side.
[3746.22 --> 3746.68]  Um,
[3747.10 --> 3747.62]  we're chill.
[3747.80 --> 3748.82]  We believe in the,
[3748.96 --> 3749.62]  I fix it mission.
[3749.74 --> 3750.12]  Uh,
[3750.12 --> 3753.38]  we have absolutely no intention of becoming.
[3753.38 --> 3754.42]  I fix it.
[3754.62 --> 3755.18]  Uh,
[3755.18 --> 3755.88]  we're not gonna,
[3755.88 --> 3759.56]  we're not gonna even begin to approach the kind of,
[3759.56 --> 3760.10]  uh,
[3760.10 --> 3762.36]  replacement parts that they stock,
[3762.44 --> 3765.16]  the guides that they create through their community.
[3765.60 --> 3766.10]  Um,
[3766.20 --> 3766.40]  the,
[3766.58 --> 3768.74]  even the type of content that they produce,
[3768.76 --> 3771.66]  they do such a great job of their teardowns,
[3771.66 --> 3772.02]  um,
[3772.02 --> 3775.32]  that we've looked at doing that type of content before.
[3775.32 --> 3776.32]  And we've just kind of gone,
[3776.32 --> 3776.92]  yeah,
[3776.98 --> 3777.30]  I don't know,
[3777.38 --> 3777.56]  you know,
[3777.56 --> 3778.74]  maybe someday,
[3778.74 --> 3779.68]  but realistically,
[3779.68 --> 3782.40]  this seems like it's pretty well served,
[3782.48 --> 3782.64]  you know,
[3782.68 --> 3785.38]  evaluating the repairability of devices and stuff like that.
[3785.86 --> 3786.26]  Um,
[3786.90 --> 3788.44]  we absolutely value,
[3788.44 --> 3789.46]  I fix it as a partner.
[3789.46 --> 3796.82]  We specifically went out of our way to make our driver available as a standalone driver for people who just want a driver upgrade.
[3796.82 --> 3798.04]  And they're going to put it into their,
[3798.04 --> 3799.24]  I fix it kit and use it with their,
[3799.32 --> 3800.04]  I fix it bits.
[3800.20 --> 3805.22]  We went out of our way to make sure that our driver was compatible with I fix it bits.
[3805.24 --> 3806.28]  So there's a whole thing.
[3806.28 --> 3806.78]  Uh,
[3806.78 --> 3812.80]  we talked about it in the short circuit live stream when we announced our precision driver where the ISO standard is actually,
[3812.80 --> 3813.74]  uh,
[3813.74 --> 3814.80]  not what everyone,
[3815.08 --> 3816.50]  including I fix it does.
[3816.62 --> 3818.92]  And I forget the exact detail,
[3818.92 --> 3821.10]  but basically it comes down to manufacturing tolerances.
[3821.30 --> 3822.68]  So you're supposed to have,
[3822.68 --> 3823.30]  um,
[3823.74 --> 3824.66]  this socket,
[3824.96 --> 3826.94]  which is actually a,
[3827.20 --> 3828.14]  if I recall correctly,
[3828.44 --> 3832.00]  a metric translation of what is actually an Imperial size.
[3832.36 --> 3834.12]  So that's supposed to be the size.
[3834.16 --> 3835.50]  And then the bits are supposed to be smaller,
[3835.62 --> 3842.18]  but what everybody else does is they make the size bigger and the bits smaller or whatever.
[3842.18 --> 3848.08]  Basically you're supposed to make this big enough that at the upper range of the tolerances for the bit size,
[3848.18 --> 3849.00]  they'll fit for sure.
[3849.60 --> 3855.00]  And what we did was we made this at the lower range and then our bits were smaller.
[3855.24 --> 3855.94]  I forget.
[3856.48 --> 3856.82]  Hold on.
[3856.92 --> 3857.94]  Let me think about what it is.
[3858.14 --> 3860.42]  So what happened was our initial drivers,
[3861.02 --> 3862.16]  this was too small.
[3862.88 --> 3863.58]  That's right.
[3863.96 --> 3866.14]  So everyone else makes the bits,
[3866.26 --> 3866.82]  the size,
[3866.82 --> 3868.80]  and then they make their,
[3868.80 --> 3869.36]  um,
[3869.70 --> 3870.96]  their driver bigger,
[3871.10 --> 3871.78]  slightly oversized.
[3871.78 --> 3876.16]  And what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to make the socket the size,
[3876.50 --> 3876.68]  you know,
[3876.72 --> 3878.18]  four millimeters or whatever it is.
[3878.28 --> 3880.12]  And then the bits are supposed to be smaller.
[3880.46 --> 3881.98]  So in our first samples,
[3882.22 --> 3886.18]  we had bits and sockets that fit perfectly.
[3886.34 --> 3889.00]  But when we went to put someone else's bits in our sockets,
[3889.06 --> 3893.22]  we realized they were the ones that were at the high end of the tolerance range were too big.
[3893.32 --> 3896.80]  So we had to go back and we had to make ours wider like everyone else.
[3897.34 --> 3898.02]  And anyway,
[3898.16 --> 3898.60]  it doesn't matter.
[3898.60 --> 3903.20]  The point is that we went out of our way to make sure that the driver was compatible to reduce waste.
[3903.20 --> 3904.76]  So if people already have a set,
[3904.84 --> 3911.24]  they can upgrade to the fidget spinner slash precision driver without wasting all of the bits in the case that they already have.
[3911.24 --> 3912.02]  Um,
[3912.02 --> 3921.88]  but we also wanted to offer an option with the ideas that we had to improve the product that would include bits and,
[3921.88 --> 3922.22]  uh,
[3922.22 --> 3922.84]  and a case.
[3923.20 --> 3923.68]  So,
[3923.96 --> 3924.24]  you know,
[3924.34 --> 3925.66]  I don't know if he's,
[3925.78 --> 3927.16]  if he's serious about it.
[3927.38 --> 3927.84]  Um,
[3929.12 --> 3929.50]  I don't,
[3929.56 --> 3930.78]  I don't really know what to make of that.
[3930.78 --> 3930.98]  Um,
[3930.98 --> 3932.64]  we're still down to work together.
[3932.86 --> 3933.30]  Uh,
[3933.30 --> 3933.90]  I disagree.
[3934.40 --> 3938.30]  I guess I will say that I disagree that it's a copied product.
[3938.30 --> 3938.62]  Uh,
[3938.64 --> 3939.08]  I fix it.
[3939.12 --> 3941.06]  Didn't invent precision screwdrivers.
[3941.24 --> 3942.08]  I fix it.
[3942.12 --> 3942.84]  Didn't invent,
[3942.84 --> 3943.46]  um,
[3944.34 --> 3945.16]  bit cases.
[3945.64 --> 3946.08]  Um,
[3946.26 --> 3947.58]  and you know,
[3947.58 --> 3948.56]  from my point of view,
[3948.70 --> 3952.00]  either it's a copy at a higher price,
[3952.00 --> 3955.26]  in which case he shouldn't be worried about it.
[3955.26 --> 3955.86]  Right.
[3956.10 --> 3962.06]  Or it's a product that innovated with things like this magnetically detachable,
[3962.42 --> 3964.66]  nicely cool stackable case,
[3965.12 --> 3965.56]  uh,
[3965.86 --> 3968.36]  deeper bits that make their way into,
[3968.36 --> 3968.86]  you know,
[3969.14 --> 3970.74]  recessed housings more easily.
[3971.50 --> 3972.10]  Um,
[3972.42 --> 3974.68]  an all metal driver that has bit storage.
[3974.80 --> 3975.84]  They do have one with bit storage,
[3975.84 --> 3977.24]  but it's not all metal,
[3977.24 --> 3977.88]  uh,
[3977.88 --> 3978.98]  higher quality bearing,
[3979.16 --> 3980.22]  replaceable tops,
[3980.52 --> 3981.28]  stronger magnet.
[3982.06 --> 3982.46]  Um,
[3982.88 --> 3983.08]  no,
[3983.12 --> 3983.78]  I think it's a,
[3983.86 --> 3989.10]  I think it's about as different as a product can be and still be a precision screwdriver.
[3989.80 --> 3990.20]  Um,
[3990.24 --> 3990.44]  oh,
[3990.54 --> 3991.12]  we added,
[3991.48 --> 3993.52]  we added magnets to the inside.
[3993.68 --> 3994.00]  Yeah,
[3994.00 --> 3994.36]  that's nice.
[3994.48 --> 3995.16]  It's a parts tray.
[3995.36 --> 3995.52]  Yeah.
[3995.86 --> 3996.22]  Yeah.
[3996.76 --> 3997.50]  And to be clear,
[3997.58 --> 3999.34]  the I fix it one can also be used as a parts tray,
[3999.40 --> 4000.32]  but it won't be magnetic.
[4000.54 --> 4000.74]  Yeah.
[4001.84 --> 4002.70]  So there you go.
[4002.94 --> 4003.22]  Uh,
[4003.22 --> 4003.54]  so yeah,
[4003.54 --> 4004.20]  I don't know.
[4004.42 --> 4005.06]  Is he mad?
[4005.46 --> 4005.94]  Who knows?
[4006.44 --> 4007.88]  Are we working on a soldering iron?
[4008.30 --> 4009.20]  Not at this time,
[4009.30 --> 4011.20]  but if we thought there was room to,
[4011.20 --> 4012.74]  innovate and make a better soldering iron,
[4012.80 --> 4014.04]  I'm not going to rule out anything.
[4014.56 --> 4014.82]  Uh,
[4014.82 --> 4019.40]  we definitely have other products in our roadmap that are tools and therefore will probably
[4019.40 --> 4021.64]  overlap with anyone who sells tools.
[4021.64 --> 4028.38]  But part of our product development philosophy is that we don't just make the same thing that's already out there.
[4028.58 --> 4030.50]  If we aren't adding something,
[4031.10 --> 4031.40]  then,
[4031.40 --> 4033.24]  um,
[4033.38 --> 4035.40]  I don't see why we'd bother.
[4035.52 --> 4036.38]  And in some cases,
[4036.38 --> 4038.74]  what we're adding can be as simple as,
[4038.74 --> 4039.20]  uh,
[4039.24 --> 4040.42]  making it more affordable.
[4040.86 --> 4041.30]  Like,
[4041.30 --> 4045.78]  most things I have to do around my house basically just require a screwdriver.
[4046.00 --> 4047.88]  So I have LTT screwdrivers for everything.
[4048.66 --> 4049.18]  Uh,
[4049.18 --> 4050.48]  I had to use a hammer last night.
[4051.54 --> 4052.70]  Wasn't an LTT hammer.
[4053.02 --> 4053.58]  I disappointed.
[4054.12 --> 4055.00]  We actually,
[4055.24 --> 4058.56]  we actually do have a potential product spec for a hammer.
[4059.10 --> 4060.44]  I have some ideas.
[4062.20 --> 4062.64]  Okay.
[4062.64 --> 4064.96]  That was entirely a joke,
[4065.10 --> 4065.80]  but all right.
[4066.66 --> 4067.04]  No,
[4067.14 --> 4067.28]  I,
[4067.28 --> 4067.46]  I,
[4067.58 --> 4068.28]  it's true.
[4068.34 --> 4068.58]  I mean,
[4068.60 --> 4070.58]  what I said is not untrue.
[4070.70 --> 4072.58]  I used a hammer last night and I,
[4072.58 --> 4072.76]  I,
[4072.76 --> 4074.84]  I literally pulled it out and was like,
[4074.84 --> 4075.40]  huh,
[4076.04 --> 4077.06]  it's like blue.
[4078.20 --> 4080.08]  It's not orange and black.
[4080.48 --> 4081.54]  I have ideas.
[4081.82 --> 4082.22]  All right.
[4082.62 --> 4083.04]  Um,
[4083.56 --> 4084.26]  and you know what?
[4084.32 --> 4086.90]  Sometimes it can be as simple as coming in at a lower price.
[4086.90 --> 4092.62]  Like I think that anti-static work mats are over,
[4092.64 --> 4094.12]  overpriced essentially.
[4094.12 --> 4095.36]  So our mod mat,
[4095.46 --> 4095.96]  uh,
[4095.96 --> 4098.70]  which we actually created in collaboration with mod,
[4098.76 --> 4098.96]  right?
[4098.96 --> 4100.96]  Who has been doing mod mats for,
[4100.96 --> 4102.02]  uh,
[4102.02 --> 4103.82]  Lord only knows how long they,
[4104.06 --> 4104.64]  um,
[4105.08 --> 4105.98]  didn't they patent it?
[4105.98 --> 4106.34]  Yeah.
[4106.48 --> 4106.70]  Yeah.
[4106.70 --> 4107.20]  Like way,
[4107.20 --> 4108.34]  way back in the day.
[4108.34 --> 4108.76]  So they're,
[4108.80 --> 4109.00]  they're,
[4109.06 --> 4109.76]  they're pretty OG.
[4110.14 --> 4110.38]  Uh,
[4110.38 --> 4113.22]  so we actually partnered with them and ours is going to be coming soon.
[4113.22 --> 4116.84]  And it's going to be very price competitive compared to what's out there.
[4116.84 --> 4118.50]  And that's still like profitable.
[4118.76 --> 4119.08]  So,
[4119.50 --> 4120.30]  so yeah,
[4120.30 --> 4120.80]  if we see,
[4120.80 --> 4124.30]  if we see an area where we can improve the state of the market,
[4124.30 --> 4125.92]  then yeah,
[4125.94 --> 4126.66]  we'll go for it.
[4126.78 --> 4127.14]  Uh,
[4127.14 --> 4127.84]  but if we don't,
[4127.90 --> 4128.68]  then we're not just,
[4128.96 --> 4131.50]  we're not just looking to come in and copy someone else's product.
[4131.50 --> 4132.56]  And I,
[4132.66 --> 4133.52]  I reject,
[4133.90 --> 4137.62]  I reject the assertion that this is a copied product.
[4137.62 --> 4138.68]  And if it is a copied product,
[4138.68 --> 4141.04]  they should have no problem recopying it.
[4141.04 --> 4142.54]  And then there's is better.
[4142.54 --> 4144.66]  And that's how competition as a competition works.
[4145.18 --> 4146.44]  Then everybody's product is better.
[4146.48 --> 4146.64]  I mean,
[4146.64 --> 4147.80]  we didn't patent anything here,
[4147.80 --> 4149.78]  even if we could have,
[4149.86 --> 4150.56]  which I really,
[4150.76 --> 4150.78]  I,
[4150.88 --> 4151.20]  you know,
[4151.54 --> 4153.02]  I don't think we could have,
[4153.32 --> 4154.40]  but even if we could have,
[4154.60 --> 4155.18]  we're not,
[4155.46 --> 4156.92]  that's not really how we roll.
[4157.12 --> 4160.44]  I do think at some point we'll probably have to patent something.
[4160.44 --> 4161.44]  Um,
[4162.32 --> 4165.44]  but that's not a bridge that we've really had to cross yet.
[4166.44 --> 4168.36]  I think if we ever did like a,
[4168.60 --> 4169.76]  like a new,
[4169.76 --> 4172.18]  you know what?
[4172.20 --> 4173.90]  It's probably better for me to just not even say,
[4174.00 --> 4176.30]  there are a couple of things that we have in development that could
[4176.30 --> 4178.02]  potentially benefit from being patented,
[4178.14 --> 4178.38]  but
[4178.38 --> 4182.66]  for patent tax,
[4182.72 --> 4182.90]  right?
[4182.94 --> 4183.14]  Off.
[4183.24 --> 4183.46]  Yeah,
[4183.48 --> 4183.78]  sure.
[4184.00 --> 4185.00]  Let me get right on that.
[4188.36 --> 4189.06]  All right.
[4189.52 --> 4189.92]  Yeah.
[4190.44 --> 4190.72]  Okay.
[4190.96 --> 4191.34]  So anyway,
[4191.56 --> 4192.56]  hopefully we're still cool.
[4192.88 --> 4193.34]  We love you.
[4193.38 --> 4193.92]  I fix it.
[4194.22 --> 4194.64]  And,
[4194.70 --> 4195.10]  um,
[4196.14 --> 4197.04]  if you guys are mad,
[4197.44 --> 4197.98]  um,
[4199.18 --> 4199.62]  sorry.
[4201.26 --> 4202.38]  Speaking of madness,
[4202.60 --> 4204.14]  the U S government pushes for,
[4204.28 --> 4206.08]  the doc just keeps floating around.
[4206.18 --> 4206.34]  Uh,
[4206.34 --> 4208.70]  the U S government pushes for greater VPN access.
[4208.84 --> 4209.50]  Last week,
[4209.64 --> 4211.02]  the white house met with Amazon,
[4211.20 --> 4211.36]  Google,
[4211.48 --> 4211.82]  Microsoft,
[4211.94 --> 4212.54]  and cloud flare,
[4212.54 --> 4217.36]  as well as civil society advocates to encourage tech companies to offer more
[4217.36 --> 4219.84]  digital bandwidth for government funded,
[4219.84 --> 4221.54]  internet censorship,
[4221.54 --> 4223.18]  internet censorship evasion tools,
[4223.18 --> 4224.54]  which,
[4224.66 --> 4225.12]  uh,
[4225.12 --> 4227.30]  is an insane sentence to me,
[4227.30 --> 4227.84]  uh,
[4227.84 --> 4230.88]  tools supported by the open technology fund or the OTF,
[4231.02 --> 4235.34]  which is funded by the U S government have surged in popularity in countries like Russia,
[4235.48 --> 4235.90]  Iran,
[4236.22 --> 4236.84]  Myanmar,
[4236.84 --> 4237.74]  uh,
[4237.74 --> 4238.58]  Oh,
[4238.66 --> 4239.14]  and Myanmar.
[4239.30 --> 4239.42]  Sorry.
[4239.52 --> 4240.24]  I missed the end.
[4240.60 --> 4242.12]  According to OTF president,
[4242.24 --> 4243.22]  Laura Cunningham,
[4243.32 --> 4252.80]  the number of VPN users they support has more than quadrupled over the last few years to around 46 million users each month.
[4252.80 --> 4259.24]  The OTF wants discounted or subsidized server bandwidth to help meet that growing demand.
[4260.64 --> 4261.46]  What is,
[4261.92 --> 4267.16]  which to me sounds like the government is basically being like,
[4267.38 --> 4267.78]  yeah,
[4267.78 --> 4270.80]  we don't really care if you like pirate movies and music and stuff.
[4270.88 --> 4271.68]  We want all your data.
[4271.68 --> 4273.76]  that's,
[4273.84 --> 4274.46]  that's my,
[4274.76 --> 4277.16]  that's what I get from this personally.
[4277.86 --> 4279.68]  Tools supported by the OTF,
[4280.20 --> 4283.10]  which is funded by the U S government have surged in popularity in countries.
[4283.18 --> 4283.50]  So they,
[4283.50 --> 4284.18]  they want,
[4284.28 --> 4285.10]  you know,
[4285.18 --> 4287.42]  resistant groups and whatnot that are in,
[4287.42 --> 4287.68]  uh,
[4288.68 --> 4292.80]  maybe not super friendly to U S countries to be able to do their thing.
[4292.80 --> 4296.90]  But do they want encryption for their own citizens?
[4300.34 --> 4308.92]  This would allow them to see all the things to encourage tech companies to offer more digital bandwidth for government funded internet censorship evasion tools.
[4308.92 --> 4310.44]  Isn't that such a wild sentence?
[4310.82 --> 4311.10]  Huh?
[4312.34 --> 4312.62]  But,
[4312.78 --> 4313.22]  but,
[4313.82 --> 4314.04]  but,
[4314.04 --> 4314.22]  but,
[4314.22 --> 4316.04]  um,
[4317.04 --> 4320.08]  interesting.
[4320.48 --> 4320.76]  Yeah.
[4320.76 --> 4324.58]  I don't know a ton about the OTF.
[4325.44 --> 4330.60]  I don't know how far the fingers of the U S government are in the OTF,
[4330.60 --> 4333.96]  but if you run the VPN yourself,
[4335.56 --> 4339.74]  you can do a whole heck of a lot.
[4340.02 --> 4342.50]  But are they saying they're running the VPN?
[4342.50 --> 4343.08]  I don't know.
[4343.20 --> 4343.46]  I don't know.
[4343.48 --> 4347.66]  Or are they saying they want tech companies to offer more bandwidth weight for,
[4347.74 --> 4350.74]  but for government funded censorship evasion tools?
[4350.76 --> 4351.48]  For those,
[4351.76 --> 4352.78]  not for all of them.
[4354.00 --> 4354.78]  For those.
[4358.78 --> 4361.06]  It's very interesting to me.
[4361.50 --> 4361.94]  Uh,
[4362.68 --> 4363.20]  it's,
[4363.28 --> 4363.42]  it,
[4363.42 --> 4365.00]  it sounds like a,
[4365.00 --> 4366.60]  a two pronged attack.
[4366.72 --> 4367.04]  Uh huh.
[4367.14 --> 4368.28]  This is the vibe that I'm getting.
[4368.38 --> 4368.60]  So the,
[4368.64 --> 4370.16]  the one prong is,
[4370.32 --> 4370.50]  Hey,
[4370.64 --> 4373.16]  we get to help groups that are in Russia,
[4373.28 --> 4373.54]  Iran,
[4373.66 --> 4373.92]  Myanmar,
[4373.92 --> 4375.14]  and other places.
[4375.24 --> 4375.50]  Uh huh.
[4375.56 --> 4375.74]  Yeah.
[4375.74 --> 4375.90]  Yeah.
[4375.90 --> 4376.04]  Yeah.
[4376.04 --> 4376.08]  Yeah.
[4376.08 --> 4376.24]  Which,
[4376.36 --> 4377.02]  which is valid,
[4377.14 --> 4378.92]  which is probably something that they want to do.
[4378.92 --> 4379.98]  They need to be able to communicate and organize.
[4380.16 --> 4380.96]  A multitude of reasons.
[4380.96 --> 4381.16]  Yeah,
[4381.18 --> 4381.46]  for sure.
[4381.50 --> 4381.78]  For sure.
[4382.18 --> 4384.14]  And then the other one is like,
[4384.28 --> 4384.48]  Oh,
[4384.52 --> 4384.94]  I don't know.
[4385.00 --> 4385.36]  And if,
[4385.52 --> 4386.52]  if other people use it,
[4387.14 --> 4389.30]  we get to have a really good look into what they're up to.
[4389.42 --> 4389.54]  Well,
[4389.56 --> 4389.76]  yeah.
[4390.08 --> 4390.48]  Um,
[4390.90 --> 4391.28]  wow.
[4391.96 --> 4394.02]  46 million users a month.
[4394.12 --> 4394.30]  Wild.
[4398.06 --> 4399.42]  OTF VPNs.
[4400.42 --> 4400.82]  Yeah.
[4400.82 --> 4401.18]  Like what,
[4401.20 --> 4401.84]  what is a note?
[4401.92 --> 4403.60]  What is an OTF VPN?
[4403.88 --> 4404.30]  Like what?
[4409.28 --> 4409.68]  Oh,
[4410.38 --> 4410.66]  no,
[4410.70 --> 4411.60]  this is good stuff.
[4413.02 --> 4413.42]  Like,
[4413.44 --> 4414.42]  do they do open VPN?
[4414.58 --> 4415.94]  Did I see an open VPN logo?
[4416.10 --> 4417.98]  I recognize that logo immediately.
[4418.20 --> 4418.46]  Yeah.
[4418.56 --> 4418.80]  So wait,
[4418.84 --> 4418.92]  no,
[4418.92 --> 4420.02]  this is like good then.
[4420.80 --> 4424.54]  So these are tools that you can use to build VPNs.
[4424.74 --> 4426.38]  Like this is not necessarily.
[4427.06 --> 4428.02]  Very interesting.
[4428.10 --> 4428.38]  Cause I,
[4428.50 --> 4429.48]  I don't know though.
[4429.64 --> 4432.72]  I'm not aware of like a sick backdoor in open VPN.
[4435.94 --> 4437.68]  I don't know what this means though,
[4437.68 --> 4439.16]  or if this is just a list of things.
[4439.16 --> 4439.36]  Like,
[4439.38 --> 4440.20]  I don't know if this means,
[4440.34 --> 4440.64]  um,
[4443.70 --> 4444.54]  do they make,
[4444.72 --> 4447.56]  are they responsible for open VPN guys?
[4447.88 --> 4448.46]  I don't know.
[4448.46 --> 4448.82]  No,
[4449.16 --> 4449.78]  help me out here.
[4449.92 --> 4450.92]  Genuinely no idea.
[4452.92 --> 4453.32]  Like,
[4453.32 --> 4453.88]  I don't want to,
[4453.94 --> 4457.16]  I don't want to get into like a wire guard versus open VPN debate.
[4457.30 --> 4457.38]  Like,
[4457.46 --> 4459.28]  but wire guard may be better.
[4459.50 --> 4459.88]  It's on here though.
[4460.46 --> 4461.22]  It's on this list.
[4461.34 --> 4462.50]  That's why I'm saying,
[4462.56 --> 4462.70]  like,
[4462.70 --> 4465.38]  I'm not sure what this list necessarily means.
[4465.66 --> 4465.82]  Like,
[4465.86 --> 4468.06]  do they just might just be a list of things.
[4468.06 --> 4468.36]  Yeah.
[4468.44 --> 4469.82]  Maybe they're part of the funding.
[4469.88 --> 4471.82]  I see open VPN wire guard and tour.
[4472.36 --> 4473.00]  I see this.
[4473.16 --> 4473.52]  Okay.
[4473.60 --> 4476.58]  But I don't necessarily know if this means more,
[4476.70 --> 4478.60]  this is from the open tech fund,
[4478.60 --> 4480.88]  or if this means this is the funding that it's received.
[4480.96 --> 4481.42]  You know what I mean?
[4481.42 --> 4486.28]  They've got to have received more funding than that overall.
[4486.82 --> 4486.94]  Oh,
[4487.00 --> 4487.02]  no,
[4487.08 --> 4487.16]  wait,
[4487.22 --> 4488.20]  maybe that is overall.
[4488.72 --> 4491.18]  Cause it says free and open source software sustainability fund.
[4491.28 --> 4492.58]  Your mom's an open VPN.
[4493.22 --> 4493.84]  Why do we even,
[4493.98 --> 4495.48]  why do we even talk to any of our chats?
[4495.48 --> 4496.34]  Read the last paragraph.
[4497.66 --> 4498.86]  Through the FOSS sustainability fund,
[4498.94 --> 4501.32]  open VPN will focus on growing its core contributor.
[4502.02 --> 4502.34]  Okay.
[4502.54 --> 4503.20]  This isn't the,
[4503.72 --> 4504.14]  is,
[4504.26 --> 4505.92]  is that a different thing?
[4506.04 --> 4506.58]  I don't know.
[4508.16 --> 4508.42]  Okay.
[4508.42 --> 4512.82]  Is the FOSS sustainability fund a fund within the open technology fund?
[4514.60 --> 4515.52]  I don't know.
[4515.60 --> 4516.86]  I don't know where this rabbit hole goes,
[4517.54 --> 4518.22]  but it's,
[4518.42 --> 4519.24]  it's definitely.
[4519.90 --> 4521.48]  So there may be downsides,
[4521.48 --> 4524.32]  but fundamentally it's probably good.
[4524.38 --> 4527.30]  Better VPN access seems probably good.
[4527.38 --> 4527.58]  Good.
[4528.78 --> 4529.22]  Okay.
[4530.00 --> 4531.06]  I'm going to say,
[4531.18 --> 4533.62]  I'm going to say it's a W for now.
[4533.92 --> 4534.40]  Yeah.
[4534.40 --> 4536.74]  And hopefully I don't end up eating those words.
[4537.34 --> 4537.78]  Yeah.
[4538.08 --> 4540.14]  We don't have very good information on this,
[4540.22 --> 4541.74]  so I don't think we can really say much,
[4541.82 --> 4542.20]  unfortunately,
[4542.40 --> 4542.98]  but we'll move on.
[4543.22 --> 4546.26]  What I would like to talk about is Nvidia purses.
[4546.42 --> 4546.54]  Yeah.
[4546.60 --> 4546.78]  What?
[4549.38 --> 4550.36]  AI researcher,
[4550.36 --> 4561.96]  Teresa Barton is selling a limited run of 10 purses crafted out of Nvidia GeForce GT 730 graphics cards for $1024 or $1024.
[4562.36 --> 4567.56]  Her website also indicates that she will at some point be selling a handmade bag made out of a handbag.
[4567.56 --> 4568.38]  Uh,
[4568.52 --> 4568.84]  yes.
[4568.94 --> 4574.56]  A handbag made out of a H100 AI chip for $65,536.
[4575.20 --> 4580.88]  While Barton says the cards themselves are non-functional and ethically sourced from data center dumpsters,
[4581.34 --> 4582.46]  the fans still work,
[4582.72 --> 4583.12]  which is,
[4583.22 --> 4583.48]  I mean,
[4583.52 --> 4583.88]  that's,
[4584.14 --> 4584.56]  uh,
[4584.74 --> 4587.30]  that's neat.
[4587.46 --> 4587.84]  That's cool.
[4588.50 --> 4588.78]  Yeah.
[4588.90 --> 4589.24]  I don't know.
[4589.36 --> 4591.36]  Is there like a little battery bank somewhere to power the fan?
[4591.36 --> 4592.82]  I see the fan has its,
[4592.96 --> 4595.10]  the fan is on the outside and it has its own plug.
[4595.44 --> 4595.80]  Yeah.
[4595.80 --> 4596.48]  There's gotta be,
[4596.58 --> 4597.36]  there's gotta be something there.
[4597.50 --> 4598.92]  Gotta be a battery in there or something.
[4599.64 --> 4603.28]  I think one of my questions is how much stuff can you actually store in this purse?
[4603.38 --> 4603.48]  Like,
[4603.56 --> 4604.84]  is it purely aesthetic?
[4605.14 --> 4607.30]  I do think that they look surprisingly neat.
[4608.22 --> 4608.58]  Yeah.
[4608.84 --> 4611.92]  I read this title and was like,
[4612.00 --> 4612.14]  oh,
[4612.16 --> 4612.94]  it's going to look like junk.
[4612.94 --> 4615.64]  And then I saw the actual purse thing and I was like,
[4615.70 --> 4615.90]  oh,
[4616.66 --> 4618.30]  it's not too bad.
[4618.48 --> 4619.20]  What is,
[4619.32 --> 4619.56]  um,
[4619.70 --> 4620.26]  what is the,
[4620.56 --> 4623.08]  what is the justification for the price here?
[4623.10 --> 4626.60]  Because she literally says they're made of e-waste.
[4627.14 --> 4627.58]  Um,
[4627.90 --> 4628.34]  I don't know.
[4628.60 --> 4630.00]  I think purses in general,
[4630.10 --> 4631.00]  it's just,
[4631.10 --> 4631.60]  there's prices,
[4631.74 --> 4631.98]  whatever.
[4632.24 --> 4632.50]  How,
[4632.50 --> 4636.74]  how do these items end up so divorced from their costs?
[4637.08 --> 4637.48]  Um,
[4637.72 --> 4637.92]  like,
[4637.98 --> 4638.74]  is this,
[4638.74 --> 4642.44]  like about here,
[4642.50 --> 4642.68]  here,
[4642.68 --> 4643.26]  is there like,
[4643.32 --> 4645.34]  I honestly think if you try to figure this out,
[4645.42 --> 4646.92]  you're just going to hurt your brain.
[4647.08 --> 4647.90]  Is there an objective?
[4648.22 --> 4648.40]  Like,
[4648.44 --> 4649.22]  is she,
[4649.42 --> 4650.98]  is this contributing to,
[4651.08 --> 4651.22]  Oh,
[4651.28 --> 4653.44]  I think 1024 is just computer number.
[4653.82 --> 4654.00]  No,
[4654.04 --> 4654.14]  no,
[4654.14 --> 4654.32]  no,
[4654.32 --> 4654.42]  no,
[4654.42 --> 4654.82]  no,
[4654.82 --> 4654.96]  no,
[4654.96 --> 4655.00]  no,
[4655.00 --> 4655.04]  no,
[4655.04 --> 4655.92]  that's not what I meant by that.
[4656.04 --> 4656.32]  I don't know.
[4656.76 --> 4657.36]  Oh my,
[4657.42 --> 4659.04]  I just got assaulted by LTT ads.
[4659.12 --> 4659.20]  Oh,
[4659.24 --> 4659.86]  they just went away.
[4660.22 --> 4660.82]  I get it.
[4660.88 --> 4663.90]  All of the verticals of ads on this website,
[4663.98 --> 4664.60]  which there are many,
[4664.68 --> 4667.36]  they were all LTT ads for a split second and then they went away.
[4667.52 --> 4667.78]  Oh,
[4668.08 --> 4668.46]  sorry.
[4668.76 --> 4669.16]  I just,
[4669.26 --> 4669.60]  I was,
[4669.70 --> 4672.42]  I was kind of expecting it to say like,
[4672.42 --> 4672.96]  Oh yeah.
[4673.18 --> 4673.58]  Um,
[4674.68 --> 4679.00]  proceeds are going to some kind of research into AI something,
[4679.26 --> 4679.56]  but no,
[4679.58 --> 4680.98]  this appears to be just like,
[4681.16 --> 4681.50]  I don't know.
[4681.54 --> 4684.82]  Maybe she's just a bespoke designer that made only 10 of a thing.
[4684.82 --> 4686.12]  And if you're going to do that,
[4686.24 --> 4687.24]  you're going to charge a bunch.
[4688.24 --> 4688.68]  Yeah,
[4688.72 --> 4689.52]  I guess so.
[4691.42 --> 4691.86]  Okay.
[4691.86 --> 4692.86]  Uh,
[4692.86 --> 4697.16]  sure.
[4697.36 --> 4697.62]  Well,
[4697.72 --> 4697.92]  Hey,
[4698.00 --> 4698.64]  you know what?
[4699.36 --> 4700.52]  I wish you luck.
[4702.44 --> 4704.32]  I bet you at least one person bought it.
[4704.42 --> 4704.98]  You think so?
[4705.16 --> 4705.92]  I feel like it.
[4706.36 --> 4707.04]  You think so?
[4707.20 --> 4707.70]  I think so.
[4708.46 --> 4709.08]  I don't know,
[4709.16 --> 4709.36]  dude.
[4709.76 --> 4710.14]  I,
[4710.26 --> 4710.64]  um,
[4710.90 --> 4712.34]  I think that seems pretty unlikely.
[4712.34 --> 4719.54]  I think even most people who spend a lot of money on purses probably expect to be able to carry something in them.
[4720.88 --> 4724.32]  I do not agree with that statement at all.
[4727.66 --> 4728.10]  Wow.
[4730.02 --> 4730.88]  I don't really,
[4731.00 --> 4733.86]  I don't really understand what I'm looking at here.
[4734.38 --> 4739.64]  So you're basically telling me this purchase is ineligible for this.
[4739.64 --> 4740.78]  Why is it even here then?
[4742.24 --> 4742.60]  Um,
[4742.74 --> 4746.16]  I guess shop probably doesn't deal with a lot of things that are over 30 grand.
[4746.22 --> 4747.58]  So they never really thought about that scenario.
[4748.64 --> 4749.04]  Yeah.
[4749.04 --> 4750.08]  This just seems like,
[4750.16 --> 4750.30]  like,
[4750.32 --> 4750.70]  is she just,
[4750.80 --> 4751.80]  is this a social experiment?
[4751.90 --> 4753.10]  Is she just trying to grab headlines?
[4753.14 --> 4753.56]  Like this,
[4753.62 --> 4754.30]  this can't,
[4754.30 --> 4756.54]  this can't seriously be the best,
[4757.38 --> 4757.58]  the,
[4757.74 --> 4758.72]  the best sales pitch.
[4758.88 --> 4758.92]  Oh,
[4758.98 --> 4760.88]  is this like $60,000 one?
[4760.96 --> 4761.10]  Yeah.
[4761.30 --> 4761.52]  Yeah.
[4761.52 --> 4763.72]  I don't think she thinks anyone's going to buy it personally,
[4763.72 --> 4764.32]  but like,
[4764.70 --> 4764.88]  you,
[4765.00 --> 4765.48]  you know,
[4765.50 --> 4767.02]  enough rare,
[4767.02 --> 4769.06]  one of a kind GPT for training GPU.
[4769.06 --> 4769.26]  You know,
[4769.26 --> 4770.06]  there's lots of them.
[4770.40 --> 4770.70]  Um,
[4770.70 --> 4773.38]  and if you know enough to know about GPT,
[4773.58 --> 4778.14]  then you'd think you could just use chat GPT to like write a better description for it.
[4778.14 --> 4780.20]  That's literally all it says on this entire page.
[4780.34 --> 4781.90]  This particular page,
[4781.90 --> 4784.94]  I think is more about the bringing eyeballs in.
[4785.22 --> 4785.66]  Like she's,
[4785.76 --> 4787.10]  I think she's memeing dude.
[4787.44 --> 4787.66]  Oh,
[4787.70 --> 4788.90]  at least to a certain degree.
[4788.98 --> 4789.28]  Yeah.
[4789.50 --> 4790.36]  Fits a phone.
[4791.14 --> 4791.60]  Nice.
[4792.44 --> 4792.72]  Yeah.
[4793.64 --> 4795.00]  Long or short chain available?
[4795.44 --> 4797.00]  I bet at least one has sold.
[4797.16 --> 4797.90]  I think she's memeing.
[4798.04 --> 4798.90]  That doesn't look good.
[4798.90 --> 4800.52]  The other pictures looked pretty good.
[4800.68 --> 4800.84]  Well,
[4800.94 --> 4805.30]  the pictures are just stupid because this picture is not a GT seven 30.
[4805.42 --> 4806.10]  This is the H,
[4806.22 --> 4806.92]  uh,
[4806.92 --> 4807.86]  the H 100 one.
[4808.02 --> 4810.38]  So what is it doing on this product page?
[4810.82 --> 4811.26]  Like,
[4811.30 --> 4812.34]  what is this doing here?
[4812.38 --> 4813.60]  This is not any of those things.
[4813.60 --> 4813.98]  This is,
[4814.06 --> 4814.62]  this is ancient.
[4814.72 --> 4815.30]  This is like,
[4815.30 --> 4816.00]  uh,
[4816.30 --> 4817.00]  yeah.
[4817.00 --> 4817.76]  GF 100.
[4817.90 --> 4818.70]  This is Fermi.
[4819.04 --> 4819.80]  This is a,
[4819.84 --> 4820.84]  this is a four 80.
[4822.48 --> 4823.02]  So like,
[4823.04 --> 4823.52]  what am I even,
[4824.00 --> 4825.74]  I don't think she expects to sell any.
[4825.80 --> 4826.60]  I think she's memeing.
[4826.82 --> 4827.28]  Should I buy one?
[4827.36 --> 4827.96]  I still know,
[4827.96 --> 4830.72]  but I bet you she sold one because of what you just did.
[4831.44 --> 4832.52]  Don't actually do it.
[4833.34 --> 4833.60]  I'm not.
[4833.60 --> 4833.88]  I don't,
[4833.88 --> 4835.20]  I want to know if it's a real site.
[4835.28 --> 4837.86]  Am I actually going to get a purse in the mail?
[4838.22 --> 4838.96]  Do you want my credit card?
[4839.32 --> 4839.50]  No,
[4839.56 --> 4839.96]  I don't want it.
[4839.96 --> 4843.50]  The only way I'm going to get an H 100.
[4843.50 --> 4845.40]  At some random time in the show,
[4845.46 --> 4846.80]  you should throw that thing back at me.
[4847.60 --> 4847.84]  What?
[4848.44 --> 4849.00]  I'm sorry.
[4849.04 --> 4849.64]  I was talking.
[4849.90 --> 4850.00]  No,
[4850.04 --> 4850.36]  it's fine.
[4850.42 --> 4851.68]  Just the thing I threw at you.
[4851.68 --> 4853.14]  Do you want your water bottle back?
[4853.70 --> 4855.70]  But he didn't throw a water bottle at you,
[4855.76 --> 4855.94]  Dan.
[4856.08 --> 4857.32]  It's on your side of the table.
[4858.44 --> 4859.06]  With this?
[4859.24 --> 4860.14]  That's my water bottle.
[4860.58 --> 4860.68]  Yeah.
[4860.68 --> 4860.92]  Oh,
[4861.00 --> 4861.66]  I drank from it.
[4861.76 --> 4862.50]  I couldn't find yours.
[4862.78 --> 4862.96]  Oh,
[4863.44 --> 4863.74]  okay.
[4863.86 --> 4864.00]  Well,
[4864.06 --> 4864.74]  do you have any diseases?
[4864.94 --> 4865.64]  I'm sure we've done worse.
[4867.36 --> 4868.02]  Pre-show,
[4868.14 --> 4868.30]  baby.
[4869.14 --> 4870.30]  Subscribe to Floatplane.
[4870.30 --> 4874.86]  And subscribe to our sponsor,

[4878.78 --> 4878.92]  Oh,
[4878.96 --> 4879.76]  he's actually doing it.
[4880.82 --> 4882.52]  But if you don't like blonde,
[4882.98 --> 4883.54]  trim it.
[4884.08 --> 4884.76]  Our sponsor,
[4884.92 --> 4885.52]  Manscaped,

[4910.70 --> 4913.86]  to illuminate the trickiest spots.
[4915.86 --> 4916.42]  Okay.
[4916.66 --> 4918.70]  The Lawnmower 5.0 Ultra Gold Edition
[4918.70 --> 4920.36]  is available in limited quantities,
[4920.62 --> 4921.24]  so head over to
[4921.24 --> 4922.30]  manscaped.com
[4922.30 --> 4922.66]  slash
[4922.66 --> 4923.14]  WAN
[4923.14 --> 4923.90]  and use code
[4923.90 --> 4924.56]  WANSHOW
[4924.56 --> 4926.14]  to get 20% off
[4926.14 --> 4927.28]  and free shipping.
[4927.68 --> 4929.08]  That actually looks pretty slick.
[4929.50 --> 4929.88]  Yeah.
[4930.62 --> 4931.00]  Not bad.
[4931.28 --> 4932.42]  The team does such a great job
[4932.42 --> 4933.20]  of the footage for these.
[4933.34 --> 4935.00]  Like, a lot of it looks like it,
[4935.04 --> 4935.32]  you know,
[4935.54 --> 4936.86]  was provided by the brand,
[4936.96 --> 4938.50]  except that I recognize, like,
[4939.12 --> 4940.16]  backdrops and stuff
[4940.16 --> 4940.62]  that we have.
[4940.94 --> 4941.50]  This footage?
[4941.60 --> 4942.42]  No, this is our footage.
[4942.90 --> 4943.34]  Oh my god.
[4943.54 --> 4944.22]  Look, someone bumped
[4944.22 --> 4944.94]  the table there.
[4945.02 --> 4945.78]  Like, this is not...
[4945.78 --> 4946.64]  Good job, team.
[4946.98 --> 4947.58]  This is ours?
[4947.76 --> 4949.44]  Oh, yeah, I know that set.
[4949.54 --> 4950.84]  Yeah, that's the screen thing.
[4951.02 --> 4951.84]  Yeah, this is all our footage.
[4951.84 --> 4952.36]  Oh man.
[4952.70 --> 4953.10]  Killing it.
[4953.12 --> 4953.76]  No, that's...
[4953.76 --> 4954.62]  It's over in the corner
[4954.62 --> 4956.10]  where WANSHOW's set used to be
[4956.10 --> 4957.38]  at the very far wall.
[4957.58 --> 4957.78]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4957.78 --> 4957.92]  Yeah.
[4958.30 --> 4959.88]  There's a piece of glass
[4959.88 --> 4961.14]  and then they have
[4961.14 --> 4962.52]  a display behind it.
[4963.00 --> 4963.50]  Yeah, like,
[4963.58 --> 4964.84]  no, the team's great.
[4964.90 --> 4965.52]  Just bring it back there.
[4965.60 --> 4965.74]  Yeah.
[4966.48 --> 4967.80]  This is where Edsel
[4967.80 --> 4968.38]  was experimenting
[4968.38 --> 4969.52]  with some of the UE5,
[4969.58 --> 4971.42]  like, real-time tracking stuff.
[4971.42 --> 4971.94]  Yeah.
[4971.94 --> 4972.02]  Yeah.
[4972.46 --> 4972.66]  Yeah.
[4973.06 --> 4973.20]  Cool.
[4973.40 --> 4974.16]  Anyway, the show's also
[4974.16 --> 4975.22]  brought to you by Ridge.
[4975.36 --> 4975.92]  Look at us.
[4976.12 --> 4977.46]  They're also bringing gold
[4977.46 --> 4978.22]  to you this summer
[4978.22 --> 4978.96]  with their...
[4978.96 --> 4979.56]  Hey, that's us too.
[4979.68 --> 4980.64]  ...massive sweepstakes.
[4980.80 --> 4980.94]  Yep.
[4981.64 --> 4983.02]  Did you see it was Dennis driving?
[4983.54 --> 4984.62]  Uh, yeah.
[4985.02 --> 4985.28]  Yeah.
[4985.32 --> 4985.74]  There he is.
[4985.80 --> 4986.30]  Yeah, it should be.
[4986.80 --> 4989.66]  Um, now you could do...
[4989.66 --> 4991.76]  Now you can drag race
[4991.76 --> 4992.92]  like Dennis...
[4992.92 --> 4993.90]  He's in the passenger seat.
[4993.90 --> 4995.24]  In a gold-plated Cybertruck.
[4995.92 --> 4998.02]  Oh, what am I looking at?
[4998.80 --> 4999.86]  And if being the center
[4999.86 --> 5000.72]  of everyone's attention
[5000.72 --> 5001.52]  isn't your style,
[5001.88 --> 5002.58]  don't worry.
[5003.08 --> 5003.86]  Okay, that happened.
[5004.28 --> 5004.88]  I know.
[5004.88 --> 5005.74]  They were telling us
[5005.74 --> 5006.32]  before the show.
[5006.32 --> 5007.34]  That Sherrod got pulled over, right?
[5007.34 --> 5008.72]  That's actually Sherrod right there.
[5008.88 --> 5009.06]  Yeah.
[5009.46 --> 5009.82]  Yep.
[5010.02 --> 5010.80]  They, um...
[5010.80 --> 5011.30]  Okay, sorry.
[5011.40 --> 5011.92]  We're really...
[5011.92 --> 5013.46]  We're really losing track
[5013.46 --> 5015.36]  of the sponsor talking points here.
[5015.46 --> 5015.78]  Anyway...
[5015.78 --> 5016.40]  The news was so good.
[5017.58 --> 5019.28]  Ridge, massive sweepstakes.
[5019.48 --> 5020.36]  They have other prizes
[5020.36 --> 5021.12]  to choose from.
[5021.52 --> 5022.96]  And yes, that is real footage
[5022.96 --> 5023.96]  of Dennis and Sherrod
[5023.96 --> 5025.40]  on the highway in Salt Lake City.
[5025.96 --> 5026.82]  Anyway, the winner
[5026.82 --> 5027.54]  of the sweepstakes
[5027.54 --> 5028.60]  gets to choose
[5028.60 --> 5030.84]  between a Hennessy Velociraptor,
[5031.26 --> 5033.22]  a gold-plated Cybertruck,
[5033.22 --> 5036.60]  or $100,000 cash.
[5037.36 --> 5037.94]  This says,
[5038.06 --> 5038.86]  what would I pick?
[5039.76 --> 5040.12]  Ooh.
[5040.60 --> 5041.84]  Oh, it cut back to me.
[5041.94 --> 5042.78]  Yeah, that's what it's supposed to do.
[5042.78 --> 5043.56]  What would I pick?
[5044.24 --> 5046.00]  Uh, what would I pick?
[5047.20 --> 5049.72]  I guess I'll take the cash.
[5050.48 --> 5051.22]  What would I do
[5051.22 --> 5052.08]  with a Velociraptor?
[5052.08 --> 5052.48]  Weak.
[5052.84 --> 5053.04]  What?
[5053.30 --> 5053.52]  What?
[5053.56 --> 5054.32]  I love that.
[5054.36 --> 5056.80]  I love that the follow-up sentence
[5056.80 --> 5057.06]  was,
[5057.16 --> 5057.58]  what would I do
[5057.58 --> 5058.72]  with a Velociraptor?
[5058.72 --> 5060.20]  Not the other one.
[5060.22 --> 5060.78]  Well, I mean,
[5060.86 --> 5061.18]  I'm...
[5061.18 --> 5062.48]  Yeah, yeah,
[5062.48 --> 5063.78]  that makes so much sense.
[5063.94 --> 5064.88]  I'm trying to acknowledge
[5064.88 --> 5066.42]  something that's a real option.
[5066.54 --> 5067.32]  I mean, I don't...
[5067.32 --> 5071.20]  What, I would be seen in that?
[5071.84 --> 5072.44]  Like...
[5072.44 --> 5073.12]  You could melt it
[5073.12 --> 5073.94]  into a controller.
[5074.66 --> 5075.18]  Like...
[5075.18 --> 5076.24]  Dude.
[5078.44 --> 5079.60]  I'd be out in the parking lot
[5079.60 --> 5080.36]  scraping it off.
[5080.50 --> 5081.18]  I don't know, man.
[5081.28 --> 5082.12]  I'd be...
[5082.12 --> 5084.16]  I'd be legit.
[5085.28 --> 5086.30]  I'd be legit.
[5086.30 --> 5088.98]  Look, Reg,
[5089.18 --> 5090.60]  hopefully this is compatible
[5090.60 --> 5091.92]  with the sponsor spot
[5091.92 --> 5092.98]  we're doing for you right now.
[5093.04 --> 5093.80]  Here, I'll talk about
[5093.80 --> 5094.64]  your key holder.
[5095.58 --> 5096.30]  There you go.
[5096.38 --> 5096.74]  There you go.
[5096.80 --> 5097.34]  Be distracted.
[5098.58 --> 5099.80]  I would be...
[5099.80 --> 5100.30]  There is...
[5100.30 --> 5101.66]  They do have a Cybertruck
[5101.66 --> 5103.00]  and a Hennessy version
[5103.00 --> 5103.94]  of their things,
[5104.04 --> 5104.62]  their key holder
[5104.62 --> 5105.16]  and their wallet.
[5105.54 --> 5106.78]  I would be embarrassed
[5106.78 --> 5108.42]  to be seen in a Cybertruck.
[5108.84 --> 5109.30]  At all?
[5109.36 --> 5110.08]  Or the gold-plated one?
[5110.68 --> 5110.82]  At all.
[5110.82 --> 5111.64]  Is the gold-plated one
[5111.64 --> 5112.66]  less or more embarrassing?
[5113.52 --> 5114.06]  It's cooler.
[5114.50 --> 5115.50]  So it's less embarrassing?
[5115.54 --> 5116.04]  Yeah, it's cooler.
[5116.04 --> 5116.92]  I think it's...
[5116.92 --> 5118.50]  I think it's so bad
[5118.50 --> 5119.60]  that it comes
[5119.60 --> 5120.94]  all the way back around
[5120.94 --> 5122.98]  to, like, kind of cool.
[5123.14 --> 5124.06]  This might be a weird take.
[5124.16 --> 5124.80]  I actually think
[5124.80 --> 5126.54]  where it says just ridge
[5126.54 --> 5128.32]  on the side of the gold-plated one
[5128.32 --> 5129.54]  actually just looks good.
[5129.98 --> 5131.14]  I rarely like
[5131.14 --> 5132.10]  when you see, like,
[5132.36 --> 5133.98]  just the brand logo on things.
[5134.32 --> 5135.88]  But it's just something
[5135.88 --> 5136.62]  to break up
[5136.62 --> 5137.22]  just the, like,
[5137.36 --> 5138.80]  sea of it's all the same.
[5138.84 --> 5139.26]  Right there?
[5139.46 --> 5139.70]  Yep.
[5139.86 --> 5141.06]  Like, I think it actually looks sharp
[5141.06 --> 5142.52]  having something on it.
[5142.56 --> 5142.84]  Yeah.
[5142.84 --> 5142.92]  Yeah.
[5144.14 --> 5145.62]  That thing looks so
[5145.62 --> 5146.94]  tacky, though.
[5147.04 --> 5147.52]  I just can't.
[5147.52 --> 5149.34]  So if you had to pick a vehicle,
[5149.58 --> 5150.50]  you'd go with the
[5150.50 --> 5151.34]  Hennessey Raptor.
[5152.14 --> 5153.44]  And if you
[5153.44 --> 5154.78]  had to pick something,
[5154.86 --> 5155.64]  you'd go with the cash?
[5156.08 --> 5156.96]  Hold on a second.
[5157.62 --> 5158.14]  Hold on.
[5158.18 --> 5158.54]  Hold on.
[5158.54 --> 5158.98]  Let me think.
[5158.98 --> 5166.52]  Are you looking up
[5166.52 --> 5167.18]  their value
[5167.18 --> 5168.42]  on the resale market?
[5169.00 --> 5169.44]  No.
[5170.50 --> 5171.72]  You have to pay people
[5171.72 --> 5172.36]  to take them away.
[5172.46 --> 5173.54]  I'm just a little curious.
[5174.92 --> 5176.38]  Price of stainless steel per pound.
[5176.60 --> 5177.14]  Oh, dude.
[5177.24 --> 5178.18]  See, I would have
[5178.18 --> 5179.08]  a really hard time
[5179.08 --> 5180.22]  going back to filling up
[5180.22 --> 5181.04]  at the gas station.
[5182.34 --> 5183.94]  I am not into
[5183.94 --> 5185.56]  having a gas vehicle anymore
[5185.56 --> 5186.06]  at all.
[5186.06 --> 5186.74]  Can you go anywhere
[5186.74 --> 5187.48]  in a Cybertruck?
[5187.48 --> 5190.60]  Will it turn on?
[5193.94 --> 5194.76]  Get the truck
[5194.76 --> 5195.60]  and electrify it.
[5195.64 --> 5196.42]  It'd be a fun project.
[5196.66 --> 5198.04]  Oh, no.
[5198.16 --> 5199.28]  If I'm going to have
[5199.28 --> 5200.14]  an electric truck,
[5200.18 --> 5201.14]  I'll just get a Rivian.
[5201.18 --> 5201.60]  Getting a,
[5201.60 --> 5202.60]  getting a, like,
[5202.90 --> 5203.72]  over a thousand
[5203.72 --> 5204.32]  horsepower
[5204.32 --> 5205.54]  Hennessey Velociraptor
[5205.54 --> 5206.60]  and taking the engine
[5206.60 --> 5207.80]  out and electrifying it
[5207.80 --> 5209.98]  would be kind of hilarious.
[5210.14 --> 5210.58]  That would be
[5210.58 --> 5211.48]  completely the rain.
[5211.48 --> 5212.68]  I'd put in my cappuccino.
[5212.68 --> 5216.90]  Dude, I'm sure the engine
[5216.90 --> 5217.48]  for the Hennessey
[5217.48 --> 5218.76]  is bigger than your old car.
[5218.86 --> 5220.08]  Somebody put an LS in it
[5220.08 --> 5221.30]  with twin turbochargers.
[5221.30 --> 5221.40]  No way.
[5221.40 --> 5222.00]  They had to, like,
[5222.04 --> 5223.44]  remove most of the front end
[5223.44 --> 5223.86]  and the hood.
[5224.16 --> 5225.28]  It's 800 horsepower.
[5225.70 --> 5226.12]  Oh, my.
[5226.70 --> 5227.98]  That's actually terrifying.
[5228.38 --> 5229.40]  Death speed run.
[5229.60 --> 5229.84]  Yeah.
[5230.34 --> 5231.36]  That would have,
[5231.52 --> 5232.60]  that would have, like,
[5232.68 --> 5234.88]  the power to weight ratio
[5234.88 --> 5235.96]  of a slot car.
[5236.10 --> 5237.14]  Like, that would be ridiculous.
[5237.14 --> 5237.56]  It's, like,
[5237.62 --> 5238.16]  it's, like,
[5238.20 --> 5239.12]  nearly one-to-one.
[5239.44 --> 5240.64]  That's crazy.
[5240.98 --> 5242.00]  Actually, I think the engine
[5242.00 --> 5243.00]  weighs probably more
[5243.00 --> 5243.22]  than the car.
[5243.22 --> 5244.20]  More than the rest of the car.
[5244.24 --> 5244.92]  Yeah, so it would
[5244.92 --> 5245.66]  affect that slightly.
[5246.20 --> 5247.02]  Top, yeah.
[5247.30 --> 5248.84]  Top Gear 1224 says,
[5249.04 --> 5250.00]  what's more embarrassing,
[5250.10 --> 5251.00]  a gold Cybertruck
[5251.00 --> 5252.40]  or a purple Taycan?
[5252.66 --> 5253.38]  Gold Cybertruck.
[5253.88 --> 5255.84]  Yeah, I really think it is.
[5255.86 --> 5256.42]  Gold Cybertruck.
[5256.46 --> 5257.82]  The Cybertruck is just
[5257.82 --> 5259.22]  brutal, dude.
[5259.94 --> 5261.12]  Um, anywho,
[5261.46 --> 5263.06]  from now until September 16th,
[5263.06 --> 5264.14]  you'll get two entries
[5264.14 --> 5265.38]  for every dollar spent,
[5265.38 --> 5267.78]  or you can get 4X entries
[5267.78 --> 5268.50]  when you purchase
[5268.50 --> 5269.48]  the Cyber Wallet
[5269.48 --> 5272.66]  or Hennessy Specialty Products.
[5272.76 --> 5273.90]  So we've got a couple of their,
[5274.56 --> 5275.74]  oh, we've got a key holder
[5275.74 --> 5276.78]  and a wallet.
[5276.94 --> 5278.42]  Oh, why am I even holding these up?
[5278.44 --> 5279.94]  We've got wonderful footage of them.
[5280.02 --> 5280.34]  There you go.
[5280.38 --> 5281.10]  That's what they look like.
[5281.14 --> 5282.20]  Wow, these look so nice.
[5282.24 --> 5284.32]  So enter now at ridge.com slash when
[5284.32 --> 5285.14]  or using the link
[5285.14 --> 5285.90]  in the video description.
[5286.08 --> 5286.66]  I take the cash.
[5287.12 --> 5288.10]  I'm just going to take the cash.
[5288.26 --> 5288.60]  Take the cash.
[5289.18 --> 5290.38]  Speaking of taking the cash,
[5290.50 --> 5290.94]  I didn't even have to answer.
[5291.08 --> 5292.24]  Our next sponsor is Acronis.
[5292.66 --> 5293.40]  Is your business
[5293.40 --> 5295.22]  paddling rescue waters
[5295.22 --> 5295.78]  the risky,
[5295.94 --> 5296.26]  what?
[5296.46 --> 5297.62]  Paddling the risky waters
[5297.62 --> 5299.04]  of the internet unprotected.
[5299.60 --> 5300.80]  Our sponsor, Acronis,
[5300.84 --> 5301.90]  is here to save you
[5301.90 --> 5303.06]  from scary sharks.
[5304.18 --> 5304.66]  Wow.
[5306.46 --> 5307.46]  My goodness.
[5308.68 --> 5310.02]  Acronis doesn't just act
[5310.02 --> 5310.66]  like a shield,
[5310.86 --> 5312.40]  but they also simplify
[5312.40 --> 5313.68]  your IT management.
[5314.32 --> 5315.06]  Instead of juggling
[5315.06 --> 5315.88]  multiple vendors
[5315.88 --> 5317.00]  and spending thousands,
[5317.26 --> 5318.08]  Acronis Cyber Protect
[5318.08 --> 5318.86]  brings security,
[5319.00 --> 5319.20]  backup,
[5319.28 --> 5320.12]  and disaster recovery
[5320.12 --> 5321.08]  together in one
[5321.08 --> 5322.22]  easy-to-use platform.
[5322.58 --> 5323.14]  But they don't just
[5323.14 --> 5323.90]  back up your files.
[5323.90 --> 5325.04]  They also offer
[5325.04 --> 5325.74]  built-in features
[5325.74 --> 5326.56]  like patch management,
[5326.72 --> 5327.26]  device control,
[5327.36 --> 5328.46]  and more.
[5328.98 --> 5330.04]  And with AI-powered protection,
[5330.16 --> 5330.82]  you can get the most
[5330.82 --> 5331.42]  secure backup
[5331.42 --> 5332.52]  to keep your data safe.
[5332.80 --> 5333.86]  Plus, with one-click
[5333.86 --> 5334.80]  self-service recovery,
[5335.08 --> 5335.92]  anyone can quickly
[5335.92 --> 5336.84]  fix IT issues
[5336.84 --> 5337.76]  without relying
[5337.76 --> 5338.58]  on central IT.
[5339.54 --> 5340.24]  You can manage
[5340.24 --> 5341.08]  remote endpoints,
[5341.42 --> 5342.52]  run vulnerability assessments,
[5342.74 --> 5343.92]  and handle patch management
[5343.92 --> 5345.12]  all from a single platform.
[5345.18 --> 5345.46]  Hey, wait,
[5345.58 --> 5346.80]  that was a redundant
[5346.80 --> 5347.46]  talking point.
[5347.60 --> 5348.10]  Dang it, you guys.
[5348.54 --> 5348.90]  Anyway,
[5349.02 --> 5349.60]  protect your business
[5349.60 --> 5350.10]  from data loss
[5350.10 --> 5350.62]  and cyber threats
[5350.62 --> 5351.68]  with Acronis Cyber Protect
[5351.68 --> 5353.10]  by heading over to
[5353.10 --> 5355.70]  go.acronis.com
[5355.70 --> 5356.70]  slash WANshow
[5356.70 --> 5357.46]  or the link
[5357.46 --> 5358.66]  in the video description.
[5361.44 --> 5361.92]  Okay.
[5362.30 --> 5363.18]  We're supposed to do
[5363.18 --> 5364.14]  a few merch messages.
[5364.34 --> 5364.62]  Dan,
[5364.74 --> 5365.52]  go ahead
[5365.52 --> 5367.28]  and hit me.
[5367.44 --> 5367.72]  Sure.
[5368.14 --> 5368.44]  Hey,
[5368.56 --> 5369.68]  Linus and the talent,
[5369.94 --> 5371.24]  I'd be curious
[5371.24 --> 5372.54]  to your thoughts
[5372.54 --> 5373.16]  on...
[5373.16 --> 5373.34]  Yeah,
[5373.44 --> 5374.08]  that's nice.
[5374.08 --> 5377.00]  No,
[5377.06 --> 5377.64]  I'm not responding
[5377.64 --> 5378.54]  to this merch message.
[5378.74 --> 5378.88]  No,
[5378.94 --> 5379.06]  no,
[5379.08 --> 5379.20]  no,
[5379.20 --> 5379.26]  no,
[5379.26 --> 5379.36]  no,
[5379.36 --> 5379.96]  I don't like it.
[5380.14 --> 5380.28]  No,
[5380.34 --> 5381.60]  that's good for you.
[5381.80 --> 5381.96]  No.
[5383.08 --> 5383.38]  Okay,
[5383.46 --> 5383.74]  whatever.
[5384.42 --> 5386.08]  Talent is a derogatory...
[5386.08 --> 5386.92]  I take it that way.
[5386.94 --> 5387.68]  It is not.
[5387.86 --> 5389.46]  I don't think he means it to be,
[5389.54 --> 5390.24]  but right now...
[5390.24 --> 5390.48]  No,
[5390.58 --> 5392.24]  talent is not derogatory.
[5392.48 --> 5393.24]  It's a...
[5393.24 --> 5394.80]  It removes the person
[5394.80 --> 5396.62]  from the statement
[5396.62 --> 5398.30]  where you're just like
[5398.30 --> 5399.10]  an object.
[5399.38 --> 5399.54]  Whoa,
[5399.58 --> 5399.78]  whoa,
[5399.78 --> 5399.94]  whoa,
[5399.94 --> 5400.04]  whoa,
[5400.04 --> 5401.90]  hold on a second.
[5402.14 --> 5403.36]  I...
[5403.36 --> 5403.86]  What?
[5403.98 --> 5404.24]  Really?
[5404.46 --> 5405.44]  I've always thought it's...
[5405.44 --> 5406.44]  I think they meant it
[5406.44 --> 5407.52]  as derogatory,
[5407.64 --> 5408.32]  but it's like,
[5408.42 --> 5408.54]  no,
[5408.64 --> 5409.46]  that means that you're
[5409.46 --> 5410.12]  the real person
[5410.12 --> 5411.30]  and we're just like
[5411.30 --> 5412.94]  accessories to make your show.
[5413.90 --> 5414.34]  What?
[5416.70 --> 5417.14]  Oh,
[5417.24 --> 5417.54]  man.
[5417.68 --> 5418.20]  See...
[5418.20 --> 5419.10]  Because I've called you guys
[5419.10 --> 5420.20]  the talent before
[5420.20 --> 5421.44]  because from my perspective,
[5421.68 --> 5421.96]  like,
[5422.28 --> 5423.40]  I'm producing the show
[5423.40 --> 5424.42]  and you're just kind of like
[5424.42 --> 5427.00]  part of what makes the show,
[5427.10 --> 5427.26]  right?
[5427.26 --> 5428.12]  So you remove the,
[5428.32 --> 5428.40]  like,
[5428.50 --> 5429.24]  human aspect
[5429.24 --> 5429.94]  that your people...
[5429.94 --> 5430.44]  He's the human,
[5430.58 --> 5430.88]  we're the...
[5430.88 --> 5431.00]  No,
[5431.08 --> 5431.12]  no,
[5431.12 --> 5431.22]  no,
[5431.28 --> 5432.98]  I'm not a person either.
[5432.98 --> 5433.28]  Like,
[5433.34 --> 5433.76]  the show,
[5433.84 --> 5434.90]  it becomes the entity,
[5435.34 --> 5435.60]  right?
[5435.68 --> 5435.92]  Oh.
[5436.54 --> 5438.10]  And you are just kind of
[5438.10 --> 5439.10]  a part of the show,
[5439.18 --> 5439.32]  like,
[5439.40 --> 5439.92]  set dressing,
[5440.08 --> 5440.28]  right?
[5440.50 --> 5441.10]  I...
[5441.10 --> 5441.82]  It's a whole thing.
[5442.06 --> 5443.14]  Most of chat
[5443.14 --> 5445.48]  does not appear to be
[5445.48 --> 5446.90]  aligned with that,
[5447.10 --> 5447.30]  Dan.
[5447.60 --> 5447.80]  No,
[5447.84 --> 5447.92]  no,
[5447.92 --> 5448.04]  no,
[5448.04 --> 5448.64]  it's definitely
[5448.64 --> 5450.88]  supposed to be...
[5450.88 --> 5451.16]  No,
[5451.24 --> 5451.88]  I don't understand.
[5452.06 --> 5452.50]  I don't...
[5452.50 --> 5453.40]  Because I thought...
[5453.40 --> 5454.18]  Because...
[5454.18 --> 5454.58]  Hold on.
[5454.72 --> 5455.92]  Because a lot of people
[5455.92 --> 5456.72]  have said,
[5456.86 --> 5456.94]  hey,
[5457.02 --> 5458.14]  Dan and the talent before,
[5458.24 --> 5459.18]  but this is the first time
[5459.18 --> 5459.38]  that,
[5459.44 --> 5459.64]  like,
[5459.86 --> 5460.80]  Linus has been...
[5460.80 --> 5460.92]  No,
[5460.96 --> 5461.04]  no,
[5461.04 --> 5462.12]  they're calling me untalented.
[5462.26 --> 5463.58]  It's definitely a sick burn.
[5464.34 --> 5464.70]  But like...
[5464.70 --> 5465.56]  But a lot of the other
[5465.56 --> 5466.86]  merch messages that use
[5466.86 --> 5468.22]  Dan and the talent in them,
[5468.70 --> 5468.90]  right?
[5468.94 --> 5469.12]  Yeah,
[5469.18 --> 5469.78]  because...
[5469.78 --> 5472.74]  Because the on-screen players
[5472.74 --> 5473.56]  are the talent.
[5473.56 --> 5474.50]  Often referred to as the talent.
[5474.56 --> 5474.76]  Yeah,
[5474.84 --> 5475.02]  like,
[5475.08 --> 5475.48]  that's just...
[5475.48 --> 5476.84]  I think that's just an industry term.
[5476.90 --> 5477.62]  I don't think it's meant
[5477.62 --> 5478.46]  to be derogatory.
[5479.14 --> 5479.54]  Like,
[5479.58 --> 5481.16]  if you say...
[5481.16 --> 5481.34]  And...
[5481.34 --> 5481.50]  Yeah,
[5481.50 --> 5482.66]  but that's derogatory to you
[5482.66 --> 5483.08]  because you're,
[5483.18 --> 5483.32]  like,
[5483.40 --> 5484.78]  the people as well.
[5484.78 --> 5485.24]  If you say,
[5485.32 --> 5486.00]  and director,
[5487.12 --> 5487.32]  then,
[5487.40 --> 5487.68]  like,
[5488.56 --> 5489.92]  I don't think that's disrespectful.
[5490.10 --> 5490.96]  I think that just describes
[5490.96 --> 5491.94]  their role in the production.
[5492.58 --> 5494.00]  Am I off base here?
[5494.42 --> 5494.94]  I don't know.
[5495.06 --> 5496.18]  I think we're all a bit off base.
[5496.36 --> 5496.98]  I didn't realize
[5496.98 --> 5498.56]  that this would be so polarizing
[5498.56 --> 5499.26]  so immediately.
[5499.72 --> 5499.92]  Oh.
[5500.36 --> 5500.94]  All right.
[5501.16 --> 5502.28]  I've never loved the turn,
[5502.40 --> 5502.72]  personally,
[5502.84 --> 5503.16]  but I,
[5503.36 --> 5503.68]  honestly,
[5503.80 --> 5505.18]  my amount of cares is
[5505.18 --> 5507.16]  quite low.
[5507.36 --> 5507.64]  Yeah,
[5507.74 --> 5507.88]  because,
[5508.00 --> 5508.10]  like,
[5508.20 --> 5509.06]  I've never loved the turn.
[5509.42 --> 5509.70]  Oh,
[5509.80 --> 5510.18]  all right.
[5511.22 --> 5511.40]  Well,
[5511.40 --> 5511.96]  for what it's worth,
[5512.04 --> 5512.22]  Luke?
[5512.36 --> 5513.36]  Host makes more sense.
[5513.36 --> 5514.26]  I think you're talented.
[5514.84 --> 5515.24]  Well,
[5515.28 --> 5516.04]  not everyone's a host,
[5516.14 --> 5516.32]  though.
[5516.54 --> 5517.38]  Here's a question
[5517.38 --> 5518.96]  about the word talent
[5518.96 --> 5520.00]  because I just looked it up
[5520.00 --> 5520.70]  and I'm still not,
[5521.18 --> 5522.58]  I've taken it,
[5522.62 --> 5523.54]  and maybe I'm just taking it wrong.
[5523.82 --> 5524.60]  I've taken it as,
[5524.82 --> 5524.86]  like,
[5524.92 --> 5526.34]  you have an innate skill.
[5526.46 --> 5527.00]  It's not something
[5527.00 --> 5527.78]  that you honed,
[5528.78 --> 5529.98]  but you were just
[5529.98 --> 5531.12]  naturally good at something.
[5531.28 --> 5531.44]  Dude,
[5531.48 --> 5532.88]  you're applying video game logic.
[5534.72 --> 5535.60]  I get to be,
[5535.62 --> 5536.68]  That sounds very likely.
[5536.98 --> 5538.06]  Do I get to be right
[5538.06 --> 5539.12]  on WAN Show for a change?
[5539.12 --> 5540.02]  Are you guys actually
[5540.02 --> 5540.92]  siding with me
[5540.92 --> 5541.58]  for a change?
[5541.96 --> 5542.12]  Yeah,
[5542.12 --> 5543.44]  I think Linus is right,
[5543.56 --> 5543.66]  too,
[5543.72 --> 5543.94]  yeah.
[5544.26 --> 5544.60]  Sure.
[5544.86 --> 5545.44]  It's all,
[5545.64 --> 5546.58]  it's a bit of a thing.
[5546.68 --> 5546.82]  Yeah,
[5546.88 --> 5548.04]  talent is used for anyone
[5548.04 --> 5548.48]  on screen,
[5548.62 --> 5549.34]  not just the host.
[5549.96 --> 5550.10]  Yeah.
[5550.60 --> 5550.82]  Yeah,
[5550.82 --> 5550.94]  yeah,
[5550.94 --> 5551.04]  yeah,
[5551.04 --> 5551.72]  they're calling me
[5551.72 --> 5552.18]  untalented,
[5552.32 --> 5552.76]  but they're just
[5552.76 --> 5553.40]  meaning on me.
[5553.52 --> 5553.74]  But no.
[5554.38 --> 5554.74]  Originally,
[5554.94 --> 5555.48]  the reason why
[5555.48 --> 5556.26]  I didn't originally
[5556.26 --> 5557.18]  like it is because
[5557.18 --> 5558.48]  it seems derogatory
[5558.48 --> 5559.32]  to everybody else.
[5559.32 --> 5561.36]  Oh,
[5561.58 --> 5562.96]  that was my original reason
[5562.96 --> 5563.28]  for not working.
[5563.28 --> 5563.30]  Oh,
[5563.30 --> 5564.72]  like referring to the person
[5564.72 --> 5565.96]  who is like the star
[5565.96 --> 5566.50]  or whatever.
[5566.50 --> 5566.90]  Those are the only people
[5566.90 --> 5567.62]  that are any good.
[5567.64 --> 5568.80]  As the people with talent.
[5568.90 --> 5569.22]  Yes.
[5570.68 --> 5571.08]  Oh,
[5571.20 --> 5571.58]  I see.
[5571.58 --> 5572.06]  That's like,
[5572.24 --> 5573.02]  when I originally
[5573.02 --> 5573.80]  didn't like the word,
[5573.92 --> 5574.62]  that was my reason.
[5574.62 --> 5574.76]  Yeah,
[5574.78 --> 5575.36]  but I don't think
[5575.36 --> 5576.12]  like a director
[5576.12 --> 5577.84]  implies that they're
[5577.84 --> 5578.96]  not a talented one.
[5579.02 --> 5579.62]  I think it's just,
[5579.70 --> 5579.80]  yeah,
[5579.84 --> 5579.98]  no,
[5580.04 --> 5580.80]  talent is just,
[5580.90 --> 5581.10]  yeah.
[5581.26 --> 5581.88]  But the directors
[5581.88 --> 5583.46]  tend to be the ones
[5583.46 --> 5584.02]  with the money.
[5584.62 --> 5584.84]  No,
[5584.98 --> 5585.88]  that's a producer.
[5586.88 --> 5587.24]  Yeah,
[5587.30 --> 5587.42]  no,
[5587.52 --> 5587.88]  director.
[5587.90 --> 5589.20]  The director's not also?
[5589.74 --> 5590.58]  If you're good,
[5590.70 --> 5591.02]  sure.
[5591.22 --> 5592.64]  But if you're a good talent,
[5592.72 --> 5593.92]  then you also have money.
[5594.00 --> 5595.08]  And if you're a good,
[5596.90 --> 5597.18]  actually,
[5597.26 --> 5598.04]  as far as I can tell,
[5598.18 --> 5599.28]  most everybody else
[5599.28 --> 5600.12]  ends up not making
[5600.12 --> 5600.64]  a ton of money,
[5600.72 --> 5600.88]  but.
[5601.50 --> 5601.86]  Yeah,
[5601.86 --> 5602.60]  then you're an extra.
[5602.78 --> 5603.54]  You're not even talent.
[5604.16 --> 5604.28]  Well,
[5604.30 --> 5604.42]  no,
[5604.44 --> 5604.54]  no,
[5604.54 --> 5604.82]  I just,
[5604.94 --> 5605.12]  I was,
[5605.26 --> 5605.58]  well,
[5605.58 --> 5606.30]  I was trying to come up,
[5606.38 --> 5606.54]  like,
[5606.58 --> 5606.76]  I mean,
[5606.78 --> 5607.46]  I guess if you're like.
[5607.56 --> 5607.70]  See,
[5607.74 --> 5608.10]  but like,
[5608.14 --> 5608.28]  yeah,
[5608.34 --> 5609.70]  why is there a distinction there?
[5609.84 --> 5609.98]  No,
[5610.04 --> 5610.90]  an extra is still talent.
[5611.70 --> 5612.00]  Are they?
[5612.12 --> 5612.52]  100%.
[5612.52 --> 5613.44]  100%.
[5613.44 --> 5614.20]  A lesser talent.
[5615.72 --> 5616.08]  Although,
[5616.24 --> 5618.68]  often extras are given no lines,
[5618.78 --> 5622.04]  so they have like no real effect
[5622.04 --> 5622.66]  on like the production.
[5622.66 --> 5622.84]  Wait,
[5622.90 --> 5623.42]  Luke's literally
[5623.42 --> 5624.34]  looking this up.
[5624.66 --> 5625.40]  I'm going out of here.
[5627.62 --> 5628.38]  Background extras,
[5628.56 --> 5629.28]  supporting artist,
[5629.40 --> 5629.58]  junior,
[5629.68 --> 5630.22]  oh my goodness.
[5630.56 --> 5632.14]  Have we custodianized
[5632.14 --> 5634.26]  the extras?
[5634.86 --> 5635.12]  No,
[5635.32 --> 5636.26]  that's right there.
[5637.02 --> 5637.18]  No,
[5637.18 --> 5637.30]  no,
[5637.30 --> 5637.38]  no,
[5637.38 --> 5637.42]  no,
[5637.42 --> 5639.42]  I mean that we don't call them extras anymore.
[5640.08 --> 5640.48]  Oh,
[5640.68 --> 5641.04]  oh,
[5641.38 --> 5642.88]  now they're junior artists.
[5643.22 --> 5643.36]  Oh,
[5643.48 --> 5643.76]  that's,
[5644.02 --> 5645.94]  that's something that I didn't know about.
[5645.94 --> 5648.56]  That atmosphere sounds so much worse
[5648.56 --> 5649.66]  to me personally.
[5649.80 --> 5650.10]  Oh yeah,
[5650.12 --> 5650.64]  that's awful.
[5650.98 --> 5651.12]  Whoa,
[5651.58 --> 5652.48]  that's such a downgrade.
[5652.48 --> 5652.92]  Excuse me,
[5652.98 --> 5653.76]  what's your job?
[5654.36 --> 5657.24]  Could the atmosphere go stand next to the potted plant?
[5657.96 --> 5658.08]  Like,
[5658.08 --> 5660.58]  you've got some bad atmosphere.
[5660.64 --> 5661.12]  Gross.
[5661.26 --> 5661.96]  Oh man.
[5663.04 --> 5663.44]  Yeah,
[5663.60 --> 5666.10]  this is not something I've thought about a lot
[5666.10 --> 5666.98]  or cared about much.
[5667.08 --> 5668.38]  I turn into gas.
[5668.38 --> 5669.38]  I mean,
[5669.38 --> 5671.28]  I mean,
[5671.28 --> 5671.94]  if you could do that,
[5671.96 --> 5673.60]  you might be one of the main characters in the show,
[5673.68 --> 5673.94]  actually.
[5674.02 --> 5675.52]  I may be slowly turning into gas.
[5675.60 --> 5675.80]  I mean,
[5675.80 --> 5677.10]  we've seen plenty of evidence of it.
[5678.78 --> 5679.80]  Those poor chairs.
[5682.62 --> 5682.98]  Okay,
[5683.04 --> 5685.60]  so when we frame it as Linus and the talent,
[5685.82 --> 5686.74]  what was the question?
[5687.34 --> 5687.68]  I don't know.
[5687.74 --> 5688.60]  I want to finish this.
[5688.82 --> 5688.84]  Yeah,
[5688.84 --> 5689.32]  what does that mean?
[5689.32 --> 5691.46]  So Linus and the talent means that I'm untalented.
[5692.22 --> 5692.28]  Oh,
[5692.52 --> 5692.94]  no.
[5693.28 --> 5693.56]  Yeah,
[5693.92 --> 5694.90]  that's what they meant.
[5695.30 --> 5696.30]  It was a sick burn.
[5696.48 --> 5696.64]  They were,
[5696.64 --> 5696.98]  they were,
[5696.98 --> 5699.62]  but we've just established that talent is a,
[5699.62 --> 5701.46]  a role in a production.
[5701.64 --> 5701.78]  Yeah.
[5701.84 --> 5703.66]  You guys are both talent because they're boom.
[5703.76 --> 5704.04]  Talent,
[5704.24 --> 5704.70]  untalent,
[5705.08 --> 5705.34]  talent,
[5705.60 --> 5706.04]  untalent,
[5706.18 --> 5706.44]  talent,
[5706.62 --> 5707.10]  untalent.
[5707.64 --> 5708.04]  Yeah,
[5708.06 --> 5709.60]  but you still have a job here.
[5709.80 --> 5710.04]  Well,
[5710.08 --> 5710.28]  yeah,
[5710.28 --> 5712.76]  but they were just memeing because they were pretending to
[5712.76 --> 5716.34]  misunderstand the term talent as having talent.
[5716.54 --> 5718.86]  And they were referring to me as being untalented.
[5719.36 --> 5721.12]  I think that's why I don't like the word.
[5721.80 --> 5721.92]  But,
[5721.92 --> 5724.86]  no,
[5725.00 --> 5725.38]  cause it,
[5725.48 --> 5726.60]  cause in my mind,
[5726.60 --> 5727.70]  you're the one with the name.
[5727.70 --> 5730.98]  So you get to be a person and then we're just accessories to
[5730.98 --> 5731.54]  your production.
[5731.78 --> 5731.98]  No,
[5732.06 --> 5733.22]  because like I've,
[5733.36 --> 5733.48]  okay.
[5733.58 --> 5736.10]  Like they definitely intended it to imply you are untalented,
[5736.40 --> 5739.52]  but I've gone on the third party sets where I am like the
[5739.52 --> 5740.38]  main person.
[5740.52 --> 5740.92]  Yeah.
[5741.00 --> 5743.12]  And I get referred to as talent.
[5743.34 --> 5743.56]  Yes.
[5743.60 --> 5744.68]  Or like on the contract,
[5744.68 --> 5745.50]  it'll just be like,
[5745.80 --> 5745.92]  blah,
[5745.96 --> 5746.06]  blah,
[5746.10 --> 5746.24]  blah,
[5746.28 --> 5746.44]  blah,
[5746.48 --> 5746.74]  blah,
[5746.96 --> 5749.14]  heretofore referred to as talent.
[5749.66 --> 5750.04]  Like it's,
[5750.12 --> 5751.24]  it just means a performer.
[5751.24 --> 5752.32]  That's all it means.
[5752.40 --> 5752.80]  Exactly.
[5753.12 --> 5753.44]  Right.
[5753.44 --> 5754.82]  I mean,
[5754.86 --> 5756.82]  my favorite term is watering the talent.
[5758.40 --> 5758.76]  Right.
[5758.82 --> 5759.76]  I fill up your water bottles.
[5759.86 --> 5760.70]  I used to give the,
[5760.70 --> 5762.24]  the bands on stage their water.
[5762.32 --> 5763.12]  Do you want warm water?
[5763.22 --> 5764.04]  Do you want cold water?
[5764.10 --> 5765.16]  It would be best for your throat.
[5765.16 --> 5765.52]  Right.
[5765.90 --> 5766.30]  Uh,
[5766.30 --> 5767.30]  watering the talent.
[5767.38 --> 5767.52]  It's,
[5767.58 --> 5767.96]  it's fun.
[5767.96 --> 5769.96]  I don't know.
[5769.96 --> 5770.80]  From now on,
[5770.84 --> 5772.24]  I want to be referred to as shortened.
[5773.62 --> 5774.48]  I'm not tall.
[5774.98 --> 5777.72]  So I actually see the whole time as kind of discriminatory.
[5779.20 --> 5779.60]  Okay.
[5779.94 --> 5780.38]  Atmosphere.
[5783.38 --> 5783.82]  Kingant.
[5785.58 --> 5786.02]  Uh,
[5786.10 --> 5786.46]  all right.
[5786.50 --> 5787.18]  So what are we talking?
[5787.26 --> 5787.78]  What was the,
[5788.04 --> 5789.68]  you wouldn't let me get there.
[5789.80 --> 5790.76]  I'd be curious,
[5790.76 --> 5791.26]  uh,
[5791.26 --> 5795.24]  to your thoughts on why tech and gaming cafes haven't taken off in North America.
[5795.24 --> 5798.90]  It seems like it'd be a slam dunk with gaming becoming super mainstream and popular.
[5798.90 --> 5805.32]  Now they don't seem to be doing as far as my terrible observations can account for.
[5805.42 --> 5808.82]  I don't think they're doing as well in Asian countries either these days.
[5809.06 --> 5809.50]  Oh,
[5809.54 --> 5809.72]  really?
[5809.86 --> 5810.06]  I mean,
[5810.16 --> 5810.78]  I don't know.
[5810.94 --> 5813.20]  Take because mobile gaming is taking off.
[5813.28 --> 5813.80]  That's why.
[5814.26 --> 5814.46]  Oh,
[5814.52 --> 5817.20]  but are you talking about like a themed cafe though?
[5817.28 --> 5820.98]  Or are you talking about like an eye cafe with like gaming computers in it?
[5820.98 --> 5822.04]  Is that what they're referencing?
[5822.04 --> 5823.46]  I think they're talking about themed cafes.
[5823.68 --> 5824.08]  Oh,
[5824.08 --> 5824.62]  my bad.
[5824.62 --> 5829.76]  There was that bar downtown that had like gaming themed cocktails and stuff.
[5830.10 --> 5831.04]  Was that what it was called?
[5831.26 --> 5831.38]  Storm crew.
[5831.48 --> 5831.58]  Yeah.
[5831.88 --> 5832.08]  Yeah.
[5832.08 --> 5834.92]  But didn't they shut down during COVID or something?
[5834.92 --> 5836.98]  I think they at least shut down one location.
[5837.50 --> 5837.94]  Uh,
[5838.46 --> 5839.24]  looking it up.
[5839.92 --> 5840.22]  Yeah.
[5841.06 --> 5841.76]  I guess.
[5841.98 --> 5842.46]  Permanently closed.
[5842.92 --> 5843.12]  Yeah.
[5843.18 --> 5845.14]  I guess the question for me is,
[5845.22 --> 5845.54]  you know,
[5845.58 --> 5846.24]  what is it?
[5846.50 --> 5846.94]  Man,
[5847.08 --> 5847.72]  this is tough.
[5847.74 --> 5850.48]  Cause I have to confess that when we went to Japan,
[5850.48 --> 5852.02]  like went to the Pokemon cafe,
[5852.18 --> 5852.70]  for example,
[5852.70 --> 5857.62]  I was super unimpressed by the whole deal.
[5857.62 --> 5858.02]  Uh,
[5858.02 --> 5860.12]  the food was not just not very good.
[5860.12 --> 5862.64]  Like it was functionally inedible.
[5862.78 --> 5863.20]  A lot of it.
[5863.26 --> 5863.64]  Sorry.
[5863.84 --> 5864.24]  In Japan.
[5865.00 --> 5865.44]  Um,
[5866.36 --> 5866.66]  it was,
[5866.82 --> 5867.44]  it was packed.
[5867.52 --> 5869.24]  Like business was booming,
[5869.24 --> 5870.34]  but,
[5870.42 --> 5870.72]  uh,
[5870.72 --> 5871.92]  it was just kind of sucky.
[5871.92 --> 5878.02]  And I just kind of wonder if the expectations for a themed restaurant are totally different here,
[5878.02 --> 5882.12]  because I wouldn't see a business like that succeeding very well here.
[5882.26 --> 5884.78]  Your food still has to be good.
[5885.04 --> 5886.34]  Like I've never been,
[5886.48 --> 5889.02]  but my understanding is Vancouver is actually insanely high.
[5889.02 --> 5891.76]  My understanding is even like Hooters has decent food,
[5892.10 --> 5892.28]  though.
[5892.32 --> 5893.10]  I've never been there.
[5893.46 --> 5893.86]  Um,
[5893.98 --> 5894.74]  that's what I've,
[5894.78 --> 5895.36]  that's what I've heard.
[5895.42 --> 5896.28]  Don't quote me on that,
[5896.34 --> 5903.84]  but I don't think it's good enough to have a theme with a themed restaurant with just like disgusting food in it here.
[5904.68 --> 5905.08]  Um,
[5905.34 --> 5905.54]  yeah,
[5905.54 --> 5906.62]  apparently the wings are great.
[5906.82 --> 5907.40]  Says chat.
[5908.28 --> 5908.68]  Um,
[5909.42 --> 5909.64]  yeah,
[5909.72 --> 5910.18]  there you go.
[5910.44 --> 5911.42]  So they used to,
[5911.48 --> 5912.36]  to know about nowadays.
[5913.30 --> 5913.70]  Um,
[5913.82 --> 5914.52]  the wings are good.
[5914.60 --> 5914.76]  Yeah.
[5914.76 --> 5915.86]  So I,
[5916.50 --> 5917.56]  maybe that's part of it.
[5917.56 --> 5921.68]  And I think that one of the challenges is that in order to have like a gaming themed cafe,
[5921.98 --> 5925.06]  it either is like sort of generic,
[5925.06 --> 5927.82]  in which case I don't know if it would appeal to people as much,
[5927.82 --> 5931.46]  or you'd be paying licensing fees because it's commercial use of the IP.
[5932.22 --> 5932.50]  Um,
[5932.50 --> 5934.00]  and I think that affects the quality.
[5934.00 --> 5938.32]  So like the Pokemon cafe seems to be actually run by the Pokemon company.
[5938.70 --> 5943.60]  And so the kind of margin that these,
[5943.60 --> 5946.88]  that these licensed brands expect,
[5946.88 --> 5947.70]  um,
[5947.70 --> 5952.40]  has a direct impact on the quality of the product in a lot of cases has been my experience.
[5954.02 --> 5954.62]  Um,
[5955.06 --> 5958.04]  with that said,
[5958.06 --> 5958.42]  I mean,
[5958.90 --> 5960.40]  I think we've talked about,
[5960.40 --> 5960.86]  you know,
[5960.92 --> 5962.26]  restaurant ideas before,
[5962.26 --> 5962.56]  or,
[5962.64 --> 5966.84]  and like Yvonne and I have talked about lots and lots of business ideas over the years.
[5966.84 --> 5967.14]  Like,
[5967.44 --> 5967.72]  uh,
[5967.72 --> 5971.28]  one idea that I had a while back that I thought would be super cool.
[5971.28 --> 5973.66]  Are you going?
[5973.80 --> 5973.94]  Oh,
[5973.94 --> 5974.20]  okay.
[5974.64 --> 5975.08]  Um,
[5975.48 --> 5977.84]  is I wanted to create like,
[5977.84 --> 5978.38]  um,
[5978.94 --> 5980.02]  like toddler land.
[5980.64 --> 5992.32]  And so the idea was that it would be like an attraction for adults where you have this warehouse that you decorate the outside to look like a normal house,
[5992.32 --> 5993.64]  but everything is scaled up.
[5993.64 --> 5999.82]  you walk through a giant front door and you experience this entire environment.
[6000.92 --> 6005.02]  Like what it would be like to be thigh high to an adult.
[6005.18 --> 6011.82]  So there's like giant stairs and you can like sit and eat a meal at a giant table with giant cutlery.
[6011.82 --> 6012.28]  And like,
[6012.36 --> 6012.76]  I don't know.
[6012.80 --> 6013.84]  It'd just be like a weird,
[6014.00 --> 6014.78]  it'd be such a,
[6014.78 --> 6015.16]  like a,
[6015.16 --> 6015.44]  you know,
[6015.46 --> 6016.50]  an Instagramable.
[6016.94 --> 6017.18]  Yeah.
[6017.30 --> 6018.12]  Like thing to do.
[6018.14 --> 6022.52]  A big spoon on like suspension crane wires that like flies food towards you.
[6022.68 --> 6022.92]  Uh,
[6022.96 --> 6023.10]  well,
[6023.10 --> 6023.72]  not even that,
[6023.80 --> 6024.06]  not even,
[6024.06 --> 6024.22]  no,
[6024.22 --> 6024.34]  no,
[6024.34 --> 6025.36]  I hadn't gotten that far.
[6025.36 --> 6026.44]  Cause that would be a lot of work.
[6027.34 --> 6029.78]  Mostly it was just going to be creating a giant environment.
[6029.78 --> 6033.30]  It was kind of inspired by these upside down houses that you can go to.
[6033.44 --> 6033.56]  Yeah.
[6033.84 --> 6034.24]  Um,
[6034.24 --> 6034.96]  but just like,
[6034.96 --> 6036.60]  have you ever been to dark table?
[6036.78 --> 6037.18]  I have.
[6037.44 --> 6037.70]  Yeah.
[6037.86 --> 6040.28]  Like I like those types of experiences personally.
[6040.40 --> 6041.84]  Would the meals also be giant portions?
[6041.96 --> 6042.14]  Yeah.
[6042.20 --> 6042.62]  I mean,
[6042.68 --> 6042.98]  sure.
[6043.06 --> 6043.22]  Yeah.
[6043.22 --> 6043.80]  I'd be down.
[6044.38 --> 6044.78]  Um,
[6045.30 --> 6046.06]  I like you,
[6046.06 --> 6048.74]  you source produce that's like oversized and stuff.
[6048.74 --> 6049.04]  And like,
[6049.12 --> 6049.60]  I don't know.
[6049.62 --> 6050.30]  I don't know.
[6050.36 --> 6050.54]  Just,
[6050.78 --> 6051.02]  just,
[6051.06 --> 6052.20]  it's just like wacky ideas,
[6052.28 --> 6053.10]  but I've,
[6053.20 --> 6054.82]  I've always had this kind of,
[6054.82 --> 6055.82]  uh,
[6056.52 --> 6058.70]  brain worm idea that like,
[6058.78 --> 6060.68]  if I don't want to,
[6061.36 --> 6064.14]  if I finally just want to chill,
[6064.14 --> 6066.22]  I would like go,
[6066.60 --> 6066.92]  you know,
[6067.14 --> 6072.56]  move further out than where we are now to a smaller area and then open just like,
[6072.56 --> 6073.06]  uh,
[6073.06 --> 6078.52]  a very small corner cafe diner thing like Luke in Gilmore girls.
[6078.84 --> 6080.24]  And just like do that.
[6080.88 --> 6081.36]  Interesting.
[6081.50 --> 6082.50]  I'm just going to chill now.
[6082.54 --> 6089.22]  And I would have to have enough money that it wouldn't have to be super profitable or maybe even profitable at all.
[6089.22 --> 6091.66]  Because like those types of businesses are often,
[6091.80 --> 6093.14]  you'd want to buy the property outright.
[6093.38 --> 6093.54]  Yep.
[6093.54 --> 6096.60]  Maybe find one that's commercial zoned on the bottom and then live above it.
[6096.60 --> 6098.76]  Like he does in Gilmore girls.
[6099.16 --> 6099.52]  Exactly.
[6099.68 --> 6100.82]  Are you a Gilmore girls fan?
[6100.98 --> 6101.38]  Oh yeah.
[6101.66 --> 6101.96]  Really?
[6102.14 --> 6102.32]  Yep.
[6102.48 --> 6103.50]  I did not know that.
[6103.60 --> 6103.78]  Yep.
[6104.42 --> 6104.72]  Huh.
[6104.98 --> 6105.20]  Yep.
[6105.82 --> 6106.22]  Hold on.
[6106.28 --> 6106.56]  Okay.
[6107.04 --> 6107.84]  Let's play a game.
[6108.54 --> 6108.64]  Um,
[6110.68 --> 6110.88]  I mean,
[6110.88 --> 6111.78]  I haven't watched it in a long time,
[6111.84 --> 6112.16]  but yeah.
[6112.48 --> 6112.70]  Well,
[6112.70 --> 6112.84]  yeah,
[6112.84 --> 6114.12]  it hasn't been airing for a long time.
[6114.12 --> 6114.38]  are you,
[6114.42 --> 6114.98]  are you like,
[6114.98 --> 6115.68]  uh,
[6115.82 --> 6116.48]  quizzing me?
[6116.50 --> 6116.68]  No,
[6116.68 --> 6116.76]  no,
[6116.76 --> 6116.78]  no,
[6116.78 --> 6116.88]  no,
[6116.88 --> 6117.10]  no,
[6117.10 --> 6117.16]  no,
[6117.16 --> 6117.80]  I'm not going to quiz you.
[6117.90 --> 6119.24]  I've only seen bits and pieces.
[6119.24 --> 6121.62]  I'm just trying to figure out the game.
[6121.68 --> 6124.92]  I want to play is I want to try to guess what it is that you like about it.
[6125.14 --> 6125.46]  Okay.
[6125.46 --> 6129.42]  So I think you probably like the smart snappy dialogue.
[6129.70 --> 6129.94]  Yes.
[6130.10 --> 6130.78]  The one liners.
[6130.92 --> 6131.32]  Absolutely.
[6131.68 --> 6132.12]  Um,
[6132.46 --> 6133.16]  very much so.
[6133.26 --> 6134.16]  That's a huge part of the draw.
[6134.20 --> 6134.90]  It's not the only drop.
[6135.12 --> 6135.42]  Yeah.
[6136.06 --> 6137.14]  That's why I started there.
[6137.20 --> 6137.90]  That's why I started there.
[6138.54 --> 6138.94]  Um,
[6139.16 --> 6145.96]  I think you like probably the relatively realistic and believable character interactions.
[6146.84 --> 6149.92]  It's very dramatic as a show,
[6150.02 --> 6151.90]  but it doesn't get into like,
[6151.90 --> 6155.28]  I cannot believe that any human would behave this way territory.
[6155.28 --> 6156.56]  I think for the most part,
[6156.56 --> 6159.90]  I think that's kind of all you need.
[6160.10 --> 6160.12]  The,
[6160.24 --> 6160.38]  the,
[6160.52 --> 6161.28]  it is very dramatic,
[6161.28 --> 6162.52]  but there's never usually like,
[6163.12 --> 6163.36]  like,
[6163.36 --> 6166.04]  I don't think there's any like murders.
[6166.46 --> 6166.86]  Yeah.
[6166.86 --> 6167.36]  It's not like,
[6167.46 --> 6168.08]  Oh my,
[6168.24 --> 6168.44]  uh,
[6168.44 --> 6169.04]  how could that?
[6169.14 --> 6169.84]  Oh my goodness.
[6170.02 --> 6170.66]  It's like,
[6170.72 --> 6171.06]  uh,
[6171.06 --> 6171.68]  it's pretty grounded.
[6172.24 --> 6172.64]  Yeah.
[6176.40 --> 6177.00]  What else?
[6178.62 --> 6178.90]  Uh,
[6178.90 --> 6179.22]  for me?
[6179.28 --> 6179.46]  Yeah.
[6179.52 --> 6180.04]  I'm answering now.
[6180.38 --> 6180.74]  Um,
[6180.86 --> 6181.08]  yeah,
[6181.08 --> 6182.88]  I found some of the characters pretty relatable.
[6182.88 --> 6187.96]  I found the mistakes that the characters go through or like the choices that I didn't agree
[6187.96 --> 6190.24]  with to feel very human.
[6190.48 --> 6191.64]  If that makes sense.
[6191.72 --> 6195.32]  Like I might not have agreed with the choice that this one person did,
[6195.40 --> 6197.06]  but yeah,
[6197.06 --> 6201.98]  I could see them doing it or I could see like one of my friends like doing this.
[6202.20 --> 6204.22]  I found Rory insufferable often.
[6204.32 --> 6204.48]  Yeah.
[6204.54 --> 6205.48]  I just like it.
[6205.56 --> 6206.62]  Like he's not my favorite character.
[6206.72 --> 6211.06]  Sometimes there's characters that I dislike enough as people that I just kind of have a hard
[6211.06 --> 6211.92]  time watching the show.
[6212.00 --> 6214.58]  And I just found her extremely difficult to be around.
[6214.86 --> 6215.48]  In my opinion,
[6215.80 --> 6215.92]  the,
[6216.08 --> 6217.48]  and someone in chat said this,
[6217.52 --> 6218.60]  but I'm not actually just copy,
[6218.76 --> 6219.32]  copying them.
[6219.40 --> 6220.42]  It's also my opinion.
[6220.54 --> 6222.64]  The show is about Lorelei and Luke.
[6223.16 --> 6223.42]  Right.
[6223.54 --> 6225.98]  And I didn't like Luke just cause he shares my name.
[6226.96 --> 6227.70]  You're not that shallow.
[6228.06 --> 6228.24]  No,
[6228.28 --> 6228.68]  not quite.
[6228.76 --> 6229.18]  Cause I,
[6229.22 --> 6229.46]  I,
[6229.56 --> 6230.56]  I definitely,
[6231.30 --> 6231.40]  I,
[6231.48 --> 6232.36]  and his characters,
[6232.36 --> 6234.26]  I root for any character named Linus.
[6234.82 --> 6236.48]  I get so few W's.
[6236.74 --> 6236.90]  Luke.
[6239.24 --> 6240.98]  There isn't that many Luke's either,
[6241.12 --> 6242.96]  but the ones that I do have are pretty cool.
[6243.04 --> 6244.06]  You literally have an apostle.
[6244.28 --> 6245.12]  I don't want to hear about it.
[6245.24 --> 6246.56]  That's I have that.
[6247.50 --> 6248.50]  Skywalker's pretty sick.
[6248.78 --> 6249.00]  Yeah.
[6249.10 --> 6250.36]  Luke from Gilmore Girls is pretty.
[6250.62 --> 6250.74]  Yeah.
[6250.74 --> 6251.14]  Yeah.
[6251.26 --> 6251.58]  Yeah.
[6251.74 --> 6252.06]  Yeah.
[6252.22 --> 6252.58]  Yeah.
[6252.58 --> 6253.32]  I don't want to hear about it.
[6253.34 --> 6254.24]  We've got it going on.
[6255.62 --> 6255.98]  Yeah.
[6256.02 --> 6256.28]  I don't know.
[6256.30 --> 6256.56]  It's just,
[6256.62 --> 6257.50]  it's just a good show.
[6257.50 --> 6258.00]  I like,
[6259.04 --> 6259.32]  I,
[6259.38 --> 6263.42]  I find some people might not even like this,
[6263.42 --> 6265.20]  but I don't care.
[6265.32 --> 6268.10]  I find a lot of modern media is like,
[6268.18 --> 6268.44]  Oh,
[6268.70 --> 6270.78]  like it's all about the,
[6270.78 --> 6272.12]  the grays.
[6272.14 --> 6272.42]  Like,
[6272.48 --> 6272.72]  you know,
[6272.74 --> 6273.76]  the evil guys,
[6273.76 --> 6274.62]  you should probably like,
[6274.62 --> 6275.54]  like them a lot.
[6275.54 --> 6277.80]  And the good guys are like actually really bad.
[6277.98 --> 6281.30]  And we're going to make sure that you come out of this learning
[6281.30 --> 6283.06]  something and having moral questions.
[6283.06 --> 6283.40]  And like,
[6283.58 --> 6285.52]  sometimes I just want to watch something and be like,
[6285.70 --> 6285.90]  cool.
[6286.36 --> 6286.48]  Yeah.
[6286.48 --> 6287.74]  The Nazis lost.
[6287.90 --> 6288.12]  Yeah.
[6288.12 --> 6288.74]  And that's good.
[6288.82 --> 6289.14]  Good.
[6289.40 --> 6289.62]  Like,
[6289.66 --> 6290.98]  I just leave it alone.
[6291.12 --> 6291.28]  I,
[6291.38 --> 6292.10]  I don't,
[6292.20 --> 6292.56]  anyways.
[6292.78 --> 6293.24]  Um,
[6293.60 --> 6294.52]  and there's,
[6294.60 --> 6297.68]  there's another form of content that aligns with that whole concept,
[6297.68 --> 6302.68]  which is just where it's like relatively casual and you actually just want to relax
[6302.68 --> 6303.94]  and watch something.
[6304.30 --> 6307.76]  And I think Gilmore girls falls in line with that.
[6307.82 --> 6308.28]  There's another,
[6308.28 --> 6308.58]  like,
[6309.24 --> 6314.92]  there's a Canadian show where it follows a family that owns a,
[6314.92 --> 6315.48]  uh,
[6315.48 --> 6316.20]  uh,
[6316.32 --> 6317.88]  it's like a convenience store or something.
[6317.88 --> 6318.06]  Oh,
[6318.12 --> 6318.62]  Kim's convenience.
[6318.80 --> 6319.26]  Kim's convenience.
[6319.50 --> 6319.62]  Yeah.
[6319.62 --> 6320.46]  I like Kim's convenience.
[6320.70 --> 6320.92]  Okay.
[6321.32 --> 6321.56]  For,
[6321.70 --> 6323.34]  I think similar,
[6323.52 --> 6325.50]  but not the same reasons why I like Gilmore girls.
[6326.78 --> 6328.24]  I thought Gilmore girls was better,
[6328.40 --> 6330.94]  but I still thought Kim's convenience was pretty good.
[6331.66 --> 6331.86]  Yeah.
[6331.92 --> 6333.36]  It wasn't something like Kim's convenience.
[6333.36 --> 6335.90]  It wasn't something I was going to sit down and watch dedicated.
[6336.08 --> 6336.36]  Sure.
[6336.44 --> 6337.30]  But if it was on,
[6337.56 --> 6337.76]  yeah,
[6337.76 --> 6338.06]  it's cool.
[6338.06 --> 6338.20]  Yeah.
[6338.20 --> 6338.38]  Sure.
[6338.58 --> 6338.78]  Yeah.
[6339.02 --> 6339.18]  Cool.
[6339.18 --> 6340.86]  And like Gilmore girls was somewhat similar.
[6341.06 --> 6346.76]  I used to watch Gilmore girls cause the computer at my parents house was in the family room where
[6346.76 --> 6347.44]  the TV was.
[6347.44 --> 6350.06]  So like my mom would be watching good more girls or whatever.
[6350.06 --> 6356.12]  And it was good enough that I would like headphones off and like actually pay attention to it while I'm doing other things.
[6356.58 --> 6357.60]  Slice of life shows.
[6357.68 --> 6357.86]  Yeah.
[6358.04 --> 6358.16]  Oh,
[6358.16 --> 6358.54]  chill.
[6358.94 --> 6359.56]  Slice of life shows.
[6359.56 --> 6360.38]  Or you can go,
[6360.50 --> 6365.60]  you can go on the dramatic level and have more intense topics,
[6365.60 --> 6367.66]  but I often do like it when it's like,
[6367.96 --> 6368.06]  yeah,
[6368.08 --> 6369.76]  the Nazis lost and the Nazis are bad.
[6370.08 --> 6370.66]  There there's,
[6370.78 --> 6372.34]  there's a time and place for the,
[6372.44 --> 6375.58]  like the morally gray learn things,
[6375.68 --> 6376.78]  question things content,
[6376.78 --> 6377.64]  but it's just,
[6377.72 --> 6379.50]  it's so constant these days.
[6379.50 --> 6380.02]  It's just like,
[6380.06 --> 6380.32]  man,
[6380.48 --> 6380.92]  relax.
[6381.06 --> 6381.56]  I don't,
[6382.14 --> 6383.52]  I actually just want to chill.
[6383.66 --> 6385.74]  The world has enough of this already.
[6386.06 --> 6386.50]  Um,
[6386.50 --> 6388.72]  have you looked at politics at all?
[6389.04 --> 6389.38]  Um,
[6389.56 --> 6391.52]  I don't need more of that personally.
[6393.52 --> 6394.48]  My goodness.
[6395.00 --> 6395.42]  All right.
[6395.52 --> 6396.70]  I forget what the question was,
[6396.78 --> 6397.56]  but go ahead,
[6397.62 --> 6397.78]  Dan,
[6397.84 --> 6398.88]  hit us with another merch message.
[6399.00 --> 6399.24]  Uh,
[6399.60 --> 6399.92]  yeah,
[6399.98 --> 6400.24]  sure.
[6400.52 --> 6400.68]  Uh,
[6400.86 --> 6401.20]  yeah.
[6401.32 --> 6402.46]  What even is this show about?
[6402.62 --> 6403.18]  How did we get,
[6403.24 --> 6404.12]  was that a merch message?
[6404.26 --> 6404.74]  I think so.
[6404.84 --> 6404.98]  Yeah,
[6404.98 --> 6406.82]  that was a merch message for the last 15 minutes.
[6407.08 --> 6407.22]  Hey,
[6407.30 --> 6407.88]  WAN.DLO,
[6408.20 --> 6413.34]  with the PS5 Pro comes my continued sorrow that storage is soldered.
[6413.66 --> 6419.04]  Thoughts about the idea that PS4 hardware could outlive PS5 hardware since high failure components
[6419.04 --> 6419.92]  can be replaced.
[6421.50 --> 6423.16]  That's an interesting question.
[6423.16 --> 6423.60]  Um,
[6424.12 --> 6425.24]  and to be clear,
[6425.46 --> 6427.44]  I want to acknowledge that the,
[6427.44 --> 6429.80]  the PlayStation 5 has,
[6429.90 --> 6431.72]  has some non-soldered storage.
[6431.72 --> 6432.66]  It does have,
[6432.66 --> 6433.00]  uh,
[6433.00 --> 6436.52]  a storage bay that you can install an M.2 SSD in,
[6436.60 --> 6436.74]  which,
[6437.30 --> 6438.18]  in my opinion,
[6438.18 --> 6440.66]  was such a pro consumer,
[6441.08 --> 6441.92]  um,
[6442.30 --> 6442.56]  like,
[6442.68 --> 6444.62]  healthy move that I,
[6444.64 --> 6445.24]  I can't,
[6445.64 --> 6450.76]  I can't say enough how unexpected it was for me from Sony of all,
[6450.84 --> 6451.60]  of all players.
[6451.60 --> 6452.52]  Um,
[6452.80 --> 6453.36]  but,
[6453.36 --> 6455.16]  with that said,
[6455.34 --> 6459.94]  what Eric points out is that the boot SSD is very much soldered,
[6460.12 --> 6463.44]  and you cannot boot off of that M.2 drive.
[6464.32 --> 6464.76]  Um,
[6466.34 --> 6473.32]  could PS4 hardware outlive PS5 hardware because you can just replace the drive anytime you want?
[6474.00 --> 6474.32]  Man,
[6474.40 --> 6476.06]  I'd love to think that,
[6476.06 --> 6476.62]  you know,
[6476.62 --> 6480.84]  Sony could issue an update or something that would allow you to move all of the,
[6480.96 --> 6484.36]  all of the boot partition,
[6484.62 --> 6484.96]  like any,
[6485.02 --> 6485.28]  any,
[6485.58 --> 6488.92]  any necessary OS files over to the M.2 drive.
[6489.80 --> 6491.52]  I kind of don't think they would,
[6492.28 --> 6492.78]  but then I,
[6492.78 --> 6495.16]  I didn't think they would have an M.2 slot in the first place.
[6495.16 --> 6495.52]  So,
[6495.68 --> 6496.30]  I don't know,
[6496.36 --> 6496.86]  maybe they would,
[6497.04 --> 6498.20]  but remember Sony,
[6498.96 --> 6500.12]  Sony acknowledges,
[6500.22 --> 6506.20]  I think that the performance of the M.2 slot is not as high as the soldered SSD,
[6506.62 --> 6511.04]  but then I don't think we've seen a game yet where it's made a difference.
[6511.48 --> 6511.58]  I,
[6511.64 --> 6517.30]  I think really my answer to all of this is that it should be terrifying for anyone who's into consoles,
[6517.84 --> 6518.36]  um,
[6518.92 --> 6520.68]  that it's basically just PlayStation right now.
[6520.80 --> 6522.20]  That is horrible.
[6522.94 --> 6523.74]  It's very bad.
[6523.96 --> 6524.88]  Does it matter?
[6525.16 --> 6525.60]  Absolutely.
[6526.04 --> 6526.18]  Well,
[6526.18 --> 6526.46]  hold on,
[6526.52 --> 6526.80]  hold on.
[6526.90 --> 6527.12]  Let me,
[6527.18 --> 6527.42]  hold on.
[6527.42 --> 6527.82]  Let me finish.
[6528.18 --> 6531.46]  Does it matter if every Sony exclusives just going to come to PC anyway?
[6531.68 --> 6532.26]  I'll let you finish,
[6532.36 --> 6532.52]  but.
[6533.72 --> 6534.46]  I did finish.
[6534.84 --> 6535.20]  Um,
[6535.20 --> 6536.46]  no,
[6536.52 --> 6537.58]  I'm doing the Kanye reference.
[6537.78 --> 6538.64]  I know the reference,
[6538.74 --> 6539.70]  but I'm already done talking.
[6539.82 --> 6540.04]  All right.
[6540.08 --> 6540.30]  All right.
[6540.98 --> 6541.38]  Uh,
[6541.96 --> 6543.52]  I think it does.
[6543.62 --> 6546.76]  I think it matters for console people,
[6546.90 --> 6548.78]  but like PC people,
[6548.86 --> 6549.68]  I don't think it makes a difference.
[6549.78 --> 6552.26]  What's a console person even going to be in a few years?
[6552.30 --> 6552.50]  I mean,
[6552.52 --> 6553.44]  Microsoft has,
[6553.50 --> 6555.66]  has publicly acknowledged Steam OS.
[6555.66 --> 6555.98]  Now,
[6556.12 --> 6560.16]  I think we're going to get a Windows console OS for handheld,
[6560.16 --> 6564.88]  at which point we're going to get a Windows console OS for desktop because it's basically
[6564.88 --> 6565.52]  the same thing.
[6565.56 --> 6565.90]  If we get that,
[6566.02 --> 6567.08]  then I think it's fine,
[6568.14 --> 6569.78]  but I've heard no whispers of that.
[6569.90 --> 6570.52]  And honestly,
[6570.70 --> 6573.64]  PC on a TV right now is not a great experience.
[6573.94 --> 6575.74]  It's not a console like experience.
[6575.84 --> 6576.26]  It's not great.
[6576.44 --> 6576.84]  You can,
[6576.84 --> 6580.22]  you can configure Steam to launch on startup and launch a big picture.
[6580.90 --> 6581.52]  It's not.
[6581.90 --> 6582.64]  You're a hundred percent right.
[6582.64 --> 6583.50]  Like there's,
[6583.62 --> 6584.04]  there is,
[6584.52 --> 6585.90]  I don't care,
[6586.04 --> 6590.70]  but I understand the reasons why certain people like consoles and it's,
[6590.84 --> 6596.56]  they're getting less solid because consoles are getting more annoying to use.
[6596.68 --> 6597.42]  I think over time,
[6597.46 --> 6599.24]  which is weird and sucks.
[6599.36 --> 6600.54]  But back in the day,
[6600.54 --> 6601.44]  the argument was like,
[6601.46 --> 6601.70]  you know,
[6601.76 --> 6603.02]  with my N64,
[6603.78 --> 6604.56]  put thing in,
[6604.68 --> 6605.38]  turn thing on.
[6605.46 --> 6606.42]  I am playing game.
[6606.52 --> 6606.70]  Yeah,
[6606.76 --> 6607.42]  that's it.
[6607.56 --> 6607.80]  Yeah.
[6608.04 --> 6609.44]  Which is awesome.
[6609.54 --> 6610.24]  It was so funny.
[6610.24 --> 6613.72]  I saw one comment that had a fair number of upvotes that was just like,
[6614.96 --> 6617.24]  there's like charging more for just like,
[6617.58 --> 6619.86]  it's like slightly better and it's more expensive.
[6620.20 --> 6621.06]  And I was just like,
[6621.88 --> 6625.76]  just like on PCs.
[6626.54 --> 6627.02]  Sorry,
[6627.18 --> 6627.48]  man,
[6627.54 --> 6628.60]  but welcome to the party.
[6628.86 --> 6629.06]  Yeah,
[6629.12 --> 6629.58]  exactly.
[6630.06 --> 6631.64]  I apologize that you're here.
[6631.90 --> 6632.22]  Yeah.
[6633.56 --> 6634.08]  Yeah.
[6634.26 --> 6634.76]  And,
[6635.04 --> 6636.20]  but yeah,
[6636.26 --> 6636.38]  no,
[6636.42 --> 6636.60]  they're,
[6636.60 --> 6638.00]  they're so PC like you're right.
[6638.30 --> 6638.52]  Yeah.
[6639.00 --> 6639.40]  Which,
[6639.40 --> 6639.72]  which,
[6639.72 --> 6640.58]  unfortunately,
[6641.14 --> 6645.30]  they seem to be inheriting a lot of the negative aspects of PCs and not
[6645.30 --> 6647.20]  inheriting as many of the good ones.
[6647.52 --> 6648.02]  Patches.
[6648.08 --> 6649.98]  While PCs are actually gaining.
[6650.46 --> 6650.72]  Yeah.
[6650.94 --> 6651.64]  And consoles,
[6651.64 --> 6655.36]  consoles are retaining a lot of the negativity that they've had,
[6655.44 --> 6657.76]  like paying for access to online multiplayer.
[6657.96 --> 6660.12]  Like that is mind blowing.
[6660.22 --> 6666.10]  And you look at the way that Microsoft has just brazenly changed the way that
[6666.10 --> 6670.08]  Game Pass works so that it kind of sucks on Xbox compared to on a PC.
[6670.58 --> 6670.90]  Yeah.
[6671.96 --> 6672.36]  Effectively,
[6672.44 --> 6672.80]  I've just said,
[6672.86 --> 6673.14]  I don't know,
[6673.20 --> 6673.58]  get good,
[6673.64 --> 6674.28]  buy a PC.
[6674.40 --> 6676.22]  Then if you want to get a good deal on Game Pass,
[6676.32 --> 6676.78]  what?
[6676.78 --> 6677.06]  What?
[6678.34 --> 6678.74]  Yeah.
[6678.74 --> 6679.06]  It's,
[6679.06 --> 6679.44]  it's,
[6679.44 --> 6683.66]  I think a somewhat uncomfortable time to be a console gamer,
[6683.88 --> 6686.16]  especially if you're an Xbox console gamer,
[6686.30 --> 6688.00]  but even if you're a PlayStation console gamer,
[6688.22 --> 6689.12]  it's just all,
[6689.12 --> 6690.62]  all little uncomfortable right now.
[6690.70 --> 6692.22]  And if you're someone who's like a,
[6692.22 --> 6692.58]  you know,
[6692.62 --> 6694.14]  a TV gamer,
[6694.28 --> 6695.26]  maybe let's call it that.
[6695.32 --> 6695.60]  Yeah.
[6695.74 --> 6696.00]  Then,
[6696.08 --> 6696.28]  yeah,
[6696.28 --> 6700.22]  it's just awkward because Windows isn't an amazing solution.
[6700.64 --> 6701.70]  You can do it,
[6701.92 --> 6702.44]  but it's,
[6702.66 --> 6702.94]  yeah,
[6702.94 --> 6704.76]  it's not great.
[6705.26 --> 6707.12]  As long as you need a keyboard and a mouse,
[6708.06 --> 6708.58]  um,
[6709.98 --> 6712.46]  couch solutions for that are just kind of awkward and really bulky.
[6713.46 --> 6715.68]  And I don't think there's any getting away from that,
[6715.76 --> 6716.12]  to be honest.
[6716.22 --> 6716.32]  No,
[6716.36 --> 6719.26]  but there's so many games that you can play on PC with a controller now.
[6719.30 --> 6720.10]  Like it's kind of,
[6720.24 --> 6721.00]  it does help a lot.
[6722.00 --> 6722.40]  Essentially.
[6722.72 --> 6723.38]  It helps a lot.
[6724.10 --> 6724.80]  Speaking of which,
[6725.32 --> 6727.50]  speaking of games that you could play with a controller,
[6728.62 --> 6729.18]  I have a,
[6729.18 --> 6731.90]  I have a hot take that the internet is not going to like me for.
[6732.24 --> 6732.60]  You,
[6732.60 --> 6735.34]  you played more of final fantasy six and it's not that good.
[6736.24 --> 6736.56]  No,
[6736.62 --> 6737.36]  I did play more of it.
[6737.42 --> 6737.94]  It's very good.
[6738.60 --> 6738.90]  Nice.
[6738.96 --> 6740.00]  I'm still very happy with that game.
[6740.10 --> 6741.22]  It's going to take me a long time to beat it,
[6741.28 --> 6741.42]  but,
[6741.42 --> 6742.18]  um,
[6742.28 --> 6742.60]  on a,
[6742.74 --> 6743.44]  on a,
[6743.46 --> 6743.70]  I got,
[6743.76 --> 6746.62]  I got pushed with a very strong recommendation to at least try a game.
[6747.14 --> 6747.46]  Oh,
[6747.56 --> 6748.18]  so I did.
[6748.44 --> 6748.92]  What game?
[6750.08 --> 6750.74]  And so far,
[6750.76 --> 6751.86]  it's really good.
[6753.46 --> 6754.16]  What game?
[6754.34 --> 6755.38]  Star Wars outlaws.
[6756.48 --> 6756.80]  Oh,
[6757.18 --> 6759.10]  it's really good so far.
[6759.16 --> 6760.32]  I thought people said it was okay.
[6760.72 --> 6761.56]  I thought people said it was terrible.
[6761.70 --> 6761.84]  Wait,
[6761.84 --> 6761.98]  no,
[6762.02 --> 6763.06]  I'm thinking of Jedi survivor.
[6763.52 --> 6763.78]  Yeah.
[6763.98 --> 6764.40]  Uh,
[6764.40 --> 6764.64]  okay.
[6764.64 --> 6765.06]  So sorry.
[6765.12 --> 6765.44]  Is that,
[6765.54 --> 6766.94]  is that a hot take outlaws?
[6767.08 --> 6768.12]  Do people hate outlaws?
[6768.30 --> 6769.32]  It's cause it's from,
[6769.32 --> 6771.06]  it's cause it's from Ubisoft,
[6771.24 --> 6772.00]  which is,
[6772.10 --> 6775.32]  I think why people don't like it after playing the game.
[6775.38 --> 6776.74]  It has one of the coolest,
[6776.92 --> 6778.18]  I'm going to say most innovative.
[6778.18 --> 6778.98]  And then someone's going to be like,
[6778.98 --> 6779.10]  Oh,
[6779.10 --> 6781.24]  well,
[6781.24 --> 6782.44]  they lifted it from this indie game.
[6782.44 --> 6783.00]  I'm sorry.
[6783.00 --> 6783.56]  I didn't know.
[6783.56 --> 6785.10]  The story seems really good.
[6785.10 --> 6785.62]  So far,
[6785.74 --> 6787.22]  the characters seem cool.
[6787.70 --> 6788.18]  Um,
[6788.26 --> 6788.62]  the,
[6788.62 --> 6791.30]  the design of the environments are fantastic.
[6791.30 --> 6793.24]  Like the city that I'm in is awesome.
[6793.88 --> 6794.32]  Um,
[6794.38 --> 6796.88]  there's some things that like leave things to be desired.
[6796.88 --> 6797.52]  I think the,
[6797.52 --> 6800.38]  the speeder driving mechanics are not great.
[6800.48 --> 6801.44]  I think the general,
[6801.60 --> 6805.20]  that you can't shoot and also drive at the same time or something.
[6805.34 --> 6805.98]  Kind of weird.
[6806.28 --> 6806.52]  Yeah.
[6806.62 --> 6807.02]  Um,
[6807.02 --> 6809.68]  you can use a ability to do like,
[6810.58 --> 6812.34]  like a takedown or whatever it is.
[6812.34 --> 6813.58]  Like an ultimate kind of,
[6813.62 --> 6813.88]  yeah,
[6814.02 --> 6815.20]  but it has to like charge up.
[6815.20 --> 6816.94]  That is definitely like awkward.
[6817.32 --> 6817.48]  Yeah.
[6817.64 --> 6818.08]  Um,
[6819.16 --> 6821.84]  but it also has barely impacted my gameplay at all.
[6821.92 --> 6822.48]  So I don't care.
[6822.54 --> 6823.30]  I haven't played that much.
[6823.36 --> 6825.14]  So maybe it becomes more of a thing the more you play.
[6825.24 --> 6825.66]  I don't know.
[6825.66 --> 6826.98]  Um,
[6827.16 --> 6830.22]  but so far having played it,
[6831.18 --> 6832.66]  it's,
[6833.18 --> 6838.70]  I think most people are saying it's bad because Ubisoft is bad.
[6838.78 --> 6840.26]  Not because the game is bad.
[6840.92 --> 6842.90]  I think the game is pretty good.
[6842.94 --> 6846.66]  How many hours are you in counting it in hours is already becoming disingenuous.
[6847.66 --> 6848.14]  Um,
[6848.26 --> 6849.08]  I'm not that far in.
[6849.54 --> 6850.72]  I'm through the,
[6850.72 --> 6852.82]  the intro to the game area.
[6852.92 --> 6855.52]  And then I've spent probably like 20 minutes after that.
[6855.52 --> 6856.06]  And then that's it.
[6856.16 --> 6857.28]  So I'm not that far into the game,
[6857.32 --> 6859.14]  but like the sound is great.
[6860.02 --> 6861.90]  The story already has me quite interested.
[6862.08 --> 6864.98]  The lock picking mechanic is so cool that there's a,
[6865.06 --> 6866.86]  there's a thing that constantly turns.
[6866.98 --> 6867.32]  Yeah.
[6867.32 --> 6868.60]  And then in a rhythm,
[6868.60 --> 6871.26]  it like shows the pattern that you have to do.
[6871.34 --> 6874.22]  And then as it comes back around making like ticking noises,
[6874.22 --> 6879.16]  you have to like almost preemptively press along with the rhythm and then it unlocks for you,
[6879.16 --> 6881.72]  which is like actually kind of fun and satisfying.
[6881.72 --> 6888.66]  You'd like feel like you did well when you did it instead of a lot of other lock picking mechanics and games where it's just like tedium.
[6888.88 --> 6889.22]  Right.
[6889.22 --> 6889.66]  Um,
[6890.30 --> 6890.74]  I don't know.
[6890.84 --> 6891.14]  I've,
[6891.22 --> 6893.02]  I just can't with star Wars anymore,
[6893.02 --> 6893.34]  dude.
[6893.86 --> 6894.44]  I just,
[6894.56 --> 6894.66]  I,
[6894.74 --> 6894.86]  Oh,
[6894.88 --> 6895.30]  I'm just,
[6895.44 --> 6895.94]  I'm just,
[6895.94 --> 6898.20]  I'm completely ignoring that it's star Wars.
[6898.30 --> 6898.46]  Oh,
[6898.52 --> 6898.68]  okay.
[6898.68 --> 6899.18]  That makes sense.
[6899.30 --> 6899.40]  Um,
[6899.40 --> 6901.46]  I haven't seen a lightsaber in the game yet.
[6901.60 --> 6902.68]  I don't think it matters.
[6903.06 --> 6904.28]  You're like outer rim,
[6904.52 --> 6907.92]  whatever space outlaw person.
[6908.52 --> 6908.92]  Okay.
[6908.92 --> 6913.22]  No part of the game so far has been in like star Wars has not been important.
[6914.38 --> 6915.74]  Even slightly so far.
[6916.62 --> 6918.62]  I don't think we've ran into a single character.
[6918.62 --> 6921.44]  That's like a major character from the mainline series.
[6921.80 --> 6922.24]  Um,
[6922.36 --> 6924.24]  personally yet there's no lightsabers.
[6924.30 --> 6924.42]  No,
[6924.48 --> 6926.56]  there's no even reference to any of it so far.
[6927.06 --> 6928.74]  There are technically storm troopers.
[6928.84 --> 6930.72]  I think I've seen like four and they didn't matter.
[6932.68 --> 6933.08]  Yeah.
[6935.54 --> 6935.94]  Okay.
[6935.94 --> 6938.98]  And the last one I think I've got for you here.
[6939.28 --> 6939.42]  Oh,
[6939.48 --> 6941.36]  Linus Duke and Dan question for Luke.
[6941.80 --> 6947.04]  I currently am desperately searching for a job in a market that seems almost dead for
[6947.04 --> 6947.60]  developers.
[6947.90 --> 6950.34]  What do you think of jobs that ghost applicants?
[6950.68 --> 6951.68]  We've done it by accident.
[6952.16 --> 6952.54]  Um,
[6952.78 --> 6957.76]  I am sincerely sorry for anyone that we ever didn't get back to.
[6958.14 --> 6958.54]  Um,
[6959.10 --> 6960.44]  it was not our intent.
[6961.36 --> 6963.26]  Sometimes I end up doing it and I,
[6963.36 --> 6965.80]  I don't also like he's saying intend to,
[6965.80 --> 6967.78]  but for some of the positions here,
[6967.78 --> 6971.56]  we just get a insane amount of applicants and it's a little bit hard to keep track.
[6972.20 --> 6972.64]  Um,
[6972.70 --> 6974.40]  you can keep bumping to get a response,
[6974.40 --> 6975.84]  but in general,
[6975.84 --> 6976.40]  uh,
[6976.40 --> 6978.52]  you're recognizing that it's a tough market out there.
[6978.84 --> 6980.28]  Don't just apply to one place.
[6981.06 --> 6981.46]  Yeah.
[6981.56 --> 6982.16]  And don't wait.
[6983.34 --> 6983.82]  Um,
[6983.92 --> 6984.06]  dude,
[6984.10 --> 6985.60]  I had not one care of yourself first,
[6985.72 --> 6987.82]  but two articles in my newsfeed,
[6987.82 --> 6989.80]  like before even refreshing that were like,
[6989.80 --> 6993.86]  I've applied to 900 jobs and like,
[6993.86 --> 6997.86]  haven't gotten an interview and I've applied to 400 jobs and haven't gotten an interview.
[6997.86 --> 7001.78]  It seems like it's getting hungry out there.
[7001.78 --> 7004.28]  A big part of the problem is.
[7004.34 --> 7004.62]  Oh,
[7004.80 --> 7005.04]  Oh,
[7005.04 --> 7005.46]  Oh,
[7005.46 --> 7005.76]  Oh,
[7005.76 --> 7006.06]  Oh,
[7006.06 --> 7007.06]  spicy taking coming.
[7007.28 --> 7007.44]  No.
[7007.74 --> 7007.90]  Oh,
[7007.92 --> 7008.20]  okay.
[7008.70 --> 7010.08]  AI written applications.
[7011.14 --> 7011.62]  Oh,
[7011.84 --> 7012.88]  AI written cover letters,
[7013.00 --> 7013.90]  AI written applications.
[7014.02 --> 7014.94]  Application rates.
[7014.94 --> 7017.36]  So good at jobs are going through the roof,
[7017.38 --> 7024.92]  not in line with unemployment because the barrier to apply to places is lower than ever,
[7024.92 --> 7027.12]  especially when they ask for cover letters and stuff,
[7027.12 --> 7028.28]  because people just aren't writing them.
[7028.92 --> 7029.40]  Interesting.
[7029.40 --> 7036.98]  And then the average quality of people's writing is going up because a lot of AI writing is better than the average person's writing.
[7037.38 --> 7037.80]  Uh huh.
[7038.68 --> 7038.98]  Yeah.
[7042.20 --> 7043.44]  Now tell me this,
[7043.44 --> 7050.10]  if you're using AI to write your application and then they're using AI to sort it.
[7050.84 --> 7051.08]  Yep.
[7051.76 --> 7053.28]  This is a whole thing.
[7053.46 --> 7053.84]  How are,
[7054.00 --> 7056.96]  how are the humans actually involved in this transaction?
[7057.20 --> 7063.62]  I really think we're going to have to find some way to change the dynamic of how hiring works.
[7063.74 --> 7065.06]  I don't know what the answer is,
[7065.18 --> 7065.40]  but.
[7066.42 --> 7068.18]  We go back to everything's in person.
[7069.04 --> 7071.98]  You walk into a store and hand in a resume like your dad told you to.
[7071.98 --> 7072.14]  Yeah.
[7072.14 --> 7074.24]  We meet potential employees at,
[7074.24 --> 7074.70]  uh,
[7075.00 --> 7075.76]  at like,
[7075.84 --> 7076.20]  uh,
[7076.20 --> 7076.48]  you know,
[7076.56 --> 7077.48]  events and adventures.
[7078.64 --> 7080.54]  We have to go back to online dating,
[7080.70 --> 7083.32]  but for like jobs,
[7083.64 --> 7084.22]  I feel.
[7084.36 --> 7084.50]  Speed,
[7084.50 --> 7085.38]  speed applications.
[7085.58 --> 7087.20]  You all get together and like,
[7087.20 --> 7088.80]  like speed dating,
[7088.90 --> 7090.32]  but like job applications.
[7090.32 --> 7092.32]  crazy.
[7092.32 --> 7092.92]  Uh,
[7092.92 --> 7094.32]  crazy.
[7099.12 --> 7099.26]  Uh,
[7099.26 --> 7099.50]  no,
[7099.58 --> 7100.82]  do not show up here with a resume.
[7101.26 --> 7102.24]  I'm just saying,
[7102.36 --> 7102.98]  you know,
[7102.98 --> 7103.18]  it was,
[7103.28 --> 7103.50]  you know,
[7103.50 --> 7105.28]  it was very surprising to me when we did the,
[7105.28 --> 7105.64]  um,
[7105.64 --> 7106.76]  the screwdriver pop up.
[7106.84 --> 7107.08]  Oh,
[7107.16 --> 7107.56]  sorry,
[7107.56 --> 7107.80]  sorry,
[7107.80 --> 7107.90]  sorry,
[7107.90 --> 7107.98]  sorry,
[7107.98 --> 7108.06]  sorry.
[7108.20 --> 7109.82]  Tim zero zero zero X three.
[7109.92 --> 7111.08]  And I actually do believe this.
[7111.16 --> 7114.44]  My brother-in-law uses a bot to apply to 1000 jobs a day.
[7114.44 --> 7119.84]  He got 10 offers since he started zero before and people hear that.
[7122.40 --> 7126.72]  So then they start doing that because if you're getting zero offers,
[7126.84 --> 7127.28]  you're desperate,
[7127.38 --> 7127.50]  right?
[7127.50 --> 7128.38]  You're going to do something.
[7128.44 --> 7129.14]  This makes sense.
[7129.18 --> 7130.22]  You have to self preserve,
[7130.34 --> 7130.50]  right?
[7130.52 --> 7131.62]  People are going to try to fight.
[7131.86 --> 7133.18]  So they're going to hear that.
[7133.22 --> 7134.20]  Then they're going to start doing that.
[7134.24 --> 7137.50]  And now this person who was previously able to apply to,
[7137.60 --> 7137.86]  I don't know,
[7137.90 --> 7139.10]  maybe 50 jobs a day.
[7139.10 --> 7141.90]  Max is now applying to a thousand.
[7141.94 --> 7143.84]  Then you times that by a bunch of people.
[7143.84 --> 7146.44]  And then all the workplaces have too many applications.
[7146.64 --> 7149.16]  So it either takes them basically months to go through it,
[7149.22 --> 7149.76]  which is what,
[7149.84 --> 7152.92]  like some of the positions I've had where I have 2200 applicants,
[7152.92 --> 7153.12]  like,
[7153.18 --> 7153.26]  yeah,
[7153.26 --> 7155.64]  it's going to take an obscene amount of time to go through it all.
[7156.10 --> 7156.50]  Um,
[7156.58 --> 7159.78]  or they don't feel like doing all that work.
[7160.54 --> 7165.34]  So they just sort it with some algorithm or AI reading thing or something.
[7165.94 --> 7167.56]  So like their way,
[7167.68 --> 7169.58]  this is broken basically.
[7170.18 --> 7170.90]  And I'm not,
[7170.96 --> 7171.40]  I'm genuinely,
[7171.40 --> 7171.64]  I,
[7171.70 --> 7173.82]  I'd have no clue what the next step is,
[7173.84 --> 7174.54]  but I really hope,
[7174.78 --> 7175.12]  I don't know,
[7175.20 --> 7176.38]  some startup or something,
[7176.70 --> 7178.94]  find some solution to,
[7179.24 --> 7180.84]  to solve this.
[7180.84 --> 7181.48]  Cause it's,
[7181.48 --> 7181.94]  uh,
[7183.74 --> 7184.50]  so it's bad.
[7185.02 --> 7185.34]  Uh,
[7185.38 --> 7186.56]  at the precision pop-up,
[7186.62 --> 7192.66]  I noticed we had a little booth that was like an LMG jobs booth.
[7192.66 --> 7193.08]  And I was,
[7193.14 --> 7194.48]  Ariana and the,
[7194.48 --> 7194.70]  uh,
[7194.70 --> 7195.44]  the new HR.
[7195.64 --> 7195.80]  Oh,
[7195.86 --> 7196.06]  shoot.
[7198.46 --> 7198.82]  Probation,
[7198.98 --> 7199.18]  I think.
[7199.30 --> 7199.42]  Well,
[7199.62 --> 7199.94]  whatever.
[7200.12 --> 7200.34]  Whoops.
[7200.62 --> 7200.90]  Um,
[7200.90 --> 7201.88]  pretty sure that's wrong anyway.
[7201.88 --> 7202.62]  So I think you're okay.
[7202.74 --> 7203.10]  Nice.
[7205.90 --> 7206.26]  Yeah.
[7206.76 --> 7207.68]  Let's go with that.
[7207.94 --> 7208.36]  Um,
[7208.36 --> 7209.38]  I'm going to say pretty sure,
[7209.38 --> 7210.02]  but yeah.
[7210.44 --> 7210.78]  Cool.
[7210.88 --> 7211.20]  Anyway,
[7211.42 --> 7211.70]  uh,
[7211.70 --> 7214.26]  they were there and I dropped in and I was just like,
[7214.64 --> 7217.06]  what are you guys doing here?
[7217.40 --> 7217.94]  And they were like,
[7218.02 --> 7218.48]  Oh yeah,
[7218.50 --> 7218.94]  it was,
[7219.08 --> 7219.38]  uh,
[7219.44 --> 7221.22]  it was someone in management's idea.
[7221.22 --> 7221.68]  And I'm like,
[7222.06 --> 7222.44]  they're like,
[7222.48 --> 7223.44]  why is it a problem?
[7223.52 --> 7223.72]  I'm like,
[7223.94 --> 7224.26]  no,
[7224.32 --> 7230.60]  I'm just wouldn't have occurred to me in a thousand years to have like an LMG jobs booth at,
[7230.60 --> 7230.88]  uh,
[7230.88 --> 7231.58]  at like a,
[7231.82 --> 7233.76]  at like a product launch pop-up thing.
[7233.76 --> 7236.94]  But I talked to them after the fact and they were like,
[7237.00 --> 7237.10]  yeah,
[7237.14 --> 7238.22]  we were actually like,
[7238.22 --> 7239.76]  uh,
[7240.86 --> 7241.42]  what's the,
[7241.56 --> 7241.70]  well,
[7241.74 --> 7242.06]  not,
[7242.10 --> 7242.82]  not bumping,
[7243.00 --> 7243.32]  pumping,
[7243.56 --> 7244.66]  bumping would be like club,
[7244.86 --> 7245.12]  right?
[7245.18 --> 7245.32]  Yeah.
[7245.36 --> 7245.64]  They were,
[7245.68 --> 7246.42]  they were like booming,
[7246.58 --> 7246.78]  booming.
[7246.88 --> 7248.04]  Business was booming was,
[7248.22 --> 7249.82]  was effectively what they said.
[7249.92 --> 7250.86]  And I was like,
[7250.92 --> 7251.20]  Oh,
[7251.48 --> 7253.08]  that is cool.
[7253.16 --> 7253.74]  And I,
[7253.80 --> 7256.54]  I guess in the context of this conversation,
[7256.54 --> 7258.88]  that makes sense.
[7258.88 --> 7263.40]  Like we're going back to in human connections to,
[7263.76 --> 7264.56]  wild,
[7264.68 --> 7264.90]  right?
[7265.08 --> 7265.40]  Like,
[7265.44 --> 7265.86]  that's not,
[7266.02 --> 7267.46]  that's not what I was told growing up.
[7267.48 --> 7268.14]  I was told,
[7268.42 --> 7268.80]  you know,
[7269.14 --> 7269.90]  send your resume,
[7270.36 --> 7271.44]  maybe drop it off,
[7271.92 --> 7273.22]  ask to speak to a hiring manager,
[7273.22 --> 7273.52]  but like,
[7273.56 --> 7273.86]  good luck.
[7273.94 --> 7277.04]  None of them are going to talk to you by the time that advice made its way to me.
[7277.04 --> 7277.36]  So,
[7277.52 --> 7277.62]  yeah.
[7279.74 --> 7280.14]  Wild.
[7281.04 --> 7284.72]  I don't know if I ever got a job out of the blue.
[7286.02 --> 7288.72]  I'm trying to think like I volunteered at the pool.
[7289.78 --> 7290.22]  Um,
[7290.46 --> 7290.98]  Oh dude.
[7291.46 --> 7291.74]  What?
[7292.52 --> 7293.62]  My family just,
[7294.12 --> 7294.54]  Oh yeah.
[7294.58 --> 7295.16]  All of us.
[7296.28 --> 7302.96]  My mom got into the film industry by biking up to a film set and like talking to the director.
[7303.92 --> 7304.60]  And then,
[7304.60 --> 7305.18]  uh,
[7305.18 --> 7307.20]  the director could tell they were in like the middle of nowhere.
[7307.40 --> 7308.04]  So he was like,
[7308.06 --> 7308.18]  yeah,
[7308.18 --> 7308.40]  sure.
[7308.40 --> 7309.02]  Bring me a resume.
[7309.02 --> 7310.44]  Like today as like a joke.
[7310.56 --> 7314.96]  And she actually biked all the way back home and then biked all the way back to the set and gave a resume.
[7314.96 --> 7315.46]  And he was like,
[7315.52 --> 7316.94]  that's not sure you have a job.
[7317.02 --> 7318.12]  And then she became,
[7318.26 --> 7319.76]  that was a union position.
[7319.76 --> 7321.44]  So she skipped the whole,
[7321.44 --> 7326.28]  like you have to work through indies to get into the union thing because she technically got union hours from that,
[7326.34 --> 7327.46]  meaning that she was in the union.
[7327.46 --> 7330.42]  So then she was just working for like big Netflix shows immediately.
[7330.42 --> 7331.64]  Um,
[7331.88 --> 7334.96]  almost all of my early career jobs.
[7334.96 --> 7337.54]  I just got by like basically showing up and being like,
[7337.58 --> 7338.66]  I'll work right now.
[7339.42 --> 7341.02]  I can do this right now.
[7341.02 --> 7341.80]  And they were like,
[7342.02 --> 7342.30]  uh,
[7342.30 --> 7342.56]  sure.
[7346.18 --> 7348.24]  I'm sure my brother has similar stories.
[7349.56 --> 7350.76]  My family's kind of,
[7350.92 --> 7351.06]  yeah,
[7351.08 --> 7352.04]  we've been all over that.
[7352.34 --> 7352.74]  Um,
[7354.18 --> 7354.46]  huh?
[7354.86 --> 7355.14]  Yeah.
[7355.28 --> 7355.60]  Uh,
[7355.90 --> 7357.06]  in response to your question,
[7357.12 --> 7358.24]  how'd I get a job at NCIX?
[7358.48 --> 7358.76]  I,
[7358.90 --> 7360.58]  I was well known on their forum.
[7361.12 --> 7363.28]  They had thousands and thousands of posts.
[7363.36 --> 7365.76]  They very much knew who I was before I showed up with the resume.
[7365.98 --> 7367.40]  Kind of how Sean got a job.
[7368.62 --> 7369.18]  Sort of.
[7369.26 --> 7370.02]  He still had to like,
[7370.02 --> 7370.80]  from our infer team.
[7370.94 --> 7372.84]  Win the interview rounds or whatever.
[7373.00 --> 7373.12]  Yeah.
[7373.12 --> 7374.16]  Like he had to go through the process.
[7374.22 --> 7375.88]  But we absolutely knew who he was.
[7376.00 --> 7376.16]  Yeah.
[7376.62 --> 7376.98]  Um,
[7378.78 --> 7379.30]  all right.
[7380.52 --> 7380.88]  But yeah,
[7380.92 --> 7381.10]  it,
[7381.14 --> 7382.16]  it sucks out there.
[7382.50 --> 7383.74]  It sucks real bad.
[7383.80 --> 7388.50]  It sucks for both sides because I've gone to pretty crazy lengths and it's
[7388.50 --> 7391.30]  sometimes taken a long time to fill positions in,
[7391.36 --> 7395.08]  in some of my teams because of the insane waves of applicants we'll get.
[7395.20 --> 7396.02]  The most we ever got,
[7396.08 --> 7396.84]  I think was like 22,
[7396.94 --> 7397.46]  2300,
[7397.62 --> 7400.00]  but properly giving an appropriate,
[7400.00 --> 7402.88]  amount of time to each one of the 22 ish,
[7402.88 --> 7405.74]  hundred applications is brutal.
[7405.96 --> 7406.62]  Hold on a second.
[7406.72 --> 7408.22]  Who is top gear 1224?
[7408.60 --> 7409.96]  Says he was notorious.
[7410.28 --> 7410.72]  Actually.
[7411.50 --> 7413.96]  What was your username on the NCIX forum?
[7414.38 --> 7415.06]  You too,
[7415.20 --> 7415.68]  Tybeck.
[7415.68 --> 7419.06]  I want to know now.
[7419.06 --> 7420.60]  A new Linus from the NCIX forum.
[7420.64 --> 7421.16]  Let's see if I,
[7421.24 --> 7425.02]  let's see if I remember them or if I get to pull Thanos,
[7425.12 --> 7426.28]  I don't even know who you are.
[7429.56 --> 7430.00]  Yeah.
[7430.06 --> 7431.26]  We'll see if we get a response anyway.
[7431.42 --> 7431.64]  Sorry.
[7431.74 --> 7432.98]  I got distracted there.
[7433.38 --> 7433.76]  Uh,
[7433.80 --> 7433.98]  yeah,
[7434.00 --> 7434.20]  no.
[7434.20 --> 7434.84]  So like it,
[7434.84 --> 7435.10]  it,
[7435.10 --> 7435.16]  it,
[7435.16 --> 7437.40]  it sucks for the people putting in applications.
[7438.28 --> 7438.72]  Um,
[7438.72 --> 7444.76]  and it also sucks for the other side because I don't know that having an ocean of applicants
[7444.76 --> 7450.10]  actually means that you are for sure going to get like the best one.
[7450.10 --> 7455.86]  Cause it's such a crap shoot when you're just going off of pieces of paper that try to describe a person.
[7456.68 --> 7457.34]  It's like,
[7457.42 --> 7458.30]  no,
[7458.42 --> 7458.58]  dude.
[7458.66 --> 7460.04]  Depends on what they're applying for.
[7460.12 --> 7462.10]  Like if they're applying for a writing position,
[7462.40 --> 7463.46]  piece of paper is pretty good.
[7463.84 --> 7464.02]  Yeah.
[7464.02 --> 7465.82]  Maybe as long as they actually wrote it.
[7465.82 --> 7467.06]  If the piece of paper is writing,
[7467.18 --> 7472.54]  but are you actually getting the writing sample with the initial application or are you just getting their resume and stuff?
[7472.54 --> 7474.34]  And then you request the writing sample afterwards.
[7474.50 --> 7474.62]  Depends.
[7474.72 --> 7474.84]  I mean,
[7474.86 --> 7475.86]  a lot of the time you can,
[7476.24 --> 7477.92]  at least if they actually wrote it,
[7477.94 --> 7481.12]  you can tell a lot about someone's writing ability from their resume.
[7481.26 --> 7481.60]  Another problem.
[7481.70 --> 7482.10]  Cause it's,
[7482.24 --> 7483.44]  it's pretty easy.
[7483.50 --> 7483.72]  Like,
[7484.26 --> 7484.64]  okay,
[7484.76 --> 7485.18]  cool.
[7485.18 --> 7487.10]  We have this super neato.
[7487.96 --> 7489.96]  Was this written by AI checker?
[7490.06 --> 7493.28]  Except that so do the people that are trying to get past it.
[7493.32 --> 7495.98]  So they can just make small edits until it says 0%.
[7495.98 --> 7498.62]  Like it doesn't mean anything.
[7500.26 --> 7502.66]  Top gear was memeing and tie back says,
[7502.76 --> 7503.50]  you don't know me,
[7503.60 --> 7506.70]  but you were impossible to miss on the NCIX forms.
[7507.24 --> 7508.20]  That sounds likely.
[7508.42 --> 7508.68]  Yeah.
[7509.26 --> 7510.12]  It's kind of my jam.
[7510.20 --> 7510.34]  No,
[7510.40 --> 7511.10]  there's no archive.
[7511.20 --> 7511.54]  No key.
[7511.80 --> 7513.04]  It's actually a real shame.
[7513.14 --> 7514.94]  There was a lot of technology lost there.
[7515.18 --> 7517.60]  It was low key,
[7517.90 --> 7520.24]  like kind of an amazing resource,
[7520.40 --> 7527.06]  an amazing archive because the threads about products were tied to the bottom of the product page.
[7527.06 --> 7529.98]  So if you browsed the product archive,
[7529.98 --> 7533.88]  you could find all this discussion about products that was highly,
[7534.06 --> 7538.18]  highly relevant and probably difficult to track down anywhere else.
[7538.18 --> 7542.92]  It's a real shame that that site is just vanished into the ether.
[7542.92 --> 7549.76]  Now I maintain that I would love to acquire the domain and IP and resurrect it,
[7549.90 --> 7557.62]  but we have not been able to reach an agreement that I consider to be reasonable up until this time.
[7557.62 --> 7558.62]  And Taryn asked me about it.
[7558.62 --> 7559.74]  Taryn asked me about it the other day,
[7559.74 --> 7559.92]  though.
[7560.34 --> 7560.92]  He was like,
[7560.98 --> 7562.32]  do you like still want to do that?
[7562.38 --> 7562.60]  I'm like,
[7562.60 --> 7562.96]  sure.
[7563.52 --> 7564.84]  Like if you can negotiate it,
[7564.90 --> 7567.42]  but the offer that I got last time was not,
[7568.06 --> 7569.50]  had no basis in reality.
[7569.86 --> 7571.94]  So it was very difficult for me to,
[7572.02 --> 7572.26]  uh,
[7572.26 --> 7573.44]  as time goes on too,
[7573.48 --> 7574.64]  it's worth less and less.
[7574.64 --> 7574.82]  Like,
[7574.84 --> 7575.90]  are they recognizing that?
[7576.70 --> 7577.38]  I don't know.
[7578.00 --> 7578.26]  I,
[7578.36 --> 7578.48]  I mean,
[7578.48 --> 7579.80]  I haven't talked to them about it in a while.
[7579.80 --> 7582.00]  Basically the last time I made an offer,
[7582.00 --> 7589.72]  it was pretty much based on the cost of a four letter.com and then plus like some,
[7589.72 --> 7590.94]  um,
[7590.94 --> 7596.88]  and then what they came back to me with was essentially an offer that,
[7596.88 --> 7597.72]  um,
[7598.82 --> 7601.88]  would have some kind of like long-term revenue share.
[7601.88 --> 7602.24]  No.
[7602.30 --> 7603.04]  Like a bunch of,
[7603.08 --> 7603.98]  and I'm sitting here going,
[7604.20 --> 7604.40]  no,
[7604.52 --> 7608.24]  you understand that this brand is like completely trashed and worthless,
[7608.24 --> 7608.66]  right?
[7608.72 --> 7609.56]  Like it's not,
[7609.58 --> 7610.14]  um,
[7610.94 --> 7619.54]  even the people who know what NCIX is know that it imploded spectacularly and was like shady at the end.
[7619.54 --> 7620.00]  Like it's,
[7620.06 --> 7622.86]  it's the IP is worth nothing.
[7622.92 --> 7624.52]  The brand is worth nothing.
[7624.82 --> 7629.90]  It's a four letter.com with people's personal information on them were auctioned off.
[7630.10 --> 7630.58]  Yeah.
[7631.26 --> 7631.74]  Yeah.
[7631.74 --> 7632.20]  It's,
[7632.28 --> 7632.52]  uh,
[7632.52 --> 7634.46]  um,
[7634.84 --> 7636.34]  the bit man asks,
[7636.44 --> 7638.28]  if you got NCIX.com,
[7638.34 --> 7640.16]  would you bring back the net linked name?
[7641.44 --> 7641.88]  No,
[7641.96 --> 7642.38]  I think,
[7642.54 --> 7645.72]  I think what I would do with the NCIX channel is,
[7645.72 --> 7646.28]  uh,
[7646.28 --> 7646.78]  like a,
[7646.78 --> 7648.64]  like a software and troubleshooting channel.
[7648.64 --> 7650.68]  I think that would be,
[7650.68 --> 7659.48]  that would be the closest thing to sort of its origin story while also fitting in well with our current portfolio of channels.
[7659.48 --> 7659.78]  I would,
[7659.78 --> 7660.22]  I would love,
[7660.52 --> 7660.58]  I would love,
[7660.58 --> 7661.84]  I'd love to do something like that.
[7664.08 --> 7664.48]  Yeah.
[7664.60 --> 7665.28]  Top gear asks,
[7665.38 --> 7667.68]  is the issue of the creditors or the seller?
[7667.90 --> 7669.38]  Or that's not really what they asked,
[7669.44 --> 7669.78]  but whatever,
[7669.88 --> 7670.26]  close enough.
[7670.40 --> 7670.90]  Uh,
[7670.90 --> 7671.56]  it's a combination,
[7671.56 --> 7672.28]  right?
[7672.28 --> 7672.34]  Right.
[7672.34 --> 7679.44]  because the ownership of the IP was not necessarily the corporate,
[7679.44 --> 7680.32]  uh,
[7680.32 --> 7681.66]  Netlink computer Inc.
[7681.66 --> 7682.52]  so,
[7682.52 --> 7684.96]  if I were to acquire it,
[7685.12 --> 7689.06]  there could be some dispute as to who I was supposed to pay for it.
[7689.90 --> 7690.12]  Um,
[7690.12 --> 7690.82]  and none of that,
[7690.92 --> 7691.74]  as far as I can tell,
[7691.76 --> 7693.10]  has been legally resolved.
[7693.80 --> 7702.26]  And no one who's involved has any interest or any motivation to resolve it until someone comes in with a bag of money.
[7702.36 --> 7703.76]  So it's kind of a chicken and egg problem.
[7704.80 --> 7706.38]  So I just think it's just gonna,
[7707.08 --> 7709.92]  I just think it's gonna just languish forever.
[7709.92 --> 7719.58]  And I think that's also something that the seller doesn't understand is the baggage associated and the risk associated with digging up this,
[7719.68 --> 7720.46]  this corpse,
[7720.68 --> 7720.92]  um,
[7721.96 --> 7723.04]  could be diseased.
[7723.18 --> 7724.24]  They'll just never sell it though.
[7725.64 --> 7726.24]  I mean,
[7726.24 --> 7727.24]  they'll die eventually.
[7728.54 --> 7729.28]  But that's,
[7729.46 --> 7730.94]  that's not them selling it.
[7731.32 --> 7731.54]  No,
[7731.64 --> 7732.68]  I just mean like,
[7732.74 --> 7733.08]  you know,
[7733.76 --> 7735.62]  I remember telling my wife at some point,
[7735.66 --> 7736.90]  she wanted me to like pick something up.
[7736.92 --> 7737.46]  And I was like,
[7737.48 --> 7739.08]  any problem goes away if you wait long enough.
[7739.08 --> 7739.42]  She's like,
[7739.48 --> 7739.72]  no,
[7739.92 --> 7740.42]  I'm like,
[7740.52 --> 7740.70]  no,
[7740.78 --> 7741.00]  really.
[7741.20 --> 7741.50]  I mean,
[7741.96 --> 7742.16]  yeah,
[7742.18 --> 7743.46]  eventually we're all just gonna,
[7743.64 --> 7743.78]  you know,
[7743.84 --> 7746.84]  big crunch or whatever the current theory is for how the universe ends.
[7747.62 --> 7748.68]  None of this is gonna matter.
[7748.88 --> 7748.98]  Yeah.
[7749.06 --> 7749.28]  Eventually.
[7749.54 --> 7751.80]  The fact that humans were on this planet will be irrelevant.
[7752.24 --> 7752.60]  Eventually.
[7752.92 --> 7753.28]  Eventually.
[7753.48 --> 7753.68]  Yeah.
[7753.90 --> 7754.10]  Sure.
[7756.08 --> 7757.36]  When the sun just goes,
[7757.70 --> 7757.96]  whoop.
[7759.04 --> 7759.32]  Wait,
[7759.34 --> 7760.70]  we digging up corpses to eat?
[7761.10 --> 7761.26]  No,
[7761.30 --> 7761.44]  no,
[7761.48 --> 7761.60]  no,
[7761.60 --> 7762.30]  just roadkill.
[7762.54 --> 7762.90]  I want to,
[7762.98 --> 7763.66]  I want to be U.S.
[7763.72 --> 7764.02]  president.
[7765.80 --> 7766.16]  Recycling.
[7767.52 --> 7767.92]  Um,
[7767.92 --> 7768.26]  all right.
[7768.28 --> 7769.00]  What are we talking about?
[7769.00 --> 7769.80]  More topics.
[7770.70 --> 7770.90]  Oh,
[7770.96 --> 7771.18]  sure.
[7771.26 --> 7771.50]  Yeah.
[7771.90 --> 7772.18]  Uh,
[7772.18 --> 7774.20]  this week in AI strawberries,
[7775.02 --> 7776.92]  UI benefits and meta being meta.
[7777.42 --> 7777.78]  Do you,
[7777.78 --> 7779.14]  do you want to do the AI roundup?
[7779.34 --> 7779.54]  Yeah,
[7779.62 --> 7779.84]  sure.
[7780.00 --> 7781.36]  Pretty interesting stuff this week.
[7781.36 --> 7782.28]  I wasn't sure.
[7782.28 --> 7783.28]  I didn't know that,
[7783.28 --> 7784.18]  uh,
[7784.18 --> 7787.70]  strawberry was actually a one.
[7788.18 --> 7788.62]  Um,
[7788.66 --> 7789.32]  I don't know.
[7790.04 --> 7791.88]  I didn't dive super far into that.
[7791.92 --> 7793.54]  So maybe the person who wrote this is,
[7793.60 --> 7794.18]  is correct.
[7794.18 --> 7794.62]  I just,
[7794.72 --> 7795.98]  I didn't think that was the case,
[7795.98 --> 7797.96]  but I didn't verify this or anything.
[7798.54 --> 7798.98]  Um,
[7798.98 --> 7799.84]  so maybe it is,
[7799.84 --> 7800.48]  I'm not really sure,
[7800.58 --> 7800.76]  but,
[7801.14 --> 7801.66]  uh,
[7801.66 --> 7802.20]  either way,
[7802.20 --> 7803.60]  I'll go through the talking points regardless.
[7803.60 --> 7805.12]  And then if you guys want to look that up,
[7805.12 --> 7806.38]  if you care at all,
[7806.48 --> 7807.20]  then you can do that.
[7807.38 --> 7807.50]  Sure.
[7808.12 --> 7808.48]  Um,
[7809.20 --> 7810.10]  but I'll go through the talking points.
[7810.20 --> 7813.18]  Open AI has unveiled its new strawberry AI language.
[7813.18 --> 7813.62]  Starberry.
[7814.38 --> 7814.58]  Star,
[7814.82 --> 7815.22]  star,
[7815.22 --> 7815.26]  star.
[7815.26 --> 7817.88]  I thought it was strawberry.
[7818.16 --> 7818.22]  Oh wait,
[7818.28 --> 7818.38]  no,
[7818.42 --> 7818.68]  it is.
[7819.10 --> 7819.74]  It is strawberry.
[7819.98 --> 7820.08]  Oh,
[7820.14 --> 7821.22]  it's starberry in the dark.
[7821.30 --> 7821.72]  Why does there,
[7821.84 --> 7823.30]  why do I know it say starberry?
[7823.46 --> 7823.60]  Yeah,
[7823.60 --> 7824.40]  I thought it was strawberry.
[7824.62 --> 7824.84]  Gosh,
[7824.90 --> 7825.22]  darn it.
[7825.32 --> 7825.46]  No,
[7825.50 --> 7825.90]  it's okay.
[7825.98 --> 7826.16]  Well,
[7826.18 --> 7826.56]  that's fine.
[7826.64 --> 7827.68]  Handyman is saying it is.
[7828.02 --> 7828.54]  Starberry 01.
[7828.78 --> 7829.46]  I think he means.
[7829.78 --> 7830.48]  Strawberry 01.
[7830.74 --> 7831.78]  I think he means that it's.
[7831.78 --> 7831.98]  Look,
[7832.02 --> 7832.88]  if you want real news,
[7832.94 --> 7833.90]  go watch a different show.
[7834.64 --> 7835.88]  This is just us talking.
[7836.20 --> 7837.64]  I do have some cool stuff to show for this,
[7837.72 --> 7838.04]  but yeah.
[7838.28 --> 7838.50]  Okay.
[7838.56 --> 7839.00]  So strawberry,
[7839.08 --> 7840.02]  I guess it is the same thing.
[7840.10 --> 7840.34]  Thank you,
[7840.38 --> 7840.74]  handyman.
[7840.86 --> 7841.54]  I believe handyman.
[7841.54 --> 7846.96]  So they unveiled their new strawberry AI language model,
[7847.08 --> 7851.76]  which the company says has significantly improved reasoning and problem solving abilities.
[7852.00 --> 7858.46]  The new model's official name is open AI 01 with initial versions available now,
[7858.56 --> 7860.66]  which are 01 preview and 01 mini.
[7861.08 --> 7866.10]  Open AI says that 01 preview outdoes GPT 4.0 in competitive programming,
[7866.50 --> 7866.94]  mathematics,
[7867.10 --> 7868.24]  and scientific reasoning.
[7868.24 --> 7868.92]  Users,
[7869.12 --> 7869.36]  however,
[7869.52 --> 7875.40]  say that this improvement is far from global and comes with significant delay due to the
[7875.40 --> 7878.54]  multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query.
[7879.00 --> 7880.02]  And before we move on,
[7880.02 --> 7884.28]  before we move on to other this week in AI topics,
[7884.28 --> 7887.54]  I want to go over some of the things that I did.
[7888.00 --> 7888.10]  Oh,
[7889.10 --> 7890.28]  Luke did a thing.
[7890.28 --> 7895.92]  So one of the examples that they had was how many E's are in the word strawberry,
[7896.18 --> 7896.38]  which is,
[7896.48 --> 7896.92]  I think why,
[7897.10 --> 7897.54]  or sorry,
[7897.70 --> 7898.40]  how many R's,
[7898.50 --> 7900.22]  how many R's are E's or R's?
[7900.28 --> 7900.40]  Yeah,
[7900.52 --> 7900.84]  R's.
[7900.90 --> 7902.44]  I did E's because I wanted to switch it up.
[7902.76 --> 7904.20]  So how many R's are in strawberry?
[7904.96 --> 7905.48]  Hold on.
[7905.50 --> 7906.34]  Is this a trick question?
[7906.88 --> 7907.18]  Three?
[7907.62 --> 7907.84]  No,
[7908.20 --> 7909.20]  it used to say two.
[7909.58 --> 7910.40]  It used to say two.
[7910.50 --> 7912.76]  So previous models would say two because it,
[7912.76 --> 7915.48]  it couldn't like count very well.
[7915.54 --> 7916.14]  It didn't have,
[7916.44 --> 7916.64]  Oh,
[7916.76 --> 7918.34]  it couldn't like deconstruct problems,
[7918.42 --> 7918.94]  things like that.
[7918.94 --> 7919.96]  Um,
[7920.18 --> 7920.58]  okay.
[7921.28 --> 7922.88]  So I dumped,
[7922.96 --> 7923.06]  Oh,
[7923.12 --> 7925.02]  I actually don't want to show you all that.
[7925.10 --> 7925.38]  Anyways,
[7925.40 --> 7925.80]  I already did.
[7925.86 --> 7926.24]  That's fine.
[7926.28 --> 7927.56]  We're doing some stuff with OVH.
[7927.60 --> 7928.18]  It's going to be cool.
[7928.70 --> 7929.06]  Um,
[7929.42 --> 7931.28]  I copied some texts that I had,
[7931.28 --> 7931.78]  uh,
[7931.78 --> 7935.90]  and had it count the amount of E's that were in it and it did it.
[7935.90 --> 7936.54]  And then I was like,
[7936.54 --> 7937.82]  I don't want to verify that.
[7937.82 --> 7940.24]  So I made a smaller amount and then asked it to count that.
[7940.24 --> 7942.10]  And then I did verify it and they were correct.
[7942.58 --> 7944.28]  So it can count that properly now,
[7944.38 --> 7944.90]  which is cool.
[7945.44 --> 7945.78]  Okay.
[7945.80 --> 7946.94]  I didn't know that was hard.
[7947.32 --> 7947.84]  That was,
[7947.84 --> 7949.40]  that was not super easy.
[7949.40 --> 7951.40]  And then I looked up a,
[7951.40 --> 7952.36]  uh,
[7952.36 --> 7955.44]  a calculus question,
[7955.44 --> 7958.40]  a fairly basic one,
[7958.44 --> 7959.52]  as far as my understanding goes.
[7959.68 --> 7962.48]  And I compared its answer to,
[7962.48 --> 7963.46]  um,
[7964.00 --> 7965.54]  what the internet said.
[7965.90 --> 7967.30]  And it sounded like it was pretty correct.
[7967.38 --> 7968.36]  Ignore this part.
[7968.90 --> 7969.46]  Uh,
[7970.24 --> 7973.26]  you mind zooming a little on the calculus question?
[7973.26 --> 7974.30]  I just,
[7974.52 --> 7975.26]  in general,
[7975.48 --> 7976.64]  do you mind zooming a little?
[7977.04 --> 7977.52]  This is a,
[7977.64 --> 7977.90]  no,
[7977.96 --> 7979.16]  it's not control plus.
[7979.26 --> 7979.60]  Okay.
[7981.92 --> 7982.36]  Uh,
[7982.42 --> 7982.74]  but yeah,
[7982.74 --> 7983.24]  it's interesting.
[7983.24 --> 7985.72]  It came to the same final conclusion that I found in,
[7985.72 --> 7986.82]  in answer banks on the internet,
[7986.82 --> 7987.50]  which was interesting.
[7987.50 --> 7993.34]  And then this is a question that I had shown on Wancho before that it couldn't answer,
[7993.52 --> 7996.96]  which was this New York times game with the rules of the game.
[7996.96 --> 8000.32]  And then can it do it basically?
[8000.44 --> 8000.58]  Right.
[8001.12 --> 8001.34]  Oh,
[8001.40 --> 8002.20]  it totally did.
[8002.60 --> 8004.08]  So that was wrong.
[8004.56 --> 8004.76]  Oh,
[8004.78 --> 8005.14]  it was?
[8005.32 --> 8005.54]  Uh,
[8005.54 --> 8007.20]  because I was trying to see,
[8007.32 --> 8008.52]  so this new,
[8008.70 --> 8009.70]  the O1 preview,
[8009.88 --> 8010.88]  you can't do attachments.
[8011.42 --> 8015.98]  So I was trying to see if I switch to a previous model,
[8016.26 --> 8018.22]  like GPT-4O and do an attachment,
[8018.22 --> 8022.28]  can I then switch to O1 preview and make it read the attachment?
[8022.54 --> 8022.56]  Yeah.
[8022.68 --> 8023.38]  The answer is no.
[8023.80 --> 8024.20]  Um,
[8024.20 --> 8026.94]  it no longer allows you to switch the second that you have an attachment.
[8027.58 --> 8028.02]  Um,
[8028.34 --> 8031.72]  but I just fed it the information this way,
[8031.72 --> 8033.44]  instead of inserting a picture.
[8033.88 --> 8036.14]  So I just laid it out for it.
[8036.16 --> 8036.56]  Basically.
[8036.82 --> 8037.26]  Yeah.
[8037.26 --> 8039.26]  It took 62 seconds,
[8039.50 --> 8041.66]  but it was not wrong.
[8041.76 --> 8042.52]  It won the game.
[8042.86 --> 8043.34]  Wow.
[8043.64 --> 8044.00]  Instantly.
[8044.14 --> 8044.46]  Well,
[8044.86 --> 8045.92]  in 62 seconds.
[8046.16 --> 8046.24]  Yeah.
[8046.70 --> 8048.82]  I then kind of realized,
[8048.94 --> 8049.22]  you know,
[8049.38 --> 8051.96]  the works instantly 62 seconds of the time.
[8051.96 --> 8054.02]  I mean more like the first time it tried,
[8054.14 --> 8054.26]  but,
[8054.46 --> 8055.06]  um,
[8055.26 --> 8058.70]  so the challenge here.
[8059.34 --> 8059.86]  Oh,
[8059.86 --> 8063.34]  I don't think I even told it.
[8066.30 --> 8066.70]  Okay.
[8066.86 --> 8069.30]  I didn't actually ask it to do it in six words.
[8069.58 --> 8069.98]  Yes,
[8070.06 --> 8070.42]  Christopher,
[8070.60 --> 8071.06]  we do.
[8071.58 --> 8073.56]  I didn't ask it to do it in six words,
[8073.68 --> 8077.06]  but the goal this time was to do it in six words.
[8077.16 --> 8078.08]  Sometimes they'll be like,
[8078.12 --> 8078.24]  Oh,
[8078.30 --> 8080.02]  do it and try to do it in four words or whatever.
[8080.30 --> 8080.48]  Yeah.
[8080.48 --> 8081.62]  And when I play with Emma,
[8081.72 --> 8085.38]  usually we try to beat the amount that it asks you to beat it in.
[8085.38 --> 8086.52]  So it says six words.
[8086.56 --> 8088.24]  We'll try to do it in four words or whatever else.
[8088.86 --> 8089.26]  Um,
[8089.52 --> 8092.28]  so I then asked it after I did it right away.
[8092.34 --> 8093.16]  The first time I said,
[8093.24 --> 8095.18]  can you do it in as few words as possible?
[8095.90 --> 8097.20]  Because that's not in the rules.
[8097.20 --> 8100.20]  So it wasn't aiming to necessarily do it in a few words as possible.
[8100.50 --> 8102.74]  And then we went way off the rails.
[8103.18 --> 8103.66]  Uh,
[8103.70 --> 8104.78]  this was rough.
[8104.78 --> 8105.26]  Uh,
[8105.44 --> 8106.94]  um,
[8106.94 --> 8111.76]  after Y we need a word starting with K so we can consider the last letter of
[8111.76 --> 8114.78]  Koi is K by rearranging the sequence slightly,
[8114.78 --> 8118.64]  which is not a thing at all.
[8118.92 --> 8119.40]  Um,
[8120.26 --> 8120.74]  additionally,
[8120.88 --> 8121.38]  alternatively,
[8121.38 --> 8122.94]  we can add a bridging word if necessary,
[8122.94 --> 8124.26]  which is necessary.
[8124.42 --> 8128.42]  And then it just didn't do it and decided the last letter of Koi was K.
[8128.86 --> 8129.46]  Um,
[8129.46 --> 8129.74]  which,
[8129.82 --> 8130.08]  um,
[8130.08 --> 8132.90]  is a really different misspelled word.
[8133.10 --> 8133.80]  Not how that works.
[8133.88 --> 8134.02]  Yeah.
[8134.02 --> 8137.02]  So I tried to work with it and then it ended up answering,
[8137.14 --> 8141.88]  but it answered like sort of multiple times in one answer.
[8141.88 --> 8144.90]  And also the final one was actually eight words.
[8145.06 --> 8145.92]  And it was like,
[8145.96 --> 8146.52]  congratulations,
[8146.74 --> 8148.00]  you won using eight words.
[8148.00 --> 8148.56]  And I was like,
[8148.60 --> 8148.96]  that's,
[8149.04 --> 8149.46]  uh,
[8149.70 --> 8151.58]  that's worse than six.
[8151.98 --> 8152.46]  Uh,
[8152.74 --> 8153.66]  so yeah,
[8153.66 --> 8154.18]  I don't know.
[8154.32 --> 8154.64]  Um,
[8154.64 --> 8159.98]  it's not a silver bullet and in classic open AI fashion,
[8159.98 --> 8162.40]  they're being a little closed about how it works.
[8162.64 --> 8163.08]  Um,
[8163.08 --> 8163.44]  nice,
[8163.58 --> 8166.54]  but it is interesting.
[8166.70 --> 8170.42]  You can see it sort of think like throw,
[8170.54 --> 8172.48]  throw a question at me and I'll show you how it,
[8172.64 --> 8174.28]  how it in quotes thinks,
[8174.28 --> 8175.76]  because this part's actually important.
[8177.04 --> 8177.48]  Um,
[8177.96 --> 8179.64]  sorry,
[8179.68 --> 8180.14]  what do you want?
[8180.18 --> 8180.80]  You want a question?
[8180.88 --> 8181.02]  Throw,
[8181.12 --> 8182.72]  throw something at me to throw it at,
[8182.94 --> 8183.78]  uh,
[8183.78 --> 8184.94]  um,
[8184.94 --> 8187.26]  what's better,
[8187.40 --> 8189.54]  a zip up hoodie or a pullover?
[8190.40 --> 8190.76]  Sure.
[8190.84 --> 8191.16]  Why not?
[8191.54 --> 8192.06]  I don't know.
[8192.24 --> 8194.00]  Not like you putting me on the spot here.
[8194.10 --> 8195.34]  I don't know if that's a smart question.
[8196.04 --> 8196.70]  It's not,
[8196.70 --> 8200.52]  but let's see.
[8200.74 --> 8202.80]  So when it does this whole thinking thing,
[8202.84 --> 8203.82]  we'll see if it actually has to think.
[8203.90 --> 8204.08]  Yeah.
[8204.16 --> 8204.40]  Okay.
[8205.16 --> 8206.30]  So we can see what it does.
[8206.76 --> 8208.08]  Evaluating hoodie types.
[8208.08 --> 8209.08]  Yeah.
[8211.30 --> 8211.54]  Cool.
[8211.58 --> 8212.10]  It's very neutral.
[8212.20 --> 8212.58]  Very good.
[8212.92 --> 8213.36]  Um,
[8213.48 --> 8216.12]  but you can see the steps that it took.
[8218.20 --> 8220.12]  Noticing convenience and style.
[8221.72 --> 8225.46]  Designs and casual aesthetics while pullover hoodies excel in warmth and simplicity.
[8225.88 --> 8227.38]  And I wanted to dive more into it.
[8227.38 --> 8229.84]  I wanted to try to play chess against it to see its spatial reasoning,
[8230.16 --> 8230.92]  but I didn't have time.
[8231.44 --> 8231.76]  Um,
[8232.28 --> 8232.72]  but I was,
[8232.78 --> 8235.16]  I was chatting back and forth with Wendell about this for a second.
[8236.30 --> 8237.36]  These are odd.
[8238.08 --> 8239.44]  These are weird.
[8240.20 --> 8240.50]  Oh yeah.
[8241.62 --> 8243.28]  Noticing convenience and style.
[8243.38 --> 8244.46]  Did it notice that?
[8245.18 --> 8246.28]  Did that happen?
[8247.30 --> 8247.94]  They're like,
[8248.08 --> 8252.78]  they're very humanized ways of doing this.
[8252.96 --> 8253.20]  Right.
[8253.24 --> 8255.50]  But is it actually different from what it was doing before?
[8257.08 --> 8257.74]  It's,
[8257.84 --> 8258.30]  uh,
[8258.40 --> 8259.18]  I think,
[8259.32 --> 8265.08]  I feel like they're trying to make it more approachable and friendly by humanizing it.
[8265.08 --> 8265.68]  Mm hmm.
[8265.74 --> 8267.76]  And I don't know if I like that.
[8268.08 --> 8273.12]  And I wonder if this is part of the contention that has led to certain people leaving,
[8273.12 --> 8274.46]  um,
[8274.86 --> 8275.46]  open AI.
[8275.76 --> 8276.08]  Hmm.
[8276.30 --> 8278.74]  Cause this is like genuinely kind of weird.
[8279.64 --> 8280.16]  Um,
[8280.16 --> 8286.66]  I think they just generate random text to it.
[8286.66 --> 8287.56]  Cause like,
[8287.56 --> 8291.98]  this is all factors that would have had to be considered by any other previous model anyway.
[8292.54 --> 8296.20]  So if the only difference is that like,
[8296.26 --> 8297.26]  and how do they,
[8297.42 --> 8301.94]  how do they prove that this has anything to do with the actual model training anyway?
[8301.94 --> 8302.72]  Like I don't,
[8302.72 --> 8309.46]  why would open AI be motivated to show us any part of the,
[8309.52 --> 8316.20]  of the narrowing down and categorization that helped it to understand my two comparatives here?
[8316.44 --> 8316.74]  Well,
[8316.76 --> 8320.10]  originally they were supposed to be open and now they're like the least open version.
[8320.10 --> 8320.88]  Um,
[8321.30 --> 8322.86]  so I think that's why they would show us,
[8322.98 --> 8323.86]  but I,
[8323.92 --> 8327.04]  I think in my opinion,
[8327.04 --> 8330.46]  the reason why they're showing these steps is they're trying to justify the time taken,
[8330.56 --> 8331.02]  which is,
[8331.20 --> 8331.88]  that does make sense.
[8331.98 --> 8333.14]  This is why it's taking time.
[8333.54 --> 8334.02]  Um,
[8334.02 --> 8335.96]  because it's not blitzing towards one answer.
[8335.96 --> 8344.76]  It's trying to compartmentalize the question that you asked and then solve each section individually and then bring an answer to you,
[8344.76 --> 8345.70]  um,
[8346.40 --> 8346.64]  to,
[8346.74 --> 8347.40]  to deal though.
[8347.42 --> 8347.92]  That's like the,
[8347.94 --> 8349.48]  the whole reasoning steps and stuff.
[8349.58 --> 8351.22]  I haven't done enough research on how this works yet.
[8351.28 --> 8352.06]  This broke yesterday.
[8352.06 --> 8352.74]  I've had no time,
[8352.74 --> 8353.00]  but,
[8353.46 --> 8353.98]  um,
[8355.32 --> 8355.74]  it's,
[8355.86 --> 8357.56]  it's definitely interesting.
[8357.56 --> 8360.12]  It is worse than old models at certain things.
[8361.56 --> 8362.00]  Um,
[8363.00 --> 8365.78]  some people have called that like an overthinking problem.
[8365.96 --> 8366.66]  Hmm.
[8367.24 --> 8368.72]  Where sometimes the,
[8368.72 --> 8371.48]  the solution is like easier than it tries to make it.
[8371.88 --> 8372.44]  Um,
[8372.48 --> 8374.58]  and by in quotes,
[8374.62 --> 8374.96]  again,
[8375.02 --> 8375.74]  overthinking,
[8375.90 --> 8376.72]  um,
[8376.72 --> 8376.94]  it,
[8377.00 --> 8378.60]  it causes some problems here and there,
[8378.60 --> 8380.80]  but yeah,
[8380.80 --> 8383.70]  they don't show it.
[8383.70 --> 8384.64]  Actually it's faking.
[8384.64 --> 8386.32]  They hide it for competition.
[8386.56 --> 8386.74]  Yeah.
[8386.88 --> 8387.04]  I,
[8387.18 --> 8387.56]  I mean,
[8387.72 --> 8387.92]  I,
[8388.10 --> 8388.48]  okay.
[8392.66 --> 8394.04]  Like I was saying there,
[8394.12 --> 8394.28]  there,
[8394.40 --> 8395.90]  there's very strongly,
[8395.90 --> 8397.46]  humanizing what it's doing.
[8397.46 --> 8397.92]  They're not,
[8398.04 --> 8398.36]  they're not,
[8398.44 --> 8399.92]  it's not exactly what's happening.
[8400.02 --> 8401.06]  That's fairly obvious.
[8401.06 --> 8402.14]  It doesn't work that way.
[8402.20 --> 8403.32]  It's not personifying.
[8403.76 --> 8404.04]  Yeah.
[8404.74 --> 8405.18]  Um,
[8405.24 --> 8405.86]  but then was it all,
[8405.94 --> 8407.88]  wasn't it kind of already like friendly?
[8409.02 --> 8409.46]  Yeah.
[8409.46 --> 8410.26]  I don't really see the difference.
[8410.26 --> 8411.40]  By doing that dropdown,
[8411.40 --> 8413.88]  it feels like you're trying to look behind the curtain.
[8414.48 --> 8415.16]  I see.
[8415.28 --> 8416.26]  And there's another curtain.
[8416.58 --> 8421.54]  And I don't think like in the same way that people used to argue with me before it was able to look on the internet.
[8421.66 --> 8421.88]  They're like,
[8421.92 --> 8422.04]  no,
[8422.08 --> 8423.10]  it is looking on the internet.
[8423.22 --> 8423.80]  Do you remember that?
[8423.88 --> 8424.00]  Yeah.
[8424.30 --> 8425.52]  People aren't going to get this.
[8425.86 --> 8426.50]  I see.
[8426.90 --> 8427.28]  And I,
[8427.30 --> 8427.88]  I don't,
[8427.96 --> 8431.16]  I don't necessarily think that's good.
[8431.32 --> 8431.84]  You know,
[8431.84 --> 8434.10]  in other news,
[8434.94 --> 8436.64]  speaking of things that are not that great,
[8437.00 --> 8437.20]  uh,
[8437.20 --> 8453.26]  the state of Nevada has announced that it has paid $1.3 million for a Google powered AI system that will assess unemployment claims using evidentiary documents and transcripts from appeals hearings and recommend to a human referee whether to approve or deny benefits.
[8454.12 --> 8461.82]  Nevada officials promise that every case will receive human review and they expect the new system will eliminate the backlog of cases that has existed since the pandemic.
[8461.82 --> 8467.80]  By reducing the time it takes to write a determination from several hours to just five minutes in some cases.
[8469.80 --> 8470.84]  Here's my question.
[8471.22 --> 8476.86]  How do you do a human review in five minutes of something that used to take several hours?
[8477.40 --> 8481.34]  Unless you're just mostly going along with what the AI said.
[8481.34 --> 8481.98]  I,
[8481.98 --> 8484.88]  I don't know how realistic what I'm saying is,
[8485.00 --> 8489.84]  but I've also been reading some stuff about how the,
[8490.08 --> 8490.24]  you know,
[8490.30 --> 8490.74]  the whole,
[8490.94 --> 8491.20]  like,
[8492.48 --> 8498.10]  get a chat GPT or whatever style program to help you with the thing and then review the output before you submit.
[8499.56 --> 8501.82]  That's being followed through less these days.
[8501.82 --> 8502.30]  Well,
[8502.30 --> 8502.42]  like,
[8502.44 --> 8502.66]  yeah,
[8502.86 --> 8503.46]  dude,
[8504.54 --> 8519.46]  fixing a bad output in some cases as someone whose entire job for a lot of the last probably eight or nine years has involved a significant amount of taking other people in this case,
[8519.54 --> 8529.82]  other people's output and fixing it is actually a significantly higher mental burden than just thinking about it and putting it down for myself in the first place.
[8529.82 --> 8533.38]  Whether we're talking about script review or whether we're talking about like a,
[8533.38 --> 8537.72]  like a planning document for an event or whatever the case may be.
[8540.26 --> 8548.32]  Imagining for a second that by having the AI do the work that someone can just review it and like,
[8548.74 --> 8554.74]  and that those skills even are necessarily transferable or fully transferable is so naive.
[8555.06 --> 8556.86]  You also have to understand humans,
[8557.14 --> 8557.42]  right?
[8557.92 --> 8559.64]  Like someone's going to fall behind.
[8559.82 --> 8564.06]  And need to catch up because their boss is mad at them.
[8564.12 --> 8564.62]  Yeah.
[8564.64 --> 8567.04]  And they're feeling like they're going to lose their job.
[8567.10 --> 8568.74]  So they just start stamping things faster.
[8568.96 --> 8569.22]  Yep.
[8569.30 --> 8570.26]  Like it's,
[8570.56 --> 8574.16]  I don't like this.
[8574.30 --> 8574.68]  Um,
[8574.68 --> 8576.54]  it clearly still hallucinates.
[8576.62 --> 8578.40]  It's clearly still does.
[8579.32 --> 8586.68]  It is able to be lightly pushed into problems that are not super easy to detect if you're not really looking through stuff.
[8586.68 --> 8587.40]  Um,
[8587.60 --> 8591.48]  it's not ready for these types of scenarios.
[8591.48 --> 8603.96]  And Meta's global privacy director recently admitted during an Australian Senate inquiry that the company has been using public photos and posts on its social platforms from as far back as 2007 to train its AI models.
[8604.60 --> 8607.96]  Meta claims they only scraped accounts of users over the age of 18.
[8607.96 --> 8612.08]  Is this even news?
[8612.08 --> 8612.68]  No.
[8612.68 --> 8613.12]  Uh,
[8613.12 --> 8617.46]  and Google's notebook LM app now has a feature called audio overview,
[8617.46 --> 8623.00]  which can summarize the documents it's given to a lively bantering conversation between two AI hosts,
[8623.58 --> 8626.24]  essentially a fully automated podcast.
[8626.24 --> 8631.24]  That actually sounds completely unhinged.
[8631.24 --> 8633.84]  And I would potentially listen to the crap out of that.
[8636.46 --> 8637.46]  I would love,
[8637.56 --> 8639.30]  we should just feed the WAN document to it.
[8639.58 --> 8640.42]  See how it does.
[8640.50 --> 8640.64]  Yeah.
[8640.74 --> 8641.46]  See how it does.
[8641.58 --> 8642.60]  So accurate it is.
[8642.74 --> 8643.10]  I'd be,
[8643.26 --> 8643.66]  I'd be,
[8643.80 --> 8645.10]  I'd be actually pretty down.
[8645.30 --> 8646.96]  If you did this with the,
[8647.14 --> 8649.20]  I don't know,
[8649.26 --> 8650.82]  the automated meeting notes that you get.
[8650.82 --> 8655.78]  If you try to have something automatically take like exactly transcribe what people say from meetings,
[8655.80 --> 8656.82]  it's hilarious anyways.
[8657.08 --> 8657.34]  Yeah.
[8657.36 --> 8658.28]  It's wrong all the time.
[8658.36 --> 8658.64]  Oh yeah.
[8658.80 --> 8659.48]  They all are.
[8659.82 --> 8660.18]  100%.
[8660.18 --> 8660.34]  Oh,
[8660.44 --> 8660.64]  dude,
[8660.74 --> 8660.90]  dude,
[8660.92 --> 8661.06]  dude,
[8661.06 --> 8661.22]  dude,
[8661.22 --> 8661.40]  dude,
[8661.40 --> 8661.56]  dude,
[8661.56 --> 8661.74]  dude,
[8661.74 --> 8661.94]  dude.
[8662.38 --> 8662.78]  Oh,
[8662.88 --> 8663.36]  have I,
[8663.44 --> 8664.44]  have I shown you this?
[8665.48 --> 8665.84]  I,
[8666.12 --> 8667.24]  I got a clip.
[8668.24 --> 8668.60]  Uh,
[8669.78 --> 8671.08]  hold on.
[8671.66 --> 8672.56]  This is amazing.
[8673.68 --> 8674.04]  Oh,
[8674.06 --> 8675.08]  I should send it to Dan.
[8676.02 --> 8676.82]  Do I have it?
[8676.86 --> 8678.36]  I wiped my phone a little while ago,
[8678.36 --> 8680.72]  so I actually don't know if I have this clip on my phone anymore.
[8681.12 --> 8682.66]  I'm so upset right now.
[8683.20 --> 8683.50]  Oh,
[8683.56 --> 8684.86]  let's see if it's in to Google photos.
[8684.94 --> 8685.62]  My Google photos,
[8685.72 --> 8686.52]  a little messed up though.
[8686.56 --> 8687.90]  So things don't always sync there.
[8688.28 --> 8688.52]  Okay.
[8688.56 --> 8688.74]  Well,
[8688.82 --> 8689.40]  I do,
[8689.48 --> 8689.72]  do it,
[8689.72 --> 8690.54]  do a thing real quick.
[8690.54 --> 8691.14]  If you don't mind,
[8691.18 --> 8692.38]  I'm going to see if I can find this.
[8693.26 --> 8694.82]  Google the way back machine.
[8694.82 --> 8698.22]  When Google search deprecated its cash feature earlier this year,
[8698.58 --> 8699.32]  Google liaison,
[8699.60 --> 8706.70]  Danny Sullivan expressed a hope to compensate for the loss of the feature by linking to the way back machine.
[8706.70 --> 8707.26]  Now,
[8707.38 --> 8709.82]  according to a blog post from the internet archive,
[8709.82 --> 8711.86]  that hope is now a reality.
[8712.32 --> 8716.28]  Google likewise confirmed that search will be linking to these archived websites.
[8717.28 --> 8721.84]  Users will be able to find these results by clicking the three dots next to a particular link
[8721.84 --> 8725.80]  and searching the more about this page option on the,
[8725.80 --> 8727.98]  about this results panel,
[8727.98 --> 8731.84]  which is actually pretty cool.
[8732.02 --> 8732.78]  So that's,
[8732.86 --> 8733.58]  that's good news.
[8734.54 --> 8735.02]  Yeah,
[8735.02 --> 8736.10]  I thought that was super cool.
[8736.18 --> 8736.52]  That's cool.
[8736.52 --> 8736.82]  Um,
[8736.82 --> 8740.80]  being able to find way back machine stuff better is,
[8740.90 --> 8741.52]  is pretty,
[8741.52 --> 8743.06]  pretty excite.
[8743.74 --> 8744.14]  Um,
[8744.22 --> 8745.06]  some actually really,
[8745.12 --> 8745.58]  are you still looking?
[8745.58 --> 8747.70]  I think I found it,
[8748.30 --> 8749.54]  but I am,
[8750.04 --> 8750.16]  uh,
[8750.16 --> 8750.48]  Dan,
[8750.56 --> 8753.36]  do I have just like a standing share folder with you yet?
[8754.32 --> 8754.64]  Uh,
[8754.70 --> 8755.22]  no,
[8755.58 --> 8758.34]  but you can just send it to me on chat.
[8758.88 --> 8759.86]  If you want.
[8760.12 --> 8760.52]  Nah.
[8761.52 --> 8761.76]  All right.
[8761.76 --> 8761.92]  Well,
[8761.92 --> 8762.54]  they do that.
[8762.62 --> 8762.94]  Uh,
[8762.94 --> 8764.18]  some other really good news,
[8764.22 --> 8764.58]  actually,
[8764.68 --> 8764.96]  uh,
[8764.96 --> 8766.76]  we're all in Gaben's family.
[8766.76 --> 8770.06]  Valve is officially rolling out steam families for all users.
[8770.26 --> 8774.88]  Family allows up to six members of a household to play any game from their shared library.
[8775.24 --> 8782.98]  This includes the ability of multiple people to play multiple games from the same library at the same time or the same game.
[8782.98 --> 8785.20]  If the library contains multiple copies.
[8785.72 --> 8786.12]  So cool.
[8786.20 --> 8790.38]  The previous family sharing system blocked playing multiple games from the same library.
[8790.38 --> 8793.08]  If the owner was already playing a game,
[8793.22 --> 8794.68]  which was really inconvenient for me.
[8794.68 --> 8799.56]  Cause if I wanted to play tape to tape over in the land area and someone playing beat saber over on the TV,
[8799.56 --> 8800.26]  I couldn't,
[8800.38 --> 8801.18]  I couldn't do that.
[8801.20 --> 8804.44]  So you had to go sign in a stupid other account.
[8804.60 --> 8805.62]  It's just a pain in the butt.
[8805.70 --> 8810.52]  If you're not playing the same game at the same time and you're a family living in the same house,
[8810.52 --> 8811.70]  this totally makes sense.
[8811.88 --> 8813.12]  I love family sharing.
[8813.20 --> 8814.36]  I've been in the beta for a while.
[8814.80 --> 8815.86]  I love it.
[8815.92 --> 8816.42]  I love it.
[8816.44 --> 8816.88]  I love it.
[8816.92 --> 8817.44]  I love it.
[8817.44 --> 8817.76]  And,
[8817.76 --> 8818.16]  uh,
[8818.16 --> 8818.70]  it's great.
[8818.80 --> 8820.28]  And everything else needs it,
[8820.34 --> 8820.46]  dude.
[8820.80 --> 8821.12]  Uh,
[8821.12 --> 8821.86]  the kids wanted to,
[8822.08 --> 8822.94]  the kids want to try Anno.
[8823.52 --> 8823.88]  Yeah.
[8823.88 --> 8824.62]  And I was like,
[8825.54 --> 8827.14]  I had like logged into you play.
[8827.22 --> 8827.56]  And I'm like,
[8827.60 --> 8831.14]  these guys are so far behind.
[8832.24 --> 8832.68]  How,
[8832.88 --> 8835.98]  so what I have to log in as a parent,
[8835.98 --> 8842.44]  I have to log my kid into my Ubisoft connect account in order for them to play this game.
[8842.44 --> 8843.18]  Like the,
[8843.84 --> 8846.52]  what we've gone so far backward from discs.
[8846.66 --> 8852.04]  And then now steam has caught up to discs and then past discs and everything,
[8852.04 --> 8855.26]  but resale resale is still something we've got to solve here,
[8855.30 --> 8855.60]  valve.
[8855.68 --> 8856.44]  But like,
[8857.12 --> 8857.28]  dude,
[8857.28 --> 8857.74]  I was just,
[8857.74 --> 8858.58]  I was looking at it going,
[8858.68 --> 8858.92]  this is,
[8859.00 --> 8859.60]  this is ridiculous.
[8859.70 --> 8860.48]  It's like dinosaur.
[8860.60 --> 8860.96]  I'd rather,
[8861.30 --> 8863.94]  I'd rather they just like not bother playing the game.
[8864.32 --> 8864.78]  I like,
[8864.82 --> 8865.50]  I just don't want to,
[8865.50 --> 8867.98]  I don't want to deal with this platform at all.
[8868.66 --> 8869.26]  This is such,
[8869.36 --> 8871.70]  this is an absolute game changer for steam users.
[8872.06 --> 8873.06]  It should be noted.
[8873.18 --> 8875.20]  You can't just willy nilly change families.
[8875.74 --> 8877.22]  There's a one year cool down.
[8877.70 --> 8878.84]  So you can't just be like,
[8879.26 --> 8879.38]  yeah,
[8879.42 --> 8879.56]  yeah,
[8879.56 --> 8883.12]  I'll just like join a family and then dip and then join a different family.
[8883.12 --> 8885.84]  According to what's most convenient for our shared game library,
[8885.84 --> 8887.20]  but you also like,
[8887.26 --> 8887.60]  uh,
[8887.60 --> 8891.14]  so the next note is accounts listed as children will be unable to leave the group
[8891.14 --> 8892.62]  unless kicked out by a parent.
[8892.62 --> 8893.02]  Well,
[8893.08 --> 8894.28]  parents can leave at any time.
[8894.68 --> 8895.88]  Once a user joins a family.
[8895.88 --> 8896.90]  So if they crash the car,
[8896.98 --> 8897.24]  man,
[8897.54 --> 8898.88]  now you got real leverage.
[8899.08 --> 8900.58]  I'm going to kick you out of the steam family.
[8900.66 --> 8901.14]  No dad,
[8901.18 --> 8902.06]  I want to play the games.
[8902.46 --> 8903.74]  I wonder about that rule.
[8903.78 --> 8905.58]  Actually it says once a user joins a family,
[8905.66 --> 8908.22]  they'll have to wait a year before joining another as a,
[8908.30 --> 8911.56]  as a child of a family that.
[8912.12 --> 8912.44]  Yeah.
[8913.12 --> 8914.88]  You may have conflict with,
[8914.98 --> 8916.80]  is that weird?
[8916.92 --> 8917.92]  It seems like it might be weird.
[8918.00 --> 8919.62]  I wonder if once you're a certain age,
[8919.62 --> 8920.58]  you can just leave anyways.
[8921.18 --> 8921.66]  I don't know.
[8921.72 --> 8922.06]  Probably.
[8922.30 --> 8922.56]  Yeah.
[8922.56 --> 8922.98]  Cause you,
[8923.20 --> 8925.12]  your age is determined by your birth date anyway,
[8925.12 --> 8928.74]  not by telling it how old you are like in steam.
[8928.94 --> 8929.54]  Oh yeah.
[8929.62 --> 8930.02]  Yeah.
[8930.02 --> 8932.12]  You don't say I am 13.
[8932.30 --> 8934.54]  You say I was born in this year,
[8934.54 --> 8936.22]  so it should be fine.
[8936.90 --> 8937.04]  Yeah.
[8937.12 --> 8937.28]  Yeah.
[8938.88 --> 8939.32]  Uh,
[8939.36 --> 8939.72]  yes.
[8939.80 --> 8941.86]  Sound is very important for this video.
[8942.26 --> 8942.76]  Contact steam.
[8942.76 --> 8944.16]  They can't just do it willy nilly.
[8944.32 --> 8948.66]  I am a little worried if there's like any identifiable information in the
[8948.66 --> 8950.10]  videos or anything that needs to be blurred.
[8950.36 --> 8950.56]  Oh,
[8950.60 --> 8951.14]  what is this?
[8951.26 --> 8951.90]  Don't worry about it.
[8952.14 --> 8952.76]  Don't worry about it.
[8952.84 --> 8953.04]  Okay.
[8953.14 --> 8954.22]  Just don't worry about it.
[8954.22 --> 8954.46]  Okay.
[8956.40 --> 8956.80]  Uh,
[8956.84 --> 8957.08]  no,
[8957.12 --> 8958.28]  it looks like it should be fine.
[8959.14 --> 8960.52]  You're thinking about sharing it to stream,
[8960.62 --> 8961.68]  but I can't see what it is.
[8961.82 --> 8962.00]  Yeah.
[8962.00 --> 8962.16]  Yeah.
[8962.16 --> 8962.38]  Well,
[8962.38 --> 8963.84]  cause it's a surprise for you.
[8963.94 --> 8964.20]  Oh,
[8964.24 --> 8964.52]  okay.
[8964.64 --> 8964.80]  Yeah.
[8964.80 --> 8965.40]  It's a surprise.
[8965.62 --> 8965.96]  Okay.
[8965.96 --> 8969.00]  On my own laptop.
[8969.62 --> 8969.90]  Oh,
[8970.04 --> 8970.24]  well,
[8970.24 --> 8970.92]  I didn't think of that.
[8971.04 --> 8971.32]  Did I?
[8974.02 --> 8974.38]  Nope,
[8974.46 --> 8974.76]  nope,
[8974.82 --> 8974.94]  nope,
[8974.98 --> 8975.14]  nope.
[8975.18 --> 8976.44]  I can do it on my own laptop.
[8977.04 --> 8977.42]  Um,
[8977.42 --> 8978.78]  just makes this sound easier.
[8978.78 --> 8984.00]  this was taken in August.
[8984.44 --> 8984.88]  So,
[8985.04 --> 8988.26]  so this was taken a little over a month ago.
[8988.64 --> 8992.84]  And this basically summarizes in a nutshell,
[8992.84 --> 9002.88]  why I just completely don't believe anything I hear from Google about the usefulness of digital
[9002.88 --> 9003.30]  assistance.
[9003.30 --> 9011.44]  I've talked a fair bit about how utterly bloody useless my voices voice assistants always are
[9011.44 --> 9011.80]  for me.
[9011.90 --> 9013.74]  So no matter what the demo is,
[9013.78 --> 9018.06]  whether it's that stupid camera that was supposed to take a picture whenever it was the right
[9018.06 --> 9023.96]  time because AI or whether it's like your assistant supposed to like book an appointment
[9023.96 --> 9028.00]  for you and it's somehow at the right time and the person on the other side isn't mad
[9028.00 --> 9028.42]  about it.
[9028.50 --> 9029.62]  Just like all these things.
[9029.66 --> 9031.02]  And I hear from you guys like,
[9031.10 --> 9031.30]  oh yeah,
[9031.36 --> 9031.50]  no,
[9031.56 --> 9032.44]  like it works great for me.
[9032.44 --> 9036.44]  I'm sitting here going the amount of time you waste getting this stuff to work compared
[9036.44 --> 9040.78]  to the amount of time it would take to just call your stylist and make an appointment.
[9040.88 --> 9041.22]  I'm sorry.
[9041.32 --> 9042.38]  I just don't buy it.
[9042.50 --> 9044.78]  Assistant is a more convenient alarm setter.
[9044.88 --> 9045.48]  This is the,
[9045.66 --> 9050.52]  this is the kind of shit that I deal with just about every bloody time I try to use the thing.
[9050.58 --> 9050.76]  Okay.
[9050.80 --> 9051.46]  So Dan,
[9051.60 --> 9052.44]  do I have audio?
[9052.66 --> 9054.44]  So your laptop's currently playing something.
[9054.58 --> 9056.74]  So let's make sure that stops before we play this.
[9056.74 --> 9057.88]  Your laptop's playing something.
[9058.44 --> 9058.92]  There we go.
[9059.14 --> 9061.92]  And I'm going to turn that on and we should be able to hear it too.
[9061.92 --> 9062.72]  I hope.
[9062.88 --> 9062.98]  Yeah,
[9062.98 --> 9063.48]  go for it.
[9063.74 --> 9064.82]  You guys got audio for me?
[9065.66 --> 9065.94]  No,
[9066.02 --> 9066.74]  I don't have it here.
[9066.84 --> 9067.66]  Does Luke hear it?
[9067.74 --> 9069.16]  We should turn on C.
[9069.70 --> 9070.56]  Bingity bing bing bing.
[9070.56 --> 9071.70]  Can't hear it on C.
[9071.70 --> 9073.64]  Bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing.
[9073.64 --> 9074.00]  I'm not,
[9074.06 --> 9074.80]  I'm not hitting it anymore.
[9074.90 --> 9075.80]  I'm just making that noise.
[9075.92 --> 9076.32]  Stream does.
[9076.56 --> 9077.04]  Stream has it.
[9077.08 --> 9077.20]  Oh,
[9077.26 --> 9077.84]  stream has it.
[9077.88 --> 9078.64]  I don't know why we don't.
[9078.72 --> 9078.86]  Wait,
[9078.86 --> 9079.96]  but Luke can't hear it?
[9080.04 --> 9080.22]  Nope.
[9080.80 --> 9080.94]  Well,
[9081.02 --> 9082.94]  gosh darn it.
[9084.22 --> 9087.14]  Let's just watch Dan until he fixes it.
[9087.68 --> 9088.04]  I mean,
[9088.08 --> 9089.50]  you got to play audio or I can't.
[9089.58 --> 9089.76]  Oh,
[9089.80 --> 9090.10]  I see.
[9091.82 --> 9092.14]  Yeah,
[9092.14 --> 9092.44]  I don't know.
[9092.56 --> 9093.60]  Let's look at him very intently.
[9093.78 --> 9094.74]  Why aren't we getting it?
[9094.94 --> 9095.88]  I wanted to listen.
[9096.62 --> 9097.96]  Does it look like I'm looking at him?
[9098.00 --> 9099.26]  I'm trying to look at his portrait.
[9099.60 --> 9099.88]  Oh.
[9099.88 --> 9099.90]  Oh,
[9101.66 --> 9102.82]  we were just going to look at him.
[9102.88 --> 9103.68]  I guess we could look at him.
[9103.76 --> 9105.30]  He's like behind a monitor though.
[9105.30 --> 9106.52]  So this feels,
[9106.66 --> 9109.30]  this feels like more like if he,
[9109.40 --> 9112.34]  if he's looking at the preview of the show,
[9112.34 --> 9112.84]  then like,
[9112.88 --> 9113.84]  this is like intense.
[9113.84 --> 9114.42]  Like we're like,
[9114.94 --> 9115.32]  yeah.
[9115.46 --> 9115.76]  Yeah.
[9116.08 --> 9117.06]  We're overseeing.
[9118.18 --> 9118.54]  Micromanagement.
[9118.68 --> 9119.52]  I think I know what happened.
[9119.96 --> 9121.92]  You press that key on your keyboard slightly too slowly.
[9121.94 --> 9123.20]  See how effective this is?
[9123.54 --> 9123.84]  Yeah.
[9124.02 --> 9124.28]  He's,
[9124.38 --> 9125.74]  he's going to fix it because you know,
[9125.74 --> 9128.66]  I'm going to have to take the stream down to fix it.
[9128.90 --> 9129.12]  We can,
[9129.46 --> 9130.12]  uh,
[9130.70 --> 9131.10]  really?
[9131.26 --> 9132.78]  We probably shouldn't do that.
[9132.84 --> 9133.02]  Let me,
[9133.12 --> 9133.94]  let me see what I can do.
[9133.94 --> 9135.50]  If we go to set this to seven,
[9135.62 --> 9136.88]  we can solve all the problems.
[9137.40 --> 9138.90]  Restart to apply changes.
[9139.04 --> 9139.24]  No,
[9139.30 --> 9140.46]  I'm not going to do that.
[9140.54 --> 9141.60]  We can solve all the problems.
[9141.66 --> 9142.10]  LMG has.
[9142.16 --> 9144.30]  If we just have two managers per employee.
[9144.56 --> 9145.88]  And then they just stand over them.
[9145.98 --> 9146.18]  Yeah.
[9146.54 --> 9147.50]  It's very effective.
[9149.16 --> 9151.16]  They'd work probably twice as hard.
[9151.40 --> 9152.88]  That's what construction does.
[9152.88 --> 9155.04]  And it's very,
[9155.04 --> 9156.42]  it's very efficient.
[9156.74 --> 9157.88]  And there's never cost overruns.
[9158.66 --> 9159.74]  Construction sites,
[9159.88 --> 9160.74]  worker and friends.
[9161.36 --> 9161.60]  Uh,
[9161.66 --> 9162.92]  and to be clear,
[9162.92 --> 9163.58]  and like he said,
[9163.68 --> 9164.96]  timelines never get exceeded.
[9165.28 --> 9168.74]  No disrespect to the people who are working hard on construction sites.
[9168.86 --> 9169.34]  It just,
[9169.96 --> 9171.44]  when you drive past them,
[9171.52 --> 9172.62]  the optics aren't great.
[9173.14 --> 9173.58]  Yeah.
[9173.66 --> 9173.94]  Oh,
[9174.16 --> 9174.42]  the,
[9174.82 --> 9175.04]  honestly,
[9175.10 --> 9175.80]  the road workers,
[9175.92 --> 9180.16]  I understand almost more because a lot of the times it's the whole hurry up and wait situation.
[9180.26 --> 9180.42]  Yeah.
[9180.48 --> 9182.58]  The whole crew can't be working at the same time.
[9182.58 --> 9184.66]  You have to wait for some process to finish.
[9184.66 --> 9185.04]  But it just,
[9185.24 --> 9185.42]  you know,
[9185.46 --> 9189.68]  when you walk by and there's four people looking at the one guy in the hole who's digging,
[9189.86 --> 9190.40]  it's just like,
[9190.40 --> 9192.70]  sometimes the hole's too small and only one person can do it.
[9192.70 --> 9192.86]  Exactly.
[9192.88 --> 9193.52]  I also,
[9194.12 --> 9195.98]  and anytime people bring up that argument,
[9195.98 --> 9196.66]  it's just like,
[9196.78 --> 9196.98]  yeah.
[9196.98 --> 9200.68]  And then you go to work and sit on your darn phone anyways.
[9200.86 --> 9201.68]  Like there's,
[9201.80 --> 9202.62]  I have a solution.
[9202.98 --> 9203.80]  Assuming that.
[9204.12 --> 9205.04]  I also have a solution.
[9205.20 --> 9205.76]  On the side of the road.
[9205.90 --> 9207.82]  You just turn up your laptop speakers.
[9207.82 --> 9213.56]  Just because what you happen to be doing is inconvenienced by these workers not having been done their job already.
[9213.66 --> 9215.88]  Doesn't mean that you're also not lazy at your job sometimes.
[9216.00 --> 9216.52]  Shut up.
[9216.52 --> 9220.32]  Um,
[9220.74 --> 9221.98]  my solution is dumber.
[9221.98 --> 9225.72]  My job isn't broadcast to thousands of people.
[9227.18 --> 9227.68]  I mean,
[9227.72 --> 9227.86]  yeah,
[9227.90 --> 9228.14]  it is.
[9229.26 --> 9229.66]  Okay.
[9229.70 --> 9229.98]  Hold on,
[9230.02 --> 9230.28]  hold on,
[9230.32 --> 9230.62]  hold on,
[9230.66 --> 9230.96]  hold on.
[9231.24 --> 9231.54]  Okay.
[9231.70 --> 9232.06]  Uh,
[9232.10 --> 9233.84]  my solution is dumber than yours,
[9233.86 --> 9235.92]  but also might actually work a little bit better than yours,
[9236.04 --> 9236.08]  Dan.
[9236.44 --> 9238.54]  So I'm going to hit play at the same time.
[9238.60 --> 9238.82]  Sure.
[9238.90 --> 9242.22]  And then Luke can just listen to it slash watch it on my phone.
[9242.42 --> 9242.64]  Oh,
[9242.78 --> 9242.98]  well,
[9243.90 --> 9244.12]  you have to.
[9244.12 --> 9244.52]  Oh yeah,
[9244.52 --> 9245.56]  I guess I'll have to do it.
[9245.64 --> 9245.92]  Okay.
[9246.44 --> 9246.68]  Uh,
[9246.68 --> 9246.98]  we ready?
[9247.12 --> 9247.30]  Okay.
[9247.36 --> 9248.74]  So let's switch to Linus laptop.
[9248.88 --> 9249.04]  Oh,
[9249.18 --> 9249.42]  Dan,
[9249.50 --> 9251.14]  why are you hanging out in the middle of my car console?
[9251.52 --> 9251.86]  Okay.
[9251.94 --> 9252.38]  Here we go.
[9252.46 --> 9252.64]  One,
[9252.78 --> 9252.92]  two,
[9253.04 --> 9253.26]  three.
[9267.32 --> 9268.26]  She's right here.
[9268.26 --> 9295.84]  It's brutal that it's writing it too.
[9295.84 --> 9298.16]  That's so bad.
[9298.24 --> 9298.68]  Actually.
[9298.86 --> 9299.92]  It's writing it out.
[9299.98 --> 9300.14]  Prop.
[9300.20 --> 9301.34]  The ghostbusters was very funny.
[9301.50 --> 9304.76]  The best part is that that interface,
[9304.76 --> 9308.68]  as soon as I deactivate like the voice assistant,
[9308.96 --> 9311.40]  the top contacts thing goes away.
[9311.96 --> 9312.70]  I can't,
[9312.76 --> 9313.80]  I can't touch it.
[9314.14 --> 9315.22]  I can't touch it.
[9315.26 --> 9315.50]  I'm like,
[9315.72 --> 9317.08]  come on.
[9317.32 --> 9318.40]  While the voice thing is up.
[9318.44 --> 9319.12]  Can you touch it?
[9319.78 --> 9320.10]  Uh,
[9320.10 --> 9320.36]  no,
[9320.66 --> 9320.80]  no,
[9320.80 --> 9321.78]  it doesn't work because it,
[9321.96 --> 9323.96]  because it's an overlay.
[9323.96 --> 9324.36]  Yeah.
[9324.46 --> 9324.60]  Yeah.
[9324.60 --> 9324.74]  Yeah.
[9325.40 --> 9325.84]  Oh,
[9325.90 --> 9326.96]  that's so annoying.
[9327.84 --> 9328.26]  Dude.
[9328.38 --> 9329.20]  And to be clear,
[9329.30 --> 9333.24]  I use that function all the time and it does work a lot of the time.
[9333.28 --> 9336.10]  It works just often enough that I depend on it.
[9336.30 --> 9336.84]  And then,
[9336.90 --> 9337.90]  so when it doesn't work,
[9338.84 --> 9339.96]  it's just another,
[9340.10 --> 9342.86]  another potential double W for the old Acura.
[9343.66 --> 9344.98]  When I want to call people,
[9344.98 --> 9346.94]  I press the phone button on the steering wheel.
[9347.18 --> 9348.94]  That's me pressing the phone button on the steering wheel.
[9348.94 --> 9350.18]  And then I have a dial.
[9350.36 --> 9350.56]  Oh,
[9350.60 --> 9352.16]  it just goes through my speed dial.
[9352.16 --> 9352.78]  I actually,
[9353.14 --> 9354.70]  and I am a boring person.
[9354.92 --> 9355.62]  So honestly,
[9355.62 --> 9357.62]  the top four people in my speed dial,
[9357.76 --> 9359.00]  it's pretty much all I need.
[9359.14 --> 9359.54]  Give me your phone.
[9359.54 --> 9360.40]  And then I have a phone.
[9360.90 --> 9361.02]  Oh,
[9361.06 --> 9362.04]  it won't be through there.
[9362.72 --> 9363.74]  Am I on your speed dial?
[9363.86 --> 9364.08]  Yeah.
[9365.68 --> 9366.32]  But I mean,
[9366.36 --> 9366.62]  in my,
[9366.72 --> 9367.62]  I'm talking in my car.
[9367.74 --> 9367.86]  Car.
[9367.96 --> 9368.22]  Okay.
[9369.50 --> 9370.38]  My goodness.
[9371.76 --> 9372.14]  Look,
[9372.18 --> 9372.66]  I'm insecure.
[9372.88 --> 9373.22]  Okay.
[9373.32 --> 9375.76]  I just want to know where I stand in this relationship.
[9378.14 --> 9379.46]  The same spot.
[9380.38 --> 9381.06]  I'm number,
[9381.06 --> 9382.40]  number two suggested.
[9384.06 --> 9385.76]  After the literal GF.
[9386.56 --> 9386.96]  Nice.
[9387.44 --> 9387.90]  Hold on.
[9387.94 --> 9388.18]  Hold on.
[9388.20 --> 9388.62]  Let's see.
[9389.14 --> 9389.38]  Oh,
[9389.46 --> 9390.32]  I don't actually.
[9390.56 --> 9390.76]  Okay.
[9390.76 --> 9391.68]  So this is interesting.
[9392.48 --> 9392.88]  I,
[9393.14 --> 9394.64]  I use T9.
[9394.92 --> 9395.16]  Yeah.
[9395.22 --> 9396.62]  So you'll see the way that I,
[9396.66 --> 9396.96]  uh,
[9397.16 --> 9397.42]  the way,
[9397.42 --> 9398.78]  like when I opened my dialer,
[9398.90 --> 9401.38]  it literally just has me dialing random numbers.
[9402.04 --> 9403.26]  So with that in mind,
[9403.54 --> 9403.74]  yeah,
[9403.76 --> 9405.62]  I only have like my recents.
[9406.10 --> 9407.08]  I just clicked.
[9407.08 --> 9409.46]  Which is just 50% Yvonne.
[9409.76 --> 9412.84]  And then like some random other people you can,
[9413.00 --> 9417.50]  it's like a hilarious unknown numbers for the most part.
[9417.74 --> 9417.94]  Well,
[9417.94 --> 9418.64]  those are incoming.
[9419.08 --> 9420.42]  Oh yeah.
[9420.50 --> 9420.70]  Yeah.
[9420.70 --> 9422.14]  So if I were to,
[9422.26 --> 9423.26]  if I were to do like,
[9423.58 --> 9423.94]  uh,
[9424.00 --> 9424.78]  outgoing only,
[9424.90 --> 9427.38]  it would be probably about 80% Yvonne.
[9427.50 --> 9428.34]  I call almost no one,
[9428.38 --> 9428.86]  but my wife.
[9429.52 --> 9431.68]  I don't do like speed dial on my phone.
[9431.74 --> 9433.02]  Is there a speed dial thing?
[9433.80 --> 9434.08]  Yeah.
[9434.12 --> 9435.08]  Speed dial is still a thing.
[9435.20 --> 9436.06]  You can like,
[9436.16 --> 9436.48]  Oh yeah.
[9436.48 --> 9436.74]  Okay.
[9436.74 --> 9438.04]  I have a favorite section there.
[9438.18 --> 9438.56]  Does that,
[9438.68 --> 9439.54]  is that better?
[9439.72 --> 9440.68]  That might be even better.
[9441.48 --> 9441.88]  Dang.
[9442.32 --> 9442.56]  Okay.
[9442.56 --> 9443.22]  So it's,
[9443.22 --> 9444.06]  it's dad,
[9444.20 --> 9444.62]  brother,
[9444.88 --> 9445.40]  girlfriend,
[9445.66 --> 9446.50]  and Linus.
[9446.72 --> 9447.36]  And mom.
[9447.68 --> 9447.96]  I,
[9448.30 --> 9448.50]  uh,
[9448.50 --> 9449.10]  so the,
[9449.10 --> 9450.78]  the one that you're looking at here,
[9451.42 --> 9452.14]  um,
[9452.60 --> 9452.88]  yeah,
[9452.90 --> 9453.14]  this,
[9453.30 --> 9453.64]  this is,
[9453.78 --> 9454.30]  this is fine,
[9454.32 --> 9454.44]  right?
[9454.50 --> 9454.66]  Yep.
[9454.84 --> 9456.36]  The one that you're looking at here,
[9456.72 --> 9462.78]  I set this up when there were only about 10 to 12 people in the company.
[9463.10 --> 9464.64]  So I set it up with,
[9464.64 --> 9466.46]  um,
[9467.10 --> 9469.08]  basically you and Yvonne.
[9469.08 --> 9470.78]  And then I think it's just like alphabetical.
[9471.06 --> 9473.62]  So I still have a bunch of people that don't even work here anymore.
[9473.82 --> 9474.02]  Oh,
[9474.08 --> 9476.40]  they're in like this top contact list.
[9476.66 --> 9476.86]  Like the,
[9476.98 --> 9479.28]  I forgot there was even a favorites thing on my phone.
[9479.36 --> 9480.06]  I don't use that.
[9480.10 --> 9480.22]  Yeah.
[9480.22 --> 9480.98]  Speed dial dude.
[9481.06 --> 9481.72]  Speed dial is dead.
[9481.92 --> 9482.14]  Yeah.
[9482.20 --> 9483.94]  Like it's really easy to use.
[9484.00 --> 9485.42]  You just go like this and then assign,
[9485.52 --> 9485.84]  but I just,
[9485.96 --> 9489.18]  I'm never going to use that because I can totally just,
[9489.18 --> 9490.52]  uh,
[9490.60 --> 9490.90]  okay.
[9490.94 --> 9491.48]  I misclicked,
[9491.56 --> 9491.72]  but,
[9491.82 --> 9492.64]  but I can,
[9492.76 --> 9495.44]  I have you that quickly by just boop,
[9495.44 --> 9495.54]  boop,
[9495.54 --> 9495.64]  boop,
[9495.64 --> 9495.74]  boop,
[9495.74 --> 9495.88]  boop.
[9495.88 --> 9497.60]  Because once you have T9 memorized,
[9497.94 --> 9498.96]  it's quick.
[9499.12 --> 9501.84]  It's so fast to call people T9 dude.
[9502.46 --> 9509.16]  iOS 18 adding T9 dialing is way too much of the reason that I'm willing to try it.
[9509.74 --> 9510.62]  I believe you.
[9510.66 --> 9511.52]  I can't call people.
[9511.68 --> 9512.04]  That's like,
[9512.16 --> 9512.66]  that's like,
[9512.80 --> 9514.24]  and the only person I call is my wife.
[9514.32 --> 9514.92]  So it's stupid.
[9515.10 --> 9518.48]  That's like a phone screening for me is an actual required feature.
[9518.54 --> 9519.36]  I'm not going to switch phones.
[9519.36 --> 9520.66]  If it doesn't have phone screening at this point,
[9520.66 --> 9521.82]  which just won't happen.
[9522.00 --> 9522.24]  Yeah.
[9522.38 --> 9522.74]  Um,
[9523.38 --> 9523.62]  yeah,
[9523.70 --> 9524.16]  I don't know.
[9525.72 --> 9526.42]  Like I don't,
[9526.48 --> 9526.72]  I don't,
[9526.80 --> 9533.46]  I cannot think of a possible feature that a phone could have that is going to override my desire to have phone screening.
[9534.26 --> 9535.18]  At this point,
[9535.18 --> 9536.60]  with how many spam callers there are,
[9536.64 --> 9538.42]  I'm using phone screening like every other day.
[9538.42 --> 9554.42]  How do I say this gently?
[9558.42 --> 9564.24]  Switch to a cross platform messaging app.
[9564.84 --> 9566.46]  iMessage is not special.
[9566.46 --> 9571.20]  You're welcome.
[9571.52 --> 9573.04]  Urban Fervor said iPhones have screening.
[9573.16 --> 9573.40]  I thought,
[9573.48 --> 9573.60]  yeah,
[9573.62 --> 9574.68]  so I would consider them.
[9575.10 --> 9576.26]  I'm just saying this is,
[9576.36 --> 9576.54]  I'm not,
[9576.54 --> 9577.96]  I'm not saying there aren't alternatives.
[9578.06 --> 9580.32]  He's also saying iPhones have T9 dialing now.
[9580.42 --> 9582.64]  I'm just saying that is a required thing for me.
[9582.68 --> 9582.80]  If,
[9582.80 --> 9583.54]  if one of the brand,
[9583.62 --> 9584.90]  if pixels stopped having it,
[9584.90 --> 9586.40]  I would no longer use pixels.
[9586.84 --> 9587.88]  Just straight up.
[9591.58 --> 9592.52]  Rubber Nick says,
[9592.64 --> 9594.56]  how do you know what they are doing Linus?
[9594.56 --> 9600.22]  The fact that it matters that anyone is on Android or iOS tells me what they're doing.
[9600.46 --> 9601.06]  That's ridiculous.
[9601.32 --> 9605.52]  It's so stupid.
[9606.36 --> 9609.40]  Speed dial is not T9 recursive.
[9610.30 --> 9610.64]  T9.
[9610.64 --> 9615.20]  The amount of time I've spent arguing about T9 dialing with people who just,
[9615.34 --> 9617.54]  I think most people have literally no idea what it is.
[9617.54 --> 9620.44]  Don't understand what it is and don't want to understand what it is.
[9620.48 --> 9621.94]  I've explained it so many times.
[9622.00 --> 9622.44]  And you didn't,
[9622.54 --> 9623.70]  you don't need to,
[9624.12 --> 9625.48]  but if you don't understand what it is,
[9625.50 --> 9626.52]  don't argue about it.
[9626.54 --> 9626.86]  That's it.
[9627.92 --> 9628.54]  Someone says,
[9628.64 --> 9629.22]  what is it?
[9630.62 --> 9631.38]  Oh man.
[9631.38 --> 9631.82]  Okay.
[9632.02 --> 9632.86]  I'm going to explain it.
[9632.98 --> 9633.70]  I'll explain it.
[9633.74 --> 9634.22]  I'll explain it.
[9634.22 --> 9635.08]  I'm going to explain it again.
[9635.38 --> 9635.66]  Okay.
[9635.88 --> 9636.96]  You know how on your phone,
[9637.18 --> 9640.00]  when you open up like the dialer screen with the numbers,
[9640.00 --> 9643.02]  if you start typing someone's number,
[9643.30 --> 9643.58]  right,
[9643.94 --> 9647.48]  it'll start auto completing the rest of the number.
[9648.22 --> 9651.52]  That made a ton of sense back in the early two thousands,
[9651.78 --> 9654.48]  when people memorized phone numbers,
[9654.88 --> 9656.14]  which also no area codes.
[9656.56 --> 9656.76]  Yeah.
[9656.86 --> 9657.16]  Yeah.
[9657.30 --> 9658.94]  And phone numbers were a lot shorter.
[9658.94 --> 9660.56]  Phone numbers were seven digits.
[9660.68 --> 9661.70]  When I was a boy,
[9661.80 --> 9665.72]  we didn't need area code to dial the area code unless it was long distance.
[9666.76 --> 9667.24]  Anyway.
[9669.18 --> 9669.70]  Okay.
[9670.14 --> 9676.72]  There's another way to start dialing numbers where instead of dialing the numbers.
[9676.84 --> 9676.98]  Okay.
[9677.00 --> 9678.96]  So the two area codes here are,
[9679.22 --> 9679.26]  well,
[9679.32 --> 9681.00]  the two main ones in our area are seven,
[9681.08 --> 9681.22]  seven,
[9681.30 --> 9682.42]  eight and six Oh four.
[9682.66 --> 9683.16]  Okay.
[9683.44 --> 9685.02]  So if I dial seven,
[9685.12 --> 9685.28]  seven,
[9685.28 --> 9687.22]  eight in the modern era,
[9687.32 --> 9688.88]  that's going to auto complete.
[9688.94 --> 9690.82]  Literally half the people in my phone book.
[9691.46 --> 9692.12]  And if I type six,
[9692.20 --> 9694.02]  so it's not narrowing it down much.
[9694.10 --> 9696.48]  I've typed three numbers and it hasn't really done much.
[9696.88 --> 9698.84]  But if you look closely,
[9698.84 --> 9701.74]  and this is a remnant of a very long time ago,
[9701.74 --> 9707.04]  when it was really great for marketing to have your phone number for your business,
[9707.04 --> 9709.90]  that you would expect people to maybe memorize.
[9709.90 --> 9710.48]  I hope,
[9710.58 --> 9713.98]  because that's how people would remember phone numbers was by memorizing them.
[9713.98 --> 9718.34]  If you could have the phone number of your business correspond to a word.
[9718.86 --> 9719.40]  So say,
[9719.48 --> 9719.96]  for example,
[9719.96 --> 9723.32]  you were a business that did house cleaning,
[9723.48 --> 9727.44]  then you might want your number to be one,
[9727.58 --> 9728.38]  two clean,
[9729.14 --> 9729.48]  you know?
[9729.48 --> 9730.04]  Okay.
[9730.42 --> 9733.44]  So numbers correspond to letters.
[9733.60 --> 9734.22]  Two is ABC,
[9734.62 --> 9735.44]  three is DEF,
[9735.62 --> 9736.48]  four is GHI,
[9736.70 --> 9738.54]  and so on and so forth.
[9738.98 --> 9747.16]  So what you can do is you can dial the numbers that correspond to the name of the person you're trying to call.
[9747.22 --> 9750.02]  And it narrows it down way faster.
[9750.14 --> 9750.66]  Wicked fast.
[9750.66 --> 9754.34]  If I type 5853,
[9755.22 --> 9756.96]  that could be Luke.
[9757.40 --> 9760.14]  It could be Duke.
[9760.64 --> 9764.78]  It could be LVGD.
[9765.54 --> 9767.18]  It's probably Luke,
[9767.72 --> 9768.00]  right?
[9768.22 --> 9773.32]  So as soon as you've typed probably three numbers,
[9773.54 --> 9775.22]  at most four,
[9775.60 --> 9778.20]  unless you have an enormous contact list,
[9778.20 --> 9781.92]  you have probably surfaced the person you're trying to call.
[9782.18 --> 9783.40]  And on Samsung anyway,
[9783.82 --> 9785.90]  you can text with a swipe to the left,
[9786.00 --> 9788.00]  and you can call with a swipe to the right.
[9788.48 --> 9789.36]  So for me,
[9789.64 --> 9791.70]  being pretty fast,
[9792.34 --> 9795.64]  I can call Luke in...
[9795.64 --> 9796.18]  Okay, well here,
[9796.30 --> 9796.58]  I don't know,
[9796.66 --> 9797.26]  give me a name.
[9798.86 --> 9799.22]  Uh,
[9799.42 --> 9799.64]  Jake.
[9802.26 --> 9804.16]  That was pretty quick.
[9804.26 --> 9805.06]  I saw it come up.
[9805.26 --> 9806.20]  I didn't see the whole thing.
[9806.38 --> 9807.20]  My phone's slow,
[9807.20 --> 9808.10]  which slowed me down.
[9808.32 --> 9809.20]  But like...
[9809.20 --> 9810.12]  I said the...
[9810.12 --> 9811.40]  He typed three numbers,
[9811.58 --> 9813.04]  and then a list of people came up,
[9813.14 --> 9814.12]  and I could...
[9814.12 --> 9815.18]  I couldn't see it very clearly,
[9815.30 --> 9816.80]  but I saw Jake's profile photo.
[9816.90 --> 9817.52]  I recognize his profile.
[9817.52 --> 9819.72]  So probably in about half a second,
[9819.92 --> 9820.74]  I can call someone.
[9820.86 --> 9822.86]  It completely negates any need for me
[9822.86 --> 9824.44]  to have any kind of favorites
[9824.44 --> 9827.10]  or ever dig around in my address book.
[9827.14 --> 9829.32]  And that's the reason that it's faster,
[9829.66 --> 9832.20]  is because for whatever reason,
[9832.20 --> 9832.82]  reason,
[9833.00 --> 9834.26]  when you go to contacts,
[9834.82 --> 9837.28]  you then have to click search.
[9837.94 --> 9840.22]  You then have to start typing.
[9840.38 --> 9843.18]  It's so many more interactions with the device
[9843.18 --> 9844.58]  when what you should be doing
[9844.58 --> 9847.20]  is just dialing the numbers
[9847.20 --> 9848.32]  according to the letters,
[9848.32 --> 9850.96]  and it goes through your entire address book,
[9851.10 --> 9852.42]  which when your address book
[9852.42 --> 9854.04]  is as big as mine,
[9854.38 --> 9854.98]  um,
[9855.54 --> 9856.88]  can be a challenge.
[9856.88 --> 9858.00]  And admittedly,
[9858.00 --> 9859.34]  it's not as big as it used to be.
[9859.46 --> 9859.52]  Like,
[9859.58 --> 9860.60]  back when I was handling,
[9860.78 --> 9861.60]  um,
[9861.68 --> 9862.12]  all of,
[9862.22 --> 9862.34]  like,
[9862.40 --> 9863.44]  our brand relations
[9863.44 --> 9865.16]  on the sponsor side
[9865.16 --> 9866.56]  and product procurement
[9866.56 --> 9868.64]  and also the team
[9868.64 --> 9869.34]  and,
[9869.40 --> 9869.66]  and,
[9869.70 --> 9870.00]  and,
[9870.06 --> 9870.32]  and,
[9870.38 --> 9870.72]  and,
[9870.72 --> 9871.48]  um,
[9871.54 --> 9871.80]  you know,
[9872.20 --> 9872.48]  the,
[9872.48 --> 9873.74]  the random people
[9873.74 --> 9874.68]  that I might call,
[9874.80 --> 9875.58]  um,
[9876.02 --> 9877.30]  list was a lot longer.
[9877.30 --> 9877.58]  Like,
[9877.64 --> 9877.98]  these days,
[9878.04 --> 9878.18]  yeah,
[9878.22 --> 9879.62]  I mostly just call my wife,
[9879.72 --> 9881.68]  but I'm definitely used to it.
[9881.94 --> 9883.44]  I'm definitely used to just,
[9883.52 --> 9884.20]  you know,
[9884.22 --> 9884.56]  doing that.
[9884.58 --> 9885.88]  And you can put businesses in there too.
[9885.96 --> 9886.14]  Like,
[9886.14 --> 9887.14]  if I want to call my vet,
[9887.46 --> 9888.32]  I'll just type,
[9889.10 --> 9889.54]  uh,
[9889.62 --> 9889.78]  here,
[9889.84 --> 9890.04]  hold on.
[9890.06 --> 9891.64]  I have to close the stupid address book
[9891.64 --> 9893.26]  that I opened like a caveman.
[9893.38 --> 9894.98]  So I just type 838
[9894.98 --> 9896.30]  and boom,
[9896.38 --> 9896.98]  my vet's there,
[9897.06 --> 9898.66]  assuming that I actually put my vet
[9898.66 --> 9899.20]  in my,
[9899.24 --> 9899.52]  uh,
[9899.82 --> 9900.46]  in my address book,
[9900.50 --> 9900.72]  which I,
[9900.92 --> 9901.14]  oh,
[9901.34 --> 9901.84]  you know what?
[9901.84 --> 9902.26]  I probably,
[9902.36 --> 9903.24]  I probably did,
[9903.38 --> 9905.06]  but it's probably under,
[9905.06 --> 9906.10]  uh,
[9906.26 --> 9907.08]  Fraser Heights Animal Hospital.
[9907.18 --> 9907.54]  There you go.
[9907.70 --> 9907.96]  So,
[9908.26 --> 9908.46]  uh,
[9908.46 --> 9909.36]  3727.
[9909.70 --> 9910.36]  I don't actually,
[9910.48 --> 9911.30]  I couldn't tell you.
[9911.52 --> 9911.82]  Like,
[9911.84 --> 9913.16]  if you asked me right now,
[9913.22 --> 9913.84]  like,
[9913.84 --> 9920.08]  what is the number code for calling Dan?
[9921.12 --> 9921.60]  Dan,
[9921.94 --> 9922.50]  three,
[9922.74 --> 9923.50]  two,
[9924.42 --> 9924.76]  six.
[9925.22 --> 9926.12]  I'm going to say six.
[9927.18 --> 9927.66]  Nice.
[9928.40 --> 9928.80]  Nice.
[9929.02 --> 9930.78]  But there was like some computation there.
[9930.78 --> 9931.06]  But yeah,
[9931.08 --> 9931.36]  I don't,
[9931.44 --> 9932.98]  I don't have to think about it if I'm dialing.
[9933.04 --> 9934.58]  So it's one of those things where it's just like,
[9935.00 --> 9935.96]  if you,
[9936.22 --> 9937.18]  if it works for you,
[9937.56 --> 9938.06]  great.
[9938.68 --> 9941.04]  And if you don't want to memorize all of that bullshit,
[9941.80 --> 9942.74]  just don't.
[9943.14 --> 9944.12]  And don't care.
[9944.50 --> 9948.42]  And just not be bothered by the fact that T9 dialing is there for everybody else.
[9949.10 --> 9953.48]  Because it doesn't affect anyone other than the people who use it.
[9953.80 --> 9955.56]  It's totally fine.
[9955.56 --> 9956.66]  Uh,
[9957.32 --> 9959.10]  Jerome DeVries says,
[9959.20 --> 9960.60]  I learned about T9 dialing from you.
[9960.76 --> 9961.60]  Changed my life.
[9961.68 --> 9962.50]  Best tech tip ever.
[9962.74 --> 9963.00]  DeVries.
[9963.28 --> 9963.44]  Yeah.
[9963.52 --> 9963.88]  It's just,
[9964.00 --> 9964.40]  it just,
[9964.48 --> 9966.12]  it drives me bananas.
[9966.74 --> 9967.14]  Um,
[9968.30 --> 9969.86]  when I'll explain it like this,
[9969.86 --> 9971.58]  and then people will look back at me like,
[9972.86 --> 9974.48]  a stupid.
[9975.34 --> 9975.68]  I was like,
[9975.70 --> 9975.90]  no,
[9975.98 --> 9976.80]  it's not stupid.
[9976.88 --> 9977.94]  It just doesn't matter.
[9978.28 --> 9979.06]  It's not for you.
[9979.06 --> 9979.90]  And that's fine,
[9979.90 --> 9980.86]  but it isn't stupid.
[9981.62 --> 9982.02]  Yeah.
[9982.10 --> 9982.94]  I don't use it.
[9982.98 --> 9983.80]  I think it's cool.
[9983.80 --> 9986.26]  I think if you're a person who's like invested in it,
[9986.30 --> 9986.52]  it's,
[9986.62 --> 9987.76]  it's pretty sweet.
[9988.30 --> 9988.74]  I,
[9988.94 --> 9993.06]  there are definitely use cases where I think it would be kind of nice,
[9993.06 --> 9996.56]  but looking at my phone and the people that I call,
[9996.72 --> 9999.76]  I don't call that many people.
[10000.22 --> 10001.78]  The favorites tab is fine.
[10001.78 --> 10002.20]  And honestly,
[10002.20 --> 10003.06]  I don't even use that.
[10003.16 --> 10005.40]  I can pretty much just operate out of recent.
[10005.86 --> 10006.34]  Oh,
[10006.68 --> 10007.26]  dude,
[10007.46 --> 10011.06]  especially in my car when I can't rely on my voice dialing.
[10011.18 --> 10013.44]  Recent is like a godsend.
[10013.44 --> 10015.56]  Cause I'm usually trying to call Yvonne anyway.
[10015.90 --> 10017.14]  In my car,
[10017.28 --> 10017.50]  the,
[10017.68 --> 10019.56]  the top contact is Emma.
[10019.98 --> 10020.42]  Yeah.
[10020.50 --> 10023.16]  To call her in my car is yeah,
[10023.34 --> 10027.30]  probably half a second because I I'll move both hands simultaneously.
[10027.60 --> 10032.56]  I'll press the phone button on the steering wheel and then just enter on the
[10032.56 --> 10033.98]  middle of the like dial thing.
[10033.98 --> 10035.00]  Cause she's the first one.
[10035.08 --> 10036.30]  And when you press phone,
[10036.32 --> 10037.46]  it goes directly to the favorite.
[10037.56 --> 10038.68]  So it's just like calling.
[10038.90 --> 10039.38]  Nice.
[10039.84 --> 10040.32]  Amazing.
[10041.26 --> 10043.88]  And then if it's basically you or anyone in my family,
[10043.88 --> 10046.24]  it's just like one or two dial clicks and then enter.
[10046.36 --> 10046.96]  And it's right there.
[10047.06 --> 10047.40]  Like,
[10047.44 --> 10047.66]  okay,
[10047.66 --> 10047.94]  cool.
[10048.30 --> 10052.48]  So we cack who asks silly question is Taryn eligible for the $5,000 tech
[10052.48 --> 10053.06]  upgrade series.
[10053.20 --> 10055.92]  I don't think execs are eligible.
[10055.92 --> 10056.60]  At least not anymore.
[10056.66 --> 10057.44]  We did Colton though.
[10057.46 --> 10059.32]  And we did Yvonne come to think of it.
[10059.86 --> 10061.00]  Are execs eligible?
[10061.00 --> 10063.78]  I think some have opted out.
[10065.38 --> 10066.76]  I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[10067.26 --> 10068.32]  I don't know how it works.
[10068.70 --> 10070.00]  All I know is that the,
[10070.76 --> 10074.06]  the float plane peeps are.
[10074.42 --> 10075.28]  Elijah says they're eligible.
[10079.60 --> 10081.42]  If I ever get pulled,
[10081.60 --> 10083.54]  I'm taping Elijah to a pole.
[10083.64 --> 10085.86]  So he can't do anything in my house.
[10086.32 --> 10087.48]  I wouldn't blame you.
[10087.48 --> 10090.40]  We could actually just have like an Elijah cam.
[10090.74 --> 10090.94]  Yeah.
[10091.18 --> 10091.34]  Sure.
[10091.46 --> 10094.12]  That would just be in the corner of the entire video.
[10094.26 --> 10096.96]  So it would show what Elijah was doing taped to the pole.
[10097.02 --> 10100.78]  We could have his arms not taped down and we could give him like little
[10100.78 --> 10102.30]  puzzles or something to play with.
[10102.92 --> 10103.32]  Yeah.
[10103.50 --> 10104.76]  Or like little finger puppets.
[10104.94 --> 10105.10]  Sure.
[10105.74 --> 10106.14]  And then,
[10106.22 --> 10109.68]  and then we can make sure there's a monitor nearby with like subway surfers.
[10109.74 --> 10112.08]  So he can just have like,
[10112.50 --> 10112.78]  you know,
[10112.84 --> 10113.24]  distractions.
[10113.24 --> 10114.98]  So he doesn't just like start tweaking out.
[10115.14 --> 10115.28]  Yeah.
[10115.84 --> 10116.66]  We're having withdrawals.
[10117.26 --> 10117.40]  Yeah.
[10117.84 --> 10118.28]  That's good.
[10119.68 --> 10120.08]  Elijah,
[10120.16 --> 10120.62]  we got you.
[10120.74 --> 10121.46]  We're thinking about,
[10121.58 --> 10122.30]  we're thinking of you.
[10122.44 --> 10123.38]  We'll make sure it's comfortable.
[10124.58 --> 10125.00]  Uh,
[10125.06 --> 10125.28]  okay.
[10125.36 --> 10126.72]  What else are we supposed to be talking about?
[10126.72 --> 10127.06]  Okay.
[10127.14 --> 10127.46]  Yeah.
[10127.58 --> 10128.56]  Subway surfers.
[10129.06 --> 10129.68]  Oh God.
[10129.88 --> 10130.12]  He's,
[10130.12 --> 10130.64]  he's in now.
[10130.72 --> 10130.94]  He's,
[10131.02 --> 10131.28]  he's,
[10131.34 --> 10131.56]  he's,
[10131.56 --> 10134.24]  there are two more topics left.
[10134.24 --> 10134.68]  Uh,
[10134.74 --> 10136.54]  long form videos in the shorts feed.
[10136.78 --> 10140.72]  Somebody on the subreddit posted a screenshot of a long form YouTube video
[10140.72 --> 10142.26]  being displayed as a short.
[10142.26 --> 10142.86]  According,
[10143.14 --> 10144.64]  according to Google support page,
[10144.64 --> 10149.32]  they are conducting a few experiments with the watch page to increase discoverability
[10149.32 --> 10150.40]  across channels,
[10150.58 --> 10150.92]  formats,
[10151.00 --> 10152.28]  and lengths of YouTube,
[10152.44 --> 10154.06]  which could mix,
[10154.18 --> 10155.88]  could include a mix of video formats,
[10156.10 --> 10158.70]  including long form videos where you'd normally see shorts.
[10158.70 --> 10164.16]  Kind of weird.
[10164.50 --> 10165.32]  I get the motivation.
[10165.52 --> 10166.16]  I get it too.
[10166.26 --> 10167.40]  There's no money in shorts.
[10167.76 --> 10167.98]  Yeah.
[10168.04 --> 10168.82]  Not for creators,
[10168.94 --> 10169.64]  not for YouTube.
[10169.90 --> 10170.14]  It's,
[10170.14 --> 10171.44]  it's very small.
[10171.44 --> 10172.10]  Like we did that.
[10172.16 --> 10177.32]  We had that short a couple of weeks ago that did like eight or nine million views on that
[10177.32 --> 10179.64]  little like underwater scooter magic thing.
[10180.24 --> 10185.24]  And compared to a long form video that did that kind of viewership to be clear,
[10185.24 --> 10188.50]  it's really hard to get that kind of viewership on a long form video by comparison,
[10188.50 --> 10191.74]  but compared to a long form video that did those kinds of numbers,
[10192.26 --> 10194.50]  like a fraction.
[10194.50 --> 10195.04]  It was like,
[10195.10 --> 10195.82]  I think the,
[10195.90 --> 10200.42]  I think the monetization rate is like a 20th or a 30th or a 40th or something like that.
[10200.44 --> 10200.98]  Like it's some,
[10201.04 --> 10202.88]  it's some tiny,
[10203.00 --> 10204.24]  tiny amount by comparison.
[10204.46 --> 10205.26]  And so,
[10205.60 --> 10205.82]  sorry,
[10206.24 --> 10206.66]  I thought you're done.
[10206.80 --> 10207.28]  So I can,
[10207.36 --> 10214.40]  I can see them wanting to convert shorts viewers to a longer video watching session.
[10214.40 --> 10219.24]  I don't know that having letter boxing and pillar boxing or whatever,
[10219.62 --> 10221.84]  or like gigantic letter boxing,
[10221.94 --> 10223.02]  I guess is how it shows up.
[10223.10 --> 10224.98]  I don't know that that's the solution,
[10225.26 --> 10225.44]  but,
[10225.54 --> 10225.86]  um,
[10226.04 --> 10227.62]  that's my biggest pushback to be honest.
[10227.90 --> 10229.00]  The formatting is weird.
[10229.10 --> 10230.22]  I can see why they want to do it.
[10230.26 --> 10232.74]  And I can see why creators would be interested in it as well,
[10232.74 --> 10237.90]  because short form content is very much seen as a funnel somewhere else,
[10237.90 --> 10241.18]  whether it's to your courses that you offer to your merch,
[10241.30 --> 10242.92]  to your long form videos,
[10242.92 --> 10245.32]  almost nobody sees it as,
[10245.62 --> 10246.00]  um,
[10246.08 --> 10246.54]  or like,
[10246.88 --> 10247.26]  uh,
[10247.26 --> 10248.76]  something that gets a lot of eyeballs.
[10248.88 --> 10250.98]  So you can sell sponsorships or product placements.
[10250.98 --> 10255.40]  Like almost nobody is treating shorts like the end.
[10255.48 --> 10255.86]  Yeah.
[10255.88 --> 10256.66]  It's a means.
[10256.86 --> 10257.04]  Yeah.
[10257.70 --> 10258.04]  Uh,
[10258.04 --> 10260.52]  Elijah pointed out short to long conversion is so bad though,
[10260.58 --> 10261.26]  less than 1%.
[10261.26 --> 10262.22]  So that's true.
[10262.30 --> 10264.14]  And I don't think that's at all surprising.
[10264.14 --> 10266.24]  If you look at how the mechanism of shorts works,
[10266.32 --> 10267.66]  it's not really designed for that.
[10267.78 --> 10268.56]  I think is the idea.
[10268.68 --> 10269.02]  Yes.
[10269.06 --> 10269.88]  There are also,
[10269.88 --> 10270.80]  if you look into it,
[10270.82 --> 10277.54]  some really interesting strategies being employed by creators to improve their short to long conversion.
[10277.54 --> 10279.52]  And I promise you,
[10279.60 --> 10282.38]  there are certain creators that have way higher conversion rates than that.
[10282.54 --> 10285.90]  I also think there's other forms of conversion rate.
[10285.96 --> 10290.16]  Like one of the most interesting short strategies that I've seen is,
[10290.16 --> 10290.94]  uh,
[10290.94 --> 10292.68]  a creator who,
[10292.68 --> 10296.40]  they didn't take a slice out of their video.
[10297.04 --> 10299.14]  It's a genuinely unique piece of content,
[10299.14 --> 10305.16]  but it's related to an upcoming video and it's really interesting.
[10305.26 --> 10306.30]  And it makes you want to know more.
[10306.30 --> 10308.08]  And then that video comes out.
[10308.18 --> 10309.62]  So they use it as a trailer,
[10309.84 --> 10312.08]  like hours later or a day later.
[10312.20 --> 10312.84]  So yeah,
[10312.84 --> 10320.10]  it's basically a trailer and you won't see any conversion on that effectively because there's nothing for them to go to watch.
[10320.10 --> 10321.88]  But it,
[10321.96 --> 10328.88]  it might give you a stronger click through rate on that first notification because these viewers are primed to be interested in this piece of content.
[10328.98 --> 10329.26]  Got it.
[10329.38 --> 10331.12]  And then they see that content follow through.
[10331.26 --> 10332.48]  Really interesting idea.
[10332.74 --> 10337.94]  There's a bunch of interesting angles that creators are taking.
[10338.36 --> 10338.70]  Um,
[10339.14 --> 10339.42]  but.
[10339.68 --> 10340.26]  Nokia asks,
[10340.34 --> 10343.66]  didn't you guys get sponsored by Nexigo to make shorts answering people's tech questions?
[10343.88 --> 10346.78]  How's that sponsorship revenue compared to full video sponsorship?
[10347.58 --> 10348.02]  Um,
[10348.18 --> 10350.08]  I don't know how much they paid.
[10350.60 --> 10350.94]  Uh,
[10350.94 --> 10362.14]  but I would assume that it is less than like full length videos like VODs and more than if we just uploaded shorts without any sponsorship.
[10362.96 --> 10363.44]  Uh,
[10364.60 --> 10364.86]  we,
[10364.98 --> 10366.94]  we uploaded a short yesterday,
[10367.82 --> 10368.00]  I think.
[10368.06 --> 10368.28]  Oh no,
[10368.36 --> 10369.70]  today we uploaded a short today.
[10369.76 --> 10370.74]  That's actually doing pretty good.
[10371.16 --> 10371.94]  It's a,
[10372.04 --> 10372.46]  um,
[10373.88 --> 10376.82]  it's reacting to the cardboard laptop.
[10376.82 --> 10377.48]  Oh yeah.
[10377.66 --> 10377.90]  Yeah.
[10377.96 --> 10378.78]  Evan and Caitlin made.
[10380.10 --> 10380.92]  met the mat,
[10380.96 --> 10381.54]  matpats,
[10381.70 --> 10382.10]  uh,
[10382.10 --> 10382.80]  retirement party.
[10383.14 --> 10383.92]  I almost said funeral.
[10384.44 --> 10385.04]  He's alive.
[10385.80 --> 10386.44]  As far as I know.
[10386.84 --> 10387.10]  Ah,
[10387.56 --> 10388.46]  yeah.
[10388.66 --> 10389.66]  Oh my goodness.
[10390.14 --> 10390.32]  Yeah.
[10390.52 --> 10392.36]  Just ominously add that at the end of all.
[10392.36 --> 10394.66]  It's my best.
[10394.76 --> 10395.12]  For now.
[10395.12 --> 10395.68]  For now.
[10396.88 --> 10399.62]  Another 80 years maybe.
[10401.06 --> 10401.98]  Oh my goodness.
[10402.20 --> 10402.70]  Um,
[10403.14 --> 10404.58]  yeah,
[10404.58 --> 10405.12]  that's cool though.
[10405.40 --> 10405.80]  That's good.
[10406.14 --> 10406.40]  Yep.
[10406.50 --> 10407.00]  Good job team.
[10407.00 --> 10411.16]  Is Uber engaging in pay discrimination.
[10411.96 --> 10413.70]  Nonprofit news organization,
[10414.22 --> 10421.38]  More Perfect Union recently conducted an experiment where they brought together several Uber and Lyft drivers and had them log into,
[10421.64 --> 10425.62]  log into a shift and place their phones next to each other on a table.
[10425.62 --> 10433.98]  They found that the drivers were consistently offered different pay for the same jobs with Lyft price swings being the most drastic.
[10434.64 --> 10439.12]  Sometimes this variation was only a few cents difference, but it could also vary by as much as $3.
[10439.12 --> 10440.00]  Wow.
[10440.80 --> 10443.30]  Due to the black box nature of Uber's algorithm,
[10443.62 --> 10446.82]  it is unclear why any given driver was offered different pay.
[10447.28 --> 10448.84]  According to an Uber blog post,
[10449.08 --> 10451.26]  upfront pay may be affected by GPS location,
[10451.40 --> 10452.18]  estimated arrival time,
[10452.26 --> 10452.82]  promotional offers,
[10452.98 --> 10455.96]  and surge heat maps that refresh every few seconds.
[10456.46 --> 10456.80]  However,
[10457.32 --> 10461.54]  these should have been largely accounted for by having all of the drivers in the same place at the same time.
[10462.04 --> 10462.46]  However,
[10462.74 --> 10466.58]  this pay may also vary depending on tests that are being run by Uber.
[10466.58 --> 10468.20]  Our discussion question is,
[10468.28 --> 10469.34]  is this pay discrimination?
[10469.82 --> 10476.02]  And what is the likelihood that Uber can or is using this system to minimize driver pay?
[10476.52 --> 10477.58]  That second part,
[10477.98 --> 10479.00]  100%.
[10479.00 --> 10481.30]  As for whether it's pay discrimination,
[10481.64 --> 10487.82]  that's harder to say because they would have to prove that they're discriminating based on some kind of protected attribute of the drivers.
[10488.12 --> 10488.16]  Also,
[10488.28 --> 10490.42]  are these drivers all the same rating?
[10490.66 --> 10494.02]  Is rating allowed to play into their income?
[10494.30 --> 10495.36]  Does it play into their income?
[10495.36 --> 10497.86]  Is it just a way to get kicked out of the program?
[10497.96 --> 10498.36]  Basically,
[10498.54 --> 10503.04]  there's a lot of questions to ask here.
[10503.60 --> 10504.92]  I just thought it was interesting.
[10505.04 --> 10506.30]  It's interesting that there's variance.
[10506.58 --> 10506.76]  Yeah.
[10506.76 --> 10507.14]  I mean,
[10507.14 --> 10509.72]  it makes sense that if they're going to play around with the rate that you pay,
[10509.80 --> 10511.86]  they're also going to play around with the rates that they pay.
[10512.06 --> 10512.28]  Totally.
[10512.46 --> 10519.26]  And I would absolutely see them using this to minimize the amount that they pay while maximizing the amount that they extract.
[10519.42 --> 10519.68]  I mean,
[10519.68 --> 10521.26]  that's literally the name of the game.
[10521.44 --> 10522.42]  That's how business works.
[10523.00 --> 10523.16]  Yeah.
[10523.16 --> 10524.34]  Hey,
[10524.44 --> 10525.20]  float plane updates.
[10525.54 --> 10526.38]  Speaking of business.
[10526.58 --> 10526.88]  Yeah.
[10527.02 --> 10529.20]  Have you ever wondered why the WAN show is late all the time?
[10530.14 --> 10530.96]  To answer that,
[10531.02 --> 10531.52]  oh my God,
[10531.54 --> 10533.04]  this is a monthly series.
[10533.68 --> 10534.04]  Apparently.
[10535.10 --> 10536.44]  To answer that question.
[10536.54 --> 10537.32]  People like the first one.
[10537.32 --> 10549.68]  We have a monthly series called Why is WAN Late that just launched yesterday and is apparently already beloved.
[10549.68 --> 10551.56]  So,
[10551.56 --> 10560.54]  Sammy has been going around in the lead up to WAN show and talking to people about what's going on in the lead up to WAN show,
[10560.72 --> 10562.20]  especially when we are late.
[10562.74 --> 10564.92]  And there's some pretty good behind the scenes.
[10565.04 --> 10568.26]  You can kind of see what it's like on a Friday around here.
[10568.40 --> 10568.72]  This is,
[10568.78 --> 10569.48]  this is pretty old.
[10569.54 --> 10570.24]  This is from,
[10570.24 --> 10571.58]  I mean,
[10571.60 --> 10571.76]  yeah,
[10571.76 --> 10573.14]  obviously when you were at,
[10573.14 --> 10573.58]  um,
[10573.90 --> 10574.28]  DEFCON.
[10574.40 --> 10574.52]  Yeah.
[10574.56 --> 10574.90]  DEFCON.
[10574.98 --> 10575.12]  Yeah.
[10575.12 --> 10578.76]  And you're getting a fair bit of gray in the beard.
[10579.12 --> 10579.62]  Oh yeah.
[10580.16 --> 10580.56]  Dang.
[10580.82 --> 10581.06]  Yeah.
[10581.10 --> 10582.08]  Not the hair so much.
[10582.20 --> 10582.44]  Yeah.
[10582.56 --> 10583.34]  The beard for sure.
[10583.42 --> 10583.56]  Well,
[10583.58 --> 10585.16]  you have a really favorable,
[10585.16 --> 10586.02]  um,
[10586.02 --> 10587.78]  hair color to hide it.
[10587.96 --> 10588.40]  Oh yeah.
[10589.46 --> 10592.06]  Like my gray has been coming in for a while,
[10592.06 --> 10595.84]  but because I have a little bit of like blonde highlighting,
[10595.84 --> 10597.20]  it's been hard to,
[10597.20 --> 10597.78]  hard to,
[10597.78 --> 10598.34]  uh,
[10598.44 --> 10598.98]  hard to tell.
[10599.30 --> 10600.78]  It's pretty obvious now though.
[10600.92 --> 10601.86]  I don't care.
[10603.08 --> 10604.56]  I thought I was going to be bald.
[10605.12 --> 10605.44]  Yeah,
[10605.46 --> 10605.92]  me too.
[10606.00 --> 10606.62]  I'll take it,
[10606.80 --> 10607.18]  dude.
[10607.38 --> 10609.32]  I'm so stoked to have gray hair.
[10609.60 --> 10612.52]  Like you're apparently supposed to look to the men on your mother's side.
[10612.80 --> 10612.96]  Yeah.
[10613.02 --> 10613.84]  I didn't know that dude.
[10613.90 --> 10615.66]  My grandpa went bald in high school.
[10615.88 --> 10616.00]  Oh,
[10616.04 --> 10617.32]  my grandpa had hair the whole time.
[10617.40 --> 10617.68]  Okay.
[10617.74 --> 10618.32]  Then yeah,
[10618.32 --> 10618.98]  I didn't,
[10619.04 --> 10619.74]  I didn't know that though.
[10619.76 --> 10620.86]  So I just look at my dad and be like,
[10620.90 --> 10621.04]  well,
[10621.30 --> 10623.32]  like I had written off having hair.
[10623.54 --> 10625.84]  I assumed by the time I was like 25,
[10626.14 --> 10626.74]  I'd be.
[10627.36 --> 10627.68]  Yeah.
[10628.08 --> 10628.40]  Gone.
[10628.66 --> 10628.94]  Yep.
[10629.36 --> 10630.68]  And I didn't care about that.
[10630.94 --> 10631.66]  Which to be clear.
[10631.72 --> 10631.88]  Yeah.
[10631.90 --> 10632.46]  It's fine.
[10632.62 --> 10632.82]  Yeah.
[10632.82 --> 10633.20]  I was like,
[10633.26 --> 10633.54]  whatever.
[10633.70 --> 10634.66]  I guess that'll happen.
[10634.66 --> 10635.94]  I guess I could pick it.
[10637.14 --> 10637.72]  Seriously though.
[10637.86 --> 10638.06]  Yeah.
[10638.10 --> 10638.52]  There's so,
[10638.60 --> 10639.86]  there's so many bald dudes.
[10640.00 --> 10640.94]  I don't know who cares.
[10641.06 --> 10642.74]  And then when I figured out like that,
[10642.74 --> 10643.42]  isn't happening,
[10644.12 --> 10646.02]  it was like fairly neutral,
[10646.02 --> 10646.42]  I guess.
[10646.42 --> 10648.82]  Cause I had accepted it so much that I was just like,
[10648.88 --> 10649.20]  whatever.
[10649.30 --> 10650.24]  And now it's like,
[10650.28 --> 10650.42]  Oh,
[10650.44 --> 10651.56]  I guess I'll have it,
[10651.62 --> 10652.42]  but it'll be gray.
[10652.94 --> 10653.64]  That's fine.
[10653.76 --> 10654.24]  I don't know.
[10654.30 --> 10654.64]  I just,
[10654.74 --> 10655.12]  I don't,
[10655.12 --> 10655.98]  I don't care.
[10656.14 --> 10656.28]  Yeah.
[10656.32 --> 10657.16]  Some people.
[10657.50 --> 10659.98]  Some people get really like self-conscious about it.
[10659.98 --> 10660.28]  Really,
[10660.42 --> 10660.92]  really,
[10661.04 --> 10661.34]  really,
[10661.34 --> 10662.42]  really into it.
[10662.42 --> 10666.54]  Like I was quite taken aback when I was on Ludwig stream and he goes,
[10667.70 --> 10668.36]  hairline check,
[10668.60 --> 10669.24]  hairline check.
[10669.32 --> 10669.80]  And I'm like,
[10670.56 --> 10671.72]  like he does that with his,
[10671.78 --> 10673.10]  he does that with his stream,
[10673.10 --> 10674.54]  like very regularly.
[10674.54 --> 10676.52]  And then he's like,
[10677.08 --> 10677.32]  Oh,
[10677.38 --> 10677.58]  you're,
[10677.58 --> 10679.82]  you're doing pretty good for 37.
[10680.56 --> 10681.44]  Are you on the,
[10681.48 --> 10682.64]  are you on the finasteride?
[10682.86 --> 10683.38]  And I'm like,
[10683.42 --> 10683.58]  sorry,
[10683.64 --> 10684.06]  what is that?
[10684.16 --> 10684.70]  What even is that?
[10684.70 --> 10686.96]  I only know what it is because we had this conversation.
[10686.96 --> 10687.70]  It's like a,
[10687.70 --> 10689.04]  a hair thinning drug.
[10689.98 --> 10691.50]  I thought mine was worse.
[10693.32 --> 10693.68]  Well,
[10693.78 --> 10694.78]  it's mostly here.
[10695.22 --> 10697.66]  It's mostly here that it's going to recede more.
[10698.46 --> 10699.20]  So yeah,
[10699.22 --> 10699.66]  you could see,
[10699.66 --> 10700.62]  you could see I'm definitely,
[10700.62 --> 10701.76]  I'm definitely receding,
[10702.10 --> 10703.30]  but yeah,
[10704.54 --> 10705.20]  I don't know.
[10705.72 --> 10706.24]  It's just,
[10706.46 --> 10706.84]  uh,
[10707.06 --> 10711.80]  I think like I respected my dad the whole time I was growing up.
[10711.88 --> 10714.16]  My dad was bald the whole time I was growing up.
[10714.16 --> 10714.78]  So I just,
[10714.90 --> 10716.06]  I never cared at all.
[10717.04 --> 10717.44]  Yeah.
[10719.22 --> 10720.80]  Apparently that drug can be dangerous.
[10720.80 --> 10721.20]  So I'm,
[10721.24 --> 10722.18]  I'm not endorsing it.
[10722.38 --> 10723.46]  It wasn't an endorsement.
[10723.52 --> 10723.76]  Yep.
[10724.36 --> 10724.58]  Like,
[10724.60 --> 10726.02]  I don't even know if it's legal in Canada.
[10726.02 --> 10729.22]  There's all kinds of drugs in the States that like are not a thing up here.
[10729.26 --> 10729.52]  Yeah.
[10729.88 --> 10730.52]  Supplements too.
[10730.74 --> 10731.18]  Anyway,
[10731.46 --> 10731.82]  uh,
[10731.82 --> 10733.30]  it follows both Linus and Luke.
[10733.30 --> 10734.54]  Um,
[10734.60 --> 10738.10]  after 4 30 PM and we're even tracking who's the latest.
[10738.10 --> 10739.22]  So go check it out.
[10739.32 --> 10741.88]  We're also bringing back another special week on float plane.
[10742.04 --> 10742.76]  Riley week.
[10743.22 --> 10743.38]  Uh,
[10743.46 --> 10746.50]  Riley week will go live with a few specials centered around Riley.
[10746.58 --> 10747.22]  That's gotta be fun.
[10747.30 --> 10748.14]  More about it next week.
[10748.14 --> 10750.26]  And maybe even show a little teaser of what's to come.
[10750.26 --> 10754.64]  So make sure you guys are subscribed to float plane.
[10755.24 --> 10756.76]  And now it's time for when after dark.
[10757.08 --> 10757.44]  Yeah.
[10758.04 --> 10758.32]  Dan,
[10758.32 --> 10759.60]  do you want to change the color scheme?
[10761.94 --> 10762.90]  He's got this.
[10763.16 --> 10764.02]  I believe in Dan.
[10769.14 --> 10769.62]  Nice.
[10769.86 --> 10770.26]  Nice.
[10770.62 --> 10770.90]  Nice.
[10770.90 --> 10771.46]  And after dark.
[10771.62 --> 10771.80]  Nice.
[10771.94 --> 10772.26]  Nice.
[10772.38 --> 10772.78]  Nice.
[10773.32 --> 10773.76]  Nice.
[10774.00 --> 10774.42]  Nice.
[10775.30 --> 10775.74]  Nice.
[10775.94 --> 10776.26]  Nice.
[10776.26 --> 10777.26]  Nice.
[10777.26 --> 10778.26]  Nice.
[10778.26 --> 10779.94]  And it would be nice.
[10780.76 --> 10781.58]  Some merge messages.
[10781.82 --> 10781.94]  Yeah.
[10781.94 --> 10782.14]  Yeah.
[10782.86 --> 10785.98]  Do we go back to the way we started the show and be all gentle and soft?
[10786.20 --> 10786.38]  Nope.
[10787.34 --> 10787.60]  Hi,
[10787.68 --> 10787.92]  Linus,
[10788.00 --> 10788.46]  Luke and Dan.
[10788.46 --> 10788.62]  Hi,
[10788.62 --> 10789.08]  Lil K.
[10789.08 --> 10791.46]  I moved last weekend and in the confusion,
[10791.60 --> 10792.76]  the movers stole my PC.
[10793.00 --> 10795.06]  Have you had any PCs stolen?
[10795.48 --> 10797.44]  How do you prevent theft in such cases?
[10798.34 --> 10799.84]  I had a pocket PC stolen.
[10800.80 --> 10801.58]  It's kind of my fault.
[10801.68 --> 10803.14]  I left it behind in a nice rink.
[10803.48 --> 10803.72]  Oh.
[10804.72 --> 10805.80]  And then when I went back,
[10805.84 --> 10806.96]  it wasn't there anymore.
[10807.08 --> 10807.36]  And that,
[10807.54 --> 10807.70]  yeah,
[10807.78 --> 10808.46]  them's the brakes.
[10808.92 --> 10811.92]  And that was pre like pins.
[10812.06 --> 10812.84]  Like literally the,
[10812.96 --> 10814.16]  if the battery died on that device,
[10814.16 --> 10815.30]  it completely factory reset.
[10815.60 --> 10816.32]  Like it was just,
[10816.60 --> 10816.72]  yeah,
[10816.86 --> 10817.32]  that was,
[10817.44 --> 10818.22]  that was a real thing,
[10818.30 --> 10818.64]  by the way,
[10818.64 --> 10819.26]  that was terrible.
[10820.76 --> 10821.16]  Yep.
[10821.46 --> 10821.74]  Yep.
[10822.02 --> 10822.44]  I,
[10822.50 --> 10824.30]  I don't think I've ever had a,
[10825.30 --> 10826.12]  I don't think I've ever.
[10826.82 --> 10827.22]  Oh,
[10827.42 --> 10828.12]  uh,
[10828.48 --> 10828.76]  okay.
[10828.76 --> 10830.72]  I think this isn't what you mean,
[10830.72 --> 10832.76]  but like we've had equipment stolen,
[10833.66 --> 10835.90]  but not like my computer.
[10836.38 --> 10836.86]  Yeah.
[10836.86 --> 10837.74]  I've been very,
[10837.96 --> 10838.74]  I've been very lucky.
[10839.26 --> 10839.74]  Yeah.
[10839.82 --> 10840.02]  I,
[10840.14 --> 10840.60]  uh,
[10840.60 --> 10842.16]  I have never had one stolen.
[10842.28 --> 10843.76]  I do take measures.
[10844.82 --> 10845.30]  Um,
[10845.98 --> 10846.26]  you know,
[10846.32 --> 10848.20]  general house security is one.
[10848.20 --> 10850.04]  That's not going to help you when movers take it.
[10850.10 --> 10853.80]  So I have no real tips for stopping the movers from taking it.
[10853.84 --> 10854.08]  That's,
[10854.20 --> 10855.22]  that's a rough one.
[10855.52 --> 10855.96]  Um,
[10855.96 --> 10857.76]  when I'm traveling with like laptops and stuff,
[10857.88 --> 10858.80]  um,
[10859.36 --> 10861.44]  even if I'm not tired,
[10861.44 --> 10863.60]  if I'm just like sitting down in an airport,
[10863.60 --> 10864.44]  I never like,
[10864.44 --> 10872.00]  I don't like just put my bag on the seat next to me because there's a chance I'll look this way and it will be to my back.
[10872.00 --> 10874.10]  And so I might just take it and walk away and I might not notice.
[10874.72 --> 10875.12]  Um,
[10875.46 --> 10878.86]  I'll like tie it to myself or wear it or something or like,
[10879.00 --> 10880.26]  it can even be pretty simple.
[10880.34 --> 10881.66]  Like I'll put the bag down.
[10882.44 --> 10882.84]  Uh,
[10882.94 --> 10883.24]  I'll,
[10883.24 --> 10887.98]  I'll kind of like hook my foot through the shoulder strap while I'm sitting down.
[10888.02 --> 10889.94]  Like it's not even a noticeable movement really.
[10890.02 --> 10892.00]  And just make it so that if you were going to pick up the bag,
[10892.02 --> 10894.36]  you'd be picking up my whole leg and then just like,
[10894.44 --> 10894.68]  whatever.
[10894.92 --> 10895.84]  And I'll just keep it that way.
[10896.60 --> 10896.96]  Um,
[10896.96 --> 10901.98]  might've had a beater laptop taken from the back of my civic once when it was broken into.
[10902.40 --> 10904.10]  But I remember at the time,
[10904.14 --> 10906.42]  not even being sure if it was in there,
[10906.46 --> 10907.68]  like it really didn't matter.
[10908.90 --> 10909.34]  Uh,
[10910.34 --> 10912.42]  so maybe my,
[10912.60 --> 10915.32]  the first laptop I ever bought still works.
[10916.60 --> 10917.16]  This one,
[10917.28 --> 10918.08]  that Asus thing.
[10919.02 --> 10919.80]  Pre that.
[10920.24 --> 10920.50]  Oh,
[10920.56 --> 10920.80]  really?
[10921.06 --> 10921.26]  Yeah.
[10921.32 --> 10922.94]  That Asus thing also still works.
[10923.04 --> 10923.20]  Yeah.
[10923.22 --> 10924.30]  I've never actually had a laptop.
[10924.30 --> 10924.72]  I gave it to someone,
[10924.86 --> 10925.90]  the like brown one,
[10925.94 --> 10926.10]  right?
[10926.18 --> 10926.34]  Yeah.
[10926.34 --> 10926.54]  Yeah.
[10926.54 --> 10926.76]  Okay.
[10926.76 --> 10926.94]  Yeah.
[10927.00 --> 10927.32]  Bamboo.
[10928.32 --> 10928.76]  Um,
[10930.06 --> 10930.30]  yeah.
[10930.64 --> 10930.84]  Yeah.
[10931.60 --> 10932.00]  Sweet.
[10932.16 --> 10932.72]  Steal a bag,
[10932.78 --> 10933.40]  get a free Luke.
[10934.60 --> 10935.04]  Yeah.
[10935.20 --> 10935.60]  Basically.
[10937.18 --> 10938.56]  It's one way to look at it.
[10940.14 --> 10940.56]  Hey DLL,
[10940.76 --> 10946.86]  I recently installed a smart panel and apparently my network closet and office are pulling 1200 watts total constantly.
[10947.38 --> 10951.52]  Any tips for how I can bring down my $600 monthly electric bill?
[10951.72 --> 10952.86]  For the network closet,
[10952.86 --> 10956.74]  there's not much you're going to be able to do other than buy new,
[10956.74 --> 10957.28]  new stuff.
[10957.42 --> 10958.00]  And it,
[10958.08 --> 10958.44]  I mean,
[10958.52 --> 10959.50]  I mean,
[10959.50 --> 10960.94]  $600 a month.
[10962.78 --> 10963.38]  Oh man,
[10963.38 --> 10965.46]  power must be way more expensive where you are.
[10965.52 --> 10967.08]  They're saying home office and stuff too,
[10967.16 --> 10967.38]  right?
[10967.72 --> 10968.04]  They're just,
[10968.16 --> 10969.20]  they added monitoring.
[10969.42 --> 10970.20]  They didn't say home office.
[10970.20 --> 10972.70]  They said my network closet and office.
[10973.70 --> 10974.06]  Office,
[10974.20 --> 10974.62]  home office.
[10974.96 --> 10975.16]  Well,
[10975.22 --> 10976.62]  you guys are assuming that it's home.
[10977.72 --> 10978.08]  Yeah.
[10978.08 --> 10979.62]  Otherwise you wouldn't care about the electricity bill.
[10980.40 --> 10981.04]  You might,
[10981.26 --> 10982.84]  if you pay utilities and you're,
[10982.94 --> 10984.24]  I don't know.
[10984.40 --> 10986.62]  I think we forget that our electricity is cheap here.
[10986.64 --> 10986.80]  Yeah,
[10986.80 --> 10986.94]  no,
[10987.00 --> 10987.44]  I think this,
[10987.56 --> 10989.52]  I think the electricity there is just really expensive.
[10989.52 --> 10994.58]  Without reducing what your electronics are doing or what,
[10994.62 --> 10996.62]  what your things drawing power are doing.
[10996.72 --> 10999.46]  The only way you can really do stuff is like get more efficient,
[10999.46 --> 11001.02]  like power supplies or something like that.
[11001.02 --> 11002.70]  1200 Watts constantly.
[11002.70 --> 11003.72]  That's a lot.
[11004.00 --> 11004.48]  Is a lot.
[11004.56 --> 11004.68]  Yeah.
[11004.80 --> 11004.96]  Two,
[11005.04 --> 11006.98]  two 40 would improve efficiency a little bit,
[11007.02 --> 11008.02]  but we're talking like,
[11008.66 --> 11008.96]  you know,
[11009.20 --> 11011.76]  three to 5% maybe.
[11011.76 --> 11012.48]  Single digit percentages.
[11012.64 --> 11012.78]  Yeah.
[11012.92 --> 11013.18]  Yeah.
[11013.18 --> 11014.68]  So maybe you're saving like,
[11014.74 --> 11015.04]  you know,
[11015.16 --> 11017.92]  20 bucks a month and whatever that upgrade is costing you,
[11017.94 --> 11018.80]  it's going to take a minute.
[11019.02 --> 11020.34]  I'm really wondering like the,
[11020.44 --> 11020.62]  what is,
[11020.74 --> 11021.62]  what is the constantly,
[11021.78 --> 11023.92]  what is running constantly that's taking that much power?
[11023.92 --> 11024.96]  Because there might be,
[11024.96 --> 11025.72]  um,
[11025.72 --> 11026.98]  some things that you can do,
[11026.98 --> 11027.82]  uh,
[11027.82 --> 11030.04]  where you can run like scheduled systems to,
[11030.04 --> 11031.82]  to shut things down or something.
[11031.88 --> 11032.30]  Cause that's,
[11032.30 --> 11033.86]  that's a lot to pull constantly.
[11034.68 --> 11035.08]  Dude,
[11035.18 --> 11036.58]  like are you running AC overnight?
[11036.94 --> 11037.44]  Oh yeah.
[11037.44 --> 11039.36]  Like AC could be a big part of it.
[11039.72 --> 11041.30]  Tim says I'm in Massachusetts.
[11041.30 --> 11042.46]  I have a home lab.
[11042.52 --> 11044.82]  I spend a thousand dollars a month in electricity.
[11046.76 --> 11047.20]  Yeah.
[11047.20 --> 11049.78]  We're really lucky that our power comes from falling water here.
[11050.00 --> 11050.44]  Um,
[11051.16 --> 11052.12]  yeah,
[11052.12 --> 11052.46]  you gotta,
[11053.46 --> 11059.10]  other than buying new stuff that is more modern or doing less with it,
[11059.16 --> 11060.54]  shutting it down when you're not using it,
[11060.58 --> 11061.46]  putting it on a schedule,
[11061.46 --> 11062.02]  there's,
[11062.14 --> 11063.06]  I don't know what to tell you.
[11063.06 --> 11065.54]  Cause utility power costs what utility power costs.
[11065.60 --> 11065.70]  I mean,
[11065.70 --> 11066.80]  you could put up solar panels.
[11066.98 --> 11067.38]  Um,
[11067.42 --> 11068.16]  that's an option.
[11070.04 --> 11070.82]  I mean,
[11070.86 --> 11072.46]  you're spending a lot in order to,
[11072.50 --> 11073.66]  to make these upgrades,
[11073.66 --> 11074.22]  but like,
[11074.34 --> 11076.84]  it's also costing you a lot to not make them.
[11076.84 --> 11078.62]  So it almost seems like you'd have to,
[11078.62 --> 11080.98]  I feel like it's gotta be,
[11081.08 --> 11082.60]  because he said constantly,
[11082.60 --> 11084.26]  my interpretation of that is like,
[11084.30 --> 11086.34]  even at four in the morning when no one's there.
[11086.34 --> 11089.22]  So my assumption is that certain things just need to be shut down,
[11089.30 --> 11091.80]  whether that's AC or something else.
[11092.06 --> 11092.60]  Maybe the computer.
[11092.98 --> 11093.00]  I mean,
[11093.00 --> 11093.34]  I agree.
[11093.34 --> 11093.96]  1200 watts,
[11094.02 --> 11095.96]  like that doesn't even account for having AC running.
[11096.06 --> 11096.18]  Yeah,
[11096.18 --> 11096.60]  it's not enough,
[11096.66 --> 11096.90]  is it?
[11097.00 --> 11097.26]  Yeah.
[11097.68 --> 11098.10]  It's gotta be,
[11098.16 --> 11099.56]  he's leaving the computer on constantly.
[11100.38 --> 11101.00]  Shut her down.
[11101.26 --> 11101.42]  Yeah.
[11101.42 --> 11101.84]  Put her to sleep.
[11102.18 --> 11102.74]  Hibernate it.
[11103.00 --> 11103.22]  Yeah.
[11104.80 --> 11105.50]  Do something.
[11105.98 --> 11107.26]  I feel like something can change.
[11109.56 --> 11109.78]  Hmm.
[11112.22 --> 11112.86]  Up next,
[11113.26 --> 11113.64]  Linus,
[11113.64 --> 11114.68]  the closet gamer.
[11115.00 --> 11118.98]  You have said in the past that you didn't agree with some of the decisions that LMG made.
[11119.46 --> 11120.48]  What were they?
[11120.60 --> 11121.98]  Who made those decisions then?
[11122.56 --> 11122.70]  Oh,
[11122.78 --> 11123.28]  oh man,
[11123.32 --> 11126.32]  there's all kinds of decisions that I don't necessarily agree with.
[11126.42 --> 11127.18]  It's a big company now.
[11127.26 --> 11128.70]  I could probably just search my email.
[11128.82 --> 11129.00]  I mean,
[11129.00 --> 11130.26]  even in the earlier days.
[11130.84 --> 11131.42]  Oh yeah.
[11132.52 --> 11134.74]  I'm just going to search my email for the phrase.
[11134.82 --> 11135.52]  I don't agree.
[11137.40 --> 11137.98]  It's sort of,
[11138.06 --> 11138.82]  oh my God,
[11138.86 --> 11139.48]  there's so many.
[11140.26 --> 11140.54]  Uh,
[11140.54 --> 11140.84]  hold on.
[11140.92 --> 11141.06]  Well,
[11141.12 --> 11141.26]  yeah,
[11141.26 --> 11141.48]  I'd,
[11141.48 --> 11142.78]  I'd kind of hope so at this point,
[11142.78 --> 11143.22]  to be honest,
[11143.22 --> 11144.26]  we've been around for so long.
[11144.26 --> 11146.88]  If he didn't disagree that many times,
[11146.88 --> 11147.18]  like,
[11147.96 --> 11148.46]  uh,
[11148.74 --> 11150.28]  he's like too agreeable at that point.
[11150.82 --> 11151.04]  Okay.
[11151.08 --> 11152.06]  I searched for,
[11152.22 --> 11153.96]  which we know is not a problem.
[11155.12 --> 11155.56]  Hmm.
[11155.56 --> 11155.70]  Hmm.
[11158.56 --> 11159.04]  Hmm.
[11159.04 --> 11159.36]  Hmm.
[11161.52 --> 11162.04]  Hmm.
[11164.30 --> 11164.74]  Hmm.
[11165.18 --> 11165.86]  Uh,
[11165.86 --> 11166.22]  G dub.
[11166.30 --> 11167.60]  Sometimes I don't agree with myself.
[11167.76 --> 11167.92]  I,
[11168.02 --> 11168.62]  I like that.
[11168.84 --> 11169.18]  That's good.
[11169.18 --> 11177.08]  my position can change on things no exactly that's reasonable
[11177.08 --> 11181.34]  oh yeah i okay i'm trying to
[11181.34 --> 11190.74]  don't foresee the results no i mean hmm i uh man what could i
[11190.74 --> 11197.64]  oh i'm gonna search for try anything twice because that's a line i often use when people
[11197.64 --> 11201.30]  suggest something to me and uh
[11201.30 --> 11210.80]  okay uh this is regarding the compilation of scrapyard wars my response is just try anything
[11210.80 --> 11218.94]  twice i support it i do and i said i no okay i didn't this i didn't really have an opinion on
[11218.94 --> 11223.66]  man i guess a lot of this would take place like via chat luke can you think of something we did
[11223.66 --> 11229.90]  that i was like i don't agree but let's try it anyway like i feel like there's definitely been
[11229.90 --> 11235.20]  i promise you this has happened a bunch of times i can't really think of like a particular example
[11235.20 --> 11242.72]  like there's there's definitely concepts for videos that i've been like i don't agree
[11242.72 --> 11249.80]  yeah um but we can try it and see how it goes or like like titling a video where i'm like okay
[11249.80 --> 11255.04]  yeah yeah go ahead and try it um i don't think that's the best approach
[11255.04 --> 11261.54]  i can't know there's i can't think of a particular one off the top of my head but i know there was
[11261.54 --> 11266.40]  videos back in the day that we'd go back and forth on and you'd let me try stuff and sometimes it would
[11266.40 --> 11270.30]  work and you were wrong and sometimes it wouldn't work at all and you were right and it's just like
[11270.30 --> 11272.30]  i don't know how it would go
[11272.30 --> 11282.28]  okay um all right well i don't know do you want to do you want to do another one and i'll i'll keep
[11282.28 --> 11287.62]  trying to find something in the meantime sure do you have any for me dad yeah i know that there's
[11287.62 --> 11296.58]  one or two in here let's see if i can find it ah hey lld luke what's your favorite lean back game
[11296.58 --> 11301.80]  to relax with these days oh i thought of something oh okay never mind luke shut up
[11301.80 --> 11313.74]  uh we're doing it uh we're doing a fairly costly uh customer survey oh yeah yeah um i don't agree
[11313.74 --> 11323.72]  i i told i told uh the senior management team that i don't think it's the best possible use of money
[11323.72 --> 11329.04]  i think that a lot of the things we're looking to learn from it are things that if the product team
[11329.04 --> 11335.32]  at creator warehouse wants to know i could probably i could probably get them 70 to 80 percent of the
[11335.32 --> 11342.52]  way there by just chatting with them for 30 to 60 minutes um a lot of the questions we're asking i
[11342.52 --> 11352.18]  i understand why they want to to do it in this way by by hiring like a like a survey company to
[11352.18 --> 11358.68]  that specializes in you know the the composition of the questions and the sampling and and whatever
[11358.68 --> 11363.18]  else and it has you know these connections um i
[11363.18 --> 11366.62]  i uh
[11366.62 --> 11379.62]  i think that the polling and survey industry is inherently flawed um because truly neutral sampling
[11379.62 --> 11385.84]  is literally impossible especially in the in the modern age and you you see that with highly
[11385.84 --> 11393.86]  publicized survey results like u.s election predictions um u.s election polls uh so we're doing it
[11393.86 --> 11398.84]  we're spending what i consider to be a not very um
[11398.84 --> 11409.98]  uh amount of money that i'd like to spend on it uh but i greenlit it because this was something that
[11409.98 --> 11419.96]  the team other than me and yvonne and some other people is aligned on and my whole thing is like okay
[11419.96 --> 11426.74]  well then here's my expectations in terms of measuring a return on this um
[11426.74 --> 11436.34]  and i hope you know what you're doing um tieback says this is a mistake you're airing dirty laundry
[11436.34 --> 11442.52]  it's not dirty laundry it's okay to disagree i've said that a bunch of times on the show show as linus
[11442.52 --> 11447.54]  i i've said a billion times on the show that this this company makes decisions that i don't agree with
[11447.54 --> 11452.54]  all the time yeah and that's okay and that's okay you're never going to be in an organization
[11452.54 --> 11457.36]  where you agree with literally every single action the company ever takes and i've provided
[11457.36 --> 11463.42]  my rationale but let's make sure i provide their rationale as well their rationale is that
[11463.42 --> 11470.18]  if we sample our existing customers it doesn't tell us much about the the broader customer base
[11470.18 --> 11475.02]  that's out there if we just you know go based on gut feeling well then or like you know
[11475.02 --> 11482.24]  what we've anecdotally observed over the years sure yeah that might get us 70 or 80 of the way there
[11482.24 --> 11487.68]  but if this gets us a few more percent um that might at the very least uh you know help guide
[11487.68 --> 11495.26]  product development in a more uh in a more um scientific you know a more a more rigorous way
[11495.26 --> 11502.84]  um part of the justification is that that's just what these things cost so if we want to dip our toes
[11502.84 --> 11509.06]  into into data collection in this manner this is just kind of what it costs to have a credible company
[11509.06 --> 11513.58]  do it and then we can decide after trying it once if that's something that we want to do again
[11513.58 --> 11522.04]  so there are absolutely absolutely counter arguments and at the end of the day i said i don't agree
[11522.04 --> 11535.14]  bold bold bold well you gotta you gotta try stuff right i mean if i just wanted to
[11535.14 --> 11542.94]  if if all we ever did was my perspective then that could potentially limit our capacity for
[11542.94 --> 11550.06]  new ideas and growth right um there is this whole problem um with founders
[11550.06 --> 11555.02]  where uh in some cases to like grow past a certain point
[11555.02 --> 11560.46]  you you either need to like cycle them out or certain job functions can't be done by them anymore
[11560.46 --> 11563.94]  because they'll have a certain scope of thinking that doesn't necessarily continue to work
[11563.94 --> 11568.78]  and to be clear there's certain times when i would absolutely stick to my guns
[11568.78 --> 11577.94]  um yeah but when it's a difference of opinion you have to leave openings yeah
[11577.94 --> 11584.84]  okay sorry what was the question for luke i want to hear now what's your favorite lean
[11584.84 --> 11587.42]  back game to relax with these days oh
[11587.42 --> 11595.34]  i don't do that as much these days
[11595.34 --> 11606.66]  um not playing you assume luke leans back yeah time has been expensive for me lately um
[11606.66 --> 11616.68]  hmm genuinely lean back is a tough one uh because usually i i'm more like i'll i'll go play pokemon go
[11616.68 --> 11621.14]  because it gets me outside i'm walking i try to stay in constant movement when i'm playing pokemon go
[11621.14 --> 11627.92]  as much as possible um literally the opposite yeah it's not a lean back but it is relaxing yeah
[11627.92 --> 11633.58]  i'm changing the words which is not fair so and i think that makes sense yeah so it's i i wanted to
[11633.58 --> 11640.54]  include the answer because it's sort of in line but it's it's also completely not uh so a general
[11640.54 --> 11649.84]  lean back game i haven't played it in forever but um either uh civ so civilization or ftl is not a
[11649.84 --> 11654.54]  lean back game i i sweat when i play the game i always make it like hardest possible lcs stresses
[11654.54 --> 11660.68]  hell go crazy um i've beat all the challenges in the game on all the anyways that's impressive
[11660.68 --> 11665.54]  actually um i i am a ftl sweat it's one of my favorite games ever very sweet um
[11665.54 --> 11676.44]  uh but yeah so civ or uh assassin's creed um right now it's you can tell i played all the time
[11676.44 --> 11683.96]  because i don't remember the name odyssey odyssey odyssey let me look it up did you ever mess with
[11683.96 --> 11693.92]  dwarf fortress uh sort of give me a sec though yes assassin's creed odyssey i've been playing this game
[11693.92 --> 11701.36]  for uh it looks like six years i play it you know every once like every three to six months i'll go
[11701.36 --> 11709.26]  jump in and do a few missions and then leave again the the setting is beautiful the assassin's
[11709.26 --> 11716.00]  creed odyssey is a beautiful game great sound you have a really cool uh partner buddy and like this pet
[11716.00 --> 11722.66]  eagle that you have um the environment and setting is just is absolutely fantastic so it's a very fun
[11722.66 --> 11730.26]  game to go just chill in um yeah i don't know that's it though
[11730.26 --> 11741.94]  okay let's see what else do we have hey leak lime and dewdrop nice linus uh when are we getting more
[11741.94 --> 11751.36]  house build updates oh very soon i actually reviewed a video today that is fixing the um
[11751.36 --> 11758.80]  um we think we hope uh fixing the corrosion issue with the water loops and adding leak sensing
[11758.80 --> 11765.92]  leak sensing is good yeah you have flow issues with that you have a crazy pump so maybe it doesn't
[11765.92 --> 11772.92]  matter um we were having some flow issues but that was due to the like particle filter that we had in
[11772.92 --> 11778.08]  line we got a better particle filter and it seems to be flowing a lot better now so cool uh yes but no
[11778.08 --> 11786.16]  linus are you still grateful of having this job years ago you kept mentioning that you have the
[11786.16 --> 11791.12]  world's best job but you don't really bring this up lately being frustrated by the community instead
[11791.12 --> 11799.20]  hmm it's a good question heavy um good question though well framed too i am grateful
[11799.20 --> 11812.56]  i have definitely found a more i have definitely found a less positive side of it um particularly
[11812.56 --> 11820.96]  over the last year or so and i don't think it's new uh i just think that for a long time the
[11820.96 --> 11830.48]  supportive voices largely overwhelmed to the point of completely drowning out the less uh supportive
[11830.48 --> 11836.80]  voices animosity and negativity in the tech space has like massively spiked i um it sucks a lot out of
[11836.80 --> 11843.60]  curiosity because other than sony's own video we have the highest viewed video on the playstation 5 pro
[11843.60 --> 11851.04]  like it's not even close um so out of curiosity i went over to r slash ps5 like reddit hates me it's
[11851.04 --> 11858.88]  it's like not that's not subjective that's just a fact uh largely speaking the reddit community just
[11858.88 --> 11868.32]  whether it's dismissive or um or outright hostile uh in in general the redditor community just kind of
[11868.32 --> 11876.96]  hates me um and so i i went over i was just i was curious do we even merit a post let alone you know
[11876.96 --> 11884.88]  getting any up votes over there and not only did our ps5 pro video which multiple people elsewhere
[11884.88 --> 11892.48]  like off of reddit um pointed out how balanced it was like we did point out the things that um that sony
[11892.48 --> 11897.68]  did that were making it very difficult for people the extremely high price for a console is uh
[11898.24 --> 11903.44]  is a tough pill to swallow in this economy you know like it's it's not it's not it's not great but we
[11903.44 --> 11911.12]  also talked through and explained why why it costs what it costs uh so not only did we not merit a post
[11911.12 --> 11919.20]  even though people are clearly watching it people are watching it um but our last couple of playstation
[11919.20 --> 11927.60]  products uh so the i believe it was the portal and the psvr had a bunch of discussion about
[11927.60 --> 11934.96]  them when the videos were posted zero up votes um not because there was any particular
[11936.32 --> 11941.68]  argument against anything we said but just because outside of
[11941.68 --> 11955.92]  outside of and even within the ltt community there is uh an amount of animosity that i am having a hard
[11955.92 --> 11961.60]  time really coming to grips with uh it's been interesting which i think is fair it's been
[11961.60 --> 11967.12]  interesting watching the discourse change around something like the framework investment when we did
[11967.12 --> 11974.32]  it it was with full transparency and with the informed consent of the community um you know
[11974.32 --> 11981.12]  understanding what this was what it meant what would and wouldn't change sorry are you talking the
[11981.12 --> 11989.28]  their framework investment right now so not only the full consent the excited involvement and over time
[11990.24 --> 11997.68]  that has morphed from enthusiastic support and i don't mean for everyone a lot of people are still
[11997.68 --> 12004.48]  like very much like raw raw framework in fact too much i mean austin posted that not completely positive
[12004.48 --> 12011.36]  video and people piled on him it's just another edge of the sword of too much animosity there's too much
[12011.36 --> 12016.88]  fighting so a lot of people are still very supportive but there's there's another sort of portion of the
[12016.88 --> 12024.00]  tech community that just looks at it and goes okay well you know linus is compromised now because he's got this
[12024.00 --> 12033.84]  framework investment but what i don't see is i don't see anybody actually providing any concrete evidence to
[12033.84 --> 12043.68]  suggest that the framework investment has affected my coverage of any mobile device show me show me
[12043.68 --> 12054.96]  where i said something that was on unfairly flattering of framework or unfairly critical of a competitor to
[12054.96 --> 12062.56]  framework show me if anything i treat them like the coach's son yeah i reviewed a script i've got that
[12062.56 --> 12069.36]  vibe a couple times i reviewed a script with elijah today um we had someone come to us um with a
[12069.36 --> 12074.88]  complaint about their customer service experience with framework so it took us a little while but we
[12074.88 --> 12083.44]  secret shopped them um and i was not involved um elijah alex um some unnamed people who are staying
[12083.44 --> 12089.04]  anonymous because they're not staff and if we can use their credit cards for mystery shopping then hey why
[12089.04 --> 12094.48]  don't we just not disclose their names and then we could use them again um so so a team of people
[12094.48 --> 12099.20]  put together a secret a secret shop for framework and as i was going through i went out of my way
[12100.08 --> 12106.56]  to if anything i still i still did act in my role as editor but when i made a change to the script
[12107.20 --> 12115.12]  i made 100 certain that everything i did toned down the positivity as opposed to toned it up or i
[12115.12 --> 12121.92]  explicitly checked with elijah and i said does this still convey your thoughts about it um
[12127.44 --> 12133.28]  i don't know it's uh it's been a it's been a really difficult thing i uh uh if we're deep enough
[12133.28 --> 12140.16]  in wanshow at this point that maybe i'll maybe i'll just say this but i i i made it sometimes i make
[12140.16 --> 12144.96]  edits to the script as we're as we're going through and we're working together on tweaks to it
[12144.96 --> 12148.96]  that are just meant to be a joke they're just meant to get a laugh out of the writer who's sitting
[12148.96 --> 12156.88]  next to me like watching me change stuff and um i i put i put in i put in a bit about how realistically
[12157.52 --> 12164.72]  the value of frameworks investment for me is less than um i could pro i could probably name
[12165.60 --> 12170.96]  half a dozen laptop brands that have paid me more over the course of my career than the value of my
[12170.96 --> 12177.20]  investment framework like if you um and it was kind of a funny point it was kind of po it was kind of
[12177.20 --> 12191.36]  poking fun at this idea that uh that somehow it was going to affect my day-to-day operation of the company
[12191.36 --> 12201.36]  other than to be extra extra extra careful about it i mean you know this every single time the idea
[12201.36 --> 12208.48]  of framework has been brought up when it comes to internal use what do i say every single time if
[12208.48 --> 12215.60]  anything you point out that they're expensive and you push against it if anything and outside of that
[12215.60 --> 12219.60]  you usually like i don't want to be involved with the conversation because we were we were looking into
[12219.60 --> 12225.44]  getting frameworks for internal laptops because of you know their repairability and other stuff going
[12225.44 --> 12232.80]  on but honestly they're really expensive they're really expensive they don't touch screens it's tough
[12232.80 --> 12238.48]  yeah there's a lot of people the company that are pretty ride or die for touch screens um and again
[12239.12 --> 12245.92]  they're really expensive so i don't know hopefully they can figure that out that cyborg relay says i've
[12245.92 --> 12250.88]  seen someone say you accidentally auctioned an engineering sample uh or whatever controversy it
[12250.88 --> 12256.56]  was to attack that brand because they were a framework competitor truly unhinged and and the thing is that
[12256.56 --> 12267.52]  like it was it was very it was enlightening but also disheartening um rossman's video supporting our
[12267.52 --> 12279.20]  degoogle your life series uh because the the the the portion of the tech community that um
[12282.24 --> 12289.12]  i don't i don't under i don't understand it uh if you if you wait if you wait into that mess um
[12289.12 --> 12301.60]  um it's uh i don't know maybe if you have like a like a background in psychoanalysis you can let me know
[12301.60 --> 12308.88]  what you think the kind of rationale behind it is but it's uh it's pretty intense it's tough and um i still
[12308.88 --> 12316.64]  have a great job and i still um am extremely grateful especially for the years where things were largely
[12316.64 --> 12323.52]  not largely they're still largely supportive and positive it's actually been it's been really
[12323.52 --> 12330.24]  encouraging seeing viewership tick back up we're like i think we i think we cracked like 80 million
[12330.24 --> 12337.28]  views on ltt we've been actually executing really well on content uh overall audience audience sentiment
[12337.28 --> 12346.40]  has been really good but the um i do miss the days when it was almost universally
[12347.04 --> 12352.96]  supportive and that doesn't mean that i just expect adulation for everything i do i i have always
[12353.84 --> 12360.00]  solicited um constructive criticism we had a rule on the forum when we first started it that you
[12360.00 --> 12366.16]  you couldn't attack you know other creators in the space each other um other people moderators media
[12366.16 --> 12371.28]  group moderators basically anyone but you could go after linus and myself and it was genuinely fine for
[12371.28 --> 12377.84]  a long time because people would do it but it was not a huge population of people and usually the
[12378.48 --> 12385.84]  people would just kind of deal with it and move on and it was fine it was it was genuinely fine for like
[12385.84 --> 12392.80]  many years and now it's just i think there's a little bit of shooting the messenger like people people
[12392.80 --> 12401.60]  there's some people that are still extremely angry about like ad block his piracy thing yeah like
[12401.60 --> 12408.16]  really angry um which i genuinely at no point in time have ever understood because everyone's like
[12408.80 --> 12413.60]  happily posting memes about pulling the pirate hat back out again and stuff but then pointing out that
[12413.60 --> 12418.96]  that that is also that who cares if you don't care insults them it's like what do you mean if you
[12418.96 --> 12425.92]  don't care and you sleep well pirating movies and music like software a different line i don't know
[12425.92 --> 12431.76]  why is this a worse line i don't i don't i don't know i've i've genuinely never understood it i don't know
[12432.88 --> 12439.20]  i don't know dude whatever um or like you know when when you have that conversation that basically
[12439.20 --> 12443.20]  goes but just like understand that when you pull the funding away from something it gets worse
[12444.00 --> 12452.16]  yeah like dude the state of news media now it's terrifying yeah it's terrifying and the deeper you
[12452.16 --> 12461.12]  go down that rabbit hole the scarier it is yeah we are so we are so vulnerable right now because we
[12461.12 --> 12467.76]  weren't willing to pay a subscription and we're still not willing to pay a subscription to support like
[12467.76 --> 12477.76]  real journalism um yeah so there's been a couple comments one of them was saying that like it's not
[12477.76 --> 12484.72]  just you guys um while that is true i genuinely believe that we get a higher percentage than most
[12484.72 --> 12490.64]  because of a lot of stuff that happened it's tall poppy and and that and that both really but there's
[12490.64 --> 12496.72]  channels that are just as big as us that don't get anywhere near as much um and then also uh there's
[12496.72 --> 12507.28]  been some comments of people telling me to like pull this topic along because it's clearly negative
[12507.28 --> 12512.88]  and that we should just ignore the trolls i hear you i don't want us to do this all the time on way
[12512.88 --> 12519.52]  and show but i think sometimes showing kind of what's going on on our end is just sort of being honest with
[12519.52 --> 12529.60]  the viewers um and it's pretty intense like uh if you sort that that rossman video that you mentioned
[12530.40 --> 12534.64]  pretty positive video overall if you go into the comments it's not entirely positive but it's a
[12534.64 --> 12537.68]  pretty positive video if you go into the comments and you sort by newest
[12540.48 --> 12545.36]  brutal yeah and it's like it's easy to say well forget the haters but
[12545.36 --> 12552.56]  it's not that small of a niche you know that's a video that has well over half a million views
[12552.56 --> 12560.48]  now thousands and thousands of comments um and there's this almost universal just like
[12561.60 --> 12569.76]  i don't know how to describe it other than just like yeah animosity hostility um anger and expression
[12569.76 --> 12577.20]  of anger paired with a note that no action no matter what you do can ever be redeeming
[12577.20 --> 12584.00]  i noticed that at a very oddly consistent rate there was a bunch of different people clearly not bots
[12584.88 --> 12588.56]  but just like this doesn't make it okay and nothing that is ever done
[12588.56 --> 12596.16]  can fix my opinion of this person it's like whoa yeah and it's it's it's uh what's the term malding
[12596.88 --> 12604.16]  yeah like it's it it's it's it's tough to relate to like i i try to take feedback right like i try to uh
[12604.88 --> 12611.12]  we we've always taken in in data and tried to throw out what's bad and keep what's good and keep evolving
[12611.12 --> 12617.92]  keep evolving right um but when you when you get something that's just like um i'm mad and nothing can
[12617.92 --> 12624.88]  ever change that i'm mad i don't even necessarily know what i'm mad about but um you know here's
[12624.88 --> 12630.48]  what i've kind of like here's what i've kind of grabbed onto as the justification for my behavior
[12630.48 --> 12634.96]  it's i don't i don't really know how to deal with that um speaking of things that i that i that we've
[12634.96 --> 12640.00]  done that i haven't agreed with um i strongly disagreed with a lot of the ways that we handled
[12640.00 --> 12642.08]  the controversy last year um
[12642.08 --> 12652.16]  um but that's part of making decisions together as a team that's part of making uh decisions based
[12652.16 --> 12657.04]  on you know the best information that you feel that you have at the time uh i felt like there was
[12657.04 --> 12665.12]  a lot we could have said and i wanted to say but you have to you have to manage there's also that it was
[12665.12 --> 12673.12]  in two parts well makes it complicated yeah i don't want to get away to anything yeah we're definitely
[12673.12 --> 12679.36]  not going to do that because if we were to make a decision about changing what we have or haven't
[12679.36 --> 12684.32]  said about any of that that would be a decision we'd make as a team because what you have to understand
[12685.60 --> 12693.52]  past a certain point is that the decisions you make impact more than just you there's a hundred
[12693.52 --> 12698.48]  people on payroll who depend on this company and that was shown that was thrown into sharp relief last year
[12699.28 --> 12708.24]  when i think i think a lot of the crusaders felt like they were taking down you know like a a big bad ogre
[12708.96 --> 12717.36]  um when at the end of the day i already made my money and the people whose lives that if we went down
[12717.36 --> 12723.28]  which we we weren't going to we didn't we kind of are awesome and we have a great team literally world class
[12723.52 --> 12731.36]  um but if we went down the people whose lives would have been most negatively impacted would have
[12731.36 --> 12737.92]  been small creators i often hear people say yeah i don't watch ltt i watch small creators because i
[12737.92 --> 12746.80]  want to support small creators you know oh you mean smaller creators like dan besser you know producer of
[12746.80 --> 12754.40]  uh of this weekly podcast who by the way creates every day for a living here lots of things um
[12759.44 --> 12764.32]  even in that same sense if you start looking to uh external to this company small creators
[12764.88 --> 12772.32]  um i have always believed in a rising tide lifts all ships when we were at our peak
[12772.32 --> 12777.60]  week so was the entire tech youtuber sphere
[12779.84 --> 12787.44]  when we slumped so did everyone now i don't think that we can assign any causality of us yeah there's
[12787.44 --> 12793.52]  been there's been other challenges the whole industry follows a similar line yep um and i don't think that
[12793.52 --> 12799.20]  i mean that relax i don't think that members of the tech media tearing each other down is constructive i
[12799.20 --> 12806.32]  think that i think that i think that we have always worked to build up
[12809.60 --> 12810.16]  technically no
[12813.68 --> 12819.36]  i don't there's there's the one case where we were negatively comparing i'm saying we as a company not
[12819.36 --> 12826.40]  us not you and me as individuals oh we were negatively comparing other outlets sure but i think we
[12826.40 --> 12832.72]  dealt with that pretty decisively i agree i'm just saying okay yeah i can't i can't control what every
[12832.72 --> 12840.16]  single person says and does no um yeah there was a there was an error in a in a video a little while
[12840.16 --> 12849.76]  ago that um you know basically i was accused of being biased in some way i don't want to get into the
[12849.76 --> 12853.68]  exact details because it's just not worth it but i was accused of being biased and i was sitting there
[12853.68 --> 12860.72]  going like i didn't even touch that i never saw it yeah that's tough and it's like i think i think
[12860.72 --> 12867.68]  that's largely because like that might not work that way this uh here we have 100 plus people but a
[12867.68 --> 12873.44]  lot of youtubers are one two-bit operations so people do think that they basically see everything but it's
[12873.44 --> 12879.28]  like we're not yeah we're super not um
[12883.84 --> 12886.72]  so yeah i am still grateful um
[12889.36 --> 12896.08]  it's harder to keep track of that um there are there are definitely times i i was i was swimming in my
[12896.08 --> 12904.24]  private pool the other day and i thought no really though and i was like this is this is the pool that
[12904.24 --> 12909.68]  you know this none of this would be possible this is a crazy life i could have never imagined for myself
[12909.68 --> 12918.00]  if i hadn't through a combination of uh hard work talent and being exceptionally lucky i was in the right
[12918.00 --> 12922.72]  place at the right time um this is something that never would have been possible this is absolutely
[12922.72 --> 12926.64]  incredible and just like had this moment of gratitude i was i have to confess i was thinking
[12926.64 --> 12931.60]  not as much about you guys i was actually thinking more of um my wife and the team um
[12933.04 --> 12940.40]  sorry you guys are totally totally integral to the whole thing like for real um yeah that was like
[12941.28 --> 12947.44]  three days ago so yeah i definitely think about it often but um it's harder in the day-to-day these
[12947.44 --> 12952.56]  days it's it's been it's been very challenging it has to just to you know help us come up for air
[12952.56 --> 12959.12]  a little bit here though yeah you mentioned earlier teams are doing better things are getting better
[12959.12 --> 12965.92]  yeah all of that is true yeah like uh not only are performance metrics coming back but i genuinely think
[12966.96 --> 12972.00]  the space is getting a little bit less toxic i think there's been a sentiment shift towards us
[12972.00 --> 12979.04]  specifically as well um yeah i i'm honestly looking more overall at the whole industry but that's
[12979.04 --> 12983.92]  probably also true in regards to us i think they're kind of related maybe i think they're
[12983.92 --> 12989.36]  kind of related i think a lot people are maybe tired of it i think because it's exhausting it is
[12989.92 --> 12997.28]  it's very exhausting i'm i'm just tired of being angry yeah i don't have the energy for it anymore
[12998.08 --> 13005.36]  like why why are we doing this the answer has to be because we love it otherwise
[13005.36 --> 13013.12]  why oh oh oh you mean like the work i thought you meant the fighting yeah no sorry i was like
[13014.64 --> 13017.44]  um yeah i don't know that's um
[13020.64 --> 13026.08]  yeah and i i i am genuinely it was a little doom and gloom for a while there at this point i'm seeing
[13026.08 --> 13030.72]  the light at the end of the tunnel i think we can get back maybe not exactly where we were but i think we
[13030.72 --> 13038.48]  can i think we can fix some of this um and it's gonna it's gonna take effectively everybody
[13040.24 --> 13049.12]  well creators viewers can you guys be part of it like can we just can we try to you know not not be
[13049.12 --> 13054.96]  upset about if someone just likes the ps portal even though it's locked down can you just be okay with
[13054.96 --> 13062.16]  that if they just like it is that okay yeah and to be clear this this means honestly mostly elsewhere
[13062.16 --> 13068.96]  right not just us um and it doesn't mean just like accepting everything all the time just
[13071.12 --> 13078.48]  king ghost i miss the friendly collaboration too yeah i literally my favorite thing
[13078.48 --> 13085.20]  out of practically everything used to be going to events and having these dinners that we used to do
[13085.20 --> 13091.52]  luke we had dozens of creators at probably the biggest tech creator dinner that has ever taken place
[13091.52 --> 13098.72]  yeah at ltx and then sick literally weeks later we were living on ostracization island
[13099.68 --> 13105.68]  literally weeks later yeah as if it never happened and we never did anything to help build up the space
[13105.68 --> 13111.60]  as if we were evil people motivated only by whatever like tearing people down i uh
[13112.64 --> 13118.72]  i quite the quite the peak and fall because that that i still got whiplash yeah we we were like
[13119.28 --> 13126.88]  videos were killing it i think public perception was super super high and this is i mean this is a
[13126.88 --> 13132.56]  story that's been told a bunch of times in reality yeah but uh yeah we were we were at a hell of a peak at
[13132.56 --> 13143.84]  that point in time um anyway hey we had a club go live today yeah evan and caitlin super cool yeah
[13143.84 --> 13151.28]  we have some more collabs coming i'm i'm i'm very excited for everything that's coming and uh yeah
[13151.28 --> 13156.80]  we've been we've been killing it no thank you anonymous uh yes i am grateful and you know what
[13156.80 --> 13162.56]  maybe it was uh maybe it was cathartic too to have this to have this conversation i don't want to do
[13162.56 --> 13169.52]  this all the time no no me neither but um i think this time it's good to recenter and refocus every
[13169.52 --> 13176.88]  once in a while thank you yeah and like look at the channel man he is five pro video 1.4 million views
[13176.88 --> 13183.20]  apple event video 1.5 million views 50 versus 50 000 computer 1.3 million views 1.9 million views on
[13183.20 --> 13189.12]  why the youtube video are taking down lowest rated pc 1.3 million views 1.6 on on the tech upgrade
[13189.68 --> 13196.32]  content has been killing it yep i understand the printer video isn't doing that well you still got
[13196.32 --> 13201.60]  800 000 views on a printer no one even buys those show me anyone else who can get 800 000
[13201.60 --> 13206.80]  views on a printer at a certain point it's like that's still pretty cool like yeah it's not doing
[13206.80 --> 13211.92]  as well as the other ones but it's a printer i remember using a line a lot like that when i would
[13211.92 --> 13218.64]  back when i would pitch to brands i'd be like especially it brands consumer electronics uh you
[13218.64 --> 13224.64]  know they can they can go to they could go to like a like okay this is contemporary right or
[13224.64 --> 13229.92]  contemporaneous uh so they could go to a casey neistat you know like samsung or whatever right
[13230.48 --> 13236.40]  go to someone lifestyle right um but it brands i would i would often pull out this line i'd be like
[13236.40 --> 13239.60]  like tell me who else can get a million views on a hard drive
[13242.40 --> 13252.40]  i'll wait um like it's we are i think we're really good and it's not it's not just me we as a team are
[13252.40 --> 13258.96]  really good at finding what's interesting about about technology and and being excited about it and
[13258.96 --> 13265.52]  sharing that excitement that's our superpower and and watch that and also watch everyone else's stuff i
[13265.52 --> 13269.60]  don't know the tech space is cool and different angles are cool we say all the time we'll say it
[13269.60 --> 13275.44]  now if you watch review on something watch other reviews as well yeah like that's never gonna change
[13275.44 --> 13281.44]  i want this tide not only do i believe that the tide lifts all the ships i want it to lift all the ships
[13281.44 --> 13288.72]  the space is uninteresting if it's just a few players um and that's how things slowly die you you
[13288.72 --> 13294.80]  want it to be vibrant and lively you want a lot of places for people to go for information for news for
[13294.80 --> 13300.32]  entertainment content all the type of stuff where the interest is this type of tech stuff that's how
[13301.12 --> 13306.40]  everything is going to be able to move forward best and that's how you that's how you sow the seeds of
[13306.40 --> 13312.48]  the next generation of creators as well yeah like if we're just down and angry and negative all the
[13312.48 --> 13318.72]  time how are we gonna how's anyone gonna get enthusiastic and if you're replace me smashing on anyone for
[13318.72 --> 13325.52]  for having a slightly different opinion uh there's no real space for for new angles new talent new ideas
[13325.52 --> 13334.24]  new ideas yeah um so try to try to promote the idea of of different angles on things different
[13334.24 --> 13340.88]  opinions on things different approaches to things and then there's more of a chance um that that person
[13340.88 --> 13346.80]  in their in their bedroom with a camera that had bought a new phone can make a video on it and and
[13346.80 --> 13351.12]  start a career that way like jim's text says the printer video was good it was a bummer that the
[13351.12 --> 13354.88]  only laser printer you had was monochrome there are some good color laser printers out there that are
[13354.88 --> 13360.00]  cheap also that's a really good point i think it was just kind of a limitation of the format we were
[13360.00 --> 13369.20]  trying to do that thing where the increments go up in 10x and at 400 you can get a really nice tank based
[13369.20 --> 13375.60]  inkjet at four dollars you can get a piece of garbage bubble jet we literally did get a four
[13375.60 --> 13380.96]  dollar printer though um it was like seven six and a half canadian dollars or something like that i
[13380.96 --> 13387.28]  forgot exactly what it was but it was like 450 us or something and then at 40 you're not getting a
[13387.28 --> 13392.64]  color laser you're getting a black and white laser so i would have actually really liked to show like a
[13392.64 --> 13399.04]  60 70 option that's like a color laser that will at least do like color documents or whatever we tried
[13399.04 --> 13404.48]  to kind of talk about it but you're right you're right that was that was something where we we tried
[13404.48 --> 13413.12]  something we tried so we we tried this like uh increments of 10x format with the um 50 versus 500
[13413.12 --> 13418.16]  versus 5 000 versus 50 000 computer thing we tried it with the printers i don't think we have anything
[13418.16 --> 13424.32]  else in the queue right now but we gotta try stuff we gotta try stuff could maybe do honorable mentions
[13424.32 --> 13429.28]  just to fill certain gaps that's an idea yep maybe i don't know yep but that's another thing is
[13429.28 --> 13435.20]  like we'll we'll have minor missteps here or there but constant content constantly changes and you're
[13435.20 --> 13438.64]  never going to perfectly hit every time we can learn things move on that's part of the job
[13439.60 --> 13444.72]  i think the content team is doing great i think they're killing it and i think the the views and
[13444.72 --> 13450.08]  general audience sentiment improving reflects that a random physicist says home feeder would be a great
[13450.08 --> 13455.52]  10x video like it's ten dollar home theater based on what you did in scrapyard wars you could do it
[13455.52 --> 13459.36]  do it like there's just that's one of the things with home theater stuff is like
[13461.20 --> 13466.48]  well that guy i think just like took pity on me or something i don't know he knew who you were
[13466.48 --> 13470.88]  oh he didn't at all okay did the audio from that ever go in i don't think so i haven't watched the
[13470.88 --> 13474.88]  full video we have we have the whole thing audio recorded he had genuinely no okay all right all right
[13474.88 --> 13483.84]  i'll allow it i'll accept he thought i was a very weird guy um but yeah there's like old home theater
[13483.84 --> 13488.08]  equipment sometimes people are just trying to move it on that wasn't even old that was actually all kind
[13488.08 --> 13493.28]  of newer stuff anyways that was weird but yeah uh
[13493.28 --> 13497.76]  uh
[13497.76 --> 13506.48]  yeah next would you would you care for a second merch message that's got to be one of the all-time
[13506.48 --> 13512.64]  yeah let's go something a little lighter this time if you don't mind oh uh let me just look uh
[13512.64 --> 13519.44]  what is your opinion on geopolitics uh this might take me a bit to find one would technically still
[13519.44 --> 13525.44]  exist if riley didn't join lmg in 2019 you talked about how it picked up nearly all the lost revenue
[13525.44 --> 13531.84]  from ldt when ldt struggled this one wasn't better would lmg be entirely different now if there was no
[13531.84 --> 13540.16]  tech link i love riley um i didn't see a path toward having that high energy irreverent yet informed style
[13540.88 --> 13549.12]  without riley i basically had in mind what i wanted to do and waited until ncix went to crap and
[13550.00 --> 13558.64]  immediately slid into riley's dms i i don't i who else could be riley yeah tell me that no riley is
[13558.64 --> 13565.44]  riley is a unique a unique pearl that has been grown from a unique piece of sand
[13568.72 --> 13574.08]  do that again luke i'm just saying like how you get pearls like so you had to like crack ncix open and
[13574.08 --> 13576.64]  just like yeah extract the one valuable thing
[13580.16 --> 13583.84]  no no offense to some of my former colleagues that there were there were other pearls
[13585.20 --> 13586.96]  they're just a little misshapen
[13588.08 --> 13594.72]  next uh hey dll as an ignorant american my knowledge you don't have to say ignorant my knowledge of america's
[13594.72 --> 13600.64]  hat comes from media like pure pwnage letter kenny shorzy and ltt
[13600.64 --> 13604.24]  what canadian made media would you recommend i don't know pure pwnage is
[13605.52 --> 13609.20]  canadian i think they were yeah oh we don't even know what's canadian
[13609.92 --> 13614.64]  yeah that's that's a whole thing just assume most of it's american i think friendship is magic is
[13614.64 --> 13622.08]  mostly canadian oh yeah the production was like local like uh riley did a voice in it once oh that
[13622.08 --> 13628.16]  would make sense why he did that okay yeah sure yeah but i i was saying red green yeah yeah yeah
[13628.16 --> 13633.12]  red green uh fred penner probably a pretty dated show at this point yeah i just feel like probably
[13633.12 --> 13639.84]  uh does anybody know the beachcombers is that no yeah some people it might be an old thing
[13641.76 --> 13647.76]  trailer park boys is trailer park boys canadian yeah what yeah i didn't know that yeah that's sick
[13648.56 --> 13654.08]  what's oh yeah stargate what's my aunt was on stargate stargate stargate sick what makes it canadian
[13654.08 --> 13660.88]  though i don't know everything's filmed in canada yeah but like okay but is it culturally canadian really
[13660.88 --> 13668.24]  what is canadian culture we i that's a that's a question right there yeah i think that's hard to
[13668.24 --> 13674.24]  nail down uh in this part of the country i think it's well i mean they have the same issue in america
[13674.24 --> 13680.56]  you can you can drive like 200 miles in america and be like i'm still in texas yeah well no no i don't
[13680.56 --> 13684.96]  even mean that i mean you you can still be in texas and think you're in a completely different country
[13684.96 --> 13691.52]  yeah like and it's it's very much the same here like in the lower mainland i will literally go play
[13691.52 --> 13698.32]  badminton and i'll be like oh yeah i'm the token white guy yeah and then i can drive like you know
[13698.32 --> 13703.12]  four hours to five hours to vernon or something like that and yvonne and i'll walk down the street
[13703.12 --> 13710.32]  and you'll have people be like what the yeah an asian yeah yeah like kids same province dude when she
[13710.32 --> 13715.76]  when she was when she was there for a practicum like little kids would point at her like little
[13715.76 --> 13719.68]  kids dude they don't know better you're gonna do what they're gonna do they don't know better or
[13719.68 --> 13725.44]  anything but it's just like i don't know what the what is what what i think i think you get more
[13725.44 --> 13731.28]  unique canadian culture the more east you go yeah probably more unique yeah like vancouver is
[13732.16 --> 13738.72]  such a mixing pot yeah um not always the most mixed but all the ingredients are thrown in oh yeah
[13738.72 --> 13744.88]  they're all in there yeah like i i i often tell people that it's like stupid for me to travel for
[13744.88 --> 13750.64]  food oh yeah because like dude food in vancouver you just got to pick the like dude if you know what
[13750.64 --> 13754.80]  you want there's a city that will have amazing versions of that like it's always a joke to me
[13754.80 --> 13759.04]  when people are like yeah you have to like eat the raw fish in japan and i'm sitting here going you
[13759.04 --> 13764.32]  know we live on the same ocean right and there's like plenty of japanese people here to like cut up a
[13764.32 --> 13768.48]  fish for me if i really need if that's really what i'm into like i just like what are you talking
[13768.48 --> 13776.40]  about that dude man like indian cuisine asian amazing amazing like all of it the only thing
[13776.40 --> 13782.72]  middle eastern we kind of lack and mexican i was gonna say mexican our mexican i am very jealous
[13782.72 --> 13790.40]  found a new one where tell me don't tell me now okay i'm not gonna tell you now what is he talking
[13790.40 --> 13795.36]  about you're gonna like where it's located as well really i've been getting sick of where we live for
[13795.36 --> 13802.08]  food so i've been trying to find them mostly just for you there's i really really like mexican food
[13802.08 --> 13808.08]  yeah dude you can go to any random hole in the wall in la oh dude it's amazing and you'll get this like
[13808.08 --> 13812.88]  giant thing it'll be like eight dollars nine dollars okay i haven't been down to l if it's up to me
[13812.88 --> 13817.68]  and i'm in the states practically anywhere in the states i will basically just eat mexican food oh yeah
[13817.68 --> 13820.88]  because i know i'm not going to get it when i come back 100 it's like you get like
[13820.88 --> 13826.32]  an enchilada here and it's like this stupid wimpy little thing you go down there you order
[13826.32 --> 13832.32]  enchiladas and it's like a whole plate covered in delicious like sauce and there's like unlimited
[13832.32 --> 13836.56]  pico and a little thing you go get it dude the the pico oh
[13839.12 --> 13844.40]  properly made pico pop properly made guacamole yeah dog oh man
[13844.40 --> 13852.72]  it's so good so yeah we're lacking that yeah yeah we and and to be clear i'm sure you can get
[13852.72 --> 13859.28]  good mexican cuisine probably down in vancouver yeah but what we don't have is like a huge mexican
[13859.28 --> 13865.92]  community here and so that's the difference right like you can get good indian cuisine probably just
[13865.92 --> 13874.64]  about anywhere but you guys don't have surrey where like it's it's cheap and it's everywhere
[13874.64 --> 13881.20]  and it's like honestly super authentic if you just pick a random one it's probably going to be very good
[13881.20 --> 13886.32]  i don't go to random ones anymore i don't either i only go to you start g dude masala and langley
[13886.32 --> 13893.60]  nah man you start g i will i will challenge you to like a curry hole showdown which wait hold on
[13893.60 --> 13899.20]  probably not the best way to be phrasing that i meant like a hole in the wall restaurant
[13900.24 --> 13905.04]  that specializes in curry i know a place
[13905.04 --> 13912.32]  oh
[13914.56 --> 13917.36]  was that intentional yeah tell me was that intentional
[13918.48 --> 13922.96]  um it doesn't look like it was intentional luke i know when it's intentional with linus
[13924.24 --> 13926.64]  oh god the pair of you oh
[13928.16 --> 13934.00]  sure i was thinking like watering holes i know slash hole in the wall yeah yeah exactly it's not a good
[13934.00 --> 13942.08]  that's not curry that comes out of that hole that is not a curry hole oh man i had a really
[13942.08 --> 13945.68]  my favorite one it was in the middle of surrey and they they closed down they changed ownerships
[13945.68 --> 13949.84]  what was it called i cannot remember it wasn't taste of punjab was it no no okay
[13949.84 --> 13953.12]  this was like because then you start g now and their way it's like actually better
[13953.84 --> 13960.72]  you know they change management i think you start g dude dude the owner is a g i am definitely
[13960.72 --> 13964.64]  there's like the weirdest pictures of him in all their i've been to a couple of their locations
[13964.64 --> 13971.76]  wait is that actually their branding is it used g76 yeah oh no scroll down scroll down dude the central
[13971.76 --> 13978.88]  city location keep going keep going the central city yeah yeah what a g oh yeah the central city
[13978.88 --> 13986.80]  location has artificial turf on the wall why i don't know but it also has fairy lights and i love this
[13986.80 --> 13992.56]  man they had uh they had mr bean cartoons on the tv when i went in look at the way he poses in front
[13992.56 --> 13998.80]  of his restaurants this is sick their branding is so inconsistent and they don't seem to give any
[13998.80 --> 14005.20]  that means it's good their garlic naan is perfect the food looks amazing that the picture oh that looks
[14005.20 --> 14012.00]  so good their garlic naan is flawless and unlike mcdonald's the food looks like that no way it looks
[14012.00 --> 14017.20]  exactly like that i will defend i still think misal is great we'll do we'll do both let's do it that
[14017.20 --> 14022.00]  looks so good they pulled food out of their kitchen and they took these pictures i swear to god
[14023.28 --> 14031.76]  that's amazing what is this road it's canada we have one like seriously dude i love their branding
[14034.32 --> 14037.04]  oh they're milestones they look like yeah they're locations
[14037.04 --> 14043.84]  so i didn't become aware of them until they replaced the place i liked to go in surrey central
[14043.84 --> 14048.80]  this website decides amazing oh yeah like what font do you use yes
[14051.20 --> 14058.88]  conrad take notes yeah yeah oh apparently oh okay so that was a grand opening a while ago but
[14058.88 --> 14064.24]  apparently they're in cam loops so there you go anyway you start g like what does this site just
[14064.24 --> 14068.72]  scroll forever what am i even looking at here it seems like who is buddy in the jeans this is their
[14068.72 --> 14074.88]  instagram this is him is that him yeah yeah that that must be him that must be him this is insane
[14074.88 --> 14082.80]  just never incoming call but what is this it's their video it's their food yeah dude okay
[14083.76 --> 14091.92]  you start g we got to the end yeah anyway so yeah i i i love uh i love vancouver i love vancouver food
[14091.92 --> 14095.68]  yeah vancouver food's great yep it's one of the best things it's gonna come and like like okay like
[14095.68 --> 14102.48]  chinese food you can get everything from like like litter like like actual regional styles like
[14102.48 --> 14108.88]  szechuan style or like more like hong kong style like hot pot taiwanese style you know like you can
[14108.88 --> 14114.32]  get like so so like the china area you can get like different styles and then you can also get like
[14114.32 --> 14119.68]  trashy american chinese food you know like you can get your sweet and sour pork and your oil drenched
[14119.68 --> 14124.72]  chow man or whatever like it's of course yeah it's great okay what are we supposed to be talking
[14124.72 --> 14132.64]  about uh i think we're done with that one dll any way to vote on items we would like to see again in
[14132.64 --> 14138.88]  the store i would love to see the black shorts again pre-orders or even kickstarter style where
[14138.88 --> 14144.80]  we need to reach a minimum order size which shorts like the the swimming trunks or the sweatshorts we had
[14144.80 --> 14150.32]  just like shorts the sweatshorts i think they were sweatshorts yeah um i actually had a conversation
[14150.32 --> 14156.96]  with nick uh earlier this week about some of the ideas that we have that we just don't know how
[14156.96 --> 14162.08]  feasible they are like we don't know what the order mix is going to look like in terms of sizing we don't
[14162.08 --> 14168.32]  know in terms of color like is there the possibility of building our own kind of kickstarter style thing
[14168.32 --> 14175.60]  where we basically say okay yeah like our moq for this is 2 000 units if 300 or 400 of you pre-order
[14175.60 --> 14180.96]  or 500 like we set some threshold we basically go okay yeah here's here's where it's at right now
[14180.96 --> 14186.08]  here's how close we think we are here's where we anticipate it'll come out are you down are you in
[14186.08 --> 14190.08]  um yeah i could if you're gonna if you're gonna anticipate when it would come out you have to put a
[14190.08 --> 14194.80]  deadline yeah yeah and then we just refund if it doesn't make it yeah i think this person is
[14194.80 --> 14200.56]  describing a non-deadblind version but yeah yeah interesting i i yeah it sounds like they're
[14200.56 --> 14208.80]  describing more of like a um like a threshold for resurrecting older items uh i we don't have
[14208.80 --> 14214.08]  anything right now but there is the possibility that yeah mass drop style or kickstarter style that we
[14214.08 --> 14223.12]  could we could either bring back high demand items or or do kind of edgier or kitschier stuff that uh
[14223.12 --> 14226.56]  that we're really not sure about
[14230.40 --> 14235.36]  is drop just like a keyboard company now oh no no no no they have other stuff don't forget about
[14235.36 --> 14242.00]  headphones yeah top gear says okay but how long would i have to wait after i order will it be like
[14242.00 --> 14248.32]  backpacks six plus months yes yeah yeah production times are weeks or sometimes months shipping is like
[14248.32 --> 14255.20]  a month it just takes time at sampling they gotta like someone has to like make it like it's one off
[14255.20 --> 14259.76]  you know and then it has to be shipped and then we have to like schedule a meeting and then we have to
[14259.76 --> 14263.28]  evaluate it and then we have to compile our feedback and we have to send it back and then we have to like
[14263.84 --> 14272.56]  make another one like it's making products is uh i i feel like a lot of media and i don't just mean tech
[14272.56 --> 14278.96]  media i feel like a lot of media would have a very different perspective if they had
[14280.40 --> 14289.44]  experience actually created anything yeah a lot of critics create nothing and it's definitely given me
[14289.44 --> 14292.96]  a better perspective yeah
[14292.96 --> 14300.72]  more yeah or not we could just sit here in silence i mean that's an option yeah
[14305.68 --> 14312.88]  so excited to meet monitor kun why can product what what i have no idea why can products that are
[14312.88 --> 14318.48]  still being purchased out of stock on the store i'm gonna give you another crack at this one go ahead dan
[14318.48 --> 14325.92]  why can products that are still being produced be out of stock on the store why not just send it
[14325.92 --> 14334.00]  when it's made after i ordered we are generally not that into taking back orders because our lead
[14334.00 --> 14342.24]  times are so long that we end up creating negativity out of an attempt to provide a service which is the
[14342.24 --> 14351.20]  ability to back order um we're not like we we act more like a manufacturer it's not like we have a
[14351.20 --> 14357.44]  water bottle factory like i don't you know own a water bottle factory but we behave like a manufacturer
[14357.44 --> 14367.92]  in that we um we place large orders we uh have to figure out our mixes we have to warehouse them we have
[14367.92 --> 14372.48]  to market them sell them like we're pretty vertically integrated for a lot of our product stuff which
[14372.48 --> 14379.92]  means that our eta's are dependent on manufacturing and global logistics they're not dependent on
[14380.56 --> 14385.76]  whether our supplier down the street has stock or our other supplier has stock there is no other supplier
[14385.76 --> 14391.68]  a lot of the time we're working directly with factories so it takes as long as it takes and um
[14392.72 --> 14397.84]  you end up creating a lot of work for yourself because no matter how hard you try to disclaim that this
[14397.84 --> 14403.84]  is going to be three months sorry people will message you and be angry about it and then heaven
[14403.84 --> 14408.16]  forbid it lasts longer like we'd rather just take your money once we have something in stock or at
[14408.16 --> 14412.96]  the very least once we know with a fair degree of certainty once we're like when we're going to be
[14412.96 --> 14418.56]  getting it we've made exceptions and honestly it's worked out okay sometimes but not as well other times
[14419.20 --> 14424.96]  word 97 guy in full plane chat said oh man when i was working in the snowplow industry we spent a
[14424.96 --> 14433.04]  year developing the crate it ships in yeah things take time when you start getting into engineering
[14433.04 --> 14441.12]  and development and whatnot things take time and you'll think it'll take six months and then in month
[14441.12 --> 14448.96]  five you'll go oh there's a big problem that we didn't foresee and now it requires re-engineering
[14448.96 --> 14453.52]  the whole iso standard for the size of the bits and the size of the sockets realizing that the entire
[14453.52 --> 14458.00]  rest of the industry was doing it wrong backwards or whatever and we had to decide do we go according
[14458.00 --> 14462.80]  to spec or do we go according to compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem just making that decision
[14462.80 --> 14468.24]  is going to take a lot of how could we see that coming yeah this stuff happens all the time
[14470.08 --> 14480.80]  so like i don't know times a five four hello linus luke and dan as big fan of overcooked i was wondering if
[14480.80 --> 14485.76]  linus had heard of the game plate up it's pretty similar it's also published by some of the youtubers
[14485.76 --> 14493.60]  called the yog cast cast i have not heard of plate up um i know overcooked i know moving out my my kids
[14493.60 --> 14500.40]  really like moving out i play plate up overwhelmingly positive reviews it's phenomenal it's great if you like
[14500.40 --> 14508.64]  screaming at your friends yeah cool so good after having played overcooked i haven't craved more of
[14508.64 --> 14517.84]  that kind of gameplay really personally but um yeah i might be down to try it sometime but i also i don't
[14517.84 --> 14524.64]  know man like i'm old like when i have half an hour to hang out and play a game honestly it's a lot
[14524.64 --> 14528.00]  easier and more comfortable for me to just flip on a game that i already know how to play
[14528.00 --> 14534.08]  dude that you don't need friends for got him i mean like you got to get a group of people together
[14534.08 --> 14541.52]  at midnight right not wow why do you gotta burn me like that we both get first you want to invite me
[14541.52 --> 14548.16]  to say first you uninvite me to your pool party yeah okay rude you weren't invited in the first place
[14548.16 --> 14559.04]  turn it off he's off bye damn bye i'm sorry okay welcome back down we need someone to read the
[14559.04 --> 14567.28]  merch messages okay i need somebody to come to my pool party please hello when rain yeah yeah i'm at
[14567.28 --> 14574.80]  you at lawn party just splash around on the floor hello wan.dll with iphone and pixel promising plus six
[14574.80 --> 14579.92]  years of software updates do you think that they will try and push newer devices harder or increase
[14579.92 --> 14584.64]  the benefits of the new devices and exclude from olders i think they're absolutely going to try to
[14584.64 --> 14591.92]  differentiate the newer products but i think that six plus years of software updates is less um an
[14591.92 --> 14597.76]  action that they are taking to extend the lifetime of these devices and more an acknowledgement that that
[14597.76 --> 14605.12]  is and is becoming the product life cycle for phones and they better just get on board or they're
[14605.12 --> 14609.68]  going to be left behind and there's going to be no one to sell a new phone no one who wants anything to
[14609.68 --> 14614.80]  do with their brand when their competitors are supporting the devices for longer i think this is
[14614.80 --> 14620.80]  a response i don't think this is proactive particularly on google's side apple seems to have slowly
[14621.68 --> 14625.68]  acknowledged this over time you go back to some of the very earlier iphones they didn't necessarily
[14625.68 --> 14630.48]  get this nice long support period but for the most part they do now because apple recognizes that the
[14630.48 --> 14640.56]  value is in building out the size of the install base my company recently got acquired and the new
[14640.56 --> 14647.60]  organization is nothing but egos but i love my team and old co-workers how would you deal with new
[14647.60 --> 14653.28]  leadership causing problems due to the lack of confidence and big ego
[14655.68 --> 14664.00]  it's the same story man you hear it over and over again acquisitions like
[14666.08 --> 14667.92]  private equity um
[14670.48 --> 14670.96]  i don't know
[14672.96 --> 14678.72]  it's tough i'm sorry we've never been in that scenario honestly yeah i mean i've definitely had
[14678.72 --> 14683.44]  friends that have talked to me about you know how the company changed after they're acquired and stuff and
[14683.44 --> 14692.88]  i can't think of too many versions of the story where it ends real good they exist they do
[14694.40 --> 14697.60]  but i haven't heard many of them that it usually ends up real good for
[14698.88 --> 14703.36]  is not the individual workers oh no but that's what i meant yeah i know i know i'm only counting the
[14703.36 --> 14708.72]  stories i've heard from individual workers i'm not counting like the ownership ownership does great when
[14708.72 --> 14717.84]  uh when a company gets acquired that's yeah that's kind of how it works what happens when you run out of
[14717.84 --> 14723.52]  bad shafts for the scribe driver will we just be getting a scribe driver with the primo knurling instead
[14723.52 --> 14730.24]  no the primo knurling is too rough to to hold like in a pen grip buy a screwdriver and then cut off the
[14730.24 --> 14737.92]  head and then machine it myself why don't you just machine a pen extremely expensive scrap driver that's
[14737.92 --> 14743.92]  probably worse i like this yes we've talked about this my life by that luke i thought you knew me
[14746.64 --> 14757.44]  somewhat what i'm referencing we are for my oh never mind we have lots of supply of shafts what is it four
[14757.44 --> 14763.52]  tons this is not a this is not a concern for the time being we have a lot of shaft however
[14763.52 --> 14773.68]  we're not concerned about not having enough shaft uh we we it's okay look it's bad you're not missing
[14773.68 --> 14775.84]  anything it's rough
[14778.96 --> 14787.44]  technically it's ribbed technically it's knurled i think i think that's worse uh anyway the point is
[14787.44 --> 14793.12]  we've got lots but we have talked about this and we would consider making a scribe driver from scratch
[14793.12 --> 14798.64]  but i don't know we're years away from having that conversation i think we've got plenty of scribe
[14798.64 --> 14805.12]  drivers you should take the um you should take the branding from nintendo the like new with the like
[14805.12 --> 14810.08]  multi-colored things coming out of the new do you know what i'm talking about new nintendo 3ds
[14810.08 --> 14814.96]  oh yeah that new scribe driver new scribe driver for now what's new about it
[14817.44 --> 14822.64]  technically nothing but it's made from new things i don't know yeah i guess yeah yeah subscribe
[14822.64 --> 14831.04]  driver uh yeah we'll we'll keep mining for shafts mine shaft shaft mine shaft mine shaft i don't know
[14832.00 --> 14836.80]  there's plenty in the hill of shafts shaft hill shaft mountain
[14836.80 --> 14842.00]  broken shaft mountain that's a great movie
[14844.00 --> 14851.04]  shaft mountain classic uh hi linus luke and dan this is the last one i got for you
[14851.04 --> 14857.68]  i was wondering if you think there is a chance that tsmc will be broken up as a monopoly monopoly
[14857.68 --> 14862.56]  particularly if intel were to pull out of the fabrication space and focus on research and development
[14862.56 --> 14868.32]  so when you break up a company you are you are breaking it up into uh it's like an antitrust
[14868.32 --> 14875.92]  thing right you're breaking it up so that it cannot utilize its advantage in one area to give it an
[14875.92 --> 14883.52]  unfair advantage in another area tsmc for the most part just does one thing you can't break up
[14883.52 --> 14891.52]  tsmc i mean oh hold on you could demand it's so integrated i was gonna say you could demand that
[14891.52 --> 14897.60]  their their r d and like like tool development breaks off from their pure manufacturing but
[14898.88 --> 14905.92]  in silicon they're so serving the one thing parallel and they're so integrated i don't see how you could
[14905.92 --> 14910.56]  ever i also think that would quite genuinely be directly against the interests of the governments
[14910.56 --> 14920.56]  involved yeah like government the government of taiwan is like not going to be interested in that no and i don't care
[14920.56 --> 14930.56]  which one you ask like the more pro-freedom government that is currently in power or a more pro-china government that if they were ever to manage to win somehow uh
[14931.12 --> 14934.88]  none of them would be interested at all in
[14934.88 --> 14945.60]  disrupting disrupting tsmc's current just like march to complete global semiconductor domination here
[14950.00 --> 14956.80]  yeah yeah they're not going to disrupt that that would be unwise on like so many different levels
[14956.80 --> 14965.68]  thank you so much for tuning into the land show yeah we're gonna see you guys again next week yeah
[14965.68 --> 14978.80]  same bad time same bad channel yeah bye
[14986.80 --> 14993.04]  bye
