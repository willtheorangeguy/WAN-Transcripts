I will often comment on a topic during the video, having not watched it entirely 1st but I do finish almost all of the videos.
This being the prime eg.
Timestamp & percentage would be *GREAT*

[2024-08-24T18:16:44Z] Video: NVIDIA Proved Me Right - WAN Show August 23, 2024 
Timestamp 1:31:21. Everyone becomes compost, now some earlier than others. ðŸ˜‚

[2024-08-24T11:15:39Z] Video: NVIDIA Proved Me Right - WAN Show August 23, 2024

the comments and amount of video watched. With that logic, this comment would be ignored because i'm not at 50%.
I get your point though and there is really no perfect implementation. A timestamp of the comment similar to soundcloud would be enough.

[2024-08-24T10:41:29Z] Video: NVIDIA Proved Me Right - WAN Show August 23, 2024 
3:33 Minors? Of course? Moving later on?
Is this one of those YouTuber things?
(Edit for correct timestamp)

[2024-08-24T09:49:50Z] Video: NVIDIA Proved Me Right - WAN Show August 23, 2024 
1:19:20 YouTube does store the timestamp of comments, itâ€™s just not visible. On mobile you will see relevant comments to a part of the video you are watching rotate by, and the comment doesnâ€™t need a timestamp in it. YouTube should show timestamps of comments on the opposite side of the commenter username.

-This was a WIP as I had to attend somewhere; the initial raw version may not be as accurate atm as I timed this during my live watch.-

Let me know of sub/topic rephrasings/suggestions/corrections, if any.
For low-volumed Linus-muted portions, rather than raise the volume, I suggest turning on the automated captions; they're at least great at catching low-volumed statements w/o exploding your ears the next line.

There's a site (YTC) where you can search comments for YT videos so you can find timestamps in the sea of comments easier, in case this or anyone else timestamping happen to not appear immediately.
