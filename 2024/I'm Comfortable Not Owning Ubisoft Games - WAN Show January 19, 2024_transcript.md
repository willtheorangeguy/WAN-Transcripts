[0.00 --> 3.94]  And welcome to the WAN show. We've got a lot of great topics today.
[4.42 --> 5.54]  Ubisoft says,
[6.20 --> 12.74]  Gaming subscription success requires gamers to be comfortable not owning games.
[14.44 --> 19.52]  I mean, I for one am comfortable not owning their games, if that's their attitude about it.
[19.52 --> 19.94]  Yeah, I think that's what this means.
[20.56 --> 24.00]  In all seriousness though, they're probably going to win this, but anywho.
[24.00 --> 24.50]  I don't know about that.
[24.50 --> 30.28]  It has been officially confirmed now, search engines are in fact getting worse.
[30.36 --> 34.16]  A recent study revealed that, yeah, it's not just Google.
[34.36 --> 35.78]  It's across the board pretty much.
[36.02 --> 38.04]  What else we got today? Did I manage to steal your two?
[38.22 --> 39.40]  You sure did.
[40.16 --> 44.10]  And then I found a makeup one and I lost it.
[44.10 --> 49.90]  Fujitsu agrees it is morally culpable in 700 plus wrongful convictions.
[50.60 --> 50.90]  Ooh.
[50.90 --> 54.88]  Which is a rough thing to agree to.
[56.02 --> 62.92]  Also, everyone's been raging at YouTube for going after their computer performance.
[63.14 --> 64.58]  And it was an ad blog bug.
[65.24 --> 65.54]  Whoops.
[65.86 --> 66.64]  We'll talk about that.
[66.64 --> 91.62]  the show is brought to you today by divoom ag1 and oh no i missed it
[91.62 --> 101.40]  i missed the last one odd pieces tremendous why don't we jump right into our headline topic today
[101.40 --> 109.84]  and that is that ubisoft uh during an interview about the launch of the new ubisoft plus premium
[109.84 --> 113.26]  and classic subscription okay hold on actually we're gonna get into this in a second
[113.26 --> 123.56]  shout out ubisoft okay i don't think anyone puts more work into rebranding their bullshit
[123.56 --> 131.82]  than ubisoft okay you got what how many names has their stupid launcher ever had
[131.82 --> 137.00]  guys hit us in the chat okay i think it was you play at the start
[137.00 --> 147.48]  the look on your face by the way amazing um ubisoft connect is one of them uh no i don't so
[147.48 --> 157.30]  i think it's ubisoft connect now i am bear goes it's not you play anymore no no no formerly ubisoft
[157.30 --> 162.54]  game launcher yeah i think that's what it started as yeah okay okay yeah that's according to
[162.54 --> 169.28]  tonyb486 in the float plane chat it's ubisoft plus now it's not even ubisoft connect ubisoft plus
[169.28 --> 177.52]  uh okay uh hold on i think the game launcher is still called ubisoft connect i don't think we can
[177.52 --> 182.18]  take everything float plane chat is saying is gospel truth skate rubin says was it origin at one point
[182.18 --> 184.58]  no that was ea
[184.58 --> 191.34]  yeah it's not it's not ubisoft plus it's it's ubisoft connect ubisoft plus is their subscription
[191.34 --> 196.80]  service those are that we're talking about the launcher right now um the launcher was originally
[196.80 --> 203.08]  called ubisoft game launcher and then you play you play was actually a good name in my opinion uh they
[203.08 --> 210.08]  had an online pass called you play passport okay uh this was back in like 2012 or 2013
[210.08 --> 217.22]  you play plus a monthly subscription service that gave you access to over 100 games in the ubisoft
[217.22 --> 223.58]  catalog was introduced at e3 2019 cool uh and then hope you like far cry and far cry derivatives
[223.58 --> 228.98]  in october 2020 this is all from wikipedia so take it for what it is probably fine in october 2020
[228.98 --> 236.42]  apparently you play and ubisoft club were merged into ubisoft connect that makes sense and then
[236.42 --> 246.20]  has part of the ubisoft plus what um wow uh so anywho let's get back to um the launch of the new
[246.20 --> 253.34]  ubisoft plus premium and classic subscriptions what the f**k these things are i don't know without
[253.34 --> 257.78]  looking them up i assume they are some kind of subscription service that may or may not have
[257.78 --> 263.90]  anything to do with their launcher cool their director of subscriptions oh my god they have a
[263.90 --> 269.30]  director of subscriptions because of course they do i've got it i've got the difference between
[269.30 --> 274.22]  classic and premium all right help me out so classic in canadian dollars is 10 bucks a month
[274.22 --> 280.20]  and premium is 20 bucks a month in classic you get a selection of 50 plus can you hold on can you
[280.20 --> 286.52]  help me out with something really quick here sure how many games does ubisoft actually launch every year
[286.52 --> 290.96]  that's why i said far cry and far cry derivatives one thing to note though is that they are a
[290.96 --> 293.68]  publisher don't forget about assassins creed and assassins creed derivatives
[293.68 --> 297.08]  assassins creed at this point is basically a far cry derivative
[297.08 --> 303.56]  hot take here we go this is coming from someone who likes assassins creed okay that's but they all
[303.56 --> 311.14]  just follow the go to the tower reveal the map continue forward model i see yeah anyways no i
[311.14 --> 316.28]  haven't forgotten about i know the most recent one i haven't forgotten about ano that's actually just
[316.28 --> 320.58]  published by ubisoft though so that that's they are a publisher and they do publish a decent amount
[320.58 --> 326.38]  of games yes people like track mania yeah all right okay okay but now hold on just a gosh darn
[326.38 --> 336.20]  second here because 20 a month last time i checked is over 200 a year it's a lot of money actually so
[336.20 --> 344.08]  given that pc games only cost you know full price if you are buying nintendo games or you can't wait like
[344.08 --> 351.82]  two weeks um you could buy like most of the games that ubisoft releases that year and just doing a
[351.82 --> 357.24]  premium subscription would cost me more than i spend on ubisoft games a year and i buy the games that i
[357.24 --> 363.54]  want to play like i'm not i don't i don't cheap out on games so i guess what you're trying to say is
[363.54 --> 370.12]  that a better value for people's money would be a float plane subscription yeah we finally did it guys
[370.12 --> 375.82]  we finally interviewed the new ceo yeah he's six months into the job now it took a little bit new
[375.82 --> 381.18]  okay maybe not so much but definitely in the grand scheme of things grand scheme of things definitely
[381.18 --> 386.04]  new it's up on float plane it's over an hour long it ended up running a lot longer than we had sort of
[386.04 --> 390.12]  yeah then we'd sort of planned to uh we took questions from the community i also came up with
[390.12 --> 395.02]  someone my own and we kind of like riffed a little bit yeah yeah it was fun it was good that's cool so
[395.02 --> 399.60]  that's up on float plane along with a whole bunch of other great exclusives um so they're director
[399.60 --> 407.04]  of subscriptions i'm trying a new thing i ah man i actually feel really bad because i told i told
[407.04 --> 413.54]  riley and jessica okay i want to help you guys make clips better so i want to try and keep the topics
[413.54 --> 423.02]  stop stop with that face i'm gonna stop okay i'm gonna stop i'm gonna try and make the topics uh
[423.02 --> 428.20]  as clean as i can without random digressions intentions that's never gonna happen you just
[428.20 --> 436.36]  have to cap it off well i think i have made it work either uh 19 words into this topic
[436.36 --> 444.88]  and have already gone on two major digressions i'm very sorry um i will do better ubisoft's director
[444.88 --> 451.18]  of subscriptions philippe tremblay observed that in order for video game subscriptions to really take off
[451.18 --> 459.12]  a consumer shift needs to happen where gamers get more comfortable not owning their games just like
[459.12 --> 465.34]  other consumers got comfortable not owning their cd collection or dvd collection now
[465.34 --> 474.66]  in fairness to mr tremblay that's a good point i am perfectly comfortable at this point
[474.66 --> 482.84]  not owning a cd collection i do not need a cd collection what would i need it for so that i
[482.84 --> 488.84]  can have a bunch of random plastic in my house so that i can get up like a caveman when i want to
[488.84 --> 494.56]  listen to a different track on a different plastic disc do you archive music that's important to you
[494.56 --> 502.88]  because you archive movies that are important to you i only archive movies on a central server
[502.88 --> 510.50]  that you're not so much of a music guy i mean i listen to music every day yeah for probably but
[510.50 --> 516.86]  are you like that into it over an hour a day yeah i wouldn't describe myself as into it i spend far
[516.86 --> 522.60]  more time listening to music than i do watching movies yeah but i think that's much more casually
[522.60 --> 531.08]  for me um it's less about the casualness or not casualness or honestly even the time spent doing it
[531.08 --> 538.84]  and it's more about the uh the convenience if i could stream blu-rays with the touch of my finger
[538.84 --> 543.76]  the way that i can stream an mp3 then i wouldn't bother to have those on a server in my house either
[543.76 --> 548.40]  i wouldn't care are you not concerned about any of it going away i think that's less of a risk with
[548.40 --> 553.94]  music it's more of a risk with movies i think that my immediate reaction and this is going to be
[553.94 --> 561.52]  probably a little unpopular with someone um is that if a streaming service and uh i believe youtube
[561.52 --> 566.20]  music i know google play music had this where if you had something in your likes or in your playlist
[566.20 --> 570.22]  or whatever else and it was removed from the platform it would leave a ghost like it would
[570.22 --> 575.28]  leave a stub that it was there so you would never lose that oh yeah that was a song i like to listen
[575.28 --> 580.54]  to that had some significance or whatever um and then what i would what i would do immediately
[580.54 --> 585.18]  if a song was pulled off of the service that i use because i'm not going to subscribe to more than
[585.18 --> 591.42]  one is i would just go pirate it upload it to the service which google play supported and i believe
[591.42 --> 597.24]  youtube music may also support i can't remember i haven't had to do it in a long time i know youtube
[597.24 --> 601.62]  music can do local play sure well i wouldn't bother with that that would be too much work but but
[601.62 --> 606.12]  google play music you could upload it to your own yeah private cloud i don't know if that works
[606.12 --> 611.48]  anymore and then yeah i remember that so i had like two songs that weren't available on google
[611.48 --> 616.22]  play music one of which i actually bought on itunes because it was the only place i could find it
[616.22 --> 622.38]  and the other one i think i i ended up finding a download for it on a pirate site because it wasn't
[622.38 --> 628.32]  available on any streaming service so i was just like well okay then the only actual way i can get it
[628.32 --> 632.10]  that's how it's well i could have bought the cd and i could have ripped i could have ripped the file
[632.10 --> 637.56]  but i was not going to buy a whole album for one song and i believe all of the i believe those songs
[637.56 --> 642.82]  are now on youtube music and so i i no longer actively do that but i can tell you if something
[642.82 --> 645.86]  disappeared from my playlist that would be the first thing i would do because i'm just i'm not
[645.86 --> 651.44]  interested um as for as for movies i think i just i kind of recognize the data delivery challenges
[651.44 --> 657.22]  with having an on-demand just like instant blu-ray stream doing the same quality as a blu-ray yeah
[657.22 --> 661.32]  be very expensive and you know what's really interesting is we've talked about this already
[661.32 --> 669.28]  on the show but i'm seeing that discourse start to gain traction people are putting the hats on dude
[669.28 --> 674.92]  like hey oh no i don't mean that oh i mean that i i mean i'm i'm seeing people start to recognize
[674.92 --> 682.20]  how crappy netflix looks oh yeah and like as there was a whole thread i i i saw recently of somebody
[682.20 --> 688.58]  who bought a blu-ray as like almost a joke and then they watched it at home and they were like uh
[688.58 --> 695.42]  i'm going back yeah yeah because it looks like garbage yeah well no it looks amazing no i mean
[695.42 --> 701.44]  netflix looks like garbage by comparison and nothing against netflix they are it's a technological marvel
[701.44 --> 709.66]  honestly i mean that yeah but it's there's there's just limitations 4k is not 4k in all situations
[709.66 --> 718.54]  1080p is not 1080p yeah there's more factors than that yeah and blu-ray looks really really good
[718.54 --> 725.14]  especially the like 4k uhd blu-rays man i watched alien for the first time uh i have did i talk about
[725.14 --> 731.28]  this on when show before i'm not sure i i finally watched it right before ces i had never seen alien
[731.28 --> 740.72]  before and i watched it on that tcl tv i watched a blu-ray it was incredible it looked so good
[740.72 --> 747.04]  i i just i don't think i could watch i don't think i would even want to watch a movie like that
[747.04 --> 754.58]  streamed from netflix like the the the ambience of it it's gorgeous it's yeah yeah it's amazing
[754.58 --> 761.36]  spectacularly i had managed to avoid almost all spoilers for it too like i just
[761.36 --> 766.76]  i got to watch it with fresh eyes it's kind of fun i don't think this increases convenience at all
[766.76 --> 773.80]  though like this this isn't coming back to you no this isn't gamers going from discs to
[773.80 --> 780.38]  to streaming services this is completely different no and hold on a second because
[780.38 --> 786.40]  there is more that mr tromblay said he said part of that is gamers feeling secure in the knowledge
[786.40 --> 792.06]  that they won't lose their progress that their files won't be deleted and that they won't lose
[792.06 --> 802.98]  what they've built in the game and there's the problem they will yeah they do yeah uh here hold on
[802.98 --> 809.32]  from ubisoft this has happened hold on servers shut let's let's okay here it is ubisoft
[809.32 --> 814.24]  shutting down uh hold on decommissioning of online services for older games okay here here here
[814.24 --> 818.56]  here here's uh here's a post from uh ubisoft
[818.56 --> 829.18]  okay so assassin's creed 2 is no longer available let's find something okay anno 1404
[829.18 --> 834.52]  wait hold on if you've pre you will see hold on hold on hold on what am i looking at online
[834.52 --> 840.36]  services for older yeah okay so online services are closed for these games anno 1404 america's army
[840.36 --> 846.20]  uh that was only on xbox that one a bunch of assassin's creed games uh were retired between
[846.20 --> 857.72]  2014 and 2022 beyond good and evil um far cry 2 shut down man actually a lot of far cries uh far cry 3
[857.72 --> 865.10]  the 2012 release so for 10 years for 10 years 10 years is a long time 10 years is long enough that
[865.10 --> 871.72]  you could be 16 when you play this game and you could be 26 by the time they shut it down but here's
[871.72 --> 878.22]  the problem with that what if you're 26 27 you're like oh yeah i want to like go experience that the
[878.22 --> 884.14]  way that i originally experienced it that game might have aged kind of rough but lots of games don't to be
[884.14 --> 890.86]  honest yeah like when did civ 5 come out what about just dance three kids okay probably not a good
[890.86 --> 897.52]  example so if i came out in 2010 so it's over a decade old yep i play it every once in a while still
[897.52 --> 902.94]  yep that's not even nostalgia glasses and you know what i mean when i was talking about how i was
[902.94 --> 908.72]  comfortable with this whole uh subscription service thing for music yeah that is a big part of why i'm
[908.72 --> 916.00]  comfortable with it because over time the quality of the library has improved not gotten worse
[916.00 --> 923.04]  although i have a lot that i could say about the youtube music i was just gonna say the app got a
[923.04 --> 932.16]  lot worse the app got youtube music is spectacularly worse rash compared to google play music if they just
[932.16 --> 938.46]  brought back the google play music app so much better i would just i would i used to be like
[938.46 --> 943.04]  evangelical about it like people talk about how shopify was so great and i'd be like you have i
[943.04 --> 948.04]  think you mean spotify spotify sorry you have not heard of the google play music let me show you the
[948.04 --> 954.02]  ways yeah uh did i mention it comes with youtube premium yeah and then they trashed it and i was like
[954.02 --> 960.08]  well i'm never showing this off again because i'm happy it comes for free with premium i will not pay for
[960.08 --> 966.94]  two just like you said yep but it's a lot worse than spotify so it is what it is um so yeah a big
[966.94 --> 973.26]  part of why i'm comfortable with it is that convenience and and trusting that the service
[973.26 --> 978.14]  is going to continue to exist and also that if it doesn't then i could just jump ship to spotify
[978.14 --> 984.44]  yeah or i don't know like title title somewhere somewhere there's a few uh apple apple music i could
[984.44 --> 990.06]  just i could just jump to something else whereas with ubisoft well okay a these games are
[990.06 --> 996.96]  their own games on their own platform um so i if for whatever reason i don't like what they're
[996.96 --> 1000.76]  doing with the platform there is no competition that i could jump to whether it's you know price
[1000.76 --> 1008.86]  increases or or cutting the library or whatever else it is and i don't trust that those things are going to
[1008.86 --> 1016.02]  be maintained there's no reason to trust that all of the precedent has been that they won't be
[1016.02 --> 1023.50]  so like like very extensive precedent from a huge multitude of companies has been that it won't be
[1023.50 --> 1028.26]  our discussion question is what would it take for you to trust a company that has this kind of power
[1028.26 --> 1030.86]  over your gaming library and i think we both know the answer
[1030.86 --> 1041.62]  no oh okay well i know the answer i want a commitment in writing that if any online services
[1041.62 --> 1048.52]  are to be terminated that they will be either open sourced or there will be a good faith effort
[1048.52 --> 1055.90]  to negotiate with the gaming community to hand over the tools to continue that service uninterrupted
[1055.90 --> 1060.26]  i just don't think it's ever going to happen well i didn't look i didn't say it was realistic i just
[1060.26 --> 1065.96]  said yeah that is right though i do agree that's what it would take yeah for me to trust them to just
[1065.96 --> 1070.88]  be like yeah it's all subscription now you you own nothing with that said it's not like it's really
[1070.88 --> 1073.52]  any different if you buy it you're still just renting it
[1073.52 --> 1080.30]  not always less the online services you are because they can just shut them down at their discretion
[1080.30 --> 1086.56]  yeah but if they did sign that thing well then i'd be fine with that too but yeah i just mean it's
[1086.56 --> 1090.18]  not an option in either case our options right now are to give them all our money up front
[1090.18 --> 1097.02]  or to give them our money over time to not give them all our money ever is that today that's this
[1097.02 --> 1107.88]  month wow you know what i will see it it does it's the oh i really
[1107.88 --> 1120.08]  wow i hold on can you go back to that for a sec this really bothers me so from here
[1120.08 --> 1126.12]  look at the y-axis on this chart yeah yeah okay so that's good go to the one month one
[1126.12 --> 1133.52]  i hate that yeah this should be one is that we started zero should be zero yeah i um there's there's
[1133.52 --> 1138.78]  an app that i use for monitoring stock prices not because i own stocks but just because it's
[1138.78 --> 1144.60]  interesting i i follow the tech industry and if i'm not paying attention to you know who's
[1144.60 --> 1148.32]  wow amd is
[1148.32 --> 1156.42]  remember that computex video i made where i was like you should invest in amd by the way this is
[1156.42 --> 1162.38]  not financial advice or whatever anyone who invested in amd at that point i think that it's like it's like
[1162.38 --> 1166.86]  a four bagger now or something like that anyway the point is i do pay attention to it and one of
[1166.86 --> 1174.02]  the things that i i don't do this very often but i noticed that i didn't like about the app and i
[1174.02 --> 1179.50]  actually went out of my way to message the developer of the app and ask you know hey i'm i don't happen
[1179.50 --> 1182.80]  to be a paying customer of yours because i don't need any of your premium features because i'm just a
[1182.80 --> 1192.20]  looky lou but um i would love to be able to fix the bottom of the y-axis at zero because otherwise
[1192.20 --> 1199.68]  it makes the swings in value look enormous when in some cases they actually aren't that large
[1199.68 --> 1203.66]  because some investors they might want to see that view though because it might be trading on that
[1203.66 --> 1209.54]  level so that's valuable sure fair enough but but on that level also need to be able to see can
[1209.54 --> 1217.62]  still be distorted because the thing is that not all stocks uh have a price that is directly
[1217.62 --> 1221.74]  comparable like depending on how many times it's been split for example totally so you could have
[1221.74 --> 1227.50]  a stock that's priced at six hundred dollars and it could have fluctuated from five hundred and eighty
[1227.50 --> 1233.22]  to six hundred and ten and it could look like this giant line and then you could have another stock
[1233.22 --> 1239.36]  that's priced at around seventy dollars and went from thirty to seventy and it looks like that same
[1239.36 --> 1246.98]  line but that's actually a really big difference yeah and they were like nah my big thing here okay
[1246.98 --> 1258.26]  is actually this but that's what i was looking at negative 15.72 percent year to date yikes that's the
[1258.26 --> 1264.36]  that's the like oh all right did anyone buy amd when i made that video someone in flow plane chat
[1264.36 --> 1269.78]  said they made a killing on amd and in nvidia eric r underscore c says it's more like 10 times when
[1269.78 --> 1277.10]  you made that video worksman o2 said my nvidia stock purchase is up 13 000 oh 1300 he corrected it
[1277.10 --> 1288.66]  that's crazy uh bean 710 i did just checked jonas yes mad powder i'm up over 100 percent
[1288.66 --> 1299.00]  i wanted to but like can't because work and stuff oh man but i was i was yeah oh man all right yeah i i
[1299.00 --> 1304.78]  i was look i think i made it clear at the time and i've made it clear since then i am not a financial
[1304.78 --> 1311.78]  advisor i am not an analyst or whatever but i was looking at it back then going dang it's not so
[1311.78 --> 1317.64]  much that amd's roadmap looks great it does look great it's more that intel's roadmap looks like
[1317.64 --> 1324.62]  absolute doggy yeah and it's a duopoly people are going to need processors people are going to need
[1324.62 --> 1330.22]  computers yeah yeah uh oh man
[1330.22 --> 1342.14]  j529 says which stock should i buy right now brother i want i don't know no financial advice no i'm not
[1342.14 --> 1348.94]  i'm not giving any financial advice i i man i can't believe what's been going on with nvidia lately
[1348.94 --> 1355.10]  it's crazy i mean i shouldn't say i can't believe it i i do believe it it makes sense because
[1355.10 --> 1361.50]  they are a money printing machine basically every wafer that they can possibly get from tsmc
[1361.50 --> 1369.20]  what what was it rumored facebook was buying billions billions of gpus for their ai endeavors
[1369.20 --> 1374.42]  if i remember correctly google passed uh their salary expenditure on hardware
[1374.42 --> 1381.46]  really i i i remember let me try to find this that's insane
[1381.46 --> 1392.24]  meanwhile twitch chat would you recommend i invest my money in cs2 weapon skins
[1392.24 --> 1395.76]  yeah i mean honestly maybe i don't know i don't know anything about that but
[1395.76 --> 1401.04]  yeah uh november 24th google reportedly now spending more on computer power than people
[1401.04 --> 1409.04]  yeah expect that to be a trend that continues yeah it's kind of scary yeah um
[1409.04 --> 1413.42]  oh man hold on i was gonna i was gonna say something um
[1413.42 --> 1418.30]  oh shoot no
[1418.30 --> 1426.26]  yeah yeah i left it hey do you remember when we had that private conversation where i was like
[1426.26 --> 1430.36]  i really like the direction intel's going if i was a stock buying person i would buy intel
[1430.36 --> 1435.26]  and i think it was i think it was with you you told me hey i know someone who knows something
[1435.26 --> 1441.36]  about something and they're like no no no no man until it's like way up since then when would this
[1441.36 --> 1445.88]  have been uh like over a year ago it was a while back basically it was around the time that pat
[1445.88 --> 1452.18]  gelsinger took over oh i don't remember this at all yeah okay yeah that's fine um yeah the point is
[1452.18 --> 1457.68]  they are they are on a very different trajectory than they were um and i think the argument of that
[1457.68 --> 1461.48]  person was something something arm something something data center something something and i
[1461.48 --> 1466.12]  was like yeah but i don't think you've really understood his vision for the company his vision
[1466.12 --> 1471.50]  for the company is to continue to be intel and also to be tsmc
[1471.50 --> 1479.50]  um which is a pretty big deal which is a kind of a big deal so in the last uh because like if nvidia
[1479.50 --> 1487.38]  is making big fat stacks so is tsmc yep and then by intel's logic so should they yeah to be clear
[1487.38 --> 1493.12]  i'm not saying to do that today i i have no idea you know if it will continue on the trajectory that
[1493.12 --> 1499.08]  it's on and that would be a much longer term play i think a lot of people um stock more like gambling
[1499.08 --> 1504.18]  like they're expecting a payoff in six months or three months or a month or a day there's this whole
[1504.18 --> 1509.86]  thing where like current generation uh sees effective forms of gambling is the only way to
[1509.86 --> 1517.38]  make it so like yeah that kind of checks out man i was i read this interesting article about how
[1517.38 --> 1526.72]  there's pretty much a generation of people now for whom competing and winning in a mr beast challenge
[1526.72 --> 1532.44]  seems like a more realistic way to change their situation in life than hard work because hard work
[1532.44 --> 1543.76]  is just not not effective yeah and it's like this is why i said what i said um back when jimmy was
[1543.76 --> 1548.22]  facing a bunch of backlash for something stupid i can't remember what it was where i was just like
[1548.22 --> 1552.86]  yeah he's young he's like he's gonna make mistakes like i i told him beast burger was a mistake
[1552.86 --> 1560.62]  flat out i was like dude no um and he figured it out eventually so good on him for that like he he makes
[1560.62 --> 1567.50]  mistakes but i think i i said i think his heart's in the right place i think i think jimmy donaldson
[1567.50 --> 1577.10]  for president i think he no i stop i think he cares about helping people and i think that i think that
[1577.10 --> 1584.98]  he's the kind of person who looks at a resource like money and goes well yeah but like couldn't we
[1584.98 --> 1591.02]  just use this really effectively to make people's lives better and he's doing it on a really really
[1591.02 --> 1599.52]  small scale that you know you can you can talk all day about you know um uh image uh sanitization
[1599.52 --> 1606.86]  with philanthropy or like you know the uh the the the corruptness of donations and blah blah like you can
[1606.86 --> 1611.02]  kind of you can kind of attack from any different i don't i don't know him at all i think he would
[1611.02 --> 1617.26]  struggle really hard with the overpowering amount of corruption that there is in governmental systems
[1617.26 --> 1620.62]  i won't even say american governmental systems i'm just gonna say governmental systems in general
[1620.62 --> 1625.20]  yeah i think that's very just like let's use our money in this way yeah and then you have to go
[1625.20 --> 1631.16]  through the armies of people that are in between you and that actual spend that are going to try to
[1631.16 --> 1635.66]  take all their own cuts that are going to try to scam it in whatever various way like all these
[1635.66 --> 1641.28]  there's a lot more war right now than there has been over the last while in general just all around
[1641.28 --> 1646.16]  the world um and something that keeps cropping up every time one of these countries gets into
[1646.16 --> 1651.86]  a war-like situation is like wow the generals for all these various companies were really scamming
[1651.86 --> 1657.68]  the whole country really hard this whole time um for the generals for the companies countries countries
[1657.68 --> 1660.84]  yeah like if i remember correctly it was like uh
[1660.84 --> 1667.32]  i don't actually want to get into details but like yeah it's this it's this whole billions and
[1667.32 --> 1672.24]  billions of dollars from multiple different countries not not just like it's it's yeah it's
[1672.24 --> 1678.28]  really bad yeah i i think you're referring to a situation where there was some country whose
[1678.28 --> 1684.84]  military on paper was a lot better than it ended up being based on how much money they were spending on
[1684.84 --> 1689.54]  it because there was a lot of misappropriation of funds there's also multiple countries that this has
[1689.54 --> 1695.16]  happened to and it's like oh yeah turns out it's like pretty much all of them was it you who was
[1695.16 --> 1699.36]  telling me that like the the u.s military pays hundreds of dollars for garbage cans or something
[1699.36 --> 1704.58]  like that oh no it was it was way more than hundreds of dollars um is it was it garbage cans it was a
[1704.58 --> 1711.84]  garbage can yeah okay i thought it was 30 grand shut up no trash can hold on no stop the pentagon's
[1711.84 --> 1722.12]  52 000 trash can okay here we go i'm going to your laptop uh sure yeah okay it's on y combinator where
[1722.12 --> 1729.36]  does this responsible statecraft hold on i think that was the top link yeah military spending record
[1729.36 --> 1735.46]  highs and contractors hiked up the cost of relatively simple items i love that cute little dollar tank
[1735.46 --> 1747.84]  oh man uh so in 2020 the pentagon paid boeing over 200 000 for four trash cans yeah okay yeah this is
[1747.84 --> 1752.82]  it when the 707 fell out of use in the united states the trash can was no longer a commercial item
[1752.82 --> 1757.38]  meaning boeing was not obligated to keep its price at previous levels according to the weapons industry
[1757.38 --> 1762.10]  so the trash cans became roughly 51 606 dollars per unit
[1762.10 --> 1775.22]  the company charged 36 640 each for 11 trash containers resulting in a total cost of more than 400 grand
[1775.22 --> 1786.48]  and how much is a band-aid at a hospital yeah that stuff is rough too okay okay hear me out
[1787.38 --> 1797.48]  jimmy donaldson running mate the ghost of bernie sanders because he'll probably be dead by the time
[1797.48 --> 1806.58]  jimmy's i was like what's happening no did that happen no no no not i just i think the biggest like
[1806.58 --> 1812.20]  reform that could happen in a lot of countries right now is like getting scams like this out of
[1812.20 --> 1816.66]  government spending because you look around and you're like there's a lot of taxes
[1816.66 --> 1822.76]  taxes all the time you know it's just everything gets taxed a lot all the time what does that go
[1822.76 --> 1826.96]  into and it's like genuinely hard to figure out and then you read stuff like this and it's like oh
[1826.96 --> 1836.66]  cool i mean that boeing executive has to wipe his ass with money somehow yeah yeah i guess right yeah
[1836.66 --> 1841.06]  meanwhile twitch chat's takeaway here is i'm hearing invest in mr beast
[1841.06 --> 1847.46]  never change twitch chat yeah yeah yeah love you guys um
[1847.46 --> 1856.28]  yeah so uh things are frustrating and stuff okay and you don't own games anymore lolt got them all
[1856.28 --> 1863.00]  right second topic did you want to pick one uh it's yeah i i i i i hate to bring them up
[1863.00 --> 1865.98]  actually i don't at all i love it but i'm gonna do it anyways um
[1865.98 --> 1872.44]  bg3 has spoken out against this um boulders gate 3
[1872.44 --> 1878.76]  i i i mean larian studios oh okay sven himself specifically i hope i'm saying that right
[1878.76 --> 1887.16]  um sven's a pretty common name then uh let me try to find the tweet i'm hearing invest in trash
[1887.16 --> 1888.12]  can manufacturing
[1888.12 --> 1898.56]  um okay uh it's doing that thing where it's serving me all the tweets out of order because
[1898.56 --> 1902.00]  i'm not logged in nice i'm logged in i think
[1902.00 --> 1910.40]  ubisoft subscription not okay to its credit typing x.com legitimately is faster than typing twitter.com
[1910.40 --> 1912.68]  oh cool i'm never gonna remember that
[1912.68 --> 1919.12]  i can't find it i think i can find it through my phone hold on
[1919.12 --> 1933.62]  is this brian adams and taylor swift no way
[1933.62 --> 1940.04]  yeah so sven sven said uh whatever the future of games looks like content will always be king it's
[1940.04 --> 1944.46]  going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a
[1944.46 --> 1950.54]  select group gets to decide what goes to market and what does not direct from developer to players is the
[1950.54 --> 1958.26]  way getting a board to okay a project fueled by idealism is almost impossible and idealism needs room
[1958.26 --> 1963.50]  to exist even if it can lead to disaster subscription models will always end up being a cost benefit
[1963.50 --> 1969.06]  analysis exercise intended to maximize profit there's nothing wrong with that but it may not
[1969.06 --> 1975.84]  become a monopoly of subscription services um we we are already all dependent on a select group of
[1975.84 --> 1980.28]  digital distribution platforms and discoverability is brutal should these platforms all switch to
[1980.28 --> 1984.96]  subscription it'll become savage in such a world by definition the preference of the subscription
[1984.96 --> 1990.06]  service will determine what games get made trust me you really don't want that tldr you won't find
[1990.06 --> 1994.24]  our games on a subscription service even if i respect that for many developers it presents an
[1994.24 --> 1998.80]  opportunity to make their game i don't have an issue with that i just want to make sure the other
[1998.80 --> 2008.52]  ecosystems don't die because it's valuable what a chad move we will not do this this thing sucks
[2008.52 --> 2016.14]  we want to build our games in the idealized way that we want to build them sick they just keep doing
[2016.14 --> 2026.60]  cool stuff man ah so cool i don't know i just wish they made games other than that yeah because i kind
[2026.60 --> 2032.78]  of couldn't understand that but they're yeah i mean that's fair it's just not really your style of game
[2032.78 --> 2037.84]  which is fair but it's still a fantastic game i i'll say i'm gonna take another run at it i'll take
[2037.84 --> 2043.48]  another run play it with yourself or like with me or something it's it's a huge time commitment it is
[2043.48 --> 2051.24]  huge and like uh it's a big deal and like if you really want to enjoy it a lot of it's like even
[2051.24 --> 2061.86]  the game that shall not be named yeah the the amount of like places yep and mechanics and the controls
[2061.86 --> 2070.10]  and stuff if you play a game for one hour and then like like i mean a new game like a modern game
[2070.10 --> 2077.54]  where it's not just like the tutorial is here's how to wasd control for crouch mouse to look like
[2077.54 --> 2085.30]  play a modern a modern game that in a genre that you don't normally play okay play it for one hour
[2085.30 --> 2088.94]  you won't even probably hard for some of these nerds you won't probably even be through the
[2088.94 --> 2095.96]  tutorial go away don't touch it for two weeks yeah come back play another hour there can be some
[2095.96 --> 2100.54]  learning curve go away don't touch it for two weeks i kind of come back and play another hour
[2100.54 --> 2109.04]  how do you it's so hard to get into it yeah yeah i i don't want them to
[2109.04 --> 2116.82]  to like weaken it though to be completely no i get it yeah i get it it's it's a hardcore game for
[2116.82 --> 2122.34]  hardcore gamers yeah 100 it's really really deep and they have a lot of systems going on so there's
[2122.34 --> 2127.02]  going to be some level of complexity i don't think it's too bad though and i'm i'm actually kind of
[2127.02 --> 2133.24]  like wondering what you got hung up on um it's like there wasn't a large learning curve for original
[2133.24 --> 2138.92]  sin for me and or divinity and you played divinity and had no problems with it so like i well
[2138.92 --> 2143.32]  i i mean i was just kind of tagging along with you like it was that was the that was the tutorial
[2143.32 --> 2146.54]  we were just talking to people and like i played dragon age
[2146.54 --> 2155.46]  yeah i don't know i think a big part of it might have been because i was playing with um a non-gamer
[2155.46 --> 2160.28]  this is what i'm saying i no i can't i get it i get it i get it i get it so on the one hand we were
[2160.28 --> 2166.40]  going extremely slow sometimes and on the other hand we were like blitzing through areas that are just
[2166.40 --> 2171.36]  like you know you you're like my gamer sense is tingling i should be doing this thing we need
[2171.36 --> 2177.90]  to talk to these people yeah uh wow this is a really non-methodical way of going through this
[2177.90 --> 2184.26]  settlement that is clearly designed to be walked through this way you know like that yeah yeah yeah
[2184.26 --> 2187.06]  that's part of it but also i i just
[2187.06 --> 2198.84]  i look at that game i see it in my library and it looks like i am gonna spend at least 30 percent of
[2198.84 --> 2204.12]  this gaming session googling controls trying to remember what was happening last time
[2204.12 --> 2209.36]  trying to figure out where the crap i am and honestly i'd rather just shoot some heads in halo
[2209.36 --> 2216.00]  see like yeah i can't like tell you you're wrong but i feel like something's because of the power
[2216.00 --> 2220.56]  dynamic in our relationship because that's that's what people will assume no because you're afraid
[2220.56 --> 2228.98]  to speak truth to power oh my god no it's just like you can't tell from his body language you can't
[2228.98 --> 2232.42]  tell someone who's like i'm having a hard time with this he actually fears me
[2232.42 --> 2242.12]  we spent like the entire video we were filming before this just trashing on each other
[2242.12 --> 2252.20]  so yeah you you can't like tell someone who's like this is difficult for me that they're wrong but
[2252.20 --> 2256.44]  i do i'm wondering if there's like something in particular that you're hitching on
[2256.44 --> 2262.18]  that i could just solve for you and then it would be over they said to blink if you need help
[2262.18 --> 2268.52]  oh my goodness um yeah it's nothing in particular i you know what okay all right all right all right
[2268.52 --> 2277.70]  all right all right i'll play it you don't have you don't like look i i'm a man of my word i i
[2277.70 --> 2283.00]  watched pirates of silicon valley i watched that other stupid crappy movie uh what was the third
[2283.00 --> 2287.54]  thing that i said i would do i played through the campaign of titanfall 2 that was good i i committed
[2287.54 --> 2292.64]  i committed and i did them and i mean you know you don't seem to feel the same way about your
[2292.64 --> 2299.66]  commitments oh my goodness my computer cannot run the game stalling out i will i will play it soon
[2299.66 --> 2304.74]  sure i mean theoretically i'm getting that other one yeah that esper can save itself oh my goodness
[2304.74 --> 2312.44]  oh my goodness i actually really want to play it i have the you you lent me that controller it's sitting
[2312.44 --> 2318.40]  right next to my mouse pad because i like want to play it but i just i can't i found out he was
[2318.40 --> 2325.34]  playing on a keyboard and i was like brother i got really good at the whatever um yeah i got actually
[2325.34 --> 2330.18]  very good at the combo yeah well like i emma asked me what i was doing one time because i was playing it
[2330.18 --> 2334.06]  i was like going so fast and she's like what's happening i was like i just memorized all the inputs
[2334.06 --> 2339.88]  don't tell him it's a lot easier on a keyboard it is actually way easier on a keyboard so it's time to
[2339.88 --> 2345.30]  actually have to deal with occasionally inputting a combo incorrectly which i feel like it's actually
[2345.30 --> 2348.96]  correct because the reason why it's easier on a keyboard is because it's like broken and the
[2348.96 --> 2354.50]  reason he's so powerful is because there's a chance to enter the combo wrong yeah and you're trying to
[2354.50 --> 2359.34]  go quickly because you have to get to the next action input like i want to play it properly like
[2359.34 --> 2364.66]  when i'm when you're doing it on a keyboard it's like okay you go left and then angled left and then
[2364.66 --> 2371.86]  down you you actually just go left down down because there's no angled left so i i don't know
[2371.86 --> 2379.16]  if it takes left or down you can also just roll them the hole or at least that was true in emulators i
[2379.16 --> 2385.46]  i my first time beating that game was not on my snes with my cartridge because i lost my super
[2385.46 --> 2391.04]  nintendo when i moved to my mom's house i never i never got it back i have no idea whatever happened
[2391.04 --> 2398.56]  to that super nintendo so um as a kid i got stuck on the floating continent every time and i stop
[2398.56 --> 2407.36]  i know this won't be a spoiler okay and i didn't know that you can cast magic outside of battle
[2407.36 --> 2416.36]  okay yeah so there's a particular dungeon that's rough at a particular stage in the game when potions
[2416.36 --> 2424.44]  are like a little bit of health a little bit of health and you could only hold 99 of any particular
[2424.44 --> 2428.96]  item in your inventory so i would make it halfway through this stupid dungeon and run out of potions
[2428.96 --> 2434.82]  because i didn't know i could just cast cure outside of battle and uh or eventually had the older sibling
[2434.82 --> 2441.96]  of one of my friends like help me with it like can you pass this for me and my jaw just about hit
[2441.96 --> 2445.50]  the floor the second he cast out of battle the second they open up the skills menu because then
[2445.50 --> 2452.80]  you're like oh i could have obviously done this yes i haven't found it like particular the town i'm
[2452.80 --> 2459.80]  in right now is the hardest by a massive amount oh yeah zozo's zozo's a bitch yeah yeah everything
[2459.80 --> 2467.46]  else been honestly pretty easy um what are we talking about right now not a clue boulder's great gate
[2467.46 --> 2474.04]  three i oh because they they 40 and slip boulder's great three it is yeah no only water can get
[2474.04 --> 2478.88]  through they they were looked at a little bit weird for not like joining game pass and doing
[2478.88 --> 2483.00]  oh great oh that's really good
[2483.00 --> 2489.52]  i was trying to continue the topics i didn't like try to even bother understand what it was
[2489.52 --> 2495.08]  um they were questioned a little bit as far as my understanding goes for not joining like game pass
[2495.08 --> 2500.56]  and stuff like that so i already knew they kind of had this stance but to reaffirm the stance in the
[2500.56 --> 2505.00]  light of this i think is very cool because i think it's pretty important and i think
[2505.00 --> 2514.52]  in my opinion the quality of shows and tv and movies and stuff has maybe been dampened a little bit by the
[2514.52 --> 2521.60]  subscription model um and i strongly agree with what he was saying about how that would happen to gaming
[2521.60 --> 2531.12]  because what's going to get funding is whatever can sell predictably yeah or whatever will will be
[2531.12 --> 2535.72]  able to be played whatever's gonna for many hours retain subscribers on the subscription model yep
[2535.72 --> 2542.56]  so things like daily login rewards and stuff that keep people wanting to stay subscribed is going to be
[2542.56 --> 2553.04]  the things that get uh you know allowed to be made so that's not fun i don't like that cool
[2553.04 --> 2557.60]  all right dan did we ever do a second topic
[2557.60 --> 2565.64]  what was it uh that was ubisoft says gaming subscriptions require gamers to not own games no
[2565.64 --> 2571.38]  that was the first topic uh wasn't your second topic the bg3 one no that's not that's a that's not
[2571.38 --> 2576.18]  the topic so no we never did a second okay well let's talk about the ssd shortage that's expected
[2576.18 --> 2582.98]  this is not financial advice but buy lots of ssds there's your next investment don't don't actually
[2582.98 --> 2587.86]  don't that's a sell them on the street corner i i i i know they say it's non-volatile
[2590.50 --> 2591.22]  where's my ding
[2594.34 --> 2600.66]  but don't do that uh prices of high capacity ssds are projected to spike by
[2600.66 --> 2607.86]  15 to 20 percent due to a shortage of four and eight dynand packages while some of this price
[2607.86 --> 2612.74]  increase is already hitting retail it may be two to three months before the impact of these supply
[2612.74 --> 2619.86]  shortages hit consumers fully it is possible that this is a downline consequence of makers of 3d nand
[2619.86 --> 2628.18]  cutting production due to previously low demand notably 2023 was a no good very bad year for sales
[2628.18 --> 2633.78]  of electronics however some oems have significantly scaled up their purchases of ssds as of this
[2633.78 --> 2641.30]  quarter meaning that well low supply high demand what happened to pricey he go up um
[2642.58 --> 2646.98]  our discussion questions how should users looking for an ssd deal with these kinds of shortages
[2646.98 --> 2655.70]  i would say that if you're on the fence um i would probably pick up an ssd now but understand that
[2655.70 --> 2664.66]  overall price for in general price goes down price for um price per capacity price for nand storage yeah
[2665.38 --> 2671.62]  generally go down so i i would not actually recommend it as an investment yeah but if you're
[2671.62 --> 2676.18]  like i've been thinking about getting one and you feel like you probably will within the next x amount
[2676.18 --> 2680.98]  of months maybe do it sooner than later speaking of investments it's time to find out how much i made
[2680.98 --> 2689.94]  on my lego roller coaster what oh nothing what okay it's apparently still worth exactly what it was when uh
[2690.90 --> 2697.54]  when i bought it i don't understand what's happening well lego retired sets can do really well oh
[2697.54 --> 2701.46]  okay yeah so you bought one right before it retired well i bought one of these like three years ago we
[2701.46 --> 2706.02]  only just finally finished building it because we lost a couple of pieces in the move well we lost
[2706.02 --> 2710.90]  a couple pieces before the move and then it was exacerbated by the move anyway we finally it's so
[2710.90 --> 2718.90]  cool this thing is so cool the cats love it like he's just do things actually like roll yeah it has a
[2718.90 --> 2723.06]  yeah it has a it has two trains or cars or whatever whatever they're called it goes
[2723.06 --> 2731.86]  do the cats just like watch it they watch it sometimes they bat at it they brownie in particular
[2732.42 --> 2737.86]  freaking loves it i'll you just you just sit there and it's so fun i'm watching him he's watching the
[2737.86 --> 2744.50]  coaster and i'm just turning the crank like moving the bringing the cars up to the top and he's just like
[2745.94 --> 2752.10]  like watch he's like so into it like sometimes he like goes at the mechanism for the uh for the track
[2752.10 --> 2758.18]  that drags the uh the trains i guess what the heck are they what's the word for that carts trains
[2758.18 --> 2763.22]  whatever trains uh drags the trains up the hill and then sometimes he like it's like watching
[2763.22 --> 2770.74]  it goes and he like stops it on the track it's great i love it so much fun um i don't know maybe
[2770.74 --> 2779.06]  in another 10 years the vehicle is called the train all right good but yeah lego lego retired kits can be
[2779.06 --> 2785.54]  uh it can be a very strong investment i think that just collecting hobbyist crap would be a really fun
[2786.18 --> 2792.42]  hobby slash investment do you think ip based ones would probably do better than like roller coaster
[2793.86 --> 2799.46]  it like there was like the office set i feel like that might do pretty well i don't know man i don't
[2799.46 --> 2803.86]  know what i don't know if the office is gonna be maybe not the office maybe maybe there's some like
[2803.86 --> 2810.02]  i would say the kid ones are the stronger ones yeah so kid today nostalgia tomorrow yeah i don't
[2810.02 --> 2817.06]  think you're gonna have the same kind of nostalgia for a michael scott lego figurine necessarily but
[2817.06 --> 2821.46]  then you never know because a big part of what makes something collectible is how many they sold and
[2821.46 --> 2827.62]  maybe the office set was not particularly popular or maybe it was i actually just don't know uh but no i i
[2827.62 --> 2834.58]  would say the big ones are gonna be the ones that are the hotness for kids right now there was a
[2834.58 --> 2841.62]  3 500 pokemon card for sale like it was insane uh if you think that's insane you should look up pokemon
[2841.62 --> 2849.54]  cards for sale that doesn't even sound very high z biggie you can't use it linus that completely
[2849.54 --> 2855.86]  destroys the value all right well i'm over it i i i'm having my like 500 worth of fun with it for sure
[2855.86 --> 2862.50]  my kids are my kids are enjoying it a ton i i am i am very anti collect it and put it on a shelf and
[2862.50 --> 2866.74]  never look at it and make sure it doesn't have too much light and never touch it and never do anything
[2866.74 --> 2875.06]  with it i'm not i'm not into that i don't like it yeah all of luke's collectibles are digital he's big
[2875.06 --> 2882.98]  into nfts i was like huh remember nfts yeah good riddance to bad rubbish
[2882.98 --> 2887.70]  oh my i honestly okay
[2891.30 --> 2896.98]  when i found out how much the value of the like first tweet nft had gone down it was like a couple
[2896.98 --> 2907.78]  hundred dollars a part of me was like yeah sure you know like i like i i the the idea of that it
[2907.78 --> 2912.34]  had been worth so much and that i bought it for so little was kind of amusing which is funny yeah and
[2912.34 --> 2917.62]  i was like i i would consider buying a couple of nfts for like thirty dollars or whatever like at at
[2917.62 --> 2924.26]  this stage in the game i didn't end up buying any because it seemed like it's just a lot of work
[2924.26 --> 2929.86]  dumb you're literally just like i could burn a hundred dollars or a couple hundred dollars or whatever
[2929.86 --> 2936.90]  yeah there's no actual value i i you you've heard me give my spiel to my kids now right multiple times
[2936.90 --> 2944.18]  yeah every single time we play halo really no yeah i don't think so uh okay fine then you should
[2944.18 --> 2951.78]  probably be able to recite it oh man i don't really pay attention remember we don't do that we do if you
[2951.78 --> 2956.26]  if you can't earn it whatever something see it clearly hasn't sunk in okay i'll have to do it more
[2956.26 --> 2962.50]  often i don't need it it's always in the form of a question okay yeah okay do we spend money on
[2962.50 --> 2971.94]  things that we can't touch or even own no no okay and then we're is that a smart thing to do no why
[2971.94 --> 2976.66]  not you know like yeah like like it's a whole it's a whole it's a whole thing it's good it's a whole
[2976.66 --> 2983.62]  thing good i don't even i think it gets in my personal opinion i think it gets a little bit nuanced
[2983.62 --> 2988.50]  sometimes because i look at like how much value i got out of the thing sure like i think i've
[2988.50 --> 2992.50]  talked about this before but i bought some seasons passes for rocket league and i think that was a
[2992.50 --> 2997.46]  good thing to do because i got the game on some insane sale for like five bucks and then i played
[2997.46 --> 3005.22]  the heck out of that game so it like felt correct to contribute more to the thing yeah that's totally i
[3005.22 --> 3009.78]  didn't do it because i was like oh my god i want my skins for my car and then psionics got bought by
[3009.78 --> 3014.74]  epic games yeah yeah so i guess that worked out great for you well i mean psionics got more money
[3014.74 --> 3018.26]  or the valuation was potentially worth more whatever whatever like i'm still fine with it yeah now you
[3018.26 --> 3022.66]  can't buy rocket league on steam so good job luke i still have it on steam it's entirely your fault
[3022.66 --> 3027.70]  they didn't take it off of steam if you already had it well yeah but like okay not my son wanted to
[3027.70 --> 3032.98]  get rocket league it's like yo how do i get rocket league i'm like well didn't you already have it
[3033.54 --> 3037.86]  yeah but he doesn't use my account anymore oh yeah he has his own account now and i was like okay
[3037.86 --> 3044.42]  yeah we guess we could put epic game store on the computers and then i like explained how i
[3044.42 --> 3048.34]  didn't really want to have like a bazillion launchers on these things and he was like oh yeah forget it
[3050.18 --> 3051.70]  good kid yeah yeah
[3054.42 --> 3059.22]  uh no you do not have to have epic installed to play rocket league on steam i didn't think so
[3059.22 --> 3064.02]  not not the last time i did it it's been quite a while i haven't played no you do not okay yeah no
[3064.02 --> 3072.10]  you don't um all right we're supposed to explain and do two merch messages but before we can do that
[3072.98 --> 3075.06]  i finally have done it
[3077.06 --> 3081.22]  what hold on i'm just heading to linus tech tips dot com oh
[3082.10 --> 3088.66]  uh oh um hold on a second see if i can uh see if i can find something
[3088.66 --> 3096.34]  uh here we go here we go wait lines tech tips dot com here we go here we go here we go oh i see
[3096.34 --> 3099.62]  i have changed you changed it everywhere my profile picture
[3102.42 --> 3109.38]  big change i know revisionist history what no that's not revisionist history i'm being erased
[3109.38 --> 3117.14]  would you like to know why i did such a thing yes thank you for playing along for a change
[3117.14 --> 3120.98]  you are such a butthead about this stuff sometimes
[3123.22 --> 3128.02]  i know the answer i know the answer i don't need the setup it's here ladies and gentlemen
[3130.10 --> 3136.98]  we have named this latest garment that you uh were noticing earlier on in the show
[3139.06 --> 3144.10]  oh i've been like sweating in here wearing that yeah stupid hoodie over top of this thing yeah we're
[3144.10 --> 3150.18]  calling it the steve it looks pretty good of course it does it's a city store yeah what are you
[3150.18 --> 3158.66]  talking about yeah um it's not just any turtleneck okay the steve is a mock neck with a seam up the
[3158.66 --> 3169.46]  middle like the iconic mock neck that the one and only mr steve jobs famously wore oh yeah it's a whole
[3169.46 --> 3174.10]  thing some designer was like oh yeah that's really important to have that seam up the middle oh it
[3174.10 --> 3181.30]  has a little mac address logo yeah yeah i like that it's not like a crazy it's not like super tall
[3181.30 --> 3186.02]  yeah it's a mock it's got a little bit oh i didn't know but look at this i mean it looks good how cool
[3186.02 --> 3194.18]  it looks perfect horse posing with the imac oh i love it this is a great photo shoot oh no windows i enjoy that
[3194.18 --> 3201.06]  that's fun uh yeah so there it is very subtle but it's there
[3202.66 --> 3207.86]  this is great man everyone really got into the whole props thing with this shoot yeah
[3208.98 --> 3214.74]  ariana from hr oh wow we got a lot of people participating in the shoot this time
[3214.74 --> 3225.30]  and that's the last one nice anyway so i i have finally i have finally updated my profile picture
[3225.30 --> 3230.10]  uh maria took this for me today during the shoot i think i probably could have gotten the facial
[3230.10 --> 3234.82]  expression a little bit better you know i think like i think i should have been down a little bit
[3234.82 --> 3241.78]  more and like i don't know but uh it we we did we did it pretty quick and realistically it looks better
[3241.78 --> 3248.18]  than the old one so i think that original picture that i took that was a still from an old episode
[3248.18 --> 3257.78]  of net linked which was the news uh like roundup that we did still are you sure ncix tech tips yeah it
[3257.78 --> 3266.66]  was it was a still from a video where i borrowed billy from rma's glasses and i forget why i was doing
[3266.66 --> 3271.62]  like a steve jobs pose but it had something to do probably with the news that week and the
[3271.62 --> 3277.54]  video started zoomed in on me and then zoomed all the way out and i like break character completely
[3277.54 --> 3282.10]  you know what's funny is that picture has actually been a source of controversy over the years
[3283.62 --> 3294.58]  i have seen on not one not two but many occasions people criticize me for having that like steve jobs
[3294.58 --> 3301.22]  pose profile picture because it illustrates that i have some kind of messiah complex
[3301.78 --> 3307.86]  and believe that i am an innovator on the level of mr jobs what the are you talking about
[3309.54 --> 3317.30]  it's just a funny picture is meme is the is meme is okay yeah uh anyway
[3317.30 --> 3325.62]  we uh but i thought i took the picture but i guess it was just net linked so i was probably
[3325.62 --> 3332.02]  pressed record once yeah so we we put we put probably way too much work into this garment it's
[3332.02 --> 3339.62]  been in development for over a year it's really nice it looks nice yeah it's like it's super nice it's a
[3339.62 --> 3345.14]  little on the heavier side you know like it's um isn't that usually what a shirt like that would be
[3345.14 --> 3349.94]  though that makes sense yeah but it's but it means it's a completely different garment right like we
[3349.94 --> 3354.42]  couldn't we couldn't just use material nope we couldn't use previous materials we couldn't use our
[3354.42 --> 3360.18]  previous patterns because it has a very different neck uh so getting stupid neck right without it like
[3360.82 --> 3366.90]  bunching up or whatever like we went oh god we went through so many samples um getting getting the look
[3366.90 --> 3376.10]  right so we what we discovered is that the fit of the original was very boxy not very modern so we
[3376.10 --> 3381.86]  moderned up the fit a little bit but without losing too much of kind of the original look um
[3383.14 --> 3390.98]  yeah it's i don't know it's it's a really cool shirt and uh as it turns out it's really hard to obtain
[3391.70 --> 3396.02]  if you want to get one of the originals it was like some japanese designer of some sort the the
[3396.02 --> 3400.26]  fashion team knows way more about it than i do and if you want one of these they're like hundreds of
[3400.26 --> 3406.98]  dollars um so ours is i don't remember how much ours is yeah you can see it i had no idea there was that
[3406.98 --> 3411.70]  middle seam yeah here's the laptop but it's hard to see in this format it's probably not even going to
[3411.70 --> 3417.46]  open yeah it's there though you can you can technically see it yeah that's a it's a fashion seam
[3417.46 --> 3425.22]  sure it keeps all the fashion in nice that's good it's very important so it's 25 bucks apparently oh okay
[3425.22 --> 3435.22]  that seems pretty reasonable we also have tall sizes really no way yeah way apparently i'm getting
[3435.22 --> 3442.26]  a mock neck yeah way brother so that's another thing is we uh we finally did tall sizing i mean how are we
[3442.26 --> 3449.46]  going to have mr jonathan horst promote this product being that makes sense six four that makes sense
[3449.46 --> 3456.66]  um unless we and we're not going to not make one that fits me dang it because i am an innovator on
[3456.66 --> 3462.26]  the same level as mr jobs otherwise why would i pose like this in a silly profile picture because your
[3462.26 --> 3472.42]  profile picture on a forum is to be taken 100 seriously i don't think the size guide has tall oh really oh
[3472.42 --> 3478.66]  um yeah it does where i don't know maybe here tall
[3482.58 --> 3486.42]  you good oh what is the oh the top category doesn't have a
[3487.38 --> 3493.78]  section title okay i understand cool see you later there's body length in the top ones width i guess
[3493.78 --> 3501.54]  anyway the point is that we are about to talk to you about merch messages all you got to do to
[3501.54 --> 3506.34]  interact with the show is send a merch message in the checkout there will be a little box whenever
[3506.34 --> 3512.02]  we're live you can send a merch message it'll go to producer dan oh nice sweater dan it's not from
[3512.02 --> 3516.58]  ltd store though so i'm sorry i'm gonna have to cut your feed um it'll go to producer dan where he will
[3516.58 --> 3521.94]  either forward it to someone who can address it answer it himself or curate it for me and luke to
[3521.94 --> 3528.02]  address later on the show to show you guys how that works he's gonna give you a couple curated merch
[3528.02 --> 3534.82]  messages right now hit me dan sure thing hi dll many of my peers are very pessimistic about the tech
[3534.82 --> 3540.82]  industry many layoffs too much ai etc where do you think the tech industry is going and how do you
[3540.82 --> 3549.78]  deal with pessimism in general layoffs and ai and then ai leading to more layoffs and layoffs necessitating
[3549.78 --> 3558.58]  more ai okay no no hold on hold on how do i deal with pessimism bad linus dad um i mean we're still
[3558.58 --> 3567.22]  hiring yeah i mean a lot of places that are doing these layoffs still have job postings um a lot of the
[3567.22 --> 3573.14]  layoffs are not just in dev yeah that's pretty significant amount of the layoffs are not dev they're
[3573.14 --> 3580.18]  from tech industry but tech industry has a very high population of like sales and admin staff and
[3580.18 --> 3585.46]  marketing marketing and all this other stuff as well community management things that are not necessarily
[3586.34 --> 3595.54]  tech even if they are necessary appendages uh of of an organization yeah um
[3597.22 --> 3599.06]  i don't know there's there's still
[3601.94 --> 3606.90]  there was there was like this metric in a lot of like fang and silicon valley companies for a while
[3606.90 --> 3613.14]  for a lot of managers where a a key performance indicator of that manager was how much they could
[3613.14 --> 3619.14]  swell their head count um how much they could hire effectively and as far as my understanding goes
[3619.14 --> 3625.46]  this is all just hearsay um so i have no idea but as far as my understanding goes that being a metric
[3625.46 --> 3633.06]  is not popular anymore uh because money is not as easily accessible anymore so there was kind of a
[3633.06 --> 3638.02]  strategy where if you increase your head count that means it's going to be harder for other companies to
[3638.02 --> 3647.70]  get that talent um however talented that talent is um and the head count strategy has stopped being a
[3647.70 --> 3652.50]  thing money's harder to get all that type of stuff so they're trying to reduce head count uh but they're
[3652.50 --> 3660.10]  doing so by these like big cuts which you know are are not going to be able to be 100 accurate so um
[3661.14 --> 3666.02]  some great people are going to get cut out um some not great people are going to get cut out who knows
[3666.02 --> 3672.34]  when you're cutting a thousand people at once bad things are going to happen um so it sucks it's bad but it's like
[3672.34 --> 3681.14]  like the the jobs are easy to get and you will have a job at whatever enormous company forever
[3681.14 --> 3688.58]  era is probably kind of over but it doesn't mean there isn't a job market anymore um ai is helping
[3688.58 --> 3694.58]  developers sure it's also helping tons of other industries and it's not replacing developers or at
[3694.58 --> 3699.14]  least it's not replacing like senior developers and they're going to need senior developers somehow so
[3699.14 --> 3706.10]  yeah gregory h asked a similar question uh first time rich message i'm studying comp sci with all the
[3706.10 --> 3710.50]  layoffs do you think that the field is too inflated and i think you probably addressed that um
[3712.26 --> 3718.66]  pretty well at this point i mean yeah there's still jobs out there if you're good there's always a job um
[3719.46 --> 3727.46]  if you are willing to learn and cross train there's always a job for you it's not like these companies
[3727.46 --> 3735.06]  aren't still making a lot of money yeah oh yeah in some cases record profits yeah which is why i keep
[3735.06 --> 3740.50]  i keep bringing it back to this strategy thing um and a lot of them are still hiring handyman in
[3740.50 --> 3749.22]  flowplane chat said oh amazon used to hire um sdes in 2020 to 2021 with one 30 minute interview
[3749.22 --> 3759.62]  which is like whoa interesting we're more thorough than that go team yeah so
[3762.90 --> 3768.58]  it's just it's not gonna be like that anymore um but i mean that's what a lot of industries are like
[3769.94 --> 3775.22]  you know not one 30 minute interview whatever else um it's gonna get more competitive it doesn't mean
[3775.22 --> 3782.82]  it's not there though you still get a job all right dan howdy dll podcast listener here enjoyed
[3782.82 --> 3788.42]  the call out to computer chronicles a few weeks back which of your videos do you want to serve as
[3788.42 --> 3800.66]  a resource for future generations of techies oh i'd like to think that a lot of the archival content is
[3800.66 --> 3808.58]  going to unintentionally be a resource and in a in a what it was like back then kind of way i mean
[3808.58 --> 3812.98]  obviously we don't think about things that way when we're it's already like that when we're making
[3812.98 --> 3820.10]  these videos but uh we shot a video today uh reacting to our best builds as voted by the community
[3821.22 --> 3827.86]  and there is a ton of stuff that i forgot yeah a bunch of stuff that luke and jake had forgotten about
[3827.86 --> 3833.54]  um things i just kind of haven't thought about in a long time like what a great benchmark the tomb raider
[3834.02 --> 3839.22]  reboot games were dude they just they used those for years they scaled with everything yeah you know
[3839.22 --> 3847.14]  add a better cpu fps go up add a better gpu fps go up add a second gpu fps go up just like yeah sure
[3847.14 --> 3853.30]  i'm not oh i'm not i'm not i'm not give me computer power but also running great yeah on you know pretty
[3853.30 --> 3861.86]  pedestrian gaming grade hardware great game fantastically scaling um i'd like to think that
[3861.86 --> 3870.02]  how to build a pc the last guide you'll ever need is going to continue to be an extremely strong point
[3870.02 --> 3876.42]  of entry for people into the pc building and gaming pc gaming hobby it's uh it's at 10 million views now
[3876.42 --> 3881.22]  and going strong like every day it's on our top 10 viewed videos for that day even though it was
[3881.22 --> 3888.02]  released like a year two years ago or something like that and i have a plan we are going to update it
[3890.98 --> 3896.74]  with like video replacement no because that's you can't do that oh that's too much of a change you
[3896.74 --> 3902.98]  can't have floaty well yeah sure got them let's go yeah super relevant video platform there good job
[3905.06 --> 3908.50]  hey man you're supposed to do the business model in marketing so that's on you yeah i just didn't
[3908.50 --> 3913.62]  have this mock neck yet oh there you go now i could there you go there you go this gives this gives me
[3913.62 --> 3926.90]  superpowers uh uh sorry sorry you gotta channel it yeah there you go power level over 9 000 um oh thanks dan
[3926.90 --> 3930.10]  just in time our producer everyone
[3933.14 --> 3934.50]  well he's got the belittling down
[3938.02 --> 3942.02]  okay now i just need a completely curable cancer and then i need to treat it with vegetables
[3944.02 --> 3948.66]  you can cure it with grape welches if we could find any oh he got a few today
[3948.66 --> 3952.66]  oh that's like you separated them out i did get a few today um
[3955.30 --> 3960.42]  okay yeah too soon maybe uh anywho uh what am i supposed to be talking about right oh yes
[3960.42 --> 3966.74]  so the plan we're gonna re-upload it oh right the video yes the how to build a pc the last guy you'll
[3966.74 --> 3971.62]  ever need because it was aspirational that title the last guy you'll ever need i mean things are going
[3971.62 --> 3974.74]  to change it's a computer industry i mean now we have motherboards with the connectors on the
[3974.74 --> 3980.58]  flipping back i was going to say yeah people are pushing for that yeah exactly so the plan is to
[3980.58 --> 3988.18]  is to leave that one up because it still has very good residual traffic basically label it 2022
[3988.74 --> 3993.06]  you know replaced or you know put a link to the new one in the description and then we're going to take
[3993.06 --> 3998.18]  that project with all that super high quality footage and all the incredible amount of work that
[3998.18 --> 4004.18]  the team did we're going to watch it through make notes okay here's what we need to here's what we
[4004.18 --> 4009.14]  need to update here's what probably might not be as relevant anymore so here's what we can can
[4009.14 --> 4013.62]  here's what we can add because of the way we shot it which was not intentional at the time but is going
[4013.62 --> 4020.74]  to work out great with multiple hosts on multiple sets we can just shoot new sections
[4022.18 --> 4028.82]  drop the old b-roll on top of the new a-roll get any new b-roll we need and with comparatively
[4028.82 --> 4035.54]  speaking a relatively reasonable amount of work update it so that the last guide you'll ever need
[4035.54 --> 4044.42]  becomes an evolving piece of content i am yeah i'm super excited one thing that we need to do more of
[4044.42 --> 4049.30]  though and that i realized how to build a pc the last guide you'll ever need doesn't address is like
[4050.26 --> 4056.90]  the little picky parts and one of our other 10 million view videos is the pov build guide
[4058.26 --> 4064.42]  i need to just put a camera on my forehead again and do it again from time to time because that's a
[4064.42 --> 4071.22]  bit outdated now and there's a lot of things that are more easily understood from a first person
[4071.22 --> 4077.78]  perspective compared to um from a third person perspective
[4079.86 --> 4083.86]  oh all right can do brother
[4086.82 --> 4090.02]  do you want to jump into search engines are getting worse
[4090.02 --> 4102.10]  he does but he needs a second do i i think so yeah i do like a passionate topic of yours okay uh
[4102.10 --> 4109.54]  refresh the page if you know you know cool all right um a recent study from researchers in germany
[4109.54 --> 4116.90]  have found that search results are getting worse across all search engines the study followed product
[4116.90 --> 4123.22]  reviews and this is something that i have noticed a lot the quality of the results that i get when
[4123.22 --> 4130.10]  i'm trying to find information on a product has been atrocious but that's just anecdotal right it's
[4130.10 --> 4136.50]  sample size of one it's not a controlled experiment in any way well they controlled the experiment they
[4136.50 --> 4144.50]  followed product reviews on various search engines including google bing and duck duck go and found a
[4144.50 --> 4151.38]  consistent downward trend in the number and the quality of relevant search results and they say this
[4151.38 --> 4161.70]  is due primarily to massive amounts of seo spam what's funny is that i thought that the issue was just
[4161.70 --> 4167.78]  advertising and to be clear advertising is a barrier that sits in the way of finding the information that
[4167.78 --> 4176.50]  you're actually trying to get but i didn't consider that the seo game is still very much alive and well
[4176.50 --> 4188.10]  and if anything greatly empowered by ai oh yeah so attempts to address this problem by google and others
[4188.10 --> 4194.18]  did have a measurable impact on the amount of spam and google's tactics outperformed its competitors but
[4194.18 --> 4201.14]  that effect was both minor and temporary according to lily ray a senior executive at digital marketing
[4201.14 --> 4207.78]  agency mciv digital we are currently experiencing some of the worst results he's seen in his entire
[4207.78 --> 4214.82]  career in part because of an increased emphasis on user-generated content and away from authoritative
[4214.82 --> 4221.46]  sources well that's because uh as as handyman and a couple other people have been saying in chat for a long
[4221.46 --> 4227.54]  time the best way to get results was to append reddit um but and i don't know why seo optimization took
[4227.54 --> 4233.30]  so long to figure this out to be honest it was kind of weird but they have since hijacked that as well
[4233.30 --> 4240.58]  or attempted to it still works pretty well but this has created a major opening for scammers and spammers
[4240.58 --> 4245.46]  yeah um and our discussion question is is there a way to fix this
[4245.46 --> 4252.50]  yeah i don't think so because the only way to fix the quality of information
[4253.30 --> 4260.90]  in the written web is for there to be any money in creating quality content for the written web yeah
[4260.90 --> 4269.38]  and there isn't no the money is in just crapping out ai generated listicles of just you should buy
[4269.38 --> 4273.70]  doing all the same amount of work that you would have to do for something like a video potentially even more
[4273.70 --> 4279.38]  more and making it written there's no written article that is more work than a video form of
[4279.38 --> 4286.82]  the same written article strong disagree i don't agree this will be an interesting conversation yeah
[4287.38 --> 4291.22]  what i'm trying to get at is that sometimes written articles will go deeper
[4293.14 --> 4298.82]  there was actually a long period of time where to go deeper on a subject you would go to the linked
[4298.82 --> 4304.26]  written article okay so i should clarify i did specifically say then a video form of the same
[4304.98 --> 4311.22]  thing if it's the exact same content sure yeah okay then we don't disagree yeah yeah yeah very nice
[4311.22 --> 4319.38]  very good okay um yeah yeah no i i'm just saying that some i i find written articles will go further
[4319.38 --> 4325.38]  into things sure that yeah that's fair yeah so their format differences do sometimes facilitate or do
[4325.38 --> 4330.26]  do sometimes enable a deeper dive sure yeah uh but you're you're never going to make the same amount
[4330.26 --> 4337.70]  of money um that you could with video because on-page ads just are worth like almost nothing yeah and to
[4337.70 --> 4344.10]  make it worth your time you have to like do really anti-consumer very annoying web things like refreshing
[4344.10 --> 4348.18]  the ads as you scroll and like inserting things and having things slide over the writing and all this
[4348.18 --> 4354.02]  crazy stuff which is going to drive people ultimately away from your site or to ad blocking everything so
[4354.02 --> 4358.10]  you're just going to make actually negative money because it costs you money for them to be on your
[4358.10 --> 4364.82]  site and you made nothing off the ads so it's just like well i don't know some sites seem to be
[4364.82 --> 4369.14]  somewhat transitioning to a subscription model i've noticed a lot more paywalls and they wouldn't be
[4369.14 --> 4380.02]  popping up if they weren't working however um i think that there's only really room for a very small number
[4380.02 --> 4387.78]  of sites to succeed with a subscription model the donation model seems to be keeping wikipedia afloat
[4387.78 --> 4393.30]  but i think given the percentage of overall web traffic that is wikipedia you can't just look at
[4393.30 --> 4397.30]  you know what's working for wikipedia and say oh okay well why doesn't somebody else just do that
[4398.02 --> 4402.26]  and i don't know if this is right or not but wikipedia seems to
[4402.26 --> 4410.98]  be just kind of holding on not thriving i mean are they i don't think they report their financials
[4410.98 --> 4416.42]  unless they do i think they talk about like how much run rate they have left and stuff every once
[4416.42 --> 4421.62]  in a while when they ask for funding don't they uh they do report their financials
[4422.58 --> 4429.06]  full year financial statements audited by kpmg wikipedia foundation here we go boys uh it's a lot of
[4429.06 --> 4434.90]  pages it's like 20 pages let me see if i can just find the the bottom line part um
[4436.74 --> 4444.66]  they have 75 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents so i think they're doing okay you
[4444.66 --> 4453.06]  don't know how much it costs um for a website that like basically everyone on the planet uses
[4453.06 --> 4460.66]  i mean it is just text but it's a lot financial it's not just text their financial assets at the
[4460.66 --> 4470.34]  end of 2023 are five million dollars greater than 2022 okay and that number is 196 million dollars
[4471.22 --> 4475.46]  so i see they seem to be doing okay why do they ask for so much all the time then
[4475.46 --> 4480.58]  well on wikipedia they only made five million dollars
[4483.30 --> 4489.46]  but they do seem to have a fair bit of cash is that just profit or is that their revenue um
[4490.02 --> 4495.86]  that's i don't know if you call it revenue this seems to be no this is liquidity and availability of
[4495.86 --> 4500.26]  financial assets so i'm not looking at revenue or profit or anything like that
[4500.26 --> 4508.82]  they spent is this right 69 million dollars on salaries and benefits like am i reading this
[4508.82 --> 4517.54]  wrong help me out guys is that is that what i'm looking at salaries and benefits that is 69 million
[4517.54 --> 4524.42]  dollars right like i'm not i'm not developers do be expensive i mean yeah fair enough awards and grants uh
[4524.42 --> 4531.54]  uh donation processing expenses six million dollars yeah that's what uh that's what a bunch of three
[4531.54 --> 4540.58]  dollar donations will do for you yeah um travel and conferences they spent 800 grand on that i don't
[4540.58 --> 4544.50]  know how many people work there though so it's possible these numbers aren't as outlandish as they
[4544.50 --> 4553.14]  might sound what travel and conferences well i mean travel to conferences right but like 800 grand on that
[4553.14 --> 4559.54]  i wonder how many like how many people yeah i have no idea truthfully for a site that i use as much
[4559.54 --> 4567.38]  as i do and for for a tech you know hold on they have 282 staff members and they're spending 70 million
[4567.38 --> 4573.94]  a year on salaries it sounds like i should get a job at the comedian that's a wrong number in 2016
[4573.94 --> 4580.58]  there was 280 employees in 2020 there was approximately 450 okay so it's going up a fair bit
[4580.58 --> 4583.78]  and that was four years ago
[4587.70 --> 4593.54]  they hold conferences for their community oh okay well that'll cost you yeah we know a thing or two
[4593.54 --> 4597.38]  about that yeah that's real expensive yep i'm surprised it only cost that much
[4600.50 --> 4606.02]  oh man check out handyman he's a good link he always has good links what is this fundraising
[4606.02 --> 4613.94]  statistics oh oh look at that okay so they're trying to stay out ahead of what their their costs
[4613.94 --> 4622.58]  will be black is their net assets green is their revenue red is their expenses so they do they do beat
[4622.58 --> 4627.22]  their expenses but it do be close sometimes pretty close yeah
[4627.22 --> 4635.62]  yeah yeah so you can see they had a really good year in 2021 there's where that profit made its way
[4635.62 --> 4641.22]  into cash and cash equivalents so they're basically like okay we got this war chest and we we're gonna
[4641.22 --> 4646.74]  hold on to that but these years they like they didn't beat it by much no but this black number you
[4646.74 --> 4652.42]  want them to hold on to the war chest if you want wikipedia to stay existing i mean who knows when it's
[4652.42 --> 4660.50]  coming yeah you know when someone tries to go after them um i i i fully support wikimedia sitting
[4660.50 --> 4667.70]  on you know a couple hundred million just in case isn't it like apple's trying to sue epic for 97
[4667.70 --> 4673.78]  million dollars for legal fees or something that right like it's uh apple sues epic i know epic
[4673.78 --> 4681.30]  apple's trying to uh 73 million trying to go hard after that um that medical device company that um
[4681.30 --> 4687.78]  is going after them and has an injunction on like apple apple watch sales or whatever yeah like oh
[4687.78 --> 4693.06]  yeah they've spent a fortune taking it to apple on that and other other smaller companies have come
[4693.06 --> 4699.14]  out and been like thank you you know someone finally having the resources and the stones
[4699.14 --> 4704.42]  to just go toe-to-toe with apple and say hey you actually cannot do this this is not okay to just like
[4705.30 --> 4711.14]  set up an office down the street from someone you poach employees and not care about patents and
[4711.14 --> 4716.98]  ip um and i'm not allegedly allegedly allegedly and i'm not saying even that apple is alleged to
[4716.98 --> 4722.02]  have done that particular thing in this particular case but it's a common strategy that these giant
[4722.02 --> 4728.50]  tech companies do employ so that the people at that company don't even have to move you know they just
[4729.14 --> 4736.50]  go to the office of you know google or apple or facebook or whoever yeah yeah apple had required
[4736.50 --> 4741.38]  the lower courts don't know what that means to order epic games to pay 90 of apple's legal fees
[4741.38 --> 4746.58]  estimated at 73 million dollars and he spent 73 million dollars in legal fees actually not it kind
[4746.58 --> 4755.30]  of makes sense yeah it adds up really fast it turns out yeah not a fan yeah all right dan hit me
[4755.30 --> 4760.98]  haha just kidding he's not there kidding dan you're good uh do we have another topic we want to talk about
[4760.98 --> 4767.38]  oh how about the ad block bug that was blamed you know yeah i was ready to like go to war with youtube
[4767.38 --> 4774.50]  over them throttling the experience for i i basically i sent them an email before i was aware
[4775.06 --> 4781.78]  of the full context for this that was basically like look guys you know as a as a youtube creator
[4782.58 --> 4784.74]  i am as supportive as anyone
[4784.74 --> 4792.82]  when it comes to you know monetizing the platform effectively as long as you guys continue to share
[4792.82 --> 4799.06]  with creators i mean i have some very different thoughts about the ads that they run on non-partner
[4799.06 --> 4807.14]  channels and then just keep 100 of the revenue from because that whole thing doesn't make a ton of
[4807.14 --> 4813.38]  sense to me but when it comes to monetizing the platform and sharing revenue with creators obviously
[4813.38 --> 4822.10]  i have a vested interest in that being successful however as i said as i laid out in my email this is
[4822.10 --> 4827.70]  clearly a step too far you can't interfere with the basic functionality of the platform
[4828.34 --> 4833.38]  for users who happen to have a particular extension installed in their browser like that is not
[4833.38 --> 4838.74]  it's not even just the platform are you talking about the platform as the computing device yeah it was
[4838.74 --> 4845.86]  increasing cpu usage well when loading youtube videos yeah yeah i'm sure in the computer yeah sure
[4845.86 --> 4851.22]  fair enough yeah so either way i was like look i plan to talk about this this week i hope oh sorry
[4851.22 --> 4858.18]  that's why i'm playing footsie yeah i i hope you have a very compelling statement um and then shortly
[4858.18 --> 4866.58]  after that it came out that um well whoops uh whoops last weekend users noticed an extreme
[4866.58 --> 4873.94]  slowdown for youtube videos whenever adblock was enabled oddly even youtube premium users who
[4873.94 --> 4880.74]  happened to have adblock installed were also affected a test by pc gamer found that cpu usage increased
[4880.74 --> 4888.90]  by 17 percent when loading youtube videos with adblock while the slowdown was initially blamed on google
[4888.90 --> 4894.82]  so this is why i sent my original email it turned you did send it i did yes and it turned out that users
[4894.82 --> 4902.34]  of other adblocking services weren't affected and the slowdown was also noticeable when loading videos
[4902.34 --> 4909.62]  on other websites um adblock has since confirmed that this buffering problem was caused by a bug
[4909.62 --> 4919.70]  in its most recent update our discussion questions are twofold one should we be slower to assume malice in
[4919.70 --> 4926.42]  these kinds of cases man i don't know i just don't think i don't think google has earned the benefit of the
[4926.42 --> 4934.50]  doubt lately i mean there was the incognito mode thing there's the general war against adblock and how that's
[4934.50 --> 4941.70]  i do think in general though people jump on things too fast sure i just i i think you're right
[4941.70 --> 4950.02]  i think that is correct and i think that i think the second i think that luke's take is bad here and
[4950.02 --> 4955.62]  we should hate him yeah we should all hate him yeah go after me get them pitchforks yeah i think
[4955.62 --> 4964.02]  sometimes people it's it's the little bit of evil it's a that's their new company motto just just don't
[4964.02 --> 4969.22]  make it too much just do a little bit evil um but yeah i think sometimes it's it's the problem you know
[4969.22 --> 4973.54]  people read a headline without reading the article and then now they're at war and they don't even know
[4973.54 --> 4978.66]  what they're at war about um but they know they're supposed to hate somebody or something and it's
[4978.66 --> 4987.46]  just like oh my goodness um to be clear adblock is fixed now um so they they have since issued a patch
[4987.46 --> 4996.26]  but no the the issue was not in fact youtube however i don't know it wouldn't surprise me if some of
[4996.26 --> 5002.98]  the ongoing develop i'm sure adblock would be happy to you know update their extension once every six months
[5005.46 --> 5012.74]  what i suspect is that they are so frequently updating their extension because of mitigations
[5012.74 --> 5020.10]  that youtube or google is attempting to put in place to prevent the service from working on the site so
[5020.10 --> 5029.06]  is it still google's fault or is google well within their rights to try to prevent the adblock extension
[5029.06 --> 5031.46]  from working on their platform yeah okay
[5035.70 --> 5042.18]  i don't know and like you you can be mad about that you can pitchfork that for sure you can do whatever you
[5042.18 --> 5049.54]  want but let's uh they're still allowed to do that i don't know by the way apparently um i i read the
[5049.54 --> 5055.70]  headline only today so i haven't looked at it yet i this is my first time looking at it apparently they
[5055.70 --> 5061.62]  have updated this and other people who use this device won't see your activity however downloads
[5061.62 --> 5067.54]  bookmarks and reading list uh your activity might still be visible too okay no it still doesn't say
[5067.54 --> 5073.94]  us okay maybe you don't have the yeah maybe it hasn't been rolled out or maybe i don't have the
[5073.94 --> 5081.30]  latest update yeah um it's probably it's probably it's probably a rolling thing but i i heard i heard
[5081.30 --> 5086.50]  that they are updating and full plan shots of the canary warning replaces browse privately with browse
[5086.50 --> 5093.22]  more privately oh hold on oh well well is that what that said let's try it again new incognito window hello
[5093.22 --> 5101.22]  no mine still says now you can browse oh is one of their builds called canary is there google chrome
[5101.22 --> 5106.66]  canary oh that makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's um okay yeah so is that like a
[5106.66 --> 5113.70]  nightly about that yeah yeah okay makes sense see i'm more familiar with the firefox one so
[5116.66 --> 5121.54]  archangel of death points out that firefox got slowed down on youtube a popular fix
[5121.54 --> 5129.22]  was using an agent switcher um that wasn't a bug in an ad blocker yeah fair enough um did we did we
[5129.22 --> 5134.74]  manage to prove that that was malicious i i heard about that one but didn't dig into that this is my
[5134.74 --> 5142.82]  thing it if you prove that it is go after them i'm not saying don't go after i see i'm saying maybe maybe
[5142.82 --> 5150.26]  look for three seconds before before you do so um i don't know i just i think sometimes with with no
[5150.26 --> 5156.34]  actual real knowledge people will dive head first into hatred on something um never experienced that
[5158.34 --> 5163.30]  i don't know what you're talking about and i think i think there is plenty things that deserve the the
[5163.30 --> 5167.06]  full dive of hatred and you should go after them i think you've imagined this whole thing
[5167.62 --> 5174.10]  uh um but i just yeah i don't know i think people should be a little bit more careful what are you even
[5174.10 --> 5184.34]  talking about i don't even know how to respond to this um fujitsu oh wait we should probably do our
[5184.34 --> 5189.54]  sponsors uh dan are we uh is it sponsor time is that what we're supposed to do yeah there's a little
[5189.54 --> 5193.54]  complication with this one so oh should we do the other two first should we wait should we do something

[5362.26 --> 5372.26]  odd pieces wait you must have played puzzle before really who wrote this played puzzle okay doesn't
[5372.26 --> 5378.50]  matter the point is you must have done a puzzle before but our sponsor odd pieces is taking puzzles
[5378.50 --> 5384.58]  to another level odd pieces is a type of puzzle not quite like the ones you may have put together
[5384.58 --> 5394.50]  into your grandmother's den linus to quickly show what's inside the box uh okay this one yeah okay
[5394.50 --> 5406.66]  uh i guess i'll okay yeah sure thanks luke hey there's uh here i'll hold it you can pick things up
[5406.66 --> 5414.98]  there's two puzzle maps okay uh do you want to oh okay oh right so these are what the puzzle is
[5416.18 --> 5421.14]  cute hey look it's an msi lucky dragon okay it's not the msi one but it's definitely a dragon i'm feeling
[5421.14 --> 5430.58]  pretty lucky hello hello open me your adventure starts now warning don't open until after you
[5430.58 --> 5438.02]  complete the puzzle if you open it too soon you might ruin the surprise okay so two storytelling comics
[5439.30 --> 5448.50]  that's cute hello read me discover the world of glitch how it works read the comic build the puzzle
[5448.50 --> 5455.30]  uncover the mystery open the secret envelope oh you get a sticker pack that's cute oh sorry i'm really
[5455.30 --> 5462.34]  not showing this to you guys very well and then you have oh a little find the hidden stories checklist
[5462.34 --> 5468.82]  so it's like a storyline puzzle that's cool very cute then there's also a puzzle that makes sense the
[5468.82 --> 5474.82]  fun part and this kind of fun is subjective is that the pictures on the box don't match up exactly
[5474.82 --> 5484.66]  with the puzzle you're putting together oh oh oh so you build like the next frame oh
[5487.06 --> 5491.14]  so okay help you piece it together keep your brain engaged you'll get the full narrative experience
[5491.14 --> 5496.10]  rather than just finding pieces and putting them together plus odd pieces works with independent
[5496.10 --> 5500.98]  artists who can bring their flair and personality to each puzzle which means if you want to gift a
[5500.98 --> 5505.54]  puzzle to someone you can match their personality and a part of every sale goes back into finding more

[5514.10 --> 5523.38]  all right merch messages how many dan all right hit me hi dll as someone who primarily works online
[5523.38 --> 5527.46]  how do you feel about the impact of screen time and social media on mental health
[5527.46 --> 5533.22]  oh it's huge and extremely negative social media is terrible for me it's really really bad for
[5533.22 --> 5538.50]  everyone i'm just really glad i don't have it on my phone anymore yeah occasionally i'll still like
[5538.50 --> 5545.78]  doom scroll on twitter or facebook or whatever else but now that it's not on my phone it's so much so much
[5545.78 --> 5549.94]  better going and touching grass is unironically an extremely good idea and you should do it
[5549.94 --> 5558.18]  it sounds fake but okay it's not we man we need to do a chia pet we talked about this on our previous
[5558.18 --> 5562.82]  when show we need to do the touch grass genuinely think it would be cool just like a little square
[5563.62 --> 5569.46]  you can have on your desk yeah that would actually be great so you can touch it yeah yeah yeah yeah
[5570.10 --> 5574.26]  we could make it like kind of like you know techie like it could have orbeez in it so you only have
[5574.26 --> 5579.30]  to water it like once in a while you know it's a water retention and release just like you know
[5579.30 --> 5586.18]  like it's like super low gamer grass gamer grass yeah that really does that probably already exists
[5586.18 --> 5599.30]  and it's probably a really different product oh man yeah i was wondering what linus's favorite or top
[5599.30 --> 5604.98]  motorcycling tech gadgets or mods are besides the backpack i've been looking for cool things to
[5604.98 --> 5612.74]  bring along with me while i'm out riding during the summer i am the basicest um i uh my bike barely
[5612.74 --> 5624.42]  even has a digital speedometer on it it's a 2003 um i i do have an old pebble a pebble time that i that i
[5624.42 --> 5631.54]  hot glued a magnet onto the back of and then i have a magnet that i um that i also hot glued onto
[5631.54 --> 5638.42]  my motorbike so i can put it on there and then i have tactile buttons for changing uh changing media
[5638.42 --> 5643.38]  tracks and then i have speakers embedded in my headphones with just like a wire coming out and
[5643.38 --> 5650.98]  then i use my old note 9 or at least i used to i mangled my headphone jack oh yeah i mean i'm sure i can
[5650.98 --> 5657.54]  like fix it or whatever but that would suck that phone has taken a serious beating yeah i like man
[5657.54 --> 5664.02]  like three weeks ago after i switched back to it after oh no in between fair phone and wing i switched
[5664.02 --> 5668.74]  back to it temporarily and i was like man i haven't listened to real headphones in a while i grabbed my
[5668.74 --> 5675.30]  ie 600s that i still keep in my backpack just in case plug them in was like i forgot what headphones
[5675.30 --> 5680.10]  are supposed to sound like right right air pods pro they're good for wireless crappy headphones but
[5680.10 --> 5688.10]  they they sound like right um immediately like got it snagged on something because i'm just not used
[5688.10 --> 5694.50]  to it anymore like yeah one one side works and it's it's not the headphones it's the it's the jack anyway
[5695.14 --> 5698.90]  where was i going with this right the point is um i'm gonna have to find i'm gonna have to grab
[5698.90 --> 5702.90]  another old phone or a new phone that has a headphone jack or something and then that goes in my in my
[5702.90 --> 5709.14]  pocket and i just run it up through my thing i got my speakers not in-ears speakers and that's it that's
[5709.14 --> 5715.06]  that's all my motorcycle tech just so i can get my turn by turn and my music and so that i can change
[5715.06 --> 5723.70]  tracks and adjust volume so uh gamer grass or oh no gamers grass um i don't know this is not an
[5723.70 --> 5730.10]  endorsement i don't know anything about this company um we sort of love hugged their website without me
[5730.10 --> 5736.02]  even talking about it um it also it almost like completely stopped functioning but it seems to be
[5736.02 --> 5741.22]  working for you now this actually looks super cool so if you're into like miniatures and stuff
[5741.22 --> 5746.18]  that kind of gaming yeah yeah if you're into miniatures and stuff or or i could i could absolutely
[5746.18 --> 5754.34]  see dnd groups even two millimeter tufts oh two millimeters tall yeah that makes way more sense i
[5754.34 --> 5759.30]  thought it was two millimeters square and i'm supposed to like assemble that you can also get bases so
[5759.30 --> 5764.34]  you're you're currently shopping for tufts so if you if you clicked on bases i'm a tough enthusiast you
[5764.34 --> 5766.98]  can don't shave that tuft
[5774.34 --> 5781.06]  oh my goodness uh anyways i think this is actually super cool so no he probably can't call it gamers grass
[5781.06 --> 5789.22]  um but yeah apparently there's other brands and stuff yeah sure i don't know what's a laser plant
[5790.42 --> 5796.58]  a laser plant oh man there's like uh their site's real slow oh yeah yeah we've got a lot of people
[5796.58 --> 5801.62]  on here right now i think all right cool it is not loading but yeah apparently that's already a thing
[5801.62 --> 5807.46]  all right i'm sure ploof knows about it probably yeah no he's gotten super into miniatures what dan
[5807.46 --> 5814.74]  it's good for 40k as well yeah yeah you have miniatures in 40k yeah what do you think i was
[5814.74 --> 5819.86]  talking about yeah dan yeah dan what the heck dan dan why are you not even in the center of your camera
[5819.86 --> 5827.14]  dan oh boy
[5835.14 --> 5842.10]  all right all right hit me dan uh sure not physically you're too far away i'm not feeling it tonight
[5842.10 --> 5848.82]  hey come over here and i'll beat you uh hey have you seen that a couple of small companies are making a
[5848.82 --> 5855.70]  500 watt atx gan i think that i can't remember what that stands for some sort of nitride bsu gallium
[5855.70 --> 5861.54]  nitride yeah when do you think we will see a again psu in mainstream uh do-it-yourself builds
[5862.42 --> 5870.82]  uh hold on 500 watt gan power supply why well for for idx builds
[5870.82 --> 5877.70]  uh what light and float play chat said get off the gamer grass website mom said it's my turn to look
[5882.42 --> 5887.94]  hd plex these guys are awesome their products are super cool it makes a ton of sense that they
[5887.94 --> 5895.86]  would be using gan um gan basically allows you to shrink um your power supply and it's super
[5895.86 --> 5901.14]  efficiency it's oh my god what am i talking about it makes it so you can build smaller more efficient
[5901.14 --> 5908.42]  power supplies thank you um i i have not personally looked into the electronics engineering reasons that
[5908.42 --> 5915.62]  that's possible but i do know that it's a um super cool tech and allows you to make super compact um
[5915.62 --> 5921.70]  very efficient power supplies so yeah this is a tiny 500 watt power supply look how small this is that's
[5921.70 --> 5929.30]  ridiculous um what it's not an ac power supply this is a dc to a to dc power supply is my
[5929.30 --> 5934.10]  understand oh wait no way is this an ac power supply yeah shut up uh-huh
[5937.62 --> 5944.50]  that's pretty wild wow there's more connectors plug if you keep scrolling there should be some yeah
[5944.50 --> 5951.14]  there you go no way shut up there you go that is bananas okay that's super cool um yeah hd plex
[5951.14 --> 5956.02]  super cool company they make super cool really compact silent sometimes power supplies they've
[5956.02 --> 5960.50]  they've done some dc to dc designs in the past which is what led me to believe that this was a dc to dc
[5960.50 --> 5968.26]  no this is a 500 watt ac to dc power supply that is bananas uh anywho the point is that i don't think
[5968.26 --> 5973.62]  we're going to see gan in a full-sized atx power supply anytime soon because they can already build
[5973.62 --> 5978.66]  a full-sized atx power supply that can do 1600 watts in north america which is the maximum that we can draw
[5978.66 --> 5985.38]  off of a single circuit and they can already do a full-sized atx power supply that had that that'll
[5985.38 --> 5989.86]  do 2 000 watts on 240 volt which is the maximum no that's actually not the maximum you can do in europe
[5989.86 --> 5994.58]  but it's the maximum that you could reasonably build a computer with um anytime in the near future
[5995.22 --> 5999.54]  never is a strong word as the prices come down you know maybe it'll actually be more efficient and
[5999.54 --> 6003.78]  more cost effective to build a gan power supply but for now it's a premium technology and not something
[6003.78 --> 6008.34]  that we're going to see anytime soon just because we don't really need it stop trying to make bananas
[6008.34 --> 6018.02]  happen i will not i will not stop dan hit me sure any updates on the laptop or shoulder back would
[6018.02 --> 6022.82]  really like it for school as the backpack which is awesome it is a little bulky for my load
[6022.82 --> 6026.90]  let me check
[6029.62 --> 6029.86]  uh
[6032.74 --> 6038.10]  this gamers christ stuff is really cool it took me about seven minutes to load the laser plants have
[6038.10 --> 6045.54]  you ever seen a static flocking machine where you you put it in this charged chamber and it charges the
[6045.54 --> 6052.42]  base and you put your glue on it and then you basically like explode uh like the grass flock and then
[6052.42 --> 6057.78]  it all sticks in and points in one direction so it actually looks like grass instead of just like
[6057.78 --> 6067.38]  dabbing it on it it's like powder coating but for fake grass but for fake grass wow no i have not that's
[6067.38 --> 6069.94]  cool i just googled it
[6072.58 --> 6076.66]  it looks like something else i used to uh i used to do 40k
[6076.66 --> 6078.82]  expensive hobby
[6078.82 --> 6083.38]  unbelievably unless you go to england it was i bought some stuff when i was in england and it
[6083.38 --> 6087.86]  was like wow this is extremely affordable it's almost cheaper to fly to england buy your models and
[6087.86 --> 6094.82]  then fly back why is it so much cheaper because they're made in england they're made there i believe so
[6096.98 --> 6102.82]  at least they used to be oh wow i don't have an update on the notebook bag but i do have an update on
[6102.82 --> 6107.06]  carabiner replacements i was going to ask that too we're going to have 500 kits sent out within
[6107.06 --> 6113.06]  the next couple of weeks oh let's go we're doing it we have more um no i'm just happy things are
[6113.06 --> 6118.26]  starting yeah the first order is going to have more but the reason we're doing 500 first is to
[6118.26 --> 6126.18]  make sure yeah so it's a rolling thing cool um we got an update on some ykk polls those were pending for
[6126.18 --> 6131.62]  a couple weeks yeah so stuff stuff's happening um magnetic cable management is pending a launch
[6131.62 --> 6138.66]  late this month apparently um we have some packs also very cool feeling good for go live uh there's
[6138.66 --> 6145.94]  no update in my in my cw update for the jan 7th week which is the most recent one that i think i have
[6146.58 --> 6150.66]  for notebook bag and i'll check the previous one that i also hadn't read yet
[6150.66 --> 6156.42]  no i don't see anything about it in there either so hopefully i'll get an update on that fairly soon
[6156.42 --> 6163.78]  and then i can um get you guys up to speed uh as you might imagine our relationship with our backpack
[6163.78 --> 6169.86]  who is also our notebook bag supplier has been a little bit more complicated lately with the whole
[6169.86 --> 6177.54]  double layer thing so you sure want to make it i hope the order's in i'm actually not sure though i'm
[6177.54 --> 6183.54]  sorry um did you mention the magnetic cable management i can't remember i did okay good
[6184.58 --> 6189.54]  hopefully launching this month so if you were looking for if you are one of the people who
[6189.54 --> 6194.18]  got a 25 credit for your backpack and you're looking for something to uh try out
[6197.14 --> 6204.58]  that's gonna be a big one show you guys dan how your fingers feeling damn ready nice uh all right
[6204.58 --> 6207.06]  what are we supposed to do topics you got it
[6209.62 --> 6217.78]  fujitsu agrees that it is morally culpable don't know exactly what that means how does that translate
[6217.78 --> 6225.78]  to dollars i guess um that remains yeah we'll see morally culpable in 700 plus wrongful convictions
[6226.42 --> 6232.50]  paul patterson european head of fujitsu has publicly acknowledged that the company has a moral
[6232.50 --> 6239.14]  obligation to help financially compensate hundreds of uk postal workers who were wrongfully charged
[6239.14 --> 6246.58]  and convicted of theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015 fujitsu supported the post office in the
[6246.58 --> 6254.82]  prosecution of hundreds of innocent sub postmasters based on discrepancies found in fujitsu's horizon
[6254.82 --> 6259.06]  accounting soft i didn't even know fujitsu made accounting they're one of those companies that just make
[6259.06 --> 6265.46]  all the things the company now admits that they knew the software was flawed even at the time
[6266.02 --> 6274.42]  and they took part in an appalling miscarriage of justice however patterson says that fujitsu will wait
[6274.42 --> 6282.18]  for a judge to determine the company's share of the settlement okay you know would i be trying to
[6282.18 --> 6289.06]  come up with something hoping that if it was like in good faith decent that maybe i would get better
[6290.82 --> 6294.82]  like maybe i'd be looked at more favorably in a situation like this or would i just be like
[6295.78 --> 6303.22]  but i'll just i'ma let you i'ma wait and see like i what what would be the play what would be your play
[6303.22 --> 6307.06]  i mean obviously we're not lawyers we don't know the right way to do this but we can kind of
[6307.06 --> 6311.54]  this is we're talking we're talking to do something moral culpability i think you'd have to try to do
[6311.54 --> 6317.46]  something i think i would i'd i'd want to try to do something yeah even if it's small even if it's
[6317.46 --> 6325.78]  just like you know hey how about like uh like um i don't know groceries stipend from now until this is
[6325.78 --> 6330.74]  all resolved and with the with the understanding that it'll come out of the total payout or something
[6330.74 --> 6334.34]  you know like just make their lives a little easier for a bit or something like i don't know i have
[6334.34 --> 6340.18]  no idea what exactly but i'll try to do something luke i'm spitballing you know obviously not like
[6340.18 --> 6344.98]  you know a tim hortons gift card but something something meaningful that makes their makes their
[6344.98 --> 6351.06]  lives a little better for a bit instead of way worse for a long period of time but you cost 700
[6351.06 --> 6358.58]  plus people their jobs so what about like wage subsidy people went to jail this is bad at least wage subsidy
[6358.58 --> 6364.82]  um the sub postmasters who are self-employed contractors started reporting errors in the
[6364.82 --> 6370.82]  horizon software only a few weeks after it had been installed the post office responded by denying
[6370.82 --> 6375.46]  there was any flaw in the system and forcing individual workers to pay out of pocket to make
[6375.46 --> 6381.54]  up the difference there's never been any bugs in flow plane the post you're wrong the post office
[6381.54 --> 6388.10]  privately investigated over 900 contractors then used horizon as evidence against them in criminal court
[6388.10 --> 6397.30]  leading to imprisonment bankruptcy and four suicides even after a 2012 independent forensic audit found
[6397.30 --> 6402.66]  that horizon had serious flaws that could explain these discrepancies the post office stood by the
[6402.66 --> 6408.90]  software's reliability in 2019 the post office lost a class action lawsuit brought by over 500 sub
[6408.90 --> 6415.30]  postmasters leading to public inquiry or leading to a public inquiry the bbc recently aired a dramatization
[6415.30 --> 6420.74]  of the affair which has drawn public outcry again in response last week the british prime minister
[6420.74 --> 6425.22]  announced legislation to exonerate the affected sub postmasters i'm wondering why this took so long
[6426.10 --> 6433.46]  yeah like that's just criminal i mean there's no word for it other than criminal um
[6433.46 --> 6446.34]  yeah i haven't watched the bbc program on this but uh people are adding additional details in the chat
[6446.34 --> 6453.78]  apparently it's amazing um people are adding details in the chat that are just appalling like like this is
[6453.78 --> 6460.58]  f***ed up man yeah this this is this is this is like so one thing that i'm i'm getting a little bit lost
[6460.58 --> 6466.58]  last year though yeah was it the post office that said there was no bugs or was it fujitsu um the
[6466.58 --> 6473.70]  post office said there was no bugs but we don't i don't think we know um what fujitsu's role is because
[6473.70 --> 6483.22]  we haven't watched the thing yet right but like yeah i mean is that is that not at the very least manslaughter
[6483.22 --> 6491.86]  like for the people responsible for like can technically i yeah i don't think you can be
[6491.86 --> 6495.86]  charged for someone else's no you can be charged for someone else's suicide if you
[6495.86 --> 6501.14]  yeah bully or goad them into it yeah i don't know if this is going to get into legal stuff that we
[6501.14 --> 6506.66]  don't understand in a country that we're not in yeah but like it's going to be wild whoa yeah absolutely
[6506.66 --> 6519.22]  anyway um so uh i am not a financial advisor but maybe don't invest in fujitsu
[6522.82 --> 6524.82]  if you've been watching the whole show that'll make sense
[6524.82 --> 6529.38]  oh
[6531.70 --> 6532.98]  wild what's up
[6535.14 --> 6539.38]  i guess it's a small amount but like i i would assumed would have assumed this would
[6539.38 --> 6546.26]  have done something huh lunch break nice well this is the one day no i just mean this is this
[6546.26 --> 6551.06]  is this like the uh the japanese stock market or something bringing back over the last one day
[6551.06 --> 6553.86]  i mean that can that's that's a thing though
[6554.82 --> 6561.70]  because people buy the dip right yeah anywho um but this is like
[6562.82 --> 6565.62]  i wonder when this news broke because they've been going down since
[6568.26 --> 6571.30]  what happened here stocks are weird
[6574.02 --> 6580.10]  anyways that's horrible people are like yeah this won't matter to uh their stock because they're like
[6580.10 --> 6583.38]  as big as general electric speaking of general yeah they make like everything
[6583.38 --> 6590.98]  general electric appliances threatens legal action against open source dev and of course this was
[6590.98 --> 6595.78]  going to end up on the wan show appliance manufacturer higher who owns both general electric
[6595.78 --> 6604.34]  appliances and hoover has issued a takedown order against andre bosch i'm so sorry i butchered your name i'm sure
[6604.34 --> 6610.10]  a developer who maintains the open source home assistant integration plugins for hires
[6610.98 --> 6616.34]  h on hon i don't know whatever this is their smart control app i think it's like home on but shortened
[6616.34 --> 6623.94]  according to hires notice the plugins use their services in an unauthorized manner which is causing
[6623.94 --> 6629.62]  significant economic harm to their company what the are you talking about higher what what
[6629.62 --> 6637.22]  economic economic devices people buy your product i wouldn't even begin to consider an appliance
[6637.70 --> 6644.90]  wait do they have a service i wouldn't even begin to consider buying your appliance if it didn't have
[6644.90 --> 6652.50]  a plug-in for home assistant and if i wasn't a home assistant user then i would have no idea what home
[6652.50 --> 6661.22]  assistant is so what the are you talking about okay i'm ready to listen oh i i need to look into this
[6661.22 --> 6667.22]  more but uh mario p in full plane chat said the post office said there was no bugs fujitsu staff
[6667.22 --> 6672.50]  witness statements were edited by the post office to remove references to there being yeah we don't know
[6672.50 --> 6678.34]  enough about that but we need to look more into it anyway higher this right now um i'm wondering if there
[6678.34 --> 6683.22]  is a software solution that general electric has that they're trying to sell that people are using
[6684.02 --> 6689.54]  um home assistant for instead i wonder if that's what they're saying because i agree you're buying
[6689.54 --> 6695.46]  the appliance thing whatever i suspect people are buying this because it works with home assistant
[6695.46 --> 6700.34]  more than anything else um probably not the home assistant community is pretty small is it oh yeah
[6700.34 --> 6705.86]  it's just my circles i guess yeah yeah it seems like a big idea everyone i talk to about home automation
[6705.86 --> 6710.66]  just talks about home assistant so either way
[6712.74 --> 6725.94]  either way this is this is crap um i don't want a billion different stupid apps with a billion
[6725.94 --> 6732.58]  different subscription services so higher tweeted out saying the higher brand in the us is independent
[6732.58 --> 6739.78]  of higher europe and operates separately hon or h on or whatever is the connected iot platform for
[6739.78 --> 6746.66]  higher europe in the us customers can use our open iot platform smart hq smart hq does not prevent
[6746.66 --> 6752.10]  integrations with home assistant okay so shout out higher us yeah for doing things
[6753.30 --> 6759.54]  right at least and for saying this publicly today yeah and for coming out and condemning their their
[6759.54 --> 6765.62]  cousin company over in europe um it's time for their cousin company over in europe to uh
[6767.06 --> 6774.50]  figure this out because this is not cool this is not how it works um oh i am gimley says higher us
[6774.50 --> 6779.14]  actually has an api that anyone can use to interact with their gear that's super cool
[6779.14 --> 6788.18]  cody 4k says go go european commission yeah really yeah i mean hey we've talked about it a fair bit like
[6788.18 --> 6796.26]  the eu being pretty cool and stuff this is something that needs to happen yeah we cannot allow appliance
[6796.26 --> 6802.18]  companies like you're you're stuck with this for like 20 years right like these are not this is not even
[6802.18 --> 6806.90]  a phone where it's like optimistically you're going to use it for five i think samsung just committed to
[6806.90 --> 6812.02]  seven years with the galaxy s24 that's kind of a big deal that is cool i totally forgot to that is
[6812.02 --> 6815.94]  cool talk about that this week but um you know optimistically you're going to use this phone for
[6815.94 --> 6822.50]  you know seven years or whatever we're talking stuff that you are maybe going to use for 20 30 years
[6822.50 --> 6829.46]  like no you don't get to just sell me something with the with the understanding that i can you know
[6829.46 --> 6834.18]  access it through this plugin or whatever and then just go ah ha ha no forget it now you need to pay
[6834.18 --> 6842.02]  our subscription fee for for like the the the the lifespan of i don't know what kind of animal
[6842.02 --> 6847.54]  lives a horse how long do horses live i think they live about that long
[6850.82 --> 6855.70]  25 to 30 years nailed it okay anywho
[6855.70 --> 6864.18]  uh it is unclear at this time whether the plugins actually contain any proprietary code but
[6864.18 --> 6868.34]  bash has announced that he will be pulling the plugins in the next few days due to fear of legal
[6868.34 --> 6875.30]  reprisal yeah under certain circumstances i would i would love to be like yeah i'm going to get together
[6875.30 --> 6878.58]  a coalition of creators and we're going to like fund your defense or whatever but like
[6878.58 --> 6886.02]  um this is general electric we just talked on the show about how you know lawsuits can run like i i
[6886.02 --> 6891.46]  actually don't have the money apple trying to sue for 73 million like if they if they decide to like go
[6891.46 --> 6898.10]  ham at this um and and it sucks that the best advice i can give is that yeah you probably should just pull
[6898.10 --> 6905.54]  the plug in i i think you should pull the plug in and immediately uh send i don't know how you do this
[6905.54 --> 6910.26]  contact some form of representative in the european commission and try to get some stuff moving they
[6910.26 --> 6914.50]  seem to be aggressive about this stuff this might legitimately be something that they want to jump on
[6914.50 --> 6920.18]  and it might not be this specifically they might not have to go after like general electric specifically
[6920.18 --> 6924.98]  but they might solve this problem for the industry as a whole which is way better anyways and then you
[6924.98 --> 6930.58]  can release your plug-in back again i think that's the way to go not that they're watching or care but yeah
[6930.58 --> 6937.38]  um open ai made two notable changes to their terms of service this week yeah first ones the company
[6937.38 --> 6942.90]  announced that they're adding new rules prohibiting the use of their llm tools to create political
[6942.90 --> 6948.34]  misinformation or to impersonate a political candidate or official cool that's going to help a lot because
[6948.34 --> 6953.06]  it's not like there are any other similar tools that could be used to do these things zero i mean in all
[6953.06 --> 6958.02]  seriousness though we should be supportive this is good yeah it is a good thing what's less good is that
[6958.02 --> 6966.34]  open ai quietly dropped language banning the military use of their tools what a company owned by microsoft
[6966.34 --> 6975.22]  huh what do you mean what do you mean what do you mean yeah all right cool so um according to
[6975.22 --> 6980.82]  leaked internal documents one thing i'll say oh sure is if you didn't think other countries are doing this
[6980.82 --> 6987.30]  you're nuts according to leaked internal documents amazon is preparing to launch a paid subscription for an
[6987.30 --> 6993.22]  upgraded version of alexa later this year tentatively named alexa plus can you imagine yourself paying
[6993.22 --> 7004.42]  for alexa no i don't have any alexa enabled devices at all so definitely not the new alexa has llm chatbot
[7004.42 --> 7011.30]  like features i mean it'll cost a lot for them to run so there's that intended to improve its reasoning
[7011.30 --> 7015.78]  and conversational abilities including the ability to distinguish between when a user finishes talking
[7015.78 --> 7023.38]  versus when they briefly pause wow progress however it's apparently prone to rambling factual errors
[7023.38 --> 7029.54]  and hallucination the documents also reveal a degree of internal conflict within amazon because
[7029.54 --> 7034.82]  some employees felt the company shouldn't charge for the new features how are they gonna pay for it
[7034.82 --> 7041.54]  yeah that's that sounds like people who really cool idea would rather be laid off than deal with having
[7041.54 --> 7049.78]  a balance sheet that is positive yeah like i just i i love ideas but that's ultimately you want to raise
[7049.78 --> 7056.02]  at the end of the year and everybody needs to eat so if there's some massive new expense someone has to
[7056.02 --> 7061.86]  pay for it yeah is it going to be you with your salary or is it going to be the customer yeah i don't know
[7061.86 --> 7068.26]  bezos isn't going to take less kind of silly um oh right sorry i keep saying alexa sorry sorry guys i
[7068.26 --> 7076.90]  forgot um maybe soon you'll have a alexa play despacito oh stop luke you're gonna make the two people
[7076.90 --> 7087.46]  that use alexa upset what a f***ing i hope i got somebody you probably got both of them you almost
[7087.46 --> 7092.50]  certainly did you got me yes
[7099.14 --> 7101.06]  oh man oh that was worth it
[7104.66 --> 7106.74]  it's an older meme but it checks out
[7110.02 --> 7117.30]  that was the song everyone used to do right yes yeah i thought so um the vision pro has apparently
[7117.30 --> 7122.90]  no hot apps pre-orders have started as of yesterday we've got our order in i think its
[7122.90 --> 7126.90]  delivery is scheduled for late march or april or something like that so that either means they're
[7126.90 --> 7131.70]  getting a lot of orders or it means they're not producing a lot of them uh demand is reportedly high
[7131.70 --> 7137.62]  enough that it has exceeded available stock in several u.s cities strangely attempting to pre-order
[7137.62 --> 7144.10]  online seems to require an iphone or an ipad with face id really huh you know it doesn't surprise me that
[7144.10 --> 7148.98]  much i have a whole thing that i want to do on how impossible it is to uh cancel apple arcade from
[7148.98 --> 7157.46]  an apple tv if i didn't don't own an ipad or an iphone the only way to cancel a subscribe you cannot
[7157.46 --> 7162.90]  do it on the apple tv there is no button it should be it should be illegal it's got to be illegal already
[7162.90 --> 7171.78]  you cannot that like has to be illegal uh also this is a fun one um i could not find any way to remove
[7172.74 --> 7178.74]  my payment information they scan your face for the cushion people are saying because i am the family
[7178.74 --> 7186.02]  plan owner so as a family plan owner i must have a valid credit card unless it like expires
[7186.90 --> 7191.86]  i actually do not see how that could possibly be legal either they might be able to update your
[7191.86 --> 7196.42]  credit card if you get a new one if it expires as well google can do that i'm pretty sure apple can
[7196.42 --> 7202.26]  do that no i just mean i couldn't remove it no what i'm saying is even if the card expires if you
[7202.26 --> 7206.58]  get issued a new one they might be able to get that number from your bank google can do that really
[7206.58 --> 7212.98]  yeah like uh google pay i'm fairly certain apple pay can do this as well okay well apple didn't when
[7212.98 --> 7218.50]  my uh card lapsed before so do you have apple pay like tap with your phone and pay no okay yeah i'm
[7218.50 --> 7223.70]  pretty sure that system can yeah no just my apple arcade subscription lapsed because my card expired
[7223.70 --> 7227.70]  and it did not automatically apple has done that for me yeah so apple pay and google pay will both
[7227.70 --> 7233.22]  update your card be with information from your bank but like they'll have your new cards information in
[7233.22 --> 7236.98]  your phone before you even receive your new card in the mail that's like use privacy one of your
[7236.98 --> 7242.02]  previous sponsors i want to it's not in canada it's not in canada i really wish it was yeah me too it's
[7242.02 --> 7245.94]  a super cool service very cool i will show for privacy anytime they're not even like have they even
[7245.94 --> 7250.66]  sponsored in a while not in a while yeah it's still super cool yeah i just wish they were in canada
[7250.66 --> 7256.66]  anyway yeah so i want to do a whole thing on it where i like live i go through and i show you guys
[7256.66 --> 7262.66]  a how hard it was to subscribe to it in the first place just on my android phone through a browser
[7262.66 --> 7269.30]  it was like almost impossible and then unsubscribing was literally impossible it could not be done on the
[7269.30 --> 7274.90]  apple tv could not be done on my phone in a browser could not be done on my computer in a browser i had to
[7274.90 --> 7281.46]  download the desktop itunes application if for whatever reason i did not own a desktop pc if my
[7281.46 --> 7288.26]  only computing device was an apple tv it would be completely impossible to cancel my subscription or
[7288.26 --> 7294.90]  because i'm a family manager remove my credit card because i was like okay screw it i'll just remove my
[7294.90 --> 7299.38]  credit card i don't need to buy anything else from apple and it wouldn't allow me to do it you actually
[7299.38 --> 7306.82]  cannot keep my credit card information against my will that cannot possibly be legal anywho the reason
[7307.46 --> 7312.58]  for them requiring an iphone or an ipad with face id is that they scan your face to make sure the
[7312.58 --> 7317.94]  cushion fits better apparently despite apple's claim that most ipad apps can play on the vision pro
[7317.94 --> 7326.50]  without any changes it seems the device won't have access to most top apps from the app store at launch
[7326.50 --> 7337.14]  including and this is uh these are some heavy hitters amazon netflix youtube instagram facebook and
[7337.14 --> 7345.62]  tick tock according to mac stories none of the top 46 apps on the app store will be available as a native
[7345.62 --> 7352.10]  app and just above a third of them will be available in compatibility mode meaning that nearly two thirds of
[7352.10 --> 7360.10]  developers explicitly opted out of making their ipad app compatible with the headset youtube confirmed
[7360.10 --> 7365.06]  that it was not allowing its app to be used in compatibility mode did not clarify why and instead
[7365.06 --> 7372.02]  suggested that vision pro users should access the site through a browser so discussion question for you
[7372.90 --> 7379.22]  what is the most likely reason that so many companies would actively avoid allowing their apps to be used
[7379.22 --> 7387.06]  on a hot new prestige product i honestly don't know like would you allow float plane in compatibility
[7387.06 --> 7391.22]  mode if people are like yeah i want to try it or would you be worried about a whole bunch of support
[7391.22 --> 7398.02]  calls if it doesn't work right yeah we are a statistically extremely small team for what we do though
[7398.02 --> 7405.62]  um i feel like a a team like netflix would be able to handle that what if they just didn't give a
[7405.62 --> 7415.54]  about the 63 people that are going to be watching netflix that's possible yeah maybe the um i i'm
[7415.54 --> 7420.42]  surprised they wouldn't try to buddy with apple more and just do it to make apple happy uh i don't think
[7420.42 --> 7425.22]  anything makes apple happy other than money i don't i don't i'm not convinced that that's like really a
[7425.22 --> 7430.50]  thing okay i i don't know have you seen any evidence of it no i have no idea it seems like their their
[7430.50 --> 7435.06]  relationship with app developers is pretty adversarial for the most part i just i find
[7435.06 --> 7439.46]  that like a lot of these companies will have apps for like everything you could imagine because they
[7439.46 --> 7443.86]  just have like these monstrous dev teams and they're just like yeah we're going to support every freaking
[7443.86 --> 7448.90]  tv and every way and all this other type of stuff i don't know maybe we should try it when we get ours
[7449.70 --> 7455.22]  try what float plane app oh wait we don't have an ipad app don't forget it yeah there you go all right
[7455.22 --> 7463.22]  see you later maybe we could maybe get oh he's like far away now and stuff but there you know i'm
[7463.22 --> 7468.90]  not even going to talk about it because i i learned my lesson of of telling people what we're working on
[7468.90 --> 7474.74]  for float plane because then they want it like tomorrow oh what is it i don't know i don't even think you
[7474.74 --> 7479.30]  know no you have to tell me nope i'll call your boss i'm not even on shift
[7479.30 --> 7486.66]  i've been working for 12 hours today come at me bro
[7492.18 --> 7492.58]  all right
[7496.10 --> 7502.10]  google more layoffs um google has laid off over a thousand staff across their business in the last
[7502.10 --> 7507.78]  nine days i made sure our youtube rep was okay hey shout out glad you're good um nice according to an
[7507.78 --> 7513.30]  internal memo from ceo center pichai these layoffs will not be as severe oh there's more coming they
[7513.30 --> 7524.26]  say oh wow okay um yeah there's more a lot that sucks uh in other news amd's phoenix one and phoenix
[7524.26 --> 7531.78]  two apus are not twin cores this is a this is a cute headline from uh presumably jessica for some time
[7531.78 --> 7538.26]  we've known that amd would be using two different chips in its ryzen 8000 g apus phoenix one and phoenix
[7538.26 --> 7545.78]  two cool names with the biggest difference we were aware of being that phoenix two uses some zen4c cores
[7545.78 --> 7553.06]  so these are these compact ones that um on the server side of things anyway allow greater core density
[7553.06 --> 7558.34]  at the expense of higher clock speeds um and i believe they also have less cash but i'm not sure if
[7558.34 --> 7563.86]  that's anything to do with the cores themselves or if it's um the the uh the bigger caches uh so
[7563.86 --> 7571.22]  don't quote me on that but full specs posted by gigabyte show that phoenix 2 apus not only use n4c
[7571.22 --> 7580.74]  cores but they have fewer pcie lanes which will cap them to two pcie gen 4 lanes for the secondary nvme slot
[7580.74 --> 7590.50]  further while phoenix one has eight pcie 4.0 lanes for add-in gpus phoenix 2 has only four currently the
[7590.50 --> 7600.10]  ryzen 5 8500g is the only retail design using phoenix 2 and i will be very interested to see if amd even
[7600.10 --> 7605.14]  seeds these phoenix 2 chips to reviewers or if they are going to pull a quiet
[7605.14 --> 7612.42]  hmm well here's the skews you should review and these ones will also be like on new egg and maybe
[7612.42 --> 7615.70]  people will just like buy those ones because they're less expensive and they'll assume it's that
[7615.70 --> 7625.22]  but cheaper i am i'm not liking this um that few pcie lanes could be a major disadvantage for this chip
[7626.10 --> 7633.78]  especially as it ages yeah four lanes for a gpu do you find it's misleading that the two is worse
[7635.14 --> 7639.54]  um it's a code name so i don't worry about that as much got it okay but the fact that they're all
[7639.54 --> 7647.06]  8000g just with like one number different to me indicates that they are feature similar and i am
[7647.06 --> 7653.78]  not pleased with this yeah i think that's it for topics this week dan i think it's time for after dark
[7654.98 --> 7658.18]  isn't it i thought there was something you're supposed to talk about that wasn't in the
[7658.18 --> 7661.94]  list oh radion challenge update that can be that can be after dark okay
[7665.14 --> 7671.46]  oh oh after dark is brought to you by dbrand again because the sales team apparently um
[7672.82 --> 7677.22]  has found that only dbrand is interested in sponsoring after dark hey dbrand if you're
[7677.22 --> 7683.54]  watching this which i know you almost certainly are oh uh oh wow got him um dbrand if you're watching
[7683.54 --> 7689.06]  this uh you can probably negotiate with the uh biz team because i don't think they have any other
[7689.06 --> 7695.94]  offers for when show after dark so what but what are you doing why am i helping them yeah uh well
[7695.94 --> 7701.38]  i've just in good faith i'm offering them it's more why are you why are you nerfing the business
[7701.38 --> 7707.06]  no i'm offering them i'm offering them good advice yeah but they've got targets so that so that dbrand
[7707.06 --> 7714.18]  will feel indebted to us and offer to pay more oh it's it's 4d chess i don't think it's gonna work
[7714.18 --> 7717.78]  yeah it's like next level emotional manipulation i think you just sacked your queen
[7721.86 --> 7726.02]  you just lost your queen in the fourth dimension now it's time for the wan show after dark

[7771.14 --> 7778.10]  working on it so it's just a cute little it looks great it's a cute little um that's so cool it's a
[7778.10 --> 7783.78]  cute little bread themed dinosaur standing oh yeah i don't know you guys can't really see it but there's a
[7783.78 --> 7789.46]  little bread brontosaurus uh standing on a little pad of grass and there's a little cute little frame
[7790.02 --> 7795.06]  so i need creator warehouse to like turn into like one of the samsung's of the world where they just
[7795.06 --> 7801.78]  make everything yeah yeah create a warehouse insurance yeah um why not yeah why not yeah okay
[7801.78 --> 7810.58]  i think i also had a message from uh dbrand about the whole s24 like stylus something yeah okay here we
[7810.58 --> 7815.86]  go so they posted this on reddit um they have not found any difference between the performance of an
[7815.86 --> 7823.78]  s23 ultra s pen versus an s24 ultra s pen while a mag safe case is attached uh samsung has acknowledged
[7823.78 --> 7828.10]  the interference between magnets and the s pen going back as far as the galaxy note 8 they advise those
[7828.10 --> 7831.94]  who encounter magnetic interference to use the s pen with more force of course a lot has changed since
[7831.94 --> 7836.26]  then what can you expect when using a mag safe enabled case on your galaxy ultra
[7836.26 --> 7843.70]  uh okay this effects differs from accessory to accessory nevertheless logical conclusion okay okay
[7844.74 --> 7852.90]  okay sometimes they write a lot um here's how the rollout will work oh they're gonna have a non-mag
[7852.90 --> 7858.34]  safe variant for all their ultra model galaxy cases okay cool so if you if you're worried about it then
[7858.34 --> 7862.42]  you can just get one that doesn't have mag safe and doesn't have magnets in it okay or you can get one
[7862.42 --> 7867.14]  that does i guess maybe i'm not sure uh check it out on reddit the point is uh check out their new
[7867.14 --> 7875.06]  grip case now available for the samsung s24 series linked down below damn yeah how you doing over there
[7875.06 --> 7881.54]  i'm okay how about you you had a nice day bye i've had a i've had an okay day it sure looks nice tiring
[7883.38 --> 7889.22]  would you like a merch message um i mean i guess it's an option okay if we ever want to get out of here
[7889.22 --> 7893.86]  what do you guys do with teams i've never been logged out across four different employers and
[7893.86 --> 7898.82]  multiple computers do you use funky windows login configurations yeah luke we don't have yeah dan
[7898.82 --> 7905.14]  can you guys fix this no eventually oh you want to make it a you want to make it a a quarterly priority
[7905.86 --> 7911.94]  i mean i don't set them anymore but i would yes i find it really annoying i'm pretty sure we can fix it
[7911.94 --> 7921.78]  if we get um i always forget the name of it a ad jake told oh active directory yeah okay because jake
[7921.78 --> 7925.86]  told me like a thousand years ago that there wasn't a way to configure it but that was literally a
[7925.86 --> 7934.82]  thousand years ago so there is i i i threw some very light googling i think we might need ad um entra now
[7934.82 --> 7942.34]  okay yeah i don't know there is ways to to deal with it uh uh uh entraity not looking forward to
[7942.34 --> 7951.06]  that fine hi dll can you is this really gonna be that annoying the whole time i do not know that was
[7951.06 --> 7957.30]  not in my instruction okay never mind i take it back dbrand needs to pay extra if they're gonna have
[7957.30 --> 7960.50]  this down here it's also like the opposite of dark
[7960.50 --> 7968.98]  everything else is dark we have this like very bright daytime scene rip oled users yeah
[7970.10 --> 7975.30]  uh no idea i know we know there's like a lot of things that can be better i know what i was
[7975.30 --> 7980.10]  delivered a thing that was on fire we're working on it it's not as on fire anymore it's getting better
[7980.10 --> 7986.74]  okay you brought me into the fire i blame you as well that's fair hold on i can i can uh ruin some
[7986.74 --> 7996.02]  of dbrand's money there we go okay that's a little better oh no it breaks the whole thing though okay
[7996.02 --> 8001.54]  i'll just white stretch it just leave it oh no we can black stretch it there we go okay that helps
[8001.54 --> 8009.62]  maybe a little that's a little better thanks dan ah damn it okay uh hi dll can you talk about the
[8009.62 --> 8015.70]  early days of the forum and how you ensured a positive and safe community looking to start something
[8015.70 --> 8021.86]  similar to catalog and compile historical info about a specific place well our mod team was and is
[8021.86 --> 8030.74]  awesome and uh i part of it is that we just kind of have a pretty positive community so for the most
[8030.74 --> 8039.30]  part i mean i mean part of it was the you know vision for the forum was to not want to be like a toxic
[8039.30 --> 8045.06]  uh place where where put downs are considered to be acceptable between members um there's obviously
[8045.06 --> 8051.30]  exceptions it's any any where you put two people someone's likely to disagree with somebody about
[8051.30 --> 8059.94]  something and get heated but um there was also a way back there was a a mountain of work from
[8060.98 --> 8068.90]  the venerable mr wizard and these days mortis speaking of speaking of um these are our rules
[8068.90 --> 8075.14]  ensure a friendly atmosphere to our visitors and forum members ensure the freedom of expression
[8075.14 --> 8080.66]  and exchange of information in a mature and responsible manner don't be a dick will we be
[8080.66 --> 8086.18]  excellent to each other bill and ted remember your audience both present and future that's it yeah
[8086.74 --> 8092.18]  i mean we get more specific and all that but yeah but honestly that top bit is should be all you really
[8092.18 --> 8100.50]  need it really should yeah and yet it isn't correct um yeah the mods the mods hold it together yeah i mean
[8100.50 --> 8107.86]  it basically operates as a completely independent thing these days we we've taken more of the the
[8107.86 --> 8114.98]  admin server management stuff in-house to try to free up mortis as much as possible um so jonathan and
[8114.98 --> 8120.42]  tyler from the full plane team or have been on top of that but that's not the community fostering
[8120.42 --> 8124.98]  the community fostering has been all the the mods of the community itself yeah it's actually kind of
[8124.98 --> 8130.90]  hilarious how very independent from ltt it is these days like as far as i can tell it's a hotbed for
[8130.90 --> 8139.22]  ltt haters at this point yeah how ironic there's a bunch of that too which we always committed to not
[8139.22 --> 8144.66]  clamping down on and we stay committed to we are for for all the for all the criticism
[8144.66 --> 8151.70]  it's all still there one of the spoken but not written written original news uh wow that was a
[8151.70 --> 8156.18]  really difficult sentence for me i'm not sure why one of the spoken but not written original rules
[8156.74 --> 8162.26]  of the site was that in regards to going after people you could go after us and nobody else was
[8162.26 --> 8166.74]  fair game yeah that was kind of how it was supposed to be they really took that and ran with it they sure
[8166.74 --> 8177.38]  did yeah yeah hello ldl with the snowy canadian winters how do the linus socks and sandals combo
[8177.38 --> 8182.66]  work i'm actually wearing shoes today he is yeah there's like slush puddles that are this deep the
[8182.66 --> 8187.06]  slush puddles are rough the snow you can do but the slush puddles is it's just it's a puddle
[8187.62 --> 8194.98]  i have a whole technique for snow you like lift straight up and go straight down yeah and you can kind of
[8194.98 --> 8201.54]  make your way through it a little bit yeah but no i got you i got shoes on today hi wanda dl have
[8201.54 --> 8206.02]  you done any more research into automated cleaning bots like the one walmart has thinking of the
[8206.02 --> 8211.54]  badminton center no not yet i mean we're so far away from completion on that um i thought we're
[8211.54 --> 8215.70]  supposed to be done in march yeah it's already been pushed remember how i said i had nobody told me
[8217.70 --> 8222.74]  yeah you should probably tell i was not informed the people that are going to be building a bunch of
[8222.74 --> 8229.62]  stuff in the building i was not informed either sir oh okay i was unequivocally told march uh and then
[8229.62 --> 8235.38]  i said bet and then you were like no absolutely march what that there's shut up that's not what
[8235.38 --> 8241.54]  happened i die that is on the wan show no it is you can find that clip wait what when show database
[8241.54 --> 8248.18]  hold he'll find it please well there's no way i always say that construction is always delayed
[8248.18 --> 8254.34]  i i specifically remember somebody telling me unequivocally that it was absolutely going to be
[8254.34 --> 8262.10]  march was i being verbally ironic probably did we ever figure out what sardonic meant i i do not
[8262.10 --> 8268.82]  fully understand what sardonic means no no i think it's like a like a light-hearted kind of
[8269.70 --> 8277.46]  um like insincerity of some sort but it's not sarcasm or cynical okay sure yeah so then i clearly did
[8277.46 --> 8283.62]  not know okay well not being march makes things a little bit easier i don't have to lay awake at
[8283.62 --> 8291.62]  night stressing about it anymore um yeah great there is absolutely i mean come on yeah okay yeah
[8291.62 --> 8298.34]  when when database i'd love to i i'd love to know if i said that i find man i find that very hard to
[8298.34 --> 8304.66]  believe maybe i'm crazy i'll try to get that phone next week not important look the reality of it is
[8305.54 --> 8309.54]  i they're on it they're on it they're it's gonna probably take till next week but they're on it
[8309.54 --> 8315.70]  arthur's on it okay all right hilarious i'm gonna get lambasted if i'm wrong yeah so will i i i have
[8316.42 --> 8321.94]  dug in pretty hard here i have a feeling what might have been said is that that's the date we currently
[8321.94 --> 8328.18]  have so we should be at a full preparedness level for that date i doubt i said anything that
[8328.18 --> 8332.74]  complex planning for that date maybe that's what i said it sounds like something you would say
[8334.58 --> 8337.86]  i would say i don't know i think i would say something more along the lines of
[8343.94 --> 8351.06]  we'll figure it out well arthur will figure it out nice thanks cool hey dll thinking about oh do you
[8351.06 --> 8357.54]  want to know the new eta that would be nice uh yeah so um q2 q
[8360.66 --> 8364.66]  so april yeah maybe get it's still march
[8364.66 --> 8370.82]  where's my ding i'm going home where the is my ding
[8374.74 --> 8376.26]  that was pretty good thank you
[8380.26 --> 8385.86]  uh hey dll thinking about the potential of future tech or mechanical augments humans may potentially be
[8385.86 --> 8390.58]  able to make their bodies in the near future how far would each of you be willing to go
[8392.18 --> 8399.30]  uh um i think it would depend on how my body decayed yeah like when i'm when i'm when i'm young and
[8399.30 --> 8404.66]  functioning well when i'm like yeah whatever but if you told me like hey you can have glasses hanging
[8404.66 --> 8409.14]  off your face for the rest of your life or you can have like this bionic thing that we like drill into
[8409.14 --> 8412.42]  the back of your eye and put in there and then you like never need glasses anymore and your eyes are like
[8412.42 --> 8416.34]  better than they ever were i'm like okay as long as the success rate is pretty high
[8417.54 --> 8424.10]  i i think the thing that i have would have to be in a very bad spot and then if that's the case
[8424.10 --> 8429.78]  yeah i'm down like if i'm like mostly blind yeah yeah let's go but right now do i want something
[8430.50 --> 8435.94]  drilled into the back of my eye not really yeah yeah because like they're still all right
[8435.94 --> 8439.94]  they're not great but they're all right yeah they're not great you should really wear your glasses
[8439.94 --> 8444.58]  yeah okay cool i forgot them for the curling tournament again yeah yeah oh yeah how'd you
[8444.58 --> 8450.74]  try you never told me how the last day went they they made they made the uh the the finals of the
[8450.74 --> 8456.26]  consolation bracket yeah that's a really nice way of saying the losers bracket no it's a consolation
[8456.26 --> 8460.42]  bracket is it actually yeah oh i thought it was legitimately no that's standard terminology they call
[8460.42 --> 8466.26]  it group b yeah sure group b consolation yeah so i had a curling tournament as i said on the show and
[8466.26 --> 8470.18]  then someone tried to correct me and they're right it's called a bond spiel but if i say bond spiel
[8470.18 --> 8476.66]  no one's gonna know what the heck i mean um so it's a tournament whatever uh traditionally we were in
[8476.66 --> 8484.50]  the novice tournament um but we won like a bunch of times so i think that got annoying uh so they they
[8484.50 --> 8489.70]  decided to give my my uncle my brother and i who have never played a season of curling they gave each
[8489.70 --> 8495.78]  one of us a year of experience on paper um because we were at zero years of experience because we had no
[8495.78 --> 8500.74]  years of experience but because we had played in the novice tournament a decent amount of times
[8500.74 --> 8505.86]  they said that we had a year of experience which isn't equivalent but whatever um and then my dad's
[8506.66 --> 8511.38]  accumulated actually large amount of user experience because he's like he's like coaches the
[8511.38 --> 8516.58]  intermediate level or whatever all this crazy stuff yeah um that combined made it so that we had too
[8516.58 --> 8522.50]  many years of experience collectively on the team of my dad my brother my uncle and i um to play in the
[8522.50 --> 8530.26]  novice tournament anymore or the novice bonds bill um so we had to play in the like proper tournament
[8530.26 --> 8536.50]  yeah against real teams that really play yeah and if i remember correctly the year cap for the novice
[8536.50 --> 8545.14]  term is like 15 or something ah yeah so the novice tournament had good players in it right yeah and the
[8545.14 --> 8551.38]  real tournament has really good players in it everyone on that team has to have been playing for at
[8551.38 --> 8558.98]  least almost four years yeah like on average and a lot of people that go play at that club play like a lot
[8559.70 --> 8564.10]  right so because it's a curling club nothing else happens there yeah which probably has some stupid
[8564.10 --> 8568.74]  name like a foreign durf or something like if a tournament's called a bond spiel
[8568.74 --> 8576.58]  i love the creativity by that name um but yeah we we were often like you know the team to beat
[8576.58 --> 8582.98]  at the novice tournament um and then we we definitely got beaten this time um
[8585.30 --> 8592.34]  we beat one team did your rocks get socked they they got bopped at the very least yeah okay luke is a
[8592.34 --> 8607.54]  farndurfer confirmed um but yeah the the one thing for me is i try really hard to be useful so um i'm
[8607.54 --> 8615.86]  trying to play really well and with my shots but when we go to sweep i can generate a decent amount of
[8615.86 --> 8622.02]  power so i'm going for it but i'm going for it hard every time so the next day
[8622.34 --> 8628.82]  i'm really sore oh i see my problem with that is yeah you have a bit of a like sprint and collapse
[8628.82 --> 8635.54]  sort of mindset yeah in life yep it's um interesting we'll call it that sure
[8636.90 --> 8643.94]  i was gonna go with flaw but sure it works fine if you just never collapse yeah see yeah that's the
[8643.94 --> 8651.22]  thing so your wrong line is why you just continue um so the next day the soreness kind of threw my
[8651.22 --> 8655.22]  shots off a little bit right okay and your shoulder's been not perfect over the last couple
[8655.22 --> 8659.22]  years i've held together for the tournament really oh well okay everything physically was fine just the
[8659.22 --> 8664.58]  soreness like it's a lot of fine movements and stuff so when you're stiff when certain muscles are tight
[8664.58 --> 8670.10]  you're stiff the fine movement is going to change slightly so when there's no like practice shots and
[8670.10 --> 8674.50]  i haven't been doing this for a year i had it pretty dialed on the first day but because of how we
[8674.50 --> 8679.22]  placed we didn't we could have played all of our games on that one day and if we did it would have been
[8679.22 --> 8686.18]  fine but we played the next game the next morning or midday really yeah um and that meant that i i was
[8686.18 --> 8690.18]  just a little bit thrown off so i didn't play that well i didn't play the worst on the team i think i
[8690.18 --> 8695.78]  would say um but i didn't play that well in the next day um and i was doing pretty good the day before
[8695.78 --> 8700.58]  and then didn't you mention that uh one of your family members had to go like save lives or something
[8700.58 --> 8707.06]  yeah yeah my brother kind of does that all the time so he wasn't able to show up so like it just yeah
[8707.06 --> 8712.50]  we didn't end up doing is your brother's career a secret no he's a firefighter okay yeah so that's
[8712.50 --> 8719.62]  what we mean um yeah so it as the team that like tends to win these all the time it's taken a long
[8719.62 --> 8727.06]  time for you to arrive at you lost yeah but we were still in the money really yeah oh so you won more
[8727.06 --> 8731.38]  than you paid to enter the tournament is that what you mean i don't know if that ended up being true we got
[8731.38 --> 8737.14]  money back we were in a money placement but due to the like part of your entry you get like meals and
[8737.14 --> 8742.50]  stuff okay so i don't know if it actually ended up like making it positive cool we did get money back
[8742.50 --> 8748.18]  heck yeah hey shout out good job but so you so you came in second in the consolation bracket yes
[8748.90 --> 8753.78]  that's a pretty respectable result it was better than i thought yeah yeah i didn't think we'd end up in
[8753.78 --> 8758.34]  the finals yeah i was pretty happy we did that was a really long story when he could have just said
[8758.34 --> 8764.42]  uh yeah we lost it's a lot of excuse making i mean i already told you we lost i forgot you knew what
[8764.42 --> 8769.22]  position we were it came in yeah yeah i forgot though okay i i knew after the first day i remembered
[8769.22 --> 8773.78]  that part and then i didn't remember until halfway through your very long story that you had told me
[8773.78 --> 8778.98]  about rich not being able to be there and stuff oh i thought you wanted more information no i just got it
[8779.86 --> 8784.42]  second place equals first loser yeah i mean i don't know but didn't you come in second place
[8784.42 --> 8791.94]  in the loser bracket yeah it was like so he's like the second loser or like yeah a lot a lot
[8793.94 --> 8800.98]  yeah loser's cousin yeah yeah hi lld you all seem good at researching products to make sure they are
[8800.98 --> 8806.50]  high quality any tips on how to effectively research products before buying them to ensure it's a quality
[8806.50 --> 8810.74]  product worth buying customer reviews trying to find customer reviews that look like they're written
[8810.74 --> 8818.50]  by real people statistics um statistics five five star reviews is not as good as a thousand four point
[8818.50 --> 8824.02]  three star reviews yeah yeah yeah for sure that's a good one you you probably want a decent amount of
[8824.02 --> 8828.82]  reviews but not everything's gonna have it depending on what you're shopping for i always want to see a
[8828.82 --> 8835.22]  combination of professional reviewers who have spent realistically a limited amount of time with it but know what to look for
[8835.22 --> 8842.58]  and real users who realistically aren't as sure what to look for but sure you shoot know what's annoying
[8843.30 --> 8848.26]  uh i need both no i actually do think he cares his memory is just
[8849.62 --> 8854.18]  i care about what it's a thing what you're talking about people are saying you didn't care about the curling tournament stuff
[8854.66 --> 8857.62]  what curling tournament stuff it's curling
[8857.62 --> 8867.14]  what more do you want luke come on dan that didn't even win no he could have just like not asked
[8867.70 --> 8871.62]  he's just not necessarily gonna remember stuff like that that's okay yeah and i i did remember it just
[8871.62 --> 8872.26]  took me a little while
[8875.30 --> 8878.58]  that's why i prompted him for his brother not being there notice he didn't say that part
[8878.58 --> 8880.58]  got him
[8880.58 --> 8882.82]  got him
[8882.82 --> 8886.26]  uh maybe i just i you know the part i didn't remember was just that you lost
[8886.50 --> 8889.14]  actually i remembered the rest of the stories
[8890.18 --> 8892.82]  so maybe he was droning for so long
[8895.78 --> 8899.86]  with all of his excuses that he never made it to that part that might be true
[8900.50 --> 8901.30]  that's yeah
[8902.18 --> 8905.86]  um game i started or something yeah the last big tip is actually a really good one
[8905.86 --> 8909.06]  one is make sure you also read the one star reviews
[8910.66 --> 8914.18]  because if the one star review is just like my shipment got lost
[8914.90 --> 8918.42]  it got here late which is just like both of those are probably outside of the company's hands
[8918.42 --> 8922.50]  that has nothing to do with the quality of the product so what are you even talking about like
[8923.30 --> 8925.86]  um so you got to make sure that you're
[8928.26 --> 8932.82]  pinching whatever salt is necessary on the the pieces of information that might not be fully
[8932.82 --> 8937.78]  representative yeah you should jump around you should read the high ones read the low ones also read the middle ones because
[8937.78 --> 8941.46]  sometimes i find the middle ones will also have alternative product suggestions
[8941.46 --> 8945.62]  where they'll be like oh this was pretty good but i prefer this other one it's like oh maybe
[8946.26 --> 8949.94]  not necessarily you should just go buy that other one immediately but maybe you should go look at that
[8953.54 --> 8954.98]  um wrong tab
[8954.98 --> 8966.98]  uh
[8966.98 --> 8967.78]  uh
[8967.78 --> 8969.22]  i archived it okay
[8970.10 --> 8977.70]  hi ltt i work at the wikipedia foundation as a foss developer on wikipedia are there any features you wish
[8977.70 --> 8978.58]  wikipedia had
[8982.42 --> 8984.34]  i could try i could answer them slightly
[8985.86 --> 8991.78]  luke don't no i can answer them slightly i don't i don't really want to do a roadmap my reason for that
[8991.78 --> 8999.86]  is the team is extremely small so if if we want someone to work on something new they have to stop working
[8999.86 --> 9006.98]  on something else so sometimes things get shelved for a certain period of time we also are very small
[9006.98 --> 9012.58]  so if someone say gets sick that thing will just be on pause until they're back there often isn't
[9012.58 --> 9018.90]  another person to work on it um so people will get enraged when something gets delayed when sometimes
[9018.90 --> 9025.70]  it's just because like we're trying to not be mean to the people that work with us um and honestly one
[9025.70 --> 9030.58]  of the best solutions to that is just not really tell you guys what's coming until it's like in beta and
[9030.58 --> 9035.86]  you can play with it um so that's been a somewhat of a new strategy and with everything that i just said
[9035.86 --> 9043.06]  in mind i will not comment on the android tv apps i work at wikipedia found wikimedia foundation as a
[9043.06 --> 9049.38]  faucet developer on wikipedia are there any features that you wish wikipedia had um
[9051.70 --> 9057.30]  wikipedia is pretty good i yeah it does what i want no notes
[9059.70 --> 9061.38]  yeah i don't know keep it up kind of great
[9061.38 --> 9066.50]  like i actually found you know that the the ebay stocking scandal thing we covered i think it was
[9066.50 --> 9070.82]  last week i found the best coverage for that was just the wikipedia page on it
[9071.46 --> 9077.94]  yeah cool like wow it's pretty good um chat has some thoughts dark mode i mean
[9077.94 --> 9082.34]  it's such a simple site though you could just use a dark reader or something right i'm i am
[9082.34 --> 9086.58]  certain there are third-party add-ons to make wikipedia dark mode i'm surprised they don't have a dark
[9086.58 --> 9097.94]  mode but um solidarity let's go all right hit me dan why can't you emulate cuda on other gpus i know
[9097.94 --> 9103.78]  it's a dedicated hardware but emulators for consoles exist i'm not expecting 100 performance but one
[9103.78 --> 9109.62]  percent is still better than zero percent you forgot the last part of that message thanks for the butt
[9109.62 --> 9115.78]  cleaner i was pausing for dramatic effect wait the point of cuda is performance
[9118.26 --> 9125.38]  uh so i forgot we have this i can't think of any compelling reason to emulate cuda on other hardware
[9125.38 --> 9131.22]  i guess would be the main thing i'm sure that there's i'm sure that there are developers who might have
[9131.22 --> 9137.14]  more thoughts on this than i do but no i'm i'm not i'm not really um
[9140.34 --> 9145.86]  yeah i just i just can't think of a good reason to do it um why would anyone create that emulator
[9148.26 --> 9156.90]  the hardware is readily available um so you can you can get a cheap consumer card and use that for testing
[9156.90 --> 9165.46]  um yeah i just i just can't think of a good reason to do it you can even throw uh you can even throw
[9165.46 --> 9172.50]  an nvidia card in a system that doesn't that already has another gpu and just use it as a cuda accelerator
[9172.50 --> 9180.66]  like it's uh yeah someone in full plane chat said i lost it so i can't say their name but uh wikipedia
[9180.66 --> 9189.14]  needs video content um oh aero db there it is no yeah no you want to completely destroy their costs
[9189.78 --> 9198.10]  yeah add video yeah and honestly i can't think of very many articles that would need it no not none of
[9198.10 --> 9210.10]  them reading yeah it's a trip yep sounds hard um it can be yeah yeah apparently are cuda translation
[9210.10 --> 9216.42]  engines uh quantum jank says i was reading about one the other day um yeah but that would be that's
[9216.42 --> 9221.06]  not an that's not emulation though is my understanding my my understanding is that would be
[9221.62 --> 9225.22]  tools to allow you to recompile um
[9227.70 --> 9232.34]  but yeah guys for for real i am not a developer so take that for what it is
[9233.94 --> 9239.30]  and last one of the curated that i have when you do decide to change for the sake of change if you
[9239.30 --> 9245.94]  decide that at all what would it take for a new wanshow intro or set a new wanshow intro would
[9245.94 --> 9252.26]  require me to remember to remind ed to go after it and it would require him to have time to do it
[9253.46 --> 9262.26]  so that's that um as for the wanshow set um we would have to want to spend money on the wanshow set
[9262.26 --> 9269.14]  which i'm not feeling especially motivated to do right now yeah 2023 has been a challenging year
[9269.14 --> 9275.94]  and i don't see 2024 not being a challenge no yeah i feel like unless it moves i wouldn't yeah and even
[9275.94 --> 9281.30]  if it moves maybe you can just seems fine yeah it's in a state of flux you know what we could do is we
[9281.30 --> 9285.78]  could like um we could just rotate the whole thing 90 degrees we could have that in the back
[9285.78 --> 9292.10]  like we hold on here this is interesting what the coolest wall of the set never gets shown
[9294.18 --> 9295.94]  what why don't we just use that one
[9298.50 --> 9303.38]  what's going on whoa whoa
[9306.66 --> 9311.14]  there's something else on the wanset that's illegal
[9311.14 --> 9315.70]  how could this possibly be allowed
[9323.94 --> 9327.70]  hey that's a relic and slave the spire that gives you potions after every battle
[9328.58 --> 9334.26]  now that's a c200 i meant the white elephant right oh whatever
[9334.26 --> 9341.86]  obviously oh you've played i guess i don't know
[9344.50 --> 9349.22]  and are you gonna go all the way over to the other wall oh he's continuing i like this this is
[9349.22 --> 9354.42]  cool oh there's something stopping him it's the arm on the stand
[9357.54 --> 9359.54]  oh
[9364.26 --> 9369.54]  oh
[9373.54 --> 9373.94]  oh
[9373.94 --> 9374.66]  cam reception
[9380.34 --> 9384.34]  oh speed pan we're back
[9387.30 --> 9389.86]  what is that letter on the shelf i think we can't tell you
[9389.86 --> 9397.70]  if i remember correctly what that is we that's supposed to be private right i think so
[9401.14 --> 9404.74]  i think it i think there's a request in it to like not read it in a video or something
[9407.14 --> 9412.10]  i don't know if that's that one or not sometimes people send mail that they like don't
[9412.10 --> 9419.78]  you know this is not supposed to be a tweet this is supposed to be mail
[9423.94 --> 9424.18]  um
[9427.94 --> 9432.66]  it's fan mail for the they're just movies podcast oh never mind i thought it was something else no
[9433.94 --> 9438.42]  ah well i guess it'll keep living there all right dan hit me
[9438.42 --> 9440.26]  me
[9442.10 --> 9449.70]  hi wanda dlm need a home security system ubiquity is awesome but price is prohibitive unraid falls down on
[9449.70 --> 9455.78]  the gf approval factor needing vpn to local network suggestions on alternatives
[9455.78 --> 9464.58]  this is a really really good question and i think will require more investigation and research than
[9464.58 --> 9469.62]  what i have available to me right here right now on the show uh maybe chat will have some thoughts
[9474.34 --> 9482.34]  yeah that might be a forum one yeah for him yeah good suggestion yeah there are some good suggestions
[9482.34 --> 9487.06]  for how to deal with the vpn um situation like tail scale uh
[9490.10 --> 9497.54]  that's a very complicated situation yeah and if ubiquity is price prohibitive then a hundred percent
[9497.54 --> 9503.86]  this is a forum post and like a community has to figure out what it works exactly for your needs yeah
[9505.14 --> 9507.54]  because obviously it's just about ubiquity is great
[9507.54 --> 9519.94]  you're done uh okay up next hey j phil and nick today i proved that the rgb sweater works with the
[9519.94 --> 9522.98]  boss suit the jsu sense podcast
[9525.46 --> 9531.94]  tons of compliments on the look if nvidia ever manages to buy arm do you think they could topple intel
[9531.94 --> 9540.90]  and amd uh i don't i don't think that arm is the the threat to intel and amd right now um
[9542.34 --> 9550.34]  okay i shouldn't say that okay okay the latest snapdragon processors are making windows on arm kind of look
[9550.34 --> 9553.70]  viable that's pretty cool um
[9553.70 --> 9554.98]  um
[9556.74 --> 9562.98]  however for a long time you know the the the conversation around uh you know the big threat
[9562.98 --> 9566.58]  to intel and amd has been the data center and the inroads that arm is making there but
[9567.70 --> 9576.82]  um until and amd are still kind of kind of doing okay there and risk 5 is coming so fast like i played
[9576.82 --> 9579.94]  euro truck simulator on a risk 5 system
[9579.94 --> 9589.54]  that's actually kind of nuts yeah with 3d acceleration dude like it ran like crap but it
[9589.54 --> 9598.10]  ran the fact that it did anything it's crazy yeah um risk is good yeah i i i i i
[9599.46 --> 9604.98]  if he ever manages to buy arm i don't think they would want to i mean nvidia their ceo has said
[9604.98 --> 9612.42]  publicly that anytime intel is headed into a business they they would rather just not go
[9612.42 --> 9615.62]  head to head um i i don't i don't see them
[9618.18 --> 9623.30]  i i also don't see how they need to buy arm in order to threaten intel and amd's data center cpu
[9623.30 --> 9628.50]  business anyway like we've already got their super chip and stuff like that like i just i
[9628.50 --> 9635.94]  could they topple intel and amd no yeah no i don't think it's i don't think it's a topple so much as a
[9635.94 --> 9636.74]  as an option
[9641.70 --> 9649.06]  when do you decide uh sorry no that's it that's all i've got for um the curated there we go hey dll what's
[9649.06 --> 9654.58]  your opinion on the community porting spider-man 2 to pc i know linus's opinion on sailing the high seas
[9654.58 --> 9663.94]  but that's a different topic entirely um i did not know about this to be perfectly honest with you
[9663.94 --> 9666.90]  so i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to look this up
[9670.66 --> 9676.02]  luke had you heard of this you've seen this what oh the spider-man 2 thing yeah yeah i curated that
[9676.02 --> 9683.22]  because i was like schwatt uh i think that's a current gen console only game is that right yes
[9683.22 --> 9695.14]  it's ps5 an unofficial oh it is not this is uh according to game ramp it is not expected to be
[9695.14 --> 9701.86]  released after many of the people involved have withdrawn from the project an unofficial marvel
[9701.86 --> 9707.38]  spider-man 2 pc port was derived from materials leaked in the recent insomniac data breach and it
[9707.38 --> 9715.78]  has been scrapped ah yes um i think that i don't think that's different in the case of the nintendo
[9716.90 --> 9725.78]  um breaches and all the kind of historical you know artwork and assets and uh developmental history
[9725.78 --> 9730.90]  that was unearthed i was i was pretty supportive because these were products that had already made their
[9730.90 --> 9738.50]  money in the case of a game that is going to come to pc probably at some point i'm not sure if they've
[9738.50 --> 9745.38]  officially announced it or not but like is probably going to come to pc at some point but hasn't yet
[9745.38 --> 9752.18]  because of their relationship with sony and you know they're they're still very much actively monetizing
[9752.18 --> 9759.94]  this intellectual property i yeah i'm i don't know what to say other than that no um that's not really
[9759.94 --> 9764.58]  very cool you didn't you didn't make that game um it's not really yours
[9769.14 --> 9774.90]  also like insomniac aren't they kind of cool they should also shouldn't we be cool to them
[9780.34 --> 9785.30]  love the show has there been any progress with the water resistant ball cap i haven't seen her hair
[9785.30 --> 9789.30]  anything about it for a while me neither uh dan do you want to just forward this one internally and
[9789.30 --> 9797.62]  maybe uh they can get an answer sure i will send that to nick hello dll luke have you heard of spt
[9797.62 --> 9806.26]  that has to do with tarkov yeah uh i i think it stands for single player tarkov um
[9806.26 --> 9817.46]  yeah i i i not really my thing if i'm gonna want to play tarkov i'm probably gonna want to play it with
[9817.46 --> 9827.62]  someone else uh unless it if it supported co-op and the ai was good it could be a fun game uh but without
[9827.62 --> 9835.86]  co-op it doesn't really mean much to me um there's so many cheaters in standard tarkov that it's actually
[9835.86 --> 9841.78]  insane so like it would be kind of nice to get away from that um and they have a they have a bug right
[9841.78 --> 9846.66]  now where if you crouch walk at minimum speed you actually just make zero sound uh which in a game
[9846.66 --> 9855.54]  like tarkov is like kind of a problem um but there's always going to be problems with tarkov so it just kind of
[9855.54 --> 9862.34]  is what it is i don't know i would enjoy a uh like co-op tarkov i think that would be really cool
[9862.34 --> 9867.86]  but single player tarkov is not really my flavor but i can understand how it would be for some people
[9873.46 --> 9880.18]  um any more in curated or should i just start going through the um potentials i'm looking at
[9880.18 --> 9884.98]  the potentials uh yeah i was replying to potentials so luke if you want to pick some potentials for us to
[9884.98 --> 9892.34]  do out loud i'll go through and and i got a response back from nick light about the ball caps
[9893.14 --> 9896.66]  well that was fast very soon the order is in
[9899.86 --> 9902.50]  uh there's another one it's a quick and easy one
[9904.74 --> 9910.02]  yeah the uh the order is on its way to us it is currently in shipping thank you nick
[9910.02 --> 9919.70]  uh next question when will computer pet bed coming out oh soon yeah i think we just sorted
[9919.70 --> 9924.42]  out a packaging issue where the box was the wrong size it was too small and it was like
[9924.42 --> 9929.70]  crumpling it too much so we're gonna have a bigger box for it but yeah i think we're placing
[9929.70 --> 9936.98]  our order so so soon soonish like like on the order of weeks but not three like like more than a month
[9936.98 --> 9944.98]  worth of weeks but not like many many months right um this is a this is a weird one what are your
[9944.98 --> 9951.78]  thoughts on algorithmically managed network switches like what niall is doing have you ever heard of these
[9953.06 --> 9962.02]  no we did uh we actually participated in a campaign that cisco was doing um do you remember man do you
[9962.02 --> 9971.38]  you guys remember this hold on uh here we go oh yeah here we go here we go it sounds dangerous okay
[9972.02 --> 9983.06]  do you guys remember this campaign from cisco with peter dinklage no he basically walks around what is
[9983.06 --> 9987.38]  this like london or something i don't know he walks around some city for three minutes
[9987.38 --> 9997.22]  positing what if questions about you know a network that self-manages and then i remember working
[9997.22 --> 10002.58]  with the agency and being like hey okay so what exactly is it that you're promoting and they were
[10002.58 --> 10013.14]  like we're not sure we assumed you would know let me get back to you so i find so i yeah i ended up
[10013.14 --> 10018.90]  having to talk to engineers at cisco to explain like what this exactly it was that they were promoting
[10018.90 --> 10025.70]  but it was basically that what you're talking about like algorithmic monitoring and reacting to uh
[10025.70 --> 10034.10]  changes in uh network load or user behavior or whatever else um i mean theoretically it sounds super cool but
[10034.10 --> 10041.62]  i would need to hear from people who actually admin these networks before i was going to try to say anything
[10041.62 --> 10046.42]  intelligent about it on wanshow it sounds kind of like there was an onion article ages ago when the
[10046.42 --> 10054.90]  cloud was a thing hp has the cloud we definitely do and you can do all the cloud things on it we have it
[10056.26 --> 10062.50]  yeah pretty much and all of their marketing stuff was they had no idea it was great uh onion hp didn't
[10062.50 --> 10069.86]  actually like think that uh of course let's see let's uncover that one um question for luke i'm a
[10069.86 --> 10076.50]  mechanical engineer but a lot of my job has turned into software development i enjoy it and i'm
[10076.50 --> 10082.90]  apparently good at it but i feel like i don't know what i'm doing advice no one does stay curious enjoy
[10082.90 --> 10091.62]  your stay that's about it hello wangareens that's a new one that is a new one i like that i like this a
[10091.62 --> 10098.34]  lot have you ever felt external validation of your career choice from an unexpected person or event like
[10098.34 --> 10103.30]  some random person who thank you for a specific video i don't know if my mom ever told me she
[10103.30 --> 10104.82]  thought it was cool that would be unexpected
[10110.82 --> 10117.14]  it's funny because uh she's the one who got me into tech in a big way or in at least some ways um
[10117.94 --> 10124.58]  like we were the first people i knew with internet yeah like 14 4k baby um but then like at some point
[10124.58 --> 10129.70]  she just completely lost interest in it or something i don't know whatever um yeah
[10132.10 --> 10133.62]  shoot um
[10136.42 --> 10142.26]  it's always really random stuff you get recognized in and like you've mentioned this before but if
[10142.26 --> 10146.74]  you go into like a best buy it's like yeah okay yeah but you expected that yeah so that's an easy
[10146.74 --> 10153.22]  answer no no that's not what i'm saying um like those ones are easy expected etc
[10153.22 --> 10154.42]  um
[10159.30 --> 10167.14]  there's been for me it's always like people that do stuff that i think is like like like when when
[10167.14 --> 10172.82]  when we figured out that like people from nasa watch our show i was just like yeah that's pretty cool
[10174.02 --> 10179.54]  what i don't know like you're way smarter than yeah like what what's going on
[10179.54 --> 10186.74]  how can like anything i say be beneficial or interesting to you but yeah i don't know um
[10187.62 --> 10197.06]  it's cool hey dll linus you often refer to final fantasy 6 as your favorite games uh one of your
[10197.06 --> 10202.42]  favorite games if se were to remake it would you prefer to have it done in triple a fashion i.e
[10202.42 --> 10208.42]  7r or with 2.5d visuals more akin to octopath traveler
[10208.42 --> 10217.06]  i think having played 6 so many times i would actually be pretty open to a reimagining of the
[10217.06 --> 10226.74]  story more like 7 remake i would be unhappy with how long that would take like looking at how long
[10226.74 --> 10231.62]  all the parts of 7 remake are taking to come out like i'd be old and gray by the time i could play it
[10231.62 --> 10239.62]  um at this point especially because final fantasy 6 does not get enough love like what they're gonna
[10239.62 --> 10246.82]  remake set of like what what would you remake next after seven probably not six it's not no one's gonna
[10246.82 --> 10256.42]  remake eight nobody cares about eight except you you're the one person and no you don't count
[10257.38 --> 10263.70]  the one other one other person that was gonna say yeah i could see them doing it would probably be 10.
[10264.34 --> 10270.50]  i was gonna say 10. yeah but with worse voice acting i don't think that would be possible the ones that i
[10270.50 --> 10277.78]  hear spoken about the most in order is seven then six then ten and i i'm not even including you um
[10278.74 --> 10287.38]  yeah but the six community is really loud the 10 community is much bigger got it i mean it's
[10287.38 --> 10294.98]  frustrating for me because nine is if i'm being honest probably better than any of them nine is like
[10294.98 --> 10302.02]  never so good nine is so good it's glorious it's it's a masterpiece um people are saying yeah
[10302.02 --> 10307.54]  chrono trigger would probably get a remake before final fantasy 6 100 percent i accidentally just
[10307.54 --> 10313.78]  archived one where someone was asking me if i've made a burrito with my birds i don't know what that
[10313.78 --> 10322.42]  means you wrap it up in a little break in a in a and eat them no um no never well never done that except
[10322.42 --> 10327.06]  for when you need to handle them and feed them medicine and stuff but i've never done it for like
[10327.06 --> 10337.22]  fun they hate it um some larger birds are more comfortable with it but they not a fan linus as
[10337.22 --> 10343.06]  somebody who has successfully built and managed a tech focused business common misconception it is a
[10343.06 --> 10348.50]  media focused business but carry on it's linus media group that's right what advice do you have for
[10348.50 --> 10356.10]  individuals looking to start their own business in 2024 oh good luck i know the news says economic
[10356.10 --> 10363.06]  recovery coming that means it's not going to happen it's kind of tough times right now i um i i i i'm
[10363.06 --> 10368.90]  trying to figure out and you know what maybe there are places where you know things are different but
[10368.90 --> 10375.30]  i'm kind of trying to figure out what they're talking about i mean economists right they're experts they
[10375.30 --> 10381.14]  you know no or something maybe but there's a big difference between the stock market you know
[10381.14 --> 10386.98]  doing really good and what's happening to like real people yeah and the earnings well the stock
[10386.98 --> 10390.98]  market doesn't reflect at all what happens to real people it doesn't care in the slightest
[10391.86 --> 10396.02]  yeah uh people are saying interest rates are coming down yeah but that's that's rumored yeah
[10396.02 --> 10398.90]  interest rates are supposed to be coming down that will only help in certain ways
[10398.90 --> 10414.02]  it won't hurt in you know in general but um um you know go hard but play it safe
[10415.70 --> 10418.98]  you know make sure you've got something that has a has a has a clear
[10419.94 --> 10423.78]  value you know regardless of of what kind of economic times we're heading into
[10425.94 --> 10426.18]  yeah
[10428.90 --> 10452.82]  i'm going to be able to help you really yeah okay uh uh are you watching canucks games now that
[10452.82 --> 10459.46]  they're competitive or is it badminton hours till the end now um i i i i'm googling it
[10460.34 --> 10465.14]  i i stopped watching competitive i stopped watching nhl hockey after i think either the
[10465.14 --> 10469.22]  last lockout or the one before the lockout i was i've talked about this before but i was just kind of
[10469.22 --> 10475.38]  tired of um i got sort of disenchanted with the whole thing i stopped seeing teams as
[10475.94 --> 10480.82]  you know teams representing my city and i started seeing them for what honestly sorry to red pill you
[10480.82 --> 10486.18]  here but for what they are businesses they're businesses they build brands they extract money
[10486.18 --> 10493.06]  from customers you're not a fan you're a customer and they're not a team they're a business um and so
[10493.06 --> 10499.30]  i just it just it made it really hard for me to cheer and since i don't bet all of a sudden
[10500.10 --> 10505.62]  the stakes were really low for me and it just kind of drained the fun out of it i still love hockey i'd
[10505.62 --> 10512.90]  still love to watch hockey i would play hockey if i had the physique for it um it's it's just it's such
[10512.90 --> 10520.90]  an amazing sports it's it's great uh but i just i i also just don't have the kind of time that i used
[10520.90 --> 10526.98]  to back when i really followed it and watched every game uh with that said i read um i do know how things
[10526.98 --> 10534.34]  are going and i i pay attention to the cast of characters um they're having a heck of a season i mean i
[10534.34 --> 10539.70]  guess maybe this is maybe this is it we're due to uh to losing game seven in the finals it's been a while
[10541.30 --> 10545.14]  for those wondering it's happened three times we've never actually brought home a stanley cup
[10545.70 --> 10548.98]  but three connects teams 82 94 and
[10551.30 --> 10560.66]  2004 2006 yeah some sometime sometime around there um all three times to i think it was the islanders
[10560.66 --> 10567.30]  the rangers and then the bruins uh they went to seven games and he couldn't get her done so
[10568.26 --> 10572.66]  yeah was it 2011 thanks guys 2011 uh
[10576.18 --> 10582.90]  uh yeah it's uh it's it's it's i play badminton i don't play hockey and i i don't have time to watch
[10582.90 --> 10587.54]  games but i'm like i'll i'll just end up like slack jawed staring at the tv if there's a hockey game on
[10587.54 --> 10591.54]  in like a restaurant or something like that i don't have cable that was me too so i don't have
[10591.54 --> 10598.34]  an easy way to watch uh the one time i subscribed for cable i got a free trial right as the playoffs
[10598.34 --> 10605.14]  started so that i could watch the playoffs and then i canceled it after so yeah i do like hockey just no
[10606.50 --> 10613.38]  but yeah the the boys the boys are doing a bang up job this year yeah fine after you have built out
[10613.38 --> 10619.30]  your home network i know i guess as um as you've already finished your home network are there any
[10619.30 --> 10624.82]  updates or changes you would have done i'm about to finish construction on a new home looking to
[10624.82 --> 10631.22]  upgrade my current 60 to wi-fi to seven oh wi-fi seven's amazing uh the good news is that nothing
[10631.22 --> 10636.10]  will prevent me from just swapping out 60 access points for seven uh when the time comes i'm not
[10636.10 --> 10645.06]  going to bother until i have any seven devices in the house um more conduit i hey i replaced the
[10645.06 --> 10653.22]  displayport cable to my lan pc it was damaged i i'm pretty sure 100 now that it was damaged because now
[10653.22 --> 10660.90]  that i have a new cable in it's working perfectly but i was getting blanking issues and it took about
[10660.90 --> 10668.34]  three hours to go from the mechanical room through the theater over to the land center and then from
[10668.34 --> 10675.86]  the pole station in the land center over to pc1 and we actually buried two extras in the wall but they
[10675.86 --> 10682.90]  were both just short of long enough for pc1 like it would have been fine for station two three four or five
[10685.06 --> 10688.02]  but the conduit was a lifesaver i mean it would have taken me
[10688.82 --> 10694.90]  forever it would have taken me tens of hours of ripping out drywall and putting it back on and
[10694.90 --> 10700.10]  mudding and painting it like like it just if i wanted it embedded in the wall yeah more conduit
[10700.10 --> 10704.58]  is more better houses should just have conduit i probably would have run more fiber
[10707.78 --> 10713.70]  fiber's cool it's not necessary not for home but it's really cool i didn't know i was going to do like
[10713.70 --> 10718.98]  land parties at my house though you know like 50 users you know we're doing another one right yeah
[10718.98 --> 10724.90]  yeah wait it's gonna be good i don't know chase is gonna work march march oh do we have a date no
[10724.90 --> 10725.78]  it'll probably get pushed
[10732.98 --> 10738.58]  we still don't know who's in the right on that one yeah i don't care it doesn't matter we were gonna get
[10738.58 --> 10744.74]  it done no matter what yeah all right the time the time a little bit actually worried about the
[10745.54 --> 10753.14]  certain things because of that now but you know yeah uh let's see let's see as someone who's gearing
[10753.14 --> 10759.06]  up to start a company why are ethically run companies so rare nowadays how do you instill
[10759.06 --> 10769.94]  company ethics in your new hires i think we need to do a better job of integrating new hires we've
[10769.94 --> 10774.18]  grown really fast over the last couple of years and i think that culturally we've struggled a little bit
[10776.66 --> 10785.14]  that's totally not at all what the question was asking but yeah like oh oh yeah i guess they were
[10785.14 --> 10790.66]  asking about ethics not culture i consider ethics like a pretty key part of your culture though no
[10791.38 --> 10796.82]  he was asking how you do it and you said i said we haven't done a great job but we have at points
[10797.22 --> 10801.62]  okay i mean i guess i mean well do you not at all know how to do it
[10803.22 --> 10810.98]  well you just have to you have to just be a good example um trickle down ethics
[10810.98 --> 10819.86]  i i um i unarchived it well and it's not just that right like you also have to be willing to listen
[10820.50 --> 10825.78]  yeah like we've we've had we've had times when there's a lot of times from your perspective you
[10825.78 --> 10832.26]  won't see it whatever it is and so and a lot of times i still won't see it the first time someone
[10832.26 --> 10838.10]  brings it up i mean people's minds are hard to change right um including our own and
[10841.22 --> 10846.98]  i'm not perfect i won't be but um i think just trying matters a lot
[10850.34 --> 10855.54]  and i hate to be this guy but a lot of non-ethical practices lead to successful businesses so that's
[10855.54 --> 10862.26]  probably why you see less of them yeah we've definitely created trouble for ourselves that we
[10862.26 --> 10870.42]  could have avoided by just lying cheating or stealing yep and one one negative thing and i've
[10870.42 --> 10875.62]  brought this up a bunch the example that i almost always use is the uh developer speaking on stage
[10875.62 --> 10880.82]  at blizzard thing but it extrapolates to like everything but when a company does do something
[10881.86 --> 10889.54]  good uh by like admitting something or doing whatever else like anything on those realms and
[10889.54 --> 10894.58]  then the community just assumes it's the tip of the iceberg spearheads them for it yeah that can
[10895.14 --> 10901.78]  crush companies that are trying to do good things and just because the silent ones that are doing bad
[10901.78 --> 10906.34]  stuff you don't hear about because no one's bothering to investigate or do anything like that
[10906.98 --> 10913.86]  um those companies end up living and it's like it's a problem i've brought this up a bunch of times on
[10913.86 --> 10919.46]  the show but i think sometimes uh certain communities don't understand um like i see this in pokemon go a
[10919.46 --> 10925.86]  lot i've started playing because it gets me out walking and people scream so much in that game all
[10925.86 --> 10930.50]  the communities like i was all excited like this is really fun there's like events every weekend like
[10930.50 --> 10934.26]  this weekend i'm planning on going out it's gonna be snowy whatever i'll judge through it because
[10934.26 --> 10939.70]  there's some event do i really care about the pokemon no but it's some gamified thing that makes my brain
[10939.70 --> 10947.30]  want to go for a walk so i'm i'm diving in um but the community's just so mad all the time like
[10947.30 --> 10951.30]  i'm all happily playing this game and i look into like what's going on on reddit or whatever else and
[10951.30 --> 10957.38]  the whole thing's just a dumpster fire and it's like oh wow okay you don't don't have to be so mad
[10957.38 --> 10961.94]  about everything all the time and i think sometimes people don't necessarily understand they like
[10961.94 --> 10965.86]  really like this thing so they're really passionate about it and then something about it bothers them
[10965.86 --> 10971.30]  so they just scream to the mountains and they don't necessarily understand that newcomers to
[10971.30 --> 10976.18]  this thing also known as the thing that's going to help keep the thing that you like alive are going
[10976.18 --> 10981.06]  to be scared off by the amount of hate that's being spread all the time so like you kind of need to do the
[10982.18 --> 10988.34]  the compliment sandwich thing more often and in more realms uh because like
[10988.34 --> 10998.50]  if you only ever point out the bad you never point out the good then adoption is going to fall and
[10998.50 --> 11004.66]  then this thing that you like clearly considering you're still playing or enjoying it or doing engaging
[11004.66 --> 11009.38]  with it or whatever it is um is going to just completely die and you won't have it anymore so try
[11009.38 --> 11015.22]  to remember that that applies to companies that applies to video games that applies to whatever
[11015.22 --> 11024.02]  all right i think we've just got one or two more uh we had someone asking about oh did that get
[11024.02 --> 11030.98]  archived or answered or something all right see you later oh yeah no here it is michael asks what game
[11030.98 --> 11041.14]  do you think was most overhyped than underperforming versus the most unanticipated success so so underhyped
[11041.14 --> 11045.94]  and overperforming this year also this was the one i was more interested in what game do you think
[11045.94 --> 11051.94]  killed a studio the hardest this year because there was that um the golem didn't kill the studio no but
[11051.94 --> 11058.18]  that was that was a big blow that was that was probably the overhyped underperforming one yeah um what
[11058.18 --> 11062.98]  was that one that that recent one where they launched the game and it like was completely not what they
[11062.98 --> 11068.18]  said it was it's just a scam though i think that studio was dead no matter what okay it definitely got
[11068.18 --> 11074.10]  killed really hard that's true i don't remember the name of it um oh pal world looking hot yeah
[11074.10 --> 11076.90]  that's that pokemon with guns thing i kind of want to try it
[11080.34 --> 11084.98]  um yeah i don't remember the name of this game yeah the day after yeah i don't remember what it was
[11084.98 --> 11087.78]  something kind of like that oh shoot i just accidentally archived one all right
[11087.78 --> 11097.86]  i don't know what it's called but yeah it was basically a scam and then it got pulled because
[11097.86 --> 11107.06]  it was basically a scam something like that i think that is pretty much it yeah uh we will enjoy all of
[11107.06 --> 11113.54]  your the steve mocknecks um it's been pretty popular nice um
[11113.54 --> 11121.70]  um again we're still working on long t-shirt formats don't worry it's happening uh and we'll
[11121.70 --> 11134.58]  see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[11143.54 --> 11153.14]  bye
