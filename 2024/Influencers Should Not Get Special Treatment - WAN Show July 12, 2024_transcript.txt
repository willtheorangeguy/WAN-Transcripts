[0.00 --> 6.76]  What is up everybody and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week
[6.76 --> 9.32]  I forgot what the title of the video is so
[10.60 --> 13.16]  It's about the Tesla thing. Oh lordy!
[13.16 --> 21.98]  It has been alleged according to inside sources from Tesla that the company's self-driving training
[21.98 --> 27.50]  put more weight on training data from influencers and youtubers with Tesla vehicles
[27.50 --> 34.28]  In order to ensure that the people who were most likely to upload video of full self-driving functioning
[34.70 --> 40.36]  Had the best experience we're gonna be talking about that and how we feel about it. What else we got?
[40.36 --> 41.68]  Oh wait, no, I was gonna do two
[41.68 --> 44.54]  Yeah, I'll do two. I'll do two. What's going on?
[44.54 --> 50.26]  Nobody cares about the AI features on snapdragon X elite
[50.26 --> 57.34]  Whatever the order is snapdragon X elite laptops. What no one cares about the AI. They just want battery life
[57.34 --> 60.12]  That's it. Are you kidding me Luke? That's the whole topic actually
[60.12 --> 63.12]  Are you kidding me? But Luke, I thought AI was all that bad!
[63.12 --> 66.12]  Can you think of the children and their AI features?
[66.12 --> 68.12]  What else we got this week?
[68.12 --> 72.56]  Well, I wanted to do that topic but uh the Ryzen 9000 launched and
[73.78 --> 79.78]  Xbox Game Pass increased in price because apparently everything has to not just increased in price also got
[79.78 --> 83.44]  Convoluted as all get out. I can't wait to talk about that. Oh, no
[84.06 --> 87.88]  Dude, it's there's like five tiers of it now
[88.70 --> 90.70]  five tiers one two
[90.70 --> 92.70]  three four
[92.70 --> 94.70]  five
[94.70 --> 109.48]  The show is brought to you today by manscaped AG1 and see sonic of course alongside our secret lab chair partner whoops I mean our chair partners secret lab
[109.48 --> 113.76]  Whatever the point is there's the logo
[113.76 --> 132.40]  This is great north underscore star says this just in my tech illiterate aunt isn't a tech CEO obsessed with AI
[132.40 --> 138.52]  You're right. What? No the the AI versus battery life snapdragon
[138.52 --> 144.40]  The point is let's jump right into our headline topic which is of course that Tesla's self-driving
[144.40 --> 150.34]  Oh, I think self-driving is generous, but then again calling it full self-driving is also generous
[150.34 --> 153.90]  So let's just call it Tesla's driving assists shall we?
[154.42 --> 158.40]  According to business insider sources inside Tesla
[158.40 --> 166.96]  have claimed that the company's self-driving training puts more weight on training data from influencers and youtubers with Tesla
[166.96 --> 168.40]  and
[168.40 --> 172.40]  also CEO Elon Musk so
[173.16 --> 179.32]  That one is actually me. Well, no, I want to unpack that one a little bit more later first
[179.32 --> 186.40]  I want to talk about the influencers current and former employees say they were instructed to put additional resources
[186.40 --> 192.02]  into routes that were frequently driven by these VIPs for example
[192.22 --> 200.04]  Having employees who review and annotate footage for training having them spend more time on footage from these drivers
[201.76 --> 203.76]  Wow
[203.76 --> 207.72]  If effective this strategy means that Tesla's
[208.20 --> 215.46]  Full self driving would be significantly smoother and more accurate on these routes than it would be on a typical road
[215.46 --> 223.08]  It is therefore likely to conclude that the company wanted high profile drivers with large audiences to have a better experience
[225.16 --> 232.90]  Without even knowing that their experience was not representative of what the average user would see
[232.90 --> 239.30]  Which is super bad this is this type of activity is something that you have to try to look out for as a reviewer
[239.30 --> 245.12]  The the first way that I was introduced to it was people talking about golden samples
[245.12 --> 247.80]  Yeah, where companies will send you a
[248.40 --> 253.48]  Like known perfect version of their product instead of just picking one off the line
[253.48 --> 259.18]  And that can be a problem especially when you're talking about performance products. Yes, because we would talk about like golden sample CPUs
[259.18 --> 268.88]  Yeah, we're brand would send you a CPU that is like the best possible bidding which we've tested multiple times and never found evidence of in terms of our CPU sampling
[268.94 --> 271.24]  but what I've heard is that it was
[272.08 --> 281.38]  Potentially a practice in the earlier days of tech media. Yeah, especially when overclocking was a far more important aspect of reviewing a potential chip
[281.38 --> 288.42]  At one time that was like the main thing. That was the main thing I would read on articles when I was a kid. Yeah, but can you overclock the snot out of it?
[288.42 --> 290.42]  Yeah, yeah, um
[290.42 --> 297.44]  Now my question is because obviously there's the there's the things about this that are just generally skeezy
[297.66 --> 304.90]  Right like you you shouldn't want to misrepresent your product because it's gonna lead to bad experiences for your customers
[304.90 --> 313.38]  I mean we discussed this in detail when we did our video earlier this week on AMD's extremely misleading naming scheme for their rise in mobile processors
[313.38 --> 322.02]  It should be in your best interest as a company to accurately represent your products so that you create brand loyalty and people come back to you time and time again
[322.02 --> 325.88]  So I'm not gonna get too deep into that right now
[325.88 --> 330.84]  but what I want to talk about is is or should this be illegal?
[330.84 --> 332.08]  because
[332.08 --> 337.96]  Technically I don't think that Tesla is violating any law
[337.96 --> 342.54]  Nobody says that they have to that they have to manually
[342.54 --> 350.74]  Annotate the footage from every user equally they could have any number of reasons for focusing on a particular area
[350.74 --> 353.02]  Oh, we're doing a big focus on
[353.02 --> 358.72]  hilly terrain or we're doing a big focus. We're doing a big push on
[358.72 --> 365.22]  unusual signage or we we found that this user is in like the bottom 1% for
[366.20 --> 371.16]  successful self-driving sure so the area that they're driving in must be highly complicated
[371.16 --> 373.94]  Let's try to train on that data and figure out what's going on so they could offer up any
[374.30 --> 380.42]  Explanation for this that would be at least plausible enough that it would be difficult to nail down beyond reasonable doubt
[380.42 --> 388.06]  But they did this simply to juice the perception of full self-driving and built people into spending
[388.94 --> 391.92]  thousands of dollars for a feature that is
[392.26 --> 398.32]  Not going to perform the way that they might expect it to now there have been situations where it's not really bilking
[398.32 --> 404.02]  I think when Tesla offered a preview of full self-driving, I believe they offered a month was it two months?
[404.02 --> 406.78]  they offered a preview of full self-driving and
[407.24 --> 410.74]  Many people tried it out and were happy with it and kept it
[410.74 --> 415.20]  But many tried it out and kind of went this is this is not what I
[415.68 --> 418.52]  Expected and did not move forward with the purchase
[418.70 --> 423.50]  But there have been times when I don't believe there was a meaningful way to
[424.40 --> 427.74]  Get a refund if you bought it and correct me if I'm wrong
[427.74 --> 430.86]  Have they always offered the option to return within 30 days?
[430.86 --> 436.08]  I would love to hear you I would love to hear from you guys
[438.42 --> 441.86]  She's yeah, no not always yeah, I did I didn't think so
[441.86 --> 447.32]  I was pretty sure there were times when they were basically asking you to buy it sight unseen especially in the earlier days
[447.58 --> 450.26]  when the like the betas weren't even
[450.94 --> 456.20]  Functional from a from a fully self-driving perspective. So at what point?
[456.20 --> 461.56]  Do we look at this whole thing and does this become one of the like great?
[462.08 --> 464.08]  Scams of the 21st century?
[465.48 --> 469.26]  Yeah, I mean it's rough because it's been going on for half a decade now
[469.80 --> 478.76]  There are still people who will attack me for talking about how this has been how that how this has been a failed promise
[478.76 --> 486.98]  How it was so obvious from the start that still didn't weren't they the ones that announced that it doesn't work on hardware 3 or whatever?
[486.98 --> 493.82]  Yeah, oh people oh dude people are still so mad. What is up with your Elon hate boner or whatever else?
[494.24 --> 499.74]  It's not it's not Elon specific. I'm sorry. I can't I can't hear you with his in your mouth
[501.00 --> 503.00]  like I
[503.00 --> 507.76]  My job is just to cover the tech. I don't care. I don't care and
[508.76 --> 512.62]  Any company that lies so consistently about something so expensive
[512.62 --> 520.00]  I mean look look at it from this perspective if you bought one of that one of the first hardware 3.0 cars where they said anything running hardware
[520.00 --> 524.46]  3.0 will be full self-driving you could be done with that car by now and
[525.36 --> 527.36]  You never got it
[527.36 --> 530.12]  So someone in the chat said hold the influencer accountable
[530.12 --> 537.24]  Um, that doesn't work how the influencer doesn't know how could they know this is that's the thing we go out of our way
[538.68 --> 539.64]  Sometimes
[539.64 --> 549.08]  Like secret shopper for example. Yeah is a situation where we are trying we are doing everything in our power to best replicate the average users experience
[549.72 --> 555.66]  It's extremely time-consuming. It is extremely expensive. We have to bring in essentially
[555.66 --> 565.18]  Actors to play the role of the customer right because I can't just what call up star forge or call up main gear and place a purchase
[566.14 --> 567.98]  when I you know literally
[569.10 --> 575.02]  Know or have interacted with the ownership of these companies really like it doesn't work that way, right?
[575.26 --> 576.54]  so
[576.54 --> 581.50]  Secret shopping going incognito can be extremely challenging and
[581.50 --> 585.26]  And it's not even really applicable to a situation like this
[585.82 --> 592.70]  Where the only reason they own the car it's not like anybody gave them the car the only reason they own the car is because they're a customer
[593.58 --> 602.78]  And so as a customer they are fully entitled to experience it day to day. That's another thing. This is something that you can't really
[603.82 --> 605.18]  review like
[605.18 --> 614.78]  In a week it's tough, right? So I can't just I can't just hire someone to be a a tesla full self-driving
[615.82 --> 616.38]  Tester
[617.18 --> 621.82]  And then I mean, I guess conceivably I could but I would have to I would have to hire them to just
[622.70 --> 627.02]  Drive the car around or not all over the place sit in car
[627.74 --> 630.70]  All the time for some extended period of time
[630.70 --> 639.58]  Incognito and then like funnel that data back to me with no tie between the car and myself and I'm just I'm looking at it going like this is
[640.54 --> 647.90]  You've got to understand what you're asking sort of these average sort of car channel or or technology channel people to do like it's not
[647.90 --> 652.86]  If it's not even if you're a really big time car car channel and and have the funds to do that
[652.86 --> 655.10]  Is that what you really want to spend spend your funds doing?
[655.98 --> 657.98]  dodging their
[657.98 --> 659.98]  training things so they can't tell that it's you like
[661.18 --> 662.22]  the heck
[662.22 --> 666.46]  No, yeah, there's there's no way that they could possibly be responsible for it
[666.70 --> 670.38]  There are due diligence things that we as you know
[670.70 --> 677.02]  Influencers or media or journalists, you know the people who cover this stuff and at their it from their various angles, right?
[677.26 --> 679.26]  There are things that we can do to
[679.26 --> 686.46]  Anonymize ourselves, but in this case they had no reason to even I mean this is some tinfoil hat level here
[687.10 --> 689.50]  Like that they're going through and fine-tuning
[690.46 --> 694.94]  The roads that full self-driving works on to be repr to be better
[696.06 --> 698.78]  Where I'm for where I drive I mean
[699.98 --> 701.98]  What kind of like?
[701.98 --> 705.50]  Narcissistic asshole would you have to be to even think of that
[706.06 --> 712.38]  To even think that the companies that makes the products you buy are going to fine-tune the experience
[712.94 --> 714.94]  Just for you
[715.02 --> 718.78]  Yeah, yeah, and I'm sure somebody thought of it, but like
[721.42 --> 726.30]  Clearly it's and clearly it's real, but this just this blew my mind. You could like you could um
[726.30 --> 734.94]  I could see ways if depending on the compute in the car that you could have it training actively specifically for
[735.74 --> 737.74]  You in your area
[737.90 --> 742.22]  Yeah, but that isn't what they do because they train the model off-site and yeah
[745.42 --> 751.74]  Now the next thing that I want to unpack is the fact that it is specifically tuned for the routes
[751.74 --> 754.06]  I don't I don't that mr. Musk drives now
[754.06 --> 755.66]  Hold on. I don't know if this is a problem
[757.90 --> 764.14]  Personally okay, I can give my i'm going to i'm gonna i'm gonna take your take sure and then i'm going to
[764.94 --> 765.74]  obliterate it
[765.74 --> 766.78]  Okay, yeah
[767.34 --> 768.38]  I so the the
[769.10 --> 773.10]  You know, there's probably something negative along with this, but the first way that I read that
[773.66 --> 775.42]  uh, was more based around
[775.42 --> 777.42]  Elon being
[778.30 --> 783.02]  Very open and giving with the data of him driving so he's like whatever train on this as much as you want
[783.66 --> 785.66]  not necessarily
[786.46 --> 789.98]  I want all my routes to be perfect here's my two reasons it's terrible
[791.74 --> 796.46]  Actually, they're really one reason that is no there are two reasons there are two reasons that it's terrible
[797.18 --> 799.18]  No, it's one reason
[799.18 --> 802.94]  The reason okay, hold on hold on because think about if we did something you would want it tested on you
[802.94 --> 805.66]  All the products and ltc store are made like for you
[806.62 --> 807.90]  Okay
[807.90 --> 809.02]  But here's the problem
[809.74 --> 813.98]  If you handed me a golden sample that was different from the one you give the customers
[814.54 --> 816.38]  I would be livid
[816.38 --> 820.14]  All right. Yeah fair enough. Yep, because you're making a fool out of me
[820.78 --> 826.14]  I'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna sell them on the features and performance and quality
[826.86 --> 830.30]  And then they're gonna get something that is not what I promised
[830.30 --> 837.10]  Essentially whether you whether you misrepresented it to cover your own hide or whether
[837.66 --> 838.54]  I am
[839.26 --> 841.26]  I don't know misguided enough
[841.26 --> 845.90]  You should almost have like to demand that the least trained on data. I should be the most
[846.54 --> 852.62]  Anonymized user. Yeah, so i'm getting the most real experience now. I can understand from tesla's perspective
[853.34 --> 855.34]  Why they don't want his car
[855.98 --> 859.34]  Especially to just swerve into a telephone pole
[859.34 --> 862.30]  But if other people are gonna drive in it, you should be confident enough
[862.94 --> 864.94]  That you're willing to do that
[864.94 --> 868.94]  Exactly. Yeah. No i'm on board now. All right. Yeah, good enough. But it was a good effort
[871.26 --> 876.22]  I so like I it's I mean it's the same reason why I like having customer support close to developers
[876.70 --> 881.50]  Yeah, is because you you need to hear and understand the daily problems of the users
[881.50 --> 885.10]  Um, because you know, you're not gonna be able to solve every single thing that comes up
[885.10 --> 891.98]  Exactly, but you shouldn't be shielded from them. Yeah, that is the biggest problem that I have encountered time and time again
[892.38 --> 894.78]  with management level people
[895.26 --> 901.18]  Especially in larger organizations. Yeah is the more removed they are from the day-to-day operations
[902.14 --> 906.14]  The more they just don't have any chance of understanding the customer. Yeah
[906.14 --> 910.38]  Yeah, and the more the more misguided their product development gets
[911.10 --> 915.50]  Even even in an organization our size. I feel it sometimes oh, yeah
[915.50 --> 921.18]  Where i'm sitting there going oh, really and and this is coming from someone who is reading your chat
[921.74 --> 922.62]  right now
[922.62 --> 930.78]  This is coming from someone who who reads comments who also reads the daily summary getting an outside perspective from our community coordinator
[931.10 --> 932.06]  uh, steven
[932.06 --> 936.38]  Um on what you guys are saying. I feel so official to hear you call him steven
[937.26 --> 938.62]  Chewy
[938.62 --> 946.06]  I still have blind spots and it's just inherent to getting larger like i'll find out about it. Okay here. Where's that thing dan?
[946.70 --> 948.70]  Can I please have the thing?
[948.70 --> 955.50]  The thing you showed me before the show the terrifying thing. Oh, okay. I would like it. Oh my god. Oh, really? Okay, actually
[956.46 --> 961.10]  Okay, I just about crapped myself when I saw this. It's not done. Yeah, that's fine. It doesn't matter
[961.50 --> 963.58]  There's actually a lot more that's gonna be added. Okay
[964.30 --> 965.82]  this
[965.82 --> 973.50]  This is the process flow. There we go for the creation and publication of an ltt video. What is it missing?
[973.50 --> 978.22]  Dan, it's missing it's missing the pre-production steps. So that red box in the center there there
[978.70 --> 985.18]  Uh, is the entire pre-production steps when the video is planned with what when it's going to be shot where it's going to be shot
[985.18 --> 989.02]  What do they need? When is the shooter assigned? Good flipping gravy men
[989.18 --> 994.06]  So remember when in the in the pre-show I pointed out how much live stream on full plane costs?
[994.38 --> 995.02]  Yeah
[995.02 --> 998.62]  One of the questions I had the first time I saw that was how much does that cost?
[999.50 --> 1002.94]  A lot I bet! How much does every one of those jumps take time?
[1003.42 --> 1009.10]  How much time is just in jumping that many times? Every time somebody orders something logistics has to do work
[1009.34 --> 1013.26]  Every time somebody uses something in inventory logistics has to do work
[1014.22 --> 1018.22]  It's I mean people keep asking the knock-on effects. Why this has like a hundred people?
[1018.54 --> 1022.14]  How do they not have like a video immediately about everything? It's like how many?
[1022.54 --> 1024.54]  What percentage of them do you think work in writing?
[1025.58 --> 1034.14]  Support staff is incredibly important and so valuable and invisible to you guys in the end product
[1034.14 --> 1034.94]  I mean look
[1036.14 --> 1038.14]  Do yourself a favor, okay?
[1038.14 --> 1040.22]  Next time you go to a movie in the theater
[1040.22 --> 1044.86]  First of all, give yourself a gold star for keeping that dying industry afloat
[1044.86 --> 1049.42]  And then second of all don't walk out when the end credits start
[1051.58 --> 1058.14]  Watch the whole list scroll by obviously we don't operate on a hollywood level either in terms of our budgets or
[1058.38 --> 1061.98]  We're not filling coliseums with water or our production complications
[1062.62 --> 1070.78]  But it should give you some idea that it's not as simple as you know linus and two of his broskies on set fooling around with computers
[1070.78 --> 1074.14]  There's so many touch points
[1074.14 --> 1075.58]  Oh, they go all days
[1075.58 --> 1077.98]  There's that many touch points and we're not producing one
[1078.78 --> 1083.02]  At a time. Yeah, there's like 20 or 30 that chain is parallelized
[1083.66 --> 1084.94]  30 times
[1084.94 --> 1089.26]  It is insane. It touches every single department in the company including cw
[1089.42 --> 1093.10]  How we started doing that was we were we were looking at our
[1093.82 --> 1095.50]  That's just this week that i've done that right?
[1095.50 --> 1100.06]  Yeah, and that wasn't even the original task, but now it's like the clearly more important one
[1101.02 --> 1104.22]  The original task was okay. We have we have teams. We have slack. We have
[1104.78 --> 1107.82]  uh g suite we have outlook we have
[1108.46 --> 1114.06]  People text each other people discord each other people call each other people call each other on teams people call each other on meet people
[1114.22 --> 1116.78]  Like oh, yeah, there's a bunch usually calls me on whatsapp
[1118.70 --> 1120.70]  I
[1121.02 --> 1126.46]  So we're trying to figure like what are all the communication methods at the company and what do people anything highly confidential?
[1126.46 --> 1129.74]  I almost always message yvonne somewhere else
[1131.02 --> 1135.90]  Just so you know as long as the somewhere else is good, then that's fine. It's good. It's end-to-end encrypted
[1136.30 --> 1139.50]  Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, i'm just saying i'm just saying I don't need that and we don't need that
[1139.50 --> 1144.86]  I'm, just saying i'm adding it to your list is that if something is like of that is how it should work
[1144.86 --> 1149.10]  Yeah, if you wanted recommendations our team. No, no i'm good. I'm just saying it wasn't in your list
[1149.10 --> 1153.90]  So i'm just helping yeah, but it's so we were trying to map. Yeah, what communication software do we use?
[1153.90 --> 1157.42]  How does it get used when does it get used jamie leaves post-it notes for me?
[1158.78 --> 1160.78]  Dear god really
[1161.18 --> 1165.10]  I'm going to cry. Well, did you see how many times the mirror in my office fell down?
[1165.90 --> 1170.30]  So he leaves post-it notes for me every time it falls down saying it's definitely fixed this time
[1172.54 --> 1177.66]  And also other post-it notes. I mean that's that's just fun. That's fine. Keep doing that
[1177.66 --> 1183.66]  um, but yeah, and then and then this like spider web started forming and uh
[1184.62 --> 1187.82]  Yeah, I mean this has been something that i've wanted to look at for a long time. Yeah
[1187.82 --> 1193.58]  And it's really interesting seeing where the potential communication breakdowns are because for example
[1193.58 --> 1197.50]  The entire editing stage is done through teams dms between the editor and the writer
[1197.50 --> 1204.30]  And so if the writer is working on four or five videos simultaneously, then he's managing four or five different individual email
[1205.26 --> 1210.14]  Teams dms with four or five different editors that are in multi-stage production, right?
[1211.98 --> 1215.74]  Things get wacky and like some of this stuff is gonna have to keep happening
[1215.74 --> 1219.50]  Oh, yeah, but we need to be aware of that so that if we pick a new communication suite
[1219.50 --> 1223.50]  It needs to be able to handle these use cases that we already have something that i'm trying to find
[1223.50 --> 1229.58]  Break the whole company because we try to migrate us to a different chat client. Yeah, uh entry and exit points for communication
[1229.90 --> 1235.66]  Yes, you want to buy a thing who is notified when are you re-notified when that next step has happened, right?
[1235.98 --> 1239.74]  It's crazy. It's not crystal d fear asks. Why is there a mirror in your office?
[1240.06 --> 1242.22]  It's a fair question given the state of my hair today
[1242.22 --> 1246.78]  But in theory i'm an on-screen talent and should probably know what I look you know
[1247.90 --> 1252.62]  That would be a genuinely pretty funny flow plane exclusive is in the i think it was the
[1253.50 --> 1256.30]  Reviewing the best rigs that we've done over the years video
[1256.86 --> 1265.02]  Uh, we turned it into like a linus hair review part way through if you remember that i do they should actually do a like linus's hair over the years
[1265.98 --> 1268.46]  Video there's some pretty wild stuff
[1269.34 --> 1275.18]  In the early ncix tech tips days because it would just be whatever I rolled out of bed with yeah, and it would just be
[1275.58 --> 1278.54]  Sometimes it'd be duke nukem bleach blonde hair. Yeah
[1279.10 --> 1279.98]  um
[1279.98 --> 1282.46]  There there were there were some as
[1283.18 --> 1288.14]  Appearing on camera like basically every day with no schedule other than when I have time to do it man
[1288.78 --> 1292.30]  I've had some mondo zits. I've had some
[1293.26 --> 1295.26]  supremely bad hair days
[1295.90 --> 1301.98]  I've made a lot of questionable fashion decisions in my life. Um all of those are well documented
[1301.98 --> 1308.86]  Yeah, it is what it is. So that's cool. I'm i'm actually i'm going and i'm looking right now
[1308.86 --> 1312.62]  I'm i'm going to i'm going to ncix tech tips here. I mean yeah
[1313.50 --> 1318.14]  I don't even know who this guy is, but don't don't worry about him who gets the adsense payout for this these days
[1318.70 --> 1320.38]  I have a theory yeah
[1320.38 --> 1325.34]  Like but that's just a theory yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm not going to say what my theory is
[1325.90 --> 1327.90]  I have a theory and it's uh
[1328.54 --> 1332.22]  It's not the most like up and up theory, but it's a theory all right
[1333.10 --> 1338.22]  Yeah, really I think someone's getting it. Yeah, and I don't think it's anyone who
[1339.58 --> 1341.82]  Works at ncix. Yeah, well
[1343.34 --> 1349.90]  It isn't me i'll say that one's good. That one's good. This one. Uh, no middle left the blonde. Oh, oh lordy
[1349.90 --> 1353.02]  The super blonde. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Yeah
[1355.42 --> 1357.42]  Let's go. Yeah
[1357.82 --> 1361.66]  Um here here is a just got out of bed day. That's for sure
[1362.38 --> 1369.42]  Uh, yeah, I don't know what that is 14 years ago. I know right. Oh, man. What remember this cringe? I
[1370.38 --> 1371.82]  Lizard hat
[1371.98 --> 1378.06]  Yeah, so that was that was airbrushed for me on a like sidewalk in victoria or something
[1378.06 --> 1379.10]  Yeah
[1379.10 --> 1384.94]  Had like a a gecko on it or something. I don't even I don't even I don't know what I was thinking you guys I
[1385.98 --> 1390.22]  That dude that hat made a lot of appearances though. That might be it. Oh, it might be a different hat
[1390.22 --> 1392.86]  It doesn't matter. The point is that oh god, it's back
[1395.98 --> 1401.26]  Anywho so good the bleach blonde was that was a that was a classic dbrand wanted to bring it back
[1401.26 --> 1406.30]  I thought they were gonna sponsor me to diet again on the show or something. I'm down dbrand come at me
[1406.30 --> 1407.10]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[1407.10 --> 1411.82]  It's gonna be a big bag of money or i'm not doing it though because my wife is not gonna be into it
[1413.18 --> 1415.18]  Not gonna be into it
[1416.46 --> 1418.86]  Uh speaking of hair stuff, how's the painting going?
[1421.10 --> 1425.02]  Well, I told you already that I had to completely strip the wheels, right?
[1425.02 --> 1431.10]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I stripped one of the wheels which took me I don't know two or three hours or something like that
[1431.50 --> 1435.58]  So I stripped one of them down to like primer slash bare metal
[1436.14 --> 1440.14]  Thinking that they would be close enough that if I painted them to get
[1440.86 --> 1442.14]  Not even close
[1442.14 --> 1444.62]  So i've got to go all the way down to bare metal on that one
[1444.62 --> 1450.54]  So i probably got to put like another hour into it and then i'm gonna have to do the other wheel then i'm gonna have to try again
[1451.10 --> 1452.38]  um
[1452.38 --> 1454.54]  I don't think i'm i don't think i'm riding this summer
[1455.18 --> 1455.42]  oh
[1456.38 --> 1458.62]  but maybe that's okay because i
[1461.42 --> 1470.70]  Next summer it's it sucks it sucks because um, yvonne is finally taking some long overdue mat leave
[1471.42 --> 1474.06]  uh this summer so as of last week
[1474.78 --> 1479.66]  Last week or the week before so either no last week the beginning of last week
[1479.66 --> 1484.14]  She's not in office for the entire summer because she's still working
[1484.14 --> 1484.94]  I know
[1484.94 --> 1488.62]  I was giving her a hard time yesterday because she was like working too much
[1489.10 --> 1494.54]  She's she she agreed to work and uh a day a week, but she's been doing more than that
[1494.54 --> 1498.38]  But anyway anyway, okay, the point is she's finally theoretically
[1498.86 --> 1505.98]  Taking some long overdue mat leave because I mean you remember this back when back back when our firstborn was an infant
[1505.98 --> 1507.50]  We wisely
[1508.30 --> 1513.82]  Founded a company together and so she spent all the time that she had off from her job
[1514.38 --> 1518.86]  Doing this other job and then had to go back to her old job and effectively have two jobs
[1519.98 --> 1525.10]  From then until like what like five years later or something how many years it was
[1525.10 --> 1527.58]  Yeah, somewhere in that neighborhood and then
[1528.46 --> 1530.54]  At every point where we had a kid
[1531.66 --> 1532.78]  She
[1532.94 --> 1537.10]  Was working and like obviously like we couldn't pay her because
[1537.98 --> 1543.26]  She's not working or whatever, but she had a lot of stuff that if she didn't do it
[1543.26 --> 1547.98]  It would you know if she didn't spin those plates they would fall and break so
[1547.98 --> 1549.50]  So
[1549.50 --> 1554.54]  So she did a lot of work even though she was also caring for an infant which is a full-time job
[1555.10 --> 1558.46]  um, and so finally now that our you know
[1559.26 --> 1562.62]  Tal that our second is nearing the decade mark
[1563.10 --> 1568.14]  um, she's she's getting a summer off with the kids to to hang with kids and do kid things
[1568.78 --> 1574.70]  um, so thank goodness for that that's uh, that's amazing and I forget where I was going with this right
[1574.70 --> 1579.58]  She doesn't really want my hair to be blonde. I think that's what I was talking about people are asking for mine as well
[1580.06 --> 1582.06]  And I'm I'm saying
[1582.06 --> 1587.42]  Valhalla for the company. Oh if they pay enough i'm down. Okay. All right. It's gonna cost double
[1587.74 --> 1594.14]  It will look really bad on me. It will it'll look atrocious. Oh, you're gonna look awful. Yeah, especially if you keep the beard. Yeah
[1595.42 --> 1600.14]  You're gonna look like an idiot. No one wants me to remove so it's probably gonna stay on anyways. Yeah
[1600.38 --> 1604.46]  I could just do both. You can't dye it. Okay. Yeah, no, it's it's a completely different
[1604.46 --> 1608.46]  Composition of hair. It doesn't take dye nearly as well like you can do it
[1608.78 --> 1613.82]  Like you see people that have like, you know the purple braid in the beard or whatever like you can do it, but it's
[1615.82 --> 1621.02]  It's a lot more like pubes. Yeah, you know where it's that really wiry hair that you get when you go through puberty
[1621.02 --> 1626.62]  So it like literally is yeah, so it's it's that really wiry hair and it just doesn't take dye nearly as well. That makes sense
[1627.58 --> 1629.58]  I don't know what will look stupider
[1630.30 --> 1633.58]  No, if you try to dye it. Oh, or if you just don't try
[1635.66 --> 1641.02]  Because your head hair you're you're really blonde, right? So you're gonna go you're gonna be like
[1642.14 --> 1647.26]  Like white blonde. Yeah, whereas I am kind of a dirty blonde
[1647.98 --> 1648.86]  um
[1648.86 --> 1653.82]  But I tend to go more of like a yellow and especially because I want to have more pigment in my hair my hair
[1653.82 --> 1659.42]  Becomes a lot lighter when I spend more time in the sun and based on my upcoming schedule
[1659.42 --> 1664.38]  I'm gonna be spending a lot of time in the sun. So it's gonna be quite bright anyways. Oh, you got some vacation coming up?
[1664.62 --> 1668.38]  No, I just have a lot of plans to be outside nice. Yeah, it's gonna be good nice
[1669.50 --> 1674.62]  We're good. We're gonna look like idiots with matching hair dye jobs. Oh, yeah, which were the same shirt
[1674.62 --> 1684.38]  If they pay triple is Dan gonna do it too is Dan talking about it
[1684.78 --> 1688.54]  Wait, he's talking about doing silver. Yeah, you can't dye your hair silver Dan
[1688.54 --> 1693.66]  I was wondering like does it do we do a different color or it is it both blonde? Oh, it has to be blonde
[1693.66 --> 1698.62]  All right, are you in I mean, it's it's hell. Yeah, it's night. It's 1997, baby
[1700.06 --> 1702.46]  We should just frost the tips. We should get like puka shells
[1706.46 --> 1712.30]  Oh, man, we're gonna have to do a special edition, uh, like shirt or something like that. It should be a polo shirt
[1712.30 --> 1715.82]  The bro fist shirt, uh, but like our hair's blonde
[1717.74 --> 1723.34]  And then oh, but how do we integrate Dan? We gotta have Dan in there. We gotta have Dan. Should I just be in the middle going like this? Wow
[1723.66 --> 1725.66]  And then we'll have a couch behind it wait. Oh
[1730.54 --> 1732.54]  As I said i'm down
[1733.74 --> 1738.46]  I mean you saw that fist out right like what did you think was gonna be happening?
[1745.74 --> 1749.50]  By the way, by the way since we're getting all erotic right now anyway
[1749.50 --> 1750.54]  Oh, wow
[1750.54 --> 1755.98]  Yeah, so so when I was when I was touching my my chest to kind of show the shirt. I have boobies now
[1756.86 --> 1763.50]  I've been swimming. I've been swimming. Yeah, probably two of every three days for the last little bit last night
[1763.50 --> 1765.50]  I did a kilometer
[1765.90 --> 1772.22]  Which is not a ton, but it's a lot more than not swimming for a kilometer. Yeah
[1772.22 --> 1776.62]  Um, and so I did um, how do you okay just laps? Yeah
[1776.62 --> 1782.14]  Yeah, yeah, so every every length is about 13 meters or something like that or whatever it works out to
[1782.54 --> 1789.34]  Um, so so one lap is 25 meters and I go out of my way not to push hard off the wall like i'll just position myself
[1789.34 --> 1791.34]  But then i'll like swim. Um
[1792.06 --> 1795.82]  Check it out. I got boobies. Yeah, just a little bit. I can visibly see
[1795.82 --> 1802.46]  Flex it hi. I don't know how yet. Oh, um
[1806.38 --> 1811.74]  Oh, maybe a little I think I can do it a little how do you not know how flex your yeah, there you go? Yeah
[1813.02 --> 1815.02]  I've never had any muscle there
[1816.94 --> 1820.46]  Chest muscles weird because you don't actually really use it for like a ton of stuff
[1821.10 --> 1825.42]  You sure as heck use it for swimming. Yeah, I've been really sore dude. Yeah, yeah
[1826.14 --> 1832.30]  Anyway, honestly the big time and that was confusing me too. Have you never tried to flex your pecs before? I've never had
[1832.62 --> 1834.78]  pectoral muscles to speak of something
[1836.06 --> 1841.34]  Guys back me up on this back me up in the chat if you don't have like if you're flat chested
[1842.86 --> 1846.30]  How do you flex a muscle that is like so underdeveloped?
[1846.86 --> 1850.62]  No idea how we don't know see that's exactly it's exactly what i'm talking about
[1850.62 --> 1857.58]  Dude, I in a bodybuilder teach linus how to pose would be kind of sick if you did like bodybuilding poses for the underwear shoots
[1857.82 --> 1859.90]  No, hell. Yeah, dude. I have a limit
[1861.34 --> 1865.74]  I absolutely have a limit. It's surprising, but it does exist. Um, anyway
[1865.74 --> 1872.38]  Yeah, no the reason that I like really wanted to start swimming all the time was uh, it was prompted by that injury that I got on softball night
[1872.38 --> 1875.26]  Mm-hmm because i've had these persistent
[1875.90 --> 1883.90]  Rotator cuff here i've had some persistent shoulder injuries and so I really started doing it just more as like rehab
[1884.38 --> 1889.74]  Yeah, just working on all the different muscles that are so hard to use
[1890.46 --> 1893.02]  Um unless you really know what you're doing in the gym
[1893.66 --> 1896.86]  Or if you're doing a really dynamic activity like swimming
[1896.86 --> 1904.46]  Uh, so I was like, okay, well i'm just gonna i'm just gonna get in the pool and justify the bloody expense and all the work that this stupid thing has been
[1905.02 --> 1905.34]  um
[1906.22 --> 1912.86]  And so I was I was mostly just focused on like doing different strokes like range of motion and like moving around a lot
[1912.86 --> 1916.14]  And you know what it's been it's been better softball night the last softball night
[1916.62 --> 1921.58]  Didn't injure myself felt really good hit a pretty good dinger. I don't think I got a home run, but I got a triple
[1921.58 --> 1928.94]  Um, and yeah, it's yeah, it's been it's been feeling good and then now all of a sudden I have boobies, which is like very weird for me because i've never really
[1930.06 --> 1932.06]  Had them that I can remember
[1932.06 --> 1937.90]  Like I was I was in really good shape in late high school when I was really into martial arts
[1938.38 --> 1943.34]  But I was super lean like I probably weighed even though i'm the same height now
[1943.74 --> 1947.74]  And I actually still fit into my uniform from when I was 16, which is pretty wild
[1948.54 --> 1949.74]  That is kind of wild
[1949.74 --> 1954.62]  But I weighed probably 30 less pounds, but I was lean dense
[1955.34 --> 1957.34]  Yeah, but I in muscle I was
[1959.26 --> 1962.46]  No, but that's the thing is back then I could do 50 consecutive push-ups
[1963.26 --> 1966.14]  Now I couldn't even I could I could probably do 15
[1966.94 --> 1968.22]  Not 50
[1968.22 --> 1972.14]  So I don't really know what's going on if your muscles in your legs it won't help you do push-ups
[1972.70 --> 1975.34]  And you haven't been training your chest you've been training badminton, which is your legs
[1976.46 --> 1978.46]  Yeah, I don't have a fight gap
[1979.74 --> 1982.46]  I
[1986.46 --> 1988.54]  I mean i'm pretty sure you can block that with muscle
[1988.54 --> 1993.82]  That's the other thing too like when I was when I was 16. I was also doing all my lifeguarding training and stuff
[1994.38 --> 1996.38]  Like I I should have been
[1996.38 --> 1999.26]  But you're saying that your pecs are getting stronger from swimming
[1999.42 --> 2004.62]  Yeah, so what i'm saying now is your your current muscle building activity is strengthening your legs mostly
[2005.50 --> 2010.70]  So if you're putting mass in your legs, that's weight that you're pushing up when you're doing a push-up and you're not training your chest ever
[2010.70 --> 2012.70]  I just they're trying to do 50 push-ups
[2013.42 --> 2014.06]  It's gonna be hard
[2014.06 --> 2017.42]  Yeah, I guess I just mean like back then I would have fought but I would have boobies
[2017.42 --> 2020.54]  Without a crazy amount of training you could get back to 50
[2021.50 --> 2024.38]  Um, yeah, it probably wouldn't take me all that long
[2024.38 --> 2029.10]  But it hurts because i'm old and my shoulders are old. I get weird. Yeah, like when I do yeah
[2029.82 --> 2031.90]  Like yeah, I don't remember this
[2031.90 --> 2033.74]  I work that out though. It gets better with time
[2034.22 --> 2037.82]  The next batch of fan art is gonna be epic. Oh my god
[2039.18 --> 2044.94]  You just have like huge chest I had a I had a thing where i've gotten to the point where when I get a chest pump from going to the
[2044.94 --> 2048.78]  Gym and doing chest day the seat belt I I can look down and there's a gap
[2049.34 --> 2054.78]  When the seat belt crosses my chest that was an interesting moment. I was like whoa, all right
[2056.70 --> 2057.98]  I don't know how to feel about that
[2057.98 --> 2065.02]  Theoretically, it's a good thing because it's a it's a muscle chest pump. So like it's just it's just weird
[2065.02 --> 2071.98]  It's a weird moment. All right, uh, what on earth are we supposed to be talking about? Luke do you want to pick a topic? Sure. Um
[2075.50 --> 2077.50]  Let's see here
[2077.98 --> 2084.06]  Nobody's buying copilot plus for the ai despite microsoft and qualcomm's heavy marketing focus on ai features
[2084.22 --> 2089.18]  Most consumers buying copilot plus laptops appear to be buying them for their competitive battery life
[2089.66 --> 2097.42]  Users also don't find these laptops exclusive ai features like co-creator windows studio effects and live captions with translation
[2097.74 --> 2104.30]  Useful on a day-to-day basis further many popular applications like adobe have simply decided
[2104.62 --> 2106.38]  Not to adjust their ai features
[2106.38 --> 2112.30]  So they run locally as the vast majority of pc sold this year will not be able to run those types of things on device
[2112.30 --> 2116.70]  Anyways, so you'd be doing a bunch of development for a very small portion of users
[2118.22 --> 2120.22]  Yep, what what
[2123.18 --> 2124.38]  I uh
[2124.38 --> 2128.62]  AI stuff is interesting. AI stuff is quite powerful. Yes, and it's cool
[2129.50 --> 2133.82]  It's not necessarily beneficial when you just force feed it into every single thing that you make
[2133.82 --> 2138.14]  And the the bigger the bigger issue for me is just that
[2138.78 --> 2141.66]  it's um, it's not integrated
[2142.38 --> 2148.54]  Into most things if if that kind of makes sense like I can I can I can ai
[2149.34 --> 2157.50]  um, you know, uh track separation like some of the demos that uh, that qualcomm is doing around these copilot plus pcs
[2157.50 --> 2161.74]  Is legitimately super cool that track isolation dj thing?
[2162.38 --> 2167.34]  That's awesome pretty wild for whoever is doing their dj work on a laptop
[2168.22 --> 2171.02]  And whoever uses that specific piece of software
[2171.66 --> 2177.26]  And whoever doesn't have access to a cleaner non ai way of
[2177.90 --> 2179.90]  isolating that track
[2179.90 --> 2186.38]  So we're just we're just looking at we're just looking at a very very small subset of users and and and you know what?
[2186.38 --> 2188.38]  I'm going to see that once that is
[2188.38 --> 2193.26]  More broadly supported in applications that people are going to use which is only going to happen once
[2193.82 --> 2197.98]  Every device can support it. I could see that being part of someone's flow
[2198.54 --> 2203.10]  And and like an you know an average users flow and when I say average user, I don't mean everybody
[2203.10 --> 2206.38]  I mean an average user who would need to do that. So let's say i'm a i'm a street performer
[2207.18 --> 2209.02]  Okay, I do I I do
[2209.66 --> 2210.70]  uh
[2210.70 --> 2212.86]  performances of of mainstream music
[2213.26 --> 2213.74]  um
[2213.74 --> 2217.34]  At a train station and I play the guitar track myself
[2217.90 --> 2220.06]  Okay, super cool. I can rip the guitar
[2220.94 --> 2225.26]  In real time essentially out of any track that I want and you know
[2225.98 --> 2229.98]  Infringement aside. Yeah, that's super convenient. Yeah
[2232.14 --> 2235.34]  But until it's broadly supported on hardware
[2235.66 --> 2239.74]  You're not going to get broad software support and until it's broadly supported in software
[2239.74 --> 2245.82]  You're not really going to get any kind of market penetration. So it's a really cool demo right now, but I just don't see it
[2246.22 --> 2248.22]  I don't see it moving the needle
[2249.10 --> 2254.38]  Honestly though the bigger thing for me the reason that I highlighted this topic for the docket in the first place
[2254.38 --> 2260.54]  Was that I just don't see how after qualcomm spent so much time talking about?
[2261.18 --> 2265.90]  What a key point it was for snapdragon acts that they had excellent battery life?
[2266.86 --> 2268.86]  That it was a surprise to them
[2270.14 --> 2272.14]  That was number one
[2273.26 --> 2276.06]  That was the most that was the most important thing. I mean
[2276.06 --> 2279.82]  Everything about this platform that we've looked at
[2280.62 --> 2282.62]  has been
[2282.78 --> 2284.14]  something
[2284.14 --> 2285.66]  But battery life
[2286.78 --> 2289.66]  Okay, the performance is solid except when it's not
[2290.30 --> 2294.54]  But battery life yeah compatibility is a lot better
[2295.42 --> 2296.54]  But it's still spotty
[2297.18 --> 2299.90]  But battery life how does the battery life compared to a mac?
[2301.42 --> 2305.98]  Solid okay, it's gonna say that's the real fight here. It's finally
[2306.06 --> 2308.70]  Good. Yes, does it go to sleep?
[2310.06 --> 2312.06]  Okay, that
[2312.62 --> 2315.42]  Unfortunately, there's no like meaningful way to
[2316.30 --> 2319.58]  Conclusively test and it can be really inconsistent like one that's exactly it
[2320.14 --> 2326.06]  Could and the other one wouldn't so this will be like we'll have to see with saturation and the same laptop might sleep perfectly today
[2326.54 --> 2328.54]  and then on
[2328.78 --> 2331.10]  Saturday I put it in my backpack and on monday
[2331.42 --> 2334.30]  It's a furnace in there and I take it out and the battery's dead and the
[2335.10 --> 2336.62]  I don't know yeah fair enough
[2336.94 --> 2339.34]  Yeah, very very frustrating but
[2340.14 --> 2344.06]  Everything we've talked about with this platform has been like yeah, there's compromises but
[2344.94 --> 2346.62]  the battery life and
[2347.18 --> 2348.14]  I I think that
[2349.34 --> 2350.78]  I think that something that
[2351.58 --> 2352.78]  here hold on a second are we
[2354.22 --> 2356.22]  Oh, man, what's the oh my goodness?
[2356.22 --> 2358.22]  This is really embarrassing
[2358.22 --> 2359.26]  uh, someone made
[2359.98 --> 2361.98]  a video about our um
[2363.66 --> 2366.14]  our snapdragon video
[2366.86 --> 2368.14]  and I forget their name
[2368.94 --> 2369.34]  uh
[2371.34 --> 2372.14]  Okay, anyway
[2372.86 --> 2373.26]  uh
[2375.74 --> 2377.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[2377.34 --> 2381.02]  uh, anyway, the point the point that I was trying to make is that when we were
[2381.02 --> 2391.02]  when we when we talked about the platform for us the battery life was a major major focus because the vast majority of the time that people are using their computers
[2391.02 --> 2392.46]  They're doing something extremely light
[2392.46 --> 2400.06]  And essentially what we want to know is how much of a drain is the processor when you can't turn the screen off
[2400.62 --> 2402.54]  You can't turn the wireless connectivity off
[2403.26 --> 2407.58]  Like how how much is that just having the system powered on?
[2408.38 --> 2412.78]  affected by the idle power consumption of the processor in it
[2412.78 --> 2419.18]  And as it turns out on these devices, it's really really good and everything else is usable enough
[2419.18 --> 2423.34]  I mean, it's not perfect. Um, when we did our game stream
[2424.30 --> 2426.30]  We went through I think it
[2427.26 --> 2431.90]  Is it a somewhere between 30 and 40 games? I think we made it through a lot of games
[2431.90 --> 2436.70]  It's a long stream. It's like three or four hours, uh, but we made it through a lot of games. Oh, no
[2437.58 --> 2438.70]  Heavens, no
[2438.70 --> 2442.70]  Now some we knew weren't gonna work, but there were lots of others that were broken in
[2443.34 --> 2444.78]  creative ways
[2444.78 --> 2447.18]  There was one where uh, spider-man spider-man
[2447.18 --> 2451.82]  Uh, the hair physics were just wild every hair on
[2452.78 --> 2453.90]  only
[2453.90 --> 2460.46]  better modeled characters like main characters was like sticking out and like physicsing around like this like it
[2460.46 --> 2464.62]  It was hilarious. It's kind of um, yeah, that was pretty awesome
[2465.34 --> 2466.86]  um
[2466.86 --> 2470.86]  But you know our perspective on this product was that we understand that it's first gen
[2470.86 --> 2474.30]  We understand what people are buying for buying it for and no
[2474.62 --> 2478.78]  We don't think that people are buying it to uh, you know
[2479.50 --> 2480.54]  Architect
[2480.54 --> 2481.74]  a building whatever
[2481.74 --> 2487.34]  Yeah, we we know we don't think that people are buying it to use specialized applications on it
[2487.34 --> 2491.02]  We think that people are buying it to essentially do most of what they do in a web browser
[2491.34 --> 2493.82]  And get really really great battery life out of it
[2493.82 --> 2499.50]  And in that context, it's a major success and honestly, I think some of the negative discourse
[2499.98 --> 2505.02]  Around the snapdragon x launch has been from qualcomm just over promising
[2505.50 --> 2511.82]  Yeah, they should have just said you know compatibility is still a challenge strong like really headstrong too much
[2511.82 --> 2515.58]  Yeah, and I do understand why they were confident. It's a good product
[2517.58 --> 2524.30]  But just but but just letting other people beat the drum of positivity
[2524.94 --> 2526.94]  Would have been better than doing it themselves
[2527.42 --> 2533.90]  That's I think the big mistake that they made if I could identify one at risk of sounding too positive to apple
[2534.14 --> 2535.42]  um
[2535.42 --> 2540.06]  I think as well, I think people were maybe a little bit more hopeful about this launch because the m series
[2541.10 --> 2541.66]  uh
[2541.66 --> 2544.94]  Like macbooks that launch went so well
[2546.30 --> 2552.78]  It had issues. Yeah, but it was really smooth. It was really smooth, but the expectations are so different
[2553.34 --> 2559.82]  Like what i'm saying is I think that set the expectations higher. Oh, I just mean the expectations of a mac user are so different like
[2560.54 --> 2566.78]  I could do a lot of what I need to do on a mac by never stepping outside of first-party apple software. Yeah
[2567.58 --> 2571.50]  And so that's a really it's a really different ecosystem
[2571.66 --> 2575.18]  And and I use that word in an in a non disparaging way
[2575.74 --> 2581.10]  It's a very different ecosystem than what exists on windows where you've got all these
[2581.74 --> 2582.78]  disparate
[2582.78 --> 2583.50]  developers
[2583.50 --> 2591.34]  And you've got all these kind of eras during which their applications were created all these expectations of support across different hardware it's
[2591.90 --> 2598.06]  It's a real challenge. Honestly, the fact maybe that's part of it too for me is the fact that it's as good as it is
[2600.06 --> 2605.18]  I'm just really impressed right because I I I I didn't I didn't hope
[2605.98 --> 2608.06]  That windows on arm would ever
[2608.70 --> 2610.30]  gain traction
[2610.30 --> 2612.46]  But it's very clear that it's happening now
[2613.10 --> 2617.02]  I'm still holding out hope that that framework uh risk
[2617.66 --> 2619.58]  processor laptop is going to be sick
[2621.82 --> 2623.82]  um
[2623.82 --> 2635.66]  We've got a really long topic kind of on the on the the the call out on our snapdragon x elite video
[2636.06 --> 2638.78]  And honestly, i'm kind of looking at a lot of it going like
[2639.74 --> 2643.58]  I don't think we need to delve into this. We read the comment. Yeah, there's um
[2643.82 --> 2646.46]  Yeah, there we we published a full response
[2646.78 --> 2652.46]  Um on the video which has been posted on a couple of subreddits including our own you guys can go check it out there
[2652.46 --> 2656.38]  Um, but there there is some discussion here, you know
[2656.38 --> 2660.46]  There's some of the discussion is like how much testing is enough to come to a conclusion
[2661.26 --> 2661.66]  um
[2661.66 --> 2664.62]  You know, I wanted to include more in the video
[2665.18 --> 2670.54]  But the reason that we didn't include more was because the methodology wouldn't have been up to our standards
[2671.18 --> 2678.06]  Um, there were things that we tested that we didn't include because they weren't repeatable enough and it's a brand new platform and that comes with challenges
[2678.06 --> 2684.94]  Um, so the the discussion question here is like should we should we include janky testing in our review videos?
[2685.10 --> 2686.46]  If we disclaim them as such
[2687.02 --> 2691.26]  Like one of the things that I was upset about when I arrived on set because this was a rare video
[2691.82 --> 2696.86]  That because of other obligations was mostly worked on by other members of the team
[2697.50 --> 2698.30]  um
[2698.38 --> 2699.90]  usually i'm pretty
[2700.46 --> 2707.50]  Deeply involved, uh, but on this one I arrived on set after having had conversations about how we were going to do it
[2707.50 --> 2712.06]  And I discovered that we hadn't followed through on any kind of thermal testing
[2712.62 --> 2717.58]  And the answer that was given to me was well, we don't have reliable diode data
[2717.98 --> 2719.10]  and I kind of went well
[2719.98 --> 2722.06]  What I would have liked to see is at least
[2722.62 --> 2725.02]  You know a thermal camera pointed at a tape strip
[2725.90 --> 2729.42]  Across you know two price comparable performance comparable
[2729.90 --> 2732.06]  notebooks from qualcomm and intel or amd
[2732.94 --> 2734.38]  Where we kind of look at
[2735.02 --> 2737.18]  You know surface temperature like is
[2738.62 --> 2744.46]  Make it meaningful to me the user even if we can't draw a conclusion about exactly what the thermal draw is
[2745.18 --> 2748.14]  Excuse me what the power draw is and therefore the thermal output
[2748.62 --> 2753.42]  Um, and that was something that you know there was some debate about by then it was it was sort of you know
[2753.42 --> 2755.50]  too late to do much more than you know just uh
[2756.62 --> 2756.94]  um
[2756.94 --> 2766.38]  I mention if anything but you know that's something that you know maybe we need to philosophically re-examine like are we willing to do
[2767.02 --> 2769.02]  kind of um
[2770.06 --> 2775.74]  Janky janky tests as long as we say like look this is this is what they are and I
[2776.30 --> 2778.30]  I see it both ways
[2778.30 --> 2784.14]  Like going back to the roots of ltt. I don't know if you remember this video. I'm pretty sure we worked on it together
[2784.86 --> 2787.98]  Um, but there was this uh screen protector
[2788.62 --> 2791.90]  Film like uh like a like a paint on screen protector
[2792.54 --> 2797.82]  That claimed to create like a nano coating over the glass that made it scratch proof
[2798.06 --> 2801.50]  Even though you painted it on and the test that we came up with
[2801.98 --> 2804.22]  Um, was it like dragging it behind your bike?
[2804.38 --> 2805.74]  Yeah, I dragged it down the street
[2806.54 --> 2810.22]  With the screen facing down on the phone uh behind my motorcycle
[2810.22 --> 2813.58]  I'm pretty sure i'm running after you with a camera or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[2814.30 --> 2817.74]  Um, and you know what that's not scientific at all
[2819.66 --> 2823.26]  But what was cool was we were able to pick it up and kind of scratch at the thing and go oh, yeah
[2823.26 --> 2826.30]  There is a coating on here even though we couldn't see it and and you know, it's something
[2827.18 --> 2833.50]  But we've also kind of evolved beyond that and I can see the argument the other way that if we can't stand behind it
[2833.50 --> 2835.50]  Especially in light of how
[2836.94 --> 2838.94]  How much scrutiny?
[2839.18 --> 2843.82]  There has been on us if we can't stand behind it 100% are we better off saying nothing?
[2844.30 --> 2847.34]  But then we don't say anything and we get attacked for
[2848.06 --> 2850.54]  Hiding things and it's just like what are you even talking about?
[2850.54 --> 2854.78]  I think you just need to make it clear what the like level of confidence is basically
[2855.26 --> 2858.22]  Um, yeah, except that the top upvoted comment
[2858.22 --> 2863.74]  Comment on the discussion around this is that our graphs are already unintelligible to the average person
[2865.02 --> 2871.02]  Our crafts are just bar graphs if we start adding error bars like that's that bad. That's no they're not
[2871.02 --> 2873.42]  That's the thing that very scientific minded people
[2874.14 --> 2880.30]  Don't realize sometimes I think is if you start asking for you know confidence intervals. Okay, to be clear
[2880.30 --> 2883.34]  I think in order to do that it would have to appear very differently
[2883.34 --> 2886.54]  I don't think it would have to be a label on a graph. I think you would you would have to like
[2887.42 --> 2889.42]  present the information
[2889.66 --> 2894.22]  Not even on a graph necessarily to like communicate without words even
[2894.70 --> 2898.70]  But you should probably also do it with words that this is not to the same level of
[2899.58 --> 2909.02]  Okay, but then how much of our video which and like look I don't want to start publishing 60 minute video essays about the merits of some stupid processor
[2909.10 --> 2910.94]  You're the one that wanted the lab like we
[2910.94 --> 2917.26]  It's it's really interesting to me to see the way my words get twisted against me like we we strive to be entertaining
[2917.98 --> 2921.66]  That doesn't mean that doesn't mean that we're an entertainment channel
[2921.66 --> 2927.26]  We're still a tech channel where a lot of people have unironically learned a lot about technology
[2927.82 --> 2933.18]  Um, but that doesn't mean that i'm going to compromise on making content. That's good. I don't know you're talking about
[2933.18 --> 2934.78]  I'm entertained because to me
[2934.78 --> 2940.94]  Meaning it's an entertainment channel for anything to be good. It has to be at least digestible
[2940.94 --> 2944.22]  It has to be over a certain bar of entertainment value
[2944.78 --> 2950.62]  Um, and so you know no, I don't want to spend three minutes on disclaimers luke
[2950.62 --> 2956.86]  Sorry run john in full plane chat just said do the graph in crayon and I actually love it
[2963.34 --> 2964.78]  It communicates pretty well
[2965.50 --> 2970.94]  But you could still you could even like do it digitally so that it's like fairly clean crayon
[2970.94 --> 2974.86]  But still make it obvious like this is it's supposed to look like a piece of paper with crayon drone on it
[2974.86 --> 2976.86]  um
[2979.50 --> 2985.74]  Sorry, you're like all eloquently talking about trying to communicate with an audience and the perception of the channel and stuff and i'm
[2986.54 --> 2988.54]  Crayons
[2991.10 --> 2993.10]  I just I don't know yeah
[2993.58 --> 2997.98]  Yeah, I don't know. Sifrin said the latest amd video is one of the better videos i've seen
[2998.06 --> 3001.74]  I think I may have aged out of a lot of the videos now still enjoy wan show though
[3001.74 --> 3005.26]  Um, nice, you know, yeah, i'm i'm glad you do
[3005.74 --> 3010.22]  Um, honestly that amd video is not the kind of thing that I want to make though
[3010.70 --> 3015.98]  This this ryzen video the most recent one like I i am i'm tired of being
[3016.86 --> 3018.14]  angry
[3018.14 --> 3020.14]  yeah
[3020.14 --> 3026.46]  Like maybe maybe in future we don't make that video. I would like to i'd like to find a brighter side
[3026.46 --> 3028.94]  I'd like to you know what I want to finally do
[3028.94 --> 3032.94]  Little tech shop of horrors
[3034.14 --> 3036.06]  We've talked about this a lot of times
[3037.26 --> 3041.02]  Why don't we like actually open an it shop?
[3044.22 --> 3045.82]  Just just do it
[3046.62 --> 3051.90]  People are gonna troll you so hard make videos might be worth it might be good for content, but people are gonna troll you so hard
[3052.70 --> 3054.06]  um
[3054.14 --> 3058.22]  I think that we'd probably compete with what's his name?
[3058.86 --> 3061.34]  Uh, keith from uh from black uh black lab
[3061.98 --> 3063.58]  This guy charged me so much money
[3064.54 --> 3067.26]  You could open how much that stuff do you still have left? Do you have any of it left?
[3067.26 --> 3069.26]  We still have all of it. Just put it in
[3069.26 --> 3075.74]  You have a storefront already
[3078.22 --> 3083.90]  You don't even have to buy the convincingly dusty old junk you have the convincingly dusty old junk
[3083.90 --> 3084.22]  Oh my god
[3084.78 --> 3087.58]  There you go. There's your legitimacy. I don't know man like I just
[3088.14 --> 3088.78]  I uh
[3088.78 --> 3092.70]  I want to reconnect with you know excitement
[3093.34 --> 3094.06]  And fun
[3094.62 --> 3099.98]  And like i'm just i'm tired of being i'm tired of being mad and cranky about
[3100.70 --> 3105.90]  You know this branding or that that fps that's six percent lower
[3105.98 --> 3112.14]  I'm just it's so boring to me personally. I find it incredibly exhausting any new thing that I get interested in
[3112.22 --> 3117.74]  I go to try to find the you know the internet community around this thing because i'm like looking for more information or whatever and they're always just
[3118.22 --> 3123.26]  Every single time it's just hatred and anger and i'm just like all right. I don't want to be here anymore
[3123.58 --> 3124.22]  this sucks
[3124.22 --> 3124.46]  I
[3124.46 --> 3127.50]  I talked about this in writers meeting today and just like
[3128.70 --> 3130.70]  All right, I didn't talk about this specific part today
[3130.70 --> 3133.82]  But i've talked to the writers about this about just wanting to be
[3134.46 --> 3139.26]  an oasis of of positivity and optimism and we're not going to be dishonest
[3139.58 --> 3142.22]  Obviously if something's bad then we're going to say it's bad
[3142.22 --> 3144.22]  If you're reviewing something you got to be legit about it
[3144.22 --> 3150.54]  But I guess what i'm trying to say is I want to be more selective about what we cover and I want to cover things that I think are cool
[3151.10 --> 3151.58]  Yeah
[3152.62 --> 3153.02]  Nice
[3153.66 --> 3154.78]  Yeah, I think that'd be neat
[3155.34 --> 3155.74]  Yeah
[3155.74 --> 3157.18]  You got to be negative sometimes
[3157.82 --> 3159.98]  Because like you said you can't be dishonest about things
[3160.62 --> 3161.10]  but uh
[3163.02 --> 3165.02]  I don't know I find it exhausting
[3165.42 --> 3165.82]  um
[3165.82 --> 3173.58]  Hate gets views people just the the whole doom-scrirling nature of just like you go on the internet to get mad and stay mad
[3173.58 --> 3174.06]  It's just like
[3174.06 --> 3174.78]  I also
[3174.78 --> 3179.34]  I also think that that that cynicism is part of no no offense
[3179.74 --> 3182.38]  um to whoever said they had outgrown our videos
[3182.38 --> 3186.62]  I I think that cynicism is part of why you might feel that way
[3186.62 --> 3191.34]  Like I one of my problems is I don't really I don't watch our stuff
[3191.34 --> 3194.38]  I think it makes it hard to I think it makes it hard to enjoy
[3195.02 --> 3199.66]  Anything do you feel like that negativity is a is a theme on the channel right now?
[3199.66 --> 3204.78]  I I don't watch I don't know no, but that's exactly it and I think that it's easy to
[3204.78 --> 3207.10]  But then is this real is this really a change then?
[3208.22 --> 3210.70]  um, I think that I think that
[3210.70 --> 3216.22]  I think that we can do more
[3217.18 --> 3222.94]  I guess is what i'm trying to say because even the things that you look at like what we've done over the last little bit like this
[3223.50 --> 3226.30]  This we did because we felt it was really important
[3226.78 --> 3227.74]  um, amd
[3228.30 --> 3235.82]  Bucked a trend that has existed basically forever where the first number indicates the generation of the product
[3236.78 --> 3239.26]  That to me is unacceptable. Do you know about this?
[3239.26 --> 3240.78]  Wait, what no?
[3241.02 --> 3249.26]  So their mobile chips will no longer use the first number to indicate how new the product is that it will be the fourth number now
[3251.10 --> 3254.70]  Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah. Yeah, that's worth making a video about that makes sense
[3254.70 --> 3256.70]  Yeah, still gotta do that kind of stuff sometimes
[3256.70 --> 3262.06]  Yeah, but then this is just working with the kids to fix the gaming minivan
[3262.22 --> 3264.78]  This is checking out an ancient keyboard that
[3264.78 --> 3270.46]  Uh, we found a picture from the chernobyl disaster that had this exact keyboard in it
[3270.70 --> 3276.46]  And so ariel from the lab like a boy got it working again like he did with that weird soviet mouse
[3277.26 --> 3278.62]  um
[3278.62 --> 3281.02]  This is something maybe we just shouldn't have covered
[3281.98 --> 3282.94]  so
[3282.94 --> 3288.62]  It's uh, it gets pretty deep into the weeds on what a dual mode monitor is
[3288.62 --> 3289.90]  And
[3290.38 --> 3296.62]  Maybe we should just leave that for someone else to explain because to me it's not that exciting
[3297.02 --> 3300.22]  I think that most people probably don't need it. Do you know what it is?
[3300.22 --> 3302.22]  It's basically a monitor with two edids
[3302.78 --> 3308.30]  Okay, and the reason for that is that um, essentially as far as we can tell
[3308.30 --> 3309.34]  um
[3310.46 --> 3312.54]  No scaler can handle
[3313.18 --> 3314.14]  um
[3314.14 --> 3317.10]  480 hertz refreshes at 4k
[3317.74 --> 3322.54]  Even at the panel level because like obviously no no input can handle that anyway
[3322.94 --> 3326.30]  So at the panel level they can't do it. So it has to run in two different modes
[3326.30 --> 3334.14]  It has to run in a 480 hertz 1080p mode or a 240 hertz 4k mode in order for both of them to work natively
[3334.14 --> 3341.66]  Essentially and like yeah, maybe that just maybe that just isn't 11 minutes and 46 seconds worth of interesting and we just shouldn't have bothered
[3342.62 --> 3344.62]  um
[3346.78 --> 3352.70]  Like this was fun just building the ceo computer with that like wild sinister case. This was really fun
[3353.42 --> 3356.78]  Uh checking out this hard drive with 25 million computer viruses on it
[3358.38 --> 3363.90]  I the why did you make me build this computer in that thumbnail looks like one of the toys from toy story
[3363.90 --> 3366.38]  That was like a ripped apart and put together
[3369.82 --> 3372.54]  I don't know why it made me think of that but yeah, I don't know. I think
[3373.58 --> 3375.98]  Trying to bring positivity
[3376.94 --> 3381.34]  When you can is a nice thing to do on the internet because it's just
[3382.14 --> 3388.78]  Yeah, see this is tough like unique username says that whole amd video is the least interesting thing you uploaded on the main channel in recent
[3388.78 --> 3391.74]  Months marketing is bs always has been always will so what?
[3393.34 --> 3396.38]  Well, it's like awareness of a bad practice though. I
[3396.70 --> 3399.42]  I respect making that video like I even if it doesn't perform that well
[3400.94 --> 3405.98]  I mean, yeah, fine, but then so if nobody says that right like isn't that my job?
[3406.70 --> 3409.02]  What is my job then tell me?
[3409.02 --> 3415.02]  On like a very technical level, it's just like get more views
[3415.02 --> 3418.38]  But I don't think we've ever seen it that way and that's why you've always resisted vc funding
[3418.86 --> 3423.50]  Um, so that you can keep dictating what you do and I think what you would probably say you do is like
[3424.38 --> 3429.50]  Entertaining education about computers and computer hardware and electronics igniting sparks
[3429.50 --> 3433.26]  Yeah, the way that I like to is the way that I like to sort of
[3433.90 --> 3434.94]  um, characterize it
[3434.94 --> 3439.10]  It's always fun when you go to like a show or convention or something and you're you're meeting
[3439.66 --> 3443.50]  Audience members and they tell you about how like you inspired them or your channel
[3443.98 --> 3446.70]  A lot of people tell me that the channel did i'm like, yeah, cool. That makes sense
[3447.10 --> 3449.66]  um to like go to school for
[3450.62 --> 3452.62]  Computer engineering software engineering whatever else
[3452.62 --> 3458.14]  It's like, oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah, it was pretty cool meeting and munition and here being like, yeah, you like taught me how to build a computer
[3458.14 --> 3461.66]  I was like, yeah, like that's sick. That's super cool. That stuff super cool
[3462.62 --> 3463.66]  um
[3463.66 --> 3471.02]  Be passionate about your interests and bring us along. I mean, yeah, maybe that's uh, maybe that's a mission statement for the channel from run jun over on float
[3471.02 --> 3478.62]  Like that. That's good. Good job run jun. Yeah, like and you know what we've we've sidetracked some of the stuff that i'm really passionate about because
[3479.74 --> 3483.98]  Various reasons it's a lot of work or we're not sure how many people are interested, but like
[3484.78 --> 3488.70]  Maybe I should just say you know what forget it. We're making a video about
[3489.26 --> 3493.74]  Stereoscopic 3d projection in 2024. You've always been on the 3d stuff
[3494.54 --> 3495.74]  Look
[3495.74 --> 3497.74]  Okay, look
[3498.22 --> 3500.22]  Stop
[3500.78 --> 3507.18]  You carrying you carrying that much though in my opinion is a pretty good reason to do it. I think here's why it's cool
[3508.22 --> 3510.22]  Stop
[3510.22 --> 3512.22]  What a f**king ass
[3512.22 --> 3514.22]  That would be a good boy
[3516.78 --> 3517.82]  Here's why it's cool
[3519.26 --> 3520.62]  Okay
[3520.62 --> 3522.86]  3d blu-rays still get released
[3523.74 --> 3525.34]  For the yes
[3525.42 --> 3526.86]  Yes, they do
[3526.86 --> 3527.58]  What?
[3527.58 --> 3531.10]  Yes, you can get like despicable me at least three
[3531.58 --> 3534.38]  Uh, hold on. Let's see despicable me for
[3534.94 --> 3542.54]  3d or wait, is that one not out yet? Yeah, so you can get you can get the most recent despicable me
[3543.18 --> 3549.18]  In 3d despicable me four is probably coming in 3d according to this post on forum.bluera.com
[3549.18 --> 3553.74]  3d from like seven years ago, okay, okay hold on
[3554.54 --> 3554.70]  Okay
[3554.70 --> 3557.50]  Uh blue
[3558.30 --> 3561.74]  Tynan said in flow plane chat if the host is interested people are way more likely to be interested
[3562.22 --> 3567.18]  Um, if you are interested in talking to somebody about it, it's highly likely they'll become interested
[3567.18 --> 3572.46]  I do generally agree with that one of the problems is getting people to click on it at all
[3572.46 --> 3576.30]  Um, okay, new blu-ray 3d releases
[3577.02 --> 3582.22]  This year a creature from the black lagoon 3d came out in march of 2024
[3582.86 --> 3583.10]  Okay
[3584.46 --> 3591.50]  3d blu-rays are still coming so there has to be some type of a market because technically some of them are being released. Yes
[3592.06 --> 3596.14]  Um, nice. Okay, so that's that's something okay
[3597.42 --> 3599.42]  number two
[3599.82 --> 3604.54]  Last year so not ces of this year but ces of the previous year
[3604.86 --> 3609.10]  We made a video that got buried because of some dispute between
[3609.58 --> 3614.54]  Asus and nvidia over what could or couldn't be disclosed about the laptop
[3614.94 --> 3616.94]  Let me just put it this way. Oh, so it uh
[3617.90 --> 3622.62]  Yeah, anyway, the laptop had a stereoscopic 3d screen on it. It was super super cool
[3622.94 --> 3628.38]  It was it was the first justification that i've ever seen of a 4k screen on a laptop
[3628.38 --> 3630.78]  It used eye tracking to
[3632.86 --> 3637.18]  Change the perspective of every other eye so that every other line
[3637.98 --> 3643.18]  Was going to the right and every other line was going to the left and it was glasses free 3d
[3644.14 --> 3648.22]  And it could like steer so you could move your head around and it wouldn't break the 3d effect
[3648.22 --> 3649.82]  It was really incredible
[3650.46 --> 3656.70]  Anyway, one of the demos that they were showing was like a middleware of some sort like some some app that you can run
[3657.18 --> 3660.62]  That converts non stereo 3d games to 3d
[3661.26 --> 3661.82]  and so
[3662.78 --> 3664.78]  what if
[3664.78 --> 3666.78]  You could build like a king tier
[3667.34 --> 3669.02]  stereo 3d gaming setup
[3669.90 --> 3671.90]  in 2024
[3671.90 --> 3676.46]  Okay, all right. Well, you know what whatever i'm doing it
[3677.18 --> 3678.62]  Yeah, do it i'm doing it
[3679.34 --> 3684.46]  I can already tell you sourcing a 3d compatible screen not easy these days
[3685.34 --> 3687.34]  Sourcing the polarizing filters
[3688.14 --> 3695.82]  Not easy these days getting a 3d compatible projector is pretty doable because pretty much any dlp will work pretty well
[3695.82 --> 3702.94]  Unfortunately, not my epson ls 12 000. I have already tested it and this is going to be at least a two-part series darn it because
[3704.38 --> 3709.82]  So, I know I know aj's in the chat. I know today aj we talked about many many many many things that we need to do
[3709.82 --> 3712.94]  But at the top of that list, I think you need to make it so that
[3713.66 --> 3718.46]  Flowplane live streaming is 3d compatible so that we can see how much we can make that cost
[3719.58 --> 3720.62]  Okay
[3720.62 --> 3722.62]  And reason number three
[3723.10 --> 3727.18]  Is that with vr headsets becoming somewhat mainstream ish
[3728.14 --> 3735.26]  I believe there's going to be a 3d content resurgence 3d content resurgence with iphones being capable of recording
[3736.70 --> 3743.02]  Three I mean, excuse me spatial video. I think there's actually going to be a lot of content to watch
[3743.90 --> 3745.90]  there
[3745.90 --> 3747.90]  Got him
[3747.90 --> 3751.98]  I didn't really get him because he's not convinced but no, it'll be cool. It'll be cool
[3752.54 --> 3754.70]  And I don't think I don't think we're gonna
[3755.26 --> 3757.26]  have like some form of like a
[3757.26 --> 3761.98]  uh, a time budget for like just passion project content every once in a while
[3761.98 --> 3763.82]  I just think it should just all be passion project
[3764.30 --> 3767.10]  Let's just do away with the stuff that's like boring. Yeah
[3767.82 --> 3770.30]  And so you know what this is going to manifest as
[3771.26 --> 3774.54]  If a new cpu comes out and we don't care
[3774.54 --> 3777.42]  We're just not going to cover it
[3778.78 --> 3781.50]  Yeah, which is going to be I think a bit of an adjustment
[3782.06 --> 3789.42]  Uh, and we've already kind of done it if you think about it. It wasn't really on purpose. I think you started with gpus. Yeah intel's 14th gen. Oh
[3790.78 --> 3791.98]  We just
[3791.98 --> 3792.86]  Yeah
[3792.86 --> 3795.58]  Didn't yeah, we did a bunch of testing on it and
[3796.22 --> 3800.86]  In the long term we would love for the labs website to have charts and everything so you can like
[3801.74 --> 3804.38]  know how it performs or whatever um
[3805.10 --> 3806.94]  but it was pretty obviously just
[3807.98 --> 3814.62]  uh 13th gen in 14th clothing and we so we did a bunch of testing on it and then it turned out that
[3815.66 --> 3817.50]  there was some kind of like
[3817.50 --> 3822.94]  microcode update or or the bios we were using on the on the particular board we used anyway
[3822.94 --> 3827.58]  We had to like retest so then we did that but then it was past the embargo and then we were like
[3827.58 --> 3830.22]  Do we even want to bother with this and while we were humming and hawing?
[3830.78 --> 3831.42]  Um
[3831.58 --> 3839.50]  We had the new data and then intel released like some software utility that like core steers and and improves gaming performance or something
[3839.98 --> 3846.86]  Which was exclusive to that generation and was not going to go to 13th gen even though there was no architectural reason why they couldn't
[3847.10 --> 3848.54]  And then that came out and we were like, okay
[3848.54 --> 3852.30]  So we're gonna have to test this a third time for some boring video that no one cares about
[3852.30 --> 3859.34]  And then and then a little while later they made that application available to past gen processors in their own lineup
[3859.34 --> 3861.50]  So we would have to like go and retest those and we were sitting here going
[3863.26 --> 3864.70]  Does anyone?
[3864.70 --> 3866.70]  forget it like
[3867.26 --> 3868.70]  Yeah, forget it
[3868.94 --> 3873.66]  So yeah, I think I think just a chart on a website is going to be the answer in the longer term
[3873.66 --> 3878.38]  And you'll still see them appear in videos. We needed the best cpu at you know
[3878.38 --> 3880.86]  300 watts so
[3881.66 --> 3885.66]  Or get whatever or for like this game or this application for this particular game
[3885.66 --> 3891.58]  And so that's why we're building a computer into a van again and the little man likes to play this particular game
[3891.58 --> 3893.58]  So this station needs to be good at this. Yeah
[3894.22 --> 3897.50]  That sort of thing. So you'll you'll still see it make its way into the content
[3897.50 --> 3901.66]  But I think that we're just gonna we're gonna stay focused on on what we actually want to do like
[3902.06 --> 3904.86]  Okay, I want to do a convection cooled computer
[3904.86 --> 3909.10]  Cool. Yeah for the theater room. I'd click on that immediately. Yeah
[3909.66 --> 3917.58]  Sick, so why am I not why are we spending a bunch of like, you know, justin's time doing something no one cares about when instead
[3918.14 --> 3924.14]  We can like take that idea that someone had on reddit of like cooling a gpu with like a giant copper chunk
[3924.14 --> 3925.58]  Which by the way isn't gonna work?
[3925.58 --> 3926.14]  um
[3926.78 --> 3934.94]  But like make a cooler for a gpu that like is like this wide and just takes passive airflow and just
[3935.50 --> 3939.74]  Convection cools it that'd be way better. Yeah. Yeah, sweet. Yeah
[3941.18 --> 3941.50]  yeah
[3942.30 --> 3944.06]  Speaking of the lab man
[3944.86 --> 3945.74]  It is
[3945.74 --> 3950.94]  Pretty exciting to see it finally starting to come into its own there was uh, there was a reddit thread just
[3950.94 --> 3953.34]  Appreciating the lab
[3953.90 --> 3954.38]  Um
[3955.58 --> 3962.38]  And the thing is that not everyone is going to agree with every methodology, which is why we have always said guys always said
[3962.62 --> 3964.62]  That you want multiple perspectives
[3964.70 --> 3969.10]  Some people are going to look at our 720p youtube endurance test and they're going to go
[3970.14 --> 3974.06]  Well, that's not representative. It's like well, yeah, it's representative of what we want to know
[3974.06 --> 3981.66]  Which is in a best case scenario, which is functionally like idling but you can't turn off any radios you can't turn off the screen
[3981.74 --> 3983.02]  Everything's in motion
[3983.02 --> 3987.74]  Uh, we what is the absolute longest that something could last that's that's what we want to know
[3987.98 --> 3989.50]  So for what we want to know that's a good test
[3989.50 --> 3996.22]  But someone else might want to know something else which is why multiple perspectives are so important and why it's not just
[3997.74 --> 3999.74]  One single truth
[3999.74 --> 4005.82]  Especially never can be as varied and complicated as a laptop exactly so many different reasons why someone might care
[4005.90 --> 4007.90]  So this was a really cool thread to see from
[4008.78 --> 4011.74]  Disaster 84 labs is pretty great
[4012.30 --> 4015.50]  um, so they finally finally made their way over to the page
[4016.06 --> 4016.54]  um
[4017.82 --> 4021.34]  And you know, I was looking at it going I feel
[4022.14 --> 4026.38]  Exactly the same way it is super cool to see content starting to
[4026.38 --> 4028.38]  regularly
[4028.78 --> 4033.50]  Appear on the site not because millions of people are reading every one of these
[4033.90 --> 4036.94]  But because people are getting really important information
[4037.18 --> 4040.94]  We still haven't even technically like full launch the site this power supply
[4041.58 --> 4042.38]  um
[4042.38 --> 4044.38]  the power supplies that we're testing
[4044.70 --> 4045.74]  are
[4045.74 --> 4052.30]  Alternating so you'll actually notice there's a pattern every other one is from like a like a major brand
[4053.02 --> 4059.34]  And every other one is from a brand that or our model that appears to be selling very well
[4059.58 --> 4065.82]  Based on the external data that we can glean from marketplace websites like amazon and new egg and wherever else
[4066.54 --> 4069.10]  So that's why you're seeing half of them be kind of
[4069.82 --> 4071.10]  random
[4071.10 --> 4073.10]  We have already
[4073.18 --> 4078.38]  Found three power supplies that failed our testing outright across two different samples
[4079.26 --> 4082.14]  So this sama one is another example
[4082.62 --> 4083.66]  um
[4083.66 --> 4088.62]  People are spending a hundred dollars on this power supply on new egg and amazon
[4089.26 --> 4090.70]  both of them
[4090.70 --> 4094.78]  Both of our units failed during our 20 degree celsius ocp test
[4095.82 --> 4100.06]  If you're over current protection isn't working, that's a big problem
[4100.38 --> 4106.70]  And so seeing the labs already starting to bring this information to people is so exciting to me
[4106.70 --> 4110.38]  Can you go back to that sama power supply? Yeah
[4111.42 --> 4115.74]  I was sitting here just rather surprised. I don't do product reviewing stuff anymore, so I don't know but
[4117.26 --> 4122.46]  I saw all the text under the bad and my eye sucks. I couldn't read it, but you were saying um
[4123.42 --> 4124.38]  It failed. Yeah
[4125.58 --> 4129.50]  I thought this was a see sonic powers, but look at the logo. I know right
[4130.70 --> 4135.10]  You said sama and I was like what yeah, it makes more sense to me when you said that
[4135.10 --> 4138.30]  Look at this sketchy 80 plus platinum looking
[4138.94 --> 4141.18]  10 year warranty 10 year warranty
[4141.74 --> 4144.54]  Yeah, so they kind of make it look like yeah, right
[4145.58 --> 4153.10]  They make it look like a see sonic platinum the logos are like identical but reversed. Yeah, that's that's rough man ridiculous
[4153.50 --> 4156.70]  Yeah, I don't even think it's reversed. Casper explorer goes
[4158.06 --> 4161.10]  Apparently it says platinum 10 plus yeah, whatever that means
[4161.10 --> 4165.26]  What oh no 10 year? Oh, I don't no no no no, I don't know
[4167.02 --> 4169.58]  Let me see that's rough though. Yeah here here here here here
[4170.14 --> 4175.58]  So they put up they put like a platinum looking thing 10 year warranty next to the 80 plus gold. Yeah
[4175.58 --> 4177.42]  Yeah, yeah
[4177.50 --> 4178.94]  Anyway, um
[4179.02 --> 4181.42]  Yeah, casper explorer says I thought sama was good
[4182.30 --> 4184.30]  Well
[4185.18 --> 4191.82]  Uh, that's the point that's the point of the lab. That's the answer to why we're spending all this time building this thing
[4192.06 --> 4193.74]  I don't like that. So we're gonna
[4194.54 --> 4198.14]  We're gonna we're gonna keep doing it, but I think I want ltt to be
[4198.78 --> 4199.82]  fun
[4199.82 --> 4201.82]  And you can get the bad news in a
[4202.46 --> 4205.98]  in a manageable bite-sized way that doesn't have to be what you like
[4206.78 --> 4208.38]  sit down on the couch and
[4209.66 --> 4211.34]  Relax to watch you know, yeah
[4211.34 --> 4217.82]  Yeah, oh we're supposed to do some merch messages. Oh man, we've got
[4218.46 --> 4223.42]  We've got some exciting stuff to tell you guys about store wise. Oh, I see some of you found it
[4223.98 --> 4226.14]  Oh, yeah, been some merch messages today
[4226.78 --> 4229.90]  Neat uh, wan show wan show exclusive
[4230.78 --> 4232.78]  Lime day is coming
[4232.78 --> 4236.06]  Uh, you guys are gonna want to sign up on the store go do it now
[4236.06 --> 4241.02]  Uh up to 60% off select items every day july 16th to 19th
[4241.18 --> 4243.26]  So that's coming next week guys
[4243.82 --> 4248.94]  Sign up so you can get first dibs because a lot of these deals are going to be extremely limited quantities
[4249.18 --> 4251.42]  And based on how many people are on the newsletter already
[4251.98 --> 4256.14]  They're gonna sell really really fast. So make sure you're on it anyway
[4256.14 --> 4258.30]  We're previewing one of our lime day deals
[4258.78 --> 4260.14]  You can see it in our favorites
[4260.14 --> 4265.74]  It's exclusive during the broadcast and maybe shortly afterward for early vaude viewers
[4266.06 --> 4274.22]  But we're doing a screwdriver bundle where you can get the full-sized black screwdriver and the full-sized and the stubby sized black screwdriver
[4274.54 --> 4276.54]  I don't believe we have ever
[4276.70 --> 4279.10]  uh discounted these models before like this
[4280.06 --> 4284.62]  For 30 dollars off so you can go ahead and add that to cart and leave a merch message
[4284.62 --> 4288.54]  The way merch messages work and they are the way to interact with the wan show
[4288.54 --> 4291.34]  We don't do super chats or twitch bits or anything like that
[4291.74 --> 4295.18]  You just add an item to your cart and you'll see a little box in your cart when we're live
[4295.18 --> 4298.46]  And you can leave a merch message which will pop up down here
[4298.46 --> 4301.10]  Or it'll go to producer dan who will reply to it
[4301.50 --> 4307.42]  Or forward it to someone internally who can answer your question or it'll go to me and luke to talk about dan
[4307.42 --> 4310.38]  Do you want to show these fine folks how merch messages work?
[4310.38 --> 4311.98]  Sure, absolutely. Let's see
[4312.70 --> 4317.74]  Dear Monsieur C. Bastien and Large Friendly Bear and Bus Bar
[4318.46 --> 4325.42]  Uh, sure. Any plans for a water bottle lid with a relief valve so that we can chug with abandon without water spilling it on our face?
[4325.42 --> 4325.98]  Not yet
[4329.66 --> 4336.46]  Let's see. Hey DLL I started watching your ancient live streams, archives, and the very first wan show
[4336.46 --> 4344.06]  Linus said that sound cards are a must compared to motherboards onboard audio. Is this true for modern motherboards?
[4344.06 --> 4344.54]  No
[4344.54 --> 4345.50]  Nope
[4345.50 --> 4350.78]  Are those the shortest two consecutive merch message answers ever?
[4350.78 --> 4352.38]  I feel like we owe him another one
[4352.38 --> 4353.18]  I have never
[4353.74 --> 4355.18]  I never know which way it's gonna go
[4355.18 --> 4355.98]  It's either gonna be
[4355.98 --> 4356.38]  I
[4356.38 --> 4360.30]  I've given you some that I think you're gonna say no to and then you talk for 20 minutes
[4360.30 --> 4364.62]  And then some other ones which I think are gonna be bangers and then no
[4366.38 --> 4367.58]  I'll tell you what dan
[4367.58 --> 4368.14]  Yeah
[4368.14 --> 4369.98]  Why don't you answer that last one?
[4369.98 --> 4371.98]  Is a sound card a must?
[4372.94 --> 4373.18]  No
[4374.30 --> 4375.10]  Doesn't?
[4375.10 --> 4376.14]  Alrighty then see you later
[4377.98 --> 4379.18]  Choose your airpods
[4379.18 --> 4381.26]  All I'll say about it is that I miss
[4381.26 --> 4382.06]  I miss it
[4382.94 --> 4384.22]  Mattering
[4384.22 --> 4386.86]  Yeah, man 3d accelerated sound effects
[4386.86 --> 4389.18]  It was fun getting like zonar cards and like
[4389.74 --> 4391.18]  I don't know it was cool
[4392.06 --> 4394.46]  And you could do things that were neat
[4396.94 --> 4397.26]  Yeah
[4399.66 --> 4406.46]  I don't know man you can still you can still get pretty into the weeds on usb dacks and amps and stuff
[4406.46 --> 4408.94]  And I have a usb deck if you're you know like
[4409.74 --> 4411.18]  Even those have gotten kind of boring
[4411.18 --> 4415.74]  Yeah, you can get something that's good enough you can get a good enough combo unit for 100 bucks and
[4416.30 --> 4417.98]  I feel like a lot of the
[4418.54 --> 4422.54]  Advancement in the last five years anyway has been just like chasing
[4423.26 --> 4426.54]  New preferred tonalities as a like it's more fashion
[4427.18 --> 4432.14]  And less actually trying to achieve accuracy like everything post odak
[4432.78 --> 4437.90]  As far as I can tell is just like or o2 or whatever it was that one that was like
[4437.90 --> 4440.94]  Yeah, this is good enough and it was like 130 dollars or something like that
[4441.18 --> 4447.42]  And yes, yes in our pursuit of perfection. I'm sure there's stuff that's better now, but
[4448.14 --> 4449.74]  I just don't care
[4450.46 --> 4452.70]  I'm still using my like mayflower o2
[4453.90 --> 4458.22]  Yeah, like 2013. Yeah, it works and it's fine. Yep
[4460.78 --> 4467.18]  Okay, hey dll I recently hit 1000 sorry 100 000 subscribers on youtube
[4467.18 --> 4474.38]  But i'm worried about maintaining long-term success with my channel or whether I should get a normal job after I graduate university next year
[4474.46 --> 4475.58]  Any advice?
[4475.58 --> 4477.74]  It's I really wonder what they do. It's hard
[4478.70 --> 4486.14]  Long-term success looks like a lot of different things to a lot of different people at 100 000 subs on youtube depending on what kind of content you do
[4486.70 --> 4488.30]  That is very easily
[4489.18 --> 4495.26]  Monetize a bull to the point where you don't have to work another job if you don't want to I shouldn't say easily that is
[4495.82 --> 4496.62]  Is possible
[4497.66 --> 4503.82]  However, what you have to consider is that in order to monetize a youtube channel you are effectively
[4504.78 --> 4508.06]  Adding another job for every way that you intend to do that
[4508.62 --> 4515.18]  So people will tell you oh, yeah, you can sell merch if you just put your logo on a t-shirt that's not going to get you very far
[4515.98 --> 4517.02]  if you
[4517.02 --> 4518.46]  develop
[4518.46 --> 4522.22]  If you develop products and market them and support them
[4523.10 --> 4525.26]  Guess what you just started a company
[4525.82 --> 4527.82]  essentially, right? So
[4527.82 --> 4529.26]  um
[4529.26 --> 4532.46]  You've got to kind of ask yourself what the youtube channel is to you
[4532.54 --> 4536.38]  Is it a creative outlet and something that you you want to do for fun?
[4536.38 --> 4541.02]  Is it something that you that you want to pour your life into you've already?
[4541.90 --> 4545.26]  Done the hardest part the first 100 000 subscribers is
[4545.98 --> 4549.18]  By far the hardest part of what you're doing
[4549.74 --> 4550.54]  um
[4550.54 --> 4552.54]  But that doesn't mean that
[4552.54 --> 4557.10]  Because you've done the hardest part you will magically have unlimited future success
[4557.50 --> 4561.02]  I I talk often about how everyone succumbs to the curve
[4561.58 --> 4563.18]  which is the
[4563.18 --> 4567.42]  Waxing and waning of interest from the audience and sometimes
[4568.06 --> 4569.26]  It's you
[4569.98 --> 4571.98]  Sometimes you've changed
[4571.98 --> 4576.94]  Sometimes it's them. Sometimes they change sometimes it's factors beyond any of your control
[4577.50 --> 4579.50]  um
[4581.58 --> 4587.98]  If you if you're in there's also niches like youtube niches that you could be in where 100 000 subscribers will not sustain you
[4587.98 --> 4592.38]  Because the cpms on it are incredibly low you won't get any sponsors on it etc etc
[4592.38 --> 4596.54]  But or if there are other ones yeah, like finance youtube
[4597.58 --> 4600.46]  Apparently there's been a lot of controversy over there lately. Oh, really?
[4600.46 --> 4604.06]  I don't know it doesn't really surprise me on all the youtube any any
[4604.94 --> 4609.90]  Anywhere you're making the kinds of cpms that I see like finance tubers making
[4610.86 --> 4613.66]  Whatever service that is is making so much money
[4614.38 --> 4618.78]  That they got to be getting it from somewhere. Yeah, and it's probably the users. Yeah, so like
[4619.26 --> 4620.54]  Yeah, that's that's reasonable
[4621.10 --> 4623.90]  um, but yeah, I I my favorite one is
[4624.78 --> 4627.58]  engaged enthusiastic professional niche
[4628.78 --> 4630.86]  Because when you combine those things
[4632.70 --> 4639.18]  That audience is like more likely to do things like external platform funding more likely to do things like merch person
[4639.18 --> 4643.18]  Purchasing whoo tough day. Um
[4644.06 --> 4645.02]  And and also
[4645.98 --> 4651.18]  Yeah, like become a member of your channel like support your channel directly so you could stay relatively small
[4651.66 --> 4657.10]  And as long as you're giving these people content that help their job or are just interesting to them
[4657.58 --> 4661.82]  Um, that's an audience that is more likely to support you the conversion rates
[4661.82 --> 4667.34]  And finances of some of these channels that fit that description are amazing when they're getting
[4667.98 --> 4670.30]  You know around a hundred thousand subscribers
[4670.78 --> 4676.86]  But this is paying them way more than a full-time job could at that time because their niche fits that little category
[4677.50 --> 4680.14]  But never change your niche to just chase money
[4681.02 --> 4688.06]  You have to do the thing that you're interested in and good at yeah, I am aware of other verticals that pay far more than tech
[4688.62 --> 4690.22]  Oh, yeah, why am I in tech?
[4690.22 --> 4693.90]  Is that what we do?
[4693.90 --> 4694.62]  That's what I do
[4694.62 --> 4700.14]  It's like if I wasn't if I wasn't sitting here talking to luke about what's happened in tech this week on the wan show
[4700.86 --> 4702.14]  we'd be
[4702.14 --> 4703.34]  Hanging out
[4703.34 --> 4707.98]  At the office. I don't know where would we work where where would we work that we would work together?
[4708.94 --> 4712.94]  What's our hypothetical company that we work at together today if it isn't this one?
[4713.74 --> 4715.02]  Huh?
[4715.10 --> 4717.18]  It's a tough one. That is actually a tough one
[4717.18 --> 4720.70]  Have you thought about what you would do if it wasn't this?
[4720.70 --> 4726.70]  uh, well, I mean there's there's the like what I would have done like I
[4727.18 --> 4733.66]  I was interested in uh pursuing a career as a teacher until I dropped out of university and therefore that was not an option anymore
[4734.14 --> 4736.86]  So you'd you'd be in like you'd be like product management
[4736.86 --> 4740.70]  Maybe I think that I could have gotten into into a non
[4741.10 --> 4742.22]  um
[4742.22 --> 4745.82]  Like non-certified teaching role of some so I shouldn't say non-certified
[4745.82 --> 4748.70]  I mean like have my certification to teach swimming lessons like I
[4748.70 --> 4751.02]  Is that what you would have wanted to do at that point in time though?
[4751.58 --> 4754.14]  Um, is that a thing you would would have been interested in pursuing?
[4755.10 --> 4756.22]  in
[4756.22 --> 4762.38]  2014 well, the thing is we have to pick something that i'm interested in pursuing that isn't tech
[4763.26 --> 4767.34]  And so the only thing I care I lived and breathed wait, so it can't be tech at all
[4767.34 --> 4771.90]  I thought I thought it meant tech youtube no no no no no it's not tech
[4772.86 --> 4773.98]  Then there's like no way
[4774.70 --> 4781.02]  Like we're at some non-tech company like talking about the developer we're we're around the water cooler at some place
[4782.46 --> 4787.42]  I don't know. I could easily still be I could easily still be at the pool. Maybe I'd be a supervisor
[4788.70 --> 4790.38]  Maybe I maybe I would train lifeguards
[4790.94 --> 4795.82]  I I could have seen myself that'd be kind of cool just continuing because i'm I think you would like that
[4795.82 --> 4799.50]  I'm always looking to to move up and it was clear that they needed some help
[4799.50 --> 4805.74]  I remember I remember doing my wsi training and having a lot of done that together having the um
[4806.06 --> 4808.62]  So wsi is water safety instructor
[4808.62 --> 4814.14]  So I was learning to be a swimming lessons instructor and I got into an argument with the
[4815.02 --> 4821.82]  Not just the instructor of our course for some reason the one who teaches people to teach wsi
[4821.82 --> 4827.50]  Was teaching us because she was being shadowed by a bunch of new wsi instructors
[4827.50 --> 4833.02]  So we had like the head honcho of like training wsi and I got into an argument with her because
[4833.66 --> 4834.62]  um
[4834.62 --> 4835.66]  she
[4835.66 --> 4838.94]  She was saying because we did like uh like sounds so on brand
[4840.06 --> 4843.02]  So she did a demo for us that was intended to
[4843.50 --> 4847.66]  Demonstrate how shocking it can be to uh be thrown into
[4847.66 --> 4854.38]  Um an unfamiliar environment even if you functionally know how to deal with it and and the example was
[4854.86 --> 4856.46]  um ice water
[4856.46 --> 4863.74]  Right which can cause you to forget to breathe uh it can cause uh muscle muscle tenseness and cramps um
[4863.74 --> 4867.50]  It can it can cause some real challenges if it's not something that you're ready for
[4867.82 --> 4872.46]  And you know it was part of like a conversation on just like being ready for anything when you're
[4872.46 --> 4876.22]  Um, and teaching people to kind of be ready for unfamiliar situations
[4876.94 --> 4877.90]  and um
[4879.34 --> 4884.38]  Uh, so she had us like plunge our our our arms. I think just like into ice water
[4884.94 --> 4887.82]  And um, and she was like yeah, and because of the ice
[4888.38 --> 4893.58]  um, you know, it's it's even colder than zero degrees and I was like, um, actually
[4894.46 --> 4900.86]  It's exactly zero degrees and she was like no, it's lower. There's ice in it and I was like
[4900.86 --> 4904.94]  Look, I don't want to like I don't want to be that guy
[4905.66 --> 4906.70]  but
[4906.70 --> 4908.38]  I'm in
[4908.62 --> 4910.62]  Grade 10 science
[4910.86 --> 4913.82]  And it's definitely exactly zero degrees
[4914.38 --> 4918.54]  And she basically like shut me down in front of the whole class and was like
[4919.18 --> 4925.26]  You're stupid and don't interrupt me when I am explaining important scientific concepts
[4925.26 --> 4928.94]  And uh, hey, thanks deanna
[4929.50 --> 4934.22]  Um, good job. That's actually not how that works. It was exactly zero degrees
[4934.70 --> 4937.82]  But anyway, the point is that I um
[4939.26 --> 4942.38]  It's not salt water guys. Yeah, no guys. It was
[4944.06 --> 4949.58]  Relax, it was it was fresh water. Okay. Yeah, um anyway, but the point is that I
[4950.54 --> 4955.66]  I could have seen myself, you know after having an experience like that wanting to move up the ranks
[4956.46 --> 4964.30]  And like improve the quality of training so that it has accurate information extremely on brand like that wasn't that wasn't the that wasn't the only dumb thing
[4964.86 --> 4966.06]  um
[4966.14 --> 4967.58]  Yeah
[4967.58 --> 4971.26]  Oh my god g freak 01. Okay. Do you guys do you guys need a science class?
[4972.70 --> 4975.02]  Okay, what is your consistency of brine?
[4975.74 --> 4977.74]  Remember they're americans
[4978.86 --> 4980.86]  Guys
[4982.06 --> 4988.46]  Once it has reached equilibrium, okay, when there is a when there is a phase change
[4989.18 --> 4996.38]  Okay, until the until the substance has completely changed phase and we're talking about water specifically in this case
[4996.38 --> 5001.42]  I'm not talking plasma or anything complicated. Okay, we are talking gaseous solid
[5002.14 --> 5003.66]  liquid phase changes
[5003.66 --> 5009.50]  Okay, so going between a solid and a liquid as it melts from solid to liquid
[5009.90 --> 5014.94]  It it is it is that that liquid is at a constant temperature
[5014.94 --> 5021.58]  And it is not until all the solid has become liquid that it can begin rising in temperature again
[5021.66 --> 5023.98]  I forget exactly the technical term for it
[5023.98 --> 5028.70]  But if you have a bucket of ice water, it is at zero degrees
[5029.18 --> 5033.18]  Barring any salt or impurities or whatever the case may be
[5034.06 --> 5038.62]  Yes, the core of that ice cube could be lower than zero degrees
[5038.94 --> 5044.30]  And at the very surface of that water or at a point where you're touching the side of the bucket
[5044.94 --> 5049.10]  The water molecules nearest that could be a little higher than zero degrees
[5049.10 --> 5054.86]  But by and large that heterogeneous mixture of water and ice
[5056.14 --> 5058.14]  is zero degrees
[5058.14 --> 5060.14]  If you don't think so
[5061.34 --> 5066.62]  It sucks to suck go test it. Yeah, yeah, you can find a little science experiment. All right. Yeah
[5067.90 --> 5069.90]  Jeez guys heterogeneous
[5069.90 --> 5071.26]  Elijah
[5071.26 --> 5079.66]  Man, I'm reminded of that awful video that we did where we tried to explain that when your cpu is running at a lower temperature
[5079.66 --> 5083.42]  That does not mean that your computer is kicking out less heat
[5084.30 --> 5087.18]  And just like how angry people were
[5087.90 --> 5092.30]  Half of people were angry that I was explaining something that was so obvious
[5092.30 --> 5096.94]  And the other half were angry that I was saying that a lower temperature cpu
[5097.82 --> 5099.74]  Means that it's the same amount of heat
[5100.54 --> 5102.54]  Because they didn't understand it
[5104.38 --> 5105.90]  Thermodynamics hard
[5110.22 --> 5111.66]  Yeah, anyway
[5113.66 --> 5113.90]  Cool
[5117.90 --> 5122.06]  Now it's time to do the ton of feathers versus a ton of steel one. Yeah, yeah, exactly
[5122.86 --> 5126.30]  I fell for that one when I was in high school. My dad pulled that one on me
[5126.30 --> 5130.94]  He goes what's heavier pound of feathers or a pound of bricks and I go pound of feathers or a pound of bricks rather
[5131.26 --> 5133.26]  And he's like no, they're both a pound dirt
[5133.98 --> 5136.38]  And I was like, um, uh, but the air resistant
[5136.38 --> 5140.54]  The packaging required to keep the feathers on the scale. Yeah, exactly
[5140.54 --> 5145.74]  Resulted in it weighing more linus hates hot dogs. Yeah, exactly. Uh, what are we supposed to be doing? Oh, right?
[5145.74 --> 5148.22]  We did a couple of merch messages. That would mean the feathers are less
[5148.86 --> 5152.78]  Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't the scale says a pound and there's packaging around it. Oh my god, it doesn't matter
[5152.78 --> 5157.18]  Uh, you got about six minutes till sponsors. You could do another quick talk
[5157.18 --> 5160.86]  Del main to you del main says the the best answer to that is
[5161.26 --> 5164.86]  The feathers because you have to live with the weight of what you did to all of those birds
[5165.90 --> 5169.18]  I think i've heard that before it's pretty good though. Did it involve a brick?
[5172.78 --> 5176.62]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[5177.50 --> 5179.42]  As a bird lover, he's very uncomfortable, right?
[5180.22 --> 5181.34]  Leave the bird alone
[5182.38 --> 5184.46]  You dunk them in the negative one degree water
[5184.46 --> 5189.42]  What if the water in the bucket was outside though?
[5190.06 --> 5193.90]  You can have you can have negative one degree water. Yeah, we've seen those uh, those
[5194.70 --> 5199.42]  Like bottles of water in the freezer that you bring out and then they freeze as soon as you disturb them. Yeah, yeah
[5200.38 --> 5203.58]  Typical engineering mindset answer tynen goes
[5206.06 --> 5210.14]  That would be a horrible way to get feathers from a bird very inefficient
[5210.86 --> 5213.98]  Have you have you not seen the yeah, that's the problem tynen
[5213.98 --> 5218.46]  That's the problem with that well, they have those water bucket tumbling things
[5221.26 --> 5221.74]  No, like
[5221.74 --> 5228.86]  Legitimate like is that a thing? Yeah, you get you get the feathers off of it. Wow, it comes full circle. Yeah, all right, cool
[5229.34 --> 5236.06]  Uh, what are we? Oh, yeah, I wanted to talk about some pretty exciting water bucket tumbling thing. I wanted to talk about exciting things
[5236.94 --> 5242.70]  Um, okay, uh lime days. Oh, I oh, apparently past increase. Is that an exciting thing?
[5242.70 --> 5249.42]  Uh, apparently I have a couple more deals to preview. Oh, uh, 3d down jacket is going to have a great deal during lime day
[5249.42 --> 5253.26]  Uh, we're also going to have an amazing bundle deal featuring the circuit desk pad
[5253.82 --> 5257.50]  Right when lime day starts on tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific time
[5257.50 --> 5261.90]  You are not going to want to miss this one. So if you're watching wanshow now you have a heads up
[5261.90 --> 5266.22]  It's going to be limited quantity. So be ready the deals are going to rotate every day though
[5266.22 --> 5268.78]  So make sure you check back every day during the event
[5269.26 --> 5274.46]  Um and sign up to be notified. Um, oh dan's going to put the qr code so you guys can sign up to be notified
[5274.94 --> 5278.94]  Okay, the last thing is, uh, we have been working
[5280.46 --> 5282.46]  I had my mic muted. I just make those sounds
[5282.46 --> 5286.86]  I said boop
[5288.62 --> 5293.50]  Oh, I thought everybody heard it. No, I didn't know don't laugh. Don't laugh at me. Look it's so mean
[5296.54 --> 5301.98]  It's a lime day don't miss it. Okay, hold on hold on don't move the graphic don't move the graphic when they come back
[5301.98 --> 5306.94]  I want to see the thing. Oh, I mean you guys are still up there in the corner. Here you go. Oh a little bit
[5306.94 --> 5308.94]  I can let me
[5310.22 --> 5311.50]  Well
[5311.50 --> 5316.38]  Cat's out of the bag now. There you go. Or should I say under the brick? Did anyone see it? They might not have seen it
[5317.18 --> 5319.18]  That's the brick
[5319.26 --> 5321.26]  I said under the brick
[5321.26 --> 5323.26]  That's worse
[5323.50 --> 5326.54]  I thought that was an old but still checks out reference. All right
[5327.42 --> 5333.74]  We have been working dan you can cut to us on an anti-static pc building mat for the past year in
[5333.74 --> 5339.42]  Collaboration with mod right the creators of the original and patented mod mat
[5340.06 --> 5343.26]  Our goal was to provide a safe anti-static work surface
[5343.74 --> 5347.58]  Um, you know like the kind that everyone tells you you're supposed to use
[5348.06 --> 5351.90]  But as a price that doesn't take away too much from your pc building budget
[5352.30 --> 5357.02]  So with that being said we are going to be selling the ltd mod mat for 59.99
[5357.58 --> 5362.14]  It's four feet long by two feet wide so plenty of room for whatever you're working on
[5362.14 --> 5369.02]  It has visual references out here. Actually, should we go? Let's go linus cam for a change. Is this a final version?
[5369.58 --> 5371.58]  No, do you want me to hold it up for you?
[5371.66 --> 5373.66]  uh, maybe
[5373.74 --> 5375.74]  Okay
[5375.74 --> 5379.58]  Tons of useful charts and info it also looks super cool here
[5379.58 --> 5381.58]  We're just going to go to the wide cam because this thing is enormous
[5382.06 --> 5388.38]  It's dual layered so the top layer is dissipative providing electrical isolation between any two points on the mat
[5388.38 --> 5394.38]  The bottom layer is more conductive allowing for dissipation to the common ground point which is one right there
[5394.70 --> 5397.90]  And one in the top right it is heat resistant
[5397.98 --> 5401.10]  So bending tubes will be no problem here above it
[5401.42 --> 5406.46]  And it has a textured surface that prevents screws from sliding around while being easy to clean
[5407.10 --> 5413.26]  It has an anti-slip bottom, but actually I want to back up and say easy to clean again because this
[5413.26 --> 5415.26]  Is one of the big big?
[5415.74 --> 5416.94]  big
[5416.94 --> 5422.94]  Innovations uh luke go ahead and have a seat and dan do you want to move the luke cam to point at the table next to him?
[5422.94 --> 5424.94]  where his headphones are
[5425.10 --> 5427.10]  Compared to competing products
[5427.82 --> 5433.66]  We are extremely proud of what we've managed to do with ease of cleaning and luke's going to do a live demo which
[5434.38 --> 5436.38]  Never goes badly on the wan show
[5436.94 --> 5438.94]  Where he is going to
[5438.94 --> 5447.34]  Spill thermal paste on the mod mat okay and successfully clean it up so dan's going to aim at the table down there and you're just going to kind of
[5448.38 --> 5450.62]  Move your stuff get your get your stuff the heck out of the way
[5451.74 --> 5453.74]  There's there's a few changes
[5453.74 --> 5455.50]  Um that we're going to be making to it
[5456.06 --> 5457.42]  Is this a final version though?
[5457.42 --> 5460.22]  No, we're adding some more elaboration to the screw guide
[5460.46 --> 5463.18]  That's something that a lot of people ask about
[5463.50 --> 5465.42]  It's like what screw do I use for this or for that?
[5465.42 --> 5472.06]  So we've got little visual representations of all of them as well as what they're most commonly used for we've got thermal paste um
[5472.86 --> 5474.38]  stuff uh layouts uh
[5474.70 --> 5479.18]  Since since we did this one the ram guide that you guys are looking at that's right by my hand
[5479.50 --> 5485.74]  Uh, we you've already got the version that has lp cam and cam 2 on it, but we've added um separate ones for ecc
[5486.62 --> 5490.38]  For dims and so dims along with color coding where all the notches are
[5490.38 --> 5496.46]  Uh, we've got all the different m.2 sizes different radiator sizes different fan sizes uh the fan dots
[5497.02 --> 5500.30]  See there like the little guide for where you put it down those are color coded
[5500.62 --> 5503.66]  So that it's really clear that you're lined up with the right ones on the new one
[5503.66 --> 5506.94]  We also have a fan thickness chart now that they aren't all 25 millimeters thick
[5507.42 --> 5511.02]  Yes, yes, we've got the ethernet pinouts right i double checked that personally
[5511.02 --> 5517.90]  No, I was looking at the texture. Um, you can see it better in the in the yeah, okay
[5518.54 --> 5520.54]  Dan, are you uh, are you in position?
[5520.54 --> 5521.26]  Yeah, okay
[5521.26 --> 5523.34]  Where your finger is right there. So luke
[5524.94 --> 5530.06]  I'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna make a mess gonna glob it i'm gonna make a mess. Oh boy
[5530.14 --> 5532.70]  Do I get isopropyl or something? How am I supposed to clean this?
[5532.70 --> 5536.62]  Oh, wow, so you just you just
[5537.58 --> 5538.62]  Missed completely. Oh, wow
[5540.46 --> 5544.86]  I was gonna say you just missed the cpu completely, but then you also just rubbed it in there you go, buddy
[5545.18 --> 5546.22]  Have you guys done this?
[5546.94 --> 5549.18]  Um, I haven't I can't believe you've done this
[5550.86 --> 5556.22]  Okay, actually, can I have that cloth for a sec sure my finger has a lot of thermal compound on it now
[5556.94 --> 5558.86]  And I would like to type on my laptop here you go
[5559.18 --> 5562.30]  All right, should I punch in a bit more sure maybe digitally?
[5562.30 --> 5563.26]  Yeah, sure
[5564.14 --> 5566.14]  Let's see what I can do about that
[5567.66 --> 5573.50]  Uh, oh, I see why tine in's in the chat today testing these was fun this to be honest
[5573.50 --> 5578.14]  Um, yeah, tine and tine and has done a lot of work on this project tatiana
[5578.86 --> 5580.70]  did a lot of work determining
[5581.58 --> 5583.58]  Exactly exactly
[5584.14 --> 5586.86]  The perfectest most bestest of materials
[5587.58 --> 5588.38]  for us to use
[5589.10 --> 5593.02]  I am uh, i'm actually really really excited about this product
[5593.74 --> 5594.06]  It's
[5594.70 --> 5598.70]  Finally an affordable whoops wrong one luke cam
[5599.42 --> 5600.22]  That was so close
[5600.22 --> 5600.94]  I will
[5600.94 --> 5602.38]  Sorry, sorry, there you go
[5602.38 --> 5603.98]  Okay, you gotta not switch it right
[5603.98 --> 5605.02]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
[5605.02 --> 5609.02]  Well, I was trying to switch it to the one right as you're going for the first wipe I was on the wide
[5609.02 --> 5609.66]  Okay, go for it
[5609.66 --> 5610.38]  Go for it
[5610.38 --> 5611.74]  I guess away from the camera
[5615.34 --> 5618.22]  Yeah, you're gonna have to like you're gonna have to work at it. There's a lot there luke
[5618.22 --> 5620.62]  I don't know
[5620.62 --> 5621.26]  I haven't done this
[5628.46 --> 5629.58]  You better be able to clean it
[5631.10 --> 5632.30]  It might need more iso
[5633.18 --> 5635.90]  Yeah, tine says you might need some more iso. I put a lot on
[5636.78 --> 5637.42]  Yeah, that was a
[5637.42 --> 5642.30]  You really messed up you dropped like a thread ripper upside down
[5642.94 --> 5648.22]  Look guys, this wouldn't be this wouldn't be a live when show demo if I didn't make it like
[5649.18 --> 5650.78]  far worse than it had to be
[5651.74 --> 5652.14]  love it
[5652.14 --> 5660.54]  So we finalized the graphics
[5661.34 --> 5661.98]  probably
[5662.94 --> 5663.50]  let me think
[5665.98 --> 5666.86]  two days ago
[5667.50 --> 5670.78]  I went through and I did the last revision of
[5672.54 --> 5675.42]  changes to I think I found something that was
[5676.38 --> 5681.50]  not an error but a little bit hard to understand on the fan pinouts
[5682.62 --> 5686.14]  and then revised some of the wording on the screw thread guide
[5688.46 --> 5691.18]  We had to order a ddr5
[5691.82 --> 5697.98]  ECC SODIMM or something like that like I forget which one it was but there was something that we had to order
[5698.86 --> 5705.98]  in order to like validate that the measurements were exactly perfect and then other than that I think we're we're in pretty good shape
[5707.10 --> 5708.94]  You know you need to wipe that while it's wet right?
[5710.14 --> 5711.34]  Okay, I mean you're like
[5712.46 --> 5715.34]  You let the whole thing evaporate before you even scrubbed it
[5717.02 --> 5717.98]  Why don't you just do it?
[5718.54 --> 5720.22]  Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it properly?
[5720.46 --> 5721.18]  You ever think of that?
[5721.18 --> 5725.58]  No, no, it's dry. You're just you're you're you're dry dry scrubbing
[5726.46 --> 5728.46]  Yeah, there you go. Okay, that's a lot
[5730.22 --> 5732.22]  Well, whatever look Luke
[5732.22 --> 5739.74]  I think I have like there was so much thermal paste and i'm having a hard time getting like even clean parts of this
[5739.74 --> 5742.14]  Oh, man
[5742.94 --> 5744.94]  All right
[5744.94 --> 5746.94]  It's mostly gone
[5749.10 --> 5754.30]  All right, so guess what this is the part where I make it even worse
[5754.30 --> 5758.78]  You know, you know, what's a real bitch and a half to clean off of
[5759.50 --> 5760.54]  uh work surface
[5760.54 --> 5765.02]  What is it liquid metal?
[5765.02 --> 5766.06]  Oh my goodness
[5768.62 --> 5770.30]  Well, i've got some more isopropyl
[5771.58 --> 5774.86]  Uh, I don't even know if iso is your best bet
[5775.66 --> 5779.26]  Uh, tynen would you even recommend iso for liquid metal?
[5779.26 --> 5780.54]  You just try to wipe it straight off
[5781.26 --> 5784.62]  Tynen says the liquid metal is a pain in the butt
[5785.18 --> 5787.50]  I'm not gonna put that much on this time nice
[5787.50 --> 5790.38]  I'm not gonna put that much on i'm just gonna put a little bit because
[5790.94 --> 5795.26]  Realistically if you spilled liquid metal a lot of the time you would probably throw the
[5795.98 --> 5800.38]  The the needle back onto the syringe and try and try and suction it back up
[5800.38 --> 5803.34]  Yeah, which I have done on a number of occasions. Yeah
[5805.18 --> 5806.46]  All right, here we go. Here we go
[5807.66 --> 5812.38]  Here we go now if there was liquid metal in the bucket could the water have been
[5813.98 --> 5816.22]  Below zero degrees. All right. All right
[5817.50 --> 5819.50]  Okay, where's our spot right here? Yeah
[5823.50 --> 5823.90]  All right
[5827.66 --> 5830.70]  Well, here else okay, then i'll suck back up as much as i can
[5834.54 --> 5837.66]  Okay, but like it you know it got on there and stuff so you know
[5837.66 --> 5838.54]  Oh
[5839.42 --> 5844.94]  When it was still a ball, there you go buddy, there you go buddy, so you guys are saying no isopropyl for the liquid metal
[5844.94 --> 5847.42]  Uh, what did what did tynan say?
[5848.06 --> 5850.78]  Tyna knows tyna knows best. What did tynan say?
[5850.78 --> 5853.50]  He apparently said nothing
[5854.14 --> 5859.10]  Meanwhile, elijah is talking about bathing in liquid metal good lord
[5859.90 --> 5862.62]  I used ipa before isopropyl alcohol
[5863.58 --> 5864.38]  Yeah, all right
[5867.82 --> 5868.62]  Well, here we go
[5869.82 --> 5870.54]  Good luck luke
[5871.18 --> 5872.54]  What if I let it dry again?
[5872.54 --> 5877.34]  No pressure, but our you know gigantic order for this is all hinging on your performance here. Oh
[5877.90 --> 5879.02]  cleaning the liquid metal off
[5880.62 --> 5881.74]  Oh, no, that was too easy
[5883.10 --> 5885.02]  Well, here you can't you can't show it to the camera
[5885.02 --> 5890.70]  I like think I got it. Uh, oh, all right. Oh, there's a little dot left. Oh got it. Okay
[5891.82 --> 5893.42]  Well, that wasn't very much fun. Here's more
[5894.86 --> 5896.94]  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, let's verify
[5896.94 --> 5902.54]  Oh, no, no, there is still on there. No, you're gonna have to keep going. Hey, you still got liquid metal got him
[5902.94 --> 5905.50]  I started trying to wipe it and then there was like oh
[5906.46 --> 5908.38]  You should have got a ludwig swipe bidet then
[5909.50 --> 5911.90]  I wonder if I just wiped poorly and wiped it back on
[5912.94 --> 5917.90]  Mmm, that's a real possibility when you have that much thermal goop on your uh on your rag
[5919.58 --> 5922.70]  Oh, did you do we have more than one? Yeah, that's probably smart
[5922.70 --> 5930.14]  I think we're good now though. Okay. Now what people are asking is okay
[5930.46 --> 5936.30]  But what about the print and this is where this is where i'm actually really impressed with?
[5936.54 --> 5941.34]  Um, i've been wiping over the print this whole time with the with the quality of this product check this out
[5941.34 --> 5945.10]  Yeah, lift it up a little bit more. I'm trying to get like the good angle. Yeah, I want them to see it
[5945.42 --> 5948.86]  Because this this is I just wiped over this one right now quite a bit
[5949.50 --> 5953.42]  Yeah, lift it up a bit more though like the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah right there. Oh down
[5954.06 --> 5958.30]  There you go. So yes, that's where i've been actively cleaning if you're dedicated enough
[5958.30 --> 5965.66]  You can you can cause a little bit of damage to the print, but it's pretty impressive what it can uh what what it can withstand
[5966.46 --> 5968.46]  I think there's a little bit here
[5969.34 --> 5974.78]  There's a little bit. Oh, yeah, there's a little bit. Yep. I was also like scrubbing really. Yep. I know but but that's
[5974.78 --> 5979.74]  I mean, we gotta have realistic expectations. It's still it's still printed
[5980.46 --> 5986.54]  Um, the liquid metal came off really easy. Yeah, very the liquid metal honestly came off easier than the first amount of thermal paste
[5986.54 --> 5988.78]  But the first amount of thermal paste was a lot
[5989.82 --> 5997.50]  Very excited for this product. Uh, it also lies flat really well. Uh, we have to ship it rolled. Oh, we have packaging we have packaging
[5997.50 --> 6001.66]  Oh, yeah
[6002.62 --> 6006.54]  Created by of course the one and only sarah butt
[6006.70 --> 6011.74]  I assume I actually don't know that she worked on this packaging, but i'm pretty sure she did because it looks really good
[6012.30 --> 6019.82]  So she either did it or um, it was someone working with her under her uh, supervision because it looks freaking
[6020.46 --> 6025.10]  Awesome, um comes apart like this. Isn't that an automatic win? Don't all the designers do that?
[6025.10 --> 6027.90]  Woo do what work under her supervision?
[6028.62 --> 6029.58]  Um
[6030.78 --> 6034.14]  I think so. Yeah, well, I don't know if lloyd technically does
[6034.94 --> 6038.78]  He's technically more senior than sarah, but they collaborate they work with each other. I mean we're collaborative
[6039.02 --> 6040.46]  They're gonna ship the other way
[6040.46 --> 6042.06]  So with the graphics inside
[6042.06 --> 6047.50]  But it still unrolls really well, which was something that was really important to us because it's a major pain point
[6047.90 --> 6050.38]  Uh with other anti-static work surfaces
[6051.42 --> 6054.54]  Oh, the packaging was gary wow, he did a great job
[6054.54 --> 6060.86]  It looks great. It looks really sharp. Sarah almost certainly gave input because gary definitely um works under under sarah
[6061.66 --> 6067.58]  By the way, looks fantastic shout out shout out gary keeping our team in it at softball night the other night. Oh, yeah
[6068.14 --> 6074.06]  Yeah, I uh, gary gary's gonna be my first pick next time. I'm uh, next time i'm team captain. I'm
[6074.70 --> 6076.94]  I'm i'm pretty i'm pretty impressed. He's uh
[6077.82 --> 6079.50]  He's a player goes hard
[6079.50 --> 6084.06]  Like I love it. I respect it respect it. I just offended
[6084.94 --> 6085.90]  Elijah's offended
[6085.90 --> 6091.58]  Yeah, why not you I don't know elijah maybe because you got two outs on your own team last time
[6093.10 --> 6095.50]  So we play it we play kind of a different format
[6096.06 --> 6099.26]  Um, how do you do that? I will explain i'll explain
[6099.82 --> 6104.54]  Uh, we play we play an unusual format where you pitch to your own team
[6104.54 --> 6111.02]  Oh, okay, okay, so but we don't do we don't do strikes and balls or anything like that
[6111.02 --> 6116.14]  Like it's a super friendly casual format where everyone on each side gets to bat
[6116.46 --> 6122.38]  You have a designated pitcher who basically just like tosses it to you, but everybody gets only two pitches
[6123.10 --> 6126.06]  That's it. It doesn't matter how good they were how bad they were
[6126.06 --> 6132.30]  So it's in the interest of the pitcher to pitch the easiest possible lob and it's in the interest of the batter
[6132.54 --> 6137.26]  To swing at every ball because you get only two pitches. No, that's it
[6137.66 --> 6139.42]  um, so what's cool about the format is
[6140.22 --> 6147.98]  In a in it gives everybody an opportunity to bat every single inning it keeps things moving pretty quickly and you get a ton of offense
[6148.22 --> 6152.62]  So people aren't just like standing out waiting bored in the in the field, right?
[6152.62 --> 6159.82]  Um, so anyway, one of the sort of idiosyncrasies of this format which uh chewy was the one who introduced me to
[6160.38 --> 6164.22]  is that you have two pitchers on the mound because
[6165.66 --> 6166.94]  one person
[6166.94 --> 6169.98]  on the team of who's batting is throwing the ball
[6170.54 --> 6178.70]  But somebody still has to play the field position of pitcher in case got somebody bunts or or kind of flubs it and it's too far from the catcher
[6178.70 --> 6179.10]  yeah
[6179.90 --> 6180.94]  so
[6180.94 --> 6182.14]  one of the rules then
[6182.86 --> 6186.78]  is that if the pitcher who's not playing
[6187.66 --> 6191.26]  defense right if the pitcher interferes with the ball
[6192.06 --> 6194.06]  the batter's out
[6194.22 --> 6194.62]  twice
[6196.06 --> 6196.54]  twice
[6197.42 --> 6199.18]  Elijah interfered with the ball
[6200.06 --> 6203.18]  and got his batter out over the course of a four inning game
[6203.18 --> 6205.02]  however, however
[6205.02 --> 6207.02]  in fairness to elijah
[6207.02 --> 6209.50]  Sarah who was pitching for our team
[6210.14 --> 6215.10]  uh and throwing some scorchers it turns out she has some uh softball experience
[6215.66 --> 6215.98]  um
[6216.78 --> 6221.58]  Sarah who was pitching for our team not only got one of our batters out she caught the ball
[6222.54 --> 6227.42]  like didn't just like get hit by it or whatever like elijah got hit in the ankle by one of them or something like that
[6227.42 --> 6229.26]  Sarah like was like
[6230.06 --> 6231.18]  and caught it and we're like
[6231.90 --> 6232.62]  Sarah
[6234.62 --> 6235.26]  that's pretty good
[6235.26 --> 6237.26]  the reflexes were too strong
[6237.26 --> 6240.70]  i went and played once and i actually really liked playing the neutral pitcher
[6240.70 --> 6244.38]  it was fun because like if you play it in a true way
[6245.10 --> 6250.70]  you are playing for the team that is batting and then the second that the bat connects with the ball
[6250.70 --> 6252.22]  you're playing for the team in the field
[6252.22 --> 6253.02]  yeah that's wild
[6253.02 --> 6257.34]  so it was like kind of fun like really wanting them to hit it then the second they hit it you're like
[6257.34 --> 6257.98]  ah i gotta get it
[6260.30 --> 6262.14]  well it's more fun to get them out if they hit it
[6262.14 --> 6263.10]  yeah exactly
[6263.10 --> 6268.62]  uh oh no oh no oh shoot i didn't realize chewy was watching he's all upset that he's not first pick
[6268.62 --> 6271.58]  chewy you're good too but your batting's been kind of inconsistent lately
[6271.58 --> 6272.22]  whoa
[6272.22 --> 6274.22]  i
[6274.70 --> 6280.62]  mine has two next community review mine has toxic i'm on that no i'm on i'm on that
[6280.62 --> 6289.10]  oh dude dude dude no like i i i'm a pretty toxic competitor as you know yeah um i literally almost
[6289.10 --> 6294.86]  killed charade from the sales team yep um oh you were there for that's right you were there for that
[6295.42 --> 6304.06]  so in fairness to me it was a good throw it was a great throw does the quality of the
[6304.06 --> 6307.98]  throw scale based on the person you're throwing it at like if you threw that at a four-year-old would
[6307.98 --> 6313.82]  it be a good throw are you calling charade a four-year-old no i don't know um that's fair
[6313.82 --> 6315.58]  no this is a mario kart luke
[6320.22 --> 6324.22]  oh that's a not everyone's gonna get that reference but that was pretty good the play was to home
[6324.22 --> 6330.06]  okay in fairness to me it was a laser beam of a throw right at his chest yeah
[6330.06 --> 6336.78]  he's not a super experienced baseball player so his instinct was to catch it with his throwing hand
[6336.78 --> 6343.26]  which did not have a glove on it i think he did actually catch it though right uh no i think he
[6343.26 --> 6348.30]  he dropped it he like like got it a lot but i think he actually didn't make the play ultimately
[6348.94 --> 6358.06]  um but it's a miracle that i didn't break his hand yes yeah anyway i i just i get i get amped up
[6358.06 --> 6361.74]  and i you know i was i was throwing for the out what can i say
[6361.74 --> 6371.50]  i can say about our sponsor uh yeah let's do sponsors thanks dan uh the show is brought to you

[6448.22 --> 6460.94]  wide cam uh for my wedding my gift from my mother um was a uh i don't know it's a fig tree i think it is
[6461.82 --> 6467.18]  i think it's a fig tree anyway the point is it wasn't really one fig tree it was kind of two fig trees
[6467.18 --> 6472.78]  and what she had done is as they were young she had twisted them together so that they grow together
[6472.78 --> 6479.66]  like this um when she and of course it was you know like the two lives intertwined yeah kind of thing
[6479.66 --> 6485.34]  right okay um yes that was my wedding gift for my parents a plant but that's a whole separate
[6485.34 --> 6490.94]  conversation the point is that when we received it it was about this tall and was kind of like
[6490.94 --> 6496.22]  twisted up and she was like oh yeah and as it ground or the desk from from a pot pot that's like that's
[6496.22 --> 6500.94]  on the yeah it's the it's the one that's by the kitchen table you know the one right talking for
[6500.94 --> 6506.22]  them oh got it got it but you know the one right okay so it was it was about it was about this tall
[6506.22 --> 6515.82]  maybe this tall and um now here we are um yvonne and i are i believe 13 lucky 13 years into our marriage
[6515.82 --> 6522.06]  and it's about this tall every time i remember her telling us oh yeah as it continues to grow you
[6522.06 --> 6528.22]  should continue to twist it and uh every time she comes over i think she points out that it uh for it to
[6528.22 --> 6533.90]  keep growing uh we would have to water it oh and put it in a bigger pot yeah and every time i go
[6534.78 --> 6541.02]  yep oh yeah you know you could use your fancy home automation thing to water that automatically sure
[6541.02 --> 6546.86]  could yeah just saying i like it the size it is i like it the brownish greenish color that it is
[6548.70 --> 6553.98]  i am not good at taking care of plants uh dang y'all been married a long time tell me about it
[6553.98 --> 6561.18]  poor yvonne my grandpa gave me this aloe vera plant um like forever ago i can't i can't even
[6561.18 --> 6566.94]  remember when he got it for me but it's it's ancient like it sat on the windowsill above where
[6566.94 --> 6574.38]  my computer desk was when i lived in the split one half of the basement suite in the old office nice
[6574.38 --> 6581.02]  so like i had this with me in 2013 um and it's an aloe vera plant so they you know you don't need to
[6581.02 --> 6586.94]  water them that often uh that contributed to the already what you would probably expect is not
[6586.94 --> 6591.66]  amazing care that i would give a house plant yep um by being like i probably don't need to water it's
[6591.66 --> 6596.38]  an aloe vera plant it's fine uh so i would just like ignore it for huge periods of time and then
[6596.38 --> 6602.30]  somebody it genuinely wasn't me put like a box or something in front of it uh-huh so it was now gone to
[6602.30 --> 6609.02]  me forever so i left it for a long time still lived somehow don't know how um it it has since gone
[6609.02 --> 6613.18]  through like a bunch of things that you would think it would not survive through and it just
[6613.18 --> 6619.58]  has survived through everything it even like i don't know what it's called but it created another
[6619.58 --> 6625.34]  one of itself but the original one did it or something die off so there's like two of them now
[6625.34 --> 6631.74]  and they're still both alive perfect it's crazy it's very like kind of thin you heard it here first
[6631.74 --> 6639.18]  guys uh if you're a luke aloe vera is the plant for you yeah pretty much yeah anywho let's tell you

[6688.06 --> 6694.94]  want to buy one with our sponsor csonic who wrote this nonsense csonics prime tx 1000 watt power supply
[6694.94 --> 6700.30]  won't break a sweat in some of the most demanding gaming setups your power bill isn't getting any
[6700.30 --> 6706.54]  cheaper but thankfully the tx 1000 has an 80 plus titanium rating which means less energy goes to waste
[6706.54 --> 6711.82]  that could even translate to a few extra bucks off your energy bill csonics power supplies are quiet
[6711.82 --> 6718.06]  and built to last and backed up with a 12 year warranty let's go at least this particular model
[6718.06 --> 6722.46]  is actually i think they bumped them all okay i don't know the point is it's a better time than
[6722.46 --> 6726.86]  ever to grab one of their power supplies as csonic has been running several sales throughout the year
[6726.86 --> 6731.42]  so if you're building a new system and looking for a power supply you can rely on you can trust csonic

[6736.62 --> 6742.54]  few companies that used to be basically oem only that has i think really successfully translated into
[6742.54 --> 6746.70]  being a retail brand i remember when they did that and i was very happy yeah because now i didn't have
[6746.70 --> 6754.46]  to google which power supply on the shelf was a season okay cool the one that says seasonic on the
[6754.46 --> 6759.10]  front yeah it was helpful all right what are we supposed to be doing dan oh i got some merch messages

[6784.62 --> 6790.30]  the only thing wrong with all of them is that they are super super expensive
[6793.66 --> 6797.98]  i'm going to do a quick search in the email that i'm definitely not logged into
[6797.98 --> 6804.46]  and then uh if i don't find it then um then we don't have it

[6909.18 --> 6918.94]  i really wonder what his is the frustrating part is it is probably better than mine
[6924.86 --> 6934.14]  do i just start going while you're still typing sure uh i i think i would enjoy doing like a micro style
[6934.14 --> 6940.54]  jobs series but it wouldn't necessarily have to be like dirty jobs in particular i wouldn't be against
[6940.54 --> 6945.58]  doing that but it wouldn't have to be that but i i've always like when i go on vacation these days
[6945.58 --> 6953.10]  my favorite thing has been to do stuff i don't want to explore cities i like doing stuff and uh
[6954.14 --> 6958.30]  there has been scenarios where i've had an opportunity to effectively like do someone's job
[6958.30 --> 6962.62]  with them for a couple days and that's actually been really cool so that'd be fun okay i got a
[6962.62 --> 6968.14]  better series all right what is it luke gets a detached home and does like a house tech improvement
[6968.14 --> 6974.30]  series but it's like kind of janky budget stuff like wait didn't they say what murphy style fold
[6974.30 --> 6980.06]  out gaming setups for lands and stuff like that oh that'd be pretty sick they're both good we both had
[6980.78 --> 6985.58]  someone said micros anti-worker i don't know anything about the dude this is not a like man you can't
[6985.58 --> 6991.34]  do the like someone mentioned the thing and they are endorsing the thing thing on the internet i hate
[6991.34 --> 6995.18]  that because like i haven't deeply researched every single thing i'm ever going to talk about
[6995.82 --> 7003.66]  i just mean the show i've watched it like twice i don't know anyways oh um i didn't didn't they say it
[7003.66 --> 7008.94]  was supposed to not be tech or whatever oh i thought it was what did they say anything it could be about
[7008.94 --> 7014.62]  anything i win oh i just assumed it wasn't like what we literally do as a job oh all right
[7014.62 --> 7021.18]  right anyway i think i think i think it would be a cool concept to do tech improvements to luke's
[7021.18 --> 7030.78]  new house where luke actually has to like pay for what it is but what we contribute is like the labor
[7032.78 --> 7040.14]  so that so that everything that we do has to be practical and useful but it'll be done on a luke
[7040.14 --> 7047.50]  budget that would be so i get to like basically troll you guys that would be sick that would actually
[7047.50 --> 7048.62]  be pretty fun probably
[7051.58 --> 7058.94]  very excited i don't know let's do one more here okay um what might be the most atrocious tech that
[7058.94 --> 7064.46]  you see being used consistently on a day-to-day that should not legitimately exist
[7068.62 --> 7076.22]  oh man i feel like the troll response is like consoles but i like should not exist i can't think of
[7076.22 --> 7082.38]  too many things that shouldn't exist i mean i'm a i'm a firm believer that well okay not entirely but
[7082.38 --> 7088.46]  for the most part i i believe that there's no such thing as a bad product just a bad price right like
[7088.46 --> 7096.62]  that at the right price anything can make sense um i mean i i hate seeing you know any device that ships
[7096.62 --> 7102.46]  with you know an out-of-date insecure operating system on it so you know a lot of the a lot of
[7102.46 --> 7109.02]  like really cheap android devices that are running ancient versions of android i i that very much is
[7109.02 --> 7116.14]  used on a daily basis by many people and i mean like non-upgradable to a safe version yeah exactly
[7116.14 --> 7123.18]  so things like we we did a whole video on those sketchy um like android tv boxes and stuff like that
[7123.18 --> 7129.02]  that are running ancient versions of android that probably have back doors and all kinds of phone
[7129.02 --> 7135.74]  home behaviors in them and people buy them because they want to watch pirated streams and stuff like
[7135.74 --> 7141.66]  that but what are they giving up we don't we don't even really know yeah yeah i was gonna say computers
[7142.94 --> 7148.46]  thanks dan they're evil really helpful you should probably find a different line of work if you don't
[7148.46 --> 7154.94]  want to deal with computers evil i've spent my whole life trying to contain them hey um speaking of
[7154.94 --> 7161.34]  spending your whole life i've got an exciting project for us um one of the things one of the things
[7161.34 --> 7166.94]  that died during the flood of my server rack wait did i already talk about this last week uh did i
[7166.94 --> 7173.18]  talk about the ebay ups i don't think so no okay you talked about the story of the the thing dying so i
[7173.18 --> 7181.18]  shot the video this week with my my son actually was a helper uh tearing down and checking the various
[7181.18 --> 7186.86]  systems for corrosion nice and i'm not going to spoil too much of the video other than to say that it's
[7186.86 --> 7194.70]  going to blow your mind and it raises more questions than it answers so make sure you watch it um but
[7194.70 --> 7202.22]  one of the things that died is the ups at the bottom of the rack it's a 9x p5 something i don't know it's
[7202.22 --> 7211.18]  some eaten 5000 watt um ups and i went on ebay to find out how much those are worth um because i hadn't
[7211.18 --> 7222.06]  looked at it in a while and i forgot yeah cool five grand that is unless you can find a shipping
[7222.06 --> 7228.78]  damaged one that got the absolute kicked out of it from some like you're gonna swap the chassis or
[7228.78 --> 7239.74]  discount discount server equipment place and you make them a lowball offer of 300
[7241.18 --> 7249.10]  and then you use your good chassis yeah and you put non-water damaged boards in it
[7249.66 --> 7255.82]  so dan do you want to build a ups with me heck yeah let's do it all right that sounds a lot of fun
[7255.82 --> 7264.54]  yeah dan has so much work to do i'm gonna save 4300 or 4 700 this does this does sound uh
[7265.34 --> 7271.74]  worthy of dan's time stay the path says sounds dangerous af why do you think i want dan to help me
[7272.70 --> 7277.98]  that man yeah he's gonna make sure the caps don't discharge themselves into my eyeballs i'll wear a red
[7277.98 --> 7285.18]  shirt it'll be fine oh no um don't do that luke we could use this as a um like a exercise in figuring
[7285.18 --> 7291.02]  out the entire process oh yeah dan could participate look at this guy i don't even have to do task
[7291.02 --> 7298.22]  all right he just does it himself double work double work more efficiency oh yes boss could i have
[7298.22 --> 7302.86]  more work please please sure no you have to finish your first one before you could have more work
[7302.86 --> 7304.06]  give me your boots to lick
[7306.94 --> 7313.26]  oh no oh no um you already missed the part where i sent a random email to james in the middle of the
[7313.26 --> 7320.94]  night pitching the video so you'll have to put that on your flow chart anywho oh god yeah okay
[7320.94 --> 7327.50]  will that come up in the writers meeting on monday no is that when it would come up writers meetings
[7327.50 --> 7331.90]  are on friday and the reason i was late for wang show today what's the one on monday
[7333.90 --> 7338.30]  one on monday i don't know what happens on monday i work from home on mondays isn't there one on monday
[7338.30 --> 7342.94]  i don't know am i wrong dan did you move it from monday to friday i don't know maybe i'm just
[7342.94 --> 7347.82]  bugging you i'm no i'm i probably just don't know i i think right at some point writers meeting was on
[7347.82 --> 7352.62]  mondays i think okay yeah i don't know elijah would actually probably know better than me that meeting
[7352.62 --> 7358.70]  at the start of the chart do you know when that is nope okay uh i just know that it's the the first
[7358.70 --> 7363.50]  part okay yeah i if it happens on friday but basically what i'm saying is would it wait to come
[7363.50 --> 7370.06]  up in that meeting um you've already made a trello card for it maybe not necessarily if i'm just like
[7370.06 --> 7375.18]  this is green lit because doing this procurement is buying this now there's there should be a path
[7375.18 --> 7379.66]  for that actually because we we actually do want that to be able to be a thing because that will
[7379.66 --> 7387.98]  increase agility this is good you want to be it's on the floor over there oh yeah i'm not saying
[7387.98 --> 7392.70]  necessarily do it now crystal gonna forget double work i'm gonna forget crystal d
[7393.42 --> 7398.46]  during when says writers meetings have typically been mondays who the devil are you i don't
[7399.98 --> 7407.18]  who is it crystal d fier 88 if you work here you need to reach out and get your account um
[7408.38 --> 7415.34]  badged so that people can yes know that um anyway on the subject of shooting with my son for that
[7415.34 --> 7421.90]  video which was a lot of fun um viewers and actually people internally have noticed and and
[7421.90 --> 7427.82]  commented to me about uh you know what's with linus's kids being in the videos more recently um
[7429.10 --> 7435.82]  they were all in the gaming minivan video and then my son was in the flooded server video um and
[7436.38 --> 7441.74]  someone on someone on staff asked me point blank like are you are you priming them to take over the
[7441.74 --> 7448.62]  family business is little man becoming big man yeah i um and the i i don't know it was an interesting
[7448.62 --> 7452.94]  question one that i have thought about in the past but honestly haven't really thought about in a while
[7452.94 --> 7460.06]  since they hadn't seemed that interested for a pretty long period yeah and the answer is no uh i'm not
[7460.06 --> 7467.74]  a believer in um in the the merit of nepotism i don't think that it is a particularly valuable thing
[7467.74 --> 7473.34]  what if one of them applied well then i would expect us to give them a fair shot like we would
[7473.34 --> 7480.14]  any other applicant um isn't that against the handbook is what against the handbook hiring family
[7480.14 --> 7488.38]  members oh that's interesting i think it's a team thing yeah it might be it might be department related
[7488.38 --> 7493.34]  yeah i know there's a lot of like yeah a different department who cares what what would your would you
[7493.34 --> 7500.30]  be on the should be an accountant that'd be fun i have no idea what team are you on are you on all
[7500.30 --> 7505.74]  of the teams i don't know i don't know i think i just sit on an island i think company structure wise
[7505.74 --> 7511.18]  you're on an island yeah so i don't think i'm on any team yeah okay so then i guess i don't count
[7512.70 --> 7518.86]  yeah i think i don't know technically i think technically like company structure tree wise
[7518.86 --> 7527.10]  that is legitimate um you couldn't hire him to be a c level that would be on your tree
[7527.10 --> 7532.86]  because that's your like department no i don't think it is i don't think any of the c levels report
[7532.86 --> 7537.58]  to me they all report yeah you're in the other if you were on the writing team other writers might not
[7537.58 --> 7542.22]  report into you but you're on that team i don't know what he's saying is you're on like the staff team
[7543.02 --> 7547.58]  i don't that might actually be legit no i think he's above everybody right because every department
[7547.58 --> 7553.90]  reports but this this gets into the weird part of like is he two people yeah am i two people yeah
[7553.90 --> 7559.90]  because he's the owner and he's one of the yeah i report to terran but terran reports to ownership yeah
[7560.54 --> 7567.26]  anyway i don't know the point is i don't know that um they have expressed a little bit more interest
[7567.26 --> 7575.10]  lately and it was super fun working on you know explaining um you know potential theories for how
[7575.10 --> 7581.18]  galvanic corrosion might occur in a closed loop where there's no obvious mixed metals um it was
[7581.18 --> 7587.82]  cool kind of walking through the troubleshooting steps and um one of the things that people a lot
[7587.82 --> 7596.46]  of people noticed on the minivan video was that kids um especially inquisitive ones open up opportunities
[7596.46 --> 7603.82]  for conversations that aren't always there if you don't have someone inexperienced who's who's who's
[7603.82 --> 7607.26]  there to ask the question and it's funny because this is something that i've known for a long time
[7607.26 --> 7615.10]  i remember talking to um seth curry back when we did that build where i walked him through how to build
[7615.10 --> 7619.10]  a pc and and what i what i told him i don't remember if it was in the video or if it was after the video
[7619.10 --> 7625.18]  but what i told him was i thought it was so cool that he was willing to be as someone with the kind of
[7625.18 --> 7630.62]  profile that he has right uh where anything he says or does can be misconstrued i told him i thought it
[7630.62 --> 7636.22]  was so cool that as someone with the profile that he has he was willing to put himself out there do
[7636.22 --> 7641.42]  something he has no experience with not know something ask stupid questions that other people
[7641.42 --> 7649.34]  are afraid to ask for fear of looking or sounding dumb and then absorb and learn and and push himself
[7649.34 --> 7654.30]  to do it like um i remember it taking a lot longer or it looked like it was going to take a lot longer
[7654.30 --> 7659.42]  than we had budgeted because he insisted on doing uh the aio mounting himself even though
[7660.06 --> 7665.98]  the whole thing was like like he was very protected on his side by i think asus sponsored it back then
[7665.98 --> 7670.62]  and they were like ready to leap in and do it for him if to make sure the product didn't look too bad
[7670.62 --> 7675.82]  or whatever right um but he like insisted on doing it himself and i just i thought that was really cool
[7675.82 --> 7682.70]  because um a lot of people look up like it or not a lot of people look up to athletes as role models
[7682.70 --> 7690.38]  and i thought that he was modeling a really cool uh a cool really cool approach totally um but one
[7690.38 --> 7697.34]  of the things that was great for me co-hosting that video was that him asking questions gave me a reason
[7697.34 --> 7702.62]  to answer them it gave me an excuse to talk about things that i wouldn't have if i was just standing
[7702.62 --> 7710.22]  there by myself building a computer and the kids do a really good job of that because they're naturally
[7710.22 --> 7716.46]  inquisitive they want to know what things are they want to know how they work and they give me a reason
[7716.46 --> 7723.66]  to talk about stuff that otherwise a really long time viewer might kind of sit and go okay why is he
[7723.66 --> 7731.50]  explaining what an lte puck is right well i'm explaining because not everybody knows and it's a way to
[7731.50 --> 7737.74]  without irritating those people who already know what it is address the questions that realistically a lot of
[7737.74 --> 7745.18]  like kind of fly by viewers who aren't immersed in this stuff are going to be thinking but not even
[7745.90 --> 7755.34]  realizing or not not not being willing to or being afraid to ask or um you know not wanting to deal
[7755.34 --> 7760.78]  with going and looking it up and ultimately finding the content less accessible so uh it's it's a really
[7760.78 --> 7767.66]  natural way to de-jargonify things uh with that said there are challenges um shooting with the girls
[7767.66 --> 7774.54]  on the minivan video they're still a little young to be legitimately useful and helpful in anything um
[7775.18 --> 7781.66]  and you know my son to a degree is not as autonomous as you know an adult would be like obviously i mostly
[7781.66 --> 7786.62]  work with grown-ups and you get kind of accustomed to okay go figure that out and they do because they're
[7786.62 --> 7794.38]  grown-ups um but it it's been kind of neat and figure it out sorry no no go ahead have you figured
[7794.38 --> 7800.30]  out the like compensation stuff yeah oh yeah we we we pay the minimum wage be perfectly honest with you
[7800.30 --> 7805.58]  um but we pay them for the hours that they work and they're kids like realistically they're going to
[7805.58 --> 7811.90]  spend it on stupid baubles anyway so it doesn't really matter like honestly my oh my daughter's we
[7811.90 --> 7817.18]  went to a glass blowing studio for an activity when we were down in great wolf lodge and my daughters
[7817.18 --> 7823.82]  each spent like 45 us dollars on little glass mushrooms and i basically i we we believe in
[7823.82 --> 7832.22]  making mistakes on your own and so i pretty much sat them down i gave them a talk each individually um
[7832.22 --> 7837.58]  and i basically could well individually because one of them did it in the first place and then we left
[7837.58 --> 7841.10]  and got lunch and the other one wanted to go back and get one of the exact same thing probably just
[7841.10 --> 7847.18]  because her sister did it so little kid things right and adults um so i basically sat each one of
[7847.18 --> 7854.70]  them down and i gave them kind of a talk that went it's your money you have been given it in birthdays and
[7854.70 --> 7862.70]  red pocket and uh by working on videos very occasionally uh for doing chores it's a lot of money i explained
[7862.70 --> 7868.14]  about the exchange rate and how our dollars are not worth as much as american dollars i
[7868.14 --> 7878.78]  um talked through sort of how long it takes to earn this much money versus how quickly we can spend it
[7878.78 --> 7884.78]  and you know what the fulfillment we might get out of spending this money on this particular thing
[7884.78 --> 7890.14]  might be versus some other things that we could spend our money on and if that's um and if that's a
[7890.14 --> 7895.50]  sacrifice that we want to make because conceptually money doesn't mean anything to a little kid and you know
[7895.50 --> 7904.30]  single digits age bracket right um however i believe in it being your money not my money so if that's what
[7904.30 --> 7909.82]  you want to spend it on then i i will facilitate that for you because they don't carry around bank cards so
[7909.82 --> 7916.94]  i have to do the transaction and then just transfer it um so if that's really what you want i'm not going
[7916.94 --> 7923.10]  to tell you no but what i will hope is that you will reflect on this purchase at some point once you see how
[7923.10 --> 7931.98]  much you do or don't make use of this glass mushroom um and you will that will impact your decision
[7931.98 --> 7936.62]  making in the future one way or another was essentially the kind of the conversation that i
[7936.62 --> 7942.70]  had with with the girls one of them hasn't even made it off of the kitchen island since we unpacked from
[7942.70 --> 7949.58]  getting home um and i forget where i was going with this right right right so they're probably just
[7949.58 --> 7956.62]  going to waste it uh my son's actually a saver he doesn't he's like super not materialistic i don't
[7956.62 --> 7961.50]  he doesn't really spend money on anything so i don't know what his motivation is yeah motivation
[7961.50 --> 7968.94]  is being based okay all right so he is luke says lieutenant beefy no no my other son
[7968.94 --> 7979.02]  elijah he should buy fortnite skins slash s he actually was gifted um v bucks that's what they're
[7979.02 --> 7985.98]  called right v bucks he was i think so he was gifted a v bucks card um for uh for a for a birthday or
[7985.98 --> 7991.34]  something at some point in the last year or so and i kind of talked to him about it i went okay so we
[7991.34 --> 7997.18]  know we don't buy v bucks but if someone gives them to us like yeah i guess you can spend them if you
[7997.18 --> 8002.78]  want but did you ask for v bucks for your birthday he goes no i didn't i go okay um and he goes also
[8002.78 --> 8008.94]  i tried to see if i could get a gift receipt but i couldn't because gift cards i'm sure i'm sure
[8008.94 --> 8013.50]  someone somewhere has figured out a technique for trying to read what's on it and try to return it
[8013.50 --> 8019.90]  or whatever maybe it's impossible i don't know but um he did fully understand that v bucks are stupid
[8021.10 --> 8026.94]  but he did spend like 50 worth of v bucks because he couldn't yeah i know he couldn't return it
[8026.94 --> 8031.58]  and he didn't ask for it i'm like okay sure why not yikes at that point like yeah sure
[8033.66 --> 8041.02]  oh ow oh my back is dead okay what are we supposed to be talking about luke you want to pick a topic
[8041.02 --> 8046.94]  uh sure what has this show even been about so far i'm not sure i don't know all right
[8046.94 --> 8053.90]  xbox game pass oh lordy this is a mess announced both a price increase and a new tier structure for xbox
[8053.90 --> 8062.14]  game pass alongside uh the okay alongside a three dollar increase to game pass ultimate from 17
[8062.14 --> 8069.58]  to 20 dollars microsoft has also removed day one access from game passes base tier now called standard
[8070.78 --> 8077.82]  really so right after announcing that all of those games they just had a huge event let's not forget
[8077.82 --> 8082.62]  this they just had a huge event very recently within the last few weeks i think where they announced
[8082.62 --> 8088.46]  every single game that was announced in that event was like day one game pass and then they take it
[8088.46 --> 8101.90]  away got them that's a huge yikes hold on and that's not even okay so they removed day one game pass from
[8101.90 --> 8106.30]  game passes based here called standard but standard isn't even the lowest tier anymore
[8106.30 --> 8115.34]  game pass core just keep going it's a mess dude just keep going just that's rough uh game pass core's
[8115.34 --> 8122.14]  annual price will increase from 60 to 75 dollars um that also doesn't have day one access um though
[8122.14 --> 8128.54]  its cost remains the same for users who pay month to month don't forget that game pass core is not game
[8128.54 --> 8135.90]  pass standard and doesn't include the game pass catalog of games wait what does it do then game pass core
[8135.90 --> 8144.38]  is a limited catalog of 25 plus games member deals and discounts and online multiplayer oh my multiplayer okay
[8144.38 --> 8154.22]  got it um sheesh gamers will no longer be able to use reward points to fund subscriptions i didn't know
[8154.22 --> 8159.26]  that was a thing i don't know how you get reward points moving on uh in other reporting xbox console
[8159.26 --> 8166.62]  sales are down 31 year to year according to the verge xbox cloud gaming is only a few months away from
[8166.62 --> 8173.98]  allowing gamers to stream their entire xbox libraries uh you missed a game past here there's pc game pass
[8173.98 --> 8180.70]  for 11.99 a month which does not have online console multiplayer included because it's just included
[8180.70 --> 8185.66]  because of course it is it's just like game multiplayer like why do you need a subscription
[8185.66 --> 8193.58]  for that um it does not have a limited catalog of 25 plus games on console but it does have the pc
[8193.58 --> 8202.78]  library of the game pass catalog of hundreds of games and day one game editions also my uh i oh i thought
[8202.78 --> 8208.38]  there was a fifth one is isn't there also a fifth one you guys i had come across an article that was like
[8208.38 --> 8216.38]  yeah no there's there's like one more tier that has games on the console but doesn't include
[8216.38 --> 8221.58]  multiplayer so you would have to buy the console multiplayer game pass core separately can you get
[8221.58 --> 8227.58]  a refund because what if what if you what if you watched that keynote watch them announce every single
[8227.58 --> 8233.74]  game is on game pass day one and then the tier that you're on just got dame one gay pass removed from
[8233.74 --> 8243.90]  it i don't know that's this is great though gero ninja says i would be devastated if i cared based
[8243.90 --> 8249.10]  seriously though game pass has been a good value in the past the price going up a bit does not change
[8249.10 --> 8255.10]  that it's still a pretty darn good value uh game pass core is looking like a terrible value and i guess
[8255.10 --> 8260.78]  that's part of the point of all this yeah that's essentially they're trying to push everyone to game
[8260.78 --> 8266.14]  pass standard which includes online multiplayer which to me is kind of a basic of owning a game
[8266.14 --> 8271.34]  console i guess so basically how they afford to sell you a cheap computer i don't think so i think
[8271.34 --> 8276.22]  they're trying to push people to ultimate because standard won't have day one games oh yeah i guess
[8276.22 --> 8281.26]  that's true so they're trying to push they're trying to make game pass core basically trash they're
[8281.26 --> 8286.54]  trying to make game pass standard frustrating frustrating because everyone that you know with your
[8286.54 --> 8291.74]  friends it's playing a different game because they have day one access and then game pass ultimate
[8291.74 --> 8299.58]  is for twenty dollars a month good lord 240 a year is there a yearly plan play on xbox it doesn't
[8299.58 --> 8303.34]  actually say it says the yearly plan for core and then it doesn't say a yearly plan for any of the
[8303.34 --> 8309.02]  other ones oh no apparently they're closing the 360 store too man this is wild this is wild you know
[8309.02 --> 8314.94]  what unsubscribe to game pass subscribe to flow plane pc game pass still gets day one games for 12 oh
[8314.94 --> 8321.66]  did i not yes pc game pass does but you can only use pc game pass on a pc so if you are a chump and
[8321.66 --> 8326.94]  give microsoft your money for their gaming machine then they treat you like a chump who gave the money
[8326.94 --> 8331.98]  instead of treating you like a valued customer that should get a good value that seems stupid yeah
[8332.78 --> 8340.14]  it does but hey on flow plane you can get adam continuing the rant against tech marketing so you
[8340.14 --> 8344.78]  get all the stuff that was not tight enough to make it into the video you get a closer look at
[8344.78 --> 8350.46]  what we learned a b testing thumbnails you get dan explains his new live feed camera every camera
[8350.46 --> 8356.30]  we use on set explained you can check out our cars and how we test materials at creator warehouse which
[8356.30 --> 8360.62]  probably are cool i haven't actually watched this one yet but probably has some um nuggets that didn't
[8360.62 --> 8365.42]  make sense until you knew about the upcoming mod oh interesting
[8365.42 --> 8370.54]  anywho what else we got what else we got for the people today
[8373.90 --> 8375.34]  um let's see here
[8378.30 --> 8384.70]  ryzen 9000 yeah amd's ryzen 9000 series processors arrived at retailers today ahead of the official
[8384.70 --> 8389.82]  launch sometime this month but in spite of promising leaks on their specs enthusiasm has been relatively
[8389.82 --> 8396.14]  muted uh considering that i didn't even know this happened uh yeah pc sales have been recovering from
[8396.14 --> 8401.74]  their post-pandemic slump but that doesn't appear to have translated into renewed excitement for major
[8401.74 --> 8406.78]  component launches yeah i mean considering the performance uplift and compared to you know what we've
[8407.66 --> 8414.94]  grown accustomed to getting over the last five to ten years i am kind of blown away by how little buzz
[8414.94 --> 8422.54]  i've seen for ryzen 9000 and i think a big part of it is that by not launching with x3d versions out of the gate
[8423.74 --> 8432.54]  amd is basically saying yeah gamers need not apply and the enthusiast segment and whether they game or not
[8433.10 --> 8440.62]  people who are really interested in gaming performance benchmarks are pretty much a circle yeah um and
[8440.62 --> 8447.26]  there's gonna be professionals who need the ipc and 12 cores but don't need gaming performance or the
[8447.26 --> 8452.70]  better power efficiency that we tend to see with the x3d processors and they'll you know pick up ryzen
[8452.70 --> 8459.18]  9000 for their editing workstations except like not a super ion workstation because they aren't going
[8459.18 --> 8465.82]  threadripper pro so it's like you got you got some users in there for whom ryzen 9000 is going to make sense but
[8465.82 --> 8476.54]  for an architectural move you know where we're moving to zen 5 and it seems like you know betterer um
[8479.58 --> 8488.46]  the hype level is just blowing me away here like the like the the lack of the lack of hype and it kind
[8488.46 --> 8495.50]  of makes me worried like if amd's cpus become not interesting what is there going to be left to be
[8495.50 --> 8500.14]  interested about from amd because their gpus sure aren't lighting the world on fire right now are
[8500.14 --> 8503.82]  they just going to move entirely to ai and data center and are we going to be left with nothing
[8504.38 --> 8510.62]  obviously that would be quite a few years off but like it's it almost feels like we're in this this
[8510.62 --> 8516.30]  negative feedback loop where they didn't really give us anything to be excited about for a long
[8516.30 --> 8521.90]  time and i'm talking collectively the big three your intel amd and nvidia actually you know what i'm
[8521.90 --> 8531.26]  going to include microsoft in there because microsoft dude windows used to be it a new windows
[8531.26 --> 8536.46]  would move also used to be boxes interesting but that's what i'm talking about so i'm going to say
[8536.46 --> 8545.10]  the big four didn't give us anything interesting so we got bored we got bored so you know sales of
[8545.10 --> 8550.54]  interesting things like something that really stood out to me as interesting even if it was kind of stupid
[8550.54 --> 8557.58]  was that weird collab that intel did with cooler master and ek where they made a peltier cooler for
[8557.58 --> 8563.74]  their high-end k-series chips that didn't improve performance in anything but gaming where slightly
[8563.74 --> 8570.38]  higher boost clocks on a couple of cores was going to eke out a few percent more performance all for
[8570.38 --> 8577.10]  like 350 watts of extra power consumption or something like that it was cool but it was sort of too little
[8577.10 --> 8583.42]  too late by that point so we're kind of bored and and cynical and don't care anymore so then why would
[8583.42 --> 8589.90]  they bother to you know produce new products at this breakneck speed especially as the cost of
[8589.90 --> 8594.62]  developing them goes up and up and up with each subsequent generation which makes us bored which
[8594.62 --> 8597.74]  makes them not bother which makes us bored which makes them not bother like are we just going to be
[8599.34 --> 8602.54]  is cloud gaming just the future whether we like it or not
[8602.54 --> 8607.74]  i think that's like the biggest thing that i hate about the direction of tech right now but i do
[8607.74 --> 8609.02]  kind of feel like maybe yeah
[8611.82 --> 8617.26]  i hate it though this is why i keep pushing back against these uh all you can eat game services
[8617.26 --> 8625.26]  because i think that's all going in that direction as well it's just i distinctly remember us sorry i i
[8625.26 --> 8629.98]  also want to say something that i forgot to say about the microsoft subscription tier increase thing
[8629.98 --> 8634.70]  is this is another reason we've seen this with streaming services we're seeing this with game pass
[8636.06 --> 8639.34]  it's so much better to just own your stuff because you don't know when the term is going
[8639.34 --> 8645.18]  to be changed suddenly disney plus or whatever it's even called has updated their pricing a bunch
[8645.18 --> 8649.42]  of times and it's way more expensive than it was when you signed up and now you are going to
[8649.42 --> 8654.54]  unsubscribe and suddenly have access to none of it even though you paid for this thing over a while
[8654.54 --> 8661.66]  it's a easier thing to stomach on the month to month basis but overall you're gaining nothing
[8662.62 --> 8670.94]  yep you'll own nothing and be happy yeah don't be happy not with that be happy in general i distinctly
[8670.94 --> 8677.34]  remember us having this conversation and i think it was about sixth gen or something like that we were
[8677.34 --> 8683.74]  we were at the langley house doing wan show and we were in that stuffy bedroom and we were talking
[8683.74 --> 8690.46]  about the rumor at the time maybe it was fifth gen i'm not sure anymore it was one of the two and we
[8690.46 --> 8696.70]  were talking about the rumor at the time that intel was going to move to soldered cpus on the motherboards
[8696.70 --> 8701.34]  so essentially you'd be you'd be locked in and the only thing you'd be able to change was ram
[8701.34 --> 8707.82]  and i don't even remember what either of our stances was on it but i remember the audience reaction
[8707.82 --> 8716.62]  was absolutely horrified at the end of diy and at this idea that you would just buy cpu motherboard
[8716.62 --> 8723.26]  maybe even ram maybe even storage just on a single pre-packaged pre-bought board at that spec off of
[8723.26 --> 8728.22]  the shelf and then what i guess throw it in a chassis that looks the way you like and you'd have expansion
[8728.22 --> 8736.54]  cards still but that would be about it and fast forwarding to today when apple's upgradable mac
[8736.54 --> 8742.94]  is a shadow of its former self like it hardly even has any cards that are worth installing it in
[8742.94 --> 8749.82]  anymore now that you can't put gpus in it and the gpu is integrated into the soc looking at
[8750.86 --> 8757.74]  qualcomm having absolutely no plans whatsoever as far as i can tell to do anything but completely
[8757.74 --> 8764.62]  soldered packages for what are now mobile chips but if they continue to be successful could conceivably
[8764.62 --> 8770.38]  make their way into a mini pc and then a small form factor pc and even a desktop i mean if the
[8770.38 --> 8776.70]  performance is there and you get gpu drivers for it who's to say that you wouldn't just buy a snapdragon
[8776.70 --> 8784.62]  or moving you know even farther into the future a risk 5 board of some sort that's a soldered a soldered cpu
[8784.62 --> 8795.10]  or soc is it finally coming to pass are we are we is it just over the horizon now the end of
[8795.90 --> 8802.86]  swappable components on motherboards i think laptops are leading the charge there absolutely like hardcore
[8802.86 --> 8810.86]  absolutely and laptop components have slowly but surely made their way into desktop computers uh there was
[8810.86 --> 8815.66]  one that we were looking at in writers meeting recently and i'm not logged into trello so i think
[8815.66 --> 8823.18]  it's going to be pretty hard for me to find this but it was like the smallest um water-cooled desktop
[8823.18 --> 8833.18]  and the truth is it it doesn't yeah here it is here it is uh the techno mega mini mini gaming g1 here's an
[8833.18 --> 8839.82]  article from video cards and it's hard to get a sense of exactly how small this thing is so to give you guys
[8839.82 --> 8847.42]  an idea this is not a 120 millimeter fan i believe that is either an 80 or a 92 millimeter fan
[8848.14 --> 8857.90]  this thing is flipping tiny uh let me see if i can double check the size of the fan so dim no it doesn't
[8857.90 --> 8864.22]  say uh so don't don't quote me on that maybe it's a 120 millimeter fan either way the thing is extremely small
[8864.22 --> 8874.94]  uh geforce rtx 4060 um the cpu is a core i9 3900h oh a mobile chip
[8876.30 --> 8884.46]  dun dun dun rtx 4060 water cooled not that that's going to achieve anything in particular uh but the
[8884.46 --> 8890.86]  point is that in our efforts to differentiate and you know build something that stands out from all the
[8890.86 --> 8898.30]  other semi black boxes we're ending up with designs that are using more expensive less modular
[8899.26 --> 8904.54]  and sometimes less performant i mean especially because performance and price are sort of you know
[8904.54 --> 8910.46]  slide against each other right so um if i say more expensive that inherently means less performant at the
[8910.46 --> 8915.66]  same price but maybe the same performance at a higher price the point is that sub-optimal right
[8915.66 --> 8923.82]  and people are buying these presumably uh yeah rest assured says minis forum has motherboards with
[8923.82 --> 8929.02]  laptop cpus that are killing it yeah i i don't i'm not sure if i quite understand because if i didn't
[8929.02 --> 8933.34]  mind less performance wouldn't i be better off getting like a last gen thing but i guess some people
[8933.34 --> 8938.30]  some people will not do that efficiency is really important as well that too and yeah some people just
[8938.30 --> 8943.82]  straight up won't do that um so luna says considering how long my cpu lasts anytime i need a new cpu i need
[8943.82 --> 8947.66]  a new motherboard anyway so imo it wouldn't matter much if they started being soldered on but right
[8947.66 --> 8953.26]  but reverse that considering how easily a motherboard can break wouldn't it be better to be able to
[8953.26 --> 8962.38]  take your cpu to a replacement motherboard modularity is good it's good but it costs money um
[8966.38 --> 8973.42]  and i just i just don't think they're i don't foresee an outcome where they continue
[8973.42 --> 8978.54]  to want to invest in it because i mean look at look at the okay
[8983.10 --> 8989.82]  just thinking back to uh like um uh level one techs uh wendell i love wendell um level one text
[8989.82 --> 8995.90]  did a video this week about intel's challenges with stability on their 13 900k and 14 900k
[8995.90 --> 9001.98]  and there was that um that game development studio that said that they're basically going all amd because
[9001.98 --> 9008.46]  all the intel cpu systems that they've had are crashing um and i was thinking about that and
[9008.46 --> 9014.94]  thinking back to some instances in the past where there have been uh motherboards blowing up or cpus
[9014.94 --> 9020.62]  failing because of mismatched capabilities with respect to the vrms on the motherboard and the power
[9020.62 --> 9028.06]  draw of the cpu and the socket and that's just one example um there's also the development of of sockets
[9028.06 --> 9035.50]  looking at looking how challenging that is like uh derbauer has his um his uh super cool low pressure
[9035.50 --> 9041.66]  ilm um noctua has a solution involving i think they're just still using washers to to reduce the
[9041.66 --> 9047.98]  pressure on the cpu to keep it from uh to keep it from going concave um just just all of these things
[9047.98 --> 9054.38]  if i'm intel or amd am i not just tired of it at this point
[9057.66 --> 9066.46]  probably most people are buying a you know a core i5 whatever k gaming cpu or i7 or i9 like there's
[9067.50 --> 9072.22]  thinking back to my days at ncix you could count on one hand the number of skews that move in any
[9072.22 --> 9079.34]  appreciable volume and for the specialty ones like your your low power you know s skews or um
[9081.10 --> 9085.90]  i mean amd doesn't really have too many like weird kitschy ones so on the intel side where they have
[9085.90 --> 9090.94]  a much deeper product stack like your weird low power s ones well you would just expect a partner
[9090.94 --> 9097.34]  to go and develop a board around it and solder it to it and ship it i don't know man i'm um
[9097.34 --> 9106.46]  i'm worried we might be coming close to the end and i'm gonna have to find different tech to be
[9106.46 --> 9118.38]  excited about and have fun with and make videos about well servers yeah servers will be the last to go
[9120.38 --> 9125.34]  i think servers are a big part of why we still have modularity yeah and i don't know how long they'll
[9125.34 --> 9130.86]  last i mean look at the way that uh nvidia was allegedly pressuring partners to buy the entire
[9130.86 --> 9135.90]  cabinet from them top to bottom well if that was the case nothing would have to be modular anyway
[9136.62 --> 9143.98]  it could all be as integrated or not integrated as nvidia deems fit and if you want it you'll buy it
[9145.18 --> 9150.54]  and if you don't buy it you're going to be behind the competition in this ai arms race that we're in
[9150.54 --> 9156.86]  right so no i don't think it's a given anymore but i do think that it's a big part of why we still have
[9156.86 --> 9156.94]  it
[9162.70 --> 9165.34]  let's cover something else yeah let's find something fun
[9168.54 --> 9172.86]  do you have any announcements left or are we good we're good yeah i think we're good on announcements
[9172.86 --> 9186.14]  that sucks burbs love burps the ltt screwdriver burps burp burp oh what is this oh okay here's your
[9186.14 --> 9191.66]  problem one second burp burp he works on other people's computers so often he said here's your
[9191.66 --> 9201.50]  problem burp when solving his own problem yeah amazing ads uh okay pc build with my talking parrot
[9201.50 --> 9205.02]  this is a six minute video we're not going to play the whole thing because you guys are going to have
[9205.02 --> 9210.78]  to watch it on your own yeah but i haven't gotten to i haven't gotten to try this yet or i haven't
[9210.78 --> 9218.30]  gotten to watch this yet but what i'm told is that at some point in this video uh the ltt screwdriver is
[9218.30 --> 9227.18]  involved and a burp is involved with it with it um these guys look like an absolute trip these birds
[9227.18 --> 9231.02]  okay well that's not an ltt screwdriver i'm not surprised he's trying to be involved
[9232.94 --> 9236.06]  is there is there a time stamp i'm supposed to look at here hold on a second
[9236.78 --> 9241.98]  apollo a pet african great parrot there's a link best known for his ability to recognize
[9241.98 --> 9248.14]  shapes colors and materials recently decided to help his humans assemble a new pc as a new pc
[9248.14 --> 9252.62]  building assistant he made sure to test all the tools and even performed a drop test on the ltt
[9252.62 --> 9258.70]  screwdriver he seemed to really love the sound of the ratchet mechanism that makes sense uh here we
[9258.70 --> 9270.70]  go okay i have some time stamps here we go here we go here we go uh oh that is amazing okay uh what
[9270.70 --> 9274.70]  what what what else we got uh here's a link to apollo's drop test
[9280.22 --> 9280.54]  nice
[9282.94 --> 9292.54]  drop oh that's super cute um what else we got here apollo knows what screwdrivers are made of
[9292.54 --> 9295.50]  probably says like the materials really bites it and then says the material
[9295.50 --> 9309.10]  yeah that's so cool yeah wow that is super cool really cool birds are smart look in general and
[9309.10 --> 9314.46]  they look like good trainer people i was i was about to say in general if someone were to say i'm gonna
[9314.46 --> 9320.46]  get a parrot i would tell them to not be an idiot and leave it in the wild and don't you understand
[9320.46 --> 9326.14]  they live for like 30 plus years um you need to not do that i think i was an african gray you you
[9326.14 --> 9333.18]  they often end up neglected and they don't get attention um 23 years apollo here apollo here seems to be
[9333.18 --> 9337.90]  getting a lot of attention and interaction which is what they need they're their flock animals right
[9338.54 --> 9345.02]  so you're part of their flock you can't just peace out for days at a time like they they've got a
[9345.02 --> 9352.14]  uh yeah they gotta they they gotta have a community so uh they looked like a very happy
[9353.10 --> 9357.10]  group of people that seemed like yeah people group of birds yeah they're having a good time
[9357.10 --> 9361.66]  they they seemed pretty into it the birds um so i mean obviously you never know what things are like
[9361.66 --> 9368.38]  behind closed doors or whatever else but it's seemed seemed pretty chill also ltd screwdriver made a
[9368.38 --> 9374.70]  an appearance in a corsair ad oh nice love to see it thanks reddit for uh flagging that for us let's go
[9374.70 --> 9384.94]  uh that was really jesus bacon all right sure username jesus bacon so is that bacon given to you by jesus
[9384.94 --> 9390.22]  or is it bacon made of jesus what's he bacon is it a cake do you eat it during communion
[9392.14 --> 9394.62]  oh i need like the body for breakfast
[9399.74 --> 9404.06]  all right we need to get off of this topic um do we just how long have we been live do we just do after dark
[9405.26 --> 9411.10]  so yvonne had an interesting pitch and we shouldn't do it today but she noted that other people are
[9411.10 --> 9417.34]  noting and she was kind of confused by how dark we are on lmg clips sometimes and she said she thought
[9417.34 --> 9424.38]  it was kind of stupid which is fair fair so after dark is in name only her pitch was that we would do
[9424.38 --> 9430.70]  different colors on the background for after dark we would have a more like nighttime vibe
[9430.70 --> 9435.58]  then why she gets the big bucks we'd have like bright colors for regular wanshow wasn't that a
[9435.58 --> 9441.90]  you story a me yeah that's why you get paid the big bucks yeah i had a colleague at ncix who definitely
[9441.90 --> 9448.38]  was earning pretty basic pay and was pretty much tolerated rather than um appreciated in the workplace
[9449.18 --> 9449.42]  and
[9449.42 --> 9454.86]  oh dan is playing doing it now oh
[9456.86 --> 9459.66]  that's kind of funny red and blue for when it's live and then purple for
[9460.86 --> 9468.70]  sure i don't know yeah twilight sparkle wait what um the point is that uh this particular colleague
[9469.26 --> 9475.66]  um wouldn't let me go get my own thing even though it was right there and didn't matter
[9475.66 --> 9483.82]  um and it was this like meaningless menial task where this particular person had been kind of
[9483.82 --> 9490.86]  shoveled away from hq so they wouldn't interfere with anything and just on like inventory um of
[9490.86 --> 9496.30]  one of the retail stores and they like got so mad that their toupee was like moving around on their
[9496.30 --> 9500.30]  head and because i wanted to just like grab something off of a shelf and they were like
[9500.30 --> 9505.50]  no you can't do it i do it that's why the owner pays me the big bucks that's why steve pays me the
[9505.50 --> 9512.78]  big bucks that's just what the you talking about um so so i used to be able to tell the story better
[9512.78 --> 9518.22]  with more details that were really funny um and so i told the story a handful of times to like other
[9518.22 --> 9523.42]  other managers once i was higher up in the company and i was like yeah yeah yeah he i remember this one
[9523.42 --> 9531.50]  time because we all this particular character was a character um and so whether it was catty and mean
[9533.18 --> 9537.98]  i'll let you guys judge it was catty it was probably cutting me it was catty and mean whether it was
[9537.98 --> 9544.38]  catty and mean we would swap stories sometimes about funny interactions that's not good that's not good
[9544.38 --> 9552.14]  that's not good have done that i shouldn't have done that i wouldn't encourage that um but it became an
[9552.14 --> 9559.34]  inside joke anytime we would do the most menial bull to say that's why steve pays me the big bucks
[9560.70 --> 9565.58]  i just i remember like back in the day you say that all the time so i was like pretty sure it was
[9565.58 --> 9571.98]  yeah the story the story was a lot fresher back then in my mind uh and it's also become it's become
[9571.98 --> 9577.74]  kind of a tasteless thing for me to say since i do actually get paid well now whereas back when i was
[9577.74 --> 9582.54]  like getting paid like a rank and filer with everyone else around me it made a lot more sense
[9582.54 --> 9588.94]  for me to joke about not getting paid a lot and doing stupid tasks so it just doesn't really work
[9588.94 --> 9596.94]  anymore yeah elijah goes omg is that why you say it yes apparently i've said it more recently than i
[9596.94 --> 9603.02]  realized okay yeah i probably shouldn't i probably i probably just shouldn't i think it's tacky now
[9603.02 --> 9611.50]  probably yep you don't get to fit in anymore probably tacky for you yeah okay i don't really
[9611.50 --> 9619.34]  like say it what did i even just say it in response i don't remember but i oh i said that about a vaughn
[9619.34 --> 9628.86]  oh yeah okay she also gets paid pretty well yeah um i want gift cards in exchange for ltt backpacks that
[9628.86 --> 9636.46]  makes sense you technically do apparently uh this was posted um on the subreddit scammer pretends
[9636.46 --> 9644.94]  to be linus willing to trade discounted ltt backpacks for gift cards even sent ai video of linus as
[9644.94 --> 9652.38]  proof oh scammer spent two hours to finally get this receipt amazing finish the payment then we can chat
[9652.38 --> 9662.14]  here's the screenshot where amount paid 300 purchased gift card recipient linus not ai smiley face what
[9662.14 --> 9669.26]  the hell is this it's a screenshot of the purchase mr linus really funny i don't know what you're
[9669.26 --> 9675.74]  talking about linus can i get that shout out now this is not a gift card you just playing with me man
[9675.74 --> 9683.34]  oh you are smart what game are you playing this is amazing that is very good and i have intentionally
[9683.34 --> 9690.14]  not watched this yet so we all get to watch seriously we all get to watch the scammers deep fake
[9690.14 --> 9691.10]  together now
[9692.22 --> 9697.34]  oh wow
[9697.34 --> 9705.90]  wow it's both a little bit confusing are a little bit convincing but also clearly so
[9705.90 --> 9712.30]  off yeah his hair is too perfect no no that's my what that's my hair it's not messy enough no that's
[9712.30 --> 9718.06]  his like skin and his hair also don't move together properly look at this eyeball or look
[9718.06 --> 9724.22]  at this iris it's like over here it's like looking over this way the mouth movement is also very odd
[9724.22 --> 9732.86]  yeah it's actually kind of funny how much of recognizing a person is their mannerisms yeah
[9733.82 --> 9740.70]  i also think that their face is probably actually this big like they probably have a wider face
[9741.26 --> 9749.10]  whereas on me this is just hair and i have a narrower face so it ends up looking really weird like
[9749.10 --> 9755.98]  the hair moves like flesh they're like super frozen too like the rest of them doesn't move at all the
[9755.98 --> 9761.26]  shoulders don't even slightly adjust and why wouldn't they use like a low resolution crappy version of
[9761.26 --> 9765.42]  me why would they make it look like i'm sitting in a portrait studio like why would i record that
[9765.42 --> 9769.26]  like the portrait studio is weird i don't know what you're saying in the clip but the portrait food is
[9769.26 --> 9774.78]  uh i think it should have audio there should be a if you push the top right corner top right on corner
[9774.78 --> 9781.10]  oh sure i can't you want to listen to it uh yeah okay it is there uh give me one second yeah oh okay
[9781.10 --> 9786.70]  yeah sure we can hear the audio i think it's supposed to be this one play the terrible audio
[9786.70 --> 9794.06]  apparently it's terrible audio tell me about yourself highly jjurio he's very funny you think i'm a fake
[9794.06 --> 9798.38]  but i'm not hope this video proves i'm not got anything dan can they hear it we can't do it
[9798.38 --> 9807.02]  oh well that's okay i'm kind of over it but i'm not hope this video yeah after dark uh yeah do we
[9807.02 --> 9815.42]  have any other major topics today is there anything else that we announced uh oh lordy what did we
[9815.42 --> 9823.74]  announce oh no this is a good one stop killing games gains ground on official eu response so the
[9823.74 --> 9828.22]  background here if you're not familiar is stop killing games is a movement aimed at restricting
[9828.22 --> 9833.66]  game publishers ability to render games unplayable after purchase they have petitioned to the eu among
[9833.66 --> 9841.18]  others for new legislation regulating how and when publishers can delist and sunset games in june
[9841.18 --> 9845.82]  stop killing games was officially registered by the european commission as a citizens initiative
[9846.46 --> 9853.34]  now if organizers can collect a million statements of support from eu residents within the next year
[9853.34 --> 9861.74]  the eu government will be legally obligated to make an official response this is very cool i think
[9861.74 --> 9866.30]  they'll get it too two members of the eu parliament well if we can do anything about it yeah darn right
[9866.30 --> 9871.66]  they're gonna get it they're only gonna get it if you guys listening to this do sign don't hear me say
[9871.66 --> 9875.66]  like i think they'll get it and not do something yeah i'm saying i think they'll get it because i'm
[9875.66 --> 9880.70]  thinking that you will support it two members of the eu parliament have submitted questions to the european
[9880.70 --> 9884.70]  commission for clarity on whether consumers should be protected from these kinds of publisher actions
[9884.70 --> 9890.14]  under existing eu law the commission's response basically boils down to it's possible but currently
[9890.14 --> 9896.70]  untested that if games eulas are unfair they might be unenforceable consumers should be compensated if
[9896.70 --> 9901.10]  a service or supply of a good is cut off before the end of its agreed contract however these kinds of
[9901.10 --> 9905.98]  decisions probably need to be made first by member states before eu regulators take actions the quote here
[9905.98 --> 9911.42]  uh the question of whether destroying games post purchase is legal has reportedly been escalated to
[9911.42 --> 9917.34]  a high level in the french bureaucracy so this is pretty exciting i was worried this wouldn't gain
[9917.34 --> 9923.34]  any traction whatsoever but it seems like there's a little bit a little bit of snow just just a few flakes
[9923.34 --> 9929.90]  a few flakes of snow maybe moving maybe not rolling yet but moving is there um is there like a
[9929.90 --> 9935.34]  sign up form to sign this now or something i i can't find anything personally
[9937.02 --> 9942.62]  is there something we can direct people to uh i don't know tell you what uh we will find out um
[9942.62 --> 9948.62]  dan if you don't mind making a note for jessica we will find out for you guys for next week and we will
[9948.62 --> 9953.50]  direct you to the right place because if we can get everyone who watches the wan show who lives in the eu
[9953.50 --> 9959.10]  to sign up for this maybe we could even do another special uh early morning wan show like a first thing friday
[9959.10 --> 9964.62]  wan show so we can catch more of them live yeah that'd be cool that'd be cool yeah i'm excited this
[9964.62 --> 9973.42]  is great because realistically if they have to put in the work to hand over the the server tools to
[9973.42 --> 9978.78]  the community or you know do whatever it is then they might as well just hand it over everywhere in
[9978.78 --> 9985.34]  every region rather than just in the eu we see this over and over and over again where one large
[9985.34 --> 9990.94]  jurisdiction basically goes yeah you can't do that and they change their behavior worldwide i'm i'm super
[9990.94 --> 10001.58]  excited um zombie blogs rise from the dead to commit plagiarism didn't we talk about this
[10003.50 --> 10009.90]  oh we talked about sort of this last week not quite the unofficial apple weblog which was closed by aol back
[10009.90 --> 10016.78]  in 2015 has a parent or we blog whatever it is has apparently been revived as a platform for ai
[10016.78 --> 10023.42]  generated articles under the byline of its former writers the articles are blatantly plagiarized having
[10023.42 --> 10028.62]  barely been changed from the original source likewise the writer's bios and profile pictures are ai
[10028.62 --> 10033.42]  generated some of the stolen names have been changed to generic names after the original writers
[10033.42 --> 10039.74]  threatened legal action the domain's new owner web orange limited doesn't appear to have also purchased
[10039.74 --> 10045.34]  the site's old content and instead claims to have had its staff meticulously rewrite that content
[10045.34 --> 10050.86]  based on archived versions available on archive.org web orange is apparently based out of hong kong and
[10050.86 --> 10057.10]  also owns a few other revived old sites such as i lounge which is also now posting low quality ai
[10057.10 --> 10065.98]  generated articles under the supposed byline of human beings ah okay i think that's it other than the ftc
[10065.98 --> 10071.10]  says most websites use dark patterns and a big surprise to everyone who's ever tried to unsubscribe
[10071.10 --> 10077.02]  from anything uh apparently that uh we don't have to get jessica to do the work it's not live yet oh
[10077.02 --> 10082.30]  okay okay it's coming but it's not there yet and apparently canada's doing this too maybe question mark
[10082.30 --> 10086.62]  well that would be exciting yeah i don't i don't think we have notes on that necessarily but
[10086.62 --> 10094.14]  oh yeah if you go to stop killing games.com countries you can see the various flags and there's
[10094.14 --> 10102.14]  the canadian flag and you can sign the petition and do stuff like that very cool okay hey we can
[10102.14 --> 10105.82]  collapse things in the dock now so we should do that with any topics that we've already done that's
[10105.82 --> 10111.26]  going to make it way easier to process this thing oh i see yeah i've collapsed a bunch of stuff
[10111.26 --> 10122.14]  poop psa we've all been hacked um this will be another quick one both at&t and ticketmaster were
[10122.14 --> 10127.26]  um several months ago hackers stole large amounts of data from both at&t and ticketmaster
[10127.26 --> 10133.66]  the at&t breach is apparently extensive and affects nearly all of their customers as well as customers of
[10133.66 --> 10138.94]  other providers that use their network nice the data doesn't include the content of calls and texts but
[10138.94 --> 10144.62]  does include a large amount of call metadata at&t is reportedly working with the fbi to investigate
[10144.62 --> 10149.98]  the situation and the ticketmaster breach likely affects millions of its customers in an email
[10149.98 --> 10154.14]  ticketmaster sent out disclosing the breach i got one it claims the information may have included your
[10154.14 --> 10158.94]  name basic contact information and payment card information such as encrypted credit card or debit
[10158.94 --> 10165.50]  card numbers and expiration dates both breaches are linked to cloud data company snowflake whose servers
[10165.50 --> 10172.22]  were compromised when somebody was too woke i guess i made up the last bit
[10173.74 --> 10177.50]  things got heated yikes should we move to after dark
[10179.34 --> 10183.26]  sure sure what do we want purple now uh sure purple
[10183.26 --> 10189.66]  i lost their name because this conversation was a long time ago but someone did point out in
[10189.66 --> 10197.42]  full plane chat that purple might make it seem like twitch yeah do we care no all right i do think they
[10197.42 --> 10202.78]  might be uh onto something but sure there i think it's okay nice question for you there we go what's up
[10202.78 --> 10209.26]  why don't they just store people's names and email addresses encrypted why is anything stored plain text
[10209.26 --> 10213.50]  oh because they store the credit cards encrypted
[10219.42 --> 10223.82]  maybe this is just me asking a dumb question but it just seems like it wouldn't be that hard for them
[10223.82 --> 10229.90]  to decrypt it when they access it just like anything else uh it might be pretty annoying uh is that my
[10229.90 --> 10236.78]  problem is it like yeah i don't know um how important is just the name
[10238.86 --> 10243.58]  i mean the name itself is not terribly important unless it's an ashley madison leak
[10244.14 --> 10249.98]  um but i would say the name in conjunction with any kind of contact information is gonna
[10250.62 --> 10257.50]  if nothing else increase the incidence of robocalls and spam lookups get really annoying like there's a
[10257.50 --> 10263.58]  lot of things on the company side that's like really annoying for um and honestly in in this
[10263.58 --> 10267.34]  might piss off a lot of privacy people in my opinion it's all leaked already anyways
[10268.62 --> 10274.78]  that definitely made some people mad uh um i will be the voice of reason no that's a bad attitude and
[10274.78 --> 10279.58]  no i don't mean for everything in general we should be just saying just the name no no i'm not saying
[10279.58 --> 10283.58]  just i think it's a little unreasonable to say that we need to just encrypt literally everything all the
[10283.58 --> 10289.66]  time no but we could encrypt um we could in what i'm saying is here i thought you just mentioned
[10289.66 --> 10295.58]  the name i did but i meant the name in conjunction with anything else is a problem so if sure you could
[10295.58 --> 10302.70]  have you could have one thing that is that is not encrypted but then to your point like how do you
[10302.70 --> 10309.26]  how do you search a database then that's really tough it gets pretty annoying um i think there's like
[10309.26 --> 10315.18]  there's a there's an appropriate middle ground on this type of stuff um but like what all leaked
[10315.18 --> 10321.74]  what did they say leaked oh man uh for ticketmaster it was like names contact information and encrypted
[10321.74 --> 10326.14]  credit card numbers so like if my contact information was also encrypted i wouldn't care
[10330.30 --> 10337.02]  like why why do they need to index my contact information other than to like target me with ads or
[10337.02 --> 10343.74]  whatever which i honestly go yourself anyway like i just is there any reason not to just say look
[10344.62 --> 10350.38]  anything that could leak has to be enough of it has to be encrypted that you could not build
[10351.50 --> 10355.82]  an individual profile of a person you couldn't tie any one thing to anyone else i think a lot of it
[10355.82 --> 10365.82]  comes back down to it's expensive and annoying um so it's like a to email you your ticket
[10367.02 --> 10373.02]  you're not going to be able to access to it's not available to you but i don't know if that's true
[10373.02 --> 10377.18]  possible just really annoying um
[10381.34 --> 10386.70]  you decrypt everything else in this case i could be wrong here i don't know if that's true
[10386.70 --> 10402.22]  you have the key exposing in use all the time yeah i don't know um that's true but it and maybe it
[10402.22 --> 10411.50]  would just you know make that particular machine a a more enticing target but like if you only have to
[10411.50 --> 10418.78]  harden a handful of targets versus if just like every csr in the entire company has access to
[10418.78 --> 10423.34]  something like it's i think it's just like this is information that's used to verify people all the time
[10423.34 --> 10429.66]  for a huge variety of reasons and stuff i think it's just really taxing on whatever service it is
[10430.46 --> 10438.86]  um and i'm not necessarily saying that makes it like a good thing but i i understand why that level of
[10438.86 --> 10445.10]  stuff is often not encrypted yeah or like okay here's an interesting one top gear 1224 in the chat
[10445.10 --> 10455.42]  says uh what about encrypting part of things like so so if you need to be able to search by email
[10455.42 --> 10462.38]  uh you could you could encrypt um the domain that would at least obfuscate things a little bit
[10462.38 --> 10468.86]  like could you could you have part of a text field be encrypted on your side people have the same ones
[10469.58 --> 10475.26]  um well you're still only going to get a handful of results like yeah you wouldn't be able to find
[10475.26 --> 10480.30]  an exact match or that's pretty annoying oh that is pretty annoying but they probably wouldn't have
[10480.30 --> 10489.02]  the same name it's really just pretty annoying yeah okay well i i'm just i'm just tired of this
[10489.02 --> 10495.10]  you know yeah like oh no i completely think things the way they are isn't good completely agree
[10495.74 --> 10499.98]  caress i think that's what i'm going to say it is makes each data transaction take longer and over
[10499.98 --> 10505.34]  millions of users can really slow everything down this is a huge deal um and that's why i said cost
[10505.34 --> 10510.38]  more and be very annoying that's effectively what i meant ticket master can afford it they definitely
[10510.38 --> 10518.14]  can you know what ticket master yeah i just like and anytime you add like if you add a single call to
[10518.14 --> 10523.66]  like a task that happens like a bajillion times like there was an inefficiency we found in float
[10523.66 --> 10529.82]  plane a while ago because um it would check if you could watch if i i don't something was configured
[10529.82 --> 10532.94]  incorrectly and honestly i'm going to tell the story wrong because i don't remember because it's been a
[10532.94 --> 10538.86]  long time but it was it was doing like way too many steps when it was checking if you could watch a
[10538.86 --> 10543.58]  video if i remember correctly it was like a drm check of some sort can it was like can you watch all of
[10543.58 --> 10547.74]  the videos and then it would it would i don't remember exactly what it did but it was really
[10547.74 --> 10552.46]  excessive whatever it did and there was a way easier way to simplify it and we did end up simplifying it
[10552.46 --> 10556.38]  but we were trying to figure out like like why are we having scaling issues with this one thing and
[10556.38 --> 10564.14]  we ended up figuring out that like as as users were joining it wasn't like oh you increase it by a
[10564.14 --> 10569.50]  reasonable amount it was like oh every single time someone tries to play a video at all there's like this
[10569.50 --> 10576.38]  massive amount of uh hits to the database all at the same time it was like very unreasonable so you
[10576.38 --> 10582.54]  try to make those things more efficient um and it can be very annoying to not do that grass says i work
[10582.54 --> 10586.70]  with aws and i'm always under pressure to reduce processing time and therefore costs yeah this is
[10586.70 --> 10593.26]  like this is a huge thing this is scary and top gear 1224 says plain text databases are cheap i once
[10593.26 --> 10598.54]  realized i could access the whole customer name email list and phone number for everyone who ever called
[10598.54 --> 10605.02]  at&t back like 10 20 years yep oh my goodness yeah super normal
[10607.74 --> 10612.54]  all right dan want to hit us with some merch messages let me just stop crying over here yeah
[10613.10 --> 10620.38]  i told you computers computers were a mistake yeah we shouldn't have tricked rocks into thinking it's all
[10620.38 --> 10630.06]  been downhill since let's see talking of uh stupid rocks uh lld i have an older gen phone uh samsung 10

[10804.38 --> 10809.90]  of sleep focused earbuds recently thanks for the screwdriver bundle gonna be my new aerospace
[10809.90 --> 10819.10]  maintenance toys sick um i have not every sleep focused earbud or sleep mask or like thing that goes
[10819.10 --> 10826.06]  over here and has speakers built into it that i've ever seen was less comfortable and oftentimes as
[10826.06 --> 10838.22]  expensive or more expensive compared to just airpods and so i've just yet to discover a reason for them to exist um
[10842.30 --> 10847.74]  yeah i've been having a lot of trouble with my airpods pros lately though i have airpods pros to pro twos and
[10848.62 --> 10854.46]  i'm getting this weird issue when connected to my pc where the volume just keeps cranking and then i like turn it
[10854.46 --> 10859.02]  down three notches and then it cranks again but the volume slider doesn't change so i turn it down a bit
[10859.02 --> 10864.22]  more and i get to the point where i'm at like one and it's too loud so i'm at one or zero and it's like
[10864.22 --> 10869.26]  okay thank you very much for that and then i'm having weird reception issues with them too which i never had
[10869.26 --> 10880.62]  before yeah i don't know man anyway hi ldl looking forward to all three of your frosted tips
[10880.62 --> 10887.50]  question for probably luke what is your favorite app for counting macros or calories do you even count
[10887.50 --> 10894.86]  oh and linus congrats on the boobies thank you i think it's called macro factor um
[10895.98 --> 10900.06]  you're gonna have to explain what a macro is to me i have no idea i just swim
[10900.78 --> 10905.98]  or badminton or whatever i just do stuff adam got me on macro factor as well i don't know anything pretty
[10905.98 --> 10912.70]  good yes thanks with my smart watch too yeah um so basically you can look for your like um
[10913.74 --> 10921.02]  protein carb and fat goals for a day within a certain amount of calories and then you log
[10921.02 --> 10928.62]  the food that you eat throughout the day and win and you give it input on what level of exercise you're
[10928.62 --> 10934.38]  doing and it tries to balance your your calories and calories out to match whatever your goal is
[10934.38 --> 10939.10]  gaining weight losing weight maintaining whatever can i just eat when i'm hungry you might be able to
[10939.98 --> 10947.74]  all right cool right now i can't i'll get there cool have you heard that steve-o from jackass just
[10947.74 --> 10959.90]  getting fake boobs i mean i hardly think that that's even like noteworthy these days oh also that
[10964.38 --> 10968.70]  all right next merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch merch
[10969.74 --> 10975.74]  uh hi dll what does lmg incorporated do for sustainability and what do you all think it
[10975.74 --> 10980.46]  will take for the corporations of the world to do their part in preserving the planet
[10982.78 --> 10990.94]  um hold on one sec uh i came up with the idea a few years ago to get a boob job
[10990.94 --> 10994.86]  and just film a bunch of legitimately funny hidden camera pranks with me in disguise
[10995.98 --> 11005.58]  and then revealing who i actually am so he's aware of body suits right yeah like if you want to
[11005.58 --> 11012.38]  be in disguise as someone with breasts you can just wear fake breasts above your skin
[11012.38 --> 11020.62]  and how do these people reach adulthood doesn't isn't that like finster's whole thing i don't know you
[11020.62 --> 11036.62]  gotta commit to the bits uh okay yeah steve-o collab with finster i mean sure mr has real boobs now okay
[11036.62 --> 11046.22]  i don't know who's finster it's a content creator i mean okay is there is there some context for this
[11046.22 --> 11053.10]  or like you know what it doesn't matter they wore a suit thing a suit you were talking the body suit
[11053.10 --> 11057.58]  or whatever yeah they wore one of those for lots of years apparently they have they have them actually
[11057.58 --> 11065.02]  now but oh they wore a suit thing for years okay sure what do you mean linus is out of touch square
[11065.02 --> 11073.82]  i'm not what i don't know i just i i know i wasn't even call you that i i explicitly said in the
[11073.82 --> 11081.02]  beginning of it that it like wasn't even shocking anymore yeah it doesn't matter anyway apparently
[11081.02 --> 11086.14]  finster uh has come out of as full trans now i didn't know but okay that's a thing i guess it
[11086.14 --> 11093.34]  sounds like we had some hints at the leading up to that maybe yeah okay makes sense
[11095.82 --> 11099.98]  i don't know it's just whatever point and laugh at the boomers okay what's next
[11101.26 --> 11106.38]  uh sustainability what does lmg do for sustainability and what do you think it'll take for the corporations
[11106.38 --> 11111.74]  of the world to do their part preserving the planet i'm super anti-plastic we use as little plastic as
[11111.74 --> 11116.54]  humanly possible in the production of our products um i don't think you're ever going to stop people from
[11116.54 --> 11121.74]  like buying stuff so one of the things that we try to do whenever we develop our products is make
[11121.74 --> 11129.74]  things that last for a really long time uh reduce is the first one um we are going to we have and
[11129.74 --> 11134.54]  continue to advocate for upgradable electronics repairable electronics
[11134.54 --> 11144.06]  there's things that we're bad at um it i kind of had a realization that at the scale that we've
[11144.06 --> 11149.26]  reached the number of computer systems and the amount of stuff that we leave on around here
[11149.26 --> 11153.10]  when i tried to change that not even that long ago and you told me i couldn't because people need
[11153.10 --> 11157.90]  to promote into their computers and i was like that seems excessive i don't remember the full context but
[11157.90 --> 11160.94]  depending on what we were talking about i could have conceivably said that
[11161.66 --> 11167.10]  we need to find another solution we were closing up after a wan show and i was realizing how many
[11167.10 --> 11172.62]  people's computers were just on and i was like this seems crazy part of it is that i fought the battle
[11172.62 --> 11178.46]  a lot of times like i would literally go to someone's workstation that was just unlocked and on i'm
[11178.46 --> 11183.66]  pretty sure we could win and i would set it to screen off the it team is now powerful okay that's fair
[11183.66 --> 11190.54]  but i would set it to turn off and then like the next day i would see the same one on i'd be like
[11190.54 --> 11195.10]  what is going on here it would particularly happen with the ingest stations they would keep changing
[11195.10 --> 11199.82]  them back to never go to sleep and i'm like okay i get it if it goes to sleep during a transfer it
[11199.82 --> 11203.50]  might like cause an issue or something so instead of like four hours or something then no transfer is
[11203.50 --> 11211.82]  going to take four hours you could even do like eight coming in the morning use it once it stays
[11211.82 --> 11215.50]  on for the rest of the day and shuts down at least it's going to shut down eventually yeah yeah
[11218.14 --> 11223.02]  hit me down we should do we should and could do more and we'll we want to do more
[11223.74 --> 11228.94]  but i'm also not gonna pretend to set like an arbitrary we're gonna be carbon neutral by wouldn't
[11228.94 --> 11233.10]  yeah like we're just gonna we're gonna do little things that we can we're gonna make things that
[11233.10 --> 11240.54]  last and we're gonna use less plastic yeah hi all from burnaby which entities own all the cable that
[11240.54 --> 11247.90]  connects the world to the internet do they not stand in a position to make the best worst trained llm
[11247.90 --> 11252.46]  also come to langley rib fest owning the cable doesn't mean that you actually have any meaningful
[11252.46 --> 11257.26]  way of harvesting the data that is being transmitted on it a lot of it is encrypted and if you're not at an
[11257.26 --> 11266.38]  end point uh you essentially are not privy to what is passing through that cable necessarily so it's not
[11266.38 --> 11278.22]  really quite that simple hey linus as a serial snob what would be your top three underrated serials um
[11278.78 --> 11287.02]  i wow i um okay serials that are underrated i i don't know what serials are underrated i don't i don't
[11287.02 --> 11295.58]  participate in the serial snob community brand flakes i only brand buds are you a brand enthusiast
[11295.58 --> 11301.42]  dan i'm just thinking of things that people might not like that you may actually like um yeah those
[11301.42 --> 11307.02]  are the two serials that i like i'm not on r slash serial killers you know assuming that that was what
[11307.02 --> 11312.14]  they would call a serial community so yeah that's superb owl and that type of thing possible
[11312.14 --> 11319.74]  it's yeah that's what i would call it um so i i only drink i drink i only eat like mainstream
[11319.74 --> 11325.18]  cereals from like you know kellogg's and post and stuff like i'm honestly not that much of a snob i just
[11326.06 --> 11331.98]  really appreciate okay i'm enough of a snob that i can tell the difference in like manufacturing
[11331.98 --> 11338.06]  tolerances from one batch to the next like when the boxes on the shelf have all been gone and replaced by a
[11338.06 --> 11344.22]  new batch of mini wheats like i can tell that the frosting consistency is lower and the ratio is off
[11344.22 --> 11350.86]  wow so i'm enough of a snob that i'm like that where i will literally stop eating cranberry almond
[11350.86 --> 11357.42]  crunch because it's too crunchy now and they they screwed up the like uh the final glazing or like
[11357.42 --> 11362.54]  roasting component of it i don't know much about how it's made too crunchy i just know that corn pops when
[11362.54 --> 11367.82]  i was in grade eight were freaking awesome up here in canada they're different from the us the us ones
[11367.82 --> 11373.58]  are still good um but the canadian ones were perfectly round like the us ones they're not round
[11374.54 --> 11380.06]  it's you get used to it though okay yeah they're they're good once you like if you were expecting
[11380.94 --> 11388.46]  like early 2000s canadian corn pops yeah the american ones would be sorely disappointing yeah but if
[11388.46 --> 11394.22]  you compare to the american ones to the atrocity that we have now oh no have you not eaten corn pops
[11394.22 --> 11398.54]  in the last 15 years oh they suck i had them when i was a kid yeah they suck they've gone through a
[11398.54 --> 11406.70]  number of phases so they were perfect and then they did something i think i think they um they changed
[11406.70 --> 11412.94]  the like the the sugar outer coating the crunchy coating and they would get soft like immediately and
[11412.94 --> 11417.26]  then they hard corrected the other way to the point where it was like chewing on a mouth full of broken
[11417.26 --> 11424.54]  glass used to like hurt the roof of your mouth yeah that was like prime there was a time where
[11424.54 --> 11430.86]  they hurt too much after the time when they hurt a little and anyway they they basically i haven't
[11430.86 --> 11435.42]  actually had them in a while so it's possible they've dialed it back in and they're good now but
[11435.42 --> 11440.78]  man did they ever suck oh man honey nut cheerios before post went all whole grain and everything
[11440.78 --> 11449.10]  dude so as a kid i would that was my main line i would eat an entire box of honey nut cheerios dry
[11449.10 --> 11454.86]  like i didn't even need milk man they were so good i was definitely into the having it with milk thing
[11454.86 --> 11460.62]  but but those were my those were my main line my mom used to buy those like super family packs nice so
[11460.62 --> 11469.34]  good nice yeah man cheerios it's it's always been funny to me to see marquez with his back in the day
[11469.34 --> 11474.38]  when he was living in his dorm and he had his little cheerios box i was like you don't even know what good
[11474.38 --> 11483.90]  cheerios taste like young man sad sad i weep for the younger so i know to enjoy the high quality cereal of our youth
[11483.90 --> 11491.74]  if if there was if there was a petition that i could start bring back good cereal it would be it
[11491.74 --> 11499.66]  would be bring back white flour cereal there's just like post just stop just it all it's all garbage
[11499.66 --> 11505.74]  and it's terrible for you anyway there's your consumable for ltd store a good cereal yeah i don't
[11505.74 --> 11510.70]  i don't even think you're the cereal's not this could make sense this actually makes more sense
[11510.70 --> 11517.66]  than it has any right to i don't think we could make a cereal that would satisfy me whoa did you
[11517.66 --> 11525.58]  hear that creator warehouse yeah no we couldn't do it so i can tell you guys what i like i'm i'm a i'm
[11525.58 --> 11533.10]  a big mini wheats guy uh sometimes the frosting is not enough sometimes it's too heavy um but you pour
[11533.10 --> 11541.42]  like a third of a bowl a little bit too much milk and like eat it fast and the the the milk's got to
[11541.42 --> 11549.02]  be like like three 3.25 or whatever no skim milk or anything like that because that's gross um but you
[11549.02 --> 11555.02]  get that you get that fatty milk in there like ice cold it's got to be as cold as possible and then
[11555.02 --> 11559.02]  i'll pour like another third of a bowl and then like another third of a bowl i would never pour a full
[11559.02 --> 11563.50]  bowl of mini wheats that's disgusting by the time you get to the end of it it's like it's not good
[11563.50 --> 11567.34]  yeah you might as well have just gotten the big shredded wheat thing and then dump some sugar in
[11567.34 --> 11573.74]  the milk like it's it's soggy it's a soggy mess um what i do like triple berry oatmeal crisp
[11575.26 --> 11584.06]  um i add extra cranberries like my own berries i i love dried like craisins um but what are you reacting to
[11584.06 --> 11595.10]  elijah said i use cream or water with cereal uh what that is genuinely offensive i have eaten
[11595.10 --> 11600.78]  cheerios with water once when i was desperate it was horrible and elijah doesn't know anything
[11601.42 --> 11605.26]  so there's that those are like two sides of the absolute most ridiculous spectrum
[11606.22 --> 11611.50]  i still i still love me some honey nut cheerios honey nut cheerios are still good even though they're
[11611.50 --> 11617.42]  not nearly as good as they used to be the point of the milk isn't to wet it honey nut checks
[11618.62 --> 11625.82]  honey nut checks are a drug and my guilty pleasure like the worst of all the horrible sugar cereals that
[11625.82 --> 11633.98]  i eat nesquik really it's i don't think i've ever had it so good make a cereal i didn't yeah it's little
[11633.98 --> 11638.86]  like chocolate balls i assumed yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like if corn pops were
[11638.86 --> 11646.30]  smaller and chocolate and by the time there is so much chocolate flavor in them that by the time
[11646.30 --> 11651.26]  you're done the bowl especially if you do what i do and eat all the cereals out of it and then
[11651.26 --> 11656.62]  re-pour you are basically drinking chocolate milk that's pretty that's pretty good it's like the worst
[11656.62 --> 11662.86]  thing i i do not indulge that very often especially at my rapidly advancing age i like go lean crunch
[11662.86 --> 11672.94]  never heard of it yeah it's good um used to be a quaker harvest crunch guy actually there that'll be
[11672.94 --> 11680.30]  that'll be my underrated cereal and to your point dan about bran actually a raisin bran guy but same
[11680.30 --> 11688.22]  thing you gotta pour small bowls but but a bowl of raisin bran with the right uh okay with the right
[11688.22 --> 11697.66]  ratio of raisins actually pretty good nice i'm more into like muesli style i've never tried reese
[11697.66 --> 11701.98]  puffs because i'm afraid that i'd never stop eating them you would never stop eating them yeah so i've
[11701.98 --> 11708.06]  i've actually never tried them on purpose i refuse to buy them yeah i mean they're a dessert food
[11708.06 --> 11718.70]  i i like cereal for dessert sometimes yeah uh nokie 1119 in flow plane chat please mention wans

[11761.42 --> 11766.94]  thanks for the screwdriver sale grabbed a few bit sets so it's less of a write-off luke what is your
[11766.94 --> 11769.42]  favorite technology you have gotten for floatplane
[11773.42 --> 11775.82]  you're a tech i've gotten for floatplane
[11777.90 --> 11783.74]  what does that mean i vote the work that they've done on the transcode stack i think that's the
[11783.74 --> 11790.30]  thing you think does that count as getting yeah i think so getting through the work of people that

[11831.42 --> 11837.50]  there's there's tons if we're talking about like our own contributions it's it's very wide reaching
[11837.50 --> 11844.30]  we've made a lot of different things um but yeah it's all very good um hold on i've got one that's
[11844.30 --> 11848.78]  not a merch message here in floatplane chat from kren thoughts on the samsung ring announcement
[11848.78 --> 11855.58]  um it's a ring that's only compatible with a samsung phone yep that's annoying so
[11856.78 --> 11867.18]  go yourself i guess it's 400 see you later okay uh question for lld i just quit my job mid-shift
[11867.18 --> 11872.46]  with no notice at a hospital after being there two months post-college how would you handle being
[11872.46 --> 11881.10]  overworked and under trained where do i go from here what was it like uh i don't know it depends
[11881.10 --> 11887.02]  if you like the thing i think like i enjoyed what we were doing so like it's probably what i would
[11887.02 --> 11891.58]  have wanted to do anyways yeah well okay so let's say you're working at a hospital cleaning up pee and
[11891.58 --> 11896.38]  poo though yeah that's rough yeah um i think did they say they're just out of school was that right
[11896.38 --> 11903.26]  yep yep that's tough because finding out after you finished a program that you don't want to do
[11903.26 --> 11910.78]  that job is a real bummer yeah especially um as far as i know basically all medical education that
[11910.78 --> 11920.30]  would land you in a hospital is really expensive um so i don't know that's tough i'm not i'm not sure
[11920.30 --> 11925.74]  what i would necessarily do or go from there hold on porto says it was not confirmed to only work on
[11925.74 --> 11936.14]  samsung so hopefully that's not true in which case i'm um moderately glad that uh some people
[11936.14 --> 11945.10]  who want that product can have it nice it's out of water it's okay um yeah i don't know it's maybe it
[11945.10 --> 11949.58]  was that hospital maybe try to apply somewhere else but as far as my understanding goes working in a
[11949.58 --> 11955.50]  hospital is hectic and you're overworked and there's crazy hours and that's just sort of how it
[11955.74 --> 11963.10]  how it goes yeah i i wish that wasn't the case that um for sure that seems pretty not cool yeah
[11963.74 --> 11969.58]  beggy says we want more aj on camera he knows his shiz um that's a fun video well i've been trying to
[11969.58 --> 11978.14]  convince aj hey aj if you're watching this why don't you go on camera more yeah huh yeah you ever think of
[11978.14 --> 11988.70]  that huh all right you we even saw he had what you had one core problem that he kept insisting
[11988.70 --> 11993.18]  was actually a core problem and then i really questioned him on it and we ended up googling
[11993.18 --> 11998.14]  some things and figured out that maybe it's not as much of a core problem as we thought it was aj i
[11998.14 --> 12002.14]  didn't even think about that until right now we had a conversation about you moving here today
[12002.14 --> 12008.30]  and i didn't think about that okay this is getting dangerously close to an hr conversation on camera
[12008.30 --> 12015.02]  that's fair luke is a chart's a different company that's maybe not good
[12017.98 --> 12022.38]  please don't sue technically those people use the same hr resources that lmg has it's that's
[12022.38 --> 12029.50]  true it's like actually that's why it's umbrella hr right yeah um okay i can but aj you should you
[12029.50 --> 12033.74]  should move here that'd be very cool yeah that'd be very cool then you can have hr meetings in person
[12038.62 --> 12047.26]  okay both of you need to stop why am i the voice of reason oh man you break sometimes um
[12049.26 --> 12055.50]  all right maybe t is up for another one okay uh you want to cover interesting things are there things the
[12055.50 --> 12060.22]  audience might find interesting that you wouldn't cover because you don't find it interesting yourself
[12061.02 --> 12067.82]  yes um but i think chasing that has also led us to um
[12069.82 --> 12073.98]  cover things that we're just not as interested or passionate about so it's finding a balance
[12073.98 --> 12076.46]  it's gonna hurt yeah we need to find a better balance
[12076.46 --> 12086.86]  yeah hi dll i saw the new backpack that linus was wearing in the taiwan pc giveaway video is there
[12086.86 --> 12093.10]  an eta on that and is it also affected by the same reasons that affected the luxe backpack there's no eta
[12093.10 --> 12101.26]  but no it's not affected by the supplier relations challenges it's affected by um it not being very good
[12102.38 --> 12104.30]  it needs a lot of work
[12106.46 --> 12111.34]  i went are you texting me no oh
[12113.58 --> 12119.98]  hold on one of my taiwan friends just sent me a video what is this oh no okay they just got married
[12119.98 --> 12126.78]  that's cool congrats yeah tell them uh a sizable portion of the internet says congrats
[12127.42 --> 12132.06]  because i'm assuming they they will be doing this i think that's generally how that works
[12132.06 --> 12134.62]  couples dinner next year yep there it goes
[12143.02 --> 12147.66]  i've got do they know this is one interesting thing about linus's badminton friends in taiwan
[12147.66 --> 12153.82]  is they know him from badminton yeah like do they do they even realize this could be a thing that's
[12153.82 --> 12159.98]  happening right now um because you could send me guys of chat he does saying congrats like a year and a
[12159.98 --> 12169.34]  bit ago um well we like had dinner and and talked to what you do and stuff yeah we like talked and stuff
[12169.34 --> 12173.26]  yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna send him i'll send him a picture of chat right now cool here we go
[12173.26 --> 12176.14]  it's fun
[12180.94 --> 12188.22]  my live stream says congrats all right what else we got sure uh hi wang wondering what's up with
[12188.22 --> 12194.46]  the headphones.com partnership with audio testing did the labs testing not work out did you find they
[12194.46 --> 12203.26]  were basically already doing what you were planning um we are still working on internal testing we are
[12203.26 --> 12208.62]  always appreciative of external partners like headphones.com those guys are super cool i actually
[12208.62 --> 12214.78]  met one of those folks uh uh buddy's name is blaine he came up and shot a video with us at my house
[12214.78 --> 12221.98]  earlier this week we were trying out this wild sound bar it's called the nakamichi dragon what a name it's a
[12221.98 --> 12228.46]  four thousand dollar sound bar that's a that's a large sum but it comes with surround speakers
[12229.10 --> 12237.18]  so it's not just a sound bar two subwoofers so it is not a sound bar and it weighs as much as a child
[12237.90 --> 12244.78]  uh it's it's freaking crazy the complete package i think weighs about 160 pounds that's a very large
[12244.78 --> 12250.14]  child yeah well that i meant the sound bar weighs as much as a child okay yeah so it's it's pretty it's
[12250.14 --> 12256.06]  pretty cool and anyway they they came up to um to work with us on it and uh help with some recording
[12256.06 --> 12262.14]  and stuff so expect to see expect to see our audio coverage continue to evolve i guess at one time i
[12262.14 --> 12268.22]  was a child that weighed 160 pounds but i was a fairly large child so that makes sense we're all still
[12268.22 --> 12273.42]  kids at heart i was thinking back and i was like yeah i was a child and i weighed that much maybe that's
[12273.42 --> 12278.30]  not as crazy back in my day i was a child mine is hilarious that was the emoji that he sent me back
[12278.30 --> 12284.30]  for that yeah the animation whatever they are i don't know what to call them yeah yeah the reaction
[12285.18 --> 12294.86]  yeah cool a couple more for you here best screwdrivers working on my jdm subaru sg5 forester with it right
[12294.86 --> 12305.18]  now nice luke what cards what cars did you drift in on your japan trip oh no you don't remember cringe
[12305.18 --> 12311.02]  nissan z was the one that i was drifting i'm trying to remember
[12313.74 --> 12319.26]  i know i know he just calls it the chaser um but that's the one that i was riding in that that sam
[12319.26 --> 12327.74]  it was driving um is that the actual name of the i think so wow this thing looks cool sorry the nissan
[12327.74 --> 12335.26]  z this thing looks cool yeah sorry i'm just shopping right now for cars well i don't know no no no no
[12335.26 --> 12341.42]  no i'm just sure fine whatever i don't think it was like a new one to be clear no no by shopping i mean
[12341.42 --> 12349.10]  i'm like looking like like i'm not i'm not buying a car i'm just looking hmm would you use the
[12349.10 --> 12353.82]  word shopping if you had no intention to buy yeah window shopping window shopping yeah all right
[12353.82 --> 12359.10]  uh but yeah the the chase it's actually called the chaser the toyota chaser so i was right i just
[12359.10 --> 12363.74]  wasn't sure if that was what he called it and then i remember that was actually the model name i'm just
[12363.74 --> 12369.74]  i don't think we have toyota chasers here so i forgot um but yeah that was the one that i was a
[12369.74 --> 12378.54]  passenger in got it and then i actually drove the z cool and it was fantastic very cool
[12379.90 --> 12386.06]  hi guys do you see a problem with developers who perform well and do not want to advance positions
[12386.06 --> 12393.66]  i'm happy as a developer team lead about nine years from retirement i'm annually pressured to set goals
[12394.54 --> 12403.58]  developer team lead is a developer who advanced their position just to be clear um but also no i don't
[12403.58 --> 12408.78]  think so not everyone wants to manage and that's fine i can understand why they pressure you to
[12408.78 --> 12415.50]  manage because finding developers who are willing to develop their management skills can be turns out
[12415.50 --> 12423.74]  that's tough it turns out that a lot of introverts find their way to development and a lot of people that
[12423.74 --> 12430.38]  started doing something as difficult as software development probably got into it because they want to
[12430.38 --> 12434.78]  do software development um and not necessarily because they want to manage so like this all this
[12434.78 --> 12444.46]  all makes sense to me um that being said there are some people that uh are on my team that i've kind of
[12444.46 --> 12451.90]  nudged to be like hey are you interested in that could be helpful um and they have generally expressed that
[12451.90 --> 12457.42]  they are not uh there's someone at yeah eblx as a dev manager i want to go back to being a dev
[12457.42 --> 12466.70]  uh yeah i'm not surprised um so i don't know for most people i would suggest to consider it just because
[12466.70 --> 12472.38]  it's a pretty desired position um but if you're not into managing people and you just want to keep
[12472.38 --> 12477.50]  doing development i there's a ton of respect to that you need really talented experienced developers
[12477.50 --> 12484.38]  to be leading things very often and i don't think that the end scale of everything should be management um
[12484.38 --> 12495.34]  personally so that is what it is dll what are your thoughts on the current 13th and 14th gen intel kks
[12495.34 --> 12501.58]  situation being far bigger than simple bias or microcode updates meaning the problem is baked in
[12501.58 --> 12509.02]  how does intel solve this via recalls i think that they are up the creek without a paddle the fact that
[12509.02 --> 12515.26]  these chips are um because what like if you recall the chip and then what are they what does that
[12515.26 --> 12520.78]  person do with the rest of their system the fact that these top spec chips are impacted while the lower
[12522.14 --> 12530.70]  down versions are not to me is indicative that intel has pushed things too far what they can possibly do
[12530.70 --> 12538.86]  to get themselves out of this situation honestly i'm not i'm i am not sure obviously they need to
[12538.86 --> 12549.02]  replace every chip that dies um but i think that if you were to say something like every cpu that
[12549.02 --> 12554.94]  causes a system blue screen should be immediately rma'd you'd be laughed out of town because there's so
[12554.94 --> 12560.70]  many factors that i think nailing this down to the cpu being the defect is going to be really difficult and
[12560.70 --> 12564.94]  confusing for a lot of end users so how do they solve this
[12567.66 --> 12572.78]  i mean some kind of recall mechanism seems like it's going to be necessary
[12572.78 --> 12577.34]  at some point here unless they can figure out a way to fix this remotely um
[12581.02 --> 12585.74]  this is uh yeah this is a big this is a big challenge
[12585.74 --> 12589.98]  biggie says they biggie says they could take the apple root and ignore the issue
[12590.62 --> 12595.50]  i don't know if they're going to be able to i i think they will you think so i do that's what i
[12595.50 --> 12601.42]  suspect they're going to do a lot of loud noise being made there's a lot of loud noise being made in
[12601.42 --> 12609.66]  an extremely small teacup that's fair and to in the in the grand scheme of things intel could just stop
[12609.66 --> 12617.98]  making k-chips all together tomorrow and it wouldn't really we it would be it would be a notable item
[12617.98 --> 12624.70]  on their quarterly investment call um and they would say yeah we've made some divestment from the
[12624.70 --> 12630.70]  sort of enthusiast overclockable we're focusing on enterprise more stock go up we're yeah we're
[12630.70 --> 12635.98]  focusing on we're focusing on uh you know aipcs through our tier one partners and oems like it's
[12639.66 --> 12645.74]  it's rough not the greatest time to be a pc person that's what i think is going to happen
[12645.74 --> 12652.38]  and um oh you think they're going to stop making k-chips no no i i think i think that they would do
[12652.38 --> 12657.50]  that before recalling all of two generations of k-chips yeah i think they'd just be like screw it
[12657.50 --> 12662.06]  forget it i don't think we'll see a recall i also think a recall would honestly piss people off because
[12662.06 --> 12671.26]  um they built the computer around this thing it would also draw way more attention to it than
[12671.26 --> 12676.62]  probably it would ever have any chance of getting through just us talking about it um
[12677.82 --> 12682.78]  other tech channels talking about it hopefully he's talking about it hopefully wendell's recent dive um
[12684.70 --> 12688.78]  here's on level one text right where is it
[12692.06 --> 12696.54]  intel has a pretty big problem on level one text from wendell two days ago yeah if you guys want to
[12696.54 --> 12701.66]  check it out go uh go watch it also this is like a minor aside but wendell's hosting in this video is
[12701.66 --> 12711.66]  also fantastic i just want to say that yeah i love wendell fantastic video and last one i've got for you
[12711.66 --> 12718.06]  tonight aloha lld i recently moved to hawaii as my partner got stationed in pearl harbor from the navy
[12718.06 --> 12723.58]  my tower is still mainland and i'm worried it won't survive the shipping you should be
[12724.14 --> 12730.06]  any tips mahalo take the gpu out yeah that's a big one we actually did a whole video on this
[12730.78 --> 12735.02]  uh how to ship your computer
[12738.62 --> 12741.18]  apparently jay's two cents also did a video on it
[12741.18 --> 12746.86]  but i'm gonna link you to this one got him
[12751.66 --> 12758.22]  and i think that's pretty much it we will see you guys again next week same bad time same bad
[12758.22 --> 12762.38]  channel enjoy your screwdrivers a bunch of you bought gift cards this week oh that makes sense
[12762.38 --> 12770.14]  because lime day is coming up so you're just buying gift cards yeah i see you tactical strategic
[12774.22 --> 12777.10]  did you say your bit yeah oh bye
[12782.06 --> 12785.10]  happy anniversary everyone yeah
[12785.10 --> 12794.86]  happy birthday
