[0.00 → 4.70] What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show!
[4.82 → 7.82] We've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today.
[8.00 → 8.18] Yeah.
[8.34 → 12.38] I forget what our headline topic was, so I guess Luke's going to take it.
[13.38 → 15.38] This is wild.
[16.60 → 20.28] A US appeals court has sided with music publishing giants
[20.28 → 27.18] saying that ISPs should refuse service to users who are suspected of piracy.
[27.36 → 29.24] Someone's going to get their parents pretty mad.
[29.24 → 36.52] In other news, your vacuum is watching you and blasting out racial epithets.
[37.24 → 37.82] Oh, what?
[38.00 → 38.50] Oh, yeah.
[38.60 → 39.66] No, it's a whole thing.
[39.86 → 41.18] I didn't know that part.
[41.28 → 41.62] Yeah.
[41.82 → 43.48] No, it's not good.
[43.68 → 44.26] Oh, boy.
[44.40 → 47.50] No, the manufacturer thinks it's okay, but no one else does.
[48.00 → 52.78] Speaking of things that are bad in some ways, are we moving?
[54.76 → 56.34] Are we moving?
[56.66 → 58.60] We could talk about the feasibility of that.
[58.60 → 59.16] Yeah.
[59.26 → 62.06] Also, you can talk to your dog now.
[62.68 → 63.12] Yeah!
[63.80 → 65.42] You can talk to your dog!
[65.82 → 66.84] You can talk to your dog!
[66.90 → 67.36] With AI.
[67.68 → 68.02] Yay!
[68.02 → 96.78] The show is brought to you today by Acronis, Squarespace, MSI, and of course, our chair partner, Secret Lab, our laptop partner, LG,
[96.78 → 103.14] and our rap partner, D Brand, who wrapped our table and wrapped my phone and wrapped...
[103.14 → 103.42] Your car.
[104.32 → 104.76] Yeah.
[105.00 → 105.34] Yeah.
[105.40 → 106.50] They just wrap things.
[107.62 → 111.20] They don't like melodious singing.
[111.46 → 112.46] They've never wrapped you.
[112.56 → 113.16] They just wrap.
[113.34 → 113.64] Oh, wow.
[114.60 → 114.90] Nice.
[115.14 → 116.10] Does rap not have melodies?
[116.32 → 116.56] Nice.
[116.56 → 117.76] I mean, yeah, I can.
[118.00 → 118.14] Oh.
[118.28 → 119.00] That's not the point.
[119.06 → 125.84] The point is that Luke thought this was the headline topic, which I find actually really
[125.84 → 127.02] interesting because...
[127.02 → 127.70] Well, it's interesting to me.
[128.46 → 129.80] We've kind of...
[129.80 → 130.56] Do you want to...
[130.56 → 131.38] You want to...
[131.38 → 134.68] Should I pull back the curtain and let them know why I thought this would be a good headline
[134.68 → 135.02] topic?
[135.02 → 138.40] What's the point of even having curtains anyway, right?
[138.48 → 139.90] Do they even match the carpet?
[140.20 → 141.02] Like, just...
[142.18 → 142.88] Not right now.
[144.14 → 145.12] Um, I mean...
[145.12 → 145.48] Same.
[147.70 → 148.14] Wow.
[148.26 → 148.88] This was quick.
[149.28 → 149.96] Um...
[149.96 → 152.22] And...
[152.22 → 153.02] Goodbye, rails.
[153.02 → 154.30] Uh...
[154.30 → 156.02] Anyway.
[156.80 → 158.22] No, it just seemed cliquey.
[159.30 → 159.70] Okay.
[160.00 → 161.82] It's also, like, an actual discussion.
[162.18 → 162.52] Yeah.
[162.70 → 164.12] Well, that was it.
[164.18 → 165.46] That was your curtain pulling back?
[165.70 → 165.94] Yeah.
[166.66 → 167.06] Jeez.
[167.16 → 167.86] It seemed cliquey.
[167.92 → 171.68] Remind me not to camp outside your apartment with binoculars because I'm not going to see
[171.68 → 172.24] anything.
[172.72 → 173.08] It's...
[173.08 → 174.50] Um...
[174.50 → 174.98] Okay.
[176.34 → 177.94] Apparently, I'd see some stuff.
[181.78 → 187.52] So, what I told Luke we could do on this show, what I said we could do was we could go
[187.52 → 191.56] through the exercise of why it's really difficult for us to move.
[191.56 → 198.34] Because it's been a pain point for us for basically the last probably three years.
[198.44 → 199.36] Since we got the lab.
[199.50 → 204.18] We've known that we were growing out of this space that we're in right now, which is the
[204.18 → 205.30] old everything.
[205.60 → 206.82] You know, studio, office.
[207.20 → 207.38] Uh...
[207.38 → 209.08] So, we expanded on the one side.
[209.16 → 210.48] We expanded on the other side.
[210.68 → 211.84] We hit a wall there.
[211.94 → 213.82] There's a neighbour that's not selling.
[213.92 → 214.46] So, that's it.
[214.60 → 215.66] This is where we are here.
[215.66 → 220.98] And then we expanded to another unit elsewhere in our complex for Creator Warehouse, who handles
[220.98 → 221.44] all the merch.
[221.98 → 222.34] Um...
[222.34 → 226.40] And then finally, we were like, okay, well, this is it.
[226.46 → 231.48] We either need to kind of separate our operations and have different departments and different
[231.48 → 233.66] buildings, kind of like we did with Creator Warehouse.
[233.66 → 238.64] Or we need to consolidate into one gigantic building.
[238.64 → 244.56] And the gigantic building was going to be really, really expensive.
[244.56 → 249.76] Not just because it's expensive to buy a building, but because the building you're going to get
[249.76 → 253.86] is going to cost an absolute fortune to build out the way that we do.
[253.86 → 258.72] And there just aren't actually really that many buildings at that size.
[258.82 → 260.70] Is what I said back then.
[261.24 → 261.78] Oh, is there?
[261.80 → 265.36] But the market has softened a lot here in Vancouver.
[265.72 → 266.54] I mean...
[266.54 → 267.28] There's...
[267.28 → 269.62] Remember, I'm talking industrial.
[269.94 → 270.84] I'm talking commercial.
[271.06 → 271.62] It's...
[271.62 → 271.84] Right?
[272.12 → 272.64] Still.
[272.94 → 274.38] Well, let's have a look.
[274.60 → 274.84] Okay.
[274.90 → 280.02] Let's go through the exercise that I go through every time I'm looking at commercial real estate.
[280.02 → 285.06] And I'll talk about some of the things that can be really sort of appealing and some of
[285.06 → 290.26] the things that can be really challenging and why it's so hard to find something that's
[290.26 → 291.10] the right fit.
[291.68 → 294.16] Because like for some context for viewers too, right?
[294.26 → 295.36] Like we have...
[295.36 → 300.32] If you think about the production team for videos, that is pretty fragmented right now.
[300.66 → 304.22] Literally none of the teams that might work together are actually close to each other.
[304.44 → 309.72] Even if it's writing in labs, you're at opposite ends of the building and there's a big set
[309.72 → 312.26] of stairs and many sets of doors in between.
[312.64 → 315.82] And it's very likely if you're going through those doors, you're disturbing somebody in
[315.82 → 316.42] some department.
[316.90 → 319.86] So it's like not really that small of a walk.
[319.98 → 325.08] If you're either labs or writing, and you're talking to editing, well, I mean, that's now
[325.08 → 326.78] a 10-minute walk or a two-minute drive.
[328.24 → 329.64] How do we solve this?
[329.76 → 333.28] Well, the Lego pieces don't really click together very well.
[334.14 → 336.90] There isn't a lot of office space in the labs building.
[336.90 → 340.84] There isn't enough space in general in the studio buildings.
[341.04 → 343.28] Parking is a nightmare at either one of them.
[343.62 → 346.90] It's just like, okay, anyway.
[347.78 → 354.52] Now, in fairness to us, it did look like the best solution for expansion at the time because
[354.52 → 361.92] building out something the way that sort of I expect us to do it for our team is really,
[361.92 → 362.64] really expensive.
[362.64 → 368.32] And that adds a lot to the cost of sort of abandoning what we've got here and then consolidating
[368.32 → 368.84] somewhere else.
[368.84 → 375.94] For example, in the lower mainland, so in our area, it is way abnormal, basically unheard
[375.94 → 382.40] of unless you are like a food distribution company to have HVAC in your warehouse.
[382.40 → 389.96] So the fact that we have heat, yes, because it can't be so cold that devices stop working
[389.96 → 390.82] properly or whatever.
[391.06 → 396.62] But having air conditioning in a warehouse space, pretty much unheard of in this area.
[396.78 → 400.70] Whereas all of our warehouse spaces are heated and cooled.
[401.16 → 405.24] So that, you know, because we're not really using them in a warehouse capacity, and we don't
[405.24 → 408.78] really have like just warehouse people.
[408.78 → 412.10] I mean, I don't know, I say that we don't just have warehouse people working in them,
[412.16 → 414.24] but I honestly, I don't think that's a good excuse either.
[414.34 → 416.36] I think warehouses should probably be climate controlled.
[416.56 → 420.24] Sometimes like, like if you're a forklift driver, you might have like a fan mounted on
[420.24 → 420.84] the forklift.
[420.88 → 421.20] Sure.
[421.30 → 421.96] Stuff like that.
[421.98 → 422.38] Like that.
[422.72 → 423.34] Doesn't make you.
[423.50 → 423.92] Blows.
[427.16 → 427.52] Nice.
[427.74 → 428.34] That's pretty good.
[428.92 → 432.22] Basically, what I'm trying to say is I don't really care who you are or how much money
[432.22 → 432.62] you make.
[432.70 → 433.88] You're, you're worth air conditioning.
[433.88 → 438.88] When it's cooked, when we have things called heat domes, and you're in a big metal box,
[439.26 → 440.22] it'd be nice to be able to cool down.
[440.22 → 445.00] Now, in fairness to a lot of the building owners and business owners in the Vancouver
[445.00 → 449.40] area, it hasn't really been a problem until probably about the last five or six years.
[449.92 → 453.78] Like we used to have like one hot week of freaking summer.
[454.10 → 458.02] And so whatever, we're going to install tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars
[458.02 → 459.80] worth of air conditioning for like that one week.
[459.80 → 461.18] No, probably not.
[461.56 → 466.74] But we've made the plunge, which means that any building we move into, we have to put
[466.74 → 469.76] stuff like that into it, which adds a lot to the build out cost.
[469.86 → 473.46] So let's take a look and let's, let's talk about, you know, some of, some of the challenges
[473.46 → 474.16] that we run into.
[474.34 → 479.18] So Collier's is one of the sites that, you know, probably makes sense to use if you're
[479.18 → 480.50] looking for commercial real estate.
[480.88 → 481.00] Sure.
[481.34 → 482.02] Let's have a look.
[482.14 → 482.42] Ooh.
[482.66 → 485.00] Ooh, there's the look at this.
[485.32 → 486.60] See, this is what I'm talking about, Luke.
[486.60 → 491.80] When I would have pulled up this map, let's say, let's say two years ago.
[491.96 → 492.74] There would have been nothing.
[493.00 → 494.32] There would have been flipping.
[494.88 → 497.20] This is such a terrible interface.
[497.36 → 501.12] Can you guys like be slightly, have slightly less of a crappy website?
[501.12 → 501.84] Realty websites are brutal.
[502.14 → 502.42] Yeah.
[502.60 → 503.20] They're so bad.
[503.20 → 506.82] I have always thought like, you know, if we could, if we could go back and instead of
[506.82 → 509.24] making float plane, we should just make like realty software.
[509.52 → 510.50] I know, right?
[510.52 → 514.52] They pay so much for it, and it's so bad.
[514.52 → 517.32] It's kind of crazy.
[517.64 → 518.32] Freaking wild.
[518.44 → 518.64] Okay.
[518.88 → 522.88] So this is kind of the area that we'd be looking at.
[522.92 → 524.18] So here's where the office is now.
[524.76 → 530.26] And most of the team is living in, you know, kind of, these are the urban centres.
[530.26 → 532.78] You can tell from the white instead of the green.
[532.86 → 534.48] Green is like for grass and trees and whatnot.
[534.94 → 538.26] So you're going to have people living in kind of Maple Ridge, kind of Langley.
[538.26 → 544.68] Not too many people down in South Surrey, just because that's like the bogie area of the
[544.68 → 547.00] not the actual city, city over here.
[547.08 → 549.12] It's like the, the bogie burn.
[549.46 → 552.78] Oh, wait, you mean like potentially like employees, or what do you?
[553.10 → 553.26] Yeah.
[553.26 → 553.36] Yeah.
[553.36 → 553.58] Okay.
[553.58 → 553.80] Yeah.
[554.04 → 555.48] So there's a bunch of people in South Surrey.
[555.54 → 556.18] It's just really expensive.
[556.38 → 556.62] Yeah.
[556.62 → 562.48] I'm talking about like where people who commute to this office here are generally going to
[562.48 → 566.12] be coming from a little bit of Coquitlam, a little bit of Burnaby, a little bit of like
[566.12 → 567.00] further West.
[567.12 → 573.68] But the more we were to move an office kind of this way into Burnaby Marine Drive or like
[573.68 → 577.04] Richmond or something like that, the more expensive housing is going to get.
[577.50 → 578.42] And the warehouse.
[578.64 → 579.66] We have found that.
[579.66 → 580.40] Yeah, that too.
[580.74 → 583.74] So we found that this is a this is a pretty good middle ground.
[583.74 → 587.96] If we could be more like here, that might be better, but okay.
[588.04 → 591.36] Let's, so let's, you're very nicely close to the highway just to give some people some
[591.36 → 591.96] context there.
[592.18 → 592.38] Yeah.
[592.38 → 594.78] The this is Canada's only road.
[595.02 → 595.24] Yeah.
[595.34 → 596.60] This is the TransCanada Highway.
[596.78 → 599.40] That's, that's the road everyone memes about when they're talking about Canada.
[599.48 → 599.64] Yeah.
[599.68 → 603.50] So being close to that is generally efficient for most people.
[604.18 → 604.48] Okay.
[604.56 → 606.10] So let's, let's have a look.
[606.38 → 607.88] This is, this is what's in this area.
[607.96 → 608.58] This is hilarious.
[608.58 → 613.58] The first one that comes up is of course the court ordered sale for the, uh,
[613.58 → 616.60] the aspirational mall in Surrey.
[616.74 → 618.38] So wait, Newlands is for sale.
[618.52 → 618.84] Yeah.
[618.96 → 620.72] Newlands golf and country club is for sale.
[620.94 → 621.00] What?
[621.26 → 621.62] Dude.
[621.96 → 622.36] Okay.
[622.70 → 631.12] What if we, what if we, what if we could bring like telemetry golfing data and like,
[631.18 → 632.78] what if we made a high-tech golf course?
[632.86 → 633.06] Okay.
[633.16 → 633.44] Luke.
[633.54 → 634.64] And had an office there.
[634.64 → 635.36] Get this.
[635.90 → 643.50] The combined, the combined estimated value of creator warehouse, the studio and the lab,
[643.58 → 647.96] is probably in the neighbourhood of around 25 to $30 million.
[648.74 → 649.02] Okay.
[649.20 → 649.52] Okay.
[650.18 → 650.86] Get this.
[650.94 → 653.66] How much do you think Newlands golf and country club is worth?
[653.98 → 656.60] It is 111 acres.
[656.74 → 657.36] A hundred and.
[657.42 → 659.76] With 90,000 square feet of building.
[659.88 → 664.30] To, to, to put this for some context, we're in about 40,000 square feet combined.
[664.72 → 667.30] What do you think Newlands golf and country club is worth?
[667.48 → 668.88] That's like pretty nice building.
[668.88 → 670.70] And there's like kitchen on site.
[670.70 → 672.42] I'm assuming that has a cost.
[672.48 → 673.78] I'm assuming they're not just ripping that out.
[675.78 → 676.38] Oh, I know.
[676.50 → 677.22] I'm not going to look at chat.
[677.46 → 677.64] Uh.
[677.64 → 677.74] Yeah.
[677.74 → 678.36] Don't look at chat.
[678.44 → 678.98] Don't look at chat.
[679.04 → 679.80] They're going to help you cheat.
[680.40 → 683.16] My first hunch is like 350.
[683.72 → 684.12] 350.
[684.12 → 684.56] What?
[684.72 → 684.92] Mid.
[685.56 → 686.36] 350 mid.
[686.42 → 686.64] Really?
[687.06 → 687.88] Try 40.
[688.48 → 688.88] 40.
[689.08 → 689.32] What?
[690.32 → 691.08] So what do you think?
[691.30 → 692.42] We move LMG.
[692.44 → 693.24] Let's buy Newlands.
[693.28 → 695.00] To Newlands golf and country club.
[695.10 → 696.38] Wait, how is it actually?
[696.76 → 698.26] Is there something going on with it?
[698.72 → 700.12] Dude, I have no idea.
[700.20 → 702.22] Because how is it multiple times bigger than ours?
[702.32 → 704.32] The facilities are like really nice.
[707.90 → 708.74] Oh man.
[708.88 → 709.18] What?
[709.26 → 710.24] How is it so cheap?
[710.34 → 711.02] I have no idea.
[711.02 → 711.32] With that much land.
[711.32 → 717.34] So there's like I said, there's some stuff going on in the Vancouver area right now.
[717.34 → 719.80] How do you get 112 acres?
[720.34 → 722.76] Some of the big money I think is moving.
[722.82 → 723.36] Is it zoning?
[723.70 → 724.64] Is moving out.
[724.86 → 725.08] Okay.
[725.20 → 726.06] So we'll talk about that.
[726.22 → 731.38] Some of the big money though is moving out of Vancouver real estate because of some of
[731.38 → 739.70] the recent changes that the Trudeau administration has made to the way that taxes on capital
[739.70 → 740.30] gains work.
[740.30 → 747.24] So there has been like an emergency fire sale of some very high value assets.
[747.44 → 751.46] And there's only so many buyers for a 40 million.
[751.62 → 754.28] So for context, that's about 30 million US dollars.
[754.50 → 757.36] A little less like 29 or something like that.
[757.36 → 758.66] Dude, golf pond cooled computer.
[759.16 → 759.72] Right?
[760.60 → 762.32] How fun would that be?
[762.36 → 763.56] Gaming PC in your golf cart?
[763.62 → 765.38] We could overclock one of the...
[765.38 → 766.90] Oh no, you don't do that with golf.
[767.00 → 767.40] Never mind.
[768.18 → 768.66] Okay.
[768.66 → 770.66] I was thinking baseball, like when it shoots the...
[771.38 → 772.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[772.72 → 780.00] So part of this is that it does seem like there's a bit of bubble bursting going on.
[780.14 → 780.30] Yeah.
[780.30 → 783.06] I think that part of it is a demographic shift.
[783.06 → 784.42] So you've got...
[784.42 → 790.70] Because realistically, I'm probably one of the few people in my cohort that is like running
[790.70 → 795.98] a small to medium, you know, like a business of this size.
[796.28 → 796.42] Yeah.
[796.52 → 799.92] You know, most of the businesses in our area are run by boomers.
[799.92 → 800.36] Boomers.
[800.36 → 801.90] And what's happening with boomers?
[803.14 → 804.06] They're retiring.
[804.68 → 805.06] Right?
[805.26 → 812.92] So when you retire, you either are looking to sell your business and retain the asset
[812.92 → 815.24] and keep collecting rent from it as like your pension.
[815.24 → 821.96] Or you're looking to sell the building, take a big bucket of cash, spend it on, you know,
[822.02 → 822.74] some other crap.
[822.86 → 824.42] Give some of it to your kids.
[824.84 → 828.10] Spend some of it on like a lakefront property over on the island.
[828.50 → 828.90] You know, whatever.
[829.02 → 832.90] You want the big bucket of cash, and then you keep running the business for your pocket money.
[833.14 → 835.68] Instead of hookers and blow, it's like cruise ships and painkillers.
[838.34 → 838.74] Sorry.
[839.56 → 840.14] I'm just trying.
[843.16 → 843.74] That's good.
[844.04 → 844.36] Thank you.
[844.56 → 844.58] Thank you.
[844.98 → 848.42] Or you're selling both pieces, and you're just like, screw it.
[848.46 → 851.60] This is so much of a nest egg that I'm a sit on this nest egg forever.
[852.02 → 852.18] Yeah.
[852.18 → 852.36] Yeah.
[852.66 → 855.30] So I think there's some of that happening as well.
[855.30 → 859.08] And then the other big one that you already touched on is zoning.
[859.30 → 861.08] So this right here.
[861.28 → 862.02] Why am I on that?
[862.18 → 862.72] Just me, Kim.
[862.72 → 869.88] This is zoned essentially for operating as a golf course.
[870.22 → 870.38] Yeah.
[870.56 → 874.98] So I didn't think about it because I was trying to think of the acreage because that amount of acreage here,
[875.10 → 880.20] if you turn that into five-story walk-ups, infinite money.
[880.82 → 881.46] Oh, for sure.
[881.54 → 884.76] And to be clear, there is some development potential.
[884.76 → 890.32] You can see there's about six acres of non-agricultural land reserve.
[890.32 → 893.20] So that means you basically can't do jack with it.
[893.34 → 900.92] Like you could buy a 50-acre farm for less than like a one-acre residential lot in some cases.
[901.02 → 901.10] Okay.
[901.18 → 901.80] Not quite.
[902.08 → 915.02] But the point is that this agricultural land reserve land is worth functionally nothing compared to something that you could actually build residential or build industrial or commercial on.
[915.64 → 917.98] There's a lot of other red flags here.
[918.66 → 919.70] Landmark status.
[920.32 → 921.74] Oh, no.
[921.98 → 922.48] What does that mean?
[922.54 → 924.50] You don't want anything with status.
[925.14 → 926.74] You don't want heritage status.
[926.88 → 927.22] Fair enough.
[927.64 → 928.48] Landmark status.
[928.82 → 930.24] I've heard of heritage status.
[930.36 → 930.94] I don't know.
[931.22 → 933.38] I don't know what landmark status is.
[933.50 → 934.28] I don't care.
[934.42 → 935.22] I don't want to know.
[935.42 → 936.50] That sounds terrible.
[937.00 → 946.62] Basically, it means there's red tape that you're going to have to jump through if you want to do anything other than sit in the office there and run a golf course.
[947.02 → 947.18] Okay.
[947.20 → 947.64] What'd you find?
[947.74 → 948.18] What'd you find?
[948.18 → 949.96] Historic place.
[949.96 → 958.70] I haven't got anything specific yet, but the first Google brings you to historic place, which I'm assuming is essentially the same thing as heritage status.
[958.70 → 960.54] Yeah, you don't want any of that.
[960.62 → 961.52] You don't want any part of that.
[961.58 → 961.74] Okay.
[961.80 → 965.64] So we're not buying a golf course because, you know, well, it's stupid, basically.
[967.16 → 968.10] What else we got?
[968.16 → 968.92] What else we got here?
[968.98 → 969.14] Okay.
[969.18 → 973.62] So, yeah, we're not buying the city block in Surrey that's been rotting since the 90s.
[973.62 → 974.82] We talked about that last week.
[975.12 → 976.96] You're going to find a lot of stuff that's for lease.
[977.96 → 981.16] And the thing is, leasing, yeah, it's an option.
[981.16 → 990.78] If you can afford to buy, though, the fact that we have owned this has saved us literally.
[991.68 → 992.16] Literally.
[992.36 → 993.28] I've liked that approach.
[993.38 → 994.64] I've supported that approach the whole time.
[994.64 → 1003.58] Literally millions of dollars because your landlord, in the time since we bought the first three units, we paid a million dollars for three units.
[1004.12 → 1010.70] One of those units is now worth about 1.1 or something like 1.2.
[1010.78 → 1019.38] It's essentially quadrupled in value, which means that if we had leased it, our rent would have quadrupled putting money in the pocket of our landlord.
[1019.38 → 1025.54] When instead, we were able to invest that money in our own equity that we can now use to cross shop something else.
[1025.66 → 1035.72] So, if you can afford to buy, I'd like to buy, even though, with that said, the market is, you know, not going too great right now.
[1036.38 → 1037.20] Sorry, one sec.
[1037.48 → 1044.18] Lomax in Philippine Chat said, we pay half a million dollars a year for our business property in Port Cells, for our lease of our business property in Port Cells.
[1045.04 → 1046.00] That's a lot of money.
[1046.16 → 1047.92] That's a lot of freaking money.
[1047.92 → 1048.70] Half a mid.
[1048.70 → 1054.54] And the thing about commercial leases is they are way worse than residential leases.
[1055.08 → 1060.18] Like, and I know, residential rent agreements and lease agreements can be brutal.
[1060.30 → 1066.40] They can be so burdensome for the renter, especially if you live in an area where you don't have ample protections.
[1066.92 → 1067.94] But commercial?
[1068.98 → 1069.86] Whole other level.
[1070.18 → 1076.38] They're what are called triple net, which essentially means that you pay for your rent,
[1076.38 → 1086.98] and they get to advertise that lease rate, which is going to be per square foot, you know, probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of like 11 to $18 a square foot, depending on sort of what you're looking at.
[1087.04 → 1088.86] So, let's say 10 to $20 a square foot.
[1088.86 → 1092.42] Then, you have something called additional rent.
[1094.64 → 1095.70] What's your additional rent?
[1095.74 → 1096.60] Go ahead and ask me.
[1097.20 → 1100.68] What, what, yeah, what, what is that, is that like power and water?
[1100.80 → 1101.02] No.
[1101.02 → 1103.20] No, you pay, no, you pay your own utilities.
[1104.14 → 1105.80] I have genuinely no idea.
[1106.10 → 1106.42] Me neither.
[1107.20 → 1108.38] It's whatever it is.
[1108.38 → 1116.00] I just pass through to you whatever property tax I pay, whatever building maintenance I might incur.
[1116.34 → 1119.14] Now, I, as the landlord, have to pay it up front.
[1119.36 → 1122.48] So, if the building needs a new roof, I pay for the roof.
[1122.48 → 1132.50] But then what I do is I pass the I pass the expense along to you, and you pay me back yearly in instalments for that roof for my building.
[1132.62 → 1133.70] Oh, my God.
[1133.72 → 1135.34] That's how commercial works, baby.
[1135.34 → 1141.86] So, yeah, yeah, commercial, commercial leases.
[1142.18 → 1143.16] Absolutely brutal.
[1143.38 → 1146.44] Apparently, additional rent can go up by any percentage.
[1146.78 → 1146.90] Yeah.
[1146.98 → 1151.96] So, additional rent is used to circumvent the maximum percentage increases for rent.
[1152.50 → 1153.08] Yeah, that too.
[1153.08 → 1158.00] Because if they can't increase the base rent, they just increase the additional rent by any percentage they want.
[1158.36 → 1165.24] So, it could be, this is obviously not real, but it could be like 300% because they're like, ah, we need it to make up for whatever.
[1165.56 → 1165.80] Yeah.
[1166.48 → 1166.84] Yeah.
[1167.14 → 1168.56] Commercial, commercial leases.
[1168.70 → 1170.22] I also, I'm just like Googling this stuff.
[1170.28 → 1171.48] I don't know if this is 100% true or not.
[1171.52 → 1172.36] Don't say this is fact.
[1172.42 → 1175.36] It's, Shirley Times says, never sign a triple net lease.
[1176.12 → 1179.52] You will not find a lease in the Vancouver area that isn't triple net.
[1179.52 → 1181.54] And that's, that's even now.
[1181.66 → 1184.46] Even now that things are a bit more of a buyer's market.
[1184.68 → 1193.06] I think our vacancy, last time I looked at the report for it was under 1% real vacancy.
[1193.06 → 1195.00] Because some of the vacancy is not even real.
[1195.08 → 1197.94] It's like, it's fake because it's vacant now, but it's just pending.
[1198.50 → 1201.22] Uh, yeah, it's absolutely brutal.
[1201.48 → 1207.84] So, you pay the base rent, property taxes, building insurance and utilities, as well as other operating and maintenance costs.
[1207.96 → 1212.10] The landlord assumes no cost other than structural repairs.
[1212.10 → 1215.24] And structural, that means, that doesn't mean roof.
[1215.60 → 1217.72] That means like, the foundation.
[1217.96 → 1223.86] Essentially, unless the building collapses into the sea, they are not responsible for anything.
[1223.96 → 1224.70] And that whole.
[1224.86 → 1228.04] And you're paying the insurance, by the way, to cover if that happens.
[1228.04 → 1234.14] The whole other operating costs thing is where you're getting killed because they can define anything that way.
[1234.66 → 1237.40] Other operating costs could be, I don't know.
[1237.40 → 1242.26] The landlord decides to pay himself $40,000 an hour.
[1242.84 → 1243.12] I don't know.
[1243.16 → 1243.44] Who knows?
[1243.66 → 1243.82] Yeah.
[1243.92 → 1248.16] Or they hire trades that are like their buddies to do any of the work.
[1248.34 → 1248.60] Yeah.
[1248.72 → 1249.72] Pass that along to you.
[1249.92 → 1250.14] Yeah.
[1250.16 → 1251.00] That's not their problem.
[1251.24 → 1251.42] Yeah.
[1251.96 → 1252.22] Yeah.
[1252.26 → 1253.64] So, it's a whole, it's a whole thing.
[1253.88 → 1259.46] It leaves itself obviously glaringly open to abuse.
[1259.92 → 1261.60] But that's the system we have.
[1261.82 → 1262.22] Cool.
[1262.54 → 1262.78] All right.
[1262.78 → 1263.34] What else we got?
[1263.46 → 1263.80] Okay.
[1263.80 → 1265.64] We've got residential development.
[1265.82 → 1267.38] So, not a golf course, not a city block.
[1267.40 → 1269.12] Willowbrook Park is for sale, brother.
[1269.36 → 1269.94] What is that?
[1270.46 → 1272.08] It's, it's like Willowbrook.
[1272.32 → 1272.76] Like, like.
[1272.88 → 1273.34] Like the shop.
[1273.44 → 1274.00] Wait, what?
[1274.08 → 1275.26] Like the shopping centre.
[1275.36 → 1276.14] Not Willowbrook Mall.
[1276.36 → 1277.56] The one like right across from it.
[1277.70 → 1278.44] Willowbrook Park.
[1279.08 → 1280.96] Willowbrook Park is for sale.
[1281.12 → 1281.44] What?
[1281.68 → 1282.34] The whole thing?
[1282.38 → 1283.06] The whole thing.
[1283.64 → 1286.00] 200,000 square feet of retail.
[1287.62 → 1288.10] What?
[1288.52 → 1289.66] I know, right?
[1290.06 → 1290.82] 90 million.
[1291.46 → 1291.94] Dude.
[1291.94 → 1295.20] And the number of court ordered sales that I've seen recently.
[1295.38 → 1295.98] What the hell?
[1295.98 → 1298.50] Freaking wild.
[1299.64 → 1300.66] Mayfair Industrial.
[1300.66 → 1301.48] What's going on?
[1301.96 → 1302.18] Okay.
[1302.30 → 1302.96] So, this is.
[1302.96 → 1303.64] People are running out of money.
[1304.22 → 1304.48] Yeah.
[1304.98 → 1307.96] So, interest rates have been high for a while.
[1307.96 → 1308.34] A long time.
[1308.48 → 1313.18] And it takes a while because your mortgage is going to be on two year, three year, five
[1313.18 → 1314.84] year, five year renewal term, right?
[1315.28 → 1315.48] So.
[1315.58 → 1316.56] So, if you were on a fixed.
[1317.40 → 1317.74] Mm-hmm.
[1317.74 → 1323.82] So, in many cases, these properties are owned by people who are using them as a land bank.
[1323.94 → 1330.22] Essentially, they're just parking their money in an asset that, unlike cash, isn't going
[1330.22 → 1333.00] to just inflation rot itself into oblivion.
[1333.00 → 1338.20] Theoretically, you know, land, gold, crypto.
[1339.02 → 1341.90] I'm not endorsing any of these particular assets.
[1341.90 → 1348.84] But typically, assets are, as long as they aren't hyper-volatile ones, are a safer storage
[1348.84 → 1356.02] of wealth than just cash because there's nobody actively trying to deflate the value of it.
[1357.68 → 1365.40] So, what's happening is, all of a sudden, if you don't own the property outright, like
[1365.40 → 1370.74] if you're just hoping that, you know, your rent is going to cover your mortgage while the
[1370.74 → 1376.98] asset appreciates, that calculus, just like for many residential owners, is changing the
[1376.98 → 1381.18] second that you renew your mortgage, and you're not getting essentially free debt anymore.
[1381.56 → 1381.68] Yeah.
[1381.76 → 1386.64] So, this land bank might be appreciating, although in the case of Vancouver, as I mentioned,
[1386.72 → 1387.58] the market's softening.
[1387.78 → 1389.64] So, it maybe isn't appreciating.
[1389.88 → 1393.30] It's either not appreciating so much or it's just stagnating.
[1393.36 → 1397.34] And now, it's costing you way more than you thought it was.
[1397.40 → 1399.68] So, you're sitting here going, okay, well, there's no upside to this.
[1400.34 → 1402.50] Let's sell Willowbrook Park.
[1404.06 → 1406.08] Which, to be clear, that's an outdoor mall, yeah?
[1406.28 → 1406.46] Yeah.
[1406.46 → 1407.08] Someone across the street?
[1407.20 → 1407.34] Yeah.
[1407.54 → 1407.66] Yeah.
[1409.48 → 1411.52] So, it's not, some people were like, LTT Mall.
[1411.78 → 1413.54] It's like, yeah, I don't think it would be as interesting.
[1413.72 → 1413.98] Yeah.
[1414.32 → 1415.28] Yeah, not so much.
[1415.76 → 1416.74] This one's kind of interesting.
[1416.90 → 1421.62] You'll find a lot of the good land has been kind of developed.
[1421.94 → 1422.84] Sectioned off in ways.
[1423.32 → 1423.42] Yeah.
[1423.46 → 1427.56] So, what's left as development opportunities is going to be a lot of these, like, super
[1427.56 → 1429.08] weird shaped sites.
[1429.20 → 1429.50] Yeah.
[1429.84 → 1431.14] This is a good-shaped site.
[1431.14 → 1436.58] Four acres, though, of it are encumbered by a BC Hydro easement.
[1436.96 → 1437.26] Ooh.
[1437.26 → 1440.62] So, you got to watch out for, you got to watch out for easements.
[1440.62 → 1441.62] Oh.
[1441.62 → 1447.06] Because that pretty much means two thirds of this, BC Hydro, which is our power monopoly,
[1447.52 → 1451.60] needs to be able to drive on and access, essentially.
[1451.78 → 1451.90] Yep.
[1452.74 → 1455.66] So, that one, yeah, probably not super appealing.
[1455.84 → 1455.96] Okay.
[1456.02 → 1457.24] What else, what else we got here?
[1457.82 → 1458.18] Okay.
[1458.26 → 1458.66] Development.
[1460.24 → 1461.08] Office units.
[1461.20 → 1463.50] I mean, this is, this is not going to be that relevant to us.
[1464.72 → 1465.08] Yeah.
[1465.12 → 1465.26] Yeah.
[1465.74 → 1466.18] Residential.
[1467.00 → 1467.40] Residential.
[1467.42 → 1468.88] You could put in property type and stuff.
[1469.16 → 1469.78] You could use the filters.
[1469.78 → 1470.16] Okay.
[1470.28 → 1471.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1471.04 → 1471.20] Sure.
[1471.20 → 1472.60] Use the filters, tech man.
[1472.94 → 1473.18] Sure.
[1473.26 → 1474.02] I'll use the filters.
[1474.12 → 1474.96] I'll use the filters.
[1475.54 → 1475.82] All right.
[1475.90 → 1477.22] Now, let's get, you know what?
[1477.28 → 1480.12] Let's, let's look at, let's look at office too.
[1480.20 → 1481.64] Why don't we look at industrial and office?
[1481.64 → 1483.42] LTT towers, Linus tech towers.
[1485.72 → 1487.76] Oh, paved and fenced yard area.
[1487.86 → 1489.10] Oh, I can lease a yard.
[1489.38 → 1489.78] Oh yeah.
[1489.78 → 1490.28] You're welcome.
[1490.38 → 1491.76] I'll just pay your mortgage for you.
[1492.56 → 1493.46] Oh, what else we got?
[1493.88 → 1494.38] Oh man.
[1494.42 → 1495.12] This is far.
[1495.42 → 1496.18] This is really far.
[1496.28 → 1500.96] Also small, too small, brand new industrial facility in Port Coquitlam.
[1502.78 → 1503.76] This is too small.
[1503.86 → 1505.26] This is only about the size of the lab.
[1505.52 → 1508.18] So if the lab was big enough, then we could do that.
[1508.18 → 1520.08] So even now you can see with all of these options available to us, there's really not that much that would actually be suitable for us to move into.
[1520.20 → 1522.14] Unless you just, yeah, make your own town.
[1522.38 → 1524.14] Dude, we don't want to be on ANSIs Island.
[1526.40 → 1527.64] Dan's giving the mm-mm.
[1528.60 → 1529.28] No, thank you.
[1529.30 → 1529.92] Yeah, no, you don't want to be there.
[1529.92 → 1530.56] No, thank you.
[1530.90 → 1531.78] A, it's really far.
[1531.90 → 1533.54] B, it's like the traffic.
[1534.16 → 1534.38] Yeah.
[1534.38 → 1535.86] Burn your nostrils out for the rest of your life.
[1535.86 → 1539.50] That, and it's like the kind of the old industrial, like, crappy island.
[1539.64 → 1542.40] It's like, any of you guys play Anna?
[1543.00 → 1543.86] Anyone play Anna?
[1544.26 → 1549.94] Okay, so they put all the stuff that contributes to less beautification of your island.
[1550.22 → 1551.62] You know, you move it all onto like-
[1551.62 → 1552.42] Steel smelting, pink farms.
[1552.42 → 1553.44] Yeah, steel island.
[1553.68 → 1555.42] That's ANSIs Island, essentially.
[1555.68 → 1556.54] It's the rug of Vancouver.
[1556.72 → 1557.92] You just push everything under there.
[1558.00 → 1558.14] Yeah.
[1558.20 → 1558.34] Yeah.
[1558.34 → 1566.18] Okay, we can actually change our listings to just things that are for sale to kind of narrow things down a little bit.
[1567.08 → 1570.08] Basically, there's not actually that much.
[1570.18 → 1571.88] And part of the problem is that-
[1571.88 → 1572.48] City centre, dude?
[1572.64 → 1579.22] There's a big industrial park further down, like down here in Campbell Heights.
[1579.96 → 1582.88] That's pretty far from any population centres.
[1583.02 → 1585.16] Because like I said, most people are not living in South Surrey.
[1585.16 → 1590.46] So people are mostly living here, and they're living here, and they're living here.
[1591.68 → 1595.10] So the farther down South we go, the more challenging it gets.
[1595.18 → 1596.82] So Campbell Heights is down here.
[1599.28 → 1602.94] There was one that seemed kind of interesting, but it keeps, as you're scrolling around, it keeps-
[1602.94 → 1603.62] Oh, I'm sorry, the quad?
[1604.50 → 1604.86] No.
[1604.86 → 1605.66] That one's in Campbell Heights.
[1605.84 → 1607.46] No, it was scrolled down.
[1607.70 → 1609.00] It's not that mall again, is it?
[1609.04 → 1609.20] Nope.
[1609.22 → 1610.12] We're not buying that mall.
[1610.18 → 1611.38] No, no, no, it was scrolled down.
[1612.20 → 1613.10] Okay, court-ordered sale.
[1613.10 → 1615.10] It was right here, though.
[1615.16 → 1617.68] Oh, I don't know where you were looking at the time, Dan.
[1617.68 → 1618.82] I'm so sorry, Luke.
[1619.06 → 1619.52] I'm not sure.
[1619.62 → 1620.32] Maybe you'll see it.
[1620.68 → 1625.10] There is kind of an interesting one in Port Tells.
[1625.60 → 1626.82] So that's up in this area.
[1627.04 → 1631.78] So it's kind of a sister building to the Smash Champs Badminton Centre building.
[1632.42 → 1633.66] This is too far.
[1634.34 → 1636.20] It would be right next to Smash Champs would be sick.
[1636.32 → 1637.10] I would love it.
[1637.10 → 1639.38] But the problem with Port Tells is that it is-
[1639.38 → 1640.22] Best lunch breaks.
[1640.62 → 1641.56] Crazy expensive.
[1641.88 → 1642.12] Oh.
[1643.64 → 1645.48] Crazy, crazy expensive.
[1645.84 → 1646.74] Way out in Delta.
[1647.14 → 1649.06] Yeah, why do I even have Delta on the map?
[1649.20 → 1650.64] Okay, let's get Delta out of here.
[1650.70 → 1651.92] We don't need to see anything in Delta.
[1651.92 → 1656.22] Yeah, I think that's about it.
[1656.52 → 1659.06] I mean, is there anything else you want to look at?
[1659.22 → 1660.86] You want to ask, like, why not that one?
[1660.94 → 1662.08] Because I'll be happy to-
[1662.08 → 1662.84] Oh, is it this one?
[1663.68 → 1664.58] 192 Business Centre?
[1664.74 → 1666.02] It wasn't, but let's look at it.
[1666.24 → 1666.44] Sure.
[1666.58 → 1668.10] Yeah, we can look at 192 Business Centre.
[1668.10 → 1670.78] So this one is very similar to Smash Champs.
[1672.28 → 1673.14] Pretty nice.
[1673.56 → 1674.40] Brand-new building.
[1675.04 → 1675.30] Right?
[1675.64 → 1676.16] Pretty sick.
[1676.72 → 1677.76] Okay, let's have a look.
[1677.90 → 1678.58] Ooh, look at that.
[1678.60 → 1680.06] Up to 50,000 square feet.
[1680.22 → 1682.40] 32 foot clear ceilings.
[1682.66 → 1683.46] Lots of power.
[1684.06 → 1685.54] 200 amps.
[1685.96 → 1686.28] Woo!
[1686.46 → 1688.94] We'll get that high efficiency LED lighting.
[1689.12 → 1689.44] It's it.
[1689.66 → 1691.02] Brand-new buildings, man.
[1691.52 → 1692.12] Really nice.
[1692.18 → 1694.20] There's some very nice to haves.
[1694.20 → 1697.60] But there's a big problem with brand-new buildings.
[1698.10 → 1698.94] You notice something here?
[1699.54 → 1704.98] They talk a lot about when it's going to be complete and how many dock and grade loading
[1704.98 → 1708.60] bays you've got and how close it is to Highway 1.
[1708.76 → 1708.94] Okay.
[1709.66 → 1711.52] How close it is to the airport.
[1712.60 → 1713.56] Ah, okay.
[1713.78 → 1714.70] So here's our problem.
[1716.62 → 1719.22] How many parking stalls do we have?
[1720.38 → 1722.48] Yeah, this is very common with new buildings.
[1723.02 → 1725.28] They just don't put enough parking at all.
[1725.28 → 1728.62] Because you sell the building based on the square footage.
[1728.84 → 1729.06] Yeah.
[1729.20 → 1732.42] That's the calculation that everybody is doing.
[1732.58 → 1732.86] Yeah.
[1733.74 → 1737.16] But the parking stalls don't count towards square footage.
[1737.34 → 1739.32] So developers, and you know what?
[1739.36 → 1744.32] Part of this is honestly probably a good thing because less parking, fewer cars.
[1744.32 → 1748.44] If people were riding their bikes or taking transit more, that would be awesome.
[1748.44 → 1753.58] I can tell you right now, not a lot of that is happening here.
[1754.40 → 1754.52] Yeah.
[1755.18 → 1757.38] It just isn't.
[1757.90 → 1762.32] So part of it is good aspirationally if we were using more public transit.
[1762.76 → 1771.80] But the reality now is that that would accommodate maybe a quarter of our company right now.
[1771.80 → 1784.98] And my understanding, don't quote me on this, my understanding is that Beattie, the developer of this property, worked out a deal with the city where they didn't have to account for any street parking in their development.
[1785.42 → 1788.42] So they were able to effectively build right to the road.
[1788.84 → 1791.38] Like right to the travel areas of the road.
[1791.38 → 1801.02] So while the building we're in now also has inadequate parking, probably about the same ratio as a new building would have because they want to maximize the square footage they can sell.
[1802.04 → 1803.88] Ours at least has street parking.
[1804.00 → 1804.90] It's not ideal.
[1805.20 → 1809.02] Nobody likes walking, trudging to the building through the snow or whatever in the winter.
[1809.12 → 1809.56] But it's fine.
[1810.68 → 1811.68] But we have it.
[1811.82 → 1811.84] It's doable.
[1812.18 → 1812.30] Yeah.
[1812.38 → 1814.52] At least there is somewhere to put your car.
[1814.52 → 1818.58] This you'd be parking probably in the neighbourhood of like five to six blocks away.
[1819.08 → 1819.32] Which.
[1819.32 → 1826.42] If it's anything like Smash Champs, which I actually did have to pace out because we were trying to figure out what parking would look like for a LAN event, for example.
[1826.70 → 1831.74] So at LAN events, if we can get the city on board at Smash, which by the way, oh, we can talk about that.
[1831.80 → 1833.90] We submitted our package to them this week.
[1834.22 → 1835.72] We gave the city our package.
[1835.94 → 1836.46] Did you know?
[1836.70 → 1837.18] We did.
[1837.70 → 1838.44] Was it well received?
[1838.90 → 1839.68] I think so.
[1839.84 → 1840.14] Nice.
[1840.34 → 1840.84] I think so.
[1840.88 → 1841.86] I think they were.
[1842.36 → 1842.90] You asked them?
[1842.90 → 1844.24] They admired it.
[1844.24 → 1845.10] Was it good for you?
[1846.52 → 1848.08] So we gave them the package.
[1849.32 → 1851.52] We can talk about that a little bit more later, actually.
[1851.64 → 1854.24] I'm pretty excited to talk about Whale land.
[1854.42 → 1858.76] But if it's anything like Smash, it's brutal, basically.
[1859.22 → 1861.98] It's fine if you're coming in once a quarter for an event.
[1862.32 → 1862.50] Yeah.
[1862.60 → 1869.90] But if you're commuting every day, and you're like hiking from your car, you're going to need like an electric scooter in your car just to do the last leg of your commute, which is a little ridiculous.
[1870.24 → 1871.28] So that's the problem.
[1871.28 → 1876.64] There's a video upgrading every one of my employees' cars with like an electric scooter storage.
[1878.34 → 1878.70] Sorry.
[1878.82 → 1879.04] Keep going.
[1879.22 → 1881.50] The older buildings will have more parking.
[1881.60 → 1882.52] They'll have more yard space.
[1882.56 → 1882.72] Yeah.
[1882.90 → 1888.22] But they will lack a lot of nice-to-haves that are going to need to be upgraded that are going to cost money.
[1888.22 → 1897.06] The newer buildings are built with the new meta, which means you get a lot more up-to-date, nice stuff, good power, good LED lighting.
[1897.16 → 1901.24] They're way more efficient in terms of keeping in heat and keeping out cold, that sort of thing.
[1901.56 → 1902.28] Which is money.
[1902.54 → 1904.90] But they have no parking.
[1906.02 → 1907.12] What else we got here?
[1908.98 → 1910.62] We don't have to do this much longer if you guys are bored.
[1910.74 → 1911.40] Underground parking.
[1911.60 → 1911.72] Okay.
[1911.84 → 1912.74] I find this stuff interesting.
[1912.74 → 1916.04] Booker asks what about underground parking over in float plane chat?
[1916.24 → 1917.08] There's very little of it here.
[1917.32 → 1918.02] You know why?
[1918.52 → 1918.76] No.
[1919.22 → 1919.46] Well.
[1920.38 → 1921.90] Is it like the water table or something?
[1922.08 → 1923.28] What I would...
[1923.28 → 1923.50] Okay.
[1923.62 → 1928.46] So A, I suspect there is something to do with that, but I don't know anything about the actual engineering of it.
[1928.46 → 1928.64] Sure.
[1928.64 → 1939.96] What I can tell you is that the way that property values have skyrocketed here in such a short period of time has changed the calculus for underground parking in a big way.
[1939.96 → 1944.88] So it would have been not that long ago that underground parking didn't make any sense here.
[1944.96 → 1945.86] It's really expensive.
[1946.16 → 1946.64] It's...
[1946.64 → 1946.98] It's...
[1946.98 → 1951.06] The last quote I got was about 100,000 Canadian dollars per stall.
[1951.30 → 1961.84] And that is going to be somewhat dependent on what kind of building you're building and like whether you would have had to dig a big hole anyway versus if you're digging it just for the express purpose of putting cars in it.
[1961.84 → 1975.52] But pretty much until land values went to the moon here, it made way more sense to do the suburbia thing and just sprawl your parking lots.
[1975.72 → 1975.76] Yeah.
[1975.76 → 1983.96] So what I suspect is we'll see a lot more of them in the future, but they don't really exist here, at least not now, because it didn't make any sense.
[1984.10 → 1984.52] It was...
[1984.52 → 1988.16] The land was not worth so much that it was worth digging into it in order to park cars in it.
[1988.16 → 1990.74] The only thing you'd see it for was apartment buildings generally.
[1990.96 → 1991.14] Yeah.
[1992.14 → 1993.74] I don't necessarily know why, but that was a thing.
[1993.98 → 1994.12] Yeah.
[1994.18 → 1996.24] Shrank says, you can always add nice tabs.
[1996.32 → 1997.70] You can't add more parking stalls.
[1997.92 → 1998.52] You can.
[1998.52 → 1999.16] Yeah.
[1999.32 → 2001.32] Already, Ralph says, rooftop parking.
[2001.44 → 2001.62] Yes.
[2001.74 → 2001.98] Yes.
[2002.38 → 2008.58] That is technically possible, but you're going to have to re-engineer the entire bloody structure to hold all the cars on the roof.
[2008.66 → 2012.24] So that's going to be requiring some budget.
[2012.24 → 2012.60] Minor cost.
[2012.78 → 2013.02] Yeah.
[2013.16 → 2013.68] Some budget.
[2014.00 → 2022.34] Just, you know, have a program where a certain percentage of the employee base gets free Uber's to work.
[2022.86 → 2024.28] I actually kind of like this one.
[2024.48 → 2025.34] It's really close to home.
[2025.88 → 2026.76] I've seen this before.
[2026.76 → 2033.16] But part of the problem is that while it does have 100,000 square feet of building on it, I don't think...
[2033.16 → 2033.62] Is that train?
[2034.32 → 2035.34] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2035.34 → 2035.80] That's the rail.
[2036.16 → 2037.94] I mean, okay, look.
[2038.70 → 2039.60] Okay, let me get to that.
[2039.62 → 2040.14] Let me get to that.
[2040.14 → 2043.72] It has 100,000 square feet of building on it, but those are the buildings.
[2044.92 → 2046.76] We ain't using those buildings.
[2047.24 → 2047.58] No.
[2047.82 → 2050.62] This is what we call in the biz a teardown.
[2050.62 → 2057.30] So that would help, you know, with mitigating train noise is you could, you know, double insulate your walls or whatever else.
[2057.30 → 2058.18] Like you could actually...
[2058.18 → 2059.02] It's still not going to solve it.
[2059.26 → 2061.12] It won't solve it, but it would do a lot.
[2061.12 → 2074.62] But the cost of this, because you're essentially buying $100,000 worth of buildings that you are going to then wrecked, makes this just not make any sense.
[2074.70 → 2076.72] I don't even think they have a price quoted on this one.
[2076.80 → 2078.68] I might have asked at some point, but I can't remember.
[2079.92 → 2082.42] But yeah, this one's, yeah, interesting.
[2082.42 → 2091.14] But unfortunately, what's also cool about this one is it's over the 196th Street border, which means that we'd be eligible for more film and production services tax credits.
[2091.78 → 2099.88] I suspect whoever's selling it is hoping that whoever buys it wants the buildings to just store stuff from the trains in so that they don't need to be nice.
[2101.26 → 2101.70] Yeah.
[2102.92 → 2105.08] Unfortunately, that's not me.
[2105.36 → 2107.68] So get rest, me.
[2108.04 → 2108.28] Yep.
[2108.54 → 2109.82] Yeah, someone asked this.
[2109.82 → 2116.80] And I can think of some reasons why this might be rough, but there is, there are examples of this around the area, but empty land.
[2117.86 → 2119.10] Yeah, there's not much.
[2119.40 → 2123.32] And a lot of what is, a lot of what's empty land is ALR.
[2123.44 → 2128.66] So you'll see it, you'll look at it, and you'll be like, oh yeah, look how many buildings we could put here.
[2128.90 → 2130.82] What if we made...
[2132.46 → 2134.30] I mean, there's Clarkson's farm.
[2134.94 → 2136.12] It's doing very well.
[2136.20 → 2137.54] What about a server farm?
[2137.54 → 2138.60] What if we had land...
[2138.60 → 2138.92] Oh!
[2138.92 → 2140.50] What if we had Linus's farm?
[2140.50 → 2141.62] Ding it, ding the thing.
[2141.98 → 2143.36] You have to ding your own thing.
[2144.44 → 2145.90] What if we did Linus's farm?
[2146.00 → 2148.02] What's the minimum we would need to farm?
[2148.90 → 2149.82] It could be fine.
[2150.18 → 2152.08] You can do things like chickens, and it's like whatever.
[2152.28 → 2153.24] Six pigs or something?
[2153.38 → 2160.06] It's less that how much minimum we would need to farm, and it's more how much maximum other things could we do there.
[2160.06 → 2171.26] We couldn't have a production studio on a farm because that would devalue the production studio zoned land that somebody else bought before.
[2171.26 → 2176.94] Also, pretty much all of our farmland in the lower mainland is floodplain.
[2176.94 → 2187.56] And I don't know about you, but I'm not super into buying things that are going to be underwater soon or could be underwater soon.
[2187.56 → 2190.28] And we have had some very significant floods here.
[2190.28 → 2201.54] Our only road was wiped out for a substantial amount of time because of basically a lake that we unbaked, and then it decided to re-lake itself.
[2202.68 → 2204.58] It's fun when things re-lake themselves.
[2204.84 → 2205.02] Yeah.
[2206.14 → 2211.54] Breweries on ALR with their own hops have issues with the ALR.
[2211.54 → 2212.34] Yep.
[2212.34 → 2212.38] Yep.
[2212.80 → 2214.46] I mean, I can see that.
[2215.46 → 2223.54] I know of a not small amount of people in BC that are aggressively skirting ALR rules.
[2223.54 → 2236.92] And I think if someone from the ALR just took a little drive around a lot of places in BC and cared at all, a lot of people would lose their setups.
[2236.92 → 2242.74] So it makes me care less when it feels like more than half of it is being abused.
[2243.54 → 2245.84] And it makes me want to do it ourselves.
[2246.02 → 2249.22] I get such a kick out of the gigantic mansions.
[2249.34 → 2250.30] The Omega mansions.
[2250.36 → 2251.06] On farmland.
[2251.08 → 2253.60] With no farming going on ever.
[2254.06 → 2254.62] Like this is.
[2254.90 → 2255.88] Oh, we got them going.
[2256.00 → 2257.20] We got them going here, boys.
[2257.40 → 2257.78] Here we go.
[2257.84 → 2258.20] Here we go.
[2258.40 → 2262.10] At least my biggest thing is like you should at least f***ING attempt.
[2262.52 → 2264.20] You should at least try.
[2264.88 → 2266.20] Put something there.
[2266.20 → 2268.74] Why is it just open grass field?
[2268.86 → 2269.68] You don't have horses.
[2269.94 → 2271.84] There's no f***ING horses.
[2272.10 → 2273.06] There's nothing else.
[2273.10 → 2273.98] You're doing nothing.
[2274.18 → 2275.58] How do they get away with this?
[2275.98 → 2277.34] I know the whole flip.
[2277.48 → 2278.56] I've heard the stories.
[2278.70 → 2283.16] I know the flip of you bring an outside company to plant some junk.
[2283.48 → 2285.62] And then you have them also come pick it.
[2285.84 → 2288.04] And you make zero dollars off of it.
[2288.18 → 2294.44] But the whole thing is so that you can have your stupid, probably disgusting looking, terribly designed building.
[2294.44 → 2298.66] On this plot of land in the middle of nowhere that you'd live in and do nothing else.
[2298.66 → 2301.86] And probably don't see anyone because you're xenophobic for some reason.
[2302.16 → 2302.52] Anyway.
[2304.00 → 2305.40] I hate.
[2306.64 → 2307.08] Anyway.
[2308.08 → 2308.56] Wow.
[2308.70 → 2310.14] But it's all just it's all a joke.
[2310.14 → 2314.88] I've also heard that a huge percentage of that crop just gets thrown away.
[2315.96 → 2317.88] Because it's not growing whatever.
[2318.08 → 2320.24] They're not growing based on what we need.
[2320.32 → 2321.38] They're growing based on.
[2321.82 → 2323.88] And it's not being properly treated.
[2324.18 → 2327.94] It's just being planted and then pulled out of the ground at the end of the season.
[2328.14 → 2328.40] Right.
[2328.50 → 2328.66] Yeah.
[2328.68 → 2329.12] That makes sense.
[2329.12 → 2330.64] So like it's a lot of its junk.
[2330.64 → 2335.22] Like it's just it's this clear, obvious, insane charade.
[2335.34 → 2349.30] And there are parts of BC that you can literally drive around for a very long time when you're just going mansion with no farm, mansion with no farm, mansion with no farm for like ever.
[2349.30 → 2358.88] And it's just it really makes you not surprised when you drive around farmland in BC figuring out that there's more corruption in BC than like practically anywhere.
[2359.02 → 2363.02] Because you're like, I wonder where do all the people live that have all this corruption?
[2363.10 → 2367.44] And then you drive around what should be farmland, and you're like, oh, it's oops, all mansions.
[2367.84 → 2368.46] Like, OK.
[2368.76 → 2369.16] Anyway.
[2372.24 → 2372.86] All right.
[2373.58 → 2374.02] Yeah.
[2374.72 → 2375.46] Good chat.
[2375.68 → 2376.26] I'll relax.
[2376.26 → 2384.68] So anyway, we still have our ear to the ground and I suspect I'm talking as much to our staff as I am to our viewers at this point.
[2384.80 → 2389.10] We still have our ear to the ground, but it's its a challenge.
[2390.74 → 2394.60] Taryn sent me one actually the other day that looked pretty cool.
[2395.90 → 2401.46] It's a little far from my house, which I'm not a huge fan of.
[2403.00 → 2403.48] Move.
[2404.20 → 2404.78] More videos.
[2404.94 → 2405.30] More videos.
[2405.30 → 2407.28] It would be far from a lot of people.
[2407.28 → 2408.74] Oh, you'd have to set up your new house.
[2409.06 → 2410.36] I really don't want to move.
[2412.18 → 2413.42] Here, let's see if I can.
[2413.58 → 2414.28] Oh, wait, not this one.
[2414.32 → 2414.88] No, this was me.
[2414.94 → 2415.58] Free content.
[2415.90 → 2418.56] This was me sending him the stupid mall.
[2418.88 → 2420.36] Let me see if I can find it.
[2420.90 → 2421.18] Oh, yeah.
[2421.20 → 2421.94] Here we go.
[2424.54 → 2425.98] 085 North Fraser away.
[2426.66 → 2428.36] Honestly, it looks pretty cool.
[2428.36 → 2434.92] One of the big problems is like the perfect solutions are going to be so far out.
[2435.62 → 2438.68] And then they've they become bad solutions for other reasons.
[2439.10 → 2439.70] Oh, yeah.
[2439.70 → 2440.34] That's right.
[2440.34 → 2441.26] Relocating the whole company.
[2441.46 → 2441.58] Okay.
[2441.62 → 2441.92] Hold on.
[2441.96 → 2443.44] You asked about empty land.
[2443.66 → 2443.80] Yeah.
[2443.80 → 2446.92] That's a big problem for empty land.
[2447.86 → 2450.26] Is that it's all really far out.
[2450.58 → 2453.34] I know I've seen some locally, but it's probably like residential or something.
[2453.54 → 2458.50] Dude, Smash Champs was a completed building when we got it.
[2458.50 → 2462.14] Think about how long it took us just to do the tenant improvement.
[2462.32 → 2462.58] Oh, yeah.
[2462.58 → 2468.50] If we're building a building, it's like two to three years before we will actually move
[2468.50 → 2468.84] into it.
[2468.84 → 2470.28] You just you spin up a new channel.
[2470.50 → 2470.66] Oh, my God.
[2470.66 → 2471.48] That is building tips.
[2472.24 → 2472.56] LBT.
[2473.44 → 2476.36] Um, I Clarkson's farm it.
[2476.82 → 2478.56] I can't find this for some reason.
[2478.68 → 2480.30] What if you don't even hire a contracting company?
[2480.36 → 2481.64] What if you are the contracting company?
[2482.40 → 2483.30] What if you are sorry?
[2483.42 → 2484.34] What if you don't?
[2484.44 → 2485.64] I got a concrete mixer.
[2485.76 → 2487.04] We could do that in a weekend.
[2487.16 → 2487.76] Let's do it.
[2487.78 → 2488.26] Let's do it.
[2488.26 → 2490.54] We've got a laser level in logistics.
[2490.82 → 2491.38] It'll be fine.
[2491.44 → 2492.10] We can figure it out.
[2492.28 → 2493.16] Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[2493.94 → 2495.70] All the walls are just made of conduit.
[2495.84 → 2496.96] Linus said he likes conduit.
[2497.24 → 2498.88] We'll just make it out of conduit.
[2498.94 → 2500.38] You never have any problems running any cables.
[2500.54 → 2500.76] No.
[2500.86 → 2501.54] Might be a little loud.
[2502.26 → 2503.86] No, you put insulation like in between.
[2503.86 → 2504.62] In the conduit.
[2504.68 → 2505.14] In the conduit.
[2508.10 → 2508.86] Oh, my God.
[2508.92 → 2509.72] We're figuring it out.
[2509.82 → 2511.04] This is why you're CTO.
[2511.76 → 2512.60] So smart.
[2512.74 → 2513.46] He's so smart.
[2514.08 → 2514.80] Oh, no.
[2515.08 → 2516.12] Bikes between the buildings.
[2516.34 → 2516.74] Keep looking.
[2516.74 → 2518.70] We keep our ear to the ground.
[2518.92 → 2519.08] Yeah.
[2519.40 → 2523.20] We kind of, you know, watch what's happening with the market.
[2523.20 → 2525.98] And we hope that at some point we can find something.
[2526.26 → 2532.04] And we're going to look at moving some departments around, you know, to have people who work together
[2532.04 → 2533.52] closer together.
[2533.52 → 2536.40] But it is actually pretty tough.
[2536.72 → 2542.66] And part of the problem is, like you said, the way that we built this place out piecemeal means that it's not as flexible of a space.
[2544.92 → 2545.32] Monorail.
[2546.66 → 2547.10] Monorail.
[2548.40 → 2548.84] Monorail.
[2549.28 → 2549.52] Okay.
[2549.66 → 2549.92] Anyway.
[2551.36 → 2552.54] What do you want to talk about next?
[2552.66 → 2553.14] Merch messages.
[2553.40 → 2555.04] We should put train tracks behind the buildings.
[2555.04 → 2557.72] And then get those old bikes that you can ride on train tracks.
[2557.80 → 2558.06] Okay.
[2558.90 → 2560.00] Merch messages, apparently.
[2560.62 → 2563.84] Oh, oh, there's something really exciting for merch messages, though.
[2564.22 → 2564.88] This is pretty.
[2564.90 → 2565.70] Oh, my God.
[2565.76 → 2566.74] There's so many.
[2568.36 → 2570.74] There are so many announcements.
[2571.10 → 2572.34] It's kind of too many announcements, guys.
[2572.44 → 2572.66] Yeah.
[2572.66 → 2574.36] We might have to dial back the announcements.
[2574.58 → 2575.00] But okay.
[2575.04 → 2575.34] Fine.
[2575.42 → 2577.36] First, double sweet 16 live stream.
[2577.36 → 2580.42] We just hit 16 million subscribers on the LTT channel.
[2580.54 → 2584.46] And we're currently planning a stream for November for our 16th anniversary.
[2584.98 → 2585.20] Nice.
[2585.28 → 2587.12] How did those things line up so perfectly?
[2587.38 → 2588.92] One million subscribers a year.
[2589.26 → 2590.00] Not bad.
[2590.42 → 2597.90] We're tentatively planning to look back at some of our most watched videos and do 16 builds that we're going to auction for charity on Jaw.
[2598.06 → 2598.34] Wow.
[2598.46 → 2598.94] That's a lot.
[2598.94 → 2600.36] So that's coming up November 16th.
[2601.26 → 2601.90] Oh, no.
[2602.16 → 2603.40] For November for our 16th.
[2603.40 → 2603.70] I don't know.
[2603.76 → 2604.46] Sometime in November.
[2604.92 → 2605.06] Yeah.
[2605.06 → 2608.44] And now a segue to our sponsor.
[2609.56 → 2611.24] And it says Dan will play a video.
[2611.42 → 2612.80] Hi, it's James from LTT Store.
[2613.02 → 2615.54] Anyone ever tell you don't clean your screen with your t-shirt?
[2615.56 → 2615.78] What?
[2615.78 → 2619.26] Screwed our rules because we made a t-shirt for exactly that purpose.
[2619.80 → 2622.14] A regular shirt would scrap up your glasses.
[2622.14 → 2626.82] Since the LTT microfiber t-shirt is made of soft fabric loops, it won't.
[2626.88 → 2631.46] This is for your car, your jar, your glasses, your phone.
[2631.46 → 2636.44] And it's got this soft, cozy jersey fabric interior so you can just wear this puppy all day long.
[2636.50 → 2638.48] As a certified glasses cleaner, this works.
[2638.74 → 2639.42] Unlike you.
[2639.52 → 2640.36] It's made by nerds.
[2640.38 → 2641.60] You know the nerds always make good stuff.
[2641.68 → 2642.24] Here's how to order.
[2642.24 → 2656.70] If you want sarcastic ads, Riley and James are just like the way to go.
[2657.08 → 2657.82] That was fantastic.
[2658.06 → 2659.12] I had not seen that before.
[2659.28 → 2661.66] The best part is it wasn't satire.
[2664.04 → 2664.52] It's...
[2664.52 → 2665.76] I've been wearing it the whole show.
[2665.92 → 2666.12] Yeah.
[2666.12 → 2669.20] You didn't even notice except for the people that asked if my shirt was wet.
[2669.20 → 2670.64] It's a real product.
[2670.88 → 2672.04] Now, look, guys.
[2673.16 → 2679.08] That funny video aside, I do not want to oversell this thing.
[2679.22 → 2685.06] Because it is not up to the regular standards of our regular t-shirts.
[2685.52 → 2687.04] It is not as comfortable.
[2687.56 → 2691.46] It is literally made of microfiber cloth material.
[2691.88 → 2692.12] Okay?
[2692.12 → 2698.36] That means it has some disadvantages in terms of comfort, which I already kind of touched on.
[2698.56 → 2700.56] But it also has some advantages.
[2701.34 → 2702.58] Advantage number the first.
[2703.02 → 2703.60] It's really warm.
[2704.82 → 2705.04] Yeah.
[2705.38 → 2705.64] Yep.
[2705.80 → 2710.84] It is actually, like, uncomfortably warm if you are moving around a lot.
[2710.84 → 2712.20] It's like a sweater.
[2712.72 → 2713.00] Yeah.
[2713.18 → 2713.34] Yeah.
[2713.34 → 2717.34] It also means that, like, the sizing and the drape...
[2718.86 → 2720.14] Are a little different.
[2720.22 → 2722.06] A little different from our typical shirts.
[2722.24 → 2725.44] So, it ends up with kind of, like, a very fitted fit.
[2725.54 → 2726.86] I would say, if you like our...
[2726.86 → 2729.48] This is me wearing our, like, my typical size.
[2729.82 → 2734.02] So, if you like our typical fit, this isn't going to be it.
[2734.46 → 2738.10] You could maybe size up, or you could just, I don't know, not buy the microfiber shirt.
[2738.10 → 2739.52] I tend to wear XLs.
[2739.60 → 2741.72] I put on the XL microfiber shirt.
[2741.80 → 2742.62] My arms didn't fit.
[2742.62 → 2743.14] Yeah.
[2743.46 → 2743.64] Yeah.
[2743.78 → 2744.74] So, it's a little tighter.
[2744.82 → 2745.48] Because it's not...
[2745.48 → 2745.88] It doesn't have...
[2745.88 → 2746.76] This is a 2XL.
[2746.80 → 2747.40] I normally wear an XL.
[2747.40 → 2748.46] It doesn't have the same...
[2748.46 → 2750.22] It doesn't have the same stretch, you know?
[2750.80 → 2752.08] But, but...
[2752.08 → 2752.36] Here.
[2752.60 → 2752.84] Okay?
[2753.02 → 2753.78] Let's do...
[2753.78 → 2754.88] Let's do a little experiment.
[2755.02 → 2755.18] Okay?
[2755.22 → 2756.56] I got a...
[2756.56 → 2759.00] You know, usually my face is greasier than my hands.
[2759.04 → 2759.24] Okay?
[2759.32 → 2761.46] So, you know, got the...
[2761.46 → 2763.58] Get that face grease on there.
[2763.60 → 2763.76] Okay?
[2763.80 → 2764.68] Oh, stop it.
[2765.14 → 2765.44] Okay.
[2765.74 → 2766.14] Okay.
[2766.14 → 2766.74] You guys see it?
[2766.82 → 2767.38] Pretty...
[2767.38 → 2768.18] You can see that?
[2768.26 → 2768.94] Pretty greasy, right?
[2768.96 → 2769.18] Yeah.
[2769.30 → 2769.52] Huh?
[2769.64 → 2769.96] Okay?
[2770.10 → 2770.56] Watch this.
[2770.64 → 2770.84] Boom.
[2770.84 → 2772.10] I don't even need to...
[2772.10 → 2773.62] I don't need to go find a cloth nowhere.
[2773.82 → 2774.28] I don't gotta...
[2774.28 → 2776.34] I did notice, like, it seems like the...
[2776.34 → 2780.68] The microfibers, I guess, are like a little shorter, maybe?
[2781.00 → 2782.06] Than in some cloths?
[2782.12 → 2783.84] So, it might take a little bit more work.
[2784.40 → 2784.76] But it...
[2784.76 → 2784.88] No.
[2785.00 → 2785.48] It works.
[2785.80 → 2786.36] She's perfect.
[2786.60 → 2786.98] Look at that.
[2787.08 → 2787.64] She's...
[2787.64 → 2790.04] She's completely like new.
[2790.74 → 2791.34] Isn't that beautiful?
[2791.56 → 2792.32] Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[2792.84 → 2794.08] So, um...
[2794.08 → 2796.40] It's as much a meme as it is a real product.
[2796.54 → 2797.18] It's one of those...
[2797.18 → 2797.68] I bet pets will enjoy it.
[2797.84 → 2801.50] It's one of those products that came about as sort of, like...
[2801.50 → 2802.78] What if we...
[2802.78 → 2803.54] What if we do this?
[2803.80 → 2804.16] Yeah.
[2804.30 → 2805.48] We should do it for April Fools.
[2805.58 → 2806.48] No, let's just do it.
[2806.96 → 2810.14] I asked to make sure that we didn't order too many, and it sounds like that's probably
[2810.14 → 2810.40] true.
[2810.78 → 2811.06] Oh, no.
[2811.10 → 2811.22] Yeah.
[2811.26 → 2812.48] No, we didn't order that many of them.
[2812.56 → 2814.60] Which might mean...
[2814.60 → 2815.68] Order now!
[2815.94 → 2817.08] You might not get one.
[2817.52 → 2817.84] Yeah.
[2817.84 → 2821.74] You might not get a lot of opportunities to get your hands on this, but that might be okay.
[2821.74 → 2822.14] Yeah.
[2822.74 → 2824.44] So, anyway, if you're into it...
[2824.44 → 2825.18] I will say...
[2825.18 → 2826.24] It's a conversation starter.
[2826.30 → 2826.94] I'll tell you that much.
[2827.30 → 2829.08] I mostly forgot I was wearing it.
[2829.70 → 2831.00] I don't think it's that bad.
[2831.10 → 2833.02] Elijah in the chat said it gave him sensory issues.
[2833.22 → 2834.82] Your experience may vary.
[2835.06 → 2835.34] Yeah.
[2836.48 → 2836.88] Yeah.
[2837.18 → 2839.08] Doing this doesn't feel great.
[2839.20 → 2842.04] If I was going to go in a jog in this thing, I think I'd be pretty upset.
[2843.24 → 2845.18] Doing this with your arms is not awesome.
[2845.84 → 2846.88] Have you tried that?
[2848.20 → 2848.70] Oh, yeah.
[2848.76 → 2849.30] Rub it against...
[2849.30 → 2849.94] Yeah, the elbows.
[2849.94 → 2850.22] Yeah.
[2850.22 → 2852.04] Because it's, you know, it's microfiber, right?
[2852.18 → 2852.46] So...
[2852.46 → 2854.14] You'll like rug burn yourself.
[2854.16 → 2857.72] If you want to know what it feels like, go find a microfiber cloth.
[2857.84 → 2859.16] You know, one of those blue ones.
[2859.64 → 2862.10] And, you know, put it on yourself.
[2862.36 → 2862.54] Yeah.
[2862.58 → 2862.78] You know?
[2862.92 → 2863.62] But, anyway.
[2864.04 → 2864.26] Yeah.
[2865.34 → 2869.12] Why don't we take a little break from announcements and do a couple merch messages?
[2869.24 → 2872.04] So, the way to send a merch message is to just go to an LTTstore.com.
[2872.10 → 2872.84] Put something in your cart.
[2872.92 → 2874.12] You'll see a little box for a merch message.
[2874.12 → 2878.80] And once you check out, it'll go to Producer Dan, who will forward it to us or put it down
[2878.80 → 2882.40] there or who will reply to it himself or who will send it to someone else internally that
[2882.40 → 2884.78] show you what it looks like when he curates them for us.
[2884.84 → 2885.08] Sorry.
[2885.74 → 2887.96] Digital said, can we get it with a Star Trek logo?
[2888.12 → 2890.02] I said, like, right when I sat down in it.
[2890.06 → 2891.58] I was like, wow, it looks like a Star Trek shirt.
[2891.68 → 2893.32] You can put your own Star Trek logo on it.
[2893.40 → 2893.62] Yeah.
[2893.62 → 2897.66] We are not licensed by Paramount or whoever the heck.
[2897.98 → 2899.90] Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[2900.08 → 2900.20] Yep.
[2900.76 → 2902.42] Then again, you never know if you don't ask.
[2904.14 → 2904.58] True.
[2904.92 → 2906.08] But it would cost way more.
[2906.30 → 2906.40] Yeah.
[2906.40 → 2907.04] Do you really want to?
[2907.32 → 2911.76] Like, guys, there's a reason that licensed merchandise always sucks.
[2912.56 → 2919.46] It's because the money goes into licensing the brand rather than finding the finest microfiber
[2919.46 → 2921.66] rags to build your shirt out of.
[2921.66 → 2923.22] It's incredibly expensive.
[2923.22 → 2923.62] Yeah.
[2925.32 → 2926.22] Hit us, Dan.
[2926.52 → 2926.82] Sure.
[2927.18 → 2929.78] Hey, DLL, loving my precision kit already.
[2930.10 → 2932.10] Used it to fix my switchblade yesterday.
[2932.70 → 2935.48] Linus, what's your favourite genre of music to clean your house to?
[2936.44 → 2936.84] Oh.
[2937.74 → 2940.98] Oh, I don't know.
[2944.58 → 2952.82] Man, I always struggle when people ask me about my taste in music because it's pretty
[2952.82 → 2954.12] random.
[2955.08 → 2957.18] And I know, like, everyone says that.
[2958.00 → 2962.92] Everyone says, like, oh, yeah, I listen to, like, really random music.
[2962.92 → 2965.30] But, like, no really.
[2965.30 → 2968.30] So I got some Maroon 5 here.
[2968.46 → 2969.58] I got some Tupac.
[2969.64 → 2971.48] I got some Michael Jackson.
[2972.22 → 2973.70] I got some Ghostbusters.
[2973.70 → 2974.28] So far, I've seen that random.
[2974.52 → 2975.64] Ghostbusters theme music.
[2976.14 → 2976.62] Okay, maybe a little random.
[2976.68 → 2978.60] No, it's, like, actually, like, random.
[2978.74 → 2979.92] Like, you could just throw a dart.
[2979.92 → 2982.80] It's, you know, got some Annie Lennox in here.
[2982.98 → 2983.60] Like, I don't know.
[2984.54 → 2989.70] I'll listen to Shania Twain, you know, or, like, Taylor Swift's first album.
[2989.80 → 2991.10] I'll listen to kind of, like, pop country.
[2991.30 → 2991.56] Okay.
[2991.70 → 2994.04] I'm not into much country.
[2994.80 → 2996.60] I came across...
[2996.60 → 2997.18] Oh, man.
[2997.34 → 2997.56] Uh-oh.
[2999.18 → 3000.56] What's the song called?
[3001.12 → 3002.02] Song Pillars...
[3002.02 → 3003.34] Seven Pillars of Something.
[3003.54 → 3004.70] I came across these guys.
[3004.72 → 3005.54] Seven Pillars of Awesome?
[3006.40 → 3006.84] No.
[3006.84 → 3007.16] Those guys?
[3007.48 → 3008.04] Isn't that a thing?
[3009.56 → 3009.96] Saba ton.
[3010.14 → 3011.34] Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
[3011.46 → 3015.06] I came across these Saba ton guys when I was playing Beat Safer the other day.
[3015.22 → 3018.10] And it's, like, it's, like, freaking awesome.
[3018.98 → 3022.94] The first thing that I thought when I heard this song was, like,
[3023.02 → 3026.16] there's no way that Adam Sondergaard from the writing department
[3026.16 → 3027.54] does not listen to these guys.
[3027.54 → 3029.18] Because it's just, like, it's, like, the most...
[3029.18 → 3030.94] It's the most Adam thing ever.
[3031.44 → 3032.26] So, yeah, I don't know.
[3032.36 → 3032.62] Random.
[3033.18 → 3033.90] Legitimately random.
[3034.40 → 3034.64] Yeah.
[3034.64 → 3037.82] I'm fairly all over the place as well.
[3037.90 → 3039.56] Well, I thought it was Sea Shanties with you.
[3039.90 → 3040.66] No, that's for the birds.
[3040.80 → 3041.38] Yeah, I know.
[3041.46 → 3044.32] But, I mean, that's what you're listening to while you clean the house for better or for worse.
[3044.38 → 3047.28] That does play a very often percentage of the time.
[3047.68 → 3050.26] Yeah, it'll be that or, like, some local radio station.
[3050.36 → 3054.12] Just because, like, the radio clock thing that we use to make sure that they have music
[3054.12 → 3055.68] just, like, plays radio stations.
[3055.82 → 3056.78] But I never listen to it.
[3057.32 → 3058.20] I don't really know what's happening.
[3058.50 → 3059.02] Or care.
[3059.84 → 3060.08] Nice.
[3061.22 → 3062.08] Yeah, I don't know.
[3062.40 → 3064.76] I think it'll kind of depend on, like, the vibe.
[3065.38 → 3067.36] Like, am I speed cleaning?
[3068.36 → 3069.50] Maybe, like, metal or something.
[3069.66 → 3070.56] Just go for it.
[3070.70 → 3071.20] Let her rip.
[3072.28 → 3072.90] No metal.
[3073.42 → 3075.08] I don't really do metal.
[3075.28 → 3076.04] I don't really do, like,
[3076.12 → 3076.22] like,
[3076.28 → 3079.28] vocalists.
[3079.40 → 3080.56] I don't really find it appealing.
[3082.30 → 3083.38] That's probably my one thing.
[3083.78 → 3086.50] Yeah, I think the metal that I listen to doesn't have as much of that.
[3086.50 → 3089.44] I'm not 100% certain.
[3090.88 → 3091.76] But I think so.
[3093.42 → 3093.96] All right.
[3094.30 → 3094.82] Dan, hit us.
[3095.18 → 3095.32] Sure.
[3095.88 → 3098.94] Linus, I just had my second born last Saturday.
[3099.24 → 3101.42] Any tips to make it easier on the firstborn?
[3101.70 → 3105.16] They are both boys, so I want to build that brotherly bond.
[3106.98 → 3107.46] Communication.
[3108.54 → 3109.26] You know, be honest.
[3109.36 → 3110.98] Talk about, you know, what's going to be good.
[3111.06 → 3112.58] Talk about what's going to be not as good.
[3112.64 → 3116.16] Always make sure you only have one of anything and make them fight for it.
[3116.50 → 3118.50] Okay.
[3119.32 → 3121.98] He's being a bit of an ass about it,
[3122.08 → 3124.44] but he's actually kind of not wrong,
[3124.66 → 3126.72] because if you don't teach them to share,
[3127.32 → 3128.64] they're not going to learn later.
[3130.02 → 3130.88] So I,
[3131.02 → 3131.54] we,
[3131.82 → 3134.90] we go out of our way to buy one of things.
[3134.96 → 3135.26] In fact,
[3135.26 → 3136.14] you're going to see this.
[3136.34 → 3140.58] We've got an upcoming video where the kids asked for a karaoke setup.
[3140.58 → 3144.26] I am not a karaoke guy.
[3144.46 → 3144.84] I don't.
[3144.84 → 3145.84] Blue speaker and a phone.
[3145.94 → 3146.98] I don't know anything about it.
[3147.56 → 3148.60] But I was like,
[3148.66 → 3148.80] oh,
[3148.86 → 3148.98] well,
[3149.00 → 3157.20] there's an opportunity to offload the research for my child's birthday wish to one of our staff members.
[3157.20 → 3159.60] And all I have to do is make a video about it,
[3159.66 → 3164.12] which may actually be relevant because when I tried to do the research myself,
[3164.12 → 3167.32] I discovered that karaoke is one of those rabbit holes.
[3167.32 → 3170.14] That's like dash cams where it's just,
[3170.14 → 3173.02] it's just flooded with AliExpress garbage.
[3173.02 → 3173.90] Tons of products.
[3173.98 → 3174.70] You don't know which one's good.
[3174.90 → 3176.90] And no reliable information.
[3177.14 → 3177.32] Yeah.
[3177.40 → 3178.86] So we kind of came in, and we're like,
[3178.90 → 3179.18] okay,
[3179.34 → 3181.50] we're going to demystify.
[3181.62 → 3181.84] Anyway,
[3182.02 → 3182.54] when I,
[3182.68 → 3185.42] when I kind of have my hands on their eyes to be like,
[3185.48 → 3185.70] aha,
[3185.82 → 3186.22] reveal.
[3186.44 → 3186.86] I'm like,
[3186.88 → 3187.10] okay,
[3187.16 → 3192.42] you know how we do that thing where sometimes your birthday present is for everybody.
[3193.28 → 3193.64] Well,
[3193.68 → 3194.52] we're doing that again.
[3195.18 → 3195.58] And,
[3195.66 → 3197.76] and that is something that we do on a pretty regular.
[3197.96 → 3198.54] Cool way to do it.
[3198.58 → 3198.96] My opinion,
[3199.14 → 3200.18] a pretty regular basis.
[3200.18 → 3201.46] Like this,
[3201.76 → 3202.10] you know,
[3202.10 → 3203.48] is your birthday present,
[3203.48 → 3204.96] but it actually doesn't belong to you.
[3205.28 → 3205.66] Um,
[3205.68 → 3209.34] so another example of that is that water scooter thing,
[3209.74 → 3210.00] the
[3210.00 → 3210.92] the underwater scooter.
[3211.12 → 3211.36] Yep.
[3211.46 → 3211.90] Um,
[3212.70 → 3215.16] I bought that as a birthday present for my middle child.
[3215.54 → 3215.90] Uh,
[3215.90 → 3219.46] but I made it very clear when I gave it to the
[3219.56 → 3222.42] when I gave it to her that she got to ride it first.
[3222.56 → 3222.96] Sure.
[3223.14 → 3224.08] And beyond that,
[3224.08 → 3227.30] it was for everybody to enjoy.
[3227.32 → 3229.22] You can get some credit for maybe the idea.
[3229.72 → 3230.12] Yep.
[3230.18 → 3230.46] If it,
[3230.46 → 3231.84] if it like goes really well and was like,
[3231.84 → 3232.10] Oh yeah,
[3232.10 → 3232.60] this is great.
[3232.66 → 3232.94] It's like,
[3232.96 → 3233.10] Oh,
[3233.10 → 3233.76] thanks for,
[3233.76 → 3234.16] you know,
[3234.28 → 3235.48] requesting this or whatever.
[3235.74 → 3235.94] I don't know.
[3235.94 → 3236.10] Yep.
[3236.26 → 3236.82] That's cool.
[3237.00 → 3237.90] But you've got to,
[3238.00 → 3238.88] yeah,
[3238.96 → 3240.14] you've basically got to,
[3240.24 → 3240.82] um,
[3242.06 → 3245.04] you've basically got to set the ground rules now and,
[3245.22 → 3246.74] and you've got to micromanage it.
[3247.08 → 3247.46] Like,
[3247.70 → 3248.32] Oh man,
[3248.32 → 3251.34] I forget what kind of ridiculous passive-aggressive thing.
[3251.34 → 3253.08] One of the kids said to the other last night,
[3253.14 → 3253.76] but I was just like,
[3253.82 → 3254.00] Hey,
[3254.70 → 3255.82] that's rude.
[3256.62 → 3256.94] Um,
[3257.46 → 3258.62] what should you have said?
[3259.44 → 3261.12] And what do you need to say now?
[3261.20 → 3261.40] You know,
[3261.40 → 3262.64] you need to apologize now.
[3262.70 → 3262.92] Like,
[3263.06 → 3264.50] anyway,
[3264.88 → 3265.22] parenting.
[3265.62 → 3265.92] Okay.
[3266.00 → 3266.48] What's next?
[3268.94 → 3269.42] Oh yeah.
[3269.42 → 3270.16] Let's do another topic.
[3270.22 → 3270.80] What do you want to talk about?
[3270.86 → 3271.32] Do you do no more?
[3271.42 → 3271.84] I want it.
[3271.94 → 3272.18] Okay.
[3272.64 → 3272.92] No,
[3272.94 → 3273.76] let's do a real topic.
[3273.92 → 3274.22] Oh,
[3274.22 → 3276.14] I've wanted to see it the whole show.
[3276.64 → 3276.92] Okay.
[3276.92 → 3277.12] Uh,
[3277.12 → 3277.92] uh,
[3278.74 → 3279.16] SpaceX.
[3280.16 → 3280.60] Sure.
[3281.16 → 3281.86] Let's go.
[3282.28 → 3284.92] SpaceX literally catches a rocket midair.
[3285.22 → 3285.58] That's pretty cool.
[3285.70 → 3286.02] Uh,
[3286.02 → 3287.62] it's actually insane.
[3287.74 → 3289.50] SpaceX made history during its fifth flight,
[3289.60 → 3290.26] uh,
[3290.30 → 3290.64] for,
[3290.86 → 3291.06] uh,
[3291.06 → 3293.82] for the company's two stage starship vehicle this week,
[3293.82 → 3297.88] which is intended to take astronauts to the moon in the upcoming Artemis 3 mission.
[3297.88 → 3299.12] The rocket's first,
[3299.26 → 3300.80] and do many other things to be clear.
[3301.06 → 3302.10] The rocket's first stage,
[3302.30 → 3303.14] the super heavy booster,
[3303.44 → 3304.86] the most powerful booster ever made,
[3305.14 → 3306.78] not only carried the upper stage,
[3306.78 → 3307.66] sharp starship,
[3307.66 → 3308.16] uh,
[3308.16 → 3312.28] spacecraft to an altitude of 65 kilometres or 40 miles above the earth,
[3312.34 → 3313.84] but successfully separated.
[3313.84 → 3315.76] And then it says slowly descended,
[3315.96 → 3316.12] uh,
[3316.30 → 3320.96] very rapidly descended towards the extremely rapidly descended towards the launch tower.
[3321.22 → 3321.66] Um,
[3321.66 → 3323.12] after a breaking burn,
[3323.24 → 3324.72] which looks sick,
[3325.00 → 3328.12] the 71 meter or 233 feet,
[3328.12 → 3332.34] or some people are calling 19 story tall rocket boosters used,
[3332.42 → 3332.90] uh,
[3332.90 → 3334.48] just three of its 33 engines.
[3334.48 → 3335.78] That's also not correct,
[3336.14 → 3336.48] uh,
[3336.48 → 3339.00] to manoeuvre towards the tower's massive mechanical arms,
[3339.26 → 3339.56] which,
[3339.86 → 3340.14] uh,
[3340.24 → 3341.62] clasped onto the booster,
[3342.00 → 3342.44] sort of,
[3342.60 → 3343.88] I can explain that to in a moment,
[3344.16 → 3344.42] uh,
[3344.52 → 3345.50] catching it in midair,
[3345.66 → 3346.18] sort of,
[3346.46 → 3346.90] um,
[3346.98 → 3352.50] the starship spacecraft itself climbed to an altitude of 89 miles or 143 kilometres,
[3352.50 → 3354.86] and cruised towards the Indian Ocean,
[3355.22 → 3359.34] slowing itself from over 16,000 miles per hour to near zero,
[3359.34 → 3359.54] uh,
[3359.54 → 3360.46] uh,
[3360.46 → 3363.00] as it splashed down in the water as intended.
[3363.22 → 3363.70] Um,
[3363.70 → 3368.26] and it was cool how they did that because while they didn't catch the starship,
[3368.36 → 3372.40] it kind of like positioned itself as if it could have been,
[3372.40 → 3374.84] and then went into the water because they,
[3374.84 → 3377.36] they were still trying to test for telemetry stuff.
[3377.36 → 3377.80] So,
[3377.92 → 3380.38] there are some details about this that aren't immediately apparent.
[3380.92 → 3381.28] Um,
[3381.34 → 3383.00] Dan and I were talking about this before the show.
[3383.18 → 3383.98] Do you see the fins?
[3384.20 → 3385.24] Can you make this full screen?
[3386.58 → 3387.32] Do you see the fins?
[3388.34 → 3389.80] That's not what catches it.
[3390.34 → 3390.66] Mmm.
[3390.88 → 3394.10] The chopsticks or the arms also do not pinch it.
[3394.44 → 3394.72] Right.
[3394.80 → 3395.98] When they called it chopsticks,
[3396.10 → 3400.56] a lot of people imagined that it was like grabbing it and holding it with like friction or something.
[3400.70 → 3401.72] That's not what happened.
[3401.72 → 3402.44] Um,
[3402.44 → 3405.58] also the fins that come out that you can see are not what caught it.
[3405.88 → 3405.96] Right.
[3406.00 → 3408.26] There's these tiny little,
[3408.52 → 3409.26] in reality,
[3409.32 → 3410.42] they're like bigger than a person,
[3410.42 → 3413.30] but the thing's 16 or 19 stories tall or whatever.
[3413.44 → 3414.18] So it looks insane.
[3414.36 → 3416.52] Apparently it did use three engines for the manoeuvring.
[3416.56 → 3417.14] Sort of.
[3417.32 → 3419.20] It also used a lot more of that first,
[3419.44 → 3420.44] more than that first,
[3420.44 → 3421.74] and then went down to three.
[3421.86 → 3422.22] 13,
[3422.32 → 3422.76] then three.
[3422.92 → 3423.10] Yeah.
[3423.10 → 3423.62] Says Whammy,
[3423.62 → 3424.22] Whammy Heal.
[3424.34 → 3424.96] That is correct.
[3425.48 → 3425.88] Um,
[3426.18 → 3427.02] so yeah,
[3427.10 → 3427.40] there's,
[3427.48 → 3428.28] there's two,
[3428.84 → 3429.12] I'm,
[3429.24 → 3429.40] again,
[3429.42 → 3430.22] I'm saying little.
[3430.52 → 3430.96] They're,
[3430.96 → 3431.96] they're not that little,
[3432.02 → 3434.18] just in comparison to the structure.
[3434.34 → 3435.06] They're tiny.
[3435.24 → 3436.50] You can barely even see them.
[3436.62 → 3441.10] There's these two little tiny arms that come off the side and there's,
[3441.10 → 3441.72] uh,
[3441.74 → 3444.84] sections of the chopsticks that actually go up to touch them.
[3444.98 → 3448.20] So what's actually connecting is very small.
[3448.20 → 3449.52] And like even the
[3449.52 → 3451.86] the turn of the ship had to be perfect.
[3451.86 → 3452.26] Wow.
[3452.26 → 3455.44] So it didn't just have to be aligned like within the chopsticks at all.
[3455.50 → 3459.52] It also had to be turned to the like almost exact right angle, and they nailed it.
[3459.52 → 3462.68] I think I had a better angle of it,
[3462.74 → 3463.40] but realistically,
[3463.40 → 3464.20] um,
[3464.20 → 3466.32] you should just look it up yourself so that those people get the views.
[3466.56 → 3467.00] Um,
[3467.00 → 3470.16] but there are cameras that are closer where you can see those,
[3470.32 → 3471.86] those little arms that,
[3472.00 → 3473.54] that actually catch onto the chopsticks.
[3474.20 → 3474.60] Um,
[3475.02 → 3477.56] that was wild to watch.
[3477.64 → 3477.88] Super,
[3478.00 → 3478.58] super cool.
[3478.86 → 3479.88] Massive success there.
[3479.98 → 3481.02] First time they ever tried it,
[3481.06 → 3481.76] which is insane.
[3481.76 → 3482.82] Um,
[3483.98 → 3484.48] and,
[3484.48 → 3485.40] uh,
[3485.44 → 3486.14] also again,
[3486.14 → 3486.38] yeah,
[3486.38 → 3487.36] the starship itself,
[3487.36 → 3488.06] while it,
[3488.28 → 3488.58] you know,
[3488.58 → 3489.68] went into the water and blew up,
[3489.72 → 3491.14] that was entirely the tradition.
[3491.68 → 3491.96] Yeah.
[3492.32 → 3492.76] Um,
[3492.76 → 3493.16] but,
[3493.26 → 3497.50] but watching how it is like kind of came in and,
[3497.50 → 3500.86] and positioned itself nicely and then set into the water and then was like,
[3500.98 → 3501.10] cool.
[3501.10 → 3501.66] Mission complete,
[3501.72 → 3503.50] fell over and exploded was wild.
[3503.70 → 3507.44] They had these little buoys in the water, and you could tell it landed in the right spot
[3507.44 → 3511.56] because this buoy that I don't think they were controlling is just sitting there, and it comes
[3511.56 → 3512.80] right into view nicely.
[3513.16 → 3513.56] Um,
[3513.60 → 3514.48] but one of the
[3514.58 → 3516.08] if you watch the footage of the buoy,
[3516.26 → 3520.82] one of the like fragments of the starship flies and smacks the buoy.
[3521.24 → 3521.56] Nice.
[3521.94 → 3523.32] So it was like pretty close.
[3523.84 → 3524.28] Um,
[3524.60 → 3524.90] but yeah,
[3524.90 → 3525.32] that was,
[3525.42 → 3528.06] that was genuinely extremely cool to watch.
[3528.06 → 3529.68] And even if you're not super into space stuff,
[3529.68 → 3530.26] like this is,
[3530.36 → 3533.32] this is a mind-blowing feat of engineering.
[3533.52 → 3534.00] Um,
[3534.00 → 3534.48] watching,
[3534.76 → 3537.16] watching something 233 feet,
[3537.16 → 3537.96] caught tall,
[3538.68 → 3543.62] come flying in at crazy speed and then just catch itself is nuts.
[3543.90 → 3544.40] I mean,
[3544.40 → 3545.56] I'm impressed when my,
[3545.64 → 3547.58] my little handheld drone hovers.
[3547.78 → 3548.12] Yeah.
[3548.34 → 3548.80] You know,
[3548.98 → 3551.94] that's a lot easier to deal with this,
[3552.06 → 3552.26] this,
[3552.40 → 3553.26] this whole thing was,
[3553.26 → 3553.70] uh,
[3555.04 → 3555.26] yeah,
[3555.38 → 3555.84] extremely,
[3556.18 → 3557.20] extremely fun to witness.
[3557.20 → 3558.18] I'm happy that it happened.
[3559.96 → 3560.40] Um,
[3560.46 → 3561.32] what are we talking about next?
[3561.40 → 3562.66] What was our announcement topics?
[3562.94 → 3564.76] We moved the vacuum,
[3565.18 → 3565.68] the vacuum.
[3565.78 → 3565.96] Yeah.
[3566.08 → 3566.44] All right.
[3566.44 → 3569.58] Your vacuum is watching over the past several days.
[3569.58 → 3572.78] There have been widespread reports from owners of eco ACS,
[3572.78 → 3577.26] robot vacuums who say that their vacuums have started acting strangely,
[3577.26 → 3582.50] including screaming obscenities at their owners and chasing their pets.
[3582.50 → 3586.96] As it turns out,
[3586.96 → 3591.18] these vacuums were remotely accessed by bypassing their pin code,
[3591.32 → 3593.94] which does not use server side validation.
[3593.94 → 3595.20] Once hacked,
[3595.20 → 3595.50] once hacked,
[3595.50 → 3605.56] these maliciously controlled vacuums gave the hackers control of the vacuum and access to its video feed.
[3606.08 → 3608.20] At least one hacking victim,
[3608.50 → 3609.00] a lawyer,
[3609.88 → 3617.58] expressed relief that the vacuum had only been used to broadcast lurid language rather than used to silently spy on the household.
[3617.58 → 3618.14] Yeah.
[3618.14 → 3618.20] Yeah.
[3618.20 → 3618.58] Yeah.
[3618.58 → 3619.30] Eco ACS,
[3619.30 → 3622.72] the company was warned about this issue by security researchers.
[3622.72 → 3627.20] Get this back in December 2023.
[3627.20 → 3631.34] After security researchers spoke out publicly,
[3631.34 → 3640.84] eco ACS gave a statement to tech crunch saying they would not fix the security flaws pointed out by the researchers and telling users not to worry excessively about this.
[3640.84 → 3645.20] Earlier this month,
[3645.20 → 3654.92] the Australian Broadcasting Corporation successfully demonstrated that they could easily hack an eco ACS vacuum and used it to spy on a colleague's family without them noticing.
[3655.44 → 3662.92] This is in part because the vacuum doesn't play a camera recording warning sound unless it is being accessed from the eco ACS app.
[3663.32 → 3663.64] Note,
[3663.80 → 3665.84] this hack was performed with prior consent.
[3665.98 → 3666.10] Okay,
[3666.22 → 3666.38] cool.
[3667.40 → 3667.72] This,
[3667.82 → 3668.38] I didn't know.
[3668.98 → 3670.30] I had never heard of them before,
[3670.30 → 3673.98] but eco ACS vacuums are some of the most popular in the world,
[3674.32 → 3676.24] primarily because they are very cheap.
[3677.16 → 3678.84] Our discussion question here is,
[3679.08 → 3680.56] should we be more cautious about?
[3681.52 → 3683.20] And then it just kind of trails off there.
[3683.24 → 3683.56] That's fine.
[3683.62 → 3685.64] The team didn't have a lot of time to put together in the notes today.
[3686.06 → 3686.38] Um,
[3687.28 → 3687.70] uh,
[3687.74 → 3688.14] yes.
[3688.36 → 3688.72] Yeah.
[3688.72 → 3689.12] Yes.
[3689.24 → 3690.12] Discussion question.
[3690.32 → 3690.52] Yeah.
[3690.52 → 3692.14] We should be more cautious about.
[3692.92 → 3694.00] I think the
[3694.10 → 3697.96] the camera flip thing that was made for the Logitech C920s.
[3698.32 → 3700.14] I don't know if it was actually made by Logitech or not,
[3700.14 → 3701.14] but do you know what I'm talking about?
[3701.14 → 3701.32] It comes in the box.
[3701.48 → 3702.18] A little privacy screen.
[3702.18 → 3702.32] Yeah.
[3702.46 → 3702.64] I,
[3702.64 → 3703.30] I just,
[3703.40 → 3708.34] I just put all my C920s up that I got for the Land Centre last weekend.
[3708.34 → 3709.68] Because I finally got around to unboxing them.
[3709.68 → 3710.46] Maybe the newer ones do.
[3710.52 → 3711.34] My original one didn't.
[3711.40 → 3714.84] It comes with a little plastic clip, and it goes on the front, and then it's a little flappy door.
[3714.84 → 3716.34] A physical little thing.
[3717.02 → 3717.72] Oh man.
[3717.84 → 3719.56] If it was a physical little thing.
[3721.00 → 3721.40] Nope.
[3721.46 → 3721.58] No,
[3721.58 → 3722.28] that wouldn't make sense.
[3724.38 → 3727.82] I'm just not convinced that these robot vacuums actually save any time.
[3728.66 → 3729.76] Just because they kind of suck.
[3730.06 → 3730.40] Well,
[3730.56 → 3731.60] it's helpful for me.
[3731.60 → 3732.90] A do it.
[3733.60 → 3734.00] Um,
[3734.94 → 3739.80] maybe it's just because I've never had a house layout that's conducive to using them.
[3739.88 → 3740.78] Mine barely is,
[3740.86 → 3747.48] but with the constant mess that birds create and the actual ease of cleaning that mess up,
[3747.60 → 3751.36] it's nice just having something on routine that'll go through and do a pretty decent job.
[3751.60 → 3754.32] And then you can do a proper one every however long.
[3754.32 → 3754.76] Um,
[3754.76 → 3758.16] but having something go like every day or even twice a day to pick up,
[3758.24 → 3758.50] you know,
[3758.82 → 3761.36] the seed that they've thrown out of the cage or,
[3761.52 → 3764.28] or little bits of feather or whatever else,
[3764.54 → 3764.92] elf,
[3765.10 → 3766.78] whatever else is,
[3766.82 → 3767.56] is kind of nice.
[3767.80 → 3768.16] Okay.
[3769.04 → 3769.48] That's,
[3769.56 → 3770.36] that's a fair,
[3770.48 → 3771.36] that's a fair assessment.
[3771.48 → 3772.24] I guess for me,
[3772.24 → 3773.94] the issue was just at our old place,
[3773.94 → 3774.82] there were,
[3775.00 → 3781.14] there were so many transitions and the sunken living room and the multiple floors and the super complex,
[3781.14 → 3781.68] uh,
[3781.68 → 3782.44] upstairs layout.
[3782.44 → 3783.48] Like there was absolutely.
[3783.48 → 3785.84] It doesn't solve a lot of our problem.
[3786.38 → 3786.64] Yeah.
[3786.64 → 3787.22] It's mostly,
[3787.32 → 3787.74] it just,
[3787.84 → 3788.98] it mostly just helps the birds.
[3789.16 → 3789.50] I mean,
[3789.50 → 3792.90] there's a lot of people in chat that are saying they're super stoked on theirs.
[3792.96 → 3794.58] So there you go.
[3794.84 → 3796.30] And like we've,
[3796.38 → 3804.00] we've worked with a robot vacuum companies before that have had very impressive performance compared to the last time that I actually tried to use one at my house.
[3804.00 → 3806.08] So it's clear that they are advancing in a big way.
[3806.20 → 3810.38] It's just that our layout just doesn't work for it.
[3810.38 → 3810.64] Yeah.
[3810.70 → 3811.26] I think for us,
[3811.26 → 3811.86] it's like we,
[3811.86 → 3815.06] we take a problem area and make it no longer a problem.
[3815.16 → 3818.26] So it takes cleaning from this like annoying thing that you have to do practically,
[3818.26 → 3821.78] literally all the time to something you can do on a more reasonable schedule.
[3821.88 → 3826.28] I think a part of it is also me just making the mistake of putting in wall-to-wall carpeting every time.
[3826.28 → 3827.12] Yeah.
[3827.12 → 3829.46] I should have just not done any wall to wall in the new place.
[3829.56 → 3830.48] That was really dumb.
[3831.66 → 3833.52] But Yvonne and I both like it on our feelies.
[3834.14 → 3835.92] But then we have hardwood in the bedroom anyway.
[3836.36 → 3836.98] So like,
[3837.10 → 3839.02] why did we even,
[3839.52 → 3840.02] anyway.
[3840.02 → 3843.06] I am a wall-to-wall carpet enjoyer,
[3843.06 → 3844.26] but when the birds were at the vet,
[3844.30 → 3844.94] not that long ago,
[3844.94 → 3847.16] we did like emergency hyper deep clean.
[3847.16 → 3848.90] And we like borrowed,
[3848.90 → 3849.52] uh,
[3849.80 → 3851.06] Emma's dad's like,
[3851.20 → 3851.72] uh,
[3851.72 → 3854.32] deep carpet cleaner thing and stuff like that.
[3854.32 → 3854.76] Yeah.
[3854.76 → 3855.00] Yeah.
[3855.00 → 3858.12] And went hard, and it was gross.
[3858.30 → 3858.72] Yeah.
[3858.80 → 3859.82] Carpets are gross.
[3859.86 → 3861.50] They're kind of not sanitary.
[3862.20 → 3862.94] It's like,
[3863.04 → 3863.62] wow.
[3864.58 → 3866.48] There's a lot of stuff coming out of this.
[3867.26 → 3867.92] They're fine.
[3867.96 → 3868.98] If you just never check,
[3869.16 → 3871.52] it's like most things in life.
[3872.12 → 3872.60] Yeah.
[3873.52 → 3874.04] Anyway,
[3874.04 → 3875.18] we should check out our sponsors.
[3875.60 → 3875.92] Yeah.
[3877.98 → 3878.42] Sorry,
[3878.62 → 3881.44] Dan freaking out here.
[3883.38 → 3887.70] Acronis as much as some people thrive when under a cyberattack.
[3888.50 → 3889.38] That is me.
[3889.46 → 3890.92] That is legitimately me.
[3891.10 → 3892.20] I think we can all agree.
[3892.20 → 3896.60] It's best to prevent them from happening in the first place with a Kronos cyber protect.
[3896.60 → 3900.72] You get access to a set of security backup and recovery tools,
[3900.72 → 3905.54] all nicely packaged into one platform with a single console and one click simplicity.
[3905.88 → 3910.36] You'll be armed with cutting edge ammo to stop attacks before they can do too much damage,
[3910.48 → 3911.86] such as endpoint detection.
[3912.20 → 3912.68] And,
[3912.68 → 3913.48] uh,
[3913.48 → 3920.58] you can continuously monitor abnormal activity and use URL filtering to block access to potentially malicious websites.
[3920.58 → 3922.56] But as prepared as you can be,
[3922.68 → 3925.68] sometimes things slip through the cracks and disaster happens.
[3926.04 → 3926.68] But with a Kronos,
[3926.74 → 3929.00] you'll be protected with geo redundant cloud storage.
[3929.10 → 3932.22] So your precious files are automatically backed up to multiple locations.
[3932.22 → 3935.52] And getting access to those files is a breeze.
[3935.52 → 3937.82] Thanks to a Kronos's instant restore feature,
[3937.94 → 3940.14] which launches your backup as a virtual machine.
[3940.30 → 3940.72] Super cool.
[3940.90 → 3945.16] So bring your data protection and cybersecurity together with a Kronos cyber protect at go.
[3945.32 → 3947.82] Kronis.com slash WAN show.

[3955.04 → 3956.86] and of course squares.
[3957.44 → 3960.76] But if you take a look at the Linus media group website,
[3960.90 → 3962.52] you'll see squares all over the place.
[3962.68 → 3962.76] Oh,
[3962.92 → 3964.52] it's almost like a conspiracy.
[3965.52 → 3968.94] But what's not too deep is how simple it was to build our site.
[3968.98 → 3970.16] Thanks to Squarespace.

[4038.20 → 4039.68] You want to game on this thing?
[4039.98 → 4040.20] Well,
[4040.22 → 4045.78] how does a one 44 Hertz refresh rate and 0.03 millisecond greater great response time sound?
[4045.78 → 4047.60] It even has a built-in KVM.
[4047.94 → 4049.08] So if you're working off your laptop,

[4072.94 → 4073.38] Oh,
[4073.44 → 4074.42] we're supposed to do merch messages.
[4074.54 → 4074.72] All right,
[4074.76 → 4074.92] Dan,
[4074.98 → 4075.24] hit me.
[4075.46 → 4075.80] Yeah.
[4076.20 → 4076.62] Yeah.
[4077.16 → 4077.50] Yeah.
[4077.76 → 4078.02] Yeah.
[4078.42 → 4078.62] Hi,
[4078.64 → 4078.84] DLL.
[4078.96 → 4082.48] My seven-year-old lately has shown interest in computer science,
[4082.66 → 4083.50] especially cybersecurity,
[4084.02 → 4088.32] considering getting him a PC to game on and explore his curiosity in the field.
[4088.32 → 4093.04] Any suggestions on how to safely or the operating system?
[4094.16 → 4096.46] How to safely the operating system?
[4096.62 → 4096.86] Sorry,
[4096.86 → 4097.90] punctuation.
[4098.06 → 4098.98] How to do so safely.
[4098.98 → 4099.74] How to do so safely.
[4099.76 → 4101.02] Or what operating system they should use.
[4101.22 → 4101.28] Oh,
[4101.40 → 4101.48] I,
[4101.60 → 4102.08] yeah,
[4102.24 → 4102.96] I'm looking at,
[4103.08 → 4103.38] I don't know,
[4103.38 → 4104.28] I don't know what they mean by this,
[4104.36 → 4104.46] but.
[4104.60 → 4105.66] Throw them at Linux Young.
[4105.96 → 4106.24] Um,
[4107.00 → 4111.76] Windows's parental management tools are still terrible.
[4112.82 → 4114.38] Like they are sort of a disaster.
[4114.60 → 4115.48] Arch or get a new kid.
[4115.58 → 4116.62] Like you can set them up.
[4116.62 → 4116.78] Yeah,
[4116.88 → 4121.44] give them Arch and then the parental management tools is they won't be able to do anything.
[4121.62 → 4122.62] Just disowned.
[4123.46 → 4124.20] That's kind of interesting.
[4124.42 → 4125.84] If they can figure out how to do it,
[4125.94 → 4126.10] then.
[4126.10 → 4127.92] I guess they're older.
[4127.98 → 4128.76] Maybe they are.
[4128.86 → 4130.18] They'll be ready by the time they're 18.
[4130.22 → 4131.52] Maybe they deserve it.
[4133.38 → 4133.74] Okay.
[4134.36 → 4134.96] If honestly,
[4135.04 → 4136.88] if they're super into computers and stuff,
[4137.02 → 4142.32] I don't think giving them the like easiest thing is even probably going to be what they want.
[4142.76 → 4143.10] Um,
[4143.10 → 4145.26] I would throw them at some form of Linux.
[4145.26 → 4145.28] How about Ubuntu?
[4145.60 → 4148.64] Could we at least give them something that can kind of do some stuff out of the box?
[4148.72 → 4148.92] Maybe,
[4148.92 → 4153.98] maybe recommend them to mess around with no GUI modes and stuff.
[4154.72 → 4155.28] There's seven.
[4155.68 → 4155.84] Yeah.
[4156.52 → 4157.16] There's seven,
[4157.16 → 4160.78] but they're expressing interest in cybersecurity.
[4160.78 → 4160.94] Behind the curse.
[4160.94 → 4160.98] Behind the curse.
[4160.98 → 4161.04] Behind the curse.
[4161.04 → 4161.48] Behind the curse.
[4161.48 → 4164.26] Arch console to a cybersecurity kid.
[4164.26 → 4165.36] He's going to feel like a hacker.
[4165.48 → 4165.76] Remember,
[4165.86 → 4166.80] this is from a parent.
[4167.26 → 4167.48] You know,
[4167.62 → 4169.22] parents will see their kid like,
[4169.32 → 4170.74] Do you want to do cybersecurity?
[4170.74 → 4171.22] Like,
[4171.34 → 4174.92] get their hands like covered in drool and like smear it on a piece of paper.
[4175.04 → 4176.30] Do you want to stop the big scary hackers?
[4176.32 → 4176.34] Oh,
[4176.34 → 4177.40] he's interested in art.
[4177.90 → 4178.14] Like,
[4178.28 → 4179.24] you never know,
[4179.34 → 4179.42] right?
[4179.46 → 4179.76] I don't know.
[4179.76 → 4182.02] I'm not saying Eric is like that.
[4182.06 → 4183.68] I'm just saying it's a possibility.
[4184.38 → 4184.70] Um,
[4184.76 → 4185.30] there's seven.
[4185.46 → 4185.90] So like,
[4185.96 → 4187.60] I think it should at least have a GUI.
[4187.84 → 4188.04] Sure.
[4188.22 → 4188.40] Like,
[4188.42 → 4189.22] don't be like that.
[4189.36 → 4189.56] Yeah.
[4189.70 → 4190.86] He could just install it himself.
[4191.78 → 4192.06] Yeah.
[4192.06 → 4192.90] Or do it with him.
[4193.20 → 4193.38] Yeah.
[4193.44 → 4194.56] Teach him how to install a GUI.
[4194.68 → 4194.84] Yeah.
[4194.84 → 4195.32] That's fun.
[4195.50 → 4195.98] That sounds like.
[4195.98 → 4197.36] There are some games that feature,
[4197.36 → 4198.08] um,
[4198.08 → 4198.76] hacking elements.
[4198.76 → 4200.32] I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head right now.
[4200.34 → 4201.08] It's pretty old,
[4201.50 → 4202.26] but it was cool.
[4202.78 → 4203.70] I don't remember the name of it.
[4203.74 → 4204.34] What was that?
[4204.34 → 4204.76] Blue screen.
[4205.16 → 4205.48] Uh,
[4206.18 → 4208.02] what was that like educational,
[4208.02 → 4210.06] like platform thing?
[4210.72 → 4211.00] Uplink.
[4211.12 → 4211.60] Uplink.
[4211.68 → 4211.96] Uplink.
[4211.96 → 4212.64] Thank you.
[4212.78 → 4213.70] I loved that game.
[4213.80 → 4214.02] Yeah.
[4214.16 → 4214.58] Still do.
[4214.76 → 4215.08] Uplink.
[4215.24 → 4215.58] It could be fun.
[4216.26 → 4216.66] Hackney.
[4216.82 → 4216.98] Yeah.
[4217.46 → 4217.94] Um,
[4217.98 → 4218.52] there's a
[4218.62 → 4218.98] there's a
[4218.98 → 4223.80] a website that is good for learning cybersecurity stuff that I also can't remember the name
[4223.80 → 4224.26] of right now.
[4224.26 → 4226.32] I was going to use chat for,
[4226.38 → 4226.68] um,
[4227.56 → 4227.84] you know,
[4227.84 → 4228.46] everything,
[4228.60 → 4228.98] I guess,
[4229.46 → 4229.76] um,
[4229.76 → 4230.44] hack the box.
[4230.58 → 4231.24] There we go.
[4231.38 → 4232.42] What was that one that,
[4232.54 → 4232.82] um,
[4232.82 → 4233.24] thank you.
[4233.38 → 4236.24] What was that one that came with a raspberry pie that you would build?
[4236.32 → 4236.50] Oh,
[4236.70 → 4237.26] uh,
[4237.30 → 4241.34] and it had like a bunch of like sorts of coding friendly,
[4241.34 → 4242.76] um,
[4242.98 → 4243.44] games.
[4243.44 → 4244.18] Like it had,
[4244.30 → 4244.62] um,
[4244.70 → 4245.50] I don't remember.
[4245.74 → 4246.32] Oh man.
[4246.40 → 4246.60] Kano.
[4246.72 → 4246.84] Yeah.
[4246.86 → 4247.06] Yeah.
[4247.18 → 4247.72] I can't Kano.
[4247.84 → 4248.08] Kano.
[4248.20 → 4248.40] Kano.
[4248.54 → 4248.64] Sure.
[4248.76 → 4248.96] Yeah.
[4249.60 → 4249.84] Uh,
[4249.84 → 4251.42] and I think you can just get the software.
[4252.10 → 4252.46] Like,
[4252.50 → 4252.66] I don't,
[4252.72 → 4253.28] I think you can,
[4253.40 → 4253.50] I,
[4253.58 → 4254.16] I mean,
[4254.20 → 4254.94] don't quote me on that.
[4254.94 → 4258.76] Are they still around separately getting them into the scratch programming language?
[4259.28 → 4259.80] Um,
[4259.88 → 4260.28] scratches,
[4260.60 → 4261.02] in my opinion,
[4261.10 → 4262.84] genuinely a pretty solid way to,
[4262.92 → 4265.80] to learn the basics of things.
[4267.10 → 4271.32] Kano world is relaunching in partnership with Astro safe and fin.
[4272.32 → 4272.80] Okay.
[4272.80 → 4277.70] So that's something more.
[4278.34 → 4278.68] Yeah.
[4278.80 → 4279.08] Hit me.
[4279.40 → 4279.56] Yeah.
[4280.30 → 4287.08] Some of my favourite content was the crazy multi-monitor 16 K gaming type deals with a lack of SLI.
[4287.20 → 4288.44] Are projects like that even possible?
[4288.60 → 4290.46] How do we push hardware peripheral limits?
[4291.24 → 4291.60] Um,
[4292.12 → 4294.56] actually that project did not use SLI.
[4294.66 → 4296.92] It used a squadron multi-sync.
[4296.92 → 4304.08] So it had four individual cards that were driving the monitors individually.
[4304.36 → 4312.38] And then it had a separate fifth sync card that each of those cards was linked into that handled all the synchronization of the image.
[4312.44 → 4313.38] That's why it was a little,
[4313.64 → 4314.76] a little,
[4314.88 → 4315.78] a little wonky.
[4316.26 → 4316.74] Um,
[4316.80 → 4319.90] that to my knowledge still kind of exists,
[4320.18 → 4326.76] but I think the challenge for us is that we want to find new things to explore.
[4326.98 → 4330.16] I would also say resolution pumping was like a big thing back then.
[4330.30 → 4331.52] It's not really a thing anymore.
[4331.56 → 4332.22] Now we all agree.
[4332.28 → 4333.00] It's kind of stupid.
[4333.16 → 4333.32] Yeah.
[4333.38 → 4336.56] Like we're definitely going to do a video gaming in 8K on the 50,
[4336.62 → 4337.38] 90 or whatever,
[4337.38 → 4338.28] when it comes out.
[4338.30 → 4342.02] But do we need to game at 16 K?
[4342.38 → 4343.20] I don't know.
[4343.32 → 4343.92] Maybe not.
[4343.92 → 4344.28] That,
[4344.28 → 4349.30] that one dude who spends his entire life modding a cyberpunk will care.
[4349.96 → 4350.20] Yeah.
[4350.72 → 4351.16] Yeah,
[4351.24 → 4351.74] exactly.
[4351.98 → 4352.22] So,
[4352.74 → 4353.06] um,
[4353.12 → 4353.28] like,
[4353.32 → 4353.58] okay.
[4353.66 → 4354.28] Like we,
[4355.20 → 4355.60] uh,
[4355.60 → 4358.30] like one of the things that people love is us using,
[4358.30 → 4358.78] you know,
[4358.84 → 4360.88] wacky fans to cool things.
[4360.88 → 4361.08] Right.
[4361.10 → 4366.48] So we had that one where we rented those like industrial fans, and we hooked them up to that
[4366.48 → 4370.54] cooler master case with like a plywood duct, and it like blew the top of the case off.
[4370.60 → 4371.10] That was great.
[4371.26 → 4373.30] And then we had the one where we,
[4373.30 → 4373.72] uh,
[4373.72 → 4375.14] hooked up that like bigger,
[4375.26 → 4379.94] like almost looked like a jet turbine fan to a computer and ran it off of like lip batteries.
[4379.94 → 4383.50] But what you'll notice about those two things is that while they both had fans connected,
[4383.50 → 4385.64] there were sorts of different things that we could explore.
[4385.82 → 4389.96] So the second one ended up being more about the lip batteries and less about just the fan,
[4390.42 → 4390.76] you know?
[4390.96 → 4391.28] Uh,
[4391.28 → 4391.58] so we,
[4391.60 → 4392.02] we want,
[4392.22 → 4394.32] we want there to be something new for us to talk about.
[4394.46 → 4397.88] We did another like wacky fan video just now,
[4397.88 → 4398.44] uh,
[4398.44 → 4401.48] where we used a turbo to cool a computer.
[4401.48 → 4402.52] Um,
[4403.24 → 4408.22] which is Alex and I sort of agree.
[4408.38 → 4410.42] Maybe the stupidest thing we've ever done,
[4410.42 → 4415.06] but the difference,
[4415.20 → 4421.36] the difference is that what makes it not jumping the shark is that there's new learning outcomes.
[4421.50 → 4421.86] Okay.
[4422.06 → 4424.00] We discuss what a turbo is.
[4424.00 → 4428.82] We discuss why a conventional one might not work and why we might want to use,
[4428.82 → 4429.40] um,
[4429.40 → 4430.44] uh,
[4430.44 → 4433.28] an electric turbo or a supercharger exhaust fed.
[4433.52 → 4433.84] Uh,
[4433.84 → 4434.02] yeah,
[4434.16 → 4434.40] yeah,
[4434.46 → 4434.74] normally,
[4434.86 → 4435.54] but you know,
[4435.54 → 4436.28] computer,
[4436.42 → 4436.66] I mean,
[4436.66 → 4437.32] it has exhaust,
[4437.42 → 4438.12] but not like that.
[4438.60 → 4439.04] Um,
[4439.10 → 4440.06] just pulled your car up.
[4440.10 → 4444.74] We talk about the challenges with the high pressure and therefore high temperature of the
[4444.74 → 4446.40] turbos exhaust air,
[4446.40 → 4447.04] uh,
[4447.04 → 4447.98] or shouldn't say exhaust,
[4448.08 → 4448.68] but it's output.
[4448.68 → 4451.50] Cause when you say exhaust in automotive terms,
[4451.50 → 4452.46] it sounds like the exhaust,
[4452.56 → 4453.16] not that the
[4453.16 → 4453.34] the
[4453.34 → 4454.60] like the output from the turbo,
[4454.60 → 4454.78] the
[4454.84 → 4455.44] the fresh air,
[4455.50 → 4456.16] uh,
[4456.16 → 4456.74] from the turbo.
[4456.90 → 4457.46] So it,
[4457.54 → 4458.74] so the air is actually hot.
[4458.74 → 4459.60] So then we,
[4459.78 → 4462.44] we discuss intercoolers, and we use an intercooler.
[4462.58 → 4463.04] And anyway,
[4463.04 → 4463.26] it's,
[4463.30 → 4464.64] it's a really great video,
[4464.64 → 4468.30] but it's more than just taking a big fan and hooking it up to a computer because we've
[4468.30 → 4468.86] already done that.
[4468.86 → 4470.72] And we try not to do the same things over and over.
[4471.44 → 4473.02] Does Alex like travelling?
[4473.14 → 4473.26] Like,
[4473.30 → 4474.44] does he go to Computer?
[4474.52 → 4474.92] I don't remember.
[4475.10 → 4475.76] I don't think he was here.
[4475.76 → 4477.22] I think Alex usually does.
[4477.42 → 4477.70] Um,
[4477.70 → 4479.56] I don't know if he did Computer last time,
[4479.56 → 4479.86] but he,
[4479.92 → 4480.66] he does CES.
[4480.82 → 4481.60] I think there's a
[4481.70 → 4482.82] there's a maybe possibility.
[4482.82 → 4483.90] If you guys are interested,
[4484.04 → 4484.32] maybe,
[4484.46 → 4485.88] maybe I haven't actually asked anyone,
[4485.88 → 4486.22] maybe,
[4486.72 → 4487.22] um,
[4487.40 → 4488.32] that you could do.
[4488.36 → 4489.64] I think Alex did do Computer this year.
[4489.64 → 4491.96] A fanless computer build.
[4492.54 → 4492.94] Um,
[4492.94 → 4496.42] but in a wind tunnel and try to cool it that way and see what happens.
[4496.48 → 4496.84] I'd be down.
[4497.24 → 4498.40] There's another one I want to do.
[4498.46 → 4498.88] I want to,
[4498.96 → 4501.32] I want to put a computer in a hyperbaric chamber.
[4501.80 → 4502.12] Oh,
[4502.22 → 4502.48] nice.
[4502.48 → 4504.88] I want to know what like denser air does.
[4505.00 → 4505.18] Yeah.
[4505.22 → 4505.50] Why not?
[4505.56 → 4505.90] I don't know.
[4506.04 → 4506.52] That's cool.
[4506.74 → 4507.94] I love stuff like that.
[4508.06 → 4508.44] Um,
[4508.50 → 4510.08] we also still have pending,
[4510.66 → 4511.04] um,
[4511.08 → 4514.54] actually maybe I shouldn't talk too much about these cause these might take us a while to execute.
[4515.48 → 4515.96] Never mind.
[4516.68 → 4518.06] The ideas' doc is like,
[4518.10 → 4518.24] we're,
[4518.26 → 4519.12] we're not out of ideas.
[4519.48 → 4519.74] Um,
[4520.08 → 4520.28] we,
[4520.30 → 4520.56] we got,
[4520.66 → 4521.26] we got more ideas.
[4521.26 → 4522.94] I wonder what the oldest thing on it is.
[4523.80 → 4524.92] I wonder how old it is.
[4525.10 → 4525.74] I have no idea.
[4525.86 → 4528.60] I'd have to go back to like every revision.
[4528.60 → 4529.88] I did my oldest idea.
[4530.34 → 4531.08] That's not bad.
[4531.22 → 4531.36] You know,
[4531.38 → 4532.24] it could be kind of fun too.
[4532.24 → 4532.72] It's like my,
[4532.78 → 4534.22] my three worst ideas.
[4534.34 → 4535.16] And you do like,
[4535.58 → 4535.78] you,
[4535.86 → 4538.82] you have the writers vote on like what the three worst ideas in the doc are.
[4538.88 → 4540.26] And you do all three of them in one video.
[4540.56 → 4541.52] You just do like,
[4542.34 → 4542.66] I don't know.
[4542.70 → 4543.30] I'm kind of down.
[4543.54 → 4543.90] Anyway,
[4544.14 → 4545.32] uh,
[4545.32 → 4546.42] I'm going to send that to myself.
[4546.92 → 4547.28] Sick.
[4547.98 → 4548.66] Let's go.
[4550.48 → 4550.88] Uh,
[4552.16 → 4553.52] yeah.
[4553.66 → 4554.40] What are we on?
[4554.46 → 4554.96] We're on topics.
[4555.06 → 4555.38] Okay.
[4557.20 → 4557.56] Sure.
[4559.08 → 4560.56] SpaceX catching the rocket.
[4560.80 → 4561.66] We already talked about that.
[4561.66 → 4562.52] I fanboyed enough.
[4562.62 → 4563.56] I could go in for hours.
[4563.64 → 4564.50] It is what it is.
[4565.32 → 4565.76] Um,
[4569.44 → 4570.98] Linus struggling with his stream.
[4572.34 → 4572.74] Oh,
[4573.16 → 4576.00] Linus is having streaming issues with his VR PC.
[4576.00 → 4576.44] Yeah.
[4576.44 → 4577.00] So I was,
[4577.10 → 4577.60] I did a
[4577.68 → 4581.66] I did a VR stream last night and I don't know what it is about this machine,
[4581.66 → 4583.56] but it was perfect for a long time.
[4583.72 → 4585.90] And now whenever I stream,
[4585.90 → 4592.76] I get this like stutter in VR and I don't feel like the load I'm putting on it is super
[4592.76 → 4593.18] crazy.
[4593.18 → 4594.06] I'm running an index,
[4594.06 → 4595.86] so it's high resolution,
[4595.86 → 4599.72] but it's not up there with the best headsets these days anymore.
[4599.72 → 4600.70] Not by a long shot.
[4601.16 → 4602.78] And I'm streaming at 10 ADP,
[4603.38 → 4603.74] um,
[4603.82 → 4604.02] you know,
[4604.02 → 4604.74] six megabit.
[4605.18 → 4605.56] Um,
[4605.56 → 4607.08] but when I use NV ENC,
[4607.44 → 4607.82] uh,
[4607.86 → 4608.00] Oh,
[4608.14 → 4611.58] one of the things that is a little bit challenging is I'm using live for,
[4611.58 → 4612.36] um,
[4612.56 → 4612.68] to,
[4612.84 → 4614.24] for like a virtual avatar.
[4614.24 → 4615.14] So it has to,
[4615.64 → 4615.90] yeah.
[4616.12 → 4616.58] Um,
[4616.58 → 4618.10] it has to do some compositing,
[4618.10 → 4619.32] but like,
[4619.32 → 4623.38] I don't get it because CPU usage sits around like 40%.
[4623.38 → 4625.84] GPU usage is what it is.
[4625.88 → 4627.24] And if you're using NV ENC for encoding,
[4627.38 → 4628.62] it should like be fine.
[4629.18 → 4629.62] Um,
[4630.32 → 4632.68] but I think I'm going to have to,
[4632.74 → 4634.20] I think I'm going to have to rebuild it.
[4634.62 → 4634.98] Um,
[4636.22 → 4636.78] Elijah says,
[4636.84 → 4638.04] I promise it's your CPU.
[4638.40 → 4638.80] Uh,
[4638.84 → 4641.46] your GPU is trying to comp and ends up with more overhead on it.
[4641.52 → 4644.46] It happens with my old computer that that's very possible.
[4644.72 → 4646.38] When's the first time you ever overclock something?
[4646.48 → 4647.42] I have a 3600.
[4648.44 → 4648.84] So,
[4648.84 → 4651.38] it's,
[4651.60 → 4652.26] it's,
[4652.26 → 4654.40] it's not a super high core count machine.
[4655.00 → 4655.52] Um,
[4655.52 → 4656.82] so it's possible that I'm,
[4656.92 → 4657.98] that I am running into some,
[4658.04 → 4658.86] some CPU issues.
[4659.08 → 4660.02] DSP latency spikes.
[4661.02 → 4661.44] A what now?
[4661.60 → 4665.20] DSP latency spikes can often be caused by NVIDIA drivers.
[4665.58 → 4668.78] It hits the audio and causes hitches like that or little pops.
[4668.78 → 4669.44] It's not audio.
[4669.68 → 4669.78] No,
[4669.82 → 4670.42] the audio is fine.
[4670.52 → 4670.62] no,
[4670.72 → 4670.74] no,
[4670.74 → 4670.76] no,
[4670.76 → 4675.90] it like interrupts the system badly and like causes really weird issues like that.
[4675.98 → 4676.34] Interesting.
[4676.58 → 4678.68] And this is what an NVIDIA driver issue you said?
[4678.68 → 4680.20] Most of the time it is NVIDIA drivers.
[4680.32 → 4681.86] You can use something like,
[4681.86 → 4682.56] uh,
[4683.30 → 4683.70] I don't know.
[4683.76 → 4683.92] There's,
[4683.92 → 4684.72] there are tools out there.
[4684.82 → 4686.10] I think it's called process.
[4686.30 → 4686.54] No,
[4686.74 → 4687.24] uh,
[4688.02 → 4689.02] DSP latency.
[4689.70 → 4689.94] Okay.
[4689.94 → 4691.54] I have another theory.
[4692.46 → 4692.98] Latency Mon.
[4693.06 → 4693.38] That's it.
[4693.90 → 4695.24] This windows install.
[4696.12 → 4696.56] Oh yeah.
[4696.66 → 4696.86] I mean,
[4696.96 → 4699.14] has made its way all the way from windows seven.
[4700.76 → 4701.16] Okay.
[4701.54 → 4702.00] Okay.
[4702.00 → 4703.68] But through windows eight,
[4703.68 → 4704.70] I didn't know that.
[4704.76 → 4705.34] And I was going to say,
[4705.42 → 4708.50] start there through 10 through 11.
[4708.70 → 4709.66] It is now 11.
[4709.78 → 4710.10] I didn't,
[4710.16 → 4710.96] did you 8.1 it?
[4711.34 → 4711.68] Uh,
[4711.68 → 4712.34] I don't remember.
[4712.66 → 4713.94] I had never,
[4713.94 → 4716.86] I had never intended to,
[4716.86 → 4718.46] to Windows 11 it,
[4718.64 → 4721.16] but one of my kids just like clicked.
[4721.32 → 4721.68] Okay.
[4721.94 → 4723.38] Upgrade at some point.
[4723.56 → 4724.18] And I am good,
[4724.38 → 4724.92] it's free.
[4725.68 → 4726.18] And I was like,
[4726.38 → 4726.70] okay,
[4726.84 → 4730.12] it has had at least three different motherboards.
[4730.92 → 4733.44] So I may just need to reformat my computer.
[4733.78 → 4734.00] Yeah.
[4734.24 → 4734.54] It's,
[4734.64 → 4735.72] it's my VR machine.
[4735.92 → 4736.14] Yeah.
[4736.24 → 4736.36] Yeah.
[4736.46 → 4738.36] So I,
[4738.42 → 4740.78] I think from the original video where I built it,
[4740.80 → 4743.44] I just like grabbed a drive, and it like already had windows on it.
[4744.06 → 4748.02] So it's probably from a completely different system originally.
[4748.20 → 4748.40] Oh yeah.
[4748.40 → 4749.82] And then it's had multiple different motherboards.
[4749.82 → 4749.88] Oh yeah.
[4749.88 → 4750.28] A hundred percent.
[4750.40 → 4750.76] Nice.
[4751.00 → 4751.14] Yeah.
[4751.14 → 4751.46] So,
[4751.64 → 4752.62] so that might also be it.
[4754.26 → 4754.66] Yeah.
[4754.66 → 4755.14] I will,
[4755.20 → 4755.76] I will say I,
[4755.76 → 4756.18] I,
[4756.18 → 4758.60] I threw fake shade at Elijah.
[4758.78 → 4759.50] I will say,
[4759.56 → 4760.06] uh,
[4760.14 → 4763.64] Elijah was the only person to set the screen saver in the young people.
[4763.72 → 4765.54] Try Windows XP video.
[4765.54 → 4766.96] The way I would have done it.
[4769.24 → 4770.32] I couldn't believe.
[4770.32 → 4772.72] That video was extremely fun.
[4773.12 → 4773.56] And,
[4773.66 → 4774.76] Oh,
[4774.76 → 4779.40] deeply infuriating at times.
[4779.40 → 4780.92] The CD dual case.
[4781.10 → 4781.42] Oh,
[4781.78 → 4782.12] yeah,
[4782.16 → 4783.88] I know that actually killed your soul.
[4783.88 → 4785.56] Like I talked about,
[4785.66 → 4787.12] I talked about this with Luke after.
[4787.94 → 4790.00] If you don't know how they work.
[4790.02 → 4790.80] There's a spine on it.
[4790.90 → 4791.60] There's a spine.
[4791.90 → 4792.56] There's a spine.
[4792.90 → 4793.86] If you don't know.
[4793.86 → 4794.74] There's a clear pivot point.
[4795.26 → 4796.82] You open at the opposite end.
[4797.36 → 4797.64] Luke,
[4798.00 → 4799.08] if you've never.
[4799.44 → 4799.48] If,
[4799.48 → 4800.12] close your laptop.
[4800.22 → 4800.70] How do you open it?
[4800.76 → 4801.02] I don't know.
[4801.02 → 4807.10] Even some cardboard boxes can be a little bit challenging,
[4807.10 → 4812.24] even though you can clearly see which way it's supposed to open because of the way it like comes over and in or whatever.
[4812.62 → 4815.40] I don't think to someone who's never seen one before.
[4815.52 → 4817.08] I don't think it's immediately obvious.
[4817.08 → 4822.40] Even though I know how to open them,
[4822.46 → 4824.00] I have struggled with CD jewel cases,
[4824.10 → 4825.24] especially when they're brand new.
[4825.34 → 4826.00] Crack it open?
[4826.14 → 4826.32] Well,
[4826.68 → 4827.08] yeah,
[4827.22 → 4827.54] I'd like,
[4827.58 → 4828.36] I know the techniques,
[4828.52 → 4829.24] but like a nut,
[4829.40 → 4830.98] but I'm talking about like my whole life.
[4830.98 → 4832.44] Like at some point in my life,
[4832.44 → 4833.38] I didn't know that.
[4833.60 → 4836.72] And like when they're brand new, and they're like,
[4836.80 → 4836.96] they're,
[4837.02 → 4837.90] they're kind of sharp.
[4837.96 → 4839.88] And the first time they were ever put together,
[4839.94 → 4840.18] I don't know,
[4840.18 → 4841.24] maybe they were warm still.
[4841.56 → 4842.24] They can be a little crack.
[4842.24 → 4843.74] They can be a little hard to get open.
[4843.76 → 4844.14] The seams can be a little hidden.
[4844.28 → 4844.84] They can be a little tough.
[4844.84 → 4847.06] There's also a very obvious hinge on one side.
[4848.88 → 4849.84] I'm just saying,
[4850.22 → 4851.38] I get it.
[4851.90 → 4852.84] I get it.
[4853.12 → 4853.52] But,
[4853.64 → 4854.06] um,
[4854.46 → 4855.42] it was a little hard.
[4855.66 → 4855.90] Yeah.
[4856.00 → 4857.12] It was a little hard to witness.
[4857.54 → 4858.50] I do think,
[4858.50 → 4858.74] and,
[4858.78 → 4859.26] and I,
[4859.26 → 4861.40] I noticed today actually after we talked,
[4861.46 → 4862.42] I swear I didn't steal it,
[4862.48 → 4864.22] but I noticed one of the top comments,
[4864.98 → 4865.60] um,
[4865.60 → 4869.18] the second comment from Daniel Owen Tech,
[4869.36 → 4870.10] Daniel Owen Tech.
[4870.22 → 4870.42] Okay,
[4870.48 → 4870.72] cool.
[4871.04 → 4871.42] Um,
[4871.42 → 4873.16] is now check if they can use Windows 11.
[4874.56 → 4878.78] Most of my high school students have no idea how to do anything on a PC that isn't in a browser.
[4879.12 → 4880.40] And watching the video,
[4880.52 → 4882.10] I was actually surprised.
[4882.20 → 4885.60] I think my rose-tinted glasses were like cracked or something.
[4885.66 → 4887.60] I thought it was going to be harder for them to do these things.
[4887.60 → 4890.56] I forgot how much it would prompt you with like,
[4890.64 → 4891.28] oh,
[4891.30 → 4892.04] you tried to do something.
[4892.14 → 4893.14] What do you want to do with these things?
[4893.42 → 4893.54] Yeah.
[4893.62 → 4894.50] You inserted a thing.
[4894.58 → 4895.30] Here's all your options.
[4895.40 → 4898.12] I forgot how much that Windows XP was pretty sick.
[4898.32 → 4898.50] Yeah.
[4898.64 → 4898.86] Yeah.
[4898.90 → 4899.24] It was,
[4899.36 → 4901.40] it was definitely a turn.
[4901.40 → 4903.58] I was looking back at it more positively since watching.
[4903.58 → 4905.80] It was a turning point for Windows for sure.
[4905.88 → 4906.92] Cause 98 was,
[4907.18 → 4910.12] it was simple,
[4910.44 → 4912.48] but you couldn't do that much.
[4912.78 → 4913.04] Yeah.
[4913.04 → 4915.04] Like 98 was really easy to use.
[4915.10 → 4919.80] I was not stoked on the move to XP and how like overcomplicated the start menu was now and stuff.
[4919.88 → 4921.96] Like what is all this other crap?
[4922.02 → 4923.08] I just need my programs.
[4923.08 → 4923.48] Like what,
[4923.56 → 4923.80] what,
[4923.92 → 4924.50] you know,
[4924.54 → 4924.72] like,
[4924.84 → 4928.74] and obviously my recollection of this is pretty spotty,
[4928.78 → 4931.34] given that that was a hot minute ago when I was quite young.
[4931.34 → 4931.72] But,
[4931.78 → 4932.22] um,
[4932.22 → 4932.38] I,
[4932.46 → 4935.62] I remember not having a problem using 98 SE.
[4936.16 → 4936.56] Um,
[4936.56 → 4938.24] and then XP was like,
[4939.18 → 4940.58] the only reason that I got,
[4940.64 → 4944.96] kind of got good at using it was because I was at a stage in my life where it was fun to just like,
[4945.00 → 4945.20] you know,
[4945.26 → 4948.48] explore and spend the ample free time that I had.
[4948.48 → 4949.48] Because I didn't have a job,
[4949.56 → 4949.82] you know,
[4949.82 → 4950.60] playing around with it.
[4950.62 → 4951.84] It just was fun that way.
[4951.86 → 4952.22] It was,
[4952.24 → 4952.84] it was fun.
[4953.08 → 4953.44] It was fun.
[4953.46 → 4955.22] I think it actually was just fun.
[4956.02 → 4957.32] I think it didn't get in your way.
[4957.84 → 4958.24] Um,
[4958.24 → 4961.76] I think it had a lot of ease of use that modern operating systems have,
[4961.82 → 4961.98] you know,
[4962.02 → 4963.96] maybe not as much as the most modern ones,
[4963.98 → 4966.02] but it had a lot of ease of use built in.
[4966.12 → 4968.98] It wouldn't get in your way, and you could do a lot with it.
[4968.98 → 4970.28] It was very cool that way.
[4971.46 → 4972.56] You know what else is cool?
[4973.46 → 4973.86] Uh,
[4973.88 → 4975.00] we should do a couple more announcements.
[4975.34 → 4975.66] Yes.
[4975.90 → 4977.38] I want to see the shirt.
[4977.38 → 4983.04] A lot of people have been requesting a smaller version of the LTT backpack.
[4983.34 → 4984.58] here it is.
[4985.44 → 4987.24] The commuter pack.
[4987.98 → 4990.72] A backpack built to support your day.
[4991.04 → 4991.92] Every day,
[4992.66 → 4996.96] your day organized pockets for all your tech and essentials ready for you to
[4996.96 → 4998.00] access in seconds.
[4998.22 → 5003.76] No more rummaging our most portable backpack yet with a 20 litter capacity
[5003.76 → 5007.36] built to last with durable water-resistant reprieve.
[5007.38 → 5007.80] canvas,
[5008.10 → 5009.52] a rivet reinforced top handle,
[5009.82 → 5010.54] PKK zippers,
[5010.94 → 5016.38] and a certified validated dual layer bottom.
[5017.38 → 5018.44] I didn't know you did.
[5018.54 → 5019.24] That's hilarious.
[5019.96 → 5021.66] Product is still in final development.
[5021.88 → 5023.42] Final specifications may change.
[5023.44 → 5024.18] Oh my gosh.
[5024.72 → 5025.02] Uh,
[5025.02 → 5030.96] but you can sign up for it at ltdstore.com slash pages slash commuter dash sign up.
[5030.96 → 5033.12] And I am really excited about this thing.
[5034.12 → 5034.72] Are you,
[5034.78 → 5035.92] are you going to cut into it?
[5036.20 → 5036.54] No,
[5036.68 → 5037.50] I'm not.
[5037.60 → 5038.32] It's not necessary.
[5038.68 → 5039.00] We already did that.
[5039.06 → 5039.78] We already did that.
[5039.94 → 5040.34] Um,
[5040.66 → 5041.78] this is it.
[5042.20 → 5043.32] It can hold,
[5043.44 → 5044.32] love this pocket.
[5044.32 → 5051.20] It can hold a shocking amount of stuff considering how much smaller it is than the OG backpack.
[5051.58 → 5056.18] We have external water bottle holders on both sides.
[5056.18 → 5057.42] So it,
[5057.50 → 5057.72] that's,
[5057.78 → 5061.86] it was more of an ergonomic choice than thinking that anyone needs to carry two water bottles.
[5062.42 → 5063.24] Some people do.
[5063.62 → 5064.04] Sure.
[5064.30 → 5065.68] But it was more to do with,
[5065.82 → 5068.92] depending on which way you like to swing your bag off to grab your water bottle.
[5069.10 → 5071.08] We wanted to have the option on both sides.
[5071.08 → 5071.60] Uh,
[5071.60 → 5073.78] but I use this side for my,
[5073.78 → 5074.14] eh,
[5075.46 → 5077.18] precision screwdriver kit.
[5077.58 → 5078.98] And also get this.
[5079.10 → 5080.24] So you can see the
[5080.28 → 5080.50] eh,
[5080.86 → 5081.58] the bag there.
[5081.72 → 5081.90] Yeah.
[5081.98 → 5082.80] Let's see the pocket there.
[5083.02 → 5083.20] Ah,
[5083.34 → 5083.62] ah,
[5084.62 → 5086.10] there's a little hidden zipper here.
[5086.12 → 5086.48] What?
[5086.58 → 5087.24] I didn't know about that.
[5087.24 → 5088.12] I keep my mouse in there.
[5089.26 → 5089.52] Okay.
[5089.62 → 5090.00] Pretty cool,
[5090.06 → 5090.24] right?
[5090.44 → 5090.80] Ah,
[5090.94 → 5091.32] ah.
[5091.46 → 5093.46] I didn't expect the hidden pocket to be that big.
[5093.52 → 5094.82] I didn't expect you to pull a mouse out.
[5096.22 → 5096.62] Um,
[5096.96 → 5097.32] ah,
[5098.36 → 5098.82] oh man.
[5099.00 → 5099.12] It,
[5099.16 → 5099.54] it is like,
[5099.70 → 5099.94] yeah,
[5099.94 → 5101.52] you have to need it secondhand cause it,
[5101.56 → 5101.74] it,
[5101.74 → 5103.64] it wants to be more streamlined.
[5103.64 → 5104.98] So it tries to close a little bit.
[5105.14 → 5105.54] Like the OG,
[5105.72 → 5108.50] we have our RFID protected passport pocket back here.
[5108.92 → 5110.12] I believe,
[5110.56 → 5110.80] oh no,
[5110.86 → 5112.52] it was going to be accessible from both sides.
[5112.60 → 5113.08] I killed that.
[5113.74 → 5114.18] Um,
[5114.18 → 5115.32] because I didn't think it was necessary.
[5115.74 → 5116.02] Uh,
[5116.02 → 5118.14] it's got a sunglass pocket.
[5118.70 → 5121.52] I have a ton of stuff in mine right now.
[5121.64 → 5122.70] Sunglass pocket in there.
[5122.80 → 5126.56] It does not include a fancy dangle thing made by Linus's children.
[5126.72 → 5127.18] Oh yeah,
[5127.28 → 5127.48] no,
[5127.52 → 5128.00] that's a
[5128.06 → 5129.14] that's not part of the bag.
[5129.32 → 5129.50] Yeah.
[5129.50 → 5133.60] And then it's got kind of a pocket of holding just like the OG one.
[5134.98 → 5138.06] So I've got a bulky sweater in there.
[5138.40 → 5142.68] I've got a tech sack in there to help with organization.
[5143.20 → 5144.26] That's about it.
[5144.26 → 5146.34] Because it is a significantly smaller bag.
[5146.42 → 5147.04] So that sweater,
[5147.20 → 5148.70] you have organized your pockets after that.
[5148.78 → 5149.62] Took up the whole thing.
[5149.62 → 5151.80] And then in here,
[5151.80 → 5152.52] we've just got,
[5152.60 → 5152.74] you know,
[5152.80 → 5154.36] kind of variety of pockets,
[5154.46 → 5155.68] including one for the screwdriver.
[5155.68 → 5158.18] I've got a little magnetic thing on here to kind of,
[5158.18 → 5158.94] you know,
[5159.00 → 5160.80] keep them from getting all flappy doodle.
[5160.80 → 5163.22] And then just like the original bag,
[5163.22 → 5164.34] it's tech first,
[5164.34 → 5164.66] right?
[5165.60 → 5169.12] So these go all the way down,
[5169.18 → 5173.40] which they didn't in the initial revision because of the interference with the water bottle pocket,
[5173.48 → 5175.56] but we found a new way to construct it so that they can.
[5175.56 → 5177.06] And we've got one,
[5177.60 → 5178.46] two sleeves.
[5178.46 → 5182.50] So you can have liked your laptop and your tablet or your big laptop and your smaller laptop.
[5182.82 → 5188.32] And then we've also got a space on this side for your one or two chargers.
[5189.04 → 5190.34] And then a mouse or something.
[5190.46 → 5190.60] Yeah.
[5190.66 → 5192.52] Or a charger and a mouse or something like that.
[5192.78 → 5193.44] And then we've got,
[5193.56 → 5194.90] this cannot get the angle right on this.
[5194.96 → 5196.50] We've got a black zipper pocket right here.
[5196.56 → 5197.28] So you can,
[5197.48 → 5197.68] you know,
[5197.68 → 5198.22] put some,
[5198.22 → 5201.00] some low profile things down there as well.
[5201.06 → 5202.42] The ergonomics are perfect.
[5202.84 → 5204.46] I would say it is as good,
[5204.46 → 5205.36] if not better.
[5205.56 → 5206.74] than the original one,
[5206.84 → 5208.32] especially if you have a smaller frame,
[5208.44 → 5209.88] like your body,
[5210.12 → 5210.88] the frame of your body.
[5214.16 → 5216.62] And it's going to be,
[5216.70 → 5217.54] have we announced pricing?
[5218.56 → 5219.10] I don't know.
[5220.98 → 5222.32] Given that the team hasn't,
[5222.40 → 5223.20] I'm not going to say it.
[5223.36 → 5225.34] It's not in the blurb that we have.
[5225.34 → 5228.12] And I don't see it on the site right now.
[5228.12 → 5228.24] Oh,
[5228.24 → 5228.60] personally.
[5228.70 → 5229.48] Was there a blurb?
[5229.60 → 5229.86] Sorry.
[5229.94 → 5231.70] Did I hit all the points in the blurb?
[5231.72 → 5232.36] I don't know.
[5232.44 → 5232.62] Neat.
[5232.72 → 5232.92] Well,
[5233.04 → 5233.40] anyway,
[5233.82 → 5235.02] cool.
[5235.18 → 5235.50] Not yet.
[5235.56 → 5236.76] The official answer is not yet.
[5236.96 → 5238.32] The official answer is not yet.
[5238.42 → 5238.68] Okay.
[5238.74 → 5239.00] Well,
[5239.68 → 5241.24] it's going to have a price.
[5241.98 → 5242.46] It will.
[5243.10 → 5243.46] Yes,
[5243.74 → 5244.64] it will have that.
[5244.94 → 5246.88] LEG.GG slash commuter.
[5247.04 → 5247.22] Dan,
[5247.26 → 5248.38] do you mind throwing that in all the chats?
[5248.82 → 5249.00] Yep.
[5249.26 → 5249.66] All right.
[5250.62 → 5251.00] Okay,
[5251.10 → 5251.36] fine.
[5251.52 → 5252.16] Do you want to talk?
[5252.16 → 5253.06] We get to see it.
[5253.06 → 5253.98] Yay.
[5253.98 → 5254.94] All right.
[5255.58 → 5255.90] Our,
[5255.90 → 5257.22] we just did that.
[5257.32 → 5258.42] Really darting all over the place.
[5258.42 → 5260.42] I'm trying to copy the link.
[5260.50 → 5260.62] Yeah.
[5260.70 → 5261.34] I mean,
[5261.34 → 5262.92] it's not like it was 12 characters.
[5263.12 → 5263.24] You can,
[5263.48 → 5263.50] you need.
[5263.66 → 5265.36] Oh my goodness.
[5265.80 → 5266.28] Okay.
[5266.28 → 5268.56] This one's for all the floaters out there.
[5268.96 → 5269.48] Yesterday,
[5269.90 → 5272.38] Sarah went live on float plane,
[5272.60 → 5276.96] designing a shirt with suggestions from our float plane subscribers.
[5277.30 → 5278.16] The result,
[5278.52 → 5280.86] a design that Luke has not yet seen.
[5280.94 → 5281.04] No,
[5281.08 → 5281.98] I was busy working.
[5282.10 → 5283.00] I didn't get to see it at all.
[5283.04 → 5284.44] And I have also actually not seen.
[5284.60 → 5284.82] Oh,
[5285.66 → 5285.86] cool.
[5285.92 → 5286.40] So it's a
[5286.54 → 5287.48] as far as my understanding goes,
[5287.50 → 5288.76] it's a bit of design by committee.
[5288.76 → 5290.64] So there was input from the audience,
[5290.76 → 5299.18] but she did the actual design work, and you have to be a float plane subscriber and then log in with your float plane account on the store to be able to buy it.
[5299.58 → 5299.74] Oh,
[5299.84 → 5300.18] okay.
[5300.92 → 5301.50] So Dan,
[5301.54 → 5303.10] if you want to copy this one as well.
[5303.42 → 5304.06] Uh,
[5304.10 → 5304.40] okay.
[5304.62 → 5304.86] I,
[5305.30 → 5306.36] that's so sick.
[5306.36 → 5308.14] what am I looking at?
[5308.16 → 5310.34] It's a float plane with a little Dino hanging off it.
[5310.42 → 5314.04] I think that's actually so cute.
[5315.44 → 5315.84] Wait,
[5315.86 → 5316.74] is it on the back?
[5316.82 → 5317.44] Do you want to zoom in?
[5317.66 → 5318.00] Yeah.
[5319.24 → 5319.64] Oh,
[5319.76 → 5320.24] okay.
[5320.68 → 5321.78] That is adorable.
[5324.96 → 5325.32] Actually,
[5325.40 → 5325.62] you're like,
[5325.76 → 5326.46] the wings' bro.
[5326.52 → 5326.68] Oh,
[5326.72 → 5328.44] he probably chewed the wing off on this side.
[5328.48 → 5329.32] Oh my goodness.
[5329.42 → 5330.16] That's my assumption.
[5330.82 → 5331.30] Hold on.
[5331.30 → 5332.54] Someone says they see bread.
[5333.00 → 5333.36] Bread.
[5333.84 → 5334.92] I don't see any bread.
[5335.08 → 5336.04] I don't see any bread.
[5336.36 → 5336.56] Did,
[5336.72 → 5338.06] did she hide bread in it?
[5338.40 → 5339.28] Is there hidden bread,
[5339.42 → 5339.56] Dan?
[5339.98 → 5340.54] No way.
[5340.62 → 5341.14] I don't know.
[5341.26 → 5342.54] I was doing my job.
[5342.70 → 5343.32] Bread plane.
[5343.50 → 5344.72] What are you guys even talking about?
[5344.80 → 5345.14] I think,
[5345.24 → 5345.52] no,
[5345.98 → 5347.28] is it made of bread?
[5347.36 → 5348.86] Is that why there's a bite out of it?
[5349.56 → 5350.40] Baguette wing?
[5351.24 → 5351.54] Baguette wing.
[5351.54 → 5351.98] Is it?
[5352.24 → 5352.52] Oh,
[5352.58 → 5353.26] because he ate it?
[5353.26 → 5353.54] No,
[5353.60 → 5354.94] I think the little,
[5354.94 → 5355.78] the little marks,
[5355.96 → 5356.68] like a baguette.
[5356.88 → 5357.34] Is that,
[5357.42 → 5357.78] is that,
[5357.88 → 5358.56] is that intentional?
[5358.86 → 5360.86] That is probably a stretch.
[5361.10 → 5361.32] Yeah.
[5361.40 → 5361.62] Yeah.
[5361.74 → 5362.14] Guys,
[5362.18 → 5363.02] I don't know about that.
[5363.10 → 5363.82] What little marks?
[5363.94 → 5364.30] Yeah.
[5364.36 → 5365.16] Those little marks there.
[5365.30 → 5367.04] They kind of look like baguette marks.
[5367.22 → 5367.46] No,
[5367.58 → 5368.22] I don't think so.
[5368.22 → 5368.84] I don't think so.
[5368.84 → 5369.48] I don't think so,
[5369.48 → 5369.54] you guys.
[5369.54 → 5370.28] That is such a reach.
[5370.44 → 5370.84] That is,
[5370.94 → 5372.02] that is a reach indeed.
[5373.88 → 5375.30] The planes landing,
[5376.06 → 5377.82] like the pontoons were supposed,
[5377.96 → 5379.16] supported to be bread.
[5379.28 → 5380.36] I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[5380.42 → 5380.62] Anyway,
[5380.98 → 5382.22] this is fan fiction now.
[5382.32 → 5382.54] Thanks,
[5382.64 → 5383.04] Float plane.
[5384.08 → 5385.94] Enjoy your exclusive t-shirt.
[5386.10 → 5388.40] It is only available to Float plane subscribers.
[5388.70 → 5390.20] So if you all want to leave a merch message,
[5390.30 → 5391.02] this is your chance.
[5391.14 → 5391.78] LEG.GG
[5391.78 → 5393.58] slash FP Merch 10.
[5393.68 → 5393.80] Well,
[5393.84 → 5393.96] yeah,
[5393.96 → 5394.74] we sold out of them.
[5394.94 → 5395.30] Yeah,
[5395.32 → 5396.32] we don't get to wear them.
[5396.80 → 5397.18] Sorry,
[5397.26 → 5397.40] Luke.
[5398.22 → 5401.26] I guess I'll have to have some shirts that aren't tells.
[5401.50 → 5402.50] All right.
[5403.32 → 5403.70] Okay.
[5403.94 → 5404.20] Sorry,
[5404.28 → 5404.48] Luke.
[5404.62 → 5405.02] Okay.
[5405.34 → 5405.66] Yeah.
[5405.80 → 5406.90] They're so nice,
[5407.02 → 5407.22] dude.
[5408.22 → 5409.46] Oh my God.
[5410.66 → 5412.32] Every day that I don't have a clean one,
[5412.34 → 5414.14] or I'm like too lazy to do the laundry again,
[5414.26 → 5414.82] because like the
[5414.82 → 5415.68] the t-shirt one,
[5415.74 → 5416.82] the non-long-sleeve one,
[5416.86 → 5417.38] it's probably,
[5417.66 → 5419.04] I had it for like two weeks.
[5419.24 → 5420.34] It's probably gone through the laundry,
[5420.48 → 5421.00] no joke,
[5421.06 → 5421.96] like 10 times.
[5426.34 → 5427.36] And then I went to,
[5427.36 → 5428.74] I did my thing where like,
[5428.80 → 5429.02] you know,
[5429.08 → 5432.10] I try to let the audience buy stuff before I request it.
[5432.52 → 5433.32] They're gone.
[5434.38 → 5434.78] Yeah.
[5436.02 → 5436.38] Sorry.
[5436.98 → 5437.34] Okay.
[5438.28 → 5439.28] We didn't order that many.
[5439.30 → 5440.72] There are some long sleeves left,
[5440.80 → 5441.56] but the short sleeves,
[5441.70 → 5442.70] they only have short.
[5443.14 → 5443.44] Medium,
[5443.64 → 5443.98] large,
[5444.14 → 5444.62] extra large,
[5444.74 → 5444.92] extra,
[5444.98 → 5445.44] extra large,
[5445.52 → 5446.64] and triple extra large.
[5446.64 → 5447.12] You mean small.
[5447.32 → 5447.76] Are all gone.
[5447.82 → 5448.12] Not short.
[5448.38 → 5448.54] Oh,
[5448.72 → 5448.90] right.
[5449.00 → 5449.22] Yeah.
[5449.34 → 5449.66] All good.
[5450.16 → 5450.32] Yeah.
[5450.32 → 5450.62] My bad.
[5451.82 → 5452.88] Specifically not short,
[5452.98 → 5453.32] actually.
[5453.88 → 5454.06] Yep.
[5454.76 → 5455.52] Sorry about that.
[5456.32 → 5457.30] I'll get them someday.
[5457.98 → 5458.36] Okay.
[5458.40 → 5459.58] The last announcement is,
[5459.76 → 5463.88] do you still need your original LTT backpack carabiners replaced?
[5464.20 → 5465.94] We have contacted all the backpack buyers,
[5466.12 → 5466.62] we think,
[5466.62 → 5469.46] but we want to call out our form one last time.
[5469.52 → 5470.96] If in case there's anyone who missed it,
[5471.24 → 5475.86] all you need is your order number and just go to leg.GG slash carabiner form to request it.
[5476.02 → 5477.20] It'll be closing soon.
[5477.20 → 5479.30] But if you miss the deadline for the form,
[5480.22 → 5480.62] yeah,
[5480.68 → 5480.98] trust me,
[5481.00 → 5481.12] bro,
[5481.16 → 5481.88] we still got you.
[5481.94 → 5482.74] You can message support.
[5483.20 → 5483.36] Uh,
[5483.36 → 5484.52] we know this took a long time.
[5484.60 → 5485.30] We've learned a lot.
[5485.72 → 5486.12] Um,
[5486.94 → 5489.04] but whether you own a backpack or not,
[5489.08 → 5492.82] we hope you feel that we've honoured our commitment to do right by our customers.
[5493.32 → 5496.60] And we have finally delivered carabiner replacements to everybody.
[5496.62 → 5499.52] with an LTT backpack.
[5499.86 → 5501.24] Speaking of things that aren't right.
[5501.88 → 5502.64] Oh no,
[5502.78 → 5506.08] this dog specific chatbot,
[5506.20 → 5510.38] an AI powered pet collar called the Shazam band.
[5511.60 → 5513.12] I wonder if they're going to get sued.
[5513.30 → 5513.56] Uh,
[5513.56 → 5519.70] uses sensors and speakers to allow your pet to talk to you out loud in a human like voice.
[5519.88 → 5523.72] The collar comes with 30 different voices with associated personas,
[5523.72 → 5526.86] such as Southern bell and mafia boss.
[5527.94 → 5528.46] Cool.
[5529.08 → 5530.72] It's actually doing sound kind of cool.
[5530.72 → 5535.82] How much insight the Shazam band actually has into the emotions or thoughts of the animal wearing it.
[5536.10 → 5536.88] Spoiler alert.
[5537.30 → 5537.58] Uh,
[5538.98 → 5540.60] the big old guests,
[5540.80 → 5541.30] but zero.
[5541.84 → 5542.36] Um,
[5542.72 → 5543.44] yeah.
[5543.70 → 5544.74] Judging by its demo,
[5544.92 → 5548.32] the device appears to use some amount of situational cues,
[5548.46 → 5553.86] such as what the animal is currently doing or the behaviour of nearby human beings to inform its responses.
[5553.86 → 5554.32] Oh good.
[5554.40 → 5555.86] So it's spying on us real good then.
[5556.02 → 5556.20] Yeah.
[5556.30 → 5556.82] It's all.
[5557.00 → 5558.08] Every part of this is perfect.
[5558.40 → 5562.30] The collar optionally includes GPS tracking and text notifications.
[5562.30 → 5568.76] In case the animal gets lost or winds up in danger or starts following random strangers around talking to them,
[5569.10 → 5569.34] uh,
[5569.34 → 5570.40] which would be crazy.
[5570.40 → 5572.60] The base version costs $495.
[5572.60 → 5573.08] What?
[5573.48 → 5574.84] Are you kidding me?
[5575.04 → 5578.48] The enhanced version costs for a Bluetooth speaker with junk AI attached to it.
[5578.48 → 5579.12] Are you kidding me?
[5579.12 → 5579.94] The enhanced version,
[5580.02 → 5581.12] it probably needs a subscription too.
[5581.20 → 5581.48] I don't know.
[5581.76 → 5582.06] Uh,
[5582.06 → 5585.48] the enhanced version costs $595 and there is,
[5585.58 → 5585.84] yes,
[5585.92 → 5592.44] there's optional subscription fees that cost 200 to $300 annually after the first year.
[5594.02 → 5601.60] So do you want to have an entirely fake relationship with something that you only have in order to have a real relationship with it?
[5604.28 → 5605.36] Wouldn't that be cool?
[5606.04 → 5606.52] Wow.
[5606.52 → 5612.98] Do you want to be actually completely not in tune with what your dog is thinking or just feeling at all?
[5613.14 → 5613.58] Imagine.
[5613.98 → 5614.22] Yeah.
[5614.38 → 5614.72] You know,
[5614.80 → 5616.34] there's been a bunch of this type of stuff.
[5616.34 → 5624.60] Like there's been this trend where people try to use ChatGPT to like talk to their future selves, and they're getting like really emotional over it.
[5624.66 → 5625.08] And I'm like,
[5625.14 → 5626.46] that's not you.
[5629.16 → 5630.76] That's not you at all.
[5631.00 → 5632.70] You're talking to a robot.
[5633.96 → 5634.92] Please stop.
[5634.92 → 5638.08] Oh my goodness.
[5638.88 → 5639.32] Anyway.
[5640.32 → 5641.28] Citizen Bean says,
[5641.38 → 5641.74] personally,
[5641.84 → 5642.90] I use dog psychics.
[5643.14 → 5644.60] This may be a product for Dennis.
[5646.38 → 5650.76] Some people do actually go to psychics to tell them what their animal is thinking.
[5651.20 → 5651.48] Yes.
[5651.72 → 5653.86] This would be cheaper than that in the long run.
[5653.86 → 5655.74] Just as effective.
[5655.84 → 5656.82] And probably just as accurate.
[5657.78 → 5658.18] Actually,
[5658.32 → 5661.98] probably not even because if you actually know anything about animals at all,
[5661.98 → 5664.84] you can probably tell something of like what its attitude is.
[5664.84 → 5665.78] I guess you would bring it.
[5665.96 → 5666.10] Yeah.
[5666.22 → 5666.40] Yeah.
[5666.60 → 5666.82] That makes sense.
[5666.94 → 5667.08] Yeah.
[5667.22 → 5667.40] Yeah.
[5668.24 → 5669.32] Might I make a suggestion?
[5669.32 → 5671.56] The dog psychic has high animal handling skills.
[5671.56 → 5672.22] Where's the psychic?
[5673.02 → 5673.36] If you,
[5673.48 → 5674.52] I mean,
[5674.54 → 5676.72] it would have to be for the psychic to form a link with it.
[5676.72 → 5677.74] Where was the hyphen?
[5678.10 → 5678.32] Oh.
[5679.02 → 5680.16] Can I make a suggestion?
[5680.66 → 5682.88] If you have $600 to burn,
[5683.90 → 5684.16] Hey!
[5684.98 → 5686.68] There's always the Luxe backpack.
[5687.04 → 5688.28] It won't talk to you,
[5688.34 → 5688.78] unfortunately.
[5688.90 → 5690.94] It has no AI whatsoever,
[5690.94 → 5694.08] but there is one review for it
[5694.08 → 5696.04] and Buddy is stoked.
[5696.50 → 5696.90] So,
[5697.12 → 5698.08] there you go.
[5702.70 → 5705.38] It's got a whale on it.
[5705.50 → 5705.74] Okay?
[5706.04 → 5706.18] Oh,
[5706.22 → 5706.60] that's kind of,
[5706.66 → 5707.72] I just really didn't know that.
[5707.78 → 5708.42] That's kind of sick.
[5709.18 → 5713.80] I love that so many products in the store just have so many reviews.
[5714.70 → 5716.84] Like the screwdriver and the water bottles and stuff
[5716.84 → 5718.84] have an insane amount of reviews.
[5718.84 → 5721.90] And then that backpack just has one.
[5723.56 → 5725.58] We only just started shipping them recently.
[5725.80 → 5726.08] Oh,
[5726.18 → 5728.12] we've been taking orders for like a year,
[5728.22 → 5729.60] but it took a long time to get it done
[5729.60 → 5731.70] because of all the issues with our backpack supplier.
[5732.30 → 5734.54] The screwdriver has over 8,000 reviews.
[5734.84 → 5735.62] In all seriousness,
[5735.82 → 5736.40] the Luxe backpack,
[5736.54 → 5738.66] I think we have like three left in stock
[5738.66 → 5741.84] because we overordered compared to what people pre-ordered,
[5742.00 → 5743.36] but not by that much.
[5743.70 → 5745.76] And then it took a lot longer for us to get them
[5745.76 → 5747.50] and we kept taking orders.
[5747.50 → 5749.24] So by the time they actually arrived,
[5749.32 → 5751.20] I think we only had like 10 extra.
[5751.76 → 5753.10] So if you want one,
[5753.38 → 5756.02] actually do order it right this second.
[5757.22 → 5758.44] If you don't want one,
[5758.54 → 5760.40] then I don't know if we're ever going to make one again.
[5760.74 → 5763.40] So yeah.
[5764.12 → 5764.62] Cool.
[5764.82 → 5765.28] Good chat.
[5766.04 → 5766.36] This,
[5766.44 → 5768.94] this guy makes a $600 backpack,
[5768.94 → 5770.74] but won't build Linus town.
[5771.06 → 5771.76] I know,
[5771.80 → 5772.04] right?
[5772.44 → 5772.64] Well,
[5772.72 → 5775.90] maybe if people bought more $600 backpacks,
[5775.90 → 5777.14] I'd be able to,
[5777.22 → 5779.36] did you ever think of that Luke?
[5779.50 → 5782.96] That's where you have to store your ID card is in your $600 backpack.
[5783.24 → 5783.64] I mean,
[5783.64 → 5785.22] it makes perfect sense to me.
[5785.30 → 5786.80] You get randomly ID'd on the street.
[5786.94 → 5788.98] Someone asked how many Luxe backpacks we sold.
[5789.24 → 5793.10] And this seems like the kind of Intel that would be really stupid to like,
[5793.44 → 5794.28] talk about publicly,
[5794.42 → 5795.10] but I'm curious.
[5795.26 → 5797.38] So I'm going to look, and then I'll decide after I see it,
[5797.40 → 5798.48] if I'm going to disclose it.
[5798.72 → 5798.92] Nice.
[5798.92 → 5799.36] Uh,
[5799.72 → 5800.00] in,
[5800.12 → 5800.66] in other news,
[5800.70 → 5802.18] I'll do a topic while you're looking that up.
[5802.42 → 5802.60] Uh,
[5802.60 → 5807.02] the FCC makes cancelling easy because Lena Khan is a boss.
[5807.18 → 5807.36] Okay.
[5807.36 → 5809.04] This is actually the coolest thing ever.
[5809.04 → 5809.64] And I love it.
[5809.64 → 5811.14] And every country needs to do this.
[5811.14 → 5812.26] And I don't say that often.
[5812.36 → 5814.16] A lot of stuff she's doing is sick.
[5814.48 → 5814.70] Uh,
[5814.70 → 5818.12] the FCC has released a final version of its new click to cancel rule,
[5818.12 → 5822.44] which requires companies that offer subscription services to provide methods of unsubscribing
[5822.44 → 5826.72] that are at least as convenient and easy as their sign-up method.
[5826.72 → 5832.68] A service you signed up for with an app needs to allow you to cancel via app or online.
[5832.68 → 5837.82] A gym you signed up for in person needs to allow you to cancel by calling or online.
[5837.98 → 5840.86] The new rule will take effect in around six months.
[5841.72 → 5842.94] Very cool.
[5843.80 → 5844.56] Very cool.
[5845.10 → 5845.70] Very nice.
[5847.08 → 5847.64] Uh,
[5847.68 → 5848.42] discussion question is,
[5848.42 → 5853.34] can some subscription services even survive without leveraging the ADHD tax?
[5854.06 → 5854.50] Uh,
[5855.46 → 5856.82] this will hurt some of them for sure.
[5857.04 → 5857.30] If,
[5857.38 → 5858.54] if for no other reason,
[5858.54 → 5861.12] then because this law comes in,
[5861.12 → 5863.00] I think people will pay a little bit more attention.
[5863.62 → 5864.06] They'll go like,
[5864.20 → 5864.38] Oh,
[5864.42 → 5867.44] I wonder what things I'm subscribed to now that it's easy to unsubscribe and then go.
[5867.84 → 5868.68] We can help.
[5868.96 → 5869.12] Yeah.
[5869.66 → 5870.26] Oh yeah.
[5870.30 → 5871.00] How is the
[5871.10 → 5871.44] uh,
[5871.50 → 5872.10] how is the
[5872.10 → 5873.82] the Twitter block function change?
[5873.82 → 5874.48] Not in the doc.
[5874.52 → 5876.12] I totally slept on that this week.
[5876.12 → 5881.30] I even went through and was looking for stuff to add, and I just totally forgot about it.
[5881.66 → 5882.06] I don't know.
[5882.16 → 5882.28] I,
[5882.66 → 5885.10] basically people you blocked can see your stuff now.
[5885.14 → 5886.02] They just can't interact with you.
[5886.06 → 5886.46] Is that right?
[5886.56 → 5888.16] The funny thing about that to me though,
[5888.22 → 5888.84] I don't know what it is.
[5888.96 → 5889.54] This is where,
[5889.68 → 5892.08] this is where I'm a little confused about it is,
[5892.22 → 5892.54] um,
[5892.80 → 5893.12] I,
[5893.38 → 5894.10] I,
[5894.26 → 5895.92] I don't understand what difference it makes.
[5896.04 → 5897.52] It doesn't make a difference at all.
[5897.60 → 5899.34] Because block was not,
[5899.34 → 5900.16] um,
[5900.30 → 5901.38] like protected tweets.
[5901.38 → 5902.12] It was just,
[5902.12 → 5904.04] they can make another account.
[5904.04 → 5904.56] Yeah.
[5904.70 → 5905.06] You could,
[5905.18 → 5905.54] you could,
[5905.54 → 5909.24] you could have another browser tab that's logged into a different one or,
[5909.28 → 5911.30] or isn't logged in, and then you could see it there.
[5911.30 → 5911.68] So I,
[5911.84 → 5912.36] yeah,
[5912.40 → 5912.64] this,
[5912.76 → 5914.88] this being the straw is very confusing to me.
[5915.10 → 5915.56] Uh,
[5915.62 → 5918.30] the MCG said blue sky got over half a million users.
[5918.30 → 5918.62] Yeah.
[5918.86 → 5920.16] And I've seen a bunch of people.
[5921.00 → 5921.40] Okay.
[5921.64 → 5921.92] Bots.
[5922.94 → 5923.26] No,
[5923.34 → 5923.62] go ahead.
[5924.12 → 5924.44] Uh,
[5924.46 → 5924.66] no,
[5924.74 → 5925.02] I don't know.
[5925.10 → 5925.28] No,
[5925.36 → 5925.48] I,
[5925.54 → 5927.06] I don't think that's actually the issue.
[5927.06 → 5928.44] I don't think that's why people are,
[5928.44 → 5928.92] um,
[5928.92 → 5930.88] migrating to blue sky in droves right now.
[5930.94 → 5932.64] I think it's actually more to do with that.
[5932.72 → 5933.88] They updated their terms.
[5934.04 → 5937.50] So any art you post on X just belongs to them for AI training.
[5937.80 → 5939.32] How is that not a bigger story?
[5939.40 → 5939.84] I don't know.
[5942.80 → 5943.16] Okay.
[5944.04 → 5945.72] We're just used to it by this point.
[5945.86 → 5946.04] Yeah.
[5946.04 → 5947.48] So there's no opt out anymore.
[5947.70 → 5949.02] If you post something on there,
[5949.08 → 5951.68] it just like belongs to them to use.
[5951.76 → 5952.88] What if it's already on there?
[5953.00 → 5953.40] I don't know.
[5953.72 → 5954.80] That should be super illegal.
[5955.02 → 5955.26] Well,
[5955.26 → 5955.62] I mean,
[5955.62 → 5957.26] there are a lot of things that should be super illegal,
[5957.38 → 5957.96] but that's true.
[5958.38 → 5958.82] I don't know.
[5958.92 → 5959.12] Sure.
[5959.52 → 5959.66] Yeah.
[5959.78 → 5959.94] Yeah.
[5959.94 → 5960.48] Crystal D,
[5960.66 → 5961.18] uh,
[5961.18 → 5963.28] said it's not just that it's the AI crap.
[5963.36 → 5964.66] I hadn't heard of that at all.
[5964.74 → 5965.98] I had only heard of the
[5965.98 → 5966.84] the blocked thing.
[5967.00 → 5967.24] Yeah.
[5967.54 → 5969.40] The block thing honestly doesn't,
[5969.52 → 5969.60] it,
[5969.60 → 5973.80] that seems like kind of fundamentally not understanding how the block function worked.
[5973.80 → 5975.52] Like if you're sort of mad about this change,
[5975.54 → 5976.06] it just doesn't,
[5976.18 → 5977.88] I don't really understand how it makes a difference.
[5978.20 → 5979.42] Apparently Lux sold out.
[5980.20 → 5980.54] It did.
[5981.24 → 5981.48] Oh,
[5981.68 → 5981.92] balls.
[5982.14 → 5982.32] Uh,
[5982.34 → 5983.40] Tim said Lux sold out.
[5983.44 → 5985.78] I was going to order it as my Christmas gift to myself next month.
[5986.10 → 5986.38] Well,
[5986.56 → 5987.92] I'm thinking about that as well.
[5988.18 → 5988.62] You were?
[5989.02 → 5989.34] Yeah.
[5989.70 → 5991.02] Merry Christmas then,
[5991.02 → 5991.36] I guess.
[5991.50 → 5992.80] Seems like something you might do, actually.
[5994.04 → 5994.60] Might have,
[5994.92 → 5996.98] might have been for somebody else.
[5997.10 → 5997.46] I don't know.
[5997.68 → 5997.88] Oh,
[5997.96 → 5998.88] I haven't quite decided.
[5999.42 → 6001.32] That's why I've been dragging my feet on it for so long.
[6001.36 → 6002.20] It's a lot of money.
[6002.38 → 6003.84] It outsold Luke Newcomb.
[6004.62 → 6005.26] I think.
[6005.88 → 6006.20] Oh,
[6006.36 → 6007.26] let's see if I can find it.
[6007.36 → 6007.52] Yeah.
[6007.52 → 6007.96] We,
[6008.08 → 6008.50] uh,
[6008.62 → 6011.98] that was a weird decision that was done.
[6011.98 → 6013.52] I wear it like every weekend.
[6013.76 → 6014.56] So does Emma.
[6018.18 → 6018.54] I,
[6018.66 → 6019.42] I wore it.
[6020.22 → 6023.34] I don't think I've told you this story.
[6023.66 → 6024.06] Um,
[6024.12 → 6025.90] I wasn't planning on leaving the house one day.
[6026.82 → 6028.08] Emma's car was at the shop.
[6029.40 → 6030.72] Suddenly ready to be picked up.
[6030.90 → 6032.02] She needed me to go get it.
[6032.50 → 6033.32] I went to go get it.
[6033.36 → 6034.44] I didn't think about what I was wearing.
[6034.86 → 6036.36] I was wearing the Luke Newcomb shirt.
[6036.36 → 6040.08] I walk up, and it's this like random tire shop.
[6040.62 → 6041.02] Um,
[6041.36 → 6044.12] and there's one of the worker dudes just sitting outside on a tire,
[6044.24 → 6044.66] just chilling.
[6044.76 → 6045.54] And as I walk up,
[6045.56 → 6045.88] he's like,
[6045.96 → 6046.66] Luke Newcomb,
[6046.74 → 6046.94] eh?
[6046.94 → 6048.40] And I'm like,
[6048.46 → 6049.16] I looked out.
[6049.16 → 6049.68] And I'm just like,
[6049.74 → 6050.20] uh,
[6050.20 → 6052.54] yeah.
[6053.34 → 6053.96] I mean,
[6053.96 → 6056.08] even I don't wear shirts with my face on.
[6057.82 → 6058.22] Oh,
[6058.30 → 6059.30] it was so brutal.
[6059.30 → 6059.88] the name.
[6059.96 → 6060.18] Yes.
[6060.22 → 6061.16] But the face really?
[6062.78 → 6063.78] Gilmore D says,
[6063.88 → 6066.56] I'm wearing my Luke Newcomb shirt right now.
[6066.64 → 6067.08] Hell yeah.
[6067.60 → 6068.48] The thing was,
[6068.56 → 6071.42] they had a bunch of different colour options before they decided on one.
[6071.50 → 6073.82] So they gave me like the
[6073.90 → 6075.02] those basically.
[6075.02 → 6077.04] So I have like a bunch of this shirt.
[6077.04 → 6079.26] I can't wear any of them.
[6080.70 → 6081.18] Yeah.
[6081.28 → 6083.04] So Luke Newcomb sold.
[6084.10 → 6084.98] Let me see if I can find it.
[6085.00 → 6090.90] It was also like a reference from one random obscure WAN show that never came back.
[6091.16 → 6093.48] And then we sold shirts on it like weeks later.
[6094.06 → 6095.50] It made no sense.
[6095.82 → 6098.60] Sarah brought me over to see the draft of the design.
[6098.70 → 6099.14] She's like,
[6099.14 → 6100.92] I have no idea what you want,
[6101.02 → 6101.82] but is this it?
[6102.02 → 6102.44] I'm like,
[6102.52 → 6102.86] yeah.
[6105.86 → 6106.54] I mean,
[6106.68 → 6107.00] yeah.
[6107.40 → 6107.70] Uh,
[6107.70 → 6111.04] we sold 129 Luke Newcomb t-shirts.
[6111.56 → 6118.34] So you personally own probably like a solid 4% of the total Luke Newcomb stock of the world.
[6118.48 → 6119.52] We didn't sell those.
[6120.28 → 6120.56] I know.
[6120.68 → 6120.98] Okay.
[6121.16 → 6121.76] But I mean you,
[6121.90 → 6122.18] but you,
[6122.38 → 6122.90] yeah.
[6123.54 → 6124.02] Um,
[6124.28 → 6125.26] the second you said stock.
[6126.20 → 6128.92] So Luke Newcomb shirt was also,
[6128.92 → 6132.10] outsold by meme face sequin pillow clearance.
[6132.10 → 6133.34] That's actually sad.
[6133.56 → 6134.70] Outsold by,
[6134.70 → 6135.90] um,
[6136.20 → 6138.28] got fish pullovers.
[6139.18 → 6139.66] Um,
[6140.02 → 6141.78] outsold by red dad hats.
[6141.90 → 6142.10] You know,
[6142.16 → 6143.50] if I knew we were going to do it,
[6143.56 → 6146.48] I could have like kept the meme going for longer.
[6146.82 → 6148.74] Outsold by sweat band sets.
[6148.74 → 6153.92] I don't take fault for any of this.
[6154.20 → 6154.64] Um,
[6155.24 → 6157.40] all beanies crushed it.
[6158.04 → 6158.54] Uh,
[6158.54 → 6159.18] yeah.
[6160.48 → 6161.52] Even our,
[6161.72 → 6166.46] even our ABC book character plushes outsold the Luke Newcomb shirt.
[6166.70 → 6167.14] Unfortunately,
[6167.50 → 6168.02] I like that.
[6168.06 → 6169.64] I'm pretty sure I've actually bought some of those.
[6169.72 → 6169.84] Yeah.
[6169.90 → 6170.18] Those are,
[6170.20 → 6170.96] those are pretty nice.
[6171.12 → 6171.60] Um,
[6171.96 → 6172.28] okay.
[6172.36 → 6172.68] So for,
[6172.82 → 6173.70] if you guys are curious,
[6173.70 → 6174.18] uh,
[6174.18 → 6177.92] we ordered 240 Lux backpacks, and they are now sold out.
[6178.92 → 6179.36] Um,
[6179.36 → 6181.62] so not like a smash hit or anything,
[6181.62 → 6185.86] but when you compare the revenue number to other things that sold,
[6185.86 → 6186.20] you know,
[6186.24 → 6186.62] 200,
[6186.76 → 6187.80] 250 units,
[6187.80 → 6188.32] it's,
[6188.38 → 6189.84] it's pretty substantial.
[6190.58 → 6191.02] Um,
[6192.02 → 6192.26] yeah,
[6192.40 → 6194.00] it's like order 50 more.
[6194.00 → 6202.46] I don't even know that we'd be able to bring it back because the only reason we were able to do a production run of it was because we took pre-orders for it,
[6202.52 → 6207.24] which we kind of learned our lesson because some people toward the end were getting kind of irate about waiting so long for it,
[6207.24 → 6207.88] but you know how we are.
[6207.88 → 6209.54] We're not going to ship it until it's ready.
[6209.54 → 6209.74] Yeah.
[6210.04 → 6210.22] Yeah.
[6210.38 → 6210.78] Um,
[6210.78 → 6210.98] but,
[6211.10 → 6215.98] but the only reason we were able to commit to a production run of it was because we took pre-orders for it.
[6216.16 → 6216.98] And then,
[6216.98 → 6217.72] um,
[6217.98 → 6220.66] we would have to produce like enough to,
[6220.74 → 6222.10] to meet a minimum order quantity.
[6222.28 → 6224.12] We wouldn't want to take pre-orders for it again.
[6224.12 → 6224.60] So I don't,
[6224.64 → 6225.82] I don't know how we'd justify it.
[6225.94 → 6228.60] What is the rarest LMG merch item?
[6229.38 → 6230.28] The rarest?
[6230.40 → 6230.62] Yeah.
[6231.24 → 6234.70] I don't know if we could technically know because we sold stuff before.
[6235.76 → 6236.20] Um,
[6236.20 → 6237.84] there was that patch hoodie that you did,
[6237.92 → 6239.68] but that was not necessarily like,
[6240.30 → 6240.62] that was a
[6240.74 → 6240.84] yeah,
[6240.92 → 6241.26] I mean,
[6241.36 → 6243.72] that was a one in like fluke kind of chance,
[6243.80 → 6243.92] right?
[6243.94 → 6244.14] Yeah.
[6244.14 → 6244.40] The
[6244.48 → 6246.70] the ones that like had rare patches on them.
[6246.72 → 6246.92] I mean,
[6247.00 → 6247.82] some of the
[6247.88 → 6252.20] some of the Lamb stuff where we've only done 70 minus one unit,
[6252.38 → 6253.48] that's,
[6253.64 → 6254.78] that's pretty rare.
[6255.02 → 6255.96] We don't say that anymore.
[6256.82 → 6257.02] What?
[6257.12 → 6257.78] 69 units.
[6257.90 → 6258.14] Nice.
[6258.32 → 6258.48] Okay.
[6258.70 → 6258.90] Yeah.
[6258.98 → 6259.50] I don't care.
[6259.68 → 6260.14] I didn't know.
[6260.26 → 6260.42] I'm,
[6260.48 → 6261.14] I'm meeting.
[6261.24 → 6261.60] I was like,
[6261.62 → 6262.82] are you avoiding this for a reason?
[6263.04 → 6263.78] I wasn't sure.
[6264.30 → 6264.70] Um,
[6264.70 → 6267.60] I thought you were being Drake for a second.
[6267.74 → 6267.96] I mean,
[6267.96 → 6268.80] more than 92.
[6268.98 → 6269.40] Pretty much,
[6269.50 → 6271.26] pretty much anything that we,
[6271.42 → 6272.78] pretty much anything that we order,
[6272.88 → 6274.50] we have to order hundreds of.
[6274.72 → 6274.86] So,
[6275.00 → 6275.14] yeah.
[6275.98 → 6276.82] Some of the pins,
[6276.98 → 6278.26] some of the pins in the
[6278.38 → 6279.46] in the like RGB.
[6280.16 → 6280.56] Yeah.
[6281.24 → 6284.06] I was wondering like maybe going all the way back to like the
[6284.06 → 6285.56] the original logo shirt,
[6285.80 → 6287.74] like way back or the keep on digging shirt.
[6287.74 → 6288.42] Oh,
[6288.70 → 6291.18] the like me in a box coming out of it.
[6291.52 → 6291.94] Like one,
[6292.70 → 6298.92] I think only like four of them exist or something like that from the café press store that we set up back when I was at NCI.
[6299.10 → 6300.72] I ruined mine very recently.
[6300.72 → 6301.20] Actually.
[6301.26 → 6301.74] Oh no.
[6301.84 → 6309.86] I washed it and just the ink had not aged well, and it just completely disintegrated in the wash.
[6310.02 → 6310.32] God.
[6310.58 → 6310.78] Yeah.
[6310.88 → 6311.14] Bummer.
[6311.14 → 6314.50] All right.
[6314.58 → 6315.82] What are we supposed to be talking about Dan?
[6316.22 → 6317.30] Are we supposed to be doing topics?
[6317.54 → 6317.66] Oh,
[6317.72 → 6320.36] you have five and a half minutes left until eight o'clock.
[6320.58 → 6322.38] Twitter blocks is in the
[6322.42 → 6323.18] is in the doc.
[6323.56 → 6323.86] Oh,
[6323.92 → 6324.14] hello.
[6324.68 → 6324.92] Uh,
[6324.94 → 6325.12] yeah.
[6325.20 → 6325.32] Well,
[6325.32 → 6325.80] I totally,
[6326.10 → 6327.28] I totally missed that.
[6327.42 → 6328.02] Great work.
[6328.18 → 6330.00] Everyone who worked on the doc on that.
[6330.52 → 6330.96] Yeah.
[6331.06 → 6331.30] So that,
[6332.68 → 6333.16] my bad.
[6333.54 → 6336.60] Some users are calling this a win for stalkers while proponents,
[6336.60 → 6337.38] uh,
[6337.38 → 6339.92] argue blocked users could already view public content.
[6339.92 → 6340.18] Yes.
[6340.60 → 6340.96] Yeah.
[6341.14 → 6341.54] Okay.
[6341.66 → 6341.88] No,
[6341.96 → 6343.00] we need to talk about,
[6343.00 → 6344.00] um,
[6344.14 → 6344.90] the U S,
[6345.16 → 6345.46] uh,
[6345.46 → 6348.50] a U S appeals court has sided with music publishing giant,
[6348.60 → 6353.56] Sony universal and Warner against ISP Grande communications,
[6354.16 → 6359.76] concluding that Grande purposefully ignored customers who were engaging in copyright infringement
[6359.76 → 6362.32] and should have taken action up to,
[6362.46 → 6366.82] and including the termination of the accounts of some of these customers.
[6366.82 → 6373.48] Another ISP Cox Communications is attempting to appeal a similar ruling to the Supreme Court.
[6373.48 → 6378.92] Cox argues that copyright infringement notices sent on behalf of record labels aren't reliable,
[6378.92 → 6386.16] and that forcing ISPs to disconnect users based on unproven piracy accusations will cause great harm.
[6386.16 → 6387.44] A Supreme,
[6387.44 → 6387.56] a Supreme,
[6387.56 → 6400.26] a Supreme court brief filed by multiple ISPs argues that the ruling against Cox imperils the future of the internet by exposing internet service providers to massive liability.
[6400.26 → 6403.88] If they don't carry out mass internet evictions.
[6403.88 → 6412.12] It further argues that this decision potentially harms other residents at the disconnected address who may have had no involvement in the infringement.
[6412.12 → 6415.06] Your parents are going to be so mad.
[6415.06 → 6421.28] This appeals court ruling is crazy,
[6421.74 → 6423.54] crazy.
[6424.62 → 6425.06] Um,
[6425.92 → 6426.12] I,
[6426.34 → 6426.80] there are,
[6426.98 → 6427.32] there,
[6427.38 → 6428.74] we have not even touched on,
[6428.84 → 6433.80] we have not even scratched the surface of the potential problems with a ruling like this.
[6433.90 → 6437.50] Like imagine being an educational institution.
[6438.50 → 6440.06] You're the IT admin,
[6440.06 → 6450.76] and now it's your job to have an absolutely bulletproof system for making sure that nobody downloads any copyrighted materials or what your internet goes out.
[6451.22 → 6453.40] Because the ISP is not going to want the liability.
[6453.40 → 6458.88] Do you have any idea what kind of damages they seek for every single instance of copyright infringement?
[6459.70 → 6461.52] The numbers are ridiculous because they don't,
[6461.68 → 6465.22] they don't go based on like that movie would have been 20 bucks or whatever.
[6465.22 → 6466.08] Like it's like,
[6466.10 → 6466.70] it's crazy.
[6466.70 → 6467.58] They want like tens,
[6467.58 → 6469.80] tens of thousands of dollars per,
[6469.92 → 6470.68] per instance.
[6470.78 → 6470.98] Right?
[6471.10 → 6473.46] So ISPs are going to be,
[6473.62 → 6474.02] if this,
[6474.14 → 6475.64] if this happens for real,
[6475.90 → 6485.10] ISPs are going to be trigger freaking happy to cut off anything that looks like it could possibly be anything that could get them in trouble.
[6485.66 → 6487.22] This is freaking wild,
[6487.36 → 6487.64] dude.
[6488.40 → 6488.88] VPN.
[6488.88 → 6490.46] Oh yeah.
[6490.56 → 6490.76] Hey,
[6490.98 → 6491.54] Dan,
[6491.68 → 6493.88] do you have our PIA affiliate thing?
[6494.04 → 6494.62] It's automated,
[6495.02 → 6495.48] unfortunately.
[6495.80 → 6495.92] Oh,
[6495.98 → 6496.08] it's,
[6496.18 → 6496.88] it's automated.
[6497.08 → 6497.78] What does that even mean?
[6498.26 → 6498.42] It,
[6498.56 → 6501.66] it appears during Banner After Dark randomly.
[6502.10 → 6502.38] Oh.
[6503.76 → 6504.52] I just mean,
[6504.56 → 6505.00] do you have the link?
[6505.06 → 6505.78] Do you want to put it in the chat?
[6505.98 → 6506.20] Oh,
[6506.60 → 6506.94] oh,
[6507.02 → 6507.32] oh,
[6507.32 → 6507.46] oh,
[6507.46 → 6507.58] oh,
[6507.58 → 6507.84] okay.
[6508.04 → 6508.20] Yeah.
[6508.20 → 6509.44] I thought you wanted me to put it on screen.
[6509.76 → 6510.16] Now's,
[6510.66 → 6510.94] look,
[6511.18 → 6516.56] a VPN is not a silver bullet for like cybersecurity or whatever.
[6516.56 → 6517.24] Um,
[6517.24 → 6517.46] that,
[6517.58 → 6518.30] that's not a thing.
[6518.96 → 6519.36] Um,
[6519.82 → 6520.26] but,
[6520.68 → 6525.10] but it will make it so that they can't tell that you're downloading pirated stuff.
[6525.20 → 6525.98] It will do that.
[6526.46 → 6527.20] So thanks,
[6527.30 → 6527.44] Dan.
[6528.58 → 6528.82] Yeah.
[6528.82 → 6529.04] Sick.
[6529.76 → 6530.20] Uh,
[6530.20 → 6530.40] Dan,
[6530.44 → 6531.88] can you also throw the carabiner link in?
[6531.94 → 6533.24] There's a couple of people asking about it.
[6533.30 → 6533.54] Sure.
[6533.62 → 6534.34] Just to make sure they get it.
[6534.58 → 6535.48] Thank you so much.
[6535.48 → 6535.92] You're wonderful.
[6536.58 → 6537.24] All right.
[6537.96 → 6539.08] Should we after dark it?
[6539.14 → 6541.34] I'm running on little time.
[6541.78 → 6542.32] Let's do it.
[6542.80 → 6543.50] It's after dark time.
[6543.50 → 6547.06] I just tasked Dan with like two things though.
[6547.18 → 6548.80] So how's he going to switch us to after dark mode?
[6548.94 → 6551.02] He would have to be some kind of magic man.
[6551.38 → 6551.68] Oh,
[6551.74 → 6552.38] you did it.
[6554.12 → 6554.72] Doing the
[6554.86 → 6555.14] what a guy,
[6555.28 → 6555.74] what a guy,
[6555.90 → 6557.30] what a guy is a little harder.
[6559.10 → 6560.66] And then we do scene.
[6560.82 → 6561.00] Sorry.
[6561.28 → 6561.94] He's on it.
[6562.36 → 6563.40] I'm trying to do two things.
[6563.40 → 6564.12] Let's watch him work.
[6565.38 → 6567.86] And then we go also here.
[6567.86 → 6569.82] Have you ever had this many people judge you at once?
[6570.72 → 6571.08] Yeah.
[6571.10 → 6572.24] I've been to a family reunion.
[6572.86 → 6573.30] Got him.
[6573.50 → 6579.14] And is it magenta?
[6579.30 → 6579.98] I actually haven't looked.
[6580.10 → 6580.50] There it goes.
[6581.20 → 6581.48] Nice.
[6581.60 → 6582.18] Are you going to do it?
[6582.28 → 6582.60] Thank you.
[6582.68 → 6582.92] Nice.
[6583.80 → 6584.14] All right.
[6584.18 → 6585.94] That should be the links and everything else.
[6586.04 → 6587.42] Let's get through some of these.
[6588.70 → 6589.68] And we'll put them away.
[6590.64 → 6590.94] Cool.
[6591.98 → 6592.26] I'm good.
[6592.34 → 6592.46] I'm good.
[6593.24 → 6593.56] Hey,
[6593.82 → 6594.82] Land and Dynast,
[6594.98 → 6596.80] saving for a commuter backpack.
[6596.80 → 6598.48] Question for the small boss.
[6598.90 → 6599.72] As a cereal fan,
[6599.82 → 6601.80] have you tried milk bar in Vegas or LA?
[6601.80 → 6602.36] LA.
[6603.00 → 6604.78] It's not an alcoholic bar.
[6604.92 → 6606.70] They have cereal, milk, ice cream.
[6607.02 → 6608.92] I'm going to have to try that at CES this year.
[6609.56 → 6610.68] I have not heard of that.
[6610.80 → 6611.40] Milk bar.
[6611.64 → 6612.42] A cereal bar.
[6612.66 → 6612.92] Yeah.
[6613.18 → 6615.44] That sounds genuinely more interesting to me than...
[6616.48 → 6618.16] But you can just get them at the grocery store.
[6618.34 → 6618.88] Like, need your grain.
[6619.08 → 6619.72] Oh my goodness.
[6619.72 → 6621.90] The second I said cereal bar,
[6622.00 → 6622.22] I was like,
[6622.24 → 6623.32] this is going to come back to me.
[6623.64 → 6624.32] I don't know how,
[6624.44 → 6625.00] but it will.
[6625.42 → 6626.08] Happened fast.
[6628.58 → 6630.16] Is that a confer you're going to CES this year?
[6631.06 → 6631.56] Oh yeah.
[6631.64 → 6632.30] I got to go.
[6632.96 → 6633.26] Yeah.
[6633.42 → 6634.00] It's just a thing.
[6634.54 → 6635.90] I think it's just a thing.
[6635.98 → 6636.92] I think that...
[6636.92 → 6640.02] I think that I tried real hard to not have to go
[6640.02 → 6642.58] and nothing against the team,
[6642.70 → 6643.46] but I need to go.
[6644.46 → 6645.18] He's got to go.
[6645.36 → 6645.88] I got to go.
[6646.78 → 6647.50] Like on purpose?
[6647.50 → 6650.70] Uh, good day, LLD.
[6651.26 → 6655.10] I have a new job as a senior FS dev.
[6655.20 → 6656.10] I assume that's full stack.
[6656.54 → 6658.74] The tech department is less than a year old
[6658.74 → 6660.48] and doesn't follow best practices.
[6660.70 → 6662.60] How would you suggest I push for change?
[6662.80 → 6663.54] Leading by example?
[6664.30 → 6666.18] Most tech departments that are a year old
[6666.18 → 6667.46] aren't going to follow best practices.
[6667.90 → 6669.10] Also, spoiler alert,
[6669.24 → 6671.78] most tech departments that are any amount of years old
[6671.78 → 6673.00] aren't going to follow best practices.
[6673.92 → 6674.36] Yeah.
[6674.46 → 6675.38] Try to lead by example.
[6675.52 → 6676.08] Do what you can.
[6676.08 → 6677.70] Push for certain pieces of change
[6677.70 → 6679.26] that you think are going to be most impactful.
[6680.40 → 6682.90] Work with your, I don't know,
[6682.94 → 6685.08] your managers, whoever else in there to try to...
[6685.76 → 6687.82] Like, there's this thing that like,
[6687.88 → 6689.38] if you want to get stuff done,
[6690.04 → 6693.08] propose solutions or options.
[6693.72 → 6693.80] Yeah.
[6693.92 → 6695.36] Don't just complain about stuff.
[6695.56 → 6697.06] And keep realistic expectations.
[6697.46 → 6697.66] Yeah.
[6697.80 → 6700.46] Because your manager probably has 10 trillion things to do
[6700.46 → 6702.40] because most companies don't have enough.
[6702.40 → 6704.66] I find most companies either don't have enough
[6704.66 → 6706.86] or they have like about seven times too many.
[6707.22 → 6710.04] There doesn't seem to be a lot of like right in the middle.
[6711.00 → 6712.36] So try to, yeah.
[6712.46 → 6714.36] If you're like, you know what?
[6714.40 → 6716.86] I'm going to look up a few different good options
[6716.86 → 6717.96] for doing this thing.
[6718.18 → 6720.64] I'm going to A, B, and C these options,
[6720.78 → 6721.78] show the pros and cons,
[6721.86 → 6722.90] show the one that I vote for,
[6722.92 → 6723.88] and I'm going to hand this over.
[6723.88 → 6726.64] You're very likely to get something done
[6726.64 → 6729.26] compared to like, I don't like me
[6729.26 → 6731.98] or just not saying anything
[6731.98 → 6734.40] and hoping that it gets fixed magically.
[6734.62 → 6736.84] That's a real fun one.
[6736.90 → 6737.46] I love that.
[6737.60 → 6738.46] Everybody loves that.
[6738.52 → 6739.00] It's very useful.
[6739.12 → 6739.88] It works really well.
[6741.22 → 6742.06] Stop complaining.
[6742.56 → 6744.06] But yeah, I wouldn't sweat.
[6744.16 → 6745.24] I wouldn't sweat it too much.
[6747.78 → 6749.22] It's pretty common.
[6749.82 → 6750.68] But yeah, moving on.
[6751.48 → 6751.78] Hi, DL.
[6751.78 → 6754.24] Who do you think will be the main benefactor
[6754.24 → 6756.56] of the newly announced x86 alliance?
[6756.76 → 6760.18] AMD, Intel, software vendors, or end consumers?
[6762.20 → 6763.22] AMD and Intel.
[6764.46 → 6767.48] Actually, I think other members of the ecosystem
[6767.48 → 6768.86] will benefit as well,
[6769.50 → 6772.50] just from not having to deal with
[6772.50 → 6775.44] like a diverging x86.
[6777.34 → 6780.56] Actually, I think it's kind of a win overall.
[6780.56 → 6784.28] Industry cooperation and standardization
[6784.28 → 6786.72] is probably the only reason
[6786.72 → 6789.64] that you can even plug the same USB devices.
[6789.88 → 6790.34] Not probably.
[6790.68 → 6792.70] Is the only reason that you can even plug
[6792.70 → 6796.42] the same USB-C cables into Apple and PC computers.
[6796.70 → 6798.52] Like it's generally a good thing.
[6798.52 → 6804.68] I don't necessarily know that it's going to be the...
[6806.68 → 6809.12] I don't think it's necessarily going to mean
[6809.12 → 6810.98] that x86 wins forever,
[6810.98 → 6813.26] but I think it will strengthen x86,
[6813.58 → 6814.90] which in general is good.
[6815.24 → 6816.86] Better, stronger competitors
[6816.86 → 6818.22] means more competition for us,
[6818.26 → 6819.34] means better products for us.
[6820.50 → 6821.38] I'm into it.
[6821.62 → 6823.88] It's pretty wild seeing Pat Gelsinger
[6823.88 → 6825.72] and Lisa Sue like on stage together.
[6826.76 → 6828.62] Like, what timeline is this?
[6828.68 → 6830.14] All we needed was Jensen up there
[6830.14 → 6831.54] and I'd be like, okay, I quit.
[6831.68 → 6831.96] I'm done.
[6832.20 → 6832.58] This is it.
[6832.66 → 6834.46] This is peak tech industry
[6834.46 → 6835.58] and it's all downhill from here.
[6835.84 → 6836.10] Yeah.
[6836.82 → 6837.22] Weird.
[6837.22 → 6837.30] Weird.
[6838.50 → 6839.36] Oh, okay.
[6839.58 → 6839.82] What's up, because?
[6840.20 → 6840.48] You know?
[6842.04 → 6843.36] We're going to get new colours.
[6843.80 → 6844.72] The weird blue one.
[6845.42 → 6846.20] We're going to get purple.
[6846.86 → 6847.52] Hey, LLD,
[6847.68 → 6849.50] with the float plane exclusive shirt
[6849.50 → 6851.38] be a permanent fixture on the store
[6851.38 → 6852.20] or is it a limited run?
[6852.60 → 6854.14] Very short term.
[6854.26 → 6854.86] Is drop.
[6855.18 → 6855.58] Yes.
[6858.20 → 6859.52] Any earbuds you'd recommend?
[6861.84 → 6863.56] There are a lot of videos on earbuds
[6863.56 → 6864.40] on the Short Circuit channel.
[6864.40 → 6868.20] Yeah, I mean, I love my AirPods Pro 2s.
[6868.54 → 6870.90] The AirPods 4s with ANC.
[6871.10 → 6872.76] Actually, if you,
[6872.92 → 6875.74] especially if you don't like the silicone tips,
[6876.84 → 6880.10] I was floored by how decent,
[6880.58 → 6883.16] by how decent the ANC was.
[6883.92 → 6884.78] It's decent.
[6884.90 → 6885.80] It's solid.
[6886.44 → 6888.34] I was very surprised by that.
[6888.52 → 6888.68] Yeah.
[6888.78 → 6889.94] I've heard that from a lot of people.
[6890.22 → 6890.36] Yeah.
[6891.98 → 6893.68] The FP shirt is already selling out.
[6893.68 → 6895.04] Is it, is that even a thing?
[6895.08 → 6895.66] Is that possible?
[6895.84 → 6897.82] I thought it was like a.
[6897.94 → 6898.16] What?
[6899.32 → 6900.64] How do we sell at a pre-sale?
[6901.08 → 6901.36] Yeah.
[6901.80 → 6902.42] What are you talking about?
[6905.02 → 6905.46] Uh.
[6907.60 → 6909.60] They look like they're here to me.
[6912.14 → 6912.50] Oh.
[6913.50 → 6916.08] Oh, there may be some colours of blanks
[6916.08 → 6917.94] that we, uh,
[6918.42 → 6919.80] only have a limited amount of.
[6919.80 → 6922.52] We might be clearing out our olive blanks.
[6922.76 → 6923.12] Oh.
[6923.72 → 6924.68] Black large.
[6924.88 → 6925.10] No.
[6926.24 → 6926.60] Uh.
[6927.64 → 6928.76] That seems rough.
[6928.84 → 6929.04] Huh.
[6929.52 → 6929.90] Um.
[6930.74 → 6932.94] Maybe we should find out.
[6933.92 → 6934.28] Cool.
[6934.48 → 6935.78] Dan, you want to hit us with another one
[6935.78 → 6936.32] in the meantime?
[6936.88 → 6937.04] Sure.
[6937.84 → 6938.24] If team.
[6938.24 → 6938.62] One for me.
[6938.94 → 6939.16] What?
[6939.26 → 6939.74] If possible.
[6940.42 → 6941.80] Because he's calling someone, I think.
[6942.40 → 6942.64] Mm-hmm.
[6943.46 → 6943.70] Sorry?
[6944.08 → 6944.58] If possible.
[6944.66 → 6945.00] One for me.
[6945.06 → 6945.72] He's calling someone.
[6945.84 → 6946.84] If teams is so bad,
[6946.90 → 6948.80] why can't you make your own home chat system?
[6948.88 → 6949.84] Oh, God.
[6951.94 → 6953.32] That's a stupid question.
[6956.12 → 6957.42] I'm in pain.
[6961.38 → 6962.20] Oh, man.
[6962.28 → 6963.30] What do I even say?
[6963.30 → 6963.66] Um.
[6964.10 → 6964.90] I mean, there's a lot of.
[6965.02 → 6965.36] We'll use mumble.
[6966.04 → 6966.36] Yeah.
[6967.14 → 6967.54] Nice.
[6968.20 → 6968.58] Um.
[6969.18 → 6969.52] Hold on.
[6969.92 → 6970.16] Hi.
[6970.28 → 6970.50] Uh.
[6970.50 → 6972.14] Mr. Nick, you're live on the WAN show.
[6972.14 → 6973.38] Oh.
[6974.12 → 6974.52] Oh.
[6974.68 → 6974.88] Wait.
[6975.00 → 6975.30] Hold on.
[6976.98 → 6977.18] Oh.
[6977.44 → 6978.94] Why is my speaker so quiet?
[6980.42 → 6982.22] I have a sleeping baby on my lap,
[6982.28 → 6983.56] so I'm talking quietly.
[6983.76 → 6984.08] Oh.
[6984.18 → 6986.72] He has a sleeping baby.
[6987.44 → 6987.88] Um.
[6988.06 → 6988.44] Okay.
[6988.56 → 6989.76] People are wondering about
[6989.76 → 6992.62] why the dinosaur shirt is selling out.
[6992.98 → 6994.32] Because it's a pre-sale, right?
[6995.42 → 6996.98] I would have to confirm.
[6997.32 → 6998.72] I know we're pretty light on blanks.
[6998.72 → 6999.86] We have some coming in right now.
[7000.80 → 7001.16] Ah.
[7002.14 → 7002.32] Ah.
[7002.96 → 7003.28] Okay.
[7003.48 → 7003.92] Duly noted.
[7004.04 → 7004.54] Thank you.
[7005.26 → 7005.50] All right.
[7005.56 → 7005.68] Bye.
[7005.92 → 7006.40] See you later.
[7006.54 → 7007.10] Have a wonderful.
[7008.74 → 7009.62] Oh, and he's gone.
[7009.78 → 7011.48] Well, have a wonderful something, I guess.
[7011.56 → 7012.30] He'll have to imagine.
[7012.78 → 7015.08] He'll have to imagine what I'm wishing him a wonderful of.
[7015.70 → 7017.38] Well, if you want a large,
[7017.62 → 7019.80] I guess you can get all of.
[7020.28 → 7024.64] And if you want a double XL or triple XL,
[7024.64 → 7027.42] I guess you can get a black.
[7028.68 → 7029.32] And if you want a tall.
[7029.32 → 7031.12] Look, inventory management is hard, okay?
[7031.12 → 7031.62] It's screwed.
[7031.80 → 7033.68] And if you want a blue so it matches the site.
[7033.70 → 7034.86] I'd like to see you do it better.
[7034.94 → 7035.32] Go away.
[7035.32 → 7035.60] Got him.
[7037.22 → 7037.58] Okay.
[7038.00 → 7039.72] We're working on making tools to make it easier.
[7039.72 → 7040.14] Yeah, I know.
[7040.52 → 7040.74] Yeah.
[7041.18 → 7041.66] Hit me, Dan.
[7041.66 → 7045.20] That's kind of all I have for the curated.
[7045.46 → 7046.50] There's a couple more here.
[7046.58 → 7047.48] Maybe let's see.
[7048.54 → 7051.56] I was wondering where the stuff on the store gets stored.
[7051.82 → 7055.24] I'm guessing you don't have it all on site with you guys.
[7055.24 → 7055.44] No.
[7055.98 → 7061.28] We use a third-party logistics company that's actually run by one of my former colleagues from NCI.
[7062.02 → 7063.54] It's on Animus Island, actually.
[7064.20 → 7065.92] We talked about Animus Island earlier.
[7066.04 → 7066.28] Yeah.
[7066.28 → 7077.56] And we actually did a pop-up there once when we launched the backpack because it was impractical to move because the backpack is so large.
[7077.56 → 7081.88] It was impractical to move, like, a significant number of them to somewhere else to do it.
[7081.92 → 7084.08] So we just did it out the back of their warehouse.
[7085.24 → 7085.76] I remember that.
[7085.76 → 7091.68] I think it would actually be kind of cool to do a tour of it or something, but maybe not.
[7091.76 → 7092.78] I mean, it's not high-tech.
[7093.00 → 7094.52] Like, it's pretty low-tech.
[7094.72 → 7095.72] I've never even been there.
[7096.94 → 7099.68] I've only been there once for the backpack pop-up.
[7099.68 → 7104.10] Maybe, like, a tech quickie on, like, how do you get things?
[7104.72 → 7107.62] And it goes through, like, the logistics process when you order something.
[7108.24 → 7109.52] Which is super cool, by the way.
[7110.08 → 7113.16] Yeah, except that, like, again, ours is pretty low-tech.
[7113.82 → 7114.20] Yep.
[7115.76 → 7117.56] Yeah.
[7118.70 → 7120.18] Only there's a way to order something.
[7120.34 → 7121.08] There isn't.
[7121.58 → 7126.22] No, like, our blanks are our own blanks, and we don't have a blue one.
[7126.30 → 7127.64] I'm telling you, like, we don't have one.
[7127.88 → 7128.16] Yeah.
[7128.68 → 7130.40] We can't just, like, order some.
[7130.40 → 7134.22] There are blanks, and we don't have a blue one.
[7134.48 → 7134.70] Yep.
[7136.00 → 7138.80] But we have a microfiber shirt.
[7138.84 → 7143.92] And I don't think you want that shirt in blue microfiber with the design on it.
[7143.92 → 7144.42] Yeah.
[7147.06 → 7147.42] Yeah.
[7147.64 → 7151.56] I also would, you know, like the full blank shirt to be in blue.
[7151.66 → 7153.58] It's just not going to happen because we don't have blue blanks.
[7153.62 → 7156.32] We sold 150 microfiber T-shirts today.
[7156.78 → 7159.66] I don't think our inventory is going to last very long on those.
[7160.04 → 7161.48] That is freaking hilarious.
[7161.68 → 7162.74] You guys are hilarious.
[7163.00 → 7163.74] You know that, right?
[7164.26 → 7165.76] Like, do you actually know that, though?
[7165.76 → 7168.88] I seriously wonder how many of them are selling because they look like Star Trek shirts.
[7169.60 → 7170.32] You think so?
[7170.94 → 7172.28] They, like, really kind of do.
[7172.36 → 7173.88] They really kind of do, don't they?
[7174.28 → 7176.66] Especially with, like, the way the light kind of catches them.
[7176.82 → 7178.40] And the thick black collar.
[7178.60 → 7180.18] That was not intentional.
[7180.30 → 7180.74] No, I know.
[7181.04 → 7182.30] I didn't see it at all.
[7182.58 → 7182.86] Yeah.
[7182.94 → 7184.48] And now I cannot unsee it.
[7184.54 → 7185.42] And then I was like, whoa.
[7185.62 → 7187.60] I can't unsee it.
[7187.74 → 7188.00] Yeah.
[7188.56 → 7189.74] At least you guys aren't wearing red.
[7189.74 → 7191.24] Oh, damn, I got my...
[7191.24 → 7192.34] I tried to do the...
[7192.34 → 7193.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7194.54 → 7194.86] Sorry.
[7195.18 → 7195.50] Okay.
[7196.18 → 7198.56] Yeah, we aren't wearing red, so we'll survive the night.
[7198.74 → 7198.94] Yeah.
[7198.94 → 7199.00] Yeah.
[7202.54 → 7205.22] And I guess I got one more curated, and that's probably about it.
[7206.00 → 7207.04] Hi, LLD.
[7207.20 → 7212.86] Paradox Interactive admitted last week that releasing Cities Skylines 2 in the state that it did was a mistake.
[7213.18 → 7217.82] Do you think this is indicative of a larger intolerance for unfinished games?
[7217.82 → 7234.88] I think that one was also kind of a unique situation where the original game had changed so much from its original release state that they were kind of in a difficult position where, yeah, there were problems,
[7234.88 → 7244.84] but also one of the biggest problems was that the modding ecosystem for the original game was so good and so vibrant that they actually...
[7244.84 → 7251.64] Like, they had kind of no hope of matching the feature set of the new game, but also of the old game at launch.
[7251.64 → 7257.66] Like, it was always going to take a long time, but they also, like, screwed it up by having technical issues and stuff.
[7257.86 → 7258.64] I...
[7258.64 → 7259.64] Yeah.
[7261.34 → 7262.98] Like, it's clear they screwed up.
[7263.16 → 7266.50] I mean, the CEO said as much, but I don't know that if it's...
[7266.50 → 7274.84] I don't know that it's because people are generally less tolerant of unfinished games so much as it's that that was a pretty unique situation.
[7274.84 → 7278.32] I do think, though, that people don't understand what beta means anymore.
[7278.56 → 7278.66] Yeah.
[7279.42 → 7280.58] Oh, but did it launch in a beta?
[7280.92 → 7282.14] No, I don't think it even did.
[7282.26 → 7285.82] I do think people's expectations of anything they can use are pretty high.
[7286.12 → 7286.50] Oh, yeah.
[7287.00 → 7287.84] So...
[7287.84 → 7290.54] To be fair, companies poisoned that well.
[7292.00 → 7292.52] 100%.
[7292.52 → 7292.84] 100%.
[7293.50 → 7295.94] Oh, Minecraft is in beta for, like, a decade.
[7296.14 → 7298.00] Yeah, Insomniac says it's the Sims problem.
[7298.22 → 7302.78] Every new release is so basic, it doesn't feel like a finished game until there's a bunch of expansion packs.
[7302.78 → 7303.80] Yeah, yeah, totally.
[7304.74 → 7306.94] Civ, to a lesser degree, suffers that.
[7307.06 → 7310.58] I find most Civ games are better after one or two expansions are out.
[7310.72 → 7313.48] Dim says, there were basic features and functionality missing.
[7313.76 → 7315.06] Give me my bike lanes.
[7315.16 → 7315.32] Yeah.
[7316.24 → 7317.26] Yeah, 100%.
[7317.26 → 7317.78] Like, they...
[7318.50 → 7322.78] I can see where the ambition was in Cities Skylines 2, but...
[7323.94 → 7326.02] It's clear that there were blind spots.
[7329.36 → 7330.14] I don't know.
[7330.22 → 7331.24] I don't know what they could have done.
[7331.24 → 7335.06] Other than just eat it and work on it for longer.
[7337.20 → 7338.50] Sometimes isn't an option.
[7339.26 → 7342.14] Top Gear, Lux is not coming back.
[7342.68 → 7345.64] For those of you planning on buying for family on Christmas.
[7346.06 → 7348.26] It is October the 18th.
[7349.22 → 7351.82] I just told you, we just sold the last of the inventory.
[7351.98 → 7353.76] Where do you think new ones are going to come from?
[7353.76 → 7356.38] This may surprise people.
[7356.48 → 7359.30] There are legitimately people that this is going to surprise.
[7359.72 → 7364.72] But the items on our store are not just rebadged AliExpress stuff.
[7365.72 → 7367.04] I know, right?
[7367.26 → 7368.56] The water bottles are rebadges, right?
[7368.80 → 7369.04] Yep.
[7369.34 → 7369.52] Yeah.
[7369.52 → 7370.34] Yes.
[7370.52 → 7373.88] But even then, we do our own production runs.
[7374.12 → 7377.60] We don't just, like, go to the corner store...
[7377.60 → 7377.80] Yeah.
[7377.90 → 7380.34] ...and buy one and then put our label on it.
[7380.38 → 7380.56] Yeah.
[7380.56 → 7383.56] So production lead times are long.
[7384.18 → 7385.02] And we have our own lid.
[7385.28 → 7389.86] But, like, most of the things that people know the store for are our own things.
[7390.52 → 7390.64] Yeah.
[7390.64 → 7394.72] Our own shirt blanks, screwdrivers, backpacks, all that kind of stuff is our own engineering.
[7394.90 → 7395.96] That wasn't always the case.
[7396.80 → 7401.70] Desk pads and water bottles carried the store for probably, like, a year and a half, two years.
[7402.20 → 7404.46] But nowadays, the revenue is...
[7404.46 → 7405.20] Didn't we make...
[7405.20 → 7406.82] Aren't the desk pads their own thing?
[7406.90 → 7407.60] That's not a rebranding.
[7407.60 → 7409.56] They're our own design, and they're to our own spec.
[7409.56 → 7410.00] Okay.
[7410.26 → 7412.34] They are our own custom thickness.
[7412.34 → 7414.10] That wouldn't mean that it's a rebranding then, though.
[7414.78 → 7415.64] Oh, okay.
[7415.66 → 7415.90] Yeah.
[7415.90 → 7417.48] If it's our own spec and our own thickness.
[7417.84 → 7420.70] So we're talking the OEM versus ODM.
[7420.82 → 7422.02] So this is OEM.
[7422.50 → 7425.42] And then I would say the desk pad is ODM.
[7425.50 → 7425.64] Yeah.
[7425.68 → 7427.24] Because we gave the design guidelines.
[7427.44 → 7427.62] Yeah.
[7428.38 → 7429.40] That's its own product.
[7429.68 → 7431.02] It's probably in between.
[7431.18 → 7432.94] Not as much so as a screwdriver.
[7433.24 → 7433.48] Yeah.
[7433.56 → 7434.10] No, not even...
[7434.10 → 7434.92] Yeah, not even close.
[7435.08 → 7435.82] Different category.
[7436.88 → 7437.96] I know it's, like, six months out.
[7437.96 → 7438.94] It's still not a rematch.
[7438.94 → 7441.12] Can we maybe get another pre-order, says Top Gear.
[7441.20 → 7444.10] It's like, dude, if you want something, you have to, like, you have to order it.
[7444.66 → 7445.42] I, uh...
[7445.42 → 7446.04] Oh, man.
[7446.14 → 7447.12] I don't know.
[7447.20 → 7454.48] Because it was made by our old backpack supplier who, spoiler alert, isn't the one making these.
[7454.70 → 7454.90] Oh!
[7455.10 → 7455.72] There goes the water.
[7457.16 → 7460.48] And that, my friends, is why you closed the lid on your water bottle.
[7460.92 → 7463.24] Hey, we have some cloths that aren't going to be very absorbent.
[7463.46 → 7464.22] Uh, oh.
[7464.58 → 7465.08] Well, okay.
[7465.08 → 7466.66] Hey, we have some cloths that are more absorbent.
[7466.66 → 7467.72] Hey, we've got a Dan.
[7467.98 → 7469.16] So, yeah, we have...
[7469.16 → 7474.38] We have a new manufacturing partner for our backpack products, and I don't know if they're
[7474.38 → 7477.86] going to be able to source exactly the same Apple leather material.
[7478.48 → 7480.72] There's definitely some...
[7480.72 → 7485.66] There are definitely some differences in terms of, uh, how we had to optimize the construction
[7485.66 → 7489.00] for the thicker materials so they wouldn't have that knowledge.
[7489.00 → 7491.32] We'd be basically doing product development on it again.
[7491.94 → 7492.92] Which, what?
[7493.08 → 7494.52] To sell another couple hundred units?
[7494.72 → 7495.32] I...
[7495.32 → 7497.72] I don't know if it's going to make sense.
[7498.04 → 7501.70] And besides, I'm sure all the people who actually bought it, because, you know, they
[7501.70 → 7503.34] were like, hey, this is a thing that I like.
[7503.52 → 7505.80] Maybe you make a luxe commuter bag.
[7508.72 → 7509.66] I can set it back.
[7510.30 → 7511.24] I was getting it out of the water.
[7511.62 → 7511.78] Oops.
[7512.96 → 7514.22] Thank you, I guess.
[7514.36 → 7514.78] There we go.
[7515.04 → 7519.26] Uh, and besides, I'm sure the people that did buy it are going to like knowing how exclusive
[7519.26 → 7519.66] it is.
[7520.92 → 7521.30] There you go.
[7521.30 → 7523.90] Like, it's not numbered or anything, but it's pretty darn exclusive.
[7524.30 → 7525.24] There you go.
[7525.24 → 7526.44] What the heck, you guys?
[7526.60 → 7527.40] It's not that complicated.
[7527.40 → 7528.40] What did you even do?
[7531.02 → 7531.38] Brutal.
[7532.74 → 7533.32] Oh my goodness.
[7533.32 → 7534.20] How did we even move it?
[7534.22 → 7535.92] It's not like the electronics were in the water.
[7536.34 → 7537.40] I didn't know how it was.
[7537.52 → 7539.08] Yvonne's, Yvonne's always like that.
[7539.16 → 7540.76] Like, water will get, like, near something.
[7540.88 → 7542.30] She's like, oh, this is the electronic.
[7542.50 → 7543.76] I'm like, yeah, but this is a plastic housing.
[7543.86 → 7544.20] It's okay.
[7544.78 → 7544.98] Yeah.
[7544.98 → 7546.88] She's like, but I'm like, yeah, no, it's fine.
[7546.98 → 7548.56] I don't trust all the cables that much.
[7549.32 → 7549.84] This is true.
[7549.90 → 7550.40] This is fair.
[7552.52 → 7553.68] We've had these for a long time.
[7553.68 → 7554.70] We've been through some stuff.
[7554.70 → 7555.68] All right, Top Gear.
[7555.82 → 7556.64] All right, Top Gear.
[7557.90 → 7561.14] I will ask the team if it's a thing we can do, okay?
[7561.94 → 7562.56] I'll ask.
[7564.04 → 7565.84] Oh, Top Gear, no.
[7566.98 → 7567.22] What?
[7567.62 → 7568.84] He just looks so sad.
[7568.90 → 7569.36] I know.
[7569.46 → 7570.78] He looks so sad.
[7570.94 → 7575.54] He's got, like, tears streaming down his face, crying emoji.
[7575.70 → 7576.60] Like, Geez, okay.
[7577.28 → 7578.46] Like, I don't know, man.
[7578.52 → 7582.18] It's kind of a funny thing because the number of people that are upset
[7582.18 → 7584.76] that the flannel shirts are gone, the plaid flannels are gone.
[7585.12 → 7588.98] And I'm like, dude, they were rotting in our inventory.
[7589.24 → 7590.32] We had to blow them away.
[7590.60 → 7592.38] If you guys like stuff, buy it.
[7592.68 → 7596.44] If you don't like it, then don't complain that it's gone.
[7596.44 → 7601.10] I do think that sometimes we have a hilarious way of handling seasons.
[7601.66 → 7603.36] Oh, dude, we don't do them.
[7603.66 → 7604.28] Because, like...
[7604.28 → 7605.38] When stuff's done, it's done.
[7605.62 → 7606.98] And it's in, and it's in the store.
[7607.04 → 7609.62] The season for flannels showed up, and then we don't have flannels.
[7610.92 → 7611.32] 100%.
[7611.32 → 7612.24] 100%, man.
[7612.52 → 7612.94] Nope.
[7613.88 → 7614.12] Yep.
[7614.12 → 7615.62] Not even lying.
[7616.12 → 7616.76] Not even lying.
[7616.80 → 7617.20] I don't know about that.
[7619.78 → 7620.18] All right.
[7620.90 → 7621.82] Well, hey.
[7621.96 → 7622.14] Is that the show?
[7623.32 → 7625.04] Thanks for, uh, thanks for watching.
[7625.34 → 7626.24] We'll see you again next week.
[7626.40 → 7628.10] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[7628.94 → 7629.42] Bye!
[7632.16 → 7633.84] I was so ready for that.
[7635.22 → 7636.02] Ready for what?
[7636.82 → 7639.66] That outro came in so fast after I said bye.
[7641.10 → 7642.28] I'm getting efficient here.
[7642.28 → 7644.80] Except they're waving.
[7645.44 → 7646.28] Waving to jump.
