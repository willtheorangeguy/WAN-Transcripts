2:17:17 This is the outro timestamp.

[EDIT] ALRIGHT! I listened. I came back.and.finished the rest of the timestamps, slightly reluctantly because this is much harder than it seems with ADHD. I'm exhausted now. I hope the original timestamp guy got compensated decently in some way for his work. Send illicit or pharmaceutical stimulants for next week.]

[The following paragraph was from the first version of this post, before I came back and edited it to complete the rest of the timestamps, as stated in the edit notes above:]
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm done with this today. I made it more than halfway. I didn't realize how much I usually skip around, and I feel like no one is even going to see these timestamps at this point since I didn't check out this WAN Show until a whole day later. I have a lot more respect for the OG Timestamp Guy (Noki) now. If this gets a fair amount of engagement with latecomers then I might finish this later or tomorrow, but I think most people watch within the first 12-24 hours.

#################################

[EDIT #2: YouTube needs to get their DAMN ACT TOGETHER and improve the functionality of their garbage comment section. It seems timestamps were already posted long before I did them, despite me and dozens of others being unable to find them. Although if LMG won't do the timestamps themselves so we don't have to each rent an excavator to dig through the comments, it probably wouldn't be that difficult for someone at LTT to set a script that alerts them when someone comments with a list of timestamps. That way they can pin the comment THEN, shortly after it's made, instead of nearly 3 DAYS after the show had aired and timestamps were commented.

Apparently the OG Timestamp Guy, Noki, had already posted timestamps about 12-18 hours before me, even though before I even started typing them up, I carefully scrolled through the comments until all the way to what YouTube told me was the bottom/end of the comments section, and I saw no other timestamps among any of the comments.

Also, at that time when I was checking to see if someone else had done them yet, out of hours worth of recent comments, the number #1 most frequently made type of comment was still just people expressing their disappointment or frustration regarding a perceived lack of any timestamps, despite the fact that Noki had apparently posted them 12+ hours prior at the time, and likely had hundreds of likes on his timestamp comment by that point (yet was for unknown reasons not yet sorted towards the top of "Top Comments").]

Please excuse me: This is a shorthand timestamp meant to promote the full supplemental timestamp.
Copy-paste &lc=UgyKbF45FyLC4jpmVvZ4AaABAg to the URL to go there.
I don't know why it's not being seen by lots more people when Noki's or others' timestamps seems to be seen easier.

[2024-09-21T00:09:10Z] Video: YouTube Showed Me Their New AI In Person - WAN Show September 20, 2024 
I'm not sure if it's just my browser or officially-9y.o laptop, but there's a behavior in clicking proceeding timestamps that it plays 5s before the clicked timestamp.
For example, current playtime is 05:00, you click a 13:00 timestamp, it plays on 12:55.

I may know where this change is coming from: that they wish to give some context before the timestamp. However, this misrepresents timestamps to be pointing to the precise time it's pointing at.
Let me know if you observe this, too.

Thank you.

Subtopics _(the indented ones)_ are very contextual from the the flow of the source topic, so even the subtopics may not be as accurate.
Let me know of sub/topic rephrasings/suggestions/corrections, if any.
