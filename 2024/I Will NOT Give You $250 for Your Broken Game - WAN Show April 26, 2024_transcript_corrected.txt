[0.00 → 7.08] what is up everyone welcome to the WAN show wow that's all the energy I can muster today
[7.08 → 14.08] sick in any other universe where breaking the streak was an option I think I wouldn't be here
[14.08 → 21.62] today but let's go what are your two topics and I almost pulled all-nighters so we're going to get
[21.62 → 27.72] into why that was and uh why we're here anyway uh what else we got today oh right
[27.72 → 34.48] TikTok is banned but no for real this time but wait no maybe not you know what no you're right
[34.48 → 41.18] that topic sucks it's boring okay Mozilla blasts dating apps for dropping their privacy standards
[41.18 → 47.92] and this is um a bigger deal even than it sounds like I was floored when I was reading through this
[47.92 → 54.54] okay what else we got today uh gamers escape from Markov it might finally be over if the
[54.54 → 62.68] cheaters weren't enough we've got a boozy for you uh also nice I don't know what else uh net
[62.68 → 71.12] neutrality might be back uh FCC votes to restore obama uh era rules repealed under trump
[71.12 → 77.52] we're restoring Obama I mean you look you see the see the pictures the day he started his term
[77.52 → 82.44] and the day his term ended we're going to restore him boys we're gonna we're going to put that black hair back
[82.44 → 85.34] he's going to look less haunted
[85.34 → 93.26] dude's seen some stuff oh boy just roll the intro we got this
[94.26 → 104.80] wait what pretty sick huh this is awesome
[104.80 → 118.76] yeah dad dead in the corner
[118.76 → 130.30] oh man that's great that's awesome pretty cool hey did you see that on Reddit uh I saw the post but I
[130.30 → 135.22] never ended up actually watching it I meant to, but I think I just oh my god so that's pretty great
[135.22 → 140.68] it's amazing it's like it really raises the question of why did we ever bother to try to create
[140.68 → 148.26] our own intros for anything you know that the LTT uh 3d1 is based on uh just a random viewer that
[148.26 → 154.32] created that and then we oh we reached out to them, we had it tweaked and uh, and now I didn't know
[154.32 → 161.10] we used that as well wow yeah that's pretty great yeah it's its pretty cool like that must have been
[161.10 → 165.32] correct me if I'm wrong guys if you're in the audience, and you're going like oh yeah that's
[165.32 → 170.92] really simple or something then by all means let me know, but that looked like a freaking ton of work
[170.92 → 177.72] to me yeah absolutely incredible uh we have one of the most and I'm not just blowing smoke we have
[177.72 → 183.66] one of the most talented viewer bases out there uh when I see stuff like that it just absolutely
[183.66 → 193.76] blows my mind so that that was super cool um I feel terrible for not knowing the name of the person
[193.76 → 203.00] who submitted it do we have that handy yes that's a by Nate C absolutely killed it um he remade a special
[203.00 → 208.28] version for me without the ending credit so that I could put our sponsors over it uh even supplied
[208.28 → 213.52] the font that was going to be for it um super awesome that is so cool did we give him did we
[213.52 → 220.12] give him money I don't know we can follow up if you want okay um yeah lets uh yeah I'm going to send
[220.12 → 226.14] a message to uh to Vance, and I'm going to make sure that some money leaves our bank account while you do
[226.14 → 231.24] that you were talking about amazing we have a very creative community uh escape from Markov has a very
[231.24 → 236.86] angry community uh escape from Markov developer battle state games has angered fans by releasing
[236.86 → 245.40] a new 250 us dollar version of the game you heard it right after taxes and fees and everything else
[245.40 → 249.84] this is like almost 400 Canadian dollars or something like that I don't remember exactly
[249.84 → 256.60] um but the fees and taxes are pretty brutal as well it is wildly expensive have you not heard of
[256.60 → 265.24] this no okay this is why I wanted to include this topic dude I've done nothing but shoot videos and
[265.24 → 271.88] inhale paint fumes this week, so I have no idea what's going on yeah 250 us dollar uh version of the game
[271.88 → 282.56] the pricey new unheard edition uh includes access to an offline Eve co-op mode which uh supports all of
[282.56 → 288.26] the quests and everything else that the main game does all able to be done in Eve co-op that's
[288.26 → 293.36] actually pretty cool like I would probably enjoy that version of the game more because the reality
[293.36 → 299.58] of it is I love the concept, but I'm not sweaty enough to play Markov yeah hold on though that
[299.58 → 303.98] existing at all yeah is not why people are mad yeah we'll get there in a second right because people
[303.98 → 311.18] love the idea that's a thing yeah totally people have been begging for this for I don't know it's the
[311.18 → 317.08] whole time the game has existed so yeah totally no problem as long as they're not plastic bagging
[317.08 → 319.60] those are banned then everything's good
[319.60 → 323.44] sorry my brain's a little stupid today
[323.44 → 332.48] okay this uh Eve co-op mode will have persistent progress so when the game wipes it won't
[332.48 → 338.42] reset every time um cool yeah so those things are good right like like like balder's gate
[338.42 → 342.12] or whatever like you could have like a campaign that you're playing with your friends yeah and
[342.12 → 347.18] you're, and you're it's a co-op mode so if is yeah is you can't play all the time out of that
[347.18 → 352.60] yeah exactly me too yeah I would there 's's um because like every time I touch Markov it's wiped
[352.60 → 357.84] like I just I's not the kind of thing that I can commit to playing every day or every other day
[357.84 → 364.42] I genuinely think every time we have played you've had a fresh character so it is what it is um
[364.42 → 371.12] uh yeah I think it's fantastic there 's's unsanctioned they don't like it uh this is I don't
[371.12 → 376.12] know the where the legality lies on this, but there's like this thing called SPT Markov where
[376.12 → 381.68] it's single player Markov and there is an unofficial co-op mode thing, but those are all uh battle state
[381.68 → 386.78] games fights against those and doesn't like those are uh they think they're bad, so this is like
[386.78 → 394.24] an official one um the game's official Twitter account has confirmed that this mode is exclusive
[394.24 → 403.08] to the 250 us dollar pre-taxes pre-fees unheard edition this is a big deal okay huge deal hold
[403.08 → 407.98] on I have a big question here yeah how did they know that I hadn't heard about it
[407.98 → 415.72] I just hit my face against the mic that made me facepalm so hard um
[415.72 → 424.88] this is a big deal since the uh yeah there you go it's a big deal since the 150 us dollar
[424.88 → 430.62] edge of darkness edition which is no longer available for purchase promised buyers free
[430.62 → 437.84] access to all subsequent LCS and there is actually on the Subreddit uh there's a screenshot
[437.84 → 444.32] of a tweet are they arguing this is they're arguing that it's a feature it's not a DLC
[444.32 → 451.52] well what the heck is a DLC yeah what is the difference there's a tweet
[451.52 → 458.78] go for it can we get together and define what exactly DLC means because
[458.78 → 464.54] as far as I can tell it's a catch-all term it's content you don't okay well tell me this
[464.54 → 467.42] do you download this or do they mail it to you
[467.42 → 476.60] I would I it would be so funny if is they mailed this to everyone
[476.60 → 482.96] to like try to get around it that would be hilarious I mean that would explain the cost
[482.96 → 488.84] yeah I still don't think so um there's a there's been what they're mailing you Luke
[488.84 → 494.28] have you ever tried to mail a box of weasels like we don't know what they're mailing
[494.28 → 503.60] oh man no sleep blindness is a heck of a thing um the uh what was I going to say there 's's been
[503.60 → 507.94] quotes from them before about saying how like EOD or edge of darkness is supposed to be the
[507.94 → 512.76] the highest tier they're ever going to release um there's a screenshot of a tweet that says you don't
[512.76 → 517.82] need to buy anything at any stage if you have EOD you don't even have to pay for LCS in the future
[517.82 → 525.46] you're all in for all of it coming um it's its yeah and this would also tie in with the fact that
[525.46 → 533.88] EOD or edge of darkness with this all LCS thing has existed I think since 2017 or 2016 even yeah I'm
[533.88 → 542.72] not sure, but it's been at least 2017 and um the only thing cable that has been available to them
[542.72 → 549.12] has been a very recent release of something called Markov arena which oh no way I would argue
[549.12 → 556.66] the vast majority of future yeah, and then they never delivered content and that well they delivered
[556.66 → 561.82] partially and then decided that they're not anymore I'll pray they don't alter it further
[561.82 → 568.20] I mean is the Markov audience this Stockholm syndrome that they just this is their game
[568.20 → 572.68] I don't think so anymore like that's the way that I see it every time I play Markov dude I'm like
[572.68 → 580.86] look if I wasn't living and breathing the meta of this game there is absolutely no way like I couldn't
[580.86 → 586.52] I couldn't possibly hope, and some games aren't like that some games you can drop in six months later and
[586.52 → 591.62] fundamentally kind of know what you're doing you know you jump into Team Fortress 2 it's like oh
[591.62 → 597.90] there are new hats you know whatever I'm probably going to get beamed by a know flying squirrel or
[597.90 → 605.22] something um but but but Markov it really does feel like if you're not on top of it you just have no
[605.22 → 612.50] idea so presumably then this is the game that a lot of these people play and this is going to sound
[612.50 → 620.28] crazy this is going to upset some people but 250 dollars over a span of let's say let's say it's a
[620.28 → 625.72] year let's say it's a year that they this is going to upset some people you know they actually yeah that
[625.72 → 631.82] they actually have this be the top tier or whatever that's 20 bucks a month compared to what some
[631.82 → 638.38] people out there who play one game are spending on their cosmetics are spending on their microtransactions
[638.38 → 650.78] it's not even that crazy now one second I would never pay it absolutely not yeah and theoretically what I'm trying to say is dude
[650.78 → 657.44] people are going to pay it yes and some people already have some streamers already have uh which was a
[657.44 → 661.90] little disappointing it's going to learn nothing uh I think they're going to learn something actually
[661.90 → 668.78] uh their really player bases their player base is extremely on fire right now the uh the Subreddit is
[668.78 → 675.14] on fire people are trying to spin up uh like lawsuits because again there was a version that said you get
[675.14 → 679.44] all DLC they've been quoted saying that you don't have to pay anything again because you own all the
[679.44 → 685.72] things and then now they release something that is uh incredibly more expensive than it was before
[685.72 → 690.96] um and there 's's there 's's continued issues we're not even through the main body of this
[690.96 → 695.32] this topic there's a lot to talk about here you mentioned there being no other games i have to jump
[695.32 → 702.44] in for a second though yeah because timestamp guy no key he's coming in correcting me on Team Fortress 2
[702.44 → 707.96] says you often use tf2 as an example, but they haven't added any new weapons since jungle inferno
[707.96 → 713.32] 2017 metas pop up sometimes, but nearly everything has been static ever since okay well
[713.32 → 718.64] let me tell you something no key I play Team Fortress 2 once every approximately three years
[718.64 → 729.60] yeah so sorry yes you're you're you're probably right my big moment for tf2 was when they
[729.60 → 735.14] started adding all the like random weapons and I was just like oh okay now I have to pay attention to
[735.14 → 740.24] this game a lot you're right uh it's not really a huge issue anymore because valve has kind of moved
[740.24 → 746.18] on to other money making endeavours but uh it was an example back then and I should have clarified
[746.18 → 752.46] because I should have known that they haven't added any weapons since jungle inferno 2017 thank you very
[752.46 → 758.02] much no key and can we just get a little bit of appreciation for no key those times every week like an
[758.02 → 767.14] absolute chat yeah all right thank you uh flow plane customer support Joe in flow plane chat said
[767.14 → 771.34] offline co-op progression servers are slammed with 20 to 30-minute queue times people are buying it so
[771.34 → 778.70] I'm sad um which this is like man that is the most if EOD buyers so people who bought the edge of
[778.70 → 782.48] darkness edition that said they got all the free DLC, and they never need to pay for anything again if
[782.48 → 788.02] those people upgraded their accounts that's like the most I feel like this is like an outdated term
[788.02 → 794.74] but that's like the most beta thing ever they just scammed the hell out of you wow it's going to be you
[794.74 → 800.56] with the hot takes yeah they just scammed the hell out of you, and you were like all right yeah please
[800.56 → 805.76] take more of my money uh you just abused me here let me financially support you further so
[805.76 → 811.26] yeah that's that's a little weird to me, I don't I don't support that at all but anyway uh moving
[811.26 → 816.30] forward I'm going to try to get through more of this topic, and then we can discuss oh no, no I'm
[816.30 → 823.04] not actually I'm gonna tangent again you said there's no other games um funny timing uh there's
[823.04 → 828.72] a very recent game now in early access is it an early access no it's you can just request it I think
[828.72 → 831.96] they had a play test recently or something I'm not really sure what's going on with this but gray zone
[831.96 → 837.98] warfare is a game that has like uh it's its not the same thing, but it will probably capture a very
[837.98 → 846.18] similar audience also uh, uh during this battle state games I think most notably Nikita got in a
[846.18 → 853.52] direct argument with another game called arena breakout infinite that they are claiming um is a
[853.52 → 859.74] direct rip-off of Markov, so maybe there is an alternative for people um, but we'll see
[859.74 → 868.58] oh my god i just read the next bullet point this is unbelievable in an attempt to fix the
[868.58 → 876.40] situation battle state games CEO Nikita beyond took to Reddit to announce this is great they're
[876.40 → 883.18] giving edge of darkness buyers access to the offline Eve mode this is less great for six months yeah
[883.18 → 890.30] that is unhinged yeah that's not even the next bullet point though there's more uh this is a
[890.30 → 896.36] super you know super hardcore game you die you lose all your stuff um and this edition of the game is
[896.36 → 904.98] directly unquestionably pay to win in multiple ways uh you've you've played so you might pay to win
[904.98 → 913.78] co-op game Luke no, no no, no I mean pay to win this the features are in co-op but also in the
[913.78 → 924.72] main game, so there's there are things like uh let me see if I can find yeah here we go wait no this is
[924.72 → 932.20] update regarding the EOD edition uh you know I hate to I hate to generalize but can gamers grow a
[932.20 → 939.34] backbone a little bit yeah like the gaming community has to be one of the most whiny communities
[939.34 → 946.44] but when it comes time to actually just do something or better yet not do something just
[946.44 → 952.92] don't buy it they can't and I realize I've probably gone on this rant before but like
[952.92 → 958.76] this is just embarrassing I mean look I don't think you're allowed to use the term beta male anymore
[958.76 → 960.02] maybe not I don't know
[960.02 → 968.06] it's for real it's just like you're getting you're getting abused and then giving them more money
[968.06 → 973.62] yeah it's like it's i I don't maybe there's a more correct current term I don't I don't know what it
[973.62 → 984.62] is um but yeah let me read through some of the features of this edition um fine I'm not even
[984.62 → 987.94] going to read through all of them because one of them's like digital copy preload which is like
[987.94 → 993.86] who cares so access to that Eve mode that's cool um I wish there were other ways to buy it so you
[993.86 → 998.18] didn't have to spend an amount of money that most people don't even have to spend on video games at
[998.18 → 1005.30] all let alone uh one of them uh increased stash size so that's like mostly a way you
[1005.30 → 1016.14] you get a bigger stash so hold on it's so much worse it's so much worse no um expanded PMC pockets
[1016.14 → 1023.40] so while you're playing you have a limited amount of inventory space the game works, and it has a very
[1023.40 → 1030.24] complicated and important economy uh and being able to take more things out of the raid will make it so
[1030.24 → 1035.94] that in future raids you're going to be better geared because you have a better financial situation
[1035.94 → 1041.98] and having increased pocket sizes cumulative effect yeah so before like uh you know whatever
[1041.98 → 1047.84] it'll have a snowball effect because if you can take so much more stuff out you can carry out more
[1047.84 → 1053.30] stuff to sell you can, and then you can buy cooler stuff which means you can kill people even
[1053.30 → 1057.86] more easily and bettered and raid their stuff and take even more of it this is ridiculous, and it makes
[1057.86 → 1061.90] it so that if you're trying to do a run where you're trying to be very economic you can actually
[1061.90 → 1067.66] bring less stuff in because not only do you have more pocket slots before you had four one by one
[1067.66 → 1074.80] pocket slots now you have two one by one pocket slots and two by one pocket slots so you have
[1074.80 → 1078.96] tall I'm beginning to think that you can put like full-size magazines I think there isn't
[1080.44 → 1086.94] I don't dude I don't think that there is a scandal big enough to make gamers wake up like literally
[1086.94 → 1093.98] this version of the game could be called give me your money bitch edition internally yeah
[1093.98 → 1099.56] that could be the internal code name that might even be that could leak and gamers would do it anyway
[1099.56 → 1106.94] yeah yeah uh so in addition to the pockets and the stash size you also have an increased uh
[1106.94 → 1113.12] like uh reputation standing with one of the characters in the game called fence so that you can
[1113.12 → 1118.76] sell more stuff on the flea market which is like player to player selling, and you have more slots
[1118.76 → 1123.28] on the flea market so you can put more things on the flea market which is directly going to mean
[1123.28 → 1129.42] that you're going to be able to make more money faster which is a huge portion of the game uh you
[1129.42 → 1136.08] get a unique in-game melee weapon which people found was uh just an asset from the unity asset store
[1136.08 → 1141.98] directly taken they didn't do any form of modification to if it's just literally straight up an asset from the
[1141.98 → 1146.60] asset store I don't remember if it was like a free asset or like a six dollar asset or something but
[1146.60 → 1152.80] they just like joke you're the asset yeah pretty much um increased mail retention time so like if
[1152.80 → 1159.16] you if you buy insurance oh yeah uh if you buy like insurance in the game or something like that
[1159.16 → 1159.54] look
[1159.54 → 1166.70] most people don't play Markov, so there's a lot of people watching this that are probably going
[1166.70 → 1171.38] I don't understand these things a big deal out of this yeah and I get this I get this every time
[1171.38 → 1176.52] that I talk about something that apple's doing that is super anti-consumer as well where you know
[1176.52 → 1181.96] you'll have the usual crowd of well Linus just hates apple just don't buy it you'll, you'll get you'll
[1181.96 → 1188.12] get that sort of that chorus of bad takes where people are missing the big picture here the big
[1188.12 → 1196.04] picture is that this is a is a precedent now and outrage we have a limited capacity for outrage
[1196.04 → 1203.06] right we were so outraged and I know we talk about this one a lot we were outraged about horse armour
[1203.06 → 1212.20] in oblivion nowadays we're basically like men this game's great because all their uh DLC is
[1212.20 → 1220.82] cosmetic and not balance shifting, or you know what uh we can maybe allow for that this skin this
[1220.82 → 1226.32] really popular skin um is kind of more camouflaged on this map and that map you know what we'll still
[1226.32 → 1231.92] accept that you know what I mean realistically you could farm for ammo for that super op gun
[1231.92 → 1237.90] so you don't have to buy you don't have to buy ammunition so I guess that's okay and I know that
[1237.90 → 1245.10] slippery slope arguments are not very good arguments but when you are slipping down the slope
[1245.10 → 1251.86] actively tumbling head over heels like what's going on with this Markov situation where they are
[1251.86 → 1260.70] taking a game that where balance is everything to the experience and messing it up and charging you a
[1260.70 → 1272.70] bunch of money um my connection didn't actually die there i just my brain is slow today because I didn't
[1272.70 → 1277.54] sleep last night and I ran out of steam so I thought if I just stopped moving then maybe they'll think
[1277.54 → 1285.84] that it was the connection i uh I brought up the trailer and got some like visual representations of
[1285.84 → 1290.64] of some of the pay to win things so here's your increased stash size here's your increased PMC
[1290.64 → 1295.54] pockets you can see how uh these are taller so you can fit full-size magazines in your pockets
[1295.54 → 1301.10] now that was never possible before um so now you could go without attack rig um so you're you're
[1301.10 → 1306.10] spending less money on doing future raids your character skills are just increased this was
[1306.10 → 1311.64] already a weird thing in my opinion because people who could play the game for a living would have higher
[1311.64 → 1319.50] base skills because it would take an obscene amount of hours to level these skills up um and now people
[1319.50 → 1325.78] that uh maybe work for a living and then spend money on the game can also have increased skills and that
[1325.78 → 1331.94] can directly make it so that if you play exactly the same uh the person with the higher skill count
[1331.94 → 1337.90] could beat you because some of these things are like you won't bleed as easily, or you're uh more
[1337.90 → 1343.36] accurate or reload faster with guns you can run for longer you can carry more stuff you can uh jump
[1343.36 → 1348.34] higher what like if you're is your strength is high enough in the game uh you can jump onto things
[1348.34 → 1352.70] that other people can't like it's its being able to have higher skills is directly pay to win right
[1352.70 → 1359.78] uh and then down here improve starting equipment set um which is less of a big deal in my mind
[1359.78 → 1367.26] uh and then moving forward a bunch of stuff every cool idea that battle state games implements here
[1367.26 → 1375.66] is something that we will see implemented somewhere else when inevitably gamers just lie down and take it
[1375.66 → 1385.52] and there are no consequences so here it is this is my call for anyone who is actually into Markov because
[1385.52 → 1392.16] they're the only ones who can make a set a precedent here who can say look this is too far
[1392.16 → 1399.36] don't play it yeah like seriously set a calendar set a calendar look I get if it's your favourite game
[1399.36 → 1407.28] that's chill set a calendar notification for yourself for six months at least a temporary boycott
[1407.28 → 1412.08] will send a message like yeah it might not affect their wallet because realistically you already bought
[1412.08 → 1419.76] the game anyway or whatever um but what it will do is it will cause their concurrent player counts to
[1419.76 → 1425.22] decline it will send an actual message that they can actually understand it will degrade the gaming
[1425.22 → 1432.38] experience for new people who come in, and they're like this thing is empty um and to be clear it's not
[1432.38 → 1438.92] about punishing them it's about punishing battle state games it's about like look we are your community
[1438.92 → 1447.04] we are what makes your game good treat us with respect act like you deserve respect, and you might get
[1447.04 → 1456.74] some there that's it yeah oh wow uh six months boycott don't play
[1456.74 → 1468.84] whoa the uh the top oh no what now the top Markov streamer right now um I believe is streaming modded
[1468.84 → 1477.70] single player Markov which is a little unheard of in my mind uh 5 000 viewers are watching this person
[1477.70 → 1485.12] playing a modded version of the game which is like super not okay with Markov um I was just
[1485.12 → 1489.26] wondering I was going to go see like how many streamers are currently playing this i I wouldn't go after
[1489.26 → 1494.52] streamers that are playing the game it's really rough when like if you're is your entire income stream
[1494.52 → 1500.54] is based around like playing this one game even if the company that runs that game does something
[1500.54 → 1506.22] deplorable it's its rough to kind of fully pull out but maybe encourage people to try out
[1506.22 → 1511.54] alternatives like gray zone warfare um, or potentially it's not out yet and I know nothing about the game
[1511.54 → 1516.42] at all but arena breakout infinite alternate games that are in somewhat of a similar style that you
[1516.42 → 1521.64] think they might like, and their audiences might also like uh but I wouldn't go around don't go
[1521.64 → 1528.86] around like harassing streamers for playing it but yeah rough i uh I was already done because their
[1528.86 → 1534.30] response to the whole cheater situation was a giant nothingburger um and I'm not down to
[1534.30 → 1539.20] nice play a game like this with a bunch of cheaters and then when I first heard this announced
[1539.20 → 1547.96] I didn't see the price tag and I saw the uh the co-op Eve mode and I was so stoked because I was like
[1547.96 → 1554.46] we're back this game is super sick it's not going to wipe I can play with like Linus or Joe or whoever
[1554.46 → 1559.06] else is a bunch of different people that I play with um it'll be fun we don't have to deal with
[1559.06 → 1567.20] any of that kind of stuff and uh then I was like ah no yeah no I don't want anyone to buy this so i
[1567.20 → 1571.94] guess that's never happening uh there's other weird stuff too like there's and there's an item that
[1571.94 → 1576.96] you can get I think this might only be if you have the unheard edition or something I'm not certain
[1576.96 → 1583.30] where scans the scavengers basically the AI characters in the game won't shoot you if you are
[1583.30 → 1589.94] uh 60 meters or more away uh but like only if you have this version so it's like it's its it's super
[1589.94 → 1595.32] pay to win um I don't think anyone that like enjoyed the hardcore realism nature of Markov should
[1595.32 → 1600.92] should honestly play anymore I think this entirely broke the game, but it's up to you guys make your own
[1600.92 → 1605.02] decisions moving on though next topic we're going to see what happens apparently that streamer got
[1605.02 → 1613.78] permission to stream that version of the game really from battle state apparently what apparently
[1613.78 → 1615.76] that's what float plane chat is saying
[1615.76 → 1624.32] unprecedented times anyway we can move on to our next topic they said they wouldn't DMCA
[1624.32 → 1628.22] I mean cool
[1628.22 → 1638.14] that's weird I don't know what that means okay uh but anyway um do you want to talk about Mozilla
[1638.14 → 1643.78] uh blasting dating apps this one's fascinating to me yeah according to an into the dating apps
[1643.78 → 1649.26] yeah yeah we're both very active in this realm uh according to a recent report with Mozilla
[1649.26 → 1654.34] dating apps are growing increasingly aggressive and invasive when it comes to collecting users
[1654.34 → 1659.10] personal information having declined significantly since the last time Mozilla reviewed their privacy
[1659.10 → 1666.44] practices in 2021 around 80 percent of the apps reviewed share or sell personal information
[1666.44 → 1672.44] and do not guarantee users right to delete their data most apps requires users to opt out of precision
[1672.44 → 1678.00] geolocation tracking and do not appear to adequately protect the data that they collect at least one
[1678.00 → 1684.90] catholic group was able to out a priest after buying grinder scruff and ok cupid user data
[1684.90 → 1693.60] grinder is also facing a class action lawsuit alleging that it unlawfully shared UK user shiv status with
[1693.60 → 1702.00] vendors something which grinder admitted to doing though it denies doing so for commercial purposes
[1702.00 → 1712.54] what uh you just did it because you thought it would be fun like what uh due to the nature of
[1712.54 → 1717.54] dating apps much of this information can be incredibly personal and revealing including religious affiliations
[1717.54 → 1723.20] political beliefs and sexual history these companies also automatically aggregate information from users
[1723.20 → 1729.84] devices social media third parties and the metadata of uploaded content like photos match group who own over
[1729.84 → 1736.74] 40 dating apps including tinder hinge match and ok cupid say that private dms are scanned by automated tools
[1736.74 → 1744.34] and may be reviewed by human agents if the bot flags potential illegal or unsafe behaviour however dms are also
[1744.34 → 1752.94] reviewed in order to evaluate train and improve their automated tools okay this one blew my mind because
[1752.94 → 1759.84] basically if it they left it at the beginning if they left it at okay there's something potentially unsafe here it has to be
[1759.84 → 1765.94] reviewed by a moderator you know what i kind of get that because inherent to a dating app you're going to have
[1765.94 → 1772.84] monstrous things happening you're going to have human trafficking potentially you know like you oh yeah that these platforms do have to be
[1772.84 → 1782.74] moderated to at least some degree yeah however saying look we can review basically anything we want for the purpose of
[1782.74 → 1793.74] evaluating training and improving our automated tools that's basically saying yeah it's like selling to a camera that's like yeah I'll just and I'll just
[1793.74 → 1803.94] tune into it whenever I feel like it um cool like i I haven't I haven't used a dating app before so I'm gonna sound
[1803.94 → 1815.80] potentially kind of out of touch here but i i I don't imagine that this is clear to the user when they sign up for this thing like guys
[1815.80 → 1826.80] are you on one of these platforms and was it clear that they might be you know collecting and sharing your sexual history and uh you know any
[1826.80 → 1839.50] infections you might have or man like reading your dms to like what I've I've heard tell that some of the younger generations are
[1839.50 → 1845.80] trying to go back to more archaic versions of dating skipping the whole dating app thing which I think
[1845.80 → 1848.64] is fantastic very good job keep going
[1848.64 → 1854.14] wow it's buried in the TOS I'm sure a lot of people are not saying
[1854.14 → 1863.92] these apps have also become significantly more gamified and addictive in part to cope with declining revenues and market share
[1863.92 → 1869.86] as millennials have gotten older and settled down gen z users have become the largest population of singles
[1869.86 → 1875.66] however they are typically less interested in hookups and casual dating than previous generations did I just get slut-shamed
[1875.66 → 1882.00] I think so our whole I think our whole generation did which you know sounds probably about accurate
[1882.00 → 1891.68] you know what pre-love man yeah man uh yeah the discussion question is there an inherent problem having
[1891.68 → 1896.96] platforms involved in something as intimate as personal dating uh I don't think it has to be
[1896.96 → 1905.68] but it looks like it obviously is respect yeah if you respect user data then no it shouldn't be
[1905.68 → 1908.60] a problem you should if you just make it so that all
[1908.60 → 1914.54] if you just make it so that you can't read dms unless you're like basically is brutal
[1914.54 → 1918.92] yeah I don't know why it's so delayed you're not that far away but I'm noticing the same thing
[1918.92 → 1925.48] um if is um it would be nice if they couldn't read any dms unless one of the users involved
[1925.48 → 1926.70] flagged the conversation
[1926.70 → 1930.42] that would make sense to me
[1930.42 → 1936.50] in float plane chat says when I was at this place we had a presentation by tinder exacts
[1936.50 → 1941.66] on data usage and getting to profitability, and it was a very creepy conversation
[1941.66 → 1951.82] yeah I don't I don't doubt that I don't doubt that at all but like this really does seem
[1951.82 → 1958.76] like the kind of thing that could be done, and it's its just it's just people you know power corrupts
[1958.76 → 1964.04] absolute power corrupts absolutely or whatever right like because people who enter personal
[1964.04 → 1970.88] information in a dating app compared to a political survey or compared to uh you know um a workplace
[1970.88 → 1979.74] profile survey or something like that assuming that they have um an earnest desire to find a
[1979.74 → 1986.58] partner um I was reading about how people will answer questions much more honestly and transparently
[1986.58 → 1993.26] because by hiding it they all they're the only person they're hurting is themselves and so
[1993.26 → 1999.98] all they had to do was say okay, and our service is to pair you up with someone
[1999.98 → 2005.92] and you pay us for that, and we don't have to have growth forever we don't have to have limitless growth
[2005.92 → 2015.42] i uh at risk of sounding like um like uh like an anti-capitalist man the and the
[2015.42 → 2021.66] and certification of everything just does seem inevitable when you have this mindset of needing
[2021.66 → 2027.76] growth growth growth forever yeah like at I understand it to a much greater degree now but
[2027.76 → 2035.14] especially when I was younger i would come across a news article that's like big company x has
[2035.14 → 2043.30] missed their estimated earnings that per share that analysts were expecting from them by
[2043.30 → 2052.04] two cents per share and their stock price tumbled 10 percent in other news they made 10 billion dollars
[2052.04 → 2057.12] this quarter and i would i would listen to that I'd be like sorry what so they make so they
[2057.12 → 2062.42] make you know hundreds of millions, or they make a billion dollars or billions of dollars in this time
[2062.42 → 2069.32] period, but they didn't do like as good or as we expected and that we were that we were gambling on
[2069.32 → 2076.32] that we had kind of priced into their their their Hambleton share price so what they need to do
[2076.32 → 2083.74] a bunch of stock buybacks who announced like huge stock buybacks just now I forget who it was
[2083.74 → 2091.20] but uh their share price when I think it was googled don't on this until I find it google surges
[2091.20 → 2099.26] after buying back billions of dollars of its own stock a day ago uh 70 billion dollars so you know why
[2099.26 → 2105.00] a company buys back stock there's two potential reasons one is they're expecting it to go up a lot
[2105.00 → 2111.46] um and so that could be you know good value to own more of their company if they're super confident
[2111.46 → 2116.28] they're going to like do awesome but do you know the real reason they do it I've had a share
[2116.28 → 2125.56] price goes up which is personal in yeah and the personal investments that the executives have
[2125.56 → 2130.18] in that company and that the shareholders have in that company go up it's just to enrich them
[2130.18 → 2135.60] personally, and you know when you look at a company like google over the last year or so you know what
[2135.60 → 2142.02] were the big bumps to their stock laying off a bunch of employees and using that money to buy a bunch
[2142.02 → 2146.80] buy back a bunch of stock I was talking about this on the pre-show but i was watching the john
[2146.80 → 2155.20] Oliver bit on um on Boeing really fascinating you can basically trace back their decline into
[2155.20 → 2161.06] scrappiness to the moment that they started spending their money on stock buybacks instead of on making
[2161.06 → 2170.60] a good product why don't we have systems why don't company implement systems that punish terrible
[2170.60 → 2177.36] terrible long-term thinking I don't understand it guys yeah i I always had this theory that maybe not
[2177.36 → 2182.94] stock buybacks to the tune of 70 billion dollars but I always had this theory that smaller size stock
[2182.94 → 2189.90] buybacks were based around uh a lot of companies do stock as compensation so I was like how do you how
[2189.90 → 2193.44] do you just keep doing that forever so you probably have to buy some of your own stock and then
[2193.44 → 2198.40] it makes this like cyclical thing where you're increasing the value of your stock by buying your stock
[2198.40 → 2203.56] and then giving stock to your employees which increases how much they want to potentially stay
[2203.56 → 2207.60] or try hard or whatever if that even works who know a little more complicated than that you can
[2207.60 → 2213.98] issue more stock without necessarily buying the stock does that dilute the value of the stock that you
[2213.98 → 2220.74] currently have though because you added more um I don't know this is like I genuinely don't know yeah
[2220.74 → 2229.14] yeah every company works a little bit differently okay if is Yvonne umbrella corporation group of
[2229.14 → 2236.30] companies had some kind of stock program um I personally would want to i would feel that we
[2236.30 → 2243.18] should take a bitcoin-like approach uh where not necessarily that you use GPUs or ASICS to mint more
[2243.18 → 2246.88] of the stock um you know I just like the stocks that's why I buy all these GPUs
[2246.88 → 2253.48] um so not from that point of view but from the point of view that they are finite and in order
[2253.48 → 2259.92] to issue incentives for example we would have to actually you know be profitable we'd have to
[2259.92 → 2266.06] actually own what we give someone um I don't know how that would work, and maybe I'm just you know naive
[2266.06 → 2273.84] but you know from my point of view it's its always been frustrating to me that um if i have
[2273.84 → 2280.48] something that's worth a value that someone can just like decide oh yeah no uh actually it's like
[2280.48 → 2292.58] less than that yeah oh well not financial advice guys not financial advice I'll be the first to admit
[2292.58 → 2297.76] that when it comes to when it comes to stocks when it comes to you know real world you know
[2297.76 → 2303.78] finance stuff I don't get it and i think part of it is almost just
[2303.78 → 2310.22] like a rejection of it like i actually not sure if i care to get it I don't have to play the game
[2310.22 → 2315.74] so maybe i just maybe I just won't maybe I'll take my ball and go home i I know that's a
[2315.74 → 2318.90] majority of it for me, i I hate it just feels so
[2318.90 → 2326.08] yeah I'm just not I'm not going to get into all the reasons why we'll get to a new topic uh EV company
[2326.08 → 2332.96] blows whistle on potential corruption this is uh this is one that hits genuinely close to actual
[2332.96 → 2338.82] home uh the government of British Columbia Canada is investigating allegations of potential conflicts
[2338.82 → 2345.50] of interest in how provincial low carbon innovation grants are administered this
[2345.50 → 2352.56] follows an allegation from CEO uh chase barber of Edison motors who claims that MNP a gigantic
[2352.56 → 2358.94] accounting firm involved in administering grants reached out uh to his company after declining
[2358.94 → 2365.14] their first application reached out his company after declining their first application okay uh
[2365.14 → 2369.44] according to the doc together a little quickly today folks yeah yeah it's its genuinely not their
[2369.44 → 2374.96] fault i i I'm just trying to piece it together um by the way just quick shout out Edison motors these
[2374.96 → 2380.16] guys are doing absolutely incredible work if anyone from Edison is watching right now we would love to do a
[2380.16 → 2385.92] video together that would be sick actually Alex from our team may be in touch but just want to
[2385.92 → 2391.66] just want to indicate my super willingness to come over there and check out what you guys are doing
[2391.66 → 2396.44] because it's outstanding it looks absolutely incredible that would be awesome uh according to
[2396.44 → 2402.96] barber uh rolling back just because it's been a little bit the CEO of Edison motors uh MNP offered Edison
[2402.96 → 2410.16] motors a service to help them apply for future grants which included a success fee of 20 of the
[2410.16 → 2418.32] grants of value ew uh should the application succeed it's unclear from publicly available information
[2418.32 → 2423.92] whether these grants included the ones that MNP was helping administer I'm going to pause there's more of
[2423.92 → 2430.00] this topic but I've heard of this a lot before with government grants where they're effectively impossible to
[2430.00 → 2436.00] get unless you partner with a company who takes a significant portion of the money which means that
[2436.00 → 2441.28] your government tax credits which are supposed to uh power innovation and business growth within your
[2441.28 → 2448.32] country uh are being diluted by middlemen that is the only way to actually get the business of
[2448.32 → 2453.04] being a worthless middleman is a business they're growing that business they should, we should find
[2453.04 → 2459.60] a way to delete all of them um anyway I'm going to move on uh barber says that he raised
[2459.60 → 2464.32] his concerns with the energy ministry uh in person and shortly after his company was
[2464.96 → 2472.00] disinvited from a promotional event by a government-funded lobby group for vehicle electrification
[2472.00 → 2477.76] Edison motors is the only company in the province that manufactures heavy-duty electric trucks
[2477.76 → 2484.08] MNP threatened by the way, and they're actually like genuinely very, very cool uh MNP has threatened to
[2484.08 → 2489.44] sue Edison motors which is a small privately owned company according to barber the company
[2489.44 → 2496.08] can't afford a legal battle with a billion-dollar company yeah uh neither could like most people
[2496.08 → 2502.88] so i I don't blame them um barber uh sorry uh and stated that he personally lives with his parents
[2502.88 → 2508.56] because as far as my understanding goes he has invested like everything he can into the company
[2508.56 → 2516.08] which is the like driven dedicated that's what we should be trying to encourage yes like what we should
[2516.08 → 2520.32] want out of entrepreneurs as people Edison motors has been everything that it takes to kill it and
[2520.32 → 2524.16] we should be supporting that they've been pushing limits of technology they've been pushing limits of
[2524.16 → 2528.96] quality they've been doing all these things that like we British Columbia should be very proud
[2528.96 → 2535.04] of this company and be trying to prop them up not trying to step on their neck, so this is very
[2535.04 → 2541.20] frustrating uh we've got a couple discussion questions even if MNP hasn't technically done anything wrong
[2541.20 → 2545.36] shouldn't Edison motors be allowed to raise concerns without the threat of a company crushing lawsuit
[2546.96 → 2552.64] yeah absolutely I mean you should be able to raise concerns about anything ever and the worst case
[2552.64 → 2558.24] scenario should be you know hey we've um we've investigated your concerns, and we don't agree with
[2558.24 → 2565.52] them like you can't be punished for real I mean honestly though there are so many things that are like
[2565.52 → 2572.24] this I mean uh the U.S. is finally growing a spine about the whole realtor thing uh how difficult it
[2572.24 → 2579.52] is to sell a home without a realtor and how those fees have absolutely ballooned in recent decades
[2579.52 → 2586.00] to the point where the simple job of being a sales rep and helping you list your house and fill out some
[2586.00 → 2594.08] paperwork has turned people into these multi zillionaires um and to be clear I'm not down on anyone who's
[2594.08 → 2598.48] busting their butt as a realtor I understand that it's one of their skill sets there being a twitch
[2598.48 → 2606.00] streamer yeah where the the the one percent that are crushing it are sort of over-represented in
[2606.00 → 2612.80] our in our perception but actually most of them are struggling to sell a house whereas those few that
[2612.80 → 2617.76] are succeeding have you know a team of people working for them, and they're basically just parasitically
[2617.76 → 2625.28] taking money from them um I get that but also just the business of being a middleman should be
[2627.04 → 2634.64] fine, but it shouldn't be this lucrative, and you know what Luke i I don't want to get too much into
[2634.64 → 2642.80] it, but we've as a company had experiences that strike me oh yeah not that dissimilar to this oh yeah I've
[2642.80 → 2649.20] directly been involved with some of them yeah and none of this should be necessary you should be
[2649.20 → 2656.32] able to fill out the paperwork the right way and submit your application according to the process that
[2656.32 → 2662.32] is on your government's website, and it should be processed in priority sequence, and then it should be
[2662.32 → 2669.36] dealt with um okay you know what fine I'm saying it Yvonne is still chasing some kind of credit that we've
[2669.36 → 2677.68] been due since 20 I think 2018. Like what I'm sure if we knew someone that wouldn't be the case and
[2677.68 → 2681.84] the biggest problem with that because like if you're hearing this yes that's that's a
[2681.84 → 2686.96] very very very very long delay that is pretty ridiculous it's 2024 now that's six years
[2687.68 → 2693.92] the biggest impact of that to me is not something that we necessarily even felt that much which is if
[2693.92 → 2699.04] you're not as that was when we needed the money exactly we're still here six years later
[2699.36 → 2707.12] we needed it then yes if you're is you're a smaller uh startup company you need everything you can
[2707.12 → 2713.04] possibly get because you don't have a lot of assets, yet you don't have a significant amount of cash flow
[2713.04 → 2719.60] yet probably um all these other things you need that capital to be able to keep progressing so by
[2719.60 → 2726.48] holding it for this long and making it so hard to get what you're really doing is only enabling large
[2726.48 → 2735.04] companies to be able to get this uh this money which in a lot of cases they probably didn't even
[2735.04 → 2739.60] really need it might benefit them they might be able to do a little bit more from it but they
[2739.60 → 2743.84] probably didn't like need it and the companies that really needed it is could have made or break
[2743.84 → 2749.68] their whole company, and then they'd be they'd be fine after that are generally unable to get it so
[2749.68 → 2756.72] very frustrating so shout out Edison motors yeah these guys are doing super cool stuff uh we'd love
[2756.72 → 2760.72] to collab with them and see if we can get them some much-needed attention and see if we can
[2760.72 → 2766.16] drive some business their way honestly what I suspect is that their bottleneck because the product is
[2766.16 → 2771.36] super cool what I suspect is that their bottleneck is more just capital which is probably why this is
[2772.16 → 2776.48] so frustrating for them, I'm speculating right now, but you know when your tech is that cool
[2776.48 → 2782.32] I suspect its production capacity that's holding them back right now not my having a cool product
[2782.32 → 2791.44] my grandpa used to work in financing for semi trucks um it these things are expensive i I'm sure a new
[2791.44 → 2795.84] company trying to get into the space isn't going to be able to produce an enormous amount of them all
[2795.84 → 2806.08] the time um there's a there are a lot of costs involved so yeah sponsor time all right you want me to hit
[2806.08 → 2811.44] this oh yeah let's do that, but we've got a bit of a scary merch update are we supposed to do merch messages
[2814.40 → 2820.40] sorry we'll get those after sponsors I think um okay let's do it Luke's going to do it today because
[2820.40 → 2826.64] my brain is bad yeah yeah yeah okay um ag1 starting with ag1 spring has arrived just like all the beautiful
[2826.64 → 2832.80] nature out there your body is thirsty for some nutrients so wake up with the bees and the trees with
[2832.80 → 2841.28] the scoop of ag1 uh it's an all-in-one supplement that has 75 different vitamins minerals and
[2841.28 → 2846.24] antioxidants their team is always trying to find better ways to source test and find the best quality
[2846.24 → 2851.52] ingredients available ag1 tests for hundreds of contaminants and banned substances which is much
[2851.52 → 2857.84] better than the supplement industry's average of 10. It really is easy as one it really is as easy as
[2857.84 → 2862.24] one scoop a day instead of purchasing all the different vitamins separately I'll say my own
[2862.24 → 2868.64] name Luke Dennis maria and a few members here a few other members here at leg have tried or even use ag1
[2868.64 → 2873.76] daily whether it's because they want to stop cutting corners after a diet change or uses a little boost

[3085.52 → 3090.24] weather to get better before going up the Coachella highway and going to check them out oh let's go
[3090.24 → 3095.36] I love their shorts that's great yeah that's how I think too yeah super cool yeah I didn't know they
[3095.36 → 3101.76] were from here originally and that's amazing yeah yep ah yeah I ended up deep diving a little bit after
[3101.76 → 3105.28] I found one of their shorts and then figured out they were from here which is pretty cool uh I think we need
[3105.28 → 3112.00] to do some announcements do we have uh is there store stuff or anything yes uh merch yeah yeah we do
[3112.00 → 3118.48] we have a date for the screwdriver bit set pricing increase oh good lord okay I warned you guys about
[3118.48 → 3124.88] this a little while ago, but there's not much more warning here they're going upstarting monday, April 29th
[3124.88 → 3129.84] so if you want to get some which is Monday sets they're going from 6.99 which apparently is not
[3129.84 → 3143.52] profitable so cool um to 9.99 which apparently is better um thank you CEO taken so make sure you
[3143.52 → 3148.56] get those at six dollars 99 cents while you can they're going to be going up on Monday April the 29th
[3149.28 → 3156.56] we also have restocks of some of our graphic tees including the neon hard drive sensor and retro GPU I have
[3156.56 → 3160.72] no way of screen sharing with you guys so you might just have to kind of imagine what those look like
[3160.72 → 3165.84] but if you want to send a merch message those might be some things you want to pick up I need a nap
[3165.84 → 3169.44] before I go to this party tonight though so I don't know if we're going to get to every merch message but
[3170.24 → 3175.04] oh yeah we'll, we'll definitely try and do a few luke week what is Luke week
[3176.80 → 3181.52] uh Luke week yeah we're doing uh something special on flow plane next week, and it's all about uh
[3181.52 → 3188.72] me I guess we will have a few me centric videos including the iconic chicken recipe no, no no, no
[3188.72 → 3193.28] no if we're going to have Luke week if we're going to have Luke week we need Linus week yeah and I hear i
[3193.28 → 3197.36] know I understand your argument every week is Linus week, and you know what that's fair but I think we
[3197.36 → 3203.28] can all agree there's no such thing as too much Linus week no i i think we I think we should
[3203.28 → 3210.48] is it actually no, no I'm totally kidding it's just funny that after all these years we have Luke week
[3211.04 → 3216.96] all you had to wait was uh ten and a half years on a platform that he's in charge of hey whoa, whoa
[3216.96 → 3222.88] whoa, whoa, so the whole idea was the inventor he was the inventor of Brandon appreciation day
[3222.88 → 3229.36] and it's taken him all these years to get his own appreciation week it's not it's not an appreciation
[3229.36 → 3234.64] week my goodness there's going to be other people as well it's not just me I didn't choose that it was me
[3234.64 → 3242.16] even started this um i I don't know i just I did your ego was gonna oh my goodness take off at some
[3242.16 → 3247.92] point i was asked and I just didn't say no took a lot you've got one chicken recipe okay you're not a god
[3251.76 → 3257.12] yeah, so there 's's a video tell us what you're doing there's a video where i I cook and talk about
[3257.12 → 3264.96] the chicken recipe and i get arty to try it um there's my thoughts on the gaming industry and a
[3264.96 → 3271.20] video of meeting my birds, so there are three videos coming, so your hall pass is arty
[3271.20 → 3280.32] uh yeah, so the whole like yeah that got a little weird don't worry about it because the chicken
[3280.32 → 3289.28] recipe it has a 100 success rate so i I thought about this and i think for it to be a success
[3289.28 → 3296.64] or a failure there has to be a goal applied so there was no goal applied with arty so I think we're fine
[3296.64 → 3305.04] I see okay yeah I think we're I think we're good um and then i guess we have a teaser here's
[3305.04 → 3312.56] a teaser of what to expect next week so Dan can you uh play audio from my screen uh yes if you want
[3312.56 → 3317.28] to go I'm there I'm not getting any audio from you oh it's not playing yet here we go there we go
[3317.84 → 3323.60] uh yeah approach the desk at the risk okay hold on hold on oh is it not working
[3323.60 → 3329.76] yeah there we go I approached the desk at the rental store with a freshly minted copy of the
[3329.76 → 3335.60] Elder Scrolls 3 Horwood after handing over my change and scurrying home I proceed to play for
[3335.60 → 3342.64] roughly 24 hours straight more captivated by this finely crafted world than anything I had seen in my
[3342.64 → 3349.76] entire 11 and a half years of life you got me even yeah wait is if it's just audio okay no
[3349.76 → 3358.32] no we're starting over all right I approached the desk at the rental store with a freshly minted copy
[3358.32 → 3364.48] of the Elder Scrolls 3 Horwood after handing over my change and scurrying home I proceed to play for
[3364.48 → 3371.52] roughly 24 hours straight more captivated by this finely crafted world than anything I had seen in my
[3371.52 → 3378.64] entire 11 and a half years of life even boobs I woke my dad up the next morning by professing my love
[3378.64 → 3385.12] of this game and begging him to buy a real copy of it to replace my rental version to my surprise he
[3385.12 → 3390.32] agreed my dad and I would take turns playing on a shared save file where one of us would read through
[3390.32 → 3395.92] the player's guide and direct the other who would control the character these are some of my favourite
[3395.92 → 3401.76] gaming memories ever we use that player's guide so much it barely holds together at this point the cover
[3401.76 → 3407.60] has been missing for decades I was driven to get into software development because I wanted to work for
[3407.60 → 3413.92] Bethesda fort odd Howard I wanted to make things like morning this piece of art that means so much
[3413.92 → 3420.56] to me to say this is my favourite game ever would be an understatement fast-forward 21 years to Starfield's
[3420.56 → 3427.28] release and I tried with every fibre of my being to find that diamond in the rough, but it just wasn't there
[3427.28 → 3436.32] okay uh I thought that was going to be a shorter clip um but essentially I long wow luke week is
[3436.32 → 3443.28] apparently takes an entire week yeah apparently yeah i uh so that's like uh it also changes significantly
[3443.28 → 3447.76] from there but I end up talking about how like yeah so Starfield sucked but I'm not going to go
[3447.76 → 3454.56] through all the details as to why um because it just that's been done to death already so here's my
[3454.56 → 3460.40] thoughts on like how the gaming industry is going why it's going that way different companies yada
[3461.28 → 3465.92] yeah hopefully it's interesting the people that have seen it so far liked it um like previous themed
[3465.92 → 3470.48] weeks we will be doing some LTT store giveaways that you can sign up for on float plane so if you
[3470.48 → 3474.80] want to see that content and get some potentially free stuff be sure to sign up and if you want to
[3474.80 → 3480.56] see what else float plane has if you're not on float plane for whatever reason we're also releasing the car
[3480.56 → 3489.04] break-in prank for 48 hours on leg clips, and it's live now did they know the show was starting at 1pm
[3489.84 → 3495.92] is it actually live now dude we've been driving a lot of uh subscriptions on float plane lately yeah
[3495.92 → 3502.88] it is live now it went up 35 minutes ago we're back pretty close to cracking 3500 there's apparently
[3502.88 → 3511.20] extras oh there's 500 for the Linus tries influencer drinks video now 35 000 sorry yeah I was just bugging
[3511.20 → 3519.20] you um yeah float plane's been rocking it lately uh yeah these sources have just been so sick talking a
[3519.20 → 3526.40] bit more about the humble pc uh that one oh nice two days ago yeah there's so much uh the 90 day
[3526.40 → 3531.20] scorpion chair challenge video is finally up that went up two days ago as well oh was it Elijah week
[3531.20 → 3536.56] there's like three Elijah exclusives in a row either that or the social team has just figured out that
[3536.56 → 3543.36] guy is solid meme gold anytime you point a camera at him yeah I don't think it actually was but I think it just uh
[3543.36 → 3550.24] you know became that anyway which is great uh but yeah check that out hopefully you guys enjoy it uh
[3550.24 → 3552.24] let us know how it goes and
[3553.36 → 3560.96] that's it oh Ltd forum folding update our team is once again participating in the brink pentathlon which runs from May 5th to
[3560.96 → 3567.28] to 19th we strongly encourage anyone interested to participate the Ltd team placed third overall
[3567.28 → 3573.20] last year which was easily our best so far participation is typically quite low since brink is
[3573.20 → 3579.20] a bit more complex than folding at home, but people are willing to help out if you want to learn so check
[3579.20 → 3586.40] out more information on the forum which I mean there's a there's a URL for it but if you just look up the
[3586.40 → 3593.92] Ltd forum and brink pentathlon 2024 uh a topic made by one of our very own moderators lead eater
[3593.92 → 3598.40] you will, you'll find it, and it'll be good, and you can do stuff yeah
[3605.28 → 3612.24] uh we can do merch all right what's our next topic yeah messages hello LDL have you heard about
[3612.24 → 3619.92] tram and what do you think it will do for pc and security due to its ability to retain the data when
[3619.92 → 3630.64] powered off uh returning the i I haven't actually particularly heard of this but retaining the data
[3630.64 → 3636.64] when powered off uh it could be potentially kind of bad there was tactics in the past where
[3636.64 → 3642.96] you would, I don't remember was it like was it like liquid nitrogen or something but you would
[3643.68 → 3649.44] cool ram down to very very very low temperatures and then swap what system was in, and then you could
[3649.44 → 3655.04] pull information out of it um that was a very interesting potentially terrible information like
[3655.04 → 3663.68] if there was an um in some cases plain text essentially storage of um critical system information
[3663.68 → 3670.56] or user input yeah yeah now is it super realistic for people to be able to get into a computer uh and
[3670.56 → 3676.00] like super freeze its ram and transfer it over to another computer uh you know I don't know um but it
[3676.00 → 3683.12] was a really cool thing um and if that is now able to be done without the uh difficulties of cooling and
[3683.12 → 3693.04] whatnot that could be a little sketch but yeah one sec here there we go sorry I don't have my double
[3693.04 → 3698.88] tabs I was in the middle of responding to another one hi LLD from France I want to buy a cap since
[3698.88 → 3704.08] the first announcement but I think the logo is too big how do you choose where to place a logo and
[3704.08 → 3712.64] have you considered a free ad version for a higher price I had free version we have pretty subtle logos on
[3712.64 → 3719.84] a lot of our stuff I think they just mean branding free um no, no no free ad like uh like giant logo
[3719.84 → 3727.68] for a higher price uh yeah maybe they do mean ad free yeah I think they mean ad free yeah pretty
[3727.68 → 3732.80] sure they mean that yeah okay sorry yeah I think they mean sponsorship stuff free uh or like uh branding
[3732.80 → 3738.48] free um I don't know I think honestly we generally strike a pretty good balance like even on the hat
[3738.48 → 3746.00] yeah the logo is pretty big, but it's like it's black it's black on black it doesn't stand out a ton and
[3746.00 → 3755.60] that's kind of a thing right is wearing a brand on your baseball cap i i I think the the the start
[3755.60 → 3760.24] of that product was actually people not really buying the dad hats and a lot of the feedback
[3760.24 → 3765.52] that we got being that they weren't obviously LTT enough so I think this is just one of those things
[3765.52 → 3769.84] where you're not going to be able to please everybody I really like the new hats it's possible
[3769.84 → 3774.64] that if they sell really well we will explore that fit in different styles but for now we're really
[3774.64 → 3782.96] focused on the regular LTT hat and the LTT hat pro yeah fair enough okay and last one for this section
[3782.96 → 3788.96] howdy guys curious your take on the EPA regulations causing automakers to make changes that may
[3788.96 → 3794.88] negatively impact reliability examples being Toyota's new direction with turbocharged engines
[3797.68 → 3798.08] man
[3798.08 → 3806.88] regulation is one of those things you can't really you can't live without it yeah uh I don't know the
[3806.88 → 3813.84] right answers here sometimes it's really obvious like you know hey you actually cannot discriminate
[3813.84 → 3821.52] against your customer as stupid as they look those broadband nutritional facts things in the states make a
[3821.52 → 3828.96] ton of sense given how predatory that industry has been in the past, but it's obvious that sometimes
[3828.96 → 3835.44] we end up with regulation that's up harming consumers rather than helping um man I was reading about
[3835.44 → 3840.64] another car one that was to do with all electric targets or something like that, and it was
[3840.64 → 3848.96] looking pretty ridiculous too to be clear I'm I'm I'm pro you know sustainable energy or whatever but just
[3848.96 → 3854.40] you know signing a law and saying okay go innovate um good luck everybody
[3856.96 → 3859.60] is not the move yeah
[3864.16 → 3869.52] yeah I don't think I have a lot to add there it just sucks like um planned obsolescence is a
[3869.52 → 3875.04] is a terrible thing um and making things like almost intentionally unreliable is bad but at the same time
[3875.04 → 3880.32] you don't you don't you don't want to stifle a company from being able to make like a bleeding
[3880.32 → 3884.96] edge version of something or an ultra-high performance version of something that that just
[3884.96 → 3891.12] has to lose some of its reliability in order to push those limits so I don't know
[3893.12 → 3900.32] I just became aware of a controversy apparently the edit of our Linus tries influencer foods
[3900.32 → 3908.48] um pushes pretty aggressively to the float plane exclusive where I try more of them um I haven't
[3908.48 → 3913.28] watched the video unfortunately I do review every LTT but I don't review every short circuit but people
[3913.28 → 3920.32] seem pretty upset um, and basically you know what I'm tired of just taking responsibility for everything
[3920.32 → 3927.28] I didn't see this so yeah i will message the appropriate people internally, and we'll try and find a
[3927.28 → 3934.08] better balance hopefully we can put this behind us is it that bad I haven't seen it have you actually
[3934.08 → 3942.24] watched it I'm not sure yeah okay all right uh this video was a 16-minute ad for float plane I don't know
[3942.24 → 3949.28] I like again I haven't watched it, but you also got 16 minutes of content yeah were you ripped off
[3949.28 → 3959.52] i I don't have this felt deceiving uh all right well yeah I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll take this to the people internally
[3959.52 → 3965.20] who made this call and uh you know we'll try and get this sorted out, but the thing is we are up you know we're
[3965.20 → 3970.88] not a big company, but we are a big enough company that believe it or not everyone knows absolutely
[3970.88 → 3978.08] everything that's going on all the time, and sometimes you know we're going to make a judgment call that's not going to be right I think it's pretty clear that the community has spoken
[3978.08 → 3983.44] the community has spoken, and they're saying this is not right this uh so we'll, you know we'll
[3984.08 → 3987.04] we'll do what we can, we'll get this fixed okay thanks guys
[3992.48 → 4000.40] uh no more merchant messages okay uh I'm going to stop with the rational explanations I want to be angry
[4000.40 → 4008.56] uh check out the escape from Markov Reddit there's lots of anger so much salt if you got is you got
[4008.56 → 4013.76] something I got a sodium deficiency yeah you got head straight there you're good you'll be taken care
[4013.76 → 4019.84] of entirely um Nintendo issues takedowns over Gary's mod content following community members noticing that
[4019.84 → 4026.48] Nintendo related fan content was being removed from Gary's mod Gary Newman has confirmed that face punch has
[4026.48 → 4032.08] received a takedown notice from Nintendo quote if you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo
[4032.08 → 4036.16] related uploads and never uploading again that would help us a lot
[4038.64 → 4044.88] tell us how you really feel Gary yeah uh there are almost 20 years worth of uploads for Gary's mod
[4044.88 → 4053.44] workshop including 5 500 items if you just search for the word Mario wow uh there were rumours that the
[4053.44 → 4058.40] notice was fake potentially caused by false copyright trolls but according to Gary face
[4058.40 → 4063.20] punch has confirmed the veracity of the notice with Nintendo and then there's a screenshot of a tweet
[4063.20 → 4069.28] saying uh I have been or an ex or whatever the heck I don't know uh I have been assured that the
[4069.28 → 4076.08] takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit, so this will now continue as planned sorry and then
[4076.08 → 4083.84] I don't even know the emojis that he included it's like a basketball or an arm or like a foot or
[4083.84 → 4088.88] something there's a garbage can and a mushroom so those those are like all right sounds good
[4088.88 → 4094.80] garbage can mushroom and then I don't know what the hell the thing is anyway um to be clear Nintendo is
[4094.80 → 4101.12] well within their rights here this is their intellectual property uh in this case the likeness
[4101.12 → 4106.08] you know of Mario is absolutely something that's within their rights it's sort of baffling to me
[4106.08 → 4112.00] that a gaming company managed to go 20 years without noticing Gary's mod um you know maybe
[4112.00 → 4116.80] that's part of what makes Nintendo different so they just what they don't look at other games they
[4116.80 → 4121.84] don't have no one who works there has a gaming computer like i just I don't know it seems to be
[4121.84 → 4125.76] working for them, it's working for them pretty good um and I can definitely see how this is really
[4125.76 → 4129.60] frustrating for people that are like yeah we kind of just thought this was okay it had been
[4130.40 → 4132.24] 20 years um
[4135.68 → 4139.36] our discussion question is should there be some kind of statute of limitations when it comes to
[4139.36 → 4143.60] brands not protecting their IP I believe there actually are but I don't think that that would
[4143.60 → 4149.44] be covered in this case, and it would all come down to the law of the various lands that are involved i
[4149.44 → 4155.60] think Gary is taking an extremely mature approach and the outraged gamers who are frustrated with
[4155.60 → 4161.28] Nintendo's action by all means be frustrated with Nintendo they are kind of jerk wads sometimes but
[4161.28 → 4169.52] this is within their rights and Gary is right to comply with them yeah all right speaking of things
[4169.52 → 4176.72] that uh have to do with right no it doesn't actually but anyway uh net neutrality is back FCC votes to
[4176.72 → 4183.60] restore Obama era rules repealed under trump FTC voted three to two to restore rules that prevent
[4183.60 → 4189.28] internet providers from favouring some sites and apps over others reserving high speeds for those willing
[4189.28 → 4196.24] to pay more for them or otherwise interfering with what consumers do online ahead of the vote FCC
[4196.24 → 4204.80] chairwoman Jessica rosenworcel hopefully I said that right uh stated in our post-pandemic world we know
[4204.80 → 4212.24] that broadband is a necessity not a luxury opponents claim it will chill innovation and investment in the
[4212.24 → 4218.08] broadband industry supporters argue that without such regulations broadband providers are incentivized to
[4218.08 → 4225.68] charge customers more to use internet fast lanes the full 400-page draft order has not yet been publicly
[4225.68 → 4236.00] released i i will say I don't think I heard of a ton of things happening as a result of the
[4236.00 → 4244.56] repeal of these rules um but I think I'm pretty happy that they might be coming back so yeah yeah this is
[4244.56 → 4249.52] great uh there's a few other really important ones that I want to make sure that we hit here like this
[4249.52 → 4254.64] is actually kind of a big week for news um ticktock this was we talked about this at the beginning
[4254.64 → 4260.24] congress says the U.S. congress has passed a law giving ticktock's parent company bite dance until January
[4260.24 → 4266.40] of next year to sell the app, or it will be blocked from U.S. app stores and internet service providers is this
[4266.40 → 4275.04] what it would take for iPhone users to finally say hey we need to be able to sideload is this what it
[4275.04 → 4282.40] would take to make the iPhone uncool with gen z's and gen alphas if you couldn't put ticktock on it
[4282.40 → 4287.36] because there's no way to sideload an app and ticktock isn't in the app store anyway this forced
[4287.36 → 4292.40] divestment was passed as part of a large foreign aid package targeted at Ukraine Israel and Taiwan
[4292.40 → 4297.36] bite dance has promised to fight the legislation in court calling it an unconstitutional infringement
[4297.36 → 4301.44] on American users free speech rights sources inside the company have told Reuters that bite
[4301.44 → 4307.04] dance leadership would rather ticktock shut down than sell it I honestly can kind of see that it's
[4307.04 → 4311.52] like this is my ball I'm gonna play with it or I'm going home or take it with me a major reason
[4311.52 → 4315.36] lawmakers gave for the decision to force bite dance to divest from ticktock is the lack of a barrier
[4315.36 → 4320.24] between the Chinese government and Chinese companies national security and privacy experts have expressed
[4320.24 → 4324.80] concern both that the app could be used to access sensitive user information and that its algorithm
[4324.80 → 4332.08] could be used to manipulate public opinion about the CCP I guess what I'm asking is why aren't you forcing
[4332.64 → 4340.48] Facebook to sell to who even I don't know or twitter to sell to who even I don't know like if
[4340.48 → 4347.12] basically your concern in a nutshell is that there's an entity controlling this app that you can't control
[4347.12 → 4353.76] and that could tune its algorithm for its own purposes I don't know man like I'm not I think
[4353.76 → 4359.76] that's exactly I think that is china that entity is specifically another country because I see where
[4359.76 → 4365.52] you're going and I do think you're entirely right but uh i I think they're like ooh this is
[4366.40 → 4372.32] uh what is it foreign national interference or whatever I don't remember the term for it but
[4372.32 → 4379.68] I think it's something that they're fighting against um who do you want to see by it is our discussion
[4379.68 → 4389.04] question in i I really can, I say the brackets can I say the brackets sure in brackets it says don't say Elon
[4389.04 → 4397.04] I mean if you hate ticktock maybe you would like to see I was going to say i kind of want it to be Elon
[4402.48 → 4410.72] oh man i just i I think the part of me that just like loves to see things sometimes burn just you know
[4410.72 → 4419.84] why not it is entertaining it's another thing that I don't like or use so like whatever I don't know
[4419.84 → 4424.96] speaking of government the state of California would like to know your location and also your
[4424.96 → 4431.76] velocity California senator Scott Weiner I'm sure it's I'm sure it's not pronounced quite like that
[4432.80 → 4438.88] initially proposed a bill that would place speed limiters in passenger vehicles to physically oh no
[4438.88 → 4443.04] no this was the thing I was talking about earlier okay yeah that would prevent them from going more
[4443.04 → 4450.48] than 10 miles an hour over the speed limit starting in 2027. Actually what however this has recently
[4450.48 → 4458.48] been revised to just using visual and audio signals to alert drivers of their speed Weiner also amended
[4458.48 → 4462.32] the bill to clarify that drivers would receive one warning each time they go over the speed threshold
[4462.32 → 4467.36] rather than a constant warning this version of the bill has passed the senate transportation
[4467.36 → 4472.72] committee along party lines the bill is backed by the national transportation safety board which has
[4472.72 → 4478.24] pushed for speed limiting systems since 2012 and the national highway traffic safety administration
[4478.24 → 4483.44] has documented a sharp increase in traffic fatalities nationwide including in major Californian cities
[4483.44 → 4487.52] it should be noted that these speed limit warning systems are not new and are actually set to be
[4487.52 → 4494.80] mandatory in all new vehicles in the EU starting in July man new cars are going to be on the struggle bus
[4494.80 → 4496.72] pretty quick styles here yeah
[4500.56 → 4502.64] because that's what I was sitting here thinking like it says
[4504.88 → 4509.20] would place speed limiters in passenger vehicles they mean just new ones right
[4510.40 → 4516.16] you don't have to like to retrofit your car to have a speed limiter in it yeah so I mean given that even
[4516.16 → 4520.56] seat belts you don't have to have them if your vehicle's old enough I doubt that we're going to see speed
[4520.56 → 4526.72] limiters retroactively fit into cars but yeah who knows right so in this case then the used car market
[4527.36 → 4532.64] is just going to be so like you're going to have used cars from other states being shipped to California
[4532.64 → 4540.32] because people don't want to buy older used cars um or I wonder if it's is you could even get just any
[4540.32 → 4547.44] new car but from out of state like our car dealerships along the outside but along the Californian
[4547.44 → 4553.36] border are going to be like super popular because you can get non-California uh law compliant cars
[4553.36 → 4559.04] and then like just you know bring them into California I don't know I don't know how those laws would
[4559.04 → 4568.96] work I don't know American stuff but yeah EK has given a statement on uh the allegations that they
[4568.96 → 4575.20] failed to pay suppliers employees and contractors for multiple months uh CEO and founder Edward Koenig has
[4575.20 → 4579.92] released a statement apologizing both for the hardship caused by lack of timely payment and lack
[4579.92 → 4586.32] of adequate communication he took over as CEO in February and claims to have already addressed several
[4586.32 → 4591.84] issues but acknowledged there's still a long way to go you know what's funny is this is round two of
[4591.84 → 4601.60] this did you know that no yeah Edward stepped down as CEO once like 10 or 12 years ago I can't remember
[4601.60 → 4608.80] exactly when EK basically went to crap, and then he stepped back in and restored it to its former glory
[4608.80 → 4616.56] and better and then I didn't even know that he was out again, but it seems like something about EK water
[4616.56 → 4625.04] blocks runs best when Edward Koenig Mr EK is at the helm um Koenig claims that EK is committed to
[4625.04 → 4629.60] fulfilling its financial obligations and regaining community trust I mean our discussion question here
[4629.60 → 4634.16] is a huge one uh why did it take so long to communicate the new plan like that's something
[4634.16 → 4639.76] that he doesn't have an excuse for because if he's been CEO for two months um that would have been the
[4639.76 → 4647.76] time to communicate better um like we said in the video that featured a bunch of EK parts though we are
[4648.32 → 4654.80] we are hopeful that they will get themselves out of this um because you know what I love the product
[4654.80 → 4662.32] it's a great product and i I want to see them succeed, but obviously that success can't come at
[4662.32 → 4669.92] the cost of their employees and their contractors right it can't come on their backs so good luck
[4670.56 → 4676.64] good lucky k Godspeed yeah what else we got uh I don't really care about that one
[4676.64 → 4688.48] is it the Cybertruck one nope it's the born jams tattoo one yeah okay where is this is
[4688.48 → 4694.32] pretty cool their naming conventions for their new chips are really stupid oh yeah actually
[4694.88 → 4701.52] snapdragon x elite but like with less clocker less clockers yeah, so the name is but with
[4701.52 → 4706.96] what but what is even the difference for this one what am I even looking at here
[4707.84 → 4712.80] it just has a different part number it doesn't do dual-core boost i think there's no dual
[4712.80 → 4717.84] core boost why is oh that's right and then why does why is plus less
[4722.00 → 4727.76] Qualcomm has said that gaming on these chips will just work with the x series of SOCS no porting
[4727.76 → 4732.72] required and this was apparently achieved through a Rosetta 2 style translation layer it seems they're
[4732.72 → 4738.08] positioning these chips to be an alternative to AMD's mobile radios and in mobile dozens and intel's
[4738.08 → 4742.32] ultra lineup they've been showing off their snapdragon x elite primarily laptops and claim it can work with
[4742.32 → 4751.44] discrete GPUs okay that's pretty cool so have been having the ability to like to put an NVIDIA GPU on this thing
[4751.44 → 4756.96] and just use it as a CPU is kind of it just kind of blows my mind I don't know why um semiaccurate.com
[4756.96 → 4762.40] talked with unnamed OEMS that claim the Qualcomm benchmarks are faked though up to 50 higher than
[4762.40 → 4767.20] what the OEMS can reproduce with the same x plus chip Qualcomm has claimed that the weaker x plus can
[4767.20 → 4773.52] deliver 28 better 28 better performance in cine bench 2024 than intel's ultra 7 155h at the same power
[4773.52 → 4778.16] consumption, and it looks like there's a few more notes here but what this is going to boil down to is
[4778.80 → 4784.24] show me the money let's see let's see what you guys have actually got going on here enough talk
[4785.04 → 4789.68] I'm pretty excited to check these out though this could be the Apple Silicon moment for windows
[4789.68 → 4796.64] pcs I wouldn't mind better battery life that would be okay yeah we could use it um who
[4796.64 → 4803.60] thought naming four products only two different names was cool i I don't mind the plus that much
[4804.16 → 4810.24] um I think the problem that makes it weird is the placing that it has in this chart because elite
[4810.24 → 4814.64] sounds better than plus so if plus was just first and then elite came after it would be fine
[4816.40 → 4823.20] yeah exactly I guess what's just snapdragon x plus what yeah yeah, but there isn't one of those
[4823.20 → 4828.88] yeah that's fair three of them just being called snapdragon x elite is like definitely the whole problem
[4828.88 → 4840.88] uh oh well um okay anything else do do do cyber truck thing uh the high school principal thing
[4843.92 → 4847.92] I'm going to do the high school principal thing for the people playing bingo um high school
[4847.92 → 4853.60] principal almost messages never okay mind oh yeah sure let's do it let's do a couple merge messages
[4853.60 → 4858.64] sure I might have to go pretty soon boys you can carry on a little longer without me but I am fading
[4858.64 → 4867.04] extremely fast here yeah yes I only got warning sorry i I didn't sleep last night at all and I got on
[4867.04 → 4873.04] a plane at 8 a.m so I had to be I had to leave for the airport at five so basically I stayed up working
[4873.04 → 4882.24] on a paint job uh until about 4 30. I got a little bit of rest not sleep just rest while I packed and then
[4882.24 → 4890.40] I headed out for the airport at around 5 30 and then i uh and then I ate and then I flew and I got
[4890.40 → 4894.16] a little bit of sleep on the plane but I'm dying, but you know what I don't know whether it's the lack
[4894.16 → 4899.20] of sleep or whether it's the paint fumes I'm feeling pretty silly today but it was worth it I just got
[4899.20 → 4902.88] um I got a message from Alex that says
[4902.88 → 4909.92] honestly paint job is pretty sick
[4911.12 → 4916.80] it's terrible so I just want to get that out there right now it's terrible but that's the intention
[4917.44 → 4924.08] um you guys might remember that in that we upgraded plates car video we alluded to potentially a part
[4924.08 → 4930.08] two well what we came up with is that we were going to do a part two adding more tech to his car so we
[4930.08 → 4935.04] added android auto we ended up added a backup camera last time and we had teased maybe doing
[4935.04 → 4941.68] power windows power door locks uh you know putting in some new headlights but like we can't have
[4941.68 → 4946.08] everyone internally complaining that we're upgrading plates car and nobody else's so there had to be a
[4946.08 → 4956.32] catch and the catch is that I got to paint his car any colour I wanted I'm very excited oh man
[4956.32 → 4963.28] I'm going to see this okay sorry Dan go ahead sure let's get through some merch messages here for
[4963.28 → 4969.04] the curated right now hi DLL first time watching live at 42 just found out that I'm expecting my
[4969.04 → 4975.76] first child while you had your family young do you have any advice for someone having their first in
[4975.76 → 4989.12] their 40s oh man well having not tried it um yet knock on wood um I don't know yeah yeah yeah or not
[4989.12 → 4999.04] ideally i uh yo um having not tried it I mean I would say the biggest thing that has kept me
[4999.92 → 5005.76] more aligned with my kids is being into tech actually like I introduced my kids to discord
[5005.76 → 5011.92] which they use to socialize with their friends don't let your kids you know move on to you know
[5011.92 → 5017.36] Instagram or move on to the move on to the platform and then follow them around because that makes you
[5017.36 → 5022.64] not cool and everything about it not cool but if you just kind of are staying with it a little bit
[5022.64 → 5027.68] and you have some idea what's going on don't underestimate the importance of knowing what the heck they're
[5027.68 → 5033.44] talking about um and yeah some of it's going to be kind of stupid my kids like stupid movies and
[5033.44 → 5039.20] stupid videos and stupid games they talk man my kids just got into Fortnite anyway yeah this made me
[5039.20 → 5043.52] the point is you're not always gonna you're not always going to enjoy it but think of it as work
[5044.08 → 5052.00] little man has such good taste in games forever I know ah my soul
[5052.00 → 5060.16] okay that's fine you know what I haven't shown him uh I haven't shown him warcraft 3 yet and I think
[5060.16 → 5066.24] that's going to capture his attention so I'm so I'm going to step up my plan he is a RTS gamer he
[5066.24 → 5075.68] totally is oh he's a good sing for RTS yeah yep he's got the brain loves Anna um yeah love supreme commander
[5075.68 → 5080.80] so yeah I'm gonna I'm going to have him play the warcraft 3 campaign that's uh that's some good one
[5080.80 → 5088.56] right there it's a perfect one get him on factor maybe not yet, but he'll, he'll, I'm sure
[5088.56 → 5093.84] he'll like that he won't go to school and I'd like to see it once in a while yeah yeah yeah
[5095.52 → 5103.92] he's probably a bit better with sleep strategy than you uh sorry hi DLL how have you managed to keep a
[5103.92 → 5110.00] good level of structure and tidiness in your test or lab uh places with a growing team working for a
[5110.00 → 5116.32] company that struggles establishing good practices while growing I think we struggle with that too
[5120.00 → 5125.44] same yeah but yeah I did yeah a high deal I think you're going to continue sorry yeah
[5126.72 → 5134.24] do we no ideal I started a job as the okay hold on we deserve a little bit more credit than
[5134.24 → 5140.72] that um we started by having a pretty big space for them so they were able to spread things out a
[5140.72 → 5147.12] little bit um they actually do a pretty darn good job of um assigning a place for everything
[5147.76 → 5152.08] uh we don't always have everything in its place but overall we have a place for everything so it keeps
[5152.08 → 5158.24] things from getting too messy um, and we're trying not to rush them, and they've had a forward-thinking plan
[5158.24 → 5163.76] the whole time yeah there was like uh essentially models of where they were going to
[5163.76 → 5172.96] put things from like the very beginning yeah okay go ahead Dan right oh one moment
[5173.84 → 5180.64] ideal I started a job as it guy for a company not much before was documented I want to document all
[5180.64 → 5186.56] the processes but would doing that make me replaceable how can I make myself indispensable
[5188.32 → 5193.52] have good ideas like documenting all your processes and execute it and totally kick butt at it and then
[5193.52 → 5198.40] have a new good idea and then do that and then all of a sudden not only will you not be replaceable
[5198.40 → 5207.76] you'll be indispensable there I had to point this way not be yeah the importance of initiative and uh
[5207.76 → 5213.28] making the company work better regardless of whether it's directly on your you know quarterly KPIs
[5213.28 → 5218.40] the importance can't be overstated yeah and like if people are really paying attention and you're
[5218.40 → 5224.48] just not documenting things as an person uh you will be very suddenly extremely replaceable
[5226.24 → 5233.84] yeah so and as somebody who was irreplaceable for about seven years you want to be replaceable
[5233.84 → 5239.68] I took four days off in those seven years yeah that too I need to take a Friday off when I'm here
[5240.48 → 5247.28] we have to you we have to take the context here the context was they are making themselves replaceable
[5248.40 → 5253.76] by making their job function really really really smooth so it was a very different thing that I was
[5253.76 → 5258.00] talking about constant innovation is not the same thing as being the only guy who knows how to do it and
[5258.00 → 5262.48] so you just get called in the middle of the night by the owner or whatever yes exactly, and he did
[5262.48 → 5268.72] technically end it with or whoever this was um did technically end it with how can I make myself
[5268.72 → 5274.48] indispensable so I think Linus's answer was like pretty good yeah yeah um you want to be
[5274.48 → 5285.04] indispensable and yeah exactly yeah uh evening l LD caught a merch message in a march when about screen
[5285.04 → 5290.96] time for kids and thought Linus put out a lot of good info curious Linus what is the standard bedtime in
[5290.96 → 5298.16] your house for the kids' oh man you have to understand I got three kids we were all over that stuff like
[5298.16 → 5305.76] you know bedtime routine we brushed all the kids teeth by hand ourselves and like always did stories and it
[5305.76 → 5311.92] was always at kind of the same time these days it's like I don't know are you tired I'm tired okay kids go
[5311.92 → 5320.32] to bed um you eventually kind of relax on that stuff uh generally speaking one of my kids is a
[5320.32 → 5325.92] total night owl my eldest daughter um so I can put her to bed, and you know at 8 30, and she'll still be
[5325.92 → 5330.40] awake in her bed just lying there staring at the ceiling at 10 30 anyway so what's the point um
[5330.96 → 5335.20] I'll so I'll send her to bed if she's like cranky and obviously needs to sleep but other than that she's um
[5335.20 → 5341.44] she kind of sleeps when she's tired and then the youngest one we try to get her in bed at you know 8 30
[5341.44 → 5348.64] and uh screen time does end once bedtime starts um however I mean my problem as a kid was never screens when I was
[5348.64 → 5353.68] supposed to be sleeping it was always books, and we do let our kids read in bed so sometimes they're tired and
[5353.68 → 5361.20] they're hard to wake up in the morning but honestly if I can raise a house of readers I consider a little bit of lost sleep to be uh acceptable collateral damage
[5361.20 → 5368.40] fair okay last of the curative I've got for you here with how bad the car industry is getting what do you think
[5368.40 → 5375.52] of a reality involving an open source car I know we both believe the vast majority will not own their own
[5375.52 → 5383.12] cars in the future don't those exist cars aren't there cars that are effectively open source
[5384.88 → 5391.04] so much of making a car is not the car so much of it is the infrastructure to produce the car
[5391.04 → 5397.20] like look how many car companies there are that can make one car or a dozen cars the problem is that
[5397.20 → 5401.52] the overhead involved in designing and building a car and setting up for manufacture means that you have
[5401.52 → 5405.44] to make thousands and thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of cars, or it doesn't make
[5405.44 → 5410.80] any financial sense so I don't think that the traditional model of car manufacture is going anywhere
[5410.80 → 5416.48] anytime soon but who knows hey framework raised another what like 16 million dollars maybe that's their
[5416.48 → 5422.40] next big uh expansion probably not i actually oh I had meant to kind of speculate on that but I think
[5422.40 → 5426.56] i actually just need to go and lie down for a little bit before this event I'm supposed to attend
[5427.28 → 5431.92] yeah do it get here maybe next week why don't next week why don't we uh why don't we play a guessing
[5431.92 → 5438.48] game and see what frameworks next um next investment cycle is going to go into number one was framework 13
[5438.48 → 5443.20] number two was framework 16 number three is something, and they're saying it's going to be quite different
[5443.20 → 5450.16] yeah not a laptop um just investment disclosure yeah yeah all right I think it's not a laptop I need
[5450.16 → 5455.60] to go you guys can hang out a bit longer if you want but I really need to go okay bye thanks for tuning in
[5455.60 → 5462.64] see you again next week same bad time same bad channel um I can't say my thing because I'm not leaving but bye Linus
[5463.60 → 5471.36] um okay yeah high school principal almost framed for fake racist rant using AI a clip was posted to a
[5471.36 → 5476.56] popular Instagram account with the voice of Baltimore County Pikesville high school's principal
[5476.56 → 5483.84] making racist remarks targeting teachers students and parents by name these included one threat to drag
[5483.84 → 5488.96] the school's athletic directors uh wow um actually not going to say that
[5492.08 → 5499.04] but it was bad, and the clip is still up apparently uh it was convincing enough that it began to spread
[5499.04 → 5504.88] immediately um Emily why says if you don't want to hear it there are a couple of points where it sounds
[5505.60 → 5509.20] off, and it's easy to gloss over them because the rest sounds so natural
[5513.20 → 5519.12] yeah that's rough this stuff is getting crazy students uh faculty and the community believed the clip
[5519.12 → 5525.52] and really and this led to the principal being temporarily removed, and an investigation launched the
[5525.52 → 5530.24] investigation revealed that it was in fact a fake made by the schools made by the school's athletic
[5530.24 → 5539.36] director what a twist it's good I love this story it's terrifying that's wild so the athletic director
[5540.48 → 5548.40] made an AI clip of the principal very negatively calling out the athletic director um
[5548.40 → 5558.40] that's rough um the investigation revealed that yeah the smoking gun was that he had used the school
[5558.40 → 5564.96] computers and his school email to sign up for the AI voice imitation service and distribute the fake
[5564.96 → 5574.72] recordings okay forensic analysis points to a service like 11 labs which can synthesize voices with just a few
[5574.72 → 5582.08] minutes of audio uh only the principal's union leader suggested that the clip may be a deep fake one person
[5584.64 → 5590.96] how can we be sure of anything we see or hear anymore is there any coming back from this uh in my opinion
[5592.16 → 5599.20] not really to be completely honest um we're in like post truth or whatever
[5599.20 → 5604.32] I'm not getting in the chair this is Luke's show you could
[5610.80 → 5618.08] that was an of I don't want to I don't care uh that's like an is that okay i I feel bad about that
[5618.08 → 5622.00] why do you feel bad about it, I don't know because this is your in Linus's show I'm just here to
[5622.00 → 5624.80] do merch messages yeah, but we used to have guests on the show all the time
[5624.80 → 5631.20] I think Elijah was even like hey can I join and I was like I mean if jams says it okay but i also
[5631.20 → 5636.64] don't know how long we're doing this show for yeah should be a little while longer I guess a little bit
[5636.64 → 5644.08] yeah uh I think we have some other topics the cyber trunk may be bulletproof, but it's not
[5644.08 → 5650.56] waterproof here comes Dan here comes Dan we're switching can't wait I can't do it
[5653.28 → 5659.92] oh I don't know how to do there he is yeah I don't actually normally do camera switching
[5659.92 → 5670.56] you have to do both jobs so he has to it's like I'll just remote into if it's fine it'll be fine
[5672.08 → 5677.92] I can do it from home I can do it from over by Linus's place oh that's funny uh there we go the
[5677.92 → 5684.00] cyber truck may be bulletproof, but it's not waterproof uh car wash woes turns out that the bullet
[5684.00 → 5688.88] resistant truck is not able to handle a bit of water the terms and conditions of the cyber truck say
[5688.88 → 5695.20] that if you fail to put it into car wash mode your new eighty thousand dollar truck can be rendered a
[5695.20 → 5706.40] paperweight ticktock user uh cap than caption dot ad went to uh went to the beach with his dogs
[5706.40 → 5712.24] and then he didn't even pressure wash it but rinsed it out uh rinsed out the bed with a hose and now his
[5712.24 → 5718.56] infotainment screen is completely non-functional whoa uh this includes the truck's speedometer
[5718.56 → 5724.88] oh okay uh charging information and rear camera which is necessary to back up the vehicle
[5724.88 → 5729.36] because the back window is otherwise too narrow and often obscured by the truck's bed cover
[5729.36 → 5734.80] several other users have reported problems with corrosion in part because stainless steel is not
[5734.80 → 5740.88] rustproof merely rust resistant uh all the cyber trucks were apparently recalled every cyber truck has
[5740.88 → 5746.72] been recalled due to a fault with the accelerator pedal uh recall here means that tesla will be replacing
[5746.72 → 5752.32] the faulty parts not like slip off right yeah I think at least part of it will slip off and get
[5752.32 → 5757.92] stuck, and it gets stuck so I've seen that it forces the accelerator down there is the brake overrides
[5757.92 → 5762.40] because they're all digital the brake overrides the accelerator cool so if you would press the brake
[5763.12 → 5766.80] it wouldn't matter that the accelerator was down because you would just brake but I mean how long would
[5766.80 → 5772.64] it takes you to realize that you're not pushing down and how and are you actually going and that
[5772.64 → 5777.36] controls no that that would override it you can't really put it into neutral, and you can't like
[5778.32 → 5782.16] turn the engine off a lot of the tricks you would do in a gas car are not going to work just right into
[5782.16 → 5786.88] a wall and a trick that you wouldn't really necessarily do in a gas car does work so it's like
[5786.88 → 5797.20] like yeah yeah it's terrifying not, not good um should I use more hot glue maybe uh oh yeah here
[5797.20 → 5801.76] we go here's the detail specifically it is possible for the accelerator pedal to slide up while flooring
[5801.76 → 5805.84] it lodging the pedal cover against some trim and causing the pedal to get stuck all the way down
[5806.48 → 5812.80] rough it seems like a problem was caused by an unapproved change oh yeah sure we've experienced one of
[5812.80 → 5819.28] those little backpack okay I take it back yeah this happens all the time it was caused by an unapproved
[5819.28 → 5826.00] change to the assembly of the pedal and introduced a lubricant some soap to help the cover slide on
[5826.00 → 5833.44] but I guess that stayed there uh the recall also revealed that tesla has only delivered 3 878 cyber trucks
[5833.44 → 5839.20] oh my gosh so how much does the cyber truck cost it's like a hell of a lot of money isn't it
[5839.20 → 5845.76] people are saying the brakes are physical still um the non-fly-by-wire brakes but the I don't think
[5845.76 → 5850.08] they've figured that out perfectly yet but the accelerator is I mean my car has a
[5850.08 → 5855.28] fly-by-wire accelerator because yeah you know a lot of automatics will have the automatic cut and blip and
[5855.28 → 5862.64] things like that right um I mean why would they this is like a hundred thousand dollar truck or something
[5862.64 → 5868.40] like that flagship product I think so why are they just like gluing on or slipping over a cover why isn't it
[5868.40 → 5875.76] like milled aluminum, or you know there's a screw in it like one screw right at the bottom one single
[5875.76 → 5881.04] screw like you know this is just, just one right there, and then it wouldn't fall off like come on
[5881.04 → 5888.00] i I was seeing people do like uh I don't want to deal with the recall yet but I need to drive my truck a
[5888.00 → 5893.52] little bit what does my fix just take it off some of those were pretty funny yeah you just take the
[5893.52 → 5898.48] cover off you can screw it on yourself you can do there's like somebody like screw just right through
[5898.48 → 5904.00] it yeah what's it going to hurt the resale value it's been in the air for like a week it's already rusted
[5905.04 → 5909.20] you've had to clean it six you're not going to get your money back on like the rags and the cleaning
[5909.20 → 5916.88] fluid for yeah yeah yeah I don't know yeah I can't, I can't get uh tesla's website to play nice right now
[5916.88 → 5923.28] um it's just forcing me to select a language yeah yeah what if i actually just pick one okay now it's
[5923.28 → 5932.48] working that's weird um a rivet that's a good idea job one rivet do you know the price of rivets
[5932.48 → 5935.28] like practically nothing I think they're like four dollars a ton
[5937.28 → 5941.44] or actually uh what about that uh microwave welding thing where you just like
[5942.16 → 5948.48] squish it and then oh yeah, yeah like I think even the stream deck is made with that stream deck can
[5948.48 → 5955.52] do it why can't tesla I bet they make a good car pedal I don't know i wonder how good it
[5955.52 → 5960.64] was before they did the soap thing because it was an unapproved change that they're blaming it on but
[5960.64 → 5966.56] there wasn't a fastener yeah I'm not sure maybe it is like clipped on I mean you could have a pretty
[5966.56 → 5973.12] strong interference fit with like rubbers or metals or things like that uh but why would it need soap
[5974.00 → 5979.28] like are they putting them on by hand yeah I'm not sure what the manufacturing process was but it
[5979.28 → 5983.60] was a lubricant to put it on yeah you would normally well why isn't that lubricant glue
[5987.20 → 5994.64] glue and slippy a little bit of superglue nice uh nice smooth stuff just yeah, yeah bloody hell whatever
[5994.64 → 5999.44] obviously they would buy it in higher quantities with bigger discounts but a 50 pack of rivets from
[5999.44 → 6005.76] Home Depot is nine bucks Canadian stainless steel I think so it was along with the build
[6006.48 → 6009.36] goes along with the build to wash your pedal after every time you accelerate
[6010.56 → 6013.68] but careful don't wash it with too much water because you might short out your whole truck
[6015.36 → 6022.08] put it in car wash mode first i was promised utopia I don't like current year I don't think I have
[6022.08 → 6030.24] for a while just make good things don't make bad things uh I think we had a discussion question
[6030.24 → 6034.32] did we even talk about it what kind of process results in a truck that isn't even weatherproof
[6037.52 → 6047.76] yeah I don't know man the um ego is it ego is it I'm happy with like what tesla did by existing
[6047.76 → 6051.68] just like get more interest in EVS yeah um
[6054.32 → 6059.68] but like this ain't it I mean to me on paper stainless steel car cool
[6060.64 → 6068.32] DeLorean yeah you clean it with gasoline that's the best way to clean the DeLorean is gasoline
[6068.32 → 6071.68] I didn't know that yeah it cleans stainless steel perfect
[6071.68 → 6079.28] which I think is hilarious because we don't do that anymore, and it's an electric car
[6080.32 → 6085.60] and gas is like what three four dollars a gallon now nearly three dollars a litter here
[6086.08 → 6092.16] it's about two pound a litter in the America that is over on the other side of the pond like
[6092.16 → 6100.40] I don't know it's crazy uh apparently this is I don't know if this doesn't seem like an actual
[6100.40 → 6107.44] official video oh yeah white diesel that makes sense but uh here's their fix I thought this was a
[6107.44 → 6112.00] do-it-yourself version of the fix because I've seen this video I didn't think this was tesla's fix
[6112.00 → 6117.28] yeah I mean just literally that so they I think this was so when I saw the one that was claiming
[6117.28 → 6121.84] this was a DIY fix people are saying no it's official okay I don't know uh, but this looks
[6121.84 → 6127.84] like just like a 3d printed block that ensures that you line it up properly and then uh I think
[6127.84 → 6133.28] they're drilling a hole and then just riveting the hole I think is the whole thing we'll see here in a
[6133.28 → 6143.92] moment so it's coming back yeah drilling a hole in it wait for it wait for it there we go there it is
[6143.92 → 6154.24] looks like a rivet to me, I'm not a fan of rivets they're not serviceable yeah yeah me too
[6155.52 → 6161.52] I'm going to have to drill that out right to repair I mean you could drill it out though yeah
[6162.40 → 6169.60] but I just put a Robertson in there uh an open future is on the horizon get it because that's the
[6169.60 → 6176.32] name of the operating system uh meta is opening its quest VR headset software now called horizon OS
[6176.32 → 6182.88] to third-party devices meta has already uh included three official partners planning to
[6183.52 → 6189.28] planning on creating horizon OS based headsets including a gaming focused device from Asus
[6189.28 → 6195.44] a learning focused device from Lenovo and a limited edition meta quest in collaboration with Xbox
[6195.44 → 6201.60] meta apparently wants it sos to become the android of virtual reality a major benefit for users is
[6201.60 → 6207.44] the ability to bring profile information across devices and device manufacturers and cross device
[6207.44 → 6214.16] compatible programs and games Adam thinks a major downside for users is the ability for meta to track
[6214.16 → 6220.56] even more of you uh which is I'm sure 100 of the reason why they want to do this yeah that seems like
[6220.56 → 6226.64] the reason anybody does anything these days' oh we released this new pair of software it's open and free
[6228.72 → 6235.12] we get all the information uh discussion question would a default platform shared between various
[6235.12 → 6242.16] headsets be a boon to VR do we trust Zuckerberg to be the man with the plan uh what's in it for mark
[6242.16 → 6248.08] after the mediocre launch of the vision pro is meta feeling bullish or bearish on the VR market as a whole
[6248.08 → 6255.12] what about you a lot of questions actually that is a lot of questions I'm a computer tethered guy
[6255.12 → 6261.92] yeah my headset's a screen one of the reasons I switched to the index over the uh I still call
[6261.92 → 6268.80] it the cv1 because I was a dk1 boy been there from the start yeah get in there for the dev stuff yeah
[6269.28 → 6273.92] is because the lighthouse system is a little bit more open to third-party trackers and like
[6273.92 → 6280.24] tracking and things like that than maybe a closed system or even inside out right um but I mean i
[6280.24 → 6288.56] would like to see the software at least being a little more open um I don't even see why the headsets
[6288.56 → 6294.64] couldn't just be like tethered headsets, but you would attach a computer module to the headset so you
[6294.64 → 6301.52] kind of have like headset driving companies and then maybe also headset display companies right like the
[6301.52 → 6307.36] index had a plug on the top and I could just pop an oculus android phone yeah so it's really turning
[6307.36 → 6313.60] into like computer and monitor yeah instead of all in one device yeah yeah I like the idea of like a
[6313.60 → 6318.88] someone putting a sticker on their headset that's like my other VR headset is a computer
[6318.88 → 6324.32] monitor yeah yeah I mean that makes sense yeah a lot of the good stuff uh yeah I think
[6324.32 → 6332.08] the shared between i think they're bearish right and I think it seems like it, I think a lot
[6332.08 → 6337.60] of people maybe have been moving away from games because developing games for VR is really hard it's
[6337.60 → 6344.32] a very limited platform you don't really have too much that you can do uh in the space and then
[6344.32 → 6350.64] productivity like is that better uh you know I've got this here my head is unencumbered apart from some
[6350.64 → 6358.32] headphones and I do know people all the people that I know that kept their apple vision pros uh
[6358.32 → 6363.60] and especially the people that I know that is happy with them are people that travel a lot and
[6363.60 → 6370.64] work while they travel I think that's reasonable and travel might even be it's a very expensive
[6370.64 → 6378.08] productivity tool what are your productivity gains versus um the amount that you've spent on it
[6378.08 → 6385.68] like are you making x amount of dollars more than you would or is it for fun or is it for writing like
[6388.00 → 6395.12] I don't know I think there's got to be a little bit of tech passion involved um but I think you've got
[6395.12 → 6402.48] the if you've got the tech passion, and you can excuse it as like a productivity for work slash business expense
[6402.48 → 6407.92] I think those you want to sell it to yourself yeah I guess yeah yeah i can certainly see that i
[6407.92 → 6412.40] think if I had the disposable income and needed that use case then you know maybe I would buy it i
[6412.40 → 6419.52] still haven't gotten to try it um it seems to have disappeared but I don't know just spatial computing is a
[6420.40 → 6426.72] a concept I'm not sure if it's an interesting one uh Avery studio says are they using it while in the
[6426.72 → 6431.76] middle of travelling yeah totally yeah you can sit on a plane right on a plane passenger seat in
[6431.76 → 6437.84] a car something like that train yeah in an automobile yeah um people are definitely using them i just i
[6437.84 → 6444.08] think it's a lot less common than obviously when it first came out um maybe it's kind of settled into
[6444.08 → 6450.96] its like 600 more hardcore users who are actually going to get some use out of it yeah maybe getting
[6450.96 → 6456.00] it and seeing that it's a toy unless you actually really want to use it like a super powerful
[6456.00 → 6465.04] computer is a good toy a four thousand five thousand dollar computer to play games on very expensive
[6465.04 → 6473.44] toy right yes yeah as a productivity tool also pretty expensive you could maybe be reasonably productive
[6473.44 → 6479.76] on a laptop, but it's better to be productive on a desktop, so maybe that's the kind of comparison and
[6479.76 → 6486.00] there are also some privacy benefits absolutely uh if you're on a plane um, and you're not in like
[6486.00 → 6490.96] first class because you didn't feel like uh remortgaging your house to fly somewhere you could
[6490.96 → 6496.00] have bought two vision pros yeah exactly uh then, then other people might be able to see your screen
[6496.00 → 6499.68] and depending on what you're working on that might actually not be okay you might want to protect your
[6499.68 → 6505.44] slash fiction you know yeah all that sort of stuff totally nobody wants to see your weird Harry Potter
[6505.44 → 6512.88] stuff i have to buy a vision pro you know that kind of thing yeah if it helps the productivity of
[6515.12 → 6522.56] of uh of that then yeah why not um how about a bike I don't know man I don't think you can take those
[6522.56 → 6530.80] on planes I think they meant using it while you're on a bike uh I think maybe if it's a tandem bike and
[6530.80 → 6536.08] you're in the back you could make it work I think what it's 12 milliseconds of delay something like
[6536.08 → 6541.76] that I'm sure you could find a way to bike around maybe once the for gets better yeah I'm waiting for
[6541.76 → 6549.28] glasses for me super high quality AR glasses we're not there yet but yeah that's where I'm okay with
[6549.28 → 6555.44] like all right now I'm going to consider glasses being a productivity tool right my biggest thing right
[6555.44 → 6562.72] now is it's its something that's going to go in your face so if you want wide market adoption it
[6562.72 → 6574.00] needs to not be hideous I think for me, I like the uh like the solidary the solidity of physical
[6574.00 → 6579.52] objects right um when I'm being productive or I'm working on stuff the last thing I want to be
[6579.52 → 6588.40] uh separating my brain into is the management of my environment right so I'm working on things and
[6588.40 → 6592.88] then suddenly there's a window here but I need it over here or something like that with a mouse it's
[6592.88 → 6599.20] really easy to just book but now kind of I'm dealing with floating windows, and they have to be in 3d
[6599.20 → 6605.92] space and I have to manipulate them and now I'm trying to conceptualize where my productivity is going
[6605.92 → 6612.64] and maybe you would get used to that, so this is kind of it's very new um you know I can do that
[6612.64 → 6617.12] on a computer maybe less experienced users struggle with that right I have no idea if this is a thing
[6617.12 → 6621.36] or not so I might be talking about a thing that already exists but something that you might like
[6621.36 → 6627.92] is if someone made an app where you could set up like a workspace, and you could have multiple workspaces
[6627.92 → 6632.48] and then the things within that workspace are contained to that like plane you know what I haven't seen
[6632.48 → 6637.92] yet which would be amazing for inside out and like the oculus and even the vision pro stuff like that
[6637.92 → 6643.60] is just fiducial markers yeah you know uh this is where my computer marker this is where my computer
[6643.60 → 6650.40] monitor is you just put a little QR code fiducial marker thing on the desk, and now it is there or you
[6650.40 → 6656.88] know you put it on a coaster you get a coaster like this yeah AR things are already a thing
[6656.88 → 6664.48] we've already got the AR uh amino things as well yeah um computer monitor right there, and then it's
[6664.48 → 6668.96] just there you want to move it a bit you just interact with a physical object right not everything
[6668.96 → 6674.16] has to be digital that'd be kind of neat yeah, and you could still you could represent it in virtual
[6674.16 → 6679.04] reality with something that looks a little bit better with just like a like command orb or something
[6679.04 → 6684.72] near that area so you know where to reach to grab it even if it's projecting a larger dive yeah right um
[6684.72 → 6688.56] but if you're doing some AR stuff then yeah then you can just see the coaster I mean that kind of
[6688.56 → 6693.28] works already with the uh you know index and individual trackers and things like that they
[6693.28 → 6700.16] are represented so I don't know yeah maybe yeah marker yeah I like that use whatever you want yeah
[6700.16 → 6706.48] poke ball marker I don't know uh mystical said that I don't sure I mean you could change it to
[6706.48 → 6712.00] whatever you want yeah should we uh should we do some merch messages oh yeah that's a thing that I was
[6712.00 → 6717.36] supposed to be doing uh you can do it from here I know but I was supposed to be doing that while i
[6717.36 → 6723.04] was here oh whatever it's fine uh I think we have only incoming yeah because I didn't do any of them
[6723.04 → 6730.40] because there's nobody over uh anonymous said AWU uh you can archive those with the button at the bottom
[6730.40 → 6738.56] no I will show it the whole stream has to be subjected to an AWU message coming up at the bottom it will happen
[6738.56 → 6744.80] in q god this is what I have to do with all day the float plane chat is currently spamming AWU
[6746.08 → 6754.96] locked I have so much power now this is awful uh disembodied head of Linus uh do you have
[6754.96 → 6760.48] any recommendations for podcasts well he's gone um so I guess we can take this one over
[6762.08 → 6766.88] uh no it was to all of us I just read the disembodied head of Linus oh took me by surprise more
[6766.88 → 6773.52] interesting yes we could do you listen to podcasts no I don't I know a lot of people that do and I was
[6773.52 → 6782.00] attempting to work on one for a while with a friend um it was like a book reading more than
[6782.00 → 6788.48] anything um little slash fiction novels I think they were like Harry Potter vintage bodice rippers from
[6788.48 → 6795.52] the 1950s well it had all been kind of lost to time um very, very interesting kind of uh like
[6796.16 → 6802.64] fiction slash like the birth of fan fiction almost uh super underground kind of thing and
[6802.64 → 6809.44] crazy got a lot of them that are very rare um so that was kind of extreme amounts of work
[6809.44 → 6817.92] like an unbelievable quantity of work um otherwise no there are some CBC ones yeah perfect yeah I've
[6817.92 → 6826.72] heard of that uh I don't listen to many um for a while there when I first started trying to do weight
[6826.72 → 6831.44] loss stuff my like knees and a lot of things were super messed up so the best thing for me to do
[6831.44 → 6836.64] was to just like go walk for like an hour and a half basically every day uh so I was listening to a
[6836.64 → 6843.68] a lot of podcasts at that time, but that was um a little bit over a year ago at this point um
[6844.56 → 6850.80] and the podcast that I mainlined at that time was the yard and human lab podcast human lab was like a
[6850.80 → 6854.24] lot of cool interesting information I was trying to be more healthy there's a lot of information for
[6854.24 → 6861.60] that in that podcast so that was cool and the yard it was just it's just like hanging out with the
[6861.60 → 6866.48] bros so it was uh more casual yeah I think you've talked about that before
[6866.48 → 6870.88] when we were doing some of the set redesign and stuff like that oh their set for the yard is
[6870.88 → 6877.68] incredible yeah yeah I would never really watch it because uh I don't know if I'm this is like i
[6877.68 → 6882.40] don't really watch TV shows or movies at home either if I'm like sitting at home and I need a recreational
[6882.40 → 6887.76] activity I'm going to play games uh so I would never really like to watch their podcast but if I was
[6887.76 → 6892.24] going out on a walk one thing that was nice is I think their podcast is usually around an hour and a
[6892.24 → 6897.76] half long so it was a good like okay I'll start it when I start walking and when it ends that's
[6897.76 → 6901.84] when I'll end therefore I'm not like checking the time all the time and going like okay only got five
[6901.84 → 6906.32] minutes left it's like no it's just whenever the podcast ends just keep going keep moving until then
[6906.88 → 6914.32] um I think for me like I don't like it's taken me a long time to get used to listening to things again
[6914.32 → 6919.84] in my free time because I was working from home a lot and of course what I used to do for work right
[6919.84 → 6923.52] I can't really listen to music or listen to podcasts while I'm doing video editing yeah
[6923.52 → 6931.28] totally or like working on podcasts or music so now i just silence like I go to the gym with you
[6931.92 → 6936.32] I don't have any headphones I don't have music I don't take a mp3 player with me, I'll go on walks
[6936.32 → 6941.68] and stuff like that and just listen to nothing it's like it messes people up sometimes yeah like I'm
[6941.68 → 6949.12] not that weird guy at the gym is just like raw dogging it just listening to nothing and enjoying it
[6949.12 → 6957.12] I can be totally down with the nothing but um if I want to do something really high effort in the
[6957.12 → 6965.76] gym I like having music because it is zones me in I know I'm not what I'll do at work yeah so it helps
[6965.76 → 6972.24] me get into those extremely deep floats flow states yes um I don't think I necessarily have gotten into
[6972.24 → 6979.28] that point at the gym um maybe eventually maybe yeah I don't know i just yeah it helps me shut off
[6979.28 → 6983.92] everything else and just like really pour into the one thing that I'm trying to do um helps me hit
[6983.92 → 6991.20] failure levels stuff like that but yeah I don't uh similar problem I can't really listen to
[6991.20 → 7000.56] a podcast and do anything relatively heavy um so unless I'm walking or driving then it's not really super
[7000.56 → 7005.52] relevant my commute to work isn't super long so it would take me like days to get through a single
[7005.52 → 7010.72] podcast which I'm not super interested in so sometimes CBC on the radio has them I like listening
[7010.72 → 7015.36] to CBC on the way in mostly because it doesn't have advertisements, but you sometimes know music
[7016.08 → 7020.08] they have a podcast playlist which is one of their segments where they recommend perfect ones
[7020.88 → 7027.36] one thing I will say is with the death of Google podcasts I recently was doing something that I was
[7027.36 → 7032.80] was very boring and monotonous and I needed a podcast to listen to so I tried to pull up some
[7032.80 → 7036.40] podcasts that I just spoke about human lab in the yard because I was like I don't know I know these
[7036.96 → 7043.44] um and I tried to do it through YouTube music what a horrible experience I really wish google
[7043.44 → 7051.04] podcasts was still around YouTube music is not an appropriate replacement for Google podcasts in my
[7051.04 → 7055.52] opinion there's a lot of difficulty with it my understanding is that you could really use anything you want
[7055.52 → 7062.08] because it's on the back of RSS yeah so when we upload to um our platform it goes everywhere all
[7062.08 → 7070.40] at once which whoever like decided it was going to work that way great job fantastic no notes yeah
[7071.44 → 7077.28] like genuinely yeah and how ownership is handled right because we've had to transfer them a few times
[7077.28 → 7080.96] yeah we used to be on Spotify now we're on a new thing called megaphone which allows us to manage
[7080.96 → 7086.16] all four or five of them at the same time which still goes to Spotify and apple and everywhere
[7086.16 → 7091.20] else like that, and they're all posted automatically I learned that because when I was experimenting with
[7091.20 → 7099.36] how podcasts work um i just I uploaded the Joe Rogan podcast to iTunes and I just had control over it
[7101.20 → 7105.44] because it's just a RSS thing, and you can just go like publish podcast
[7105.44 → 7110.64] and then the entire catalogue gets pulled automatically whoa it's fascinating um
[7111.68 → 7118.16] very strange now I understand why merch messages uh diverge so much yeah yeah yeah
[7119.04 → 7124.16] experiencing it uh I don't even know see i what was the root question you know any good podcasts
[7124.16 → 7129.52] right yeah we didn't go that far off I guess just a little bit yeah I guess so um
[7129.52 → 7137.84] um are there any plans for Ltd to release a bit set case for storing all the bits and works and
[7137.84 → 7144.16] perhaps uh spots for screwdriver stubby precision and shaft extension all of that sort of stuff on my
[7144.16 → 7150.56] understanding is in the works currently um I think there are some ideas to maybe release some 3d
[7150.56 → 7153.76] prints or something like that so you can do it yourself while we're still working through that
[7153.76 → 7163.04] I know Linus gave away one of the bit sets during the uh the stream uh the whatnot stream and
[7163.60 → 7168.24] I've seen some other mock-ups as well a bunch of people made their own yeah yeah that's cool and i
[7168.24 → 7174.48] think they have like 3d files out for it yeah and I think that we're also trying to set up like an um
[7175.68 → 7179.92] I can't remember what the platform is, but we're trying to set up a repository where we can dump all the
[7179.92 → 7186.08] 3d prints right because I know I make a lot um a lot of people here make a lot of internal ohs you
[7186.08 → 7193.12] mean oh okay sorry I was talking about uh 3d prints made by community members no I think they should
[7193.12 → 7199.12] still control those yeah you know uh but I'm sorry we're talking about completely different things
[7199.12 → 7204.64] yeah yeah yeah so I'm talking about both at the same time so we have ones that we've done and also
[7205.60 → 7209.84] people in the community have made them, and you can either download theirs or ours or design your
[7209.84 → 7214.16] own but are ours available at all yet I have no idea I don't believe so I don't think so
[7214.16 → 7218.80] we're still two in flux planning on maybe doing that at some point but right now you can find
[7218.80 → 7222.40] community ones and download them and print them I think ours is just going to be for bits but i
[7222.40 → 7225.76] don't know I'm sure nick light will message me and I will ignore that, but that's fine
[7226.48 → 7230.72] any updates with flow plane not working on Amazon fire stick uh
[7232.80 → 7236.64] no I didn't know it ever did do something better yeah
[7236.64 → 7244.08] yeah sorry um oh you're talking about ties and TV the other day and the Vimeo player not being
[7244.08 → 7250.80] able to like google cast or apple cast or something like that I don't know video sucks
[7250.80 → 7254.56] what's wrong with you why would you do this I don't like on purpose
[7257.44 → 7264.96] yeah yeah flow plane the freshness one of my like main jobs these days is trying to fight any amount of
[7264.96 → 7269.76] expansion to flow plane scope because it's like my goodness we do so many things already um I got
[7269.76 → 7275.04] signed out of all my accounts now I have to log in again I'm actually not yeah Jaden's saying in
[7275.04 → 7282.16] flow plane shop it's a MO it's a mobile app not a TV app yeah yeah yeah sorry about that
[7282.16 → 7296.64] uh hello when are the new backpack carabiner coming out um I have no idea soon just say soon to
[7296.64 → 7302.64] everything soon TM there you go yeah I know they're they're working on it, i I think they like seeded some
[7302.64 → 7308.96] of them out or something, and they're waiting for feedback maybe that's not even sort of true I have no
[7308.96 → 7313.60] idea wrong person to ask unfortunately uh you might be able to hit up creator where I'm rise up what
[7313.60 → 7333.28] up what up it's connected now we're live again uh uh uh hello no I'm not seeing anything but
[7333.28 → 7336.64] people are saying we back
[7339.60 → 7341.60] can I get some AWU's in the chat
[7348.32 → 7352.72] got him hey everyone's spamming AWU let's go leaves for one minute
[7356.16 → 7363.12] my gosh it's alive oh my goodness see you later TikTok you're no longer the
[7363.12 → 7371.76] favourite get out of here at least I got RGB now yeah so uh people watching on other platforms
[7371.76 → 7378.40] the dot wan dot show on TikTok is apparently where we're streaming uh wan show in the future
[7378.40 → 7389.84] and that was the only platform
[7393.12 → 7399.76] so
[7399.76 → 7400.32] we're back again
[7401.76 → 7402.56] what's happening
[7402.56 → 7419.04] this is why I'm supposed to stay behind the desk every time your fault okay, okay your fault
[7419.04 → 7425.20] float plane are we gone again maybe I'm still showing if chat can hear me when we're live and
[7425.20 → 7432.16] it's working you have to spam AWU's and when it dies you have to spam f's I want all the chats on all
[7432.16 → 7436.80] the platforms to go as fast as possible when I'm at my computer normally a ping 888 right
[7437.36 → 7441.84] ping 8888t this is my keep alive your keep alive is now AWU's
[7441.84 → 7448.64] this is Mechanical Turk for DNS uh pings
[7448.64 → 7455.44] it's its kind of working it is working we're getting very effective status checks
[7455.44 → 7460.08] in all the chats that I could really time it's a lot faster than ping all the chats I can see
[7460.08 → 7465.04] are just AWU's right now, and it's global which means we're working yeah yeah exactly it's its a
[7465.04 → 7469.04] it's a way to communicate with all the places that we're streaming well my heart rate's up
[7469.04 → 7477.20] I'm enjoying this there was one of the sponsor spots earlier I started cracking up because um
[7477.20 → 7482.96] it was like uh Acronis I'm going to give you guys another shout out I guess it says according to
[7482.96 → 7487.84] a study by cybersecurity ventures a cyber uh attack took place every 39 seconds last year
[7487.84 → 7496.00] trust me being hacked is not fun I was like it's kind of fun this is not it's not a suggestion please
[7496.00 → 7501.20] don't do it certainly had fun yeah, but we had a wonderful time as long as there's no like permanent
[7501.20 → 7507.44] damage it can be an exciting experience yeah we were talking about that and like that uh that rise
[7507.44 → 7512.24] to action that happens almost immediately yeah did I ever tell you the story about the car that was
[7512.24 → 7516.64] set on fire outside my house no but everyone's still spamming AWU so I know we're still good so
[7516.64 → 7522.56] please tell me nice um yeah I mean well when we got hacked both of us like immediately jumped into
[7522.56 → 7530.16] action, and it was kind of like oh okay go um and almost like detrimentally kind of activated I guess
[7530.16 → 7536.48] um, but you know I'd, I'd met a couple friends at university and I was driving them back to my place
[7536.48 → 7541.68] for the first time kind of like you know new budding friendships and like all right we're going to come hang
[7541.68 → 7547.44] out and as I'm pulling like up my street and into my driveway there's kind of like a fire down at the end
[7547.44 → 7555.52] of the road which is weird like a big fire in the street, and it's kind of down over a hill and so i
[7555.52 → 7560.40] didn't even think like I just stopped the car and got out and then just ran down the street I didn't
[7560.40 → 7565.36] even say anything to like the two people who I'm with I'm like I had I was like casual friends with
[7565.36 → 7570.40] these people uh and this was like the first experience oh we're going to go hang out with Dan, and he's just
[7570.40 → 7576.40] the fire he just leaves, and so I start sprinting down the street and I get over the top of this hill and
[7576.40 → 7582.00] like okay so it's a car set on fire and I sprint up to it and there's this poor woman there who is
[7582.00 → 7588.24] obviously freaking out um and i just basically because I understand in the bystander effect
[7588.24 → 7592.32] people just freeze and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to tell people what to do
[7592.88 → 7601.36] and for me, it was like call 9-1-1 um but like she was on the phone and I just kept like pointing and
[7601.36 → 7608.72] yelling at her uh are you talking to 9-1-1 or like are you talking to the police or something like
[7608.72 → 7615.36] that and so this guy it was night, so this guy just comes running down the hill and starts
[7615.36 → 7620.72] getting are you calling the police are you calling the police are you calling the police
[7622.88 → 7626.24] and uh so I'm pretty sure that she might have been freaked out a little bit
[7626.24 → 7635.68] uh the thing is this car was not hers uh it had most likely been dumped there and abandoned and
[7635.68 → 7645.68] set on fire after like a murder so not only that is someone screams down her street dumps a car sets
[7645.68 → 7652.48] it on fire and then like a few minutes later this random stranger comes hurtling down the street anyway
[7652.48 → 7659.84] yeah so uh maybe don't scream at people who are in a crisis who have already done the thing that they
[7659.84 → 7665.92] need to maybe not the greatest idea uh but i I will bring attention again to that my entire screen is
[7665.92 → 7673.20] just various chat spamming AWU um why do you do this which I'm enjoying very thoroughly uh usually i
[7673.20 → 7677.76] don't like it when people just spam chat super hard no but right now while we're still trying to figure
[7677.76 → 7683.04] out like what even just happened it is kind of useful to have like very up-to-date real-time
[7683.04 → 7688.80] information based on if people are receiving the stream or not for me uh my favourite is the eye
[7688.80 → 7695.52] emoji just the single eye emoji w-o I'll post that in chat it'll disappear immediately I really like
[7695.52 → 7703.52] okay float plane chat is now drawing AWU with ASCII art so they're they're evolving they have uh
[7703.52 → 7710.56] uh they need help uh what do I do a Linus laptop is that how that works there you go that one
[7711.36 → 7717.36] that's my favourite oh that's pretty good horrifying that is yeah that's like eldritch AWU
[7718.32 → 7719.60] stares into your soul
[7721.76 → 7725.44] that would make me feel better uh okay so what were we talking about we were talking about we
[7725.44 → 7733.44] had just got into you in game dev so UE 5.4 yeah so um one of the things that I learned recently is that
[7733.52 → 7741.12] doing vectorized text in game engines is extremely difficult which doesn't make a lot of sense
[7741.84 → 7747.76] um and so vectors in general are like really complicated to actually do in a game engine
[7747.76 → 7755.28] and I was kind of racking my bread my brain around how I'm going to be doing some sorry YouTube
[7755.28 → 7762.80] chat has adopted your AWU, and they're doing the I's oh i have to see that rare win for YouTube chat
[7763.52 → 7768.72] watching all the chats is particularly i have to get these open this is sick
[7770.48 → 7775.76] I will not give you 250 dollars yeah please no it says the stream's finished
[7776.48 → 7781.12] like is it no there we go yeah don't scare me like that yeah, thanks YouTube chat that's horrible
[7781.76 → 7785.52] I hate this oh there's target eyes one oh the target eyes one is good
[7785.52 → 7789.92] yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah with the lips
[7792.16 → 7796.24] oh boy okay sorry continue I don't know this is also good
[7798.08 → 7801.12] this is literally my screen right now it's just all the chats
[7802.48 → 7809.52] do you want to show it up uh sure yeah if you don't have anything for uh what is that oh that's uh
[7809.52 → 7816.40] that's the uh log does that go to them no that's what we can see okay, okay I was like I was like hide
[7817.84 → 7823.28] no that's my command window that's my uh external ping to make sure that no frames are dropping oh cool
[7823.28 → 7830.24] okay um oh my god anyway so Unreal Engine 5.4 has officially come out it's been in preview for a
[7830.24 → 7837.04] little while now, and they have all of these new systems they've got this like motion combining for
[7837.04 → 7842.48] animations the state-based thing that's really, really robust and simple to use they've got a
[7842.48 → 7848.72] bunch of new animation tools, but the coolest thing is the like motion graphics design stuff I don't
[7848.72 → 7854.40] know if you've seen any of this no I just saw that it like was happening actually bonkers like i I was
[7854.40 → 7862.00] like oh I got a little flustered it was like incredible so um basically you've got Niagara particle
[7862.00 → 7869.76] simulations um you've got you know the new lumen engine right so you can have unlimited polygons
[7870.56 → 7875.92] and then real-time particle simulations real-time physical simulations laser scans, and now they've
[7875.92 → 7882.56] introduced vector graphics as well as boolean operations layers like in photoshop they have a
[7882.56 → 7888.08] new texture designer like substance 3d substance material editors that sort of thing you can
[7888.08 → 7894.40] now do that entirely built in Unreal Engine, and it's all real time so if you're doing 3d modelling
[7894.40 → 7899.20] or like motion graphics or stuff like that normally you do cinema 4d or blender or something like that
[7900.72 → 7908.24] but now you can do that in real time with real-time lighting, and it's also all programmable because
[7908.24 → 7913.92] it's still a game engine right so you can use blueprints and do your vector animations and everything like that so
[7913.92 → 7919.44] basically this is incredible for so many things it's good for me what I was going to say what are you
[7919.44 → 7928.48] going to use it for so um I wanted to use it for an intro video as well as having some scalar scalable
[7928.48 → 7936.16] UI elements one thing that I was finding that were particularly difficult inside um Unreal Engine was
[7936.16 → 7941.28] being able to adapt to different screen sizes okay so hopefully chat relax at this guy at this point you
[7941.28 → 7946.40] guys are taking the spamming more seriously than the UB you guys gotta you guys gotta
[7946.40 → 7951.12] chill I think some of you even have like bots running or auto clickers or some or auto input things
[7951.12 → 7956.80] or something relax a little bit damn at this point I literally can't even read it because it's
[7956.80 → 7965.12] going faster than YouTube chat significantly yeah um chill dudes chill it's getting faster you're not
[7965.12 → 7970.72] helping maybe not okay I will stop addressing it maybe it will go away um
[7972.88 → 7976.72] anyway yeah so you want to use it for an intro video yeah so um
[7979.20 → 7986.64] uh do you ever seen Hal 9000 2001 space obviously that sort of thing a lot of those uh computer
[7986.64 → 7992.96] graphics that were on the screens themselves physically um are very much like blank colour plus lines, and they're
[7992.96 → 7998.40] all beautiful grids, and they look futuristic, and it's all blocky text right and that kind of theme
[7998.40 → 8005.52] was also repeated in alien and aliens and that sort of like 80s level kind of CRT technology but a vision
[8005.52 → 8014.08] of the future and a lot of it is extremely thin single lines and if I want to have uh this be adaptable to
[8014.08 → 8022.88] different screen sizes one thing that I hate is playing on my you know 4k c2 OLED and then the
[8022.88 → 8029.28] textures are all like squishy yeah because they're small now you can do that with vectors which means
[8029.92 → 8037.36] uh unlimited scaling yeah, and then they've also introduced real-time boolean operations so you
[8037.36 → 8044.24] can push objects into other objects, and you can also animate um like graphics over time and define your
[8044.24 → 8049.12] push objects into other objects' thing uh boolean operations would be like here's your cylinder
[8049.12 → 8055.12] and then I want to make a cut in this cylinder so I have an invisible card and then I push them
[8055.12 → 8060.40] together so I haven't altered this geometry traditionally boolean would be done in something
[8060.40 → 8067.92] like blender um so you would have to cut a hole in the geometry because it's like add and subtract so if
[8067.92 → 8072.96] I take these two objects and this one's a subtract it would cut into this or if I were to have this as
[8072.96 → 8078.72] an additive object it would increase, and it would still be one object, but it's made up of
[8078.72 → 8085.76] multiple objects and the geometry becomes one single like entity yeah, and normally you would do that
[8085.76 → 8091.92] operation in something like blender or traditional um, and then you would uh like finalize it
[8092.64 → 8096.88] so that object would become solid, and then you'd have to restore the whole thing right because all of
[8096.88 → 8100.88] those curves and things are going to be destroyed now you can do that in real time so I could animate
[8100.88 → 8107.52] the movement of objects through it and then huge thing most of my game is entirely made of instances
[8107.52 → 8112.72] right it's got like one cube and then everything's instance so it's performative yeah yeah um you can
[8112.72 → 8121.52] instance in the motion thing and then simulate real-time nanite particles on your objects and with lumen as
[8121.52 → 8129.12] well say the example I saw the other day was an it was a donut they had like a billion donuts are
[8129.12 → 8134.08] surprisingly common yeah yeah so obviously a cool example, but they had like a billion donuts
[8135.12 → 8141.36] being rendered in real time with shadows sheesh uh and also real-time physics so
[8143.12 → 8153.04] uh every single version is incredible and um this one for me personally has a lot of features that I'm
[8153.04 → 8158.08] going to touch a lot of complaints with Unreal Engine for a long time is that you're basically modifying
[8158.96 → 8162.32] like you're making a mod for a first-person shooter rather than making your own game
[8164.08 → 8172.00] right it's hard to do a different genre, and it's slowly getting better and I think it's slowly becoming
[8172.00 → 8177.20] just the most insane engine oh yeah obviously it's its like character driven focused yeah with the
[8177.20 → 8183.52] animation tools but I think we're also going to see a lot more uh animators coming out of this too right um
[8183.52 → 8189.36] um the way that you can do rigging and animation things, and they've automated a lot of
[8189.36 → 8195.44] the process, and they've also made it a little bit more intuitive to do and simple um for me learning 3d
[8195.44 → 8201.20] modelling is like almost impossible for characters especially because I just can't get past weight painting
[8201.76 → 8211.36] I don't know how to make a good rig and then if you want to make changes to that rig you would have to take it out of unreal right, and you'd have to re-export it and get your
[8211.36 → 8216.16] objects back and then like re-trigger everything and maybe your animations in a real world broken
[8216.16 → 8221.76] but now it's a little bit more self-contained I suspect people might especially people that have
[8221.76 → 8225.36] been in the scene for a while because when you start looking into game development there's a lot
[8225.36 → 8233.76] of like use this variety of tools to accomplish your end goal right yeah zero it's very common yeah engine
[8233.76 → 8241.84] right I think people might underestimate how much needing one thing will lower the barrier of entry for
[8241.84 → 8247.92] people this is going to lower the barrier of entry for me who is kind of already over the initial hump
[8247.92 → 8253.36] yeah like I know basically how all these programs work and which ones I'm supposed to be using I'm still just
[8253.36 → 8263.04] garbage at them all um but now that that efficacy of getting to a level right the barriers for blender
[8263.04 → 8268.48] are like okay well welcome to blender learn 400 shortcuts please and then of course they released
[8268.48 → 8274.48] 3.8 and I had to relearn like all of them or whatever the version is that they changed it and I had just
[8274.48 → 8279.76] I just learned them all and that's me because I'm a beginner right I think there's also even just like
[8279.76 → 8285.44] like the question of what game engine should I use is already difficult enough for people what
[8285.44 → 8291.60] game do you want to make yeah I don't know well then I don't know what do you play yeah I don't
[8291.60 → 8297.20] know I like lots of stuff like well maybe I want to why are you making a game what is it like after
[8297.20 → 8304.56] after that kind of Ryan lines of questioning is like okay well why because you think it's fun or
[8304.56 → 8311.20] cool I think a lot of people especially in like high school might be doing it uh just to try something
[8311.20 → 8316.08] to learn something whatever yeah, but you pick one yeah learn all three at the same time but then you
[8316.08 → 8320.32] so you have decision paralysis on the game engine, but then you also have decision paralysis on all the
[8320.32 → 8325.12] things that are associated it gets worse yeah, and it does not get better and then what everybody
[8325.12 → 8335.44] forgets about is uh audio yeah so do now do you go with f mod or what wise pick one f mod is so the
[8335.44 → 8342.64] f mod is like the audio plug-in for all of these engines and then the direct competitor is wwise
[8342.64 → 8347.28] wise I don't know actually how it's supposed to be pronounced unfortunately I like wise I like wise
[8347.92 → 8356.00] goes along with bing um but I know that that wise is more industry focused and f mod is way more
[8356.00 → 8362.96] approachable okay yeah, but they're still like okay well yeah you could do the audio inside your engine
[8362.96 → 8367.76] but it's better to have another tool that modifies that, but now you're learning that like it took me a
[8367.76 → 8374.24] while to understand that I even had to change my mindset when doing OST work because now like Celeste is
[8374.24 → 8379.04] probably the best example that uses f mod I think I've told you this before I think this is accurate
[8379.04 → 8384.64] but Celeste has every single piece of music playing simultaneously throughout the entire game uh and
[8384.64 → 8389.12] than it just dynamically picks between them and fades between them when it's appropriate right like okay
[8390.40 → 8399.44] and now I have to program that so not only are you working inside unity or your game engine now you
[8399.44 → 8406.48] have to have the conceptual kind of understanding of this thing is happening what process and what
[8406.48 → 8414.00] variable do I write that the game is going to modify that is then referred back to my audio system that
[8414.00 → 8419.20] then gets modified there and there are two different layers of there right you have like on or off or you
[8419.20 → 8427.76] can have um you know floating point stuff but then the graphs that modify the sound are inside f mod are
[8427.76 → 8433.60] different, and then you can also have global variables inside f mod to mine like manage a bunch of stuff
[8434.80 → 8441.52] and then there's bus tracks and reverb and now I'm working with steam audio which is like a ray tracing system for like
[8441.52 → 8444.40] for real time for projections and then like
[8446.72 → 8450.48] I just wanted to I just wanted to make a RTS and i just
[8451.68 → 8455.76] I want my 10 years back so which one do you said there's one that's more industry focused and one that's more approachable
[8455.76 → 8464.64] which one are you using for your uh your non-hobby project I would use f mod for both okay um mostly
[8464.64 → 8469.04] just because i kind of like f mod and that's the more approachable one already I think so I think
[8469.04 → 8476.08] actually for my personal project I will just try wise you know um I think it's probably a good opportunity
[8476.08 → 8482.96] to learn it yeah um and if it doesn't work you know stick back to f mod yeah cool um I learned substance
[8482.96 → 8488.48] painter substance painter is a lot easier to get your head around after you understand how it works
[8489.12 → 8494.88] uh it's not like photoshop it's about it does it for you, but you have to kind of make it do it for you
[8495.44 → 8501.36] and your personal project one you said it's a 3d game it is a 3d game which one of the reasons why
[8501.36 → 8509.20] I went with um unreal um I did try to remake it in godot uh, but yeah do you know which one it is
[8509.20 → 8515.28] I believe it's Godot i I hear people that I like saying Godot work in it semi-professionally
[8515.28 → 8520.16] say it both ways I'm not sure I mean it might be it might be like a bunch of different pronunciations
[8520.16 → 8528.16] yeah, yeah anyway sorry but yeah 3d engine um, but it's quite static the problem is that there's a lot
[8528.16 → 8533.76] of rotations and there's a lot of vector math and there's a lot of um automatic generations and objects
[8533.76 → 8540.48] and it can be a little bit complicated especially trying to keep it performative when yeah sorry
[8540.48 → 8545.12] sorry everyone just noticed the dead pixel where is a dead pixel
[8548.08 → 8550.40] right there oh, oh crap
[8552.80 → 8556.08] I think people have been spamming about it oh no let me look
[8556.08 → 8559.36] is it
[8563.60 → 8563.92] yeah
[8566.40 → 8566.72] yeah
[8569.52 → 8570.08] oh no
[8570.56 → 8570.96] yeah
[8574.48 → 8576.16] I mean these cameras are getting on a bit
[8577.76 → 8583.52] luckily at least people only noticed it now so it's not going to drive them nuts for the whole stream
[8586.56 → 8588.72] that one looks okay yeah I think you're good
[8590.32 → 8591.68] oh, oh no
[8595.12 → 8598.08] I can't even point it though no it's too far I see it too
[8598.64 → 8607.36] does my hand get in this screen yeah up there yeah okay well all right oh no so it's not every camera
[8607.36 → 8608.96] but yeah two of them
[8611.84 → 8612.40] oh
[8612.40 → 8612.64] uh
[8613.84 → 8615.20] whatever whatever whatever
[8618.00 → 8618.64] what was that
[8622.48 → 8625.76] someone threw these at us that's cool
[8625.76 → 8631.12] get out of here
[8631.12 → 8632.00] sponsorship
[8632.00 → 8632.72] um
[8634.72 → 8635.44] what did
[8635.44 → 8636.40] cube 3d
[8636.40 → 8637.76] why did that just happen okay
[8637.76 → 8638.40] don't think about it
[8639.60 → 8643.12] yeah so why did you decide to go with because you
[8643.12 → 8646.16] blueprints I like unreal because of blueprints okay
[8646.16 → 8652.32] so blueprints are phenomenal for a really approachable way of getting programming done it's maybe
[8652.32 → 8655.60] it's not quite as performative as programming in c plus
[8656.40 → 8658.96] obviously there's some overhead uh but
[8659.76 → 8665.76] they're good, and you can also use them to move into c plus because you can write blueprints
[8665.76 → 8670.08] and each little node is basically just a c plus object so you can
[8670.72 → 8673.52] dive into them and write a custom blueprint note yeah
[8674.40 → 8679.28] so that's a good answer and a good point and i I do also think blueprints are cool but what i really
[8679.28 → 8683.36] meant was why did you decide to do 3d for this game because the way that you've described it
[8683.36 → 8684.24] because it needs to be
[8684.88 → 8685.36] so why
[8686.16 → 8689.60] um because of the way that the space is represented
[8690.64 → 8694.16] so I wanted it to feel claustrophobic
[8694.88 → 8695.36] oh okay
[8696.00 → 8696.40] and
[8697.92 → 8699.92] the limiting space factor
[8700.56 → 8706.40] also had to be in 3d so you've seen uh the windows like 95 screensavers with the pipes right
[8706.40 → 8709.76] yes love it so it's always loved it
[8711.76 → 8717.28] but as a game yeah and like a resource management it's a resource management game so you're inside a
[8717.28 → 8722.32] cube yeah right and each of the walls are kind of like your factories or whatever you want to
[8722.32 → 8726.16] think about it however you want to abstract it away this one makes this number go up this one
[8726.16 → 8730.40] makes a different number go up and each of them have different requirements, and you have to connect
[8730.40 → 8735.28] them together with wires basically like pipes right and so if you can think about
[8736.56 → 8740.32] laying pipes in 3d to each of the walls
[8742.08 → 8748.64] and I think there's something like 400 individual node points that are uh available uh for me to use
[8748.64 → 8754.88] at least um maybe not to the player that's a little bit ridiculous so now we've got 400 nodes 400 nodes
[8754.88 → 8760.48] and now all the wires have to connect to each other like the difficulty is in managing those
[8760.48 → 8767.04] connections and figuring out where they go and uh, uh like even just how to route them and how to keep them
[8767.04 → 8771.60] organized I don't know if you've ever played factor or something like that but keeping the belts all pretty
[8772.24 → 8778.08] and like flowing and organized is kind of like a fun way to uh to play factor, or you can do spaghetti
[8778.08 → 8789.76] um and the resource in this game is the walls yeah so like the amount of space you have on the walls
[8789.76 → 8795.04] that's right yeah and then yeah I guess you'll like tech up over time and whatnot yes exactly but to
[8795.04 → 8802.56] replace something you have to destroy it which might at least temporarily ruin economy I'm assuming
[8802.56 → 8812.64] it's actually like you're yourself so like you die because you're the computer that the outside
[8812.64 → 8819.04] walls are powering and so it can cause cascading failures so you like you delete one little module
[8819.04 → 8825.28] and you didn't lay out your wires so all the wires go away right, and now you have to trace back and
[8825.28 → 8829.68] find it, and you have like 30 40 seconds or something like that to get the new module and the wires plug back
[8829.68 → 8834.96] in um or like yeah I don't know you run out of power and die critical failure
[8834.96 → 8840.40] blue screen and I just added this new system called abstraction where you can add in another cube next
[8840.40 → 8847.12] to it and have resources that pass through the walls right and I spent like three hours working on this
[8847.12 → 8852.24] dolly zoom thing where the cube uh comes into your view which is normally an isometric right and then it
[8852.24 → 8859.44] pulls out into um uh orthogonal right, and then you can move around and pick your next cube and then you
[8859.44 → 8865.60] zoom back in right and so now not only are you managing with the wires that are going in the cube
[8865.60 → 8872.56] you're now managing uh cubes on top of cubes right so think the my elevator pitch is like uh factor
[8872.56 → 8879.60] inside a 4d hypercube yeah, yeah right so it's factor in 3d space but if you up the wires you die sorry
[8879.60 → 8889.52] I always forget I don't even think it's playing right now whatever oh it's fine um yeah okay there's
[8889.52 → 8894.40] a fun sort of offshoot tangent do you want to explain how the swear button works because you just said i
[8894.40 → 8897.36] don't think it's playing right now and I think people might not necessarily understand what that
[8897.36 → 8908.00] means oh yeah so swear button is a track inside reaper um, and it has a tone that is like the c a 400 or
[8908.00 → 8917.68] whatever it is uh that is the swear noise and then the swear button here uh actually just solos that
[8917.68 → 8925.52] track which mutes all of us because if is I were to put a swear bleep over just my mic here Luke's mic
[8925.52 → 8931.28] would pick it up anyway right so I have to kill all the mics simultaneously right so that's a
[8931.28 → 8937.36] pretty quick and easy way to do that uh if you push it you still have to still have to push the
[8937.36 → 8944.80] button sorry the uh I'm trying to go through merch messages while we're talking about this a significant
[8944.80 → 8952.24] amount of merch messages are just you know worth if it's worth it which is making my job a lot easier
[8952.24 → 8957.28] right now so I appreciate it yeah um what else can we talk about I don't know what's going on
[8957.28 → 8962.64] dude you mentioned something about trying Godot oh yeah I've been I've been doing just talk game
[8962.64 → 8968.88] dev all the time I have a lot of thoughts uh they will get well I mean we're just tangent to go into
[8968.88 → 8973.28] more game dev yeah so I don't know I'm just trying to keep the conversation I'm new at this okay yeah i
[8973.28 → 8977.68] mean i I've been doing it just as like a learning thing like i I feel like you're going on a direction
[8977.68 → 8983.28] of you might actually like to do something with this I've made like 15 games sorry I have failed
[8983.84 → 8988.88] at making 15 so I'm there that's a good way of saying it I'm planning on failing on making you
[8988.88 → 8994.08] will fail at making a lot of games and the more games you fail at making this goes for you guys out
[8994.08 → 9002.64] there to the more times you fail the more times you've done a thing at all yeah fair enough yeah so
[9002.64 → 9006.88] like but like I'm not even necessarily the plan isn't even necessarily to ever succeed yeah I'm just
[9006.88 → 9011.12] having fun poking around seeing how things work I was having fun initially and then I'm kind of like
[9011.12 → 9017.20] wow uh like I got past minimum viable product okay and i I got to play it for like the 20 seconds that
[9017.20 → 9026.08] you could like that was fun did you die did your robot die i no i mostly just die
[9026.08 → 9030.16] because I'm testing to make sure it triggers properly right that makes and at what point you
[9030.16 → 9034.16] delete the wrong wire you die you delete the end point that's feeding another thing you die
[9034.16 → 9039.52] you delete the middle point you die uh right you need to keep that and so like redundant systems
[9039.52 → 9043.76] and I don't know it's going to be ridiculous I think it'll be fun yeah I'm still I'm still just
[9043.76 → 9048.80] working on clear codes clear code has this tutorial on YouTube that's 11 and a half hours long and then
[9048.80 → 9052.80] you realize that there's like a three-hour extension to it, and it's like oh yeah part two I sent that to
[9052.80 → 9057.52] a friend recently he wants to get into game dev it's fantastic it's really, really good um he even
[9057.52 → 9062.96] knows what he wants to make that's nice, and he hasn't changed what he wants to make in a couple
[9062.96 → 9067.68] years I change what I want to make essentially every time I sit down and work on it, but that's
[9067.68 → 9071.12] I'm completely okay with that right now because I'll just like blow up everything I've done and i
[9071.12 → 9075.60] want to learn how to make this system yeah yeah it's like what if i what is I did these things would
[9075.60 → 9082.16] that work and then I smash it together I'm like no or yes or whatever else yeah yeah here's some
[9082.16 → 9087.60] advice don't do anything with an inventory system yeah that sounds great ever yeah my current plan is
[9087.60 → 9091.92] to do so but I mean it'll probably change by next time you might actually know how to handle that
[9091.92 → 9098.40] probably better than I don't know I don't do not make a RPG I will shoot you that is 100 the current
[9098.40 → 9104.80] plan my current plan you suck so the the game that I currently want to make
[9104.80 → 9111.68] um the game that I currently want to make I would not be able to release because there's too much like
[9112.24 → 9122.64] it entirely leans on another IP oh yeah uh so i I want to remake in 2d a like old school RPG version
[9123.20 → 9130.56] of the starting town for wood elves in uh ever quest one called telethon okay
[9130.56 → 9137.44] because that was like the cook that was the first MMO that I played I remember how the city looked
[9137.44 → 9142.72] I'm not even gonna you can go back and play it there's like 99 uh 1999 scape or something like
[9142.72 → 9150.64] that 2007 scape 2007 scape haha why did I say 99 I don't know no idea um oh gee wait no that's
[9150.64 → 9160.08] RuneScape no, no project 99 is uh ever quest okay project I think it's called project 99 I thought it's
[9160.08 → 9167.36] project okay all right 99 yeah project 1999 classic ever quest 2007 scape is RuneScape that's
[9167.36 → 9171.92] what I thought you meant I'm talking about ever quest okay um so i I played both of those games when i
[9171.92 → 9177.92] was a wee one um but yeah I'm just like my theory with that is I can just make that like starting
[9177.92 → 9183.68] area with you know the crush bone orcs I don't know why I remember this I didn't play project 99
[9183.68 → 9188.32] I just remember this from when I was like 10 in their right yeah so i i I can make the orcs I can make
[9188.32 → 9191.68] that area I can make the skeletons outside the town I can make little bee things that you fight
[9191.68 → 9196.32] I can make the town I can do all this other kind of stuff and by doing that it gives me a fairly
[9196.32 → 9202.80] defined scope and that's why I wanted to do that I don't plan to make it a whole game just the starting
[9202.80 → 9207.12] area I know the enemies I know the areas I don't have to think about a map anymore I don't have to
[9207.12 → 9212.00] think about the music anymore I don't have to think about the names of things anymore I just build the
[9212.00 → 9217.36] things and try to make them work and then I'm going to fail in 87 different ways and then I can't release it
[9217.36 → 9223.60] anyway so it's like a project that is intentionally never going to work because I could never release
[9223.60 → 9230.16] it because it's based on someone else's game I think another thing that I ran into a lot when
[9230.16 → 9236.40] I was starting to not even beyond scope right it was like what system do I fail at right so here's a
[9236.40 → 9243.12] concept for a game that's nice and simple um how fast can I get to where I can't do it anymore i really
[9243.12 → 9248.24] like RTS and I really like obviously resource management games and I'm I want to go home and i
[9248.24 → 9252.80] want to relax so I'm not going to be doing anything that's super high energy and I don't necessarily
[9252.80 → 9258.72] like the external pressure of like hey do this thing, or you die um because I'm an antagonist
[9259.44 → 9265.84] like my game you're your own antagonist it's your fault yeah you suck you're your worst enemy so you're
[9265.84 → 9270.96] attempting to be right, and so I wanted to move into like RTS style that you know town management just for
[9270.96 → 9275.84] fun and because I like them, and it's its entertaining to work on uh and then I was like
[9275.84 → 9281.28] oh it's Friday all right so now I just got to make the little dudes like walk around each other
[9281.28 → 9288.48] and uh and like get past objects that I build and then I learned what a star pathfinding was
[9289.84 → 9294.08] and I thought I'd have that done in like an afternoon and then I discovered that people write
[9294.08 → 9299.04] PhD theses on uh on pathfinding algorithms every once in a while i I like watching
[9300.00 → 9304.00] visualizations of algorithms on YouTube because I find it fun and pathfinding ones are like super
[9304.00 → 9308.80] interesting I did about a week of that before I went nope yeah, yeah okay so this entire genre
[9309.68 → 9314.16] is off the checklist right so you're basically building like a model of like okay well I can't do
[9314.16 → 9320.64] this for me, I can't do art like I can't do 3d art very well okay right I'm not super great at 2d art
[9320.64 → 9326.80] besides I don't know marker stippling stuff can't really make a game out of that uh so now I need a
[9326.80 → 9330.96] concept people have made games out of a lot of i was going to do a game jam with one I made out of
[9330.96 → 9337.36] clay which would have been fun yeah stop-motion clay yeah um right so you're kind of breaking down this
[9337.36 → 9343.76] this what things am I good at slash enjoy you don't even know what you can't do totally you have to
[9343.76 → 9348.72] try, and it's weird, and it comes out of nowhere and there are things that you don't expect like um
[9348.72 → 9357.60] uh text layout and like UX design yeah I hate that uh I'm not very good at this yeah
[9358.48 → 9361.36] I can't get it from where I see it in my brain to where it looks pretty
[9362.08 → 9367.12] or right, and then you're going to look at your project, and it's always going to be this like mark on
[9367.12 → 9374.40] it I don't know I've always enjoyed projectiles like I made an in high school we had a had a
[9374.40 → 9380.40] course that my absolutely fantastic teacher who's a principal at a different school now um but Mr
[9380.40 → 9386.16] rattle he came he made a course for the people in like effectively my grade because he could tell
[9386.16 → 9390.24] we were all very interested in this, and it's called 3d game programming as far as I can tell he like
[9390.24 → 9395.20] went to bit over the summer and like learned some stuff and turned it into a high school course for
[9395.20 → 9403.52] us which is just so sick um and the game that I made for that was I i just uh I pulled a
[9403.52 → 9408.24] battle state games making Markov and just downloaded some assets instead of making them myself because
[9408.80 → 9413.12] uh some people were more interested in like making the 3d models and I was like I suck at this you do
[9413.12 → 9418.96] well on steam in current year yeah yeah that flips a bit of a thing I've noticed that on the same side of
[9418.96 → 9423.68] the coin nobody cares if you make your own assets either yeah so I was your main character in my
[9423.68 → 9430.88] game was a snowman okay, and you shot basketballs out of your face at ninjas um let's go so I was
[9430.88 → 9436.16] just like whatever it's like the easiest to find models I could find, and my whole point was effectively
[9436.16 → 9440.48] I shouldn't have done this I was like trying to make a point like I don't like making 3d models
[9440.48 → 9444.88] because I was a dummy and just I guess wanted a lower grade I don't know it's a stupid kid but
[9444.88 → 9451.04] um i I like wanted to focus on the mechanics of the game so i I focused on the like projectile
[9451.04 → 9458.24] physics of this basketball basically so it could like bounce and then off of the varied terrain
[9458.24 → 9464.56] and then hit the ninjas in different ways and stuff um i I don't know I think it's I think i
[9464.56 → 9468.08] still have the code somewhere but like just gives me nightmares about collision detection
[9469.20 → 9474.56] yeah but I like that I know yeah right and so that's kind of like where you're like that's
[9474.56 → 9479.68] that's now your game I'm literally doing that stuff now in Godot I'm stuck on collision detection
[9479.68 → 9484.80] because I'm enjoying if it's been a fun process and like what is your and what happens after what
[9484.80 → 9492.64] is your collision update rate yes and is it decoupled from the frame rate yes it is good answer um but
[9492.64 → 9501.44] but that it is not it's not right uh if I remember correctly Godot does um Godot has built-in
[9501.44 → 9508.24] ways doesn't let you do it the wrong way they do let you okay, but they throw warnings good you
[9508.24 → 9513.12] can ignore them it'll compile with those warnings, and you can play the game, but it will be coupled
[9513.12 → 9517.68] to the frame rate um, but it makes it really easy because when it throws one of those warnings it'll
[9517.84 → 9525.04] it'll modern like IDE's are so fascinating to me because back when I was doing programming heavily
[9525.04 → 9529.28] there was no like GitHub and all the ids like sucked and everything was terrible and now everything's
[9529.28 → 9534.72] like so helpful and nice yeah um, but it'll tell you yeah exactly where the problem is and link the
[9534.72 → 9540.88] documentation that will help you solve it so like I ran into this problem honestly yeah clear code ended
[9540.88 → 9546.96] up explaining it like seconds after I dove through it which was fine but um i i I dove through the
[9546.96 → 9551.52] problem because I was like this is dumb because I was watching the clear code video and I could
[9551.52 → 9556.48] see the thing moving across his screen and I could see it moving across my screen I was like these are not
[9556.48 → 9561.28] at the same rate something is wrong I think it's tied to frame rate this is terrifying I have to fix
[9561.28 → 9565.76] this, and then he ends up explaining how to fix it in his video it's actually super, super easy there's
[9565.76 → 9572.00] there's stuff built into Godot to help you fix timing which is great it's really nice um it's its
[9572.00 → 9578.56] super easy to mess up in Unreal Engine because like event tick is right there you can just drag off of it
[9578.56 → 9588.40] but I want my game to run at you know 140 200 fps um I can't be searching through arrays every
[9590.08 → 9593.12] uh you know what it would like one millisecond
[9595.20 → 9600.48] I don't think so it's its just performative right it's also just like if you aim to
[9600.48 → 9609.60] make a game super performant the main benefit in my mind is that it can be not performant and still
[9609.60 → 9615.28] playable if it you can play it on something that's junk, and it's still a playable game i to me
[9615.28 → 9623.12] most games 240 fps I'm too old to be fps competitive like it's not going to make a difference for me yeah
[9623.12 → 9628.32] but that's that's one of my I have two core tenants for this support any screen resolution
[9628.32 → 9638.56] in any aspect ratio and have it run at high refresh rate I'm struggling because the game view is one
[9638.56 → 9647.68] to one okay because it's cube you're inside a cube okay yeah so that's not super hard to render
[9648.96 → 9657.20] it's limited right yeah um where do you put the UI when you're on a super ultra-wide like I've got a
[9657.20 → 9662.80] super ultra-wide on my desk there, and so I'm playing on this how do I make use of like two
[9662.80 → 9671.12] feet of black bars yeah I feel like, so there's like those kinds of problems too right I feel like my
[9671.12 → 9674.88] solution because this is stuff I don't like working on so I feel like my solution would just be like
[9674.88 → 9680.80] stretch graphic of some kind I was just I just have them here, but then they're tabbed and no I mean
[9680.80 → 9688.16] like just yeah have the UI be tucked in and then so you don't have black bars just like make it uh
[9688.16 → 9692.88] take some like graphic that's like the inside of a computer system to some degree and then just
[9692.88 → 9698.00] stretch until the end like whatever cool that's actually a great idea i I don't know if it's a
[9698.00 → 9700.88] great idea, but that's the type of thing that I would do because I'm just like I don't want to deal
[9700.88 → 9705.84] with this problem go away, but there's a lot of stuff in the UI that's tied to tick or that's tied to
[9705.84 → 9712.32] updates that need to happen constantly because you know you delete something um the propagation
[9712.32 → 9718.32] might take a couple seconds right and the bricks themselves are constantly checking to make
[9718.32 → 9725.28] sure that they're still alive basically uh they have the requirements met right and so if I was doing
[9725.28 → 9736.56] that 200 times a second it would be uh insane so you know like one every 10 i one 10th of a second
[9736.56 → 9741.76] it's totally fine yeah lets uh let's try to power through some merch messages and then and then
[9741.76 → 9746.88] bring this thing to an end um I've got one for you which is about what we're currently talking about
[9746.88 → 9751.52] so we're really not going that far off but uh Dan isn't your game basically an allegory for
[9751.52 → 9760.08] self-improvement you have to leave your comfort zone in order to advance uh yes um it is and um
[9761.52 → 9768.00] I've built it on the kind of the mindset is like shelves so you know I've climbed up to this level
[9768.56 → 9774.00] I'm comfortable here everything's fine I mean the game's the game's called a copacetic right so
[9775.12 → 9780.48] it's its it's cool you know you're you're cool you're fine uh, but you can't go anywhere like you
[9780.48 → 9786.00] can't get to the next level you can't get the next research you can't expand at all um, and you have
[9786.00 → 9791.52] to do something scary I mean you can prepare for it that's the nice thing about if it's not there's no
[9791.52 → 9795.12] time pressure you can sit there for years you turn the game off you can walk away forever, and you're
[9795.12 → 9800.80] not going to have a problem uh, but you're not going anywhere until you start destroying things
[9802.00 → 9808.16] so that they can be built back better it's like it's like life it's like poetry you know they rhyme
[9808.16 → 9817.52] uh very nice I've got another one for probably you um hey Dan and Luke whatever I've been using
[9817.52 → 9823.20] tinker cad for all my 3d print modelling really want to start using a more in-depth cad software
[9823.20 → 9830.96] what do you use slash recommend that's entirely on you, I use SolidWorks um which is not necessarily for
[9830.96 → 9840.96] everyone um there are loads of them I'm not a huge fan of um okay remember what the other one is now
[9840.96 → 9847.36] the Autodesk products fusion 360 thank you um mostly because what they've been doing to like creators and
[9847.36 → 9853.76] and people that use it they used to have a discounted maker uh tier like if you didn't really make money
[9853.76 → 9859.92] with it, you could learn it, and then they did a Markov where they just got rid of that and now you
[9859.92 → 9865.12] have to pay a subscription and everything's like cloud-based, and it's really expensive um not that
[9865.12 → 9871.28] SolidWorks any better they're extremely expensive, but there's lots of like free parametric stuff
[9871.28 → 9878.16] I'd say that SolidWorks is attainable to uh people if you really want to learn it um
[9878.16 → 9886.24] um I don't know for a lot of people right now SolidWorks lately yeah I get on SolidWorks
[9886.24 → 9892.08] SolidWorks will teach you a lot of transferable skills um, but you know parametric is the skill
[9892.72 → 9898.40] I'm ice I'm perfect at parametric modelling not like some of the designers we have in CW
[9898.40 → 9905.52] but I understand parametric model I don't understand blender like I've been modelling since high school right
[9905.52 → 9914.96] um but I can make cubes nice I can't make uh people right makes sense there are loads of free
[9914.96 → 9921.60] ones and there are loads of good ones rhino is probably one to look at but uh SolidWorks hi DLL i
[9921.60 → 9928.40] recently had to log into a laptop that I hadn't used in 15 years not knowing my password I used fingerprint
[9928.40 → 9934.48] login what are your thoughts uh regarding the use of biometrics with them being hard to change
[9935.52 → 9944.96] being hard to change lighter like your own biometrics don't hard to change really hot car oh my
[9944.96 → 9954.40] goodness uh wow um that's an interesting question that is an interesting question what happens if you
[9954.40 → 9956.48] lose your finger in a government facility
[9956.48 → 9962.56] slightly oddly specific uh
[9966.32 → 9970.88] uh we hired our keys when we're on camera do we have to start like doing this sort of thing
[9971.76 → 9976.80] I think our cameras are maybe not good enough for that they're breaking i have to get new cameras now
[9976.80 → 9986.80] yeah yeah where is if it's right here um oh well we don't have any more of these yeah we are this
[9986.80 → 9990.16] is literally all three of them isn't it yeah that's right and someone pointed out apparently the one that
[9990.16 → 9994.72] we thought was fine actually does have one your one I don't know what one it was because I didn't see it
[9995.28 → 10003.52] uh what is it looping cam oh I still don't see it where we have that thing on the screen oh is that covering it
[10003.52 → 10007.92] there's a thing on the screen that you guys can't see that we can see is it behind that
[10010.08 → 10017.52] uh you're over it yeah not over the bar though there you go I still don't see it
[10022.16 → 10032.00] oh, oh there it is so it was behind the thing oh that sucks well cool okay whatever
[10032.00 → 10039.36] uh oh biometrics I think biometrics are pretty cool actually um are you game with them not
[10039.36 → 10046.32] changing I mean mostly that's okay yeah if it was face ID would it no longer recognize you
[10047.12 → 10052.96] if it's been 50 years it absolutely could also if ifs say heaven forbid there was like an acid
[10052.96 → 10060.00] attack or something that happened like yeah bad shaving for sure usually i and I think this was
[10060.00 → 10064.16] the case in this situation as well though usually biometric logins are backed up by passwords
[10065.04 → 10071.60] so it's not your only way to get in um which is why I generally think they're cool um should we move
[10071.60 → 10080.72] to chips embedded I've always like i I knew some uh get them for here biohacker dudes when I was in high
[10080.72 → 10088.16] school that were doing that um like way before it was it's not it's not normal now but this was like way
[10088.16 → 10092.96] back, and they sent me a video of them just like hanging out in this like basement suite that they
[10092.96 → 10097.84] all rented together like stabbing themselves with giant needles yeah I've always kind of wanted the
[10097.84 → 10104.72] magnets oh yeah fingerprint fingertip magnets you can feel electricity yeah that's pretty interesting
[10105.28 → 10114.16] uh anyway that's a topic I have no right to talk about um with that attitude get some experience there
[10114.16 → 10118.64] look Stephen d Stephen d says I'm almost four months behind it would be awesome if you could
[10118.64 → 10123.52] read this message on stream to remind me that I sent a merch message when I finally catch up there you go
[10123.52 → 10132.56] done um hey Ellen d I hope you're doing well I recently started my data centre career with Amazon
[10132.56 → 10138.64] and things have been interesting what is the junkiest thing you've seen a big company do not count LDT i
[10138.64 → 10144.40] have an answer do you I was able to pre-think about this so I could go first if you want I'm not sure
[10146.64 → 10155.20] I've seen an uh like server room type situation where the power was controlled with a light switch
[10157.76 → 10161.76] and the light switch was not in like a security box or anything there was just like a piece of paper
[10161.76 → 10171.52] thing to it that was like don't flip regular ups testing yeah that's all it was it's its very astute
[10171.52 → 10181.92] business decision yeah yeah I've also seen the like hey the server is this laptop don't unplug it
[10181.92 → 10189.36] I think that okay junkiest thing I worked at a job, and they needed a microwave link
[10190.80 → 10197.04] um, but they couldn't really get a very expensive powerful one right uh they're kind of difficult to
[10197.04 → 10204.24] get you need special regulations not if you set the country to a different country and then just set it
[10204.24 → 10212.72] to like nuclear power levels of bird melting it can go whatever distance you want that's I think i
[10212.72 → 10218.56] don't know if that's Jacky or just extremely reckless but I think it was an illegal to uh to a building
[10218.56 → 10223.76] like oh we just had this pole we bought this giant microwave transmitter off of eBay for like 300 bucks
[10223.76 → 10229.52] and we're just going to zap strap and then set it to melt birds sheesh it gets 200 feet now
[10229.52 → 10238.88] but it's solved it's all um don't walk under it what happens what is this did you create this
[10238.88 → 10246.72] one uh what happens oh streak my brain I also read strip I read steak oh no steak yeah steak
[10248.00 → 10254.40] okay so hey Dan and Luke and Linus what happens when the streak breaks will you start a new one or open
[10254.40 → 10262.16] one to other hosts you plan to uh replace who has been uh in established positions for some time
[10263.28 → 10267.12] uh I think this is one of those situations where I'm going to give the really annoying answer of the
[10267.12 → 10272.40] streak's not going to break I don't think so yeah that's kind of the idea I think at this point we've
[10272.40 → 10278.96] all described the like relatively atomic scenarios that we would go through in order to keep the streak
[10278.96 → 10291.12] going so uh i I don't necessarily really see it happening I don't know I don't think so I would like to uh
[10291.12 → 10299.60] like I've done the production remote I would like to try it from far away Vancouver Island in October yeah
[10299.60 → 10308.00] yeah yeah I think that would be fun yeah yeah how remote have you done this dream my house yeah okay I think
[10308.00 → 10313.68] it's I think it's fine there will just be little delays not even because I'm coming in like uh
[10315.04 → 10320.88] I don't know like basically Linus's level right it's 300 milliseconds or fewer that's what I'm saying
[10320.88 → 10327.28] like very little yeah shouldn't even really matter much um but yeah I don't know there is no plan in
[10327.28 → 10335.04] place because I don't think I think we're all rather stubborn people yeah the streak is to do it
[10335.04 → 10344.64] every week forever yeah uh hi DL Luke have you watched amc's show halt and catch fire i strongly
[10344.64 → 10355.12] recommend it no never heard of it uh it's good show is AMC watchable up here without Linux ISOs i uh
[10355.12 → 10366.16] uh I don't know I don't know about any of these Sean Sean Sean I don't I don't watch TV sure says
[10366.16 → 10374.88] awesome show halt and catch fire what is this it's like a birth of computers oh but as a drama, and it's
[10374.88 → 10381.20] fun it's very fun cool uh not that I have seen it or consume any media because no of course not
[10381.20 → 10388.80] just a server full of Linux ISOs anyway uh I think that's it I think we're done I think we just
[10388.80 → 10396.88] finished the show okay so you want to say the line uh you don't have to if I can even remember
[10396.88 → 10402.24] I'm mostly focused on just getting ready to push this button and oh okay I'll do same thanks for

[10410.56 → 10417.92] be a different time oh yeah no it'll, it'll be later than this is when we're supposed to start
