Very sorry about the delay, can't promise on-time stamps anymore but I'll try my best!

I don't understand the timestamp obsession. I can't go a single week without listening to WAN show beginning to end. I couldn't care less about timestamps, I just start at 0 and make my way through it

Holy fuck this sucks without timestamps... I don't give a shit about random people's questions or the 3000th plushie you released

[2024-09-02T13:19:00Z] Video: The Site That Taught Me Everything Is Dead - WAN Show August 30, 2024 
Dislike because 3 days later, still no timestamps!

[2024-09-02T07:29:43Z] Video: The Site That Taught Me Everything Is Dead - WAN Show August 30, 2024 
This came out over 2 days ago and there are no timestamps? That's wild. Please start doing them, can't rely on timestamp guy to save the day every week!!

Noki1119 (timestamps guy) said that due to their network bandwidth issue, they may stop putting timestamps on WAN shows going forward.

Message from NoKi1119's (timestamp guy) community post on his channel:


Not sure if I can do timestamps after this WAN Show anymore.

I've been hitting the monthly network bandwidth every two WAN Shows. Both YouTube and Twitch are buffering regardless of quality chosen, and FP streams at the highest quality your network can handle. Seconds of buffering desyncronize the stopwatch I use to line up the timecodes properly, forcing me to go back and re-write them again only after VOD releases, letting me do double the work by waiting potentially hours to correct all the misaligned timecodes.

Still funny reading all the "but you can use AI with your data/why won't LMG hire someone to do it over the weekend" comments when it takes as long as the show or, at times, double it or even multiple days throughout sessions to write every one of these chapters. It's all manual, folks. I could wait for after the VOD releases and then start doing the timestamps, but I made everyone have the unrealistic expectation of immediately available timestamps as soon as the stream finished - past me set the bar higher than I can reach, haha.

I'm doing these while half asleep at 2-8 AM on a broken PC/phone with a limited bandwidth. I've been doing this for as long as I can because I loved doing it, it gave me a reason to go online more often. I'm grateful for every comment under my timestamps, each one of them made me smile. I tried retiring in the past, and yet I'm still doing it - hopefully I can find a way to solve this issue so I'm not forced to retire once more.

See you later today or tomorrow whenever I make the timestamps. Until then.

it always amazes me that you can have 100+ staff, be a multimillion dollar company, be the host, have a list of topics in advance, have 3+ people running a basic show, be techy enough to understand timestamps and chapters, and still not have time stamps 24 hours later.... just admit you dont want timestamps lol

Everybody be like timestamp guy we need you.

@NoKi1119 I just hope you're okay, you wrote about not feeling too well last week.

It's 3 hours and youtube has shitty scrolling/scrubbing through the timeline. I ain't got time without timestamps.
