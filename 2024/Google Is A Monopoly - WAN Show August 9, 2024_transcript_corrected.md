[0.72 → 3.46] What's up everybody and welcome to the WAD Show!
[3.86 → 6.82] Hope you all had a wonderful week so far.
[7.06 → 8.48] It's about to get even better.
[8.56 → 11.36] That's right, my friends, we've got lots of good news this week.
[11.66 → 13.96] Google is officially a monopoly.
[15.08 → 16.14] Wow, really?
[16.64 → 18.38] No way, what?
[18.78 → 19.98] Oh, this is amazing.
[20.16 → 21.10] I can't believe this is happening.
[21.52 → 25.48] YouTube is testing Twitter-issue notes,
[25.48 → 30.82] which will allow community members to issue corrections on videos.
[31.26 → 31.68] Fascinating.
[31.74 → 33.82] What else we got this week, Mr. Luke Cafetière?
[36.14 → 38.44] So much for our 60 milliseconds of latency.
[38.68 → 40.52] I would be able to tell you if I actively have the dock open.
[40.80 → 41.84] That's fantastic.
[42.10 → 45.44] So it wasn't a connection latency issue, it was a brain latency issue.
[46.58 → 48.62] You still don't have the dock open, do you?
[48.88 → 49.24] Wow.
[49.58 → 50.06] Good lord.
[50.12 → 51.86] I don't think we're actually at that right now.
[51.86 → 55.08] But anyway, what's in the dock?
[55.08 → 55.76] What's interesting?
[56.78 → 58.24] Did you mention Coffeyville?
[59.10 → 59.62] No.
[62.82 → 63.48] All right.
[63.56 → 65.96] Logan Paul Su's Coffeyville for defamation.
[66.20 → 68.34] That's totally going to work, of course.
[68.52 → 70.04] Also, Rip Game Informer.
[70.36 → 73.04] 33 years long, they've been running, and now they're gone.
[82.42 → 83.78] I'm lagging like crazy.
[83.94 → 84.66] I'm going to try to fix it.
[85.08 → 89.38] Pop a caffeine pill.
[93.06 → 93.92] Ooh, there we go.
[94.02 → 94.36] That helped.
[95.14 → 95.44] Nice.
[96.56 → 103.24] The show is brought to you today by MSI, Squarespace, and Back blaze, of course, alongside our chair
[103.24 → 104.26] partner, Secret Lab.
[104.52 → 106.34] Let's jump right into our headline topic.
[106.86 → 108.64] Google is a monopoly?
[108.64 → 109.64] On Monday.
[109.64 → 110.32] On Monday.
[110.32 → 116.56] A judge ruled after having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence,
[116.82 → 118.52] the court reaches the following conclusion.
[119.32 → 123.74] Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.
[123.74 → 127.12] It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
[127.12 → 135.02] The 277-page ruling details all the ways that Google has controlled and maintained their control
[135.02 → 138.82] of general search services and search text ads.
[138.82 → 144.70] The court was convinced that Google's default distribution deals with browsers and platforms
[144.70 → 150.06] is its biggest advantage that prevents competitors from having a fighting chance at creating a viable
[150.06 → 150.66] alternative.
[150.66 → 158.00] Regarding Google's approximately $20 billion annual payments to Apple, Judge Mehta,
[158.14 → 161.26] Mehta, well, sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.
[161.52 → 163.54] It's wonderful, and you're doing a great job.
[163.54 → 170.98] The prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google, which presently come at
[170.98 → 176.74] little to no cost to Apple, disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when
[176.74 → 179.72] it otherwise has built the capacity to do so.
[180.48 → 187.04] In 2020, Google conducted a quality degradation study which showed that it would not lose search
[187.04 → 191.22] revenue if they were significantly to reduce the quality of their search product.
[191.22 → 192.96] Imagine that.
[193.04 → 193.42] I'm sorry.
[193.48 → 193.78] I'm sorry.
[193.88 → 195.78] I'm taking a break from the notes.
[196.20 → 197.26] I'm taking a break from the notes.
[197.70 → 198.44] Luke, I know.
[198.50 → 198.90] Isn't that great?
[199.54 → 205.58] Imagine, if you will, conducting an internal study at Flow plane Media, okay?
[206.08 → 215.46] Where you guys kind of went, hmm, if we were to make our product 10% or 20% or 50% crappier,
[217.28 → 218.86] would we lose any revenue?
[218.86 → 227.18] And then reaching the end of that study and going, oh, well, the rational conclusion is
[227.18 → 231.00] we should make the experience crappier because we're not going to lose any revenue.
[231.24 → 239.30] I know that the whole motto, don't be evil and it changing or, you know, whatever thing
[239.30 → 242.98] is not as black and white as their motto is don't be evil, and then they changed it.
[243.00 → 244.18] It's not that simple.
[244.18 → 246.58] But maybe it should be.
[247.40 → 256.56] Maybe Google should go, maybe Google should just, you know, humour the internet lawrists
[256.56 → 262.76] who believe that that was their original motto, and they should bring back the motto and they
[262.76 → 266.44] should just have don't be evil as their guiding star because...
[266.44 → 268.50] Wait, was that not their original motto?
[268.78 → 272.38] I think it was, but then when they changed it, it wasn't that they just, like, got rid of it.
[272.42 → 274.94] It was, like, still part of it in a way or something.
[275.04 → 276.84] It just isn't quite as black and white.
[278.20 → 278.42] Okay.
[278.42 → 285.98] Dude, I have 100% noticed, 100% noticed Google search getting actively worse.
[286.08 → 286.40] Oh, yeah.
[286.98 → 288.62] Pretty much everyone that I know has.
[288.86 → 290.44] Especially over the last few years.
[290.62 → 295.86] So while it doesn't surprise me that the search product has been degraded over the last four
[295.86 → 301.62] years, what does surprise me is they literally did a study and were like, can we do this?
[301.62 → 309.58] Green light, check mark, rubber stamp, it's totally going to be okay because it can't affect
[309.58 → 310.08] our revenue.
[310.76 → 313.84] What kind of short-sighted thinking is this?
[314.62 → 315.94] I just can't, Luke.
[316.02 → 316.72] I can't.
[317.86 → 318.16] Yeah.
[320.68 → 326.36] It's difficult because, like, I don't think you can write regulation to, like, not allow
[326.36 → 327.96] that to happen, but I wish we could.
[328.36 → 330.68] But I don't think it's, like, even possible because then...
[330.68 → 330.86] What do you do?
[330.92 → 332.30] It's called the Sherman Act.
[333.70 → 334.60] Okay, what's the Sherman Act?
[334.80 → 344.08] Well, no, that's basically, like, it addresses, like, monopolistic behaviour, essentially.
[344.30 → 346.14] Okay, but I don't even mean within a monopoly.
[346.58 → 347.58] But that's why.
[347.58 → 348.82] If Russian companies do this at all.
[349.06 → 350.28] That's why they can...
[350.28 → 351.20] Is this why it worked really well here?
[351.24 → 351.54] Yeah.
[352.16 → 353.38] That's why it worked.
[353.60 → 356.88] Because they could just buy their way to their dominant position.
[356.88 → 363.00] They don't actually have to make a better product because they can just make sure that absolutely
[363.00 → 367.08] nobody with any capacity to compete with them will ever exist.
[368.08 → 368.60] Yeah.
[369.00 → 369.56] All right.
[369.60 → 370.38] Our notes go on.
[371.22 → 377.64] Generative AI has not, or at least not yet, eliminated or materially reduced the need for
[377.64 → 380.42] user data to deliver quality search results.
[380.42 → 383.48] So that was one of the other findings.
[385.04 → 390.56] Interestingly, Google was not sanctioned for destroying internal communications, but that
[390.56 → 393.52] was because the judge was already convinced by all the evidence.
[393.62 → 394.22] That's hilarious.
[394.78 → 395.54] Imagine that.
[395.94 → 402.48] Imagine destroying evidence and getting away with it because you didn't destroy nearly enough.
[402.48 → 406.98] I still think they should get in trouble for that regardless.
[408.14 → 412.52] Even if it didn't end up, like, if it didn't matter, it's still a bad move.
[412.70 → 413.64] They should get in trouble for it.
[413.86 → 418.30] But it's like, yeah, you should have, you should have, you know, man.
[418.78 → 419.14] Okay.
[419.20 → 419.58] You know what?
[419.64 → 420.68] No, I was going to get grisly.
[421.88 → 424.46] The ruling is for the liability phase.
[424.46 → 429.66] The next step is appeals for Google and the remedy phase where Judge Mehta can possibly
[429.66 → 432.22] force a breakup of Google.
[432.48 → 438.06] The closest parallel to this case is Microsoft's antitrust trial in 1999.
[438.96 → 444.72] They did successfully appeal, but they reached a settlement preventing them from acting anti-competitively
[444.72 → 445.92] in the browser market.
[446.24 → 447.32] Now, here's my question.
[448.22 → 455.30] How about a settlement that prevents Google from acting anti-competitively in any market
[455.30 → 456.76] they participate in?
[457.28 → 457.84] What do you think?
[457.84 → 462.12] And while we're at it, why don't we, why don't we open the books back up on Microsoft
[462.12 → 464.68] and their recent behaviour in Windows?
[465.30 → 466.40] With AI stuff?
[466.70 → 467.52] Oh, yeah, with Windows?
[467.74 → 467.82] Yeah.
[467.88 → 473.08] Dude, how many times, how many times am I going to be prompted about a Game Pass subscription
[473.08 → 475.48] by my stupid operating system?
[475.48 → 478.56] Why do I have to deal with this?
[478.56 → 483.52] You know that whole thing where it's like, snooze for three days, remind me later, and
[483.52 → 486.78] it makes you go through the setup wizard again, and it prompts you to use Edge again?
[488.36 → 489.04] Have you gone through that?
[489.08 → 490.06] No, I've never had that happen.
[490.08 → 495.76] Have you seen how teams will ignore your default browser setting on your computer?
[495.76 → 497.56] Dude, that was recent.
[497.94 → 498.68] That was recent.
[498.96 → 501.64] Microsoft is 100% back at it.
[502.72 → 507.12] Like, that one is so brazen, so obvious, so clear-cut.
[507.46 → 515.24] They are using their position in the workplace communications market with Teams, which, by the
[515.24 → 521.28] way, they bundle with Office in a way that actually, you could argue, their behaviour with
[521.28 → 523.96] Teams is anti-competitive and monopolistic.
[523.96 → 530.72] So, they leverage their position in Teams to effectively force anyone who isn't going to
[530.72 → 534.94] dig around in the menus to use flipping edge anytime they click a link in Teams.
[535.48 → 541.58] Why would anybody want an application to ignore their default browser?
[541.80 → 545.60] And they clearly knew better because it used your default browser before.
[546.06 → 548.40] This change happened, what, like six months ago or something like that?
[548.48 → 550.18] I don't remember exactly when they changed it.
[550.78 → 553.38] And you can fix it, but most users aren't going to know how.
[553.96 → 558.76] Dude, it was broken on mine for a bit.
[558.82 → 559.78] I literally couldn't.
[560.28 → 561.62] I brought someone into my office.
[561.72 → 562.10] I showed them.
[562.16 → 564.94] They were like, wow, you literally don't have the button that I have.
[565.96 → 567.70] It was unbelievable.
[567.92 → 569.04] It could have just been a bug.
[569.40 → 571.40] My computer was being kind of funky at that time.
[571.46 → 572.36] So, you never know.
[572.48 → 574.50] You can see weird stuff when a computer is unstable.
[574.50 → 579.64] They also, they're simultaneously running old Teams and new Teams right now.
[580.46 → 583.44] So, it might have actually been a problem on one of the versions of Teams.
[583.76 → 583.94] Yep.
[584.10 → 585.14] So, I don't know.
[585.48 → 587.46] Yeah, I think I was using new Teams at that time.
[587.54 → 589.06] But, yeah, I'm not 100% sure.
[589.06 → 593.94] Dude, the fact that this took so long.
[594.62 → 600.28] The fact that so much of this goes just completely under the radar.
[600.42 → 606.00] The fact that we haven't seen a major antitrust case like this since 1999.
[606.00 → 613.34] I've got to say, like, I don't know everything about what the Biden administration has done.
[614.00 → 619.28] I don't know exactly what their role was with making adjustments to the FTC.
[619.68 → 624.18] But I am super liking what the FTC has been doing lately.
[624.60 → 632.18] I am super liking what the U.S. government in general has been doing to address this kind of antitrust and monopolistic behaviour.
[632.42 → 633.94] It's not nearly enough.
[633.94 → 637.62] They could probably 10x their funding for this.
[638.24 → 640.38] And it still wouldn't be enough.
[640.98 → 643.98] But, man, at least it's something.
[644.60 → 645.50] Like, come on.
[645.88 → 647.98] How about Intuit next?
[648.54 → 649.12] Let's go.
[649.96 → 650.60] Let's go.
[650.68 → 652.06] Oh, man, the tax companies.
[652.26 → 653.66] Yeah, that needs to be crushed.
[654.02 → 658.44] It's like North America is like a laughingstock in regard to how taxes work.
[658.56 → 659.94] Dude, 100%.
[659.94 → 662.62] Canada is not the same.
[662.62 → 667.04] Like, American taxes are worse as far as my understanding goes.
[667.26 → 671.40] But we have a lot of the same problems where, like, the government knows exactly how much you owe them.
[672.12 → 674.50] This has been a solved issue for a really long time.
[674.50 → 686.22] But the lobbies of the tax companies are just forcing them to make it so that you have to use these garbage tax companies in order to call your taxes properly, which is really frustrating.
[686.22 → 693.12] Yeah, and how about the TransUnion and whatever the other one is duopoly?
[693.58 → 695.60] How about we get rid of that while we're at it?
[695.76 → 697.82] Like, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[697.82 → 698.34] There's a lot of this stuff.
[698.34 → 703.84] Let's start knocking down some monopolies because it is tiresome.
[704.40 → 705.16] It's tiresome.
[705.26 → 715.34] And I like the whole idea of, like, you could be a monopoly and not get crushed by monopoly law as long as you're not doing certain actions.
[715.34 → 722.58] Like, if Google search was effectively a monopoly because it was just so much better than everything else, that's one thing.
[722.88 → 731.94] If Google search is effectively a monopoly because they spend billions and billions of dollars annually, which no other company can do, to make sure that they're buying their way into being the default search engine on everything,
[732.52 → 735.44] that is, something should happen because of that.
[735.56 → 736.74] That's bad practice monopoly.
[736.74 → 738.76] Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[738.76 → 751.30] And it's just, it's one of those things where it's tough because philosophically, right, the idea of a free market is appealing to me.
[751.38 → 753.92] I mean, I was born in a capitalist country.
[754.18 → 759.66] I generally believe in things competing on their merits, right?
[760.26 → 761.98] But that's the whole thing.
[763.14 → 764.08] This regulation.
[764.40 → 765.02] It should compete on its merit.
[765.02 → 769.94] This regulation doesn't exist to destroy a free market economy.
[770.16 → 775.30] It exists to maintain the integrity of a free market economy.
[776.30 → 787.50] And I think that's what a lot of folks are missing sometimes when they see government regulation come down on the behaviour of companies like this.
[788.78 → 790.52] No, they're not.
[791.10 → 793.88] This isn't a government overreach.
[793.88 → 804.00] This is the government doing its job to give everybody a crack instead of just Google and their executives and their shareholders.
[804.00 → 814.98] Yeah, someone's pointing out in chat, like, didn't Google pay for 81% of Mozilla Foundation to keep Google as the default search?
[815.12 → 817.06] I've heard an even higher percentage than that.
[817.06 → 821.18] And this might actually end up hurting Firefox a lot.
[821.24 → 828.80] But I also think without certain monopolistic practices, Firefox wouldn't be in the rough spot that it is right now.
[828.80 → 830.80] So it's like Google.
[830.80 → 839.58] So it's like Google, like, monopolistic practices are propping up Firefox who never would have needed to be propped up.
[840.02 → 840.46] Yeah.
[840.58 → 842.66] If it wasn't for monopolistic practices.
[843.20 → 843.56] Like, ah!
[843.56 → 845.74] So we can look at it now.
[845.82 → 849.96] We can go, but look at the collateral damage there will be if they don't do these deals anymore.
[850.08 → 851.50] It's like, yeah, you're right.
[851.58 → 852.20] We never should have.
[852.56 → 853.68] This shouldn't happen.
[853.78 → 854.40] That sucks.
[855.08 → 856.48] But we never should have gotten here.
[857.04 → 857.18] Yeah.
[857.26 → 862.50] And we can't just allow it forever because we allowed it for a while, and it's created problems.
[862.50 → 872.96] I mean, it's like the way that they've allowed the it's like the way they've allowed housing prices, the bubble to balloon the way that it has here in Canada, particularly in markets like Vancouver and Toronto.
[873.22 → 878.80] And everyone's looking at it going, well, you can't let the market crash because think of all the people who are over leveraged.
[878.92 → 883.66] It's like, oh my God, at some point it's going to pop.
[883.72 → 888.88] It can either be really, really, really painful or it can be even more painful.
[889.12 → 890.86] Those are the only options now.
[890.86 → 890.94] Wow.
[892.76 → 893.20] Yep.
[894.08 → 895.00] Yeah, it's brutal.
[896.56 → 901.52] And I'm, to be very clear, I'm very worried about what's going to happen with Mozilla Foundation.
[901.88 → 902.64] Yeah, me too.
[902.94 → 904.34] I think this is going to be really rough.
[904.46 → 917.08] I hope, as much as I don't really like Bing that much, I kind of hope Microsoft swoops in and puts some Bing contract in place and pays them a bunch of money to make Bing the default or something.
[917.08 → 917.60] I don't know.
[917.70 → 918.66] But if they do that.
[920.86 → 924.78] Are they engaging in the same practice?
[924.78 → 931.22] Well, my biggest problem with, like, some form of search is going to have to be the default somewhere.
[931.32 → 934.86] In my opinion, I don't have a huge problem with that being a thing that happens.
[935.22 → 938.44] My problem is that Google was all of them.
[938.98 → 940.48] They were all of those contracts.
[940.58 → 942.32] They had that contract with Apple forever.
[942.42 → 943.88] They had the contract with Firefox forever.
[943.98 → 945.50] They had the contract with everyone forever.
[945.58 → 946.58] It was across the board.
[946.98 → 949.56] It wasn't like a few companies are fighting in different arenas.
[949.56 → 951.10] It was Google fights everywhere.
[951.10 → 951.92] And that's it.
[955.10 → 956.00] I don't know.
[956.00 → 959.10] I don't think these kinds of deals will be possible.
[959.34 → 967.82] I mean, there is no way that you can make an argument that Microsoft, other than Microsoft's extremely low market share.
[967.82 → 977.24] So that's where they could make an anti-monopoly argument is, hey, we're a scrappy underdog in this space.
[978.04 → 979.04] They are genuinely, though.
[979.36 → 979.66] Yeah.
[979.72 → 985.28] But they're also, you know, literally one of the top valued companies on the face of the earth.
[985.94 → 986.22] And so.
[986.22 → 990.10] But in that space, they are a massive underdog.
[990.30 → 990.54] Sure.
[990.64 → 991.84] But imagine this, right?
[991.96 → 993.76] Imagine if let's say.
[995.38 → 1006.18] Let's say LV MH or whatever the Louis Vuitton Hermes, whatever that luxury brand Bernard Arnault or whatever his name is.
[1006.18 → 1009.40] OK, I'm trying to pick an extremely valuable company that is not in tech.
[1009.50 → 1010.36] That's that's the point.
[1010.44 → 1012.80] So these are this is an enormous company.
[1012.80 → 1020.56] OK, so if they were all of a sudden to go into a space that is much smaller than they are.
[1021.06 → 1024.30] So let's say a technology You Tubing.
[1025.02 → 1033.94] OK, if their market share in views for that was effectively zero, you know, it was one percent because they started a channel.
[1033.94 → 1040.20] If they were to go around and pay Google a bunch of money to be the first result.
[1040.28 → 1043.40] Anytime anyone searches for any video around tech.
[1044.04 → 1045.74] That is absolutely.
[1048.32 → 1051.76] An anti-competitive behaviour.
[1051.76 → 1060.22] Even if they don't have a dominant position, you can buy advertising, but it has to be on a level playing field.
[1060.22 → 1076.04] And the fact that these are back room deals as opposed to like, OK, if Mozilla, for example, just had a completely open affiliate program, for example, that everyone pays into equally and everyone has an equal shot at.
[1076.28 → 1078.32] Then I think that's a completely different story.
[1078.32 → 1094.82] So if every time you installed Firefox, and it asked you to select your browser, and it was a completely randomized order or not your browser, sorry, search, your default search and all the potential default searches would have a chance of showing up at random.
[1095.24 → 1097.72] And then whoever people click.
[1098.16 → 1098.66] Random order.
[1098.96 → 1099.10] Yeah.
[1099.10 → 1100.20] Not showing up at random.
[1100.46 → 1100.60] Yeah.
[1100.60 → 1101.04] Random order.
[1101.04 → 1109.72] Whoever someone clicks, they have to sort of pay them a commission for being the default browser on that install or something.
[1109.92 → 1113.82] As long as everybody can participate equally, then that's fine.
[1114.06 → 1125.02] But if it's pure pay to win, and it's happening in a way that is not open and is not accessible and nobody else even gets a shot at it, then no, I don't think you can really get away with that.
[1125.02 → 1137.62] What do you do about, so I don't hate the idea, but what do you do about groups like DuckDuckGo, which aren't going to have any money to pay into this affiliate program thing?
[1140.36 → 1142.96] I'm, look, I'm not saying it's a solution.
[1143.20 → 1144.98] Because if you have to exclude them anyway, then no one's paying.
[1145.56 → 1145.84] Yeah.
[1145.94 → 1152.76] And then if no one's paying, then there's no, like the community funding for Mozilla is like practically nothing.
[1152.76 → 1154.86] People don't contribute to free software.
[1155.08 → 1156.30] It's basically a joke.
[1157.20 → 1160.40] Like it happens, but it's enough to like buy developers coffee.
[1160.58 → 1163.72] It's not enough to actually properly support people.
[1166.48 → 1167.74] I don't know.
[1167.86 → 1169.58] I don't know the answers to this.
[1169.68 → 1176.96] I'm just saying that, you know, Microsoft buying Bing default is not the answer.
[1176.96 → 1184.24] Because the way that it is supposed to work is products are supposed to compete on their merit.
[1186.24 → 1190.62] And buying your position is not competing on your merit.
[1191.36 → 1200.88] Buying advertising space that is clearly delineated as such, totally fair game.
[1200.88 → 1202.88] But buying...
[1202.88 → 1204.18] I get all that, and I don't disagree.
[1204.42 → 1211.38] I think what I keep getting stuck on is like, how do we allow groups like Mozilla to monetize things?
[1214.02 → 1218.96] Because if it's the setup you're saying, no one pays.
[1219.22 → 1219.52] I know.
[1219.62 → 1221.32] Well, no, no, I'm not pitching that setup.
[1221.38 → 1222.34] I want to make that very clear.
[1222.42 → 1224.88] I was just trying to pitch something that could be more fair.
[1224.88 → 1230.46] And like, look, I don't have good answers.
[1230.62 → 1231.98] I have unpopular answers.
[1233.12 → 1234.84] People might have to buy Firefox.
[1237.58 → 1245.00] And realistically, if that were the case, we might be in a position where, you know what?
[1245.98 → 1248.48] Microsoft might not be allowed to give Edgeways for free.
[1249.04 → 1251.04] Google might not be allowed to give Edgeways for free.
[1251.04 → 1254.30] I mean, that is the point of breaking up companies.
[1254.30 → 1269.94] If Google gets broken up and Google Chrome becomes a company, the whole idea behind that is that Google Chrome, Inc., is going to have to compete against other browsers on its own merit.
[1270.44 → 1276.50] It doesn't get to just have a special data sharing deal with Big Daddy Alphabet.
[1277.18 → 1281.76] And it doesn't get to receive, but it would have to offer the same deal to everyone.
[1282.42 → 1283.06] Would it?
[1283.64 → 1283.94] Yeah.
[1284.30 → 1285.42] That's the whole idea.
[1286.08 → 1289.28] You don't have to offer equal deals to other companies as a company.
[1289.28 → 1300.30] If they didn't, though, given the scrutiny that Google and Alphabet are under here, I think they would find themselves in court again immediately, essentially.
[1300.70 → 1306.00] Like them basically claiming that they're acting as a combined group of companies.
[1306.12 → 1306.64] Exactly.
[1306.88 → 1308.30] You guys have not...
[1308.30 → 1311.06] I have no idea what the laws around that are, but I'm sure that's a thing.
[1311.28 → 1316.72] You would have to demonstrate that in good faith you attempted to negotiate with other parties.
[1316.72 → 1316.78] Yeah.
[1317.22 → 1317.36] Right?
[1317.42 → 1317.56] Yeah.
[1317.56 → 1318.56] That's the whole idea of a breakup.
[1318.56 → 1320.60] That's the whole idea of a breakup.
[1320.60 → 1342.22] Is that instead of Firefox going up against browsers that are funded by all the data that they are stealing from their users and feeding back into their parent companies and that are then paying into them in order to continue to collect, they would be going up against browsers that, well, are still going to be stealing a bunch of data, but are selling it to everybody.
[1342.22 → 1343.22] Yeah.
[1343.22 → 1344.22] Yeah.
[1344.22 → 1346.22] And that's the bottom line.
[1346.22 → 1347.22] I'd buy Firefox.
[1347.22 → 1349.22] Is that you'd probably just have to...
[1349.22 → 1353.22] You either buy the product or you are the product.
[1353.22 → 1354.22] Yeah.
[1354.22 → 1356.22] Which is why I would buy Firefox.
[1356.22 → 1363.22] Because at the end of the day, we look at something like Firefox as an alternative to being the product, but we're not really.
[1363.22 → 1364.22] It's all the same groups.
[1364.22 → 1366.22] It's just a different label on it.
[1366.22 → 1368.22] It's the same groups funding it, right?
[1368.22 → 1369.22] Yeah.
[1369.22 → 1370.22] Yeah.
[1370.22 → 1376.22] And so it's all feeding into that machine until we break the cycle.
[1376.22 → 1378.22] So I don't know.
[1378.22 → 1383.22] I'm looking at this as a win, but I'm also looking at it as...
[1383.22 → 1384.22] There's going to be pain.
[1384.22 → 1392.22] A tiny first step in what is going to be an extremely painful breakup.
[1392.22 → 1404.22] Because people think that they support the small, independent, the real free market.
[1404.22 → 1411.22] They think that they support groups that are doing things the right way, respecting their privacy and their data.
[1411.22 → 1426.22] But when all of a sudden they are faced with the cost of buying what they were getting for just data, I think there's going to be sticker shock, Luke.
[1426.22 → 1427.22] Yeah.
[1427.22 → 1428.22] Yeah, for sure.
[1428.22 → 1430.22] People often talk about how expensive float plane is.
[1430.22 → 1434.22] Oh, I don't want to pay $5 for one creator.
[1434.22 → 1438.22] Guys, the margins aren't that crazy for us on float plane.
[1438.22 → 1443.22] And yeah, we operate at a much smaller scale compared to someone like Google, for example, does.
[1443.22 → 1444.22] And so our costs are higher.
[1444.22 → 1446.22] And the value does get better as you scale.
[1446.22 → 1447.22] Yes.
[1447.22 → 1448.22] A lot better.
[1448.22 → 1449.22] We're going to have economies of scale.
[1449.22 → 1468.22] But a platform like the one you're watching on right now, whether you're on Twitch, which is being just money furnished by Amazon, or whether you're on YouTube, which we think may be profitable by now, but absolutely was money furnished by Google for many years.
[1468.22 → 1472.22] They're so expensive to run.
[1472.22 → 1475.22] Video is shockingly expensive.
[1475.22 → 1500.22] And I think we're just, I think we're just going to realize collectively, holy crap, that, that reality, that dystopian reality, where everything about us, you know, from the, the food we eat to our, our weird kinks to the family members that we're related to everything about us is being collected and used against us.
[1500.22 → 1510.22] So, um, I think there's going to be people that are going to look back at that and go, yeah, the grass was greener compared to pulling out my wallet and paying $3 a month for a web browser.
[1510.22 → 1513.22] Oh yeah, man.
[1513.22 → 1515.22] You know, it's going to be a subscription, baby.
[1515.22 → 1516.22] Oh yeah.
[1516.22 → 1517.22] It has to be.
[1517.22 → 1520.22] When you said by Firefox, I was like, all right, like lifetime.
[1520.22 → 1521.22] That's not how it works.
[1521.22 → 1522.22] Yep.
[1522.22 → 1523.22] Yep.
[1523.22 → 1527.22] You have to, the buy once model is dead Luke.
[1527.22 → 1528.22] Yeah.
[1528.22 → 1529.22] Because companies.
[1529.22 → 1531.22] The services that have to be maintained.
[1531.22 → 1533.22] It, it makes sense that it is dead, but it's just like.
[1533.22 → 1541.22] And when, and when the internet and when computing was growing at an exponential rate, you could sell it once.
[1541.22 → 1549.22] And then when your user base is twice the size 18 months from now, you could, you, you could sell everything you'd ever sold.
[1549.22 → 1555.22] You could sell it again in the next 18 months and, and it would keep growing, and it was all going to rocket ship to the moon, but it all busted.
[1555.22 → 1557.22] It all has to bust.
[1557.22 → 1564.22] Eventually there's a finite number of people and a finite number of dollars, a finite amount of value that you can extract.
[1564.22 → 1570.22] And if the market size isn't growing, well then you have to grow the amount of money that you're extracting from the market.
[1570.22 → 1572.22] It's all going to be subscriptions.
[1572.22 → 1574.22] Everyone already has a phone.
[1574.22 → 1575.22] You can't just.
[1575.22 → 1576.22] You know what would be a cool product?
[1576.22 → 1577.22] Yeah.
[1577.22 → 1578.22] From Stripe.
[1578.22 → 1579.22] There's not going to be another India moment.
[1579.22 → 1580.22] Hold on.
[1580.22 → 1581.22] That's the last point I want to make.
[1581.22 → 1585.22] There's not going to be another India moment in the world ever.
[1585.22 → 1586.22] Like.
[1586.22 → 1587.22] India comes online.
[1587.22 → 1589.22] When India went online.
[1589.22 → 1591.22] My goodness.
[1591.22 → 1593.22] Did it happen practically overnight.
[1593.22 → 1595.22] I forget what the carrier was.
[1595.22 → 1600.22] But they basically, a value carrier launched in India for the first time.
[1600.22 → 1609.22] And it happened right at this intersection moment when smartphone prices reached attainable for the first time.
[1609.22 → 1615.22] And a country of over a billion people just came onto the internet.
[1615.22 → 1618.22] And there was explosive growth in all these areas.
[1618.22 → 1622.22] Where's the next market that's going to do that?
[1622.22 → 1626.22] Birth rates are falling across the vast majority of the developed world.
[1626.22 → 1630.22] Pretty much every country is connected, at least to a very significant degree.
[1630.22 → 1637.22] I mean, we're still we're still going to see growth in from Africa, for example, but it's not going to be like that.
[1637.22 → 1639.22] Sorry. Okay, go ahead.
[1639.22 → 1650.22] No, I've been having a decent amount of conversations with people at this event already about payments processing and Stripe and PayPal.
[1650.22 → 1654.22] And a pretty interesting product that Stripe could make.
[1654.22 → 1659.22] I don't think they would actually want to because they'd lose out on one of their probably the biggest revenue streams.
[1659.22 → 1663.22] But it would be cool, in my opinion, as we're getting to more and more subscriptions.
[1663.22 → 1674.22] One of the most annoying things to me is not necessarily the cost per month, but it's the just genuine volume of subscriptions and payments that are coming through.
[1674.22 → 1680.22] So one of the conversations that we've had is the benefit of bundling payments.
[1680.22 → 1690.22] So if you have like if you have a certain platform that has multiple subscriptions on it, paying for all of those subscriptions on that one platform at the same time.
[1690.22 → 1703.22] So if you're a patron or a float plane or something like that, if all the payments go through at once, how these payment processors do their fees is it's generally a percentage plus a fixed cost for every transaction.
[1703.22 → 1711.22] Yep. So most like North American or most American really transactions are 2.9% plus 30 cents unless you have some negotiated rate.
[1711.22 → 1715.22] But most people I've seen fixed rates as low as like 15 cents.
[1715.22 → 1719.22] I think like it depends. Yeah, there's like there's there are different models that you can use.
[1719.22 → 1726.22] There's like particular microtransaction models that you can use through Stripe where the got it or the numbers a little bit different.
[1726.22 → 1731.22] It shifts that a standard transaction is 2.9% plus 30 cents.
[1731.22 → 1734.22] Got it. But there is no better than me. So yeah, go ahead.
[1734.22 → 1743.22] But if you so that 30 cents is where a lot of people can save a ton of money because I mean if you're doing 10 million transactions in a month.
[1743.22 → 1747.22] 30 cents is 3 million bucks. Let's go every month.
[1747.22 → 1760.22] Yeah. So you're looking at 36 million dollars a year. So if you can is you can bundle like if one user has three subscriptions, if you can bundle into that into one payment, you're saving 60 cents, 60 cents a month on that user.
[1760.22 → 1765.22] Yeah. So it'd be kind of neat. If Stripe as a platform, if you instead of having like, you would need accounts on both. But if you had like almost like payment by Stripe in the way that you have like Apple Pay and Google Pay, and then Stripe bundles
[1765.22 → 1768.22] all your payments into one big payment.
[1768.22 → 1778.22] They have zero interest in doing that. They have no incentive in doing that. But it would be so good for me. Like if I could just go to Stripe and on Stripe see all of my subscriptions.
[1778.22 → 1791.22] Yep. So it's all nicely laid out in one spot. I could cancel subscriptions right through there. And then it just came out in one big payment every month. That would be sick. That would be super cool.
[1791.22 → 1820.22] I think the only entity that could probably do that would be like a major American bank. Because realistically, part of that the handling fee that the transaction fee that they're dealing with is not just collecting the money from the bank, but it's not just collecting the money from the bank.
[1820.22 → 1833.22] Collecting the money from you, but also routing it to where it needs to go. So by combining them, yes, they're only doing the one payment from you, but they still need to split everything out to all the different end destinations.
[1833.22 → 1849.40] So it would have to be a cooperative effort between like a group, probably even of the big banks where they all go, okay, we're not going to charge each other anything to do these interbank transfers.
[1849.40 → 1864.14] And we're going to absorb the ones that go outside the network in order to do this, like this sort of subscription bundling and save. Oh, shoot. Wait, save. We're the ones who collect this revenue. Crap. No, we're just not going to do this.
[1864.14 → 1880.64] Like the only kind of market where I could see something like that happening, because you're absolutely right. That is how it should probably work. The only market where I could see something like that happening would be somewhere like China, for example, where it's dictated by the central government.
[1880.64 → 1887.52] And these entities are only sort of people on the head and be like, hey, stop wasting money.
[1888.06 → 1902.30] Essentially. Yeah. Yeah. And some people pointed out in chat that this is a thing. I know this is a thing on the platform level. Flow plane does it. What I'm saying is, does I wish this was a thing on the payment processor level.
[1902.30 → 1907.22] Yeah. So if you like followed, let's say, let's say you didn't know that Dank Pods was on Flow plane.
[1907.64 → 1925.08] If you followed Dank Pods on Patreon and you followed LTT on Flow plane and both Patreon and Flow plane used Stripe as a payment processor, then essentially we could, we could say we could opt into this program.
[1925.08 → 1935.60] And then Stripe on the back end would take one payment from you for that month, and it would divvy it out to the two different platforms for your two separate subscriptions. That's what Luke is pitching.
[1936.34 → 1950.56] Yeah. I think that would be really cool, personally. And like some people have asked how that would work because if people subscribe at different times, there's this whole math you could do to figure out pro rata to adjust for that and Ada, Ada, Ada. It's definitely possible.
[1950.56 → 1967.26] So like I said, we, we do it already. I would just like it to be done on the payment processor end, but I, I think there definitely isn't a per transaction financial incentive for Stripe to do this, but I do think it could be a good market.
[1970.26 → 1977.50] Like getting more customers' thing, because that would make me prefer to use whatever platform did this over anything else personally.
[1977.50 → 1986.42] Oh, Wade actually shut down his Patreon like seven months ago. So, all right. He's all Flow plane all the time. Heck yeah. Let's go, Wade.
[1987.14 → 1988.02] Oh, Wade, you didn't know that?
[1988.32 → 1993.56] No, no, I totally didn't know that. I didn't know he shut it down. I knew that he, I knew he was going to.
[1994.36 → 1994.98] Oh, okay.
[1995.18 → 1996.54] But I didn't know he pulled the trigger. Yep.
[1996.82 → 1997.38] That makes sense.
[1997.70 → 1998.40] What a Chad.
[1999.36 → 1999.68] Yep.
[1999.68 → 2007.90] We were, we were discussing creators who haven't had controversy, um, prior to the show on, on, on the pre-show.
[2008.14 → 2011.42] Uh, as, as far as I know, I don't think Wade's ever had any controversy.
[2011.88 → 2015.30] Every time I've hung out with him, he just seems like, just seems like an upright dude.
[2015.40 → 2016.28] He's super chill, dude.
[2016.58 → 2021.44] You know, for someone who's upside down, you know, he sure does manage to have his head screwed on straight.
[2022.72 → 2023.08] Wow.
[2023.70 → 2025.68] Australian. Australian. He's not upside down.
[2025.82 → 2026.94] I'm going to just calm down all.
[2026.94 → 2039.14] All right. So anyway, um, one of the things I asked the, uh, the prep team to put together was some examples of other monopolies that haven't gotten their comeuppance yet.
[2039.90 → 2044.42] Um, and, uh, they put together, uh, Google themselves in September.
[2044.68 → 2048.16] So this was, uh, over digital ads.
[2048.28 → 2048.62] Okay.
[2049.18 → 2052.20] Um, Meta. Oh, wait, they're getting sued by the FTC.
[2052.90 → 2055.72] Amazon. Oh, wait, they're getting sued by the FTC.
[2055.72 → 2059.04] Apple. Oh, wait, they're getting sued by the DOJ.
[2059.62 → 2062.74] Um, and Microsoft and Amazon backdooring AI startups.
[2062.84 → 2063.58] There's a bunch of stuff.
[2063.66 → 2083.14] Actually, NVIDIA is getting investigated finally for some of the just like everyone has known forever that doing a deal with NVIDIA is like dealing with a very difficult entity that understands fully the dominance they have.
[2083.14 → 2086.00] Have they ever crossed the line?
[2086.44 → 2089.20] Hey, we're finally looking into that.
[2090.46 → 2091.36] Very interesting.
[2091.68 → 2093.10] I am so happy to see it.
[2093.18 → 2094.56] I want to see so much more.
[2094.56 → 2104.86] Whatever incoming administration we see in the U.S. come the November elections, you personally, I'm talking to our American viewers out there.
[2105.22 → 2111.08] You personally need to be putting pressure on your representatives to keep this train going.
[2111.08 → 2112.56] This matters a lot.
[2112.94 → 2118.30] It is costing you money all the time, both directly and through tax dollars.
[2118.52 → 2119.92] This is costing you money.
[2119.92 → 2129.26] And these investigations, as long as they can get cash settlements, should be a gravy train that will pay for itself for a very long time.
[2129.36 → 2130.12] There's a lot, baby.
[2130.22 → 2131.40] There's lots to investigate.
[2132.04 → 2132.58] Let's go.
[2134.08 → 2134.68] All right.
[2135.58 → 2136.88] What else we got today, Luke?
[2136.90 → 2137.90] What do you want to talk about?
[2138.78 → 2140.02] Should we just go right into the next one?
[2140.08 → 2141.12] The YouTube thing?
[2141.46 → 2141.74] Yeah.
[2142.12 → 2142.50] All right.
[2142.56 → 2142.98] Let's do it.
[2142.98 → 2145.88] YouTube is testing Twitter-issue notes.
[2146.34 → 2153.02] YouTube has announced that they are testing an experimental feature that will allow users to add notes to videos akin to the community notes feature on Twitter.
[2153.30 → 2159.00] The goal of the feature is to provide context and other relevant information that may not be included in the video.
[2159.00 → 2167.18] In their example, they've used a video about extinct animals with a note that says that one of the species was recently discovered to still be alive.
[2167.18 → 2179.00] The notes will appear under the video title where we can see other labels for helpful things like COVID-19 information and will be rated by the community as helpful or somewhat helpful or unhelpful.
[2179.50 → 2182.86] Currently, the ability to write notes is by invitation only.
[2183.08 → 2188.94] And during the pilot, notes will be reviewed by third-party evaluators rather than the note creators.
[2189.16 → 2190.66] Oh, what just happened?
[2190.90 → 2193.22] Rather than the note creators or the community at large.
[2193.22 → 2199.44] There's a discussion question here that says, how well do community notes work on Twitter?
[2199.58 → 2201.92] Do you find that they are accurate and unbiased?
[2202.60 → 2206.52] I have not found that they are completely accurate and unbiased.
[2206.52 → 2206.82] Yeah.
[2207.30 → 2211.42] However, they are a lot better than not having them.
[2212.16 → 2212.34] Yeah.
[2212.72 → 2216.26] I think overall they're helpful, but they have problems.
[2216.26 → 2227.76] One thing that I would like YouTube to consider in all of this, and I haven't spoken with them directly, so this will be the first anyone from YouTube is hearing about it from me.
[2228.22 → 2241.24] But one thing that I would like to see addressed is right now, the creator themselves doesn't have a ton of ways to address anything about the video that they want to clarify after the fact.
[2241.24 → 2255.28] We used to have the ability to put text annotations at a given timestamp in a given spot on the video so that we could issue a small correction, say for a data point on a graph, or say for something that changed after the fact.
[2255.36 → 2261.00] Like if we said, oh yeah, the power consumption of this isn't very good, but there's a BIOS update that went up three days after we published our video.
[2261.42 → 2264.68] We could put an annotation in there and say, hey, this is something that they've addressed.
[2264.68 → 2273.06] It was a great way for us to deal with the constantly changing landscape that is the technology space that we cover.
[2274.08 → 2286.06] And at times it was even a great way to deal with sponsors, for example, because if there was a temporary deal, we could have an annotation that said how much the discount was, and then that could go away when they didn't have it anymore and stuff like that.
[2286.06 → 2289.78] It was a way to keep the content of the video up to date.
[2289.84 → 2292.02] Not well, but it was something.
[2292.02 → 2301.24] They took that away under the guise of trying to make the mobile experience better and more streamlined or something like that.
[2301.38 → 2304.48] It was horsed plop then.
[2304.58 → 2305.52] It's horse plop now.
[2305.58 → 2306.86] It was never anything to do with that.
[2306.92 → 2309.52] And it was everything to do with that they didn't want to do it anymore.
[2310.08 → 2312.50] And they had good reasons for not wanting to do it.
[2312.70 → 2314.88] Some creators did abuse the feature.
[2314.88 → 2317.84] Plain and simple.
[2318.80 → 2323.88] Whether it was through spam or trying to get people to accidentally, you could interact with them.
[2324.14 → 2327.70] So trying to get people to accidentally touch them and skip to certain parts of the video.
[2327.84 → 2330.32] It was definitely an abuse vector.
[2331.32 → 2333.02] But I do think they could have solved it.
[2333.08 → 2335.48] And I think just getting rid of it outright was not the solution.
[2335.62 → 2338.06] Right now, we do have the ability to pin a comment.
[2338.06 → 2343.44] We do have the ability to heart comments or heart our replies.
[2343.94 → 2346.28] But hearts are super inconsistent.
[2346.74 → 2353.86] Like I'll see someone asking a question that like one in every three people in the video is asking a question about that.
[2353.86 → 2363.36] And what I would like to be able to do is heart that comment, reply, heart my own reply, and have that be the first thing people see so they don't need to keep scrolling and ask the same bloody question.
[2363.44 → 2365.98] But it absolutely doesn't work that way.
[2366.32 → 2367.64] Not for me, not for anyone.
[2367.76 → 2373.08] As far as I can tell, everyone's algorithm for what comments get served to them is a little bit different.
[2373.60 → 2378.04] And you can have a comment that has, you know, 6,000 upvotes or something like that.
[2378.08 → 2380.42] And is hearted by the creator and has a reply from the creator.
[2380.42 → 2384.76] And it'll decay, which a decay algorithm is perfectly reasonable.
[2385.00 → 2389.20] But it'll decay to the point where you can't even find it at all after a little while.
[2389.32 → 2396.78] And you'll just be kind of perpetuating the same comments over and over and over again because people can't see that this has already been discussed.
[2396.92 → 2397.76] It's already been addressed.
[2401.28 → 2405.46] So anyway, where I was going with this is if we're going to have a community notes feature,
[2405.46 → 2412.06] giving the creator the ability to address the community note, I feel is extremely important.
[2412.68 → 2415.38] I don't see any obvious way to do that right now.
[2415.86 → 2422.48] But I would like to have the possibility for it to be a conversation.
[2422.48 → 2434.80] I think it's important for people to understand that community notes are not the solution to misinformation and are a form of misinformation themselves.
[2434.80 → 2437.90] But they can help reduce misinformation overall.
[2438.50 → 2444.40] I know people that have put out tweets, had a community note attempt to correct their tweet,
[2444.70 → 2447.06] had the community note stay for close to 24 hours.
[2447.06 → 2451.10] And then the community note eventually is removed because the community note was wrong.
[2451.60 → 2460.62] But in that 24-hour period, the community note, because some amount of people have grown to trust community notes,
[2461.50 → 2467.06] that community note was a fairly strong source of misinformation because people read it and then...
[2467.90 → 2472.06] Nobody's going to go back and look at it a couple of days later and find out that they were...
[2472.06 → 2472.54] Yeah.
[2472.54 → 2480.28] So it's important to keep in mind that it doesn't automatically mean that the note is true.
[2480.80 → 2485.72] And you have to realistically question everything if you want to be actually certain.
[2488.72 → 2492.70] Will this cause the same problem the dislike button supposedly did?
[2492.84 → 2497.32] I think it'll create a way significantly bigger problem than the dislike button did.
[2497.32 → 2502.58] But I don't really...
[2502.58 → 2506.76] I'm still not convinced that's the actual reason why YouTube took the dislike button down.
[2506.88 → 2508.14] So I doubt they actually care.
[2508.42 → 2513.88] No, the dislike button thing was, as far as I can tell, a purely ideological move.
[2513.94 → 2517.02] It had nothing to do with an objective reason to remove the dislike button.
[2517.68 → 2523.28] I have never, never in my many conversations about it seen any real evidence.
[2523.28 → 2531.72] I've seen, or I've heard compelling arguments that removing the dislike button didn't materially hurt watch time,
[2531.78 → 2533.00] or it didn't do this, or it didn't do that.
[2533.16 → 2539.94] I have never seen evidence that it improved the experience of using the platform in any way.
[2540.72 → 2541.92] There's like no way it did.
[2543.22 → 2543.66] Yep.
[2543.66 → 2547.44] All right.
[2547.52 → 2549.32] Well, hey, good luck.
[2550.94 → 2551.96] Community notes.
[2552.34 → 2552.94] I...
[2552.94 → 2555.94] I don't know, man.
[2556.00 → 2557.72] There was a time when I...
[2557.72 → 2559.98] When YouTube kind of...
[2559.98 → 2561.98] I would say...
[2561.98 → 2565.88] Had kind of earned my sort of mostly trust,
[2565.88 → 2570.94] at least as far as I can trust a big tech conglomerate to do the right thing.
[2570.94 → 2573.78] Um, I'd say they still...
[2573.78 → 2576.94] I think they still get it right more often than they get it wrong,
[2577.06 → 2580.30] but they've really eroded a lot of that trust,
[2580.86 → 2582.82] especially over the last few years.
[2584.80 → 2585.28] Yep.
[2586.74 → 2588.52] I mean, Google in general, man.
[2589.56 → 2591.22] Google's like...
[2591.22 → 2591.98] Google's rough.
[2593.90 → 2594.34] Yeah.
[2594.64 → 2597.46] If you use something that's made by Google and you like it,
[2597.46 → 2600.34] you like to have to have a backup plan at this point
[2600.34 → 2602.30] because they might just remove it at any time
[2602.30 → 2604.88] for probably not a very good reason.
[2606.32 → 2606.72] Um,
[2606.84 → 2610.32] a lot of their tools have not really been advancing very significantly.
[2611.16 → 2611.60] Um,
[2611.92 → 2612.52] they...
[2612.52 → 2615.82] They are retaining their market share through spending dollars
[2615.82 → 2617.18] instead of making better products.
[2617.34 → 2618.46] Like it's...
[2619.46 → 2621.72] I don't know.
[2624.46 → 2624.90] Yeah.
[2624.90 → 2625.10] Cool.
[2625.24 → 2625.52] It's rough.
[2626.02 → 2627.06] What are we supposed to be doing, Dan?
[2627.06 → 2628.62] Oh,
[2628.80 → 2629.40] merch messages.
[2630.02 → 2630.32] Hey,
[2630.72 → 2631.82] if you're new to the show,
[2631.94 → 2634.70] you may not be familiar with the concept of merch messages.
[2634.82 → 2636.06] We don't do Twitch bits.
[2636.18 → 2637.88] We don't do super chats.
[2637.96 → 2638.94] We do merch messages
[2638.94 → 2640.82] so that any contribution to the show
[2640.82 → 2641.90] goes to us,
[2642.02 → 2643.72] goes to our creator warehouse team,
[2644.06 → 2645.18] goes to our suppliers,
[2645.46 → 2647.52] goes to our warehousing partner,
[2647.64 → 2648.22] MBC,
[2648.86 → 2651.64] goes to our team to build great products
[2651.64 → 2652.76] like the LTT screwdriver,
[2653.44 → 2654.50] the scribe driver,
[2654.68 → 2655.60] our water bottles,
[2655.60 → 2657.76] all that good stuff that you guys know and love.
[2657.76 → 2661.02] And the best part is that unlike just throwing money at the screen,
[2661.02 → 2662.20] like some of those other methods,
[2662.36 → 2663.82] you can throw money at your screen
[2663.82 → 2666.50] and also get great products in the mail.
[2666.50 → 2672.00] We're going to show you guys how it works in just a moment,
[2672.00 → 2673.92] but I'm pretty sure there was something else I was going to say.
[2674.02 → 2674.30] Oh, right.
[2674.32 → 2675.22] How to send a merch message.
[2675.48 → 2677.64] All you got to do is go to LTTstore.com,
[2677.74 → 2678.80] add something to your cart,
[2678.92 → 2679.78] and when we're live,
[2679.84 → 2681.98] you're going to see a box to send a merch message,
[2682.04 → 2683.70] and it'll go to producer Dan,
[2683.84 → 2686.30] who will pop it up at the bottom of the screen,
[2686.42 → 2687.64] who will reply to it himself,
[2687.72 → 2689.62] who will forward it to someone who can answer your question,
[2689.70 → 2693.48] or who will curate it for me and Luke to address.
[2693.48 → 2696.80] All right, Dan, why don't you show us how merch messages work?
[2697.12 → 2697.26] Sure.
[2697.38 → 2699.28] I've got a question here from Jason.
[2699.92 → 2703.04] Linus, why do you want AMD to create lower-end chips,
[2703.24 → 2704.44] manufactured e-waste,
[2704.58 → 2706.70] instead of promoting using older hardware?
[2708.24 → 2710.00] Ah, that's a good question.
[2710.48 → 2715.38] I do not want people to stop using older hardware,
[2715.38 → 2722.44] but what you've got to understand is that not everybody is comfortable buying a second-hand processor.
[2723.28 → 2727.02] So, while I have advocated many times,
[2727.50 → 2730.88] like to the point where it's almost probably exhausting
[2730.88 → 2734.40] how many times I have advocated for buying used hardware,
[2734.60 → 2736.28] rather than brand-new hardware,
[2736.42 → 2738.06] especially if you're on a tight budget,
[2738.06 → 2742.56] I know and accept and fully understand
[2742.56 → 2745.90] that some people are just never going to do that.
[2746.30 → 2749.02] And so, the reason that I'm going after AMD
[2749.02 → 2753.06] for the fact that they haven't launched a Ry zen 3 processor in like...
[2754.62 → 2755.32] three years?
[2755.74 → 2756.62] four years?
[2757.14 → 2757.82] years!
[2758.38 → 2764.46] They haven't launched a budget gaming processor in many years
[2764.46 → 2767.32] is that the way I feel like
[2767.32 → 2769.42] they have essentially gone
[2769.42 → 2773.26] complacent leader
[2773.26 → 2776.64] and figured,
[2777.06 → 2777.30] well,
[2777.52 → 2780.88] if we can only produce
[2780.88 → 2782.54] so much silicon,
[2783.00 → 2785.38] why do we have to give any
[2785.38 → 2787.42] of the most newfangled,
[2787.90 → 2788.74] power-efficient,
[2789.24 → 2790.30] performant chips
[2790.30 → 2792.04] to the people who only have
[2792.04 → 2793.88] 120 bucks to spend
[2793.88 → 2795.20] when we can just take
[2795.20 → 2796.58] all of that allocation
[2796.58 → 2797.96] and put it into
[2797.96 → 2798.34] Epic
[2798.34 → 2800.58] and Ry zen 9
[2800.58 → 2801.62] and
[2801.62 → 2803.44] Strip Point laptops?
[2806.22 → 2808.84] And that wasn't AMD's attitude before.
[2809.60 → 2810.20] And I just,
[2810.30 → 2810.62] I don't know,
[2810.70 → 2811.34] I get frustrated
[2811.34 → 2812.38] when I see people
[2812.38 → 2813.32] treat AMD
[2813.32 → 2814.46] like they're some kind of
[2814.46 → 2815.20] golden child,
[2815.36 → 2816.54] scrappy underdog
[2816.54 → 2817.34] who is, you know,
[2817.40 → 2818.58] pro-consumer or whatever
[2818.58 → 2819.22] because
[2819.22 → 2820.92] look at what AMD did
[2820.92 → 2821.94] with Ry zen
[2821.94 → 2823.36] where you could buy
[2823.36 → 2824.04] a Thread ripper
[2824.04 → 2824.62] for,
[2825.30 → 2826.02] man,
[2826.08 → 2827.22] I forget what the starting price
[2827.22 → 2828.14] for the Thread ripper
[2828.14 → 2830.68] 1900X was.
[2831.16 → 2831.66] Thread ripper,
[2831.82 → 2832.32] here, hold on,
[2832.38 → 2833.44] I want to check this.
[2833.82 → 2835.50] Thread ripper 1900X
[2835.50 → 2837.48] MSRP launch,
[2837.72 → 2837.94] okay,
[2838.06 → 2838.52] what was it?
[2839.28 → 2839.68] $549.
[2840.28 → 2841.82] For $549
[2841.82 → 2844.46] when AMD was actually scrappy,
[2844.58 → 2846.22] when they were coming from behind,
[2846.22 → 2849.48] for less than the price
[2849.48 → 2850.70] of a current
[2850.70 → 2852.04] Thread ripper Pro
[2852.04 → 2853.00] motherboard,
[2854.04 → 2854.34] okay?
[2855.42 → 2855.88] Seriously,
[2856.44 → 2857.52] flagship Thread ripper Pro
[2857.52 → 2857.94] motherboards
[2857.94 → 2859.34] are like $1,000 plus.
[2859.76 → 2860.66] You could have gotten
[2860.66 → 2861.64] a Thread ripper chip
[2861.64 → 2862.78] and a board.
[2862.96 → 2864.44] That wasn't that long ago.
[2864.54 → 2865.76] That was in 2017.
[2867.02 → 2867.52] So,
[2867.68 → 2868.70] what frustrates me
[2868.70 → 2869.60] is that
[2869.60 → 2870.16] AMD
[2870.16 → 2871.44] used to
[2871.44 → 2871.96] still,
[2872.30 → 2873.46] they used to give you
[2873.46 → 2874.00] the option
[2874.00 → 2874.90] to buy
[2874.90 → 2876.12] a last-gen
[2876.12 → 2876.80] processor
[2876.80 → 2877.26] with
[2877.26 → 2878.96] probably more cores,
[2879.28 → 2879.56] okay?
[2880.16 → 2881.14] But you're also
[2881.14 → 2881.92] going to save some money
[2881.92 → 2882.68] on the platform.
[2883.02 → 2883.60] Or,
[2883.78 → 2884.34] you could buy
[2884.34 → 2885.16] a current-gen
[2885.16 → 2885.70] processor
[2885.70 → 2887.24] at a lower price,
[2887.60 → 2889.10] get more up-to-date
[2889.10 → 2889.58] cores,
[2889.80 → 2890.48] so you'd be getting
[2890.48 → 2891.64] the latest architecture.
[2892.48 → 2893.08] You probably,
[2893.28 → 2893.92] it probably wouldn't
[2893.92 → 2894.66] perform as well
[2894.66 → 2895.56] in Cine bench
[2895.56 → 2896.80] or even real-world
[2896.80 → 2897.36] applications
[2897.36 → 2899.08] that more people use
[2899.08 → 2900.10] like video editing
[2900.10 → 2901.02] or video encoding.
[2901.48 → 2902.26] But it would have
[2902.26 → 2903.44] a greater upgrade path.
[2904.12 → 2904.32] So,
[2904.68 → 2905.74] AMD does do
[2905.74 → 2906.62] some things right.
[2906.74 → 2907.14] The fact that
[2907.14 → 2907.72] they're continuing
[2907.72 → 2908.72] to provide processors
[2908.72 → 2909.56] for AM4
[2909.56 → 2910.68] is perfect.
[2910.76 → 2911.44] They just launched
[2911.44 → 2912.04] new chips.
[2912.14 → 2912.72] That's absolutely
[2912.72 → 2913.32] incredible
[2913.32 → 2914.36] how long they've
[2914.36 → 2915.28] supported that platform
[2915.28 → 2915.70] for.
[2916.10 → 2917.04] But what isn't
[2917.04 → 2917.56] incredible
[2917.56 → 2918.68] is that
[2918.68 → 2919.76] they are effectively
[2919.76 → 2921.62] putting a price
[2921.62 → 2922.30] barrier
[2922.30 → 2923.42] in the way
[2923.42 → 2924.64] of AM5,
[2924.88 → 2925.68] which is the
[2925.68 → 2926.54] new AM4.
[2926.84 → 2927.74] That's the one
[2927.74 → 2928.50] that people
[2928.50 → 2929.84] who might not
[2929.84 → 2930.60] have a ton of money
[2930.60 → 2931.08] today,
[2931.26 → 2932.02] but might want
[2932.02 → 2932.52] to be able to
[2932.52 → 2933.44] upgrade down the line.
[2933.46 → 2934.22] That's the one
[2934.22 → 2934.72] they should be
[2934.72 → 2935.84] buying so that
[2935.84 → 2936.42] they can
[2936.42 → 2938.76] be able to
[2938.76 → 2939.56] upgrade in the
[2939.56 → 2939.96] future,
[2940.10 → 2940.28] right?
[2940.40 → 2941.58] To take advantage
[2941.58 → 2942.80] of some of the
[2942.80 → 2944.08] very consumer-first
[2944.08 → 2944.90] things that AMD
[2944.90 → 2945.30] does.
[2946.06 → 2946.60] So,
[2946.68 → 2946.84] no,
[2947.02 → 2948.16] I am not.
[2948.16 → 2950.00] I'm not going
[2950.00 → 2950.82] to stop
[2950.82 → 2952.92] calling out AMD
[2952.92 → 2954.02] for not
[2954.02 → 2954.64] introducing
[2954.64 → 2955.40] entry-level
[2955.40 → 2956.02] processors.
[2957.08 → 2957.94] AM5's not
[2957.94 → 2958.38] new.
[2959.16 → 2959.34] Like,
[2959.94 → 2960.62] for crying out
[2960.62 → 2960.82] loud,
[2960.88 → 2961.14] when did
[2961.14 → 2962.28] Ry zen 7000
[2962.28 → 2962.80] launch?
[2963.64 → 2963.96] Hold on,
[2964.00 → 2964.40] let me check.
[2964.54 → 2965.16] Let me check this.
[2966.00 → 2966.80] September of
[2966.80 → 2967.52] 2022!
[2969.60 → 2970.60] AM5 launched
[2970.60 → 2972.52] two years ago,
[2972.52 → 2973.70] and you still
[2973.70 → 2974.68] can't buy a chip
[2974.68 → 2975.36] for it under
[2975.36 → 2976.30] about 200
[2976.30 → 2977.02] US dollars.
[2977.78 → 2978.02] No,
[2978.16 → 2978.66] I don't think
[2978.66 → 2979.30] that's okay.
[2982.24 → 2982.96] Let me check.
[2983.02 → 2983.34] Let me check
[2983.34 → 2984.16] what the 7600
[2984.16 → 2984.56] is.
[2985.76 → 2986.46] It might be
[2986.46 → 2987.34] under 200.
[2987.90 → 2988.38] Hold on.
[2988.78 → 2989.16] Is your phone
[2989.16 → 2989.58] making noise?
[2989.64 → 2989.74] No,
[2989.78 → 2990.20] that is not
[2990.20 → 2990.46] mine.
[2990.86 → 2991.16] Also,
[2991.50 → 2992.36] there's been some
[2992.36 → 2992.84] calls to,
[2993.06 → 2993.08] like,
[2993.60 → 2994.02] if you're going
[2994.02 → 2994.98] to talk about
[2994.98 → 2996.02] this with AMD,
[2996.22 → 2996.70] you should talk
[2996.70 → 2997.26] about Intel
[2997.26 → 2997.54] too.
[2997.94 → 2998.60] I think there's
[2998.60 → 2999.14] no illusion
[2999.14 → 3001.00] that Intel
[3001.00 → 3001.56] is in an
[3001.56 → 3002.04] extremely
[3002.04 → 3002.76] significant amount
[3002.76 → 3003.26] of hot water
[3003.26 → 3003.62] right now.
[3003.62 → 3003.90] We're just
[3003.90 → 3004.26] trying to make
[3004.26 → 3004.82] it clears that
[3004.82 → 3005.44] that doesn't
[3005.44 → 3006.20] mean that the
[3006.20 → 3006.78] other side
[3006.78 → 3007.96] is...
[3007.96 → 3008.64] And this
[3008.64 → 3009.98] specific thing,
[3010.10 → 3010.34] no,
[3010.52 → 3011.22] this specific
[3011.22 → 3011.62] thing,
[3012.32 → 3013.00] Intel isn't
[3013.00 → 3013.26] doing.
[3014.34 → 3014.72] Intel
[3014.72 → 3016.04] absolutely
[3016.04 → 3017.22] nerfed the
[3017.22 → 3018.64] crap out of
[3018.64 → 3019.30] their entry-level
[3019.30 → 3020.18] chips for many
[3020.18 → 3020.60] years.
[3021.32 → 3021.44] But,
[3021.52 → 3021.64] Matt,
[3021.68 → 3022.10] you can pick
[3022.10 → 3022.24] up,
[3022.36 → 3022.42] like,
[3022.44 → 3023.42] a 14100.
[3025.16 → 3025.78] Let's see.
[3025.96 → 3026.42] There's actually,
[3026.52 → 3027.08] there's some
[3027.08 → 3028.06] perfect
[3028.06 → 3030.18] Intel 14
[3030.18 → 3030.98] series chips
[3030.98 → 3031.36] that are,
[3031.44 → 3031.60] like,
[3031.64 → 3032.70] an outstanding
[3032.70 → 3033.66] value if you're
[3033.66 → 3034.34] a budget gamer.
[3034.82 → 3035.30] Now,
[3035.50 → 3036.84] I would not
[3036.84 → 3037.82] necessarily recommend
[3037.82 → 3038.18] those.
[3038.52 → 3039.28] I would actually
[3039.28 → 3040.08] rather that you
[3040.08 → 3040.86] go pick up,
[3040.88 → 3041.16] like,
[3041.20 → 3041.92] a used Ry zen
[3041.92 → 3042.62] 3000 or
[3042.62 → 3043.16] something like
[3043.16 → 3043.46] that.
[3043.98 → 3044.36] But,
[3044.46 → 3045.20] if you must
[3045.20 → 3045.80] have something
[3045.80 → 3046.28] brand new
[3046.28 → 3046.90] with a warranty
[3046.90 → 3047.46] and all of
[3047.46 → 3047.86] those things
[3047.86 → 3048.16] that,
[3048.22 → 3048.44] you know,
[3048.52 → 3049.22] kind of make
[3049.22 → 3049.78] you feel better
[3049.78 → 3050.12] or whatever
[3050.12 → 3050.40] else,
[3050.44 → 3050.70] that's not
[3050.70 → 3051.08] my thing,
[3051.14 → 3051.58] but if that's
[3051.58 → 3051.98] your thing,
[3052.50 → 3053.16] then Intel
[3053.16 → 3054.34] absolutely has
[3054.34 → 3055.10] value options.
[3055.44 → 3055.88] They do.
[3056.60 → 3057.22] But we've
[3057.22 → 3057.52] got to
[3057.52 → 3058.04] recognize,
[3058.06 → 3058.70] that that's
[3058.70 → 3059.14] not because
[3059.14 → 3059.60] Intel is
[3059.60 → 3060.18] benevolent.
[3060.48 → 3060.82] That is
[3060.82 → 3061.60] because Intel
[3061.60 → 3061.96] is in a
[3061.96 → 3062.74] position where
[3062.74 → 3063.22] they are
[3063.22 → 3064.00] looking for
[3064.00 → 3064.56] gaps in the
[3064.56 → 3065.06] market where
[3065.06 → 3065.58] they can sell
[3065.58 → 3065.96] chips.
[3067.08 → 3067.60] And AMD
[3067.60 → 3068.40] didn't create
[3068.40 → 3069.74] Thread ripper 1900X
[3069.74 → 3070.36] because they were
[3070.36 → 3070.88] benevolent.
[3070.92 → 3071.32] They did it
[3071.32 → 3072.26] because Intel
[3072.26 → 3073.06] left the high-end
[3073.06 → 3073.80] desktop market
[3073.80 → 3074.76] completely unaddressed.
[3074.84 → 3075.06] They got
[3075.06 → 3075.66] complacent.
[3076.60 → 3077.12] So,
[3077.24 → 3077.58] what I'm
[3077.58 → 3078.52] advocating for
[3078.52 → 3079.46] is for
[3079.46 → 3081.10] everyone to
[3081.10 → 3082.66] address their
[3082.66 → 3083.14] customers'
[3083.40 → 3083.74] needs
[3083.74 → 3084.60] proactively
[3084.60 → 3085.90] rather than
[3085.90 → 3087.20] wait around
[3087.20 → 3087.72] for us to
[3087.72 → 3087.92] go,
[3088.12 → 3088.36] yo,
[3088.96 → 3089.26] hey,
[3090.06 → 3090.88] where the
[3090.88 → 3092.40] heck is
[3092.40 → 3093.58] a value
[3093.58 → 3094.28] Zen 4
[3094.28 → 3094.96] processor?
[3097.60 → 3098.38] What is
[3098.38 → 3098.92] going on
[3098.92 → 3099.20] here?
[3100.34 → 3101.00] Why is
[3101.00 → 3101.54] Zen 5
[3101.54 → 3102.12] launching
[3102.12 → 3103.36] purely with
[3103.36 → 3103.96] high-end
[3103.96 → 3105.40] and
[3105.40 → 3106.72] absolutely
[3106.72 → 3107.86] no
[3107.86 → 3108.86] indication,
[3109.10 → 3109.42] no
[3109.42 → 3110.14] telegraphing
[3110.14 → 3111.02] whatsoever
[3111.02 → 3111.92] of when
[3111.92 → 3112.22] you're going
[3112.22 → 3112.76] to address
[3112.76 → 3113.24] the entry
[3113.24 → 3113.62] level?
[3114.34 → 3114.78] When am
[3114.78 → 3115.00] I'm going
[3115.00 → 3115.20] to be
[3115.20 → 3115.52] able to
[3115.52 → 3115.96] buy one
[3115.96 → 3116.28] of these
[3116.28 → 3117.36] stupid
[3117.36 → 3118.16] efficient
[3118.16 → 3118.52] chips?
[3118.66 → 3118.92] Maybe I
[3118.92 → 3119.22] only need
[3119.22 → 3119.48] a couple
[3119.48 → 3119.78] cores.
[3119.88 → 3120.12] Maybe I'm
[3120.12 → 3120.44] building a
[3120.44 → 3120.80] NAS.
[3121.26 → 3121.66] When am
[3121.66 → 3121.88] I'm going
[3121.88 → 3122.08] to be
[3122.08 → 3122.56] able to
[3122.56 → 3122.80] buy
[3122.80 → 3123.34] Zen 5
[3123.34 → 3123.84] for that?
[3126.14 → 3126.50] No,
[3126.54 → 3126.80] it's not
[3126.80 → 3127.12] okay.
[3131.04 → 3131.52] That's all
[3131.52 → 3131.76] I have to
[3131.76 → 3132.06] say about
[3132.06 → 3132.30] that.
[3133.96 → 3134.86] I got
[3134.86 → 3135.18] another one
[3135.18 → 3135.42] for you
[3135.42 → 3135.58] here.
[3136.00 → 3136.14] Hey,
[3136.24 → 3136.54] Linus,
[3136.58 → 3136.74] you've
[3136.74 → 3137.24] been daily
[3137.24 → 3137.66] driving
[3137.66 → 3138.20] Qualcomm
[3138.20 → 3138.68] Snapdragon.
[3139.12 → 3140.12] After getting
[3140.12 → 3140.58] your hands
[3140.58 → 3141.38] on Zen 5
[3141.38 → 3141.74] Strip,
[3142.04 → 3142.40] are you
[3142.40 → 3142.90] eager to
[3142.90 → 3143.54] switch back
[3143.54 → 3144.04] to AMD?
[3144.60 → 3144.90] Anything
[3144.90 → 3145.18] you were
[3145.18 → 3145.74] expecting to
[3145.74 → 3146.14] see in
[3146.14 → 3146.76] Zen 5
[3146.76 → 3147.24] you hope
[3147.24 → 3147.50] to see
[3147.50 → 3148.22] in Zen 6?
[3149.60 → 3150.32] I am
[3150.32 → 3150.82] not eager
[3150.82 → 3151.22] to switch
[3151.22 → 3151.56] back.
[3152.80 → 3153.32] Oh.
[3153.64 → 3154.42] What I
[3154.42 → 3155.36] have realized
[3155.36 → 3158.34] is basically
[3158.34 → 3159.58] everything I
[3159.58 → 3160.46] do on my
[3160.46 → 3161.98] laptop is
[3161.98 → 3162.60] in a
[3162.60 → 3162.96] browser,
[3162.96 → 3164.24] except for
[3164.24 → 3164.48] the
[3164.48 → 3165.12] occasional
[3165.12 → 3165.60] thing,
[3165.86 → 3166.70] and I
[3166.70 → 3167.22] haven't run
[3167.22 → 3168.36] into anything
[3168.36 → 3168.84] catastrophic
[3168.84 → 3169.38] yet.
[3170.82 → 3171.40] I am
[3171.40 → 3172.24] really
[3172.24 → 3172.86] enjoying
[3172.86 → 3173.32] charging...
[3173.32 → 3173.40] If you're
[3173.40 → 3173.80] hitting that
[3173.80 → 3173.86] realization,
[3174.44 → 3174.76] should you
[3174.76 → 3175.18] just be on
[3175.18 → 3175.56] a Mac?
[3177.26 → 3177.94] I thought
[3177.94 → 3178.14] you were
[3178.14 → 3179.20] going to
[3179.20 → 3180.40] go Chromebook.
[3182.40 → 3183.08] Got it.
[3184.14 → 3184.84] Never mess
[3184.84 → 3185.14] with the
[3185.14 → 3185.50] producer.
[3185.78 → 3186.22] Blocked.
[3186.44 → 3187.14] Never mess
[3187.14 → 3187.44] with the
[3187.44 → 3187.78] producer.
[3187.78 → 3191.66] I didn't
[3191.66 → 3192.28] expect that.
[3193.56 → 3194.00] You're
[3194.00 → 3194.10] going to
[3194.10 → 3194.44] make me
[3194.44 → 3194.86] support
[3194.86 → 3195.24] Mac?
[3195.36 → 3195.72] We have
[3195.72 → 3195.94] a whole
[3195.94 → 3196.54] topic on
[3196.54 → 3197.08] why that's
[3197.08 → 3197.24] going to
[3197.24 → 3197.60] be hell
[3197.60 → 3197.94] later.
[3199.14 → 3199.36] Yeah.
[3199.86 → 3200.22] Oh, do
[3200.22 → 3200.38] we?
[3200.70 → 3201.06] Yeah.
[3201.70 → 3203.30] I, I, I,
[3203.52 → 3204.40] I, okay, my
[3204.40 → 3205.10] understanding is
[3205.10 → 3205.76] that Apple has
[3205.76 → 3206.44] addressed window
[3206.44 → 3207.70] management in a
[3207.70 → 3208.16] big way.
[3208.64 → 3209.38] So that was
[3209.38 → 3210.24] one of my
[3210.24 → 3211.14] irritations with
[3211.14 → 3212.08] Mac is I, I'm
[3212.08 → 3212.94] sorry, I refuse to
[3212.94 → 3215.26] buy a window
[3215.26 → 3215.72] management
[3215.72 → 3216.62] application.
[3217.24 → 3217.88] But my
[3217.88 → 3218.42] understanding is
[3218.42 → 3218.80] it's way better
[3218.80 → 3218.98] now.
[3219.08 → 3219.48] You're right.
[3219.78 → 3220.48] Search is way
[3220.48 → 3220.74] better.
[3221.14 → 3221.80] But if there's
[3221.80 → 3222.68] one thing that
[3222.68 → 3223.30] would keep me
[3223.30 → 3223.74] off of the
[3223.74 → 3224.98] Mac anyway, it
[3224.98 → 3225.36] would be
[3225.36 → 3225.72] Finder.
[3226.30 → 3227.40] I do not
[3227.40 → 3228.02] like Finder.
[3228.38 → 3229.18] I do not
[3229.18 → 3229.84] find it to be
[3229.84 → 3230.84] intuitive to
[3230.84 → 3232.60] navigate folder
[3232.60 → 3233.00] structures.
[3233.22 → 3233.98] I do not find
[3233.98 → 3234.66] it is intuitive to
[3234.66 → 3235.48] access network
[3235.48 → 3235.90] shares.
[3236.90 → 3238.06] Apple went
[3238.06 → 3239.80] very DAS
[3239.80 → 3240.54] heavy.
[3240.54 → 3242.80] and it's, it
[3242.80 → 3243.72] was very clear
[3243.72 → 3244.58] from, you know,
[3244.62 → 3245.34] the Thunderbolt
[3245.34 → 3246.82] drive towers and
[3246.82 → 3247.88] just the, the
[3247.88 → 3248.66] workflows that
[3248.66 → 3249.06] Apple would
[3249.06 → 3249.68] feature in their
[3249.68 → 3250.54] marketing collateral
[3250.54 → 3251.60] that they just
[3251.60 → 3253.00] didn't really get
[3253.00 → 3253.66] NAS.
[3254.34 → 3255.50] The funny thing is
[3255.50 → 3257.50] that Apple was, I
[3257.50 → 3258.56] would say one of
[3258.56 → 3260.06] the key players in
[3260.06 → 3261.62] moving 10 gigs to
[3261.62 → 3262.04] the mainstream.
[3262.18 → 3262.80] Like the fact that
[3262.80 → 3264.66] the Mac mini launched
[3264.66 → 3266.50] with 10 gig as an
[3266.50 → 3267.48] option, like the new
[3267.48 → 3269.00] Mac mini or the new,
[3269.06 → 3269.84] new, the less new
[3269.84 → 3270.38] whatever.
[3270.84 → 3271.92] When, when Apple
[3271.92 → 3273.18] made 10 gig
[3273.18 → 3274.08] networking an option
[3274.08 → 3275.36] on the Mac mini and
[3275.36 → 3276.48] then dual 10 gig on
[3276.48 → 3277.24] the Mac pro, I was
[3277.24 → 3279.46] like, thank you.
[3280.68 → 3281.08] Finally.
[3281.68 → 3282.38] You know, someone's
[3282.38 → 3282.80] doing it because
[3282.80 → 3283.98] Apple's the one that
[3283.98 → 3284.36] does it.
[3284.40 → 3284.78] And then everyone
[3284.78 → 3285.52] else goes, oh,
[3285.52 → 3286.62] okay, we're not
[3286.62 → 3287.86] going to be our
[3287.86 → 3288.74] spec page isn't
[3288.74 → 3289.38] going to be comparable
[3289.38 → 3290.80] to Apple if we
[3290.80 → 3291.48] don't have this.
[3291.52 → 3292.02] It's like, okay,
[3292.10 → 3292.76] yeah, frigging
[3292.76 → 3293.64] a let's finally go
[3293.64 → 3294.00] 10 gig.
[3295.84 → 3296.72] But anyway,
[3296.84 → 3297.28] it was in a
[3297.28 → 3299.42] browser and the
[3299.42 → 3300.06] search on the
[3300.06 → 3300.74] computer is pretty
[3300.74 → 3301.10] good.
[3301.56 → 3302.82] Does finder being
[3302.82 → 3304.24] an annoying piece
[3304.24 → 3305.00] of junk really
[3305.00 → 3305.32] matter?
[3305.70 → 3306.28] Yeah, it does.
[3306.36 → 3307.12] Because I still
[3307.12 → 3307.52] will.
[3307.64 → 3307.84] Yeah.
[3307.94 → 3309.20] I, I navigate the
[3309.20 → 3309.98] folder structure of
[3309.98 → 3310.66] my computer
[3310.66 → 3312.76] frequently enough
[3312.76 → 3313.62] that it would be a
[3313.62 → 3313.80] problem.
[3314.00 → 3314.44] Are you just old?
[3314.44 → 3317.70] Um, I don't think so.
[3317.78 → 3319.82] I think I just do a
[3319.82 → 3322.44] lot of work and, um,
[3323.36 → 3324.44] I think I just do a
[3324.44 → 3325.10] lot of work that
[3325.10 → 3326.84] requires me to be in
[3326.84 → 3327.70] my folder structure.
[3328.18 → 3328.74] Like I work at a
[3328.74 → 3329.32] media company.
[3329.54 → 3330.20] Is you looking through
[3330.20 → 3331.08] the folder structure on
[3331.08 → 3332.22] the computer a symptom
[3332.22 → 3333.46] of Windows search being
[3333.46 → 3334.06] so bad?
[3334.62 → 3335.54] No, because I
[3335.54 → 3336.42] wouldn't do it so much
[3336.42 → 3337.26] if search would work.
[3337.78 → 3339.08] Yeah, I still would
[3339.08 → 3339.68] because I wouldn't
[3339.68 → 3340.58] remember exactly what
[3340.58 → 3341.26] something's called
[3341.26 → 3341.80] necessarily.
[3341.80 → 3342.68] Like many of the
[3342.68 → 3343.20] files that I'm
[3343.20 → 3344.34] accessing are MVP
[3344.34 → 3346.18] 0723 dot whatever
[3346.18 → 3347.82] like it, like footage
[3347.82 → 3348.80] things like that.
[3348.80 → 3348.98] Right.
[3349.06 → 3349.96] I know I need to be,
[3350.08 → 3351.04] I need to be able to
[3351.04 → 3351.76] quickly go to the
[3351.76 → 3352.42] folder seat and
[3352.42 → 3353.10] thumbnail view.
[3353.48 → 3353.88] Exactly.
[3354.34 → 3355.50] Um, so with the
[3355.50 → 3356.26] amount of that, that
[3356.26 → 3357.66] I do, I just, I just
[3357.66 → 3358.32] don't see it.
[3358.70 → 3360.32] And a part of it for
[3360.32 → 3361.26] me, I have to confess
[3361.26 → 3362.44] it would be just being
[3362.44 → 3363.18] old and set in my
[3363.18 → 3363.52] ways.
[3363.68 → 3364.38] I don't want to
[3364.38 → 3365.84] remember new shortcuts
[3365.84 → 3367.82] like keyboard shortcuts.
[3368.48 → 3369.88] Um, yeah, yeah.
[3369.92 → 3370.28] Me neither.
[3370.28 → 3372.14] I, I do not
[3372.14 → 3373.26] objectively.
[3373.56 → 3374.68] I stand, I, I
[3374.68 → 3375.24] believe this is
[3375.24 → 3375.70] objective.
[3376.40 → 3379.28] I, Apple's, um,
[3379.36 → 3381.60] command key is really
[3381.60 → 3382.78] hard to reach compared
[3382.78 → 3383.74] to control for
[3383.74 → 3384.70] executing shortcuts.
[3384.70 → 3386.12] I would, that's not
[3386.12 → 3387.26] something that I would
[3387.26 → 3388.64] ever think is better
[3388.64 → 3389.84] or the same.
[3390.04 → 3390.44] Are we buying that?
[3391.72 → 3392.60] I genuinely don't know.
[3393.46 → 3395.22] I genuinely do not
[3395.22 → 3395.48] know.
[3396.42 → 3397.12] Uh, people are saying
[3397.12 → 3397.92] finder can show the
[3397.92 → 3398.34] folder path.
[3398.42 → 3398.56] Yeah.
[3398.56 → 3399.92] My issues with finder
[3399.92 → 3400.88] run deeper than just
[3400.88 → 3401.84] seeing or not seeing the
[3401.84 → 3402.32] folder path.
[3402.38 → 3403.28] I just do not like
[3403.28 → 3403.62] finder.
[3403.66 → 3404.00] I'm sorry.
[3405.08 → 3406.26] I, uh, yeah, I'm
[3406.26 → 3406.42] sorry.
[3406.46 → 3407.94] I just can't, I can't.
[3408.58 → 3409.40] Um, people are like
[3409.40 → 3410.34] every excuse not to try
[3410.34 → 3410.52] it out.
[3410.58 → 3411.74] Guys, I switched to a
[3411.74 → 3411.98] Mac.
[3412.48 → 3413.84] I switched to a Mac for
[3413.84 → 3414.30] over a month.
[3414.30 → 3414.82] I'm just trying to mess
[3414.82 → 3415.40] with Linus.
[3415.80 → 3418.46] Um, finder freaking
[3418.46 → 3419.48] sucks and I would use it
[3419.48 → 3419.68] too.
[3420.02 → 3420.98] Gomez says Linus,
[3421.04 → 3421.52] sorry, but you're
[3421.52 → 3422.40] objectively wrong.
[3422.50 → 3423.28] There's so many media
[3423.28 → 3424.28] companies that use Mac
[3424.28 → 3425.06] compared to Windows.
[3425.06 → 3428.62] That is like, oh, that's
[3428.62 → 3430.38] oh man, that is, that is
[3430.38 → 3432.34] so flawed for so many
[3432.34 → 3432.82] reasons.
[3433.60 → 3435.02] Nothing that I said was
[3435.02 → 3436.58] that media companies don't
[3436.58 → 3438.40] use Macs and you got to
[3438.40 → 3439.94] understand that a lot of
[3439.94 → 3441.74] the reasons that media
[3441.74 → 3442.90] companies use Macs, it's
[3442.90 → 3444.08] not because finder is good.
[3444.60 → 3445.78] Like I'm talking about the
[3445.78 → 3447.00] way that I need to access
[3447.00 → 3447.56] footage.
[3447.78 → 3449.36] I'm, I don't, I'm not an
[3449.36 → 3449.62] editor.
[3449.76 → 3450.70] I don't use final cut.
[3450.70 → 3452.74] I'm going in, and I'm, I
[3452.74 → 3454.96] am, I am like browsing
[3454.96 → 3456.40] media files.
[3456.56 → 3458.34] Like I'm, uh, like it'll
[3458.34 → 3459.32] be like, Hey Linus, can
[3459.32 → 3460.26] you have a look at this
[3460.26 → 3461.20] section of this clip?
[3461.32 → 3462.16] Is this something that
[3462.16 → 3462.74] needs a pickup?
[3463.10 → 3464.76] For example, I wouldn't
[3464.76 → 3466.90] open final cut or premiere
[3466.90 → 3467.34] for that.
[3467.36 → 3468.20] I would just, I would just
[3468.20 → 3468.98] go find the file.
[3469.12 → 3470.40] So yeah, I'm, I'm telling
[3470.40 → 3472.06] you guys my workflow
[3472.06 → 3475.02] specifically, um, requires
[3475.02 → 3476.48] me to be comfortable
[3476.48 → 3477.52] navigating the file
[3477.52 → 3477.90] structure.
[3478.28 → 3479.86] Uh, I'm not saying that
[3479.86 → 3480.68] I'm not even, I'm not
[3480.68 → 3481.58] arguing that media
[3481.58 → 3482.30] companies don't use
[3482.30 → 3482.68] Apple.
[3482.98 → 3484.50] Um, and a lot of it does
[3484.50 → 3485.56] not come down to finder.
[3485.62 → 3487.00] It comes down to a
[3487.00 → 3487.92] software like logic.
[3487.92 → 3488.84] It comes down to software
[3488.84 → 3490.16] like Final Cut Pro, right?
[3490.18 → 3491.78] It's not, we're not even,
[3492.04 → 3493.22] we're not even talking
[3493.22 → 3494.04] about the same thing.
[3494.10 → 3494.98] There is no objectively
[3494.98 → 3497.66] wrong that I find finder
[3497.66 → 3499.54] to be unintuitive and
[3499.54 → 3500.82] difficult to use compared
[3500.82 → 3501.38] to Explorer.
[3501.80 → 3502.96] Explorer is not perfect.
[3503.62 → 3504.60] Explorer absolutely has
[3504.60 → 3506.08] its issues, but, uh,
[3507.12 → 3508.74] yeah, no, basically
[3508.74 → 3510.26] Explorer is pretty good.
[3510.68 → 3512.10] I don't disagree that it
[3512.10 → 3513.04] has its issues and stuff,
[3513.14 → 3513.80] but Explorer is pretty
[3513.80 → 3514.02] good.
[3514.14 → 3515.72] I mean, it has, it even
[3515.72 → 3516.66] suffers from some of the
[3516.66 → 3517.66] things that I find
[3517.66 → 3518.96] frustrating about Apple.
[3519.46 → 3521.10] Like, for example, why is
[3521.10 → 3522.10] there a limit to how big I
[3522.10 → 3522.74] can have my thumbnails?
[3523.62 → 3524.64] Why can't I just have even
[3524.64 → 3525.16] bigger ones?
[3526.78 → 3527.14] Right?
[3527.20 → 3527.48] Like why?
[3528.08 → 3529.12] And that's such an Apple
[3529.12 → 3529.46] thing.
[3529.66 → 3530.80] Like, I remember, I think
[3530.80 → 3532.24] it was you, Luke, that I
[3532.24 → 3533.10] showed this to, and you
[3533.10 → 3533.86] were like, what?
[3534.52 → 3535.90] Uh, when I showed you that
[3535.90 → 3537.14] there's, there's like a an
[3537.14 → 3539.00] artificial limitation to how
[3539.00 → 3540.44] far you can zoom into a
[3540.44 → 3542.06] picture when you're, when
[3542.06 → 3542.92] you're looking at it on an
[3542.92 → 3543.22] iPhone.
[3543.84 → 3544.46] As iPhone.
[3544.58 → 3544.72] Yeah.
[3544.88 → 3545.98] Like, that's so wacky.
[3546.12 → 3547.36] And the fact that you like,
[3547.48 → 3549.58] and you know, because,
[3549.70 → 3551.18] because you know, Apple,
[3551.34 → 3551.58] right?
[3552.00 → 3553.70] You understand the product
[3553.70 → 3554.78] philosophy, right?
[3554.96 → 3556.18] The reason is that they
[3556.18 → 3557.06] don't want you zooming in
[3557.06 → 3558.02] too far because it'll look
[3558.02 → 3558.46] blurry.
[3558.82 → 3560.06] It's like, no, I'm actually
[3560.06 → 3561.18] just trying to see that.
[3561.68 → 3563.14] And, and you can zoom in
[3563.14 → 3564.40] as far as you can like
[3564.40 → 3565.80] reach on the screen.
[3565.80 → 3567.06] But when you let go, it'll
[3567.06 → 3568.18] like wing back.
[3568.50 → 3569.86] No, I actually just want to
[3569.86 → 3570.30] leave it there.
[3570.36 → 3570.96] I don't want to keep my
[3570.96 → 3571.90] fingers on the screen to be
[3571.90 → 3572.54] able to see this.
[3572.60 → 3573.86] And just like stupid things
[3573.86 → 3574.96] like that, like not being
[3574.96 → 3576.36] able to lock an iPhone in
[3576.36 → 3577.66] landscape mode, even though
[3577.66 → 3578.60] you can with an iPad.
[3579.32 → 3580.58] And that was true even back
[3580.58 → 3581.34] when they were both using
[3581.34 → 3582.98] the same, same operating
[3582.98 → 3583.34] system.
[3583.42 → 3584.60] They were both using iOS, but
[3584.60 → 3585.32] it was just an arbitrary
[3585.32 → 3585.98] limitation.
[3587.90 → 3589.56] Like it's just stuff like
[3589.56 → 3589.80] that.
[3589.88 → 3590.96] But Microsoft absolutely
[3590.96 → 3591.68] does the same thing
[3591.68 → 3592.04] sometimes.
[3592.04 → 3593.22] And I'm sure, you know,
[3593.24 → 3594.36] the thumbnail size thing
[3594.36 → 3596.96] is, is again, back to
[3596.96 → 3598.34] different company cultures,
[3598.46 → 3598.96] different company
[3598.96 → 3599.66] philosophies with
[3599.66 → 3600.04] Microsoft.
[3600.04 → 3601.26] It's probably more to do
[3601.26 → 3602.74] with the fact that no one
[3602.74 → 3604.12] felt like revising the
[3604.12 → 3604.90] code too much.
[3604.90 → 3605.64] And it's been this way
[3605.64 → 3606.60] since XP or whatever.
[3606.60 → 3608.30] Like it's, it's for
[3608.30 → 3609.62] completely different reasons,
[3609.62 → 3611.36] but I do think there's
[3611.36 → 3612.22] absolutely ways that
[3612.22 → 3612.84] Explorer could be
[3612.84 → 3613.38] improved.
[3613.62 → 3614.86] I just do prefer it to
[3614.86 → 3615.20] finder.
[3619.64 → 3620.04] Okay.
[3620.12 → 3620.62] Should we do some more
[3620.62 → 3620.90] topics?
[3620.96 → 3621.38] It's all a merch
[3621.38 → 3622.14] message, wasn't it?
[3622.68 → 3623.42] I don't even know.
[3623.48 → 3624.26] Who even knows anymore?
[3624.26 → 3625.00] Did we only do one
[3625.00 → 3625.42] merch message?
[3625.54 → 3626.18] I think we're supposed to
[3626.18 → 3626.72] do another one.
[3627.24 → 3627.72] All right.
[3627.80 → 3628.28] Hit us, Dan.
[3628.36 → 3629.48] Oh, that would be three
[3629.48 → 3630.26] merch messages.
[3630.48 → 3630.74] Okay.
[3630.74 → 3631.64] Oh, are we mixing it up?
[3631.64 → 3632.26] I screwed up.
[3632.48 → 3633.62] Okay, fine, Luke.
[3633.68 → 3634.22] Well, hold on, hold on.
[3634.22 → 3635.12] Before we do that.
[3635.24 → 3636.04] Sorry, Dan.
[3636.12 → 3637.06] I just, I thought we only
[3637.06 → 3637.46] did one.
[3637.56 → 3637.74] That's my thing.
[3637.74 → 3638.18] No, no, no.
[3638.30 → 3638.62] That's okay.
[3638.68 → 3639.58] Before we do that, there
[3639.58 → 3640.84] are a few things for us to
[3640.84 → 3641.90] talk about real quick.
[3642.04 → 3643.74] We have some cool stuff for
[3643.74 → 3644.96] you guys to check out on
[3644.96 → 3645.72] the store if you're
[3645.72 → 3646.76] looking for an excuse
[3646.76 → 3648.82] to send a mere message?
[3649.30 → 3650.56] A mercenary message.
[3651.02 → 3651.78] If you're looking to
[3651.78 → 3652.52] send a merch message,
[3652.92 → 3653.84] we have a poster.
[3654.66 → 3655.58] I don't think we've ever
[3655.58 → 3657.36] done a poster before.
[3657.88 → 3658.80] But you can level up
[3658.80 → 3659.94] your space with the
[3659.94 → 3662.24] intergalactic GPU poster.
[3662.82 → 3665.08] It's just a cute art print
[3665.08 → 3666.94] of a legally distinct GPU
[3666.94 → 3668.54] that is literally out of
[3668.54 → 3669.12] this world.
[3670.16 → 3670.76] Look at that.
[3671.18 → 3672.74] Your Space 2 could...
[3672.74 → 3674.80] There we go.
[3674.80 → 3676.78] Your Space 2 could look
[3676.78 → 3677.40] like that.
[3677.80 → 3678.48] Frame not included.
[3679.90 → 3681.12] I actually have one with
[3681.12 → 3681.34] me.
[3682.30 → 3683.10] Isn't that classy?
[3683.52 → 3683.96] Love it.
[3684.62 → 3685.62] Oh, where'd Luke go?
[3685.76 → 3686.30] Oh, there he is.
[3686.56 → 3686.86] Anyway.
[3687.06 → 3688.22] Where are you growling at?
[3688.46 → 3689.54] I have one with me.
[3690.06 → 3691.70] Arthur asked me to
[3691.70 → 3692.94] specifically call out that
[3692.94 → 3694.44] the frame is not...
[3694.44 → 3695.50] Man, I'm gonna...
[3695.50 → 3696.64] Dude, I'm going to get this.
[3697.06 → 3698.80] Wait, how is that...
[3698.80 → 3700.38] Is that camera not level?
[3700.38 → 3701.84] I swear this is level.
[3703.28 → 3703.64] Okay.
[3704.80 → 3705.44] This is painful.
[3705.60 → 3706.32] Okay, there you go.
[3706.92 → 3708.40] That's what it looks like.
[3710.86 → 3712.52] It comes in a tube
[3712.52 → 3714.26] and it's available now.
[3714.52 → 3715.76] So that's one of the
[3715.76 → 3716.60] announcements for the
[3716.60 → 3717.36] store this week.
[3717.50 → 3718.08] Does it come with the
[3718.08 → 3718.34] frame?
[3720.66 → 3721.10] No.
[3721.50 → 3721.98] Dan.
[3722.38 → 3723.08] I just wanted you to
[3723.08 → 3723.42] reiterate.
[3723.70 → 3724.68] Shout out Gary from our
[3724.68 → 3725.44] design team.
[3725.76 → 3727.22] And it's printed using
[3727.22 → 3728.64] pigment ink on lustre
[3728.64 → 3729.84] photo paper, which means
[3729.84 → 3730.78] it's got greater colour and
[3730.78 → 3731.40] detail, and it's more
[3731.40 → 3732.34] resistant to fading than
[3732.34 → 3733.02] your average poster.
[3733.12 → 3733.74] Oh, okay.
[3733.74 → 3734.38] Thanks, team.
[3735.00 → 3736.26] It's available in super
[3736.26 → 3737.38] limited quantities with a
[3737.38 → 3738.36] limit of one per person.
[3738.52 → 3738.92] Oh, okay.
[3738.98 → 3739.78] Apparently this is just
[3739.78 → 3741.96] like a small thing.
[3742.60 → 3744.00] Oh, also...
[3744.00 → 3744.86] Oh, where'd it go?
[3745.98 → 3746.42] Here it is.
[3746.68 → 3747.80] Our collaboration with
[3747.80 → 3749.78] Delta Hub is now live.
[3749.90 → 3750.58] You can pick up one of
[3750.58 → 3751.94] these LTT...
[3751.94 → 3754.40] And sure.
[3754.78 → 3755.80] One of these LTT
[3755.80 → 3757.64] Carries today using the
[3757.64 → 3758.34] link in the description.
[3758.34 → 3760.26] It's got Teflon feet, so
[3760.26 → 3761.44] unlike a standard wrist rest,
[3761.56 → 3762.66] it glides along with your
[3762.66 → 3763.02] hand.
[3764.02 → 3764.82] There we go.
[3765.22 → 3766.94] While you're using it and
[3766.94 → 3768.22] basically supports your
[3768.22 → 3768.50] wrists.
[3768.82 → 3770.62] There's only 2,000 units
[3770.62 → 3772.08] available, so grab yours
[3772.08 → 3772.88] before they run out.
[3772.96 → 3773.44] We're going to have it
[3773.44 → 3774.00] linked in the video
[3774.00 → 3774.38] description.
[3774.86 → 3776.22] And I have one last
[3776.22 → 3776.98] store update for you
[3776.98 → 3777.30] guys.
[3777.78 → 3778.80] Scribe Drivers.
[3779.90 → 3780.58] That's right.
[3780.84 → 3781.78] The product that should
[3781.78 → 3782.58] have been called the
[3782.58 → 3783.08] write-off.
[3783.66 → 3784.94] Scribe Drivers are going
[3784.94 → 3786.74] to be in stock soon.
[3787.08 → 3788.46] We've been getting a ton
[3788.46 → 3789.40] of comments and messages
[3789.40 → 3790.16] asking when we're going to
[3790.16 → 3791.10] be restocking the Scribe
[3791.10 → 3791.44] Driver.
[3791.70 → 3792.42] For those who don't
[3792.42 → 3793.44] know, it's a stainless
[3793.44 → 3796.60] steel bolt-action pen that
[3796.60 → 3798.30] is made out of repurposed
[3798.30 → 3800.94] LTT original from the
[3800.94 → 3802.12] original supplier that
[3802.12 → 3804.08] disappeared and screwed
[3804.08 → 3805.28] us over and then made
[3805.28 → 3807.30] these subpar shafts that
[3807.30 → 3808.36] were not the right
[3808.36 → 3809.20] knurling type for a
[3809.20 → 3809.56] screwdriver.
[3809.86 → 3811.26] But it turns out great
[3811.26 → 3811.90] for a pen.
[3811.90 → 3813.10] So it's made out of
[3813.10 → 3814.12] repurposed LTT
[3814.12 → 3815.34] screwdriver shafts.
[3815.52 → 3816.58] When we initially
[3816.58 → 3817.28] launched the Scribe
[3817.28 → 3819.10] Driver, we sold out of
[3819.10 → 3821.36] all 5,000 of them in,
[3821.48 → 3822.88] I believe it was 33
[3822.88 → 3824.74] hours or something like
[3824.74 → 3825.02] that.
[3826.08 → 3826.84] Like it was, it was
[3826.84 → 3827.58] about a day.
[3827.66 → 3828.68] It was crazy.
[3828.96 → 3830.20] I don't think, oh, I
[3830.20 → 3830.64] was going to say, I
[3830.64 → 3831.34] don't think we've ever
[3831.34 → 3832.52] seen sales velocity like
[3832.52 → 3833.90] this, but I think the
[3833.90 → 3835.02] original screwdriver may
[3835.02 → 3835.68] have been higher.
[3836.22 → 3837.52] But either way, this,
[3837.64 → 3838.50] this was...
[3838.50 → 3839.30] I don't think we've
[3839.30 → 3841.52] ever been as surprised
[3841.52 → 3842.56] by sales velocity.
[3842.92 → 3843.56] Certainly not.
[3844.26 → 3845.22] I think we had like
[3845.22 → 3846.40] 200 left near the end
[3846.40 → 3847.38] of WAN show, right?
[3848.10 → 3848.72] It was like...
[3848.72 → 3849.56] Yeah, it was crazy.
[3849.72 → 3849.90] Yeah.
[3849.98 → 3851.96] Anyway, we've come a
[3851.96 → 3852.60] little more prepared
[3852.60 → 3853.12] this time.
[3853.22 → 3853.64] We're going to have
[3853.64 → 3855.30] 10,000 available next
[3855.30 → 3857.70] week, but there's over
[3857.70 → 3859.10] 11,000 people already
[3859.10 → 3859.84] signed up for a
[3859.84 → 3860.38] notification.
[3860.72 → 3861.66] So if you want to
[3861.66 → 3862.32] secure your Scribe
[3862.32 → 3863.22] Driver before we run
[3863.22 → 3864.50] out again, sign up to
[3864.50 → 3865.12] get notified at
[3865.12 → 3866.90] leg.GG slash pen.
[3866.90 → 3867.56] And then you will
[3867.56 → 3869.36] know exactly when we
[3869.36 → 3869.80] restock.
[3869.88 → 3870.50] I've seen so many
[3870.50 → 3871.32] people that are like,
[3871.94 → 3873.06] OMG, I'm being so
[3873.06 → 3874.76] careful with mine right
[3874.76 → 3876.00] now because they don't
[3876.00 → 3876.84] have any more stock.
[3876.96 → 3877.44] I'm going to buy
[3877.44 → 3878.68] another one like as
[3878.68 → 3879.72] soon as they restock so
[3879.72 → 3881.66] that I like don't have
[3881.66 → 3882.28] to be stressed about
[3882.28 → 3882.64] losing it.
[3882.68 → 3883.62] People are freaking
[3883.62 → 3885.36] loving this thing.
[3886.22 → 3888.48] Um, all right.
[3888.70 → 3889.50] That was it, Dan.
[3889.84 → 3890.56] Where are pens?
[3890.66 → 3892.30] Is pens under tools?
[3892.62 → 3892.86] Yes.
[3893.44 → 3894.08] The pen is under
[3894.08 → 3895.88] tools, which is fine.
[3895.88 → 3896.56] It's a writing tool,
[3896.74 → 3898.36] but seriously guys,
[3899.14 → 3899.74] five stars.
[3900.00 → 3900.68] Let's go.
[3901.42 → 3901.94] Look at this.
[3902.86 → 3904.84] Oh, the big one that
[3904.84 → 3905.62] I found is a bit
[3905.62 → 3906.16] disappointing.
[3906.28 → 3907.82] Well, look, that's
[3907.82 → 3908.80] all the proof you need
[3908.80 → 3911.16] that we do not censor
[3911.16 → 3912.50] people from posting
[3912.50 → 3913.48] their real impressions
[3913.48 → 3914.26] on our site.
[3914.44 → 3915.02] All right.
[3916.46 → 3917.38] There you go.
[3918.52 → 3919.00] Jeez.
[3919.82 → 3920.26] Awkward.
[3920.76 → 3921.42] This is what happens
[3921.42 → 3922.20] when I'm browsing the
[3922.20 → 3922.68] site live.
[3922.74 → 3923.26] You got to love it,
[3923.30 → 3923.46] right?
[3924.14 → 3925.30] That doesn't change
[3925.30 → 3926.82] the overall picture.
[3927.16 → 3928.40] Five-star product.
[3929.52 → 3929.92] Yeah.
[3931.54 → 3932.12] All right.
[3932.14 → 3932.56] What are we supposed
[3932.56 → 3933.28] to be doing right now?
[3933.78 → 3934.48] I'm doing, okay,
[3934.58 → 3935.14] more topics.
[3935.22 → 3935.56] Let's go.
[3935.62 → 3936.18] And I'm sorry,
[3936.30 → 3938.10] Zeal from Akron US.
[3938.86 → 3939.54] I'm sorry.
[3941.36 → 3942.20] The seam between
[3942.20 → 3942.90] the two sections
[3942.90 → 3943.48] is noticeable.
[3944.16 → 3944.90] Yeah, I know the
[3944.90 → 3945.78] seam between the two
[3945.78 → 3946.74] sections is noticeable.
[3946.86 → 3947.28] That's because they're
[3947.28 → 3948.30] made of different things.
[3948.84 → 3950.06] This part is made
[3950.06 → 3951.12] of salvaged screwdriver
[3951.12 → 3952.70] shaft, but the shaft
[3952.70 → 3953.60] is not the length
[3953.60 → 3954.20] of the whole pen.
[3954.20 → 3955.04] We had to machine
[3955.04 → 3955.72] a separate thing.
[3955.80 → 3956.40] That's why they're,
[3956.74 → 3957.64] they are separate things.
[3957.72 → 3958.08] Okay.
[3958.26 → 3959.86] Well, all right.
[3959.90 → 3960.52] Well, anyway,
[3960.94 → 3962.58] cool.
[3962.72 → 3963.12] Yeah, no,
[3963.16 → 3963.84] we wanted to reuse
[3963.84 → 3964.68] as much of the original
[3964.68 → 3965.72] material as possible.
[3965.72 → 3966.84] That's part of the
[3966.84 → 3968.58] coolness of the product
[3968.58 → 3970.42] is it's recycled materials.
[3971.80 → 3972.74] Along says,
[3972.84 → 3974.12] I wouldn't buy
[3974.12 → 3974.86] a five-star product
[3974.86 → 3975.48] that didn't have
[3975.48 → 3976.34] some critical reviews.
[3976.48 → 3976.96] That's fair.
[3977.28 → 3977.84] That's fair enough.
[3978.06 → 3978.88] Oh, that's going
[3978.88 → 3979.66] to be a fun video.
[3980.04 → 3981.56] Luke, we finally did it.
[3981.56 → 3984.12] We did the lowest rated PC.
[3984.28 → 3985.12] We shot it this week.
[3986.18 → 3988.62] So David scoured
[3988.62 → 3990.56] New egg for the worst
[3990.56 → 3992.48] product, the worst rated
[3992.48 → 3994.18] product in every category.
[3994.30 → 3996.46] And we built a PC using
[3996.46 → 3998.18] all the worst rated products.
[4000.48 → 4002.14] It went about as badly
[4002.14 → 4002.96] as you'd expect.
[4003.12 → 4005.76] Now we, we didn't take,
[4005.92 → 4006.88] we didn't take products
[4006.88 → 4007.92] that were one star,
[4007.92 → 4009.80] but just had one review
[4009.80 → 4010.70] and it was like defective.
[4011.12 → 4012.38] So I think our threshold
[4012.38 → 4013.42] was it had to have
[4013.42 → 4015.02] at least five reviews,
[4015.02 → 4016.56] but we ended up
[4016.56 → 4018.04] with a lot of twos and a half,
[4018.30 → 4019.58] three-star products.
[4019.92 → 4021.90] And without spoiling too much,
[4022.94 → 4023.90] David tested it
[4023.90 → 4024.94] to make sure everything worked
[4024.94 → 4026.92] and it didn't fully
[4026.92 → 4027.76] survive the shoot.
[4027.76 → 4031.56] Wow.
[4033.06 → 4033.64] It's good.
[4033.70 → 4034.28] Yeah, it's good.
[4034.32 → 4034.96] It's a fun video.
[4035.02 → 4035.70] It's going to be a good one.
[4036.22 → 4037.60] I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited
[4037.60 → 4038.64] for you guys to see that.
[4039.18 → 4039.62] Okay.
[4039.70 → 4040.32] Next topic.
[4041.24 → 4041.54] Nope.
[4042.18 → 4043.16] I have more community
[4043.16 → 4043.98] announcement things.
[4044.36 → 4045.04] Oh, okay.
[4045.04 → 4045.76] There's an article
[4045.76 → 4046.82] on the lab
[4046.82 → 4047.44] that was basically
[4047.44 → 4048.22] just published,
[4048.36 → 4049.58] which is a
[4049.58 → 4051.38] a deep dive
[4051.38 → 4051.76] into overclocking
[4052.46 → 4053.20] the new
[4053.20 → 4054.98] Ry zen 7 9700X.
[4054.98 → 4057.18] this is a first
[4057.18 → 4058.00] of its kind of like
[4058.00 → 4058.88] article type
[4058.88 → 4060.46] on the lab
[4060.46 → 4062.04] and it's very cool.
[4062.16 → 4062.92] You should check it out.
[4063.32 → 4064.42] And it's there.
[4064.52 → 4065.10] It's long.
[4065.24 → 4066.08] There's a lot of information.
[4066.44 → 4067.02] Scroll through it.
[4068.08 → 4069.26] Go, go faster.
[4070.30 → 4070.74] Speed.
[4071.70 → 4072.76] I am speed.
[4073.98 → 4075.14] I'm overclocked.
[4079.10 → 4080.52] This is as fast as I can go
[4080.52 → 4081.40] no matter how many watts
[4081.40 → 4081.92] you give me.
[4082.82 → 4083.80] I don't believe you.
[4084.98 → 4087.20] What about 4,500 amps?
[4088.00 → 4088.90] So if you guys are,
[4089.24 → 4092.96] I think that's what the mother,
[4092.96 → 4093.70] I think that's what
[4093.70 → 4094.18] the motherboards
[4094.18 → 4095.04] are giving the CPUs.
[4095.04 → 4095.40] Oh, okay, okay.
[4095.40 → 4095.64] Sorry.
[4096.68 → 4098.14] I went somewhere else
[4098.14 → 4098.42] with that.
[4098.50 → 4099.10] I thought it was going
[4099.10 → 4099.56] to be letters
[4099.56 → 4100.48] that spelled something
[4100.48 → 4100.88] or something.
[4101.14 → 4101.70] No, no.
[4101.88 → 4102.38] Way dumb.
[4102.58 → 4103.74] 8,008 amps
[4103.74 → 4104.50] or something like that.
[4104.58 → 4105.50] Can you turn off
[4105.50 → 4107.06] your phone notifications,
[4107.28 → 4107.42] please?
[4107.50 → 4107.64] Me?
[4107.80 → 4108.02] Yeah.
[4108.30 → 4109.00] Oh, thanks.
[4109.10 → 4109.76] Oh, is it his?
[4109.94 → 4110.26] Yeah.
[4110.46 → 4110.90] I don't even know
[4110.90 → 4111.54] where my phone is.
[4112.26 → 4112.80] Oh, there it is.
[4112.84 → 4113.60] It's under my leg.
[4113.60 → 4115.82] Um, fine.
[4116.44 → 4117.86] Oh, hold on.
[4117.88 → 4118.56] It's my wife, though.
[4118.58 → 4119.22] It might be important.
[4119.56 → 4120.14] One sec.
[4121.12 → 4121.90] Uh, okay.
[4122.50 → 4123.48] I don't know what that means.
[4123.70 → 4123.96] Cool.
[4124.50 → 4127.22] Um, oh, wait.
[4127.28 → 4128.36] No, there's, oh, there's more.
[4128.70 → 4130.32] Oh, oh, there's more.
[4130.32 → 4133.10] Uh, there's a tech hoarder's auction.
[4133.60 → 4134.72] We made a video
[4134.72 → 4136.80] where I went to David's house.
[4136.90 → 4137.72] Luke, do you know about this?
[4138.84 → 4141.64] Uh, I know you did something with this.
[4142.18 → 4143.04] David's moving.
[4143.68 → 4145.56] He's getting into the housing market,
[4145.66 → 4148.88] which means some of his retro collection,
[4148.88 → 4150.96] which he has accumulated over many years
[4150.96 → 4153.74] and spent thousands and thousands of dollars on,
[4153.74 → 4156.54] uh, some of his retro collection has to go.
[4156.54 → 4159.14] Now, he was thinking,
[4159.32 → 4161.12] hey, we did that tech hoarders video
[4161.12 → 4163.16] at Brian the electrician's place
[4163.16 → 4164.86] and people were pretty interested in, like,
[4165.16 → 4166.84] seeing me effectively go in
[4166.84 → 4168.08] and kind of shame people
[4168.08 → 4170.30] for all the stuff that they've accumulated,
[4170.52 → 4170.78] you know?
[4171.26 → 4173.38] Um, people really liked that format.
[4173.38 → 4174.60] And he was like,
[4174.88 → 4176.40] as much as this is, you know,
[4176.50 → 4178.58] me being the, the zoo exhibit
[4178.58 → 4179.36] that we're all gonna,
[4179.66 → 4180.94] ha, ha, at, you know,
[4181.20 → 4183.02] I think there's a tech hoarder here.
[4183.40 → 4185.66] So what he did was before I got there,
[4185.78 → 4186.62] he separated,
[4186.76 → 4188.52] he drew a line down the middle of the garage
[4188.52 → 4190.12] and he separated the stuff he was keeping
[4190.12 → 4192.64] from the stuff that he was going to auction
[4192.64 → 4195.52] in order to help pay for a gaming space
[4195.52 → 4196.60] in his new place
[4196.60 → 4198.52] and help pay for some of the
[4198.52 → 4200.08] uh, the fixing up that they need to do.
[4200.52 → 4201.38] And I was like,
[4201.42 → 4202.66] oh, that's super cool, David.
[4203.38 → 4206.98] But a big part of what you asked me here to do
[4206.98 → 4210.88] was to help you get rid of more of it.
[4211.30 → 4215.60] So he had boxes and boxes of retro games.
[4216.90 → 4219.68] And again, without spoiling too much,
[4220.28 → 4222.26] he got rid of a lot more
[4222.26 → 4224.46] than he had originally intended to.
[4224.68 → 4226.32] And he's going to,
[4226.42 → 4229.28] he's actually got everything that we went through
[4229.28 → 4230.68] and I made him get rid of
[4230.68 → 4233.00] up for auction right now.
[4233.38 → 4235.50] The original video or the video
[4235.50 → 4236.90] where we're going to look at his hoard
[4236.90 → 4239.16] is up on float plane right now.
[4240.36 → 4242.58] So I think that actually went live.
[4242.62 → 4243.06] Oh, shoot.
[4243.22 → 4244.58] I just closed full plane chat.
[4244.64 → 4245.12] Way to go, Linus.
[4245.26 → 4246.30] I think that went live.
[4246.36 → 4247.10] Yeah, that went live
[4247.10 → 4248.98] while we were on WAN show today.
[4249.38 → 4251.00] I'm auctioning his collection,
[4251.42 → 4252.32] Tech Hoarders 2.
[4253.60 → 4255.74] Absolutely incredible collection, guys.
[4255.74 → 4256.42] You're going to see,
[4256.54 → 4257.86] you're going to see some stuff.
[4258.28 → 4258.64] Okay?
[4259.02 → 4261.72] Like, why does he own Food Fight for Atari?
[4262.96 → 4263.32] Why?
[4263.92 → 4265.26] Why does he own...
[4265.26 → 4265.54] Classic.
[4265.54 → 4265.84] Classic.
[4266.22 → 4266.84] That sounds awesome.
[4267.04 → 4270.04] Why does he own Pimp My Ride for the PlayStation 2?
[4270.12 → 4270.52] Classic.
[4270.86 → 4271.20] Okay?
[4271.40 → 4272.10] Yeah, exactly.
[4272.10 → 4272.18] Exactly.
[4274.06 → 4276.34] So the video is live on float plane right now
[4276.34 → 4277.30] where you guys can check out
[4277.30 → 4278.20] what he's going to have for sale.
[4278.32 → 4280.46] I believe it's going up on YouTube tomorrow.
[4281.28 → 4282.92] We wanted to make sure people had time
[4282.92 → 4283.76] to bid on stuff though.
[4283.80 → 4285.08] So we're letting the WAN show know
[4285.08 → 4286.82] so they can go take a look right now.
[4287.18 → 4288.54] It's at urban auctions.
[4290.20 → 4291.98] And oh, the listings are dispersed
[4291.98 → 4293.82] among non-LTT listings.
[4293.82 → 4296.30] So we asked them to add an LTT keyword
[4296.30 → 4296.90] to the listings,
[4297.02 → 4297.84] but haven't heard back.
[4297.84 → 4299.36] So look for the listings
[4299.36 → 4301.98] with this gray hardwood as the background.
[4302.16 → 4302.74] Oh, good Lord.
[4303.14 → 4304.02] Okay, well, at any rate,
[4304.26 → 4306.10] if you go to urban auctions
[4306.10 → 4307.52] and then refined search
[4307.52 → 4308.68] and then LTT,
[4309.34 → 4310.98] basically anything here
[4310.98 → 4313.90] is a piece of David's collection.
[4314.22 → 4316.42] And there is some very,
[4316.60 → 4318.98] very interesting stuff in here, guys.
[4319.08 → 4322.54] Like, dude, it's kind of wild.
[4322.84 → 4324.02] Analog consoles,
[4324.88 → 4326.62] so many consoles,
[4326.62 → 4327.88] a lot of modded consoles
[4327.88 → 4329.40] that he personally modded.
[4331.50 → 4332.48] There was a lot of stuff
[4332.48 → 4333.56] that I was going to kind of
[4333.56 → 4334.48] attempt it to pick up.
[4334.66 → 4335.72] I'm not seeing Enhancer.
[4335.90 → 4338.60] He must be keeping it like a...
[4338.60 → 4340.44] Complete in box Final Fantasy VII.
[4341.04 → 4341.42] Oh, yeah.
[4342.20 → 4342.60] Man.
[4343.02 → 4344.38] There are some analog consoles
[4344.38 → 4345.62] that...
[4346.16 → 4351.16] I don't want to go into it so much.
[4351.46 → 4353.52] I have been trying to get them
[4353.52 → 4354.48] for a long time
[4354.48 → 4356.10] and talked to certain people
[4356.10 → 4357.64] and they said that I could get them
[4357.64 → 4359.98] and I have not found a route
[4359.98 → 4360.58] to getting them.
[4360.70 → 4362.30] I really wish Analog continued
[4362.30 → 4364.16] to make some of their older stuff.
[4366.06 → 4366.42] Okay.
[4366.56 → 4367.88] Hopefully they can figure that out eventually.
[4368.02 → 4368.24] Nope.
[4368.48 → 4370.38] The listings should all have LTT in them now.
[4370.82 → 4371.74] We have heard back,
[4371.94 → 4372.60] so it's all good.
[4373.42 → 4374.70] What auction site was it again?
[4374.70 → 4376.20] Urban Auctions.ca
[4376.20 → 4381.24] Dan, do you want to just throw that link
[4381.24 → 4381.78] in all the chats?
[4381.92 → 4382.02] Sure.
[4382.28 → 4382.52] Okay.
[4382.66 → 4383.88] Is there anything else
[4383.88 → 4384.78] that's on our list of announcements?
[4384.84 → 4385.12] Oh, yeah.
[4385.20 → 4386.32] Scrapyard Wars Part 3.
[4386.82 → 4388.10] Coming out soon on Float plane.
[4388.30 → 4389.10] Keep your eyes ready
[4389.10 → 4389.88] for that notification.
[4390.40 → 4391.62] Also, our Episode 3 giveaway
[4391.62 → 4392.80] is live now,
[4393.08 → 4394.64] ahead of us releasing Episode 3,
[4394.72 → 4395.56] and the prizes include
[4395.56 → 4397.28] two Jaw-editioned...
[4397.28 → 4397.44] Oh!
[4397.90 → 4399.06] Signed LTT Screwdrivers,
[4399.12 → 4400.24] which I will be signing
[4400.24 → 4401.56] right now, apparently.
[4401.56 → 4403.20] So, basically...
[4403.20 → 4405.02] Did we love-hug urban auctions,
[4405.32 → 4406.96] or is my internet just struggling?
[4407.78 → 4408.40] Uh-oh.
[4409.64 → 4411.06] It has been hugged.
[4411.30 → 4411.78] Okay.
[4412.78 → 4413.38] Whoops.
[4413.78 → 4414.78] Well, that's just typical.
[4415.08 → 4415.32] Sophie!
[4416.10 → 4417.06] Sorry, guys!
[4417.98 → 4418.46] There...
[4418.46 → 4418.80] Oh, no.
[4418.86 → 4419.22] There we go.
[4419.46 → 4420.10] It's just long.
[4420.86 → 4422.54] Anyway, we did a couple of screwdrivers
[4422.54 → 4424.22] in Jaw's colour scheme,
[4424.40 → 4426.86] and I'm going to sign them right now,
[4426.98 → 4428.86] and you can get a chance to win.
[4428.86 → 4429.84] All you've got to do
[4429.84 → 4431.30] is check out the link
[4431.30 → 4432.80] in the video description,
[4433.40 → 4435.12] which I assume is there,
[4435.56 → 4437.24] but I haven't actually looked for it,
[4437.32 → 4438.70] so good luck, everybody.
[4439.34 → 4439.52] Okay.
[4439.58 → 4439.86] Hold on.
[4439.92 → 4440.88] I'm back to my document now,
[4440.94 → 4441.50] so I will know.
[4441.86 → 4442.62] I will know!
[4443.32 → 4443.70] Uh, yeah.
[4443.78 → 4444.52] LEG.GG
[4444.52 → 4445.16] slash
[4445.16 → 4447.26] SAW
[4447.26 → 4448.20] giveaway3.
[4449.28 → 4450.06] They'll have even more
[4450.06 → 4451.08] screwdrivers to give away,
[4451.18 → 4452.30] along with a bunch of really cool
[4452.30 → 4453.10] and exclusive prizes,
[4453.18 → 4453.96] and we'll have everything linked
[4453.96 → 4454.44] in the description.
[4454.58 → 4455.30] Okay, okay, okay.
[4455.32 → 4455.78] I think we're good.
[4455.78 → 4456.78] I think that's all the...
[4456.78 → 4457.22] Good lord,
[4457.30 → 4458.22] is that ever a lot of announcements
[4458.22 → 4458.68] this week.
[4458.68 → 4459.60] All right.
[4460.40 → 4461.74] What do you want to do next?
[4464.40 → 4464.88] Uh...
[4464.88 → 4465.70] I believe in you, Luke.
[4465.74 → 4466.86] You're going to pick a perfect one.
[4467.04 → 4467.80] What about those things
[4467.80 → 4468.70] you're supposed to be signing?
[4469.10 → 4469.78] I just signed them.
[4469.98 → 4470.34] Okay, good.
[4470.58 → 4471.20] I wasn't paying attention.
[4471.28 → 4471.42] Goodbye.
[4472.38 → 4473.20] He's a fast boy.
[4474.32 → 4474.84] Um...
[4474.84 → 4476.56] Reddit CEO hints at
[4476.56 → 4477.78] paywalled Subreddits
[4477.78 → 4478.98] and AI search.
[4479.40 → 4481.58] An earnings call earlier this week...
[4481.58 → 4482.54] Luke, we're never going to know.
[4482.78 → 4483.38] No, no, no.
[4483.52 → 4483.96] No, no.
[4484.02 → 4484.84] We're never going to do
[4484.84 → 4485.88] the Good News WAN show
[4485.88 → 4486.44] at this rate.
[4486.44 → 4488.66] How dare you pick that topic?
[4489.44 → 4490.04] I don't think...
[4490.04 → 4491.20] I think we already haven't.
[4491.28 → 4492.24] Haven't we already covered
[4492.24 → 4492.94] negative things?
[4493.64 → 4494.04] I know.
[4494.16 → 4494.62] I just mean...
[4495.14 → 4497.10] It's never going to happen.
[4497.50 → 4498.14] No, just...
[4498.14 → 4499.00] Fine, fine.
[4499.04 → 4499.62] Just do it.
[4499.66 → 4500.24] I'm over it.
[4500.24 → 4505.54] In an earnings call earlier this week,
[4505.68 → 4507.52] CEO Steve Hoffman suggested
[4507.52 → 4508.56] that users could start
[4508.56 → 4510.24] to see paywalled areas of Reddit
[4510.24 → 4511.44] that may include
[4511.44 → 4513.34] exclusive or private content.
[4513.70 → 4515.04] Reddit will start testing...
[4515.04 → 4515.60] Oh, wow.
[4515.66 → 4516.32] That can actually do
[4516.32 → 4517.46] really, really well.
[4518.16 → 4519.40] Reddit will start testing
[4519.40 → 4520.60] AI-assisted search
[4520.60 → 4521.30] later this year
[4521.30 → 4522.32] using a mix of first
[4522.32 → 4523.80] and third-party AI models
[4523.80 → 4525.04] to provide search summaries.
[4525.60 → 4527.54] And Reddit went public
[4527.54 → 4528.60] in March of this year
[4528.60 → 4529.90] and has been aggressively pursuing
[4529.90 → 4530.94] new ways to monetize
[4530.94 → 4531.78] the site's content,
[4532.06 → 4532.84] which is created
[4532.84 → 4533.96] and moderated
[4533.96 → 4535.32] by their users,
[4535.44 → 4536.34] which is created, sorry.
[4537.48 → 4538.90] Increased API fees,
[4538.98 → 4540.04] which many third-party apps
[4540.04 → 4540.68] couldn't afford,
[4540.82 → 4542.34] so essentially just had to shut down,
[4542.70 → 4544.02] which I think was honestly,
[4544.20 → 4545.32] if we're being real,
[4545.60 → 4547.00] the play and what they wanted.
[4548.20 → 4549.66] They signed a deal with Google
[4549.66 → 4551.46] while blocking other search engines
[4551.46 → 4552.08] from crawling.
[4552.94 → 4554.10] Maybe this is, you know,
[4554.18 → 4555.12] part of why Google
[4555.12 → 4556.38] got crushed as a monopoly.
[4556.38 → 4558.32] And signed a deal
[4558.32 → 4558.94] with OpenAI
[4558.94 → 4560.48] allowing posts and comments
[4560.48 → 4562.90] to be used to train ChatGPT.
[4563.10 → 4563.94] They also increased
[4563.94 → 4564.70] the number of ads
[4564.70 → 4565.48] shown to users.
[4565.66 → 4566.70] They're currently testing
[4566.70 → 4568.24] ads within comments.
[4569.60 → 4570.68] And they're planning
[4570.68 → 4571.86] to include ads
[4571.86 → 4572.98] in search results.
[4573.88 → 4574.24] Yikes.
[4574.78 → 4576.10] Reddit's Q2 earnings
[4576.10 → 4578.32] reported a 54% increase
[4578.32 → 4579.86] in sales from the previous year
[4579.86 → 4581.16] with losses shrinking
[4581.16 → 4582.02] to $10 million
[4582.02 → 4584.38] from $41 million.
[4584.38 → 4586.28] Wow.
[4587.00 → 4587.70] Discussion question,
[4587.80 → 4588.46] why do we keep on
[4588.46 → 4589.14] putting up with Reddit?
[4589.72 → 4591.14] Well, because they crushed
[4591.14 → 4592.18] all the other competition,
[4592.38 → 4593.90] so there really isn't much anymore.
[4594.36 → 4594.62] Yeah.
[4594.84 → 4596.22] And we're at the point now
[4596.22 → 4597.28] where they've got that,
[4597.28 → 4599.34] they've got that incumbent advantage.
[4599.90 → 4600.78] Like you're,
[4600.94 → 4605.68] you're just not going to find
[4605.68 → 4607.44] information on,
[4607.44 → 4607.92] you know,
[4608.56 → 4610.70] PlayStation 3 modding
[4610.70 → 4612.20] on a new community
[4612.20 → 4613.58] that springs up tomorrow.
[4614.48 → 4614.76] You know?
[4614.92 → 4616.52] Not the same way
[4616.52 → 4617.82] that you will find
[4617.82 → 4618.46] this,
[4618.56 → 4620.38] this wealth of it
[4620.38 → 4621.70] that exists on Reddit
[4621.70 → 4622.46] from back when
[4622.46 → 4624.14] everyone was super into it.
[4624.72 → 4625.06] You know?
[4625.88 → 4626.48] Um,
[4627.16 → 4629.36] I just don't see,
[4629.70 → 4631.46] I just don't see a path
[4631.46 → 4632.56] forward
[4632.56 → 4633.36] other than
[4633.36 → 4636.10] just take it.
[4636.84 → 4637.28] Um,
[4638.28 → 4639.34] I don't know.
[4639.44 → 4639.70] And,
[4639.74 → 4640.30] and to be clear,
[4640.32 → 4640.98] I'm not saying that
[4640.98 → 4641.94] I want to do that.
[4642.12 → 4643.06] I'm just saying
[4643.06 → 4644.72] I don't see people standing up.
[4644.76 → 4644.96] I mean,
[4645.02 → 4645.26] Reddit
[4645.26 → 4647.48] already pulled moves
[4647.48 → 4647.96] that were
[4647.96 → 4649.20] deeply,
[4649.48 → 4650.70] deeply unpopular
[4650.70 → 4651.70] with their user base.
[4651.82 → 4653.28] And as far as I can tell,
[4653.44 → 4654.68] everyone just came
[4654.68 → 4656.24] crawling right back.
[4657.10 → 4657.88] Right back.
[4658.00 → 4658.38] I don't think they really
[4658.38 → 4659.22] even left.
[4660.00 → 4660.50] I mean,
[4660.52 → 4661.00] a couple of them
[4661.00 → 4661.94] shut down communities.
[4662.20 → 4662.68] You know that thing where like
[4662.68 → 4663.20] the
[4663.20 → 4664.24] the doom-scrolling manoeuvre
[4664.24 → 4665.36] when you like
[4665.36 → 4666.38] close an app
[4666.38 → 4667.72] and then pause
[4667.72 → 4668.44] for three seconds
[4668.44 → 4669.32] and open it again?
[4670.00 → 4670.88] Or you like,
[4670.98 → 4671.18] oh,
[4671.22 → 4672.00] I'm done with Reddit
[4672.00 → 4672.70] on my phone.
[4672.78 → 4673.74] I will now go on to
[4673.74 → 4674.80] Reddit on my computer.
[4675.08 → 4675.98] I feel like that's
[4675.98 → 4676.72] what users did.
[4676.88 → 4677.22] They're like,
[4677.26 → 4677.62] oh,
[4678.02 → 4678.98] I'm annoyed with Reddit.
[4679.10 → 4680.06] I'm going to close it
[4680.06 → 4681.64] and walk into another room
[4681.64 → 4682.40] and then open it again.
[4682.60 → 4682.98] Like I,
[4682.98 → 4683.94] I didn't notice anything
[4683.94 → 4684.78] even slow down.
[4686.78 → 4687.18] Ah.
[4688.38 → 4691.64] Oh well.
[4693.90 → 4694.88] In other news,
[4694.98 → 4695.66] still not good.
[4695.96 → 4697.38] Google kills the Chromecast
[4697.38 → 4698.48] introduces successor
[4698.48 → 4700.52] Google TV streamer.
[4700.84 → 4701.54] They can't just call it
[4701.54 → 4702.00] Google TV
[4702.00 → 4702.90] because they killed that
[4702.90 → 4703.66] in the past as well.
[4703.68 → 4704.46] I actually wasn't done
[4704.46 → 4705.18] talking about Reddit.
[4705.64 → 4706.66] They're going to kill it
[4706.66 → 4708.06] with private Subreddits
[4708.06 → 4710.20] and with monetized Subreddits
[4710.20 → 4711.46] because they're already
[4711.46 → 4712.78] very adult content friendly.
[4713.86 → 4714.68] So like,
[4715.24 → 4716.46] look out OnlyFans.
[4716.46 → 4719.18] I actually see them.
[4719.18 → 4719.24] Oh,
[4719.24 → 4719.80] I thought you meant
[4719.80 → 4720.58] they were going to kill it
[4720.58 → 4721.18] as in they were going
[4721.18 → 4721.86] to kill Reddit.
[4722.06 → 4722.28] No,
[4722.32 → 4722.96] they're going to crush it.
[4723.06 → 4724.20] enormous amounts of money
[4724.20 → 4724.76] from this.
[4725.64 → 4725.82] Yeah.
[4725.94 → 4726.08] Yeah.
[4726.56 → 4727.92] If I was OnlyFans,
[4728.02 → 4728.96] I would have my eye
[4728.96 → 4729.46] on this
[4729.46 → 4731.86] extremely closely.
[4733.06 → 4733.46] Yeah.
[4734.04 → 4735.06] Probably only one eye
[4735.06 → 4735.98] knowing OnlyFans.
[4735.98 → 4738.38] Next topic.
[4739.82 → 4740.12] Sorry,
[4740.16 → 4740.78] what has one eye?
[4740.84 → 4741.44] Is it a snake?
[4744.26 → 4745.54] Google kills Chromecast.
[4745.74 → 4746.42] On Tuesday,
[4746.82 → 4747.40] Google announced
[4747.40 → 4748.30] via their blog
[4748.30 → 4749.82] that Google TV streamer,
[4750.00 → 4751.18] a set-top box replacement
[4751.18 → 4752.28] for the Chromecast,
[4752.70 → 4754.10] a set-top box replacement
[4754.10 → 4757.04] for the handy little dongle?
[4757.50 → 4757.68] Gross.
[4758.02 → 4758.30] Yeah,
[4758.34 → 4758.60] I know,
[4758.66 → 4758.84] right?
[4758.92 → 4760.04] With added support
[4760.04 → 4762.70] for matter over thread.
[4762.70 → 4765.94] What?
[4767.54 → 4768.10] Anyway,
[4768.32 → 4769.86] the best of Google TV
[4769.86 → 4771.14] for AI-powered
[4771.14 → 4772.50] personalized entertainment.
[4773.02 → 4774.26] Google in the announcement.
[4774.40 → 4775.00] What changed?
[4775.38 → 4776.22] It's $100
[4776.22 → 4777.86] compared to a $50
[4777.86 → 4778.96] Chromecast 4K.
[4779.30 → 4780.76] They added an Ethernet port.
[4781.00 → 4781.48] Okay.
[4781.48 → 4782.48] Of unknown speed.
[4782.58 → 4784.34] I'm actually super into this.
[4785.36 → 4786.60] The fact that
[4786.60 → 4788.06] we were all Wi-Fi
[4788.06 → 4788.64] all the time
[4788.64 → 4789.40] for video streaming
[4789.40 → 4791.36] was phenomenally stupid.
[4791.50 → 4791.74] Oh, and there's Ethernet now?
[4792.08 → 4792.30] Yeah.
[4792.38 → 4792.54] Yeah.
[4792.70 → 4793.32] I do like that
[4793.32 → 4794.02] there's Ethernet now.
[4794.22 → 4794.84] I'm into this.
[4794.86 → 4795.28] I don't know if
[4795.28 → 4796.60] paying double the amount
[4796.60 → 4797.16] for Ethernet
[4797.16 → 4798.02] makes a ton of sense,
[4798.20 → 4800.98] but there's a 22% improvement
[4800.98 → 4802.00] in the SOC,
[4802.18 → 4803.02] but it's also just like
[4803.02 → 4803.78] a new product,
[4804.10 → 4805.34] so that's fine.
[4805.94 → 4807.24] They moved from
[4807.24 → 4808.50] Am logic SOC
[4808.50 → 4810.26] to the same MediaTek lineup
[4810.26 → 4812.06] used in the Amazon Fire Stick.
[4812.70 → 4812.88] Cool.
[4813.04 → 4814.30] So it's $100 Fire Stick.
[4814.32 → 4815.70] It no longer has an HDMI cable
[4815.70 → 4816.52] built in
[4816.52 → 4818.60] or any HDMI...
[4818.60 → 4818.76] Oh,
[4819.54 → 4820.96] got to not move stuff
[4820.96 → 4821.64] during...
[4821.64 → 4822.10] Oh, sorry.
[4822.10 → 4823.26] These are part of the same thing.
[4823.26 → 4823.92] I'm so sorry.
[4824.58 → 4824.98] Sorry, Luke.
[4825.00 → 4825.92] Where did it even go?
[4826.56 → 4826.88] I...
[4826.88 → 4828.04] It folded up
[4828.04 → 4829.00] with the Reddit CEO
[4829.00 → 4830.44] hints at Pay Weld Subreddits one.
[4831.02 → 4831.34] All right.
[4832.28 → 4833.28] Watch me mess with Luke
[4833.28 → 4833.90] and move it again.
[4834.06 → 4834.32] Sorry.
[4834.42 → 4834.66] Go ahead.
[4834.92 → 4835.14] All right.
[4835.20 → 4835.42] I mean,
[4835.42 → 4836.50] you can read it if you want.
[4836.84 → 4837.14] No, no.
[4837.20 → 4837.48] Go ahead.
[4838.70 → 4839.28] All right.
[4840.04 → 4840.40] Well,
[4840.44 → 4841.38] I have to find it again.
[4841.64 → 4842.48] So this is a fantastic...
[4842.48 → 4844.12] It no longer has an HDMI cable
[4844.12 → 4844.64] built in
[4844.64 → 4846.02] or any HDMI cable
[4846.02 → 4846.72] at all.
[4847.22 → 4847.94] Just a port.
[4848.24 → 4848.38] Okay.
[4848.38 → 4848.78] Did you find it?
[4850.34 → 4850.66] Yeah.
[4850.86 → 4852.00] Just a port is fine.
[4852.76 → 4854.80] I wonder if one comes in the box.
[4855.12 → 4855.34] No.
[4855.90 → 4856.34] Just a port.
[4856.34 → 4856.88] I kind of assume it would.
[4857.14 → 4857.38] Nope.
[4857.66 → 4858.18] Just a port.
[4859.48 → 4861.20] But it says no cable built in
[4861.20 → 4862.34] or with it at all.
[4862.54 → 4862.68] Yeah.
[4862.68 → 4863.06] Are you sure?
[4863.34 → 4863.58] Yeah.
[4864.00 → 4864.80] I know, right?
[4864.98 → 4865.26] Okay.
[4866.20 → 4866.96] It seems weird.
[4866.96 → 4867.14] I mean,
[4867.20 → 4868.92] things don't come with chargers anymore, Luke.
[4869.28 → 4869.62] Luke,
[4869.70 → 4870.86] things don't come with chargers.
[4871.04 → 4871.54] This is.
[4872.30 → 4872.66] Oh,
[4872.72 → 4872.88] well,
[4872.94 → 4873.34] it matters.
[4873.78 → 4875.42] It's a smart home thing
[4875.42 → 4876.80] and then I forget what thread is.
[4877.92 → 4878.22] Okay.
[4879.04 → 4880.46] FCC filing done
[4880.46 → 4882.16] by Quanta computers
[4882.16 → 4883.88] instead of directly from Google.
[4884.52 → 4884.90] Okay.
[4885.64 → 4887.72] The remote has a speaker now
[4887.72 → 4889.38] so that you can chime in
[4889.38 → 4890.14] when it gets lost.
[4890.24 → 4891.26] Chime in when it gets lost.
[4891.36 → 4891.54] Okay.
[4891.60 → 4892.80] That's actually neat.
[4893.16 → 4893.32] Yeah.
[4893.40 → 4893.78] That's very cool.
[4893.90 → 4894.76] And volume buttons move
[4894.76 → 4896.02] to the front of the remote
[4896.02 → 4897.64] instead of a rocker on the side.
[4897.64 → 4902.22] I don't love that it's a set-top box.
[4902.54 → 4903.62] I just hate that it's $100.
[4904.30 → 4905.48] I don't really see,
[4905.62 → 4907.10] I don't really see why this needed
[4907.10 → 4908.06] to be so much bigger
[4908.06 → 4909.16] and so much more expensive
[4909.16 → 4910.58] just to add an Ethernet port
[4910.58 → 4912.46] because from my point of view,
[4912.46 → 4913.92] that's all they've really done here.
[4915.30 → 4916.16] This is just,
[4916.24 → 4916.88] this is just,
[4917.02 → 4918.18] this is a price hike.
[4918.60 → 4919.02] That's,
[4919.10 → 4920.02] that's all it really is.
[4921.06 → 4922.34] Google TV streamers
[4922.34 → 4923.30] also,
[4923.54 → 4923.98] in my opinion,
[4924.16 → 4925.04] not a good name.
[4926.38 → 4926.78] Yeah.
[4927.02 → 4927.42] Chromecast.
[4927.42 → 4928.28] It's like a bad name
[4928.28 → 4928.94] in the sense where
[4928.94 → 4930.14] companies make bad names
[4930.14 → 4930.92] that are like impossible
[4930.92 → 4931.48] to decipher.
[4932.18 → 4932.54] It's just,
[4932.66 → 4934.06] it's so generic
[4934.06 → 4936.10] that searching for anything
[4936.10 → 4936.86] to do with it
[4936.86 → 4937.54] is going to bring up
[4937.54 → 4938.66] a bunch of other garbage,
[4938.82 → 4940.00] especially in Google's
[4940.00 → 4940.62] own search engine
[4940.62 → 4941.08] that sucks.
[4941.94 → 4942.38] Yes.
[4942.70 → 4943.36] It's just,
[4943.64 → 4943.78] yeah,
[4943.90 → 4944.88] Chromecast is like,
[4945.00 → 4945.78] it's catchy.
[4945.94 → 4946.82] Everyone knows what it is.
[4947.00 → 4948.38] I can see how it's kind of
[4948.38 → 4949.26] outdated these days
[4949.26 → 4950.40] because realistically,
[4950.60 → 4951.58] most of what you're doing
[4951.58 → 4952.36] with a Chromecast
[4952.36 → 4954.92] is not casting
[4954.92 → 4957.02] from a Chrome-enabled device.
[4957.44 → 4957.68] Like,
[4957.70 → 4959.52] it's kind of an outdated name,
[4959.86 → 4960.80] but it had such,
[4961.34 → 4961.48] it,
[4961.52 → 4962.14] it was,
[4962.26 → 4963.40] it's so well understood.
[4963.64 → 4963.80] Like,
[4963.82 → 4965.90] it has so much momentum already.
[4966.00 → 4966.56] I don't see why
[4966.56 → 4968.06] they wouldn't just call it
[4968.06 → 4970.06] Chromecast 2024.
[4970.26 → 4970.36] Like,
[4970.38 → 4970.80] just call it,
[4970.80 → 4971.14] call it,
[4971.14 → 4972.28] just call it Chromecast,
[4972.36 → 4972.88] even though,
[4973.02 → 4973.14] yeah,
[4973.18 → 4974.50] the Chrome casting part
[4974.50 → 4975.36] is not really the most
[4975.36 → 4976.12] important part of it.
[4976.12 → 4978.64] I just,
[4978.72 → 4979.52] I just don't see why
[4979.52 → 4980.30] this has to be $100.
[4981.04 → 4982.26] That's my biggest thing here.
[4986.68 → 4987.08] Yeah,
[4987.16 → 4988.46] somebody in Full plane chat
[4988.46 → 4990.02] said there's a lot more storage.
[4990.32 → 4991.50] I'm not sure about that.
[4992.68 → 4994.12] Why do you need a ton of storage
[4994.12 → 4995.02] on your Chromecast,
[4995.10 → 4995.28] though?
[4995.56 → 4996.10] I didn't,
[4996.16 → 4997.30] I didn't know Chromecast
[4997.30 → 4998.24] had any storage.
[4998.50 → 4998.82] They do.
[4999.00 → 4999.58] And I never wanted
[4999.58 → 5000.26] any storage.
[5000.52 → 5001.90] You can run emulated games
[5001.90 → 5002.58] on them and stuff,
[5002.62 → 5002.94] I think.
[5004.18 → 5005.30] On Chromecast?
[5005.44 → 5006.16] I think so.
[5006.70 → 5007.38] Android games.
[5007.50 → 5007.70] Yeah.
[5008.58 → 5008.82] Yep.
[5009.78 → 5009.96] Yeah,
[5009.96 → 5011.24] it has 32 gigs of storage,
[5011.40 → 5012.54] so that's something.
[5013.46 → 5013.94] But like,
[5014.48 → 5016.00] does 32 gigs of storage cost?
[5016.60 → 5018.20] That's practically nothing
[5018.20 → 5019.10] in the modern day.
[5019.78 → 5020.10] Yeah,
[5020.24 → 5020.84] I don't know,
[5020.84 → 5021.20] guys.
[5023.12 → 5023.56] Yeah,
[5023.58 → 5024.56] the hardware specs suck.
[5024.64 → 5025.74] It's like marginally faster
[5025.74 → 5026.84] than the old one.
[5026.84 → 5030.66] ONI Heroic says,
[5030.78 → 5031.74] I just want a streaming box
[5031.74 → 5032.72] experience without any
[5032.72 → 5033.64] attachment to Fang.
[5034.78 → 5035.62] I mean,
[5035.78 → 5037.28] what are you going to
[5037.28 → 5038.00] stream from
[5038.00 → 5039.44] that isn't going to
[5039.44 → 5040.00] come from,
[5040.14 → 5040.56] what is it,
[5040.60 → 5040.86] Facebook,
[5041.02 → 5041.38] Amazon,
[5042.02 → 5042.44] Apple,
[5042.56 → 5042.86] Netflix,
[5043.06 → 5043.22] Google?
[5043.32 → 5043.44] Like,
[5043.46 → 5043.72] come on.
[5044.64 → 5045.96] What is the new
[5045.96 → 5046.68] Fang acronym?
[5046.78 → 5047.66] I think there's a new one.
[5049.10 → 5049.50] Yeah,
[5049.50 → 5050.50] I don't remember what it is,
[5050.82 → 5050.98] but.
[5051.10 → 5051.26] Yeah,
[5051.54 → 5052.02] I don't know,
[5052.12 → 5052.60] I don't know what the
[5052.60 → 5053.32] latest one is.
[5054.30 → 5054.56] Yeah.
[5054.56 → 5057.34] All right.
[5057.74 → 5060.10] Corsair has ditched 80 plus.
[5060.54 → 5062.66] They are dropping the widely
[5062.66 → 5064.66] recognized 80 plus power supply
[5064.66 → 5066.30] certification for the newer,
[5066.46 → 5068.86] more comprehensive cybernetics
[5068.86 → 5069.96] lab certification.
[5070.66 → 5073.00] So 80 plus actually doesn't
[5073.00 → 5073.70] measure much.
[5073.86 → 5075.48] It measures the efficiency of a
[5075.48 → 5076.98] power supply at four different
[5076.98 → 5077.58] load levels,
[5077.92 → 5078.10] 10,
[5078.18 → 5078.38] 20,
[5078.48 → 5078.72] 50,
[5078.78 → 5079.84] and 100%.
[5079.84 → 5081.84] Cybernetics applies more than
[5081.84 → 5084.14] 1,450 different load
[5084.14 → 5085.46] combinations to devices under
[5085.46 → 5087.32] test and considers efficiency,
[5087.46 → 5087.98] power factor,
[5088.06 → 5089.96] and noise level in its ratings.
[5091.12 → 5091.64] Oh,
[5092.02 → 5093.74] bonus results comparison.
[5093.92 → 5094.40] What is this?
[5095.66 → 5096.04] Oh,
[5096.22 → 5096.88] interesting.
[5097.70 → 5100.34] We've got the same power supply
[5100.34 → 5102.62] evaluated by 80 plus
[5102.62 → 5105.54] cybernetics and LTT labs.
[5106.92 → 5108.06] That's kind of cool.
[5110.16 → 5111.02] Here we go.
[5111.14 → 5111.46] Okay.
[5111.70 → 5111.84] Yeah,
[5111.84 → 5112.38] I'm screen sharing.
[5113.06 → 5117.14] So this is the report from 80 plus
[5117.14 → 5121.12] on the Sea sonic Focus 750 watt.
[5121.86 → 5122.96] The GO 750.
[5123.60 → 5123.78] Oh,
[5123.80 → 5123.94] yeah.
[5124.06 → 5124.42] Sorry.
[5125.90 → 5127.92] GO 750 from Sea sonic.
[5128.40 → 5131.26] So basically input power,
[5131.34 → 5131.90] output power.
[5132.12 → 5133.34] So efficiency,
[5133.70 → 5134.12] efficiency.
[5134.12 → 5137.20] It's all pretty much just efficiency.
[5137.76 → 5138.04] Okay.
[5138.40 → 5140.50] Here is cybernetics.
[5142.48 → 5144.82] Already looks more for real.
[5146.34 → 5147.74] Cables and connectors.
[5148.50 → 5149.44] Gauge of the wires.
[5149.68 → 5151.30] This is actually pretty important
[5151.30 → 5154.82] because I don't know if I ever saw
[5154.82 → 5156.58] a switcheroo where a manufacturer
[5156.58 → 5158.72] changed the gauge of the wires,
[5158.92 → 5161.20] but we definitely saw ones back in the day
[5161.20 → 5163.30] where manufacturers would submit
[5163.30 → 5165.26] for certification with shorter wires,
[5165.26 → 5167.52] and then they would ship with longer ones
[5167.52 → 5168.74] that were better for cable management,
[5168.86 → 5170.72] but those shorter wires would allow them
[5170.72 → 5172.60] to get better efficiency
[5172.60 → 5174.26] and a better 80 plus rating.
[5175.26 → 5176.18] Average efficiency.
[5177.18 → 5177.62] Okay.
[5177.92 → 5178.20] Cool.
[5178.38 → 5178.58] Cool.
[5178.72 → 5178.88] Cool.
[5178.98 → 5179.20] Cool.
[5181.20 → 5181.68] Hmm.
[5183.82 → 5184.74] AC loss.
[5184.92 → 5185.88] Hold up time.
[5187.64 → 5188.48] Vampire power.
[5188.48 → 5191.18] Oh, efficiency graph.
[5192.50 → 5194.14] Oh, that's kind of cool.
[5194.86 → 5199.28] So minor rails versus major rails
[5199.28 → 5201.64] versus 12 volt rail.
[5202.60 → 5203.60] Because if you have,
[5203.92 → 5205.28] there were some power supplies,
[5205.40 → 5206.40] especially back in the day,
[5206.40 → 5208.90] where if you had absolutely no load on them
[5208.90 → 5210.32] outside the 12 volt rail,
[5210.66 → 5212.60] they would really struggle.
[5212.84 → 5215.34] Like they expected to be evenly loaded.
[5215.34 → 5217.50] It's not nearly as much of an issue today,
[5217.62 → 5219.28] but how much of an issue is it?
[5219.38 → 5220.46] Well, you'll only know
[5220.46 → 5223.10] if you look at proper power supply testing.
[5223.16 → 5223.76] This is great.
[5223.86 → 5227.26] I actually have been very pleased
[5227.26 → 5231.20] to see cybernetics start to horn in
[5231.20 → 5233.12] on 80 pluses monopoly
[5233.12 → 5235.78] and sort of validating power supplies.
[5236.34 → 5237.90] And to see Corsair come out
[5237.90 → 5241.64] and be supportive of this is just great.
[5241.64 → 5245.72] Let's do away with this meaningless certification
[5245.72 → 5247.56] that doesn't really help people
[5247.56 → 5249.76] properly understand the difference
[5249.76 → 5251.26] between a good and a bad power supply
[5251.26 → 5255.34] and try to support more comprehensive testing
[5255.34 → 5256.76] so that people really know what they're buying.
[5257.44 → 5258.38] And then moving on,
[5258.44 → 5261.06] we've got LTT Labs overview
[5261.06 → 5263.76] of the same power supply.
[5264.82 → 5266.76] So there are things that
[5266.76 → 5269.34] we are interested in
[5269.34 → 5271.62] that cybernetics isn't necessarily.
[5272.42 → 5274.14] I don't know if we've actually
[5274.14 → 5275.26] got that rolled out yet,
[5275.26 → 5275.98] but one of the things
[5275.98 → 5277.34] that I know we're working on
[5277.34 → 5281.08] is a look at the lengths
[5281.08 → 5282.12] of all the cables.
[5284.18 → 5285.90] Yeah, so we don't have that rolled out yet.
[5286.04 → 5288.02] So that's hopefully coming in the future.
[5290.48 → 5292.14] And you're really going to have to,
[5292.18 → 5293.82] oh man, we're going to have to scroll a lot.
[5293.82 → 5299.14] Brown out, hold up duration.
[5299.62 → 5299.90] Cool.
[5302.64 → 5303.82] Good job, cybernetics.
[5304.78 → 5305.44] Stay real.
[5306.78 → 5307.96] Okay, what else we got today?
[5311.12 → 5312.14] What do we do next?
[5312.14 → 5315.84] XWAR2 asks,
[5315.94 → 5317.38] would you give an LTT Labs
[5317.38 → 5319.42] certification stamp in the future?
[5320.20 → 5322.08] We've talked about that as a possibility.
[5323.46 → 5324.38] Right now,
[5325.28 → 5326.34] that is not,
[5327.12 → 5329.70] right now that's not something
[5329.70 → 5330.46] that's on our roadmap.
[5330.64 → 5332.32] I think we still have a lot of work to do
[5332.32 → 5336.64] to expand our testing
[5336.64 → 5337.94] across more verticals,
[5338.02 → 5339.38] to go deeper into testing
[5339.38 → 5340.36] in some of the verticals
[5340.36 → 5341.32] that we already test.
[5342.98 → 5344.28] Standardize some of our testing.
[5344.68 → 5345.80] Build up our team
[5345.80 → 5347.42] to have
[5347.42 → 5351.72] more backup
[5351.72 → 5353.40] so that we can test
[5353.40 → 5354.96] more products in the queue at once.
[5355.08 → 5356.02] Like there's so much
[5356.02 → 5356.68] that we have to do
[5356.68 → 5358.16] before I think we're going to try
[5358.16 → 5359.06] and develop a program
[5359.06 → 5360.68] where we boil down
[5360.68 → 5361.82] the quality of a product
[5361.82 → 5363.54] to like a simple badge
[5363.54 → 5364.24] or colour code
[5364.24 → 5364.90] or a grade
[5364.90 → 5366.22] or something like that.
[5367.06 → 5368.12] That kind of makes sense?
[5368.12 → 5370.00] Is that kind of line
[5370.00 → 5372.84] interim head of labs?
[5373.00 → 5373.62] Maybe I should have let you
[5373.62 → 5374.30] answer that question.
[5374.42 → 5374.54] Whoops.
[5375.74 → 5377.10] I don't think we've talked
[5377.10 → 5377.82] about that publicly,
[5377.92 → 5378.36] by the way.
[5382.04 → 5382.42] Well,
[5382.54 → 5383.14] got to go.
[5387.96 → 5389.26] Should I pick another topic?
[5389.26 → 5392.48] Nice.
[5392.52 → 5392.96] It's just me.
[5393.04 → 5393.32] Perfect.
[5393.62 → 5394.24] Hardware hackers
[5394.24 → 5394.96] develop method
[5394.96 → 5396.14] for restoring software
[5396.14 → 5397.16] bricked first-gen
[5397.16 → 5398.32] Apple HomePods.
[5399.08 → 5400.12] Many users have,
[5400.24 → 5401.54] many users of the original
[5401.54 → 5402.16] HomePod
[5402.16 → 5404.16] have had their units
[5404.16 → 5404.62] bricked
[5404.62 → 5406.16] due to software errors.
[5406.26 → 5406.90] I'm not going to address
[5406.90 → 5407.36] that at all.
[5407.74 → 5409.36] Don't have USB ports,
[5409.36 → 5410.60] only a proprietary connector
[5410.60 → 5411.90] hidden under the base
[5411.90 → 5413.82] used by Apple
[5413.82 → 5414.78] for diagnostics.
[5415.14 → 5416.50] And Apple's only response
[5416.50 → 5417.88] to bricked HomePods
[5417.88 → 5419.08] has been to
[5419.08 → 5420.10] charge users
[5420.10 → 5421.26] for out-of-warranty
[5421.26 → 5422.30] repairs and replacements,
[5422.64 → 5423.24] leaving users
[5423.24 → 5424.80] with no other options
[5424.80 → 5426.64] until now.
[5426.78 → 5427.16] I'm not,
[5427.24 → 5427.40] no,
[5427.50 → 5428.08] I see chat,
[5428.14 → 5429.16] I'm not addressing it.
[5429.84 → 5430.86] Repair guy
[5430.86 → 5432.00] Mix Fix
[5432.00 → 5432.66] in collaboration
[5432.66 → 5433.22] with,
[5433.88 → 5434.40] whoa,
[5434.64 → 5435.62] how do I say that name?
[5436.14 → 5436.66] David
[5436.66 → 5439.24] Rizal?
[5440.54 → 5441.06] Rizal?
[5441.42 → 5442.16] Not sure.
[5442.16 → 5444.24] And Thirst
[5444.24 → 5444.80] figured out
[5444.80 → 5445.56] how to open
[5445.56 → 5447.00] the HomePod up,
[5447.32 → 5448.16] access the port,
[5448.46 → 5449.68] and fix the software.
[5450.18 → 5450.66] He's published
[5450.66 → 5451.54] detailed instructions
[5451.54 → 5452.62] on how to fix it yourself,
[5452.78 → 5454.26] or you can just ship it
[5454.26 → 5455.52] and pay for him to do it.
[5455.98 → 5457.08] The detailed instructions
[5457.08 → 5458.04] are on GitHub.
[5459.72 → 5460.58] If you look for
[5460.58 → 5462.02] HomePod-Restore
[5462.02 → 5462.52] on GitHub,
[5462.64 → 5463.06] you should be able
[5463.06 → 5463.52] to find it.
[5464.08 → 5464.82] Very cool project.
[5465.88 → 5467.00] Is he coming back,
[5467.12 → 5467.22] Dan?
[5470.10 → 5470.54] Hello?
[5471.08 → 5472.14] Is everyone gone?
[5473.16 → 5473.68] Sorry,
[5473.76 → 5473.92] what?
[5474.86 → 5476.18] Is Linus coming back?
[5476.48 → 5476.74] Who?
[5477.80 → 5478.90] Oh my goodness.
[5479.78 → 5480.64] Oh my goodness.
[5481.92 → 5482.20] Okay,
[5482.34 → 5483.38] I can keep doing topics.
[5483.48 → 5483.92] I'm going to keep
[5483.92 → 5484.46] ignoring it.
[5485.32 → 5486.92] RIP Game Informer.
[5487.00 → 5488.16] After 33 years,
[5488.16 → 5488.96] the longest
[5488.96 → 5491.16] running
[5492.08 → 5492.50] U.S.
[5492.58 → 5493.22] gaming magazine
[5493.22 → 5494.54] is gone.
[5495.08 → 5495.62] GameStop,
[5495.72 → 5496.20] who acquired
[5496.20 → 5496.70] the magazine
[5496.70 → 5497.64] in 2000,
[5497.94 → 5498.74] has laid off
[5498.74 → 5500.00] all 13
[5500.00 → 5500.88] staff members.
[5500.88 → 5501.96] This comes after
[5501.96 → 5502.76] multiple rounds
[5502.76 → 5503.24] of layoffs
[5503.24 → 5504.06] since 2018,
[5504.06 → 5505.70] and as a final slap
[5505.70 → 5506.46] in the face
[5506.46 → 5507.10] to the staff,
[5507.36 → 5508.18] the farewell message
[5508.18 → 5508.84] wasn't written
[5508.84 → 5509.78] by anyone
[5509.78 → 5511.22] at Game Informer
[5511.22 → 5512.06] and looks like
[5512.06 → 5512.62] it was written
[5512.62 → 5513.38] by AI.
[5516.38 → 5516.94] Apparently,
[5517.16 → 5517.96] the next issue
[5517.96 → 5519.30] was about 70%
[5519.30 → 5520.38] complete when the layoffs
[5520.38 → 5520.88] were announced,
[5521.44 → 5522.30] and a group led
[5522.30 → 5523.74] by former GI,
[5523.94 → 5524.62] or Game Informer
[5524.62 → 5525.20] video producer,
[5525.32 → 5525.94] Ben Hansen,
[5526.10 → 5526.78] is now attempting
[5526.78 → 5527.94] to preserve as much
[5527.94 → 5528.70] of the publications
[5528.70 → 5529.74] as possible.
[5534.96 → 5535.40] Sorry,
[5535.52 → 5535.64] Luke,
[5535.70 → 5536.34] I'd love to talk
[5536.34 → 5536.96] in more detail
[5536.96 → 5537.74] about what we were
[5537.74 → 5538.44] talking about before,
[5538.52 → 5539.20] but I have some
[5539.20 → 5539.90] Wilkes to you.
[5544.30 → 5544.74] Wow,
[5544.84 → 5545.86] that's a lot.
[5546.08 → 5546.34] Wow,
[5546.48 → 5547.48] that's a lot.
[5548.58 → 5549.28] You do like
[5549.28 → 5549.92] chubby bunny
[5549.92 → 5550.56] with Wilkes.
[5551.96 → 5552.70] Try to say it.
[5552.76 → 5553.40] Say chubby bunny.
[5553.40 → 5557.24] chubby bunny.
[5560.04 → 5561.18] That might be a first.
[5562.72 → 5563.10] Sorry,
[5563.26 → 5563.46] but,
[5563.52 → 5563.90] yeah,
[5564.04 → 5564.34] so,
[5564.60 → 5565.34] we're saying
[5565.34 → 5566.12] this is a lab.
[5567.22 → 5567.58] No,
[5567.72 → 5568.32] we're talking about
[5568.32 → 5570.48] RIP Game Informer
[5570.48 → 5570.80] right now.
[5575.32 → 5576.20] That's gnarly.
[5579.88 → 5580.28] Oh,
[5580.34 → 5580.58] man.
[5580.58 → 5583.02] What is,
[5583.14 → 5583.58] what is that?
[5586.74 → 5587.98] There's a podcast
[5587.98 → 5589.46] that releases
[5589.46 → 5590.46] an episode
[5590.46 → 5591.58] like once a decade
[5591.58 → 5592.56] as far as I can tell,
[5593.08 → 5596.10] but I like it a lot.
[5596.26 → 5596.78] It's called
[5596.78 → 5597.68] A Life Well Wasted,
[5598.08 → 5598.88] and they have
[5598.88 → 5599.58] an episode,
[5600.50 → 5601.66] their first episode
[5601.66 → 5602.32] ever is called
[5602.32 → 5603.30] The Death of EGG
[5603.30 → 5604.90] or Electronic Gaming
[5604.90 → 5605.32] Monthly,
[5605.74 → 5606.80] and it's actually
[5606.80 → 5608.14] a really cool
[5608.14 → 5609.74] look into the closure
[5609.74 → 5610.52] of one of these
[5610.52 → 5611.46] old gaming magazines.
[5612.90 → 5613.92] I would
[5613.92 → 5614.94] highly recommend
[5614.94 → 5615.72] listening to it.
[5616.46 → 5617.32] It's old,
[5617.72 → 5618.08] so,
[5618.22 → 5618.48] you know,
[5618.54 → 5619.32] keep that in mind.
[5619.74 → 5620.58] It's from like
[5620.58 → 5621.62] 2013 or something.
[5622.92 → 5623.40] But,
[5623.90 → 5624.14] yeah,
[5624.38 → 5625.06] it sucks
[5625.06 → 5625.54] when these types
[5625.54 → 5626.08] of publications
[5626.08 → 5626.68] go down,
[5627.64 → 5627.72] and
[5627.72 → 5630.90] the
[5630.90 → 5631.14] like,
[5631.44 → 5631.74] somewhat
[5631.74 → 5633.02] death of modern
[5633.02 → 5633.46] journalism
[5633.46 → 5634.14] has been
[5634.14 → 5634.96] unfortunate.
[5634.96 → 5637.80] discussion question
[5637.80 → 5638.00] is,
[5638.12 → 5638.52] what are some
[5638.52 → 5639.30] gaming magazines
[5639.30 → 5640.02] or websites
[5640.02 → 5640.70] that you,
[5640.96 → 5641.64] and then in brackets,
[5641.96 → 5642.38] audience,
[5642.98 → 5643.28] miss,
[5643.64 → 5644.32] and where can
[5644.32 → 5645.28] the people go
[5645.28 → 5646.82] today for news
[5646.82 → 5647.30] reviews and
[5647.30 → 5647.82] previews?
[5648.68 → 5649.02] Well,
[5649.12 → 5650.02] some gaming news
[5650.02 → 5650.94] you can get from
[5650.94 → 5651.66] Game linked.
[5651.84 → 5652.44] Other than that,
[5652.54 → 5652.84] there's,
[5653.34 → 5653.82] like,
[5653.94 → 5654.66] Game Ranks is a
[5654.66 → 5655.64] really awesome
[5655.64 → 5656.36] YouTube channel
[5656.36 → 5656.94] for gaming stuff
[5656.94 → 5657.94] that I've watched
[5657.94 → 5658.62] over the years.
[5660.96 → 5661.70] Those guys have
[5661.70 → 5662.96] always been great.
[5662.96 → 5664.04] I got all my
[5664.04 → 5664.60] game news from
[5664.60 → 5665.44] Yankee.
[5665.76 → 5666.68] From Yankee,
[5666.80 → 5667.34] Zero Punk.
[5668.00 → 5668.44] No,
[5668.50 → 5668.64] no,
[5668.64 → 5668.84] no,
[5668.84 → 5669.00] no,
[5669.00 → 5669.34] not fully
[5669.34 → 5669.90] emblematic.
[5670.92 → 5671.32] Oh,
[5671.42 → 5671.70] right,
[5672.02 → 5672.26] right.
[5672.66 → 5673.06] There was the
[5673.06 → 5673.44] whole fallout
[5673.44 → 5674.02] with The Escapist.
[5674.94 → 5675.22] Yes.
[5678.36 → 5678.76] Yeah,
[5678.88 → 5680.00] I think it's
[5680.00 → 5680.64] genuinely,
[5680.64 → 5681.36] like,
[5681.50 → 5682.28] mostly YouTubers
[5682.28 → 5682.86] these days,
[5682.98 → 5683.84] which is kind
[5683.84 → 5684.18] of weird,
[5684.46 → 5684.68] but.
[5685.12 → 5685.30] Well,
[5685.32 → 5685.48] I mean,
[5685.52 → 5686.08] that's where the
[5686.08 → 5686.50] money is.
[5686.54 → 5687.04] It's hard to make
[5687.04 → 5687.56] money in written.
[5687.96 → 5688.38] It's not,
[5688.52 → 5688.72] yep,
[5689.26 → 5689.78] it's not a secret.
[5689.88 → 5690.56] We've talked about it
[5690.56 → 5691.60] so many times on the
[5691.60 → 5691.78] show.
[5691.86 → 5692.74] It's not a mystery.
[5692.96 → 5693.92] why written
[5693.92 → 5694.68] publications are
[5694.68 → 5694.98] struggling,
[5694.98 → 5695.78] because you can't
[5695.78 → 5696.80] make money with
[5696.80 → 5697.76] unobtrusive ads,
[5698.00 → 5699.62] and people are
[5699.62 → 5700.34] going to block
[5700.34 → 5701.54] the obtrusive ads
[5701.54 → 5702.24] that you can make
[5702.24 → 5703.10] money with,
[5703.34 → 5705.22] so your options
[5705.22 → 5708.24] are just
[5708.24 → 5709.32] don't make money
[5709.32 → 5713.14] or go under.
[5713.24 → 5713.72] I remember,
[5713.96 → 5714.06] like,
[5714.32 → 5715.16] so I'm in Vegas
[5715.16 → 5715.66] right now
[5715.66 → 5717.02] for DEFCON,
[5717.02 → 5718.62] and I remember
[5718.62 → 5719.20] there was one
[5719.20 → 5720.34] time when I was
[5720.34 → 5721.10] a lot younger,
[5721.46 → 5722.42] when I was flying,
[5722.60 → 5724.18] I had a layover
[5724.18 → 5725.24] in Vegas
[5725.24 → 5725.48] for,
[5725.58 → 5725.62] like,
[5725.64 → 5726.24] a few hours.
[5727.26 → 5727.92] I didn't have
[5727.92 → 5728.44] a ton of money
[5728.44 → 5728.98] at the time,
[5729.08 → 5730.46] but I was stuck
[5730.46 → 5730.96] in the airport.
[5731.10 → 5731.44] I wasn't going
[5731.44 → 5732.12] to leave the airport
[5732.12 → 5732.70] even though I was
[5732.70 → 5733.02] here for,
[5733.12 → 5733.18] like,
[5733.22 → 5733.52] I think it was,
[5733.60 → 5733.64] like,
[5733.64 → 5734.12] four or five
[5734.12 → 5734.76] hours or something,
[5734.84 → 5734.94] because,
[5735.04 → 5735.10] like,
[5735.10 → 5735.52] what was I going
[5735.52 → 5736.10] to do in Vegas
[5736.10 → 5736.36] when I'm,
[5736.48 → 5736.50] like,
[5736.54 → 5736.84] 16?
[5738.46 → 5739.30] So I entertained
[5739.30 → 5740.60] myself by buying,
[5740.82 → 5741.58] I think it was,
[5741.76 → 5741.80] like,
[5741.88 → 5742.66] I don't know,
[5742.74 → 5742.90] like,
[5742.94 → 5744.04] a PC Gamer magazine
[5744.04 → 5745.44] or Xbox magazine
[5745.44 → 5745.86] or something
[5745.86 → 5746.32] at the time,
[5746.84 → 5748.36] because that was
[5748.36 → 5748.88] something I used
[5748.88 → 5749.40] to enjoy.
[5749.64 → 5750.64] I remember I had
[5750.64 → 5751.20] the
[5751.60 → 5752.00] I think it was
[5752.00 → 5753.16] the Xbox magazine
[5753.16 → 5754.82] article that was
[5754.82 → 5755.08] the
[5755.24 → 5755.44] like,
[5756.06 → 5757.06] all the pre-release
[5757.06 → 5758.42] information for Halo 2.
[5758.68 → 5759.68] I read that thing
[5759.68 → 5760.72] so many times.
[5761.40 → 5761.70] Oh,
[5761.74 → 5762.02] man.
[5762.32 → 5763.14] I used to really
[5763.14 → 5763.74] like the gaming
[5763.74 → 5764.22] magazines.
[5764.62 → 5766.00] I liked having
[5766.00 → 5767.30] columns in them
[5767.30 → 5767.88] that were written
[5767.88 → 5769.60] by the same people
[5769.60 → 5770.10] all the time,
[5770.12 → 5770.72] so you knew,
[5770.72 → 5770.94] like,
[5771.00 → 5771.50] what kind of,
[5771.50 → 5772.54] what kind of writer
[5772.54 → 5773.44] that person was,
[5773.50 → 5773.92] so you could,
[5774.04 → 5774.58] you could almost
[5774.58 → 5775.56] read it in their voice,
[5775.64 → 5776.34] all that type of stuff.
[5776.38 → 5776.56] It was,
[5776.64 → 5776.72] like,
[5776.78 → 5777.66] pre-YouTube for,
[5777.80 → 5778.62] for me,
[5778.68 → 5779.70] for gaming news content.
[5781.16 → 5781.56] Yeah,
[5781.64 → 5782.04] I don't know.
[5782.32 → 5782.66] Sad,
[5782.82 → 5784.34] but the world
[5784.34 → 5784.96] keeps moving.
[5785.32 → 5785.72] Apparently,
[5786.04 → 5787.16] Second Wind Group
[5787.16 → 5789.00] is in hot water
[5789.00 → 5789.68] now as well.
[5789.78 → 5790.76] I have no idea
[5790.76 → 5794.46] how much of,
[5794.58 → 5795.98] I don't know much more
[5795.98 → 5797.52] beyond one of their
[5797.52 → 5799.24] creators just resigned
[5799.24 → 5799.72] following,
[5799.72 → 5800.16] apparently,
[5800.32 → 5800.90] a couple others
[5800.90 → 5801.54] who resigned.
[5802.22 → 5803.20] Good gravy.
[5803.20 → 5805.94] All right.
[5806.54 → 5807.14] Cool.
[5807.62 → 5807.84] Well,
[5807.90 → 5808.22] good luck,
[5808.30 → 5808.62] everybody.
[5809.76 → 5809.94] Oh,
[5810.00 → 5810.26] boy.
[5814.62 → 5815.50] Go watch
[5815.50 → 5815.96] Game Link.
[5816.30 → 5816.76] Yeah.
[5817.56 → 5817.92] Okay.
[5822.88 → 5823.86] Next topic.
[5823.86 → 5826.58] Oh,
[5826.64 → 5827.26] we're supposed to do
[5827.26 → 5827.70] sponsors.
[5827.98 → 5829.22] Speaking of keeping
[5829.22 → 5830.82] a sustainable business
[5830.82 → 5831.12] going,
[5831.58 → 5832.12] the show is brought
[5832.12 → 5832.52] to you today
[5832.52 → 5833.60] by MSI.
[5834.60 → 5835.44] Are you dying
[5835.44 → 5836.26] to mess
[5836.26 → 5836.98] with the impaler
[5836.98 → 5837.74] over and over
[5837.74 → 5839.20] because you failed
[5839.20 → 5839.92] to get good?
[5841.50 → 5841.98] Wow,
[5842.06 → 5842.62] I love,
[5842.84 → 5844.22] what a great job
[5844.22 → 5845.64] they did of motion
[5845.64 → 5846.48] tracking this
[5846.48 → 5848.70] to make it seem
[5848.70 → 5849.68] like I ever
[5849.68 → 5850.42] even managed
[5850.42 → 5851.72] to get to this point.
[5851.72 → 5853.06] love it.
[5854.06 → 5855.10] Or is it your
[5855.10 → 5855.94] old motherboard
[5855.94 → 5857.14] slowing you down?
[5857.50 → 5858.04] Maybe you need
[5858.04 → 5858.40] some help
[5858.40 → 5859.30] from our sponsor,
[5859.74 → 5860.48] MSI.
[5861.34 → 5862.28] Give your old
[5862.28 → 5863.06] motherboard to your
[5863.06 → 5863.98] siblings and upgrade
[5863.98 → 5864.94] to the MSI Meg
[5864.94 → 5866.64] X670E Tomahawk.
[5867.00 → 5867.92] It's ready for AMD
[5867.92 → 5869.08] Ry zen 9000,
[5869.16 → 5869.74] 8000,
[5869.82 → 5871.26] and 7000 series
[5871.26 → 5871.94] processors and
[5871.94 → 5872.86] support superfast
[5872.86 → 5873.96] DDR5 memory up to
[5873.96 → 5875.62] 6,000 plus megatransfers
[5875.62 → 5876.10] per second.
[5876.58 → 5877.60] Just like you,
[5877.88 → 5878.72] a graphics card
[5878.72 → 5879.72] should never bend
[5879.72 → 5880.96] or fall under
[5880.96 → 5881.72] the weight of
[5881.72 → 5882.30] adversity.
[5882.90 → 5883.34] And that's why
[5883.34 → 5884.36] MSI has reinforced
[5884.36 → 5885.48] their PCIe slots
[5885.48 → 5886.12] with additional
[5886.12 → 5886.78] solder points.
[5887.58 → 5888.16] You'll never miss
[5888.16 → 5888.76] an audio cue
[5888.76 → 5889.42] in a boss fight
[5889.42 → 5890.18] thanks to MSI's
[5890.18 → 5890.96] audio boost feature.
[5891.08 → 5891.32] Plus,
[5891.44 → 5892.14] the board is durable
[5892.14 → 5892.68] thanks to its
[5892.68 → 5893.22] high quality
[5893.22 → 5894.28] 8 layer PCB
[5894.28 → 5895.04] made of 2 ounce
[5895.04 → 5895.68] thickened copper
[5895.68 → 5896.52] and server grade
[5896.52 → 5897.00] materials.
[5897.40 → 5897.96] So check out
[5897.96 → 5899.32] the MSI Meg
[5899.32 → 5900.48] X670E Tomahawk
[5900.48 → 5901.38] Wi-Fi motherboard

[5910.62 → 5911.44] away from your

[5914.82 → 5916.46] Okay, cool.

[5974.12 → 5974.48] is brought to you
[5974.48 → 5975.12] by Back blaze.
[5975.36 → 5975.94] Have you ever
[5975.94 → 5976.64] dropped a hard drive
[5976.64 → 5977.22] by accident?
[5978.50 → 5979.32] I have.
[5980.04 → 5981.00] Multiple times.
[5981.50 → 5982.24] That's why we
[5982.24 → 5983.12] backup our data
[5983.12 → 5984.40] nightly here at
[5984.40 → 5985.82] LMG to Back blaze.
[5986.32 → 5987.02] Back blaze is an

[5991.62 → 5992.56] You can back up
[5992.56 → 5993.58] almost anything
[5993.58 → 5994.30] from your Mac or
[5994.30 → 5995.42] PC and access it
[5995.42 → 5996.08] anywhere in the

[5999.32 → 5999.90] business data
[5999.90 → 6000.40] through a

[6006.50 → 6007.18] and they offer
[6007.18 → 6008.16] multiple restore
[6008.16 → 6008.78] options in the

[6019.46 → 6020.16] under their management,
[6020.16 → 6022.08] and you can try it
[6022.08 → 6023.48] out for free with

[6025.96 → 6027.16] backblaze.com
[6027.16 → 6028.42] slash WAN.
[6030.22 → 6031.88] All right, Dan,
[6031.96 → 6032.40] hit us with a
[6032.40 → 6032.76] couple merch
[6032.76 → 6033.14] messages,
[6033.36 → 6033.72] apparently.
[6034.60 → 6035.20] Yeah, apparently,
[6035.66 → 6036.08] sure.
[6036.70 → 6037.78] What's wrong?
[6038.16 → 6038.82] What's with the
[6038.82 → 6039.94] stagnation in
[6039.94 → 6041.18] consumer-wired
[6041.18 → 6041.62] networking?
[6041.84 → 6042.78] We've had 10
[6042.78 → 6043.62] gig for decades,
[6043.76 → 6044.96] but they invent a
[6044.96 → 6046.00] newer, slower,
[6046.20 → 6047.72] N-base T and
[6047.72 → 6048.40] implement that
[6048.40 → 6048.76] instead.
[6048.76 → 6050.06] Also, the
[6050.06 → 6051.16] U7 Pro Max
[6051.16 → 6052.42] bottlenecked by a
[6052.42 → 6053.62] 2.5G uplink.
[6053.86 → 6054.86] It's really hard.
[6055.48 → 6055.94] It's really
[6055.94 → 6056.44] expensive.
[6058.08 → 6059.54] Also, and
[6059.54 → 6060.16] this is going to
[6060.16 → 6061.18] be a real
[6061.18 → 6061.90] bummer for
[6061.90 → 6062.56] people who
[6062.56 → 6063.20] don't feel
[6063.20 → 6063.94] this way and
[6063.94 → 6064.70] don't agree,
[6065.30 → 6066.06] but faster
[6066.06 → 6067.06] than gigabit
[6067.06 → 6069.20] is just not
[6069.20 → 6070.16] necessary for
[6070.16 → 6071.02] almost anyone.
[6072.16 → 6073.80] And trust me,
[6073.92 → 6074.60] if you're one of
[6074.60 → 6075.48] those people who
[6075.48 → 6076.90] needs two and a
[6076.90 → 6077.32] half gig,
[6077.32 → 6078.14] five gig,
[6078.42 → 6079.06] 10 gig,
[6079.56 → 6081.04] I hear you.
[6081.36 → 6082.42] I'm with you.
[6082.76 → 6083.90] I want faster
[6083.90 → 6085.00] networking,
[6085.60 → 6087.28] but the vast
[6087.28 → 6088.42] majority of what
[6088.42 → 6089.70] anybody does is
[6089.70 → 6090.24] not going to be
[6090.24 → 6090.88] bottlenecked by
[6090.88 → 6091.50] gigabit, which
[6091.50 → 6091.98] has been around
[6091.98 → 6092.64] since on
[6092.64 → 6093.06] consumer
[6093.06 → 6093.62] motherboards
[6093.62 → 6095.42] since what?
[6095.42 → 6102.16] early 2000s?
[6102.46 → 6103.48] Late 90s?
[6104.00 → 6104.56] Like, I'm
[6104.56 → 6104.96] pretty sure
[6104.96 → 6105.70] socket A
[6105.70 → 6106.46] motherboards had
[6106.46 → 6106.82] gigabit
[6106.82 → 6107.28] networking.
[6108.12 → 6112.56] So, here,
[6112.66 → 6112.90] hold on.
[6112.96 → 6113.26] Let me see.
[6113.34 → 6113.68] Let me see.
[6113.82 → 6114.42] Okay, here's
[6114.42 → 6116.10] the retro web.
[6116.24 → 6116.76] Here we go.
[6117.48 → 6118.14] This is a
[6118.14 → 6118.70] motherboard that
[6118.70 → 6119.36] was like kind of
[6119.36 → 6120.72] popular back when
[6120.72 → 6122.02] I was getting
[6122.02 → 6122.76] into computers.
[6122.76 → 6124.30] blah, blah, blah.
[6124.44 → 6125.16] No issue.
[6125.76 → 6126.58] Okay, two times
[6126.58 → 6128.26] RJ45 LAN.
[6128.88 → 6129.26] Chips.
[6129.48 → 6130.04] Here we go.
[6130.84 → 6131.12] Yeah.
[6131.48 → 6132.56] Okay, so this was
[6132.56 → 6134.50] PCI gigabit,
[6134.94 → 6136.88] which was kind of
[6136.88 → 6137.76] problematic because
[6137.76 → 6139.84] it used up a lot
[6139.84 → 6140.36] of the available
[6140.36 → 6141.94] PCIe, or PCIe,
[6142.16 → 6142.86] a lot of the
[6142.86 → 6143.88] available PCI bus,
[6143.92 → 6144.54] which was shared,
[6144.94 → 6145.86] if you were
[6145.86 → 6146.74] actually transferring
[6146.74 → 6147.24] at full speed.
[6147.30 → 6147.92] Not that you really
[6147.92 → 6149.48] could to anything
[6149.48 → 6150.44] meaningfully because
[6150.44 → 6151.08] your internet would
[6151.08 → 6151.58] be nowhere near
[6151.58 → 6152.10] that speed.
[6152.60 → 6153.72] And, you know,
[6153.72 → 6154.24] realistically,
[6155.04 → 6155.96] unless you were,
[6156.54 → 6156.98] I mean, yeah,
[6157.02 → 6157.56] I guess transferring
[6157.56 → 6158.16] off of NAS,
[6158.26 → 6159.02] you might get close,
[6159.12 → 6159.70] but there was
[6159.70 → 6160.74] Windows overhead
[6160.74 → 6161.12] and stuff.
[6161.18 → 6161.50] Like, you never
[6161.50 → 6162.46] really saw gigabit
[6162.46 → 6163.22] speeds back in
[6163.22 → 6163.68] those days.
[6164.26 → 6165.18] But also,
[6165.80 → 6166.94] PCI just wasn't
[6166.94 → 6167.72] fast enough that
[6167.72 → 6168.16] you could get
[6168.16 → 6169.28] full, full gigabit
[6169.28 → 6169.52] speed.
[6169.60 → 6170.16] So, this wasn't
[6170.16 → 6171.36] even proper gigabit
[6171.36 → 6172.00] yet, but it was
[6172.00 → 6172.76] already a thing.
[6173.02 → 6173.76] Like, back when
[6173.76 → 6175.32] this board was
[6175.32 → 6176.16] popular, so this
[6176.16 → 6176.58] would have been in,
[6176.68 → 6178.46] like, what, 2003?
[6178.46 → 6179.58] Or something like
[6179.58 → 6179.76] that?
[6179.82 → 6181.40] Like, 2002, 2003
[6181.40 → 6182.34] Enforce 2 era?
[6183.84 → 6187.10] But it's fine.
[6189.74 → 6191.68] And making
[6191.68 → 6193.34] interfaces go fast
[6193.34 → 6194.66] over long distances
[6194.66 → 6197.36] is still really hard.
[6197.70 → 6198.34] I mean, look at
[6198.34 → 6198.74] things like
[6198.74 → 6199.22] Thunderbolt.
[6199.50 → 6200.32] We can go as
[6200.32 → 6201.12] fast as 40
[6201.12 → 6202.16] gigabit per second
[6202.16 → 6205.34] through USB 4,
[6205.50 → 6205.72] right?
[6205.72 → 6208.08] But those
[6208.08 → 6209.56] interfaces are
[6209.56 → 6211.12] limited to...
[6211.12 → 6211.84] Luke, do you
[6211.84 → 6212.52] know of the top
[6212.52 → 6212.88] of your head,
[6212.92 → 6213.50] is it a meter
[6213.50 → 6214.68] or something like
[6214.68 → 6214.90] that?
[6214.96 → 6215.44] Like, what's the
[6215.44 → 6216.36] fastest, what's
[6216.36 → 6217.42] the longest cable
[6217.42 → 6218.24] length you can do
[6218.24 → 6219.16] 40 gigabit over
[6219.16 → 6220.10] for Thunderbolt 4?
[6221.02 → 6221.74] I don't know
[6221.74 → 6222.12] off the top of my
[6222.12 → 6222.24] head.
[6222.30 → 6222.60] I can try to
[6222.60 → 6222.98] look it up.
[6224.14 → 6224.94] No, that's fine.
[6225.10 → 6225.98] I'm on it already.
[6231.30 → 6232.06] Two meters.
[6232.24 → 6232.70] Two meters.
[6232.70 → 6233.22] Two meters!
[6233.22 → 6235.20] Six point five feet.
[6235.98 → 6236.80] Yeah, an Ethernet
[6236.80 → 6238.64] standard that can't
[6238.64 → 6240.48] handle 100 meters is
[6240.48 → 6242.40] not a useful Ethernet
[6242.40 → 6242.82] standard.
[6243.40 → 6244.92] And so, the complexity
[6244.92 → 6246.68] that you're adding in
[6246.68 → 6248.48] signalling on both ends
[6248.48 → 6250.44] in order to transmit
[6250.44 → 6252.44] and receive at much
[6252.44 → 6253.78] higher data rates over
[6253.78 → 6254.82] much greater distances,
[6255.44 → 6256.22] you've got to have a...
[6256.22 → 6258.34] Man, you've got to have
[6258.34 → 6259.56] a perfect reason to
[6259.56 → 6260.44] make that kind of
[6260.44 → 6262.92] investment in both R&D
[6262.92 → 6263.88] developing these chips
[6263.88 → 6266.32] and in just the cost
[6266.32 → 6267.74] of putting these chipsets
[6267.74 → 6268.62] into your devices.
[6269.00 → 6269.88] I would make the
[6269.88 → 6271.10] argument that even
[6271.10 → 6271.90] two and a half gig,
[6271.98 → 6273.04] the vast majority of
[6273.04 → 6273.70] devices that are
[6273.70 → 6274.40] shipping with a two
[6274.40 → 6274.98] and a half gig
[6274.98 → 6275.80] interface on them
[6275.80 → 6277.52] are not taking
[6277.52 → 6278.30] advantage of it
[6278.30 → 6279.82] almost ever the way
[6279.82 → 6280.66] that most people are
[6280.66 → 6281.12] using them.
[6281.54 → 6282.64] Like, I'm thrilled
[6282.64 → 6284.02] that consumer
[6284.02 → 6284.68] motherboards have
[6284.68 → 6285.30] two and a half gig
[6285.30 → 6286.12] LAN on them now
[6286.12 → 6287.64] because I happen to
[6287.64 → 6288.38] have a two and a half
[6288.38 → 6289.36] gig internet connection,
[6289.36 → 6290.48] and even then,
[6290.54 → 6291.06] the only time it
[6291.06 → 6291.74] really comes up
[6291.74 → 6292.10] is when I'm
[6292.10 → 6292.86] downloading games,
[6293.02 → 6294.28] and even then,
[6294.40 → 6295.18] the only reason it
[6295.18 → 6296.12] matters for me is
[6296.12 → 6296.90] because my computer
[6296.90 → 6297.74] is fast enough
[6297.74 → 6298.72] that I can actually
[6298.72 → 6299.94] unpack those games
[6299.94 → 6302.64] at 250 megabytes
[6302.64 → 6303.34] a second because
[6303.34 → 6304.32] if I didn't have a
[6304.32 → 6305.12] fast enough processor,
[6305.38 → 6306.14] I wouldn't even be
[6306.14 → 6306.90] able to take advantage
[6306.90 → 6307.58] of that connection
[6307.58 → 6308.42] on a single system.
[6311.10 → 6312.40] So why not?
[6313.60 → 6314.42] More like,
[6315.50 → 6316.64] why?
[6316.78 → 6317.02] We just,
[6317.14 → 6317.64] we haven't been
[6317.64 → 6318.28] incentivized,
[6318.32 → 6319.00] and it's really,
[6319.28 → 6319.52] really,
[6319.74 → 6320.38] really hard
[6320.38 → 6321.62] over great distances.
[6322.48 → 6322.72] There.
[6323.20 → 6323.70] Luke, did you have
[6323.70 → 6324.36] anything to add to
[6324.36 → 6324.50] that?
[6324.54 → 6325.04] Did I miss anything?
[6326.00 → 6326.86] No, I don't think so.
[6328.40 → 6328.74] Yeah.
[6329.86 → 6330.80] Hey, Linus,
[6330.92 → 6332.16] I saw you mentioned
[6332.16 → 6333.46] Power Rangers in a vid
[6333.46 → 6334.00] recently.
[6334.28 → 6335.02] Which one of them
[6335.02 → 6335.56] was your favourite?
[6336.94 → 6337.78] Oh, which power?
[6337.86 → 6338.36] Well, it's got to be
[6338.36 → 6340.18] Tommy, right?
[6340.60 → 6341.56] You don't do it by colour?
[6341.56 → 6343.80] Well, I mean,
[6344.34 → 6345.70] well, Tommy was
[6345.70 → 6346.54] multiple colours,
[6346.62 → 6346.84] though.
[6347.48 → 6347.80] Oh.
[6348.42 → 6349.90] But I liked him
[6349.90 → 6351.10] because he was like,
[6352.00 → 6352.30] you know,
[6352.40 → 6353.68] the evil ranger,
[6353.94 → 6354.96] the green ranger.
[6356.56 → 6357.62] And green was just
[6357.62 → 6358.70] like my favourite colour.
[6358.90 → 6359.56] And also,
[6359.70 → 6360.44] like, he was cool.
[6361.10 → 6363.38] And then he was
[6363.38 → 6364.48] the white ranger later.
[6364.70 → 6367.20] But then I didn't
[6367.20 → 6368.56] really care anymore
[6368.56 → 6369.20] about Power Rangers
[6369.20 → 6369.80] by that point.
[6369.80 → 6371.40] So, sure,
[6371.54 → 6372.10] green ranger.
[6372.54 → 6373.34] Yeah, let's go
[6373.34 → 6373.92] with green ranger.
[6374.60 → 6375.10] I mean, the last
[6375.10 → 6375.78] thing you want to do
[6375.78 → 6376.36] is, like,
[6376.98 → 6378.10] stand the white
[6378.10 → 6378.86] power ranger.
[6381.38 → 6383.32] Yeah, that's, uh...
[6383.32 → 6383.92] A little awkward.
[6384.56 → 6385.00] Yep.
[6385.32 → 6386.02] Wish they'd thought
[6386.02 → 6387.10] of that back then.
[6387.80 → 6388.46] Really, yeah,
[6388.54 → 6388.96] really do.
[6389.60 → 6390.04] Oops.
[6391.26 → 6391.84] All right,
[6391.88 → 6392.50] last one I got
[6392.50 → 6392.96] for you here.
[6393.30 → 6394.72] Why is it not okay
[6394.72 → 6395.74] for me to spend
[6395.74 → 6396.44] eight dollars
[6396.44 → 6397.16] to look like
[6397.16 → 6397.90] Jack Sparrow
[6397.90 → 6398.44] in Fortnite,
[6398.86 → 6399.76] but find
[6399.76 → 6400.68] for my SO
[6400.68 → 6401.72] to spend fifty dollars
[6401.72 → 6402.66] to get her nails done,
[6402.76 → 6403.72] or for people
[6403.72 → 6404.64] to dye their hair.
[6404.76 → 6405.42] It's all just
[6405.42 → 6405.98] cosmetics.
[6406.86 → 6407.10] Well,
[6407.48 → 6408.38] for one thing,
[6408.84 → 6409.24] um,
[6410.24 → 6411.26] I would ask
[6411.26 → 6412.18] both of you guys
[6412.18 → 6412.66] who you're trying
[6412.66 → 6413.20] to impress.
[6415.30 → 6415.66] Like,
[6416.08 → 6417.18] it might not be okay
[6417.18 → 6417.72] for your SO
[6417.72 → 6418.56] to spend fifty bucks
[6418.56 → 6419.30] to get her nails done.
[6419.42 → 6419.90] Who's she trying
[6419.90 → 6420.24] to attract?
[6420.34 → 6421.56] No, I'm kidding.
[6421.64 → 6421.92] I'm kidding.
[6422.02 → 6422.46] I'm sure you guys
[6422.46 → 6422.88] are doing great.
[6423.30 → 6424.08] Somebody that plays
[6424.08 → 6424.76] a better video game?
[6424.76 → 6425.06] Look,
[6425.06 → 6426.64] I don't think
[6426.64 → 6427.46] either Luke
[6427.46 → 6428.24] or I have ever
[6428.24 → 6429.94] said don't support,
[6429.94 → 6431.06] um,
[6431.24 → 6432.32] content that you love.
[6433.68 → 6435.26] What we don't like
[6435.26 → 6437.08] is the predatory
[6437.08 → 6438.40] practices
[6438.40 → 6440.44] that companies
[6440.44 → 6441.68] like Epic Games
[6441.68 → 6442.84] are engaging in.
[6443.50 → 6444.06] Um,
[6444.52 → 6446.22] personally,
[6446.48 → 6447.98] I'm really not
[6447.98 → 6448.92] that into spending
[6448.92 → 6450.26] money on either
[6450.26 → 6451.12] of those things.
[6451.12 → 6452.46] I,
[6452.72 → 6453.30] you know,
[6453.64 → 6455.74] I think you're,
[6455.84 → 6456.36] I think you're
[6456.36 → 6457.56] probably right
[6457.56 → 6458.94] that I wouldn't
[6458.94 → 6459.68] judge someone
[6459.68 → 6460.38] for having their
[6460.38 → 6461.04] nails painted
[6461.04 → 6462.88] as much as
[6462.88 → 6463.56] I would
[6463.56 → 6464.32] sort of
[6464.32 → 6464.90] disapprove,
[6464.94 → 6465.80] or if it was my kids,
[6466.06 → 6467.00] I wouldn't
[6467.00 → 6468.10] disapprove as much
[6468.10 → 6468.98] of them buying
[6468.98 → 6469.74] an eight dollar,
[6470.08 → 6470.62] um,
[6470.68 → 6471.74] bottle of nail polish,
[6472.32 → 6472.78] uh,
[6473.26 → 6474.20] compared to
[6474.20 → 6475.10] an eight dollar
[6475.10 → 6475.94] skin in Fortnite.
[6476.80 → 6477.20] Um,
[6478.12 → 6478.86] honestly speaking,
[6478.86 → 6479.48] it's not something
[6479.48 → 6480.12] that I've thought
[6480.12 → 6480.78] about much.
[6481.12 → 6483.10] And it's a really
[6483.10 → 6483.74] good question.
[6484.04 → 6485.20] What is the difference?
[6486.68 → 6487.48] I would say
[6487.48 → 6488.42] that one difference
[6488.42 → 6489.00] for me,
[6489.44 → 6491.14] especially if you
[6491.14 → 6492.72] are
[6492.72 → 6494.38] doing it yourself,
[6494.82 → 6495.38] like if you're
[6495.38 → 6496.12] painting your own
[6496.12 → 6496.44] nails,
[6496.64 → 6496.92] um,
[6497.00 → 6497.24] you know,
[6497.28 → 6497.84] putting on your
[6497.84 → 6498.52] own little stickers,
[6498.74 → 6499.22] putting on your
[6499.22 → 6499.90] own clear coats
[6499.90 → 6500.26] or whatever,
[6500.36 → 6500.96] I would say that
[6500.96 → 6502.30] that's an activity.
[6502.46 → 6503.30] I'd say that's a hobby.
[6503.50 → 6503.76] However,
[6503.80 → 6504.34] you could make a
[6504.34 → 6504.94] similar argument
[6504.94 → 6505.62] for Fortnite.
[6505.72 → 6506.38] If playing Fortnite
[6506.38 → 6506.90] is your,
[6506.98 → 6507.64] is your activity,
[6507.64 → 6508.22] if it's,
[6508.32 → 6509.28] if it's your hobby,
[6509.38 → 6510.00] if that's your form
[6510.00 → 6510.84] of self-expression,
[6510.84 → 6511.96] then I think
[6511.96 → 6512.82] you could make
[6512.82 → 6513.58] an argument there.
[6514.20 → 6514.64] Um,
[6514.86 → 6517.50] I wouldn't do
[6517.50 → 6517.84] either.
[6519.30 → 6519.78] I,
[6519.90 → 6520.62] I definitely
[6520.62 → 6522.50] have dyed my hair
[6522.50 → 6523.50] at points in my
[6523.50 → 6523.80] life.
[6523.80 → 6525.62] I was a lot younger.
[6527.20 → 6527.60] Um,
[6527.74 → 6528.74] and you know
[6528.74 → 6529.90] why I did it
[6529.90 → 6531.04] was the last
[6531.04 → 6531.78] time I dyed my
[6531.78 → 6532.60] hair before
[6532.60 → 6533.34] the brand
[6533.34 → 6533.94] sponsorship
[6533.94 → 6535.04] for the
[6535.04 → 6535.40] the
[6535.40 → 6535.96] the bleach
[6535.96 → 6536.54] this time,
[6536.54 → 6537.38] which by the way,
[6537.38 → 6538.00] didn't cost me
[6538.00 → 6538.34] anything.
[6538.34 → 6539.16] I actually made
[6539.16 → 6539.76] money on it.
[6540.32 → 6540.76] So,
[6540.76 → 6541.60] yeah,
[6541.86 → 6542.48] more that,
[6542.86 → 6543.08] yeah,
[6543.16 → 6543.46] that's,
[6543.58 → 6543.82] that was,
[6543.86 → 6544.12] that this,
[6544.20 → 6544.80] this was not,
[6544.90 → 6545.96] this was not me
[6545.96 → 6546.84] painting my nails
[6546.84 → 6547.40] or buying a
[6547.40 → 6547.96] Fortnite skin.
[6548.24 → 6548.68] Uh,
[6548.68 → 6549.44] the last time I
[6549.44 → 6549.84] did it
[6549.84 → 6551.46] was when I
[6551.46 → 6552.52] had started
[6552.52 → 6553.30] dating Yvonne,
[6553.38 → 6554.08] but hadn't met
[6554.08 → 6554.88] her parents yet.
[6555.18 → 6556.56] And for loss,
[6556.60 → 6558.02] I dyed my hair
[6558.02 → 6558.84] bleach blonde
[6558.84 → 6560.42] right before she
[6560.42 → 6561.06] introduced me to
[6561.06 → 6561.64] her parents
[6561.64 → 6562.64] to troll Yvonne.
[6562.64 → 6564.16] that was the
[6564.16 → 6565.40] last time that
[6565.40 → 6566.62] I,
[6566.82 → 6568.46] what a jerk.
[6572.42 → 6573.36] Can you believe
[6573.36 → 6575.10] she married me?
[6576.02 → 6576.50] Sometimes,
[6576.86 → 6577.50] I don't know.
[6578.66 → 6578.86] Oh,
[6578.86 → 6579.28] um,
[6580.56 → 6582.72] Katie talks
[6582.72 → 6583.18] says Linus
[6583.18 → 6583.82] spent money on a
[6583.82 → 6584.38] facial treatment,
[6584.56 → 6585.00] so he'll spend
[6585.00 → 6585.88] money on cosmetics.
[6586.20 → 6586.64] Actually,
[6586.78 → 6587.58] that is totally,
[6587.68 → 6588.38] that is totally
[6588.38 → 6588.78] true.
[6589.38 → 6589.82] Um,
[6590.36 → 6591.04] again though,
[6591.18 → 6591.40] you know,
[6591.46 → 6592.46] I do consider
[6592.46 → 6593.06] Luke and I
[6593.06 → 6593.60] talked about this
[6593.60 → 6594.02] on the show.
[6594.12 → 6594.88] I do consider
[6594.88 → 6596.02] maintaining my
[6596.02 → 6596.90] appearance to be
[6596.90 → 6597.80] an investment in
[6597.80 → 6599.16] my career at
[6599.16 → 6599.58] this point.
[6599.68 → 6599.96] Like,
[6600.50 → 6600.88] um,
[6600.90 → 6601.80] not looking like
[6601.80 → 6602.64] my body's falling
[6602.64 → 6603.82] apart is,
[6603.82 → 6605.30] is an advantage
[6605.30 → 6606.60] when you are an
[6606.60 → 6607.72] on-camera personality.
[6607.94 → 6608.66] We can,
[6608.80 → 6609.80] we can not like
[6609.80 → 6610.12] that,
[6610.48 → 6610.72] you know,
[6610.76 → 6611.28] we can think
[6611.28 → 6611.80] that's stupid
[6611.80 → 6612.44] or whatever,
[6612.44 → 6614.16] but there is
[6614.16 → 6615.62] no arguing with
[6615.62 → 6615.80] it.
[6615.80 → 6616.02] Like,
[6616.04 → 6616.32] if you,
[6616.40 → 6616.88] if you want to
[6616.88 → 6617.68] argue that,
[6617.78 → 6618.24] um,
[6618.30 → 6618.52] you know,
[6618.54 → 6619.28] not looking
[6619.28 → 6620.44] presentable,
[6620.56 → 6621.14] uh,
[6621.14 → 6621.80] doesn't matter.
[6621.80 → 6622.44] Um,
[6622.92 → 6623.84] for an on-camera,
[6623.88 → 6624.38] as a media
[6624.38 → 6624.98] personality,
[6625.12 → 6625.88] you're just wrong.
[6625.98 → 6626.22] Like,
[6626.24 → 6626.98] you're just actually
[6626.98 → 6627.26] wrong.
[6627.50 → 6627.82] Um,
[6627.98 → 6628.82] it's not how it
[6628.82 → 6629.06] works.
[6632.38 → 6633.44] No bro talks.
[6633.84 → 6634.22] Um,
[6634.72 → 6635.04] uh,
[6635.04 → 6635.52] I forget what
[6635.52 → 6635.84] it's called.
[6635.92 → 6636.40] Morpheus 8.
[6636.52 → 6637.10] It's like a
[6637.10 → 6637.90] it's like a micro,
[6638.08 → 6638.84] micro needling,
[6638.96 → 6639.64] micro puncturing
[6639.64 → 6640.10] treatment.
[6640.44 → 6640.84] Uh,
[6640.84 → 6641.62] that's it so far.
[6642.28 → 6642.84] Elijah's like,
[6642.88 → 6642.98] yeah,
[6642.98 → 6643.70] that's why I got
[6643.70 → 6644.64] the butt lift.
[6645.84 → 6646.22] Oof.
[6646.74 → 6647.14] Um,
[6647.44 → 6647.84] anyway.
[6647.84 → 6648.72] I think a lot
[6648.72 → 6649.28] of it's like
[6649.28 → 6650.48] people's habits
[6650.48 → 6651.58] and stuff too.
[6651.76 → 6651.96] Like,
[6652.26 → 6652.72] um,
[6653.84 → 6657.46] Linus mentioned
[6657.46 → 6658.12] the whole predatory
[6658.12 → 6658.90] nature of it.
[6659.10 → 6659.44] It,
[6659.44 → 6660.38] it can hit
[6660.38 → 6661.14] people really
[6661.14 → 6661.48] hard.
[6661.88 → 6662.28] Uh,
[6662.56 → 6663.40] like gambling
[6663.40 → 6663.72] is,
[6663.78 → 6664.24] is one of the
[6664.24 → 6664.56] things that I
[6664.56 → 6664.84] look at.
[6664.96 → 6665.50] Gambling has
[6665.50 → 6666.24] ruined countless
[6666.24 → 6666.72] lives.
[6666.84 → 6667.74] At the same
[6667.74 → 6668.26] time,
[6668.26 → 6669.44] I know of
[6669.44 → 6671.06] one person
[6671.06 → 6672.52] who has a
[6672.52 → 6673.74] very healthy
[6673.74 → 6674.62] relationship with
[6674.62 → 6674.94] gambling.
[6674.94 → 6675.94] They know
[6675.94 → 6676.26] that they
[6676.26 → 6676.74] really like
[6676.74 → 6677.06] gambling.
[6677.28 → 6677.94] They find
[6677.94 → 6678.44] it very
[6678.44 → 6679.02] entertaining
[6679.02 → 6680.04] and they
[6680.04 → 6680.50] will take
[6680.50 → 6681.06] the money
[6681.06 → 6681.60] that it
[6681.60 → 6682.28] would cost
[6682.28 → 6682.88] to take
[6682.88 → 6683.32] themselves
[6683.32 → 6683.68] and their
[6683.68 → 6684.22] partner out
[6684.22 → 6684.90] to a movie
[6684.90 → 6686.68] and like
[6686.68 → 6687.34] get dinner
[6687.34 → 6688.22] and they'll,
[6688.44 → 6689.28] they'll leave
[6689.28 → 6690.24] all the rest
[6690.24 → 6690.80] of their methods
[6690.80 → 6691.18] of getting
[6691.18 → 6691.90] money at home
[6691.90 → 6693.22] and they'll
[6693.22 → 6693.72] take that
[6693.72 → 6694.10] money to
[6694.10 → 6694.56] the casino
[6694.56 → 6695.64] and they
[6695.64 → 6696.20] get dinner
[6696.20 → 6696.74] at the casino
[6696.74 → 6697.80] and they
[6697.80 → 6698.18] gamble
[6698.18 → 6699.02] and when
[6699.02 → 6699.40] they're out
[6699.40 → 6699.84] of money
[6699.84 → 6700.92] or when
[6700.92 → 6701.28] they feel
[6701.28 → 6701.66] like going
[6701.66 → 6701.98] home,
[6702.08 → 6702.62] they go
[6702.62 → 6702.84] home.
[6703.72 → 6704.06] And that's
[6704.06 → 6704.26] like,
[6704.38 → 6704.58] well,
[6704.58 → 6705.18] all right,
[6705.42 → 6705.72] if you
[6705.72 → 6706.20] find that
[6706.20 → 6706.62] just as
[6706.62 → 6707.04] entertaining
[6707.04 → 6707.70] as going
[6707.70 → 6708.00] to go
[6708.00 → 6708.38] watch a
[6708.38 → 6708.76] movie or
[6708.76 → 6709.30] more so
[6709.30 → 6710.06] and you're
[6710.06 → 6710.60] spending the
[6710.60 → 6710.94] same amount
[6710.94 → 6711.24] of money,
[6711.30 → 6711.84] that seems
[6711.84 → 6712.10] like a
[6712.10 → 6712.44] relatively
[6712.44 → 6712.76] healthy
[6712.76 → 6713.20] relationship
[6713.20 → 6713.70] with it.
[6713.98 → 6715.10] But in
[6715.10 → 6715.74] saying that
[6715.74 → 6716.54] the vast
[6716.54 → 6717.18] majority of
[6717.18 → 6718.02] people don't
[6718.02 → 6718.60] treat gambling
[6718.60 → 6719.10] that way
[6719.10 → 6719.56] when they
[6719.56 → 6719.88] gamble.
[6720.32 → 6720.66] So like
[6720.66 → 6721.00] it's,
[6721.06 → 6721.70] it's not
[6721.70 → 6723.48] gambling can
[6723.48 → 6724.22] still be bad.
[6724.44 → 6724.68] But here's
[6724.68 → 6724.92] the thing,
[6725.00 → 6725.56] coming back
[6725.56 → 6726.42] to Hugo's
[6726.42 → 6727.18] question here,
[6727.32 → 6727.94] like what's
[6727.94 → 6728.32] the difference?
[6728.40 → 6728.96] The cosmetic
[6728.96 → 6729.50] is the
[6729.50 → 6729.94] cosmetics
[6729.94 → 6730.38] industry
[6730.38 → 6731.06] has probably
[6731.06 → 6731.74] done more
[6731.74 → 6732.42] damage to
[6732.42 → 6732.94] people's
[6732.94 → 6733.68] mental health
[6733.68 → 6734.56] than
[6734.56 → 6735.50] Fortnite
[6735.50 → 6736.04] skins,
[6736.40 → 6736.84] honestly.
[6738.60 → 6739.46] And not
[6739.46 → 6740.46] just mental
[6740.46 → 6740.78] health.
[6740.88 → 6741.00] I mean,
[6741.04 → 6741.54] we want to
[6741.54 → 6742.22] talk about
[6742.22 → 6743.26] testing on
[6743.26 → 6743.94] animals or
[6743.94 → 6744.60] any other
[6744.60 → 6746.30] harm that
[6746.30 → 6746.88] the cosmetics
[6746.88 → 6747.94] industry has
[6747.94 → 6748.68] created or
[6748.68 → 6749.36] perpetuated.
[6749.36 → 6750.22] it's,
[6750.22 → 6751.22] it's not an
[6751.22 → 6751.86] industry that
[6751.86 → 6752.36] I'm looking
[6752.36 → 6752.76] at going
[6752.76 → 6753.00] like,
[6753.08 → 6753.38] oh yeah,
[6753.48 → 6753.82] well that's
[6753.82 → 6754.06] like a
[6754.06 → 6754.40] perfectly
[6754.40 → 6754.84] reasonable
[6754.84 → 6755.48] thing to
[6755.48 → 6756.02] support.
[6758.84 → 6759.40] I don't
[6759.40 → 6759.52] know,
[6759.58 → 6759.94] maybe it's
[6759.94 → 6760.14] just,
[6760.28 → 6760.78] maybe it's
[6760.78 → 6761.28] that
[6761.28 → 6761.86] was already
[6761.86 → 6762.66] normalized when
[6762.66 → 6763.00] I was in
[6763.00 → 6763.44] my formative
[6763.44 → 6763.80] years.
[6764.94 → 6765.38] Personally,
[6765.96 → 6766.74] man,
[6766.84 → 6767.08] I hate,
[6767.16 → 6767.46] I hate to
[6767.46 → 6767.74] get into
[6767.74 → 6768.14] this kind
[6768.14 → 6768.46] of thing
[6768.46 → 6769.26] because I'm
[6769.26 → 6769.42] not,
[6769.46 → 6769.70] I'm not
[6769.70 → 6770.36] judging or
[6770.36 → 6770.64] anything,
[6770.64 → 6771.78] but personally
[6771.78 → 6773.30] I find
[6773.30 → 6774.98] super
[6774.98 → 6777.22] done up
[6777.22 → 6777.74] nails
[6777.74 → 6780.14] unattractive.
[6780.14 → 6781.04] I'm not
[6781.04 → 6781.70] neutral on
[6781.70 → 6781.86] it.
[6782.38 → 6783.26] I find it
[6783.26 → 6784.94] unattractive.
[6785.44 → 6786.12] To me,
[6786.92 → 6787.40] it looks
[6787.40 → 6787.92] like,
[6788.52 → 6789.50] it looks
[6789.50 → 6790.26] like
[6790.26 → 6793.24] not just
[6793.24 → 6794.40] not wanting
[6794.40 → 6795.40] to like
[6795.40 → 6795.90] work with
[6795.90 → 6796.50] your hands
[6796.50 → 6797.66] if it came
[6797.66 → 6798.02] to that,
[6798.10 → 6798.50] it looks
[6798.50 → 6800.30] like actively
[6800.30 → 6801.04] avoiding
[6801.04 → 6802.20] successfully
[6802.20 → 6803.50] avoiding
[6803.50 → 6804.50] doing
[6804.50 → 6804.92] anything
[6804.92 → 6805.76] that would
[6805.76 → 6806.56] break a
[6806.56 → 6807.38] nail or
[6807.38 → 6809.66] damage a
[6809.66 → 6810.20] glue on
[6810.20 → 6811.06] or damage
[6811.06 → 6811.62] the finish
[6811.62 → 6812.08] of the
[6812.08 → 6812.46] ends of
[6812.46 → 6812.98] your fingers.
[6813.50 → 6814.24] It's not
[6814.24 → 6814.74] a trait
[6814.74 → 6815.58] that I
[6815.58 → 6816.02] find
[6816.02 → 6816.94] attractive
[6816.94 → 6818.16] personally.
[6823.26 → 6823.78] So,
[6824.78 → 6826.70] cool?
[6828.04 → 6828.68] I don't
[6828.68 → 6828.86] know if
[6828.86 → 6829.14] that really
[6829.14 → 6829.40] means
[6829.40 → 6829.76] anything.
[6830.44 → 6830.64] Well,
[6830.64 → 6831.20] what it
[6831.20 → 6831.44] means,
[6831.56 → 6831.68] well,
[6831.70 → 6831.94] they were
[6831.94 → 6832.24] asking,
[6832.44 → 6833.04] why do
[6833.04 → 6833.26] you have
[6833.26 → 6833.60] this double
[6833.60 → 6833.94] standard,
[6834.08 → 6834.30] Linus?
[6834.36 → 6834.62] Why do
[6834.62 → 6834.92] you think
[6834.92 → 6836.74] it's not
[6836.74 → 6837.22] cool to
[6837.22 → 6837.60] spend $8
[6837.60 → 6838.42] to be
[6838.42 → 6838.82] Jack Sparrow
[6838.82 → 6839.22] on Fortnite,
[6839.70 → 6840.42] but it is
[6840.42 → 6841.98] fine for my
[6841.98 → 6842.48] SO to spend
[6842.48 → 6843.26] $50 for
[6843.26 → 6843.58] your nails.
[6844.00 → 6844.72] I am not
[6844.72 → 6845.20] into your
[6845.20 → 6845.74] SO spending
[6845.74 → 6846.38] $50 on
[6846.38 → 6846.56] nails.
[6846.68 → 6846.86] I think
[6846.86 → 6847.26] it's stupid.
[6848.12 → 6848.24] So,
[6848.48 → 6848.82] there you go.
[6848.82 → 6849.16] But I think
[6849.16 → 6849.64] there's very
[6849.64 → 6850.14] tangible,
[6850.64 → 6850.96] social,
[6851.28 → 6852.04] and professional
[6852.04 → 6852.96] ramifications
[6852.96 → 6854.34] for not
[6854.34 → 6855.04] keeping up a
[6855.04 → 6855.60] certain level
[6855.60 → 6856.16] of appearance,
[6856.56 → 6857.40] which you have
[6857.40 → 6857.92] already pointed
[6857.92 → 6858.20] out,
[6858.64 → 6859.46] and I
[6859.46 → 6859.84] don't really
[6859.84 → 6860.28] think that
[6860.28 → 6861.00] exists with
[6861.00 → 6861.74] gaming skins.
[6861.94 → 6862.40] I think it's
[6862.40 → 6863.32] a different
[6863.32 → 6863.58] thing.
[6865.74 → 6866.42] I think if
[6866.42 → 6866.88] you show up
[6866.88 → 6867.62] looking dishevelled
[6867.62 → 6868.16] all the time,
[6868.88 → 6870.78] people don't take
[6870.78 → 6871.36] you as seriously.
[6872.02 → 6872.24] Yeah,
[6872.48 → 6872.76] yeah,
[6872.76 → 6873.10] that's fair.
[6873.10 → 6873.36] But if you show up
[6873.36 → 6874.24] without gaming skins,
[6874.38 → 6875.34] I don't think anyone
[6875.34 → 6875.62] cares.
[6877.16 → 6877.84] Or rather,
[6877.94 → 6878.12] I mean,
[6878.18 → 6878.68] back to my
[6878.68 → 6879.60] original question
[6879.60 → 6879.82] is,
[6879.90 → 6880.26] who are you
[6880.26 → 6880.96] trying to impress?
[6881.56 → 6882.32] Maybe someone
[6882.32 → 6883.22] cares about you
[6883.22 → 6883.86] not having the
[6883.86 → 6884.72] the coolest gaming skin,
[6884.82 → 6885.14] but you know
[6885.14 → 6885.38] what?
[6885.58 → 6886.30] F*** them.
[6886.70 → 6887.26] Why are you
[6887.26 → 6887.54] trying to
[6887.54 → 6888.08] impress them?
[6888.26 → 6888.36] Yeah.
[6888.58 → 6888.78] Yeah.
[6891.58 → 6892.50] 016Live says
[6892.50 → 6893.10] Linus is
[6893.10 → 6894.02] kinda judgy.
[6895.68 → 6896.10] Look,
[6896.18 → 6896.70] I was talking
[6896.70 → 6897.12] about what
[6897.12 → 6898.38] personally I
[6898.38 → 6899.10] find attractive.
[6899.44 → 6899.84] Personally,
[6900.40 → 6902.48] I knew
[6902.48 → 6903.58] that Yvonne and
[6903.58 → 6904.06] I were headed
[6904.06 → 6904.78] for a long-term
[6904.78 → 6905.36] relationship
[6905.36 → 6906.68] when she was
[6906.68 → 6907.52] over at my
[6907.52 → 6908.22] parents' place
[6908.22 → 6908.66] when we were
[6908.66 → 6909.04] quite a bit
[6909.04 → 6909.34] younger,
[6909.34 → 6910.28] and my
[6910.28 → 6910.86] parents asked
[6910.86 → 6911.34] for help
[6911.34 → 6911.88] mucking out
[6911.88 → 6912.24] the horse
[6912.24 → 6912.60] stalls,
[6913.02 → 6913.60] and Yvonne
[6913.60 → 6914.18] offered to
[6914.18 → 6916.22] help and
[6916.22 → 6917.14] shovelled horse
[6917.14 → 6918.04] manure with me
[6918.04 → 6919.06] so that I
[6919.06 → 6919.52] could be done
[6919.52 → 6920.52] faster so we
[6920.52 → 6920.84] could spend
[6920.84 → 6921.18] more time
[6921.18 → 6921.58] together.
[6922.46 → 6923.34] If she had
[6923.34 → 6923.74] said,
[6924.20 → 6924.80] okay,
[6925.02 → 6926.06] I'll see you
[6926.06 → 6926.64] in a bit,
[6926.92 → 6927.70] I can't do
[6927.70 → 6928.28] that because
[6928.28 → 6929.26] I might damage
[6929.26 → 6929.92] the finish
[6929.92 → 6931.18] on my paint
[6931.18 → 6931.92] on my fingers,
[6932.22 → 6932.98] I'd have been
[6932.98 → 6933.30] like,
[6934.06 → 6934.40] cool.
[6935.88 → 6936.74] Because to
[6936.74 → 6937.16] me,
[6937.76 → 6938.48] you know,
[6938.56 → 6939.02] that's,
[6939.34 → 6940.24] I'm just
[6940.24 → 6940.64] not into
[6940.64 → 6940.90] it.
[6941.28 → 6941.70] I'm not
[6941.70 → 6942.00] into it.
[6942.02 → 6942.34] I'm sorry.
[6943.22 → 6944.42] And that
[6944.42 → 6944.86] works for
[6944.86 → 6945.36] some people.
[6945.66 → 6946.20] And you
[6946.20 → 6946.58] can be,
[6946.66 → 6946.96] and that's
[6946.96 → 6947.58] totally fine.
[6947.66 → 6947.86] Yeah,
[6947.90 → 6948.18] and that's
[6948.18 → 6948.88] totally cool.
[6950.36 → 6951.26] But I'm just
[6951.26 → 6951.60] not into
[6951.60 → 6951.86] that.
[6952.40 → 6952.88] That's all.
[6957.00 → 6957.36] Yeah,
[6957.62 → 6957.96] hit me.
[6959.24 → 6959.40] Oh,
[6959.50 → 6959.84] topics,
[6959.94 → 6960.12] right.
[6960.60 → 6960.94] Oh,
[6960.98 → 6961.22] I got
[6961.22 → 6961.70] signed out.
[6961.94 → 6962.18] Perfect.
[6962.48 → 6962.86] Good timing.
[6964.04 → 6964.28] Luke,
[6964.36 → 6964.56] are you
[6964.56 → 6964.76] got any
[6964.76 → 6964.98] topics?
[6965.10 → 6965.24] Yeah,
[6965.24 → 6965.38] Luke,
[6965.42 → 6965.64] are you
[6965.64 → 6966.04] fidgeting
[6966.04 → 6966.52] with something?
[6966.72 → 6966.86] Yeah,
[6966.86 → 6967.18] stop it.
[6967.28 → 6967.62] I was.
[6967.74 → 6968.06] I'm sorry,
[6968.12 → 6968.50] I stopped.
[6969.34 → 6970.02] Linus still
[6970.02 → 6970.62] has his phone
[6970.62 → 6970.90] on,
[6970.96 → 6971.56] Luke is fidgeting.
[6971.56 → 6972.60] My phone's been
[6972.60 → 6973.30] muted forever.
[6974.12 → 6974.92] It was muted
[6974.92 → 6975.30] already.
[6975.66 → 6976.54] I was switching
[6976.54 → 6977.36] between the free
[6977.36 → 6978.18] spin and the
[6978.18 → 6979.18] not free spin.
[6979.48 → 6979.96] Oh my God.
[6979.96 → 6980.12] Sorry.
[6980.62 → 6981.36] Shake your leg
[6981.36 → 6981.96] like a normal
[6981.96 → 6982.40] person.
[6983.48 → 6984.16] He's probably
[6984.16 → 6984.92] doing that too.
[6985.48 → 6985.98] Oh yeah.
[6986.12 → 6986.66] Are you sure
[6986.66 → 6987.32] you don't have
[6987.32 → 6988.26] ADHD as well?
[6988.96 → 6989.50] There's no way
[6989.50 → 6989.88] he doesn't.
[6990.06 → 6990.08] I'm actually pretty
[6990.08 → 6990.54] sure that I do
[6990.54 → 6991.08] and I'm just
[6991.08 → 6991.34] fine with it.
[6991.34 → 6991.86] There's no way
[6991.86 → 6992.28] he doesn't.
[6992.62 → 6992.88] Have you
[6992.88 → 6993.72] considered meth?
[6993.72 → 6995.08] Did you just
[6995.08 → 6995.60] say meds
[6995.60 → 6996.02] or meth?
[6996.24 → 6996.46] Meth.
[6999.98 → 7000.50] You're going to
[7000.50 → 7001.50] get us demonetized
[7001.50 → 7001.96] with that.
[7003.92 → 7004.40] Sorry.
[7005.18 → 7005.78] You're not
[7005.78 → 7006.34] sorry.
[7006.74 → 7007.32] If you were
[7007.32 → 7007.62] sorry,
[7007.70 → 7008.00] you wouldn't
[7008.00 → 7008.44] have done it.
[7009.34 → 7010.12] That's one of my
[7010.12 → 7011.02] favourite Yvonne lines.
[7011.28 → 7011.64] Yeah,
[7011.70 → 7012.22] that's good.
[7012.22 → 7013.82] All right.
[7014.04 → 7014.72] Logan Paul
[7014.72 → 7015.82] sues Coffeyville
[7015.82 → 7016.72] for defamation.
[7017.06 → 7017.56] Oh boy.
[7017.80 → 7018.14] Investigation YouTuber
[7018.14 → 7018.72] Coffeyville
[7018.72 → 7019.48] is being sued
[7019.48 → 7020.30] for defamation
[7020.30 → 7021.60] by pro wrestler
[7021.60 → 7022.98] and fellow YouTuber
[7022.98 → 7024.10] Logan Paul.
[7024.34 → 7024.72] Oh,
[7024.72 → 7025.06] okay.
[7026.10 → 7026.42] I mean,
[7026.46 → 7026.82] he is,
[7026.86 → 7027.24] isn't he?
[7028.42 → 7029.34] Doesn't he fight
[7029.34 → 7030.16] in the WWE
[7030.16 → 7030.74] or whatever?
[7031.74 → 7032.48] I guess technically
[7032.48 → 7033.30] anything you've been
[7033.30 → 7033.98] paid to do,
[7034.08 → 7034.76] you're a professional
[7034.76 → 7035.08] at,
[7035.16 → 7035.48] so sure.
[7036.50 → 7036.76] Yeah.
[7037.50 → 7037.92] Well,
[7038.00 → 7038.60] Logan Paul
[7038.60 → 7039.24] and Coffeyville
[7039.24 → 7040.12] have a tenuous
[7040.12 → 7040.72] relationship.
[7041.10 → 7041.76] Since Coffeyville
[7041.76 → 7042.72] did an exposé
[7042.72 → 7043.98] on Logan Paul's
[7043.98 → 7044.76] NFT slash
[7044.76 → 7045.32] crypto game
[7045.32 → 7046.22] called Crypto Zoo,
[7046.38 → 7047.10] this lawsuit
[7047.10 → 7047.76] doesn't have
[7047.76 → 7048.64] to do with that,
[7048.96 → 7050.60] with that reporting,
[7050.92 → 7051.68] though Paul did
[7051.68 → 7052.32] threaten to sue
[7052.32 → 7053.02] for those videos
[7053.02 → 7054.32] but dropped the threats.
[7054.66 → 7054.98] Instead,
[7055.18 → 7055.58] the lawsuit
[7055.58 → 7056.66] is primarily focused
[7056.66 → 7057.38] on a tweet
[7057.38 → 7058.24] from Coffeyville
[7058.24 → 7058.80] that reads,
[7059.18 → 7059.78] Logan Paul
[7059.78 → 7060.86] really is the type
[7060.86 → 7061.30] of dude
[7061.30 → 7062.66] to thank you
[7062.66 → 7063.56] when you expose
[7063.56 → 7064.18] his scam
[7064.18 → 7065.32] then block you
[7065.32 → 7066.08] when you remind
[7066.08 → 7066.76] him to pay up.
[7067.28 → 7067.64] The tweet
[7067.64 → 7069.52] is referencing,
[7070.38 → 7070.64] no,
[7070.80 → 7071.02] the tweet
[7071.02 → 7071.68] is referring
[7071.68 → 7072.32] to Paul's
[7072.32 → 7073.32] announced buyback
[7073.32 → 7074.12] of crypto assets
[7074.12 → 7074.80] from the community
[7074.80 → 7075.66] that invested
[7075.66 → 7076.36] in Crypto Zoo
[7076.36 → 7077.68] that only promised
[7077.68 → 7078.14] to cover
[7078.14 → 7078.88] a fraction
[7078.88 → 7079.42] of the money
[7079.42 → 7080.30] invested
[7080.30 → 7080.96] and apparently
[7080.96 → 7081.86] has not yet
[7081.86 → 7082.76] materialized.
[7083.40 → 7083.70] Thankfully,
[7083.84 → 7084.30] to protect
[7084.30 → 7085.14] from frivolous
[7085.14 → 7085.60] lawsuits,
[7085.94 → 7086.36] Coffeyville
[7086.36 → 7087.22] has media
[7087.22 → 7087.90] insurance
[7087.90 → 7088.92] or errors
[7088.92 → 7089.42] and omissions
[7089.42 → 7090.02] insurance,
[7090.30 → 7091.02] which is standard
[7091.02 → 7091.92] insurance for many
[7091.92 → 7092.70] media outlets
[7092.70 → 7094.06] to use when being
[7094.06 → 7094.90] sued for things
[7094.90 → 7095.52] like defamation,
[7095.88 → 7097.06] except his insurance
[7097.06 → 7097.78] company refuses
[7097.78 → 7098.70] to cover his claim,
[7099.06 → 7100.00] meaning that Coffeyville
[7100.00 → 7100.96] will have to pay
[7100.96 → 7102.78] expenses out of pocket.
[7103.78 → 7104.10] Yokes.
[7104.10 → 7105.82] To help fund
[7105.82 → 7106.20] their defence,
[7106.32 → 7106.64] Coffeyville
[7106.64 → 7107.62] has done a
[7107.62 → 7108.34] merch drop,
[7108.52 → 7109.20] which can be found
[7109.20 → 7110.48] at CoffeeZilla.store.
[7110.74 → 7110.96] Okay,
[7111.02 → 7111.72] so there's a couple
[7111.72 → 7112.62] of things here
[7112.62 → 7114.60] that I feel like
[7114.60 → 7115.12] are necessary
[7115.12 → 7116.22] to talk about.
[7116.78 → 7117.60] His insurance
[7117.60 → 7118.32] company failing
[7118.32 → 7119.14] to cover him
[7119.14 → 7120.48] is due to
[7120.48 → 7121.24] sort of
[7121.24 → 7122.56] comedy of errors
[7122.56 → 7124.28] where I think
[7124.28 → 7125.48] Coffeyville's
[7125.48 → 7126.26] existing
[7126.26 → 7128.26] errors and
[7128.26 → 7128.56] omissions
[7128.56 → 7129.20] coverage
[7129.20 → 7130.22] was expiring,
[7130.22 → 7130.86] so he asked
[7130.86 → 7131.36] to get a new
[7131.36 → 7132.24] one and
[7132.24 → 7132.70] then they got
[7132.70 → 7133.02] him a new
[7133.02 → 7133.68] one and
[7133.68 → 7134.14] he was like,
[7134.22 → 7134.34] hey,
[7134.44 → 7134.78] but does it
[7134.78 → 7135.32] have this
[7135.32 → 7135.60] coverage?
[7135.66 → 7135.86] And they're
[7135.86 → 7136.08] like,
[7136.18 → 7136.44] yeah,
[7136.54 → 7136.94] and then he
[7136.94 → 7137.42] didn't read
[7137.42 → 7138.20] it and
[7138.20 → 7138.76] it turns out
[7138.76 → 7139.36] it didn't.
[7140.00 → 7141.22] So who's
[7141.22 → 7142.12] liable for
[7142.12 → 7143.68] his insurance
[7143.68 → 7144.36] not covering
[7144.36 → 7145.40] this is
[7145.40 → 7147.16] probably TBD
[7147.16 → 7148.18] after some
[7148.18 → 7149.06] kind of legal
[7149.06 → 7150.00] process pays
[7150.00 → 7150.24] out,
[7150.34 → 7150.72] but that's
[7150.72 → 7151.42] what I believe
[7151.42 → 7152.06] we know so
[7152.06 → 7152.50] far.
[7154.16 → 7154.84] The other
[7154.84 → 7155.56] thing is
[7155.56 → 7156.72] a lot of
[7156.72 → 7157.58] people don't
[7157.58 → 7157.98] seem to
[7157.98 → 7158.86] understand what
[7158.86 → 7159.52] defamation
[7159.52 → 7160.12] is.
[7160.74 → 7161.58] It's a word
[7161.58 → 7162.52] that I've
[7162.52 → 7163.24] used before,
[7163.72 → 7164.30] it's a word
[7164.30 → 7164.80] that we've
[7164.80 → 7165.64] used before
[7165.64 → 7166.56] as a company,
[7166.56 → 7167.66] and it has
[7167.66 → 7168.06] a really
[7168.06 → 7169.52] specific meaning
[7169.52 → 7170.34] that I think
[7170.34 → 7170.96] a lot of
[7170.96 → 7171.96] people do
[7171.96 → 7172.90] not understand.
[7173.20 → 7174.06] If you were
[7174.06 → 7174.36] to say
[7174.36 → 7175.06] something like,
[7175.28 → 7175.50] hey,
[7175.96 → 7177.34] don't do a
[7177.34 → 7177.96] defamation
[7177.96 → 7178.82] about me,
[7179.22 → 7180.14] don't defame
[7180.14 → 7180.44] me,
[7180.68 → 7181.44] that doesn't
[7181.44 → 7181.86] mean you
[7181.86 → 7182.30] can't say
[7182.30 → 7183.08] anything negative.
[7183.80 → 7184.18] You can
[7184.18 → 7185.28] absolutely say
[7185.28 → 7186.04] something negative.
[7186.86 → 7187.18] You just
[7187.18 → 7187.66] better be
[7187.66 → 7188.44] damn good
[7188.44 → 7188.78] and sure
[7188.78 → 7189.20] that it's
[7189.20 → 7189.68] true.
[7190.52 → 7191.24] Defamation
[7191.24 → 7192.56] is saying
[7192.56 → 7193.36] something about
[7193.36 → 7194.38] someone that
[7194.38 → 7195.24] damages their
[7195.24 → 7195.86] reputation
[7195.86 → 7198.36] and isn't
[7198.36 → 7199.26] true.
[7199.84 → 7200.22] Now,
[7200.48 → 7201.40] the definition
[7201.40 → 7202.28] of truth
[7202.28 → 7203.16] and who the
[7203.16 → 7204.04] onus is on
[7204.04 → 7205.12] to prove the
[7205.12 → 7206.06] veracity of the
[7206.06 → 7206.96] claims is
[7206.96 → 7207.58] going to vary
[7207.58 → 7208.76] from region
[7208.76 → 7209.44] to region
[7209.44 → 7211.44] depending on
[7211.44 → 7212.72] how the laws
[7212.72 → 7213.20] are worded
[7213.20 → 7213.56] and how
[7213.56 → 7214.36] everything is
[7214.36 → 7214.70] set up.
[7214.70 → 7216.70] but functionally
[7216.70 → 7218.50] defamation,
[7219.26 → 7219.72] slander,
[7220.40 → 7220.80] libel,
[7221.04 → 7221.84] all of these
[7221.84 → 7222.48] things are
[7222.48 → 7223.56] only bad
[7223.56 → 7224.46] if what you're
[7224.46 → 7225.32] saying is
[7225.32 → 7226.16] not true.
[7229.66 → 7230.46] So,
[7231.16 → 7234.26] our discussion
[7234.26 → 7234.98] question here
[7234.98 → 7236.54] is how
[7236.54 → 7237.46] does one
[7237.46 → 7238.30] defame
[7238.30 → 7239.00] someone with a
[7239.00 → 7239.82] reputation as
[7239.82 → 7240.30] bad as
[7240.30 → 7241.08] Logan Paul's?
[7245.82 → 7246.50] That's funny.
[7246.72 → 7247.18] It can still
[7247.18 → 7248.06] obviously happen.
[7249.32 → 7249.60] Yeah.
[7250.26 → 7251.08] This is going to
[7251.08 → 7251.50] be a really
[7251.50 → 7251.98] tough one
[7251.98 → 7252.90] because as
[7252.90 → 7253.40] far as I
[7253.40 → 7253.88] can tell,
[7254.76 → 7255.04] Logan,
[7255.16 → 7255.32] yeah,
[7255.42 → 7255.88] by the way,
[7256.04 → 7256.58] not legal
[7256.58 → 7256.98] advice,
[7257.26 → 7258.22] but I just
[7258.22 → 7258.66] want to make
[7258.66 → 7259.04] it really
[7259.04 → 7259.36] clear,
[7259.44 → 7259.76] guys,
[7260.14 → 7261.92] that there
[7261.92 → 7262.48] is nothing
[7262.48 → 7263.30] wrong with
[7263.30 → 7264.04] saying something
[7264.04 → 7265.08] about someone
[7265.08 → 7266.08] that hurts
[7266.08 → 7266.82] their reputation
[7266.82 → 7267.72] that is
[7267.72 → 7268.16] true.
[7268.94 → 7269.48] And
[7269.48 → 7270.32] personally,
[7270.56 → 7271.94] I have never
[7271.94 → 7272.76] objected to
[7272.76 → 7273.32] someone saying
[7273.32 → 7273.90] something about
[7273.90 → 7274.88] me that hurts
[7274.88 → 7275.50] my reputation
[7275.50 → 7275.90] that is
[7275.90 → 7276.22] true.
[7276.38 → 7276.94] My only
[7276.94 → 7277.68] objection has
[7277.68 → 7278.34] ever been
[7278.34 → 7279.04] when someone
[7279.04 → 7279.68] says something
[7279.68 → 7280.16] that damages
[7280.16 → 7280.82] my reputation
[7280.82 → 7281.90] that is not
[7281.90 → 7282.60] in fact
[7282.60 → 7283.38] true.
[7283.60 → 7284.06] So,
[7284.14 → 7284.68] this is where
[7284.68 → 7285.64] Logan Paul is
[7285.64 → 7286.26] going to have
[7286.26 → 7286.48] to,
[7286.98 → 7287.94] is going to
[7287.94 → 7288.16] have,
[7288.34 → 7288.86] I guess,
[7288.98 → 7290.92] a challenge
[7290.92 → 7291.86] ahead of him
[7291.86 → 7292.46] to prove
[7292.46 → 7292.86] that what
[7292.86 → 7293.36] Coffeyville
[7293.36 → 7293.86] said
[7293.86 → 7295.26] was
[7295.26 → 7296.10] untrue
[7296.10 → 7297.02] or misleading
[7297.02 → 7297.88] and also
[7297.88 → 7298.60] damaged his
[7298.60 → 7299.16] reputation.
[7300.10 → 7300.44] If you want
[7300.44 → 7300.78] a deeper
[7300.78 → 7301.24] dive into
[7301.24 → 7301.58] the legal
[7301.58 → 7301.98] side of
[7301.98 → 7302.10] it,
[7302.26 → 7303.56] not Coffeyville,
[7303.88 → 7304.44] Legal Eagle
[7304.44 → 7305.82] has a video
[7305.82 → 7306.50] from two weeks
[7306.50 → 7307.86] ago that
[7307.86 → 7308.52] goes over
[7308.52 → 7309.06] the case.
[7312.34 → 7312.86] Man,
[7312.94 → 7313.58] it's wild.
[7313.80 → 7314.28] Maybe check that out.
[7314.54 → 7315.44] In Coffeyville's
[7315.44 → 7315.98] line of work,
[7316.02 → 7317.06] it is wild
[7317.06 → 7317.68] that he was
[7317.68 → 7318.22] without errors
[7318.22 → 7318.60] and emissions
[7318.60 → 7319.14] insurance.
[7319.54 → 7319.66] So,
[7319.74 → 7320.06] errors and
[7320.06 → 7320.32] emissions
[7320.32 → 7320.94] insurance
[7320.94 → 7321.84] would cover
[7321.84 → 7322.72] if you
[7322.72 → 7323.42] accidentally
[7323.42 → 7324.36] defamed
[7324.36 → 7324.76] someone.
[7325.12 → 7325.34] So,
[7325.40 → 7325.72] it's kind
[7325.72 → 7326.28] of a
[7326.28 → 7326.92] CYA
[7326.92 → 7329.48] for,
[7329.66 → 7329.74] yeah,
[7329.74 → 7330.38] if he did
[7330.38 → 7331.00] accidentally
[7331.00 → 7331.68] defame him.
[7331.96 → 7332.52] Looking at
[7332.52 → 7333.14] this tweet,
[7333.24 → 7333.44] though,
[7333.94 → 7334.48] that feels
[7334.48 → 7334.86] like it's
[7334.86 → 7335.12] going to be
[7335.12 → 7335.48] a really
[7335.48 → 7335.94] difficult
[7335.94 → 7337.12] case for
[7337.12 → 7337.64] Logan Paul
[7337.64 → 7338.04] to prove.
[7338.14 → 7338.24] Like,
[7338.26 → 7338.62] maybe the
[7338.62 → 7339.04] plan is
[7339.04 → 7339.46] just to
[7339.46 → 7340.20] bury him
[7340.20 → 7341.54] in legal
[7341.54 → 7342.22] fees as
[7342.22 → 7342.76] opposed to
[7342.76 → 7343.34] actually
[7343.34 → 7344.66] collect any
[7344.66 → 7345.08] money from
[7345.08 → 7345.18] him.
[7345.24 → 7345.50] I also
[7345.50 → 7346.14] can't imagine
[7346.14 → 7346.58] that Logan
[7346.58 → 7347.38] Paul really
[7347.38 → 7347.76] needs the
[7347.76 → 7348.14] money from
[7348.14 → 7348.64] Coffeyville.
[7348.64 → 7355.90] give me
[7355.90 → 7356.30] one quick
[7356.30 → 7356.50] second,
[7356.58 → 7356.68] I'll be
[7356.68 → 7356.92] right back.
[7362.20 → 7362.72] Yeah,
[7362.88 → 7363.28] okay.
[7363.52 → 7364.34] He apparently
[7364.34 → 7365.58] specifically chose
[7365.58 → 7366.78] a state that
[7366.78 → 7367.52] didn't have
[7367.52 → 7368.48] anti-Slav
[7368.48 → 7369.20] laws.
[7369.42 → 7369.76] So,
[7369.82 → 7370.52] the idea is
[7370.52 → 7371.06] just to bury
[7371.06 → 7371.50] him in legal
[7371.50 → 7371.82] fees.
[7371.82 → 7374.94] SLAPP,
[7375.02 → 7375.38] I forget
[7375.38 → 7376.08] the exact,
[7376.26 → 7376.66] I forget
[7376.66 → 7376.94] what it
[7376.94 → 7377.62] stands for,
[7378.04 → 7378.94] but basically
[7378.94 → 7380.82] it's a
[7380.82 → 7381.34] frivolous
[7381.34 → 7382.12] lawsuit that's
[7382.12 → 7382.74] just designed
[7382.74 → 7383.56] to waste
[7383.56 → 7384.00] someone's
[7384.00 → 7384.34] time and
[7384.34 → 7384.56] money.
[7384.94 → 7385.50] Strategic
[7385.50 → 7386.12] lawsuit
[7386.12 → 7386.74] against
[7386.74 → 7387.28] public
[7387.28 → 7388.10] participation.
[7388.86 → 7389.20] There you
[7389.20 → 7389.44] go.
[7389.66 → 7389.90] Okay.
[7392.04 → 7392.52] Man,
[7392.66 → 7393.18] this is
[7393.18 → 7394.24] wild.
[7395.52 → 7395.76] Well,
[7396.20 → 7396.64] good luck
[7396.64 → 7396.96] with that
[7396.96 → 7397.50] Logan Paul,
[7397.64 → 7398.36] but especially
[7398.36 → 7399.08] good luck
[7399.08 → 7399.40] with that
[7399.40 → 7399.88] Coffeyville.
[7400.04 → 7400.36] I want to
[7400.36 → 7400.78] go check
[7400.78 → 7401.12] out,
[7401.12 → 7403.62] okay.
[7404.00 → 7404.42] Riley's
[7404.42 → 7404.84] adding some
[7404.84 → 7405.22] stuff because
[7405.22 → 7405.62] apparently he's
[7405.62 → 7406.36] watching WAN show.
[7406.84 → 7406.94] So,
[7407.06 → 7407.56] his insurance
[7407.56 → 7409.04] company added
[7409.04 → 7410.84] specific exemptions
[7410.84 → 7411.48] to his agreement
[7411.48 → 7412.08] saying they
[7412.08 → 7413.18] wouldn't cover
[7413.18 → 7413.82] defamation and
[7413.82 → 7414.12] errors and
[7414.12 → 7414.40] emissions.
[7414.60 → 7415.08] It wasn't
[7415.08 → 7415.64] caught by
[7415.64 → 7416.18] Coffeyville's
[7416.18 → 7417.12] team or
[7417.12 → 7417.70] insurance
[7417.70 → 7418.24] broker.
[7419.00 → 7419.42] Coffeyville
[7419.42 → 7419.86] thinks they
[7419.86 → 7420.12] may have
[7420.12 → 7420.64] scammed him
[7420.64 → 7421.42] but cannot
[7421.42 → 7422.32] be sure.
[7423.24 → 7423.42] And
[7423.42 → 7424.02] insurance
[7424.02 → 7424.62] brokers are
[7424.62 → 7425.00] one of those
[7425.00 → 7425.66] things like
[7425.66 → 7426.16] dude,
[7426.80 → 7427.38] Dan,
[7427.54 → 7427.88] have you ever
[7427.88 → 7428.38] used a travel
[7428.38 → 7428.60] agent?
[7429.86 → 7430.34] No,
[7430.50 → 7430.68] I don't
[7430.68 → 7431.10] think so.
[7431.12 → 7431.56] Okay.
[7432.86 → 7433.58] It's one of
[7433.58 → 7434.00] those things
[7434.00 → 7435.22] where they
[7435.22 → 7436.10] claim that
[7436.10 → 7436.64] they can
[7436.64 → 7437.10] save you
[7437.10 → 7437.34] money,
[7437.70 → 7438.96] but they
[7438.96 → 7439.34] take a
[7439.34 → 7439.58] cut.
[7441.42 → 7441.90] So,
[7442.14 → 7443.56] how does
[7443.56 → 7443.86] the math
[7443.86 → 7444.24] work on
[7444.24 → 7444.44] that?
[7446.36 → 7447.32] Every single
[7447.32 → 7447.72] time,
[7447.84 → 7448.18] whether we're
[7448.18 → 7448.84] talking insurance
[7448.84 → 7449.16] brokers,
[7449.30 → 7449.86] mortgage brokers,
[7450.04 → 7450.66] travel agents,
[7450.76 → 7451.52] every single
[7451.52 → 7452.70] time when
[7452.70 → 7453.16] there is an
[7453.16 → 7454.30] opportunity to
[7454.30 → 7454.92] cut out a
[7454.92 → 7455.68] middle person,
[7456.38 → 7457.00] Yvonne has
[7457.00 → 7457.50] been able to
[7457.50 → 7458.10] negotiate a
[7458.10 → 7458.64] better deal
[7458.64 → 7459.80] than through
[7459.80 → 7460.22] a broker
[7460.22 → 7461.42] and with
[7461.42 → 7461.78] fewer
[7461.78 → 7462.44] communication
[7462.44 → 7463.10] breakdowns.
[7463.10 → 7464.00] I know in
[7464.00 → 7464.72] some cases
[7464.72 → 7465.24] insurance,
[7465.48 → 7465.70] there's
[7465.70 → 7466.32] absolutely
[7466.32 → 7467.68] no way to
[7467.68 → 7468.22] get away from
[7468.22 → 7468.60] brokers,
[7469.34 → 7470.58] but I
[7470.58 → 7470.90] just,
[7471.16 → 7472.46] I hate
[7472.46 → 7474.02] adding extra
[7474.02 → 7475.42] middle persons
[7475.42 → 7477.22] with their
[7477.22 → 7478.00] extra cuts
[7478.00 → 7478.94] and with their
[7478.94 → 7479.72] extra potential
[7479.72 → 7480.68] for communications
[7480.68 → 7481.38] to break down.
[7481.38 → 7481.78] and I'm about
[7481.78 → 7482.38] to say something
[7482.38 → 7483.02] that might be
[7483.02 → 7483.86] pretty unpopular
[7483.86 → 7484.36] with some of
[7484.36 → 7484.70] the people
[7484.70 → 7485.28] that we
[7485.28 → 7485.94] work with
[7485.94 → 7486.52] professionally,
[7486.78 → 7487.70] but agencies,
[7488.06 → 7489.08] marketing agencies
[7489.08 → 7489.64] are another
[7489.64 → 7490.48] example of that.
[7491.00 → 7492.22] I can't think
[7492.22 → 7492.84] of very many,
[7492.92 → 7493.72] I can think
[7493.72 → 7494.10] of some,
[7494.80 → 7495.30] I'm not going
[7495.30 → 7495.66] to name any
[7495.66 → 7496.06] names here,
[7496.12 → 7497.22] but I can't
[7497.22 → 7498.42] think of many
[7498.42 → 7500.36] situations where
[7500.36 → 7501.62] our engagement
[7501.62 → 7502.58] with a brand
[7502.58 → 7504.06] was enhanced
[7504.06 → 7505.16] by dealing
[7505.16 → 7506.14] with a creative
[7506.14 → 7506.82] or a marketing
[7506.82 → 7507.32] agency.
[7507.90 → 7509.02] It generally
[7509.02 → 7509.70] just adds
[7509.70 → 7510.36] complexity
[7510.36 → 7511.96] reduces
[7511.96 → 7515.18] how far
[7515.18 → 7515.58] the budget
[7515.58 → 7516.12] will stretch
[7516.12 → 7516.62] because they
[7516.62 → 7517.20] always take
[7517.20 → 7517.58] a cut
[7517.58 → 7518.62] and
[7518.62 → 7520.50] generally
[7520.50 → 7521.06] reduces
[7521.06 → 7521.70] the amount
[7521.70 → 7522.54] of information
[7522.54 → 7523.16] that we can
[7523.16 → 7523.50] get.
[7523.84 → 7524.32] It just,
[7524.66 → 7524.80] yeah,
[7524.94 → 7525.92] it's terrible.
[7526.38 → 7527.28] Basically terrible.
[7529.90 → 7531.06] Vinny says
[7531.06 → 7532.06] often travel agents
[7532.06 → 7532.70] receive deals
[7532.70 → 7533.22] directly from
[7533.22 → 7533.82] hotels and tour
[7533.82 → 7534.48] operators that you
[7534.48 → 7534.92] may not have
[7534.92 → 7535.52] access to.
[7536.04 → 7536.52] Except,
[7536.70 → 7536.94] Vinny,
[7537.36 → 7538.06] if you call
[7538.06 → 7538.72] that hotel
[7538.72 → 7539.64] and say,
[7539.80 → 7539.92] hey,
[7539.92 → 7540.60] my travel agent
[7540.60 → 7541.26] offered me this
[7541.26 → 7541.54] deal,
[7541.74 → 7542.56] they will often
[7542.56 → 7543.18] give you a better
[7543.18 → 7543.44] deal.
[7544.18 → 7544.86] Because money
[7544.86 → 7545.44] is just money.
[7546.90 → 7547.60] Money is money.
[7549.02 → 7549.80] And if they have
[7549.80 → 7550.26] to give someone
[7550.26 → 7550.96] else some of it,
[7551.40 → 7553.00] then they'd be
[7553.00 → 7553.94] better off negotiating
[7553.94 → 7554.60] with you directly.
[7556.32 → 7556.90] That's just,
[7557.00 → 7557.96] that's just how it is.
[7560.28 → 7561.02] Kelly says,
[7561.10 → 7561.94] I used a travel agent
[7561.94 → 7562.50] that may not have
[7562.50 → 7563.34] saved me any money,
[7563.42 → 7563.88] but they saved me
[7563.88 → 7564.42] a ton of time.
[7564.70 → 7565.70] And that's fair enough.
[7565.70 → 7567.82] my problem is that
[7567.82 → 7568.16] I'm not talking
[7568.16 → 7569.04] about travel agents
[7569.04 → 7569.28] though.
[7569.38 → 7570.02] I was.
[7570.46 → 7571.04] I was just talking
[7571.04 → 7571.88] about middle men.
[7573.08 → 7573.96] My problem though
[7573.96 → 7574.80] is I have a Yvonne
[7574.80 → 7576.48] who will always
[7576.48 → 7577.30] do a better job
[7577.30 → 7578.66] than like the travel
[7578.66 → 7579.44] agent would do anyway.
[7579.58 → 7580.72] So it's really tough.
[7583.52 → 7584.62] All right.
[7584.88 → 7585.20] Oh yeah,
[7585.26 → 7585.44] right.
[7585.44 → 7586.16] I wanted to check out
[7586.16 → 7587.22] the store.
[7587.86 → 7588.04] Okay,
[7588.08 → 7589.26] where's the link?
[7589.26 → 7590.04] Where'd the link go?
[7590.04 → 7592.34] Oh,
[7592.42 → 7593.16] coffeezilla.store.
[7593.30 → 7593.56] There it is.
[7594.06 → 7594.24] Yeah.
[7594.72 → 7595.72] I just typed it.
[7595.96 → 7596.36] Have you checked
[7596.36 → 7596.84] anything out?
[7597.42 → 7597.92] Is it any good?
[7597.94 → 7598.18] Yeah.
[7598.32 → 7598.50] The
[7598.56 → 7598.90] uh,
[7598.90 → 7599.32] thank you.
[7599.36 → 7600.10] I'm suing shirt.
[7600.20 → 7600.78] It's pretty cool.
[7604.34 → 7605.26] What is this?
[7606.18 → 7607.14] I'm suing.
[7607.30 → 7607.62] Okay.
[7607.74 → 7608.02] Yeah.
[7609.44 → 7610.50] I used to like
[7610.50 → 7611.60] Coffeyville until he
[7611.60 → 7612.52] investigated me.
[7613.16 → 7613.96] That's awesome.
[7614.06 → 7614.78] I want that one.
[7616.36 → 7617.04] It's going to,
[7617.46 → 7618.22] I think I might
[7618.22 → 7619.06] actually buy that
[7619.06 → 7620.06] because,
[7620.20 → 7620.56] uh,
[7621.20 → 7621.74] hold on.
[7623.26 → 7624.00] Here we go.
[7629.90 → 7630.26] Coffeyville.
[7630.48 → 7630.84] Boom.
[7631.44 → 7631.80] Investigated.
[7631.86 → 7632.54] Look at this guy.
[7632.90 → 7633.54] Look at this mug.
[7633.56 → 7634.44] He looks guilty.
[7637.88 → 7638.08] It's a
[7638.08 → 7638.72] it's a different guy.
[7638.78 → 7639.52] That guy has a beard.
[7639.82 → 7640.14] Yeah,
[7640.14 → 7640.52] I know.
[7640.52 → 7640.76] Right.
[7641.18 → 7642.36] Did he do us only once
[7642.36 → 7643.36] or did he do us more than once?
[7643.36 → 7644.38] Did Linus dye his hair
[7644.38 → 7645.14] and shave his beard
[7645.14 → 7646.42] to escape controversy?
[7647.24 → 7647.54] All right.
[7647.56 → 7647.76] Did he,
[7647.86 → 7649.00] did he only do us the one time?
[7649.22 → 7649.62] All right.
[7651.36 → 7651.70] Okay.
[7651.74 → 7652.44] I'm doing it.
[7653.36 → 7653.72] 39,
[7653.84 → 7654.42] $38.
[7654.80 → 7655.08] Okay.
[7655.14 → 7655.40] All right.
[7655.48 → 7655.66] Fine,
[7655.72 → 7655.88] fine,
[7655.94 → 7656.08] fine,
[7656.14 → 7656.30] fine,
[7656.30 → 7656.48] fine,
[7656.48 → 7656.68] fine,
[7656.68 → 7656.82] fine,
[7656.82 → 7656.90] fine,
[7656.90 → 7657.00] fine,
[7657.00 → 7657.18] fine.
[7657.94 → 7658.34] Uh,
[7658.54 → 7658.92] Ooh,
[7658.96 → 7660.66] there's a long sleeve.
[7662.02 → 7662.34] Okay.
[7663.00 → 7664.40] I think I might need this one.
[7665.48 → 7666.20] Heck yeah.
[7666.32 → 7667.36] Let's go.
[7667.76 → 7668.42] Add to car.
[7668.56 → 7668.80] Actually,
[7668.86 → 7670.14] I haven't even looked at everything yet.
[7670.18 → 7670.34] Okay.
[7670.34 → 7670.54] Sorry.
[7670.56 → 7671.82] I'm actually just shopping right now.
[7671.92 → 7673.36] If you guys want to hang out and shop with me,
[7673.38 → 7673.88] then that's cool.
[7673.92 → 7674.90] If you want Luke to do a topic,
[7674.98 → 7675.60] that's cool too.
[7676.40 → 7676.60] No,
[7676.64 → 7677.34] let's just shop.
[7677.46 → 7678.58] Just don't check it on stream,
[7678.66 → 7678.90] please.
[7679.48 → 7679.64] Yeah,
[7679.64 → 7679.80] yeah,
[7679.80 → 7679.94] yeah,
[7679.94 → 7680.10] yeah,
[7680.10 → 7680.22] yeah.
[7680.22 → 7680.98] Just relax,
[7681.08 → 7681.22] buddy.
[7681.32 → 7682.20] Just going to check out on stream.
[7682.26 → 7683.06] Just relax.
[7683.06 → 7685.24] You would absolutely do it.
[7685.46 → 7686.24] Are they all t-shirts?
[7686.38 → 7687.30] He should have a screwdriver.
[7688.26 → 7689.90] We should do a Coffeyville defence screwdriver.
[7689.90 → 7690.60] You know what?
[7690.74 → 7691.92] I just want to shout out,
[7692.10 → 7695.30] I want to shout out Coffeyville for posing in his own merch.
[7696.24 → 7696.54] Okay?
[7696.84 → 7697.82] I hate that.
[7698.46 → 7703.56] When a YouTuber thinks a drop is cool enough for you to spend money on it,
[7703.64 → 7707.86] but doesn't think it's cool enough to take 15 minutes out of their day
[7707.86 → 7711.00] and put the merch on and be in the picture.
[7711.16 → 7713.18] He's gone a step above beyond that too.
[7713.26 → 7713.92] This is awesome.
[7714.08 → 7716.22] Look at the backgrounds, and they're like colour matched.
[7716.44 → 7717.14] It's sick.
[7717.92 → 7718.56] This is great.
[7719.46 → 7719.64] Yeah,
[7719.64 → 7720.08] these are cool.
[7720.38 → 7720.60] Yeah,
[7720.66 → 7721.64] I'm doing this one.
[7722.64 → 7722.74] Wait,
[7722.80 → 7723.24] did I already have that?
[7723.24 → 7723.48] Yeah,
[7723.48 → 7724.38] I already have the cat shirt.
[7725.48 → 7725.78] What?
[7725.94 → 7726.42] Cat one?
[7726.52 → 7727.08] What are you talking about?
[7727.64 → 7727.90] Yeah,
[7727.96 → 7729.66] the thank-you I'm suing shirt is a cat.
[7729.66 → 7730.66] Um,
[7732.74 → 7733.02] yeah,
[7733.02 → 7733.62] that's cool,
[7733.76 → 7736.44] but I like the one that speaks directly to me.
[7737.04 → 7737.50] I mean,
[7737.52 → 7738.68] the cat is pretty cool.
[7740.04 → 7740.40] Yeah,
[7740.46 → 7740.84] and it's like,
[7740.90 → 7743.00] it's topical because it talks about how like when,
[7743.06 → 7745.24] when Logan Paul thanked him at the beginning and then,
[7745.24 → 7746.26] uh,
[7746.30 → 7749.88] kind of turned around and is now trying to sue him and all that kind of stuff.
[7751.10 → 7751.46] Yeah,
[7751.68 → 7751.90] no,
[7751.92 → 7752.60] I like the one I like.
[7753.88 → 7757.18] I like the one that I can pretend is him addressing me directly.
[7759.66 → 7760.74] To be clear,
[7760.86 → 7761.18] I never,
[7761.30 → 7761.72] I never,
[7761.90 → 7763.40] I never stopped liking Coffeyville.
[7763.52 → 7769.80] I think I actually wasn't even aware of his video until we were talking about Coffeyville covering someone else on the show.
[7770.00 → 7770.78] And someone was like,
[7770.86 → 7770.96] yo,
[7771.04 → 7773.44] Coffeyville covered you before or something like that.
[7773.48 → 7773.88] I forget.
[7777.28 → 7777.72] Yeah.
[7780.02 → 7780.90] M Leaper says,
[7780.98 → 7783.80] was going to say Linus isn't in the photos for the chroma tea on the store,
[7783.94 → 7784.68] but oh,
[7784.92 → 7786.30] he's wearing it right now.
[7786.36 → 7786.92] Let's go.
[7787.20 → 7788.00] Come at me.
[7788.38 → 7789.14] Come at me.
[7789.14 → 7792.22] I will use any product from LTT store.com.
[7793.08 → 7794.20] And if it's good enough for me,
[7794.24 → 7794.98] it's good enough for you.
[7795.04 → 7795.48] Let's go.
[7795.68 → 7795.82] Yeah.
[7795.92 → 7796.34] Give me a sec.
[7797.44 → 7797.64] Oh,
[7797.74 → 7798.12] this guy,
[7798.20 → 7799.14] this guy's going away again.
[7799.16 → 7800.14] He's probably getting hacked.
[7801.16 → 7803.66] Probably getting like def conned.
[7804.04 → 7804.36] Uh,
[7804.38 → 7804.68] all right.
[7805.14 → 7806.88] I guess I will have to check out later,
[7806.88 → 7809.66] but I'm going to have to try to not forget to do this.
[7809.84 → 7810.72] That's going to be really,
[7810.82 → 7811.12] really,
[7811.20 → 7811.36] really,
[7811.42 → 7811.82] really hard.
[7813.92 → 7814.24] Okay.
[7814.78 → 7816.06] What do we want to talk about next,
[7816.18 → 7816.32] Dan?
[7816.38 → 7817.94] Apparently you and I are on it together.
[7817.94 → 7818.56] Hold on.
[7818.62 → 7818.88] Hold on.
[7818.92 → 7819.18] Hold on.
[7819.28 → 7819.46] What?
[7819.82 → 7821.52] Luke has the shirt.
[7822.40 → 7823.04] He has what shirt?
[7823.42 → 7824.68] He has the RGB one.
[7825.22 → 7825.46] Sorry.
[7825.58 → 7825.70] The
[7825.76 → 7826.00] uh,
[7826.40 → 7827.64] I was pointing out that I,
[7827.64 → 7829.40] I wore mine yesterday.
[7829.40 → 7831.60] Oh,
[7831.66 → 7832.02] nice.
[7832.86 → 7833.18] Perfect.
[7834.78 → 7835.34] All right.
[7836.66 → 7838.48] Funding the coffee Villa defence,
[7838.82 → 7839.58] continue to shipping,
[7840.06 → 7840.20] blah,
[7840.24 → 7840.34] blah,
[7840.42 → 7840.56] blah.
[7841.20 → 7841.70] All right.
[7842.08 → 7843.04] What do you want to talk about next,
[7843.10 → 7843.26] Luke?
[7844.86 → 7847.14] Why am I picking all the topics?
[7847.44 → 7848.46] You always pick the topics.
[7849.14 → 7851.04] There's a new one that got added at the top,
[7851.08 → 7851.48] I believe.
[7852.12 → 7852.40] Ooh.
[7852.40 → 7854.04] Oh,
[7854.12 → 7854.82] it's just ready now.
[7855.08 → 7863.86] Two investigations by 404 media expose a Facebook incentivizing AI slop spam and B NVIDIA scraping Netflix, YouTube,
[7863.86 → 7865.58] and AI training.
[7865.58 → 7885.40] Jason Kohler spent months researching where Facebook's grotesque AI spam like shrimp Jesus comes from and found an ecosystem of influencers making courses on YouTube and Telegram teaching people how to use Facebook's creator program bonus to make money churning out AI engagement bait.
[7885.40 → 7888.76] The influencers primarily located in India,
[7888.76 → 7889.38] the Philippines,
[7889.48 → 7890.62] and Vietnam trained,
[7890.62 → 7897.14] trained people to set up an automated system generating prompts like poor people,
[7897.28 → 7901.48] thin body to feed into Microsoft's free AI image generator,
[7901.48 → 7905.58] and then post hundreds of AI generated images on Facebook per day.
[7906.48 → 7910.74] Accounts get approved for monetization after a few days of churning out AI posts.
[7910.74 → 7915.48] One spammer made $431 from a picture of a train made of leaves.
[7916.66 → 7917.80] For their part,
[7917.94 → 7920.10] Facebook does have automated spam detection,
[7920.24 → 7924.30] but these AI spam artisans have complicated ways to avoid it.
[7924.48 → 7924.58] Oh,
[7924.70 → 7924.88] dude.
[7924.94 → 7926.14] Facebook's creator program.
[7926.98 → 7927.26] Okay.
[7927.64 → 7931.48] This article is crazy because you basically,
[7932.14 → 7932.34] the
[7932.52 → 7934.42] I forget what it is.
[7934.48 → 7936.14] You like to make a
[7936.24 → 7940.72] you make a WordPress site, and then you like link it to something.
[7940.74 → 7941.94] else on the backend.
[7942.30 → 7945.78] And then it like posts on your behalf.
[7945.78 → 7948.42] And because you,
[7948.54 → 7948.82] it,
[7948.82 → 7951.28] it like turns into an ad on Facebook,
[7951.28 → 7952.88] but it's not an ad,
[7952.88 → 7955.16] but it like looks like a certain type of content.
[7955.16 → 7956.34] So when people click it,
[7956.38 → 7957.72] they think they're opening a gallery,
[7957.72 → 7959.84] but actually they're just going to a site.
[7959.84 → 7960.06] Like,
[7960.38 → 7961.94] like all the ways that it's interconnected.
[7961.94 → 7963.48] I'm looking at this going like,
[7963.48 → 7965.94] dude,
[7966.00 → 7966.68] it's just Facebook.
[7966.68 → 7967.68] Like really?
[7967.68 → 7968.32] Really?
[7968.52 → 7970.76] But apparently people are making serious.
[7970.76 → 7971.38] Yeah.
[7971.48 → 7972.64] Serious money at this.
[7973.50 → 7973.68] Yeah.
[7975.04 → 7979.56] Facebook's creator program page says it incentivizes original content,
[7979.56 → 7983.30] which does technically describe newly generated AI images.
[7983.82 → 7984.24] Jason,
[7984.84 → 7985.34] um,
[7985.94 → 7986.50] or the
[7986.50 → 7989.04] the author's takeaways are that obviously,
[7989.04 → 7989.76] uh,
[7989.76 → 7992.90] don't fault the people who are making money this way.
[7992.90 → 7993.34] Yeah.
[7993.36 → 7993.62] I mean,
[7993.66 → 7993.92] there,
[7994.06 → 8000.98] a lot of them are coming from places where they don't necessarily have a lot of opportunities.
[8001.40 → 8001.76] Um,
[8002.18 → 8004.46] now that doesn't mean that I think it's great.
[8005.92 → 8006.36] However,
[8006.36 → 8008.16] if you read the article,
[8008.28 → 8008.44] Luke,
[8008.50 → 8009.56] I read it before the show.
[8009.58 → 8010.50] If you read the article,
[8010.50 → 8013.94] it's clear that this is a systemic problem.
[8014.24 → 8020.06] This is something that Facebook is clearly not motivated to fix.
[8020.06 → 8023.44] And could fix if they wanted to,
[8023.96 → 8025.50] but because yes,
[8025.68 → 8029.34] but because everyone's making money from this,
[8029.34 → 8030.86] just engagement bait,
[8031.70 → 8036.62] Facebook is clearly looking the other way and not closing these loopholes.
[8037.14 → 8039.02] That's where Jason's coming from,
[8039.02 → 8042.14] where don't blame the people that are using this loophole.
[8042.38 → 8042.96] It's,
[8043.00 → 8043.82] it's kind of like a
[8043.90 → 8046.60] it's kind of like tax avoidance basically saying,
[8046.66 → 8046.84] look,
[8046.94 → 8049.52] don't blame the person who should be better.
[8049.52 → 8052.34] Don't blame the person who's minimizing their tax.
[8052.70 → 8054.10] You would do the same thing.
[8054.82 → 8061.22] Blame the lawmakers who are clearly enabling this behaviour and doing nothing to stop it.
[8061.92 → 8066.56] And except for the fact that it's usually the case that the people avoiding the tax are paying the lawmakers to keep it there.
[8066.56 → 8067.62] So you should still blame them.
[8067.98 → 8068.26] Yes.
[8068.60 → 8069.00] Yes.
[8069.02 → 8069.82] But I'm,
[8069.82 → 8071.92] I'm trying to explain where his point is coming from.
[8071.92 → 8072.24] And it's,
[8072.30 → 8075.92] it's just not quite as black and white as I think it came across in the notes.
[8076.56 → 8077.00] Yeah,
[8077.12 → 8077.68] that makes sense.
[8077.68 → 8078.34] Uh,
[8078.34 → 8079.36] American tech companies.
[8079.58 → 8080.22] These are,
[8080.34 → 8081.60] these are the author's takeaways.
[8081.60 → 8081.96] Again,
[8082.14 → 8083.56] American tech companies yet again,
[8083.64 → 8085.72] launched things without understanding how they will be used.
[8085.72 → 8088.14] And our convos about info,
[8089.14 → 8089.62] integrity,
[8089.82 → 8090.32] plagiarism,
[8090.42 → 8090.88] et cetera,
[8090.88 → 8093.22] are very divorced from reality.
[8094.22 → 8094.72] Okay.
[8094.98 → 8095.22] Uh,
[8095.22 → 8096.72] in a separate investigation,
[8096.94 → 8097.60] 404 media,
[8097.76 → 8103.56] Samantha Cole obtained Slack messages and documents showing that to train an AI video model,
[8103.56 → 8110.82] Nvidia scraped as much as 80 hours of video per day from Netflix and super high quality YouTube channels.
[8111.00 → 8111.04] Like,
[8111.18 → 8111.22] yeah,
[8111.22 → 8111.90] wait,
[8112.02 → 8113.14] we talked about this before.
[8113.28 → 8121.02] The only difference is that I think Nvidia has given a statement now saying that their AI training practices are in full compliance with the letter and spirit of copyright law.
[8121.02 → 8121.62] Um,
[8121.62 → 8123.60] so yeah,
[8124.02 → 8124.52] sure.
[8124.52 → 8127.08] That's definitely not saying we didn't do that.
[8127.08 → 8127.36] Uh,
[8127.36 → 8128.54] also get rec Linus.
[8128.64 → 8128.92] Uh,
[8128.92 → 8129.60] you weren't named,
[8129.60 → 8130.10] uh,
[8130.12 → 8132.54] Nvidia compiled a list of,
[8132.72 → 8133.00] sorry,
[8133.06 → 8134.30] I wasn't named in what?
[8135.00 → 8135.30] Yeah,
[8135.46 → 8135.94] they,
[8136.06 → 8136.16] they,
[8136.16 → 8136.28] well,
[8136.30 → 8141.24] they said they scraped 80 hours of video per day from Netflix and super high quality YouTube channels like MKBHD,
[8141.44 → 8141.74] but not,
[8141.74 → 8142.40] not LTT.
[8142.84 → 8143.28] Yikes.
[8144.16 → 8144.72] RIP.
[8145.54 → 8146.06] Uh,
[8146.08 → 8156.00] Nvidia compiled a list of at least 38.5 million video URLs to scrape screenshots show a senior employee discussing downloading the whole Netflix.
[8156.00 → 8156.96] Uh,
[8156.96 → 8166.66] when asked if they had approval for scraping the same senior employee called it an executive decision saying that we have an umbrella approval for all the data.
[8167.74 → 8173.78] In a statement to 404 media and video said it's AI training practices are in full compliance. Like Linus just said,
[8174.06 → 8174.52] uh,
[8174.52 → 8175.54] when asked for comment,
[8175.68 → 8183.48] a Google representative linked 404 media to a Bloomberg interview in which YouTube CEO Neil Johan said that AI,
[8183.48 → 8183.66] uh,
[8183.66 → 8189.76] open AI scraping YouTube to train its Sora video generator would be against YouTube's terms of service.
[8190.76 → 8191.12] Uh,
[8191.46 → 8192.98] which isn't them saying that they,
[8193.08 → 8194.60] that statement to get rid of the heat.
[8194.60 → 8198.08] That isn't them saying that Nvidia wasn't given permission.
[8199.28 → 8200.04] That's true.
[8200.04 → 8206.78] Which would be interesting because back to what I was talking about,
[8207.00 → 8207.42] man,
[8207.48 → 8209.90] it must've been two hours ago on the show or whenever it was,
[8209.96 → 8210.46] um,
[8211.28 → 8212.68] where I said that in general,
[8212.86 → 8215.26] YouTube had built up credibility with me,
[8215.32 → 8217.12] had built up trust with me in the past,
[8217.12 → 8218.98] but has lost it in a big way.
[8219.40 → 8219.68] Um,
[8219.68 → 8225.98] this is a perfect example of one of the kinds of things that I would have assumed YouTube would do the right thing at some point,
[8225.98 → 8231.74] but I would no longer assume YouTube would do the right thing about the obvious right thing for them to do here.
[8231.80 → 8236.84] If they are monetizing my video as a member of the YouTube partner program would be to share that revenue.
[8237.86 → 8242.44] But you look at some of the moves that Google has made more recently,
[8242.44 → 8249.04] like when they opened up monetization on videos on channels that were not enabled for monetization.
[8249.46 → 8249.62] Yeah.
[8249.70 → 8250.50] I was looking at it going,
[8250.60 → 8250.74] Hey,
[8250.78 → 8253.54] you guys recognize that this creates a clear conflict of interest,
[8253.54 → 8253.84] right?
[8253.84 → 8262.78] Like you guys are financially motivated to run ads at a higher rate on channels that are not enabled for the YouTube partner program because you guys keep everything.
[8263.04 → 8267.96] It's not like you take that and share the bucket that would have gone to the creator.
[8268.06 → 8272.92] It's not like you distribute that to other creators on the platform to continue to build this ecosystem.
[8273.04 → 8274.16] You guys are just taking it.
[8274.36 → 8275.92] Whereas when you run an ad on my channel,
[8276.02 → 8276.50] you have to,
[8276.60 → 8277.66] you have to share it with me.
[8277.66 → 8278.38] And they're like,
[8278.50 → 8278.62] no,
[8278.64 → 8279.24] that's not a problem.
[8279.58 → 8279.92] I'm like,
[8280.02 → 8280.18] look,
[8280.24 → 8281.44] we're not doing anything wrong.
[8281.52 → 8281.78] I'm like,
[8281.80 → 8282.72] I didn't say you were,
[8282.86 → 8284.28] I didn't say you were favouring it.
[8284.44 → 8284.94] I said,
[8285.00 → 8286.04] it's a conflict of interest.
[8286.08 → 8286.32] I said,
[8286.36 → 8289.12] you guys are financially incentivized to favour it.
[8289.18 → 8290.88] And basically that was the end of the conversation.
[8291.58 → 8291.94] Um,
[8292.58 → 8293.50] so this is another,
[8293.76 → 8296.34] this is another clear example.
[8296.56 → 8301.64] If Google were to monetize video that's being uploaded to the platform in this way,
[8301.64 → 8307.60] this is another example of something that I would have once upon a time assumed,
[8307.66 → 8309.48] that they would share with their creator community.
[8309.64 → 8311.90] And nowadays, I don't believe that they would.
[8318.22 → 8318.66] Yeah.
[8320.82 → 8321.26] Um,
[8321.26 → 8324.72] I don't know.
[8324.84 → 8325.80] This whole thing's going to suck.
[8325.98 → 8326.26] Someone,
[8326.42 → 8327.76] I think tweeted it or something.
[8327.98 → 8329.10] There was a
[8329.10 → 8329.86] uh,
[8329.96 → 8332.60] Bing chat response that they got to a question.
[8332.72 → 8333.04] No,
[8333.08 → 8333.50] it was on Reddit.
[8333.50 → 8336.06] I think a Bing chat response that they got to a question,
[8336.14 → 8337.46] which cited the LCT forum.
[8339.90 → 8340.34] Nice.
[8342.42 → 8342.86] Thanks.
[8343.44 → 8343.92] Open AI.
[8344.06 → 8344.36] Good info on there.
[8344.98 → 8345.22] Yeah.
[8345.36 → 8345.62] Yeah,
[8345.86 → 8346.44] exactly.
[8347.26 → 8347.56] Sweet.
[8347.98 → 8349.98] macOS Sequoia asked for permission.
[8350.50 → 8351.22] A lot.
[8351.78 → 8354.26] Apple has been trying to step up security on the Mac in recent years,
[8354.34 → 8358.50] making it more awkward to run apps that require certain permissions or apps from non,
[8358.50 → 8359.06] non,
[8359.06 → 8360.32] uh,
[8360.36 → 8363.14] app store sources with Sequoia.
[8363.22 → 8370.02] Apple will remove the ability to control click to override gatekeeper when opening unsigned or non-notarized apps,
[8370.02 → 8378.22] apps that are granted access to features like screen recording or location tracking will also now require the user to continue to allow the access on a weekly basis,
[8378.22 → 8381.10] as well as after every system restart.
[8381.10 → 8383.66] Apple has not commented publicly,
[8383.94 → 8388.20] but apparently has confirmed to multiple developers that this is not a bug.
[8388.86 → 8389.04] Uh,
[8389.04 → 8392.74] some articles suggest that this could be a domestic abuse prevention measure,
[8393.22 → 8396.38] while others liken it to Windows Vista's UAC prompts,
[8396.50 → 8398.92] calling it a subscription you didn't buy,
[8399.10 → 8400.34] but can't cancel.
[8400.76 → 8408.52] Our discussion question is where do you draw the line between keeping users safe while staying out of the way of power users that don't want you to nanny them?
[8408.52 → 8408.88] Um,
[8410.98 → 8413.16] I don't have answers here.
[8413.64 → 8414.04] Yeah.
[8414.56 → 8415.66] The problem is that,
[8415.76 → 8415.94] okay,
[8416.04 → 8416.28] you know,
[8416.32 → 8417.94] back to the domestic abuse argument,
[8418.08 → 8418.28] you know,
[8418.34 → 8419.26] if a spouse is,
[8419.30 → 8419.58] you know,
[8419.76 → 8421.30] screen sharing or,
[8421.30 → 8422.00] uh,
[8422.00 → 8423.36] screen recording everything you do,
[8423.40 → 8423.88] should you,
[8424.02 → 8426.20] should you find that out if you're not tech-savvy?
[8426.84 → 8427.24] Uh,
[8427.68 → 8429.00] I don't know the right answers here,
[8429.02 → 8432.48] but I do know that I would find those prompts annoying, and I would want to get them to go away.
[8432.92 → 8434.76] I think there are other ways to deal with that.
[8435.24 → 8435.92] Like a
[8435.98 → 8438.34] a like computer use awareness,
[8438.52 → 8439.92] little like notification.
[8441.20 → 8441.60] Um,
[8442.60 → 8444.06] it could be like,
[8444.26 → 8445.18] I don't know.
[8445.42 → 8447.58] I think that's not too difficult of a thing to do.
[8447.94 → 8449.54] I could like to do a pop-up once a week.
[8449.54 → 8449.70] Like,
[8449.80 → 8452.90] did you know that your screen is like constantly being recorded?
[8453.06 → 8456.10] This is like not normal activity for most users.
[8456.10 → 8460.06] We're just making sure that you're aware because there could be like issues with this.
[8460.06 → 8461.24] Something like that would be fine.
[8461.24 → 8461.68] Um,
[8461.68 → 8465.26] easy things just get okayed.
[8465.56 → 8465.74] Yeah.
[8465.82 → 8467.06] But super annoying,
[8467.26 → 8469.58] constant password prompts result in terrible,
[8469.80 → 8471.20] easy to crack passwords.
[8471.20 → 8471.62] Like that,
[8471.68 → 8473.28] that that's not a solution either.
[8473.42 → 8473.52] Yeah.
[8473.60 → 8474.54] G free co one says,
[8474.60 → 8476.02] this is going to end up just like cookies.
[8476.02 → 8477.40] You'll click the button and not read it.
[8477.60 → 8478.00] Yep.
[8478.18 → 8478.34] Yeah.
[8478.34 → 8478.82] A hundred percent.
[8479.06 → 8479.42] Exactly.
[8479.74 → 8480.34] Like it's,
[8480.98 → 8481.86] um,
[8482.30 → 8483.30] that's why I'm saying like,
[8483.36 → 8485.00] try to bundle it into like a warning,
[8485.18 → 8486.04] like a non,
[8486.10 → 8488.12] non-standard usage warning of some form.
[8489.44 → 8490.72] After 33 years,
[8490.86 → 8494.12] the longest running U S gaming magazine is gone.
[8494.52 → 8495.74] Rip game informer.
[8495.82 → 8496.08] You did.
[8496.18 → 8496.32] Oh,
[8496.42 → 8496.74] all right,
[8496.74 → 8496.92] cool.
[8497.20 → 8497.36] Yep.
[8497.50 → 8498.02] All right.
[8498.02 → 8499.16] Let's do some merch messages.
[8499.34 → 8501.20] And then I kind of actually need to go.
[8501.88 → 8502.38] Got them.
[8502.44 → 8502.68] Okay.
[8502.68 → 8507.00] Hit me,
[8507.06 → 8507.24] Dan.
[8510.00 → 8510.72] Is Dan there?
[8511.16 → 8511.80] Dan's not there.
[8512.54 → 8512.94] Oh,
[8513.42 → 8516.42] I guess I'll,
[8516.42 → 8517.54] I'll read some merch messages.
[8517.76 → 8517.80] Uh,
[8517.80 → 8518.94] Tristan says,
[8519.02 → 8522.24] am I the only one who's really impressed by Zen five thoughts?
[8522.36 → 8522.80] Luke Linus,
[8522.86 → 8523.08] Dan.
[8523.58 → 8523.98] Yes.
[8523.98 → 8525.80] It's only a marginal performance improvement,
[8525.80 → 8529.18] but at 30 to 40% less power in a lower MSRP.
[8529.46 → 8529.80] Hey,
[8529.94 → 8530.82] PRO exists.
[8531.38 → 8531.92] Tech community,
[8531.92 → 8533.72] tech community seems cold on them.
[8534.24 → 8534.56] I mean,
[8534.66 → 8537.14] I think we made our position really clear in our review.
[8537.28 → 8540.22] We were quite positive on Zen five.
[8540.68 → 8545.20] We acknowledge that it's not for everything, and it's not for everyone.
[8545.80 → 8546.02] Um,
[8546.12 → 8553.00] I am super not stoked on the fact that AMD didn't give it a higher power target out of the box.
[8553.00 → 8560.14] And the fact that I have to void my warranty in order to see the generational uplift that is absolutely there.
[8560.14 → 8562.52] If it was unlocked from the factory,
[8562.52 → 8570.34] but it's also not the first time that we've seen this kind of very conservative power management from AMD.
[8570.34 → 8574.96] We've seen it before with their 5,000 series and 7,000 series X3D chips.
[8574.96 → 8581.16] So maybe this amount of power is just what's safe for Ry zen 9000.
[8581.16 → 8583.12] And that's just what we're going to have to live with.
[8583.24 → 8583.84] But overall,
[8584.00 → 8591.28] I think a big part of the tech community's frigidness is based on the tech community's perspective of,
[8591.28 → 8595.74] is this a great upgrade for my processor that's the latest and greatest today?
[8596.24 → 8597.66] That world is over,
[8597.78 → 8598.24] you guys.
[8598.92 → 8599.58] Like that's,
[8599.66 → 8600.82] that's dead.
[8601.00 → 8604.32] Upgrading every generation is just not a thing anymore.
[8604.58 → 8609.28] So what we're comparing against is if it's time to buy a new computer right now,
[8609.44 → 8611.66] how does it compete in the market?
[8612.12 → 8613.68] And the answer is really well.
[8613.92 → 8616.22] I figured out where that notification sound is coming from.
[8616.26 → 8617.46] It's coming from my watch.
[8617.46 → 8619.36] Sorry,
[8619.48 → 8621.74] you guys kept telling me to mute my notifications.
[8621.92 → 8622.22] I was like,
[8622.24 → 8622.38] Oh,
[8622.44 → 8622.98] I did.
[8623.54 → 8623.86] I am.
[8624.46 → 8625.64] That's why it was so loud.
[8625.64 → 8626.72] Because it was right next to the mic.
[8626.96 → 8627.00] Yeah.
[8627.00 → 8627.98] I'm not used to,
[8628.08 → 8628.40] uh,
[8628.62 → 8630.44] I'm not used to wearing a smartwatch anymore.
[8630.84 → 8632.12] I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[8632.20 → 8635.24] I do not actually know how to adjust the volume on this.
[8635.82 → 8636.96] I figured it out.
[8637.12 → 8637.48] Yay.
[8637.48 → 8640.12] Being a tech influencer or whatever.
[8640.22 → 8640.44] All right,
[8640.48 → 8640.68] cool.
[8641.34 → 8642.46] Sorry about that.
[8642.56 → 8643.14] Open a ticket.
[8644.18 → 8644.58] Um,
[8645.50 → 8646.20] all right,
[8646.32 → 8647.18] Dan,
[8647.18 → 8648.48] you want to hit us with submerged messages?
[8648.80 → 8648.98] Yeah,
[8649.00 → 8649.32] sure.
[8649.38 → 8650.30] I've got a bunch here.
[8650.38 → 8650.96] Let's see.
[8651.60 → 8652.08] Um,
[8652.46 → 8659.08] do contaminant monitoring products exist for water loops that could have alerted you before yours failed?
[8659.28 → 8663.36] I work with tech that could easily be pivoted to that use case.
[8663.36 → 8664.54] If there's a market for it,
[8664.54 → 8666.16] I'm sure it does exist,
[8666.30 → 8671.24] but certainly not at the kind of cost that I would want to pay for my Jacky,
[8671.36 → 8673.64] stupid dump heat into my pool,
[8673.80 → 8674.12] uh,
[8674.12 → 8674.98] water cooling loop.
[8674.98 → 8676.70] I've got some,
[8676.80 → 8678.50] I've got some plans for the longer term,
[8678.60 → 8679.12] but that's,
[8679.20 → 8679.56] uh,
[8679.98 → 8680.18] yeah,
[8680.28 → 8686.50] super cool technology and probably not applicable outside of like real data centres and supercomputers
[8686.50 → 8686.90] and stuff.
[8687.98 → 8688.40] Sorry,
[8688.50 → 8689.78] Chad seems to have missed.
[8690.14 → 8691.54] What did I miss when I was away?
[8693.20 → 8693.60] No,
[8693.68 → 8694.08] you're fine.
[8694.28 → 8694.54] Okay,
[8694.72 → 8694.92] cool.
[8694.92 → 8695.42] Uh,
[8695.74 → 8695.98] Luke,
[8696.18 → 8700.02] it seems like you pump the brakes when discussing web technologies.
[8700.02 → 8702.98] I would love to see more segments related to your expertise,
[8703.24 → 8703.58] insights,
[8703.58 → 8704.32] and opinions.
[8706.12 → 8707.40] How do I pump the brakes?
[8708.54 → 8709.44] I don't know.
[8710.58 → 8711.02] Uh,
[8711.06 → 8711.20] you,
[8711.26 → 8712.74] you press down on them a few times.
[8714.72 → 8715.22] Thanks,
[8715.30 → 8715.54] Linus.
[8715.92 → 8718.64] You should probably have them bled if they're spongy like that.
[8718.64 → 8719.64] I,
[8721.64 → 8721.90] yeah,
[8721.96 → 8723.62] I don't think most of the audience really cares.
[8723.96 → 8724.32] Um,
[8724.32 → 8728.92] I think I address it at a level that gets the point across,
[8728.92 → 8731.40] but doesn't result in me talking about it for freaking ever.
[8731.40 → 8733.40] We're not like a web developer creator.
[8734.54 → 8735.02] Um,
[8735.24 → 8737.36] I'm at DEFCON right now hanging out with a few of them,
[8737.56 → 8739.06] but that's not really what we do.
[8739.72 → 8740.08] Uh,
[8740.16 → 8740.82] so honestly,
[8740.82 → 8742.04] if you want content on that,
[8742.14 → 8746.96] you're probably better off just viewing someone else's.
[8746.96 → 8747.64] Uh,
[8747.64 → 8748.14] but I don't,
[8748.20 → 8750.96] I don't mind like trying to answer the questions that do come through.
[8751.08 → 8752.06] That also being said,
[8752.08 → 8753.42] I'm not a developer these days.
[8753.66 → 8754.04] Um,
[8754.06 → 8755.84] I manage developers, and I'm in the space,
[8755.84 → 8756.36] but like,
[8756.68 → 8757.80] yeah,
[8757.90 → 8758.38] I don't know.
[8758.80 → 8759.62] I do what I can.
[8760.22 → 8761.18] And I do what makes sense.
[8762.56 → 8763.00] Hi,
[8763.14 → 8764.24] first time merch messenger,
[8764.76 → 8766.94] a passion project I've had in mind,
[8767.20 → 8771.84] build a computer with the longest possible lifespan around 300 years.
[8771.90 → 8772.10] Maybe.
[8772.28 → 8773.86] How would you go about this hardware,
[8774.04 → 8774.32] software,
[8774.48 → 8775.80] custom video topic?
[8776.96 → 8780.00] You wouldn't.
[8780.86 → 8781.34] Um,
[8781.84 → 8785.54] you might be able to find data storage that would last that long.
[8785.62 → 8790.40] I think M disk has a lifespan in the neighbourhood of hundreds or thousands of years.
[8790.66 → 8791.12] Um,
[8791.28 → 8800.26] but every element of a modern computer is going to significantly decay across that kind of period of time.
[8800.26 → 8800.82] I'm sorry.
[8805.32 → 8805.76] Hello,
[8805.96 → 8813.78] Dan Luke and tech slim shady having both dyslexia and ADHD and had an ex tell me it annoyed her.
[8813.78 → 8818.22] Any advice on dealing with your ADHD and dyslexia in your relationship and professional life?
[8818.90 → 8820.48] Find someone who likes you for you.
[8822.86 → 8823.92] Be apologetic.
[8824.32 → 8824.66] Own it.
[8824.84 → 8825.30] Be upfront.
[8825.84 → 8826.12] Um,
[8826.12 → 8827.26] don't use it as an excuse.
[8828.48 → 8828.88] Um,
[8828.88 → 8830.30] all three of those.
[8830.84 → 8831.24] Yeah.
[8832.68 → 8833.22] Try to,
[8833.28 → 8834.76] try to find ways to,
[8834.96 → 8835.82] I mean,
[8835.82 → 8837.36] there are benefits to,
[8837.46 → 8837.72] I mean,
[8837.72 → 8837.94] not,
[8838.02 → 8839.00] not to dyslexia,
[8839.08 → 8839.38] but there,
[8839.54 → 8841.24] there are benefits to things like ADHD.
[8841.24 → 8843.36] You get that hyper focus going on and stuff like that.
[8843.92 → 8844.36] Um,
[8844.36 → 8847.46] so make yourself hyper useful when you can.
[8847.66 → 8849.90] And then when it's not working out great,
[8850.66 → 8851.50] then it's not going to upgrade.
[8851.68 → 8851.98] I don't know.
[8852.26 → 8853.08] I'm right down everything.
[8854.66 → 8855.06] Yes.
[8855.30 → 8856.26] To the best of your ability.
[8857.10 → 8857.32] Yep.
[8857.86 → 8859.30] This is technically after dark,
[8859.36 → 8859.56] right?
[8860.92 → 8861.28] Yeah.
[8862.00 → 8862.32] Yeah.
[8862.36 → 8862.94] Sorry about that.
[8863.30 → 8863.44] No,
[8863.46 → 8863.82] that's all good.
[8864.44 → 8865.48] I had to push the buttons.
[8866.52 → 8866.92] Okay.
[8866.98 → 8867.68] Let's see.
[8867.96 → 8870.26] Just started college this week at 37.
[8870.62 → 8871.16] Wish me luck.
[8871.78 → 8872.34] Luke and Linus,
[8872.34 → 8873.86] if LTT hadn't taken off,
[8873.86 → 8876.34] would you guys have wanted to go back or finish college?
[8876.52 → 8877.44] What would you have majored in?
[8878.72 → 8883.50] I would have needed to see someone require the degree for something that I
[8883.50 → 8883.88] really,
[8883.96 → 8884.10] really,
[8884.16 → 8884.90] really wanted to do.
[8885.18 → 8886.96] There was no way I was going to go back just for Lulu.
[8892.40 → 8892.76] Hmm.
[8896.46 → 8898.44] I feel like I still probably would have done software engineering,
[8898.92 → 8901.12] but realistically,
[8901.12 → 8903.92] if it,
[8903.96 → 8904.70] if it was now,
[8904.78 → 8905.76] I wouldn't be going that route.
[8906.10 → 8907.16] Not because like,
[8907.40 → 8908.66] I feel like people are going to spin that.
[8908.82 → 8909.60] Not because like,
[8909.66 → 8909.88] Oh,
[8910.00 → 8912.40] AI are going to take the jobs or anything like that.
[8913.46 → 8913.82] Just,
[8913.94 → 8914.10] I've,
[8914.10 → 8916.16] I've kind of started doing other things now.
[8916.22 → 8919.00] It's been a long time since I made my decision to go to university.
[8919.00 → 8921.12] I respect the decision I did make at the time,
[8921.12 → 8923.78] but it's not the same one that I would make now where I'm at in my life
[8923.78 → 8924.14] currently.
[8924.72 → 8925.28] So it's what it is.
[8928.28 → 8928.72] Hello,
[8929.06 → 8929.68] WAN people.
[8929.96 → 8933.44] I just found out that our two blazers run window seven while on the
[8933.44 → 8935.34] network with a port open for service.
[8935.46 → 8938.04] Not to mention that we have confidential part files.
[8938.30 → 8939.00] Thoughts.
[8939.00 → 8941.98] You and everyone.
[8941.98 → 8943.12] I mean,
[8943.76 → 8944.98] obsolete software.
[8945.52 → 8945.66] Oh,
[8945.74 → 8945.96] sorry.
[8946.00 → 8946.32] Like muted.
[8946.92 → 8948.20] You and everyone.
[8948.36 → 8948.54] I mean,
[8948.62 → 8955.82] obsolete software is a reality in the daily lives of so many technology workers
[8955.82 → 8956.98] and administrators.
[8959.98 → 8961.26] Try to do better.
[8962.30 → 8963.20] Good luck,
[8963.28 → 8963.66] everybody.
[8963.66 → 8964.66] Yeah.
[8966.82 → 8969.22] I feel like we're headed into kind of dark age,
[8969.26 → 8969.48] right?
[8970.12 → 8973.62] Because for things like old nuclear reactors or like,
[8974.14 → 8974.82] um,
[8976.30 → 8976.74] you know,
[8976.86 → 8977.12] old,
[8977.26 → 8979.84] ancient machine shops or like,
[8979.88 → 8980.70] like a lot of really,
[8980.76 → 8984.74] a lot of obsolete Windows 95 and Windows 98 stuff is like,
[8984.80 → 8986.44] it's bad or whatever,
[8987.34 → 8988.22] but it can,
[8988.38 → 8989.62] it can be not on the network.
[8989.78 → 8991.64] So it's not that bad.
[8991.64 → 9000.14] Whereas we're headed into the Vista and windows seven running machines of the
[9000.14 → 9000.56] world,
[9000.56 → 9001.76] um,
[9002.22 → 9008.16] being obsolete and probably way more connected and therefore potentially a
[9008.16 → 9009.30] worse attack vector.
[9009.52 → 9010.24] Uh,
[9010.26 → 9014.66] I think we're headed into a very dangerous period as far as like outdated it
[9014.66 → 9017.56] infrastructure and security goes.
[9017.56 → 9023.82] Love the podcast gives me something to listen to while I drive semi trucks.
[9024.24 → 9026.18] When is the next Noctua collab?
[9026.98 → 9027.38] I don't know.
[9027.62 → 9027.86] Um,
[9027.86 → 9028.90] we're not going to force anything,
[9029.16 → 9029.38] right?
[9029.54 → 9030.30] Screwdriver was cool.
[9030.64 → 9031.16] Uh,
[9031.18 → 9032.92] we made some Brown screwdrivers and that was cool,
[9033.02 → 9033.38] but I,
[9033.48 → 9035.96] I don't think there's anything on the docket right now.
[9038.16 → 9038.64] Hi,
[9038.72 → 9039.04] DLL.
[9039.30 → 9042.50] I'm a big fan of the adult Lego sets like Pac-Man,
[9042.60 → 9042.96] Nintendo,
[9042.96 → 9043.82] and Atari.
[9044.34 → 9046.58] What Lego set would you buy instantly?
[9046.58 → 9047.48] Should it come out?
[9047.76 → 9048.86] Greetings from the Netherlands.
[9049.34 → 9050.06] Oh my goodness.
[9050.98 → 9051.46] Um,
[9051.52 → 9052.28] Lego is really expensive.
[9053.04 → 9055.02] Someone gave proof.
[9055.20 → 9056.62] I forget who this is.
[9056.92 → 9057.30] Uh,
[9057.32 → 9058.66] but a viewer,
[9058.84 → 9060.38] I believe give proof,
[9060.46 → 9062.12] um,
[9062.22 → 9064.28] a Lego set or like a
[9064.28 → 9067.50] like a Lego diorama of our set,
[9067.74 → 9069.94] like the build corner set.
[9069.94 → 9072.42] And it is so cool.
[9072.42 → 9073.68] Like the ideas they had,
[9073.70 → 9073.84] they,
[9073.96 → 9083.92] they did everything from like the LED strips at the bottom of the little cages to the little arm that sits on that our camera guys use to hold the camera.
[9084.00 → 9084.30] Like it,
[9084.38 → 9084.58] Oh,
[9084.66 → 9086.42] it is so cool.
[9086.78 → 9087.58] I would buy it.
[9087.58 → 9087.82] Awesome.
[9088.08 → 9088.72] I would buy it.
[9088.76 → 9089.50] I would want one.
[9090.70 → 9092.32] LTT Lego collab.
[9092.58 → 9093.06] Goodbye.
[9093.16 → 9093.76] The whole building.
[9093.84 → 9094.28] That'd be neat.
[9094.50 → 9095.26] That'd be so cool.
[9096.60 → 9097.26] Let's see.
[9097.26 → 9097.92] Linus,
[9097.98 → 9101.60] what are your thoughts on SMITE 2110?
[9102.18 → 9104.86] The uncompressed video over IP standard.
[9105.46 → 9109.14] Do you see any advantage to be able to record directly to a NAS?
[9109.96 → 9110.34] Uh,
[9110.42 → 9110.68] Oh,
[9110.76 → 9111.04] wait,
[9111.10 → 9112.56] is this what we use for short circuit?
[9113.12 → 9115.18] Because I don't think they record to SD cards.
[9115.54 → 9117.80] I don't think so.
[9118.96 → 9119.44] I don't know.
[9119.58 → 9121.64] But if this allows you to,
[9121.80 → 9122.32] I've never,
[9122.32 → 9123.58] I've never heard this term before,
[9123.58 → 9124.54] at least not that I remember,
[9124.54 → 9131.80] but if it allows you to record on a camera and then just stream out of an Ethernet cable to a NAS or something like that,
[9131.86 → 9132.70] then I love it.
[9132.82 → 9133.14] Um,
[9133.48 → 9134.36] and I think we,
[9134.74 → 9136.76] it being uncompressed though,
[9136.84 → 9138.04] being uncompressed seems weird.
[9138.08 → 9139.42] Why would you even want it to be?
[9139.86 → 9140.24] Okay.
[9140.32 → 9141.92] There are reasons to want it to be uncompressed,
[9141.98 → 9142.32] but I could,
[9142.40 → 9143.56] I wouldn't see us doing that.
[9143.62 → 9146.24] I don't see why we'd want completely uncompressed video.
[9146.24 → 9147.12] Uh,
[9147.16 → 9148.94] that sounds super cool.
[9149.34 → 9149.74] Um,
[9149.78 → 9152.50] but I think I'd be okay with some compression.
[9153.40 → 9156.78] ADI is absolutely nowhere near uncompressed.
[9158.06 → 9158.46] Uh,
[9158.46 → 9158.70] sorry.
[9158.82 → 9160.76] Nine exists in a flow plane chat.
[9160.88 → 9161.00] Yeah.
[9161.06 → 9161.42] And there's,
[9161.50 → 9162.62] there's stuff other than ADI.
[9162.78 → 9164.90] ADI is not the only option for,
[9164.90 → 9165.42] uh,
[9165.48 → 9166.40] video delivery over,
[9166.58 → 9167.34] over a local network.
[9168.92 → 9169.40] Yeah.
[9169.40 → 9173.98] I think we found some stuff with labs that was absolutely not going to be good for it.
[9174.78 → 9175.04] Okay.
[9175.06 → 9175.42] Let's see.
[9175.60 → 9176.04] Hey,
[9176.14 → 9176.48] Linus,
[9176.54 → 9177.16] with all the Mr.
[9177.28 → 9178.94] Beast allegations going on,
[9178.98 → 9179.66] I was wondering,
[9179.92 → 9181.72] were you invited to the big YouTuber video?
[9181.84 → 9182.28] If so,
[9182.38 → 9183.84] why did you not go?
[9184.66 → 9185.04] Um,
[9185.74 → 9186.14] I,
[9186.82 → 9189.56] I don't think Jimmy's ever invited me to be in a video.
[9190.40 → 9190.80] Um,
[9191.72 → 9192.52] I don't know.
[9192.62 → 9192.72] I,
[9192.80 → 9193.42] it's weird.
[9193.52 → 9196.62] I feel like even though I'm West coast,
[9196.80 → 9197.40] so I'm,
[9197.48 → 9199.38] I'm like a two and a half hour flight from LA.
[9200.22 → 9200.62] Um,
[9200.86 → 9206.44] whether I just haven't made the right social connections or people like other creators know
[9206.44 → 9207.18] who we are.
[9207.54 → 9212.88] Like Luke talked about this years ago where he went to Twitch con for the first time and
[9212.88 → 9217.94] like thought fans were going to approach him, and they totally had no idea who he was,
[9217.94 → 9223.34] but Twitch creators would be like being mobbed by people, and they'd see him and be like,
[9223.40 → 9223.56] sorry,
[9223.62 → 9224.02] excuse me.
[9224.06 → 9226.00] I got to go and like to go to Luke.
[9226.42 → 9227.64] People know who we are.
[9227.64 → 9227.92] Cool,
[9228.00 → 9229.66] but very surprising experience.
[9230.86 → 9231.46] But I,
[9231.46 → 9234.30] I feel like they don't really think of us as like,
[9234.30 → 9237.08] I don't know.
[9237.16 → 9237.36] Like,
[9237.42 → 9238.04] I don't know.
[9238.06 → 9239.40] It's like I'm tech dad or something.
[9239.40 → 9240.10] Like I'm not,
[9240.20 → 9241.36] I don't think I'm,
[9241.36 → 9243.46] you know,
[9243.46 → 9247.30] you're not super social when it comes to creators.
[9249.42 → 9250.64] Like you don't really go to,
[9250.74 → 9251.88] like you don't like going to events.
[9253.42 → 9254.50] I guess that's true.
[9254.82 → 9255.18] Sorry.
[9255.32 → 9255.88] I know Mr.
[9255.96 → 9257.20] Beast is East coast guys.
[9257.42 → 9259.82] I'm saying like a lot of collabs happen in LA.
[9259.92 → 9261.06] LA is like the hotspot.
[9261.24 → 9261.40] Yeah.
[9261.40 → 9262.08] Um,
[9262.14 → 9264.58] I wasn't specifically talking about Jimmy there.
[9264.70 → 9265.44] I just meant like,
[9265.50 → 9267.70] I don't really get asked to collab on anything.
[9268.20 → 9268.64] Um,
[9268.68 → 9269.92] like Ludwig has,
[9270.12 → 9271.46] has collabed with us,
[9271.52 → 9272.20] but I feel like,
[9272.20 → 9272.90] uh,
[9272.90 → 9273.34] he really,
[9273.44 → 9274.90] he was really the one who drove that.
[9275.00 → 9276.18] I can't really take any,
[9276.26 → 9277.16] any credit for it.
[9278.06 → 9278.46] Um,
[9278.76 → 9280.04] like he called me recently.
[9280.04 → 9280.62] He was,
[9280.74 → 9282.62] he had people give him advice on his birthday.
[9282.62 → 9286.42] I think I ended up giving a tier advice.
[9287.02 → 9288.00] Know how I did it.
[9289.04 → 9291.92] I was at a badminton gym, and they just had like some books,
[9291.92 → 9292.50] like,
[9292.58 → 9293.82] like motivational books.
[9293.96 → 9297.86] And I just like to read the titles off the spines of like motivational books.
[9298.10 → 9298.76] And he was like,
[9298.80 → 9298.92] Hmm,
[9298.92 → 9299.52] that's pretty good.
[9299.54 → 9300.14] That's pretty good.
[9300.16 → 9302.94] And then I like flipped my camera over, and I showed him that I was just
[9302.94 → 9304.20] reading off of something.
[9304.50 → 9305.22] It's pretty good.
[9306.28 → 9306.64] That's,
[9306.76 → 9307.56] that's pretty great.
[9307.80 → 9308.66] I enjoyed it.
[9308.66 → 9309.10] I think,
[9309.30 → 9310.80] I think part of it is a
[9310.80 → 9311.76] uh,
[9311.76 → 9316.26] weird people over a border in the corner situation where people would have
[9316.26 → 9316.40] to,
[9316.50 → 9316.96] I mean,
[9317.06 → 9320.30] America is so huge and there are so many things to do.
[9320.40 → 9322.26] A lot of Americans don't even have passports.
[9322.44 → 9326.08] I know create American YouTube creators that don't have passports.
[9326.08 → 9327.70] Like they're not going to be coming up to Canada.
[9328.32 → 9328.80] Um,
[9329.80 → 9330.34] it's,
[9330.60 → 9333.60] it's,
[9333.64 → 9338.10] it's not convenient when you can like to drive down the street for 10 minutes
[9338.10 → 9341.74] and have as many other collabs as we can.
[9341.76 → 9342.26] Um,
[9342.26 → 9343.46] in,
[9343.56 → 9345.08] in a few different areas in the States,
[9345.08 → 9345.70] like New York,
[9345.82 → 9346.08] Texas,
[9346.22 → 9346.46] LA.
[9347.22 → 9347.62] Um,
[9347.86 → 9350.52] and on top of that,
[9350.60 → 9352.08] you don't like going to events.
[9352.64 → 9353.04] Um,
[9353.36 → 9354.32] and I think when you do,
[9354.40 → 9357.18] you probably don't do a ton of the socially things.
[9357.24 → 9358.24] I don't think you go to the parties,
[9358.38 → 9358.96] things like that.
[9360.26 → 9360.70] So,
[9360.70 → 9363.48] not in the
[9363.48 → 9368.68] not in the mind space and then difficult because far and over a border and
[9368.68 → 9369.26] everything else.
[9369.58 → 9370.34] Out of sight,
[9370.40 → 9370.80] out of mind.
[9371.16 → 9371.62] Tech dad.
[9371.70 → 9371.88] Yeah.
[9372.22 → 9372.46] No,
[9372.54 → 9373.76] I like the tech dad angle.
[9376.28 → 9376.60] Yeah.
[9376.60 → 9376.76] Okay.
[9376.76 → 9377.14] Let's see.
[9377.16 → 9378.26] I've got a couple more for you here.
[9378.70 → 9378.90] Hi,
[9379.02 → 9379.44] LLD.
[9379.64 → 9382.44] I'm a young adult with his first serious partner.
[9383.14 → 9387.20] Lion has talked about a don't go to sleep angry rule in the past.
[9387.32 → 9388.14] Where did it come from?
[9388.34 → 9391.56] I instead find that resting helps to solve conflicts.
[9392.38 → 9393.70] It's not meant to be literal.
[9393.94 → 9396.76] What it means is don't leave things unresolved.
[9397.70 → 9398.26] So like,
[9398.36 → 9402.24] don't go to sleep angry means it means don't walk away in a huff.
[9402.56 → 9403.76] It means don't,
[9404.38 → 9404.80] um,
[9405.10 → 9408.42] don't just leave something and let it fester.
[9408.84 → 9410.22] It means talk it out,
[9410.56 → 9411.48] work through it,
[9411.62 → 9414.88] work together as opposed to just letting things,
[9415.26 → 9416.02] letting conflicts,
[9416.22 → 9419.10] letting disagreements pile up over time until they explode.
[9421.56 → 9425.24] And last one I got for you here.
[9425.70 → 9425.94] Hey,
[9426.08 → 9427.52] DLL question for Linus.
[9427.84 → 9429.18] Cross code devs,
[9429.24 → 9429.68] new game,
[9429.84 → 9431.62] Alabaster Dawn got announced.
[9431.94 → 9432.82] Radical fish news.
[9433.32 → 9434.42] Looks really neat.
[9434.60 → 9436.14] Any thoughts or hopes for the games?
[9437.08 → 9437.40] Well,
[9437.54 → 9437.82] I,
[9437.92 → 9438.24] um,
[9438.30 → 9438.86] didn't know.
[9438.86 → 9440.58] You're hearing it for the first time.
[9440.66 → 9440.76] Yeah.
[9441.14 → 9441.34] Yeah.
[9441.42 → 9443.24] The creators of cross code.
[9446.20 → 9446.68] Hmm.
[9447.54 → 9451.54] Break Nick's curse and guide humanity's rebirth in the
[9451.54 → 9455.40] top down two and a half D action RPG from the creators of
[9455.40 → 9455.92] cross code.
[9455.98 → 9458.44] I can already see some similarities.
[9459.38 → 9459.62] Oh yeah.
[9459.62 → 9460.68] There's no way I don't buy it,
[9460.74 → 9460.96] but,
[9461.02 → 9461.42] um,
[9461.52 → 9461.72] yeah.
[9462.72 → 9464.86] Planned release date to be announced,
[9465.24 → 9466.18] uh,
[9466.18 → 9467.54] solve intriguing puzzles,
[9467.82 → 9469.22] explore a changing world.
[9470.10 → 9470.60] Okay.
[9470.64 → 9475.94] This looks very closely related gameplay wise to cross code.
[9475.94 → 9476.38] So,
[9476.38 → 9477.60] um,
[9477.60 → 9478.16] really it's,
[9478.26 → 9478.52] you know,
[9478.62 → 9478.96] it's,
[9479.04 → 9482.86] I'm not expecting to get a really different gaming experience out of
[9482.86 → 9483.02] it,
[9483.02 → 9483.34] but,
[9483.42 → 9484.14] uh,
[9484.14 → 9485.30] what I am expecting,
[9485.30 → 9485.80] I,
[9485.88 → 9487.02] I really like the
[9487.14 → 9487.32] uh,
[9487.32 → 9489.72] I like the way they've changed the art style a little bit to make it
[9489.72 → 9490.46] more clear.
[9490.92 → 9492.98] What level things are on it.
[9493.12 → 9493.24] The
[9493.24 → 9497.86] the world looks a little bit more two and a half dimensional here,
[9497.86 → 9499.94] which is going to really help with puzzle solving,
[9499.94 → 9500.98] I think in some cases.
[9501.28 → 9501.72] Uh,
[9501.72 → 9502.14] but for me,
[9502.14 → 9503.22] it's going to come down to the story.
[9503.22 → 9503.88] Um,
[9504.16 → 9504.64] like that's,
[9504.70 → 9505.66] I love the characters.
[9505.80 → 9507.64] I love the story that they created with cross code.
[9508.10 → 9512.48] So as long as they have taken the time and care to,
[9512.48 → 9512.92] you know,
[9512.94 → 9514.32] write a great story for this,
[9514.38 → 9514.76] then I'm,
[9514.76 → 9515.30] I'm stoked.
[9517.40 → 9517.72] Yeah.
[9518.50 → 9519.24] If you're excited,
[9519.34 → 9520.26] don't forget to wishlist.
[9520.40 → 9520.94] It's very important.
[9521.06 → 9521.36] Can't wait.
[9521.42 → 9521.54] Oh,
[9521.56 → 9523.00] I'm not going to need to remember that.
[9523.48 → 9523.58] No,
[9523.60 → 9523.68] no,
[9523.68 → 9524.64] it's good for the devs.
[9524.74 → 9525.10] Oh,
[9525.24 → 9525.98] yeah.
[9526.86 → 9527.18] Oh,
[9527.18 → 9527.56] I see.
[9527.94 → 9528.14] Well,
[9528.16 → 9528.96] I'm not signed in here.
[9529.02 → 9529.12] Oh,
[9529.14 → 9529.74] I am signed in.
[9529.82 → 9529.94] Oh,
[9529.96 → 9530.28] look at that.
[9530.36 → 9530.58] All right.
[9530.58 → 9530.74] Sure.
[9530.86 → 9531.04] Fine.
[9531.60 → 9532.08] Cool.
[9532.08 → 9533.30] Add it to my wishlist.
[9533.42 → 9533.74] Let's go.
[9534.48 → 9535.08] Very good.
[9536.16 → 9536.60] All right.
[9536.68 → 9537.00] Linus.
[9538.06 → 9538.66] I'm happy.
[9539.16 → 9541.04] I'm happy you're signed in on that laptop.
[9541.48 → 9542.12] That's a good thing.
[9542.32 → 9542.48] Oh,
[9542.94 → 9543.90] I'm signing to steam.
[9543.90 → 9544.98] I hope your steam account gets compromised.
[9545.40 → 9546.06] I'm signing to steam.
[9546.06 → 9546.54] Who cares?
[9546.56 → 9546.80] Luke,
[9546.80 → 9548.50] I've got new laptops for you guys.
[9548.62 → 9550.58] So we'll lock them down before we distribute.
[9551.32 → 9551.72] Good.
[9552.30 → 9553.02] You lock it down.
[9553.06 → 9556.20] I'm just going to like to take it off the table and pull my laptop out of my bag.
[9556.26 → 9557.16] So those are your options.
[9557.16 → 9560.60] We'll ban your,
[9560.60 → 9561.92] your laptop off the network.
[9562.52 → 9565.22] You can't ban my laptop from the network.
[9565.70 → 9566.04] Yeah,
[9566.04 → 9566.32] we can.
[9566.64 → 9566.76] No,
[9566.78 → 9567.70] you can't.
[9567.70 → 9567.96] Yeah,
[9567.96 → 9568.30] we can.
[9569.70 → 9570.28] I'm not,
[9570.50 → 9572.42] I won't be able to get any work done.
[9573.16 → 9574.26] All you can use a work laptop.
[9574.38 → 9574.92] That's locked down.
[9576.06 → 9577.10] I'll just bring one from home.
[9578.14 → 9578.86] We'll ban that one.
[9579.38 → 9579.54] Fine.
[9579.54 → 9580.16] I'll buy another one.
[9580.16 → 9582.96] What are you going to do?
[9583.80 → 9584.76] What are you going to do?
[9585.10 → 9585.76] What are you going to do?
[9586.14 → 9586.88] What are you going to do?
[9586.92 → 9587.32] Smart guy?
[9588.22 → 9588.66] You ever think of that?
[9588.66 → 9590.06] Change the whole network to approved only?
[9590.24 → 9590.84] That would suck.
[9592.26 → 9592.62] No,
[9592.74 → 9592.96] Luke.
[9593.92 → 9594.24] No,
[9594.50 → 9594.90] no.
[9595.84 → 9596.24] Linus,
[9596.30 → 9597.72] why are you doing this to me?
[9599.02 → 9599.78] What are you going to do?
[9599.80 → 9600.10] I'm kidding.
[9600.50 → 9600.68] Ugh.
[9601.88 → 9603.40] How many hours do I have in cross code?
[9603.40 → 9604.16] I'm going to check.
[9605.12 → 9606.84] We'll just hire like a lot of people.
[9606.84 → 9610.60] We've got the
[9610.60 → 9612.18] the infra Linus team.
[9612.30 → 9619.10] They just follow him around with like tablets just to block firewall rules of Macs and ports.
[9619.38 → 9619.40] And,
[9619.40 → 9621.00] uh,
[9621.24 → 9622.54] how do you,
[9622.66 → 9622.74] uh,
[9622.74 → 9623.56] how do you check that?
[9624.50 → 9624.94] Uh,
[9624.94 → 9626.40] you should be able to see on the games page.
[9626.52 → 9626.90] Here we go.
[9627.06 → 9627.24] Yeah.
[9627.84 → 9628.02] Oh,
[9628.04 → 9628.44] there it is.
[9629.04 → 9629.44] Whoa.
[9629.78 → 9630.12] Okay.
[9630.12 → 9631.18] Some of this has got to be,
[9631.32 → 9632.20] I left it on overnight.
[9632.30 → 9634.70] I apparently have 270 hours in cross code.
[9634.76 → 9635.08] There's no way.
[9635.12 → 9635.36] Oh yeah.
[9635.36 → 9636.78] Cause my son played,
[9636.98 → 9637.96] played through as well.
[9638.04 → 9639.44] So it's probably like half of that.
[9639.88 → 9640.20] Uh,
[9640.26 → 9640.70] but anyway,
[9640.70 → 9641.46] I definitely,
[9641.46 → 9643.56] I definitely have over a hundred hours in cross code.
[9643.62 → 9644.18] It's a perfect game.
[9645.12 → 9645.48] Okay.
[9645.68 → 9647.04] I think that's it for this week.
[9647.16 → 9648.30] We'll see you again next week.
[9648.58 → 9649.30] Same bad time.
[9649.38 → 9650.08] Same bad channel.
[9651.02 → 9651.42] Okay.
[9651.42 → 9651.68] Bye.
[9651.68 → 9651.82] Bye.
[9651.82 → 9651.86] Bye.
[9651.86 → 9651.90] Bye.
[9651.90 → 9651.92] Bye.

[9653.86 → 9653.90] Bye.
[9653.90 → 9653.94] Bye.
[9653.94 → 9653.98] Bye.
[9653.98 → 9654.00] Bye.
[9654.00 → 9654.42] Bye.
[9654.42 → 9654.44] Bye.
[9654.44 → 9654.48] Bye.
[9654.48 → 9655.02] Bye.
[9655.02 → 9655.04] Bye.
[9655.04 → 9655.06] Bye.
[9655.06 → 9655.10] Bye.
[9655.10 → 9655.98] Bye.
[9655.98 → 9656.02] Bye.
[9656.02 → 9657.02] Bye.
[9657.02 → 9657.06] Bye.
[9657.06 → 9657.10] Bye.
[9657.10 → 9659.02] Bye.
[9659.02 → 9659.10] Bye.
[9659.10 → 9659.14] Bye.
[9659.14 → 9661.02] Bye.
[9661.02 → 9661.10] Bye.
[9665.36 → 9667.56] Bye.
[9667.56 → 9667.86] Man,
[9667.86 → 9668.94] I have to be careful when tearing.
