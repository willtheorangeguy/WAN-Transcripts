2:59:09 "Reading is unmatched as a referential material" I'm 23, and there are SO many times where I have needed to troubleshoot a new service or technology and the ONLY "literature" on it is a YouTube video tutorial. Am I the only one that dislikes receiving a new device and the instruction booklet provided is a QR code to a YouTube tutorial? My friends have thought it was weird that I don't like using YouTube as a library of information, but this topic makes me feel better about my take on it. Some people are getting better at timestamping to organize information, but that cannot compete with wikipedias or books. 

Sometimes one of my favorite hobbies is to just find a wikipedia article about something, read the page, then click on a hyperlink in it to find out more about something tangentially related. This goes for anything; science, gaming, whatever it is. Reading intricate lore of a video game universe and seeing how it's all connected in a wikipedia site makes that universe feel so fleshed out.
