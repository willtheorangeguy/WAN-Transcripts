[0.00 --> 6.36]  show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week google's ai overviews feature launched
[6.36 --> 12.24]  and is doing all kinds of wacky things citing the onion recommending the health benefits of
[12.24 --> 19.72]  drinking urine um good job google uh in other news spotify bricks its thing which is going to
[19.72 --> 24.84]  make a lot more sense to you if you know what the thing is which we will cover later what else we
[24.84 --> 31.94]  got today ltt released third-party investigation summary and the arm windows revolution might come
[31.94 --> 39.04]  packed with a privacy nightmare oh yeah that's going to be very interesting we'll talk about that
[51.04 --> 52.96]  do i need to oh okay
[52.96 --> 65.74]  the land show is brought to you by ridge acronis moose end and our new wancho partner secret lab
[65.74 --> 70.74]  we've been sitting on their chairs for years so it just made sense check them out at the link in the
[70.74 --> 76.94]  video description to start us off we've got the ltt release third-party investigation summary lmg
[76.94 --> 81.72]  committed to releasing the results when this whole thing started and they did so by posting it on x
[81.72 --> 87.74]  formerly known as twitter the wancho is not the place to discuss hr matters so we won't be talking
[87.74 --> 92.92]  about it here go check it out yourself if you are interested i also need to note that any comments in
[92.92 --> 99.10]  live chat or merch messages about this topic will just be ignored and any bullying or harassment of
[99.10 --> 104.66]  any involved party could result in consequences including a permanent ban so let's just not but
[104.66 --> 110.56]  let us continue on with the show yeah do you want to jump right into spotify breaking its thing
[110.56 --> 117.76]  yeah okay so first of all i had completely forgotten about the car thing yes okay so it's
[117.76 --> 123.08]  an accessory forget about it i never knew it existed slash infotainment device and the idea
[123.08 --> 128.78]  was to be able to have spotify in a car that doesn't have android auto or doesn't have carplay
[128.78 --> 134.14]  or maybe you just don't feel like using android auto or carplay and you just wanted this dedicated
[134.14 --> 139.82]  device to connect to spotify and what's kind of cool about it is that people weren't just using it in
[139.82 --> 146.24]  their cars um i saw was it i don't know it was someone uh someone on the internet um said that
[146.24 --> 151.08]  they kind of used it in their workshop but basically it was just an interface that allowed you to
[151.08 --> 159.60]  interface with spotify um it was invite only and it was launched in april of 2021 and then launched
[159.60 --> 167.42]  publicly in february of 2022 for 90 dollars it was then pulled from sale just five months later
[167.42 --> 174.96]  meaning that many devices many users who own these devices have had them for less than two years and
[174.96 --> 184.04]  nobody who has one has had it for more than about three years now just this week spotify well okay hold
[184.04 --> 191.62]  on first of all spotify began noticing people um that began notifying people that the car thing will be
[191.62 --> 201.10]  discontinued as of december 9th of this year and it will be rendered completely inoperable so not only
[201.10 --> 209.30]  are they discontinuing it they're actually going okay this is the date this is the hard date throw it
[209.30 --> 215.38]  in the garbage it gets better i mean worse sorry worse that was a verbal typo it gets worse
[215.38 --> 225.46]  spotify is neither offering a refund nor is it even offering a store f***ing credit it is basically
[225.46 --> 233.30]  going hey thanks for your 90 we hope you enjoyed the limited amount of time that you had to own that
[233.30 --> 241.52]  product that we i don't know i guess this is now a retroactive lease agreement um i think you might
[241.52 --> 246.50]  have basically just specify this but when was the last what like when people someone have ordered it
[246.50 --> 251.42]  the same day that it was discontinued no people could have ordered this as recently as march april
[251.42 --> 259.12]  may june july as recently as the summer of 2022 okay so a little less than two years ago
[259.12 --> 266.86]  that's wild though i don't get it i don't understand why like i i could understand saying like okay we're
[266.86 --> 271.54]  going to end of life this thing it's not going to receive updates but it would probably keep working
[271.54 --> 277.88]  for a pretty considerable amount of time uh well yes and no because whatever whatever api hooks it
[277.88 --> 284.80]  might rely on maybe it doesn't and i mean this is a funny one to me because it is mind-blowing to me
[284.80 --> 289.92]  my understanding and guys correct me if i'm wrong here my understanding is that it's it's just like an
[289.92 --> 299.42]  android based pretty simple thing um so from my point of view i don't really see the reason
[299.42 --> 305.54]  why this wouldn't have just been like running the android app in the background and the interface
[305.54 --> 309.80]  wouldn't have just been the same as any other device in which case to luke's point there's no
[309.80 --> 314.26]  reason it couldn't just keep working for a very long period of time kind of like when pebble stopped
[314.26 --> 319.76]  getting updates to the app yeah dude that worked for years yeah they didn't actually kill it yeah
[319.76 --> 329.00]  they didn't actively shut it down yeah um people are trying to sell them i'm finding uh like ebay.ca
[329.00 --> 334.78]  people are trying to sell so the only reason i can think of for them to actively kill it right now
[334.78 --> 342.22]  would be if they created some kind of custom back end or custom interface for it to interact with
[342.22 --> 348.24]  and this is something that maybe you can explain to me okay because i don't understand it when i read
[348.24 --> 354.62]  comments in the youtube creator studio app they are yeah you've talked to me yeah i've talked to you
[354.62 --> 363.42]  about this okay they are not the same as the ones that are publicly accessible okay so for example
[363.42 --> 370.06]  if i sort by newest the creator studio app will be like missing a bunch of them and if i go sort by
[370.06 --> 375.54]  newest in the on the live site they're all there there there's more of them there
[375.54 --> 384.64]  why the ever loving fuck do they have two databases of the comments on this video
[384.64 --> 391.20]  no no no no no hold on hold on that stop typing stop typing stop typing now they're typing yeah i know
[391.20 --> 397.42]  what they're typing too okay youtube is a massive service that has people accessing it from all over
[397.42 --> 403.66]  the world it operates at a scale that is barely imaginable to the lay person they absolutely
[403.66 --> 413.08]  have geo-replicated servers running their services i get it that's not what this is i don't i don't
[413.08 --> 419.56]  think it's and i know this i know this for a fact it's it's i'm hooking into a separate
[419.56 --> 425.94]  for whatever reason that i can't possibly fathom it is it is a sub it's a subset
[425.94 --> 437.28]  why why would you redo work help me well i don't i don't think they did redo work um i don't think
[437.28 --> 443.62]  they're pulling from two different data sets um i'm not necessarily sure what's going on it doesn't
[443.62 --> 449.56]  make a ton of sense to me but i don't know how the thing is built and i mean this isn't this isn't
[449.56 --> 454.78]  my actual job either so i'm sure developers out there could give a better answer but to me it feels
[454.78 --> 459.50]  like you have two you have probably two different front end solutions pulling in different ways
[459.50 --> 467.76]  pulling at different times um why the creator one like you're saying it doesn't have ones that are
[467.76 --> 473.56]  on the live one that feels almost backwards to me yeah i would feel like the creator one would pull
[473.56 --> 478.18]  like more frequently you would think that that's what i would think so the fact that it works the
[478.18 --> 485.12]  other way around feels weird to me yeah i don't know i i can't fully explain it personally okay
[485.12 --> 491.86]  personally i if i was building this thing i would expect them to act identically well yeah i can
[491.86 --> 496.30]  understand how there would be two different entire teams like the the team that works on the youtube
[496.30 --> 500.86]  studio app is probably a team of people that is completely different but why are they doing
[500.86 --> 507.06]  anything other than tapping into the same api why so they could but they could in a different way
[507.06 --> 512.96]  okay why maybe they pull comments less frequently whatever but why they probably don't talk to each
[512.96 --> 515.02]  other so they don't necessarily know how the other team's doing it
[515.02 --> 524.50]  i would i would think that there would be some form of standardized thing but like i have no idea i
[524.50 --> 529.36]  haven't worked at a company in that scale and it just doesn't make sense to me at all so i'm trying
[529.36 --> 534.42]  to make assumptions about something that i don't get how it would become that way but yeah it's a
[534.42 --> 539.74]  it's a it's a baffling thing dude there was i i think it's teams not directly communicating with
[539.74 --> 545.04]  each other accessing the same repository but in different ways and that's creating a frustrating
[545.04 --> 550.78]  experience but there was another discrepancy that i found a while back that just completely broke my
[550.78 --> 556.00]  brain i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can pull it up because i i sent it to our youtube rep who is a
[556.00 --> 561.12]  wonderful human being and one of my favoritest persons that i've ever had the pleasure of
[561.12 --> 565.06]  dealing with at uh at a tech company um
[565.06 --> 569.92]  oh this is a funny one might i be the same repo separate
[569.92 --> 580.24]  i don't know all right um anyway what is what is the oh
[580.24 --> 588.16]  yeah yeah yeah here we go here we go so i sent a follow-up in uh in march uh so a couple of months
[588.16 --> 595.54]  ago um creator studio mobile app shows 98 replies on this thread uh second screenshot is showing
[595.54 --> 600.88]  everything that shows up when i scroll all the way down come on folks uh so you can have a look at my
[600.88 --> 607.02]  screenshots here this is the creator studio app so it even managed to log the number of replies
[607.02 --> 614.14]  there are supposed to be okay and this is oh dang it uh great here we go and then here
[614.14 --> 620.16]  is everything that comes up that's all of them that's every reply there is no more room to scroll
[620.16 --> 627.10]  it's like eight and when i accessed it publicly because the reason the reason that i was that i was
[627.10 --> 632.24]  drawn to this one in particular was because i had replied to it so i replied to it and i was checking
[632.24 --> 639.02]  i was checking in on replies to my reply because it was an active conversation i not only can only
[639.02 --> 643.12]  see these eight responses i can't see my own fucking message
[643.12 --> 650.74]  when did you had said are those is there a time thing so are all those messages from
[650.74 --> 656.70]  before a certain period of time this is what a decent amount of my theory is leaning so i think
[656.70 --> 665.00]  those messages are yeah i think it is truncated here but what i can't imagine is any reason why
[665.00 --> 669.72]  yeah i don't know i just i think i think that whatever's pulling it is not happening at the same
[669.72 --> 673.60]  rate that it happens on the live no because i could go back ages later and they still wouldn't be there
[673.60 --> 678.96]  oh yeah yeah so this this is this is the kind of stuff you guys think you got your new youtube
[678.96 --> 683.46]  interface and you're all mad about that guys that is the least of their problems they can't even
[683.46 --> 689.80]  figure out how many fucking comments are in are in a chain like man i i remember i remember talking
[689.80 --> 694.80]  to someone someone at youtube about this years ago i was like look if you guys want to be a social
[694.80 --> 699.58]  media platform you could be you could be the biggest social media platform like practically
[699.58 --> 705.28]  overnight but you've got to deal with comments you've got to deal with user to user interaction
[705.28 --> 711.86]  because it's it's a cluster bomb right now and to their credit they've done a lot with respect to
[711.86 --> 718.20]  um with respect to moderation automatic moderation of like um bots and stuff like that it's not
[718.20 --> 723.48]  perfect but it's so much better than it was a year or two ago but the fact that they don't have like
[723.48 --> 729.58]  i can't imagine people aren't posting like ascii tanks anymore but there sure is a lot of others
[729.58 --> 737.92]  there's a lot less porn spam a lot less like way less and it's far less overt there's no more whatsapp
[737.92 --> 743.64]  numbers and usernames they have they have cut down on a look what i'm seeing a ton of and i'm seeing
[743.64 --> 749.78]  this ubiquitously on every video on the platform is amazon's groundbreaking new cryptocurrency
[749.78 --> 756.82]  i haven't actually seen a lot of those lately either sorry go ahead um is is replies that look
[756.82 --> 764.00]  extremely real and then you look at the little photo yep and you're like i still come across a lot
[764.00 --> 768.22]  of those but i see those all the time dude what's even the point of those those have got to perform
[768.22 --> 773.00]  a lot worse yeah those can't be that effective so in terms of cutting down on the if i wouldn't be
[773.00 --> 778.74]  too surprised if there are some but those comments a lot of the time users clicking on profiles hoping
[778.74 --> 785.56]  sure look we can acknowledge the improvement work they wouldn't do it but we can acknowledge the
[785.56 --> 790.72]  improvement they don't do it as much yes not even it's improved it's improved so the names needing to
[790.72 --> 795.82]  not be like phone numbers and whatsapp ids and stuff that's a big improvement okay so i know that
[795.82 --> 801.26]  it's been at least a conversation i don't know internally at google but but externally to google
[801.26 --> 806.52]  sure for years that what they should be doing is they should be doing like a more of a reddit style
[806.52 --> 811.70]  upvoting and downvoting system if they really want to improve comment quality and do they not is
[811.70 --> 817.28]  there not can you not downvote you can upvote and downvote but what you can't have is conversation
[817.28 --> 825.24]  uh threads within a parent comment okay so you can't have like multiple branches off of of a
[825.24 --> 829.28]  that actually gets pretty confusing when people are replying to each other within that does get
[829.28 --> 834.28]  confusing so uh so this ended up on speaking of reddit this ended up on the ltt subreddit when i
[834.28 --> 842.62]  replied to someone on the um the pool cleaning robot video and and people started kind of saying
[842.62 --> 848.78]  blindness is super aggressive and defensive here when they thought i was replying to the parent comment
[848.78 --> 857.60]  but what i was actually replying to was one of the comments that was a sub comment under it by the
[857.60 --> 863.58]  original poster so what because i added them the assumption was that it was replying to the parent
[863.58 --> 871.78]  comment but it wasn't i was i was directly addressing things that they had said and when some people
[871.78 --> 877.96]  noticed and were like um actually people were like oh what he said makes way more sense because he was
[877.96 --> 883.02]  actually replying to a completely different comment but it gets even better and this is this is where
[883.02 --> 890.64]  i'm going with this uh tying back to the mobile app when i sort by newest i can't see if a comment is a
[890.64 --> 899.72]  parent or child comment so i never even knew that the original post existed i replied directly to
[899.72 --> 906.80]  their reply to their own comment not knowing that it was a child comment rather than a parent comment
[906.80 --> 912.52]  so when i saw some of the backlash to what i said i was completely thrown for a loop i was like
[912.52 --> 920.12]  oh youtube youtube youtube but we can't live with you we can't live without you
[920.12 --> 927.34]  hey thanks for this career um anywho spotify what should they do what can they do to make this right
[927.34 --> 932.34]  because i mean it's not going to do us any good to just say oh yeah spotify bad people i hate them
[932.34 --> 938.66]  forever what what can they do now some amount of store credit would probably be good at the very
[938.66 --> 944.42]  least is that enough um how much it was a 90 device this is not a cheap this is not some throwaway
[944.42 --> 950.12]  meme product this is something people bought for nearly a hundred u.s dollars i mean probably a hundred
[950.12 --> 953.50]  bucks by the time they pay for shipping for it i don't know if they free shipped it but whatever
[953.50 --> 959.36]  in the neighborhood of a hundred u.s dollars that's not like meme i bought it at the dollar store money
[959.36 --> 962.78]  yeah um
[962.78 --> 966.56]  i don't know
[966.56 --> 973.40]  you have to be able to stop supporting things eventually yeah that's a really good point and
[973.40 --> 980.16]  and whatever reason they did it for the way it interfaces with spotify is not in a generic way
[980.16 --> 987.56]  that will continue to work until some unforeseeable time in the future so yeah you've got to be able
[987.56 --> 993.50]  to discontinue stuff but like this clearly isn't right too early um they did stop selling it what
[993.50 --> 998.48]  a year and a half ago so that's good you should probably i believe you should give it more legs than
[998.48 --> 1003.74]  that um and then i mean it isn't turning off for another seven months so it will have been two and a
[1003.74 --> 1011.50]  half years by the time it actually turns off in my opinion you should never really like deactivate
[1011.50 --> 1019.84]  things just let them rot eventually i don't know i'd want to see i don't think you're going to be
[1019.84 --> 1025.42]  able to allow like my my brain wants to is is thinking about like when when games shut down we
[1025.42 --> 1029.74]  always ask them like oh make it so that people can i don't think that's necessarily going to be
[1029.74 --> 1034.86]  able to happen because this isn't like you probably can't like plug a usb into this thing and like
[1034.86 --> 1040.90]  reprogram it i mean easily if it's if it is is it android based does anyone know because if it is
[1040.90 --> 1046.38]  then you almost certainly i've never seen one i mean so i could be wrong you 100 can't okay well
[1046.38 --> 1053.04]  then they should do that yeah i mean and look it's linux based why don't they do that okay people just do
[1053.04 --> 1058.94]  that anyways can i make an argument hold on hold on hold on it's hackable wait one second i know but
[1058.94 --> 1063.66]  we're gonna get there we're gonna get give me a second all right i can understand i was hanging
[1063.66 --> 1066.98]  out with i was having a good time i know that we were vibing i know that's why i took it away
[1066.98 --> 1070.32]  i just hate seeing joy on your face
[1070.32 --> 1079.26]  i um i can understand why they might not necessarily be able to do that there may be
[1079.26 --> 1087.60]  intellectual property concerns in the code right oh yeah okay there could be okay there could be okay
[1087.60 --> 1097.42]  however i think at the very least some kind of nudge nudge or facilitation
[1097.42 --> 1105.28]  for the open source community to to to take it over is in order here i understand why legal might
[1105.28 --> 1113.36]  not have allowed it but i hate this this is such a terrible precedent it's such a terrible way of
[1113.36 --> 1118.34]  behaving as a company that it almost doesn't really matter what the legal advice was you've
[1118.34 --> 1125.16]  got to find a way to do the right thing yeah and the right thing is obviously to make it able to
[1125.16 --> 1130.80]  continue to work and the very very least they could have done is to not actively brick it so apparently
[1130.80 --> 1136.58]  people have already done a usb unlock of it there's already a jailbreak yes what i think would be
[1136.58 --> 1142.64]  pretty sick in my opinion there's apparently a subreddit already i love it
[1142.64 --> 1148.24]  car thing hacks nice uh what i think would be pretty sick is if they if they gave some spotify
[1148.24 --> 1155.54]  developer time to the open source project i think that would be that would be such even if they're
[1155.54 --> 1162.46]  still gonna shut it down in december or whatever i think that would be such a a good faith good guy
[1162.46 --> 1168.04]  move that people would be willing to look past a lot of the crappiness of this situation overall
[1168.04 --> 1173.60]  it's not great it hasn't been conducted great so far and they can't commit i'm just gonna defend
[1173.60 --> 1178.52]  them slightly they can't commit to this forever no you can't support something forever but if they're
[1178.52 --> 1183.20]  like all right problem with smart devices that's why i didn't buy that uh that floor cleaning robot
[1183.20 --> 1188.84]  because i told you about that conversation right where i was like okay but what happens if you go
[1188.84 --> 1194.04]  bankrupt does it operate without your cloud thing and they're like well yeah we're it's not gonna go
[1194.04 --> 1199.50]  away i'm like right but if it does what happens is it a brick well yeah but we're doing great we're not
[1199.50 --> 1204.94]  gonna go away you're an idiot i'm not gonna buy it was it was it was like eighteen thousand dollars
[1204.94 --> 1209.12]  or something like i'm not gonna spend that kind of money on something that just turns off a lot of
[1209.12 --> 1214.70]  things like that like infrastructure like that is going to be in deployment for the entire existence
[1214.70 --> 1218.98]  of that building i could expect that robot to work for 25 years i don't think i don't know
[1218.98 --> 1223.64]  even if your company doesn't go under you could get acquired by someone who doesn't give two shits
[1223.64 --> 1228.52]  about floor cleaning robots maybe they want to use your your automated pathfinding technology for a
[1228.52 --> 1232.64]  military application or something i don't care about my stupid badminton building yeah see you
[1232.64 --> 1238.84]  later you never know you don't know yeah but so i yeah i think i think that would actually be very
[1238.84 --> 1245.66]  cool is if spotify software developers spotify software engineers were given a little bit of time
[1245.66 --> 1250.06]  it has to be limited it's not gonna be able to be a ton they're discontinuing this for a reason
[1250.06 --> 1254.48]  but a decent amount of time enough time to make a really solid
[1254.48 --> 1262.64]  uh contribution to the open source project don't take it over don't have anyone become
[1262.64 --> 1266.66]  leads on it or anything but try to contribute really heavily and get it to a point where the
[1266.66 --> 1271.58]  open source community is like pretty stoked on it and then just let them have it and leave
[1271.58 --> 1281.64]  and that's not like a happy ending but it's a neat ending i don't think it's that kind of device
[1281.64 --> 1288.94]  i mean i'm sure in open source that does exist i'm sure it does too
[1288.94 --> 1297.66]  all right oh man what is our next topic going to be imagine imagine
[1297.66 --> 1305.58]  the fact that he can't even get it out this is not a good sign he's never had this problem
[1305.58 --> 1312.10]  i haven't been cancelled in a while just imagine being like yeah you know what this isn't good
[1312.10 --> 1318.40]  enough i need i need to push contributing code imagine like just having that
[1318.40 --> 1326.08]  open source open legs i need some people to test this one
[1326.08 --> 1328.80]  push the contributing code then you gotta pull it
[1328.80 --> 1333.18]  i'm on the alpha version of the the new thing
[1333.18 --> 1339.62]  i need to really access to all the features works with android 15
[1339.62 --> 1344.30]  oh man all righty do you want to pick our next topic
[1344.30 --> 1350.18]  yeah yeah yeah should we do our new channel yeah actually i want to i want to see like because
[1350.18 --> 1354.84]  i think a lot of people don't know that it's live i want to see comments live of what people think
[1354.84 --> 1359.20]  of like the voice and stuff because it's a relatively short video so people could go watch
[1359.20 --> 1363.54]  it i mean it's our own video we can watch it yeah we can react to our own video dang it
[1363.54 --> 1369.96]  we can do that we can do that it's the internet it's it's online it's it's brought to you by
[1369.96 --> 1376.12]  um a secret lab secret yeah there's their logo sure whatever that one's not even legible yeah
[1376.12 --> 1384.32]  way to go luke oh what a guy it's obviously my fault um all right i've got i've got it loaded up
[1384.32 --> 1388.64]  dan are they able to hear if i if i do stuff why don't i do a couple pings you can make sure my audio
[1388.64 --> 1393.62]  is working yep i can see that coming through it's here folks i'm just gonna play it for you we're
[1393.62 --> 1399.02]  gonna watch it together and we're gonna talk about how it came to be can we hear that's the question
[1399.02 --> 1404.76]  uh i mean luke and i have listened to it but okay whatever hopefully we can but yeah yeah it'd be
[1404.76 --> 1412.50]  nice i'll see what i can do okay yeah i don't hear it now all right linus lap that's what the button
[1412.50 --> 1420.98]  says okay what srp of 100 us it's a fully modular atx power supply with a single fan mode the power
[1420.98 --> 1428.14]  supply comes in reasonable packaging and measures 150 by 86 by 140 millimeters considering cable
[1428.14 --> 1435.06]  flexibility it has an effective depth of 175 millimeters the corsair rm 750e is accompanied
[1435.06 --> 1440.20]  by the accessories as shown and supported by a seven-year warranty this warranty period is as
[1440.20 --> 1446.32]  expected for a power supply of this class the fully modular cables are of acceptable quality they have
[1446.32 --> 1452.02]  plastic insulation and are moderately flexible the provided cable set includes a single 12 volt high
[1452.02 --> 1459.08]  power cable allowing it to power all types of high wattage gpus ltt labs conducted all of the
[1459.08 --> 1464.90]  following testing at an ambient temperature of 20 degrees celsius the full test suite including tests
[1464.90 --> 1470.12]  at extended temperature ranges is available on the labs website linked in the description but before we get
[1470.12 --> 1477.38]  to the results here's a message from our sponsor the corsair rm 750e carries an 80 plus gold rating and we
[1477.38 --> 1483.80]  measured 90 efficiency at 50 of its maximum rated load that's equivalent to power supplies in a similar
[1483.80 --> 1492.28]  class throughout the full rated output power range of 750 watts there was a 0.162 volts drop on the 12
[1492.28 --> 1498.00]  volt rail which is within atx specifications and similar to most other power supplies we've tested
[1498.00 --> 1504.10]  the rest of the output rails met atx specifications this stability should provide a steady platform for the
[1504.10 --> 1508.60]  operation of other components in the computer the peak to peak signal ripple of the fully loaded
[1508.60 --> 1516.20]  power supplies 12 volt rail was average for its price and wattage at 31 millivolts the 5 volt and 3.3
[1516.20 --> 1523.36]  volt rails had signal ripple of 17 millivolts and 21 millivolts respectively modern power supplies
[1523.36 --> 1529.24]  typically have no issue complying with atx ripple specs and this unit is no different we test the power
[1529.24 --> 1534.84]  supplies resilience to momentary power dropouts and ripples using our brownout test that interrupts the
[1534.84 --> 1540.76]  input power for a few milliseconds this allows us to measure how long of a power dropout the sample can
[1540.76 --> 1548.44]  sustain without interrupting the output power the corsair rm 750e was measured to withstand 13 milliseconds
[1548.44 --> 1556.92]  and 14 milliseconds dropout at full rated load for 115 volt and 230 volt inputs respectively this unit performs
[1556.92 --> 1563.72]  similarly to other power supplies the excursion test momentarily applies up to 200 of the rated load
[1563.72 --> 1569.40]  to test a power supply's ability to support components that may temporarily require more than
[1569.40 --> 1576.36]  their rated current the corsair rm 750e withstood a subset of the excursions but failed with others
[1576.36 --> 1583.32]  it's compatible with most systems but may struggle with high-end hardware connecting the corsair rm 750e is
[1583.32 --> 1588.52]  is equipped with the protections listed providing the full suite of protections for you and your equipment
[1588.52 --> 1595.00]  we measured the overpower protection to engage at a maximum of 131 of rated load while the 12 volt rail
[1595.00 --> 1602.44]  alone is capable of 81 amps 130 of its rating this is equivalent to similarly rated power supplies offering
[1602.44 --> 1608.12]  good protection against component faults while also allowing the power draw to slightly exceed the official rating
[1608.12 --> 1613.72]  we can recommend the corsair rm 750e because of its good load and line regulation and resilience to
[1613.72 --> 1619.56]  cross loads for full specifications and test results follow the link to the product page on the ltt labs
[1619.56 --> 1626.28]  website all right so let's talk about it i i jotted down some notes from chat while we were going
[1626.92 --> 1633.32]  um so a couple of these i think i can just answer immediately a couple of these maybe become discussion uh one
[1633.32 --> 1639.80]  of them is voice too slow in that case in my opinion just adjust the video playback speed you know it's
[1639.80 --> 1645.64]  funny because i actually saw some comments saying that it was too fast on float plane adjust the video
[1645.64 --> 1651.48]  playback speed yeah like not too fast someone said that normally they watch at one and a half speed and
[1651.48 --> 1656.92]  they had to slow this one down to to 1x interesting so it's going to depend on your familiarity with the
[1656.92 --> 1662.36]  subject material i think i suspect people are saying like the voice cadence is off and stuff that'll improve over
[1662.36 --> 1670.28]  time um considering where we started it's way better the first time we previewed this was probably about
[1671.16 --> 1677.80]  three or four months ago something like that man this is this is a big improvement so it will
[1677.80 --> 1683.40]  consistently improve some comments that i saw were like it's not taking uh like breaks to breathe
[1685.00 --> 1689.96]  i mean it doesn't breathe so that makes sense i heard a breath though i heard it take a breath did you
[1689.96 --> 1694.92]  really it's irritating yeah it has a breath yeah it doesn't like pause like there's the sentence pauses
[1694.92 --> 1700.52]  they're not yeah it doesn't run out of air yeah i noticed that as well yeah um so like stuff like
[1700.52 --> 1707.00]  that will be improved over time yep um someone said i'd stop watching that's completely fine yeah um one of
[1707.00 --> 1712.52]  the reasons why people have been asking why we chose ai voice for this um because these aren't going to make
[1712.52 --> 1719.64]  like any money at all um and there's like well it's not just that these are not going to get any views
[1719.64 --> 1724.04]  which is why that's going to be a thing which is why they're not going to drive any revenue and i suspect
[1724.04 --> 1727.64]  watch time isn't necessarily going to be amazing stuff like that there's there's comments like i'd stop
[1727.64 --> 1734.36]  watching not enough emotion stuff like that that's fine it's not supposed to be hyped up really exciting
[1734.36 --> 1740.04]  interesting interesting content to watch it's supposed to be like i am interested in purchasing
[1740.04 --> 1748.20]  this product i would like a very on the point information heavy cookie cutter video third party
[1748.76 --> 1754.20]  validated give me the information and then if you're interested in diving into more because you
[1754.20 --> 1758.20]  saw one part that you found is interesting then you can jump to the labs website and get more info there
[1758.20 --> 1765.88]  it's not it's that i don't suspect unless you're like i really freaking love power supplies dude um i
[1765.88 --> 1770.20]  don't expect you're going to watch every video on this channel i i suspect the subscriber conversion
[1770.20 --> 1775.40]  for a channel like this is not going to be super high but if this was back in the day and i was
[1775.40 --> 1779.80]  building computers this is the exact type of stuff i would have tried to find because this is why i would
[1779.80 --> 1786.52]  look at content on youtube was because i wanted to see video of the thing out of the box that was like
[1786.52 --> 1790.36]  a hundred percent what i was looking for i didn't care about the unboxing experience i wanted to see
[1790.36 --> 1794.68]  the thing after it was out of the box and to verify some assumptions i was making and there's
[1794.68 --> 1797.96]  going to be people that are going to watch a lot of videos on the channel sure but they're not going
[1797.96 --> 1804.60]  to subscribe for entertainment unless maybe they work in the industry like if i if my if my job was
[1804.60 --> 1810.20]  procurement at a system integrator and i was just like totally oh well this is convenient if these
[1810.20 --> 1814.28]  guys are just going to test every power supply and i can just get a notification on my phone so i can
[1814.28 --> 1819.80]  make sure that i'm keeping up with with what's good because it's like my job absolutely i could
[1819.80 --> 1823.40]  see someone subscribing but for the average builder who's putting together a system for
[1824.76 --> 1829.48]  you know their roommate this quarter and you know doing something for their sister six months
[1829.48 --> 1834.44]  later you're not going to subscribe to it but it's very likely you'll watch one of them or you'll
[1834.44 --> 1839.72]  or you know what like we haven't given much thought to playlists i guess i just it just popped into my
[1839.72 --> 1844.28]  head maybe maybe bell uh jake belevance is is the channel manager for this but yeah um i don't
[1844.28 --> 1849.08]  think we've given a ton of thought to that yet but uh you know something that would be cool is if we
[1849.08 --> 1854.36]  had playlists that are like at various wattage ranges or playlists that are at various price
[1854.36 --> 1858.84]  points price points will be tough because they're going to change so unless we had a way to
[1860.20 --> 1865.48]  unless there's a way to like hook into youtube's api and and manage your playlists automatically or
[1865.48 --> 1869.00]  something like that based on you know pulling real-time pricing information or something i don't
[1869.00 --> 1873.88]  think we'll be able to do by price but if we could do it by wattage range for example then that would
[1873.88 --> 1878.12]  be a really cool way to go through the channel and basically go okay out of 500 watt power supplies okay
[1878.12 --> 1885.00]  i want to learn about some of these of course i understand and this is this is a comment that i saw
[1885.00 --> 1890.28]  i guess it was over on over on floatplane where someone was like this doesn't see or maybe it's on
[1890.28 --> 1894.84]  maybe it's on twitter um this doesn't seem to add a lot compared to reading an article
[1896.92 --> 1907.16]  you are right the correct format for a power supply one pager is a page yeah not a video but what we
[1907.16 --> 1915.80]  have to recognize is the realities that exist in the techosphere in the media sphere that have made it so
[1915.80 --> 1923.24]  that this abomination is now how you will find out about the the testing data of a power supply
[1924.12 --> 1931.96]  viewer habits have changed to video the money that used to be in written media is a fund is
[1931.96 --> 1937.88]  functionally gone compared to how it was in the in the you know early to mid to even late 2000s
[1937.88 --> 1944.76]  will not read something people will not read something and even if they did that site that
[1944.76 --> 1952.12]  writes that thing that no one's reading would have an extremely difficult time surviving so the
[1952.12 --> 1959.40]  equipment that's involved in this and the personnel that's involved in this um is is so expensive i
[1959.40 --> 1964.60]  just don't see a path where you could do this testing in a written format unless unless it was
[1965.24 --> 1969.40]  you know like to my point earlier about being very interesting to people who are in the industry
[1969.40 --> 1972.52]  unless it was like a paid subscription or something like that but that's not
[1973.08 --> 1978.92]  where we want to go at least with the basics of is this thing okay to buy what kind of computer can
[1978.92 --> 1983.88]  it power what kind of do its safety protections actually work like that's not something that we
[1983.88 --> 1990.28]  want to pay well um i do think that there could be more detailed testing data that might only really
[1990.28 --> 1996.84]  be useful to you know people who are going okay can we procure uh you know thousands of these for our
[1996.84 --> 2002.92]  systems for next quarter or something like that and okay an example of that or like i have an extremely
[2002.92 --> 2008.04]  particular type of load that i need to put on this sure um in the long term you know i could see us
[2008.04 --> 2013.96]  scaling up the number of those chroma testing units that we have and we could go okay yeah i mean or even
[2013.96 --> 2020.44]  do like paid testing yeah we'll we'll test 10 instead of just one we'll test 10 we'll run your suite on it
[2020.44 --> 2025.64]  whatever yeah or whatever the case may be so in in the in the long term there's all kinds of different
[2025.64 --> 2031.88]  directions that we can go with it but the reality is if we want this content to exist we've got to go
[2031.88 --> 2041.00]  where the reader is and the reader is now watching in video form um so and how many people that's a big
[2041.00 --> 2046.76]  question mark right is one of the answers we were trying to find when we were uh working on the concept
[2046.76 --> 2051.40]  for this channel because this channel exists because we want to make it we want this information to be
[2051.40 --> 2057.00]  available um but one of the things that we had to figure out is okay how do we make this self-sufficient
[2057.00 --> 2061.64]  it's not the question wasn't even how do we make money the question was how do we make this
[2061.64 --> 2069.08]  make any sense um because don't kid yourself this is a creative company we're a media organization
[2069.08 --> 2075.80]  if you don't think that there were some misgivings internally around ai voice for example oh yeah come
[2075.80 --> 2081.96]  on guys there were absolutely misgivings but the way that we're looking at it and the way that we've
[2081.96 --> 2088.92]  messaged it internally is look this is not replacing human intervention a human develop this test suite and
[2088.92 --> 2096.36]  a human needs to test this power supply by the time we do that i'm sorry but there isn't for the for
[2096.36 --> 2104.68]  the two to four thousand views we're going to get on this video there just isn't any budget for the the
[2104.68 --> 2110.12]  media side of things and in the long term i want that to change i would love for that to change i would
[2110.12 --> 2115.88]  love for every look i would love in the longer term for us to be able to count on a hundred thousand or
[2115.88 --> 2120.76]  two hundred thousand views per video and for us to go okay let's scale it up like why are why are we
[2120.76 --> 2126.84]  doing this all cookie cutter now now that we've got this kind of momentum um but i don't know if it'll
[2126.84 --> 2133.72]  ever get there starts performing like that sure i just i don't see it happening personally well maybe i i
[2133.72 --> 2140.76]  see it happening in spikes like i i suspect if some like flagship gpu comes out and we have a gpu
[2140.76 --> 2147.00]  equivalent of power supply circuit so i'm making multiple assumptions here um it could be a banger
[2147.56 --> 2152.52]  but i think the day-to-day releases of that channel are not going to be able to and you might be right
[2152.52 --> 2159.24]  and see i i'd be happy to be wrong but like one of the one of the kind of tough conversations that i had
[2159.24 --> 2166.84]  to have with someone who um to their credit approached me about it sure approached me with the concerns right
[2166.84 --> 2172.04]  like that's what we want so they approached me with the concerns and they basically went look i i have
[2172.04 --> 2179.64]  serious i have serious ethical concerns i have serious creative concerns um i i don't understand who this is for
[2180.20 --> 2187.96]  um help explain it to me i basically went okay here's the situation we went and we looked at
[2187.96 --> 2195.40]  the very few channels that are left that are even trying to do dedicated videos on power on an
[2195.40 --> 2204.60]  individual power supply skew um we are expecting at the very best at the very very possible best
[2204.60 --> 2210.36]  somewhere in the neighborhood of like five to ten thousand views on average for each of these videos
[2210.36 --> 2216.44]  that puts our budget somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 25 dollars
[2218.60 --> 2222.36]  what would you have me do i want people to have this information
[2223.88 --> 2231.64]  i need to get it to them in video form my options are either that i outsource to some place where i can
[2231.64 --> 2238.12]  pay like slave labor wages which we have never done and i have never been comfortable with
[2238.12 --> 2245.72]  or we pay proper wages to the testers to the people who are working on creating this data
[2246.44 --> 2252.44]  we try to find a way to scale that from you know 10 to 25 bucks to maybe we can scrape together some
[2252.44 --> 2260.60]  affiliate revenue to make sure that this is sustainable in that form and we lean on automated tools as much
[2260.60 --> 2267.72]  as we have to to make this even remotely have a chance and they kind of went well i hope the voice
[2267.72 --> 2273.00]  can be better and at least it is at least it's better than it was it's a lot better in my opinion
[2273.00 --> 2278.44]  and and i i do like i said earlier suspect there will be continual improvement there i just i one thing
[2278.44 --> 2283.40]  that i disliked a lot was when it was your voice when it was a modification of your voice that was
[2283.40 --> 2288.28]  that that was odd for me i didn't like that so the funny thing is one of the reasons that we had actually
[2288.28 --> 2296.76]  leaned that way initially was that there seemed to be less community backlash to cloning my voice
[2296.76 --> 2302.92]  versus cloning a random one because i don't know why but it seems like the perception was less that we
[2302.92 --> 2312.44]  replaced a voice actor with an ai and the perception was more we are we are applying a an efficiency factor
[2312.44 --> 2320.04]  to linus's time by saving him the trouble of reading the lines and the the distinction is arbitrary yeah
[2320.04 --> 2327.32]  what but but but that voice sounding like me made it an extension of me instead of this whole this
[2327.32 --> 2333.72]  whole landscape is is weird enough oh i know right it's it's true because we're all figuring out kind of
[2333.72 --> 2338.84]  how we feel about these things and where the lines are and stuff um and while that's still happening it's
[2338.84 --> 2344.84]  just it's it's a little tricky but i think this is okay and i like the idea of if the channel does
[2344.84 --> 2349.48]  start performing well we could you know get talent for it or whatever that's that's interesting i do
[2349.48 --> 2354.52]  suspect the quoted number of views that you just said i think some of the videos on these channels
[2354.52 --> 2358.60]  are going to do a lot worse than that oh yeah and i think some of the videos on these channels will
[2358.60 --> 2364.68]  smash that out of the park i think so too i think um and yeah it's going to be very up and down i think
[2364.68 --> 2372.92]  very inconsistent here's something that i bet you guys didn't necessarily realize is the ai voice is
[2372.92 --> 2379.56]  not the only automation tool that's being used for these videos i don't think i knew that
[2381.40 --> 2383.48]  a human editor only watches the output
[2383.48 --> 2397.16]  of the video yeah whoa yeah so so the reason the script is a little bit formulaic sounding is because it's actually
[2398.28 --> 2405.48]  yeah so you're doing the same shots so are you are you naming the files in a certain way is that how it's doing it
[2405.48 --> 2413.32]  so all the shots will be the same all the graphics will be the same with the same names ish um the
[2413.32 --> 2420.28]  exact details of how it's done are going to be ed's department not mine right um but then the the the
[2420.28 --> 2424.68]  the little cut the little color commentary because that was something we realized about the first one
[2424.68 --> 2432.44]  that needed to be fixed it had no context it was just like the powerpoint whatever miller ripples
[2432.44 --> 2437.24]  like it didn't it didn't sound like anything if you don't already understand it right yeah and so i
[2437.24 --> 2444.44]  was like okay look guys we have to come up with a way to create a script that allows for some color
[2444.44 --> 2450.20]  commentary or we are going to completely lose any chance we could possibly have of people watching
[2450.20 --> 2456.76]  this thing and learning anything so when it says this is as expected for power supplies of this class
[2457.64 --> 2462.76]  there's basically variables there's almost like a drop down box this is worse than expected this is
[2462.76 --> 2468.28]  better than expected this is as expected so when it did like the cables are of acceptable bendiness or
[2468.28 --> 2474.84]  whatever the cables are of exceptional bendiness the cables are of subpar bendiness compared to our
[2474.84 --> 2481.96]  expectations and now a human is involved in in bending those cables and seeing okay yeah we know the depth of
[2481.96 --> 2486.28]  the power supply but like really what can you fit it because that was something that i asked to be added
[2486.28 --> 2489.96]  because the depth of a power supply doesn't tell you what case it can fit in you need to know
[2489.96 --> 2495.40]  once accounting for cable bendiness how deep it is right um so that was something that that's
[2495.40 --> 2501.80]  something that a human needs to do this is not ai content this is highly human created content
[2502.68 --> 2513.40]  that is edited together and voiced by automation tools it's something that i have no idea if it's
[2513.40 --> 2518.04]  gonna work but boy do i ever hope so given how much we've invested in it because i don't think
[2518.04 --> 2523.00]  the labs website on its own is going to have a chance of of reaching any kind of break-even point
[2523.00 --> 2529.96]  no it's got to be something that can be funded by the other branches of our company and that
[2530.76 --> 2535.32]  um and and that will allow us to reinvest in it and continue to build we have some ideas to help it
[2535.32 --> 2538.12]  uh but it will always kind of struggle a bit yeah
[2541.72 --> 2544.52]  exciting right well i'm excited
[2547.32 --> 2550.60]  oh right we're supposed to do merch message i'm excited to tell you guys about those
[2550.60 --> 2554.68]  uh do we have any store updates that we're supposed to talk about i haven't looked at that part of the
[2554.68 --> 2563.08]  oh oh yes we have a huge promotion that we are running right now on the ltt screwdriver this applies to
[2563.08 --> 2570.44]  any screwdriver that's right classic colors retro noctua or stubby if you buy any ltt screwdriver by

[2591.48 --> 2599.24]  legal info you got to go to ltstore.com products slash screwdriver so cool right anyway uh one of
[2599.24 --> 2603.72]  the things that you can do if you decide to order a screwdriver right now is you can leave a merch

[2607.64 --> 2611.64]  screen and then what we like acknowledge your comment no no no no no you should leave a merch
[2611.64 --> 2617.08]  message so you can throw money at your screen and get great quality merchandise in the mail in the
[2617.08 --> 2621.00]  cart you'll see a little box whenever we're live to leave a merch message it will go to producer
[2621.00 --> 2626.52]  dan who will pop it up on the bottom down there like that reply to it forward it internally to
[2626.52 --> 2633.80]  someone who can best get you an answer or oh sorry dad curate it sorry dan uh sorry my bad
[2634.68 --> 2640.68]  the button's broken yeah for sure or he will curate it for me and luke to address on the show dan do you
[2640.68 --> 2644.68]  want to hit us with a merch message to show the folks how it works sure absolutely yeah we've got a
[2644.68 --> 2650.68]  few here let's see uh would you make an apple leather jacket no
[2655.08 --> 2661.72]  so oh please make a medium tall i need to replace my leather jacket so bad so please
[2663.80 --> 2668.44]  you know how we didn't have tall shirts yet dan we're losing this war i don't care i will have them
[2668.44 --> 2675.96]  custard custom tailor me one you know how we did that mock neck yeah that we called the steve where
[2675.96 --> 2685.16]  it had the seam down the middle just like his iconic okay so i had oh no i had the jensen
[2686.12 --> 2692.76]  the steve apple i had planned so matthew from creator warehouse his amd ultimate tech upgrade is coming up
[2692.76 --> 2698.12]  okay and i don't know if it's going to make it into the cut because it's sponsored by amd so who
[2698.12 --> 2704.04]  knows what the it might not make it through our own internal business team you know right whatever
[2704.04 --> 2709.00]  and it's not like it's it's not like it matters in terms of our editorial integrity if we can
[2709.64 --> 2714.12]  talk about a future product or whatever so it's not the kind of thing that's not the kind of hill
[2714.12 --> 2718.20]  we're going to die on so it might not make it through our internal team it might not make it through
[2718.20 --> 2726.52]  amd but one of the things that happened in that video is matthew and i decided to tease a potential
[2726.52 --> 2732.28]  upcoming product called the jensen the jensen because we've wanted to do a leather jacket for a
[2732.28 --> 2736.20]  while i don't know what kind of leather we'd use we actually haven't gotten that far but one of the
[2736.20 --> 2743.80]  things we have decided is that the jacket will be designed by ai because of course it would oh
[2743.80 --> 2752.76]  he's already got some really great concepts so obviously because you know we have designers um we
[2752.76 --> 2758.44]  would make it actually function in the real world but it would have like pockets that don't open
[2759.96 --> 2765.80]  zippers that don't go anywhere at least it doesn't have to do hands you know ai things the ai the ai
[2765.80 --> 2773.72]  jacket the jensen huh uh dan dan huh i think if it's in a medium tall i will buy two right i think
[2773.72 --> 2779.96]  that sounds sick w please make a bomber though two in float plane chat uh has summarized my thoughts
[2779.96 --> 2785.56]  so far of that's going to be a really expensive joke how many do you think you're going to sell
[2785.56 --> 2788.68]  you're going to sell two to dan it's going to be a really expensive but he's going to use his employee
[2788.68 --> 2793.00]  thing so you'll make nothing i'll pay out of pocket i don't care dude i okay so you're selling two to
[2793.00 --> 2799.32]  dan i guarantee you i guarantee you okay guys come on let's hear from you who wants one dan i need i
[2799.32 --> 2804.36]  think we need to get a poll in here oh yeah right away yeah uh firefox let's get that poll and
[2804.36 --> 2809.80]  besides and besides if it doesn't sell in the in the google find your life video one of the one of the
[2809.80 --> 2815.00]  top comments was like along with all the float plane users i am 70 of people that use firefox or
[2815.00 --> 2820.20]  something like that i don't remember the exact sign and i i burst out laughing i was like oh but think
[2820.20 --> 2826.28]  about it this way luke even if we don't sell any of them infinite money glitch we just write them off
[2826.28 --> 2838.76]  oh all right we'll get that going you mad are you mad bro i'm voting no brother are you angry i do
[2838.76 --> 2845.64]  need to replace this jacket though why oh i'm so excited i i can't find a leather tailor to actually
[2845.64 --> 2849.72]  work on it we're still looking i'm trying to find an artist collective around here that could recommend
[2849.72 --> 2855.80]  an artisan but it's very very difficult i know a person who works with leather goods who lives on
[2855.80 --> 2862.84]  vancouver island because he came to uh ltx oh yeah you're not talking about that person are you
[2864.20 --> 2869.56]  is it someone i know no okay never mind um i can't find any company that makes them anymore
[2870.76 --> 2875.72]  so yeah all right well bummer for dan yeah yeah maybe we'll get him a jensen
[2876.60 --> 2881.88]  that'd be cool okay where's our where's our do you want pockets that don't open and zippers that
[2881.88 --> 2887.24]  are to nothing do you want that is that a good is that is that dude clothes are more interesting
[2887.24 --> 2892.20]  clothes are supposed to be self-expression artistic self-expression and in this case
[2892.20 --> 2898.20]  for this the person who has one brand of socks and one right i've been wearing one jacket for 10
[2898.20 --> 2902.44]  years of t-shirts 10 years i've been wearing this jacket in this case i haven't even changed my shoes
[2902.44 --> 2909.00]  in a decade in this case the use multiple pairs of the same one to be clear the use of ai actually makes
[2909.00 --> 2916.36]  sense it's it's so meta like it's an it could be an ironic expression it's not it's nvidia of like
[2916.36 --> 2923.56]  hating ai it needs a little uh pocket where's the ding it needs a just yeah exactly that's what i'm
[2923.56 --> 2928.28]  talking about that's the first time i've had to do that for luke he deserved it disgusting
[2928.28 --> 2934.52]  it needs to have a pocket on the on the like uh chest for uh your humane pin
[2938.76 --> 2942.68]  yeah but it should be like the wrong size because yeah yeah it has no concept it doesn't
[2942.68 --> 2945.48]  scale it doesn't fit all the product failure pockets if like the the
[2947.08 --> 2950.52]  like a slot for the rabbit we'll make it out of rabbit leather
[2950.52 --> 2961.16]  oh 45 000 jacket that's a lot of rabbits mood murdered yeah um oh they'd just be android anyway
[2961.16 --> 2965.56]  sorry uh were we supposed to be on a topic right now because i actually wanted to come back to psu
[2965.56 --> 2970.20]  circuit a little bit that was the second rich message that was one merch oh that was one okay
[2970.20 --> 2973.88]  uh hit me again and i'm just gonna leave this page open so i don't forget to talk about it okay
[2973.88 --> 2978.68]  yeah sure uh same sort of thing curious about the amount of stolen items found during tech upgrade
[2978.68 --> 2983.16]  videos were the items actually considered stolen or is this just a joke about the amount of stuff
[2983.16 --> 2991.16]  employees take back with them both a little bit of both i think yes both is good um okay
[2995.24 --> 3005.56]  sorry i was eating jerky um okay so part of it is that i was a little bit legitimately annoyed
[3005.56 --> 3014.28]  in some of the very early ones to find work property in people's homes nothing that mattered
[3015.16 --> 3020.12]  um in the grand scheme of things what were some of those things like what like cables
[3021.40 --> 3028.44]  like a like a cheap usb dock that realistically we didn't pay for and and probably they intended to
[3028.44 --> 3034.52]  return at some point because remember we started this series when work from home was a lot more
[3034.52 --> 3040.68]  common at our company because of all the covid lockdowns and stuff right so people had a lot of
[3040.68 --> 3049.08]  stuff at home that they were probably going to return it but it wasn't assetted at like asset tagged
[3049.08 --> 3056.84]  inventory so nothing would have prevented them from just keeping it and so it was this kind of gray area
[3056.84 --> 3067.16]  where it kind of started with me being like hey come on man and then obviously i ended up with a lot of
[3067.16 --> 3072.52]  false positives because legitimately people do end up with a lot of stuff that used to belong to the
[3072.52 --> 3080.12]  company you know we got ltt store well we also have the lmg store which is where people can sometimes get
[3080.12 --> 3087.48]  access to you know a unit that came in for b-roll for a sponsor and ended up having cosmetic damage
[3087.48 --> 3091.00]  and they were like well we don't want it back and it goes in the it goes in the giveaway pile we have
[3091.00 --> 3099.40]  a giveaway pile um we also have wild christmas parties not in like a like a tech bro silicon valley games
[3099.40 --> 3106.44]  industry kind of way in like uh wow i can't believe the giveaways um that they're giving that they have at this
[3106.44 --> 3113.96]  uh you know two drink maximum otherwise pretty you know controlled party um so so people end up with
[3113.96 --> 3119.96]  stuff from the christmas party uh people end up with we have done on occasion in the past um the
[3119.96 --> 3124.76]  christmas party is a lot of stuff it's hundreds of things every year we have done on occasion in the
[3124.76 --> 3130.36]  past um like extra credit things that people can do for what we call lmg bucks i don't think we've done
[3130.36 --> 3135.64]  that in a long time but in the early days i've never even heard of that yeah no we we would have stuff
[3135.64 --> 3141.88]  that's like ah this power supply has a broken fan in it linus could open it and put a new fan in
[3141.88 --> 3149.00]  or if you wanted to just like take it home with you and put a new fan in it then you can have 50 lmg bucks
[3149.00 --> 3154.44]  or something like that and if you if you buy stuff when i was off float planning yeah i've never heard of this
[3154.44 --> 3159.16]  almost almost no one used it but this is just an example of one of the ways that people could have obtained stuff
[3159.16 --> 3167.40]  over the years um i used to just get paid in hardware that i mean no yeah not by me yes well
[3167.40 --> 3173.88]  topped up you were above the legal limit otherwise yes yes yes yes you can't say stuff like that luke
[3173.88 --> 3183.08]  you gotta people are gonna you know how people are it was fun anyway so lmg bucks uh for stuff that's in
[3183.08 --> 3188.20]  our inventory that's like used we don't if people want to like buy it and we don't need it we don't
[3188.20 --> 3194.52]  charge full price for it so people can use lmg bucks to stretch a dollar pretty far so people people use
[3194.52 --> 3200.92]  lmg bucks um a lot so people have stuff that they've bought from work stuff that they have won from work
[3200.92 --> 3205.80]  stuff that they've taken home from work for legitimate purposes and in the case of dennis stuff
[3205.80 --> 3211.32]  that they've just taken um because i don't know he thinks he has tenure or something i'm not sure how
[3211.32 --> 3217.48]  that works in his head so it is a it is a combination of things and like anything it's been
[3217.48 --> 3222.44]  amusing for me to see the community speculation around it because the number of people that are
[3222.44 --> 3231.16]  outraged either way is baffling uh the people that are that are outraged that i am that i am such a
[3231.16 --> 3238.60]  that i'm such a i don't know overbearing horrible boss that i'm gonna be berating someone in public
[3238.60 --> 3245.64]  over this cable that they took um is a probably about equal to the number of people that hate me
[3245.64 --> 3253.24]  for being such a such a disorganized corporate overlord that i can't even inspire my team in this
[3253.24 --> 3259.16]  horrible toxic work environment to not be stealing anything that isn't bolted down like it's it's amazing
[3259.16 --> 3268.36]  how you could just take a a joke that's just a meme and interpret it as i've always i've always
[3268.36 --> 3276.44]  wondered like if we do one at my place what stuff like what stuff will not be stolen
[3278.12 --> 3280.36]  i because it's a lot of it like i don't even know
[3280.36 --> 3287.48]  like i i don't know well that's what asset tags are for yeah but sometimes there's asset
[3287.48 --> 3293.32]  tags on stuff that was given away really yeah oh really yeah okay well we'll see uh i might
[3293.32 --> 3297.24]  remember and then i think i have like three generations you know i personally select the
[3297.24 --> 3301.40]  items for the giveaway every year right yeah yeah that's what i know but there's there's three
[3301.40 --> 3306.20]  generations of computers in my place that are from my like weird upgrade thing that i have
[3306.20 --> 3311.72]  mm-hmm well i guess we'll see i like found some graphics cards at my dad's place
[3312.68 --> 3317.96]  and i recognize them as work property yeah yeah so i think we'll figure it out but i didn't even know
[3317.96 --> 3324.52]  but i did so like it's yeah it might be interesting guilty oh yeah i've taken stuff home
[3327.40 --> 3332.84]  i don't anymore but like i don't know the line used to be a lot more blurry when there was like three of
[3332.84 --> 3339.88]  us um it used to be as simple as like hey my gpu died um i want a game this weekend and i like
[3340.52 --> 3344.76]  don't want to go to the store yeah can i borrow a gpu and it'd be like yeah i don't take one of the
[3344.76 --> 3348.68]  ones we need for this review on tuesday yeah i need these ones it's like okay i'll grab some other
[3348.68 --> 3354.36]  ones yeah it used to be pretty loosey it was pretty fluid but that was that was a really so the stuff
[3354.36 --> 3359.40]  that i have is going to be like ancient i would say these days the vast majority of what i'm memeing on
[3359.40 --> 3365.88]  on camera i am memeing on yeah it's it's mostly the yeah it's mostly going to be the really old stuff
[3367.88 --> 3371.88]  this is why luke hasn't gotten an upgrade yet says bell in the chat yeah i love it every day
[3374.60 --> 3376.04]  every day i'm upgrading
[3378.12 --> 3382.28]  sorry um right so i had wanted to come back to the labs website for a second here oh
[3382.28 --> 3389.24]  because we also have the written version of that video yeah which i didn't mention before so you
[3389.24 --> 3396.28]  know that's pretty cool so it's it's just like we want to make it so that this work that we're doing
[3396.28 --> 3403.08]  is digestible easily by as many people as possible so we have the written version which is as deep as
[3403.08 --> 3408.44]  it's going to get basically and then there's also the video version for people that don't like reading
[3408.44 --> 3413.32]  stuff yep depending on uh you know what part of the world you live in you might be more interested
[3413.32 --> 3419.48]  in 115 volt versus uh 230 volt power excursion productivity might also be easier for you to
[3419.48 --> 3425.00]  just like google translate the labs website yeah that way yeah exactly uh so we got that there and
[3425.00 --> 3434.44]  then this is really cool they also did and this is uh co-authored by oni um our test technician and
[3434.44 --> 3444.44]  lucas who is our power supply uh wizard um that is to help you power up your knowledge and it's basically
[3444.44 --> 3451.00]  a how to how to watch how to read cool right where they go through our graphing formats kind of explain
[3451.56 --> 3457.40]  why we've laid them out the way that we have how to interpret them uh what matters what doesn't uh
[3457.40 --> 3464.12]  this oh man this was this was an entire probably half an hour to 45 minutes of a meeting
[3464.44 --> 3472.20]  this this graph and uh breaking the sine wave and the interruption during the brown out off onto this
[3472.20 --> 3478.68]  separate graph um and i i got to make one of my best jokes ever in a meeting that i think i already
[3478.68 --> 3482.76]  alluded to on wanshow before so i won't make the rest of you suffer yeah i thought that was wrong hold
[3482.76 --> 3489.08]  on one sec i think i think you slipped uh oni's title is senior content writer not technician oh sorry sorry
[3489.08 --> 3492.12]  sorry right it right right yep thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you sorry sorry sorry sorry
[3492.12 --> 3495.48]  um he was just focusing on the next thing he was going to say it's
[3497.72 --> 3507.00]  sorry oni yeah enjoy your gpu that you got consolation prize something yeah she was in a video oh yeah
[3507.00 --> 3513.88]  she was oh yeah yeah no i saw that i saw um that's a pretty sick consolation yeah i know right um
[3513.88 --> 3520.52]  um anywho so yeah there was a there was a lot of debate about this graph um and like you know how
[3520.52 --> 3524.60]  to make it more readable so yeah we gave a lot of thought to it and if you guys want to know what
[3524.60 --> 3530.20]  the thinking was and how to interpret it this is a really great primer on how to understand if a power
[3530.20 --> 3540.12]  supply is any good very exciting okay what do you want to talk about next uh we're off merch messages
[3540.12 --> 3544.68]  right we're doing other topics i want to talk about what the paper says yeah yeah yeah i want to talk
[3544.68 --> 3550.84]  about i just read what's on the prompter you san diego the arm windows revolution might come packed
[3550.84 --> 3556.60]  with a privacy nightmare oh i know right okay all right do the thing this was this was the topic that
[3556.60 --> 3560.76]  hit me this week i i dove into this a little bit but i'm going to read these notes first and then
[3560.76 --> 3566.52]  i'll tangent into whatever i'm thinking of uh this week microsoft officially unveiled its new lineup of
[3566.52 --> 3575.32]  laptops featuring qualcomm's 12 core snapdragon x elite and 10 core snapdragon x plus chips all of
[3575.32 --> 3581.08]  which are based on arm that's like the big drop here these laptops reportedly have a battery life of
[3581.08 --> 3591.24]  17 to 20 hours and several apparently outperform an m3 macbook air acer asus dell hp in speron i thought
[3591.24 --> 3597.56]  it was hp in speron is in speron a different brand uh in speron is a dell brand so i don't know
[3597.56 --> 3603.96]  don't worry about it samsung and lenovo have likewise announced new snapdrag powered lap snapdrag
[3603.96 --> 3610.92]  snapdragon powered laptops um laptop lineups as well these laptops will launch with native arm versions of
[3610.92 --> 3619.24]  adobe photoshop lightroom firefly and express it's an interesting setup to not have premiere but it does
[3619.24 --> 3624.84]  say with premiere and illustrator coming later in the summer microsoft is no longer calling these ai
[3624.84 --> 3633.96]  pcs instead calling them copilot plus pcs which really makes me think of uh gnu plus linux but
[3633.96 --> 3639.96]  anyways um the company is heavily emphasizing their ai capabilities including uncontroversial features
[3639.96 --> 3647.88]  like ai upscaling but all it's not completely uncontroversial but sure um but also a recall feature
[3647.88 --> 3653.40]  this is the one that stood out to me uh that has raised some concerns among uh i almost said
[3653.40 --> 3661.64]  piracy among privacy advocates recall gives copilot a kind of literal photographic memory by taking an
[3661.64 --> 3669.16]  automatic screenshot every three seconds this would store around three months of a user's recent activity
[3669.16 --> 3675.24]  by default according to microsoft the feature can be turned on or off and these snapshots which
[3675.24 --> 3681.24]  the vast majority of windows users will never turn it off because the vast majority of windows users
[3681.24 --> 3686.76]  never go into settings and change anything so keep that in mind uh so you might most people won't um
[3687.64 --> 3693.16]  these snapshots are encrypted and stored locally and may be deleted at any time further users can
[3693.16 --> 3698.60]  create blacklists that prevent recall from taking screenshots when certain apps or websites
[3698.60 --> 3707.32]  are open likewise these images are tied to specific user profiles on the device critics however have
[3707.32 --> 3713.40]  expressed concern that the feature could still wind up capturing sensitive information because of course
[3713.40 --> 3718.76]  it could which might be abused by someone with access to the device especially if a person unknowingly
[3718.76 --> 3725.48]  borrows a device or uses a public device with this feature enabled the uk's information commissioner's
[3725.48 --> 3731.96]  office has announced that it will be making inquiries into potential security issues posed by the feature
[3733.00 --> 3740.52]  i mean this is one of those topics where we read the thing and then i think we basically go that's bad yeah
[3742.28 --> 3750.52]  yeah yeah yeah um elijah in chat who i don't like acknowledging because he's supposed to be working
[3750.52 --> 3756.44]  but it's after hours so i guess it's fine elijah says for his amd ultimate tech upgrade which by the
[3756.44 --> 3766.52]  way is coming oh he's gonna switch to linux over this feature oh you know what oh i don't even blame
[3766.52 --> 3771.80]  him based even though you can turn it off it's like yeah you can turn it off now and then windows will
[3771.80 --> 3777.72]  update and i'll turn it back on and it won't tell you and we've seen it time and time and time and time
[3777.72 --> 3784.28]  again and you know what i i think with man with the with the way that things are developing right
[3784.28 --> 3791.48]  now man that's so based on game compatibility on linux um my understanding and i haven't talked to
[3791.48 --> 3796.84]  emily about this much but i have a little bit because she's been pushing me to do another steam
[3796.84 --> 3801.96]  os gaming check-in or not steam os uh gaming on linux check-in okay because it's been a little while and
[3801.96 --> 3806.04]  i kept saying look i want to do it when steam os gets released broadly and she's all like yeah but like
[3806.04 --> 3810.04]  is that ever going to happen i i've been like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now i'm not i don't know
[3810.04 --> 3815.80]  who knows good question yeah it's a good question so anyway we're gonna do it um but from from that
[3815.80 --> 3820.12]  conversation she was basically saying yeah and nvidia driver support is looking like it's like
[3820.76 --> 3829.32]  gonna get a lot better like like soon like like they care um dude like is linux going to be
[3829.32 --> 3839.08]  the gaming operating system wait and windows becomes the like or like is linux going to be the
[3839.08 --> 3845.80]  like the x86 gaming operating system and is windows i mean looking how hard microsoft is pushing are they
[3845.80 --> 3853.08]  going to become like the arm the the arm productivity you know operating system the mobile like laptop only
[3853.08 --> 3859.80]  operating system computers and here's what's really confusing to me about this is why is microsoft so
[3859.80 --> 3865.96]  focused on beating the macbook oh dude what's the is apple's market share even this interview
[3865.96 --> 3874.20]  opens with him talking i know i know the first line it mentions apple directly it's weird but here's the thing
[3874.20 --> 3887.08]  this is apple's market share according to statista 16 yeah so like what's the what are you doing so
[3887.08 --> 3896.04]  what it's like it's like intel at the the prime of their market share which is not that long ago but
[3896.04 --> 3901.80]  intel at the at the height the prime of their market share opening a new feature talk by naming amd
[3901.80 --> 3909.56]  why like what are you doing you already dominate it's weird i don't know man and i like
[3912.28 --> 3912.52]  yeah
[3915.32 --> 3922.84]  like dude oh apparently this is this is in the united states too so that's going to be way higher than it
[3922.84 --> 3931.08]  is worldwide yeah 100 and i get it they're they're competition or whatever else but at the end of the
[3931.08 --> 3939.96]  day you're you're kind of you're kind of chasing this this minority um this minority shareholder
[3940.52 --> 3947.96]  or not shareholder but a holder of market share i i i don't know and and you know what look it's
[3947.96 --> 3955.80]  capitalism baby you got to grow and taking some of apple like taking taking 10 like this is the thing
[3955.80 --> 3961.24]  if if they can take 10 of the sales that would have been a macbook okay they grow their market
[3961.24 --> 3967.80]  share in the us by 1.6 percent and i get it you gotta you gotta show growth but like do you even
[3967.80 --> 3972.76]  do you even think that this is the solution to that because i don't know i think the solution to that is
[3972.76 --> 3977.96]  is making really good ai stuff that works better on our processes convincing people to upgrade because
[3977.96 --> 3982.92]  people have we know that from the covet era people bought a bunch of stuff and they don't need to
[3982.92 --> 3986.52]  upgrade it because there's no point here comes a hot take so make things that are worth upgrading
[3986.52 --> 3991.16]  your hardware for you know what i think is happening right now i think that microsoft is contributing to
[3991.16 --> 3998.68]  a significant improvement in qualcomm mind share among computer buyers that is ultimately going to
[3998.68 --> 4005.00]  be exploited by google you ready for this you're falling back on your your chromebook thing chromebooks
[4005.88 --> 4011.56]  if you wanted a machine where battery life was of the utmost importance are you going to be running
[4011.56 --> 4020.44]  windows anyway no chrome os supports linux applications now chrome os supports steam
[4021.56 --> 4027.24]  gaming on linux is getting better all of these things are happening right now so is emily saying
[4027.24 --> 4031.64]  that there has been because i haven't looked so i'm not this is not this is not me countering to be
[4031.64 --> 4035.32]  super super clear before because you know the linux people can get a little advanced sometimes i'm not
[4035.32 --> 4041.16]  i'm not i'm not relaxed is emily saying that there's been significant steps since we did our challenge yeah
[4041.16 --> 4048.76]  because i would i would love to switch i love to switch it just wasn't quite there
[4050.84 --> 4057.08]  if it's there i'm gone because honestly i don't mind windows at all i actually kind of like windows 11
[4057.08 --> 4061.08]  in a lot of different ways and i know people hate windows 11 i don't care i enjoy it the things that i
[4061.08 --> 4068.04]  don't like are this snapshot thing them when you update windows them overriding some of your settings
[4068.04 --> 4074.04]  and changing things forcing ads into my operating system go away and then making search just the
[4074.04 --> 4079.40]  worst thing in the world those things are the only things i actually dislike a lot of what windows done
[4079.40 --> 4084.68]  windows search is the worst thing in the world all right maybe exaggerate a little bit but the the
[4084.68 --> 4090.68]  ads is too far this snapshot thing which you know it's going to turn itself back on is too far uh and
[4090.68 --> 4095.00]  the search being trash and constantly searching the internet when i want it to search local and it's
[4095.00 --> 4100.60]  even when you tell it to only search local now it just can't find things yeah which is crazy
[4102.04 --> 4108.28]  there's no reason for that so like i yeah i'd love to bail out i really like mint actually i like using mint
[4108.28 --> 4115.96]  my biggest problem is constantly jumping back and forth for applications mostly games and some
[4115.96 --> 4123.48]  applications is just really annoying i want an operating system that can do my stuff i'm excited
[4124.20 --> 4130.36]  i uh i i think i think the the age of the chromebook is dawning you're excited about chromebook
[4130.92 --> 4137.72]  well it's linux it's kind of cut down linux so you so you think by chromebook taking over linux
[4137.72 --> 4143.64]  will become stronger because of more contribution look at the trajectory of chrome os chrome os started
[4143.64 --> 4150.12]  wild super super locked down basically only ran chrome it started out with all the devices having
[4150.12 --> 4155.08]  completely locked down firmware so you couldn't even install a different operating system if you wanted to
[4156.52 --> 4165.48]  now you can run android apps on it you can run linux apps on it i believe some of them have um some of them
[4167.72 --> 4173.16]  that's not going to allow to allow alternate operating system installs uh by default don't quote me on that
[4173.16 --> 4178.20]  last one we did a video on this recently so i'm it's kind of in my brain but has fallen out a little bit
[4178.20 --> 4189.48]  um i think that if google is smart this is their opportunity kids grow up using chrome os
[4190.76 --> 4198.20]  millions and millions and millions of kids grow up using chrome os and so all chrome os has to do is
[4199.00 --> 4205.80]  keep getting a little more functional now google is also a tech giant like microsoft and is absolutely
[4206.44 --> 4212.28]  capable of succumbing to the same hubris as microsoft and just screwing up chrome os and making it so
[4212.28 --> 4219.24]  bad that we couldn't possibly switch to it but no i absolutely do believe that linux is the beneficiary
[4219.24 --> 4227.40]  of chrome os gaining more popularity and chrome os stands to be a beneficiary of linux gaining better
[4227.40 --> 4233.32]  support and gaining better access to applications people want to run yeah 100 percent one thing that's
[4233.32 --> 4240.60]  interesting is is as based as as elijah's move is and as much as if if significant improvements have
[4240.60 --> 4246.68]  been made i would yet again be happy to consider it at least i don't think most gamers are going to care
[4247.40 --> 4253.56]  what about productivity i think workplaces are going to stay on windows for the foreseeable future that's
[4253.56 --> 4261.72]  my problem yeah like we can't want we can't run wanshow on linux unfortunately yeah yeah there's
[4261.72 --> 4267.16]  what doesn't work okay so that's an interesting one handyman uh in floatplane chat linked me something
[4267.16 --> 4275.08]  that is pretty cool which is uh works on woa.com and then in this particular instance slash games
[4275.80 --> 4282.44]  and i go to my laptop you can search the games that are that will work on windows 100 asian cats i have no
[4282.44 --> 4288.84]  idea some game okay norp analog i know the norp analog yeah that's fun yeah i like that okay so
[4288.84 --> 4294.12]  like some of these you've seen the amount of games on steam right there's gonna be some weird names
[4294.12 --> 4300.12]  i'm not i'm not talking about the the there's seven ways to die i don't know that's a game
[4303.00 --> 4308.36]  i haven't heard of a lot of these but it is what it is but yeah there's there's already sites popping up
[4308.36 --> 4314.36]  like this what's what's the home page what else is on here oh just games cool um can you can you
[4314.36 --> 4319.00]  sort by like category popular like games you've heard of is that a thing or okay
[4322.12 --> 4326.60]  looks pretty bare bones for now but um yeah in the long term maybe it's still be oh well there's
[4326.60 --> 4332.20]  there's 1348 results i'm expecting they're not all tagged properly that makes sense um so the the
[4332.20 --> 4336.76]  category stuff is probably not working great but interesting site you could what do you want to search for how about that
[4336.76 --> 4341.88]  that um let's go with dark souls
[4346.92 --> 4347.16]  cool
[4353.56 --> 4359.64]  hmm close it got rain i mean it's better than windows search it's just extremely fuzzy fuzzy search
[4359.64 --> 4369.56]  it's comfy blanket search um yeah i don't know that's that's neat but it's coming along i i just
[4373.16 --> 4381.80]  i don't like this i care i appreciate that it's stored locally yeah but some of the stuff stored
[4381.80 --> 4387.88]  locally does not mean secure encrypted does not mean secure the argument nothing is impenetrable
[4387.88 --> 4390.84]  nothing is fully secure do you hear the argument for why we should be okay with it
[4392.52 --> 4398.04]  because this is all just coming anyway and we should just kind of deal with it everyone's going
[4398.04 --> 4403.24]  to have an equivalent thing like man we're talking about them having capabilities like i forgot my my
[4403.24 --> 4410.60]  my password for my for my mobile operators you know online portal what is it um cortana yeah
[4410.60 --> 4420.44]  you can't be you can't be storing that stuff yeah it's sketch yeah this interview on bloomberg television
[4421.00 --> 4429.24]  um i think this is the interview at least at some point in time the interviewer asks satya nadella
[4429.24 --> 4435.64]  is this it yeah i think so i'm not 100 certain this is the right one but i think it is um at some point in
[4435.64 --> 4442.36]  time in the video uh she asks him like this is kind of creepy basically and he responds with
[4442.36 --> 4447.00]  effectively what linus just said which is like i don't know ai stuff is going to be like this so
[4447.72 --> 4453.32]  get used to it not obviously not exactly that very pr he words missed it quite a bit better than that
[4453.32 --> 4460.04]  yes but that's basically i'm not nominating you for new ceo of microsoft although they might go in a
[4460.04 --> 4464.28]  good direction with you at the helm i don't know if they'd make money though uh probably not yeah yeah
[4464.28 --> 4473.24]  um oh uh question syncplane asks hey can you ask dan again what doesn't work on linux for wanshow
[4473.24 --> 4479.64]  uh yeah i'm very curious about that oh that's uh the vmix yeah that's basically just vmix yeah um it
[4479.64 --> 4486.76]  uses too much of the windows libraries for especially because almost all of it is gpu um it's very very
[4486.76 --> 4491.56]  stable because it's a pretty much 100 gpu compute someone's this is this is one of the problems that we
[4491.56 --> 4498.44]  run into and now i'm gonna piss all the linux people off um so there's a couple things we start
[4498.44 --> 4503.32]  talking about how we could we could maybe adopt linux again and floatplane chat erupts with you
[4503.32 --> 4508.68]  should use this distro with this thing and this blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that's that's scary
[4508.68 --> 4516.20]  for new users and then the other one is tell me the software that didn't work because they know some
[4516.20 --> 4521.80]  way to magically get it to function in some way somehow yeah i'm running it on metal i'm not going
[4521.80 --> 4526.68]  to emulate an operating system underneath it yeah yeah there's always there's always that one
[4526.68 --> 4530.60]  program and it stops working and then we want to go live on wanshow but it doesn't work so you have
[4530.60 --> 4535.40]  to tinker with linux to make it function it's like yeah it needs to be or we could just spend a hundred
[4535.40 --> 4541.32]  dollars on a windows license yeah this is windows 11 that has vmix installed on it and chrome this
[4541.32 --> 4547.88]  that is all that is on this computer this is why business i don't really see them moving um and and
[4547.88 --> 4553.48]  at home as well like there's always that one program that i need to be using that doesn't exist you had a
[4553.48 --> 4559.56]  rough day at work driving home three different people cut cut you off someone scraped the side of
[4559.56 --> 4565.96]  your car you're upset you go get some coffee and you spill it and you finally get home you just want
[4565.96 --> 4568.52]  to play video games and you sit on your computer and they won't work for some reason
[4568.52 --> 4575.80]  and it happened a lot guys i think if you're being honest with yourselves
[4577.24 --> 4581.96]  it doesn't bother you because you enjoy the tinkering there is tinkering which is great which
[4581.96 --> 4587.16]  is fine fantastic i have lots of things that i do the hard way because i enjoy it i don't have to
[4587.16 --> 4593.80]  paint my own motorcycle believe it or not i'm doing it i have pictures i was gonna say speaking of which
[4593.80 --> 4601.48]  i put i put white on it nice um primer nope nope it's primed gray um but the frame needs to be
[4601.48 --> 4608.44]  painted white because the pink that's going to go over top of it um doesn't shine through as brightly
[4608.44 --> 4613.56]  uh if it just goes on gray primer i apparently don't have pictures of it so forget that how much
[4613.56 --> 4621.88]  longer do you think the paint shop keeps telling me today bro don't tell me today like tell me tomorrow
[4621.88 --> 4627.56]  give yourself some wiggle room for for seven or eight business days they've been telling me i'll
[4627.56 --> 4634.52]  have it for you today is it today or is it i don't know yeah it doesn't matter sometimes sometimes you
[4634.52 --> 4639.40]  have the best intentions and i know i'm just i'm waiting on the mid coat and the effect coat and then
[4639.40 --> 4644.52]  i can do the whole thing like i'm i'm ready to paint that's exciting yeah i'm really excited
[4644.52 --> 4651.88]  someone said yeah it's also perfectly okay to only partially move to something if it doesn't work i
[4651.88 --> 4654.84]  hear that but then like i said earlier in the show like i don't want to be switching between
[4654.84 --> 4660.20]  operating systems all the time why are we training up our level one technicians on two operating systems
[4660.20 --> 4665.72]  yeah no no man we got grub on the computers now and like oh you make a mistake and now now you won't
[4665.72 --> 4672.28]  boot and i've dealt with that before i used to i used to triple boot between osx uh windows and
[4672.28 --> 4678.92]  linux on one machine uh back when you could do the hackintosh stuff yeah well i work for you
[4680.12 --> 4688.04]  obviously that's why we hired you yeah it sucks i just want to go home and and not do work basically
[4688.04 --> 4694.20]  there's there's some significant bumps to get over still i'm sure those are i mean i haven't touched in
[4694.20 --> 4700.84]  a long time i'm sure those are still problems um but you know the more bumps microsoft puts in front
[4700.84 --> 4706.36]  of windows eventually those roads might start looking pretty similar and when they do i think
[4706.36 --> 4718.60]  linux starts to win so yeah time to use sponsors yeah
[4722.92 --> 4727.00]  all right sorry i'm just gonna have to get this sponsor out of my mouth i actually don't think they

[4913.16 --> 4918.84]  that was the worst the dancing cow was pretty great though that was a dancing baby i don't what year is
[4918.84 --> 4927.88]  it i don't think it one-upped uh me apparently being dan's dad yeah it was a little weird um is it too late
[4927.88 --> 4933.32]  for an abortion like why does he have a beard i came out to the womb with that bearded baby
[4933.32 --> 4943.00]  oh boy what do you want to do next three merch messages oh yeah right sorry yes dan yes yes sir
[4943.00 --> 4949.32]  sure okay sir uh having trouble balancing work and time with my partner she says we compromised on
[4949.32 --> 4955.96]  shared time too much but i made two-thirds versus last year i work odd hours to get overtime but get three
[4955.96 --> 4965.32]  days off advice three days off is a lot right but do those hours always coincide with her time off
[4965.32 --> 4970.68]  because yeah if you have three days off but you spend two of them like gaming in your cave and and
[4970.68 --> 4974.44]  to be clear i'm not saying you're doing that i'm just saying three days off does not necessarily
[4974.44 --> 4976.44]  equate to three days together totally
[4976.44 --> 4985.08]  i mean that's a tough one you gotta you gotta make time uh relationships do not autopilot you
[4985.08 --> 4991.40]  also need to set realistic expectations because as they said i made two-thirds versus last year
[4991.96 --> 4999.64]  economic times are tough right now you can't just like not push i mean i remember we talked to we
[4999.64 --> 5003.72]  well not we didn't talk about it but we alluded to it last week when yvonne was on the show with us
[5003.72 --> 5009.88]  um where yeah yeah we had some really tough conversations and what i often fell back on in
[5009.88 --> 5015.40]  fact you know being across the hall from us and those with those paper thin walls uh what i often
[5015.40 --> 5019.16]  you've probably heard me say this before but what i often alluded to was that that old expression
[5019.16 --> 5025.56]  sometimes they would go downstairs to like the living room area thinking that it did anything anyway
[5026.12 --> 5032.12]  um i often would talk about making hay while the sun's shining yes like that's a
[5032.12 --> 5037.48]  if you have a good opportunity now but then you also can't like depending on your financial situation
[5037.48 --> 5041.88]  you might not if the sun's no longer shining you might not have an opportunity to not do it
[5041.88 --> 5045.32]  you might just have to make hay anyway i mean the answer is kind of the same either way i guess is like
[5045.32 --> 5050.84]  yeah at the end of the day work is our modern equivalent of going out and foraging for food and
[5050.84 --> 5058.76]  building shelter um and like if we don't do it we don't eat and we don't have shelter and there are
[5058.76 --> 5064.68]  alternatives you could be a mountain man and you guys could go to the mountain and you could forage
[5064.68 --> 5073.64]  for food and build shelter um but what i suspect is that she doesn't want to do that um i mean maybe
[5074.20 --> 5080.36]  maybe in which case i hope you're ready for some significant lifestyle adjustments might be sick you
[5080.36 --> 5086.60]  won't be watching wan show much from out there i don't think a little tough um yeah it's tough i mean
[5086.60 --> 5091.56]  i think the the most important thing in any relationship in any conflict is you got to
[5091.56 --> 5098.76]  communicate you both got to communicate okay what are my needs what are your needs what are the realistic
[5099.72 --> 5107.24]  um challenges that we face to uh to meet both of them and what's the closest that we can get to a
[5107.24 --> 5112.60]  middle ground yeah and like you you're pointing out yourself i made two-thirds versus last year
[5112.60 --> 5119.08]  uh she might not be as financially minded or financially focused um i find there's usually
[5119.08 --> 5125.72]  like one person in the relationship that is more so like for for for you ivan is more financially
[5125.72 --> 5133.80]  focused i think um she's better at it which is i'll say that much probably good um but i okay man this
[5133.80 --> 5138.28]  is this is one of those things where i feel like in in trying to make sure that people properly
[5138.28 --> 5143.08]  appreciate that ivan is not just the boss's wife and take your wife to work day i i have talked a
[5143.08 --> 5148.76]  lot about how good she is at that kind of stuff guys don't kid yourself i'm not some idiot like
[5150.44 --> 5156.68]  i i know how to budget things and stuff so i was yeah i was memeing on you but i yeah i know well
[5156.68 --> 5160.44]  the problem is that they don't know that yeah there seems to it's fair enough there seem to be a
[5160.44 --> 5165.88]  lot of people that when i build someone else up and i kind of have like i have kind of a self-deprecating
[5165.88 --> 5177.48]  style of humor um people seem to take it at face value which uh well hey anyway i see you and that's
[5177.48 --> 5184.92]  okay my my literal friends my my point was is it it might be a good idea to sit down with the books
[5185.48 --> 5194.36]  with her try to explain or with them uh try to explain uh oh no it says she okay yeah with her um
[5194.36 --> 5200.04]  um try to explain like this this is why okay i made two-thirds versus last year these are my
[5200.04 --> 5205.24]  financial goals over the next while which will put us in these financial positions where you know
[5205.24 --> 5211.56]  retirement might be more comfy we might be able to uh i don't know rent a better place or buy a better
[5211.56 --> 5217.32]  place or buy a place at all or do whatever have more insulate financial insulation if something bad
[5217.32 --> 5222.12]  happens say one of us loses a job this will give us more of a runway like explain all of these different
[5222.12 --> 5226.92]  types of things but if i could give a little bit of advice don't mansplain it ask questions totally
[5226.92 --> 5234.12]  ask questions like in the event that one of us lost a job how long would you expect us to take to
[5234.12 --> 5239.56]  get a new job and how much of what we're making now would we be willing to settle for so you can ask a
[5239.56 --> 5244.28]  question like that layout a scenario and then do the math together rather than doing it all ahead of
[5244.28 --> 5249.72]  time and basically giving a presentation because that can that can have a little bit of the ick totally that
[5249.72 --> 5253.32]  makes sense yeah yeah work with them on it i don't know
[5256.12 --> 5260.92]  i'm showing my seven-year-old some games from my own childhood for example roller coaster tycoon
[5260.92 --> 5267.96]  worms and age of empires 2. how has your children responded to older games like these as they grew
[5267.96 --> 5277.48]  older did uh any really get into some um i haven't i haven't played older games with my kids that much
[5278.12 --> 5283.80]  but what i will say is they tend to enjoy things the most when you do it with them so if you just
[5283.80 --> 5288.28]  give them roller coaster tycoon and walk away i doubt that's going to be very effective but if you sit
[5288.28 --> 5295.48]  and make coasters with them that will be super effective um like uh my son would never pick up liaro
[5295.48 --> 5302.84]  on his own like he doesn't he could um but he loves playing it with me so that's that's the kind of thing
[5302.84 --> 5306.20]  you got to do right if you if you want them to kind of enjoy the same things as you and you want
[5306.20 --> 5310.52]  to kind of make that connection just make sure that you understand it has to go both ways i've had to
[5310.52 --> 5317.00]  spend more time than i otherwise would have playing minecraft dungeons um because my kids like it and
[5318.36 --> 5324.04]  it's what it's like it's diablo right like it's it's a stupid just click on everything dungeon crawler
[5324.04 --> 5327.80]  game right like and and to be clear if you enjoy minecraft dungeons that's fine there's good
[5327.80 --> 5333.24]  gameplay mechanics and i'm sure at like a high level you can be good at it and stuff it's not just
[5333.24 --> 5338.84]  click on things or whatever like some of the raids are pretty challenging and like we got wiped and
[5338.84 --> 5345.88]  stuff so no disrespect intended it's just not really my genre and um i've played a lot more of it than
[5345.88 --> 5353.24]  i would have if my kids hadn't asked me to right and let's see what's our last one here hello
[5353.24 --> 5361.16]  daluli i recently sent my 89 civic hatchback into a tree at 35 miles an hour a day before i went on
[5361.16 --> 5366.84]  vacation have you had anything catastrophic happen before an event but found a way to go anyway
[5368.36 --> 5378.76]  what a specific question oh no um oh before an event i mean i'm sure i've had something terrible
[5378.76 --> 5383.00]  happen before an event i mean you get sick anytime you go anywhere so that's kind of catastrophic yeah i'm
[5383.00 --> 5386.76]  worried remember that time you went to japan and then just stayed in your hotel room the whole time
[5386.76 --> 5392.28]  that was taiwan taiwan sure whatever that's where i'm going again nice hopefully i'll get sick again
[5392.28 --> 5397.56]  i thought you also had to stay in your hotel room a lot in japan yes yeah so i'm not wrong so well
[5397.56 --> 5402.04]  that's uh i have you like i haven't not been so i gotta be like that why am i being so defensive right now
[5404.04 --> 5410.44]  i haven't not been sick during a vacation for three years nice and we're rolling the dice again nice
[5411.00 --> 5414.20]  seeing how it goes yeah yeah yeah maybe it'll work out you got
[5416.52 --> 5421.80]  i'm not sick don't worry thanks unless i am oh we'll find out soon yeah i mean it'll affect me too
[5421.80 --> 5430.12]  i guess let's hope neither of us is sick yes um i don't know it's happened a bunch of times tell me this
[5430.84 --> 5436.68]  i don't really want to give examples tell me this okay now obviously i'm not going to ask you if you're
[5436.68 --> 5444.52]  gonna wear a cloth square on your face but would you consider using one of the like organic particulate
[5444.52 --> 5449.32]  filters like i have for my painting booth would you consider wearing one of those on the plane
[5449.32 --> 5455.56]  because close quarters on a plane look i don't i don't give a if you believe that covid was a
[5455.56 --> 5461.96]  government conspiracy or whatever i i actually don't care uh the the cold hard truth is that
[5462.60 --> 5468.52]  proximity especially over an extended period of time to people who are infected with any kind of
[5468.52 --> 5476.52]  even remotely airborne illness increases the chances of you getting sick stop if you're gonna say anything
[5476.52 --> 5480.84]  other than that being near sick people makes you sick you're actually stupid and you can go away
[5481.32 --> 5488.20]  um so if you were to wear like a real filtering mask if that was an option because it is they're like
[5488.20 --> 5492.92]  100 bucks and the cartridges are much cheaper they're like interchangeable cartridges yeah i have
[5492.92 --> 5497.88]  i have one i used to use it for working with cement how badly do you not want to get sick
[5499.08 --> 5505.96]  i think not badly enough to wear that which is funny because yeah why i actually find them who cares
[5506.84 --> 5512.20]  wildly more comfortable to wear yeah they're not that uncomfortable but people like hate it
[5512.20 --> 5520.04]  so much i don't know why i tried it before when this whole thing first popped off my immediate
[5520.04 --> 5526.60]  reaction was to go get my old like cement mask thing yeah because i'm like they have removable filters
[5526.60 --> 5534.36]  i'll just buy the n95 ones because those exist and you can just click them in and then i'm good right and
[5534.36 --> 5539.72]  the whole world was like no we have to use these really annoying one size fits all they don't fit your
[5539.72 --> 5545.24]  head they're going to literally cut your ears masks and i'm like why why like when i when i'm on planes
[5545.24 --> 5550.28]  you know what i actually do yeah i wear those old noise cancelling headphones that you got for us
[5552.12 --> 5558.68]  2014 i don't even remember i don't remember when you bought everybody noise cancelling headphones for
[5558.68 --> 5565.80]  trips like a billion years ago okay i still i still have those and i i hook the mask around those
[5565.80 --> 5571.56]  so that it doesn't cut into my ears because if i don't i i've actually bled from masks before
[5571.56 --> 5578.12]  wow my head's too big i 30 printed a bunch of um ear saver it's so annoying and i'm the one with the ego
[5580.68 --> 5587.32]  you have you have that makes sense i did it for that was um during covet they were the blood people
[5587.32 --> 5591.80]  the bloodletting people i can't remember they're called like life labs and stuff like that oh
[5591.80 --> 5597.96]  the bloodletting people you mean the clinic yeah the clinic where they let your blood go into the
[5597.96 --> 5605.96]  tubes do you call your doctor a sawbones it'd be funny it'd be very funny doctor sawbones please i
[5605.96 --> 5611.96]  have the i have the vapors um and those worked really well because they were having to wear masks
[5611.96 --> 5617.48]  like for like 10 12 hours a day and they were all bleeding as well so you could try one of those
[5617.48 --> 5621.80]  although they'd probably be pretty silly i don't know what happened i used to i used to get sick
[5623.00 --> 5628.20]  decently often enough that it was annoying but it would always be for like really short periods of
[5628.20 --> 5633.32]  time and it was like usually pretty easy like i would get sick on like a thursday or a friday and
[5633.32 --> 5637.00]  i'd be better again by the time i'm back in work on monday and i'd like lose a weekend and it would
[5637.00 --> 5643.16]  suck but like it didn't really matter and now i'll get sick and it just doesn't go away for so long
[5643.16 --> 5650.36]  and like the most recent two of them i tested and they weren't coveted so like it's just something
[5650.36 --> 5658.12]  i have no idea i don't know man i um for me the uh i i don't wear a mask anymore because we don't have
[5658.12 --> 5662.84]  mandates and lockdowns and there's you know there's there's a lot more certainty about uh
[5662.84 --> 5668.20]  uh covet and its various uh its various changes over the years and all of that so i'm i'm a lot less
[5668.20 --> 5673.24]  worried about it um i mean it's it's the unknown that was that was the reason for a lot of the
[5673.24 --> 5677.72]  protective measures we didn't know you know what it was going to do we didn't know what the impacts
[5677.72 --> 5684.44]  were going to be long term um so i don't i don't wear a mask anymore but what i do still do is i wash
[5684.44 --> 5691.48]  my hands way more than i used to that's a new one for me i never get sick anymore think about it when's
[5691.48 --> 5695.88]  the last time you saw me miss a day of work because i'm sick yeah like basically never remember and in
[5695.88 --> 5700.76]  the old days i used to work anyway but i'd you go back to some of the old videos and i'm like i'm
[5700.76 --> 5706.68]  hosting it like this because i have no voice and stuff dude i never get sick anymore washing your
[5706.68 --> 5711.16]  hands more and it's not like i was like a dirty gross disgusting person before anything like i wash my
[5711.16 --> 5718.04]  hands when i use the bathroom and stuff like that but i switched my mentality i used to wash my hands
[5718.04 --> 5725.08]  whenever i did something dirty now i wash my hands before i'm about to do something that requires
[5725.08 --> 5732.52]  cleanliness yes and also that yeah and that has made probably the biggest difference out of every
[5733.16 --> 5736.68]  behavioral i'm also really hardcore about um
[5739.24 --> 5743.40]  when i go to the gym i'm really hardcore about not touching my face with my hands
[5744.44 --> 5749.24]  sometimes i might you know there's sweat or whatever i'll use like my arm i'll do it but i'll
[5749.24 --> 5753.40]  make sure that i've washed my hands first well i'll do that but then at the gym you're touching
[5753.40 --> 5758.76]  things in the gym there's no way yeah so i i i pre-wipe down every surface that i use in the gym
[5758.76 --> 5765.00]  including bars like barbells whatever else and then even despite that if i need to touch my face
[5765.00 --> 5770.04]  i'll use like you know you you do this with your hands so you can have a point with this part of the
[5770.04 --> 5774.44]  wrist and then i'll like use that if i need to or just my the whole back of my arm or whatever like
[5774.44 --> 5780.52]  i'll find some way to not use the inside of my hand that i'm touching things with unique username
[5780.52 --> 5785.80]  reminds me that you just had a uti linus sorry for the reminder i did uh but that's not related to
[5785.80 --> 5794.28]  yeah transmissible although there there are person to person transmission things that can cause a uti
[5794.28 --> 5803.16]  which actually reminds me of the time that my doctor in front of me basically told yvonne oh honey he's
[5803.16 --> 5811.80]  cheating on you have i never told you this story no um what anyway antibiotics they're a miracle i'm
[5811.80 --> 5815.16]  fine now thank you um as far as the uti goes oh
[5815.16 --> 5817.16]  oh
[5821.56 --> 5830.52]  oh no but i got um i got an unrelated blood test for something what's happening i got okay i got an
[5830.52 --> 5837.00]  i got an unrelated blood test for something or other and uh i tested positive for i'm gonna get all the
[5837.00 --> 5843.56]  details wrong because i am not a no i'm not a doctor and it doesn't matter to me in my daily life but i i
[5843.56 --> 5853.40]  tested positive for like the the associated proteins or the antibodies or something of one of the
[5853.40 --> 5865.00]  hepatite eye um okay and basically whichever one it is it's one that you that is is sexually transmitted
[5865.00 --> 5871.80]  um so i went in for my for this totally unrelated blood test it was probably something to do with um
[5872.60 --> 5877.80]  getting my blood tested to figure out if i had arthritis because um i had these issues with
[5877.80 --> 5883.80]  inflammation in my knees and now they think it was juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so it's kind of
[5883.80 --> 5887.72]  gone in and gone into remission it'll probably come back with a vengeance when i'm old but for now i'm
[5887.72 --> 5892.52]  doing pretty great um anyway so i was i was probably in for a blood test for that or something
[5893.08 --> 5898.36]  and they basically go okay but you've got this like antigen or protein or something it was something to
[5898.36 --> 5904.76]  do with some one of the hepatitis is and um they basically i basically go okay so like what does
[5904.76 --> 5912.60]  that mean and they're basically like well it you know usually indicates that um you've you know
[5913.32 --> 5922.12]  gotten that you've had at some point uh uh this this sexually transmitted disease and yvonne pipes up and she
[5922.12 --> 5929.16]  goes okay but he hasn't because i don't and i never have and she kind of goes
[5932.84 --> 5939.24]  well that's how you get it so i think you guys might have to have a conversation about this
[5942.60 --> 5947.88]  and look for me and yvonne it's perfectly normal and acceptable for us to have a meeting with with our
[5947.88 --> 5954.20]  doctor like with each other but for her to basically like and it really was that obvious
[5955.00 --> 5960.84]  um now so we left like obviously yvonne and i have a lot of trust in our relationship because as we were
[5960.84 --> 5970.04]  leaving um i was like um no and she's like yeah i know um but yvonne having a background in pharmacy
[5970.04 --> 5975.00]  having an actual medical background herself oh man that's something that i think it's gotta be useful
[5975.00 --> 5983.32]  makes me more angry than almost anything else like and i i don't know what it is i don't know if it's
[5983.32 --> 5989.16]  the general you know arrogance that you can see with doctors sometimes i don't know if it's like a
[5989.16 --> 5998.76]  misogyny thing i don't know what it is but the number the number of times that i have had to stand
[5998.76 --> 6006.04]  there while a medical professional talks down to yvonne when she clearly understands everything that's
[6006.04 --> 6010.44]  going on very easily especially when they're talking about drugs for me to pipe in and go
[6011.40 --> 6018.76]  she's a pharmacist you don't have to explain what a corticosteroid is you can move on and for them to
[6018.76 --> 6025.32]  keep going through it explaining to her like she is three years old i don't think anything makes me more
[6025.32 --> 6030.28]  angry than that anyway so the point is this doctor who i probably have had that conversation with
[6030.28 --> 6035.72]  already because i understand these things pretty well whether it's from just paying attention in
[6035.72 --> 6043.64]  school or it's from taking some some first year biology classes or from doing flash cards with yvonne
[6043.64 --> 6047.64]  i've picked up a lot i don't i don't need to i don't need someone to explain to me what an
[6047.64 --> 6052.36]  anti-inflammatory is i don't need someone to explain to me what an nset is i like i i know what these
[6052.36 --> 6058.04]  things are and i you know i aren't you paid by the number of patients you see like let's let's do this
[6058.04 --> 6062.36]  thing right so i tend to kind of jump in with that she's a pharmacist you don't have to explain this
[6062.36 --> 6069.56]  she knows what aspirin is let's let's move on um anyway so yvonne starts asking probing questions
[6070.52 --> 6077.96]  so dismissive the doctor was so dismissive of her questions where she was basically probing for okay
[6077.96 --> 6082.68]  what are the other like the doctor was treating her like she was basically asking if she could get
[6082.68 --> 6087.48]  pregnant from a toilet seat you know like is that how he got it did he but what she was actually
[6087.48 --> 6093.00]  asking for is like okay look i'm a little rusty on the antigens versus the proteins versus the antibodies
[6093.00 --> 6098.76]  is there some other thing that could have caused that could have caused it and as it turns out
[6100.28 --> 6104.84]  when we went for another blood test and we came back for the results the doctor with no apology
[6104.84 --> 6109.56]  whatsoever for the incredibly awkward situation she'd created that could have in a different
[6109.56 --> 6115.48]  relationship caused a ruined it a pretty big stir okay because even if even if you did end up figuring
[6115.48 --> 6121.16]  out that it wasn't true irreparable damage could have been done no apology whatsoever is basically like
[6122.84 --> 6132.36]  yeah he like had he had some exposure to it at some point through a vaccine and had the the whatevers
[6132.36 --> 6141.40]  um but we didn't check for that last time so i didn't know you like you actually don't get to do
[6141.40 --> 6148.12]  that that's not cool and don't worry i have a new doctor now um that was a it was a clinic doctor i hate
[6148.12 --> 6153.40]  going to walk-in clinics it's basically but we didn't have a family doctor at that time between the two of
[6153.40 --> 6159.48]  us and my technically still my family doctor is like out in mission because he was my family doctor from
[6159.48 --> 6165.56]  before ivan and i like moved to not mission um so like i just didn't have one yet and i was super
[6165.56 --> 6171.16]  young and super healthy mine is super far away it's like 45 minutes yeah it sucks am i i the walk-in
[6171.16 --> 6176.44]  clinic four minutes from the office baby i lucked out that's pretty she's amazing that's awesome dude
[6176.44 --> 6181.48]  she tried to call me on a weekend about my results for the uti thing she like calls me on a saturday
[6181.48 --> 6185.88]  i don't pick up because i don't answer my phone because it's leaked a thousand times and i just give up on
[6185.88 --> 6191.48]  changing my phone number at this point um so she calls me on a saturday i don't pick up she texts me
[6191.48 --> 6196.04]  she's like yo i dealt with all your stuff go pick it up at this pharmacy it's the one near you i checked
[6196.68 --> 6207.00]  what holy crap she is she is absolutely based i love my doctor and she's like my age so i basically
[6207.00 --> 6214.84]  as long as she doesn't retire um dr t please please don't retire yeah as long as she doesn't retire
[6215.88 --> 6222.12]  i i i'm keeping her for life she's awesome yeah yeah yeah i the only at this point the only reason
[6222.12 --> 6227.08]  why i go into a walk-in is if i am a hundred percent confident what's going on i'll go in and like tell
[6227.08 --> 6230.84]  them and then they can get me whatever yeah a lot of time they'll argue with you anyway though
[6231.72 --> 6235.40]  honestly the one that i go to usually they just like verify really quick and they're like okay sure
[6235.40 --> 6239.24]  and then well that's pretty good because i have this problem i i've explained this to you before my like
[6239.24 --> 6243.56]  ear canals are kind of weird yeah i can't have the squishy in earbuds because they just fall out
[6243.56 --> 6249.96]  um i also sometimes have a hard time um when i get off of planes sometimes my ear just won't pop
[6250.84 --> 6255.72]  oh that's bad so i have to go in and like they help me do it oh that's rough so i'll just like tell
[6255.72 --> 6260.28]  them like this is the problem this is the way that you guys have successfully done it in the past and
[6260.28 --> 6263.88]  let us be like okay let us do that's pretty straightforward it's like cool man though like
[6263.88 --> 6269.40]  man visit walk-in doctors or just like any doctor that just like doesn't care um
[6269.40 --> 6276.04]  um it's such a it's kind of it's a scourge dude i agree but i get it here because here
[6276.60 --> 6281.24]  we have such an insane shortage so they have five minutes with you how are they going to care if they
[6281.24 --> 6284.52]  have five minutes i get it five minutes one question what are you going to how are you going
[6284.52 --> 6292.84]  to get invested in this person like i it sucks dr t please don't leave me yeah and some people are
[6292.84 --> 6297.32]  like time to switch doctors it's not that easy that's not that easy we have a significant shortage
[6297.32 --> 6302.20]  insane shortage she probably doesn't have open spots she probably has a system where family can
[6302.20 --> 6307.08]  get added on so any of these families that are growing that's her new clientele she can't bring
[6307.08 --> 6311.96]  on more people and it's really challenging because there's there's there's dynamics at play that are
[6311.96 --> 6316.76]  not as simple as just like oh i don't know why don't you guys substitute or substitute why don't you
[6316.76 --> 6322.04]  guys subsidize uh your your doctor training programs like it's not it's not that simple like if you
[6322.04 --> 6326.44]  a lot of the problem is that we have a brain drain down to the united states where doctors make a lot more
[6326.44 --> 6333.64]  money but a lot of the reasons that doctors make a lot more money is because of how bloated and uh
[6333.64 --> 6340.76]  broken the u.s medical system is like that whole you know here's your 30 band-aid thing that goes on
[6340.76 --> 6346.60]  where insurance companies um where there's where there's these outrageous fees that are being charged
[6346.60 --> 6351.96]  because insurance companies will just pay for it and then we'll just you know bilk their their
[6351.96 --> 6359.32]  subscribers for it let that whole that whole system is hyper inefficient and facilitates doctors
[6359.32 --> 6367.56]  who will work down there making way more money such that a more efficient system can't compete with it
[6367.56 --> 6374.44]  and to be clear i am not saying the canadian system is efficient i am saying it is more efficient
[6374.44 --> 6381.16]  which is objectively true i'm so sorry my american friends um they get like some of them get like super
[6381.16 --> 6385.48]  super super super super mad about anything to do with that sounds any even remotely critical of
[6385.48 --> 6390.76]  anything about america and i apologize sincerely for that that's that's that's my canadian way um
[6392.04 --> 6393.80]  but your system's not very good
[6396.36 --> 6403.88]  yeah apparently there's something called ear planes that can like help with the thing that i have maybe
[6403.88 --> 6408.36]  i'll look into some sort of eustation tube dysfunction the band-aids have freedom i don't remember the names
[6408.36 --> 6414.04]  i have it like i i figured it out with my doctor like i think it was like the second time we went to
[6414.04 --> 6419.00]  ces so this would have been like 2013-20 that's why we have guns so we can end it when we get sick
[6420.20 --> 6425.24]  doesn't the canadian government also recommend that some of the americans in our uh in our chat are uh
[6427.80 --> 6434.52]  spicy yeah all right guys uh yeah yeah langley man says i've been waiting eight months for an mri for a
[6434.52 --> 6440.12]  a rotator cuff injury love canadian health care yeah yeah it's not a perfect system i will not even
[6440.12 --> 6448.12]  from it begin to pretend it's a perfect system um everything's it turns out everything's corrupt
[6448.12 --> 6454.92]  wherever lots of money is involved yeah that's what we learned yeah up here the weights are brutal like i
[6454.92 --> 6460.20]  when i was i was really sick i don't know three months ago something like that um and
[6460.20 --> 6468.04]  it was like go to a walk-in and they're they they basically i i did once and they were more or less
[6468.04 --> 6475.64]  like i don't know okay cool um and then i i went to go schedule an appointment with with my actual
[6475.64 --> 6480.12]  doctor and he's like well it's gonna be like a month or a little bit more before i have an appointment
[6480.12 --> 6488.60]  open because it's not an emergency i was clearly not like dying i was just sick for a really long time
[6489.32 --> 6492.76]  he's like well you can book an appointment and i was like well i'll probably be better by then he's
[6492.76 --> 6500.52]  like yep okay you can always book it and then cancel it when you're close and then an opening will be
[6500.52 --> 6507.48]  available to someone who needs one soon yeah just just saying that's a that's the system we're
[6507.48 --> 6510.84]  apparently supposed to do when after dark we haven't even made it through all our topics
[6510.84 --> 6516.28]  luke has to leave in 18 minutes but we didn't even talk about google's ai citing the onion and
[6516.28 --> 6524.28]  recommending the health benefits of drinking pee google's ai overviews in search appear to be
[6524.28 --> 6530.76]  drawing information from very questionable sources with limited discernment including telling a user
[6530.76 --> 6537.80]  to try making cheese adhere better to their homemade pizza uh to add about an eighth of a cup of elmer's glue
[6537.80 --> 6542.68]  in with the sauce the source for this wisdom appears to be an 11 year old reddit comment made by user
[6543.24 --> 6545.48]  smith
[6545.48 --> 6555.80]  ai overviews likewise recommended eating at least one small rock per day which it attributed to uc berkeley geologists but is
[6555.80 --> 6563.48]  actually a recommendation made in 2020 in a 2021 onion article another user asked what mammal has the
[6563.48 --> 6570.28]  most bones and was instead told that snakes have the most bones of any vertebrate not a mammal i'm afraid
[6570.84 --> 6576.44]  these errors included medical misinformation such as recommending smoking two to three cigarettes a day
[6576.44 --> 6583.40]  while pregnant even prior to the full rollout ai overviews were making similar mistakes including telling
[6583.40 --> 6590.12]  at least one user to drink large amounts of urine in order to dislodge a kidney stone i mean you can't prove it wouldn't work
[6591.64 --> 6595.64]  a google smoke spokesperson says that the mistakes came from
[6596.28 --> 6602.76]  generally very uncommon queries and aren't representative of most people's experiences
[6603.32 --> 6609.96]  i mean that's the thing about hallucinations in it you see most of the world as it is
[6609.96 --> 6615.08]  except for the ants that are crawling out of your skin that cause you to rip your skin off
[6615.72 --> 6622.44]  you know um anywho users can use the web tab to remove these elements or automate the process by
[6622.44 --> 6629.08]  changing their browser settings to add udm equals 14 to the end of their search url in other ai news
[6629.08 --> 6634.04]  which is awesome the chinese website for cooler master is apparently advertising their new cryofuse 5 product
[6634.04 --> 6638.92]  which comes in six different colors as competitive ai thermal paste the official name for the product
[6638.92 --> 6645.48]  translates as thermal paste ai sports lottery um anywho they have apparently apologized for that
[6645.48 --> 6649.88]  and it was a translation error or something but i just thought it was funny to put in with our ai news
[6650.68 --> 6654.68]  i fix it has dumped samsung they're officially dropping them as a partner saying the company seems
[6654.68 --> 6659.16]  unwilling to make good faith progress towards making its devices more repairable however they will
[6659.16 --> 6665.08]  continue to provide parts and repair kits for samsung devices to consumers um since partnering with i fix it
[6665.08 --> 6670.04]  two years ago samsung has apparently kept parts price high and continued to engage in unnecessary
[6670.04 --> 6676.04]  parts pairing according to a leaked contract samsung also required independent repair shops to report the
[6676.04 --> 6681.40]  personal information and repair details of customers and to immediately disassemble samsung devices that
[6681.40 --> 6689.88]  were repaired with third-party parts so with the amount of rules that repair shops have like so eat samsung
[6689.88 --> 6695.08]  basically um i criticize this kind of stuff when apple does it and i would spend a lot longer railing
[6695.08 --> 6704.44]  on this except luke has to go so um dang sorry cold ones reviewed our screwdriver oh really oh uh dan
[6706.36 --> 6711.08]  we tried every youtuber product it's a pretty sick video

[6737.16 --> 6742.92]  pc together with this yeah if you got the wrong screw bit then i'm pretty sure this product like
[6742.92 --> 6747.96]  exists on the market but this that concept exists but this is definitely a very good execution of yeah
[6747.96 --> 6752.12]  it's simple it's sleek i was rough and it fucked the screw not the screwdriver that means the tips are
[6752.12 --> 6759.32]  good the linus tips i'm thinking a tier just from holding it that i have absolutely no issues with it
[6759.32 --> 6765.64]  yeah i'm happy with a all right do you want not bad huh we're a tier boys nice what's s there's shoes and
[6765.64 --> 6772.36]  this is a joke oh they only put like these stupid meme shoes in s everything a is effectively the
[6772.36 --> 6779.00]  top tier beautiful yeah i'm super i'm super excited and honestly dude not a lot of stuff ended up in a
[6779.00 --> 6785.24]  tier like we are among pretty legit company up here so what what is the other stuff in a tier i'm kind
[6785.24 --> 6789.64]  of interested uh hold on well okay man you gotta ask me for all these details that i don't know
[6789.64 --> 6798.60]  okay well let's switch to 4k enhance enhance okay we've got a babish tongs and something some kind
[6798.60 --> 6803.56]  of cooking thing i assume cool we've got whatever this is and whatever this is and whatever this
[6803.56 --> 6810.20]  thing is nice and then and whatever this is joyride oh those are those i would not consider those
[6810.20 --> 6815.16]  particularly a tier they were fine but they were too expensive aren't they uh oh i see aren't they like
[6815.16 --> 6820.36]  more healthy or something we beat the jerry rig everything knife which ended up in b tier we beat
[6820.36 --> 6828.60]  feastables which are fine i guess i guess that's about a b uh we definitely beat are those more
[6828.60 --> 6834.84]  feastables in each year i didn't actually notice that uh mkbhd had a product in here what is it is it
[6834.84 --> 6839.64]  just a mug how do you even rate a mug yeah i don't know they use uh they use like a merch company for
[6839.64 --> 6847.00]  their stuff so it's just like oh basic um i see there's more feastables down there though okay
[6847.00 --> 6851.00]  prime is actually pretty decent tasting i think they're just prime is not good i think they're
[6851.00 --> 6856.04]  just memeing on them there's but no there's issues outside of flavor oh okay oh so okay when i rated
[6856.04 --> 6862.84]  when when i rated um influencer drinks i was only going based on flavor yeah okay prime is not good
[6862.84 --> 6870.60]  crunch labs b they were not into uh mythical cereal same as me i'm sorry mythical but it tastes like
[6870.60 --> 6875.96]  it's it's not good i i've i look this is one of those things that's kind of tough for me because
[6875.96 --> 6879.88]  i think crunch labs is really cool i'm surprised crunch labs wasn't higher i've met some of these
[6879.88 --> 6886.44]  people um and so like for me to be out there just like yeah it's not good um feels a little awkward
[6886.44 --> 6896.28]  but look i got my i got my integrity boys yeah and uh mishmash is not good sorry rough uh they did not
[6896.28 --> 6905.96]  like um pokimane's cookies they are d tier oof and dude perfect whatever this thing is they also do not
[6905.96 --> 6911.72]  like uh hold on i'm trying to switch to my laptop uh whatever this thing is i don't know what this is
[6911.72 --> 6919.88]  oh mr b's chocolate ended up in both e tier i tried saying this i think three times and b tier oh
[6919.88 --> 6924.60]  it's because there's different revisions of it yeah people are saying that the newer recipe is up higher
[6924.60 --> 6930.52]  and the older recipe is down low okay well i'm about to i'm about to have a hot take here um you think
[6931.32 --> 6937.32]  you guys have got no taste oh the original recipe mr beast bars oh i could be wrong i could be wrong
[6937.32 --> 6943.08]  are way higher quality chocolate i could be wrong hold on no i think you're right i don't know the new
[6943.08 --> 6947.88]  recipe looked at one of those the new recipe is like basic mainstream chocolate like if you're like
[6948.68 --> 6957.72]  nestle aero bar that's quality you will like the new recipe but the old recipe is a way more like
[6957.72 --> 6965.48]  traditional proper chocolate can people confirm okay so the order is correct yeah okay yeah yeah so they
[6965.48 --> 6970.12]  they just they went mainstream and basic probably because people were like ew and they were sitting
[6970.12 --> 6975.32]  there going okay well why are we spending so much to put so much real cocoa in this we might as well
[6975.32 --> 6982.20]  give them the the swill that they like sorry swill is a drink thing but uh yeah give give them the trash
[6982.20 --> 6988.28]  that they like yeah um man honestly i don't get it though because you can just get lint chocolate at the
[6988.28 --> 6995.32]  grocery store which is going to absolutely destroy both his original recipe and the new recipe but hey
[6995.32 --> 6999.88]  like you know influencer product right if you like what mr beast does and you want to support him i i
[6999.88 --> 7005.08]  i got i got no problem with that but i do think their branding is like world's best chocolate bar is um
[7007.08 --> 7011.96]  how do you get away with that world's best chocolate world's best pizza what does that even what does that
[7011.96 --> 7018.36]  even what does that even mean define that yourself yeah i mean i guess but i would think you'd have to
[7018.36 --> 7025.72]  i don't know i i'm sure whoever worked on his marketing gave some thought to it or something um
[7027.32 --> 7032.92]  elijah lint is gross yeah but elijah have you eaten any foods like you tried a mango for the first time
[7032.92 --> 7037.88]  like a month ago like what what do you even know about food i'm sorry was that the first time that was
[7037.88 --> 7043.64]  the first time he'd ever eaten a mango it's like come on man i don't know with him sometimes
[7044.60 --> 7049.80]  because his whole like innings thing no he knows he's just trying to mess with us yeah so you think
[7049.80 --> 7053.16]  he's trying to mess with you no no i don't think so you don't think you think that's actually the
[7053.16 --> 7058.92]  first time yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know i don't know i'm 27 years young had never eaten a mango
[7058.92 --> 7064.20]  i'm a little sus a little sus i don't think he would lie about that were you there for you
[7064.20 --> 7069.40]  weren't there for the conversation i thought i was there for him eating it though yeah no no we offered him
[7069.40 --> 7074.44]  some man because like i've never tried that before hockey night yeah yeah that was before i got there
[7076.20 --> 7081.08]  i had mango drinks and dry stuff so he had dried but he'd never never fresh mango okay okay okay
[7081.08 --> 7084.60]  so basically what i'm gonna take food advice from someone who's never tried fresh fruit
[7085.16 --> 7088.12]  like no i'm sorry i'm not i'm not gonna do that it's not gonna be like that

[7239.64 --> 7248.68]  buy a plane no problem and then flow plane support joe has offered to be your your private pilot
[7248.68 --> 7254.76]  so a plane not that expensive
[7257.00 --> 7264.92]  a hanger oh that too yeah yeah very expensive also planes that can go across continents dude quite
[7264.92 --> 7269.96]  expensive dude you are talking small cessnas are one thing the second you can do super long range
[7269.96 --> 7281.24]  you are talking to someone who has flown one time one time in his entire life in business class
[7281.96 --> 7290.60]  oh yeah me too one time it was by i don't remember some sponsor ended up doing the flights for us and we
[7290.60 --> 7295.08]  realized like as we got on where on the plane we were going it was brandon and i we're both just like
[7295.08 --> 7299.56]  what and we came out of the experience you know some people are like i did it once i could never go
[7299.56 --> 7305.88]  back we came out of the experience be like i'm never paying for that because we looked at the price
[7305.88 --> 7312.04]  difference versus what we got really proud no i mean we both got here right yeah exactly like i don't
[7312.04 --> 7321.72]  know yeah man there is i i cannot ah man i'm trying to think okay because like but like taylor swift was
[7321.72 --> 7327.56]  like flying from her like overseas ass concert to like watch travis kelsey play in like super bowl
[7327.56 --> 7333.16]  or whatever and like you know what i get it if you've got that kind of resource that man i got
[7333.16 --> 7337.72]  such a kick that's an irrelevant amount of money i got such a kick out of people being like taylor
[7337.72 --> 7344.68]  swift is now a billionaire earlier this year i'm like are you kidding me okay if my stupid company
[7345.32 --> 7351.48]  no offense to my company got an offer my highly intelligent company yeah if if this
[7351.72 --> 7359.56]  if this got valued at a tenth of a billion dollars at one point are you kidding me that she just
[7359.56 --> 7368.36]  crossed the line you don't think taylor swift is worth a hundred of me now ten times please
[7369.40 --> 7376.28]  are you kidding me anyway um okay so on the one hand like i get it when you have that level of
[7376.28 --> 7380.36]  resources if you can just buy a plane joe will fly it if you can just if you can just hop to your
[7380.36 --> 7386.84]  boyfriend's football game like i can see why she would do it but i legitimately i legitimately have
[7386.84 --> 7392.68]  a very difficult time imagining a world where i would do anything other than commercial air travel
[7393.56 --> 7397.88]  like i just i don't i i don't i i don't think i can i don't think i can accept it
[7399.16 --> 7404.28]  helicopter just i mean joe can't fly that helicopter great for kobe
[7404.28 --> 7412.12]  you have to i'm serious those things actually reasonable those things are death traps i the
[7412.12 --> 7416.60]  amount of times i hear do you know why they call it the jesus nut because it's not because he did it
[7416.60 --> 7417.16]  on your face
[7419.88 --> 7428.44]  no it's because there is one nut one nut because it's perfect and he doesn't need two sorry sorry there is
[7428.44 --> 7436.52]  one he lost the other one in an industrial accident we don't bring that up there is there is one nut
[7436.52 --> 7443.32]  that gets torqued onto the top of the rotor assembly that holds the rotor blades in place
[7444.12 --> 7452.04]  if it comes loose for whatever reason on this vibrating ass spinning ass contraption if it comes loose
[7452.04 --> 7461.40]  the rotors go and the helicopter fly falls out of the sky so you call it the jesus nut because you
[7461.40 --> 7467.16]  pray to jesus it never comes off okay those things are flipping scary okay have you flown in a helicopter
[7467.16 --> 7472.52]  you've been in a helicopter average helicopter crash at around nine per 100 000 flight hours that seems
[7472.52 --> 7480.04]  crazy high okay luke have you been in a helicopter before yes a few times okay they're made of cardboard
[7480.04 --> 7485.24]  yeah that's kind of true i was i was looking at the thing i was going like that's it
[7489.72 --> 7495.96]  okay so that answers the question then not the helicopter route time to buy a plane and joe can
[7495.96 --> 7502.52]  fly it for you easy you know what okay taron you know constantly coming up and down yeah that there's
[7502.52 --> 7507.64]  got to be a cost to that there's got to be a lot less than a plane you could just get a plane and then
[7507.64 --> 7513.96]  when when he's not what about what about a plane timeshare this is what i'm saying you could rent
[7513.96 --> 7520.52]  taylor swifts plane when she's not going to her boyfriend's taylor swift doesn't know who i am
[7520.52 --> 7522.92]  yeah i think be the change you want to see in the world
[7525.08 --> 7527.08]  maybe if you went to a foosball game once in a while
[7527.08 --> 7532.44]  when you say football like that it's a black and white ball
[7535.64 --> 7541.00]  when he's not flying taron you know he can fly other people boom now you have a new company
[7543.00 --> 7553.72]  boom new company oh lordy um solved i'll say this when personal like one passenger plus like your
[7553.72 --> 7560.52]  backpack vtol never gonna happen will not happen in our lifetimes have you met people who drive cars
[7563.00 --> 7568.60]  what what sorry i can't tell whose side you're on you think it's gonna be ai or not you i i think the
[7568.60 --> 7573.16]  only possible way is if it's like predefined routes or ai driven or something that i don't
[7573.16 --> 7578.68]  think it's like traffic accidents gone up since tesla introduced self-driving cars i don't know man
[7578.68 --> 7584.60]  no idea there's a lot of companies trying to build these things they're gonna fail stop it and that's
[7584.60 --> 7594.04]  okay that is something that i would legitimately move for i would relocate to an area that allows
[7594.04 --> 7602.44]  me to have my own personal like like little quadcopter that i can fly to work in see if you just if you
[7602.44 --> 7607.80]  just want a personal plane you can already do that yeah but that where am i gonna fly i don't
[7607.80 --> 7612.28]  want to go anywhere on staff who can fly it i just go to work him back you just you just buy a plane
[7612.28 --> 7617.00]  it's simple dude i got i look i got a motorcycle it's simple and people are like oh yeah you know
[7617.00 --> 7622.60]  like i i did like a six hour ride up to squamish and back and i did this and i did that i'm like yeah
[7622.60 --> 7629.16]  i drove to work i excuse me i rode to work and then i rode home i don't go anywhere i don't i don't
[7629.16 --> 7635.08]  i don't want to go anywhere i just i just want i just want to go to work in my little private plane
[7635.72 --> 7641.72]  that's all so anything that i can't land in my backyard i'm not even interested in i don't even
[7641.72 --> 7646.12]  want it there you go joe there's the specs for the plane it has to be able to land in linus's
[7646.12 --> 7654.60]  backyard there's a pool there careful careful oh man get a heli land in your yard and land at the
[7654.60 --> 7660.44]  office do you have any idea the kind of letter i would get from our strata council if i tried to
[7660.44 --> 7668.68]  land a helicopter at our office you don't think they like it is is that guy still around oh yeah
[7668.68 --> 7672.04]  yeah yeah yeah neighbor steve he might be down he's our neighbor just telling me you're friends with
[7672.04 --> 7678.20]  taylor swift there we go yeah but it's never going to happen laws are not going to allow this i will move
[7678.20 --> 7686.04]  well i will move to the uae no you won't i won't move to the uae oh you won't that is false
[7688.28 --> 7691.80]  where where would potentially allow this nevada that you
[7694.68 --> 7697.40]  yeah they're in a desert there's not a lot of like you know
[7699.00 --> 7704.84]  people where are you even flying to at that point texas texas i will join mr musk in texas if i can
[7704.84 --> 7711.72]  have a jetson you wouldn't move to texas i i would consider it i would strongly consider it is that
[7711.72 --> 7717.40]  where we're gonna have the cult can we have these in the cult um you know what you can wash mine
[7717.40 --> 7723.08]  move in the texas i'm down cultists are allowed to wash my personal aircraft do thank you sir thank
[7723.08 --> 7728.12]  you for the property will be insanely more affordable i need to pause for a second cult cult guys
[7728.12 --> 7733.48]  that's a joke this is a joke we have where like we should form a cult and i should be the leader i am
[7733.48 --> 7740.68]  playing a character touch grass okay cool the non-joke is that i'm gonna buy a plane for joe to fly
[7741.96 --> 7747.96]  no that's not happening we do live near the islands he could buy a float plane
[7750.84 --> 7757.00]  they are joe can train to fly a float plane extremely no problem and land it where fraser river yeah your
[7757.00 --> 7762.20]  your lake cabin you go to bowen island what i'm gonna live on the fraser river port browning is really nice
[7762.20 --> 7767.80]  it smells disgusting it's a little icky it's a little it's maybe a little ganges go to gang you
[7767.80 --> 7775.24]  know what i am sure that joe could drive the car from the float plane dock to to your chauffeur yeah
[7775.80 --> 7780.84]  chauffeur plane and car chauffeur there you go i don't think he'd mind as long as he gets to fly the
[7780.84 --> 7785.88]  plane uh we did a fraction of our topics today we are less than half of the way through our topics
[7785.88 --> 7789.80]  and i need to kind of you have to leave three minutes ago okay if you have to go then you've
[7789.80 --> 7795.80]  got to go but it means that we are uh we are in for i can hear i can check maybe we're in for an
[7795.80 --> 7802.92]  adventure uh the u.s government has put a 25 tax back on chinese assembled motherboards pc cases and
[7802.92 --> 7808.52]  graphics cards the tariff was paused for a year to collect industry feedback it's unknown when it will
[7808.52 --> 7813.16]  resume but the biden administration has indicated that it will be steeply increasing tariffs on other
[7813.16 --> 7818.36]  chinese goods like semiconductors lithium-ion ev batteries and electric vehicles the tariff on
[7818.36 --> 7825.08]  semiconductors is the steepest and will be increasing from 25 to 50 percent uh this is going to be a
[7825.08 --> 7829.56]  problem but it may not be as much of a problem as you would think because a lot of these companies
[7829.56 --> 7835.72]  moved their assembly or at least diversified their assembly outside of china in order to get around this
[7835.72 --> 7842.76]  back when the trump administration put it in place um scarlett johannison is having a bit of uh johannson
[7842.76 --> 7850.84]  sorry excuse me um is having a bit of a tiff with open ai over a voice that um people including her
[7850.84 --> 7860.52]  say sounds eerily similar to her which is her that is to say uh the movie her which uh is like the ai in
[7860.52 --> 7865.72]  the movie her which is voiced by her which is uh scarlett johannson who is having this dispute okay
[7865.72 --> 7870.68]  she did the voice for her um so we're we've got a couple quick voice comparisons here can we can we
[7870.68 --> 7879.96]  listen can we listen we ready oh also while we figure that out uh i i won't say the thing we're
[7879.96 --> 7885.88]  doing but i have a response from wendell cool is he down he's down and he has some suggestions nice
[7885.88 --> 7891.40]  i knew he would yeah okay when did you give it to yourself well right when you asked me if i had a
[7891.40 --> 7896.36]  name i thought yeah he's right i do need a name but i wanted to pick a good one so i read a book called
[7896.36 --> 7901.96]  how to name your baby and out of 180 000 names that's the one i like a bedtime story about robots
[7901.96 --> 7910.68]  and love i got you covered gather round barrett once upon a time in a world i actually don't think
[7910.68 --> 7921.48]  those sound that similar um maybe the inflections the first one was actually her right yeah yeah okay
[7921.48 --> 7925.08]  because i was listening to the first one and i was partially focused on my phone when you're teeing
[7925.08 --> 7932.92]  up the topic god what a sexy voice that sounds what she has a super sexy voice what who scarlett
[7932.92 --> 7938.76]  johannson you don't think so what a comment uh what why do you think she was cast for the part
[7938.76 --> 7944.60]  it's just a weird it's not like it's a controversial take all right you're basic um
[7946.28 --> 7946.76]  got him
[7949.40 --> 7956.44]  you like the voice that whoever directed this movie thought you would like sorry sorry you know what i
[7956.44 --> 7961.08]  like the backstreet boys too what are you gonna do about it that is pretty basic come at me that is
[7961.64 --> 7966.84]  they're cool they're the backstreet dads now and they're just as cool as they were if not more so yeah
[7966.84 --> 7971.40]  listening to that first one i was like wow that does really sound like that i didn't realize it's
[7971.40 --> 7979.88]  from the movie the second one it it sounds like uh you know inspired by uh i don't even think it does
[7979.88 --> 7983.16]  i don't think it sounds anything like her i don't think it sounds
[7986.76 --> 7990.84]  if you yeah like i didn't hear it and immediately think her
[7990.84 --> 7997.24]  but maybe it sounds like a bad impressionist trying to be her if that makes sense
[7999.08 --> 8003.80]  like not an actual impressionist just like your friend yeah i don't know i uh
[8004.68 --> 8010.04]  i'm afraid anyway there's a whole thing where like they apparently reached out to her to be the voice
[8010.04 --> 8015.72]  and she refused and then there's some other stuff going on over at open ai and people are concerned
[8015.72 --> 8020.12]  about the company's direction i don't know i i'm i'm so sorry i feel like this is almost like uh
[8020.68 --> 8026.12]  uh what what was it like lindsey lohan or something that was upset about one of the gta cover art things
[8026.76 --> 8030.92]  was that lindsey lohan i think so i don't remember who it was but i remember that was a thing
[8032.44 --> 8044.60]  gta yeah yeah this like really i i i'm sorry but that is that is the most npc npc you know blonde bikini
[8044.60 --> 8051.24]  person ever like your hair's curly here hers isn't like i don't know man i just know like people
[8051.24 --> 8057.24]  posing with the peace sign at that time was super come check your messages oh no not yours oh well for
[8059.24 --> 8066.12]  you'd never message anyway what i'm kidding uh there's a bilingual brain implant i don't know
[8066.12 --> 8070.36]  maybe next week um yeah okay the last thing that you really need to weigh in is that uh battle state
[8070.36 --> 8075.96]  games has tripped over their own again again yeah so you don't know about this okay following
[8075.96 --> 8082.52]  battle state games decision to undermine its 150 edge of darkness edition of tarkov with a 250
[8083.16 --> 8088.20]  unheard edition with an exclusive pve mode and various other pay to win goodies yeah some players
[8088.20 --> 8094.28]  caved and shelled out the additional hundred dollars to upgrade a few days later battle state reduced the
[8094.28 --> 8100.20]  cost of upgrading by half but instead of refunding those players the 50 difference they gave them a
[8100.20 --> 8106.76]  single use 50 in-game voucher if the player buys something that costs less than 50 they lose the
[8106.76 --> 8113.72]  remaining value yeah could these guys be more cartoonishly anti-consumer if they tried i think
[8113.72 --> 8117.96]  this is maybe just something that we didn't cover at the time but this is this is fairly old at this
[8117.96 --> 8123.56]  point um i think they've gone somewhat quiet for a while just realizing every single thing that they
[8123.56 --> 8129.24]  were doing was bad and dumb um so they stopped doing things because that was actually better for them i mean
[8129.24 --> 8137.56]  that's not a terrible approach yeah um it was sure weird especially the lose the remaining value
[8137.56 --> 8144.04]  thing but i think i get it i'm assuming that they just don't have like a credit system yeah probably
[8144.92 --> 8150.36]  hanlon's razor it's probably not malicious it probably i think some things that they do complete
[8150.36 --> 8154.92]  and utter incompetence yeah but hanlon's razor doesn't say there's never malice right it says don't
[8154.92 --> 8159.96]  attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence and i think you're
[8159.96 --> 8164.20]  right i think this falls under probably incompetence i think so just because like they they try to do
[8164.20 --> 8169.88]  all the things themselves right oh so popular hello
[8169.88 --> 8181.16]  okay please do that okay this one's a lot closer maybe it's kate upton i don't know
[8182.84 --> 8186.76]  i don't remember who it was i mean was it no no it was lindsay lohan oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
[8187.32 --> 8192.60]  but red reddit was looking for something that was more similar apparently yeah sorry apparently i a
[8192.60 --> 8199.24]  bunch of people thought that was their phones my bad i lied i have one more topic okay icq is no more uh-oh
[8200.20 --> 8205.24]  yeah i didn't know it was still a thing me neither okay but it's set to shut down on june 26 which is
[8205.24 --> 8213.16]  in two days after nearly 30 years of operation should we buy it oh mate better than teams
[8215.24 --> 8217.08]  can we use icq internally
[8219.16 --> 8226.92]  please can we can we sso icq oh my gosh oh icq slack integration
[8229.88 --> 8234.68]  guys that's not actually an option i'm i'm meaning you suck you it's june 26 not
[8235.32 --> 8242.20]  oh sorry it's may i got my hopes up haha um yeah i don't know should we buy it wouldn't that be
[8242.20 --> 8247.56]  hilarious is it is it potentially for sale i don't know users are encouraged to migrate messaging
[8247.56 --> 8255.40]  platforms from parent company vk vk who is this i don't know probably it's venture capital with a k
[8255.40 --> 8261.56]  like it's probably some holding company who knows have i ever ever have ever told you about
[8261.56 --> 8267.00]  the name of ea game one of ea games is mobile companies no capital games
[8267.00 --> 8279.48]  i hope they sit on tax oh that's pretty good it's pretty good it's pretty good yeah it's pretty good
[8279.48 --> 8289.32]  wow wow ah ha worse uh okay we've got something really important for you guys yeah here sorry one
[8289.32 --> 8301.96]  sec i'm just gonna yes yes yes capital games yes yes oh it's funny sorry uh yeah oh so i've got my
[8301.96 --> 8311.56]  notes from tanner here um we need your help okay so this is up to date as of three days ago uh we are
[8311.56 --> 8319.32]  trying to digitize the full quality masters of reboot the first computer animated tv series uh the reboot
[8319.32 --> 8327.32]  master tapes are in a d1 format there were only six models of vtrs that used that format and only two
[8327.32 --> 8333.32]  or three of them will likely be able to read these particular master tapes uh the vtrs that will work
[8333.32 --> 8340.68]  are the dcr 300 and the dcr 500 from broadcast television systems which was a bosch and phillips
[8340.68 --> 8350.20]  partnership we purchased three vtrs oh good lord uh we apparently purchased a dcr 300 and two dcr 500s
[8350.20 --> 8355.56]  and we've had some small playback test successes confirming that the tapes are in surprisingly good
[8355.56 --> 8361.64]  shape and it says yeah sea bottom of dog it looks great okay so here we've been working on this in
[8361.64 --> 8367.64]  the background for a while because we just think this is pretty sick and good vibes and oh my god
[8367.64 --> 8377.80]  yeah that looks so good yeah okay man now i want to watch some reboot okay anywho yeah oh man that's
[8377.80 --> 8386.52]  super exciting um very clean all right the problem one of the dcr 500s was working for a short time
[8386.52 --> 8392.04]  however it is now experiencing errors and while all three machines have some sort of issue there should
[8392.04 --> 8398.52]  be enough to cobble together something that works the main error we're getting across the machines is
[8398.52 --> 8406.04]  servo reference v pulse frequency too high the machines will not load or play back without clearing these
[8406.04 --> 8410.68]  checks we've tried tracking down the company that made them so far none of our contacts have been
[8410.68 --> 8417.56]  able to find anything um these particular machines were manufactured by bts from 1992 to 1995 which
[8417.56 --> 8423.72]  meant a different thing back then uh phillips took over bts in 1995 which then turned into okay this is
[8423.72 --> 8429.24]  a lot of thank you tanner uh these are a lot of tanner details uh let me distill it down um thompson
[8429.24 --> 8435.40]  broke up a blog a grass valley inc may have taken over the d1 hardware back catalog but our contacts there
[8435.40 --> 8439.72]  were not able to find anything the parts that didn't go to grass valley inc were sold to partner
[8439.72 --> 8445.24]  capital group in 2008 something something something prasad studios didn't have any information for us
[8445.24 --> 8450.76]  they are based in india where it appears the d1 format was never in use uh replacing capacitors
[8451.40 --> 8457.16]  is something that we have tried and we apparently had replacement rollers fabricated and replaced
[8457.16 --> 8463.24]  where they were degraded what we are looking for ah yes this is this is what i was looking for manuals
[8463.24 --> 8472.12]  for the dcr 300 and dcr 500 we're missing operator's manual circuit diagrams part one and bts's internal
[8472.12 --> 8477.56]  service manuals we also are looking for some specialized tools we would like to get extender
[8477.56 --> 8486.68]  board 1409 for tape deck adjustment tape dr5 and any additional calibration tapes we also would love to
[8486.68 --> 8492.12]  get in touch with some experts if you have hands-on experience with bts d1 machines particular the dc
[8492.12 --> 8499.08]  particularly the dcr 300 or dcr 500 doesn't matter what region you have experience in um they had
[8499.08 --> 8505.48]  offices in netherlands salt lake city utah singapore brazil france burbank california and mulgrave
[8505.48 --> 8510.04]  australia odds are good if anyone knows about these machines they would have worked at or near one of
[8510.04 --> 8515.40]  these locations what we are not looking for armchair technicians that think they might know what the
[8515.40 --> 8522.04]  issue is we have plenty of those internally sorry my finger slipped um rude we are not looking for
[8522.04 --> 8529.48]  technicians with similar for a familiarity with similar players um these were produced in a time
[8529.48 --> 8535.56]  when tech standards were fast loose and constantly changing we are not looking for anyone to cold call
[8535.56 --> 8540.76]  any of the companies involved do not cold call on our behalf we've already done it don't harass people
[8540.76 --> 8547.08]  it's it's stupid um we're not looking for anything that is built for a tape deck that is not the d1 format
[8547.08 --> 8552.44]  and we are not looking for external options to capture the tapes we want to learn and share the knowledge
[8552.44 --> 8560.52]  not just hire a capture service the contact information is right here this is very important reboot
[8560.52 --> 8570.20]  rewind reboot rewind doc at gmail.com if you can legitimately help us with any of those things we said we do need
[8570.20 --> 8579.80]  and not the things that we said we don't need um very hopeful that we can restore reboot to its former glory that would be super cool
[8579.80 --> 8584.92]  i had heard we were interested in doing that i didn't know tanner was doing any work on that
[8584.92 --> 8591.72]  yeah dog this is very cool to hear epic yep going yeah i i i was like blank check let's go
[8591.72 --> 8597.64]  and then apparently we bought three machines it's an extremely blank yeah um check with a really long underscore
[8597.64 --> 8604.84]  look i think it's i think it's it's cool it's very cool it starts a lot of conversations about
[8606.04 --> 8614.60]  how we think of the internet and we think of things that are digital as as as as being preserved forever
[8614.60 --> 8621.00]  as being around forever but actually as the as the the the waves and waves of of data creation have
[8621.00 --> 8627.16]  gotten larger and larger we are actually at risk of losing more and more and more unless we make
[8627.64 --> 8636.12]  a concerted effort to preserve what we had what was important and this is again you know back to you
[8636.12 --> 8642.76]  know the skin that i have in the game it's a canadian show uh produced here in canada and it is i i believe
[8642.76 --> 8651.72]  of historical significance being the first animated computer animated tv show so yeah toy story pretty
[8651.72 --> 8661.80]  special moment um reboot also a pretty special moment in uh in computer graphics but i also have
[8661.80 --> 8666.92]  to leave see you later goodbye sort of not end of show langleyman asks how's this better quality than
[8666.92 --> 8675.16]  blu-ray you can't make a blu-ray without the master tapes these are the master tapes these are where the
[8675.16 --> 8683.16]  episodes are stored they're not available in their original quality anywhere else so this is so that
[8683.80 --> 8686.92]  there could be a blu-ray potentially yeah
[8690.20 --> 8696.92]  so cool um all right so i guess it's uh just you and me oh
[8696.92 --> 8709.08]  uh hi let's go with not this view maybe i mean yeah that's not great either um how about that how
[8709.08 --> 8712.92]  about just move yourself over there is that a thing that you
[8716.12 --> 8720.68]  you didn't even manage to go in the right direction really backwards backwards i didn't even realize that
[8720.68 --> 8724.84]  uh yeah sure uh we i don't know if we want to put dan in the chair because he's logged into all this
[8724.84 --> 8727.96]  stuff over there and it'll be a bit of a hassle for him to do that over here and we've still got
[8727.96 --> 8732.84]  to do merge messages i think it's time for when show after dark so uh shall we shall we do that sure
[8732.84 --> 8740.28]  i really sincerely wish that i had used the uh fact that luke was still here to run to the washroom
[8740.28 --> 8745.48]  earlier because now i just get to hold it for the rest of the show cool all right hit me dan
[8745.48 --> 8755.80]  sure sure we'll try and make this uh working uh hey so now echo and nad i recently got an rfid collar
[8755.80 --> 8760.76]  cat feeders to prevent them stealing food from each other and they have been awesome is there any pet
[8760.76 --> 8767.80]  related tech that you ended up loving i had one of those rfid um kitty doors and the idea was that one
[8767.80 --> 8772.36]  of the cats would be allowed out into the garage and one of them wouldn't uh they ended up being so
[8772.36 --> 8778.12]  strong our cats um the bangles that they were both able to just force the door open in either
[8778.12 --> 8786.68]  direction but the concept was pretty cool because the idea was you could authorize in out in and out
[8786.68 --> 8795.88]  or nothing on a per microchip uh basis uh i i have not actually ended up investing in much pet technology
[8795.88 --> 8801.72]  my cats just seem to be too smart to care about anything that's not actually human controlled like you
[8801.72 --> 8806.92]  can't just have a little you know thing on a motor that just kind of moves around they just they get
[8806.92 --> 8813.88]  bored of it hey dll when did ltd writers start getting more screen time and what goes into deciding
[8813.88 --> 8820.60]  when a writer is or isn't featured on a particular video this has been a different answer at various
[8820.60 --> 8826.28]  stages in the company's history i mean the first time a writer was featured on screen was when luke joined
[8826.28 --> 8832.76]  me for wan show like 10 years ago or something like that um as for what goes into deciding when
[8832.76 --> 8837.16]  a writer is or isn't featured in a particular video there's a number of criteria that we look at
[8837.16 --> 8845.40]  internally james is actually the one who created kind of a a a rubric for uh determining you know
[8845.40 --> 8850.68]  whether someone should be on camera and what are the success metrics that we're going to be looking
[8850.68 --> 8855.96]  for it's something that's not actually rolled out yet because up until now it's been a little bit more
[8855.96 --> 8861.88]  gut feel but there are definitely things that we that we look for i mean we look at subject matter
[8861.88 --> 8866.76]  passion uh that's something that's really important to us because you can you can train people to be
[8866.76 --> 8872.52]  somewhat functional on camera but you can't train someone to actually care about the thing that they're
[8872.52 --> 8879.24]  talking about and genuine caring about it is in a lot of ways a lot easier than learning to act like
[8879.24 --> 8884.04]  you care about it right so if we just take people who are genuinely really interested and passionate
[8884.04 --> 8891.16]  and excited you know even if they are you know let's say um a relatively low energy personality right
[8891.16 --> 8896.68]  like you look at your high energy personalities the people like uh like me or an alex and you compare
[8896.68 --> 8901.88]  that to someone that is maybe more of a low energy personality like like a nicholas plouffe
[8901.88 --> 8910.12]  he can still be really excited and you can still get engaged with that um because he just genuinely
[8910.12 --> 8917.80]  cares right so it makes up for a lot of differences in style that might otherwise not really work um
[8917.80 --> 8923.88]  one of the things is you know how well do we want the video to perform it's no secret that a video will
[8923.88 --> 8928.60]  perform better if it's hosted by me and the more hosted by me it is the more better i mean it's something
[8928.60 --> 8933.80]  that mr beast has talked about on his videos where his you know supporting cast appears for an
[8933.80 --> 8939.72]  extended period of time retention goes down it's it's uh people subscribe to these channels and the
[8939.72 --> 8946.44]  the closest parasocial relationship they have is with the primary host of these channels and you can
[8946.44 --> 8953.64]  kind of you can have other personalities be part of it but they are less permanent than the primary hosts
[8953.64 --> 8961.24]  of these channels i mean like i don't i don't know for certain that luke will be on ltt forever i think
[8961.24 --> 8967.48]  so i mean we're buddies we're good um i he he believes in the company he believes in our mission all these
[8967.48 --> 8973.16]  things are aligned but at the end of the day you know an employee doesn't have the same level of
[8973.16 --> 8980.92]  permanence as the owner founder host um so you know that's something that has to be carefully
[8980.92 --> 8987.24]  considered when you're going to start grooming someone for on-camera appearances and and investing
[8987.80 --> 8993.48]  in both that that training of them for for the new job that they're doing and training the audience to
[8993.48 --> 8999.08]  get to get used to seeing them right so there's man there's a lot of things to consider but i'd say
[8999.08 --> 9004.12]  the biggest ones are are just you know how much is the audience going to like this because at the end
[9004.12 --> 9010.12]  of the day you guys are the boss and if you guys like it then it's good and it works and if you guys don't
[9010.12 --> 9018.28]  like it then it doesn't work and the whole thing collapses right oh let's see hey dale would you
[9018.28 --> 9023.16]  like to in uh who would you like to invite next to the wan show i find myself still thinking about
[9023.16 --> 9027.96]  the conversations with jim keller and telling anyone that will listen i find myself still thinking about
[9027.96 --> 9032.92]  the conversation with jim keller that was great um i have not had any particular thoughts on someone
[9032.92 --> 9039.56]  else we'd like to invite to the wan show that one just kind of fell into my lap i still have a lot of
[9039.56 --> 9045.56]  the same concerns that i had around having him as a guest right like we almost never start on time
[9045.56 --> 9052.04]  because our schedules are are hectic and and difficult so anytime we have a guest who you know
[9052.04 --> 9058.44]  earns more in a day than i'm worth in six months right like i and i don't necessarily think that mr keller
[9058.44 --> 9062.36]  is paying himself that much i just mean if we were to bring on okay let's say let's say jensen right
[9062.36 --> 9068.20]  if we were to invite jensen to the wan show it's like i don't know how how many how many cents did
[9068.20 --> 9073.48]  the nvidia stock go up in the last half an hour while he's been waiting for us right like i
[9074.60 --> 9078.68]  it's something that i feel self-conscious about that's for sure i don't want to disrespect anybody
[9078.68 --> 9082.68]  and if i know that i'm probably not going to be on time then i'd rather just not book the meeting
[9082.68 --> 9087.64]  so there's a little bit of that and a little bit of just like it's tough to find the right balance
[9087.64 --> 9093.96]  right like i've definitely seen other tech creators that have platformed people that i honestly
[9093.96 --> 9101.96]  wouldn't have been that comfortable with a lot of um a lot of people are hyper influential but honestly
[9101.96 --> 9109.88]  have um have things to answer for that i would feel obligated to ask them like i i there are a
[9109.88 --> 9114.84]  number of people in the billionaire class that if i had them on the show like think about it for
[9114.84 --> 9119.96]  yourself with jim keller it's no problem let's talk about you know microprocessor design future
[9119.96 --> 9127.56]  of computing amazing conversation what a great guy um but you know he doesn't have a lot of baggage
[9128.28 --> 9133.56]  as far as i'm aware like if if i had one of like one of the the you know the real titans like one of
[9133.56 --> 9137.64]  the one of the one of the billionaires right if i had one of those on the show like if i brought if i
[9137.64 --> 9143.24]  brought in jensen if i didn't ask him why he doesn't give two about gamers anymore would you guys be
[9143.24 --> 9147.40]  happy with that right so what am i going to do i'm going to bring these guys on i'm going to do a puff
[9147.40 --> 9151.96]  piece i'm just going to like ask them questions they want to answer and and that's it like look
[9151.96 --> 9159.16]  at man look at how much um elon musk's demeanor changed as soon as don lemon started asking him
[9159.16 --> 9164.36]  the questions that he should be answering he basically goes i don't have to i don't have to answer
[9164.36 --> 9169.48]  your questions yeah because that's his attitude he doesn't think he owes anybody a explanation for
[9169.48 --> 9175.08]  anything it's that it's it's that arrogance that i would feel obligated to challenge if i have
[9175.08 --> 9180.60]  someone here on my platform in front of your eyeballs that's that's my responsibility and i'd
[9180.60 --> 9187.40]  honestly rather just not have him on hey linus when renovating your home was it worth it to you to
[9187.40 --> 9192.76]  install outlets with usb both type a and c in convenient places or did you decide using charging
[9192.76 --> 9199.48]  block was better i wish that i had done some of them with uh usb ports i uh we didn't we just left
[9199.48 --> 9204.68]  all the original outlets because we didn't want to throw money in a dumpster for no reason uh but i i
[9204.68 --> 9209.08]  definitely wish that i'd strategically put some in in fact i bought a couple and they're still sitting
[9209.08 --> 9214.76]  in my bin of stuff to do to strategically install like under the kitchen counter and like in a couple of
[9214.76 --> 9220.12]  other places i i considered at one point replacing all of them and if we were going to replace them
[9220.12 --> 9224.12]  i was going to be like ah screw it i don't know get the usb ones uh but then i looked at the price
[9224.12 --> 9227.40]  difference i was like oh okay actually you know what just forget the whole thing put the original
[9227.40 --> 9232.28]  ones back in uh but yeah i'm gonna go around i'll do it myself in an afternoon or something like that
[9232.28 --> 9237.48]  it's if you i i i'm not recommending that you do that in fact in some places it's illegal to work on
[9237.48 --> 9244.76]  your own house in that manner but i um i have the capability of replacing a duplex receptacle so you
[9244.76 --> 9249.56]  know just to turn off the breaker make sure all the things go in the right place um so i do intend to do
[9249.56 --> 9256.52]  that at some point hi wanda dl buying this as a father's day gift my question is for luke uh well
[9257.64 --> 9262.76]  awkward i've worked at a startup that does web scraping what are your thoughts on the laws that
[9262.76 --> 9268.92]  protect from it right now it's a gray zone linus do you have any thoughts for luke uh sure yeah um
[9269.96 --> 9278.12]  luke generally believes in a in an open internet and um understands the the complexities and challenges
[9278.12 --> 9286.12]  around allowing anyone unlimited access to your api um so that's why you obviously can't just pull as
[9286.12 --> 9292.44]  many requests that way as you want so that's one of the reasons that screen scraping is done he also
[9292.44 --> 9299.24]  understands the value of protecting your data protecting your content um and understands why you
[9299.24 --> 9305.88]  know a website might try to protect against screen scraping but you know i think he's going to balance
[9305.88 --> 9313.96]  the that knowledge against his general belief in um that information should be openly available
[9313.96 --> 9321.08]  uh to people and so i think he would probably have a a nuanced take rather than uh a yay or nay this
[9321.08 --> 9324.76]  should be a thing or this shouldn't be a thing there i did my best i'm pretty sure that's something
[9324.76 --> 9330.92]  like what luke would say i got another question for luke dang it i uh whoops uh have you followed
[9330.92 --> 9335.32]  anything for the game dark and darker have you have you you don't play extraction shooters nope i
[9335.32 --> 9343.96]  haven't look luke okay look he's not gonna answer look hey question mostly for linus hey we got one
[9343.96 --> 9348.44]  nice are there any other vr games aside from beat saber that you use to work out i personally love
[9348.44 --> 9355.32]  until you fall i man beat saber just kind of became my thing um i definitely liked hollow point before that
[9355.32 --> 9361.64]  um it's a wow is that ever a dynamic game once you get past the first couple of levels you're diving
[9361.64 --> 9366.44]  you're ducking you're dodging um really cool if you haven't played it before basically you've got a
[9366.44 --> 9372.20]  bow and arrow and you've got to you've got to shoot these things that they turn red gradually and then
[9372.20 --> 9376.84]  when they do they fire something at you and when you break them they fire something at you so you
[9376.84 --> 9381.24]  basically have to hit them and immediately dodge every single time you take one down you gotta
[9381.24 --> 9386.76]  and you gotta be looking all around you all the time because they they spawn in and then they start
[9386.76 --> 9391.24]  changing color and then you get up a little bit higher and then like guys start coming at you on
[9391.24 --> 9398.04]  the ground it's it's it's it's crazy when the pandemic yes i was trying to do the aunt beru voice
[9398.04 --> 9404.28]  thank you for catching it quantum rand when the pandemic hit we went from one to one chromebooks
[9404.28 --> 9409.80]  we went to one to one chromebooks as an it teacher trying to certify students in the a plus
[9409.80 --> 9414.44]  i have students that have never used windows it's becoming an issue how can i prep them
[9415.40 --> 9421.32]  you can't um uh yeah no but this is what i'm talking about this is what i'm talking about you've
[9421.32 --> 9425.56]  got an entire generation of kids who the only computer that they might interface with on a
[9425.56 --> 9431.96]  regular basis is a chromebook um i think a plus is going to have to kind of like figure that figure
[9431.96 --> 9435.56]  that out a little bit and that's going to have to be part of their prep materials that they develop
[9435.56 --> 9442.28]  and let's see last one i've got for you here hey lld i've seen some big youtube channels starting
[9442.28 --> 9446.60]  their own streaming services recently did they contact you about floatplane has the moment for
[9446.60 --> 9455.16]  floatplane as a service arrived um no i think we need we would need to hire someone whose entire job is to
[9455.80 --> 9463.16]  is to build out floatplanes offering and it's very clear to me that there are streaming services that
[9463.16 --> 9471.56]  could benefit from our team's expertise i i i tuned into the canucks short-lived playoff run and i
[9471.56 --> 9479.96]  discovered that um sportsnet plus which is owned by rogers which is a media giant here in canada um isp
[9480.52 --> 9488.04]  mobile network provider uh anyway they they own the broadcasting rights for um that particular series i
[9488.04 --> 9493.00]  think the nhl in canada i don't know whatever i i i forget how the rights work it's been a long time
[9493.00 --> 9499.16]  since i've followed it closely the point is i was watching on roger sports net plus and um hilariously
[9499.16 --> 9506.68]  i discovered that they have not figured out a drm protection scheme that protects their streams from
[9507.32 --> 9516.60]  users simply logging in opening a stream window getting a session key and then just sharing that with
[9516.60 --> 9521.48]  anyone they they are not actually doing any user account authentication we solved that like five
[9521.48 --> 9531.48]  or six years ago um and i'm sitting here going dude we've got like half a dozen people what are you
[9531.48 --> 9539.00]  even doing so yeah there's definitely opportunities there with companies that have money we just haven't
[9539.00 --> 9543.56]  developed that business because we're doing we're doing other stuff i i don't know what to tell you
[9543.56 --> 9549.56]  i i would i would love for floatplane to really take off but as it is it's it's still doing fine
[9549.56 --> 9555.40]  like we've got i think like 35 000 subscribers on floatplane right now to ltt alone we've got other
[9555.40 --> 9560.12]  creators on the platform um but it's just kind of doing its thing it's doing its thing
[9564.76 --> 9571.00]  uh yeah sure um hi friends it's my husband's birthday on the third and he always listens to the
[9571.00 --> 9576.52]  the wan show on podcast could you give him a shout out he wishes there was more wan show throughout the week
[9577.96 --> 9585.16]  well it would help if you told me his name um but hey i'm gonna do this the best way that i can
[9585.80 --> 9589.40]  um shout out mikaela m's husband
[9589.40 --> 9597.32]  so that's that that worked out great and i think oh we've got a problem
[9599.08 --> 9604.20]  oh no we do we do have a problem hold on i think i have a solution i can't push the button i think i
[9604.20 --> 9609.32]  think i have a solution it's illegal uh i i've got this i've got this hold on
[9609.32 --> 9620.52]  uh hey we've got a bit of a problem what all right thanks for tuning into the wan show we'll see
[9620.52 --> 9636.28]  you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye thanks lup bye
[9639.32 --> 9651.16]  you
