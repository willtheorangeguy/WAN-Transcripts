[0.80 → 8.66] What is up everyone? Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show. It's going to be a very exciting show for you guys today.
[8.82 → 17.50] We've got, of course, the big controversy this week. Why is it that YouTubers keep killing perfectly innocent companies?
[17.70 → 18.20] How could they?
[18.28 → 22.72] What did those companies ever do to these YouTubers? They're so cruel and awful.
[22.96 → 28.80] We've also got an extremely special guest this week, the one and only Jim Keller.
[28.80 → 32.14] I'll give you guys a bit of a longer introduction right after the intro.
[32.32 → 37.02] Now Luke gets, I mean, I'm sure there's something else that's going to excite the people.
[39.20 → 40.12] He's trying.
[40.60 → 43.84] I don't know, man. The spiffing Brits PC needed repairs?
[44.54 → 45.72] Oh, you went right for...
[45.72 → 46.54] What did you do?
[46.62 → 48.38] What did my heart do to you?
[48.60 → 52.04] Why did you feel the need to jab something into it and twist?
[52.14 → 53.66] Build a questionable computer.
[53.66 → 54.90] Did I destroy your company?
[54.90 → 55.26] I think that's what you did.
[55.26 → 59.14] I don't know about that.
[59.40 → 61.94] And Boston Dynamics has a crazy new robot.
[62.14 → 65.40] And of course, of course, in Boston Dynamics style, they had to release...
[65.40 → 65.70] It's a horse.
[65.90 → 67.82] ...an absolutely psychotic video about it.
[67.84 → 70.80] Oh, you're going to say, of course, of course, and it's not going to be a horse?
[71.24 → 73.54] I missed the video, so I didn't know what it was.
[73.64 → 74.92] I mean, they have a dog.
[75.62 → 76.36] It's not a horse.
[76.40 → 76.98] I just assumed it would...
[76.98 → 77.90] It's more like humanoid.
[77.90 → 80.06] I'm messing with you.
[80.10 → 81.32] I know what it looks like.
[81.32 → 81.82] I'm clarifying for the audience.
[82.94 → 84.08] They need to know things.
[84.90 → 85.64] I already rolled it.
[86.70 → 87.60] They can still hear us.
[87.94 → 88.82] I know, but barely.
[89.04 → 89.60] It's this music.
[89.60 → 89.68] It's this music.
[89.68 → 105.84] The show is brought to you today by MSI, Squarespace, and Messi.
[106.02 → 111.58] I'm going to spare him having to turn red while we talk about his illustrious career.
[111.58 → 117.16] But, of course, our guest this week is the one and only Jim Keller, current CEO of Tense
[117.16 → 121.62] Torrent, co-founder of Atomic Semi, whose notable work includes...
[121.62 → 124.80] And brace yourselves, because this is a bit of a list.
[125.14 → 130.74] He was the lead architect of the AMD K8 microarchitecture and co-designed the x86-64 instruction set.
[130.94 → 137.16] He was later the lead designer on the Zen architecture that catapulted AMD back to relevance and now
[137.16 → 138.16] more than.
[138.16 → 143.42] He helped design the Apple A4 and A5, the company's first in-house SOC.
[143.70 → 147.40] He's the former VP of Autopilot Hardware Engineering at Tesla.
[147.54 → 152.10] More recently, he left Intel in 2020 following a dispute.
[152.46 → 161.24] We don't need to get into the exact details of that, but joined Tense Torrent as CTO the same year and became CEO in January 2023.
[161.24 → 176.30] In 2023, he also co-founded Atomic Semi, a foundry that's focused on designing and manufacturing low-cost fabrication equipment, which is something I have to admit had flown under my radar, and I'm definitely going to want to ask a little bit more about.
[176.82 → 180.22] And without further ado, thank you for coming on the show.
[180.22 → 184.58] There he is!
[184.68 → 186.80] Hey, thank you so much and welcome!
[190.08 → 193.84] I'm struggling to impede and smash your enthusiasm.
[195.08 → 195.92] Pretty good.
[196.24 → 197.00] I think we all do.
[197.06 → 197.42] It's okay.
[198.10 → 205.28] Realistically, look, I usually have to sell it a little, but I am genuinely extremely excited to have you on the show.
[205.28 → 212.88] They asked me when I got on the phone with your team because we reached out when we saw the dev kit that you guys have right now.
[212.96 → 214.48] So this is on the Tense Torrent side.
[215.10 → 221.02] And I was like, okay, obviously, whatever Jim's working on is probably cool as shit.
[221.56 → 224.20] So maybe there's something here.
[224.28 → 225.22] And so I scheduled a call.
[225.34 → 226.66] It's just an exploratory call.
[226.70 → 228.30] And they go, oh, well, you know, do you want to talk to Jim?
[228.30 → 233.74] And I'm like, well, we don't really take guests on our show anymore, but yes.
[233.86 → 234.50] We'll make an exception.
[235.32 → 236.34] That would be great.
[236.48 → 236.64] Wow.
[237.46 → 241.76] I don't want to waste anyone's time, which is actually a big part of the reason we don't take guests.
[241.88 → 245.36] We are notorious for starting our show anywhere from one to three hours late.
[246.06 → 249.22] And we hate doing that to important people.
[249.68 → 253.76] So without further ado, I want to get into some of the community submitted questions.
[253.88 → 255.50] We announced that you were going to be joining us.
[255.50 → 258.56] And it would have been a huge disappointment if you weren't here, but you are.
[258.92 → 267.62] So Dylan asks, hey, Jim, I'm a junior computer engineering student about to start my first internship doing verification engineering at a big chimp company.
[267.72 → 269.64] First, did I just say chimp company?
[270.16 → 271.18] Anywho, doesn't matter.
[271.26 → 272.90] The point is congratulations, Dylan.
[273.80 → 277.74] He says, it's great to see how far open source has gone.
[278.22 → 281.58] We even learned RISC-V in our introductory hardware course.
[281.92 → 282.32] Oh, cool.
[282.32 → 290.88] So first, I want to start with letting you talk about RISC-V a little bit, because that's obviously a hugely important part of what Tense Torrent is doing right now.
[291.24 → 294.28] And I guess I realized I didn't really talk about Tense Torrent at all.
[294.34 → 299.62] So do you want to give us a short introduction to what exactly drew you to this company and to their mission?
[301.74 → 302.14] Wow.
[302.14 → 302.50] Okay.
[302.80 → 305.36] So Tense Torrent is an AI computer design company.
[305.98 → 310.86] We're designing a high-end AI engine and also a high-end RISC-V processor.
[312.24 → 317.40] And I think, yeah, AI has gone through a lot of evolution.
[318.30 → 320.84] And, you know, it started running on CPUs and then GPUs.
[320.84 → 324.80] And then I think Google announced the Tensor processor in 2015.
[325.68 → 334.92] And we're building essentially an array of Tensor processors that's programmable with open source software stock that we released in January.
[334.92 → 342.00] And then there's going to be a combination of AI computing and general purpose computing tied together.
[342.34 → 344.74] And we decided to make a high-end RISC-V processor.
[345.66 → 352.78] Our AI processor also uses little RISC-V cores, you know, to drive the execution of the big tensor processor.
[353.92 → 354.10] So?
[354.10 → 363.96] And, yeah, so the RISC-V thing is fascinating because, you know, at some level, computer architectures are generic.
[364.42 → 371.34] It doesn't really matter very much if it's x86, PowerPC, MIPS, Alpha, ARM, or RISC-V.
[371.84 → 373.42] But only RISC-V is open.
[374.12 → 377.30] And the Berkeley guys that started it were pretty good.
[377.30 → 385.70] And the cool thing about open source, you know, we saw with Linux is when it's open source, a bunch of people can work on it.
[385.84 → 388.26] It's a much better innovation platform.
[389.52 → 391.26] And it's a one-way door.
[392.16 → 396.64] When people go from, you know, proprietary technology to open source, they literally never go back.
[397.62 → 401.12] Linux killed literally all the proprietary Unix operating systems.
[401.82 → 406.74] And I think solely RISC-V is going to take over the computing world, which is pretty fun.
[407.30 → 408.56] Just want to say.
[408.66 → 409.60] To your student friends.
[410.70 → 411.30] Go ahead.
[411.80 → 416.68] I was just going to say, if I'm one of those Berkeley guys, I'm putting Jim Keller said I'm pretty good on my LinkedIn.
[417.54 → 418.32] Like, immediately.
[419.80 → 420.50] That's awesome.
[420.56 → 420.88] Yeah, they're pretty good.
[422.64 → 431.94] Well, yeah, I could tell funny stories about, like, you know, computer science in universities and computer science in high-end computer design companies.
[431.94 → 434.34] They kind of work together.
[434.34 → 440.60] And it's fascinating because a team of 100 people who work together for five years can refine that crap out of something.
[441.82 → 446.58] Whereas students, you know, they get a project and sometimes without that much support.
[447.12 → 449.02] And some of those projects are pretty good.
[449.02 → 452.68] And some of them, it's hard for it to add up to a lot, let's say.
[453.24 → 454.20] So you've...
[454.20 → 457.98] But like the branch predictors everybody uses came out of universities.
[458.52 → 466.08] And RISC-V architecture, which is going to, let's say, dominate computing in 10 years, came out of universities.
[466.48 → 471.72] And now there are 20-odd companies building RISC-V computers and way more using it.
[471.72 → 472.72] So, yeah, it's pretty wild for them.
[472.72 → 479.60] Whether you did it on purpose or whether you did it by accident, you actually transitioned me perfectly into the second half of Dylan's question.
[479.88 → 486.06] And this is really cool because he asked for getting into a higher-level architect slash designer position.
[486.06 → 493.52] If you want to work on one of those teams, are you going to recommend stay in school, go for the PhD, or do you want years in industry?
[493.62 → 494.58] What are you looking for?
[496.58 → 496.94] I...
[496.94 → 497.72] Well...
[497.72 → 501.22] So, PhDs are perfect for some people.
[501.72 → 506.90] If you really have a research topic, and you really want to go think really hard.
[507.80 → 511.34] But if you want, like, I didn't study computer design in college.
[511.72 → 513.02] I'm an electrical engineer.
[513.84 → 516.86] You know, my major is first electromagnetic fields.
[517.52 → 519.84] And then when I...
[519.84 → 523.40] My advisor ran the semiconductor physics lab.
[523.88 → 525.58] So I learned a lot about that.
[525.70 → 528.04] And then I took one logic design course.
[528.54 → 530.30] And then got a job doing that.
[530.30 → 531.98] And then I got a job at digital.
[532.48 → 534.32] Where I worked for a great architect.
[534.92 → 535.68] Bob Stewart.
[536.64 → 541.02] And then computer architects, good ones, know about a lot of different things.
[541.70 → 543.54] So I learned how to program.
[544.08 → 545.18] You know, do a lot of design.
[545.86 → 547.52] I know about semiconductor physics.
[547.52 → 554.28] I know a weird amount about packaging and, you know, signal integrity and all kinds of stuff.
[555.44 → 558.90] And so if you want to be a computer architect, you should probably work on a lot of different things.
[559.18 → 565.26] And most computer architects that are perfect at it didn't do it in college, you know, as a PhD.
[565.26 → 571.92] Interestingly enough, it's almost like a too narrow of a way to go about it.
[572.16 → 574.08] PhD guys tend to be experts in something.
[575.52 → 578.96] And computer architects tend to be generalists, I'd say.
[579.44 → 579.60] Yeah.
[579.60 → 583.64] So you already kind of alluded to this one as well.
[583.84 → 587.80] But William asks, I mean, you've obviously got experience on the arm side.
[587.92 → 590.04] You've got experience on the x86 side.
[590.14 → 592.26] You've got experience on the RISC-V side.
[593.86 → 598.10] William asks, how far do you think x86-64 can go?
[598.52 → 599.68] I mean, you're telling me now.
[599.78 → 602.24] You're saying, look, RISC-V is going to be the future.
[602.38 → 603.56] You gave that number 10 years.
[603.78 → 605.10] I'm not going to hold you to it.
[605.10 → 608.38] I mean, I can't promise nobody else will, but I'm not going to hold you to it.
[609.08 → 612.94] Is that because x86 is out of gas?
[613.16 → 621.00] Or is it because RISC-V has just got some kind of fuel that we're only just discovering the potential for in the engine?
[621.14 → 622.14] Which one is it?
[623.52 → 623.94] Neither.
[625.52 → 631.70] So computers generically, you know, they fetch instructions, decode them, and issue them.
[632.36 → 632.80] Right.
[632.80 → 638.38] And the thing that makes the front end of a computer fast is how many instructions can you decode,
[638.74 → 641.16] and how well can you predict the instruction stream?
[642.24 → 642.38] Right.
[642.44 → 648.76] So x86 has a deficit in the sense that, you know, random length instructions are harder to predict,
[648.88 → 650.18] but we sort of figured that out.
[650.26 → 651.46] It's just harder to do.
[652.08 → 653.98] But it's not like a big limitation.
[653.98 → 661.00] And then the execution engine goes fast because you have lots of parallel execution units and out of order issue,
[661.12 → 663.00] which is generic to computers.
[663.68 → 669.72] And then you have a good memory system with a perfect predictor for where the data is coming from,
[670.22 → 672.06] which has nothing to do with your architecture.
[672.06 → 676.04] So I'd say x86 has a limitation.
[676.76 → 680.12] So it's 16 registers, variable length instruction set,
[680.58 → 684.86] and it sort of has a pile of old crud that nobody actually needs, but you have to build.
[685.60 → 687.14] So it has a tax.
[687.88 → 688.02] Right.
[688.02 → 692.18] But computer performance is mostly today based on prediction.
[693.26 → 696.02] And the number of predictors in a modern computer is crazy.
[696.84 → 701.68] We predict, obviously, like where the instruction stream is coming from, where the next branch is,
[702.20 → 704.44] the direction of the branch called return stack.
[704.58 → 707.28] We predict the width and grouping of instructions.
[707.58 → 709.72] We sometimes predict the results of instructions.
[710.12 → 711.74] So tell me this.
[712.16 → 713.44] We can predict where the data is coming from.
[714.08 → 714.90] So it's all a prediction.
[714.90 → 719.30] One of the follow-up questions from William is, you know,
[719.38 → 720.90] could we see cores using multiple architectures?
[721.64 → 725.82] Could you see someone like an Intel or an AMD, an x86 license holder,
[726.34 → 733.34] taking some kind of RISC-V architecture AI processor, coprocessor, and using that for prediction?
[734.98 → 737.20] Like an AI accelerant on a traditional...
[737.20 → 738.52] Does it just not make any sense?
[738.62 → 739.22] I mean, tell me.
[739.36 → 740.98] If it's a dumb question, I'd love to know.
[742.34 → 743.90] It probably doesn't make very much sense.
[743.90 → 749.52] So computers are very optimized around, you know, a particular instruction set.
[750.34 → 753.88] Today, there's pretty good binary translators, and they keep getting better.
[754.88 → 755.90] And binary translation...
[755.90 → 756.30] ...
[756.30 → 756.90] ...
[756.90 → 757.90] ...
[757.90 → 758.90] ...
[758.90 → 759.90] ...
[759.90 → 760.90] ...
[760.90 → 761.90] ...
[761.90 → 762.90] ...
[762.90 → 763.90] ...
[763.90 → 764.90] ...
[764.90 → 765.90] ...
