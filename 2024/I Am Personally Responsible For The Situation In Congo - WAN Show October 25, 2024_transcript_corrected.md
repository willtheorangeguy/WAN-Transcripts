[0.00 → 7.36] to when show where I have blood on my hands what a criminal according to someone's I think
[7.36 → 16.06] high school teacher I have the blood of people on my hands um and I am personally what is this
[16.06 → 22.68] well, well we'll talk about it, we'll get into it apparently I am like really really terrible
[22.68 → 28.26] though, and it's got a lot of votes on Reddit with people kind of weighing in on this teacher's
[28.26 → 35.52] take on uh my peddling of tech tips on the internet and other news uh much actually more on topic news
[35.52 → 43.82] telecoms hate her we're talking of course about Lena khan uh dude click to cancel okay so making
[43.82 → 48.90] it is easier for people to cancel subscriptions um trade groups representing the telecom industry
[48.90 → 53.34] not happy about it, we're going to be talking about that what else we got this week airlines embrace
[53.34 → 58.18] Starlink and who it sounds like it's a lot better than what we've had in the past but
[58.18 → 62.72] you know we'll talk about that later also Squarespace goes private this might not make
[62.72 → 67.90] a lot of sense to be all that interesting but remember they just bought google domains
[67.90 → 70.92] oh no
[70.92 → 96.82] the show today is brought to you by jump cloud fallout 76 and flex spot with our chair partner
[96.82 → 104.36] secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner brand why don't we jump right into our
[104.36 → 113.50] title topic today which is of course that Linus is personally hurting children in the Congo
[113.50 → 122.00] um Linus has blood on his hands children in actually uh Democratic Republic of the Congo I think is the
[122.00 → 128.12] proper term but sure whatever um work for less than two dollars a day so he can sell you tech tips
[128.12 → 134.20] it is a requirement if they don't work for two dollars a day or less you're actually legally
[134.20 → 141.06] not allowed to give anyone tech tips don't let tech influencers sway you into gross consumerism
[141.06 → 152.66] buy less tech and end the suffering in Congo uh so according to the poster on Reddit um let's see if I can
[152.66 → 161.56] actually find anything from the op here uh yeah no well anyway uh there 's's a lot to kind of
[161.56 → 163.40] unpack here um
[163.40 → 163.44] um
[163.44 → 176.14] you guys can probably hear that short aside Marty from mighty car mods and a bunch of uh his friends
[176.14 → 183.02] are here this week working on a collab we took proof's car to a completely new level so look forward
[183.02 → 190.06] to that video soon uh that was probably the car like going somewhere, and it's not close to us right now
[190.06 → 198.48] it's got a cosmetic muffler is I believe the uh the term for it the cosmetic muffler anyway
[198.48 → 206.26] uh the point is there's a lot to unpack here and I'm going to stun everyone including probably my co-host
[206.26 → 210.68] my producer and all of you watching by saying I don't fundamentally disagree
[210.68 → 222.94] okay but hold on okay hold on so I've actually had this conversation uh internally uh before
[222.94 → 230.14] but not this specific one but in this case it was uh it was more along the lines of
[230.14 → 237.68] um sort of discussing the impact of our business environmentally more broadly you know uh we
[237.68 → 244.84] we create oh that that's not our product again we create um merch items you know we have things
[244.84 → 253.42] manufactured uh we sell them uh we burn jet fuel shipping them around the world um we obviously are
[253.42 → 259.10] as we burn jet fuel shipping ourselves across the world yeah yeah we do um in cases where realistically
[259.10 → 264.58] we could have found out just as much about the product on a Zoom call um instead you know we
[264.58 → 271.50] we fly somewhere we eat food up in a mile in the air because you know that is where you should eat
[271.50 → 276.16] food instead of eating it in your home it's harvested sitting on your webcam somewhere else moved to an
[276.16 → 280.90] airport put in a plane and shipped somewhere else with you to eat and so running the business
[280.90 → 288.62] that we do uh we oh man we build sets right these are structures that do not house
[288.62 → 295.06] anybody yeah right we buy technology and I think this is part of the point that's being made with
[295.06 → 302.70] this slide we buy technology products that contain uh precious materials like cobalt and lithium um in
[302.70 → 312.40] some cases you know very controversially obtained materials right and don't even use them sometimes we
[312.40 → 317.32] have a warehouse of devices that are sitting not being used you know you could easily look at our
[317.32 → 323.72] business and go okay well you guys have an enormous carbon footprint you guys have an enormous
[323.72 → 328.32] environmental impact um so I understand
[328.32 → 336.36] oh boy I think that was across the front of the building I think so I think that was fairly close
[336.36 → 343.48] I understand where this point is coming from and I actually think it comes from a pretty good
[343.48 → 354.48] place we are a marketing company right we are a production company um and part of our job is to sell things
[354.48 → 359.82] right fundamentally right I mean we're gonna we're going to give you guys a pitch for our new tech bro vest
[359.82 → 368.32] later on in this very podcast um however I do think that there are degrees to which you can mitigate
[368.32 → 376.40] some of the damage and I do think that singling out me as you know the tech influencer who has blood on his
[376.40 → 384.80] hands uh seems a little misguided given my history of promoting the three r's of promoting right to
[384.80 → 392.60] repair of principally standing behind those things that I promote when it comes to things like
[392.60 → 399.48] investments in framework who is legitimately doing real work to make devices last was not done on a
[399.48 → 405.58] framework laptop oh yeah that's a good point it was done on a Chromebook yeah probably just about
[405.58 → 412.30] the most disposable kind of laptop computer that you can purchase yeah um, and so I think that's
[412.30 → 419.14] something that is maybe some nuance that is missing in this take is that realistically you are going to
[419.14 → 427.32] need clothes you are going to need a computer um if you want to you know not get arrested for being
[427.32 → 433.26] naked everywhere and if you want to have a job you know in the year 2024 yeah a lot of modern life is
[433.26 → 439.74] done through computing and a big part of our job is to make sure that when you buy those clothes they
[439.74 → 444.92] last for a really long time and when you buy that computer it's one that actually suits your needs
[444.92 → 451.48] properly instead of being manufactured e-waste there is so much more waste involved in buying
[451.48 → 456.60] something and then it just being a piece of junk that should have never been manufactured in the
[456.60 → 462.40] first place supporting that industry instead of just supporting companies that build a high quality
[462.40 → 467.08] product that's made to last in the first place which is what we obviously strive to help people
[467.08 → 473.26] find we don't nail everything we are not perfect we are in fact human it turns out but what I would
[473.26 → 480.56] ask than to this uh teacher whatever grade whatever class this is on something English yeah okay this
[480.56 → 484.52] is an English class I don't see how this is particularly on topic, but anyway it doesn't
[484.52 → 490.04] matter what's going on it doesn't matter the point is here's what I would ask um how would you do it
[490.04 → 500.38] what would your media company do then right like in order for you to provide people advice so
[500.38 → 508.08] should they just should, they not have a phone and if they do have a phone which do you have a phone
[508.08 → 513.84] how do you decide which one to buy so I think there are particular bits of uh people say the
[513.84 → 517.72] website links to your store I've I've typed in a bunch of times I've never had to go to this store but
[517.72 → 523.88] um i I think it's a's saying is it a media literacy thing I think it might be that I think it
[523.88 → 529.56] might be a display of like a potential form of like propaganda or something I don't think it's
[529.56 → 536.40] necessarily actually legit um but uh so something I've been thinking about though is like i immediately
[536.40 → 540.38] pointed out when this was first linked to me and I thought it might have been real um i immediately
[540.38 → 546.34] pointed out scrapyard wars because like we started that super early on in the history of the
[546.34 → 558.98] company realistically in in regard to like series that we have um and let's see that does work
[558.98 → 568.62] um we started it super, super early on in the history of our company um and its whole idea
[568.62 → 573.60] was showing that you don't have to buy new computer components you can reuse someone else's that they're
[573.60 → 579.88] trying to get rid of right that was like not going to lie I may have just been post bamboozled oh yeah
[579.88 → 582.04] you guys were not going to tell me
[582.04 → 590.00] may have misspelt it and somebody else bought the domain and made it link there
[590.00 → 596.26] that makes way more sense because i I saw this on Reddit before it was in the topics
[596.26 → 603.10] no okay let's get you guys up to date so the uh the URL in the slide
[603.10 → 609.16] redirects to lttstore.com which would seem to suggest that it's a post but I saw this when it
[609.16 → 615.16] first showed up on Reddit and the op was replying to people no this guy's actually for real oh okay and
[615.16 → 621.18] yeah it's a typo it's its a completely different site it's supposed to be like friends of the Congo
[621.18 → 627.42] yeah, yeah so no, no no, no this is real it's really okay I thought it was just supposed to because like no
[627.42 → 633.62] there was it seems like it should be just like a take because teachers did stuff like that when I was in school
[633.62 → 638.78] they would try to like rile you up on something and then get you make an argument about it or whatever else
[638.78 → 644.40] yeah no it actually does not seem to it does not actually seem to be wow that's fantastic yeah um so
[644.40 → 649.72] we have specific series scrapyard wars where we show that you know you don't have to buy new tech
[649.72 → 655.22] to get your foot in the door in regard to tech you can even get really high performance good stuff
[655.22 → 660.78] by buying used things we have compensator which shows not only do you know not have to buy new
[660.78 → 665.64] tech but also just buying the most expensive stuff is pretty stupid kind of actually just stupid
[665.64 → 671.96] doesn't have a benefit yeah we call it a compensator right we're we're we're making fun of it um spending
[671.96 → 678.42] that kind of money just for show just to have the most expensive thing um the values on our
[678.42 → 684.86] channel have always been about finding bang for the buck finding a good value recently you started
[684.86 → 690.42] just repairing broken things yeah that's showing how like effective and valuable that is
[690.42 → 695.16] however I'm gonna again play devil's advocate there are counters against my own channel yeah
[695.16 → 703.70] why did we make a video on the 115-inch TV that again I invested heavily in fuel to be transported
[703.70 → 711.24] all the way from China uh so that I could, you know install in my house creating a know shrine to
[711.24 → 719.80] media consumption like it's a well whatever right my point is just that people can be influenced in a
[719.80 → 724.00] lot of different ways and even if I say at the end of the video yeah this isn't a great value, and it's not
[724.00 → 731.44] something that I'd recommend for most people um it aspirationally people might watch that and go like
[731.44 → 737.52] oh but I'd like to I'd like to have something like that right so I think you could make an argument
[737.52 → 746.24] that I do participate in sort of um maybe not glorifying but certainly making consumption seem
[746.24 → 749.18] attractive or attainable or desirable
[749.18 → 761.12] I don't know I think being interested in technology is not inherently like a sin
[761.12 → 769.20] and I think seeing the bounds of it is entertaining and interesting, and you could see this
[769.20 → 775.24] massive TV like I see that TV and I don't want it like you're not telling people you should want this you
[775.24 → 780.20] should go buy this you're actually showing how complicated and annoying it was to get and things
[780.20 → 784.68] like that I think sometimes it comes down to the messaging um you're not actively recommending that
[784.68 → 787.16] people buy it no I'm not but like
[787.16 → 801.16] I don't know it's I definitely see how if you're a fitness influencer sure you are automatically going to
[801.16 → 809.96] be you know communicating the positives of buying stuff are you though yeah what if you're a
[809.96 → 815.08] fitness influencer who focuses entirely on calisthenics darn it I thought about that as you were going into
[815.08 → 821.32] it got him destroyed yeah people like stay flex are pretty good for that kind of stuff yeah if you're
[821.32 → 826.28] if you're is you're an I don't know okay gym come on come on because workout equipment is
[826.28 → 829.72] expensive it's really heavy no you're going to have to give me something other than fitness you're gonna
[829.72 → 835.32] find a different vertical find a different vertical automotive I mean we can hear it outside
[835.32 → 842.20] I think automotive is actually an even easier argue to make for just the unnecessariness of that
[842.20 → 846.28] entire of that entire space personal transportation but what if you talk about
[846.28 → 851.72] done a lot of damage to the world what if you talk about things like repairing what if you talk
[851.72 → 859.80] about things like don't have a car and take a bike or the bus then i I think you could, I think
[859.80 → 864.60] you can make a pretty easy argument there that you should be doing your part to improve the viability
[864.60 → 868.92] of that rather than just accepting things the way that they are what about the people that are in
[868.92 → 873.96] situations where they cannot do anything other than have a vehicle realistically there is no
[873.96 → 881.56] safe alternative find me a channel that has only ever done that then i I don't think that's out
[881.56 → 889.16] there yeah the the ethical personal transportation ownership channel there is no ethical
[889.16 → 895.32] consumption under in my opinion effectively any human system so it just is what it is
[897.32 → 901.48] people how to make up for their own makeup for themselves what is okay and what isn't okay
[901.48 → 910.28] so basically the person who made this slide did it on a laptop that has a fat battery in it that
[910.28 → 915.40] probably has a bunch of cobalt in it yeah could have done it on something that didn't involve batteries
[915.40 → 921.24] they could have done it on an overhead projector, but they didn't do that so I think in short they
[921.24 → 926.84] almost certainly have a phone I understand where the teacher's coming from I understand the argument
[926.84 → 935.56] um I understand that you're almost making the so you hate society why do you participate in it
[935.56 → 941.16] why do you participate in an argument which is no, no no I'm saying that this type of argument doesn't
[941.16 → 945.56] really hold a lot of water for me when that's the case if there are you know there are channels out
[945.56 → 950.76] there are influencers out there that are very much pushy for consumerism that is a thing I don't
[950.76 → 956.36] think we necessarily are I think we have certain content that can maybe push the line a little bit
[956.36 → 963.96] sure I think stuff spend five grand on your room yeah yeah yeah I can see that can maybe push the line
[963.96 → 968.36] a little bit I don't think it always does though yeah in fairness to us, I mean that's more driven by
[968.36 → 973.56] that individual yeah because they pick exactly what they want other than making sure there's one
[973.56 → 980.44] product from the series sponsor which is AMD right now yeah so like but I think we also
[980.44 → 985.32] balance it out quite well by like you know when a phone comes out we're not like oh my god buy the
[985.32 → 990.36] new phone it's amazing we're like you know if you have last generation's phone this is probably
[990.36 → 995.00] not worthy of an upgrade because phones aren't moving that fast right now, and you're probably fine
[995.00 → 999.00] and we you know I mean look at the most two recent CPU reviews
[1001.72 → 1008.04] you're probably fine you a gamer all right put your wallet away you can sit this one out yeah
[1009.00 → 1015.72] uh yeah I don't know like I don't I don't think that we just push consume consume consume i yeah
[1015.72 → 1022.52] okay so tell me this one of the things that this made me think of was um Taylor Swift
[1025.72 → 1033.32] yeah so taylor gets a lot of for her private jet use jet travel okay yeah yeah yeah
[1033.32 → 1041.88] yeah and I think that there is i personally i i i I don't fly private um I don't even fly first
[1041.88 → 1049.56] class I mean come on look at the size of my legs do I need more legroom not really um so you know i
[1049.56 → 1056.12] kind of look at private air travel and I'm like um yeah it doesn't seem great you know the sheer
[1056.12 → 1063.80] amount of fuel consumption also like in in in Taylor's defence yeah you imagine Taylor sitting
[1063.80 → 1071.32] on a normal plane the attacks genuine attacks that she would probably be subject to insane she would
[1071.32 → 1079.00] probably have to buy like the 10 seat radius around her for her security guard anyway so hold on
[1079.00 → 1082.36] hold on, and then she's just going to get chirped at the whole time what do you mean we're not on a
[1082.36 → 1089.56] first name basis gallery, and she just only has a first name Mrs swift share okay Madonna Taylor she's
[1089.56 → 1097.56] earned it okay the point is that so so so one of the arguments that I often see so I have my own
[1097.56 → 1103.32] thoughts on private travel I don't feel it's necessary for me in any kind of security way and
[1103.32 → 1111.24] and I'm not I'm not super keen on it, I don't think it's great for the world um however one of the
[1111.24 → 1118.36] arguments that I see made very often about her is oh my god look at all the private jet travel she's
[1118.36 → 1126.36] doing and the many tons of co2 that she creates compared to the average person so we're recruiting
[1126.36 → 1131.88] the sixties to help us against this teacher no, no no that's not that's not my point is
[1132.84 → 1138.12] that's always something that has bothered me because I have an alternate perspective on that if you think
[1138.12 → 1143.40] about what someone like Taylor Swift is doing in her private jet what is she doing where is she going
[1144.68 → 1150.52] usually concert like yeah on tour places to have concerts you can actually there's like a tracker
[1150.52 → 1155.16] that shows like you know everywhere she flew and there's obviously some stuff that's a little
[1155.16 → 1161.72] unnecessary like did she have to go from overseas to every one of Travis Kelce's you know games last
[1161.72 → 1166.84] playoffs or whatever uh I don't know maybe not you know maybe she could have watched it on TV I don't
[1166.84 → 1171.48] I bet you would have if you could maybe that was an option i and that's that's the thing to think
[1171.48 → 1175.72] about for yourself, but that's a separate conversation the point is in general where is she going she's
[1175.72 → 1180.04] probably going on tour and there's a lot of kind of if you look at the travel patterns there's a
[1180.04 → 1185.48] lot of kind of like going back and forth to places uh probably for you know rehearsal this and transport
[1185.48 → 1189.72] the bandmates and equipment you know whatever else it is it does a lot of like ferrying things around
[1190.36 → 1194.84] and it's wild to me that you can just track private planes but anyway and so all of that co2
[1194.84 → 1199.48] kind of gets attributed to Taylor Swift, and it's like look at this number look at the average person
[1199.48 → 1203.56] but here's an argument what about the people who attended the concert
[1206.20 → 1211.48] do they own a share of those emissions they're paying for her to go there they're they're
[1211.48 → 1217.72] financially asking her to do that why the is she there she wouldn't be there if nobody asked her to
[1217.72 → 1221.72] be there and paid good money for her to be there yeah armies I'm just your fault no I'm just
[1221.72 → 1229.64] yeah you're the reason scene says wanting things so is Taylor responsible for all the people who
[1229.64 → 1237.00] travel to see her in concert exactly yes am I responsible for all the people who buy some
[1237.00 → 1247.48] phone yeah or some laptop of course not what what what do you mean so let's go me and Taylor you know
[1247.48 → 1253.24] we're we're we're of a kind you know you guys are close we're not actually responsible for the
[1253.24 → 1259.64] bullshit that people do because they I don't know think we're cool a lot more of them think she's
[1259.64 → 1264.44] cool but i i was just trying to find a link I was just trying to find a link I have one thing in
[1264.44 → 1273.16] common with Taylor Swift now your last name starts with us that's two dang, dang we're getting there
[1273.16 → 1280.84] now you just need to release a country album uh yeah maybe not you don't you don't want to listen
[1280.84 → 1291.00] to that this would be awful she thinks my processor's sexy what are you even reading my tractor sexy
[1291.00 → 1296.84] my tractor the song I don't know I don't know the song okay yeah yeah yeah maybe a Christmas album
[1296.84 → 1301.16] good you have released an album that's true you're both singer-songwriters
[1305.88 → 1312.92] twenties oh man yeah next time you see her you're just going to be like what up twin man i I think we
[1312.92 → 1315.96] talked about this on land show before but do you remember when the news broke that she was a
[1315.96 → 1322.04] billionaire and everyone was like oh my god Taylor's a billionaire and I was like surprised and I was
[1322.04 → 1332.20] sitting here going like okay has been for a while yeah like based on what I know about my own
[1332.20 → 1342.52] situation and based on the fact that i I am this and Taylor Swift is this like I'm sure yeah uh yeah
[1342.52 → 1349.72] we're both blonde let's go we're getting there oh man this is turning into a whole topic what do i
[1349.72 → 1354.76] have in common with Taylor's how many degrees of separation is Lennox and Taylor yeah probably
[1354.76 → 1357.40] like one or two we both got kind of big thighs
[1360.12 → 1363.56] I'm not saying it's a bad thing I'm just saying we both got I didn't even know that
[1364.36 → 1369.80] have you seen the bodysuit she wears in the airs tour no you can tell how big her thighs I have not
[1369.80 → 1378.28] seen the arrows to her yeah like what what what bro's looking caught him dude
[1383.00 → 1391.96] Linus is Myron dude okay so what uh what I'm supposed I'm supposed to not notice it looks pretty normal
[1391.96 → 1394.20] yeah she's got thighs
[1397.40 → 1405.08] she's tall though uh yeah oh comparisons have limitations okay yeah okay let's move on uh
[1405.08 → 1407.32] topic number two what do you want to talk about next
[1411.88 → 1419.00] you got nothing I have to log back in so I got nothing uh Lena khan sure let's talk about someone who is
[1419.00 → 1426.36] sexy on the inside here because dude Lena khan what's happening absolutely based
[1426.36 → 1431.08] Lena khan is based i do agree Lena khan is based just don't talk about her thighs
[1433.24 → 1434.76] that's probably not appropriate
[1436.20 → 1437.40] I think we're killing Dan
[1437.96 → 1438.92] I'm losing
[1441.88 → 1447.16] anyway Lena khan is based trade groups representing the telecom industry are suing to stop the FTC's
[1447.16 → 1452.36] recently announced click to cancel rule which we all want uh which would require all subscription
[1452.36 → 1458.20] services to provide a means of cancelling that is at least as easy as sing up the complaint argues
[1458.20 → 1465.32] that the decision is a form of regulatory uh regulatory overreach that is arbitrary uh capricious
[1465.32 → 1472.04] and an abuse of discretion in other American regulatory news AT&T and T-Mobile have come out
[1472.04 → 1477.96] against a proposed FCC rule that would require that would require carriers to unlock phone 60 days
[1477.96 → 1483.72] after activation that sounds amazing uh so they can be switched to another carrier that's this is
[1483.72 → 1489.56] see we're promoting that because it's good for reuse um according to T-Mobile which locks prepaid
[1489.56 → 1497.96] phone for a year customers would be harmed by no longer having access to free or heavily subsidized
[1497.96 → 1506.76] handsets okay uh AT&T which locks phones for six months says that the move would create upward pressure
[1506.76 → 1515.96] on handset prices so here Mr high school teacher let me explain to you our position on this matter
[1515.96 → 1525.08] and how it's actually good for consumption we support this because heavily subsidized technology products
[1525.08 → 1533.32] encourage gratuitous consumption your old phone probably works and if the new phone cost more
[1533.32 → 1539.24] and by more I don't mean more I mean if it costs the amount it actually cost if you were actually
[1539.88 → 1546.36] not being expected to do the comp admittedly complicated math of how much is my monthly payment
[1546.36 → 1551.56] versus how much is my down payment on the device in the first place how much am I paying for it overall
[1551.56 → 1557.72] right if you actually saw the sticker price of that phone you would be more likely to keep your old
[1557.72 → 1567.96] one for longer and run on a longer upgrade cycle okay we are supportive of this because it would expose
[1567.96 → 1574.84] the true cost of a new handset to the consumer and probably reduce the overall sales of new mobile
[1574.84 → 1585.24] devices that is a good thing and yeah if you rely on heavily subsidized phones then that's a that's a
[1585.24 → 1591.72] downer, but you can get used ones but here's the thing if you rely on heavily subsidized phones you're still
[1591.72 → 1597.96] paying for them in the monthly you're paying for them in the monthly so what this will force is it will
[1597.96 → 1604.52] force the carriers to give you the real cost of the device, and then it will force them to compete
[1604.52 → 1609.56] on the cost of the monthly service which will ultimately drive your total cost of ownership
[1610.12 → 1617.96] down this is a good good good thing yeah and because I don't actually give two if you buy
[1617.96 → 1627.80] more phones I really don't I will of course support this let's go back to that first point though
[1627.96 → 1633.24] um trade groups representing the telecom industry uh are suing to stop the recently announced click
[1633.24 → 1639.08] to cancel so guys um this is something that if I know there's kind of a big election going on in our
[1639.08 → 1646.20] with our southern neighbours what is that in like good lord like 16 days or something like that um if you
[1646.20 → 1651.00] if you guys have any way maybe once the dust settles a little bit of making your voice heard to your
[1651.00 → 1657.88] local representative um click to cancel is outstanding and should be supported at every
[1657.88 → 1665.56] level of government by every citizen there is literally no one who should be who should be
[1665.56 → 1672.68] supportive of dark patterns and complicated like going in person to cancel gym memberships
[1672.68 → 1677.80] and stuff like that like dude uh so and basically what click to cancel means is whatever method you
[1677.80 → 1682.76] use to sign up you can use the same method to cancel it, but there 's's like gyms for example that
[1682.76 → 1688.36] are known for allowing you to sign up online give all your payment details and then if you want to
[1688.36 → 1692.76] cancel you have to like to go in person and do it so they intentionally put these obstacles in the way
[1692.76 → 1698.36] to make it more difficult for you to cancel the gym specifically want that because a lot of people feel
[1698.36 → 1707.00] shame about cancelling a gym membership in person and a lot of especially like corporate large multi-location
[1707.00 → 1713.00] franchise gyms have gyms all over the place so if you try to use excuses like oh I'm I'm moving or
[1713.00 → 1716.44] whatever they'll just be like oh yeah that's no problem we'll just transfer your membership to like
[1716.44 → 1723.00] the local gym in that area um so they try to do a lot of things to make sure that you feel
[1723.00 → 1728.76] shame in cancelling your gym membership uh which is icky gross oh apparently I got the election
[1728.76 → 1737.64] day wrong is it not the 11th sorry it's the fifth oh my goodness it's 10 days away all right so yeah
[1738.28 → 1745.72] get out there and do your thing my American friends this is now watched this drive sorry um
[1747.88 → 1753.48] this is uh this if I remember correctly this year has liked one of the highest concentrations of
[1753.48 → 1758.28] worldwide elections like ever kind of crazy yeah I think bc broke records recently
[1758.76 → 1763.16] um and turn out too people are turning out yeah, yeah like crazy had a weird one because like
[1763.16 → 1767.00] conservatives haven't been in power in bc if I remember correctly in like close to 100 years or
[1767.00 → 1771.72] something yeah, but our conservative party is a little complicated changed like yeah who would
[1771.72 → 1778.68] actually who it actually is like yeah well our liberate our oh my god did you see Christy Clark
[1779.88 → 1786.36] volunteered herself to run the federal liberals like I could do it nobody wants you to do that get out
[1786.36 → 1792.52] out of here literally nobody I will actually march me too i would do it I would as well like
[1793.00 → 1802.52] imagine okay we have Justin Trudeau very imperfect leader imagine being like you know
[1802.52 → 1815.96] what would be better corruption queen are you kidding me oh man yeah yeah actually
[1815.96 → 1823.24] worse and i i know for a lot of the people who only see like international headlines or like
[1823.96 → 1829.00] nonsense that their uncle posts on Facebook or whatever you probably can't imagine anything worse
[1829.00 → 1835.16] than Justin Trudeau yeah he's not he's super imperfect I'll put it that way um there are levels of
[1836.04 → 1841.24] self-dealing and corruption and he is only but an acolyte
[1841.24 → 1852.68] corruption you know that you know that meme like I'll do it again I feel like she's like
[1854.52 → 1862.12] but on a national scale dude the art you thought I did a lot with a province what about the country
[1862.92 → 1869.40] uh I should see if I can um I should see if I can find the article because it's so
[1869.40 → 1877.72] bad uh here we go hold on is what's this uh was this CTV news article as he as Justin Trudeau faces
[1877.72 → 1888.36] growing pressure um oh yeah oh this is amazing okay this article is so bad uh Clark served as bc
[1888.36 → 1894.36] premier between blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah um who appear Clark who appears on a weekly as
[1894.36 → 1899.24] weekly panellist on CTV's power play oh couldn't help noticing that that's um the publication I'm
[1899.24 → 1903.16] reading also released a separate statement on x and called for unity within the party to fight
[1903.16 → 1908.12] conservative leader her comments come ahead of a highly anticipated caucus meeting I'm a blah blah blah
[1908.12 → 1914.84] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay emerged uh et cetera oh wait no is this not the right
[1914.84 → 1919.24] one yeah what are we looking for hold on oh no I was looking for one that like basically was uh it
[1919.24 → 1925.40] basically talked about what she's been up to since she uh since she retired and no this isn't the one
[1925.40 → 1933.56] nope nope nope I take it back CTV you're doing good uh go ahead and uh and do your do a quick
[1933.56 → 1941.16] merch message or something there yeah sure I've got a couple for you here already with the oh no hold on
[1941.16 → 1947.24] you got to explain what it is and do your updates now Luke can do it all right uh if you go to lttstore.com
[1947.24 → 1952.76] if you add something to your cart like potentially a tech bro vest that we will talk about a little
[1952.76 → 1958.92] bit later you go and view the cart in the cart you'll be able to see this merch messages box if
[1958.92 → 1964.12] you check the box saying I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message on the LTT stream it's
[1964.12 → 1969.16] called stream not wan show because it's for the various streams that we do you can go in here and
[1969.16 → 1976.12] leave a message for the show at which point it will be curated by uh by Dan to either be responded to
[1976.12 → 1983.00] by Dan as you'll probably see down here um as a response to this one uh or if you say super
[1983.00 → 1987.56] bad things that aren't allowed to show up on stream because you included bad words we'll yeet it, or it'll
[1987.56 → 1994.12] be curated by Dan for Linus or me to answer sure let's see normally what he says something like
[1994.12 → 2002.36] that I think he's a little worse at it but okay I'm listening oh crap he's still here um let's see with
[2002.36 → 2008.52] the mention of the chair partner laptop partner and d brand and Pia during after dark the number
[2008.52 → 2014.60] of ads in wan show technically doubled do you have an internal limit or policy on how much is too much
[2016.20 → 2018.60] I think we need four times as much
[2021.56 → 2025.48] I don't think we technically do I think over the course of a show that often goes for like four
[2025.48 → 2030.68] hours I think a very small amount of mentions at the beginning of the show and then three not very
[2030.68 → 2034.20] long mentions in the middle of the show is really not a big deal personally
[2037.56 → 2044.28] I agree with this merch message too many sponsors uh someone said in float plane chat um it when people
[2044.28 → 2052.28] consider the merch messages section at the end of the show to be a sponsor section then I can understand
[2052.28 → 2058.92] that um I also have heard some people's comments about the banner at the bottom being too busy
[2058.92 → 2065.08] and I think I can sometimes maybe agree, but these types of things take tuning we'll figure it out
[2065.72 → 2073.56] yeah yeah I'd say so uh what else I got maybe there's something here for Luke I think I remember one
[2073.56 → 2087.56] all right one moment I know I've got one here for Luke um hey when my favourite flavour of DLL pickles
[2087.56 → 2092.52] question for hold on I've got it uh-oh uh never mind you Luke you get nothing
[2092.52 → 2098.84] yeah okay this is crazy okay here we go here we go so cbc.ca
[2100.44 → 2106.44] Clark's political history Clark has been taking French lessons for several months according to a
[2106.44 → 2113.48] source close to her that's not a political history that's pandering nonsense the former premier has
[2113.48 → 2119.48] already made two trips to the CEGEP de conquered in Quebec and plans to return there in the coming
[2119.48 → 2123.80] months to improve her French skills okay that's just the same thing that you just said okay here
[2123.80 → 2129.32] we go she has launched a ticktock account in the last month what okay are you going to like
[2129.32 → 2133.56] are you going to get to this at some point that's good i I want my you know or is this just going to be
[2133.56 → 2138.76] puffer a word that we all learned recently okay let's continue minister to have a ticktock account
[2138.76 → 2143.72] if they don't I'm not voting for in the most recent post she encouraged British Colombians to vote
[2143.72 → 2149.80] okay where are we going to get to the history every politician on the planet has done that ah yes during
[2149.80 → 2155.48] her six years as premier she built a reputation as an environmentally conscious fiscally prudent
[2155.48 → 2160.28] liberal wait how do you champion the mining and oil industries while being environmentally conscious
[2160.84 → 2171.64] okay sure she resigned in 2017 she resigned nothing she got booted the out it was a historical defeat
[2171.64 → 2179.32] historical sorry let's continue she resigned in 2017 when her minority government was defeated by an
[2179.32 → 2186.92] NDP confidence motion no, no no, no no, no what happened was we the people sent you packing is what
[2186.92 → 2192.60] happened sorry sorry sorry um the new democrats then took over the province with the support of
[2192.60 → 2198.12] the green party her departure from politics left the bc liberal party in disarray no, no no, no no, no no, no no
[2198.12 → 2206.04] again the party her leadership left the party in disarray unable to win an election that's what
[2206.04 → 2213.08] actually happened to the point where it is died yes like it is it's its gone in April 2023 it
[2213.08 → 2219.56] officially rebranded and became bc united until it dissolved all together on the eve of the most recent
[2219.56 → 2227.16] election campaign like they weren't a part of this election oh man uh okay anyway during the conservative
[2227.16 → 2234.84] leadership regime okay she's a regular federal politics commentator on several English language
[2235.72 → 2240.76] television and radio networks including CTV CBC and global she also works as a guest speaker across
[2240.76 → 2248.84] Canada that right there is all you need to know about how someone's career ended in politics you went from
[2248.84 → 2256.12] leading one of the know major regions of a country to being a guest speaker on like
[2257.16 → 2267.96] ancient legacy media nonsense she has a ticktock good yeah which she just launched please anyway so um yeah
[2270.52 → 2275.24] cool rich message by the way I'm going to take these off they were kind of for my look with the
[2275.24 → 2281.96] tech bro vest but their prescription and my eyes are tired now yeah yeah yeah all right hit me Dan um
[2282.76 → 2289.80] I've got a new baby and cargo pockets have come in clutch excited to try the pants at what age did you
[2289.80 → 2295.16] let your kids start using screens and also thoughts on all the smart baby devices out there
[2295.72 → 2301.88] uh I let them start pretty young because I like to sleep in um we were a lot more controlling about
[2301.88 → 2307.64] what kind of content they watched in the early days now we've relaxed things a little bit so they
[2307.64 → 2312.44] they allocate screen time they're older now though yes but I just mean from the first to the
[2312.44 → 2319.32] third we just like fine yeah we just were like we can't yeah um but we allocate screen time based
[2319.32 → 2325.72] on time they spend doing other things so if they practice piano for uh 20 minutes then they can earn
[2325.72 → 2331.80] 20 minutes of screen time question for you yes do you ever worry about having things like screen time
[2331.80 → 2339.48] be a reward vector creating an un kind of unnatural sort of um desire for it and almost
[2339.48 → 2345.32] making it more addictive when they no longer have the parental rules, and they move out then you know
[2345.32 → 2351.48] do you ever worry about so that's Ivan's Ivan worries about that more than I do because she was a TV
[2351.48 → 2357.08] on all the time household the TV was like the fireplace in their household it was just always on it was the
[2357.08 → 2363.16] it was the light and sound that you know was just in the living room that people kind of gathered
[2363.16 → 2369.40] around, and she had and has no problem like sitting and doing homework in front of the TV while it while
[2369.40 → 2376.20] a show is on um and meanwhile my family was the polar opposite screens could not even be turned on
[2376.20 → 2383.88] until after dinner time and even then the time allocation to them was tightly controlled and in both
[2383.88 → 2389.40] cases households that have gone her way and households that have gone my way I've seen kids
[2389.40 → 2397.00] come out of those same households both ways yeah so I don't know what it is it might just kind of be
[2397.00 → 2402.12] what it is some people have a very addictive personality some people don't um I think generally
[2402.12 → 2411.16] philosophically um I am in favour of building good habits yeah and uh building the habit of doing
[2411.16 → 2416.04] something productive with your time rather than you know vegetating at every possible opportunity
[2416.04 → 2418.68] I feel like it makes sense I was just wondering like yeah like had it been thought about but
[2418.68 → 2424.52] something that Ivan and I have talked about and actually have done I think a couple of times is having
[2424.52 → 2432.60] um like structure holidays so you just you have okay we're we're off this week and uh you know it's
[2432.60 → 2437.40] it's we're on vacation, and you can have as much screen time as you want you could stare at your
[2437.40 → 2443.40] computer your phone your laptop whatever the TV we don't care um get it out of your system for a
[2443.40 → 2448.84] bit, and then you know when we're back to school next week it's its back so I don't know there's
[2451.40 → 2457.40] all right already I was a screen on kid and now I'm chronically online yeah there you go yeah I do
[2457.40 → 2462.68] but I mean he made a career out of it he's got a hundred thousand subscribers on his channel oh really
[2462.68 → 2467.56] yeah you didn't know that no yeah yeah already has a channel that's pretty sick um what was I gonna
[2467.56 → 2473.80] say I think the uh incredibly hyper addictive nature of things like ticktock is a little bit
[2473.80 → 2479.88] different of an arena than oh they're not on ticktock on okay Instagram YouTube shorts Facebook
[2480.52 → 2488.68] YouTube shorts um the one watch it watched too much YouTube for a bit not shorts uh he was mostly into
[2488.68 → 2494.52] like minecraft lets plays and stuff like that yeah um, but we've we've talked to him about that
[2494.52 → 2503.32] recently we've kind of cut down on that um so those some of those like hyper addictive like doom scroll
[2503.32 → 2509.08] ones we basically are like no yeah but yeah at some point they're going to have to figure it out you're
[2509.08 → 2517.64] right it's weird it's its that's when talking about kids right now there's like I mean there's all
[2517.64 → 2523.64] those conversations around coco melon and how just like brain destroying coco melon is coco melon
[2523.64 → 2527.56] bad I don't even know coco melon really as far as my understanding goes coco melon is specifically
[2527.56 → 2536.84] designed to just crank screen time oh, and it's like actually very brain potty for kids oh interesting i
[2536.84 → 2542.60] don't know much about it my kids I think missed the coco melon window I don't want to say too much stuff
[2542.60 → 2547.16] because I'm not I don't have a kids I'm not super well-read up on this but yeah people are saying bluey is
[2547.16 → 2551.40] good as far as my understanding goes bluey is pretty good there's that teacher that former
[2551.40 → 2555.64] teacher yeah yeah yeah she's supposed to be perfect miss Rachel or whatever she's supposed to be
[2555.64 → 2563.48] perfect coco melon apparently there's like measured decreases in like development from oh yeah
[2564.20 → 2569.48] okay it's terrible yeah but again I don't don't take my word on that I'm not super well-read
[2569.48 → 2575.32] up on this i just I've dude I came across an interesting topic I came across another like family vlog
[2575.32 → 2581.72] channel recently that's like exploding they're doing like 300 400 million views a month or something
[2581.72 → 2589.00] like that, and it's pretty much all shorts of these two little girls like acting out skits like you know
[2589.72 → 2594.76] uh there's one where she rides a scooter in the house and like pretends to fall over, and it's like
[2594.76 → 2598.84] don't ride scooters in the house, and it's supposed to be like a good lesson or whatever but I'm just I'm
[2598.84 → 2604.44] just looking at it going like okay how much are these kids getting paid like family vlogging is actually a
[2604.44 → 2610.60] terrible terrible terrible thing it needs to go away like immediately like legislatively yeah yeah
[2612.12 → 2615.72] yeah I just make my kids only watch LTT

[2697.96 → 2703.88] I think we've ever taken and i i understand how you could look at the premise
[2703.88 → 2707.48] and think oh they shopped at their own store they're just going to make sure it goes well
[2708.28 → 2715.64] but as you're about to see we intentionally built this in a way that forced us to be held
[2715.64 → 2719.64] accountable regardless of the outcome and so uh yeah here it comes
[2722.76 → 2727.64] we can't hear it because we have to do that series and have all their worst problems brought to light
[2727.64 → 2736.92] but after today I won't have to imagine it and neither will nick because I paid five of you
[2736.92 → 2742.52] to secret shop our store and I'm sitting with the creator warehouse head of product nick light to
[2743.48 → 2748.92] enjoy the results firsthand nick looks genuinely uncomfortable
[2748.92 → 2757.64] he didn't know really all he knew was that he was going to help co-host a video
[2758.76 → 2765.56] so he sat down he found out when I said that holy crap you know how much I value genuine
[2765.56 → 2770.52] reactions on camera yeah you know the lengths that I will go to the number of times that people are like
[2771.40 → 2777.80] fake fake fake you're just actually idiots like I care so much
[2778.36 → 2783.16] about capturing real reactions we're in our mid-30s I've known nick since we were in grade eight
[2783.96 → 2793.56] he was very uncomfortable oh yeah oh man enjoy because I got a sneak peek
[2793.56 → 2800.20] and it's not all sunshine and rainbows unlike this segue to our sponsor this is a star
[2801.24 → 2806.52] did it not go I'm so incredibly curious now I'm almost like annoyed that we have to keep doing land show
[2806.52 → 2812.84] okay I don't want to go watch it well there is one way to do so you will just have to subscribe to
[2812.84 → 2819.24] float plane dude don't be upset this is promoting float plane you should be yeah i just I want to go
[2819.24 → 2824.20] watch it right now i know leg.GG slash float plane while you're there you can pick up an
[2824.20 → 2830.92] FP exclusive dinosaur shirt uh-huh designed by the one and only by the way yeah it's a little bit
[2830.92 → 2835.72] confusing because when you go through our t-shirt section there you go all the shirts are depicted
[2835.72 → 2840.12] with their front and then this one is depicted with the back, so the float plane logo is on the
[2840.12 → 2844.92] front yes the dinosaur plane thing is designed by the one and only Sarah but uh all right which I think
[2844.92 → 2849.00] was the right choice it's just confusing there are a couple of other quick things for us to announce
[2849.00 → 2853.72] uh we have a correction in our video on buying every tech ad we saw for a month we demonstrated
[2853.72 → 2861.08] one product the birdie personal co2 alarm incorrectly specifically the wall mount was not installed and
[2861.08 → 2866.28] it doesn't work unless it's attached to the wall mount so we removed that section from the original
[2866.28 → 2870.36] video to avoid misrepresenting the product we have reconducted our original test with the wall mount
[2870.36 → 2879.88] attached and released a YouTube short showing it activating it's still um a product that you
[2879.88 → 2885.56] probably shouldn't buy because it's 200 for a co2 detector it doesn't have any kind of
[2885.56 → 2893.24] like screen on it or logging or anything um it doesn't detect any other potentially harmful
[2894.20 → 2900.12] uh gases uh there's like way better value options that are way more effective and
[2900.12 → 2908.44] and do yeah work way better but anyway um yeah it is definitely does what it says it does
[2909.08 → 2917.32] so yeah good for them uh okay oh also it's folding month begins November 1st and the leg
[2917.32 → 2921.48] community is once again participating if you'd like to sign up there's a post with information on the
[2921.48 → 2926.52] forum which Dan is gonna post for you guys and all the various chats as a company we're also contributing
[2926.52 → 2933.48] 20 100 LTT store gift cards for prizes signups close next Monday, so please join the team finally
[2934.12 → 2941.80] let's talk about AI crypto and biohacking yeah does it look like we want to talk about those
[2941.80 → 2947.80] things it should because we're wearing the new tech bro vest from LTT store something Dogecoin
[2947.80 → 2953.48] it's insulated with the same 3d down that you would find on our old 3d down jacket meaning that
[2953.48 → 2959.48] it is surprisingly warm for how light the vest actually is it's also made of a water-resistant
[2959.48 → 2965.16] material and has a soft tricot knit back which is quite comfy, and it's designed to be able to be worn
[2965.16 → 2971.08] in the office over a button-up or polo like many tech bros do so you can dress it down casually you can
[2971.08 → 2977.48] lay it on top of a t-shirt hoodie or sweater it's totally up to you, it is kind of outer wear though because of
[2977.80 → 2983.08] the material it's made of the same stuff at 4 30 a.m made of the same stuff as our 3d down jacket
[2983.08 → 2988.44] thank you for that um and like most of our outerwear it's loaded with PKK zippered pockets so you can
[2988.44 → 2996.04] always have your essentials on hand task-based AI is the future available now at leg.GG slash tech bro
[2996.04 → 3001.24] so here's Nate actually wears one of these vests every day, so this was like the most appropriate
[3001.24 → 3006.76] possible model for us to have here it looks quite natural it's got his air pods
[3009.88 → 3016.76] oh just okay I'm sorry knowing Nate this picture is way funnier than if you don't known ate uh he's
[3016.76 → 3022.60] working on an electronics engineering project for us that um is very, very exciting and he 100 wears a
[3022.60 → 3030.44] vest and uh 100 would look exactly like that um anyway oh my god they definitely picked they
[3030.44 → 3035.96] definitely picked the best people to model this there's Sean from the infrateam dude right though
[3035.96 → 3041.80] yeah it's the tech bro vest uh the reason it's not cheap is that it's like really nice 3d down it's
[3041.80 → 3047.40] it's basically our 3d down jacket without a sleeve without the sleeves yeah so there you go nothing says
[3047.40 → 3054.44] disruptive innovation like the tech bro vest oh my god okay the team working on the copy has
[3054.44 → 3064.04] actually gotten really, really funny over the last little bit I love it nice got the off-site laptop
[3064.04 → 3071.48] bag that's what a guy whose company was just reviewed looks like yeah all right cool all right what else
[3071.48 → 3080.60] we what else we got going on Dan what are we doing let's do a topic shall we NVIDIA to ship one
[3081.32 → 3088.28] billion risk 5 cores this year NVIDIA gave a keynote speech at the risk 5 summit with the speaker
[3088.28 → 3094.92] estimating that the company expects to ship about a billion risk 5 cores across its GPUs CPUs SOCS and
[3094.92 → 3100.44] other products slides of the talk were shared on Twitter by nick brown senior research fellow at university
[3100.44 → 3105.80] of Edinburgh's EPCC super computing centre the company has been switching from its proprietary
[3105.80 → 3112.04] microcontrollers to ones that are built on the open source ISA since at least 2015 and have now
[3112.04 → 3118.76] revealed that they have fully phased out their former falcon microcontroller in favour of custom risk 5
[3118.76 → 3126.44] cores all told there are 10 to 40 of the cores on every NVIDIA chip depending on the chip's complexity
[3126.44 → 3133.48] the company has developed at least three risk 5 microcontroller cores and more than 20 custom risk 5
[3133.48 → 3139.80] extensions NVIDIA GPUs have apparently had risk 5 GPU system processors since Turing really I didn't know
[3139.80 → 3145.64] that this is super cool this is super because NVIDIA has talked a lot about all of the know the
[3145.64 → 3150.52] monitoring that they do and the load balancing and all the cool stuff that they're doing on their
[3150.52 → 3157.40] GPU dies, but they haven't said that they're using risk 5 at least not way back then I didn't know i
[3157.40 → 3168.92] didn't know risk 5 somebody knew risk 5 is freaking everywhere yeah it's really exciting and good
[3168.92 → 3175.48] especially if you look at the uh at the way that the relationship between arm and at least one of their
[3175.48 → 3183.80] partners is uh going right now dude it is not a good time for arm to show any kind of any kind
[3183.80 → 3190.84] of weakness it's a good time for arm to be super, super magnanimous and easy to work with because
[3191.64 → 3201.24] risk 5 has no licensing fees no licensing fees I'm excited I am really excited about a risk 5 future I've
[3201.24 → 3207.32] still I've still been dairying my uh my snapdragon windows laptop ever since the challenge ended i just
[3208.36 → 3213.00] I don't know but they took my the AMD framework that I built on short circuit uh because they needed
[3213.00 → 3217.80] it for something, and then they like apparently needed it for something for a while so I've just
[3217.80 → 3224.28] been using my snapdragon and I have the occasional issue with it but overall I'm I'm blown away at how
[3224.28 → 3233.00] usable it is and seeing translation layers work to run programs and seeing the kinds of
[3233.00 → 3238.44] investments that major companies like NVIDIA are making into risk 5 and making it better making it
[3238.44 → 3248.20] viable I'm pretty hopeful that's good it's a good sign yeah having a big company behind a project like
[3248.20 → 3254.68] that um can sometimes be scary but often gives it long-term legs that just being open
[3254.68 → 3260.28] source doesn't even though I'm saying that about a project that has existed for a very long you like
[3260.28 → 3265.40] need industry consortiums to kind of get together and say okay, okay this is open source and like it's
[3265.40 → 3271.24] super cool but how are we gonna how are we going to push it forward yeah you need cooperation yeah that's good
[3271.24 → 3280.04] good Squarespace going private sure why don't you talk about that permira something a private
[3280.04 → 3284.92] equity firm has purchased all available common stock for Squarespace meaning that Squarespace is
[3284.92 → 3290.68] no longer a publicly traded company Squarespace went public three years ago in 2021 and yo-yoed a fair
[3290.68 → 3295.48] amount after that it reached a market cap of eight billion dollars two billion less than the company's
[3295.48 → 3302.44] peak private valuation in 2022 its market cap fell off a cliff hitting two billion dollars which
[3302.44 → 3308.28] while still a lot of money is significantly less than 10 uh before gradually returning to five
[3308.28 → 3314.36] billion dollars professor which again is quite a swing three billion dollars is kind of a lot uh and
[3314.36 → 3321.00] then uh premiere's purchase is worth a combined total of 7.2 billion dollars likely indicating a degree of
[3321.00 → 3326.84] confidence that this rebound wasn't accidental uh it's unclear what if anything will change for
[3326.84 → 3333.08] Squarespace clients and my dyslexia read that as SpongeBob at first um our discussion question is
[3333.08 → 3338.52] I have no idea what Linus was going for when he sent this story does this affect our company somehow
[3339.80 → 3346.68] well Squarespace has been one of our longest running partners are they no not quite close to the
[3346.68 → 3355.64] the longest but not the longest yeah they go way back with LTT and I guess all I'm trying to say is
[3358.20 → 3366.28] premiere please don't screw it up okay you've also got a lot on your hands now because of the whole domains
[3366.28 → 3372.68] thing yeah there's a lot of people that scrambled to leave when domains went from Google domains to
[3372.68 → 3377.40] Squarespace and then now there's a lot of people scrambling to leave that domains are going from
[3377.40 → 3382.36] Squarespace to Squarespace still but public to private um people are looking for alternatives it's
[3382.36 → 3390.36] a thing yeah so um you know just don't bung it up please yeah we like working with Squarespace we like
[3390.36 → 3397.40] using the product let a good thing be a good thing why don't you be why don't you be the smart private
[3397.40 → 3406.76] equity firm uh cat OS or cat talk whoa I think I just realized that cat OS has another t in it, I don't
[3406.76 → 3413.40] think I ever registered that before but okay um a lot of people can't go to Cloudflare because Cloudflare
[3413.40 → 3420.28] doesn't actually support that many domains like Cloudflare doesn't support.ca oh okay yeah that's
[3420.28 → 3424.36] a problem for so we Canadians yeah so we can't just have Cloudflare right
[3424.36 → 3430.68] so we have to use something else, and previously we did use Google domains right and now obviously
[3430.68 → 3436.12] we don't, and we don't use Squarespace domains either oh we used like go daddy way back in the day
[3436.12 → 3437.48] well you did yeah I know
[3440.04 → 3441.88] we don't use it at all any more yeah no I know
[3444.12 → 3448.36] oh man I don't remember the name off the top of my head what's the do you know the name
[3448.36 → 3453.16] Dan of the new thing we use for dot c domains I don't remember whatever Danica Patrick said it was
[3453.16 → 3456.84] good if only she was good at racing
[3461.00 → 3468.52] she was pretty good oh you know what speaking of lady race drivers you know who I would love to see
[3469.16 → 3473.40] uh tackle that unless she's already done it and I missed it I'd love to see Michelle carry do it
[3473.40 → 3480.76] just no I don't know I don't believe you it started with if it was like grange or something
[3480.76 → 3481.80] it's going to bother me now
[3485.40 → 3490.68] what are you talking about what are you guys even trying to figure out right now the domain uh thing
[3490.68 → 3494.76] oh yeah the domain thing what are you guys even talking about the registrar we use a different
[3494.76 → 3498.84] register now well yeah, but we're not going to like tell people what we use anyway are we I mean we tell
[3498.84 → 3502.52] people that we use Cloudflare for like almost everything which is way bigger honeypot than this would be
[3503.16 → 3509.24] that's not what a honeypot is okay got him it could be okay why don't we just not I don't think
[3509.24 → 3514.60] I can not if you want, but it's also like pretty easy to figure out yeah that's fine I just mean why
[3514.60 → 3524.12] are we drawing attention to this fair enough you know better it's its oh my god Luke is now the security
[3524.12 → 3532.60] risk nice sure oh dude the hat has been transferred I put the vest on i immediately
[3532.60 → 3542.28] became a security risk come to get out of this stock short Ltd oh uh okay
[3542.28 → 3546.52] oh no
[3549.24 → 3553.24] what oh, thanks I don't have something now I don't have to look it up I appreciate that
[3553.24 → 3553.88] nothing
[3557.32 → 3561.96] you can't have inside jokes on a podcast you guys AJ just said it

[3582.12 → 3587.96] don't talk about it at all we just don't bring it up maybe we need jump cloud to help with our
[3587.96 → 3589.96] idea we don't know what we're doing
[3592.20 → 3595.32] yes you can who has a domain I know it just oh my god
[3596.04 → 3600.28] logos isn't wrong he's not wrong it's just it's just very funny don't we have to use multiple because

[3604.60 → 3607.88] no I'm no I'm just going to make it worse you know you could probably you could probably
[3607.88 → 3612.20] figure out what data centre we're hosted in pretty easily i I mean we've said that a bunch
[3612.20 → 3616.68] of times to no you can't yeah, but we go out of our way not to talk about it that much that is true
[3616.68 → 3623.96] and I don't say all of them now you're basically just asking them to figure it out yeah yeah see
[3623.96 → 3627.40] yeah you like this yeah now he doesn't like the other side of this coin
[3631.64 → 3634.60] oh apparently AJ stream was delayed he wasn't there yet

[3931.56 → 3937.80] wow, wow chad move here we also have a bunch of people at the office that play
[3938.60 → 3941.64] I'm sure we could like to pull people out of the wood yeah but if I'm gonna if I'm going to like pull
[3941.64 → 3945.96] people to game at night we're going to like left for dead yeah exactly or play tape to tape yeah we'll
[3945.96 → 3950.20] play something that tape is cocky much it's not that it's just like something that Linus can win
[3950.20 → 3953.88] it is actually really like that hard I'm not trying to like play people
[3956.04 → 3961.88] Joe and i the game's not actually hard I'm not trying to flame people really do go on
[3962.76 → 3966.92] Joe and I used to do the hardest difficulty as a duo instead of a four stack, and it was fine
[3967.72 → 3972.68] but I'm not trying to flame anybody this guy's a gamer wow the game's super easy if you're
[3972.68 → 3978.20] bad actual skill issue if only he was as good at super checks as he is at hell divers too
[3979.32 → 3981.88] literally stopped playing because he was tired of getting his
[3981.88 → 3983.64] monkey spanked that's not true
[3985.88 → 3987.08] my monkey spank
[3991.40 → 3997.16] oh my goodness who's yeah why are we playing you okay so I have to do bird meds tonight yeah
[3997.16 → 4003.64] but then afterwards you invited me to play pool yeah let's play pool since we are it the vests what
[4003.64 → 4010.84] no I got a pool table why yeah why are you going to move super checks there I was thinking that yeah
[4010.84 → 4016.28] yeah, yeah just move it to smash jams nobody uses it here yeah yeah yeah so we'll have super checks i
[4016.28 → 4023.00] was thinking I want to get a pinball machine dude what a flipping rabbit hole pinball machines they can
[4023.00 → 4029.00] they can cost as much as a new car you get a stern one if it's like the like a good one it's like the
[4029.00 → 4035.40] Pirates of the Caribbean you know special edition or whatever, or they can be like flipping cheap they
[4035.40 → 4040.44] can be like just a couple grand even though they're like supposedly fully functional there are all kinds of
[4040.44 → 4044.92] modifications people will do on them, they'll put like you know more transparent glass on them and
[4044.92 → 4051.40] they'll, they'll do all kinds of like mods and stuff and like expand the sound effects and make it play
[4051.40 → 4057.08] different music there's like the depth of pinball machines I'm looking at it going like
[4057.80 → 4062.92] I would need a consultant before I would be able to confidently buy a pinball machine
[4062.92 → 4067.16] buy a stern one wouldn't yeah but I don't want it to depreciate three grand the second I bring it
[4067.16 → 4072.68] home like I would, I'd want to like to pick a like a good one or something like I don't know I used stern one
[4072.68 → 4075.96] it's freaking wild dude it's wild
[4078.84 → 4084.12] but ice weasel says Linus jumping into other hobbies then complaining about how people
[4084.12 → 4087.96] who love their hobbies pay more for stuff they want is hilarious that's not what I'm even talking about
[4089.24 → 4095.16] not even remotely what I'm talking about I'm talking about how it's a rabbit hole what a crazy take and
[4095.16 → 4100.20] it's something that I don't I don't understand well I don't know what the value of the different
[4100.20 → 4106.60] things is, and it seems like I couldn't possibly hope to why is Pirates of the Caribbean worth more
[4106.60 → 4116.04] than Captain America I don't know to there's I have no idea there's a 16 000 Adam's family pinball
[4116.04 → 4121.08] machine yeah dude I didn't even I didn't even look at brand new like I was just looking at this is
[4121.08 → 4126.68] refurbished this is 1992 refurbished the pinball company okay I wasn't even looking at retailers
[4126.68 → 4131.56] so there's uh I want to say pinheads or something like that there's like a community that has a buy
[4131.56 → 4136.52] sell trade and then I was looking at Facebook marketplace as well and just the range like
[4136.52 → 4140.52] they go from two grand to twenty thousand dollars and these are secondhand machines so they're all
[4140.52 → 4145.96] secondhand and like everyone will list like how many hours it has on it or whatever but I don't know
[4145.96 → 4150.92] if there's a way to fake that like we found out during the mighty car mods video that um
[4150.92 → 4157.08] proof's um proof's car had been odometer swapped oh really yeah so it had like markings from an
[4157.08 → 4162.68] auto wrecker on it once they pulled it out that were like low kilometres it didn't come from that car
[4162.68 → 4167.56] that sure as heck wasn't written on at the factory so like I don't know can your odometer swap a pin
[4167.56 → 4176.52] bulb I don't know freaking no one makes it anymore they're all vintage no that's not true that's totally
[4176.52 → 4182.04] not true stern I've said it like a bunch of times yeahs you can definitely still buy brand-new machines
[4182.04 → 4186.20] but I'm not really like a brand-new machine kind of guy you know that yeah, yeah like I bought a used
[4186.20 → 4191.64] super checks machine because I know that I can turn around and like and that i kind of i at least like
[4191.64 → 4197.64] played the game and there's only like a couple of variants so I was able to I read like this 400 page
[4197.64 → 4204.60] uh super checks owners thread on uh like some pinball forum of some kind some arcade game
[4204.60 → 4211.96] forum so like I'm I'm pretty versed in that, but there's like four variants of the game pinball
[4213.16 → 4219.48] it's endless, and they've been around since like the 80s or whatever so they can be like I'm you know
[4219.48 → 4223.80] there's like an I'm sure there's like a valley of vintage ness you know like if they're like old they're
[4223.80 → 4227.56] just old but if they're ancient they're vintage especially if they're still working i I'm just
[4227.56 → 4234.20] saying I don't understand it um but i yeah i just I want one for the lounge basically for the uh for
[4234.20 → 4243.40] the members lounge at the badminton club yeah okay let's see hey Walpole I was eyeing those cargo
[4243.40 → 4249.72] pants but as an extra short boy 24 unseam I had to hold off oh pinball's apparently much older than
[4249.72 → 4255.72] the 80s okay well there you go shows you what I know ancient cool couple questions are they
[4255.72 → 4264.44] hummable are there plans for a short version how are the sales uh unfortunately they are not easily
[4264.44 → 4270.84] hummable and right now we don't have plans for a shorter unseam sales have been pretty solid though
[4270.84 → 4278.92] I think this is our first really successful pant oh yeah I think you meant like uh shorts
[4278.92 → 4288.12] shorts no, no no, no no yeah no, no no smaller unseam um
[4295.48 → 4304.12] oh sorry yep good cool someone didn't save a file to the server, and it screwed things up like it
[4304.12 → 4310.68] always does never save a file to your local machine didn't you fix that uh no I fixed a
[4310.68 → 4316.52] different issue oh I fixed an issue where a file was deleted off of the server over a week ago and we
[4316.52 → 4326.76] had to recover it from a cloud oh we got it good job nice bad nice scary good job guys may I ask what the
[4326.76 → 4333.24] file was um it was an it was a flow plane exclusive
[4336.12 → 4342.44] what was it uh denied version and was it like the whole folder I think it was a folder with a whole
[4342.44 → 4348.36] bunch of the denied stuff I have no idea I'm not super up on all the different types of working
[4348.36 → 4353.72] copies that we have got it yeah okay great because we only have three days of on-site replication
[4353.72 → 4362.92] so it gets really messed up got it uh okay so we did that one last one I got for you hey DLL dot when
[4363.88 → 4369.08] could we get a feature to buy items not in stock there is always an item out of stock when I want
[4369.08 → 4375.08] to order rather wait a long time than to pay postage twice thanks for everything no
[4377.24 → 4382.28] sorry inventory management is really hard and I could go on a really really really long thing about
[4382.28 → 4387.96] why that would make it way harder um but I think it's pretty boring for everyone else the short
[4387.96 → 4395.40] answer is no it's really hard um and the odds that some other item would accidentally go out of stock
[4396.04 → 4402.92] while we got the other item in stock uh would be really high, and it would mean that we'd have all these
[4402.92 → 4411.96] orders like queued that we would either take your money for and then um but wait when did we deliver it
[4411.96 → 4417.48] did the order get placed now or is it when we've fulfilled it and then the return window tracking
[4417.48 → 4421.88] and then the accounting complication of when the order was actually placed is that when the money came
[4421.88 → 4425.72] or is that when we ordered the thing, and we sent it out there's it actually does add a lot of
[4425.72 → 4430.28] complication, and we're just not going to do that what we are going to do is we're going to manage our
[4430.28 → 4435.80] inventory better so that the site isn't like half out of stock it goes that's that's what we're focused on
[4435.80 → 4439.80] how often do you how often do you have reviews that say they're going to purchase five to ten more of the
[4439.80 → 4445.40] thing that they I don't know but what is that for oh only the best thing in the world oh Geez yes, yes
[4445.40 → 4450.76] yes we're going to make five to ten is not enough I want to buy five to ten more can you sell them in
[4450.76 → 4457.56] like 20 packs they don't exist can I have bulk packs I would buy them in bulk especially if
[4457.56 → 4463.64] they're not going to be uh have any printing on them wow these are getting perfect reviews all
[4463.64 → 4467.64] right well I'm just I'm just glad you guys like them all right the tall shirts yeah as far as my
[4467.64 → 4472.52] understanding goes they are currently perfect reviews thank you don't tempt them we love
[4472.52 → 4478.04] you that's true I still remember when I had that video that had zero dislikes for like years and then
[4478.04 → 4483.88] I mentioned on wan show it just got bombed yeah it's like you butts that's what happens and these are the
[4483.88 → 4492.04] guys that like us yeah questionable yeah there 's's people that hate watch this is actually
[4492.04 → 4499.56] something I have encountered like i I've encountered posts that are like this long about how awful I am
[4499.56 → 4504.92] and how you're barely more tolerable than me, and it'll be like as well they'll be referring to something
[4504.92 → 4511.24] that we talk about like three and a half hours into like some marathon ass wan show and with all the
[4511.24 → 4517.88] context of like everything we said before it and I'm sitting here going you know you can change the
[4517.88 → 4526.68] channel yeah it's an option we do have the technology oh man all right what are
[4526.68 → 4531.40] we even supposed to be doing Dan I got a few more topics we only got about dude this week has five
[4531.40 → 4538.28] minutes left this week has been insane okay I didn't even realize I didn't even realize when I sat down
[4538.28 → 4543.32] to do wan show today how insane this week had been I was sitting here going like oh man I'm exhausted
[4543.32 → 4547.64] this week like I'm kind of glad it's going to be a bit of a shorter show because i I just like I don't
[4547.64 → 4552.04] have the energy for it and I was like man what did we get up to this week like yeah there's the mighty car
[4552.04 → 4559.32] mods shoot we had uh we had like an I don't know a bunch of other shoots I reviewed a lot of scripts
[4559.32 → 4567.40] and videos and like dude I went to equinix yeah
[4567.40 → 4577.32] what's that so they build themselves as the biggest tech company nobody ever heard of which
[4577.32 → 4581.80] you've heard that line you've heard that line before right yeah they may actually be right
[4582.68 → 4584.20] they might actually be the ones
[4586.36 → 4589.32] yeah I know of equinox not Equinix how do you even spell it
[4589.32 → 4600.12] uh here uh e q u i n i x and i x okay yeah
[4603.00 → 4607.80] data centre company and enterprise network technologies no i this you would think this
[4607.80 → 4611.96] would be something that I've heard of you would think so but these guys operate at a completely
[4611.96 → 4619.16] different level they don't give two flying leading companies choose google cloud azure AWS
[4619.16 → 4626.20] Netflix zoom okay they don't give two flying boogers a boat float plane okay we we are just a
[4626.20 → 4634.12] stain on the back of their heel because they walked through the I don't know bogie park next to their
[4634.12 → 4639.56] penthouse they live in like we don't matter to these guys um wow I mean I shouldn't say that
[4639.56 → 4649.08] because they did sponsor the video and uh so it's so we did a tour dude um this place was
[4649.08 → 4656.12] flipping wild um and the reason they actually showed up on my radar was because I found
[4656.12 → 4662.60] out that they were planning to use the deep lake cooling system in Lake Ontario to cool a data centre
[4662.60 → 4667.88] sick and I was like that's neat I don't know who these guys are but let's go let's get in touch look
[4667.88 → 4678.52] at the partner list uh yeah okay, okay okay absolutely is there a large technology company in the Fortune 500
[4678.52 → 4687.00] well absolutely all of them chatted out partner list and what was cool about it was they went
[4687.00 → 4696.52] full open kimono like sick they literally showed me a room that if I walked any
[4696.52 → 4703.32] further into it and was caught on the motion sensors and cameras there would be there would have to be a
[4703.32 → 4711.08] report to the sec that someone was in the room, but you're allowed to like look in I was allowed to look
[4711.08 → 4717.24] into the room we got a shot we got a shot of the room that's pretty cool okay you know how when we
[4717.24 → 4722.12] do tours of factories and facilities and stuff there's always like no, no filming signs everywhere
[4723.16 → 4728.84] right yeah they didn't have a single one you know why because nobody would be in there if they had a
[4728.84 → 4739.96] camera that's one way to do it they built this building custom okay they built it so the foundation
[4739.96 → 4744.12] foundation was feet above ground level you know why
[4746.84 → 4750.92] because the city wouldn't let them put bollards and truck stoppers around it because they're
[4750.92 → 4756.76] unattractive so they made it built it on a platform so if you ram the building you will literally hit
[4756.76 → 4768.44] the foundation okay that's that is a solution custom-building that's the way they did it these guys are
[4768.44 → 4774.84] absolutely insane okay so on the roof on the roof okay so you know the speed of light right it's as
[4774.84 → 4780.20] fast as stuff can go but the speed of light's not fixed okay Logitech demoed this years ago when they
[4780.20 → 4787.32] showed their light speed wireless dongle actually outperforming a cable because the speed of light
[4787.32 → 4793.72] through an optical fibre or any medium through any medium is variable so through an optical fibre
[4793.72 → 4798.76] we approximate that the speed of light is about two-thirds of the speed of light in a vacuum
[4798.76 → 4806.76] but in air it's very close to the speed of light in a vacuum it's like 0.997 or something I can't
[4806.76 → 4813.88] remember what it is the point is it's its a lot more than two-thirds so get this on the roof
[4813.88 → 4821.56] they have microwave dishes that are pointed at the TSX
[4823.40 → 4829.24] and toward New York Toronto stock exchange where the other where the other oh yeah sorry where
[4829.24 → 4836.60] there are other exchanges so that they have the lowest possible latency link because light through
[4836.60 → 4846.84] a fibre optic cable is not fast enough that's pretty wild dude I saw a cage there
[4848.60 → 4855.88] that not only had all four sides closed not only had visibility blockers installed in the cage
[4856.60 → 4863.64] not only had the fifth ceiling chain link installed on the top okay because some companies will
[4863.64 → 4868.36] have regulations for particular data or particular operations that you have to have six sides
[4868.92 → 4875.88] essentially on the cage that can contain not only did it have all of that it had touch sensors in the
[4875.88 → 4884.36] chain link oh if you so much as lean the chain if you so much as lean on their cage the head of security
[4885.24 → 4888.76] for Equinix gets a call and that will not be a good call no
[4888.76 → 4898.92] that's so sick dude this place was wild, and they showed us everything absolutely everything nothing
[4898.92 → 4904.12] that they were not legally allowed to show us they showed us everything Equinix nothing from their
[4904.12 → 4909.24] customers that they weren't allowed to show us but like they had an empty cage so I was able
[4909.24 → 4915.56] to go in and like show how the cold aisle and hot aisle separation works and like i I held the temperature
[4915.56 → 4920.04] sensor, and you could see it like open up the thing and like don't hold air on me so we were able to do
[4920.04 → 4927.24] really cool demos because they really did let us in um it's going to be probably one of the coolest
[4927.24 → 4936.92] videos we have ever done do not miss it this is like no actually for real a data centre like of the
[4936.92 → 4945.32] highest of the highest tier like your bank and your ISP and the cloud services that you use your bank has
[4945.32 → 4950.36] that this is where they are that old Windows 98 okay system sitting in the corner so the room the
[4950.36 → 4956.52] room that you have to file a sec report if anyone's restored if anyone so much as goes into it and
[4956.52 → 4963.56] approaches the rack any guesses as to what's in there the sec is involved so you know it has to do with
[4963.56 → 4970.04] exchanges and trading I'll tell you that much I'm not even going to know like the names of
[4970.04 → 4975.08] different things but I'm assuming it's the trading computers nope no computers no computers
[4975.08 → 4978.84] it's no computers it's just because they would all have their own cages they would have
[4978.84 → 4982.52] their own leased space and everything they would yeah they'd be caged off wait I thought you this was
[4982.52 → 4987.32] did I miss something I thought this was no it's a room oh okay it's a room it's just there's a room on
[4987.32 → 4991.72] the floor and there are no computers in the room no there's no they don't need computers in there
[4991.72 → 4998.04] they don't need any computers for that what I have no idea at a data centre a room with no computers that if
[4998.04 → 5006.20] anyone goes into the sec has to be told records of some kind no, no no records networking would you
[5006.20 → 5015.64] not consider that computers kind of no gear though yeah no gear what spools of fibre optic cable
[5016.20 → 5022.04] and the sec has to be oh the uh the I've heard of this it's the one that keeps all the trading
[5022.04 → 5027.48] platforms fair so you can't have shorter links everybody has to have the same length of cable
[5027.48 → 5033.72] I saw um a video so they had one in their building, and it was this giant spool, and it goes from the
[5033.72 → 5039.64] switch to like another switch, and it's just 30 kilometres of so if someone's office you can't
[5039.64 → 5045.16] have less latency yeah they would have fewer spools in their room because like nanoseconds matter in
[5045.16 → 5050.04] trading oh that's sick so they I'm so excited about this video like the furthest you could be
[5051.00 → 5057.80] and then everyone has to have that much that length of a fibre optic link oh man isn't that cool I feel
[5057.80 → 5061.88] like I've heard of this before but just completely forgot someone said tom Scott made a video on this
[5061.88 → 5065.96] I probably watched that it's probably old and I probably forgot about it since then that's wild
[5065.96 → 5072.76] yeah very cool, so these aren't like kilometre long spools here these are just uh to uh for fairness
[5072.76 → 5078.68] within this data centre floor okay so different companies that are using this data centre yeah and
[5078.68 → 5083.72] then they have to use that service they have to use like that service that Equinix offers for the like
[5083.72 → 5088.68] the fair linkage and that's something that like from a regulatory standpoint they have to subscribe to
[5088.68 → 5094.92] yeah and equinox themselves probably have a bigger one that also does the building I'm assuming uh probably
[5094.92 → 5100.12] yeah yeah um actually I don't know because it's going to depend on the setup like it's going to depend on
[5100.12 → 5105.00] what partners are in there and what yeah I'm just making an assumption yeah but yeah no uh
[5105.00 → 5111.32] yeah oh dude this place and I haven't even i I haven't given away the whole video like this place is
[5111.32 → 5117.08] flipping wild and I was uh I was joking with them, I was like yeah so when we did the intel fab tour uh
[5117.08 → 5122.28] they kind of quipped to me that the last person they could remember giving this level of access to was
[5123.00 → 5129.96] then president Barack Obama and um and I was I just i i I told the anecdote because i kind of want to
[5129.96 → 5137.96] to see their reaction, and they were kind of like I don't know I can't think of anyone we've ever done
[5137.96 → 5144.60] this with because remember they're not just showing me around a little bit like they had an entire
[5144.60 → 5150.52] entourage there with us, they had liked their head of oh man I'm going to get this wrong his title's like
[5150.52 → 5155.08] head of what's that jimmy so now you have one thing to come with Obama
[5155.08 → 5164.44] nice me Obama and Taylor Swift we like birds of a feather you know yeah um okay sorry what was I
[5164.44 → 5172.28] going to say um right so they didn't just like show us around we had oh right his title he was like the
[5172.28 → 5177.88] head of like global architecture solutions or something like that but in Canada so he was like
[5177.88 → 5186.76] like the Canadian head of it but like globally so like any Canadian based multinational
[5187.40 → 5194.04] he like deals with so essentially he's like a global architecture lead guy but like Canadian
[5194.04 → 5198.84] based or something like that for Equinix yeah for equity okay yeah so they had him there they
[5198.84 → 5207.64] had um they had a had as far as I could tell head of security like I don't know if that was for
[5207.64 → 5216.36] the country or just like at all uh, but he was like he looked like a head of security just and super smart
[5216.36 → 5221.16] he the guy just like knew everything off the top of his head like every customer like everything guy was
[5221.88 → 5226.52] chatted out it might have just been for that centre but I don't know, but he had the head of security there
[5226.52 → 5233.00] um dude these guys were these guys where these guys are crazy um so they not only like showed us
[5233.00 → 5237.16] around or whatever, but they were there to answer basically any question we had I asked how much
[5237.16 → 5242.84] how much how much uh loading per square foot each floor was designed for I wasn't expecting them
[5242.84 → 5249.40] to give me that that is like a that's a speck of their building design like did they just know it and
[5249.40 → 5255.64] they they they knew approximately offhand and then found out and like told me and I was like okay
[5256.52 → 5263.40] there are six feet of concrete between every floor the place was crazy dude you wouldn't believe the
[5263.40 → 5268.92] conduit runs it's a thing of beauty it's a thing of beauty you know you're a nerd when you i I enjoy
[5268.92 → 5272.84] that as well yeah just to be clear, but you know you're a nerd when you get excited about the conduit
[5272.84 → 5277.72] runs but they um but yeah so, and we were in there filming everything right like that they were like
[5277.72 → 5283.16] yeah I just don't think we've ever done this like oh okay cool um, and they might have at some point
[5283.16 → 5287.88] maybe you know whoever I was talking to didn't remember are you worried about uh like
[5287.88 → 5293.24] revisions to the video because they noticed something or whatever no because um a lot of
[5293.24 → 5301.40] their building is designed to be security first so because they're going to have third-party people
[5302.04 → 5309.00] visiting their own cages or whatever else yeah it's designed so that they can't see or touch or do
[5309.00 → 5315.08] anything they're not supposed to do yeah so everything that Equinix showed us was Equinix
[5315.08 → 5321.96] stuff and everybody who approved that was literally standing there in our group as we went around so it
[5321.96 → 5328.04] was one of those it was one of those situations where like it was a sponsored video but like I had
[5328.04 → 5335.32] done it anyway like 100, and they didn't even I think the only couple of things they asked for in the
[5335.32 → 5339.80] because I went through the script with them the only like they asked for a couple of things um
[5339.80 → 5346.44] i I said they operate over 250 data centres worldwide, and they were like okay we understand 250 is a kind
[5346.44 → 5351.32] of nicer rounder sounding number we understand why you did that but can you say over 260.
[5351.32 → 5355.80] and I was like okay right who cares right like I'm not gonna I'm not going to dig in my heels
[5355.80 → 5360.60] they're already doing the specifics while you're live minor details like that i just mean like
[5360.60 → 5366.60] they didn't they didn't ask me to change my voice right yeah or my thoughts which I guess is
[5366.60 → 5372.84] like fine because realistically I was just needing out the whole time anyway um and there was stuff
[5372.84 → 5379.40] that I left out that they mentioned like they had a lot of the initial briefing was about the like
[5379.40 → 5385.64] environmental impact stuff that they work on and initiatives like that and I was like i basically
[5385.64 → 5390.04] left out all of it because at the end of the day it's already going to be over a 20-minute video
[5390.04 → 5393.64] just so you know we just released two videos on processors that are really power efficient
[5395.64 → 5402.44] people cared a lot yeah yeah and so i i i get that you know when people go on Equinix's
[5402.44 → 5406.20] website you know that needs to be the first thing that they see and I understand the importance of
[5406.20 → 5412.12] that stuff yeah they do seem to legitimately put a ton of very real work into being a more sustainable
[5412.12 → 5415.96] company which is great, but it isn't why people tuned into this video it doesn't get a lot of views
[5415.96 → 5422.84] it's and I need to be focused on what people clicked this video to see you know and uh and so
[5422.84 → 5428.68] i I took a lot of that stuff out, and they were like okay you know we want we want to let you be
[5428.68 → 5434.36] the expert they suggested a bunch of like titles and thumbnails and I like we're geared up to have the
[5434.36 → 5439.64] talk you know because brand suggestions for that stuff they're never good they're usually terrible and i
[5439.64 → 5445.72] started talking, and they were like just do whatever like gets lots of views and I was like okay sweet I will
[5445.96 → 5452.84] nice so um yeah they just immediately back down we're like yeah no I mean you're here because
[5452.84 → 5459.16] like that's what you do, and we're doing this because this is what we do uh so yeah you do
[5459.16 → 5463.80] you think that's pretty sick yeah no dude i uh I don't know i I told the I told the business team
[5463.80 → 5469.16] that basically I don't I don't travel any more you know if a brand asks hey uh how much of a bag of
[5469.16 → 5475.16] money does it take to get Linus to travel anymore and I just say no right but what I will
[5475.16 → 5482.52] travel for is something I like would have done anyway i if is it's something that like ticks off
[5482.52 → 5486.92] something on my bucket list i I'll get on the plane it's like and I know i I probably sound a
[5486.92 → 5493.32] little spoiled right now but the reality of it is that I spent a lot of years travelling way too much
[5493.32 → 5502.44] uh it was hard on my body uh it was hard on my family and um the reduction in travel because
[5502.44 → 5508.92] of covid really opened my eyes to and not just mine because I've always felt like couldn't this just be
[5508.92 → 5513.24] a conference call you know like I've always had that mindset but I think it opened a lot of people's
[5513.24 → 5520.92] eyes to how much of what we do in person could just be done remotely and um forced people to work
[5520.92 → 5526.04] around that nobody was really travelling, and my whole thing has been like okay well why don't I just
[5527.96 → 5533.32] keep it that way um so i I still do travel a little bit I mean I did computer I did CES this year I'm
[5533.32 → 5539.00] going to do CES I'll do computer again um you know obviously i you know i I did the micron a facility
[5539.00 → 5545.24] tour but wouldn't you go to micron yes exactly why yeah but i I want to go everywhere um that's true
[5545.24 → 5550.68] why are you really going to computer though if we're being real to play badminton yes yeah
[5552.12 → 5557.32] but I'm going to CES because I just like should probably be there CES yeah yeah c-e-s like I hate
[5557.32 → 5565.40] c-e-s no offence if you live in fabulous Las Vegas, but it is not it's not my kind of town I like uh
[5565.40 → 5572.68] I like a know a book or an interesting article to read and like uh you know a nice spot on the couch
[5572.68 → 5579.08] like that's my idea of a good time i i I love a stage place and like i'll, i would
[5579.08 → 5584.36] do that you know I'd, I'd hop down to Vegas to like you know watch a couple shows or something
[5584.36 → 5592.84] like that but like in general the Vegas vibe not my thing I don't like yeah sorry it is not a town
[5592.84 → 5600.36] made for either of us yeah and no judgment if you're into Vegas hey you do you go have fun yeah
[5600.36 → 5606.52] what are we supposed to be doing right now we should probably head into when after dark oh no
[5606.52 → 5614.36] I want to talk about small town panopticon sued in court what the institute for justice a non-profit
[5614.36 → 5619.56] public interest law firm is suing the city of Norfolk Virginia over its extensive network of
[5619.56 → 5624.52] security cameras that use automatic license plate readers to log every passing car alongside the car's
[5624.52 → 5632.28] colour make model and any distinctive characteristics officials including police can then request the
[5632.28 → 5639.64] system give them a list of locations a car has been created lists of cars that visited specific locations
[5639.64 → 5648.20] and even track cars that are often seen together yeah that the lawsuit aims to either shut down the
[5648.20 → 5653.24] camera system or to require police to obtain a warrant before accessing the feeds or collecting information
[5653.24 → 5659.00] from the database that's right no warrant big yikes this is like something I would expect to be
[5659.00 → 5667.56] reading about like china not the US the fact that this got installed at all and oh by the way these
[5667.56 → 5677.08] cameras are run by flock who has cameras in over 5 000 communities it is unclear at this time how common
[5677.08 → 5683.00] police misuse of this system is, but two well publicized incidents saw a Sedgwick Kansas
[5683.00 → 5688.52] police lieutenant used the system to stalk his estranged wife in October 2022 and a police chief in
[5688.52 → 5694.76] the same city used the system to stalk his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in october 2023 and i
[5694.76 → 5698.84] guarantee you if they stay installed this will keep happening and this type of information is going to
[5698.84 → 5704.44] leak both of those things it is likely that this lawsuit focuses on Norfolk because it is in the
[5704.44 → 5710.44] jurisdiction of the fourth circle uh fourth circuit appeals court which recently ruled against warrantless drone
[5710.44 → 5721.08] surveillance in a different case warrantless drone surveillance oh yikes huge mono yikes
[5723.64 → 5730.36] that's all I really have to say about that um oh no I have something really cool i actually I saw this
[5730.36 → 5740.20] and I just like lost my biz what no I don't want to I'm not going to sing up for an account that's
[5740.20 → 5745.32] fine because I can see what I need to see before the thing pops up there you go yeah dude start
[5745.32 → 5755.56] whatever hold on oh my goodness video conference whatever video conferencing on a plane dude
[5755.56 → 5761.16] Qatar Airways made its first flight using Starlink internet on Tuesday making them the second airline
[5761.16 → 5766.84] to launch Starlink service after Hawaiian Airlines who got theirs in February according to business
[5766.84 → 5773.00] insider who had a representative on the Qatar Airways plane download speeds reached up to 215
[5773.24 → 5780.12] megabit per second that's not for the whole plane that's for one person Qatar Airways plans to make
[5780.12 → 5785.08] Starlink Wi-Fi free to all passengers compared to its regular in-flight Wi-Fi which is extremely slow
[5785.08 → 5790.28] and costs ten dollars per flight that means passengers can even make video calls or live stream
[5790.28 → 5796.20] something that Qatar Airways demonstrated with a video call between their CEO and Starlink CEO Elon
[5796.20 → 5803.08] musk on a prior test flight Qatar Airways plans to roll out the service to around 60 of its fleet in 2025
[5803.08 → 5808.36] United Airlines and Air France have also announced deals with Starlink this cannot come soon enough as
[5808.36 → 5814.84] someone who spends time on planes and would like to get some actual bloody work done yeah I am like
[5814.84 → 5821.56] more excited like I know Starlink's super important for like rural areas and disaster response and all
[5821.56 → 5826.12] of that stuff, and it's like actually a super amazing technology we've we've talked about it before it's
[5826.12 → 5834.92] awesome um this one's going to be more meaningful to my day-to-day life personally so I have personal
[5834.92 → 5838.20] excitement it's also interesting because it notes that you know regular in-flight
[5838.20 → 5843.40] Wi-Fi is expensive and slow and I think it might be just Qatar airlines, but they're planning on
[5843.40 → 5848.76] offering Starlink for free yeah so that tells us something about the relative affordability of it
[5848.76 → 5854.12] yeah because the satellites are just up there they're vibing so you might as well use the capacity
[5854.12 → 5860.12] unless I have a strong work reason I don't tend to get in-flight Wi-Fi anyway dude I'm not talking
[5860.12 → 5865.40] about conference calls I'm talking about like just being able to access the freaking internet at a
[5865.40 → 5871.40] reasonable speed it cut out for like probably an hour of my flight to Toronto and then like 45
[5871.40 → 5876.04] minutes of my flight back like it's not it's not usable oh right I remember why I started talking
[5876.04 → 5881.24] about Equinix because that was this week and I totally forgot because I flew out Sunday night
[5881.96 → 5886.92] I had that shoot for like 12 13 hours on Monday and then I took the red eye back home so that i
[5886.92 → 5892.36] could be home in time for the mighty car mods club Tuesday morning so this week I'm just like I think
[5892.36 → 5899.56] that's I had badminton training on Tuesday night which was this with the guy that I'm like it's
[5899.56 → 5904.60] not with a coach, but he's like done some coaching, but also we're both doing everything like we're just
[5904.60 → 5908.92] trying to like to help each other improve so we're like both feeding and like both doing the footwork
[5908.92 → 5914.68] drills and stuff like that at the same time so I had that that was crazy my legs are so much
[5914.68 → 5918.76] in very much pain than like Wednesday I don't remember even what happened Wednesday and then Thursday
[5918.76 → 5923.08] yesterday I had training again because I'm trying to I'm trying to like get good for a tournament in
[5923.08 → 5932.12] December so like I'm just i I have no idea what's going on man yeah sorry what are we talking about
[5933.32 → 5940.20] oh dude I'm sorry we will get to some merch messages uh I guess we kind of we kind of
[5941.16 → 5946.12] ah let's power through these two we can do them both pretty quick chrome is purging you origin the
[5946.12 → 5951.32] extension page in the Chrome web store is still up, but some users are reporting pop-ups from chrome
[5951.32 → 5956.60] telling them that you block origin is now unsupported and turning the extension off google
[5956.60 → 5961.64] says that its new newly rolled out manifest v3 framework still allows developers to create ad
[5961.64 → 5966.76] blockers for chrome but many you block users however are talking about moving to Firefox or
[5966.76 → 5971.08] brave because of this interruption um discussion question how many people are actually going to
[5971.08 → 5977.64] switch off of chrome and is it enough to matter uh I don't think it's going to be that many people
[5979.88 → 5985.72] we'll see, but hopefully it will be i mean people i I think a lot of people thought internet
[5985.72 → 5991.24] explorer was unassailable at one point they had like 90 plus market share or whatever it was so
[5991.80 → 5997.56] anything can change anything can change do a Firefox poll now no I don't feel like being lied to right
[5997.56 → 6005.64] now which is why I'm not going to okay Dan can you uh can you move our box yep darn it um not only does
[6005.64 → 6011.56] the new designs of the product pages and stuff in the labs' website look all super neat and
[6011.56 → 6018.76] we're writing cooler articles and things like that, but there's a little bit of I don't know if you've
[6018.76 → 6026.92] been no way just for you guys just for all of you float plane members that was not my idea um
[6026.92 → 6035.24] but I think it's hilarious so if it's there um yeah all right because I don't feel like being lied to
[6035.24 → 6045.96] right now I'm not going to buy an AMD um new b840 motherboard AMD's new 800 series motherboards
[6045.96 → 6052.84] are a mess according to a recent article over on DA developers who have been who has been strongly
[6052.84 → 6059.32] critical of AMD's new motherboards so for starters the b840 is named as though it is a b-tier chipset
[6059.32 → 6065.00] which typically allows CPU overclocking, but instead it not only doesn't have overclocking support like
[6065.00 → 6070.92] last generation's budget a620 but uh boards it is arguably worse than the a620 because it only supports
[6070.92 → 6078.52] PCI Express gen 3 for graphics and storage while a620 supports gen 4. DA also claims that the rest
[6078.52 → 6085.64] of the chipsets aren't really that different from last gen the x870e only adds mandatory usb4 to the
[6085.64 → 6096.12] x670e specs while the x870 adds that and a PCIE 5.0 slot a PCIE 5.0 slot is also the only upgrade that
[6096.12 → 6101.32] b850 has over b650 the conclusion reached by DA is that these upgrades don't justify the price
[6101.32 → 6107.00] increase and AMD is resorting to shady naming tactics agreed comparable to NVIDIA's infamous
[6107.00 → 6114.12] 480 12 gig controversy it's almost like AMD was never your friend yeah
[6117.08 → 6123.08] they want your money careful people are going to get mad I am dude I am so tired of deceptive naming
[6123.08 → 6127.48] schemes I know I keep talking about how I want to be like more positive in our coverage but i just
[6128.68 → 6133.72] you just you see so much of it and i think that a lot of the time it's easy for people to watch
[6133.72 → 6137.56] our content and go well that doesn't seem like that big of a deal, and it's like yeah, but it's cumulative
[6137.56 → 6141.48] you know like it eats at you like you see this kind of stuff over and over and over again you see
[6141.48 → 6148.60] people make mistakes and like you know you read about people who are getting confused by it, you know
[6148.60 → 6154.92] like you'll see people oh I want to I want a core i7 you know not realizing that they're buying an
[6154.92 → 6162.28] ultralight laptop and that core i7 is not fast and like probably doesn't matter compared to the core i5 for
[6164.12 → 6171.88] editing documents right like it's just the way that I just wish that we could market honestly
[6171.88 → 6178.76] because honest marketing is if you have a good product is actually better educating your customers
[6178.76 → 6182.60] turns them into informed customers it turns them into advocates for your brand like it
[6185.08 → 6187.88] maybe that's my new career be like a marketing consultant
[6189.08 → 6193.56] you know go and tell them to be less stupid yeah wasn't that that was a direction
[6194.92 → 6198.92] at one point potentially yeah I mean it's something I considered I never had an offer for
[6198.92 → 6205.88] it is though like that's not what WD offered me no, no they wanted me to like lead marketing for
[6205.88 → 6211.40] or be on a marketing group no not lead it no I was gonna work for I forget her name anyway yeah no i
[6211.40 → 6215.08] I wouldn't, I wouldn't be high up enough to have actually made a difference I don't think looking back on it now
[6218.28 → 6223.88] all right uh what else we got oh wash your bottle kids so these are my friends
[6223.88 → 6237.32] this oh my god seriously um what Dan are you logged into Reddit I think so what I can do I can just
[6237.32 → 6244.44] post the there we go uh do you want to zoom in, so this is why we redesigned the water bottle lid
[6244.44 → 6254.52] making it much easier to pull out your o-ring and wash it yes it was worth it that's a moose
[6254.52 → 6258.84] that's a moose nice moose what about the added flavour show me your moose
[6261.64 → 6267.64] okay we alluded to this earlier but the last big one this week is arm cancels Qualcomm's license
[6268.36 → 6272.52] this week arm gave 60 days notice to Qualcomm they're cancelling their architectural license
[6272.52 → 6278.84] agreement on grounds of repeated material breaches to the agreement notably arm will be facing Qualcomm
[6278.84 → 6284.36] at trial in just 51 days over Qualcomm's acquisition of CPU startup Núria um
[6287.16 → 6293.88] Núria's license was supposed to only allow server chip applications and was supposed to be non-transferable
[6293.88 → 6300.44] but Qualcomm has just been like using it notably in the snapdragon x elite laptop chips that they released
[6300.44 → 6306.12] this year both companies stock prices fell in response to the announcement of arms decisions
[6307.00 → 6317.40] i have to think they're bluffing I agree but to what end like why is media tech really going to pick up
[6317.40 → 6322.84] the slack in the phone space no like immediately well no, no no they're better than you probably realize
[6322.84 → 6326.76] I think it's probably been a while since you've looked at media tech's latest stuff, and they're actually
[6326.76 → 6336.20] like pretty good now okay yeah all come lost an arm i really just want risk to win um that's very
[6336.20 → 6343.32] funny and this is the kind of stuff that if arm just is why just acts like a petulant child about
[6343.32 → 6349.88] things and I mean in fairness they did break terms in fairness yeah yeah it's not Qualcomm is
[6349.88 → 6356.76] almost certainly not um not going to come out of this looking like saints either like licensing agreements
[6356.76 → 6365.24] do exist for a reason all right Dan it's time for after dark let's do it one dowie i have to push the button
[6365.24 → 6371.32] and then do the purple
[6374.84 → 6375.24] purple
[6376.84 → 6382.20] okay thanks Dan you're welcome merch messages hey DLL sitting here listening to the stream doing my

[6452.68 → 6457.16] podcast this book you said interesting book I would absolutely not say this is
[6458.68 → 6461.16] the best book I don't even know if I'd say it's an amazing book
[6461.88 → 6465.00] I haven't I don't think I've recommended it to anyone it's always risky to give a book
[6465.00 → 6468.92] recommendation right because like people are going to judge you immediately I'm going to
[6468.92 → 6475.16] deeply your whole soul is about to be judged because they go ahead they said interesting book
[6475.16 → 6479.08] okay interesting, and it is an interesting book s
[6481.64 → 6488.60] 3.86 out of uh five and it probably that's probably justified it the plot is not that amazing, but it's a
[6488.60 → 6495.08] very interesting book it's sealed when you buy it you have to break the seal on it and then there's
[6495.08 → 6498.92] pieces of like evidence okay you know they're looking for stuff that they can listen to as an
[6498.92 → 6506.92] audiobook right no okay I didn't know that part um neat let's move on probably I've got a lot of
[6506.92 → 6511.96] audiobooks hold on a second okay all right yeah Dan why don't you read me another one while Luke
[6511.96 → 6515.16] finds some good audiobooks okay sure excited for the
[6518.76 → 6524.28] uh excited about the MCM collab video after collaborating with the world's best
[6524.28 → 6528.84] off-roading YouTube channel are there any other non-tech channels that would make for an
[6528.84 → 6535.80] interesting collaboration um Plato's the republic narrated by ray child's or chilled's I'm not sure
[6535.80 → 6540.92] which one it is there you go it does a very good job it's its a perfect listen there you go
[6540.92 → 6546.68] go with that instead um thank you Luke that was much more helpful or bars elephant graveyard
[6546.68 → 6552.36] also very good okay I'm going to lean on I'm going to lean on my co-hosts again i I don't really watch
[6552.36 → 6557.64] YouTube much any other non-tech channels that would make for an interesting collaboration channels
[6561.08 → 6565.80] I don't know non-tech channels I would love to see you with a click spring
[6566.68 → 6573.72] what's that he's doing an analog uh version of the antikythera mechanism I guess that would be a
[6573.72 → 6577.80] tech channel because the antikythera mechanism is technically a computer tech channel
[6577.80 → 6583.56] but he does machine videos I'd love to do like uh how wide do you go with tech I think it'd be
[6583.56 → 6589.96] kind of cool to do like um like uh like workstation effectiveness analysis with like an
[6589.96 → 6596.28] engineering channel or like an animation channel or something like that because that's a space that's
[6596.28 → 6602.60] really not well documented in terms of like how to benchmark same with like music production so we bring
[6602.60 → 6607.40] in like a bunch we basically like bring in like four machines or something like that, and we go okay
[6607.40 → 6613.80] we built what we think is like a good better the best ultimate do your thing you know we'll watch
[6614.60 → 6619.08] let's see let's see if any of this matters you know um I think something like that would be pretty cool
[6621.16 → 6628.60] yeah if I mean you could work with like bon appétit or something and oh yeah find like you know gamers
[6628.60 → 6633.40] are notorious for not wanting to spend time cooking because I mean they could be gaming obviously Bon
[6633.40 → 6638.60] appetite gamer meals yeah gamer meals from bon appétit could be pretty sick we have a big sponsorship coming
[6638.60 → 6645.88] up the deal's not actually inked and I want them to be the one to announce it not use um but uh wait why
[6645.88 → 6651.56] are you talking about it well I'm not going to say who it is oh yeah but LTT store is uh is on kind of
[6651.56 → 6658.52] like a sponsorship drive right now uh sponsoring other YouTubers so we're working on some stuff so I'm
[6658.52 → 6664.84] not going to tell you who it is but what I will tell you is that it's someone that float plane chat
[6664.84 → 6671.32] has mentioned in the last two minutes oh yeah, and it's a pretty it's a pretty sizeable sponsorship
[6671.32 → 6678.20] dollar amount it's its comfortably five figures so it's like whoa they're a pretty big deal okay yeah
[6678.20 → 6685.56] I'm pretty excited um I'm trying to think what it's not lunch ables
[6685.56 → 6694.84] oh I'm disappointed can you survive eating mould for more than a week well I'll pay you a five
[6694.84 → 6701.88] figure sponsorship to find out minus stomach pump tips that would actually be a hilarious like Mr
[6701.88 → 6709.40] beast style video parody how much mouldy lunch ables cheese can you eat like the last person to the last
[6709.40 → 6715.56] person to be eating linkable mouldy cheese wins this car we water cooled your dialysis machine yeah
[6715.56 → 6721.80] doing some form of like computer experiment thing using science Mindy hank green something like
[6721.80 → 6728.60] that could be good and green seems super cool yep um everyone else is like too closely related like
[6728.60 → 6732.68] even an electro boom is probably too close we've already collabed with them, I've hung out with smash a
[6732.68 → 6738.44] couple times at events and stuff they're like super cool that could be fun yeah Kurtz Kazakh I can think of a
[6738.44 → 6743.80] few different ways that you could even do that as well I think for me at this point in my career
[6743.80 → 6748.68] honestly I've kind of done I've kind of done it all when it comes to tech I'd rather I'd rather go on
[6748.68 → 6754.68] someone else's channel now I think just like yeah I don't know you're doing something like weird yeah
[6754.68 → 6758.68] let's play like practically anything yeah let's play paintball with you know grape juice you have to
[6758.68 → 6761.88] catch it in your mouth like I don't know like whatever kind of i I don't know just
[6761.88 → 6765.64] you get grape to the mouth that's an example
[6769.40 → 6770.84] Linus gets tied to the radiator
[6773.24 → 6774.20] oh my god
[6778.44 → 6783.00] I was not expecting that reference oh man okay
[6783.00 → 6791.64] five second films yeah oh that would be fun dude I used to watch those guys in university oh
[6791.64 → 6795.80] they've they're back they took a very long break I've heard yeah I'm gonna grape you
[6797.24 → 6804.84] what is going on oh my god I'm the grapeest I don't even know this reference and I don't want to google
[6804.84 → 6817.72] like okay oh is it the whitest kids you know yeah oh okay I remember now uh it's a reference guy yeah
[6817.72 → 6823.32] it's a reference okay um great I don't know I'd have to like to bring up my YouTube and figure it out
[6823.32 → 6827.00] very hard to watch I think practically anyone to be completely honest
[6827.00 → 6835.48] yeah anyway moving on uh hey dally finally buying something from the store how is progress
[6835.48 → 6840.52] going with the city and the badminton centre we submitted our package to the city um they
[6841.96 → 6850.04] have not gotten back to us like about the result but this is promising they did get back to us to
[6850.04 → 6855.16] say that they have received our package and that they have scheduled a meeting to discuss it
[6855.16 → 6863.00] and uh that they would follow up with us with a decision and next steps that's good which to me
[6863.48 → 6867.56] sounds like there are next steps considering there's next steps mentioned I mean it's good
[6867.56 → 6873.16] that you heard anything yeah and the fact that they're on it that's always a sign how quickly you
[6873.16 → 6878.12] get an email back tells you more than probably anything else about how important something is to
[6878.12 → 6883.24] the person on the other side sad what there's a project that I'm working on
[6883.24 → 6888.68] on took like over a month for them to respond recently, but then we had a meeting about it this
[6888.68 → 6892.68] week, and now we have meetings about it every week moving forward okay so it's probably fine now okay
[6893.64 → 6897.72] well or I could tell you something about how busy the other person is remember it's relative
[6897.72 → 6901.88] right we can't change multiple variables you can't compare one person to another person true
[6901.88 → 6907.72] I'm just saying that if you had worked with the city in the past, and they would take a month or never
[6907.72 → 6912.92] to reply to your emails, and they're working with them now, and they're like on it same day next day
[6912.92 → 6918.12] a couple of days that's good you're a priority that's good yeah you're a high priority so I'm I'm really
[6918.12 → 6925.24] I'm really, really optimistic about whale land I'm really excited yeah um as for the badminton centre
[6925.24 → 6932.92] good it's been soft open for almost a month now I think and next week we are going to move the evening
[6932.92 → 6940.68] the very evening 7 to 10 p.m uh drop-in session to be paid wait are the new floors in no so only
[6940.68 → 6945.40] one side is open, and we have signs up everywhere saying that the floors are temporary so what's
[6945.40 → 6951.32] going to happen is we have placed the PO for our new floors they're from victor uh they have said
[6951.32 → 6957.88] six to ten weeks for production um once they arrive the same company that installed our floors is going
[6957.88 → 6962.60] to install these for us because they did a great job of the installation just the defective material
[6963.08 → 6967.88] um so they're going to install it on the side that is currently unfinished then we're going to move
[6967.88 → 6971.88] all our programs over there then they're going to go on the side that is finished now they're going to
[6971.88 → 6976.44] rip out the bad parts they're going to put in the new parts, and then they're going to go away and then
[6976.44 → 6982.76] it will actually be finished good cool very exciting super exciting I wasn't expecting there to be so many
[6982.76 → 6988.52] people there it's very popular right it was amazing yeah this whole time Dan thought he was building a
[6988.52 → 6994.20] giant facility for just me to toy with because I was there by myself for until like 1 p.m and I thought
[6994.20 → 7000.44] oh man this place is dead Linus has no clients and then like 400 people showed up and all the
[7000.44 → 7006.04] courts were jammed and I was like all right maybe linus shouldn't have been doubted ever
[7006.04 → 7013.96] friends and family right now um well people they uh the best way to get people to tell everyone they
[7013.96 → 7018.60] know about something is to tell them not to tell anybody so we I don't know its friends and friends
[7018.60 → 7022.92] of friends and friends of friends to my knowledge we have never posted it publicly yet
[7022.92 → 7030.52] and yet every time I go in there I hardly recognize anybody um and I think we have over a thousand
[7030.52 → 7035.24] people on in our customer database now my parents told a couple of their friends about it, and they're
[7035.24 → 7039.64] like oh my god I love badminton there's nowhere to play we're going to go there yeah I had no idea
[7039.64 → 7043.40] badminton was this popular it's incredible are you gonna are you gonna work out with me again when
[7043.40 → 7048.04] there's a gym at the badminton centre absolutely yeah my life is calming down a lot I mean I'll come
[7048.04 → 7052.84] back to the normal gym I feel bad let's feel bad I'm back to where I was good
[7052.84 → 7060.04] for the sickness good I got a long way to recovery, but things are calming heck yeah we'll get there
[7060.04 → 7066.52] yeah all right what else we got hi question for Linus in supreme commander how do you deal with
[7066.52 → 7074.52] end game lag when all the players get to unit cap same faster skill issue Polaris verbal space program
[7074.52 → 7079.88] minecraft no it is a real problem uh even though it's an old game like what is it like 2008 or something
[7079.88 → 7083.32] like that I can't remember when supreme commander came out off the top of my head but even though
[7083.32 → 7091.96] it's an older game it's single threaded um and so even modern processors struggle to handle the
[7091.96 → 7100.28] maximum unit counts on these like gigantic 40 kilometre square maps um and as if anyone is anybody
[7100.28 → 7107.64] in the lobby has a slower computer it slows down the game for everybody because um the sim everyone has
[7107.64 → 7113.32] to be able to handle the sim uh, so the combat is all physics based in the game so because you're
[7113.32 → 7120.12] swimming every moving projectile on the entire map it's uh it gets pretty ridiculous it is fair that it
[7120.12 → 7127.96] gets ridiculous yeah yeah um, but yeah there's not really much you can do about it get good get better
[7127.96 → 7134.44] computers I don't I don't know man promote mindless consumerism buy more computers yeah good make sure that
[7134.44 → 7141.24] when you're doing that they're notably powered by batteries yeah lithium batteries yeah with lots of
[7141.24 → 7148.36] ideally as much cobalt as possible yeah and have them flown in yeah yes and lead yep get lead in your
[7148.36 → 7156.68] batteries to get the lead out any updates on a potential collab with big time would love to see
[7156.68 → 7162.44] some LTT staff subject to Jerry's lie detector test I don't know that sounds hilarious um and
[7162.44 → 7169.40] i I don't know if I don't think we have anything planned like collab wise but i I did say before
[7169.40 → 7175.24] that I would love to sponsor big time I don't actually know where we are at on that I don't
[7175.24 → 7181.00] know if I've gotten an update, but the team knows that I would like to do that so hopefully I'd like
[7181.00 → 7186.52] to work with them hopefully someday we will get uh I'll, I'll get like my phone blowing up like oh my
[7186.52 → 7193.96] goodness I saw your screwdriver on big time so we'll see hey Luke's mom and DLL what are your
[7193.96 → 7200.92] thoughts on cod bluffs six having an advanced audio subscription what's next charging to unlock the
[7200.92 → 7210.44] frame rate wait what I don't know like surround sound also I thought it was bloops oh no that's
[7210.44 → 7219.00] yeah I've always called it bloops what enhanced audio what audio subscription do you need to buy it
[7219.00 → 7225.72] how did I not how did I not see this okay so sorry I'm on read write.com which I've also never
[7225.72 → 7233.00] heard of uh enhanced headphone mode designed to give you more immersive sound using tech from embody
[7233.00 → 7240.68] directional accuracy did we come full circle all the way back to EAX
[7242.76 → 7248.52] are they not using like food or woo wise which is spatial audio you can unlock a five-year license
[7248.52 → 7254.28] for personalized sound profile through embodies immersed spatial audio technology what is this
[7255.80 → 7262.68] I mean it's not unprecedented to have to pay for a subscription or pay for oh yes it's like Atmos
[7263.00 → 7267.96] to have to pay yeah like Atmos and windows like to have to pay for like a Kodak or
[7269.40 → 7274.84] but accurate placement of sounds which can be helpful multiplayer audio cues like footsteps' gunfire
[7275.48 → 7282.28] 20 for a five-year license I mean that doesn't for the amount of money that you're going to spend on like
[7282.28 → 7291.72] dogs right it doesn't seem wasn't it cod that had the stupid dog that you could buy that you were so
[7291.72 → 7297.88] upset about no oh was that battlefield no it was a which one was it RTS game I don't remember name are
[7297.88 → 7304.84] you sure yeah whatever the point is some like nonsense cosmetic for the amount of money you're
[7304.84 → 7312.92] going to spend on that um this doesn't seem that unreasonable especially if they're is it's effectively
[7312.92 → 7320.84] just licensing a third party audio tech with that said I think that this is what like a 90 Canadian
[7320.84 → 7328.60] dollar game like if you're spending that much on this game than I mean is it not pretty reasonable
[7328.60 → 7334.44] for them to just include good audio in it also like knowing that you're at a disadvantage compared
[7334.44 → 7338.28] to other players because you didn't pay the subscription that goes along with the game is
[7338.28 → 7344.44] that's how they get you a little rough valve recently released a spatial audio tool as well
[7345.56 → 7346.44] based valve again
[7351.72 → 7357.32] some Final Fantasy 14 fans this is according to readwrite.com where the service has been available
[7357.32 → 7362.68] for a while have expressed dissatisfaction comparing it to similar technologies like Dolby Atmos
[7362.68 → 7369.40] which some say offer comparable spatial audio without the extra cost uh all right well good luck
[7369.40 → 7378.84] everybody ah man I had decided to not do the whole cod blog six things and now I'm happy about that decision
[7380.44 → 7386.68] I miss like having shooters to play you're going to turn into a non-gamer basically dude yeah you're going to be a
[7386.68 → 7392.76] non-gamer until like Balder's gate 4 comes out yeah and that'll be in like it'll be like 50 that's
[7392.76 → 7399.00] going to be by like Hasbro or whoever it's not going to be by Marian oh really Marian lost the license no they just left
[7399.00 → 7405.16] oh yeah based Marian yeah all right yeah the next game that Marian makes is not going to be
[7406.12 → 7410.20] uh baller's gate wow Hasbro is going to bung it up
[7410.20 → 7418.28] like so bad they have quite the blueprint to at least make no like you know far cry 17.
[7418.28 → 7419.96] okay tell you what no I'm going to stop you right there
[7421.80 → 7429.40] show me a like Hasbro show me a Hasbro game studios game that's like good what games did they
[7429.40 → 7434.52] made I remember getting their monopoly game in my cereal box when I was a kid I was going to say
[7434.52 → 7437.96] actually those games are pretty good there was boggled monopoly I forget which other one I know I've
[7437.96 → 7441.64] launched games that had the Hasbro logo that I liked and then I went back and remembered that it
[7441.64 → 7449.16] was those I don't just their board games but on a CD all right what Hasbro video games Hasbro studio
[7450.04 → 7456.60] video games what games did they made yeah I know they did that billion dollar investment um like this
[7456.60 → 7462.44] year basically they saw balls gate 3 pop off, and they're like huh a billion dollars yeah I don't know
[7462.44 → 7467.72] if it's called Hasbro game studios I just like I know that they're working on some stuff wait Hasbro games
[7467.72 → 7474.28] as an Ubisoft mech warriors 3 pirates moon I think that was the worst mech warriors game ever made
[7477.16 → 7481.24] huh, huh they made glover classic
[7482.92 → 7491.40] hmm moving on all right cool good luck everybody yeah hey LLD Linus how's the iPhone going and how
[7491.40 → 7499.88] long do you plan to use it for also any idea when the retro pet cave will ever come back uh, uh our
[7499.88 → 7505.64] second order of the retro pet cave was a disaster they were the wrong colour they're all marshy oh we're
[7505.64 → 7511.32] working on it but like it's the exact same suppliers like how'd they screw that up I don't get it like just
[7511.32 → 7518.28] do the same thing you did last time just don't swap a Rooney it drives me crazy you guys it drives me
[7518.28 → 7526.76] crazy dude I have so many more notes on my thing like this doc is so long um like there's man so many
[7526.76 → 7531.16] of them are just little things that iPhone people are going to tell me don't matter and I'm like yeah
[7531.16 → 7539.80] to you, I guess but to me, they do like when you are okay have you ever have you ever noticed this on an
[7539.80 → 7547.24] iPhone when you scroll you're slow no, no not that oh um here it's a lot more noticeable
[7547.24 → 7553.96] in the YouTube studio app which I use a fair bit to uh like read comments and stuff its community oh
[7553.96 → 7560.60] oh it's the community tab now they made an update okay so do you crying out loud okay, okay so as I'm
[7560.60 → 7561.80] scrolling do you notice anything
[7565.96 → 7570.92] not really do you notice that it highlights the comment that I click on even though I'm not
[7570.92 → 7576.04] interacting with that comment not always I did notice that happened a couple of times but no I'm just
[7576.04 → 7579.96] scrolling, and it highlights the comment since you mentioned it I don't think it's happened
[7579.96 → 7587.56] you know what if it's already moving it doesn't there you go yeah so see that yeah highlights the
[7587.56 → 7600.60] comment yeah why what other modern interface will act like you have activated an element on screen
[7600.60 → 7602.52] when you're actually just scrolling
[7602.52 → 7608.36] if you do it really fast does it happen yeah watch
[7611.88 → 7617.56] does it every single time why it makes me feel like I'm mis clicking stuff all the time what do
[7617.56 → 7625.24] you mean because you touched it no incorrect literally windows doesn't do that on touchscreens
[7625.80 → 7629.80] android doesn't do that on touchscreens it's really misleading because it makes you seem like you're
[7629.80 → 7635.96] interacting with that element, but you're not I'm trying to think what would cause it I feel like
[7635.96 → 7642.20] it's like it's delay on interacting with that element is really low or something or no, no because
[7642.20 → 7647.48] it doesn't interact with it is knows I'm just scrolling uh yeah but if you like held press
[7647.48 → 7655.32] on that would it do that animation of you interacting with it in the exact same way because if so then you're
[7655.32 → 7662.28] just not hold pressing it long enough okay just no it doesn't do anything it just keeps highlighting it
[7666.20 → 7671.48] yeah so I have to tap it in order for it to actually do anything but if I scroll and i if i
[7671.48 → 7677.08] touch it first when I scroll or if I just hold it is just like highlights it yeah and then doesn't
[7677.08 → 7681.72] actually activate it is it just people are commenting is it just the YouTube app no yeah
[7681.72 → 7688.92] no it does it in uh it does it in like my news feed and stuff like that like it why I thought
[7688.92 → 7695.16] you're supposed to be a paragon of like design and UX like this is obviously wrong design and UX is
[7695.16 → 7701.16] subjective um I'm also experiencing the bug where my ringer volume gets sometimes bugged and goes super
[7701.16 → 7708.28] loud literally interrupted a shoot because my uh my ringer was set to like this much, and it was like
[7708.28 → 7713.72] like going off in the middle of the shoot like it's been so buggy that made me think dude i
[7713.72 → 7719.80] should I should change my ringer to the ever quest level up sound most people aren't going to get why
[7719.80 → 7728.76] that's yeah anyway um oh what was this what was this uh what was this note uh convenience oh yeah oh
[7728.76 → 7735.56] dude when you're connected to CarPlay if you take a system screenshot it sends your CarPlay screenshot as well
[7735.56 → 7742.36] what yeah and as i I'm sure there's a way to UN that it, but it was not super obvious and I was
[7743.00 → 7749.16] um busy so I didn't deal with it, but it's on my list of things to figure out as well so like it sends
[7749.16 → 7754.76] both like two separate things, or they like stitched together they're like stitched together um I ran into
[7754.76 → 7760.04] a crazy bug uh that I recorded on my note 9 where touch wasn't registering in the right spot I recorded
[7760.04 → 7765.32] that so I'll have that uh I mean again there's lots of cool stuff so since the last time we talked
[7766.12 → 7771.64] the phone noticed that i never really like to deplete the battery and automatically recommend it i
[7771.64 → 7776.84] switch over to limiting it to 80 to optimize the long-term life that's really cool that's cool
[7776.84 → 7783.08] um I really like the way there's a little pop-up on the island if you uh get a call on this and your
[7783.08 → 7788.28] AirPods are on you but like paired to something else and this was to a windows' laptop so it's not like
[7788.28 → 7792.60] they were talking oh it can like to suggest you to take it was like hey can I grab can I grab that
[7792.60 → 7797.16] instead of just grabbing it you know like your car will do that was really cool, so there's lots of
[7797.16 → 7805.32] really cool stuff lots of really cool stuff um and lots of stuff that's just like completely obvious
[7805.32 → 7809.56] garbage handyman is saying that it's individual screenshots when CarPlay's active not that they're
[7809.56 → 7816.68] stitched oh okay sure well when you're using the share interface which is what I use um they're both
[7816.68 → 7821.88] there and there wasn't an obvious way to get rid of the other one interesting so i accidentally when
[7821.88 → 7832.04] I was messaging proof uh sent him both my answer and my location oh yeah that is stitched it looks
[7832.52 → 7836.28] like it wait is that two separate files I don't know click it yeah it might be too I know I can't
[7836.28 → 7842.12] because this is just a screenshot yeah uh the point is just that it was I wasn't expecting to send him
[7842.12 → 7849.16] like a screenshot of my map on CarPlay that was not what I was not what I intended to do um
[7850.36 → 7851.80] no I haven't had the flashlight bug
[7854.92 → 7862.44] yeah so overall i I don't really um I don't really like if it's really buggy I was expecting a
[7862.44 → 7867.40] lot more just works and a lot less well there was the time when my phone just cut out when you called me
[7867.40 → 7875.56] that yeah like turned off like just turned, and it was weird because on my end the call didn't even
[7875.56 → 7883.32] disconnect and he is call history has a log of our call connecting and mine doesn't like it just
[7884.20 → 7889.08] has no idea that that ever happened the android phone just overpowered the iPhone yeah I guess so
[7889.08 → 7896.60] yeah how is it still buggy they have one phone everything's going to have bugs dude yeah you can't
[7896.60 → 7902.20] you can't say how is anything still buggy everything ever is going to have bugs just hire a second dev they
[7902.20 → 7910.36] legitimately they legitimately changed a lot in iOS 18. They just um I don't know it could be it could be
[7910.36 → 7917.80] way better it could be way better all right software is gonna software yeah I hate computers at shorty
[7917.80 → 7922.60] swift you've spoken a few times about your disdain for sleep country on the show, but you've never
[7922.60 → 7930.76] really delved into it stop that care to share more info as to why you dislike them so much I will do you
[7930.76 → 7935.96] one better and I will direct you to the place where you can go to learn all about mattresses
[7935.96 → 7948.28] mattress underground.com is based you're welcome sick typical Monday listener here what's the most
[7948.28 → 7956.60] wasted qualifications that you have encountered oh a plus uh oh god no, no that'd be something like with
[7956.60 → 7963.64] a PhD yeah that's the opposite yeah no we have some people who work here who have like just
[7964.44 → 7971.32] ridiculous credentials but um do stuff here that has nothing to do with them at all like almost
[7971.32 → 7977.16] any PhD where you're ending up anywhere other than like research and engineering or education it feels like
[7978.44 → 7984.36] maybe you like you can get paid more for it like if you have a PhD I think you get paid more as like a
[7984.36 → 7989.32] counsellor or a teacher for example like in the public sector but the reality of it is once you're
[7989.32 → 7994.76] in the private sector your initial compensation is going to be you know whatever it is whatever you
[7994.76 → 8000.44] negotiate with your employer but then beyond that your PhD is not going to like to get you a raise next
[8000.44 → 8007.88] year you're going to have to perform so yeah maybe that helps you do that maybe it doesn't maybe it doesn't
[8007.88 → 8015.96] I have a ballet degree yeah I could see that not necessarily getting you much unless you wanted to
[8015.96 → 8021.16] be a ballet teacher yeah there are a lot of degrees that are like if you want to teach the thing that
[8021.16 → 8031.80] you got your degree in great if not there's nothing yep hi DLL does the float plane tech stack utilize
[8031.80 → 8037.00] open source software if so do you worry that license changes like what happened with Regis
[8037.00 → 8043.16] could impact future maintainability we do and yes, but that's also a problem with not open source
[8043.16 → 8048.60] software sure is so like a big problem it's potentially a bigger one yeah we're having an
[8048.60 → 8052.36] issue I'm not going to name them, but we're having an issue right now with a particular company where we
[8052.36 → 8059.96] wanted to change the tier of like subscription that we had with them um and
[8059.96 → 8067.96] uh oh the way that that is being handled is extremely unsavoury I will say at this point in
[8067.96 → 8073.64] time uh to the point where we might just be completely bailing out which will take development time
[8075.48 → 8082.04] but would be worth it that's okay we'll get them these vests and our developers will code so much
[8082.04 → 8087.40] faster with AI I'll wait till it's done before i I talk about it because it's not it's not done yet
[8087.40 → 8095.08] so naming them now would just be in bad taste um sure but yeah it's like, but we won't hesitate to
[8095.08 → 8100.76] name you if you don't get your act together it's its pretty lame uh what they're they're saying they
[8100.76 → 8109.00] would be doing um so we'll see how it goes I noticed you haven't had any new bonus bin items in a
[8109.00 → 8114.36] while are there any plans to make a 2024 sticker pack another postcard maybe some more of those
[8114.36 → 8119.32] cool pins or anything similar yes Sarah's been busy we definitely have new pins coming and we
[8119.32 → 8124.28] definitely have a 2024 sticker pack in the works it's not everyone's so convinced it's Cloudflare
[8124.28 → 8130.04] the one company I'll say it isn't is Cloudflare yeah don't narrow it down for them anymore though
[8130.04 → 8133.64] I won't, I won't that's where it's AJ the only reason why I'm saying it is just because so many
[8133.64 → 8139.88] people said Cloudflare I understand why you say that yeah we've definitely had some conversations
[8139.88 → 8144.44] with Cloudflare but in this case it is actually not I'm just clarifying that because so
[8144.44 → 8150.04] many people said if it's not Cloudflare this isn't necessarily a question but give me an early
[8150.04 → 8154.60] birthday present next time Linus gets premium access to a company let it be valved I want to see
[8154.60 → 8160.28] inside the company we all have so much invested in with our libraries I'll tell you what our rep
[8160.28 → 8166.04] there super chill she's really nice I will screenshot this and I will send it to her
[8167.32 → 8175.24] nice all right I'm not promising anything literally doing that right now yeah yes a humble request i
[8175.24 → 8181.08] look so serious in the vest every time I watch over the TV I'm like oh yeah you look like you look like
[8181.08 → 8186.76] I'm in my quarterly review meeting I did way too many of those over the last couple of weeks I don't want
[8186.76 → 8193.64] to do any more yeah Luke had to dress up because it's not going to be positive you don't you come
[8193.64 → 8199.56] into like a stained t-shirt yeah this is fine okay next oh man I better put a button up on the no no no
[8201.08 → 8206.04] no the clothes have been looking perfect on you recently must be the tall sizes it's weird yeah it
[8206.04 → 8211.24] might be something to do with the fit yeah interesting never thought about that I had a friend
[8211.24 → 8217.32] come over, and she was immediately like oh my god your shirt looks great I'm like hey tall size I've
[8217.32 → 8224.36] had a non-insignificant amount of people mention that my shirts fit unsurprisingly it's always been
[8224.36 → 8233.00] like you know like my mom like women in my life which there are not many but uh but my mom and uh Emma
[8233.00 → 8238.36] and Emma immediately noticed my mom immediately noticed like it just it actually fits now oh yeah which
[8238.36 → 8241.88] is honestly you know once you've partnered up probably that's pretty much all that matters
[8244.12 → 8248.92] but like it's its interesting how I'm not saying you should avoid other women I'm just saying like no
[8250.04 → 8254.60] I don't know you got the bases covered that's all yeah outside of work like the casual hangout so
[8254.60 → 8261.80] I mean I barely have friends at all these days so yeah I don't know it is what it is its everything's
[8261.80 → 8272.60] okay yeah the shirt's fit though cool hi Wanda it was this easy to get him to show this hard for the
[8272.60 → 8276.92] store I wouldn't have made it this I've been asking for this we told you that this would happen it's been
[8276.92 → 8283.32] very clear there was no miscommunication we said exactly what we needed every week, and now we are
[8283.32 → 8289.72] every week on our side of the deal women have taken notice of us, and they have nice thighs and
[8289.72 → 8302.20] everything oh boy hi Wanda week number two of asking for an update on the 3d printed custom loop oh
[8302.20 → 8307.08] they do updates on float plane which is where we said we would do updates better get subscribed on
[8307.08 → 8312.92] float plane they do not in there I've seen it uh last one I got for you hey LDL I work as a private
[8312.92 → 8318.92] teacher for a family of billionaires the family does pro motorsports if you homeschooled with an
[8318.92 → 8324.44] infinite budget and lots of travel opportunities what would you do I don't think I would homeschool
[8324.44 → 8333.32] my kids um interesting socialization is important yeah maybe not when you're a billionaire yeah maybe
[8333.96 → 8337.72] well I know I would think if anything it would be more important mix uh
[8337.72 → 8343.48] uh that's what they that's why they don't have that's how they feel about everyone else
[8344.12 → 8349.72] I mean I don't know maybe i I can't speak for them, I'm not a billionaire um if you homeschooled with an
[8349.72 → 8354.44] infinite budget and had lots of travel opportunities yeah see okay we got a couple of problems here so
[8354.44 → 8363.96] number one is um at risk of sounding like I look in this vest um my kids can have whatever education they
[8363.96 → 8369.08] want effectively I'd have an infinite education budget for my kids there's no amount of like
[8369.08 → 8376.20] education budget that I couldn't afford at this point um so I like kind of do and except that i
[8376.20 → 8382.20] wouldn't homeschool them like I like just wouldn't do that that's not even that's not even on the menu
[8382.84 → 8383.24] um
[8386.04 → 8391.72] uh I think the homeschooling would be that you hired like people to come and teach them like the world's
[8391.72 → 8397.40] top engineers and lots of practical experiments and demonstrations I think yeah i
[8397.40 → 8403.16] think that'd be cool visiting a lot of here's a laboratory go learn how to do science with a team
[8403.16 → 8410.60] of people to teach you I mean yeah I guess that'd be kind of cool but like ugh because I mean at that
[8410.60 → 8416.76] point in time they don't need to work so all you really need to do is inspire interest so showing them
[8416.76 → 8421.80] how cool things that you can do with the different subjects are gone try everything to find what you're
[8421.80 → 8425.00] interested in, and then we'll dive into that maybe I think so
[8429.48 → 8431.96] make sure they at least know the definition of the word job
[8433.80 → 8438.60] yeah man pretend for a little while I'm just I'm just reading I'm just reading chat right now it's
[8438.60 → 8441.96] it's interesting hearing everyone's sort of different background like yeah I went to homeschool
[8441.96 → 8447.32] it was great I did homeschool it was the worst i I think at the end of the day they're going to make
[8447.32 → 8452.12] the best um I think they're going to make they're going to make whatever they make of whatever they
[8452.12 → 8462.68] have like i I didn't have a fancy education um and so much knowledge is available for free now
[8463.56 → 8470.28] that i just I don't know I don't know if I'm convinced that um that like fancy school and I mean
[8470.28 → 8474.76] travel opportunities could be cool like being able to see things in person instead of
[8474.76 → 8478.04] reading about them in a book and infinite travel opportunities i think there's a lot you
[8478.04 → 8483.88] could also waste a lot of time travelling though like no amount of no amount of money makes it so
[8483.88 → 8488.68] that you know going somewhere far away is instant but when you've got private jets you could have
[8488.68 → 8495.16] like the paperwork stuff that they have to do on the planes yeah I mean I guess so you could just
[8495.16 → 8504.60] like you know let's learn about uh WAC Bennett dam by going there like yeah i guess that that's
[8504.60 → 8515.64] something um here's a helicopter you can learn how to fix it yeah have fun man there's almost too many
[8515.64 → 8519.88] there's almost too many uh there's almost too many options like I wouldn't even know what to do with it
[8519.88 → 8523.88] I have to confess I haven't really given it that much thought I just let the school kind of do their
[8523.88 → 8529.16] curriculum and reading writing arithmetic and a little bit of performing arts and fine arts and
[8530.76 → 8536.68] I mean i would be if I was I don't know if you're clearly not the parent so if i were you
[8536.68 → 8540.84] I would be most concerned about making sure that they're not just like I'm did you just
[8540.84 → 8546.52] accuse Yvonne of cheating what no I'm talking to the person who sent in the merch message um we all
[8546.52 → 8554.28] know Ivan's the real parent yeah that's fair yeah of four kids um
[8557.80 → 8565.40] and 15 cats five we'll get there um but like yeah I don't know showing them
[8566.84 → 8572.36] like the impact of bad things in our oceans and doing beach cleanups yeah this could be cool
[8572.36 → 8577.08] um doing things like that giving them a reason to give a crap about anything
[8579.40 → 8583.80] yeah my fiancé is homeschooled she's mostly normal says t-dog 420 okay
[8587.00 → 8594.52] nice nice nice and I think that's it for the wan show yeah we'll see you again next week same bad time
[8594.52 → 8602.76] same chat channel bye
[8604.04 → 8604.60] you
[8624.52 → 8628.76] It's like anything is kind of education.
