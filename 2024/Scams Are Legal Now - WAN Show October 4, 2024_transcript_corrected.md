[0.00 → 5.46] What's up everyone? Welcome to the WAN show. We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[5.60 → 8.36] I forget what our title was, so... Oh yes, now I remember.
[8.92 → 14.72] Ah, a judge has decided that Elon Musk's statements about, um, you know,
[14.84 → 19.92] the things that their cars were going to do and be capable of were simply puffer,
[20.28 → 21.88] which is not a problem.
[22.02 → 22.50] It's awesome.
[22.62 → 23.56] And not fraudulent.
[23.66 → 26.02] Perfect precedent for advertising.
[26.02 → 30.50] On the heels of our discussion about what is or isn't a scam last week,
[30.76 → 34.60] we'll be talking about an actual scam and how apparently that's legal.
[34.74 → 38.68] Yeah, the LTT screwdriver, by the way, is going to automatically screws in for you.
[39.84 → 42.34] Um, okay, I don't actually...
[42.34 → 44.08] Okay, I get what you're trying to do here,
[44.14 → 46.94] but I don't actually want to make false statements about our products.
[47.40 → 48.70] They will not do that.
[49.94 → 51.02] What your, uh...
[51.62 → 54.20] What your smart glasses might do, though,
[54.20 → 58.88] is docks anyone and everyone who happens to be near you.
[59.12 → 64.56] A couple of students made an invasive DIY facial recognition glasses system
[64.56 → 66.00] that does just that.
[66.38 → 71.88] Um, and we'll be talking about how this could usher in a whole new level of future dystopia.
[72.44 → 73.00] Yay!
[73.34 → 74.42] Do you have any good news?
[74.58 → 75.50] Can you do good news?
[76.06 → 76.40] Uh...
[76.40 → 78.60] Let's see, we got Amazon Dark Patterns, we got...
[78.60 → 79.20] I didn't...
[79.20 → 80.90] Yeah, I was going to say, I didn't have any prepped.
[80.96 → 82.00] Give me good news, good news.
[82.06 → 82.76] Let's go, let's go.
[82.76 → 85.34] Uh, I don't know if that's good news or not.
[85.44 → 86.82] Minority Report is coming.
[87.08 → 87.80] That's not good.
[88.00 → 88.08] Nintendo...
[88.08 → 90.10] I think Burns Returns is actually not good either.
[90.64 → 91.42] Nintendo kills.
[91.44 → 92.24] Nintendo is suing people.
[92.48 → 92.62] Yeah.
[92.74 → 94.04] Riders can't protest anymore.
[94.98 → 96.56] Uh, NVIDIA is doing NVIDIA things.
[97.10 → 98.00] Okay, forget it.
[98.18 → 98.66] Okay.
[100.18 → 101.42] The Negative Show.
[101.94 → 103.18] About bad things.
[103.18 → 123.48] The show is brought to you today by Mans caped Squarespace, 1Password, and of course, our chair
[123.48 → 129.32] partner, Secret Lab, our laptop partner, LG, and our skin partner, Brand.
[129.32 → 130.70] Have you not even looked at the table?
[130.96 → 132.30] Did you not absorb the table yet?
[132.44 → 133.52] Oh, the table's orange.
[133.58 → 135.66] I love how you're able to do this sometimes.
[136.32 → 137.18] Well, I was sponsored.
[137.18 → 138.46] I fully believe that you never noticed it.
[138.46 → 140.06] It was an ad, I couldn't see it.
[141.54 → 142.54] That makes sense.
[142.84 → 143.28] That makes sense.
[143.34 → 144.42] It like glows.
[144.54 → 145.24] It's crazy.
[145.48 → 148.10] It doesn't actually glow, but just because of like the lighting in the room and stuff,
[148.14 → 149.64] it looks like it's almost glowing.
[149.74 → 151.08] Yeah, that totally makes sense.
[151.18 → 151.82] Okay, cool.
[151.94 → 154.72] Well, we'll be talking about that later or not.
[154.80 → 155.24] I don't know.
[155.36 → 155.50] Whatever.
[155.72 → 156.70] The table's orange now.
[156.78 → 156.92] Cool.
[156.92 → 157.10] Maybe not.
[157.32 → 159.46] Let's jump right into our headline topic, shall we?
[159.66 → 159.90] Yeah.
[161.04 → 161.74] Oh, man.
[162.16 → 167.52] A judge has dismissed a shareholder lawsuit that alleged that Tesla had made misleading
[167.52 → 171.02] statements exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving systems.
[171.50 → 177.10] And this is where I feel like I'm about to go off script, and we're about to talk a little
[177.10 → 181.24] bit more about a personal thought that I've had many times.
[182.10 → 184.14] The legal system seems broken, doesn't it?
[184.24 → 184.66] Oh, yeah.
[184.84 → 185.58] It seems broken.
[185.58 → 193.52] It feels like there needs to be like a common sense filter sometimes, you know, where the
[193.52 → 196.72] argument could be, you know, hey, we're Coca-Cola.
[197.14 → 200.18] Yeah, we hired death squads, but it was outside your jurisdiction.
[200.98 → 201.60] So what?
[202.14 → 203.26] What are you going to do about it?
[203.30 → 204.78] That's an actual thing that happened.
[204.78 → 207.08] And so there you go.
[207.16 → 209.20] Their defence literally wasn't that they didn't do it.
[209.20 → 212.44] It was that it's outside your jurisdiction, so you can't charge us for it.
[212.50 → 213.30] That was the defence.
[213.88 → 217.48] And I just, I feel like we need a common sense.
[217.76 → 221.82] Well, something that I genuinely don't understand about this is the whole Red Bull gives you wings
[221.82 → 222.08] thing.
[223.34 → 223.74] Yeah.
[224.22 → 227.26] Like they had to add the like Red Bull doesn't actually give you wings.
[227.32 → 227.54] Yeah.
[227.72 → 229.40] And like, isn't there, there's more of those.
[229.46 → 230.18] It's not just Red Bull.
[230.24 → 231.02] It's like a bunch of different.
[231.26 → 231.38] Yeah.
[231.52 → 234.76] Isn't it like Skittles doesn't actually show a rainbow, and they have to like to clarify.
[234.78 → 237.58] And like McDonald's can't say, have you had your break today?
[237.70 → 242.22] Because nobody gets a break and, you know, not in this economy.
[244.34 → 246.50] Take a break so you could go do gig work.
[246.68 → 247.92] Have you had a break today?
[247.96 → 248.58] Isn't it Kit Kat?
[248.66 → 249.04] No, dude.
[249.14 → 250.40] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[250.78 → 251.42] I don't know.
[252.08 → 252.40] Microsoft.
[253.30 → 253.70] McDonald's.
[253.78 → 253.98] Okay.
[254.02 → 256.30] When I was a child, that was their jingle.
[257.08 → 258.82] Have you had your break today?
[259.30 → 259.60] Huh.
[260.00 → 260.22] Yeah.
[260.88 → 262.00] Don't, don't worry about it.
[262.00 → 264.52] There was never any kind of litigation over that.
[264.60 → 267.86] I was just, I was making a really terrible reference to my childhood.
[267.92 → 268.02] Yeah.
[268.04 → 273.64] But essentially false advertising claims in the past, even ones that are like obvious have
[273.64 → 275.18] usually had to be clarified.
[275.84 → 278.70] However, if they're just supposed to be fun, like the Red Bull thing, they still have to
[278.70 → 278.96] clarify.
[278.96 → 287.08] And it's pretty clear that Tesla has repeatedly, repeatedly, and it's got to be knowingly at
[287.08 → 292.10] this point, misrepresented the capabilities of their autonomous driving feature.
[292.52 → 294.92] And I'm going to use the world's largest finger quotes.
[295.04 → 296.36] Actually, I'm going to need bigger finger quotes.
[297.32 → 297.96] Thank you.
[298.00 → 299.48] Those are much bigger finger quotes than mine.
[299.56 → 300.18] I appreciate that.
[300.34 → 300.54] No problem.
[300.54 → 308.28] Um, however, uh, the judge dismissed the lawsuit and Tesla's lawyers, this is really
[308.28 → 308.78] important.
[309.14 → 313.76] Tesla's lawyers did not defend the claims that they had made on the grounds that they
[313.76 → 314.24] were true.
[314.40 → 314.86] Right?
[314.90 → 319.84] So they, you know, back to the Coca-Cola death squads, they're not defending themselves
[319.84 → 322.70] because we didn't do the thing that was bad.
[323.08 → 324.86] It's more about the loophole.
[324.94 → 326.16] It's about the technicality.
[326.16 → 333.58] Rather, they have claimed that these statements that were not true were merely corporate puffer.
[334.96 → 342.40] The lawyers argued that vague statements of corporate optimism are not objectively verifiable
[342.40 → 347.62] and that no reasonable investor would rely on these statements.
[348.48 → 348.64] Hmm.
[350.88 → 351.52] Hmm.
[352.10 → 353.96] How's Tesla stock doing again?
[353.96 → 356.20] Actually, I think it's been on a tear lately.
[356.66 → 357.72] I don't, don't quote me on that.
[357.78 → 359.64] I don't, I don't keep track of it.
[359.82 → 366.36] Um, the judge having sided with Tesla's lawyers is therefore agreeing that a reasonable person
[366.36 → 372.14] would have seen CEO Elon Musk's statements as obvious bluster and exaggeration.
[375.14 → 377.54] I, um, strongly disagree.
[377.54 → 387.18] I mean, how many times do we have to go through this whole, yeah, next year, next year, next
[387.18 → 391.90] year thing before it becomes pretty clear that it's not coming next year?
[392.98 → 400.86] Um, I mean, do you, it's been, it's been fascinating to watch the recent pivot to the
[400.86 → 405.20] the, the fully autonomous robot taxi project when that's what was promised.
[405.20 → 405.88] Yeah.
[406.02 → 408.00] For each and every Tesla owner.
[408.10 → 410.14] I shouldn't say promised because apparently it was suffered.
[410.62 → 417.90] That's what was suffered for each and every Tesla owner years ago was that their car was going to make them money.
[418.38 → 423.38] Like their car was going to operate as a robot taxi while they were at work making them money.
[423.38 → 425.06] It was like an it was an investment.
[426.06 → 427.52] I found this website.
[427.64 → 429.14] I just found it now.
[429.44 → 431.18] Um, I don't know how perfect it is.
[431.24 → 434.92] I've never looked at this website before, et cetera, but I think it's pretty fantastic.
[434.92 → 437.16] Actually, it's called mother drunker.
[438.62 → 440.12] Um, as in frunk.
[440.28 → 442.54] And it's the full self-driving timeline.
[442.68 → 443.86] I just found this now.
[443.94 → 447.08] So it's different quotes about what the cars will be able to do.
[447.08 → 455.12] You know, uh, are going to end up with complete autonomy and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years from 2015 with the source.
[455.34 → 455.58] Oh yeah.
[455.58 → 457.18] That was not two years ago.
[457.24 → 459.40] You just go all the way down.
[460.34 → 462.90] I really consider autonomous driving a solved problem.
[463.00 → 466.04] I think we are less than two years away from a complete autonomy.
[466.26 → 466.70] 2016.
[469.34 → 470.12] Six months.
[470.46 → 470.90] Definitely.
[471.42 → 473.56] That was back in 2016 as well.
[473.56 → 475.90] You'll be able to fall asleep in a Tesla.
[478.34 → 482.70] Probably be able to deliver Teslas with autonomy in about a year.
[482.84 → 484.04] That's up to the regulators.
[484.30 → 484.44] Yeah.
[484.52 → 485.12] No, it isn't.
[486.72 → 488.22] One of the funniest things I found.
[488.22 → 489.02] Dude, this is wild.
[489.62 → 490.78] This is a cool way of viewing this.
[490.78 → 490.94] Yeah.
[491.04 → 493.44] I can't believe somebody actually compiled all of this.
[493.82 → 495.16] It might even be missing some.
[495.22 → 495.82] I have no idea.
[495.96 → 497.42] Like, I don't, I haven't looked at the site before.
[497.42 → 502.16] The thing that I found most entertaining about this actually is that they gave up at some point.
[502.60 → 502.70] Oh no.
[502.70 → 504.34] They stopped tracking in 2022.
[506.48 → 516.00] I mean, imagine your defence being, if someone like, if someone files a lawsuit calling you a liar who misled them and caused material damage to them.
[516.22 → 519.24] Imagine your defence being, well, obviously I lied.
[519.28 → 520.22] I lie all the time.
[520.22 → 520.32] How would you believe me?
[520.56 → 520.78] Yeah.
[521.12 → 522.94] How could you be stupid enough to believe me?
[522.94 → 525.30] Like, come on.
[525.30 → 530.08] I get that there are a handful of you that are Musk sycophants.
[530.30 → 531.70] And that's cool.
[532.24 → 533.02] You do you.
[533.32 → 539.76] But I stand behind the things that I do not appreciate about his approach to business.
[539.76 → 544.60] And lying about the capabilities of your products and misleading people.
[544.60 → 547.68] That is, that is, that is, that is a scam.
[548.22 → 551.58] And scams are bad, and they are not something to be looked up to.
[552.38 → 565.54] And I just, I don't know how to, I don't know how to have a conversation with someone where we are not grounded in the same basic truth that being a shifty character is not good.
[565.54 → 566.14] Yeah.
[566.28 → 568.82] And that it's not to be applauded or respected.
[569.20 → 569.38] Yeah.
[569.44 → 570.32] It's actually bad.
[570.40 → 582.84] We can appreciate good things that someone accomplished, but we don't have to, we don't have to respect the extremely shady behaviour that they engage in.
[583.64 → 587.72] Um, yeah, cool.
[587.72 → 601.54] So, anyway, I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know how to reconcile this to your point with the other, with the other false advertising precedent that has been set over the years.
[603.50 → 608.44] And like, it's, it's, it's a bit of a, I don't know.
[608.54 → 613.32] It's an interesting line because puffer could make sense.
[613.32 → 617.14] Like, if you're like, oh, this thing is amazing, blah, blah, blah.
[617.22 → 618.32] And it's just okay.
[618.60 → 621.52] Like, that's, that's how I think puffer should be used.
[622.24 → 622.68] Um.
[624.98 → 626.34] Exaggerated or false praise?
[626.70 → 627.72] You know, if, um.
[627.80 → 629.28] Exaggerated, I think, could be okay.
[629.40 → 629.56] Okay.
[629.70 → 630.52] False, I don't think is okay.
[630.52 → 631.54] No, no, false praise.
[631.68 → 636.10] Let me give you a context where false praise could be, could be corporate puffer.
[636.28 → 636.52] Okay.
[636.60 → 640.54] Um, so let's say, um, okay, I'm still CEO.
[641.22 → 641.48] Okay.
[641.66 → 642.94] We're a hypothetical scenario.
[643.14 → 643.28] Okay.
[643.32 → 649.60] I'm up on stage at, uh, at, uh, in the, in the line of Sebastian theatre, you know, whatever.
[649.60 → 656.82] I'm, I'm talking about our, our latest innovation in, um, I don't know, lapel technology or whatever.
[657.06 → 658.32] Colour, colour technology.
[658.42 → 658.60] Sure.
[658.88 → 659.20] Okay.
[659.50 → 661.86] And I'm standing there and.
[661.98 → 662.50] Autopop.
[662.66 → 663.52] I'm, I, uh.
[665.40 → 665.92] Anyway.
[666.08 → 671.64] So I'm, I'm talking about this great, uh, this great long sleeve shirt that's available on the ltdstore.com.
[671.64 → 676.80] Um, and, and our, our chief technical officer or whatever the heck your job is these days.
[676.80 → 677.80] I honestly don't even know.
[677.86 → 678.34] It doesn't matter.
[678.72 → 690.68] Walks up to, walks up to the stage in like a scripted moment, shakes my hand and goes, man, Linus, you look, you are the you look better than in any other outfit I've ever seen.
[690.68 → 694.54] You know, that, that's, that's, that's false.
[694.78 → 695.82] That's false praise.
[696.22 → 699.52] You know, like I think my birthday suit looks a lot better than this personally.
[699.90 → 704.64] And well, yeah, the point is, the point is that that's not.
[704.78 → 705.66] Is that false praise?
[706.34 → 708.08] What if you, what if you actually thought that?
[708.86 → 710.34] But what if you, what if you didn't?
[710.34 → 711.22] It doesn't really matter.
[711.32 → 713.82] This is clearly a scripted, a scripted moment.
[713.82 → 714.32] Unimportant.
[714.50 → 714.64] Yeah.
[714.72 → 721.56] You are, you are engaging with me in a way that could obviously be perceived to be just kind of corporate nonsense.
[721.58 → 725.52] I'm not saying this shirt will have active cooling in two years.
[725.60 → 725.74] Yeah.
[726.16 → 732.04] I, or, or saying something along the lines of like, this is the most innovative shirt we've ever made.
[732.44 → 732.84] Yeah.
[732.88 → 737.76] That's, that's just clearly exaggerated and it's puffy.
[737.76 → 738.78] And it's kind of whatever.
[739.04 → 740.18] And it's non-specific.
[740.42 → 741.12] Doesn't really mean anything.
[741.12 → 743.26] And I think that's, that's one of the problems.
[743.36 → 746.60] And that's where, I mean, I think that's where someone like a Red Bull runs into trouble.
[746.78 → 748.76] They're making a very specific statement.
[749.34 → 756.78] Red Bull gives you wings, which even if you don't interpret it literally, you could interpret to mean that it makes you move faster, potentially.
[757.40 → 757.62] Right?
[757.72 → 759.62] And it is an energy beverage.
[759.98 → 763.80] And so maybe, yeah, potentially there's methamphetamine in it.
[763.84 → 764.38] I don't know.
[764.84 → 766.26] You won't slow down.
[766.26 → 769.20] Like you could actually misinterpret that.
[769.80 → 771.86] But that's the thing with the self-driving.
[772.50 → 775.14] It's not, these are not vague statements.
[775.40 → 777.64] Our self-driving technology is world leading.
[778.22 → 779.14] That's puffy.
[779.28 → 780.40] That's non-verifiable.
[780.90 → 782.54] That's, it's, it's non-objective.
[782.86 → 783.48] But saying.
[783.64 → 785.26] Go back to the go back to the thing for a sec.
[785.40 → 786.76] Oh, well, I, I left it.
[786.78 → 787.34] So give me a sec.
[787.42 → 787.72] I got to find it.
[787.72 → 788.10] Yeah, sure.
[791.62 → 792.86] This is specific.
[796.26 → 800.28] Go, go to some of the newer stuff because the newer stuff ends up being a little, oh my goodness.
[800.68 → 802.04] The newer stuff ends up being a bit more.
[802.10 → 802.94] Anyway, the point is.
[803.00 → 803.32] What is that?
[803.40 → 803.84] Why can't I?
[803.92 → 805.30] It's a solved problem.
[805.78 → 808.08] Is a very specific statement.
[808.08 → 813.40] That doesn't, that doesn't mean, you know, we're really confident.
[813.74 → 816.16] Our world-class team can solve this problem.
[816.24 → 817.62] That's, that's puffer.
[817.94 → 821.62] You know, you're, you're talking up the capabilities of your team.
[821.72 → 831.72] You're, you're, you're engaging in the kind of thing that, if you said anything other than that, could be like, um, you know, could be potentially seen as like bullying.
[831.72 → 838.84] Like if you were to say anything other than I have complete faith in my team to deliver on, on this amazing new technology.
[839.06 → 844.24] Like if you're like, say that on a stage, I mean, that would be, that would be terrible.
[844.32 → 845.18] The optics would be terrible.
[845.26 → 847.98] So I can see corporate puffer is something that you have to say.
[847.98 → 857.22] You essentially have to say that you, you believe in your plan and that the team is engaged in moving forward with it.
[857.42 → 863.18] You don't have to say, um, let's see.
[863.82 → 867.88] It will be capable of level five autonomy by the end of this year.
[868.80 → 870.76] That is extremely specific.
[871.22 → 872.42] That's not puffer.
[872.68 → 874.46] That's just a lie.
[874.46 → 880.30] And not only are you saying that, but you're saying it already has the, the hardware capability.
[880.30 → 885.32] Like we can, we can remotely deliver this feature to you in the thing that you already own.
[885.32 → 888.16] If you buy it today, like that, that type of stuff, you know,
[888.28 → 892.30] Corey is the name says, can you think of any examples in which LCT has engaged in corporate puffer?
[892.86 → 893.62] Um, yeah.
[894.20 → 894.64] Yeah.
[894.76 → 895.92] I look at the store.
[895.92 → 903.64] I think that, um, there have been cases where we've had, um,
[903.64 → 907.80] Oh man, nothing, nothing product specific.
[907.80 → 915.38] I don't think, but like we've, I've definitely said things that are, that are not necessarily true to the best of my knowledge.
[915.38 → 921.10] Like particularly around someone like a like an ex employee, I would always talk up what they've done really well.
[921.54 → 924.42] I would never talk about why we parted ways.
[925.08 → 927.66] Um, whether it was, was good or bad really.
[927.66 → 933.74] Yeah. So in that case, it was more, it's more down to, uh, you know, confidentiality and professionalism.
[933.82 → 935.70] It's less puffer. It's not really marketing though.
[936.00 → 940.62] Okay. So hold on. Have we ever, have we ever puffer in our marketing?
[942.64 → 947.74] Um, you know what? I'm going to, I'm going to throw this back to you guys.
[948.10 → 949.52] I'm going to throw this back to you guys.
[949.52 → 959.62] No, I don't think trust me, bro would count as puffer. I think we have in good faith taken the best possible care of anyone who's had a problem with our products.
[959.88 → 964.78] Um, it's not always been the most timely. We're a small team. Our customer support is on shore.
[965.38 → 973.10] Um, you know, so we don't operate around the clock. You know, sometimes in particular when we have a long weekend or something, I'm sorry that our team gets long weekends.
[973.38 → 974.90] Are videos a product?
[974.90 → 979.44] Uh, yeah, I think our, I think videos are our product.
[979.68 → 980.08] Thumbnails.
[981.08 → 985.12] Is that puffer though? Cause the puffer here, what's puffer?
[986.18 → 991.08] Exaggerated or false praise though. It's not, it's not, it's praise specifically.
[991.88 → 994.80] How is saying it will have full self-driving praise then?
[995.48 → 999.16] Well, it's not, it's not puffer. That's the whole, that's the whole thing I'm mad about.
[999.34 → 1001.04] Is that's not puffer at all.
[1001.04 → 1007.16] That's a specific statement about the capability of the product that could absolutely mislead an investor or a customer.
[1007.44 → 1010.80] Okay. Someone in Float play chat, I think got it. Um, oh, there's two of them.
[1010.88 → 1016.72] Yeah. They hit me on the world-class thing. I knew that was coming. I knew world-class was coming. Furthermore, I didn't want to address it.
[1017.40 → 1023.78] I will often, in fact, internally, the way that I'll refer to our team as world-class is a bit of a meme.
[1023.78 → 1029.62] We have a world-class team in a literal sense. I don't actually think it's puffer.
[1029.90 → 1036.98] We compete with the best in the world in the tech media space, tech entertainment, tech education.
[1037.70 → 1043.40] We, we, we are very, very competitive around the world. We are a world-class team.
[1043.40 → 1058.60] We have a global reach for our brand and for our content. We are a world-class team. However, a lot of the time, um, I use world-class and, and we use world-class team in a verbally ironic manner internally.
[1058.60 → 1063.22] So, you know, someone will leave the bathroom in a deplorable state.
[1063.22 → 1065.62] I was gonna, I was going to give the exact same example.
[1065.70 → 1071.38] Pee all over the seat. Pee all over the floor. What looks like it could be peed in the sink.
[1071.72 → 1072.36] World-class.
[1072.48 → 1078.06] And, and the first thing that people will start talking about on Teams is world-class.
[1079.40 → 1081.12] Um, yeah.
[1081.60 → 1088.48] So, uh, I don't think that's puffer though. I think, I think, I think, okay.
[1088.60 → 1089.26] Yes, it can.
[1089.26 → 1089.94] It is a little bit.
[1090.08 → 1097.90] Yes, it can be. But verbal irony is also not puffer. In order to be puffer, it has to be seen as an earnest statement.
[1098.06 → 1100.64] This, this is where like the lines get so blurry.
[1100.64 → 1101.60] They do get blurry.
[1101.68 → 1102.56] They get so blurry.
[1102.60 → 1103.46] They do get blurry.
[1103.46 → 1108.02] Someone also pointed out world-class employees don't have time to aim.
[1109.98 → 1111.46] Sorry, that was hilarious.
[1114.06 → 1116.12] They're busy making world-class videos.
[1116.12 → 1121.70] Another, another one that was brought up by somebody was, um, uh, we have a great show for you today.
[1121.88 → 1123.58] A bunch of people have brought that one up.
[1123.64 → 1124.02] Okay.
[1124.18 → 1124.98] Intruding Wayne show.
[1125.12 → 1125.42] Okay.
[1125.42 → 1125.96] Great show for you.
[1125.96 → 1126.22] Yeah.
[1126.28 → 1127.28] We say it like every time.
[1127.68 → 1127.94] Yeah.
[1128.00 → 1130.34] I think that is an example of puffer.
[1130.88 → 1131.12] Yeah.
[1131.12 → 1133.78] Sometimes the show is going to be s*** and we know it.
[1134.12 → 1134.52] Yeah.
[1135.88 → 1139.86] But like, it's not good salesmanship to say, yeah, we got nothing this week.
[1140.28 → 1141.10] We've done it.
[1141.64 → 1143.54] Which we, you're not wrong.
[1144.38 → 1147.24] Actually, I've actually, I've found that some of those shows have been pretty good.
[1147.32 → 1148.54] Sometimes they're, they're, yeah.
[1148.70 → 1148.86] Yeah.
[1148.90 → 1149.58] You never know.
[1149.64 → 1154.68] It has less to do with the topics, and it has more to do with like how much sleep either of us has had.
[1154.68 → 1158.04] And there's a, there's like, there's a Goldilocks zone.
[1159.92 → 1165.88] Because if we've had, if we've had absolutely none, it's like, all right, getting on to our next topic.
[1166.30 → 1166.52] Yeah.
[1166.56 → 1168.12] I'm mad about that.
[1169.38 → 1170.44] But if we're like.
[1170.92 → 1171.18] Yeah.
[1171.32 → 1176.06] But, but then, but then like if we're really well rested, everything is pretty sane.
[1176.26 → 1176.54] Yeah.
[1177.02 → 1178.10] Um, so there's this like.
[1178.14 → 1179.48] You need a little bit of derangement.
[1179.48 → 1179.74] Yeah.
[1179.78 → 1184.04] There's this magic zone where it's like, we're not really running on quite enough sleep.
[1184.04 → 1185.40] And neither of us caffeinated.
[1185.62 → 1187.62] So we just start to get a little loopy.
[1188.96 → 1191.84] I feel like the Japan show was like definitely one of those.
[1192.02 → 1193.40] Oh, a hundred percent.
[1193.72 → 1196.92] With our camera operator passed out behind the lens.
[1197.18 → 1197.44] Yeah.
[1198.36 → 1199.62] I was worried about him.
[1199.80 → 1200.34] Yeah, me too.
[1201.04 → 1201.66] He's a tank.
[1203.02 → 1203.26] Yeah.
[1203.50 → 1203.74] Yeah.
[1204.22 → 1204.66] Um.
[1205.76 → 1206.20] Okay.
[1206.20 → 1211.82] So you guys have definitely, definitely caught us on a couple of, on a couple of, on a couple
[1211.82 → 1216.58] of Jefferies, but I think when it comes to our products, I know, I don't think we puffer.
[1218.80 → 1221.10] I feel like there's, there's got to be some thumbnails.
[1221.40 → 1221.74] Dude.
[1222.20 → 1222.60] Thumbnails.
[1222.74 → 1224.58] I don't think thumbnails are puffer though.
[1224.80 → 1228.64] You don't, you can't, you don't exaggerate the what would it?
[1228.66 → 1228.94] Praise?
[1228.94 → 1229.42] You sure might.
[1229.88 → 1231.82] You don't falsely praise or exaggerate.
[1232.50 → 1232.70] You might.
[1232.92 → 1234.36] The praise the video.
[1234.36 → 1236.80] That's the best computer we've ever made.
[1237.40 → 1237.92] I'm looking.
[1238.02 → 1238.66] I'm not there yet.
[1238.80 → 1239.74] Why did I look up YouTube?
[1239.74 → 1240.72] What are you even doing?
[1241.02 → 1241.98] Do you even compute?
[1242.84 → 1244.08] By the way, that's a great video.
[1244.16 → 1244.48] Go back.
[1244.96 → 1245.40] Uh.
[1247.02 → 1248.96] Do you not even, do you not even alt left arrow?
[1249.06 → 1250.18] What is, what is your problem?
[1250.58 → 1252.08] Uh, there, there, down left.
[1252.70 → 1253.40] That's freaking awesome.
[1253.48 → 1254.04] I watched it.
[1254.04 → 1254.54] Oh, yeah.
[1254.62 → 1254.74] Yeah.
[1254.82 → 1255.64] Canuck creator.
[1255.98 → 1258.12] Uh, just like casually showed up at the studio.
[1258.38 → 1263.06] Tynan did a great job just showing him some of our, uh, some of our prototyping tools that
[1263.06 → 1263.48] we use.
[1263.48 → 1267.38] It's, uh, there's this sort of perception, um, every once in a while when we actually
[1267.38 → 1270.42] do a video in the workshop, um, you'll see the odd comment.
[1270.42 → 1272.88] That's like, man, they spent so much money on this workshop.
[1272.88 → 1273.60] They never use it.
[1273.70 → 1275.48] They don't, people don't know what we use it for.
[1275.66 → 1279.28] And I think part of that's on us because we don't really talk about what we use it for.
[1279.28 → 1281.72] I've been saying for a long time, we should do engineering video.
[1281.86 → 1285.60] I think we should have a YouTube channel that has no upload cadence.
[1285.92 → 1292.06] We commit to no uploads, but it's LMG or whatever you want to call it.
[1292.06 → 1293.80] Umbrella parent company engineering.
[1294.16 → 1294.60] Interesting.
[1294.66 → 1299.10] And we just show like, like the, the, the oversized screwdrivers show how we made those.
[1299.10 → 1303.02] The, the like metal screwdrivers, the carbon fibre one, the wooden one, all these different
[1303.02 → 1304.34] cool experiment things that we do.
[1304.52 → 1307.50] We do tons of cool engineering stuff, and we tell no one about it.
[1307.50 → 1314.36] And there are entire massive YouTubers and entire massive fields of YouTube that are entirely
[1314.36 → 1315.82] based around just that.
[1315.82 → 1319.88] And we do it, and we're a content creation company, and we don't show anyone.
[1319.88 → 1321.30] And it drives me nuts.
[1321.44 → 1322.60] You're actually not wrong.
[1322.76 → 1328.14] And we could like, I understand the pressure that the engineering teams don't want to have
[1328.14 → 1329.96] of needing to churn out content.
[1330.14 → 1332.48] And so just don't make required uploads for it.
[1332.48 → 1335.34] But making a video makes everything take three times longer.
[1335.58 → 1338.74] And most of what they use this stuff for is product development.
[1338.98 → 1339.04] Yeah.
[1339.22 → 1340.74] Which would sell products.
[1340.90 → 1341.58] I know.
[1341.76 → 1342.28] I know.
[1342.34 → 1343.88] But it would take three times longer.
[1343.96 → 1345.14] Look, look, look.
[1345.46 → 1345.66] Okay.
[1345.80 → 1346.22] Look.
[1346.98 → 1348.84] Artie is on the CW team now.
[1349.06 → 1349.76] I think that was.
[1349.76 → 1357.68] He is hard at work on content around our, in fact, in fact, he actually shot a video earlier
[1357.68 → 1358.56] this week.
[1358.80 → 1359.82] Or wait, was it Artie who shot?
[1359.84 → 1360.92] I think it was Artie who shot it.
[1361.60 → 1362.76] It was either Artie or Sammy.
[1363.54 → 1365.66] They had a camera in front of their face the whole time.
[1365.72 → 1367.34] And I'm pretty sure it was Artie anyway.
[1367.34 → 1376.40] Anyway, he actually shot a video of our meeting about the development of the Zuck t-shirt.
[1377.18 → 1382.38] So as part of our development of a gray shirt, right?
[1382.44 → 1388.62] Because we wanted, kind of like the Steve mock neck, we want to do a Zuck t-shirt.
[1388.84 → 1392.78] I'd love to do a Jensen leather jacket as well, but that's going to be a much bigger project.
[1392.92 → 1393.90] I don't know how many we'd sell.
[1394.06 → 1394.62] It's a whole thing.
[1394.62 → 1397.50] Anyway, the point is we want to do a Zuck t-shirt, the Zuck.
[1398.02 → 1403.90] And as part of our development process, we kind of went, well, shoot, we don't know what's
[1403.90 → 1405.08] the shirt he wears.
[1405.18 → 1406.62] We don't know what's special about it.
[1406.62 → 1407.16] We don't know.
[1407.28 → 1409.16] We don't know what t-shirt a billionaire wears.
[1410.10 → 1410.88] Apparently this is it.
[1411.00 → 1412.18] We answered that question.
[1412.50 → 1413.64] This is the packaging.
[1413.92 → 1414.72] What is the?
[1415.08 → 1417.88] That a t-shirt a billionaire wears comes in.
[1418.20 → 1419.34] That name sounds expensive.
[1419.58 → 1420.86] Brunello Cucinelli.
[1421.38 → 1421.58] Yeah.
[1421.58 → 1423.30] We'll be unboxing it later on the show.
[1423.30 → 1425.76] We'll be destroying it later on the show.
[1425.82 → 1426.02] Yeah.
[1426.16 → 1429.78] Because that's part of the product development process.
[1429.94 → 1431.52] We'll explain what that little machine is.
[1431.82 → 1437.60] Anyway, the point is I believe it was Artie actually shot a video of us having the conversation,
[1438.18 → 1442.84] evaluating this shirt compared to our existing blanks, compared to our existing cotton blanks,
[1443.04 → 1445.52] sort of talking about what's good about it, what's not as good about it.
[1445.64 → 1446.36] It was pretty cool.
[1446.76 → 1447.40] It was pretty cool.
[1447.40 → 1449.24] And so we're trying to do more of that, okay?
[1449.38 → 1450.54] We're trying to do more.
[1451.34 → 1454.28] But anyway, Canuck Creator did a great job.
[1454.76 → 1455.78] Tynan did a great job.
[1455.88 → 1462.54] It's a really cool little tour, and it gives you a better idea of what exactly it is that we're doing with all of this really cool fabrication stuff.
[1462.60 → 1463.78] Anyway, so yeah.
[1464.20 → 1465.08] False advertising.
[1465.26 → 1465.58] Let's go.
[1465.74 → 1466.20] Or puffer.
[1466.30 → 1466.62] Puffer.
[1466.62 → 1467.18] Puffer, yeah.
[1467.98 → 1469.84] Exaggerated or false praise.
[1470.52 → 1473.24] Okay, so actually giving you a headache, but that's not praise.
[1473.24 → 1473.50] It did.
[1474.02 → 1475.20] I literally got a headache.
[1475.34 → 1476.10] Oh my.
[1476.38 → 1477.72] I'm not too surprised.
[1478.66 → 1479.10] Yeah.
[1480.10 → 1482.16] Part of it is that I forgot to drink water that day.
[1482.46 → 1483.68] I always get a headache one.
[1483.70 → 1484.26] It has to be praised.
[1484.34 → 1484.60] Yeah.
[1486.76 → 1487.76] Dude, no.
[1488.16 → 1488.84] It's perfect?
[1489.58 → 1490.36] It's perfect.
[1490.48 → 1491.16] It's unusable.
[1491.50 → 1492.40] But it's perfect.
[1492.88 → 1496.16] Yeah, but both of those are true.
[1496.22 → 1498.70] I think together, you can't say that's puffer.
[1498.70 → 1502.64] I mean, look, if Tesla was like, our autopilot is perfect.
[1502.82 → 1503.94] It's unusable.
[1504.48 → 1506.52] That would at least raise questions.
[1507.20 → 1508.40] Yeah, yeah.
[1508.48 → 1512.34] That would give them plausible deniability about the perfect statement.
[1513.18 → 1513.94] All right.
[1518.68 → 1520.60] Last PC building guide you'll ever need?
[1521.08 → 1521.88] That's not puffer.
[1522.30 → 1523.98] If that's actually just true.
[1524.02 → 1525.12] That is a factual statement.
[1525.12 → 1528.14] The first one got like 11 or 12 million views.
[1528.22 → 1531.24] And the comments are just full of like, I just built my PC using this guide.
[1531.50 → 1532.84] I built the PC that can't fail.
[1533.38 → 1533.74] Yeah.
[1534.24 → 1534.58] Yeah.
[1534.64 → 1540.16] So it's a high availability PC cluster.
[1540.98 → 1542.18] But it can't fail?
[1542.36 → 1543.12] It can't.
[1544.30 → 1544.94] Can't fail.
[1546.40 → 1547.30] Everything can fail.
[1547.30 → 1548.64] I mean, okay.
[1548.82 → 1549.48] Is it waterproof?
[1549.74 → 1550.00] All right.
[1550.04 → 1551.70] That is a slight exaggeration.
[1551.84 → 1552.06] All right.
[1552.08 → 1552.54] You know what?
[1552.66 → 1553.18] You know what?
[1554.52 → 1555.26] You've got me.
[1555.44 → 1558.12] It took a lot longer than I thought.
[1558.42 → 1559.72] We had to go back months.
[1559.92 → 1561.10] I thought it was going to be pretty quick.
[1561.16 → 1563.80] But the praise part makes it difficult.
[1563.96 → 1564.16] Yeah.
[1564.16 → 1566.90] Which I still don't understand.
[1567.42 → 1567.52] Yeah.
[1567.52 → 1568.16] Because it wasn't.
[1569.34 → 1571.12] The Elon statements weren't praise.
[1571.34 → 1571.48] No.
[1571.54 → 1573.60] They were just, here's what we're going to do.
[1573.66 → 1574.22] This is the plan.
[1574.26 → 1575.82] It will have this feature on this timeline.
[1575.82 → 1580.12] And if you can't believe the CEO of a company about the product roadmap, then who can you believe?
[1580.54 → 1580.92] And I can.
[1581.02 → 1585.00] Well, I don't think you can ever believe anyone about any product timeline.
[1585.52 → 1587.06] Because no one actually knows.
[1587.06 → 1594.86] But like, I think there's also got to be some amount of a limit to things.
[1596.22 → 1596.86] All right.
[1597.32 → 1598.20] Why don't we move on?
[1598.42 → 1599.20] Because I'm bored.
[1600.34 → 1602.40] Oh, hey, we've got Riley here.
[1603.20 → 1604.10] I forget.
[1604.62 → 1605.86] Speaking of puffer.
[1605.94 → 1606.86] I totally forgot.
[1607.00 → 1608.00] I'm so sorry, Riley.
[1608.22 → 1611.50] I came to puff up something of my own.
[1612.18 → 1612.90] Check it out.
[1612.98 → 1613.98] Check us out, guys.
[1614.26 → 1615.52] What is this again?
[1615.60 → 1615.90] I forget.
[1615.90 → 1618.02] We're Jake, Jake, Jake.
[1618.16 → 1618.76] And Jake.
[1619.04 → 1619.96] Attorneys at law.
[1620.06 → 1620.68] Thank you.
[1621.78 → 1623.46] Am I yelling into this thing?
[1623.70 → 1624.44] Do I hold it like this?
[1624.50 → 1624.86] I forget.
[1625.28 → 1626.12] It's end address.
[1626.40 → 1626.54] Yeah.
[1626.64 → 1627.16] Yeah, you're good.
[1629.14 → 1637.44] Dan said he could give me a chair, but I decided to just come squat in here awkwardly because that's more of a style.
[1637.80 → 1639.62] It is truly awkward.
[1639.82 → 1640.22] Forgot.
[1640.40 → 1641.08] I like it, though.
[1641.28 → 1642.36] Do we have an apple box?
[1642.44 → 1643.92] This light is really bright.
[1644.64 → 1645.70] Yeah, don't look at that.
[1645.70 → 1646.44] It's not fake.
[1646.66 → 1647.48] It's too late.
[1647.70 → 1648.22] Riley, can I?
[1648.28 → 1648.94] No, Riley.
[1649.50 → 1652.82] Linus, did you know that it was Riley week on float plane this week?
[1653.00 → 1655.44] I did know that it was Riley week on float plane this week.
[1655.44 → 1657.28] Did you know that I did a backflip for you?
[1657.70 → 1660.52] I know that you cannot do a backflip.
[1660.88 → 1661.24] Whoa.
[1661.48 → 1662.34] You don't know that.
[1662.38 → 1663.12] I do know that.
[1663.58 → 1664.50] That's anti-puffer.
[1665.06 → 1665.86] That's puffer.
[1665.86 → 1670.20] I watched the Star Wars video.
[1670.20 → 1670.66] It was perfect.
[1670.72 → 1671.20] I really liked it.
[1671.22 → 1672.04] Did you watch the whole thing?
[1672.16 → 1672.32] I did.
[1672.32 → 1673.22] I heard you were watching it.
[1673.24 → 1673.86] It's fantastic.
[1673.94 → 1674.48] Who said that?
[1675.02 → 1676.18] I think Sammy told me.
[1676.28 → 1676.82] I liked it.
[1676.94 → 1677.54] I liked it a lot.
[1678.18 → 1680.04] Well, I thought it was okay.
[1680.82 → 1682.84] Sammy told me that it took 10 million years to edit.
[1682.84 → 1685.60] That's not a puffer.
[1685.80 → 1686.68] It took a long time.
[1686.76 → 1687.70] Because it wasn't praise.
[1688.62 → 1689.20] Yeah, yeah.
[1689.36 → 1690.80] No, it took a long time.
[1691.02 → 1692.88] It took, I'm not going to lie.
[1693.06 → 1697.70] I stayed up all night, a couple nights, to get the script done and to do the guidance.
[1697.82 → 1698.32] You didn't.
[1698.50 → 1698.80] Shh.
[1699.68 → 1700.04] Shh.
[1700.26 → 1701.10] Did you really?
[1701.22 → 1701.56] Shh, Linus.
[1701.76 → 1702.04] Shh.
[1702.70 → 1704.30] I won't go all the way because I don't know.
[1704.44 → 1705.32] I don't know where your mouth is.
[1706.68 → 1708.36] You've been puffing up a lot of things, so.
[1708.48 → 1708.72] Oh.
[1709.76 → 1710.54] Oh, wow.
[1711.22 → 1712.34] This is WAN Show.
[1712.34 → 1713.70] We got to keep it appropriate.
[1714.16 → 1717.98] Listen, Riley Week is over now.
[1718.32 → 1719.50] There were three videos, right?
[1719.74 → 1719.94] Yeah.
[1720.42 → 1722.90] Did you guys watch any of them except the Star Wars?
[1723.02 → 1723.78] I watched Star Wars.
[1723.86 → 1724.84] I didn't watch any of them yet.
[1724.92 → 1725.34] It's okay.
[1725.64 → 1725.96] Okay.
[1726.18 → 1726.62] It's okay.
[1726.74 → 1728.84] I mean, on the Q&A, you probably just know all of them.
[1728.84 → 1732.52] Yeah, if I want to talk to Riley, I just talk to Riley because he's right there.
[1733.52 → 1735.28] We match almost every day.
[1735.36 → 1736.86] I was waiting for the Star Wars one.
[1737.56 → 1738.12] So was I.
[1738.20 → 1739.24] I was excited about it.
[1739.24 → 1745.28] I don't know what else to say other than go subscribe to Flow plane, which you guys already
[1745.28 → 1746.58] say like five times an episode.
[1746.76 → 1748.14] So I just kind of want to hang out here.
[1748.80 → 1749.22] This is.
[1749.96 → 1750.32] Okay.
[1750.66 → 1751.40] This is quite a nickel.
[1751.46 → 1752.52] What is this segment?
[1752.66 → 1753.52] Shadow puppets.
[1753.52 → 1756.98] Is this just marketing for Flow plane?
[1757.06 → 1757.80] Is that the whole point?
[1757.86 → 1758.00] Yeah.
[1758.04 → 1761.84] If you could just keep switching back and forth to Flow plane there, that would be pretty cool.
[1762.48 → 1762.80] Okay.
[1763.00 → 1763.38] So yeah.
[1764.38 → 1766.88] Riley Week among our other exclusives.
[1766.88 → 1769.18] Why do you guys ever use the space back here?
[1769.26 → 1769.70] There's a lot.
[1769.78 → 1770.46] You could do some.
[1770.82 → 1771.62] You could do some activities.
[1771.62 → 1772.76] The lights have to go.
[1772.84 → 1773.92] We got like talk linked.
[1773.92 → 1777.84] And we don't have a mic that's on a, you know, freely moving.
[1778.18 → 1778.44] I know.
[1778.54 → 1781.88] I thought that this was going to be more of a handheld thing, but this like, this feels
[1781.88 → 1782.92] wrong.
[1783.02 → 1783.68] It's two hands.
[1784.24 → 1785.24] It's a two handed?
[1785.34 → 1785.48] Yeah.
[1785.52 → 1785.86] There you go.
[1786.08 → 1787.20] It's a spy handed.
[1787.48 → 1788.22] She via handed.
[1788.58 → 1790.24] I don't think anyone took it that way, but yeah.
[1790.38 → 1790.96] Yeah, definitely.
[1791.36 → 1791.76] For sure.
[1791.86 → 1792.24] It's a weapon.
[1792.28 → 1793.46] Knocking it out of the park, Riley.
[1794.42 → 1795.38] What's your next topic?
[1796.80 → 1797.82] I don't know.
[1797.98 → 1799.66] Are you joining us for the show?
[1799.66 → 1800.54] Do you want like a stool?
[1800.74 → 1803.44] Students make invasive DIY facial recognition glasses.
[1803.44 → 1804.34] Oh man.
[1804.62 → 1804.94] Yeah.
[1805.24 → 1807.16] That, that's pretty scary.
[1807.44 → 1807.70] Yeah.
[1807.92 → 1809.88] We talked about that on Tech Linked this week.
[1810.06 → 1810.56] Oh yeah.
[1811.28 → 1811.76] Do you, what?
[1811.82 → 1812.56] Do you want me to go?
[1813.16 → 1814.46] I don't know what we're doing.
[1814.48 → 1815.92] Are you joining us for part of the show?
[1815.92 → 1820.60] Like Connor's waiting for me to go review Tech Linked right now, but like, I can wait.
[1820.80 → 1821.96] Do you want to do this topic with us?
[1822.12 → 1823.20] No, I'm not going to do this.
[1823.20 → 1823.84] Do you want to read the topic?
[1823.84 → 1824.48] Here, read the topic.
[1827.96 → 1828.32] Really?
[1828.74 → 1828.96] Yeah.
[1829.74 → 1831.76] Students make, I'm not going to read the whole topic.
[1831.78 → 1832.20] Read the topic.
[1832.20 → 1834.94] Make invasive DIY facial recognition glasses.
[1835.06 → 1836.08] I'm going to summarize it.
[1836.12 → 1836.46] Okay.
[1838.06 → 1839.82] Because we reported on this on Tech Linked.
[1840.46 → 1842.14] Some students from Harvard.
[1842.68 → 1843.18] Okay, fine.
[1843.20 → 1843.62] I'll just read it.
[1843.62 → 1848.50] Two Harvard students set up a system that uses a video feed from their meta smart glasses
[1848.50 → 1855.56] to automatically scan the faces of strangers, identify them, and compile dossiers of personal
[1855.56 → 1859.76] information such as jobs, personal associations, phone numbers, and addresses.
[1860.42 → 1864.70] While the system made the occasional error, notably it once flagged a young woman as her
[1864.70 → 1865.78] identical twin.
[1866.00 → 1866.28] Oops.
[1866.52 → 1866.92] Broken.
[1867.18 → 1867.56] Awkward.
[1867.62 → 1868.14] Throw it out.
[1868.14 → 1872.26] The students were able to use this system to approach several strangers and greet them
[1872.26 → 1876.24] by name while pretending to be an acquaintance or a fan of their work.
[1876.48 → 1877.76] How creepy would that be?
[1879.14 → 1880.24] I mean, it's happened.
[1880.90 → 1883.18] I found LA is actually the worst for that.
[1883.22 → 1883.78] And this is what's funny.
[1883.88 → 1887.78] It's like, it's like, hey, you want to feel what it's like to be famous for a second?
[1887.78 → 1892.18] Or to be an upper-mid-tier YouTube celebrity?
[1896.30 → 1900.76] The students have published a paper detailing their experiment, which they say was intended
[1900.76 → 1904.90] as a demonstration of what is already possible with current technology.
[1905.44 → 1909.18] Tech giants like Google and Meta have considered putting facial recognition into smart glasses
[1909.18 → 1911.96] in the past, and they have.
[1911.96 → 1918.12] Google has dismissed the idea due to safety and legal concerns after making a product
[1918.12 → 1918.50] already.
[1918.84 → 1919.38] But that's here.
[1920.00 → 1922.54] Whereas Meta's reasons for not pursuing it are unclear.
[1923.18 → 1927.40] Meta has not yet committed to not using the footage or images from their smart glasses
[1927.40 → 1929.98] for use in data scraping or AI training.
[1930.14 → 1932.50] I mean, that's all screwed.
[1932.98 → 1933.98] They've absolutely...
[1933.98 → 1934.58] Thank you, Riley.
[1934.68 → 1935.42] That is the summary.
[1935.62 → 1939.08] No, as in the whole, like, oh, don't use it for AI training.
[1939.22 → 1941.32] Everything is being used for AI training already.
[1941.32 → 1943.50] Yeah, and they've essentially actually said the opposite.
[1943.66 → 1949.46] Zuckerberg on a podcast, Thingamajig, said that he wants you to have personal AIs that
[1949.46 → 1953.44] are powered by things like the glasses so that they have context of everything in your life.
[1953.52 → 1953.86] Yeah.
[1954.26 → 1956.74] But, like, that's one thing because it's your personal AI.
[1957.42 → 1962.54] I think a lot of people are probably okay with you feeding, if it's encrypted and everything.
[1962.84 → 1963.08] Oh, yeah.
[1963.26 → 1967.40] If you, like, you feed your data into a personal AI and no one ever gets it except you.
[1967.54 → 1968.24] Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[1968.24 → 1971.26] I feel like the lighting on my face is perfect for this story.
[1971.36 → 1972.20] It's, like, dystopian.
[1972.34 → 1973.24] Yeah, it kind of is.
[1973.32 → 1975.00] It's like, I am your personal AI.
[1975.08 → 1975.76] Your two-face.
[1978.26 → 1979.46] I mean, okay.
[1980.32 → 1981.24] What else do we have to say?
[1981.32 → 1983.34] I feel like this was actually a good topic.
[1983.46 → 1986.30] You guys should continue discussing it, but I have to go review Tech Link.
[1986.48 → 1986.80] Okay.
[1987.22 → 1987.54] Okay.
[1987.78 → 1988.14] Thank you, Riley.
[1988.14 → 1988.92] I really have to go.
[1989.04 → 1989.78] I can't stay.
[1989.82 → 1990.78] We could bring you a laptop.
[1990.96 → 1992.10] You could just do it behind the set.
[1992.76 → 1993.20] What's that?
[1993.30 → 1994.48] Do you want to just have a laptop?
[1994.64 → 1995.14] You could do it there.
[1995.54 → 1996.66] You could review it on-
[1996.66 → 1998.72] Yeah, you just hide behind the laptops.
[1998.90 → 2002.74] I think next show I'll come back, and I'll be back here and you guys probably won't know
[2002.74 → 2003.70] until I say something.
[2003.88 → 2004.16] Okay.
[2004.32 → 2004.88] Nice workplace.
[2005.02 → 2005.62] Thanks, Riley.
[2005.76 → 2006.32] Thank you, Riley.
[2006.42 → 2006.70] Love you.
[2006.86 → 2007.84] Subscribe to Flow plane.
[2007.98 → 2008.26] Yeah.
[2008.42 → 2008.66] All right.
[2008.68 → 2009.70] My favourite website.
[2010.28 → 2011.08] Thank you, Riley.
[2011.66 → 2012.02] Puffer.
[2012.02 → 2013.10] There's some puffer right there.
[2013.10 → 2013.32] Yeah.
[2015.04 → 2015.72] I enjoy-
[2015.72 → 2018.34] You guys can't see this, but he's bear crawling off the set.
[2018.68 → 2018.88] What?
[2018.88 → 2021.04] I'm leaving with dignity.
[2022.28 → 2023.20] Oh, man.
[2023.66 → 2024.82] That was fantastic.
[2024.88 → 2025.22] Wow.
[2025.38 → 2025.72] Okay.
[2025.86 → 2027.04] Thank you very much, Riley.
[2027.18 → 2027.94] That was great.
[2028.04 → 2028.38] That was.
[2028.44 → 2031.58] You never know what's going to happen when Riley walks into the room.
[2031.82 → 2031.92] Yeah.
[2032.58 → 2036.10] But that actually was a perfect example of puffer.
[2036.92 → 2037.16] Yeah.
[2037.94 → 2039.26] It's my favourite website.
[2039.26 → 2040.08] Which is fine.
[2040.20 → 2041.30] Which is fine.
[2041.52 → 2043.44] There's a near zero percent chance that's true.
[2043.68 → 2043.92] Yeah.
[2044.16 → 2044.52] Exactly.
[2044.56 → 2045.32] But who cares?
[2045.42 → 2046.10] But that's obvious.
[2046.38 → 2046.54] Yeah.
[2046.72 → 2047.52] And that's the thing.
[2047.62 → 2048.78] Puffer should be obvious.
[2048.78 → 2049.52] And it doesn't matter.
[2049.64 → 2049.78] Yeah.
[2049.84 → 2050.20] All right.
[2050.36 → 2051.96] So let's come back to these smart glasses.
[2052.26 → 2052.30] Yeah.
[2052.42 → 2054.08] This is-
[2054.08 → 2058.64] What's funny about this topic to me is that you and I have actually talked about this-
[2058.64 → 2059.52] For years!
[2059.92 → 2061.22] Many times in the past.
[2061.64 → 2063.16] Especially close to the whole time we've known each other.
[2063.16 → 2069.96] And if you go back far enough, because Luke and I both suffer from some form of undiagnosed
[2069.96 → 2072.10] face blindness slash-
[2072.10 → 2072.34] Oh, yeah.
[2072.42 → 2075.16] Just complete inability to remember people's names.
[2075.46 → 2075.74] Oh, yeah.
[2075.74 → 2079.28] And we have talked about this many times in the past.
[2079.28 → 2083.04] How what would ultimately sell us, going all the way back to the launch of Google Glass,
[2083.38 → 2090.46] what would ultimately sell us on this technology would be if it could serve as a Rolodex, essentially.
[2090.46 → 2095.80] When you're at a party or social function or a work event, and it'll just tell you, okay,
[2096.12 → 2097.16] that's who that is.
[2097.54 → 2100.72] Bring up the last email that I exchanged with them.
[2100.72 → 2104.38] Tell me, like, how many kids they have so I can ask how their kids are doing.
[2104.70 → 2111.34] And if you go back far enough, you and I were naive enough slash the world hadn't distended
[2111.34 → 2111.94] into-
[2111.94 → 2112.44] Distended.
[2112.94 → 2118.36] Distended into dystopia enough that we were actually bullish on it and wanted it.
[2118.36 → 2125.64] Now, I read about this thing that I asked for, that I wanted, because it would be really
[2125.64 → 2127.48] helpful to me in my daily life.
[2127.72 → 2131.86] And I look at it and I go, holy s***, this is f***ed.
[2132.84 → 2133.48] We're f***ed.
[2133.80 → 2134.60] Everything's f***ed.
[2134.84 → 2140.12] Yeah, well, because I think the thing that we were wrong about, and I think a lot of people,
[2140.62 → 2145.02] including us, were wrong about these types of things, were that we thought it was going
[2145.02 → 2145.72] to be ours.
[2147.04 → 2147.44] Yeah.
[2147.44 → 2150.68] Like, the whole Rolodex idea is that you knew these people.
[2150.90 → 2151.12] Yeah.
[2151.18 → 2153.12] You were essentially inputting this information.
[2153.32 → 2156.68] It was checking locally to your information and then letting you know.
[2156.94 → 2161.78] And that's just not going to be what it is because data makes the world go round.
[2162.02 → 2166.48] So instead of it being yours, it's going to be Zuck's or whoever else is.
[2166.62 → 2166.68] Yeah.
[2166.76 → 2171.00] And you're going to be checking against their information and giving them more information,
[2171.12 → 2175.00] also known as updated facial recognition information for these people to make sure that they're
[2175.02 → 2175.68] it's more accurate.
[2176.16 → 2180.42] And any data and analysis that you're able to scrape from that moment is going to go
[2180.42 → 2180.94] up as well.
[2181.08 → 2182.20] It's going to share into a pool.
[2182.36 → 2187.48] I also didn't think about, at that time, maybe I was just younger and more naive, right?
[2187.52 → 2192.12] Like, I didn't think about an authoritarian government using this technology.
[2192.38 → 2192.90] Oh, yeah.
[2192.94 → 2196.86] To keep track of absolutely everyone and where they go and what they do and who they see.
[2196.86 → 2199.22] Police officers or whoever else.
[2199.46 → 2199.60] Yeah.
[2199.66 → 2201.22] Because they already have it in cameras.
[2202.10 → 2203.24] So that's not really new.
[2203.24 → 2207.32] But this would be, yeah, give them to police officers, facial recognize, figure out if
[2207.32 → 2209.22] they have, like, outstanding warrants or whatever else.
[2209.44 → 2211.44] But it's not just, like, the outstanding warrants.
[2211.60 → 2212.76] Like, this could tell people...
[2212.76 → 2213.08] Suspect level.
[2213.48 → 2215.10] All kinds of stuff.
[2215.20 → 2217.28] All kinds of stuff about people.
[2217.86 → 2218.20] Right?
[2218.30 → 2219.38] That comes down to...
[2219.38 → 2224.22] We have another topic that we'll talk about later, but it's the minority report thing.
[2224.68 → 2224.88] Yeah.
[2224.94 → 2232.62] Like, Buddy here frequents, you know, the seedy theatre, you know, on 6th Street.
[2233.24 → 2236.50] And that might be factually true.
[2237.10 → 2237.34] Right?
[2237.46 → 2240.00] But that could activate someone's prejudices.
[2240.62 → 2241.24] You know what I mean?
[2241.24 → 2242.62] So it's not...
[2242.62 → 2246.32] Like, I don't even mind if it scans someone, and it's like, there's an outstanding warrant
[2246.32 → 2246.92] for their arrest.
[2247.02 → 2247.22] That sounds...
[2247.22 → 2247.38] Yeah.
[2247.38 → 2247.82] Yeah.
[2247.82 → 2247.94] Yeah.
[2247.94 → 2248.08] Yeah.
[2248.08 → 2249.24] Actually reasonably helpful.
[2249.28 → 2250.66] It's one like, say there's a...
[2250.66 → 2253.10] Say there's a riot going on.
[2253.46 → 2253.60] Yeah.
[2253.60 → 2257.66] Because every time that there's a riot, there's some people that are, you know, involved with
[2257.66 → 2258.54] the bad things in the riot.
[2258.54 → 2258.60] Yeah.
[2258.60 → 2259.72] And other people are just trying to get away.
[2259.72 → 2262.40] And it's like, that woman voted for Hillary Clinton.
[2263.38 → 2266.88] And this riot is based around whatever, so she has an increased likeliness of being one
[2266.88 → 2270.22] of the people that is involved with the damaging of cars, so arrest her.
[2270.34 → 2271.36] Even though you didn't see it happen.
[2271.64 → 2271.84] Yeah.
[2272.20 → 2272.44] Yeah.
[2272.76 → 2276.92] Like, dude, that level of...
[2276.92 → 2281.44] And if you think law enforcement doesn't profile, they do.
[2281.66 → 2282.80] They 100% profile.
[2283.16 → 2285.34] And you give them more and more tools to profile.
[2285.34 → 2286.34] We are...
[2286.34 → 2289.80] I don't know if I want to live on this planet anymore.
[2291.12 → 2291.72] You know?
[2292.62 → 2295.34] I had a conversation recently where I was...
[2296.62 → 2300.78] I mentioned that I want to die on Mars.
[2302.78 → 2305.28] And I was like, yeah, that just increases over time.
[2306.98 → 2310.52] Handyman says, to be fair, I think you should mention the story is kind of exaggerated.
[2310.76 → 2313.68] Since you can already achieve this using your mobile phone camera or any kind of camera,
[2313.68 → 2315.40] it's basically just calling third-party services.
[2315.70 → 2315.94] It's the subtlety.
[2316.22 → 2319.20] And we did acknowledge that it already exists.
[2319.28 → 2323.02] That's their whole point, is that this already exists.
[2323.80 → 2326.12] But it's the form factor that's scary.
[2326.32 → 2329.58] Because somebody can walk into a bathroom wearing a pair of glasses.
[2330.28 → 2336.30] You can't walk into a bathroom with your phone out, streaming data to some third-party,
[2336.54 → 2338.66] you know, image identification service.
[2338.70 → 2342.40] Unless your name is Guy, whatever his last name is.
[2342.40 → 2343.74] Yeah, I don't know.
[2343.82 → 2345.20] Yeah, like, no...
[2345.20 → 2346.36] Like, this is the...
[2346.36 → 2350.14] No cool person walks into a bathroom with their camera out.
[2350.74 → 2353.06] That's a pretty normal-looking pair of glasses.
[2353.30 → 2353.96] They're just glasses.
[2355.24 → 2356.86] That's what's scary about it.
[2357.08 → 2360.46] And the fact that, you're right, this is just totally a thing that already exists,
[2360.66 → 2362.82] is exactly their point.
[2364.64 → 2367.06] They're not developing this as a product.
[2367.24 → 2368.18] They're not even trying to.
[2368.18 → 2370.00] They're not even releasing what they've done.
[2370.48 → 2375.14] And to your point, what they've done is not a huge technical achievement.
[2375.24 → 2378.94] All they did was take off-the-shelf stuff and hook it into other off-the-shelf stuff.
[2379.60 → 2381.42] But that's the point.
[2382.48 → 2387.62] Right now, today, you could have someone walking around, it disorderly says,
[2387.68 → 2389.98] but you can buy a spy camera that looks like a pen you clip into your pocket.
[2390.06 → 2390.70] Yeah, absolutely.
[2390.70 → 2393.74] But it's the ease.
[2393.88 → 2394.00] Yeah.
[2394.32 → 2401.28] It's the ease, and it's the integrations, and it's the smoothness of the workflow.
[2401.48 → 2402.66] Like, if you just have a pen...
[2402.66 → 2403.80] A pen?
[2403.86 → 2406.32] If you just have a pen camera sticking out of your pocket,
[2406.78 → 2410.16] and what you have to ultimately do is, like, go home at the end of the day
[2410.16 → 2414.84] and ingest that footage, and then crunch it on your, like, you know,
[2414.92 → 2420.24] multi-GPU server cluster, and retroactively go back and figure out who you interacted with.
[2420.24 → 2423.34] Like, that's what we'd be talking about 10 years ago, right?
[2423.94 → 2425.14] That wasn't that scary.
[2425.46 → 2429.02] But this whole real-time, you know, how many kids do you have,
[2429.04 → 2433.24] and what are their names, and, you know, where did you go to school, and, like...
[2433.24 → 2435.36] Dude, that's scary!
[2436.18 → 2442.24] I still want the local Rolodex thing, where, like, you have to input the information of the people.
[2442.98 → 2447.22] But then, that doesn't even work, because I'm sure there's just going to be databases
[2447.22 → 2449.96] you can download, or you can use it.
[2449.96 → 2450.88] That data will leak!
[2451.18 → 2451.56] Yeah, yeah.
[2451.66 → 2453.66] All data will leak!
[2453.82 → 2454.34] Leaky data!
[2454.54 → 2455.02] It's our new...
[2455.02 → 2456.00] It's Leaky Condos!
[2456.12 → 2457.04] It's just Leaky Data!
[2458.96 → 2460.70] Leaky Condos is just...
[2460.70 → 2464.40] I'm just saying, it's a widespread problem!
[2464.64 → 2465.30] Leaky data!
[2466.12 → 2468.22] It's going to cause all kinds of trouble!
[2468.30 → 2469.82] Dude, you see 23andMe's in trouble?
[2470.76 → 2470.98] Oh!
[2470.98 → 2472.72] That whole data set's going to end up with someone?
[2472.72 → 2473.74] I'm so thrilled.
[2473.74 → 2473.98] I'm sure.
[2474.10 → 2477.98] I'm so thrilled that relatives of mine have used these services, and I'm so excited about
[2477.98 → 2478.18] that.
[2478.24 → 2478.38] Yeah.
[2478.48 → 2479.22] Really, thank you.
[2479.32 → 2480.04] Thank you for that.
[2480.24 → 2480.44] Yeah.
[2480.76 → 2485.54] And, like, every time we talk about this kind of stuff, we'll have people in the audience
[2485.54 → 2489.62] that are like, yeah, but, like, legally insurance providers can't use that data.
[2490.34 → 2491.90] Guys, laws change!
[2492.48 → 2493.32] Laws change!
[2493.46 → 2493.76] The only thing...
[2493.76 → 2495.02] And people ignore them!
[2495.02 → 2495.96] Yeah, that too!
[2497.18 → 2497.70] That too!
[2497.84 → 2501.30] If laws mattered, then we wouldn't be where we are today!
[2501.48 → 2505.54] I can pretty much guarantee you every single person in this building currently has broken
[2505.54 → 2506.86] the law at least once.
[2507.18 → 2507.42] Sure.
[2507.86 → 2510.50] I probably sped in my car on the way here today.
[2512.50 → 2514.82] I probably did as well!
[2515.04 → 2515.76] Yeah, probably.
[2516.06 → 2516.42] Sure.
[2516.48 → 2517.20] Yeah, for sure.
[2517.42 → 2517.58] Sure.
[2517.80 → 2518.10] Yeah.
[2518.34 → 2520.20] And, like, that's the thing, right?
[2520.32 → 2521.90] So, you know, whether it's...
[2521.90 → 2525.00] So, just to give some insight on that, I bet you...
[2525.00 → 2527.80] Every single person that drove in BC did.
[2528.24 → 2529.32] Yeah, our...
[2529.32 → 2530.20] Our speed limits.
[2530.20 → 2531.66] No one follows the speed limits here.
[2531.72 → 2532.08] Our...
[2532.08 → 2532.62] They're too low.
[2532.86 → 2534.58] To the point where it would be dangerous if you did so.
[2534.58 → 2537.92] I watched a fascinating documentary, like, ages ago.
[2538.12 → 2541.34] I've looked for it multiple times, and I haven't been able to find it, so it must have been
[2541.34 → 2542.44] pulled off of YouTube or something.
[2542.52 → 2543.44] It must have been copyrighted.
[2543.70 → 2548.96] But it was basically, like, an investigation into our speed limits and why they're too low
[2548.96 → 2553.28] and why it's, like, actually dangerous and it just...
[2553.28 → 2557.02] They just need to go up and how the provincial government just ignores it for the most part.
[2557.24 → 2557.64] Yeah.
[2557.64 → 2558.12] Yeah, fascinating.
[2558.18 → 2558.94] It's wacky, man.
[2559.00 → 2565.18] You'll be driving with a police car behind you following the pace of traffic, like, 20 kilometres
[2565.18 → 2566.30] an hour above the speed limit.
[2566.36 → 2566.54] Yep.
[2567.26 → 2568.58] Police cars not lighting you up.
[2568.58 → 2569.94] And they'll, like, go around you.
[2569.94 → 2570.20] Yeah.
[2570.38 → 2573.00] They'll also get frustrated because you're actually going too slow.
[2573.08 → 2573.18] Yeah.
[2573.18 → 2575.18] It's just like, what is this?
[2575.26 → 2575.58] Like, what?
[2575.70 → 2576.32] Oh, man.
[2576.88 → 2577.48] What a joke.
[2578.06 → 2578.36] Anyway.
[2579.10 → 2579.32] Yeah.
[2579.72 → 2587.32] Kabul Kat in Float plane Chat says, and this is such a great example of how laws are often
[2587.32 → 2591.46] so sort of myopic in their implementation.
[2591.46 → 2596.12] It goes, legally, I can't ask age in a job interview because that could lead to age-based
[2596.12 → 2596.74] discrimination.
[2597.10 → 2598.98] I added the end part there.
[2599.44 → 2601.36] So I ask when you graduated from college.
[2601.36 → 2609.08] It's like, yeah, you make a law, sometimes with a really solid intent, age-based discrimination.
[2609.36 → 2610.20] That's bad, okay?
[2611.78 → 2614.16] But people are going to find a way around it.
[2614.22 → 2617.90] They're going to find a way to, you know, technically, either they're going to just do
[2617.90 → 2620.62] something illegal in a way where they're not going to get caught, or they're going to
[2620.62 → 2621.80] find a loophole.
[2621.88 → 2623.68] They're going to find a way to technically get around it.
[2624.22 → 2629.40] It's just, our data is not going to be protected.
[2629.40 → 2633.20] These products are absolutely going to end up in nefarious hands.
[2633.40 → 2636.52] And I'm so uncomfortable with it.
[2636.82 → 2636.88] Yeah.
[2637.94 → 2641.66] And then, out of the other side of my mouth, I talk about how I want to do, like, automated
[2641.66 → 2645.58] score keeping at the badminton centre and how we could use facial recognition to track people's
[2645.58 → 2647.38] gameplay and, you know, whatever else.
[2647.38 → 2653.08] In fairness to me, I trust myself to store that data only locally on site.
[2654.34 → 2657.00] But maybe I shouldn't.
[2657.20 → 2660.22] And that still doesn't technically mean that it's invulnerable.
[2660.48 → 2661.18] And it doesn't.
[2661.48 → 2665.62] And, you know, I hate to open this can of worms again.
[2665.84 → 2667.58] But let's say that, you know, I died.
[2667.92 → 2669.30] Or I sold the company.
[2669.42 → 2670.06] Or whatever else.
[2670.78 → 2672.14] There might be an expectation.
[2672.46 → 2675.64] Sorry, I'm not laughing because he said I'm going to die.
[2676.64 → 2679.64] I'm laughing because I realized the can of worms that he's mentioning that he's opening.
[2679.76 → 2680.18] My bad.
[2680.30 → 2680.62] My bad.
[2680.62 → 2687.06] My point is that that data sitting there could be seen as a treasure trove by whoever, you
[2687.06 → 2689.72] know, inherits or purchases that business.
[2689.84 → 2692.10] And you saw what happened with the servers at NCX?
[2692.86 → 2693.30] Yeah.
[2693.78 → 2694.78] Like, this happened.
[2694.78 → 2700.20] The thing, the hypothetical that I'm talking about right now actually happened at NCX.
[2700.32 → 2701.06] The owner didn't die.
[2701.20 → 2703.86] But the data was not managed correctly.
[2704.40 → 2708.08] And people who ended up with servers from the auction ended up with customer data from
[2708.08 → 2708.50] the auction.
[2708.74 → 2710.76] That absolutely happened.
[2712.90 → 2715.28] All right.
[2718.88 → 2719.38] Cool.
[2719.80 → 2723.42] We're supposed to explain merge messages and do two merge messages now.
[2723.50 → 2723.96] Thanks, Dan.
[2723.96 → 2724.36] Okay.
[2724.36 → 2725.66] So, merge messages.
[2726.60 → 2730.96] If you want to interact with the WAN show, the best way to do it is to send a merge message
[2730.96 → 2732.90] like Chris F down here.
[2733.20 → 2737.86] Instead of sending super chats or Twitch bits or anything like that, we strongly encourage
[2737.86 → 2738.90] people to send a merge message.
[2738.98 → 2740.58] That way you can throw money at your screen.
[2740.94 → 2745.26] You can support the WAN show and all the, you know, cool people who produce the WAN show
[2745.26 → 2745.68] and me.
[2747.58 → 2751.34] And you can also send in a, I don't know, something.
[2751.44 → 2751.64] Whatever.
[2751.74 → 2752.44] You can send a message.
[2752.44 → 2756.78] So, it'll either be replied to by producer Dan or he'll send it to someone internally
[2756.78 → 2758.38] who can answer your question for you.
[2758.48 → 2761.30] Or he'll just pop it up on the screen if you've just got a shout-out or something like
[2761.30 → 2761.52] that.
[2761.56 → 2762.64] Or he will curate it.
[2763.20 → 2765.24] And that'll look a little something like this.
[2765.30 → 2766.68] Dan, do you have a couple of curated merge messages?
[2766.68 → 2767.94] Oh, I didn't tell people how to send one.
[2767.94 → 2773.00] Go to lttstore.com and add anything to your cart, and you will see a box where you can
[2773.00 → 2773.76] fill it a merge message.
[2773.82 → 2774.04] All right.
[2774.08 → 2774.48] There we go.
[2774.96 → 2775.12] Sure.
[2775.20 → 2775.32] Yeah.
[2775.32 → 2776.20] I've got one here for you.
[2776.48 → 2777.20] Hey, LLD.
[2777.46 → 2781.92] Did you ever get any contact from fixity with how they feel about your precision screwdriver?
[2781.92 → 2787.24] Um, yes.
[2788.88 → 2793.50] Um, I, I'm not really sure.
[2793.74 → 2796.02] I'm not really sure what to make of it.
[2796.44 → 2797.38] Are you talking about the tweet?
[2797.82 → 2798.24] No.
[2798.42 → 2798.62] Oh.
[2799.32 → 2799.68] No, no.
[2799.78 → 2805.56] I'm talking about, uh, I'm talking about an email that came through after we talked
[2805.56 → 2809.30] about it on the, uh, after we talked about it on the WAN show.
[2810.54 → 2812.22] Basically, we got an email.
[2812.70 → 2812.94] Yeah.
[2813.08 → 2813.56] You know what?
[2813.62 → 2813.90] Screw it.
[2813.90 → 2818.46] We got an email from their agency saying that they are going to be pausing our relationship.
[2819.10 → 2822.22] Um, they provided some reasons for that are like, whatever.
[2822.60 → 2828.48] Um, I told our team, they, they agreed to continue throughout the rest of the month of October,
[2828.48 → 2834.32] but I, I told the team if they want out, uh, we shouldn't force them to work with someone
[2834.32 → 2835.38] that they don't want to work with.
[2835.38 → 2839.42] So if it's, uh, you know, if it's the reasons they stated, then, you know, cool, they can
[2839.42 → 2843.10] keep going or whatever, or if it's different reasons, and they're not comfortable working
[2843.10 → 2846.26] together, you know, that's fine.
[2846.68 → 2851.84] Uh, basically what I, what I left off with was, um, we take our partnerships seriously.
[2851.84 → 2855.64] We want to maintain positive working relationships with everyone who shares our passion for repairable
[2855.64 → 2856.18] technology.
[2856.68 → 2858.26] Um, just tell them, take their time.
[2858.26 → 2859.68] We'll be here when they're ready.
[2861.56 → 2863.50] I'm good or whatever.
[2863.72 → 2870.24] I mean, we're, we're at a scale right now where no one sponsor can do anything which
[2870.24 → 2873.42] impact us important, which is, which is super important.
[2874.08 → 2880.38] Um, and, and to be clear guys, there could be totally, totally unrelated business reasons
[2880.38 → 2881.60] or, or whatever, right?
[2881.60 → 2886.56] Like, I don't want you guys to pass any kind of judgment, but we have heard back from them.
[2887.22 → 2893.00] Um, not about this, like not in response to any questions.
[2893.40 → 2895.46] Um, we just heard from the agency.
[2895.46 → 2897.82] So, so that's, that's where we're at.
[2898.14 → 2901.08] Um, transparency, transparency.
[2902.08 → 2906.12] Um, no, I'm, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to tell the reasons because that's, that's their
[2906.12 → 2906.74] personal biz.
[2907.02 → 2907.28] Right.
[2907.28 → 2909.00] So, yeah.
[2909.00 → 2913.48] Like, but, but there, what I will say is they, they sound like perfectly plausible business
[2913.48 → 2913.82] reasons.
[2913.82 → 2915.90] So I'm not, there's, there's no judgment here.
[2916.28 → 2921.34] Uh, I just want to make it clear that from our side, um, we have no intention of forcing
[2921.34 → 2925.74] them to fulfill any kind of pre-agreed contractual obligation.
[2925.74 → 2928.62] If they want out, then I have absolutely no problem with that.
[2928.78 → 2932.70] And if they ever want to, if they ever want to work with us in the future, then the door
[2932.70 → 2933.64] is a hundred percent open.
[2933.98 → 2941.72] But if I were you, I wouldn't expect to see a ton of fixity, um, sponsorships on, uh, Linus
[2941.72 → 2943.10] Media Group properties.
[2943.56 → 2946.76] Um, you'll, you'll probably still see their products show up from time to time.
[2946.76 → 2950.16] Like I've said over and over and over again, we like the products.
[2950.32 → 2951.26] We love the mission.
[2951.84 → 2954.16] Um, we consider them an ally.
[2954.30 → 2955.32] And so it is what it is.
[2955.74 → 2958.56] Well, all right then.
[2958.80 → 2959.26] Next up.
[2959.58 → 2959.86] Yeah.
[2959.92 → 2961.52] I get some announcements out of you first.
[2962.54 → 2964.50] Uh, oh wait, no, don't we have another merch message?
[2964.62 → 2966.28] No, you got to do the announcements, and then you get one more.
[2966.38 → 2967.26] Oh, I do the announcements.
[2967.50 → 2967.82] Okay.
[2968.18 → 2971.42] The long sleeve polo shirt is now available.
[2971.88 → 2976.26] We wanted to make something that you could wear to the office this fall without sacrificing
[2976.26 → 2981.30] comfort and without sacrificing having a little personality.
[2981.52 → 2981.94] A little flair.
[2982.56 → 2984.52] A little bit of flair, a little bit of spark.
[2984.52 → 2989.78] So we created a long sleeve polo shirt made of soft and slightly stretchy cotton elastin
[2989.78 → 2990.34] pique.
[2990.60 → 2991.38] Is that the word?
[2991.48 → 2991.70] Peak?
[2991.90 → 2992.16] Pique?
[2992.44 → 2992.76] Whatever.
[2993.12 → 2996.22] The best part is under the collar is a fun little pop of pink.
[2996.62 → 2999.72] You'll also notice that the buttons on the polo shirt aren't buttons.
[3000.20 → 3001.08] They're snaps.
[3001.08 → 3005.52] Not only are they easier to fasten, but they're great for jobs where buttons aren't allowed.
[3005.52 → 3009.52] Like when you're working with specific machinery where loose items can't be risked.
[3010.30 → 3013.94] Available now at leg.GG slash long polo.
[3014.02 → 3016.22] And that link goes to the forum?
[3016.22 → 3020.98] That may be misdirected.
[3021.48 → 3025.90] Daniel Lesser is looking at it right now because I think he probably saw me click on it and saw
[3025.90 → 3027.52] me go to linustechtips.com.
[3028.14 → 3028.62] Yep.
[3028.76 → 3030.42] That link is not working.
[3030.68 → 3035.00] So I'm just going to manually show you guys the long sleeve polo.
[3035.00 → 3035.64] Oh my goodness.
[3035.70 → 3037.82] This is such a hilarious shot of Dennis.
[3038.48 → 3042.00] They've definitely been having some fun with the photo shoots lately.
[3042.72 → 3043.90] Massive shout out the team.
[3044.16 → 3047.20] This is great.
[3047.36 → 3048.10] Actually looks dope.
[3048.36 → 3049.14] Oh man.
[3049.28 → 3050.36] I love it.
[3052.52 → 3054.08] Tatiana, Sherwood.
[3055.08 → 3055.60] Yeah.
[3055.76 → 3056.98] I love the posed ones.
[3057.14 → 3057.38] Yeah.
[3057.52 → 3060.12] I actually am kind of loving it.
[3060.82 → 3061.14] Yeah.
[3061.28 → 3062.10] These look great.
[3062.46 → 3062.72] Yeah.
[3062.72 → 3066.86] Do groups of people posed in, in, in things.
[3067.42 → 3072.48] The office attire has actually been a shockingly big mover for us.
[3073.08 → 3078.04] Just like something that's just, yeah, that's just, is there even a logo on this?
[3078.16 → 3078.54] Oh yeah.
[3078.78 → 3079.46] Very subtle.
[3079.88 → 3080.12] Yeah.
[3080.14 → 3081.62] Here I can switch to the loot cam.
[3082.22 → 3083.82] If you can show the people the logo.
[3085.16 → 3085.66] Oh yeah.
[3085.66 → 3086.32] It's in there somewhere.
[3087.22 → 3087.62] Yeah.
[3087.62 → 3090.98] We want to, you know, we want to, we want people to be able to rep the brand without
[3090.98 → 3091.54] like,
[3091.54 → 3096.48] feeling uncomfortable if the or if their workplace doesn't allow logos or whatever else.
[3096.98 → 3099.10] Um, yeah, it's just, just quality product.
[3099.22 → 3099.66] Trust me, bro.
[3099.68 → 3100.94] Guarantee all that good stuff.
[3101.36 → 3104.42] Uh, the cargo pants have been doing really well, by the way, I have some good news.
[3104.54 → 3109.86] If you're a 32 inch unseam, I believe our reorder will include 32 inch unseam.
[3109.86 → 3116.74] Um, so we are, we are currently putting together a list for a reorder and, uh, longer boys are
[3116.74 → 3118.84] going to be pretty excited to see that.
[3118.94 → 3119.14] I think.
[3119.58 → 3120.76] That's, that's mine.
[3120.82 → 3122.58] I think you mentioned you were too.
[3122.96 → 3123.36] 32?
[3124.00 → 3126.42] 32, 32, maybe, maybe a 32, 36.
[3126.56 → 3127.48] I cannot remember.
[3128.30 → 3129.36] A 32 unseam?
[3129.60 → 3130.20] 32 unseam.
[3130.20 → 3130.48] All right.
[3130.48 → 3130.78] I think so.
[3130.78 → 3131.50] Then you guys are in good shape.
[3131.90 → 3134.08] Robot 86 asks, how much do you pay your staff for modelling?
[3134.42 → 3135.36] Uh, we actually don't.
[3135.68 → 3137.02] It's completely voluntary.
[3137.38 → 3139.04] It's on, it's during your shift.
[3139.80 → 3140.38] Oh yeah.
[3140.62 → 3141.60] So we do pay.
[3141.70 → 3142.30] So you get.
[3142.62 → 3142.88] Yeah.
[3143.38 → 3144.02] You're hourly.
[3144.32 → 3144.52] Yep.
[3144.70 → 3146.54] And it's, and it's completely voluntary.
[3146.54 → 3148.64] If people want to do it, then that's totally cool.
[3148.64 → 3154.22] So everyone who ever posed like in their underwear did so because they were like, I'm going to
[3154.22 → 3154.98] pose on my underwear.
[3155.52 → 3156.14] Let's go.
[3156.76 → 3161.90] Um, oh, you usually, or often, or always, I forget the exact rules.
[3162.12 → 3164.68] I think you get to keep the thing that you modelled as well.
[3165.06 → 3168.82] So yeah, it's just, if you feel like it, and you want to, and you want to like rep the brand
[3168.82 → 3170.80] and you want to be on the site, then you can do that.
[3170.80 → 3171.88] Or otherwise you don't have to.
[3171.88 → 3175.92] There is absolutely no pressure whatsoever to model the merge.
[3176.12 → 3176.32] Yep.
[3176.32 → 3178.70] And I just, I think it's so cool that people volunteer.
[3179.04 → 3184.34] I think it's so cool that the models on our site are actual people who actually work on
[3184.34 → 3185.32] actual stuff here.
[3185.46 → 3192.58] Uh, so like Thomas works for creator warehouse, um, in, in engineering, he's working on a cat
[3192.58 → 3193.38] toy right now.
[3193.38 → 3198.38] Oh, among other things that I can't talk about, but the cat toy is like a low prior thing that
[3198.38 → 3199.04] he's working on.
[3199.16 → 3199.78] Uh, yeah.
[3199.86 → 3201.66] Uh, Sherwood from the business team.
[3201.66 → 3203.86] And Tatiana from the career warehouse fashion team.
[3203.90 → 3209.24] Like these, these people, these are the people who actually, you know, bring you the content.
[3210.98 → 3214.08] I love that when I clicked him, he was actually, they were like making an eye contact.
[3214.32 → 3215.52] You have to, you have to look at yourself.
[3215.72 → 3216.04] Yeah.
[3216.04 → 3217.48] Oh boy.
[3217.74 → 3218.10] Yeah.
[3218.14 → 3222.18] So I think that really, I think that really sets our, I think that really sets our site
[3222.18 → 3225.34] apart from a lot of other like merch stores.
[3225.34 → 3232.02] Um, we wear the product and it clearly people want it enough that they're willing to, you know, they're willing
[3232.02 → 3234.66] to pose with it for just to own it.
[3234.66 → 3235.40] So I don't know.
[3235.40 → 3237.36] So I said, can you stand up to show shirt length?
[3237.72 → 3238.18] Oh yeah.
[3238.32 → 3238.64] Yeah.
[3238.84 → 3239.44] Go for it.
[3242.24 → 3243.20] What size are you wearing?
[3243.94 → 3244.34] XL.
[3244.66 → 3245.00] XL.
[3245.14 → 3245.30] Okay.
[3245.30 → 3246.00] And I'm in the medium.
[3253.56 → 3254.06] All right.
[3254.44 → 3254.86] You're welcome.
[3256.20 → 3256.90] All right.
[3259.18 → 3260.88] Uh, what, what are we supposed to do, Dan?
[3261.22 → 3263.78] Oh, you still got some announcements unless you want to save them for later.
[3263.80 → 3264.36] Oh, I have more announcements?
[3264.54 → 3264.78] Oh yeah.
[3264.78 → 3266.60] Oh, good gravy.
[3266.80 → 3267.62] Uh, mod mat signups.
[3267.62 → 3271.28] We are another week closer to the launch of the LTT mod mat to get notified right when
[3271.28 → 3274.14] it launches, sign up at LMG.GG slash mod mat.
[3274.20 → 3276.98] I really hope that actually goes where it's supposed to go.
[3277.24 → 3277.76] This one does.
[3277.78 → 3278.08] Cool.
[3278.24 → 3278.78] That's good.
[3279.42 → 3279.82] Also.
[3280.08 → 3280.40] Okay.
[3280.42 → 3281.02] This is big.
[3281.38 → 3283.60] Um, want to shout out ghost keyboards last week.
[3283.64 → 3290.94] I kind of gave them a hard time for publicly misrepresenting, um, an endorsement from me of
[3290.94 → 3294.48] their product because that never happened, but they made it seem like it did an e-blast to
[3294.48 → 3295.02] their customers.
[3295.02 → 3299.14] Anyway, I don't want to, I don't want to harp on that right now because they have, in my
[3299.14 → 3304.66] opinion, done everything that is, that is, that is right and reasonable for them to do
[3304.66 → 3305.46] to make it right.
[3305.90 → 3312.68] Um, they publicly posted what feels like an actual sincere apology, uh, taking responsibility
[3312.68 → 3319.48] for misrepresenting the situation, taking action to make this right for anyone who bought
[3319.48 → 3321.84] the keyboard based on a perceived endorsement from me.
[3321.84 → 3327.40] They have offered an extended refund window to anyone who purchased the keyboard in question,
[3327.40 → 3330.52] um, during the time that they had that promotion running.
[3330.70 → 3333.70] Uh, so guys, apology accepted.
[3334.00 → 3335.24] Thank you very much.
[3335.32 → 3341.30] I am, I am extremely pleased that we can just move forward in a, positively.
[3341.30 → 3342.32] So yeah, yeah.
[3342.66 → 3343.34] Thank you.
[3343.42 → 3344.64] Top Gear 1224.
[3345.18 → 3347.08] Other companies take note.
[3347.66 → 3350.66] This, this is how you deal with it.
[3351.10 → 3352.18] We messed up.
[3352.64 → 3353.90] We take responsibility.
[3354.76 → 3356.32] Here's what we're doing to make amends.
[3356.74 → 3358.24] We are going to learn from our mistakes.
[3359.00 → 3359.40] Sincerely.
[3360.04 → 3360.34] Boom.
[3360.34 → 3361.96] Thank you.
[3362.52 → 3365.70] Um, yeah, you guys, you guys, you guys made it right.
[3365.98 → 3367.08] And I appreciate that.
[3367.44 → 3373.20] I, you know, I don't think you should have done that in the first place, but look, the
[3373.20 → 3375.20] past has to be in the past at some point.
[3375.44 → 3376.82] And that point is now.
[3378.26 → 3379.50] All right, Dan, what's next?
[3379.62 → 3379.76] All right.
[3379.78 → 3381.02] I got one more merch message for you.
[3381.08 → 3381.16] Sure.
[3381.30 → 3382.32] I'm doing some more topics.
[3382.84 → 3383.78] WAN.DLL.
[3384.20 → 3388.58] Linus, you're a big fan of the Apple AirPods, even though you use an Android.
[3388.58 → 3390.58] Would you recommend it to other people?
[3390.78 → 3394.08] What are the biggest issues you've had that I need to know before doing the same?
[3394.62 → 3395.36] Is this the announcement?
[3395.66 → 3397.56] But do I use an Android though?
[3398.44 → 3398.90] Dun, dun, dun.
[3399.44 → 3400.40] This is my new phone.
[3400.66 → 3401.86] This is the first time you've told them?
[3402.14 → 3405.00] Um, no, no, I've, I've talked about how I'm going to go iPhone.
[3405.08 → 3406.24] I actually haven't set it up yet.
[3406.40 → 3411.60] I tried earlier this week and it errored out because I moved around in the office and I
[3411.60 → 3415.90] think I went to, I think I swapped to a different AP and so the transfer errored out, and I had
[3415.90 → 3416.52] to reset it again.
[3416.52 → 3419.78] So I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get switched to it very, very, very soon.
[3419.84 → 3420.92] It's, it's living in the pocket.
[3421.00 → 3424.06] It's going to happen when I have a free moment, I'll, I'll get the transfer wizard done.
[3424.70 → 3430.48] Um, but, uh, overall there's, there are some annoyances, like the fact that there's no
[3430.48 → 3433.24] official app to change the functionality of the long press.
[3433.24 → 3433.98] That's kind of annoying.
[3434.18 → 3438.60] I don't know if it's just because my phone is ancient, but the, uh, the performance
[3438.60 → 3443.62] of the AirPods when they're paired to an iPhone is so much better compared to when
[3443.62 → 3444.70] they're paired to my note nine.
[3444.70 → 3450.06] Like on my note nine, if I flip on the microwave to pop some popcorn or whatever, I basically
[3450.06 → 3451.04] can't hear anything.
[3451.04 → 3455.28] If I'm standing anywhere near it because of the 2.4 gigahertz interference from microwaves.
[3455.40 → 3460.42] Um, but if I have it paired to my iPhone 12 Pro, which was my like utility iPhone that
[3460.42 → 3462.30] I had and that I will occasionally have them paired to.
[3462.30 → 3464.44] It's like almost flawless.
[3464.48 → 3468.30] It's not flawless because interference, but it's way better.
[3468.30 → 3469.44] Like world's better.
[3469.94 → 3475.90] Um, you know, not having battery monitoring, I guess is kind of a drag, but I just charge
[3475.90 → 3477.34] them every day.
[3477.34 → 3481.24] I've been using like, I just don't really care AirPods with Android the whole time.
[3481.24 → 3482.46] And I don't know.
[3482.64 → 3482.78] Yeah.
[3484.10 → 3484.98] Just plug them in.
[3485.66 → 3486.02] Yeah.
[3486.10 → 3486.88] It just, yeah.
[3486.88 → 3488.62] It just really doesn't, doesn't bother me that much.
[3488.62 → 3491.74] I rarely need them for more than four hours in a row at a time.
[3492.14 → 3496.96] So the actual, you know, battery life of the AirPods themselves, and they charge so fast
[3496.96 → 3498.54] when they're in the charging case.
[3498.60 → 3499.90] It just, I don't know.
[3500.04 → 3501.32] And they charge in the charging case.
[3501.38 → 3502.64] So just plug the charging case in.
[3502.64 → 3506.66] Most of the quality of life issues really don't seem like a huge deal.
[3506.72 → 3507.88] There is one really nice thing.
[3508.20 → 3512.62] Uh, when you're, when you're on an iPhone and you take them out, it'll pause.
[3513.10 → 3514.08] You take one out, it'll pause.
[3514.08 → 3517.44] You take two out, and it'll just automatically switch to the phone speaker because it knows
[3517.44 → 3518.56] you don't have either of them in.
[3519.00 → 3522.00] Whereas on my Android phone, it's a lot of fat.
[3522.10 → 3523.10] It'll just play through them.
[3523.20 → 3527.82] Then again, just playing through them on my Android phone is how I found them when I left
[3527.82 → 3528.68] them somewhere in the house.
[3528.76 → 3530.22] I turned the volume up, and then I was able to find them.
[3530.22 → 3533.58] But then again, if I had an iPhone, I could just use the find my feature.
[3533.82 → 3534.72] So I don't know.
[3534.98 → 3535.42] I don't know.
[3535.46 → 3535.82] It's all good.
[3536.32 → 3537.44] I, I like them.
[3537.56 → 3543.38] I, I still, I, I really like them, but there are some really solid alternatives.
[3543.78 → 3546.94] So, you know, by all means, check out Pixel Buds, check out Galaxy Buds.
[3547.48 → 3550.44] I've heard the latest generation Galaxy Buds are perfect, but I haven't tried them.
[3556.88 → 3559.90] Compton revoked Linus's A plus certification.
[3560.22 → 3562.72] Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[3564.46 → 3564.74] Um.
[3564.96 → 3565.54] How could they?
[3565.70 → 3566.54] No, they didn't.
[3566.60 → 3566.82] What?
[3567.28 → 3567.54] Yeah.
[3567.62 → 3568.48] So I think they type.
[3568.62 → 3568.70] The internet.
[3568.98 → 3570.16] I think they typed the thing.
[3570.88 → 3571.62] But the internet.
[3571.62 → 3571.90] Hold on.
[3576.42 → 3579.64] Here's my, uh, here's my, here's my A plus certification.
[3579.88 → 3582.18] So I'm going to, here, if I read this out, can you verify?
[3582.18 → 3585.30] Uh, sure.
[3585.62 → 3587.48] What, what link do I have to, is it in the doc?
[3587.68 → 3587.90] Okay.
[3587.96 → 3592.42] My candidate ID is comp 00.
[3592.88 → 3594.42] Are you, am I supposed to be doing it?
[3595.94 → 3597.26] Are you, are you doing okay, Luke?
[3597.44 → 3597.86] You okay?
[3598.46 → 3599.28] Luke, are you okay over here?
[3599.28 → 3599.48] Okay.
[3599.48 → 3599.90] I got it.
[3600.00 → 3600.26] Okay.
[3600.60 → 3602.02] I thought you wanted me to actually type it in.
[3602.14 → 3603.38] Comp 001.
[3603.84 → 3604.12] Yeah.
[3604.58 → 3604.98] 022.
[3605.48 → 3605.70] Yeah.
[3606.24 → 3606.68] 462.
[3606.86 → 3607.08] Yeah.
[3607.58 → 3607.86] 766.
[3609.32 → 3609.86] Oh, wait.
[3609.90 → 3610.90] They totally entered it right.
[3611.02 → 3611.20] Yeah.
[3611.92 → 3612.32] Okay.
[3612.32 → 3613.24] I'm confused now.
[3613.64 → 3614.90] Did they revoke it then?
[3615.96 → 3618.06] Because I thought, Chewy said that.
[3618.06 → 3618.90] Wait, you didn't check?
[3618.90 → 3621.36] Like, well, no, Chewy said, Chewy told me they didn't.
[3621.46 → 3625.34] And he said that he replied to the thing that they didn't.
[3625.52 → 3629.00] And then that, but that it wasn't getting a lot of traction.
[3629.46 → 3631.74] And so I was supposed to talk about it on the WAN show.
[3632.94 → 3634.04] Uh, yeah.
[3634.56 → 3635.40] The verification code.
[3635.46 → 3636.70] Oh, oh, hold on.
[3636.70 → 3639.20] Apparently, apparently this is the verification code.
[3639.36 → 3639.52] Okay.
[3639.64 → 3642.48] Well, uh, verify.com.
[3642.54 → 3643.04] Tia.org.
[3643.14 → 3643.50] Hold on.
[3643.74 → 3644.10] Hold on.
[3646.52 → 3647.30] Here we go.
[3647.30 → 3650.18] Verification code.
[3650.34 → 3650.70] All right.
[3652.04 → 3652.48] Sligo.
[3653.60 → 3654.54] They missed a letter.
[3655.64 → 3656.04] Yeah.
[3656.18 → 3656.52] Active.
[3656.90 → 3657.32] There you go.
[3657.46 → 3657.82] So no.
[3658.18 → 3658.94] No, they did not.
[3659.44 → 3662.02] Um, apparently the, the user.
[3662.12 → 3662.26] Okay.
[3662.26 → 3664.54] So I gave you the candidate ID.
[3665.06 → 3667.44] So what, what, what code is this?
[3668.08 → 3668.82] Five piece.
[3668.90 → 3672.58] Oh, oh, it's the code at the bottom here.
[3672.76 → 3673.00] Yeah.
[3673.06 → 3673.28] Yeah.
[3673.28 → 3673.74] I see it.
[3673.74 → 3674.98] Not the candidate ID.
[3675.26 → 3677.28] So yeah, no, here's my, here's my framed A.
[3677.28 → 3679.64] Plus that I still have for now.
[3680.22 → 3680.66] Um.
[3680.72 → 3681.38] Look at you, dude.
[3681.86 → 3682.26] Yeah.
[3682.26 → 3682.56] I know.
[3682.60 → 3682.80] Right.
[3683.46 → 3684.50] People can trust the videos now.
[3684.64 → 3684.84] Yeah.
[3685.00 → 3685.28] Yep.
[3685.52 → 3685.94] That's good.
[3686.72 → 3687.60] We needed this.
[3688.06 → 3688.64] My bros.
[3688.96 → 3689.76] They can trust me.
[3689.86 → 3690.00] Yeah.
[3690.00 → 3690.16] Yeah.
[3690.16 → 3690.32] Yeah.
[3690.34 → 3690.66] All right.
[3690.84 → 3691.06] Yep.
[3692.94 → 3696.32] Well, is my product that showed up defective going to be taken care of?
[3696.40 → 3697.32] I think so.
[3697.38 → 3698.48] He's got an A plus certification.
[3699.12 → 3699.36] Yeah.
[3699.48 → 3699.96] A plus.
[3700.18 → 3700.68] A plus.
[3700.80 → 3701.90] That's the that's the grade.
[3702.06 → 3702.26] Yeah.
[3702.82 → 3704.20] It's like A, but better.
[3704.50 → 3705.94] Sounds like you should probably trust him, bro.
[3706.04 → 3706.56] It's Canadian.
[3707.06 → 3709.40] It's, it's enhanced Canadian.
[3709.72 → 3710.72] A plus.
[3711.22 → 3711.66] Sorry.
[3712.00 → 3713.94] Uh, we should maybe do something else now.
[3714.14 → 3716.08] C plus is just D.
[3716.20 → 3716.70] Hey, look.
[3716.70 → 3721.26] Amazon's doing dark patterns again.
[3722.38 → 3727.78] Legacy customers with Amazon's ring alarm system will soon have to pay double for its
[3727.78 → 3728.66] monitoring service.
[3729.18 → 3733.80] According to emails sent to ring protect plus customers, they will be migrated to the pro
[3733.80 → 3740.46] plan in March, which costs $200 a year as opposed to $100 a year.
[3740.78 → 3741.38] That's an increase.
[3741.52 → 3743.76] That's double the number of hundreds of dollars a year.
[3743.80 → 3744.42] That's yeah.
[3744.54 → 3745.06] That's bad.
[3745.20 → 3745.52] Yes.
[3745.52 → 3751.94] One of those customers happens to be verge writer, Sean Hollister, who found it strange
[3751.94 → 3755.36] that Amazon's email started with, this is your reminder.
[3756.56 → 3757.50] As it's the first time.
[3757.58 → 3757.70] Yeah.
[3757.74 → 3761.56] He did manage to find an FAQ that claimed that customers had been emailed about the change
[3761.56 → 3767.44] in September 2021, but he then dug up the relevant email whose subject line read
[3767.44 → 3768.40] important.
[3768.58 → 3770.16] Your plan name has changed.
[3770.16 → 3774.50] In the body of the email, it read, don't worry.
[3774.50 → 3776.42] Everything else is staying the same.
[3776.42 → 3785.92] The actual notification that the plan itself would be phased out and migrated to ring protect pro was located in a small footnote at the bottom of the email.
[3785.92 → 3792.76] That is Sneezy.
[3792.76 → 3794.76] You know if they got the upgrade for free.
[3794.76 → 3796.38] If they got the upgrade for free, then sure.
[3796.38 → 3805.76] Other ring users have posted emails from Amazon on Reddit, which have the heading new name, new features, same great price.
[3805.76 → 3813.64] These emails then go on to note that their subscription will no longer include alarm professional monitoring and SOS emergency response.
[3814.58 → 3817.12] Amazon has not given a reason for the price increase.
[3817.68 → 3819.76] This is flipping wild.
[3820.74 → 3821.68] Here are some screenshots.
[3821.68 → 3825.68] This does not sound like a price increase.
[3825.82 → 3826.92] Here's a question for you.
[3827.64 → 3828.14] Here's a question.
[3828.28 → 3829.20] Is this puffer?
[3831.70 → 3834.10] I mean, apparently.
[3836.50 → 3839.96] Apparently, that's a throwback to our first topic for those of you who are just joining us.
[3840.10 → 3840.24] Yeah.
[3841.76 → 3843.40] That's a massive yikes.
[3843.74 → 3844.50] This sucks.
[3846.02 → 3847.78] By the way, what is happening down there?
[3848.06 → 3849.40] That's the deep rant spot.
[3849.58 → 3850.98] I don't know what it is.
[3850.98 → 3851.32] Okay.
[3851.62 → 3863.22] I don't know how to deal with this because we've talked about this fairly recently, actually, where I basically said, look, a contract should be a contract, and you shouldn't be able to unilaterally change it.
[3863.22 → 3869.28] And the response to that is, well, from a legal standpoint, the contract is auto-renewing on a monthly basis.
[3869.28 → 3870.78] And every month it's a new contract.
[3871.10 → 3874.78] So they're just they're just giving their customers a new contract.
[3874.78 → 3889.20] The problem with that logic, though, is that in my mind, there's an implicit long term expectation for anything with an upfront cost.
[3889.20 → 3895.80] That we are that we are not, in fact, on a month-to-month deal here where you can change it anytime you want.
[3896.12 → 3904.84] And for something like a security system, that upfront cost is a lot more than just, you know, a few hundred dollars on a camera here and there.
[3904.84 → 3908.72] It could be creating a workflow around it.
[3908.72 → 3911.52] It could be training people on how to use it.
[3911.56 → 3914.56] It could be the time that you invest in installing it.
[3914.56 → 3923.60] Once you're once you're in this ecosystem, it's actually a hugely highly fractious high friction.
[3923.82 → 3926.78] The point is that it can be a lot of work to get out of it.
[3926.78 → 3935.98] And so if all you have is this, you know, month to month agreement that can just be changed unilaterally by the provider at any time.
[3936.34 → 3937.72] What is your protection?
[3938.30 → 3940.74] What is the point of having a contract?
[3940.74 → 3952.70] And I don't know how to deal with this because, yeah, you can't, you can't force you can't force a company to maintain the same terms of service and the same pricing model in perpetuity.
[3953.74 → 3956.22] That's not fair or right either.
[3957.76 → 3964.04] But you also can't be in a situation where freaking everything is like negotiating with Darth Vader.
[3965.22 → 3966.70] I have altered the deal.
[3967.04 → 3968.24] Pray I don't alter it further.
[3968.34 → 3969.80] Well, why?
[3969.80 → 3972.12] But I'm stuck in this deal.
[3972.70 → 3973.06] Yeah.
[3974.42 → 3975.32] I'm Lando.
[3975.82 → 3976.88] What if it what is?
[3979.24 → 3984.84] I think we've had these conversations before, but what if you were offered a full refund at that moment?
[3985.86 → 3987.64] Like, hey, the subscription cost is doubling.
[3988.16 → 3991.26] We're going to actually tell you properly instead of trying to hide it.
[3991.34 → 3994.96] To be clear, let's make that major change and then offer you a refund.
[3994.96 → 4002.66] Because I understand the initial buy in thing is rough, but I can also understand where, like, you know, market conditions might change.
[4002.74 → 4006.68] They might need to charge more for the upkeep and maintenance of something.
[4007.08 → 4011.34] But if that's the case, do they just offer to essentially buy back your product?
[4011.34 → 4014.24] I think if they buy back the product, I'm OK.
[4014.50 → 4014.68] Yeah.
[4014.92 → 4016.20] I mean, Google did that with Stadia.
[4016.38 → 4016.96] I wasn't mad.
[4017.62 → 4017.80] Yeah.
[4017.80 → 4034.94] Like, if you're if you can't afford if it's not if it's no longer sustainable for you to offer me the service that you offered me at the price that we that the price that we all agreed on, then by all means, here, you can take your stuff back, and I'll, I'll take my money.
[4034.94 → 4041.44] You can say as much as you want about how, like, they all well, they should have scoped it in better and, like, understood their costs and stuff like that.
[4041.44 → 4046.12] And that's all farewell and good when you're talking about things without doing things.
[4046.28 → 4054.10] But when you start doing things, you run into this problem where basically every company, if they want to be competitive, have to operate on economies of scale.
[4054.26 → 4059.72] So when you're developing something, you have to assume some amount of scale and price into that.
[4060.00 → 4063.18] And if you don't reach that scale, it might not be economically viable anymore.
[4063.18 → 4067.14] But at that point, like, it's not your customer's fault that it isn't economically viable.
[4067.30 → 4068.40] Yeah, that's not their problem.
[4068.50 → 4070.10] So you got to buy back your devices.
[4070.10 → 4072.54] Squirrel King makes a really great point here.
[4072.66 → 4076.64] Like, let's pretend that an employment contract worked like this.
[4077.38 → 4078.96] Would you accept that?
[4079.86 → 4085.32] Would you accept an employment contract that was essentially a month-to-month contract that they could just change at any time?
[4085.58 → 4090.52] I guess employment contracts don't, but contract sort of do, depending on the terms.
[4090.52 → 4092.88] Usually they max at a year and then you have to renegotiate.
[4093.02 → 4096.46] They can, but that's a little more complicated because a lot of the time,
[4096.46 → 4100.84] a contractor can also make the argument that if they're fulfilling the role of an employee,
[4100.84 → 4110.82] that they should be considered an employee and their protections should be employee-grade protections as opposed to just contract protections.
[4111.18 → 4111.24] Yeah.
[4111.24 → 4113.68] Like, there's...
[4113.68 → 4116.02] No, I don't think people would accept that.
[4116.24 → 4119.96] And so if we don't accept that, you know, that we could just be paid less.
[4119.96 → 4123.68] If our employer decides arbitrarily this month that we'll be paid less, we'll then we should...
[4123.68 → 4126.70] Well, yeah, obviously I agree with that to be clear.
[4126.80 → 4127.68] But it's...
[4127.68 → 4128.80] I'm just...
[4128.80 → 4130.84] I'm trying to think of scenarios where that does happen.
[4130.84 → 4137.10] And I guess it happens on a company level, but I don't think it normally happens on an individual level.
[4138.52 → 4140.84] Like, if we have a...
[4141.38 → 4144.10] Some form of work contract with some company.
[4144.70 → 4144.90] Yeah.
[4145.00 → 4148.40] It's very likely that it might be a shorter term renewing contract.
[4148.52 → 4149.00] Yeah, yeah.
[4149.10 → 4149.56] It probably would be.
[4149.56 → 4150.96] But that's company to company.
[4151.08 → 4153.22] That's not person to company or person to person.
[4153.56 → 4155.86] But usually person to person, there are more protections.
[4156.00 → 4159.28] And yeah, and I'm talking about like consumer protections.
[4159.44 → 4159.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4159.94 → 4163.22] Like protections for the individual.
[4164.32 → 4167.48] It just feels like we've ignored them for so long.
[4167.62 → 4167.74] Yeah.
[4168.12 → 4169.88] And I'm tired of it.
[4170.02 → 4170.76] Lena Kahn, dude.
[4171.84 → 4172.72] She's doing work.
[4174.26 → 4175.40] It's been getting a little bit better.
[4176.74 → 4177.06] All right.
[4177.08 → 4177.82] What else we got?
[4177.90 → 4179.00] Anyway, Amazon.
[4179.74 → 4179.94] Bad.
[4180.54 → 4180.94] Stop it.
[4181.72 → 4181.90] Yeah.
[4182.38 → 4182.64] Yeah.
[4182.92 → 4183.74] Oh, sponsors.
[4183.98 → 4184.42] Thanks, Dan.
[4185.10 → 4187.14] The show is brought to you today by Mans caped.
[4187.54 → 4188.84] Can you spot me in this photo?
[4189.94 → 4191.72] Nice.
[4192.22 → 4196.42] That's what you'll look like if you don't tidy yourself up with Mans caped.
[4196.58 → 4199.50] They just dropped the new Chairman Pro package.
[4199.66 → 4204.46] And it has everything you need to transform yourself from Sasquatch to Sphinx.
[4205.26 → 4211.42] Inside, you'll find the Chairman Pro electric foil shaver, power shave gel, and face shave soother.
[4211.42 → 4213.08] All in one bundle.
[4213.60 → 4219.02] The foil shaver features a 360 degree contouring head and two interchangeable skin safe blade heads.
[4219.38 → 4223.82] So whether you're going for smooth as butter or a rugged look, they've got you covered.
[4224.04 → 4231.20] Plus, with their Flex Adjust technology, the pivoting head adapts to the contours of your face and neck, making shaving a breeze.
[4231.20 → 4237.90] And don't forget the Power Shave Gel and face shave soother, which help reduce redness and irritation before and after you shave.
[4238.28 → 4246.88] Check out the Chairman Pro package at manscaped.com slash LTT20 and use code LTT20 to get 20% off plus free shipping.
[4247.08 → 4247.46] Look at that.
[4247.52 → 4248.66] That's international shipping.
[4249.18 → 4249.28] Wow.
[4249.72 → 4250.14] Wow.
[4250.40 → 4251.20] That's good, though.
[4251.46 → 4251.88] That's good.
[4252.28 → 4253.98] The show is also brought to you by Squarespace.
[4254.62 → 4257.38] Ever gotten lost in one of those how to code a website tutorial?
[4257.38 → 4259.04] Trust me.
[4259.14 → 4262.74] Even with all the tech tips, your site can still end up looking like a five-year-old's art project.
[4263.58 → 4265.24] Uncle Linus Painting Company.
[4265.52 → 4268.18] That is actually from me painting at Dennis' house.
[4268.50 → 4268.92] Fun fact.
[4271.08 → 4271.52] Anywho.

[4316.18 → 4318.08] Finally, the show is brought to you by 1Password.
[4318.60 → 4321.24] Imagine your company's security like the backyard of my house.
[4321.42 → 4321.72] Huh.
[4322.58 → 4324.54] That's an interesting shot that they chose.
[4324.84 → 4325.22] Weird shot.
[4326.42 → 4328.32] You've got some real distance going on there.
[4328.60 → 4335.74] The nice paved paths are laid out for company-owned devices, IT-approved apps, and managed employee identities,
[4335.96 → 4338.68] so only the approved ones can enter my house.
[4339.10 → 4346.18] But the shortcuts through the grass symbolize unmanaged devices, shadow IT apps, and trespassers, like Dennis.
[4346.90 → 4351.66] Most security tools only operate on the brick paths, but ignore what lurks in the long grass.
[4351.74 → 4354.20] This is such a weird thing that he's done.
[4355.38 → 4359.14] That's where our sponsor 1Password Extended Access Management comes in.
[4359.14 → 4366.10] It helps weed out unmanaged devices, apps, and identities, ensuring strong and protected user credentials.
[4366.56 → 4369.62] They address issues that traditional IAM and MDM can't handle.
[4369.90 → 4375.36] It's available now for companies with Okta and coming later this year to Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra.
[4375.72 → 4378.40] Check it out at 1Password.com slash Sancho.
[4378.40 → 4380.72] Cool.
[4381.58 → 4381.88] Huh.
[4383.22 → 4383.58] Alright.
[4385.74 → 4386.22] Okay.
[4386.44 → 4387.52] It's merge message time, apparently.
[4387.86 → 4388.22] Yeah.
[4388.36 → 4388.82] Hit me, Dan.
[4388.96 → 4389.46] LDL.
[4389.58 → 4390.90] Hoping you can settle an argument.
[4391.40 → 4393.30] I've been saying for the...
[4393.30 → 4394.04] We will make more.
[4394.30 → 4394.66] Yes.
[4394.82 → 4400.86] I've been saying for the non-gamer, Intel and AMD waited too long to release HEAT chips,
[4400.86 → 4404.38] and Apple now dominates that space with the Mac Studio.
[4404.84 → 4405.28] Thoughts?
[4407.42 → 4408.02] No.
[4410.50 → 4411.18] Alright.
[4411.42 → 4412.22] Next question.
[4412.96 → 4413.78] Well, I think...
[4413.78 → 4415.36] Should we say a little bit more about it?
[4415.84 → 4416.70] Get wrecked.
[4416.78 → 4417.12] Okay.
[4417.34 → 4417.72] Moving on.
[4418.42 → 4419.70] So, okay, okay.
[4419.78 → 4428.88] I think the bigger thing that happened to the HEAT market is that the high-end consumer chips
[4428.88 → 4430.90] kind of took their place.
[4431.14 → 4437.88] I mean, you can get a Ry zen 9950X, which has 16 flipping cores.
[4438.42 → 4439.64] They're ripping fast.
[4439.76 → 4440.46] They're Zen 5.
[4441.06 → 4444.40] And you can put that on a commodity AM5 motherboard.
[4445.04 → 4449.26] I believe some of them even support ECC memory, even if it's unofficial.
[4449.74 → 4451.32] Does Ry zen 9000 still support ECC?
[4451.46 → 4453.84] I actually did not look into that.
[4454.30 → 4454.90] I'm going to have a look.
[4454.90 → 4458.36] Yes, they all support ECC memory with the caveat that it requires motherboard support.
[4458.88 → 4460.28] Is that different from the 7000 series?
[4460.40 → 4460.50] Yeah.
[4460.56 → 4460.68] Okay.
[4460.72 → 4462.96] So, it seems to still be a thing.
[4463.04 → 4465.36] The point is that if you want a...
[4465.88 → 4473.14] If you want, like, a random, like, affordable workstation, you don't have to go to high-end
[4473.14 → 4473.48] desktop.
[4473.90 → 4479.46] And the only real reason to go Thread ripper Pro, to go for a true high-end desktop...
[4479.46 → 4479.72] Oh, right.
[4479.78 → 4483.30] Then on the Intel side, you've got, like, their 24-core chips at the high-end of their consumer
[4483.30 → 4483.66] models.
[4484.66 → 4489.30] So, the only real reason to go high-end desktop would be if you need, like, Mono memory
[4489.30 → 4493.50] bandwidth, which, admittedly, the Mac Studio is going to do a great job of, especially
[4493.50 → 4496.86] if your workload benefits from sharing that memory between the CPU and GPU.
[4496.86 → 4502.82] Or if you need a bunch of PCIe expansion, which the Mac Studio doesn't address at all.
[4503.74 → 4507.70] So, I don't think the Mac Studio is really up against AGT at all.
[4507.78 → 4509.48] I think it's up against high-end consumer.
[4509.62 → 4511.92] And high-end consumer is anything but dead.
[4512.78 → 4514.00] That's not dead at all.
[4514.00 → 4523.38] With that said, I think that Apple has kind of killed their own workstation market a little
[4523.38 → 4523.62] bit.
[4524.20 → 4525.20] I was actually...
[4525.20 → 4528.74] I was thinking of pitching this to Horst as a Mac address video.
[4529.42 → 4537.06] Like, I think the biggest damage Apple has probably done to their M Silicon lineup is by
[4537.06 → 4539.18] making the M1 series too good.
[4539.18 → 4545.68] I have not talked to a single person running a first-gen M series Mac who's like, yeah,
[4545.74 → 4547.64] I really need something newer.
[4547.94 → 4554.82] And I'm sure there's people who are, like, hardcore into, like, music production.
[4555.08 → 4556.50] How old are the M1 Macs at this point?
[4556.56 → 4556.70] Sorry.
[4556.78 → 4558.42] They're, like, four or five years old now.
[4559.06 → 4563.72] Hardcore into music production or who does a lot of, you know, rendering work or whatever
[4563.72 → 4565.90] else, who legitimately, like, needs a better one.
[4565.90 → 4570.38] But in terms of general consumers, which, let's face it, there's a lot of Apple's customers,
[4570.76 → 4572.86] even though they put Pro at the end of everything.
[4573.86 → 4575.18] M1 series is like, yeah.
[4575.54 → 4579.38] Win Len says, yeah, I'm still on M1 and it's great.
[4580.10 → 4580.88] Yeah, 2020.
[4581.20 → 4581.98] Apparently it was 2020.
[4582.14 → 4585.26] Yeah, my M1 Macs, Mac Studio is still kicking butt.
[4585.90 → 4587.80] Jay Fife says M1 f***s.
[4587.80 → 4590.06] Um, yeah, dude.
[4591.38 → 4595.48] There's just, there's, Apple keeps kind of coming out and being like, yeah, we've got
[4595.48 → 4596.36] new M Silicon.
[4597.04 → 4598.32] And, and it's really great.
[4598.40 → 4601.90] And if I was buying a new Mac because I, like, didn't have one, I would, I'd get the
[4601.90 → 4602.66] new one or whatever.
[4603.52 → 4608.56] I think, I think that type of life cycle is just becoming a thing for all computers now.
[4609.04 → 4610.22] I think that's fair.
[4610.22 → 4616.16] I realized the other day, my dad, who still plays, you know, not necessarily the most demanding
[4616.16 → 4618.40] games, but he plays any game that he wants.
[4618.56 → 4618.82] Yep.
[4618.96 → 4620.50] That comes out new, whatever.
[4621.64 → 4622.46] Sandy Bridge.
[4624.32 → 4624.76] Wow.
[4627.46 → 4627.86] Okay.
[4627.98 → 4629.24] To the point where I never realized.
[4629.44 → 4630.42] To the point where you're a bad son.
[4630.48 → 4631.70] It was never a problem.
[4632.24 → 4633.60] You know which one it is too?
[4633.78 → 4637.48] It's the one you gave him for doing the whole room, uh, water cooling.
[4637.54 → 4638.10] No way.
[4638.22 → 4638.44] Yeah.
[4638.80 → 4639.52] That's kind of sick.
[4639.72 → 4639.98] Yeah.
[4640.22 → 4641.54] Because I was like, wait, what?
[4641.70 → 4642.86] Wait, like, why would you even have that?
[4642.86 → 4646.14] And then I looked in his computer, and I was like, oh, if Rob needs an upgrade, but also
[4646.14 → 4648.92] by the way, I have literally given him one.
[4649.08 → 4650.62] He just hasn't built the computer yet.
[4650.80 → 4651.00] Never mind.
[4651.14 → 4651.40] Okay.
[4651.48 → 4652.76] Because he wants to do this.
[4652.76 → 4657.70] Like, uh, I, I haven't had the heart to really tell him that Tynan already did it,
[4657.70 → 4663.36] but he wants to do a like hard copper piped cooled system, and he's like designing it all
[4663.36 → 4664.12] and all this kind of stuff.
[4664.12 → 4664.48] Oh, that's cool.
[4664.58 → 4668.98] With one of the actually one of the members of the community that was, uh, one of the whales
[4668.98 → 4669.52] at Whale Land.
[4669.52 → 4671.44] That's super cool.
[4671.44 → 4672.08] He's designing it with him.
[4672.38 → 4672.74] Okay.
[4672.74 → 4673.92] And it's going to be this like sick thing.
[4673.98 → 4677.68] So he hasn't bothered to upgrade his platform and stuff yet because the games that he plays
[4677.68 → 4678.98] doesn't really need it anyway.
[4679.38 → 4682.64] Um, and because he's waiting to do like an epic build.
[4682.76 → 4682.90] Yeah.
[4682.98 → 4683.16] Yeah.
[4683.16 → 4685.44] I mean, all copper builds have been done many times.
[4685.52 → 4688.04] I don't think, I don't think it matters that he's got like this.
[4688.30 → 4691.22] I don't want to spoil it, but he's got this like specific design element that he wants
[4691.22 → 4693.64] to tie in, which is like genuinely really cool.
[4693.94 → 4695.46] So super cool.
[4696.32 → 4698.60] Luke's dad aimed the ultimate tech upgrade.
[4698.60 → 4700.86] That'd be kind of sick.
[4700.86 → 4706.54] I mean, look, I can't, I can't preferentially, you know, make sure he gets one, but I think,
[4706.60 → 4710.50] I think if you, I think if you threw him in the thing, I mean, he's, he's, he's done
[4710.50 → 4712.28] some stuff for us behind the scenes.
[4712.28 → 4714.54] I don't know.
[4714.74 → 4714.98] I don't know.
[4715.02 → 4715.44] You know what?
[4715.50 → 4717.44] I don't want to, I'm not in charge of that.
[4717.72 → 4717.84] Yeah.
[4718.26 → 4720.72] We'll see if the, if the rule makers are cool with it.
[4720.72 → 4721.76] Clear it with the powers that be.
[4722.00 → 4722.96] Clear it with the powers that be.
[4723.04 → 4723.90] I'm fine with it though.
[4724.02 → 4724.20] Yeah.
[4724.28 → 4725.06] That's, that's what I'll say.
[4725.14 → 4725.66] I'll say that.
[4727.14 → 4731.98] Hey, Luke, Dan and Linus, was there a point in the business where you ever questioned where
[4731.98 → 4736.20] you wouldn't be able to keep promises that you had made to anyone inside or outside
[4736.20 → 4736.76] the company?
[4737.38 → 4738.74] That's a hilarious question.
[4739.48 → 4742.26] Remember the whole trust me, bro backpack warranty controversy?
[4742.62 → 4742.86] Yeah.
[4743.10 → 4743.28] Yeah.
[4743.32 → 4744.86] That was like, that was a big part of it.
[4744.86 → 4745.76] That's what it's based around.
[4745.84 → 4750.14] That's, that's the whole, that's the whole thing where I was like, okay, we should, we
[4750.14 → 4756.20] should really thoughtfully craft something that will be enduring and that will capture the
[4756.20 → 4764.86] spirit of, you know, what, what I would do if I was still around, but also not be, you
[4764.86 → 4770.62] know, an albatross hanging around the neck of someone that might, you know, inherit or purchase
[4770.62 → 4771.76] the company or whatever else.
[4772.28 → 4779.14] Um, and it turns out that what people actually wanted was just a generic sh**, like warranty
[4779.14 → 4782.80] statement that basically just allows us to weasel out of anything.
[4783.42 → 4783.70] Yeah.
[4783.70 → 4784.44] And we gave them that.
[4784.44 → 4784.50] Let's go.
[4784.50 → 4786.06] And they were happy with it.
[4786.06 → 4789.46] And I was like, okay, bye.
[4789.96 → 4790.40] Sure.
[4791.06 → 4791.36] Oh, wait.
[4791.36 → 4792.36] I'm not allowed to say that.
[4793.36 → 4793.90] Um, okay.
[4793.98 → 4794.16] Bye.
[4794.38 → 4794.72] Okay.
[4794.84 → 4802.84] So, um, you know, I, I think as well, like these days, I mean, we have, we have proven, uh,
[4802.84 → 4805.14] that the company has a lot of resiliency these days.
[4805.40 → 4805.60] Yep.
[4805.82 → 4811.66] Um, but in the really early days, I think we were all somewhat doing that to each other.
[4811.70 → 4813.12] Just being like, no, we're, we're fine.
[4813.22 → 4813.94] It'll be okay.
[4814.08 → 4814.72] We're fine.
[4815.46 → 4819.12] These, uh, this new debt or big risk that we've taken or whatever is fine.
[4819.12 → 4821.80] And then, you know, a few years in it ended up being true.
[4821.80 → 4827.44] But I think at the beginning we were all somewhat, you know, if you reassure each other enough
[4827.44 → 4829.02] times, you're kind of reassuring yourself.
[4829.32 → 4829.48] Yeah.
[4829.52 → 4833.86] I mean, there were definitely times in the first six months that, you know, I told Luke
[4833.86 → 4835.06] and Ed, okay, we got this.
[4835.14 → 4835.44] Let's go.
[4835.52 → 4835.80] Let's go.
[4835.88 → 4836.32] Let's go.
[4836.52 → 4840.08] And I wasn't a hundred percent sure if we had this, but I was sure as heck going to do
[4840.08 → 4840.42] my best.
[4840.48 → 4841.46] That might've been some puffer.
[4842.46 → 4842.82] Yeah.
[4842.98 → 4843.74] Yeah, exactly.
[4844.32 → 4844.50] Yeah.
[4844.60 → 4849.10] Um, back to the, um, uh, back to the, the, the backpack.
[4849.12 → 4850.14] For a second.
[4850.50 → 4857.54] Um, my point, my point was always just that the will of the company to honour the warranty
[4857.54 → 4858.82] is everything.
[4859.00 → 4862.36] And the exact terms are sort of immaterial.
[4862.46 → 4870.82] And I think that we've seen this time and time again, since I said that, um, so now you
[4870.82 → 4874.76] guys have a written warranty statement, but if you carefully read it, it's basically at
[4874.76 → 4875.26] our discretion.
[4875.60 → 4876.82] If we do anything.
[4876.82 → 4879.96] And if you read anyone else's warranty, it's the same.
[4880.38 → 4886.34] It's basically at their discretion because a warranty exists as legal liability, but
[4886.34 → 4886.72] covering.
[4887.30 → 4889.02] That's why, that's why it's written.
[4889.90 → 4891.16] It's not for you.
[4891.24 → 4892.20] It's there for the company.
[4892.32 → 4893.18] It's not there for you.
[4893.28 → 4893.42] Yeah.
[4893.42 → 4893.54] Yeah.
[4893.86 → 4896.78] And, uh, there are a lot of things that are true that way.
[4896.78 → 4902.64] And if pay more attention, I don't know what else to say.
[4902.76 → 4904.88] I get shot as a messenger a lot.
[4905.10 → 4905.50] Yeah.
[4905.50 → 4909.68] I don't know.
[4909.96 → 4910.44] Whatever.
[4911.02 → 4916.12] Um, but yeah, just like stop, stop assuming like, yeah, I don't know.
[4916.22 → 4916.44] Company.
[4916.44 → 4916.74] Company.
[4920.46 → 4924.02] Companies aren't here to make you happy.
[4924.02 → 4929.18] That's a hopefully intended byproduct of them making money.
[4929.80 → 4934.86] Uh, Mr. Blonde 42 says a limited warranty limits the customer's rights, not the company's.
[4934.90 → 4935.06] Yeah.
[4935.62 → 4940.44] Um, and, and, uh, what's actually fascinating is we did a video recently.
[4940.44 → 4944.52] I don't know if we've actually uploaded it yet or if I've, or if I've watched it, but
[4944.52 → 4945.52] you guys haven't seen it yet.
[4946.06 → 4949.50] Uh, oh no, I think you guys have seen this one where there's this memory.
[4949.80 → 4952.56] Uh, it's, it's the buying the worst products, the worst products one.
[4952.74 → 4955.04] Uh, the memory comes with a limited lifetime warranty.
[4955.90 → 4960.80] And then if you actually dig into the warranty, which is not available anywhere on their site,
[4960.88 → 4963.96] but Tom's hardware asked them for it when they covered the brand.
[4964.04 → 4965.86] I forget what the brand is, but it's, it's in that video.
[4965.86 → 4969.32] Uh, within the first year you get a brand-new replacement.
[4969.32 → 4975.34] After the first year for the next two years, you get a refurbished replacement.
[4975.76 → 4979.46] And then after that, they charge you to fix it.
[4980.54 → 4981.58] My favourite.
[4981.70 → 4988.70] So if you told me you have a lifetime warranty, but after a couple of years, it basically meant
[4988.70 → 4990.20] give me that water bottle.
[4991.60 → 4992.66] Oh, it's broken.
[4992.86 → 4993.20] Okay.
[4993.34 → 4995.72] That'll be $25 for a new water bottle.
[4996.24 → 4999.30] Is that, is that a fucking warranty?
[4999.94 → 5000.70] My, my favourite.
[5000.92 → 5001.28] Technically.
[5001.98 → 5002.46] Legally.
[5003.00 → 5003.40] It is.
[5003.52 → 5004.42] That's a warranty.
[5004.66 → 5004.80] Yeah.
[5005.26 → 5010.00] My favourite limited lifetime warranties are when they're limited lifetime warranties only
[5010.00 → 5011.46] on manufactured defects.
[5012.04 → 5012.28] Yeah.
[5012.44 → 5017.02] So it's like, if you don't notice a manufactured defect for 40 years, we'll cover it.
[5017.10 → 5019.00] But it's like, what do you even mean?
[5019.14 → 5019.40] Yeah.
[5019.94 → 5021.18] That's, I don't know.
[5021.26 → 5024.18] Like dude, the warranty for the backpack is like, yeah, it doesn't cover wear and tear.
[5024.18 → 5027.72] So literally it's a lifetime warranty on that.
[5027.80 → 5030.98] When you first got it, it's good.
[5031.10 → 5035.98] So if you never removed it out of the box, and you kept the box in a temperature and environmentally
[5035.98 → 5042.98] controlled chamber and then opened it in 20 years, maybe, you know, and there was a defect
[5042.98 → 5043.78] with it or something.
[5044.00 → 5046.46] People had no idea what they were asking me for.
[5046.66 → 5046.90] Yeah.
[5046.90 → 5047.84] And you know what?
[5047.90 → 5048.84] I handled it poorly.
[5049.02 → 5049.40] Oh yeah.
[5050.86 → 5051.56] Let's go.
[5052.06 → 5052.64] Poor handling.
[5053.02 → 5053.34] Yeah.
[5053.44 → 5053.84] Yeah.
[5054.14 → 5056.48] Like, yeah, I did not explain it well.
[5056.78 → 5058.84] And realistically, we should have just.
[5059.16 → 5059.80] You dug your heels in.
[5059.86 → 5060.76] We should have just given them a warranty.
[5060.82 → 5064.06] We should have just, we should have just had the stupid, meaningless piece of paper for
[5064.06 → 5064.16] you.
[5064.26 → 5064.88] We should have just done both.
[5064.98 → 5068.74] You should have given the warranty first and then been like, by the way, it doesn't matter.
[5069.34 → 5071.34] What matters is this other stuff.
[5071.36 → 5073.32] We probably should have a lot of things.
[5073.54 → 5073.76] Yeah.
[5073.94 → 5076.88] You know, at that time, at that time, I think the CW team was like,
[5076.90 → 5078.78] seven people or something like that.
[5078.84 → 5079.42] Maybe even less.
[5079.60 → 5085.16] And we didn't have, we literally still don't, we still don't have a lawyer on staff.
[5085.26 → 5085.42] No.
[5085.76 → 5085.96] Right?
[5086.00 → 5088.92] Like we, we didn't have a ton of experience doing that stuff.
[5088.94 → 5091.52] We wouldn't have enough work for them, but it does suck sometimes.
[5091.76 → 5092.22] Oh, I know.
[5092.50 → 5092.90] 100%.
[5092.90 → 5097.20] I just mean like, I'm looking at it going like it was, it just, it just wasn't a priority
[5097.20 → 5100.52] because we knew that if there was a problem, we were going to take care of it.
[5100.60 → 5101.40] And I get it.
[5101.46 → 5103.18] You know, you guys wanted assurance.
[5103.62 → 5105.66] It's just that what we gave you wasn't assurance.
[5105.66 → 5107.92] The only assurance we gave you was our word.
[5108.16 → 5109.48] And also this worthless piece of paper.
[5111.32 → 5114.34] Along, I don't know if this is true or not, but Along in Flow plane chat says,
[5114.48 → 5118.62] lifetime is the expected lifetime of the product as defined by the manufacturer,
[5118.80 → 5119.92] not the lifetime of the buyer.
[5119.92 → 5120.32] That's true.
[5120.54 → 5121.20] I didn't even know that.
[5121.28 → 5121.42] Yeah.
[5121.72 → 5123.44] No, the whole thing is just complete nonsense.
[5123.54 → 5123.90] That's even worse.
[5123.90 → 5125.82] It's complete nonsense.
[5126.32 → 5131.46] And I don't know.
[5132.16 → 5135.74] But, and to be clear, some companies are perfect about it.
[5136.00 → 5136.28] Yep.
[5136.50 → 5140.04] Like they will honour stuff well beyond what is, what is actually reasonable.
[5140.04 → 5142.44] Usually it's companies honouring things beyond the warranty.
[5142.64 → 5143.12] It's not.
[5143.20 → 5143.34] Yeah.
[5143.34 → 5143.74] Yeah.
[5143.80 → 5147.18] Or they have like an agreement, which isn't technically a warranty.
[5147.52 → 5147.62] Yeah.
[5147.72 → 5149.64] Been exists, says it's a lifetime warranty.
[5149.64 → 5153.20] When it wears out or is broken, the lifetime is up.
[5153.40 → 5155.36] So the warranty has run out.
[5157.06 → 5157.54] Genius.
[5158.66 → 5159.18] Yeah.
[5159.48 → 5160.52] I love it.
[5163.30 → 5164.80] Anyway, we got you.
[5164.88 → 5165.36] Oh, interesting.
[5165.50 → 5168.60] Ben Mitchell said, lifetime fluids in cars equals a warranty period.
[5168.90 → 5172.64] A BMW lifetime fluid in a gearbox is 50,000 miles.
[5174.98 → 5175.50] Wow.
[5176.10 → 5176.58] Yeah.
[5176.58 → 5179.18] The wording of things is so crazy sometimes.
[5179.42 → 5179.52] Yeah.
[5179.64 → 5183.38] Oh, man.
[5185.10 → 5186.00] That's hilarious.
[5186.82 → 5188.98] All right.
[5189.40 → 5189.88] Yes, Dan.
[5190.04 → 5190.18] Sure.
[5190.24 → 5190.70] I got one more.
[5191.12 → 5191.54] Hey, guys.
[5191.58 → 5194.58] Was wondering, what are your thoughts on continuous returns?
[5194.98 → 5196.10] Buy a laptop at Costco.
[5196.32 → 5197.32] Play for 90 days.
[5197.44 → 5197.74] Return.
[5197.90 → 5198.82] Get brand new one.
[5199.24 → 5201.18] Is that bad e-waste wise?
[5201.26 → 5202.32] I'm pretty sure it's fraud.
[5202.32 → 5204.90] It's called friendly fraud or retail fraud.
[5206.98 → 5208.78] So have fun with that.
[5208.78 → 5211.20] Pay your taxes or don't.
[5213.00 → 5216.02] What do you guys think about not paying your taxes ever?
[5216.18 → 5218.32] If I never pay them, they can't find me.
[5218.40 → 5219.48] They won't know I exist.
[5219.74 → 5220.68] And free housing.
[5220.94 → 5221.38] Speed run.
[5221.72 → 5230.54] Don't be surprised if you eventually do get put on a persona non grata list.
[5230.54 → 5235.20] You may not be welcome to shop at Costco forever if you do that.
[5235.52 → 5238.56] Look, I am not going to lie to you.
[5238.78 → 5242.60] I have taken advantage of generous return policies before.
[5243.06 → 5244.52] I shouldn't have.
[5244.52 → 5248.34] That was bad.
[5249.42 → 5252.76] I actually remembered recently.
[5253.44 → 5257.38] Probably the most egregious example of this.
[5259.80 → 5261.36] Wee woo, wee woo, wee woo.
[5261.36 → 5264.40] Yeah, it's bad.
[5264.58 → 5265.22] It's terrible.
[5265.28 → 5270.02] The most egregious example of this was actually when I was working at NCI.
[5272.04 → 5281.42] And I bought three TVs from Best Buy so that I could make a video about a triple TV setup.
[5281.66 → 5282.70] And then I returned them.
[5284.00 → 5284.86] Yeah, that's not great.
[5284.86 → 5288.84] I got to admit, I didn't properly think about the implications.
[5289.80 → 5295.50] Like, I didn't think about that these were basically going to be sold at a loss.
[5295.60 → 5297.34] Like, I didn't look at their open box pricing.
[5297.50 → 5299.64] I was just like, I need three TVs now.
[5300.78 → 5301.90] Oh, I don't need those anymore.
[5301.90 → 5302.22] Wait, do we have to keep these?
[5302.58 → 5303.92] Yeah, I don't need them anymore.
[5304.94 → 5306.60] I kept, they're in perfect shape.
[5306.66 → 5307.74] I put them back all nice.
[5307.84 → 5309.14] Like, is this really that much of a problem?
[5309.40 → 5310.30] That was terrible.
[5310.36 → 5311.44] I really shouldn't have done that.
[5311.44 → 5317.20] But, um, uh, 5609 says, don't people do this with clothes a lot?
[5317.26 → 5321.38] I've actually heard that that's a trend that is skyrocketing right now.
[5321.72 → 5323.36] I forget what it's called.
[5323.56 → 5324.60] There's like a term for it.
[5324.60 → 5325.98] Is it called labelling or something?
[5326.64 → 5330.06] Buying clothes and returning trend.
[5330.94 → 5332.56] Uh, ward robing.
[5333.58 → 5338.86] Um, the yeah, the, the term ward robing may not be common yet, but the trend is, this is
[5338.86 → 5340.40] from times of India.
[5340.92 → 5346.08] Um, so yeah, shoppers are buying clothes just for the Instagram pic, hiding the labels in
[5346.08 → 5348.10] the shot and then returning them.
[5348.12 → 5352.36] And apparently like high-end boutiques are dealing with a ton of this right now.
[5352.56 → 5353.80] That's super cool, dude.
[5354.12 → 5354.80] That's awesome.
[5355.20 → 5359.50] Um, yeah, so it's a it's a whole, it's a whole thing.
[5359.56 → 5362.04] And have I, have I done this?
[5362.36 → 5362.76] Yes.
[5362.88 → 5364.32] Do I feel bad about it?
[5364.42 → 5365.08] Uh, yes.
[5365.24 → 5366.76] Should I do that again?
[5366.76 → 5369.48] No, no, I should not.
[5369.68 → 5375.48] Um, I think that, I think that for, for my part, um, unless I have a strong intent to
[5375.48 → 5379.78] own the product, like I'll return things if I'm not happy with them, if they don't meet
[5379.78 → 5380.50] my expectations.
[5380.64 → 5384.96] But if I buy something, it's because I have a strong intent to own it.
[5385.58 → 5388.02] Um, I'm sorry, best buy.
[5389.02 → 5391.06] I've barely ever returned anything.
[5391.54 → 5396.20] I don't buy very many things, which is probably the, uh, the root of that cause.
[5396.20 → 5399.00] Well, you and I have both taken advantage of extended warranties.
[5399.10 → 5399.46] I know that.
[5399.48 → 5399.92] Oh yeah.
[5400.76 → 5401.66] Let's go.
[5403.24 → 5403.96] That one?
[5408.30 → 5414.18] Given the predatory nature of them, I think I could probably rationalize myself into an
[5414.18 → 5416.08] I don't feel that bad about it space.
[5416.16 → 5416.36] Yeah.
[5417.04 → 5417.36] However.
[5417.64 → 5418.56] It's not technically okay.
[5418.56 → 5422.50] What I will say is I probably took it pretty far.
[5422.82 → 5423.70] Oh yeah.
[5424.78 → 5425.30] So.
[5425.96 → 5426.92] But, you know.
[5427.62 → 5428.24] That's that.
[5429.00 → 5429.48] Yep.
[5429.82 → 5432.70] You just, you decide what you're okay with and you move on.
[5432.72 → 5437.06] And that also happened at a time when I really didn't have any money, which doesn't make it
[5437.06 → 5438.22] okay either.
[5438.50 → 5439.14] But also.
[5439.14 → 5446.04] And I'm sorry, but also that whole extended warranty thing at particularly the shop that
[5446.04 → 5452.14] it happened at future shop was pretty Sneezy and pretty pushy and pretty exploitative.
[5452.80 → 5458.66] Um, it was realistically only through taking advantage of loopholes that you could ever
[5458.66 → 5459.78] really benefit from it.
[5460.10 → 5460.30] Yes.
[5460.32 → 5462.50] And so I found those loopholes.
[5462.68 → 5462.98] Yeah.
[5463.12 → 5464.42] And benefit from them.
[5464.72 → 5465.28] I did.
[5465.98 → 5466.58] Yeah.
[5466.58 → 5468.32] But I shouldn't have done that.
[5471.68 → 5472.08] Sure.
[5472.42 → 5474.16] How did we end up on this topic?
[5474.70 → 5475.54] That was a.
[5476.06 → 5477.70] That was a that was a merch message.
[5477.94 → 5480.04] I don't know what it was, but yeah, it was.
[5481.16 → 5481.76] All right.
[5482.26 → 5482.66] Cool.
[5483.80 → 5484.20] Um.
[5484.60 → 5486.86] Uh, two, three more topics.
[5487.02 → 5487.26] Yeah.
[5487.64 → 5487.94] Hit me.
[5491.18 → 5495.16] California tries to keep big tech out of your brain, but does it go far enough?
[5495.16 → 5496.66] California became the second.
[5496.78 → 5497.76] Oh, it's gone.
[5498.10 → 5503.96] California became the second U S state to officially protect neural data in state law after Colorado.
[5504.42 → 5508.28] Uh, the bill amends the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
[5508.36 → 5512.96] And as such prevents companies from selling or sharing a person's neural data.
[5513.12 → 5516.48] It also requires companies to make efforts to anonymize the.
[5516.48 → 5517.36] Okay.
[5517.36 → 5520.62] Make efforts to anonymize also known as why not?
[5520.88 → 5525.24] Um, and gives consumers the right to know what information is collected and the right
[5525.24 → 5526.88] to delete that information.
[5527.06 → 5533.64] However, some mental privacy advocates don't feel the law goes far enough in how it defines
[5533.64 → 5534.46] neural data.
[5534.58 → 5538.30] While this law protects the raw data from your brain and nerves.
[5538.30 → 5544.60] It's not clear whether the law covers in, uh, in inferences and conclusions made from
[5544.60 → 5545.16] that data.
[5545.32 → 5548.40] Oh, information that is arguably more sensitive.
[5548.62 → 5549.76] Oh, good Lord.
[5549.92 → 5550.26] For sure.
[5550.28 → 5550.50] Sorry.
[5550.54 → 5551.14] I'm reading ahead.
[5551.24 → 5552.20] This is, oh man.
[5552.34 → 5558.06] For example, MIT technology review points out that the whole whole whole that research
[5558.06 → 5564.06] has used EEG data, a measure of the brain's electrical activity to predict volunteers, sexual
[5564.06 → 5567.62] orientation, or whether they use recreational drugs.
[5567.96 → 5570.40] Conclusions like this may not be covered.
[5571.50 → 5577.68] Although what is interesting is that if you were ever not sure if like being gay is real
[5577.68 → 5580.90] because I don't know, you live in the Stone Age or something like that.
[5581.22 → 5581.86] Brainwaves.
[5582.04 → 5582.72] Here you go.
[5583.04 → 5583.34] Cool.
[5583.48 → 5583.96] You're welcome.
[5584.68 → 5590.52] Privacy advocates, privacy advocates have also argued for broadening the definition of
[5590.52 → 5594.78] neural data to include, to include physiological and behavioural data.
[5594.90 → 5600.06] Since brain activity, isn't the only indicator of how you're feeling heart rate can indicate
[5600.06 → 5605.16] excitement or stress and eye tracking can indicate, uh, what choice you're likely to make.
[5606.42 → 5606.82] Interesting.
[5608.98 → 5610.04] Oh man.
[5610.20 → 5610.38] Yeah.
[5610.46 → 5611.12] Eye tracking.
[5611.24 → 5613.24] If it indicates what choice you're likely to make.
[5613.28 → 5616.46] And then if they figure out that you're choosing the one that they don't want you to
[5616.46 → 5620.32] choose, they could do like a flash sale right before your eyes to get you to get the
[5620.32 → 5621.28] one that they want you to buy.
[5623.78 → 5624.78] Well, that sucks.
[5627.24 → 5628.04] That's terrible.
[5629.86 → 5635.18] Um, I'm happy they're moving on this, but I mean, it feels like it's not going to be
[5635.18 → 5635.54] enough.
[5635.66 → 5636.80] There's going to be loopholes.
[5636.94 → 5638.86] We're just, we're boned.
[5639.12 → 5640.62] Even, even at the front, right?
[5640.64 → 5643.78] Like we're boned, dude.
[5643.90 → 5647.08] We're requiring companies to make efforts to anonymize the data.
[5647.08 → 5651.24] That means they're going to do the absolute minimum as required by law and try to hide
[5651.24 → 5652.22] it as much as possible.
[5652.22 → 5653.36] That doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[5657.44 → 5660.50] Siphon says, we already know free will isn't an actual thing.
[5660.60 → 5662.98] You could very much predict a lot of stuff.
[5664.92 → 5665.86] Oh no.
[5665.86 → 5673.26] Corey is the name says the proletariat will rise up and eat the rich before this all gets
[5673.26 → 5674.12] too far out of hand.
[5674.18 → 5674.64] Just wait.
[5675.02 → 5675.26] Yeah.
[5675.36 → 5677.02] I don't know if they can.
[5677.32 → 5677.80] Or will.
[5677.96 → 5680.60] What's, uh, what's, uh, oh man, who did that?
[5680.72 → 5685.78] Um, who did that good video on, um, authoritarianism?
[5685.78 → 5691.32] Uh, ism, keys of power, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5691.42 → 5691.82] Who was it?
[5691.86 → 5692.50] CGP gray.
[5692.76 → 5693.96] The rules for rulers.
[5694.16 → 5699.54] You should watch this because the thing is when you, when you have the tools of mass surveillance
[5699.54 → 5707.38] and you have tools of mass, uh, oppression, uh, you don't actually need a lot of people
[5707.38 → 5715.10] that you take care of really well to, um, maintain power, to maintain power over a great
[5715.10 → 5717.54] many people who you are exploiting.
[5717.70 → 5720.38] And it's, it's pretty, it's pretty scary.
[5720.76 → 5726.58] Uh, it's, it's an older video, but it is definitely worth having a look at the rules for rulers
[5726.58 → 5727.80] from a CGP gray.
[5727.80 → 5731.20] Uh, CGP gray hasn't had any like controversies or anything, has he?
[5731.28 → 5731.72] Who knows?
[5731.90 → 5732.16] Okay.
[5732.26 → 5733.38] Well, I mean, I just mean, okay.
[5733.46 → 5734.20] I hope not.
[5734.42 → 5735.06] It's too hard.
[5735.08 → 5736.18] I just, I don't know who I'm promoting.
[5736.40 → 5736.64] Yeah.
[5736.76 → 5738.88] They just gotta, audiences gotta get over that.
[5739.24 → 5739.58] Yeah.
[5739.68 → 5740.34] It's too much.
[5740.52 → 5742.10] I would be so sad if he ever did.
[5742.70 → 5743.06] Yeah.
[5743.48 → 5746.20] I, I, I, I, I, I have seen his face.
[5746.76 → 5747.24] Oh my.
[5747.42 → 5747.60] Yeah.
[5747.64 → 5751.80] Which I don't know if it's interesting anymore because, because yeah, he might've, he might've
[5751.80 → 5752.42] done a face reveal.
[5752.54 → 5753.30] I have no idea.
[5753.36 → 5754.36] I haven't paid attention lately.
[5754.98 → 5757.78] Um, I would also just like you guys to,
[5757.80 → 5760.82] remember that I advocated for you.
[5761.76 → 5762.50] Don't eat me.
[5764.58 → 5764.94] Yeah.
[5765.06 → 5765.88] Would you eat me?
[5766.20 → 5766.80] Yeah, sure.
[5767.70 → 5767.96] Really?
[5768.50 → 5768.86] No.
[5769.76 → 5771.84] Like, are we talking if I was dead already?
[5771.98 → 5772.20] Yeah, I'm wondering.
[5772.20 → 5774.18] Or you would actually participate in the murder first?
[5774.26 → 5775.34] Well, I'm not, I'm not gonna.
[5775.52 → 5777.38] Like, what, what, which scenario are we looking at here?
[5777.38 → 5778.60] I'm not gonna Caesar you.
[5778.60 → 5778.72] Um.
[5781.42 → 5782.14] I don't know.
[5782.22 → 5783.28] We could find 12 more people.
[5786.08 → 5786.40] Um.
[5786.46 → 5787.84] But if someone else seasoned me.
[5788.76 → 5789.16] Caesar.
[5789.36 → 5789.68] Caesar.
[5789.88 → 5790.08] I meant.
[5790.24 → 5790.78] Oh, okay.
[5790.90 → 5791.14] Caesar.
[5791.36 → 5791.64] Okay.
[5791.84 → 5792.06] All right.
[5792.10 → 5792.82] I'm just, I'm just.
[5792.82 → 5794.00] Put some pranks on that.
[5794.24 → 5794.62] When you start.
[5794.62 → 5797.82] I would put pranks on.
[5797.90 → 5798.04] Yeah.
[5798.52 → 5798.96] Um.
[5799.74 → 5800.18] Uh.
[5800.84 → 5801.70] Lucas and Brutus.
[5801.80 → 5802.04] No.
[5802.64 → 5803.08] Um.
[5803.74 → 5804.34] And you, Lucas?
[5804.34 → 5807.70] No, but when you're, when you're running your cult town.
[5808.14 → 5808.66] Yeah, okay.
[5808.86 → 5811.32] You'd have to be careful to not get Caesarea.
[5811.60 → 5811.76] Right.
[5811.80 → 5812.56] Oh, that makes sense.
[5812.68 → 5812.88] Yeah.
[5813.00 → 5814.52] Okay, I'm not going to be running a cult town.
[5814.58 → 5815.34] We've talked about this.
[5815.40 → 5816.64] That's, that's your dream.
[5817.00 → 5817.80] Not my dream.
[5818.04 → 5818.44] Instead of.
[5818.44 → 5819.06] Our dream.
[5819.24 → 5819.72] It's loam.
[5823.54 → 5824.28] Oh, man.
[5824.70 → 5825.02] Um.
[5825.30 → 5826.80] Crystal says I'm not a billionaire.
[5826.80 → 5828.50] So I'm not rich enough for that.
[5828.56 → 5829.24] And I am not.
[5829.74 → 5831.42] I want to make that very clear.
[5831.54 → 5833.78] By any measurement of my assets, I am.
[5833.92 → 5834.84] Where is the line?
[5834.90 → 5835.76] Is the line billionaire?
[5836.26 → 5837.90] I had this conversation with David.
[5838.02 → 5838.32] I know.
[5838.42 → 5839.42] Like, ages ago.
[5839.52 → 5839.92] I forget.
[5840.08 → 5841.10] I forget where the line is.
[5841.18 → 5841.94] And it's, um.
[5841.94 → 5844.64] It's after hours, so I'm not going to bother him about it.
[5845.18 → 5845.44] See?
[5846.58 → 5846.86] See?
[5847.14 → 5848.54] I'm one of the nice ones.
[5849.52 → 5850.64] Please don't eat me.
[5851.02 → 5852.06] Like, I'd call Nick.
[5852.42 → 5853.46] Like, yeah, whatever.
[5853.60 → 5854.88] Nick's in management.
[5855.18 → 5855.32] Whatever.
[5855.52 → 5855.92] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5856.24 → 5856.70] Yeah, but.
[5857.04 → 5858.88] People are saying, most people are saying billionaire.
[5859.32 → 5861.50] It looks, oh, Canadian or American.
[5861.58 → 5862.82] That's a huge difference.
[5863.36 → 5865.88] Oh, I'm nowhere near either.
[5866.02 → 5866.94] Like, it's not even.
[5867.04 → 5867.50] Oh, no, no, no, no.
[5867.50 → 5868.16] It's not even on the radar.
[5868.18 → 5869.06] I'm saying where the line is.
[5869.06 → 5870.54] Oh, we have to talk in US dollars.
[5870.64 → 5871.92] US dollars is the global measure.
[5871.94 → 5872.66] Measure of wealth.
[5872.88 → 5873.00] Yeah.
[5873.14 → 5873.68] So, okay.
[5873.68 → 5875.28] Well, without looking at the answers.
[5875.38 → 5876.64] Okay, so where's your line?
[5876.72 → 5877.90] Let's bring Dan into this.
[5878.22 → 5880.16] To, to, to, like, to eat the rich line?
[5880.16 → 5881.02] Yeah, the eat the rich.
[5881.02 → 5882.50] Where's to eat the rich line?
[5882.84 → 5884.40] I mean, there are a couple schools of thought.
[5884.64 → 5886.02] Because there's.
[5886.10 → 5886.36] Oh, okay.
[5886.38 → 5887.10] We have an expert.
[5887.30 → 5887.58] This is good.
[5887.58 → 5888.00] Thank you, Dan.
[5888.08 → 5888.24] Yes.
[5888.36 → 5889.36] I mean, because you've got.
[5889.74 → 5891.28] Like, a lot of people talk about the middle class.
[5892.16 → 5892.34] Yeah.
[5892.38 → 5894.18] And the lower class and the upper class.
[5894.18 → 5897.16] But there's only working class and, like, the ownership class, right?
[5897.16 → 5897.78] Oh.
[5897.78 → 5902.68] Middle class is kind of a design to split the people, right?
[5902.80 → 5907.22] Against the, the, the uppers of society.
[5907.30 → 5907.50] Mm-hmm.
[5908.38 → 5911.76] Technically, Linus would be one of those people already.
[5912.26 → 5915.30] Because he employs people and owns a factory.
[5915.62 → 5916.80] But he does also work.
[5918.08 → 5919.10] Yeah, but.
[5920.06 → 5921.20] I don't have to, though.
[5921.90 → 5922.64] You don't have to.
[5922.74 → 5924.10] I think that's, I think that's an important line.
[5924.60 → 5926.64] I don't, I don't have to realistically anymore.
[5927.28 → 5928.12] Yeah, exactly.
[5928.82 → 5931.38] Does Linus deserve to be guillotined?
[5933.12 → 5934.22] Well, hold on a second.
[5934.44 → 5935.78] Let me just jump in and correct you.
[5935.86 → 5936.78] It's guillotined.
[5938.22 → 5938.50] Yes.
[5938.74 → 5940.06] That's probably not going to win me any favours.
[5940.06 → 5940.90] Now that he did that, yes.
[5942.64 → 5944.42] All right, I'll go get the one in my car.
[5945.46 → 5946.46] I've been waiting for this.
[5947.44 → 5948.30] Yeah, I don't know.
[5948.30 → 5950.00] It's, it's a little difficult, right?
[5950.12 → 5952.96] Where, where is the line of like Bezos to Linus?
[5953.30 → 5953.78] Yeah.
[5954.18 → 5957.36] Literature would tell us that there is no line, right?
[5957.48 → 5957.88] Interesting.
[5958.02 → 5963.56] But I can tell you that the difference between my lifestyle, the difference between my lifestyle
[5963.56 → 5965.64] and my wealth and Bezos's.
[5965.70 → 5966.60] It's extremely dramatic.
[5966.84 → 5967.28] Absolutely.
[5968.28 → 5968.72] Incomparable.
[5969.04 → 5969.52] Colossal.
[5969.86 → 5973.54] But he literally wanted them to deconstruct a fucking bridge.
[5973.54 → 5974.24] For his fancy boat.
[5974.24 → 5976.68] So that he could get his boat out of the shipyard.
[5976.68 → 5978.14] Like, this is like...
[5978.14 → 5979.20] This is a historical bridge.
[5979.38 → 5979.64] Meh.
[5979.78 → 5980.02] Meh.
[5980.30 → 5980.74] I like my...
[5980.74 → 5981.84] Everyone has a price.
[5981.92 → 5982.62] I like my boat.
[5983.34 → 5983.86] I would like to...
[5983.86 → 5985.34] I need to get my shirts out.
[5985.60 → 5987.66] My boat needs to be in slightly different water.
[5987.78 → 5988.60] Yeah, it's...
[5988.60 → 5989.10] I don't know.
[5989.24 → 5989.68] I don't know.
[5989.90 → 5990.78] I'm sure there's a line.
[5990.78 → 5991.38] You get my shirts out?
[5991.74 → 5996.78] Well, because you have the $400 shirts, and need them in your villa in the south of France.
[5996.78 → 5999.72] This is a great post from Imperator.
[6000.12 → 6005.38] The difference between $1 billion and $1 million is approximately $1 billion.
[6006.20 → 6009.96] What if you had $800 million or $500 million or $100 million?
[6010.48 → 6010.96] Okay.
[6011.10 → 6012.04] I don't know.
[6012.20 → 6012.54] This is...
[6012.54 → 6014.92] I feel unqualified to weigh in on this.
[6015.06 → 6015.42] I just...
[6015.42 → 6019.18] I'm just kind of sitting here and figuring out if I need to get my go bag.
[6019.26 → 6021.06] Linus has money, right?
[6021.06 → 6023.48] And I think, Linus, we've talked about this after when?
[6023.76 → 6025.40] A few times now, right?
[6025.54 → 6026.80] Linus is...
[6026.80 → 6027.52] He's got money.
[6027.74 → 6028.40] But there's also...
[6028.40 → 6029.12] There's also really...
[6029.12 → 6031.14] But he doesn't have, like, a lot of money.
[6031.24 → 6035.22] There's also an interesting question because, like, the valuation of the company was something
[6035.22 → 6037.56] that was brought up a little while ago.
[6037.70 → 6038.04] Yes.
[6038.04 → 6040.14] So we said publicly what the offer was.
[6040.20 → 6040.44] Yes.
[6040.58 → 6042.90] But this is one of those...
[6042.90 → 6049.14] As much as we've tried to rage against this, we are one of those inverted pyramid YouTube
[6049.14 → 6049.64] companies.
[6049.64 → 6051.64] Where if you leave...
[6052.76 → 6055.04] We're in trouble.
[6055.26 → 6055.48] Mm-hmm.
[6055.90 → 6057.64] Like, the machine isn't self-sustaining.
[6058.58 → 6059.04] Like...
[6059.04 → 6060.16] Like, Amazon will be okay.
[6060.44 → 6063.54] It might have a pretty flat bottom of the pyramid.
[6063.76 → 6063.98] Right.
[6064.04 → 6065.02] An inverted pyramid.
[6065.22 → 6066.68] But it's still an inverted pyramid.
[6067.10 → 6067.74] So...
[6067.74 → 6069.14] And we're trying...
[6069.14 → 6069.92] And we're trying?
[6069.92 → 6072.36] We're trying to make that better, but it is hard.
[6072.78 → 6072.86] Yeah.
[6073.52 → 6074.36] What we do.
[6074.54 → 6076.60] It's not necessarily about that, I think.
[6076.86 → 6076.98] Right?
[6076.98 → 6077.98] I think it is, though.
[6077.98 → 6080.66] Because that is not cash that he has.
[6080.74 → 6082.34] That is an asset that he owns, which is the company.
[6082.34 → 6085.80] If we take Linus out of the equation, I think he's just an example in this, right?
[6085.88 → 6086.78] Take me out of the equation?
[6087.48 → 6089.18] I don't like the direction this is going.
[6089.26 → 6089.48] With what device?
[6089.48 → 6090.94] We'll pull him into pieces, right?
[6093.24 → 6094.84] Like, Linus has money, right?
[6094.90 → 6095.92] Those machines are in Diablo.
[6095.92 → 6096.86] Yeah, exactly.
[6097.08 → 6100.70] But he doesn't have, like, extreme levels of wealth.
[6100.82 → 6101.14] I mean...
[6101.14 → 6101.72] Intergenerational levels of wealth.
[6101.72 → 6105.16] What I'm saying is, too, is if he stops working, also known as leaves the company,
[6105.42 → 6108.18] the value of the thing that he owns goes down significantly.
[6108.24 → 6111.02] But again, it's not about necessarily Linus in particular.
[6111.18 → 6113.14] When we're talking about this line, right?
[6113.50 → 6117.64] Say Linus just owned the factory that is LMG, right?
[6117.98 → 6118.22] Sure.
[6118.52 → 6118.74] Right?
[6118.86 → 6119.78] He could dissolve it.
[6119.82 → 6120.48] That would be fine.
[6120.48 → 6125.18] He could take the money from the buyout, which would be, what, nine figures or something
[6125.18 → 6125.60] like that.
[6125.74 → 6127.92] Yeah, but the buyout required him to stay, so he's still working.
[6128.42 → 6130.92] It did require me to stay for a period of two years.
[6130.94 → 6132.96] Again, you're still using him as the example.
[6133.22 → 6134.52] Yeah, but he's the thing that we're talking about.
[6134.52 → 6136.62] If you had $100 million, right?
[6136.74 → 6136.96] Yeah.
[6138.90 → 6143.70] And wasn't working, or just owned the company and did other things, like, is that where the
[6143.70 → 6144.16] line is?
[6145.28 → 6145.98] This is what I'm asking.
[6145.98 → 6146.60] Is it $50 million?
[6146.64 → 6148.98] Because what I'm saying is, he doesn't have $100 million.
[6149.20 → 6149.70] I don't.
[6149.70 → 6151.30] Because he didn't accept the buyout.
[6151.78 → 6152.34] And...
[6153.06 → 6154.86] But I own an asset that's worth that.
[6155.06 → 6155.18] Sort of.
[6155.18 → 6157.56] But the asset is worth less if I'm not working.
[6157.66 → 6157.90] Yeah.
[6158.50 → 6159.58] So it's complicated.
[6159.74 → 6159.96] Yeah.
[6160.66 → 6161.02] Okay.
[6161.28 → 6163.04] But my question...
[6163.04 → 6165.10] Let's get off the subject of me for a minute.
[6165.68 → 6167.04] That's what I'm trying to do.
[6167.50 → 6167.90] No!
[6170.06 → 6176.26] My question is, where would the line be if we weren't talking about me?
[6177.34 → 6178.36] That's what I'm trying to do.
[6178.36 → 6181.58] Does it come down to what you do day to day?
[6181.58 → 6182.80] Is it your lifestyle?
[6183.32 → 6185.84] Or is it your wealth?
[6186.52 → 6187.42] Like your net worth?
[6187.72 → 6188.80] Or is it your cash?
[6189.64 → 6195.72] Because you could have a very frugal lifestyle, but you could have a ton of cash in the bank
[6195.72 → 6198.62] and just choose to live like a normal person.
[6199.04 → 6205.88] You could have an extravagant lifestyle, but actually have no real assets.
[6206.00 → 6206.46] So you're just...
[6206.46 → 6207.68] You're living check to check.
[6207.88 → 6209.56] But you have a huge income.
[6209.94 → 6217.06] You could have huge wealth, huge net worth, but actually all of it is illiquid.
[6217.46 → 6218.16] Unliquid?
[6218.28 → 6218.76] Illiquid.
[6218.88 → 6219.10] Whatever.
[6219.10 → 6220.42] It's not liquid, right?
[6220.50 → 6221.94] It's tied up.
[6222.14 → 6226.32] It's in companies that are private companies.
[6226.32 → 6230.00] So you can't just like trade the stock on the open market or anything like that.
[6230.42 → 6234.24] So in that category, you could live a very extravagant lifestyle,
[6234.24 → 6236.24] or you could not live a very extravagant lifestyle,
[6236.24 → 6237.58] or you could live somewhere in between.
[6237.58 → 6240.68] Like, what are we measuring here?
[6241.68 → 6242.34] I don't know.
[6242.46 → 6243.70] I think it depends on too many...
[6243.70 → 6247.76] Yeah, you're disregarded for human life, which is an impossible thing to measure.
[6247.88 → 6251.04] But I do agree, which is part of the problem.
[6251.04 → 6253.74] Because like if you own a bunch of businesses,
[6253.98 → 6259.24] but aren't raking disgusting, ruin the world level profit margins like a lot of businesses do,
[6259.66 → 6265.28] and you're employing a bunch of people in jobs that are paying them well and stuff like that,
[6265.28 → 6268.30] if you have a bunch of wealth because you technically own all these businesses,
[6268.60 → 6270.66] I don't think you should just be guillotined.
[6270.80 → 6273.08] I think that that kind of depends on the person, right?
[6273.18 → 6276.04] Because technically you would be of the ownership class,
[6276.08 → 6279.96] and therefore subject to head separation, right?
[6279.96 → 6280.08] Okay.
[6280.94 → 6281.38] Okay.
[6282.16 → 6282.86] But does it...
[6282.86 → 6284.04] Okay, so tell me this.
[6284.10 → 6285.74] On the subject of head separation, then,
[6286.12 → 6289.52] does it come down to what your answer to the trolley problem would be?
[6291.20 → 6291.56] Hmm.
[6292.06 → 6292.86] Would you...
[6292.86 → 6295.70] Do you own the company that produces the trolleys?
[6297.18 → 6298.80] Are you the train company?
[6298.96 → 6300.46] If so, head separated.
[6300.80 → 6305.72] If you are employed by the train company to drive the train over people,
[6306.16 → 6307.82] then you don't get guillotined.
[6307.82 → 6311.74] But does that mean that the person pulling the lever who doesn't own anything,
[6311.86 → 6314.46] regardless of decision, is cool?
[6314.72 → 6315.06] I don't know.
[6315.06 → 6318.78] If you had four billionaires on one side and one billionaire on one side,
[6319.26 → 6323.20] like, how can I drift across both tracks, you know?
[6323.50 → 6324.24] Oh, man.
[6325.66 → 6326.08] It's...
[6326.08 → 6326.54] Déjà vu!
[6326.66 → 6327.08] Déjà vu!
[6329.30 → 6330.60] I've seen that done a lot.
[6331.94 → 6333.20] Yeah, I don't know.
[6333.28 → 6333.66] I don't know.
[6333.72 → 6334.46] Where is the line?
[6334.46 → 6338.48] If it's just monetary wealth, like Linus said, it depends on how you use it.
[6338.52 → 6341.90] If you just have a lot of wealth and are nice.
[6342.64 → 6344.46] Like, okay, Bill Gates.
[6345.30 → 6345.82] Okay.
[6346.44 → 6349.50] Bill Gates versus Jeff Bezos.
[6351.08 → 6354.74] So, I could talk a fair bit about how...
[6354.74 → 6355.44] Drop them both.
[6355.44 → 6358.72] Bill Gates has done a lot of...
[6358.72 → 6360.42] What if I just owned all the farmland?
[6360.86 → 6361.30] Repeat.
[6361.30 → 6361.86] What would happen then?
[6362.04 → 6367.04] What about the guy that bought the onion futures for the entire U.S. for, like, ever?
[6367.48 → 6368.12] And then...
[6368.12 → 6368.44] Yeah.
[6368.64 → 6370.32] Had to get rules made about him.
[6370.38 → 6372.38] What if you'd have just so much money, you can just be like,
[6372.46 → 6373.80] I own all the vegetables.
[6374.06 → 6374.38] Yeah.
[6375.18 → 6376.22] Which happened.
[6376.50 → 6380.62] Gates has yet to provide a really solid defence for why he owns
[6380.62 → 6385.56] such a large proportion of the agricultural land in the United States of America.
[6385.80 → 6387.90] What if I controlled all of their food?
[6388.50 → 6391.28] What if I was the one that got to decide if you eat or not?
[6391.62 → 6392.02] Yeah.
[6393.10 → 6393.90] That's what he's doing.
[6394.06 → 6397.90] I don't know that I would draw a distinction between those two particular...
[6397.90 → 6398.68] I don't at all.
[6398.68 → 6400.38] What if it's living outside your means?
[6400.38 → 6403.56] Like, if you have two houses, guillotine.
[6404.58 → 6408.68] Living outside your means, though, if anything, I think that could...
[6408.68 → 6413.32] You could make the argument that they're a victim of a society that has...
[6413.32 → 6413.92] Hold on.
[6413.96 → 6414.88] I'm going somewhere with this.
[6414.94 → 6415.32] Okay.
[6416.80 → 6417.72] All right.
[6417.80 → 6418.14] Let's go.
[6418.24 → 6418.72] I'm into this.
[6419.14 → 6419.38] No.
[6419.58 → 6419.90] No.
[6420.30 → 6420.56] No.
[6420.80 → 6422.86] Of a society that has...
[6422.86 → 6423.98] They're pulling the rope back.
[6424.06 → 6424.72] That has...
[6424.72 → 6425.82] They're getting ready.
[6426.72 → 6430.88] What if they're a victim of a society that has set unrealistic expectations
[6430.88 → 6436.34] for what kind of lifestyle they have to uphold in order to, you know,
[6436.34 → 6439.30] be one of the cool kids, if that's, you know, meaningful to them?
[6439.54 → 6446.30] What if they're a victim of the kind of lending, borrowing culture that we have
[6446.30 → 6451.36] and they were, you know, they felt pressured in order to keep up,
[6451.46 → 6454.82] to borrow money, in order to sort of, you know, build that asset wealth?
[6454.82 → 6457.60] Is that the way you're trying to use live outside your means?
[6457.78 → 6458.70] Not necessarily.
[6458.88 → 6459.50] I think so.
[6459.50 → 6463.60] I think more like being inside a societal place.
[6463.70 → 6464.94] Like, everybody has enough.
[6465.54 → 6467.02] Like, eventually you have enough.
[6467.48 → 6467.68] Right?
[6468.48 → 6471.48] One of the arguments that I wanted to make was like, okay,
[6471.84 → 6472.34] you make...
[6472.34 → 6475.76] You have more than $200 million, just 100% tax.
[6475.82 → 6477.14] You can't have more than $200 million.
[6477.56 → 6481.22] But then thinking about somebody like Bezos, who actually has no money
[6481.22 → 6485.24] because he just has giant loans, and then he borrows against those loans,
[6485.24 → 6486.48] so he's in debt forever.
[6487.00 → 6487.26] Right?
[6487.36 → 6491.28] He uses his massive stock wealth, which isn't really anything,
[6491.78 → 6495.72] to basically be in, you know, hundreds of million dollars of debt.
[6496.14 → 6498.46] Like, Linus probably has more money than Bezos.
[6499.44 → 6499.94] Probably not.
[6499.94 → 6499.98] Maybe.
[6500.38 → 6501.12] Probably not.
[6501.24 → 6502.90] But you kind of get the comparison, right?
[6502.90 → 6506.22] He's probably got more liquid cash just in case he is like, I don't know,
[6506.30 → 6507.32] feels like doing anything.
[6507.34 → 6511.34] Yeah, in case he gets like a gold-plated tissue paper to blow his nose on.
[6511.36 → 6513.66] I just have a bunch of gold bars in my basement.
[6513.78 → 6514.48] That sort of thing, right?
[6514.48 → 6516.24] I wonder how many seconds it would take.
[6517.30 → 6518.72] It's already that many.
[6519.12 → 6519.38] Yeah.
[6520.00 → 6520.24] Yeah.
[6520.36 → 6524.04] If you have two houses, if you own 400 acres of land,
[6524.18 → 6528.00] if you, you know, have 75 cars, you know?
[6528.12 → 6529.04] Okay, what if I...
[6529.04 → 6531.24] But what if you have 400 acres of land, and it's all agriculture
[6531.24 → 6534.80] and you're growing crops for people, and you're not necessarily making...
[6534.80 → 6535.70] Yeah, what if you're not gouging?
[6535.86 → 6536.04] Yeah.
[6536.82 → 6538.12] Then are you a chill landowner?
[6538.12 → 6539.88] I think a lot of it to me is the gouging.
[6539.88 → 6546.64] How are you actively using your immense wealth to make life terrible for other people?
[6546.78 → 6549.56] And I think just hoarding wealth and doing nothing with it
[6549.56 → 6551.88] is a form of actively using it to make other people's lives terrible.
[6551.88 → 6553.06] Okay, tell me this.
[6553.06 → 6559.44] I mean, it's no secret that the badminton centre, based on the list price,
[6559.58 → 6563.06] is worth anywhere between about 20 to...
[6564.34 → 6566.48] Let's see, what would the math be?
[6567.38 → 6569.70] 20 to 23 million US dollars.
[6569.96 → 6570.22] Okay.
[6570.34 → 6572.34] That's not a secret that you can look that up.
[6573.22 → 6573.78] As of that.
[6574.22 → 6577.70] I clearly own a badminton centre because I made a video about it.
[6577.76 → 6578.40] And this building.
[6578.66 → 6579.30] And this building.
[6579.34 → 6580.10] And the other building.
[6580.10 → 6580.78] And the labs building.
[6580.78 → 6581.38] And the other building.
[6581.38 → 6582.34] And creator warehouse building.
[6582.40 → 6582.90] And your house.
[6583.10 → 6583.64] And my house.
[6585.18 → 6587.00] You forgot my old house where my in-laws live.
[6587.62 → 6588.74] Okay, I didn't know that was public.
[6589.34 → 6589.88] Well, whatever.
[6590.42 → 6590.98] It is now.
[6591.50 → 6592.06] Apparently it is.
[6592.06 → 6593.68] I think you have talked about that on Wine before.
[6593.74 → 6594.00] Okay.
[6594.20 → 6594.46] Okay.
[6598.06 → 6598.46] Guillotine?
[6598.94 → 6600.98] Do we make a fancy one?
[6601.18 → 6602.66] Do we rebrand to skin it?
[6602.96 → 6603.62] LTT store?
[6604.38 → 6605.40] We could live stream it.
[6606.08 → 6608.24] The end of the streak.
[6608.24 → 6612.62] They are our official skin partner.
[6614.38 → 6616.34] Oh, Geez.
[6616.58 → 6619.48] Am I doing anything that makes someone's life actively worse?
[6620.08 → 6621.70] That's where a lot of it comes down to me.
[6621.70 → 6623.94] You don't invest in real estate.
[6624.28 → 6626.74] You invest in business real estate.
[6626.94 → 6628.36] I always respect that about you.
[6628.42 → 6629.64] You're not buying up houses.
[6629.86 → 6630.64] But I do.
[6630.64 → 6637.40] I, I, but, okay, so if I, if I own two houses, but I literally give one of them to a relative
[6637.40 → 6639.22] to live in, am I evil?
[6640.00 → 6641.30] I think landlords are evil.
[6642.30 → 6644.80] Landscape, like, real estate prospector type people.
[6644.90 → 6645.08] Okay.
[6645.12 → 6647.28] Am I a landlord if I don't charge them?
[6648.08 → 6649.78] Or am I just a land guy?
[6649.78 → 6651.60] No, no, you're like, you're like, land bro.
[6651.98 → 6653.94] Land, land bro.
[6653.94 → 6656.36] We're putting your rent down this month.
[6656.46 → 6657.02] I'm sorry.
[6657.38 → 6658.78] I have to pay you now.
[6658.98 → 6659.88] Land, son.
[6660.14 → 6660.88] Land, son.
[6660.98 → 6661.48] I don't know.
[6661.56 → 6662.04] I don't know.
[6662.18 → 6662.84] It's, it's.
[6664.56 → 6667.84] I mean, this is a thing that's been debated for a bazillion year.
[6667.84 → 6673.54] In my opinion, it completely comes down to the, the, yeah, the oppression and neck stomping
[6673.54 → 6674.36] that happens.
[6675.36 → 6679.14] And if you're, you know, if you have your 400 acres, but you're doing it to grow crops
[6679.14 → 6682.18] that you're selling at fair prices that are not crushing anyone.
[6682.18 → 6686.80] You could argue that just having that much capital in general is bad.
[6686.92 → 6691.80] If it is impossible for anyone else to do farming because you will own all the farmland,
[6691.90 → 6694.00] Bill Gates, then yeah, I agree that that's bad.
[6694.12 → 6696.04] But there is a lot of land.
[6696.14 → 6701.08] Like if you have 400 acres in Canada, and you're not really close to the American border, who
[6701.08 → 6701.48] cares?
[6701.88 → 6706.16] Yeah, but what's stopping me with my vast amounts of wealth to just go to another country and
[6706.16 → 6708.14] buy up all of their stuff, right?
[6708.34 → 6709.82] But, but, but you didn't.
[6709.82 → 6711.74] So is it the power then?
[6712.18 → 6714.94] So back to what we're, what is, where's the line is?
[6715.00 → 6716.48] Is the line power?
[6716.72 → 6719.74] This is where we go to the ownership class versus the working class, right?
[6720.08 → 6721.64] But there are degrees of power.
[6721.80 → 6723.50] There are degrees of ownership class.
[6723.60 → 6726.20] And so where is the power line, right?
[6726.24 → 6729.72] If money's not a problem, how much control and power do you have, right?
[6730.02 → 6732.04] I think that should be the deciding factor, right?
[6732.04 → 6732.68] Poorly though.
[6732.68 → 6739.18] Now we're getting into the see, I don't understand the terms for what these different political
[6739.18 → 6744.24] and philosophical arguments are, but I'm going to call this the Superman discussion because
[6744.24 → 6747.26] good dude, tons of power, right?
[6747.26 → 6752.14] So I think there is, like I'm saying with this farmer, 400 acres, but not competitive 400
[6752.14 → 6754.12] acres that's growing crops and selling them at fair prices.
[6754.12 → 6755.42] That man should fight him.
[6757.68 → 6758.12] Yeah.
[6758.66 → 6761.08] Well, Batman should keep him in check.
[6761.40 → 6761.56] Yeah.
[6761.56 → 6767.62] You know, so like, I think, I think I would want to pay attention to that guy, but I, it's
[6767.62 → 6767.96] fine.
[6768.24 → 6769.08] People need crops.
[6769.52 → 6774.14] Sue for AWS asks, don't you still own the old Langley house also as a landlord?
[6774.88 → 6775.28] Yes.
[6775.72 → 6782.10] The only reason though, the only reason, the only reason is they asked me not to sell.
[6782.22 → 6783.02] That's three houses.
[6783.68 → 6785.84] They were going to, they were going to buy it.
[6785.84 → 6787.08] It's a lot of business property.
[6787.26 → 6787.60] Hold on.
[6787.82 → 6789.68] They were going to, they were going to buy it.
[6789.68 → 6790.38] That's a whole company.
[6790.38 → 6792.80] Hey, we said, there are a lot of things.
[6793.10 → 6793.54] Okay.
[6793.60 → 6794.24] Give me a sec.
[6794.36 → 6794.96] Pull the rope.
[6795.30 → 6802.64] We wanted to sell it because we weren't interested in, in, I philosophically, I am against speculative
[6802.64 → 6805.64] investment in residential real estate.
[6805.78 → 6807.62] I can verify that this all happened, by the way.
[6808.10 → 6809.36] We wanted to sell it.
[6809.66 → 6816.76] The tenants asked us not to, because they wanted to put together a plan to be the ones
[6816.76 → 6818.02] to buy it because they liked the house.
[6818.08 → 6819.74] They liked the area and it isn't.
[6819.74 → 6820.24] It's a nice house.
[6820.24 → 6822.00] I believe they even gave you a timeline.
[6822.46 → 6822.66] Yes.
[6823.60 → 6829.82] They ultimately were not able to do that and asked to renew their lease.
[6829.94 → 6832.80] Was it because of your oppressive landlord pricing?
[6833.06 → 6833.34] No.
[6833.86 → 6834.16] Okay.
[6834.96 → 6840.22] We gave them, uh, we gave them, I believe the same, don't quote me on this.
[6840.32 → 6844.42] I believe we gave them the same or a very similar rate to expand to the rest of the house once
[6844.42 → 6845.26] you moved out of the basement.
[6845.98 → 6848.18] And we have never increased their rent.
[6849.12 → 6849.52] Ever?
[6850.10 → 6851.18] They're never going to leave.
[6851.18 → 6851.44] So.
[6851.44 → 6861.14] Is there a is there a too nice?
[6861.14 → 6861.50] No.
[6861.50 → 6861.56] No.
[6861.56 → 6864.22] No, there's not.
[6864.36 → 6867.48] Is there a, well, this becomes the other argument too, right?
[6867.48 → 6867.88] When they move out.
[6868.34 → 6871.06] Nobody has enough money to be nice to everybody.
[6871.22 → 6874.28] Therefore, it is, you're being mean, right?
[6874.28 → 6879.20] You, you could just use your money to buy a swath of houses and then have everybody live in them
[6879.20 → 6879.98] for free.
[6880.12 → 6882.46] And it is just like, that wouldn't work either.
[6882.70 → 6883.74] Now we're making the town.
[6885.20 → 6885.64] Yeah.
[6887.72 → 6892.82] 400 acres of forest in Northern BC and then build a town and then have everybody live in
[6892.82 → 6893.10] everything.
[6893.10 → 6894.04] Comes back to line.
[6894.06 → 6897.04] You could even provide them clothing and like food.
[6897.04 → 6899.20] And you would know the clothing was made well.
[6899.44 → 6900.26] By us.
[6900.62 → 6904.88] I mean, the hypothetical people who lived in the town.
[6905.02 → 6907.76] You have my, you have my personal commitment.
[6908.08 → 6910.42] When they move out, we're going to sell it.
[6910.98 → 6912.10] I, I do not.
[6912.34 → 6918.22] I, I believe we have, we have a demand problem here for housing, but we also have a supply problem
[6918.22 → 6920.62] and I don't want to contribute to the supply problem.
[6921.30 → 6926.08] But I'm also, I'm also not into raising rents.
[6926.08 → 6927.92] I believe, I mean, we talked about this earlier on the show.
[6928.36 → 6930.52] To me, a contract is a contract.
[6930.52 → 6934.52] It's an agreement and unilaterally changing the agreement is pretty stupid.
[6935.00 → 6935.14] I think.
[6935.30 → 6937.28] What about things like, here's, here's a question.
[6937.28 → 6942.80] Like if, if the if there's natural inflation and things like power, hydro, do you pass power
[6942.80 → 6943.34] and hydro on?
[6943.60 → 6944.42] I have no idea.
[6944.58 → 6945.64] I'm not surprised.
[6947.04 → 6950.30] I, I bet you, you don't just because it would be like annoying.
[6950.54 → 6955.72] The truth is I actually just don't care about that asset.
[6955.72 → 6960.68] I think you're defending yourself and I don't think we need to cause you're like a good one.
[6960.90 → 6963.20] Maybe we will find out eventually.
[6963.44 → 6965.34] Is it possible for there to be a good one though?
[6965.40 → 6966.26] That's the question.
[6966.46 → 6967.62] But where is the power?
[6967.72 → 6969.06] I think there's got to be a limit.
[6969.38 → 6970.28] Where's the power line?
[6970.62 → 6975.06] Like Linus doesn't have enough money or enough power to be a concern.
[6975.64 → 6975.94] Right?
[6977.50 → 6978.18] Do I?
[6978.50 → 6978.84] You could.
[6979.38 → 6979.74] Who knows?
[6979.74 → 6981.18] I don't, I don't know what I could do.
[6981.24 → 6984.20] I've never really like, I've never really thought about it.
[6984.50 → 6988.98] I think, I think it becomes a problem when you have so much wealth that you can buy all
[6988.98 → 6990.60] of the onions in the U S.
[6990.66 → 6992.26] Oh, and like, I can't, do you know what I mean?
[6992.26 → 6993.78] Like you could destroy an economy.
[6993.90 → 6995.10] Like I can't buy politicians.
[6995.36 → 6996.36] You can't buy politicians.
[6996.76 → 6997.54] Well, maybe I could.
[6997.74 → 6998.84] I heard they're pretty cheap.
[6998.84 → 7002.18] I was going to say, I think you actually could be looking at some of the documentation that
[7002.18 → 7003.02] I've seen online.
[7003.14 → 7004.60] I think you could probably buy a few.
[7005.60 → 7008.86] They don't, this seems to be a relatively easy thing to do.
[7009.18 → 7009.96] I think so.
[7010.00 → 7011.06] They're really not that expensive.
[7011.30 → 7016.14] I'm not well-read enough on the subjects to like to give all the arguments.
[7016.38 → 7016.72] Okay.
[7017.16 → 7018.10] So hear me out.
[7020.72 → 7021.94] Please, please.
[7022.00 → 7022.30] Do it.
[7022.42 → 7026.22] Please, please, please, please, please.
[7026.34 → 7027.46] We'll put the guillotine away.
[7028.04 → 7030.02] This is, this is a really cool building.
[7030.14 → 7030.44] We'll dull the blade.
[7030.60 → 7030.82] Please.
[7030.82 → 7032.90] It has a really flexible zoning.
[7033.08 → 7034.08] This is sick.
[7034.36 → 7039.70] It allows for recreation use, office use, multi-unit residential use.
[7040.94 → 7041.70] For town!
[7041.86 → 7046.28] It has over 600 underground parking stalls.
[7046.50 → 7049.24] This building is the size of a city block.
[7050.02 → 7052.84] It allows for mixed retail use.
[7053.10 → 7054.28] So we could literally have like.
[7054.28 → 7054.84] We could have a store.
[7054.98 → 7057.96] We could have like a like an LTT tech shop.
[7057.96 → 7060.80] Um, where you could come get your computer repaired.
[7061.06 → 7063.30] Dude, get like, you know that tech mall in Taiwan?
[7063.64 → 7066.54] It is almost 250,000 square feet.
[7066.96 → 7067.02] Sick.
[7067.02 → 7072.34] It is literally larger than the entire real estate portfolio that I currently own combined.
[7072.46 → 7075.14] If it's 256,000 square feet, that would just be sick.
[7075.50 → 7081.96] The only problem, the only problem is that this is an infamous building.
[7081.96 → 7082.70] Oh.
[7082.88 → 7083.10] Oh.
[7083.62 → 7084.76] It was originally.
[7085.40 → 7086.64] Is it like haunted or something?
[7086.84 → 7087.44] Here we go.
[7089.42 → 7091.06] Vacant since 1998?
[7091.74 → 7092.72] Oh, let's do it.
[7093.68 → 7095.80] There's a really cool YouTube video.
[7096.14 → 7096.40] Ghost building.
[7096.40 → 7098.84] Where they go into it from a few years back.
[7099.00 → 7102.32] And this thing has f***ING rotted.
[7102.64 → 7102.98] Oh.
[7102.98 → 7106.42] It would be a nightmare.
[7106.76 → 7108.60] Moving vlogs for four years?
[7108.72 → 7110.16] Yeah, pretty much.
[7110.54 → 7110.98] Um.
[7111.28 → 7115.82] I'm going to get, I'm going to get mesothelioma for putting all the cat 16 in it.
[7116.18 → 7116.40] Yeah.
[7116.50 → 7117.34] Yeah, here it is though.
[7117.40 → 7119.86] It's right between Guildford and Surrey Central City.
[7119.98 → 7121.78] So it's like actually an amazing location.
[7121.78 → 7124.00] How is it allowed to just be abandoned this whole time?
[7124.32 → 7124.80] Wow.
[7124.80 → 7131.70] I heard a story that like an American investor showed up at a previous court ordered sale
[7131.70 → 7133.28] and bought it for like a song.
[7133.66 → 7135.74] Like a couple million dollars or something like that.
[7135.84 → 7137.08] And then just sat on it.
[7137.30 → 7138.08] And then sold it.
[7138.12 → 7142.18] I think it sold a couple of years ago again to someone who thought they could resurrect it.
[7142.70 → 7144.90] There's another court ordered sale coming.
[7145.48 → 7150.36] Clearly, clearly nobody can get this thing off the ground.
[7151.58 → 7153.10] They don't have a world-class team.
[7153.10 → 7155.72] You can pee on the floor.
[7156.02 → 7156.68] What if you, uh.
[7156.68 → 7158.30] Could have a whole stall for that.
[7158.48 → 7160.74] Could you like section off half the building?
[7161.16 → 7163.74] Or honestly, from the sounds of it, three quarters of the building?
[7164.72 → 7166.16] I think that the city is.
[7166.16 → 7167.20] And renovate part of it?
[7167.46 → 7172.78] I think that the city is highly motivated to have this not just be an eyesore on like
[7172.78 → 7174.42] one of the major arteries.
[7175.28 → 7175.72] Um.
[7176.44 → 7183.08] However, there would be serious like, like safety and building code concerns.
[7183.10 → 7185.94] Around any effort to resurrect this thing.
[7191.48 → 7192.92] I'm so sorry.
[7195.12 → 7196.14] Are you though?
[7196.86 → 7199.24] The Reddit is hilarious sometimes.
[7199.44 → 7201.24] I used to, I used to have problems with the Reddit.
[7201.36 → 7203.78] The Reddit has been hilarious for quite a while now.
[7203.78 → 7206.16] Oh man.
[7207.04 → 7208.32] That's hilarious.
[7211.32 → 7213.36] No, I need him to employ me.
[7214.56 → 7214.92] Yeah.
[7215.08 → 7215.76] Don't please.
[7216.12 → 7216.48] Um.
[7217.22 → 7217.78] All right.
[7219.08 → 7219.64] I don't know.
[7219.70 → 7225.10] I have a weird opinion that I think a lot of to eat the rich stuff has been, um, like
[7225.10 → 7226.30] rage.
[7226.30 → 7229.42] I don't know if we bleeped that word out or not, but I did anyway.
[7229.80 → 7230.16] Um.
[7230.28 → 7231.02] He said porn.
[7231.22 → 7231.40] Yeah.
[7231.40 → 7232.16] I guess we don't then.
[7232.30 → 7232.66] I don't know.
[7232.72 → 7233.28] Sometimes we do.
[7233.62 → 7234.54] I think it.
[7235.00 → 7235.66] Cause like.
[7236.60 → 7238.58] The amount you hear people say like.
[7239.54 → 7240.76] Oh, I'm gonna whatever.
[7241.14 → 7243.62] Like it's either that or it's that whole thing where like.
[7244.42 → 7247.46] You say you're going to do something, but then the second you say it, you're no longer
[7247.46 → 7248.24] really going to do it.
[7248.42 → 7251.16] So if you're going to really commit to things, you should just do it without talking about
[7251.16 → 7251.26] it.
[7251.26 → 7251.84] Oh, interesting.
[7251.96 → 7252.48] Apparently it is.
[7252.58 → 7253.84] I'm, I'm all about that now.
[7254.48 → 7255.58] So now he's not about it.
[7256.88 → 7257.24] Yeah.
[7257.24 → 7257.44] Yeah.
[7257.80 → 7259.16] I'm just going to quit now.
[7259.36 → 7260.90] Because I've already achieved my goal.
[7261.28 → 7261.48] Yeah.
[7262.08 → 7262.40] Yeah.
[7262.40 → 7264.44] Cause you get, you get the like social credit.
[7264.58 → 7265.36] Thinking about it.
[7265.46 → 7267.64] You get the social credit for saying you're going to do the thing.
[7267.74 → 7268.00] Right.
[7268.06 → 7269.48] And then it's like, you're satisfied.
[7269.48 → 7271.60] You get the you get the dopamine hit, and then you're done.
[7271.80 → 7271.94] Yeah.
[7272.08 → 7272.48] Interesting.
[7272.76 → 7273.02] Yeah.
[7274.28 → 7279.06] Like a lot of times, especially you should, you should start and then form the habit and
[7279.06 → 7280.48] then you can tell people that you should establish.
[7280.48 → 7282.34] But you should establish the habit first.
[7282.82 → 7283.10] Huh?
[7284.62 → 7286.12] No, I don't have a doomsday bunker.
[7286.56 → 7289.60] My goal is to live in harmony with the people around me and not need one.
[7291.26 → 7291.92] I hope.
[7293.14 → 7294.26] 600 car garage.
[7294.26 → 7294.34] Sick videos.
[7294.66 → 7296.50] 600 car garage doomsday bunker.
[7296.72 → 7297.10] Sick videos.
[7297.22 → 7300.14] If you did a doomsday, you know, you can drive EVs in a doomsday bunker.
[7304.06 → 7304.98] Oh man.
[7305.28 → 7305.98] Be pretty sick.
[7305.98 → 7306.48] Dude.
[7309.48 → 7314.48] Bill Randall, executive VP of the real estate company said he's been involved in the building
[7314.48 → 7317.10] for 20 years, dating back to previous owners.
[7317.66 → 7318.46] Reached Friday.
[7318.68 → 7323.50] He confirmed Basal as the current owner and list price of 63 million.
[7324.02 → 7324.98] Little rich for my blood.
[7324.98 → 7328.48] The important thing here is...
[7328.48 → 7331.16] You know how the Babbage Centre is like 99.8% done?
[7332.56 → 7333.84] Yeah, well...
[7333.84 → 7337.86] If you just abandon that project immediately and sell the whole building and then sell all
[7337.86 → 7342.48] your other buildings, all of them combined, then just...
[7342.48 → 7346.44] I don't...
[7346.44 → 7347.72] I still don't think we could afford it.
[7347.76 → 7348.42] And a bunch of debt.
[7348.48 → 7348.76] Who cares?
[7348.84 → 7349.02] Whatever.
[7349.02 → 7351.02] Well, yeah, because the actual...
[7351.02 → 7353.84] Because the problem is not the 63 million dollars.
[7354.12 → 7354.78] Like, we could get...
[7354.78 → 7355.34] We could get...
[7355.34 → 7355.86] We could...
[7355.86 → 7360.02] With our cash flow, with our assets, we could probably get loans.
[7360.14 → 7361.84] We could probably buy it.
[7363.32 → 7367.06] Because if we were going to occupy it, we would only need, I think, 10% down.
[7367.50 → 7369.80] Like, we could put together 6.3 million dollars.
[7369.92 → 7370.64] We'll do another...
[7370.64 → 7372.62] We'll do another Lime sale.
[7372.88 → 7375.00] Linus Inventory Management Experience sale.
[7375.14 → 7376.68] We'll raise a couple mid that way.
[7376.68 → 7379.18] Like, we could probably scrape it together.
[7380.32 → 7384.76] The problem is how much we're going to spend in renovations.
[7385.12 → 7389.72] And to my point earlier about, like, safety and building code, you can't just be, like,
[7390.36 → 7393.06] in their working while you're renovating it.
[7393.36 → 7394.08] You can't...
[7394.08 → 7395.42] Well, okay, you can get...
[7395.42 → 7397.06] I think you can if you do, like, seals and stuff.
[7398.54 → 7400.06] The plumbing is rotted out.
[7400.30 → 7401.10] Like, it's bad.
[7401.78 → 7403.00] It's real bad.
[7403.00 → 7403.36] Oof.
[7404.94 → 7405.38] And, yeah.
[7405.52 → 7405.84] Yeah.
[7406.28 → 7409.28] Minor says, home renovations are always on time and on budget.
[7409.54 → 7409.84] So, yeah.
[7409.86 → 7410.80] We would literally have...
[7410.80 → 7412.02] We'd have sold all of our buildings.
[7412.26 → 7417.30] We'd have nowhere to operate while we're, like, looking around going, okay, we're a bunch
[7417.30 → 7420.38] of, like, clothing designers and video production people.
[7421.18 → 7423.62] And now we're renovating a building.
[7423.82 → 7424.56] Like, it's just...
[7424.56 → 7425.16] COVID era.
[7425.28 → 7425.90] Work from home.
[7426.06 → 7427.76] March 30, 25.
[7427.76 → 7430.16] I don't think we could afford to fix it.
[7430.78 → 7431.72] That's the problem.
[7431.82 → 7434.80] Even if we could afford the building, I don't think we could afford to fix it.
[7436.54 → 7444.88] If we could work out a deal with the city where they would allow us to, you know, get
[7444.88 → 7450.62] a small part of it up to speed while we, like, tech Reno it or something over a span
[7450.62 → 7454.90] of, like you said, like four years, then I don't know.
[7455.80 → 7456.94] It would probably take more than four years.
[7457.16 → 7457.80] Yeah, probably.
[7457.96 → 7458.68] Yeah, it's...
[7458.68 → 7461.20] I was wrong about the size.
[7461.40 → 7463.60] It's 275,000 square feet.
[7463.62 → 7464.12] That's even bigger.
[7464.34 → 7469.16] So, this building we're in right now, including all the mezzanine spaces.
[7469.34 → 7472.12] Dude, but the amount of parking spots, you could have...
[7472.12 → 7475.76] With where it is and the amount of parking spots that there is, you could probably have
[7475.76 → 7478.70] an income stream just, like, renting out parking spots.
[7479.50 → 7480.46] No, no one would park there.
[7480.50 → 7480.80] 600.
[7481.12 → 7482.44] Isn't it right next to Guildford, you said?
[7482.44 → 7485.02] It's in between Guildford and Surrey Central.
[7485.64 → 7486.00] Oh.
[7486.18 → 7487.66] It's like in no man's land.
[7487.66 → 7492.50] It's like if someone wanted to shop at the Superstore and walk two blocks, then they could
[7492.50 → 7492.94] park it.
[7492.98 → 7494.44] They accept Superstore has their own parking.
[7494.56 → 7495.42] So, we got nothing!
[7497.90 → 7500.04] You just got to make that the happening place to be.
[7500.50 → 7501.14] Yeah, dude.
[7501.20 → 7501.66] This would be...
[7502.50 → 7505.24] By completely abandoning your badminton centre and rebuilding it from scratch.
[7505.32 → 7508.78] This would be tens of millions of dollars if you're lucky.
[7508.78 → 7510.16] And so, this is the problem.
[7510.48 → 7514.92] In an eight-page sales brochure posted online, Collier's noted that the 2024 BC assessment
[7514.92 → 7517.50] value was more than $114 million.
[7517.88 → 7520.20] The problem is that if you buy this thing at...
[7520.20 → 7520.56] What did I say?
[7520.62 → 7521.12] $63 million?
[7521.18 → 7521.28] Yeah.
[7521.30 → 7526.22] If you buy this thing at $63 million, and you spend $100 million renovating it, you're
[7526.22 → 7526.64] underwater.
[7526.64 → 7533.76] And I think that that is maybe not $100 million, but I do think that it is not unrealistic for
[7533.76 → 7540.60] anyone who buys this to potentially spend that kind of money fixing it.
[7540.96 → 7542.10] So, you could end up...
[7542.10 → 7542.82] Like...
[7542.82 → 7543.36] Okay.
[7543.70 → 7545.86] I had a somewhat...
[7545.86 → 7550.50] I had a pretty not serious conversation with Yvonne that was like, we should show up at
[7550.50 → 7553.88] the auction and offer like $2 million.
[7555.06 → 7560.92] Because if this thing is going to cost $100 million to renovate, then maybe it is actually
[7560.92 → 7562.16] worth nothing.
[7563.04 → 7566.86] Well, at a certain point, it's worth the knockdown value.
[7567.82 → 7568.70] Dude, knockdown...
[7568.70 → 7569.40] It would be worth the land.
[7569.80 → 7572.48] Oh, I don't know if the city would even allow you to do it, though.
[7572.48 → 7574.46] Like, you need a permit to knock down a building.
[7575.54 → 7576.62] And I think they...
[7576.62 → 7577.42] I think they...
[7577.42 → 7580.20] The city wants this thing to be a thing.
[7581.92 → 7582.44] Um...
[7582.44 → 7584.02] Yeah, this thing, dude.
[7584.10 → 7585.78] This thing is friggin' wild.
[7586.00 → 7586.76] Yeah, in 2021!
[7587.02 → 7588.50] 2021, there was a tour.
[7588.74 → 7590.02] There was a tour of the building.
[7590.88 → 7591.40] Um...
[7591.40 → 7592.46] Here, I'm gonna wait till this...
[7592.46 → 7593.82] I'm gonna wait till this ad finishes.
[7594.56 → 7595.56] Is that a form of ad block?
[7595.68 → 7596.28] Is that okay?
[7596.56 → 7597.18] Is that fine?
[7597.44 → 7599.78] By watching this, by showing this to the stream...
[7599.78 → 7601.98] By showing this to the stream, but not having them watch the ad...
[7601.98 → 7602.12] No.
[7602.24 → 7604.78] Did you just perform a form of piracy?
[7604.98 → 7605.94] There's an ad for Navigator.
[7606.14 → 7606.90] Was that...
[7606.90 → 7608.84] Whatever Black past media is.
[7609.02 → 7609.86] You all just...
[7609.86 → 7611.80] Everyone watching just engage in piracy.
[7611.96 → 7612.18] Nope.
[7612.48 → 7612.68] Yep.
[7612.84 → 7613.06] Nope.
[7613.34 → 7613.54] Yep.
[7613.60 → 7613.78] Nope.
[7613.86 → 7614.30] It's right here.
[7614.82 → 7615.22] There.
[7615.36 → 7615.54] Fine.
[7616.10 → 7616.46] Okay.
[7616.66 → 7617.20] So here we go.
[7617.92 → 7618.96] So here's the inside.
[7619.02 → 7621.02] It actually, like, looks pretty Reece.
[7621.14 → 7621.62] Oh, yeah.
[7621.66 → 7623.44] It's been vacant for more than two decades.
[7624.54 → 7626.00] I bet it smells lovely.
[7627.38 → 7627.90] But...
[7627.90 → 7628.46] Mini fragrances.
[7628.46 → 7629.46] If you kinda...
[7630.56 → 7631.56] They talk about it.
[7631.56 → 7632.40] They talk about it in the video.
[7632.52 → 7634.86] You kinda gotta dig a little deeper to, like...
[7634.86 → 7635.38] Like, no.
[7635.50 → 7636.96] This is, like, actually bad.
[7639.76 → 7642.12] Developers envisioned an Asian show mart.
[7642.92 → 7646.32] Surprisingly not, like, discoloured.
[7646.76 → 7648.94] That doesn't matter almost at all.
[7649.30 → 7650.20] But, yeah.
[7651.92 → 7652.74] What are those?
[7652.74 → 7655.02] I don't know, dude.
[7655.66 → 7656.22] Buy it.
[7656.54 → 7657.18] Then you get those.
[7658.02 → 7658.42] Yeah.
[7658.60 → 7659.24] Free table.
[7659.58 → 7659.84] Yeah.
[7660.38 → 7660.78] Yeah.
[7660.86 → 7661.60] That's huge, dude.
[7662.18 → 7665.02] Dude, the place is frickin' enormous.
[7666.30 → 7668.20] 275,000 square feet.
[7669.78 → 7671.66] Just, like, are things that look just, like, open.
[7671.80 → 7672.94] Here's a plywood thing.
[7673.06 → 7674.48] Did you say there was residential?
[7675.08 → 7677.24] It's zoned for multi-unit residential.
[7677.48 → 7678.32] How much residential?
[7679.28 → 7680.94] I think less than 60%.
[7680.94 → 7685.80] So it would still be a very substantial, potentially very substantial amount of residential.
[7686.16 → 7689.28] This could literally house the entire company.
[7689.40 → 7690.22] This is why I'm...
[7690.22 → 7692.64] And, like, every endeavour the company does.
[7693.04 → 7695.24] That was why I was, like...
[7695.24 → 7698.52] But, no.
[7698.70 → 7702.92] And, like, you don't do necessary company housing.
[7703.08 → 7707.72] You just have it as an option that is cheaper to the point where, like, you'd be kind of dumb to not do it.
[7707.72 → 7711.08] And then you don't do a necessary company store.
[7711.64 → 7715.62] But you have a store on the premises that sells clothing and food and everything that you need.
[7715.86 → 7718.90] And then you can pay Linus bucks at the store.
[7718.90 → 7722.56] And you earn Linus bucks for good conduct at work.
[7723.28 → 7727.22] Yeah, we can use the AI tracking to make sure that people are on task.
[7727.40 → 7727.62] Yeah.
[7728.08 → 7729.36] And behaving nice.
[7729.48 → 7733.78] Every ten lines of code, you get five Linus bucks.
[7734.64 → 7734.96] Yeah.
[7735.58 → 7737.10] And your weekly food ration.
[7737.52 → 7737.82] Yeah.
[7738.82 → 7739.34] Yeah.
[7739.90 → 7741.32] I like this idea.
[7741.58 → 7741.92] Yeah.
[7742.38 → 7743.40] It's a good idea.
[7743.72 → 7744.00] Yeah.
[7746.00 → 7747.90] Surrey Board of Trade says,
[7747.90 → 7749.72] they should just tear it down.
[7751.72 → 7752.28] That's what...
[7752.28 → 7752.46] Yeah.
[7753.44 → 7753.88] Sorry.
[7754.18 → 7756.10] CEO and president of the Surrey Board of Trade.
[7756.18 → 7756.76] That's the city.
[7757.02 → 7757.44] Surrey.
[7758.60 → 7759.04] All right.
[7759.16 → 7759.80] Well, anyway.
[7761.16 → 7762.16] Good luck, everybody.
[7762.36 → 7762.72] Oh, yeah.
[7762.80 → 7763.16] Okay.
[7763.18 → 7763.88] I didn't imagine it.
[7763.88 → 7768.56] American lawyer Donald Pitt, who helped launch the Phoenix Suns NBA basketball team decades ago,
[7768.62 → 7770.12] bought the building in the mid-2000s.
[7770.58 → 7772.14] Construction was completed at that time.
[7772.14 → 7778.22] Since then, prospective renters and or buyers have included Fraser Health, Simon Fraser University, and the RCMP,
[7778.58 → 7780.66] but all deals eventually didn't happen.
[7780.66 → 7787.22] Potential uses pitched for the building have included banquet hall, office space, homes, restaurants, bowling alley,
[7787.58 → 7790.82] even an auto sales lot on the ground floor, none of which ever materialized.
[7793.54 → 7794.48] Two million dollars.
[7795.10 → 7795.66] So who...
[7795.66 → 7796.32] It's my final offer.
[7796.44 → 7797.56] Who do you have to buy it from?
[7797.62 → 7799.04] Is it the city or is it the...
[7799.04 → 7803.60] It's the current owner who is Kuldeep Basal.
[7803.70 → 7804.94] But they're forced to sell it?
[7805.44 → 7807.60] It's a court-ordered sale, but I don't know what that means.
[7807.68 → 7809.96] This article is fascinating because it's like...
[7809.96 → 7811.42] It's kind of everything you need to know.
[7811.82 → 7815.64] The important thing here are the lenders and the owner, everyone, along with us,
[7815.68 → 7819.18] we're trying to work together to find a positive solution for the property, and this is the realtor.
[7819.64 → 7823.46] This is a bit of a positive spin on this, but there is equity in the building.
[7824.02 → 7825.98] You know, the mortgage holders are well protected.
[7826.14 → 7830.50] The court-ordered sale is not because there's a negative equity situation here.
[7830.50 → 7837.28] So negative equity would mean that it is worth less than the amount you owe on it, right?
[7837.42 → 7837.64] Yeah.
[7837.80 → 7838.36] Or like the...
[7838.36 → 7839.32] Than the total liability.
[7839.70 → 7841.92] But I also think that...
[7841.92 → 7843.62] I don't know if it's worth practically anything.
[7844.12 → 7846.08] I am not sure either.
[7846.08 → 7851.98] Because if you have to rip up all the plumbing and very likely all the electrical and potentially
[7851.98 → 7854.62] the walls and everything else...
[7854.62 → 7859.14] Also, I think you're paying a cool like million dollars a year in property taxes the entire
[7859.14 → 7860.28] time you hold this property.
[7860.50 → 7861.50] Yeah.
[7861.50 → 7862.50] Yeah.
[7862.50 → 7863.50] Yeah.
[7865.50 → 7865.94] Yeah.
[7866.12 → 7866.42] Yeah.
[7866.72 → 7868.32] Well, so it's probably not going to happen.
[7868.70 → 7868.96] Ever.
[7870.06 → 7870.74] But it'd be cool.
[7871.44 → 7872.18] It'd be pretty sick.
[7873.06 → 7874.22] Minus Media Campus.
[7875.14 → 7875.70] Yeah, do it.
[7877.72 → 7878.60] It's not my debt.
[7878.76 → 7879.20] Go for gold.
[7880.72 → 7881.12] Yeah.
[7882.30 → 7883.82] I mean, it's a cool building.
[7884.46 → 7885.44] It is very cool.
[7885.80 → 7885.94] Yeah.
[7885.94 → 7886.60] It looks neat.
[7886.90 → 7889.32] Imagine you could play soccer on the lawn in the front.
[7889.42 → 7890.12] Heck yeah, you could.
[7890.12 → 7890.90] Company activity.
[7891.06 → 7891.76] Heck yeah, you could.
[7891.90 → 7892.10] Why not?
[7892.10 → 7893.18] It's like half the size.
[7893.18 → 7894.10] Dude, look at all this class.
[7894.50 → 7898.02] You could do outdoor Abington on the lawn in front.
[7898.10 → 7898.84] Look at all these windows.
[7899.56 → 7901.62] It's like kind of cool building.
[7901.80 → 7904.36] Why not every single person has a corner office?
[7904.90 → 7905.18] Yeah.
[7905.70 → 7905.92] Right?
[7906.00 → 7906.74] Look at all these corners.
[7906.86 → 7907.50] There are a lot of corners.
[7907.66 → 7908.02] It's beautiful.
[7908.02 → 7910.64] What are we doing right now?
[7910.74 → 7911.54] What are we talking about?
[7911.60 → 7912.46] How do we end up on this?
[7912.46 → 7913.86] Luke has 14 minutes.
[7914.40 → 7914.90] Oh, yeah.
[7915.12 → 7915.28] Luke.
[7915.42 → 7915.90] Oh, man.
[7916.06 → 7916.64] Oh, man.
[7917.34 → 7917.82] Okay.
[7917.82 → 7919.96] Nintendo.
[7919.96 → 7924.78] I killed the Ruben X Switch emulator last weekend.
[7924.92 → 7925.90] Russ of the YouTube channel.
[7926.04 → 7926.30] Oh, wait.
[7926.64 → 7931.54] No, this is about the copyright strike for Russ from Retro Game Corps.
[7931.98 → 7932.60] That is...
[7932.60 → 7933.52] Yeah.
[7934.00 → 7935.26] Thanks, Nintendo, for that.
[7935.40 → 7939.36] They got their first strike after covering the MIG Switch, now called the MIG Flash,
[7939.66 → 7942.10] which allows you to dump games from your Nintendo Switch to your computer.
[7942.76 → 7948.68] According to Russ, Nintendo was able to strike that video because the title screen of Super Mario 3D World was shown on his computer.
[7949.32 → 7953.70] The new strike was on a video where Russ apparently demonstrated a Wii U emulator.
[7953.92 → 7960.00] It's perhaps worth noting that you can't buy Wii U games from Nintendo anymore since the company shut down the console's shop last year.
[7960.00 → 7969.16] Then this Tuesday, it came out that Nintendo Switch emulator Ruben X has been wiped out a year after rival emulator You was shuttered by Nintendo.
[7969.58 → 7983.16] According to the Ruben X development team member RipinPeriPeri, the lead developer GDK Chan was offered an agreement by Nintendo to stop working on the project and remove the organization as well as all related assets.
[7983.58 → 7989.98] While GDK Chan didn't tell the team whether he was complying, the emulator is now gone from GitHub and the official site's download page.
[7990.00 → 7991.42] It has been wiped.
[7991.78 → 8004.42] It is speculated that this was a buyout rather than any kind of threat of legal action because my understanding of Ruben X was that it involved complete reverse engineering, not any Nintendo IP,
[8005.36 → 8009.18] which was supposed to keep it safe from any Nintendo legal action.
[8009.46 → 8009.86] Interesting.
[8009.86 → 8015.28] Um, I don't know if any of the rest of this matters that much.
[8015.32 → 8018.12] So maybe we should do a couple more merch messages.
[8018.60 → 8018.88] Sure.
[8019.56 → 8021.04] Well, we've got to do when after dark.
[8021.46 → 8021.72] Yeah.
[8022.42 → 8025.54] That way we can at least transition to when after dark before Luke just leaves.
[8026.32 → 8026.64] Yeah.
[8026.96 → 8027.28] Sure.
[8027.64 → 8029.16] Um, I'll focus on Luke once.
[8029.38 → 8034.88] Luke, did you or have you considered using the Flutter framework for Float plane?
[8034.88 → 8038.88] It seems like it would work well to have a unified code base across platforms.
[8039.04 → 8041.16] We're not changing frameworks right now, my dude.
[8041.60 → 8044.62] Um, I haven't looked into it.
[8044.80 → 8052.02] If, if this was something that we were, you know, if we were making a platform from scratch,
[8052.06 → 8053.30] maybe we could look into stuff.
[8053.40 → 8055.44] But yeah, we're not, we're not doing that right now.
[8055.48 → 8055.76] Sorry.
[8055.76 → 8060.28] Uh, the chat is also very upset at this idea.
[8062.34 → 8063.04] I don't know.
[8063.96 → 8068.40] So dudes, hey, Linus, do you have any pictures of that sweet Suzuki you've been painting?
[8068.60 → 8070.38] And Luke, have you ever rode on the back of it?
[8072.24 → 8076.28] Dude, his weight sitting behind me up higher than me on a bike.
[8076.34 → 8076.90] We would tip.
[8077.22 → 8077.88] Oh, your bike.
[8077.98 → 8080.70] Yeah, we, we'd hit the first red light and just.
[8081.28 → 8084.94] You know, I, I rode on the back of a scooter that Dennis was driving in Taiwan.
[8085.76 → 8086.42] Me too.
[8086.60 → 8087.08] And we lived.
[8087.34 → 8087.36] Scary.
[8088.36 → 8090.74] Colton and I both rode with Dennis at the same time.
[8090.84 → 8090.94] Wow.
[8090.94 → 8091.70] It was pretty scary.
[8091.82 → 8092.90] That's basically a.
[8093.88 → 8094.78] Yeah, that's true.
[8096.12 → 8096.72] Let's see.
[8096.82 → 8099.26] One actual human or two homunculi.
[8099.90 → 8100.38] Um.
[8103.22 → 8104.56] No, I don't have any pictures.
[8104.80 → 8107.58] I have been completely stalled on that project.
[8107.78 → 8111.02] Uh, kind of demoralized by some of the, uh, setbacks.
[8111.42 → 8113.26] Um, I'm going to pick it up again.
[8113.36 → 8114.04] I really need to.
[8114.08 → 8114.50] It's been a long time.
[8114.50 → 8116.18] I really, I really need to pick it up again.
[8116.82 → 8117.42] I'll get it done.
[8118.92 → 8119.28] Yeah.
[8121.78 → 8122.20] All right.
[8122.20 → 8123.28] This is a bit hard here.
[8123.28 → 8125.58] The person who asked that just wants to know when we're getting the beard back.
[8126.04 → 8127.66] Phony Tony said in full plane chat.
[8128.02 → 8128.34] That is.
[8128.60 → 8129.00] Aw.
[8129.42 → 8130.30] It was kind of true.
[8131.12 → 8131.36] Yeah.
[8131.58 → 8132.08] That's fair.
[8132.22 → 8133.10] I want the beard back.
[8133.22 → 8134.14] I think, I think I'm ready.
[8134.48 → 8134.74] Yeah.
[8135.14 → 8135.40] Yep.
[8135.40 → 8136.72] Hey, DLL question for Luke.
[8136.72 → 8141.78] Any thoughts on Star Citizen charging $40 for the Atlas, essentially making a problem with
[8141.78 → 8144.76] loading cargo and selling a solution to the problem they made?
[8144.76 → 8151.28] I mean, I didn't know that was part of it.
[8151.72 → 8156.14] Um, because I didn't know about this ship because I check out Star Citizen like once a year.
[8156.88 → 8159.02] Um, I don't know, dude.
[8159.14 → 8164.58] They also sell like tens of thousands of dollars for a single ship, don't they?
[8165.52 → 8165.90] I don't know.
[8166.06 → 8166.70] The whole thing is...
[8166.70 → 8168.20] No, I don't think they have anything that expensive.
[8168.20 → 8168.60] Are you sure?
[8168.70 → 8169.62] I don't think so.
[8169.62 → 8170.14] Yeah, they do.
[8170.24 → 8170.98] I think so.
[8171.08 → 8171.48] They don't.
[8171.48 → 8173.96] I know they have packs that are that expensive.
[8174.02 → 8179.80] No, there's, there's a ship that is the like, largest luxury yacht.
[8180.46 → 8182.12] And I think it's five figures at least.
[8182.96 → 8183.38] Most expensive ships.
[8183.38 → 8184.18] Idris, is that it?
[8184.26 → 8184.28] Is that it?
[8185.20 → 8185.64] 2022.
[8188.66 → 8189.34] 725, blah.
[8189.36 → 8190.38] The Idris is old.
[8190.48 → 8190.88] That one.
[8191.28 → 8191.72] How much is that one?
[8191.72 → 8192.62] $25,000.
[8192.62 → 8195.22] $600,000, 600i Executive Edition.
[8195.36 → 8197.04] Hey, it's, that's...
[8197.04 → 8198.72] The Javelin is $3,000.
[8199.62 → 8201.44] Largest Destroyer Class ship.
[8202.18 → 8203.50] 480 meters in length.
[8203.70 → 8205.78] Yeah, but there's the 600i Executive Edition.
[8205.90 → 8207.12] Okay, 25 grand?
[8207.46 → 8207.68] Yeah.
[8207.96 → 8209.94] There's no way anybody bought that.
[8210.14 → 8212.06] Uh, I pretty much guarantee you someone did.
[8212.62 → 8213.24] Oh, yeah.
[8213.78 → 8217.34] For human use as an expeditionary vessel for players.
[8217.34 → 8225.64] No, for players, the ship is only available as a reward upon reaching the Legates Nation Concierge rank, which requires a spending...
[8225.64 → 8227.16] Oh, requires a spending of $25,000.
[8227.54 → 8227.80] Yes.
[8227.80 → 8229.58] So even though the ship cannot be...
[8229.58 → 8230.40] That's a rank for spending money.
[8230.42 → 8231.42] Oh, I see.
[8232.62 → 8234.98] That's a rank for spending money, my guy.
[8236.04 → 8236.46] Oh.
[8236.46 → 8243.76] The interior is in pre-concept stage design and will be updated at some point in the future.
[8244.12 → 8245.94] There's a VR Chat level for it.
[8246.82 → 8248.26] So you don't have to buy one.
[8249.16 → 8249.68] Ever.
[8250.74 → 8251.84] Like a normal person.
[8252.74 → 8253.52] Uh, moving on?
[8253.52 → 8255.28] So like, yeah, I don't know.
[8255.42 → 8256.36] Uh, that sucks.
[8256.70 → 8257.10] Uh.
[8258.06 → 8259.04] Star Citizen's cool, though.
[8259.64 → 8263.26] They do genuinely some pretty incredible things.
[8263.58 → 8265.18] The tech behind it is fascinating.
[8265.38 → 8266.74] What they're working on is super NATO.
[8269.06 → 8271.86] You don't have to spend that much money on the game at all.
[8272.32 → 8272.56] Oh, no.
[8272.64 → 8276.48] You can just play the game and earn money and then buy ships that way, and it's totally fine.
[8276.56 → 8281.46] I'm still working on my $60 ship buy since it first came out a thousand years ago.
[8281.58 → 8281.78] Yeah.
[8281.94 → 8283.00] And you're probably fine.
[8283.04 → 8283.32] Okay.
[8283.32 → 8288.06] Like this cargo ship thing, I wouldn't be surprised if you can just make some money in the game and just buy it in the game.
[8288.20 → 8288.34] Yep.
[8288.70 → 8288.92] Yeah.
[8288.98 → 8289.94] So like, I don't know.
[8290.16 → 8291.08] Just ignore it.
[8291.18 → 8293.28] Don't, don't play into those things and move on.
[8293.44 → 8295.72] Talking of games, have you played Zero Sievert?
[8296.58 → 8296.94] What?
[8297.22 → 8297.90] Okay, no.
[8298.56 → 8299.30] Uh, look, I don't know.
[8299.44 → 8299.60] Hey, hold on.
[8299.66 → 8301.36] Can we do something really fun, really quick here?
[8301.42 → 8301.74] Oh, yeah, sure.
[8301.82 → 8302.72] This is still a thing.
[8305.18 → 8307.34] There's a $50 Super Chat.
[8307.34 → 8308.10] Oh, and it's just gone?
[8309.06 → 8311.90] And I have to click here to see it.
[8311.90 → 8313.50] But they don't stay here forever.
[8314.44 → 8320.54] Um, pretty, pretty wild that it's just not in the viewer activity thing.
[8320.76 → 8322.28] This has been open the whole time.
[8322.90 → 8323.58] Whole time.
[8324.28 → 8324.80] Merch messages.
[8324.92 → 8325.62] Use merch messages.
[8326.12 → 8326.66] Okay, cool.
[8326.84 → 8326.94] Bye.
[8327.02 → 8330.66] Zero Sievert looks sick from just like the Steam page.
[8330.66 → 8332.86] But, I don't know.
[8333.64 → 8336.86] It's a it's an extraction shooter, but it's like a little top-down game.
[8337.04 → 8337.52] Oh, that's cool.
[8337.80 → 8339.84] I guess nuclear focused?
[8340.26 → 8340.98] Very positive.
[8341.34 → 8341.94] Yeah, I don't know.
[8342.04 → 8342.24] Cool.
[8342.42 → 8342.84] Seems neat.
[8343.70 → 8345.14] There are so many cool games these days.
[8347.00 → 8347.90] Sorry, one second.
[8348.46 → 8349.50] Oh, am I going back to your laptop?
[8350.50 → 8356.58] They call, they call the area Yakov, which is like the closest thing to Markov.
[8356.58 → 8358.46] All right.
[8358.84 → 8359.80] That's a little nuts.
[8359.98 → 8360.32] All right.
[8360.38 → 8360.76] All right.
[8360.84 → 8361.56] They know what they're doing.
[8362.24 → 8365.56] Luke, you've said in the past you wouldn't do an AMD tech upgrade.
[8365.66 → 8366.66] Is it be too boring?
[8367.02 → 8369.32] Would you do it with this big kicker?
[8369.72 → 8371.26] Linus is in charge and picks what you get.
[8371.26 → 8374.78] I already pick what he gets for his upgrades.
[8375.22 → 8376.64] Yeah, to be honest.
[8378.48 → 8385.70] No, I, my problem was that like, it just, I, yeah, I didn't have a an interesting, I actually
[8385.70 → 8386.74] said no at one point.
[8387.06 → 8390.00] One was offered to me and I said no, because I didn't think it would be interesting for
[8390.00 → 8390.28] people.
[8391.40 → 8397.76] That is no longer true, but I, I am at the whims of the rules of whoever draws the thing.
[8397.92 → 8399.84] So, I don't know if I'm eligible or not.
[8399.84 → 8401.92] It doesn't really necessarily matter.
[8402.10 → 8405.62] I get the free computers because of that ancient awesome deal anyway.
[8405.94 → 8410.54] So, I'm, something that could be kind of fun is you were mentioning my dad getting one.
[8410.70 → 8413.80] We could maybe do it that if I get drawn, it just goes to my dad.
[8413.86 → 8414.56] Yeah, why don't we do that?
[8415.56 → 8417.38] Something like that could be cool.
[8419.20 → 8425.04] And then, I don't know if if I, there's potential that I'm going to be dramatically changing
[8425.04 → 8429.48] my setup probably in the new year because my roommate moved out.
[8429.56 → 8433.24] So, we're going to be moving our desks into there and I could maybe drag Linus over to
[8433.24 → 8437.12] my house for that, and we could just like film it, but it wouldn't have to be an AMD tech upgrade.
[8437.12 → 8440.26] Oh, weird.
[8440.54 → 8442.86] The behaviour of the dashboard seems to have changed.
[8443.36 → 8449.04] Something was in curated that I wanted to uncrate so that I could type a response and then push to stream,
[8449.22 → 8453.22] but it seems to have gone straight to push to stream instead of giving me an opportunity to type a response.
[8453.38 → 8457.30] So, anonymous, I don't know anything really about the WordPress.org thing,
[8457.30 → 8471.28] but I will say that the whole, if you don't agree with this legal fight, take a buy out and then get out move seems like not perfect leadership is what I'll say about that.
[8471.30 → 8472.32] It should go back into incoming, no?
[8473.00 → 8474.72] That's what I thought, but it didn't seem to go there.
[8475.18 → 8475.66] That's fine.
[8475.70 → 8476.66] We can figure it out another time.
[8476.78 → 8476.90] Okay.
[8479.12 → 8479.54] All right.
[8479.56 → 8480.06] What else we got?
[8480.68 → 8483.16] You got any more topics or is this when after dark officially?
[8483.30 → 8484.62] It's officially when after dark.
[8484.70 → 8485.66] There are a couple more topics.
[8485.84 → 8486.30] I don't know.
[8487.30 → 8490.90] I don't have to leave exactly at eight.
[8494.82 → 8498.50] Redditors can't protest platform changes anymore.
[8498.72 → 8504.44] You have to send a request to take your Subreddit private.
[8505.14 → 8505.38] There.
[8505.76 → 8506.04] Okay.
[8506.08 → 8506.54] That's that.
[8507.88 → 8509.88] I think we talked about the Flappy Bird thing last week.
[8510.58 → 8513.04] Sketchy Game Dev announces a recovery plan and a new Kickstarter.
[8513.04 → 8520.54] So the background here is the day before was a hyped up multiplayer survival horror extraction shooter that was misleadingly advertised as an MMO.
[8520.54 → 8527.06] The game was very limited and technically flawed when it launched in December 2023 and was withdrawn from sale after just four days.
[8527.58 → 8538.86] The developer Fantastic also garnered controversy due to its alleged use of volunteer and severely underpaid labour and its alleged habit of fining employees as punishment for poor output.
[8538.86 → 8550.34] Now Fantastic has returned with a promise that it's changed its ways and a Kickstarter for $15,000 to develop a physics-based multiplayer co-op escape game called Escape Factory.
[8550.34 → 8552.40] A demo of the game is available on Steam.
[8552.70 → 8561.58] However, according to data miners, the game's assets are flipped Unity store items and its networking and matchmaking features are based on Unity demo code.
[8561.94 → 8563.28] So maybe don't buy it.
[8563.38 → 8563.54] Cool.
[8564.34 → 8564.70] All right.
[8564.80 → 8565.28] That's it.
[8566.50 → 8566.98] Okay.
[8566.98 → 8567.02] All right.
[8567.76 → 8569.88] Oh, we got to cut the Zuck shirt.
[8570.46 → 8571.06] Let's do that.
[8571.70 → 8572.56] Should we just do it next week?
[8572.98 → 8573.78] No, they need it.
[8573.96 → 8574.68] Oh, okay.
[8575.00 → 8579.80] It's time to unbox a $400 t-shirt.
[8580.02 → 8580.36] Oh, yeah.
[8580.58 → 8582.00] I'm excited.
[8582.12 → 8582.82] Would you like to do it?
[8583.54 → 8583.90] Sure.
[8584.40 → 8586.34] This is actually the second time it's unboxed.
[8586.62 → 8587.22] So, yeah.
[8587.34 → 8588.82] I unboxed it for a float plan exclusive.
[8589.00 → 8589.68] You get a little card.
[8589.76 → 8590.82] You got to read the card first.
[8590.92 → 8591.16] All right.
[8591.18 → 8591.76] I'll read the card.
[8592.68 → 8595.38] You can't open your present without reading the card first.
[8595.38 → 8597.98] Thank you for purchasing from our online boutique.
[8598.18 → 8601.48] We have prepared your order with the utmost care in Salome.
[8601.84 → 8602.32] Salome.
[8602.54 → 8603.48] I don't know.
[8603.62 → 8604.36] It's an Italian city.
[8605.24 → 8607.16] Our customer care is available to assist you.
[8607.56 → 8609.28] Scan the QR code to contact our team.
[8610.06 → 8610.78] Very nice.
[8610.92 → 8611.06] All right.
[8613.24 → 8613.98] Oh, man.
[8614.00 → 8615.04] I just cleaned the guillotine.
[8615.34 → 8615.50] Okay.
[8615.52 → 8615.86] Look.
[8616.38 → 8616.64] Look.
[8616.68 → 8617.92] I didn't buy it for myself.
[8619.14 → 8622.60] The company bought it for competitive product research.
[8622.76 → 8623.04] Yeah.
[8623.64 → 8625.28] And we're destroying it.
[8625.66 → 8627.32] So that we can research it.
[8628.28 → 8629.32] It comes in a bag.
[8629.40 → 8632.06] I mean, you can't figure out how a frog works without taking it apart.
[8633.38 → 8635.36] That's what they taught me in biology class.
[8635.68 → 8637.48] Why does it come to its own bag?
[8637.82 → 8639.04] So that you have a bag.
[8639.50 → 8639.82] Whoa.
[8640.16 → 8641.54] It doesn't even have a bag.
[8641.56 → 8642.58] You're not good at this.
[8643.84 → 8645.42] Is that surprising to anyone?
[8646.30 → 8646.62] Okay.
[8646.76 → 8649.44] It doesn't have a lot of experience unboxing any clothes.
[8649.44 → 8651.46] Have you never unboxed a $400 t-shirt?
[8651.76 → 8653.80] Usually my clothes just show up at my desk at work.
[8653.80 → 8654.78] You're holding it behind your laptop.
[8654.92 → 8656.38] You are actually the worst at this.
[8656.56 → 8658.88] It's got a big, huge tag.
[8659.04 → 8659.22] Yeah.
[8659.40 → 8659.92] And that's it.
[8659.94 → 8661.04] It feels like a shirt.
[8665.74 → 8668.30] Not even like a particularly thick one or anything.
[8668.56 → 8670.20] I'm just, I'm feeling like this.
[8670.48 → 8671.36] I'm pinched feeling it.
[8671.46 → 8671.82] I don't know.
[8671.82 → 8672.02] Okay.
[8674.96 → 8679.46] Dear customer, please be advised that the product cannot be returned if the security tag is removed.
[8679.70 → 8679.92] Okay.
[8680.52 → 8680.90] Do it.
[8682.62 → 8684.38] You held it under the table.
[8684.68 → 8684.90] Oh.
[8685.20 → 8685.60] Luke!
[8686.18 → 8686.58] Oh!
[8688.04 → 8689.84] You need showmanship classes.
[8689.96 → 8691.84] I think the content's better when you get mad, though.
[8693.30 → 8694.44] Hey, there's another tag.
[8695.66 → 8696.90] Does this one show how much it was?
[8697.20 → 8697.44] No.
[8697.44 → 8699.74] Why is there another tag?
[8699.84 → 8703.04] Oh, I guess I can try and find the I forget what the stupid thing is.
[8703.04 → 8709.10] This product of quality, this product of quality, fruit of our labour, is created in Solo Mid,
[8709.32 → 8712.38] a small medieval village at the gates of Assisi,
[8712.70 → 8716.26] where men and nature are still aware of the harmonious rhythm of time.
[8717.94 → 8718.34] Got a sec.
[8724.34 → 8725.60] So we're cutting this thing?
[8726.02 → 8726.24] Yep.
[8726.24 → 8726.30] Yep.
[8727.44 → 8731.64] Do you want to cut it in like a specific spot so it's still wearable by someone?
[8731.72 → 8732.14] Is that impossible?
[8732.34 → 8732.94] How big is the circle?
[8733.04 → 8733.52] It's pretty big.
[8733.72 → 8737.50] Yeah, no, you just, it's still wearable after you cut a circle out of it.
[8737.58 → 8739.12] I mean, you, dude, it's a $400 shirt.
[8739.14 → 8739.96] Do that, do the nipple.
[8739.96 → 8740.66] Someone would do it.
[8741.14 → 8741.68] Oh, yeah.
[8741.96 → 8742.32] Nice.
[8742.42 → 8742.62] Yeah.
[8743.16 → 8743.78] You want to, here.
[8744.88 → 8747.32] I don't actually, I don't actually see it.
[8748.40 → 8750.30] Um, I'm a little confused.
[8750.56 → 8752.62] Does it say anywhere what the product is?
[8752.66 → 8753.42] Like, do you have a label?
[8754.32 → 8755.14] Uh, one sec.
[8755.14 → 8755.70] Okay.
[8762.70 → 8763.06] Okay.
[8764.26 → 8765.26] It feels nice.
[8767.14 → 8768.22] Are you going to give me the label?
[8768.78 → 8769.84] No, that's just like...
[8769.84 → 8770.34] The label's there.
[8770.44 → 8771.00] You took the label.
[8771.00 → 8773.06] All right.
[8773.58 → 8773.96] All right.
[8774.06 → 8774.30] Okay.
[8774.34 → 8775.16] So what, what is it?
[8775.60 → 8779.20] This is a C8190 medium.
[8779.92 → 8780.06] Yeah.
[8780.06 → 8781.12] Like I didn't think...
[8781.76 → 8782.88] I didn't see anything more specific than that.
[8782.88 → 8783.74] I think that's a skew.
[8783.90 → 8784.18] Hold on.
[8784.20 → 8786.46] I think I can probably, I can probably search by that.
[8788.08 → 8788.44] Okay.
[8788.44 → 8789.64] So the little rubber disc.
[8789.64 → 8791.76] C8190.
[8792.48 → 8793.34] Is that going to work?
[8794.02 → 8796.20] Unfortunately, it seems we couldn't find any results for that.
[8796.50 → 8797.26] Uh, okay.
[8797.52 → 8799.40] Well, I can't, I can't find it anymore.
[8799.56 → 8802.20] I can't find it on their site, but we definitely ordered this.
[8802.30 → 8802.84] We bought it.
[8803.22 → 8805.36] And now, uh, okay.
[8805.54 → 8806.46] Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[8806.54 → 8811.94] So one of the things that we wanted to do is make sure that our Zuck t-shirt, which is
[8811.94 → 8815.62] just going to be a great t-shirt, but you know, comfortable or whatever, you know, like
[8815.62 → 8821.66] billionaires like, um, we wanted to make sure that it is pretty similar, at least we're
[8821.66 → 8824.24] not going to have the same source of cotton.
[8824.44 → 8827.02] We're not, we might even use a blend instead of 100% cotton.
[8827.02 → 8828.16] It's not going to be made the same way.
[8828.26 → 8828.36] Yeah.
[8828.42 → 8830.42] It's not going to be made in a medieval village.
[8830.72 → 8830.82] Yeah.
[8831.16 → 8836.00] It's a great t-shirt, and it's going to be inspired by, you know, that shirt Mark Zuckerberg
[8836.00 → 8836.64] is always wearing.
[8837.18 → 8840.94] Um, and in this shirt's defence, ignoring the price tag.
[8841.94 → 8842.54] It feels nice.
[8842.62 → 8843.04] It feels nice.
[8843.28 → 8848.78] Um, but one of the things that we need to do in order to determine how we can make a
[8848.78 → 8852.44] shirt like Zuck would wear is we need to figure out the weight of the fabric.
[8853.00 → 8858.14] And the best way to do that, I'm informed by Tatiana from the I don't know if she's
[8858.14 → 8861.74] really fashion team, but she works on the fashion team and also with the engineering team
[8861.74 → 8863.12] on like materials, essentially.
[8863.34 → 8867.00] The best way to do that is to use this thing.
[8867.00 → 8867.88] Oh, it's...
[8867.88 → 8869.50] What?
[8870.82 → 8871.88] Oh, then...
[8871.88 → 8872.86] Oh, did I do something wrong?
[8873.00 → 8874.64] No, I just had it all nicely lined up for you.
[8874.82 → 8875.06] Okay.
[8875.26 → 8880.76] The best way to do it is to use this thing, which basically goes onto a material and then
[8880.76 → 8886.58] has like a blade, and you spin this thing, and it like, it's, yeah, it's got kind of like
[8886.58 → 8887.44] a nasty little...
[8887.44 → 8888.04] Oh, there are four blades.
[8888.24 → 8888.34] Yeah.
[8888.54 → 8889.60] Nasty little blade thing in there.
[8889.68 → 8891.30] So you turn this thing in, and it cuts it.
[8891.74 → 8892.46] It cuts the fabric.
[8892.46 → 8897.44] That gives you a standard sized piece of the fabric and then you, you can determine the
[8897.44 → 8898.20] fabric weight.
[8898.40 → 8899.14] Well, you just stabbed it.
[8899.20 → 8899.88] You got to go around now.
[8900.14 → 8902.08] You got to keep pressure down the whole time.
[8902.16 → 8902.28] Yeah.
[8902.34 → 8902.42] Yeah.
[8902.52 → 8903.40] I'm trying.
[8903.84 → 8904.10] Okay.
[8904.16 → 8904.48] Here we go.
[8904.48 → 8910.70] You don't have to go crazy hard because you're just going to be cutting the rubber.
[8911.48 → 8911.68] Oh.
[8917.16 → 8921.22] Theoretically, there's four blades, so you should, you know, not have to go technically all the
[8921.22 → 8921.54] way around.
[8923.48 → 8924.24] Did we get it?
[8924.36 → 8924.74] All right.
[8924.80 → 8925.68] And here it is.
[8926.42 → 8926.78] Nice.
[8927.22 → 8929.14] Sorry, Brunel lo.
[8929.48 → 8930.08] Oh, where'd it go?
[8930.84 → 8931.94] It's now in the shirt.
[8932.18 → 8935.18] Oh, this isn't going to be Twitch, Twitch TV safe anymore.
[8935.38 → 8936.24] Well, that was the point.
[8937.36 → 8937.72] Really?
[8937.78 → 8939.06] To have a boob cut out?
[8939.24 → 8939.42] Yeah.
[8939.74 → 8940.24] Where'd it go?
[8940.62 → 8941.30] Where did it go?
[8941.44 → 8942.22] Titty window.
[8944.66 → 8946.68] Is it still like hung on by a thread or something?
[8948.92 → 8951.22] It's a high quality resilient shirt.
[8951.22 → 8953.94] It doesn't just come apart like some peasant shirt would.
[8954.26 → 8955.52] Where did it go?
[8956.78 → 8958.52] That's part of the vanishing fabric.
[8958.54 → 8959.92] Maybe it's in the thing?
[8960.46 → 8960.86] No.
[8961.06 → 8962.54] This is what you get for 400 bucks.
[8963.90 → 8964.94] Where the heck is it?
[8964.94 → 8965.54] What happened?
[8966.54 → 8967.98] I mean, it's not like we can't do it again.
[8968.10 → 8968.98] We have a lot of shirt.
[8970.86 → 8972.98] I have already flipped it inside out.
[8973.60 → 8974.46] I'm going in.
[8975.78 → 8976.18] What?
[8976.68 → 8978.12] This doesn't like to eat it.
[8978.20 → 8978.46] No.
[8980.36 → 8981.24] I saw it.
[8981.24 → 8982.18] It was hanging off.
[8982.18 → 8982.22] I saw it flop.
[8982.42 → 8982.64] Yeah.
[8982.82 → 8983.58] Where'd it go?
[8983.98 → 8984.58] Is it under?
[8984.68 → 8984.92] No.
[8984.92 → 8987.34] Are we idiots?
[8987.44 → 8988.94] Is chat going to tell us where it is?
[8989.22 → 8989.84] Under the rubber.
[8989.92 → 8991.40] No, it's not under the rubber, you guys.
[8991.48 → 8991.68] Look.
[8992.02 → 8992.32] Oh!
[8992.58 → 8993.58] How'd it get under the rubber?
[8993.78 → 8994.92] I have no idea.
[8995.64 → 8997.72] How the heck did it get under the rubber?
[8997.80 → 8999.06] That was like a magic trick.
[9003.38 → 9004.16] That's wild.
[9004.30 → 9004.96] I have no idea.
[9004.96 → 9008.18] All right.
[9008.36 → 9008.48] Oh.
[9008.90 → 9009.68] Wait, did they...
[9009.68 → 9011.64] Oh, did Tatiana also give us a scale?
[9012.00 → 9012.40] Yeah.
[9012.68 → 9013.42] Oh, that's awesome.
[9013.50 → 9015.64] So we're going to find out the fabric weight right now.
[9017.36 → 9020.44] Did she give you like the formula for how much the whatever?
[9021.32 → 9025.90] It's grams normally, and then it's GSM if you 10 exit, if I remember correctly.
[9026.36 → 9026.68] Okay.
[9026.90 → 9027.44] Wait, it's not zero.
[9028.24 → 9028.76] Tear it.
[9028.82 → 9029.16] Tear it.
[9029.74 → 9030.52] Okay, I'm going.
[9030.52 → 9030.84] Tear it.
[9030.90 → 9031.46] Oh, no.
[9031.56 → 9032.08] The other tear.
[9032.52 → 9033.00] Oh.
[9034.14 → 9035.06] Palm de tear.
[9035.10 → 9035.70] Where's the zero?
[9035.80 → 9036.32] Oh, here we go.
[9037.54 → 9038.04] Okay, are you good?
[9038.82 → 9039.08] Yep.
[9039.74 → 9039.98] Okay.
[9040.48 → 9041.12] Hold on.
[9041.30 → 9042.28] Why does it need a lid?
[9042.64 → 9042.82] Okay.
[9043.12 → 9043.92] I don't know.
[9044.06 → 9044.28] Air.
[9045.04 → 9045.30] Air.
[9045.76 → 9046.20] Air.
[9046.56 → 9048.66] It's a very sensitive, accurate scale.
[9048.92 → 9050.84] Oh, because of the air?
[9051.10 → 9052.00] Air currents.
[9052.64 → 9053.12] Oh.
[9053.70 → 9054.82] Is that 1.71?
[9055.42 → 9056.74] I don't know.
[9058.06 → 9058.50] Yeah.
[9059.28 → 9060.24] 1.71 grams.
[9060.24 → 9064.72] Okay, so 17.1 GSM?
[9064.82 → 9066.58] It shouldn't matter, but...
[9066.58 → 9068.06] Is that like a lot?
[9068.48 → 9069.44] I have no idea.
[9070.86 → 9071.30] Fabric.
[9071.44 → 9072.62] That doesn't sound like a lot.
[9072.68 → 9073.50] That doesn't sound right.
[9074.22 → 9077.38] Well, it doesn't feel super like thick or anything when you hold it.
[9078.00 → 9078.44] Oh, okay.
[9078.54 → 9082.22] No, 17 GSM seems like it could be a thing.
[9083.14 → 9083.62] Alibaba.
[9083.82 → 9085.54] 12 GSM non-woven fabric.
[9085.64 → 9086.08] Here we go.
[9087.28 → 9087.80] Okay, yeah.
[9087.80 → 9089.74] Those look like pretty like normal fabrics.
[9089.74 → 9091.98] Like you could make a shirt out of or something.
[9092.30 → 9094.58] Wait, you know, this is 140 GSM.
[9095.02 → 9095.12] What?
[9096.08 → 9096.52] Hold on.
[9096.56 → 9097.36] Is that just like a mat?
[9097.54 → 9098.76] No, this is fabric for t-shirts.
[9098.86 → 9099.12] Yeah, no.
[9099.24 → 9100.26] This can't be right.
[9100.66 → 9101.56] This can't be right.
[9102.70 → 9103.82] Grams times 100?
[9104.16 → 9104.96] Oh, is it times 100?
[9105.04 → 9106.70] If it's times 100, that would make more sense.
[9106.70 → 9107.74] I probably just forgot what she said.
[9107.80 → 9108.94] I'm sure she said the right thing.
[9108.94 → 9113.24] 170 GSM sounds a lot more like the range I was expecting.
[9113.24 → 9115.42] I don't know what GSM numbers normally are.
[9116.26 → 9117.30] Grams per square meter.
[9117.84 → 9118.28] No, I...
[9118.28 → 9118.64] Okay.
[9121.36 → 9121.76] Thanks.
[9122.28 → 9123.48] How much do you charge?
[9123.76 → 9127.38] If they just weigh it in grams, why do they bother change the number?
[9127.38 → 9128.38] Um...
[9128.38 → 9130.78] I don't know.
[9131.28 → 9131.60] Okay.
[9133.58 → 9134.28] I don't know.
[9134.68 → 9135.32] Uh, okay.
[9135.68 → 9136.28] What else are we...
[9136.28 → 9137.00] What are we talking about?
[9137.14 → 9137.44] Oh, yeah.
[9137.52 → 9137.68] It's...
[9137.68 → 9139.06] It's grams times 100.
[9139.26 → 9139.72] Okay, perfect.
[9139.82 → 9140.50] She's in the chat.
[9140.90 → 9141.48] Oh, oh.
[9141.66 → 9142.16] My bad.
[9142.34 → 9142.74] I forgot.
[9142.94 → 9143.52] I thought you said 10.
[9143.66 → 9144.06] That's my bad.
[9144.08 → 9144.58] No way.
[9144.66 → 9146.50] Her username is Material Girl.
[9146.70 → 9147.66] It's kind of...
[9147.66 → 9148.18] It's pretty good.
[9148.80 → 9149.56] I like it.
[9151.50 → 9155.64] I mean, we were living in a material world, so it makes sense that you would be a material
[9155.64 → 9155.86] girl.
[9155.86 → 9159.44] I took it off and put it back on again, and it said 16.9 or something.
[9159.64 → 9159.90] Okay.
[9160.18 → 9165.20] Well, we'll let Tatiana do it properly, because realistically, we can't be trusted, apparently.
[9165.38 → 9165.56] Yeah.
[9166.84 → 9167.12] Okay.
[9167.72 → 9169.36] Just lost the fabric sample.
[9169.78 → 9169.96] Okay.
[9170.30 → 9172.50] There's a question for her.
[9172.82 → 9173.26] Is 17...
[9173.26 → 9174.64] Does 17 sound high?
[9175.42 → 9175.82] 17?
[9176.12 → 9176.86] Or 170.
[9177.06 → 9177.40] No, no.
[9177.50 → 9178.50] That's probably about right.
[9178.80 → 9180.12] I can tell you the answer.
[9180.24 → 9182.56] No, like, is that a high GSM shirt?
[9182.84 → 9183.54] Not necessarily.
[9183.78 → 9184.12] Yeah, okay.
[9184.12 → 9185.10] It's, like, fine.
[9185.10 → 9185.66] Yeah.
[9185.80 → 9189.60] No, your observation that it's not a particularly, like, thick shirt.
[9189.86 → 9191.24] She says, no, that's pretty normal.
[9191.40 → 9191.48] Yeah.
[9191.48 → 9191.72] Okay.
[9192.80 → 9194.26] Workman says, put the shirt on.
[9195.66 → 9196.42] With the circle?
[9196.78 → 9197.14] All right.
[9197.42 → 9198.48] Want to do a merch message in the meantime?
[9198.72 → 9198.96] Sure.
[9199.98 → 9200.50] You got one, Dan?
[9200.88 → 9201.24] Yeah.
[9201.38 → 9201.80] I got a few.
[9202.40 → 9203.94] Shall we move to After Dark as well?
[9204.62 → 9204.88] Yeah.
[9204.88 → 9206.38] Let's see.
[9206.38 → 9207.34] Hello, WAN.DLL.
[9207.46 → 9208.18] Spout V2.
[9208.54 → 9213.78] I got a chance to meet both Jensen Huang and Lisa EU a few weeks ago.
[9214.26 → 9216.54] I froze and had nothing useful to say.
[9216.76 → 9220.56] What questions would you have asked each if given the chance?
[9220.56 → 9222.06] Jensen, definitely.
[9222.22 → 9224.30] What is the favourite?
[9224.48 → 9227.24] What is your favourite artistic piece on your stove?
[9228.28 → 9230.06] How do you properly pronounce Thai?
[9233.12 → 9233.68] Okay.
[9233.94 → 9234.98] Pick one.
[9235.08 → 9235.86] Pick a lame.
[9235.86 → 9238.44] You have to decide.
[9238.68 → 9239.76] Well, I feel like a billionaire.
[9240.24 → 9241.96] Oh, hey, it's not actually a problem.
[9242.10 → 9243.02] Yeah, this is perfect.
[9243.28 → 9243.50] Nice.
[9243.50 → 9244.06] We should do it.
[9244.06 → 9244.76] This is a statement.
[9245.12 → 9247.04] I actually feel like that is an artsy shirt.
[9247.16 → 9251.08] Look, if the whole point of buying a super...
[9251.08 → 9256.48] If the point of buying a super expensive article of clothing is that you can afford it and other
[9256.48 → 9261.90] people can't, then it should be an even bigger flex to destroy it.
[9262.34 → 9262.60] Yeah.
[9262.60 → 9267.08] And then be able to afford to destroy it, which other people can't.
[9267.76 → 9269.28] I'm just following their logic.
[9269.78 → 9273.00] I'm not really into the whole $400 t-shirt thing.
[9273.28 → 9275.24] Also, there's some kind of weird stuff about it.
[9275.66 → 9276.80] Do you notice the shoulders?
[9276.88 → 9277.68] It does seem to sit a little odd.
[9277.68 → 9279.92] Have a weird little peak.
[9280.20 → 9281.90] I think that might just be from it being pressed.
[9282.04 → 9282.80] I think that's just how it's...
[9282.80 → 9283.60] It might just be from it being pressed.
[9283.60 → 9287.18] Because there's a line all the way down your shoulder, which is almost certainly from it
[9287.18 → 9288.20] being folded for so long.
[9288.50 → 9289.10] Or pressed.
[9289.20 → 9291.80] You've got to draw a dollar sign in the middle of the circle.
[9291.80 → 9292.28] What?
[9292.36 → 9293.14] Like on my skin?
[9293.46 → 9295.62] No, I don't want silver Sharpe on my skin.
[9295.70 → 9296.40] No, I reject.
[9297.18 → 9299.14] You need a black one so it looks like a tattoo.
[9299.36 → 9299.88] Oh my God.
[9299.88 → 9301.36] And then it's a window to the tattoo.
[9301.38 → 9301.68] Yeah.
[9302.56 → 9304.90] And it's normally you'd have a window to your soul.
[9305.22 → 9306.92] So it shows a dollar sign because it's...
[9306.92 → 9308.20] It's a window to his heart.
[9308.44 → 9309.82] I will say this.
[9309.82 → 9316.54] You guys can see more detail about it in the Float plane exclusive if you're subscribed to
[9316.54 → 9316.92] Float plane.
[9317.62 → 9320.98] And realistically, if you were shopping for a shirt like this, you can afford to subscribe
[9320.98 → 9321.54] to Float plane.
[9322.82 → 9323.84] But the fit?
[9324.56 → 9325.52] It's not great.
[9326.38 → 9326.58] Yeah?
[9326.58 → 9328.40] It's like kind of okay.
[9328.46 → 9329.92] It's not that flattering in my opinion.
[9334.30 → 9335.24] The shoulders.
[9335.68 → 9339.64] It has kind of like a weird second artful seam at the bottom here.
[9339.64 → 9341.06] It comes really far down.
[9341.08 → 9341.96] Unnecessary seam.
[9342.22 → 9342.50] As well.
[9344.74 → 9347.20] You look at the way it like bunches if I lift my arms.
[9347.50 → 9347.78] Yeah.
[9347.78 → 9351.56] I have rejected garments that had better sleeves than this.
[9351.62 → 9355.28] Is some of this being impacted by the giant hole that we put in it?
[9355.30 → 9355.40] No.
[9355.66 → 9356.40] I like the hole.
[9357.42 → 9357.78] Yeah.
[9357.86 → 9358.62] The artful hole.
[9358.88 → 9359.10] Yeah.
[9359.28 → 9361.00] I think having an undershirt on that.
[9361.02 → 9363.20] The second seam on the back of the shoulder is weird.
[9363.74 → 9363.92] Yeah.
[9363.92 → 9364.56] That is odd.
[9365.80 → 9367.20] Are you guys going to do that then?
[9368.86 → 9369.44] Do what?
[9369.58 → 9371.52] Put a weird seam on the arm?
[9371.78 → 9372.14] Yeah.
[9372.18 → 9372.88] I guess we'd have to.
[9373.38 → 9373.74] Okay.
[9374.20 → 9374.40] Yeah.
[9374.46 → 9375.20] Well, it's the Zuck.
[9375.20 → 9378.74] I mean, the Steve had like a weird seam down the middle of it.
[9378.76 → 9382.20] Is this really like, is he, does he wear this shirt all the time right now?
[9382.50 → 9384.20] I don't know if he does right now, but I don't care.
[9385.02 → 9386.92] I mean, Steve Jobs doesn't wear that shirt right now.
[9387.22 → 9389.50] Because Zuckerberg has done a big like.
[9389.52 → 9389.78] Really?
[9389.82 → 9391.04] He's going to let me get away with that one?
[9391.68 → 9392.38] What did you say?
[9392.56 → 9394.82] I said Steve Jobs doesn't wear that shirt right now.
[9394.88 → 9395.90] Oh my goodness.
[9397.70 → 9400.58] Because Zuckerberg is, he's like all trendy now and stuff.
[9400.64 → 9401.28] He looks like this.
[9401.40 → 9401.80] That's okay.
[9401.80 → 9402.64] I know.
[9402.86 → 9403.80] But we're not going to do that.
[9403.80 → 9406.36] I'm so happy for him.
[9406.62 → 9411.92] And this shirt is apparently, he took some phrase that is like, you must be Caesar to
[9411.92 → 9413.10] rule or something in Latin.
[9413.18 → 9414.16] I don't remember exactly how it went.
[9414.22 → 9415.42] And he changed it to Zuck.
[9418.54 → 9420.62] Let me try to find the information on it.
[9420.74 → 9421.20] Give me one sec.
[9423.04 → 9425.04] Zuck has gone full hello fellow kids.
[9425.20 → 9425.86] Yeah, a little bit.
[9426.24 → 9428.04] Make an Elon girdle next.
[9428.04 → 9430.06] So he's pulling it off.
[9431.66 → 9432.90] An Elon girdle.
[9433.52 → 9433.90] Okay.
[9434.12 → 9434.48] Anyway.
[9437.24 → 9437.60] Yeah.
[9438.88 → 9440.50] Patch the hole with an LTT logo.
[9440.96 → 9441.18] Yeah.
[9441.26 → 9442.06] I could be down.
[9442.90 → 9444.18] Make that part of the shirt you sell.
[9444.64 → 9446.86] No, I don't think we'd put a giant LTT logo on the shirt.
[9446.86 → 9447.00] Okay.
[9447.00 → 9449.40] Apparently there was a phrase.
[9449.50 → 9453.74] I'm not going to be able to pronounce it correctly at all, which is like, Au Caesar, Au
[9453.74 → 9459.10] n'his, which means either a Caesar or nothing or simply all or nothing.
[9459.98 → 9463.18] The saying is indicative of grand ambition.
[9463.18 → 9468.76] And it was a personal motto of Italian Renaissance, Prince Caesar Borgia or whatever.
[9469.00 → 9474.42] And his shirt is the same thing, but he replaced Caesar with Zuck, and he made it himself.
[9474.68 → 9476.36] And that's, that's his shirt.
[9479.18 → 9480.34] You've got that.
[9480.40 → 9481.56] And you guys went with the gray one?
[9481.74 → 9481.90] Yeah.
[9482.26 → 9482.60] All right.
[9482.96 → 9483.80] It's more iconic.
[9484.32 → 9484.76] Is it?
[9484.88 → 9485.06] Yeah.
[9485.10 → 9486.00] He wore it for a long time.
[9486.12 → 9486.34] Okay.
[9486.56 → 9486.72] Yeah.
[9486.72 → 9487.94] The gray shirt is super iconic.
[9488.10 → 9489.14] I don't pay attention to him.
[9489.24 → 9489.46] Yeah.
[9489.62 → 9490.22] I don't blame you.
[9490.22 → 9491.34] Oh, it's this one.
[9491.34 → 9493.68] There are a lot of photos of this.
[9493.86 → 9493.98] Okay.
[9494.70 → 9495.04] Wow.
[9495.10 → 9496.30] He really does look like a robot.
[9496.30 → 9497.46] He looks so much better now.
[9497.48 → 9498.36] I'm so happy for him.
[9499.90 → 9500.26] Yeah.
[9500.26 → 9501.52] There was nowhere to go but up.
[9501.92 → 9502.52] I don't know.
[9502.66 → 9504.80] He looks like he's, he looks like Logan Paul.
[9505.74 → 9506.92] Like that's who he looks like.
[9506.94 → 9507.96] He's trying to dress like.
[9508.78 → 9510.56] It's going to make prime, but it's like the number.
[9510.56 → 9512.36] Because he's like a computer guy or something.
[9514.62 → 9515.78] This over this.
[9516.66 → 9517.74] I think it's a win.
[9518.04 → 9518.86] I think it's a win.
[9519.48 → 9519.86] Yeah.
[9519.86 → 9520.32] That's cool.
[9520.54 → 9520.78] Yeah.
[9520.78 → 9521.48] He's doing better.
[9521.62 → 9521.84] Yeah.
[9521.84 → 9524.32] The haircut was really problematic before.
[9525.40 → 9525.68] Yeah.
[9525.76 → 9528.70] It's like, I want to, can you accentuate my receding hairline?
[9530.46 → 9530.82] Yeah.
[9531.08 → 9533.14] It's like, that's what he told, or like my large forehead.
[9533.26 → 9534.38] I guess it's not even receding.
[9534.48 → 9535.74] It's just really, huge forehead.
[9535.80 → 9540.66] I think this has been good for Zuck and bad for the people because people have started liking
[9540.66 → 9541.32] him a lot.
[9542.38 → 9542.62] Hmm.
[9543.06 → 9543.46] And I think.
[9543.46 → 9543.62] Oh yeah.
[9543.64 → 9545.48] Do people just like, like Mark Zuckerberg now?
[9545.54 → 9546.00] I think so.
[9546.40 → 9546.76] Interesting.
[9547.04 → 9547.28] Yeah.
[9547.42 → 9548.62] So we're not going to eat him.
[9549.22 → 9549.54] Well.
[9549.54 → 9551.06] He seems like he'd be chewy anyway.
[9552.68 → 9553.20] Lizard meat.
[9553.40 → 9554.44] No, we got to smoke him.
[9554.48 → 9555.62] He's got those smoked meats.
[9557.00 → 9557.78] What was that?
[9557.98 → 9559.04] Smoke with those meats.
[9559.16 → 9560.06] Baby rays or whatever?
[9560.06 → 9560.64] I can't remember.
[9560.86 → 9562.24] It was a long time ago.
[9562.36 → 9563.52] Baby rays barbecue sauce.
[9563.60 → 9564.14] Something like that.
[9564.30 → 9564.98] Sweet baby rays.
[9565.02 → 9565.88] Sweet baby rays.
[9566.58 → 9566.78] Oh.
[9567.00 → 9568.26] Chat says they're still going to eat him.
[9568.30 → 9569.00] They just like him.
[9569.50 → 9569.80] Okay.
[9569.98 → 9570.28] Okay.
[9570.28 → 9571.66] So they like him, but they're going to eat him.
[9571.66 → 9572.44] So they'll shed a single tear.
[9572.44 → 9572.92] Yeah.
[9573.22 → 9573.66] Okay.
[9573.70 → 9574.38] That's interesting.
[9574.64 → 9574.90] Nice.
[9574.98 → 9576.04] How many tears do I get?
[9576.66 → 9577.58] Do I get more tears?
[9577.76 → 9578.72] Enough to salt the meat?
[9581.10 → 9581.62] All right.
[9581.68 → 9582.78] Pour some internet on it.
[9582.86 → 9583.88] It's got more than enough sodium.
[9584.12 → 9584.34] Yeah.
[9584.42 → 9584.56] Yeah.
[9584.56 → 9584.66] Yeah.
[9585.08 → 9585.70] All right.
[9586.08 → 9587.18] High dwell.
[9587.60 → 9596.22] Do you think AMD no longer doing high-end GPUs affect exclusivity AIB partners like XFX,
[9596.68 → 9597.84] PowerColor, and Sapphire?
[9597.84 → 9600.96] Could we see them reaching out to NVIDIA?
[9602.54 → 9603.02] No.
[9603.16 → 9603.72] I doubt it.
[9603.88 → 9608.44] PowerColor and Sapphire have been all AMD through much worse times than we're in now.
[9608.70 → 9608.92] Oh, yeah.
[9609.82 → 9612.86] And XFX, they made the move.
[9612.90 → 9618.34] They essentially pulled an VGA, except just instead of pulling out of the VGA market entirely,
[9618.48 → 9624.06] they were just like, we're not going to sell cards from the only chipset vendor that matters,
[9624.24 → 9627.30] and we're going to go to AMD and try to survive like that.
[9627.30 → 9633.26] I mean, they're still kicking, obviously, but AMD's done this before.
[9633.76 → 9639.48] For context, the rumour is that AMD's upcoming GPU family is not going to have a high-end,
[9639.62 → 9644.10] like a 900, you know, 80, 900 XTX or whatever.
[9644.36 → 9645.30] That'll kind of suck.
[9645.40 → 9646.12] They've done it before.
[9646.22 → 9649.66] Polaris, they didn't have a high-end product, and partners apparently survived.
[9649.76 → 9652.80] In fact, I think they gained market share during that time, so it might be okay.
[9653.24 → 9653.58] We'll see.
[9654.64 → 9655.44] Only time will tell.
[9655.44 → 9657.26] That'll suck because Intel's not doing it either.
[9657.96 → 9658.22] Yeah.
[9658.84 → 9661.52] So if you want high-end, you're going to pay the NVIDIA tax.
[9662.58 → 9662.94] Period.
[9663.34 → 9663.60] Sweet.
[9664.32 → 9665.12] You're getting some...
[9665.12 → 9666.26] Maybe we'll get an even cooler kitchen.
[9667.04 → 9667.22] Sorry.
[9667.30 → 9667.66] Go for it.
[9668.56 → 9669.52] We could have a second kitchen.
[9669.68 → 9670.08] Have you...
[9670.08 → 9671.16] You've seen his kitchen, right?
[9671.16 → 9671.56] I've seen the kitchen.
[9671.64 → 9672.36] Everyone's seen the kitchen.
[9672.38 → 9674.36] How can anyone ever get over that kitchen?
[9675.16 → 9675.48] I don't know.
[9675.52 → 9676.16] It's a nice kitchen.
[9676.26 → 9676.84] What do you want?
[9676.84 → 9685.16] Oh my goodness.
[9685.80 → 9687.86] Is that even that crazy of a kitchen?
[9688.52 → 9690.56] He's got a mural behind his stove.
[9690.62 → 9691.58] Yeah, he's got a mantle.
[9693.20 → 9693.48] Yeah.
[9693.66 → 9693.94] Okay.
[9693.98 → 9694.62] It's pretty crazy.
[9694.72 → 9695.00] I don't know.
[9695.00 → 9696.32] I never looked that close at it.
[9696.44 → 9697.42] Is that a wolf stove?
[9698.18 → 9698.62] I don't know.
[9698.66 → 9699.48] What's a wolf stove?
[9699.48 → 9700.50] Does he have a combi oven?
[9700.58 → 9702.68] If he doesn't have a combi oven, it's not a cool kitchen.
[9702.70 → 9703.04] What's a combi oven?
[9704.40 → 9705.68] Chad knows what a combi oven is.
[9705.78 → 9706.36] I don't know.
[9706.36 → 9708.40] How are you rich, and you don't have a combi oven?
[9708.40 → 9711.00] This is like one of 47 kitchens or something.
[9711.00 → 9712.38] I live in like a Mc Mansion.
[9712.50 → 9713.86] It's just a normal house, but big.
[9714.18 → 9719.26] I don't actually do like, you know, fireplace mantle on my stove.
[9719.64 → 9720.62] What defines a mansion?
[9721.38 → 9722.94] I think over 5,000 square feet.
[9723.70 → 9724.94] Why did it autofill kitchen?
[9724.94 → 9726.52] Why is it asking me my location?
[9726.94 → 9727.38] Stop!
[9728.54 → 9729.78] Combi oven is way more.
[9730.50 → 9731.80] Combi oven is life.
[9731.80 → 9736.20] Combi oven allows you to control humidity and temperature and has convection.
[9736.58 → 9737.52] Steam injection.
[9737.52 → 9738.52] I hate it when...
[9738.52 → 9739.66] You're making croissant.
[9740.06 → 9741.02] You have to have a combi oven.
[9741.02 → 9743.76] I look up for definition of a mansion, and it says a manor house.
[9743.94 → 9745.04] It's like, what does that mean?
[9745.34 → 9746.90] Yeah, well, it doesn't have a firm definition.
[9747.04 → 9747.46] That's why.
[9748.34 → 9748.96] Well, okay.
[9749.08 → 9752.12] Actually, the first definition is a large, impressive house.
[9754.22 → 9755.22] Nice mansion, bro.
[9756.04 → 9757.08] Look up Mc Mansion.
[9758.12 → 9758.90] That's just...
[9758.90 → 9759.86] That's not even a real thing.
[9759.86 → 9760.64] Oh, it's a real thing.
[9760.72 → 9761.50] That's 100% a thing.
[9763.34 → 9763.60] Eh.
[9765.20 → 9766.98] It's the McDonald's version of a mansion.
[9767.38 → 9768.12] They're, uh...
[9768.12 → 9770.24] They put up, like, entire...
[9770.24 → 9772.26] They're tasteless, right?
[9775.26 → 9777.00] Why would you say that about your own home?
[9777.02 → 9778.18] Because it's basic.
[9778.46 → 9780.42] It's lacking architectural integrity?
[9780.62 → 9781.56] Yeah, well, it's not...
[9781.56 → 9782.66] It's not like...
[9782.66 → 9784.88] Does your house lack architectural integrity, bro?
[9784.88 → 9787.54] Old money would look at my house and be like,
[9787.78 → 9790.74] does it even have any history?
[9791.30 → 9792.26] Like, it's not...
[9792.26 → 9794.02] It's just a giant house.
[9794.24 → 9796.88] It's a normal house, except it's big.
[9797.30 → 9799.66] I linked one of my favourite...
[9799.66 → 9800.48] Like, I don't know.
[9800.66 → 9802.00] Can we even say blogs anymore?
[9802.00 → 9803.20] Uh...
[9803.20 → 9803.78] This...
[9803.78 → 9807.06] This person basically goes through and explains why they suck.
[9807.54 → 9807.78] Uh...
[9807.78 → 9809.66] And there are some insane houses.
[9810.52 → 9811.46] Just...
[9811.46 → 9812.26] So...
[9812.26 → 9813.14] Badly thought through.
[9813.74 → 9814.46] I don't even know...
[9814.46 → 9815.28] I saw some.
[9815.36 → 9817.42] Dude, I don't even know a lot of the words on here.
[9817.96 → 9820.30] Inappropriate use of prairie mullions?
[9820.44 → 9821.06] What is that?
[9821.06 → 9823.22] So, I did architecture for a while.
[9823.42 → 9825.24] There's, like, so many weird...
[9825.24 → 9826.18] Weird turns.
[9827.62 → 9829.18] Can you zoom in a little bit?
[9830.78 → 9831.18] Uh...
[9834.60 → 9835.50] Piggy nose.
[9836.40 → 9837.32] Extremely stealth.
[9837.46 → 9838.56] Ahoy, piggy.
[9838.76 → 9839.28] What am I looking at?
[9839.28 → 9841.36] Oh, it's like a tiny little porthole wheel...
[9841.36 → 9843.56] A window that they put there for some reason.
[9845.00 → 9847.48] Dude, I saw some really weird houses when we were shopping.
[9847.48 → 9849.26] There's a lot of, um...
[9849.26 → 9849.56] In...
[9849.56 → 9850.58] In the...
[9850.58 → 9851.58] In the kind of...
[9851.58 → 9852.08] Look at the inside.
[9852.08 → 9853.42] Freakish where I live.
[9853.64 → 9857.12] There are a lot of houses that the owners clearly designed it.
[9857.58 → 9857.98] Oh, yeah.
[9857.98 → 9860.00] And you ended up with just some super weird stuff.
[9860.50 → 9861.74] Faced with sticks.
[9862.60 → 9864.40] Chopsticks machine with stuff on it.
[9865.98 → 9868.28] I'm not going to say what this looks like.
[9869.46 → 9870.58] I didn't even see that.
[9870.90 → 9871.42] I like that.
[9871.56 → 9872.02] Hell yeah.
[9874.40 → 9875.20] What is this?
[9875.24 → 9876.98] Is this Mc Mansion hell?
[9876.98 → 9877.98] Is this a whole site?
[9878.22 → 9878.42] Yeah.
[9878.42 → 9879.18] In Will Fodder.
[9880.72 → 9882.02] There are hundreds of these.
[9882.08 → 9882.88] They're so good.
[9885.98 → 9891.78] My rich friend in school had this dining set, but they covered everything in plastic protection,
[9891.94 → 9894.30] so this all seems strangely obscene to me.
[9896.64 → 9899.32] It's like money does not buy taste, right?
[9899.50 → 9899.82] Yeah.
[9900.68 → 9901.62] No, it really doesn't.
[9902.06 → 9903.28] How do you live in this?
[9904.22 → 9904.88] I don't know.
[9904.88 → 9906.50] I don't know.
[9906.50 → 9906.86] I don't.
[9906.92 → 9908.46] I'm so anti-clutter.
[9908.62 → 9909.26] I don't like clutter.
[9909.38 → 9911.00] I don't like stuff in my house that I don't use.
[9911.74 → 9914.08] And I hate, like, uncomfortable furniture and stuff.
[9914.22 → 9914.76] Like, I just don't.
[9914.78 → 9916.00] Look at how many shirts.
[9917.36 → 9918.84] Look at the tiered ceiling.
[9919.32 → 9920.62] With all the pot lights.
[9920.62 → 9920.94] Oh, yeah.
[9922.06 → 9925.40] And then the tiny little anemic fan right in the centre.
[9925.62 → 9928.08] They don't have carpets, but the...
[9928.08 → 9931.54] Or they don't have, like, wall-to-wall carpets, but they have carpets everywhere.
[9931.70 → 9932.70] So you're always on carpet anyway.
[9932.70 → 9933.12] Yeah, rugs.
[9934.86 → 9935.30] The rug.
[9936.76 → 9937.54] Thomasville chic.
[9942.54 → 9943.36] Oh, my God.
[9943.40 → 9944.98] That's such a depressing room.
[9945.56 → 9945.96] Yeah.
[9945.96 → 9949.44] This one seems okay.
[9949.44 → 9949.82] This one's nice.
[9949.96 → 9951.42] But all those plants are probably fake.
[9951.44 → 9954.96] But there's only one note on this room because it's actually kind of nice.
[9954.96 → 9955.96] Yeah, that looks actually...
[9955.96 → 9957.62] I'd sit and eat breakfast there for sure.
[9957.78 → 9958.76] Both of you are blocked.
[9960.96 → 9962.66] Duelling code dormers.
[9965.48 → 9965.96] Okay.
[9965.96 → 9971.36] I mean, honestly, most of what's funny about this is just the commentary.
[9971.70 → 9972.26] Like, I don't think...
[9972.26 → 9972.50] Oh, yeah.
[9972.58 → 9975.44] No, the commentary's great, but these houses are also ridiculous.
[9976.40 → 9977.00] You know what?
[9977.00 → 9978.16] We need more chairs.
[9981.80 → 9985.00] Okay, is it a Vox Media thing, or is that just like...
[9985.00 → 9985.48] Well, okay.
[9985.58 → 9987.98] Like, big ships have round windows.
[9988.38 → 9990.14] Soul patch final bonds.
[9990.14 → 9998.54] All right.
[9998.70 → 10000.76] Bigger than the house my apartment is in.
[10001.48 → 10002.48] Just the garage.
[10003.90 → 10004.44] All right.
[10004.52 → 10004.82] Okay.
[10004.94 → 10005.26] All right.
[10005.32 → 10005.66] All right.
[10006.62 → 10007.98] The loneliest table.
[10009.22 → 10010.04] Yeah, dude.
[10010.08 → 10011.00] That's a classic.
[10011.00 → 10011.28] Dude.
[10011.94 → 10015.78] Giant houses that just have furniture that you're not using at all.
[10017.46 → 10019.52] Half the cost seems to be buying the house,
[10019.52 → 10023.86] and the other half of the cost seems to be buying ostentatious furniture to occupy it.
[10023.86 → 10023.88] Oh, yeah.
[10023.88 → 10026.48] Look how rich I am to afford this much nothing.
[10027.14 → 10031.76] I'm like, you take the badminton centre and then just put like a one Games chair in it.
[10032.52 → 10033.38] Ideal living room.
[10034.50 → 10035.42] Oh, no.
[10036.84 → 10037.80] More concrete, though.
[10037.90 → 10038.22] All right.
[10038.28 → 10039.08] You put walls on it.
[10039.16 → 10039.62] Hit me, Dan.
[10040.00 → 10041.52] Yo, getting some new lids.
[10041.68 → 10043.94] I loved the live demo from last week.
[10044.06 → 10045.16] That's why I bought these.
[10045.72 → 10047.36] Question for Mr. Lime.
[10047.36 → 10051.04] What was the driving force for you to start at NCI?
[10051.24 → 10057.84] I just really hated school, and I really hated the job running the painting business,
[10057.84 → 10062.50] and I just was so burnt out and down.
[10062.78 → 10065.50] Having a trash job is a perfect motivator.
[10065.78 → 10066.02] Yeah.
[10066.10 → 10067.96] Well, it paid well.
[10068.10 → 10072.58] Having and needing a job that you hate is a pretty good motivator to do something else.
[10072.58 → 10074.58] And so I was just like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[10074.76 → 10078.60] I just want to do what I want to do, which is talk to people about technology and get paid for it.
[10079.16 → 10084.78] What I really wanted to do was work in the tech room, but they wanted me in sales, which probably was wise.
[10086.10 → 10086.84] Hey, WAN.DL.
[10086.88 → 10088.18] I have a question for Linus.
[10088.70 → 10091.82] Do you see Mira on the big screen beyond?
[10092.34 → 10092.96] Did you see?
[10092.96 → 10097.40] I did when I got mine, and it was quite visible on mine.
[10097.56 → 10101.78] So I ended up returning it and going for the PSVR2.
[10102.98 → 10103.38] Mira?
[10103.66 → 10106.92] I thought this was a thing, but I think it seems like it's an issue with it.
[10108.50 → 10109.34] Mira effect.
[10109.40 → 10112.46] I'm actually not familiar with the term.
[10112.84 → 10113.40] Moiré?
[10114.06 → 10114.32] Yeah.
[10114.38 → 10115.76] Do you mean, yeah.
[10115.92 → 10117.54] M-O-R-I-E?
[10118.04 → 10118.88] Like when I wear my...
[10118.88 → 10122.22] It looks like a fine grainy mesh that covers the entire screen.
[10122.34 → 10127.28] It stays static as the image moves behind it, usually more obvious in dim scenes.
[10130.30 → 10135.24] I can't say that I observed that.
[10135.46 → 10136.40] Screen door effect?
[10136.78 → 10137.78] I think it's the screen door.
[10139.04 → 10140.16] But why would you just...
[10140.16 → 10140.66] It is more...
[10140.66 → 10142.78] Why would you not just call it screen door effect?
[10142.78 → 10143.48] I don't know.
[10144.54 → 10145.06] Oh, okay.
[10145.16 → 10146.54] Mira just means screen door effect.
[10146.54 → 10150.56] No, I didn't find that it was bad on that particular one.
[10150.64 → 10157.96] I mean, anything looks bad compared to the Vision Pro at this point, but the Vision Pro's utility is so limited that it's...
[10157.96 → 10164.78] I'm just kind of waiting for Apple's displays to make their way into other headsets, and then I can have the best of both worlds.
[10164.90 → 10168.28] I can have an actual usable headset that has a really nice screen on it.
[10168.54 → 10168.70] Yeah.
[10168.80 → 10170.08] I didn't know the screen door had a name.
[10170.16 → 10170.72] That's pretty cool.
[10170.92 → 10171.14] Yeah.
[10171.18 → 10172.38] I didn't know that either, so now I know.
[10172.38 → 10172.64] Me neither.
[10173.00 → 10174.76] PSVR2 for PC looks pretty sick, though.
[10174.90 → 10175.86] Good choice, Anonymous.
[10176.54 → 10179.78] And last, Curator, I've got for you.
[10179.94 → 10181.90] Linus, I want to ask you as a question.
[10182.92 → 10191.58] Have you, as someone who was born before the internet, have you seen an increase in general hysteria due to technology changing parts of our lives so rapidly?
[10191.90 → 10194.08] That is a measured and objective thing that has happened.
[10194.28 → 10199.38] It's hard for me to observe it, though, because before the internet was widespread, I was 10.
[10200.20 → 10201.92] I wasn't paying attention to hysteria.
[10202.02 → 10202.42] Fair enough.
[10202.42 → 10205.38] And we definitely, like, had hysteria.
[10205.66 → 10210.70] I think you can map it on even stages of the internet, like web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
[10210.78 → 10211.68] Yeah, I think that's fair.
[10212.12 → 10213.50] I think that has happened as well.
[10215.08 → 10216.08] You know what else has happened?
[10216.34 → 10217.06] The end of the show.
[10217.82 → 10219.14] We will see you again next week.
[10219.90 → 10220.66] Same bad time.
[10221.94 → 10222.24] Wait.
[10222.24 → 10227.40] Oh, hey, thanks, Audi.
[10228.82 → 10229.52] Same bad channel.
[10230.44 → 10230.80] Okay.
[10231.08 → 10231.54] Bye.
[10243.62 → 10244.70] Bye.
[10244.86 → 10245.06] Bye.
[10245.06 → 10245.78] Bye.
[10245.78 → 10246.24] Bye.
[10246.24 → 10247.32] Bye.
[10247.32 → 10247.88] Bye.
[10247.90 → 10248.42] Bye.
[10248.48 → 10249.02] Ciao.
[10249.12 → 10249.30] Bye.
[10250.50 → 10251.82] Bye.
[10251.82 → 10252.22] Bye.
[10252.22 → 10262.22] Well, it's not ready yet.
[10263.08 → 10263.72] It's not going up.
