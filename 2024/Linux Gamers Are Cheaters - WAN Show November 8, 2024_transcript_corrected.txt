[0.62 → 7.70] What's up you all welcome to the WAN show it's been a great week no it's been a great week
[8.56 → 13.76] Nope, and it's going to be a great WAN show. Oh, I wasn't even talking about like world events
[15.70 → 20.80] I realize what that probably sounded like now. I wasn't trying. I'm not even we're not even going down that road
[20.80 → 24.84] Wow, it took us it took us exactly three seconds
[25.98 → 27.98] three seconds
[27.98 → 30.94] To alienate some half of America
[30.94 → 33.74] I wasn't even talking about, and we don't even know which one it is
[35.46 → 40.98] Way to go Luke. I was talking about completely not American things. Okay, I will
[41.98 → 46.46] Nothing to do with America. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[46.46 → 54.38] I forget what the headline one was so Luke might get it for a change AMD is a rocketing upward they have
[54.38 → 60.34] Wow, okay, well we'll get into the details later, but yeah, that is absolutely incredible
[61.30 → 66.54] EA has ditched support for Linux in Apex Legends
[67.18 → 68.38] citing
[68.38 → 72.70] The fact that Linux gamers are far more likely to cheat
[74.94 → 80.38] Them some fighting words yoik what else we got this week a fodder has made DIY
[81.18 → 86.94] Upgradable Mac storage, okay, this is so cool. This is legitimately crazy prices
[86.94 → 91.66] We were talking about might not be so bad actually there's a little more to that as well
[91.90 → 93.90] We'll get to it intriguing
[93.90 → 101.34] The last one I will bring up is that MS Paint might be like a cool neat thing to do on your computer again
[102.06 → 103.26] Really?
[103.26 → 107.18] Maybe they're bringing AI features. They must paint and notepad
[107.18 → 132.06] The show is brought to you today by thingies. Oh, cool. Oh, see sonic notion
[132.06 → 138.78] Oh, and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our wrap partner brand okay
[139.74 → 141.98] Small aside. Have you seen my car yet?
[142.54 → 144.70] Not in person. I've seen pictures though
[145.58 → 149.74] My goodness, okay, anyway, that's all I'll say about me when you get pulled over
[150.22 → 153.82] EA is dropping Linux support for Apex Legends
[154.70 → 161.42] Despite the fact that the game was in the top 50 in terms of popularity on the steam deck over the past year
[162.14 → 168.38] According to Ea developers, it is much harder to catch Linux based cheaters and the quote is
[169.02 → 173.98] The openness of the Linux operating systems make it an attractive
[174.94 → 181.90] The openness of the Linux operating systems whatever make it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers
[182.46 → 188.94] They claim that the impact of Linux cheaters was having an outsized impact on other players experience
[188.94 → 193.90] And thus Ea has decided it is not worth supporting the platform
[193.90 → 199.18] I suspect if I'm reading between the lines accurately. I suspect this might also mean that the player base
[200.14 → 203.26] Playing on Linux is probably not super high either
[203.26 → 208.46] But it's very interesting to me that they specifically call out the outsized impact
[208.46 → 213.74] Yes, that that small player base is having because the player base can't be that small if you're a top 50 game
[213.74 → 220.30] I mean it might not register for a company like Ea and one of their halo titles like Apex Legends, which
[220.94 → 225.26] Okay, it's not a halo title. That would be haloed, but you get what I mean
[228.78 → 229.82] Do it oh
[229.82 → 238.86] He wasn't paying enough attention what he wasn't paying enough attention. Oh, forget it. Get on the ball Dan. I was responding to a horrific merch message. Oh, oh
[239.50 → 239.82] uh
[240.70 → 247.10] Well, cool. I guess we'll get to that later. Okay. Anyway, the point is we've got a few discussion questions here
[247.10 → 253.02] And I'm I'm legitimately interested to hear not just Luke's perspective, but I'd like to hear your guy's perspectives as well
[253.02 → 259.66] Like if there's anyone who works in game development particularly an anti-cheat development feel free to drop that into the float plane chat
[259.66 → 261.90] I'm going to kind of keep an eye out for it. But you know
[261.90 → 266.30] The first question is wouldn't more cheat makers be attracted to windows
[266.30 → 272.70] Seeing as the paid cheat industry is kind of an enormous industry these days and windows is
[273.98 → 280.86] Obviously going to be the platform of choice for most gamers. That's where your biggest player base is if it's a premium thing though
[281.90 → 285.74] Like the know, you have a less likeliness of getting caught if you use this one
[286.30 → 288.30] We are the premium specialized tool
[289.02 → 295.02] The discerning cheater. I very much suspect that it is but do you really think that it was that it is
[295.42 → 298.86] More worth it arch during the day cheating at Apex Legends at night
[299.18 → 303.82] Do you really think that it's more worth it to kind of jump through whatever hoops?
[303.82 → 309.34] You might have to jump through to become a Linux gamer, you know figure out installing Linux for yourself
[309.34 → 310.38] Which to be clear?
[310.38 → 314.46] I'm not I'm not talking about you guys right now. You guys know how to you know
[314.86 → 319.82] Use Rufus and make an USB drive and install an operating system on your computer on it
[320.06 → 322.06] Yeah, exactly, exactly
[322.06 → 326.94] I mean surely that wouldn't cause the system to immediately brick you did you ever see that video?
[327.58 → 329.58] I did nothing wrong
[330.06 → 336.54] Except where it tells you that it's going to break no, no different video. Oh, there's a short circuit where I unbox a Linux laptop
[336.54 → 341.26] I install steam on it. I did nothing
[341.26 → 345.50] I just installed steam on it, and then it just wouldn't boot up again
[347.26 → 348.38] No, I don't think I've seen that
[348.38 → 350.54] I have a talent. I have a talent anyway
[351.26 → 357.02] Steam you steam and Linux in the same room. Yeah, the point is I'm not talking about I'm not talking about you guys
[357.02 → 360.46] You can do that. I'm talking about your average like slack-jawed gamer man
[360.46 → 366.54] Like I was at pax one year, and I was at the NVIDIA booth, and they were showing off this was when they were showing off game stream, right?
[366.54 → 367.82] So their Wi-Fi
[367.82 → 371.26] uh game streaming to the shop had they launched the shield console yet?
[371.26 → 372.22] I don't even think so
[372.22 → 377.90] I think it was on the little shield portable that little handheld android box and there's this guy in a beanbag chair
[378.38 → 382.70] And uh, I walk up to him and I'm like, hey, like how's the latency on it?
[382.94 → 384.94] And he's he's like, I kid you not
[387.50 → 389.50] Huh?
[391.10 → 391.66] I don't know
[392.78 → 394.06] That seems like a cool game
[394.78 → 395.42] I'm just like
[396.22 → 401.50] Dude, you're in the're in the NVIDIA booth. You're trying game stream. It's not even running on that machine. That's like the whole point
[402.38 → 404.38] so
[404.38 → 407.82] So I guess my point is like so you're you're your average cheater
[408.38 → 410.38] Someone in full-blink that said his latency was too high
[410.38 → 411.42] It was a little high
[411.42 → 415.74] It was a little a little high. Okay, we were in the pacific northwest. All right, you know, you probably
[416.62 → 418.30] Okay, we got a lot of uh
[418.30 → 422.38] He was enjoying a lot of oceans. We got a lot of oceans. Okay, a lot of reefs. Okay?
[426.62 → 429.74] He's a reefer. This isn't fair. You can't be this on it when you're sick
[429.74 → 432.62] You said it's not the isn't okay
[432.62 → 435.18] You have to um my goodness
[436.22 → 437.66] Anyway, so so so
[438.78 → 442.38] If I was to try to kind of profile the person who needs to cheat at games
[442.38 → 449.66] See when I was a kid the people who cheated at games were like kids right because they didn't they weren't good or
[450.62 → 453.98] They didn't have they didn't have time to use the computer
[453.98 → 458.38] Like I feel like that's kind of flipped around where adults are doing things on their phones
[458.38 → 459.42] And like, you know
[459.42 → 462.46] The kids just kind of seem to have free rein at their computers and stuff
[462.46 → 469.34] Like the adults needed to like to use the computer like you were fighting over and right in particular the internet connection
[469.34 → 474.70] Yeah, right like the phone line needed to stay open unless you're I have an important call tonight
[475.34 → 477.90] Exactly you can just like to be on the internet all the time
[477.98 → 484.78] So you would, you could cheat, and then you could like you could download a Diablo trainer, and then you could kind of like
[485.34 → 491.02] Have your godly plate of the whale I'm so sick now yeah, you know go and fight Diablo or whatever right so
[491.58 → 499.18] So the profile that I might have in my mind for like a cheater as just like you know an average gamer slash a kid
[499.18 → 501.18] Who's not good enough or whatever?
[501.18 → 507.02] That's probably just completely wrong right because you got people who are obviously savvy enough to play a game like Markov
[507.66 → 509.66] But obviously feel the need to cheat at it
[509.66 → 514.46] So you've got these I guess I've talked myself completely out of my argument now because the amount of work
[514.78 → 517.50] That people are seem to be willing to put into
[518.54 → 520.54] Not doing the work
[520.54 → 523.50] There that's what I'm trying to get at here when you and I were
[525.10 → 527.10] Growing up when we were young ins
[527.98 → 534.62] Cheaters were it was generally associated with having some amount of knowledge of like software development even if you got the cheat from someone else
[535.66 → 539.34] It was it seemed like there was some amount of that's true arcane knowledge
[539.34 → 544.06] Like it was a pain in the butt to figure out and the resources to to to research it
[544.06 → 549.82] And the amount of trouble you get in from your parents for going on sites that could get the computer a virus
[550.38 → 556.06] And now its like advertised on YouTube and twitter and stuff like it's its a totally different realm
[556.86 → 557.34] um
[558.30 → 563.50] So I think the like hey this isn't too bad a lot of people actually do this like all the time
[564.14 → 569.58] Is the current vibe and when that's the case you might be more willing to actually try the stuff that would be hard
[569.58 → 572.14] You know what? I mean installing Linux running them that way etc
[574.46 → 574.86] Okay
[574.86 → 576.86] Decimus Roman says
[579.02 → 585.90] Nothing decimus Roman says I suspect that part of this is that Linux doesn't allow video game companies to play the same games
[585.90 → 587.82] They do on Windows with memory inspection
[588.54 → 593.18] Um, but even then the game was a mess on Linux, and they weren't really making progress and fixing it
[593.18 → 597.02] Do you think that Linux cheaters are just a scapegoat?
[597.98 → 600.62] I've I've I wondered about that a little bit. Um
[602.70 → 603.50] Because I do know
[605.26 → 607.74] Yeah, the installation base for
[608.86 → 611.82] Linux for most games tends to be really low
[612.86 → 618.70] I know it's not super common for developers to want to take Linux out of their
[619.50 → 619.90] um
[621.18 → 623.18] You know supported operating systems
[623.18 → 625.34] um mac is the worst
[625.66 → 632.06] Uh, but Linux is pretty bad for that as well. I've heard that this is much less of a problem now that steam deck is a thing
[632.06 → 634.86] Because a higher percentage of your player base does want to be in Linux
[635.26 → 635.66] um
[636.86 → 639.26] But
[640.54 → 642.54] I don't know
[642.70 → 647.82] So okay hold on um gauntlet wizard says it does allow memory inspection in fact more
[647.82 → 653.10] Is it just not supported by their anti-cheat?
[654.54 → 660.22] That's a good question. I'm not sure and again that would come back down to just scapegoating not wanting to put in the resources
[660.86 → 662.86] whoa
[666.46 → 668.86] Is that scapegoating not wanting to put in the resources?
[669.26 → 669.98] No, I mean
[669.98 → 674.62] I just mean saying because it would still be scapegoating to say it's because of people cheating on the platform
[674.62 → 680.70] Well, it is for yeah, so for if is the reason is actually just that they could deal with it
[680.70 → 682.38] But they would just have to put in the work
[682.94 → 685.50] um to figure out you know better memory inspection
[686.06 → 686.78] um and
[686.78 → 688.22] yeah, is that scapegoating though?
[688.22 → 692.70] is memory inspection really the biggest impediment though or would it be more to do with um
[694.30 → 696.86] I was going to say more to do with not being allowed to just
[697.58 → 701.18] run at kernel level willy-nilly but even then they probably like could
[703.02 → 705.02] Tons of different I learned this from playing Markov
[705.02 → 709.26] There are tons of different types of cheats because you could cheat and this would help you in Apex Legends a lot
[709.26 → 714.30] Actually is knowing where everyone on the map is right. Yeah, you can do that without changing what's in the memory
[715.42 → 717.42] You do that just by reading the memory
[718.70 → 722.46] I see and there's nothing you can do to prevent something from just reading
[722.46 → 725.50] I don't see how you'd do that
[727.42 → 727.82] I
[727.82 → 728.94] I
[728.94 → 733.10] Don't make enough about it. I think it shows up in device manager though. Doesn't it?
[734.46 → 734.62] Um
[734.62 → 742.62] On Windows, I don't like a gauntlet wizard says nobody would let them have root to access it because Linux gamers aren't stupid
[742.94 → 747.74] But it's like okay, but hold on a second if the game just requires it if the game just requires it
[747.74 → 753.66] You either don't play or you do it. Yeah, like what do you well what does your I guess that's my question is what is your proposal?
[754.30 → 755.90] for anti-cheat then
[756.46 → 758.38] If is we don't
[758.38 → 763.42] Access this stuff if we don't lock it down like, and I'm not saying this is the way to you know to
[763.98 → 765.98] allow companies to install
[766.06 → 771.26] root kits, or you know kernel level anti-cheat or whatever else I'm not I'm not saying that's the way I'm just saying okay
[771.74 → 774.14] If that isn't the way what's the other way?
[774.14 → 777.10] Like give me give me another way
[778.38 → 780.38] um
[782.06 → 788.38] It's going to be a yeah Windows kernel expert can protect okay. Yeah, so this is more just like people are mainly saying look this
[788.78 → 790.38] pretty much seems to come down to
[791.10 → 793.10] resource management
[793.26 → 795.26] um
[795.34 → 800.62] Yeah, I don't know not a cheat developer. I can't say hardware level encryption of processes memory
[800.62 → 808.70] Huh? I mean we're talking about like a complete architectural shift then at least for you know, like the open
[809.02 → 813.50] You know standards desktop pc. I mean you could do that for a console or whatever else
[813.50 → 816.70] You're not going to do that on Windows at least not for the time being
[817.42 → 817.82] um
[819.26 → 824.70] Apparently auto hotkey gives you aim bot on apex. I've had I've seen a couple of people talk about that
[824.70 → 832.94] This is wild dude. I saw someone in the chat in float plane chat was saying I have a friend who's good at uh
[833.58 → 834.22] What is it?
[835.26 → 836.38] I don't remember what it is
[836.78 → 839.66] battlefield cod something. I don't know some game and
[840.14 → 842.30] basically he uses cheats because
[843.26 → 848.06] He'll get put into lobbies that are too sweaty, and he just wants to go around and kill people
[848.62 → 850.62] it's like
[851.18 → 856.62] Look, I can't tell you so play with bots. I can't tell you who to be friends with and who to not be friends with
[857.42 → 857.74] um
[858.62 → 861.34] But your friends an asshole so yeah
[863.58 → 863.82] Like
[865.10 → 870.70] That it's mathematical. I genuinely get suspicious of what other
[873.90 → 877.74] Like if they're is they're okay with that what other things are they okay with you know
[877.74 → 884.38] And that that's a bit of a slippery slope because you're expecting every person to be perfect, but it's like it's its it's concerning
[884.38 → 885.82] And there's an easy it would raise a red
[885.82 → 889.82] No, there's an easy counterargument the easy counterargument is it's a game
[890.54 → 892.54] Does it even really matter that much?
[892.54 → 894.38] And then there's an easy counterargument to that
[895.10 → 897.42] If someone is willing to lie
[898.06 → 904.14] Or cheat or step on someone else when the stakes are so low when it doesn't even matter
[904.14 → 906.78] When it hardly impacts them at all
[908.78 → 913.66] If it was on the line if it was a big deal would they stand up for what's right?
[914.78 → 916.78] Heck no, obviously. Yeah
[916.78 → 922.78] Like they were willing to compromise their principles for literally zero personal gain
[923.98 → 924.46] nothing
[926.14 → 928.94] I don't know just food for thought just food for thought
[929.50 → 934.78] Yeah, yeah funny hat says if you wouldn't trust a man with a dollar would you trust him with a million dollars?
[936.06 → 938.86] People I'm there. There's someone I stopped playing badminton with
[939.26 → 940.86] um because I was
[940.86 → 947.02] I was sitting behind their court at a tournament, and it was uh it was like 22 20
[947.02 → 950.22] so it was like into deuce where you have to win by two points third set
[951.02 → 951.58] and
[951.58 → 953.10] the other team
[953.74 → 956.30] hit a clear over their head and it
[957.26 → 958.54] obviously
[958.54 → 959.34] um
[959.34 → 960.46] landed
[960.46 → 961.26] out
[961.26 → 963.42] no, it obviously, obviously landed in
[964.30 → 965.18] and they called it out
[965.18 → 969.50] and the way that it works in recreational tournaments
[970.14 → 976.94] is that the line call is the team that is on that side you call your own line calls
[977.34 → 982.22] because you're closer you're the only one who can realistically tell there's no line judges because we don't have
[982.62 → 988.70] you know six people to line up down all edges of the court and like check everything because it's just wreck right? Yeah
[988.70 → 989.26] um
[989.26 → 989.42] um
[990.62 → 991.02] and
[991.02 → 994.22] what you're supposed to do is if you're not sure if you replay the point
[994.94 → 995.26] okay?
[995.26 → 998.46] If there's a dispute you're supposed to replay the point, so the other person was like uh
[999.58 → 1000.62] that was
[1000.62 → 1002.38] obviously in
[1002.38 → 1002.78] um
[1003.66 → 1004.06] and
[1004.70 → 1008.06] this person who I had been playing with on a fairly regular basis
[1008.54 → 1012.54] was like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and like got all aggressive about it
[1013.02 → 1016.54] and declared themselves the winner of the game and the other people being
[1016.54 → 1017.42] you know
[1018.94 → 1019.90] non-confrontational
[1019.90 → 1023.34] and just being like dude this it's a game like what is
[1023.90 → 1028.14] what are we even what are we even doing here they backed down because they were like this is ridiculous
[1028.86 → 1030.30] and I was like
[1030.30 → 1031.34] yeah, that's uh
[1031.34 → 1032.06] I
[1032.06 → 1032.94] I would never
[1033.82 → 1036.14] I will never play with that person again
[1036.70 → 1036.94] I
[1036.94 → 1039.98] I will never set foot on a court with that person because you are just
[1041.26 → 1043.26] you're a dishonest person
[1043.26 → 1048.70] uh, you have shown your character more clearly than any words you could ever say
[1048.70 → 1049.74] yeah, um
[1050.46 → 1053.50] especially in such a like not that it makes it better in a competitive
[1054.62 → 1054.78] uh
[1057.98 → 1064.94] game but like it's just it's it is feels almost worse that it was like a casual recreational match
[1065.58 → 1067.98] yeah, you know, like I just I don't know
[1067.98 → 1071.66] I mean in so well, and you know what? No, no, I think that's a fair point because
[1071.66 → 1073.34] in a professional league
[1074.14 → 1075.66] part of the gamesmanship
[1076.86 → 1081.10] like literally I had this I had this like NHL card game when I was a kid
[1081.98 → 1082.94] and um
[1082.94 → 1083.74] I don't know if you ever heard of that
[1083.74 → 1089.02] one of and so what would happen is like you could like you would it was like a deck game, and you would
[1089.02 → 1091.82] well, I mean any card games a deck game whatever just calm down the point
[1091.82 → 1096.70] and it wasn't a deck building game it was a card game so you would draw your cards and so you could um
[1096.70 → 1100.62] um you could play shot and the other person would have to have a save
[1101.74 → 1108.86] okay or they could play a hook, and then I could play um
[1110.30 → 1116.14] the ref to call the hook oh okay, and then you can play behind the ref's back
[1116.14 → 1121.82] and then the hook wouldn't get called and then my shot wouldn't go in
[1121.82 → 1127.66] you know like, so there were like multiple ways to defend interesting against a goal okay and so and
[1127.66 → 1135.74] and so I guess what I'm trying to say is I think at a professional level there is a there is a certain amount of gamesmanship that is
[1137.10 → 1144.62] pushing the boundaries, but then that's avoiding detection why you would have a ref or a line judge at that level of competition exactly yeah
[1144.62 → 1151.34] yeah so I guess what I'm trying to say is yes at a professional level no I think I don't I don't really respect it
[1151.34 → 1158.94] no I don't like dirty players yeah, but I also do acknowledge that that is the expectation and that if
[1159.50 → 1166.70] everyone's doing it now it's part of the game yeah, and we can don't mean it's good the dives in soccer are
[1167.34 → 1173.98] disgusting and ridiculous extremely detrimental to the credibility of the sport as an outsider who actually
[1173.98 → 1182.30] enjoys watching football there I'll even I'll even use the proper name for the sport out of
[1182.30 → 1188.46] respect women's football soccer whatever it's fun and cool to watch they don't dive yep so as someone
[1188.46 → 1193.58] as someone who thinks the game is super cool and I don't see a lot of it, and I'm used to hockey
[1193.58 → 1199.02] you know, so I'm not going to be I'm not one of the one of those Americans who's like I watch basketball if
[1199.02 → 1204.38] there's no scoring for like 18 seconds I'm bored like what's happening why is it why isn't anybody
[1204.38 → 1209.98] scoring that's so big like I don't even mind it I don't even mind it I come from hockey I'll
[1209.98 → 1215.50] watch a zero I'll watch a nil game all the time no problem um I mean I prefer scoring I think we all
[1215.50 → 1222.14] do but but I like the tension you know I like the tension but it yeah really it really takes me out
[1222.14 → 1228.70] of it dude it takes me out of it in a big way oh yeah when it just feels like instead of watching
[1228.70 → 1235.58] uh a sports competition I'm watching a freaking like high school level acting competition yeah it's
[1235.58 → 1240.86] pathetic I was trying to get into it at one point in time yeah if I wanted to watch that immediately
[1240.86 → 1244.30] turn it off the second someone I'd watch YouTuber apology video duels
[1244.30 → 1251.98] that'd actually be kind of a funny uh a funny concept for a video how well would ours do uh I
[1251.98 → 1257.58] don't know I didn't PewDiePie review it did he think, so I don't know I think, so I have no idea
[1258.30 → 1263.50] I wonder what he said I don't remember I probably looked at it at some point
[1266.54 → 1272.62] mick leggings says well you're still around hey uh all right then I guess uh then I guess uh I guess
[1272.62 → 1278.70] I'd probably do pretty okay um what now
[1281.58 → 1287.34] how big is this creator oh no what is this what is this what is this
[1291.58 → 1291.90] yeah
[1294.30 → 1297.34] is this seriously the last video they uploaded too like this
[1297.82 → 1302.38] what is this left it off on a banger dude 2.4 million views I didn't mean to click on the video
[1302.38 → 1304.70] team leg clips or oh man
[1311.34 → 1313.42] what is this what are you looking at
[1315.74 → 1317.34] now that's content baby
[1320.22 → 1324.62] how did they how did they get my brain in videos
[1324.62 → 1331.74] relatable
[1333.66 → 1336.22] what the heck oh man
[1336.22 → 1337.50] Dan hit me with that before I forget
[1338.62 → 1339.50] is that my key thanks
[1340.30 → 1340.94] oh okay
[1341.90 → 1343.74] oh man I forgot what I was even trying to find
[1343.74 → 1344.70] oh yeah yeah
[1344.70 → 1353.66] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah why not
[1353.66 → 1355.58] it's its healthy
[1355.58 → 1357.34] I'll be in the Tuesday
[1357.34 → 1358.14] I'll be in the Tuesday
[1358.14 → 1358.30] just screaming
[1360.78 → 1361.98] oh my goodness
[1361.98 → 1363.02] all right um
[1364.38 → 1369.34] so here's my here's my last sort of question coming back to the whole
[1369.34 → 1372.30] is it just because Linux gamers are cheaters
[1373.26 → 1378.78] I guess if it's just like if it's just like a scapegoat thing linux people are
[1378.78 → 1383.42] cheaters or if it's just and the real reason is we don't feel like doing the work
[1383.90 → 1389.74] then why are so many other anti-cheat games not bothering is it also just because they don't
[1389.74 → 1390.86] feel like putting in the work
[1390.86 → 1397.10] stuff uh I wouldn't be too surprised um I'd be interested to hear from actual anti-cheat
[1397.10 → 1404.62] developers because honestly I don't know, but I'm thinking about you know how much work it is to
[1404.62 → 1411.58] even try to keep up with the cheating community as anti-cheat developers uh because you're you're kind
[1411.58 → 1418.38] of like I'm making assumptions here not an anti-cheat developer yeah you're kind of you have to sort
[1418.38 → 1423.90] of be reactive yeah oh I would think so that sucks I mean you're going to try to get out ahead of it
[1423.90 → 1427.98] sure but like I'm sure you have some developers that are pushing trying to get ahead some developers
[1427.98 → 1432.70] that are pushing to try to be reactive, but we've talked about this before where certain departments
[1432.70 → 1438.22] are revenue generating departments and other departments are considered you know more like
[1438.22 → 1443.90] boat anchor departments and if I'm is I'm a game developer I'm looking at my anti-cheat not as
[1443.90 → 1449.42] a revenue generation department but as like an as a burden as something that I need to
[1449.98 → 1455.18] well usually anti-cheat is a separate company uh sorry, but you're you're still gonna sorry, sorry
[1455.18 → 1459.10] sorry uh you're still going to have internal people that are responsible for the implementation you're
[1459.10 → 1465.66] still going to have internal people that are uh working to make sure that the game actually functions with
[1465.66 → 1471.58] the third party um and so this is something that by and large and there's still going to be a limit to how
[1471.58 → 1476.46] much you're going to want to pay your third party anti-cheat so in terms of the investment
[1476.46 → 1483.98] you're making an anti-cheat it's not a going to pay 50 percent more to have Linux compatible to counter
[1483.98 → 1490.62] to counter how much cheat developers can charge for their services right so what we're looking at is a
[1490.62 → 1499.02] situation where the investment in cheating software is a revenue generating department an exciting
[1499.02 → 1507.34] department whereas the investment in anti-cheat is like a burdensome we have to do this so we can sell more
[1507.34 → 1514.54] hopefully the the the players don't scream too much yeah exactly um and so you're always gonna i I just feel
[1514.54 → 1519.98] like you're always going to be on the back foot that way um and there's a really there's a really
[1519.98 → 1525.58] unpleasant comment in the float plane chat someone said because they're lazy and that is just
[1525.58 → 1534.38] so unfair to developers i I have had the pleasure of meeting some game developers and i
[1534.38 → 1543.42] haven't met a single one that I would characterize as just lazy yeah um in fact they've felt to me and
[1543.42 → 1547.50] this is based on limited interactions none of them are my best friends or anything did you meet the
[1547.50 → 1553.58] developers sorry yeah like this is a person who their job is due development yeah well they're not
[1553.58 → 1558.22] picking their tasks well I know that's where I'm getting to look he ruined the thing I'm working on
[1558.22 → 1563.34] a whole setup here I do specialize at that yeah I mean but what I'm trying to say is like they've
[1563.34 → 1570.70] seemed in every case passionate um and a lot of the time if they're not getting resources if they're not
[1570.70 → 1577.42] getting time they're not getting tasked thank you Luke on these things that will improve the game
[1577.42 → 1582.78] for their community well it comes down to the bean counters that that comes from somewhere to defend
[1582.78 → 1588.38] potentially the bean counters sometimes there are business realities that there's nothing that they
[1588.38 → 1594.14] can do about if we spend all this time and all this money on this thing that like four people care about
[1594.14 → 1599.58] it will cost us an opportunity over here it will come at to the detriment of these other things can I
[1599.58 → 1605.98] no longer hire a person to help this other overworked person we have on the team uh can we not give good
[1605.98 → 1612.22] raises this year do we have to lay people off because we're out of money um these are questions
[1612.22 → 1617.58] that bean counters are trying to do that monolith, and it's rough out there right now that monolith
[1617.58 → 1625.26] tour was so cool um like the number of of the game I wouldn't say necessarily all of them
[1625.26 → 1630.94] were devs but dads and artists um the number of the people that worked on the game that were like
[1630.94 → 1637.82] so multi-hatted and uh like they literally did their own combat mobcap just like people who worked
[1637.82 → 1644.30] in the studio who were like yeah i like train karate on my own time I'm going in the
[1644.30 → 1651.74] mobcap room to like fight with people and like which is so sick that is so cool that was a really
[1651.74 → 1659.50] cool thing that we did um speaking of things being rough out there dude did you see Warner brothers
[1659.50 → 1669.42] said they lost a hundred million dollars um hold on lost 100 million I'm working on it uh they lost
[1669.42 → 1676.22] yeah here we go multi versus and quidditch champions together contributed Aquila and flow plane chat said it's
[1676.22 → 1682.14] rough when you do bad decisions I don't disagree I will also say and I'm not saying that you don't
[1682.14 → 1687.50] I'm just I think sometimes a lot of the feedback that you hear from that is people that don't
[1687.50 → 1693.74] make that level of decision it's also really easy to look at those level of decisions in hindsight and
[1693.74 → 1698.14] be like yeah that was obviously stupid I've done stuff that was obviously stupid in hindsight
[1698.14 → 1706.78] I don't know can you think of anything uh yeah we can move on
[1713.02 → 1719.42] yeah we're good I think I broke him I think there 's's so many things running to his brain right
[1719.42 → 1725.18] now it's actually reached a runaway state, and he can't bring it back under control
[1725.18 → 1731.90] okay what were we even talking about we were talking about the hard r incident oh my
[1734.06 → 1741.50] uh which was not that word okay it was not that word yeah yeah yeah that's not a word that I believe
[1742.14 → 1747.66] exists in my vocabulary in my life to Aquila or whatever trust me I get it and there's a lot of
[1747.66 → 1753.82] scenarios where I feel like even if is we're not thinking in a hindsight sense I'm looking at some of
[1753.82 → 1757.90] the things some of these companies are doing I'm like oh my that's so incredibly dumb and I mean
[1759.58 → 1764.46] it happens I'm not defending all of it I'm just saying sometimes like I don't know it doesn't it's
[1764.46 → 1770.38] it's not automatically that this person was just like being a malicious jerk um sometimes they're just
[1770.38 → 1774.78] trying to deal with the cards they have, and they don't have a great option, and they do the one they
[1774.78 → 1778.70] think is best and none of them were good and that one sucks and people are mad it's what was that
[1778.70 → 1784.70] channel that you were talking about that like that takes apart the bags and stuff oh yeah did you
[1784.70 → 1791.26] watch that because you just like the taste of leather so much or what i just couldn't
[1791.26 → 1795.10] help noticing that out of the two of us for some reason you're the corporate bootlicker no I'm just
[1795.10 → 1799.82] I'm no I'm giving him a hard time my goodness I'm giving all Luke's trying to say is that everyone
[1799.82 → 1804.38] well everyone's human and I mean that at a variety of levels too right we could be talking about a small
[1804.38 → 1809.10] indie game with two people or one person yeah um and i and I mean that all the way up I suspect
[1809.74 → 1815.10] the more the company size grows the more it is malicious and bad and dumb decisions I think the
[1815.10 → 1820.38] more it is attached too exactly um you have people that don't care about the thing that they're making
[1820.38 → 1824.86] they just want more money and you have people who don't know who the people working on it are
[1824.86 → 1829.10] absolutely they don't see them they don't interact with them every day like these are absolutely
[1829.10 → 1837.66] things I'm just saying like I don't know anyway WB games um lost a hundred million dollars on multi
[1837.66 → 1847.50] versus and quidditch champions can I just say for a moment that I would be happy Warner brothers I would
[1847.50 → 1856.94] be happy to work as a consultant for you okay and if you'd like for the small fee of 99 million dollars
[1856.94 → 1865.66] oh okay I would be happy to tell you that whether you should make a game or not yeah yeah yeah and
[1865.66 → 1873.98] quidditch champions let me get let me it's a pretty obvious no yeah speaking of speaking
[1873.98 → 1879.02] of uh, uh bad decisions that we don't need hindsight to have known whether I don't know anything
[1879.02 → 1883.42] about this game not even sort of surprised it didn't do well why would you buy a quidditch game
[1883.42 → 1891.90] quidditch literally is a sport what are the worst thought of sports that was invented by someone
[1891.90 → 1899.18] who hates sports I didn't know that I'm not surprised thinks they're stupid and went out of their way
[1899.18 → 1908.38] to make a like an um just terribly designed game uh what's the word what it's its it's its not
[1908.38 → 1914.22] parody it's satire it's its it's like it's its it's, or maybe it is parody I don't know it's
[1914.22 → 1919.50] whatever the word I'm looking for it is it's its intent caricature that's pretty good thanks ninja dude
[1919.50 → 1928.30] it's a caricature of sport it is emphasizes the weird tribalism to the point where people are cheering
[1928.30 → 1937.02] when people get seriously injured or almost killed it, it has intentionally arbitrary rules to sort of
[1937.02 → 1944.30] to to to highlight how utterly arbitrary the rules can sometimes feel especially if you don't
[1944.30 → 1951.58] really understand sports, and you don't care to learn about them like it is intentionally
[1952.38 → 1960.94] stupid and intentionally makes no sense and this is something that isn't even just like a retcon
[1960.94 → 1969.50] oh yeah you know I totally intended for that plot hole um, or you know I intended for those characters
[1969.50 → 1975.90] to have an unspoken relationship, or you know whatever this isn't just some like random inserted in an
[1975.90 → 1980.94] interview five years after the fact this was like well established right early on yeah quidditch is
[1980.94 → 1985.26] stupid and that's totally on purpose um yeah
[1985.26 → 1991.90] yeah and also like it was one of those games I remember reading about it because there was pretty
[1991.90 → 1999.98] much no way for them to win on this because to make the game um true to the sport right like in the
[1999.98 → 2007.34] novels and in the movies you have to it would have to suck yes and you and so you would anger a lot
[2007.34 → 2014.46] of the hardcore fans of you know the Harry Potter universe right and then to make a balanced
[2014.46 → 2021.82] game that would actually play like a decent game at all um well yeah basically you have to completely
[2021.82 → 2025.98] change over right so if you make a balanced game you'll, you'll, you'll screw up with the hardcore
[2025.98 → 2029.66] and if you make the game the way that it was in the novels and the way it was in the movies
[2030.38 → 2036.62] it'll be completely unplayable yeah to any gamer who's like knows what a rule set is and how the yeah
[2036.62 → 2042.46] I've raiden 428 says they should have just done Calvin ball at that point yeah dude
[2043.02 → 2049.98] I would play the out of Calvin ball yeah like okay why not because bill Watterson would never license
[2049.98 → 2060.46] it that's why that makes sense bill William if I may, you know what no I disagree hold on okay hold on
[2060.46 → 2071.42] william okay how about this as a deal how about this as a deal okay you license Calvin
[2071.42 → 2083.74] and Hobbs wait wait you license Calvin and Hobbs stop it but the not-for-profit organization
[2083.74 → 2093.10] that runs it okay has like all the safeguards okay it has like capped executive pay for the people who
[2093.10 → 2103.42] met stop it for the people who manage the IP okay it contributes literally 100 of its yearly proceeds
[2103.42 → 2112.14] to the foundation or the cause of your choice um in perpetuity and and and and it just it contributes
[2112.14 → 2119.98] in some way in some way just nothing but good to the world with all the profits that it may give me a Hobbs toy
[2123.26 → 2130.78] i think based bill Watterson understands that given the erosion of time and entropy
[2131.42 → 2138.14] all things are able to become corrupted and wasted well then he knows that as soon as he dies it's going to happen anyway
[2138.14 → 2149.18] hold on as long as you can or don't live to see your thing that you made ruined or instead of
[2150.14 → 2155.58] writing don't allow the hobbit to be made in video in movie form instead of writing that weird
[2156.86 → 2163.50] picture book or whatever yeah spend your time spend your time like making it make it setting it up for
[2163.50 → 2171.10] coolness before you go man because the world needs more Calvin and Hobbs did it that'd be cool
[2171.82 → 2174.46] well he doesn't want to he's like retired no
[2175.74 → 2181.74] unretired well I would like that to don't make like better this time yeah better this time please
[2181.74 → 2190.22] don't make that thing what up dude me yeah I mean what I guess oh
[2192.06 → 2198.94] state your request over here what hello oh, oh hi uh okay is this live right now yeah yeah why are you
[2198.94 → 2205.98] doing this damn I don't know any more okay bye all right uh Dan do you have merch messages for me
[2205.98 → 2211.90] uh sure BRB one sec okay bye what topic are we even on I don't remember I don't uh
[2212.46 → 2218.22] Ea ditching Linux I don't know how we go oh it's happening oh this makes this kind of suck bye is what
[2218.22 → 2225.74] it is though we'll uh we'll do what we can anyway uh yeah sure you guys should go away there we go yeah
[2225.74 → 2233.42] leave please thank you I love you uh okay let's see what do I get what do we get okay I am so out of it
[2233.42 → 2240.70] today I'm so sorry it's okay, okay it's okay what do we have I know that there was something dude so
[2240.70 → 2245.74] I have to I've I've so the wan show has been ending slightly early for quite a while because I've had to
[2245.74 → 2255.26] do bird meds every day 12 hours apart because it's 12 hours apart, and you know you have to go to work
[2255.26 → 2261.74] it's basically determined that the latest it could be in the morning it's like 8 30. Um so we do birds
[2261.74 → 2266.46] med bird meds at 8 30 in the morning that means 12 hours later we have to do bird meds at 8 30 at
[2266.46 → 2272.46] night my girlfriend's going to be away this weekend so I've had to try to learn how to do
[2273.02 → 2277.58] bird meds alone we've had this we've had this strategy where I catch them she gives them the
[2277.58 → 2282.78] medicine we're good we make the room really dark they have terrible dark vision uh humans have
[2282.78 → 2286.94] generally better dark vision I can see them I can catch them no problem and I hold them with two hands
[2286.94 → 2291.10] so that I have a very nice hold on them where there's no pressure at all they're mostly just
[2291.10 → 2295.42] like standing on one of my fingers while I'm just not allowing them to leave and I nicely hold their
[2295.42 → 2300.22] head in place and everything's all good and safe, and they're generally okay with it, I now have to
[2300.22 → 2304.46] catch them entirely holding them in one hand and then medicine feed them with my other hand which is
[2304.46 → 2309.98] the traditional way to do if it's a hard thing to learn I'm figuring that out right now that's been uh
[2309.98 → 2319.10] that's been a that's been a trip um ask for help um like from who's going to be able to help me at
[2319.10 → 2326.86] 8 30 in the morning in my house um what if the other bird helped yeah oh we got a line of spec
[2326.86 → 2334.22] already we didn't even get to do a merch message a manoeuvre that was so fast what did you do sound like
[2334.22 → 2339.02] my wife again what did you do uh
[2343.58 → 2349.90] I'm good me yeah yeah I got my chips okay yeah yeah yeah that's good all right just making sure
[2349.90 → 2351.10] Canada hasn't been invaded yet
[2353.74 → 2356.62] it's great life is good no what are we talking about uh
[2358.62 → 2362.94] I don't think we actually got to immerse messages i was buying time we do actually have to explain
[2362.94 → 2368.06] merch messages and do a couple, so this is probably are we due to do that okay hey merch messages
[2368.70 → 2374.14] the best way to interact with the show it's merch messages or just I don't know rolling up and
[2374.14 → 2379.82] interrupting apparently because that's what Jake does what a guy what a flipping guy so we don't
[2379.82 → 2384.30] do twitch bits we don't do super chats we do merch messages because the way that we see it if you're
[2384.30 → 2389.74] going to throw money at your screen hey your screen should throw something right back in your face
[2389.74 → 2391.82] that's right
[2393.82 → 2398.86] what did you just throw I don't know it was heavy though it exploded yeah it was pretty exciting
[2399.34 → 2404.94] um, so the point is that all you got to do to send a merch message which will go to
[2404.94 → 2410.94] producer Dan over here I wasn't aiming at you Dan no it's exploded all over the floor it's fine it's
[2410.94 → 2413.98] fine yeah yeah it's good you sound like my wife now
[2417.18 → 2420.06] oh don't take a backlight home the point is
[2422.06 → 2428.78] the point is that all you got to do is go on lttstore.com throw something in your cart you'll
[2428.78 → 2433.58] see a little box for merch messages you can leave a merch message it'll go to producer Dan he'll forward
[2433.58 → 2437.42] it to someone answer it himself he'll pop it up at the bottom of the screen, or he will curate it
[2437.42 → 2443.66] for me and Luke to respond to live on the show you don't have to do that anymore do what you got
[2443.66 → 2448.86] an operation and everything yeah yeah yeah yeah 100 100 now it's just for fun
[2451.58 → 2455.90] all right maybe we can wrap up this segment and get into some merch messages well that's what I should
[2455.90 → 2464.14] have done yeah that wouldn't be a problem I know you can't be this on it when you're sick you're
[2464.14 → 2470.38] setting an unfair bar I'm never going to be able to do the way to what I'm saying it's ridiculous um
[2471.90 → 2478.06] so anyway uh it's in it's in the cart you check out your merch something we'll reply to it
[2478.06 → 2483.34] curated merch messages Dan do you want to show a couple of them how it works sure sure sure
[2483.34 → 2489.58] uh Linus do you still hold your meme stock or did you end up selling it all uh Yvonne took it from
[2489.58 → 2496.94] me at some point because we needed to shift some cash around at some point um I think we lost money
[2496.94 → 2503.34] it was I can't remember the fact I remember that yeah um I remember you I think one of you told me and
[2503.34 → 2509.90] I was like oh you like still had that the investment account is empty now not because we lost everything
[2509.90 → 2516.78] was it did it come out flat i actually legitimately don't remember anymore but Yvonne needed to move
[2516.78 → 2521.34] everything that was out of that sort of play money investment account that she let me have
[2521.34 → 2527.10] um, and she needed to do something responsible oh I think uh to buy the smash champs building yeah
[2527.10 → 2532.14] probably yeah I think it was probably the down payment for smash champs it's okay so what okay so I hear
[2532.14 → 2536.30] you when you say the investment account is empty and i I understand how that functionally works but
[2536.30 → 2540.62] when you have things like the NAS company and framework like is that because those are
[2540.62 → 2546.62] different forms of so when I say the investment account is empty market that yeah yeah
[2546.62 → 2555.82] okay yeah so I own literally zero dollars in the market in the market yeah however I think uh I think i
[2555.82 → 2563.90] have uh an investment in a REIT uh i forget what it stands for real estate something t something
[2563.90 → 2568.78] it's some kind of like term deposit thing, and they like to invest in real estate on your behalf or
[2568.78 → 2577.50] okay something like that um so i i have a small amount in a REIT um i I have the uh
[2577.50 → 2585.34] approximately uh quarter mid in framework like 220 or 225 or something like that uh it's a similar
[2585.98 → 2591.50] amount in um I don't know if they've they've announced their names right the name
[2592.14 → 2596.62] hashtag well now it's announced I think so I think there's even a website in the NAS yeah in the NAS
[2596.62 → 2605.42] software company um and that I have real estate holdings and then I own stocks in Linus media group
[2605.42 → 2612.78] inc this thing yeah hex OS hashtag yeah it's down at the bottom of the page yeah yep so that that is
[2612.78 → 2620.30] that is it um it's one of those things where I think that there would definitely have been
[2620.30 → 2631.26] opportunities for me to do extremely well in tech stocks um, but it has seemed an inconvenient and be
[2631.98 → 2638.62] extremely um unethical yeah to more morally questionable to participate um I wanted to buy
[2638.62 → 2645.66] NVIDIA back when it was like 17 when I worked at NCI that would have been a pretty good move yeah
[2647.98 → 2654.06] it is what it is but yeah you you know how it is I think yeah I think holding framework
[2654.78 → 2659.42] like ultra mega long term is a little bit different from like diamond hands tech stocks
[2659.98 → 2666.14] diamond hands those are very framework the framework was I wonder what the technical value of that
[2666.14 → 2671.58] investment is now I don't know I was going to say Nero offered to tell me last time I saw him when I was
[2671.58 → 2677.18] at computer and I was like dude I actually don't want to know yeah it's not going to change anything yeah
[2677.18 → 2687.34] and the reality of it is even if it even is it doubled even if it quadrupled um it's not it's not
[2687.34 → 2695.02] gonna impact our business in any meaningful way like uh where we're not um salary we're not cash strapped
[2695.02 → 2702.06] um it's not like we're it's not like we like to have a trouble making payroll um you know and i
[2702.06 → 2707.98] feel like now is a good time just like shout out the team like massive shout out to the merch
[2707.98 → 2713.18] team business team content team I did we talk about this last week we had an all hands
[2713.74 → 2718.46] we talked about in the all hands yeah we had an all hands earlier this week and um this week was
[2718.46 → 2731.66] it was a long week dude was it this week uh yeah holy crap oh my no I'm glad oh no that's not okay
[2731.66 → 2738.70] that that's actually we all should not feel like that I'm upset that's actually upsetting what a week
[2738.70 → 2746.38] that's crazy um okay we have weird it's weird that the beginning of covid feels like it was like
[2746.38 → 2751.66] a couple of years ago I know, but this week feels like it was a month long yeah I could have guessed at
[2751.66 → 2757.58] least two or three weeks yeah so we had an all hands this week and uh i was the one of the
[2757.58 → 2762.86] quarterly speakers it was mine and Yvonne's turn from the exec team to speak in addition to sort of
[2762.86 → 2768.22] Taryn giving opening and closing remarks great PowerPoint uh thank you very much I drew
[2768.22 → 2776.70] our building on fire um and my point was there are a lot of headwinds coming for us and um so what we
[2776.70 → 2781.98] should just give up so it was kind of a was kind of a little talk about resilience um for the team
[2781.98 → 2787.90] and in both directions um you know talking about the resilience we're going to need to have going forward
[2787.90 → 2794.46] and also celebrating the resilience that we have shown uh over the last realistically the last few
[2794.46 → 2802.70] years which have has involved a hyper growth phase and a shrink phase and then a more gradual
[2803.74 → 2809.66] re-clawing our way back to where we were phase and um and i I took a little bit of time to
[2810.22 → 2817.10] to shout out um some of the teams that have been essential for that um for that kind of
[2818.38 → 2823.34] I don't I don't know what to I don't know what to call it other than just like um like a getting
[2823.34 → 2833.26] back on track right um like LTT uh I think I had said was within like 15 percent 10 within 10 percent
[2833.26 → 2842.22] of where views were like sort of last July last June last July um the overall company like the entire
[2842.22 → 2848.78] portfolio I think was in was within like 15 or 20 percent viewership wise uh float plane massive
[2848.78 → 2854.94] massive shout out to the float plane team uh to the social teams so Sammy if you floaters are
[2854.94 → 2860.78] watching all those exclusives Sammy's been killing it man crushing I've really been enjoying crushing it
[2860.78 → 2866.54] the full plane content um and you, and you know I mean like Sammy doesn't operate in a vacuum you know
[2866.54 → 2870.30] you got to give no you got to give credit to the behind the scenes folks right like obviously there's
[2870.30 → 2873.90] there are the editors you know the community management like chewy there are the guys that
[2873.90 → 2878.30] are working on strategy from the business team um that are helping with all this stuff yeah huge
[2878.30 → 2885.34] shout out business team but basically like every team it's kind of been resilient um was what i
[2885.34 → 2890.94] what I had wanted to talk about and I forget where I started on all of this do does anyone remember what
[2890.94 → 2897.74] the question was I don't think I remember anymore Dan do you still hold meme stocks oh yeah right um
[2897.74 → 2903.34] yeah I don't remember how I got here, but anyway the team is amazing and thank you all oh right float plane
[2903.34 → 2913.82] is back almost up to 40 000 uh 40 000 members which is pretty nuts kind of unbelievable yeah you know if
[2913.82 → 2919.26] you think about it because that we spiked up that high because of the YouTube hack
[2920.14 → 2925.74] um and then we know we thought it was going to decline after the YouTube hack because it was such
[2925.74 → 2932.22] a crazy spike, and we thought that people were at least some of the people coming in had no long-term
[2932.22 → 2936.62] intentions even before they saw the platform we were hoping that some of them were going to see it and be
[2936.62 → 2940.54] like oh this is actually pretty cool I'm going to stay um that did seem to happen to a surprisingly
[2940.54 → 2946.22] large percentage of them, but some people were just going to naturally fade out um but to be back
[2946.22 → 2954.30] up to near YouTube hack levels is like whoa pretty nuts do you remember why I was talking about the
[2954.30 → 2957.90] all hands because I don't I got distracted by the fact that I thought that that was like a month ago
[2958.86 → 2965.26] no okay cool well anyway uh oh we you were talking about how the company doesn't need the money
[2965.26 → 2973.34] uh oh yeah framework yeah okay so the um the framework thing yeah how did that how did that
[2973.34 → 2977.42] figure into that I don't know uh because we were talking about investments you were talking about
[2977.42 → 2982.22] how you could try to sell we were talking about do you know the valuation of your investment
[2982.22 → 2987.50] oh yeah no I have no idea yeah yeah I have no idea and uh, and it doesn't matter all right and it
[2987.50 → 2992.14] doesn't matter because I was talking to the team about how like we're kind of back baby yeah
[2992.14 → 3000.22] um we had two separate threads two I saw this with a bunch of upvotes I think it was either I think
[3000.22 → 3007.10] it was last week on the Subreddit that were like to have you been just like really enjoying the content
[3007.10 → 3015.50] lately and people were like yeah it's been it's been, and you know what it's been it's been really
[3015.50 → 3024.30] heartening uh for the team like today i I read out what I thought was just a really cool comment
[3024.30 → 3029.74] on um on one of proof's recent videos um what was oh yeah I know what one you're talking about
[3030.46 → 3034.94] you do I think I know the comment you're talking about yeah you do how could you possibly know this
[3034.94 → 3040.54] this did you read through chewy's uh oh no you sent me a comment oh no it's a different one
[3040.54 → 3049.58] oh um, so this was on uh almost nobody else has the world's best TV and uh they go this channel
[3049.58 → 3054.46] is running on all cylinders again the creativity of the skits the edgy jokes the efficient means of
[3054.46 → 3059.26] delivering useful information the creation of a culture for tech LTT is putting out some great
[3059.26 → 3064.30] stuff lately Linus seems like he's in a flow state it's good to see honestly I hope you continue to
[3064.30 → 3070.78] create a reputation for quality transparency and fun you guys are killing it um that doesn't happen
[3070.78 → 3077.58] with Linus in a flow state right like that happens when you've got resilience that happens when you've
[3077.58 → 3085.58] got people working hard caring a lot um and just kind of and just kind of bearing down and getting it done
[3085.58 → 3088.54] and when I say bearing down and getting it done that doesn't mean that you have to like
[3088.54 → 3096.22] be in being like a frantic like you know horrible state all the time it means
[3096.70 → 3103.18] focusing on what we need to be doing and not allowing yourself to get distracted by negativity
[3103.18 → 3109.58] or by um by things that don't matter you know by little details important stuff unimportant details
[3109.58 → 3115.10] one thing I would say as well is when generally when commenters make comments like Linus feels like he's in
[3115.10 → 3121.26] a flow state or input pretty much anyone else's public facing name it's really what I think
[3121.26 → 3126.30] they're generally saying not always obviously but what they're generally saying is like the
[3126.30 → 3131.50] personification of this person which is a bunch of people in the company in a trench coat is doing
[3131.50 → 3136.86] well if that makes sense yeah like the person and the supporting teams around them are doing well
[3136.86 → 3143.98] and to be clear not everything is perfect no right like of course not will be we're not perfect
[3143.98 → 3151.18] not everything is going according to plan and nope we still make mistakes sometimes um yep like I think
[3151.18 → 3161.10] we called a dozen 7 or dozen 5 or something like that core ultra 5285k which is not its name yep
[3161.10 → 3165.42] and I also misspoke at the beginning of video where I was like AMD doesn't really make dozen 5s and dozen
[3165.42 → 3172.70] 3s any more we were literally reviewing a dozen 5 my point was AMD doesn't really make low-end chips in their
[3172.70 → 3179.58] current generation any more they just like don't bother when the earlier dozen generations AMD brought
[3179.58 → 3184.62] their latest tech they brought there a game to budget consumers, and now they just don't do it
[3184.62 → 3191.42] I misspoke I said dozen 5 and dozen 3 when what I meant was dozen 3 and a very limited lineup of dozen
[3191.42 → 3196.86] 5s because they've just kind of hollowed out their low end and I'm sorry I'm sorry um it doesn't change
[3196.86 → 3201.18] my point and yeah I should make sure that we're actually you know saying the right words at the right
[3201.18 → 3209.90] times in the right order um but yeah I think we're um I think we're doing a lot right overall
[3209.90 → 3215.42] and uh I think that there's definitely going to be some some some tweaks for us to continue to make i
[3215.42 → 3221.50] think that having the having like the leadership team in to kind of help focus on the business
[3221.50 → 3227.82] things that need to be done so that I can do what I do best which is focus on the content has overall been
[3227.82 → 3234.70] a very good thing even though it's been it's been a learning curve it's been a learning curve I had uh
[3234.70 → 3239.18] honestly uh yeah I mean whatever I might as well just say i had a know
[3244.78 → 3252.70] somewhat short conversation with another member of the leadership team this morning you know this
[3252.70 → 3262.38] morning yep we kind of we kind of chatted through um you know what my expectations were
[3262.38 → 3271.10] in about a certain thing and like what their expectations were and how we both probably didn't
[3271.10 → 3278.46] meet each other's expectations in a way that was conducive to putting forward the best work that we both
[3278.46 → 3286.94] could together um, and it was constructive that's good, but that's the thing is nobody's perfect yeah
[3287.82 → 3292.78] nobody's perfect yeah i I speaking of the nobody's perfect thing like I said we're always going
[3292.78 → 3297.42] to make mistakes as a company there's always going to be you know I don't know we're going to do our
[3297.42 → 3302.46] best it needs to be better than it is right now but there's always going to be some line here that you
[3302.46 → 3309.10] know uh core ultra five there's always going to be that in every once in a while like it's nobody's
[3309.10 → 3316.30] perfect right, but community wanted that from us for a while so I've I've been in this honestly toxic
[3316.30 → 3325.42] habit of checking the LTT Subreddit once every couple days in this like what thing is being why are we
[3325.42 → 3332.62] being called demonic entities this time, and it's been a nice shift in the last few months when it's
[3332.62 → 3340.70] just actually like lol some meme or like hey this video is pretty cool, and it's like oh we're not evil
[3340.70 → 3346.78] well I think by and large they figured out that's great they figured out that um we're like mostly
[3346.78 → 3354.62] trying it's just it was yeah yeah it's its a lot nicer and I'm you know again I'm not expecting
[3354.62 → 3361.02] people to not give constructive or critical feedback when there is constructive or critical
[3361.02 → 3371.10] feedback to give etc they just it was popular and welcomed and praised to crap on us
[3371.10 → 3375.90] for like a year oh it still is in some places depending where you go to be fair yeah yeah it's
[3375.90 → 3380.94] it's like it's kind of comical at this point because it's like yeah there are certain
[3380.94 → 3384.94] do you have any idea what other kinds of entities there are in the world that you could direct this
[3384.94 → 3391.50] energy at like are you even are you even trying to find something to be legitimately angry about
[3391.50 → 3398.70] at this point are you just like have you ever thought about food some random yeah oh man yeah
[3400.30 → 3406.94] looked at what goes in your food oh wow have you ever looked into palm oil you know like
[3406.94 → 3414.14] do you know do you know what canola oil stands for no um I looked this up recently
[3417.98 → 3418.46] where is it
[3423.90 → 3429.82] where's its actual name what now it's like Canada oil or something like no way yeah
[3429.82 → 3439.82] um I think you made that up canola oil get its name from it stands for Canada oil low acid no way
[3439.82 → 3446.94] yeah a name created by a Canadian industry group of rapeseed oil product producers the canola plant
[3446.94 → 3451.42] is a type of rapeseed that is low in two compounds that when removed makes its oil healthier and taste
[3451.42 → 3455.98] better probably because saying the name of the seed just sucks why would they come up with something
[3455.98 → 3460.70] that makes sense yeah that makes sense made out of orphan killing plant
[3462.38 → 3468.06] yeah i would want to rename that first maybe we should uh go back to the marketing table
[3468.06 → 3473.98] you know that would get renamed superfast very quickly i would this oil it's gonna it's gonna
[3476.38 → 3482.70] it's going to oil you in the mouth don't worry whoa, whoa let's let's let's rename that yeah lets's
[3482.70 → 3487.98] rename that but we oil into some announcements man yeah um is that what we're supposed to be doing
[3487.98 → 3493.18] did we do two merch messages we did one merch message for 45 minutes, and now we're going to do
[3493.18 → 3499.74] the announcements and then probably move on to another topic oh wow okay, okay announcements I can
[3499.74 → 3507.42] see the Reddit threads now we're already back to being evil again yeah it's and it's a new r word um so why
[3507.42 → 3516.70] why don't you grab a why don't you grab a hoodie okay because I think it's time to relax and get cozy
[3518.78 → 3527.74] we went all in on making your new favourite hoodie the aptly named super soft hoodie it's made of a
[3527.74 → 3534.62] buttery smooth fabric that our fashion team absolutely fell in love with along with a brushed fleece inside
[3534.62 → 3542.54] that feels luxuriously soft it also features a custom big chunk draw cord with a LTT logo engraved
[3542.54 → 3546.78] in the end that adds a nice little accent hold on I'm going to go to the Luke cam you want to show them
[3546.78 → 3554.30] the big chunk no too comfy oh my god okay um he's really going to be like that about it would big chunk
[3554.30 → 3560.14] I wasn't even paying attention the big chunk draw cord oh these are sweet yeah sure yeah there's the big
[3560.14 → 3564.70] so they're like actually huge yeah like the metal at the end is its she's Chong she's Chong
[3564.70 → 3569.74] do we have done we have an example of like a normal sweater I don't know because these are actually
[3569.74 → 3574.62] like I have big hands fingers that's my finger next to it yeah they're chunky they're chunky you'll
[3574.62 → 3581.58] have to take my word for it um and of course we have a nice soft change pocket to stick your hands into
[3581.58 → 3587.26] and something that we go out of our way to add on our hoodies a more secure pocket for your phone or
[3587.26 → 3591.82] earbuds you want to show them our classic phone pocket there it is basically we wanted to make
[3591.82 → 3595.98] a hoodie that you didn't even have to think twice about throwing on we even chose a colour that works
[3595.98 → 3602.30] with just about any outfit like if you throw the tech bro vest on top of this guy you're looking snazzy
[3602.30 → 3612.14] and warm oh okay he's going to do that it's available now at leg.GG slash super soft which this is
[3612.14 → 3616.46] apparently a thing I had to get educated this is a thing huh I didn't know that people wore
[3617.34 → 3621.74] vests over sweaters okay yeah it's called a sweater vest what are you an idiot no it's not it's not
[3621.74 → 3626.38] called that sweater vest is a thing it's a vest that's a sweater so yeah tech bro he's going to be
[3626.38 → 3631.58] boiling in like four seconds I'm going to overheat he'll wear it for as long as he can and die yeah
[3631.58 → 3635.66] we're in the studio we're under the lights it's not it's not a good time for a warm boy like Luke to
[3635.66 → 3641.74] be wearing something like that how quickly do you think Emma will steal this oh no i I were you
[3641.74 → 3648.54] there Dan will it even make it inside the door the second I even felt it I told arty was here and I was

[3789.50 → 3794.94] he just walked in and I shook his hand what's this for what did I disapprove you know it's time for
[3794.94 → 3800.22] some big changes what are you doing with my desk just go check out these teasers I would have never
[3800.22 → 3805.66] gotten into it if it wasn't for watching LTT I did not get hired because of this script that's going to
[3805.66 → 3811.18] be the best part about this so then I got hired in logistics if Elijah wins he gets a lunch given by me
[3811.18 → 3816.30] and paid for by the company if alliance wins he saves 25 because no one gets lunch
[3819.34 → 3824.38] and immediately found a spelling mistake in like the first sentence and I'm like when a tech link
[3824.38 → 3831.98] officially launched probably launched between like 2005 and 2024. Questions about the content yeah I did
[3831.98 → 3837.82] I did, and he still got it wrong you're asking me also about the content 12 years ago it's our popular

[4154.22 → 4159.66] is now Luke's laptop so you can send it over to the main screen ready oh I understand nope
[4159.66 → 4168.62] that's mine all right neat new AI experiences for paint and notepad okay so paint version 11.2410.28.0
[4168.62 → 4174.54] yeah you couldn't have just fantastic yeah sure uh generative fill a powerful new creation tool
[4174.54 → 4177.66] designed to help make your artistic process more fun and intuitive
[4180.14 → 4187.82] okay now that is bliss and this is actually this is our demo right like we did this
[4187.82 → 4191.82] this isn't uh no, no this is on Microsoft's website this is what no I'm just learning I'm
[4191.82 → 4196.78] I'm learning about it first don't learn if you don't like what was generated just press try again
[4197.58 → 4203.10] wow it will be available on snapdragon powered copilot plus pcs blah blah sign in your Microsoft
[4203.10 → 4212.22] account etc oh generative erase okay make it look like the object was never there very cool
[4212.22 → 4220.06] so let's see boopity gone let's go update the co-creator okay notepad I don't know if I care
[4220.06 → 4224.46] as much about let's play around with paint it shall we Luke do you want to be the was
[4225.18 → 4232.30] what oh um okay so what should we what should we put in it what should we put in it uh I want to play
[4232.30 → 4238.54] with it get it to generate your car generate my car how the devil am I going to get it to do that
[4238.54 → 4252.70] generate the world's most flashy self-important Porsche that you can that you that it can
[4256.70 → 4262.86] really Luke okay well we'll have to start with image creator than okay rather than the actual
[4262.86 → 4268.14] generative fill features whoops let's click the wrong one again okay so image creator uh
[4269.34 → 4274.86] man I haven't really used paint much you know lately yeah I was kind of wondering like will
[4274.86 → 4280.06] this feature get people to actually use paint again because i I feel like paint's kind of
[4280.06 → 4282.38] bit of a dead meme so it was notepad to be honest but
[4285.66 → 4292.22] okay so I want a Porsche Tynan with a brand wrap I mean that's yeah that's what I drive right perfect so
[4292.22 → 4295.74] let's see what it comes up with i I don't think it's going to come up with anything this is like a
[4295.74 → 4302.22] licensed you know thing potentially wow it's it needs a second here give it a second
[4302.22 → 4303.66] we're generating we're generating
[4306.30 → 4315.58] okay all right yeah i mean yeah that's that's pretty good okay well here lets because
[4315.58 → 4319.42] we didn't we didn't say like yeah we didn't say the colour let's say it's purple
[4319.42 → 4326.46] that that that's pretty good that is pretty that is pretty good that's a very strong start we didn't
[4326.46 → 4331.90] say it was purple we also didn't say what skin it looks like a car with a weird custom it's got kind
[4331.90 → 4338.62] of uh similar headlights it's missing the like cheetah tear thing a little bit it gives you Porsche
[4338.62 → 4346.62] vibes though oh yeah def oh 100 okay yeah that one does too okay, okay sure uh okay purple um
[4346.62 → 4352.06] textured Damascus steel cool we're getting close yeah we're getting more specific
[4353.34 → 4359.82] brand wrap okay man that that's not bad okay so let's get our let's get our base image here and then we
[4359.82 → 4370.30] can, and then we can do some generative fill maybe we could put a person in the thing or like
[4370.30 → 4380.70] make your wheels the face whoa, whoa okay which one do we like the best I feel like that first
[4380.70 → 4386.78] one's like getting kind of close I feel like this one's cooler I do feel like that one's cooler dude
[4386.78 → 4393.34] that that's super cool I just think that one's more accurate you know okay all right that one's
[4393.34 → 4398.70] got some wacky glitches going on yeah look at this uh look at this situation here yeah I think the wheel
[4398.70 → 4403.98] is like in the headlight kind of all right okay so we're going to go with this guy sure or the
[4403.98 → 4408.14] cool one i just I think this one's more accurate that one's pretty sick they're both cool let's go
[4408.14 → 4413.10] with this one let's go with this one okay so uh we're going to put you in it or should you be like
[4413.10 → 4418.14] crouching in front of it well I don't know Luke I don't know I describe what you'd like to create
[4418.14 → 4425.74] uh okay, so style wait no this is generated art preview image creator co-creator okay well wait do i how
[4425.74 → 4432.30] how do i uh how do I do any of this I guess I could have Dan do you know uh no I assume that
[4432.30 → 4436.30] what you would do is you would do a lasso like uh you've got the selection tool there if you do the
[4436.30 → 4441.26] drop down and then go like uh free form there we go and then like highlight something so I'm gonna
[4441.26 → 4446.38] I'm going to ask to put a person like there I guess sure yeah generator filter if you hit the button
[4446.38 → 4453.66] uh just underneath the lasso there you go so you could erase or generate film wow that's nice and
[4453.66 → 4460.62] intuitive I just guessed yeah I do it describe what you'd like to add like uh, uh okay uh person's
[4461.34 → 4469.50] head driving this car okay sure create yeah she's uh she's cooking doing something she's cooking
[4469.50 → 4477.42] I feel like it's too slow to engage the children maybe not any okay part of the
[4481.02 → 4490.30] that could be part of the fun now it looks like they're like in the not in the driver's seat well
[4491.98 → 4496.54] technically I didn't say they need to be in the driver's seat they're not really in any seat
[4496.54 → 4500.78] they're kind of in the middle of the car yeah me before coffee they could be
[4502.86 → 4509.98] they're like sitting on the armrest kind of i need that as a profile picture it's going to be my
[4509.98 → 4521.18] new team's profile picture oh they're so good I didn't say that he needed to be looking at the road
[4521.18 → 4528.30] oh he's looking at a lot of roads yeahs uh okay well yeah hold on let's give it let's give it
[4528.30 → 4533.18] another try let's give it another try okay, okay hold on where's my where's my lasso here okay um
[4533.74 → 4535.50] so let's do a let's give her the old
[4539.66 → 4545.02] okay so we're going to generate oh right right right right okay here we go um
[4545.02 → 4554.46] um okay um a couple put an uh okay dinosaur made out of bread driving a typical Porsche driver
[4555.34 → 4566.06] in the driver's seat and his sugar baby in the passenger seat come on local FYI that's why it's
[4566.06 → 4571.42] slow I'm I'm embracing the stereotypes okay I'm super down what uh oh
[4573.74 → 4580.38] what am I looking at what was the prompt wasn't it supposed to be two people oh who is this guy
[4580.38 → 4586.22] it's mostly just a smear I think who is this guy I think he's got like pouty lip and like a giant
[4586.22 → 4592.46] moustache that really does look like the world's largest moustache it's cyclops upset yeah okay
[4592.46 → 4598.46] I like to take it back to for sure because the heated seats don't work wow so that just I think
[4598.46 → 4605.90] I think the smaller lasso was definitely the play is chilly okay what what what some of it I feel like
[4605.90 → 4609.02] a poor oh, oh I want a cool hood ornament
[4615.58 → 4618.06] I'm sorry the wealthy don't have chilled buns
[4618.06 → 4621.66] my buns are seat temperature
[4623.90 → 4632.46] okay unacceptable oh website again a super cool and classy
[4633.34 → 4639.50] oh apparently there's a try again button oh yeah I probably should have used that that's a good idea
[4640.46 → 4642.94] so what are you doing a hood oh well
[4642.94 → 4648.54] mm-hmm to be fair you did kind of put it in a did circle kind of a weird spot for a hood
[4648.54 → 4652.70] ornament well no I wanted it to be coming in right here I don't know it's kind of you circled way
[4652.70 → 4657.82] above yeah he's kind of she's he's kind of sitting on there I mean you could put a hood ornament there
[4657.82 → 4664.30] sure I just needed a second one it's technically on the hood whoops is it on the fender oh shoot
[4664.30 → 4671.90] i I control zed, and it didn't oh yeah yeah I think it's sitting kind of here yeah yeah no for sure
[4671.90 → 4678.54] so okay though can I tell it to well here I'm co-create co-creator image can I tell it to like
[4678.54 → 4687.42] get another one you know like uh here like can I just like grab this and oh hey it's still painted
[4687.42 → 4693.66] yep okay well no that's fine that's fine i i I can use paint here we go what about second one
[4694.30 → 4699.58] there we go okay so hold on I've got a plan for this though remove the background there's a plan
[4699.58 → 4708.94] yeah yeah so I'm gonna just give it the old member oh yep well oh what oh man the okay
[4710.22 → 4711.18] yeah here we go uh
[4714.46 → 4723.90] good luck with this okay but oh uh okay I think I'm about to remove something remove just removes
[4724.30 → 4729.58] uh
[4729.58 → 4737.34] I mean you know um from far enough away you know you're pretty far you have to go pretty far away
[4737.34 → 4744.22] you have to go pretty far away from far enough away you have now hit the bird yeah well uh oh I need a
[4744.22 → 4751.66] license plate okay I need a license plate on the front because i um, and after you do the license plate I think
[4751.66 → 4757.34] I'm officially bored yeah that's fair yeah next you get to check out notepad which would be even
[4757.34 → 4763.98] more exciting no I'm not doing that I can do that did you want me to do that do we have to do that
[4763.98 → 4768.94] though I like a lot oh wow I understand it's not as I didn't realize that it was local that doesn't
[4768.94 → 4772.46] seem very impressive good I will someone in flow plane jazz said it is I don't I'm not pretty sure
[4772.46 → 4779.98] it is this is a snapdragon yep which is so like that's cool I like local of this stuff that's awesome
[4779.98 → 4785.50] so even if it's not as good that's fine I mean it's pretty cool yes that's a license plate on the
[4785.50 → 4791.02] car sure is that's a hood ornament it's also on the car that first face might have been a little cursed
[4791.02 → 4796.54] but it did kind of look like it was a guy sort of he was in the car somewhere I mean yeah he might
[4796.54 → 4801.90] have had the shifter like just wedged between his butt cheeks but um he's not going anywhere yeah
[4801.90 → 4806.22] that's safe that's it for safety yep what if you got in a crash you don't want it to accidentally go
[4806.22 → 4811.82] backwards when you meant to go forward yeah yeah that's why you got to look both ways at the same
[4811.82 → 4813.82] time like that guy that's right that's right
[4818.86 → 4824.22] yeah he's safe he's a safe driver so um notepad seriously is there anything to that is important to
[4824.22 → 4827.98] look at a notepad I don't know it does like gender-driven stuff if you want to just like
[4827.98 → 4832.14] talk about it, you can show it I don't know if it's here's what I'm curious about why are we putting
[4832.14 → 4837.58] development into notepad and killing WordPad why didn't we just kill notepad and make WordPad better
[4837.58 → 4841.18] like what was what was the rationale here maybe someone from Microsoft anyone from Microsoft in
[4841.18 → 4848.70] the chat do you want to tell me why notepad was the focus please anyone be like they killed the
[4848.70 → 4855.90] WordPad because it was probably harder to maintain you think so, and then they were able to just ignore
[4855.90 → 4859.82] notepad because there was nothing going on so it wasn't gonna break, but they aren't ignoring notepad
[4859.82 → 4865.74] they're like making I'm saying why they made that decision in the past oh maybe but then
[4867.26 → 4874.38] people like me, I know it's been very exclusively very committed relationship style using notepad plus
[4874.38 → 4882.94] plus for like a decade and will never go back so just like WordPad I know it was I know they killed
[4882.94 → 4889.74] it because it was too close to word but I needed a way to open docs without yeah having word like
[4889.74 → 4895.02] they're just pushing me straight into the arms of Google for one time in the last 12 years I've had
[4895.02 → 4899.98] to open a Word document I don't have word installed I have no reason to have word installed I would still
[4899.98 → 4904.22] like to be able to open this document yeah that's what WordPad was for yeah it was fine it was not bloat
[4904.22 → 4911.74] it was fine open docs is a thing yeah that's fine but the only reason I don't have word is because
[4911.74 → 4916.06] I'm just setting up this computer so I don't want to install any software I just want to open this
[4916.06 → 4920.38] bloody document because it has the serial for the piece of software that I'm installing or something
[4920.38 → 4928.78] like it's just I don't know all right let's do another topic yeah so yeah ms paint it's something
[4928.78 → 4935.58] Luke what do you want to do AMD rockets forward yeah let's do it according to mercury research AMD's
[4935.58 → 4942.94] desktop CPU market share has climbed 10 in the last year this has manifested most clearly in widespread
[4942.94 → 4950.38] reports that the dozen 7 9800 x3d has sold out at retailers throughout Europe and North America and i
[4950.38 → 4956.06] mean I'm not surprised if you ask anyone what CPU they should get if they're a gamer they say whatever the
[4956.06 → 4964.62] like best x3d chip is and that's just what it's been for a while um anyway uh they have apparently
[4964.62 → 4970.86] sold out within minutes on Amazon and Best Buy wow uh new egg has claimed that they are out of
[4970.86 → 4976.86] individual units of the 9800 x3d but they are for some unexplained reason still offering the
[4976.86 → 4982.62] 9800 x3d plus motherboard bundles that's not an unexplained reason at all I can explain that they need
[4982.62 → 4993.42] to sell motherboards yep and AMD in there probably they're regretting it now um AMD in their sort of
[4993.42 → 5002.70] um time of being necessarily pro-consumer um created this expectation of their motherboard sockets lasting
[5002.70 → 5008.46] for a very long time so they've created this environment where they launch a new CPU and there's
[5008.46 → 5018.06] absolutely no accessory attach sales just new CPUs yep um so new is like yeah you're buying
[5018.06 → 5022.14] motherboard and a lot of times ram some of their bundles have motherboards and ram that's how they
[5022.14 → 5027.82] get you yeah uh further there have been recent reporting that AMD's data centre business unit
[5027.82 → 5033.42] has started out selling Intel for the first time in its history though this comes with some caveats
[5033.42 → 5042.22] roughly a billion of AMD's 3.5 billion in data centre sales is accounted for by uh machine learning
[5042.22 → 5050.78] machine learning me uh accelerators and an area that intel doesn't particularly compete in uh without
[5050.78 → 5057.90] that key one billion dollars intel's 3.3 billion remains the top spot intel knows I've I've heard I didn't
[5057.90 → 5063.26] dive into it, I've heard the the the most recent gen of intel server processors are actually quite good
[5063.26 → 5069.74] despite their consumer stuff being uh intel knows that they have messed up um I think it would be
[5069.74 → 5074.62] pretty hard to not know that at this point but okay um intel knows that they messed up in an interview
[5074.62 → 5080.78] with hot hardware VP of technical marketing Robert Wallick acknowledged the launch of arrow lake didn't
[5080.78 → 5087.66] go as planned citing a series of issues uh the company has now identified at an OS level and
[5087.90 → 5095.42] at the bios level um and saying that the performance we saw in reviews to be very clear no
[5095.42 → 5104.14] fault of reviewers was not what we expected and not what we intended um can I interject for a moment
[5106.14 → 5115.34] the expectation that you're referring to as not what you expected or as I've been or as I've come to
[5115.34 → 5120.30] know it whenever it doesn't matter the point is this is good I can't remember the copy past i have
[5120.30 → 5127.74] like 300 confirmed kills yeah yeah yeah you little sorry another copy past don't worry about it um
[5127.74 → 5133.74] the point is what are you talking about yeah that that whole line was like what
[5133.74 → 5145.34] if you guys didn't have partner boards and you guys can't like to launch a game and like
[5146.54 → 5154.30] no offence to our team but compared to the kinds of engineering resources oh yeah that intel can afford
[5154.30 → 5163.58] we're just a bunch of random bumble**KS playing with gaming computers like what if you guys can't
[5164.54 → 5172.78] contact gigabyte or MSI or Asus be like hey bro do you mind sending over a motherboard so we can
[5172.78 → 5180.14] put a CPU in it and maybe open an f**king game and see if it like gets some fps the tools for evaluating
[5180.14 → 5188.78] this stuff they're all free what are you talking about to be clear I believe him I believe that
[5188.78 → 5194.14] this whole thing was super rushed I mean and I believe that they absolutely didn't do the
[5194.14 → 5199.50] planning that they needed to execute this launch the way that they needed to execute we did not get
[5199.50 → 5208.94] the 265k yeah we had to go buy one after the fact which to be clear that's I can afford yeah i I went i
[5208.94 → 5215.58] bought I bought 10 7800x3ds or whatever it was the problem is the availability the problem is that
[5215.58 → 5221.66] our job is to bring you guys information about these products so that you can make an informed decision
[5221.66 → 5229.42] and intel didn't deem it f**king necessary to send us probably the most compelling chip in the entire stack
[5230.22 → 5238.46] so our launch day review just doesn't have any data for it over what like
[5239.58 → 5245.66] seriously like bomb cost of this chip what because so many people are going to need to buy
[5245.66 → 5254.54] them just send us like send us like 80 bucks worth of sand and heat spreader so we can have the
[5254.54 → 5259.58] numbers for the people if it's really that important to you, we can send it back yeah really honestly
[5259.58 → 5270.78] what were you thinking sending us the 245k and the 285k and not the middle of the road what were you
[5270.78 → 5276.30] thinking bud yeah yeah this didn't go as planned
[5276.30 → 5283.58] the performance we saw in reviews was not what we expected dude the last minute changes that we were
[5283.58 → 5289.90] getting when maybe what they expected two years ago from this launch maybe I don't know but if that
[5289.90 → 5293.82] expectation was set any time even sort of recently like what are you talking about
[5301.50 → 5309.34] uh anyway um yeah I don't even notice this our own notes have despite their own arrow lake launch
[5309.34 → 5316.54] benchmarks highlighting the new flagship losing to the 14 900k 9950x and 7950x3d
[5316.54 → 5324.46] and then we have links to their slides like yeah like this it was my understanding that they knew
[5324.46 → 5328.38] this doesn't make much sense I didn't want to talk about like meetings that we had from them but like
[5328.38 → 5337.66] like what is this statement here we go where's uh yeah they're literally like yeah we're on par but
[5337.66 → 5345.50] like lower power, and also we like to lose at a lot of games which it's like okay but like personally i
[5345.50 → 5349.74] think that's fine it's just not exciting for me to buy it but like you know if you're like hey this
[5349.74 → 5354.22] is a massive generational change for us, we didn't take as much of a step forward performance wise as we
[5354.22 → 5358.86] had hoped, but we saved a ton on power, and we're hoping that uh we're able to you know but like
[5358.86 → 5366.70] literally here's your slide then sure you lose in five games, and you win in four like stop is three
[5367.74 → 5372.62] no, no this one counts is that a play oh they didn't make it blue all these other ones are blue
[5372.62 → 5382.46] I don't know dude I don't know okay sure it's a lot of really nice praise for our graphs
[5382.46 → 5389.18] lately um and especially that that last video so you know shout out um yeah shout out Sammy other
[5389.18 → 5393.90] more different Sammy than the last Sammy that I shouted out today um shout out the team for
[5393.90 → 5401.26] making graphs that are better than intel can make yeah boom roasted yeah because intel is kind of a big
[5401.26 → 5406.94] company I mean not as big as they used to be, but they're big well what what maybe they
[5406.94 → 5411.58] maybe they shouldn't have mantled and sell extreme tech upgrade maybe that was where it all went
[5411.58 → 5415.90] down downhill honestly that was the beginning of the end I think the timeline of
[5415.90 → 5420.78] that lines up pretty well yep if they had just if they had just stuck with intel extreme tech upgrade
[5420.78 → 5428.06] this never would have happened yep this is zen kitty says salty liners I'm not salty AMD picked it up
[5428.06 → 5431.66] right where they left off and uh I don't know if we've ever told AMD this, but they pay more
[5433.26 → 5438.14] well what it was an established series by that point intel had the benefit of that they took a risk on it
[5438.14 → 5442.38] yeah and then when AMD picked it up it was like well we know this is an absolute banger so uh
[5443.34 → 5448.06] time to pony up yeah so yeah it makes sense I feel like we've always been pretty open about that
[5448.06 → 5456.70] yeah no man i I don't know we're we're we're we're a highly transparent company and um you know some
[5456.70 → 5462.62] people will attack us for that they'll, they'll look for points of they'll look for gaps in the armour
[5462.62 → 5467.42] and they'll kind of try and try and wedge something in there and I think but I think most people I think
[5467.42 → 5473.74] the silent majority sees what we do and sees what we're what we're willing to talk about and kind
[5473.74 → 5477.98] of goes okay yeah I think i I think I have the measure of whom these guys are and what they're about
[5477.98 → 5484.78] and that that's the way it is I mean look I've made it very clear at every stage that I'm not friends
[5484.78 → 5491.50] with any of these corporations that we cover I never will be and this is transactional they
[5492.14 → 5497.58] want exposure on our channel exposure to our audience we clearly disclose what is paid
[5498.70 → 5503.26] and that's it there's your talking points it's separate from our opinions
[5504.70 → 5510.62] it's all on it's on the up and up uh what else do we want to talk about today oh this is so cool
[5511.26 → 5520.78] this is so cool YouTuber bough RCC has created a custom PCB add-on and swappable
[5520.78 → 5531.42] SSD modules for m series macBooks this is so cool check this out okay uh blah blah the design
[5531.42 → 5535.66] isn't finalized it requires a second mac to run apple configurator to complete the setup because
[5535.66 → 5541.98] I don't know apple hates their customers who know but the DIY m.2 port was demonstrated to take modules
[5541.98 → 5548.62] up to two terabytes and hit similar speeds to apple's own soldered storage because of course it
[5548.62 → 5554.62] does because it's all just hooked up to PCIE anyway these days because that's what everybody's using for
[5554.62 → 5562.06] everything and this distinction between oh special apple SSD and other more different SSD is completely
[5562.06 → 5569.42] unnecessary other than so that they can sell you a SSD upgrade for 200 for like 19 worth of NAND
[5570.14 → 5575.26] anyway bough found that strangely the macBook requires the SSD to be installed in order for
[5575.26 → 5579.26] the battery to charge which they said was just another reason why the SSD should be replaceable
[5579.26 → 5585.98] currently apple charges the same amount for two 16 gigs ram slash 256 gig storage mac minis as it
[5585.98 → 5590.78] does for a single Mac mini with twice the amount of ram and storage so literally it's costing you twice
[5590.78 → 5596.94] as much to just upgrade the ram and storage as an entire machine with half as much ram and storage
[5597.90 → 5604.46] now this is cool uh curiously there was that the posts about that had a lot of traction curiously it
[5604.46 → 5611.42] seems that the new m4 Mac mini does have a single removable storage module however mac rumours notes
[5611.42 → 5616.30] that it's likely that the controller for the storage is still embedded in the SOC limiting DIY upgrade and
[5616.30 → 5621.34] repair similar modules have been found in the mac studio and the mac pro anyway i just wanna i just
[5621.34 → 5632.22] wanna show this is so cool I hate that this innovation which is super cool is necessary
[5632.22 → 5641.18] I don't understand why apple hates their customers so much and I don't understand why their customers
[5641.18 → 5649.10] continue to bend over and take it and be happy about it but the modding is really cool and I've enjoyed that
[5649.10 → 5655.34] on this show and in the last show we've been able to highlight some cool community dodders that are
[5655.34 → 5659.50] finding ways oh sorry sorry sorry his mod was on the macBook that's the Mac mini replaceable module from apple
[5659.50 → 5663.74] sorry sorry sorry oh that was the wrong pick I was showing hold on I'll find it
[5664.38 → 5673.82] my bad you guys uh I have something to go over when you after you find that yeah I thought that didn't
[5673.82 → 5682.14] look right I hadn't seen the uh I hadn't seen the m4 mac thing, yet you muted me yeah you played that audio
[5682.14 → 5687.10] oh yeah yeah yeah i I hadn't seen the uh I hadn't seen the m4 Mac mini one yet but I thought that man
[5687.10 → 5694.38] that's not what that thing looked like is it yeah here it is dude so cool you guys got to go watch this
[5694.94 → 5699.42] uh here Dan do you want to throw the link in everything but float plane chat I'll throw it in
[5699.42 → 5709.18] uh float plane chat bookmark this go watch it later dude how cool is that yeah love it sick I'll check that out
[5709.18 → 5715.90] yeah okay you brought up our graphs looking nice, and then you thought they were better than intel's
[5715.90 → 5719.98] well I mean it's not that I think they're better than you said it's that intel hates their graphs
[5719.98 → 5724.94] aggressively they're unhappy that we're better at intel everything that intel does that we also do
[5724.94 → 5730.70] um kidding um can my iPhone just like chill out and stop interfering with my mic yeah
[5731.34 → 5736.46] um okay I think I'm done with the iPhone I'm wondering yeah when are you switching off you said I shot
[5736.46 → 5745.98] the video today oh yeah video shot um okay witness you got some you got some silver spray paint yeah yeah
[5745.98 → 5754.22] yeah uh I'm interested in your thoughts in how much this adds or doesn't add to the video okay all right
[5754.86 → 5755.10] okay
[5758.78 → 5764.70] did you see no watch keep watching keep watching wait for the next one he's I'm sure he's
[5764.70 → 5771.98] just talking right now yeah whoa you see what do you think if it's very little work what are your
[5771.98 → 5774.14] thoughts then it's super cool oh
[5777.10 → 5783.66] yeah if it's very much work do you think would be defined as very little work um
[5785.10 → 5790.62] like having the basically having the graph be adamant like this one so the phone that we're actually
[5790.62 → 5796.86] talking about gets like kind of inserted in yeah like that so here's my thing um I think if you have
[5796.86 → 5804.46] a video that has I would say less than half a dozen graphs then by all means spend the extra 15 minutes
[5804.46 → 5810.78] that it'll take to do this to each one or five minutes or whatever it is if you have a video that's
[5810.78 → 5817.98] like a CPU review and there's 20 30 graphs I forget it the reason why I'm asking is basically when
[5817.98 → 5824.06] labs is exporting yeah uh graphs and charts and stuff it would be exported in a different format
[5825.02 → 5831.10] because it's like okay do we export the AI file so it's modifiable by the editor or do we export just
[5831.10 → 5840.22] like a PNG um I think it looks pretty nice I think it looks pretty nice what you're saying when there's
[5840.22 → 5845.82] when there's like the the most recent CPU video that we did yep like the amount of graphs
[5845.82 → 5850.62] that were in this that could get that could get cumbersome I could see that, and the thing is that
[5851.18 → 5858.46] there's probably a lot there are also a lot of lines I'd say a solid 75 of the time on LTT and I'm
[5858.46 → 5863.50] going to bring up your laptop here I'd say a solid 75 of the time on LTT when we're uploading a really
[5863.50 → 5869.58] graph heavy video it's an embargo video yes we're pushing we are time constrained we're already we're
[5869.58 → 5876.46] already crunching yeah so if you tell me yeah we're going to add something unnecessary we're going to
[5876.46 → 5880.46] animate it we're going to make it pretty we're going to make it shiny I'm going to say give me a really
[5880.46 → 5887.10] perfect reason and I'm sorry but pretty is not a good enough reason in this case I don't think that um
[5889.10 → 5894.54] I don't think that I see a clear enough benefit now if your team can figure out how
[5895.74 → 5901.18] all of that just happens automatically and there's some kind of like slick web interface for
[5902.14 → 5908.22] where you just kind of say like highlight this one, and then it just like runs a magic behind the scenes
[5908.22 → 5912.86] animation thing or something i I don't I don't know this is the one of importance so it does some yeah
[5912.86 → 5917.26] I don't know we can explore that type of stuff that is not what that looked like to me that looked like
[5917.26 → 5920.78] that wasn't I don't believe that was that that looked like after effects or something like that
[5920.78 → 5927.82] I don't know yeah yeah I'm not sure exactly what they used for that gave the file um the only like
[5927.82 → 5933.98] honestly and the other thing too is like there's a little bit of if it ain't broke don't fix it
[5933.98 → 5941.58] in my response as well people are super happy with this there are things that I would do differently um i
[5941.58 → 5950.86] prefer a highlight compared to a dot i prefer a box I vastly prefer a box a red wireframe
[5950.86 → 5956.54] box I don't want to actually highlight it I want it to be around it but I was told that the audience
[5956.54 → 5962.38] largely preferred the dot even though for me the dot is much more difficult to track because it moves
[5962.38 → 5969.66] in multiple on multiple axes yeah um, but you know this is a is one of those cases where I'm not
[5969.66 → 5976.54] just going to I'm not just going to impose my will because at the end of the day who's our boss audience
[5976.54 → 5976.94] two
[5976.94 → 5984.22] just knocking down what I'm setting up you know how to say anything yeah you'll just he'll, you'll just knock
[5984.22 → 5989.82] down everything you know what fine I'm going to give the hints anyway it's not me, and it's not taken
[5989.82 → 5999.90] there go ahead you can do it again it's Dan it's the audience I'm not liking the projections of where
[5999.90 → 6010.78] we're going I want more Luke huh more Luke in videos huh, huh um I'm down put me in coach
[6010.78 → 6022.30] oh I'm going to strike the Sancho okay yeah anyway um yeah no i yeah it's its cool but I just don't I
[6022.30 → 6029.58] just don't see the um man what would I compare this to that I mean that mac address video only had like
[6029.58 → 6034.86] three graphs well that's the thing so yeah it's okay yeah it's um like I could see on a more like
[6034.86 → 6041.42] lifestyle channel they're also really early in the video so that's that's something that you guys
[6041.42 → 6048.54] will now that I'm going to say it you're going to notice it we make much heavier investments in yeah like
[6048.54 → 6056.70] you have to more expensive shots locations props um editing in the first like few minutes of a video
[6056.70 → 6063.26] compared to what we're willing to do toward the end we aren't operating on the kinds of budgets that
[6063.26 → 6069.34] someone like uh you know a Mr beast might or whatever so that every second of the video
[6069.34 → 6074.22] is designed with the expectation that you will be watching it, and you must continue to watch it
[6074.22 → 6079.74] we're just it's its like yeah realistically not everyone is going to be into this doing that
[6079.74 → 6085.02] server network card so we'll do everything we can to hook you and if it doesn't work it doesn't work
[6085.02 → 6091.02] we're kind of we're kind of okay with that protect the server network card from incoming hackers and win
[6091.02 → 6100.54] a million dollars the server network card is in a pit the pit is full of snakes oh there's a train coming
[6101.34 → 6103.66] what are you going to do the train's on fire
[6106.06 → 6111.26] this is just tech support saw now I don't even watch Mr beast videos all of that guessing is just
[6111.26 → 6120.38] from his thumbnails' oh yeah absolutely oh boy your files are stored on the server it's running right
[6120.38 → 6127.42] now you must pull out the hard drive while it's running I hired seven e-cig members to try to break
[6127.42 → 6138.14] into your server room can you keep them out for 24 hours maybe do I get a minigun
[6138.14 → 6145.90] uh all right what are we supposed to be um I don't know we're supposed to be doing topics
[6145.90 → 6152.14] I keep doing topics until we go to after dark I think NVIDIA says a hundred hours of gaming ought to
[6152.14 → 6161.66] be enough for anyone wrong I mean I'm not necessarily news I'm not necessarily proud that they're wrong but
[6161.66 → 6169.18] they are wrong NVIDIA announced a few changes to GeForce now their game streaming service the majority of which were upgrades
[6169.66 → 6176.38] the priority membership tier has been rebranded as performance and will now have a max resolution of 1440p instead of 1080p
[6177.34 → 6184.62] while remaining at ten dollars a month, and it also comes with an ultra-wide option super cool wait a hundred hours monthly oh
[6184.62 → 6190.14] they're like actually wrong people are actually going to be upset about that can you stop getting ahead of things no
[6190.70 → 6199.42] however both the performance tier and the 20 ultimate tier will now have a 100-hour monthly limit which Luke
[6199.98 → 6207.90] spoiled what which NVIDIA says I'm learning about this right now it is doing to avoid global price increases
[6207.90 → 6218.06] because some random people are putting in 200 hours a week the limit works out to just above three
[6218.06 → 6226.46] hours a day which NVIDIA says accommodates 94 of their user base nonetheless some users six percent of them
[6226.46 → 6233.26] uh did the math for them there uh were extremely unhappy and expressed doubt that 94 of GeForce now
[6233.26 → 6240.70] users were using it 100 hours a month or less I have some bad news for you guys NVIDIA is probably not
[6240.70 → 6245.90] lying you actually have a problem you win in those gaming lobbies because you don't do anything else
[6245.90 → 6252.70] yeah um which isn't a problem it's okay to have a problem that's not a problem it's just you can quit
[6252.70 → 6259.74] you can quit anytime you want yeah NVIDIA will charge three dollars for an additional 15 hours of performance
[6259.74 → 6267.58] and six dollars for 15 hours of ultimate so basically you're paying a third you're paying a
[6267.58 → 6275.42] third of your monthly rate for how does that math work it's more expensive oh yeah it's more expensive
[6275.42 → 6280.78] why is it more expensive that's stupid I think it would be less expensive yeah no you think it would
[6280.78 → 6284.62] be more expensive because the other one is subsidized by the people who use it so little no, no that makes
[6284.62 → 6289.74] sense yeah it would be more expensive so that's probably closer to what it actually cost them
[6289.74 → 6294.62] which interestingly probably gives us some insight into the actual math for how much people are
[6294.62 → 6303.66] actually using the service compared to um like if you use it so if they can afford what was it
[6303.66 → 6311.10] a hundred hours a month for 10 bucks and another 15 hours cost them three dollars than basically what
[6311.10 → 6315.18] that means is for every person who's using it a hundred hours you've got people who are barely
[6315.18 → 6320.54] touching it uh in order to subscription using zero hours yeah in order to have that math work out
[6320.54 → 6325.98] uh oh but very, very interesting plus there's some profit margin baked into both calculations probably
[6327.34 → 6338.06] um yep live-streaming is extremely expensive none of this surprises me at all and especially when you
[6338.06 → 6346.06] make it like difficult live-streaming it also doesn't surprise me at all that um you know now that
[6346.06 → 6350.62] you're locked into a subscription service that subscription service would look to alter the deal
[6351.34 → 6361.58] this is why we should probably you know refrain scrapyard wars uh, uh like you know a mediocre pc
[6361.58 → 6366.30] rather than buy into a subscription service that can be oinked on us at any time I thought you're gonna
[6366.30 → 6371.66] said put up the cost of a float plane subscription yeah yeah spend your money on float plane instead
[6371.66 → 6379.26] got them oh how much does wan cost ask Luca 103 a bunch I don't think we know exactly do we oh no you
[6379.26 → 6383.26] do there are ways to figure it out I don't know yeah top of my head it also changes like per episode
[6383.26 → 6388.22] because we'll, we'll stream for two hours then we'll stream for four and a half yeah so like I'm gonna
[6388.22 → 6395.10] start sending it at 40 Meg can you gut sure it is actually like why don't we just do it won't make
[6395.10 → 6402.30] a difference to be honest no twitch will freak out oh, oh yeah well, but that's their problem
[6403.34 → 6408.86] it's not a pro I mean because what we receive from here oh yeah that actually doesn't matter
[6408.86 → 6414.78] oh yeah we transcoded yeah yeah who cares garbage in garbage out though less garbage in less
[6414.78 → 6420.22] garbage out let's do it at 8k wan show that actually reminds me man these c200s have been
[6420.22 → 6426.54] absolute just workhorses yeah here forever yeah we used to use these for like trade shows and stuff
[6426.54 → 6431.18] and uh we ended up not getting a lot of use out of them there, but boy have they ever been great for
[6431.18 → 6439.98] the wan show look at that we got all these camera angles it's like oh I've got a c100 at home uh yeah
[6439.98 → 6445.82] they're indestructible yeah great little cameras yeah yes I think these c200s are like eight grand
[6445.82 → 6451.58] a body though, but you know maybe more there's no way they're worth that any more not any more absolutely
[6451.58 → 6458.86] not okay yeah i I think we did pay quite a lot for them um speaking of quite paying a lot for it
[6459.50 → 6465.10] uh the dough drops intel has been removed from its 25-year position in the Dow Jones industrial
[6465.10 → 6470.86] average I think we hinted to this last week, but it has happened I guess uh the go-to benchmark to
[6470.86 → 6475.98] measure the health of the U.S. stock market being the Dow Jones industrial average uh this likely
[6475.98 → 6480.94] indicates that the maintainers of the Dow Jones believe that intel's recent struggles are skewing
[6480.94 → 6487.90] the average in a way not generally reflective of the market as a whole, and they were like damn we
[6487.90 → 6493.34] can get in video in here, and then they did that its position has been replaced with NVIDIA which the
[6493.34 → 6499.82] S&P Dow Jones indicates apparently views as a more accurate reflection of the chip making sector
[6499.82 → 6504.22] to that I don't necessarily agree with I don't agree with that as much of an anomaly as intel has been
[6504.22 → 6509.02] over the last little bit yeah they're just on the other end of it yeah which I understand why you want
[6509.02 → 6515.58] that but what you're saying just isn't true anyway um so that's a discussion question uh is
[6515.58 → 6523.66] is it really the company that's most reflective of the sector no nice it is a good discussion
[6523.66 → 6530.94] question we just got to it too early um oops a network along your skin researchers at Carnegie
[6530.94 → 6537.02] Mellon university have developed a method of transmitting 40 megahertz RF energy along human skin
[6537.50 → 6545.02] allowing the user to remotely power tiny wearable devices that otherwise could not fit a battery
[6545.02 → 6551.50] such as a patch that logs medical data whoa this power could be delivered from head to toe from a power source
[6551.50 → 6560.14] worn elsewhere on the body startup Ivana has created a prototype yr chip that uses a similar method to send
[6560.14 → 6568.86] Bluetooth slash Wi-Fi signals through the body's skin thereby connecting multiple devices without broadcasting a wider
[6568.86 → 6576.54] potentially insecure signal this would likewise allow users to share a connection
[6579.34 → 6584.94] through skin-to-skin contact except like a handshake or a high five you could literally like handshake
[6584.94 → 6590.78] someone and like exchange contact information whoa like if you had yeah some like wearable modern
[6590.78 → 6599.34] handshakes isn't that cool whoa you touch people says sinful hands I mean yeah well geeks are it's kind of
[6599.34 → 6608.06] funny that yeah someone whose name in chat is sinful hands says ew touch people mm-hmm just kind of works it does it
[6608.06 → 6612.14] works yeah you're not as on as me today I'm sorry
[6612.14 → 6622.54] rude, so the discussion question here is what kinds of wearable devices can you imagine with this
[6622.54 → 6627.50] technology I mean medical ones I think are obvious we can kind of what about embedded ones too
[6628.38 → 6633.10] embedded in the skin well I don't know the signal goes along the skin so you'd almost have to have
[6633.10 → 6636.94] I mean that would be kind of cyberpunk looking right because you'd have all the contacts and traces on the
[6636.94 → 6641.42] surface interesting, and then it's just like you know buried in your muscles somewhere or whatever
[6641.42 → 6645.66] else like an uh man I don't know like could you
[6648.38 → 6654.94] because like if you had a heart rate monitor yeah that didn't increase the bulk along your body
[6655.58 → 6658.22] that could be kind of nice yeah that'd be pretty cool
[6660.54 → 6664.46] Euro amp what do you guys what are you guys talking about yeah if you had a heart rate monitor that was
[6664.46 → 6672.06] powered through you, I guess, and it could maybe like uh remotely transmit to your phone or something
[6672.06 → 6679.34] so you could still check what it's reading be interesting I mean yeah you could say uh powered
[6679.34 → 6687.82] tattoos oh that'd be cool e-ink tattoos that would be so cool okay now people are getting me some
[6687.82 → 6692.94] good ideas here imagine a tattoo that changes based on your heart rate yeah and then
[6692.94 → 6700.78] oh my god yeah you could have like a little display in your inner wrist what about earrings with
[6700.78 → 6706.86] lights on them dude you could have comp yeah that'd be sick you could have complicated like tattoos
[6706.86 → 6714.38] yeah reveal different details based on other powered jewellery or like oh man dude you could have so you
[6714.38 → 6720.06] could have like a necklace that like changes colour with your mood except actually you know not like those
[6720.06 → 6723.90] like cheap mood rings or whatever actually based on something, but that is like actually based on like
[6723.90 → 6729.34] your anxiety level and stuff like that like and sure yeah the privacy issues, but you know people
[6729.34 → 6735.26] would do it you know people would do it internal cardiac monitors dude this is so cool
[6736.22 → 6741.90] I mean my thought is like I'm just surreptitiously touching the back of your neck and stealing all your
[6741.90 → 6745.98] data and stuff like that right like Dan I shake your hand why you have to go there with it
[6745.98 → 6752.94] who you don't even have the courage to show your face telling us all your ideas about stealing other
[6752.94 → 6757.18] people's data, and you can't even okay yeah there he is apparently this is a thing already internal
[6757.18 → 6761.42] cardiac monitors yeah yeah I think, so implantable loop recorders put them in your heart right because
[6761.42 → 6766.54] they just run on like super, super long yeah life batteries I guess um but this is the cool thing
[6766.54 → 6771.26] about it is that you're doing networking and power just over the skin so you just have like a little pack
[6771.26 → 6776.86] on your wrist like where a watch would be, and it could just power and communicate as almost like
[6776.86 → 6780.62] a like a smart home hub like a smart body hub what if it's in your back pocket, and then you just sit
[6780.62 → 6789.26] down on a wireless charging chair whoa yeah butt charging whoa I mean that would probably be actually
[6789.26 → 6798.06] a perfect idea so is that like a stick penalty like if they is the centre gets attacked if the
[6798.06 → 6801.02] quarterback just like runs into the centre
[6807.66 → 6809.66] what are we talking about uh
[6811.50 → 6816.70] anyway um steam moving on yeah steam recording super cool feature
[6818.62 → 6822.70] um steam has officially launched built-in game recording which allows gamers to record their
[6822.70 → 6827.90] sessions without using a second app players can start a recording manually or set it to start
[6827.90 → 6831.66] automatically and there are likewise options to restrict the length quality and storage space
[6831.66 → 6837.02] that steam can use these settings can be configured differently for each game however the accessibility
[6837.02 → 6842.38] of these recording options and the broader audience of steam users might cause problems for users who are
[6842.38 → 6850.54] less familiar with things like SSD degradation as pointed out by u slash crass underscore spectacle steam game
[6850.54 → 6856.70] recording has a max write rate of 50 megabits per second around 22 and a half gigabytes per hour if it
[6856.70 → 6862.78] was used regularly at the highest settings this could cause significant SSD degradation over time
[6863.58 → 6867.98] notably the highest write quality on NVIDIA's own recording feature maxes out at 150 megabits per
[6867.98 → 6873.90] second which is significantly higher but is also something that you generally um is generally a little
[6873.90 → 6879.66] more tech-savvy to access rather than just what you know your kids using the family computer are going to be
[6879.66 → 6884.78] able to figure out how to configure our discussion question is this a realistic concern for most
[6884.78 → 6891.10] people and um I'm of kind of two minds on this on the one hand yes this will compare to how the
[6891.10 → 6897.90] average user is expected to use their pc and what SSD makers have been targeting over the last 10 years
[6897.90 → 6909.50] with the move from SLC to NFC to TLC to PLC to even plc flash um with far, far less endurance as we
[6909.50 → 6914.30] as we move yeah to each new generation but higher capacity meaning that you're less likely to
[6914.30 → 6918.30] overwrite it but then now that we're going to overwrite it we've we've we've been building
[6918.30 → 6922.94] toward we've been building products for this paradigm where people are like kind of occasionally
[6923.50 → 6928.54] copying some footage or downloading a new game but generally speaking are barely even
[6928.54 → 6934.62] touching their drive which is pretty accurate for rights yeah, and then we're adding we're throwing this
[6934.62 → 6940.14] into the mix I think I do think that people who didn't think they needed a premium drive
[6940.14 → 6944.22] with better endurance are going to suddenly find out oh i do need a premium drive with better
[6944.22 → 6951.02] endurance however the other side of me wants to point out that it's been studied a couple of times
[6951.02 → 6956.86] small sample sizes unfortunately so I don't know how reliable and how trustworthy it is, but it's been
[6956.86 → 6961.74] looked at a couple of times by I forget which publications have done it where they've done endurance
[6961.74 → 6966.78] tests on SSDs and found that in general they actually last way longer than what they're rated
[6966.78 → 6972.54] pretty good yeah so i also you when I use uh shadow play I just write to my hard drive
[6974.06 → 6980.62] sorry i just gotta move my leg there we go but yeah yeah you should probably just use a hard drive for
[6980.62 → 6985.98] this yeah in a NAS ideally but most people don't have a NAS I mean they're really very
[6985.98 → 6991.50] true there really hasn't been like a NBA a DIY NAS software that is easy enough to use that uh
[6994.54 → 6998.78] that just anyone who could build their own pc could just install it and be good to go and
[6998.78 → 7002.78] configure everything and i have to cut them up all the shares just work out that's that's the one
[7002.78 → 7010.38] that hopefully theoretically I just invested in promo oh yeah sure that's easy and approachable for
[7010.38 → 7020.30] uh the every man yeah yeah that voice is Dan's like I am screaming inside I am also dying oh
[7020.30 → 7025.34] it's fine I think it's all of my voices that's a sure let's go
[7029.58 → 7031.74] Dan switching it over pushing the buttons
[7031.74 → 7040.46] all right we got a lot of merch messages today oh not too too many I think we're doing
[7040.46 → 7048.54] pretty okay um let's see hey oh DLL notice the Apple Watch accompanying the switch to iPhone
[7048.54 → 7057.58] Linus what do you think of it so far um considering how amped I was on smartwatches at the start like i
[7057.58 → 7066.38] loved my pebble um I have just kind of completely fallen out of love with them, and maybe it's because
[7066.38 → 7074.06] the product category sort of moved away from me maybe it's because I moved away from the product
[7074.06 → 7082.22] category like it feels like at the beginning they were about getting notifications without taking your
[7082.22 → 7087.34] phone out of your pocket and in some cases as they got a little bit more sophisticated
[7087.34 → 7093.02] interacting with those notifications to make them go away and you can still do that like
[7093.02 → 7097.74] being able to get a text while I'm while I'm on the court at the gym or something like that and uh
[7097.74 → 7104.38] you know fire back a quick message uh it's fine it's good but all the like trying to do too much
[7104.38 → 7109.34] all the functionality that they've added since then around you know telling me to stand up but
[7109.98 → 7113.98] sure yeah I can't right now I'm in the middle of I'm in the middle of a podcast recording like
[7113.98 → 7121.66] you know like it doesn't it doesn't have the awareness to just make the cameras the table
[7121.66 → 7126.14] everything we should just make everything stand yeah everything every 45 minutes sure yeah yeah
[7126.14 → 7131.74] let me get let me get right on hell yeah um so all this extra stuff that they've added the
[7131.74 → 7136.46] health tracking it doesn't it's not meaningful to me, I mean when I'm a senior citizen and I'm worried
[7136.46 → 7141.10] about you know fall detection or whatever else yeah maybe I'll be more interested in
[7141.10 → 7144.86] something like that but the health tracking that especially apple has been doing is really cool
[7144.86 → 7148.94] yeah it's really cool I think not necessarily relevant I think proof made a perfect point
[7148.94 → 7153.58] in his uh script where we were talking about their most recent event uh where he was like yeah it's
[7153.58 → 7159.74] funny how the older Tim apple gets the uh the more seniors' health tracking makes its way into their
[7159.74 → 7166.46] products it's also aging generation of absolutely western countries absolutely the most affluent
[7166.46 → 7173.02] generation in the United States is the baby boomers, and they are they're getting older they be old
[7173.02 → 7179.34] they're getting older yeah so i it's nice to be able to tell the time quickly and conveniently on my
[7179.34 → 7185.26] wrist you do that with a lot of things I don't like having to charge it every day that's a downer um
[7186.86 → 7192.62] you notice I'm not wearing it today I just forgot to put it on and I didn't notice until someone asked me
[7192.62 → 7199.50] what time it was that was really the only I don't know maybe part of it is that since I first got a
[7199.50 → 7205.10] smartwatch I just am like on my phone a lot more and that that's that that's probably a bad thing
[7205.10 → 7210.22] maybe I should get in the habit of using my watch to interact with notifications if it got you off
[7210.22 → 7218.30] your phone more often which reduced the total phone and watch usage time than I think that there's value
[7218.30 → 7223.98] there yeah but if you're just replacing phone time with watch time one to one I don't see value there
[7223.98 → 7232.14] personally I don't use any of the other apps like to me the whole um like I am exercising right now
[7232.14 → 7239.02] this is the type of exercise I'm doing until you can just tell that I'm exercising with all of your
[7239.02 → 7247.26] advanced sophisticated measures and uh, uh sensors and everything what are we even doing here like i
[7247.26 → 7253.34] i it's its it to me, it's like counting calories like I'm I'm logging the thing that I'm eating and
[7253.34 → 7258.22] and that's really useful for a lot of people depending on what your goals are like 100 yeah
[7258.22 → 7266.22] yeah 100 depending on your goals that have a ton of value for me, it has I am not even close dude
[7267.26 → 7274.06] I can go take something out of my freezer and think okay I need to go into my food checklist app and
[7274.06 → 7278.46] I need to update the inventory in the freezer and by the time I have put it down on the counter
[7278.46 → 7284.22] I have completely forgotten that I needed to do that expecting me to count calories or remember to
[7284.22 → 7289.34] like log that I'm about to start exercising it's not going to happen the only way I was not going to have
[7289.34 → 7293.66] able to count calories was when I had pre-planned what I was going to eat for the entire day
[7294.38 → 7301.50] and I never deviated because then it was like okay well I could put in my calories for the next week
[7301.50 → 7307.82] you know like it's its figured out already um someone says they really like it for sleep tracking
[7308.22 → 7315.34] um dude if I have to the only way that I can remember to charge something is if it's overnight
[7316.30 → 7323.34] so yeah there's people at work here that have an Apple Watch charger on their desk so they'll take it
[7323.34 → 7327.98] off, and they'll put it on the charger so that they can use it for sleep tracking I would leave my watch
[7327.98 → 7333.02] at work every other day a hundred percent oh yeah there's absolutely no way that it would make it
[7333.02 → 7337.66] home five out of five days in a week I'd probably leave it at your house half the time I visit you
[7337.66 → 7341.50] oh yeah sure dude you would leave your keys at my house if you were able to leave without them like
[7342.06 → 7346.38] yeah 100 that would be a hilarious troll sometimes you just leave your key in your car
[7346.38 → 7352.38] and then just like see if you leave without your keys because i I bet you would probably
[7355.10 → 7355.90] all right what else we got
[7358.54 → 7360.14] okay let's see
[7362.54 → 7368.86] archive hey DLL my friends and I have a long-running tradition during a land party on Black Friday every
[7368.86 → 7374.78] year what are some of your favourite memories games and food to have at a land party Vangelis says new
[7374.78 → 7379.74] watch charges so fast i literally only put it on the charger when I shower and otherwise wear it 24 7.
[7379.74 → 7381.50] bold of you to assume I shower every day
[7385.10 → 7390.22] only exercise days which is at least every it's about two out of every three days so I'm not
[7390.22 → 7397.50] a complete I'm not a complete like barbarian or whatever but um yeah no my life is not routine enough
[7397.50 → 7404.46] for anything that doesn't fit in the very limited routines that I can manage
[7406.22 → 7409.82] um star cat one says shower every day man
[7411.50 → 7418.22] you know you don't have to right just I'm just saying I'm just saying you and it, and it's
[7418.22 → 7423.66] totally fine to shower every day, but you also like don't have to, or maybe you do which is fine
[7423.66 → 7433.74] I'm not judging yeah for me honestly it depends how stressed I get oh stress sweat stinks oh mine
[7433.74 → 7439.98] is I'm sure everyone says but i only really have experience with my mind is brutal dude if I'm just
[7439.98 → 7440.38] chilling
[7442.86 → 7448.14] yeah it's not a big deal slather on another layer of deodorant yeah like probably doesn't really matter
[7448.14 → 7455.42] if I have some like really serious conversations boy I need to shower like it's not it's not an
[7455.42 → 7464.78] option but at a certain point yeah oh man um lan memories games and food dude uh I think it was
[7464.78 → 7470.86] like cod 2 which I had never played um I got a bunch of copies of it from work because there was like a
[7470.86 → 7475.18] cod 2 like GPU bundle, and we didn't move through them all I was like can I have some of these discs
[7475.18 → 7481.26] and they were like okay so I showed up at this land and I had like eight copies of cod 2 and we
[7481.26 → 7485.50] completely lost track of whatever the objective was supposed to be, and we started playing this like
[7485.50 → 7491.50] king of the hill except it was like at the very top of this water tower and there was like over half
[7491.50 → 7496.78] a dozen of us so it was functionally impossible to get to the top of it I think it is happened that
[7496.78 → 7502.30] way because someone got up there unnoticed at some point in the match and just started like spawn
[7502.30 → 7507.66] sniping everybody um, and we were like what the heck that's a good spot I want it and it just
[7507.66 → 7513.82] evolved into the longest like completely no there's no score keeping because it wasn't part of
[7513.82 → 7520.30] the game mode of the game but just the longest most ridiculously impossible king of the hill match
[7520.94 → 7526.78] that I've ever participated in custom goals custom rules all that kind of stuff those are always like
[7526.78 → 7532.78] the best way to play games it's its more fun my favourite land memory and I'm not even gonna
[7532.78 → 7537.50] remember it correctly because it was from so long ago but uh my birthdays when I was in high school
[7537.50 → 7544.78] were always land parties at my parents house and one year we went really hard on halo 2
[7546.06 → 7552.78] custom rules versus and we if I remember correctly we had liked it was a birthday party so we tried to
[7552.78 → 7560.14] go a little bit overboard and we had people bring like couches and TVs and stuff from their houses
[7560.14 → 7565.58] and we put if i I think I'm getting this right I could be wrong I think this is how it worked I think
[7565.58 → 7572.06] we had two TVs and two couches in the garage and two TVs and two couches inside and there was one team
[7572.06 → 7578.46] inside and one team outside, and we had a tournament of halo 2 on one particular map that I'm not gonna
[7578.46 → 7583.74] remember the name of um, and it was either like swords and shotguns or I feel like it was
[7583.74 → 7588.70] swords and rockets but I feel like we played more swords and shotguns but I don't know I don't remember
[7588.70 → 7595.58] why I'm thinking rocket, but it came to it was 49 49 there were two players alive, and it came down to
[7595.58 → 7599.26] the there was one with a sword and one with whatever the other weapon was I think it was a
[7599.26 → 7604.38] rocket and they both attacked at the same time no way nobody knew who won the game until the score
[7604.38 → 7613.98] screen came up no way and the house just exploded it was crazy it was so cool it was so like oh man
[7613.98 → 7621.26] like yeah uh it was great it was really it was very fun and like even every part of that land those
[7621.26 → 7625.50] types of lands are fun because like people are showing up with couches in the backs of their like
[7625.50 → 7630.78] their parents van yeah and their parents are like I don't even understand what's happening but I mean at
[7630.78 → 7636.70] least you're not like doing drugs or something so fine, and then we're like finding ways to network
[7636.70 → 7641.66] these two boxes together, and we're not only planning on playing Xbox we also have another
[7641.66 → 7645.90] network going on for all these computers, and we're all learning how this stuff works buying switches
[7645.90 → 7650.62] from NCI doing whatever getting stuff going like the whole thing's just super fun I don't know those
[7650.62 → 7655.42] were those were good times I feel like kids are kind of missing out on that my son was playing
[7655.42 → 7659.42] rocket league with one of his friends and I was like hey you never invite me to play games he was like okay
[7659.42 → 7664.30] yeah my dad's joining us, and they're like okay sure whatever we'll carry uh you know how bad I am
[7664.30 → 7668.62] at rocket league I did one useful thing though what'd you do I don't know I don't remember I like hit it
[7668.62 → 7672.22] somewhere that was useful, and then we scored oh okay yeah don't worry about it anyway the point is
[7672.78 → 7678.70] um his friend pulled off what's it called a reset or something like that a flip reset sure yeah so he
[7679.26 → 7682.14] you touch your wheels to the puck while it's in the air, and then you get another jump
[7682.70 → 7687.82] I'm assuming that's what happened it so uh it was with the ball it's not a bright I play snow day anyway
[7687.82 → 7691.66] anyway the point is you have to touch all four wheels to the ball while you're in the air and
[7691.66 → 7696.22] then you get another flip while you're in the air which is beneficial in some way or something yeah and
[7699.02 → 7702.94] he was really excited about pulling it off or whatever and um
[7707.74 → 7715.10] he was sitting in his house by himself yeah, and we were on a discord call and so you know that was cool
[7715.10 → 7723.50] but like it's cool it's not the same it's different um yeah I feel like things get diluted right and
[7723.50 → 7726.62] like you think it's the same and a lot of people don't do land parties anymore because they're like
[7726.62 → 7732.30] oh we just play over the internet and stuff, but it's not it's not man and no one can cheat in person
[7733.58 → 7740.38] which man is such a problem online now oh you can, but it's like it's a lot harder not with friends
[7740.94 → 7746.22] like you can, but you won't but like I mean that's yeah and there's even some fun in that because then
[7746.22 → 7750.78] I don't know I find the setup of this type of stuff interesting I know not everyone would but like the
[7750.78 → 7756.22] whole idea of being in the garage and stuff was there is no screen peeking to screen peek you'd have to
[7756.22 → 7761.82] run through the house like it's not happening yeah, but you can still hear each other if you look the
[7761.82 → 7767.34] door is propped open so you can see each other yeah, but the screens are this way to each other right so you
[7767.34 → 7772.54] you can't, you can't see the screens, but you can yell at each other and do whatever yeah it's good
[7772.54 → 7783.34] times yeah all right hey DLL how's your day going it's been a long week it's been it's been a week
[7784.14 → 7789.42] when and what are your plans for bonus pin items I have so many stickers yes I could just get more sticks
[7789.98 → 7795.10] uh hope you feel better soon Linus um I don't know I think we want to do some like little vinyl figures at
[7795.10 → 7801.50] one point I know we're going to do more pins final figures um honestly Sarah would know this so much
[7801.50 → 7806.94] better than me maybe next time ask when she does like a design stream or something like that because
[7806.94 → 7809.74] she's she's in the know when it comes to all of that
[7815.74 → 7822.94] are you asking her now should I move on no, no I'm I'm i Sarah's off work now hey LLD from Australia
[7822.94 → 7828.62] any thoughts on the 9800 x3d not being in stock anywhere was the release rushed in your opinion
[7828.62 → 7835.74] not nearly as rushed as core ultra 200 series but um I feel like every product release gets kind of
[7835.74 → 7840.70] crunched and rushed to a certain extent it's at a certain point you have to you're working with
[7840.70 → 7843.50] retail partners you're working with all these other people there has to be a certain point in
[7843.50 → 7849.34] time when you launch the thing yeah there's deadlines and no I mean it's easier to not have
[7849.34 → 7853.66] those types of deadlines with things like independent game launches because you set the
[7853.66 → 7858.22] date but in this situation like there's a lot of moving pieces you're screwing a lot of different
[7858.22 → 7864.06] people over if you move your date back so yep or forward or wherever like changing anything really
[7864.06 → 7870.46] disrupts the plans and distributors and in such a globalized world right there 's's always a
[7870.46 → 7874.22] time zone where it's highly problematic for someone to be having to deal with this right now
[7874.22 → 7883.58] hey DLL now that you have some new cats when can we expect the next Linus cat tips video I uploaded a
[7883.58 → 7887.82] short for some reason I was feeling just inspired too and one of them like grabbed my feet from under
[7887.82 → 7890.78] the bed and I was like that'd be funny, and then they didn't really do it the same way when I turned
[7890.78 → 7894.22] on the camera and then I was like ah this wasn't really worth it so I didn't bother doing anymore
[7896.78 → 7901.66] that's where I'm out on that fair enough yeah hey DLL have you heard about the iPhone users having
[7901.66 → 7906.86] all their notes deleted after accepting iCloud's new terms of service I had six months of important
[7906.86 → 7915.42] notes not backed up due to my five gigs of iCloud being full wow I have not heard uh but hey it just
[7915.42 → 7923.26] works uh dude I feel like I'm going to make some enemies with my iOS 18 slash iPhone 16 I know you will
[7923.26 → 7931.74] video i um i am certain i because man i uh like there's one point where I'm just like
[7932.38 → 7938.78] I think the next time someone tells me it's magic it just works whatever i I don't know if I'll be
[7938.78 → 7944.38] able to help it I might just laugh in their face like i it's just it's such a's such a like
[7944.38 → 7950.86] galactically stupid thing to say at this point and I'm not saying that android is perfect and just
[7950.86 → 7954.86] works and I'm not saying windows is perfect and just works I'm saying their all trash
[7954.86 → 7962.94] they're all human they're all full of bugs and problems like let's just let's just not pretend
[7962.94 → 7971.18] that's that's it let's not pretend that because someone says it so that it must be thusly like
[7971.18 → 7973.02] that's not how things work if something
[7973.02 → 7981.18] like uh and I think the thing that I was going off on was uh the way to sign in to your google
[7981.18 → 7987.18] account on an iPhone um which I know how to do and we've talked about and I figured out
[7988.30 → 7997.90] but it is just to say that that's intuitive good design is just so utterly incorrect um
[7997.90 → 8003.58] um but i just I don't really we're clearly not living on the same planet speaking the same
[8003.58 → 8009.18] language so I don't even know how to talk to you like if you think that going into the Apple mail app
[8010.38 → 8018.06] in order to sign in to your Google account system-wide is intuitive or good design it's its just not it just
[8019.10 → 8025.58] isn't um, and it's funny because I was reflecting on it some more, and you know how the settings app is
[8025.58 → 8030.54] where it used to be before that if I recall correctly it actually used to be in the initial
[8030.54 → 8037.42] setup wizard am i remembering incorrectly because i I seem to recall that it used to be
[8037.42 → 8041.66] I think that was the case on android oh it's definitely the case on, and it's still the case on android
[8041.66 → 8048.94] but I recall seeing that uh like google Microsoft that that interface right when you are
[8048.94 → 8059.42] setting up the phone initially um yeah no it was yeah it's its it's amazing yeah people are saying
[8059.42 → 8067.42] yes yeah malar the first says wait do they not just have an account section in settings no they do not
[8069.10 → 8075.02] it is not there and the people that are like well you're just used to android no apple used to have it
[8075.02 → 8081.02] you could be used to literally any other phone and that's where it should be yes, yes they do not
[8081.02 → 8087.18] have it and yes that is on purpose you guys so whenever people say to me yeah apple's just like
[8087.18 → 8097.74] it's more intuitive they're just wrong apple's design can be wrong and there are a lot of things they did
[8097.74 → 8102.78] really well intuitive is subjective though isn't it because it could be intuitive to a different person who
[8102.78 → 8107.58] has different expectations and different approaches, but you can measure these things so one of the ways
[8107.58 → 8114.30] that I measured this one was I checked the number of ratings on the app store for the first party Gmail
[8114.30 → 8120.54] app and the first party google calendar app because if you'll recall what I wanted to do was I wanted to
[8120.54 → 8127.26] use my Gmail app and I wanted to use apple's calendar app because I wanted to try it I don't I don't actually
[8127.26 → 8132.62] have any attachment to apple's calendar app but I wanted to try it out but what I'm not interested in using is
[8132.62 → 8138.70] Apple's mail app I don't like it I've never liked it um I prefer to just use the Gmail app and what i
[8138.70 → 8147.66] found was that the Google Gmail app had 2.2 million ratings on the app store the Google calendar
[8147.66 → 8155.50] app had like a hundred thousand so what I can tell you objectively is that my setup where I wanted to roll
[8155.50 → 8163.26] the Gmail app and apple's own calendar app is clearly a thing that people are doing 20 times the
[8163.26 → 8169.90] download rate of the Gmail app versus the Google calendar app so the number of people replacing
[8169.90 → 8175.58] their email client on the iPhone compared to the number of people replacing their calendar client
[8175.58 → 8180.46] with Google's first party alternatives or third party alternatives rather yeah, but email is something
[8180.46 → 8185.90] that's like more important it's its it's less replaceable than calendar because other people
[8185.90 → 8193.26] have your contact no, no all I'm saying is it wasn't intuitive for me necessarily and neither would
[8193.26 → 8199.50] it necessarily is for a lot of people to open up Apple's mail app and use that because clearly lots of
[8199.50 → 8207.66] people don't use it they use the Google one and clearly not all of those people also replaced the Google
[8207.66 → 8214.54] calendar app they want to do exactly what I wanted to do use the Gmail app and the apple calendar app
[8214.54 → 8222.70] right 20 times as many ratings so and you, and you can't, you can't do what you're saying oh you can
[8222.70 → 8226.86] but if you sign in to the Gmail app it doesn't sign you in system-wide
[8229.10 → 8236.70] in order to sign your Google account in on an iPhone you have to launch Apple's mail app and sign into your
[8236.70 → 8243.98] Gmail there okay's nowhere else to do it what is the system what other things are handyman
[8243.98 → 8250.22] saying this isn't true um what other things are you trying to have logged in I guess well I want
[8250.22 → 8255.50] my I want my contacts to sync you want your oh I want my calendar to sync okay I want my Google account
[8255.50 → 8265.90] signed things like your phone yeah you can do it in the settings no you can't hear it is in my pocket
[8265.90 → 8269.50] there's a bunch of different people saying it right now I think this is going to be the biggest
[8269.50 → 8273.66] problem with the video you're almost going to have like an unlisted companion video
[8274.22 → 8279.74] that goes over like it's just like actually it really is this stupid here 's's the here's the
[8279.74 → 8293.42] defence minus cam settings here we go okay all right so here is yep there we go just making sure there's
[8293.42 → 8303.58] nothing particularly okay here we go here is settings accounts no third-party accounts just
[8303.58 → 8312.94] iCloud just sign in with apple nothing else here's the rest of the settings Apple account iCloud
[8312.94 → 8317.74] mail that's the same thing isn't if there is, but it's not you can't sign in to Gmail there
[8317.74 → 8325.66] settings Apple account iCloud mail but I don't use iCloud settings apps calendar accounts settings
[8327.26 → 8334.94] hold on hold on settings apps where's that okay calendar
[8336.22 → 8338.86] uh right below calculator yeah
[8338.86 → 8344.14] are you kidding me there's a Google button
[8350.22 → 8356.14] should we like go hold on a second hold on a second is your argument that that's intuitive
[8358.86 → 8364.30] to add an account to that app if you're an iOS user, and it's worked that way for 10 years like
[8364.30 → 8370.06] yeah, but it didn't use to how did it use to I don't I never you I've never once mainlined an iPhone
[8370.06 → 8377.66] there used to be in settings and accounts parent menu a handyman I don't think he's saying that
[8378.30 → 8382.62] you didn't show him two weeks ago he's saying that that doesn't seem intuitive I'm saying it's not
[8382.62 → 8383.26] intuitive
[8383.26 → 8394.62] so we will have to do can you not get there in the app or something or like no you can't that you
[8394.62 → 8401.66] definitely cannot so that feels unintuitive to me, you can't do it in there you can get there in the mail
[8401.66 → 8411.98] app not in the calendar app but if I'm an iOS user am I used to going to that settings page to do things
[8411.98 → 8416.22] like that so here's what happens here's what happens when you open mail, and you aren't signed in
[8418.94 → 8422.06] you are prompted to sign in so that thing that we got on the other page yes
[8422.70 → 8428.22] here's what happens if you open up the first party calendar app, and you are not signed in
[8430.54 → 8434.94] yeah because I'm assuming it just uses like a local account which again this is what I was kind of
[8434.94 → 8439.26] trying to point out earlier is like add calendar no nothing there
[8439.26 → 8446.54] add nope that's an event but people are a little bit more uh
[8448.14 → 8453.50] is temporal the right word like calendars are kind of whatever compared to an email account
[8453.50 → 8458.62] sure but so hold on but the part you're missing is I'm signing in to my email
[8459.42 → 8464.70] but I'm using the Gmail app I don't want to use Apple's mail app yeah but like I'm not interested in
[8464.70 → 8468.38] I don't necessarily if I sign in to my Microsoft account on my phone I don't necessarily want to
[8468.38 → 8473.10] import my Microsoft calendar into my calendars app no, but you can be prompted what you do or don't want
[8473.10 → 8479.02] to sync when you add an account agree but does it work that way like what is there a default calendar
[8479.02 → 8486.62] app on oh it would be the Google calendar on android android android yeah I don't know that it asks you
[8486.62 → 8493.42] if you want your Microsoft calendar stuff in here add another account can I add a non Microsoft account
[8493.42 → 8494.70] this way checking info
[8498.78 → 8504.46] Luke's doing stuff he's cooking it's a Google it immediately assumes a Google account um
[8505.34 → 8511.10] manage accounts on this device so that should bring you to where you can sign in to any kind
[8511.10 → 8516.38] of account you want settings page, but it does it's not actually it's not calendar specific
[8517.58 → 8521.98] it's just like everything no, but you would go in your calendar app, and you would tell it which calendars
[8521.98 → 8530.22] you want to sync I'm in my calendar app though and add another account is just google accounts
[8531.66 → 8537.10] and then I have manage accounts which just brings me to all general sorry what's the question though
[8537.10 → 8542.22] it's it there's no there's no prompt to add the Microsoft account you're saying you're saying it
[8542.22 → 8545.66] would be more intuitive there's a prompt I'm saying I don't think there's a prompt on android
[8546.22 → 8552.86] if there's a prompt to add what though the Microsoft account oh the Microsoft account no, no I would say
[8552.86 → 8558.94] an apple calendar thing but I don't have one of those so I can't no, no I expected account management
[8558.94 → 8568.06] the place I expected to find account management was under my name here at the top sure oh whoops
[8568.06 → 8575.02] wow dang it I'm going to figure this out camel name there we go the place I would expect to find it
[8575.02 → 8580.06] is under my name here at the top where my Apple account and my iCloud is i would expect to
[8580.06 → 8586.14] maybe find all of my accounts there uh I might expect it to find I might expect to find it under accounts
[8586.14 → 8592.38] like under you know general accessibility uh you know Siri you know all my accounts here
[8592.38 → 8598.94] um those are places where I would expect to find system-wide accounts that I log into that
[8599.90 → 8608.78] work across multiple apps what I wouldn't expect is for the mail the default mail and the default
[8608.78 → 8615.82] calendar app to operate completely different ways in terms of adding a new account so when i click on
[8615.82 → 8623.26] mail it immediately prompts me hey do you want to sign in to one of these types of accounts, and we've
[8623.26 → 8630.22] got important thing important account types like AOL for example in there uh when I go into the calendar
[8630.22 → 8635.50] one it prompts me for nothing so the only real point that I have with the calendar versus mail one is that
[8635.50 → 8642.30] they behave completely different ways yeah after I've already like gone into my settings menu and what
[8642.30 → 8647.98] would be the most intuitive settings place for me different ways is the unintuitive portion after
[8647.98 → 8652.86] I've already gone into the settings and gone okay where the devil do I sign in to my bloody Google account
[8655.50 → 8662.86] yeah I'm just saying if it's not prompting you for any other accounts on android either
[8662.86 → 8665.66] um
[8665.66 → 8666.06] um
[8666.06 → 8672.06] Ry saw says it was much better in iOS 17 they created the new apps menu at the bottom of settings in iOS 18
[8672.46 → 8677.58] if I recall correctly the whole um finding settings
[8678.86 → 8686.86] under apps has been a thing for a really long time uh like I man I forget there was something years ago
[8686.86 → 8694.54] that I was trying to figure out how the heck to do, and it turns out that it was like oh you know
[8694.54 → 8698.14] well was it that was it something was I trying to change something on the camera or something
[8698.70 → 8703.82] I forget what it was but I had to dig into apps in order to change something that that seemed like it
[8703.82 → 8712.06] would be sort of fundamental to the system I know sorry so the goofy like hiding settings in under
[8712.06 → 8719.02] apps thing um even though they are system-wide and not necessarily specific to that particular app
[8719.02 → 8724.94] that's not new uh but I don't know to your point I haven't used iOS 17 so I don't know I don't think
[8724.94 → 8729.42] they're having moved between I think you just think that they should be which is fine well if they
[8729.42 → 8733.74] affect more than one app yeah, but that doesn't mean they're system-wide it means they affect that
[8733.74 → 8739.34] means they aren't that app that setting is are you saying one setting is changing things system-wide no
[8739.34 → 8743.82] I'm saying when you log into a Google account yeah but I don't think you're logging into a system-wide
[8743.82 → 8749.66] account on iPhone okay well sorry we're using the term system-wide very differently what I'm saying is
[8749.66 → 8754.86] that you are logged into an account that is inherently logged in the second you open up another supported
[8754.86 → 8760.86] app that uses that same login if I log into my mail account immediately my calendars will sync so it's
[8760.86 → 8766.54] my contacts will say indicated and all that okay, okay okay so that's that's what doesn't make sense to
[8766.54 → 8774.94] me why I have to open Apple's mail account to do that or to your guy's point I have to go dig into
[8775.90 → 8783.02] apps find something that happens to be googled will chrome work no chrome doesn't work I can't log into
[8783.02 → 8793.10] my Google account in chrome brilliant um I'll have to find a different one docs doesn't work docs
[8793.10 → 8803.10] doesn't have the login drive maybe drive uh the login for what though for my Google account i I'm not
[8803.10 → 8810.86] logged into it but like so but if I go to mail if I go to hold on and I don't know that that
[8810.86 → 8817.82] mail now I can log in my Google account, and it will work with those other things can you view
[8817.82 → 8825.34] outlook through the Gmail app I don't use outlook so I don't know yeah like I don't know if maybe you
[8825.34 → 8830.30] can I don't know if you can add third-party apps to the Gmail account so I think the fact that
[8830.30 → 8836.30] there is clunky what apparently you can really you can add outlook to the Gmail account oh, oh wait
[8836.30 → 8841.18] oh okay yeah yeah okay I don't have it set up that way yeah yeah no the gmail app is
[8841.18 → 8846.38] just a mail client multifunction mail yep yeah 100 because like what I'm looking at right now is yeah
[8846.38 → 8852.06] if and I don't want to show you guys sorry if I go add an account yes this will eventually load and
[8852.06 → 8860.06] it's its only Google accounts yeah so okay fine if I go manage accounts on this device yep it brings me
[8860.06 → 8865.50] to password pass keys and autofill, and it doesn't bring up things that could sync that's not if I use
[8865.50 → 8871.74] that phone then I would say that that's trash and that's not intuitive yeah okay, so my point is not
[8871.74 → 8881.50] that android is better yeah my point is that that is terrible and is not intuitive if I wanted to log
[8881.50 → 8890.14] in an account if I had never touched an android phone or an iPhone before and I wanted to and I wanted to
[8890.14 → 8895.50] get get get my like google calendar and that was like the first thing that I wanted to do
[8897.90 → 8903.42] where do I go from here how would I how would I do it from here there is literally no way to be
[8903.42 → 8909.66] prompted to sign in to some other type of account literally no way I'm not going to lie I'm immediately
[8909.66 → 8916.06] lost because i I feel so lost the second I touch an iPhone that's not an iPhone problem that's a that's
[8916.06 → 8922.70] a mini problem but um yeah I would personally like there to be a setting in the app somewhere i
[8922.70 → 8928.22] generally like it when I can fully operate things from within the app I don't like it when I have to go
[8928.22 → 8935.98] to external settings on anything whether that's a desktop device um any form of phone whatever it
[8935.98 → 8941.26] doesn't matter so the just fundamentally don't understand how this is working it's not a system
[8941.26 → 8949.18] wide account what you're saying is false I believe uh if I want my calendar to sync I have to sign in
[8949.18 → 8963.10] to the mail app really yes now I was shown that other way I can also go into settings right so I can
[8963.10 → 8972.54] also go into settings apps calendar and I can add a calendar account here
[8977.10 → 8981.34] so it's not going through the mail app but it's still it's still a lot of clicks clunky that's
[8981.34 → 8986.22] what you're saying and it was a very different interface compared to when I went to the mail app
[8986.22 → 8991.58] and I was immediately prompted to sign in to my Gmail so if you open mail first the way that you're being
[8991.58 → 8995.74] trained to interact with the phone is not the same as when you open the calendar app correct yeah
[8997.26 → 9002.14] settings apps calendar accounts make sense to me though it does make sense to me too but his point
[9002.14 → 9007.34] is that when you open the mail app another first party app that is highly related to calendar I would
[9007.34 → 9012.94] say um it doesn't work the same way yeah so he just doesn't guess you didn't see that he clicked on
[9012.94 → 9017.02] the mail app he's not currently signed in to anything so it immediately prompts him to log into stuff
[9017.02 → 9021.42] when he clicks on the calendar app there is no prompt now I have an iCloud account because
[9021.42 → 9026.54] you have to sign in to an iCloud account in order to like sign into the phone in order to set up
[9026.54 → 9031.10] the phone as far as I know can you set it up without an Apple account maybe you can, I've never tried
[9031.66 → 9037.58] um so that's the calendars that it's pulling its pulling like ancient apple calendars open
[9037.58 → 9042.70] open calendar I saw this button earlier but I didn't really think about it open calendar click on
[9042.70 → 9051.42] find it go away click on calendars at the bottom calendars at the bottom there we go and then i
[9051.42 → 9059.34] think I saw there's like uh add calendar yeah yep uh nope at holiday calendar at subscription
[9059.34 → 9063.10] calendar and family calendar what's just add calendar what's add calendar again
[9066.86 → 9069.66] so is it fixed on iCloud can you click the thing that says iCloud
[9069.66 → 9074.46] yeah I don't know guys
[9077.90 → 9078.78] I don't know what to tell you
[9083.34 → 9088.46] a calendar can be local to your vice only yeah I pointed that out earlier yeah um mail is not just
[9088.46 → 9095.74] local yeah yeah yeah um I don't know i I get why I understand what Linus is saying I also get why it
[9095.74 → 9102.22] might not work that way um I would like that add a calendar thing that we just did it is literally
[9102.22 → 9106.78] shows an account line that's like it's it says account and then there's a grayed out text on the
[9106.78 → 9114.06] side that says iCloud it was like if that just was able to be whatever you wanted then or it opened a
[9114.06 → 9120.86] prompt to log into another account yeah sure whatever yeah that's what I would try to do if I wanted to log
[9120.86 → 9126.70] into my calendar app I would go to my calendar app and this is exactly what I tried to do
[9127.26 → 9132.70] I went into my calendar app stop it I went into my calendar app I went to calendars I went to add
[9132.70 → 9137.50] calendar pretty intuitive I went to add calendar intuitive and I was like and now there's yeah
[9138.06 → 9142.06] which it feels broken almost there 's's a line that says account and then on the right
[9142.06 → 9146.38] it's grayed out and says calender and he can't interact with it at all what's up with that that seems
[9146.38 → 9154.30] weird is something wrong no set up google in settings mail then turn on everything then in
[9154.30 → 9158.94] calendar tap on the word calendar at the bottom and add it there which is exactly what I've been trying
[9158.94 → 9165.98] to say so that makes it a global account if you do it that way well not global account but it is makes
[9165.98 → 9173.98] it so that you're like you can access your Google crap will sink yeah see that's wacky I'm sorry, but that is
[9173.98 → 9183.82] you're right I missed something it actually doesn't change my point at all that these two systems behave
[9183.82 → 9187.42] very such a bloodbath very differently from each other
[9190.78 → 9197.66] you should do like oh man it might be brutal it might suck yeah I think it'd be kind of fun if you did a
[9197.66 → 9206.30] stream like whatever the duration of the video is after the video launches yeah you start a live stream
[9207.58 → 9211.42] and then just basically do this that'd be kind of fun actually
[9214.14 → 9220.78] real time the um actually comments you're pissed about apple fight me live brush like I don't know
[9220.78 → 9225.10] it'd be kind of interesting thank you mikado everyone's saying he's wrong is nitpicking the
[9225.10 → 9230.14] minutiae and missing the entire actual point missing the forest for the trees as it were you
[9230.14 → 9235.98] guys like what do you want me to say you guys are right that I didn't think to go digging into
[9236.78 → 9242.38] a sub menu of a sub menu of a sub menu instead of just opening the app and signing in the way that
[9242.38 → 9249.66] I did in the other one I would hope that's what that's the problem skill issue to sign in to mail i just
[9249.66 → 9257.34] open the mail app and I sign in to mail which will also allow me to sync my contacts and my calendars
[9257.34 → 9262.70] and my Google stuff that I need for work if I want to sign in to calendar
[9264.46 → 9272.86] I open calendar, and it's a complete dead end uh handyman saying because on iPhone all settings
[9272.86 → 9277.02] are expected to be under settings apps that's just apple's approach may not like it, but it's
[9277.02 → 9281.98] their way of doing it yeah there are lots of settings that are not what happens when they're not matter
[9281.98 → 9286.54] Tim said does it matter that apple's guide on this explains it well and I found it quick
[9286.54 → 9291.02] I think good documentation matters, and then he linked it I don't think you should need a guide for
[9291.02 → 9296.62] logging into your I think needing a guide inherently means it's not intuitive if we're using the word
[9296.62 → 9303.66] intuitive for what it's supposed to mean um yeah, so the overly defensive line is here but
[9303.66 → 9311.26] um the intuitive using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning so
[9312.38 → 9315.34] needing to look up a guide just automatically yeah
[9321.18 → 9327.26] man anything to do with iOS man is uh it's I don't know it's a spicy
[9327.26 → 9337.74] it's just a's a hilarious thing because i um I say look i uh I think hot dogs are unintuitive
[9338.46 → 9346.86] and people go hamburgers are so much less unintuitive linus loves hamburgers the ingredients slide
[9346.86 → 9354.70] around I think they're both unintuitive I think there are problems with both and I think to I think to i
[9354.70 → 9362.94] think to make this argument that this is that this is good design is just um like I don't really I don't
[9362.94 → 9364.78] really know what to tell you
[9367.42 → 9373.26] if I can, and you say look it's the apple way that the settings for it are in they are in the apps part
[9373.26 → 9380.62] of the settings menu okay so is the account that you're logged into a setting yes or no
[9380.62 → 9386.94] I think I would generally think sure so then for the mail app it should be in the settings of the
[9386.94 → 9394.22] mail app it should not prompt me when I open it then it might even be useful in my opinion to make it
[9394.22 → 9403.42] so that uh I think some apps do work that way maybe not in the Apple ecosystem but if it was like we see
[9403.42 → 9409.10] you're not signed in press this button to go to the settings, and it like opens the settings app and
[9409.10 → 9413.74] like makes a little bit of a display of like sure, but it doesn't do that yeah and that's the problem
[9413.74 → 9418.30] Avon fox says it's not that it's that you say it's trash because it's not for how your brain works is
[9418.30 → 9427.74] insulting for people to people for whom it is um when something when UI or UX is inconsistent
[9428.70 → 9434.54] that's bad that's measurably that's measurably bad that's not that's not the goal and
[9434.54 → 9444.54] because we're used to something does not mean that it's good and when I say something's bad it's not
[9444.54 → 9450.38] personal the fact that you're used to it, or you like if it's not personal it's literally my job to
[9450.38 → 9457.18] point out things that are unintuitive or that aren't good about technology something that I will never
[9457.18 → 9462.78] understand though yeah is and this is again coming from android brain because it's the only thing I've used
[9462.78 → 9471.74] um my mom always struggled with android she would find ways to email me text messages uh wow like that's
[9471.74 → 9476.86] kind of impressive there's weird like no, but she could not send me a normal text message I would just
[9476.86 → 9483.18] receive emails that were text messages and like I don't I've never actually even done that yeah like
[9483.18 → 9489.42] it's its weird it's not a normal email it's not you know she sent an email with text in it no it's
[9489.42 → 9495.74] a text message in an email right like as an attachment yeah it's like it was very odd it was years ago but
[9495.74 → 9502.14] it was very weird, and she had lots of other crazy weird problems with her android phone and then uh she
[9502.14 → 9509.10] was working in the movie industry for a while yeah, and they had like standardized on some uh iOS stuff i
[9509.10 → 9513.98] don't remember what it was yeah um so she needed an iPhone she got an iPhone instantly perfect
[9515.74 → 9521.02] I remember power user no issues I remember you telling me about this because to her the whole like
[9521.02 → 9527.66] like like like uh throwing away an app was just like super intuitive instant yeah no thoughts
[9528.46 → 9532.30] immediately worked like the most intuitive thing you could ever imagine yeah and then I try to go do
[9532.30 → 9539.58] something on her phone I'm like yeah I set up my aunt with an iPhone years ago because basically i
[9539.58 → 9545.26] didn't want to coach her on how to use her phone yeah, and it's been very painless it works so like i
[9546.38 → 9553.50] they got something going on um, um, so people are pointing out things that are just um
[9554.62 → 9561.50] like i I don't really oh man I don't really I don't really know what to say to you so zinthoxin
[9561.50 → 9567.34] says mail prompts you because it has nothing to load if you aren't signed in but okay please my
[9567.34 → 9574.86] problem was never that mail prompted me to sign in you liked that part of anything that's good yeah
[9575.50 → 9583.26] my problem was that when I did the same behaviour the same user behaviour and I opened my calendar
[9583.26 → 9593.02] it did not prompt me to log in and had absolutely no way for me to log in and no breadcrumb trail for
[9593.02 → 9603.82] me to follow to log in nothing if we agree that the account you're logged into is a setting and if we
[9603.82 → 9612.14] agree that apple puts settings under settings apps and the name of the app then we agree that the mail
[9612.70 → 9620.46] account that we log in should be there only there with no way to link to it from the app itself
[9621.42 → 9629.42] but that is not the case therefore the mail app follows a different set of rules from the calendar app
[9629.42 → 9638.06] guys are we there yet did we get there index or nix I don't know yeah I think it's hubris to not
[9638.06 → 9642.78] ever look for help in the modern era and has good docs, and he's talking about the fact that there's a
[9642.78 → 9648.70] good doc on how to do this one of the problems that you guys are some of you guys are really struggling
[9648.70 → 9656.46] with is the word intuitive if he has to look up a help doc for something it is not intuitive to him
[9656.46 → 9661.82] flat out there's no there's no other interpretation of that if he has to look up a help doc for
[9661.82 → 9664.86] something it is not intuitive also I did figure it out
[9667.18 → 9670.78] I figured out to log into the mail app that's not the problem
[9673.10 → 9673.66] oh boy
[9675.66 → 9680.94] cape says when will you have a video criticizing android these had many tons
[9680.94 → 9690.70] it's its amazing for years for many years it's amazing the selective perception
[9691.26 → 9699.58] that people have you're insulting my tribe this entire video was dunking on the deplorable state
[9699.58 → 9704.70] of AOSP yeah that might not have been the best video example to bring up it was two months ago
[9705.42 → 9711.66] i i I understand that not everyone agrees with the premise of the video yeah but the premise of the
[9711.66 → 9716.38] video was what the premise of the video was you guys aren't wrong that is stock android it is stock
[9716.38 → 9719.98] android whether you like it or not I just don't know how applicable it is because it doesn't apply to
[9719.98 → 9724.70] anybody but that was our point yeah our point was that stock android's kind of dead, and we discussed
[9724.70 → 9733.26] some of the reasons that it's kind of dead for users yeah yes um uh let's see let's see uh
[9733.26 → 9738.86] I'm trying to remember because I'm pretty sure we did um
[9741.10 → 9748.22] I'm pretty sure we've done rant style videos on both iOS and android or have we only done you know
[9748.22 → 9755.02] what no we haven't we did um I really wonder if you should somehow I don't know how you would do this
[9755.02 → 9760.70] is the video already shot uh partially I wonder if you should somehow get like a subset
[9760.70 → 9767.02] of you know those videos that are trending right now where these iPhones are just better they put
[9767.02 → 9772.22] yeah six years ago there you go uh they have like somebody in a chair with a table and another chair
[9772.22 → 9776.14] across from it in the middle of a room and then a circle of people around it, and it's like android is
[9776.14 → 9780.54] just better all those people in the circle versus one person yeah yeah that's already on the calendar
[9780.54 → 9787.58] oh okay I don't know so i I feel like you should like basically get a subset of like apple fans I can
[9787.58 → 9793.50] think of one t3 the ooh we could definitely find some and then give them your talking points for the
[9793.50 → 9800.86] video and then fight their talking points like in the video because i I've I've I don't know honestly
[9800.86 → 9806.70] that probably won't even help anything no it won't help it won't help anything Luke I mean the fact that
[9806.70 → 9813.66] people don't think I criticize android is all that you really need to know about the sort of selection
[9813.66 → 9826.70] bias of um the perception of my takes on these things I have been hyper critical of windows android
[9826.70 → 9833.66] iOS macOS basically like I said my entire job is looking at things and going this is what could be
[9833.66 → 9842.78] better about them, I also highlight things I really like i just I'm just trying to take because i
[9842.78 → 9846.86] know this obviously this video is going to be a bloodbath so I'm just trying to figure out like how
[9846.86 → 9854.14] do we how do we how do we pull all the iron out of it and make a sword um how do we like how do we do
[9854.14 → 9859.58] something cool with that basically so like there's the stream that starts the total duration of
[9859.58 → 9867.34] the video after the video goes live um there's this like I don't know picking like five apple
[9867.34 → 9873.58] creators and then having them fight you on it or something um change my mind style I don't know
[9874.14 → 9878.30] I think that'd be kind of I think that'd be kind of fun yeah because especially like it could even be
[9878.30 → 9883.42] genuinely helpful because as long as people come in with like an understanding that you might end up
[9883.42 → 9889.98] agreeing to disagree then it's probably just going to be like a good conversation I don't know
[9892.22 → 9896.62] separate what is personal opinion in fact the whole conversation we're having right now is that
[9896.62 → 9901.10] that seems to be a very difficult thing like i I'm not going against even fox here to be clear but that
[9901.10 → 9905.66] seems to be a very difficult thing with a lot of topics and this is one of them this is sure this
[9905.66 → 9910.54] is definitely one which is just baffling to me because so weird at the end of the day if you
[9910.54 → 9916.94] ripped my android phone out of my hands I'd use an iPhone yeah like i um there would be things that
[9916.94 → 9921.98] bother me about it just like there are things that bother me about my android phone um tacky the penguin
[9921.98 → 9926.22] says you're really straining for a gnat which is not an expression I've heard before but I think i kind
[9926.22 → 9931.18] of like it, you're straining for a gnat if your biggest issue with iOS is how you sign in to calendars
[9931.18 → 9934.30] it isn't it's just not intuitive
[9934.30 → 9941.18] who said it was and what i and what I said was anyone who tells me that is intuitive
[9941.90 → 9947.90] I'm sorry but i i I have to take exception and then I laid out why would you take the biggest
[9947.90 → 9953.98] exception with this issue I laid out the only exception you have in very clear like the
[9953.98 → 9963.10] like in very clear mathematical terms why it's not intuitive and how the one app behaves differently
[9963.10 → 9969.34] from the other app and if we accept this rule that the account we're signed in to is a setting
[9969.34 → 9973.42] and settings can only be here and are not linked to from the app then the fact that one behaves one
[9973.42 → 9981.66] way and one behaves the other way is not compatible with each other and that is not intuitive and pretty
[9981.66 → 9989.66] easy to solve as well actually extremely easy to solve yeah it is it is so easy to solve and
[9989.66 → 9999.66] is so intuitive to solve in fact some people who opposed my criticism of apple in the chat today
[9999.66 → 10007.42] we're saying it's so simple you just click add calendar, but it wasn't there yeah why wasn't it there
[10008.06 → 10014.22] I don't know it seems like something's wrong because like why would that line even be there if you
[10014.22 → 10020.38] can't do anything with it and that's where like my brain feels like it's broken and maybe this is
[10020.38 → 10026.70] android brain I don't know because i i I expected I would be able to click on that, and it would list
[10026.70 → 10031.58] the various system-wide accounts that I have and there would be an account add account option and
[10031.58 → 10035.18] maybe it brings me out to some other menu and I have to add a system-wide account there's 10 trillion
[10035.18 → 10039.90] authentication steps, and it puts its fingers into everything in my phone and whatever else but like
[10039.90 → 10047.58] that's the flow that I would expect I would not expect a line that is completely not intractable
[10047.58 → 10055.58] on a page of inputs that's not something I would expect like ever to be honest apple was forced to
[10055.58 → 10065.82] make setting up mail as easy as Apple mail great okay so you're saying then that the fact that they work
[10065.82 → 10072.86] differently is because apple put user hostile design that's not the argument you wanted in their
[10072.86 → 10077.90] calendar app and left it there because they were never forced to change it
[10084.38 → 10084.78] yikes
[10090.86 → 10092.14] why are they like this
[10095.82 → 10098.54] and now they want to change the subject
[10101.02 → 10106.78] well you got to go to settings and then there's the change subject app settings which are only in
[10106.78 → 10111.74] settings yeah, but it's in the settings of the subject app not in the global settings
[10112.54 → 10117.74] and it's under a hamburger menu I got another merch message for you here we're going to be here all night
[10117.74 → 10125.50] and Luke's birds are going to get sad why no sign do you want to move on we can keep talking about this
[10125.50 → 10130.30] if you want yeah no, no no all right cool line us I need to paint my house it's only uh
[10130.30 → 10137.02] 1 150 square feet people tell me rolling looks worse than spraying is it worth buying a sprayer just
[10137.02 → 10143.66] for one-time use absolutely rolling be okay get good at rolling uh it's not that hard um basically what
[10143.66 → 10151.66] it just comes down to is make sure you apply enough material and then kind of spread it out and level it
[10151.66 → 10158.94] out without um pressing too hard and then make sure that you've got a light on nearby because while
[10158.94 → 10164.06] it's wet it's really it kind of has a sheen, and it's really easy to see any spots where you've got too
[10164.06 → 10170.38] much paint built up, and it'll drip so make sure that you go right away um and kind of level those
[10170.38 → 10176.70] out without a ton of paint on the roller before moving on to the next area um cut in the edges
[10176.70 → 10181.10] first even though it's like tedious, and it feels like you're not making any progress even though
[10181.10 → 10185.82] you're doing the vast majority of the work you're covering the minority of the wall and then uh
[10187.10 → 10191.26] and then do your uh and then do your rolling it makes the yeah the remaining a lot easier yeah
[10191.90 → 10197.74] use a drop sheet no matter how careful you think you can be use a drop sheet because as you roll the
[10197.74 → 10203.42] roller it turns obviously and when you've got paint on it'll flick out little bits of paint
[10203.42 → 10207.66] so as long as you have a drop sheet down there it'll grab everything why would you say using a
[10207.66 → 10216.30] spray is unintuitive i I'll not yeah sure I'll tell you paint sprayer operation is often not very
[10216.30 → 10224.06] intuitive sure I'm just no I'm good i i will die on that hill the apple one honestly doesn't
[10224.06 → 10229.34] matter to me that much but I will die on the paint sprayer hill del main was like I just tagged me
[10229.34 → 10242.78] and said I hate you fair enough oh man okay uh this is a hard end of the show been seeing the hoodie
[10242.78 → 10247.50] all week on tech and game linked and couldn't wait for it to drop the wife and I are suckers for cozy
[10247.50 → 10255.42] clothing Linus what's the next step in foldable that makes it mainstream hi man I don't know for
[10255.42 → 10261.90] apple to make one and I don't think they will uh it's been rumoured for a long time they're clearly
[10261.90 → 10268.22] looking at the technology they'd be crazy not to be looking at it at the very least but they obviously
[10268.22 → 10274.38] have a lot of work to do on making their sign-in process consistent from app to app so they still
[10274.38 → 10278.78] haven't figured out how to make the camera bump they do only have one developer so we got to give
[10278.78 → 10283.82] them time let them cook yeah currently they're working on the calendar login um we'll have to
[10283.82 → 10289.42] come back to foldable compatibility yeah they got t9 dialling nailed though nice yeah good job
[10290.22 → 10296.86] yeah they did it deserves a promotion then they'll have zero devs i actually love it I love
[10296.86 → 10305.02] t9 dialling it's so great the um the way that apple handles all your different um phone call
[10305.82 → 10312.54] accounts so to speak your different voice uh communication methods is amazing here call me
[10312.54 → 10319.26] call me on the phone sorry I'm just very tempted to dojo said a good one which was uh
[10319.26 → 10322.86] uh why are you saying that flat screens are so unintuitive
[10327.34 → 10329.34] okay I'm calling okay, okay
[10333.42 → 10339.98] okay so check this out uh yeah there's no okay so it comes up like this right and then if I want
[10339.98 → 10343.10] to answer then i just you know hit my button or whatever okay call me on Teams now
[10343.10 → 10347.34] be here for a half hour no, no it's cool
[10351.90 → 10362.06] I hate teams so much you really do okay, so this is cool watch this how cool is that the interface is
[10362.06 → 10367.74] really nice identical that's genuinely very nice, and the best part is if I go into my call log
[10367.74 → 10378.46] just both that's really nice yeah that's intuitive that's very intuitive objectively that's intuitive
[10378.46 → 10384.22] genuinely very cool i actually yeah I am envious of that it's especially nice on like for CarPlay
[10384.86 → 10391.10] because I don't have to think about what slightly different interface might come up like when I get
[10391.10 → 10397.50] a WhatsApp call in the car on android it sucks it like brings up a little thing swipe things and
[10397.50 → 10403.90] whatever yeah it's annoying yeah so it's very, very intuitive okay, so apple people are you okay now
[10404.78 → 10409.98] are you good that is genuinely like as someone who doesn't use iPhones that is sick and I wish I had that
[10409.98 → 10415.82] are you good are you okay are we over the calendar thing probably not and how the settings are
[10415.82 → 10421.02] not in the same place and that's objectively actually kind of stupid but this isn't this is not
[10421.02 → 10426.14] stupid this is perfect something they are in this they're something that's not no they're
[10426.14 → 10430.22] not in the same place they are, but they're also sometimes in a different place but not
[10430.86 → 10435.50] they're one time in a different place yeah yeah yeah which is except when they aren't in that
[10435.50 → 10441.74] different place yeah which is not intuitive yeah but this you know what makes something intuitive
[10441.74 → 10448.78] when someone who's never seen it before is like whoa that's really intuitive yeah that was pretty
[10448.78 → 10455.90] intuitive wasn't it yeah and oh man not having to like bananas sometimes swipe left and sometimes
[10455.90 → 10462.78] swipe out of a circle and sometimes press a circle on android the call receiving like button it's just
[10462.78 → 10470.78] different depending on how someone's calling you it's incredibly stupid we concede the calendar
[10470.78 → 10482.62] for the acknowledgement of call history the apple nation has accepted the diplomatic oh, oh man so yeah
[10482.62 → 10489.42] I there are lots of things that I actually love about it that are objectively better dude the dedicated um
[10490.54 → 10496.30] the dedicated voice input button at the bottom of the screen that's just always right there whenever
[10496.30 → 10500.62] you have your keyboard up, and you don't have to long press, and it does punctuation automatically
[10500.62 → 10507.26] which is super cool there 's's tons of stuff that's perfect I've got an I've got one my swift
[10507.26 → 10513.66] key one so I use a third party keyboard right ah I've been using the same third party keyboard for so long i
[10513.66 → 10519.26] don't remember what normal one is so I use a third party keyboard and mine puts it way across the screen
[10519.82 → 10524.30] but with apple regardless of whether you're using a first party keyboard or a third party keyboard
[10524.30 → 10528.78] there's a voice input button that is independent of that and that sits under it sure which
[10530.06 → 10531.74] is really intuitive sure
[10534.22 → 10538.22] there you go we good you got a bonus one two things now yeah you got a bonus oh
[10539.18 → 10544.86] the android nation something is there a next topic no there's no other topic this is it leave
[10546.54 → 10551.58] uh okay sorry that it's not intuitive that there isn't Carson asks uh in your experience does
[10551.58 → 10561.02] iCloud no, no no I'm just kidding they want balance float plane chat wants balance they want a negative
[10561.02 → 10563.42] thing I'm going home
[10563.42 → 10574.86] I want to try one honestly I've never done it an iPhone yeah I tried an iPad and then
[10574.86 → 10578.38] immediately threw it out it's going to say I feel like you'd go insane I would probably
[10578.38 → 10581.42] what's wrong with the iPad no we're not talking about this I love the iPad
[10581.42 → 10585.90] I love the iPad shut up Linus dude have you ever used an android tablet I was going to say it is the
[10585.90 → 10590.06] superior tablet only with extreme custom firmware it's not even close
[10591.98 → 10597.90] Linus as someone who practices 321 backups are discs or Blu-rays viable I bought some recently
[10597.90 → 10603.18] to back up archive some important stuff but now I'm wondering if my efforts are better spent elsewhere
[10603.90 → 10609.18] um very viable no disc is totally a different class of storage device and tape are you familiar with
[10609.18 → 10616.94] them uh yeah but is he like actively using them uh well you don't they're just like an archival grade
[10616.94 → 10623.50] DVD essentially yeah, yeah so if you have like uh like legal documents or something like that I would
[10623.50 → 10630.46] say out of tape disc Blu-ray throw them on discs that's that's the way to go for something that you
[10630.46 → 10637.42] really want to not rot um I would trust that more than a hard drive in storage that's actually been a
[10637.42 → 10643.42] big problem for um data recovery companies is some of those drives are getting so old that even if
[10643.42 → 10649.26] they're brand new and sitting in storage they're just like they don't last forever whereas discs i
[10649.26 → 10652.54] think are rated for like a thousand years or something like that i really I don't know that
[10652.54 → 10656.38] they'd actually last that long, but they're rated for an extremely long time what is tape rated for
[10657.18 → 10661.50] um well it's more that it's more physically fragile a disc has no moving parts
[10661.50 → 10669.90] all right so i I would be personally a little more comfortable with disc um it's also like
[10669.90 → 10675.34] you can just get like a fireproof file cabinet and just you could store a functionally unlimited number
[10675.34 → 10682.30] of m discs in that compared to like tapes yeah um and the tapes would store more especially like
[10682.30 → 10688.70] more modern um more modern tape formats but if you're doing legal documents yeah then it's its purely
[10688.70 → 10694.62] archival tiny files yeah and yeah they're small files anyway and if you're going back to and
[10694.62 → 10699.42] having like smaller amounts and just like a ton of them and putting labels on them versus
[10699.42 → 10704.30] like how much stuff do you have to back up to this one tape before you finally put it in the
[10704.30 → 10710.30] archive I'd almost be afraid to like to have a pending have enough data pending that I'm going to fill
[10710.30 → 10714.06] up a tape before I can put it away do you kind of get what I mean don't you need special software for
[10714.06 → 10718.94] tape as well that remembers where all the data is on the tape itself you need uh and oh, and you need
[10718.94 → 10724.94] an expensive uh reader and writer whereas disc can be written on not quite commodity but slightly more
[10724.94 → 10733.42] expensive burners I didn't realize actually i yeah I didn't realize quite how not as long tape lasted as
[10733.42 → 10737.02] I thought yeah no disc sick had a longer I don't use it though
[10743.42 → 10748.54] cool I don't know just put it in a s3 bucket and let it be Amazon's problem to delete all your data
[10748.54 → 10754.30] is it is it not intuitive it's not very intuitive I just put everything on iCloud I mean
[10754.30 → 10761.50] if it lasts a long time they should call it disc yeah, but then they might think it's like Linus disc
[10762.14 → 10771.34] yeah might not be very intuitive no okay I'm a small vintage tech YouTuber with 1000 subs
[10771.34 → 10774.06] and you guys are a big influence they could call it long disc
[10774.06 → 10784.30] yeah I mean that might be a little unintuitive though because if the association is also Linus then
[10784.30 → 10790.62] people could get a false impression I mean you don't know well I guess i kind of know
[10792.38 → 10796.06] all right then Avon fox what about average second disc a disc
[10796.06 → 10797.02] a disc
[10800.86 → 10801.58] it's okay disc
[10803.90 → 10805.50] moderately acceptable disc
[10815.18 → 10823.42] okay all right hi yes Dan sorry hi I'm a small vintage YouTuber uh with about a thousand subs
[10823.42 → 10827.82] and you guys are a big influence to me would you ever take a small creator and have your team
[10827.82 → 10831.26] punch up a vid to see how much pro editing can drive views
[10833.74 → 10840.70] hmm interesting uh it's more than just editing I mean it's writing hosting editing topic selection
[10840.70 → 10846.06] thumbnail Ludwig did a fascinating pieces experiment a while ago actually where
[10846.06 → 10853.50] um he tried to see how successful he could be as a new YouTuber using none of his
[10855.18 → 10860.22] contacts not using his own likeness his own face or anything like that uh basically trying to pick a
[10860.22 → 10865.98] topic using I think it was like someone else's voice and doing a like image slash video with a voice
[10866.62 → 10871.58] uh with voiceover thing I don't know I don't know how I would find this uh Ludwig
[10871.58 → 10881.42] is it someone already find the link holy crikey dude yeah that was fast thanks nerdy or needle okay
[10881.82 → 10888.46] um Ludwig I made a secret YouTube channel to prove it's not luck this was wildly successful um
[10889.34 → 10897.18] this video is genuinely fascinating he talks about uh topic selection um he talked about how
[10897.18 → 10903.74] how he was able to promote it so like he wrote this video the title is perfect how a door made
[10903.74 → 10909.66] this man a million dollars like I would click on that I want to click it now yeah it's about something
[10909.66 → 10914.94] that he knows so it's about another streamer named mid chief I don't think he actually used like
[10914.94 → 10919.50] technically insider knowledge that someone else couldn't know I don't remember it's I watched this
[10919.50 → 10926.22] a long time ago so he kind of artificially through his own prior knowledge created a very meticulously
[10926.22 → 10931.34] researched video that someone else could have made yeah I think that was it I'm pretty sure
[10931.34 → 10935.58] um and then he shows about like promoting it stuff too so creating the channel he goes through
[10935.58 → 10941.26] all those details yeah making a thumbnail blah blah blah blah blah um and then at some point in time
[10941.26 → 10948.54] I don't remember where it is yeah he like promotes it because he chose to make a video about a streamer
[10948.54 → 10955.90] who does reaction videos so that he could link it in their stream, and they would likely watch it
[10955.90 → 10961.26] because you like if you if we is someone linked us a video like hey someone made a video I don't
[10961.26 → 10965.98] know it's its likely I don't think it's likely not for us not for us but a lot of other people
[10965.98 → 10973.10] we're not that edgy and especially not right now um, but a lot of streamers would so he links it to them
[10973.10 → 10978.70] and then they actually do watch it on stream at some point um that gets it a bunch of traction
[10978.70 → 10983.34] people liked the video he tells them to go subscribe whatever, and it starts the channel off, and it's
[10983.34 → 10989.26] it's like it's fascinating because he genuinely goes through all the steps um yeah this is
[10989.26 → 10996.54] like ms chief watching the video I guess yeah that's him watching it I don't remember if they actually
[10996.54 → 11005.90] show the like metrics of the channel what's the fair use situation of Ludwig using ms chief's reaction
[11005.90 → 11011.66] video of Ludwig's video that he made is it intuitive
[11015.26 → 11021.02] um yeah I don't I don't remember like how well it did but I mean first time video, and we're talking
[11021.02 → 11030.46] about views from different areas in the thousands like that's pretty cool yeah that's very cool so
[11030.46 → 11036.22] I don't know you can do it I don't necessarily think it's like just particularly having good editing
[11036.22 → 11042.30] or just having particularly good something else you need to bring everything together um for it to be
[11042.30 → 11048.62] intuitive yeah I mean I think that I think it would, I think it could be I think it could be
[11048.62 → 11055.66] an interesting experiment, but it would have to be we'd have to be all in like you'd basically we
[11055.66 → 11062.62] basically have to like bring a production crew to you, you'd have to kind of tell us okay here's
[11062.62 → 11071.18] five concepts that I have um we'd kind of have to massage them and go okay this is your best one this is
[11071.18 → 11077.74] probably your strongest angle for it oh one and a half million views okay yeah I mean it's riding on the
[11077.74 → 11083.34] back of this video which has 6.5 million views that's hard to evaluate now yeah um so we'd have
[11083.34 → 11088.86] to come all the way out there we'd probably have to kind of use our process right you'd tell us kind
[11088.86 → 11095.66] of everything you now and then I would lay out all the like the intro the story beats the conclusion
[11095.66 → 11101.18] we'd figure out how to package it can we make a YouTuber you would yeah you would sit there and you
[11101.18 → 11106.62] would read the would read the script but I don't know if uh is you're on float plane you might
[11106.62 → 11112.22] have seen this before um, but there's a there's a behind the scenes of me working with uh Ryan
[11112.22 → 11117.98] shroud and tom Peterson who both at the time read intel I think shroud's moved on I think tap's still there
[11117.98 → 11125.34] um, but basically there's a behind the scenes of me coaching them on their part in our video on intel arc
[11125.34 → 11132.94] uh where effectively I just say okay repeat exactly after me
[11135.26 → 11140.94] and what's really special about this product is and what's really special about this product is
[11140.94 → 11148.06] so essentially like like like showing them the exact intonation that they need in order to make the
[11148.06 → 11153.58] delivery a little bit more dynamic and engaging so I would probably have to do that unless you're
[11153.58 → 11158.06] amazing at it already which you might be I'm not you didn't even say exactly what your channel was
[11158.06 → 11163.10] so I'm not sure what it is and then from there we would have to kind of show you okay well what does
[11163.10 → 11167.18] it looks like to put together all the guidance for the visuals that are going to support this then we'd edit it
[11168.54 → 11175.02] then we'd edit it um and at that point I don't know it's tough like um
[11177.34 → 11183.42] we haven't really answered your question like how much pro editing drives it because there's so much
[11183.42 → 11191.42] more to the editing process than just the edit so I don't know what to tell you yeah
[11192.94 → 11198.46] Linus what advice would you give a young Canadian business owner I'm from Ontario run
[11198.46 → 11207.50] to LTT store and get these good deals um man
[11214.38 → 11224.78] it's been a long week uh be prepared the whole world scar let alone Canada is in um
[11224.78 → 11232.86] um has been you know in not great economics yeah space for a while now um this isn't a new thing
[11232.86 → 11240.06] everyone talks about the impact on consumers of inflation because most people are consumers rather
[11240.06 → 11246.94] than business owners, but businesses are absolutely impacted by it as well yeah and and and on both ends
[11246.94 → 11252.86] right because on the one side you've got your suppliers or your partners demanding more because of
[11252.86 → 11263.66] the impact of inflation on them so in a way you're kind of caught in a squeeze if you increase the price
[11263.66 → 11268.06] of your product some people might not be able to afford it anymore despite everything else because
[11268.06 → 11272.54] they might not be getting raises from their companies to keep up even if you're giving your people
[11273.18 → 11278.22] um raises so you're you're you might have less less um revenue and
[11278.22 → 11283.74] you're getting rid of it again has IFA asks uh Linus and Luke Trudeau or Pierre yes
[11285.74 → 11288.14] no we have a de facto two-party system Luke
[11290.38 → 11298.14] no I know, but yes wasn't it so cool when he was like I'm going to get rid of first post he was
[11298.14 → 11305.18] like it's done dude getting rid of it bro it's obviously really stupid, and you all voted me in for
[11305.18 → 11311.66] this reason so I'm definitely going to do it I am and then I didn't I know that there's been plenty of
[11311.66 → 11319.10] other things hell yeah that captain JT has um has screwed up demoted but the one that I am actually
[11319.10 → 11327.26] by far the most angry about is first past the post yeah it enrages me as well like election
[11327.26 → 11335.18] reform is something that um you know I would think that Canadians and Americans uh the need for
[11335.18 → 11339.34] election reform I would think is something that Canadians and Americans should probably
[11340.70 → 11347.66] all be pretty aligned on at the citizen level um and the fact that they that he promised he was
[11347.66 → 11351.26] going to get that done and then was like psych
[11354.30 → 11363.18] not cool JT not cool brush not cool brush there's like a way there was a own province for the
[11363.18 → 11370.70] Americans that's the same thing as a state yeah well it's not yeah that's fair yeah uh anyway it's like
[11370.70 → 11377.02] a state except it's like it's actually part of Canada instead of like wanting to be its own thing
[11377.02 → 11383.58] completely yeah yeah but except for Alberta and Quebec they also want to be their own thing
[11387.10 → 11392.94] except for a lot of them anyway I'm not sure how stoked the prairies are on the whole like
[11392.94 → 11398.86] commonwealth either, but you know whatever yeah bc kind of hides on the other side of the Rockies and
[11398.86 → 11405.18] pretends we're part of Washington yeah yeah we are us Washington state and Oregon state as far as i
[11405.18 → 11412.14] can tell like if the whole rest of the world went to crap I think i we could probably get Conn in
[11412.14 → 11416.14] there like i I think if the whole rest of the world went to crap we could all probably kind of come
[11416.14 → 11423.50] together and be like pacific northwest land rain land yeah yeah we like it wet um
[11425.42 → 11429.82] uh I was going to say yeah we had a had a provincial election here recently and i
[11429.82 → 11436.06] i I was looking into it because I was like I want to be an informed voter and i I found the like
[11436.06 → 11440.70] the platforms page for the three parties he sends this to me in the middle of the night he's like oh
[11440.70 → 11451.82] my god I was like what are you talking about the like it really felt like genuinely someone in grade four
[11451.82 → 11459.74] was like um this would be uh I don't know they're like ask ChatGPT like how should I make a bad
[11459.74 → 11463.42] political campaign, and they were like I don't know do this, and then they actually published it
[11463.42 → 11468.86] like it's stunning that people put this on paper and I mean that for both of the main two parties
[11468.86 → 11476.62] think about it when you were in grade 11 grade 12 okay, and you like to put together a project on something
[11477.34 → 11482.22] and you like did some research or whatever, and you did a presentation at the front of the class it
[11482.22 → 11491.18] seems like it went further than those that as far as I can tell a lot of people never really progress
[11491.18 → 11498.38] past that in terms of like their research and presentation and data compilation skills and
[11498.38 → 11503.50] and you would think you would think but of all I mean you know these are people in like a position of
[11503.50 → 11509.26] you know where it's really important for them to be able to do that's been a wild realization like
[11509.26 → 11515.74] like as an adult, and it's it still gets me it still gets me often where I'm like oh like this person's
[11515.74 → 11521.66] coming from I don't know this company or this area of expertise or whatever educational
[11521.66 → 11525.66] background and you start conversing with them, and you're like oh okay like this is going to be great
[11525.66 → 11530.30] I'm going to like I'm going to learn so much it's going to be so, so useful or interesting or whatever the
[11530.30 → 11535.10] scenario that you're in is, and then you start actually working with them, and you're like oh
[11538.22 → 11544.38] okay you're just like a dude well everyone's just a dude yeah like that's the thing right
[11545.02 → 11550.46] all right like we I don't know it's funny we leave you know school where we look around at all
[11550.46 → 11555.58] our peers, and we're like everyone's just a dude, and then we go into the real world, and we're like oh
[11555.58 → 11562.62] you're a librarian, and you're a dentist, and you're a bus driver, and you're this, and you're that and
[11562.62 → 11567.58] it's like no, no no, no you're all just dudes I think that you're doing those things I think the hope is
[11567.58 → 11571.82] that when you're in high school you're you're like progressing so much year to year that when you leave
[11571.82 → 11575.98] high school i think there's probably still some amount of assumption that like you're really
[11575.98 → 11581.26] going to be progressing a lot so like if someone worked in a field for 20 years you're going to expect
[11581.26 → 11586.78] like this unobtained feeling level of expertise I don't know that does exist
[11588.62 → 11594.54] sometimes it does oh it totally does for sure Luke I don't know what was more enlightening for me
[11595.42 → 11605.10] when I had children and realized that kids are just tiny adults yep or yeah sorry I keep
[11605.10 → 11614.06] or when the inverse dawned on me yeah yeah just a bunch of huge kids walking around
[11615.98 → 11625.10] and to be clear to be clear present party included I am not some kind of paragon of maturity let's be
[11625.10 → 11632.54] real here oh yeah dude i still feel like I have honestly a lot of the state the same wants and
[11632.54 → 11642.62] desires and I said inverse not converse that I did when I was 15 14 honestly like you know the approach
[11642.62 → 11646.70] might be different did we crystallize like way younger than I think people are comfortable
[11646.70 → 11653.82] thinking about yeah like going to my 20-year-high school of reunion I'm like yeah did you go yeah
[11653.82 → 11661.98] why not I haven't gone to anyone I don't know hot take don't be too cool to go to a reunion it's not
[11661.98 → 11668.54] even that i just yeah no what no it totally is I've yeah most of the people that I've talked to about it
[11668.54 → 11674.54] it basically boiled down to like I'm too cool to care about this no i I'm still in contact with
[11674.54 → 11680.22] honestly a lot of people from my high school sure so like I don't know we'll like go have a campfire
[11680.22 → 11685.98] with like 20 of them this is my reunion, but that's not the reunion yeah that's not the point of it I'm
[11685.98 → 11691.26] not saying I'm too cool for the other one I just don't care, but it's not because I'm too cool i
[11691.82 → 11693.18] objectively don't think I'm cool
[11697.18 → 11702.38] i just I'll let you guys unpack all of that I'm not going to go yeah yeah I'm not interested yeah
[11702.38 → 11710.14] charged nuclei says it's because everyone else is less cool deep blue v says sure Luke sure no i
[11710.14 → 11716.30] just says which makes you cool I think if you're not in contact with a bunch of people from your
[11716.30 → 11721.10] high school it could be good also in the age of Facebook I think that's another big change
[11721.82 → 11724.94] because there are people from my high school that I'm not actively in contact with
[11724.94 → 11729.74] that every once in a blue moon I'm like I wonder what they're up to and then I go click oh and then
[11729.74 → 11736.14] then I'm done I didn't need more than that I don't know look i I only stayed for about 15 minutes
[11737.50 → 11743.34] well because uh it was one of my kids' birthday party that day okay, and so I was like well i I'd like
[11743.34 → 11750.22] to go I'll go show my face say hi, and you know see what see if there's anyone that I recognize um
[11750.94 → 11757.66] some of them I didn't I I like I had a pretty big class and I was a loser so like I was actually not
[11757.66 → 11763.42] cool you had a pretty big class you didn't go to like an I thought you went to like a farm school
[11763.42 → 11768.70] basically well yeah well were you commuting well I had to drive a fair bit to get there it was like
[11768.70 → 11773.58] 20-minute drive how big was your great your you're my uh well when I say pretty big class I mean for
[11773.58 → 11778.86] me to remember all the names and faces like our yeah our school was about I want to say about 1500
[11778.86 → 11783.18] or something like that, so my class was a few hundred people I think yeah I think you're at a bigger
[11783.18 → 11789.42] school but part of the problem for me is that um I was in the like i was kind of in my like
[11789.42 → 11797.90] streamlined pod um so I was taking like challenge courses and ap courses so I saw a lot of the same
[11797.90 → 11804.14] like 25 people and I saw very little of the rest of the 90 of the class oh interesting i saw a
[11804.14 → 11810.62] lot of those folks and like I took metal art and jewellery um we had a tiny shop believe it or not
[11810.62 → 11817.10] so we like we only had one ap course if I remember correctly it was ap English oh yeah okay
[11818.06 → 11824.14] like there wasn't like so you were often like I was quite mixed amongst everybody we only for ap i
[11824.14 → 11833.34] think we only had English as well, so challenge was just our internal like uh name for like a slightly
[11833.34 → 11837.82] more challenging version of what is essentially the same curriculum I've never even heard of whereas ap is
[11837.82 → 11843.02] its own like separate entity that like organizes things oh Dan is saying we're over time oh we're
[11843.02 → 11851.50] over time yeah um you are okay Luke uh I am still good but not for like a long time okay cool yeah i just
[11851.50 → 11858.62] needed to check in yeah no that's good let me just wrap up pretty soon here yeah yeah I don't know I'm not
[11858.62 → 11866.22] like against it, i just don't care it's got Facebook spoken like a true cool guy sounds like a very cool
[11866.22 → 11872.30] answer I met somebody oh my goodness oh my you know somebody you know it's like whatever man like
[11873.10 → 11876.70] yeah we're all just kind of going through life I'm just not that into it, I could go to the high
[11876.70 → 11881.74] school reunion I could do it but like I don't know or I could do something way more important and sexy
[11883.34 → 11889.42] could hang out with my beautiful partner and my birds and my cool uh birds are pretty cool okay cool
[11889.42 → 11896.46] friend i I met somebody at the gym that uh I went I could lift something heavy to elementary and middle
[11896.46 → 11900.38] school with and that was cool, but they don't do like elementary and middle school reunions
[11901.10 → 11905.18] like those people I actually don't have contact with anymore any of them so you would go that was
[11905.18 → 11910.06] pretty face you would go to a grade seven reunion yeah actually interesting because I don't remember
[11910.06 → 11913.98] almost any of their names I don't have any contact with them anymore because that was pre-Facebook and
[11913.98 → 11918.86] stuff you know what's funny is I actually had the exact same thought like two weekends ago I was back
[11918.86 → 11926.14] in ladder and I was at shark's bar and grill with my grandparents the kids great-grandparents and
[11926.14 → 11933.42] the more I think of it this is more true and the waitress bore a striking resemblance to someone that
[11933.42 → 11938.46] I went to school with the age wasn't right like they were younger yeah but I was like holy crap i
[11938.46 → 11945.18] wonder if they're a relative of this girl I went to school with um i I didn't want to ask because
[11945.18 → 11949.50] people don't interact in person any more yeah, and it'd be like a weird thing to ask someone speaking
[11949.50 → 11955.90] is weird hey do you have a relative do you have a relative named whatever like you look like someone
[11955.90 → 11962.46] I know it almost seems like a pickup line you know oh yeah really I don't well you never know people
[11962.46 → 11966.94] people apparently just like don't approach each other in person any more so anything sounds like a
[11966.94 → 11971.18] pickup line i I would think so fair enough and I was just like it was unnecessary I don't actually
[11971.18 → 11977.82] care that much so i I wasn't going to like say anything weird uh Aragon says yeah that's a fair concern in
[11977.82 → 11983.10] my opinion make as advised says I accidentally picked up a girl that way okay so there you go I'm
[11983.10 → 11989.18] apparently not completely crazy I do think it would have been fine I was there with my wife and my kids
[11989.18 → 11994.62] and my grandparents like yeah that kind of diffuses a lot of that clearly I'm not making a move but never
[11994.62 → 12001.74] underestimate how scummy a dude could be so and modern relationships sometimes exactly who knows
[12001.74 → 12011.02] exactly who knows who those kids are actually born from yeah yep um what about second wife it says
[12011.02 → 12016.78] mine still anyway uh the point is it is made me think about someone that I hadn't thought about in
[12016.78 → 12023.02] yeah a bazillion year and I was like dude how cool would that be because this came on the heels of my
[12023.02 → 12029.18] aunt telling me because she ran into the mom of like my elementary school BFF who was like oh yeah he's
[12029.18 → 12034.86] like moving to north Vancouver and like has a kid and stuff and I was like it's crazy to think about
[12034.86 → 12043.10] what you know yeah um yeah like i I don't know i I think that'd be cool like i left my elementary
[12043.10 → 12053.34] school my first elementary school after grade two so like being able to be like hey remember me no i
[12053.34 → 12058.22] have I why i uh I'm pretty cool
[12064.78 → 12070.70] I don't even want to like to tell this story I mean I think you're committed now so let's go cool guy I think
[12070.70 → 12078.70] it was grade one I kissed some girl wow that's pretty cool like who the heck was that you kiss
[12078.70 → 12085.50] girls you don't even remember them no and this guy says no I don't think I'm that cool damn, damn
[12087.66 → 12092.86] I've held so many hands I don't even know I don't even know how many heads I've held
[12094.22 → 12098.78] if I remember correctly I've had so many cups of tea if I remember correctly one of us was like hurt or
[12098.78 → 12105.50] something I pulled on so many pigtails my god if I remember correctly I got so many cooties I'm
[12105.50 → 12112.22] just going to go for it anyway and uh whichever one actually like initiated it did so because like
[12112.22 → 12115.90] their parents would do that when they were hurt to try to calm them down yeah it wasn't it wasn't
[12115.90 → 12120.78] we're in grade like one it wasn't what you thought wow he's been emotionally intelligent and caring since
[12120.78 → 12126.46] wow my look at this guy god you're cool god you're so cool I can't handle you guys
[12127.10 → 12133.90] damn my mind paradox says uh yeah definitely friends from grade school I'd love to see again
[12133.90 → 12139.50] but high school no interest in talking to all to any of them now I have now i have a hypothesis
[12139.50 → 12144.62] here and that is not that the people you went to grade school with are like better in some way but
[12144.62 → 12147.50] rather that they were at a stage in their life where they hadn't turned into complete
[12147.50 → 12153.26] f***ING a**holes yet and so that makes the elementary school reunion interesting though I see
[12153.26 → 12157.02] okay because you didn't get to see that process so it's like what happened in the gap
[12159.02 → 12164.30] how did you get why how do you look like this basically yeah how'd you go from like that kid
[12164.30 → 12171.74] that was fun to play soccer with to like I don't know who knows adfaxelstijev says Luke's just a
[12171.74 → 12182.14] stand-up guy stop oh man yeah okay uh what's going on more we got yeah I got some more merch messages
[12182.14 → 12187.74] okay we got some is there more we got some cool people sending merch messages yes how many is there
[12187.74 → 12192.38] left you wish they were Luke let's let's try to let's try to power through these a little bit okay
[12193.58 → 12198.94] I wish there was merino underwear available they're wonderful do you know why some websites don't let you
[12198.94 → 12204.46] open certain links in a new I hate that oh my god I know as a habitual control clicker it's infuriating
[12204.46 → 12209.50] when I can't I hate it so much also middle-clicking does the same thing, and it's my favourite I hate it
[12209.50 → 12215.82] so much I hate it so much okay so watch this okay so if I'm in the dashboard and I want to
[12215.82 → 12222.38] switch accounts and I right-click and I right-click to oh my god i left-clicked okay it doesn't matter
[12222.38 → 12227.90] the point is if I want to switch accounts and I right-click I want to open a new tab where is my open
[12227.90 → 12238.22] in a new job why isn't it there it's not intuitive I love this man
[12240.94 → 12247.90] not me just making sure you can do the yes that works okay cool all right good so vindicated uh is
[12247.90 → 12253.98] there any pricing available for the commuter backpack I'm hoping 150 or less so I can justify upgrading my
[12253.98 → 12265.74] upgrading my upgrading to my upgrading to my wife from the 50 back grab I'm still using from high school
[12267.34 → 12269.02] it's just that is what it says
[12271.34 → 12274.86] this is the least intuitive merch message I've ever read to my wife
[12274.86 → 12279.74] upgrading to my wife from the 50 backpack where are you storing things in your wife that's cool
[12281.02 → 12289.58] uh that's quite the upgrade though I can't do this um not a very intuitive upgrading from my wife
[12290.38 → 12295.82] upgrading my wife from the 50 backpack I'm still using from high school okay I hurt my hand
[12295.82 → 12305.02] I'm not surprised what about it's not too bad it's not too bad um uh we're not announcing the pricing
[12305.02 → 12311.10] yet i we announced that a little early I think the backpack your bag well we got a got a got a
[12311.10 → 12317.34] wait list we got an email newsletter gotcha yeah yeah yeah no, no we got a drum up we ordered a few
[12317.34 → 12325.82] oh based on the newsletter or just preemptively just based just based not on anything just
[12325.82 → 12336.70] based like on a like on a turkey base yeah yeah get that meat yeah get that meat gravy
[12338.94 → 12343.02] okay we need to get out of here this is what happens if we go past 8 30.
[12343.02 → 12351.90] next person keep going hey dill I was using my Ltd stubby to fix my dishwasher before when
[12351.90 → 12355.98] show nice uh how well can I expect it to hold up to water I don't know you tell me uh it should
[12355.98 → 12361.50] be fine the bits might rust a little bit because they're like iron and stuff yeah yeah shaft's okay
[12361.50 → 12364.70] yeah yeah just baste it baste shaft
[12364.70 → 12373.34] all right keep going okay all right sorry, sorry the last one I got for you hey
[12376.54 → 12382.38] with your focus on transparency will there be any more how Ltd makes money videos I know
[12383.50 → 12389.98] were used against you but uh can you look past that I really hope that people were
[12389.98 → 12396.46] not here during the start of the show chat understood it apparently but yeah um
[12398.38 → 12403.26] I think someone internally pitched a little while ago it might have been Adam I think it was Adam I'm
[12403.26 → 12406.46] not sure don't quote me on that I might be wrong about that someone pitched it internally
[12406.46 → 12413.50] a little while ago I think we are due for one um I don't know guys like it's uh it's one of those
[12413.50 → 12419.82] things where someone in full of my chest I wouldn't the old video still basically apply no I mean and
[12419.82 → 12425.10] that's the thing right and that that's why it's changed that transparency is not just once right like
[12425.10 → 12433.34] if you have a window in into the front of your house right, and you open it for a second and
[12433.34 → 12439.26] then you close it that's not transparency that's a glimpse you know uh transparency is a process it's a
[12439.26 → 12451.18] mindset it's ongoing and um, and so I think in the interest of transparency yeah um I'd like to do
[12451.18 → 12457.98] another one but after sort of experiencing the way that people take what I say in those kinds of
[12457.98 → 12467.66] behind the scenes looks and extrapolate or um or twist um what I'm saying to turn it into something that i
[12467.66 → 12474.38] didn't say I don't know it it definitely makes me like that one time that
[12474.38 → 12481.02] you said that the iPhone was an unintuitive mess yeah and had no redeeming qualities yes like the
[12481.02 → 12488.22] time I said that um it's really challenging right because i I can't reasonably expect people every
[12488.22 → 12493.42] individual person out there to be familiar with everything I've ever said right and so you'll see
[12493.42 → 12499.98] like bad faith statements like Linus always criticizes the iPhone he never criticizes android
[12499.98 → 12510.94] so mean um and I think this is one of those content pieces for us that um have a super high potential
[12510.94 → 12517.98] for that for people to see just this and not see the bigger picture or to see it and not believe it
[12517.98 → 12522.22] and um and I'm putting myself in a position where they just wouldn't have been thinking about it
[12522.94 → 12528.38] if I didn't bring it up I think that's probably the biggest danger is I talk about like you know
[12528.38 → 12532.86] I talk about the sponsorships so I talk about integrations or I talk about merch or I talk about
[12532.86 → 12537.58] float plane, or you know all the other ways that um that Linus media group makes money, and you've got
[12537.58 → 12541.42] you know the people on the one side that are going that couldn't be all of it what are they hiding
[12541.98 → 12545.66] right, and then you've got the um, and then you've got the people that are like
[12545.66 → 12551.58] like oh my god I can't believe that they make so much off of like sponsorships and merch that they
[12551.58 → 12558.86] can pay like you know 100 people um i I didn't you know I didn't think about that before I thought
[12558.86 → 12564.86] that you know Linus was just my friend or whatever, and it's like bro why is it a conversation that I'm
[12564.86 → 12569.82] even opening up at this point like during wench is you know two and a half three hours into Sancho or
[12569.82 → 12574.78] whatever we are right now whatever yeah we're three and a half hours into Sancho it's like yeah fine we can
[12574.78 → 12579.02] kind of talk about this stuff because realistically the only people are going to make that make it past
[12579.02 → 12585.90] me insulting their precious iOS are going to be people who I think can at least based android users
[12585.90 → 12596.46] let's go I think are people who can um see the bigger picture of what we're trying to say and see
[12596.46 → 12600.38] that you know for all of our flaws we're trying and sort of take things um
[12600.38 → 12607.18] um take things that we say and take the things that we do um
[12610.14 → 12616.78] if a positive with a set of positive assumptions rather than a set of negative assumptions whereas
[12616.78 → 12623.82] like a mainline channel video it's not really like that so we'll see uh I think that uh right now this
[12623.82 → 12628.38] is not a good time of year to go bug the accounting department to create a bunch of extra like presentation
[12628.38 → 12636.38] slides for us, they've got to do uh a lot of new good but new goalposts things to work on yeah
[12636.38 → 12643.66] but maybe next year we'll see okay uh can canal asks timeline for backpack carabiners you should
[12643.66 → 12646.54] have them already if you don't contact support
[12649.58 → 12656.38] and I'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[12659.18 → 12665.18] dude it was so hard not to talk about this oh you can't lean over here I know it's fine
[12668.54 → 12671.18] I know right
