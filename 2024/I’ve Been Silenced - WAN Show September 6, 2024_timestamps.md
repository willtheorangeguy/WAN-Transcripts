I said I won't put as much effort in it as I used to, but it still got so long... Anyway, it fits the "supplemental" description.
Due to the number of topics, I'm dropping bolding the topics. Consider anything not intended to be significant segments.
Subtopics _(the indented ones)_ are very contextual from the the flow of the source topic, so even the subtopics may not be as accurate.

*Reminder:* If you're searching for a certain dialogue/mention, it's a good idea to open up the transcript and search what's been said from there. It might get some words wrong, but the automation works for the most part.

Let me know of sub/topic rephrasings/suggestions/corrections, if any.
Hope this helps. Thank you!
