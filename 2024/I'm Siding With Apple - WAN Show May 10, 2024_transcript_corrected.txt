[0.00 → 4.36] What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show. We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[4.46 → 12.80] I hope Apple launched their M4 processor bringing ray tracing to the iPad and Microsoft has caught
[12.80 → 19.96] heat from sudden game studio closures including the maker of surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush.
[20.88 → 27.78] At risk of spoiling a little bit of this topic, the worst part of it is, was it just after the
[27.78 → 33.30] studio closure or just before the studio closure that Microsoft basically came out and said,
[33.90 → 38.82] we need more games like those games they just made. I don't remember which one it was, but it was
[38.82 → 45.74] very closely tied. We'll get into it. What else we got today? Yeah. You know, Sony, I'm just gonna pull
[45.74 → 50.60] this one out. Sony just keeps digging. We thought they were out of it. You know, they added PSN to
[50.60 → 57.12] Hell divers, and then they're like, okay, we'll take it away. And it's not back, but the reason why
[57.12 → 64.48] everyone was actually mad is back. Dude, Sony is the classicist example of a company that never learns.
[64.76 → 72.68] Yeah. They never, ever learn. Yeah, and we'll talk about that. Also, there's new handheld news.
[72.94 → 79.20] DOG Ally X, Nintendo Switch 2, stuff's coming. You picked that? What else is there? All right.
[79.20 → 79.24] All right.
[79.24 → 79.30] All right.
[87.12 → 105.40] The show is brought to you today by AG1, Ridge, and Back blaze. Why don't we jump right into our
[105.40 → 114.78] headline topic, which is, of course, the ad that Apple released for the new iPad? Let's get through
[114.78 → 121.50] what the new iPad is. Apple officially launched their new M4 chip. Surprising, I mean, anyone who
[121.50 → 128.14] doesn't pay attention to leaks, there was some speculation earlier this week that Twitter's AI
[128.14 → 137.56] news summary feature may have access to scheduled tweets because of how accurate its summary of the
[137.56 → 141.98] upcoming Apple event was. I don't think that that's been confirmed. I don't think that that's
[141.98 → 146.38] necessarily gone anywhere. I haven't followed it up, so maybe it did, but I saw that. Furthermore, I thought it
[146.38 → 151.90] was pretty funny. Anyway, the new M4 chip is broadly similar to the M3, but has an additional two
[151.90 → 159.90] efficiency cores and a 20% increase in memory bandwidth. Apple is also claiming our powerful
[159.90 → 166.76] neural engine, and that's where some of the speculation about why we're getting an M4 chip before
[166.76 → 173.88] they've even seemingly finished rolling out the M3 family. I mean, anyone else notice that the Mac
[173.88 → 182.44] studio still has an M2 series chip in it? I mean, are Mac users, and by Mac users, I don't mean Apple
[182.44 → 191.32] users. I mean, specifically Mac, not MacBook. Are Mac users feeling like just Apple just straight up
[191.32 → 198.20] doesn't care about you at all? Every single time, every single time, they come back, and they're like,
[199.00 → 207.00] no, no, we hear you. You matter to us. Here's a new Mac Pro with upgradable memory and upgradable GPU.
[207.00 → 214.12] By the way, we're never going to rev this again, and bubble. Oh, wait, no, we haven't forgotten about you.
[214.12 → 220.68] Here's a Mac Pro that uses Apple Silicon. By the way, none of the upgrades and stuff are there, and it's like
[221.56 → 225.08] way more expensive for reasons we can't fully explain.
[225.08 → 231.00] Uh, uh, also we're just not gonna we're just not going to revise it. You're going to be on M2 silicon
[231.00 → 238.52] forever, and then our other products. Literally, the iPad is going to get M4 before you guys get M3. It's,
[238.52 → 244.28] it's, it's kind of, it's kind of mind-blowing at this point. Anyway, the more powerful neural engine is
[244.28 → 252.04] fuelling speculation that Apple has accelerated their plans for M4 with all this AI in the news
[252.04 → 255.88] and to make sure that their stock price doesn't go down because they don't have enough AI. Honestly,
[256.60 → 263.72] I kind of doubt it. Realistically, Apple is at a level where people do not invest in Apple for
[263.72 → 272.04] AI. People invest in Apple because they have a very, very beautiful, wonderful balance sheet on a
[272.04 → 279.72] quarterly basis. Um, anywho, uh, benchmarks from Geek bench show the M4 easily beating and tells Core
[279.72 → 285.32] i9-14900KS in terms of single core performance. Of course, we've talked about this a fair bit in the
[285.32 → 291.80] past. Geek bench is not the be-all and end-all of performance. It's just convenient to run because it
[291.80 → 297.08] happens to be cross-platform, and the chip is launching in the first iPad to feature ray tracing
[297.56 → 305.32] and hardware accelerated mesh shading. Man, if only they would let you run macOS on it. It would be
[305.32 → 313.00] like kind of the best macOS machine with a little folio. Um, Apple also announced the new M2 powered
[313.00 → 319.48] iPad Air, which is actually slightly thicker than the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is crazy thin and that's
[319.48 → 326.20] where some of the marketing hubbub has come from. It is. If you're going to call it Air and have it be
[326.20 → 331.48] the thicker version, that is weird. I mean, look. It's cool that the Pro is so thin, I'm just saying.
[332.20 → 342.28] Look, Luke, this is the company what brought you Mac Pro, Mac Pro, Mac Pro, all of which are completely
[342.28 → 348.12] different products with completely different characteristics. They don't, the trash can one
[348.12 → 354.20] doesn't even look the same as the other ones. This is also the company what brought you, uh, oh,
[354.20 → 360.36] I'm trying to think, ah, shoot, no, I was going somewhere with this, but oh yeah, yeah. Ultra Max.
[363.16 → 371.00] Pro Ultra, I don't even, I don't even remember. Literally their most important product line
[371.00 → 377.40] has gotten bloated to the point where it's kind of a mess. The iPhone used to be simple. It used to be,
[378.28 → 383.80] here's the new iPhone. Oh, by the way, you can still buy the old iPhone and it's cheaper.
[383.80 → 388.84] Yeah. Then we got, I'm trying to think of the exact order that things happened. Then we got the SE.
[388.84 → 389.80] The Mini was first? Oh no, yeah.
[390.28 → 395.40] And the SE kind of made sense. It was clearly separated from the rest of the product line. It
[395.40 → 402.04] didn't have the same premium feel, you know, unapologetically plastic, uh, but, but kind of
[402.04 → 407.32] made sense. And then things just got completely off the rails because now we've got, we've got pros,
[407.32 → 411.80] we've got pro maxes, we've got... X is where it really went off the, off the rails for me.
[411.80 → 414.76] Sorry, X? iPhone X? iPhone X? iPhone X?
[414.76 → 416.60] What? Oh, the iPhone X, right.
[416.60 → 423.88] It's just like, that was where they, they really lost me. Um, yeah, so I'm excited. While we're
[423.88 → 426.60] talking about naming stuff, I'm going to allude to something I want to talk about later. I don't
[426.60 → 430.60] want to talk about it now though, but, uh, yeah, like what the heck are they going to call the
[430.60 → 436.84] the new Switch? Oh, well. Because a lot of news articles are saying Switch 2, but all they said is the
[436.84 → 441.32] There's no way Nintendo. Successor to the Switch. There's no way Nintendo calls it Switch 2.
[441.32 → 444.92] Well, we'll get, we'll get into that later. All right, fine. Fine. Make a note in the Luke section.
[444.92 → 450.84] Okay, okay. Uh, they also launched the Pencil Pro, which is only compatible with the 2024 iPad Pro
[450.84 → 457.24] and iPad Air. And another notable detail is that upgrading the M4 iPad Pro to the one terabyte model
[457.24 → 463.48] will also get you a more powerful 10 core processor versus the nine core standard one, which is a very
[463.48 → 468.84] MacBook like. I thought it was, uh, I thought it was the 512 as well. Uh, so don't, don't quote me on
[468.84 → 473.16] that, but definitely you can get a more powerful processor by upgrading the storage. I guess,
[473.16 → 480.68] is this Apple sort of tacitly acknowledging that people, um, that, that maybe they shouldn't
[480.68 → 484.68] be charging so much for just storage upgrades? So they're going to nerf the processor in their
[484.68 → 488.36] lower tier model so that you feel like you're getting more value. I'm, I'm actually not sure.
[488.36 → 496.60] Anyway, there was an ad for the new iPad Pro and I have what I suspect is going to be a pretty
[496.60 → 503.56] unpopular take on it. I wonder if it'll be unpopular with people here. Here is the commercial.
[503.80 → 508.20] We're going to watch it. Which is still up by the way, in spite of the fact, actually, no,
[508.26 → 512.80] let's not watch the whole thing because I don't feel like getting, you know, DMCA'd by Apple. But the
[512.80 → 518.64] point is basically there's a bunch of stuff. Uh, you know, you got a piano, you got a metronome,
[518.64 → 523.92] you got a bunch of what looks like DJ equipment, a filming slate, bunch of stuff.
[523.92 → 531.30] Uh, there are some lenses and some art supplies. They crush it under a gigantic, what appears to be a
[531.30 → 536.78] hydraulic press, but I don't know, might be a prop, who knows? Uh, and then they lift it back up to
[536.78 → 543.46] reveal the new iPad Pro. Look at it go. Oh my goodness. Look, okay. Legitimately looks
[543.46 → 550.16] incredible. That is very, very, which is, which is pretty darn cool. So this has caused a pretty
[550.16 → 554.06] big stir. I'm going to, I'm going to read the notes, and then I'm going to kind of give you my
[554.06 → 560.66] take. Sure. Um, the commercial features of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Apple, uh, no,
[560.70 → 565.76] we'll get to that. The ad was particularly unpopular in Japan with some people calling it
[565.76 → 571.52] disgusting and evil. Uh, a few Japanese commentators connected this revulsion to the
[571.52 → 576.36] traditional Shinto belief that tools and household belongings can come to possess their own kind of
[576.36 → 580.56] soul with the passing of time and therefore deserve to be treated with a level of dignity
[580.56 → 588.30] and respect. Uh, Hugh Grant came out saying, uh, hold on, let me see if I can find, uh, quote,
[588.56 → 595.50] Apple, iPad, uh, pro. Hold on. Let me see if I can find it. Um, he called it the destruction
[595.50 → 605.30] of the human experience courtesy of Silicon Valley. Um, so this way until he finds out about AI.
[606.60 → 612.02] Apple seems, okay, this is from my notes to have intended this as a metaphor for how all the
[612.02 → 617.00] functions of these items are included with the iPad. However, others, particularly artists saw it
[617.00 → 623.56] as a dystopian visual metaphor of an impersonal industrial machine destroying symbols of human
[623.56 → 635.64] creativity. All right. So here comes the hot take. I'm with Apple on this one. Also, I think Apple
[635.64 → 642.28] is still with Apple on this one. They apologized for it and left the ad up and left the ad up because
[642.28 → 652.10] I think the cold, hard truth is that Apple recognizes that this is a storm in a teacup and that people
[652.10 → 662.24] generally speaking understood what they were saying. And here's the thing I get that art is in the eye of
[662.24 → 670.36] the beholder and the meaning of art can be in the eye of, of the interpreter, right? And in many cases,
[670.36 → 678.26] there, there, there are many examples of, of art where the, the writer, be it of a song or the, or the,
[678.26 → 687.38] or the painter, be it of a, of a painting goes out of their way to never completely explain what it
[687.38 → 692.74] meant. And, and that's, that's part of the fun of it, right? Where they're basically like, no, I want,
[693.02 → 700.40] I want you to form your own opinion. I want you to find your own meaning in this. Obviously it had some
[700.40 → 705.42] kind of meaning to me, or maybe it didn't, who knows? Obviously it had some kind of meaning to me,
[705.42 → 710.86] but I want to know, I want to know what it means to you. Um, so people, if you guys can, I'm,
[711.36 → 716.10] examples are escaping me. So float plane chat, if you want to hit me with a, with a couple of famous
[716.10 → 722.04] examples of that, that would be great just so that everyone can kind of enjoy that. Um, but that's not
[722.04 → 732.02] what this is. Apple has come out and said what they meant by it. So for us to go, well, it meant this
[732.02 → 739.16] other thing I think is, what did they say specifically? Is this something you already said? Did I miss it?
[739.66 → 742.56] Actually, you know what? No, I don't think that, I don't think they did say it. I think probably
[742.56 → 745.86] they thought it was obvious. Sorry. I was going based on our notes. They seem to have
[745.86 → 750.68] intended this as a metaphor for how all the functions of these items are included within the iPad. And to me,
[750.68 → 758.24] that is, that is pretty obvious. Um, Tarantino in that stupid briefcase says lucid Lucy. Okay. Yeah.
[758.30 → 764.38] Okay. So there that's, that's a good example. Um, but yeah, I would, I would have thought that would
[764.38 → 772.32] be pretty obvious. And to me, to, to take what you were watching and say, oh, well, we don't care about
[772.32 → 777.98] the, the, the human artistry of anything anymore is sort of silly because Apple's not saying,
[777.98 → 787.34] they didn't put humans in a hydraulic press. They put tools in a hydraulic press. And all they were
[787.34 → 795.24] saying was, here's another tool. Here's a tool that does so many of the things this, this thing does.
[795.38 → 803.86] And I think that, I think it's manufactured outrage. There's a there's a take from someone
[803.86 → 809.40] at flow plane chat from a lot earlier in the show. Um, Current MKD that says, Linus, I heard your
[809.40 → 813.66] point on the iPad ad. I think you've missed the point of why people are upset. It's tone-deaf
[813.66 → 817.78] because the iPad doesn't replace needing a piano or, and hold on, let me get to the end. Um,
[817.86 → 823.22] it's tone-deaf because, uh, the iPad doesn't replace any of your piano or paint or TV or the other
[823.22 → 828.00] things. The iPad isn't able to do the tactile feel and artistic expression from having objects.
[828.00 → 833.50] The iPad is a tool that can support those tasks. Your take that people are upset because the iPad
[833.50 → 841.24] doesn't replace the artist is not the reason why people are upset. Red Bull doesn't give you wings.
[841.64 → 846.44] I don't know. It does. It's one thing that's interesting to me is do we know? Because I've seen
[846.44 → 851.62] some people say so, but I haven't seen any official statements for it. Do we know if it was CGI or real?
[851.62 → 860.16] Um, I'm not sure. Because it doesn't look real to me. At least some parts of it,
[860.82 → 865.46] like the, uh, when it squishes the face of the thing, the little toy thing.
[867.14 → 872.82] Yeah. There were things that looked wrong to me. Um, but I don't know. Yeah. I'm not sure. So I
[872.82 → 878.90] don't want to, uh, apparently it's CGI with a lot of video, but how do we know that? Because I've seen
[878.90 → 884.48] people say that, but I've only seen random people on like in, in threads say that I haven't seen any
[884.48 → 891.22] official thing saying that. So, okay. Avulsion says Linus, I see your point. However, there's a
[891.22 → 895.56] strong argument that even works with an established intended meaning, uh, where it can have meaning
[895.56 → 901.88] beyond that, which is up to the interpretation of the viewer. And that's fair enough, but getting
[901.88 → 908.90] angry about it isn't really helpful. If someone's intent was not the thing that you see in something,
[908.90 → 917.38] then we have to be sort of, we have to acknowledge that we have to kind of go, Oh, okay. Well that,
[917.52 → 923.82] that, that immediate emotional reaction that I had, um, was not your intention.
[924.04 → 927.80] And I think in general, and we've, we've said this when people really like ads and stuff too,
[927.80 → 936.58] is like, just have your general like balance and happiness and whatnot, a lot less connected to
[936.58 → 942.20] brands. Like when, when Wendy's and other various brands were running wild on Twitter there for a
[942.20 → 946.20] while and people were like emotionally invested in like these brands dunking on people, it was like
[946.20 → 951.84] just as cringe. Because it's like, dude, it's just marketing. It's just branding. Just ignore it.
[952.42 → 955.32] This isn't like good for you. You're losing the game.
[955.32 → 961.98] So in general, I, uh, I think this is much ado about nothing. I think they're intended.
[962.50 → 971.20] Uh, I think their intended purpose was very clear. Um, I, I, I, I think that we have far more
[971.20 → 979.78] pressing concerns, especially because the, the iPad has been such an artist's tool and yeah,
[979.78 → 984.90] you're right. It doesn't replace a piano in the same way that a synth doesn't replace a piano
[984.90 → 993.76] right. But it absolutely is an instrument of artistic expression. And to deny that would be,
[993.76 → 1000.12] I, I, I, I don't know. I, I, I, I think if I use words,
[1000.12 → 1007.74] So is your phone. So is, so is anything. So is a garbage can lid. Yeah. Anything can be a tool for
[1007.74 → 1014.28] artistic expression. And all Apple was trying to say was that this tool for artistic expression
[1014.28 → 1023.58] can combine metaphorically the functions of everything you see here. They obviously recognize
[1023.58 → 1031.52] that a Swiss army knife. Okay. Is not the world's best knife. It is not the world's best pair of
[1031.52 → 1037.54] tweezers, and it is not the world's best toothpick. In fact, it is not a toothpick at all because I don't
[1037.54 → 1043.64] know about you guys, but for me, the toothpick gets lost immediately. Okay. Immediately. It's just
[1043.64 → 1049.24] garbage. But that doesn't mean if, if, if Swiss Victorinox or whatever, the, the company that makes
[1049.24 → 1055.52] Swiss army knives, if they made a commercial like that, where they took, you know, a shovel and,
[1055.60 → 1061.20] and a whatever, and they, and they compressed it all, they compressed it all into this Swiss army knife.
[1061.20 → 1066.84] I'd love to see someone dig with this. Dude, dude, we wouldn't be having the same conversation.
[1066.98 → 1070.42] No, probably not. I mean, there's, there's a million other people are linking all of these in,
[1070.42 → 1076.04] in, in full plan chat right now. There's a ton of other ads that are like effectively the same thing.
[1076.04 → 1082.24] Um, like people posted this one from LG. Where's my thing? Here it is.
[1083.60 → 1090.50] Someone's like, uh, by your logic, a firearm could be used as artistic expression. Have you ever seen
[1090.50 → 1099.34] a firearm with a skin on it? No, seriously. There's, there's, I guarantee you someone has tried to draw a
[1099.34 → 1105.20] picture with a firearm at some point. Yeah. And people used to do, uh, not used to, they still do it
[1105.20 → 1110.46] like stipple art on, on plastic and leathery ones. And they used to do wood engraving. And look,
[1110.74 → 1116.16] you might not like metal engraving that form of art. You might not like what they're expressing.
[1116.42 → 1121.96] What if what they're expressing is their, is their Second Amendment right to bear arms and shoot guns
[1121.96 → 1130.44] at things. That's human expression. You don't get to just say, well, that's all. Where's your violin?
[1130.44 → 1137.48] Like, no, literally anything can be a form of human expression. Yes. Even a gun.
[1137.98 → 1141.56] Trig said painting firearms is huge in the industry. Now painting firearms has been huge
[1141.56 → 1146.76] in the industry for a long time. Do you guys remember the video of the guy playing a Christmas
[1146.76 → 1151.66] song firing a gun? No, I haven't actually, I haven't actually seen that. It isn't, it isn't my
[1151.66 → 1155.86] point though. It isn't my point. We're not saying it's good or bad artistic expression. We're,
[1155.86 → 1162.40] we're saying it just, it just is. And you don't get to, you don't get to gate keep it. Um, so yeah,
[1162.46 → 1169.30] sorry guys. I don't, I don't care. Um, I actually fully defend Apple in this case. Okay. So in,
[1169.42 → 1174.64] so do you, they should leave the ad up. Do you, so you defend them leaving the ad up and not
[1174.64 → 1180.92] apologizing for it? They did apologize, but they left it up. I'm with them on it. Do you think it's a
[1180.92 → 1186.08] good ad if, if there was no controversy? Yeah. Nobody talked about it because nobody talked
[1186.08 → 1191.72] about the bunch of other ads that are exactly the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. I, I know. I think,
[1191.82 → 1197.32] I think it's a good ad. I think their previous ad was better. Which one? Um, someone linked this
[1197.32 → 1200.74] as well, but I remember this, and I think we even talked about it on WAN show, but this one,
[1201.80 → 1206.16] you remember this ad? What is this? What's a computer? Yeah. This is not a better ad. No,
[1206.26 → 1209.62] I don't even, I don't even know what the'm looking at right now.
[1210.92 → 1218.78] What do you mean? Like, okay. What I can, I can draw on it. Yeah. I think the whole point of this
[1218.78 → 1221.86] ad was that she can do a lot of the things that you can do on a computer, but she can do it on an
[1221.86 → 1229.44] iPad. That's all it was. I guess it just, it, it takes a really long time to get to the point.
[1230.04 → 1237.94] That's fair. That is a that is a that is a 68-second ad. Yeah. So I guess, okay, hold on. I
[1237.94 → 1243.10] should clarify then. I don't think that, I don't think it's bad. Furthermore, I think that it is. You think the
[1243.10 → 1248.64] compression one is better? It's struggling to hold my attention. And so the percentage of that,
[1248.84 → 1255.78] that I would be likely to watch before clicking skip ad is much lower. Whereas I think that the
[1255.78 → 1265.70] hydraulic press ad is very much designed for now. Interesting. I don't know what the music playing
[1265.70 → 1270.66] was. I watched it on music, but like basically I'm sure there's some dramatic music, but like
[1270.66 → 1276.94] something exciting is going to happen. Right. And they do a great job of kind of cutting in for,
[1277.00 → 1282.90] for dynamic, interesting looking, colourful closeups. You, you, you kind of can't look away from it.
[1282.90 → 1290.38] And that, that grippingness while without being so explicit, that's the other thing like that iPad
[1290.38 → 1295.08] ad, that's something I could have storyboarded. Well, yeah, I don't know. Let's just have a little
[1295.08 → 1303.12] girl, like do a bunch of stuff with it that it does like, that's not, it's, it, it says it explicitly.
[1303.54 → 1309.98] Whereas the hydraulic press ad says it implicitly, which maybe was their mistake because it allows
[1309.98 → 1315.50] people to kind of insert their own narrative here about you're destroying AI. Yeah. AI destroying art
[1315.50 → 1321.48] and not having respect for, for, you know, classical instruments of, of creation. Right. But
[1321.48 → 1328.18] no, I wanted to compare the views on them because I know this iPad ad actually got,
[1328.26 → 1334.50] you know, 2.3 million views. Yeah. Um, but I can't find what's a computer actually posted by
[1334.50 → 1338.94] Apple. That's because Apple pulls down their old marketing collateral instead of just leaving it
[1338.94 → 1345.34] up. Uh, in fact, they, they sent, if I, they sent some kind of legal notice to someone who, uh,
[1345.42 → 1350.30] archived all of their old advertising collateral and were basically like, you need to take this down.
[1350.34 → 1355.08] You need to delete it all. And it's like, sorry, what? Like, that's lame. Because they've got some cool
[1355.08 → 1362.42] advertising you guys. You should, you literally pay money to have people watch this. And then you're like,
[1362.42 → 1366.48] no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't keep, don't keep watching it. That's, Oh, that's the old one.
[1366.78 → 1372.14] So to be clear, there, there are still plenty of things that I think Apple is so far up their own
[1372.14 → 1377.28] asses about that they will never see the light of day ever again. Oh, yeah. This commercial just
[1377.28 → 1380.60] isn't one of them. Why don't we jump into our next topic here? You want to pick it?
[1381.56 → 1387.24] People are also pointing out, this is an interesting one. Trig in, uh, in full plane chat is pointing out
[1387.24 → 1395.78] that the like original iPhone one commercial do try to make effectively the same point that they're
[1395.78 → 1398.92] like, we're playing not really cause not musical instruments, but they're trying to show that like
[1398.92 → 1403.30] the iPhone is replacing lots of different objects. And if you remember a lot of the marketing around
[1403.30 → 1406.82] smartphones, and they originally came out was like, you don't have to have all these things
[1406.82 → 1411.52] anymore. You just have a phone. This is like, none of these are new marketing points.
[1411.52 → 1418.20] I think this is one of those things where it just happened to land at a moment of high sensitivity
[1418.20 → 1425.18] around this subject. Um, and I think, I think that's actually part of why people were so upset
[1425.18 → 1433.64] about the recent, um, gamer food video as well. So it was right on the heels of one or two high profile
[1433.64 → 1440.54] channels, basically leaving YouTube or paywalling most of their content on their own sites.
[1440.54 → 1444.96] Our gamer food video. Okay. Yeah. So, so we were trying, we've been trying to figure out like
[1444.96 → 1448.26] what happened there and there were definitely some issues in the way that it was messaged
[1448.26 → 1452.62] in the way that it was cut. I did end up watching it and I do agree. Yeah, there were issues,
[1452.62 → 1461.36] but how mad people were like how incredibly angry they were, um, didn't seem to really match,
[1461.36 → 1466.64] um, the, the, the, the sin that we had committed, and we were kind of trying to figure out why it was.
[1466.64 → 1473.52] And it does seem like that was a significant contribution to how upset people were because
[1473.52 → 1478.64] the wounds were a little raw. And I think that's probably what we're seeing right here. We're seeing
[1478.64 → 1486.66] open wounds in the artistic community around computers, replacing human art, but that isn't
[1486.66 → 1494.58] what Apple was trying to say at all. Obviously. Yeah. The iPad has never, even a little bit has
[1494.58 → 1502.62] never been, and it could be with, you know, third party software, you could do generative AI art
[1502.62 → 1510.04] stuff on it, but that's never been Apple's message. Apple has always positioned their professional tools
[1510.04 → 1520.34] as for creators of art. And the fact that they had it taking the place of tools for creators of art
[1520.34 → 1528.32] means that that was the message. These tools, now this tool, and it's so thin. Those other things
[1528.32 → 1533.10] couldn't possibly hope to fit in this hydraulic press. Yeah. And like, this sure does people in
[1533.10 → 1537.78] chat, like Monty Hawk is saying, and copyright is going to be continued to be bypassed by AI with vague
[1537.78 → 1544.32] and hidden BS with more scraping of data and theft. Totally. The ad had literally 0% to do with that.
[1544.60 → 1549.36] That's, that's the this is the thing that we're kind of talking about is like, we think, and I agree
[1549.36 → 1553.78] with Linus, it makes sense. We think there's a lot of rage coming from that area attacking this thing,
[1553.86 → 1558.64] but this thing was saying nothing about AI. It isn't what Apple is trying to say, obviously,
[1558.88 → 1563.08] but it is not tone-deaf to say when that open wound of AI replacing artists is ongoing, but that's the
[1563.08 → 1567.76] thing, right? Like if we know what they're trying to say, and we know that what they're trying
[1567.78 → 1574.28] to say is not the thing that we're upset about, then what's tone-deaf about it? Like is our response
[1574.28 → 1580.90] to them tone-deaf is, is intentionally, if I know what you're trying to say, and I know that it's
[1580.90 → 1587.40] not the thing that's upsetting to me, I'm the one being irrational. Yeah. If I go, well, I'm going to be
[1587.40 → 1594.88] mad anyway. Yeah. Not them. That's not on them. Intentionally misunderstanding someone that's
[1594.90 → 1600.80] up. Don't do that. Yeah. Why would you do that? Even for no other reason than it's just a waste of
[1600.80 → 1606.60] time and energy for yourself. Yeah. Just chill. Why be mad? It's just a it's just some freaking ad.
[1606.60 → 1612.78] There's grass, man. Go touch it. Go touch it. It's okay. Maybe go touch it with a paintbrush.
[1613.78 → 1618.04] You know, there's water, there's water restrictions in place. If you can't water it, if you live
[1618.04 → 1621.28] around here, it's really nice outside these days. Go paint outside. Get some green paint,
[1621.36 → 1627.88] get it on there. Paint your lawn. You go. Took him a while to figure out what I was talking about.
[1627.88 → 1633.44] Oh yeah. I thought you were just like fancily telling people to go touch grass. I didn't
[1633.44 → 1640.10] realize you were like, there's a draw. There's a draw. Go paint your grass green. Oh, sick.
[1640.18 → 1644.02] It's like, wow. Condescending much? Okay. Twitch chat. You lost your chat privileges. Sorry.
[1645.88 → 1648.96] Go paint your employee's car. Exactly.
[1648.96 → 1657.04] Oh man. All right. I think it's one of those things where it's getting worse because the global
[1657.04 → 1662.44] stress levels are so high. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, that's, that's what we're kind of saying. It's
[1662.44 → 1668.22] like, you get that, but just relax. Oh, man. There's so many, there's so many like legitimately scary
[1668.22 → 1674.26] things to be mad about. Oh, yeah. We should legitimately be upset about the whole like AI
[1674.26 → 1678.94] generative, like they took our jobs. There's lots of situations. There are tons of problems.
[1678.96 → 1684.24] That Apple ad just isn't it. Yeah. So why, why invest the energy in it? Save it. It's like
[1684.24 → 1688.64] Hugh Grant, look, no offence, but when's the last time you made a movie that I wouldn't
[1688.64 → 1696.24] just watch on my iPad? Boom. Roasted. Hugh Grant, what does he make? He was actually in
[1696.24 → 1701.42] that Dungeons and Dragons movie. That was very good. Oh, yeah. I legitimately actually, I do
[1701.42 → 1706.48] enjoy Hugh Grant's films. So very recently. Oh, yeah. Oh no, no. I know. I know. Furthermore, I know.
[1706.48 → 1712.94] I was just, no, I was, I was, I was, I was just courting controversy. Oh, this is Hugh
[1712.94 → 1720.82] Grant. Yeah. He's cool. You don't know actors. I don't know anybody. I know. It's sad. Anyway,
[1721.00 → 1726.48] why don't we move on? Microsoft has been catchy. Okay. Okay. Back to things that you should be
[1726.48 → 1733.04] mad about. Here, here is a legitimate, here's a legitimate channel for that energy. This could
[1733.04 → 1738.76] take some action. Microsoft has suddenly closed. It's not an ad. Three studios that it acquired
[1738.76 → 1743.84] alongside Bethesda, including Tango Game works, the developer of the award-winning and widely
[1743.84 → 1752.94] praised Hi-Fi Rush, Arcane. Oh, sorry. Hi-Fi Rush. Uh, oh, how do I pronounce Austin?
[1752.94 → 1760.22] Uh, I think that's supposed to be Austin. Oh, that makes way more sense. Arcane Austin,
[1760.40 → 1764.28] developer of Prey and Red fall was another loss, meaning that development of Red fall...
[1764.28 → 1769.32] It's Arcane Studios in Austin, Texas. Yeah. Is effectively over and its promised DLC has
[1769.32 → 1774.70] been cancelled. Uh, purchasers of the Hero Pass that promised access to this future DLC will
[1774.70 → 1781.58] instead receive a credit of unknown value. Neat. And the studio head at Arcane Austin's sister studio,
[1781.96 → 1788.54] Arcane Leon, called the closure an f***ING gut stab. Uh, fans, meanwhile, have been reverse
[1788.54 → 1794.56] review bombing Hi-Fi Rush with positive reviews in a show of support. According to reporting from
[1794.56 → 1801.04] Bloomberg, even more Microsoft studios are likely to close in the near future due to a widespread
[1801.04 → 1805.88] cost-cutting initiative. There are other reasons as well. Maybe we'll get into them here. I'm not sure.
[1806.00 → 1811.38] During a Bloomberg event, Xbox president Sarah Bond gave a non-answer to whether
[1811.38 → 1816.46] launching a surprise hit game should protect a developer from being shut down, as the camera
[1816.46 → 1824.02] cut to a wide shot showing a very interesting graph of Xbox's year-over-year growth. Here comes
[1824.02 → 1834.36] our very interesting graph. Yeah. All right. Cool. Are you allowed to call it growth? I guess
[1834.36 → 1839.08] growth could be a negative number. That makes sense. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty also
[1839.08 → 1844.82] inflamed the controversy when it was reported that he told employees during an internal meeting
[1844.82 → 1854.16] a day after the closures that Xbox needed smaller games that give us prestige and awards, which is...
[1854.16 → 1862.08] The defence that I've heard around that... Yes. Um, is that Hi-Fi Rush was actually a surprisingly
[1862.08 → 1868.00] large game in the sense of the like, cost of development studio size and stuff like that.
[1868.00 → 1874.50] But I would still argue that it out-preceded expectation. I mean, when we talk about big
[1874.50 → 1881.30] games these days, we're talking about, you know, quadruple-A games. In my mind, honestly,
[1881.42 → 1887.38] though, like, I... When you tell me a big game these days... You try to compare budgets of... So... Yeah, I'm sitting
[1887.38 → 1894.14] here going, okay, well, is it Cyberpunk? You know, is it GTA 6? Like, what's a big game? So when you say
[1894.14 → 1901.82] smaller games... He didn't even say small. Smaller games that give us prestige and awards.
[1902.02 → 1908.48] Yeah, I don't know enough about the size of, like, um, what was it? Was it Arcane... No, Tango Game works.
[1908.64 → 1912.74] I don't know. I don't know anything about the size of that, so I can't really compare it. And the whole
[1912.74 → 1918.30] AAA nomenclature is weird these days anyway, because, like, what does it even mean anymore?
[1918.56 → 1923.32] I heard... I don't remember where I heard this, but I heard that the original naming for that came from,
[1923.32 → 1929.12] like, the finance industry, and it was supposed to essentially define games that were, like,
[1929.14 → 1935.20] a safe investment because they were, like, leaning on IPs that people knew would sell and stuff like
[1935.20 → 1937.68] that, and that's just not what the AAA industry is anymore.
[1937.84 → 1944.88] Here's my question. If they're so strapped for cash, could they have just not bought Bethesda?
[1944.88 → 1947.70] Not bought a bunch of studios? Yeah, I wonder how much...
[1947.70 → 1952.84] Not had a bunch of studios. Could they have just not bought Bethesda, specifically?
[1952.84 → 1957.12] Could they have just not? I wonder how much of this is specifically the failure of Starfield.
[1958.46 → 1961.14] Hmm. That's an interesting question.
[1961.36 → 1965.96] Because, like, I talked about this on the WAN show, I don't know how long ago, but I had a discussion topic.
[1966.16 → 1968.84] I don't know how we got onto this, but I talked about how...
[1969.74 → 1973.78] I think there were some quotes from the director of publishing, from Marian or something in there as well,
[1973.78 → 1983.10] but I talked about how one of the big problems of these subscription services is that the companies running the subscription services
[1983.10 → 1986.92] are just going to want games that sell the subscription service.
[1987.06 → 1993.78] Yep. And they're going to have their own internal metrics, which probably have deeply flawed aspects of them.
[1993.78 → 1995.00] Like, they're not going to be perfect.
[1995.24 → 2000.44] Yep. So they'll do it data-based on whatever, not data-based as in a database.
[2000.72 → 2002.10] Yeah, but based on data.
[2002.10 → 2002.50] Based on data.
[2002.58 → 2003.82] Data-driven decision-making.
[2003.90 → 2004.42] There we go, yeah.
[2004.56 → 2006.74] They'll do that, but then what if the data's junk?
[2006.98 → 2013.28] And I suspect a lot of that data is going to lead them to massive titles that bring in all the people
[2013.28 → 2017.16] instead of these small games that, like, you know, someone might subscribe to the service
[2017.16 → 2019.54] because they're like, oh, I want to play the new Halo or whatever.
[2020.48 → 2023.94] But what they actually spend all their time playing, because Halo sucks now,
[2024.16 → 2027.86] is stuff like Hi-Fi Rush or whatever else.
[2028.14 → 2033.48] But if they, on their exiting survey and the first game they play when they sign up,
[2033.62 → 2036.82] if those aren't these smaller titles, it might not bring light to them.
[2037.22 → 2038.46] And if that makes them think...
[2038.46 → 2039.58] But they should be able to see the playtime, though.
[2039.58 → 2043.28] Yeah, but if you have a bunch of playtime, yeah, I don't know.
[2043.40 → 2045.80] It totally depends on how they're measuring that data.
[2045.80 → 2048.80] It also is...
[2048.80 → 2050.72] I guarantee you...
[2050.72 → 2052.04] Look, I don't work at Microsoft.
[2052.28 → 2053.72] I don't work within the Xbox team.
[2053.78 → 2056.94] But I guarantee you that there's an element of this that's political as well.
[2057.34 → 2061.68] Because any time you just have a bucket of money,
[2062.52 → 2065.34] someone is going to decide what to do with that money.
[2065.54 → 2069.28] If all of these games were selling on their own individual merit,
[2069.28 → 2070.90] generating their own revenue,
[2071.12 → 2075.82] then it would be directly attributable right back to the team that worked on it.
[2076.26 → 2080.34] Whereas if all of these games are minor contributors
[2080.34 → 2085.08] to a gigantic bucket of money called Game Pass revenue,
[2085.48 → 2090.54] that someone or someone's is in charge of divvying up,
[2090.54 → 2094.22] kind of going, okay, so reinvestment-wise,
[2094.52 → 2098.24] this is going to go into what we think is a good bet over here,
[2098.32 → 2101.70] and this is going to go into what we think is a good bet over here,
[2101.70 → 2105.18] just because you made something great last time
[2105.18 → 2108.30] that contributed a bunch of subscribers,
[2108.40 → 2109.44] a bunch of playtime,
[2109.44 → 2113.42] doesn't necessarily mean that you will be divvied anything.
[2113.42 → 2115.72] So it's actually the complete...
[2115.72 → 2116.88] And what's funny is...
[2116.88 → 2120.28] Because what if they don't believe in your vision for your next proposed project?
[2120.66 → 2124.62] Then instead of you just automatically having the money for it anyway,
[2125.02 → 2126.76] because your last project did really well,
[2127.64 → 2129.36] you could just be rug pulled.
[2129.48 → 2130.16] And everything's gone.
[2130.20 → 2132.44] And what's funny about this is I remember us having conversations
[2132.44 → 2137.04] about how subscription services could be a saviour
[2137.04 → 2139.32] for smaller game developers.
[2139.32 → 2140.92] And they could have...
[2140.92 → 2142.70] And it sort of was for a little bit.
[2142.78 → 2143.62] And they could have been,
[2143.70 → 2147.58] because this idea that instead of Feast and Famine,
[2147.60 → 2148.54] where you launch your game,
[2148.76 → 2149.94] you get a bunch of revenue,
[2150.36 → 2156.38] you squirrel it away like a squirrel saving nuts, okay?
[2156.38 → 2157.44] You squirrel it away,
[2157.56 → 2161.38] and then you kind of ration it out
[2161.38 → 2163.34] until you can get your next game launched.
[2164.08 → 2165.88] That wasn't sustainable, right?
[2166.18 → 2168.34] And so the idea that you could just have
[2168.34 → 2171.40] a little bit of consistent revenue trickling in
[2171.40 → 2172.66] on a more regular basis
[2172.66 → 2175.76] by contributing to this pool of games that people can play,
[2175.88 → 2176.90] you know, games Netflix style.
[2177.08 → 2181.90] It all seemed like a pretty happy idea.
[2182.90 → 2185.36] Here's another part of the problem.
[2185.74 → 2187.08] So I don't think this was in the notes,
[2187.28 → 2187.34] but...
[2188.18 → 2190.22] And if I click on the fortune.com article
[2190.22 → 2191.88] to try to actually get the whole thing,
[2192.34 → 2194.62] there's a giant ad that I can't get past
[2194.62 → 2196.12] to pay money to Fortune.
[2196.12 → 2197.68] So I'm just going to read off
[2197.68 → 2199.68] of the Google search result for it.
[2199.68 → 2200.72] But it says,
[2200.88 → 2204.08] speaking about the closures more broadly,
[2204.60 → 2207.10] Booty said that the company's studios
[2207.10 → 2208.62] had been spread too thin,
[2208.80 → 2210.46] like peanut butter on bread,
[2210.52 → 2212.10] which I thought was a really weird analogy
[2212.10 → 2213.42] for spread too thin, but sure.
[2213.78 → 2215.84] And that leaders across the division
[2215.84 → 2217.60] had felt understaffed,
[2217.66 → 2219.52] and they decided to close these studios
[2219.52 → 2220.96] to free up resources elsewhere.
[2220.96 → 2224.34] So they bought all these things.
[2224.76 → 2224.88] Right.
[2225.18 → 2227.40] Didn't have the like,
[2227.46 → 2228.68] high-level leadership
[2228.68 → 2231.00] to manage all these sub-studios now.
[2231.52 → 2232.46] And then we're just like,
[2232.72 → 2234.04] and closed it.
[2237.70 → 2238.82] What a waste.
[2239.08 → 2239.86] Like, there's, like,
[2239.98 → 2241.30] Embracer Group just, like,
[2241.36 → 2242.12] bought a bunch of stuff
[2242.12 → 2242.98] and then closed them.
[2243.02 → 2244.46] And Microsoft just bought a bunch of stuff
[2244.46 → 2245.10] and closed them.
[2245.26 → 2246.60] Like, this isn't going to make people
[2246.60 → 2248.90] get interested in your other garbage games
[2248.90 → 2249.48] that you're releasing.
[2249.48 → 2251.06] It's just going to create
[2251.06 → 2254.44] more people buying other stuff
[2254.44 → 2255.46] unrelated to you.
[2255.82 → 2257.24] Like, if we look at a lot of
[2257.24 → 2259.22] the huge successes as to late,
[2259.40 → 2260.50] they have not been
[2260.50 → 2262.90] big Microsoft titles.
[2263.32 → 2264.46] What about Halo Infinite?
[2265.46 → 2266.64] It's just not working.
[2267.24 → 2269.66] Like, the buy them and close them model
[2269.66 → 2271.12] is not going to be effective.
[2271.28 → 2272.04] I pretty much guarantee.
[2272.06 → 2273.98] And I just, I have to kind of wonder,
[2274.46 → 2276.28] right, like bean counters, you know?
[2276.28 → 2280.26] If you, if you're bean counting
[2280.26 → 2281.72] calculation goes,
[2281.84 → 2283.90] okay, this bean costs
[2283.90 → 2285.98] one billion dollars.
[2286.58 → 2287.10] Okay.
[2287.78 → 2290.12] Um, so you buy it for
[2290.12 → 2291.54] a billion dollars.
[2291.98 → 2292.16] Nice.
[2292.24 → 2293.86] And then you basically go,
[2294.00 → 2294.24] okay.
[2294.72 → 2296.14] It's a solid bean right there.
[2296.34 → 2296.68] Okay.
[2297.30 → 2299.16] Let's throw away this bean.
[2299.76 → 2301.04] I could fit so much fibre
[2301.04 → 2301.58] in that bean.
[2301.74 → 2301.96] Yeah.
[2301.96 → 2304.24] Um, what's your plan?
[2305.06 → 2305.90] Like, how did that,
[2305.98 → 2307.20] how did that make it past?
[2307.42 → 2308.94] How did that make it past the
[2309.04 → 2309.36] you know that,
[2309.42 → 2310.68] you know that old meme format
[2310.68 → 2311.84] where the guy gets like
[2311.84 → 2312.84] sucked out of the window
[2312.84 → 2313.82] of the boardroom?
[2313.94 → 2314.32] Like how?
[2314.90 → 2316.14] How did it make it past that guy?
[2316.34 → 2316.62] Yeah.
[2317.18 → 2317.48] Yeah.
[2317.60 → 2319.34] I, I, I actually don't get it.
[2319.40 → 2320.44] And to, and to be clear,
[2320.92 → 2321.52] um, you know,
[2321.54 → 2323.02] it's not like as a company,
[2323.02 → 2325.48] we've never over extended ourselves
[2325.48 → 2327.04] and, and been in a position
[2327.04 → 2328.16] where, you know,
[2328.34 → 2329.90] having twice as many people are,
[2329.90 → 2331.36] is, you know,
[2331.66 → 2333.46] actually less efficient, right?
[2333.48 → 2333.82] Like it's,
[2333.86 → 2335.74] it's not like we aren't at a size
[2335.74 → 2337.00] where I get that.
[2337.12 → 2337.86] Growth has pains.
[2338.52 → 2342.20] But you don't have to buy things.
[2342.30 → 2343.04] And they did it.
[2343.06 → 2344.16] They closed it so fast.
[2344.92 → 2346.78] They didn't buy Bethesda that long ago.
[2347.12 → 2347.44] No.
[2347.84 → 2349.34] Like it's very quickly.
[2349.62 → 2349.96] No.
[2351.18 → 2352.06] My goodness.
[2352.76 → 2353.60] Oh man.
[2353.74 → 2354.72] But throwing away the bean
[2354.72 → 2355.62] is a tax write-off.
[2355.62 → 2356.90] Drop table employees
[2356.90 → 2357.78] in float plane chat,
[2357.84 → 2358.24] you're banned.
[2358.24 → 2359.90] I'm kidding.
[2360.00 → 2360.30] I'm kidding.
[2360.38 → 2361.82] I do wonder like how much,
[2362.02 → 2364.26] like how much of this is just like stock,
[2365.66 → 2367.40] like minor stock manipulation
[2367.40 → 2370.42] or, or like trying to appease stockholders at all.
[2370.64 → 2371.62] Like, well, because if they,
[2371.66 → 2373.60] if they, if they have all these studios,
[2373.60 → 2375.36] like, is it,
[2375.44 → 2379.24] is it better from a stockholders' perspective
[2379.24 → 2381.76] or someone potentially purchasing a stock?
[2381.90 → 2383.48] This is stuff I am not good at.
[2383.52 → 2384.24] Don't know a lot about.
[2384.24 → 2385.64] So just big warning
[2385.64 → 2386.66] before people get pissed off.
[2386.66 → 2389.00] Um, from, from that perspective,
[2389.00 → 2390.10] is it better for them
[2390.10 → 2393.56] to just focus on future revenue
[2393.56 → 2395.44] than care about what's in the bank right now?
[2395.46 → 2396.18] And I think yes.
[2396.18 → 2396.44] Right.
[2396.56 → 2398.16] So they can spend fairly recklessly
[2398.16 → 2399.42] to like buy studios
[2399.42 → 2401.14] as long as they're sharpening the sword
[2401.14 → 2401.70] for the future.
[2401.70 → 2403.02] Is that, is that how the like
[2403.02 → 2406.10] capitalist stock market perspective goes?
[2406.10 → 2407.08] So what you want,
[2407.14 → 2409.04] if you are an acquisition company,
[2409.04 → 2410.70] which at a certain point,
[2410.70 → 2412.80] they are every company is,
[2412.84 → 2414.10] you're essentially just,
[2414.10 → 2417.30] what, when's the last time Microsoft invented anything?
[2418.14 → 2419.82] And you can basically say that
[2419.82 → 2423.00] about any gigantic multi hundreds
[2423.00 → 2424.96] of billions of dollars company.
[2425.20 → 2426.46] Some of them do.
[2426.58 → 2427.54] They just buy small companies.
[2427.54 → 2429.70] They do very real research and development,
[2429.70 → 2431.48] but a lot of the time they're just,
[2431.60 → 2432.78] they're out there acquiring.
[2432.92 → 2433.72] They buy open AI.
[2434.00 → 2434.90] They're acquiring,
[2435.00 → 2435.46] they're acquiring,
[2435.54 → 2436.04] they're acquiring.
[2436.04 → 2437.84] So at a certain level,
[2438.08 → 2439.18] pretty much every company
[2439.18 → 2441.02] is an acquisition company.
[2441.12 → 2443.48] So they take capital from shareholders,
[2443.80 → 2444.52] from investors,
[2444.52 → 2447.92] and they use that capital to buy something
[2447.92 → 2450.00] that has recurring revenue.
[2450.28 → 2453.22] Then they basically just need to maintain
[2453.22 → 2455.08] whatever their target balance
[2455.08 → 2459.44] of revenue to operational expenses is.
[2460.08 → 2462.04] And if they don't,
[2462.28 → 2463.88] then their share price crashes,
[2463.88 → 2465.76] their credit worthiness tanks,
[2466.04 → 2467.80] and they are in enormous trouble
[2467.80 → 2470.70] because they have a bunch of debt, right?
[2470.94 → 2473.56] Because they needed that investment
[2473.56 → 2475.98] in order to make those acquisitions.
[2476.32 → 2476.38] Yeah.
[2476.50 → 2477.78] So it becomes this,
[2477.86 → 2480.46] it becomes this wheel
[2480.46 → 2482.46] that they have to keep running on
[2482.46 → 2484.62] to constantly show
[2484.62 → 2487.52] a really high operating income,
[2488.00 → 2488.62] which is that,
[2488.62 → 2491.08] which is that operating revenue
[2491.08 → 2495.02] minus operational expenses calculation.
[2495.02 → 2497.76] And so what they might do
[2497.76 → 2500.04] is bought something,
[2500.04 → 2502.20] and then if it doesn't immediately
[2502.20 → 2504.62] spin the money machine fast enough
[2504.62 → 2506.14] by shedding it,
[2506.78 → 2508.66] well, a penny saved
[2508.66 → 2510.58] is a penny earned.
[2510.92 → 2511.02] Yeah.
[2511.24 → 2513.56] And from an investor standpoint,
[2514.24 → 2516.18] the minor details,
[2516.54 → 2517.94] like the amount of money
[2517.94 → 2518.90] that they had to spend
[2518.90 → 2520.64] to reach that number
[2520.64 → 2521.78] on a quarter by quarter
[2521.78 → 2523.18] by quarter basis,
[2523.18 → 2524.60] doesn't really matter
[2524.60 → 2526.08] as long as they find
[2526.08 → 2527.94] some other thing to acquire
[2527.94 → 2529.24] that like does better
[2529.24 → 2530.06] or some other thing
[2530.06 → 2530.96] that, you know,
[2530.96 → 2531.38] does whatever.
[2531.52 → 2533.16] It's just effectively
[2533.16 → 2534.84] cost of doing business.
[2534.84 → 2536.46] There is no human element
[2536.46 → 2537.54] to any of this.
[2538.62 → 2539.80] And that's why
[2539.80 → 2541.02] you see decisions
[2541.02 → 2542.06] like this being made.
[2542.12 → 2542.80] That's why
[2542.80 → 2544.14] you see this level
[2544.14 → 2545.14] of recklessness
[2545.14 → 2547.52] or callousness,
[2547.58 → 2547.86] I guess,
[2547.92 → 2549.34] is probably the better word.
[2550.00 → 2551.32] The example of Tesla
[2551.32 → 2552.60] just laying off
[2552.60 → 2553.62] their supercharging team.
[2553.62 → 2553.82] Does that change though
[2553.82 → 2555.58] because they bought Bethesda
[2555.58 → 2556.78] for like around 10%
[2556.78 → 2557.98] of just the cash on hand
[2557.98 → 2558.52] that they had?
[2558.70 → 2559.42] So I don't know.
[2559.60 → 2559.84] I mean,
[2559.84 → 2560.98] it was probably still done
[2560.98 → 2562.26] as some debt purchase
[2562.26 → 2563.28] because whatever,
[2563.52 → 2564.14] but...
[2564.14 → 2567.82] I guess what I'm trying to say
[2567.82 → 2569.98] is that immediate loss
[2569.98 → 2570.92] on Bethesda
[2570.92 → 2572.36] doesn't really matter
[2572.36 → 2573.76] as long as they maintain
[2573.76 → 2574.50] that ratio.
[2574.64 → 2575.92] This is what I was trying.
[2576.08 → 2577.42] This was also the point
[2577.42 → 2578.36] that I was effectively trying.
[2578.36 → 2578.90] Oh, I see.
[2579.02 → 2580.04] Like does spend the money
[2580.04 → 2581.20] effectively not matter?
[2581.38 → 2582.46] And then they try to sharpen
[2582.46 → 2583.26] the sword afterwards.
[2583.50 → 2585.06] So like the purchase of studios
[2585.06 → 2586.20] from these large companies
[2586.20 → 2589.28] means honestly next to nothing.
[2589.52 → 2589.72] Yeah.
[2589.72 → 2591.72] Like it's...
[2591.72 → 2593.98] And they can play
[2593.98 → 2596.04] an extremely long game
[2596.04 → 2598.86] as long as they don't run out of capital.
[2599.08 → 2600.74] Like I think I've talked about this before,
[2600.84 → 2601.86] but one of my friends
[2601.86 → 2604.68] has an independently owned
[2604.68 → 2605.64] veterinary practice.
[2606.70 → 2609.02] And she was talking to me
[2609.02 → 2611.22] about the nightmare that it was
[2611.22 → 2612.80] to be bidding
[2612.80 → 2614.62] on the veterinary practice
[2614.62 → 2615.36] that she worked at.
[2615.42 → 2616.12] So she worked there.
[2616.22 → 2617.58] She started as an employee
[2617.58 → 2619.26] and is now the owner.
[2619.26 → 2620.62] But her journey there
[2620.62 → 2622.08] was arduous.
[2623.60 → 2625.68] And as she was reaching
[2625.68 → 2626.74] the final stages
[2626.74 → 2628.68] of her negotiation
[2628.68 → 2629.92] to purchase
[2629.92 → 2631.20] the veterinary practice,
[2631.80 → 2633.70] the problem was that
[2633.70 → 2635.00] she was bidding against
[2635.00 → 2636.26] a large...
[2636.90 → 2637.70] You could call them
[2637.70 → 2638.80] a veterinary company,
[2639.00 → 2640.58] but remember what I just said.
[2640.96 → 2641.64] Any company,
[2641.88 → 2642.68] once it's large enough,
[2642.80 → 2644.34] is just an acquisition company.
[2644.44 → 2645.46] So what they really are
[2645.46 → 2646.68] are an acquisition
[2646.68 → 2647.80] and holding company
[2647.80 → 2649.84] that happens to focus
[2649.84 → 2650.58] on investments
[2650.58 → 2651.94] into veterinary practices
[2651.94 → 2652.88] because it's a space
[2652.88 → 2654.34] that they are deeply invested in,
[2654.44 → 2655.34] which can come
[2655.34 → 2656.54] with strategic advantages,
[2656.54 → 2657.86] which I'll get to in a second.
[2658.30 → 2659.10] And so the problem
[2659.10 → 2659.72] that she had
[2659.72 → 2660.42] was typically
[2660.42 → 2661.22] you would value
[2661.22 → 2662.08] a business on
[2662.08 → 2663.10] some multiple
[2663.10 → 2664.64] of their earnings
[2664.64 → 2666.76] before something,
[2666.96 → 2667.34] something,
[2667.44 → 2667.76] I forget,
[2667.84 → 2668.02] whatever.
[2668.14 → 2668.78] It's called EBITDA.
[2668.78 → 2670.06] So, you know,
[2670.12 → 2672.60] let's say 3 to 5x
[2672.60 → 2673.56] for a business
[2673.56 → 2674.46] that's not expected
[2674.46 → 2675.12] to experience
[2675.12 → 2676.66] any kind of explosive growth.
[2676.74 → 2678.24] And what that essentially means
[2678.24 → 2679.22] is let's say that number
[2679.22 → 2679.96] was $10 million.
[2680.84 → 2681.92] I would expect
[2681.92 → 2682.46] to buy
[2682.46 → 2684.86] your veterinary practice
[2684.86 → 2685.92] that makes
[2685.92 → 2688.52] $2 million a year.
[2688.72 → 2689.30] I would expect
[2689.30 → 2689.82] to buy it
[2689.82 → 2690.44] for somewhere between
[2690.44 → 2691.40] $6 and $10 million.
[2691.94 → 2692.90] And the idea
[2692.90 → 2694.24] is that if I continue
[2694.24 → 2695.20] to run it well,
[2695.20 → 2696.98] I will make back
[2696.98 → 2698.46] my $6 to $10 million
[2698.46 → 2700.44] in 3 to 5 years.
[2700.48 → 2701.22] And if it's a business
[2701.22 → 2702.44] that's expected to grow,
[2702.70 → 2703.56] then you would expect
[2703.56 → 2704.58] a higher multiplier
[2704.58 → 2706.50] because if I run it competently,
[2706.60 → 2707.40] well, it should grow
[2707.40 → 2709.42] and I should make my money back
[2709.42 → 2710.98] in an even shorter period of time.
[2711.00 → 2711.64] And you can see
[2711.64 → 2714.58] much, much higher EBITDA
[2714.58 → 2716.08] in fields like tech
[2716.08 → 2717.06] where they're expecting
[2717.06 → 2717.56] this company
[2717.56 → 2719.38] to explosively grow
[2719.38 → 2720.80] in the next two years
[2720.80 → 2721.32] to the point
[2721.32 → 2722.02] where they might get
[2722.02 → 2722.88] that return in,
[2722.98 → 2723.30] you know,
[2723.36 → 2724.38] 18 months, right?
[2725.20 → 2726.50] Well, a veterinary practice
[2726.50 → 2727.28] isn't like that.
[2727.60 → 2728.70] You know, they're...
[2728.70 → 2729.36] It's probably going
[2729.36 → 2730.04] to be pretty consistent.
[2730.58 → 2731.94] You might see...
[2731.94 → 2733.62] You might see steady growth.
[2733.64 → 2735.18] Unless everyone buys pets
[2735.18 → 2735.88] because of COVID
[2735.88 → 2736.98] or something like that,
[2737.04 → 2737.78] there's no way
[2737.78 → 2738.36] you can see it coming.
[2738.42 → 2739.66] But there's only so many...
[2739.66 → 2740.82] There's only so many
[2740.82 → 2741.98] operating rooms.
[2742.58 → 2742.82] You know,
[2742.88 → 2743.72] there's only so many
[2743.72 → 2745.16] dogs you can cut open
[2745.16 → 2745.68] at a time.
[2746.54 → 2749.88] And so there's kind of limits.
[2750.18 → 2750.50] Sad but true.
[2750.62 → 2750.88] Yes.
[2750.94 → 2751.68] There's kind of limits
[2751.68 → 2753.70] to how much it can grow.
[2753.70 → 2754.02] Yeah.
[2754.02 → 2755.08] And so, you know,
[2755.14 → 2759.68] somewhere in the 3 to 4 to 5x range
[2759.68 → 2760.78] is probably reasonable
[2760.78 → 2761.74] for something like that.
[2762.06 → 2763.84] But what she was up against
[2763.84 → 2764.74] was a company
[2764.74 → 2765.90] that was bidding
[2765.90 → 2766.98] about double that.
[2768.18 → 2770.98] And she's looking at it going,
[2771.28 → 2773.96] this makes no real sense.
[2774.66 → 2777.76] Like, the cost.
[2777.76 → 2780.42] Like, I have to have debt
[2780.42 → 2781.64] in order to...
[2781.64 → 2783.04] I don't have that kind of money
[2783.04 → 2783.96] sitting in the bank.
[2784.08 → 2785.32] It's millions of dollars.
[2785.64 → 2786.84] Even a vet, right?
[2786.92 → 2788.74] They don't have millions of dollars
[2788.74 → 2789.46] of cash in the bank.
[2789.48 → 2790.42] It doesn't work like that.
[2790.48 → 2791.20] Like, you have to...
[2791.20 → 2792.58] You have to take on debt
[2792.58 → 2793.24] in order to make
[2793.24 → 2794.46] an acquisition like that.
[2795.34 → 2795.70] And...
[2795.70 → 2797.86] So how does this make any sense?
[2797.92 → 2798.76] The amount of interest
[2798.76 → 2799.52] I'm going to be paying...
[2800.72 → 2801.06] Right.
[2801.24 → 2801.70] So...
[2801.70 → 2803.14] But she's up against a group
[2803.14 → 2803.74] that is playing
[2803.74 → 2806.20] such a long, long game.
[2806.28 → 2807.08] They just don't even care.
[2807.18 → 2808.38] They don't care
[2808.38 → 2810.00] about the immediate return.
[2810.00 → 2810.46] They want effectively
[2810.46 → 2810.74] monopolistic ownership
[2810.74 → 2812.16] of all the veterinary practices
[2812.16 → 2813.96] in the general areas
[2813.96 → 2814.92] that they're operating in.
[2814.92 → 2816.58] They're playing such a long game
[2816.58 → 2818.22] and their shareholders
[2818.22 → 2819.62] don't care
[2819.62 → 2821.32] about that big hit
[2821.32 → 2822.16] to the balance sheet
[2822.16 → 2822.70] this quarter.
[2822.98 → 2824.32] What they care about
[2824.32 → 2826.92] is the money machine...
[2826.92 → 2827.58] What's the path?
[2827.74 → 2828.52] ...churning out
[2828.52 → 2830.52] consistent income.
[2830.84 → 2832.50] And then once there's
[2832.50 → 2833.72] nothing else to acquire,
[2833.74 → 2834.86] well, they still have
[2834.86 → 2836.00] to have that go up.
[2836.14 → 2837.22] So what they do is,
[2837.38 → 2838.58] well, now that they control
[2838.58 → 2839.86] all the veterinary practices
[2839.86 → 2841.02] in the Vancouver area,
[2841.16 → 2842.88] they jack up the prices.
[2843.68 → 2845.20] And that's the end game.
[2845.64 → 2848.04] It destroys everything.
[2848.52 → 2850.18] And the reality of it is
[2850.18 → 2850.92] that regulators
[2850.92 → 2852.32] are not going to get involved
[2852.32 → 2854.76] in community veterinary practices.
[2855.42 → 2857.38] Because it's not a monopoly
[2857.38 → 2861.18] in the strictest sense of the word.
[2861.90 → 2863.60] It's anti-competitive, sure.
[2864.22 → 2865.82] But, I mean, realistically,
[2866.02 → 2866.64] when there are
[2866.64 → 2868.30] so much bigger battles
[2868.30 → 2868.84] to fight,
[2869.16 → 2869.74] like, you know,
[2869.78 → 2871.32] the $400 band-aid
[2871.32 → 2872.10] that might end up
[2872.10 → 2872.80] on your invoice
[2872.80 → 2874.68] at a hospital, for example.
[2876.16 → 2876.60] What?
[2876.74 → 2877.16] So, like,
[2877.22 → 2878.76] your dog's broken leg
[2878.76 → 2880.06] costs you more
[2880.06 → 2880.96] because some company
[2880.96 → 2881.74] owns all the vet legs?
[2882.06 → 2882.68] I'm sorry,
[2882.76 → 2883.32] I don't have time for this.
[2883.32 → 2883.70] I think it's something
[2883.70 → 2884.38] that would be nice
[2884.38 → 2885.02] if they pursued.
[2885.16 → 2885.72] And I'm happy
[2885.72 → 2886.42] that these days
[2886.42 → 2887.62] they do seem to be doing
[2887.62 → 2888.96] roughly anything.
[2888.96 → 2889.68] Um,
[2890.44 → 2891.38] but, yeah,
[2891.56 → 2892.50] there might be bigger fish.
[2893.28 → 2894.58] So, I, um,
[2894.78 → 2895.54] so, so basically,
[2895.68 → 2895.84] yeah,
[2895.90 → 2896.50] that's the
[2896.64 → 2897.92] that's the long and short of it.
[2898.04 → 2899.02] They don't care
[2899.02 → 2901.42] because they don't care.
[2901.78 → 2902.12] They don't need to.
[2902.12 → 2903.50] Because it just doesn't
[2903.50 → 2904.54] matter to them.
[2905.28 → 2905.72] Um,
[2906.24 → 2907.62] which really sucks.
[2909.62 → 2909.98] Uh, well,
[2910.20 → 2910.66] so the
[2910.66 → 2911.36] the good news
[2911.36 → 2912.56] for my friend
[2912.56 → 2912.90] who,
[2913.02 → 2914.46] who owns the practice
[2914.46 → 2916.02] is that Dr. Smith
[2916.02 → 2918.12] is a good guy.
[2918.18 → 2919.02] One of those people
[2919.02 → 2919.80] who actually
[2919.80 → 2921.08] puts people
[2921.08 → 2922.28] above money
[2922.28 → 2923.90] and, uh,
[2924.02 → 2924.68] and took,
[2925.42 → 2926.22] took the
[2926.40 → 2928.16] took the human offer.
[2928.44 → 2928.92] That's cool.
[2929.12 → 2929.28] Yeah.
[2929.34 → 2930.26] That's actually perfect to know.
[2930.26 → 2930.38] Yeah.
[2930.48 → 2931.08] So, uh,
[2931.08 → 2932.00] if you guys are ever,
[2932.12 → 2933.00] ever need,
[2933.14 → 2934.10] need help with,
[2934.24 → 2934.48] uh,
[2934.48 → 2934.84] and don't,
[2934.92 → 2935.84] don't assume most people
[2935.84 → 2936.62] are going to do that either.
[2936.74 → 2937.22] No, most people.
[2937.22 → 2937.98] Most people would take
[2937.98 → 2938.54] the big offer.
[2938.62 → 2938.82] And,
[2938.92 → 2940.08] and you can tell yourself
[2940.08 → 2940.78] all day.
[2941.16 → 2942.16] You can tell yourself
[2942.16 → 2943.14] all day and night.
[2943.50 → 2944.12] I would take it.
[2944.18 → 2945.34] I would take the human offer.
[2945.40 → 2945.58] I would.
[2945.58 → 2946.04] And then the offer's
[2946.04 → 2946.56] on the table.
[2946.64 → 2946.96] And then,
[2947.04 → 2948.62] and then there's literally
[2948.62 → 2949.72] millions of dollars.
[2949.72 → 2950.90] Millions of dollars at stake.
[2950.98 → 2951.76] It's in front of you.
[2951.84 → 2952.98] The document is there.
[2953.20 → 2953.86] All you have to do
[2953.86 → 2954.42] is sign it.
[2954.64 → 2955.36] Pretty much no one's
[2955.36 → 2955.62] going to know
[2955.62 → 2956.30] that you did this.
[2956.58 → 2957.96] Most people will sign it.
[2958.18 → 2958.36] Yep.
[2958.62 → 2958.98] Um,
[2958.98 → 2959.62] but it was,
[2959.68 → 2959.86] uh,
[2959.86 → 2960.78] it was pretty cool.
[2960.94 → 2962.16] So Dr. Smith,
[2962.62 → 2963.40] super cool.
[2963.96 → 2964.06] And,
[2964.16 → 2964.48] um,
[2964.64 → 2964.82] yeah,
[2964.84 → 2965.00] yeah.
[2965.00 → 2965.56] Shout out,
[2965.70 → 2966.76] shout out my friend Cindy
[2966.76 → 2968.40] from Fraser Heights Animal Hospital.
[2968.96 → 2969.40] Um,
[2969.42 → 2969.80] really,
[2969.96 → 2970.64] perfect,
[2971.16 → 2971.88] good person.
[2972.46 → 2972.90] Um,
[2973.50 → 2973.74] yeah,
[2974.40 → 2974.68] she's,
[2974.74 → 2975.36] she's super cool.
[2975.36 → 2976.12] So if you guys,
[2976.32 → 2976.94] I don't think they,
[2977.12 → 2977.90] they don't do birds,
[2977.96 → 2979.22] unfortunately for Luke.
[2979.22 → 2979.58] Yeah.
[2979.76 → 2980.08] Um,
[2980.08 → 2981.32] they specialize in dogs and cats,
[2981.48 → 2982.86] but our vet is actually,
[2983.14 → 2983.30] they're,
[2983.34 → 2984.20] they're very nice people.
[2984.44 → 2985.64] They're just really far away.
[2987.26 → 2988.62] That's the main annoying part.
[2989.86 → 2990.58] Um,
[2991.30 → 2993.44] we're supposed to explain and do two merch messages.
[2994.14 → 2994.74] Shall we?
[2995.04 → 2995.40] Yeah.
[2997.64 → 2998.56] You want me to do it?
[2998.58 → 2998.70] Yeah,
[2998.74 → 2999.52] why don't you do it for a change?
[2999.52 → 2999.82] You always do it.
[2999.94 → 3000.18] I know.
[3000.44 → 3004.24] Merch messages are the premier way of sending messages into show,
[3004.36 → 3004.88] into the show.
[3004.88 → 3005.20] I like that.
[3005.28 → 3007.58] There are others, and they are inferior.
[3007.84 → 3008.92] This is the way to do it.
[3008.98 → 3010.32] You get stuff.
[3010.50 → 3011.66] Could you buy a gift card?
[3011.80 → 3012.08] Yes.
[3012.10 → 3013.46] If you really just wanted nothing,
[3013.46 → 3015.42] but you should probably,
[3015.60 → 3015.72] you know,
[3015.72 → 3017.10] get something for your,
[3017.10 → 3017.36] your,
[3017.36 → 3020.12] your message that you choose to send into the store.
[3020.24 → 3020.52] Yeah.
[3020.58 → 3021.84] If you choose to do so,
[3021.88 → 3022.92] you can go onto the store,
[3023.28 → 3023.90] pick an item,
[3024.18 → 3025.30] add it to your cart,
[3025.62 → 3026.64] view your cart.
[3027.32 → 3028.90] And there you go.
[3029.16 → 3030.28] On the cart page,
[3030.60 → 3031.86] you can see the merch message.
[3031.98 → 3033.04] You can check the little box.
[3033.10 → 3036.14] I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message on the LTT stream.
[3036.40 → 3038.60] And then leave whatever message you want to leave.
[3038.68 → 3039.76] You can pick your little colour.
[3040.02 → 3042.08] You can do all that type of stuff.
[3042.42 → 3043.76] You can make it anonymous if you want,
[3044.04 → 3044.36] et cetera.
[3044.88 → 3046.66] And then either,
[3046.84 → 3047.50] uh,
[3047.50 → 3050.70] you'll say bad things that we don't want to show up on the show, and we'll hide
[3050.70 → 3052.10] it, and it will never be shown to anyone.
[3052.48 → 3052.84] Uh,
[3052.84 → 3055.12] or Dan will read it and go like,
[3055.18 → 3056.14] I can respond to that.
[3056.20 → 3057.96] And he'll respond to it through text.
[3058.02 → 3061.02] And then it will show up at the bottom of the screen where this banner
[3061.02 → 3061.66] currently is.
[3061.68 → 3062.60] It'll show your message.
[3062.60 → 3064.92] And then it will show Dan's response or one of the
[3065.12 → 3065.40] uh,
[3065.40 → 3069.48] or Linus or myself will do a text response, or it will be selected as a
[3069.48 → 3074.98] discussion question for Linus and I and Dan potentially to discuss live on
[3074.98 → 3075.58] the show.
[3075.88 → 3077.58] Dark 24 on float plane says,
[3077.82 → 3078.44] I hate stuff.
[3078.52 → 3079.86] I just want to buy words.
[3080.16 → 3080.40] Hey,
[3080.62 → 3081.32] good news.
[3081.64 → 3083.28] You're subscribed to float plane.
[3083.46 → 3083.60] Yeah,
[3083.62 → 3084.18] you did it.
[3084.48 → 3085.28] Good job.
[3085.32 → 3085.96] You succeeded.
[3086.96 → 3087.80] You found,
[3087.90 → 3090.90] you found the place where we will take your money to have,
[3090.90 → 3092.04] to have colourful,
[3092.54 → 3092.94] colourful,
[3093.20 → 3094.56] your name in colourful words.
[3094.56 → 3095.26] Um,
[3095.26 → 3095.66] yeah.
[3096.16 → 3096.54] Oh,
[3096.56 → 3097.04] and also,
[3097.14 → 3097.36] you know,
[3097.40 → 3098.96] behind the scenes and all that kind of cool stuff.
[3099.20 → 3099.38] Uh,
[3099.38 → 3100.88] we do have some updates on the store.
[3101.02 → 3102.28] So we finally,
[3102.76 → 3107.34] finally brought back some of our classic t-shirts,
[3107.34 → 3108.28] Ram,
[3108.42 → 3109.04] hard drive,
[3109.18 → 3109.72] processor,
[3109.90 → 3112.82] and GPU are all back.
[3112.90 → 3113.38] That's right.
[3113.42 → 3115.50] My friends processor shirt is so sick.
[3115.50 → 3117.62] We even retook photos.
[3117.76 → 3119.14] And this is hilarious.
[3119.46 → 3119.74] Uh,
[3119.74 → 3121.16] Maria sent me this,
[3121.16 → 3121.66] uh,
[3121.66 → 3122.56] earlier today.
[3122.74 → 3123.62] She was like,
[3123.76 → 3124.02] dude,
[3124.02 → 3125.68] I don't know how you did this,
[3125.68 → 3127.14] but exactly the same,
[3127.28 → 3130.90] but your picture looks exactly the same.
[3130.98 → 3131.12] Oh,
[3131.12 → 3131.42] okay.
[3131.54 → 3133.42] This goes to the same one every time.
[3133.48 → 3133.64] Okay.
[3133.64 → 3133.90] Hold on.
[3134.00 → 3134.76] I'll get this.
[3138.96 → 3140.22] This man has practice.
[3140.72 → 3140.86] Yeah.
[3140.90 → 3141.16] Your,
[3141.22 → 3142.98] your hands are in slightly different positions,
[3143.08 → 3143.96] but they're very similar.
[3144.02 → 3144.70] She was like,
[3145.22 → 3145.72] dude,
[3145.90 → 3146.22] wow.
[3146.34 → 3146.62] What?
[3146.92 → 3147.16] The
[3147.16 → 3147.58] the
[3147.58 → 3149.72] the head is like identical.
[3149.90 → 3150.22] This is,
[3150.32 → 3151.74] this is not like Photoshop.
[3152.04 → 3152.94] These are not two set.
[3153.08 → 3153.66] These are,
[3153.82 → 3159.98] these are two completely different pictures taken like a couple of minutes apart where I walked off.
[3159.98 → 3161.08] I walked off the
[3161.08 → 3162.22] the photo set,
[3162.50 → 3163.90] changed my shirt,
[3164.40 → 3165.02] walked back,
[3165.24 → 3165.80] stood there,
[3165.80 → 3168.74] and absolutely nailed it.
[3169.12 → 3169.94] That's awesome.
[3171.58 → 3172.26] So yeah.
[3172.62 → 3172.82] Oh,
[3172.96 → 3173.30] get over.
[3173.38 → 3174.60] Elijah is breaking news.
[3174.68 → 3175.44] Linus looks like Linus.
[3175.52 → 3176.18] That's not the point.
[3176.26 → 3176.66] Elijah.
[3178.20 → 3179.00] Xavier says,
[3179.00 → 3179.82] same pose.
[3180.02 → 3182.16] Xavier says the wrinkles are different.
[3183.02 → 3183.96] My goodness.
[3184.52 → 3185.18] In the shirt.
[3185.36 → 3187.80] The shirt wrinkles are that didn't like the Apple ad.
[3187.88 → 3188.94] The shirt wrinkles are different.
[3188.94 → 3190.54] I know what they meant.
[3190.92 → 3192.34] It wasn't the shirt wrinkles.
[3193.24 → 3194.40] It was the real ones.
[3194.48 → 3195.72] Don't make me go get more procedures.
[3196.76 → 3197.68] Oh my goodness.
[3198.50 → 3198.88] No,
[3198.92 → 3199.18] I'm done.
[3200.96 → 3201.40] Um,
[3201.44 → 3201.68] all right.
[3201.72 → 3202.72] Actual merge message time.
[3203.34 → 3204.08] Dan hit us.
[3204.22 → 3204.46] Yeah,
[3204.72 → 3204.96] sure.
[3205.58 → 3205.86] Hey,
[3206.00 → 3206.34] wait,
[3206.44 → 3206.78] hold on.
[3206.84 → 3207.44] There are a few notes.
[3207.54 → 3208.30] There are a few notes.
[3208.60 → 3211.40] These are printed on our old American Apparel blanks,
[3211.44 → 3211.80] apparently.
[3212.08 → 3212.28] Oh,
[3212.32 → 3212.48] what?
[3212.70 → 3214.96] And the hard drive and Ram shirts are still being printed.
[3215.06 → 3216.60] So shipping for those will be a little bit delayed.
[3216.76 → 3217.68] Limited quantities available.
[3217.68 → 3218.04] Oh,
[3218.12 → 3218.50] I see.
[3218.58 → 3222.22] So we're just blowing away some leftover American Apparel shirt stock.
[3222.30 → 3222.50] Okay,
[3222.62 → 3222.82] cool.
[3222.98 → 3223.18] I mean,
[3223.24 → 3224.04] the American Apparel shirts,
[3224.24 → 3226.86] they were good enough for us to sell for many years.
[3227.34 → 3227.76] Good shirts.
[3228.32 → 3230.10] I do like our new ones better,
[3230.22 → 3230.74] but yeah,
[3230.84 → 3231.12] but Hey,
[3231.66 → 3232.30] but they're good shirts.
[3232.36 → 3232.94] Classic designs.
[3233.02 → 3233.32] Let's go.
[3233.76 → 3233.88] Hey,
[3233.96 → 3234.10] sorry.
[3234.16 → 3234.40] Go ahead.
[3234.78 → 3235.02] Hey,
[3235.14 → 3237.04] lentil lungs and door.
[3237.04 → 3238.60] I've noticed that the last few,
[3238.68 → 3239.46] these are getting really weird.
[3239.80 → 3244.12] I've noticed that the last few handheld PC videos haven't mentioned the Steam Deck much.
[3244.56 → 3248.48] Is that because it's not a good comparison because of price or performance?
[3248.60 → 3251.28] What it isn't is an apples to apples comparison.
[3251.44 → 3254.34] The Steam Deck is an incredible console,
[3254.84 → 3259.38] but for the same reason that I wouldn't necessarily talk about the
[3259.38 → 3265.66] Nintendo Switch in the same breath as every new handheld PC.
[3265.98 → 3270.10] I also am beginning to view the Steam Deck in a bit of a different light.
[3270.72 → 3270.88] It,
[3271.06 → 3272.00] excuse me,
[3272.06 → 3273.74] is priced very aggressively,
[3274.14 → 3275.20] which is amazing.
[3275.54 → 3280.16] It offers a very console like experience where instant wake,
[3280.38 → 3281.30] instant sleep,
[3281.70 → 3282.20] um,
[3282.74 → 3282.94] are,
[3283.06 → 3285.28] are integral to the experience.
[3285.28 → 3285.94] It's a
[3285.98 → 3288.38] it's a fantastic console.
[3288.38 → 3289.34] Um,
[3289.52 → 3291.98] but much like a console,
[3291.98 → 3295.08] its library is a little bit more limited.
[3295.08 → 3296.30] And a lot of that's,
[3296.30 → 3297.38] it's not Valve's fault.
[3297.46 → 3298.30] It's due to,
[3298.30 → 3299.58] um,
[3299.64 → 3299.80] you know,
[3299.80 → 3302.66] whether it's the developer of the game or the developer of the anti-cheat,
[3302.66 → 3302.90] it's,
[3303.00 → 3304.36] it's down to developers,
[3304.36 → 3305.16] uh,
[3305.16 → 3306.90] either refusal or,
[3306.90 → 3311.88] or unwillingness to build Linux support into their games.
[3312.42 → 3312.82] Um,
[3313.26 → 3313.58] I mean,
[3313.60 → 3313.72] yeah,
[3313.72 → 3314.22] I guess it's,
[3314.46 → 3315.80] I guess it's mostly that,
[3316.20 → 3316.82] uh,
[3316.84 → 3317.62] but it's,
[3317.62 → 3320.54] it's just a different product.
[3320.60 → 3322.02] It's an amazing product.
[3322.12 → 3323.38] The OLED perversion.
[3323.58 → 3324.04] Oh man,
[3324.34 → 3326.52] the screen on it is just incredible.
[3326.52 → 3334.24] But I also have a tendency to lean more toward lean on my own experiences when I'm evaluating products.
[3334.24 → 3336.98] And the reality of it is that DOG ally one,
[3337.14 → 3338.08] I,
[3338.16 → 3342.80] I don't daily drive a steam deck because for me,
[3342.80 → 3344.88] the trade-offs,
[3345.08 → 3345.20] the
[3345.20 → 3351.76] the things that I give up for being on Windows are not worth what I gain by being on a steam deck.
[3351.76 → 3352.30] Of course,
[3352.42 → 3352.72] you know,
[3352.98 → 3354.26] these are devices that,
[3354.68 → 3354.78] you know,
[3354.84 → 3356.70] one of each is sitting in the warehouse.
[3357.16 → 3360.18] So I don't have to necessarily consider the price.
[3360.18 → 3362.50] I was just going to say if,
[3362.64 → 3362.90] if,
[3363.16 → 3363.26] yeah,
[3363.68 → 3364.50] you're covering it now,
[3364.56 → 3366.06] but the steam deck is significantly cheaper.
[3366.14 → 3366.24] Yeah.
[3366.30 → 3368.44] The steam deck is an amazing piece of hardware.
[3368.64 → 3371.96] It's also not as performant as the latest handheld PCs.
[3372.24 → 3372.88] And that's,
[3372.94 → 3373.38] that's again,
[3373.44 → 3374.42] that's part of the trade-off.
[3374.78 → 3375.62] When did it launch?
[3375.70 → 3376.76] It's been a minute,
[3376.94 → 3377.14] dude.
[3377.38 → 3377.66] Yeah.
[3377.90 → 3379.24] Like it's been a few years at this point,
[3379.26 → 3379.60] I think,
[3379.68 → 3380.10] because it was what,
[3380.16 → 3380.64] 2020,
[3381.22 → 3381.54] 2020.
[3382.02 → 3382.62] I know it,
[3382.68 → 3382.80] when,
[3382.86 → 3383.62] when it was announced,
[3383.62 → 3384.98] we were doing land show remotely.
[3385.58 → 3385.98] Um,
[3386.02 → 3386.18] it,
[3386.30 → 3386.54] it,
[3386.54 → 3388.70] it did not launch in 2022.
[3388.70 → 3389.40] Did it?
[3389.96 → 3390.62] Oh my goodness.
[3390.62 → 3391.18] It's 2024.
[3391.64 → 3391.84] Okay.
[3391.94 → 3392.38] Yeah.
[3392.38 → 3392.44] Yeah.
[3392.44 → 3392.68] Oh,
[3392.72 → 3392.96] wow.
[3393.24 → 3393.64] Okay.
[3393.64 → 3397.12] So my problem there wasn't that I didn't realize how long ago the steam deck launched.
[3397.18 → 3398.52] I didn't realize what year it was.
[3400.34 → 3401.50] What is the time?
[3401.90 → 3403.02] It's a current year.
[3404.02 → 3404.38] Anyway.
[3404.98 → 3405.42] Wow.
[3405.46 → 3406.42] That's scary.
[3407.94 → 3408.50] So,
[3409.30 → 3409.76] um,
[3410.04 → 3410.80] Nokia asks,
[3410.80 → 3414.30] do you feel proton OS has mature matured enough to be competitive as an OS?
[3414.46 → 3415.16] I don't know.
[3415.60 → 3419.40] Maybe if steam ever actually released the bloody thing,
[3419.46 → 3420.98] we'd be able to have a conversation about that.
[3421.04 → 3421.18] Sorry.
[3421.28 → 3421.44] Sorry.
[3421.48 → 3421.84] You've just,
[3421.92 → 3430.98] you've touched a bit of a nerve because I've been putting off the Linux challenge V2 for the release of steam OS.
[3431.38 → 3433.66] And every time I asked those guys,
[3433.76 → 3433.94] Hey,
[3434.16 → 3435.00] how's it going?
[3435.32 → 3436.02] They're like,
[3436.34 → 3438.34] we're on it.
[3438.70 → 3439.36] And I'm like,
[3440.00 → 3440.52] right.
[3440.80 → 3442.08] But that's not what I asked.
[3442.14 → 3442.56] I asked,
[3442.68 → 3442.98] is it,
[3443.08 → 3444.38] can it be on my computer?
[3444.52 → 3444.70] Not,
[3444.76 → 3445.60] are you on it?
[3446.26 → 3446.62] Um,
[3446.62 → 3446.90] and,
[3447.10 → 3449.46] and it just keeps not appearing, and I get it.
[3449.70 → 3450.18] Valve's a
[3451.18 → 3452.10] well,
[3452.62 → 3454.10] I was going to say busy company,
[3454.32 → 3456.72] but they've got some stuff going on.
[3456.78 → 3456.92] No,
[3456.98 → 3457.80] they got stuff going on.
[3457.80 → 3458.66] They're making lots of money.
[3459.22 → 3459.58] Yeah.
[3459.96 → 3460.64] And I,
[3460.72 → 3461.12] you know what?
[3461.12 → 3464.34] I'm willing to bet that they have some wild skunk work stuff.
[3464.52 → 3464.90] Probably.
[3465.08 → 3465.36] That they,
[3465.36 → 3466.46] who knows if they'll ever release it.
[3466.58 → 3466.82] Well,
[3466.92 → 3467.10] not,
[3467.28 → 3467.46] yeah,
[3467.56 → 3468.00] I,
[3468.00 → 3468.60] I suspect.
[3469.08 → 3471.44] They're just too busy making tons of money.
[3471.44 → 3472.58] I don't know anything.
[3472.78 → 3476.62] And evaluating the absurd amount more money than they make than all the other companies.
[3476.62 → 3479.30] I don't know anything about the internal workings of Valve.
[3479.56 → 3479.84] Okay.
[3479.92 → 3482.10] Other than that they make disgusting amounts of money.
[3482.10 → 3483.18] I've never worked there.
[3483.18 → 3491.80] But what I suspect based on everything I've seen out of these guys is that they probably build more products than they actually release.
[3491.92 → 3492.38] I'm sure.
[3492.62 → 3493.20] They'd be bored.
[3493.32 → 3494.12] They're making all this money.
[3494.20 → 3494.96] They might as well do something.
[3495.02 → 3496.54] By a significant margin.
[3496.76 → 3497.04] Mm-hmm.
[3497.24 → 3497.60] I mean,
[3497.60 → 3505.92] did you see the rig that they built for that Steam Deck OLED commercial where they built that sphere out of Steam Deck OLED screens?
[3506.44 → 3508.10] I don't think so.
[3508.14 → 3508.26] Yeah.
[3508.30 → 3508.58] It's,
[3508.58 → 3509.20] it's wild.
[3509.32 → 3509.58] It's,
[3509.94 → 3513.16] it is peak because we can't.
[3513.18 → 3514.40] Oh,
[3514.46 → 3514.60] yeah,
[3514.66 → 3515.02] for sure.
[3515.20 → 3516.36] Like 100%.
[3516.36 → 3518.38] They might as well spend all that money on something.
[3518.54 → 3519.88] There was absolutely,
[3519.88 → 3522.86] there was absolutely no reason,
[3523.24 → 3527.36] no reason whatsoever for them to do that practically like that.
[3527.42 → 3529.46] They could have come up with any other concept for a commercial,
[3529.46 → 3532.36] but they did that because somebody was like,
[3532.74 → 3534.24] that'd be cool.
[3534.70 → 3535.16] That'd be neat.
[3535.24 → 3535.84] Can we afford it?
[3536.02 → 3536.44] Easily.
[3536.66 → 3537.64] Just send it.
[3538.50 → 3538.74] Man,
[3538.82 → 3542.36] I really wish those guys would hurry up and get a flipping,
[3542.36 → 3555.32] get a flipping index to go in here because there have been some advancements in lens technology and in screen technology that I'm sure Valve has been doing stuff with.
[3555.42 → 3556.04] They just won't,
[3556.36 → 3557.54] they just won't give me my new,
[3557.64 → 3558.96] they won't give me my new headset.
[3559.64 → 3560.36] Really want it.
[3560.54 → 3560.86] More,
[3561.06 → 3561.36] please.
[3561.36 → 3563.38] So,
[3563.44 → 3563.60] yeah,
[3563.84 → 3564.00] yeah,
[3564.06 → 3564.38] Steam Deck.
[3564.64 → 3565.26] Super cool.
[3565.76 → 3568.54] It'll definitely be back in the conversation around Steam Deck 2.
[3569.64 → 3571.08] We definitely will,
[3571.30 → 3571.58] you know,
[3571.60 → 3572.14] bring it up.
[3572.22 → 3572.38] I mean,
[3572.52 → 3572.76] oh,
[3572.86 → 3574.04] the DOG Ally X,
[3574.44 → 3575.86] people are talking about that.
[3575.98 → 3576.26] Apparently,
[3576.32 → 3577.52] there's a leak or something.
[3577.82 → 3578.04] Yeah,
[3578.16 → 3578.68] I think,
[3578.78 → 3579.90] I think that's,
[3579.90 → 3581.30] that's a topic in here,
[3581.36 → 3581.76] actually,
[3581.98 → 3582.94] the DOG Ally X.
[3583.32 → 3585.84] I don't think it's like a huge jump,
[3585.94 → 3586.14] though.
[3588.70 → 3590.24] A little bit more battery life.
[3591.10 → 3591.30] I,
[3591.30 → 3592.78] I think it's like a
[3593.08 → 3593.40] I mean,
[3593.48 → 3593.96] to be fair,
[3594.06 → 3596.28] they're naming it fairly properly for this,
[3596.40 → 3597.08] but I think it's like,
[3597.12 → 3598.14] kind of like a pro model,
[3598.38 → 3599.92] not a generational leap,
[3600.10 → 3600.72] if that makes sense.
[3601.60 → 3601.78] Yeah,
[3601.84 → 3602.18] should we,
[3602.26 → 3603.14] should we jump into that?
[3603.20 → 3604.42] And then we'll do the other merch message?
[3604.58 → 3605.30] We can do that,
[3605.36 → 3605.54] sure.
[3605.54 → 3606.46] DOG Ally X,
[3606.54 → 3608.64] ASUS has teased the DOG Ally X,
[3608.74 → 3612.54] which they claimed is somewhere between a sequel to the original Ally,
[3612.54 → 3613.56] and a revision of it.
[3613.90 → 3615.28] Featuring a new black colour,
[3615.40 → 3617.26] the X will sport larger battery life,
[3617.56 → 3619.26] allegedly way more than,
[3620.40 → 3621.14] way more,
[3621.20 → 3624.08] way more than 30 to 40% more capacity.
[3624.26 → 3624.72] I doubt it.
[3624.76 → 3625.92] It's probably something more like that.
[3626.04 → 3628.22] It's probably like 30 to 40% capacity.
[3628.42 → 3631.06] I think this is written as allegedly way more,
[3631.46 → 3633.50] like 30 to 40% more capacity.
[3633.50 → 3634.28] That's what I'm assuming.
[3634.66 → 3634.98] Anyway,
[3635.34 → 3636.06] SVP,
[3636.16 → 3636.82] what does that mean?
[3637.44 → 3638.22] Senior Vice President.
[3638.42 → 3638.62] Cool.
[3638.92 → 3640.46] Sean Yen hinted at The Verge,
[3640.54 → 3642.46] that the new handhelds would give at least,
[3642.54 → 3645.18] three hours of battery life playing intensive games.
[3645.50 → 3645.78] However,
[3645.86 → 3649.52] the device will be slightly heavier because of said larger battery.
[3649.88 → 3654.00] ASUS says the Ally X should have more than the 16 gigs of RAM,
[3654.26 → 3657.44] the Ally non-X currently has,
[3657.76 → 3660.60] and it will apparently be repairable
[3660.60 → 3664.50] with redesigned joystick modules that are more interchangeable.
[3664.58 → 3665.80] So just the joysticks are repairable?
[3665.80 → 3666.50] That sounds pretty cool.
[3666.56 → 3666.70] I mean,
[3666.70 → 3667.02] that's something.
[3667.02 → 3667.66] That's a good thing.
[3668.26 → 3668.42] Yeah.
[3668.90 → 3669.08] Yeah.
[3669.62 → 3675.20] It will feature an M.2 2280 slot rather than the 2230 SD slot.
[3675.20 → 3681.84] So if you want to throw like an eight terabyte SSD because you enjoy having an SSD that costs-
[3681.84 → 3684.52] It costs three times as much as your computer.
[3686.52 → 3690.50] ASUS still won't admit that the Ally's SD card reader had any fault,
[3690.50 → 3696.58] but the Ally X will have a rearranged motherboard layout that will just happen to move the SD card slot away from the vents.
[3696.80 → 3697.28] Interesting.
[3697.28 → 3697.68] However,
[3697.88 → 3705.06] the screen will be exactly the same and so will the AMD Z1 or Z1 Extreme APU.
[3705.42 → 3706.38] The Steam Deck OLED,
[3706.64 → 3707.50] this is not.
[3708.84 → 3709.40] So yeah,
[3709.40 → 3709.92] that makes sense.
[3710.00 → 3710.80] More battery life,
[3710.92 → 3712.24] which is fair.
[3712.46 → 3712.86] I understand it.
[3712.98 → 3714.12] A Steam Deck OLED,
[3714.30 → 3715.00] this is not.
[3715.28 → 3715.88] Isn't that what I said?
[3716.22 → 3716.38] Yeah.
[3716.54 → 3716.92] Sure.
[3717.16 → 3717.38] Yeah.
[3717.56 → 3717.90] Anyway,
[3718.10 → 3718.84] but yes.
[3718.96 → 3719.40] So it will,
[3719.48 → 3721.36] it will apparently not be getting an OLED screen.
[3722.30 → 3722.70] Okay.
[3722.86 → 3723.82] Coming on June 2nd.
[3723.92 → 3724.06] Yeah.
[3724.06 → 3724.54] Um,
[3725.50 → 3728.78] our discussion question here is what other upgrades would you have liked to see?
[3729.26 → 3729.50] Uh,
[3729.56 → 3729.74] I,
[3729.80 → 3730.88] I can't comment on anything.
[3731.22 → 3731.52] It's been so soon.
[3731.62 → 3732.78] Other than what's in here.
[3732.92 → 3733.50] I mean,
[3733.52 → 3735.58] I wouldn't have minded seeing more performance,
[3735.82 → 3738.70] but I guess more battery life is also pretty good.
[3739.04 → 3741.92] I would have liked to see another USB-C port.
[3742.70 → 3743.10] Um,
[3743.34 → 3743.64] there,
[3743.94 → 3744.28] ugh.
[3745.14 → 3747.38] I'm honestly surprised they have a revision already.
[3747.60 → 3748.98] On my trip to Japan,
[3749.74 → 3752.64] I had this brilliant idea that on the plane,
[3752.64 → 3753.44] uh,
[3753.44 → 3757.62] my kids could play like a multiplayer games with,
[3757.62 → 3757.96] uh,
[3757.96 → 3758.76] with this portable.
[3759.40 → 3759.80] Um,
[3759.84 → 3760.92] I grabbed one of the
[3761.00 → 3761.70] one of the screens.
[3761.82 → 3763.24] It happens to be in Asus,
[3763.30 → 3765.52] like DOG portable monitor.
[3765.76 → 3766.16] Uh,
[3766.16 → 3770.20] so I grabbed one of the ones out of my car and I brought it with me so that
[3770.20 → 3774.34] they could put it in the middle seat and sit three abreast and then play
[3774.34 → 3775.14] games together.
[3775.14 → 3776.72] And I could run them off the ally.
[3776.86 → 3777.58] And I was like,
[3777.62 → 3777.80] man,
[3777.84 → 3778.58] that would be sick.
[3778.58 → 3783.24] And so I brought a USB-C cable and I plugged it between the ally and the
[3783.24 → 3783.78] monitor and went,
[3784.14 → 3784.34] Oh,
[3784.44 → 3785.10] hold on a second.
[3786.08 → 3787.90] It's not like this monitor supports power delivery.
[3787.96 → 3789.70] How on earth am I going to charge this?
[3789.80 → 3793.10] Did I bring a micro HDMI to USB-C adapt?
[3793.24 → 3793.40] No,
[3793.46 → 3794.38] then I still couldn't charge.
[3794.50 → 3794.68] Oh,
[3794.84 → 3797.72] so you need like a doc.
[3797.96 → 3798.22] Yeah.
[3798.34 → 3798.52] So,
[3798.66 → 3798.84] yeah,
[3798.90 → 3799.40] exactly.
[3799.54 → 3799.84] Exactly.
[3799.92 → 3800.44] And I didn't,
[3800.52 → 3801.64] I didn't think to bring a doc.
[3801.70 → 3803.20] It's completely on me,
[3803.20 → 3805.46] but the difference maker,
[3805.64 → 3810.42] the difference maker would have been if it just had two USB-C ports,
[3810.60 → 3813.78] like so many other handhelds do.
[3814.42 → 3814.78] Um,
[3815.32 → 3815.94] so I would,
[3816.04 → 3817.28] I would love to see that.
[3817.36 → 3819.42] That's something that has affected me personally.
[3819.66 → 3820.82] But other than that,
[3820.84 → 3821.06] I,
[3821.16 → 3821.48] I don't know.
[3821.50 → 3821.66] I mean,
[3821.66 → 3823.18] I'd love to see Hall effect joysticks.
[3823.78 → 3824.22] Um,
[3825.32 → 3828.06] I guess the repairability might help a little bit.
[3828.06 → 3828.30] No,
[3828.40 → 3828.58] no,
[3828.64 → 3828.98] I'm just,
[3829.10 → 3829.22] no,
[3829.28 → 3829.52] I'm just,
[3829.72 → 3831.94] I'm that I was asked what I would like to see.
[3831.94 → 3832.34] Yeah.
[3832.42 → 3834.90] I can only comment on what's written here.
[3834.90 → 3836.88] Cause who knows what I might or might not know.
[3837.20 → 3837.58] Faster,
[3837.68 → 3837.80] better,
[3837.92 → 3838.70] stronger is cool.
[3838.82 → 3839.66] It's a portable device.
[3839.74 → 3839.98] You could,
[3840.12 → 3842.12] you could hope basically everything would be better.
[3842.26 → 3842.58] I'm just,
[3842.68 → 3844.42] I'm surprised there's a revision already.
[3844.68 → 3845.14] That's all.
[3845.24 → 3848.90] Cause how long is the allies quite a bit newer than the steam deck?
[3849.26 → 3849.62] Um,
[3852.74 → 3853.10] no,
[3853.18 → 3854.24] the steam deck's huge.
[3854.44 → 3854.80] No,
[3854.86 → 3854.96] no,
[3854.96 → 3855.08] no,
[3855.08 → 3855.22] no,
[3855.22 → 3855.26] no.
[3855.86 → 3857.12] More recently released.
[3857.22 → 3857.38] Oh,
[3857.44 → 3857.60] oh,
[3857.64 → 3858.04] oh,
[3858.04 → 3858.30] oh,
[3858.30 → 3858.48] oh,
[3858.48 → 3858.76] oh.
[3858.76 → 3859.32] Um,
[3859.36 → 3859.94] so yeah,
[3859.96 → 3861.40] it was released June 13th,
[3861.40 → 3861.92] 2023.
[3861.94 → 3864.56] So it's been less than a year, and they're revising it already.
[3865.06 → 3866.90] That's pretty fast on,
[3867.04 → 3867.84] in the device realm.
[3867.94 → 3868.08] Well,
[3868.12 → 3868.34] I mean,
[3868.42 → 3868.94] that's the
[3869.04 → 3870.74] that's the IT industry cycle though.
[3870.96 → 3871.98] And that's again,
[3872.00 → 3874.38] something that makes the steam deck feel a lot more console.
[3874.38 → 3879.12] Like to me is it's very clearly on a more console like refresh cycle.
[3879.32 → 3879.74] I mean,
[3879.76 → 3880.20] it's still,
[3880.40 → 3882.76] that steam deck is still RDNA two,
[3883.10 → 3883.56] isn't it?
[3884.40 → 3885.58] I think RDNA two,
[3885.66 → 3885.94] excuse me,
[3886.02 → 3886.52] Zen two.
[3887.36 → 3888.34] I think so.
[3889.66 → 3890.06] Yeah.
[3890.06 → 3890.98] Yeah.
[3891.64 → 3892.04] Yeah.
[3892.04 → 3892.08] Yeah.
[3892.08 → 3895.90] Even though Zen three was coming, and we're already on Zen four now,
[3895.90 → 3896.56] like they could,
[3896.66 → 3897.46] if they were just,
[3897.46 → 3897.96] you know,
[3897.98 → 3900.30] using a random APU,
[3900.30 → 3900.94] uh,
[3900.94 → 3903.56] off of AMD's out of AMD's product catalogue,
[3903.84 → 3905.82] then they could easily be revising it.
[3905.88 → 3911.14] But it's clear that valve is serious about treating it like a console where they lock in the spec.
[3911.14 → 3912.06] And they,
[3912.06 → 3912.36] they,
[3912.36 → 3912.52] they,
[3912.66 → 3916.88] they build performance targets for various games.
[3917.00 → 3924.18] They build profiles, and it's not just a PC where you're expected to just kind of tinker around with your graphic sliders.
[3924.28 → 3924.72] You can,
[3925.30 → 3926.22] because man,
[3926.30 → 3928.60] valve is pretty chill about that kind of stuff.
[3928.70 → 3928.98] Like here,
[3929.08 → 3929.22] yeah,
[3929.28 → 3930.78] why don't you play around with your power profile?
[3930.90 → 3931.44] And why don't you,
[3931.74 → 3933.08] why don't you play around with all these settings?
[3933.20 → 3933.38] But,
[3933.72 → 3934.32] but they're,
[3934.40 → 3936.06] they're obviously trying to,
[3936.22 → 3936.52] yeah,
[3936.52 → 3938.44] they're trying to create a console like experience.
[3939.24 → 3939.64] Okay.
[3941.14 → 3941.54] Second,
[3941.54 → 3943.48] we're technically jumping to a second.
[3944.22 → 3945.24] We're still on time.
[3945.64 → 3945.96] Uh,
[3945.96 → 3946.34] let's see.
[3946.56 → 3946.76] Hey,
[3946.92 → 3947.20] DLL.
[3947.36 → 3952.12] I was recently thrust into a manager position after the sudden ousting of my boss.
[3952.28 → 3953.84] We have a team of 50 people.
[3954.08 → 3958.86] Any tips for dealing with employees who make the same mistakes over and over?
[3960.18 → 3960.88] Fire them.
[3962.32 → 3962.72] I'm,
[3962.72 → 3963.02] I'm,
[3963.02 → 3963.62] I'm actually,
[3963.74 → 3966.50] I'm actually kidding because it's not that simple.
[3966.52 → 3967.44] I mean,
[3967.56 → 3969.40] people make mistakes.
[3969.88 → 3971.12] I make mistakes.
[3972.00 → 3972.66] I like,
[3973.10 → 3973.48] here,
[3973.54 → 3973.66] what,
[3973.68 → 3974.08] what are the
[3974.18 → 3974.48] what are here?
[3974.56 → 3975.30] What are the marriage,
[3975.30 → 3976.10] uh,
[3976.10 → 3977.50] like divorce statistics,
[3978.12 → 3978.92] divorce rates,
[3979.04 → 3979.86] close to 50%.
[3979.86 → 3980.48] Um,
[3980.56 → 3980.70] here,
[3980.78 → 3981.40] divorce rates,
[3981.48 → 3982.00] USA,
[3982.72 → 3983.12] um,
[3983.18 → 3983.66] afternoon.
[3985.12 → 3986.70] A lot of that is repeat offenders.
[3986.70 → 3987.32] As far as I know,
[3987.36 → 3987.50] though,
[3987.66 → 3989.04] the overall trend in the
[3989.24 → 3989.56] okay.
[3989.68 → 3989.84] Yeah,
[3989.84 → 3990.02] no,
[3990.10 → 3990.34] we're not,
[3990.42 → 3990.60] we're not,
[3990.60 → 3993.42] the point is that people make mistakes.
[3993.70 → 3996.34] They make them over and over and over.
[3996.34 → 3996.78] Again,
[3996.78 → 4000.36] it is a serious strain on the relationship.
[4000.80 → 4001.32] Um,
[4001.36 → 4007.86] so apparently first marriages is around 40 to 50% and second marriages around 60 to 67%.
[4007.86 → 4008.08] Yeah,
[4008.08 → 4008.58] there you go.
[4008.92 → 4016.94] So if your hope is to build a team of people that are not going to make mistakes over and over and over again.
[4016.94 → 4024.62] And the reason that I'm bringing up marriages is that's probably the relationship in our lives that is most committed.
[4025.30 → 4025.74] Um,
[4026.70 → 4027.82] and I'm not talking like,
[4027.88 → 4029.38] like a parent child relationship.
[4029.38 → 4031.94] I'm talking voluntary relationships.
[4031.94 → 4036.30] This is probably the relationship in our lives that is most committed,
[4036.50 → 4037.66] at least on paper.
[4037.90 → 4040.56] And it is one that we clearly,
[4040.56 → 4041.72] um,
[4041.92 → 4047.02] allow the day-to-day issues that we deal with trying to work as a team.
[4047.02 → 4047.24] Sorry,
[4047.30 → 4048.16] I keep gesturing at Luke,
[4048.28 → 4050.12] but maybe Yvonne is somewhere over there.
[4050.48 → 4050.96] Um,
[4050.96 → 4052.56] it's one where,
[4052.76 → 4053.16] where we,
[4053.26 → 4060.20] we clearly allow the day-to-day issues that we encounter when we're trying to work together as a team to destroy.
[4060.64 → 4064.74] And that rate of destruction is something like,
[4064.86 → 4065.18] well,
[4065.34 → 4065.76] apparently,
[4066.24 → 4066.50] you know,
[4066.54 → 4070.28] 30 to 65% or something like that.
[4070.28 → 4071.56] So with that in mind,
[4071.56 → 4075.82] if you build a team that is three people,
[4076.48 → 4082.58] odds are you're going to want to divorce one of them in some period of time.
[4083.74 → 4084.22] Yeah.
[4084.82 → 4087.72] So you just have to find ways.
[4088.56 → 4090.62] Polyamorous people are just in shambles right now.
[4093.14 → 4094.80] I don't know how you guys do it.
[4095.52 → 4096.16] I mean,
[4096.16 → 4096.40] look,
[4096.52 → 4097.10] I'm not,
[4097.20 → 4097.76] I'm not,
[4097.82 → 4098.02] I'm,
[4098.10 → 4098.46] I'm,
[4098.46 → 4099.36] I'm not judging.
[4099.36 → 4100.02] Uh,
[4100.04 → 4100.40] you know,
[4100.40 → 4101.16] like the
[4101.16 → 4101.52] the
[4101.52 → 4101.82] the
[4101.82 → 4102.10] the
[4102.10 → 4102.26] the
[4102.26 → 4104.22] the relationship style that,
[4104.22 → 4104.90] you know,
[4104.90 → 4106.86] works for me might not work for you.
[4106.86 → 4109.94] And what works for you today might not work for you tomorrow.
[4109.94 → 4112.08] What works for me now might not work for me later.
[4112.08 → 4112.40] You know,
[4112.64 → 4113.02] this stuff,
[4113.10 → 4113.28] you know,
[4113.28 → 4113.78] this stuff is,
[4113.84 → 4114.14] it's all,
[4114.22 → 4114.38] it's,
[4114.38 → 4115.26] it's fluid and it,
[4115.32 → 4115.50] you know,
[4115.50 → 4116.20] it's all cool.
[4116.32 → 4117.28] I have no judgment here.
[4117.28 → 4118.68] There's a zero judgment zone,
[4118.84 → 4122.20] but I have no idea how you do it.
[4122.38 → 4122.52] I,
[4122.54 → 4123.00] I just,
[4123.12 → 4123.28] I,
[4123.56 → 4123.80] man,
[4123.94 → 4125.60] maintaining one relationship.
[4125.88 → 4126.24] It's like,
[4126.72 → 4126.98] and,
[4127.06 → 4127.24] and,
[4127.32 → 4129.34] and to be clear that Yvonne's,
[4129.36 → 4129.86] great.
[4130.48 → 4130.92] Like,
[4131.98 → 4132.76] dude,
[4132.86 → 4134.80] like I'm extremely lucky,
[4135.08 → 4137.56] but man,
[4137.66 → 4138.56] relationships take work.
[4138.60 → 4140.56] Like if I had two Yvonne's in my life,
[4140.64 → 4141.04] be like,
[4141.04 → 4146.56] things would be so incredibly well planned and organized though.
[4146.86 → 4147.56] That's true.
[4147.56 → 4149.86] But what if one of them planned it one way?
[4149.92 → 4150.72] Oh no.
[4150.92 → 4152.94] And the other organized it another way.
[4153.78 → 4155.22] And there was a conflict.
[4156.72 → 4157.90] He's got to step back.
[4158.84 → 4159.80] He's got to step back.
[4159.86 → 4160.40] You got to retreat.
[4160.52 → 4160.64] No,
[4160.70 → 4161.30] there's no way.
[4161.40 → 4161.54] No,
[4161.60 → 4162.10] there's no way.
[4162.22 → 4162.24] I,
[4162.24 → 4162.56] I,
[4162.56 → 4162.94] I mean,
[4162.96 → 4164.16] I don't want them both dead.
[4164.16 → 4167.06] I mean,
[4167.10 → 4167.26] yeah,
[4167.28 → 4168.08] one of them might win,
[4168.18 → 4169.78] but the other would be definitely,
[4170.16 → 4170.56] you know,
[4171.04 → 4172.32] in pieces too.
[4172.46 → 4172.60] Yeah.
[4172.60 → 4173.38] Like not,
[4173.52 → 4174.60] they wouldn't be alive for long.
[4174.78 → 4175.02] Yeah.
[4175.10 → 4175.68] You know what I mean?
[4175.76 → 4176.10] It's a
[4176.18 → 4176.58] yeah,
[4176.64 → 4176.96] you don't,
[4177.04 → 4177.66] Thunder dome.
[4177.86 → 4179.82] Unstoppable force and immovable object.
[4180.38 → 4180.74] Um,
[4181.12 → 4184.10] what were we talking about?
[4184.10 → 4184.60] What were we talking about?
[4184.62 → 4184.82] Right.
[4184.92 → 4185.30] How to,
[4185.40 → 4187.38] how to manage a team where people make the same mistakes.
[4187.38 → 4187.56] Yeah.
[4188.00 → 4189.02] Evaluate the mistake.
[4189.46 → 4190.50] See how bad it is.
[4190.70 → 4191.00] Coach it.
[4191.40 → 4191.76] Yeah.
[4191.80 → 4193.14] If this is a terrible thing,
[4193.20 → 4194.00] work on coaching it.
[4194.00 → 4197.76] If you can't coach it, and it doesn't stop at a certain point,
[4197.82 → 4199.38] he was serious when he mentioned it,
[4199.40 → 4201.58] but at a certain point you do have to let people go,
[4201.68 → 4204.00] but there are a lot of steps that you can take on the way.
[4204.08 → 4204.32] I mean,
[4204.32 → 4204.92] uh,
[4204.92 → 4205.44] you can,
[4205.58 → 4206.02] you can,
[4206.02 → 4206.34] you know,
[4206.34 → 4208.08] put together a performance improvement plan,
[4208.18 → 4209.72] lay out very clear guidelines.
[4210.54 → 4210.74] That's,
[4210.78 → 4211.38] that's a big thing.
[4211.40 → 4211.78] It has,
[4211.90 → 4214.70] they have to know way ahead of time that this,
[4215.20 → 4217.96] if not fixed could result in a
[4217.96 → 4220.22] a firing or whatever else and,
[4220.32 → 4222.58] and give them updates on how well they're doing,
[4222.68 → 4223.90] check in with them on stuff.
[4224.00 → 4224.76] See how,
[4224.90 → 4226.52] if they're implementing things to fix it,
[4226.60 → 4227.88] try to help them implement things,
[4227.96 → 4230.38] try to come up with ideas for them to implement solutions,
[4230.38 → 4232.32] to try to help them progress on this problem.
[4232.66 → 4233.88] If they never do,
[4234.02 → 4235.32] maybe this just isn't the right job.
[4235.54 → 4235.64] Yeah.
[4235.64 → 4236.16] And you,
[4236.26 → 4237.54] good thing you didn't marry them.
[4237.76 → 4238.00] Yeah.
[4238.00 → 4238.60] Yeah.
[4238.60 → 4241.22] And you know what?
[4241.52 → 4245.60] They might be awesome, and they might be super successful in another role
[4245.60 → 4246.24] somewhere else.
[4246.34 → 4246.60] Totally.
[4246.78 → 4247.56] But sometimes,
[4247.56 → 4252.02] sometimes the healthier thing for both people in a relationship,
[4252.02 → 4252.84] and you know what?
[4253.12 → 4254.52] Working together is,
[4254.52 → 4255.70] uh,
[4255.70 → 4256.84] a relationship.
[4256.84 → 4259.52] It's not a relationship in the same sense that,
[4259.60 → 4259.86] you know,
[4259.92 → 4261.92] a marriage is a relationship,
[4261.92 → 4263.70] but it's anything.
[4263.82 → 4265.64] A friendship is a relationship.
[4265.64 → 4267.42] Being colleagues is a relationship.
[4267.42 → 4269.38] They're at different levels,
[4269.50 → 4269.96] obviously,
[4269.96 → 4274.08] but sometimes a relationship is just not working.
[4274.24 → 4274.40] Yeah.
[4274.52 → 4275.38] For both parties.
[4275.54 → 4275.70] Yeah.
[4275.76 → 4279.00] And the better thing is to have it not be,
[4279.34 → 4281.02] to not be in that relationship anymore.
[4282.10 → 4282.54] Yeah.
[4283.40 → 4283.82] I don't know,
[4284.12 → 4285.36] but just don't read some books.
[4285.50 → 4285.80] Try to,
[4285.80 → 4286.56] try to avoid it.
[4286.66 → 4287.64] That's also very helpful.
[4287.92 → 4288.12] Yeah.
[4288.12 → 4288.50] For real.
[4288.60 → 4289.18] I got a lot of stuff from reading books.
[4289.28 → 4289.44] Read.
[4289.70 → 4289.88] And,
[4290.02 → 4291.52] but yeah,
[4291.58 → 4291.82] just,
[4291.94 → 4293.40] just make sure it's not a surprise.
[4293.40 → 4294.44] That's my big thing.
[4295.24 → 4295.64] Um,
[4296.12 → 4296.72] work with them,
[4296.80 → 4298.68] try to really heavily communicate.
[4299.14 → 4299.50] Uh,
[4299.50 → 4299.76] don't,
[4299.76 → 4300.96] don't just blind side them.
[4301.44 → 4301.70] Um,
[4301.70 → 4305.58] give them the chance to receive that feedback and improve.
[4305.76 → 4306.68] And like any relationship,
[4306.68 → 4309.96] don't let things build up and then explode at them.
[4309.96 → 4310.18] Yeah.
[4310.18 → 4311.94] Because that's not helpful for anybody.
[4312.02 → 4312.38] Yeah.
[4312.72 → 4313.62] On either side.
[4313.74 → 4315.16] Timely feedback is really,
[4315.28 → 4315.78] really important.
[4315.78 → 4317.98] And it can be hard because I'm sorry,
[4318.02 → 4319.68] did you say you have 50 reports?
[4319.96 → 4320.60] That's too many.
[4320.60 → 4321.58] That's way too many.
[4321.58 → 4323.66] That is like three to four times.
[4323.78 → 4326.58] I'm hoping that they are one of the managers of 50.
[4326.72 → 4328.08] It's four to five times too many.
[4328.08 → 4328.48] Actually,
[4328.60 → 4329.66] it's doing the math here.
[4329.76 → 4332.16] Like that is way too many people.
[4332.96 → 4333.32] Um,
[4333.44 → 4336.00] so if that's the idea,
[4336.00 → 4338.40] then good luck.
[4340.40 → 4341.54] Sheaf 2k says,
[4341.62 → 4345.04] the idea of any company ever starting a pip in earnest is laughable.
[4345.04 → 4352.28] As a company that has definitely used pips with success to rehabilitate,
[4352.28 → 4352.90] uh,
[4352.90 → 4353.70] relationships.
[4354.28 → 4354.78] Um,
[4355.24 → 4355.64] you're wrong.
[4355.64 → 4357.28] I think they are often misused.
[4357.28 → 4358.00] I think they are often misused.
[4358.00 → 4358.50] Oh,
[4358.50 → 4359.14] a hundred percent.
[4359.14 → 4359.56] So,
[4359.56 → 4361.66] so I'm sure maybe,
[4361.66 → 4362.62] uh,
[4362.62 → 4367.12] Sharif has had one of the misused against them before or know someone where that's happened
[4367.12 → 4367.54] or whatever.
[4368.06 → 4370.34] A pip is a performance improvement plan,
[4370.34 → 4371.50] uh,
[4371.50 → 4375.62] which is essentially an extremely direct form of communication of,
[4375.62 → 4376.18] Hey,
[4376.18 → 4378.84] this thing is not being done up to standard.
[4378.84 → 4381.34] This is exactly what the standard should look like.
[4381.34 → 4383.74] This is exactly where the shortfalls are.
[4383.74 → 4387.20] And this is the timeline during which there needs to be an improvement.
[4387.46 → 4387.70] Yeah.
[4388.52 → 4389.80] So it's just a super,
[4389.94 → 4392.76] super documented and very direct form of that communication,
[4392.76 → 4393.84] which theoretically,
[4393.84 → 4394.72] in my opinion,
[4394.72 → 4399.06] you should have softer forms of communication before getting there.
[4400.10 → 4400.58] Um,
[4400.80 → 4404.82] but it is absolutely a step along the chain and there's people that can get there
[4404.82 → 4407.90] and then come all the way back and do well and just move on from it.
[4407.90 → 4411.48] And there's people that will fail the pip, and then it is what it is.
[4411.48 → 4415.78] But there are companies that use pips to just fire people with documentation,
[4415.78 → 4417.66] which is not how they should be used.
[4417.78 → 4419.80] They should be used to try to solve a problem.
[4420.44 → 4420.84] Um,
[4421.62 → 4423.26] so I think they're often misused,
[4423.36 → 4424.90] which is why they have the bad rap that they have.
[4425.36 → 4425.80] Yeah,
[4425.98 → 4426.22] no,
[4426.30 → 4426.54] a hundred,
[4426.64 → 4427.26] a hundred percent.
[4427.44 → 4429.14] They deserve the bad rap,
[4429.24 → 4435.14] but that doesn't mean that every company is monstrous and just uses them as a paper trail to fire people.
[4435.24 → 4435.38] Yeah.
[4435.96 → 4436.16] Yeah.
[4437.48 → 4439.14] Elijah's had 12 pips already.
[4439.62 → 4440.78] That's what he says in chat.
[4441.48 → 4443.14] At least he was,
[4443.26 → 4446.50] at least he was on the ball enough to put a slash S on it this time.
[4446.74 → 4456.32] We've had to have a lot of conversations recently about just like jokes that we kind of can't make anymore because people don't seem to understand that their jokes,
[4456.40 → 4461.74] or at least a percentage of the viewer base doesn't seem to understand when things are a joke.
[4461.92 → 4462.04] Um,
[4462.04 → 4464.54] I actually forget what one from writer's meeting was today,
[4464.54 → 4468.98] but I had to have just kind of a downer conversation with everyone where it was like,
[4469.04 → 4469.24] look,
[4469.70 → 4472.66] that's a title that some time ago,
[4472.66 → 4473.54] um,
[4473.54 → 4474.26] I would have said,
[4474.36 → 4474.50] yeah,
[4474.50 → 4475.30] that's hilarious.
[4476.12 → 4476.48] Um,
[4476.80 → 4478.04] now people are going to take it seriously.
[4478.04 → 4478.72] And,
[4478.72 → 4478.78] and,
[4478.78 → 4480.12] and yeah,
[4480.12 → 4481.24] I get talked to the most about jokes.
[4481.32 → 4481.42] No,
[4481.46 → 4482.16] actually you don't.
[4482.70 → 4483.02] Um,
[4483.50 → 4483.68] yeah,
[4483.70 → 4484.02] it was,
[4484.10 → 4484.94] and it was like,
[4485.06 → 4485.38] uh,
[4485.38 → 4487.30] like it was one of those jokes that was like,
[4487.30 → 4489.88] I've made a huge mistake or I never,
[4490.82 → 4491.10] I know.
[4491.20 → 4491.36] Yeah.
[4491.36 → 4491.58] Yeah.
[4491.58 → 4491.60] Yeah.
[4491.60 → 4492.20] The title was,
[4492.30 → 4493.44] we made a big mistake.
[4494.18 → 4501.68] And unfortunately we're in an environment now where a significant number of people,
[4501.78 → 4503.14] enough people that it,
[4503.42 → 4506.60] that it seems to affect sentiment towards our company.
[4506.60 → 4507.02] Yeah.
[4507.10 → 4508.68] We'll read that headline and go,
[4509.00 → 4509.14] Oh,
[4509.16 → 4511.04] those guys made a mistake again.
[4511.18 → 4511.46] Yeah.
[4511.90 → 4512.42] Yeah.
[4512.88 → 4513.56] When it's just,
[4513.62 → 4514.70] it's just a title.
[4514.84 → 4516.24] Calm the fuck down.
[4516.88 → 4518.56] It's just a title of a video.
[4518.56 → 4521.04] You think that by the time we title the video,
[4521.36 → 4522.40] like we didn't,
[4522.96 → 4525.02] we didn't problem-solve the steps.
[4525.02 → 4526.10] Like we didn't,
[4526.10 → 4526.64] we didn't,
[4526.64 → 4526.92] you know,
[4526.96 → 4527.36] figure,
[4527.58 → 4528.66] figure some stuff out.
[4528.66 → 4529.38] Like we're,
[4529.84 → 4530.30] it's,
[4530.36 → 4530.60] it's,
[4530.66 → 4531.86] it's a mechanism to,
[4531.96 → 4533.40] to draw people into the video.
[4533.40 → 4533.66] Right.
[4533.72 → 4534.46] And like,
[4534.64 → 4535.02] um,
[4535.14 → 4535.58] oh man,
[4535.68 → 4536.00] proof,
[4536.18 → 4537.86] proof committed a sin today.
[4537.86 → 4539.08] He didn't do anything wrong.
[4539.58 → 4540.06] And,
[4540.14 → 4540.78] uh,
[4540.80 → 4541.12] you know,
[4541.12 → 4541.46] it's,
[4541.88 → 4544.64] it's the same thing where some period of time ago I'd have been like,
[4544.72 → 4546.20] that's hilarious.
[4546.86 → 4547.28] Um,
[4547.40 → 4547.94] let's,
[4548.04 → 4548.20] uh,
[4548.20 → 4549.72] let's do that as our intro,
[4549.72 → 4551.30] but a significant number,
[4551.36 → 4556.24] of people just whether it's sort of a lack of social awareness or whether it's,
[4556.24 → 4556.76] um,
[4556.88 → 4557.62] whether it's just,
[4557.78 → 4558.28] yeah,
[4558.36 → 4562.70] whether it's just a current environment problem where what's real and what's a joke is just
[4562.70 → 4563.86] so blurry,
[4564.00 → 4565.52] not really clear anymore.
[4565.52 → 4566.34] Um,
[4566.34 → 4568.28] the intro that he had written was for,
[4568.44 → 4570.04] we did,
[4570.10 → 4570.62] um,
[4570.62 → 4576.82] we did another AliExpress shopping spree video where five people were basically told,
[4576.86 → 4577.30] okay,
[4577.30 → 4582.36] it's a competition to buy the weirdest computer component on AliExpress.
[4582.48 → 4582.86] That's fun.
[4583.04 → 4583.46] And yeah,
[4583.56 → 4583.86] it is.
[4583.86 → 4584.04] Yeah.
[4584.04 → 4584.78] It's totally fun.
[4584.78 → 4587.96] And so he had this intro written for it that was,
[4587.96 → 4589.00] um,
[4589.62 → 4590.46] like something,
[4590.58 → 4590.82] something,
[4590.96 → 4591.24] something.
[4591.76 → 4595.02] And their job is basically to waste my money.
[4595.12 → 4595.32] Wait,
[4595.64 → 4596.14] what?
[4596.26 → 4597.82] How much of my money did you waste?
[4597.96 → 4598.28] You know?
[4598.62 → 4600.88] And Proof loves that.
[4600.88 → 4606.02] Like he thinks that stuff's hilarious because I mean,
[4606.02 → 4611.28] as the primary shareholder of Linus media group that effectively when he,
[4611.46 → 4615.76] when he blows money on like a paint job for his car,
[4615.94 → 4617.18] he's like,
[4617.18 → 4618.50] yeah,
[4618.58 → 4619.16] let's go.
[4619.34 → 4619.38] Like,
[4619.44 → 4620.32] like that's his,
[4620.44 → 4621.50] that's his sense of humour.
[4621.50 → 4621.74] Right.
[4621.78 → 4622.06] And,
[4622.06 → 4625.86] and Jake tends to be one of the ones that leans pretty hard into that as well.
[4625.86 → 4626.12] Because he,
[4626.30 → 4628.42] he genuinely just thinks it's funny.
[4628.42 → 4632.08] And then you get these people that are,
[4632.22 → 4632.76] that are like,
[4633.08 → 4633.32] yeah,
[4633.34 → 4634.56] you can tell the way Linus,
[4634.60 → 4638.74] his staff talks about money that he's like such a miser and like that.
[4638.82 → 4640.02] There's a ton of pressure on them.
[4640.02 → 4640.50] And they're like,
[4640.52 → 4643.96] they're trying to read these like psychological cues on people's faces.
[4643.96 → 4645.10] And you're just sitting here going like,
[4645.20 → 4645.32] yeah.
[4645.32 → 4646.46] Cause if that was the case,
[4646.48 → 4647.62] we'd let that go through editing.
[4647.62 → 4648.02] Like,
[4648.10 → 4648.32] yeah.
[4648.32 → 4648.84] Like if we,
[4648.92 → 4649.60] if we were that,
[4649.72 → 4650.80] if there was that much corruption,
[4650.80 → 4652.24] it just wouldn't show up on the camera.
[4652.38 → 4652.68] And I would,
[4652.78 → 4653.24] and I would,
[4653.30 → 4654.36] and I would sign the
[4654.46 → 4655.38] I would sign the
[4655.44 → 4655.64] the
[4655.64 → 4656.56] the purchase approval.
[4656.78 → 4657.02] Yeah.
[4657.36 → 4657.72] Like,
[4657.80 → 4658.40] what are you talking about?
[4658.42 → 4659.28] Do you think?
[4659.90 → 4660.96] Have some game sense.
[4661.08 → 4661.20] But,
[4661.24 → 4661.42] but,
[4661.42 → 4662.70] but there's a significant,
[4662.80 → 4666.44] there's a significant enough portion of the audience that we just,
[4666.64 → 4667.54] like,
[4667.56 → 4668.30] we can't,
[4668.30 → 4668.66] uh,
[4668.74 → 4669.28] like the
[4669.28 → 4670.86] the L is for narcissist thing.
[4671.30 → 4671.70] Yeah.
[4672.02 → 4672.42] Hilarious.
[4672.56 → 4673.00] I don't think,
[4673.10 → 4674.76] I don't think it would make it into the edit today.
[4675.28 → 4675.90] But the
[4675.90 → 4678.96] the problem is that it is like it did.
[4679.48 → 4681.68] And then people took it super,
[4681.82 → 4682.04] super,
[4682.16 → 4683.00] super seriously.
[4685.58 → 4686.60] Like what do you think happened?
[4686.70 → 4687.16] Like once it,
[4687.24 → 4687.58] once it,
[4687.58 → 4689.38] once it gets ingested into the camera,
[4689.44 → 4691.20] it just like must show up on YouTube.
[4691.40 → 4691.92] And then what's,
[4692.02 → 4692.82] what's hilarious.
[4693.04 → 4699.78] What's hilarious to me about it is that a joke like that is allowed in the video.
[4700.02 → 4704.56] And then people still are under the impression that I'm some kind of thin skin.
[4704.90 → 4705.30] Draconian.
[4705.30 → 4708.14] And I'm kind of sitting here going like,
[4709.52 → 4710.46] when did humour.
[4710.46 → 4710.80] He thought it was funny.
[4710.88 → 4711.72] Because it was funny.
[4711.92 → 4712.16] It was,
[4712.22 → 4712.58] it was a good,
[4712.60 → 4713.16] it was a good joke.
[4713.22 → 4713.36] Good,
[4713.40 → 4713.82] good joke.
[4713.94 → 4714.26] Yeah.
[4714.38 → 4714.72] When did,
[4714.78 → 4718.02] when did humour become such a serious thing?
[4718.28 → 4718.54] I,
[4718.60 → 4718.82] I,
[4718.88 → 4720.30] I had never even seen it.
[4720.54 → 4722.70] And then it like came up some,
[4722.76 → 4726.08] I was talking to Dan or something, and it came up when I went back and watched it and just,
[4726.32 → 4729.24] it immediately got me hard.
[4729.24 → 4730.20] I burst out laughing.
[4730.20 → 4731.38] It was hilarious.
[4731.66 → 4732.70] The delivery on it was great.
[4732.80 → 4733.54] It was hilarious.
[4733.82 → 4734.28] Very funny.
[4735.42 → 4736.18] And then it just,
[4736.34 → 4736.48] yeah,
[4736.54 → 4738.22] people just take it like a billion miles.
[4738.22 → 4741.68] And like the very best sort of,
[4741.74 → 4742.20] um,
[4742.56 → 4749.98] I'd say I appreciate a dry cutting joke and like the very best cutting jokes.
[4750.72 → 4751.20] Yeah.
[4751.22 → 4752.48] There's a little bit of truth in it.
[4752.60 → 4752.70] Sure.
[4752.90 → 4755.42] I think to be a YouTuber,
[4755.60 → 4757.58] I think to be a social media personality,
[4757.58 → 4761.12] you don't necessarily have to be to a disordered level,
[4761.12 → 4762.94] but like anything,
[4763.60 → 4763.90] you know,
[4763.98 → 4773.32] self-absorption is going to be on a spectrum, and you have to obviously reach a point where you make a binary decision.
[4773.66 → 4776.48] Some degree of it's all about me to put your face on camera.
[4776.62 → 4777.18] Exactly.
[4777.50 → 4779.90] You reach this decision point where you go,
[4780.34 → 4787.56] I should talk about myself on the internet and other people should find it interesting.
[4787.58 → 4789.44] I can make a career out of this.
[4789.94 → 4790.42] Exactly.
[4791.12 → 4792.32] People should,
[4792.90 → 4800.64] people should be supportive of my efforts to talk about my damn self on the internet.
[4801.00 → 4801.14] Right?
[4801.24 → 4803.68] Like there has to be a little bit of that.
[4803.68 → 4805.88] And there's also the self-awareness of that too.
[4806.56 → 4807.14] But like,
[4807.22 → 4807.44] it's like,
[4807.52 → 4808.26] I don't know.
[4808.36 → 4808.46] I,
[4808.60 → 4809.26] but I don't,
[4809.44 → 4809.82] I don't,
[4809.98 → 4811.22] I don't think people,
[4811.40 → 4812.00] it's funny.
[4812.00 → 4814.82] I don't think people necessarily,
[4814.82 → 4816.88] necessarily see that.
[4816.96 → 4818.14] I think I've talked about this on the
[4818.14 → 4823.26] I think I've talked about this on the WAN show before where I will often joke about saying,
[4823.38 → 4824.64] do you even know who I am?
[4825.00 → 4827.34] Because what's funny to me is that,
[4827.34 → 4828.00] no,
[4828.08 → 4828.76] they don't.
[4829.22 → 4832.02] The vast majority of people do not.
[4832.12 → 4832.80] I am not.
[4832.86 → 4834.34] You're not specifically into computers.
[4834.54 → 4834.70] It's like,
[4834.70 → 4835.52] I am not Mr.
[4835.62 → 4835.96] Beast.
[4836.14 → 4836.38] Yeah.
[4836.38 → 4843.90] Like I could walk into the average high school and if I happen to be walking past the computer lab when the bell rings,
[4844.08 → 4845.96] I'm going to get a couple of those.
[4846.54 → 4847.44] But that is,
[4847.56 → 4849.38] that is not the level of fame that I have.
[4849.40 → 4851.00] And if I get a speeding ticket,
[4851.00 → 4851.72] for example,
[4852.26 → 4852.68] no,
[4852.98 → 4858.62] I am not going to be getting out of my speeding ticket because people like my fucking tech tips.
[4859.00 → 4861.04] That is actually not how this works.
[4861.58 → 4862.78] That's the joke.
[4863.88 → 4865.46] Do you even know who I am?
[4865.46 → 4866.74] No.
[4867.64 → 4869.30] And we're both in on it.
[4871.46 → 4871.86] But,
[4872.02 → 4876.56] but that seems to have become a narrative about me in certain circles.
[4876.56 → 4877.38] And I'm just like,
[4877.80 → 4879.56] all right,
[4880.06 → 4881.34] sure.
[4882.50 → 4882.94] Wait,
[4883.02 → 4883.22] what?
[4883.28 → 4884.68] You can't get out of speeding tickets?
[4885.24 → 4885.62] No,
[4885.76 → 4886.58] believe it or not,
[4886.62 → 4891.66] I have never successfully gotten out of a speeding ticket by being me.
[4891.66 → 4893.58] And before you ask,
[4893.70 → 4894.10] no,
[4894.18 → 4896.26] I've never brought up that I am me.
[4896.78 → 4897.82] It'd be hilarious.
[4897.84 → 4899.24] Because it would not matter.
[4899.66 → 4901.04] If I was in the passenger seat,
[4901.10 → 4901.78] it would be hilarious.
[4902.36 → 4902.56] Like,
[4902.62 → 4902.90] I'm just,
[4903.00 → 4904.68] I'm imagining this right now.
[4904.68 → 4906.68] Uh,
[4906.76 → 4906.96] hi,
[4907.04 → 4907.20] yeah,
[4907.24 → 4907.44] hi,
[4907.50 → 4907.86] officer.
[4908.48 → 4908.84] Uh,
[4909.20 → 4909.74] I mean,
[4910.82 → 4912.88] surely we can come to an understanding here.
[4913.06 → 4913.08] Like,
[4913.14 → 4913.28] do you,
[4913.34 → 4913.68] what if I,
[4913.68 → 4915.20] what if I put you in the credits for the next video?
[4915.20 → 4915.52] Yeah.
[4915.60 → 4915.86] Do you,
[4915.94 → 4916.18] do you,
[4916.28 → 4917.12] do you know,
[4917.42 → 4918.28] do you know this face?
[4918.36 → 4918.60] Do you,
[4918.70 → 4919.74] do you know who I am?
[4920.20 → 4920.56] No,
[4920.80 → 4921.06] no.
[4921.06 → 4921.38] Okay.
[4922.04 → 4922.40] Okay.
[4922.64 → 4924.60] You got a tech-savvy nephew.
[4924.98 → 4926.34] You got a tech-savvy nephew.
[4926.64 → 4927.56] Can you call him really quick?
[4927.58 → 4928.04] Call him up.
[4928.62 → 4931.42] Tell him who you got in the car right here and then tell me you're still getting me.
[4931.42 → 4931.96] I mean,
[4932.16 → 4932.88] come on.
[4933.80 → 4934.58] Then again,
[4934.84 → 4935.40] then again,
[4936.00 → 4936.98] back to the whole,
[4937.14 → 4938.72] what's real and what's not.
[4939.28 → 4944.28] It's not like we don't see TikToks and YouTube videos day in,
[4944.46 → 4947.66] day out of people actually behaving like that.
[4947.94 → 4948.16] Yeah.
[4948.66 → 4949.28] But that's,
[4949.28 → 4951.04] so,
[4951.16 → 4952.30] so I don't blame people.
[4952.82 → 4953.22] No,
[4953.34 → 4953.50] no,
[4953.56 → 4954.18] really though.
[4954.60 → 4956.28] It's not unbelievable.
[4956.46 → 4957.66] They don't know me personally.
[4958.56 → 4960.88] They don't observe me in my daily life.
[4961.00 → 4961.66] This is fair.
[4962.44 → 4966.00] I'm still allowed to be annoyed that we can't make jokes.
[4967.12 → 4967.62] Oh yeah,
[4967.66 → 4968.00] me too.
[4968.14 → 4968.32] Both,
[4968.32 → 4969.20] both sides are fair.
[4969.32 → 4969.46] I think,
[4969.52 → 4972.90] I think we can be annoyed that we can't make jokes, and we can understand why.
[4973.06 → 4973.26] Dude,
[4973.26 → 4973.74] it's sad.
[4973.88 → 4974.34] I like,
[4974.50 → 4975.16] I like,
[4975.28 → 4978.46] I like playing the role of the
[4978.46 → 4987.94] of the kind of incompetent ignoramus who is discovering something because at some point I didn't know.
[4988.58 → 4991.46] And at some point it was really exciting to learn it.
[4991.46 → 4996.18] And channelling that is one of the easiest ways for me to get amped up about something.
[4996.72 → 4996.98] And,
[4997.08 → 4999.04] and I've always loved.
[4999.18 → 5003.18] And it's not so much of an act because at one point in time you were excited.
[5003.18 → 5003.58] Exactly.
[5003.82 → 5010.04] And I've always loved putting myself in a position to have something explained to me by my on camera,
[5010.04 → 5011.10] uh,
[5011.14 → 5011.42] you know,
[5011.56 → 5012.34] co-host or,
[5012.50 → 5014.70] or by another member of the tech,
[5014.70 → 5016.38] subject-matter expert of some kind.
[5016.42 → 5017.44] Of the tech YouTube space or,
[5017.44 → 5017.92] or,
[5017.92 → 5019.14] or a subject-matter expert.
[5019.14 → 5019.46] I,
[5019.46 → 5022.72] I have intentionally put myself in these positions time and time and time again,
[5022.72 → 5028.06] even though a lot of the time I wrote the damn script.
[5028.32 → 5029.86] Or at least part of it.
[5030.34 → 5030.82] Yeah.
[5031.34 → 5037.34] But people don't seem to understand that the actor is not necessarily exactly who they play on TV.
[5037.34 → 5037.80] And you know what?
[5037.82 → 5039.02] I do make mistakes sometimes.
[5039.20 → 5041.54] And sometimes I make them by accident.
[5042.10 → 5045.06] A lot of the time when I goof is something on camera.
[5045.16 → 5045.30] Yeah,
[5045.30 → 5045.82] it's on purpose.
[5046.02 → 5047.06] I knew it was going to happen.
[5047.06 → 5050.58] Or I knew there was a very solid chance that it was going to happen.
[5050.84 → 5052.74] And I thought it was funny or interesting,
[5052.74 → 5054.54] but I do make mistakes.
[5054.74 → 5062.54] And I think that this is one of those things where I have a family member that often says stuff that is just astronomically stupid.
[5063.54 → 5066.64] And one of the things that he does is he'll do it on purpose.
[5066.80 → 5068.06] Just often enough.
[5069.32 → 5071.60] When he says something really stupid,
[5071.60 → 5072.22] he can say,
[5072.34 → 5072.46] right,
[5072.54 → 5074.48] but I was doing that thing.
[5074.56 → 5076.60] I do where I say something really stupid.
[5077.78 → 5080.24] And so knowing someone like that,
[5080.26 → 5082.42] I can see how people would think it's that.
[5082.48 → 5082.76] But no,
[5082.84 → 5084.54] I'm just a little bit stupid.
[5084.72 → 5085.58] It's the old troll argument.
[5085.88 → 5086.08] Yeah.
[5088.56 → 5089.42] Where people are like,
[5089.58 → 5089.84] just,
[5090.50 → 5091.40] where even is it?
[5091.72 → 5093.46] Where people are just actually a**holes.
[5093.80 → 5094.40] And they're,
[5094.54 → 5094.76] oh,
[5094.78 → 5096.14] I was just trolling.
[5096.58 → 5096.78] Yeah.
[5096.84 → 5099.30] And then they'll like actually troll in like fun ways sometimes.
[5099.58 → 5099.78] Yeah.
[5099.78 → 5100.44] Then every once in a while,
[5100.50 → 5101.68] they'll go like way too far,
[5101.76 → 5103.18] but then just try to fall back on the excuse.
[5103.30 → 5103.54] And it's like,
[5103.66 → 5103.78] no,
[5103.90 → 5105.20] you're actually just a loser.
[5105.54 → 5105.68] Yeah.
[5105.80 → 5105.96] Yeah.
[5105.96 → 5108.26] You're just actually mean and people don't like you.
[5108.30 → 5109.32] No one wants you to be around.
[5110.28 → 5110.78] Got him.
[5112.46 → 5113.94] What are we even supposed to be talking about right now?
[5113.94 → 5115.36] I was just going to ask that.
[5115.44 → 5115.70] Nice.
[5116.26 → 5116.34] Uh.
[5119.32 → 5119.64] Okay.
[5119.64 → 5120.40] Let's do a topic.
[5120.62 → 5121.10] Switch two?
[5121.20 → 5121.86] What do you guys want to hear about?
[5121.90 → 5122.04] Yeah.
[5122.12 → 5122.26] Let's,
[5122.82 → 5123.22] I mean,
[5123.32 → 5125.92] is announcing that you're going to have an announcement,
[5125.92 → 5127.62] but you're not going to announce what you're announcing.
[5127.70 → 5128.72] Is that even newsworthy?
[5128.94 → 5129.46] There is.
[5129.56 → 5129.76] Fine.
[5129.76 → 5130.80] There is supplier leaks.
[5130.80 → 5131.06] So,
[5131.14 → 5131.26] okay.
[5131.68 → 5135.54] Nintendo announced that it will be announcing the successor to the switch.
[5135.54 → 5137.74] So we need to discuss what we think it might be called,
[5137.74 → 5138.28] uh,
[5138.28 → 5139.78] within this fiscal year,
[5139.78 → 5141.62] which means by the end of March,
[5141.62 → 5143.28] 2025.
[5143.98 → 5144.34] Oh,
[5144.64 → 5145.34] fiscal year.
[5145.40 → 5145.54] Yeah.
[5145.58 → 5145.84] Okay.
[5146.08 → 5152.08] Nintendo has also said that their June Nintendo direct will focus on titles for the current console set.
[5152.08 → 5153.28] Oh,
[5153.36 → 5155.58] set to come out on the second half of the year.
[5156.16 → 5156.72] Paper launch?
[5156.98 → 5157.30] Question mark.
[5157.58 → 5164.12] The company president recently told investors that it's not including switch to sales, and it's forecast for the same period,
[5164.50 → 5167.52] implying the console will launch sometime after the end of March.
[5168.06 → 5171.48] A recent massive spec leak based on shipping manifests,
[5171.84 → 5173.74] which is usually a pretty solid,
[5173.74 → 5176.42] pretty solid one indicator of what it will actually be,
[5176.42 → 5176.88] uh,
[5176.88 → 5181.18] indicated that the console features 12 gigs of LPDDR5X memory.
[5181.30 → 5181.88] It's pretty aggressive.
[5182.08 → 5183.58] On the memory side.
[5183.66 → 5183.90] Yeah.
[5184.60 → 5189.16] 256 gigs of UFS 3.1 storage and an eight-inch display.
[5189.16 → 5190.16] The switch OLED,
[5190.38 → 5190.84] for example,
[5190.84 → 5196.44] is seven inches and an NVIDIA Terra 23.9.
[5197.66 → 5201.00] Same one spotted in many past switch to leaks,
[5201.10 → 5206.50] which is the slightly sad part for me because some of these leaks for this processor are old.
[5207.24 → 5207.64] Yeah.
[5207.80 → 5209.36] It's Ampere based is,
[5209.36 → 5209.74] uh,
[5209.76 → 5211.06] is my understanding of it,
[5211.06 → 5212.60] but Ampere is okay.
[5213.30 → 5214.38] Ampere and,
[5214.48 → 5217.60] and my understanding again is that it's not pure Ampere.
[5217.82 → 5219.68] So I think some of the stuff is newer.
[5219.82 → 5221.10] Like it might have newer,
[5221.10 → 5222.44] newer AI stuff.
[5222.44 → 5222.80] So,
[5222.80 → 5226.16] so the upscaling on this thing might be awesome.
[5226.26 → 5226.82] Pretty good.
[5226.86 → 5229.82] And when you consider in Nintendo's typical,
[5229.82 → 5230.68] uh,
[5230.68 → 5231.90] visual style,
[5232.98 → 5235.44] upscaling should work really well.
[5236.10 → 5237.74] I like skipped 3000 series.
[5237.82 → 5239.24] Do they have DLSS specifically?
[5239.40 → 5239.54] Yeah.
[5240.38 → 5240.56] Yeah.
[5240.64 → 5241.58] 2000 series.
[5241.78 → 5242.24] Cause that's,
[5242.32 → 5243.98] that's like the future of all the things.
[5244.06 → 5247.90] 2000 series was when they introduced all the AI stuff and ray tracing stuff.
[5248.10 → 5249.14] Got more refined with 3000.
[5249.14 → 5251.50] And then 3000 series was when it got usable.
[5251.82 → 5252.02] Yeah.
[5252.14 → 5252.54] Um,
[5253.54 → 5256.68] so you wanted to talk about naming for this.
[5256.86 → 5257.16] Yeah.
[5257.32 → 5257.72] Why?
[5258.12 → 5261.46] Because Nintendo's pulled some weird stuff out in the past.
[5261.46 → 5261.68] Oh,
[5261.68 → 5262.18] I see.
[5262.26 → 5263.10] So is it going to be like,
[5263.26 → 5263.48] we,
[5263.60 → 5263.82] we,
[5263.82 → 5264.26] you,
[5264.26 → 5265.14] or,
[5265.14 → 5266.58] or there's been some like,
[5266.68 → 5267.76] Nest to super nest.
[5267.94 → 5268.16] Yes.
[5268.16 → 5269.54] Stuff where they had like,
[5270.16 → 5271.54] they literally called one of them new.
[5271.98 → 5272.38] Yeah.
[5272.38 → 5272.76] That was,
[5272.90 → 5273.62] that was weird,
[5273.74 → 5273.92] dude.
[5274.02 → 5274.50] So like they,
[5274.50 → 5276.44] they've really pulled some stuff out.
[5276.50 → 5276.78] So like,
[5276.78 → 5278.52] is this the new switch?
[5278.68 → 5278.92] Yeah.
[5278.92 → 5279.42] That's funny.
[5279.54 → 5281.60] We make fun of Microsoft a lot.
[5281.84 → 5283.30] Nintendo's like way worse.
[5283.48 → 5284.62] And I don't know about worse,
[5284.68 → 5286.70] but they're definitely equally bad.
[5287.00 → 5288.70] Can we agree they're equally bad?
[5288.78 → 5289.00] Yes.
[5289.36 → 5289.66] Okay.
[5289.88 → 5290.06] Yeah.
[5290.10 → 5290.42] We agree.
[5290.50 → 5291.32] They're equally bad.
[5291.32 → 5291.90] I just,
[5292.00 → 5295.86] the reason why I said way worse is I had flashbacks to nom of the Wii U launch.
[5295.96 → 5297.38] Like some of its kind of made sense.
[5297.46 → 5300.34] Like the Game Boy Advance is definitely better than a Game Boy.
[5300.92 → 5302.60] And it's like kind of Game Boy like.
[5302.72 → 5303.92] Game Boy SP was weird.
[5304.04 → 5304.16] Yeah.
[5304.26 → 5305.96] DS Lite made sense.
[5306.70 → 5307.18] Sort of.
[5308.34 → 5308.74] Yeah.
[5308.98 → 5311.16] Wasn't it actually like a performance jump as well?
[5311.80 → 5312.16] Um,
[5312.56 → 5313.30] I don't remember,
[5313.46 → 5313.94] but it was lighter.
[5314.42 → 5315.70] But it was L-I-T-E.
[5315.96 → 5316.22] Yeah.
[5316.42 → 5316.66] Yeah.
[5317.14 → 5317.42] You know,
[5317.50 → 5317.76] light.
[5318.88 → 5319.08] Yeah.
[5319.96 → 5320.52] Like there's.
[5320.52 → 5321.50] I wasn't a huge fan of that one.
[5321.52 → 5323.46] Because I thought it was like actually a.
[5323.52 → 5324.36] 3DS made sense.
[5324.48 → 5325.38] 3DS was pretty good.
[5325.58 → 5325.64] DS,
[5325.74 → 5326.38] but 3D.
[5326.56 → 5327.54] 3DS was pretty good.
[5327.64 → 5328.02] Um,
[5328.68 → 5329.22] 2 Switch,
[5329.32 → 5330.04] 2 Furious,
[5330.42 → 5331.38] says nil pointer.
[5332.06 → 5332.58] We could,
[5332.64 → 5332.74] yeah,
[5332.78 → 5334.78] we could just let chat help us out here.
[5335.42 → 5335.58] Uh,
[5335.58 → 5337.28] Switch Pro would be interesting.
[5337.42 → 5338.08] Switch Advance.
[5338.54 → 5339.90] I'd be down for Switch Advance.
[5340.12 → 5340.54] I'd be,
[5340.62 → 5341.84] I would also be down with Switch Advance.
[5341.86 → 5342.36] It's a Switch,
[5342.46 → 5344.84] but it's with more Switch than ever before.
[5344.98 → 5345.36] I'd be,
[5345.36 → 5346.16] I'd be into that.
[5346.72 → 5347.36] Switch Up.
[5347.36 → 5347.80] Switch Up.
[5347.80 → 5348.50] I mean,
[5348.68 → 5349.02] you know,
[5349.12 → 5350.14] with the whole like,
[5350.22 → 5350.54] you know,
[5350.54 → 5351.40] I think Switch Up.
[5351.74 → 5354.30] I'm pretty sure I've seen people say Switch Up before.
[5354.30 → 5355.82] Switch to Electric Boogaloo.
[5356.28 → 5356.64] I mean,
[5356.66 → 5358.36] these are perfect Switch.
[5358.54 → 5358.86] I mean,
[5359.12 → 5361.82] okay,
[5362.08 → 5364.18] I think Float plane Chat is going to lose their,
[5364.18 → 5365.94] lose their chatting privileges pretty quickly.
[5366.00 → 5366.70] Who do you think you are?
[5366.76 → 5367.32] Twitch Chat?
[5367.90 → 5369.32] Some people have been saying Super Switch.
[5369.54 → 5370.32] Uber Switch.
[5371.20 → 5372.02] Switch Hitter.
[5372.02 → 5375.84] Switch HD.
[5376.36 → 5376.86] I mean,
[5377.22 → 5377.58] no,
[5377.68 → 5378.26] no.
[5379.20 → 5379.36] Oh,
[5379.54 → 5379.56] well,
[5379.66 → 5380.30] yeah,
[5380.38 → 5380.58] no.
[5380.76 → 5382.88] Nobody would use HD branding today.
[5382.98 → 5383.34] Not anymore.
[5383.54 → 5383.66] Yeah.
[5383.72 → 5385.40] HD branding is like,
[5385.66 → 5386.80] I don't know,
[5386.82 → 5387.88] 15 years ago.
[5388.10 → 5388.38] Yeah.
[5388.74 → 5388.96] Yeah.
[5389.56 → 5391.04] And people are saying Switch 4K.
[5391.46 → 5391.68] There's,
[5391.78 → 5392.06] I don't,
[5392.14 → 5393.50] I don't think this is going to be,
[5393.62 → 5395.44] it could be a 4K console.
[5396.46 → 5396.60] If,
[5396.82 → 5396.98] I doubt it.
[5397.10 → 5397.52] Well,
[5397.90 → 5398.46] hold on.
[5398.88 → 5399.74] If Nintendo,
[5401.00 → 5401.84] as rumoured,
[5402.02 → 5404.30] has backwards compatibility with Switch games,
[5404.80 → 5411.80] I see no reason why an Ampere based GPU with upscaling couldn't run something like Tears of the Kingdom at 4K.
[5412.58 → 5417.06] But with the added expense of a 4K screen.
[5417.22 → 5417.36] No,
[5417.40 → 5418.42] it won't have a 4K screen.
[5418.72 → 5418.96] Oh.
[5419.42 → 5420.94] But it'll be able to do 4K to an
[5420.96 → 5421.14] yeah,
[5421.28 → 5422.16] 4K to an external screen.
[5422.16 → 5423.12] So you could dock it and go to a TV.
[5423.12 → 5426.34] And there is absolutely no reason it shouldn't support HDMI 2.0.
[5426.34 → 5426.94] That'd be fair enough.
[5426.94 → 5427.34] Yeah,
[5427.42 → 5428.04] exactly.
[5428.22 → 5428.46] So,
[5428.70 → 5430.68] I thought you meant on device 4K.
[5431.06 → 5431.50] No.
[5431.50 → 5432.74] I don't think that makes any sense.
[5432.74 → 5433.92] There's absolutely no way they would do that.
[5433.98 → 5435.68] I think it's going to be 1080p on device.
[5435.98 → 5436.20] Yeah.
[5436.62 → 5437.22] Switch X?
[5437.22 → 5437.64] Even that,
[5437.70 → 5438.14] maybe not.
[5439.12 → 5440.14] Switch on?
[5440.54 → 5440.90] Oh,
[5441.32 → 5441.86] I hope not.
[5442.04 → 5442.74] That'd be awful.
[5443.24 → 5443.86] Switch up,
[5443.92 → 5444.68] I'm okay with.
[5445.90 → 5448.14] What was the other one that we both liked?
[5448.28 → 5448.90] Switch Advance.
[5449.02 → 5449.68] Switch Advance is good.
[5449.68 → 5450.52] There's no way they'll do that.
[5450.60 → 5451.00] Nintendo,
[5451.54 → 5452.62] almost to a fault,
[5452.86 → 5453.70] doesn't look back.
[5455.14 → 5455.38] Yeah.
[5455.38 → 5456.54] Like they rarely,
[5457.84 → 5458.36] like there's,
[5458.44 → 5458.56] there,
[5458.64 → 5461.12] like there is no way they'd be like Super Switch.
[5462.54 → 5464.30] One thing that's interesting to me is,
[5464.40 → 5468.72] it's almost certainly going to look almost exactly the same as the Switch.
[5469.14 → 5470.18] It'll be slightly bigger,
[5470.44 → 5471.80] but it's probably going to be more or less the same thing.
[5471.80 → 5471.94] Man,
[5471.98 → 5473.44] if it's more or less the same size,
[5473.50 → 5475.00] but it has an eight-inch screen in it,
[5475.06 → 5476.22] that thing's going to be sick.
[5476.34 → 5476.94] I've heard,
[5477.00 → 5478.62] I've heard rumour that the
[5478.62 → 5478.86] the
[5478.86 → 5480.34] the controller's going to be magnetic.
[5480.62 → 5481.28] That'd be kind of cool.
[5481.28 → 5482.06] It's interesting.
[5482.82 → 5489.60] But this is interesting to me because the jump from the Game Cube to the Wii U was like,
[5489.76 → 5490.02] or sorry,
[5490.10 → 5491.30] the Wii was fascinating.
[5491.50 → 5498.76] And then the Wii to the Wii U was more of an interesting jump than people really realized with the like whole fifth controller and controller with the screen,
[5498.84 → 5499.40] all that kind of stuff.
[5499.48 → 5503.66] And then the Wii U to the Switch was like crazy.
[5504.14 → 5504.54] Yeah.
[5504.58 → 5506.96] And then if this is just like that thing again,
[5506.96 → 5508.02] but with a bigger screen,
[5508.14 → 5509.56] that's like the first time they've,
[5509.68 → 5510.98] will people be really disappointed?
[5510.98 → 5511.90] Really done that.
[5512.20 → 5513.12] Remember too though,
[5513.20 → 5513.54] hold on,
[5513.60 → 5521.08] because the Switch took a unique approach to motion controls that maybe the kinds of games that you play don't take advantage of,
[5521.18 → 5523.10] but there's no way that you could have done the
[5523.20 → 5527.08] what were those cardboard things called where you'd like to put the motion controllers on and stuff?
[5527.16 → 5530.88] Like there's no way that they would have been able to build a gaming experience like that.
[5530.88 → 5531.42] Other than me,
[5531.44 → 5532.74] did anyone care about that?
[5533.16 → 5533.40] I mean,
[5533.40 → 5534.36] I think they sold some.
[5534.58 → 5534.94] Okay.
[5535.94 → 5536.34] Um,
[5536.56 → 5539.02] Gold ball says they should just get rid of the Switch name altogether.
[5539.02 → 5542.20] It is awful to search anything about the Switch on the internet.
[5542.20 → 5543.62] And that is a perfect point.
[5544.14 → 5544.50] Lab.
[5544.72 → 5549.34] The searchability of names is a big problem in insert current year.
[5549.34 → 5550.70] I need to run.
[5550.78 → 5551.36] I'll be right back.
[5553.56 → 5553.96] Okay.
[5554.80 → 5558.52] I just looked up the video I did on the Nintendo Lab.
[5559.16 → 5559.56] Um,
[5559.56 → 5561.96] and this was a lot more recent than I thought.
[5562.04 → 5563.56] It just says five years ago,
[5563.56 → 5566.04] but YouTube's weird with dates sometimes.
[5566.20 → 5566.44] Yeah,
[5566.44 → 5567.30] this was 2018.
[5568.24 → 5568.60] Luke,
[5568.60 → 5569.76] I just got a message in.
[5569.94 → 5570.06] Um,
[5570.12 → 5570.40] Hey,
[5570.54 → 5570.88] DLL,
[5570.88 → 5576.60] why does Nintendo consistently keep bringing consoles out that are almost outdated or many gens behind the current gen?
[5577.26 → 5580.88] They haven't been hardware pushers in a really long time.
[5581.36 → 5585.12] When is the last console they released that was actually like hardware competitive?
[5585.78 → 5587.88] It's never really been about hardware for them,
[5587.94 → 5588.26] has it?
[5588.48 → 5588.72] No,
[5588.80 → 5590.68] I think it was a very long time ago.
[5590.76 → 5590.90] Uh,
[5590.98 → 5591.38] 64.
[5591.76 → 5592.04] Yeah.
[5593.50 → 5593.70] Game,
[5593.80 → 5595.26] was Game Cube hardware competitive?
[5595.42 → 5596.04] I don't think so.
[5596.14 → 5597.32] I think that was pretty underpowered,
[5597.44 → 5597.68] honestly.
[5597.84 → 5598.54] I thought it was.
[5598.82 → 5599.74] I don't really remember,
[5599.86 → 5600.62] but I thought it was.
[5606.40 → 5606.80] Yeah,
[5606.88 → 5607.84] he was pretty strong.
[5608.16 → 5609.98] What directly competed against Game Cube?
[5610.40 → 5611.38] Wasn't it Xbox original?
[5612.06 → 5613.30] It was Xbox and,
[5613.30 → 5614.10] and PS2,
[5614.30 → 5615.26] if I remember correctly.
[5615.98 → 5616.72] Game Cube released.
[5616.72 → 5617.26] PS1?
[5617.26 → 5617.64] Yeah,
[5617.74 → 5618.64] it was PS2 and Xbox.
[5619.62 → 5620.06] 2001.
[5620.72 → 5623.70] Xbox original release date.
[5625.04 → 5625.48] 2001.
[5625.84 → 5626.98] So they're both the same time.
[5628.60 → 5629.86] Xbox versus.
[5637.60 → 5639.38] Do you think it'll do the same dock thing?
[5639.50 → 5640.42] Maybe they'll go to like,
[5640.84 → 5641.14] uh,
[5641.14 → 5644.26] people are saying the Game Cube was impressive because of how small it was.
[5644.38 → 5644.58] Like,
[5644.62 → 5645.20] that's not.
[5645.40 → 5645.94] Is that cool?
[5646.36 → 5647.72] It's not the point I'm trying to make.
[5648.06 → 5648.34] Um,
[5648.34 → 5648.84] but it's,
[5648.92 → 5651.64] at the very least from the Wii forward,
[5651.84 → 5652.24] it's not,
[5652.30 → 5653.74] it has not been about performance.
[5653.74 → 5656.30] And I know that's only a few console generations,
[5656.70 → 5656.94] but,
[5656.98 → 5658.06] uh,
[5658.34 → 5659.68] it's been a long time.
[5659.94 → 5661.74] The Wii release date was 2006.
[5662.46 → 5662.74] Seriously?
[5663.08 → 5666.88] There might be people watching this right now that weren't alive.
[5667.80 → 5668.68] That's depressing.
[5670.94 → 5672.30] At risk of TMI,
[5672.56 → 5673.90] I got my diagnosis back.
[5673.96 → 5674.76] It's just a UTI,
[5674.94 → 5677.82] but I definitely have to go pee very suddenly sometimes.
[5678.02 → 5678.40] That's okay.
[5678.40 → 5680.64] On my antibiotics and I'm feeling a fair bit better.
[5680.86 → 5681.74] At least you're good to go.
[5682.26 → 5682.42] Yeah.
[5682.46 → 5682.88] There was,
[5683.08 → 5684.26] there was blood involved.
[5684.90 → 5685.10] So,
[5685.26 → 5685.38] uh,
[5685.38 → 5686.16] never a good sign.
[5686.18 → 5686.36] Yeah.
[5686.40 → 5687.50] This was like last week,
[5687.54 → 5689.14] right before WAN show started.
[5689.26 → 5690.64] So I was a little stressed during the show.
[5690.74 → 5693.58] This is like kind of the best sign of all the bad signs.
[5694.14 → 5694.64] Oh yeah.
[5694.76 → 5694.96] No.
[5694.96 → 5695.20] I mean,
[5695.20 → 5697.38] the second you start searching for stuff like that,
[5697.46 → 5697.72] it's like,
[5697.84 → 5698.20] yeah,
[5698.22 → 5698.70] you're going to die.
[5698.72 → 5699.38] You're done.
[5699.62 → 5699.78] Yeah.
[5700.04 → 5700.96] Oh Geez.
[5701.24 → 5701.38] Yeah.
[5701.90 → 5702.26] Ugh.
[5702.62 → 5703.20] So that's cool.
[5703.56 → 5703.80] Uh,
[5703.80 → 5704.06] but yeah,
[5704.06 → 5705.52] I don't think they care about performance.
[5705.62 → 5706.10] I think for them,
[5706.12 → 5706.46] it's all,
[5706.46 → 5708.66] it's been all about experience ever since,
[5708.76 → 5709.54] especially the Wii.
[5710.02 → 5710.46] Um,
[5712.46 → 5713.98] and even before then.
[5714.54 → 5715.02] N64,
[5715.16 → 5716.04] they cared about performance.
[5716.22 → 5716.44] Yeah.
[5716.48 → 5716.80] That's what,
[5716.98 → 5717.12] uh,
[5717.12 → 5717.48] what we,
[5717.48 → 5719.54] what we were trying to debate on was,
[5719.66 → 5720.14] did they,
[5720.30 → 5720.50] what,
[5720.56 → 5723.40] what was the argument on Game Cube?
[5724.16 → 5726.26] How was the Game Cube performance wise versus,
[5726.26 → 5727.92] versus PS2 and original Xbox?
[5728.74 → 5729.18] Um,
[5729.34 → 5730.72] I thought it was pretty solid.
[5731.14 → 5731.24] I,
[5731.38 → 5731.74] the
[5731.74 → 5734.70] the looking up that I did was that it was fairly well competing.
[5734.92 → 5735.12] Yeah.
[5735.12 → 5738.00] And gained credit because of how small it was.
[5738.08 → 5738.24] Yeah.
[5738.28 → 5738.80] Which is cool.
[5738.94 → 5741.22] Too bad the discs were too small to put big games on it.
[5741.34 → 5741.56] Yeah.
[5742.20 → 5745.82] So maybe they should have made it bigger and put a proper size disc reader in it.
[5745.82 → 5747.18] And then after the Game Cube,
[5747.28 → 5751.44] they just like actually stopped caring at all about performance.
[5751.56 → 5754.36] And it was much more about experience and just the games that were on the system.
[5754.36 → 5754.62] And,
[5754.62 → 5755.86] and margins,
[5756.06 → 5756.78] walled gardening.
[5757.06 → 5757.98] And margins on the hardware.
[5758.38 → 5758.50] Yeah.
[5759.28 → 5759.56] Well,
[5759.74 → 5762.04] while a lot of other consoles were losing money per,
[5762.04 → 5767.56] I wonder if what they realized was that they were selling so many copies of games that looked like shit for their,
[5767.56 → 5769.00] for their mobile consoles.
[5769.66 → 5770.34] So like,
[5771.20 → 5771.60] realistically,
[5771.76 → 5772.04] if anyone,
[5772.36 → 5772.66] is anyone,
[5772.80 → 5773.94] is anyone caring about this?
[5774.00 → 5775.06] I think also a lot of,
[5775.16 → 5776.02] a lot of like,
[5776.14 → 5777.96] especially first party Nintendo games,
[5778.30 → 5781.10] the art style doesn't demand crazy performance.
[5781.78 → 5782.30] Um,
[5782.30 → 5784.52] and a lot of times the ones that struggle in performance,
[5784.68 → 5784.84] it's like,
[5784.92 → 5785.14] you know,
[5785.16 → 5786.76] they probably could have done better.
[5786.76 → 5787.48] Um,
[5788.00 → 5788.28] so,
[5788.84 → 5789.66] I don't know.
[5790.90 → 5792.42] Does your PC have a handle?
[5792.68 → 5792.94] Dude,
[5793.04 → 5794.06] my brother had this,
[5794.30 → 5796.10] if you don't know what case this is,
[5796.36 → 5797.06] you can,
[5797.74 → 5799.08] let me see if I can find it.
[5799.50 → 5799.84] Uh,
[5799.92 → 5800.36] you're not going to feel to.
[5800.36 → 5801.90] Why don't you look for that while I do our sponsor spots?
[5802.40 → 5802.70] Oh,
[5802.72 → 5803.32] I already found it.
[5805.62 → 5806.22] Alrighty then.
[5806.34 → 5806.50] Oh,
[5806.56 → 5807.78] you have a video on it.
[5808.44 → 5808.80] Nice.
[5809.76 → 5810.56] Let's go.
[5811.52 → 5814.02] I think my favourite thing about my laptop is it has a handle.
[5814.02 → 5816.12] The one your brother has is probably this one.
[5816.12 → 5817.54] It might actually be,
[5817.66 → 5818.62] I'm not sure.
[5818.70 → 5819.40] I don't remember how he got it.
[5819.40 → 5820.56] Cause this is old enough for,
[5820.68 → 5824.50] this is old enough that I probably just wanted to get this thing out of our way.
[5824.98 → 5826.64] And what,
[5826.72 → 5826.88] like,
[5826.92 → 5828.42] I'm going to flip it on Craigslist.
[5829.44 → 5830.64] You scared your cat.
[5831.86 → 5832.66] Like this,
[5832.72 → 5833.00] uh,
[5833.00 → 5835.50] this case would have taken up so much space.
[5835.66 → 5839.72] It would have been more work to sell on Craigslist than it's probably worth.
[5840.56 → 5840.96] Um,
[5841.40 → 5842.98] cause like the price is so high,
[5843.48 → 5844.92] but people don't,
[5844.92 → 5845.96] cases are,
[5846.00 → 5850.10] are one of the fastest depreciating computer components you can buy.
[5850.10 → 5853.32] Like a used case is basically worth half of what it was worth new.
[5853.58 → 5855.70] It was either this one or he is like won it.
[5855.80 → 5857.06] I don't think he bought one of these,
[5857.26 → 5858.82] but at the top there,
[5858.90 → 5861.04] this case was enormous, and it weighed a ton,
[5861.12 → 5862.42] especially once you filled it with stuff,
[5862.48 → 5863.90] especially once you filled it with water cooling,
[5864.02 → 5865.18] absolute clown case.
[5865.18 → 5867.38] and the top here has these metal bars.
[5867.80 → 5868.72] They're actually metal.
[5869.22 → 5877.20] So he had this case, and he got a welder friend to weld the crossbar onto those metal bars so that he could just pick it up with one hand.
[5877.20 → 5879.78] Because he's just this unit that could do that.
[5879.78 → 5880.38] Um,
[5880.38 → 5881.48] and he'd bring it to lands.
[5881.64 → 5883.84] This is just enormous computer.
[5883.96 → 5885.20] They'll just dwarf everything.
[5887.60 → 5888.30] So good.
[5888.58 → 5890.22] I don't know how we got onto the topic of,
[5890.30 → 5890.56] uh,
[5891.84 → 5892.44] cases,
[5892.64 → 5893.40] but we did.
[5893.40 → 5897.12] So basically it's a giant game cube.
[5898.20 → 5899.38] Is that the point you were trying to make?
[5899.44 → 5899.58] Oh,
[5899.64 → 5899.82] right.
[5899.86 → 5902.34] Cause people said you don't have handles on your computers, and I was like,
[5902.42 → 5902.66] well,
[5902.82 → 5904.00] sometimes we weld them on.
[5904.04 → 5905.78] But did people say we don't have a sponsor?
[5905.78 → 5906.74] Because they were wrong.
[5906.94 → 5909.28] The show is brought to you today by AG one.
[5909.48 → 5911.70] If you're already busy juggling your everyday tasks,
[5911.76 → 5915.34] you definitely don't have time to juggle the bottoms of vitamins that you bought,
[5915.42 → 5916.58] but never take.

[5930.24 → 5933.34] our thumbnail designer who drinks it first thing in the morning to start her day.
[5933.42 → 5934.12] That's her right now.

[5948.24 → 5948.80] by the way,
[5948.94 → 5949.20] uh,
[5949.20 → 5949.88] Mother's Day warning,
[5950.00 → 5950.28] everyone,
[5950.50 → 5952.32] when is it this weekend?
[5953.74 → 5954.14] Luke,
[5954.34 → 5955.28] I'm kidding.
[5955.34 → 5955.62] I'm ready.
[5955.76 → 5956.06] Okay.
[5956.24 → 5958.66] It could be part of a good Father's Day gift.
[5958.66 → 5966.04] So try AG one and get a free one-year supply of vitamin D three and K two and five free AG one travel packs with your first subscription at drink.
[5966.04 → 5969.78] AG one.com slash when show we're going to have them linked down below,
[5969.78 → 5971.26] man.
[5971.30 → 5974.56] I got crept up on it a little by it a little bit this year.
[5974.60 → 5976.62] Crept up on by it a little bit this year.
[5976.88 → 5977.14] Yeah.
[5977.14 → 5977.36] Yeah.
[5977.36 → 5977.38] Yeah.
[5977.38 → 5977.70] I was,
[5977.70 → 5979.82] I was freaking out a little bit earlier this week,
[5979.90 → 5982.44] but I actually came up with a perfect thing for,
[5982.98 → 5983.22] um,
[5983.22 → 5983.92] for my wife.
[5984.60 → 5984.92] Um,
[5985.80 → 5986.10] it's,
[5986.16 → 5986.80] it's solid.
[5987.08 → 5987.96] Like actually very,
[5988.04 → 5988.42] you know what?
[5988.42 → 5989.48] She's not going to watch this.
[5990.48 → 5992.28] So people could like Twitter and stuff.
[5992.38 → 5992.60] Careful.
[5992.60 → 5993.40] And they will.
[5993.72 → 5996.10] I don't think she checks her Twitter very often anymore.
[5996.26 → 5996.38] Yeah.
[5996.38 → 5997.62] She's like pretty over Twitter.
[5997.62 → 5998.38] I think at this point,
[5998.48 → 5999.04] nice based.
[5999.20 → 5999.36] Uh,
[5999.52 → 5999.76] okay,
[5999.76 → 6000.02] hold on.
[6000.04 → 6000.92] I'll finish this, and then I'll,
[6001.00 → 6001.88] and then I'll talk about what it is.
[6001.88 → 6004.20] Cause Dan's apparently just not going to cut back to us.
[6004.20 → 6006.18] He's just going to like to leave it on this forever.
[6006.36 → 6008.68] The show is also brought to you by Ridge.
[6009.40 → 6011.20] You might still be sickle,
[6011.34 → 6013.36] but your phone may have found that special.
[6013.46 → 6017.72] Someone Ridge just released their new Meg safe wallet.
[6017.72 → 6019.72] That's compatible with your phone.
[6019.82 → 6023.02] It says Linus quickly shows how it works.
[6023.12 → 6025.54] I assume that this is the Meg safe wallet.
[6025.78 → 6025.88] Oh,
[6026.16 → 6027.60] I was like,
[6027.66 → 6027.82] wow,
[6027.86 → 6028.38] it's light.
[6028.72 → 6029.16] Okay.
[6029.46 → 6029.70] Oh,
[6029.78 → 6029.98] cool.
[6030.06 → 6030.30] Okay.
[6030.30 → 6031.32] So it comes with,
[6031.32 → 6032.84] so you can adapt a little adhesive.
[6033.16 → 6033.66] Oh my God.
[6033.70 → 6034.20] That's really strong.
[6034.28 → 6034.38] Okay.
[6034.58 → 6041.06] It comes with a little adhesive piece so you can just add it to your non-magnetic phone.
[6041.14 → 6043.24] Still chugging note nine,
[6043.50 → 6044.36] for example.
[6044.58 → 6044.74] Okay.
[6044.74 → 6046.24] I'm just going to put it right on the iPhone though.
[6046.36 → 6047.62] And then it's a
[6047.62 → 6047.92] I mean,
[6047.92 → 6048.66] it's a Ridge wallet,
[6048.76 → 6048.92] right?
[6048.94 → 6049.60] So what do you want?
[6049.64 → 6051.88] It's got a band that holds everything together.
[6051.96 → 6053.18] It fits your cards in their like that.
[6053.22 → 6054.60] You pop them out a little something like,
[6054.82 → 6054.94] eh,
[6055.32 → 6056.90] pop them out a little something like that.
[6056.90 → 6061.00] And now it can just stick to the back of your wallet.
[6061.30 → 6062.18] Just like that.
[6062.58 → 6062.74] Oh,
[6062.80 → 6063.02] okay.
[6063.08 → 6065.76] And they've got thoughtful little slippy pads in here.
[6065.86 → 6067.56] So nothing's going to get damaged by it.
[6067.60 → 6068.68] And I mean,
[6068.80 → 6069.10] yeah,
[6069.50 → 6072.62] they better hope nothing goes wrong with this.
[6075.10 → 6075.62] I mean,
[6075.62 → 6079.00] that's not going to get edited at all.
[6082.00 → 6082.40] Well,
[6082.44 → 6082.54] what?
[6082.58 → 6083.40] I'm supposed to stop now.
[6083.44 → 6083.96] I got to finish.
[6085.74 → 6086.10] Anywho.

[6093.16 → 6095.10] And for a stronger hold,
[6095.22 → 6097.16] why not try their strengthening tray?
[6097.74 → 6097.98] Hey,
[6098.04 → 6099.18] maybe you're too cool for an iPhone.
[6099.32 → 6102.96] The adhesive on the back of the tray will allow you to attach your wallet to any device.

[6194.96 → 6195.10] Dan?

[6196.90 → 6197.06] Yeah.
[6197.20 → 6197.64] Then do that.
[6197.88 → 6198.10] Oh.
[6198.96 → 6199.16] Oh,
[6199.16 → 6200.44] is it just like a product placement?
[6200.92 → 6201.12] Yeah.
[6201.12 → 6202.32] And then if you eat it,
[6202.34 → 6202.80] I do this.
[6203.80 → 6204.08] Oh,
[6204.26 → 6204.64] okay.
[6205.48 → 6205.80] Oh,
[6205.88 → 6206.08] sick.
[6206.24 → 6206.44] Okay.
[6206.48 → 6206.60] Well,
[6206.60 → 6207.20] I was waiting,
[6207.62 → 6207.80] man.
[6208.86 → 6209.90] What did you get?
[6210.12 → 6210.74] How dare you?
[6210.80 → 6212.00] How dare you take my bacon jerky?
[6212.22 → 6212.34] This one?
[6212.62 → 6212.76] Yeah.
[6212.76 → 6213.46] I'm going to get the whole thing.
[6213.46 → 6213.62] No,
[6213.64 → 6213.74] no,
[6213.74 → 6213.82] no,
[6213.82 → 6213.92] no,
[6213.92 → 6214.32] go for it.
[6215.08 → 6216.70] I'm trying out the smoke house bacon jerky.
[6216.76 → 6216.86] Well,
[6216.90 → 6217.02] what?
[6217.06 → 6217.50] You don't want to try,
[6217.60 → 6218.58] you only want bacon?
[6218.78 → 6218.96] No,
[6219.04 → 6219.24] I just,
[6219.28 → 6219.74] I just want,
[6219.80 → 6220.50] I just want one.
[6220.60 → 6221.20] You just want one.
[6221.54 → 6222.34] You're just going to have one piece?
[6222.36 → 6223.24] I don't want to open the whole pack.
[6223.46 → 6223.62] Oh,
[6223.66 → 6224.04] that's right.
[6224.12 → 6225.00] Luke's watching his,
[6225.00 → 6225.26] uh,
[6225.30 → 6226.14] watching his intake.
[6226.34 → 6226.68] Thanks man.
[6226.70 → 6227.04] That's fine.
[6227.08 → 6228.44] I'll eat enough jerky for both of us.
[6228.50 → 6228.72] Don't worry.
[6228.76 → 6229.20] I got you.
[6230.82 → 6231.32] All right.
[6231.36 → 6231.62] Anyway,
[6231.78 → 6233.44] let's get on to our next topic here.
[6233.44 → 6233.76] Shall we?
[6233.76 → 6234.32] You want to pick one?
[6234.56 → 6234.72] Oh,
[6234.82 → 6235.24] merch message.
[6235.24 → 6235.44] Sorry,
[6235.44 → 6235.60] Dan.
[6235.96 → 6236.20] Sorry,
[6236.34 → 6236.48] Dan.
[6237.22 → 6238.18] We're doing it.
[6238.28 → 6238.70] There's a sign.
[6239.94 → 6240.26] There,
[6240.26 → 6241.60] there is a sign.
[6241.86 → 6242.98] You guys can't see it,
[6243.04 → 6243.32] but there,
[6243.40 → 6243.98] there is actually.
[6243.98 → 6245.10] If you want to do more topics,
[6245.20 → 6245.30] you can.
[6245.30 → 6245.44] No,
[6245.46 → 6245.58] no,
[6245.58 → 6245.70] no,
[6245.70 → 6245.84] no.
[6245.86 → 6246.32] We'll do a merch message.
[6246.34 → 6247.34] Everywhere there are signs.
[6250.68 → 6250.92] Uh,
[6250.94 → 6251.18] okay.
[6251.50 → 6251.98] It is.
[6252.66 → 6253.10] Uh,
[6253.22 → 6254.70] dead pixel shirt is,
[6254.70 → 6255.28] hilarious.
[6256.10 → 6256.38] Luke,
[6256.46 → 6259.68] what was your biggest hurdle into getting into fitness?
[6259.88 → 6261.78] Mine was being an overweight smoker.
[6262.22 → 6264.46] Have since quit all stimulants.
[6264.76 → 6266.50] Hashtag represent Hartford whalers.
[6267.52 → 6267.74] Nice.
[6267.84 → 6268.06] Oh,
[6268.10 → 6268.32] Hey,
[6268.48 → 6269.16] there we go.
[6269.52 → 6270.04] Um,
[6271.14 → 6271.82] Hartford whalers.
[6271.90 → 6272.26] There's a
[6272.36 → 6275.70] we have a special thing here because Sean from the IT team,
[6275.82 → 6277.66] that's where he got his old screen name from.
[6278.42 → 6280.92] Whalers because of Hartford whalers because of whatever,
[6281.04 → 6281.20] whatever.
[6281.30 → 6281.52] Anyway,
[6281.64 → 6283.22] I thought it was because he murdered whales.
[6284.28 → 6284.60] Nope.
[6284.98 → 6285.48] I'm kidding.
[6285.72 → 6286.08] Fortunately.
[6286.22 → 6286.50] No,
[6286.60 → 6286.90] I'm kidding.
[6286.98 → 6287.70] There's an old Canadian,
[6287.70 → 6290.72] old Canadian hockey team called the Hartford whalers.
[6290.82 → 6290.96] Yeah.
[6290.96 → 6292.04] That's the context for you.
[6292.18 → 6294.64] Not all of them are necessarily going to get the joke,
[6294.70 → 6295.52] which is why I clarified.
[6296.00 → 6296.36] Um,
[6297.74 → 6298.08] uh,
[6298.12 → 6298.52] what was,
[6298.58 → 6298.68] sorry,
[6298.74 → 6299.14] what was it?
[6299.18 → 6300.30] What was the hardest part?
[6300.76 → 6300.98] Yeah.
[6301.00 → 6302.84] What was your biggest hurdle getting into fitness?
[6302.94 → 6303.80] My biggest hurdle,
[6303.80 → 6304.80] uh,
[6305.14 → 6305.90] by fitness,
[6305.90 → 6309.14] I'm going to take that as like the more recent going to the gym stuff.
[6309.14 → 6309.68] Because it's,
[6309.68 → 6311.16] I wouldn't call the more recent stuff,
[6311.24 → 6312.20] me getting into fitness.
[6312.20 → 6312.94] Cause when I was younger,
[6312.94 → 6316.94] I was significantly more fit because I played like a billion different sports all at the same time.
[6316.94 → 6318.00] And I was extremely fit.
[6318.34 → 6318.70] Uh,
[6318.70 → 6319.34] but these days,
[6319.34 → 6321.88] my biggest hurdle was that I was broken in a lot of ways,
[6321.88 → 6324.80] largely from all the sports that I used to play when I was younger.
[6325.00 → 6326.84] So I had rotator cuff problems.
[6326.84 → 6327.54] You shouldn't have done that.
[6327.80 → 6328.52] He's just a boy.
[6328.86 → 6329.32] I was,
[6329.54 → 6332.90] I was on a cane for a few weeks,
[6332.94 → 6335.22] years back because I screwed my knee up so bad.
[6335.22 → 6338.86] So that's a recurring still existent problem that I have.
[6338.92 → 6341.16] And I have lower back issues and all this other type of stuff.
[6341.24 → 6341.90] So I had to,
[6342.44 → 6344.42] and I had gained a ton of weight over COVID.
[6344.74 → 6347.42] So those issues were worse because of the weight gain.
[6347.60 → 6350.40] So I had to drop weight and figure out how to deal with those issues,
[6350.40 → 6354.62] which wasn't the most motivating thing in the world at first.
[6355.46 → 6360.42] But once you start seeing progress in the weight loss, and you start seeing progress in the end,
[6360.46 → 6363.74] the biggest thing for me was progress in the injuries because I had it for a while.
[6363.74 → 6365.20] Like I'm going to do this right now.
[6365.38 → 6368.76] I'm going to reach back and grab Linus's chair and move him around a little bit.
[6368.94 → 6371.10] If I did that a year ago,
[6371.10 → 6373.08] I would have shoulder pain for three days.
[6374.66 → 6377.66] You want to grab something?
[6377.66 → 6379.18] Um,
[6379.18 → 6380.72] because my,
[6380.76 → 6381.56] my rotator cuff,
[6381.68 → 6382.22] uh,
[6382.22 → 6383.26] cuff was so screwed up.
[6383.38 → 6390.84] But as I learned how to do exercises that would help strengthen the rotator cuff and without hurting it,
[6390.84 → 6393.56] which would then make it less prone to injury,
[6393.56 → 6399.72] which would then make it so that I could like reach behind myself and do whatever and not hurt myself.
[6399.72 → 6401.28] Like I can do this now at all,
[6401.40 → 6402.02] which is huge.
[6402.64 → 6403.04] Um,
[6403.04 → 6404.64] Hartford's in Connecticut.
[6405.68 → 6406.66] I had no idea.
[6406.76 → 6409.30] They moved when I was still a kid and I didn't know geography that much.
[6409.36 → 6411.50] I thought the Hartford Whalers were a Canadian team.
[6411.70 → 6412.28] I have no idea.
[6412.82 → 6414.02] I had no clue at all.
[6414.38 → 6414.56] Yeah.
[6414.62 → 6414.84] They,
[6414.90 → 6415.12] uh,
[6415.12 → 6417.56] they moved in 1997 when I was 11.
[6418.28 → 6418.70] So I,
[6418.74 → 6419.06] uh,
[6419.18 → 6421.02] I did not know geography yet.
[6421.10 → 6421.56] That is hilarious.
[6422.38 → 6422.58] Today.
[6422.64 → 6423.16] I learned anyway,
[6423.26 → 6423.40] sorry.
[6423.60 → 6423.96] No,
[6424.00 → 6424.32] it's fine.
[6424.60 → 6425.00] Um,
[6425.12 → 6425.52] but yeah,
[6425.52 → 6425.82] I started,
[6425.88 → 6426.80] I started noticing like,
[6426.88 → 6426.98] Hey,
[6426.98 → 6428.68] I'm not in pain as much anymore.
[6428.68 → 6431.56] That was a huge thing for me by working out more often.
[6431.56 → 6432.48] When I woke up,
[6432.48 → 6435.02] my back wouldn't hurt anymore because I had strengthened my back.
[6435.36 → 6435.64] Uh,
[6435.64 → 6441.92] now I wouldn't sleep on my shoulder funny and hurt it or reach behind myself and grab like a piece of paper and then injure myself.
[6442.04 → 6443.84] Those are more resilient that way.
[6443.90 → 6444.22] I'm,
[6444.30 → 6445.66] I'm not hurt all the time.
[6445.72 → 6446.78] I'm not as tired anymore.
[6446.78 → 6449.68] I just started feeling better and less pain all the time.
[6449.68 → 6451.08] And then now it's just,
[6451.20 → 6453.98] I don't want to stop because those things are very good.
[6454.30 → 6455.24] So I don't know.
[6455.32 → 6456.20] Those were the hurdles,
[6456.20 → 6458.36] but those are also the reasons to do it.
[6458.50 → 6459.60] So good luck.
[6459.70 → 6460.36] I believe in you.
[6462.06 → 6462.46] Sorry.
[6462.48 → 6464.32] I was reminded that the Canucks are playing right now.
[6465.06 → 6465.36] Oilers.
[6465.82 → 6466.04] Yeah.
[6466.06 → 6466.22] Yeah.
[6466.30 → 6466.72] How are we doing?
[6466.94 → 6467.06] Uh,
[6467.06 → 6467.20] one,
[6467.28 → 6468.36] one end of the first.
[6469.20 → 6471.50] I'm suddenly more invested in this than normal.
[6471.84 → 6473.24] Cause you just like the comeback kids.
[6473.74 → 6474.10] No,
[6474.28 → 6476.86] a buddy of mine is like a super fan of the Oilers.
[6477.22 → 6478.78] So I just want him to lose.
[6480.78 → 6481.40] Why do you,
[6481.44 → 6482.34] why do you hate your buddies?
[6482.34 → 6483.70] I heard we won the first game, and I was like,
[6483.72 → 6483.92] yes.
[6484.92 → 6485.40] Oh yeah.
[6485.40 → 6486.78] And an embarrassing fashion.
[6486.84 → 6487.38] We don't have to,
[6487.48 → 6488.74] we don't have to win the whole thing.
[6488.84 → 6489.72] We don't have to win the cup.
[6489.86 → 6490.94] We just got to eat the Oilers.
[6492.08 → 6492.66] Elijah says,
[6492.72 → 6494.58] I can't wait for the Canucks to lose in the finals.
[6494.58 → 6495.80] And we have riots again.
[6496.92 → 6497.86] Three times.
[6498.04 → 6500.50] We're worried about the Vancouver Canucks have never won a championship.
[6501.22 → 6502.14] Three times.
[6502.14 → 6504.32] They have made it to the finals.
[6504.62 → 6506.00] Not just made it to the finals.
[6506.16 → 6507.84] They have made it to game seven,
[6508.08 → 6508.56] which is,
[6508.70 → 6511.14] which is the final game of the best of seven series.
[6511.14 → 6513.62] They have made it to game seven of the finals.
[6513.62 → 6515.44] Three times.
[6515.44 → 6519.70] They have managed to choke in game seven of the finals,
[6519.70 → 6521.24] but never,
[6521.38 → 6522.86] never a championship.
[6523.16 → 6524.52] So I'm,
[6524.60 → 6524.88] uh,
[6524.88 → 6525.02] yeah,
[6525.04 → 6526.10] I'm excited for it too,
[6526.18 → 6526.42] Elijah.
[6527.12 → 6528.22] Going to be exciting.
[6528.78 → 6529.54] It'll be a lot of fun.
[6529.54 → 6534.42] During a panel on AI in the legal field,
[6534.42 → 6539.38] it was stated that using AI may soon be required for attorneys for competency.
[6539.70 → 6544.98] Do you see professions soon requiring AI use rather than doing things manually?
[6544.98 → 6546.42] Well,
[6546.46 → 6548.02] it's not a matter of that.
[6548.02 → 6550.12] I think anyone is going to like,
[6550.14 → 6553.66] I don't think a client is going to come to your law firm and say,
[6553.78 → 6557.76] I need you to use AI, or I am not going to work with you.
[6557.82 → 6557.94] Like,
[6557.96 → 6559.08] I don't think it's going to be like that.
[6559.14 → 6560.84] I think it's going to be more along the lines of,
[6560.94 → 6562.04] if you want to stay competitive,
[6562.04 → 6570.82] then you are going to have to take advantage of the efficiencies that machine learning in its various forms.
[6570.82 → 6571.90] To be clear,
[6572.02 → 6572.20] I'm,
[6572.24 → 6573.84] I'm not necessarily saying,
[6573.84 → 6574.58] um,
[6575.86 → 6576.18] you know,
[6576.22 → 6580.12] AI in the way that I think we're thinking about it right now.
[6580.12 → 6583.14] And that a lot of the stigma is around right now where,
[6583.32 → 6583.50] you know,
[6583.50 → 6588.72] you basically just punch in a prompt, and then it just like shits out a response.
[6588.92 → 6589.40] Uh,
[6589.40 → 6593.80] there's lots and lots of different ways that you can use machine learning.
[6593.80 → 6597.12] So one way would be if you're looking for precedent,
[6597.12 → 6599.04] which is incredibly important,
[6599.04 → 6599.68] uh,
[6599.68 → 6603.00] when it comes to advising your clients on their,
[6603.14 → 6604.58] their best possible defence.
[6604.58 → 6609.12] If you are not searching using an
[6609.12 → 6609.46] uh,
[6609.46 → 6610.14] an AI,
[6610.32 → 6612.82] a machine learning assisted model,
[6612.82 → 6619.76] the entire just astronomically huge library of,
[6619.76 → 6620.44] uh,
[6620.44 → 6622.48] of precedent setting like case law.
[6622.84 → 6623.26] Um,
[6623.26 → 6623.68] if you are,
[6623.74 → 6624.74] if you aren't doing that,
[6625.28 → 6626.26] you're not going to be competitive.
[6626.70 → 6628.04] You're not going to win your cases.
[6628.04 → 6637.84] No human could possibly hope to have read and internalized everything that they would need for every different situation.
[6637.84 → 6640.40] Lawyers lose cases all the time.
[6640.46 → 6642.86] They literally lose as many cases as they win.
[6642.86 → 6643.64] Think about it,
[6643.64 → 6644.34] right?
[6644.86 → 6645.68] For every win,
[6645.98 → 6647.32] somebody has to lose.
[6647.32 → 6651.10] So if you're not using the most state-of-the-art tools,
[6651.28 → 6656.62] your win rate is going to go down compared to people who are using the most state-of-the-art tools.
[6656.76 → 6658.80] Unless they're poorly slashed improperly using it,
[6658.84 → 6659.78] which will happen,
[6659.96 → 6660.78] but which will happen.
[6660.98 → 6662.72] I suspect more often than not,
[6662.78 → 6664.16] especially in competitive industries,
[6664.16 → 6665.10] it will be used properly.
[6665.10 → 6667.86] But I think the example that I'm using where you're using it to,
[6667.86 → 6668.16] to,
[6668.22 → 6669.12] to look for,
[6669.32 → 6670.96] to look for legal precedent,
[6670.96 → 6672.70] I'd say that's a pretty,
[6672.92 → 6680.06] that's a pretty likely use case where it would be very,
[6680.20 → 6682.90] very useful and less prone to hallucinations.
[6683.12 → 6685.88] And it would be better than just a search,
[6686.10 → 6686.32] like a
[6686.32 → 6687.92] like a term search.
[6688.12 → 6693.26] If you have a large language model that has been trained on an enormous data set, and you go,
[6693.26 → 6693.52] okay,
[6693.64 → 6698.32] tell me about any situation where a crime of passion was involved,
[6698.84 → 6701.08] but there were these extenuating,
[6701.08 → 6702.42] extenuating circumstances,
[6702.82 → 6703.02] right?
[6703.04 → 6710.30] Like that's not something that a typical search is necessarily going to be able to handle without spitting you out an enormous number of results that you would have to,
[6710.54 → 6711.62] you have to read through all of them.
[6711.66 → 6711.80] Right.
[6712.78 → 6713.26] Um,
[6714.00 → 6714.68] and I mean,
[6714.74 → 6715.62] I would say,
[6715.72 → 6716.98] I'm not going to name any names,
[6716.98 → 6719.68] but with all the lawyers that we've worked with over the years,
[6719.74 → 6719.94] yeah,
[6719.94 → 6720.86] some of them probably,
[6721.06 → 6722.98] probably should have just used AI.
[6723.26 → 6723.86] For some of the work.
[6724.04 → 6727.50] I have run into examples where way after the fact,
[6727.50 → 6731.64] I realized where they lifted the copy that they sent us from.
[6732.56 → 6735.68] Because I noticed certain verbiage, and I was like,
[6735.68 → 6738.80] I actually literally recognize this.
[6738.80 → 6740.24] And then I go to the
[6740.24 → 6740.64] the
[6740.78 → 6743.68] wherever that legal copy is and see the line.
[6743.68 → 6744.16] And I'm like,
[6744.18 → 6748.72] there's no way there's actually no way this has to be lifted from here.
[6748.80 → 6752.04] And then I'll look at like the formatting of the document and everything.
[6752.04 → 6752.36] And I'm like,
[6752.38 → 6752.52] yeah,
[6752.52 → 6755.06] they just clearly like make it.
[6755.06 → 6756.56] So it doesn't look like you copied my work.
[6756.56 → 6757.68] And then they just copied it.
[6758.06 → 6758.40] It's like,
[6758.50 → 6758.72] well,
[6758.72 → 6759.64] what did I pay you for?
[6759.66 → 6760.36] I could have done this.
[6760.48 → 6760.78] Like,
[6762.06 → 6762.80] especially when,
[6762.98 → 6763.54] when you're like,
[6763.62 → 6763.74] oh,
[6763.80 → 6764.02] well,
[6764.02 → 6765.70] at least it's like signed off by a lawyer.
[6765.70 → 6766.54] So if something goes wrong,
[6766.58 → 6767.08] we can go to them.
[6767.20 → 6767.50] No.
[6768.00 → 6768.40] Oh yeah.
[6768.78 → 6769.22] Man.
[6769.60 → 6770.32] It's all garbage.
[6770.54 → 6771.58] It's funny how,
[6771.72 → 6772.12] you know,
[6772.36 → 6772.88] lawyers,
[6773.38 → 6773.66] you know,
[6773.70 → 6774.56] being lawyers,
[6774.98 → 6775.46] um,
[6776.08 → 6777.14] are pretty,
[6777.50 → 6781.80] they're all pretty knowledgeable when it comes to covering their own asses.
[6782.32 → 6782.70] Um,
[6782.72 → 6784.00] and making sure that,
[6784.32 → 6784.74] I mean,
[6786.10 → 6788.04] I'm just giving advice.
[6788.22 → 6788.68] I'm just,
[6788.82 → 6789.86] I'm just giving advice.
[6789.86 → 6790.02] I mean,
[6790.06 → 6791.38] you could do whatever you want to do it.
[6791.44 → 6791.74] I mean,
[6791.82 → 6792.78] if this goes wrong,
[6792.88 → 6792.90] I'm,
[6793.50 → 6794.78] well,
[6794.84 → 6796.28] what is the point of you then?
[6796.28 → 6797.62] What is your point?
[6797.78 → 6799.64] Why do you actually exist?
[6800.28 → 6800.92] Like if you're,
[6800.96 → 6801.54] if you're not,
[6801.76 → 6802.54] if there's no,
[6802.66 → 6804.08] if there's nothing bad happens,
[6804.08 → 6805.06] if you get it wrong,
[6805.20 → 6807.96] what exactly is your incentive to use you?
[6808.04 → 6808.20] Yeah.
[6809.38 → 6811.98] I am not a huge fan.
[6812.38 → 6812.62] No.
[6813.18 → 6815.14] I think that good lawyers,
[6815.34 → 6817.34] absolutely like any good professional,
[6817.86 → 6818.42] um,
[6818.92 → 6820.62] are important.
[6821.38 → 6821.90] Deeply.
[6822.16 → 6825.90] But there seem to be a lot of less.
[6825.90 → 6826.70] There's a lot of junk.
[6827.36 → 6828.82] Less good lawyers that are,
[6828.94 → 6835.28] that are more motivated by just creating litigation so that they can bill hours.
[6836.18 → 6836.50] Um,
[6836.92 → 6837.14] but,
[6837.28 → 6837.46] yeah.
[6840.04 → 6843.54] I'm trying to get a water block for my 6,900 XT.
[6843.78 → 6843.98] Really,
[6844.12 → 6844.22] Dan?
[6845.42 → 6846.74] Why didn't you just ask?
[6846.84 → 6847.08] Yeah.
[6847.44 → 6848.76] I bet we could have helped you out with that.
[6848.92 → 6849.04] I mean,
[6849.24 → 6851.38] we probably got some EK stuff we can't use.
[6852.50 → 6853.52] Don't say their name.
[6853.52 → 6853.60] Okay.
[6855.90 → 6858.44] I bought one recently and crossed it all the EK stuff.
[6858.54 → 6859.36] I wrote alpha cool.
[6860.12 → 6860.60] Yeah,
[6860.60 → 6861.52] cause that's how that works.
[6862.62 → 6863.98] I did it over the plastic.
[6864.20 → 6865.06] You are the alpha now.
[6865.98 → 6866.78] Sigma cool.
[6868.78 → 6872.68] Oh my goodness.
[6872.68 → 6875.64] So poor Fraser here is trying to find a compatible one.
[6875.90 → 6876.18] Uh,
[6876.18 → 6880.54] is compatibility something that we should be seeing on the lab's website?
[6883.58 → 6884.32] I mean,
[6884.48 → 6885.28] yeah,
[6885.48 → 6887.92] but only to a degree,
[6888.04 → 6888.20] right?
[6888.26 → 6891.16] Because realistically for something like a water block,
[6891.16 → 6893.72] we're not going to test that.
[6893.82 → 6895.12] We're not going to be able to test every,
[6895.14 → 6897.62] there's going to be a lot of things that will actually sort of work on,
[6897.68 → 6900.82] especially with a very minor amount of modification or addition.
[6900.92 → 6904.02] If you like to add little heat sinks to cover the spots that it's not covering
[6904.02 → 6904.32] and whatnot,
[6904.46 → 6907.78] which is something that people have been doing in water cooling forever.
[6908.36 → 6908.72] Um,
[6909.24 → 6909.68] like we,
[6909.74 → 6910.16] yeah,
[6910.24 → 6911.16] what are we supposed to say?
[6911.28 → 6912.72] If you add a few heat sink pads,
[6912.78 → 6913.36] this is fine.
[6913.62 → 6915.22] And back to the question of liability,
[6915.22 → 6915.56] right?
[6915.56 → 6915.76] Like,
[6915.82 → 6918.52] do I want to be in a situation where I say it worked and then the
[6918.52 → 6921.86] manufacturer of the GPU does a silent revision that we don't know about
[6921.86 → 6922.72] and it doesn't work.
[6922.74 → 6923.02] And like,
[6923.08 → 6923.52] like,
[6923.60 → 6923.74] well,
[6923.84 → 6925.80] LTT labs told me it would work.
[6925.84 → 6926.80] And it's kind of sitting here going,
[6926.94 → 6927.18] like,
[6927.24 → 6927.98] why am I even opening,
[6928.14 → 6929.36] opening myself up to this?
[6929.74 → 6930.02] Um,
[6930.04 → 6930.82] I think that's,
[6931.80 → 6934.38] that's something where we're not really going to get into it.
[6934.58 → 6935.60] Like we might have,
[6936.02 → 6936.24] uh,
[6936.24 → 6936.48] we,
[6937.18 → 6937.68] you know,
[6937.72 → 6937.98] if,
[6938.14 → 6940.86] if we were to ever have like a compatibility checker of some kind,
[6940.92 → 6944.84] I think we would probably want to find a way to grab data off of the
[6944.84 → 6946.20] manufacturer website,
[6946.20 → 6949.42] but I don't think that's the kind of thing that we would go through and
[6949.42 → 6950.12] want to validate.
[6950.24 → 6950.36] Like,
[6950.40 → 6951.04] we're not going to,
[6951.10 → 6954.56] we're not going to take a motherboard and put every CPU on the CPU support
[6954.56 → 6955.12] list in it.
[6955.56 → 6957.70] And then maybe other CPUs just to see if they work.
[6957.76 → 6958.28] Like it's not.
[6958.34 → 6960.62] So like literal three people that would care.
[6960.70 → 6960.82] Yeah.
[6960.82 → 6962.22] It's not within the scope of,
[6962.22 → 6963.74] of what labs would be,
[6964.06 → 6965.18] would be able to test.
[6965.22 → 6965.68] I don't think.
[6965.94 → 6966.14] Yeah.
[6969.14 → 6969.96] They could,
[6970.12 → 6971.14] they just shouldn't.
[6972.68 → 6973.54] It's one of the problems.
[6973.70 → 6973.94] Sorry.
[6974.14 → 6974.26] No,
[6974.30 → 6974.42] no,
[6974.42 → 6974.74] go for it.
[6974.74 → 6977.92] It's one of the problems with having a thing like that is like,
[6977.92 → 6978.30] you could,
[6978.42 → 6979.18] you could do the
[6979.18 → 6982.86] the lab could test like practically anything.
[6983.66 → 6984.18] It's like,
[6984.22 → 6984.50] do we,
[6984.60 → 6984.84] do we,
[6984.94 → 6986.30] is that a good use of their time?
[6986.52 → 6990.00] They have so many other really high value things to do.
[6990.00 → 6992.06] And they are currently doing that,
[6992.10 → 6993.34] like adding certain things like that.
[6993.38 → 6993.62] It's like,
[6993.66 → 6994.78] I don't know.
[6995.30 → 6995.48] Sorry,
[6995.52 → 6995.84] keep going.
[6996.32 → 6996.40] No,
[6996.44 → 6996.72] that's okay.
[6996.80 → 6997.66] We'll get one more in here.
[6997.70 → 6997.98] I think.
[6998.46 → 6998.70] Howdy,
[6998.80 → 6999.34] LLD.
[6999.64 → 7003.92] I'm back in graduate school after 20 years in a job where priorities were
[7003.92 → 7004.46] obvious.
[7004.46 → 7009.22] How do you prioritize when the tasks are numerous and deadlines are nebulous?
[7010.48 → 7011.46] I can't.
[7011.54 → 7012.46] I failed in school.
[7012.46 → 7016.88] So you're asking,
[7017.82 → 7018.10] didn't you,
[7018.10 → 7019.36] you said you dropped out,
[7019.46 → 7019.72] right?
[7020.72 → 7021.12] Well,
[7021.70 → 7022.82] it's a little,
[7023.18 → 7023.68] um,
[7024.08 → 7027.70] you were failing, and you just made the conclusion early.
[7028.28 → 7028.80] Yeah.
[7028.80 → 7029.52] I mean,
[7029.70 → 7031.24] it was kind of a
[7031.38 → 7032.22] you can't fire me.
[7032.30 → 7032.80] I quit.
[7033.08 → 7033.46] Um,
[7033.74 → 7035.60] I was on academic probation already.
[7036.10 → 7036.46] Ah,
[7036.80 → 7039.34] and if I hadn't fixed up my grades,
[7039.34 → 7041.28] I would have been kicked out the next semester,
[7041.28 → 7044.44] but I decided that wasn't going to happen.
[7044.58 → 7045.90] Why am I paying anymore for this?
[7045.96 → 7046.56] I'll see you later.
[7046.74 → 7046.98] True.
[7047.20 → 7048.46] I kind of just stopped going to class.
[7048.50 → 7049.96] I never actually formally withdrew,
[7050.34 → 7053.90] which probably looks bad if I ever want to go back.
[7054.18 → 7054.54] Probably.
[7054.76 → 7055.12] Yeah.
[7055.12 → 7057.96] But that would be weird and useless.
[7058.36 → 7058.76] Uh,
[7058.76 → 7061.60] so you're talking to him who has that story and then me who dropped out.
[7062.34 → 7062.78] Um,
[7063.44 → 7065.56] yeah,
[7065.64 → 7066.32] I don't know.
[7066.80 → 7067.48] Task priority.
[7067.56 → 7068.94] Is this specifically for school?
[7069.00 → 7069.38] We're talking,
[7069.48 → 7069.72] or no,
[7069.98 → 7070.18] he,
[7070.34 → 7071.36] didn't he say he just got a job?
[7071.72 → 7072.12] Yeah.
[7072.30 → 7072.60] No,
[7072.62 → 7072.74] no,
[7072.74 → 7072.88] no.
[7072.94 → 7075.32] Wasn't a job for 20 years and now is in school.
[7075.32 → 7077.66] I was in school with no one to basically go,
[7077.78 → 7077.98] okay,
[7078.64 → 7080.82] here's what you're working on right now.
[7080.92 → 7081.58] Do this thing.
[7081.78 → 7084.82] If the way I used to do it was if it's within a certain class,
[7085.94 → 7086.94] um,
[7087.26 → 7087.64] I mean,
[7087.64 → 7089.04] just study everything hard,
[7089.04 → 7090.66] but then if you're,
[7090.74 → 7091.20] if you're like,
[7091.24 → 7091.50] if you,
[7091.56 → 7095.52] if you know rationally looking at the work in front of you that you don't have
[7095.52 → 7096.82] enough time to study everything,
[7096.82 → 7098.32] there's a test coming up.
[7098.32 → 7100.86] If it's when one within one specific class,
[7100.86 → 7103.78] I wouldn't pick the thing that you know,
[7103.78 → 7105.98] the least to try to study.
[7106.12 → 7109.28] I would make sure that you can secure a passing grade.
[7110.24 → 7110.84] So like,
[7110.88 → 7115.98] make sure you're confident in at least a passing grade worth of material and then
[7115.98 → 7117.34] work from there so that,
[7117.42 → 7117.66] you know,
[7117.66 → 7119.44] you can pass the class and keep moving forward.
[7119.54 → 7121.68] So make sure you have a solid base before you go in.
[7121.74 → 7123.48] And then when you get to the actual test,
[7123.68 → 7125.06] find the questions that,
[7125.14 → 7125.32] you know,
[7125.32 → 7128.18] you can confidently answer and blow through all of those,
[7128.18 → 7129.88] like skipping through parts of the test,
[7130.00 → 7133.44] make sure that you like to secure your solid grade that you know you can get,
[7133.44 → 7135.94] and then go back through and try to refine from there.
[7136.04 → 7136.84] That's what I did.
[7136.96 → 7137.90] I have no idea.
[7138.28 → 7139.82] I wouldn't necessarily listen to me.
[7140.18 → 7140.88] That's just what I did.
[7141.14 → 7142.06] Too Como says,
[7142.18 → 7144.40] I was on academic probation at one point.
[7144.54 → 7145.46] This is in float plane chat.
[7146.10 → 7148.52] Now I am a college professor and a scientist.
[7149.24 → 7151.52] I work on gravitational wave physics.
[7151.66 → 7151.96] Sick.
[7152.04 → 7153.94] And I'm smart enough to subscribe to float plane.
[7154.08 → 7155.28] I added that last bit,
[7155.44 → 7155.48] but,
[7155.48 → 7155.60] but,
[7155.60 → 7156.56] but they are subscribed,
[7156.66 → 7157.68] but they are subscribed to float plane.
[7161.06 → 7161.70] That's good.
[7161.70 → 7165.38] I don't think my path would go similarly.
[7165.58 → 7168.22] I don't think I will ever be working on gravitational wave physics.
[7168.74 → 7170.36] I think Luke's seen me try to do math.
[7171.10 → 7172.66] You can do good mental math.
[7172.90 → 7173.10] Oh yeah.
[7173.16 → 7173.26] Yeah.
[7173.26 → 7174.14] I can do simple math.
[7174.32 → 7174.76] Mental math.
[7174.82 → 7175.02] You're good.
[7175.08 → 7175.96] I'm good at approximate.
[7176.56 → 7176.78] Yeah.
[7176.92 → 7178.52] Don't ask me to do anything exact.
[7178.72 → 7181.28] That's almost all you need though.
[7181.46 → 7181.70] You know,
[7181.72 → 7186.52] when I learned that my first year of university summer,
[7186.52 → 7190.60] when I started estimating painting jobs,
[7190.60 → 7194.54] I just like wasn't good at mental math and good skill to have.
[7194.68 → 7196.78] And my regional manager was like,
[7196.86 → 7197.66] well,
[7197.74 → 7203.20] get good because it's realistically the only way that you're going to be able to do this.
[7205.18 → 7206.30] So how'd you get good?
[7206.68 → 7207.26] Just practice.
[7207.72 → 7207.92] Well,
[7207.92 → 7210.34] I had no choice because if I wanted to make money,
[7210.34 → 7214.20] then I had to get good, and I needed to make money.
[7214.20 → 7215.30] Because I had a bunch of,
[7215.30 → 7215.82] um,
[7216.08 → 7217.82] I had a bunch of bills to pay for school.
[7218.02 → 7219.50] So you got good by sheer will.
[7220.24 → 7221.06] I guess.
[7222.18 → 7222.84] Fine enough.
[7223.46 → 7223.82] I mean,
[7223.94 → 7225.08] I think in modern day,
[7225.18 → 7226.12] it was 10% luck,
[7227.02 → 7227.68] 20%.
[7227.68 → 7228.20] Sorry.
[7229.96 → 7230.28] Um,
[7230.28 → 7231.16] I think in modern day,
[7231.24 → 7233.42] if you have good estimation skills,
[7233.58 → 7234.70] good mental math skills,
[7234.78 → 7235.72] the rest of it can be.
[7236.20 → 7241.86] 15% concentrated power of will supplemented through like 5% pleasure phone calculators.
[7242.16 → 7242.96] And if it's complicated,
[7242.96 → 7243.84] 50% pain,
[7244.10 → 7245.30] you can use Wolfram Alpha.
[7245.44 → 7247.22] And a hundred percent reason to remember the name.
[7251.22 → 7252.30] That was all accurate.
[7252.30 → 7252.70] Wasn't it?
[7252.72 → 7253.62] You remembered every lyric.
[7253.88 → 7254.48] Why wouldn't I?
[7254.76 → 7255.78] Doesn't everybody know that?
[7255.94 → 7256.26] Amazing.
[7256.52 → 7256.76] No,
[7256.94 → 7257.72] not off the top of my head.
[7257.72 → 7259.94] I was able to recognize that it was correct,
[7260.56 → 7261.46] but I wouldn't be able to like,
[7261.54 → 7261.94] even now,
[7261.98 → 7263.40] I don't think I could say it all purposely.
[7263.84 → 7264.28] Oh man.
[7264.46 → 7265.00] Is that a song?
[7265.10 → 7265.50] LMAO.
[7265.60 → 7267.30] Elijah causes me pain.
[7267.62 → 7267.76] I know.
[7268.00 → 7269.22] I know he's painful.
[7270.24 → 7270.64] Uh,
[7271.40 → 7272.38] were we doing merch messages?
[7272.52 → 7272.72] No,
[7272.78 → 7273.38] we're doing topics.
[7273.50 → 7273.62] Oh,
[7273.68 → 7273.86] okay.
[7273.92 → 7274.06] Yeah.
[7274.06 → 7274.58] We're doing topics.
[7274.60 → 7275.34] What topic are we doing?
[7275.38 → 7275.72] I don't know.
[7275.76 → 7276.12] Who cares?
[7276.34 → 7276.50] Uh,
[7276.50 → 7279.96] stack overflow users rebel against the site's open AI deal.
[7280.02 → 7280.82] This is hilarious.
[7281.40 → 7286.12] This week stack overflow announced that they would be adding an open AI integration,
[7286.12 → 7289.36] feeding past user contributions to ChatGPT,
[7289.48 → 7294.46] as well as using that information to train AI without consulting their user base.
[7294.84 → 7300.34] Many users responded by deleting or adding protest messages to their past posts.
[7300.98 → 7305.72] Stack overflow staff have reportedly responded by suspending those users on mass,
[7305.90 → 7310.18] then reverting those protest posts to their previous state.
[7310.18 → 7312.18] Oh,
[7312.18 → 7313.18] dang.
[7313.60 → 7314.04] Wow.
[7314.54 → 7319.10] Stack overflow seemed to have a negative attitude toward generative AI previously,
[7319.52 → 7323.38] banning answers written by ChatGPT just last year.
[7323.38 → 7323.50] Oh,
[7323.52 → 7323.74] I mean,
[7323.82 → 7327.60] they probably still have that stance because we know the whole thing where when AI feeds
[7327.60 → 7328.44] off of its own data,
[7328.52 → 7329.04] it gets worse.
[7329.04 → 7329.88] So they don't,
[7330.00 → 7332.82] they don't want generative AI answers on their site.
[7333.26 → 7335.76] They just want to sell their site to AI.
[7336.16 → 7336.52] That,
[7336.58 → 7337.88] that makes complete sense to me.
[7338.30 → 7340.98] You should also just consider stopping using it.
[7341.08 → 7341.98] I'm sure there are alternatives,
[7342.76 → 7343.08] but dang,
[7343.28 → 7343.72] that sucks.
[7343.90 → 7344.74] What are the alternatives?
[7345.00 → 7345.28] No,
[7345.32 → 7345.54] no,
[7345.60 → 7345.62] no.
[7345.62 → 7346.32] Do you guys know?
[7346.54 → 7349.10] Stack overflow has been like the thing for a super long time,
[7349.10 → 7350.20] but this is how,
[7350.28 → 7351.34] this is how you spark competition.
[7351.34 → 7353.52] You know,
[7353.60 → 7355.04] so I'm sure somebody will figure it out,
[7355.04 → 7355.82] man.
[7355.90 → 7356.26] Uh,
[7356.88 → 7358.14] Hero says nothing.
[7358.92 → 7359.32] Um,
[7360.32 → 7364.04] I'm sure someone will figure it out.
[7364.92 → 7365.36] Yeah.
[7365.48 → 7365.84] Reddit,
[7365.94 → 7366.80] but that sucks too.
[7366.88 → 7368.26] And they're definitely doing the same thing.
[7368.46 → 7369.34] The exact same thing.
[7370.18 → 7370.66] Brush.
[7370.74 → 7371.84] I wonder what you do because,
[7372.00 → 7376.18] because we know onsite ads are making effectively nothing these days.
[7376.78 → 7378.50] We're going to like money wise.
[7378.88 → 7379.16] Yep.
[7379.42 → 7381.32] And this type of crowd is just going to be blocking them anyway.
[7381.32 → 7383.90] We've got a fascinating video coming on D Google,
[7384.02 → 7384.84] a fine your life.
[7385.28 → 7385.52] Uh,
[7385.52 → 7388.12] Emily was working on it, and it's pretty cool,
[7388.12 → 7393.14] but it's surprising how many of the alternatives are going to cost you a
[7393.14 → 7393.90] monthly subscription.
[7394.14 → 7394.38] Yep.
[7394.80 → 7395.18] Like it,
[7395.22 → 7397.48] like there's search engines that you can use that don't track your stuff and
[7397.48 → 7398.40] they just cost money,
[7398.54 → 7399.82] but are super cool.
[7399.82 → 7403.84] And you can like to determine your own page rank and stuff and like set your
[7403.84 → 7407.04] own priorities and have no ads in them.
[7407.20 → 7408.82] I've been thinking about going to a paid,
[7408.82 → 7409.50] uh,
[7409.50 → 7410.00] search engine.
[7410.20 → 7410.96] You should watch the video.
[7410.96 → 7411.24] Yeah.
[7411.34 → 7411.54] Yeah.
[7411.60 → 7413.24] Emily put a lot of work into researching it.
[7413.30 → 7413.54] We covered,
[7413.54 → 7414.44] this is actually pretty cool.
[7414.52 → 7414.84] I'm excited.
[7414.96 → 7415.64] We covered browser.
[7415.84 → 7416.82] We covered search.
[7417.46 → 7418.18] Browser too.
[7418.28 → 7418.48] Yeah.
[7418.56 → 7419.26] We talked about DNS.
[7419.80 → 7420.08] Uh,
[7420.08 → 7421.06] we talked about,
[7421.06 → 7421.60] uh,
[7421.60 → 7421.80] man,
[7421.86 → 7425.10] what we're trying to think of what all the D Google,
[7425.18 → 7425.46] a fight.
[7425.54 → 7426.26] We talked about email.
[7426.26 → 7427.26] So we,
[7427.26 → 7427.54] you can,
[7427.54 → 7427.64] you can,
[7427.64 → 7429.70] you can rage about being the product all you want,
[7429.70 → 7431.40] but if you're getting the thing for free,
[7431.40 → 7434.34] there,
[7434.42 → 7434.60] there,
[7434.60 → 7436.92] there's going to be some value harvested somewhere.
[7436.92 → 7437.10] Yeah.
[7437.10 → 7438.46] You don't have a leg to stand on.
[7438.46 → 7438.96] And one,
[7439.04 → 7439.46] one problem,
[7439.46 → 7444.40] one problem is that you don't completely avoid it by paying for things.
[7444.62 → 7445.96] That's one of the big steps.
[7445.96 → 7447.74] Why I haven't done this yet is like,
[7447.82 → 7448.12] okay,
[7448.12 → 7448.48] sure.
[7448.48 → 7451.48] I'm paying for this service, and you're claiming these things,
[7451.48 → 7453.18] but what happens from you changing that?
[7453.18 → 7456.14] What happens this company from being sold to somebody else?
[7456.14 → 7456.82] And now they own it.
[7456.84 → 7460.28] Like what if Google buys this random browser company, and now they have all
[7460.28 → 7460.74] their data.
[7461.26 → 7465.70] These are hopefully things that I can get some amount of information from
[7465.70 → 7465.98] the video.
[7465.98 → 7466.30] So we'll,
[7466.30 → 7466.66] we'll see.
[7467.12 → 7467.52] Um,
[7467.92 → 7468.38] but like,
[7468.42 → 7468.62] yeah,
[7468.62 → 7468.90] there's,
[7468.96 → 7469.18] there's,
[7469.24 → 7469.50] it's,
[7469.60 → 7470.28] it's interesting,
[7470.42 → 7473.76] but it does get kind of expensive to replace all the free things with
[7473.76 → 7474.90] things that cost money.
[7475.00 → 7476.40] And these are ongoing services.
[7476.40 → 7478.88] So it's almost certainly going to be monthly subscriptions.
[7479.06 → 7479.46] Yep.
[7479.58 → 7479.76] Oh,
[7479.78 → 7480.22] a hundred percent.
[7480.22 → 7480.56] One time.
[7480.68 → 7481.10] A hundred percent.
[7481.30 → 7481.50] So,
[7481.68 → 7482.82] and like in theory,
[7482.82 → 7483.34] you know,
[7483.44 → 7487.34] well you could self-host, and we talk a little bit about a Google photos
[7487.34 → 7489.12] alternative that you can self-host,
[7489.26 → 7490.20] which is super cool.
[7490.42 → 7491.52] Even that has costs though.
[7491.66 → 7495.30] But there are a lot of things that even if they don't have a cost,
[7495.34 → 7497.54] don't make sense to self-host.
[7497.90 → 7498.30] Like,
[7498.50 → 7498.78] uh,
[7498.82 → 7500.70] email is one that we brought up as,
[7500.80 → 7502.22] as something that you can,
[7502.32 → 7502.44] yeah,
[7502.46 → 7502.76] look at,
[7502.82 → 7503.78] look at the look on his face,
[7503.84 → 7504.54] the physical pain.
[7504.72 → 7505.70] As someone who runs services,
[7505.70 → 7506.06] like,
[7506.30 → 7506.74] please,
[7506.94 → 7508.02] the amount of times.
[7508.02 → 7508.58] And I,
[7508.74 → 7508.94] I,
[7508.94 → 7511.62] I've tweeted about this a bunch of times back when it was actually Twitter,
[7511.62 → 7514.62] but the amount of times that I have developer applications,
[7514.62 → 7527.28] especially when it comes to infrastructure stuff, and they apply, and they use a custom email and I go to respond to give people interviews and the custom emails just get tossed because deliverability issues,
[7527.28 → 7531.08] whatever else it happens way more than you would think.
[7531.38 → 7534.16] And from people that should know what they're doing.
[7534.50 → 7534.70] Yes.
[7535.24 → 7537.56] The amount of times that people will include a personal site.
[7537.64 → 7541.10] This one sucks because I recommend that people do it.
[7542.10 → 7542.88] Seriously though,
[7543.66 → 7546.00] check if it works before you send in your resume,
[7546.24 → 7546.76] please.
[7547.00 → 7550.36] The amount of people that have included a personal site on their resume that doesn't work.
[7550.36 → 7551.36] Like,
[7551.36 → 7552.10] like,
[7552.52 → 7552.82] bro,
[7553.18 → 7554.72] or like the domain expired.
[7554.84 → 7555.60] I've run into that.
[7555.90 → 7556.64] Like it,
[7556.64 → 7559.42] it would be better for you to not include it on your resume.
[7559.42 → 7561.00] If the domain has expired.
[7561.48 → 7564.88] Then to include it and have someone click a dead link on your resume.
[7565.02 → 7566.30] It just looks like you didn't care.
[7566.50 → 7567.04] But the people,
[7567.20 → 7569.46] people have a non-insignificant amount,
[7569.60 → 7571.30] at least over,
[7571.78 → 7572.72] like we're talking double,
[7572.82 → 7579.90] maybe triple digits of people have lost interviews here because their custom domain email server thing didn't work.
[7579.90 → 7581.76] Or they typed their email wrong.
[7582.62 → 7582.92] Brutal.
[7584.94 → 7585.46] Intel.
[7585.56 → 7585.90] Crazy.
[7586.42 → 7592.16] Rebukes motherboard makers over fixes for Intel's unstable CPUs.
[7592.68 → 7596.94] We've also got some Arrow Lake leaks and AMD stealing CPU market share.
[7597.04 → 7597.84] I just didn't say steal.
[7597.98 → 7598.56] They earned it.
[7598.64 → 7599.08] But anyway,
[7599.08 → 7599.90] that's my headline here.
[7600.48 → 7609.48] After Intel didn't publicly take action concerning recent widespread reports of 14th gen processors causing game crashes and blue screens of death,
[7609.90 → 7611.18] on around April 20th,
[7611.18 → 7615.40] Asus released a BIOS update with an Intel baseline profile,
[7615.52 → 7618.74] which turned down various performance boosting settings.
[7619.56 → 7620.10] This week,
[7620.34 → 7625.46] Intel spoke up to tell users not to use such profiles from motherboard makers.
[7625.46 → 7626.48] Instead,
[7626.48 → 7630.58] Intel wants you to use the Intel default settings profile instead,
[7630.58 → 7634.22] as it involves a combination of thermal and power delivery features,
[7634.22 → 7640.00] with a selection of possible power delivery profiles based on the specific motherboard's capabilities.
[7641.46 → 7642.12] Broadly,
[7642.46 → 7645.82] the motherboard makers profiles did seem to help with the stability issues,
[7646.02 → 7647.72] but it came at a performance cost.
[7648.22 → 7652.84] Intel's guidance seems to be geared towards allowing users to regain some of that lost performance.
[7652.84 → 7656.86] Intel is now demanding that by May 31st,
[7656.86 → 7662.12] motherboard makers release BIOS updates with Intel's default settings profile as the default.
[7662.12 → 7666.30] I can't believe this has taken this long to come to a head.
[7666.56 → 7668.14] But aren't they also saying that doesn't fix it?
[7668.30 → 7670.16] Because the performance,
[7670.78 → 7671.40] what is it,
[7671.44 → 7672.64] multicore enhancement,
[7673.40 → 7675.44] default thing,
[7676.48 → 7677.48] controversy,
[7677.70 → 7678.48] or like conflict,
[7678.48 → 7685.98] between Intel and motherboard manufacturers has been going back for like the better part of a decade at this point.
[7685.98 → 7686.82] And it was,
[7686.90 → 7696.28] it was bound to happen at some point that some kind of performance boosting profile of some sort was going to cause instability.
[7696.76 → 7697.94] Because it all,
[7698.06 → 7700.76] it has always been overclocking to run anything,
[7700.76 → 7704.80] anything but Intel's default behaviour for the CPU.
[7705.62 → 7706.40] And I just,
[7706.54 → 7709.54] I can't believe that it took this long.
[7709.62 → 7709.98] It took,
[7710.10 → 7719.32] it took Intel ending up with egg on their face over the instability of the not Intel default profile for them to finally say,
[7719.54 → 7720.16] look,
[7720.22 → 7722.02] you actually can't do this anymore.
[7722.02 → 7725.08] And I'm willing to bet that this lasts one generation.
[7725.08 → 7730.94] And then immediately in order from other word manufacturers to try to differentiate their product from each other,
[7730.94 → 7737.76] they're going to go back to putting whatever the most aggressive profile they can probably get away with on the majority of CPUs is.
[7737.96 → 7742.40] And we're going to be back to this whole song and dance until this happens again.
[7742.40 → 7747.10] Like there's just absolutely no way that it's not going to just keep happening.
[7747.36 → 7747.74] Oh yeah.
[7747.74 → 7750.34] And to be clear,
[7750.66 → 7751.82] I don't even really,
[7752.00 → 7754.92] I don't even really blame the motherboard manufacturers here.
[7755.62 → 7756.62] Obviously they're going to,
[7756.68 → 7760.06] they're going to push the limits of whatever Intel will allow them to do.
[7760.12 → 7761.72] And they're going to try and differentiate their product.
[7762.12 → 7763.94] I lean toward blaming Intel.
[7764.18 → 7765.02] That's the game they play.
[7765.36 → 7765.62] Yeah.
[7765.70 → 7766.60] If they want to be competitive,
[7766.64 → 7767.32] they have to do that.
[7767.44 → 7767.70] Yeah.
[7767.82 → 7768.66] They're not setting the rules.
[7768.84 → 7769.16] I mean,
[7769.22 → 7770.86] look like it is if,
[7771.00 → 7772.34] if manned,
[7772.34 → 7775.84] if Intel wanted motherboard manufacturers to differentiate their products,
[7775.94 → 7776.10] they,
[7776.10 → 7779.62] they didn't have to consolidate every single function onto the
[7779.82 → 7781.82] onto the CPU and onto the chipset.
[7781.96 → 7782.76] They might've,
[7782.86 → 7786.06] they might've not tried to take all the margin for themselves in the motherboard.
[7786.34 → 7786.72] I mean,
[7786.72 → 7788.00] that was an option to be clear.
[7788.08 → 7790.32] There were performance advantages to some of those moves,
[7790.32 → 7795.88] like moving the integrated memory controller onto the CPU to simplify the motherboard and make it more performant.
[7795.88 → 7798.04] But it's just,
[7798.14 → 7798.96] it's been a
[7799.04 → 7804.64] it's been a trend from Intel for a very long time to squeeze motherboard manufacturers.
[7804.64 → 7807.70] And it's become harder and harder for them to differentiate.
[7808.42 → 7810.06] And so they're going to do what they got to do.
[7810.18 → 7811.58] They got to do what they got to do.
[7811.64 → 7812.88] And if Intel doesn't like it,
[7812.92 → 7813.00] well,
[7813.02 → 7814.42] then they're going to have to lay down the law.
[7814.60 → 7815.82] And if they haven't laid down the law,
[7815.88 → 7816.74] then this is going to happen.
[7816.82 → 7819.28] This is the around and find out.
[7819.36 → 7819.94] It's that simple.
[7819.94 → 7829.34] One can only hope that Intel's upcoming Arrow Lake desktop CPUs won't suffer the same issues on top of having no hyper threading and allegedly terrible names.
[7829.90 → 7830.48] This is,
[7830.60 → 7831.44] this is pretty funny.
[7831.58 → 7831.70] Yeah,
[7831.74 → 7832.22] here we go.
[7832.84 → 7838.22] Next gen desktop CPUs have reportedly leaked Arrow Lake core ultra 200 series.
[7838.68 → 7840.58] Same core counts as Raptor Lake refresh,
[7840.82 → 7841.56] but fewer threads.
[7841.62 → 7841.74] Okay,
[7841.74 → 7842.02] hold on.
[7842.06 → 7842.40] Where's my,
[7842.46 → 7843.02] where's my branding?
[7843.10 → 7843.58] Here we go.
[7844.62 → 7845.28] Uh huh.
[7846.70 → 7847.26] So.
[7848.94 → 7849.34] Um,
[7849.94 → 7852.24] sure.
[7854.12 → 7855.02] I don't know.
[7855.86 → 7856.36] Why is it?
[7857.76 → 7860.04] Why not just,
[7860.36 → 7860.54] I mean,
[7860.58 → 7861.24] why ultra,
[7861.50 → 7862.26] why not just an
[7862.70 → 7863.30] can we just have,
[7863.42 → 7863.82] I don't know,
[7863.84 → 7864.44] like a nine.
[7864.58 → 7867.20] Can we just have some continuity here?
[7867.64 → 7870.80] Why do we go from nine to eight from zero,
[7870.94 → 7872.26] zero to five,
[7873.38 → 7874.24] 14 to two.
[7874.38 → 7874.90] I understand.
[7875.02 → 7875.46] Cause this is,
[7875.58 → 7876.20] this is the
[7876.20 → 7876.98] the generation.
[7877.22 → 7877.26] Yeah,
[7877.30 → 7877.52] sure.
[7877.66 → 7878.58] Processor generation.
[7878.82 → 7878.96] Yeah.
[7878.96 → 7882.26] But why did we move everything down?
[7883.30 → 7885.52] One or maybe two.
[7885.72 → 7891.22] So a 600 class product becomes a four class product.
[7891.38 → 7891.72] Or I,
[7891.90 → 7894.74] I can't even begin to follow along with this.
[7895.00 → 7895.38] Uh,
[7895.50 → 7897.80] AMD had a new naming scheme,
[7898.02 → 7899.42] allegedly new naming scheme,
[7899.80 → 7902.22] allegedly maybe leak on a Seuss's site.
[7902.22 → 7905.62] That looked just as bad as Intel's,
[7905.62 → 7906.18] if not worse.
[7906.18 → 7908.78] Because they shoehorned AI into all the processor names.
[7908.98 → 7910.84] So it was like rise in nine AI.
[7910.84 → 7912.24] And then they switched to a
[7912.30 → 7912.70] uh,
[7912.94 → 7917.34] they switched to a three letter or a three digit numbering scheme as well.
[7917.34 → 7917.94] And it just,
[7918.02 → 7919.26] it was utterly,
[7919.26 → 7921.64] and just under indecipherable.
[7921.64 → 7921.94] I,
[7921.94 → 7921.98] I,
[7921.98 → 7922.16] I,
[7922.16 → 7923.04] I couldn't even,
[7923.36 → 7923.62] uh,
[7923.62 → 7925.64] that has not been confirmed to be real.
[7925.90 → 7926.32] We should do,
[7926.36 → 7927.84] we should do product naming consultation.
[7928.58 → 7929.34] I'd be happy to,
[7929.48 → 7930.20] they wouldn't want,
[7930.38 → 7930.46] they,
[7930.58 → 7930.68] no,
[7930.74 → 7932.16] they wouldn't want our advice though.
[7932.50 → 7932.94] You just,
[7933.02 → 7934.08] you just call it CPU.
[7934.46 → 7934.88] We'd be,
[7935.36 → 7935.78] no,
[7935.90 → 7937.04] I wouldn't.
[7937.04 → 7937.72] We'd be,
[7937.80 → 7939.16] we'd be also stupid.
[7939.16 → 7939.72] Yes.
[7939.88 → 7942.48] We'd be advising them on how to make it.
[7942.82 → 7943.74] This is CPU one.
[7943.84 → 7945.56] We also sell CPU two and three.
[7946.88 → 7947.40] Sorry.
[7948.00 → 7948.98] Don't be CPU.
[7950.50 → 7951.02] Okay.
[7951.06 → 7952.30] Our naming is bad too.
[7952.48 → 7954.08] For very different reasons.
[7954.56 → 7954.74] Okay.
[7954.74 → 7956.40] Maybe don't do naming consultation.
[7956.98 → 7958.82] I think we could do better than them.
[7959.30 → 7960.36] I think anybody could.
[7960.44 → 7960.52] Yeah.
[7960.60 → 7961.28] In fairness to me,
[7961.30 → 7962.72] I wasn't involved in a lot of those names.
[7962.72 → 7963.24] We're always just way too literal.
[7963.80 → 7964.76] We are pretty literal.
[7965.68 → 7966.16] Backpack.
[7968.04 → 7968.90] I mean,
[7968.90 → 7969.74] we're not wrong.
[7969.82 → 7970.42] It's a backpack.
[7971.32 → 7971.72] Screwdriver.
[7971.96 → 7972.84] It is a screwdriver.
[7973.20 → 7975.00] It doesn't even call itself ratcheting screwdriver.
[7975.18 → 7976.10] Just screwdriver.
[7976.40 → 7977.00] It's a screwdriver.
[7977.82 → 7978.22] It's,
[7978.38 → 7980.16] it's,
[7980.52 → 7981.62] you know what you're getting.
[7981.76 → 7982.20] You do.
[7982.42 → 7982.70] Yeah.
[7982.98 → 7983.70] It's better.
[7984.60 → 7985.04] Yeah.
[7985.64 → 7986.08] Sorry.
[7986.34 → 7988.34] I just don't know how much it leans on marketing.
[7988.54 → 7988.82] I mean,
[7988.86 → 7989.10] look,
[7989.12 → 7991.10] we've had some more fun stuff lately.
[7991.28 → 7991.56] Okay.
[7991.56 → 7994.10] There's the phase zip up hoodie.
[7994.40 → 7994.66] Phase.
[7994.76 → 7995.30] I like phase.
[7995.46 → 7995.72] Okay.
[7996.30 → 7996.78] Um,
[7997.00 → 7997.30] okay.
[7997.30 → 7997.62] That's,
[7997.72 → 7998.52] that's pretty literal.
[7998.52 → 7999.16] Um,
[7999.16 → 8000.10] okay.
[8000.56 → 8001.86] We've got a hundred percent cotton.
[8001.86 → 8002.30] Okay.
[8002.44 → 8003.64] The Steve turtleneck.
[8004.10 → 8004.52] Okay.
[8004.54 → 8006.12] This is actually a pretty solid mover.
[8006.28 → 8007.52] That's fairly marketing.
[8007.74 → 8007.86] Yeah.
[8007.94 → 8008.16] Good.
[8008.32 → 8008.80] The Steve.
[8009.02 → 8009.28] Okay.
[8010.08 → 8011.10] Merino t-shirt.
[8011.20 → 8011.34] Okay.
[8011.34 → 8011.60] Stop,
[8011.70 → 8012.70] stop looking at those names.
[8012.92 → 8013.42] Lined.
[8014.48 → 8014.96] Um,
[8015.12 → 8015.56] fan.
[8015.66 → 8015.94] Okay.
[8015.94 → 8016.96] Wag hoodie is pretty good.
[8016.96 → 8017.66] I named that one.
[8017.66 → 8018.20] That one's good.
[8018.40 → 8019.02] That is good.
[8019.08 → 8019.84] I named that one.
[8020.42 → 8021.74] The uncle Linus hoodie.
[8022.06 → 8022.32] Okay.
[8022.32 → 8022.84] But that was,
[8022.92 → 8023.84] that was from a video.
[8023.84 → 8024.98] I don't know if that's fair.
[8025.04 → 8026.98] It was literally actually a joke.
[8027.74 → 8028.18] Um,
[8028.52 → 8029.90] this is not going to be better.
[8030.64 → 8031.08] Hmm.
[8031.46 → 8032.60] I didn't mean to start this.
[8032.68 → 8032.90] I'm sorry.
[8032.90 → 8033.74] Lounge pants are all right.
[8033.94 → 8035.24] I added pro to this.
[8035.64 → 8036.00] I think,
[8036.08 → 8036.18] no,
[8036.22 → 8036.30] no,
[8036.30 → 8037.72] I added premium to this one.
[8038.32 → 8038.74] That,
[8038.82 → 8040.66] that was my contribution to the name of that.
[8040.76 → 8040.98] Okay.
[8041.00 → 8041.60] These are.
[8041.84 → 8044.62] So are the premium sports joggers better than the track joggers?
[8044.72 → 8046.18] Cause the track joggers aren't premium.
[8046.30 → 8047.88] The dropout has a really cool name.
[8047.92 → 8048.92] Doesn't sell at all,
[8049.08 → 8049.82] but people love it.
[8049.82 → 8050.58] I wish people,
[8051.98 → 8056.86] the dropout sweater is like one of the comfiest sweaters I think I've ever had.
[8057.34 → 8059.10] And people don't know that.
[8059.16 → 8059.56] Yeah.
[8059.72 → 8060.86] Because they can't try it.
[8061.20 → 8061.72] I know.
[8062.48 → 8062.94] Retail.
[8062.94 → 8063.96] Retail is a
[8063.98 → 8064.90] is a heck of a thing.
[8064.90 → 8066.62] Like buying clothes at retail.
[8066.72 → 8067.14] I get it.
[8067.26 → 8067.48] Yeah.
[8067.60 → 8069.12] It's tough to buy them online.
[8069.12 → 8069.76] Because you're,
[8069.80 → 8070.94] I feel the same way.
[8071.02 → 8071.98] You're buying it blindly.
[8072.16 → 8072.98] I get it.
[8073.02 → 8073.36] I just,
[8073.44 → 8078.46] I wish people had the opportunity to try it because it's very much like a comfy,
[8078.64 → 8079.72] like nice,
[8080.46 → 8082.72] a little bit more hefty sweater.
[8082.86 → 8083.44] It's nice.
[8083.54 → 8083.92] It's good.
[8085.52 → 8086.46] I enjoy it.
[8087.26 → 8088.68] And I don't like pullovers,
[8088.88 → 8091.02] but I like that sweater.
[8091.02 → 8097.72] AMD has hit a record high in X86 desktop and server market share,
[8097.80 → 8098.28] which is good.
[8098.28 → 8104.28] Cause apparently their GPU gaming business and a custom on cooking business is not going
[8104.28 → 8104.68] so good,
[8104.76 → 8105.78] but this man,
[8105.84 → 8108.56] this looks incredible in servers.
[8108.56 → 8111.72] their revenue share is 33%.
[8111.72 → 8115.10] And that's on a unit share of only 23.6.
[8115.28 → 8121.08] So that means that they are killing Intel at the high end for server,
[8121.60 → 8123.86] like crushing them.
[8126.52 → 8127.04] Crazy.
[8127.04 → 8127.86] Not even close,
[8127.94 → 8128.08] right?
[8128.20 → 8128.34] Yeah.
[8128.74 → 8129.30] Where is,
[8129.38 → 8130.26] where is this topic?
[8130.48 → 8130.92] I'm sorry.
[8131.00 → 8131.36] I'm just,
[8131.48 → 8131.68] uh,
[8131.78 → 8131.92] Oh,
[8131.94 → 8132.66] you're just looking at stuff.
[8132.78 → 8132.90] Yeah.
[8132.90 → 8133.84] I'm looking at this right here.
[8134.62 → 8135.52] Look at it go.
[8136.24 → 8136.48] Woo.
[8137.68 → 8138.12] Wow.
[8138.60 → 8140.08] Number go burr.
[8140.62 → 8140.80] Yeah.
[8140.80 → 8142.78] Things a little less hot on the desktop side.
[8142.88 → 8144.24] I love how them just,
[8144.38 → 8144.66] Oh,
[8144.94 → 8146.72] but this is server market share.
[8146.82 → 8148.44] So it's not just AMD and Intel.
[8148.56 → 8148.72] Yeah.
[8149.66 → 8150.06] Hmm.
[8150.32 → 8150.52] No,
[8150.54 → 8151.22] this is x86.
[8151.50 → 8151.68] Oh,
[8151.76 → 8152.06] I see.
[8152.14 → 8152.32] Okay.
[8152.42 → 8156.40] So I love how them killing it is still being a third of the market.
[8156.72 → 8157.04] Well,
[8157.28 → 8157.80] yeah,
[8157.98 → 8158.76] but I mean,
[8158.82 → 8159.12] you have to,
[8159.12 → 8160.70] compared to some historical record,
[8160.88 → 8162.08] that is crazy.
[8162.32 → 8163.32] And you have to remember too,
[8163.48 → 8169.56] like only part of the decision of which CPU to procure is which one is better.
[8170.22 → 8173.52] A huge part of it is long-term contracts.
[8174.40 → 8175.40] A huge,
[8175.82 → 8178.58] huge part of it is production capacity.
[8179.30 → 8179.88] Like as an
[8179.96 → 8181.12] as an end user.
[8181.38 → 8181.68] Okay.
[8181.70 → 8184.22] You would look at the marketing for someone like a
[8184.22 → 8186.82] a mouse pad factory in China,
[8186.94 → 8188.78] which they have marketing.
[8189.10 → 8190.54] You'd look at the marketing and go,
[8190.68 → 8191.16] well,
[8191.18 → 8197.42] that's stupid because it'll be full of things like what their production capacity is on a monthly basis.
[8197.42 → 8198.24] And you're sitting there going,
[8199.04 → 8199.16] well,
[8199.54 → 8199.80] yeah,
[8199.86 → 8201.02] but are they good?
[8201.42 → 8201.68] Do you,
[8201.68 → 8203.26] do you make anything good?
[8204.36 → 8205.52] Depending on the buyer,
[8205.62 → 8208.70] that may not be their top priority because they just need,
[8208.72 → 8210.08] mouse pads.
[8210.88 → 8211.50] And if,
[8211.76 → 8211.96] and the
[8211.96 → 8216.68] and the factory that they're working with may simply not have enough capacity of mouse pads.
[8216.68 → 8218.46] And so at a certain point,
[8218.52 → 8223.12] like AMD can only buy so much of TSMC's finite capacity.
[8223.34 → 8224.86] And at a certain point,
[8225.16 → 8227.18] supply and demand.
[8227.18 → 8229.60] If everyone tries to buy it,
[8229.82 → 8231.72] it will drive up the price to the point where,
[8231.86 → 8232.04] oh,
[8232.16 → 8232.36] well,
[8232.50 → 8232.66] hey,
[8232.74 → 8234.44] Intel's products not looking that bad anymore.
[8234.98 → 8235.26] Intel,
[8235.36 → 8235.68] meanwhile,
[8235.90 → 8237.76] has their own production capacity.
[8237.76 → 8243.24] So they effectively get to sell every chip that AMD can't make.
[8243.24 → 8248.40] And it will be that way for the foreseeable future.
[8249.12 → 8254.14] That is until AMD can get more production capacity from Intel's foundry business.
[8254.76 → 8255.94] That'll be an interesting day.
[8255.96 → 8256.62] We'll see how that goes.
[8256.80 → 8258.28] Ever since I talked about how I,
[8258.28 → 8259.86] I like Intel's long-term plan,
[8259.94 → 8261.68] their stock has dropped considerably.
[8262.18 → 8264.00] I still like their long-term plan,
[8264.08 → 8265.76] but I made it very clear at that time.
[8265.96 → 8267.52] None of this is investment advice.
[8267.52 → 8271.46] I made it very clear at that time that it was a long-term play that I liked.
[8271.96 → 8273.00] Long-term play.
[8274.02 → 8274.94] Fox in a box says,
[8275.04 → 8275.34] oh yeah.
[8275.48 → 8277.14] So forget contracts and availability.
[8277.74 → 8279.52] What about just comfort?
[8280.28 → 8283.08] People buy based on brands all the time.
[8283.32 → 8287.76] That was an LMG clip that went up actually shortly before the WAN show today from last week,
[8287.84 → 8289.66] where I talked about not being fans,
[8289.96 → 8290.42] but man,
[8290.90 → 8291.30] people,
[8291.54 → 8293.96] people buy what they're comfortable with.
[8294.02 → 8295.46] And you're fans at different levels.
[8295.46 → 8297.82] And Fox in a box says at my company,
[8297.96 → 8301.38] we buy more Intel servers because we have Intel servers, and we don't have issues.
[8301.38 → 8302.66] So we will buy more of them.
[8303.16 → 8304.30] Which honestly,
[8304.92 → 8309.54] in a lot of situations is a mostly good enough reason.
[8309.66 → 8312.50] When it comes to technology and how fast moving it is,
[8312.58 → 8314.12] maybe less so.
[8314.36 → 8318.64] But when you're dealing with like trying to convince people that are doing purchasing decisions for a huge range of things,
[8318.64 → 8318.96] and that,
[8319.06 → 8320.92] that just happens to be one part of it.
[8322.04 → 8322.44] Yeah.
[8325.00 → 8325.44] Anyway,
[8325.46 → 8326.80] should we talk about,
[8326.80 → 8327.52] uh,
[8327.62 → 8328.52] hell divers and Sony?
[8329.00 → 8329.34] Yeah,
[8329.38 → 8329.70] sure.
[8330.38 → 8330.98] This is wild.
[8331.22 → 8332.68] So this is not a
[8332.68 → 8334.08] a fleshed out topic that we have.
[8334.10 → 8335.80] So this is going to be a little bit erratic,
[8335.80 → 8336.22] but,
[8336.22 → 8336.84] uh,
[8336.84 → 8338.50] because I think it happened like today.
[8339.20 → 8339.76] This is,
[8339.86 → 8341.20] this is pretty hot news.
[8341.30 → 8341.44] Yeah.
[8341.44 → 8341.70] I don't,
[8341.76 → 8342.52] I don't know exactly.
[8342.56 → 8343.24] It's pretty fresh though,
[8343.28 → 8344.06] but it's,
[8344.12 → 8344.78] it's quite fresh.
[8344.84 → 8345.90] I know it was Friday somewhere,
[8346.06 → 8347.36] but it might've been somewhere else in the world.
[8347.36 → 8348.34] Um,
[8349.30 → 8349.84] but Sony,
[8349.94 → 8350.14] so,
[8350.24 → 8350.70] uh,
[8350.70 → 8352.44] let's rewind to last week.
[8352.44 → 8356.44] Sony forced PlayStation network login onto hell divers too.
[8357.12 → 8357.68] Now,
[8357.92 → 8358.42] PC gamers,
[8358.42 → 8359.14] didn't like that.
[8359.20 → 8364.80] PC gamers are pretty kind of used to needing other launchers or needing other logins.
[8364.80 → 8368.40] Even the beloved Balder's gate three uses its own launcher.
[8368.58 → 8370.18] They have a really cool reason.
[8370.34 → 8373.34] Even CD project red has their own like account.
[8373.82 → 8374.34] It's optional.
[8374.52 → 8376.64] You can just continue to play rock star,
[8376.76 → 8377.26] Ubisoft.
[8377.36 → 8377.62] Yeah.
[8377.62 → 8380.34] Everyone in their dog has tons of their own nonsense.
[8380.52 → 8383.58] Beloved developer battle state games has their own launcher.
[8385.16 → 8386.72] And they're not even on steam.
[8387.20 → 8389.88] I probably could have gotten them on a spit take if only he was drinking something.
[8390.14 → 8390.36] Yeah.
[8390.82 → 8391.12] Yeah.
[8391.48 → 8391.66] The
[8391.66 → 8392.52] the Marian one,
[8392.64 → 8394.78] most people embraced it a little bit more heavily because it's,
[8394.78 → 8397.28] because it syncs your saves between platforms,
[8397.28 → 8399.24] which is like actually kind of six.
[8399.34 → 8400.48] If you had a save on a console,
[8400.52 → 8401.78] you could sync it to a PC anyway.
[8402.50 → 8402.94] Um,
[8403.32 → 8411.04] so some people were somewhat surprised at the degree or the amount of backlash that they received for forcing this login.
[8411.60 → 8416.72] One major component was because they forced the login after people had already purchased the game.
[8416.82 → 8419.34] This is also not the first time that has happened.
[8419.34 → 8419.70] Yeah.
[8419.84 → 8424.64] But the huge kicker was that by forcing PSN,
[8424.78 → 8431.64] they were suddenly not allowing people in certain regions of the world to pay this,
[8431.88 → 8432.06] uh,
[8432.06 → 8436.26] to play this game that they had bought and been playing for a significant period of time.
[8436.26 → 8439.48] And that's because the PlayStation network was simply not available in that region.
[8439.48 → 8441.24] So they were allowed to buy the game,
[8441.24 → 8447.52] but they weren't allowed to create an account that is a prerequisite to play the game.
[8447.74 → 8448.84] And what's worse,
[8450.28 → 8454.26] fraudulently declaring that you live in a different country other than where you live.
[8454.44 → 8455.84] By use of a VPN or something.
[8455.98 → 8458.24] Can get your PSN network banned.
[8458.24 → 8461.82] And then we're back to square one, and you can't play the game.
[8462.04 → 8462.28] Yeah.
[8462.62 → 8465.02] So gamers raised hell.
[8465.34 → 8466.26] It was great.
[8466.48 → 8467.76] This doesn't happen that often.
[8468.60 → 8469.04] Um,
[8469.22 → 8469.58] in it.
[8469.58 → 8469.72] Well,
[8469.78 → 8469.98] okay.
[8469.98 → 8471.56] It happens literally all the time.
[8471.56 → 8471.70] Yeah.
[8471.70 → 8474.20] But it's not often that they actually get something done.
[8474.30 → 8474.48] Yeah.
[8474.48 → 8475.44] I think part of it,
[8475.50 → 8477.44] and I've been meaning to talk to you about this,
[8477.44 → 8478.50] but this is my theory.
[8479.42 → 8484.80] I think the biggest part of it was that the boycott was forced.
[8486.16 → 8486.64] Yeah.
[8486.76 → 8488.38] By the controversy itself.
[8488.46 → 8488.66] Yeah.
[8488.78 → 8489.38] And I think,
[8489.38 → 8493.12] and I've talked about this a fair bit with the recent battle state games controversy.
[8494.46 → 8499.04] We've talked about this a fair bit recently where gamers are spineless, and they will raise
[8499.04 → 8505.16] hell about something and then immediately cave and start playing the game and buying microtransactions
[8505.16 → 8505.56] again.
[8505.68 → 8505.88] Oh,
[8505.92 → 8506.72] I have news about that.
[8506.72 → 8509.42] And these companies never learn anything.
[8509.42 → 8510.88] But in this case,
[8511.28 → 8521.70] because the source of the controversy inherently forced angry gamers to stop playing the game,
[8522.18 → 8528.18] it affected player numbers in a way that is very large and very measurable because this
[8528.18 → 8533.38] is like the hottest game in the world right now to the point where they went,
[8533.60 → 8534.36] Oh no,
[8534.44 → 8535.58] we can't do this.
[8535.58 → 8538.02] people are not playing the game.
[8538.74 → 8541.40] And what we learned is probably nothing.
[8541.40 → 8546.62] But what we should have learned is that that's how effective a boycott can be.
[8546.62 → 8547.16] An actual one,
[8547.16 → 8549.96] an actual one where gamers actually stop playing the game.
[8549.96 → 8550.96] And rage hard.
[8550.96 → 8551.14] And rage hard.
[8551.14 → 8552.40] So there's more to it.
[8552.40 → 8557.70] Some regions also require you to have a PS4 or PS5 to even have a PlayStation network account.
[8557.70 → 8559.20] So some regions couldn't do it.
[8559.34 → 8561.34] Some regions had to have specific hardware,
[8561.72 → 8562.10] et cetera.
[8562.26 → 8563.26] It was a nightmare.
[8563.92 → 8565.50] There was a huge rage.
[8565.50 → 8566.50] The arrowhead,
[8566.50 → 8568.66] the actual developer behind the game,
[8568.66 → 8572.22] like more or less agreed with the community and was like,
[8572.28 → 8576.36] this is dumb and was kind of fighting against it as well.
[8576.48 → 8578.86] So it was a very unified force.
[8578.86 → 8579.86] Massive,
[8579.86 → 8580.36] massive,
[8580.36 → 8580.86] massive,
[8580.86 → 8582.06] massive review.
[8582.06 → 8582.98] What do you call it?
[8582.98 → 8583.88] Review bombing on,
[8583.88 → 8586.98] on steam tanking the rating of the game very significantly.
[8586.98 → 8591.90] This was a beloved game a month ago and is now being heavily hated on.
[8592.30 → 8595.04] So this was done like on last Friday,
[8595.04 → 8597.26] I think right before the weekend,
[8597.26 → 8600.74] I think it's Monday or Tuesday comes around and Sony pulls it.
[8600.94 → 8601.22] Okay.
[8601.26 → 8603.16] You don't need a PSN account anymore.
[8604.54 → 8605.64] Come today.
[8605.64 → 8609.10] And I got confirmation by people in chat that this was today.
[8609.62 → 8615.20] You still don't need a PlayStation network account because I guess they learned that much,
[8615.20 → 8618.18] but I think they didn't really get the point,
[8618.44 → 8619.40] the real point,
[8619.56 → 8625.98] the point that people were really mad about because all those zones where you can't get PSN
[8625.98 → 8629.00] now can't buy the game.
[8629.08 → 8631.00] A lot of people thought those zones couldn't play.
[8631.38 → 8632.20] That's not true.
[8632.24 → 8633.14] If you already own it,
[8633.16 → 8634.68] you can play as far as my understanding goes,
[8634.76 → 8635.70] please feel free to correct me,
[8635.74 → 8638.30] but I'm pretty sure you can play in those zones.
[8638.44 → 8640.60] But now I think it's 180.
[8642.62 → 8643.74] How is it defined?
[8643.84 → 8644.96] Let me find it here really quick.
[8648.50 → 8649.70] Three more countries banned.
[8649.90 → 8653.06] It's like 180 areas.
[8653.28 → 8654.58] You can't play the game in anymore.
[8654.58 → 8656.46] Or you can't buy.
[8656.64 → 8657.48] Buy the game anymore.
[8657.48 → 8658.76] They apparently still can't play.
[8659.04 → 8661.34] So this seems to be very much a developing situation.
[8661.64 → 8662.42] Yeah, it happened today.
[8662.56 → 8663.90] Things are changing actively.
[8665.16 → 8666.36] 180 regions,
[8666.54 → 8667.16] they're calling it.
[8667.68 → 8670.10] So it started at 177,
[8670.10 → 8671.68] and then they added Estonia,
[8671.90 → 8672.30] Lithuania,
[8672.46 → 8673.70] and Latvia to that list,
[8673.74 → 8675.14] which brought it to 180.
[8675.44 → 8681.58] You can see this changing live because the Steam DB has a history where you can see changes.
[8681.58 → 8685.26] So people are tracking the changes live,
[8685.36 → 8686.58] which is wild.
[8687.54 → 8691.52] Yeah, it's 180 of the territories that Steam recognizes.
[8691.52 → 8693.00] What is the logic here?
[8693.14 → 8694.22] So that was my question.
[8694.38 → 8698.72] Why would you block people from buying the game in 180 regions?
[8699.14 → 8699.82] What is the point?
[8699.82 → 8701.60] What is Sony's,
[8702.48 → 8702.74] you know,
[8702.82 → 8703.10] potential?
[8703.16 → 8708.84] Because the only thing I can think of is there's some potential legal liability for operating.
[8708.84 → 8711.78] You know when you buy a piece of software and the EULA is like,
[8711.86 → 8711.94] yeah,
[8711.96 → 8714.86] you have to agree not to use this for acts of terrorism.
[8714.86 → 8715.18] Yeah.
[8715.42 → 8715.64] Like,
[8716.14 → 8716.36] like,
[8716.40 → 8716.68] like,
[8716.68 → 8717.08] like,
[8717.08 → 8718.32] is there some kind of,
[8718.32 → 8726.28] is there some kind of weird potential legal liability from the game being sold in,
[8726.36 → 8727.02] in these regions?
[8727.02 → 8727.44] But then,
[8727.50 → 8727.66] you know,
[8727.68 → 8728.66] if that's the case,
[8728.66 → 8731.26] then why is it a problem to,
[8731.34 → 8731.44] you know,
[8731.44 → 8733.86] to buy Dave the Diver in Congo?
[8734.12 → 8734.40] You know,
[8734.40 → 8734.64] like,
[8734.64 → 8734.82] I,
[8735.16 → 8735.42] like,
[8735.48 → 8735.64] what,
[8735.64 → 8736.78] what,
[8736.78 → 8738.38] what exactly is the logic here?
[8738.42 → 8739.48] And does it have to do with that?
[8739.54 → 8740.98] Sony is running their own Congo.
[8741.10 → 8742.50] That's one of the places where they can't buy it.
[8742.50 → 8742.94] Is,
[8743.06 → 8743.24] is,
[8743.38 → 8747.48] is it something to do with the fact that Sony is running PSN?
[8747.48 → 8747.92] And,
[8748.02 → 8748.52] and so,
[8748.68 → 8748.96] you know,
[8749.00 → 8753.02] if they don't have all the legalities sorted out for operating in that region,
[8753.02 → 8753.40] then,
[8753.60 → 8754.44] then they can't.
[8754.48 → 8755.70] But then if that's the case,
[8756.64 → 8759.04] why not just waive the requirement?
[8759.14 → 8759.26] I mean,
[8759.28 → 8759.50] don't,
[8759.58 → 8759.72] don't,
[8759.84 → 8760.94] don't you want our money?
[8761.94 → 8762.56] You know,
[8762.76 → 8763.22] like from,
[8763.38 → 8765.10] on behalf of gamers everywhere,
[8765.10 → 8767.88] do you not want our money?
[8768.72 → 8769.14] Yeah.
[8769.16 → 8770.80] Some people are saying in full play chat,
[8770.86 → 8772.36] this kind of makes sense that they're doing,
[8772.36 → 8773.18] this now,
[8773.32 → 8774.96] hoping that the backlash will be less.
[8775.18 → 8778.20] And then they want to add PSN requirement in the future.
[8778.48 → 8782.54] And then when only people that could have PSN on it are really playing the game,
[8782.60 → 8783.92] they're hoping that the impact will be lowed.
[8784.12 → 8785.30] I don't know if that's the play or not,
[8785.38 → 8789.64] but they are adding this type of restriction to another game as well.
[8789.82 → 8789.96] Yeah.
[8790.02 → 8792.16] So this is not a small play for them.
[8792.16 → 8794.08] This is something that they clearly intend to do.
[8794.08 → 8799.60] Those regions have never gotten access to the game back.
[8799.70 → 8800.92] They added three more places today.
[8801.04 → 8801.38] Yeah.
[8801.38 → 8801.84] I don't know.
[8801.92 → 8802.84] I haven't exactly,
[8802.84 → 8803.30] you know,
[8803.36 → 8806.18] tried to play with an account from Yemen,
[8806.36 → 8806.86] for example,
[8806.90 → 8807.64] or Zimbabwe,
[8807.78 → 8808.44] uh,
[8808.44 → 8810.08] or any of these other places,
[8810.18 → 8810.64] Aruba,
[8810.96 → 8811.44] Angola,
[8812.06 → 8812.68] uh,
[8812.76 → 8813.10] there's,
[8813.10 → 8814.26] there's 180 of them.
[8814.46 → 8816.52] You can easily see it on the steam DB website.
[8816.52 → 8820.36] Cause there's the change of adding 180 countries or 173,
[8820.52 → 8821.20] 177,
[8821.26 → 8822.12] and then three more.
[8822.66 → 8823.14] Um,
[8823.94 → 8824.22] but yeah,
[8824.22 → 8824.42] that's,
[8824.48 → 8824.82] it's,
[8824.94 → 8826.44] it's weird to me.
[8826.64 → 8830.36] If you were a game development studio.
[8831.14 → 8831.54] Sure.
[8831.98 → 8832.60] And Sony,
[8832.68 → 8833.66] not a thing I know a ton about.
[8833.92 → 8834.82] Sony approached you.
[8834.86 → 8835.34] I'll allow it.
[8835.90 → 8839.72] Consider that a lot of game development studios do look for publishers,
[8839.72 → 8842.16] not because in modern day you really need,
[8842.16 → 8842.98] uh,
[8842.98 → 8844.58] the publishing side of the publishers,
[8844.58 → 8846.62] but because you need the funding.
[8847.50 → 8848.70] So you're a game development studio.
[8848.80 → 8849.66] You're looking for funding.
[8849.72 → 8851.28] You need more funding to finish your game off.
[8851.28 → 8852.18] You think it's going to be a hit,
[8852.26 → 8852.94] but it's not out yet.
[8853.60 → 8854.00] Um,
[8854.22 → 8857.26] and Sony approaches you after this happened,
[8857.46 → 8860.08] you take that deal or do you keep looking?
[8860.84 → 8861.72] Because I'm looking,
[8861.82 → 8867.18] I'm looking at how Arrowhead is kind of being tossed around in the middle of
[8867.18 → 8867.28] this.
[8867.28 → 8867.40] Dude,
[8867.44 → 8868.10] I take the money.
[8868.78 → 8869.24] I mean,
[8869.50 → 8870.22] the games,
[8870.78 → 8873.16] game development industry is brutal.
[8873.32 → 8873.56] It's brutal.
[8874.08 → 8874.36] Um,
[8874.38 → 8874.60] if,
[8874.70 → 8875.22] if that's,
[8875.28 → 8875.50] I mean,
[8875.52 → 8877.20] obviously if I have another offer,
[8877.26 → 8878.10] I'll consider it.
[8878.26 → 8878.40] Yeah.
[8878.40 → 8878.78] So if it's,
[8878.78 → 8879.18] if like,
[8879.18 → 8880.84] if Sony's the only one on the table,
[8880.90 → 8881.18] it's like,
[8881.22 → 8882.68] who's my better option at Microsoft?
[8882.68 → 8883.88] Yeah.
[8883.88 → 8884.76] You might just get closed.
[8886.06 → 8886.98] And to be clear,
[8887.10 → 8887.42] you know,
[8887.42 → 8889.14] we're not necessarily talking about an acquisition,
[8889.14 → 8890.04] but like,
[8890.36 → 8890.56] you know,
[8890.60 → 8890.70] what,
[8890.74 → 8892.14] what are Microsoft terms going to be?
[8892.34 → 8892.98] Do I have to,
[8893.06 → 8896.12] do I have to allow it to be exclusive on game pass before I can even sell it for
[8896.12 → 8896.58] myself?
[8896.58 → 8896.92] Or like,
[8897.08 → 8897.38] like what,
[8897.54 → 8898.20] right?
[8898.20 → 8898.40] Like,
[8898.40 → 8899.04] I don't know.
[8899.32 → 8900.20] It depends on,
[8900.28 → 8902.68] on everyone is going to have strings attached.
[8902.82 → 8903.64] Just a part of the very,
[8903.68 → 8904.36] there's no free money.
[8904.60 → 8904.80] Yeah.
[8905.12 → 8907.12] So with all of that in mind,
[8907.12 → 8908.12] it might still,
[8908.30 → 8909.28] it might still be the
[8909.32 → 8910.62] the best option,
[8910.62 → 8913.28] which sucks.
[8914.06 → 8914.66] But like,
[8914.72 → 8915.16] realistically,
[8915.16 → 8915.70] I don't,
[8915.72 → 8916.56] I don't have a backup plan.
[8916.68 → 8916.86] I,
[8916.86 → 8917.04] I,
[8917.12 → 8917.34] I,
[8917.34 → 8921.54] I don't have $25 million to give you to finish your game.
[8921.70 → 8922.12] I mean,
[8922.12 → 8922.72] if Linus,
[8922.84 → 8927.02] if Linus publisher game funding group existed,
[8927.02 → 8927.38] I'd,
[8927.42 → 8927.52] yeah,
[8927.56 → 8927.96] I'd be happy.
[8928.06 → 8931.34] There's a bunch of other YouTubers starting up game publishers.
[8931.66 → 8932.82] I wish them luck with that.
[8933.02 → 8933.32] I mean,
[8933.40 → 8933.56] Hey,
[8933.62 → 8936.26] I heard there's a lot of talent looking for work right now,
[8936.32 → 8936.88] looking to,
[8937.06 → 8938.74] looking to build cool gaming experiences.
[8938.74 → 8944.02] So that's the one possible silver lining is I think we're going to see like a
[8944.02 → 8947.50] like a boom of small studios.
[8947.78 → 8950.82] Let's embrace this silver lining for a quick second to get off this topic.
[8950.82 → 8951.94] Cause it kind of sucks anyway.
[8952.40 → 8952.88] Um,
[8952.88 → 8954.88] but big mode from,
[8954.88 → 8955.40] uh,
[8955.52 → 8955.80] Oh,
[8955.96 → 8957.00] is it donkey or,
[8957.02 → 8957.40] what?
[8957.58 → 8957.74] Yeah.
[8957.88 → 8958.28] Uh,
[8958.38 → 8958.86] big mode.
[8958.98 → 8959.62] Is this,
[8959.70 → 8960.88] is this game out now?
[8961.28 → 8961.56] Animal?
[8961.64 → 8961.76] Well,
[8961.80 → 8962.24] is it out?
[8962.32 → 8962.84] It came out today.
[8963.04 → 8963.28] Animal?
[8963.40 → 8963.50] Well,
[8963.56 → 8966.72] people seem to love this solo dev.
[8966.88 → 8969.54] I obviously haven't had time to play it cause it came out today,
[8969.54 → 8973.10] but people are raving about first game they've published.
[8973.10 → 8973.36] Right?
[8973.66 → 8973.92] Yeah.
[8974.40 → 8974.72] Sick.
[8975.50 → 8977.64] Overwhelmingly positive steam reviews right now.
[8977.88 → 8978.68] Good sign.
[8979.40 → 8981.28] 97% of all reviews.
[8981.28 → 8983.02] And there's been 1834 reviews.
[8983.10 → 8984.12] That's a lot of today.
[8984.34 → 8985.16] That's a lot of players.
[8985.16 → 8987.38] 97% are marking as positive.
[8987.72 → 8990.06] Was it 3% of people who own a game review it?
[8991.06 → 8991.38] Yeah.
[8991.82 → 8993.10] 1800 is huge.
[8993.18 → 8995.00] So this thing is smashing already.
[8995.16 → 8995.60] Good job guys.
[8995.60 → 8996.58] And people love it.
[8996.58 → 8997.70] So Billy Basso,
[8998.10 → 8998.82] great work,
[8999.22 → 8999.82] big mode,
[9000.10 → 9001.32] good first release.
[9001.54 → 9002.62] Maybe I'll go home and play it.
[9002.70 → 9003.10] Dang.
[9003.86 → 9004.32] Good job.
[9005.08 → 9007.16] So speaking of other alternative publishers,
[9007.84 → 9008.08] my,
[9008.16 → 9013.08] my way too short video on a float plane was talking about how this type of
[9013.08 → 9013.62] stuff is,
[9013.68 → 9015.32] is happening more and more lately.
[9015.32 → 9018.92] And apparently at least big mode is doing it.
[9018.92 → 9019.12] Well,
[9019.18 → 9021.00] I'm not going to say all the rest of them are going to do it.
[9021.00 → 9021.14] Well,
[9021.26 → 9022.34] I'm not going to say there's,
[9022.54 → 9022.80] you know,
[9022.80 → 9024.48] a ton of Billy Basso's out there,
[9024.48 → 9026.10] but I'm really stoked that,
[9026.38 → 9027.36] that this is working out.
[9027.68 → 9028.48] This is great.
[9031.66 → 9032.34] Very cool.
[9032.34 → 9034.68] Obviously I can't tell everything about the game.
[9035.52 → 9036.24] Looks cool.
[9036.44 → 9038.88] Kind of reminds me of like Undertake a little bit,
[9039.06 → 9040.74] maybe a little bit of like Hollow Knight.
[9042.28 → 9044.92] I don't know.
[9044.96 → 9045.40] It just seems,
[9045.58 → 9046.88] seems like a vibe.
[9047.46 → 9047.72] Yeah.
[9048.48 → 9049.84] Fascinating art style.
[9050.00 → 9051.46] Look at the reflections in the water.
[9051.82 → 9052.12] Yeah.
[9052.46 → 9052.64] Sick.
[9052.74 → 9053.28] Super cool.
[9054.38 → 9055.24] Very excited.
[9055.34 → 9056.30] Do you know what it's made with Dan?
[9056.48 → 9057.44] He wrote his own engine.
[9059.30 → 9059.90] All right,
[9059.90 → 9061.28] Billy Basso gang,
[9061.40 → 9061.58] dude.
[9061.58 → 9062.60] Absolute goat,
[9062.60 → 9063.82] goat solo dev.
[9063.98 → 9064.78] My goodness.
[9065.84 → 9066.24] Linus,
[9066.30 → 9066.96] you're still muted,
[9067.06 → 9067.60] by the way.
[9067.68 → 9069.50] That's not even fair to the other devs.
[9069.60 → 9069.76] Anyway,
[9069.88 → 9070.06] sorry.
[9070.14 → 9072.62] What I had said before was it feels like somewhere in between,
[9072.80 → 9072.94] like,
[9073.10 → 9075.94] or it reminds me a little bit of like Undertake or Hollow Knight.
[9076.42 → 9077.24] Kind of,
[9077.42 → 9078.50] I think it's a puzzle,
[9078.50 → 9081.00] puzzle style platformer rather than like a
[9082.06 → 9082.98] anything else,
[9083.02 → 9083.30] I think.
[9083.48 → 9083.90] Hold on.
[9084.08 → 9085.40] How big is the game?
[9086.56 → 9087.54] Is this real?
[9087.98 → 9089.70] Is it actually 40 legs?
[9089.90 → 9091.56] I'm questioning this.
[9092.36 → 9093.18] 34 legs.
[9094.84 → 9096.04] 34 megabyte game.
[9096.16 → 9096.92] 33 legs.
[9096.94 → 9097.58] It's getting smaller.
[9098.10 → 9098.70] They're the mega.
[9098.70 → 9099.12] 42,
[9099.22 → 9099.36] 34.
[9099.36 → 9100.48] They're the megabits.
[9101.12 → 9102.22] More like omega-bytes.
[9102.22 → 9103.48] Under the system requirements,
[9103.48 → 9106.58] it says that you need 40 legs of available space.
[9106.60 → 9107.52] More like sigma bytes.
[9107.52 → 9107.84] Hold on.
[9108.08 → 9108.68] Look at this.
[9108.96 → 9109.40] Look at this.
[9109.70 → 9112.24] You need a 64-bit processor,
[9112.72 → 9114.32] one gigahertz of speed,
[9114.58 → 9115.82] one gig of RAM,
[9116.24 → 9117.94] and 40 legs of space.
[9117.94 → 9119.22] Oh my god.
[9119.22 → 9120.34] I can run it on my watch.
[9120.62 → 9122.32] Is this Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[9122.46 → 9123.08] What's happening?
[9123.24 → 9125.84] I would love to know what he wrote this in.
[9126.16 → 9127.10] What the heck?
[9127.16 → 9128.92] That is incredibly optimized.
[9129.44 → 9129.82] Hey.
[9130.38 → 9131.86] That makes me happy.
[9132.10 → 9133.84] Apparently on someone's computer right now,
[9133.88 → 9135.46] it's 33.37 legs.
[9135.46 → 9138.08] I am so excited to see this pop off.
[9138.18 → 9139.30] I might get it just for that.
[9139.64 → 9139.82] Yeah.
[9139.96 → 9140.80] I mean, yeah.
[9140.84 → 9141.50] I want to play this.
[9141.72 → 9142.78] You know what I'm excited for?
[9142.94 → 9143.64] What are you excited for?
[9143.70 → 9146.60] We have some leftovers from the charity stream
[9146.60 → 9149.60] that didn't end up clearing payment.
[9151.08 → 9152.82] So the proceeds from these items
[9152.82 → 9155.24] will still go to BC Children's Hospital,
[9155.52 → 9158.12] and the items are live on our Whatnot account.
[9158.42 → 9160.66] They are available for purchase for anyone to grab,
[9161.12 → 9163.90] and mobile app users will be able to easily find the listing
[9163.90 → 9165.30] by navigating to our profile.
[9165.46 → 9166.32] Linus Tech Tips.
[9166.42 → 9167.38] No spaces, no caps.
[9167.92 → 9169.28] For desktop slash web users,
[9169.42 → 9171.76] the products only appear if you search for the username
[9171.76 → 9173.74] Linus Tech Tips at the top of the site
[9173.74 → 9176.40] and view the products that will appear from your search.
[9177.26 → 9178.96] We've got an Plato streaming bundle,
[9179.42 → 9181.30] a Corsair 6500X.
[9182.16 → 9184.44] Oh, I guess that's a gaming computer
[9184.44 → 9186.10] because that price is pretty high.
[9186.36 → 9186.74] Oh, yeah.
[9186.78 → 9187.96] That must be one of the machines we built.
[9188.46 → 9189.50] We have the LTT,
[9189.92 → 9192.22] probably TSA approved regular screwdriver.
[9192.62 → 9193.18] What is that?
[9193.30 → 9194.34] A Noctua cooling bundle.
[9194.34 → 9195.52] It's a weird,
[9195.88 → 9198.62] I think it was a full-sized handle with a stubby,
[9198.62 → 9200.36] oh, yeah, shaft.
[9200.68 → 9202.50] We have a Noctua hoodie in large,
[9202.96 → 9204.72] his and her short circuit hoodie bundle,
[9205.26 → 9207.44] an Acer Predator Helios Neo 16,
[9208.14 → 9209.80] the Alienware bundle number three,
[9209.94 → 9212.28] and a couple of LTT water bottles.
[9212.48 → 9214.26] All of these are proceeds for charity,
[9214.26 → 9216.82] so you can go check them out at whatnot,
[9217.30 → 9219.10] username Linus Tech Tips,
[9219.26 → 9219.96] no spaces,
[9220.60 → 9221.34] no caps.
[9223.24 → 9225.90] Oh, we have a Brink folding competition update.
[9226.04 → 9228.38] We're currently placed fifth in the Brink pentathlon,
[9228.60 → 9230.60] and we need more power for the final push,
[9230.78 → 9232.54] so visit the Folding at Home page
[9232.54 → 9234.86] on LinusTechTips.com to join the squad.
[9235.52 → 9237.34] Anything else you want to go through in here, Luke?
[9238.04 → 9239.86] EA, we don't have to talk about this too much.
[9239.90 → 9241.04] I don't have a lot of details on it,
[9241.08 → 9243.10] but EA announced that they might be putting ads
[9243.10 → 9244.46] in AAA games.
[9244.96 → 9246.42] This isn't entirely new.
[9246.64 → 9248.44] We've seen ads in games before.
[9248.60 → 9249.92] I don't necessarily know what they mean by this.
[9250.18 → 9252.40] I don't know if they mean intrusive ads,
[9252.42 → 9254.38] like it's going to play like a video ad
[9254.38 → 9255.30] in front of your face,
[9255.30 → 9257.12] because there's been product placement
[9257.12 → 9259.50] in games forever,
[9259.50 → 9261.58] like billboards and all this other type of stuff.
[9261.58 → 9263.64] People just having items.
[9264.08 → 9265.02] It's been a thing forever.
[9265.18 → 9267.34] So I'm assuming it's new and worse in some way,
[9267.42 → 9268.52] but I don't have a ton to say about it.
[9269.30 → 9269.78] Also,
[9271.72 → 9273.40] upgradable laptops are back.
[9274.26 → 9277.12] LP Cam 2 has been in the news lately.
[9277.60 → 9279.58] Lenovo has released a ThinkPad workstation
[9279.58 → 9282.68] that is the first laptop compatible with LP Cam 2.
[9283.36 → 9283.98] You're muted.
[9285.26 → 9287.28] LP Cam 2 is here.
[9287.42 → 9288.84] Upgradable laptops are back.
[9288.96 → 9291.22] Lenovo has released a ThinkPad workstation
[9291.22 → 9292.92] that is the first laptop
[9292.92 → 9294.82] that's compatible with LP Cam 2,
[9294.92 → 9295.98] a new DRAM standard
[9295.98 → 9297.64] that was recently published by DEC.
[9298.42 → 9300.14] A big selling point for these new modules
[9300.14 → 9301.68] is that they will be faster,
[9302.12 → 9302.68] more efficient,
[9302.90 → 9305.22] and more compact than SODIUM,
[9305.84 → 9308.56] and also easier to upgrade or replace
[9308.56 → 9309.50] than soldered RAM.
[9309.58 → 9311.16] So they're kind of the best of both worlds.
[9311.70 → 9313.22] Replacement LP Cam 2 modules
[9313.22 → 9315.08] are available directly from Micron.
[9315.28 → 9317.12] I have had a ton of people,
[9317.12 → 9318.08] like seriously,
[9318.08 → 9321.64] this is probably out of every random,
[9322.02 → 9324.18] esoteric tech thing
[9324.18 → 9326.00] that people have asked me to make a video about.
[9326.18 → 9327.80] This has been the most common.
[9327.90 → 9329.02] I have someone message me about it
[9329.02 → 9330.64] probably once a month or so
[9330.64 → 9331.88] over the last while.
[9332.04 → 9333.60] I don't get a ton of video requests
[9333.60 → 9335.96] like directly in my DMs
[9335.96 → 9337.32] or my inbox or my mentions,
[9337.32 → 9339.62] but this is one that has come up enough times
[9339.62 → 9340.16] that I'm like,
[9340.82 → 9342.18] wow, people sure ask me
[9342.18 → 9343.44] to make a video about this a lot.
[9343.44 → 9345.68] Well, conveniently for you,
[9346.74 → 9348.74] we did.
[9349.68 → 9352.26] And here's the ad that plays before it.
[9354.36 → 9355.40] There we go.
[9355.40 → 9355.96] Oh, yeah.
[9356.58 → 9357.88] It's LP Cam.
[9358.66 → 9360.42] We did a whole video
[9360.42 → 9362.88] and it was pretty cool
[9362.88 → 9366.24] and we covered it in pretty darn good detail.
[9366.40 → 9368.78] We even had a module back a year ago.
[9369.32 → 9370.12] You're welcome.
[9370.76 → 9371.90] More like a year and a half ago.
[9371.90 → 9373.70] So, we also...
[9373.70 → 9374.16] Nice.
[9374.30 → 9374.92] Hey, you know,
[9375.06 → 9376.60] before you send me a DM
[9376.60 → 9377.84] asking me to make a video,
[9379.46 → 9380.10] just...
[9380.10 → 9383.32] just drop a quick, you know...
[9383.32 → 9385.28] Look on one of our varieties of channels.
[9385.32 → 9387.00] Drop a quick search, you know,
[9387.36 → 9387.82] Cam,
[9389.54 → 9390.56] and just, you know,
[9390.56 → 9391.50] see what happens
[9391.50 → 9394.88] because you might just find a video about it.
[9394.94 → 9397.74] We've definitely covered a lot of stuff over the years.
[9398.06 → 9399.44] Anyway, thank you for the suggestion.
[9399.44 → 9401.52] This is really exciting
[9401.52 → 9403.56] because it's...
[9403.56 → 9405.34] It's not really mentioned in our notes here,
[9405.46 → 9409.52] but the ability to run at the same speeds
[9409.52 → 9413.16] as having the packages soldered onto the main board
[9413.16 → 9414.80] is a huge advantage.
[9415.22 → 9416.28] Basically, with Sodium,
[9416.42 → 9418.76] Alex explains it in great detail in that video.
[9419.04 → 9420.62] We worked together on the script for it
[9420.62 → 9421.80] and he did an amazing job.
[9422.10 → 9422.82] But basically,
[9423.24 → 9424.14] the trace length
[9424.14 → 9426.40] is just too long
[9426.40 → 9428.42] for Sodium to keep up anymore.
[9429.38 → 9432.44] And Cam helps reduce the trace length,
[9432.56 → 9434.38] the maximum trace length,
[9434.74 → 9435.74] significantly,
[9436.02 → 9436.92] allowing us to hit
[9436.92 → 9439.42] not quite the same speeds
[9439.42 → 9440.12] as soldering
[9440.12 → 9442.42] directly on the motherboard
[9442.42 → 9443.96] or especially now
[9443.96 → 9445.76] we're seeing memory soldered,
[9445.92 → 9447.08] like, on package...
[9447.08 → 9447.56] or not soldered,
[9447.64 → 9449.86] but we're seeing memory added to the package.
[9449.86 → 9451.66] So not quite at the same level.
[9451.78 → 9452.86] But, hey, it's upgradable,
[9453.00 → 9454.74] which is an advantage for users
[9454.74 → 9456.82] and even an advantage for system builders
[9456.82 → 9458.98] who want to be able to offer multiple configurations.
[9459.94 → 9461.34] Find my device expansion.
[9461.46 → 9462.78] Oh, yeah, I got an email about this.
[9463.32 → 9464.94] Google is finally rolling out its promised
[9464.94 → 9466.26] Find my device expansion,
[9466.36 → 9467.50] which will help users locate
[9467.50 → 9469.40] both online and offline devices.
[9469.40 → 9471.54] And it works pretty much the same
[9471.54 → 9473.82] as Apple's Find my network.
[9474.72 → 9476.68] There's a billion-plus Android devices
[9476.68 → 9477.16] in the network
[9477.16 → 9478.72] that'll ping your device over Bluetooth
[9478.72 → 9479.52] if it's nearby
[9479.52 → 9481.02] and send the end-to-end
[9481.02 → 9481.92] encrypted information
[9481.92 → 9483.04] to Find my device.
[9483.26 → 9484.62] The system also stores
[9484.62 → 9486.22] recent locations with timestamps
[9486.22 → 9487.28] so it can be used
[9487.28 → 9488.42] to find offline devices.
[9488.56 → 9490.24] And as recently as a couple of weeks ago,
[9490.38 → 9492.58] we managed to get Yvonne's parse back
[9492.58 → 9494.22] using an Apple AirTag.
[9494.34 → 9497.18] This is very, really useful things.
[9497.48 → 9498.52] I told Luke about it already.
[9498.62 → 9500.58] That person was definitely going to keep it
[9500.58 → 9502.56] until I disclosed
[9502.56 → 9503.96] that there was a tracker on it
[9503.96 → 9505.04] and I was going to be able
[9505.04 → 9506.60] to make noise with it
[9506.60 → 9507.46] as soon as I got in touch
[9507.46 → 9508.90] with my son back home to ping it
[9508.90 → 9509.78] because I didn't bring an iPhone
[9509.78 → 9510.58] with me on the trip.
[9511.52 → 9513.50] Anywho, users that wish
[9513.50 → 9514.66] to opt out of the feature
[9514.66 → 9515.80] can do so through settings
[9515.80 → 9517.30] and users can also manage
[9517.30 → 9518.42] when they want to participate,
[9518.60 → 9520.04] whether it's only in high traffic areas
[9520.04 → 9521.08] or all areas.
[9521.82 → 9523.08] Perhaps, controversially,
[9523.48 → 9524.42] users have the option
[9524.42 → 9525.56] to benefit from the network
[9525.56 → 9527.14] by using it to find their device
[9527.14 → 9528.82] without participating themselves.
[9529.12 → 9530.40] I am against that.
[9530.92 → 9531.30] Yeah, me too.
[9531.30 → 9532.84] I think that if you...
[9532.84 → 9533.14] Completely agree.
[9533.28 → 9534.52] If you want to be able
[9534.52 → 9535.52] to find your device,
[9535.76 → 9536.84] I think Google should just
[9536.84 → 9537.60] draw the line here
[9537.60 → 9538.26] and basically say,
[9538.34 → 9538.46] no.
[9539.50 → 9541.36] What, you want to use the network
[9541.36 → 9543.00] to find your missing device
[9543.00 → 9543.70] but you're not going
[9543.70 → 9544.52] to contribute to it?
[9544.56 → 9545.70] Why don't you just go
[9545.70 → 9548.00] drink a nice cold glass
[9548.00 → 9548.90] of f*** off
[9548.90 → 9549.30] and...
[9550.78 → 9551.10] Because, like,
[9551.12 → 9552.14] it's not like
[9552.14 → 9552.68] it's not encrypted.
[9553.02 → 9553.82] It's like not reseeding.
[9553.82 → 9554.48] Yeah.
[9554.98 → 9555.90] Yeah, not cool.
[9556.74 → 9557.14] Yeah.
[9557.24 → 9557.88] If you're going to download
[9557.88 → 9558.50] a Linux ISO,
[9558.66 → 9559.56] you should help other people
[9559.56 → 9560.68] download Linux ISOs.
[9561.12 → 9561.52] Unfortunately,
[9561.88 → 9562.66] the purse story,
[9563.12 → 9564.18] we were in a pretty
[9564.18 → 9565.58] chaotic headspace.
[9565.76 → 9566.46] I'm not going to remember
[9566.46 → 9567.24] all the details
[9567.24 → 9569.34] but we were at Ludwig's
[9569.34 → 9569.92] for the shoot.
[9570.30 → 9571.42] We got an Uber
[9571.42 → 9572.64] back to our hotel,
[9572.78 → 9573.58] realized when we got
[9573.58 → 9574.18] to the hotel,
[9574.42 → 9574.84] holy crap,
[9574.88 → 9575.36] we don't have it.
[9575.40 → 9575.86] We assumed
[9575.86 → 9577.40] that she had accidentally
[9577.40 → 9578.28] left it in the Uber.
[9578.98 → 9579.32] Remember,
[9579.94 → 9580.62] or not remember,
[9580.72 → 9581.62] but you might not know this,
[9581.62 → 9583.90] we had pulled an all-nighter
[9583.90 → 9585.20] right before the trip
[9585.20 → 9586.36] painting Proof's car.
[9586.88 → 9587.80] She stayed up with me
[9587.80 → 9588.98] and we were working
[9588.98 → 9589.58] on it together.
[9590.74 → 9591.34] Neither of us
[9591.34 → 9593.02] was really at our best
[9593.02 → 9594.18] on that trip.
[9594.76 → 9595.52] So we assumed
[9595.52 → 9596.22] it was an Uber.
[9596.84 → 9597.96] We called the Uber driver
[9597.96 → 9598.78] because that's a feature
[9598.78 → 9599.72] and he was like,
[9599.80 → 9601.14] I have a fare right now.
[9601.74 → 9602.46] I'll check,
[9602.92 → 9603.14] you know,
[9603.14 → 9603.96] when I pull over.
[9605.30 → 9606.40] He didn't call back.
[9607.06 → 9608.14] So Yvonne calls him back later.
[9608.22 → 9608.56] He goes,
[9609.24 → 9609.40] yeah,
[9609.44 → 9610.34] I checked in the backseat.
[9610.44 → 9610.92] It's not there.
[9611.02 → 9611.38] And she goes,
[9611.38 → 9611.62] well,
[9611.90 → 9612.88] okay,
[9613.00 → 9613.82] what about the trunk?
[9614.62 → 9616.00] And he's like,
[9616.08 → 9616.68] I have a fare.
[9617.24 → 9617.90] I'll check later.
[9618.44 → 9618.82] We're like,
[9619.30 → 9620.08] okay,
[9620.32 → 9620.74] well,
[9620.84 → 9621.34] just in case
[9621.34 → 9622.20] it's not in the Uber,
[9622.78 → 9623.76] why don't we
[9623.76 → 9625.08] head back
[9625.08 → 9626.26] to Ludwig's studio?
[9626.58 → 9626.74] Yeah.
[9627.26 → 9629.10] It was not simple
[9629.10 → 9630.16] to get in touch
[9630.16 → 9632.08] with my son
[9632.08 → 9633.76] to check
[9633.76 → 9634.86] the AirTag location
[9634.86 → 9635.62] because I had left
[9635.62 → 9636.84] my iPhone back home.
[9636.94 → 9637.52] So what am I going
[9637.52 → 9638.44] to need my iPhone for?
[9638.76 → 9639.62] I'll just bring
[9639.62 → 9640.40] my regular phone.
[9641.22 → 9642.16] So we hadn't managed
[9642.16 → 9642.64] to get in touch
[9642.64 → 9643.32] with him yet.
[9643.42 → 9643.92] So we were like,
[9643.98 → 9644.16] okay,
[9644.22 → 9644.34] well,
[9644.36 → 9644.76] why don't we just
[9644.76 → 9645.62] head back to the studio?
[9645.74 → 9646.36] Maybe we accidentally
[9646.36 → 9647.20] left it in the studio.
[9648.68 → 9649.62] We got there
[9649.62 → 9650.90] and it was right around
[9650.90 → 9651.36] that time
[9651.36 → 9651.92] that we learned
[9651.92 → 9652.68] a bunch of things.
[9652.92 → 9653.68] So the driver
[9653.68 → 9655.04] got back to us eventually
[9655.04 → 9656.00] that it wasn't
[9656.00 → 9656.60] in the car.
[9656.70 → 9657.04] So we went,
[9657.24 → 9657.50] uh-oh.
[9658.30 → 9659.46] We searched the studio.
[9659.64 → 9660.22] It wasn't there.
[9660.32 → 9660.94] We got the ability
[9660.94 → 9663.22] to see where it was,
[9663.22 → 9664.04] but we couldn't
[9664.04 → 9664.68] ping it yet.
[9664.76 → 9665.38] Long story.
[9666.14 → 9666.54] Um,
[9667.38 → 9668.36] and,
[9668.96 → 9669.32] oh no,
[9669.34 → 9670.00] we could ping it,
[9670.18 → 9671.46] but we couldn't find it
[9671.46 → 9673.30] in Ludwig's studio.
[9673.46 → 9674.52] So now we're really worried.
[9675.06 → 9676.36] Now we've got the
[9676.36 → 9676.68] like,
[9676.80 → 9677.74] last known location,
[9677.86 → 9679.00] but it was a long time ago
[9679.00 → 9679.80] and it was at a park
[9679.80 → 9680.44] that was like
[9680.44 → 9682.38] a little ways away
[9682.38 → 9683.50] from Ludwig's studio.
[9683.62 → 9683.96] And we're like,
[9684.06 → 9684.28] okay,
[9684.30 → 9685.20] that's a bad sign
[9685.20 → 9686.18] because unless
[9686.18 → 9688.04] we drove past someone
[9688.04 → 9688.78] with an iPhone
[9688.78 → 9689.92] as we were leaving
[9689.92 → 9691.24] and that was the last time
[9691.24 → 9693.02] it got pinged
[9693.02 → 9693.84] and it was in the Uber,
[9694.06 → 9695.40] which the guy said it wasn't,
[9695.46 → 9695.72] but like,
[9695.74 → 9696.24] you never know.
[9696.44 → 9697.28] I had a cabbie lie
[9697.28 → 9698.16] and say that I didn't leave
[9698.16 → 9699.18] a jacket in a cab once
[9699.18 → 9700.18] and they definitely had it.
[9700.58 → 9701.94] Unless that's what happened,
[9702.60 → 9703.08] um,
[9703.70 → 9704.92] this thing is pretty lost.
[9704.96 → 9706.12] And even if that's what happened,
[9706.60 → 9707.84] this thing is pretty lost.
[9708.18 → 9708.50] Uh,
[9708.50 → 9709.50] but then it started
[9709.50 → 9710.80] to get updates more recently
[9710.80 → 9711.96] and it was just like
[9711.96 → 9712.82] at the intersection
[9712.82 → 9713.74] near this park.
[9714.22 → 9715.30] And I,
[9715.34 → 9716.58] I had already had the idea
[9716.58 → 9717.30] that if we left it
[9717.30 → 9717.90] on the sidewalk
[9717.90 → 9720.24] someone might've just grabbed it,
[9721.56 → 9722.90] Chuck been walking,
[9723.06 → 9723.24] you know,
[9723.28 → 9724.12] because you're going to be moving.
[9724.74 → 9726.62] Just ditched the tracker
[9726.62 → 9727.82] like in the park,
[9727.88 → 9728.98] just sucked it in a garbage can
[9728.98 → 9729.90] or something like that.
[9730.30 → 9730.70] And,
[9730.80 → 9731.18] and then,
[9731.22 → 9732.48] and then took the purse with them
[9732.48 → 9733.92] cause the tracker's just hanging
[9733.92 → 9735.60] in plain sight off of the purse.
[9735.70 → 9736.72] It's not like in a hidden pocket
[9736.72 → 9737.14] or anything.
[9738.04 → 9738.44] And,
[9738.64 → 9738.92] uh,
[9738.92 → 9739.98] so I had already kind of walked
[9739.98 → 9740.58] past this park
[9740.58 → 9741.86] a couple of times earlier
[9741.86 → 9743.78] and I was,
[9743.90 → 9745.38] while we were waiting and stuck
[9745.38 → 9746.42] and not able to get in touch
[9746.42 → 9747.38] with my son,
[9747.38 → 9748.14] um,
[9749.04 → 9749.48] I,
[9749.54 → 9750.86] I had suggested to Yvonne
[9750.86 → 9751.92] that we like to walk around the park
[9751.92 → 9753.18] and like look in garbage cans
[9753.18 → 9754.18] and stuff like that.
[9754.18 → 9754.58] Um,
[9754.58 → 9755.36] because it would be,
[9755.70 → 9756.48] it would be great
[9756.48 → 9758.30] if they just took the cash
[9758.30 → 9759.54] and then chucked the whole purse
[9759.54 → 9760.30] tracker included.
[9760.30 → 9761.30] So I was kind of still
[9761.30 → 9762.80] holding out for that.
[9762.80 → 9764.10] Um,
[9764.42 → 9768.22] so I didn't realize
[9768.22 → 9769.34] because I was looking
[9769.34 → 9770.18] at the find my app,
[9770.24 → 9771.12] never actually had to use it
[9771.12 → 9771.94] to find anything before.
[9772.24 → 9773.94] So I was looking at the find my app
[9773.94 → 9775.66] through my son's phone
[9775.66 → 9777.04] at the other screen
[9777.04 → 9778.90] and it's like a huge icon
[9778.90 → 9779.52] like this
[9779.52 → 9780.16] and I didn't realize
[9780.16 → 9781.34] it actually comes to a pinpoint.
[9781.82 → 9782.68] So at some point
[9782.68 → 9783.30] I realized,
[9783.42 → 9783.52] no,
[9783.56 → 9783.62] no,
[9783.66 → 9784.62] it's exactly
[9784.62 → 9786.12] at that point in the intersection
[9786.12 → 9787.48] where that weird
[9787.48 → 9789.14] like hoarder looking truck
[9789.14 → 9790.34] full of garbage
[9790.34 → 9791.90] and with like,
[9792.02 → 9792.84] uh,
[9792.92 → 9794.72] a kid and someone in it
[9794.72 → 9796.88] and clearly like
[9796.88 → 9798.20] no intention of moving.
[9798.36 → 9799.18] There's a lot of like
[9799.18 → 9800.54] RVs and stuff
[9800.54 → 9801.20] parked around.
[9801.20 → 9802.08] Like it was clearly,
[9802.08 → 9802.50] uh,
[9802.68 → 9803.06] um,
[9803.76 → 9804.82] a poorer neighbourhood
[9804.82 → 9806.16] where people were living
[9806.16 → 9807.12] out of their vehicles.
[9807.60 → 9808.08] Um,
[9808.10 → 9808.70] so clearly,
[9808.92 → 9809.12] so,
[9809.20 → 9809.84] so that vehicle
[9809.84 → 9811.14] had caught my eye before
[9811.14 → 9812.58] and now I realized
[9812.58 → 9813.18] that the pin
[9813.18 → 9814.56] was like right on it.
[9815.52 → 9816.00] Um,
[9816.04 → 9816.68] they didn't speak
[9816.68 → 9817.32] any English.
[9817.46 → 9818.82] So we,
[9819.00 → 9819.12] uh,
[9819.14 → 9819.48] um,
[9819.64 → 9821.26] we had interacted
[9821.26 → 9821.82] with them
[9821.82 → 9822.64] just sort of
[9822.64 → 9824.28] casually already
[9824.28 → 9825.58] but finally we were like,
[9825.64 → 9825.74] okay,
[9825.74 → 9826.88] well we need to talk to them
[9826.88 → 9827.98] because,
[9827.98 → 9829.28] uh,
[9829.58 → 9830.04] yeah,
[9830.06 → 9831.30] we're going to have to like
[9831.30 → 9832.48] Google Translate moment
[9832.48 → 9833.48] figure this out at some point.
[9833.54 → 9834.62] So we pull out Google Translate
[9834.62 → 9836.18] and Yvonne basically goes,
[9836.26 → 9837.20] I lost my purse.
[9837.30 → 9837.70] Um,
[9837.70 → 9838.60] have you seen a purse?
[9838.78 → 9839.54] And they go,
[9840.26 → 9840.54] no.
[9841.62 → 9842.34] And we kind of go,
[9843.30 → 9843.82] okay,
[9844.58 → 9845.16] um,
[9845.18 → 9845.54] well,
[9845.86 → 9846.98] I need to wait
[9846.98 → 9847.70] a little bit longer
[9847.70 → 9848.52] before I can ping this
[9848.52 → 9848.96] on my own
[9848.96 → 9849.64] because by then
[9849.64 → 9850.32] my son was doing
[9850.32 → 9850.86] something else
[9850.86 → 9851.44] and we couldn't just
[9851.44 → 9852.60] have liked him ping it.
[9852.80 → 9853.00] Oh,
[9853.04 → 9853.20] right.
[9853.34 → 9853.52] Oh,
[9853.58 → 9854.26] I remember why
[9854.26 → 9854.74] we couldn't just
[9854.74 → 9855.36] have him ping it
[9855.36 → 9855.74] because,
[9855.96 → 9856.20] uh,
[9856.20 → 9857.02] it wasn't near anything
[9857.02 → 9857.82] on the Find My Network.
[9858.76 → 9860.64] So we had to locate,
[9860.76 → 9861.62] the last location,
[9861.82 → 9862.40] we had the ability
[9862.40 → 9863.26] to ping it with the iPhone
[9863.26 → 9864.16] but we didn't have
[9864.16 → 9864.72] an iPhone.
[9865.18 → 9866.56] So we had to go back to,
[9866.66 → 9866.78] see,
[9866.82 → 9867.50] this is why I told you
[9867.50 → 9867.88] I was going to get
[9867.88 → 9868.48] the details wrong.
[9868.66 → 9869.54] We had to go back
[9869.54 → 9870.30] to the studio.
[9870.70 → 9872.02] My phone battery was dead
[9872.02 → 9872.80] so I couldn't call Yvonne.
[9872.80 → 9873.38] I was worried
[9873.38 → 9874.12] the truck would like
[9874.12 → 9875.92] leave because they had
[9875.92 → 9876.56] seen me kind of
[9876.56 → 9877.64] walking around a lot.
[9878.06 → 9878.42] Um,
[9878.52 → 9878.70] right,
[9878.76 → 9879.22] we had to go back
[9879.22 → 9879.60] to the studio.
[9879.70 → 9879.90] They did,
[9879.96 → 9880.60] they had an iPhone
[9880.60 → 9881.80] but it belonged to an
[9881.80 → 9882.50] employee who wasn't
[9882.50 → 9883.04] there anymore
[9883.04 → 9884.36] and they didn't have
[9884.36 → 9885.58] the pin to,
[9885.66 → 9885.92] to,
[9885.92 → 9886.80] to reset it.
[9886.90 → 9887.44] So we,
[9887.54 → 9889.08] we had to like search
[9889.08 → 9890.28] for whether a MacBook
[9890.28 → 9892.28] participates in the
[9892.28 → 9892.92] Find My Network.
[9893.22 → 9894.32] We finally got that.
[9894.38 → 9894.98] We brought it back.
[9895.14 → 9895.92] We had to connect it
[9895.92 → 9896.76] to an internet connection
[9896.76 → 9897.36] which wasn't working
[9897.36 → 9897.74] on my phone
[9897.74 → 9898.54] because my phone died
[9898.54 → 9899.22] so we had to tether it
[9899.22 → 9899.66] to Yvonne's.
[9899.70 → 9900.70] Her phone was almost dying.
[9902.32 → 9903.40] So we finally got
[9903.40 → 9903.96] to that point.
[9904.14 → 9904.84] So then we talked
[9904.84 → 9905.40] to them again
[9905.40 → 9906.60] because we'd already
[9906.60 → 9906.96] talked to them.
[9907.00 → 9907.44] We already said
[9907.44 → 9908.14] we lost the purse
[9908.14 → 9908.94] but we hadn't,
[9909.04 → 9909.78] we didn't have any way
[9909.78 → 9910.26] to ping it.
[9910.90 → 9912.58] So now we had a way
[9912.58 → 9913.14] to ping it.
[9913.56 → 9913.58] I,
[9913.78 → 9914.08] right,
[9914.16 → 9914.98] I couldn't sign in to
[9914.98 → 9916.30] my Apple ID on the MacBook
[9916.30 → 9918.04] because my 2FA was
[9918.04 → 9918.74] on my phone
[9918.74 → 9919.48] which wasn't charged.
[9919.98 → 9920.36] I had to,
[9920.46 → 9920.98] so I was like,
[9921.12 → 9921.66] I was in the middle
[9921.66 → 9922.44] of reverse charging
[9922.44 → 9924.18] while Yvonne was
[9924.18 → 9925.10] sitting there
[9925.10 → 9926.26] because there's an Android
[9926.26 → 9927.32] app that you can use
[9927.32 → 9928.66] to ping unfamiliar trackers
[9928.66 → 9929.76] but it has to be near you
[9929.76 → 9930.36] for 10 minutes.
[9930.68 → 9931.34] So we have these
[9931.34 → 9932.10] multiple timers.
[9932.28 → 9933.34] I'm trying to reverse
[9933.34 → 9935.08] wireless charge my phone.
[9935.40 → 9936.36] I'm trying to figure out
[9936.36 → 9938.10] how to log into my Apple ID
[9938.10 → 9939.00] maybe without it
[9939.00 → 9939.50] or something
[9939.50 → 9941.34] or like I can team viewer
[9941.34 → 9941.84] into something
[9941.84 → 9942.34] and get something
[9942.34 → 9943.56] and then Yvonne
[9943.56 → 9944.22] is meanwhile
[9944.22 → 9945.50] waiting for this countdown timer
[9945.50 → 9946.14] for the 10 minutes.
[9946.40 → 9947.40] So finally we get there
[9947.40 → 9947.76] and we're ready
[9947.76 → 9948.46] to talk to them again
[9948.46 → 9949.44] and we're ready to ping it
[9949.44 → 9950.28] and so I go over
[9950.28 → 9951.42] to the taco stand
[9951.42 → 9952.44] that's like on the street
[9952.44 → 9952.84] next to it.
[9952.88 → 9953.02] I'm like,
[9953.12 → 9953.24] hey,
[9953.62 → 9954.94] Google Translate moment again.
[9955.04 → 9955.32] Do you mind
[9955.32 → 9956.28] turning down your music?
[9956.46 → 9957.36] I'm trying to hear a tracker
[9957.36 → 9958.04] and we go back
[9958.04 → 9959.92] and ask one more time,
[9960.30 → 9960.76] hey,
[9961.08 → 9962.44] we've got a tracker
[9962.44 → 9963.22] on the purse
[9963.22 → 9966.50] and so
[9966.50 → 9968.48] have you seen it?
[9968.74 → 9969.64] Because it's going
[9969.64 → 9970.64] to make a noise soon.
[9971.14 → 9971.70] And they go,
[9971.76 → 9971.98] oh yeah,
[9972.04 → 9972.20] yeah,
[9972.20 → 9973.34] I was going to give it to you.
[9974.54 → 9975.92] My kid was sleeping
[9975.92 → 9976.94] so I couldn't before.
[9977.34 → 9977.78] Oh yeah.
[9977.86 → 9978.68] And we kind of go,
[9978.86 → 9979.16] totally.
[9979.16 → 9980.64] Okay.
[9982.78 → 9983.30] And she goes,
[9983.34 → 9983.48] yeah,
[9983.54 → 9983.74] yeah,
[9983.74 → 9983.78] yeah,
[9983.78 → 9986.04] I was going to give it to you
[9986.04 → 9987.26] and this is,
[9987.38 → 9987.76] oh right,
[9987.84 → 9988.90] a kid has been brought in,
[9989.12 → 9989.72] a neighbourhood kid
[9989.72 → 9990.20] has been brought in
[9990.20 → 9990.66] to translate.
[9991.38 → 9991.52] Yeah,
[9991.54 → 9991.64] yeah,
[9991.66 → 9992.84] I was going to give it to you.
[9993.18 → 9994.64] My husband found it
[9994.64 → 9997.14] and gave it to me
[9997.14 → 9999.10] and I was going to give it to you.
[9999.86 → 10000.42] And we're like,
[10001.10 → 10002.70] okay,
[10003.30 → 10005.04] anytime now.
[10005.04 → 10006.60] So,
[10007.32 → 10008.92] she goes and gets it
[10008.92 → 10010.50] and sure enough,
[10011.00 → 10011.84] it's Yvonne's purse.
[10011.94 → 10012.80] I guess they had no idea
[10012.80 → 10013.74] what an air tag was
[10013.74 → 10015.42] because it was still sitting on it.
[10015.48 → 10016.60] She hands it back to Yvonne
[10016.60 → 10019.74] who immediately opens it up
[10019.74 → 10021.06] to give her the cash as a reward
[10021.06 → 10022.32] as she's saying,
[10022.60 → 10023.76] everything's in there
[10023.76 → 10025.28] and Yvonne goes,
[10026.62 → 10026.86] oh,
[10027.00 → 10027.18] well,
[10027.36 → 10028.32] I guess you helped yourself
[10028.32 → 10029.40] to your reward already
[10029.40 → 10031.66] which may not have actually been the lady.
[10031.78 → 10032.46] It might have been
[10032.46 → 10034.00] the husband who found it
[10034.00 → 10035.60] or even someone before that
[10035.60 → 10037.08] or even someone before that
[10037.08 → 10038.10] but one way or another,
[10038.20 → 10039.18] the cash wasn't in it
[10039.18 → 10040.94] but you know what?
[10041.00 → 10041.32] Honestly,
[10041.38 → 10042.92] we were so happy to have it back
[10042.92 → 10044.56] that we had to go bother
[10044.56 → 10046.80] one of Ludwig's poor team members
[10046.80 → 10047.24] for like,
[10047.32 → 10048.72] this is probably the fourth or fifth time
[10048.72 → 10049.42] by this point
[10049.42 → 10050.96] because we went in to look for it
[10050.96 → 10052.40] and then we went in to like
[10052.40 → 10053.56] borrow an iPhone
[10053.56 → 10054.88] and then we went in to go like,
[10054.88 → 10055.10] hey,
[10055.22 → 10055.62] actually,
[10055.74 → 10056.30] how about a MacBook?
[10056.56 → 10057.10] And then we went in
[10057.10 → 10057.98] for some other reason.
[10058.10 → 10059.58] We're like ringing the door every time,
[10059.64 → 10059.76] right?
[10059.86 → 10061.32] Who the heck are these guys?
[10061.58 → 10061.76] No,
[10061.84 → 10062.92] who knew we were?
[10062.92 → 10065.30] But then the last thing we had to do
[10065.30 → 10066.84] was because we,
[10068.08 → 10070.24] no offence to anyone,
[10070.58 → 10071.90] didn't really want to walk around
[10071.90 → 10073.10] and look for an ATM.
[10074.30 → 10074.92] We're like,
[10075.02 → 10075.26] hey,
[10075.38 → 10076.38] do you have any cash?
[10076.64 → 10079.26] We can like PayPal you
[10079.26 → 10080.60] replacement cash
[10080.60 → 10081.60] but we had no cash on us
[10081.60 → 10082.72] because I don't carry it
[10082.72 → 10084.82] and Yvonne had her cash taken.
[10085.28 → 10087.04] So we still gave her a reward
[10087.04 → 10088.52] thinking maybe someone,
[10088.60 → 10089.18] because why would you,
[10089.18 → 10091.10] why would you confidently hand someone
[10091.10 → 10091.86] their purse going,
[10092.06 → 10093.10] everything's in it
[10093.10 → 10094.38] when it's not,
[10094.48 → 10095.46] when it wasn't.
[10095.46 → 10096.20] So at the very least,
[10096.28 → 10097.46] she probably didn't know
[10097.46 → 10098.88] or maybe didn't know.
[10099.06 → 10101.04] She very possibly didn't know
[10101.04 → 10102.68] and they clearly hadn't time,
[10102.80 → 10104.64] hadn't had time to go through it in detail.
[10104.82 → 10106.74] So what I suspect was Buddy picked it up,
[10107.40 → 10108.66] grabbed the cash immediately
[10108.66 → 10110.26] so that he didn't have to tell his wife
[10110.26 → 10111.08] that he had cash
[10111.08 → 10113.10] because like some relationships
[10113.10 → 10113.84] are like that
[10113.84 → 10114.46] and I can definitely,
[10114.46 → 10115.78] I definitely got a vibe
[10115.78 → 10116.88] that,
[10116.96 → 10117.32] you know,
[10117.70 → 10119.68] there might've been some dishonesty
[10119.68 → 10121.14] around.
[10121.46 → 10121.62] Yeah.
[10122.42 → 10123.14] You know,
[10123.46 → 10125.04] so probably grabbed the cash,
[10125.70 → 10126.56] dumped it in the
[10126.56 → 10129.28] in the like hoarder looking truck thing
[10129.28 → 10129.68] that was just,
[10129.78 → 10131.10] it was like full of garbage,
[10131.36 → 10132.36] like full of garbage,
[10132.88 → 10133.68] which is weird
[10133.68 → 10134.88] because there were garbage cans
[10134.88 → 10136.08] in the park that were empty.
[10136.18 → 10136.74] They could have easily
[10136.74 → 10137.68] put their garbage in there
[10137.68 → 10137.96] but no,
[10138.00 → 10139.22] they chose to keep it in their truck
[10139.22 → 10142.14] and then intended to go
[10142.14 → 10143.00] and look through it later
[10143.00 → 10143.64] is,
[10143.72 → 10144.72] is the vibe I got
[10144.72 → 10146.56] because her AirPods were still in there
[10146.56 → 10148.84] and AirPods Pros.
[10149.00 → 10150.72] Like if you have any idea
[10150.72 → 10151.20] what those are,
[10151.24 → 10152.06] that's one of the first things
[10152.06 → 10152.36] you're stealing.
[10152.36 → 10153.02] You nab those pretty quick.
[10153.14 → 10153.26] Yeah.
[10153.50 → 10153.66] Yeah.
[10153.92 → 10155.80] Her AirPods Pros were still in there.
[10156.08 → 10157.26] There were no transactions
[10157.26 → 10158.20] on any of the credit cards.
[10158.30 → 10159.18] None of them had been removed.
[10159.30 → 10159.88] Clearly they thought
[10159.88 → 10161.18] they had all the time in the world
[10161.18 → 10162.54] to come back
[10162.54 → 10163.22] and,
[10163.24 → 10164.20] and go through it
[10164.20 → 10165.58] and figure out,
[10165.62 → 10165.76] you know,
[10165.78 → 10166.46] what was the value
[10166.46 → 10167.40] other than the cash.
[10168.20 → 10168.56] So,
[10168.56 → 10169.80] so thank you.
[10170.38 → 10171.28] Thank you,
[10171.88 → 10172.22] Apple,
[10173.26 → 10174.82] for your AirTag system
[10174.82 → 10175.62] that you
[10175.62 → 10178.40] are now finally
[10178.40 → 10179.58] have done your part
[10179.58 → 10180.68] to help Google
[10180.68 → 10181.98] also have their own system
[10181.98 → 10182.76] so I don't have to buy
[10182.76 → 10183.54] your AirTags anymore
[10183.54 → 10184.52] and I'll actually be able
[10184.52 → 10186.84] to ping stuff myself
[10186.84 → 10187.80] without carrying around
[10187.80 → 10188.76] my stupid iPhone.
[10190.00 → 10190.02] But,
[10190.06 → 10191.30] but does Google have,
[10191.74 → 10192.68] like what tracker
[10192.68 → 10193.32] can we get
[10193.32 → 10194.14] on the Google side?
[10194.22 → 10194.32] Well,
[10194.34 → 10194.50] they'll,
[10194.60 → 10195.04] they'll be coming.
[10195.26 → 10195.52] Okay.
[10195.72 → 10195.90] Yeah.
[10196.08 → 10196.30] Yeah.
[10196.30 → 10196.88] I'm very excited.
[10197.50 → 10197.82] It's going to be,
[10197.82 → 10198.58] that'll be really nice.
[10202.64 → 10203.00] Yeah.
[10203.34 → 10203.60] Yeah.
[10203.60 → 10204.02] I'm,
[10204.02 → 10206.56] I'm very,
[10206.56 → 10208.60] very happy
[10208.60 → 10210.00] that we got it back.
[10210.46 → 10212.10] We ended up giving,
[10212.36 → 10213.34] we offered them a meal
[10213.34 → 10214.64] because there was
[10214.64 → 10215.66] the food stand right there
[10215.66 → 10216.22] and they were like,
[10216.28 → 10216.36] no,
[10216.40 → 10217.00] I don't want that.
[10217.42 → 10218.48] And so we went
[10218.48 → 10219.10] and got cash
[10219.10 → 10219.68] and brought it back.
[10219.76 → 10219.98] I'm like,
[10220.02 → 10220.28] okay.
[10221.04 → 10221.36] Sure.
[10221.48 → 10221.80] Sure.
[10222.26 → 10222.66] Sure.
[10222.74 → 10222.98] Fine.
[10222.98 → 10226.14] I decided on $60
[10226.14 → 10227.26] for those of you
[10227.26 → 10227.78] who must know.
[10228.30 → 10229.62] I felt like that was,
[10230.30 → 10231.28] there were apparently
[10231.28 → 10231.92] three of them
[10231.92 → 10232.86] so they can get
[10232.86 → 10233.78] some food
[10233.78 → 10235.64] and I figure
[10235.64 → 10236.38] I didn't owe them
[10236.38 → 10237.42] any more
[10237.42 → 10238.32] than the bare minimum
[10238.32 → 10239.36] since.
[10239.36 → 10240.14] I mean,
[10240.18 → 10240.50] they weren't,
[10240.60 → 10241.36] they were clearly
[10241.36 → 10242.02] not intending
[10242.02 → 10242.74] on giving it back.
[10242.80 → 10243.24] One of them
[10243.24 → 10243.78] or another
[10243.78 → 10245.26] already had our cash
[10245.26 → 10246.38] and the other one
[10246.38 → 10247.60] clearly didn't intend
[10247.60 → 10248.18] to give us back
[10248.18 → 10249.06] the rest of the stuff.
[10249.22 → 10249.38] Yeah.
[10249.48 → 10249.66] I was like,
[10249.66 → 10250.48] what are you talking about
[10250.48 → 10251.44] you were going to return it?
[10251.78 → 10252.94] If you're going to return it,
[10252.96 → 10253.94] you could have easily
[10253.94 → 10255.74] found the phone number
[10255.74 → 10256.54] in it and called it.
[10256.64 → 10257.50] That would have been an option.
[10257.50 → 10258.78] Um,
[10259.32 → 10259.74] anyway,
[10259.94 → 10261.64] it was very,
[10261.84 → 10262.40] very stressful.
[10262.54 → 10263.48] This was like the
[10263.48 → 10265.08] first day
[10265.08 → 10266.04] of our trip.
[10266.52 → 10266.92] Second,
[10267.06 → 10267.84] this was the second day
[10267.84 → 10268.24] of our trip
[10268.24 → 10269.38] and we had two more days
[10269.38 → 10270.08] to come
[10270.08 → 10271.52] and it would have just been,
[10272.04 → 10272.40] fortunately,
[10272.66 → 10273.16] her passport
[10273.16 → 10274.58] was not in there.
[10274.94 → 10275.34] Yeah.
[10275.56 → 10276.46] She had her passport
[10276.46 → 10277.06] separate.
[10277.74 → 10279.22] Never have everything together.
[10279.72 → 10280.92] Some countries force you
[10280.92 → 10281.88] to walk around
[10281.88 → 10282.44] with your passport.
[10282.66 → 10284.58] That is utterly insane.
[10284.70 → 10284.90] Yeah.
[10285.40 → 10286.20] But it is a thing.
[10286.20 → 10287.68] But if that's not the case,
[10287.88 → 10289.74] leave it in your hotel safe.
[10290.62 → 10290.90] Uh,
[10290.94 → 10291.62] we should get on
[10291.62 → 10292.20] to merch messages
[10292.20 → 10293.14] because I have about
[10293.14 → 10293.98] six minutes.
[10294.94 → 10295.34] Uh,
[10295.42 → 10295.64] oh,
[10295.80 → 10296.40] I'll do,
[10296.50 → 10297.32] I'll do some more.
[10297.46 → 10298.56] I can do some more time
[10298.56 → 10298.92] than that,
[10299.00 → 10299.22] but,
[10299.66 → 10300.08] um,
[10300.78 → 10300.98] yeah,
[10300.98 → 10301.26] let's,
[10301.36 → 10302.22] let's after dark it.
[10303.84 → 10305.06] That's the wrong button.
[10313.68 → 10314.64] I've already done it.
[10315.06 → 10315.30] Oh.
[10316.20 → 10317.30] On this side.
[10317.36 → 10318.14] I have a remote.
[10318.52 → 10318.80] Wow.
[10319.58 → 10319.92] Thanks,
[10319.98 → 10320.16] Andy.
[10320.36 → 10320.66] Nice,
[10320.74 → 10320.92] Dan.
[10322.46 → 10323.00] Good job.
[10324.42 → 10324.60] Oh,
[10324.62 → 10325.28] that wasn't me leaving.
[10326.10 → 10326.90] I was trying to adjust
[10326.90 → 10327.34] the lights.
[10328.26 → 10328.88] I got you.
[10328.88 → 10330.14] Howdy,
[10330.14 → 10330.16] howdy,
[10330.24 → 10330.58] LLD.
[10330.82 → 10332.14] I'm back in graduate school
[10332.14 → 10332.92] after 20 years
[10332.92 → 10333.50] in a job
[10333.50 → 10334.34] where priorities
[10334.34 → 10335.18] were obvious.
[10335.52 → 10336.26] How do you prioritize
[10336.26 → 10337.64] when tasks are numerous?
[10337.78 → 10337.88] Wait,
[10337.88 → 10338.54] you already gave us that one.
[10338.54 → 10339.20] I already gave you that one.
[10339.24 → 10339.88] It was so long ago.
[10340.24 → 10340.94] Farmer in Nebraska
[10340.94 → 10342.00] and solar storms
[10342.00 → 10343.34] are wreaking havoc
[10343.34 → 10344.10] today.
[10344.60 → 10346.04] Interference with our GPS systems
[10346.04 → 10347.46] needs to be precision
[10347.46 → 10349.94] and has brought planting
[10349.94 → 10350.68] to a halt
[10350.68 → 10351.62] across the state.
[10351.82 → 10352.60] Needed for precision.
[10352.66 → 10352.78] Oh,
[10352.84 → 10353.84] precision agriculture.
[10354.26 → 10354.42] Yeah.
[10354.42 → 10354.90] Oh,
[10354.94 → 10355.68] that's interesting.
[10356.78 → 10358.14] Scary to an industry.
[10358.52 → 10359.00] Thoughts.
[10359.22 → 10359.48] Yeah,
[10359.60 → 10359.96] that's,
[10360.08 → 10361.48] that is an impact
[10361.48 → 10363.42] of solar storms
[10363.42 → 10364.62] that I would not
[10364.62 → 10365.94] personally have thought of.
[10366.00 → 10366.12] I mean,
[10366.14 → 10366.34] neither.
[10367.88 → 10368.36] Thoughts,
[10368.44 → 10369.32] it's not going to happen
[10369.32 → 10369.78] that often,
[10370.04 → 10370.54] I think.
[10371.54 → 10372.10] Unless it does,
[10372.18 → 10372.54] I don't know.
[10372.68 → 10372.94] Yeah,
[10373.02 → 10373.28] maybe.
[10373.60 → 10373.80] Yeah,
[10374.00 → 10374.62] solar warming.
[10376.14 → 10376.60] Solar,
[10376.80 → 10377.34] solar climate change.
[10377.34 → 10378.24] I think it goes the other way.
[10378.30 → 10379.20] Solar climate change.
[10379.20 → 10379.74] I think they usually
[10379.74 → 10380.38] get colder.
[10383.00 → 10383.44] Yeah.
[10383.44 → 10385.06] Unless they don't.
[10385.34 → 10386.32] Unless they get a lot hotter.
[10386.74 → 10387.12] And bigger.
[10390.42 → 10390.82] Yikes.
[10391.20 → 10391.60] Thoughts.
[10391.64 → 10392.08] I don't know.
[10392.30 → 10392.62] All right.
[10392.84 → 10393.48] What's next one?
[10393.72 → 10395.96] We'll have to embrace tradition.
[10396.12 → 10396.30] Yeah,
[10396.36 → 10397.40] Luke's got to go pretty quick.
[10397.40 → 10398.84] Oh my goodness.
[10401.32 → 10401.76] Apparently,
[10402.28 → 10403.32] the largest storm
[10403.32 → 10404.64] is going to be here
[10404.64 → 10406.00] about 10 p.m.
[10406.00 → 10406.52] to 2 a.m.
[10406.54 → 10406.70] today.
[10406.70 → 10408.26] If we can get outside.
[10408.82 → 10408.96] Oh,
[10409.04 → 10410.36] to see the northern lights.
[10410.56 → 10410.82] I have,
[10411.14 → 10411.92] living in Canada,
[10412.12 → 10413.36] I have still never seen them.
[10413.44 → 10413.68] Well,
[10413.72 → 10414.00] me neither,
[10414.08 → 10414.86] because most of the time
[10414.86 → 10415.58] that they announce them,
[10415.68 → 10415.96] it's just,
[10416.06 → 10416.90] you're not going to see it here.
[10416.98 → 10417.64] But theoretically,
[10417.82 → 10418.24] this one,
[10418.32 → 10418.70] you like,
[10418.82 → 10419.56] actually might.
[10419.70 → 10420.04] Sick.
[10420.28 → 10420.92] Because they're always like,
[10420.96 → 10421.12] oh,
[10421.18 → 10422.16] you can see it in Vancouver.
[10422.36 → 10423.00] And you go outside,
[10423.04 → 10423.28] and it's like,
[10423.36 → 10423.70] no,
[10423.80 → 10424.80] you really can't.
[10424.80 → 10424.96] Well,
[10424.96 → 10426.46] it's always overcast here,
[10426.54 → 10427.16] so that's an issue.
[10427.40 → 10428.22] Maybe these.
[10428.38 → 10429.74] Biggest one since 2005.
[10430.14 → 10430.42] Sick.
[10430.68 → 10430.82] Hi,
[10430.90 → 10431.20] LLD.
[10431.32 → 10431.96] Do you think Linux
[10431.96 → 10433.80] will ever gain competitive market share
[10433.80 → 10434.94] in the new consumer space?
[10435.00 → 10435.26] Yes.
[10436.18 → 10436.54] Okay.
[10436.54 → 10437.78] It already is happening.
[10438.36 → 10438.92] Exhibit A,
[10439.16 → 10439.70] Steam Deck.
[10439.96 → 10440.14] Yeah.
[10440.62 → 10441.06] Sick.
[10441.50 → 10443.10] And if Valve ever releases SteamOS,
[10443.22 → 10443.34] man,
[10443.38 → 10446.38] I would seriously consider running SteamOS
[10446.38 → 10447.12] for like,
[10447.18 → 10448.16] a media centre PC.
[10448.50 → 10448.52] Oh,
[10448.60 → 10448.78] absolutely.
[10448.78 → 10449.36] Like a TV,
[10449.60 → 10449.82] man,
[10450.18 → 10452.28] the console-like experience of SteamOS,
[10452.58 → 10453.42] very cool.
[10453.70 → 10453.82] Yeah.
[10453.82 → 10454.54] Very awesome.
[10455.50 → 10455.66] Hey,
[10455.80 → 10456.32] LDL,
[10456.42 → 10457.04] love the WEN show.
[10457.18 → 10458.58] Curious what you guys think about the future,
[10458.68 → 10460.10] where AI plays a role in government
[10460.10 → 10462.14] in an effort to eliminate the inherited flaws
[10462.14 → 10463.00] of being human,
[10463.46 → 10463.66] greed,
[10463.80 → 10464.00] power,
[10464.08 → 10464.34] bias,
[10464.46 → 10464.72] et cetera.
[10464.82 → 10464.98] Well,
[10465.04 → 10466.78] those last three things that you just said
[10466.78 → 10469.44] are all the reasons that they're not going to allow AI
[10469.44 → 10470.40] to make those decisions,
[10470.40 → 10473.32] because then they wouldn't get the benefits of their greed,
[10473.48 → 10473.72] power,
[10473.72 → 10474.48] and bias.
[10474.90 → 10475.04] Yeah.
[10475.04 → 10482.76] I think it'll take a long time for AI to play a significant role there,
[10482.76 → 10486.76] because it's pretty obvious that they have no interest in logic
[10486.76 → 10490.88] and doing whatever is sort of clearly the most correct thing.
[10491.02 → 10494.78] I also think that there's a huge chance for when we start doing that,
[10494.86 → 10500.40] those systems become compromised and then utilized in like office space,
[10500.54 → 10500.78] you know,
[10500.78 → 10504.96] scrape the pennies off style ways that are going to be difficult to notice
[10504.96 → 10509.56] with lacking oversight and cause extremely major problems.
[10510.10 → 10510.82] After trying Windows,
[10510.96 → 10511.18] Mac,
[10511.32 → 10512.08] and Linux,
[10512.08 → 10516.58] I've found that all are missing some great features from one another.
[10517.06 → 10520.08] What feature do you think should be universally implemented by operating systems?
[10520.36 → 10520.82] Sleep that works.
[10521.44 → 10521.94] Got them,
[10522.04 → 10522.28] Windows.
[10522.62 → 10525.00] Stop turning yourself on to do updates and then crashing.
[10525.32 → 10526.70] Stop turning yourself on at all.
[10526.94 → 10527.90] If I turn you off,
[10528.12 → 10529.02] stay off.
[10529.44 → 10529.76] Period.
[10530.02 → 10531.20] Wake timers do nothing.
[10533.16 → 10533.60] No,
[10533.68 → 10534.66] there's no super checks tonight,
[10534.74 → 10534.90] guys.
[10536.40 → 10538.18] What features do you think should be universally?
[10538.36 → 10538.60] I mean,
[10539.80 → 10541.56] I thought operating systems are like,
[10541.56 → 10542.82] I don't,
[10542.90 → 10544.06] you don't interface with it that much.
[10544.06 → 10544.34] Yeah,
[10544.40 → 10545.46] I really don't have that much.
[10545.50 → 10549.20] I use my browser so much more than I use the operating system itself.
[10549.42 → 10552.48] It makes me sad that more websites aren't services,
[10552.48 → 10553.42] but I understand.
[10553.62 → 10557.58] Like I probably interact with Steam more than I interact with Windows.
[10557.94 → 10559.02] If you think about it.
[10559.02 → 10559.28] Yeah.
[10559.88 → 10560.24] Yeah,
[10560.24 → 10560.80] I think I agree.
[10561.44 → 10562.14] To be honest.
[10562.44 → 10563.58] Because I launch a computer,
[10563.72 → 10564.38] I make sure Team,
[10564.50 → 10564.78] Slack,
[10564.84 → 10565.58] and Chrome are open.
[10567.78 → 10568.80] I'm done?
[10569.74 → 10570.24] I'm trying to think of...
[10570.24 → 10570.76] If I'm working?
[10571.52 → 10572.14] Snipping tool?
[10573.12 → 10573.46] Yeah.
[10573.62 → 10573.92] You know?
[10574.02 → 10574.20] Like,
[10574.26 → 10574.96] like what...
[10574.96 → 10575.62] But then they all,
[10575.74 → 10576.70] do they not all...
[10576.70 → 10577.32] What do I...
[10577.32 → 10578.62] I know Linux and Windows has the big tool.
[10578.62 → 10578.80] Oh,
[10578.80 → 10578.92] no,
[10578.92 → 10578.98] no,
[10578.98 → 10579.98] I'm not saying as a feature.
[10580.06 → 10582.14] I'm just trying to think of other things I need to have opened.
[10582.14 → 10582.38] Yeah,
[10582.46 → 10583.42] like almost nothing.
[10583.52 → 10584.26] Your clock?
[10584.26 → 10585.24] For work anyway.
[10585.90 → 10586.08] Yeah,
[10586.36 → 10586.72] sure.
[10588.34 → 10588.78] Man,
[10588.94 → 10591.16] does it bother you as much as it bothers me
[10591.16 → 10593.96] that you can't click on the time in the corner
[10593.96 → 10596.62] and get a second hand anymore on Windows 11?
[10596.70 → 10596.84] Oh,
[10596.86 → 10596.98] yeah,
[10597.02 → 10597.34] it's dumb.
[10597.82 → 10599.12] What the heck?
[10599.22 → 10602.68] I use it as just like a timer clock.
[10602.90 → 10604.42] But why?
[10605.02 → 10606.16] Just give it back.
[10606.20 → 10609.62] And why did you take away the very bottom right show desktop thing?
[10609.70 → 10611.00] And you can turn it back on,
[10611.06 → 10611.56] which is nice.
[10611.72 → 10612.32] Do you use that,
[10612.56 → 10612.80] by the way?
[10612.88 → 10614.14] Click all the way down in the bottom right.
[10614.14 → 10614.68] Show the desktop?
[10615.26 → 10615.36] Yeah.
[10615.38 → 10616.48] Mine is turned back on.
[10616.54 → 10616.70] Yeah,
[10616.80 → 10617.10] it's like,
[10617.20 → 10619.10] why did you remove this?
[10619.10 → 10619.78] Not on this computer,
[10619.92 → 10620.12] mind you,
[10620.18 → 10621.08] but on my computer at home it is.
[10621.08 → 10622.46] It wasn't in the way of anything.
[10622.80 → 10623.84] That was the whole point.
[10626.34 → 10626.70] Oh.
[10628.82 → 10630.38] It's reminding me to take my antibiotics.
[10630.80 → 10631.00] Ah.
[10631.36 → 10631.54] Yeah.
[10633.98 → 10636.04] I'm patiently waiting for the precision screwdriver.
[10636.22 → 10637.34] Is there any new news on it?
[10637.66 → 10639.00] Are you really patiently waiting,
[10639.10 → 10639.22] though?
[10640.76 → 10642.08] If you message me about it,
[10642.40 → 10643.10] are you patient?
[10643.10 → 10644.90] I paid money to ask you about it.
[10645.90 → 10646.30] Yeah,
[10646.36 → 10648.14] that seems like the opposite of patience.
[10648.14 → 10648.58] To be clear,
[10648.60 → 10649.20] I'm not complaining.
[10650.42 → 10652.24] But it doesn't seem patient,
[10652.36 → 10652.96] is all I'm saying.
[10653.44 → 10653.78] Soon.
[10654.16 → 10654.52] Soon,
[10654.60 → 10655.14] my pretties,
[10655.26 → 10656.58] I think we ran into
[10656.58 → 10659.04] a weird complication
[10659.04 → 10660.70] where it turns out
[10660.70 → 10663.66] that another major precision screwdriver vendor
[10663.66 → 10666.74] got the tolerances backwards.
[10666.74 → 10668.14] So,
[10668.30 → 10669.46] instead of having
[10669.46 → 10671.12] the bits
[10671.12 → 10672.50] be exactly
[10672.50 → 10674.26] UND exactly a size
[10674.26 → 10676.60] and then accounting for tolerance
[10676.60 → 10677.20] in the bits
[10677.20 → 10679.08] by having the female side
[10679.08 → 10680.26] and their driver be bigger,
[10680.84 → 10682.10] they made the female side
[10682.10 → 10682.66] of the driver
[10682.66 → 10683.62] be exactly
[10683.62 → 10685.22] UND exactly the size
[10685.22 → 10686.46] and had their bits
[10686.46 → 10687.58] be smaller
[10687.58 → 10689.04] to account for tolerance issues.
[10689.04 → 10689.92] So,
[10690.52 → 10691.12] the standard
[10691.12 → 10691.74] is basically
[10691.74 → 10692.96] because this is
[10692.96 → 10693.84] a major vendor
[10693.84 → 10695.16] and so
[10695.16 → 10696.26] we did it
[10696.26 → 10697.18] correctly
[10697.18 → 10699.18] which would have made
[10699.18 → 10700.38] at the edges
[10700.38 → 10701.24] of tolerances
[10701.24 → 10703.02] our driver
[10703.02 → 10703.90] incompatible
[10703.90 → 10704.98] with third-party bits.
[10705.50 → 10705.88] Ah.
[10706.74 → 10707.58] Not because
[10707.58 → 10708.64] we did anything wrong.
[10709.30 → 10709.90] So,
[10709.96 → 10710.50] these are the kinds
[10710.50 → 10711.28] of things that,
[10711.36 → 10712.22] hey,
[10712.34 → 10712.58] you know,
[10712.74 → 10712.92] you,
[10713.56 → 10714.56] that's why you do
[10714.56 → 10715.54] pre-production runs
[10715.54 → 10716.22] and that's why
[10716.22 → 10717.04] you do validation
[10717.04 → 10717.62] and testing
[10717.62 → 10719.58] and everything
[10719.58 → 10720.18] will be okay.
[10720.36 → 10720.76] This is why
[10720.76 → 10721.68] hardware is difficult.
[10722.14 → 10723.06] We're going to do it wrong
[10723.06 → 10723.96] basically
[10723.96 → 10724.98] in order to maintain
[10724.98 → 10725.52] compatibility
[10725.52 → 10726.44] as best we can.
[10726.62 → 10726.88] Fair enough.
[10726.92 → 10727.66] But we're unhappy
[10727.66 → 10728.28] about it
[10728.28 → 10729.76] and we're going to gripe.
[10730.88 → 10732.44] I use my LTT driver
[10732.44 → 10734.46] to remove a GPS tracking device
[10734.46 → 10735.98] and ignition cutoff
[10735.98 → 10738.08] for my 2013 Ford Fiesta.
[10738.50 → 10739.18] Have you ever found
[10739.18 → 10740.14] a device or tech
[10740.14 → 10740.74] installed where
[10740.74 → 10741.46] it shouldn't have been?
[10741.54 → 10742.78] I blame the dealership.
[10745.54 → 10746.70] That sounds wild.
[10746.70 → 10747.64] Is that from like a
[10747.64 → 10748.22] like a
[10748.22 → 10748.98] like a lease
[10748.98 → 10749.82] or like a...
[10749.82 → 10751.06] I think you're in a movie now.
[10751.52 → 10751.86] I think,
[10751.96 → 10752.76] I think you get to
[10752.76 → 10754.36] be the star of a movie now.
[10754.70 → 10755.64] That's wild.
[10756.20 → 10757.08] I wonder if it was a lease
[10757.08 → 10758.02] that they sold
[10758.02 → 10759.02] and then it was just
[10759.02 → 10759.80] still there.
[10760.86 → 10761.30] Maybe.
[10761.44 → 10762.46] Or maybe so they can...
[10762.46 → 10763.04] Maybe it was a rental car
[10763.04 → 10764.24] that the dealership
[10764.24 → 10764.72] then sold.
[10764.94 → 10765.52] Dealerships sell
[10765.52 → 10766.42] a lot of rental cars
[10766.42 → 10767.46] and a Ford Fiesta
[10767.46 → 10768.94] would have been very...
[10768.94 → 10770.40] Or maybe it was a finance deal
[10770.40 → 10771.60] and it's there
[10771.60 → 10772.82] so that they can redo it.
[10774.08 → 10775.52] That actually seems like,
[10775.54 → 10776.30] man,
[10776.36 → 10776.84] all of those,
[10777.94 → 10779.48] all of them are dystopian
[10779.48 → 10781.52] and all of them seem
[10781.52 → 10783.14] plausibly likely.
[10783.74 → 10784.00] Yeah.
[10784.50 → 10785.64] I hate all of it.
[10786.88 → 10788.16] Third question for Luke.
[10788.62 → 10789.50] At a pet store
[10789.50 → 10790.32] in Conquire,
[10790.76 → 10791.14] Confer,
[10791.50 → 10792.66] when he sees
[10792.66 → 10794.10] my 18-month-old son
[10794.10 → 10794.84] gets as...
[10794.84 → 10796.68] It's not in Confer.
[10796.86 → 10797.16] It's...
[10797.16 → 10798.26] Confer is a type of bird.
[10798.42 → 10798.86] It's a type of parrot.
[10798.86 → 10799.14] At a pet store,
[10799.26 → 10799.90] a Confer.
[10800.08 → 10800.64] Oh, sorry.
[10801.06 → 10801.88] I'm trying to go quickly.
[10802.08 → 10803.34] I'm not doing very good right now.
[10803.34 → 10803.68] It's all good.
[10803.68 → 10805.08] At a pet store,
[10805.38 → 10806.24] a Confer,
[10806.38 → 10808.02] when he sees
[10808.02 → 10810.34] my 18-month-old son
[10810.34 → 10812.34] gets as close as possible
[10812.34 → 10812.72] to him,
[10812.92 → 10813.82] turns on his side
[10813.82 → 10815.32] and rolls into the glass
[10815.32 → 10815.86] of the cage.
[10815.94 → 10816.56] Is this a good
[10816.56 → 10817.36] or bad behaviour?
[10817.72 → 10818.08] I don't know
[10818.08 → 10819.00] Conyers super well.
[10819.14 → 10819.58] I would say
[10819.58 → 10820.48] that's a good behaviour.
[10820.48 → 10820.94] It's a funny one.
[10821.62 → 10823.68] Conyers are very hand-friendly
[10823.68 → 10825.02] and they like to cuddle
[10825.02 → 10825.80] and stuff like that.
[10825.88 → 10827.52] So he probably feels safe
[10827.52 → 10828.66] and wants to cuddle
[10828.66 → 10829.76] and be friendly and nice.
[10829.76 → 10831.08] I would read that
[10831.08 → 10832.72] as a very notably
[10832.72 → 10833.58] positive behaviour.
[10833.92 → 10835.16] But I've never had those birds.
[10835.22 → 10836.16] I don't 100% know.
[10836.56 → 10837.92] But I would say it's good.
[10839.88 → 10841.06] 80085.dll.
[10841.28 → 10841.98] I'm looking forward
[10841.98 → 10842.52] to watching
[10842.52 → 10843.60] the Borderlands movie
[10843.60 → 10844.40] when it comes out,
[10844.44 → 10845.28] even if it's bad.
[10845.50 → 10846.76] What video game movies
[10846.76 → 10848.86] were you excited about?
[10849.22 → 10849.50] Also,
[10849.68 → 10850.80] more Tall Shirts win.
[10851.02 → 10851.74] Thanks for all you do.
[10852.00 → 10852.42] I was excited
[10852.42 → 10853.20] about the Warcraft movie
[10853.20 → 10854.52] and I hated it.
[10856.76 → 10857.60] Hated it.
[10857.60 → 10858.34] Wow.
[10858.44 → 10859.22] Tell me how you really feel.
[10859.22 → 10859.64] I went to go see
[10859.64 → 10860.14] with my brother
[10860.14 → 10860.60] and we were both
[10860.60 → 10861.36] just like mad
[10861.36 → 10862.14] the whole time.
[10863.14 → 10864.12] It was annoying.
[10865.48 → 10866.08] People were saying,
[10866.22 → 10866.38] why?
[10866.52 → 10867.18] It shouldn't have been
[10867.18 → 10867.74] live action.
[10867.88 → 10868.62] That was dumb.
[10868.90 → 10869.78] Blizzard has like
[10869.78 → 10871.56] historically amazing
[10871.56 → 10872.32] cinematic.
[10872.60 → 10874.54] They basically always did
[10874.54 → 10875.66] and always have.
[10875.74 → 10875.84] Yeah,
[10875.86 → 10876.76] them and Square soft
[10876.76 → 10877.32] were like
[10877.32 → 10878.18] cased here.
[10878.18 → 10878.84] Killed it.
[10879.14 → 10879.76] And then they released
[10879.76 → 10881.08] a live action movie
[10881.08 → 10883.04] which was just weird.
[10883.20 → 10884.06] And then they worked
[10884.06 → 10884.86] a bunch of the lore
[10884.86 → 10885.66] which was like,
[10885.80 → 10886.40] what are you doing?
[10886.78 → 10887.42] You are made, bro?
[10887.42 → 10888.20] You have like a bunch
[10888.20 → 10889.00] of the like weirdest,
[10889.20 → 10889.60] nerdiest,
[10889.72 → 10890.66] lore heavy fans
[10890.66 → 10891.46] and then you're just like,
[10891.50 → 10891.80] ah,
[10891.86 → 10892.66] we'll change some stuff.
[10893.24 → 10893.72] You are made, bro?
[10893.74 → 10893.92] What?
[10894.28 → 10894.62] Yeah.
[10895.58 → 10896.06] I was.
[10896.62 → 10896.82] Yeah.
[10898.24 → 10898.98] Do you have a habit
[10898.98 → 10900.40] of periodically downloading
[10900.40 → 10901.52] your account data
[10901.52 → 10902.28] from the products
[10902.28 → 10903.36] and services you use?
[10903.52 → 10904.50] The last time I remember
[10904.50 → 10905.82] doing so was to see
[10905.82 → 10906.90] where my brother's friend
[10906.90 → 10908.18] spent his V-Bucks.
[10908.76 → 10909.62] I don't.
[10910.64 → 10911.36] I mean,
[10911.48 → 10911.80] yeah,
[10911.84 → 10912.38] I could see that
[10912.38 → 10913.46] maybe being useful,
[10913.68 → 10913.98] you know,
[10914.76 → 10915.36] in case,
[10915.74 → 10916.30] who knows,
[10916.30 → 10916.48] you know,
[10916.52 → 10917.36] Amazon decides
[10917.36 → 10919.24] to stop showing you
[10919.24 → 10920.40] all of your previous purchases
[10920.40 → 10921.52] or something like that,
[10921.56 → 10921.70] right?
[10921.76 → 10921.92] Like,
[10922.02 → 10922.18] yeah,
[10922.18 → 10922.96] I could see it being useful,
[10923.08 → 10923.34] but no,
[10923.40 → 10924.06] I really don't make
[10924.06 → 10924.62] a habit of it.
[10924.88 → 10925.50] I don't either.
[10925.66 → 10926.14] I probably should.
[10927.08 → 10927.44] Yeah.
[10929.08 → 10929.40] Hey,
[10929.58 → 10930.12] LLD,
[10930.36 → 10931.70] I'm a hiring manager
[10931.70 → 10932.50] and just got done
[10932.50 → 10933.86] with an on-site interview
[10933.86 → 10934.60] where the candidate
[10934.60 → 10935.94] was technically sound
[10935.94 → 10937.80] but not a behavioural fit.
[10938.18 → 10939.68] How do you screen for both
[10939.68 → 10940.96] given limited interview time?
[10940.96 → 10941.30] Actually,
[10941.34 → 10942.26] really like that wording.
[10942.92 → 10943.36] Yeah.
[10943.36 → 10945.22] Not a behavioural fit.
[10946.02 → 10946.22] Yeah,
[10946.28 → 10946.64] I do,
[10946.76 → 10947.76] I do what I call
[10947.76 → 10949.30] culture fit interviews
[10949.30 → 10950.24] and then I do
[10950.24 → 10951.14] technical interviews
[10951.14 → 10951.62] afterwards.
[10951.86 → 10952.70] And to be clear,
[10952.82 → 10954.06] like a culture fit
[10954.06 → 10955.22] does not mean
[10955.22 → 10956.78] discriminatory.
[10957.44 → 10957.68] It means,
[10958.02 → 10958.12] Oh, yeah.
[10958.42 → 10959.46] I absolutely
[10959.46 → 10961.08] need to work with you
[10961.08 → 10961.98] on a daily basis
[10961.98 → 10963.00] and I have to make sure
[10963.00 → 10964.02] that that's not going to make
[10964.02 → 10964.92] both of us want to blow
[10964.92 → 10965.50] our brains out.
[10965.88 → 10966.06] Yeah.
[10966.44 → 10967.08] Yvonne asked me
[10967.08 → 10968.50] some hilarious questions
[10968.50 → 10970.60] and it was a very good interview.
[10970.96 → 10971.82] I mean,
[10971.94 → 10972.14] yeah,
[10972.24 → 10972.58] it's Yvonne,
[10972.68 → 10973.40] so I'm sure it was.
[10975.00 → 10976.16] I also have asked
[10976.16 → 10977.32] some hilarious questions
[10977.32 → 10977.92] but I don't think
[10977.92 → 10978.64] anyone would say
[10978.64 → 10979.46] they had a good interview.
[10980.78 → 10982.16] I liked my interview.
[10982.40 → 10983.62] It was really long.
[10984.24 → 10984.56] Well, yeah,
[10984.64 → 10984.80] I mean,
[10984.84 → 10985.86] if you're going to hire someone
[10985.86 → 10987.18] then you should take the time,
[10987.24 → 10987.36] right?
[10987.48 → 10987.74] Oh, yeah,
[10987.78 → 10988.44] but wasn't ours
[10988.44 → 10989.94] like hours and hours long?
[10990.06 → 10990.58] I don't remember.
[10990.88 → 10991.64] Didn't you have to get dinner
[10991.64 → 10992.24] in the middle of it?
[10992.30 → 10992.80] I think you've talked
[10992.80 → 10993.34] about it before.
[10993.46 → 10994.36] You drove me home
[10994.36 → 10995.42] because all the buses
[10995.42 → 10996.00] shut down.
[10996.26 → 10997.26] I showed up immediately
[10997.26 → 10997.92] after school.
[10997.92 → 10998.98] It was like,
[10999.08 → 10999.24] I think,
[10999.24 → 10999.36] see,
[10999.94 → 11000.84] monster right here.
[11000.96 → 11002.96] It was like 4.30,
[11003.04 → 11003.94] 5 p.m. is
[11003.94 → 11005.14] and then by the time
[11005.14 → 11005.94] we were done the interview
[11005.94 → 11007.40] the bus system had shut down
[11007.40 → 11008.28] and it was dark out.
[11011.18 → 11012.20] This is cool.
[11012.44 → 11013.88] Agent J.I.
[11014.14 → 11014.58] something.
[11015.18 → 11016.54] I have the interview
[11016.54 → 11017.74] then I give them a tour.
[11018.42 → 11020.08] The tour really helps
[11020.08 → 11020.98] figure out their interests
[11020.98 → 11021.44] and personality.
[11021.56 → 11022.72] That's a perfect idea.
[11022.80 → 11023.32] That's cool.
[11023.42 → 11024.52] I like that a lot, actually.
[11024.68 → 11025.52] That's really clever.
[11025.88 → 11026.96] I've thought for a while.
[11026.96 → 11027.54] That's super cool.
[11027.62 → 11028.10] I like that.
[11028.10 → 11028.74] I start like playing
[11028.74 → 11029.92] tape to tape with people
[11029.92 → 11030.42] or something.
[11030.58 → 11030.78] Yeah.
[11030.94 → 11032.58] Because like doing an activity
[11032.58 → 11033.36] with someone I think
[11033.36 → 11034.48] is extremely informative.
[11034.60 → 11034.96] Yeah.
[11035.26 → 11036.36] That's what Yvonne did with me.
[11036.74 → 11037.44] Oh, what'd she do?
[11037.98 → 11038.78] Interview then tour.
[11039.32 → 11039.54] Oh.
[11040.66 → 11041.06] Typical.
[11041.48 → 11042.52] She's so good at it.
[11044.12 → 11044.78] That's sick.
[11044.94 → 11045.20] Yeah.
[11045.52 → 11046.18] I don't know if that's
[11046.18 → 11046.66] for everybody.
[11047.60 → 11048.12] Let's see.
[11048.20 → 11048.88] I'm in the process
[11048.88 → 11050.16] of building my first house
[11050.16 → 11050.92] and I'm thinking about
[11050.92 → 11052.44] doing the painting myself
[11052.44 → 11053.20] to save money.
[11053.20 → 11054.20] I'm currently looking
[11054.20 → 11055.70] for looking at spraying.
[11055.88 → 11056.90] Would that be worth it
[11056.90 → 11057.96] and what should I look out for?
[11058.42 → 11058.70] Spraying.
[11058.76 → 11060.38] What is your sanity worth to you?
[11061.70 → 11062.86] Painting's a lot of work
[11062.86 → 11064.10] and it's tedious.
[11065.20 → 11066.84] I think what you should do
[11066.84 → 11069.78] is, man,
[11069.88 → 11070.44] you're in the process
[11070.44 → 11071.34] of building your own house.
[11071.46 → 11072.84] Man, you got so much to do.
[11072.92 → 11073.08] Okay.
[11074.08 → 11074.68] So it depends.
[11074.92 → 11076.14] If this is new construction,
[11076.86 → 11078.56] spraying can be very efficient
[11078.56 → 11081.26] and can be pretty cost-effective.
[11081.26 → 11084.10] If everything else is in place,
[11084.10 → 11085.78] you probably don't want to spray.
[11085.92 → 11086.98] The amount of work
[11086.98 → 11089.54] that you save by spraying
[11089.54 → 11090.94] instead of rolling,
[11091.24 → 11092.58] it's going to cost you
[11092.58 → 11094.00] in masking everything off
[11094.00 → 11095.10] and protecting everything else
[11095.10 → 11095.86] from overspray.
[11097.14 → 11099.30] I would say painting
[11099.30 → 11100.06] is the kind of thing
[11100.06 → 11100.74] that some people,
[11100.86 → 11102.02] even very handy people,
[11102.40 → 11104.42] just don't have patience for
[11104.42 → 11107.20] and it's worth painting one room
[11107.20 → 11109.50] because presumably you can do that.
[11109.90 → 11110.52] Painting one room
[11110.52 → 11111.10] to see if you have
[11111.10 → 11112.10] the temperament for it
[11112.10 → 11113.68] and if you don't,
[11113.70 → 11115.16] just have a professional
[11115.16 → 11116.16] come in and do it.
[11116.22 → 11116.86] They'll come in,
[11117.24 → 11118.92] they'll rip through the job,
[11119.40 → 11120.86] especially if it's new construction.
[11121.04 → 11121.60] They really know
[11121.60 → 11122.38] what they're doing there
[11122.38 → 11124.16] and then it's just done.
[11128.36 → 11129.22] Hey, DLL.
[11129.68 → 11130.48] Oh, wait, sorry.
[11130.58 → 11131.62] Ask for what to look out for.
[11132.00 → 11132.86] Don't waste money
[11132.86 → 11136.56] on just extra crap
[11136.56 → 11137.74] that you don't need.
[11137.92 → 11139.04] You do not need
[11139.04 → 11140.94] a special little bucket
[11140.94 → 11142.36] for holding your paint
[11142.36 → 11143.34] when you go up the ladder.
[11143.56 → 11146.02] You just use a paint bucket.
[11146.44 → 11148.52] You fold over the handle.
[11148.74 → 11149.76] You hold that in your thumb.
[11149.90 → 11150.40] You hold the bottom
[11150.40 → 11151.08] of the paint bucket
[11151.08 → 11152.52] and you just fill it up
[11152.52 → 11153.36] about this much.
[11153.42 → 11154.22] It's called a cut can.
[11154.68 → 11155.92] Not because you cut the can,
[11156.00 → 11157.54] but it's for cutting in the edges.
[11158.18 → 11159.16] So you just put like
[11159.16 → 11160.14] this much paint in the bottom
[11160.14 → 11161.20] and you dip your brush,
[11161.64 → 11162.64] bang it on the sides
[11162.64 → 11164.54] and just paint a nice steady line.
[11164.62 → 11165.88] Just use like a sash.
[11166.36 → 11167.74] I think it's called a sash brush,
[11167.88 → 11170.88] the kind that's shaped like that.
[11171.16 → 11172.30] Okay, like kind of like a sword.
[11173.70 → 11176.14] So don't waste money on like,
[11176.52 → 11177.38] you know, oh yeah,
[11177.56 → 11178.42] buy this little thing
[11178.42 → 11179.90] that goes on the end of a pole
[11179.90 → 11180.66] and you know,
[11180.74 → 11182.04] you like to run it along the top
[11182.04 → 11182.54] to do edging.
[11182.62 → 11183.76] Don't do any of that stuff.
[11183.86 → 11184.70] The only things you need
[11184.70 → 11185.34] to paint a room
[11185.34 → 11186.20] are brush, a roller,
[11186.32 → 11187.14] pull a roller,
[11187.54 → 11188.64] a cut can
[11188.64 → 11189.84] and a drop cloth.
[11190.46 → 11191.90] Never, ever.
[11192.04 → 11193.72] No job is so small
[11193.72 → 11194.78] that you don't need a drop cloth.
[11196.08 → 11196.84] Don't do it.
[11196.92 → 11197.54] It's not worth it.
[11197.56 → 11198.64] I've heard this from other people as well,
[11198.90 → 11200.22] specifically about the drop cloth.
[11201.80 → 11202.28] Hey, DLL,
[11202.58 → 11204.94] I might try to skunk works
[11204.94 → 11206.40] a LAN at Open Sauce.
[11206.88 → 11208.46] What's your most obscure
[11208.46 → 11209.38] LAN party favourite
[11209.38 → 11210.32] that you've had issues
[11210.32 → 11211.84] running on modern systems?
[11212.00 → 11212.36] Libero.
[11213.34 → 11213.60] Ooh.
[11214.14 → 11214.96] But there is a
[11215.02 → 11216.98] there's a modern like redo,
[11216.98 → 11217.86] but it doesn't include
[11217.86 → 11218.92] some of my favourite things
[11218.92 → 11219.82] to do in old Libero.
[11219.94 → 11220.68] It had a map editor
[11220.68 → 11221.58] that was a lot of fun.
[11221.68 → 11221.82] We,
[11221.88 → 11224.28] we spent a lot of time
[11224.28 → 11225.86] in Mr. McCloskey's portable.
[11226.04 → 11226.72] What is Libero?
[11227.20 → 11228.36] It's a little like,
[11228.40 → 11228.98] it's like worms,
[11229.10 → 11229.82] but real time.
[11230.52 → 11231.16] One V one.
[11231.32 → 11231.68] Oh.
[11232.28 → 11232.52] Yeah.
[11232.52 → 11233.24] It's like,
[11233.58 → 11234.32] it's ancient.
[11234.44 → 11235.28] How do you spell it?
[11235.50 → 11236.54] L I E R O.
[11236.54 → 11239.42] Whoa.
[11239.70 → 11240.94] It is definitely ancient.
[11241.08 → 11241.58] It's super fun.
[11242.26 → 11242.84] That's sweet.
[11243.80 → 11244.04] DLL,
[11244.32 → 11246.36] I have been Amazon free
[11246.36 → 11247.04] for a year
[11247.04 → 11248.44] after listening to Luke.
[11248.78 → 11249.22] Recently,
[11249.22 → 11251.64] I had two tech orders
[11251.64 → 11253.20] placed at other stores
[11253.20 → 11254.76] ship from Amazon.
[11254.92 → 11255.20] Got them.
[11255.32 → 11256.28] How do you avoid this?
[11256.38 → 11256.88] Should company
[11256.88 → 11258.16] have to disclose this?
[11259.20 → 11259.44] Yeah.
[11259.90 → 11261.00] F***ING got them.
[11261.20 → 11261.76] What?
[11261.76 → 11262.16] Okay.
[11262.26 → 11263.52] I've received boxes
[11263.52 → 11267.18] that were Amazon boxes
[11267.18 → 11268.90] from other companies,
[11269.00 → 11269.96] but I don't think,
[11270.22 → 11272.46] I don't think they're just
[11272.46 → 11273.74] relabelled it personally.
[11274.16 → 11275.84] I think they just had that box
[11275.84 → 11277.26] and reused it.
[11277.44 → 11277.84] Um,
[11278.26 → 11280.62] wow.
[11280.66 → 11281.90] I don't run into this very often.
[11282.32 → 11284.30] Just try to find another store.
[11284.42 → 11285.22] I don't think there's like,
[11285.24 → 11286.08] you're not going to be able to
[11286.08 → 11287.54] go back to them and be like,
[11287.54 → 11289.14] I didn't want this to come from Amazon.
[11289.74 → 11290.18] Um,
[11290.68 → 11291.24] but yeah,
[11291.24 → 11291.56] just,
[11291.66 → 11291.74] uh,
[11291.76 → 11293.06] just go somewhere else.
[11293.60 → 11294.36] There's so much you can do.
[11294.44 → 11294.54] Yeah.
[11294.56 → 11295.14] Best advice.
[11295.32 → 11295.76] Get rest.
[11297.12 → 11297.48] Yeah.
[11297.66 → 11298.04] Good one,
[11298.10 → 11298.20] Luke.
[11299.40 → 11299.84] Uh,
[11300.00 → 11300.52] oh my God.
[11300.56 → 11300.70] They,
[11300.74 → 11302.04] they said the names properly.
[11302.20 → 11302.40] Hello,
[11302.46 → 11302.68] Dan,
[11302.76 → 11303.56] Luke and Linus.
[11303.60 → 11304.46] This feels wrong now.
[11304.76 → 11305.12] Uh,
[11305.12 → 11306.54] any update on whale land
[11306.54 → 11308.06] and what are you looking forward
[11308.06 → 11309.20] to seeing at Computer
[11309.20 → 11310.52] from M Barton,
[11310.60 → 11310.98] the whale?
[11311.12 → 11312.22] I'm kind of hoping for
[11312.22 → 11313.54] Nvidia 5000 series
[11313.54 → 11314.08] at Computer.
[11314.12 → 11314.78] That'd be pretty cool.
[11314.78 → 11315.56] I don't actually think
[11315.56 → 11316.18] it's that likely,
[11316.32 → 11316.64] but I'd,
[11316.64 → 11317.72] I'd certainly be into it.
[11317.94 → 11319.10] Could use a new,
[11319.34 → 11319.60] you know,
[11319.68 → 11320.46] GPU family.
[11320.60 → 11321.70] Maybe the pricing won't suck.
[11321.70 → 11322.30] Sorry.
[11324.30 → 11325.18] It's not funny.
[11325.98 → 11326.38] Um,
[11326.48 → 11328.20] update on whale land.
[11328.30 → 11328.50] No,
[11328.66 → 11329.84] we've got to work things out
[11329.84 → 11330.32] with the city.
[11330.32 → 11331.22] That's probably going to take
[11331.22 → 11331.78] some time.
[11331.94 → 11333.00] We'll see how it goes.
[11333.08 → 11334.10] Hopefully they are,
[11334.10 → 11335.12] um,
[11335.50 → 11336.52] willing to work with us
[11336.52 → 11337.18] in good faith.
[11337.18 → 11337.98] And if not,
[11338.10 → 11338.40] then,
[11338.40 → 11338.90] I mean,
[11339.00 → 11339.60] it might be dead.
[11340.34 → 11340.70] So,
[11340.80 → 11341.18] uh,
[11341.70 → 11342.56] yeah,
[11342.60 → 11343.52] that would sure be
[11343.52 → 11344.50] lame.
[11345.64 → 11346.36] Lame land.
[11346.62 → 11346.96] Yeah.
[11347.56 → 11348.26] Lame land.
[11348.70 → 11349.28] It's all mine.
[11351.78 → 11352.46] All right.
[11352.58 → 11353.52] And on that note,
[11353.64 → 11353.86] Hey,
[11353.92 → 11355.10] thanks so much for tuning in.
[11355.20 → 11356.50] We will see you again next week.
[11356.58 → 11357.24] Same bad time.
[11357.32 → 11358.18] Are we going to skim through potentials?
[11359.76 → 11360.60] Same bad channel?
[11360.80 → 11361.02] Oh,
[11361.50 → 11362.58] I do need to skip through quick,
[11362.66 → 11363.92] but there are a bunch of potentials.
[11363.92 → 11364.12] I,
[11364.54 → 11365.78] those were collapsed by default.
[11365.88 → 11366.70] I didn't even see them.
[11366.92 → 11367.08] Oh,
[11367.86 → 11368.40] I'll start top.
[11368.46 → 11368.88] You start bottom.
[11369.00 → 11369.32] Uh,
[11369.50 → 11369.92] I mean,
[11369.96 → 11370.34] sure.
[11371.50 → 11371.76] Linus,
[11371.80 → 11373.70] would you consider daily driving a Sony smartphone?
[11374.26 → 11374.66] Absolutely.
[11375.24 → 11381.40] The one thing I'm waiting for is for them to allow reversing the back and multitask buttons.
[11381.96 → 11382.36] Um,
[11382.42 → 11382.80] I,
[11382.92 → 11383.82] I am right-handed.
[11384.00 → 11388.04] I use back a lot and I usually use my phone in my right hand.
[11388.12 → 11390.46] I cannot be reaching across it like that.
[11390.46 → 11390.92] So I just,
[11391.02 → 11393.54] I just need them to get that done, and then I'm good to go.
[11393.54 → 11393.76] I'm,
[11393.76 → 11394.50] I'm so ready.
[11399.62 → 11400.64] I'm trying to curate.
[11400.86 → 11401.02] Oh,
[11401.36 → 11401.70] okay.
[11401.98 → 11402.78] William asks,
[11402.96 → 11403.50] uh,
[11403.50 → 11406.32] we've heard about the charges that app stores charge,
[11406.44 → 11409.84] but how much did a store like NCI make off of a $60 game?
[11409.96 → 11411.54] So NCI had very,
[11412.34 → 11417.40] very poor relationships with game publishers and game distributors.
[11417.62 → 11418.18] Uh,
[11418.18 → 11421.40] so we would make as little,
[11421.68 → 11421.70] uh,
[11421.70 → 11422.64] we,
[11422.72 → 11430.84] we could make as much as about three or $4 off of a $60 game and as little as losing money in order to hit MSRP.
[11430.84 → 11432.98] It was very stupid.
[11433.12 → 11439.14] Basically physical media sales was a complete disaster from us from day zero until the very end.
[11439.66 → 11442.24] It just made absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[11442.46 → 11444.38] There was also like barely any there.
[11444.66 → 11444.80] It was,
[11445.06 → 11445.34] yeah,
[11445.34 → 11445.56] well,
[11445.56 → 11447.14] if we didn't make any money on them.
[11447.24 → 11447.44] Yeah.
[11447.90 → 11448.96] Why would we stock them?
[11449.44 → 11455.96] Occasionally we'd bring in some like a really hot new title just to kind of bring people in the door and have them be aware that we existed.
[11456.16 → 11459.20] But that was the only business reason that we would ever do that.
[11459.20 → 11461.94] I'm just going to take a screenshot here.
[11462.04 → 11463.68] This isn't freezing.
[11463.88 → 11464.74] If you think that's happening.
[11465.28 → 11465.54] Okay,
[11465.62 → 11465.88] cool.
[11467.50 → 11467.90] Uh,
[11467.98 → 11468.54] do continue.
[11469.22 → 11470.22] If you have any more.
[11470.22 → 11472.22] Oh,
[11472.82 → 11474.10] do you want me to just like do stuff?
[11474.42 → 11474.74] Uh,
[11474.76 → 11474.96] okay.
[11475.04 → 11475.16] No,
[11475.22 → 11475.48] I'm done.
[11475.54 → 11475.98] I can be down.
[11476.52 → 11476.80] Sorry.
[11477.06 → 11477.38] Uh,
[11477.46 → 11477.62] Hey,
[11477.70 → 11478.02] LLD,
[11478.16 → 11480.48] I've been really enjoying David as a host recently.
[11480.66 → 11482.44] What went into his move from shooting to hosting?
[11482.76 → 11486.24] Was it something he initiated or was it suggested by someone else at the company?
[11486.46 → 11486.66] Oh,
[11486.68 → 11486.88] I mean,
[11486.88 → 11489.38] I think that would be a story for David to tell,
[11489.54 → 11489.78] but,
[11489.90 → 11490.26] um,
[11491.48 → 11492.36] I thought that might be the case.
[11492.44 → 11492.60] I just,
[11492.70 → 11492.90] yeah,
[11493.08 → 11496.34] I guess I can kind of tell maybe my part of it.
[11496.48 → 11496.84] I,
[11496.96 → 11497.12] uh,
[11497.12 → 11499.86] I've always really enjoyed working with David.
[11499.86 → 11502.38] And I think that from,
[11502.38 → 11502.80] you know,
[11502.84 → 11504.02] my point of view,
[11504.02 → 11504.90] um,
[11505.72 → 11506.44] it was,
[11506.60 → 11507.04] it was,
[11507.04 → 11507.38] uh,
[11508.04 → 11511.68] a cool potential path for him to,
[11511.68 → 11512.76] to progression.
[11513.04 → 11516.62] I think that he'd been in that role for a really long time.
[11516.62 → 11517.66] And I think that,
[11517.76 → 11518.20] uh,
[11518.90 → 11520.24] I think it's been really,
[11520.34 → 11520.94] really positive.
[11520.94 → 11521.42] Uh,
[11521.42 → 11521.84] we've always,
[11521.92 → 11522.72] I really like his stuff.
[11523.04 → 11523.20] I,
[11523.38 → 11523.62] I,
[11523.74 → 11524.60] I see,
[11524.66 → 11527.14] I have to be careful when I'm putting words in other people's mouths.
[11527.14 → 11527.44] Right.
[11527.46 → 11528.44] Because I was about to say,
[11528.44 → 11529.92] we've always enjoyed working together,
[11529.92 → 11530.72] but for all I know,
[11530.76 → 11532.04] he hates my guts,
[11532.10 → 11532.30] right?
[11533.04 → 11533.44] Who knows?
[11533.82 → 11534.16] I mean,
[11534.18 → 11536.54] I don't know that he'd still be here if that were the case.
[11536.58 → 11537.70] He's been here a long time now.
[11538.20 → 11538.74] Is he,
[11538.84 → 11539.04] is he at his,
[11539.32 → 11540.18] I mean,
[11540.24 → 11541.86] I can't get into people's start dates.
[11542.62 → 11543.92] You have to be so careful,
[11544.32 → 11544.56] right?
[11544.62 → 11546.00] About as an employer,
[11546.32 → 11547.90] disclosing people's information.
[11547.90 → 11551.94] I think I'm pretty sure that everything I'm saying right now is within bounds,
[11551.94 → 11552.52] but you have to,
[11552.64 → 11553.16] you just,
[11553.26 → 11554.36] you have to be so careful anyway.
[11554.36 → 11557.40] I always really enjoyed working with him and I thought it would be,
[11557.82 → 11558.04] uh,
[11558.04 → 11561.08] be pretty cool to work on more of like the planning,
[11561.24 → 11562.46] the video side together,
[11562.46 → 11564.76] as opposed to the execution of the video side together.
[11564.76 → 11574.94] And we've got some quite senior members of the camera team that are really awesome to the point where we didn't need David to be there all day,
[11574.94 → 11575.90] every day anymore.
[11575.90 → 11576.50] Um,
[11576.70 → 11580.92] we've got Andy and second Andy and Andrew.
[11581.18 → 11582.20] He goes by Andrew.
[11582.36 → 11582.86] I was just,
[11582.94 → 11586.42] I was so tickled when he came back from a family function of some sort.
[11586.52 → 11587.32] And he was like,
[11587.36 → 11587.52] yeah,
[11587.56 → 11587.96] I kept,
[11588.36 → 11588.50] uh,
[11588.50 → 11589.06] people kept,
[11589.06 → 11589.42] uh,
[11589.42 → 11590.48] talking to me, and I'd go,
[11590.56 → 11590.64] Oh,
[11590.66 → 11591.04] where's Andy?
[11591.24 → 11591.74] Because he,
[11591.86 → 11595.90] he gets called Andy, and it never even occurred to me because it goes by Andrew here.
[11595.90 → 11600.62] And also because we have Andy and Andrew in the camera department.
[11600.62 → 11603.60] So nobody would ever think to call Andrew Andy,
[11603.60 → 11604.12] but it's like,
[11604.14 → 11604.26] yeah,
[11604.28 → 11605.42] obviously it's short for,
[11605.86 → 11606.04] um,
[11606.04 → 11606.56] and then Glenn,
[11606.78 → 11608.06] Glenn's been doing awesome work,
[11608.30 → 11608.74] um,
[11609.40 → 11610.94] with the camera team lately as well.
[11610.94 → 11611.50] So we,
[11611.60 → 11611.74] yeah,
[11611.74 → 11614.36] we've got like three perfect dedicated camerae,
[11614.56 → 11615.98] camera people and some,
[11616.14 → 11618.54] and some others that can kind of sub in when needed.
[11618.54 → 11619.12] So yeah,
[11619.12 → 11620.10] David moved over to writing.
[11620.16 → 11621.74] I think he's been doing a great job.
[11621.76 → 11624.24] He's got a very creative mind,
[11625.24 → 11625.62] very,
[11625.74 → 11626.68] very creative mind.
[11626.74 → 11627.08] He loves,
[11627.20 → 11627.46] he's a
[11627.46 → 11628.14] he's a doer.
[11628.20 → 11628.78] He's a
[11628.78 → 11630.04] he's a thinker.
[11630.14 → 11630.56] We've got,
[11630.64 → 11631.00] we've got,
[11631.20 → 11631.52] I mean,
[11631.52 → 11633.52] obviously the only reason I'm talking about David is that you,
[11633.60 → 11633.88] asked,
[11633.96 → 11634.20] uh,
[11634.20 → 11634.86] we've got a really,
[11635.00 → 11636.86] really great team overall world-class,
[11636.98 → 11641.74] but that was specifically in my version of the story,
[11641.92 → 11643.30] not putting any words in his mouth,
[11643.38 → 11643.76] why,
[11643.92 → 11644.10] uh,
[11644.10 → 11645.80] that particular transition took place.
[11647.08 → 11647.90] Hey DLL,
[11648.12 → 11650.42] loved the Afield CT scanner video,
[11650.62 → 11655.70] was wondering what you think about heat reactive cups that show the internals of various products when it heats up.
[11656.58 → 11659.02] That's a superb cool idea.
[11659.10 → 11659.54] Pretty neat.
[11659.54 → 11660.04] Uh,
[11660.04 → 11665.98] finding a mug source that doesn't have any lead in their shit has been very difficult.
[11666.26 → 11669.92] If you've ever wondered why we're the only merch store on earth.
[11669.96 → 11670.16] What?
[11670.38 → 11671.72] That doesn't have mugs.
[11672.36 → 11673.20] That's a thing?
[11673.32 → 11674.76] It's not for lack of effort,
[11674.76 → 11676.72] but it's in a lot of the
[11676.78 → 11677.68] it's in a lot of the
[11677.68 → 11678.14] um,
[11678.50 → 11680.20] the like ceramic colourant,
[11680.36 → 11680.96] like the treatment.
[11681.24 → 11681.52] Yeah.
[11681.52 → 11682.28] I was,
[11682.38 → 11683.26] it's probably fine.
[11683.52 → 11683.82] Current,
[11683.94 → 11689.64] current amount of years old when I figured out that crystal is lead crystal.
[11689.92 → 11690.14] Yeah.
[11690.32 → 11692.28] Like old crystal cookware,
[11692.46 → 11693.30] whatever was all,
[11693.40 → 11694.00] it's all lead.
[11694.46 → 11695.26] I have no idea.
[11695.44 → 11697.98] I don't think a lot of it actually leaches into whatever's in it,
[11698.06 → 11698.50] but like,
[11698.58 → 11698.78] sure,
[11698.88 → 11699.20] you know,
[11699.72 → 11700.78] yeah.
[11701.24 → 11701.52] Yeah.
[11701.52 → 11701.88] So,
[11701.96 → 11702.36] um,
[11702.44 → 11704.94] at some point we're going to figure it out.
[11705.84 → 11706.32] Maybe.
[11706.32 → 11709.48] I also was deeply uncomfortable with,
[11709.48 → 11709.94] um,
[11710.22 → 11711.50] how bone China works.
[11711.84 → 11716.12] So only a certain percentage of what they fire,
[11716.12 → 11716.64] uh,
[11716.64 → 11717.40] meets the
[11717.40 → 11717.66] the
[11717.70 → 11718.66] the quality standard,
[11718.84 → 11719.46] which,
[11719.60 → 11719.96] you know,
[11719.98 → 11720.90] is inherent,
[11721.02 → 11721.46] I guess.
[11722.08 → 11722.56] Um,
[11723.28 → 11727.48] but the solution to that is that anything that doesn't meet standard,
[11727.48 → 11733.02] they have specially mapped out landfills where it just all goes.
[11735.66 → 11736.18] Okay.
[11736.68 → 11744.22] Any industry that has so much waste that they have their own special landfill where they can put all of their stuff.
[11744.22 → 11746.48] I thought it had something to do with how it was mapped out.
[11746.58 → 11747.08] I was confused.
[11747.20 → 11747.72] All right.
[11747.84 → 11748.00] Yeah.
[11748.08 → 11748.28] No,
[11748.38 → 11748.52] no,
[11748.54 → 11748.82] it's just,
[11748.90 → 11750.26] there's a ton of waste.
[11750.54 → 11750.98] Yeah.
[11751.14 → 11754.18] So much for every mug that we sold on the store,
[11754.20 → 11758.14] they were going to produce like three to meet our quality standards.
[11758.42 → 11759.56] So we were just like,
[11759.62 → 11761.76] how about no?
[11762.50 → 11762.84] Yeah.
[11763.14 → 11763.34] Yeah.
[11763.34 → 11764.10] How about not that?
[11764.30 → 11764.66] All right.
[11764.72 → 11765.48] So that's pretty cool.
[11765.48 → 11766.86] Hey,
[11766.98 → 11767.52] WAN.DLL,
[11767.68 → 11769.68] what are your daily driver battery banks?
[11769.80 → 11770.78] And hold on to be clear,
[11770.92 → 11771.48] to be clear,
[11771.64 → 11774.50] there might be suppliers that do a better job or whatever,
[11774.50 → 11775.64] but we haven't found them.
[11775.64 → 11776.60] So we're,
[11776.84 → 11777.18] so we're,
[11777.26 → 11777.60] and yeah,
[11777.80 → 11778.30] there you go.
[11778.30 → 11781.50] what's your daily driver battery bank.
[11781.50 → 11783.78] I remember you mentioning one.
[11783.78 → 11791.98] it's a
[11791.98 → 11792.82] hold on.
[11792.82 → 11793.64] I'm going to get the
[11793.80 → 11802.24] anchor 733 power banks.
[11802.24 → 11808.76] so it's a combination wall wart slash power bank with PD.
[11808.76 → 11809.76] Um,
[11809.76 → 11810.76] it's kind of inconvenient.
[11810.76 → 11812.34] It's kind of inconvenient how heavy it is.
[11812.50 → 11812.98] So,
[11813.08 → 11817.76] especially when I'm travelling on like loose hotel and plane outlets,
[11818.58 → 11819.52] it has a tendency.
[11819.52 → 11820.30] It'll fall out.
[11820.36 → 11820.54] Yeah.
[11820.64 → 11821.54] I feel how heavy it is.
[11822.16 → 11822.54] Yeah.
[11822.54 → 11823.24] I can see that happening.
[11823.24 → 11824.66] It has a tendency to fall out,
[11824.78 → 11825.16] but,
[11825.30 → 11825.70] um,
[11826.04 → 11832.04] the convenience of having a battery bank that is always charged because I use it
[11832.04 → 11835.62] anytime I charge my laptop, and it charges this at the same time.
[11835.62 → 11836.70] That's actually pretty cool.
[11836.76 → 11837.78] Kind of outweighs it.
[11838.02 → 11838.30] Um,
[11839.06 → 11841.42] yeah,
[11841.74 → 11842.30] I mean,
[11842.30 → 11842.52] look,
[11842.56 → 11842.90] I've,
[11842.90 → 11843.82] I've talked about this before.
[11843.82 → 11845.94] We won't take anchors money because I,
[11846.20 → 11848.54] I don't think they've ever really made right,
[11849.06 → 11849.50] um,
[11849.60 → 11850.70] from that whole,
[11850.70 → 11852.48] that whole security camera,
[11852.48 → 11854.52] an Dufy brand situation thing.
[11854.78 → 11855.14] Um,
[11855.14 → 11857.26] but that doesn't mean I won't use the product.
[11857.66 → 11858.58] Like people seem,
[11858.76 → 11862.06] people seem to be very sometimes confused about the things that I say.
[11862.16 → 11863.82] There's a difference between company and self.
[11864.48 → 11865.42] There's also a difference.
[11865.42 → 11868.76] People find this to be a very difficult concept when it comes to me and Amazon
[11868.76 → 11871.82] because they know that float plane has some workings through AWS.
[11872.64 → 11873.40] And they're like,
[11873.44 → 11874.78] you boycott Amazon,
[11874.98 → 11877.42] but you used AWS stuff with float plane.
[11877.46 → 11877.66] I'm like,
[11877.70 → 11877.90] yeah.
[11878.72 → 11881.70] You criticize society, yet you participate in society.
[11881.70 → 11882.10] It's like,
[11882.18 → 11882.36] well,
[11882.44 → 11882.66] I,
[11882.74 → 11883.00] I,
[11883.00 → 11883.46] I,
[11883.46 → 11883.56] I,
[11883.56 → 11883.74] I,
[11883.74 → 11883.76] I,
[11883.76 → 11883.80] I,
[11883.80 → 11883.82] I,
[11883.82 → 11883.84] I,
[11883.84 → 11883.86] I,
[11883.86 → 11883.90] I,
[11883.90 → 11884.40] I,
[11884.40 → 11884.90] I,
[11884.90 → 11885.50] I,
[11885.50 → 11885.58] I,
[11885.58 → 11885.60] I,
[11885.60 → 11885.62] I,
[11885.62 → 11885.70] I,
[11885.70 → 11885.96] I,
[11885.96 → 11886.44] I,
[11886.44 → 11886.54] I,
[11886.54 → 11887.52] I,
[11887.52 → 11887.62] I,
[11887.62 → 11887.70] I,
[11887.70 → 11888.06] I,
[11888.06 → 11888.52] I,
[11888.52 → 11888.54] I,
[11888.54 → 11888.56] I,
[11888.56 → 11888.62] I,
[11888.62 → 11889.08] I,
[11889.08 → 11890.02] I,
[11890.02 → 11890.32] I,
[11890.32 → 11890.38] I,
[11890.38 → 11890.40] I,
[11890.40 → 11890.54] I'm,
[11890.54 → 11890.56] I'm,
[11890.56 → 11893.44] I'm willing to buy a product and use it or in that,
[11893.44 → 11893.94] in that case,
[11894.02 → 11895.36] probably they sent it to us as a sample.
[11895.48 → 11895.74] I don't know,
[11895.96 → 11897.62] but I'm willing to use a product.
[11897.62 → 11904.52] I'm not willing to endorse it, and I'm not willing to take their money in order to promote it to you.
[11904.78 → 11905.04] Yeah.
[11905.14 → 11905.48] That's it.
[11905.60 → 11906.04] It's that simple.
[11910.64 → 11911.58] For Linus,
[11911.62 → 11913.34] are you still using your Steam Deck?
[11913.40 → 11913.60] No.
[11913.60 → 11917.08] I did just finally finish Day of the Diver though.
[11917.68 → 11918.22] It was awesome.
[11918.42 → 11919.12] I played it on the L.A.
[11919.20 → 11919.50] Nice.
[11919.64 → 11919.80] Yeah,
[11919.80 → 11920.20] it's a good game.
[11920.26 → 11920.46] Did you,
[11920.54 → 11921.00] did you play it?
[11921.84 → 11923.26] I started it.
[11923.46 → 11926.04] I didn't get super gripped and with that type of gameplay time,
[11926.08 → 11928.14] I should be spending more time in Final Fantasy VI,
[11928.20 → 11929.06] so I have not continued.
[11929.06 → 11929.32] Oh yeah,
[11929.34 → 11930.12] have you played it at all?
[11930.20 → 11930.72] A little bit.
[11930.90 → 11931.12] Oh,
[11931.20 → 11931.40] really?
[11931.54 → 11932.10] Just not a lot.
[11932.28 → 11932.62] Where are you at?
[11932.76 → 11934.14] I'm still stuck in that town.
[11934.24 → 11934.86] I don't remember the name of it.
[11934.90 → 11935.10] Wow,
[11935.14 → 11935.50] you suck.
[11935.66 → 11935.84] Yeah.
[11935.96 → 11936.82] He's still in Zoo.
[11937.14 → 11937.36] Yeah.
[11937.76 → 11939.78] You might say that his effort has been Zoo.
[11940.22 → 11940.48] Yeah.
[11943.60 → 11945.74] You get a bell for that one.
[11946.28 → 11946.64] LLD,
[11946.96 → 11948.92] have you ever met a person who you thought was a fan,
[11949.02 → 11951.96] but they were actually some acquaintance you just forgot you met?
[11952.04 → 11952.28] Oh yeah.
[11952.92 → 11953.32] 100%.
[11953.32 → 11954.40] 100%.
[11954.40 → 11955.72] That's insane.
[11955.72 → 11956.54] Especially at trade shows.
[11956.98 → 11957.30] Oh.
[11957.56 → 11957.92] Because man,
[11957.98 → 11960.76] there'll be someone I haven't seen in eight years or whatever,
[11961.26 → 11965.10] and they remember me because they watch the videos or something,
[11965.44 → 11969.10] so their memory of me is constantly being refreshed,
[11969.92 → 11971.08] and mine isn't,
[11971.14 → 11971.88] and no offence,
[11971.88 → 11974.56] but like I'm terrible with names and faces,
[11974.56 → 11975.26] and I,
[11975.70 → 11979.14] even going back to my days at NCI when I had no YouTube channel at all,
[11979.62 → 11984.12] I would be meeting so many people because I was a retailer,
[11984.12 → 11985.34] and generally like,
[11985.52 → 11985.66] you know,
[11985.70 → 11987.42] everyone's trying to get their product in your store,
[11987.50 → 11992.16] so I would have so many people wanting to meet me that there are so many faces,
[11992.32 → 11993.36] and I'm so sleep-deprived,
[11993.52 → 11993.94] like I just,
[11994.06 → 11996.44] I'm at my worst at trade shows.
[11996.50 → 11997.36] I try my best,
[11997.46 → 11998.58] but I'm at my worst,
[11998.58 → 12002.98] and so I just often have this issue.
[12003.50 → 12003.96] I will,
[12004.04 → 12007.24] I will sometimes start an encounter with someone,
[12007.36 → 12009.38] and I'll just gamble because I have no idea.
[12009.62 → 12009.72] Yeah.
[12009.72 → 12010.16] I'll be like,
[12010.26 → 12010.38] hey,
[12010.42 → 12011.20] nice to see you again,
[12011.20 → 12011.58] and they're like,
[12011.64 → 12011.82] what?
[12012.34 → 12013.20] Or I'll be like,
[12013.42 → 12013.54] hey,
[12013.60 → 12014.20] nice to meet you,
[12014.20 → 12014.68] and they're like,
[12015.48 → 12015.88] this is,
[12016.00 → 12017.60] this is about the fourth time,
[12017.70 → 12018.02] but sure.
[12018.10 → 12018.98] You have to do the neutrals.
[12020.14 → 12020.38] No,
[12020.38 → 12021.92] I just own it at this point.
[12022.04 → 12022.56] Good to see you.
[12024.06 → 12024.60] First time?
[12024.72 → 12025.12] Last time?
[12025.18 → 12025.48] Who knows?
[12025.88 → 12026.12] No,
[12026.26 → 12026.72] I just,
[12026.80 → 12027.06] no,
[12027.16 → 12027.44] I just,
[12027.48 → 12028.18] I just own it at this point.
[12028.18 → 12029.36] I do neutrals for sure,
[12029.48 → 12030.78] even if I'm 100% confident,
[12030.86 → 12031.40] I just do neutrals.
[12031.54 → 12032.40] If I get it wrong,
[12032.50 → 12033.06] I'm just like,
[12033.14 → 12033.32] yeah,
[12033.34 → 12033.74] I'm sorry,
[12033.80 → 12034.94] I'm terrible with names and faces.
[12036.06 → 12037.36] I think it's a learning disability.
[12037.42 → 12038.54] One of my problems is actually,
[12038.54 → 12039.02] they can't,
[12039.02 → 12040.86] they can't come after me if I say it's a disability.
[12044.36 → 12044.68] No,
[12044.68 → 12044.96] seriously,
[12045.08 → 12047.80] I can't do it to the point where I think there might be something wrong with me.
[12048.04 → 12049.82] Isn't that part of ADHD stuff?
[12049.82 → 12050.24] I don't know.
[12050.28 → 12050.48] Maybe.
[12050.64 → 12051.16] I thought it was.
[12051.32 → 12051.60] Sure.
[12051.88 → 12052.32] I don't know.
[12052.38 → 12052.52] Well,
[12052.56 → 12053.40] it's a learning disability.
[12053.62 → 12053.88] Sure.
[12055.04 → 12055.72] I don't know.
[12056.58 → 12057.06] For me,
[12057.10 → 12058.16] I constantly think I,
[12058.22 → 12060.54] I like might recognize people.
[12062.34 → 12063.64] So then who knows?
[12064.06 → 12064.22] Yeah.
[12064.22 → 12064.70] I'll be like,
[12064.74 → 12067.30] I might know this person from like hockey when I was.
[12067.30 → 12069.36] It also might've been at like a viewer meetup.
[12069.50 → 12070.00] Or that.
[12070.06 → 12070.58] So who knows?
[12070.70 → 12071.60] Or whatever else.
[12071.68 → 12072.74] It could be any relationship.
[12072.96 → 12073.68] I have no clue.
[12073.74 → 12074.50] And then they'll say hi.
[12074.54 → 12075.00] And I'm like,
[12075.78 → 12076.26] sure.
[12076.52 → 12078.26] Could be generic white dude.
[12078.26 → 12080.36] Could be met at a meetup.
[12080.52 → 12082.38] Could be played sports with.
[12082.40 → 12083.16] I have no clue.
[12085.58 → 12086.02] All right.
[12086.08 → 12086.44] Next up.
[12086.54 → 12087.00] Let's keep going.
[12087.36 → 12087.58] Okay.
[12087.62 → 12088.52] I'm going to go with that.
[12088.56 → 12089.30] I'm just going to say,
[12089.38 → 12089.68] sorry,
[12089.74 → 12090.60] I'm neurodivergent.
[12091.28 → 12091.62] Nice.
[12091.76 → 12092.90] Which is not untrue.
[12093.12 → 12093.72] That is true.
[12094.22 → 12094.78] Let's keep it going.
[12095.60 → 12095.74] Hi,
[12095.78 → 12095.92] Luke.
[12095.98 → 12096.68] Other than NASA,
[12096.68 → 12098.84] what government tech infrastructure would you like to tour?
[12098.92 → 12100.12] Like a nuclear power plant?
[12100.54 → 12100.78] Yeah.
[12100.78 → 12102.18] If we want to see all their floppy disks,
[12102.24 → 12102.60] I guess.
[12104.02 → 12104.50] Anxiety.
[12104.62 → 12104.94] Yes.
[12106.16 → 12107.80] Greetings from WAN team.
[12108.88 → 12109.36] LTT.
[12109.80 → 12111.62] Would like advice from Linus.
[12111.74 → 12117.04] It's been a few months since I bought my manual car, and it's the best purchase decision I've ever made.
[12117.04 → 12118.78] Any tips and tricks for me?
[12118.92 → 12119.32] Have fun.
[12119.42 → 12120.42] Enjoy it while it lasts.
[12120.98 → 12121.38] I mean,
[12121.46 → 12121.76] it's,
[12121.84 → 12126.62] I don't think they're going to keep making them at least not at affordable price points for much longer.
[12127.02 → 12127.26] I mean,
[12127.28 → 12129.10] you'll be able to get older vehicles,
[12129.28 → 12129.78] obviously,
[12129.96 → 12134.08] but replacement parts are eventually going to become difficult to source.
[12134.08 → 12138.88] And the whole manual driving lifestyle is going to fall by the wayside.
[12139.26 → 12139.70] Yeah.
[12139.74 → 12141.44] They have like simulated manual now,
[12141.56 → 12141.72] but.
[12142.24 → 12142.36] Oh,
[12142.42 → 12143.36] the CVT garbage.
[12143.66 → 12144.04] I heard it's awesome.
[12144.34 → 12144.58] Yeah.
[12145.00 → 12146.84] Every article I've read about it is like,
[12146.88 → 12148.68] this is actually f***ING incredible.
[12148.68 → 12151.16] And it's funny because I,
[12151.26 → 12151.38] I,
[12151.54 → 12153.24] every time I come across another one,
[12153.28 → 12155.50] I send it to Alex Clark with like a
[12155.66 → 12160.66] because I told him that I thought that would be something that could like,
[12160.66 → 12169.70] get me really into a car is like having all the torque of electric with like the fun of just playing with the playing with,
[12169.82 → 12170.88] even if it's a fake gearbox,
[12170.88 → 12172.66] like gear by wire or whatever.
[12173.54 → 12174.24] And he,
[12174.48 → 12175.28] every time he's like,
[12175.58 → 12175.98] he's like,
[12176.08 → 12176.50] oh man,
[12176.56 → 12176.76] it's,
[12176.78 → 12177.30] it's hilarious.
[12177.42 → 12178.16] Like seethe harder,
[12178.28 → 12178.50] bro.
[12178.68 → 12180.26] Because he hates it so much.
[12180.36 → 12181.96] He's a mechanical engineering guy,
[12181.96 → 12182.20] right?
[12182.22 → 12182.76] Like he,
[12183.20 → 12185.82] anyway,
[12186.10 → 12187.62] when I get a chance to,
[12187.76 → 12189.44] when we finally get a chance to try one,
[12189.50 → 12193.34] I think we're almost going to have to do two completely separate short circuits.
[12194.82 → 12197.18] He'll have to do one, and I'll have to do one.
[12197.26 → 12197.62] If you,
[12197.62 → 12197.98] if you did,
[12198.14 → 12198.38] yeah.
[12198.60 → 12199.00] Oh,
[12199.24 → 12200.78] or you do one,
[12201.64 → 12202.56] but you have,
[12202.64 → 12206.60] you guys cover the same thing, and you just cover it like back by back or like spliced together.
[12206.76 → 12207.36] Be kind of fun.
[12207.36 → 12208.20] That'd be interesting.
[12208.50 → 12208.68] Yeah.
[12209.62 → 12209.84] Hey,
[12209.86 → 12215.04] DLL early in my IT career as a help desk tech after performing a career change.
[12215.64 → 12219.10] What is a memorable or favourite moment early in your careers?
[12219.10 → 12221.12] I mean,
[12221.32 → 12225.12] my very first day at the computer store being a Boxing Day,
[12225.18 → 12227.54] which is the Canadian equivalent of Black Friday.
[12227.68 → 12227.78] Oh,
[12227.78 → 12228.42] I'm so sorry.
[12228.78 → 12229.72] Absolutely wild.
[12231.18 → 12232.08] That's pretty epic.
[12232.08 → 12232.98] There was,
[12233.06 → 12246.16] there was one day when my supervisor at the time in geek squad told me that I could take my over shirt part of my uniform off so I wouldn't get stopped by employees and could just hide in the back and just work on computers.
[12246.16 → 12249.84] Because we were backed up, and he thought I would be the fastest at fixing everything.
[12249.94 → 12250.36] That's pretty cool.
[12250.36 → 12255.04] And I was so filled with pride that I did as good of a job as I possibly could have.
[12255.10 → 12255.40] Because I was like,
[12255.44 → 12256.06] this is sick.
[12256.98 → 12257.70] That was cool.
[12257.76 → 12258.74] Very early LMG.
[12258.74 → 12263.44] I'll never forget packing for that very first CES putting together that,
[12263.44 → 12268.92] that like duffel that had the editing computer with the extreme edition in it,
[12268.96 → 12269.96] like the super,
[12270.04 → 12271.34] super tiny editing computer.
[12271.70 → 12272.84] And then like,
[12272.86 → 12273.40] it had like a
[12273.52 → 12275.88] like a monitor or two like packed in it.
[12275.92 → 12277.90] I think one of them ended up getting broken at some point.
[12278.00 → 12279.18] Maybe that was at a different trade show.
[12279.22 → 12279.86] It eventually got,
[12279.96 → 12280.74] I think it was eventually,
[12280.74 → 12282.02] but we had these like Acer,
[12282.22 → 12283.94] like super slim for the time,
[12284.00 → 12284.52] uh,
[12284.54 → 12286.02] IPS monitors that were like,
[12286.36 → 12286.74] honestly,
[12286.84 → 12288.72] pieces of like by modern standards.
[12288.74 → 12290.92] But they were good enough that we could edit videos.
[12290.92 → 12291.12] Yeah.
[12291.60 → 12291.96] Um,
[12291.96 → 12295.78] and like this whole clever idea that we were going to set up an editing booth,
[12295.80 → 12296.84] like an editing suite,
[12296.84 → 12298.36] like in our hotel room.
[12298.36 → 12298.94] And like,
[12299.88 → 12300.18] like,
[12300.22 → 12300.36] man,
[12300.38 → 12304.00] we were up late those nights, and we were like filming videos of the prep so that
[12304.00 → 12305.16] we'd have videos to upload.
[12305.18 → 12306.22] Because it was do-or-die time.
[12306.56 → 12307.88] If we didn't make videos,
[12307.88 → 12308.62] like that was it.
[12308.68 → 12311.72] Luke and Ed didn't get paid, and I had to go get a job.
[12311.80 → 12313.66] Like I also didn't get paid.
[12313.78 → 12314.32] It was that simple.
[12314.44 → 12314.54] Yeah.
[12314.54 → 12316.72] We cranked that year was crazy.
[12316.72 → 12320.54] That year was absolutely nuts.
[12320.64 → 12325.18] We're all probably going to live a little bit less long because of that one trip.
[12326.08 → 12326.30] Oh yeah.
[12326.32 → 12327.66] Just a tiny amount.
[12327.72 → 12327.98] Oh yeah.
[12328.08 → 12328.52] A hundred percent.
[12328.62 → 12328.98] But yeah,
[12329.34 → 12329.82] no question.
[12330.82 → 12331.26] Hello,
[12331.36 → 12331.54] Dan,
[12331.64 → 12332.72] Luke and Linus.
[12332.90 → 12333.08] Luke,
[12333.14 → 12337.54] I'm on the opposite side of my health journey from you being underweight and apathetic.
[12337.86 → 12339.58] How would you approach healing in my case?
[12340.26 → 12340.56] Well,
[12340.56 → 12343.62] I have no experience with that really.
[12343.80 → 12344.70] At one point in time,
[12344.70 → 12345.86] I was very,
[12345.98 → 12346.56] very skinny.
[12347.34 → 12347.74] Really?
[12348.18 → 12348.46] Yeah.
[12348.52 → 12350.38] I had like fainting problems from it.
[12350.50 → 12352.38] And do you have any memory of this time?
[12353.08 → 12354.42] It was before I knew you.
[12354.42 → 12356.62] Is the skinny in the room with us right now?
[12356.98 → 12359.12] Is the fetal at this point?
[12359.28 → 12360.04] Oh my goodness.
[12360.24 → 12360.40] No,
[12360.44 → 12360.52] no,
[12360.52 → 12360.62] no.
[12360.62 → 12361.64] This was like in high school.
[12362.42 → 12363.00] If I,
[12363.04 → 12364.50] if I sat down and leaned forward,
[12364.50 → 12365.64] my gut didn't even go out.
[12365.80 → 12366.56] It still came in.
[12366.78 → 12367.76] I was really skinny.
[12367.76 → 12369.98] It was largely because I was growing way too fast.
[12370.06 → 12370.22] Yeah.
[12370.26 → 12371.44] I knew the humblebrag was coming.
[12373.52 → 12374.24] I was just,
[12374.32 → 12375.86] I was just too tall and Chad.
[12376.04 → 12377.48] I didn't say how tall I was at the time.
[12377.52 → 12378.54] I just said it was a growth spurt.
[12378.78 → 12380.46] I was very tall at the time.
[12381.60 → 12383.26] And my cock was growing too.
[12385.12 → 12386.58] It probably was statistically.
[12387.84 → 12388.48] And it's,
[12388.56 → 12389.16] it comes to,
[12389.24 → 12389.50] you know,
[12389.62 → 12391.74] you got to consume more calories if you want to gain more weight.
[12391.74 → 12393.28] And then the apathetic part,
[12393.36 → 12395.96] this isn't going to help with the needing to consume more calories bit,
[12395.96 → 12399.10] but I find to be inspired to do things,
[12399.16 → 12401.00] you have to actually do the thing first.
[12401.14 → 12402.76] You have to be in motion.
[12402.76 → 12403.94] If you want to stay in motion,
[12404.08 → 12404.54] basically,
[12404.54 → 12405.44] um,
[12405.46 → 12406.08] be a flywheel.
[12406.18 → 12406.60] Let's go.
[12406.90 → 12407.06] Yeah.
[12407.10 → 12410.70] So do more stuff and stuff food in your face.
[12410.78 → 12415.62] Try not to just like feed with garbage either though,
[12415.66 → 12416.34] to be clear.
[12416.78 → 12417.84] You don't want a dirty bulk.
[12418.42 → 12419.96] Just eat more food in general.
[12420.82 → 12424.88] One thing that can help with that is eating more dense calories.
[12424.88 → 12426.44] Cause like,
[12426.58 → 12427.54] if you think about the
[12427.66 → 12429.06] how people do it in the
[12429.12 → 12429.66] in the opposite.
[12429.98 → 12430.60] Actually though,
[12430.66 → 12431.64] I know have,
[12431.74 → 12432.52] have more nuts.
[12432.60 → 12435.12] You'll be really surprised at how many calories are in nuts.
[12435.18 → 12439.20] So if you go to like Costco and buy those big tubs of just like nuts.
[12439.34 → 12439.52] Yeah.
[12439.66 → 12442.30] The amount of calories that are in one of those tubs is insane.
[12442.56 → 12442.80] Yep.
[12444.10 → 12445.20] Calories and loose nuts.
[12445.32 → 12445.94] You wouldn't believe it.
[12448.24 → 12449.34] They're trying to eat meals,
[12449.48 → 12450.12] not snacks.
[12450.60 → 12451.00] Okay.
[12451.00 → 12451.90] Last one I got here,
[12452.04 → 12453.14] LTT and NVIDIA.
[12453.32 → 12456.04] Thank you for the 4080 super winning.
[12456.14 → 12458.24] It prompted an emergency case change.
[12458.56 → 12459.20] What was the
[12459.56 → 12463.56] what was one of the most memorable times you acquired something, and it led to
[12463.56 → 12464.58] other purchases?
[12464.82 → 12465.22] You know what?
[12465.22 → 12469.20] I'm going to ignore the second part of your question because the most memorable
[12469.20 → 12474.20] time I ever won something was when my school did like a fundraiser thing where
[12474.20 → 12477.02] you like to sell whatever and like raise money.
[12477.36 → 12480.84] And out of the like 350 students,
[12481.02 → 12486.70] they drew one of those gigantic five pound Hershey chocolate bars as a prize.
[12486.82 → 12488.42] And I fucking won it.
[12488.42 → 12490.90] my dad didn't let me eat it.
[12490.98 → 12494.32] He made me like cut it up into pieces and bring it into my class to share with
[12494.32 → 12494.72] everybody,
[12494.72 → 12497.34] which in hindsight was the right thing.
[12497.66 → 12498.44] Definitely the right.
[12498.88 → 12499.32] Absolutely.
[12499.32 → 12500.98] Like primo parenting moment,
[12501.10 → 12501.78] but fuck.
[12502.10 → 12502.34] Yeah.
[12503.46 → 12504.98] It's not happy about it.
[12507.48 → 12508.50] It's kind of funny.
[12508.86 → 12510.40] What a thing to give to a kid.
[12510.62 → 12510.86] Yeah.
[12511.04 → 12512.52] Five pounds.
[12512.84 → 12519.10] There's a picture of me like seven or something like holding this thing that I
[12519.10 → 12519.24] get,
[12519.30 → 12521.86] like it looks so big because I'm so small.
[12524.24 → 12525.26] Oh my goodness.
[12527.00 → 12527.50] All right,
[12527.62 → 12528.30] let's get out of here.
[12528.80 → 12529.14] All right.
[12529.18 → 12529.84] Thanks for tuning in.
[12529.88 → 12530.54] We'll see you again next week.
[12530.62 → 12531.18] Same bad time.
[12531.24 → 12531.74] Same bad channel.
[12532.12 → 12532.52] Bye.
[12532.52 → 12532.76] Bye.
[12533.76 → 12534.20] Ow.
[12542.52 → 12543.16] Bye.
[12543.16 → 12543.28] Bye.
[12545.28 → 12545.68] Bye.
[12545.68 → 12545.92] Bye.
[12546.92 → 12546.96] Bye.
[12547.70 → 12547.74] Bye.
[12560.28 → 12560.74] Bye.
[12561.36 → 12561.66] Bye.
[12562.74 → 12563.28] Bye.
[12569.78 → 12570.22] Bye.
[12570.34 → 12570.44] Bye.
[12570.44 → 12571.40] Bye.
[12571.58 → 12571.80] Bye.
[12571.80 → 12572.10] Bye.
