[0.00 → 2.18] Welcome to the WAN show. Sorry, one sec.
[2.48 → 4.36] Oh, no! Not this side.
[4.66 → 4.98] Dang.
[10.54 → 15.94] We have got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[16.26 → 22.54] We are finally going to be doing this segment where I find out if I was right or Reddit was right
[22.54 → 27.70] about the difficulties that I had unsubscribing from Apple Arcade on my Apple TV,
[27.70 → 30.66] actually, even if it does work properly.
[30.86 → 34.14] That might mean something changed, but we'll get into that a little bit later.
[34.50 → 38.94] We're also going to be addressing the community response to our NVIDIA Super Series review.
[39.42 → 43.00] And, hey, maybe I left something for Luke to talk about.
[43.10 → 45.86] He's got to pick topics now, so he can't be distracted by his phone.
[46.74 → 47.82] Yeah, that's what I thought, Luke.
[47.90 → 49.16] Did you talk about the EVs?
[49.38 → 49.64] Nope.
[49.96 → 56.62] Oh, nice. Okay, so GM is to bring back plug-in hybrid EVs, which is awesome, actually.
[56.62 → 57.62] Yeah, hilarious.
[57.70 → 60.98] Something that we've been asking for a while now, and...
[60.98 → 63.04] Ever since they stopped making the Volt, I was like, wow.
[63.04 → 63.96] Which was an amazing car.
[64.04 → 65.26] What a terrible decision.
[65.50 → 65.72] Yeah.
[65.80 → 67.00] How could they make this to...
[67.00 → 68.68] Oh, okay, yeah, they unmade the decision.
[68.90 → 69.16] Very cool.
[69.16 → 69.78] Which is great.
[69.88 → 70.30] Good job.
[70.68 → 72.24] Did you talk about the Neuralink?
[72.58 → 72.86] Nope.
[73.26 → 75.44] And Neuralink was put in a person.
[75.64 → 77.94] Someone agreed to do that.
[78.08 → 79.76] Luke, could you pay less attention?
[80.52 → 80.96] Yes.
[81.52 → 82.26] Not much, though.
[82.26 → 82.32] No.
[82.32 → 82.38] No.
[82.38 → 82.40] No.
[82.40 → 82.44] No.
[82.44 → 82.48] No.
[82.48 → 82.54] No.
[82.54 → 82.80] No.
[82.80 → 83.32] No.
[83.32 → 84.32] No.
[84.32 → 84.38] No.
[84.38 → 84.40] No.
[84.40 → 84.48] No.
[84.48 → 84.84] No.
[84.84 → 85.32] No.
[85.32 → 85.38] No.
[85.38 → 86.32] No.
[86.32 → 86.38] No.
[86.38 → 86.40] No.
[86.40 → 87.40] No.
[87.70 → 88.20] No.
[101.88 → 106.10] The show is brought to you today by Odd Pieces, Mans caped, and Squarespace.
[106.92 → 113.18] Why don't we jump into the community response to the NVIDIA Super Series review.
[113.18 → 119.68] So, we decided, rather than to spread our coverage of NVIDIA's Super lineup, the 4070
[119.68 → 128.18] Super, 4070 Ti Super, and 4080 Super over, I think it was a grand total of, I want to say...
[128.72 → 129.38] I think it was nine?
[129.38 → 134.52] It was like, it was somewhere between seven and nine total embargo dates.
[134.52 → 135.22] I don't know either, yeah.
[135.26 → 135.88] Between the...
[135.88 → 137.02] No, I think it was seven.
[137.08 → 140.54] I think it was seven, because they had the announcement, then they had unboxing embargoes
[140.54 → 143.78] for each card, then they had review embargoes for each card.
[144.12 → 144.38] No.
[144.64 → 145.88] Then they also had a separate...
[145.88 → 146.70] Software or something?
[146.70 → 151.86] They had a separate review embargo for partner cards rather than Founders Edition cards for
[151.86 → 152.42] at least some of it.
[152.42 → 156.32] It was some ludicrous number of embargo dates, and I was kind of sitting here going, okay,
[156.42 → 162.96] so basically what you want is you want video after video after video that is
[162.96 → 166.62] just dedicated to talking about a mid-cycle refresh.
[167.66 → 168.46] Sorry, no.
[168.46 → 172.22] So, what we're going to do is we're just going to consolidate it into one video.
[172.30 → 177.90] However, there is one super thing that people are pretty upset about in this particular video,
[178.00 → 186.16] and that was the non-inclusion of AMD's RX 7900 XTX, seeing as it's widely viewed as an important
[186.16 → 192.92] competitor to the 4080 Super, not least of which because it is at the Swedish MSRP.
[192.92 → 198.24] It's actually a little bit lower from the listings that I've seen, somewhere in the kind of $930,
[198.42 → 200.80] $40 to $950 range.
[202.18 → 203.26] Oh, USD, yeah?
[203.48 → 204.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[204.54 → 205.76] Not in rubles.
[206.10 → 206.92] Canadian rubles.
[206.92 → 207.58] Also, we had our prices.
[207.72 → 208.88] I was like, that's really far off.
[208.98 → 210.66] Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[210.74 → 217.56] So, basically, I was in the room when it happened, when we made the decision to not include the
[217.56 → 219.16] 7900 XTX.
[219.16 → 225.80] I have some of my own thoughts about why we ultimately made the call that we did to include
[225.80 → 230.90] the suite of cards that we did, but I'm going to start with the news team summary from Adam,
[230.98 → 233.76] who was the writer on that project and who worked with the labs on it.
[234.32 → 240.46] Basically, point A, the decision to exclude the 7900 XTX was based on a combination of relevance
[240.46 → 241.50] and testing capacity.
[242.06 → 246.06] We saw this as a review of the new Super series as a whole.
[246.06 → 252.64] It was not a review of the 4080 Super, even though we did target close to the 4080 Super
[252.64 → 255.54] embargo, since that was the last one from the lineup.
[256.10 → 263.04] The 4080 Super is anywhere from 2% to 3% faster than a base 4080, making it more of a refresh
[263.04 → 266.86] with a price cut, essentially, is how we kind of laid it out in the video.
[266.98 → 270.06] We referred to it as 4080 refresh, 4080...
[271.18 → 274.72] Internally, we were calling it 4080 refried, 4080 redux.
[274.72 → 280.12] Retesting cards for up-to-date results takes time.
[280.46 → 282.88] We tested a total of 11 cards for this video.
[283.04 → 289.40] We haven't fully rolled out our new standardized test benches that allow us to test in parallel yet,
[289.54 → 293.72] so there was a limited number of cards that we were able to...
[294.42 → 297.58] If you are interested in that, there's a video on that that's awesome,
[297.88 → 299.32] where they test all the CPUs.
[299.36 → 300.06] Go back and check that out.
[300.06 → 304.68] We actually ended up adding a couple of cards that weren't in the original meeting,
[304.68 → 307.06] and there was one more spot where we kind of went,
[307.16 → 309.20] okay, can we test one more card?
[309.32 → 310.54] If so, what will it be?
[310.90 → 317.56] And the debate was between the 7700 XT and the 7900 XTX,
[317.62 → 321.46] and the decision was, okay, let's go with the 7700 XT.
[321.46 → 323.76] We don't want to cut the older cards.
[324.04 → 330.82] We've gotten perfect feedback from people that it's really nice to have popular older cards.
[330.94 → 338.86] So we chose our previous generation cards based on what is still holding really strong in the Steam hardware survey.
[339.08 → 342.02] We didn't want to cut those because we've gotten perfect feedback on them,
[342.02 → 348.72] and we figured that the 7700 XT would give additional context for the lower-priced cards
[348.72 → 350.84] that would be relevant to the greater number of viewers.
[352.82 → 354.82] Obviously, not everyone agrees.
[355.92 → 360.40] Number two is being selective about how many cards we retest in every video
[360.40 → 363.36] is an important consideration to avoid unnecessary stress and overtime.
[363.36 → 371.86] This is one of those funny things where it's always kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't, catch 22.
[372.28 → 378.24] If we test 35 cards, I'm going to be questioned on why we have so much crunch here.
[378.40 → 381.88] If we test three cards, I'm going to be questioned on why we're so lazy here.
[382.32 → 384.64] At the end of the day, you know, there's always trade-offs,
[384.82 → 389.52] and we ultimately made the trade-off to go with the 7700 XT rather than the 7900 XTX.
[390.10 → 392.48] There's a lot of stuff going on in the tech world right now,
[392.48 → 400.62] and I got to be honest with you guys, this wasn't the most exciting one.
[401.28 → 401.38] Yeah.
[403.02 → 406.44] And, you know, coming back to sort of my thoughts on it,
[406.50 → 409.84] first, we are going to address it.
[410.14 → 415.20] I think someone is doing some OT this weekend to test 7900 XTX.
[415.36 → 417.00] We're going to get those numbers added.
[417.00 → 424.94] But, you know, the reality of it is looking at the percentage of people that are very upset about this
[424.94 → 430.30] versus the percentage of people who are actually buying a 7900 XTX,
[430.90 → 433.30] they're very, very different.
[433.64 → 437.48] And what it seems like to me is that this is one of those things where
[437.48 → 440.94] maybe video is just, like, not the right format.
[440.94 → 444.26] Like, one of the challenges, too, is you can only include so many cards
[444.26 → 446.46] if you want to have averages, which do matter.
[446.72 → 447.16] Legible chart.
[447.32 → 451.42] And 1% lows, which, in my mind, are actually more important.
[451.52 → 454.94] If you want to have all of that in a 16 by 9 graph,
[456.02 → 459.30] it starts to get kind of illegible past a certain point,
[459.36 → 460.34] and I'm kind of looking at it going,
[460.44 → 463.06] man, you know, maybe the solution is why?
[463.06 → 468.48] Why exactly are we doing a review for a GPU anymore?
[470.64 → 473.50] I mean, we killed power supplies 10 years ago.
[473.76 → 477.14] We killed motherboards, like, 9 years ago as sort of,
[477.26 → 479.98] here's a product that merits a full LTT video.
[480.12 → 481.80] It didn't particularly perform better.
[481.88 → 484.54] No, it didn't particularly perform well at all,
[484.60 → 486.82] in spite of the fact that it was a ton of work.
[487.00 → 489.88] Like, man, let me tell you, the cards that we did test, guys,
[489.88 → 491.78] it was meticulous.
[491.92 → 494.92] We put so much flipping work into this stuff,
[495.00 → 495.84] and I'm sitting here going,
[496.34 → 498.54] if it's not about what you're actually going to buy,
[498.62 → 500.74] which is the feedback that I'm kind of hearing right now,
[500.78 → 502.78] and it's more about what, you just,
[502.86 → 504.44] you want to see it compared, right?
[504.48 → 505.90] Like, you want to see, you know,
[505.94 → 507.70] the green horse versus the red horse,
[507.76 → 509.80] which one ran the fastest, and that's fair enough,
[509.86 → 512.72] that's totally valid, but that doesn't need to be a video.
[513.64 → 516.86] And maybe the long-term solution is the lab's website,
[517.38 → 518.94] and we just basically go, okay, yeah,
[518.94 → 522.44] the card comes in, we test the stuffing out of it,
[522.94 → 524.90] and if it's actually interesting,
[525.62 → 526.92] then we make an LTT video,
[527.00 → 529.02] and we put all the effort into,
[529.14 → 530.96] all the different ways that we present the graphs,
[531.32 → 532.90] so they're paced with the script,
[533.00 → 534.96] and all the things that go into making
[534.96 → 537.46] an entertaining, dense video.
[537.82 → 541.28] I mean, I'm actually, other than that one miss,
[541.36 → 543.10] which I acknowledge 100%, yeah,
[543.26 → 545.50] looking back at it, I flagged it.
[545.50 → 549.22] I was like, hey, we should probably have the 7900 XTX,
[549.42 → 551.80] and the argument that was made to me,
[551.88 → 553.70] as I recall, was, well, here's the thing,
[553.76 → 556.44] the 7900 XT has dropped in price so much
[556.44 → 559.66] that it actually makes a ton of sense now,
[560.04 → 564.40] and so by taking this end of things,
[564.72 → 566.96] and just having the 4080 Super be there
[566.96 → 568.70] as a $1,000 card, I mean, to be clear,
[568.74 → 571.92] we never recommended spending $1,000 on a GPU at all.
[571.92 → 574.46] So just, yeah, having that thing sit there
[574.46 → 576.72] and be its thing, and then looking at anything
[576.72 → 579.54] that we actually think might be worth buying
[579.54 → 581.00] in more detail is the right approach,
[581.04 → 583.34] and I kind of went, okay, I mean,
[583.82 → 586.42] I, the enthusiast, I'm curious, I'd want to know,
[586.54 → 588.36] okay, how does the 7900 XTX stack up
[588.36 → 589.36] against the 4080 Super?
[589.46 → 592.38] It really is a fairly apples-to-apples comparison,
[592.84 → 596.24] but I accepted that, I accepted that reasoning,
[596.46 → 598.06] and I accepted the rest of the reasoning
[598.06 → 600.02] that's in our notes here today,
[600.02 → 601.88] and we ultimately didn't include it.
[602.62 → 604.78] Other than that, honestly, I'm,
[605.20 → 606.54] I think it's a great video.
[606.72 → 608.18] It's really short.
[609.64 → 611.48] One of our goals going into it
[611.48 → 616.00] was to spend absolutely zero, zero time
[616.00 → 617.38] wasting the viewer's time.
[617.62 → 620.56] So from the moment this video starts,
[621.34 → 623.46] there we go, oh,
[624.96 → 628.06] viewer time wasted.
[628.30 → 629.42] There we go, yeah, exactly.
[629.42 → 631.36] From the moment this video starts
[631.36 → 633.82] to the first performance graph is,
[633.88 → 636.02] sorry, sorry, it happened really fast,
[636.60 → 639.14] is five seconds.
[640.38 → 643.50] We wanted to get to the point right away,
[643.62 → 645.38] and then our next graph,
[645.50 → 648.88] where we basically start laying things out,
[649.18 → 649.68] here we go,
[649.76 → 651.40] we compare it to an older card,
[651.50 → 652.70] comes at about a minute,
[652.94 → 654.88] and then we get into actual results
[654.88 → 657.20] within about 80 seconds.
[657.20 → 659.28] So that was our goal.
[659.52 → 661.62] We spent a total of 13 minutes
[661.62 → 663.50] to go through this whole kind of
[663.50 → 665.92] sort of interesting launch.
[666.00 → 667.30] We talked about the changes in pricing.
[667.42 → 668.80] We talked about the changes in performance.
[668.98 → 670.78] And yeah, there's a card missing from the graphs,
[670.94 → 671.58] but...
[671.58 → 672.04] I found it.
[672.48 → 673.08] Oh, what'd you find?
[673.08 → 674.54] I found the card.
[677.54 → 678.30] So...
[678.30 → 679.12] Card located.
[679.58 → 681.94] Yeah, I can actually tell you about that.
[682.32 → 684.52] So noticing that,
[685.12 → 688.10] hey, maybe we should acknowledge this card.
[688.34 → 691.66] I think Gary actually ran some testing over the weekend,
[691.66 → 693.06] and then we added that table.
[693.06 → 696.40] But we didn't remake all the graphs
[696.40 → 697.36] because we were like,
[697.46 → 701.02] okay, it's $1,000 GPU.
[701.74 → 704.00] How many people are actually buying this
[704.00 → 707.22] versus for most people actually shopping,
[707.78 → 709.56] how much of the information
[709.56 → 711.36] have we presented in this video?
[712.74 → 713.78] Yeah, swing and a miss.
[714.20 → 716.06] But overall, I'm still...
[716.06 → 719.02] I still think this is a good direction.
[719.02 → 721.34] reducing the amount of time
[721.34 → 722.58] that it takes to process
[722.58 → 724.02] this sort of...
[725.50 → 728.38] uninteresting refreshes.
[728.54 → 732.52] And the main takeaway for me
[732.52 → 734.40] from this whole experience
[734.40 → 736.02] of that...
[736.92 → 739.14] Man, do you remember when one NVIDIA GPU
[739.14 → 742.12] was like millions of views
[742.12 → 743.66] and people were excited?
[744.54 → 745.02] And now...
[745.84 → 746.52] A pile of them.
[746.54 → 748.40] Three NVIDIA GPUs
[748.40 → 750.52] I saw one comment
[750.52 → 752.80] that really stood out to me.
[754.60 → 755.40] And it was...
[756.92 → 758.00] Minus, nothing personal.
[758.34 → 759.18] This isn't your fault.
[759.72 → 760.30] But I'm out.
[761.12 → 762.08] This is boring.
[763.70 → 765.16] These GPUs are boring.
[765.60 → 766.28] I don't care.
[768.24 → 768.76] And...
[768.76 → 771.10] I think NVIDIA feels the same way.
[771.42 → 771.68] Yeah.
[772.00 → 772.74] What's their stock up?
[772.80 → 773.68] Like six points today?
[773.88 → 774.72] Or something like that?
[774.74 → 775.16] I don't even know.
[775.16 → 776.40] Yeah, it has nothing to do
[776.40 → 778.88] with the RTX 40 Series Super launch.
[781.12 → 781.82] Five points?
[782.70 → 783.04] I don't know.
[783.14 → 784.88] It's funny reading comments like this.
[784.88 → 785.98] I usually agree with Linus,
[786.08 → 786.56] but...
[786.56 → 787.00] You know,
[787.06 → 788.26] hard pass on this reasoning.
[788.88 → 789.46] What reasoning?
[789.60 → 790.48] I said it was a miss.
[790.58 → 791.28] What do you...
[791.28 → 793.70] I'm explaining why it wasn't in there
[793.70 → 795.22] because that's what people want to know.
[795.42 → 797.00] And then I'm saying it was a miss.
[797.44 → 798.86] I don't really know what there is
[798.86 → 800.36] to disagree with at that point.
[800.68 → 801.74] Here was our reasoning.
[801.98 → 802.80] We were wrong.
[802.80 → 804.44] That person thinks it shouldn't have been in the video.
[804.72 → 805.06] I'm joking.
[805.42 → 805.86] I'm joking.
[806.16 → 806.48] I'm joking.
[806.48 → 806.50] I'm joking.
[807.28 → 809.02] Well, that makes more sense now.
[810.20 → 811.82] He's agreeing with the original decision.
[813.08 → 813.60] Um...
[813.60 → 815.56] Yeah.
[815.80 → 816.40] I...
[816.40 → 817.56] I just...
[817.56 → 820.06] I just...
[820.06 → 821.18] I just think video
[821.18 → 822.78] just might not be the right format
[822.78 → 823.86] for this anymore, though.
[824.64 → 825.28] And...
[825.28 → 826.66] I think it might depend on the card.
[827.60 → 829.04] Right, but what cards?
[829.56 → 829.88] Yeah.
[830.44 → 830.88] Name?
[830.88 → 832.16] Okay, in the last...
[832.16 → 833.60] I bet you a 5000 series launch
[833.60 → 835.68] even if the difference is this small.
[835.80 → 837.38] I bet you a 5000 series launch would kill.
[837.54 → 838.44] Here's the problem.
[839.20 → 841.58] The problem is that 5000 series
[841.58 → 843.26] is going to be flipping fast
[843.26 → 845.30] because NVIDIA has to do
[845.30 → 847.06] all the development anyway
[847.06 → 849.38] in order to make better AI accelerators.
[849.56 → 849.68] Yeah.
[849.86 → 851.72] So it's going to be flipping fast.
[851.88 → 854.50] But I wouldn't be surprised at all
[854.50 → 856.20] to see a 5090
[856.20 → 857.20] or, you know,
[857.28 → 859.08] whatever they end up calling it.
[859.18 → 859.42] Sure.
[859.42 → 861.12] TI, Super, RTI.
[861.12 → 862.58] Who knows anymore
[862.58 → 863.44] with their naming scheme.
[863.98 → 865.50] So whatever the 5090,
[865.68 → 866.62] whatever that equivalent
[866.62 → 867.76] Halo tier card is,
[868.08 → 868.94] I wouldn't be surprised
[868.94 → 869.84] to see it at $2,000.
[870.56 → 873.02] And what gamers have shown NVIDIA
[873.02 → 873.88] time and time again
[873.88 → 874.84] is that they'll pay.
[875.12 → 875.30] Yeah.
[875.30 → 877.68] Because something to consider,
[877.78 → 878.52] something that I think
[878.52 → 880.00] the components
[880.00 → 883.66] buyers don't necessarily
[883.66 → 885.18] think about that much
[885.18 → 885.92] because it's a really
[885.92 → 886.90] different perspective
[886.90 → 889.10] is that for most people,
[889.40 → 891.02] a $400 difference
[891.02 → 892.20] in the GPU
[892.20 → 895.34] is actually only about
[895.34 → 897.94] an 8% difference
[897.94 → 898.90] in the total cost
[898.90 → 899.78] of the system
[899.78 → 900.94] they were planning to buy.
[901.14 → 902.60] If you're buying a system
[902.60 → 903.70] that would have a 4090
[903.70 → 904.52] or 5090
[904.52 → 905.32] or whatever else,
[905.58 → 906.68] like some kind of
[906.68 → 908.42] Halo spec card in it,
[909.32 → 910.06] you are spending
[910.06 → 910.76] probably somewhere
[910.76 → 912.46] between $3,000 to $5,000
[912.46 → 913.50] on that computer.
[914.14 → 915.32] And so when you play around
[915.32 → 916.34] with the sliders,
[916.46 → 917.46] you're not looking at,
[917.58 → 918.24] oh, I just spent
[918.24 → 919.96] twice as much on my GPU.
[920.18 → 920.72] You're looking at,
[920.82 → 921.58] oh, I just spent
[921.58 → 924.24] 25% more
[924.24 → 925.40] on the total system
[925.40 → 926.44] for, you know,
[926.66 → 927.52] let's say,
[927.56 → 928.50] call it a 50%
[928.50 → 929.52] increase in performance
[929.52 → 929.98] or, you know,
[930.02 → 931.04] whatever that increase
[931.04 → 932.12] is generationally.
[932.12 → 933.64] So the calculus
[933.64 → 934.58] is really different
[934.58 → 936.38] and most people
[936.38 → 937.74] don't build
[937.74 → 938.68] their own computers.
[939.66 → 941.00] So the market reality
[941.00 → 941.94] that someone like
[941.94 → 942.66] an NVIDIA
[942.66 → 943.92] is setting
[943.92 → 944.46] their price
[944.46 → 945.20] according to
[945.20 → 946.90] is not aligned
[946.90 → 948.16] with the reality
[948.16 → 949.14] that we see
[949.14 → 950.30] when we put together
[950.30 → 951.50] like a price
[951.50 → 952.16] to performance
[952.16 → 953.34] like an FPS
[953.34 → 954.42] per dollar chart
[954.42 → 955.72] or something like that
[955.72 → 956.52] because the FPS
[956.52 → 957.04] per dollar
[957.04 → 957.92] that we calculate
[957.92 → 959.16] is based on
[959.16 → 960.34] only the card pricing.
[960.34 → 961.44] whereas someone
[961.44 → 961.88] who's buying
[961.88 → 962.48] a computer,
[963.00 → 963.52] someone who's buying
[963.52 → 964.70] a fully completed system
[964.70 → 965.66] is not actually
[965.66 → 966.70] looking at it that way.
[969.80 → 970.24] Yeah.
[972.60 → 973.04] Anyway,
[973.52 → 973.80] yeah,
[974.16 → 975.40] we got a million views
[975.40 → 977.20] and so I'm sitting here
[977.20 → 977.58] going,
[978.10 → 979.04] do you think that was impact?
[979.18 → 979.58] Like, do you think
[979.58 → 980.02] it would have gotten
[980.02 → 980.60] more views
[980.60 → 982.80] if the sentiment
[982.80 → 983.56] around it was better
[983.56 → 985.36] because the 7900 XTX
[985.36 → 985.82] was included?
[985.98 → 986.54] No, I don't think so.
[986.62 → 987.18] I think it's a
[987.18 → 989.94] it's a small number
[989.94 → 990.36] of people
[990.36 → 991.38] who are upset about it
[991.38 → 992.34] in the grand scheme
[992.34 → 992.76] of things.
[992.90 → 994.04] The like-dislike ratio
[994.04 → 994.64] in this video,
[995.20 → 995.92] I can bring this up
[995.92 → 996.36] for you guys,
[996.80 → 998.68] is actually not abnormal
[998.68 → 999.58] in any way.
[1000.98 → 1001.20] Here,
[1001.32 → 1001.92] let me pull it up.
[1006.24 → 1006.96] There we go.
[1009.78 → 1010.26] Analytics.
[1010.26 → 1010.42] Analytics.
[1011.62 → 1012.98] So it's net positive
[1012.98 → 1013.96] for subscribers.
[1013.96 → 1014.26] subscribers.
[1014.88 → 1017.64] Engagement is about
[1017.64 → 1018.44] a percent below
[1018.44 → 1019.26] channel average,
[1019.40 → 1020.90] but it started out
[1020.90 → 1021.76] for the first
[1021.76 → 1023.48] probably eight hours
[1023.48 → 1023.94] or so,
[1024.06 → 1025.12] a percent above
[1025.12 → 1025.98] channel average.
[1026.18 → 1027.34] It started out
[1027.34 → 1028.12] being received
[1028.12 → 1029.28] extremely well
[1029.28 → 1030.78] and then over time
[1030.78 → 1031.96] as people have
[1031.96 → 1033.46] piled into the comments,
[1033.98 → 1035.62] it's been received
[1035.62 → 1036.46] much more poorly.
[1036.84 → 1037.42] Sentiments shifting.
[1037.56 → 1037.70] Yep,
[1037.82 → 1038.54] sentiments shifted.
[1039.10 → 1039.68] I've seen that before.
[1039.68 → 1040.90] And so,
[1041.72 → 1042.36] oh yeah,
[1042.46 → 1043.92] view duration is,
[1043.98 → 1044.10] oh,
[1044.18 → 1044.72] view duration
[1044.72 → 1046.90] is extremely low.
[1048.44 → 1048.84] Wow.
[1049.24 → 1049.74] You gave them
[1049.74 → 1050.34] the whole story
[1050.34 → 1051.12] at five seconds.
[1051.28 → 1051.42] Oh,
[1051.48 → 1052.32] this is amazing.
[1053.02 → 1053.40] So yeah,
[1053.48 → 1054.76] this is what happens
[1054.76 → 1055.64] when you're basically like,
[1055.72 → 1055.86] okay,
[1055.90 → 1056.06] yeah,
[1056.12 → 1057.46] here's the deal.
[1057.66 → 1058.20] Here's what's up
[1058.20 → 1058.66] with this thing
[1058.66 → 1059.54] in the first two minutes.
[1059.72 → 1061.22] So we get to 1080p results
[1061.22 → 1062.50] and everyone's like,
[1062.88 → 1063.78] see you later.
[1063.78 → 1065.80] So this gray band
[1065.80 → 1066.34] right here
[1066.34 → 1069.00] is your typical duration
[1069.00 → 1070.58] for a video of this length
[1070.58 → 1072.04] or your typical retention
[1072.04 → 1072.94] on this channel.
[1073.08 → 1074.74] So this is specifically
[1074.74 → 1075.90] relevant to our channel.
[1078.00 → 1079.62] All anyone wants to see
[1079.62 → 1081.18] is a graph
[1081.18 → 1083.24] and then the rest of it
[1083.24 → 1084.36] is just kind of like
[1084.36 → 1086.62] noise apparently.
[1088.12 → 1089.46] So this is one of those things
[1089.46 → 1089.84] where
[1089.84 → 1092.68] I think people think
[1092.68 → 1093.74] they want to see
[1093.74 → 1094.46] a lot of graphs
[1094.46 → 1095.56] and a lot of visualizations
[1095.56 → 1096.54] and a lot of analysis.
[1096.82 → 1097.62] They want it to be interesting.
[1097.94 → 1099.20] But what they actually want
[1099.20 → 1099.88] is to watch
[1099.88 → 1100.78] an interesting video.
[1101.58 → 1101.90] And
[1101.90 → 1104.04] what really stands out
[1104.04 → 1104.78] to me about
[1104.78 → 1105.98] this particular one
[1105.98 → 1106.82] is,
[1106.92 → 1107.50] and to be clear,
[1107.60 → 1108.14] I'm not saying
[1108.14 → 1109.50] we're not going to cover GPUs.
[1110.08 → 1110.94] I'm just saying
[1110.94 → 1113.24] it's probably going to end up
[1113.24 → 1113.98] being on short circuit.
[1114.60 → 1116.14] Or not be like a default.
[1116.90 → 1117.60] You're not going to
[1117.60 → 1119.08] cover it by default anymore.
[1119.26 → 1120.16] Or we'll do it
[1120.16 → 1121.94] but not bother doing it
[1121.94 → 1122.44] at embargo.
[1122.68 → 1123.64] Why are we bothering?
[1124.44 → 1125.24] Let's test it.
[1125.30 → 1126.04] Sure, we'll test it
[1126.04 → 1126.64] before embargo.
[1126.78 → 1127.20] We'll make sure
[1127.20 → 1128.34] the thing's actually interesting.
[1128.66 → 1129.48] And then let's put together
[1129.48 → 1130.62] a cool project with it
[1130.62 → 1131.08] or something.
[1131.70 → 1132.74] Rather than just saying
[1132.74 → 1134.56] here's a GPU.
[1135.48 → 1137.36] Or maybe we consolidate it.
[1137.74 → 1137.90] You know,
[1137.96 → 1138.70] we do a quarterly
[1138.70 → 1140.38] GPU update.
[1141.08 → 1141.66] That's kind of cool.
[1141.78 → 1143.08] I would click on that
[1143.08 → 1143.52] personally.
[1143.60 → 1144.58] Because the problem with
[1144.58 → 1146.54] at launch videos,
[1146.72 → 1148.20] and this is an inherent problem,
[1148.28 → 1148.94] this is not something
[1148.94 → 1150.22] that I think anyone can solve,
[1150.22 → 1151.26] is that you're taking
[1151.26 → 1152.54] the manufacturer's word
[1152.54 → 1153.68] for what the street pricing
[1153.68 → 1154.42] is going to be.
[1154.74 → 1156.06] And that ended up causing
[1156.06 → 1158.86] a lot of backlash
[1158.86 → 1161.72] toward the reviewer community
[1161.72 → 1163.36] back when NVIDIA
[1163.36 → 1164.20] and their partners
[1164.20 → 1165.20] were increasing pricing
[1165.20 → 1166.12] on the 30 series.
[1166.48 → 1168.16] Because we would review a card
[1168.16 → 1169.54] with the best information
[1169.54 → 1170.56] we have at the time,
[1171.08 → 1172.12] and then it would turn out
[1172.12 → 1172.54] that it would have
[1172.54 → 1173.16] a street price
[1173.16 → 1173.60] that's 20,
[1173.70 → 1173.98] 30,
[1173.98 → 1174.66] 50,
[1174.80 → 1176.16] 100% higher.
[1176.84 → 1177.72] And all of a sudden,
[1177.82 → 1178.42] it's our fault,
[1178.46 → 1179.20] and we're sitting here going,
[1179.82 → 1180.82] crying out loud, guys,
[1181.00 → 1182.02] yeah,
[1182.26 → 1185.00] in the past,
[1185.06 → 1185.52] they've been off
[1185.52 → 1186.26] by a little bit,
[1186.34 → 1186.94] but my goodness,
[1187.06 → 1187.94] this has never happened
[1187.94 → 1188.82] like this before.
[1189.36 → 1190.06] And so,
[1190.26 → 1191.60] if we do something
[1191.60 → 1193.22] like a quarterly update,
[1193.52 → 1194.28] then we can basically
[1194.28 → 1194.64] just go,
[1194.74 → 1195.02] okay, yeah,
[1195.08 → 1196.02] here's the actual
[1196.02 → 1196.70] street pricing,
[1197.30 → 1198.00] here's the testing
[1198.00 → 1199.84] for this particular card,
[1199.92 → 1200.64] the one that anyone
[1200.64 → 1201.62] is actually buying,
[1201.70 → 1202.68] because we can look at,
[1202.76 → 1202.90] okay,
[1202.90 → 1204.00] what's getting
[1204.00 → 1204.72] the most reviews,
[1205.08 → 1205.90] what is actually
[1205.90 → 1206.96] ranking high
[1206.96 → 1207.92] on,
[1208.00 → 1208.34] you know,
[1208.54 → 1209.28]  bestsellers
[1209.28 → 1210.56] at sites like New egg
[1210.56 → 1211.02] or Amazon
[1211.02 → 1211.74] or Best Buy
[1211.74 → 1212.90] or whatever the case may be,
[1213.36 → 1215.06] and we can give you guys
[1215.06 → 1216.16] a snapshot
[1216.16 → 1217.24] of what the market
[1217.24 → 1217.98] looks like
[1217.98 → 1219.58] without any constraints,
[1220.02 → 1221.18] like being limited
[1221.18 → 1222.14] to pricing information
[1222.14 → 1223.40] that is provided to us
[1223.40 → 1225.30] in a very optimistic form
[1225.30 → 1226.96] by the GPU chipset maker.
[1226.96 → 1233.02] Yeah.
[1233.12 → 1233.30] Right.
[1233.42 → 1233.56] So,
[1233.64 → 1234.42] the reason I had,
[1234.46 → 1235.84] the reason I had brought this up
[1235.84 → 1237.16] was because,
[1237.32 → 1237.46] here,
[1237.52 → 1237.74] hold on,
[1237.76 → 1238.68] I'm just going to
[1238.68 → 1239.90] filter by,
[1240.44 → 1241.32] and to be clear,
[1241.38 → 1241.64] guys,
[1242.24 → 1243.74] views is not
[1243.74 → 1244.78] to be all
[1244.78 → 1245.22] and end all.
[1245.28 → 1246.10] It's not the only reason
[1246.10 → 1246.78] we make videos.
[1246.86 → 1247.38] We make videos
[1247.38 → 1248.48] because we think
[1248.48 → 1249.52] something's really cool
[1249.52 → 1250.66] or we make it
[1250.66 → 1251.30] because
[1251.30 → 1253.38] we think
[1253.38 → 1254.50] this is something
[1254.50 → 1255.84] that's never been done before
[1255.84 → 1257.04] or because we think
[1257.04 → 1257.86] it's something people
[1257.86 → 1259.64] really need to know.
[1260.40 → 1260.84] Occasionally,
[1260.84 → 1261.54] it's just because
[1261.54 → 1263.10] I'm really passionate
[1263.10 → 1263.60] about something,
[1263.64 → 1264.62] I want to talk about it.
[1264.90 → 1265.48] We have a video
[1265.48 → 1266.36] coming up soon
[1266.36 → 1268.12] that is not
[1268.12 → 1268.54] going to get
[1268.54 → 1269.22] a lot of views.
[1269.50 → 1270.44] It's going to be called
[1270.44 → 1271.80] Stop Calling Them Chrome books.
[1272.68 → 1273.12] Oh.
[1273.58 → 1274.54] And it's basically,
[1275.08 → 1276.86] I don't know,
[1276.96 → 1277.68] video essay
[1277.68 → 1280.00] or kind of chat
[1280.00 → 1282.36] about how I believe
[1282.36 → 1283.28] that Chrome books
[1283.28 → 1285.10] are going to become
[1285.10 → 1285.86] laptops.
[1286.62 → 1287.44] We're not going to call
[1287.44 → 1288.26] them Chrome books anymore.
[1288.32 → 1288.66] We're going to call
[1288.66 → 1289.16] them laptops
[1289.16 → 1289.90] because
[1289.90 → 1291.58] did you know
[1291.58 → 1292.34] that it is
[1292.34 → 1293.90] one checkbox now
[1293.90 → 1295.18] to just
[1295.18 → 1297.28] turn Chrome OS
[1297.28 → 1298.32] into I can install
[1298.32 → 1298.80] any Linux
[1298.80 → 1299.74] thing that I want?
[1302.44 → 1303.20] I know,
[1303.30 → 1303.74] I had no idea.
[1303.84 → 1303.96] Yeah.
[1304.34 → 1304.74] So,
[1305.30 → 1306.22] Chrome OS
[1306.22 → 1308.52] is Linux
[1308.52 → 1309.02] with
[1309.02 → 1309.10] Chrome OS
[1309.10 → 1309.88] might be the year
[1309.88 → 1310.82] of the Linux desktop.
[1312.32 → 1312.84] So that,
[1312.98 → 1314.24] that's my thesis.
[1314.88 → 1315.90] How many people,
[1316.22 → 1317.06] I just speed ran
[1317.06 → 1317.56] how many people
[1317.56 → 1318.22] I can piss off.
[1318.94 → 1319.44] I know.
[1319.80 → 1320.52] I know.
[1321.28 → 1321.68] Sorry.
[1323.06 → 1323.88] That's not going to get
[1323.88 → 1324.58] a ton of views.
[1325.82 → 1326.26] So,
[1326.44 → 1327.24] my point is that
[1327.24 → 1328.88] it's not the only calculus
[1328.88 → 1330.28] but it is something
[1330.28 → 1330.90] that we have to
[1330.90 → 1332.00] at least consider.
[1333.06 → 1334.44] We have people
[1334.44 → 1335.84] who I actually,
[1336.08 → 1336.62] it turns out,
[1336.70 → 1337.38] cannot pay
[1337.38 → 1338.82] in graphics cards
[1338.82 → 1339.62] and water bottles.
[1340.16 → 1341.26] They do need to be
[1341.26 → 1341.94] paid with money
[1341.94 → 1343.32] and if we aren't
[1343.32 → 1343.98] making content
[1343.98 → 1344.84] that people,
[1345.24 → 1346.80] and the other thing
[1346.80 → 1347.56] is that if it's not
[1347.56 → 1348.34] getting views,
[1349.44 → 1349.70] well,
[1349.76 → 1350.48] that's an indication
[1350.48 → 1351.08] that it's something
[1351.08 → 1352.40] people don't want to watch.
[1353.26 → 1353.92] And so,
[1353.98 → 1354.68] we should definitely
[1354.68 → 1355.48] be making videos
[1355.48 → 1356.32] people want to watch.
[1356.38 → 1357.00] And I mean,
[1357.04 → 1357.70] have a look at,
[1357.76 → 1358.66] have a look at the other stuff
[1358.66 → 1359.14] we uploaded
[1359.14 → 1360.08] in the last little while.
[1360.62 → 1360.94] So,
[1361.14 → 1362.36] for this graphics card,
[1364.04 → 1364.80] we get,
[1365.12 → 1365.46] you know,
[1366.34 → 1367.24] this will end up
[1367.24 → 1368.56] probably in the 1.3,
[1368.68 → 1370.34] 1.4 range.
[1370.96 → 1372.26] It has a below average.
[1372.32 → 1372.44] So,
[1372.48 → 1373.34] our average is around
[1373.34 → 1374.68] 97.5%
[1374.68 → 1375.36] for like,
[1375.42 → 1376.10] dislike ratio.
[1376.62 → 1376.90] Okay.
[1377.64 → 1378.04] So,
[1379.04 → 1380.66] I did a tour
[1380.66 → 1381.52] of a building
[1381.52 → 1382.22] we bought
[1382.22 → 1383.48] talking about
[1383.48 → 1383.92] how we're going
[1383.92 → 1384.88] to run lands there.
[1385.74 → 1386.62] People flippin'
[1386.76 → 1387.36] love it.
[1387.64 → 1388.80] Way more viewership.
[1389.78 → 1390.62] We collab
[1390.62 → 1391.60] with someone cool
[1391.60 → 1392.26] like Media,
[1392.40 → 1393.10] Electro Boom.
[1393.26 → 1393.88] That video is fun.
[1394.26 → 1395.26] People flippin'
[1395.42 → 1395.88] love it
[1395.88 → 1396.74] and watch the crap
[1396.74 → 1397.22] out of it.
[1397.54 → 1397.86] We just,
[1398.12 → 1398.86] we come in on
[1398.86 → 1399.52] the weekend
[1399.52 → 1401.00] and just upgrade
[1401.00 → 1402.22] the network infrastructure
[1402.22 → 1403.80] above average.
[1405.22 → 1405.66] Even,
[1405.84 → 1406.10] even,
[1406.26 → 1406.78] even this,
[1406.86 → 1408.28] even this dry as toast.
[1408.88 → 1409.28] Hey,
[1409.34 → 1410.52] here are 12 CPUs
[1410.52 → 1411.20] and we tested them.
[1411.28 → 1411.40] Yeah,
[1411.48 → 1412.12] it didn't get views,
[1412.20 → 1412.76] which we knew
[1412.76 → 1413.74] it wasn't going to,
[1413.82 → 1414.34] but we just thought
[1414.34 → 1414.86] it was really important.
[1414.88 → 1416.00] It's a sick video though.
[1416.22 → 1416.48] So,
[1416.74 → 1417.90] let's see how far back
[1417.90 → 1418.68] we have to go
[1418.68 → 1419.82] to find something
[1419.82 → 1420.54] that people are
[1420.54 → 1422.26] just as apathetic about
[1422.26 → 1423.56] as NVIDIA's
[1423.56 → 1424.40] super launch.
[1424.94 → 1425.84] Let's keep going,
[1426.04 → 1426.88] let's keep going,
[1427.06 → 1427.58] let's keep going.
[1427.64 → 1427.78] I mean,
[1427.86 → 1428.04] even,
[1428.18 → 1428.40] okay,
[1428.52 → 1428.90] here we go,
[1428.96 → 1429.24] here we go,
[1429.28 → 1429.66] here we go.
[1430.54 → 1430.76] No,
[1430.88 → 1433.16] even this sponsored video
[1433.16 → 1434.54] on Asus's
[1434.54 → 1436.54] Zephyrus laptop refresh.
[1436.86 → 1438.08] Can't get that low.
[1438.52 → 1439.60] Let's keep going.
[1442.04 → 1442.84] And guys,
[1443.06 → 1443.62] no,
[1443.62 → 1444.72] I don't think
[1444.72 → 1445.86] that all this negativity
[1445.86 → 1447.24] just comes down to
[1447.24 → 1448.44] that people are actually
[1448.44 → 1449.18] that upset
[1449.18 → 1450.76] about one GPU
[1450.76 → 1451.74] that wasn't included.
[1453.74 → 1454.60] Here we go.
[1454.92 → 1455.42] Here it is.
[1455.98 → 1456.82] For Air jet,
[1456.92 → 1457.58] where we like
[1457.58 → 1459.08] mangled that MacBook,
[1459.08 → 1462.58] where we mangled
[1462.58 → 1463.06] that MacBook.
[1465.64 → 1466.70] And I think that
[1466.70 → 1467.82] really a big part of that
[1467.82 → 1468.74] was probably the title.
[1469.22 → 1470.60] We've updated the title now
[1470.60 → 1471.18] to include
[1471.18 → 1471.76] for systems,
[1471.88 → 1472.06] whatever.
[1472.24 → 1473.20] That usually happens
[1473.20 → 1474.08] anywhere from a week
[1474.08 → 1474.84] to three weeks
[1474.84 → 1475.60] after we upload.
[1475.70 → 1476.22] We'll add a more,
[1476.42 → 1477.18] a better descriptor
[1477.18 → 1477.64] at the end.
[1477.64 → 1480.28] But I think some people
[1480.28 → 1481.12] thought it was going
[1481.12 → 1482.02] to be more
[1482.02 → 1483.30] something Apple
[1483.30 → 1484.54] can do immediately
[1484.54 → 1485.10] or something.
[1485.26 → 1485.84] And so there was
[1485.84 → 1486.82] a little bit of bounce
[1486.82 → 1487.50] off of that video.
[1487.58 → 1488.02] But overall,
[1488.10 → 1488.64] it was one that
[1488.64 → 1489.34] the comments
[1489.34 → 1489.94] are overwhelmingly
[1489.94 → 1490.64] positive on.
[1490.74 → 1491.60] So I think it was just,
[1492.04 → 1494.08] I mean,
[1494.08 → 1494.74] everything is just
[1494.74 → 1495.28] kind of like
[1495.28 → 1496.46] crystal ball
[1496.46 → 1497.92] at a certain point.
[1498.46 → 1498.66] You know,
[1498.70 → 1499.94] why did people like this
[1499.94 → 1500.56] or not like it?
[1500.56 → 1501.30] And you can read
[1501.30 → 1501.98] a lot of comments.
[1501.98 → 1502.64] You can look at
[1502.64 → 1503.30] a lot of analytics.
[1503.30 → 1504.44] But there's always
[1504.44 → 1505.00] going to be a little
[1505.00 → 1505.98] bit of guesswork involved.
[1506.40 → 1507.16] But at the end
[1507.16 → 1507.66] of the day,
[1508.46 → 1509.58] yeah,
[1509.68 → 1509.88] this,
[1510.00 → 1513.80] it's a high risk,
[1513.98 → 1515.44] low reward video.
[1516.54 → 1517.92] I like the idea
[1517.92 → 1519.86] of we'll still
[1519.86 → 1520.72] produce that type
[1520.72 → 1521.42] of content.
[1521.58 → 1521.74] Yeah.
[1521.84 → 1522.96] It'll just be an article
[1522.96 → 1524.02] on the lab's website.
[1524.08 → 1524.72] It'll be a craft.
[1524.94 → 1525.76] And if it's
[1525.76 → 1526.92] in the creation
[1526.92 → 1527.36] of that,
[1527.42 → 1527.76] we're like,
[1527.86 → 1528.08] whoa,
[1528.12 → 1529.42] there's a cool story here.
[1529.98 → 1530.96] Now there's a video.
[1531.06 → 1531.70] Now there's a video.
[1531.84 → 1532.30] Because that's,
[1532.30 → 1532.78] that's something
[1532.78 → 1533.54] we've discussed
[1533.54 → 1535.06] about how the lab site
[1535.06 → 1535.52] could work
[1535.52 → 1536.58] for a really long time.
[1536.72 → 1536.82] Yeah.
[1536.86 → 1537.52] So you can still
[1537.52 → 1539.36] come to Linus Tech Tips,
[1539.46 → 1540.08] Linus Media Group
[1540.08 → 1540.68] to get this type
[1540.68 → 1541.24] of information.
[1541.82 → 1542.94] Just clearly
[1542.94 → 1543.58] you're sniping
[1543.58 → 1544.42] the video for graphs
[1544.42 → 1544.84] anyway.
[1545.76 → 1547.12] So just go to the site
[1547.12 → 1547.88] and get the graphs.
[1548.04 → 1548.22] Yeah.
[1548.72 → 1548.96] Yeah.
[1549.92 → 1550.46] Like that's,
[1550.52 → 1551.38] that way there's just,
[1551.48 → 1552.40] there's zero wasting
[1552.40 → 1553.76] of anyone's time.
[1553.84 → 1554.50] This is all you
[1554.50 → 1555.38] want to know anyway.
[1555.60 → 1555.82] Yeah.
[1556.02 → 1556.94] And then we need
[1556.94 → 1557.64] to test the stuff
[1557.64 → 1558.36] anyhow.
[1558.88 → 1559.76] Because I want to do,
[1559.84 → 1560.30] I want to do more
[1560.30 → 1560.86] build videos
[1560.86 → 1561.60] and stuff like that.
[1561.64 → 1562.06] I want to,
[1562.06 → 1563.08] I want to do cool builds.
[1563.08 → 1564.08] I want to do more,
[1564.42 → 1565.94] I want to do more roundups.
[1566.06 → 1567.04] I want to do more,
[1567.26 → 1568.76] just kind of updates,
[1568.90 → 1570.22] keeping people up to date.
[1570.36 → 1571.00] So we have to do
[1571.00 → 1571.84] the testing anyway.
[1572.08 → 1573.68] But we don't have to do it
[1573.68 → 1574.42] on embargo day.
[1575.06 → 1576.70] We don't have to do it
[1576.70 → 1577.84] under constraints
[1577.84 → 1579.44] like not having
[1579.44 → 1580.66] proper access
[1580.66 → 1581.90] to what the exact pricing
[1581.90 → 1582.50] is going to be
[1582.50 → 1583.56] prior to publishing time.
[1583.56 → 1584.84] pull like crazy
[1584.84 → 1585.84] fever dream
[1585.84 → 1586.58] all-nighters
[1586.58 → 1587.94] and weekends
[1587.94 → 1588.88] and stuff like that.
[1589.34 → 1589.48] Yep.
[1589.58 → 1589.96] I think,
[1590.46 → 1590.82] you know,
[1590.86 → 1591.52] at the end of the day,
[1591.52 → 1592.26] this is not
[1592.26 → 1593.50] entirely my decision.
[1593.50 → 1594.10] This is something
[1594.10 → 1594.76] that we're going to
[1594.76 → 1595.74] talk to the team about,
[1595.90 → 1597.12] but it's also
[1597.12 → 1598.20] not something
[1598.20 → 1598.68] that I think
[1598.68 → 1599.90] is that outlandish anymore.
[1600.26 → 1601.14] And we've seen
[1601.14 → 1602.50] this decline over time.
[1602.58 → 1603.50] This is not the first time
[1603.50 → 1604.30] we've asked,
[1604.40 → 1604.94] should we do
[1604.94 → 1606.02] GPU reviews anymore?
[1606.92 → 1608.24] I think the first,
[1608.40 → 1609.00] I'm trying to think,
[1609.34 → 1610.34] I'm trying to think
[1610.34 → 1611.86] of a GPU that launched.
[1615.24 → 1616.62] Looking at all the negativity
[1616.62 → 1617.82] around 40 series,
[1618.36 → 1618.98] that was,
[1619.02 → 1619.74] that was certainly
[1619.74 → 1620.64] a time when we wondered.
[1620.76 → 1621.80] I would say probably
[1621.80 → 1623.26] around the time
[1623.26 → 1624.26] of 40,
[1624.64 → 1625.78] 60 series
[1625.78 → 1627.04] and the 7600.
[1627.80 → 1628.76] We were just looking
[1628.76 → 1629.42] at it going,
[1631.82 → 1633.64] if AMD and NVIDIA
[1633.64 → 1634.90] can't even care
[1634.90 → 1635.76] about this,
[1636.02 → 1637.34] category,
[1637.84 → 1641.20] how can they possibly
[1641.20 → 1642.30] expect their customers
[1642.30 → 1642.84] to care?
[1643.30 → 1644.44] And if their customers
[1644.44 → 1645.14] don't care,
[1646.38 → 1647.88] why are we,
[1647.98 → 1649.38] why are we covering it?
[1651.46 → 1651.98] Yeah.
[1654.82 → 1655.34] Man,
[1655.50 → 1656.58] I'm trying to think.
[1656.80 → 1657.90] Probably the peak
[1657.90 → 1658.62] would have been
[1658.62 → 1659.38] the announcement
[1659.38 → 1660.60] of the 3080.
[1663.86 → 1665.46] When was that exactly?
[1666.02 → 1667.20] Um,
[1667.86 → 1669.44] I think you'll be
[1669.44 → 1670.36] surprised
[1670.36 → 1671.88] how long ago
[1671.88 → 1672.38] it was.
[1672.88 → 1673.46] I'm trying to.
[1673.50 → 1674.30] So that was also
[1674.30 → 1676.72] at a very particular time,
[1676.72 → 1677.60] which makes sense
[1677.60 → 1678.34] why it would have peaked.
[1678.68 → 1679.62] September 17th,
[1679.64 → 1679.94] 2020,
[1679.94 → 1681.20] when everyone was like,
[1681.44 → 1681.82] here it is.
[1681.82 → 1683.06] I'm going to stay indoors
[1683.06 → 1684.76] for a super long time.
[1684.86 → 1685.64] This was the peak.
[1685.84 → 1687.12] And you can play video games
[1687.12 → 1687.52] on computers?
[1687.52 → 1688.82] 5.1 million views.
[1688.90 → 1689.12] And yeah,
[1689.12 → 1689.86] it's been three years
[1689.86 → 1690.18] or whatever,
[1690.18 → 1690.92] but don't kid yourself.
[1690.98 → 1692.06] Nobody's watching that today.
[1692.52 → 1692.54] Yeah.
[1692.62 → 1693.16] That was,
[1693.30 → 1695.16] that took off
[1695.16 → 1696.50] like a rocket ship.
[1696.64 → 1698.24] And then the actual review,
[1698.24 → 1701.12] yeah,
[1701.30 → 1702.84] that was the last time
[1702.84 → 1703.84] people cared
[1703.84 → 1705.30] about a GPU launch.
[1705.70 → 1705.90] Yeah.
[1706.82 → 1708.08] What was the 4080 launch?
[1708.50 → 1708.80] Brutal.
[1709.42 → 1709.68] Uh,
[1709.68 → 1709.80] yeah,
[1709.80 → 1710.34] we can have a look.
[1711.76 → 1712.24] 4080.
[1713.00 → 1713.14] Right.
[1713.14 → 1717.02] 1.1 million.
[1717.48 → 1718.20] No way.
[1718.42 → 1718.84] No one cared.
[1719.26 → 1720.02] No way.
[1720.18 → 1720.38] Price.
[1720.50 → 1722.60] It's a $1,200 graphics card.
[1722.66 → 1723.50] Who gives a shit?
[1723.68 → 1723.92] Yeah,
[1723.98 → 1724.50] fair enough.
[1724.64 → 1725.20] $1,200.
[1725.42 → 1725.98] I could buy,
[1726.08 → 1727.74] I could buy a PlayStation 5.
[1728.08 → 1730.06] I could buy an Xbox Series X.
[1730.20 → 1730.48] And a TV.
[1730.48 → 1732.12] I could buy an extra controller
[1732.12 → 1733.40] for each of my bros.
[1734.58 → 1735.24] For each,
[1735.36 → 1735.60] I'm sorry,
[1735.68 → 1736.70] for each of those consoles.
[1736.88 → 1737.10] So,
[1737.26 → 1737.50] you know,
[1737.52 → 1738.38] me and my little brother
[1738.38 → 1739.18] or my little sister
[1739.18 → 1740.06] can play together.
[1740.52 → 1741.36] And some games.
[1742.32 → 1742.72] No,
[1742.72 → 1743.88] because it's $500 each
[1743.88 → 1744.50] for those consoles.
[1744.66 → 1744.96] Is it?
[1745.20 → 1745.48] Yeah.
[1746.04 → 1746.42] Well,
[1746.52 → 1746.80] okay.
[1746.92 → 1748.88] Not if I get the digital edition.
[1748.94 → 1749.42] But if I'm buying
[1749.42 → 1750.30] first-party controllers,
[1751.00 → 1751.76] You're also probably
[1751.76 → 1752.32] getting bundles.
[1752.42 → 1753.32] If I don't buy
[1753.32 → 1754.32] first-party controllers,
[1754.50 → 1754.70] though,
[1754.88 → 1755.12] yeah,
[1755.20 → 1756.28] I might even be able
[1756.28 → 1757.24] to squeeze in a TV.
[1758.14 → 1758.50] Maybe.
[1758.82 → 1759.88] It'd be really tight.
[1759.90 → 1760.82] I was assuming
[1760.82 → 1761.30] once you added
[1761.30 → 1762.26] the second console and stuff,
[1762.32 → 1762.72] I was assuming
[1762.72 → 1763.22] you weren't going
[1763.22 → 1763.80] the TV route.
[1764.12 → 1764.28] Oh,
[1764.34 → 1764.48] okay,
[1764.54 → 1764.70] okay,
[1764.74 → 1764.90] okay.
[1765.20 → 1765.36] No,
[1765.52 → 1766.26] or I could,
[1766.38 → 1767.28] or to your point,
[1767.46 → 1768.56] I could buy a console,
[1768.86 → 1769.84] a full complement
[1769.84 → 1771.16] of first-party controllers
[1771.16 → 1772.26] and a decent TV.
[1772.72 → 1774.18] And your console
[1774.18 → 1774.68] is very likely
[1774.68 → 1775.64] coming with a bundle
[1775.64 → 1776.28] of these
[1776.28 → 1777.10] It's f***ING ridiculous.
[1777.78 → 1777.96] Like,
[1778.00 → 1778.54] it just doesn't,
[1778.60 → 1779.12] it doesn't make
[1779.12 → 1780.10] any sense anymore.
[1781.80 → 1782.24] Yeah.
[1783.62 → 1784.06] Oh,
[1784.22 → 1785.34] I don't know.
[1785.42 → 1785.82] I just,
[1786.08 → 1786.80] and I'm tired
[1786.80 → 1787.68] of being mad.
[1789.46 → 1790.44] Isn't anyone else
[1790.44 → 1791.16] just tired
[1791.16 → 1792.12] of being mad?
[1792.38 → 1792.94] I don't know
[1792.94 → 1793.42] if they are,
[1793.62 → 1794.46] but I am.
[1794.86 → 1795.88] It's exhausting.
[1795.88 → 1796.18] It's,
[1796.18 → 1797.44] yeah,
[1797.78 → 1798.04] yeah,
[1798.04 → 1798.42] it is.
[1798.86 → 1799.28] I don't know.
[1799.28 → 1799.80] And like,
[1799.84 → 1800.88] to be completely honest,
[1801.20 → 1802.96] a lot of the old cards
[1802.96 → 1803.48] are fine.
[1805.32 → 1806.16] I don't know.
[1806.56 → 1807.00] Like,
[1807.24 → 1808.42] 1440p monitors,
[1809.38 → 1812.86] 90 to 144 frames per second.
[1813.96 → 1814.80] Decently old cards
[1814.80 → 1815.42] are running a lot
[1815.42 → 1815.98] of new games,
[1816.10 → 1816.68] no problem.
[1816.76 → 1817.00] Yep,
[1817.08 → 1817.42] I mean,
[1817.54 → 1818.76] at very respectable settings.
[1818.96 → 1819.74] We did this video
[1819.74 → 1820.68] a little while back,
[1820.76 → 1821.24] only you can,
[1821.28 → 1821.72] this is a
[1821.78 → 1822.16] this is probably
[1822.16 → 1822.82] a bad title.
[1823.02 → 1823.54] I don't know
[1823.54 → 1824.30] how to fix it though,
[1824.30 → 1825.78] because it's sort of a
[1827.36 → 1829.12] yeah,
[1829.20 → 1829.48] I don't know
[1829.48 → 1829.94] how to fix it,
[1829.96 → 1830.52] but basically,
[1830.70 → 1830.80] I,
[1830.80 → 1831.44] I scrapyards,
[1831.70 → 1832.74] scrapyard warned
[1832.74 → 1834.40] a single GPU.
[1834.90 → 1835.66] The only solution
[1835.66 → 1836.58] to GPU pricing.
[1836.94 → 1837.26] Yeah.
[1838.20 → 1838.64] Um,
[1839.82 → 1841.04] what a great intro
[1841.04 → 1841.50] that was,
[1841.60 → 1842.38] bag to GPU.
[1842.72 → 1843.06] Anyway,
[1843.30 → 1845.50] the point is,
[1846.14 → 1846.60] um,
[1847.80 → 1849.00] instead of being mad,
[1849.10 → 1849.92] just don't give them
[1849.92 → 1850.32] your money.
[1850.82 → 1850.88] Yeah.
[1850.96 → 1852.06] Buy a secondhand GPU.
[1852.20 → 1853.12] There's a lot of them
[1853.12 → 1853.52] out there.
[1853.52 → 1854.50] And they're generally
[1854.50 → 1855.96] in a perfect condition.
[1856.68 → 1857.58] I don't think I've,
[1857.64 → 1857.96] or not,
[1858.04 → 1859.72] personally ever bought one
[1859.72 → 1860.68] that ended up being a problem.
[1860.70 → 1861.48] Or with a little bit
[1861.48 → 1862.28] of MacGyver know-how.
[1862.34 → 1862.44] I mean,
[1862.46 → 1863.20] the one that I bought
[1863.20 → 1863.92] in this video
[1863.92 → 1864.76] had a fan that was
[1864.76 → 1865.74] a little bit squeaky.
[1866.16 → 1866.32] Yeah,
[1866.32 → 1866.46] yeah,
[1866.46 → 1866.52] yeah.
[1866.52 → 1866.84] Um,
[1867.36 → 1867.72] okay,
[1867.78 → 1868.64] but that's fixable
[1868.64 → 1870.28] with like a $4 fan
[1870.28 → 1871.38] off of AliExpress.
[1871.66 → 1872.26] Like the
[1872.80 → 1874.78] I,
[1874.94 → 1875.24] uh,
[1875.26 → 1875.52] I'm,
[1875.56 → 1875.88] I'm,
[1875.96 → 1876.14] I,
[1876.38 → 1878.64] it would be very off-brand
[1878.64 → 1879.22] for me
[1879.22 → 1880.52] to say,
[1880.74 → 1882.00] well then,
[1882.10 → 1882.32] hmm,
[1882.46 → 1883.16] I don't know,
[1883.16 → 1883.86] the fan could,
[1883.94 → 1884.14] uh,
[1884.80 → 1885.58] the fan could make
[1885.58 → 1886.64] a little bit of extra noise
[1886.64 → 1887.52] so you should probably
[1887.52 → 1888.54] buy a brand-new card.
[1889.02 → 1889.24] Yeah.
[1889.44 → 1889.82] That's not,
[1889.86 → 1890.18] that's not,
[1890.18 → 1890.74] that's not me.
[1890.82 → 1891.60] That's never going to be me,
[1891.64 → 1891.88] guys.
[1894.82 → 1895.18] Yeah,
[1895.22 → 1895.88] like someone in chat,
[1896.04 → 1897.28] I think I lost the message,
[1897.42 → 1897.70] but,
[1897.76 → 1898.10] uh,
[1898.10 → 1898.78] let's see.
[1898.94 → 1899.84] Red Pigeon in chat
[1899.84 → 1900.02] said,
[1900.10 → 1900.80] my 3080,
[1901.08 → 1902.16] it's a pretty high-end card,
[1902.58 → 1902.74] uh,
[1902.74 → 1904.02] but my 3080 still runs
[1904.02 → 1905.16] everything I play perfectly.
[1905.28 → 1906.52] The only game it struggles in
[1906.52 → 1907.54] at high settings
[1907.54 → 1908.72] is Cyberpunk,
[1908.72 → 1910.44] which is like
[1910.44 → 1911.38] an extremely,
[1911.66 → 1913.08] insanely hard game to run,
[1913.14 → 1914.12] especially in high settings.
[1914.24 → 1915.24] It's also one game.
[1915.52 → 1915.72] Yeah.
[1915.88 → 1916.56] So play it
[1916.56 → 1917.30] and then,
[1918.14 → 1919.06] just run it at like medium.
[1919.28 → 1920.06] And then run it at medium.
[1920.50 → 1920.70] Yes,
[1920.76 → 1921.66] it actually still looks
[1921.66 → 1922.68] perfect at medium.
[1922.84 → 1923.04] Yeah.
[1923.54 → 1923.98] Um,
[1925.26 → 1927.18] I feel like we do end up,
[1927.64 → 1929.64] I feel like we do end up
[1929.64 → 1930.72] getting kind of
[1930.72 → 1932.56] taunted
[1932.56 → 1934.98] into spending more
[1934.98 → 1936.30] on a GPU sometimes
[1936.30 → 1937.64] by just the existence
[1937.64 → 1939.96] of higher detail sliders.
[1940.62 → 1940.80] Uh,
[1940.82 → 1941.20] I do,
[1941.30 → 1942.06] I do wonder
[1942.06 → 1943.42] as much as a
[1943.42 → 1944.08] as a geek,
[1944.40 → 1945.34] I love
[1945.34 → 1946.62] that CD Project Red
[1946.62 → 1947.56] just keeps adding
[1947.56 → 1948.68] new technology
[1948.68 → 1949.26] to Cyberpunk.
[1949.54 → 1950.34] You don't have to turn it on.
[1950.36 → 1951.16] It's the coolest thing ever.
[1951.20 → 1951.36] I mean,
[1951.38 → 1951.80] it's the new,
[1951.86 → 1952.88] it's the new crisis.
[1953.18 → 1953.26] They,
[1953.38 → 1954.80] they literally add
[1954.80 → 1957.52] settings
[1957.52 → 1958.46] that they know
[1958.46 → 1959.64] that no modern hardware
[1959.64 → 1961.18] can possibly push
[1961.18 → 1961.54] at a
[1961.54 → 1962.66] at a reasonable frame rate.
[1963.02 → 1963.62] But I,
[1963.62 → 1963.98] I do,
[1964.12 → 1964.88] I do wonder
[1964.88 → 1965.82] if that ends up
[1965.82 → 1966.46] almost having
[1966.46 → 1967.62] like a negative effect
[1967.62 → 1968.16] on people.
[1968.34 → 1969.40] Like the existence
[1969.40 → 1970.20] of that slider
[1970.20 → 1971.16] makes them feel bad
[1971.16 → 1971.98] about their GPU
[1971.98 → 1972.86] when if they just
[1972.86 → 1974.58] set it to
[1974.58 → 1975.52] a lower setting
[1975.52 → 1976.28] and then just
[1976.28 → 1977.32] never looked at it
[1977.32 → 1977.66] at,
[1977.70 → 1977.94] you know,
[1978.12 → 1979.20] Ray Trace Ultra
[1979.20 → 1981.24] overkill,
[1981.42 → 1981.72] you know,
[1981.78 → 1983.60] preset or whatever.
[1985.64 → 1986.28] They would just
[1986.28 → 1986.96] enjoy the game
[1986.96 → 1987.22] and,
[1987.26 → 1987.50] and,
[1987.50 → 1988.52] and be happy with it.
[1989.02 → 1989.44] Yeah.
[1989.56 → 1989.72] I mean,
[1989.72 → 1990.86] some of the biggest games
[1990.86 → 1991.28] this year,
[1991.34 → 1991.80] Pal World.
[1992.20 → 1993.14] You don't need a freaking
[1993.14 → 1993.94] powerful GPU
[1993.94 → 1994.80] to play Pal World.
[1994.88 → 1995.20] No,
[1996.06 → 1996.66] not at all.
[1997.66 → 1998.14] Baldur's Gate 3
[1998.14 → 1998.84] is going to run fine.
[1999.16 → 1999.46] Oh yeah.
[2001.02 → 2001.46] I,
[2001.56 → 2001.88] I,
[2002.10 → 2004.12] for a period of time
[2004.12 → 2005.14] ran Baldur's Gate 3
[2005.14 → 2005.88] on a
[2005.88 → 2006.94] uh,
[2008.42 → 2008.94] Titan RTX,
[2009.62 → 2010.68] which is 2080
[2010.68 → 2011.00] equivalent,
[2011.12 → 2011.38] I think,
[2011.50 → 2011.74] roughly.
[2012.10 → 2013.14] No problem whatsoever.
[2013.34 → 2013.84] 2080 Ti.
[2014.08 → 2014.58] 2080 Ti?
[2014.66 → 2014.78] Okay.
[2014.78 → 2014.84] Yeah,
[2014.84 → 2016.10] 2080 was a lot
[2016.10 → 2017.42] lower than 2080 Ti
[2017.42 → 2018.26] because NVIDIA's
[2018.26 → 2018.72] naming scheme
[2018.72 → 2019.24] means nothing.
[2019.48 → 2020.24] It's ridiculous.
[2020.24 → 2020.54] Yeah.
[2020.98 → 2021.42] Um,
[2021.56 → 2021.80] but,
[2021.92 → 2022.32] but still,
[2022.40 → 2022.64] that's,
[2022.70 → 2023.28] that's multiple
[2023.28 → 2024.20] generations back
[2024.20 → 2025.42] and,
[2025.62 → 2026.06] uh,
[2026.06 → 2026.30] I,
[2026.30 → 2026.90] I don't think
[2026.90 → 2027.32] I noticed
[2027.32 → 2028.04] a huge difference
[2028.04 → 2028.74] when I put in
[2028.74 → 2029.38] one of the newer,
[2029.56 → 2030.34] more powerful cards.
[2030.44 → 2030.78] It's just like,
[2030.82 → 2031.26] whatever.
[2031.62 → 2032.46] So that's two
[2032.46 → 2033.32] of the biggest games
[2033.32 → 2033.80] in the last
[2033.80 → 2034.96] quite a while.
[2035.70 → 2036.36] Neither of which
[2036.36 → 2036.92] would have an issue
[2036.92 → 2038.40] with a 2000 series card,
[2038.62 → 2039.42] let alone a three
[2039.42 → 2039.94] or four.
[2039.94 → 2042.08] You can run
[2042.08 → 2042.66] Lethal Company
[2042.66 → 2043.10] on Potato,
[2043.28 → 2044.04] that's another game
[2044.04 → 2044.90] that blew up recently.
[2045.08 → 2045.26] Yep.
[2045.62 → 2046.76] Speaking of running
[2046.76 → 2047.58] games on a potato,
[2047.92 → 2049.14] we finally did it.
[2049.90 → 2051.28] Potato powered computer?
[2052.66 → 2053.10] No.
[2053.38 → 2053.72] Okay,
[2053.92 → 2054.16] good.
[2054.88 → 2055.90] Run for like a second
[2055.90 → 2057.00] if you got it
[2057.00 → 2057.72] to turn on at all.
[2058.56 → 2059.46] You probably could.
[2060.02 → 2060.94] I have no idea.
[2061.60 → 2062.98] The potato computer.
[2063.60 → 2063.88] What?
[2065.80 → 2066.76] It's water cooled.
[2067.78 → 2068.06] What?
[2068.20 → 2069.24] Because of course it is.
[2069.94 → 2073.22] You're not going
[2073.22 → 2073.58] to explain,
[2073.66 → 2073.92] are you?
[2074.36 → 2075.60] It's a potato computer.
[2075.74 → 2076.12] There's nothing
[2076.12 → 2076.66] to explain.
[2077.56 → 2078.84] We built a computer
[2078.84 → 2079.42] in a potato.
[2080.34 → 2081.28] In a potato?
[2083.12 → 2084.30] Is this like a
[2084.30 → 2086.40] special variety
[2086.40 → 2086.86] of potato
[2086.86 → 2087.84] that's extremely large?
[2088.00 → 2088.20] No.
[2088.50 → 2088.76] Oh.
[2089.28 → 2090.18] It's a russet potato.
[2093.18 → 2093.66] See,
[2093.72 → 2094.12] that's probably
[2094.12 → 2095.16] going to get more views
[2095.16 → 2096.22] than the 4080
[2096.22 → 2097.16] Super Refresh.
[2097.30 → 2097.42] Oh,
[2097.44 → 2097.88] it'll get way more.
[2098.08 → 2098.34] Yeah.
[2098.62 → 2099.80] And it's also way cooler
[2099.80 → 2100.40] because...
[2100.40 → 2100.86] It's interesting.
[2101.04 → 2101.40] Honestly,
[2101.66 → 2102.66] it's technology
[2102.66 → 2103.32] that's actually
[2103.32 → 2104.22] moving really fast
[2104.22 → 2104.64] right now.
[2105.04 → 2105.40] Like we,
[2105.76 → 2106.36] because what we're
[2106.36 → 2107.28] highlighting is
[2107.28 → 2108.76] AMD's Apus
[2108.76 → 2109.36] and how...
[2109.36 → 2109.52] Oh,
[2109.58 → 2109.74] okay.
[2109.84 → 2110.56] And so there's
[2110.56 → 2111.18] this really cool
[2111.18 → 2111.80] Minis Forum
[2111.80 → 2113.28] system that we use
[2113.28 → 2113.88] to,
[2114.08 → 2114.82] that we dismantle
[2114.82 → 2115.44] in order to
[2115.44 → 2116.60] make our potato PC
[2116.60 → 2117.66] that is
[2117.66 → 2120.42] shockingly small.
[2120.42 → 2121.84] because I haven't
[2121.84 → 2122.56] seen anyone
[2122.56 → 2123.42] integrate these
[2123.42 → 2123.98] processors,
[2124.26 → 2125.06] these really
[2125.06 → 2126.10] powerful Apus
[2126.10 → 2126.66] that AMD's
[2126.66 → 2127.16] been coming out
[2127.16 → 2127.54] with over the
[2127.54 → 2128.36] last year or so
[2128.36 → 2129.34] in anything other
[2129.34 → 2129.96] than a handheld
[2129.96 → 2130.86] gaming PC
[2130.86 → 2131.88] or a laptop
[2131.88 → 2133.88] where you can
[2133.88 → 2134.36] only make them
[2134.36 → 2134.76] so small
[2134.76 → 2135.16] because they have
[2135.16 → 2135.82] to have screens
[2135.82 → 2136.44] and batteries
[2136.44 → 2137.92] and things
[2137.92 → 2138.50] that you don't
[2138.50 → 2139.90] need in a
[2139.90 → 2140.54] standalone PC.
[2140.54 → 2141.14] So things like
[2141.14 → 2141.62] this big.
[2142.90 → 2143.70] It's freaking
[2143.70 → 2144.14] tiny.
[2144.22 → 2144.70] And we were like,
[2144.70 → 2146.30] can we finally
[2146.30 → 2146.70] do it?
[2147.68 → 2148.04] Anyway,
[2148.16 → 2148.62] a lot of
[2148.62 → 2149.56] shenanigans ensues
[2149.56 → 2150.16] because it's
[2150.16 → 2150.84] me and David
[2150.84 → 2152.28] who we seem
[2152.28 → 2152.92] to have developed
[2152.92 → 2153.66] a bit of a vibe
[2153.66 → 2154.94] for the projects
[2154.94 → 2155.64] that we work on
[2155.64 → 2156.02] together,
[2156.26 → 2157.38] but you guys
[2157.38 → 2157.68] aren't going to
[2157.68 → 2158.02] want to miss
[2158.02 → 2158.34] that one.
[2158.38 → 2158.78] It's a lot of
[2158.78 → 2159.02] fun.
[2159.66 → 2159.98] I just want to
[2159.98 → 2160.38] jump to this
[2160.38 → 2161.30] to talk about
[2161.30 → 2161.86] your previous
[2161.86 → 2162.28] point.
[2162.38 → 2162.50] Oh,
[2162.54 → 2162.70] sure.
[2163.42 → 2164.14] So there's an
[2164.14 → 2165.46] Xbox Series X.
[2165.54 → 2165.62] Oh,
[2165.64 → 2166.10] that's Canadian
[2166.10 → 2166.68] pricing though.
[2167.04 → 2167.18] Yeah,
[2167.22 → 2167.38] yeah.
[2167.62 → 2167.84] Oh,
[2167.90 → 2168.16] I see.
[2168.58 → 2169.70] My point though
[2169.70 → 2170.54] is that it
[2170.54 → 2171.86] comes with 24
[2171.86 → 2172.84] months of Game
[2172.84 → 2173.44] Pass Ultimate.
[2174.24 → 2174.44] Oh,
[2174.50 → 2174.68] wow.
[2174.70 → 2177.36] So for
[2177.36 → 2178.80] half the
[2178.80 → 2180.40] price of
[2180.40 → 2182.24] a 4080
[2182.24 → 2182.72] Super,
[2183.14 → 2184.68] you can have
[2184.68 → 2186.42] this and
[2186.42 → 2189.42] two years
[2189.42 → 2190.02] of playing.
[2190.10 → 2190.32] Does it
[2190.32 → 2190.52] come with
[2190.52 → 2191.16] EA Play 2?
[2191.66 → 2191.88] Yeah,
[2191.90 → 2192.24] it comes with
[2192.24 → 2192.58] both.
[2193.06 → 2193.32] Yeah.
[2194.26 → 2194.74] Hilarious.
[2197.54 → 2197.98] So,
[2198.40 → 2199.54] and like
[2199.54 → 2199.82] this is
[2199.82 → 2200.10] Canadian
[2200.10 → 2200.38] dollars,
[2200.46 → 2200.68] so when
[2200.68 → 2201.20] you look
[2201.20 → 2201.78] at 4080
[2201.78 → 2202.10] Super
[2202.10 → 2202.60] in Canadian
[2202.60 → 2202.92] dollars,
[2203.12 → 2203.56] there is
[2203.56 → 2204.28] easily enough
[2204.28 → 2204.64] money to
[2204.64 → 2204.86] get a
[2204.86 → 2205.38] very solid
[2205.38 → 2205.90] TV on
[2205.90 → 2206.20] top of
[2206.20 → 2206.40] this.
[2206.50 → 2206.78] I talked
[2206.78 → 2207.18] to NVIDIA
[2207.18 → 2207.58] about this
[2207.58 → 2208.12] at CES.
[2208.22 → 2208.40] I was
[2208.40 → 2209.02] basically like,
[2209.08 → 2209.48] look guys,
[2209.80 → 2210.54] I get it.
[2210.92 → 2211.16] You know,
[2211.28 → 2211.68] silicon's
[2211.68 → 2212.04] expensive.
[2212.24 → 2212.80] It's not like
[2212.80 → 2213.78] you set
[2213.78 → 2214.70] TSMC's pricing.
[2214.84 → 2215.16] I understand
[2215.16 → 2215.50] that.
[2215.50 → 2218.46] And I also
[2218.46 → 2219.04] understand you
[2219.04 → 2220.56] have to
[2220.56 → 2222.18] maintain your
[2222.18 → 2222.76] margins in
[2222.76 → 2223.00] order to
[2223.00 → 2223.32] make sure
[2223.32 → 2223.78] that stock
[2223.78 → 2224.22] price go
[2224.22 → 2224.54] up and
[2224.54 → 2224.82] all those
[2224.82 → 2225.30] things that
[2225.30 → 2226.14] you have
[2226.14 → 2226.46] to do,
[2226.52 → 2226.86] I guess,
[2226.92 → 2228.50] in order to
[2228.50 → 2229.18] maintain your
[2229.18 → 2229.80] health and
[2229.80 → 2230.78] keep investing
[2230.78 → 2231.64] in the future
[2231.64 → 2232.18] of technology
[2232.18 → 2232.56] and all that
[2232.56 → 2232.80] stuff.
[2232.90 → 2233.20] And they
[2233.20 → 2233.68] do that
[2233.68 → 2233.90] stuff.
[2234.02 → 2234.58] They build
[2234.58 → 2235.64] really cool
[2235.64 → 2236.18] technology.
[2236.30 → 2236.56] I'll never
[2236.56 → 2236.90] hate on
[2236.90 → 2237.40] NVIDIA for
[2237.40 → 2237.84] their tech.
[2237.92 → 2238.02] It's
[2238.02 → 2238.42] amazing.
[2238.42 → 2240.90] But guys,
[2241.46 → 2241.96] you have
[2241.96 → 2243.40] to kind
[2243.40 → 2244.10] of understand
[2244.10 → 2245.04] what's going
[2245.04 → 2245.68] on here
[2245.68 → 2246.34] right now.
[2246.46 → 2247.14] You are
[2247.14 → 2248.00] alienating
[2248.00 → 2249.08] your
[2249.08 → 2250.42] evangelical
[2250.42 → 2251.34] users.
[2252.10 → 2252.52] You are
[2252.52 → 2253.62] even worse
[2253.62 → 2254.38] than alienating.
[2254.60 → 2254.86] You are
[2254.86 → 2256.06] creating a
[2256.06 → 2256.66] culture of
[2256.66 → 2258.30] apathy in
[2258.30 → 2259.28] the gaming
[2259.28 → 2260.02] enthusiast
[2260.02 → 2260.64] community.
[2261.12 → 2262.18] They're just
[2262.18 → 2263.18] bored.
[2264.00 → 2264.94] And that
[2264.94 → 2265.76] is a huge
[2265.76 → 2266.20] problem.
[2266.38 → 2266.90] Not today,
[2267.00 → 2267.72] not tomorrow,
[2267.72 → 2268.66] but it
[2268.66 → 2269.18] will be.
[2269.34 → 2269.86] That's going
[2269.86 → 2270.50] to be an
[2270.50 → 2270.82] enormous
[2270.82 → 2271.28] problem.
[2271.28 → 2271.84] Unless you
[2271.84 → 2272.96] just don't
[2272.96 → 2273.22] care.
[2273.62 → 2274.06] And if you
[2274.06 → 2274.90] just don't
[2274.90 → 2275.22] care,
[2275.32 → 2276.24] then fine.
[2277.82 → 2278.56] But, you
[2278.56 → 2278.78] know if
[2278.78 → 2279.22] there's anything
[2279.22 → 2279.76] that you can
[2279.76 → 2280.42] do to convey
[2280.42 → 2280.90] this to the
[2280.90 → 2281.46] higher-ups,
[2281.64 → 2282.10] that it
[2282.10 → 2282.62] would be
[2282.62 → 2284.22] maybe prudent
[2284.22 → 2284.96] at some
[2284.96 → 2286.22] point to
[2286.22 → 2288.06] do something
[2288.06 → 2288.66] exciting,
[2289.70 → 2292.28] I think you
[2292.28 → 2292.86] should consider
[2292.86 → 2293.10] it.
[2294.92 → 2295.56] And it's
[2295.56 → 2295.84] not like
[2295.84 → 2296.06] I'm sure
[2296.06 → 2296.44] that went
[2296.44 → 2296.82] nowhere,
[2296.96 → 2297.32] unfortunately.
[2297.32 → 2297.68] Oh, yeah,
[2297.70 → 2297.96] I know.
[2298.34 → 2298.90] But I
[2298.90 → 2299.12] mean, I
[2299.12 → 2299.32] had to
[2299.32 → 2299.76] say it.
[2299.96 → 2300.22] Sure.
[2300.32 → 2300.56] What am I
[2300.56 → 2300.72] going to
[2300.72 → 2300.86] do?
[2300.92 → 2301.38] Not say
[2301.38 → 2301.54] it?
[2301.62 → 2302.70] I should
[2302.70 → 2303.20] say it.
[2303.46 → 2303.54] And
[2303.54 → 2303.96] NVIDIA
[2303.96 → 2305.24] knows how
[2305.24 → 2305.50] to do
[2305.50 → 2305.88] exciting.
[2306.70 → 2307.80] 8800 GT.
[2308.20 → 2308.80] When NVIDIA
[2308.80 → 2310.12] decides to
[2310.12 → 2310.82] be exciting,
[2311.12 → 2311.48] they can
[2311.48 → 2311.96] do it.
[2313.54 → 2314.22] 30 series
[2314.22 → 2314.60] launch.
[2315.30 → 2315.86] That was
[2315.86 → 2316.52] exciting.
[2318.08 → 2318.58] And when
[2318.58 → 2319.10] they decide
[2319.10 → 2320.12] not to be
[2320.12 → 2320.50] exciting,
[2320.64 → 2320.94] well, they
[2320.94 → 2321.12] know how
[2321.12 → 2321.30] to do
[2321.30 → 2321.62] that, too.
[2323.50 → 2323.94] No, no.
[2323.94 → 2324.24] When I
[2324.24 → 2325.00] say exciting,
[2325.10 → 2325.52] guys, I
[2325.52 → 2325.90] don't just
[2325.90 → 2327.12] mean worthy
[2327.12 → 2327.76] of purchase
[2327.76 → 2328.42] at all.
[2328.80 → 2329.28] I mean
[2329.28 → 2329.82] exciting.
[2330.22 → 2331.30] 8800 GT
[2331.30 → 2331.86] was a
[2331.86 → 2332.86] moment of
[2332.86 → 2333.28] gaming
[2333.28 → 2334.32] excitement.
[2334.32 → 2334.96] All of a
[2334.96 → 2335.42] sudden, for
[2335.42 → 2336.20] literally half
[2336.20 → 2336.72] the price,
[2336.86 → 2337.78] with some
[2337.78 → 2338.34] compromises,
[2338.46 → 2339.10] it had less
[2339.10 → 2340.34] VRAM, but
[2340.34 → 2341.28] you could
[2341.28 → 2343.32] get performance
[2343.32 → 2343.82] that was
[2343.82 → 2345.32] close to
[2345.32 → 2345.84] what the
[2345.84 → 2346.72] day prior
[2346.72 → 2347.30] would have
[2347.30 → 2347.62] cost you
[2347.62 → 2348.08] $500.
[2348.08 → 2350.44] I have
[2350.44 → 2350.72] to make
[2350.72 → 2350.90] some
[2350.90 → 2351.60] clarifications.
[2352.00 → 2352.08] Sure.
[2352.56 → 2353.00] Apparently,
[2353.14 → 2353.60] the Xbox
[2353.60 → 2354.66] Game Pass
[2354.66 → 2355.10] Ultimate
[2355.10 → 2355.76] All Access
[2355.76 → 2356.30] something or
[2356.30 → 2356.52] other,
[2356.60 → 2356.96] whatever I
[2356.96 → 2357.36] called it,
[2357.80 → 2358.82] is some
[2358.82 → 2359.32] form of
[2359.32 → 2359.76] financing
[2359.76 → 2360.62] option thing.
[2361.52 → 2361.76] Oh, is
[2361.76 → 2362.14] that why?
[2362.22 → 2362.68] So you pay
[2362.68 → 2363.10] for it over
[2363.10 → 2363.90] 24 months,
[2364.10 → 2364.96] and then it
[2364.96 → 2365.40] comes with
[2365.40 → 2365.80] Game Pass
[2365.80 → 2366.10] Ultimate.
[2366.68 → 2367.66] So you pay
[2367.66 → 2368.08] for the
[2368.08 → 2369.36] console and
[2369.36 → 2369.80] Game Pass
[2369.80 → 2370.58] Ultimate as
[2370.58 → 2371.10] a subscription
[2371.10 → 2371.70] for 24
[2371.70 → 2372.04] months.
[2372.58 → 2373.22] Oh, okay.
[2373.34 → 2373.76] But then I
[2373.76 → 2374.12] think you own
[2374.12 → 2374.60] the console at
[2374.60 → 2374.88] the end,
[2375.38 → 2375.90] or something.
[2376.02 → 2376.46] I don't know.
[2376.70 → 2376.94] Okay.
[2377.22 → 2377.72] Well, however
[2377.72 → 2378.26] it works,
[2378.44 → 2378.92] you were so
[2378.92 → 2379.38] far below
[2379.38 → 2379.90] the cost of
[2379.90 → 2380.28] the GPU
[2380.28 → 2380.82] anyway that
[2380.82 → 2381.28] I still think
[2381.28 → 2381.60] we're in the
[2381.60 → 2381.78] clear.
[2382.18 → 2382.74] Yeah, because
[2382.74 → 2383.38] I found this
[2383.38 → 2383.76] anyway.
[2384.16 → 2384.64] That's US
[2384.64 → 2384.98] dollars.
[2385.58 → 2385.82] Yeah.
[2386.16 → 2386.98] So there you go.
[2386.98 → 2387.84] Oh, wow,
[2387.94 → 2388.26] they're under
[2388.26 → 2389.02] $500 now.
[2389.16 → 2389.66] Wow, Microsoft
[2389.66 → 2390.38] must really need
[2390.38 → 2390.76] to move some
[2390.76 → 2391.08] units.
[2391.44 → 2391.84] I don't think
[2391.84 → 2392.68] Sony's discounted
[2392.68 → 2393.08] PS5.
[2393.14 → 2393.50] If anything,
[2393.58 → 2394.08] they've increased
[2394.08 → 2394.56] the price.
[2395.80 → 2396.92] It's freaking
[2396.92 → 2397.56] February.
[2398.12 → 2398.36] Yeah.
[2398.60 → 2399.04] What?
[2399.60 → 2400.04] Interesting.
[2400.04 → 2400.26] Apparently it's
[2400.26 → 2401.20] 0% interest,
[2401.42 → 2402.06] that 24-month
[2402.06 → 2402.68] payment thing.
[2402.76 → 2403.02] Oh, okay.
[2403.42 → 2404.06] I don't know.
[2404.10 → 2404.36] I don't know
[2404.36 → 2404.82] anything about it.
[2404.84 → 2405.38] I'm not suggesting
[2405.38 → 2406.10] finance models.
[2406.16 → 2406.56] I just found
[2406.56 → 2406.88] the one that
[2406.88 → 2407.56] isn't financing
[2407.56 → 2408.56] is US dollars
[2408.56 → 2409.00] because that's
[2409.00 → 2409.36] the main thing
[2409.36 → 2409.62] we're having
[2409.62 → 2410.16] the conversation
[2410.16 → 2411.60] in, and it's
[2411.60 → 2412.38] less than 500
[2412.38 → 2412.78] bucks.
[2412.98 → 2413.94] So the point
[2413.94 → 2414.54] still completely
[2414.54 → 2414.90] stands.
[2416.90 → 2417.48] Here's our
[2417.48 → 2418.32] discussion topic.
[2420.20 → 2421.44] You are now,
[2422.38 → 2423.42] let's say,
[2423.48 → 2424.58] 15-year-old Luke.
[2426.54 → 2427.02] Sick.
[2427.32 → 2427.98] Yeah, I know.
[2429.02 → 2429.54] You know,
[2429.58 → 2430.12] you're stronger.
[2430.48 → 2431.06] I'm happy.
[2431.38 → 2431.70] Smarter,
[2431.88 → 2432.20] faster.
[2432.90 → 2433.44] Things are
[2433.44 → 2434.18] improving in
[2434.18 → 2434.50] general.
[2436.78 → 2437.60] I'm not as
[2437.60 → 2437.98] broken.
[2438.54 → 2439.02] Do you need
[2439.02 → 2439.34] to talk?
[2439.66 → 2440.02] Are you okay?
[2440.18 → 2440.88] Things are great.
[2441.92 → 2442.56] Okay, so you're
[2442.56 → 2443.44] 15-year-old Luke.
[2443.54 → 2443.74] Yeah.
[2444.88 → 2446.48] The one thing
[2446.48 → 2448.62] that's worse
[2448.62 → 2449.54] is that you
[2449.54 → 2450.10] don't have any
[2450.10 → 2450.38] money.
[2451.78 → 2453.52] I was very
[2453.52 → 2453.88] broke.
[2453.96 → 2454.60] Everything else
[2454.60 → 2455.08] was better,
[2455.26 → 2456.60] but you don't
[2456.60 → 2457.28] have any money.
[2457.28 → 2459.92] Do you take
[2459.92 → 2460.72] up PC gaming
[2460.72 → 2461.52] right now?
[2462.58 → 2463.32] Probably not.
[2463.78 → 2464.08] Or do you
[2464.08 → 2464.80] just play on
[2464.80 → 2464.94] console?
[2464.94 → 2465.22] Because back then
[2465.22 → 2466.58] I didn't really
[2466.58 → 2466.94] care.
[2467.10 → 2467.54] I cared.
[2468.08 → 2468.34] I mean,
[2468.36 → 2468.86] this is still
[2468.86 → 2469.64] honestly kind
[2469.64 → 2470.12] of true.
[2470.80 → 2471.98] Just PCs can
[2471.98 → 2472.92] play so much
[2472.92 → 2473.48] more now.
[2474.36 → 2475.04] That's true.
[2475.14 → 2475.72] But back then
[2475.72 → 2476.54] I was in it
[2476.54 → 2477.42] for the games
[2477.42 → 2477.88] for the most
[2477.88 → 2478.14] part.
[2478.14 → 2478.94] And I got
[2478.94 → 2479.50] interested in
[2479.50 → 2480.28] computers mostly
[2480.28 → 2481.60] because I
[2481.60 → 2482.40] needed to learn
[2482.40 → 2483.44] how to work
[2483.44 → 2484.00] with them and
[2484.00 → 2484.76] fix them and
[2484.76 → 2486.18] keep them going
[2486.18 → 2486.86] to be able to
[2486.86 → 2487.54] play games.
[2488.02 → 2488.86] And I needed
[2488.86 → 2489.52] to learn basic
[2489.52 → 2490.62] networking because
[2490.62 → 2491.20] my friend and
[2491.20 → 2491.60] I wanted to
[2491.60 → 2492.64] play Diablo
[2492.64 → 2493.18] on LAN.
[2493.50 → 2494.00] And then I
[2494.00 → 2494.60] needed to learn
[2494.60 → 2496.16] still basic but
[2496.16 → 2497.00] slightly less basic
[2497.00 → 2497.64] networking because
[2497.64 → 2498.00] we wanted to
[2498.00 → 2498.66] have LAN's of
[2498.66 → 2499.56] a bunch of
[2499.56 → 2500.06] computers and
[2500.06 → 2500.90] multiple Boxes
[2500.90 → 2501.30] all at the same
[2501.30 → 2501.68] time.
[2501.80 → 2502.48] And I wanted to
[2502.48 → 2502.84] be able to host
[2502.84 → 2503.58] servers for things
[2503.58 → 2503.82] and all this
[2503.82 → 2504.20] kind of stuff.
[2504.74 → 2505.60] That was all
[2505.60 → 2506.38] largely because of
[2506.38 → 2506.76] games.
[2506.98 → 2507.46] And that's what
[2507.46 → 2508.22] drove my passion
[2508.22 → 2508.94] for technology.
[2509.46 → 2510.50] But we pretty
[2510.50 → 2511.38] much always had
[2511.38 → 2512.06] consoles at the
[2512.06 → 2512.58] same time.
[2512.74 → 2513.10] And I would
[2513.10 → 2513.76] always pretty
[2513.76 → 2514.72] much play both.
[2516.18 → 2517.44] Because I talk
[2517.44 → 2517.70] about how
[2517.70 → 2518.28] Borrowing is my
[2518.28 → 2518.70] favourite game of
[2518.70 → 2519.36] all time all the
[2519.36 → 2519.56] time.
[2519.76 → 2520.34] I didn't play it
[2520.34 → 2520.68] on PC.
[2521.42 → 2522.02] I had it on
[2522.02 → 2522.36] Xbox.
[2523.30 → 2524.08] I played the
[2524.08 → 2525.10] crap out of the
[2525.10 → 2526.12] Halo games not
[2526.12 → 2526.66] on PC.
[2526.92 → 2527.74] I played them on
[2527.74 → 2528.04] Xbox.
[2529.22 → 2530.94] Some of my
[2530.94 → 2531.48] favourite memories
[2531.48 → 2532.10] of playing games
[2532.10 → 2532.74] with my dad were
[2532.74 → 2533.34] on Super
[2533.34 → 2533.98] Nintendo and
[2533.98 → 2534.54] N64.
[2535.46 → 2536.12] And he played
[2536.12 → 2537.00] Warcraft 2 on
[2537.00 → 2537.80] PlayStation 1.
[2538.12 → 2538.98] Not on PC.
[2539.12 → 2539.44] No, I'm just
[2539.44 → 2539.66] kidding.
[2539.82 → 2540.38] Please don't do
[2540.38 → 2540.52] that.
[2541.32 → 2542.82] We had PCs as
[2542.82 → 2543.42] well, but it was
[2543.42 → 2544.72] about what game I
[2544.72 → 2545.20] felt like playing
[2545.20 → 2545.60] at the time.
[2545.60 → 2546.92] And if PCs were
[2546.92 → 2547.82] this hard to get
[2547.82 → 2551.66] into, yeah, I
[2551.66 → 2552.70] mean we didn't
[2552.70 → 2553.24] have a ton of
[2553.24 → 2553.44] money.
[2553.62 → 2554.18] It would have
[2554.18 → 2554.96] come down to a
[2554.96 → 2556.00] costing issue and
[2556.00 → 2556.56] would have stuck
[2556.56 → 2557.02] with consoles.
[2557.80 → 2558.92] Like just is what
[2558.92 → 2559.22] it is.
[2559.70 → 2560.40] And I probably
[2560.40 → 2560.84] still would have
[2560.84 → 2561.44] gotten interested in
[2561.44 → 2562.66] technology because I
[2562.66 → 2563.08] still would have
[2563.08 → 2563.98] been having LAN's.
[2564.38 → 2564.94] Still would have
[2564.94 → 2565.52] had to network
[2565.52 → 2566.06] these consoles
[2566.06 → 2566.80] together and stuff
[2566.80 → 2567.72] but like, yeah.
[2569.10 → 2569.50] Yeah.
[2570.16 → 2570.94] Yeah, I mean
[2570.94 → 2572.64] looking back, when I
[2572.64 → 2573.56] got into computer
[2573.56 → 2575.28] games, I got into
[2575.28 → 2577.06] games that could
[2577.06 → 2577.88] run on a computer.
[2579.08 → 2580.30] I wasn't, we
[2580.30 → 2581.34] didn't have a
[2581.34 → 2581.98] fancy computer.
[2582.10 → 2582.62] I don't think we
[2582.62 → 2583.78] had a dedicated
[2583.78 → 2585.26] graphics card until
[2585.26 → 2586.24] I needed to play
[2586.24 → 2587.40] Civilization 2 Test
[2587.40 → 2589.04] of Time and in
[2589.04 → 2589.86] order for the
[2589.86 → 2590.94] full motion video
[2590.94 → 2593.26] diplomats and
[2593.26 → 2595.28] stuff or emissaries
[2595.28 → 2596.64] to show up, you
[2596.64 → 2598.64] had to have, you
[2598.64 → 2600.00] had to support some
[2600.00 → 2600.72] level of Direct
[2600.72 → 2601.06] 3D.
[2601.46 → 2602.32] I forget what it
[2602.32 → 2603.58] was but I
[2603.58 → 2605.16] basically went to
[2605.16 → 2606.74] Bargain Bytes, you
[2606.74 → 2607.58] know, some hole in
[2607.58 → 2608.30] the wall computer
[2608.30 → 2609.58] shop in Mission of
[2609.58 → 2610.94] all places and I
[2610.94 → 2612.44] was like, okay, this
[2612.44 → 2612.92] is the minimum
[2612.92 → 2613.70] requirement on the
[2613.70 → 2614.00] box.
[2614.08 → 2614.54] I'm pretty sure I
[2614.54 → 2615.12] physically brought
[2615.12 → 2615.64] the box.
[2616.10 → 2616.60] I need something.
[2616.60 → 2617.24] I used to do that
[2617.24 → 2617.40] too.
[2617.46 → 2618.06] I need something
[2618.06 → 2620.26] that this and
[2620.26 → 2621.78] until then we
[2621.78 → 2622.50] didn't even have a
[2622.50 → 2623.36] dedicated graphics
[2623.36 → 2624.00] card so everything
[2624.00 → 2624.64] was like CPU
[2624.64 → 2625.06] accelerated.
[2625.16 → 2626.40] My point isn't
[2626.40 → 2629.02] that, you know, we
[2629.02 → 2629.96] couldn't have bought a
[2629.96 → 2631.02] GPU instead of a
[2631.02 → 2631.90] console or something
[2631.90 → 2632.36] like that.
[2632.42 → 2634.66] My point is that it
[2634.66 → 2636.10] was just there.
[2636.26 → 2637.52] I fell into it.
[2637.84 → 2638.92] We are asking for
[2638.92 → 2640.32] people to make an
[2640.32 → 2642.38] enormous commitment
[2642.38 → 2643.88] to PC gaming before
[2643.88 → 2644.80] they ever actually
[2644.80 → 2645.74] fire up a game.
[2646.50 → 2646.58] Yeah.
[2646.68 → 2647.68] The fact that the
[2647.68 → 2649.18] 40 Super Refresh
[2649.18 → 2651.08] didn't do anything
[2651.08 → 2652.74] for the sub $500
[2652.74 → 2655.42] range is what people
[2655.42 → 2656.10] should be talking
[2656.10 → 2656.86] about right now.
[2657.04 → 2657.16] Yeah.
[2657.16 → 2659.42] The fact that 4060
[2659.42 → 2661.42] series NVIDIA kind
[2661.42 → 2662.78] of looked at this
[2662.78 → 2663.76] point and went,
[2663.88 → 2665.38] yeah, that seems
[2665.38 → 2665.90] fine.
[2668.40 → 2670.40] Is ridiculous to
[2670.40 → 2670.66] me.
[2672.50 → 2673.70] I'm trying to see on
[2673.70 → 2674.60] New egg right now what
[2674.60 → 2675.98] I can get for less
[2675.98 → 2679.36] than $449 USD.
[2680.20 → 2680.70] Like if I'm an
[2680.70 → 2681.58] American shopper.
[2681.76 → 2682.00] Yeah.
[2682.10 → 2682.94] And so I set my
[2682.94 → 2684.54] filter down here to
[2684.54 → 2686.02] $449 cap.
[2686.02 → 2688.54] So I can get an
[2688.54 → 2690.32] entire Xbox Series X.
[2690.94 → 2691.38] Yeah.
[2692.26 → 2693.18] With the controller
[2693.18 → 2693.86] and stuff.
[2694.62 → 2696.02] Or I can get...
[2697.36 → 2698.46] There isn't really
[2698.46 → 2699.38] like...
[2699.38 → 2700.12] What's this?
[2700.52 → 2701.18] Are those...
[2701.18 → 2701.66] Hold on, hold on.
[2701.72 → 2702.48] Have you filtered for
[2702.48 → 2703.04] things that are in
[2703.04 → 2704.50] stock and shipped by
[2704.50 → 2704.84] New egg?
[2705.56 → 2706.84] Sold by New egg.
[2707.36 → 2707.68] Yeah.
[2707.80 → 2708.06] Okay.
[2708.14 → 2708.68] There we go.
[2708.84 → 2709.52] In stock.
[2710.46 → 2711.18] A lot of pop-ups.
[2711.26 → 2711.46] New egg.
[2712.30 → 2713.36] New egg has turned into
[2713.36 → 2714.64] a gigantic piece of
[2714.64 → 2715.20] shit lately.
[2715.34 → 2716.14] It's very annoying.
[2716.24 → 2718.26] It used to be an
[2718.26 → 2720.26] oasis of easy
[2720.26 → 2723.34] filtering and somewhat
[2723.34 → 2724.36] intuitive shopping.
[2724.72 → 2726.38] And now it's just
[2726.38 → 2727.18] awful.
[2727.18 → 2728.08] Though it's not nearly
[2728.08 → 2728.76] as bad as Amazon.
[2729.26 → 2730.72] Did you see I added a
[2730.72 → 2733.12] segment just called
[2733.12 → 2734.28] like Amazon Sucks or
[2734.28 → 2735.02] something like that.
[2735.72 → 2737.12] I want to do a fun
[2737.12 → 2738.10] little demo for you as
[2738.10 → 2738.58] soon as you're done
[2738.58 → 2738.94] with this.
[2739.02 → 2739.28] Yeah.
[2739.28 → 2739.36] Yeah.
[2740.84 → 2741.24] Yeah.
[2741.24 → 2742.40] I'm trying different
[2742.40 → 2743.20] filter options and
[2743.20 → 2743.32] stuff.
[2743.36 → 2743.94] I just did best
[2743.94 → 2744.42] rating.
[2745.44 → 2745.72] Sure.
[2745.96 → 2746.22] Okay.
[2746.24 → 2746.96] So what do we get?
[2747.64 → 2748.36] 4060 Ti.
[2749.16 → 2749.60] Awesome.
[2751.22 → 2752.50] I think it's probably
[2752.50 → 2754.28] our best one.
[2754.32 → 2756.34] So for $400, is that
[2756.34 → 2757.20] the 8 gig version
[2757.20 → 2757.44] though?
[2759.34 → 2759.78] Nice.
[2760.24 → 2760.48] Yeah.
[2760.94 → 2764.86] So for $400, do you
[2764.86 → 2765.78] know how much 8 gigs
[2765.78 → 2767.18] of GDDR6 costs?
[2770.36 → 2771.44] I'll give you a hint.
[2772.08 → 2772.88] Not a lot.
[2773.48 → 2773.88] Yeah.
[2775.16 → 2775.88] Oh man.
[2778.20 → 2778.56] Yeah.
[2778.80 → 2779.56] 460 Ti.
[2779.94 → 2780.90] I'm not really seeing
[2780.90 → 2782.02] above that.
[2782.12 → 2782.64] I think.
[2783.94 → 2785.50] There's 7600 XTs and
[2785.50 → 2786.10] stuff, but those are
[2786.10 → 2786.74] lower.
[2786.94 → 2787.46] At that point, you're
[2787.46 → 2788.06] saving like almost
[2788.06 → 2788.70] a hundred bucks.
[2790.22 → 2791.10] I'm not saying it's a
[2791.10 → 2791.68] bad deal.
[2791.80 → 2792.38] I'm just trying to
[2792.38 → 2793.68] look for ones that
[2793.68 → 2794.80] are closely priced to
[2794.80 → 2795.26] that Xbox.
[2795.26 → 2796.10] There we go.
[2796.14 → 2796.90] Here's 425.
[2797.06 → 2797.52] What do I get for
[2797.52 → 2798.06] 425?
[2799.02 → 2799.50] 3070.
[2800.00 → 2800.34] Okay.
[2801.60 → 2803.10] So I get, when did
[2803.10 → 2804.20] the 3070 come out?
[2804.22 → 2804.24] Because there's a pretty
[2804.24 → 2805.70] monster deal on this.
[2807.84 → 2809.22] So basically I can buy
[2809.22 → 2811.60] some ancient card from
[2811.60 → 2813.04] October 2020.
[2814.76 → 2815.66] That's right, friends.
[2815.74 → 2818.22] I can buy a three and
[2818.22 → 2819.22] a three and a quarter
[2819.22 → 2821.50] year old GPU that
[2821.50 → 2822.48] launched for, hold on,
[2822.54 → 2824.46] hold on, 3070 launch
[2824.46 → 2825.02] price.
[2825.94 → 2827.08] That launched at
[2827.08 → 2827.70] 499.
[2828.00 → 2828.64] Sorry, what was it
[2828.64 → 2829.46] priced at today?
[2831.26 → 2832.30] 425.
[2836.22 → 2837.18] Oh, man.
[2839.18 → 2840.30] And who do we blame?
[2840.52 → 2841.04] Joe Biden?
[2841.18 → 2842.28] This sucks because we're
[2842.28 → 2847.38] going to go buy used.
[2847.38 → 2849.24] Oh, these are Canadian
[2849.24 → 2849.52] prices.
[2849.66 → 2849.90] That's why.
[2850.02 → 2850.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2850.50 → 2850.84] Never mind.
[2851.04 → 2852.50] So it is a lot cheaper
[2852.50 → 2853.42] to buy used, actually.
[2853.62 → 2854.34] And there was some
[2854.34 → 2855.32] cheaper ones down here.
[2855.72 → 2857.04] So like in this, if you're
[2857.04 → 2858.48] going on New egg to buy a
[2858.48 → 2859.88] 3070, like you're also
[2859.88 → 2860.84] probably doing it wrong.
[2860.84 → 2861.36] Yeah, that's not bad.
[2861.44 → 2863.34] Like that's 230 or so
[2863.34 → 2864.00] US dollars.
[2864.16 → 2865.60] That FE for 300 bucks.
[2865.66 → 2866.58] Oh, no, that's bids.
[2866.66 → 2867.08] That's bids.
[2867.24 → 2868.00] Sorry, that's not a buy it
[2868.00 → 2868.18] now.
[2869.74 → 2871.74] Buy it now, 454.
[2872.36 → 2872.80] Yeah.
[2872.94 → 2874.54] So it's around 350.
[2875.54 → 2876.58] Not that you should do
[2876.58 → 2877.66] the buy it now necessarily.
[2877.94 → 2878.20] Nope.
[2878.66 → 2880.62] And honestly, I've had a
[2880.62 → 2881.56] lot of luck with Facebook
[2881.56 → 2882.78] Marketplace recently just
[2882.78 → 2884.02] because there's no seller
[2884.02 → 2884.32] fees.
[2885.26 → 2887.84] So on eBay, it used to be
[2887.84 → 2888.88] that you could get really
[2888.88 → 2889.46] good deals.
[2889.64 → 2890.84] But eBay seller fees are
[2890.84 → 2891.82] quite high now.
[2892.16 → 2893.26] And I understand why,
[2893.34 → 2894.58] because they offer buyer
[2894.58 → 2896.32] protection, which basically
[2896.32 → 2897.52] as far as I can tell is
[2897.52 → 2898.58] just a nightmare to
[2898.58 → 2899.00] administer.
[2899.52 → 2900.98] So there are services that
[2900.98 → 2902.08] they offer that do add to
[2902.08 → 2903.04] the cost of running the
[2903.04 → 2903.44] platform.
[2903.56 → 2904.14] I get it.
[2904.38 → 2905.66] But the seller fees are
[2905.66 → 2906.98] quite high.
[2906.98 → 2908.30] So if you can meet up
[2908.30 → 2909.14] with someone in person
[2909.14 → 2910.90] and if you can verify
[2910.90 → 2911.86] that the thing actually
[2911.86 → 2914.58] works, then more times
[2914.58 → 2916.84] than not, it's a way to
[2916.84 → 2917.06] go.
[2918.00 → 2919.08] It's a way to go.
[2919.80 → 2920.62] People are like eight
[2920.62 → 2922.30] gigs for 3070 is awful.
[2922.90 → 2923.16] Right.
[2923.24 → 2924.18] But you weren't getting
[2924.18 → 2926.18] anything with more than
[2926.18 → 2927.06] eight gigs at that price
[2927.06 → 2927.42] anyway.
[2927.74 → 2927.94] Yeah.
[2929.28 → 2930.76] So, yeah, it's awful.
[2930.90 → 2932.88] No one's debating that.
[2932.88 → 2933.24] Yeah.
[2933.50 → 2933.78] Yeah.
[2934.60 → 2935.50] Whole point is that it's
[2935.50 → 2935.78] rough.
[2936.06 → 2936.28] Yeah.
[2936.28 → 2938.40] 13% is the seller fees
[2938.40 → 2939.52] on GPUs at the moment,
[2939.60 → 2939.90] apparently.
[2940.16 → 2940.44] Yeah.
[2940.62 → 2942.50] That's freaking a lot.
[2943.88 → 2944.52] Oh, here.
[2944.64 → 2946.36] Can I play this game
[2946.36 → 2946.66] with you?
[2947.50 → 2948.50] Let's play the game
[2948.50 → 2949.54] called I'm going to go
[2949.54 → 2951.34] to Amazon.com and try
[2951.34 → 2953.16] to actually buy
[2953.16 → 2953.64] something.
[2954.84 → 2955.24] Okay.
[2955.68 → 2956.84] So I don't know.
[2957.20 → 2957.68] So here's the thing.
[2957.76 → 2959.40] I don't know if this is
[2959.40 → 2960.30] going to happen the same
[2960.30 → 2961.14] way that it did when I
[2961.14 → 2961.80] was sitting in script
[2961.80 → 2962.38] review with someone
[2962.38 → 2963.14] earlier this week.
[2963.22 → 2963.38] Right.
[2963.50 → 2964.32] Because I don't know.
[2964.32 → 2965.34] It seems to be just like
[2965.34 → 2965.84] RNG.
[2966.28 → 2968.54] Let's see what's going
[2968.54 → 2969.54] to come up when you
[2969.54 → 2970.34] click on something on
[2970.34 → 2971.24] Amazon these days.
[2972.04 → 2973.52] But I was trying to
[2973.52 → 2976.06] figure out what was
[2976.06 → 2977.32] kind of the going rate
[2977.32 → 2978.90] for a 55-inch TV
[2978.90 → 2980.00] because we've got a
[2980.00 → 2980.84] really cool video
[2980.84 → 2981.70] coming on this.
[2982.70 → 2983.60] Flanders Scientific.
[2984.16 → 2984.62] Heard of them?
[2985.00 → 2985.24] No.
[2985.24 → 2985.68] Okay.
[2985.76 → 2986.64] They do instruments.
[2986.78 → 2988.26] They also do mastering
[2988.26 → 2988.72] monitors.
[2988.74 → 2989.20] I was going to say,
[2989.30 → 2990.28] wait, maybe I have.
[2990.50 → 2990.80] Yeah.
[2990.92 → 2991.58] Yes, I have.
[2991.70 → 2992.04] All right.
[2992.28 → 2993.34] So what is it?
[2993.38 → 2993.88] Flanders Scientific
[2993.88 → 2994.38] Instruments?
[2994.56 → 2994.96] FSI?
[2995.20 → 2995.38] I think.
[2995.86 → 2997.08] Flanders Scientific Inc.
[2997.44 → 2997.74] Sorry.
[2997.94 → 2998.10] Okay.
[2998.10 → 2998.36] FSI.
[2998.60 → 2998.94] Whatever.
[2999.54 → 3001.58] Flanders came in and
[3001.58 → 3002.84] was like, hi diddly ho
[3002.84 → 3003.24] guys.
[3004.90 → 3005.92] I hope they actually
[3005.92 → 3006.34] said that.
[3006.46 → 3006.74] They didn't.
[3007.42 → 3009.42] And they brought a
[3009.42 → 3011.18] 55 inch mastering
[3011.18 → 3012.26] monitor that's based on
[3012.26 → 3014.16] Samsung's latest QD
[3014.16 → 3014.92] OLED panel.
[3014.92 → 3015.48] Okay.
[3017.94 → 3018.94] And we were writing an
[3018.94 → 3020.38] intro for this video and
[3020.38 → 3021.34] I was like, okay, you
[3021.34 → 3022.08] know what would be kind
[3022.08 → 3023.42] of fun is to do a bit
[3023.42 → 3025.86] of a like switch, you
[3025.86 → 3027.44] know, switcheroo where
[3027.44 → 3028.94] we start the video in
[3028.94 → 3030.10] kind of like a Randy
[3030.10 → 3030.42] form.
[3031.00 → 3032.78] Like who would buy
[3032.78 → 3036.22] this thing for $20,000?
[3036.88 → 3038.06] It's got bezels that
[3038.06 → 3039.74] looks like I dragged it
[3039.74 → 3040.68] out of my grandma's
[3040.68 → 3041.08] basement.
[3041.30 → 3042.40] It doesn't even come
[3042.40 → 3043.70] with a remote control
[3043.70 → 3044.72] and it doesn't have
[3044.72 → 3046.40] an HDMI port for crying
[3046.40 → 3046.94] out loud.
[3048.22 → 3048.44] Right.
[3048.52 → 3049.62] So we kind of roast
[3049.62 → 3049.78] it.
[3049.78 → 3049.84] Yeah.
[3049.88 → 3050.58] We kind of, we kind of
[3050.58 → 3051.74] roast it, which is, was
[3051.74 → 3053.36] even more fun because the
[3053.36 → 3054.54] Flanders scientific guys
[3054.54 → 3056.06] were in the room while
[3056.06 → 3056.96] we were filming this.
[3057.60 → 3059.86] The unit, they basically
[3059.86 → 3061.28] hand carried the unit
[3061.28 → 3061.98] because they were on
[3061.98 → 3062.78] their way to do a demo
[3062.78 → 3063.62] somewhere or something
[3063.62 → 3066.02] and allowed us to make a
[3066.02 → 3067.56] video and test it because
[3067.56 → 3068.60] normally we would not have
[3068.60 → 3069.66] access to this kind of
[3069.66 → 3069.90] stuff.
[3070.00 → 3070.70] And then when we were
[3070.70 → 3071.52] done, they had to take it
[3071.52 → 3072.20] away with them.
[3072.74 → 3074.06] Anyway, so we, so we do
[3074.06 → 3074.72] this bit.
[3075.22 → 3076.86] And as part of that, I
[3076.86 → 3078.06] wanted to have a
[3078.06 → 3079.18] comparison point for,
[3079.32 → 3080.32] okay, well, what's a
[3080.72 → 3081.58] what's kind of your going
[3081.58 → 3082.70] rate for a 55 inch
[3082.70 → 3083.02] monitor?
[3083.02 → 3083.68] Because sure, you could
[3083.68 → 3085.22] spend $1,200 on a 55
[3085.22 → 3086.50] inch, did I say monitor?
[3086.64 → 3086.80] Sorry.
[3087.46 → 3088.50] The Flanders scientific is a
[3088.50 → 3089.78] monitor, but I was talking
[3089.78 → 3090.18] TV.
[3090.60 → 3091.34] So you could, you could
[3091.34 → 3092.52] spend like $1,200 on a
[3092.52 → 3093.88] 55-inch TV, but you could
[3093.88 → 3095.50] also spend X.
[3095.56 → 3096.34] I wanted to know like how,
[3096.42 → 3097.52] how low, how low have they
[3097.52 → 3098.10] gotten these days?
[3098.22 → 3100.38] And so the exercise was
[3100.38 → 3104.20] electronics, television and
[3104.20 → 3107.62] video, and trying to find a
[3107.62 → 3108.06] television.
[3110.18 → 3110.92] There's one.
[3111.52 → 3113.34] Here's a 40-inch Vizio.
[3116.18 → 3117.06] Here's an antenna.
[3117.28 → 3117.54] What even are some of these
[3117.54 → 3117.84] things?
[3117.92 → 3118.38] An antenna?
[3118.58 → 3118.76] Okay.
[3118.76 → 3120.40] Here's a magic stick.
[3122.06 → 3123.48] I think there's a song about
[3123.48 → 3123.78] that.
[3124.38 → 3124.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3124.90 → 3126.28] It's the, the, the penis of
[3126.28 → 3126.80] magic, right?
[3126.94 → 3127.20] Mm-hmm.
[3127.68 → 3128.38] Magic stick.
[3128.56 → 3129.50] Mm-hmm.
[3131.42 → 3132.96] A man of culture, I see.
[3133.10 → 3135.54] Here's a USB-C cable.
[3137.42 → 3139.24] Here are some sponsored results
[3139.24 → 3141.80] for a To slink cable.
[3144.28 → 3145.12] That's cool.
[3145.12 → 3148.68] Did I do something wrong?
[3148.68 → 3149.02] One TV.
[3150.52 → 3151.46] Amazon.com.
[3151.50 → 3151.78] Maybe.
[3153.38 → 3153.74] Um.
[3156.02 → 3157.12] Enhancer says, I've never
[3157.12 → 3158.00] had the issues you've had
[3158.00 → 3158.96] with Amazon, but I never
[3158.96 → 3159.82] searched by category.
[3159.96 → 3160.84] I just searched what I want
[3160.84 → 3161.14] to find.
[3161.16 → 3161.32] I was going to say, I wonder
[3161.32 → 3161.86] if it's a category.
[3161.98 → 3162.64] So I just searched.
[3163.48 → 3164.50] What's going on with me right
[3164.50 → 3164.60] now?
[3164.72 → 3165.10] Okay, let's go to Luke Laptop.
[3165.56 → 3165.84] Yeah.
[3165.94 → 3166.94] I just searched the word
[3166.94 → 3167.42] television.
[3167.94 → 3168.30] Sure.
[3168.40 → 3171.32] But like, I want to browse
[3171.32 → 3171.82] Luke.
[3172.46 → 3173.14] Is this not browsing?
[3173.14 → 3176.08] See, look, they figured
[3176.08 → 3176.30] it out.
[3176.36 → 3177.20] The filters on the side
[3177.20 → 3177.88] are all TV filters.
[3177.88 → 3179.12] Oh my God, but why?
[3179.64 → 3181.66] Why is, why did what I,
[3181.92 → 3183.38] why is it that what I did
[3183.38 → 3183.96] didn't work?
[3184.04 → 3184.96] I searched TV and that
[3184.96 → 3185.40] worked too.
[3187.00 → 3188.34] I'm not saying you're wrong.
[3188.56 → 3190.16] I'm just saying that I.
[3190.42 → 3191.26] You're just saying to get
[3191.26 → 3191.56] good.
[3191.70 → 3192.12] Am right.
[3194.64 → 3196.00] I mean, okay, maybe try
[3196.00 → 3196.78] and find it then.
[3196.94 → 3197.94] Maybe I missed it.
[3198.00 → 3199.36] I legitimately don't use
[3199.36 → 3199.70] Amazon.
[3199.86 → 3200.74] So where, where is it?
[3200.82 → 3201.38] Where's TV?
[3201.38 → 3201.46] TV.
[3202.88 → 3203.58] Isn't it in here?
[3203.64 → 3204.56] You could try movies and
[3204.56 → 3205.02] television.
[3205.18 → 3205.84] That's not the one I
[3205.84 → 3206.24] clicked on.
[3206.62 → 3206.98] Okay.
[3207.16 → 3208.20] Or what did I, what did I,
[3208.26 → 3209.40] what did I click on exactly?
[3209.50 → 3209.96] I switched.
[3210.20 → 3211.72] I looked at televisions and
[3211.72 → 3212.46] video products.
[3212.82 → 3213.50] Where's that?
[3213.60 → 3213.72] Okay.
[3213.72 → 3214.64] No, that was, that was,
[3214.72 → 3215.28] that was content.
[3215.28 → 3216.22] I don't think I have that.
[3217.04 → 3217.36] Seriously?
[3218.50 → 3219.02] Hold on.
[3219.12 → 3219.48] I don't know.
[3219.56 → 3219.70] I.
[3220.00 → 3220.62] No, you don't.
[3220.62 → 3221.44] I am not kidding.
[3221.58 → 3222.20] I don't use Amazon.
[3222.20 → 3223.04] It's under electronics.
[3223.26 → 3223.44] Okay.
[3223.44 → 3223.88] It's nested.
[3224.44 → 3225.12] Yeah, there we go.
[3225.14 → 3225.46] There we go.
[3225.70 → 3225.92] Okay.
[3226.02 → 3226.40] So fine.
[3226.48 → 3227.30] Where are the where are the
[3227.30 → 3228.20] bloody TVs then?
[3228.38 → 3229.06] Television and video.
[3229.06 → 3233.08] What even is that?
[3233.24 → 3233.82] I don't know.
[3233.94 → 3234.56] It's cool though.
[3234.92 → 3238.36] It's a replacement lamp for a
[3238.36 → 3239.36] projector, I guess.
[3240.42 → 3241.44] It looks sick.
[3242.22 → 3242.58] Yeah.
[3242.70 → 3243.38] For a projector.
[3246.86 → 3248.46] For the restoration of colour,
[3248.52 → 3249.86] it will bring you a feeling of
[3249.86 → 3250.54] being immersed.
[3253.54 → 3254.74] People are telling me, hold on,
[3254.78 → 3255.00] hold on.
[3255.06 → 3255.96] People are telling me I need to
[3255.96 → 3256.34] go, hold on.
[3256.38 → 3257.22] We're going back to my screen.
[3257.22 → 3258.44] People are telling me I need to
[3258.44 → 3259.52] go one level deeper.
[3260.32 → 3260.44] Oh.
[3260.56 → 3261.26] No, I don't.
[3261.36 → 3262.56] There is no level deeper.
[3262.80 → 3263.34] Model year.
[3263.46 → 3264.10] What's that movie?
[3264.92 → 3266.06] I mean, at least model year
[3266.06 → 3267.26] brings up some TVs.
[3267.26 → 3267.90] Inception, yeah.
[3267.98 → 3268.86] You got to go deeper.
[3269.70 → 3270.76] I don't think there's a
[3270.76 → 3271.42] deeper layer.
[3271.56 → 3272.34] What is this?
[3274.36 → 3275.18] The easy mode?
[3275.20 → 3276.54] Universal big button TV remote.
[3277.20 → 3277.44] Yeah.
[3277.74 → 3280.12] Wow, they sold 6,000 reviews
[3280.12 → 3280.58] of this thing.
[3281.06 → 3281.82] What is this?
[3281.98 → 3283.62] This is a Sab rent Thunderbolt
[3283.62 → 3284.68] Ethernet adapter.
[3284.68 → 3287.50] What is this doing here?
[3288.40 → 3290.70] This is an absolute quagmire.
[3290.90 → 3291.84] Get that bread, Sab rent.
[3292.86 → 3294.90] And I don't see, I'm sorry, guys.
[3294.98 → 3297.34] I don't see 3D.
[3297.80 → 3298.16] Really?
[3298.82 → 3300.12] What year is it?
[3302.40 → 3303.04] Smart TV?
[3303.18 → 3304.26] You mean every TV?
[3304.42 → 3305.28] Okay, this might help.
[3305.38 → 3305.96] This might help.
[3306.34 → 3308.60] Okay, so if I click smart TV.
[3308.84 → 3310.12] Then that's actually, I think,
[3310.14 → 3311.44] a lot of the same results I got
[3311.44 → 3312.52] when I just searched TV.
[3312.66 → 3313.90] That's the magic hack.
[3313.90 → 3315.16] So that's the deeper level.
[3315.28 → 3316.56] And I understand why you would
[3316.56 → 3317.62] just search TV.
[3318.06 → 3320.08] But let me explain why I don't
[3320.08 → 3320.76] want to do that.
[3320.98 → 3321.08] Sure.
[3321.26 → 3322.54] Because if I search,
[3323.00 → 3324.64] then I am at the mercy of
[3324.64 → 3326.06] whatever you're being paid the
[3326.06 → 3326.76] most to promote.
[3327.32 → 3327.72] 100%.
[3327.72 → 3329.18] I am just, I am letting you.
[3329.18 → 3330.48] But in my logic, if you go to
[3330.48 → 3331.60] the department, it's the same thing.
[3332.76 → 3333.66] You don't think they're going to
[3333.66 → 3334.76] advertise on the department level?
[3334.78 → 3336.16] Well, no, because on the
[3336.16 → 3337.70] department level, I want filters.
[3338.08 → 3340.48] That's, or I expect to find
[3340.48 → 3340.68] filters.
[3340.68 → 3342.48] But I got filters when I searched TV.
[3342.48 → 3343.30] That's ridiculous.
[3343.72 → 3344.18] A little bit.
[3344.60 → 3345.88] Why don't I get filters?
[3347.64 → 3349.48] Yeah, like if I just go to
[3349.48 → 3351.94] your category view, all the
[3351.94 → 3352.96] first results are sponsored.
[3353.10 → 3353.50] 100%.
[3353.50 → 3355.12] Like that lamp replacement thing
[3355.12 → 3355.96] is a sponsored post.
[3355.96 → 3356.32] Oh, I know.
[3356.50 → 3357.10] It says right there.
[3357.92 → 3359.54] You're seeing this ad based on
[3359.54 → 3361.12] the product's relevance to your
[3361.12 → 3361.78] search query.
[3361.86 → 3363.18] No, I am not.
[3366.24 → 3366.76] Sort of.
[3366.76 → 3368.18] No, I am not.
[3368.46 → 3370.32] This two-star lamp replacement
[3370.32 → 3371.76] is very relevant.
[3372.36 → 3374.66] Dude, this is a dumpster fire.
[3375.22 → 3375.46] Yeah.
[3376.00 → 3377.16] I can't even believe this.
[3377.30 → 3378.56] Well, it's the it's the
[3378.66 → 3379.94] where even is the mute button?
[3380.04 → 3381.94] It's the notification of,
[3382.00 → 3383.46] I don't think I did that properly.
[3383.46 → 3383.66] Yeah.
[3383.96 → 3384.44] Well, fine.
[3384.54 → 3384.90] Good job.
[3385.76 → 3387.78] Of Amazon and other various
[3387.78 → 3388.44] websites, right?
[3388.64 → 3389.72] Like it's just getting worse.
[3389.76 → 3390.98] But this isn't sustainable.
[3391.92 → 3392.88] Go to try Amazon.
[3392.88 → 3393.90] So here, hold on.
[3394.02 → 3395.06] What's really, what's really
[3395.06 → 3397.70] wild to me is if, look, okay.
[3397.80 → 3398.96] You know, the, the category
[3398.96 → 3400.18] that I drilled down into just
[3400.18 → 3401.58] doesn't have the TVs in it or
[3401.58 → 3401.88] whatever.
[3402.08 → 3404.80] I could see that, but no, it
[3404.80 → 3407.02] does because when I click on
[3407.02 → 3409.06] smart TV, they're all here.
[3409.92 → 3413.02] They just didn't think that
[3413.02 → 3415.56] was relevant to my interests.
[3415.72 → 3417.14] I mean, what even is this stuff?
[3417.58 → 3418.02] Okay.
[3418.08 → 3418.86] An HDMI splitter.
[3418.98 → 3419.12] Sure.
[3419.24 → 3421.26] But a Sega Genesis HDMI
[3421.26 → 3421.86] adapter.
[3421.86 → 3423.84] What are the odds, Amazon?
[3424.50 → 3426.00] What are the odds?
[3426.22 → 3427.74] Hey, hey, Amazon.ca is
[3427.74 → 3428.52] actually better.
[3429.54 → 3430.90] People recommended that and
[3430.90 → 3431.66] they're not wrong.
[3431.98 → 3432.68] Oh, wow.
[3432.94 → 3435.18] So I, I went, I went to all
[3435.18 → 3436.72] and then I had to scroll down
[3436.72 → 3438.04] further, I think.
[3438.74 → 3440.06] Shop by department,
[3441.42 → 3442.72] electronics, computer and
[3442.72 → 3442.98] office.
[3443.08 → 3443.76] Is this what I did?
[3444.34 → 3444.56] Yeah.
[3444.58 → 3445.94] And then TV and home theatre.
[3446.12 → 3447.78] So there were two more layers
[3447.78 → 3448.10] here.
[3448.22 → 3448.96] So that's probably what that
[3448.96 → 3449.88] person was talking about.
[3450.16 → 3451.62] And then I clicked on TV and
[3451.62 → 3452.52] home theatre, and it brought
[3452.52 → 3453.08] me here.
[3453.26 → 3454.70] And then there was another
[3454.70 → 3456.52] layer where you just have to
[3456.52 → 3458.18] click on televisions, which is
[3458.18 → 3459.98] fine because all these other
[3459.98 → 3461.18] things are related to what I've
[3461.18 → 3461.84] done so far.
[3461.90 → 3462.74] So televisions.
[3463.10 → 3464.58] And then boom, I got a bunch of
[3464.58 → 3464.92] TVs.
[3465.70 → 3466.36] Let's see.
[3466.36 → 3468.16] Some people are saying that.
[3468.42 → 3469.04] Oh, hold on.
[3469.10 → 3469.94] Hold on.
[3470.84 → 3471.24] Ship.
[3471.94 → 3473.16] Some people are saying that it
[3473.16 → 3475.72] might matter that it says ship to
[3475.72 → 3477.64] Canada in the top.
[3477.84 → 3479.34] So I'm changing it to.
[3480.58 → 3482.10] Why is it not?
[3482.48 → 3483.28] I'm going to go back to.
[3483.52 → 3484.26] Oh, my God.
[3484.26 → 3485.90] Why is it not in the drop-down?
[3486.96 → 3488.52] United States, minor outlying
[3488.52 → 3488.90] islands.
[3489.04 → 3489.22] No.
[3489.32 → 3489.56] What?
[3489.84 → 3489.94] What?
[3489.94 → 3492.96] Is that what Canada is to you
[3492.96 → 3493.18] now?
[3493.26 → 3494.46] A minor outlying island?
[3494.46 → 3495.62] No, I'm just I'm trying to find
[3495.62 → 3497.60] I'm trying to find ship to US in
[3497.60 → 3497.90] the drop-down.
[3497.90 → 3498.38] Come on, America.
[3498.68 → 3499.64] It's not here.
[3500.74 → 3502.00] And it's not here.
[3502.14 → 3502.76] Is there another?
[3504.08 → 3505.32] Have they changed the name to
[3505.32 → 3507.38] Americas tan or something?
[3507.58 → 3509.80] Like where the heck is America?
[3511.80 → 3512.16] Whatever.
[3512.32 → 3513.68] I just I put in I put in the only
[3513.68 → 3514.50] zip code I know.
[3515.08 → 3516.58] So 90210.
[3517.84 → 3518.48] Here we go.
[3518.54 → 3519.42] Let's refresh the page.
[3520.44 → 3520.80] Nope.
[3521.72 → 3522.46] Sorry, folks.
[3523.08 → 3523.40] Electronics.
[3523.88 → 3526.34] You got to put in a 2500
[3526.34 → 3527.96] televisions and video products.
[3528.04 → 3528.26] Here we go.
[3528.46 → 3528.94] 0500.
[3529.44 → 3529.76] Yeah.
[3530.98 → 3531.50] All right.
[3531.70 → 3532.06] Cool.
[3537.82 → 3538.52] America's attic.
[3538.74 → 3539.70] We are not.
[3540.10 → 3540.72] No, we're the hat.
[3540.86 → 3541.24] Come on now.
[3541.36 → 3541.62] Yeah.
[3541.76 → 3542.12] Figure it out.
[3542.18 → 3542.96] Really nice hat.
[3543.08 → 3543.32] Warm.
[3543.68 → 3543.86] Yeah.
[3544.50 → 3546.20] A beaver hat, you might say.
[3547.02 → 3547.74] Beaver hat.
[3547.96 → 3548.76] Sold out of.
[3549.12 → 3550.12] What are we supposed to be doing
[3550.12 → 3550.46] right now?
[3550.52 → 3551.40] What even is this show?
[3551.62 → 3552.04] The Hudson's Bay?
[3552.36 → 3553.14] Who knows?
[3554.96 → 3556.88] You know, it's amazing how much
[3556.88 → 3558.28] of Canada, the Hudson's Bay
[3558.28 → 3559.42] company owned.
[3559.62 → 3560.08] Oh, yeah.
[3560.22 → 3562.02] Like a couple of hundred years ago.
[3562.32 → 3564.44] Like actually owned the country.
[3564.60 → 3565.96] And now they're like almost gone.
[3566.06 → 3566.30] Yeah.
[3566.50 → 3566.92] Kind of.
[3567.18 → 3568.28] What a way to fall.
[3568.38 → 3568.50] Yeah.
[3568.56 → 3569.04] What a.
[3571.04 → 3572.54] What a story arcs.
[3572.54 → 3574.54] Amazing.
[3576.54 → 3577.86] Canada actually has some genuinely
[3577.86 → 3579.20] very interesting history.
[3581.16 → 3581.78] Oh, yeah.
[3582.02 → 3582.26] Yeah.
[3582.38 → 3582.78] For sure.
[3582.86 → 3583.84] Like, like, actually.
[3584.04 → 3584.26] Yep.
[3584.46 → 3585.70] And I'm not even just saying that
[3585.70 → 3587.52] because I'm also Canadian, but like
[3587.52 → 3588.52] it actually does.
[3589.94 → 3590.36] Yeah.
[3591.28 → 3591.68] Anyway.
[3591.88 → 3595.32] It like literally was the fur trade
[3595.32 → 3596.04] for a while.
[3596.10 → 3598.22] That was its only point in existing.
[3598.22 → 3599.80] And that's why Hudson's Bay like
[3599.80 → 3600.48] owned it all.
[3600.70 → 3601.82] It was super weird.
[3602.10 → 3602.50] I don't know.
[3602.68 → 3603.16] Oh, hey, Luke.
[3603.22 → 3603.88] Check this out.
[3603.98 → 3604.34] What's up?
[3606.04 → 3607.66] TV and video up here.
[3608.14 → 3608.50] Oh.
[3611.14 → 3611.50] Day.
[3611.70 → 3613.34] Now you got that Canadian page.
[3613.42 → 3614.42] Now you click on televisions.
[3614.56 → 3614.68] Yeah.
[3614.72 → 3614.84] No.
[3615.24 → 3615.44] No.
[3615.54 → 3615.68] Yeah.
[3615.72 → 3615.86] No.
[3615.86 → 3616.24] Hold on.
[3616.28 → 3616.56] Hold on.
[3616.60 → 3616.76] Okay.
[3616.82 → 3618.30] So what happened?
[3618.30 → 3621.82] So from the homepage, if I go here
[3621.82 → 3626.00] and I go to shop by department,
[3626.38 → 3631.00] see all electronics, TV and video.
[3633.12 → 3635.02] What the just happened?
[3644.08 → 3644.80] All right.
[3644.82 → 3646.72] At least I can find televisions now.
[3646.76 → 3647.38] So that's good.
[3647.38 → 3649.76] So I want to know how much a 55-inch TV.
[3651.16 → 3651.52] Great.
[3653.62 → 3655.18] 50 to 59 inches then.
[3655.96 → 3656.32] Fine.
[3658.38 → 3659.08] I'll settle.
[3660.16 → 3661.90] Anyway, we found the answer before.
[3662.00 → 3663.22] It's about 250 bucks.
[3663.36 → 3664.90] It is what the kind of going rate
[3664.90 → 3667.74] for a basic 55-inch TV is.
[3667.80 → 3669.12] In fact, I think this might be the one
[3669.12 → 3669.92] that we settled on.
[3671.74 → 3672.86] It is amazing.
[3673.06 → 3673.72] Oh, no, that's not it.
[3673.74 → 3674.42] That's 50 inches.
[3674.80 → 3675.26] It is amazing.
[3675.26 → 3676.42] It's pretty wild that you can get
[3676.42 → 3678.34] a nice 50-inch TV for 260 bucks.
[3678.34 → 3678.84] Yeah, here it is.
[3678.94 → 3679.26] This one.
[3679.76 → 3681.58] TV prices are something that have not
[3681.58 → 3683.42] gone the route of graphics cards, it seems.
[3683.58 → 3684.38] No, no.
[3684.48 → 3686.96] They somehow managed to keep getting cheaper.
[3687.32 → 3687.92] That's wild.
[3688.22 → 3689.18] They have...
[3689.18 → 3690.88] Man, I've talked about this before,
[3691.00 → 3693.34] but I actually got to experience it
[3693.34 → 3694.84] firsthand for a while.
[3695.84 → 3698.42] Firsthand for the first time.
[3698.42 → 3701.44] Because for the first time in my life,
[3701.56 → 3704.46] I went to a store and bought a TV.
[3705.92 → 3706.98] Not to make a video.
[3707.22 → 3708.90] You know, I've only ever done that once too.
[3709.00 → 3712.20] Just to have a TV so that I would have it.
[3712.32 → 3712.78] Yeah, me too.
[3712.82 → 3713.62] I've only ever done that once.
[3713.70 → 3716.00] My grandparents have a...
[3716.00 → 3717.52] Had a pretty small TV.
[3717.70 → 3720.18] It was like 38 inches or 40 inches
[3720.18 → 3721.10] or something like that.
[3721.26 → 3723.54] And their vision is not what it was.
[3723.54 → 3726.70] And they do not have...
[3726.70 → 3728.38] At their age, they don't have the capability
[3728.38 → 3730.78] to go to a store and buy a TV
[3730.78 → 3731.54] at this point anymore.
[3731.72 → 3734.54] So I was over there, and they were talking about,
[3734.60 → 3736.84] you know, some of the hassle with it.
[3736.86 → 3737.90] And I was like, tell you what,
[3738.40 → 3740.16] Merry Christmas, new TV, sure.
[3741.06 → 3744.40] So we went down to visit them last weekend.
[3745.20 → 3746.16] And I was like, oh,
[3746.48 → 3748.02] I still owe you your Christmas present.
[3748.26 → 3750.34] It's late January.
[3752.34 → 3752.70] Peace.
[3752.70 → 3753.74] I'll be back.
[3754.00 → 3756.32] And so I went to London Drugs of all places
[3756.32 → 3757.48] because it was close.
[3757.48 → 3757.80] That is a thing.
[3757.92 → 3759.92] They actually have a surprisingly solid
[3759.92 → 3760.94] electronics department.
[3761.48 → 3762.76] It's always surprised me.
[3762.94 → 3765.74] They carry Samsung, LG, Hi sense.
[3766.22 → 3767.04] Oh, wow.
[3767.14 → 3767.30] Sure.
[3767.76 → 3768.48] And Sony.
[3769.00 → 3769.26] Yeah.
[3769.38 → 3770.60] And so I was like, okay,
[3770.70 → 3771.42] well, let's have a look.
[3774.36 → 3775.52] I don't...
[3775.52 → 3777.98] I totally understand.
[3778.26 → 3779.22] Or actually, no.
[3779.22 → 3784.00] I don't understand how enough people are buying...
[3784.00 → 3786.42] Makes no sense, especially with shipping costs.
[3786.62 → 3789.04] Like LG and Samsung TVs,
[3789.82 → 3791.50] given how much more they cost.
[3791.60 → 3792.68] Like I understand why...
[3792.68 → 3792.96] Compared to the Hi sense ones?
[3792.98 → 3794.66] I understand why TCL and Hi sense
[3794.66 → 3797.12] are gaining so much ground in North America right now.
[3797.12 → 3800.40] Because it was literally half the price.
[3800.40 → 3803.06] And even to my eye,
[3803.38 → 3803.88] I was like,
[3804.62 → 3807.54] yeah, it looks good enough for me, ma, and people.
[3808.78 → 3810.66] So I ended up with a Hi sense.
[3811.26 → 3811.96] I know, right?
[3812.32 → 3812.50] Like,
[3812.50 → 3816.48] got rid of my TV-buying virginity
[3816.48 → 3817.72] with Hi sense, of all people.
[3819.56 → 3820.00] Right?
[3820.20 → 3821.44] I'll remember it forever, though.
[3822.62 → 3823.34] Unforgettable moment.
[3823.84 → 3824.44] So anyway,
[3825.06 → 3825.58] again,
[3825.88 → 3826.88] looking at price...
[3826.88 → 3831.14] Does he hear Dan sigh from behind the camera?
[3831.14 → 3833.10] No, I always think about things that I want to say,
[3833.22 → 3835.38] and then they're just absolutely not appropriate.
[3835.98 → 3837.02] Again, looking at the pricing,
[3837.02 → 3842.42] the difference between 55 inches and 65 inches
[3842.42 → 3844.74] is basically negligible.
[3845.24 → 3845.82] So I was like,
[3845.86 → 3846.54] okay, yeah.
[3846.98 → 3848.76] Well, let's get them a 65-inch TV.
[3848.88 → 3850.06] Let's get something nice and big
[3850.06 → 3851.40] so they can, you know,
[3851.76 → 3853.16] see National Geographic
[3853.16 → 3855.06] or whatever it is that they watch.
[3855.16 → 3855.70] Figure skating.
[3855.96 → 3856.26] I don't know.
[3856.40 → 3856.58] Cool.
[3856.76 → 3856.94] Yeah.
[3857.18 → 3858.72] My grandma likes figure skating, right?
[3858.94 → 3859.10] Yeah.
[3859.10 → 3860.34] So 65-inch TV.
[3860.44 → 3860.88] Very impressive.
[3861.22 → 3863.54] So I took my son with me on this errand
[3863.54 → 3865.40] because he doesn't do enough errands,
[3865.42 → 3865.92] and I was like,
[3866.00 → 3866.80] you're going to do an errand.
[3867.92 → 3869.04] Let's go get a console.
[3869.28 → 3870.44] We needed to get a new console table
[3870.44 → 3871.72] because we discovered,
[3872.02 → 3872.18] you know,
[3872.22 → 3873.18] we found the TV we wanted
[3873.18 → 3874.76] and realized it had the new style stand
[3874.76 → 3876.38] because it's cheaper for them to make
[3876.38 → 3877.94] with the two feet on the edges
[3877.94 → 3879.44] instead of the single thing
[3879.44 → 3880.68] that kind of supports it at the back.
[3880.82 → 3881.78] So we had to go to Ikea.
[3881.88 → 3882.52] We had to get a little,
[3882.64 → 3883.74] a new little console table.
[3883.98 → 3884.60] So we got that,
[3884.68 → 3885.18] threw it in the trunk.
[3885.54 → 3886.88] We went back to London Drugs,
[3887.12 → 3887.82] picked up the TV
[3887.82 → 3889.00] that we'd gotten the quote for.
[3889.12 → 3890.40] They had put it aside for us,
[3890.70 → 3891.64] dragged it out to the parking lot
[3891.64 → 3891.92] and went,
[3892.16 → 3892.86] oh, s***.
[3893.04 → 3893.52] Doesn't fit.
[3893.52 → 3898.42] It's a good lesson on running errands.
[3898.42 → 3899.86] Why would I drive the Taycan?
[3900.02 → 3901.38] You were just trying to be
[3901.38 → 3904.36] a dad who teaches his son things.
[3904.44 → 3905.60] Why did I take the Taycan though?
[3905.66 → 3906.48] That was it.
[3906.58 → 3907.20] You were trying to teach him a lesson.
[3907.20 → 3907.36] Yeah,
[3907.36 → 3908.80] but why did I take the Taycan?
[3909.12 → 3909.84] I don't know.
[3910.94 → 3911.94] It's because I didn't think about it.
[3911.94 → 3913.12] I didn't think we were going to go out
[3913.12 → 3913.80] and buy a TV.
[3914.06 → 3914.24] No,
[3914.32 → 3915.66] because you were trying to teach him a lesson.
[3915.66 → 3916.70] I would have taken the minivan.
[3916.70 → 3917.18] I would have taken you an out here, man.
[3917.26 → 3917.64] Come on.
[3917.66 → 3918.60] I would have taken the minivan.
[3918.96 → 3919.12] Yeah.
[3920.74 → 3922.32] So the real reason I drove the Taycan
[3922.32 → 3923.40] is because I like driving it
[3923.40 → 3924.18] and because it's electric.
[3924.48 → 3924.68] Yeah.
[3924.74 → 3925.74] I hate going to the gas station.
[3925.92 → 3926.14] Yeah.
[3926.18 → 3926.84] I hate it.
[3927.44 → 3927.64] Yeah.
[3928.22 → 3929.70] So for those wondering,
[3929.88 → 3931.56] for those Taycan drivers out there
[3931.56 → 3932.66] who have a Taycan,
[3932.98 → 3938.04] you cannot fit a 65-inch TV in the trunk
[3938.04 → 3943.76] unless in the rain,
[3943.76 → 3947.26] you unbox the TV in the parking lot.
[3947.42 → 3948.16] Oh my God.
[3951.46 → 3954.72] Put it in with about this much clearance
[3954.72 → 3955.86] to either side.
[3956.72 → 3958.30] Take all the accessories out,
[3958.60 → 3960.18] put them under it,
[3960.70 → 3962.00] drag the box back inside,
[3962.08 → 3962.24] say,
[3962.32 → 3962.52] hey,
[3962.92 → 3965.10] can you throw this in the compactor for me?
[3965.46 → 3968.16] And then hope to whatever deity you believe in
[3968.16 → 3969.76] that that thing is not DOA.
[3972.28 → 3973.24] You could have,
[3973.24 → 3975.58] I've done stuff like this before.
[3975.66 → 3975.86] Yeah.
[3975.94 → 3977.08] You could have plugged it in
[3977.08 → 3978.36] and turned it on while you were there.
[3978.98 → 3979.32] Yeah.
[3979.52 → 3980.88] I didn't think of that.
[3981.22 → 3981.82] That's fine.
[3982.30 → 3983.08] That's amazing.
[3983.20 → 3983.62] Anywho.
[3983.78 → 3984.40] This is actually,
[3984.60 → 3985.24] this is actually not the...
[3985.24 → 3986.26] That is a different lesson.
[3986.44 → 3986.68] Yeah.
[3986.88 → 3988.06] Maybe not the best one,
[3988.16 → 3989.88] but you get her done no matter what.
[3989.90 → 3990.10] Yeah.
[3990.14 → 3990.32] Yeah.
[3990.38 → 3990.60] I mean,
[3990.64 → 3992.32] that's definitely the lesson.
[3992.44 → 3992.68] Yeah.
[3992.86 → 3995.86] And Mee maw and Pee paw now have...
[3995.86 → 3996.54] And it works?
[3996.70 → 3997.26] Add new TV.
[3997.36 → 3997.90] It does work.
[3997.94 → 3998.52] Mission accomplished.
[3999.14 → 4000.40] Thank the maker.
[4001.12 → 4002.10] Hi sense in this case.
[4002.10 → 4002.48] Yeah.
[4002.48 → 4002.58] Yeah.
[4003.78 → 4004.44] Good job.
[4005.32 → 4006.94] I've actually had to do that before.
[4007.16 → 4008.94] The last time was buying...
[4008.94 → 4009.32] Sorry,
[4009.44 → 4010.42] sort of in float plane chat.
[4010.50 → 4011.20] Ty can't.
[4011.98 → 4012.60] Just got him.
[4012.72 → 4013.64] But it could in this case.
[4013.74 → 4014.78] So it is still a Ty can.
[4015.16 → 4017.78] So a 65-inch TV does fit in a Ty can.
[4017.86 → 4018.06] No,
[4018.14 → 4019.16] that's not the lesson.
[4020.50 → 4021.24] That's the takeaway.
[4021.24 → 4022.98] I actually have had to do this before,
[4023.16 → 4024.94] and it was way worse.
[4025.86 → 4026.62] When we moved to...
[4026.62 → 4026.72] Wait,
[4026.74 → 4029.02] so this is the second time you've moved a TV with the Ty can?
[4029.02 → 4029.18] No,
[4029.20 → 4029.28] no,
[4029.32 → 4029.96] it wasn't a TV.
[4030.14 → 4030.32] Oh,
[4030.38 → 4030.52] okay.
[4030.64 → 4030.78] Yeah,
[4030.86 → 4031.02] no,
[4031.08 → 4032.36] the first time I've had to do...
[4032.36 → 4032.48] No,
[4032.54 → 4032.78] I mean,
[4032.84 → 4034.68] I mean unpack something in a parking lot.
[4035.50 → 4035.86] Ah.
[4036.40 → 4038.78] The first time was way worse.
[4039.30 → 4040.44] It was at Costco,
[4040.44 → 4043.12] which should give you some idea where I'm going with this,
[4043.20 → 4044.88] and it was a king-sized bed frame.
[4044.88 → 4049.68] For some reason,
[4049.80 → 4051.82] because I don't believe in planning.
[4052.70 → 4055.28] I already had a bunch of stuff in the back of the van.
[4055.54 → 4055.76] Ah,
[4055.80 → 4056.14] nice.
[4056.74 → 4057.04] Good.
[4057.28 → 4061.34] So I had to completely dismantle,
[4061.38 → 4062.00] and at Costco,
[4062.26 → 4062.60] I was,
[4062.96 → 4063.50] I don't know,
[4063.56 → 4066.08] I was afraid to even ask them to take the packaging for me.
[4066.08 → 4069.98] So I basically Tetris-ed the crap out of this thing,
[4070.36 → 4072.98] putting in the pieces every way that I could,
[4072.98 → 4076.56] trying to use the packaging to keep it from,
[4076.74 → 4076.94] like,
[4077.12 → 4079.84] to keep the pieces from destroying and scratching each other.
[4080.08 → 4081.14] And at the end of it,
[4081.28 → 4085.20] I was able to shove the trunk latched.
[4086.40 → 4087.66] It was completely full.
[4087.96 → 4088.82] Completely solid.
[4090.94 → 4091.50] Yeah.
[4091.82 → 4092.10] So,
[4092.10 → 4092.54] um,
[4093.94 → 4094.68] plan ahead.
[4095.86 → 4096.88] You won't.
[4096.98 → 4097.12] Well,
[4097.16 → 4097.40] it's like,
[4097.46 → 4097.54] what,
[4097.58 → 4098.50] I'm going to pay for delivery?
[4098.90 → 4099.58] Come on.
[4099.58 → 4104.92] Oh man.
[4105.00 → 4105.60] And like that,
[4105.70 → 4106.38] that bed frame,
[4106.48 → 4107.36] it was wrapped in that,
[4107.42 → 4107.58] you know,
[4107.60 → 4108.18] that really,
[4108.28 → 4109.74] really thin foam wrap.
[4109.88 → 4110.82] So it was wrapped in that.
[4110.90 → 4111.52] It was a windy day.
[4111.58 → 4113.04] And it was like blowing all over the place and stuff.
[4113.22 → 4113.52] It was,
[4113.52 → 4113.54] it was,
[4113.54 → 4113.56] it was,
[4113.56 → 4113.58] it was,
[4113.58 → 4113.98] it was,
[4113.98 → 4114.04] it was,
[4114.04 → 4114.48] it was,
[4114.48 → 4116.46] I was in the loading zone in front of the store.
[4116.62 → 4118.90] So people were like watching me do this.
[4120.18 → 4122.86] I'm pretty sure at least one person walked by and was like,
[4122.92 → 4123.40] Hey Linus.
[4123.50 → 4123.82] Cause like,
[4123.86 → 4124.80] it's not like I'm anonymous.
[4124.80 → 4128.52] Oh my goodness.
[4130.48 → 4131.38] That's fantastic.
[4131.78 → 4133.04] Won't pay $10 for delivery.
[4133.14 → 4134.64] So I'll spend two hours bagging it.
[4134.66 → 4134.88] But yeah,
[4134.90 → 4136.42] that's two hours that he wasn't working.
[4136.54 → 4136.72] Yeah.
[4137.66 → 4138.60] Delivery for $10.
[4138.92 → 4140.90] I can't get Uber Eats delivered for $10.
[4141.28 → 4142.06] Never mind a TV.
[4142.22 → 4142.86] What are you talking about?
[4142.90 → 4143.10] Yeah.
[4143.76 → 4143.92] $10.
[4144.28 → 4144.52] Yeah.
[4146.12 → 4148.08] What's that line that Bill Gates,
[4148.32 → 4148.72] backflip,
[4149.00 → 4149.40] Bill Gates,
[4149.46 → 4151.30] the Bill Gates character on the Simpsons says,
[4151.36 → 4153.98] you don't get rich by writing a lot of checks or something like that.
[4155.80 → 4156.24] Yeah.
[4156.88 → 4157.50] Oh man.
[4157.64 → 4161.96] That's such a great scene when his goons come in and just start like trashing Homer's living room.
[4163.58 → 4165.06] I don't know if I've seen it.
[4165.06 → 4166.00] He created like a website,
[4166.20 → 4166.44] right?
[4166.60 → 4166.78] Yeah.
[4166.86 → 4168.52] Something like Homer.com with all,
[4168.58 → 4170.38] with like all the junk on it and the ads.
[4170.52 → 4170.72] Yeah.
[4170.76 → 4171.36] And he was just,
[4171.42 → 4173.58] he was just bandwagon on the.com.
[4173.84 → 4174.50] Get them boys.
[4174.90 → 4175.12] Yeah.
[4175.22 → 4177.22] And so Bill Gates rolls up and is like,
[4177.26 → 4179.10] we'd like to acquire your company.
[4179.10 → 4181.56] And it turns out acquire just means like wreck the joint.
[4181.56 → 4184.04] Because it was like a home server.
[4184.04 → 4185.86] That was basically just his computer.
[4186.04 → 4187.64] And they just destroy it with baseball bats.
[4189.84 → 4191.62] I wish the internet worked more like that.
[4192.18 → 4193.30] Your website is cancer.
[4194.80 → 4195.98] We're just going to destroy it.
[4196.08 → 4197.44] We're supposed to explain merch messages.
[4197.80 → 4200.44] So the way to interact with the show is to leave a merch message.
[4201.36 → 4202.16] Don't do a super chat.
[4202.24 → 4203.10] Don't do a Twitch bit.
[4203.28 → 4204.72] It's not like Twitch needs more money.
[4204.80 → 4205.10] Actually,
[4205.18 → 4206.16] they probably kind of do.
[4206.20 → 4207.16] We'll talk about that later.
[4207.16 → 4208.16] Actually,
[4208.84 → 4209.18] why don't we,
[4209.26 → 4209.38] yeah.
[4209.48 → 4213.30] Why don't we expand that thing we were doing before the show into a bit of a
[4213.52 → 4215.48] more of a topic Twitch and the no good,
[4215.56 → 4216.50] very bad week.
[4216.94 → 4217.34] Um,
[4217.52 → 4217.62] yeah.
[4217.82 → 4218.26] Pokémon left.
[4218.96 → 4219.36] Yeah.
[4219.72 → 4219.98] Yeah.
[4219.98 → 4220.50] So that's,
[4220.58 → 4221.14] that's interesting.
[4221.24 → 4221.58] Anywho,
[4221.98 → 4222.52] um,
[4222.80 → 4223.44] merch messages.
[4223.72 → 4229.60] All you got to do is head to ltdstore.com and put something in your cart, and you will see
[4229.60 → 4231.82] a box for merch messages.
[4232.36 → 4233.78] Once you complete your order,
[4233.88 → 4234.82] it'll go to our producer,
[4234.92 → 4235.14] Dan.
[4235.22 → 4235.66] There he is.
[4235.66 → 4239.04] Who will either forward it to the appropriate party,
[4239.44 → 4244.54] reply to it himself or curate it for me and Luke to respond to.
[4244.76 → 4249.98] We've got a couple of merch announcements before we do a couple of merch messages to show you
[4249.98 → 4250.90] guys kind of how it works.
[4251.28 → 4251.96] First up,
[4252.18 → 4256.40] we have a new newsletter this week going through the minor backpack.
[4256.96 → 4257.16] Oh,
[4257.20 → 4257.60] here it is.
[4258.44 → 4264.12] So make sure you are signed up for the newsletter because we are trying to provide some really
[4264.12 → 4265.72] cool behind the scenes content.
[4266.36 → 4266.38] Um,
[4266.38 → 4272.48] Tatiana actually hosted a video over on float plane where she went through that backpack that
[4272.48 → 4276.68] had been used in a coal mine and contrasted it with a brand new one.
[4276.74 → 4280.74] This was in the lead up to the discovery that the bottom panel was not actually doubled.
[4280.74 → 4285.40] So there's some really cool learnable from all of this from our materials expert.
[4285.90 → 4286.26] Uh,
[4286.26 → 4288.58] what else do we have as an update for the merch team?
[4289.34 → 4289.86] Um,
[4289.86 → 4291.36] okay.
[4291.58 → 4294.32] I am a little confused by this one.
[4295.84 → 4296.36] Oh,
[4296.72 → 4297.34] okay.
[4297.48 → 4300.88] We have a 3D down jacket promo right now.
[4301.06 → 4304.54] I'm just going to have to go to the store to make sure that this is working.
[4305.50 → 4309.58] But as winter reaches sort of the end of winter,
[4310.06 → 4311.24] this is my favourite jacket ever.
[4311.84 → 4312.36] Uh,
[4312.50 → 4313.24] but jackets,
[4313.38 → 4313.90] here we go.
[4313.90 → 4316.78] If you order the 3D down jacket,
[4316.78 → 4319.12] which is a relatively light jacket,
[4319.42 → 4321.98] but very warm for how thin it is.
[4322.08 → 4322.84] Good reviews.
[4323.02 → 4323.90] And there you go.
[4324.32 → 4327.12] You get free shipping for your entire order.
[4327.38 → 4327.42] Oh,
[4327.52 → 4332.66] so if you live somewhere where shipping is expensive and there was some stuff that you were planning to pick up anyway,
[4332.66 → 4338.84] then maybe pick up a 3D down jacket at what will amount to a pretty sizeable discount.
[4339.30 → 4340.00] So there you go.
[4340.02 → 4343.50] You just got to click that box, and you fill out this thing, and it's pretty cool.
[4343.50 → 4345.30] And then you go ahead and check out your order.
[4345.50 → 4351.78] The last thing we have going on the store this week is precision screwdriver notification signups.
[4351.94 → 4358.00] There's going to be a couple of reasons that you're going to want to sign up for the precision screwdriver notification.
[4358.28 → 4361.40] So that's right here on the homepage where work meets play.
[4361.54 → 4362.22] Because it's,
[4362.44 → 4362.80] Oh,
[4362.84 → 4363.10] that's,
[4363.14 → 4364.32] that's cute with a twist.
[4364.32 → 4366.12] Because it's got a really nice,
[4366.12 → 4366.62] uh,
[4366.62 → 4368.54] hybrid ceramic bearing in the top.
[4368.54 → 4370.08] So it'll spin for like a minute.
[4370.08 → 4373.72] If you just kind of lightly give it a little spin.
[4373.88 → 4374.26] Uh,
[4374.26 → 4374.58] anyway,
[4374.58 → 4376.22] there are two reasons you're going to want to sign up.
[4376.28 → 4378.80] First is you'll be the first to know when you can buy it.
[4378.80 → 4388.42] And second is you will be in the pool to potentially get a chance to be one of the first 100 for that first batch of top of production samples.
[4388.42 → 4389.30] Um,
[4389.30 → 4390.64] and then after that,
[4390.68 → 4392.62] everyone else is going to have to wait for mass production.
[4392.62 → 4394.44] So you could end up with it much,
[4394.64 → 4396.92] much earlier than anyone else.
[4397.06 → 4397.54] All right,
[4397.58 → 4397.84] Dan,
[4397.96 → 4399.42] do you want to hit us with a couple of merch messages?
[4399.84 → 4400.02] Yeah,
[4400.08 → 4401.78] I've got some here for you.
[4402.20 → 4402.46] Hi,
[4402.58 → 4403.06] LLD.
[4403.34 → 4404.72] What do you think about pal world?
[4405.16 → 4405.32] Luke,
[4405.34 → 4407.38] how do you feel about regionals and Pokémon Go?
[4408.76 → 4410.34] Even do Pokémon Go look.
[4410.34 → 4411.18] I'm going to let you.
[4411.44 → 4411.60] Yeah.
[4411.64 → 4412.38] He's a Pokémon Go.
[4412.44 → 4412.60] Yeah.
[4412.64 → 4413.14] I didn't know that.
[4413.42 → 4413.82] Um,
[4413.82 → 4422.32] I disagree with pretty much all the things that the Pokémon Go community seems to care about because I play it for wildly different reasons that I think most people do.
[4422.68 → 4422.98] Um,
[4422.98 → 4426.24] so I don't care at all about region regionals and Pokémon Go.
[4426.64 → 4428.02] I don't even care slightly.
[4428.28 → 4428.42] Yeah,
[4428.42 → 4428.72] for you,
[4428.76 → 4430.46] it's just more of a like touch grass thing,
[4430.52 → 4430.68] right?
[4430.78 → 4430.98] Yeah.
[4431.36 → 4431.58] Yeah.
[4431.72 → 4433.28] So like whenever there are some features,
[4433.50 → 4434.64] I thought that was the whole point of Pokémon Go.
[4434.72 → 4435.64] Am I missing something?
[4435.98 → 4436.24] Oh,
[4436.50 → 4436.78] Oh,
[4437.02 → 4437.22] Oh,
[4437.22 → 4437.52] okay.
[4437.74 → 4438.30] I would,
[4438.80 → 4442.42] can I just say that I would like if I'm going to be cancelled.
[4443.82 → 4449.70] I would like for it to be for something other than Pokémon Go.
[4449.80 → 4453.00] This is the only time I've actually feared for my job.
[4453.12 → 4456.04] I thought it was poking the hornet's nest here.
[4456.82 → 4458.42] That reaction when he's like,
[4458.58 → 4458.90] Oh,
[4458.94 → 4459.62] we're here now.
[4459.84 → 4460.42] Let me,
[4460.48 → 4463.64] let me address the community really quick before we go further.
[4463.80 → 4465.42] Not that I'm not going to go further,
[4465.72 → 4466.82] but just control Z,
[4466.96 → 4467.66] control Z.
[4468.68 → 4470.12] You're going to use those mute buttons.
[4470.24 → 4471.10] Now would be the time loop.
[4471.42 → 4472.06] Oh man,
[4472.06 → 4472.94] that was hilarious.
[4472.94 → 4473.50] Um,
[4473.54 → 4473.88] I'd like,
[4473.98 → 4474.90] if I'm going to get cancelled,
[4474.98 → 4476.50] can it at least be for something cool?
[4476.72 → 4477.30] You know,
[4477.34 → 4477.64] like,
[4477.84 → 4478.24] yeah,
[4478.46 → 4479.28] I don't know.
[4479.38 → 4480.06] And like graffiti.
[4480.32 → 4481.16] I don't know.
[4482.64 → 4483.92] People will,
[4484.02 → 4485.00] would absolutely.
[4486.18 → 4486.54] Yeah.
[4486.62 → 4489.54] Hate or like all my takes on Pokémon Go and that's fine.
[4489.54 → 4491.90] And they can just be mad about things and that's okay.
[4492.02 → 4492.30] But,
[4492.30 → 4492.64] but yeah,
[4492.64 → 4493.72] I don't really care about regionals.
[4493.80 → 4495.10] If a regional happens,
[4495.12 → 4497.78] can you explain what a regional is for those of us who don't Pokémon Go?
[4497.86 → 4498.20] Got it.
[4498.20 → 4503.20] Certain Pokémon are only available to be caught in certain areas of the world.
[4503.46 → 4503.76] Right.
[4504.64 → 4505.86] I don't need them.
[4506.16 → 4506.58] Right.
[4507.46 → 4508.40] I don't care.
[4508.88 → 4509.18] Right.
[4509.18 → 4511.30] And now if I happen to be there, and I get one.
[4511.42 → 4511.68] Right.
[4512.48 → 4512.84] Neat.
[4513.20 → 4514.58] And then for anyone in that region,
[4514.76 → 4516.12] I guess it's like,
[4516.48 → 4518.50] if you want it that bad,
[4518.56 → 4519.76] then you can Pokémon come.
[4523.22 → 4524.14] Rather than go.
[4524.42 → 4524.68] Yeah.
[4524.82 → 4525.34] Come get it.
[4525.42 → 4525.66] Yeah.
[4525.82 → 4526.12] Totally.
[4526.12 → 4526.34] Yeah.
[4526.62 → 4527.02] Totally.
[4527.18 → 4528.32] That's probably a different game.
[4528.34 → 4529.70] It also incentivizes like,
[4530.10 → 4533.38] I wouldn't be surprised if it exists though.
[4533.44 → 4533.94] Probably exists.
[4533.94 → 4534.50] Yeah.
[4534.92 → 4535.52] What is it?
[4535.58 → 4536.56] Rule something.
[4537.12 → 4537.32] Something.
[4537.44 → 4537.58] Yeah.
[4537.84 → 4538.02] Yeah.
[4541.40 → 4541.80] Oh,
[4541.84 → 4542.88] there are so many jokes there,
[4542.94 → 4544.12] but I'm just going to leave it where it is.
[4544.44 → 4544.84] Yeah.
[4544.90 → 4546.26] But like when I was in Japan,
[4546.60 → 4549.28] there's a APAC regional,
[4549.50 → 4550.80] which is far-fetched.
[4550.80 → 4551.94] So I caught a bunch of them.
[4552.22 → 4552.36] Yeah.
[4552.36 → 4552.98] When I came back,
[4552.98 → 4554.68] I've just been giving them to people when I'm back.
[4554.74 → 4556.20] So you don't even have to go get it yourself.
[4556.44 → 4556.54] Right.
[4556.98 → 4557.46] If someone,
[4557.58 → 4557.90] you know,
[4557.92 → 4560.14] or someone in the Pokémon community around you,
[4560.66 → 4563.92] which it's very likely one of them will travel at some point.
[4564.10 → 4565.90] happens to go somewhere and gets a bunch of them.
[4566.04 → 4568.48] You can just trade them something when they come back, and then you get it.
[4568.66 → 4569.08] Like it just,
[4569.28 → 4570.34] I don't know who cares.
[4571.12 → 4571.98] Why do you care?
[4573.38 → 4574.10] But I've been,
[4574.30 → 4574.38] I mean,
[4574.48 → 4577.70] it's literally the tagline of the entire franchise.
[4578.52 → 4579.46] You've got to catch them all.
[4579.46 → 4579.58] Okay.
[4579.70 → 4579.94] Okay.
[4580.06 → 4581.00] I just know,
[4581.04 → 4582.30] but this is a very good point.
[4582.38 → 4582.84] I'm just saying,
[4582.90 → 4583.40] I know it is.
[4583.46 → 4583.80] Thank you.
[4583.86 → 4585.94] I've been mulling on this thing that I make very good points.
[4586.18 → 4586.54] We once,
[4586.66 → 4587.18] we one time,
[4587.24 → 4589.42] we both know I'm never going to make this and that's fine,
[4589.68 → 4591.46] but I've been enjoying the mental idea.
[4591.54 → 4593.74] I've been mulling on this video idea of,
[4593.94 → 4597.14] we all suck at playing video games.
[4597.98 → 4598.08] Hmm.
[4599.26 → 4599.84] And my whole,
[4599.94 → 4602.02] my whole point is that we're doing it wrong.
[4603.56 → 4603.96] Yeah.
[4604.00 → 4604.12] Like,
[4604.30 → 4604.44] yeah,
[4604.58 → 4605.60] just because the tag,
[4605.70 → 4605.82] no,
[4605.90 → 4608.28] I'm not saying blame the community video rarely goes over.
[4608.38 → 4608.42] Well,
[4608.48 → 4608.64] yeah,
[4608.64 → 4608.84] yeah,
[4608.84 → 4613.62] but just because the tagline has got to catch them all does not mean that you've got to catch them all.
[4614.26 → 4618.38] Like you should find a way that you have fun in a game and then do that.
[4618.58 → 4618.94] Right.
[4619.04 → 4620.76] But I mean,
[4620.76 → 4624.34] let's look at the Pokémon company's entire raison d'être.
[4624.50 → 4624.64] Like,
[4624.72 → 4627.36] why do they create new Pokémon so that you won't have them all?
[4627.70 → 4633.26] Like they know that this is a compulsive behaviour for people that they need to have them all.
[4633.36 → 4633.62] And they,
[4633.70 → 4635.02] and they feed that.
[4635.38 → 4636.52] They do it on purpose.
[4636.68 → 4637.02] For sure.
[4637.12 → 4637.22] They,
[4637.30 → 4638.62] not only do you have to have them all,
[4638.68 → 4640.10] you have to have them all in this game.
[4640.10 → 4641.46] Then you have to have them all in cards.
[4641.56 → 4641.64] Oh,
[4641.66 → 4641.94] by the way,
[4641.94 → 4643.48] did I mention there are shiny cards?
[4643.66 → 4644.82] You need to have them all in that.
[4644.94 → 4645.02] Oh,
[4645.04 → 4645.62] there's shiny Pokémon.
[4645.62 → 4646.76] Don't forget you need digital.
[4646.92 → 4648.88] Do you need digital cards for the digital game?
[4648.94 → 4649.94] So you can play it online.
[4650.42 → 4651.88] Don't forget about all the collectibles.
[4651.98 → 4652.08] Well,
[4652.08 → 4653.26] you're going to have all of those too.
[4653.32 → 4653.48] I mean,
[4653.48 → 4659.76] the whole thing is just designed to exploit people who just compulsively need to collect things.
[4659.92 → 4659.94] Right.
[4659.94 → 4661.94] So it's certain to a certain degree.
[4662.56 → 4665.58] You should want that because that means there's more content,
[4665.58 → 4669.68] but you just got to not be obsessive about the content.
[4669.90 → 4670.50] Oh my God.
[4670.82 → 4671.46] Listen to this guy.
[4671.52 → 4672.88] You just got to not be obsessive.
[4672.98 → 4674.54] Do you have any idea who you're talking to?
[4676.32 → 4677.02] I don't know.
[4677.04 → 4679.54] These are people who are so into computers that they are now,
[4679.54 → 4680.64] hold on one second.
[4680.80 → 4682.34] There's this thing called shadow rates.
[4682.34 → 4688.08] They are an hour and 23 minutes into this podcast about nothing.
[4689.40 → 4691.12] What have we even talked about?
[4691.20 → 4691.30] Yeah,
[4691.32 → 4692.42] but we're second monitor.
[4693.26 → 4694.20] They're not obsessed.
[4694.30 → 4694.56] Hold on.
[4694.62 → 4695.40] We're second monitor.
[4695.40 → 4696.78] Let's find out what monitor we're on.
[4696.84 → 4697.74] I'm putting up a poll.
[4697.98 → 4699.44] You got to include third as well.
[4699.56 → 4700.42] You're on my fourth.
[4700.84 → 4701.16] Fourth.
[4701.38 → 4701.62] Yeah,
[4701.62 → 4702.62] but we got,
[4702.62 → 4703.74] we got to stop it somewhere.
[4704.22 → 4704.90] I do need,
[4704.98 → 4705.56] I do need more.
[4705.66 → 4706.68] We still have to talk about that.
[4706.80 → 4707.72] Oh my goodness.
[4708.52 → 4711.10] We'll get you one of those 55-inch TVs and just divide it up.
[4711.88 → 4712.10] No,
[4712.14 → 4712.62] that doesn't work.
[4712.68 → 4714.54] I did that at home, and it's terrible for productivity.
[4714.68 → 4715.74] I miss multiple monitors.
[4715.94 → 4716.10] Yeah.
[4716.18 → 4717.10] Multiple monitors are great.
[4717.28 → 4717.86] So good.
[4718.12 → 4718.66] Two minute poll.
[4718.74 → 4719.08] Here we go.
[4719.14 → 4719.40] All right,
[4719.46 → 4719.60] Luke,
[4719.68 → 4720.04] carry on.
[4720.40 → 4720.62] Okay.
[4720.64 → 4721.98] So this is going to be nothing to you,
[4722.02 → 4722.44] but there's a
[4722.50 → 4724.28] there's a thing in the game called shadow rates.
[4724.28 → 4727.42] And in just leaves.
[4727.54 → 4727.66] Well,
[4727.68 → 4728.36] it's nothing to me.
[4728.36 → 4729.10] I was going to get a snack.
[4729.20 → 4729.70] That works.
[4729.80 → 4730.54] I can talk to them.
[4730.54 → 4730.70] No,
[4730.82 → 4732.90] I'm actually kidding.
[4733.58 → 4735.00] So over the pandemic,
[4735.00 → 4736.46] I quit playing over the pandemic.
[4736.46 → 4738.64] Cause the reason I would play it was to go outside,
[4738.64 → 4740.42] but over the pandemic,
[4740.42 → 4742.60] they added something called a remote raid pass.
[4743.10 → 4744.22] You wanted to do a raid.
[4744.32 → 4745.32] You could buy,
[4745.44 → 4747.38] because I don't think there was any opportunity to get them for free.
[4747.42 → 4748.84] Maybe there was at some point there isn't now.
[4748.96 → 4750.92] You could buy a remote raid pass.
[4751.02 → 4751.10] Sure.
[4751.18 → 4751.88] But can,
[4751.96 → 4752.10] sorry,
[4752.16 → 4752.96] can I interrupt for a second?
[4752.96 → 4755.20] What if I wanted to catch something other than a bug type?
[4759.84 → 4760.20] Well,
[4760.36 → 4761.48] raid wouldn't be very effective.
[4761.70 → 4762.34] It's a bear.
[4765.60 → 4766.00] Actually,
[4766.20 → 4767.50] I have to applaud you for that.
[4767.58 → 4768.20] It's very good.
[4768.46 → 4769.96] I wasn't sure where you're going.
[4770.06 → 4770.88] That was pretty good.
[4771.10 → 4771.80] That was pretty good.
[4771.86 → 4774.18] Raid is a brand of insecticide here in North America.
[4774.18 → 4775.40] If it doesn't exist elsewhere.
[4775.54 → 4775.68] Yeah.
[4775.88 → 4776.08] Yeah.
[4776.72 → 4780.52] Raid is usually for more rare types of Pokémon.
[4780.52 → 4784.32] I think the most commonly done one by at least groups of people would be legendary raids,
[4784.40 → 4785.16] which are the harder ones.
[4786.26 → 4787.98] They introduced these remote raid passes,
[4787.98 → 4790.18] so you wouldn't have to go outside in order to raid.
[4790.34 → 4791.04] A cool idea.
[4791.50 → 4793.72] We're actually primarily on primary monitors.
[4794.30 → 4794.58] Just,
[4794.70 → 4795.46] just saying.
[4795.58 → 4795.76] Wow.
[4796.32 → 4796.72] 45%.
[4796.72 → 4798.50] That's the float plane people though.
[4799.02 → 4799.24] Yeah.
[4799.24 → 4799.64] So what?
[4799.74 → 4801.28] They said they all use Firefox.
[4803.98 → 4809.34] Why don't you make this point that you are apparently going to make it eventually?
[4809.34 → 4809.74] Okay.
[4811.32 → 4811.76] Oh,
[4813.90 → 4814.90] I just poked that hive.
[4814.90 → 4820.64] Can you not antagonize our most loyal,
[4820.88 → 4822.74] diehard community members,
[4822.90 → 4823.10] please?
[4823.52 → 4824.06] So there's,
[4824.14 → 4825.72] there are these things called remote raid passes.
[4825.96 → 4827.48] Really cool idea during the pandemic.
[4827.72 → 4828.70] They still exist.
[4828.80 → 4829.50] Whatever sounds good.
[4829.64 → 4832.32] People are really pissed that you can't do more of them per day.
[4832.52 → 4832.78] Right.
[4832.86 → 4833.16] Raids.
[4833.74 → 4834.32] Remote raids.
[4834.56 → 4835.14] Remote raids.
[4835.26 → 4836.52] You can do as many local raids as you want.
[4836.62 → 4836.78] Oh,
[4836.84 → 4836.96] okay.
[4837.00 → 4838.86] But you have to actually get off your chair.
[4839.18 → 4839.30] Yeah.
[4839.36 → 4839.88] And go there.
[4840.26 → 4844.62] I heard a lot of them are like churches and stuff now or something like a lot of locations
[4844.62 → 4845.24] or gyms.
[4846.30 → 4846.66] Gyms.
[4846.78 → 4846.94] Yeah.
[4846.96 → 4850.18] Like churches have embraced like the whole Pokémon gym thing.
[4850.30 → 4851.36] So that people will go to them.
[4851.54 → 4851.74] Sure.
[4851.90 → 4852.14] Anyway,
[4852.14 → 4853.92] that's a whole probably separate conversation.
[4854.12 → 4854.36] Yeah.
[4854.50 → 4854.72] Any,
[4855.06 → 4858.82] I doubt it works to be honest because people show up for like a few minutes and leave.
[4858.82 → 4859.34] They don't really,
[4859.60 → 4859.96] anyway,
[4860.04 → 4860.28] whatever.
[4861.60 → 4862.86] But shadow raids,
[4863.44 → 4863.64] you,
[4864.06 → 4865.28] which have a certain type of Pokémon,
[4865.38 → 4865.78] don't worry about it.
[4865.80 → 4866.10] It doesn't matter.
[4866.28 → 4867.90] You can't remotely raid into them.
[4867.90 → 4870.10] And shadow raids,
[4870.42 → 4871.70] shadow legendarily.
[4871.88 → 4875.48] So like a shadow Zapdos is only going to show up on the weekend.
[4876.56 → 4877.64] They can't see it.
[4877.70 → 4878.94] They have to move you and me.
[4879.12 → 4880.74] Luke created a poll called.
[4880.74 → 4881.20] I did not.
[4881.70 → 4882.72] Dan did this.
[4882.86 → 4883.26] Dan,
[4883.92 → 4884.44] why?
[4884.74 → 4886.46] They've kept it perfectly neutral.
[4886.58 → 4887.02] His poll.
[4887.08 → 4888.16] I respect that a lot.
[4888.26 → 4888.62] Good job,
[4888.70 → 4888.88] guys.
[4888.96 → 4890.14] That's actually amazing.
[4890.26 → 4890.66] It's 50,
[4890.72 → 4891.00] 50.
[4891.76 → 4892.98] His poll here is,
[4893.08 → 4894.98] is everyone on float plane a liar?
[4895.88 → 4896.32] Yes.
[4896.82 → 4897.22] Yes.
[4897.22 → 4898.20] Luke had,
[4898.26 → 4899.74] Luke had the polls closed.
[4899.90 → 4901.46] That was for him more than anything.
[4901.64 → 4902.64] So sorry about that.
[4906.16 → 4909.60] That's where I find that amazingly entertaining that it's 50,
[4909.66 → 4909.96] 50.
[4910.58 → 4911.16] Good job,
[4911.22 → 4911.50] float plane.
[4912.12 → 4912.92] That's impressive.
[4913.32 → 4914.50] I'm genuinely impressed.
[4914.82 → 4915.30] You guys are,
[4915.42 → 4916.10] you guys are great.
[4916.30 → 4918.08] These shadow legendary raids,
[4918.18 → 4919.20] they only happen on weekends.
[4919.38 → 4920.34] You can't remotely raid,
[4920.68 → 4922.18] you can't remotely raid pass into them.
[4922.36 → 4922.68] Got it.
[4922.68 → 4928.62] That has created this emergent behaviour where I will try to organize with people to meet up on the weekend.
[4928.84 → 4929.02] Yeah.
[4929.10 → 4930.64] And go walk around and do these raids.
[4930.66 → 4930.80] Right.
[4930.84 → 4931.14] So you're,
[4931.26 → 4932.36] so you imagine that.
[4932.36 → 4933.56] That's really cool.
[4933.56 → 4934.74] So you're the true Scotsman.
[4934.98 → 4935.56] That's fantastic.
[4936.24 → 4937.56] But no one else is a true Scotsman.
[4937.56 → 4939.00] Exactly what I want.
[4939.26 → 4942.70] And people are mad because they want to be able to remote raid pass into shadow raids.
[4942.74 → 4943.06] And I'm like,
[4943.20 → 4943.56] actually,
[4943.56 → 4945.92] I would rather if we couldn't.
[4946.88 → 4948.00] Because now,
[4948.46 → 4949.80] if people want this thing,
[4949.96 → 4951.36] if people are going to go catch them all,
[4951.60 → 4953.42] then they're going to have to come out for a walk.
[4953.78 → 4954.12] Right.
[4954.24 → 4954.56] Okay.
[4954.90 → 4955.38] So like,
[4955.44 → 4958.50] I have differing opinions to the majority of the community,
[4958.64 → 4959.50] which is fine.
[4959.78 → 4962.04] They can want to play the game however they want to play the game.
[4962.08 → 4962.74] That's no problem.
[4963.94 → 4967.34] But I play Pokémon Go for a reason that I don't think most people do.
[4967.88 → 4968.26] Right.
[4969.68 → 4972.56] I play it because like this weekend,
[4972.68 → 4973.76] there's a thing going on,
[4973.86 → 4976.90] and I'm probably going to walk like 15 plus kilometres in a day.
[4977.40 → 4978.30] And that's great.
[4978.30 → 4983.12] Because getting myself to do that without a gamified motivation is harder.
[4983.12 → 4987.38] But now I'm like excited to go walk a crazy amount of kilometres.
[4987.62 → 4991.36] Some people are just going to put a bunch of lures down and sit on their butt for the entire event.
[4992.10 → 4993.60] And that will be very effective.
[4993.82 → 4994.38] But I don't care.
[4994.42 → 4994.54] Well,
[4994.54 → 4997.62] they can just be kind of like the NPCs in that region.
[4997.90 → 4998.08] Yeah.
[4998.76 → 5003.24] Like the trainers that are just like walking back and forth between two points.
[5003.40 → 5003.76] And they're like,
[5003.80 → 5004.52] I like bug Pokémon.
[5004.52 → 5005.02] In the grass.
[5005.10 → 5005.70] Do you want to battle?
[5007.70 → 5009.14] That would be fantastic.
[5010.34 → 5011.62] If you don't move enough,
[5011.70 → 5012.92] you should turn into an NPC.
[5013.38 → 5014.82] And when people encounter you,
[5014.90 → 5016.18] you should have to battle or something.
[5016.76 → 5017.92] Is that a thing?
[5018.00 → 5018.94] Is that a mechanic they have?
[5018.98 → 5019.40] Because if not,
[5019.46 → 5020.18] they totally should.
[5020.20 → 5020.90] It's pretty sweet though.
[5020.90 → 5021.72] Like if you don't move,
[5021.80 → 5022.36] you're just like,
[5022.40 → 5024.42] you're one of the people on like route six or whatever.
[5024.42 → 5026.30] It puts like a vision cone in front of you.
[5026.62 → 5028.24] Like anyone that walks in front,
[5028.32 → 5029.42] it challenges them to battle.
[5031.80 → 5032.30] Someone said,
[5032.38 → 5032.72] I agree,
[5032.80 → 5033.72] but as a wheelchair user,
[5033.80 → 5034.98] there needs to be a wheelchair mode.
[5035.70 → 5037.58] Wouldn't you just wheelchair around?
[5038.02 → 5038.34] Well,
[5038.34 → 5038.88] it depends.
[5039.10 → 5040.62] Not everywhere is wheelchair accessible.
[5041.30 → 5041.42] Like,
[5041.48 → 5041.64] man,
[5041.72 → 5041.96] it's,
[5042.36 → 5042.82] it is.
[5043.18 → 5043.40] That's fair.
[5043.58 → 5047.18] Where I go to every time I do one of these is very wheelchair accessible.
[5047.32 → 5048.02] I had a
[5048.06 → 5048.36] um,
[5048.36 → 5050.86] I had a pretty bad knee injury a number of years ago.
[5050.86 → 5051.92] But I understand not everywhere is.
[5052.04 → 5055.08] Such that like walking was actually really hard.
[5055.32 → 5057.20] And it was shocking.
[5057.72 → 5059.62] Like how hard it is to get around anywhere.
[5059.62 → 5060.86] And I was still on my feet.
[5061.22 → 5062.62] It's crazy.
[5062.62 → 5063.62] Um,
[5063.62 → 5065.12] and the thing is that like,
[5065.44 → 5067.74] as someone who's working on a building right now,
[5067.74 → 5068.72] if you guys missed it,
[5068.76 → 5070.62] we uploaded a video earlier this week,
[5070.66 → 5074.88] outlining the plans for the badminton centre slash land gaming centre.
[5074.88 → 5077.22] As someone who's working on a building right now,
[5077.52 → 5078.02] um,
[5078.54 → 5078.90] I,
[5078.94 → 5082.16] I recognize a lot of the perfect things that are being done in the building
[5082.16 → 5083.84] code to make things more accessible.
[5083.84 → 5086.04] You have to have handy accessible spots.
[5086.04 → 5091.90] You have to have X percentage of handy accessible washroom stalls and sinks and
[5091.90 → 5092.88] all of that kind of stuff.
[5093.22 → 5093.62] Um,
[5093.62 → 5096.46] so you're like your counters have to be such that you can,
[5096.56 → 5098.06] you can roll up to them and use them.
[5098.14 → 5099.46] All that's perfect.
[5099.68 → 5104.46] But what's interesting is that building code just straight up doesn't apply to
[5104.46 → 5105.58] anything that was already built.
[5105.82 → 5109.56] And 98% of everything.
[5109.94 → 5110.36] Actually,
[5110.50 → 5113.76] no 100% of everything is already built like today,
[5113.86 → 5114.36] you know,
[5114.36 → 5118.10] there will be things that exist that will have become that they have been
[5118.10 → 5118.26] built.
[5118.32 → 5121.42] But my point is just that the overwhelming majority of things were built
[5121.42 → 5122.18] before that.
[5122.18 → 5123.38] And the planning was terrible.
[5123.98 → 5124.22] Um,
[5124.22 → 5124.62] so yeah,
[5124.64 → 5124.80] yeah,
[5124.80 → 5125.18] that's a
[5125.30 → 5127.06] that's totally a fair,
[5127.60 → 5128.90] that's totally a fair point.
[5128.90 → 5130.02] And that's something that,
[5130.02 → 5130.32] you know,
[5130.38 → 5131.66] Ni antic should address,
[5131.80 → 5136.90] but I also don't think that that invalidates Luke's point that a lot of
[5136.90 → 5141.72] people are able-bodied and just don't want to go out.
[5141.92 → 5143.84] I would love if there were solutions for that type of stuff.
[5143.84 → 5145.54] I'm not against solutions to that type of stuff.
[5145.66 → 5147.86] I think there are ways to accomplish that.
[5147.96 → 5148.36] Uh,
[5148.36 → 5152.82] like maybe make it that you can invite a maximum amount of people to remote
[5152.82 → 5153.88] rates per day.
[5154.12 → 5156.90] And you have to be a certain level of friends with them because like,
[5156.90 → 5157.40] there's a
[5157.52 → 5157.94] there's a
[5158.14 → 5159.82] if you hadn't stolen my phone,
[5159.90 → 5162.22] I forgot about that until now.
[5162.22 → 5163.08] I knew you would.
[5163.96 → 5164.58] There's a
[5164.66 → 5165.06] there's a
[5165.12 → 5166.32] there are multiple apps.
[5166.38 → 5167.72] There's a ton of different apps that you can use,
[5167.72 → 5168.50] uh,
[5168.52 → 5169.42] to host,
[5169.60 → 5170.18] uh,
[5170.18 → 5171.54] which I'll sometimes do or,
[5171.54 → 5172.52] or to,
[5172.66 → 5174.74] to remote rate in other people's things.
[5174.74 → 5178.14] So the community element is just fully digital now.
[5178.64 → 5179.16] Um,
[5180.02 → 5182.56] I don't know.
[5182.78 → 5183.04] I,
[5183.04 → 5183.24] I,
[5183.24 → 5183.38] I,
[5183.48 → 5187.64] I understand the countering argument because you can play the game more and
[5187.64 → 5187.98] honestly,
[5187.98 → 5191.18] probably enjoy it more and played at a more competitive level and all these
[5191.18 → 5194.02] other types of things and be much more immersed.
[5194.02 → 5197.32] And in the Pokémon Go experience,
[5197.32 → 5198.44] if,
[5198.44 → 5199.02] uh,
[5200.14 → 5203.70] you're able to remote rate roll more, and you're able to catch more things from
[5203.70 → 5204.02] your house.
[5204.02 → 5205.80] Like if your catch radius is bigger,
[5205.90 → 5206.96] so you can get more things from your house,
[5207.12 → 5208.26] all this type of stuff.
[5208.34 → 5209.32] I get that.
[5209.62 → 5214.36] But the reason why I want to play the game personally on a personal level is
[5214.36 → 5216.98] because it gets me outside and moving and more active and,
[5216.98 → 5220.12] and in the sun and all that type of stuff.
[5220.96 → 5221.32] Um,
[5221.84 → 5223.52] my motivation is less about Pokémon.
[5224.02 → 5227.78] It's more about personal health and fitness and wellbeing and stuff like
[5227.78 → 5228.02] that.
[5228.28 → 5234.12] So I like the idea that I don't have to do those things alone.
[5234.94 → 5237.62] And I have genuinely received the response.
[5237.78 → 5238.40] I've been like,
[5238.42 → 5238.50] Oh,
[5238.52 → 5239.44] I want to go do this thing.
[5239.44 → 5239.62] Like,
[5239.64 → 5243.02] let's go to whatever park and walk around and try to do as much as we can.
[5243.12 → 5245.20] I have genuinely received the response of like,
[5245.20 → 5247.50] I'm probably just going to hang out at home.
[5247.60 → 5247.76] I'll,
[5247.76 → 5248.54] I'll remotely rate it.
[5248.60 → 5249.32] And it's like,
[5249.46 → 5249.96] Oh,
[5249.96 → 5252.80] that sucks.
[5252.80 → 5254.02] I don't know,
[5254.42 → 5256.24] but I teach their own,
[5256.28 → 5256.42] right?
[5256.56 → 5259.78] Did we just spend half an hour on the first of the two merch messages we're
[5259.78 → 5260.54] supposed to do right now?
[5260.54 → 5261.88] You didn't even answer the full question.
[5262.10 → 5262.22] Oh,
[5262.30 → 5262.80] what was the question?
[5262.80 → 5263.52] What was the question?
[5263.68 → 5263.94] Also,
[5264.06 → 5265.08] what do you think of how world?
[5265.32 → 5265.48] Oh,
[5265.54 → 5266.04] I haven't played.
[5266.04 → 5267.54] I've played it.
[5268.46 → 5270.84] I hope it's a major wake-up call to Pokémon.
[5270.96 → 5272.86] And that's honestly pretty much my only feeling about it.
[5273.18 → 5273.54] Yeah.
[5273.60 → 5277.94] It's the best Pokémon game that has released in many years.
[5278.08 → 5278.74] It makes,
[5279.00 → 5279.82] what was it called?
[5280.16 → 5281.48] Legend of Arceus or something.
[5281.70 → 5282.22] What was that game?
[5282.32 → 5282.76] I didn't know.
[5282.88 → 5283.82] Whatever it was even called.
[5283.82 → 5285.06] Because it didn't matter at all.
[5285.48 → 5287.28] It makes that game look like a joke.
[5287.70 → 5288.00] Yeah.
[5288.00 → 5288.64] Um,
[5289.24 → 5293.80] and hopefully game freak wakes up and does something with that IP.
[5293.80 → 5298.16] Because it's incredibly frustrating as like a person who does like Pokémon that
[5298.16 → 5299.14] the Pokémon games like,
[5299.30 → 5300.82] I don't know.
[5301.00 → 5301.24] Yeah.
[5301.24 → 5302.62] And it's not like Nintendo is,
[5302.70 → 5302.92] I mean,
[5302.92 → 5303.46] Nintendo,
[5303.70 → 5306.76] Nintendo can be really stuffy and really kind of set in their ways,
[5306.76 → 5310.28] but they can also be kind of edgy and unique and fun.
[5310.34 → 5310.62] And so,
[5310.72 → 5310.84] yeah,
[5310.84 → 5314.40] I don't see why they couldn't do something a little more creative with the
[5314.40 → 5315.04] Pokémon IP.
[5315.18 → 5315.28] I mean,
[5315.30 → 5317.70] you look at like a Super Mario RPG or,
[5317.70 → 5318.32] look at Zelda.
[5319.08 → 5319.36] Yeah,
[5319.56 → 5319.88] sure.
[5320.52 → 5320.72] Yeah.
[5320.84 → 5320.96] Yeah.
[5320.96 → 5322.02] Zelda's been changing,
[5322.36 → 5322.72] evolving,
[5322.96 → 5323.32] improving.
[5323.58 → 5323.72] Yeah.
[5323.74 → 5326.28] How ironic that Pokémon wouldn't evolve.
[5327.54 → 5327.98] Yeah.
[5328.20 → 5328.76] For real though.
[5328.84 → 5329.82] We should do a
[5329.82 → 5330.26] a
[5330.26 → 5332.20] a Super Chat really quick here.
[5332.48 → 5335.62] Someone didn't get the memo and sent a $200 Super Chat.
[5335.78 → 5340.10] That is a perfect way for me to highlight why we don't do Super Chats and
[5340.10 → 5343.08] why we moved away from using this dashboard entirely.
[5343.26 → 5343.84] Check this out.
[5344.56 → 5344.94] Uh,
[5345.38 → 5345.86] Hey,
[5345.96 → 5346.66] love the channel.
[5347.04 → 5347.46] Um,
[5347.46 → 5347.90] Columbus,
[5347.98 → 5349.18] Ohio is getting new Intel chip factory.
[5349.24 → 5349.36] Yeah,
[5349.36 → 5349.98] that's super cool.
[5350.06 → 5353.50] It's a kind of crazy that semiconductor manufacturing is like coming back to
[5353.50 → 5353.96] the States.
[5354.46 → 5355.18] Who to thunk it.
[5355.84 → 5356.24] Anywho,
[5356.36 → 5356.98] look at this.
[5357.56 → 5359.50] I've had people call me out on this and say,
[5359.58 → 5359.80] no,
[5359.86 → 5360.42] Linus lied.
[5360.48 → 5361.52] The dashboard is perfect.
[5362.24 → 5362.62] No,
[5362.98 → 5363.74] Linus didn't lie.
[5363.88 → 5365.16] The dashboard is not perfect.
[5365.92 → 5366.98] That message.
[5367.90 → 5368.30] Okay.
[5368.32 → 5368.46] Hey,
[5368.46 → 5370.42] I can't apparently unselect it.
[5371.12 → 5371.56] Um,
[5371.56 → 5371.98] anywho,
[5372.14 → 5372.68] uh,
[5372.68 → 5373.52] that is not here.
[5374.86 → 5376.10] It's not in.
[5376.10 → 5377.98] What happens if you refresh the viewer activity?
[5378.12 → 5378.26] No,
[5378.32 → 5378.50] it's,
[5378.54 → 5379.02] it's not here.
[5379.28 → 5380.08] Check it out.
[5380.08 → 5388.54] Not there.
[5388.68 → 5390.50] And eventually things do fall off.
[5390.58 → 5390.70] Yeah,
[5390.70 → 5391.24] that will go away.
[5391.36 → 5393.74] That's only still there because it's such a big donation.
[5394.12 → 5398.70] That's the bug that made us develop merch messages in the first place.
[5399.36 → 5400.68] How many years ago was that?
[5401.18 → 5401.44] Two,
[5401.78 → 5402.02] three,
[5402.34 → 5403.22] somewhere around there.
[5403.26 → 5403.36] Yeah.
[5403.36 → 5403.76] It's been a while.
[5403.78 → 5406.60] It's still not fixed.
[5407.08 → 5408.78] How is that even possible?
[5409.20 → 5409.42] Like,
[5409.48 → 5410.24] tell me something.
[5410.52 → 5415.88] How complicated is the database that needs to store these text inputs?
[5416.74 → 5417.90] These text entries?
[5418.60 → 5418.68] Like,
[5418.78 → 5419.12] is this,
[5419.18 → 5421.50] is this more complicated than an Excel sheet?
[5421.58 → 5422.28] Help me out here.
[5422.28 → 5422.56] there.
[5422.64 → 5422.92] Well,
[5423.12 → 5423.88] yeah.
[5424.06 → 5424.28] No,
[5424.38 → 5424.70] no,
[5424.76 → 5426.20] but really YouTube scale,
[5426.38 → 5426.52] Ada,
[5426.56 → 5426.72] Ada,
[5426.76 → 5426.92] Ada,
[5426.98 → 5427.14] Ada,
[5427.24 → 5428.62] but it shouldn't be a big deal.
[5428.70 → 5430.36] It has to store a username and amount,
[5430.48 → 5432.20] a timestamp and a flipping.
[5432.50 → 5434.52] It should not be a big deal for YouTube to do.
[5434.84 → 5437.08] It doesn't even have to store image.
[5437.60 → 5438.38] Anything like it's,
[5438.50 → 5440.24] are you kidding me?
[5442.40 → 5443.04] So anyway,
[5443.16 → 5443.64] that's why.
[5445.18 → 5446.74] And as for why I don't turn them off,
[5446.78 → 5448.74] if people want badly enough to do things wrong,
[5448.78 → 5449.78] then I say power to them.
[5450.94 → 5451.34] Yeah.
[5452.28 → 5453.24] All right,
[5453.28 → 5453.46] Dan,
[5453.62 → 5454.64] hit us with another merch message.
[5454.88 → 5455.00] Sure.
[5455.58 → 5455.76] Hi,
[5455.84 → 5456.02] Dan,
[5456.10 → 5456.24] Luke,
[5456.32 → 5457.10] and Linus too,
[5457.22 → 5457.72] I guess.
[5458.16 → 5463.64] What industry have you been most surprised by the amount or kinds of technology that they use?
[5466.50 → 5466.80] Man,
[5466.86 → 5467.24] just about,
[5467.34 → 5467.64] just about.
[5467.76 → 5469.54] I think I'm more surprised by the opposite.
[5470.82 → 5470.98] Oh,
[5471.02 → 5472.44] ones that don't use technology?
[5472.62 → 5472.78] Or,
[5472.78 → 5473.70] or that like,
[5473.70 → 5473.90] oh,
[5473.90 → 5478.94] they're still running the same computer with serial cables from the like early 90s.
[5479.16 → 5482.02] I remember finding out in like 2010 or something like that,
[5482.16 → 5486.32] that one of our competitors at NCI still used fax to place POs.
[5486.40 → 5486.70] I'm just like,
[5486.72 → 5487.30] what?
[5487.72 → 5487.98] Japan?
[5487.98 → 5488.84] Just email them,
[5488.92 → 5489.08] like,
[5489.14 → 5489.60] obviously.
[5489.86 → 5491.26] I don't know if this is in the doc right now,
[5491.32 → 5496.82] but Japan is dealing with like the fact that a bunch of businesses are still sending the government like floppy disks.
[5497.08 → 5497.26] Yeah.
[5497.26 → 5500.86] Apparently they just changed the legislation that forced that.
[5500.86 → 5507.52] So maybe they can finally move past the floppy diskette after all these years,
[5507.72 → 5508.70] all these decades.
[5509.38 → 5511.18] I will say being in Japan,
[5511.38 → 5518.40] a lot of the more tactile things still being around is kind of nice.
[5518.62 → 5520.72] More things tend to have physical buttons.
[5522.48 → 5527.24] More things tend to have moving physical components involved that don't seem like they're going to be able to do.
[5527.26 → 5527.84] break often.
[5528.12 → 5529.26] Did I ever tell the story?
[5529.26 → 5530.18] It's actually like pretty cool.
[5530.22 → 5533.14] About getting the insurance and registration taken care of for my car?
[5534.44 → 5534.66] Oh,
[5534.74 → 5534.90] yeah.
[5534.96 → 5538.26] And how like not only did they require fax,
[5539.16 → 5539.24] like,
[5539.26 → 5539.52] like,
[5539.64 → 5540.12] like,
[5540.20 → 5541.34] like signed fax,
[5541.78 → 5543.28] like a signed fax,
[5543.28 → 5553.38] but they actually required the original form for like the business registration for the dealer to be mailed to the insurance broker in order to register the car.
[5553.38 → 5554.30] Because some,
[5554.30 → 5557.40] some ICBC is our insurance provider in BC.
[5557.54 → 5559.44] They have a monopoly because that's legal for some reason.
[5559.92 → 5564.08] If anyone was looking for a platform to get elected on in BC,
[5564.08 → 5567.30] it would be to abolish ICBC's monopoly.
[5567.30 → 5570.62] And then instant you're elected just in case anyone's wondering.
[5570.84 → 5570.94] Anyway,
[5570.98 → 5571.72] the point is,
[5571.72 → 5573.50] yeah,
[5573.56 → 5576.76] the fact that even a fax wasn't considered good enough.
[5576.86 → 5577.28] How is it?
[5577.38 → 5577.82] How is it?
[5577.96 → 5579.86] How is anything more than an email required?
[5579.94 → 5582.16] I just am sort of baffled by that.
[5583.22 → 5583.96] And then,
[5584.08 → 5584.24] yeah,
[5584.24 → 5587.80] the fact that things have to be physically present for signatures always blows me away.
[5588.22 → 5588.50] Hey,
[5588.62 → 5588.82] the
[5588.82 → 5592.16] the superb owl is coming up really soon.
[5592.40 → 5593.10] Sports tech is,
[5593.14 → 5593.98] is really cool.
[5594.36 → 5595.62] Sports tech is really cool,
[5595.68 → 5596.90] especially in the NFL,
[5597.06 → 5597.30] actually.
[5597.30 → 5597.66] Yeah.
[5597.86 → 5598.14] Like,
[5598.24 → 5598.48] I mean,
[5598.68 → 5599.46] have you seen how,
[5599.60 → 5601.24] have you watched an NHL game recently?
[5601.48 → 5601.86] Hockey game?
[5602.46 → 5602.72] No.
[5604.48 → 5605.60] I heard we're doing well,
[5605.72 → 5606.00] but no.
[5606.14 → 5609.30] Remember how bad those digitally superimposed,
[5610.12 → 5610.48] uh,
[5610.48 → 5611.20] boards ads?
[5611.20 → 5611.52] Yeah,
[5611.52 → 5611.64] they're insane now.
[5611.72 → 5612.62] They're perfect now.
[5612.62 → 5613.60] I have seen that.
[5613.78 → 5614.66] I have seen that.
[5614.70 → 5616.26] They like move and stuff and,
[5616.26 → 5617.26] yeah.
[5618.34 → 5619.00] Looks perfect.
[5619.20 → 5619.46] Yeah.
[5619.98 → 5620.42] Yeah.
[5621.08 → 5621.60] Um,
[5621.76 → 5622.02] but,
[5622.08 → 5622.88] but genuinely,
[5623.16 → 5623.52] uh,
[5623.56 → 5624.12] if you're,
[5624.18 → 5625.44] if you're into tech at all,
[5625.50 → 5626.86] even if you hate sports,
[5626.86 → 5630.56] if you look into the tech that the NFL uses,
[5630.56 → 5631.52] um,
[5631.70 → 5632.08] for,
[5632.22 → 5632.96] for NFL games,
[5632.96 → 5633.36] it's,
[5633.60 → 5636.18] it's really pretty wild.
[5636.18 → 5638.68] That is actually an extremely tech forward,
[5638.68 → 5639.62] uh,
[5639.62 → 5639.92] uh,
[5639.92 → 5640.42] organization.
[5640.64 → 5641.10] Yep.
[5641.32 → 5641.54] Yeah.
[5642.22 → 5644.34] You wouldn't know it from all the NFL,
[5644.34 → 5644.86] uh,
[5644.88 → 5645.88] co-branded merchandise.
[5646.24 → 5648.70] We did that video where we bought sports tech.
[5648.84 → 5650.42] It's the cheapest,
[5650.72 → 5651.62] cheapest.
[5651.76 → 5652.08] Absolutely.
[5652.34 → 5654.78] Of AliExpress garbage with a silk-screened logo on it.
[5654.82 → 5655.24] It was amazing.
[5655.34 → 5655.58] Yeah.
[5655.58 → 5659.20] But when it comes to their games and like how they do ref and all this other kind of stuff,
[5659.20 → 5660.04] really impressive.
[5662.28 → 5662.60] Yeah.
[5662.66 → 5663.72] Hawkeye is super cool.
[5664.52 → 5666.90] I might have some news about Hawkeye for you.
[5667.06 → 5667.40] Oh,
[5667.94 → 5668.18] okay.
[5668.18 → 5668.52] Well here,
[5668.60 → 5670.20] why don't I first explain what Hawkeye is?
[5670.22 → 5671.30] It's what they use for tennis,
[5671.58 → 5671.98] badminton.
[5672.32 → 5672.72] Oh yeah.
[5672.72 → 5672.92] Yeah.
[5673.22 → 5673.46] Um,
[5673.46 → 5673.92] to,
[5674.02 → 5675.48] to track the projectile.
[5675.60 → 5677.02] And I didn't realize this,
[5677.12 → 5685.02] but it's not actually that the camera array is seeing where the ball landed or where the shuttle landed.
[5685.02 → 5691.54] It's that it is calculating based on the initial trajectory where it will go.
[5691.72 → 5701.92] So Hawkeye might not actually always be right because this is less true of a tennis ball probably where you could do a
[5701.92 → 5709.62] like a NASA style to compute thing where you have Hawkeye try to figure it out, and you have something that watches it and tries to figure it out.
[5709.62 → 5709.64] Well,
[5709.64 → 5711.14] I think they do have that.
[5711.58 → 5711.94] Okay.
[5711.94 → 5716.34] But it has to make a decision, and it is the final call.
[5717.12 → 5717.70] Hawkeye is?
[5717.80 → 5717.98] Yeah.
[5718.52 → 5718.76] If,
[5718.92 → 5721.02] cause Hawkeye only comes out at least in badminton.
[5721.12 → 5722.10] I don't know how it works in tennis.
[5722.44 → 5722.68] Uh,
[5722.68 → 5725.70] in badminton Hawkeye only comes out in the event of a challenge.
[5725.94 → 5727.02] So they have,
[5727.02 → 5727.52] uh,
[5728.08 → 5729.74] E Rob 18 full plane chat.
[5729.88 → 5731.40] I don't necessarily know how true this is,
[5731.40 → 5734.54] but I've worked with Hawkeye at a grand slam tennis tournament.
[5734.54 → 5736.10] It's not 100%.
[5736.10 → 5736.34] Yeah.
[5736.46 → 5737.74] They use a lot of cameras.
[5738.38 → 5740.44] I know they use a lot of cameras.
[5740.74 → 5741.26] Uh,
[5741.30 → 5743.22] it's like in the dozens,
[5743.22 → 5744.30] if I recall correctly,
[5744.30 → 5746.00] like it's a flipping ton of them.
[5746.10 → 5746.54] Uh,
[5746.58 → 5748.04] but aside from the cameras,
[5748.16 → 5749.70] my understanding and Hey,
[5749.82 → 5750.94] feel free to correct me.
[5751.00 → 5760.96] My understanding is that the cameras are more about feeding data into the computational engine that decides where it landed because the
[5760.96 → 5764.24] the point of contact is so much smaller.
[5764.54 → 5766.20] Then the actual projectile.
[5766.28 → 5768.12] Think about it for a tennis ball.
[5768.44 → 5768.50] Absolutely.
[5768.66 → 5768.82] Yeah.
[5769.04 → 5772.18] Only the part that mushes touched the court.
[5772.66 → 5777.26] And if the edge of the ball that doesn't mush onto the ground is over the line,
[5777.38 → 5777.48] well,
[5777.50 → 5778.28] that doesn't count.
[5778.28 → 5779.52] So no camera,
[5779.94 → 5787.20] unless it was positioned at ground level is going to actually see how much that ball compressed,
[5787.20 → 5788.52] or in the case of a shuttle,
[5788.62 → 5789.72] how much the
[5789.80 → 5790.12] uh,
[5790.20 → 5790.36] the
[5790.54 → 5792.36] how much the cork compressed as it hit the ground.
[5792.36 → 5795.40] So they cannot see where it landed.
[5795.64 → 5798.64] They just have to have a pretty good idea of where it landed.
[5798.74 → 5799.20] And in tennis,
[5799.28 → 5800.64] I could see this being less of a problem,
[5800.64 → 5802.02] but in badminton,
[5802.74 → 5803.88] the shuttle is fragile.
[5803.88 → 5807.84] So if you knock a feather off of it with a
[5807.84 → 5810.12] with a really powerful smash or something like that,
[5810.12 → 5815.38] its trajectory may not be as anticipated.
[5816.14 → 5816.56] Um,
[5817.72 → 5818.04] man,
[5818.38 → 5820.30] sports projectiles are a fun rabbit hole.
[5820.70 → 5820.92] Oh yeah.
[5820.96 → 5822.58] Have you ever watched a baseball get made?
[5823.30 → 5823.60] Yeah.
[5823.60 → 5828.08] They apparently like tried to cost them down and make it,
[5828.14 → 5830.56] make it like machine sewn or something.
[5830.66 → 5831.50] And they were like,
[5831.70 → 5831.84] no,
[5831.88 → 5832.52] this doesn't work.
[5832.58 → 5833.60] So they're hand sewn.
[5834.06 → 5837.58] Like every single baseball that the players are just so casual,
[5837.74 → 5839.14] just like Huck it to the fans,
[5839.22 → 5839.78] which they should.
[5839.96 → 5842.12] That's a part of the experience of the ball game.
[5842.50 → 5844.92] It's like handcrafted.
[5845.58 → 5845.98] What?
[5846.24 → 5848.34] What's that thing about like badminton shuttles too,
[5849.02 → 5849.38] man,
[5849.78 → 5851.68] badminton shuttle manufacturing is wild.
[5851.68 → 5853.74] The fact that they only cost like,
[5853.74 → 5854.82] uh,
[5854.94 → 5862.80] about a dollar 50 wholesale us is mind-blowing to me.
[5864.82 → 5865.34] Yeah.
[5865.54 → 5866.92] Baseball rubbing mud.
[5867.32 → 5867.84] Anyway,
[5868.04 → 5868.34] uh,
[5868.34 → 5868.58] Dan,
[5868.70 → 5869.54] tell us about Hawkeye.
[5870.10 → 5870.36] Yeah.
[5870.38 → 5873.02] So we had some perfect feedback after,
[5873.02 → 5873.60] uh,
[5873.60 → 5876.58] the badminton centre video came out, and some people have been recommending a
[5876.58 → 5877.78] bunch of equipment,
[5877.88 → 5878.78] especially for the audio,
[5878.78 → 5881.00] like something like QUAYS came up a lot.
[5881.00 → 5881.88] Um,
[5881.88 → 5886.72] and so I did some digging with Matt and apparently QUAYS has a lot of
[5886.72 → 5891.34] partnerships with Intel and Dell and then also with Sony.
[5891.98 → 5897.32] And so apparently Sony also works intensely with Hawkeye.
[5897.78 → 5900.00] And we may,
[5900.78 → 5902.34] this is sounding really expensive.
[5902.78 → 5905.68] We may be able to get a Hawkeye system.
[5906.12 → 5906.48] What?
[5906.48 → 5907.32] Maybe.
[5907.86 → 5908.22] Maybe.
[5908.82 → 5909.28] We'll see.
[5909.48 → 5910.16] There might be,
[5910.24 → 5912.52] there might be some major partnership stuff,
[5912.64 → 5913.00] but we'll,
[5913.10 → 5913.74] we'll have to see.
[5913.90 → 5914.46] How much Dan?
[5914.60 → 5915.10] I don't know,
[5915.66 → 5917.84] but like full Sony,
[5918.36 → 5920.58] full Sony badminton centre build out.
[5921.08 → 5921.50] Um,
[5922.84 → 5928.38] but if you could have,
[5928.52 → 5930.60] if you could have a Hawkeye system,
[5930.60 → 5933.28] uh,
[5933.56 → 5935.44] okay,
[5935.44 → 5937.88] like just,
[5937.98 → 5940.94] it would be installed, and it would be permanent.
[5940.94 → 5942.12] It would be yours.
[5942.12 → 5944.44] Cause generally you rent them just for,
[5944.50 → 5945.16] just for people in the audience.
[5945.16 → 5945.26] Yeah,
[5945.26 → 5946.66] that's my understanding anyway.
[5946.86 → 5947.70] Just for people in the audience.
[5947.80 → 5949.72] We do a Hawkeye video and then,
[5949.82 → 5950.06] I mean,
[5950.12 → 5950.50] I'm dumb.
[5950.92 → 5951.90] We do a Hawkeye video.
[5952.00 → 5953.18] We explain the system.
[5953.36 → 5953.72] I am.
[5953.80 → 5954.84] We do a full build out.
[5955.04 → 5955.90] I am fascinated by Hawkeye.
[5955.98 → 5956.78] Not only is it down.
[5956.78 → 5957.28] It is so cool.
[5957.38 → 5958.60] That would be a sick video.
[5958.60 → 5960.40] It would be an incredible video.
[5960.78 → 5961.12] And then,
[5961.20 → 5961.40] you know,
[5961.44 → 5963.42] we put that in with the QUAYS system.
[5963.42 → 5964.60] Because they've got some really amazing,
[5964.64 → 5966.36] they're all based on like Dell servers.
[5966.62 → 5967.44] What is QUAYS?
[5967.58 → 5972.16] QUAYS is sort of like the same audio management system that we're planning to put in.
[5972.22 → 5972.44] Okay.
[5972.52 → 5972.94] Like Dante.
[5973.46 → 5973.68] Yeah,
[5973.72 → 5975.02] but it works with Dante.
[5975.18 → 5977.06] Like there's a controller box.
[5977.28 → 5977.72] Um,
[5978.22 → 5981.46] and all of them are kind of in the same kind of integration thing.
[5981.46 → 5981.98] They've got some,
[5982.54 → 5982.88] uh,
[5982.88 → 5984.58] and then they're also partnered with Sony.
[5984.74 → 5988.10] So you know how we're going to have our TVs all over the lobby.
[5988.32 → 5988.46] Yeah.
[5988.52 → 5988.72] Yeah.
[5988.84 → 5992.82] So QUAYS actually has a partnership with Sony because the Sony,
[5993.38 → 5995.16] like professional display TVs,
[5995.42 → 5997.16] have a QUAYS integration.
[5997.72 → 6002.66] So all the media and everything can be controlled under the same banner in the same system.
[6002.72 → 6002.84] Okay.
[6002.84 → 6005.02] So we'd really need to change like a lot of stuff.
[6005.14 → 6005.40] Well,
[6005.46 → 6005.94] we'll see.
[6006.10 → 6008.04] But it might be worth it.
[6008.16 → 6011.40] I was just planning to buy cheap TCLs and then replace them when they,
[6011.40 → 6011.88] burn out.
[6012.26 → 6012.50] Yeah.
[6012.56 → 6013.18] Like that was my,
[6013.24 → 6015.44] and put USB sticks in them with a looping video.
[6015.52 → 6017.10] Like that was actually the plan.
[6017.20 → 6018.44] It was minimum viable product.
[6018.54 → 6018.62] Well,
[6018.64 → 6018.86] I mean,
[6018.88 → 6019.26] all of it,
[6019.32 → 6021.48] all of it was designed under minimum viable product.
[6021.80 → 6024.52] except the facility could easily accommodate,
[6024.52 → 6026.74] accommodate what Dan's talking about.
[6026.92 → 6027.08] So we,
[6027.36 → 6027.56] yeah,
[6027.56 → 6027.84] yeah,
[6027.84 → 6027.94] yeah,
[6027.94 → 6027.96] yeah.
[6027.96 → 6028.42] Yeah.
[6029.18 → 6029.42] Sorry.
[6029.60 → 6030.04] So,
[6030.04 → 6031.66] so basically what we did,
[6031.74 → 6033.90] so just to give you guys a bit more context here,
[6033.90 → 6038.18] is we built amazing bones.
[6038.60 → 6038.84] Yeah.
[6038.98 → 6044.00] And then we planned to put the cheapest possible flesh on them.
[6044.20 → 6044.46] Yeah.
[6044.78 → 6046.86] With the idea being that in the future,
[6046.86 → 6047.60] we would,
[6047.68 → 6050.10] you could upgrade, or you could replace.
[6050.44 → 6055.58] We are decked the fuck out when it comes to networking and power,
[6055.58 → 6057.66] because that's how we roll.
[6057.66 → 6058.98] Those things are annoying to run.
[6059.46 → 6060.30] You run it once.
[6060.40 → 6061.56] You hopefully don't think about it again.
[6061.90 → 6065.54] But knowing that technology only gets cheaper,
[6065.66 → 6066.50] unless it's a GPU,
[6066.98 → 6069.86] we had planned to just go minute,
[6069.98 → 6072.44] bare minimum for the initial implementation.
[6072.44 → 6073.64] And then to kind of see how it goes.
[6073.64 → 6074.00] Which we might need.
[6075.14 → 6075.78] But if we,
[6075.86 → 6076.44] I mean,
[6076.72 → 6077.16] look,
[6077.26 → 6077.64] I'm,
[6077.82 → 6079.28] I'm like,
[6079.32 → 6080.90] I need to take my sweater off excited.
[6080.90 → 6082.16] If we could have a Hawkeye.
[6082.52 → 6082.80] I mean,
[6082.88 → 6083.06] yeah,
[6083.10 → 6084.40] this is kind of what we're working on.
[6084.44 → 6086.04] Cause after that video came out,
[6086.08 → 6087.64] just everybody started jumping on me.
[6087.66 → 6088.06] For,
[6088.22 → 6088.96] for that audio.
[6089.38 → 6090.44] So like,
[6090.58 → 6091.28] it would just hurt,
[6091.68 → 6092.38] but of course,
[6092.44 → 6092.64] right.
[6092.74 → 6093.60] Minimum viable product.
[6093.86 → 6096.20] That's what we need to have.
[6096.60 → 6097.26] Could you come on?
[6097.46 → 6100.20] Can you pick up our car,
[6100.32 → 6100.60] please?
[6100.90 → 6102.60] Dan's plan made complete sense.
[6102.60 → 6106.30] Given the bounds that we gave him to be very clear.
[6106.58 → 6108.88] We could have told him you can spend as much money as you want.
[6108.92 → 6110.16] And he could have come up with a different system.
[6110.36 → 6113.44] My client gave me exacting specifications for that.
[6113.68 → 6113.96] Right.
[6114.22 → 6115.14] So leave Dan alone.
[6115.78 → 6116.26] But,
[6116.26 → 6117.94] but looking into QUAYS,
[6118.04 → 6118.56] like some stuff,
[6118.76 → 6120.38] some good stuff did come out of this.
[6120.50 → 6120.82] And like,
[6121.14 → 6123.14] because we have people with Intel.
[6123.30 → 6127.02] And I think Matt's already reached out to a couple of them because all of them,
[6127.10 → 6130.28] like QUAYS has a heart and the head is Intel.
[6130.38 → 6131.50] And there's Dell as well.
[6131.74 → 6132.20] And God,
[6132.30 → 6134.98] all of them know what we're doing, and they know QUAYS.
[6135.14 → 6136.62] And then this is hilarious.
[6136.62 → 6137.38] And then Sony.
[6137.62 → 6138.72] And then also Hawkeye.
[6138.72 → 6142.62] We need to release preemptive videos for every future project.
[6142.68 → 6145.30] This is why we never build anything reasonable.
[6145.84 → 6146.02] Yeah.
[6146.02 → 6148.18] Because the second we say that's our plan,
[6148.64 → 6153.30] either the community or our industry partners jumps on us.
[6153.30 → 6153.70] They're like,
[6154.02 → 6154.28] what,
[6154.40 → 6154.98] what are you doing?
[6155.04 → 6156.46] That could be 8% better.
[6156.76 → 6157.26] So for,
[6157.26 → 6157.62] for,
[6157.62 → 6157.92] for,
[6157.92 → 6158.36] for me,
[6158.46 → 6158.66] right?
[6158.98 → 6160.62] So the system I designed for your,
[6160.70 → 6163.34] for your minimal viable product cheapest is it we can get going.
[6163.38 → 6163.66] Yeah.
[6163.76 → 6164.50] It can do like,
[6164.58 → 6165.02] I don't know,
[6165.16 → 6165.44] you know,
[6165.44 → 6165.70] maybe,
[6165.80 → 6166.56] maybe 16,
[6166.82 → 6168.84] 16 channels or something like that.
[6168.84 → 6169.40] seems fine.
[6169.40 → 6169.84] The problem,
[6170.04 → 6171.84] probably the problem is that the
[6171.84 → 6177.92] the QUAYS things that have the Dell logo on the front of them that run on the Intel servers are designed for airports.
[6181.66 → 6188.50] So they have 256 independent channels of Dante and like a thousand different individual paging zones.
[6189.08 → 6189.44] Um,
[6189.44 → 6190.26] and so,
[6190.26 → 6190.58] uh,
[6190.58 → 6191.60] some people were asking,
[6191.72 → 6191.86] they're like,
[6191.90 → 6193.30] so how many paging stones do you need?
[6193.36 → 6193.60] And I'm like,
[6193.66 → 6193.82] well,
[6194.30 → 6195.12] the spec got changed.
[6195.20 → 6195.76] So it's one.
[6195.76 → 6198.78] Because we didn't,
[6198.78 → 6200.62] we didn't want to buy a second microphone.
[6200.94 → 6202.52] So we're just going to do one.
[6203.78 → 6204.10] Okay.
[6204.10 → 6204.36] Well,
[6204.42 → 6204.72] I need,
[6204.82 → 6205.86] I need an airport.
[6206.60 → 6206.92] Wait,
[6207.16 → 6207.44] okay.
[6207.50 → 6208.10] You're making me.
[6208.42 → 6208.62] No,
[6208.62 → 6208.92] you did.
[6209.32 → 6209.88] I know,
[6209.96 → 6211.66] but you're making me sound like such a cheap.
[6212.08 → 6212.52] No,
[6212.62 → 6213.46] but it was reasonable.
[6213.62 → 6215.66] It was extremely reasonable.
[6215.74 → 6217.16] Should we tell them what my plan was?
[6217.30 → 6217.40] Dan,
[6217.54 → 6218.54] should we tell them what my plan was?
[6218.54 → 6218.86] Sure.
[6219.00 → 6219.24] Sure.
[6219.36 → 6219.62] Okay.
[6219.86 → 6222.12] So I'm known as the cheap guy.
[6222.22 → 6222.44] Yeah.
[6222.52 → 6225.66] So I threw my plan into the ring, and it got upgraded.
[6225.66 → 6226.94] Cause my plan was rough.
[6227.06 → 6228.54] If you don't want to know what my plan was.
[6228.56 → 6229.02] Not a 610,
[6229.14 → 6230.08] a 5,300.
[6230.62 → 6231.20] It was like,
[6231.30 → 6232.66] I don't remember fully,
[6232.74 → 6236.46] but it was like raspberry pies connected to speakers, and they're all logged into discord.
[6236.66 → 6236.80] Oh,
[6236.86 → 6238.10] I've done a full house install.
[6238.32 → 6239.66] I've done a house install like that.
[6239.82 → 6241.20] You would just move your,
[6241.20 → 6244.82] your talking thing around a discord and then speak it to a mic.
[6244.98 → 6246.52] It was really cheap.
[6246.52 → 6247.86] Move to Jim channel.
[6248.66 → 6252.86] It was very cheap.
[6252.86 → 6253.62] And then,
[6253.82 → 6257.74] so we went from my garbage solution that would cost practically nothing.
[6257.92 → 6258.12] Yeah.
[6258.34 → 6259.72] And we looked at,
[6259.82 → 6261.40] cause there were conversations early on.
[6261.48 → 6263.72] We looked at traditional paging systems as well.
[6263.82 → 6265.30] There were months of discussion,
[6265.42 → 6265.52] right?
[6265.56 → 6265.82] Oh yeah.
[6265.96 → 6266.30] So we,
[6266.30 → 6266.68] we went,
[6266.80 → 6268.08] we went way above.
[6268.48 → 6269.56] We went way below.
[6270.04 → 6272.70] And then we found the pretty reasonable spot in the middle.
[6272.84 → 6276.10] And now we have offers that might result in a big way above again.
[6276.10 → 6282.72] In a facility that we plan to have a grand total of about two people on staff at any given time.
[6283.42 → 6286.02] We're going to have a six person IT team.
[6286.50 → 6287.08] So this is,
[6287.20 → 6287.94] this is the problem.
[6288.06 → 6288.38] I mean,
[6288.52 → 6290.72] that's why I went with that system initially.
[6290.72 → 6292.02] Cause that was one of your requirements.
[6292.02 → 6294.40] It just has to work with no training and be really simple.
[6294.58 → 6294.60] Right.
[6295.52 → 6295.86] Look at him.
[6295.92 → 6296.58] He's freaking out.
[6297.12 → 6298.38] What if you could keep it?
[6298.54 → 6299.58] What if you could keep it Linus?
[6299.82 → 6300.56] What if you had,
[6300.66 → 6302.02] what if you had it at all time?
[6302.06 → 6302.22] I mean,
[6302.22 → 6302.62] you'd have to,
[6302.62 → 6304.92] you might have to put a Sony sticker on something.
[6305.24 → 6306.54] Badminton centre in Canada.
[6307.04 → 6309.22] They also do like Florida ceiling.
[6309.44 → 6310.42] Badminton centre in Canada.
[6310.44 → 6314.06] NATO LED walls that are all also controlled.
[6314.18 → 6315.26] Like its digital signage,
[6315.38 → 6315.50] right?
[6316.28 → 6316.62] Why not?
[6316.94 → 6317.38] No,
[6317.54 → 6319.90] those are like millions of dollars for an installation.
[6320.08 → 6320.44] We're not.
[6320.76 → 6322.74] You could put a Sony banner on the outside.
[6322.76 → 6323.28] I don't even,
[6323.28 → 6324.40] I don't even want to.
[6324.40 → 6327.66] The Sony Linus badminton smash Sony champs centre.
[6327.66 → 6331.62] I don't even want to owe them the fragrance of my soul.
[6331.62 → 6333.98] Who can't read good and want to play badminton.
[6334.50 → 6336.06] Title two at that price.
[6336.78 → 6336.94] No,
[6337.04 → 6337.20] no,
[6337.26 → 6338.40] that would not be reasonable,
[6338.40 → 6341.04] but no full Hawkeye video would be actually incredible.
[6341.04 → 6343.02] Because I don't think there's been any media on it.
[6343.02 → 6344.64] Like really at all.
[6344.76 → 6345.68] There's a little bit,
[6345.74 → 6346.28] but there's,
[6346.34 → 6347.02] it's kind of,
[6347.02 → 6347.50] um,
[6348.22 → 6349.32] it's pretty dry,
[6349.32 → 6351.52] like kind of explainer type stuff.
[6351.64 → 6352.12] Um,
[6352.12 → 6359.88] and I don't think that I've seen anyone who's like an independent media who has gotten a chance to benchmark it.
[6359.88 → 6364.74] Like I would be really interested to put Hawkeye up against.
[6365.16 → 6365.56] Yeah.
[6366.66 → 6367.44] Real eye.
[6368.10 → 6368.82] And like,
[6368.88 → 6369.32] Oh,
[6369.50 → 6370.70] an array of like,
[6370.74 → 6370.92] you know,
[6370.96 → 6372.76] 25 cameras around a spot.
[6373.02 → 6373.54] Oh,
[6374.18 → 6375.12] how good is,
[6375.52 → 6376.70] how good is Hawkeye?
[6376.76 → 6376.98] I mean,
[6377.04 → 6378.86] this is the kind of thing that they're probably looking at going,
[6378.94 → 6381.30] we're not going to,
[6381.32 → 6382.06] we're not going to do that.
[6382.10 → 6383.72] Are we sick though?
[6383.86 → 6384.52] And then that's,
[6384.60 → 6386.16] that would be fascinating to me.
[6386.16 → 6388.12] And then of course that also means that,
[6388.16 → 6388.40] you know,
[6388.46 → 6388.68] the
[6388.68 → 6390.78] the cameras that are going to be recording the
[6390.78 → 6391.26] uh,
[6391.66 → 6392.22] the courts,
[6392.40 → 6394.02] they would probably also be Sony.
[6394.44 → 6394.68] Oh,
[6394.76 → 6394.88] well,
[6394.88 → 6395.18] that's good.
[6395.24 → 6396.90] We have found that Sony one we really liked.
[6396.98 → 6399.60] The only reason I was going to go Panasonic was because it was cheaper.
[6399.78 → 6399.92] Well,
[6399.92 → 6400.76] they're also doing like,
[6400.82 → 6401.22] uh,
[6401.22 → 6402.68] some PTZ cameras,
[6402.78 → 6403.50] PTZ cameras.
[6403.60 → 6403.78] Yeah.
[6404.18 → 6404.54] Uh,
[6404.54 → 6406.02] and tilt zoom for those not familiar.
[6406.02 → 6406.50] So they,
[6406.58 → 6407.92] they are remotely controlled.
[6408.32 → 6408.56] Yeah.
[6408.80 → 6409.24] Uh,
[6409.24 → 6411.52] and a lot of it is in like the
[6411.60 → 6413.02] maybe tracking and stuff as well,
[6413.02 → 6414.54] but I don't think those are going to be super necessary,
[6414.54 → 6415.74] but you know,
[6415.92 → 6417.72] a huge buildup.
[6417.84 → 6418.38] Very exciting.
[6419.04 → 6419.20] Yeah.
[6419.66 → 6421.38] One bit of a downer.
[6421.50 → 6423.56] I saw one comment where someone was like,
[6423.62 → 6423.76] Hey,
[6423.78 → 6425.24] I work with BWF,
[6425.34 → 6425.54] uh,
[6425.54 → 6427.72] which is the badminton world federation or whatever.
[6428.32 → 6428.72] Um,
[6429.00 → 6429.54] one of the
[6429.64 → 6432.42] one of the big mistakes we see a lot of centres making is,
[6432.48 → 6435.08] is not investing properly in the lighting and the
[6435.08 → 6435.80] uh,
[6435.80 → 6437.70] and certain other elements to make it,
[6437.70 → 6438.06] uh,
[6438.10 → 6439.10] BWF standard.
[6439.10 → 6441.90] So we'd love to work with you guys to make it so you could like host
[6441.90 → 6443.26] international tournaments and stuff.
[6443.90 → 6444.26] Um,
[6444.54 → 6448.80] I don't think that's feasible as much as I appreciate the outreach.
[6449.22 → 6449.74] Um,
[6449.84 → 6451.80] because a
[6451.90 → 6454.92] we don't have any kind of,
[6454.92 → 6455.82] um,
[6457.34 → 6457.76] we,
[6457.82 → 6461.30] we don't have any kind of spectator capabilities really.
[6461.60 → 6463.20] Like you could be up in the
[6463.26 → 6463.82] in the lounge,
[6463.86 → 6465.80] but we don't have parking to accommodate if,
[6465.84 → 6466.00] you know,
[6466.04 → 6470.32] hundreds or thousands of people wanted to watch or whatever we could handle
[6470.32 → 6471.20] video.
[6471.20 → 6471.86] But you know,
[6471.86 → 6473.10] part of a sporting event is,
[6473.14 → 6473.92] is the crowd,
[6473.92 → 6474.40] right?
[6474.44 → 6474.98] At least to,
[6475.10 → 6475.72] to a degree.
[6475.88 → 6476.00] Yeah.
[6476.00 → 6477.34] We do have a crowd section though.
[6477.98 → 6479.50] They can all be on treadmills.
[6479.76 → 6480.24] Yeah,
[6480.46 → 6480.96] exactly.
[6481.18 → 6485.70] And then number two is that we don't actually have the
[6485.80 → 6486.20] um,
[6486.98 → 6488.40] we don't actually have a high enough ceiling.
[6489.20 → 6489.68] Oh,
[6490.04 → 6490.30] really?
[6490.44 → 6490.72] Yeah.
[6490.72 → 6492.88] So I'm trying,
[6492.96 → 6494.56] I'm trying to find it right now,
[6494.64 → 6495.56] but yeah,
[6495.56 → 6496.16] here it is.
[6496.54 → 6497.02] Um,
[6497.08 → 6499.02] according to the
[6499.02 → 6500.10] uh,
[6500.10 → 6503.48] the minimum ceiling height for a badminton court at Olympic Games,
[6503.56 → 6504.52] youth Olympic Games,
[6504.60 → 6504.88] grade one,
[6504.94 → 6505.44] grade two,
[6505.44 → 6509.62] and badminton BWF level is 39 feet.
[6510.90 → 6512.04] Ours are,
[6512.36 → 6514.58] I want to say 32.
[6515.04 → 6515.48] Okay.
[6516.00 → 6516.18] Yeah.
[6516.18 → 6518.52] I think they're 32 or 34.
[6519.02 → 6520.46] I can't remember exactly,
[6520.68 → 6521.88] which is for,
[6521.88 → 6522.86] uh,
[6522.86 → 6526.28] even a high level recreational player more than fine,
[6526.28 → 6528.18] but those professional players,
[6528.28 → 6528.76] man,
[6528.80 → 6530.24] do they ever hit hard.
[6530.24 → 6533.02] And there are certain instances I actually saw,
[6533.30 → 6536.46] I saw so many people in the comments on that video who just,
[6536.64 → 6539.88] they don't know anything about badminton and I get it in North America.
[6539.88 → 6540.18] We,
[6540.94 → 6544.22] most people know absolutely nothing about the sport.
[6544.52 → 6544.82] I didn't.
[6544.96 → 6545.90] And one of the
[6545.98 → 6548.06] one of the big comments that I saw from people is,
[6548.12 → 6549.76] what do you need all that vertical height for,
[6549.82 → 6550.38] for badminton?
[6550.54 → 6550.72] Well,
[6550.80 → 6551.76] let me tell you,
[6551.76 → 6552.46] uh,
[6552.52 → 6553.40] high level players,
[6553.40 → 6557.48] if their opponent plays a really tight shot over the net where they're
[6557.48 → 6560.22] basically just coming in like this and just kind of popping it
[6560.22 → 6560.40] up.
[6560.48 → 6564.66] So the shuttle tumbles, and it is just barely like kind of rolls over the net.
[6565.08 → 6567.08] What they're going to do to,
[6567.22 → 6570.46] to counter that is they're going to come up, and they're going to hit it as
[6570.46 → 6572.24] high as humanly possible,
[6573.24 → 6573.80] way,
[6573.92 → 6575.42] way up and toward the back of the court.
[6575.70 → 6577.72] And the more ceiling height you have,
[6578.24 → 6582.60] the more travel they can get toward the back of the court.
[6582.66 → 6585.64] And that's really important because the closer it is to the front,
[6585.78 → 6589.52] the more likely it is that they are going to be eating that shuttle when
[6589.52 → 6591.38] their opponent smashes it down at them.
[6592.04 → 6592.24] Um,
[6592.24 → 6593.76] so having it really,
[6594.06 → 6597.42] really having the ceilings really high is actually incredibly important.
[6597.54 → 6602.28] So we're not going to be able to host like a BWF sanctioned tournament or
[6602.28 → 6602.92] anything like that.
[6602.98 → 6604.00] That's not in our future.
[6604.12 → 6604.36] There's,
[6604.44 → 6605.74] that's how high the ceiling is.
[6605.84 → 6607.84] There's absolutely nothing we can do to change that.
[6607.96 → 6609.24] It'll be a quality facility.
[6609.38 → 6611.34] It'll have some of the highest ceilings in the lower mainland,
[6611.34 → 6614.88] but no BWF tournaments for us.
[6615.84 → 6616.68] Hawkeye would be cool though.
[6617.10 → 6617.88] Hawkeye would be sick.
[6618.00 → 6619.88] Just for any tournament.
[6620.06 → 6620.90] Even if it was just a video.
[6621.38 → 6621.62] Yeah.
[6621.78 → 6622.14] Yeah.
[6622.14 → 6623.26] Even if we had to tear it out,
[6623.32 → 6623.50] that's,
[6623.58 → 6623.98] that's fine.
[6624.00 → 6624.42] I'd be down.
[6624.66 → 6624.86] Yep.
[6625.18 → 6625.40] Yep.
[6627.26 → 6627.58] Uh,
[6627.58 → 6628.18] you got one more.
[6628.44 → 6628.74] No,
[6628.92 → 6629.88] I'm just,
[6630.02 → 6630.48] it's sponsors.
[6630.64 → 6631.52] You have to do sponsors now.
[6631.60 → 6631.86] Oh yeah.
[6631.86 → 6632.74] We better do sponsors.
[6633.92 → 6634.40] Uh,
[6634.56 → 6634.66] but,
[6634.74 → 6635.02] but,
[6635.02 → 6635.32] but,
[6635.32 → 6635.42] but,
[6635.42 → 6635.74] but right.

[6668.40 → 6669.46] there might be a twist.

[6672.20 → 6672.84] a clue checklist,
[6673.06 → 6674.86] and a secret ending envelope.

[6816.96 → 6820.08] The folks that prepare the show topics must just be like,
[6820.14 → 6820.94] what even is this?
[6821.06 → 6822.16] Why do we even bother?
[6822.28 → 6823.44] They don't talk about them anyway.
[6823.44 → 6825.40] This is the worst it has ever been.
[6825.50 → 6826.16] I'd be upset.
[6826.46 → 6827.32] I wouldn't be.
[6827.42 → 6828.34] Let's do a few topics.
[6828.46 → 6829.16] Let's do some topics.
[6829.18 → 6829.44] Sure.
[6829.52 → 6829.72] Please.
[6830.52 → 6830.80] GM?
[6831.76 → 6832.20] Sure.
[6832.52 → 6833.36] Let's talk about GM.
[6834.00 → 6834.64] General Motors.
[6835.04 → 6835.24] Yeah.
[6835.46 → 6837.20] They were bound to do something right eventually.
[6837.20 → 6840.26] You know, broken clock is right at least twice a day.
[6840.38 → 6843.48] It's like they got 10% on a Scantron, but they figured it out at the end.
[6843.60 → 6848.10] General Motors has announced that they will be bringing back their line of plug-in hybrid EVs,
[6848.10 → 6850.22] which they retired back in 2019.
[6850.62 → 6854.18] At the worst possible time!
[6854.86 → 6856.56] With the end of the Chevy Volt.
[6856.56 → 6863.28] The company has been under significant pressure from dealerships who have been struggling both to meet consumer demand for hybrids
[6863.28 → 6868.54] and to sell battery-only EVs in the quantity that's required by their carbon reduction quotas.
[6869.46 → 6873.54] How many times have I said the Volt was an amazing car,
[6874.10 → 6876.50] it was just ahead of its time,
[6877.26 → 6880.90] and if their problem was the lack of demand,
[6880.90 → 6883.62] so their dealers have apparently figured it out.
[6883.92 → 6884.86] They could have sold...
[6884.86 → 6886.22] Man, they could have sold this thing.
[6887.10 → 6888.58] It's such a cool car.
[6888.82 → 6889.00] Yeah.
[6889.16 → 6891.42] You only have to burn gas if you're going...
[6891.42 → 6896.24] Plug-in hybrid just makes so much sense for most people.
[6896.24 → 6896.32] They're awesome.
[6897.08 → 6899.24] And they just couldn't figure out how to sell it.
[6899.60 → 6901.48] Like, man, I'd read...
[6901.48 → 6904.14] Anytime I want to just be angry,
[6904.14 → 6909.94] I'll go and read, like, Chevy Volt message board messages and stuff,
[6910.00 → 6910.54] and people will be like,
[6910.58 → 6912.04] yeah, I worked at a dealership.
[6912.10 → 6913.36] This guy brings his car in,
[6913.66 → 6915.86] and he brings it in for a trade-in,
[6915.92 → 6916.64] and I'm like, oh, yeah,
[6916.72 → 6918.96] the like, lifetime fuel economy is really high.
[6919.02 → 6920.94] He's like, yeah, I never plugged it in.
[6921.72 → 6922.50] Like, not once.
[6923.32 → 6925.06] The f*** are you doing?
[6925.52 → 6928.06] You could do your daily commute on battery,
[6928.26 → 6929.36] and anytime you need to go far,
[6929.40 → 6930.20] you just put gas in it.
[6930.22 → 6931.30] It's the best of both worlds.
[6931.30 → 6934.08] You don't have to strip mine the entire country
[6934.08 → 6934.94] to get all the lithium,
[6935.12 → 6936.88] because they just have small batteries,
[6936.88 → 6940.32] and you don't have to just, like, put gas in every week,
[6940.42 → 6943.24] because you just really like consuming gas.
[6943.28 → 6946.32] Because the vast majority of most people's driving
[6946.32 → 6948.64] is A, extremely predictable,
[6949.38 → 6951.58] and B, not super long range.
[6952.06 → 6955.48] But you want your car to be able to do that sometimes.
[6955.64 → 6956.54] So you don't have that anxiety.
[6956.56 → 6959.02] So the EV solution is enormous batteries.
[6959.02 → 6960.24] Yeah, and they're not so heavy,
[6960.24 → 6962.28] because they don't have gigantic batteries in them.
[6962.28 → 6964.02] So they actually end up being crazy fuel efficient?
[6964.14 → 6964.86] And I get it.
[6964.92 → 6966.80] They were pretty expensive to produce,
[6967.00 → 6969.14] but they managed to discontinue it
[6969.14 → 6972.32] right before car prices went like this,
[6972.64 → 6973.46] in general.
[6974.60 → 6977.18] Anywho, other manufacturers
[6977.18 → 6978.92] also seem to be jumping on the plug-in
[6978.92 → 6980.30] hybrid electric vehicle bandwagon.
[6980.42 → 6983.54] As of now, there are 33 different PHEV models
[6983.54 → 6984.38] available in the US.
[6984.82 → 6987.42] Six different automakers have three or more
[6987.42 → 6988.82] PHEV models available,
[6988.98 → 6991.68] and even Lamborghini launched a plug-in hybrid in 2023,
[6992.04 → 6995.66] though they don't plan to introduce an EV until 2028.
[6996.30 → 6997.84] Our discussion question here is,
[6997.96 → 7000.10] was EV adoption pushed too hard?
[7000.52 → 7002.82] And did Elon Musk bamboozle all of us
[7002.82 → 7004.62] when really we should have switched to hydrogen
[7004.62 → 7005.58] and called it a century?
[7006.24 → 7008.28] I mean, I'm not going to try to speak
[7008.28 → 7009.80] to the whole hydrogen fuel cell thing.
[7009.86 → 7010.96] I got to be honest with you guys.
[7010.96 → 7014.48] It's not a technology that I understand well enough
[7014.48 → 7017.22] to comment on all the infrastructure challenges
[7017.22 → 7018.84] that would have been involved in that.
[7019.32 → 7023.56] But what I will say is that for most people,
[7024.18 → 7026.18] at the time of the introduction of the Model S,
[7026.30 → 7028.88] when the Chevy Volt was still in its early days,
[7029.08 → 7030.78] like the first gen Chevy Volt kind of sucked.
[7031.38 → 7033.90] And that's the reason that I didn't buy a Prius Prime
[7033.90 → 7035.68] back when I bought my secondhand Chevy Volt
[7035.68 → 7037.22] was because the range wasn't good enough.
[7037.56 → 7039.76] It was like 30 miles or something like that.
[7039.76 → 7040.82] It's not enough.
[7041.26 → 7043.12] The second gen Volt though could do,
[7043.26 → 7044.96] I think something like 55.
[7045.46 → 7046.56] I only know it in kilometres.
[7046.76 → 7049.32] It'll go anywhere from 60, 70 to 100 kilometres
[7049.32 → 7050.14] depending on the weather.
[7052.28 → 7054.30] And once that thing launched,
[7055.24 → 7056.48] for most people,
[7056.66 → 7059.20] I think it made more sense than a full electric vehicle.
[7060.02 → 7063.00] Yeah, it was pretty expensive upfront.
[7063.16 → 7064.66] And I could see a lot of people looking at it going,
[7064.66 → 7066.42] oh, well, I might as well just go full EV.
[7067.02 → 7068.06] But that's the thing.
[7068.14 → 7069.40] Depending on your usage,
[7069.76 → 7071.94] you could basically go full EV.
[7072.40 → 7077.30] I did well over 80% of my driving in that car on battery.
[7080.64 → 7082.80] And then anytime I needed to go really far,
[7083.10 → 7083.66] I could.
[7084.12 → 7084.36] Yeah.
[7085.38 → 7086.76] I know the sex appeal.
[7088.12 → 7089.00] Not much.
[7089.40 → 7090.30] I get it.
[7090.42 → 7092.38] But you can make plug-in hybrid cars
[7092.38 → 7093.50] that have a lot.
[7094.00 → 7094.62] You could.
[7094.82 → 7095.78] They just didn't.
[7095.78 → 7096.14] Yeah.
[7096.48 → 7098.54] Actually, I think the Volt was an okay looking car.
[7098.68 → 7099.32] I think it was fine.
[7099.38 → 7100.24] I think it could have been,
[7100.36 → 7101.96] I think there could have been things about it.
[7102.10 → 7104.60] It had notable family car energy.
[7104.74 → 7105.00] Oh, yeah.
[7105.78 → 7107.84] But I don't think it was bad at all.
[7107.94 → 7108.76] Definite dad energy.
[7108.86 → 7110.06] Yeah, the 2024 Prius.
[7110.06 → 7112.86] People have been drooling over this thing.
[7112.90 → 7114.48] And it finally has decent range.
[7116.46 → 7117.06] And it's just,
[7117.72 → 7120.36] Chevy is not there to participate
[7120.36 → 7123.46] in a market that they practically invented.
[7124.32 → 7125.06] It's just,
[7125.54 → 7125.80] sorry,
[7125.92 → 7126.28] GM.
[7126.28 → 7126.90] So Chevy,
[7127.02 → 7127.88] the sub-brand of GM,
[7127.98 → 7128.38] Chevy Volt,
[7128.56 → 7129.20] General Motors.
[7129.54 → 7131.44] It's just mind-blowing to me
[7131.44 → 7134.16] how at every possible turn,
[7134.90 → 7137.28] GM can get electrification
[7137.28 → 7140.78] just 180 degrees from correct.
[7143.78 → 7144.34] Yeah.
[7146.44 → 7147.60] It's kind of frustrating.
[7148.58 → 7148.72] Yeah.
[7148.84 → 7150.28] Cough EV1 says,
[7150.34 → 7152.82] Stimulus in float plane chat.
[7152.96 → 7153.84] A hundred percent.
[7154.60 → 7154.74] Yeah.
[7154.74 → 7156.32] New Prius Prime looks pretty nice, actually.
[7158.62 → 7159.30] What's the
[7159.36 → 7160.88] what's the range on this thing though?
[7161.70 → 7163.50] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7163.64 → 7164.22] And that's the
[7164.28 → 7164.58] oh man,
[7164.62 → 7165.48] see this is the other thing
[7165.48 → 7166.42] that people don't realize
[7166.42 → 7167.46] about these plug-in hybrids
[7167.46 → 7170.16] is that not only do you drive on pure electric
[7170.16 → 7171.54] a lot of the time,
[7171.54 → 7173.14] but when you are burning gas,
[7173.22 → 7176.62] they are just wildly efficient.
[7177.00 → 7177.08] Yeah.
[7177.54 → 7179.72] 4.4, 4.6 city highway.
[7181.54 → 7182.36] Like what?
[7182.64 → 7183.22] Yeah, that's wild.
[7183.34 → 7184.06] That's awesome.
[7185.64 → 7186.08] Specifications.
[7186.20 → 7186.58] Here we go.
[7187.06 → 7187.22] Okay.
[7187.26 → 7187.86] Show me my,
[7187.94 → 7189.36] show me my all battery range though.
[7189.46 → 7189.60] Where,
[7189.66 → 7190.36] where are we at here?
[7191.28 → 7192.00] Blah, blah, blah.
[7193.18 → 7193.60] Horsepower?
[7194.30 → 7194.66] Kilowatts?
[7194.74 → 7194.98] Okay.
[7195.34 → 7196.66] What is this measure?
[7198.54 → 7200.14] Is horsepower a metric?
[7200.94 → 7201.30] Sorry.
[7201.44 → 7201.70] Anyway,
[7201.82 → 7202.56] hold on one sec.
[7202.76 → 7203.18] Like what,
[7203.26 → 7203.54] what are you,
[7203.58 → 7204.48] what are you even talking about?
[7204.56 → 7205.22] Okay.
[7205.42 → 7205.74] Hold on.
[7205.88 → 7206.24] Wait,
[7206.32 → 7207.32] why is these dimensions?
[7207.70 → 7209.40] Why is horsepower a dimension?
[7209.40 → 7213.46] That's actually really weird.
[7214.08 → 7214.52] Um,
[7214.80 → 7216.62] I don't know,
[7216.70 → 7216.86] man.
[7216.90 → 7217.26] I just,
[7217.76 → 7220.18] wow,
[7220.22 → 7220.76] that's odd.
[7221.52 → 7222.36] Stuff happens.
[7222.50 → 7222.78] You know,
[7222.78 → 7223.90] I just,
[7223.98 → 7225.46] I've decided to be less judgy.
[7226.90 → 7227.30] Okay.
[7227.34 → 7227.76] I don't know.
[7227.90 → 7228.64] Maybe someone knows.
[7231.64 → 7232.08] Uh,
[7232.08 → 7233.86] that 4.4 is litres per hundred kilometres.
[7233.98 → 7234.82] Just want to clarify that.
[7234.88 → 7235.88] I'm on the Canadian site.
[7235.88 → 7239.16] Kilowatts are metrics and engine power.
[7239.28 → 7239.42] You know,
[7239.48 → 7239.82] I know,
[7239.92 → 7242.68] but how are horsepower and kilowatts the same?
[7242.80 → 7243.24] Are they?
[7244.56 → 7245.56] Are they though?
[7250.14 → 7252.16] Kilowatts versus horsepower.
[7252.50 → 7256.10] There's no way that a horsepower is exactly a thousand watts.
[7256.18 → 7257.00] I don't believe that.
[7257.00 → 7265.12] A power level of one horsepower is approximately equivalent to 746 watts or 0.746 kilowatts.
[7265.20 → 7265.44] Okay.
[7265.44 → 7267.70] And there's the mechanical and hydraulic horsepower.
[7267.86 → 7268.74] I don't even care anymore.
[7268.88 → 7270.58] To convert from horsepower to watts,
[7270.68 → 7272.92] simply multiply by 746.
[7273.20 → 7273.36] Nope.
[7273.40 → 7273.94] I'm over it.
[7274.32 → 7275.54] To convert from watts to horsepower,
[7275.54 → 7276.06] I'm over it.
[7276.08 → 7276.72] Modify by,
[7276.94 → 7277.32] uh,
[7277.32 → 7277.70] multiply,
[7277.86 → 7278.02] sorry,
[7278.12 → 7279.66] by 0.00134.
[7280.44 → 7280.66] Yeah.
[7280.76 → 7281.46] So anyway,
[7281.70 → 7282.16] um,
[7282.62 → 7283.06] good job,
[7283.12 → 7283.38] Toyota.
[7284.30 → 7284.56] Yeah.
[7285.70 → 7289.90] Missing an absolutely critical spec from the page altogether,
[7289.90 → 7291.48] how far it can go on battery.
[7291.48 → 7292.44] And then also,
[7292.88 → 7293.38] um,
[7293.44 → 7294.68] horsepower is a dimension.
[7294.68 → 7295.44] Yeah,
[7295.52 → 7295.84] sure.
[7297.30 → 7297.70] Yeah.
[7298.36 → 7298.68] Uh,
[7298.68 → 7301.10] what else are we talking about today?
[7302.94 → 7303.30] Oh,
[7303.30 → 7305.22] Oh,
[7305.68 → 7307.34] is it time?
[7307.60 → 7307.74] Yeah,
[7307.76 → 7308.14] let's do it.
[7308.44 → 7308.86] All right.
[7309.24 → 7309.70] Um,
[7309.70 → 7309.98] I,
[7309.98 → 7310.00] I,
[7310.00 → 7310.14] I,
[7310.14 → 7310.20] I,
[7310.20 → 7312.72] I've just been hearing you talk about this forever.
[7312.92 → 7313.08] So,
[7313.32 → 7313.48] no,
[7313.64 → 7314.66] apparently turned off.
[7314.74 → 7314.82] Well,
[7314.88 → 7315.62] Dan's supposed to do it,
[7315.62 → 7315.76] right?
[7315.92 → 7316.04] No,
[7316.08 → 7316.16] no,
[7316.22 → 7316.30] I,
[7316.38 → 7316.48] no,
[7316.54 → 7316.60] no,
[7316.60 → 7316.62] no,
[7316.62 → 7317.14] I got this.
[7317.24 → 7317.56] I just,
[7317.64 → 7318.18] I think I just need,
[7318.28 → 7319.36] I probably went to sleep.
[7320.00 → 7321.88] It's a sleeping Kitty bitty Apple.
[7321.88 → 7321.96] Cool.
[7322.24 → 7322.52] Okay.
[7322.84 → 7325.10] So one thing I'm not going to be able to show you guys,
[7325.16 → 7325.92] or rather I could,
[7326.00 → 7329.40] but I don't feel like going through the entire initialization process for this thing,
[7329.62 → 7334.26] but it is shockingly difficult to sign up for Apple Arcade without an iPhone.
[7334.42 → 7336.00] Make sure you don't blast your credit card,
[7336.08 → 7336.34] by the way.
[7336.34 → 7336.74] Uh,
[7336.78 → 7336.94] yeah,
[7336.98 → 7337.12] yeah,
[7337.18 → 7338.12] that should be fine.
[7338.42 → 7338.70] Okay.
[7338.74 → 7339.30] What just happened?
[7339.58 → 7339.90] Okay,
[7339.96 → 7340.26] sure.
[7340.36 → 7341.12] That makes sense.
[7341.62 → 7342.02] Um,
[7342.08 → 7343.22] so I have already,
[7343.38 → 7343.52] the
[7343.58 → 7350.44] the issue is that getting your Apple ID signed in on this thing pretty much requires an iPhone.
[7350.72 → 7351.08] Uh,
[7351.08 → 7351.28] it was,
[7351.34 → 7351.58] it was,
[7351.66 → 7352.54] it was a real pain in the butt.
[7352.58 → 7352.68] Oh,
[7352.70 → 7354.00] I hate this touch sensitive remote.
[7354.38 → 7356.08] I always accidentally click it.
[7356.14 → 7359.34] I feel like watching my grandparents operate anything technological.
[7359.34 → 7359.64] Okay.
[7359.64 → 7359.94] So,
[7360.28 → 7360.46] Oh,
[7360.56 → 7360.78] Oh,
[7360.78 → 7361.02] Oh,
[7361.02 → 7361.22] Oh,
[7361.22 → 7362.50] Handyman's bringing a good point.
[7362.58 → 7363.52] Make sure it's updated.
[7364.74 → 7366.30] Are there any updates that this,
[7366.34 → 7366.78] device?
[7367.12 → 7367.46] I don't know,
[7367.46 → 7370.30] but it looks like it says I can cancel anytime.
[7370.46 → 7373.42] So it looks like they've either changed it.
[7373.96 → 7374.44] Um,
[7374.44 → 7376.96] so it should be under subscriptions,
[7376.96 → 7377.48] I guess.
[7378.86 → 7379.42] Um,
[7380.34 → 7380.86] no,
[7380.98 → 7381.08] I,
[7381.16 → 7381.62] I forget,
[7381.70 → 7383.22] I forget where it's supposed to be.
[7383.32 → 7384.26] You leaked your name.
[7384.40 → 7384.66] Yeah,
[7384.68 → 7385.16] that's fine.
[7386.44 → 7386.92] Uh,
[7387.28 → 7387.50] blah,
[7387.54 → 7387.68] blah,
[7387.76 → 7388.08] blah,
[7388.26 → 7388.44] blah,
[7388.44 → 7388.68] blah,
[7388.74 → 7389.12] blah.
[7391.12 → 7391.64] Mm.
[7393.64 → 7394.04] Uh,
[7394.30 → 7395.02] apps maybe.
[7395.82 → 7396.32] Can't remember.
[7396.34 → 7396.96] There's definitely,
[7396.96 → 7398.92] there's definitely somewhere it's supposed to be.
[7400.06 → 7400.50] Uh,
[7400.62 → 7400.94] yeah,
[7401.00 → 7402.26] that's a game that I've played.
[7403.04 → 7403.48] Uh,
[7404.58 → 7405.06] system.
[7406.52 → 7406.96] Okay.
[7407.04 → 7407.28] Well,
[7407.28 → 7408.96] it was not easy to find.
[7410.18 → 7410.60] No,
[7410.64 → 7411.14] seriously though.
[7411.14 → 7412.08] Where is it supposed to be?
[7412.12 → 7412.22] No,
[7412.24 → 7412.42] maybe,
[7412.42 → 7412.72] maybe,
[7412.86 → 7413.78] maybe it is still hiding.
[7414.88 → 7415.32] Uh,
[7415.52 → 7416.00] okay.
[7416.00 → 7416.24] Well,
[7416.30 → 7419.22] going into the Apple Arcade app is not the solution.
[7420.00 → 7420.70] There's no,
[7420.84 → 7421.22] you just,
[7421.32 → 7421.96] you just scroll.
[7422.32 → 7422.60] Um,
[7422.60 → 7425.94] there's no unsubscribe in here.
[7426.08 → 7426.48] Uh,
[7426.48 → 7426.66] Dan,
[7426.70 → 7427.62] do you mind moving the
[7427.62 → 7427.90] uh,
[7427.90 → 7429.22] topics piece of paper?
[7430.94 → 7431.40] Oh yeah.
[7431.40 → 7432.06] Let's go to account.
[7432.92 → 7433.68] Let's go to account.
[7433.76 → 7433.88] Yeah.
[7434.02 → 7435.08] General account.
[7435.08 → 7435.56] I think,
[7435.68 → 7435.94] uh,
[7435.94 → 7437.46] or you're supposed to click your new username.
[7437.58 → 7438.14] Some people in flip.
[7438.20 → 7438.44] Yeah.
[7438.44 → 7438.80] Yeah.
[7438.80 → 7438.96] Yeah.
[7438.96 → 7439.10] Yeah.
[7439.28 → 7439.44] Yeah.
[7439.44 → 7439.80] I know.
[7439.80 → 7440.24] I know it's,
[7440.30 → 7444.66] it's supposed to be in here somewhere because I Googled it and I did manage to find it at
[7444.66 → 7445.24] some point.
[7446.16 → 7446.56] Um,
[7447.64 → 7449.14] like find where it was supposed to be.
[7449.22 → 7449.56] Here we go.
[7449.62 → 7449.94] Here we go.
[7450.00 → 7450.44] Subscriptions.
[7450.92 → 7451.12] Yeah.
[7451.34 → 7451.96] That's what I would do.
[7452.84 → 7453.28] Okay.
[7454.80 → 7456.84] What the actual f**k?
[7457.24 → 7458.36] Can you just sign in manually?
[7458.92 → 7462.28] I have already signed in on this device.
[7462.96 → 7464.34] To change the settings.
[7464.66 → 7464.88] Sign in.
[7465.64 → 7465.82] Yeah.
[7465.84 → 7467.66] That sounds like a very normal Apple thing though.
[7468.40 → 7468.84] Um,
[7468.84 → 7472.88] because they always make you re-sign in or re-pin into like everything when you have an iPhone.
[7472.88 → 7476.70] So unsubscribing from something when I am signed in should be one click.
[7477.96 → 7479.50] Exactly one click.
[7479.80 → 7480.14] Now,
[7480.18 → 7480.50] hold on.
[7480.60 → 7483.30] I don't think that's true for like anywhere because they ask you to confirm.
[7483.44 → 7483.68] Okay.
[7483.86 → 7484.72] Oh my God.
[7485.82 → 7486.22] Uh,
[7486.22 → 7487.80] let me see if I can find this.
[7490.14 → 7490.64] I don't,
[7490.70 → 7492.54] I actually don't know my iTunes password right now.
[7492.56 → 7495.54] And I think the only way for me to see the screen is for me to share it with you.
[7495.82 → 7498.58] So it's possible that this has been fixed now,
[7498.64 → 7499.66] but I can,
[7499.78 → 7501.10] I can actually do a thing.
[7501.26 → 7501.94] I found,
[7502.10 → 7502.28] no,
[7502.30 → 7502.38] no,
[7502.38 → 7502.72] it's fine.
[7502.88 → 7504.32] I found this before the show.
[7504.68 → 7506.86] So back when I tried to do it,
[7507.44 → 7511.26] I came across this discussion thread on apple.com,
[7511.64 → 7518.42] which showed that someone else ran into the issue where there was no cancellation button for Apple Arcade.
[7518.60 → 7521.56] The button to cancel was physically not there.
[7521.64 → 7522.34] This is from February,
[7522.46 → 7522.90] 2022.
[7523.82 → 7527.92] And I came across this post of someone that had the same issue because for me,
[7527.94 → 7528.68] it wasn't there.
[7528.68 → 7529.68] I clicked on this.
[7529.68 → 7531.56] I clicked on this.
[7531.56 → 7531.58] I clicked on this.
[7532.58 → 7540.80] And this still has no reference whatsoever for how to cancel a subscription from the Apple TV.
[7540.80 → 7549.78] So this is how I ended up being forced to install iTunes in order to install iTunes in order to get rid of the subscription.
[7549.78 → 7555.28] There is absolutely no way from within a browser to cancel a subscription,
[7555.28 → 7558.86] which is absolutely wild to me.
[7558.94 → 7559.66] Within a browser.
[7559.66 → 7560.66] I couldn't believe it.
[7560.66 → 7561.16] I couldn't believe it.
[7561.16 → 7562.24] Here.
[7563.50 → 7564.78] Let me sign in.
[7565.42 → 7565.58] Let me,
[7565.76 → 7566.24] oh man,
[7566.34 → 7566.54] oh,
[7566.64 → 7567.84] this is not going to be,
[7567.98 → 7569.42] this is not going to be easy.
[7569.82 → 7570.72] I'm going to need a new,
[7570.96 → 7571.22] okay,
[7571.32 → 7572.78] maybe I'm not as prepped for this as I,
[7572.82 → 7573.88] as I should be.
[7574.10 → 7575.16] Should I do another topic?
[7575.16 → 7575.44] Yeah,
[7575.44 → 7575.60] sure.
[7575.64 → 7576.68] Why don't you do a topic while I,
[7576.74 → 7577.46] while I get this going?
[7577.84 → 7578.16] Sure.
[7578.30 → 7580.72] I'll do the one that we kind of leaked earlier.
[7580.72 → 7581.12] Uh,
[7581.12 → 7584.74] Japanese government finally weans itself off of floppy disks.
[7584.92 → 7585.92] Since 2022,
[7586.34 → 7587.62] Japan's ministry of economy,
[7587.78 → 7588.08] trade,
[7588.14 → 7595.14] and industry has been pushing for the modernization of over 1900 submission protocols throughout the Japanese government,
[7595.26 → 7597.18] which still required companies to,
[7597.46 → 7597.76] oh,
[7598.10 → 7598.56] whoa.
[7599.56 → 7603.04] So it wasn't that companies were necessarily just happened to be submitting this way.
[7603.16 → 7609.08] It required companies to submit official documents in outdated and defunct media formats like mini disks,
[7609.56 → 7610.28] floppy disks,
[7610.70 → 7611.56] and CD-ROMs.
[7612.38 → 7613.20] This year,
[7613.32 → 7613.56] many,
[7613.68 → 7615.90] but not all of those requirements will be sunset,
[7616.14 → 7620.36] finally allowing companies to move beyond 1.4 megabyte floppy disks,
[7620.64 → 7623.34] which stopped being sold by their last major manufacturer,
[7623.52 → 7623.76] Sony,
[7624.14 → 7625.14] in 2011.
[7626.10 → 7626.62] Globally,
[7626.76 → 7628.54] many industries still use floppy disks,
[7628.56 → 7629.46] for legacy hardware,
[7629.62 → 7629.84] like,
[7629.92 → 7630.22] uh,
[7630.22 → 7632.74] medical equipment and older planes.
[7633.04 → 7633.40] Notably,
[7633.50 → 7640.12] the U.S. government only modernized its nuclear launch coordination system to stop using floppy disks in 2019.
[7641.32 → 7641.72] Um,
[7641.78 → 7642.52] discussion question is,
[7642.58 → 7644.36] why do institutions hold on to legacy media?
[7644.58 → 7646.40] Why is it so hard to modernize?
[7646.54 → 7647.90] I think a lot of it is,
[7647.98 → 7648.68] if it works,
[7648.90 → 7650.64] don't fix it kind of mentality,
[7650.64 → 7654.62] which is honestly often not the wrong kind of mentality.
[7654.62 → 7655.40] Um,
[7655.90 → 7659.22] especially for things that were fine.
[7659.78 → 7660.18] Um,
[7660.84 → 7662.88] I don't know.
[7663.88 → 7664.32] Yeah.
[7664.44 → 7664.68] Like,
[7664.72 → 7666.62] if all you need to submit is a document,
[7666.62 → 7667.82] um,
[7668.58 → 7669.70] and their system works that way,
[7669.72 → 7670.62] it's probably okay.
[7670.62 → 7672.02] I know there's like,
[7672.10 → 7673.70] there are issues at scale,
[7673.70 → 7675.50] at like government scale as well.
[7675.50 → 7677.08] And you only have a certain amount of budget.
[7677.08 → 7680.42] Like if your IT team only has a certain amount of budget,
[7680.42 → 7681.16] uh,
[7681.16 → 7683.08] they're going to have to cut things,
[7683.62 → 7684.10] um,
[7684.52 → 7685.94] to be able to do other things.
[7685.94 → 7686.30] Right.
[7686.82 → 7687.22] Um,
[7687.22 → 7687.72] and if I'm,
[7687.78 → 7690.16] if I'm assuming that they're not misusing this budget,
[7690.16 → 7691.26] which is highly questionable,
[7691.26 → 7693.70] but if I am assuming that they're not misusing this budget,
[7693.70 → 7696.30] they're going to put it towards other things that might need it more,
[7696.30 → 7697.22] um,
[7697.48 → 7698.82] than something like that.
[7699.14 → 7699.66] I don't know.
[7699.86 → 7700.22] Also,
[7700.22 → 7700.66] there's,
[7700.74 → 7701.96] there's someone who brought up,
[7702.02 → 7704.58] isn't it really hard to hack into ancient tech?
[7704.68 → 7706.06] It's not necessarily true,
[7706.06 → 7706.64] uh,
[7706.64 → 7708.16] but it might not be as much of a target,
[7708.16 → 7708.94] um,
[7708.96 → 7709.40] or,
[7709.40 → 7710.72] or people might not know,
[7710.72 → 7711.96] um,
[7712.36 → 7713.20] how to do it,
[7713.20 → 7716.34] but I wouldn't say it's necessarily harder.
[7716.62 → 7717.02] Okay.
[7717.24 → 7719.28] I've got one little update for you guys.
[7720.28 → 7722.16] So if you go to the Apple support site,
[7722.20 → 7727.92] which is where I ended up, and I clicked on TV and I clicked on billing and
[7727.92 → 7728.32] subscriptions,
[7728.32 → 7730.48] this all seems pretty good,
[7730.58 → 7730.86] right?
[7730.96 → 7731.92] Start your cancellation.
[7733.08 → 7734.32] This is what greets you.
[7739.28 → 7740.70] What is the fine text there?
[7740.72 → 7743.02] If you don't have iTunes,
[7743.16 → 7743.90] download it for free.
[7744.04 → 7747.96] Why the fuck do I need iTunes to cancel a subscription?
[7749.96 → 7750.80] That is a little weird.
[7752.74 → 7753.82] So download it.
[7754.36 → 7754.72] Why?
[7756.88 → 7757.28] Why?
[7760.10 → 7760.46] No,
[7760.52 → 7760.98] really though,
[7761.04 → 7763.90] I would actually like to know what the justification is for that.
[7764.90 → 7765.60] I don't know.
[7765.66 → 7766.24] I can't tell you.
[7766.24 → 7769.28] I can't think of any reason why I should have to do that.
[7771.28 → 7772.42] Isn't iTunes dead?
[7772.76 → 7772.96] Well,
[7773.18 → 7773.60] clearly not.
[7773.70 → 7773.84] Okay.
[7773.86 → 7775.68] So people want me to go to my iCloud account.
[7775.78 → 7775.92] Okay.
[7775.92 → 7776.36] So hold on.
[7776.44 → 7776.84] iCloud.
[7777.22 → 7777.56] Let's,
[7777.68 → 7778.74] let's sign in to iCloud.
[7779.12 → 7779.42] Okay.
[7779.42 → 7779.84] Here we go.
[7780.60 → 7781.24] Let's do it.
[7781.24 → 7781.50] Let's,
[7781.58 → 7781.94] let's,
[7781.94 → 7781.98] let's,
[7781.98 → 7782.28] let's,
[7782.34 → 7782.74] let's,
[7782.74 → 7783.44] let's play.
[7783.62 → 7783.86] Let's,
[7783.96 → 7785.04] let's have the experience.
[7787.76 → 7792.72] It is entirely possible that at some point I missed something.
[7794.42 → 7795.28] Oh my God.
[7795.28 → 7798.40] People are also pointing out a bunch of different things.
[7798.50 → 7798.60] Yeah.
[7798.70 → 7802.52] Purchasing things as a government entity is often very interesting.
[7802.90 → 7803.26] Uh,
[7803.26 → 7805.52] because you can't just like to go out and buy the cheapest one.
[7805.60 → 7809.96] You have to go through like all these processes and Ada,
[7810.02 → 7813.02] Ada can end up costing a lot more than you would expect.
[7813.38 → 7813.70] Um,
[7813.88 → 7815.66] I don't have my iPhone on me,
[7815.66 → 7817.76] so I guess I need to get a phone call now.
[7823.34 → 7823.70] Yeah.
[7823.84 → 7824.48] Pretty fantastic.
[7825.28 → 7828.72] Why does it have a British accent?
[7829.50 → 7830.46] At that scale,
[7830.54 → 7832.76] wouldn't time saved outweigh that it works mentality?
[7833.00 → 7834.02] Clearly it just did.
[7836.46 → 7838.52] Or more probably in my opinion,
[7838.52 → 7840.42] it was enough companies complaining about it.
[7842.34 → 7842.94] All right,
[7842.94 → 7843.40] here we go.
[7846.32 → 7847.36] What's new on iCloud?
[7847.50 → 7848.08] Don't care.
[7848.86 → 7849.30] Okay.
[7849.46 → 7851.46] I did not think to sign in to iCloud.
[7851.64 → 7853.52] I somehow got signed in to,
[7853.52 → 7854.34] um,
[7854.34 → 7856.62] like the Apple support site before.
[7856.74 → 7858.08] I couldn't even find a sign in today,
[7858.08 → 7860.24] but I did manage to find it at some point.
[7860.32 → 7863.40] You should continue to be careful as document names and things are being shown.
[7863.78 → 7863.92] Oh,
[7864.02 → 7866.68] this is all complete garbage.
[7866.94 → 7867.54] Look at this.
[7867.60 → 7869.20] This is from 2020 or something.
[7869.72 → 7870.12] Yeah.
[7870.12 → 7870.92] Don't worry about it.
[7870.92 → 7871.92] Uh,
[7871.92 → 7873.06] okay.
[7873.76 → 7875.24] Your iCloud plan.
[7876.78 → 7878.80] We're getting into dangerous settings,
[7878.96 → 7879.08] sir.
[7879.12 → 7880.24] I think you should off.
[7880.46 → 7880.86] I'll be fine.
[7880.90 → 7881.84] There's nothing on here,
[7881.90 → 7882.04] Luke.
[7882.08 → 7882.76] I promise you.
[7883.74 → 7884.26] Settings.
[7885.26 → 7886.04] I know.
[7887.18 → 7888.46] Apple ID settings.
[7888.46 → 7890.10] Sure.
[7890.20 → 7891.60] Let's try Apple ID settings.
[7891.98 → 7892.84] What are people saying?
[7895.68 → 7896.20] Uh,
[7896.54 → 7896.92] okay.
[7897.18 → 7897.70] Yeah.
[7897.82 → 7898.02] Okay.
[7898.02 → 7899.06] Family sharing.
[7900.10 → 7900.78] Uh,
[7901.58 → 7902.66] yeah.
[7902.66 → 7905.84] The really bizarre one was that it wouldn't let me remove the credit card.
[7905.84 → 7911.50] So I eventually did install iTunes, and it wouldn't let me remove my credit card because I was the
[7911.50 → 7911.76] uh,
[7911.76 → 7912.90] the family owner.
[7913.92 → 7914.40] Um,
[7914.48 → 7919.48] it looks like I can change that in iCloud.
[7919.58 → 7921.04] It didn't tell me where to change that.
[7921.08 → 7922.28] It just said you can't.
[7922.28 → 7923.84] So I didn't know that.
[7926.32 → 7926.88] Uh,
[7927.00 → 7928.02] role organizer,
[7928.64 → 7930.94] how to change your family settings.
[7931.44 → 7933.88] This is fricking hilarious.
[7933.88 → 7936.04] Check this out.
[7936.60 → 7937.00] Okay.
[7937.00 → 7938.62] So I clicked on my role organizer.
[7938.78 → 7940.14] You have access to these subscriptions,
[7940.92 → 7941.80] shared features,
[7942.14 → 7944.20] how to change it on an iPhone,
[7944.40 → 7945.62] iPad or iPod touch.
[7945.94 → 7948.18] Go here on a Mac.
[7948.38 → 7949.24] Go here.
[7949.68 → 7951.26] Don't have enough of our products.
[7951.26 → 7952.26] Go yourself.
[7958.26 → 7958.86] Seriously.
[7959.44 → 7960.46] Where is my,
[7960.64 → 7962.54] where is my unsubscribe button here?
[7963.88 → 7965.40] And look guys,
[7965.96 → 7973.90] my point wasn't necessarily that exactly the exact steps that I went through or didn't go through.
[7973.98 → 7975.12] My point was,
[7975.22 → 7982.90] this is a prime example of some of the most ludicrous dark patterns that I have personally encountered.
[7982.90 → 7986.44] It was far more difficult than it should be.
[7990.58 → 7991.02] Okay.
[7991.08 → 7991.88] So hold on a second.
[7991.98 → 7992.30] Let's,
[7992.38 → 7992.74] uh,
[7993.56 → 7993.90] is,
[7994.00 → 7994.96] can anyone else,
[7995.08 → 7995.86] I'm,
[7995.86 → 7997.32] I'm open to suggestions here.
[7997.40 → 8003.24] Can anyone else figure out where in my iCloud account I should go to remove?
[8003.24 → 8004.68] There's some people that are really mad.
[8004.76 → 8007.42] I'm trying to get the steps that they want you to do from them.
[8007.64 → 8008.02] Sure.
[8008.16 → 8008.34] No,
[8008.36 → 8008.46] no,
[8008.46 → 8009.42] I know how to do it.
[8009.42 → 8010.88] I did cancel my subscription guys.
[8010.92 → 8012.04] I did figure it out,
[8012.04 → 8014.58] but it's not that easy.
[8017.16 → 8017.48] Oh,
[8017.54 → 8017.86] but they,
[8017.94 → 8018.06] but,
[8018.14 → 8019.46] but it's right there on the Apple TV.
[8019.56 → 8019.72] Yes,
[8019.74 → 8019.88] yes,
[8019.88 → 8020.04] yes.
[8020.04 → 8020.20] Okay.
[8020.20 → 8021.52] We'll go back to the Apple TV now.
[8021.62 → 8021.78] Oh,
[8021.86 → 8022.44] Lord.
[8022.92 → 8023.12] Okay.
[8023.12 → 8023.58] Here we go.
[8024.44 → 8025.32] What's going on with that?
[8025.84 → 8026.16] Okay.
[8026.32 → 8026.64] Uh,
[8026.64 → 8026.80] Oh,
[8026.82 → 8027.10] hold on.
[8027.10 → 8027.72] I have to do this.
[8027.72 → 8027.98] Dan,
[8028.04 → 8028.78] am I able to see it,
[8028.84 → 8029.26] but not them?
[8029.72 → 8029.90] Yeah.
[8029.98 → 8030.86] Give me one sec there.
[8031.02 → 8031.28] Okay.
[8031.28 → 8031.86] I love the
[8032.38 → 8033.94] I love the floating merch message.
[8033.94 → 8037.24] Yeah.
[8037.72 → 8038.20] All right.
[8039.90 → 8040.78] I can see it.
[8041.02 → 8042.36] Luke's going to do another quick topic,
[8042.44 → 8042.58] right?
[8042.74 → 8043.14] Sure.
[8043.34 → 8043.60] Yeah.
[8043.80 → 8050.44] Apple launches the vision pro the vision pro released today after reportedly taking just over 200,000 pre-orders.
[8050.64 → 8053.30] First impressions from customers have been broadly positive.
[8053.66 → 8055.36] Some of the ones that I've talked to personally,
[8055.46 → 8057.54] this is not in the notes have been very positive.
[8058.00 → 8058.28] Uh,
[8058.28 → 8061.24] though the handful of reviews that went up on Wednesday were a bit more mixed.
[8061.32 → 8062.34] That is very true.
[8062.34 → 8065.22] The vision pro was praised for its crisp displays,
[8065.34 → 8067.04] minimal latency pass through mode.
[8067.14 → 8067.86] Very impressive.
[8068.32 → 8068.56] Um,
[8068.56 → 8070.42] and hand eye control interface.
[8070.56 → 8074.64] We already knew that the vision pro was going to be on the heavier end of headsets.
[8074.64 → 8076.88] Although I'm going to add a note here,
[8076.94 → 8077.54] uh,
[8077.54 → 8079.42] still lighter than a number of other ones.
[8079.80 → 8080.16] Um,
[8080.86 → 8082.96] but most reviewers noted that they really,
[8083.20 → 8084.04] uh,
[8084.06 → 8085.36] that they really noticed the weight,
[8085.50 → 8086.86] especially after a few hours,
[8086.86 → 8087.76] um,
[8088.12 → 8089.40] due to how front heavy it is.
[8089.46 → 8089.60] Yeah.
[8089.64 → 8091.18] The back is just the strap.
[8091.42 → 8091.94] Um,
[8091.94 → 8096.04] a lot of other ones have either a more substantial strap or something weighing off the back.
[8096.04 → 8097.70] So it helps counterbalance.
[8097.82 → 8100.50] This one's weight is basically all at the front of your face.
[8100.94 → 8101.20] Uh,
[8101.24 → 8106.08] impressions of the floating intangible keyboard range from clunky to usable.
[8106.56 → 8107.00] Eyesight,
[8107.10 → 8107.50] the vision,
[8107.50 → 8108.22] uh,
[8108.22 → 8108.52] pros,
[8108.64 → 8114.74] digital representation of the user's eyes on the external display is also apparently very uncanny looking in real life.
[8114.74 → 8115.06] Yeah,
[8115.06 → 8116.20] it looks very different.
[8116.20 → 8118.74] I think Marques made a big note of this.
[8118.80 → 8119.46] It looks very,
[8119.58 → 8120.86] very different from,
[8120.92 → 8121.26] um,
[8121.64 → 8122.04] the
[8122.04 → 8124.14] the examples in the
[8124.22 → 8124.76] like the
[8124.76 → 8125.68] I don't know what you'd call it.
[8125.68 → 8126.28] Product announcement,
[8126.44 → 8127.10] trailer videos,
[8127.18 → 8127.40] whatever.
[8127.40 → 8128.12] Uh,
[8128.20 → 8129.54] meta likewise announced today,
[8129.54 → 8130.70] a new update,
[8130.80 → 8134.66] adding playback support for Apple's stereoscopic spatial video,
[8134.66 → 8139.62] which can be recorded on iPhone 15 pro and pro max to their own quest headsets,
[8139.62 → 8142.68] as well as support for using game pads with the quest browser.
[8143.22 → 8143.70] Um,
[8143.70 → 8144.96] I don't know who wrote this,
[8145.02 → 8148.00] but it says I Googled and while vision pro supports game pads,
[8148.04 → 8150.30] it doesn't look like it supports the browser thing,
[8150.30 → 8150.86] but anyway,
[8151.44 → 8151.74] okay,
[8151.94 → 8152.20] cool.
[8152.74 → 8153.20] Um,
[8153.62 → 8154.28] discussion question.
[8154.34 → 8157.50] Is this the most out there Apple product launch you can remember?
[8157.94 → 8158.38] Man,
[8158.42 → 8160.22] you sure picked a meaty topic.
[8160.38 → 8160.64] Hold on.
[8160.70 → 8161.76] Let's finish this off.
[8162.36 → 8162.96] All right.
[8162.96 → 8163.88] There we go.
[8166.70 → 8167.58] Oh my God.
[8167.62 → 8169.36] I have new terms and conditions to accept.
[8169.56 → 8169.80] Okay.
[8171.40 → 8171.96] Yep.
[8172.06 → 8172.44] I'm good.
[8173.26 → 8173.46] Oh,
[8173.52 → 8173.90] where'd it go?
[8175.68 → 8176.62] View terms.
[8177.36 → 8177.86] Oh my God.
[8179.40 → 8179.94] Okay.
[8181.12 → 8182.22] Require password.
[8182.56 → 8182.82] Okay.
[8182.96 → 8183.52] Subscriptions.
[8185.02 → 8185.54] Seriously.
[8185.94 → 8186.44] I just,
[8186.56 → 8187.60] I just signed in.
[8188.28 → 8188.62] Uh,
[8189.02 → 8192.10] round two.
[8192.10 → 8192.84] Oh boy.
[8192.96 → 8194.52] Okay.
[8195.08 → 8195.48] Okay.
[8195.52 → 8195.88] You know what?
[8195.90 → 8196.48] It doesn't matter.
[8196.56 → 8198.56] The point is it was there.
[8199.24 → 8200.20] It was there.
[8200.44 → 8201.40] So that's good.
[8208.56 → 8209.44] Tell me something,
[8209.56 → 8209.76] Luke.
[8210.70 → 8211.80] In fairness to me,
[8211.84 → 8212.80] would you have found that?
[8214.02 → 8214.38] What?
[8215.14 → 8215.68] Would you have,
[8215.74 → 8217.80] would you have found where to manage your subscriptions?
[8217.80 → 8218.52] Where was it?
[8219.18 → 8220.56] It's under users and accounts.
[8220.72 → 8222.04] And then you click on your name.
[8223.92 → 8224.24] Uh,
[8224.96 → 8226.42] you go down to subscriptions.
[8229.12 → 8231.86] Where would you have looked to unsubscribe from Apple?
[8231.86 → 8233.40] I would have gone into settings.
[8233.98 → 8234.62] Would you have,
[8234.66 → 8235.86], or would you have gone to Apple Arcade?
[8237.36 → 8237.80] Uh,
[8237.82 → 8238.62] that's a good point.
[8238.62 → 8239.58] I would have done settings.
[8239.82 → 8240.18] Probably.
[8240.54 → 8240.70] Okay.
[8240.84 → 8242.64] I immediately went to settings when I turned it on.
[8244.14 → 8247.20] Because that would be where I would manage my account.
[8247.64 → 8248.00] Sure.
[8248.48 → 8249.76] Where did you subscribe to it?
[8249.82 → 8251.60] Did you subscribe to it in the Apple Arcade app?
[8251.92 → 8252.18] No,
[8252.46 → 8254.22] I subscribed to it on my phone.
[8254.54 → 8254.90] Okay.
[8255.00 → 8256.54] Then I might go to settings.
[8256.58 → 8258.94] Getting subscribed to it was a pain in the butt for some reason.
[8259.02 → 8259.64] I forget why.
[8259.72 → 8259.96] Okay.
[8260.02 → 8261.46] Because I didn't have an iPhone on me.
[8261.68 → 8261.82] Yeah.
[8261.82 → 8262.70] I might go to settings then.
[8262.76 → 8263.72] I would scroll down from here.
[8263.76 → 8265.36] I wouldn't immediately go to users and accounts.
[8265.50 → 8266.18] I would scroll down.
[8267.42 → 8267.88] And I would look,
[8267.96 → 8268.10] look,
[8268.14 → 8268.34] look.
[8268.44 → 8268.70] Okay.
[8268.72 → 8270.34] Then I would probably go to users and accounts.
[8270.40 → 8270.56] Yeah.
[8270.56 → 8273.40] I would want a subscription in that menu immediately.
[8274.06 → 8276.34] I don't know that I would click on my user.
[8276.50 → 8276.58] No.
[8276.74 → 8277.32] Absolutely not.
[8277.58 → 8277.80] No,
[8277.90 → 8278.18] I would,
[8278.26 → 8280.00] I would get here, and then I'd probably go,
[8280.12 → 8281.80] and then I must have missed something.
[8281.80 → 8283.50] And I think that's exactly what I did too.
[8284.24 → 8284.56] Uh,
[8284.56 → 8285.38] this doesn't look right.
[8285.70 → 8285.92] Yeah.
[8286.00 → 8286.56] And then leave.
[8287.04 → 8287.66] And then what?
[8287.72 → 8289.04] You want to go into game centre now,
[8289.04 → 8291.06] now that you figured out that you need to click on your name?
[8292.38 → 8293.66] You go down to subscriptions.
[8294.02 → 8294.38] Okay.
[8295.84 → 8298.08] Is game centre the thing that you were subscribed to?
[8298.22 → 8298.48] No.
[8298.88 → 8299.12] Oh,
[8299.20 → 8300.86] I don't remember what game centre is.
[8300.90 → 8301.80] It's something else entirely.
[8301.96 → 8302.20] Okay.
[8302.22 → 8302.46] Sure.
[8302.92 → 8303.12] Yeah.
[8303.12 → 8303.62] It's like,
[8303.64 → 8303.94] uh,
[8303.94 → 8307.22] you can friend people, and you can play mobile games together or something like that.
[8307.26 → 8307.46] I can't,
[8307.46 → 8309.62] I can't remember exactly what it does or ever.
[8309.62 → 8309.90] Sure.
[8310.04 → 8310.24] Or did.
[8310.72 → 8313.04] So in conclusion,
[8313.04 → 8318.94] I didn't find it.
[8319.94 → 8324.38] It either moved or it was always there, or it was a regional difference, or it wasn't.
[8325.30 → 8326.78] And outside of that,
[8326.78 → 8336.24] the resources that I could find from Apple's own website did not direct me to a meaningful way to get it cancelled.
[8336.62 → 8344.86] So here was another person who was trying to do the same thing that I was and who was directed to this help article,
[8344.86 → 8349.70] which included no information about how to do it on an Apple TV.
[8350.80 → 8352.68] In order to do it on a Windows computer,
[8352.68 → 8354.38] I needed to use iTunes.
[8354.94 → 8356.22] And in order to access,
[8356.44 → 8358.18] and in order to remove my credit card,
[8358.40 → 8360.16] I needed to change my,
[8360.28 → 8362.24] my family sharing,
[8362.42 → 8364.86] which it didn't direct me how to do.
[8364.92 → 8366.08] And then now I know how to do.
[8366.18 → 8371.02] I actually had no idea that you have to do that by signing in to iCloud,
[8371.28 → 8373.26] which is great.
[8373.34 → 8374.24] I would never have done that.
[8374.24 → 8376.34] Now I know that.
[8377.30 → 8381.16] So I retract what I said about it not being there.
[8381.46 → 8385.06] I maintain what I said about it not, not immersed in the Apple ecosystem.
[8385.48 → 8386.82] Just to balance the tables out.
[8387.02 → 8388.42] Should you show your Windows search thing?
[8389.96 → 8390.48] No,
[8390.66 → 8391.26] that doesn't matter.
[8391.54 → 8391.78] Okay.
[8391.80 → 8392.20] That was,
[8392.28 → 8393.42] I was just Memling with you guys.
[8393.74 → 8394.42] It was pretty fun.
[8394.46 → 8395.22] I searched for,
[8395.30 → 8399.84] I searched for sleep because I just reformatted my desktop.
[8400.56 → 8401.20] Just to,
[8401.28 → 8401.66] just to,
[8401.66 → 8404.18] to make it clear that I hate Windows just as much.
[8404.24 → 8405.60] As I hate anything that Apple does.
[8406.20 → 8406.56] I,
[8406.76 → 8412.16] I searched for sleep in the start menu because I wanted to tell my computer not to go to sleep.
[8412.16 → 8414.06] Sometimes Cause I need to remote into my workstation.
[8414.18 → 8414.90] I just reformatted.
[8414.90 → 8417.38] And the result was,
[8417.38 → 8418.16] I can,
[8418.24 → 8419.24] I can show on my laptop.
[8419.24 → 8419.36] Oh,
[8419.42 → 8419.64] if you,
[8419.64 → 8420.40] if you have it up,
[8420.46 → 8422.16] then by all means go ahead and share it.
[8422.16 → 8422.30] No,
[8422.34 → 8423.86] so this isn't the exact same.
[8424.22 → 8425.56] So if I searched it on my laptop,
[8425.56 → 8428.70] it shows view recent sleep time and then sleep country Canada.
[8428.70 → 8430.16] In his example,
[8430.66 → 8432.32] view recent sleep time was not there.
[8432.80 → 8433.08] Uh,
[8433.08 → 8433.38] it was,
[8433.50 → 8435.30] it was just sleep country Canada.
[8435.46 → 8437.62] So if he typed sleep and then quickly press enter,
[8437.62 → 8438.36] it would have just,
[8438.56 → 8441.48] it would have just like Googled sleep country Canada.
[8441.74 → 8442.46] If I send,
[8442.46 → 8442.98] which is hilarious.
[8442.98 → 8444.06] If I send this to you,
[8444.06 → 8444.30] Dan,
[8444.38 → 8445.38] can you put it on screen?
[8446.34 → 8446.78] Uh,
[8446.92 → 8447.38] yes,
[8447.40 → 8448.08] I should be able to.
[8448.20 → 8448.48] Okay.
[8448.60 → 8448.92] Uh,
[8448.92 → 8450.58] how do I send it to you in a convenient way?
[8450.58 → 8450.86] Teams.
[8451.20 → 8451.40] Oh,
[8451.40 → 8451.60] okay.
[8451.60 → 8452.44] Then you already have it.
[8452.44 → 8453.90] Because it's in the topic approval chat.
[8453.94 → 8454.14] Oh no,
[8454.16 → 8455.42] you're not in the topic approval chat.
[8456.06 → 8456.38] Okay.
[8456.44 → 8456.72] All right.
[8456.72 → 8456.94] I will,
[8457.00 → 8457.90] I will send this to you.
[8457.96 → 8458.40] This is actually.
[8458.40 → 8458.98] Sancho crew.
[8459.16 → 8459.28] Yeah.
[8459.32 → 8459.62] I don't know.
[8459.72 → 8460.94] I'll send it to Sancho crew.
[8461.90 → 8463.54] Sleep country Canada.
[8463.98 → 8464.34] Yeah.
[8465.22 → 8468.14] You should probably buy a mattress somewhere else.
[8468.86 → 8469.30] I did.
[8469.76 → 8470.12] Nice.
[8472.18 → 8473.08] If you live up here,
[8473.12 → 8473.60] that's a jingle,
[8473.72 → 8474.02] you know,
[8474.66 → 8475.90] just how it works.
[8476.42 → 8476.66] Well,
[8476.66 → 8478.96] I think they have the same jingle in the U S Oh,
[8479.06 → 8480.70] but it was like sleep country USA.
[8480.70 → 8484.14] And I heard it once when I was like south of the border.
[8484.24 → 8485.04] It seems not fair.
[8485.14 → 8485.44] I was like,
[8485.48 → 8485.66] what?
[8485.94 → 8486.16] Yeah.
[8486.36 → 8486.64] Yeah.
[8486.80 → 8487.52] Uncanny Valley.
[8489.56 → 8489.92] Yeah.
[8490.02 → 8491.00] It feels gross.
[8491.68 → 8492.64] I don't like that.
[8493.06 → 8493.22] Yeah.
[8493.22 → 8493.90] It's our jingle.
[8495.52 → 8497.22] Image button file,
[8497.90 → 8498.40] not found.
[8498.50 → 8498.72] I don't,
[8498.78 → 8500.04] I didn't attach a file.
[8501.00 → 8501.88] I know what I'm doing.
[8501.96 → 8502.30] I don't know.
[8502.74 → 8503.68] In fairness to Apple,
[8503.68 → 8506.02] it was like the middle of the night when I was trying to do this too.
[8507.12 → 8510.68] And I think that a lot of my frustration was already teed up.
[8510.70 → 8513.60] From trying to get signed in to that bloody thing without an iPhone.
[8515.50 → 8517.98] Which was a really frustrating experience as well.
[8518.26 → 8519.12] In iTunes,
[8519.26 → 8521.16] there's no way to manage your family group,
[8521.24 → 8521.66] by the way.
[8522.06 → 8523.40] So that was really annoying.
[8524.04 → 8524.78] I just,
[8525.10 → 8529.76] it was a more frustrating experience than in my opinion,
[8529.76 → 8530.36] it should be.
[8530.46 → 8532.44] I don't think subscriptions should be buried anywhere.
[8532.58 → 8533.52] I think they should be super,
[8533.70 → 8534.54] super easy to find.
[8534.82 → 8535.52] Speaking of which,
[8535.56 → 8536.82] I need to cancel my subscription.
[8537.56 → 8538.58] Cause you just started.
[8538.58 → 8539.50] Yeah.
[8539.54 → 8540.76] Because I just started it again.
[8540.84 → 8541.42] I've got the
[8541.42 → 8542.10] the picture ready.
[8542.26 → 8544.86] I played Fantasia exactly the number of times I need to play it,
[8544.92 → 8546.40] which is 90 point,
[8546.52 → 8547.06] point nine,
[8547.14 → 8547.76] nine times.
[8548.10 → 8550.10] I only haven't finished the second,
[8550.32 → 8552.46] the third phase of the final boss.
[8553.00 → 8553.88] I got through the
[8553.98 → 8554.88] played it point nine,
[8554.94 → 8555.40] nine times.
[8555.66 → 8555.90] Yeah.
[8556.90 → 8557.26] Oh,
[8557.26 → 8558.22] like played it through.
[8558.30 → 8558.52] Yeah.
[8558.78 → 8559.06] Oh,
[8559.18 → 8560.20] I'm just going to fade it in.
[8560.66 → 8561.08] There you go.
[8561.22 → 8561.60] There you go.
[8561.60 → 8566.06] That is the result for sleep on my brand-new windows install.
[8566.06 → 8572.38] It tries to autocorrect it to sleep country Canada and it best matches to sleep country Canada.
[8572.92 → 8573.84] That's absurd.
[8577.64 → 8579.16] I hate current year.
[8579.28 → 8579.84] That's absurd.
[8580.02 → 8580.50] Settings,
[8580.76 → 8581.24] nightlight.
[8581.98 → 8582.30] Really?
[8583.58 → 8584.66] That's the setting.
[8584.84 → 8586.66] They got rid of this computer.
[8586.86 → 8588.14] So you can't search this computer.
[8588.28 → 8589.24] Why is it nested?
[8589.82 → 8591.04] Why is that nested,
[8591.16 → 8591.32] Dan?
[8591.48 → 8592.32] I don't know.
[8592.54 → 8593.38] I hate it.
[8593.78 → 8594.54] How is this,
[8594.62 → 8595.26] this bad?
[8595.64 → 8597.60] I wish I could pay more for no ads.
[8598.42 → 8599.90] There should be no ads in windows.
[8600.62 → 8601.14] I mean,
[8601.14 → 8603.00] especially because we do pay for it.
[8603.68 → 8603.92] Yeah.
[8604.68 → 8606.50] This is unbelievable.
[8606.50 → 8619.00] The fact that everyone knows what a complete useless meme windows searches and the fact that it doesn't improve indicates that this is Microsoft's
[8619.00 → 8620.60] desired behaviour for it.
[8620.86 → 8621.06] Yeah.
[8621.18 → 8621.56] To me.
[8621.78 → 8622.40] And there's a whole,
[8622.56 → 8625.70] there are so many settings in windows dedicated to sleep.
[8626.30 → 8626.74] Yeah.
[8626.92 → 8628.12] Like so many.
[8628.18 → 8629.70] Like how about sleep?
[8630.96 → 8631.40] Yeah.
[8631.80 → 8632.20] Yeah.
[8632.80 → 8633.24] Yeah.
[8633.24 → 8633.36] Yeah.
[8635.36 → 8636.22] Now I'm angry.
[8636.64 → 8637.50] That's a bug.
[8637.68 → 8638.46] Check windows admin.
[8638.60 → 8639.34] I don't believe you.
[8639.82 → 8644.14] I've seen it on basically every Windows machine I've touched in the last few years.
[8644.14 → 8644.70] I,
[8644.80 → 8645.16] it's,
[8645.26 → 8646.84] if it's a bug,
[8646.86 → 8648.92] it's one that exists on purpose at this point.
[8648.92 → 8649.38] I'm sorry.
[8650.32 → 8652.10] I'm not even shopping for a mattress.
[8652.64 → 8653.78] Get better Intel.
[8656.04 → 8656.52] Uh,
[8656.56 → 8657.12] all right.
[8657.58 → 8658.04] Yeah.
[8658.10 → 8659.46] Advertise better nerds.
[8660.48 → 8661.14] All right.
[8661.40 → 8661.68] Apple,
[8661.68 → 8662.26] uh,
[8662.26 → 8663.14] Apple vision pro.
[8664.94 → 8665.86] I did the intro.
[8666.12 → 8667.40] I want to try it.
[8667.48 → 8667.92] I haven't,
[8668.04 → 8669.56] I haven't gotten a chance to yet.
[8669.62 → 8674.12] The thing is Apple only seeds to media that they use.
[8674.12 → 8675.00] They get along with,
[8675.16 → 8675.62] which I,
[8675.92 → 8676.14] you know,
[8676.18 → 8677.58] is a thing.
[8678.02 → 8678.46] Um,
[8678.74 → 8684.86] and being in Canada and not being one of the first people to click the button,
[8685.06 → 8685.56] um,
[8685.58 → 8689.04] our unit isn't arriving until I think Monday.
[8689.66 → 8691.74] So I haven't tried it yet.
[8691.82 → 8692.30] I,
[8693.26 → 8694.04] the way that,
[8694.20 → 8695.96] the way that it looks to me from the outside,
[8696.08 → 8699.12] I've actually tried not to find out too much.
[8699.26 → 8700.16] Like I just,
[8700.28 → 8703.34] sometimes I can't help it, and I'll click an article, and I'll read some of it.
[8703.34 → 8704.66] Or I just,
[8705.06 → 8706.60] yeah,
[8706.60 → 8707.28] mostly that.
[8707.68 → 8708.06] Um,
[8708.46 → 8708.96] or I did,
[8709.00 → 8710.34] I did watch the one Apple,
[8710.34 → 8710.98] uh,
[8710.98 → 8714.66] promotional video where she's like packing for a trip or something like that.
[8714.66 → 8716.78] And she's wearing a vision pro headset for some reason.
[8717.16 → 8717.56] Uh,
[8717.56 → 8719.30] so I have been exposed to some stuff,
[8719.38 → 8723.22] but I've been trying to keep my reactions as raw as possible.
[8723.22 → 8725.88] Because we're going to shoot a short circuit on Monday when it comes in.
[8725.88 → 8727.58] And then after that,
[8727.58 → 8729.28] my main mission,
[8729.42 → 8735.46] I think is going to be to figure out how to use it.
[8736.50 → 8738.62] As a non Apple user,
[8738.62 → 8746.20] I've certainly had my frustrations using the Apple products that I do daily drive.
[8746.20 → 8746.60] I mean,
[8746.90 → 8748.38] I've talked about this one before,
[8748.38 → 8748.76] but you know,
[8748.80 → 8752.16] there's absolutely no way to update the firmware on AirPods without an iPhone,
[8752.28 → 8752.48] right?
[8753.20 → 8753.52] No,
[8753.80 → 8754.56] you cannot.
[8757.56 → 8758.22] That's sick.
[8758.26 → 8759.06] Not through iTunes,
[8759.30 → 8760.20] not through iCloud.
[8760.56 → 8761.18] This one,
[8761.26 → 8763.20] I'm sure about you simply can't.
[8763.20 → 8764.20] Um,
[8765.24 → 8765.46] and,
[8765.58 → 8770.94] and there's also features that are extremely inconvenient or impossible to change depending
[8770.94 → 8771.60] on how,
[8772.14 → 8772.32] uh,
[8772.32 → 8774.88] like I think there's third party apps that have managed to,
[8774.88 → 8775.70] uh,
[8775.74 → 8775.94] you know,
[8775.94 → 8778.52] change what the long press does and stuff like that.
[8778.52 → 8778.88] Oh,
[8778.90 → 8780.18] except if you have an iPad.
[8780.34 → 8780.46] Oh,
[8780.54 → 8781.16] I'm sorry.
[8781.26 → 8783.90] A big iPhone will also solve the problem for you.
[8784.78 → 8785.22] Um,
[8786.78 → 8792.28] apparently you better have an iPhone or you won't be able to use the vision pro properly.
[8792.28 → 8794.46] I think I have a 13 pro at home somewhere.
[8794.66 → 8796.58] I will have to check unless,
[8796.72 → 8798.38] unless I have it with me.
[8799.04 → 8799.40] Um,
[8800.50 → 8805.70] no,
[8805.74 → 8806.20] I don't have it.
[8806.20 → 8807.06] I used to be a big,
[8807.10 → 8808.58] like always two phones guys.
[8808.64 → 8810.20] Like I'd have one in my side pocket,
[8810.28 → 8811.20] one in my back pocket.
[8811.66 → 8812.82] And over the years,
[8812.82 → 8816.02] I found that whether I'm on an iPhone or whether I'm on an Android phone,
[8816.04 → 8817.20] I just don't really need it anymore.
[8818.20 → 8820.70] Either of them can kind of do everything.
[8820.70 → 8825.58] And people who have this kind of super intense brand loyalty one way or the other,
[8825.58 → 8826.50] I think they just haven't,
[8826.58 → 8828.78] I think they just haven't tried the other in a while.
[8828.90 → 8831.78] So the one way or the other is an important point because run,
[8831.84 → 8832.98] John just said in full plane chat,
[8833.04 → 8835.90] I can't update my Samsung earbuds on my iPhone either.
[8837.32 → 8837.72] Really?
[8837.98 → 8839.08] But what about on a computer?
[8839.86 → 8840.42] I don't know.
[8840.42 → 8845.30] You can only do it on an Android device.
[8846.30 → 8846.74] That's,
[8846.82 → 8847.70] they didn't say that.
[8847.82 → 8848.44] They didn't say that.
[8848.50 → 8848.66] Oh,
[8848.78 → 8848.94] don't,
[8849.04 → 8850.12] don't hamburger this hot dog.
[8850.28 → 8850.56] Okay.
[8850.68 → 8851.78] Because that would be stupid.
[8852.50 → 8852.68] Yeah.
[8854.48 → 8855.92] They just said no iPhone.
[8858.72 → 8859.16] Sheesh.
[8859.74 → 8860.14] Can you,
[8860.30 → 8862.12] can you do AirPods on a PC or Android?
[8862.22 → 8862.38] No,
[8862.88 → 8863.28] no,
[8863.32 → 8864.06] you can't.
[8864.06 → 8864.58] Um,
[8864.82 → 8869.38] we'll see if there is,
[8869.50 → 8869.76] you can,
[8869.84 → 8871.92] but you have to install Samsung's iTunes.
[8872.06 → 8872.24] Okay.
[8872.28 → 8872.42] No,
[8872.44 → 8872.96] that's a joke.
[8873.22 → 8873.84] Very funny.
[8873.88 → 8874.22] You guys,
[8875.16 → 8875.26] yeah,
[8875.26 → 8876.50] you have to use their where app.
[8876.66 → 8877.70] A handyman said,
[8877.84 → 8878.02] well,
[8878.10 → 8882.86] that is equally stupid, and I hate it just as much.
[8883.36 → 8883.76] Yeah.
[8884.84 → 8885.56] All right.
[8886.12 → 8887.00] What else we got?
[8889.18 → 8889.54] Uh,
[8890.14 → 8891.46] did we talk enough about vision pro?
[8891.92 → 8892.32] Oh,
[8892.44 → 8892.84] right.
[8892.84 → 8893.16] Yeah.
[8893.18 → 8895.36] So I'm trying to figure out what it's for.
[8895.58 → 8896.98] It's obviously not for gaming.
[8897.36 → 8899.04] I think it's monitor replacement.
[8899.30 → 8899.74] Sure.
[8899.88 → 8901.94] So it's a $3,500 monitor.
[8902.90 → 8906.06] It's a $3,500 monitor that you could have in scenarios,
[8906.20 → 8907.14] but you can't have a monitor.
[8907.82 → 8908.26] Yeah,
[8908.46 → 8909.12] I think is,
[8909.22 → 8909.70] is it.
[8910.00 → 8910.28] I mean,
[8910.28 → 8917.84] one of the ideas I had for the video was just meeting the monitor off my desk at work and only using the vision pro as a monitor.
[8918.06 → 8920.16] I think you should use it in more scenarios than that.
[8920.56 → 8922.02] I think you should have,
[8922.02 → 8922.82] uh,
[8922.84 → 8924.42] like Yvonne drive the car.
[8925.60 → 8925.84] Mm-hmm.
[8925.84 → 8927.30] And you work on your laptop.
[8927.30 → 8928.08] I thought you were going to say,
[8928.18 → 8929.30] and wear the vision pro.
[8929.46 → 8929.66] No.
[8929.78 → 8930.10] Okay.
[8930.38 → 8930.62] Yeah.
[8930.70 → 8931.06] I mean,
[8931.06 → 8932.50] based on their low latency pass through,
[8932.60 → 8934.02] it feels like that might be possible.
[8934.56 → 8934.96] Um,
[8934.96 → 8936.48] but I'm not suggesting that you do it.
[8936.56 → 8936.72] Cool.
[8936.86 → 8938.42] That might also be literally illegal.
[8938.42 → 8939.42] I would think so.
[8939.42 → 8940.18] I would hope so,
[8940.24 → 8940.66] to be honest.
[8940.66 → 8940.82] Yeah.
[8941.20 → 8941.64] Um,
[8941.78 → 8943.02] but,
[8943.20 → 8943.62] uh,
[8943.66 → 8943.92] yeah,
[8943.96 → 8944.22] no,
[8944.34 → 8944.88] uh,
[8944.88 → 8947.48] if you're going on a trip sometime,
[8947.76 → 8954.54] wear it on a plane and have set up a bunch of monitors instead of your laptop and see if it's interestingly productive.
[8955.54 → 8955.94] Um,
[8956.38 → 8959.08] and I can only use it with a MacBook.
[8959.80 → 8960.40] All right.
[8960.72 → 8961.38] Is that true?
[8961.62 → 8961.92] Well,
[8961.96 → 8962.14] I've,
[8962.20 → 8962.74] I'm already,
[8962.74 → 8965.40] I'm already preparing myself to go back to the MacBook.
[8967.54 → 8969.08] Return of the Mac.
[8969.20 → 8969.84] One second.
[8969.84 → 8970.36] I mean,
[8970.36 → 8971.96] MacBooks are kind of killing it right now.
[8972.16 → 8972.30] Oh,
[8972.40 → 8972.70] I mean,
[8972.76 → 8972.94] yeah,
[8973.02 → 8973.20] no,
[8973.26 → 8973.80] no question.
[8973.92 → 8974.22] It's just,
[8974.36 → 8974.52] yeah.
[8974.72 → 8975.38] And you know,
[8975.42 → 8975.98] what's really,
[8976.08 → 8977.72] fascinating.
[8977.96 → 8985.60] I think if you were to plot the amount of time that it takes me to go from completely fresh installation.
[8985.60 → 8990.74] First time I've seen the desktop to my computer is fully set up, and I can do everything I need on it.
[8990.90 → 8993.78] It would look like this.
[8995.56 → 8996.16] When I,
[8996.48 → 8997.60] that fresh format,
[8997.60 → 9001.92] I was ready to do basic things on it in about four minutes.
[9002.38 → 9002.74] Oh,
[9002.92 → 9003.48] and I was,
[9003.60 → 9004.06] and I'm,
[9004.26 → 9006.30] and I'm ready to do pretty much anything.
[9006.30 → 9007.88] And I'm talking drivers are installed.
[9008.44 → 9008.58] So,
[9008.74 → 9009.64] so not that.
[9010.16 → 9011.64] And then beyond that,
[9011.74 → 9016.78] probably about another 10 minutes and I can do 98% of what I need to do on it.
[9017.22 → 9017.96] And there's,
[9018.06 → 9020.24] there are things that I would set up on my personal machine,
[9020.24 → 9021.00] uh,
[9021.00 → 9024.12] or there's tinker things that obviously I haven't bothered with.
[9024.16 → 9024.40] Like,
[9024.44 → 9024.70] uh,
[9024.70 → 9024.80] I,
[9024.90 → 9025.00] okay,
[9025.02 → 9027.50] I want to play around with Nvidia's AI.
[9027.60 → 9029.12] HDR conversion,
[9029.26 → 9029.88] Tomfoolery.
[9030.00 → 9030.40] And yeah,
[9030.40 → 9030.58] sure.
[9030.58 → 9035.40] That's the kind of thing that obviously takes a little bit longer to get everything dialled in exactly how you like it.
[9035.40 → 9040.28] But that computer was completely usable for me to do my job in like 15 minutes.
[9040.46 → 9040.60] Yeah.
[9040.74 → 9046.90] And that's assuming that the writing team keeps using the office suite instead of switching over to Google docs,
[9046.90 → 9048.84] which is something that we may do in the near future.
[9049.46 → 9052.12] So having just gone through that experience,
[9052.12 → 9053.12] I'm kind of sitting here going,
[9053.36 → 9056.10] okay,
[9056.30 → 9057.52] uh,
[9057.60 → 9059.98] what exactly would prevent me from using a MacBook then?
[9059.98 → 9067.30] Because almost all of it is either cloud-based or something that I could easily install on a Mac.
[9067.54 → 9069.78] It's not like teams doesn't exist for Mac.
[9071.62 → 9072.06] Yeah.
[9072.82 → 9075.90] Teams makes me want to throw it through a wall anyway.
[9076.04 → 9078.08] So maybe I should do the Apple challenge again.
[9078.40 → 9078.64] Maybe,
[9078.76 → 9079.72] maybe I should just switch.
[9079.90 → 9080.22] Maybe.
[9080.66 → 9081.48] Why am I?
[9081.64 → 9082.86] As much as I don't want to,
[9082.98 → 9084.66] I know it would be fine for me.
[9084.90 → 9087.02] I work almost exclusively in browsers.
[9087.66 → 9088.76] Why would it matter for me?
[9088.84 → 9089.18] Well,
[9089.84 → 9092.84] you'd go to do a thing, and you'd be like,
[9093.32 → 9094.50] why can't I do this thing?
[9094.94 → 9095.56] It'll happen.
[9097.30 → 9098.38] I'm sure it'll happen.
[9098.52 → 9098.70] Yeah.
[9098.70 → 9099.44] For work though.
[9099.56 → 9099.94] Honestly.
[9100.10 → 9104.44] Like one of the ones that drove me crazy last time was how poorly it handles mapped network drives.
[9105.04 → 9105.96] It was just a nightmare.
[9106.40 → 9107.18] So stupid.
[9107.90 → 9108.04] No,
[9108.10 → 9108.88] why don't you get a Thunderbolt?
[9108.88 → 9110.34] Why don't you get Thunderbolt?
[9110.94 → 9111.16] Like,
[9111.24 → 9111.46] no,
[9111.86 → 9113.92] Thunderbolt is a stupid solution for,
[9113.92 → 9115.42] uh,
[9115.50 → 9116.06] for that.
[9116.16 → 9118.52] Like direct attached storage in general is just a stupid solution.
[9118.60 → 9118.94] I'm sorry.
[9119.16 → 9120.52] I'm completely over it.
[9121.22 → 9121.66] Um,
[9121.74 → 9122.18] apparently,
[9122.32 → 9122.66] by the way,
[9122.70 → 9127.30] someone did drive with the Apple vision pro and did get pulled over and got arrested.
[9127.68 → 9128.12] Well,
[9128.18 → 9128.88] pulled over at least.
[9130.48 → 9131.90] Why does that not surprise me?
[9131.96 → 9132.38] That's fun.
[9134.14 → 9134.58] Um,
[9134.58 → 9137.88] I'm being told that you can only do one monitor replacement with it.
[9138.12 → 9138.48] Um,
[9138.48 → 9141.78] I know I saw people with more than that of screen.
[9141.88 → 9145.34] So maybe you can do one monitor replacement and then other apps around it.
[9146.02 → 9146.46] Um,
[9146.60 → 9149.36] why on earth would they care how many monitors you replace with it?
[9149.38 → 9150.26] I guess it would have,
[9150.52 → 9152.68] it would come down to how macOS handles.
[9152.88 → 9153.20] Maybe.
[9154.06 → 9155.40] Display management or something.
[9155.48 → 9156.18] I have no clue.
[9156.28 → 9157.88] Which was awful last time I used it,
[9157.92 → 9158.32] by the way.
[9158.36 → 9159.46] It was just like terrible.
[9159.76 → 9160.58] It's like just clone window,
[9160.68 → 9161.62] just clone arrow snap.
[9161.62 → 9164.60] I'm talking specifically for the laptop usage,
[9164.72 → 9165.10] by the way.
[9165.36 → 9165.54] Yeah.
[9165.68 → 9165.92] Oh,
[9165.98 → 9166.18] okay.
[9166.28 → 9166.78] What I'm saying,
[9166.88 → 9167.00] I,
[9167.08 → 9168.66] I'm sure I'd be fine on a MacBook.
[9168.90 → 9171.30] I'm saying just to replace the laptop that I have.
[9171.40 → 9171.64] Oh,
[9171.68 → 9171.92] I see.
[9172.00 → 9173.28] I would still need the desktop.
[9173.52 → 9173.82] A hundred percent.
[9173.92 → 9174.08] Okay.
[9174.14 → 9174.38] Okay.
[9174.44 → 9174.68] Okay.
[9174.68 → 9175.10] I understand.
[9175.44 → 9175.68] Yeah.
[9175.68 → 9176.82] I would be going just,
[9176.92 → 9177.96] I use a MacBook now.
[9178.08 → 9178.22] Yeah.
[9178.24 → 9178.38] See,
[9178.42 → 9178.66] that's,
[9178.72 → 9179.58] that's a little bit more drastic.
[9179.58 → 9181.20] If I was just replacing my laptop,
[9181.40 → 9181.78] genuinely,
[9181.78 → 9183.10] I think it would be completely fine.
[9184.94 → 9185.38] Yeah.
[9185.42 → 9185.62] Okay.
[9185.62 → 9187.14] So apps can be the other ones.
[9187.26 → 9192.96] You can only screen share one MacBook screen and that's at 1440 P, apparently.
[9193.42 → 9193.70] Okay.
[9193.70 → 9193.80] That's what,
[9193.80 → 9194.40] that's what Chad's saying.
[9194.40 → 9194.54] I mean,
[9194.56 → 9194.90] that seems,
[9195.02 → 9195.52] which I believe.
[9196.36 → 9196.80] Yeah.
[9197.18 → 9197.98] And Matt,
[9198.10 → 9200.06] who was doing monitor replacement,
[9200.26 → 9202.36] Matt from the labs web development team,
[9202.36 → 9207.14] who was doing monitor replacement sometime last week with a quest,
[9207.14 → 9208.76] had three monitors on the quest.
[9209.46 → 9210.92] So it is kind of a weird limitation.
[9211.64 → 9212.48] And I wonder if you're right.
[9212.56 → 9213.76] I wonder if it's something to do with macOS.
[9214.50 → 9215.06] I don't know.
[9215.12 → 9215.46] No idea.
[9215.58 → 9215.80] I mean,
[9215.82 → 9219.22] these are all things that I guess I'm going to get to discover because the main question,
[9219.30 → 9219.40] right?
[9219.42 → 9221.84] Because everyone in their dog who's,
[9222.10 → 9222.32] Oh,
[9222.32 → 9223.36] it's based on the display.
[9223.48 → 9223.60] Yeah.
[9223.60 → 9223.78] See,
[9223.86 → 9223.98] I,
[9224.06 → 9224.88] I don't know.
[9224.94 → 9225.10] Don't,
[9225.16 → 9225.34] don't,
[9225.34 → 9227.84] don't take the things that I'm reading from Chad is like a hundred percent fact.
[9227.92 → 9229.46] It's just interesting to discuss.
[9229.58 → 9232.54] Everyone in their dog whose Mac friendly has already looked at this thing.
[9232.66 → 9234.62] So if we're going to make a video about it,
[9234.64 → 9235.88] it has to be from the angle of,
[9235.98 → 9236.04] okay,
[9236.04 → 9237.20] but hold on a second.
[9237.26 → 9238.66] What if you're more like me?
[9239.42 → 9242.46] Should this be interesting to you at all?
[9242.54 → 9248.16] Or should you be just be waiting for a second or third generation clone from a PC company
[9248.16 → 9249.94] that kind of works or something?
[9250.56 → 9250.68] Yeah.
[9251.26 → 9252.96] And I think the answer is going to be,
[9253.14 → 9256.84] you don't need to care about this right now,
[9256.84 → 9259.84] unless you're willing to switch into the ecosystem.
[9259.84 → 9261.50] So then my question becomes,
[9261.62 → 9263.38] is it worth it?
[9265.26 → 9267.96] They're asking for a pretty big outlay.
[9268.18 → 9268.36] Yeah.
[9268.84 → 9269.12] I mean,
[9269.16 → 9270.24] it's that being said,
[9270.30 → 9275.40] I think they're going to have a bunch of tech people that are going to be happy to jump
[9275.40 → 9275.72] into it.
[9275.72 → 9277.48] Wasn't Google last like a thousand dollars,
[9277.72 → 9279.36] something like that.
[9279.36 → 9280.98] I forget what Google Glass,
[9281.08 → 9281.52] uh,
[9283.82 → 9286.80] Google Glass announcement price.
[9286.98 → 9290.32] I find people have a very intriguing amount of money whenever there's something interesting
[9290.32 → 9290.64] to buy.
[9290.72 → 9290.80] Yeah.
[9290.80 → 9291.56] It was a thousand dollars.
[9291.56 → 9295.84] And do you remember how many people were wearing Google Glass at CES that year?
[9296.24 → 9296.36] Everywhere.
[9296.48 → 9297.94] They were freaking everywhere.
[9298.58 → 9299.16] And I just,
[9299.26 → 9300.34] I couldn't believe it.
[9300.36 → 9300.72] I was like,
[9300.76 → 9302.72] I bought one of these because it's my job.
[9302.84 → 9304.78] I used it for a while and was like,
[9305.10 → 9305.50] okay,
[9305.60 → 9306.68] I have used it now.
[9306.80 → 9308.74] It's pretty useless.
[9308.86 → 9310.26] And now it goes in a pile.
[9310.64 → 9312.56] And how are you people still wearing these?
[9312.58 → 9313.52] I don't understand this.
[9313.56 → 9314.96] And then by the following year,
[9315.30 → 9316.54] all of them were gone.
[9317.20 → 9317.32] I don't.
[9317.32 → 9320.00] S'more in chat is saying a thousand dollars is way different from $3,500.
[9321.14 → 9321.54] Yeah.
[9321.68 → 9322.06] Yeah,
[9322.18 → 9322.64] for sure.
[9322.76 → 9322.98] Sure.
[9323.30 → 9323.88] It's still,
[9323.92 → 9324.72] that's not my point.
[9324.92 → 9325.12] It's,
[9325.12 → 9325.58] it's also,
[9325.72 → 9331.48] I would say it's still in a range that like to spend that much money on something very
[9331.48 → 9332.34] fresh,
[9332.46 → 9335.86] experimental stuff like that is wild.
[9335.96 → 9338.50] It's asking a lot of those amounts are in the
[9338.76 → 9340.00] that's wild category.
[9340.36 → 9341.28] Are they the same?
[9341.38 → 9341.58] No,
[9341.62 → 9342.12] not at all.
[9342.18 → 9342.38] No,
[9343.22 → 9347.06] but like Google Glass was only five years ago.
[9347.84 → 9350.42] You have over a thousand dollars of throw it away.
[9350.42 → 9352.96] This might be complete trash spending money.
[9353.08 → 9353.30] Not even.
[9353.42 → 9354.50] It might be complete trash.
[9354.58 → 9355.68] I don't think it's going to be trash,
[9355.78 → 9359.64] but it might be sits in the box and doesn't get used.
[9359.88 → 9360.28] Yeah.
[9361.20 → 9361.90] The battery,
[9362.04 → 9362.26] man,
[9362.30 → 9364.40] the battery life is a big concern for me.
[9365.40 → 9365.60] I know.
[9365.60 → 9366.22] I get that.
[9366.30 → 9366.86] I get that.
[9366.92 → 9367.48] You can plug the pack in.
[9368.30 → 9368.62] Sure.
[9368.76 → 9370.10] Non-removable cable on the pack.
[9370.36 → 9371.22] Not true.
[9371.34 → 9371.48] No,
[9371.54 → 9372.14] it's removable.
[9372.48 → 9372.64] Yeah.
[9372.64 → 9372.92] Is it?
[9373.06 → 9375.68] It turns out it's like a jumbo lightning connector or something.
[9375.82 → 9375.88] Oh,
[9375.92 → 9376.60] that's sick.
[9376.70 → 9379.80] It's kind of like the non-removable cable on that iMac that we,
[9379.86 → 9380.34] Oh yeah.
[9380.34 → 9380.90] Yeah,
[9380.90 → 9381.10] yeah,
[9381.10 → 9381.40] yeah,
[9381.40 → 9381.60] yeah.
[9381.60 → 9382.56] Live on the WAN show.
[9382.68 → 9383.56] As far as my understanding goes,
[9383.64 → 9385.64] you just stick a thing in a hole and it pops out.
[9385.70 → 9385.80] Oh,
[9385.82 → 9386.24] that's awesome.
[9386.38 → 9386.52] Yeah.
[9386.54 → 9387.92] I'm actually really happy about that.
[9388.04 → 9390.34] That makes me feel better about the world.
[9390.58 → 9390.82] Yeah.
[9390.96 → 9391.20] It was lightning.
[9391.34 → 9391.48] I mean,
[9391.48 → 9393.88] it also just didn't need to be lightning at all.
[9394.56 → 9395.24] But hey,
[9395.34 → 9395.58] whatever,
[9395.68 → 9396.10] it's lightning.
[9396.36 → 9397.12] So that's something.
[9397.56 → 9397.68] Yeah.
[9399.06 → 9400.80] Five years ago was definitely not correct.
[9400.86 → 9401.04] Oh yeah,
[9401.08 → 9401.20] no,
[9401.24 → 9402.32] that wasn't five years ago.
[9402.38 → 9403.00] Hold on a second.
[9403.44 → 9403.60] Okay.
[9403.62 → 9404.16] What is this?
[9404.30 → 9404.80] Why am I?
[9405.08 → 9405.42] Oh,
[9406.14 → 9406.30] no,
[9406.40 → 9406.54] no,
[9406.54 → 9406.72] no,
[9406.72 → 9406.78] no,
[9406.78 → 9406.84] no,
[9406.84 → 9406.90] no,
[9406.90 → 9407.00] no,
[9407.00 → 9407.18] no,
[9407.18 → 9407.54] no,
[9407.54 → 9407.70] no,
[9407.70 → 9407.88] no,
[9407.88 → 9408.20] no,
[9408.20 → 9408.22] no,
[9408.22 → 9412.70] this is enterprise edition to announced for 999 in 2019.
[9412.70 → 9413.30] Hold on.
[9413.46 → 9414.32] Enterprise edition.
[9414.34 → 9415.02] Google Glass.
[9415.10 → 9415.50] Here we go.
[9415.60 → 9419.06] It was $1,500 in 2013.
[9419.26 → 9419.36] Yeah,
[9419.40 → 9420.18] it was 10 years ago.
[9420.36 → 9420.52] Yep.
[9420.64 → 9420.94] Here you go.
[9421.00 → 9421.68] Sorry about that guys.
[9426.34 → 9428.12] I'm excited about the display.
[9429.16 → 9429.52] Yeah.
[9429.52 → 9430.84] It's supposed to be amazing.
[9430.84 → 9432.50] Out of everything I care about.
[9432.62 → 9435.20] I think that's the one I care about most.
[9435.30 → 9436.76] Cause that means progress for all the headsets.
[9436.76 → 9441.00] And if I could just use my Windows computer with that display,
[9441.00 → 9444.34] that would kind of be my ideal while I wait for that.
[9444.34 → 9448.20] And that would also be a way that I could kind of justify it as well,
[9448.20 → 9452.48] because that,
[9452.62 → 9453.00] no,
[9453.08 → 9453.34] no,
[9453.42 → 9454.56] even then like that's a
[9454.56 → 9456.04] boy,
[9456.12 → 9457.72] is that an ever expensive monitor?
[9457.72 → 9458.44] Yeah.
[9460.88 → 9466.72] I do think a lot of travelling tech people will find a legitimate way
[9466.76 → 9467.88] to justify it.
[9467.96 → 9468.14] Yeah.
[9468.14 → 9468.76] It's going to be tough,
[9468.82 → 9468.98] man,
[9469.04 → 9469.18] dude,
[9469.24 → 9470.62] it's going to be tough at work too though.
[9470.70 → 9471.98] Cause even just for privacy reasons,
[9471.98 → 9474.20] I work collaboratively with people a lot.
[9474.74 → 9475.04] Yeah,
[9475.08 → 9475.52] you do.
[9475.54 → 9476.10] What am I going to,
[9476.34 → 9476.62] I know,
[9476.68 → 9476.90] I know.
[9477.00 → 9477.24] Well,
[9477.28 → 9477.44] yeah,
[9477.44 → 9478.30] but I'm reviewing it.
[9478.36 → 9479.10] So I'm trying to think like,
[9479.14 → 9480.78] what the heck am I going to use this thing for?
[9480.78 → 9482.84] I don't think it's for you to be completely honest.
[9482.84 → 9484.80] I mean,
[9484.82 → 9486.22] I want to like it, actually.
[9486.46 → 9487.58] I'm excited about it.
[9487.64 → 9488.60] I think it's really cool tech.
[9488.60 → 9492.00] But I don't think this particular device is going to be great for you.
[9492.18 → 9492.96] That being said,
[9493.12 → 9496.80] I do think you'd be able to see if it had value for other people.
[9496.86 → 9499.62] I don't think you're like not an applicable person to review it to be clear.
[9500.06 → 9501.12] I just don't think it's.
[9501.46 → 9501.64] Like,
[9501.78 → 9502.26] okay,
[9502.32 → 9503.08] here's one thing.
[9503.62 → 9505.52] I'm not going to get any calls on FaceTime.
[9506.36 → 9507.64] I don't know anybody with an iPhone.
[9508.42 → 9508.68] Yeah.
[9509.56 → 9511.12] That's one of the reasons why I wouldn't be for you,
[9511.46 → 9511.66] but.
[9511.86 → 9512.14] Well,
[9512.18 → 9512.30] yeah,
[9512.34 → 9512.96] but so I,
[9513.04 → 9514.22] how am I even going to,
[9514.30 → 9515.92] how am I even going to applicable anything?
[9516.10 → 9518.58] Like I just sit in a chair and pretend you're on a plane.
[9518.98 → 9519.34] I'm obviously,
[9519.48 → 9519.56] yeah,
[9519.62 → 9519.82] I mean,
[9519.90 → 9520.26] yeah,
[9520.26 → 9520.60] okay,
[9520.60 → 9521.16] obviously,
[9521.36 → 9522.40] but you can do it.
[9522.46 → 9522.76] Yeah.
[9522.76 → 9524.20] I know I can,
[9524.20 → 9525.14] I know I can,
[9525.14 → 9526.98] I know I can sit in a chair.
[9527.36 → 9527.86] Good boy.
[9531.06 → 9532.02] Do you want a Welch's?
[9534.88 → 9535.88] You got a great one.
[9535.88 → 9537.56] All right.
[9538.36 → 9538.72] No,
[9538.80 → 9539.10] but like,
[9539.12 → 9539.26] yeah,
[9539.30 → 9539.76] I think,
[9539.86 → 9540.72] I think it's the
[9540.72 → 9544.26] the price tag is a big holdback for the vast majority of people,
[9544.26 → 9544.44] right?
[9544.44 → 9545.50] It's going to be a huge issue.
[9545.64 → 9548.08] We were just talking about the price of GPUs earlier,
[9548.52 → 9549.60] a VR headset for $3,500.
[9550.10 → 9550.42] I mean,
[9550.44 → 9550.70] we were,
[9550.70 → 9553.34] we were balking at VR headsets that were less than a thousand,
[9553.46 → 9554.24] not that many years ago.
[9554.34 → 9555.44] Now it's 3,500 bucks.
[9555.62 → 9555.74] Yeah,
[9555.74 → 9556.58] it's obviously crazy.
[9556.88 → 9559.28] I think there's going to be a market of people that are interested in it.
[9559.42 → 9560.86] I literally know people that have already bought it.
[9563.50 → 9563.90] Yeah.
[9563.90 → 9565.82] Oh no,
[9565.86 → 9565.96] no,
[9565.96 → 9566.26] not me.
[9566.68 → 9568.08] I thought you were saying you do too.
[9568.16 → 9569.58] And then I realized that you were saying,
[9569.66 → 9570.32] I don't know anybody,
[9570.60 → 9572.16] but I know other people as well.
[9572.24 → 9572.36] Yeah.
[9572.58 → 9573.02] Um,
[9573.88 → 9575.20] multiple actually.
[9575.70 → 9576.10] Um,
[9576.54 → 9581.64] and pretty much all of them are unanimously saying monitor replacement,
[9581.82 → 9582.94] not at my desk.
[9583.18 → 9587.98] So they're not trying to replace their currently existing multi-monitor setup,
[9587.98 → 9591.50] but they are trying to make it so that.
[9591.50 → 9593.04] that's a really,
[9593.04 → 9595.34] that's a really extravagant.
[9595.84 → 9598.90] I'm writing my novel in the Starbucks and I want to do it like,
[9598.98 → 9600.00] like next gen.
[9600.20 → 9600.48] Yep.
[9601.20 → 9601.64] Accessory.
[9602.30 → 9602.70] Absolutely.
[9603.22 → 9605.62] It's going to have to get a lot more useful than that.
[9606.20 → 9606.60] Yeah.
[9606.68 → 9607.70] For the vast majority of people.
[9607.78 → 9607.88] Yeah.
[9607.94 → 9608.84] So they had,
[9608.84 → 9612.58] they had 200,000 pre-orders, and they're going to sell a bunch more.
[9612.64 → 9613.24] I guarantee it.
[9614.70 → 9615.88] Apple's a hell of a thing.
[9615.88 → 9617.88] Honestly,
[9618.88 → 9619.52] straight up.
[9619.56 → 9623.88] If meta released the exact same headset at the exact same quality,
[9624.88 → 9626.48] people would tell them they were idiots.
[9626.48 → 9626.88] Yeah,
[9627.16 → 9627.80] but then may,
[9627.90 → 9629.04] maybe their stock would go.
[9629.68 → 9630.16] Maybe.
[9630.42 → 9630.82] Bankers.
[9630.82 → 9633.06] Like it did today or yesterday or something like that.
[9633.12 → 9633.30] It went.
[9633.54 → 9633.74] Really?
[9634.42 → 9635.60] I think developers.
[9635.80 → 9635.90] Yeah.
[9635.90 → 9637.56] And that is going like wild.
[9637.70 → 9637.88] Like,
[9638.42 → 9638.58] well,
[9638.88 → 9639.72] if it was windows space,
[9639.72 → 9642.26] I think developers would hop on that within an hour.
[9642.48 → 9643.36] What happened?
[9643.54 → 9644.10] I forget.
[9644.22 → 9645.40] This is the five day.
[9645.48 → 9646.56] This is the five day.
[9646.70 → 9647.20] It's their,
[9647.28 → 9649.28] it's their year of efficiency or whatever.
[9649.40 → 9649.76] I don't know.
[9649.86 → 9650.16] Who knows?
[9650.84 → 9651.58] It's the stock market.
[9651.58 → 9651.84] 20%?
[9652.24 → 9652.56] Biden.
[9653.04 → 9653.44] Bidenomics.
[9658.88 → 9659.80] Oh man.
[9660.28 → 9660.68] Okay.
[9660.96 → 9661.12] Cool.
[9661.42 → 9661.72] Earnings.
[9661.76 → 9662.76] Apparently they declared a
[9662.84 → 9663.00] oh,
[9663.04 → 9664.42] they declared a dividend on the stock.
[9664.42 → 9668.18] So owning it means you like get money instead of just,
[9668.30 → 9669.34] you only get money when you sell.
[9670.20 → 9670.58] Okay.
[9670.72 → 9671.04] All right.
[9671.10 → 9671.94] That makes sense.
[9672.84 → 9673.20] Okay.
[9675.52 → 9675.92] Cool.
[9676.94 → 9677.30] Um,
[9681.30 → 9683.08] but what else have we got here?
[9683.20 → 9685.14] Do you want to talk about the AI poisoning tool?
[9686.08 → 9686.32] Yeah.
[9686.36 → 9689.86] I thought this was something different until I read it in the doc, and now I'm like way more interested.
[9690.04 → 9691.14] I didn't bother reading into this.
[9691.38 → 9693.02] I'm going to run to the washroom while you go through it.
[9693.02 → 9693.70] Because I've already read it.
[9693.70 → 9693.96] Sure.
[9694.36 → 9694.66] Uh,
[9694.66 → 9698.94] I didn't bother read into this earlier in the week because I assumed it was like,
[9698.94 → 9699.88] is it on that one?
[9699.94 → 9700.06] Yeah.
[9700.16 → 9701.90] I assumed that it was,
[9701.90 → 9702.62] um,
[9702.94 → 9703.50] just like,
[9703.54 → 9703.82] you know,
[9703.86 → 9708.46] a way to jailbreak AIs that we've had forever and people just bought it for whatever reason,
[9708.48 → 9709.12] but that's not it.
[9709.38 → 9710.08] That's not it at all.
[9710.14 → 9711.34] It is way cooler than that.
[9711.34 → 9718.74] A team at the University of Chicago released their new free AI poisoning tool called Nightshade.
[9718.86 → 9723.92] It was downloaded at least 250,000 times in the first five days.
[9724.24 → 9725.76] Nightshade is intended to disrupt,
[9725.76 → 9726.62] uh,
[9726.62 → 9733.72] art generation models that scrape art without permission by identifying the subject of the image,
[9733.72 → 9738.70] then applying a tag that subtly alters the image at the pixel level.
[9739.58 → 9744.56] So other AI programs see something totally different from what's actually there.
[9745.66 → 9746.22] Interesting.
[9746.22 → 9747.40] Gradually,
[9747.40 → 9754.22] this will poison the AI's training data by making it misclassify the original images and
[9754.22 → 9756.50] therefore generate confused,
[9756.88 → 9757.62] muddled,
[9758.06 → 9759.84] hallucinated images.
[9760.22 → 9766.70] The changes Nightshade makes are reportedly more robust than watermarks as the effect remains
[9766.70 → 9768.70] even when the image is screenshotted,
[9769.16 → 9769.84] cropped,
[9770.36 → 9770.72] uh,
[9770.92 → 9771.48] compressed,
[9771.60 → 9772.84] or even filtered.
[9772.84 → 9773.40] The
[9773.40 → 9779.74] the same team has previously released a separate program called Glaze intended to confuse AI training
[9779.74 → 9780.34] algorithms.
[9780.34 → 9785.14] So they interpret the image as having a completely different style than it actually does.
[9785.50 → 9790.02] They recommend using both together for the best effect.
[9790.64 → 9792.04] There's a discussion question,
[9792.14 → 9793.50] which I guess is Dan and I now,
[9793.60 → 9799.38] can we expect the notion of copyright to change in the AI era and how,
[9799.66 → 9799.96] uh,
[9799.96 → 9800.26] because,
[9800.36 → 9800.54] you know,
[9800.54 → 9805.86] everything is eventually made using tools that involve some kind of AI trained on some other type of copyrighted material,
[9806.04 → 9806.26] et cetera,
[9806.32 → 9806.52] et cetera,
[9806.56 → 9806.80] et cetera.
[9808.16 → 9808.56] Um,
[9808.66 → 9809.82] yeah,
[9809.90 → 9810.48] I don't know.
[9810.72 → 9812.56] All I know is I think this is super cool.
[9813.04 → 9813.44] Um,
[9814.76 → 9816.10] I,
[9816.10 → 9816.54] I,
[9816.54 → 9817.46] I find the
[9817.46 → 9820.50] the tool war of AI to be an fascinating thing.
[9820.62 → 9824.34] I wish I had read into this more so before the show,
[9824.34 → 9826.68] because I think it's fascinating and I will do so.
[9826.84 → 9827.00] I will,
[9827.06 → 9828.88] I will dive further into it after the show.
[9828.88 → 9830.46] There is a really cool,
[9830.46 → 9831.34] um,
[9832.12 → 9832.58] page,
[9832.82 → 9840.66] just nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu slash what is.html.
[9840.76 → 9841.58] I might as well do the whole thing.
[9841.86 → 9842.90] And they have a whole write-up,
[9843.04 → 9843.70] um,
[9843.76 → 9844.46] talking about it.
[9844.50 → 9845.96] You should check that out if you are interested.
[9846.76 → 9847.42] Super cool.
[9847.58 → 9848.50] I love this kind of stuff.
[9849.04 → 9849.40] Fantastic.
[9850.66 → 9851.60] I like that if you don't,
[9851.60 → 9853.92] if you don't want your stuff shared,
[9853.92 → 9857.40] you have some tools in order to,
[9857.46 → 9857.78] uh,
[9858.40 → 9858.76] you know,
[9858.80 → 9859.64] make it worse,
[9859.74 → 9860.24] which is great.
[9861.46 → 9861.98] Very good.
[9862.66 → 9863.54] Is that Miss Vicky's?
[9864.04 → 9864.28] Yeah.
[9864.38 → 9865.34] We have Miss Vicky's now?
[9866.04 → 9866.34] Yeah,
[9866.38 → 9867.40] I've had Miss Vicky's for ages.
[9867.52 → 9868.78] I don't usually look at the snacks.
[9868.96 → 9869.48] That's cool though.
[9869.60 → 9870.42] Miss Vicky's are great chips.
[9870.50 → 9870.66] Yeah,
[9870.82 → 9871.28] they're good chips.
[9871.36 → 9872.68] This is not an ad for Miss Vicky's.
[9872.82 → 9873.04] Nope,
[9873.08 → 9873.66] not even a little.
[9873.86 → 9874.06] Nope.
[9874.80 → 9875.16] Um,
[9875.60 → 9876.22] they'll kill you.
[9876.82 → 9877.08] Yeah.
[9878.04 → 9878.80] So if it was an ad,
[9878.84 → 9879.66] they wouldn't let me say that.
[9879.84 → 9880.06] Yeah.
[9880.06 → 9880.66] Yeah.
[9880.66 → 9881.22] Yeah.
[9881.36 → 9887.52] It's amazing how many people think like we have secret sponsorships and stuff that are not disclosed.
[9887.76 → 9888.66] When we will,
[9888.78 → 9890.74] when we will say stuff that's just like,
[9891.14 → 9893.54] clearly you don't know anything about working with sponsors.
[9893.54 → 9893.94] There's,
[9894.10 → 9901.96] there's absolutely no way any brand would have you say anything like that in a video that they sponsored.
[9904.10 → 9904.94] Oh boy.
[9905.34 → 9905.90] Um,
[9907.12 → 9907.68] some,
[9907.86 → 9908.16] uh,
[9908.16 → 9910.38] actually somewhat interesting AI news this week.
[9910.76 → 9911.14] Google,
[9911.50 → 9911.74] uh,
[9911.74 → 9916.28] the barred chatbot can now use Google's own image in two model to generate images.
[9916.44 → 9916.82] Congratulations.
[9916.82 → 9918.00] You're slowly,
[9918.22 → 9918.78] uh,
[9919.06 → 9921.12] feature matching other things.
[9921.44 → 9921.86] Uh,
[9921.94 → 9924.52] generative AI chat is being added to Google maps.
[9924.92 → 9925.32] Uh,
[9925.40 → 9925.94] awesome.
[9926.76 → 9927.68] That's great.
[9928.36 → 9930.50] Now it's probably going to direct me to the wrong place.
[9930.50 → 9932.44] Some percentage of the time because of hallucinations.
[9932.44 → 9933.72] I don't want that at all.
[9933.96 → 9934.20] Uh,
[9934.20 → 9936.40] Amazon announced Rufus,
[9936.74 → 9937.36] a chatbot.
[9937.36 → 9937.62] Oh,
[9937.86 → 9939.06] rip Rufus USB,
[9939.48 → 9939.74] uh,
[9939.74 → 9940.54] announced Rufus,
[9940.62 → 9944.04] a chatbot in beta that will help customers shop on the platform.
[9944.32 → 9946.02] Maybe you'll be able to find TVs more easily.
[9946.30 → 9946.70] Um,
[9946.74 → 9947.36] and Apple,
[9947.48 → 9948.36] according to Tim Cook,
[9948.46 → 9954.36] Apple is putting a tremendous amount of time and effort into AI and plans to share more details later this year.
[9954.60 → 9955.38] That's a
[9955.66 → 9955.96] okay.
[9956.20 → 9956.54] Uh,
[9956.54 → 9962.16] perhaps something related to their published paper about getting LLMs running locally on iPhones.
[9962.16 → 9963.82] That would actually be cool.
[9964.08 → 9965.74] That would actually be sweet.
[9966.64 → 9970.92] That would make buying an iPhone significantly more intriguing.
[9971.30 → 9973.52] Apple's been putting neural processing into their,
[9973.72 → 9975.28] into their Apple Silicon,
[9975.28 → 9977.20] or do they call iPhone Silicon,
[9977.30 → 9977.78] Apple Silicon?
[9977.94 → 9978.44] I can't remember.
[9978.54 → 9978.86] But anyway,
[9978.96 → 9981.06] into there A series chips for quite some time now.
[9981.88 → 9984.32] So I see no reason why they couldn't do this.
[9984.32 → 9988.74] Having a local LLM on there would be fantastic because local things would be useful.
[9989.30 → 9989.40] Yeah,
[9989.46 → 9989.66] maybe.
[9989.94 → 9990.10] Yeah,
[9990.10 → 9990.30] that's true.
[9990.40 → 9990.84] That may be nice.
[9992.28 → 9992.58] Um,
[9992.58 → 9994.20] they could have done that without it being local though.
[9994.20 → 9996.04] And then it would be annoying and suck.
[9996.88 → 9998.76] Universal Music Group pulls tick,
[9998.90 → 10000.06] pulls music off of TikTok.
[10000.50 → 10000.96] Um,
[10000.96 → 10001.70] and then Spec Ops,
[10001.76 → 10003.06] the line was pulled off steam.
[10003.22 → 10004.22] That's actually the second one.
[10004.26 → 10005.32] That's a little more interesting to me,
[10005.38 → 10007.92] but a bunch of TikToks got muted because,
[10007.92 → 10008.54] uh,
[10008.54 → 10012.34] licensing negotiations broke down between BMG and TikTok this week.
[10014.04 → 10015.82] Imagine TikTok caring about that.
[10015.94 → 10016.12] I,
[10016.16 → 10016.62] I,
[10016.62 → 10016.86] I,
[10016.94 → 10017.92] I must've missed.
[10018.08 → 10019.88] I blinked and TikTok went from just,
[10019.94 → 10020.02] yeah,
[10020.02 → 10020.98] we just use whatever music,
[10021.08 → 10021.26] whatever.
[10021.36 → 10021.84] We don't care.
[10021.90 → 10023.62] We're from China, and we don't care at all.
[10023.62 → 10024.10] To,
[10025.14 → 10027.14] now they mute licensed music.
[10027.60 → 10028.00] Um,
[10028.08 → 10028.46] interesting.
[10029.38 → 10029.88] Anyway,
[10030.70 → 10033.36] the critically acclaimed 2012 game Spec Ops,
[10033.44 → 10037.00] the line was suddenly delisted from digital storefronts earlier this week.
[10037.06 → 10038.98] In response to a question from the verge,
[10039.18 → 10043.68] 2K stated that the removal was due to the expiration of multiple partnership licenses,
[10043.68 → 10048.32] which the verge took as a reference to copyrighted music on the game's soundtrack.
[10048.94 → 10050.74] So it's been 10 years,
[10051.26 → 10051.46] uh,
[10051.46 → 10051.80] 12,
[10051.90 → 10053.16] that's a weird expiry.
[10053.16 → 10053.94] It is a weird one.
[10054.06 → 10054.30] Anyway,
[10054.38 → 10055.12] the game's director,
[10055.20 → 10057.96] Corey Davis called the removal devastating personally,
[10057.96 → 10060.54] both for him and the rest of the creative team.
[10060.60 → 10063.72] And he likewise stated that this is not the end for Spec Ops,
[10063.78 → 10064.16] the line,
[10064.28 → 10067.14] but what future the game might have is currently unclear.
[10067.54 → 10071.18] These kinds of licensing issues have come up before.
[10071.28 → 10075.22] Wasn't there a GTA game that had a bunch of licensed music in it that had to be changed at some point?
[10075.36 → 10075.78] Not sure.
[10075.78 → 10076.74] I'm not sure if I,
[10076.84 → 10077.64] I'm not sure if I,
[10077.76 → 10080.06] I'm going to be able to remember exactly what it was,
[10080.10 → 10082.36] but I know we've definitely seen stuff like that before.
[10082.62 → 10082.96] That's cool.
[10083.04 → 10083.44] Bell rock.
[10083.56 → 10083.84] Uh,
[10083.84 → 10084.40] GTA four,
[10084.48 → 10084.74] apparently.
[10085.12 → 10085.52] Yeah.
[10086.52 → 10087.02] Vice city.
[10087.10 → 10087.22] Oh,
[10087.22 → 10087.62] okay.
[10087.66 → 10089.86] Apparently there is GTA four vice city.
[10090.00 → 10090.56] Fun fact.
[10090.70 → 10094.88] I haven't actually played through a GTA game at all.
[10096.92 → 10100.04] I played a bunch of ones that came out for Android.
[10100.20 → 10101.20] I forget which one it was.
[10101.24 → 10101.72] It was three,
[10101.84 → 10102.08] maybe,
[10102.18 → 10102.78] uh,
[10102.78 → 10104.02] on my Nvidia shield,
[10104.14 → 10105.80] but I didn't beat it.
[10106.66 → 10108.60] I think I beat five.
[10108.74 → 10109.42] Cancel them boys.
[10109.50 → 10109.62] Yeah,
[10109.66 → 10109.82] I know,
[10109.88 → 10112.48] but that would have happened like almost 10 years ago.
[10113.04 → 10114.24] So I don't know.
[10114.36 → 10115.94] It's been too long to really remember.
[10116.42 → 10116.72] Uh,
[10116.72 → 10118.36] I didn't beat anyone's other than five.
[10118.44 → 10118.98] I don't think,
[10119.28 → 10122.06] but I haven't played any GTA game in a hot minute.
[10122.10 → 10122.72] So I'm not sure.
[10124.34 → 10124.78] Mafia.
[10124.86 → 10126.72] I actually liked the mafia games more.
[10126.84 → 10127.06] Yeah.
[10127.06 → 10128.04] That's on my list of,
[10128.14 → 10129.90] I need to get around to this at some point.
[10130.00 → 10133.28] Cause mafia two remastered came out a little while ago and apparently just
[10133.28 → 10134.30] flipping awesome.
[10134.50 → 10136.18] So I liked mafia too.
[10137.34 → 10137.78] Um,
[10137.88 → 10140.84] finally edge got caught stealing Chrome tabs.
[10141.06 → 10141.18] Yeah.
[10141.18 → 10141.68] What is this?
[10141.68 → 10145.40] An edge feature that allows it to import data from other browsers has gotten
[10145.40 → 10146.28] more aggressive,
[10146.56 → 10148.46] much to the surprise of several users,
[10148.60 → 10151.60] including Tom Warren from the verge who found that after the most recent
[10151.60 → 10155.74] Windows update edge opened automatically with all the tabs from their
[10155.74 → 10156.36] default browser.
[10156.46 → 10156.74] Chrome.
[10157.20 → 10160.42] One user had even uninstalled edge and deleted all of its app data only to
[10160.42 → 10163.08] have it open with all his Chrome tabs imported after an update.
[10164.26 → 10165.50] So that's bad.
[10165.92 → 10166.32] Uh,
[10166.36 → 10167.54] time for a one show after dark.
[10168.04 → 10168.44] Yeah.
[10168.80 → 10171.60] Have you noticed teams is just like ignoring default,
[10171.60 → 10172.34] browser stuff?
[10172.58 → 10172.88] Yes,
[10172.88 → 10173.24] I have.
[10173.24 → 10173.48] Um,
[10173.58 → 10173.66] I,
[10173.72 → 10174.78] that's over the last couple of weeks,
[10174.78 → 10175.10] I guess.
[10175.10 → 10175.32] Right.
[10175.32 → 10176.00] I think it,
[10176.00 → 10180.58] I think it might've gained a setting where you can now set teams as default
[10180.58 → 10182.08] browser to something that is an edge,
[10182.08 → 10183.92] but when it first happened,
[10183.92 → 10185.46] I don't think that was possible,
[10185.58 → 10186.58] which was awesome.
[10187.86 → 10188.26] Awesome.
[10189.10 → 10190.28] And then people were having,
[10190.38 → 10191.02] we're,
[10191.06 → 10191.30] we're,
[10191.30 → 10191.98] we're slowly,
[10191.98 → 10194.64] there's going to be notes in the Monday morning meeting about this,
[10194.64 → 10195.06] uh,
[10195.06 → 10196.28] for people that work at the company,
[10196.28 → 10200.78] but we're slowly working on a migration, and it will be announced as a full
[10200.78 → 10204.28] migration on Monday to everyone in the company using teams for meetings
[10204.28 → 10206.28] instead of Google meet through calendar.
[10207.08 → 10208.26] And in doing that,
[10208.26 → 10211.46] we've been finding a lot of problems with teams meetings.
[10211.46 → 10215.46] Ah,
[10216.06 → 10219.94] teams has also been especially having trouble the last week or so.
[10220.04 → 10220.48] I think it is.
[10220.62 → 10221.44] Maybe that's it.
[10221.48 → 10222.42] And maybe it'll get better.
[10222.48 → 10222.94] Let's hope.
[10223.06 → 10223.38] Okay.
[10223.48 → 10224.48] I wouldn't count on that.
[10224.66 → 10225.06] Yeah.
[10226.32 → 10226.72] Yeah.
[10229.60 → 10230.00] Yeah.
[10230.54 → 10230.98] Anyway,
[10231.08 → 10231.58] after dark.
[10233.26 → 10233.68] Sure.
[10233.84 → 10234.42] Let's see what we got.
[10234.88 → 10235.08] Hi,
[10235.18 → 10235.66] LLD.
[10236.34 → 10239.58] You've spoken of the difficulties running video hosting services.
[10239.58 → 10242.38] Think there's wisdom to be gleaned from the older sites.
[10242.58 → 10242.96] For example,
[10243.14 → 10247.02] new grounds on track to 30 years of hosting user content.
[10247.26 → 10247.40] Actually,
[10247.40 → 10250.90] we were having a fun conversation right before the show started about,
[10250.90 → 10251.30] uh,
[10251.30 → 10252.34] Twitch and the no good,
[10252.44 → 10254.66] very bad week that they've had.
[10254.78 → 10255.06] Um,
[10255.12 → 10257.80] Pokémon announced that she's no longer exclusive.
[10257.80 → 10259.58] She will stream wherever she pleases.
[10260.12 → 10260.48] Um,
[10260.62 → 10261.20] and you know,
[10261.22 → 10262.14] obviously Pokémon,
[10262.22 → 10264.54] Pokémon's not the biggest creator on the platform,
[10264.54 → 10266.56] but she's certainly a prominent one.
[10266.70 → 10269.56] And she's just one of many prominent creators.
[10269.58 → 10271.18] creators who have left or,
[10271.18 → 10272.54] uh,
[10272.58 → 10272.78] or,
[10272.78 → 10276.34] or multi-stream now to platform such as YouTube and kick.
[10276.80 → 10277.32] And,
[10277.42 → 10277.96] um,
[10279.46 → 10279.70] you know,
[10279.72 → 10280.90] part of the conversation around,
[10281.00 → 10281.12] you know,
[10281.14 → 10281.26] how,
[10281.34 → 10285.60] how could they let Pokémon go or whatever is probably going to end up
[10285.60 → 10286.96] coming around to money.
[10287.40 → 10287.92] And,
[10287.92 → 10288.62] uh,
[10288.70 → 10292.24] Luke came across a calculator that I think you guys might find very
[10292.24 → 10292.88] interesting.
[10292.98 → 10294.36] Can I switch over to your screen?
[10294.76 → 10294.92] Yeah.
[10294.92 → 10295.04] Yeah.
[10295.28 → 10298.98] So the calculation that I have on screen is roughly for this show on
[10298.98 → 10299.80] public channels.
[10299.80 → 10303.86] So I think there was like 2000 and something on Twitch.
[10304.02 → 10307.80] There was like almost 13,000 or something on YouTube.
[10307.80 → 10311.22] And then I threw in 20 for good measure because Facebook exists.
[10311.62 → 10312.06] Um,
[10312.06 → 10314.50] and I did the standard plan.
[10314.66 → 10315.08] Because I don't know,
[10315.12 → 10315.36] whatever,
[10315.48 → 10317.42] there isn't a big difference between standard and basics.
[10317.42 → 10320.50] So I did standard and then 10 AP cause that's what we're streaming in.
[10320.58 → 10322.52] I'm saying the WAN show is roughly four hours.
[10322.66 → 10323.74] We have that many viewers.
[10324.22 → 10324.48] Uh,
[10324.48 → 10325.74] and this is average viewers.
[10325.74 → 10328.72] So I did a hundred percent of the stream because I don't have the total amount
[10328.72 → 10330.72] of viewers in order to give a lower percentage.
[10330.72 → 10332.82] So we did a hundred percent of the stream and,
[10332.82 → 10333.12] uh,
[10333.20 → 10333.60] yeah,
[10334.42 → 10335.88] 8,000 us dollars.
[10335.88 → 10339.52] Now this isn't some number that Luke pulled out of his butt.
[10339.80 → 10340.12] No,
[10340.20 → 10342.38] this is from Amazon's actual cost estimator.
[10342.50 → 10344.04] This is Amazon IVs cost estimator.
[10344.16 → 10347.56] This is the thing that kick uses and Twitch uses and Twitch.
[10347.78 → 10348.06] Yeah.
[10348.14 → 10348.60] Effectively.
[10348.84 → 10349.04] Yeah.
[10349.72 → 10351.26] This is someone mentioned pirate software.
[10351.38 → 10351.50] Yeah.
[10351.54 → 10352.56] I'd seen this before,
[10352.56 → 10354.04] but I saw his thing on this.
[10354.04 → 10354.44] Uh,
[10354.44 → 10355.84] and that reminded me of this site,
[10355.92 → 10356.80] which is why I showed Linus.
[10356.92 → 10358.02] He's pirate software is really cool,
[10358.20 → 10358.32] but,
[10358.84 → 10359.30] um,
[10360.18 → 10360.42] yeah.
[10360.44 → 10362.62] Then I looked over here and was like,
[10362.66 → 10365.12] how many people are alive right now on these different websites?
[10365.12 → 10366.50] So let's go,
[10366.64 → 10366.94] uh,
[10366.94 → 10369.52] 3,262 channels.
[10369.72 → 10369.90] Yeah.
[10369.92 → 10370.10] Let's,
[10370.22 → 10371.28] let's play a game.
[10371.32 → 10371.56] Let's,
[10371.64 → 10372.60] let's play a game.
[10372.86 → 10374.46] 3,262 channels.
[10374.58 → 10374.72] Oh,
[10374.74 → 10375.54] that's a big number.
[10375.88 → 10376.36] Um,
[10376.36 → 10378.68] and let's go viewers right now.
[10378.86 → 10379.38] Ooh,
[10379.76 → 10380.44] what's there like?
[10380.60 → 10381.32] Lets kind of,
[10381.32 → 10381.88] lets kind of,
[10381.88 → 10383.12] let's kind of eyeball this.
[10383.16 → 10384.12] Let's eyeball this.
[10384.20 → 10384.42] Grab,
[10384.56 → 10385.80] grab halfway up a slope.
[10385.92 → 10388.44] They look like halfway up a slope is around here,
[10388.46 → 10388.80] actually.
[10389.38 → 10389.72] Okay.
[10390.36 → 10390.88] Uh,
[10390.88 → 10391.76] maybe even higher.
[10391.96 → 10392.28] This is,
[10392.50 → 10395.00] this is fairly low as far as I can tell for average.
[10395.00 → 10395.74] Let's say a hundred,
[10395.86 → 10397.20] let's say 180,000.
[10397.48 → 10397.78] Sure.
[10398.36 → 10399.18] And then,
[10399.68 → 10402.56] okay.
[10402.60 → 10403.36] And then let's,
[10403.46 → 10403.90] um,
[10404.68 → 10405.34] that's all.
[10405.46 → 10405.58] Yeah.
[10405.58 → 10406.48] That's all the time,
[10406.52 → 10407.92] but that's not four hours.
[10407.92 → 10408.66] That's all day.
[10410.60 → 10411.04] Ah,
[10411.04 → 10411.34] yes.
[10412.98 → 10413.42] Now,
[10413.88 → 10416.40] obviously they would have volume discounts,
[10416.62 → 10418.42] probably very significant ones.
[10418.42 → 10421.30] Obviously this is marked up.
[10421.44 → 10424.04] This is not Amazon's raw cost to,
[10424.12 → 10424.90] to run Twitch.
[10424.96 → 10425.20] Oh,
[10425.30 → 10426.12] and Twitch is,
[10426.24 → 10426.58] has,
[10426.76 → 10427.10] I mean,
[10427.16 → 10428.50] it's way higher numbers.
[10428.90 → 10431.44] Let's have a look at what Twitch's numbers look like.
[10431.62 → 10431.90] Two,
[10432.12 → 10433.32] two point,
[10433.32 → 10436.62] two million viewers and 140,000 channels.
[10436.74 → 10437.80] Do we even want to input this?
[10437.94 → 10439.82] This number obviously means nothing.
[10439.82 → 10440.84] Just to be very clear.
[10440.92 → 10441.84] It's just fun.
[10442.34 → 10442.64] Uh,
[10442.64 → 10443.06] don't take,
[10443.06 → 10445.96] don't take this too seriously.
[10446.60 → 10447.12] Um,
[10447.32 → 10448.22] but it's,
[10448.24 → 10450.66] it's entertaining to throw it in the calculator anyway.
[10451.08 → 10451.50] Um,
[10451.64 → 10451.94] woo.
[10454.94 → 10456.14] For a day.
[10456.42 → 10456.88] Um,
[10457.54 → 10460.46] obviously this is not representative for like a billion different reasons.
[10460.46 → 10461.06] So again,
[10461.18 → 10464.44] don't run for 727 billion different reasons.
[10466.00 → 10467.80] But obviously doesn't cost that much.
[10467.80 → 10473.04] But the point is that it doesn't make sense to give gigantic pay.
[10473.06 → 10475.42] layouts to streamers to stream on your platform.
[10476.02 → 10476.94] When streaming is expensive.
[10476.94 → 10481.38] When those are the only ones that you're making money on anyway.
[10482.00 → 10482.52] Um,
[10482.66 → 10484.02] and you are,
[10484.16 → 10487.68] you've basically been operating at a loss from the moment you acquired this
[10487.68 → 10492.58] company until now with absolutely no end in sight for it operating at a
[10492.58 → 10492.94] loss.
[10493.12 → 10493.70] Uh,
[10493.70 → 10499.16] the only reason kick exists at all is that it's just gambling money.
[10500.12 → 10500.72] Yeah.
[10500.72 → 10501.32] Yeah.
[10502.58 → 10503.02] So.
[10503.30 → 10503.70] Yeah.
[10503.72 → 10504.62] And then you throw like,
[10504.62 → 10505.32] uh,
[10506.04 → 10509.28] Amazon Prime free subscriptions into the pile as well.
[10509.92 → 10510.32] Like,
[10510.48 → 10512.08] so a lot of people have asked us,
[10512.16 → 10512.26] Hey,
[10512.32 → 10512.74] float plane,
[10512.82 → 10514.04] why are you guys like slacking?
[10514.16 → 10518.52] Why don't you like to have a free tier, and why don't you do more on streaming and
[10518.52 → 10519.20] do this and do that?
[10519.24 → 10519.44] Cause,
[10519.58 → 10520.36] because we don't,
[10520.36 → 10522.84] because we don't like putting money in a fire.
[10522.84 → 10524.30] Yeah.
[10524.30 → 10525.08] Streaming and streaming.
[10525.22 → 10525.34] We,
[10525.42 → 10526.92] we offer streaming on flow plane,
[10527.00 → 10527.50] but it's like,
[10527.50 → 10529.44] it's,
[10529.48 → 10532.96] it's an Avenue that I honestly wish we never went down.
[10533.04 → 10533.46] Uh,
[10533.46 → 10534.64] we can't take it back now,
[10534.64 → 10536.70] but I wish we can.
[10536.94 → 10537.24] Yeah,
[10537.36 → 10537.98] but we shouldn't,
[10538.06 → 10538.78] we shouldn't.
[10538.78 → 10539.34] Um,
[10539.52 → 10541.56] and yeah,
[10541.56 → 10541.86] it's,
[10541.94 → 10542.52] it's rough.
[10542.58 → 10542.80] What,
[10542.88 → 10545.76] what I like in my head kind of wish we did was,
[10545.88 → 10551.80] was just develop a live chat that detects if a Twitch or YouTube or whatever else stream
[10551.80 → 10556.74] is live and then generates a subscriber only live chat for you or something like that.
[10556.74 → 10557.62] I don't know.
[10557.74 → 10557.98] Um,
[10557.98 → 10559.44] but I mean,
[10559.56 → 10560.22] we did it.
[10560.44 → 10561.20] It's here now.
[10561.46 → 10562.02] So we,
[10562.14 → 10563.78] we do the streamings.
[10564.04 → 10564.42] Um,
[10564.68 → 10565.62] and it's just,
[10565.68 → 10566.28] it's a fun,
[10566.36 → 10567.82] it's a fun calculator to,
[10567.82 → 10568.52] to,
[10568.70 → 10570.22] to play with,
[10570.28 → 10570.66] I guess.
[10570.72 → 10570.92] Yeah.
[10571.06 → 10571.42] Uh,
[10571.42 → 10571.62] it's,
[10571.68 → 10572.46] it's rough too,
[10572.46 → 10575.72] because something that was actually very surprising to me using the steaming,
[10575.82 → 10576.08] uh,
[10576.08 → 10577.26] streams charts site.
[10577.34 → 10578.58] I don't know how accurate it is.
[10578.64 → 10579.38] I just found it,
[10579.38 → 10580.14] uh,
[10580.14 → 10580.44] today,
[10580.44 → 10582.48] but stream charts,
[10583.36 → 10584.42] Twitch's was really high,
[10584.48 → 10584.68] right?
[10584.92 → 10586.08] 140,000 channels,
[10586.22 → 10586.72] 2.3 million.
[10586.74 → 10588.76] This was surprising to me.
[10590.38 → 10590.82] Yeah.
[10590.90 → 10591.78] YouTube is low-key.
[10591.78 → 10592.46] Kind of big deal.
[10592.62 → 10592.84] Whoa.
[10592.86 → 10593.42] It turns out.
[10594.04 → 10596.18] I didn't think for live-streaming though.
[10596.50 → 10599.40] I didn't think they'd have like twice the viewers.
[10599.54 → 10599.74] Dude,
[10599.78 → 10600.30] it's YouTube.
[10601.12 → 10601.60] Wow.
[10601.72 → 10602.56] Everyone who's like,
[10602.66 → 10602.84] yeah,
[10602.88 → 10603.12] man,
[10603.20 → 10603.46] like,
[10603.80 → 10604.22] you know,
[10604.30 → 10605.84] rumbles,
[10606.10 → 10606.68] you know,
[10606.74 → 10607.18] YouTube,
[10607.34 → 10608.96] YouTube sucks.
[10609.10 → 10609.34] It's good.
[10609.42 → 10609.72] We're good.
[10610.76 → 10615.84] YouTube is just unfathomably powerful.
[10616.56 → 10617.30] They peaked.
[10617.50 → 10617.80] What is,
[10617.86 → 10618.58] is this yesterday?
[10619.74 → 10620.66] Seven days ago.
[10620.88 → 10622.62] They peaked at 8 million viewers.
[10622.72 → 10622.82] Yeah.
[10622.86 → 10623.14] They don't,
[10623.22 → 10623.44] they don't,
[10623.64 → 10624.76] they don't need to,
[10625.02 → 10629.58] they don't need to offer giant packages to prominent streamers.
[10629.66 → 10630.38] They don't need to.
[10630.48 → 10630.76] I mean,
[10630.80 → 10631.16] they can,
[10631.20 → 10632.10] if they feel like it,
[10632.10 → 10634.90] but they also just don't need to.
[10635.64 → 10636.04] Yeah.
[10636.04 → 10636.68] That's wild.
[10636.84 → 10639.50] Cause like I was looking at our numbers, and we had,
[10639.58 → 10639.66] yeah,
[10639.72 → 10642.80] 13,000 live on YouTube and then 2,900 on,
[10642.80 → 10643.42] on Twitch.
[10644.00 → 10644.44] Um,
[10644.58 → 10646.30] I don't know why anyone's watching on Twitch.
[10646.38 → 10646.72] Uh,
[10646.82 → 10649.00] Colton insisted on turning the ads back on.
[10649.08 → 10650.20] So that's why they're back on.
[10650.36 → 10650.66] Nice.
[10650.74 → 10654.48] So you should be just good watch on float plane or watch on YouTube or watch on
[10654.48 → 10655.24] Facebook apparently.
[10655.24 → 10656.02] Cause that's a thing.
[10656.52 → 10656.92] Yeah.
[10658.24 → 10658.64] Yeah.
[10658.64 → 10659.00] I don't know.
[10659.04 → 10659.36] It's just,
[10659.44 → 10660.02] it's an interesting,
[10660.14 → 10660.48] it was a
[10660.48 → 10661.60] it was a fun dive.
[10661.66 → 10662.10] Uh,
[10662.10 → 10662.90] cause yeah,
[10663.54 → 10663.78] yeah,
[10664.12 → 10664.96] it's just a fun dive.
[10665.50 → 10668.92] Seeing the numbers of these companies is interesting, and you know,
[10669.02 → 10669.56] you know,
[10669.56 → 10672.20] there's going to be like insane volume discounts,
[10672.20 → 10674.60] especially when you start getting to the numbers that we were talking about.
[10674.66 → 10676.30] Like it's going to be a totally different world.
[10676.86 → 10677.26] Um,
[10678.12 → 10679.62] but it's still interesting to see.
[10680.28 → 10682.70] It's a lot of money being pumped through IVs.
[10684.02 → 10684.42] Yeah,
[10684.46 → 10684.98] this is,
[10685.08 → 10685.28] uh,
[10685.28 → 10687.02] this is from arcane canned on Twitch.
[10687.24 → 10687.60] Uh,
[10687.60 → 10691.08] Twitch no longer offers big streamer contracts because Dan Clancy said,
[10691.20 → 10694.36] I can tell you the cost of retaining those streamers would have been far more
[10694.36 → 10695.40] than the revenue generated.
[10695.58 → 10697.30] That is something we've been very clear about.
[10697.44 → 10700.60] We don't want to do that because the only way to do that then is to have this
[10700.60 → 10702.94] imbalance where we make up for that on smaller streamers.
[10702.98 → 10703.08] Yeah.
[10703.08 → 10703.80] It makes a ton of sense.
[10705.50 → 10705.86] Yep.
[10706.68 → 10707.00] Yeah.
[10708.60 → 10708.94] Yeah.
[10708.94 → 10709.74] It's pretty wild.
[10710.34 → 10710.78] Um,
[10710.78 → 10711.20] and like,
[10711.20 → 10711.42] it's,
[10711.46 → 10712.04] it's an interesting,
[10712.14 → 10715.78] the streaming economy in general is fascinating because there's all these
[10715.78 → 10718.42] companies just losing money hand over fist.
[10719.00 → 10721.54] And then the viewers and a lot of the streamers,
[10721.54 → 10722.44] uh,
[10722.44 → 10726.66] are really mad because the viewers are angry because,
[10726.66 → 10727.16] uh,
[10727.16 → 10731.18] sites like Twitch are inputting more ads or making different viewing experiences,
[10731.18 → 10731.88] uh,
[10731.88 → 10735.74] worse in certain ways or potentially pressing the creators that they like.
[10735.74 → 10739.10] So they're mad for the creators to do like their own transcoding or whatever
[10739.10 → 10739.92] else we've seen.
[10740.56 → 10740.92] Um,
[10741.42 → 10745.50] and a lot of the creators want to make more money because obviously why not?
[10745.64 → 10746.50] Why wouldn't you want to make more money?
[10746.58 → 10747.46] Everyone wants to make more money.
[10748.06 → 10748.42] Um,
[10748.72 → 10751.72] but all the money's being burnt.
[10753.48 → 10754.62] So I don't know.
[10754.72 → 10755.44] It's interesting.
[10756.82 → 10758.08] VC money is a hell of a thing.
[10758.92 → 10759.32] Yeah.
[10763.28 → 10764.12] More questions.
[10764.32 → 10764.52] Yeah.
[10764.52 → 10766.98] During a CPU upgrade,
[10767.12 → 10771.92] the IHS was melted into the copper plate on the cooler.
[10772.18 → 10774.72] Half the pins were bent when I removed it from the motherboard.
[10775.14 → 10775.58] Uh,
[10775.58 → 10778.84] what is the worst thing that has happened to you during a CPU upgrade?
[10779.02 → 10780.18] That shouldn't be possible.
[10780.34 → 10780.84] That thing.
[10781.26 → 10781.46] Yeah.
[10781.88 → 10783.16] That doesn't make much sense.
[10783.26 → 10783.40] I mean,
[10783.42 → 10786.06] the worst that's happened to me is obviously dropping it.
[10789.82 → 10794.10] Worst thing I happened had happened was I was handling a hard drive while doing,
[10794.10 → 10794.50] uh,
[10794.50 → 10799.78] some work on my mineral oil computer and my hand was oily, and it went swoop.
[10801.54 → 10801.94] Nice.
[10801.94 → 10805.30] And there was nothing coming off that drive from there on.
[10806.64 → 10807.70] Was unfortunate.
[10808.96 → 10811.68] Just went to Facebook, and it has 29 viewers.
[10811.80 → 10812.82] So I underestimated.
[10812.94 → 10813.36] I'm sorry.
[10814.30 → 10815.18] I apologize.
[10815.82 → 10816.26] Sorry.
[10816.26 → 10816.54] I guess,
[10816.54 → 10817.44] I guess 20.
[10817.60 → 10818.78] I didn't count nine of you.
[10819.42 → 10819.66] Yeah.
[10820.54 → 10821.96] I was your mom.
[10822.00 → 10823.02] One of the ones you didn't count.
[10824.58 → 10826.94] She actually genuinely probably doesn't watch through Facebook.
[10827.18 → 10827.26] Yeah,
[10827.32 → 10827.44] no,
[10827.48 → 10827.72] I know.
[10827.72 → 10832.70] is a YouTube viewer.
[10832.94 → 10833.44] I suspect.
[10837.18 → 10837.58] Okay.
[10837.68 → 10838.14] Next up.
[10838.62 → 10838.90] Hi,
[10839.12 → 10839.62] LLD.
[10839.62 → 10845.08] I work for a major general contracting firm, and we are seeing some amazing technology come
[10845.08 → 10845.86] into construction.
[10846.06 → 10847.32] Do you think at a certain point,
[10847.40 → 10850.62] technology usage will plateau in skilled labour jobs?
[10850.62 → 10852.38] No,
[10852.84 → 10854.44] not personally.
[10855.10 → 10856.52] It'll just get faster,
[10856.64 → 10859.22] more efficient until we can like,
[10859.62 → 10861.54] just there's a building.
[10861.88 → 10863.88] There's going to be some amount of progress.
[10865.92 → 10866.52] Hey,
[10866.64 → 10867.18] LLD.
[10867.54 → 10871.04] I'm an ICU nurse and have long enjoyed watching your videos.
[10871.50 → 10874.54] Ever had a negative tech related healthcare experience?
[10874.74 → 10877.86] The amount of tech we use just to keep one person alive is wild.
[10877.86 → 10881.96] I haven't had too many healthcare experiences personally.
[10882.60 → 10883.46] So no,
[10883.56 → 10886.34] I can't say I've had a negative tech related experience.
[10887.76 → 10895.74] My only negative one was the ultrasound machine uses Windows CE, and it was hilarious watching
[10895.74 → 10896.62] it boots into Windows.
[10897.20 → 10904.88] I had a friend who is an MRI service technician and passed away over the COVID period.
[10904.88 → 10905.66] Um,
[10905.80 → 10910.88] and was working like insane hours because of COVID stuff.
[10911.22 → 10913.72] And just talking to him,
[10913.72 → 10920.30] the fact that all that stuff works in the song and dance that it has to work in is,
[10920.42 → 10921.64] is pretty impressive.
[10921.90 → 10923.60] IT people that work for hospitals.
[10924.90 → 10925.64] Good job.
[10925.64 → 10927.22] I think they're,
[10927.22 → 10927.54] um,
[10927.80 → 10929.82] they're nearly classed as biomedical engineers.
[10931.06 → 10931.56] Is that,
[10931.64 → 10931.90] I don't,
[10932.06 → 10932.74] I didn't ask him.
[10933.10 → 10933.24] Yeah.
[10933.34 → 10933.66] Yeah.
[10933.84 → 10934.14] I mean,
[10934.14 → 10934.94] it kind of depends.
[10935.08 → 10936.58] I know that some of them are like,
[10937.10 → 10939.80] if you want to think about it as IT for hospitals,
[10939.80 → 10942.08] but you need a special engineering degree just to,
[10942.20 → 10943.76] just to serve as a cow or something.
[10944.46 → 10945.58] It's kind of ridiculous.
[10945.80 → 10946.74] A computer on wheels.
[10946.82 → 10947.02] Sorry.
[10948.02 → 10948.42] Okay.
[10948.88 → 10949.24] Sorry.
[10949.24 → 10950.48] Sorry.
[10950.58 → 10951.84] It's like a computer on a cart.
[10952.00 → 10952.60] They call it a cow.
[10952.82 → 10953.06] Yeah.
[10953.06 → 10954.96] Not like veterinarian tech.
[10954.98 → 10955.52] I was like,
[10955.56 → 10956.98] I need an engineering degree.
[10957.00 → 10957.70] We're jumping to vets now.
[10957.80 → 10958.06] No,
[10958.12 → 10958.30] no.
[10958.40 → 10958.58] Sorry.
[10958.66 → 10958.84] Sorry.
[10958.94 → 10959.14] Yeah.
[10959.20 → 10959.34] Yeah.
[10959.34 → 10959.86] Sounds good.
[10960.06 → 10960.22] Hi,
[10960.28 → 10960.56] DLL.
[10960.92 → 10966.08] Do you figure wearing the Steve shirt during an Apple interview for senior software engineering
[10966.08 → 10967.24] position will be positive,
[10967.42 → 10967.66] neutral,
[10967.66 → 10968.40] or negative?
[10971.12 → 10971.96] That's interesting.
[10972.38 → 10972.78] Actually,
[10973.12 → 10976.30] I think it's going to depend on your interviewer.
[10976.30 → 10976.54] Yeah.
[10976.82 → 10978.00] A lot of it comes down to that.
[10978.00 → 10978.58] Yeah.
[10978.60 → 10979.88] You don't have to tell them where it's from.
[10981.20 → 10981.98] But I think,
[10982.08 → 10986.10] I think if they don't recognize the style of it,
[10986.16 → 10989.60] they probably aren't paying very close attention.
[10989.60 → 10991.02] So then it would be neutral.
[10991.22 → 10992.70] And if they do recognize it,
[10992.72 → 10997.78] I would say most people would probably think it's kind of cool that you have,
[10997.88 → 10998.10] you know,
[10998.14 → 10999.56] a Steve style shirt.
[11000.28 → 11002.14] You just don't tell them you got it from LTT store.
[11002.26 → 11002.52] Yeah.
[11002.64 → 11003.00] Probably.
[11003.22 → 11003.44] Yeah.
[11003.44 → 11004.68] I just might not mention that.
[11004.68 → 11005.08] Yeah.
[11005.08 → 11007.62] If they ask,
[11007.74 → 11008.60] just say Mac address.
[11009.92 → 11010.36] Yeah.
[11011.24 → 11013.04] It does have Mac address branding on it.
[11015.24 → 11015.74] All right.
[11015.74 → 11016.64] Let's see if I can get this one,
[11016.68 → 11016.82] right?
[11016.82 → 11017.74] Hello,
[11018.12 → 11018.58] Dynast,
[11018.82 → 11019.12] Nuke,
[11019.20 → 11019.90] and LAN,
[11020.32 → 11020.68] Mr.
[11020.92 → 11021.66] Lefrafarf,
[11021.96 → 11023.12] Lefrafarf.
[11024.30 → 11028.36] When picking back up an old project that was untouched for months,
[11028.82 → 11033.50] what do you do to regain interest in continuing and remembering what you have made?
[11034.54 → 11034.98] That's,
[11035.02 → 11035.34] that's all.
[11035.36 → 11036.50] That's the story of my life.
[11036.88 → 11037.62] Oh God.
[11037.78 → 11038.18] That's all.
[11038.30 → 11039.46] I'm glad it was just Luke.
[11039.76 → 11040.54] Preemptive work.
[11041.04 → 11041.52] Um,
[11041.74 → 11042.00] right.
[11042.00 → 11044.04] You got to try to leave good crumbs for yourself.
[11044.14 → 11045.28] I have a piece of my,
[11045.36 → 11045.58] uh,
[11045.58 → 11049.10] I have a piece of my motorbike sitting in our sandblasting thing right now.
[11049.72 → 11050.00] Uh,
[11050.00 → 11050.34] yes.
[11050.80 → 11051.16] Still.
[11051.86 → 11052.22] Yes.
[11052.40 → 11053.70] Wasn't that started years ago?
[11053.88 → 11054.08] Well,
[11054.24 → 11054.68] no,
[11054.74 → 11054.84] no,
[11054.86 → 11055.02] no.
[11055.02 → 11055.22] Well,
[11055.32 → 11056.52] no.
[11057.22 → 11057.58] Okay.
[11057.58 → 11059.00] It was started a year ago.
[11059.26 → 11059.46] Oh,
[11059.52 → 11060.18] I thought it was way.
[11060.18 → 11062.66] And I only put it in the sandblaster a week ago.
[11063.30 → 11068.10] And then I had to have Tynan help me because the bottom had to be taken out so that it could
[11068.10 → 11071.76] fit enough that I could actually get the gun and the hoses and everything to the right
[11071.76 → 11072.42] places on it.
[11072.44 → 11072.74] Anywho,
[11073.32 → 11073.62] uh,
[11073.62 → 11074.42] the point is,
[11074.74 → 11075.26] um,
[11076.24 → 11076.50] I,
[11076.56 → 11076.82] I,
[11076.90 → 11078.44] I put things in organized piles.
[11078.64 → 11078.86] Yeah.
[11078.92 → 11081.10] I label, and I make notes for myself.
[11081.48 → 11082.90] This is why I said preemptive work.
[11083.00 → 11083.46] Like I,
[11083.90 → 11084.48] Oh my God.
[11084.48 → 11087.70] It took me two and a half hours to change the windshield wipers on my tie can the other
[11087.70 → 11087.96] night.
[11090.18 → 11090.74] Why?
[11093.14 → 11096.48] You're either going to love my reason or you're going to hate it.
[11096.56 → 11096.98] Okay.
[11098.70 → 11099.82] So here's the thing.
[11100.32 → 11102.78] If you buy the full assembly,
[11102.78 → 11107.80] I think it costs somewhere in the neighbourhood of like 20 to $50,
[11108.18 → 11110.74] depending on the car and the bottle year and whatever else.
[11110.82 → 11110.96] Yeah.
[11111.18 → 11111.46] Okay.
[11111.46 → 11112.54] So it comes with,
[11112.74 → 11113.44] it comes,
[11113.74 → 11114.20] stop.
[11114.52 → 11115.26] Just stop.
[11115.36 → 11115.94] I love it though.
[11116.00 → 11116.12] Okay.
[11116.12 → 11117.38] So it comes with the
[11117.38 → 11117.62] the
[11117.74 → 11119.32] like the plastic and metal thing.
[11119.32 → 11122.12] And then there's like a clip, and it goes into the thing.
[11122.20 → 11124.20] You can get OEM ones from the manufacturer,
[11124.20 → 11127.74] or you can get third party ones as long as they have the right compatibility type or whatever
[11127.74 → 11127.98] else.
[11127.98 → 11128.20] Anyway,
[11128.64 → 11129.22] um,
[11129.22 → 11133.60] the more economical way.
[11133.60 → 11134.16] Um,
[11134.16 → 11135.82] and you can get these,
[11135.82 → 11136.50] uh,
[11136.50 → 11147.34] for as little as like a few dollars in some cases is to slide out the actual rubbers and buy new rubbers and put them in.
[11147.34 → 11148.06] Uh,
[11148.06 → 11148.62] in my case,
[11148.62 → 11150.48] I went with silicone blades,
[11150.48 → 11151.42] uh,
[11151.42 → 11156.82] because they have good performance characteristics, and they last a long time.
[11157.44 → 11160.08] And I was having a heck of a time.
[11160.14 → 11160.64] As it turns out,
[11160.66 → 11162.34] there's not a lot of people who,
[11162.50 → 11164.80] there's not a lot of people who drive Taycans.
[11165.22 → 11165.72] Um,
[11165.72 → 11167.48] so the resources for,
[11167.48 → 11168.20] you know,
[11168.38 → 11168.96] DIY,
[11168.96 → 11170.48] um,
[11171.66 → 11174.26] DIY projects on them are relatively limited.
[11174.26 → 11182.72] And the resources around trying to save $13 on your Taycan are especially limited.
[11182.72 → 11188.98] So I was searching for someone who makes just the rubber component,
[11188.98 → 11192.02] just the rubber strips that it can be,
[11192.08 → 11196.40] can be installed on a Taycan and then just swapped out,
[11196.40 → 11196.92] uh,
[11196.92 → 11197.74] just that part.
[11197.98 → 11198.42] Um,
[11200.00 → 11200.28] anyway,
[11200.40 → 11205.14] I ended up with this article that was like the top five windshield wipers for the Taycan.
[11205.28 → 11205.94] As it turns out,
[11206.04 → 11210.64] they hadn't tried installing any of these apparently because I ordered one of them.
[11210.64 → 11213.30] I ordered one of them where the pro,
[11213.46 → 11217.08] one of the pros was that they sell just the replacement rubber strips.
[11217.78 → 11218.16] I was like,
[11218.34 → 11218.68] great.
[11219.18 → 11220.08] So that's good.
[11220.18 → 11223.36] I will put on after market holders once.
[11224.00 → 11225.64] And then every other time after that,
[11225.68 → 11230.94] I won't have to throw away that whole assembly creating a bunch of unnecessary waste, and I'll save a buck.
[11231.16 → 11232.16] It'll be awesome.
[11233.62 → 11235.76] So they clearly never tried it.
[11236.54 → 11237.58] I ordered them.
[11237.96 → 11238.98] They didn't fit at all.
[11239.22 → 11240.52] Like it was immediately,
[11240.64 → 11243.10] obvious that they wouldn't fit credit to the store.
[11243.10 → 11243.76] I ordered from,
[11243.92 → 11245.38] I wish I could shout them out.
[11245.58 → 11248.70] They have a compatibility stage in their order fulfillment.
[11249.34 → 11250.22] And they actually,
[11250.46 → 11252.60] they ask you your car when you order windshield wipers.
[11252.96 → 11254.40] And they messaged me.
[11254.46 → 11254.78] They were like,
[11254.90 → 11255.14] Hey,
[11255.76 → 11257.18] we noticed this isn't compatible,
[11257.18 → 11258.34] like officially.
[11258.64 → 11260.70] So if you know something we don't know,
[11260.78 → 11262.48] then go ahead and click this button.
[11262.62 → 11264.14] And then you can't return them.
[11264.70 → 11265.08] And I was like,
[11265.50 → 11265.78] okay,
[11265.94 → 11266.32] fair enough.
[11266.32 → 11267.44] So they arrived.
[11267.52 → 11268.04] They don't fit at all.
[11268.44 → 11269.48] And cool.
[11269.56 → 11270.28] Cool of them though.
[11270.48 → 11270.66] Yeah.
[11270.72 → 11270.86] Yeah.
[11270.86 → 11271.24] That's very,
[11271.36 → 11271.98] very cool of them.
[11272.14 → 11273.62] And so I'm kind of sitting here going,
[11273.74 → 11274.04] okay,
[11274.78 → 11277.38] but I need new windshield wipers.
[11278.78 → 11279.30] Hmm.
[11279.30 → 11281.48] What can I do?
[11283.22 → 11283.98] Get this.
[11285.12 → 11287.80] The OEM Porsche assembly,
[11288.54 → 11294.34] other than having this weird little aerodynamic blade or something that comes out the other side.
[11295.30 → 11295.70] So,
[11295.80 → 11296.74] so it's got like,
[11297.04 → 11298.12] it's a shape like this.
[11298.18 → 11298.66] It's like this,
[11298.72 → 11299.12] like this.
[11299.16 → 11300.22] And then there's a third one.
[11300.26 → 11301.30] And then it comes out like that.
[11301.30 → 11302.58] It's like from profile,
[11302.68 → 11303.62] profile view of the thing.
[11304.28 → 11308.08] It has a fin that sticks out the other side that doesn't go against the windshield.
[11308.08 → 11310.02] And I don't know,
[11310.12 → 11310.34] whatever,
[11310.46 → 11310.80] who cares?
[11310.92 → 11311.88] Other than that thing,
[11312.08 → 11318.52] the actual profile of the rubber identical sort of get to that.
[11319.88 → 11321.28] So that got me thinking,
[11321.40 → 11321.62] huh?
[11323.10 → 11328.34] Maybe instead of putting on the third party assembly and then swapping the rubbers on that,
[11328.74 → 11332.52] I could just take the rubbers out of my third party assembly.
[11332.52 → 11336.86] And then I can just order more of them after if I can figure out how to get them into the OEM
[11336.86 → 11338.42] wiper blade assembly.
[11340.14 → 11340.50] Well,
[11340.54 → 11341.24] that took a while.
[11342.18 → 11342.54] First,
[11342.68 → 11346.96] I had to figure out how to disassemble the Porsche wiper blade,
[11347.14 → 11348.68] which it was very obvious to me.
[11348.70 → 11350.86] It has this plastic end cap that had some wiggle in it.
[11350.88 → 11353.12] So it clearly clicked on at some point.
[11353.64 → 11354.80] As it turns out,
[11354.96 → 11356.10] not designed to come off.
[11356.10 → 11358.28] It's not designed to come off at all.
[11358.36 → 11360.14] There's absolutely nothing you can do.
[11360.24 → 11361.86] No amount of prying, and I fix it.
[11361.92 → 11363.16] Anything under it could get that off.
[11363.36 → 11367.46] The only way I could get it off was to just forcibly rip the old rubber blade out.
[11367.86 → 11371.88] And then there are two metal strips that sandwich it.
[11371.88 → 11375.64] And as soon as you take the blade out,
[11375.70 → 11377.58] you can move them together, and you can pop the end off.
[11377.66 → 11382.08] So the way the assembly process works is they put it together and click on,
[11382.16 → 11384.14] but there's no way to remove them.
[11384.24 → 11385.20] These are at both ends.
[11386.08 → 11387.42] That was only part of the battle.
[11387.42 → 11394.24] I had to figure out how to hold these two stupid strips together while I fed the other thing through.
[11394.32 → 11395.80] It turns out that is not the way to do it.
[11396.02 → 11401.36] The best way to do it is actually to put the rubber thing into one
[11401.36 → 11404.06] and then put the other one on and then click the middle
[11404.06 → 11408.72] and then slide on these two little retaining clips and then pop the end caps on.
[11409.22 → 11414.34] But this is all trial and error because I can't find any resources for how to rebuild
[11414.34 → 11419.12] a Porsche stupid OEM wiper blade thing.
[11421.34 → 11425.00] So I don't know what my hourly rate is,
[11425.16 → 11428.30] but whatever it is,
[11428.66 → 11431.92] that was the world's most expensive windshield wiper change.
[11432.02 → 11433.06] I've only changed.
[11433.16 → 11434.90] I'm too cheap to generally do it.
[11434.94 → 11438.38] So I've only ever changed windshield wipers once, and it was on my current car.
[11438.54 → 11439.54] You live in Vancouver.
[11439.84 → 11440.50] Yeah, it's fine.
[11440.92 → 11441.50] Oh my God.
[11441.54 → 11441.88] No, it isn't.
[11441.94 → 11443.10] It's bad for your windshield.
[11443.10 → 11443.14] Windshield.
[11443.48 → 11444.42] It'll scratch it up.
[11444.52 → 11445.10] Windshield's fine.
[11447.18 → 11448.22] So I've done it once.
[11448.60 → 11451.14] I didn't know there were insert things,
[11451.58 → 11453.00] but I assumed.
[11453.52 → 11455.30] So I went to Canadian Tire and asked for them.
[11455.72 → 11456.92] They said they don't exist.
[11457.34 → 11459.56] They didn't tell me that they don't have them.
[11459.78 → 11460.72] They said they don't exist.
[11460.96 → 11461.42] And then I said,
[11461.48 → 11463.42] okay, what one of these things do I need for my car?
[11463.60 → 11464.62] And the guy handed me one.
[11464.82 → 11465.38] I went outside.
[11465.52 → 11466.70] It was clearly incorrect.
[11466.96 → 11468.46] I came directly back inside
[11468.46 → 11470.14] because my plan was just swapped it in the parking lot.
[11470.14 → 11470.78] Like, I don't care.
[11470.90 → 11471.10] Yeah.
[11471.36 → 11475.36] You were talking about opening the mattresses of the parking lot.
[11475.44 → 11476.10] But absolutely.
[11476.22 → 11477.70] I was doing maintenance on my car in the parking lot.
[11478.40 → 11479.22] I go back inside.
[11479.26 → 11480.14] I'm like, this is wrong.
[11480.24 → 11481.50] And they're like, you can't return it.
[11481.60 → 11482.62] So I ended up spending,
[11483.06 → 11484.36] if we're talking about hourly rate,
[11484.68 → 11486.28] longer than it was worth,
[11486.44 → 11487.64] convincing them to take it back.
[11487.70 → 11489.10] And they did eventually take it back.
[11489.22 → 11490.44] And then I bought the right one,
[11490.48 → 11491.72] which I just figured out by Googling.
[11492.28 → 11494.02] And then finally swapped it.
[11494.16 → 11494.84] And that was actually,
[11495.20 → 11495.70] I mean,
[11495.78 → 11497.00] other than debating with them
[11497.00 → 11498.64] about how I should be able to return something
[11498.64 → 11501.84] if they were literally the ones that told me it would work.
[11503.28 → 11503.68] Whatever.
[11505.32 → 11506.50] It ended up being very easy.
[11507.42 → 11507.78] Yeah.
[11508.00 → 11509.74] Took me like 45 seconds.
[11509.92 → 11510.18] Oh yeah.
[11510.24 → 11512.04] No, I know how easy it's supposed to be.
[11513.66 → 11515.04] Anyway, I learned something.
[11515.44 → 11517.20] And now all I have to do
[11517.20 → 11519.04] is order the replacement rubbers,
[11519.34 → 11521.12] which required some modification, by the way,
[11521.12 → 11524.70] because the way they click into the third party assembly,
[11525.10 → 11529.06] there's a little indentation in the moulding at the end
[11529.06 → 11531.26] where two little metal hooks kind of grab onto it.
[11531.30 → 11532.60] That doesn't exist on the Porsche one
[11532.60 → 11533.38] because it has end caps.
[11533.70 → 11534.58] So I have to cut that off,
[11534.64 → 11535.24] but that's fine
[11535.24 → 11537.64] because they're actually about a half an inch too long anyway.
[11537.80 → 11538.06] Okay.
[11538.10 → 11539.56] So I just cut that part off as long as,
[11539.56 → 11541.10] yeah, as long as I get a nice clean cut.
[11542.40 → 11543.28] They work great.
[11543.62 → 11544.62] I renewed my windshield.
[11545.04 → 11546.38] I put on my new windshield wipers
[11546.38 → 11549.88] and it's like dead silent, everything removed.
[11550.14 → 11551.00] I'm very happy.
[11551.48 → 11552.44] There's some kind of,
[11552.62 → 11556.26] there's something in either the rubbers
[11556.26 → 11560.34] or something that causes a metallic residue on your fingers.
[11560.58 → 11561.72] Never figured that out.
[11562.72 → 11564.56] That formed at some point.
[11564.74 → 11568.56] Most likely carbon or graphite lubricant.
[11568.78 → 11570.18] Why would that be on?
[11571.70 → 11573.04] Why would that be on there?
[11573.12 → 11573.42] Yeah.
[11573.42 → 11574.12] To help you get it in?
[11574.30 → 11574.50] Yeah.
[11575.28 → 11576.00] Oh, okay.
[11576.78 → 11577.52] All right, cool.
[11578.52 → 11579.22] Unironically, Luke.
[11579.36 → 11579.58] Yeah.
[11579.76 → 11580.68] I know, I know, I know.
[11580.70 → 11582.34] Stop that cheesy little grin.
[11583.24 → 11584.24] You put that away.
[11586.38 → 11587.88] That would be, that would be my answer.
[11587.98 → 11590.36] Anyway, someone asked if I made a guide
[11590.36 → 11591.56] now that I have figured it out.
[11591.62 → 11593.30] The answer is no, I didn't.
[11593.36 → 11595.16] It was very late by the time I was done.
[11595.52 → 11596.66] Maybe next time, you know,
[11596.66 → 11597.72] I'll upload a YouTube short.
[11597.72 → 11599.50] That would be a fun, yeah, that would be a fun channel.
[11599.66 → 11601.86] Linus tries to change his windshield wipers.
[11602.10 → 11607.18] Like saving $10 by spending hundreds of dollars worth of hours.
[11607.82 → 11609.50] And that's the whole premise of the channel.
[11609.66 → 11610.00] Yeah.
[11610.34 → 11610.90] That would be sweet.
[11611.04 → 11611.30] Yeah.
[11611.30 → 11612.26] I'd watch it.
[11612.84 → 11613.38] You know what?
[11613.44 → 11614.24] I'd watch it too.
[11614.42 → 11615.20] They'd have two viewers.
[11615.62 → 11615.92] Yeah.
[11616.14 → 11617.50] I mean, oh man.
[11617.90 → 11623.06] It's like, I, I, you know, I've got a, I've got a button fell off of this shirt
[11623.06 → 11626.14] and the only way to get a new button is to like travel to Pakistan
[11626.14 → 11627.60] to the factory where they made it.
[11627.84 → 11628.20] Yeah.
[11628.60 → 11630.00] See, that would be awesome.
[11630.62 → 11631.92] I would love that.
[11631.92 → 11633.36] It's like not even sort of worth it.
[11633.62 → 11635.56] Not only are you like spending more money.
[11635.56 → 11636.40] I love this.
[11636.40 → 11637.94] I would definitely watch this series.
[11637.94 → 11638.26] But also waste tons of time.
[11638.96 → 11639.76] That'd be sweet.
[11640.16 → 11641.32] That'd be so sweet.
[11641.52 → 11644.62] Oh, I, I do probably have security footage of me doing this.
[11645.22 → 11646.22] Hold on a second.
[11647.16 → 11648.00] Oh man.
[11649.54 → 11651.62] That's how we resurrect channel super fun.
[11651.82 → 11652.78] No, that's not fun.
[11653.60 → 11654.88] That's channel super frustrating.
[11655.48 → 11655.92] Yeah.
[11656.10 → 11656.82] New spin off.
[11656.84 → 11658.20] But it's fun for the viewer.
[11658.68 → 11662.64] Wasting $30,000 of my time to save 65 cents.
[11662.64 → 11668.40] I mean, I've done that before on my car where the part that I'm trying to change is like $4
[11668.40 → 11671.86] and then it takes me 15 hours to change the part.
[11672.08 → 11673.48] But that's like doing maintenance.
[11673.96 → 11678.92] And Mercedes would charge me, I think the last one I did was like six grand
[11678.92 → 11681.06] because you have to take the dashboard out.
[11681.18 → 11682.10] Oh my God.
[11682.10 → 11687.74] But if you know how to do it, you can do it by crawling underneath with a pair of a couple pliers and redo it.
[11688.22 → 11690.82] So you don't have to take anything out, but it does take ages.
[11690.82 → 11693.60] So basically you're saying you want to be the host of this channel.
[11693.78 → 11694.36] No, no, no.
[11694.40 → 11698.04] I'm saying that's a reasonable way to save thousands of dollars.
[11698.42 → 11700.00] What you're doing is not.
[11700.18 → 11702.76] Like replacing a button, and you have to go to Pakistan.
[11703.68 → 11705.76] Or like, you know.
[11706.42 → 11714.12] But I mean, stuff like that is, like consumables can get really expensive, and it's unnecessary as well.
[11715.88 → 11717.56] What night did I do this?
[11717.56 → 11718.92] It was a while back.
[11718.92 → 11720.86] Like, why is this?
[11721.14 → 11722.92] Yeah, see Colburn gets it.
[11723.20 → 11724.26] It's not about the wipers.
[11724.44 → 11725.74] It's about not letting them win.
[11726.08 → 11726.74] Yeah, I am.
[11726.78 → 11728.28] I am so for that mindset.
[11728.46 → 11728.70] Yeah.
[11728.82 → 11732.36] That's one of the reasons I respect Linus so much is because he does shit like that.
[11732.40 → 11732.98] It's awesome.
[11733.46 → 11734.08] Like, yeah.
[11734.38 → 11735.92] I don't care how much your car costs.
[11736.28 → 11736.72] I'm not spending.
[11736.86 → 11738.06] I already bought the car.
[11738.82 → 11739.26] Yeah.
[11739.64 → 11740.04] Yeah.
[11740.26 → 11740.58] Yeah.
[11740.58 → 11742.70] That's exactly why I don't want to spend more.
[11742.70 → 11746.04] There's already a perfectly fine wiper assembly on the car.
[11746.04 → 11748.02] And there's obviously like a consort.
[11748.42 → 11749.50] It's like light bulbs, right?
[11749.52 → 11752.62] They all got together, and they're going to go, okay, well, these wiper blades are going to fail.
[11752.62 → 11762.42] Like, how much material science and experience have you had in the world with every single car ever having wiper blades, and you can't make them last longer than three months?
[11762.42 → 11763.02] Linus.
[11765.36 → 11771.30] I have very strong feelings about a lot of things that Linus is describing that he did.
[11771.38 → 11772.58] So I'm like, yes!
[11773.54 → 11774.52] You go, Linus.
[11775.28 → 11776.06] Thanks, Dan.
[11776.20 → 11776.88] You go, too.
[11780.90 → 11781.68] Oh, you know what?
[11781.70 → 11782.88] I can figure out when I did this.
[11782.88 → 11784.22] Have I effectively stalled for time yet?
[11784.50 → 11784.78] No, no.
[11784.82 → 11790.18] I can figure out when I did this because I created a doc for myself.
[11791.18 → 11791.42] Okay.
[11791.42 → 11795.08] So, yeah, we're coming all the way back to what actually got us here.
[11795.22 → 11800.18] Auto care, car documents, and tips, keywords, Taycan, car windshield wipers, Rain-X.
[11800.34 → 11803.44] Yeah, because you have to help find things at Google Drive because the search is so bad.
[11803.54 → 11804.36] Yeah, so details.
[11804.50 → 11804.76] Hold on.
[11804.82 → 11807.72] I created this doc January 27th.
[11807.72 → 11812.46] So, okay, that'll help me narrow down where exactly I need to go to find my little project.
[11812.46 → 11821.40] So, yeah, we were talking about how you pick up the merch message from half an hour ago was we were talking about how you re-pick up projects or tasks.
[11821.42 → 11823.70] Or whatever that you've put down for a significant period of time.
[11823.88 → 11829.48] And the core idea was that it's all in the preemptive work.
[11829.54 → 11832.90] It's all in the work that you do while you're already working on that project.
[11832.90 → 11838.28] And that is generally note-taking, organization, planning, stuff like that.
[11838.44 → 11839.90] I don't know what Linus is trying to do.
[11840.44 → 11844.78] And you can extrapolate this to things that aren't serious as well.
[11844.84 → 11846.40] So you should do this for things that are serious.
[11846.90 → 11848.56] I think we want to switch to...
[11849.26 → 11849.68] Yeah, go ahead.
[11849.68 → 11850.90] Oh, no, that's the wrong one.
[11851.16 → 11852.04] Uh, that one.
[11853.12 → 11854.18] So there it is.
[11854.80 → 11855.84] That's how to do it.
[11856.78 → 11857.96] Yeah, give yourself notes.
[11860.20 → 11861.10] Keywords are key.
[11861.94 → 11862.78] Uh, here also.
[11864.22 → 11865.76] Uh, here I am.
[11867.36 → 11868.02] Uh, yeah, here I am.
[11871.60 → 11872.76] It's such a low-tech way.
[11874.22 → 11874.96] It works.
[11875.10 → 11876.10] You can see the timescale here.
[11876.10 → 11881.26] Reading, researching, inspecting.
[11882.64 → 11886.22] So we're, like, nearly an hour now?
[11887.88 → 11888.36] Yep.
[11900.44 → 11903.86] This is the most ADHD thing I think I've ever seen.
[11906.10 → 11908.90] Okay, I think by this point I have switched to Rain.
[11909.66 → 11910.34] So, uh...
[11910.34 → 11911.28] It's about an hour and a half?
[11911.72 → 11912.02] Yeah.
[11912.92 → 11914.04] It's not too bad, actually.
[11916.16 → 11917.88] I'm so frustrated because, like...
[11919.36 → 11921.60] It shouldn't be that hard.
[11921.72 → 11923.12] It's a little plastic clip.
[11923.60 → 11924.88] It can't be that hard to...
[11925.40 → 11926.88] But if I break it...
[11927.46 → 11929.80] Well, I have to buy a whole new one.
[11929.92 → 11932.40] And I'm not going to have new windshield wipers on my car tonight.
[11932.40 → 11937.58] And I can't put my old ones back on because I ripped the rubbers out.
[11938.72 → 11941.68] So unless I can get it apart, I got no way to put it back together.
[11942.40 → 11944.76] You know, uh, Darius?
[11945.52 → 11946.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11946.36 → 11950.20] At the whale land that we had in the lab warehouse?
[11951.42 → 11954.54] Uh, that night was a very interesting night for a few people.
[11954.88 → 11957.52] I ended up, I think, staying there and gaming.
[11957.68 → 11959.52] No, I think I went to go sleep for a little...
[11959.52 → 11960.54] I don't remember what happened to me.
[11960.54 → 11967.50] Um, my dad stayed up all night and then went and, uh, taught a plumbing lecture.
[11967.82 → 11971.06] And then came back and kept gaming, so he didn't sleep at all.
[11971.26 → 11973.70] And Darius, I thought he went home to go sleep.
[11973.88 → 11977.80] He went home, remembered that his truck was, like, partially taken apart.
[11978.14 → 11980.16] And, like, I don't remember exactly what he did.
[11980.44 → 11985.22] He, like, uh, replaced the fuel injectors or something?
[11985.24 → 11985.92] I don't remember what it was.
[11985.94 → 11988.26] But he did this, like, whole maintenance project on his truck
[11988.26 → 11990.22] for the entire duration of the night.
[11990.32 → 11991.96] Didn't sleep at all and then came back.
[11992.48 → 11994.78] Um, which was why when he was in the Left 4 Dead tournament
[11994.78 → 11998.44] before the finals game, he, he, he jumped out of his chair
[11998.44 → 11999.62] and just did a bunch of push-ups
[11999.62 → 12000.96] because he was trying to, like, get his blood flowing
[12000.96 → 12003.68] so he could wake up so he could play better.
[12005.20 → 12006.78] Playing absolute mad lad.
[12006.84 → 12009.70] I very much enjoy surrounding myself with these types of people.
[12009.70 → 12014.06] It's a very interesting life.
[12015.58 → 12018.04] Baron Ninja says, Luke's dad is a machine.
[12018.70 → 12021.64] Yeah, we're, we're, we're convinced, too.
[12021.86 → 12022.10] Yeah.
[12023.94 → 12026.48] Yeah, that was a that was a heck of a weekend.
[12031.12 → 12032.28] All right, Dan, hit us.
[12032.48 → 12032.78] Sure thing.
[12032.78 → 12037.52] Hey, Duke, LAN, and Dynast, what are some of your favourite 4K HDR movies
[12037.52 → 12040.02] to show off QD OLED TVs?
[12040.60 → 12043.40] Also, I watched Hackers, and it was ridiculously cheesy
[12043.40 → 12044.72] and hilarious at the same time.
[12044.96 → 12045.56] Thanks for the tip.
[12046.22 → 12047.02] No problem.
[12047.14 → 12049.56] Uh, Encanto, bad ending to that movie.
[12049.80 → 12051.84] Uh, absolute visual fiesta.
[12052.04 → 12052.98] It's so beautiful.
[12054.06 → 12056.32] Uh, that's, that's definitely my favourite right now.
[12056.32 → 12061.06] I apologize if this has already been asked,
[12061.20 → 12064.58] but what is Linus's opinion of the MIG switch
[12064.58 → 12066.32] that was announced at the end of last year
[12066.32 → 12067.74] and is set to release this month?
[12068.26 → 12071.56] Okay, this is my first exposure to the MIG switch.
[12072.14 → 12076.30] It appears to be a, uh, an R4
[12076.30 → 12079.52] or whatever, whatever that thing was called for the DS.
[12081.12 → 12082.44] Oh, this.
[12082.76 → 12083.24] Yeah.
[12083.90 → 12085.14] I didn't know it was called that.
[12085.14 → 12087.14] And honestly, based on the website,
[12087.22 → 12088.36] it's kind of hard to tell, but yeah.
[12089.00 → 12090.50] Looks sketch.
[12093.34 → 12094.82] What am I even looking at here?
[12094.88 → 12095.64] Is that Rasputin?
[12095.88 → 12098.18] I don't know who it is, but, uh.
[12098.22 → 12098.84] Oh, it is.
[12098.92 → 12099.54] Yeah, it totally is.
[12100.16 → 12100.48] Yeah.
[12100.82 → 12101.98] Uh, what, Ben, what was that?
[12102.08 → 12102.74] The sense of the colours.
[12102.74 → 12105.42] What was the one before the R4, R4DS?
[12105.68 → 12106.58] Or like, what, what, what are,
[12106.68 → 12107.76] what are these things called?
[12107.90 → 12109.10] Just like, um.
[12109.86 → 12110.38] I don't know.
[12110.48 → 12110.84] I don't know.
[12110.90 → 12112.70] Just like pirate, pirate cartridge.
[12113.06 → 12114.70] It's a non-hardware modification.
[12115.14 → 12116.08] Way to.
[12116.48 → 12116.84] Flashcards.
[12117.30 → 12117.74] Flashcards.
[12117.80 → 12118.44] Okay, there you go.
[12118.44 → 12119.00] Flashcard.
[12119.70 → 12120.86] Um, I don't know.
[12120.94 → 12123.04] I would be, I'd be interested in trying it.
[12124.74 → 12126.86] Make Switch is the only backup and development device
[12126.86 → 12128.00] for all Switch consoles,
[12128.12 → 12131.16] regardless of version, firmware, and type.
[12131.42 → 12132.58] That's wild.
[12132.82 → 12135.72] And requires no installation or modification of the console.
[12135.86 → 12136.72] Just plug and play.
[12136.72 → 12141.34] I am, I'm surprised that the Switch got this broken.
[12143.78 → 12144.22] Hmm.
[12144.48 → 12145.94] Right before the new one comes out.
[12146.90 → 12148.18] Or gets announced, at least.
[12150.70 → 12152.08] Yeah, kind of bad timing.
[12152.68 → 12156.06] Um, you know, it's like, yeah, you can pirate games on the Switch.
[12156.28 → 12156.84] And finally.
[12157.48 → 12157.84] Um.
[12158.38 → 12162.36] I mean, if you can, if you can, I mean, it's still cool.
[12163.00 → 12163.70] It's still very cool.
[12164.66 → 12166.68] Because you can get micro SD cards that are like a terabyte.
[12167.02 → 12167.22] Right?
[12168.56 → 12169.26] Uh, yeah.
[12169.42 → 12170.20] Yeah, I think so.
[12170.72 → 12172.78] So, I apparently can't buy one.
[12173.14 → 12174.06] I go to the website.
[12174.30 → 12174.44] Oh.
[12174.74 → 12174.98] Backup.
[12174.98 → 12179.92] So, they either got taken down, or they're not up yet, or something like that.
[12180.22 → 12182.24] Yeah, one terabyte micro SD card is a hundred bucks.
[12182.34 → 12184.34] You pair that with this thing, you got a lot of games.
[12184.70 → 12186.24] Super easy to get in China.
[12187.30 → 12189.04] Uh, France, apparently pretty easy.
[12189.04 → 12190.28] Italy, no problem.
[12190.86 → 12192.28] Mexico, no problem.
[12193.10 → 12194.52] Uh, watch out, guys.
[12194.62 → 12200.02] Something to keep in mind is that, uh, these can be illegal, depending on where you're from,
[12200.02 → 12205.02] even if you use them for their official purpose, which is to back up your own cartridges.
[12205.58 → 12210.56] Uh, so yeah, thoughts are, yep, this is a thing that apparently exists.
[12210.90 → 12215.96] I am very curious to try it, but I also, uh, does anyone have one?
[12216.06 → 12216.94] Like, are you guys?
[12218.50 → 12223.00] Uh, so the Canadian store doesn't work, but you can go to American stores that ship to Canada.
[12223.62 → 12224.12] Oh, okay.
[12226.22 → 12227.18] Yeah, I'm kind of curious.
[12227.18 → 12228.16] I think this is just Shopify.
[12228.16 → 12231.52] Yeah, there's just Shopify stores that ship to Canada.
[12231.70 → 12232.52] Got it, okay.
[12235.86 → 12236.72] Yeah, interesting.
[12237.00 → 12240.92] You can get Switch banned with these, um, says McBain.
[12242.72 → 12245.46] Nintendo can ban the game's unique serial number?
[12245.62 → 12246.38] Oh, very interesting.
[12246.74 → 12247.38] I don't know.
[12247.52 → 12249.32] I just, I just buy my games, guys.
[12249.50 → 12250.04] I, um.
[12250.44 → 12251.76] I am at that era as well.
[12251.88 → 12254.42] Yeah, like I, I, uh.
[12254.42 → 12256.74] I don't subscribe to services, though.
[12256.74 → 12258.36] Yeah, yeah, that's fair enough.
[12260.10 → 12266.20] Yeah, if I was, if I wanted to, if I wanted to rip off Nintendo, I think, uh, a Steam Deck
[12266.20 → 12271.74] and emulation is probably the route I would go, or a, um, an ally in emulation if you need
[12271.74 → 12272.60] the extra performance.
[12273.38 → 12273.58] Yeah.
[12273.58 → 12274.42] Yeah, yeah.
[12274.42 → 12274.94] Yeah, all right.
[12275.14 → 12275.40] Okay.
[12276.34 → 12277.06] What else we got?
[12277.22 → 12278.34] Oh, uh, let's see.
[12278.54 → 12283.84] Hey, LLD, my wife bailed on the Pokémon franchise when she lost the ability to have the entire
[12283.84 → 12285.40] Pokédex in one game.
[12285.78 → 12288.30] What franchise do you feel has let you down the most?
[12288.40 → 12289.52] That's an interesting take.
[12289.82 → 12293.58] If your tagline is, you have to catch them all, and then you're just like, you can't.
[12294.56 → 12294.82] Yeah.
[12295.78 → 12296.42] But I feel like-
[12296.42 → 12297.14] That is a pretty interesting take.
[12297.14 → 12301.24] Eventually, the sheer number of Pokémon, because they're always releasing new ones so that
[12301.24 → 12304.74] you have new ones to collect, would have just been, it would have just gotten completely
[12304.74 → 12305.32] unmanageable.
[12305.40 → 12306.16] Like, how many are there now?
[12306.20 → 12309.62] There's like 150 in Pokémon Blue and Red, if I recall correctly.
[12309.92 → 12310.22] That's right.
[12310.36 → 12310.78] First gen.
[12311.48 → 12312.44] Is it 150?
[12313.18 → 12313.54] 151.
[12314.40 → 12315.02] Oh, sorry.
[12315.26 → 12315.64] Got him.
[12315.64 → 12316.88] Yeah, 1025.
[12316.88 → 12319.50] You ben't in the game, so maybe you are correct.
[12319.72 → 12321.42] But in that generation, there's 151.
[12321.56 → 12321.96] Yeah, okay.
[12322.00 → 12323.02] You said the games, though.
[12323.98 → 12325.04] 1015, is that what you said?
[12325.68 → 12326.48] 1025, apparently.
[12326.48 → 12327.14] 1025?
[12327.50 → 12328.34] Over 1,000.
[12328.42 → 12329.06] Let's say that.
[12329.26 → 12329.54] Yeah.
[12329.96 → 12336.80] Like, how could you possibly hope to balance a game that has 1,000 playable, battleable
[12336.80 → 12337.44] Pokémon in it?
[12337.44 → 12341.00] Yeah, and you can put all those Pokémon in something called Pokémon Home that I don't
[12341.00 → 12344.48] know anything about, but I know you can put Pokémon there from all the different games.
[12345.90 → 12347.18] Yeah, like, that's ridiculous.
[12347.38 → 12348.02] No, I get it.
[12348.24 → 12351.10] What franchise has let you down the most, though?
[12351.14 → 12352.82] I mean, it's got to be Final Fantasy for me.
[12353.76 → 12357.28] I loved the games, and then I just didn't.
[12357.50 → 12358.54] Can I just say a company?
[12360.48 → 12360.84] Blizzard.
[12361.42 → 12361.74] Bethesda.
[12362.10 → 12362.40] Oh.
[12363.72 → 12364.68] But also Blizzard.
[12364.96 → 12365.96] Games that start with B.
[12365.96 → 12369.30] Are you off the Starfield, like, bandwagon now?
[12369.30 → 12369.50] Yeah.
[12369.64 → 12369.88] Yeah?
[12369.96 → 12371.00] Okay, so you're just over it?
[12371.16 → 12372.58] Yeah, I tried really hard.
[12372.60 → 12373.20] You really did.
[12373.44 → 12374.96] It was sort of admirable, almost.
[12374.96 → 12376.78] I gave it every effort I possibly could.
[12376.78 → 12377.54] Yeah, you really did.
[12377.56 → 12378.64] It was actually kind of sad.
[12378.80 → 12379.08] Yeah.
[12379.60 → 12380.52] Sad to watch.
[12380.70 → 12380.90] Yeah.
[12381.06 → 12381.30] Yeah.
[12381.72 → 12384.94] The disillusionment, it only comes that much stronger.
[12384.96 → 12386.20] It was replaced with rage.
[12386.22 → 12387.18] When you try that hard.
[12387.24 → 12387.46] Yeah.
[12387.46 → 12391.18] Like, is it less of a piece of shit now, or is it just...
[12391.18 → 12391.36] No.
[12391.64 → 12392.32] Yeah, okay.
[12393.22 → 12393.44] No.
[12394.10 → 12394.44] Cool.
[12394.56 → 12399.40] And I have no faith that it will get cyberpunked, because the problem, in my opinion...
[12399.40 → 12401.24] Ashton Kutcher's just not that into it anymore.
[12404.40 → 12405.16] That took me a sec.
[12405.16 → 12406.14] They're on fire tonight.
[12406.20 → 12407.04] That took me a sec.
[12407.10 → 12408.66] These have been very high quality.
[12408.74 → 12409.66] That was a deep cut.
[12409.72 → 12411.02] I am appreciative.
[12411.32 → 12411.68] Wow.
[12412.14 → 12413.36] He's not there to fix it.
[12413.36 → 12415.58] In my opinion, the problem is the company.
[12416.56 → 12416.68] Yeah.
[12416.68 → 12420.38] And that's why I wanted to say a company, not an individual franchise.
[12420.88 → 12422.70] I don't think they're capable anymore.
[12423.12 → 12423.30] Right.
[12423.30 → 12424.18] I actually don't.
[12424.58 → 12431.10] Because you look at the trajectory ever since Oblivion, and actually, in my opinion, every
[12431.10 → 12437.64] game from every franchise from Bethesda ever since Oblivion has been some form of regression,
[12437.76 → 12440.40] and people are going to be pissed off because everyone loved Skyrim.
[12440.40 → 12444.44] But in my opinion, Skyrim was kind of the beginning of the end.
[12446.02 → 12448.70] In like a huge amount of different ways.
[12449.42 → 12449.58] Okay.
[12449.82 → 12456.38] But maybe Blizzard never let you down because...
[12456.38 → 12457.10] Hold on.
[12457.22 → 12459.52] First, this is a different company, and also I don't agree.
[12459.82 → 12460.38] Hold on.
[12462.24 → 12465.48] Because maybe Blizzard just changed their name.
[12466.06 → 12466.40] Okay.
[12466.40 → 12467.48] Have you seen this?
[12467.60 → 12467.90] No.
[12468.90 → 12469.42] Storm gate.
[12469.42 → 12470.34] Gameplay reveal.
[12471.30 → 12473.54] Is this like some of the original devs or something?
[12473.72 → 12477.82] This is folks who worked on Star Craft and Warcraft 3.
[12478.54 → 12479.82] They just...
[12479.82 → 12482.80] Oh, that looks so cool.
[12482.90 → 12485.46] They just shattered their Kickstarter.
[12487.52 → 12488.48] Seven months ago.
[12488.54 → 12489.68] How had I never heard about this?
[12489.86 → 12491.26] I'm not sure how you missed this.
[12491.36 → 12492.18] Look at that micro.
[12492.18 → 12495.78] I love the art style.
[12496.20 → 12496.46] Yeah.
[12496.72 → 12500.04] It's so defined, and everything's really easy to read.
[12500.40 → 12502.88] And we've been watching this for 40 seconds and understand whatever.
[12502.88 → 12505.12] RTS games are notoriously difficult to follow.
[12505.48 → 12506.38] So, so good.
[12506.38 → 12509.34] And I've never even seen this game before, and I can fully understand what's going on.
[12509.48 → 12510.88] Great character models.
[12511.34 → 12511.56] Yeah.
[12511.66 → 12512.42] Love the UI.
[12512.42 → 12515.20] And even like the terrain as well.
[12515.30 → 12517.42] Like the trees and all the terrain is...
[12518.58 → 12519.18] Looks great.
[12519.38 → 12519.92] There's a lot of...
[12519.92 → 12520.58] Fits in really well.
[12520.68 → 12522.48] There are a lot of really cool ideas.
[12522.86 → 12525.56] I am floored that you haven't seen any of this yet.
[12525.56 → 12525.66] That's what it's called.
[12525.74 → 12526.22] Storm gate.
[12526.22 → 12526.80] Storm gate, it's called?
[12526.90 → 12527.04] Yeah.
[12527.16 → 12528.94] I've maybe heard of it, but I haven't seen that video.
[12529.02 → 12529.58] Don't pre-order.
[12529.94 → 12530.84] You know, whatever.
[12531.04 → 12533.48] But also, it seems like what they're doing is really cool.
[12533.58 → 12535.66] So if you want to support it, then...
[12535.66 → 12537.42] Is there an estimated...
[12537.42 → 12540.08] I don't remember.
[12540.08 → 12541.08] Or...
[12541.08 → 12544.28] People are talking about modded versions of the Elder Scrolls.
[12544.58 → 12544.82] Yeah.
[12545.04 → 12546.64] But that's not the game.
[12547.82 → 12548.34] There's...
[12548.34 → 12550.46] Skyrim modding is fantastic.
[12550.98 → 12557.56] Starfield modding is required to even have a potential of enjoying any percentage of the
[12557.56 → 12560.40] game, but is nowhere near as good.
[12560.50 → 12565.18] The person who made the multiplayer mod for Skyrim was looking into playing...
[12565.18 → 12567.40] Making a multiplayer mod for Starfield.
[12567.68 → 12568.46] And just didn't bother.
[12568.46 → 12571.66] His quote on it, I wish I could find it.
[12571.66 → 12573.10] He just eviscerated them.
[12573.44 → 12573.60] Yeah.
[12574.32 → 12575.52] It was brutal.
[12575.86 → 12576.20] Like...
[12576.20 → 12577.84] Back to something that maybe doesn't suck.
[12578.50 → 12578.94] Storm gate.
[12579.22 → 12579.46] Yeah.
[12579.70 → 12580.86] Is this the future?
[12581.64 → 12586.42] Looking at all the layoffs in the games' industry, looking at all the challenges facing AAA gaming
[12586.42 → 12591.56] and the enormous budgets required to bring the next GTA or the next Call of Duty or whatever
[12591.56 → 12592.32] it is to market.
[12593.72 → 12595.06] Don't people just want fun?
[12595.62 → 12597.46] I strongly believe so.
[12597.52 → 12599.08] Don't people just want Battle Bit?
[12599.24 → 12600.48] I strongly believe so.
[12600.82 → 12600.94] And...
[12600.94 → 12601.40] Battle Bit is...
[12601.40 → 12602.44] I still enjoy Battle Bit.
[12602.52 → 12603.42] I still play every once in a while.
[12603.62 → 12604.14] And...
[12604.14 → 12605.22] Love it.
[12606.54 → 12607.48] Like I...
[12607.48 → 12607.92] Where...
[12607.92 → 12609.38] What the heck happened to RTS?
[12610.22 → 12610.46] Yeah.
[12610.90 → 12611.34] What is it?
[12611.34 → 12612.12] It's not as...
[12612.12 → 12613.74] It's not as profitable as the gotcha game.
[12613.80 → 12614.54] Like how did we get...
[12614.54 → 12618.84] I think RTS is harder to continually monetize through microtransactions because people don't
[12618.84 → 12619.68] care as much about the skins.
[12619.76 → 12625.08] Luke, how did we get two f***ING Diablo's since the last RTS from Blizzard?
[12625.64 → 12625.88] Yeah.
[12625.88 → 12627.06] How does that make any sense?
[12627.50 → 12627.70] Yeah.
[12628.16 → 12631.36] It might be smaller teams making more bespoke things.
[12633.70 → 12634.76] Baldur's Gate is not an RTS.
[12634.76 → 12638.98] I'm trying so hard to not somehow force Baldur's Gate into this conversation.
[12639.30 → 12640.04] And yeah, it's not an RTS.
[12640.20 → 12640.38] Come on.
[12640.46 → 12640.60] No.
[12640.60 → 12642.94] I think that's one to force myself into this conversation.
[12643.06 → 12645.76] That's one of the things that amazed me about Pal World when I tried it for the first
[12645.76 → 12646.00] time.
[12646.14 → 12646.36] Yeah.
[12646.42 → 12647.84] It was just a game.
[12648.12 → 12648.82] It's just fun.
[12648.82 → 12651.98] You push go, and then you're playing the video game.
[12651.98 → 12655.14] There's no stuff that wastes your time.
[12655.88 → 12660.34] Um, one thing that I figured that wasted my time with the most was Death Stranding.
[12660.96 → 12663.66] That was a huge, respecting game.
[12663.80 → 12665.44] Same with probably Starfield as well.
[12666.12 → 12666.70] But Pal World?
[12667.10 → 12667.40] Mario...
[12667.40 → 12668.68] The first Mario Party for Switch.
[12668.98 → 12670.70] Whatever the name of that one is.
[12670.88 → 12671.26] Just had...
[12671.26 → 12671.62] That was brutal.
[12671.62 → 12673.76] Just let me play the video game.
[12673.90 → 12675.46] Let me have fun, please.
[12675.50 → 12677.34] And they could have patched it so easily.
[12677.70 → 12682.10] All they had to do was make cut scenes skippable, and the game would have been way better.
[12682.60 → 12683.46] Even, even...
[12683.46 → 12684.82] I'm going to mention BG3 now.
[12684.94 → 12685.56] Even BG3.
[12685.56 → 12688.96] You just hit the right mouse button and then the line is gone.
[12689.22 → 12689.50] Right?
[12689.78 → 12695.74] Going from that, where I can skip through dialogue really quickly or listen to it, and then going
[12695.74 → 12696.26] to Starfield?
[12696.74 → 12697.06] Terrible.
[12697.30 → 12697.68] I don't know.
[12698.62 → 12701.74] Storm gate will be released on early access through Steam in 2024.
[12702.36 → 12704.18] D Martinez says,
[12704.18 → 12709.70] The game is boring, bland, and the main draw of Bethesda games, exploration in a lively and
[12709.70 → 12711.64] handcrafted world, was completely gone.
[12711.88 → 12712.32] The fodder will.
[12712.32 → 12712.46] Dude.
[12712.70 → 12717.10] I'm not going to put my heart and soul into a mod for a game as mediocre as this.
[12718.42 → 12718.78] Oh!
[12719.14 → 12719.64] Get him!
[12719.64 → 12719.86] Oh!
[12719.86 → 12720.86] Get him!
[12721.76 → 12722.04] Woo!
[12722.76 → 12723.98] Wait, February 5th?
[12724.04 → 12724.50] No way.
[12725.64 → 12726.86] Storm gate's coming out in two days?
[12727.16 → 12727.56] No.
[12727.96 → 12728.44] Is it really?
[12728.64 → 12729.94] Did this sneak up on me like that?
[12730.14 → 12730.38] Wait.
[12731.26 → 12731.96] It's the second.
[12732.08 → 12733.36] You live somewhere that isn't here.
[12733.52 → 12735.02] It might be early access or something.
[12735.18 → 12735.38] No.
[12735.46 → 12737.22] No exact release date's been confirmed yet.
[12737.22 → 12737.40] Yeah.
[12737.40 → 12739.90] It's a complex game, so it may take some time.
[12740.00 → 12740.80] Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[12740.92 → 12741.02] Yeah.
[12741.10 → 12741.52] No, no, no.
[12741.80 → 12743.60] Closed beta, apparently.
[12743.76 → 12743.96] Okay.
[12744.20 → 12744.54] All right.
[12744.58 → 12745.64] Well, I'm not in that, but.
[12745.88 → 12748.98] I mean, you're influential enough that I bet you could be.
[12749.42 → 12749.54] Yeah.
[12749.54 → 12750.80] Does anyone know anyone who works?
[12750.96 → 12751.50] Give me in there.
[12752.26 → 12753.20] Luke wants to play.
[12753.26 → 12754.74] I realistically won't have time, but.
[12754.90 → 12755.34] I do.
[12757.44 → 12759.20] And you have a new computer.
[12759.30 → 12759.92] Is it working now?
[12760.66 → 12761.02] Yeah.
[12761.30 → 12761.78] Okay, good.
[12761.78 → 12765.38] It works with the side panel off.
[12766.06 → 12766.56] All right.
[12766.56 → 12767.44] All right.
[12767.52 → 12770.00] We'll let the people watch the video.
[12770.10 → 12771.12] I've put it through some stuff, though.
[12771.22 → 12771.90] And like when it.
[12772.98 → 12774.74] I haven't recreated this scenario.
[12775.04 → 12775.18] Yeah.
[12775.26 → 12779.56] But when it did overheat that one time, I was pushing it very hard.
[12779.58 → 12781.40] But can you play Final Fantasy VI?
[12782.06 → 12782.80] I haven't tried yet.
[12782.86 → 12785.10] I am planning on playing tonight slash tomorrow.
[12785.24 → 12785.58] All right.
[12785.60 → 12785.84] Cool.
[12786.14 → 12788.58] I gave him my manual from when I was a kid.
[12788.60 → 12789.60] It's actually super cool.
[12789.68 → 12789.82] Yeah.
[12789.82 → 12790.52] Have you looked through it?
[12790.52 → 12791.66] Have you thumbed through it and stuff yet?
[12792.16 → 12794.54] Even before I was able to play, I was like, I'm going to look through this.
[12794.62 → 12796.20] Well, that's what it used to be like.
[12796.20 → 12796.94] I love stuff like that.
[12796.94 → 12798.92] Because your parents wouldn't let you play the game all the time.
[12798.98 → 12799.58] I also enjoy.
[12799.58 → 12801.14] And so you had to just read the manual.
[12801.86 → 12804.52] I enjoy tactile stuff in general.
[12804.70 → 12808.60] But like when we were playing Anna, which I would still like to play again sometime.
[12808.78 → 12808.94] Yeah.
[12809.04 → 12809.24] Yeah.
[12809.28 → 12811.58] We should go back to our world and like, you know, finish some stuff.
[12811.58 → 12812.62] We should go back to our world and figure out what the heck we were doing.
[12812.70 → 12812.90] Yeah.
[12813.30 → 12819.94] When we were playing Anna, I used to take written notes on a like notepad so that we could figure
[12819.94 → 12821.38] out what the heck we were supposed to do next time.
[12821.90 → 12824.24] Steam has since introduced a feature that I try to be.
[12824.24 → 12828.46] You told it to me through a video, actually.
[12828.74 → 12829.02] Nice.
[12829.12 → 12829.88] So I learned this from you.
[12830.32 → 12832.82] But it's like the coolest thing ever and no one seems to know about it.
[12833.16 → 12837.22] But Steam has a feature where if you bring up the overlay, you can have notes for a game
[12837.22 → 12842.54] that are cloud saved and game specific, which is like the coolest thing ever.
[12842.70 → 12842.82] Yeah.
[12842.82 → 12847.58] So I would have just digitized them if that feature existed back then.
[12847.68 → 12850.28] But oh, it's also an Play game.
[12850.78 → 12852.94] You can probably force Steam overlay onto it, but.
[12853.22 → 12853.62] Not sure.
[12853.96 → 12854.14] Yeah.
[12855.62 → 12856.10] Anyway.
[12856.36 → 12856.56] Yeah.
[12856.66 → 12857.10] Storm gate.
[12857.18 → 12857.80] That looks sick.
[12858.26 → 12865.44] I kind of hope that the future of games is actually aiming a little bit less high on
[12865.44 → 12867.24] the difficult, expensive things.
[12867.32 → 12868.08] Now tell me this.
[12868.10 → 12870.30] And still aiming really high on the fun.
[12870.30 → 12871.44] Now tell me this.
[12872.82 → 12880.48] What if that means these small teams have to use AI in order to achieve their goals?
[12880.48 → 12882.62] I don't even think I want to get into that conversation.
[12883.34 → 12884.28] This is dangerous.
[12884.78 → 12886.32] You're asking for...
[12886.32 → 12888.94] There are knives to my throat right now, man.
[12889.52 → 12893.98] The usage of AI, how much you should do, how much you can do, all that kind of stuff is
[12893.98 → 12896.94] very, very intriguing.
[12896.94 → 12898.84] I don't want either of you to touch that.
[12898.96 → 12901.10] Let's have another merch message.
[12901.10 → 12903.38] BlacksmokeRise says we are never going to bed.
[12903.56 → 12903.78] Lol.
[12904.84 → 12905.64] I have a sign.
[12905.64 → 12907.08] I think if we go down that path...
[12907.08 → 12907.30] I have a sign, chat.
[12907.40 → 12908.36] We have a sign for this.
[12908.42 → 12908.76] It's fine.
[12908.76 → 12910.86] Hi, DLL.
[12910.86 → 12915.48] I've worked for my high school's IT department for three years, but I'm going to study civil
[12915.48 → 12916.66] engineering in college.
[12916.96 → 12920.22] What is a good way to market tech skills to non-tech employers?
[12920.22 → 12923.62] I mean, I did this.
[12924.16 → 12926.86] I'm assuming you probably did to a certain degree as well back in the day.
[12926.94 → 12927.06] No?
[12927.26 → 12927.42] Nope.
[12927.42 → 12929.42] So I used to walk into...
[12932.06 → 12932.70] Most...
[12932.70 → 12936.72] I would try to profile places that I thought would need IT work.
[12937.00 → 12942.18] So I wouldn't necessarily walk into a grocery store.
[12942.36 → 12942.84] I don't know.
[12943.14 → 12943.72] That's just an example.
[12943.72 → 12944.02] Yeah, sure.
[12944.08 → 12944.58] No chain.
[12944.78 → 12945.30] Because it's...
[12945.30 → 12946.98] Yeah, especially no chain.
[12947.18 → 12952.92] What I would try to look for was small mom and pop, probably this is the only location
[12952.92 → 12955.80] that exists medical or legal practices.
[12956.54 → 12958.58] Because just off the top of my head with both of those...
[12960.20 → 12961.68] Tons of regulations around data retention.
[12961.68 → 12962.16] Tons of regulations.
[12962.58 → 12963.42] Data retention.
[12963.84 → 12965.04] Security for different things.
[12965.10 → 12965.22] Sure.
[12965.32 → 12968.26] That's when TrueCrypt was super sick back in the day.
[12968.56 → 12970.10] And nobody knew what TrueCrypt was.
[12970.26 → 12974.42] So I could basically just like get them set up with TrueCrypt and show them how to use it.
[12974.42 → 12976.70] And that would be like an automatic win.
[12977.02 → 12979.38] And I could often do that part for free.
[12979.46 → 12979.68] Yep.
[12980.20 → 12983.94] And then get my foot in the door and be like, all right, now that your data is encrypted
[12983.94 → 12987.68] so you're not breaking a bunch of laws, because you probably were, because most of them were,
[12987.76 → 12989.26] by the way, just so you know.
[12990.86 → 12992.84] I can do more things for you.
[12993.56 → 12994.62] You're going to have to pay me now.
[12994.86 → 12998.22] But I can set you up with, you know, like data redundancy.
[12998.70 → 12999.34] Remote access.
[12999.56 → 13000.16] Remote access.
[13000.28 → 13001.40] Do all these different types of things.
[13001.40 → 13005.84] Make it so that if this one computer dies, your entire company doesn't go up in flames.
[13006.28 → 13012.58] And you can give some cases of like, here's an example of a company where they had a fire.
[13013.24 → 13017.08] They lost all their records, and they just immediately went bankrupt because they're a
[13017.08 → 13018.62] legal or medical thing or whatever.
[13018.88 → 13020.50] And that like can't really happen.
[13022.32 → 13024.90] Huge risk in legal and medical field if you don't have good insurance, though.
[13025.18 → 13025.48] Yeah.
[13025.56 → 13026.74] I didn't know that back then.
[13027.12 → 13027.96] Let's move forward.
[13027.96 → 13029.92] But I think that is probably a thing.
[13031.04 → 13033.30] I think the insurance might be on the company.
[13033.52 → 13034.74] I don't know.
[13034.84 → 13035.38] There's some stuff.
[13035.38 → 13036.38] This is not legal advice.
[13036.56 → 13036.72] This is.
[13036.80 → 13038.12] Yeah, this is definitely not legal advice.
[13038.14 → 13039.98] Everything he's saying right now is the opposite of legal advice.
[13039.98 → 13040.62] Not even sort of.
[13040.70 → 13040.96] But yeah.
[13040.98 → 13042.12] It's beagle lice.
[13044.84 → 13052.54] Find a way to communicate how being more technologically advanced can financially benefit
[13052.54 → 13053.46] that business.
[13053.46 → 13055.92] The one bit I'll pitch in with is don't jargon them.
[13056.68 → 13058.44] Show them what they can do with it.
[13058.54 → 13059.06] Yeah, for real.
[13059.14 → 13059.78] Show them the result.
[13059.92 → 13060.98] Because there probably is.
[13061.02 → 13065.04] A lot of these companies, like they just don't know what is possible technologically.
[13065.38 → 13067.98] And they might be able to save a bunch of their own time.
[13068.32 → 13071.02] Maybe they're making enough money.
[13071.64 → 13074.36] This is the only storefront they want to have.
[13074.36 → 13076.96] But there's some tedium involved.
[13077.14 → 13081.12] And if you can help them skip that tedium, you might just make their life a bunch better.
[13081.40 → 13084.86] And if you can do that at a cost that is reasonable, they might run with it.
[13085.30 → 13086.42] All right, Dan, hit us.
[13088.02 → 13089.74] Hi, Dynast Duke and LAN.
[13090.04 → 13095.82] I work with superconducting magnets that will be used in the LHC at CERN.
[13095.88 → 13096.12] Oh!
[13096.28 → 13096.80] What a Chad.
[13097.00 → 13097.50] That's sick.
[13097.50 → 13100.40] What international project are you excited to see the outcome of?
[13100.54 → 13101.06] That one.
[13101.78 → 13102.10] Either.
[13102.10 → 13102.18] Either.
[13102.86 → 13104.56] How about garbage patch cleanup?
[13104.66 → 13105.36] I'm going to go with that.
[13105.74 → 13106.00] Yeah.
[13106.40 → 13107.64] There's actually really cool things there.
[13107.82 → 13108.06] Yeah.
[13108.14 → 13110.80] There's another really cool one that we became aware of recently.
[13111.22 → 13115.00] They're finding like old sunk ships.
[13115.42 → 13121.10] And they are mapping them and then going down and trying to retrieve the fuel from them.
[13122.48 → 13122.92] Yeah.
[13123.08 → 13123.80] No, that's cool.
[13123.86 → 13124.66] I've heard of that before.
[13124.66 → 13125.02] Yeah.
[13125.12 → 13130.30] Not because they like need fuel for ships, but because that way it won't leak out into the ocean.
[13130.48 → 13131.16] It's a bit of a time bomb.
[13131.28 → 13131.36] Yeah.
[13131.40 → 13131.62] Yeah.
[13132.10 → 13132.28] Yeah.
[13132.32 → 13133.06] That's really cool.
[13133.30 → 13135.30] I want to show this really quick before we keep going.
[13135.42 → 13140.50] I don't know if we showed this earlier, but apparently Storm gate, it's over 2 million was raised.
[13140.68 → 13140.78] Yeah.
[13140.84 → 13142.32] I know you said they beat their target.
[13142.90 → 13145.82] But like 2 million versus 100 grand is crazy.
[13145.86 → 13145.98] Yeah.
[13145.98 → 13150.64] People are storming the gates to get that game.
[13151.06 → 13151.56] Co-op?
[13152.84 → 13153.24] Yo.
[13154.06 → 13154.40] Yeah.
[13154.76 → 13156.02] I didn't know we had co-op.
[13156.02 → 13157.84] Make games that are games.
[13158.84 → 13160.02] Everybody copy this.
[13160.18 → 13160.78] It's good.
[13160.98 → 13161.56] Do this.
[13161.56 → 13162.26] Make it nice.
[13162.36 → 13163.56] That's so cool.
[13163.62 → 13164.58] Just do cool things.
[13164.70 → 13165.22] Just play it.
[13165.22 → 13165.78] It's a game.
[13165.86 → 13166.60] Just make it fun.
[13166.60 → 13168.38] No games have co-op.
[13168.68 → 13169.10] I know this.
[13169.70 → 13170.42] And it's awesome.
[13170.54 → 13171.46] And so does BG3.
[13171.84 → 13172.94] All these games that I love.
[13172.94 → 13177.56] If you have co-op in your game, and it's at least decently fun, I'm pretty much going to get it.
[13177.56 → 13178.38] Snapshot Rebound.
[13179.30 → 13179.74] Yeah.
[13179.92 → 13180.60] You know what's fun?
[13180.60 → 13180.98] It has co-op.
[13180.98 → 13182.80] Playing games with your friends.
[13182.96 → 13183.30] Yes.
[13183.52 → 13186.30] 5 v 5 or 6 v 6, I think it supports.
[13186.56 → 13188.46] Snapshot Rebound is...
[13188.46 → 13188.70] 8?
[13189.28 → 13189.58] Oh.
[13190.50 → 13192.50] Yeah, I think you have to go in the bigger arena, but I think you're right.
[13192.50 → 13194.04] Yeah, it's freaking nuts.
[13194.14 → 13194.72] Super fun.
[13194.82 → 13197.38] The potential to find five more friends, maybe.
[13197.56 → 13199.40] Don't care if it makes the game unbalanced.
[13199.68 → 13200.54] It doesn't matter.
[13200.80 → 13201.52] No one cares.
[13201.62 → 13202.92] I've heard that example from a bunch of people.
[13202.92 → 13207.08] Oh, we can't balance the single player campaign around co-op.
[13207.26 → 13207.50] Who cares?
[13207.56 → 13208.32] No one cares.
[13208.54 → 13212.92] You just team up and then your just Avengers stomp everything you encounter.
[13213.12 → 13213.96] And that's fun.
[13214.68 → 13215.20] Yeah.
[13215.40 → 13216.24] Just...
[13216.24 → 13217.28] Please.
[13217.62 → 13218.06] It's fun.
[13218.36 → 13219.04] Games are fun.
[13219.22 → 13220.72] Games are supposed to be fun.
[13221.82 → 13222.34] Anyway.
[13222.46 → 13223.58] Just make them fun.
[13223.58 → 13224.40] We'll move on from Storm gate.
[13224.50 → 13226.60] I'm wildly more excited now that I know it offers co-op.
[13226.60 → 13227.16] Yeah, that's sick.
[13227.70 → 13228.60] That's really cool.
[13228.96 → 13229.30] Hi, DLL.
[13229.30 → 13235.48] I know the lab and the Edmonton Court projects are huge, but what is the next step for LMG?
[13235.84 → 13237.94] Growth, enhancements, expansions?
[13238.06 → 13238.62] I love you guys.
[13238.62 → 13244.16] I think the main focus for us is getting the lab, improving the lab.
[13244.48 → 13249.24] I mean, it's obvious that we have things to work on.
[13249.34 → 13250.70] We've had things to work on.
[13250.70 → 13252.58] We have things to work on with that.
[13252.88 → 13256.30] I think that it's really clear where we want to get to.
[13256.30 → 13261.00] And there are a lot of investments and a lot of time that it's going to take in order to
[13261.00 → 13261.44] get there.
[13261.52 → 13265.78] But that's something that I think is probably the most important thing that we are doing
[13265.78 → 13272.58] right now, is building that database that will exist to help just demystify things and
[13272.58 → 13276.50] make this information that you can pull up at a moment's notice rather than something
[13276.50 → 13281.48] that you have to sit through a video that clearly none of you want to watch in order
[13281.48 → 13281.98] to get.
[13284.52 → 13290.38] With cities in the UK now increasing parking charges for EVs, with a reason given that
[13290.38 → 13295.84] they have higher lifetime emissions than traditional cars, are we starting to see the beginning
[13295.84 → 13297.18] of the end for EVs?
[13297.32 → 13297.54] No.
[13298.04 → 13298.98] What kind of question is that?
[13300.38 → 13301.98] EVs are not going anywhere.
[13302.36 → 13303.02] I mean...
[13303.02 → 13305.84] I do hope the plug-in hybrid model sort of takes over.
[13307.72 → 13308.24] Um...
[13308.24 → 13310.98] I think it is a better solution for the vast majority of people.
[13310.98 → 13313.20] With gasoline, I don't know that I'm that convinced.
[13313.42 → 13314.92] But, I mean...
[13314.92 → 13315.96] And I...
[13315.96 → 13316.42] With...
[13316.42 → 13317.42] With...
[13318.42 → 13324.30] I mean, hydrogen fuel cell, if it works as well as it, like, pie in the sky should, it
[13324.30 → 13325.74] kind of sounds amazing.
[13327.80 → 13328.32] Um...
[13328.32 → 13330.12] I still feel like...
[13330.12 → 13333.00] I don't know enough about hydrogen fuel cells to talk about this, to be completely honest.
[13333.26 → 13333.94] Yeah, I know...
[13333.94 → 13337.86] I know enough to know that it's, on paper, just outstanding.
[13338.02 → 13340.06] Because the refuelling times are more like gas.
[13340.32 → 13340.48] Yeah.
[13340.54 → 13342.14] And the emissions are more like nothing.
[13343.14 → 13344.34] It's super cool.
[13344.48 → 13345.90] Isn't it absurdly expensive, though?
[13346.40 → 13346.66] Yeah.
[13347.10 → 13347.58] But it's...
[13347.58 → 13348.26] It's a long way...
[13348.26 → 13349.76] It's a long way away is the biggest issue.
[13350.10 → 13350.34] Yeah.
[13352.84 → 13354.34] Hey, double...
[13354.34 → 13356.28] Hey, D-double hockey sticks.
[13356.58 → 13358.30] Have you ever realized, at the moment...
[13358.30 → 13358.80] What's going on?
[13358.80 → 13359.22] I don't know.
[13359.42 → 13359.98] They're just...
[13359.98 → 13361.00] They're going crazy with the names.
[13361.48 → 13362.12] All of them.
[13362.12 → 13363.12] All of them are like this.
[13363.20 → 13364.90] Every single message is like this.
[13365.22 → 13366.38] Hey, D-double hockey sticks.
[13366.46 → 13369.64] Have you ever realized, at the moment, that you're doing something you'd remember for
[13369.64 → 13370.48] the rest of your life?
[13370.66 → 13370.86] Yes.
[13370.94 → 13371.30] What was it?
[13372.12 → 13372.64] Uh...
[13372.64 → 13373.76] I'm not going to repeat most of them.
[13373.90 → 13375.04] But I think it's...
[13375.04 → 13377.04] I think it's...
[13377.04 → 13378.42] We have a bleep button, Luke.
[13378.42 → 13380.64] I think it's an important thing to do, actually.
[13380.86 → 13381.84] Not only in the moment of...
[13381.84 → 13383.50] What, the thing you were doing that you can't say?
[13383.64 → 13386.16] I mean, sure, how else do we make more people?
[13386.30 → 13386.56] But...
[13386.56 → 13388.48] It's truly a noble goal.
[13388.52 → 13392.82] I was thinking more like trash bags and a large carpet and then like a ditch.
[13393.06 → 13393.34] Yeah.
[13393.56 → 13394.02] Yeah, yeah.
[13394.08 → 13394.42] Maybe that, too.
[13394.42 → 13396.04] You know if you're using a condom, it's all for nothing.
[13399.76 → 13401.56] Yeah, Linus knows how to replace rubbers now.
[13401.56 → 13403.26] No percentage chance that it's for something.
[13405.90 → 13406.86] He's not wrong.
[13408.72 → 13414.50] Anyway, I think it's actually very important and valuable to you as a person.
[13414.78 → 13419.68] To not necessarily even when you're in the exact moment, but when you're in a period of time.
[13420.46 → 13426.98] When you're like, recognizing I will at some point in time look back at this and think of this as good old days
[13426.98 → 13429.82] for whatever this activity type of thing is.
[13429.82 → 13434.80] I think it's actually good to recognize that and like bask in the warmth of that to a certain degree.
[13435.88 → 13442.28] Because if you don't, I think it's easy to fall into negativity even though you are in a very good time
[13442.28 → 13444.74] because you're only thinking about the bad things.
[13445.28 → 13448.70] And allowing yourself to just like actually be like, no, you know what?
[13448.72 → 13450.34] In a lot of ways, this is really great.
[13451.32 → 13455.32] And I'm going to be very happy thinking about this in the future is a good thing.
[13455.66 → 13457.20] There's too much negativity in the world.
[13457.68 → 13458.82] I don't take enough candid pictures.
[13458.82 → 13459.84] Me neither.
[13460.22 → 13462.88] Like this moment.
[13464.38 → 13466.14] Why would I take a picture of this?
[13466.20 → 13471.54] It's just, it's just, we're walking to or from school or something.
[13471.66 → 13474.16] It's just Yvonne and our youngest daughter.
[13474.16 → 13480.10] She's carrying her for, you know, what might be the last time?
[13480.56 → 13481.12] Yeah.
[13481.12 → 13481.72] Right?
[13481.82 → 13487.30] Like she's getting to the age where you don't know when the last time you carry them somewhere is going to be.
[13487.44 → 13487.60] Right?
[13488.18 → 13490.86] And so I'm trying to think about that stuff more.
[13490.94 → 13493.12] But honestly, I'm terrible about it.
[13493.12 → 13498.98] I, um, we took some pictures when we were at the badminton centre.
[13498.98 → 13505.80] Cause like, I realized that we took no pictures of our Renault when I was trying to pull a cable through conduit.
[13505.80 → 13508.74] And I was like, yeah, I have no in progress of this.
[13508.74 → 13512.80] And the most fun pictures for me to look back at are always the candid ones.
[13513.12 → 13516.62] Just like, oh yeah, we had the furniture like that in that room.
[13517.24 → 13519.66] That means more to me.
[13519.66 → 13521.78] I try to screenshot float plane every once in a while.
[13521.78 → 13522.06] Yeah.
[13522.18 → 13526.40] I, I, I tried to, I have a bunch of historical screenshots of the forum.
[13526.94 → 13527.46] Different things like that.
[13527.46 → 13529.24] Things change more than we realize, I think.
[13529.36 → 13529.64] Yes.
[13529.78 → 13533.16] I sent the ones I took, uh, to Yvonne because.
[13533.26 → 13533.46] Nice.
[13533.50 → 13533.66] Yeah.
[13533.80 → 13535.22] I took a bunch of reference pictures.
[13535.34 → 13535.72] Thank you.
[13535.96 → 13536.40] You're welcome.
[13536.56 → 13536.70] Yeah.
[13537.70 → 13542.56] Dan just, what I was laughing at, by the way, was Dan just like slid out from behind and took a photo of us.
[13542.88 → 13544.10] I thought that would be cute.
[13544.64 → 13545.30] That is funny.
[13545.52 → 13546.54] Dan, you're always cute.
[13546.54 → 13550.22] Feeling cute right now might delete later.
[13551.14 → 13553.00] My screen protector goes over the front of it.
[13553.04 → 13554.54] So it's blurry as hell, but that'll be fun.
[13554.76 → 13554.94] Yeah.
[13556.38 → 13557.20] I don't know.
[13557.28 → 13559.56] I actually genuinely think it's very important.
[13559.94 → 13564.36] Um, I don't think I've done that enough in my life, but it's something I've tried to make an effort to do more.
[13564.44 → 13566.78] So over the last, I'd probably say like three or four years.
[13567.46 → 13571.50] Um, and there's been a few times when I've even like said it out loud to other people, and they're like, what do you mean?
[13572.40 → 13573.10] I'm like, I don't know.
[13573.14 → 13575.20] I feel like we're kind of at a peak with this thing.
[13575.20 → 13583.62] Not that that's a bad thing, but I think we should like to appreciate that and enjoy it while we have whatever this is.
[13583.68 → 13591.94] And that might be a friend group that like, if you have a friend group in high school, even if you stay friends with them after high school, it's different.
[13592.14 → 13594.12] You're probably not going to see them very often.
[13594.42 → 13594.54] Yeah.
[13594.58 → 13595.76] Someone might move away.
[13595.88 → 13597.14] It's not going to be the same.
[13597.14 → 13602.60] Someone might be that low percentage, even when they do use the thing that they have kids then.
[13602.98 → 13603.16] Yep.
[13603.42 → 13603.66] Yep.
[13603.88 → 13606.52] Uh, you, you might have like a D and D group that you play with.
[13606.94 → 13610.88] Eventually that's probably going to end, not guaranteed, but probably.
[13610.88 → 13613.96] And you should just recognize when you're at the moment, like this is fun.
[13614.12 → 13615.14] I like these people.
[13615.22 → 13615.68] This is good.
[13615.74 → 13617.04] This is a good thing that I have.
[13617.80 → 13618.82] I, this is, yeah.
[13619.54 → 13620.04] I don't know.
[13620.10 → 13621.06] I'm going to stop ranting about it.
[13621.52 → 13624.88] Uh, speaking of things that, um, I'm making memories of.
[13624.88 → 13630.54] Remember last week I was trying to point out bannable comments and I realized I hadn't really
[13630.54 → 13631.58] screenshotted any of them.
[13631.62 → 13633.40] Well, I screenshotted some for the show this week.
[13633.40 → 13636.66] Uh, here's an example of a comment that will get you a shadow-ban.
[13637.78 → 13642.42] I wonder how mocking the blatantly failing commercial name strategy of India every
[13642.42 → 13646.84] 30 seconds helps in any way the consumers understand what to choose.
[13647.36 → 13652.14] Naming choices start sucking more than hell at 4000 series launch and launch not grown
[13652.14 → 13652.44] better.
[13652.90 → 13655.22] However, LMG says we're pro consumers.
[13655.64 → 13656.66] Okay, fine.
[13657.04 → 13658.26] Deliver info.
[13658.82 → 13661.80] Stand-up comedian should be for super fun channel is.
[13663.40 → 13664.52] Shadow.
[13664.98 → 13666.44] What are you even talking about?
[13666.64 → 13667.24] Yeah, I don't know.
[13667.28 → 13668.98] Like what, actually, what are you talking about?
[13669.08 → 13669.56] I have no idea.
[13671.24 → 13673.86] Um, yeah, so this one's good.
[13673.92 → 13675.92] This is from the Land Centre badminton video.
[13676.86 → 13682.52] At 516, I make a comment about how the women's washroom has the natural light because of course
[13682.52 → 13683.92] the women's washrooms are always nicer.
[13685.04 → 13686.96] What a completely unnecessary comment.
[13686.96 → 13691.12] Like if you're so bothered by women having the changing room with nature lighting, change
[13691.12 → 13691.30] it.
[13691.58 → 13692.38] You own the company.
[13692.38 → 13695.10] This is so toxic and not even true to be honest.
[13697.04 → 13697.52] What?
[13698.34 → 13698.82] Shadowban.
[13699.04 → 13699.34] Nice.
[13699.44 → 13700.28] You're actually done.
[13700.38 → 13701.34] You have nothing to contribute.
[13701.44 → 13705.40] I've just, I've seen some questions from people like, okay, is Linus just like silencing
[13705.40 → 13706.34] dissenting opinions?
[13707.22 → 13711.76] No, it's just like actual wastes of characters on YouTube servers.
[13711.76 → 13715.76] Like what do you, it's a it's like, it's a thing.
[13715.86 → 13720.34] You know, the women's washroom is always nicer and cleaner and smells better because it just
[13720.34 → 13722.02] does because they just take care of things.
[13722.56 → 13724.38] Like it's just, it's just a thing.
[13724.38 → 13728.40] And the natural, obviously I know I could change it.
[13728.40 → 13732.48] The decision was made that the women's washroom should just be nicer because they're just always
[13732.48 → 13732.90] nicer.
[13733.40 → 13738.40] I thought about shadow-bans for the people who talked about the privacy issue of having
[13738.40 → 13739.04] a window there.
[13739.16 → 13742.72] I considered it because obviously we're not stupid.
[13742.72 → 13744.62] We're going to put security film on it.
[13744.66 → 13744.88] Like what?
[13745.68 → 13747.98] Come on, come on people.
[13747.98 → 13749.60] But I decided to leave those.
[13749.94 → 13751.48] I decided to leave those.
[13752.32 → 13759.64] Anyway, bit by bit, I'm cleaning up our comment section, and I'm actually noticing a difference.
[13760.14 → 13760.24] Yeah.
[13760.40 → 13760.58] Good.
[13760.70 → 13767.34] It is a shockingly small number of users contributing to the vast majority of the stupidity in the
[13767.34 → 13767.96] comment section.
[13768.02 → 13769.36] Like a decade ago or something.
[13769.40 → 13770.78] I used to be against that type of stuff.
[13770.78 → 13773.28] But I think in the modern web, you just have to.
[13774.92 → 13775.28] Yeah.
[13775.52 → 13776.02] I don't think there's a choice.
[13776.02 → 13776.84] I think it just is what it is.
[13776.84 → 13783.38] And I think honestly, an argument to the other side is just an argument asking for a bad
[13783.38 → 13783.98] experience.
[13784.94 → 13786.18] I, yeah, I don't know.
[13786.28 → 13787.90] How do you know the women's washroom is better?
[13788.06 → 13788.24] Hmm.
[13788.76 → 13789.16] Su's.
[13790.14 → 13791.98] Says as early 32.
[13792.82 → 13800.56] One of the most mortifying experiences of my adult life was in the library at UBC.
[13800.78 → 13801.92] In university.
[13802.72 → 13806.32] When I just went to the washroom.
[13808.18 → 13809.40] Used the bathroom.
[13811.70 → 13814.46] Came out to wash my hands.
[13815.04 → 13817.92] And there was a woman washing her hands at the sink next to me.
[13817.92 → 13826.86] And I just left without washing my hands, which probably didn't make it better at that point.
[13828.20 → 13829.94] I just hadn't paid attention.
[13830.10 → 13830.34] I just.
[13830.44 → 13831.12] Need to get out.
[13831.28 → 13833.14] I just walked into the women's washroom.
[13833.68 → 13834.00] Um.
[13835.28 → 13836.56] It was pretty bad.
[13836.90 → 13839.24] I've, I've almost, but never actually done it.
[13839.30 → 13842.90] I've like gotten up to right in front of the door and then be like, oh, and then switched.
[13842.90 → 13843.18] Yeah.
[13843.18 → 13843.74] I've never.
[13844.10 → 13844.36] Yeah.
[13844.74 → 13844.98] Yeah.
[13845.00 → 13847.34] No, I, I like went in, did my business.
[13847.48 → 13848.98] It wasn't, it wasn't a busy library.
[13848.98 → 13850.76] It was like the it was like the small one.
[13850.78 → 13853.96] It was, uh, which one was it?
[13854.30 → 13855.90] Yvonne and I used to go hang.
[13855.94 → 13856.16] Oh yeah.
[13856.20 → 13856.98] And Yvonne was there.
[13856.98 → 13863.20] Like I, I, I, I left and came back, and I was like completely red.
[13863.20 → 13869.48] And so I told her immediately like, uh, okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I just checked
[13869.48 → 13870.52] out the women's washroom.
[13870.68 → 13871.46] Hey, nice washroom.
[13873.96 → 13875.06] You guys are doing great.
[13875.90 → 13876.34] Yeah.
[13876.80 → 13878.44] It wasn't a labelling issue.
[13878.78 → 13882.42] I just completely spaced 100%.
[13882.42 → 13885.84] Um, I have to redeem myself at super checks.
[13885.84 → 13888.58] So we do have to start getting through some of these merch messages at some point.
[13889.02 → 13891.58] Luke beat me last week, and I'm so upset.
[13891.70 → 13892.10] Got them.
[13892.58 → 13895.62] Overtime game five of our five game series.
[13895.76 → 13896.60] They're perfect games.
[13897.02 → 13900.04] They were really tight games, hard fought games.
[13900.52 → 13900.62] What?
[13900.72 → 13904.96] Did I win the first two or was it one, one, one, one, one.
[13905.58 → 13909.70] I think it was, I think you did win the first two and then I came back.
[13909.72 → 13909.78] Yeah.
[13909.84 → 13911.66] And he came back and took three in a row.
[13911.76 → 13912.04] Yeah.
[13912.90 → 13913.48] F***ING God.
[13913.48 → 13916.06] So, cause the first game was like really close or something.
[13916.14 → 13918.50] And then the second game was, I don't think it was.
[13919.36 → 13919.76] Yeah.
[13919.76 → 13920.66] And then I came back.
[13920.78 → 13921.80] I think, I don't remember.
[13922.10 → 13922.46] Anyway.
[13922.64 → 13922.80] Yeah.
[13924.66 → 13925.06] Yeah.
[13925.06 → 13926.50] I should've noticed there was no urinal though.
[13929.36 → 13929.76] Yeah.
[13929.76 → 13935.18] People say that, but I don't know if you're, if you're spaced enough, if you're, if your head
[13935.18 → 13938.36] somewhere else thinking about somewhere else that you walked into there in the first place,
[13938.36 → 13940.04] are you going to notice the urinal thing?
[13940.12 → 13940.48] I don't know.
[13942.18 → 13942.54] Yeah.
[13945.10 → 13945.68] All right.
[13945.74 → 13947.14] Let's see what else we got here.
[13947.52 → 13948.12] Hello, DLL.
[13948.38 → 13952.74] With the land centre coming soon, will we be able to buy LTT merch and other cool stuff
[13952.74 → 13954.00] from the creator warehouse there?
[13954.24 → 13955.20] Thanks for the cool tools.
[13955.74 → 13957.36] Uh, there'll be some stuff there.
[13957.36 → 13961.44] Like I would imagine we'd have water bottles and stuff probably, but it's.
[13961.44 → 13964.86] Might as well have at least like a couple of screwdrivers and backpacks.
[13965.38 → 13965.78] Screwdrivers?
[13965.90 → 13967.40] And I don't want it to seem weird.
[13967.40 → 13968.68] Like it's a badminton pro shop.
[13968.74 → 13970.12] It's not a screwdriver store.
[13970.82 → 13971.60] That makes sense.
[13971.68 → 13975.54] We do want to do a physical location at some point, but like, I also don't want it to just
[13975.54 → 13978.42] look like a weird LTT garage sale, you know?
[13978.62 → 13978.80] Yeah.
[13978.80 → 13979.24] It makes sense.
[13979.80 → 13986.60] Um, like I could see like we, LTT has, uh, like, uh, like athletic pants and stuff.
[13986.60 → 13990.96] Like we, we would totally have those there, but beyond that, no, I don't think so.
[13992.28 → 13998.30] Hey, LLD, what are your thoughts on the Apple air tags now that they notify a thief they're
[13998.30 → 13998.92] being tracked?
[13999.06 → 14004.12] Had my LTT backpack stolen last year with one in it and never got my stuff back.
[14004.44 → 14012.66] So I only found out this week that as an Android user, you can ping any air tag that has been
[14012.66 → 14016.18] like near your phone recently or something like that.
[14016.18 → 14017.78] So Yvonne discovered this.
[14017.92 → 14022.10] She was like, yeah, I had to use my, because I, I threw an air tag in her purse because
[14022.10 → 14026.28] she went through a period a little while there where she was just like leaving it everywhere.
[14026.28 → 14030.46] And I was like, okay, well, this is getting really inconvenient trying to track down where
[14030.46 → 14032.72] you put it on the security cameras and stuff.
[14033.28 → 14037.74] Um, like she's usually perfect about that stuff, but we just, she wasn't getting a lot
[14037.74 → 14038.14] of sleep.
[14038.14 → 14041.82] And she just kind of like, she left it somewhere like twice within a few weeks or something
[14041.82 → 14042.22] like that.
[14042.26 → 14043.68] And I was like, okay, this needs to stop happening.
[14044.02 → 14048.06] So I threw an air tag that I happened to have caused brand someone over for some sponsored
[14048.06 → 14048.38] something.
[14048.44 → 14050.42] It had a Linus mean face on it, checked it in her purse.
[14050.42 → 14054.06] And I was like, okay, well just let me know if you need to find it because, and I'll have
[14054.06 → 14055.30] to grab the utility iPhone.
[14055.30 → 14057.02] Cause neither of us daily drives an iPhone.
[14058.36 → 14063.34] And then this was, I don't know, six months ago or something, but earlier this week she
[14063.34 → 14065.66] goes, oh yeah, I had to use the air tag for the first time.
[14065.66 → 14066.78] I'm like, what do you mean use the air tag?
[14066.80 → 14067.40] How'd you use it?
[14067.40 → 14069.26] I don't even think you know where my iPhone is.
[14069.26 → 14074.20] And she's like, oh yeah, no, I just go into this thing, and you can see recently connected
[14074.20 → 14076.36] trackers and just beep them.
[14076.48 → 14083.44] Like you obviously can't use, um, UW, whatever it is, the like the super, super direct UWB.
[14083.54 → 14084.46] I forget what it's called.
[14084.96 → 14089.28] Uh, but you can't, you know, just point it and find it, you know, to within 30 centimetres
[14089.28 → 14091.48] or whatever, but you can, you can ping it.
[14091.92 → 14093.14] And I was like, oh, okay.
[14093.22 → 14093.58] Interesting.
[14093.76 → 14097.76] So it seems like over time, Apple has gone from sending an occasional notification to you
[14097.76 → 14099.36] can actually like to ping the thing.
[14100.02 → 14105.98] Um, what I will say is this is true to the intended functionality of the device.
[14106.22 → 14109.62] It was supposed to be for you to find your own thing that you misplaced.
[14109.82 → 14112.64] It was really useful for anti-theft.
[14113.40 → 14118.72] Um, I don't want it to be used for stalking and stuff though, but I understand why these
[14118.72 → 14120.60] changes have been made.
[14120.92 → 14121.16] Yeah.
[14121.16 → 14127.64] Um, yeah, man, I, I get it.
[14127.64 → 14131.30] I understand why they had to change it, but for the law-abiding citizens, it's, this is
[14131.30 → 14133.78] one of those things where they never do wells wreck things for everyone.
[14133.78 → 14137.44] If just, if nobody used them for stalking, this wouldn't be a problem.
[14137.54 → 14141.12] And you could just track your personal air tag anywhere you wanted, anytime you wanted.
[14141.28 → 14143.26] And it sucks that it has to be like this.
[14143.30 → 14143.42] Yeah.
[14143.44 → 14144.76] This is why we can't have nice things.
[14144.86 → 14145.66] De Martinis.
[14147.28 → 14148.52] On that same subject.
[14148.52 → 14149.44] That's a great segue.
[14149.82 → 14150.56] Um, I love this.
[14150.60 → 14153.04] This is a great take on, um, a comment.
[14153.04 → 14153.56] And I get a lot.
[14153.98 → 14158.04] Hey Linus, I've been watching since elementary school when you didn't even have your own
[14158.04 → 14158.54] channel yet.
[14158.76 → 14161.90] And was always wanting to ask you why you're built funny.
[14162.94 → 14164.16] It's just a very strange.
[14164.94 → 14166.14] Why I'm built funny.
[14166.38 → 14167.54] Like, do you mean physically?
[14167.72 → 14168.56] Like my build?
[14169.58 → 14171.70] If you'd be taking it so long, so many ways.
[14171.92 → 14173.32] Linus, I live in your walls.
[14173.52 → 14174.48] Why are you so weird?
[14174.48 → 14182.06] I often make that joke when people walk up to me at a trade show or expo or whatever,
[14182.26 → 14184.50] or they're like, I've been watching you for 10 years.
[14184.52 → 14185.90] And I'm like, really?
[14185.96 → 14186.70] I didn't see you.
[14187.62 → 14188.26] It's great.
[14188.50 → 14188.92] That's horrible.
[14188.94 → 14189.70] Have fun with it.
[14189.84 → 14190.10] I know.
[14190.16 → 14190.52] I love it.
[14190.96 → 14191.04] Sheesh.
[14191.26 → 14192.90] It's, it's, yeah, this is great.
[14193.46 → 14194.84] Uh, built funny.
[14195.10 → 14199.64] Um, I have kind of wide hips for a, for a male, for my, for my body type.
[14199.72 → 14200.92] The fashion team tells me that.
[14200.92 → 14205.06] Um, robust child birthing hips.
[14205.50 → 14206.12] It's good.
[14206.22 → 14209.80] Other than that, uh, you know, I'm kind of short, but it's all in my legs.
[14209.82 → 14210.84] My torso is normal.
[14210.84 → 14216.36] So if I wanted to get that like height enhancing, uh, surgery, I would actually look quite proportionally
[14216.36 → 14216.78] sound.
[14216.90 → 14217.16] Okay.
[14217.24 → 14218.22] I can't play sports anymore.
[14218.76 → 14219.20] At all.
[14219.52 → 14224.12] Well, like I'm sure you at all could do something, but they definitely say like,
[14224.18 → 14227.64] is it because the bone structure is not as strong or like, what's the reason?
[14227.64 → 14231.38] Uh, I would assume that it is not as strong as it used to be.
[14231.48 → 14234.72] And probably it messes up your muscles a little bit, but yeah, I don't know if you guys know
[14234.72 → 14236.30] this, but you can recover from both of those.
[14236.46 → 14241.72] If you're short, you can like to have your legs broken, and then they like to pull your bones apart
[14241.72 → 14244.72] and they brace them, and they like to grow back together or something.
[14244.80 → 14247.18] It's, it's, it's wild surgery.
[14247.54 → 14247.74] It's kind of nuts.
[14247.90 → 14251.00] You, uh, you won't be able to play sports because you would be too powerful.
[14252.02 → 14254.22] Here's one for Luke while you go through some of the potentials.
[14254.22 → 14255.46] Uh, what is your favourite?
[14255.46 → 14256.44] You'll have to throw me.
[14258.74 → 14261.50] Oh my goodness.
[14265.00 → 14267.62] Luke, what is your favourite build in Slay the Spire?
[14267.82 → 14271.94] I always love when a shiv deck can come together with the silent.
[14272.76 → 14273.90] Uh, that's kind of funny.
[14273.98 → 14276.66] That's one of my favourite builds in Slay the Spire.
[14276.98 → 14280.84] Uh, all my favourite builds are going to be not all.
[14280.84 → 14283.02] The majority of my favourite builds are on the silent.
[14283.12 → 14285.00] The silent's my favourite one by far.
[14285.40 → 14292.26] Um, I would probably say that honestly I prefer poison to shiv, but shiv is fantastic.
[14292.92 → 14294.48] Um, they're both very, very good.
[14294.96 → 14296.68] Um, I find both of those very fun.
[14297.00 → 14302.30] Another one that I like is just raging super hard on ironclad and going full strength and
[14302.30 → 14305.58] just trying to like one to two turn every single combat.
[14305.78 → 14306.82] And if you fail, you die.
[14307.22 → 14308.52] That's very entertaining.
[14308.76 → 14309.94] Uh, so those are my three favourite.
[14309.94 → 14310.92] Um, glass cannon.
[14311.24 → 14312.56] I think that type of thing is called.
[14312.76 → 14312.86] Yeah.
[14313.00 → 14313.22] Yeah.
[14313.40 → 14316.54] Because he's often built as like a, a, a block machine.
[14316.54 → 14318.60] So he just like defends like crazy.
[14318.72 → 14322.32] So you just build them in completely other way, which he is also built for, but a lot
[14322.32 → 14324.00] of new players won't go for it.
[14324.20 → 14325.58] You just go strength super hard.
[14326.02 → 14327.00] Um, yeah.
[14327.58 → 14328.56] Hey DLL.
[14328.76 → 14334.98] I remember an old LTT video about haunted hardware, which had fraps working on Vulcan when
[14334.98 → 14335.90] it shouldn't have been.
[14336.10 → 14339.36] Aside from that, what's the weirdest hardware thing you've seen?
[14339.36 → 14343.18] Uh, recently I wasn't able to play back video on my machine at home.
[14343.24 → 14348.08] It turned out to be, uh, I needed to reinstall my AMD drivers, but even with hardware acceleration
[14348.08 → 14349.82] disabled, it would barely play anything.
[14349.92 → 14351.04] It was super weird.
[14351.08 → 14352.74] I wish I, I wish I'd recorded it.
[14353.08 → 14356.08] Because it's the kind of thing where you tell people they're like, oh yeah, but I'm sure
[14356.08 → 14356.74] it was easily solved.
[14356.74 → 14358.16] No, it was not easily solvable.
[14358.30 → 14358.58] Everything.
[14358.72 → 14361.08] YouTube, Twitch, uh, local media players.
[14361.26 → 14363.10] I just couldn't really, I couldn't play media.
[14363.46 → 14363.64] Yeah.
[14363.90 → 14365.72] Um, I mean, I don't know.
[14365.74 → 14366.20] I've seen some weird.
[14366.28 → 14368.82] Oh, oh, my, uh, my old boot drive for my system.
[14368.82 → 14370.92] One of the reasons that I was like, okay, just it.
[14371.00 → 14371.58] Let's reformat.
[14371.58 → 14375.88] This thing was that, um, windows hello will not work.
[14375.98 → 14377.76] I cannot change my password.
[14377.96 → 14380.14] It's, it's just like, it's just, it's just broken.
[14380.26 → 14384.86] I have a, I have a webcam that supports it and on the fresh install, it just immediately
[14384.86 → 14386.00] works the way it's supposed to.
[14386.06 → 14389.94] But there was some weird authentication thing where I was using a local account and then
[14389.94 → 14393.42] I was using like a work account, and then I was using my Hotmail, and then I was just
[14393.42 → 14394.00] something, something.
[14394.00 → 14396.56] It's just, it has no idea what's going on.
[14396.62 → 14397.48] It's completely broken.
[14399.90 → 14406.50] Um, I, I think my most modern example at the very least is when we used to do remote calls
[14406.50 → 14407.80] for the WAN show.
[14408.16 → 14413.28] Um, we used to, I'm talking like within the last, the, the most recent one that isn't
[14413.28 → 14414.14] the current one we're using.
[14414.26 → 14419.26] Uh, we used a system called ping.GG from, from Theo, which was great.
[14419.64 → 14422.78] Um, he said.
[14422.78 → 14425.80] I think afterwards, I don't remember.
[14426.38 → 14427.94] I know he said it afterwards.
[14428.06 → 14431.00] I think he might've said it beforehand as well that it doesn't work on mobile.
[14431.48 → 14436.68] Um, but when I was in that airport in Serbia and I had to call in for the WAN show, I did
[14436.68 → 14440.90] it entirely through my phone on mobile, and it worked flawlessly the whole time.
[14440.92 → 14446.34] And I remember I told him afterwards, and he was like, that shouldn't have worked, but
[14446.34 → 14448.08] yeah, it was, it was flawless.
[14448.24 → 14449.66] So that was kind of fun.
[14450.34 → 14452.40] It was also really important that it worked at that time.
[14452.40 → 14454.12] So I'm happy that it did.
[14456.92 → 14457.72] Oh no.
[14458.02 → 14458.60] Uh, oh yeah.
[14458.72 → 14461.38] What's your favourite Jacky cooling video on the channel?
[14461.56 → 14462.88] One of my favourite series.
[14467.08 → 14468.40] Favourite Jacky cooling.
[14468.40 → 14471.62] This one holds a very special place in my heart.
[14472.18 → 14476.40] I don't know why actually, because there are other ones that were more fun.
[14476.62 → 14479.26] There were other ones that were more visually interesting.
[14479.26 → 14485.04] Like when we used water to cool a heat sink, uh, like we, we used, put an air cooler and
[14485.04 → 14486.56] we just poured water through it.
[14486.56 → 14488.86] Or like the fire cooling that hack smith came out.
[14488.90 → 14493.06] Like we've done so many Jacky cooling things, put the computer in the fridge, which obviously
[14493.06 → 14494.86] didn't work because obviously that won't work.
[14495.22 → 14500.66] Uh, but I don't know why, but this, when you ask that question, this is the one that stuck
[14500.66 → 14501.58] out in my mind.
[14502.16 → 14507.56] Baby Alex building the world's shittiest mould.
[14507.56 → 14510.38] Oh my.
[14511.12 → 14511.96] Hold on, hold on.
[14511.98 → 14512.94] Those are the failed attempts.
[14513.12 → 14513.80] Just a second.
[14517.34 → 14518.10] Oh my God.
[14518.16 → 14519.34] I have not seen this video.
[14520.16 → 14521.02] Holy crap.
[14521.54 → 14524.24] I remember this, but it's so old.
[14524.38 → 14525.36] So this is it.
[14525.42 → 14531.56] In order to get it mounted to anything, uh, we basically had to just cut the one.
[14531.56 → 14532.56] Oh my.
[14534.16 → 14535.40] I love this.
[14535.44 → 14536.30] This is it mounted.
[14536.30 → 14537.76] Cool the CPU with a brick.
[14537.76 → 14538.58] This channel seems cool.
[14538.66 → 14539.44] I should subscribe.
[14539.76 → 14542.76] Um, yeah, it didn't work at all.
[14542.84 → 14543.28] Pretty much.
[14543.30 → 14544.58] It's a complete piece of shift.
[14544.80 → 14548.04] I think Alex still has this next to his desk.
[14548.18 → 14549.38] I would keep that forever.
[14549.66 → 14550.20] Why wouldn't you?
[14550.20 → 14550.46] Yeah.
[14550.82 → 14551.00] Yeah.
[14551.04 → 14551.64] That's beautiful.
[14551.88 → 14552.30] Amazing.
[14552.84 → 14553.64] Memories, man.
[14553.72 → 14554.10] No worries.
[14554.10 → 14554.28] I love that.
[14558.90 → 14564.62] Uh, I ran into a lot of issues at my company around poor communication as someone who is
[14564.62 → 14565.12] Do you work here?
[14565.12 → 14566.70] Do you work anywhere?
[14567.98 → 14568.38] Yeah.
[14568.66 → 14572.20] As someone who is leading a team, are there any ways you have found to combat this?
[14572.30 → 14574.86] The roles here are all work from home as well.
[14575.22 → 14575.94] Oh God.
[14576.00 → 14577.70] Please, please email us if you know.
[14578.98 → 14581.08] If you find out, save us.
[14581.26 → 14584.80] If I knew the answer, I'd be writing a book and I wouldn't have to work here anymore.
[14584.80 → 14585.14] Yeah.
[14585.14 → 14587.88] If you find out, sell it to the world and become a billionaire.
[14588.72 → 14591.28] So I think the answer is no.
[14591.50 → 14597.02] Communicating with a large group of very different people is extremely hard.
[14597.18 → 14602.58] How people take a certain message is going to be very different depending on whom the person
[14602.58 → 14604.62] is when they receive it, all that type of stuff.
[14604.92 → 14611.50] Also, some people will just not be very interested in reading messages from certain messaging apps.
[14611.82 → 14615.84] So there might be people that prefer to read messages from something or another thing or
[14615.84 → 14620.98] someone who ignores one type of routine email maybe that you put information in,
[14620.98 → 14622.90] but they just don't think it's normally very important to them.
[14622.96 → 14626.14] So they don't read it moving forward, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[14626.36 → 14629.74] Fun fact, on our Monday morning meeting notes, the first line is actually,
[14629.94 → 14630.96] Monday morning meeting is important.
[14631.08 → 14632.58] You need to read it or something like that.
[14632.62 → 14633.18] And I'm sure.
[14633.32 → 14634.54] I don't remember the wording because.
[14635.44 → 14636.46] He doesn't read it.
[14636.60 → 14639.06] Because I can't see it anymore because it's always there.
[14639.14 → 14640.90] There's no work around for that.
[14641.18 → 14641.38] Yeah.
[14641.68 → 14643.08] So like, I don't know, man.
[14643.42 → 14646.28] It's a big problem.
[14646.28 → 14652.68] And I think being too angry at your own company about it is not going to get you anywhere.
[14652.82 → 14657.18] Because if you leave that company and go somewhere else, you're going to run into the same problem.
[14657.44 → 14657.84] So have fun.
[14658.08 → 14662.64] Is it good to yell constantly at your direct manager who sits across the room from you?
[14662.84 → 14663.08] Yeah.
[14663.22 → 14663.38] Yeah.
[14663.50 → 14664.10] Does that help?
[14664.20 → 14664.86] It's a good start.
[14664.92 → 14666.06] Does it make him less stressed?
[14666.22 → 14667.24] I said go for it.
[14667.90 → 14668.56] Yeah, do it.
[14669.14 → 14671.14] And that he is powerless to make any changes?
[14671.46 → 14671.84] No.
[14672.26 → 14673.14] I make some changes.
[14673.14 → 14673.70] He has power.
[14673.98 → 14674.20] Yeah.
[14674.34 → 14675.04] Don't kid yourself.
[14675.04 → 14675.60] He has power.
[14675.60 → 14678.18] If he's not changing something, it's because he doesn't f***ING want to.
[14678.78 → 14681.04] I will continue to yell then.
[14682.02 → 14682.56] No, I'm just.
[14682.70 → 14683.96] I'm somewhat fair enough.
[14684.04 → 14684.96] I can make changes.
[14685.60 → 14688.26] It's just, you can't fix communication completely.
[14688.50 → 14689.66] You can make efforts.
[14689.86 → 14691.04] You can try to improve things.
[14691.24 → 14692.66] And that helps a lot.
[14692.84 → 14693.06] Yeah.
[14693.12 → 14696.30] If both sides are making an effort, you can get a lot done.
[14696.46 → 14696.64] Yeah.
[14696.96 → 14703.10] And like, part of that is going to be like, if you notice a problem with some form of communication that's happening,
[14703.10 → 14708.56] voice it, make sure that you are also not a communication problem or as much as you can.
[14708.56 → 14712.94] And just try to understand that it's going to be an issue.
[14713.08 → 14714.48] Do what you can to mitigate it.
[14714.74 → 14716.20] Do what you can to improve things.
[14716.20 → 14720.12] If someone comes to you, I think you mentioned help leading a remote team.
[14720.24 → 14725.12] If someone comes to you and mentions a communication issue, try to act on it best you can.
[14725.12 → 14728.74] I find layering is helpful.
[14729.10 → 14731.86] So, and I don't always do this perfectly.
[14732.10 → 14733.48] I also have my own communication issues.
[14733.58 → 14734.14] Don't get me wrong.
[14735.16 → 14735.98] Stop it.
[14737.92 → 14740.30] But try to do it multiple times.
[14740.40 → 14744.60] So, like, if you say something vocally in a meeting, try to have it in text as well.
[14745.86 → 14750.74] If someone received something through an email, that is important.
[14750.94 → 14754.18] Yeah, they received it, but they might just not read that email or something.
[14754.18 → 14755.62] Copy it out.
[14755.68 → 14756.66] Put it in another chat.
[14757.08 → 14758.44] Tag people directly.
[14758.82 → 14760.20] Require reactions.
[14760.64 → 14762.42] This is something that...
[14762.42 → 14763.34] Oh, I love that.
[14763.46 → 14763.84] Dan...
[14763.84 → 14767.12] I have adopted that into my entire life and all my dev circles.
[14767.30 → 14767.88] It's brilliant.
[14768.28 → 14772.02] Dan from the Labs Web team started doing this with his team,
[14772.08 → 14774.48] and then I copied it in every scenario I possibly could,
[14774.88 → 14777.10] which is, like, when there's a PR,
[14777.60 → 14781.94] if you see it, you have to react with the like, eyeballs reaction.
[14781.94 → 14787.80] And if it's good to go, you have to react with the checkmark reaction.
[14788.00 → 14792.20] And it just means you have actual good receipts.
[14792.34 → 14795.10] Because red doesn't mean anything.
[14795.38 → 14797.40] Because notifications are totally broken.
[14797.72 → 14799.42] Things get marked as red all the time.
[14799.68 → 14801.58] Maybe you open your computer, and it's on that message,
[14801.70 → 14803.14] but you're looking for something really quickly,
[14803.18 → 14804.64] so you just immediately click off of it.
[14804.70 → 14805.76] Well, it just got marked as red.
[14805.78 → 14806.74] You're not going to see it again.
[14806.74 → 14810.36] But if someone goes through the effort to do that reaction,
[14810.46 → 14811.64] you know that they actually saw it.
[14811.66 → 14813.74] So if it's important enough, you can require reactions.
[14813.92 → 14816.52] And then you can check the reactions to see who didn't do it,
[14816.54 → 14819.04] and you can go after them directly to make them read the thing.
[14819.62 → 14820.38] That was a lot.
[14820.90 → 14821.12] Nice.
[14821.50 → 14821.70] Yeah.
[14821.92 → 14823.14] I love that system, actually.
[14824.52 → 14825.20] What else?
[14825.72 → 14828.82] How is the struggle dealing with doing things you love,
[14828.86 → 14830.24] but also doing it for a living,
[14830.40 → 14832.10] and the livelihood of others?
[14832.30 → 14834.36] Is the burden ever too much?
[14834.68 → 14835.52] It can be exhausting.
[14835.52 → 14835.64] It can be exhausting.
[14836.86 → 14841.74] Like, I still haven't tried the wireless Five index adapter.
[14842.98 → 14844.38] I got it plugged in.
[14844.96 → 14845.88] It's charged.
[14846.02 → 14846.40] It's ready.
[14846.66 → 14849.52] And I just have been...
[14850.36 → 14853.10] I've needed some decompression time when I've been at home lately
[14853.10 → 14855.34] instead of tinkering with tech.
[14855.44 → 14856.58] Sometimes it's all I want to do.
[14856.68 → 14858.64] Sometimes it's nice to have a break.
[14859.14 → 14863.02] And even though I'm really interested in it,
[14863.44 → 14864.76] and I want to know how it works,
[14864.76 → 14865.88] I just look at it and I go,
[14866.02 → 14867.22] right, but before I can do that,
[14867.24 → 14869.46] I'm going to have to spend an hour just, like, fighting with it.
[14869.52 → 14871.06] I'm going to have to take notes while I do it,
[14871.14 → 14874.54] which saps a lot of the joy out of the discovery.
[14874.70 → 14876.26] Yeah, it makes it feel a lot more like work.
[14876.32 → 14876.70] It's tough.
[14877.84 → 14878.32] It's tough.
[14878.38 → 14879.68] I don't have a perfect answer.
[14879.68 → 14881.16] Hi, Linus and team.
[14881.24 → 14882.86] You always say not to pre-order things,
[14882.96 → 14885.76] but what would you say about pre-ordering a framework laptop?
[14885.98 → 14888.36] I actually did and can't wait receiving it.
[14888.86 → 14891.32] I would tell you the same thing I always say.
[14891.46 → 14892.82] I would say don't pre-order things.
[14893.14 → 14895.00] If I were to give you a different answer
[14895.00 → 14897.10] just because I was an investor in the company,
[14897.22 → 14899.00] then you should never trust anything I say ever again.
[14899.00 → 14906.18] Hey, LLD, has anyone tried to use the S24 AI image search on faces?
[14906.42 → 14909.78] For example, Linus, would it find the LDT store mouse pad?
[14910.02 → 14912.26] Memes, LinkedIn, what about other people?
[14912.48 → 14915.34] With love, the guy that Luke signed his word, 1997.
[14916.00 → 14919.00] I have not tried it, but that actually sounds kind of awesome.
[14920.36 → 14922.76] Hello, WAN.DLL, first Mere matches.
[14923.20 → 14923.54] Hold on.
[14923.76 → 14924.88] I'm actually thinking of getting one.
[14925.58 → 14926.38] I really like it.
[14926.38 → 14928.60] I did an unboxing for Short Circuit.
[14928.72 → 14929.38] That went up today.
[14930.44 → 14931.86] S24, it looks kind of sick.
[14932.26 → 14934.18] I still hate hole-punch cameras,
[14934.46 → 14937.56] but obviously I'm not getting away from that anytime soon.
[14939.10 → 14940.88] You can with this phone.
[14941.00 → 14942.22] The screen's incredible.
[14942.48 → 14943.20] What phone is that?
[14943.30 → 14944.50] The anti-glare coating on it.
[14944.76 → 14945.40] It's unbelievable.
[14945.64 → 14946.24] What phone do you have, Dan?
[14946.36 → 14949.96] I have the Sony 1X.
[14950.22 → 14951.76] Yeah, Sony, I can't figure out how to move
[14951.76 → 14953.22] the stupid back button to the right, though.
[14954.16 → 14954.52] What?
[14954.52 → 14956.80] Oh, it's just like a toggle.
[14957.16 → 14958.06] It is not.
[14958.68 → 14959.14] Toggle it.
[14959.40 → 14959.84] Prove them wrong.
[14960.32 → 14960.62] Uh-oh.
[14961.22 → 14961.72] Fight time.
[14961.82 → 14964.80] It's going to be my second Apple Arcade moment of the day.
[14964.90 → 14965.56] It'll be great.
[14966.94 → 14970.06] Either that or it'll be Dan's first Apple Arcade moment of the day.
[14973.22 → 14974.34] Oh my God, he's right.
[14975.08 → 14975.98] Yeah, ridiculous, right?
[14976.04 → 14976.54] Why wouldn't they?
[14976.64 → 14979.52] It's part of like AOSP or whatever.
[14979.66 → 14980.22] Oh, no.
[14980.38 → 14981.88] I can no longer recommend this phone.
[14981.88 → 14985.18] How do they, how do they, like, what the heck?
[14985.76 → 14986.58] And I get it.
[14986.62 → 14988.16] Some people like the back button on the left.
[14988.22 → 14988.72] That's nice.
[14988.82 → 14992.90] I love that you like the back button on the left, but it is, it is as far as I can tell,
[14993.34 → 14997.94] just like a toggle the developer of the Android skin can just enable.
[14998.08 → 15001.12] It's absolutely part of the top level.
[15001.22 → 15001.72] I don't think I use it.
[15001.72 → 15004.42] I think I swipe from the side all the time.
[15004.52 → 15005.16] Yeah, that's fine.
[15005.34 → 15006.40] I don't like gesture.
[15006.90 → 15009.72] And I like three buttons and I like the back button on the left.
[15009.86 → 15013.94] And I'm not going to tell you guys not to like your ways, just like I will not allow
[15013.94 → 15016.60] a phone manufacturer to tell me that I'm not allowed to like my way.
[15016.66 → 15019.78] If I want the back button on the right, then I want the back button on the right.
[15019.86 → 15020.14] Wow.
[15020.30 → 15020.58] Okay.
[15020.70 → 15023.14] No, I'm never recommending this phone to anyone again.
[15023.14 → 15024.10] Well, okay.
[15025.10 → 15026.08] No, Luke, you don't understand.
[15026.16 → 15027.44] That's actually enough for me.
[15028.28 → 15029.16] No, I believe you.
[15029.42 → 15031.32] I am insane.
[15031.72 → 15033.26] At this point, I've worked with him for a while.
[15033.34 → 15034.52] I fully believe that.
[15034.78 → 15034.98] Yeah.
[15035.68 → 15037.86] No questions there at all.
[15038.10 → 15039.60] Don't buy a Sony ever again.
[15040.86 → 15041.84] The back buttons.
[15042.30 → 15045.12] Dan, would you recommend that people work at Linus Media Group?
[15045.66 → 15045.86] Oh.
[15047.58 → 15048.38] Heavy question.
[15048.38 → 15053.46] Are you the kind of person, anybody out there, are you the kind of person that would own
[15053.46 → 15061.82] a Porsche like Linus and change the blades of your wiper blades just for the principle
[15061.82 → 15062.52] of doing it?
[15062.88 → 15066.28] If you are, then I think you're going to fit into the team here.
[15067.98 → 15068.46] Okay.
[15068.54 → 15069.74] So a conditional yes.
[15070.20 → 15071.20] A conditional yes.
[15071.40 → 15071.94] If...
[15071.94 → 15073.14] That honestly makes sense.
[15073.86 → 15077.62] If not giving the user the right for a...
[15077.62 → 15082.64] Like, it's part of Android, the basic thing, to be able to switch the buttons.
[15082.64 → 15087.58] If that was something that somebody had to develop for, or like, you know, Touch ID doesn't
[15087.58 → 15090.44] support it, so you do your own launcher, then all right, fine.
[15090.68 → 15090.94] You know.
[15091.72 → 15092.68] But for...
[15092.68 → 15094.56] Just not turn on a knob?
[15095.24 → 15097.28] Like, it took efforts to probably disable that.
[15097.36 → 15097.58] Yeah.
[15097.78 → 15098.36] In my opinion.
[15098.46 → 15099.64] It just bothers me so much, man.
[15099.76 → 15103.78] And if it's not in the debug or anything like that, like, god-damn.
[15104.06 → 15106.98] I mean, I actually hate...
[15106.98 → 15109.28] For me, like, I like when Android 11...
[15109.28 → 15110.48] Now you got me fucking...
[15110.48 → 15111.94] That got me ranting!
[15111.94 → 15112.94] I'm fucking...
[15112.94 → 15114.40] I'm angry, man!
[15114.68 → 15116.10] Oh, god, I almost said it twice.
[15118.42 → 15120.84] Everything on Android is giant now.
[15121.02 → 15122.32] All the buttons are huge.
[15123.02 → 15123.40] All...
[15123.40 → 15124.28] Like, the clock.
[15124.64 → 15125.34] This is...
[15125.34 → 15125.80] This is...
[15125.80 → 15129.16] This screen has the highest pixels per inch of any phone on the market.
[15129.26 → 15131.02] Yeah, and how's that information density, Dan?
[15131.04 → 15132.84] It's 660 pixels per inch.
[15132.84 → 15134.06] You making use of that density?
[15134.24 → 15136.80] I can't, because Android is garbage.
[15137.32 → 15138.32] I hate it.
[15138.72 → 15139.36] Oh, man.
[15139.36 → 15139.86] Abacus.
[15139.92 → 15140.62] Give me an abacus.
[15141.16 → 15142.44] I'm going to the forest.
[15142.60 → 15145.12] I'm going to live with the forest things.
[15147.00 → 15147.48] Yeah.
[15147.74 → 15148.44] See you later, Dan.
[15148.52 → 15148.86] Bye.
[15148.86 → 15153.18] What the fuck is this show?
[15153.86 → 15155.38] I still don't know.
[15155.82 → 15157.90] My meds are off now.
[15159.52 → 15163.82] I've been hosting it for over a decade, Luke, and I still don't know what it is.
[15164.32 → 15166.02] There is no more Faux Quest.
[15166.02 → 15168.32] I'm going to go...
[15168.32 → 15171.40] I'm going to go write an app to switch those...
[15171.40 → 15173.16] Switch those buttons.
[15173.78 → 15175.22] It, like, intercepts your input?
[15175.54 → 15176.22] Moves...
[15176.22 → 15177.12] Oh, jeez.
[15177.32 → 15177.74] Jeez.
[15178.38 → 15180.78] Hello, WAN DLL.
[15181.32 → 15182.08] First merch...
[15182.08 → 15183.24] First, I merch message.
[15183.36 → 15184.20] I'm so sorry, man.
[15185.04 → 15190.24] What are some of the most cool or unusual pieces of tech you've seen put into a PC case?
[15190.24 → 15194.32] For example, I saw someone put a discreet car stereo into one ages ago.
[15194.68 → 15199.50] Back in the old days, people used to put all kinds of wild things in the front of the five and a quarter inch bay.
[15199.76 → 15200.24] Like, uh...
[15200.24 → 15200.26] Yeah.
[15200.30 → 15200.94] Oh, yeah.
[15201.02 → 15202.02] The cigarette lighter.
[15202.18 → 15202.42] Yeah.
[15202.62 → 15203.10] It was fun.
[15203.52 → 15204.26] It's just...
[15204.26 → 15204.74] That's...
[15204.74 → 15206.00] Wow, that really shouldn't be there.
[15206.08 → 15206.40] Yeah.
[15206.60 → 15207.56] You shouldn't smoke around your computer.
[15207.82 → 15213.68] The amount of, like, cigarette smoke tar that I've had to try to remove from computers over the years.
[15213.76 → 15214.24] Like, just stop.
[15214.96 → 15215.18] Yeah.
[15215.30 → 15215.94] Go smoke outside.
[15215.94 → 15218.52] It goes right into the intake fan, because that's how fans work.
[15218.66 → 15218.96] Yeah.
[15218.96 → 15219.04] Yeah.
[15219.84 → 15220.16] Jeez.
[15221.44 → 15222.34] That's a good answer.
[15222.56 → 15222.86] Last one.
[15222.92 → 15223.36] Am I curated?
[15223.84 → 15228.34] We basically use an Apple TV as a coaster with all the smart TVs, so I'm curious.
[15228.48 → 15233.86] What is the most expensive piece of tech the company or employees have that does not get used as intended at all?
[15234.78 → 15240.06] I mean, I did my thing on that super expensive circulation fan last week, so I won't talk about that.
[15240.14 → 15241.48] I could talk about our 3D printers.
[15241.48 → 15245.32] Man, the kinds of things that I've seen people using 3D printers for internally.
[15245.58 → 15247.62] We do a lot of perfect things with them.
[15247.82 → 15247.90] Yes.
[15247.90 → 15248.88] Prototyping products.
[15248.96 → 15255.52] And, you know, creating holders for our slates and pens for the sets and all kinds of very useful things.
[15255.92 → 15261.82] But one stood out to me, and this was for a LAN event of some sort.
[15262.08 → 15265.82] We apparently 3D printed a gigantic batch of trophies.
[15265.82 → 15267.38] And I was sitting there going...
[15267.38 → 15274.78] These are the most generic trophies that could ever have existed.
[15275.10 → 15276.50] Could we have bought these for like a dollar?
[15276.62 → 15278.52] Could we have bought these at the dollar store?
[15279.18 → 15281.58] And the answer is often yes.
[15281.58 → 15285.80] And it happens all the time!
[15286.54 → 15291.10] We will design something that is actually available at Dollarama.
[15291.36 → 15293.66] We'll put the insert for a windshield wiper.
[15293.66 → 15295.16] We didn't design the trophies.
[15296.44 → 15297.46] Oh, they just downloaded a file?
[15298.04 → 15299.50] We did not design the trophies.
[15299.50 → 15301.06] I've seen things get designed.
[15301.06 → 15302.62] Unfortunately, you have.
[15302.62 → 15304.30] That we did not need to design.
[15304.84 → 15305.28] Yeah.
[15305.48 → 15306.30] That's what I thought.
[15306.62 → 15314.36] We designed, I think more than once, a like holder for a computer for our barcode scanner station.
[15314.50 → 15315.58] He's talking about me right now.
[15315.58 → 15320.34] When I was like, guys, you know the Microsoft Surface exists.
[15320.44 → 15322.48] You know there's one in inventory right now.
[15322.78 → 15325.12] It has a kickstand built into it.
[15327.36 → 15328.88] Just use that!
[15335.48 → 15337.52] And that's the stuff he complains about.
[15339.20 → 15340.40] Actually very reasonable.
[15340.64 → 15341.56] But also not.
[15342.38 → 15343.80] Okay, yeah, that's it.
[15343.90 → 15344.22] I'm done.
[15344.22 → 15346.24] I hope that rhino isn't 3D printed.
[15346.58 → 15347.02] The rhino?
[15347.28 → 15348.64] No, that is ceramic.
[15349.16 → 15351.42] I hope we didn't pay for that ceramic rhino.
[15351.58 → 15352.22] I'm sure we did.
[15352.28 → 15352.92] I'm sure we did.
[15353.10 → 15356.58] I hate, man, I hate how much just like knick-knacks cost.
[15356.88 → 15357.78] Drives me crazy.
[15358.00 → 15359.08] That thing does nothing.
[15359.16 → 15359.64] Table balls?
[15359.74 → 15360.98] It cost more than $2.
[15361.44 → 15362.52] It was a waste of money.
[15362.74 → 15364.78] Where do you think it was from, if you had to guess?
[15365.22 → 15366.64] I hope it's from Value Village.
[15367.12 → 15370.68] And I hope some other idiot paid $200 for it, and I paid $2 for it.
[15370.94 → 15373.34] Ceramic rhino.
[15373.34 → 15377.32] What were you saying ages ago with the super expensive table balls?
[15379.02 → 15380.06] What about them?
[15380.18 → 15381.46] I was just saying I hate that.
[15382.90 → 15385.86] There was a whole rant months ago about...
[15385.86 → 15389.44] Yeah, I think it was just basically this, like knick-knacks.
[15389.52 → 15391.12] It drives me crazy how much they cost.
[15391.24 → 15404.18] Oh, was it the bit about how I think the whole thing is just a conspiracy where designers buy this stuff because they get a commission for the project based on how much they spend total.
[15404.18 → 15411.84] So they'll just pad it with stupid line item things that are just an overpriced glass ball that they spend $400 on.
[15411.92 → 15412.62] So they make $40.
[15412.62 → 15417.44] I'm not sure, because we used to know one of those interior designers.
[15417.94 → 15418.38] Oh.
[15418.38 → 15422.44] And some of this stuff just is, like, expensive.
[15422.74 → 15426.94] I mean, the thing is, you go to, like, Home Sense or something like that, and it's an $80 table ball.
[15427.14 → 15427.38] Okay.
[15427.52 → 15433.60] But, like, this interior designer was like, well, we went to an artisan who would craft a table ball, and it'd be like $300.
[15433.60 → 15433.92] Sure.
[15434.74 → 15435.10] Sure.
[15435.22 → 15437.74] I mean, it's not like I don't understand that things are expensive.
[15437.74 → 15441.30] I mean, you're talking to the person who made a solid gold Xbox controller.
[15441.42 → 15441.98] I get it.
[15442.22 → 15444.70] Yeah, but that's a little bit different from, like, a knick-knack.
[15444.80 → 15447.00] That's an art piece, if you want to think about it that way.
[15447.10 → 15449.46] I think of it as more of an investment.
[15449.84 → 15452.74] I don't think of it as, I made a solid gold Xbox controller.
[15452.84 → 15454.56] I think of it as, I bought some gold.
[15455.84 → 15457.34] So that's my justification for that.
[15457.40 → 15462.56] As for, like, the artisan table ball made of glass or whatever, I don't know about you guys.
[15462.56 → 15463.68] I don't know how to justify it.
[15463.74 → 15466.92] I couldn't find this rhino, but I did find a $6,000 rhino.
[15467.62 → 15468.12] Oh, my God.
[15468.14 → 15469.04] How tall is that?
[15469.34 → 15470.82] It's 24 inches tall.
[15471.76 → 15473.02] It's like, what?
[15473.68 → 15475.08] Is that four feet long?
[15475.12 → 15476.30] It's by France.
[15478.24 → 15479.12] By France?
[15479.32 → 15480.12] Good job, country.
[15482.40 → 15482.76] What?
[15482.88 → 15483.46] Yeah, what the heck?
[15483.48 → 15484.12] Let's go up.
[15484.88 → 15485.44] Curse her up.
[15486.32 → 15486.66] Here, right?
[15486.72 → 15487.64] Up, up, left.
[15487.84 → 15488.38] Oh, wow.
[15488.52 → 15489.00] By France.
[15489.10 → 15489.52] Yeah, France.
[15489.64 → 15490.58] France made it.
[15490.86 → 15491.40] Good job, France.
[15491.56 → 15492.00] Look at the other thing.
[15492.00 → 15492.48] I love it.
[15492.80 → 15493.28] What is this?
[15493.38 → 15494.08] Oh, that's $8,000.
[15494.42 → 15494.72] What is that?
[15494.96 → 15495.68] I had a...
[15495.68 → 15496.42] Oh, wow.
[15496.72 → 15499.16] All right, so this is the type of stuff that they would put in your house.
[15499.26 → 15500.78] I had a blast.
[15501.86 → 15504.10] There is a secondhand shop.
[15504.42 → 15504.62] Okay.
[15506.02 → 15511.86] Someone at a partner sent me this couch brand that they were like, man, it'll change your
[15511.86 → 15512.18] life.
[15512.34 → 15514.88] You sit on this couch, you're never going to want to sit on any other couch.
[15514.88 → 15520.84] And I'm like, knowing you, this couch is stupid.
[15520.98 → 15521.78] 10 grand or something.
[15521.78 → 15524.50] Like, you're not even close, dude.
[15524.62 → 15525.34] 40 grand?
[15525.98 → 15527.56] Probably closer to that range.
[15527.64 → 15531.42] Anyway, this couch company is so far up their own ass.
[15531.68 → 15532.90] They already look like it.
[15532.90 → 15538.98] The store in Vancouver, the store in Vancouver, Luke, does not have a sign on it.
[15539.52 → 15540.34] Ah, yep.
[15540.34 → 15543.66] If you don't know where it is and who they are...
[15543.66 → 15544.46] Oh, I've been to this store.
[15544.58 → 15546.04] You don't deserve to be there.
[15547.54 → 15548.94] Anyway, so...
[15548.94 → 15549.80] That looks very comfy.
[15549.80 → 15552.98] They had like a $12,000 bean bag.
[15553.36 → 15553.58] Yeah.
[15553.76 → 15555.30] I think it was hand-knit or something.
[15555.30 → 15556.32] Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
[15556.38 → 15557.60] Anyway, the point is not this.
[15557.66 → 15562.18] The point is that I went there for fun because there's no way that I would spend that kind
[15562.18 → 15563.60] of money on any couch.
[15563.60 → 15566.60] It could give you an orgasm every time you sit on it and I wouldn't buy it.
[15566.60 → 15569.20] There are other ways to get that, and they're cheaper.
[15573.30 → 15575.14] But I went there just to check it out.
[15575.24 → 15576.50] To humour my...
[15576.50 → 15578.32] Questionable reusability factor.
[15578.72 → 15579.70] To humour my contact.
[15580.02 → 15581.16] Also the danger of the cheaper ones.
[15581.30 → 15581.42] Yeah.
[15581.68 → 15585.76] The number of people that say laundering when they see stuff like this, it's like, no.
[15585.92 → 15587.66] No, that is actually just their business.
[15587.92 → 15589.60] Not everything is money laundering.
[15590.14 → 15593.08] It's just like how people will just cry like tax write-off.
[15594.58 → 15594.98] No.
[15596.60 → 15597.48] Not how that works.
[15597.58 → 15597.86] Anyway.
[15598.76 → 15605.78] So I went just to know what a couch that costs as much as a whole ass vehicle.
[15606.06 → 15606.74] A new one.
[15606.84 → 15607.06] Yeah.
[15607.74 → 15609.50] Would be like, really nice couch.
[15610.50 → 15610.84] Great couch.
[15610.84 → 15611.72] It looks very comfy.
[15612.24 → 15618.06] But what I had the most fun with was actually the secondhand store a few doors down.
[15620.06 → 15620.46] Okay.
[15620.90 → 15624.36] If you're telling me I can get that comfy of a couch there for cheap, I'd be happy.
[15624.36 → 15625.74] While I was there.
[15626.28 → 15627.10] Hold on.
[15627.16 → 15630.20] Or is this one of those like crazy expensive secondhand stores?
[15630.48 → 15634.64] It was a secondhand store for things like those couches.
[15634.82 → 15635.16] Okay.
[15635.44 → 15635.90] Yeah.
[15636.76 → 15640.98] While I was there, I found this.
[15644.70 → 15645.66] I'm excited.
[15645.66 → 15651.44] It's a lamp.
[15651.68 → 15652.02] Okay.
[15652.40 → 15653.74] In the shape of a horse.
[15653.88 → 15654.34] All right.
[15656.48 → 15657.84] It costs...
[15657.84 → 15658.70] I can't see the break.
[15658.72 → 15661.26] 6,500 euros.
[15661.68 → 15662.00] Euros.
[15664.16 → 15664.64] Oh.
[15664.96 → 15665.66] And it is...
[15667.66 → 15668.98] Oh my God.
[15669.02 → 15670.38] How are their pictures so bad?
[15671.50 → 15672.22] Hold on.
[15672.22 → 15673.36] 9,500.
[15673.36 → 15673.88] How is it?
[15673.90 → 15675.30] How are these their only pictures?
[15676.36 → 15677.18] You don't need to see it.
[15677.30 → 15678.08] You do need to see it.
[15678.12 → 15679.52] It's the size of a horse.
[15679.92 → 15680.22] Oh.
[15680.60 → 15680.90] Wow.
[15681.00 → 15683.38] It is a horse-sized porcelain.
[15683.38 → 15684.42] So you also have...
[15684.42 → 15686.42] Where the f*** would you put this?
[15686.42 → 15690.42] Well, you also have an enormous mansion that you need to fill with things.
[15690.60 → 15691.38] I guess so.
[15691.48 → 15691.92] I would...
[15691.92 → 15692.48] I would...
[15692.48 → 15695.16] If I owned this, I would put it at the bottom of my pool.
[15695.16 → 15699.38] Just because you can?
[15699.52 → 15699.82] Yeah.
[15701.36 → 15703.06] I mean, that would be reasonable.
[15703.06 → 15707.06] You can scuba dive, inspect your $9,000 horse lamp.
[15707.16 → 15708.32] Five-year warranty, though.
[15709.08 → 15709.52] Nice.
[15710.02 → 15710.94] Oh, man.
[15711.30 → 15711.70] Sweet.
[15712.02 → 15712.20] Yeah.
[15712.28 → 15714.22] So it weighs 120 kilograms.
[15714.48 → 15716.20] So that's about 250 pounds.
[15717.18 → 15717.70] Whoa!
[15718.10 → 15721.66] It is 2.25 meters high.
[15721.66 → 15723.68] So that's about seven feet.
[15724.98 → 15726.56] It's enormous.
[15727.00 → 15728.10] Man, this place...
[15728.10 → 15729.70] Just for a trip, go on a date.
[15730.40 → 15731.42] Go down to Chinatown.
[15731.78 → 15732.08] Okay.
[15732.24 → 15732.90] Get some food.
[15733.20 → 15733.38] Yeah.
[15733.42 → 15734.28] Go with the missus.
[15734.90 → 15737.08] Just go hang out in this store for a bit.
[15737.20 → 15739.24] Hey, do you want to see how certain people live?
[15739.38 → 15741.84] Just play how much do you think this cost game.
[15742.80 → 15744.04] And you just, like, keep score.
[15744.04 → 15745.36] Bring a little notepad.
[15745.88 → 15747.76] And then play Price is Right rules.
[15748.02 → 15749.04] And see if you guys can...
[15749.68 → 15750.86] Just have some fun.
[15750.86 → 15752.22] It's actually fun.
[15752.50 → 15753.32] It's a blast.
[15754.00 → 15757.92] So I think the 100 Get song is just about that lamp.
[15761.00 → 15767.86] So to give you some idea of where it is, yeah, it's definitely...
[15767.86 → 15769.00] It's definitely...
[15769.00 → 15772.52] It's kind of east of Chinatown, southeast of Gaston.
[15773.56 → 15774.86] And it's called...
[15775.66 → 15776.12] Oh, man.
[15777.28 → 15778.62] No, that's not it.
[15778.62 → 15780.30] It might be...
[15780.30 → 15783.28] I think it's this one.
[15785.08 → 15788.44] Oh, no.
[15788.50 → 15789.34] This might not be it.
[15791.50 → 15792.92] This one's in the heart of an obstacle.
[15793.10 → 15793.86] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[15793.86 → 15794.22] Here it is.
[15794.34 → 15794.78] Here it is.
[15794.96 → 15795.18] Okay.
[15795.24 → 15795.60] I've got it.
[15795.68 → 15796.80] It's called Carriage House.
[15797.78 → 15798.96] Affordable luxury.
[15799.30 → 15801.26] Yeah, that horse was, like, half price.
[15801.26 → 15806.10] If I was more of an idiot, I'd be like, wow, what a deal.
[15806.16 → 15806.80] And I would buy it.
[15807.92 → 15814.48] So they are Vancouver's premier luxury furniture store, which is not actually quite right, because
[15814.48 → 15818.78] they're actually this, an upscale consignment boutique.
[15818.78 → 15826.68] So if you're not familiar with consignment, basically, you drop off your thing, and then the price
[15826.68 → 15828.70] goes down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[15828.76 → 15832.80] The store handles this for you until it sells, and then they keep some percentage, and they
[15832.80 → 15833.74] give you some percentage.
[15833.86 → 15838.60] So obviously, it's in their interest to curate the items in the store to make sure they're
[15838.60 → 15840.02] offering a variety.
[15840.02 → 15845.08] And it's in your interest to have it sell, presumably, at the highest price possible.
[15845.14 → 15849.86] So it's almost like a reverse auction, where it starts high, and then goes low, low, low,
[15849.86 → 15853.00] low, low, until it sells, or until I think you, like, come back and get it.
[15853.02 → 15854.70] So it's kind of like a classy pawn shop.
[15856.58 → 15857.42] Man, it's just...
[15858.94 → 15861.30] That horse would be a great way to get people in the door.
[15861.46 → 15863.14] Freaking wild, though, dude.
[15863.22 → 15864.48] Like, I don't know.
[15864.78 → 15867.48] We should get that horse and put it in the lobby.
[15867.84 → 15869.44] These lamps aren't that bad.
[15869.44 → 15872.58] I mean, more than I would spend on a lamp.
[15872.90 → 15874.08] Ralph Lauren lamp.
[15874.64 → 15876.06] Why is there a Ralph Lauren lamp?
[15876.12 → 15877.44] I don't know, because...
[15878.00 → 15879.66] It doesn't look good.
[15879.66 → 15880.94] Dude, I don't know.
[15881.32 → 15883.74] It looks like someone put a lamp head on, like, a tripod.
[15884.22 → 15886.90] Like, it looks like it has the three legs connecting...
[15886.90 → 15887.42] $900.
[15887.92 → 15888.28] Here you go.
[15888.50 → 15888.84] Like a camera tripod.
[15889.06 → 15889.86] That doesn't look good.
[15890.22 → 15890.56] Well...
[15890.56 → 15891.18] You get two, though.
[15891.28 → 15891.80] They're half-priced.
[15891.84 → 15892.38] Yeah, two.
[15892.46 → 15893.42] But, like, I'm not even trying to...
[15893.42 → 15895.46] Like, if that was $15, I'd be like, that's an unattractive lamp.
[15895.46 → 15897.20] Okay, show me a lamp that you think looks good.
[15897.20 → 15897.88] I don't know.
[15897.88 → 15901.12] Google lamp, and you'll probably find better-looking lamps than these.
[15903.22 → 15904.62] Let me Google lamp.
[15904.84 → 15905.42] What a hater.
[15906.78 → 15911.62] Hey, I immediately found multiple better-looking lamps, and I haven't even, like, clicked in on it.
[15912.90 → 15913.76] Like, what do you mean?
[15913.78 → 15915.36] Yeah, there's a Christie projector lamp.
[15916.04 → 15916.80] Who doesn't like that?
[15916.90 → 15918.58] A bunch of these look super cool.
[15919.60 → 15920.90] They're also really expensive.
[15921.06 → 15921.76] These are very expensive.
[15921.76 → 15922.50] Lighting is flipping expensive.
[15922.50 → 15923.76] Lighting is really expensive.
[15923.76 → 15926.66] They know where you've been shopping for the last five minutes.
[15926.78 → 15927.86] Also, probably that.
[15928.74 → 15929.98] That's probably a thing.
[15930.44 → 15931.04] But here we go.
[15931.12 → 15931.32] Look.
[15932.12 → 15933.14] This is a cheap lamp.
[15933.98 → 15934.98] That looks cool.
[15938.04 → 15940.48] It doesn't have enough animals in it.
[15941.18 → 15942.38] It's not a horse.
[15942.92 → 15944.44] It means more tessellation.
[15945.10 → 15947.60] I only like things that are tessellated, like it's 2009.
[15947.60 → 15952.58] So you'll know that I've completely gone off the rails when I own that horse lamp.
[15952.60 → 15953.24] If you buy that horse.
[15953.54 → 15956.52] That's your canary in the coal mine?
[15956.66 → 15956.86] Yeah.
[15956.96 → 15958.36] Is you buying that horse lamp?
[15958.44 → 15958.60] Yeah.
[15958.78 → 15960.02] What if we 3D printed you one?
[15960.02 → 15960.28] You've lost it.
[15961.90 → 15964.34] I'm looking at some very large format 3D printers.
[15965.54 → 15965.94] Why?
[15967.54 → 15968.56] Obviously for content.
[15969.54 → 15969.76] Hmm.
[15970.62 → 15970.88] Okay.
[15971.06 → 15971.82] Four feet tall?
[15971.98 → 15972.66] Yeah, I'm into it.
[15973.32 → 15975.18] Yeah, we could do a minute.
[15975.18 → 15976.90] We could do a Shetland lamp.
[15977.60 → 15982.52] Oh my goodness.
[15984.30 → 15985.68] I'm 3D printing a horse lamp.
[15985.68 → 15985.90] Okay.
[15987.10 → 15989.76] The last merch message is WAN DLL.
[15989.96 → 15993.46] What was the hardest decision to make in 2023 that in hindsight should have been simple?
[15995.74 → 15998.10] Letting the WAN show go for four hours at a time.
[15998.54 → 16000.06] It's just so obvious now.
[16001.40 → 16002.84] How long has the show gone on today?
[16002.92 → 16003.74] Four and a half hours.
[16003.74 → 16004.00] All right.
[16004.12 → 16004.70] How was it?
[16004.70 → 16005.48] Let's get the f*** out of here.
[16005.50 → 16006.82] How was it so short before?
[16006.98 → 16007.40] I don't know.
[16007.40 → 16008.60] What did we even do differently?
[16008.76 → 16009.04] I don't know.
[16009.14 → 16011.38] You spent an hour and a half on the first topic.
[16012.82 → 16014.00] Well, way to go, Dan.
[16014.62 → 16015.60] Yeah, it's Dan's fault.
[16015.62 → 16016.58] Yeah, technically.
[16016.70 → 16017.36] Look what you've done.
[16017.60 → 16017.84] Yeah.
[16018.24 → 16019.74] I regret nothing.
[16020.28 → 16021.20] We'll see you again next week.
[16021.20 → 16021.56] Nothing!
[16021.82 → 16023.50] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[16023.74 → 16024.02] Bye!
[16025.70 → 16026.02] Nothing!
[16026.02 → 16026.18] Nothing!
[16026.18 → 16026.64] Nothing!
[16026.64 → 16027.96] I'm sorry!
[16027.96 → 16029.60] I don't know.
[16029.60 → 16030.42] I'm sorry!
