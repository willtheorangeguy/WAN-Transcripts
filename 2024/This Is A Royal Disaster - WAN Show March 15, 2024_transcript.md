[0.00 --> 6.06]  We've got a great show for you guys today. Did you know that your car is a snitch?
[6.90 --> 11.72]  That's right. It's not these snitches gonna get some well, you know
[13.08 --> 16.58]  Repairs more expensive on dough monthly insurance
[17.82 --> 23.04]  Also, where is Kate? I forgot her name. I was gonna say
[24.00 --> 26.00]  All the capes I know Winslet
[26.00 --> 33.62]  Kate Middleton. Where is Kate Middleton? That's right. We're gonna be talking about the big scandal. That's rockin the royal world
[33.80 --> 39.52]  That's our headline topic not because either of us gives two flying shits about what goes on with the royals
[39.52 --> 43.32]  Nope, but I didn't know who this was but because of the technology
[43.88 --> 51.90]  Yeah, it seems to be at the core of what's going on. What else we got today? Yeah, speaking of technology EU AI regulations
[51.90 --> 57.00]  Uh, are regulations good? Do we not want them? Do we want to them heated debate?
[57.00 --> 57.60]  We'll really
[57.60 --> 65.70]  Why do you pick such bad topics? Okay, it's like you prepare yourself for me to take all the good ones and you just work your way from the bottom
[65.70 --> 67.70]  AMD ups the hurts is like
[67.70 --> 69.90]  All right
[69.90 --> 71.50]  AMD ups the what's the hearts
[71.50 --> 74.60]  No, you could take that one. Why would you pick that one?
[74.60 --> 77.40]  What why would no? I'm not picking that yeah
[77.40 --> 83.54]  Yeah, I'm saying why would you think that weird notebook check article about our video would you pick that one? No?
[83.54 --> 87.52]  No, okay, what do we have left? There's only two articles left
[87.52 --> 94.78]  Would you pick FCC quadruples minimum internet speed required for broadband label? No, I would take the Airbnb bans cameras
[95.18 --> 99.64]  In Airbnb's it's it's a main time school past that. I thought you took all the main
[101.76 --> 103.76]  Airbnb bans cameras
[107.40 --> 126.40]  The show is brought to you by the ridge to square space and vessi all right
[126.40 --> 129.22]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic now?
[129.22 --> 134.92]  I know that you're an avid royal watcher, so none of this is gonna be news to you
[134.92 --> 137.94]  But Kate Middleton the princess of Wales
[138.50 --> 140.26]  Sure, what does that mean?
[140.26 --> 142.74]  Um, I think it means that
[143.24 --> 146.16]  She's not princess of the fire kingdom
[146.16 --> 148.68]  Okay, or lumpy space but water
[148.68 --> 154.76]  um because yeah, I'm not look the rules seem really complicated because the elements are like
[155.30 --> 161.04]  Lumps fire candy. I don't really get it. The point is there's a princess of Wales
[161.04 --> 166.96]  And she's been the subject of intense news coverage and online speculation over the past few days
[167.50 --> 173.44]  After a Mother's Day image of her sent to various wire services turned out to have been significantly
[173.44 --> 176.48]  Doctored now before well remember like newswire
[176.88 --> 180.88]  Okay, yeah like that kind that kind of that kind of wire services not like money wiring
[180.88 --> 182.04]  Yeah, so Luke
[182.04 --> 186.84]  Let's have a look at this and see if there's anything that raises you haven't read through the notes yet, right?
[186.84 --> 193.30]  No good good good good good. Okay, so we're gonna bring it up on here is there anything about this picture that raises the alarm bells
[193.30 --> 198.28]  To you without without looking at anything else. No, no, no, it's just stop stop. I was just trying to zoom
[198.28 --> 200.28]  Stop it's my eyes are bad
[200.28 --> 203.64]  I'm immediately looking at hands. Okay, um
[203.74 --> 210.32]  How are those our those hands looking for you the hands seem fine so her left hand so right side for us
[210.80 --> 217.68]  That like this thing that I'm doing yeah where it's just like they're all very straight and it's kind of a pan. Yep. Yep. Yeah
[217.68 --> 224.96]  Yeah, actually I'm seeing it on the other side a little bit too. That's fairly common for once once AI imagery got good at fingers
[224.96 --> 230.46]  They started just making them like here's a board of fingers, but it's not quite happening her one finger
[230.46 --> 235.86]  There's a little bit separated. So no, I think the hands are fine. Yeah, I mean I couldn't help noticing
[236.18 --> 240.74]  That this is sharp and this hand is extremely blurry very blurry. Yeah
[240.74 --> 247.58]  um, also that appears to be in the same plane as this hand which is not especially blurry. Yeah
[247.58 --> 251.04]  um, it it looks like it's been touched up and and
[251.80 --> 256.72]  Doctor to a certain degree, but that would happen no matter what any picture of Royals is gonna be touched up
[256.72 --> 260.04]  Is there anything here that jumps out to you as potentially problematic?
[260.66 --> 266.42]  Yeah, wait, what's going on? Oh, there's a sniper. There's a sniper. Oh my god Kate the hair on the
[266.42 --> 270.58]  The right side of her head is like super
[271.38 --> 272.26]  Fuzzy
[272.26 --> 279.06]  Mm-hmm and I don't mean oh man. I can't use that term. It's a very like blurred and also yeah, like where's her shirt?
[279.78 --> 282.74]  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It just looks like a shadowed version of
[284.26 --> 289.78]  Okay, yeah, I mean that could be a thing there's there could be some there could be some biz there has been some
[290.66 --> 295.94]  Surprisingly serious and poorly done question mark doctoring to her hair on the one side
[296.50 --> 297.54]  What's up with that?
[297.54 --> 300.02]  Uh, okay, her whole head looks like it might
[300.98 --> 302.98]  So not originate from this photo
[303.70 --> 307.06]  Yeah, so here's the thing. Oh, oh
[309.06 --> 314.58]  Oh, okay, let's look really closely at the the non squared one on the left looks really closely on the right one
[314.90 --> 317.86]  Her cheek dimples. How are those exactly the same?
[319.78 --> 321.78]  It looks like maybe no
[322.50 --> 323.62]  Sir
[323.62 --> 328.90]  It looks like maybe like yes look at how and well. Oh, yeah, but she's gonna have cheek dimples no matter what
[328.98 --> 333.62]  So like look at how deep they are like how wide her smile is by how deep they are now scroll up and look in the other one
[333.70 --> 340.74]  Okay, yeah, well, this is overlaid like we can't really look at the dimples. Okay. It's really blurry. It's very blurry
[340.74 --> 342.98]  It's blurry. Why is it so blurry?
[343.70 --> 348.18]  It's aren't very blurry. No, the kids are the kids are not blurry. The kids are pretty well defined
[348.18 --> 352.34]  So basically, let's let's let's run through this. Let's run through this
[352.34 --> 356.18]  Yeah, middleton's last public appearance was on christmas day
[357.30 --> 363.54]  Which for those who math is if I didn't work here my last public appearance would have been a long time ago
[363.54 --> 367.78]  Okay, all right. The point is her job is literally to make public appearances. So
[367.78 --> 369.78]  So that's what yeah
[369.78 --> 374.10]  All right. Oh, so her last public appearance was on christmas day on january 17th the royal family announced
[374.10 --> 378.42]  She would be undergoing scheduled abdominal surgery and would return to the public eye around easter
[378.66 --> 382.26]  Which in fairness is not until a couple of weeks from now
[382.50 --> 383.94]  Most people accepted this explanation
[384.50 --> 390.66]  But there was some question as to why she would need to cancel weeks of upcoming events if this surgery was truly expected and planned
[391.46 --> 393.46]  Yes
[394.02 --> 398.26]  That's a good point. Well, nothing truly suspicious had happened yet people were being extremely
[398.66 --> 405.94]  Conspiratorial about all of this on some segments of social media by about late february and this is pretty typical of
[406.50 --> 409.46]  Royal watchers, you know whether it's whether it's um
[411.70 --> 413.70]  Help me out the actress
[414.90 --> 420.02]  Megan markle and prince harry, uh, or whether it's uh kate and william people are
[420.02 --> 428.74]  All megan markle. That's her name, right? She was an actress. She's on suits. I've never seen that. Okay. It doesn't matter the point the point is
[429.78 --> 430.66]  That
[430.66 --> 438.58]  Okay, the point is that that that people follow the royals extremely closely and anything even remotely resembling a scandal
[438.98 --> 442.34]  Seems to blow up pretty spectacularly unless it's prince andrew
[443.22 --> 448.50]  In which case we just all seem to cool that yeah, we yeah, he went to what island?
[449.38 --> 451.22]  Hawaii oh, hawaii
[451.78 --> 453.78]  hawaiiland
[456.90 --> 458.26]  Oh my goodness, um, okay
[458.26 --> 466.82]  This mother's day photo received initial scrutiny because it had a few obvious inconsistencies like and luke didn't even notice this
[467.30 --> 470.66]  Even though he is a self-professed expert on the royals
[471.70 --> 473.70]  Kate was not wearing a wedding ring
[474.34 --> 478.18]  Wait and no, I looked for that. What hand do you wear wedding ring on?
[478.18 --> 480.18]  Oh
[481.22 --> 486.18]  You're right tell me tell me tell oh man could you be left?
[486.50 --> 492.58]  Could you be less you know into the whole natural anything? It's not goes on your left hand. Oh, then we should be able to see it
[492.66 --> 494.66]  Uh, yes, we should definitely be able to see it
[494.66 --> 495.78]  I thought it might have been under the kids arm
[495.94 --> 502.98]  Not only that but there was a fully unfurl or there's a tree with fully unfurled green leaves in the background despite it being
[502.98 --> 504.98]  Supposedly early March
[505.30 --> 510.98]  Observers then noted clear signs when it's mother's i thought mother's days in me mother's day is like coming up
[511.46 --> 514.66]  Yeah, but this is I don't know. It's a mother's day photo. I don't know. Don't worry about it
[514.66 --> 518.82]  So they took it like way ahead of mother's day. I don't know when uk mother's day is okay
[520.74 --> 522.74]  What are y'all doing over there, huh?
[522.74 --> 523.78]  The point is
[523.78 --> 531.14]  observers then noted clear signs of editing including heavy use of a blurring tool and inconsistencies in the family's hair and clothing
[531.14 --> 540.42]  Uh wire services generally only allow small cosmetic edits like cropping and red eye removal leading them to retract the picture only a few hours later
[541.22 --> 546.18]  A tweet attributed to kate middleton claimed fault for the bad photoshop job
[546.42 --> 550.74]  But that has not stopped posts insisting that the photo was entirely ai generated
[551.06 --> 555.30]  Or that the princess's face was photoshopped into the photo over that of another woman
[555.78 --> 559.06]  However, according to tom warren of the verge the photos metadata
[559.06 --> 566.90]  indicates that it was shot on a canon 5d mark 4 and edited using a 2022 version of photoshop from before ai features were added
[567.62 --> 572.90]  Some online sleuths have insisted that middleton's face in the photo matches and was taken from her cover on vogue
[573.22 --> 577.70]  While detractors say that it simply looks similar because it is a picture of the same woman with the same face
[577.70 --> 581.14]  I mean the lighting is different her bottom teeth are slightly showing in the mother's day photo, etc. Yeah
[581.14 --> 583.94]  like to be completely honest if you look at a bunch of pictures of
[583.94 --> 587.46]  Of linus at like various conventions posing with people
[588.26 --> 591.06]  The like i am taking a photo face
[591.70 --> 593.94]  Yeah, it's pretty similar. Yeah, so
[595.46 --> 597.62]  Is it necessarily
[597.62 --> 599.62]  The exact same face?
[599.86 --> 604.18]  Um, I don't 100 think so. I don't 100 think so but I also
[604.82 --> 608.50]  Do not know for sure that it isn't yeah. I see what they're getting at
[608.50 --> 615.38]  They they are they are very similar, but you said this is a person whose job is to make public appearances
[615.38 --> 621.86]  They're going to have a smoking a photo face. I'm taking a photo smile. Yeah, so our question here because realistically
[622.10 --> 628.10]  I don't think any not either of us is other than a general concern for
[628.90 --> 631.38]  Anyone who has been disappeared?
[631.38 --> 638.98]  Uh, I don't think either of us is particularly into the whole royals thing. So if there's any intrigue in like, you know, oh
[638.98 --> 645.86]  Is this how they're, you know going to soft announce a divorce or you know, whatever because there was some speculation that
[646.42 --> 647.54]  um
[647.54 --> 649.54]  Not harry not andrew the other one
[650.10 --> 651.06]  William jeff
[651.06 --> 651.86]  uh
[653.14 --> 656.42]  That's not a royal name luke king jeffrey
[657.70 --> 660.50]  Okay, this game of thrones
[661.38 --> 663.38]  Is not real
[666.34 --> 670.18]  I think it was joffrey anyway wasn't it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I only read the first book
[670.50 --> 674.82]  I have a I have a whole thing where I won't consume content until it's all produced
[675.46 --> 680.26]  So i'm waiting for him to finish all the books. Oh, yeah, I know that might be a problem
[680.26 --> 684.90]  He's actually going to die before I get to read game of thrones if you google king jeff
[685.38 --> 687.38]  It's just really ripped dude
[687.38 --> 692.34]  I don't know how that happened
[692.34 --> 694.98]  I mean, maybe she was the one cheating with king jeff
[695.62 --> 697.62]  Hey, maybe I wouldn't blame her
[697.62 --> 701.46]  Dude king jeff is jacked. Mind you, I don't know how much of his testicles are left at that point
[701.46 --> 702.02]  None
[702.66 --> 704.66]  But he's ripped
[705.54 --> 706.66]  Who cares at that point?
[707.22 --> 709.22]  Oh, man, don't do steroids
[709.22 --> 712.02]  What are we even talking about?
[712.02 --> 712.74]  Who knows?
[712.74 --> 713.30]  Yeah, okay
[713.30 --> 718.74]  The point is the point is we're not royal watchers, but this is really interesting because
[718.74 --> 720.74]  Because
[724.50 --> 726.50]  This is interesting because
[727.62 --> 733.54]  It raises a really interesting question with the way that this is being covered by the mainstream media and with the way
[734.10 --> 734.98]  that
[734.98 --> 736.18]  topics like
[736.18 --> 739.62]  Photoshop over the years and more recently
[740.18 --> 743.22]  AI are making their way into the public consciousness
[743.22 --> 748.18]  This feels like a really significant moment
[748.18 --> 753.38]  Because you and I on the WAN show and you guys who watch the WAN show you dialed into this stuff
[753.38 --> 756.98]  You know what the capabilities of large language models are
[756.98 --> 762.34]  I mean you watched us reacting live to the launch of chat gpt and interacting with the thing right
[762.90 --> 769.70]  You're uh, whether it's you know mid journey or dolly, you know, you're you're looking at the ever evolving capabilities
[769.70 --> 771.70]  Of these of these
[772.18 --> 776.10]  AI image generators and stuff like that so you guys are dialed into it
[776.10 --> 780.10]  But this right here is sparking a conversation
[780.74 --> 788.90]  With the normies, you know with the aunts and uncles and nieces and the extended family all your cousins are talking about this
[789.30 --> 795.70]  And they're asking the question is anything that I am looking at real real anymore
[795.70 --> 800.66]  And with the amount of bots on things like x.com and other various websites. It's like
[801.78 --> 808.10]  Speaking of which we're streaming. We're streaming on x.com for the first time today. Yeah. Yeah, we're live we're live on x or are we?
[809.46 --> 811.46]  I hope so
[811.46 --> 812.34]  I haven't checked in a while
[812.34 --> 819.30]  Video what if you just combined that and audio whatever luke, let me push back on one of your hypotheses, okay?
[819.30 --> 826.82]  My hypothesis one of your hypotheses, okay, so you you had said it's it's quite it's quite
[827.46 --> 830.82]  Probable that she has a photo taking face. Yeah, okay
[831.54 --> 837.86]  So what if yeah, this is slightly different what if it's slightly different though, because
[840.82 --> 844.58]  An ai was trained on this photo and a handful of other photos
[844.58 --> 848.42]  What if it looks so similar?
[850.02 --> 853.78]  Because kind of like we've seen very famous works of art
[854.34 --> 856.74]  Basically spat out with slight alterations
[857.30 --> 858.98]  by ai image generators
[860.50 --> 862.18]  You see where i'm going with this right?
[862.18 --> 864.18]  I get it and I think the point is like that
[864.18 --> 870.18]  That everything that exists will have doubt cast on it moving forward and this is kind of the sign of that and I do agree
[870.18 --> 877.46]  Yeah, whether this is real or not the fact that so many eyes are on it and there is such a
[878.50 --> 878.90]  You know
[879.86 --> 884.50]  A lot of people that are saying one thing or the other are saying it with a certain amount of uncertainty
[885.30 --> 887.54]  Just shows that you you can't really be certain about
[888.18 --> 896.58]  Like these days remember when we were looking at sora when they announced that that big upgrade and we were watching that car racing along a track
[896.58 --> 899.30]  In all these different environments, right?
[899.86 --> 901.54]  Okay, it's it's autumn now
[902.10 --> 905.06]  It's underwater now. It's a sunny day
[906.10 --> 906.98]  It's raining
[907.86 --> 914.42]  There is absolutely no reason why I couldn't take that vogue cover shoot that vogue cover photo
[914.90 --> 921.70]  And be like okay, it's overcast today. Can you adjust my lighting based on that that is well within the capabilities
[922.42 --> 924.02]  of ai image
[924.02 --> 930.34]  Alteration tools that we have today and just because they're using an older version of photoshop for something on this image
[930.58 --> 932.58]  I mean that doesn't necessarily
[935.06 --> 941.38]  Man, let's see here i'm i'm like i'm falling in i'm falling into the trap to someone metadata for a file to my knowledge
[942.10 --> 947.14]  Can be altered yeah, so okay, was it shot on a five?
[947.70 --> 953.70]  5d whatever mark whatever my okay, my pushback on that is if they would go that far
[954.10 --> 960.50]  I feel like they would have done a better job touching up things like her hair and other various like it is confusing isn't it?
[961.22 --> 964.02]  It's honestly like a poorly done photoshop job
[964.02 --> 969.62]  It raises all it raises a whole other layer of questions because here's my first question right?
[969.70 --> 975.86]  So we talked about already that this is someone who is a public figure and is accustomed to public appearances. Yeah
[975.86 --> 982.66]  Why in god's name would you pick the cover of a vogue magazine?
[983.14 --> 986.58]  As your picture as your as your choice for the mother's day picture?
[987.86 --> 989.70]  Oh, yeah, like out of the out of the
[990.26 --> 991.46]  options out of the mountain
[991.46 --> 995.94]  I don't think that that's necessarily it though because like you said they might have used a variety of other images as well
[995.94 --> 998.74]  That's just that's just her i'm taking a photo face
[999.46 --> 1002.98]  Um, like let's see what's her name kate middleton. Hey, um
[1005.62 --> 1007.62]  Images
[1007.62 --> 1012.82]  Okay, so you're basically looking to see oh man, he's going to sleuth mode. Do you have a photo taking face?
[1014.02 --> 1017.14]  A lot of these are candid. Yeah, which means no
[1017.94 --> 1019.94]  um
[1019.94 --> 1023.46]  I don't know how old this photo is down and right is not candid
[1024.58 --> 1030.10]  You we went i mean it just meant down and right from where your mouse was that's no left. Oh my god
[1030.98 --> 1037.14]  Down this one down this one. Yes. Oh, that's not candid. That looks quite old though
[1039.38 --> 1041.86]  It's very similar to it's similar ish
[1041.86 --> 1046.42]  I wouldn't say it's nearly as similar as the the similar ones agreed
[1046.42 --> 1051.14]  I saw I saw another one when I was uh when I was poking around in this conspiracy theory where they're like
[1051.14 --> 1054.74]  Oh, yeah, uh, there's this picture of her and the prince in a car
[1055.14 --> 1058.58]  And this picture is also ripped off of somewhere else that didn't make it into our notes
[1058.58 --> 1061.46]  I'm, not sure if that one's been debunked already or something like that
[1061.62 --> 1063.86]  I mean like this is at a completely different
[1064.50 --> 1070.34]  Hello, I got you. Did I get locked out? I don't know did I lose permissions? I don't know
[1070.82 --> 1076.18]  Uh, this one's like uh, uh an action shot and down on a weird angle. She's making the exact same smile
[1076.42 --> 1081.14]  Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I I think this is a thing. Yeah, it could be a thing
[1081.14 --> 1086.90]  But it could I think more realistically it could be like an ai generated thing you can go in and edit the metadata
[1087.54 --> 1091.86]  So why would you even bother like this is the like world's most simple
[1092.82 --> 1094.66]  ai or uh photoshop job
[1096.02 --> 1099.54]  Why would you bother with ai generation? I don't know. What's the point?
[1100.98 --> 1102.98]  luke
[1102.98 --> 1105.94]  like why there's an entire generation of people
[1107.14 --> 1114.34]  Who are you know adjusting their boobs and curving the stuff behind them and adjusting their ways generation?
[1114.58 --> 1119.22]  Adjusting their adjusting their pecs and adjusting their facial hair. I think this is everyone
[1120.26 --> 1128.98]  I I don't think this is a single generation. Okay multiple generations. Okay. I I don't think gen x is quite as into it as millennials and zoomers
[1128.98 --> 1135.22]  You don't see you don't see as much of that
[1135.54 --> 1144.02]  You see some all right you see some so so but we've got generations of people who are making what I think you would judge to be
[1144.74 --> 1146.74]  unnecessary changes to their pictures
[1148.10 --> 1149.22]  Okay
[1149.22 --> 1153.94]  All right. Yeah. Yeah, so you're asking why are they doing this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[1153.94 --> 1155.94]  I'm saying why would they use ai?
[1156.42 --> 1162.58]  Oh, I see someone just photoshopping it because yeah, that's fair if if the job because like honestly the the thing that looks
[1163.78 --> 1167.06]  To me like what might have happened is a head replacement, right? Yeah
[1168.74 --> 1175.70]  What do you mean people were doing that convincingly when I was in high school like yeah, this this is not like super advanced
[1175.70 --> 1177.54]  Yeah, you don't need ai tools to do that
[1177.54 --> 1182.66]  Why would you even bother and then when it comes out and you see these massive blurry portions?
[1182.66 --> 1184.66]  Why wouldn't you go like?
[1185.62 --> 1186.42]  Let's go
[1186.42 --> 1190.50]  Let's go one layer deeper into the conspiracy war in here sure
[1191.78 --> 1193.86]  They did it to make us talk about it
[1194.90 --> 1198.26]  See that's sick. I like that a lot. I don't think so
[1199.14 --> 1204.34]  I don't think so I don't think so I think my favorite comment about that that I saw from someone
[1204.34 --> 1209.78]  I forget who was like yeah, maybe if the queen was still in charge, but realistically the rest of these guys are a bunch of bumbling
[1209.78 --> 1213.54]  Idiots. There's no way they had that much game sense that honestly sounds very real
[1214.50 --> 1215.46]  I don't know
[1215.46 --> 1219.38]  That's the thing is I I I legitimately don't pay that much attention
[1219.38 --> 1225.30]  I just saw this trending and I was like, okay, this is very interesting and I think it's a it's a really fascinating topic of conversation
[1227.94 --> 1229.70]  Have you gotten any king cash yet?
[1230.42 --> 1232.42]  King cash. Yeah, what's king cash?
[1232.42 --> 1235.94]  Canadian dollars with the king on them. Oh god
[1236.74 --> 1238.74]  Unless it's Mufasa. I'm not interested
[1239.86 --> 1244.58]  I haven't gotten any king cash yet. Are we printing king cash? Yeah. Oh, man
[1244.58 --> 1246.42]  I guess we would have had to eventually I
[1246.42 --> 1251.54]  I kind of thought maybe we could stall until he dies and then that's interesting too is your passport says
[1252.18 --> 1257.06]  From the queen. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Oh, no, I have to get a new one. I don't know
[1257.06 --> 1262.02]  I guess it's gonna be maybe I guess it's they all expire now like what I don't know
[1262.42 --> 1267.46]  I I'd like I was I was like I swear it says from the queen and I checked my own passport and was like yep
[1268.18 --> 1270.18]  My passport is authorized
[1270.58 --> 1276.42]  By someone who isn't alive anymore. How does that work? I have no idea like Canadian passports
[1277.30 --> 1279.30]  effectively say
[1279.30 --> 1282.18]  The queen says this person can travel
[1282.82 --> 1288.02]  Please allow them to travel that's like effectively, you know, it's much longer than that and written cool
[1288.02 --> 1289.06]  um, but like
[1290.26 --> 1296.66]  Man, what does that mean now dude? I gotta say with the with the the gap in both time and
[1297.38 --> 1299.78]  societal and technological advancement
[1300.34 --> 1303.62]  between queen elizabeth the seconds coronation and
[1305.62 --> 1307.62]  King charles's coronation
[1307.62 --> 1309.62]  I
[1309.62 --> 1312.98]  I dipped in for about 30 seconds
[1313.94 --> 1317.62]  Of just highlight clips of the whole thing
[1318.58 --> 1320.58]  And I was just kind of like
[1322.02 --> 1324.02]  Robin Williams jumanji
[1324.26 --> 1325.78]  What year is it?
[1325.78 --> 1327.38]  Yeah, like it just it felt
[1328.02 --> 1329.22]  So
[1329.22 --> 1331.78]  Bizarre and out of place. It felt like fiction
[1331.78 --> 1338.66]  It felt like a scene in a in a movie about a time long past and a kingdom long ago like the whole thing
[1339.38 --> 1340.34]  felt
[1340.34 --> 1341.22]  so
[1341.22 --> 1346.26]  Silly the I the idea of you know god ordaining a monarch that whatever it's like
[1346.66 --> 1352.74]  Yeah, we we moved past that so long ago like she reigned for like 70 years or something like that
[1352.74 --> 1359.06]  Yeah, and so much has changed in that time that it just the whole thing felt so silly like my entire life
[1359.62 --> 1366.18]  I just kind of accepted. Yeah, like queen elizabeth or whatever she lives in a in a castle somewhere and she's on our money and
[1366.98 --> 1368.26]  You know, I mean
[1368.26 --> 1370.82]  Honestly when she was younger, she's kind of hot so like whatever
[1370.82 --> 1374.90]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm just trying to get it
[1374.90 --> 1379.06]  I'm just trying to get a rise. I took a second from to process that because I was reading apparently
[1379.22 --> 1381.22]  Canada unveils a new passport
[1381.22 --> 1385.30]  Okay, more security features and a nod to King Charles. Okay, so we'll have a look at that in a second
[1385.30 --> 1388.10]  The point is just like it never it never really occurred to me
[1388.10 --> 1391.94]  It was just a normal thing that I didn't think about yeah, like yeah, the Queen's on the money who cares?
[1392.10 --> 1397.22]  Yeah, but then now that it's changing. I'm sitting here going why don't you put Terry Fox on the money?
[1397.22 --> 1403.46]  Please what please please what put Terry Fox? Yeah, put Terry Fox on the money. Yeah, that'd be way good
[1403.62 --> 1407.06]  Speaking of which the most based Canadian thing. Okay. Do you know about this?
[1407.78 --> 1412.58]  I don't know whether they were watching when show or not Terry Fox foundation reached out. No way. Yeah
[1413.14 --> 1414.66]  That's pretty sick. So we're okay
[1415.54 --> 1418.58]  No promises in terms of the depth of the collaboration
[1419.06 --> 1422.90]  Um, but don't don't worry about that. Don't speculate anything. I don't want people to get the wrong idea
[1422.90 --> 1423.46]  All right, all right, all right
[1423.46 --> 1428.74]  But at the very least you and I are gonna wear Terry Fox foundation shirts for a WAN show sick
[1428.82 --> 1433.54]  So that we've got locked in as part of a part of a campaign that they're doing in collaboration with Ryan Reynolds
[1433.54 --> 1438.90]  They basically want awesome any Canadian that has any kind of audience to wear our Terry Fox foundation shirt
[1438.90 --> 1440.66]  So we're gonna wear some shirts and then
[1441.46 --> 1443.46]  If we can do anything
[1443.46 --> 1447.94]  A little bit deeper than then we will where we'd be very excited to do something like that
[1447.94 --> 1455.54]  Yeah, yeah, I was like I got like two emails in a row one was from some ai company that I have wanted to collaborate with
[1455.54 --> 1459.06]  And that was and then five minutes later I heard from the Terry Fox foundation. I'm like this is a good day
[1459.78 --> 1464.66]  This is a pretty good day. My phone's blowing up for all the right reasons. Yeah, those are good days. Yeah, I'm really excited. Yeah
[1464.90 --> 1466.34]  um
[1466.42 --> 1469.30]  Now we'll tell it we'll tell you that we'll tell you the story of Terry Fox man
[1469.30 --> 1473.62]  It feels like it almost feels like you can tell that story as many times as as you want, right?
[1473.62 --> 1477.70]  It's like it's it's a bedtime story. Dad, you tell me the story of Terry Fox. Yeah
[1477.70 --> 1479.94]  Okay, for sure. We'll tell you the story of Terry Fox again
[1479.94 --> 1484.90]  But we're gonna wait until we've got the shirts and we can tell you a little bit about what the foundation is doing these days
[1484.90 --> 1486.98]  I'm good. I'm very excited. Yeah, um
[1487.78 --> 1492.34]  Anyway, okay, let's have a look at the new passport. You want to show me the new passport sure? All right. Yeah
[1493.22 --> 1495.22]  There's a front
[1495.86 --> 1499.06]  There's the inside. Okay, cool. There's some corn that looks like
[1500.34 --> 1506.34]  Is it actually gonna be colored like that? I don't know. I honestly I'm kind of into it. How do you put the stamps there though? I don't know
[1507.86 --> 1511.14]  Oh, maybe there's like alternate. Oh, here we go. Yeah. Yeah. There's the interior. Yeah
[1515.94 --> 1516.98]  Hmm
[1517.22 --> 1519.38]  There's a surprising lack of like
[1520.50 --> 1522.50]  Canadian native imagery
[1524.50 --> 1526.50]  I think that's Canadian native imagery
[1527.14 --> 1529.14]  Is it?
[1529.14 --> 1531.14]  I think so
[1531.14 --> 1533.38]  These just look like school kids in like rubber boots
[1534.18 --> 1535.30]  Um
[1535.30 --> 1536.98]  I doubt it
[1536.98 --> 1538.98]  All right
[1539.86 --> 1540.42]  Okay
[1540.42 --> 1541.46]  Anyway, um
[1542.10 --> 1545.86]  Wow, this seems so unnecessary other than I guess that it says
[1546.66 --> 1548.26]  The queen in our passport. Yeah
[1549.62 --> 1550.26]  Cool
[1550.26 --> 1552.26]  Should we jump into our next topic?
[1552.26 --> 1552.58]  Sure
[1552.58 --> 1554.42]  Cars spying on us?
[1554.42 --> 1555.14]  Yeah
[1555.14 --> 1555.62]  Yeah
[1555.62 --> 1556.50]  Okay, do you know about this?
[1556.50 --> 1558.50]  I didn't until I read this thing
[1558.50 --> 1560.10]  Okay, let's let's hear about it
[1560.10 --> 1562.34]  Some car manufacturers including acura
[1562.34 --> 1564.18]  Ugh, except it won't affect my car
[1564.18 --> 1566.10]  Uh, gm honda honda
[1566.82 --> 1570.58]  Acura and honda interesting. Okay. I mean that's the same company, but it sounds good
[1570.74 --> 1573.78]  Um, and I and mitsubishi have optional
[1574.10 --> 1581.46]  Gamified features in their connected car apps to track the rate the users driving track and rate track and rate
[1581.46 --> 1582.50]  Okay, I was like what?
[1582.50 --> 1584.50]  Uh, track and rate the users driving
[1584.50 --> 1589.86]  These are often framed as coaching apps to improve driving safety and award users with points for good driving
[1590.26 --> 1594.98]  Which is actually kind of neat. It's driving kind of boring. So if you can try to do that. That's cool
[1595.54 --> 1597.06]  I like ways for that
[1597.06 --> 1601.22]  Like I I like reporting things and I get points for it and stuff. It doesn't matter, but oh, yeah
[1601.22 --> 1603.06]  Yeah, I like it driving so boring
[1603.06 --> 1605.06]  It also tells me when there are cops
[1606.90 --> 1614.42]  Nice, um according to a report from the new york times these car companies sell information from these apps to data brokers
[1614.42 --> 1620.50]  Which then sell it to insurers who use that in their determination of a driver's premium
[1621.22 --> 1624.26]  Womp womp. It's like selling your medical data
[1624.82 --> 1631.78]  According to a work to according to workers at gm the revenue from the onstar smart driver app is in the low
[1631.78 --> 1633.78]  Millions of dollars
[1634.02 --> 1639.62]  Further some gm drivers were were tracked despite never having enabled any of those tracking features
[1639.94 --> 1646.02]  One cadillac owner who said he was not aware of onstar smart driver found himself denied insurance
[1646.02 --> 1653.54]  By seven different insurance companies before learning that his vehicle had been sending data that he was often braking or accelerating hard
[1653.54 --> 1655.54]  As well as engaging in some speeding
[1655.54 --> 1659.70]  Heaven forbid they see my driving I was just gonna say
[1660.18 --> 1663.94]  Neither of us would ever get insurance again, which would be a problem
[1665.22 --> 1671.06]  I would definitely get insurance and I would never bring to work and I would never drive with hard braking or hard
[1671.06 --> 1673.30]  I would never get insurance again because my acceleration my
[1673.30 --> 1679.22]  My discount would bring me to zero dollars because I drive perfectly. Yep, and there would be no it would break the system
[1679.22 --> 1683.30]  Yes, it would break the system and there would be no there'd be no way for him to get insurance
[1683.78 --> 1690.58]  Such a such a shame scout's honor. I just drive too well. Yeah, me too. I'd have to go out there and
[1691.22 --> 1695.78]  Unfortunately intentionally speed in like an abandoned parking lot or something just to be able to
[1696.42 --> 1698.58]  Get into yeah, just to seem human. Yeah
[1699.54 --> 1701.54]  unfortunate agreed
[1702.10 --> 1709.94]  According to GM it shares select insights with data brokers, but customers agree to share their data when they sign the user agreement other manufacturers
[1709.94 --> 1715.86]  Such as Kia say they require additional explicit consent from owners before sharing such information
[1716.10 --> 1722.34]  Meanwhile, the finished transport and communications agency has detected. Oh, this is a separate topic. Yeah, I was just gonna say what?
[1722.34 --> 1730.34]  uh, so let's talk about this yeah remember when I was talking about how this whole 23andme data breach thing and
[1731.70 --> 1735.14]  I went off on this thing about how anything to do with your dna
[1735.78 --> 1740.90]  Is going to impact your insurance at some point if you're american and you should basically be
[1741.86 --> 1746.02]  caring about this a lot and people were like yeah, but the laws and it's
[1746.02 --> 1754.02]  Like a not insignificant number of people were treating me like I was some kind of tinfoil hat conspiracy nut or something like that
[1754.82 --> 1755.38]  guys
[1755.38 --> 1759.38]  Do you think the law matters to the people who are?
[1760.02 --> 1761.38]  Excuse me
[1761.38 --> 1763.38]  Handling your data?
[1764.18 --> 1766.18]  Do you think they care about the law?
[1766.18 --> 1770.18]  What punishment is there for this?
[1771.06 --> 1772.74]  No, one's even talking about that
[1774.10 --> 1776.18]  As far as I can tell there isn't any
[1777.62 --> 1779.54]  There's no consequences
[1779.54 --> 1781.78]  And even if there is it'll be a tiny slap on the wrist
[1782.42 --> 1785.86]  Exactly and you've got to understand like these are things that
[1785.86 --> 1794.34]  This didn't just this isn't like oh one car manufacturer was talking about this and a whistleblower was like
[1794.34 --> 1796.90]  Oh, let's make sure this never happens. We got to inform the pop
[1797.94 --> 1805.22]  Multiple car manufacturers of the biggest ones are running these programs and making millions of dollars on the sale of your data
[1807.86 --> 1808.10]  Yeah
[1808.10 --> 1815.62]  And like I my brain goes to like okay, maybe if they were only allowed to offer discounts based on good driving
[1816.18 --> 1820.34]  Maybe they weren't allowed to do anything else, but then they just shift the prices up
[1820.34 --> 1826.42]  No, no, then what they do is they use an ai learning model
[1827.14 --> 1828.74]  And they basically tell it
[1829.86 --> 1836.26]  Determine the appropriate premium for everyone and when the regulators come knocking they go well, I don't know how it works
[1836.26 --> 1844.58]  It's a black box and it goes oh speaking of which couldn't help noticing that you deny insurance to anyone with a certain skin color
[1844.58 --> 1845.86]  Well, I mean
[1846.66 --> 1847.78]  We have no way of knowing
[1849.78 --> 1851.46]  That's the that's going to be the defense
[1852.42 --> 1855.38]  100 times out of 100 they're just going to hide behind
[1855.86 --> 1858.34]  I just left the train on the tracks exactly
[1858.42 --> 1859.86]  Yeah
[1859.86 --> 1864.02]  Yeah, I mean we don't we don't I mean there is no good way keep old dumb cars
[1864.02 --> 1870.74]  And you know what and you got to understand how powerful insurance companies are now like all they have to do is say well
[1871.46 --> 1876.02]  The alternative is we're just going to not cover anyone in your state and they walk away
[1876.02 --> 1876.98]  Yeah, which is happen
[1876.98 --> 1882.74]  And don't imagine they won't it's happening right now people trying to get home insurance in freaking florida
[1883.22 --> 1884.26]  It's a struggle
[1885.46 --> 1887.46]  It's a huge struggle
[1887.46 --> 1892.42]  And so you know, you look at this and you go. Oh, yeah, well, here's the here's the safeguards. We could put them
[1892.42 --> 1896.58]  No, as soon as this data exists, it will be exploited
[1897.54 --> 1899.70]  Like honestly, I'm on the one hand
[1899.70 --> 1906.18]  I was happy to not see volkswagen on the list because I drive a fancy volkswagen essentially
[1906.18 --> 1909.14]  They own a bunch of cars or a bunch of car companies
[1909.86 --> 1910.90]  and
[1910.90 --> 1913.46]  If I had to if there was you know
[1914.02 --> 1917.46]  A short list of brands that I would think are just going to be like yeah
[1917.46 --> 1923.54]  And just be all driving experience all the time and we'll just charge more for the cars to keep ourselves profitable
[1923.94 --> 1925.94]  Porsche would probably be on that list
[1926.90 --> 1927.78]  Dodge
[1927.78 --> 1928.82]  But on the other hand
[1930.10 --> 1932.10]  I don't really trust anybody
[1932.10 --> 1932.34]  No
[1932.34 --> 1935.70]  At all not when there's not when there's millions of dollars at play
[1936.10 --> 1937.54]  Like is this even conclusive?
[1937.54 --> 1940.74]  Do they know this is all the companies or is this the ones that they know about?
[1941.06 --> 1941.94]  That I don't know
[1941.94 --> 1945.54]  A scathing report from the new york times so like
[1946.66 --> 1949.22]  It's possible that some companies just didn't get caught
[1952.10 --> 1952.82]  Issa maybe
[1955.94 --> 1958.26]  Yeah, yeah, I wonder what gdpr thinks about this
[1959.30 --> 1963.22]  I don't know. I mean it's possible they're not collecting the data there. It's also possible they're just
[1963.54 --> 1967.46]  Collecting it surreptitiously and doing nothing with it while they while they bide their time
[1967.94 --> 1974.34]  Like that's that's the thing is the the number of okay, you know what i'd love to hear your thoughts on this
[1975.54 --> 1978.02]  If there was a data collection program like this
[1979.06 --> 1986.74]  How many people like with with beating hearts and functioning lungs like how many human beings would have to know about it?
[1988.74 --> 1992.26]  You get what I mean, right? So everyone could know about the gamified thing
[1992.26 --> 1995.54]  But how many people would have to know?
[1996.26 --> 1998.10]  About this database not very many
[1998.90 --> 2000.50]  Because you could collect it all
[2002.58 --> 2005.22]  And not tell the people that are collecting it that you're selling it
[2006.50 --> 2010.10]  So yeah, not very many very few give me a number
[2011.46 --> 2018.10]  Obviously at the at the ceo level yeah, we're getting the we're getting into company scales that i'm not used to operating in
[2018.10 --> 2020.10]  You'd have your top sales execs
[2020.66 --> 2024.26]  They would know your top it execs would know
[2024.90 --> 2029.30]  So you've got at least a half a dozen right there and then probably a couple
[2030.18 --> 2032.18]  Not you know top execs
[2032.74 --> 2034.58]  But trusted it people
[2037.22 --> 2039.54]  So I don't know you're probably dealing with 20 or less
[2041.14 --> 2046.02]  But again, we're we're dealing with company scales that I have I have no real understanding of so i'm not really sure
[2046.02 --> 2052.90]  The fact that they're able to tie this to an individual person is mind-blowing to me one of my sorry if it was aggregate
[2053.06 --> 2056.58]  If it was aggregate then i'm kind of looking at it going yeah
[2056.58 --> 2062.26]  What do you expect was going to happen but the fact that this can be tied to an individual operator of the vehicle?
[2062.98 --> 2065.38]  Absolutely. Oh, yeah blows me away right now
[2066.02 --> 2072.26]  Like this is a next level betrayal and a fun little pass time i've been doing recently is looking at surprising
[2073.14 --> 2075.38]  employee counts at various companies
[2076.02 --> 2083.06]  And this is part of my like, I don't really know dude because i'll look at like some company that has basically
[2083.54 --> 2086.90]  They have like one software function that they make and they sell
[2087.46 --> 2092.74]  I usually find this isn't b2b but they sell it for whatever they make effectively one thing
[2093.06 --> 2097.30]  it like pretty much hasn't changed over the course of like five years and then
[2097.86 --> 2099.94]  You're like, I don't know this probably runs on like
[2100.50 --> 2102.98]  five to fifty employees and then it's like
[2103.78 --> 2106.58]  fifteen hundred and you're like what like
[2108.74 --> 2112.50]  What do you all do like is this like 20 engineers and
[2113.06 --> 2116.02]  fourteen hundred and eighty sales people are like how does this work
[2116.02 --> 2121.38]  The wily says it sounds like they're tying it to the vin not to a person and that's fair enough
[2121.38 --> 2123.06]  But the number of people
[2123.38 --> 2129.38]  Driving a particular vin is generally going to be num is going to be in the air in the range of one to three
[2129.38 --> 2130.26]  Yeah, you know
[2131.06 --> 2136.34]  I'm talking like, you know two heads of household and you know one kid maybe you know
[2136.34 --> 2141.14]  Maybe four or maybe a roommate or whatever else it's you can count them on one hand and
[2141.14 --> 2146.26]  And because you're tracking all that you're tracking the cars driving characteristics
[2146.74 --> 2150.10]  You can probably fingerprint them to a degree honestly, yeah
[2150.74 --> 2154.98]  Without much effort because you probably got geo location information as well
[2155.54 --> 2158.34]  So okay these data brokers a lot of what they do is
[2158.82 --> 2164.02]  Oh, all this information is you know not identifiable except it's extremely fingerprintable
[2164.02 --> 2169.14]  And we buy it from all of the different services so we can tie it all together and build a nice little stack
[2169.14 --> 2174.90]  And it's it might not be like, you know, we know this person's exact name although a lot of cases they would
[2175.30 --> 2178.66]  Um, but it it might be like this is you know
[2179.38 --> 2182.26]  This is information we have on this type of a person. Yeah
[2183.46 --> 2190.82]  And then this is the type of person this is so rather than being individuals you sort them into buckets. Yeah, so that's a way to kind of
[2191.94 --> 2194.82]  And those buckets can get ever narrower and narrower and narrower
[2195.22 --> 2198.74]  So but as long as they don't make it all the way to one person well, then you're compliant
[2198.74 --> 2201.54]  Yeah, we don't know what the box does yuck
[2202.02 --> 2206.90]  Um rob the tank says insurance analyst here our models are getting really good
[2207.14 --> 2213.14]  So this data matters, uh, what's scary is the next step for the big companies is tying it to financial databases
[2215.86 --> 2219.46]  What would that mean charging based on your like income
[2219.46 --> 2224.18]  That's kind of a scary one is that what that would mean
[2224.82 --> 2231.46]  Why I could see it so I could see that going a number of different ways. Um, I could see that going to
[2232.66 --> 2233.06]  um
[2234.02 --> 2235.86]  It what what it sounded like to me
[2236.66 --> 2238.26]  Was that he was saying that
[2239.70 --> 2242.26]  Shoot where was I going with this crap crap crap crap crap
[2242.26 --> 2246.66]  You make money elijah shush um
[2247.62 --> 2249.70]  Crap crap crap financial databases
[2250.34 --> 2255.14]  Ah, whatever there was there there was somewhere that I was going with that, but I forget oh, yeah, okay
[2255.14 --> 2260.02]  Yeah, mcxl says okay, so they could already charge more or less based on your credit score
[2260.58 --> 2262.58]  oh my god
[2262.58 --> 2266.18]  Why does your credit score affect your insurance rates like an abstracted thing?
[2266.18 --> 2271.54]  I actually I I can't really understand that me neither, but doesn't make any sense
[2271.54 --> 2276.26]  I don't think i've ever been credit scored for my insurance. Is that an american thing? It could be
[2277.38 --> 2281.30]  I know americans like are more on the whole credit score thing than we are
[2282.34 --> 2283.46]  so maybe
[2283.46 --> 2287.30]  Uh, it's hurley time says insurance underwriter here models are getting really good
[2287.30 --> 2290.98]  But the industry has been losing money on auto for more than the last 10 years at least in the us, which
[2291.54 --> 2296.10]  Doesn't surprise me at all actually and that's that's where we got to that point
[2296.18 --> 2299.78]  That I was making about how if you try to clamp down on this behavior
[2300.10 --> 2301.62]  They're basically going to come back and say okay
[2301.62 --> 2305.14]  Well, then we're not insuring a single vehicle in your entire state. We're going to just walk away
[2305.70 --> 2306.90]  And you're going to kind of go oh, um
[2308.18 --> 2311.46]  We kind of need that because it's it will be pandemonium
[2312.10 --> 2318.34]  Especially in a place where health care is covered by insurance not by universal health care
[2318.98 --> 2320.42]  Right, it would it
[2320.58 --> 2323.78]  It would be like the destruction people would be afraid to drive
[2324.50 --> 2328.66]  If they knew that not only like if if you couldn't if you couldn't get insurance
[2329.14 --> 2332.34]  And if you didn't know for sure if the other drivers had insurance
[2332.74 --> 2338.10]  Like I I saw some people in chat earlier complaining about how auto insurance is mandatory at all
[2338.10 --> 2340.10]  It's like it's not for you brother. Yeah
[2340.74 --> 2341.62]  It's for the person
[2341.62 --> 2348.10]  I really want you to have auto insurance. Yeah, like i'm sorry because but I actually don't care about your feelings here
[2348.10 --> 2351.86]  And that's a fact you need automotive insurance because
[2354.26 --> 2355.38]  You need it
[2355.38 --> 2358.90]  It's it's not for you and it may benefit you
[2359.70 --> 2364.58]  But it's not really for you. Yeah, it's to cover your butt. Yep
[2364.58 --> 2367.06]  When you whack into someone else's car
[2367.70 --> 2371.22]  Yeah, electro bot says nationalized slash socialized insurance
[2371.22 --> 2372.02]  So
[2373.30 --> 2379.94]  Also, no to be honest as a place where um, we kind of have this weird public private partnership
[2380.50 --> 2382.90]  Insurance monopoly for automotive insurance
[2383.70 --> 2385.30]  It's not perfect. Yeah
[2386.50 --> 2389.06]  I would even go as far as to say there have been times when it's been
[2389.86 --> 2393.86]  Pretty catastrophically bad. So yeah, no
[2393.86 --> 2395.86]  Yeah
[2396.98 --> 2400.58]  Is insurance a tax write-off? No, but well it can be
[2401.38 --> 2409.30]  I know it can be but but what's always a tax write-off is our special merch item for the week. Okay, wait, what?
[2410.02 --> 2411.30]  So, luke
[2412.10 --> 2417.70]  I don't understand was trying to understand this before the show. Why don't we we're gonna jump on lttstore.com
[2418.18 --> 2423.06]  We're gonna jump on lttstore.com. Okay, no, not only do I not understand it. I don't understand it in
[2423.86 --> 2424.74]  Multiple ways
[2425.38 --> 2431.54]  This is the tax write-off shirt. Yeah, this shirt is a tax write-off. It actually contains
[2432.26 --> 2435.54]  The full text of the tax write-off rent
[2436.26 --> 2442.98]  Um, which is sick. I like that. Yep. It's not it's not an infinite money glitch. Okay, guys, this is how it works
[2442.98 --> 2448.98]  Okay, we've got a we've got a ripped up hundred dollar ltt bill with um, a dead queen on it
[2449.46 --> 2451.70]  Or sorry, wait. No, they know they're American
[2451.70 --> 2456.74]  They keep the same people on their money. I know it's an American bill. It's benjamin franklin
[2458.42 --> 2463.70]  Doesn't matter the point is that we have the tax write-off shirt. So luke you had some questions about the tax
[2463.70 --> 2466.02]  right-off. Okay. Yeah, let's start with the uh
[2466.02 --> 2472.10]  The like less related ones sure and the less important. Yeah, absolutely why pink and periwinkle. Well, it's a write-off
[2472.82 --> 2474.90]  Okay, yeah, the corporations they're writing it off
[2475.62 --> 2480.34]  So it's because we have extra of those colors of shirts, but it's because we're gonna write them off
[2481.22 --> 2484.74]  Okay, so here's my here's where the root of it comes at. Yeah
[2484.74 --> 2488.42]  We already sell this is I'm not even trying to pump us up
[2488.66 --> 2491.30]  We sell relatively cheap shirts like if you look at other
[2491.86 --> 2496.02]  Creator merch, I think our shirts are generally superior and also cheaper
[2496.66 --> 2500.82]  Yes, why are we selling one that's 50% of that so that we can write it off?
[2501.78 --> 2503.78]  How does that what?
[2504.34 --> 2508.98]  Is this actually a strategy? It's a write-off. Are we I were so we're actually doing that we're
[2508.98 --> 2514.50]  We're we're just setting a really bad price and then writing off the like losses on it
[2515.46 --> 2517.46]  I mean, that's how write-offs work
[2517.86 --> 2520.58]  It's not a way of making money luke. It's right on the shirt
[2522.18 --> 2524.58]  Right at the very bottom of the shirt look do I need to remind you
[2525.14 --> 2530.58]  The entire rant is here, but why it's not why did we decide to not make money?
[2530.58 --> 2536.58]  It's not a way of making more money actively decide and okay because that's not how that works
[2536.58 --> 2540.10]  Okay, so here's the here's the the thing that really grinds my gears. Yes
[2540.10 --> 2544.58]  You wanna do tell me remember this story that we talked about about
[2544.98 --> 2548.74]  I think it was last week like why Nick got hired. Mm-hmm
[2551.38 --> 2552.50]  Yeah
[2552.66 --> 2558.90]  For what I don't know what you're talking about because of like business decisions that don't make the company money right made by you
[2558.90 --> 2563.22]  But we're gonna write it off and then Nick runs create a warehouse. Yeah, this isn't gonna make money
[2563.22 --> 2566.90]  No, but we're gonna write it off. What's going on? We're writing it off luke
[2571.38 --> 2579.94]  Imagine we had a single nba that worked here. I think they just freak out. I think they just run out screaming. It's like what are you guys doing?
[2580.82 --> 2582.82]  What's wrong with you?
[2584.58 --> 2587.86]  Why do we do this stuff like do you have any more questions
[2590.58 --> 2592.58]  Dan, do you have any questions?
[2594.18 --> 2596.18]  Uh, how long until they're gonna ship?
[2597.38 --> 2603.14]  Oh, uh, usually you get a bulk discount on all the external auditing that's gonna happen to happen to you
[2603.14 --> 2606.98]  Uh, it'll be available until yeah, that too. Are we just asking for it?
[2607.54 --> 2609.30]  Uh, they should be shipped by april 12th
[2609.30 --> 2615.86]  Like raise any flags that we sold a shirt for less than ten dollars when like no one does that and then wrote it off
[2615.86 --> 2617.86]  Like are they not gonna be like hey?
[2617.86 --> 2625.78]  Um, actually you have a history of selling t-shirts for 20 bucks a very long and fairly unbroken history
[2625.78 --> 2629.86]  Of selling t-shirts for 20 dollars. Why did you price it like this?
[2629.86 --> 2631.70]  Uh, so that we could write it off
[2631.70 --> 2632.82]  Oh
[2632.82 --> 2634.82]  You're gonna tell the government that?
[2634.82 --> 2635.78]  Yeah, isn't that bad?
[2635.78 --> 2636.34]  No
[2636.34 --> 2638.18]  It's completely
[2638.90 --> 2640.02]  Above board. Yes
[2641.38 --> 2644.10]  We're gonna write it off. Okay. Do you have any other questions?
[2645.54 --> 2647.38]  I think you were wondering about the colors before
[2648.10 --> 2650.82]  Why why can't I achieve escape velocity?
[2650.82 --> 2653.86]  Can you help me with this pink and pink and periwinkle?
[2653.86 --> 2655.54]  Uh, what you had questions about that?
[2655.54 --> 2659.78]  What's the fastest and easiest way to achieve escape velocity escape velocity?
[2659.78 --> 2660.66]  Yeah
[2660.66 --> 2661.46]  On what?
[2661.46 --> 2662.74]  The planet
[2662.74 --> 2667.86]  The planet. Oh, oh, I see. No, no, no, no. I'd like to address your question about the colors. All right. Yeah
[2668.58 --> 2670.34]  Well, it's so that we can write them off
[2671.30 --> 2674.50]  Were they more expensive than like normal colors?
[2675.46 --> 2675.70]  No
[2677.22 --> 2680.98]  No, but they're great for writing off. I think because we have too many of them, dan. I think
[2683.38 --> 2687.70]  No, but that would that would be that would be an astute business decision and it doesn't seem like that happens here anymore
[2687.70 --> 2692.58]  Um, so i'm gonna go through our notes in the doc here on the tax write-off sale
[2692.98 --> 2698.18]  Uh, you've seen the memes and now you can buy the memes for yourselves. The shirt is ten dollars
[2698.58 --> 2699.78]  In the words- Why?
[2699.78 --> 2701.78]  In the words of linus sebastian
[2701.78 --> 2708.10]  A tax write-off is not a way of making more f***ing money and neither is this sale because we are losing money on it
[2708.10 --> 2709.86]  What? Why?
[2709.86 --> 2714.58]  The shirt is a tax write-off. Do you know how much it costs to get a shirt printed at our printer?
[2715.78 --> 2716.98]  It's ten dollars, isn't it?
[2716.98 --> 2722.90]  It's it no, but it's multiple dollars. It's it's multiple dollars. There's also shipping and handling. They gotta pick it
[2723.14 --> 2728.90]  Every time they pick it. All right. I'm just trying to feel out how much money we're gonna lose on this enough to write off
[2730.26 --> 2737.94]  Not only is the shirt only ten dollars, but we have decided to fire sale our remaining 30 by 30 cpu pillows
[2737.94 --> 2741.78]  And color block hoodies for just 14.99
[2742.26 --> 2742.82]  Now go ahead
[2742.82 --> 2744.26]  Wait, the hoodies are 14.99?
[2744.26 --> 2745.70]  Go ahead, you can ask me
[2746.90 --> 2748.18]  What's up with the pricing?
[2749.06 --> 2751.06]  Of the color block hoodie
[2751.62 --> 2753.06]  Was that with 70 dollars?
[2753.78 --> 2755.86]  Go back up to the- Oh my god. Here we go
[2755.86 --> 2760.66]  So the the tech linked color block hoodie go ahead and ask me about this price. Why did we choose this price?
[2762.18 --> 2763.78]  Why did we choose that?
[2763.78 --> 2764.98]  So that we could write it off
[2766.42 --> 2768.42]  They're taking up too much warehouse space
[2769.06 --> 2770.66]  It's the tax write-off sale
[2770.66 --> 2772.66]  Oh
[2773.46 --> 2775.54]  Oh, there's even more merch messages now
[2777.70 --> 2783.70]  We're not gonna be able to get to them all today, but enjoy your enjoy your tax write-off shirt hoodie and cpu pillow
[2785.62 --> 2790.42]  The merch messages per minute wow the rate at which we're losing money is actually sort of incredible
[2791.86 --> 2793.86]  No, we're not losing money
[2793.86 --> 2800.90]  It's funny because like my dashboard taryn taryn goes on vacation for one week and this happens
[2802.02 --> 2803.14]  Luke's still gonna get his paycheck
[2804.02 --> 2805.06]  While taryn was gone
[2805.86 --> 2806.74]  Is taryn gone?
[2807.38 --> 2810.10]  Well, he's not here. No, I think I think I just made that up. Okay. I was like
[2810.10 --> 2815.06]  I know he flew somewhere yesterday. I think yeah, but I had to get a new job because his company's going down
[2815.06 --> 2817.70]  I didn't even call them. I had lunch with him this week. So I was like, how did he?
[2818.74 --> 2820.74]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Luke
[2820.74 --> 2826.90]  Uh, s004aws says also don't forget that retro screwdriver still gets you free shipping on your entire order
[2830.26 --> 2832.10]  Yeah, that code's still active why
[2833.70 --> 2837.14]  So that we can write it off luke. Oh my are you thick?
[2837.70 --> 2839.70]  But how long how long is this?
[2839.70 --> 2840.34]  I'm not sure
[2841.30 --> 2843.30]  Until we can write it off
[2843.54 --> 2846.34]  Okay, okay, so in all seriousness
[2846.34 --> 2852.82]  To explain you know what why we're writing these off. Okay, it's to make a point
[2854.42 --> 2857.86]  I wanted to demonstrate how a write-off works
[2858.58 --> 2861.94]  A write-off is not a way of making money
[2862.26 --> 2868.02]  So we already addressed when I buy something right and I and I write off the cost of that
[2868.66 --> 2869.70]  I didn't I
[2869.70 --> 2874.58]  I I didn't make money magically. I personally actually make less money
[2874.90 --> 2876.98]  I have an asset that the business owns
[2877.62 --> 2881.06]  But I actually make less money so you can write off a purchase right?
[2881.06 --> 2885.70]  So that's really it's more of like a tax deduction. Okay, it's tax deductible purchases
[2886.18 --> 2888.18]  Okay, so this is
[2888.18 --> 2892.50]  More of a of a tax write-off. Okay, so you take something
[2892.50 --> 2897.14]  Let's say this water bottle that you paid let's say ten dollars for
[2898.02 --> 2900.26]  Okay, you sell it for five dollars
[2900.82 --> 2905.38]  That is at least a loss of five dollars and depending on how you do the math
[2905.38 --> 2910.82]  There could actually be greater losses associated with it in the handling the storage of the item
[2911.30 --> 2912.42]  um in the
[2913.06 --> 2917.06]  Yeah, I mean mostly mostly that I guess handling and storage of the item
[2917.06 --> 2924.90]  Um, so you could have a greater than you know five dollar loss on this on this ten dollar item that you sold for five dollars
[2925.38 --> 2926.18]  um
[2926.18 --> 2932.66]  That money that you lost be it five dollars or be it you know six or seven or whatever it whatever it adds up to
[2933.06 --> 2936.10]  Gets deducted from your net income for the year
[2937.62 --> 2942.10]  So if let's say hypothetically our entire company made
[2942.74 --> 2946.50]  $100 for the year normally we would pay about
[2947.06 --> 2950.90]  I'm rounding here, but we'd pay about a quarter of that in corporate income tax
[2951.54 --> 2954.82]  Okay, but if instead of making a hundred dollars
[2955.30 --> 2961.46]  We took that five dollars that we didn't make on that one item we sold and we deducted that from our net income
[2961.86 --> 2967.78]  Well now we made only 95 dollars and we'll owe about a quarter of that in corporate income tax
[2969.70 --> 2971.70]  We wrote it off
[2973.62 --> 2976.66]  So why would you why would you why would you go out of your way?
[2977.06 --> 2979.06]  To prove up wire?
[2979.22 --> 2981.86]  Yeah, why do you have to spend so much money to prove points?
[2982.90 --> 2984.90]  This is now a personal question
[2985.22 --> 2986.34]  um
[2986.34 --> 2991.62]  Because this is not that this is not this is not only the first time this is this is one of many
[2991.62 --> 2997.94]  Hold on a second. I'm not quite done. So so if you look at that that that write-off right all we've saved is the taxes
[2997.94 --> 2999.54]  We would have owed on five dollars
[2999.54 --> 3002.34]  So we've saved two dollars and fifty cents on our taxes
[3002.74 --> 3004.82]  But we lost five dollars plus
[3005.46 --> 3010.90]  So i'm trying to illustrate that when you lose money selling a product when you write it off
[3011.46 --> 3013.06]  You still lose money
[3014.02 --> 3015.54]  You lose money on the sale
[3016.18 --> 3020.50]  You lose money on your total net income for the year. It's like a shock absorber
[3021.86 --> 3022.66]  Yes
[3022.66 --> 3029.14]  Essentially because you're not paying you're still getting shocked you're you you you pay taxes on profit
[3029.14 --> 3035.14]  Relax, you pay taxes on profit. So if you didn't make the money, you don't pay income tax on it
[3035.94 --> 3037.94]  That's in a nutshell
[3037.94 --> 3041.30]  It's way more complicated and it but in a nutshell
[3041.86 --> 3043.14]  That's how it's
[3043.14 --> 3048.34]  Fundamentally supposed to work when something is is tax deductible or is a tax write-off
[3048.90 --> 3054.10]  Um, so why do I need to spend so much money in order to make points?
[3054.10 --> 3058.02]  Yes, and when when one of terren's major jobs is like, you know, trying to go around and
[3058.34 --> 3060.42]  improve profitability of different parts of the company
[3060.42 --> 3066.82]  Yes, do actions like this negatively reflect on his performance when you need to prove a point?
[3067.62 --> 3067.78]  um
[3068.82 --> 3070.66]  Well, if it does then he should just write it off
[3073.70 --> 3074.02]  Okay
[3074.82 --> 3081.14]  So the reason that we have to spend so much money when we want to prove a point is because we want to make a splash
[3081.14 --> 3087.14]  We want people to remember the point if we lost a hundred dollars to prove our point about tax write-offs
[3087.14 --> 3091.78]  If that had been a real one hundred dollar bill that I had destroyed nobody would have remembered that
[3092.50 --> 3094.26]  So it's but if we sold
[3095.38 --> 3096.50]  hypothetically
[3096.50 --> 3100.82]  353 tax write-off shirts while we were sitting here just now
[3101.70 --> 3106.66]  That's that's only the ones that have gone through the merch message dashboard not the ones that are sold entirely
[3106.98 --> 3112.34]  And that's already up to 360 now. That's a point that people would remember forever
[3112.34 --> 3117.30]  Now our entire audience has been educated and luke
[3118.10 --> 3123.14]  Is there any reason that we do this other than so people can learn education?
[3123.46 --> 3125.46]  Yes
[3126.82 --> 3130.98]  Consider this the investment in public education that your government won't make
[3131.54 --> 3135.46]  Can you get it and we're gonna write it off you get a charity receipt for your tax write-off?
[3136.42 --> 3138.42]  No, I can't
[3138.42 --> 3145.30]  I'm curious. I'm pulling up the real dashboard. I'm pulling up the dashboard. Okay, yeah
[3148.82 --> 3152.34]  Tax write-off shirts. Oh, okay. That number is much lower
[3154.18 --> 3156.18]  We're up to about 600 so far
[3156.42 --> 3160.26]  Yeah, because again, these are only the ones that people actually attach the merch message to
[3160.26 --> 3165.38]  Yeah, people are working on the color blog hoodies, too. We got a we go. Yeah, we got a couple hundred of those
[3165.38 --> 3167.38]  I'm seeing the arches
[3167.38 --> 3169.06]  Championing the pack right now
[3169.06 --> 3172.26]  The arches the arches we make money on hey, hey
[3172.26 --> 3177.46]  If you're buying a tax write-off item now, it's a great we'd real appreciate it
[3177.46 --> 3180.18]  Now's a great time to check out some of the arches
[3180.18 --> 3184.98]  Which by the way are not as profitable as some people seem to think they are. Oh, hey, we should probably
[3185.62 --> 3189.62]  I'm just gonna message this I saw some I saw some very interesting speculation
[3189.62 --> 3197.46]  About our arches and our cable management arches and the pricing on them and how they're they're probably only you know
[3197.94 --> 3204.34]  15 cents of plastic and and magnets or whatever else and uh, I did kind of want to talk about that a little bit on the show
[3206.74 --> 3210.02]  Something a lot of folks might not realize is that
[3211.14 --> 3214.34]  One of our whole things is that we kind of overbuild stuff
[3214.34 --> 3216.34]  Yeah, um
[3217.38 --> 3220.18]  It'd be a little difficult to not realize but I could see it. Yeah, well
[3220.18 --> 3226.34]  I mean it's one of those things where some people just you know willfully don't pay attention and there's nothing I can really do about that
[3227.54 --> 3230.50]  Those kinds of people are a write-off, but for everyone else
[3231.38 --> 3234.18]  For everyone who's willing to pay attention and willing to listen
[3234.42 --> 3239.46]  Let's talk a little bit about why our magnetic cable management arches are so expensive and why no
[3239.46 --> 3248.34]  You are not in fact going to find a cheap alternative on some other marketplace that is exactly the same for a much lower price
[3248.82 --> 3252.34]  So are you strong? Can you rip one of those magnets out of there for me?
[3252.90 --> 3257.30]  This is an early prototype of our of our extra large cable arch
[3259.46 --> 3261.46]  Now I get my finger in there. I don't know
[3261.46 --> 3263.46]  Eh
[3263.94 --> 3270.50]  What Luke's experiencing right now is the engineering work that was put into these arches to ensure that the magnets don't come out
[3271.38 --> 3272.42]  It sure doesn't want to
[3272.42 --> 3274.90]  It was actually a very difficult problem to solve
[3275.22 --> 3279.86]  This is a prototype one as well. Yeah, and not only did we solve that problem
[3280.10 --> 3282.18]  Ensuring that the magnets will not
[3282.50 --> 3288.10]  Accidentally come out of these which is really important for safety. I genuinely think my yeah, I'm bending it pretty okay
[3288.10 --> 3291.62]  I'm so sorry to have done that to you. My fingernail would come off before this did. Yeah, I have a pry tool
[3292.10 --> 3299.22]  Um, not only did we solve that problem making these safer and more and more durable
[3299.62 --> 3303.22]  But we actually did it in a way that enhances
[3303.54 --> 3305.62]  Is your pry tool just your keys? Don't worry about it
[3307.06 --> 3312.66]  I have a pry tool. I was expecting like oh wow they like made something for this. It's just this key
[3313.38 --> 3318.74]  But we did it in a way that actually enhances their magnetic pull strength. Oh cool. So uh, jacob
[3318.90 --> 3325.54]  Who was one of our engineers at creator warehouse and who did a lot of the ground work on the magnetic cable arches?
[3326.10 --> 3327.30]  um
[3327.38 --> 3329.38]  did a freaking like
[3330.26 --> 3333.38]  Entire course load worth of work on
[3334.10 --> 3341.78]  Magnetism and how to optimize not just the strength of the magnets, but also the properties of their magnetic field
[3342.26 --> 3344.26]  So they're especially strong
[3344.34 --> 3346.74]  Especially close and they're amplified in that way
[3347.22 --> 3352.58]  But as they come off that was less of a concern for him, etc, etc. So the uh, the slug
[3354.02 --> 3359.54]  That whole the slug that holds the magnet in place is actually um
[3360.34 --> 3362.34]  Hold on a second. Let me check for a real one real quick
[3364.18 --> 3368.42]  Yeah, because these are these are like 3d printed actually quite early at this point
[3368.98 --> 3373.06]  Samples as far as my understanding goes, but we have a bin of real ones here good good good
[3373.06 --> 3377.14]  Yes, so the slug sharp the slug is made of a material that actually
[3377.78 --> 3382.66]  Enhances the magnetism of the magnet and heads exactly the way that we want them to hogs
[3383.30 --> 3386.02]  Okay, so not a write-off this right here
[3386.02 --> 3388.74]  I'm just going to zoom in on linus real quick here
[3388.74 --> 3393.70]  This right here is the magnet from the extra large cable management arch
[3394.10 --> 3400.34]  Um, I had some people talking about how serious business magnet how these are these are these are crappy and
[3400.82 --> 3403.38]  They're not even gonna last because magnets don't even last forever
[3403.54 --> 3407.54]  It's like these are neodymium magnets by the way they will last for as long as you will
[3408.10 --> 3411.86]  Um, we've got in each of our cable management arches
[3412.58 --> 3417.06]  Life is fleeting. Yeah, the heat death of the universe is coming. I have to get this out one sec. Ah
[3417.70 --> 3419.70]  Entropy is inevitable
[3420.02 --> 3423.70]  Okay, you gotta absolutely mangle these things. Okay, so we've got two of those
[3424.18 --> 3429.46]  I'm, just gonna zero this scale real. Oh, hold on. I'm just gonna zero this scale real quick here. You must be squishy
[3429.46 --> 3434.74]  I like that one too. Sounds good. Okay, there we go. So i've zeroed my scale. I'm putting my magnets on it
[3434.74 --> 3443.30]  Um, so for the folks who think that you're just going to find this this bar. Yeah, it's expensive. I've never denied that our products are
[3444.02 --> 3446.02]  costly
[3446.02 --> 3452.26]  But they're costly to us, which is why they're costly to other people not because we're just you know gougers and evil people
[3452.26 --> 3455.06]  There's profit margins. We're a company. We have to pay people
[3455.06 --> 3459.62]  But we'll get to that in a second first. Uh, can you tell me? Um, what that reads? 28
[3459.62 --> 3464.98]  28 grams. So if you look up the cost of neodymium, it's about
[3465.70 --> 3469.38]  Uh, here hold on neodymium price here. We can we can do this together
[3470.90 --> 3476.42]  Let's not like that price per kilogram. Here we go. Like doing it's about $95 per kilogram
[3476.66 --> 3481.70]  Which means it's about nine dollars and fifty cents per hundred grams, which means you are looking at
[3482.34 --> 3488.34]  About three dollars worth of magnet just raw just raw neodymium material
[3488.34 --> 3493.54]  That would that so how in what way do you buy like bulk neodymium?
[3494.26 --> 3495.30]  so
[3495.30 --> 3500.02]  Not only is that about three dollars of raw actual material
[3500.02 --> 3507.86]  Yeah, but we customized the exact shape of our magnets in order to optimize them for our cable management arches
[3507.86 --> 3512.10]  So that's the diameter that's the size of the donut hole and that's the thickness
[3512.10 --> 3516.90]  So would you buy would you buy that shaped from a company or did we have to okay?
[3516.90 --> 3521.46]  So from from a magnet so there's probably a premium on top of the bulk price
[3521.46 --> 3526.98]  There would be a premium on top of the raw materials price for anything that involves any kind of processing
[3526.98 --> 3529.06]  Yeah, okay, so then there's logistics
[3529.70 --> 3533.62]  Something people may not realize about magnets is that they're heavy
[3534.26 --> 3539.30]  Yeah, you have to ship them so you have to ship them once to where they get to be integrated with your uh
[3539.30 --> 3545.70]  With your plastic arches then they get to be shipped again to our warehouse where they need to be handled and they need to be stored
[3545.70 --> 3547.70]  Um
[3548.82 --> 3555.14]  There's also the engineering time there's the re there's all the work that went into making sure that our cable management holders
[3555.70 --> 3562.82]  Are going to freaking hold things that's it that has to be paid for someone told me at some point that that's important
[3563.14 --> 3563.94]  Yeah, yeah
[3563.94 --> 3566.26]  Yeah, that that that that that that matters that makes sense
[3566.26 --> 3571.78]  Um, and yeah, the company has to make money we have to account for breakage we have to account for
[3572.42 --> 3578.18]  Um, you know the potential for people to want us to process returns, you know, we have to pay customer service people
[3578.66 --> 3578.98]  um
[3580.82 --> 3581.38]  Basically
[3581.38 --> 3587.22]  In a nutshell if you find something that claims to be our magnetic cable management arches
[3587.78 --> 3590.34]  But at a small fraction of the price
[3590.82 --> 3595.46]  Then what you know because you are the kind of person who is not a write-off and who can
[3596.18 --> 3597.94]  Observe things right off
[3597.94 --> 3600.26]  Yeah, and and is and is open to new ideas
[3601.06 --> 3604.42]  Uh, you will know that it is not in fact the same thing is actually a different thing
[3604.42 --> 3607.54]  And you know what that different thing might be fine for you
[3608.26 --> 3613.38]  We knew that we were making an extremely premium product that was not going to make sense for everybody
[3614.02 --> 3614.82]  We knew that
[3615.62 --> 3621.54]  But we also knew that what we wanted was the cable management solution that I wanted to use
[3622.18 --> 3625.86]  And unfortunately it involves a crap ton
[3626.90 --> 3627.94]  Of magnetic material
[3630.02 --> 3634.02]  So yeah, i'm sorry they're expensive also fortunately because it's really cool to use
[3634.42 --> 3635.70]  It's a sweet system. Yeah
[3636.50 --> 3640.58]  I'm happy they did the gift thing. The big one is freaking ridiculous. Yeah. Hey, look, do you wanna?
[3640.98 --> 3644.10]  I mean, it really actually would be helpful because there is margin in them
[3644.10 --> 3650.90]  We do make money on them. Oh, yeah, there we go, but it would be really helpful. Oh, it's a mess. Oh, it's so clean. Oh my goodness. Oh, it's a mess
[3651.30 --> 3652.58]  Oh, no
[3652.58 --> 3657.06]  Oh, it's so clean. I guess now's a good time to kind of run through the whole product line. So
[3657.54 --> 3662.50]  Uh, the the big one the one that came to me in a dream in the middle of the night was the power bar one
[3662.50 --> 3670.50]  And man the amount of work that went into getting the geometry and the manufacturing just right for the little like keyhole one
[3670.74 --> 3673.30]  We had to buy dozens of power bars
[3673.86 --> 3679.78]  Power bars routers network switches anything with that keyhole shaped mounting thing
[3679.78 --> 3685.06]  Uh, here i'm just going to hop over to the store on my computer for a second here
[3686.74 --> 3690.02]  Home magnetic cable management. Here we go linus laptop
[3690.58 --> 3691.70]  Uh anchor
[3692.58 --> 3699.70]  Power bar keys. Yeah, basically anything with that little um with that little uh key shaped uh hole on the back of it
[3700.18 --> 3702.26]  I like the gifts. The gifts are good. Yeah
[3702.26 --> 3704.26]  I'm happy we did the gifts
[3704.66 --> 3706.90]  If I had done this one, I might have done it vertically
[3707.70 --> 3714.02]  Um, and it would involve plugging in and unplugging something into the outlet. Take it off plug it in and put it back
[3714.26 --> 3720.50]  Because this was a major. Oh, that's pretty sweet. This was a major product design consideration for me. Oh, dude
[3720.50 --> 3724.82]  If it's blindly under your desk and I could just reach and grab it and
[3725.46 --> 3731.62]  Plug something in and just put it back. Not only that, but the magnet is so strong that you don't have to pull it off
[3733.14 --> 3735.14]  You can unplug something from it
[3736.42 --> 3744.74]  Unless you have the world's tightest outlet holes, which you probably don't you can unplug something from it without pulling the whole thing off the wall
[3745.06 --> 3750.50]  So that that was a major major design consideration for me and is one of the reasons that this one has so much
[3750.90 --> 3756.26]  Bloody metal in it. Oh my was because we wanted the hold strength to be great enough. That makes sense
[3756.58 --> 3760.74]  My use case was like I could pull it off and then look at it and like decide where I want to plug it in
[3760.74 --> 3764.42]  But I see what you're talking about this one is my personal favorite one
[3764.42 --> 3769.62]  And it's selling really well because it solves a problem that unlike some of the other ones
[3770.18 --> 3772.74]  There is not a current solution for
[3773.38 --> 3774.34]  Um
[3774.34 --> 3780.66]  No, i'm not talking like there isn't a better solution there just isn't a current solution for it. It's really elegant the way that it installs
[3782.34 --> 3788.02]  Stays on there it stays on really good and then just sticks on to stuff. I absolutely love this product
[3788.42 --> 3794.50]  Um, but then you know the the dream didn't end there. The next big one was this one the power brick holders. Yeah
[3794.50 --> 3804.74]  Same thing we wanted to be able to accommodate even gigantic chonky like laptop or dock power bricks that can do 250 watts or whatever else
[3805.22 --> 3809.30]  And then we didn't want to make it huge because we wanted to be able to accommodate much smaller ones
[3809.62 --> 3814.82]  But this one is designed to be finally a way to keep your stupid power bricks
[3815.38 --> 3818.34]  organized in a way that is not horrible
[3819.14 --> 3820.42]  um
[3820.42 --> 3823.86]  I don't want to see another power brick on the floor in our office basically anymore
[3824.18 --> 3828.42]  So we show you show us how this works because someone was in one of the product photos
[3828.66 --> 3831.70]  Yeah, it shows that uh where the strap goes
[3832.42 --> 3834.42]  looks like it's a very small
[3835.46 --> 3837.46]  A very small little hole
[3838.10 --> 3841.70]  Oh, yeah, sure i'd be happy to show how okay do i have any uh uh
[3841.94 --> 3843.38]  uh cable ties
[3844.10 --> 3844.82]  i don't know
[3844.82 --> 3848.10]  i have i have i have i have i have okay yeah okay so i can show you guys how this works
[3848.66 --> 3848.90]  um
[3850.42 --> 3856.50]  So are these cable ties specific to this thing nope yeah they're longer oh these go with a different thing don't worry about it got it
[3856.58 --> 3859.30]  Okay, so basically we've got the but uh
[3860.18 --> 3864.34]  Do that me oh yeah there you go you can kind of see it so there's kind of like a keyhole shape thing so
[3865.14 --> 3873.30]  It has it has overhangs yeah, you know, I see how it works in mold design are a little tricky, but hey, we got good engineers
[3873.78 --> 3876.34]  um, so what you do is you take the cable tie hole
[3876.34 --> 3881.86]  And yeah, that's pretty cool. It's a little bit of a pain the first time yeah, but what in particular
[3882.42 --> 3886.50]  But you make sure it gets under that spot there and kind of want it to be because then it's going to be you know
[3886.50 --> 3889.54]  It's gonna be snug and then it's on there. Yeah, right?
[3889.54 --> 3894.66]  Yeah, so then you put your thing you know, whatever it is no nine you wrap it around nice
[3898.74 --> 3904.50]  And you get it on there then you do the other one and it's ready to go sweet okay that makes sense yeah
[3905.38 --> 3910.18]  Because some people were looking at the the little hole and thinking like is this for zap straps not cable ties
[3910.18 --> 3912.66]  But no, it's just it's on the other side. No, it makes sense. Yeah
[3912.66 --> 3914.66]  I promise you
[3916.02 --> 3918.02]  Whatever you see about them
[3918.26 --> 3920.50]  Way more thought was put into it then should
[3920.98 --> 3925.94]  Well, that's why I wanted you to yeah to show me so it's like i'm sure there's there's something going on. I just I didn't know
[3926.42 --> 3932.42]  Um, so yeah line of slap up so this one I absolutely love and then the cable tie holders
[3932.66 --> 3936.90]  Actually, I think these are the top seller so far. No, no, they're not. No, they're not
[3936.90 --> 3938.90]  These are moving really well as well though
[3939.46 --> 3943.38]  But what's cool about these ones is we realized okay? Yeah arches are cool
[3944.10 --> 3946.26]  But you don't always have a ton of room
[3946.98 --> 3951.86]  So these run parallel to the cables so they hide really nice
[3952.42 --> 3957.46]  Um, they're I didn't think about that. They're less convenient. No, right because you're still essentially
[3958.18 --> 3960.18]  Using cable ties, right?
[3960.18 --> 3964.74]  But you're using cable ties that can be anchored and can be really really
[3964.74 --> 3969.30]  Um stealthily run and you can kind of put a cable tie anywhere now
[3969.30 --> 3974.50]  Well, yeah, and like one of the issues with cable ties is you'll have like sag in the route
[3974.50 --> 3979.70]  Yes, or whatever or it has to go around something that often can't happen. Yada yada. So you can keep it nice and
[3980.26 --> 3985.78]  So the geometry here is cool because we've got a really nice high profile run under here
[3985.78 --> 3987.06]  It looks like a sci-fi bridge
[3987.06 --> 3992.98]  So if you have a very small cable bundle or a longer cable tie you just wrap more times and there will still be enough
[3992.98 --> 3997.78]  Clearance for the uh for the magnets to grab. Yeah, so this one's great
[3997.78 --> 4004.42]  And then of course the I think the arches are the are the top seller the bread and butter the bread and butter the meat and potatoes
[4004.74 --> 4006.74]  And then the big one is
[4006.74 --> 4009.38]  Cray cray if you want to see these things in action
[4010.34 --> 4015.78]  Really well, um, the there's a there's a clip from the building the
[4016.66 --> 4018.02]  the
[4018.02 --> 4025.22]  The land gaming machines at my house where I cable manage the back of my server rack my whole setup at home has been waiting for this
[4025.54 --> 4027.54]  and i've got freaking like
[4027.78 --> 4029.86]  bundles of wires that like
[4031.46 --> 4035.62]  Like taking the big one and like getting it down on the one side and like stuffing them in there like
[4036.82 --> 4038.34]  and then it's just
[4038.34 --> 4042.02]  There's some it grabs dude. I'm not gonna call out the brand too much
[4042.02 --> 4046.42]  But there's some funky cables in the server room over at the lab and these
[4047.14 --> 4053.06]  Mondo arches kind of saved the cable management of those cables because they were they're very big and
[4053.78 --> 4057.86]  Kind of unwieldy and there's nothing we could really do with them and then we were just like
[4057.86 --> 4062.02]  What if we just magnum all to the wall and it was like yeah, okay that works
[4062.26 --> 4066.82]  You can't like we couldn't really tie them down very well like there was a lot of issues and then we're just like yep
[4066.82 --> 4071.70]  We can force it that'll be fine so basically
[4073.06 --> 4074.42]  Yeah
[4074.50 --> 4078.18]  Really exciting launch it's going really well the power bar is key
[4080.02 --> 4086.82]  Quarter 20th thread for hackability what oh yeah, that's right so okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. How
[4086.82 --> 4088.82]  Hold on hold on hold on
[4090.42 --> 4095.78]  You madman what are you talking about I can't believe you did that that's sick do I have one of these?
[4096.74 --> 4102.34]  Do you understand? Yeah? Yeah, like 10 out of 10 good choice. I love you. Uh here it is oh here it is
[4103.30 --> 4108.66]  Okay, so I gotta see it. Oh what okay, so these are the power bar keys
[4109.70 --> 4110.50]  Oh
[4110.50 --> 4114.66]  Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot more sense not only is
[4114.66 --> 4118.10]  Is the power brick not power bar? I was very sorry hold on hold on
[4121.06 --> 4123.62]  Not only is the geometry
[4124.50 --> 4126.50]  uh perfect
[4126.58 --> 4127.86]  for
[4127.86 --> 4129.86]  running your um
[4130.34 --> 4134.74]  Sorry for going into one of your you know power bars or network switches or whatever else
[4135.14 --> 4140.02]  And it really was a very very significant engineering challenge to get that perfect. I'm sorry
[4140.02 --> 4142.10]  I don't have enough zoom guys one of these days
[4142.10 --> 4147.22]  We're just gonna go full qvc and we're gonna have like you know hand hand cam. Don't worry, dan. No, no, dan dan
[4147.38 --> 4149.38]  Don't don't worry. Don't for real
[4149.46 --> 4154.82]  But as a meme one day you should hire like a hand model for when show but what's cool
[4155.70 --> 4157.70]  I'm sitting right here
[4158.42 --> 4164.66]  Is that it's quarter 20 threaded down the middle of the of the magnetic strength enhancing insert?
[4164.66 --> 4167.62]  So if you wanted to hacks or
[4168.66 --> 4170.10]  Something else
[4170.10 --> 4175.54]  Some other shaft into this thing and mount flipping anything you wanted with a magnet
[4176.42 --> 4180.02]  Then you could like camera gear well, especially camera gear
[4180.02 --> 4183.70]  So it was the camera crew that was like hey, yeah, uh, could you guys make this?
[4184.34 --> 4186.02]  Yeah, because they use it for everything. Yeah
[4187.14 --> 4188.34]  That's wild
[4188.34 --> 4193.14]  Oh, man, it's gonna be uh interesting would a hand model for the wanshow be a tax rate off?
[4193.14 --> 4198.10]  That's a good question. Yes, if we paid them which we would have to because they'd be a person who needs to be paid
[4198.26 --> 4202.02]  Yeah, so yes, they'd be a right that'd be a tax rate. That's good to know
[4203.06 --> 4206.58]  So yeah, it's it was man. This has been such a long time coming
[4206.98 --> 4209.94]  Um, there's a couple of notes here that i'm supposed to read from the team
[4210.50 --> 4214.26]  Uh available in four arch sizes. Yeah, we talked through all the different solutions
[4214.58 --> 4219.38]  Each pack of arches or accessories comes with matching standard steel plates and screws. Okay
[4219.38 --> 4225.54]  Had a lot of people questioning why it costs so much to upgrade to vhb when vhb is cheap
[4226.58 --> 4230.18]  That's so great that vhb is cheap go buy some
[4231.70 --> 4234.34]  And put it on the standard steel plates. It'll work great
[4235.78 --> 4239.62]  So that's why because we didn't want to charge everyone for vhb
[4239.62 --> 4246.42]  Which was a significant adder compared to using the more temporary adhesive and
[4246.66 --> 4254.18]  Wasn't necessarily useful for everybody not everyone wants to put something onto their onto their wall or onto their desk with what is
[4255.14 --> 4259.54]  Essentially a permanent adhesive about as permanent as a double-sided tape gets
[4259.54 --> 4262.18]  It's either permanent or it's very likely to cause damage
[4262.18 --> 4266.66]  So we wanted the standard loadout to have a much lighter adhesive
[4267.30 --> 4274.26]  Nothing prevents you from putting your own adhesive on those standard plates and sticking them with whatever you want to whatever you want
[4274.58 --> 4277.46]  And the only cost to you is a roll of vhb
[4278.26 --> 4280.90]  Now what we also knew is not everybody's going to want to do that
[4281.38 --> 4286.98]  Some people are just going to be like eh can't be arsed and they would rather buy vhb plates from us
[4287.70 --> 4292.02]  That's where the vhb plates came from and you know what the handling costs
[4292.42 --> 4293.70]  of like
[4293.70 --> 4295.86]  sleeves of of of taped things
[4297.14 --> 4299.54]  Yeah, it adds to it adds to the price of it
[4299.54 --> 4306.10]  There's a lot of overhead in uh in the actual production of the stupid things and the packaging and the shipping and the handling
[4306.10 --> 4308.50]  So yeah, it's not as cheap, but hey
[4309.14 --> 4314.10]  You can buy a roll of vhb tape and it comes with the steel plates that you need so you're good to go
[4314.82 --> 4319.06]  As for the silicone grips, um people were questioning what they're for
[4320.02 --> 4322.02]  Yeah, this is cool though
[4323.14 --> 4326.66]  So for maximum magnetic holding strength
[4327.22 --> 4328.66]  along this axis
[4329.46 --> 4332.58]  Okay, you want the magnet directly on the metal surface
[4334.02 --> 4338.10]  Anything in between you're going to compromise some of that holding strength
[4338.10 --> 4345.46]  Remember I did say that the magnetic fields are optimized right right right next to the magnets and that's true of pretty much any magnet because it's like
[4345.46 --> 4346.42]  uh
[4346.42 --> 4352.50]  Whatever inverse square or whatever, but the point is that magnetic field strength falls away like exponentially essentially
[4352.82 --> 4355.14]  So any magnet the closer you are the better
[4355.38 --> 4357.78]  So we made the design decision very early on
[4357.78 --> 4363.14]  So you want to not recess the magnets into the plastic whoops
[4364.34 --> 4364.42]  There
[4364.42 --> 4370.58]  There uh not recess the magnets under the plastic because that would have reduced the risk of scratching
[4370.58 --> 4373.78]  But it would have hurt the hold strength which for me was the top priority
[4374.26 --> 4378.42]  So if you're concerned about the metal thing that you're sticking these arches onto
[4378.42 --> 4383.54]  Um getting scratched by you know potentially having it shift slightly
[4384.10 --> 4391.38]  Then what you want is the silicone stickers which you can put onto your server rack or put onto your desk
[4391.38 --> 4395.94]  That will sit in between the magnet and your and your nice you know
[4395.94 --> 4400.18]  Not wanting to be scratched surface and yeah, you lose a little bit of hold strength
[4400.18 --> 4404.34]  However, what you gain and this is not the right one for this. Don't worry
[4404.34 --> 4410.50]  We have them in all the right sizes. Uh, what you will gain is much better strength on the y-axis
[4411.38 --> 4414.74]  That makes sense. Yeah, so it won't shift around as much and it won't
[4415.30 --> 4417.22]  Slide yeah, yeah, yeah, um
[4417.86 --> 4424.18]  But you lose a little bit of strength and they're very strong. So that's probably okay. Yeah, it's totally fine. Yeah, um
[4424.18 --> 4428.74]  So we have we have some bundles if you're not sure where to start the essential the home and server bundles
[4428.74 --> 4431.78]  And you can get them all at ltdstore.com slash mcm
[4432.42 --> 4434.42]  I want to eventually have
[4435.78 --> 4440.58]  Conrad and potentially others involved make a cable management configurator
[4441.06 --> 4447.06]  You know how we have the desk pad configurator. There are a lot of pitfalls. I know there's a lot of variations
[4448.18 --> 4453.78]  Also, we're now working in 3d space and you have to deal with different cables and different sizes. Oh my god
[4453.78 --> 4459.86]  Do you want people to be able to put them on their desk? Yeah, I thought you just meant like a configurator so you can like order all the things
[4459.86 --> 4463.86]  No, I want people to be able to design their desk. I think yeah
[4464.58 --> 4469.46]  Let's not put r&d into that. We haven't because of exactly the reasons that you're thinking
[4470.18 --> 4471.94]  But it would be cool
[4471.94 --> 4476.90]  If you're curious about if you want to learn a little bit more about some of the work that went into making these a reality
[4476.90 --> 4480.82]  We're gonna have a newsletter out so sign up for the newsletter on ltdstore.com
[4480.82 --> 4482.26]  That would be a good one
[4482.26 --> 4486.34]  And we'll have that out to you guys hopefully in the next you know week or two, but
[4486.90 --> 4489.54]  Hey, you know things take as long as they take until they're good
[4489.94 --> 4495.70]  So here's where to sign up for the newsletter. You can also see an archive of past newsletters here
[4496.02 --> 4500.10]  If you want to learn a little bit more about the precision screwdriver that backpack that was
[4500.10 --> 4504.66]  uh that survived a mine, um lasers, etc
[4506.18 --> 4506.66]  All right
[4507.70 --> 4511.62]  People are saying that the configurator could be a tax write-off. Oh my god, which is interesting
[4512.58 --> 4516.50]  Maybe a path to consider luke. I think i've got enough tax write-off for today
[4517.14 --> 4522.34]  Um, let's see. Let's see how much you've got more than enough sir. I think you have significantly more than enough
[4524.18 --> 4525.14]  Ridiculous
[4525.14 --> 4529.30]  Let's see how our tax write-off shirt is doing. I knew you guys would love this tax write-off shirt. Good lord
[4529.30 --> 4532.34]  Almost a thousand. Yeah, I mean it's a ten dollar t-shirt
[4533.06 --> 4534.58]  It's a really nice t-shirt. Yeah
[4535.22 --> 4537.22]  It's the same quality as all the other t-shirts. Yep
[4537.94 --> 4539.06]  And in a great color
[4539.86 --> 4542.50]  Tax write-off periwinkle and tax write-off pink
[4544.34 --> 4550.18]  Oh, man. All right, uh, what are we supposed to do? Oh, we're supposed to explain. Oh, what?
[4551.22 --> 4554.66]  Periwinkle is sold out. Already? Yeah, every size
[4556.02 --> 4558.02]  Holy crap
[4558.02 --> 4559.22]  Um
[4559.22 --> 4560.02]  Huh
[4560.02 --> 4566.90]  Well, this is maybe oh is pink sold out as well? No pink is sold out in most sizes. This is really gonna hurt our ability to write-off
[4568.02 --> 4572.98]  Um extra extra large enough money triple extra large hold on a second wait
[4574.58 --> 4577.14]  Yeah, there's only large and extra large left in pink
[4577.78 --> 4581.86]  That's it. Okay. This might be a problem. Yeah, maybe it was priced too low
[4583.54 --> 4585.54]  Just a thought
[4585.54 --> 4595.46]  Uh, uh, mr. Nick light you're on the show. You're live on the wan show
[4595.46 --> 4600.10]  Hi, um, we have a significant problem with the tax write-off shirt
[4600.74 --> 4605.70]  Yeah, we're not able to write off any more taxes because we've run out of stock. What can we do?
[4605.70 --> 4611.46]  Uh, that seems like a
[4611.46 --> 4616.26]  A question that answers itself. Your write-off budget is full
[4616.90 --> 4620.50]  Okay, you should pull a ninja move and change it to 99 dollars
[4620.50 --> 4622.02]  Um, i'm just
[4622.02 --> 4628.26]  Um, i'm i'm worried nick. I'm worried nick that we won't be able to write off enough for our taxes this year
[4628.26 --> 4632.82]  Okay, well, let me uh, I guess let me look into that
[4632.82 --> 4633.46]  Okay
[4633.46 --> 4635.30]  Okay
[4635.30 --> 4636.90]  See if anything can be done
[4636.90 --> 4637.46]  Okay
[4637.46 --> 4642.42]  All right. Can you can you let me know in the next little bit here if there's anything else we can write off?
[4643.30 --> 4647.62]  Oh, i'll do my best. Okay. Don't worry. They're buying lots of cable management
[4648.58 --> 4652.02]  I sure hope they are. Okay. All right. Okay. We're gonna work on it
[4653.22 --> 4655.30]  Goodbye. Okay. All right. Thanks, nick
[4655.30 --> 4659.70]  Bye. Okay. All right. He's working on it. We gotta optimize our write-offs here
[4660.10 --> 4662.74]  In the meantime, do you want to explain to the people how merch messages work?
[4662.74 --> 4665.22]  I'm dying. That's that's a you thing. You do that. All right
[4665.22 --> 4669.30]  I'll explain how much messages work. The way to interact with the show is not with twitch bits
[4669.30 --> 4674.98]  Not with super chats. It's with merch messages a tool that was built by our very own float plane team
[4675.38 --> 4678.58]  And is freaking awesome. Sorry. Let's go. Let's go
[4679.62 --> 4682.58]  Basically, all you got to do is head to lttstore.com
[4682.58 --> 4687.86]  Pick up something put it in your cart and in your cart. You will see a box for merch messages
[4688.66 --> 4690.90]  That message will go to producer Dan
[4691.78 --> 4692.98]  How are you doing by the way?
[4695.78 --> 4697.86]  Who will do his best
[4700.02 --> 4703.54]  To forward your message to the appropriate department reply to you
[4704.42 --> 4710.74]  Throw your message up onto the screen for everybody to see you know if you have a shout out to your mom or to your
[4710.74 --> 4713.62]  Friends mom if you know what i'm saying it'll it'll go up there
[4714.74 --> 4718.74]  You're not even paying attention. Are you i'm actually trying to help Dan. That's that's cool
[4718.98 --> 4719.94]  That's fine. It's fine
[4719.94 --> 4728.42]  Or it will get curated for me and luke, uh, and we will uh, we will address your question here on the show sometimes for like
[4729.46 --> 4731.30]  Ever yeah for a very long time today
[4731.30 --> 4732.74]  It's not going to go forever. Probably not
[4732.74 --> 4738.18]  We got to play super checks for the after party many of these yeah, there's got to be a super super checks after party
[4738.18 --> 4740.42]  So it's going to be it's going to be great if you're on float plane
[4740.50 --> 4742.42]  Yeah, we've got the archive from it last
[4742.42 --> 4746.18]  Last one was fun people seem to like it. No people seem to be super yeah into it
[4746.50 --> 4749.94]  Um, yeah, I think people were surprised at how fun it was actually
[4750.18 --> 4754.26]  Yeah, super checks a lot of the comments were like wow. This is actually pretty fun to watch. It's like yeah
[4754.58 --> 4758.98]  Yeah, we we uploaded that as an extra exclusive last week. Yeah. Oh
[4758.98 --> 4765.22]  Oh, speaking of flow plane exclusives. Yeah, okay, so hold on here's the here's the live stream vod from super checks
[4765.62 --> 4767.54]  Yeah, the uh the reviews are in
[4769.22 --> 4773.14]  Yeah, zero dislikes super checks after party very popular
[4773.86 --> 4775.94]  Um anyway, here's that here's some gameplay
[4777.14 --> 4779.14]  Look at that save dude
[4779.54 --> 4786.58]  Oh look at that less of a save. Well rip. That's a goal for linus. Yeah, anyway, the point is I've always read color balance is wrong
[4786.58 --> 4790.10]  I need to fix that super checks lots of fun. Uh, this is great
[4790.34 --> 4794.18]  Uh, the float plane team asked me to do a little sneak peek of this
[4794.18 --> 4797.14]  So this is from this is from the upcoming team liked it
[4797.62 --> 4803.94]  This is from the oh, that's hilarious the upcoming collab with the one the only ludwig
[4805.06 --> 4808.34]  So we built the pc that punishes the user
[4809.06 --> 4814.50]  um, it's got a variety of uh of servos and relays on it
[4814.50 --> 4819.46]  Uh, it's got an integration with minecraft courtesy of signal rgb
[4819.94 --> 4825.46]  And basically every time he goes in the water and we put him on this wipeout course
[4825.46 --> 4829.38]  Every time he goes in the water his bidets go off and spray him
[4829.94 --> 4835.06]  If he dies, there's a variety of effects that will hit him with everything including these little uh
[4835.06 --> 4838.98]  Gel ball blast this little gel ball blaster here to a fart cannon like
[4838.98 --> 4842.66]  Left welts. Oh, yeah, it really hurt um
[4843.78 --> 4850.02]  The point is it's gonna be an absolutely awesome movie movie. It's gonna be an absolutely awesome video
[4850.82 --> 4852.98]  Yeah, thanks. It's gonna be an awesome video
[4852.98 --> 4858.58]  And we're gonna have some exclusives on float plane including the sneak peek and maybe we'll maybe we'll do an uncut this time
[4859.06 --> 4861.06]  Uh, and this is why we need to fight
[4861.06 --> 4866.74]  Yeah, I warned him in the in the uh, in the what do you call it pre-show?
[4867.06 --> 4868.74]  I warned him in the pre-stream pre-show
[4869.38 --> 4874.58]  That we have on float plane and also technically twitch, uh, that we were gonna fight this stream. I prepped it
[4874.58 --> 4876.58]  But I didn't tell him why this is the topic
[4877.78 --> 4881.78]  Are you salty that I didn't tell you ludwig was coming and you didn't get to hang out?
[4882.02 --> 4883.14]  So
[4883.14 --> 4888.50]  Yes, but also i'm very sorry. It actually did not occur to me. I was very flustered that day
[4888.50 --> 4893.38]  There's multiple other things. Oh, okay. Apparently we're fighting about a lot of things. So that's what that's one of them
[4893.38 --> 4895.62]  Okay, hang out with Ludwig would be cool, but
[4896.90 --> 4902.26]  You even mentioned with the the the like the entire badminton center to screen thing. You're like, oh, I should have brought you or
[4903.30 --> 4908.82]  What do you think would have been the most entertaining thing for me to be engaged with probably in the last multiple years that we've done?
[4909.62 --> 4911.62]  Probably the punishment pc
[4912.98 --> 4914.98]  Yeah, okay, okay
[4914.98 --> 4920.34]  Um that looked insanely fun. It's still like works, right? I don't know. Oh, man
[4920.42 --> 4923.54]  We should do like an extras thing of just like random people in the company trying to do it
[4924.42 --> 4927.46]  I would love to do that. You want to try the punishment pc? It looks so much fun
[4928.74 --> 4928.98]  I
[4928.98 --> 4934.90]  I like had work to do, but I like just sitting there watching it happen was like fantastic. Okay, I'll tell you what
[4935.38 --> 4938.10]  I'll tell you what it looked so good. I promise you
[4938.10 --> 4941.06]  Hold on hold on
[4941.78 --> 4944.74]  I promise you tiny nets down. I promise you
[4945.86 --> 4949.54]  If and this is actually some very bad news. Oh boy
[4949.70 --> 4954.42]  We got some news from the city of surrey that we may not be allowed to do LAN events at the badminton center
[4955.54 --> 4961.54]  We're gonna work with them. I'm I I am confident my team is sad because that was this was a lot of I know
[4961.54 --> 4965.94]  I understand other people also put a lot of work in I hold on I am confident
[4966.58 --> 4967.86]  That we can
[4968.66 --> 4974.74]  We can find a solution together at this time. I'm still confident. Okay, um
[4975.62 --> 4984.66]  They they have expressed a variety of concerns that I think we can address if as long as everyone is is moving forward together in good faith
[4985.22 --> 4987.30]  Yeah, that I think we can address cool. Okay
[4987.30 --> 4991.54]  As long as it goes forward as long as it goes forward
[4991.78 --> 4995.78]  I promise you at one of those whale and events at least
[4996.58 --> 5002.26]  We will resurrect the punishment pc. That's amazing. Okay, because the code is done and that was the hard part. Yeah
[5002.50 --> 5007.54]  Was the esp32 based web server and the integration with signal rgb and you want to be involved
[5007.54 --> 5014.42]  You need to bring a change of clothes and a towel. You should bring two changes the clothes and two towels. Yeah, uh, we we had to redress him
[5015.06 --> 5017.06]  multiple times
[5017.54 --> 5022.10]  That's amazing the last the last the last part. This is a the triple part thing
[5022.66 --> 5024.66]  um, I
[5024.66 --> 5026.66]  Think you cheated on me. I
[5027.30 --> 5032.66]  Cheated on you. Yeah, sorry. What yeah. Yeah, I would never play super checks with anyone else
[5034.66 --> 5037.30]  No, the shock collars the shock collars
[5037.54 --> 5038.74]  It didn't technically happen
[5038.74 --> 5043.06]  But you had intention and I don't think electro boom counts because my reasoning for that
[5043.06 --> 5048.58]  That's his whole jam if you are in a european country that does cheat kisses you do cheat kisses that is not cheating even though
[5048.58 --> 5052.82]  I see and so if you're hanging out with electro boom you're gonna get shocked. This is fine
[5053.22 --> 5059.86]  Okay, okay. This is fine. Mm-hmm, but there was a plan for shock collars. I was not involved. I see okay, so
[5059.86 --> 5061.86]  So our
[5064.82 --> 5067.94]  Our exclusive thing is bdsm
[5067.94 --> 5071.62]  Is that what you're saying?
[5071.62 --> 5073.62]  That was really close
[5074.18 --> 5076.18]  I think it went back into the bottle
[5077.14 --> 5078.98]  Uh, yes, I guess
[5079.22 --> 5079.86]  I guess so
[5079.86 --> 5081.86]  I
[5082.10 --> 5087.22]  I see okay, i'll keep it in mind really fully put that together until now, but yeah, yeah
[5087.46 --> 5093.14]  Anyways, i'll keep it in mind. I'm just messing around but that I watched I didn't watch the whole thing. Linus. Do you say to luke upbees?
[5097.22 --> 5099.06]  I'm sorry i'm not
[5100.42 --> 5102.42]  I'm not but i'm sorry
[5102.98 --> 5106.10]  Oh my goodness. Alrighty then
[5106.10 --> 5111.94]  Usually the show doesn't get this unhinged until much later
[5112.98 --> 5115.38]  I watched part of the exclusive footage. It's
[5116.18 --> 5123.46]  Awesome, that's gonna be a fantastic. Well ludwig's an a plus talent s tier world-class talent
[5124.42 --> 5126.42]  He is
[5127.14 --> 5131.46]  He has the same level of get it done at any cost
[5131.70 --> 5135.22]  I could I was only there for like a couple minutes. I could tell he has just
[5135.86 --> 5142.74]  That's cool. The guy's next level respect to say that he was a good sport about everything that happened to him while he was here
[5143.22 --> 5145.30]  Would be a gross understatement
[5145.94 --> 5151.54]  Um, let me put it this way at one point he had to sit on a toilet that had a gopro in the bowl
[5155.62 --> 5156.98]  Barely even phased him
[5158.82 --> 5160.82]  That sounds about right yeah my um
[5160.82 --> 5164.98]  Yeah, I don't even know if I want to mention it or not
[5168.26 --> 5175.06]  My favorite youtube video of potentially all time is i've sent it to you even i don't even send lines that many videos
[5175.78 --> 5177.78]  You know what i'm talking about?
[5177.78 --> 5179.22]  Yes, I know which one you're talking about
[5179.22 --> 5185.78]  It's one of ludwig's. Nope, technically not. Okay slimes. Yes slimes top 10 salty ice climber
[5185.78 --> 5188.34]  Ludwig's in it a lot. Yeah, yeah
[5190.74 --> 5191.22]  It's good
[5191.94 --> 5194.58]  It's it's like actual top to your content
[5195.22 --> 5200.34]  Yeah, um anyways, all right cool. So anyway, that's gonna be a fantastic video
[5200.90 --> 5202.10]  um, yeah
[5202.10 --> 5204.50]  Absolute check it out absolute mad lad
[5204.50 --> 5207.70]  Check out the full point exclusive check out the full video when it releases had a ton of fun with them
[5207.70 --> 5211.70]  Uh, dan do you want to show us how merch messages work or do you want luke to just pick a couple?
[5211.70 --> 5216.10]  Nah, it's fine. It's fine. We can pick a couple the dashboard is broken. Look at this
[5216.10 --> 5220.66]  I can't even scroll in the dashboard. It just stops after a mine is working perfectly
[5221.62 --> 5227.46]  Uh, you're you're limited to 125 merch messages. Uh, no, no, I can see I they'll load in it
[5227.46 --> 5231.94]  Just it just breaks the you can you can limit it more if you want more speed
[5231.94 --> 5234.02]  Oh, yeah, I kind of got a bit more resources
[5234.58 --> 5237.62]  Do you want more load bearing or do you want more speed?
[5237.62 --> 5242.34]  I got this I want nick to call me back and tell me how we're gonna write off more taxes
[5242.34 --> 5245.14]  I think I like luke's idea. He's just start selling over a hundred dollars
[5246.42 --> 5247.46]  Um
[5247.46 --> 5253.46]  So some you know you lose money on almost all of them and then a few random people are gonna buy a pink shirt for a hundred dollars
[5253.46 --> 5256.42]  Probably some more and yeah, you know how marketing works, okay?
[5257.38 --> 5261.38]  Uh, this is a good merch message question thing, uh on this topic
[5261.38 --> 5268.26]  Do you see a future where lmg runs entirely on sales through lttstore.com making external ads a thing of the past?
[5268.26 --> 5270.26]  What could change about the company?
[5272.82 --> 5274.50]  That's a really big brain question
[5276.74 --> 5278.74]  I think that would be oversaturation
[5280.34 --> 5280.66]  Well
[5281.46 --> 5283.46]  It depends what lttstore.com is
[5284.26 --> 5286.26]  true fair
[5286.26 --> 5289.86]  Yeah, what if lttstore.com didn't only sell
[5289.86 --> 5296.18]  Yeah, ltt merch we already don't technically we already don't so we could we already sell jerry-rig everything knives
[5296.42 --> 5299.86]  Yeah, we already sell we already sell swipe swipe bidets
[5299.94 --> 5304.02]  Which might have been the reason that ludwig was up here collabing also just because he's a bro
[5304.02 --> 5308.66]  But like that might make sense why he was sitting on a toilet and why his bidets were spraying him. He was up here
[5308.74 --> 5309.78]  He was up here
[5309.78 --> 5315.54]  Uh talking about his bidets and helping us out helping us promote the product. I don't know the product we might carry
[5315.54 --> 5321.62]  Uh ptm 79 50 i was gonna say i don't know if that 100% counts, but I think it does oh that counts an extra lot
[5321.62 --> 5326.50]  Yeah, it's just it has ltt branding on it. Yeah, but we're very clear. We're very upfront
[5326.74 --> 5330.50]  This is not something we made this is a honeywell product developed by honeywell
[5330.58 --> 5337.86]  It's a it's a very excellent phase change thermal interface material extremely good longevity extremely good
[5337.86 --> 5340.26]  um extremely low thermal resistance
[5340.90 --> 5342.90]  um really great product so like
[5344.58 --> 5348.58]  There's the very beginnings there there's the very beginnings of a trajectory
[5349.14 --> 5352.74]  And I think what our big brained viewer has figured out
[5353.38 --> 5357.14]  And if our big brain viewer was galaxy brain enough
[5357.62 --> 5362.02]  They might also figure out that one of the things that we've done
[5362.02 --> 5371.54]  For example with ptm 79 50 yeah was used our internal testing resources to make sure that that thing that's listed on lttstore.com is really good
[5375.30 --> 5379.22]  If they were quality validated colossal galaxy
[5380.02 --> 5384.74]  Mondo brain they might have identified that there is a serious and
[5385.38 --> 5391.70]  That's going on in online retail right now and not just in your swipe a day equipped toilets
[5392.02 --> 5394.02]  Mm-hmm
[5394.02 --> 5396.02]  Making it really hard to find
[5396.98 --> 5400.02]  Trustworthy sources for just like stuff you want to buy
[5400.82 --> 5402.82]  um, so what if there was a
[5403.46 --> 5405.46]  media organization
[5405.62 --> 5406.58]  that
[5406.58 --> 5407.78]  aspired
[5407.78 --> 5409.78]  to
[5409.86 --> 5411.78]  Having a trusted
[5411.78 --> 5413.78]  store
[5413.94 --> 5418.50]  I don't know it'd be weird. It'd be weird. That would be very yeah, that'd be odd. Yeah, it'd be not useful at all
[5418.50 --> 5419.86]  I prefer
[5419.86 --> 5425.06]  Googling what the best product is and getting 17 different listicle websites and then going
[5425.06 --> 5429.54]  Oh, I'll just look up reddit and then having the reddit posts be hijacked by an seo team
[5430.26 --> 5431.94]  That's what I prefer. I prefer that experience
[5434.82 --> 5438.42]  But i'm not that big brain realistically ltt store is one big tax write-off
[5439.46 --> 5441.06]  What if what if lt store
[5441.06 --> 5443.06]  Becomes trust me bro.com
[5443.78 --> 5449.30]  Uh, it probably exists already and if it didn't already exist it's going to get bought before you can get a chance to acquire it
[5449.30 --> 5453.62]  So it's done. It's out. I'm wondering if it already redirects. No, it doesn't it redirects somewhere else
[5454.74 --> 5454.82]  Oh
[5455.46 --> 5460.34]  Well, it's gone now domains for sale. All right 25 grand by the way usd
[5460.90 --> 5465.06]  Yeah, I don't think that's happening. So never mind. I mean, it'd be a good uh, write-off
[5465.06 --> 5467.06]  Um
[5470.82 --> 5472.26]  Okay, um, okay
[5473.14 --> 5475.62]  Perfection, uh, nick's working on something
[5477.14 --> 5483.14]  We don't need more. Um, sarah's sarah's busy, but uh here hold on. Oh, no
[5485.62 --> 5491.54]  Whoa, can you go to my cam for a second here or no, I go to your cam go to your cam for a second here
[5491.54 --> 5495.54]  Uh, which one zoom in my cam?
[5497.94 --> 5499.94]  What
[5504.42 --> 5507.86]  So we're generating more periwinkle ones with sharpies is that the
[5511.78 --> 5513.78]  You're untangled
[5516.18 --> 5521.14]  No, no sarah's sarah's busy so nick is making a gray product photo. Oh
[5521.54 --> 5523.54]  Okay

[5536.34 --> 5538.82]  Tax write-off shirts. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[5538.82 --> 5545.06]  Just uh, let them know that you ran out of graphic design budget like four hours ago for this project. So that's my handiwork
[5545.22 --> 5549.78]  Okay, good job. Excellent work. I did like it a lot. I will say all right, cool
[5549.78 --> 5554.98]  And if you uh, if you find any more inventory of anything else, we've got to write we've got to write them off nick

[5559.14 --> 5560.58]  I just need to confirm. I don't want
[5560.98 --> 5564.74]  You know a bunch of people to expect they're getting a write-off t-shirt and then to get a you know, a write-off
[5564.74 --> 5570.98]  Uh, saying that we don't have that t-shirt so sure. I mean, do you want to just put mystery color in there and then uh

[5684.58 --> 5687.38]  Yeah, hey guys, I appreciate your quality scripts
[5687.38 --> 5692.74]  I'm curious if you did well in your school writing classes or if that skill came later
[5693.06 --> 5696.66]  Also, when and why did you decide to hire your first staff writer?
[5697.94 --> 5704.90]  Huh first staff writer. I mean really realistically luke was kind of supposed to be like a writer slash episode prepper
[5704.90 --> 5713.14]  From not not at ncix, but oh, yeah from day zero of linus media group. Yeah
[5713.14 --> 5716.90]  And then the next one after that was john martin
[5717.54 --> 5719.22]  Yes, and that wasn't until
[5720.10 --> 5722.34]  Right before we moved out of the langley house. Yeah
[5722.90 --> 5726.82]  We tried to hire like a helper benchmarker for luke before that
[5727.38 --> 5729.30]  Yeah, that didn't work out. It did not work out
[5729.30 --> 5736.34]  Um, whether it was because we didn't know exactly what position we needed or whether we don't really have the have the
[5736.82 --> 5740.18]  Hiring practices nailed down yet might have been a problem. That could have been an issue
[5740.82 --> 5745.14]  Um, that was I think I that was I think the first person luke ever fired. Yes
[5746.10 --> 5750.18]  Um, I wasn't even in town. I think I was overseas to get fired from the company
[5750.18 --> 5752.34]  And it was the first person that I fired
[5752.90 --> 5758.74]  Yeah, linus was like on vacation or something and I had to call him and be like yeah, so by the way, this is happening
[5760.26 --> 5762.26]  Which is an interesting one for sure
[5762.74 --> 5768.58]  Um, please tell the story. I I think we're no no, I mean we did we're not looking to identify or shame anyone
[5768.58 --> 5776.18]  It just it involved falling asleep at work multiple times. Yeah, i'll say that much and that should be all you really need to know
[5776.50 --> 5778.34]  Yeah, yeah, well
[5779.14 --> 5785.46]  Also paired with other things that actually wasn't the only problem. No, but it was all they need to know. Yeah
[5787.22 --> 5789.22]  Anyways
[5790.26 --> 5798.02]  Uh, oh oh crap. Um, oh my goodness, uh, but uh, but okay, I will deal with this later. It's fine. That's fine
[5798.02 --> 5800.10]  Just my wife. Um, okay
[5800.82 --> 5805.14]  So do you want to hit us with another merch message with intel's upcoming move to arrow lake?
[5805.14 --> 5808.98]  What do you think the impact of removing hyper threading will be for performance?
[5810.02 --> 5813.38]  Honestly with how many cores we have in desktop processors now
[5813.38 --> 5817.38]  I'm not convinced that there's going to be a significant impact
[5818.18 --> 5818.50]  um
[5819.94 --> 5822.10]  Like in intel I I think
[5822.10 --> 5825.14]  Don't quote me on this because everything's everything's still rumors at this point
[5825.14 --> 5827.78]  But I think the plan is to keep core counts pretty constant
[5827.78 --> 5831.06]  If they make the kind of expected improvements
[5831.62 --> 5833.94]  Um to their efficiency cores
[5834.50 --> 5836.50]  Uh, like if those get significantly faster
[5836.50 --> 5840.34]  Honestly, I would rather use the power budget not to mention
[5840.82 --> 5843.38]  the the die budget the area budget
[5844.18 --> 5849.46]  Um, i'd rather they use it to juice up the efficiency cores and give me more multi-threaded performance that way
[5849.46 --> 5856.26]  Compared to giving me a secondary thread on my performance cores that realistically
[5856.98 --> 5863.54]  Is not contributing to overall system responsiveness and system performance the way that it used to
[5863.54 --> 5870.02]  When intel was going up against amd or an amd had single core processors with no smt
[5870.50 --> 5873.22]  Um simultaneous multi-threading hyper threading
[5873.54 --> 5877.38]  um the difference like as an amd fanboy
[5877.38 --> 5878.42]  Who?
[5879.54 --> 5882.50]  Like kind of willfully it was like la la la at the time, okay?
[5882.50 --> 5886.02]  I I hadn't figured out how stupid fanboyism was yet
[5886.82 --> 5889.62]  I was legitimately kind of upset
[5890.66 --> 5892.18]  When I got my first
[5892.98 --> 5894.74]  Intel that era system
[5895.38 --> 5895.62]  Um
[5896.58 --> 5901.46]  And it was like just a screw around with system. It was like an older p4 northwood that I was like
[5901.46 --> 5903.70]  Oh, i'm gonna overclock this not out of this thing. It'll be kind of funny
[5903.70 --> 5907.06]  I'll hit like a super high frequency, but I was rocking athlon 64 at the time
[5907.38 --> 5911.22]  Athlon 64 was so sick and I got this thing running. I went holy
[5912.50 --> 5914.50]  Hyper threading is night and day. Yeah
[5915.14 --> 5916.82]  In windows xp
[5916.82 --> 5918.66]  When we only had one core
[5919.86 --> 5921.86]  The difference in responsiveness
[5921.86 --> 5924.58]  It was was noticeable and I was like oh man
[5925.38 --> 5930.66]  And that was one of the things that made me so certain that dual core was something that I
[5931.38 --> 5937.30]  Needed in my life because if that's what just a little bit of extra efficiency on my one core is going to do for me
[5937.94 --> 5939.38]  Man two cores
[5939.94 --> 5940.66]  Let's go
[5940.66 --> 5945.14]  But we're at a point now where it's not like that anymore every processor for sale today
[5945.38 --> 5948.34]  Pretty much has more than one processing core
[5948.34 --> 5951.70]  And so you're not getting that that night and day difference
[5951.70 --> 5956.18]  You're getting a marginal difference in certain workloads and it's coming at a cost of complexity and power
[5956.90 --> 5958.02]  um
[5958.02 --> 5964.66]  I'm honestly a little surprised that amd chased them to smt and as far as I know amd doesn't have any plans to get rid of it
[5964.66 --> 5969.06]  But not every implementation is built equal and amd is certainly not as uh
[5969.70 --> 5972.58]  Constrained in their power budgets these days as intel is so
[5972.58 --> 5977.86]  The only answer that I can give that I am certain about is that we will see
[5978.74 --> 5980.74]  And that i'm excited to see how it turns out
[5982.50 --> 5987.38]  Nick just live editing the store is like one of my favorite things now
[5988.10 --> 5992.18]  Oh my god, it's just mystery and then a bunch of question marks
[5992.74 --> 5994.82]  And then the picture for it
[5997.46 --> 5998.26]  Oh man
[5998.26 --> 6006.82]  This is so good the hilarious thing is like t-shirts are not even something that are problematic
[6007.06 --> 6011.78]  Like we don't as you can tell we only had like a few hundred of these shirts so like whatever
[6012.18 --> 6015.62]  There was really no point especially once you started adding gray
[6016.10 --> 6018.58]  There's just no way luke it's a write-off though
[6019.54 --> 6021.54]  Luke it's a write-off
[6023.22 --> 6027.94]  If nick can think of if nick's watching funny until there was actually financial consequences
[6027.94 --> 6033.78]  And then it was so not funny for me anymore if nick's watching right now if there's anything else you want to write off
[6033.78 --> 6035.62]  That's not a t-shirt. Just let me know
[6036.42 --> 6041.38]  Just let me know let me know maybe maybe maybe just one day one day
[6043.06 --> 6044.82]  Oh my god these hoodies though
[6045.54 --> 6051.06]  Short circuit color blocks sold out tech link color blocks sold out ltt color blocks sold out. I wonder why
[6052.18 --> 6054.98]  Well, I just I don't know I thought we had I thought we had more of these
[6054.98 --> 6057.54]  The tech wiki one still for sale dollar hoodie
[6058.02 --> 6060.98]  Well, yeah, it's a great hoodie. It's a quality hoodie luke
[6061.86 --> 6067.94]  We gave one to ludwig. He was like this nice hoodie. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it's quality nice hoodie. Yeah, if you can
[6070.50 --> 6075.62]  Nick if if you can find any more hoodies, uh, make sure that they're sufficiently written off
[6076.42 --> 6079.62]  Let's get them written off because of the vaude people. They're not going to get anything
[6079.62 --> 6085.38]  They're gonna get no write-offs luke watch live. Okay, uh, let's do another topic. What do you want to talk?
[6085.38 --> 6089.86]  You live in like europe or something just wake up at like four in the morning. Yeah, exactly watch the wansh

[6299.70 --> 6302.34]  I know faster than that sometimes
[6302.98 --> 6305.94]  Can we just some merch messages so I don't have to do this again for an hour?
[6307.86 --> 6308.98]  Uh, okay
[6309.70 --> 6312.10]  I'm unprepared for the thing that I wanted to do
[6312.82 --> 6314.82]  Uh brain where are you?
[6315.30 --> 6320.82]  Hello boys, luke, I've got to know what are the origins of the bye at the end of the show?
[6321.14 --> 6325.86]  I know krista on level one text does it as well. Did one of you start it? Does it predate you both?
[6325.86 --> 6334.26]  I have a feeling this is one of those situations, you know when like certain technologies get simultaneously invented
[6335.70 --> 6341.78]  Algebra yeah, or is it calculus? I feel like this is like one of those. I think we're just both awesome
[6342.58 --> 6344.34]  Yeah, I mean it's one of those things where
[6345.54 --> 6351.86]  Almost almost nothing you see on the internet is original. Yeah, like I had a I had a bunch of people
[6351.86 --> 6357.62]  It's literally the word by like I had a bunch of people speculating that I wore that um that brown
[6358.26 --> 6364.82]  Coat yeah, because of like because of technology connections. Yeah, and it's like you know what I love technology connections
[6365.46 --> 6368.50]  Great channel. He's super cool from what I can tell
[6369.14 --> 6374.82]  We've only corresponded by email like once and I don't know I don't I don't know a ton about him, but I know his contents great
[6375.70 --> 6378.02]  But no, I've had that jacket for
[6378.02 --> 6384.34]  Almost 10 years the first time I wore it. Um, I can't I can't I couldn't find it. I went looking for it
[6384.34 --> 6385.94]  That's why I sent you that weird. Um
[6386.74 --> 6391.30]  That weird picture of you as funk man. We used to do these commercials for the gaming brand funk
[6392.02 --> 6393.46]  and um
[6393.62 --> 6397.86]  At some point was it for a funk video that I wore the suit
[6398.98 --> 6403.70]  Yeah, I think it was one of the mouse ones I that's what I thought too, but I couldn't find it
[6403.70 --> 6410.58]  I didn't I didn't realize he wore oh he does have that jacket. Yeah, it seems to be basically exactly the same jacket
[6411.14 --> 6416.50]  Um, but the first time I wore it was like oh, it was somewhere between nine and ten years ago
[6416.50 --> 6423.38]  I got it at value village for like eight dollars because I needed sort of a a salesman looking jacket
[6423.38 --> 6425.70]  But i'm kind of down on my luck
[6426.10 --> 6431.94]  Um, and it was sort of based on the simpsons character gill and it's like it it doesn't it doesn't matter
[6431.94 --> 6439.14]  I'm not in a it's it's not like a a competition for who thought of it first because neither of us thought of it first
[6439.14 --> 6444.74]  Yeah, the idea of wearing a costume of wearing a jacket that sort of says
[6445.78 --> 6450.42]  Professor who doesn't spend any money on clothing is not one that either of us invented
[6450.42 --> 6454.82]  It's just it's just a thing that we have both done on occasion
[6455.22 --> 6457.22]  um love his channel and
[6457.22 --> 6465.38]  Any resemblance I guess is a happy accident, but yeah, no, it's definitely and definitely an accident. I'm trying to find it right now. I uh
[6466.58 --> 6472.10]  Have so far been unsuccessful, but yeah, i'm trying to find it. Yeah, I I wasn't able to find it. Okay. Yeah
[6472.10 --> 6476.74]  I wasn't sure how extensively you looked I I looked okay. I'm not even bothered
[6476.74 --> 6478.74]  Then
[6482.58 --> 6484.90]  Here we go. This is the video that I sent luke though
[6485.86 --> 6486.58]  um
[6486.58 --> 6488.42]  I think this is the one oh my god
[6489.86 --> 6490.26]  Stuh
[6492.34 --> 6495.46]  So this is a behind the scenes of the production
[6496.34 --> 6496.90]  um
[6497.70 --> 6500.90]  Blah blah blah. This is not the one you sent me. Oh
[6500.90 --> 6502.26]  different one
[6502.26 --> 6505.70]  It's kb4. I thought the kb460 was the one that had uh
[6506.42 --> 6508.34]  the one you sent me we were at the parents place
[6514.58 --> 6516.66]  I didn't remember this I just remembered my like
[6517.22 --> 6523.22]  pretending that my hand was burning on the mouse I didn't remember being in it. No, that was this is for a keyboard luke. Oh, right. Yeah
[6525.22 --> 6527.94]  So I couldn't remember a ton of this stuff dude
[6529.94 --> 6531.94]  When was this?
[6532.26 --> 6544.26]  Anyway, um, so I came across a bunch of the old funk stuff when I was looking for this. Uh, oh
[6544.82 --> 6549.30]  Hey, here's hey, yeah, here's the actual um ad someone uh re-uploaded it
[6550.42 --> 6552.74]  Oh, so here hold on where's angry luke at
[6554.42 --> 6557.38]  I did it it had kind of oh wait. Oh, here it is
[6558.42 --> 6560.42]  hey
[6560.58 --> 6568.50]  Yeah, so this was shot nine years ago. Yeah, and that's the first appearance of of the jacket. Am I picking my nose and smearing it on the window?
[6568.50 --> 6570.50]  Uh, yeah
[6575.30 --> 6575.94]  I
[6575.94 --> 6578.50]  I don't remember any of the context for
[6579.30 --> 6584.50]  For that. Oh, I was pitching a campaign. Yeah, I think it's like
[6585.38 --> 6588.98]  different varieties of like features that the product could have or something
[6592.50 --> 6594.50]  Anyway, um
[6595.46 --> 6596.50]  Yeah, sweet
[6596.50 --> 6600.02]  That's sweet. We've done some weird stuff over the years. Sure have
[6600.82 --> 6603.06]  We've done some really weird sh** over the years
[6604.50 --> 6606.66]  When you sent me me dressed as funk man
[6606.66 --> 6610.82]  All of that came back real quick. Yeah
[6610.82 --> 6614.90]  Why we went in the pool didn't we? Yeah, I don't remember why but you did like uh
[6614.90 --> 6620.90]  You did like a coming out of the pool and then like the glue that we used to glue all the fake chest hair onto you
[6620.90 --> 6622.74]  Like started coming off. It's a whole thing
[6623.78 --> 6629.54]  Oh, I think we got one shot at that shot. Oh, this is so cool. Okay. This is a teaser for an upcoming video
[6629.54 --> 6636.66]  Um, jake is working on an ai tool for processing our entire
[6637.22 --> 6641.62]  Bat catalog of footage. Yeah into its searchable database. Yeah, yeah, so you can be like
[6642.42 --> 6643.62]  luke
[6643.62 --> 6648.58]  Holding a keyboard and it'll bring up every clip of luke holding a keyboard. This is
[6650.18 --> 6655.30]  Crazy cool. There are tools for this out there already. I know no, no, we okay like that
[6655.94 --> 6659.30]  Messing with one. He's not making one. No, okay. No, no, no, no. Yeah, no
[6659.30 --> 6661.30]  We we have a video coming
[6661.30 --> 6666.10]  It's oh, so cool and combined with the ultra fast storage video
[6666.10 --> 6673.30]  Do you feel like incredibly vindicated now for keeping everything? Yeah, no, no even now we're not gonna use it like most of the time
[6674.10 --> 6676.10]  but if we're ever looking for
[6676.98 --> 6678.98]  Alex in a workshop
[6679.62 --> 6688.74]  Well, yeah, but it narrows it down a lot compared to mvi underscore zero zero seven eight dot. Totally. Yeah, it's it's a totally
[6689.30 --> 6691.30]  different ball game
[6691.30 --> 6697.14]  Very excited. No, we're not gonna upload every video clip to google photos. That's not how that works. Oh my goodness
[6697.14 --> 6699.70]  I'd have to buy petabytes of storage on google photos
[6700.26 --> 6702.26]  um
[6702.26 --> 6704.26]  um
[6706.74 --> 6708.26]  Okay
[6708.26 --> 6713.86]  Okay, he's adding more he found some more pink and periwinkle, and he's adding some more crazy shit
[6714.98 --> 6716.98]  We're gonna write it off
[6720.10 --> 6722.98]  Don't even think about asking to have an order edited because
[6723.38 --> 6729.46]  Everything will be gone before you even get a chance just if you want an order for any of this stuff get it in there
[6729.86 --> 6731.86]  um
[6731.86 --> 6733.86]  Oh, man
[6733.86 --> 6739.14]  Oh man, it's the right off sale dude. Why it's the right off sale?
[6740.34 --> 6743.30]  Um, okay another merch message a new topic
[6744.74 --> 6748.58]  I'm kind of thinking about making this an annual event. It's around tax time
[6750.66 --> 6752.50]  The pre-tax time write-off event
[6753.06 --> 6756.98]  Why wouldn't you do post tax time because then people get their their tax returns?
[6756.98 --> 6762.82]  Because I I'm concerned about my tax returns. I gotta write it off. It's about us luke. Yeah, it's not about them
[6763.38 --> 6765.54]  Yeah, I've got stuff to write off
[6767.30 --> 6768.90]  Okay, um
[6768.90 --> 6771.78]  What's the what's the next topic? How do I get out of here?
[6772.34 --> 6775.22]  How do I get us to write off less than the doors over there?
[6775.62 --> 6781.62]  Yeah, dan said we need merch messages. I just can do whatever I need a break. Technically the card says merch messages
[6781.62 --> 6785.70]  All right now it says two to three
[6786.58 --> 6788.58]  It's move on luke
[6788.58 --> 6789.94]  Get over it
[6789.94 --> 6791.86]  Okay, uh, airbnbs
[6791.86 --> 6799.22]  Bans snooping airbnb will be banning indoor security cameras and other recording devices from rental listings beginning april 30th
[6799.46 --> 6804.02]  They will also now require host to disclose the presence of decibel monitors
[6804.02 --> 6813.46]  Yeah, so many hosts have policies for their airbnbs that you can't have a party or you can't have too many people over
[6813.86 --> 6819.86]  So you can set up a decibel monitor to notify you if the noise level goes above a certain amount
[6820.42 --> 6822.66]  Or if they're going real hard. Yeah
[6824.10 --> 6830.42]  Like there could be a variety of things that could or or if they have a pet so a barking dog would trigger it as well
[6830.42 --> 6836.34]  So there's a variety of reasons that hosts might include decibel meters in their suites. Anyway carry on. Yeah
[6837.30 --> 6837.78]  um
[6837.78 --> 6845.06]  Airbnb's previous policy was to merely limit the use of cameras to common areas and require that they are not
[6845.62 --> 6847.22]  Require that they are not hidden
[6847.46 --> 6853.06]  But it didn't require that the host disclose their location or whether or not they were inside or outside
[6853.38 --> 6858.34]  There was likewise an ambiguity over spaces that weren't bedrooms, but nonetheless certain
[6858.34 --> 6863.14]  Uh nonetheless, sorry contain a couch or futon sufficient for sleeping
[6863.38 --> 6869.62]  This ambiguity has led to problems like cameras being placed inappropriately close to the entrance of bathrooms
[6870.26 --> 6876.74]  Airbnb likewise has a spotty track record of responding to complaints about surveillance as
[6877.22 --> 6882.90]  Exemplified by a 2019 report of a family finding a hidden camera disguised as a smoke detector
[6882.90 --> 6887.70]  Where the host was initially exonerated then later banned and the family refunded?
[6888.10 --> 6892.10]  I'm pretty sure that was after they like blew it up on twitter or something. Yeah
[6892.42 --> 6898.82]  Um, it would just I don't believe this happened naturally discussion question is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow
[6899.14 --> 6902.66]  And the footage from surveillance cameras inside of his rental property
[6904.82 --> 6906.74]  No, it's obviously bs honestly
[6906.74 --> 6912.98]  Well, I mean for me, I just don't feel like this um, is gonna do anything
[6912.98 --> 6918.26]  No, because if people really wanted like the the like dirty cameras they were trying to hide them anyways
[6918.26 --> 6922.58]  Yeah, um and so I just don't really I don't really understand
[6923.30 --> 6928.34]  The point of of this policy change. I mean I yeah, I guess I think it's a policy
[6928.34 --> 6929.78]  Yeah, they can ban people more easily
[6929.78 --> 6933.30]  But I think it's I think it's more about plausible deniability for airbnb
[6933.94 --> 6941.38]  And covering their own legal liability than it is about actually protecting the users because the hidden cameras are the users like what I want to know
[6941.94 --> 6943.94]  is
[6944.02 --> 6950.10]  What is what what is what is the enforcement of this look like because hidden cameras are already banned
[6950.66 --> 6957.22]  But as far as I can tell it's the hidden cameras that are the actual problem
[6957.22 --> 6961.38]  You sold me on this. I was like no this this makes sense. This will help somewhat and yeah
[6961.38 --> 6966.02]  No, not at all because people that were doing this nefariously were already hiding it
[6966.42 --> 6970.26]  Um, and that was already against the rules. So this is like this is like
[6971.62 --> 6974.02]  Banning the appropriate that's not even appropriate
[6974.66 --> 6980.34]  Banning the not really that bad, but still bad part of something but leaving the really bad part of it just fine
[6980.34 --> 6983.62]  Because it was already banned and people were already circumvented. Well, it's one of those things. It's like
[6984.50 --> 6986.90]  It's a really bad analogy, but i'm sure there's a good analogy out there
[6986.90 --> 6994.50]  The point the point is just that um, you're you're not really you're not really keeping the the narrative wells
[6994.50 --> 6996.66]  Yeah, from continuing to do what they were doing. Yeah
[6997.14 --> 7005.30]  Um, and we're gonna break the law anyways honestly unless airbnb is doing any actual auditing on their operators
[7005.86 --> 7010.50]  I don't see how they're going to affect any kind of meaningful change. There's no way they're going to
[7010.50 --> 7012.50]  I
[7012.74 --> 7013.78]  There's there's no way
[7015.14 --> 7020.50]  They could have a system where they have like a small team of people that like randomly checks in on airbnbs
[7020.74 --> 7022.74]  But there's no way they could do all of them
[7022.74 --> 7027.70]  And here's a problem for me is that if I was an airbnb operator, which i'm not
[7028.42 --> 7031.54]  I feel like this could push me underground
[7031.54 --> 7038.74]  Because there is no possible way that I would have a property particularly one that i'm not living at
[7039.06 --> 7041.54]  Like if I had a like if I had let's say for example
[7041.54 --> 7045.70]  I had a vacation property that I didn't live at full-time and I airbnb'd
[7045.70 --> 7050.10]  11 months out of the year and I used occasionally I don't but let's say that I did
[7051.62 --> 7053.30]  What i'm not going to have
[7053.30 --> 7058.26]  Functionally any surveillance cameras even in the very common areas
[7058.98 --> 7065.06]  So i'm not going to have any record if say for example, uh a fire was started in the kitchen. Oh, yeah
[7065.62 --> 7069.22]  This is like so can I play like kind of devil's advocate here a little bit and kind of go?
[7069.22 --> 7072.26]  Okay, so then what is my recourse well now?
[7072.74 --> 7078.34]  Because there's absolutely no way that i'm not going to have at least a camera in a kitchen
[7078.34 --> 7084.42]  If I if I was an operator which i'm not because partly because i'd be paranoid about this kind of thing
[7084.58 --> 7087.70]  this is this I think your reasoning there is fair and
[7088.34 --> 7095.70]  Good, but I think the ultimate answer is that the golden days very bnb is like over and people should just go back to cheap hotels
[7096.74 --> 7101.38]  Okay, you skipped ahead in our conversation a little bit. I wanted to play devil's advocate for a little bit longer
[7101.70 --> 7103.62]  Yeah, but I think I think it's fair. I mean yeah
[7103.70 --> 7107.54]  If you don't live there if there's no other way to observe because like at a hotel
[7108.50 --> 7112.02]  Yeah, you don't have cameras inside the rooms, but you have cameras in the hallways
[7112.58 --> 7117.14]  in the common areas and there and the common areas and you have hotel staff that are working there
[7117.14 --> 7123.54]  So you have some amount of there's attendance a level of expectation that somebody is on hand to deal with a problem
[7123.62 --> 7128.02]  But if nobody is on hand to deal with a problem kevin s and floatplane says isn't that what's insurance for?
[7128.34 --> 7132.82]  Yeah, but do you know how much lower your insurance premiums are if you have cameras?
[7132.82 --> 7142.02]  If you and do you have any idea what how much easier that conversation is going to go with your insurance provider
[7142.26 --> 7144.42]  If you have photographic proof of what happened
[7145.78 --> 7149.94]  Absolutely, so no yeah the yes insurance is
[7149.94 --> 7156.10]  That is exactly why I would want to make sure that I have cameras in in particular zones
[7156.10 --> 7163.46]  Do you need there's some do you need a camera mounted to the bottom of your hot tub at a 45 degree angle toward the seat?
[7163.46 --> 7164.26]  Hmm. No
[7164.26 --> 7169.30]  No, obviously not is that a thing that's happened. I don't know what pro I mean you name it
[7169.30 --> 7170.98]  Some perv has put a camera in it probably
[7171.70 --> 7175.30]  But the point that i'm trying to make is that there are legitimate places
[7175.30 --> 7179.86]  Where if I was an airbnb operator i'd be looking at this going okay?
[7180.50 --> 7184.66]  Well now i'm not allowed to do this so i'm just gonna do it sneakier
[7185.38 --> 7186.98]  um and you know man, I
[7187.62 --> 7195.70]  I think about the tech savviness of the average person and for every airbnb owner with a hidden camera who gets busted by a really savvy
[7196.34 --> 7197.94]  renter
[7197.94 --> 7203.14]  There's got to be a hundred or a thousand that don't there was one interesting idea
[7203.14 --> 7206.18]  Uh, someone said bring a travel router and unplug theirs
[7207.94 --> 7212.98]  Yeah, that's that's not a bad idea pretty decent idea to be honest. That's like pretty solid actually. Yeah
[7213.78 --> 7221.30]  Um, I don't know where the message went so sorry. I can't quote your name. Yeah, this is another thing nova frost says the hidden cameras are mostly nefarious actors
[7221.70 --> 7225.78]  Installing them without the owner knowing about them. I think that that's probably a lot of it
[7225.78 --> 7230.10]  But I also think that that's a lot of excuses. It's a very good excuse
[7230.10 --> 7234.74]  And I mean here's another thing like I would definitely want a camera pointed at
[7235.62 --> 7238.66]  My internet setup. I've got a camera pointed at my rack right now
[7240.42 --> 7242.58]  You do technically of course I do yeah
[7243.14 --> 7247.46]  I have at least three cameras pointed at racks that belong to me right now because
[7248.10 --> 7253.46]  And ones that don't even if all you want to know is are the activity leds on that working
[7253.46 --> 7255.54]  Like if your internet's up, but something else is wrong
[7255.54 --> 7263.38]  Like there's are the fans spinning on that server is that server on or not like there's a there's a hundred reasons that you would want a camera pointed at your rack
[7263.62 --> 7265.62]  Yeah
[7266.42 --> 7270.10]  Like say you're a twitch streamer for example. Sorry. Um, anyway the point
[7270.98 --> 7272.98]  the point i'm trying to make is that
[7273.14 --> 7275.46]  um
[7275.46 --> 7279.86]  I would consider it to be unacceptable for me to not for me to not
[7279.86 --> 7286.66]  Be able to monitor if someone is messing with the networking in the airbnb and potentially endangering future guests
[7287.46 --> 7289.46]  So it's like okay
[7289.46 --> 7291.70]  Well, what's the what's the middle ground here?
[7292.26 --> 7296.58]  I'll just not i'll just not airbnb my house. Yes. Thank you. We know you've got to the
[7297.06 --> 7299.14]  We know you've got the answer loop god
[7299.70 --> 7303.22]  Hostels are fun and super cheap. I've stayed at a hostel for 30 bucks
[7304.10 --> 7306.10]  And it was cool met some cool people
[7306.10 --> 7310.18]  Often get really good suggestions of like places go place to eat things to go see
[7311.54 --> 7316.18]  I understand that you don't do that. I understand that nick has found some more things to write off
[7316.18 --> 7318.90]  Oh, no, uh, what are we what are we looking at here?
[7319.54 --> 7321.86]  Okay, so the tax write-off shirt
[7322.58 --> 7324.58]  um
[7324.66 --> 7330.02]  Oh, okay. Oh, it's actually not clear that that's a that that's an option, but okay, sure whatever mystery
[7330.26 --> 7335.54]  Okay, so a periwinkle and pink. Oh, man. Did he bring them back and are they already gone again?
[7336.10 --> 7340.18]  Okay, well, there's some gray my goodness. There's still there's still some gray and
[7341.14 --> 7345.30]  Mystery definitely exists and then what what else is going on here?
[7345.78 --> 7348.90]  Uh, oh my god. He's adding more things
[7349.62 --> 7354.98]  Uh, what do you have? Okay, things are things are getting a little bit crazy. I'm not sure where do I find all the tax?
[7354.98 --> 7360.74]  You know what? I give up. Let's burn it down faster. What is it? Oh, here we go. What's on sale? Okay?
[7360.74 --> 7366.26]  Uh, tax write-off shirt. Oh, okay. Okay, so here's everything in the tax write-off sale
[7366.26 --> 7367.46]  Oh, wow
[7367.46 --> 7367.78]  Uh
[7367.78 --> 7368.82]  That's a thing you can do?
[7370.18 --> 7370.50]  What?
[7371.46 --> 7373.78]  Like view all of the crazy discounts?
[7374.26 --> 7375.06]  I guess so
[7375.06 --> 7381.94]  Uh, okay. Oh, he says hold on. He says hold on. Hold on in all caps. There's an extra I in there
[7381.94 --> 7387.14]  Okay, let's do another topic then shall we sure yeah, hold on hold on to yourself
[7388.50 --> 7390.82]  This is gonna hurt like I'm sorry
[7391.62 --> 7397.70]  That's a fairly quick topic euai regulations the european parliament has voted to adopt the euai act
[7397.70 --> 7399.30]  This is crazy
[7399.30 --> 7403.78]  Like the unit count keeps going up like wild, but the revenue doesn't go up
[7403.78 --> 7409.22]  And the profit goes down good good. This is good. Okay
[7409.38 --> 7413.30]  We needed to offset any gain that the company might have from the magnets
[7414.02 --> 7419.14]  Like it would have gone to our heads. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay ourselves leveled
[7419.46 --> 7421.46]  Um, the yeah, anyways
[7421.46 --> 7426.82]  European parliament they voted to adopt the euai act which bans ai enabled social scoring
[7427.30 --> 7433.70]  Exploitative behavior engineering and emotion recognition systems at work or school and limits
[7433.78 --> 7435.78]  Law enforcement's use of biometrics
[7436.42 --> 7444.34]  Except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations. Not sure what exhaustively listed means exhaustively listed means
[7444.34 --> 7447.06]  That the list is all-inclusive
[7448.58 --> 7451.14]  So it it it includes every
[7451.94 --> 7453.94]  Allowed scenario
[7454.02 --> 7458.50]  So that there's no ambiguity in the interpretation of when it's allowed. I understand. Okay, okay
[7459.14 --> 7466.18]  The act also includes stricter scrutiny and transparency requirements based on the potential risk of an ai system
[7466.42 --> 7474.10]  Some have criticized the act as for going too far and placing european ai firms at a disadvantage in terms of development and raising capital
[7474.42 --> 7481.14]  It will be some time before the new law does take effect with its new provisions rolling out in phases over the course of the next two
[7481.86 --> 7482.34]  years
[7482.34 --> 7484.98]  Yeah
[7484.98 --> 7493.86]  Yeah, personally, i'm not super worried about the poor companies not being able to raise capital so that they can make exploitative behavioral engineering systems
[7494.66 --> 7495.78]  but
[7495.78 --> 7496.98]  um
[7496.98 --> 7501.30]  ai enabled social scoring. Oh my god all of these things are like
[7502.18 --> 7502.98]  horrible
[7502.98 --> 7507.86]  Yeah, emotion recognition systems at work or school. Meanwhile in america
[7507.86 --> 7509.62]  You've got cars
[7510.26 --> 7513.06]  rating your driving patterns and probably using
[7513.94 --> 7519.06]  machine learning models to determine what your insurance like in order to determine
[7519.62 --> 7520.58]  um, you know
[7520.58 --> 7528.18]  All right, would be the insurance companies that are probably using some kind of machine learning to take that massive amount of data and distill it down into
[7528.18 --> 7530.18]  How much your premium should be?
[7530.18 --> 7533.22]  America has got some stuff to figure out
[7534.18 --> 7539.54]  And to be clear look, I I always feel like I have to do this where anytime i'm calling out
[7540.02 --> 7542.66]  You know the problems that exist in america
[7542.90 --> 7544.90]  So many of our own problems
[7544.90 --> 7550.98]  We have we have lots of our own problems. We're we're we got problems. Okay. We're problem. We're problem bros
[7551.30 --> 7554.66]  I've been sick for a month to get an appointment with my family doctor
[7554.66 --> 7560.82]  It takes longer than a month and when I went to the clinic, uh, I had a maximum of five minutes
[7560.82 --> 7564.66]  I was able to see the doctor for okay your doctor sucks. My answer was
[7565.14 --> 7568.02]  Uh, I don't know something viral and then they kicked me out
[7569.38 --> 7572.98]  Yeah, your doctor blows chunks canada in case you're wondering yeah
[7573.06 --> 7578.98]  Mine's actually really good, but it can be hard to find one. It's what do you buy a vancouver really good? Like you can see them quickly?
[7579.38 --> 7583.54]  Uh, if we really need to we can see them in a pretty reasonable amount of time
[7583.54 --> 7589.14]  That's the problem all my symptoms have been mostly pretty mild. Yes, so they really need to is not there
[7589.22 --> 7591.22]  It would be so it takes over a month. It would be a few weeks
[7591.22 --> 7595.54]  But there's absolutely no way that she would like kick me out after five minutes or whatever. No, no, no
[7595.54 --> 7600.34]  That's the walk-in clinic. Oh, the walk-in clinics are terrible. Yeah, my family doctor doesn't kick you out right away
[7600.34 --> 7606.10]  Yeah, it just takes forever unless you have very serious symptoms going on it takes forever to not walk in clinics forget it
[7606.34 --> 7610.18]  It's I if I need to be seen quite just if I'm sick for multiple weeks
[7610.18 --> 7614.98]  I don't want to like if I'm talking to you and other people about like why I'm still sick
[7614.98 --> 7617.70]  I don't want to be like yeah, and I haven't gone to see anyone
[7617.94 --> 7622.42]  Yeah, so I went to the the the walk-in clinic is like more of a formality than anything
[7622.42 --> 7624.42]  I kind of knew there was gonna be nothing
[7624.82 --> 7630.42]  Good coming from that unless I can tell them what's wrong with me. It's basically useless if I'm like hey
[7630.42 --> 7634.34]  I have this I need this thing and they're like, uh, yeah, that seems about right here. You go
[7634.42 --> 7638.10]  They'll like write me a thing. Yeah, just just take some ivermectin and then you're good to go nice
[7638.10 --> 7640.42]  No more worms. Yeah, drink some bleach
[7641.46 --> 7647.46]  Do not do either of those things. I mean if if I did drink bleach, I don't think I would be sick anymore. Yeah
[7649.30 --> 7650.74]  You'd have a condition of some sort
[7650.74 --> 7652.74]  problem solved
[7652.74 --> 7656.58]  Not medical advice. He's coming. He's come up with an acute case of rigor mortis
[7656.58 --> 7669.06]  I'm gonna type i'm gonna type that yeah, I know I know yeah, yeah, yeah
[7669.14 --> 7672.58]  It's it's it's it's localized below the waist we get it
[7674.82 --> 7678.90]  All right, you got it. Oh, man, I don't even have to tell jokes anymore
[7679.38 --> 7682.34]  Just laugh hard enough and linus knows what i'm thinking. Yeah, well
[7682.34 --> 7685.86]  Oh, anyways, um next topic
[7688.18 --> 7692.34]  Weird notebook check article about our video. Yeah, this is super weird
[7694.18 --> 7701.06]  The original version of it credited this photo to playstation which I thought was really interesting
[7701.06 --> 7704.42]  Oh, yeah, no, I did see this so they've made at least one change to it
[7704.98 --> 7706.98]  um
[7707.30 --> 7713.54]  Everything about this is super weird well-known tech youtuber declares ps5 dead
[7713.86 --> 7719.54]  wants to provide proof by building his own pc for the same price and fails all along the line
[7720.02 --> 7726.90]  So this appears to be in reference to our it's time to kill the playstation 5 video where we made a
[7728.18 --> 7730.18]  um, like a secondhand crack
[7730.18 --> 7736.26]  um, like a secondhand crack at taking a ps5 budget and trying to build a pc that is competitive and
[7736.26 --> 7736.42]  Yeah
[7736.42 --> 7742.82]  ultimately came to the conclusion that the ps5 xbox series x generation for a variety of reasons
[7743.14 --> 7747.22]  have held on to their better value than an equivalently priced pc title
[7747.78 --> 7754.26]  much longer than expected and longer than previous generations and that if you wanted to buy with brand new hardware
[7754.82 --> 7760.58]  You are still better off buying a ps5 than you are today. However, if you're willing to
[7761.22 --> 7767.70]  Dive into the secondhand market and put something together yourself. You can get competitive. It is possible today
[7767.70 --> 7770.98]  But you'll have to be a little bit patient and try to find a deal
[7772.34 --> 7773.22]  so
[7773.22 --> 7775.14]  the writer took all of that
[7775.94 --> 7777.94]  and came away with
[7778.74 --> 7779.46]  um
[7779.46 --> 7785.86]  That it requires compromises that hardly any gamer would make. I guess they've never been to a LAN party because yeah, I
[7786.58 --> 7792.10]  So I had not watched the video sure, but I did skim this and I found that line and was like, huh
[7792.26 --> 7798.02]  So I went and looked at the parts list and genuinely started out for a while being like what if this would I not do?
[7799.70 --> 7807.54]  This all seems quite reasonable. I don't understand the number of trash tier inherited cases that I have seen at LAN parties. Yeah
[7807.54 --> 7816.26]  Outnumbers the nice brand new ones guys. There was an area where there would be real custom systems in old Dell and HP cases
[7816.42 --> 7822.26]  At every single LAN. That would be like a quarter of the system. Of course. It was absolutely a thing. Of course there were
[7822.74 --> 7829.86]  Uh, there's no question the gaming PC offers more possibilities. TechTview wanted to prove the opposite and embarked on an ambitious experiment
[7829.86 --> 7834.50]  He put together a gaming pc that would offer better performance than the ps5 at a comparable price
[7835.06 --> 7840.02]  However, a number of difficulties arose that the youtuber had apparently not considered
[7840.34 --> 7847.70]  The project can therefore be considered a failure. I'm gonna reference you as the youtuber from now. Thank you. I love that. That's so good
[7848.34 --> 7850.34]  Here's the thing
[7850.58 --> 7852.58]  Writer of this article
[7853.14 --> 7855.86]  By the time we've uploaded the video
[7856.82 --> 7858.02]  We know the outcome
[7859.22 --> 7863.38]  This may surprise you. That's nuts. But there is a period
[7864.02 --> 7869.70]  After when we have conceived of an idea and filmed the video
[7870.74 --> 7877.94]  Where the video is filmed and all the information is known and it is being edited before it is uploaded
[7878.74 --> 7882.58]  The project is exactly what we set out to do
[7883.06 --> 7889.38]  Which was to look at what it would take to build a pc for the budget of a playstation 5
[7893.86 --> 7897.30]  So um the project was a success
[7898.26 --> 7900.74]  Because we built a pc that was
[7901.78 --> 7904.66]  Fairly equivalent to the playstation 5 in raw performance
[7904.66 --> 7909.14]  But did have compromises which we met head on
[7909.86 --> 7914.66]  Acknowledging in the video even things that most people probably wouldn't be aware of did you know for example?
[7915.46 --> 7917.94]  That hdr on intel arc is a mess
[7918.58 --> 7922.02]  No, it's because they use the standard direct x12 implementation
[7922.58 --> 7925.78]  Which many game developers don't use?
[7926.34 --> 7930.18]  Instead they use amd and nvidia's own proprietary flags
[7930.18 --> 7934.02]  Because they predate the standard implementation
[7934.58 --> 7939.62]  So you'll be playing a game on amd or nvidia hardware in hdr and hdr will work
[7939.62 --> 7942.98]  And you'll play that same game on intel and it will be all washed out
[7943.46 --> 7944.42]  You know
[7944.42 --> 7947.06]  Like it'll have that kind of log footage look
[7947.78 --> 7948.90]  Like it's not graded
[7949.46 --> 7950.66]  And that's that's a known issue
[7950.66 --> 7952.58]  It wasn't one that I knew about before this project
[7952.58 --> 7955.94]  But that's that's part of the journey of discovery of
[7955.94 --> 7960.58]  Doing things like this is is you learn it's it's a learning outcome
[7961.30 --> 7966.18]  Uh was initially able to obtain all components at a price comparable to the purchase price of the ps5 however
[7966.58 --> 7970.42]  This was only possible because the youtuber decided to buy used hardware without a warranty
[7971.22 --> 7972.50]  Oh, no
[7972.50 --> 7976.42]  The total price is not really realistic. Yes, it is. Um, this was all stuff we found
[7976.90 --> 7980.50]  Linus received the case free of charge due to signs of use signs of use
[7980.50 --> 7985.46]  I love him describing this case as having signs of use the thing was trashed
[7986.02 --> 7989.78]  Um, and getting a case for nothing is a thing you can do absolutely
[7989.78 --> 7993.54]  You just have to be patient and you have to be willing to use one that's kind of trashed
[7993.54 --> 7996.66]  Yeah, um additional costs would have to be planned for this. No, they wouldn't
[7997.22 --> 8000.74]  Um, the shipping costs for the individual components are also not included and this is true
[8001.22 --> 8005.62]  But a lot of the parts that we found in fact, we found better deals that we didn't include
[8006.26 --> 8008.82]  Because we were worried that they wouldn't be reproducible
[8009.38 --> 8014.10]  Uh, david found a way better cpu for the same price for example on facebook marketplace
[8014.10 --> 8020.26]  Which he could have gone and gotten and yes, there are some you know transit costs that you would maybe have to account to there
[8020.26 --> 8023.38]  But no, these are actually things that you could obtain
[8024.02 --> 8028.26]  It is true that we didn't account for the cost of the operating system and peripherals
[8028.26 --> 8033.22]  That is accurate, but you can use windows without paying for it even if you shouldn't
[8033.22 --> 8038.18]  Um, and we acknowledged that we didn't include the cost of peripherals
[8038.18 --> 8043.22]  We also didn't include the additional cost of buying games on the playstation store
[8044.26 --> 8048.34]  Games on playstation are more expensive by and large than buying them on pc
[8048.34 --> 8050.50]  If you wanted to play a multiplayer game wouldn't you have to buy the
[8051.06 --> 8054.74]  PS plus thing or whatever it's called as well, um, i'm not sure how it works these days
[8054.74 --> 8059.78]  I haven't I haven't daily driven a playstation basically in forever. So or basically forever
[8059.78 --> 8060.58]  um
[8062.50 --> 8064.74]  The newest playstation i own is a piece ps2
[8065.70 --> 8070.82]  That should give you some idea hey me too um buying new hardware would cost over a thousand dollars. This is true
[8070.82 --> 8072.82]  But it wasn't what we were talking about
[8072.82 --> 8077.78]  Uh, wait if you want to rebuild the pc. Sorry hold on a second if you want to rebuild the pc
[8078.26 --> 8080.90]  You have to plan for significantly higher costs
[8081.62 --> 8085.22]  If you want to rebuild it, okay, i'm i'm really not sure what that maybe they mean
[8085.22 --> 8090.26]  Like build the one that you spec'd out the advantage of gaming consoles is that they
[8090.98 --> 8094.42]  Uh are ready to use straight out of the box. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
[8096.18 --> 8097.62]  Um
[8097.62 --> 8103.62]  It is therefore unlikely many gamers would follow the youtubers example and build their own pc from used hardware instead of buying a playstation 5
[8104.18 --> 8105.06]  You're right
[8105.06 --> 8110.42]  And that's exactly our point with exercises like this and with scrapyard wars is that they should
[8110.42 --> 8116.74]  Um, and one of the scrapyard wars i made my own there's benefits guys. There's benefits to learning
[8116.74 --> 8120.58]  That's like saying a lot of people are saying it's ai generated article. No, I don't think so
[8120.58 --> 8127.70]  Yeah, I didn't actually think it was either there's there's this this article feels a little bit like saying
[8128.50 --> 8129.38]  um
[8129.38 --> 8133.22]  That we should have made a video about hiring a plumber to come and repair
[8134.02 --> 8135.46]  our sink
[8135.46 --> 8137.46]  Instead of you know
[8138.02 --> 8141.78]  Going to um to a a building materials refurbisher
[8142.26 --> 8146.34]  And buying a used sink and installing it ourselves and learning something and saving some money
[8148.98 --> 8153.38]  The are you talking about like are you are you even are you is that an interesting video
[8154.42 --> 8156.34]  Is that is that good life advice?
[8158.02 --> 8160.02]  Honestly though
[8161.22 --> 8163.22]  Is that what we should be promoting?
[8163.62 --> 8167.38]  Just have someone build it for you. Don't do anything yourself. Don't learn
[8168.26 --> 8169.30]  pay as much as you can
[8170.66 --> 8172.98]  I just I don't I don't get it
[8174.82 --> 8179.70]  We we never at any point in the video we're we're dishonest in any way
[8180.74 --> 8183.70]  I'm just going through our success or lack thereof
[8184.02 --> 8188.82]  However, you want to define that online listicles and finding free computer cases right now. I know
[8188.82 --> 8192.10]  I've found a few already not listicles listings
[8192.90 --> 8197.30]  What is listicles listicles an article that's a list. Oh, right. Yeah, don't worry about it
[8198.42 --> 8203.14]  Um, anyway, so there's I have some notes from from jessica here. Uh, wait
[8203.86 --> 8204.18]  Really?
[8204.98 --> 8206.10]  What's up?
[8206.10 --> 8210.50]  Oh, uh, jessica says I have read the article in german
[8211.06 --> 8213.06]  And it is basically the same in both languages
[8213.54 --> 8216.66]  Also, I am fairly certain the author is not an ai. I didn't know jessica
[8216.98 --> 8217.94]  was
[8218.10 --> 8220.66]  I didn't know she could read german. Okay, cool though
[8220.66 --> 8226.42]  He posts around four relatively short articles every day to notebook check usually two articles in german plus their english translations
[8226.42 --> 8228.58]  I believe this to be non suspicious. Yeah, that's fair
[8229.30 --> 8230.10]  um
[8230.98 --> 8236.34]  She also said odd factors from the article the article provides a summary that misunderstands the purpose of the video and
[8236.66 --> 8240.90]  Dismisses the project as a failure essentially because we chose to buy used hardware without a warranty
[8241.22 --> 8246.66]  It is also extremely dismissive of trying to build your own pc simply because a lot of gamers won't want to spend a lot of time
[8246.66 --> 8249.94]  On it or don't have the skill and will choose to do something else instead well
[8249.94 --> 8254.34]  I've just fair enough got a few words for the writer of that article and
[8254.98 --> 8256.98]  They are
[8256.98 --> 8260.82]  Maybe you should get good. Yeah
[8261.70 --> 8263.70]  got him
[8263.78 --> 8268.66]  Maybe the writer of the article should buy a screwdriver and get free shipping on a tax rate option
[8268.66 --> 8275.62]  Maybe your maybe your readers would be more likely to build their own pcs and save money and learn something if you promoted that instead of just
[8275.62 --> 8278.82]  Buying a console. That's a bad idea. Why do you even work at notebook check?
[8280.26 --> 8282.26]  Because you don't build your own notebook
[8282.26 --> 8289.06]  Okay, then why is notebook check even like the consoles of the computer world dude
[8289.06 --> 8294.42]  It's actually kind of a bizarre thing to me like the the the amount of coverage that
[8294.98 --> 8297.54]  Some youtubers get from traditional media
[8298.66 --> 8303.06]  Um when they do something positive versus the amount of coverage that we get when we do something positive
[8303.06 --> 8308.18]  And then how everyone how everyone is talking about it when anything negative happens with us
[8308.18 --> 8309.86]  It's like so they clearly all know who we are
[8311.06 --> 8317.70]  But only in the context of when there's something negative to report on it's it's do you think we do that with wanshow become a bit of a pattern
[8317.86 --> 8319.86]  I think we report on positive things
[8319.86 --> 8323.62]  Yeah, but like car companies we always report when they do bad stuff. Do they ever do good things?
[8323.62 --> 8324.58]  Maybe
[8324.58 --> 8329.22]  Mmm trying to think what we've talked about that's been good
[8330.02 --> 8330.42]  Lately
[8332.90 --> 8335.78]  So far flow plane chat just thinks they don't do good things
[8336.66 --> 8337.30]  That's fair
[8337.94 --> 8343.22]  Things are pretty dystopian these concept cars. I don't make the rules. I don't know if that I would consider that a good thing
[8343.46 --> 8348.02]  Anyway, this was something that uh, this was something that popped up to me. Um
[8348.82 --> 8352.98]  I do wonder how much coverage is simply paid
[8353.78 --> 8355.78]  Linus I hope this finds you well
[8355.78 --> 8360.90]  I'm writing in regard to my last email in which we discussed featuring you in the top 10 inspiring leaders of 2024
[8361.70 --> 8368.18]  As mentioned previously you will be presented with a two full page profile in the magazine that includes a headshot of the leader
[8368.42 --> 8376.18]  A high resolution pdf of your profile an html link with a backlink a digital logo a media press release and a digital certificate of recognition for the nominal fee of
[8376.18 --> 8378.18]  1500 us dollars
[8379.22 --> 8380.02]  Nice
[8380.02 --> 8384.82]  These come in extremely regularly and I consider them to be
[8385.62 --> 8392.50]  Kind of ridiculous and I didn't know that was for some reason sense, but for some reason I see a lot more coverage
[8393.38 --> 8394.50]  of
[8394.74 --> 8399.78]  Certain people and I see a lot less coverage of me when something's positive
[8401.06 --> 8406.10]  Um, it's just the timing of this this kid this came in, uh, I think about two weeks ago this one
[8406.18 --> 8410.50]  And then there's another one last week that I didn't forward to the um, I think there might be other reasons
[8411.30 --> 8413.22]  I think there are definitely other reasons
[8413.78 --> 8417.38]  But so I don't I don't I don't think that's like a reason to witch hunt someone to be very clear
[8417.54 --> 8420.90]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not that at all
[8420.90 --> 8426.58]  Like okay, there's uh, there's definitely people in the tech space that I know get a lot of real organic coverage
[8426.58 --> 8428.90]  Uh marquez for example gets a ton of organic
[8428.90 --> 8432.90]  Yeah, there's like there's no way marquez is buying any of that. That would be no absolutely
[8432.90 --> 8434.50]  I would be no chance I
[8434.50 --> 8438.34]  I I would eat a tax write-off t-shirt
[8438.34 --> 8443.78]  Yeah, if marquez ever paid to be included in some stupid list. Yeah, so this is this is not about that
[8444.34 --> 8446.34]  my point is just that it
[8447.46 --> 8450.10]  It has stood out to me as a pattern
[8451.38 --> 8457.30]  That when we do something really cool, it almost seems like there's a deafening silence
[8457.78 --> 8458.34]  Yeah
[8458.34 --> 8465.30]  Of discussion about it. Um, I don't know. There's been exceptions seven gamers one cpu actually got a ton of coverage
[8466.90 --> 8468.90]  Yeah, it was a long time ago
[8470.74 --> 8471.54]  Oof
[8471.54 --> 8475.94]  Yeah, I just kind of wonder there's been exceptions it was uh six years ago or however long
[8475.94 --> 8476.90]  Who did I piss off?
[8476.90 --> 8482.10]  Uh, yeah, I don't know. Is the answer everyone? I think part of it's that we're canadian. Here's a weird bit
[8482.98 --> 8488.58]  I was talking to someone recently about like creator events and like creator deals and all this kind of stuff
[8489.14 --> 8490.18]  um
[8490.18 --> 8491.70]  And I mentioned like, you know
[8492.50 --> 8496.66]  I don't hear about a lot of this stuff like i'm obviously not the business department takes care of those things
[8496.66 --> 8499.70]  They've taken care of those things for many years, but I was like a lot of these things
[8500.90 --> 8502.82]  I don't know and he's like, yeah, that's really weird
[8502.82 --> 8506.18]  I'll like i'll like make sure I talk to some people and make sure you guys get bumped more
[8506.18 --> 8509.46]  Then I got a message back a couple days later and he's like, oh
[8511.86 --> 8513.86]  You guys are canadians
[8514.58 --> 8516.58]  It's nothing we can do
[8516.58 --> 8519.30]  Yeah, i'm like, oh, that happens a lot
[8520.98 --> 8525.94]  Okay, so I think just the border makes things annoying so then it's just not really worth it
[8526.66 --> 8528.82]  Yep, honestly, I think that's a lot of it
[8530.98 --> 8534.10]  Yeah, all right like there was the I was in
[8534.10 --> 8535.62]  uh
[8535.62 --> 8537.62]  LA not that long ago and
[8538.74 --> 8544.42]  The same type of thing happened a bajillion people are like hey, let's like do stuff because I can get there easily
[8545.22 --> 8548.26]  They might not be from there, but they can get there really easily
[8548.90 --> 8552.50]  Americans don't have passports. This is another problem that we run into often
[8552.90 --> 8557.38]  Uh, which just like there's a lot of like just not being in the states is like a surprising barrier
[8557.94 --> 8561.14]  Um and one that isn't always often communicated
[8561.86 --> 8563.86]  but exists
[8564.10 --> 8570.18]  Yeah, seven gamers one cpu. It's actually older than I thought it's eight years ago. Yep
[8571.86 --> 8573.30]  Hey
[8573.38 --> 8574.82]  The fcc
[8574.82 --> 8577.30]  raised their definition of broadband
[8577.30 --> 8582.90]  On the very same day that we uploaded that video saying hey, uh, your internet is
[8583.62 --> 8585.30]  probably too fast and
[8586.82 --> 8593.94]  I knew that that title was going to be a little bit baity because I know a lot of people do not have internet that is
[8594.58 --> 8595.78]  uh, too fast
[8595.78 --> 8599.86]  because what I was talking about was how there's a practical limit to
[8599.86 --> 8602.50]  How much benefit you can get?
[8602.50 --> 8605.06]  Oh, no, I agree faster internet. I haven't watched it, but I agree
[8605.54 --> 8609.46]  We basically go through all the reasons you might think you need faster internet
[8609.46 --> 8610.58]  Yeah, and
[8610.58 --> 8613.22]  If you don't have a top-of-the-line gaming pc
[8613.78 --> 8619.22]  And your reason is that you want to download games faster. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. There's basically
[8619.86 --> 8623.06]  There's there's not much check your system resources to crack
[8623.06 --> 8630.66]  To crack gigabit to get higher than gigabit you basically need a very modern high performance gaming pc
[8631.46 --> 8632.66]  um to
[8632.66 --> 8638.34]  Crack two and a half gig like because there are home internet connections that are two and a half gig or even greater
[8638.98 --> 8644.18]  But to to reach download speeds that high on anything that needs to be unpacked as you're downloading it
[8644.50 --> 8646.74]  You need like a thread ripper essentially
[8647.22 --> 8647.62]  um
[8647.62 --> 8655.06]  And so we go through a lot of the considerations like how much of your regular surfing is actually going to be a dns lookup or
[8655.06 --> 8656.10]  uh
[8656.10 --> 8657.14]  loading in
[8657.14 --> 8662.58]  Additional trackers and other content on the page versus what is actually raw download speed we talk about how
[8663.14 --> 8665.46]  Those sites even offer that download speed spool
[8666.26 --> 8670.90]  Right. Yeah, most pages are so small. You're not going to get anywhere near
[8670.90 --> 8672.26]  It's not gonna yeah
[8672.26 --> 8677.06]  This like greater than gigabit speed when you're browsing the web. It's just not going to happen won't ramp up in time
[8677.46 --> 8685.22]  We discuss some of the benefits like faster chunk loading if you're watching netflix or youtube or floatplane.com or whatever the case may be
[8685.62 --> 8694.58]  um, but we also kind of we also discuss we also kind of debunk some of the big reasons that some people pay for mondo home internet and those are
[8694.90 --> 8697.14]  uh, you know self hosting or
[8698.58 --> 8702.50]  Linux iso sharing we're kind of like look and why don't you just
[8703.06 --> 8705.14]  um use a seed bond get it yeah
[8705.14 --> 8711.06]  Yeah, they're so cheap both of those things honestly unless you're doing it for like home lab
[8711.86 --> 8712.74]  um
[8712.98 --> 8715.38]  I want to learn about it stuff reasons
[8716.34 --> 8716.82]  uh
[8716.82 --> 8721.06]  Subakashi says just think of a family of five with everyone using it at the same time
[8721.86 --> 8723.46]  Okay, i'm thinking about it. Yeah
[8724.42 --> 8725.54]  What are the odds?
[8725.54 --> 8728.50]  What are the odds that everyone is?
[8729.14 --> 8735.70]  Doing something at exactly the same time doing something heavy and doing something heavy even if you're all watching?
[8735.70 --> 8740.42]  See this is something a lot of people don't realize even if you're all watching 4k netflix will be enough
[8740.58 --> 8742.42]  you're all pulling down chunks. Yeah
[8743.30 --> 8745.30]  so you
[8745.30 --> 8748.90]  The connection is still gonna sit idle a lot of the time now
[8748.90 --> 8752.02]  There are types of content streaming that are less optimized
[8752.74 --> 8757.62]  And so we kind of we kind of touch on things like twitch for example, especially broadcasting twitch
[8758.02 --> 8762.90]  But even then the bit rates are so much lower that as long as you've got a few hundred megabits symmetric
[8763.70 --> 8765.30]  We're kind of we're kind of at
[8765.30 --> 8772.26]  And it's enough point right now where if you have a mondo machine and it's all about you know
[8773.06 --> 8779.70]  Loading the latest game installing the latest game on your system as fast as possible by all means get a more expensive internet connection or or or
[8779.70 --> 8780.58]  whatever sure
[8781.14 --> 8783.14]  but beyond that
[8783.14 --> 8785.14]  Until the infrastructure changes
[8786.42 --> 8788.42]  Outside of your home
[8788.58 --> 8790.26]  In the services that you're using
[8790.90 --> 8792.10]  We're basically there
[8792.10 --> 8798.02]  There isn't an insane amount of incentive for that because honestly load times are pretty darn good things are kind of
[8799.62 --> 8805.46]  Fast enough. I mean google stopped even we talked about this a few weeks ago, right where google stopped having cached pages
[8805.46 --> 8807.46]  Because they're just like yeah, I don't know the web's pretty reliable
[8808.74 --> 8809.30]  um
[8809.30 --> 8816.34]  Anyway on that same day the fcc quadrupled the minimum internet speed that's required to label it broadband
[8816.34 --> 8821.22]  Which is a really good thing because what I won't argue with is that for a lot of people
[8821.22 --> 8824.18]  Their internet is not fast enough agreed
[8824.42 --> 8824.66]  um
[8825.70 --> 8833.70]  The agency concluded that the minimum speed and isp must offer to market their services broadband should be increased to a hundred megabit down
[8834.10 --> 8835.22]  20 megabit up
[8835.22 --> 8839.46]  This is the first increase since 2015 when it was set at 25.3
[8840.02 --> 8840.58]  um
[8840.58 --> 8842.82]  I actually think that's pretty reasonable
[8843.62 --> 8847.78]  I think a hundred down being broadband is pretty reasonable and luke
[8848.42 --> 8849.86]  remember you're a content creator
[8849.86 --> 8853.62]  Upload actually doesn't matter to most people
[8854.74 --> 8862.50]  Yeah, no, I totally agree. I care about it. I care about it a lot. Yep, like a lot most people are basically never going to use it though
[8862.50 --> 8864.50]  So with that in mind
[8866.02 --> 8866.50]  It's
[8866.50 --> 8874.02]  I wouldn't describe it as the greatest broadband and it doesn't even meet the threshold for what
[8874.58 --> 8880.98]  In our video we said would be kind of the most you'd need it's not it's not there yet. I would still I do think
[8881.54 --> 8887.62]  More people than in the past are heavily using upload now though more work from home is happening. That's totally true
[8887.62 --> 8892.58]  More school from home is happening and you might not necessarily foresee school from home because the whole
[8893.62 --> 8899.54]  RIP and peace forever, but uh snow days are now being like remote school days. That's a
[8900.10 --> 8902.10]  That's a bummer. Um, right
[8903.30 --> 8908.50]  That's okay. This is cool. Hold on. Hold on. I've got a tax write-off update and I've got uh
[8908.50 --> 8912.82]  An update from jake on his ai video sorting thing. Oh nice. Okay, hold on hold on
[8912.82 --> 8914.98]  So i'm just gonna run over to luke's camera for a sec. Yeah
[8915.94 --> 8918.10]  Okay, so let's oh, do you want to switch it to your camera?
[8919.22 --> 8923.70]  Dan got it. You can focus on the merch messages down. He needed a break. I understand
[8926.98 --> 8928.98]  I can multitask
[8930.02 --> 8932.42]  No, no someone can
[8932.42 --> 8935.14]  There are two men working on a computer in a factory
[8935.86 --> 8936.34]  Oh, wow
[8937.54 --> 8939.14]  That's completely ai generated
[8939.78 --> 8943.06]  Horrifying very reasonable to think that's a factory
[8945.14 --> 8946.42]  Sup, sub stream
[8948.66 --> 8949.22]  There is a man
[8949.22 --> 8950.10]  What's going on?
[8950.10 --> 8951.86]  There is a man with a beard and a hat
[8953.46 --> 8956.34]  I mean, yeah, that's true. There's two of them actually
[8956.34 --> 8959.06]  Yeah, you better read it for the people because my mic is really good
[8959.06 --> 8959.30]  Oh
[8960.02 --> 8965.46]  Well, now you're done. It doesn't matter. The point is uh, it said there are two men in a factory working on a computer
[8965.46 --> 8970.02]  And there's a man. What is even happening? Yep. Sorry. Drop the ball on that one. There's a man with a beard and a hat
[8970.58 --> 8972.58]  smiling
[8972.74 --> 8979.38]  That's ai generated and that's just chugging through our footage right now. That's pretty good. Are you wearing a hat in that or a beanie?
[8979.38 --> 8981.38]  I can't really see. I'm wearing a hat
[8981.38 --> 8981.86]  Yeah, all right
[8981.86 --> 8986.82]  So it's creating metadata like that that will allow us to search through our footage
[8986.82 --> 8989.94]  So, uh, jake sent me that and then nick said
[8991.14 --> 8996.42]  I'm adding tracksuits to lol need a couple more minutes. Hold hold on. Okay, psycho
[8996.82 --> 9001.38]  Go for it when you want to this this if these are still available when I get home, I'm buying more
[9001.86 --> 9006.26]  Oh, the dropout or the dropouts. I have a full red dropout. Yeah, I love it
[9006.58 --> 9011.54]  It's it's probably my favorite hoodie at this price. I would just buy another set of
[9012.74 --> 9014.10]  long excel blacks
[9014.90 --> 9017.14]  Yep, you peep peep peep peep
[9018.02 --> 9021.14]  Uh, do you want to go to the uh, do you want to go to the tax write-off?
[9022.26 --> 9027.94]  Uh banner so we'll have we have everything that is a part of the tax write-off event as well
[9028.82 --> 9033.78]  How much of the tracksuits the hoodie this way this is not just red by the way the dropout stuff
[9034.34 --> 9037.38]  Um, the tracksuits 20 bucks. Holy bananas
[9037.94 --> 9041.78]  The jacket jacket's 20 bucks and then the pants the jogger 1999
[9042.82 --> 9043.86]  20 bucks. Okay
[9045.78 --> 9050.26]  Crazy okay, this is actually getting a little bit scary for me. I wasn't sure he was going to add this much stuff
[9050.26 --> 9055.62]  We need to add more at this point. No, we don't actually we're suggesting backpack for 25 bucks. I don't think we're gonna add
[9055.94 --> 9060.74]  Um anything else at this point not a bad idea if you want to write more stuff off. Um
[9060.74 --> 9065.54]  Pretty good. Okay, we added quite a lot to it at this point
[9066.10 --> 9069.22]  I think that we've added enough the dropout is absolutely
[9070.18 --> 9076.10]  Absolute madness at that price. I know what our costs are on this. Yeah, so both both colors are on sale
[9076.98 --> 9078.50]  um of this
[9078.50 --> 9080.98]  I'm not sure why it shows. Um
[9081.62 --> 9087.62]  The thingy here. Okay, I don't I don't know the point is that um
[9087.62 --> 9089.22]  Um, yeah
[9090.34 --> 9091.30]  Uh, okay
[9092.10 --> 9095.14]  Like these are these are products that have rave reviews
[9096.82 --> 9098.82]  This is the this is the track jacket
[9102.50 --> 9104.50]  Amazing quality great for the gym
[9106.02 --> 9107.14]  Mohammed
[9107.14 --> 9110.82]  Okay, sure. I mean whatever best track jacket i've ever owned
[9111.62 --> 9115.06]  Um, the dropout is the dropouts awesome. This is
[9115.06 --> 9119.94]  Hmm. I hesitate to say my favorite hoodie we've ever made. It's fantastic
[9119.94 --> 9124.66]  It's it's the if you if you're on like a saturday off work and you want to just chill
[9125.14 --> 9127.14]  It's the best
[9127.22 --> 9128.34]  It's the best
[9128.34 --> 9132.98]  It might not be the best overall. I don't know, but it's the best for like that. He's got one on
[9132.98 --> 9135.62]  I mean, it's the one i'm rocking today. I like traveling with it a lot
[9136.74 --> 9138.74]  um
[9138.98 --> 9143.78]  It's good stuff. I hope we reserved a few for after the tax write-off event because potato sack
[9143.78 --> 9149.14]  When are we know when is the new potato sack stuff? I have no idea. Okay. Yeah, we have samples
[9149.14 --> 9150.90]  But I I have no idea when it's coming
[9151.54 --> 9154.42]  I feel like you probably should have waited for the potato pc video for
[9155.38 --> 9161.14]  That to launch um, I think I well, I mean sure yeah, because you like announced it in that video. I know
[9161.94 --> 9163.62]  Okay, do I seem like I know what I'm doing?
[9164.74 --> 9168.02]  I told I told him this earlier today. I was like the youtuber
[9168.02 --> 9172.98]  I was like google google a picture of me. This was pretty funny. I was like google a picture of me
[9174.02 --> 9176.02]  and then uh
[9176.02 --> 9180.42]  Images does that guy look like he knows what he's doing? I mean look at this guy
[9182.82 --> 9184.98]  You can't even figure out his facial hair yeah
[9185.78 --> 9189.06]  That one doesn't I mean does this guy look like he knows what he's doing
[9189.06 --> 9199.30]  What is that what is that famous birthdays photo what is up with your hair? Where is it? Up one
[9200.18 --> 9206.82]  What's going on? You've just got the one little twixt my hair naturally little twixt my hair naturally faux hawks dude
[9207.14 --> 9209.46]  Like here look I you can you could probably see here
[9209.46 --> 9211.78]  It's just one here. You can probably see it right now
[9212.18 --> 9215.30]  Like it you know, I know it's always had the little thing it does this thing
[9215.30 --> 9219.78]  It's from both sides like it just kind of like it kind of swoops. I don't get it dude
[9219.78 --> 9220.90]  I should pull it one wancho
[9220.90 --> 9224.66]  I should pull out the old high school photos of when I had carving in my hair
[9225.78 --> 9229.78]  Carving I had yeah, I had like a star on the back of my head and like all this other
[9230.10 --> 9232.42]  I went to this barber shop in victoria brother
[9233.38 --> 9237.14]  And he was like what do you want done? And I was like, I don't know whatever and he's like that's like
[9237.46 --> 9240.10]  That's a dangerous thing to like say here. We do a lot of crazy stuff
[9240.10 --> 9243.86]  And I was like, yeah, I don't care just whatever you want to do and I came out with
[9243.86 --> 9245.86]  Some weird stuff
[9249.06 --> 9251.06]  It was bad never went back to it
[9252.02 --> 9254.50]  That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god
[9257.22 --> 9262.66]  The unit count what goes up yeah, I mean I tried to stop you from doing this
[9263.46 --> 9266.34]  I take zero responsibility the revenue
[9267.62 --> 9269.62]  Doesn't go up go up no go up
[9270.34 --> 9274.82]  But somehow the profit go down. Sorry. I just i'm glued to this report now
[9275.54 --> 9278.34]  By cable management arches to go with it
[9278.34 --> 9284.02]  So weird when you like sell t-shirts for ten dollars that your profit would go down and you sell hoodies like
[9284.50 --> 9289.54]  Thick high quality hoodies for like what is it 20 bucks or something? I don't remember we better not
[9289.54 --> 9293.22]  Move through all the dropout hoodies because that's an amazing hoodie
[9294.50 --> 9296.02]  25 dollars crazy
[9296.58 --> 9298.58]  Jebus
[9299.94 --> 9302.82]  So the cheaper than most places will sell a t-shirt
[9303.86 --> 9310.02]  We're selling a hoodie. That's cool. That's good. We're writing it off. That's really good. Yeah, we're not selling it
[9310.02 --> 9311.78]  We're writing it off you do
[9311.78 --> 9315.38]  Can you not do both? I guess so. Yeah, okay
[9316.02 --> 9321.70]  I'm actually getting a little bit of anxiety now. I was kind of having fun earlier in the show and i've come down a bit welcome
[9324.18 --> 9327.62]  Cool, so I guess it's time for the after party ups the yeah
[9328.02 --> 9332.42]  Yeah, the amd ups the hurts um basically to have a free sink or free sink premium label on your product
[9332.42 --> 9336.02]  You have to support higher refresh rates for gaming. It's good. Yeah
[9336.02 --> 9342.58]  Okay, after please subscribe to float plane. Yeah, yeah, the ludwig video is great
[9344.58 --> 9350.26]  Yep, now's a good time to subscribe to float plane. I'd appreciate that. What's that dan?
[9351.30 --> 9353.30]  Okay, cool
[9355.06 --> 9357.70]  Do I have any comfort food I do oh excellent
[9357.70 --> 9365.22]  Okay
[9372.58 --> 9377.14]  All right the creator are you ready you got to answer some stuff uh-huh yep
[9378.42 --> 9384.34]  I'm gonna try to go through I don't think I can read them to you because I still have 265 to go
[9384.34 --> 9386.34]  Yeah, I can do that you keep chugging
[9387.06 --> 9390.10]  Let me see if I can even get through incoming. Oh, right. I can just minimize it
[9391.22 --> 9393.38]  You just pop it down. It's very usable. Yeah
[9394.42 --> 9396.42]  All right
[9397.94 --> 9408.98]  Howdy the wan show dot dll i'm starting a music hardware company and i'm curious with your products has there been anything good or bad that customers focused on that you didn't expect them to
[9409.62 --> 9411.62]  thank
[9412.50 --> 9412.74]  Huh
[9418.74 --> 9421.62]  Something they focused on that we didn't expect I feel like um
[9422.82 --> 9425.14]  Like i'm the the sort of
[9426.74 --> 9431.78]  Anal retentive person who who is gonna flip out if something's
[9432.50 --> 9439.46]  Even remotely wrong. Is there like a reason why they liked a product that you didn't necessarily foresee being a popular reason or something like that
[9439.46 --> 9444.58]  Like focused on doesn't necessarily mean negative. No, no, no, I get it. I get it
[9445.14 --> 9447.14]  um
[9448.82 --> 9454.26]  Man, uh, this is this is really hard i'm loading up the store and i'm going to
[9454.98 --> 9461.54]  Look at our products. Oh, okay. Here's something. I didn't think people would care so much about our screwdriver bits being black
[9461.54 --> 9465.46]  That black coating is actually functional
[9466.18 --> 9466.58]  um
[9466.58 --> 9471.46]  And it has something to do with something something the metal better or something
[9471.86 --> 9474.42]  Uh, but it's cosmetic after that fact
[9474.42 --> 9481.86]  Um, so we've had people try to initiate return requests because the black coating has come off of their bits
[9482.74 --> 9483.22]  um
[9484.34 --> 9486.34]  That was something
[9486.34 --> 9491.46]  That was weird not something I expected people to focus on yeah
[9492.50 --> 9492.82]  Uh
[9492.82 --> 9493.94]  Fair enough
[9493.94 --> 9497.38]  There I came up with something good job linus. Yeah, uh, hey linus
[9497.38 --> 9502.90]  I actually work at a badminton facility or I should broadcast this uh, I collect shuttles at the end of the
[9503.86 --> 9508.98]  That didn't work. Uh-oh. That's okay. Just read it. Uh, I collect shuttles at the end of the day
[9509.06 --> 9516.18]  My question is why don't we ever see shuttles that behave like feather ones, but are nearly indestructible?
[9516.34 --> 9518.10]  Ah, so they're working on that
[9519.22 --> 9522.26]  Um, I've actually tried a couple of them
[9523.62 --> 9526.02]  Here's uh victor's carbon sonic
[9526.34 --> 9532.10]  So these are synthetic feather shuttles, uh, the ones that i've used i don't think they were this one
[9532.10 --> 9534.10]  I think they were a different one, but very similar
[9534.26 --> 9536.58]  They use almost a foam-like material here
[9537.06 --> 9542.18]  And they do last substantially longer than feather shuttles and don't have some of the same
[9543.30 --> 9545.78]  Animal cruelty concerns as feather shuttles
[9546.50 --> 9552.34]  But I think it's going to be quite a while before we see any kind of professional tournament move to something like this because
[9553.62 --> 9558.58]  While they have a benefit in terms of cost they do not fly quite the same
[9559.38 --> 9560.58]  it's
[9560.66 --> 9565.54]  Nature is one heck of a good designer and as it turns out
[9566.50 --> 9568.02]  Synthetically
[9568.02 --> 9576.90]  Or mimicking the properties of a natural material with a synthetic one is extremely extremely difficult and
[9579.94 --> 9581.94]  I mean it's
[9582.10 --> 9588.34]  Has like yeah, I don't think the like will the nba ever move beyond leather balls like why I don't think so
[9588.34 --> 9593.86]  Like I guess it's the same that 3d printed basketball recently, which was
[9594.98 --> 9596.90]  Pretty cool actually pretty cool
[9597.78 --> 9598.90]  But unless it is
[9599.46 --> 9604.50]  Actually identical. I just don't see it happening. It's the same with baseballs. They're going to be leather
[9605.22 --> 9606.26]  Forever
[9606.26 --> 9611.46]  Because at that level they can afford the real one and so you might see in fact
[9611.46 --> 9616.10]  You do see like you play like a minor b game or whatever you're going to be playing with like a hunk of plastic
[9616.74 --> 9620.42]  Because it doesn't matter. They're just going to huck it in a pitching machine. It's going to get chewed up anyway
[9620.90 --> 9621.70]  but
[9621.70 --> 9622.90]  at an elite level
[9624.02 --> 9628.74]  I think natural materials are going to be king for the foreseeable future and
[9630.02 --> 9636.02]  When it comes to marketing you always market what the pros use so there's always going to be that that aspiration
[9636.58 --> 9639.70]  To to use the natural material that the like the real one
[9640.58 --> 9646.82]  Natural materials always going to be real no matter how fraught it is with you know ethical concerns. Yeah. Yeah
[9646.82 --> 9648.82]  I
[9649.94 --> 9651.94]  This one is curated technically
[9654.26 --> 9660.90]  I don't think it did work first time i've remembered to add a merch message and i'm wasting it on this meta joke about wasting a merch message
[9661.14 --> 9663.78]  Love you dan nice nice nice
[9664.66 --> 9666.18]  That got curated it did
[9666.98 --> 9675.70]  Nice good job, dan. I suspect that was a misclick. Hello, wan dll luke. I'm relatively i'm a relatively new it director of a booming it team
[9676.26 --> 9682.82]  What criteria do you use to give junior admins or engineers admin passwords or the keys to the kingdom for critical infra?
[9683.54 --> 9685.54]  Generally, it's are you aj?
[9686.98 --> 9689.78]  Um if the answer is no low chart then
[9690.66 --> 9693.86]  Then no if the answer is yes, then yeah
[9694.26 --> 9694.90]  um
[9694.90 --> 9697.86]  So aj's been with us over five years now, um
[9699.22 --> 9702.82]  Seven years shut up pretty sure seven pretty sure
[9702.82 --> 9705.22]  He's he technically
[9705.86 --> 9711.78]  Started helping me with things that's right in a non-professional capacity in 2016
[9712.42 --> 9715.38]  Good lord, uh, that was super light
[9715.38 --> 9716.42]  Okay, um
[9717.46 --> 9719.46]  By the time we're in 2017
[9720.26 --> 9725.30]  Things are ramping up. He's still technically non-professional capacity at the beginning of the year by the end of the year
[9725.30 --> 9726.58]  He's working with us full-time
[9726.58 --> 9727.62]  Um
[9731.14 --> 9732.18]  Yeah, um
[9733.14 --> 9736.82]  I don't know it's different. It's very difficult though. It's actually really hard. Um
[9738.18 --> 9743.22]  You need to not one thing that you need to communicate to your team that I think is actually really important to communicate
[9743.62 --> 9745.14]  is that it's not a
[9746.02 --> 9747.14]  sign of respect
[9748.26 --> 9749.30]  It's
[9750.18 --> 9755.86]  It's no seriously though. It's it's no I was just I was looking at our um sales report. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[9756.18 --> 9759.46]  Um having the keys is a threat
[9761.30 --> 9766.58]  For everyone it's not a good thing you don't want too many people to have access to stuff
[9766.58 --> 9770.66]  You want generally at least two admins on every system just in case
[9771.14 --> 9774.58]  Something goes wrong with one of the admin accounts. You can still recover it or whatever
[9774.90 --> 9780.02]  Um, but other than that you really want to limit it as much as possible and what you might end up wanting to do
[9780.02 --> 9784.98]  Uh, because it sounds like your team might be fairly sizable is to have some like
[9785.70 --> 9789.70]  areas of ownership so you have a person who has the keys to a certain like
[9790.50 --> 9792.74]  portion of the it department
[9793.14 --> 9794.98]  um, but they don't have it for all of it
[9794.98 --> 9798.90]  And then a different person has it for another portion and then you have it for all of them or something like that
[9798.90 --> 9803.62]  But there shouldn't be very many people that have it for all of them ideally just kind of one and then
[9803.62 --> 9805.62]  uh, some people that have
[9806.50 --> 9809.46]  smaller amounts it's it's an accountability
[9814.42 --> 9816.42]  It's a risk vector
[9816.74 --> 9819.54]  Because every account has a potential to be compromised
[9819.54 --> 9823.94]  So even if like every single person at LTT was perfectly trustworthy, which i'm sure they are
[9823.94 --> 9830.66]  Um, if we gave every single person full admin rights to every single thing then every single person's account
[9831.30 --> 9837.30]  Is now a major insanely scary attack vector to owning everything that we have
[9837.78 --> 9839.78]  Um, so you just you don't want to do that
[9840.82 --> 9845.94]  So you it's like I have people on my team that are like happy when they lose permissions to things
[9846.50 --> 9851.14]  Because they're like oh, I don't have to like worry about this thing so much anymore, which is good
[9851.62 --> 9853.62]  um
[9854.02 --> 9856.02]  Yeah, I don't know so
[9856.18 --> 9856.90]  It's scary
[9857.70 --> 9861.46]  Try to try to slowly creep your trust with people
[9861.86 --> 9863.54]  Um, like increase it slowly
[9864.02 --> 9864.50]  Um
[9867.94 --> 9868.18]  Yeah
[9870.18 --> 9876.02]  Fun fact one of the reasons why when I was at school I was seriously thinking about becoming a database administrator was because I was like
[9876.02 --> 9879.62]  Hey, if i'm in control of all your data, you're probably gonna pay me pretty well
[9879.62 --> 9883.22]  That was the theory
[9883.22 --> 9889.54]  Yeah, it's like I don't know like I I when you have access to extremely important things
[9890.50 --> 9895.78]  And all that type of stuff it comes with you are a a portion of risk and
[9896.42 --> 9898.66]  You know that person's probably gonna be taken care of decently. Well
[9898.66 --> 9903.78]  That was a thought process. Um, I ran out of curated's
[9904.98 --> 9905.38]  Already
[9906.18 --> 9906.58]  uh
[9907.62 --> 9911.30]  I don't know if that's because oh, nope. Okay. They're loading
[9912.10 --> 9913.78]  Did you just do that? Yeah, okay
[9919.78 --> 9922.50]  I was looking at that one going like the is this
[9922.50 --> 9927.78]  Uh, hi guys linus are you open to criticism now?
[9929.78 --> 9935.46]  Would you be willing to have it off now discussion slash interview with someone who didn't like you before august
[9936.02 --> 9937.06]  Turn it off now
[9937.62 --> 9944.50]  Now are and now are giving you a second chance to see if it's better second chance to what the fuck are you talking about?
[9944.50 --> 9948.34]  Like am I open to criticism? I'm here
[9950.42 --> 9956.90]  Give it to me. I don't understand why you would do that, uh, because I almost don't understand why you do almost any interview
[9957.38 --> 9958.50]  um
[9958.50 --> 9965.30]  I don't do many no very few people ask me. Yeah, um, maybe you end up doing like a call in and sumir video someday
[9965.78 --> 9972.18]  I don't know. I kind of doubt it, but I kind of we're not really mainstream. Yeah, we're the we're like we're a big fish
[9972.18 --> 9975.14]  In a really small pond
[9976.18 --> 9982.02]  Like actually very small. I think a lot of people massively overestimate how big the space is and and the thing is like
[9982.58 --> 9989.86]  Yeah, we're we're we're big on youtube, but that's also a small pond like on youtube companies like dude perfect are big
[9990.18 --> 9994.98]  And you know what those guys are killing it. Oh, yeah, they're crushing it. They're doing awesome. Yeah
[9995.78 --> 9999.06]  for like, you know a group of entrepreneurs
[9999.70 --> 10001.70]  not they're not running
[10002.02 --> 10004.90]  You know a multinational business in the same way that
[10005.86 --> 10011.06]  Really big businesses are operating. It's just not it's just not on the same scale right and um
[10011.70 --> 10018.34]  I'll sometimes I find you know, I we talked a long time ago. You mentioned the 100 million dollar offer thing
[10018.90 --> 10023.14]  um, and then i'll see some company that like I think is small
[10024.42 --> 10026.18]  And it's like oh they just sold for
[10027.22 --> 10029.22]  980 million dollars
[10029.22 --> 10031.22]  I'm like
[10032.66 --> 10033.54]  Or people are like wow
[10033.54 --> 10038.10]  I can't believe they were able to acquire this chumpany for company for so cheap. It was only company chumpany
[10038.18 --> 10041.70]  Yeah, yeah, perfect. Who were you talking about that Freudian slip though?
[10041.70 --> 10046.90]  I can't believe they were able to get them so cheap for only 2.7 billion dollars, and i'm like oh
[10048.50 --> 10049.14]  Oh
[10049.14 --> 10050.74]  People are out there doing stuff
[10050.74 --> 10051.30]  um
[10051.30 --> 10052.50]  Corey is the name
[10052.50 --> 10053.46]  Corey is the name
[10053.46 --> 10058.26]  Corey is the name has a great response to this tell the kind man. Thank you for giving you a second chance
[10059.94 --> 10063.70]  I appreciate it. I do actually thanks. I do I do actually
[10064.02 --> 10066.42]  um as for as for being open to criticism
[10066.42 --> 10075.30]  My word um, I have been criticized from the moment I first uploaded a video and people talked about my
[10075.38 --> 10080.58]  My earrings or you know, whatever else or my awful high-pitched voice
[10081.06 --> 10084.66]  um to the moment that you are sitting in right now
[10085.06 --> 10086.82]  uh telling me you didn't like me
[10087.54 --> 10092.18]  Prior to august and now you have to have an interview with them. But you're willing to consider
[10092.18 --> 10097.54]  If you can like me now, will you now spend your time doing this? Um
[10098.66 --> 10105.54]  Hey, I I I do appreciate it though. Um, the the the cold hard truth. Appreciate the second chance. Yeah, I do
[10105.54 --> 10112.26]  I do appreciate that and um, you know, if you if if you're chill, then i'm chill and if you're not
[10112.26 --> 10114.26]  Then that's you know what that's okay, too
[10114.26 --> 10115.62]  Because at the end of the day
[10116.58 --> 10118.58]  I just got to do my thing here
[10118.58 --> 10119.46]  um
[10119.46 --> 10120.98]  That that's what youtube is
[10122.18 --> 10123.54]  It's
[10123.62 --> 10131.22]  From your perspective you but but it's me right and uh, for a lot of people that's going to resonate and for a lot of people that's
[10132.18 --> 10136.02]  Not going to resonate and um, you know, we're just going to be us
[10137.86 --> 10139.86]  We'll be here
[10139.86 --> 10144.98]  If you're uh, if it's third chance time another time because you didn't like my response to that then hey, I feel like that might happen
[10145.54 --> 10147.14]  I'm still gonna be here for that too though
[10148.50 --> 10150.50]  I'll be here
[10150.50 --> 10152.50]  Yeah, all right. Yeah
[10154.26 --> 10156.02]  Sorry, I just saw that one. I was like all right, carry
[10157.62 --> 10162.66]  Um, I got one uh, let's do it congrats on the mcm launch question for
[10165.14 --> 10166.42]  Little l
[10166.42 --> 10172.50]  Uh, what was the hardest part about selecting the components of each pack of the mcm? All right, go ahead and ask him
[10172.50 --> 10174.50]  Uh
[10180.10 --> 10183.94]  Basically, we were we were trying to make sure that um
[10184.02 --> 10190.90]  We had a pretty safe balance of what most people would need for kind of the the targeted the stated use for them
[10190.90 --> 10194.18]  So what we did was uh, we went around to people's desks
[10194.18 --> 10199.62]  We asked people about their home setups here at the office because we're pretty representative of gamers and techies and
[10200.50 --> 10201.86]  We kind of
[10201.86 --> 10207.22]  Did it and they're like, okay, how much did we need without overspending and then we built bundles based on that?
[10208.82 --> 10210.26]  Oh, that makes some sense
[10210.26 --> 10212.66]  I got a question about my setup a while ago
[10213.46 --> 10216.82]  And I didn't bother ask like why they were asking these questions, but I was like what
[10218.02 --> 10219.86]  And I think it was probably related to that
[10220.26 --> 10227.30]  Um next question, uh, i'm 37. Oh, I should broadcast i'm 37 and had both hips replaced last month
[10227.30 --> 10230.98]  If you could replace any part of your body with titanium
[10232.10 --> 10234.10]  What would it be my head?
[10238.18 --> 10238.90]  That's pretty good
[10240.02 --> 10241.86]  Yeah, because you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference
[10242.42 --> 10243.46]  Got him
[10246.42 --> 10247.86]  If it worked just as well
[10248.90 --> 10250.74]  But was less susceptible to damage
[10251.86 --> 10253.14]  I think my spine
[10254.66 --> 10255.94]  That'd be pretty sick
[10255.94 --> 10256.74]  But that's like
[10257.30 --> 10260.18]  That's just like a worst case scenario insurance policy
[10260.18 --> 10262.18]  Whereas if you went with like the knees
[10262.18 --> 10264.66]  Yeah, then you'd know it's definitely useful
[10264.66 --> 10265.62]  It's pretty or hips
[10265.62 --> 10267.22]  Yeah, hips are huge dude
[10267.22 --> 10267.78]  They don't lie
[10267.78 --> 10268.26]  Break your
[10269.38 --> 10270.66]  The the fatality
[10271.38 --> 10273.86]  Percentage after breaking your hip is insane
[10273.86 --> 10274.50]  That's true
[10274.50 --> 10276.26]  Like it's actually crazy
[10276.98 --> 10277.86]  How are we doing boys?
[10278.42 --> 10279.54]  Uh, we ran out of curate
[10279.54 --> 10280.66]  It's never better Dan
[10280.66 --> 10282.42]  I just uh, I just gave up and left
[10282.90 --> 10283.94]  Yeah, I saw that
[10283.94 --> 10284.66]  Noticed
[10284.66 --> 10286.82]  Well, no, he was probably going to work on the after party
[10287.14 --> 10288.18]  No, I was just crying
[10288.18 --> 10289.30]  I was just crying outside
[10289.30 --> 10289.54]  Oh
[10289.54 --> 10290.74]  I was gonna say I think he just took a break
[10290.74 --> 10292.18]  Oh, okay, well that's fine too
[10293.86 --> 10295.54]  Because he didn't go that way
[10295.54 --> 10296.50]  You went this way
[10296.50 --> 10300.58]  Yeah, there's a quiet server room where nobody can hear you sad
[10301.06 --> 10301.46]  Um
[10301.46 --> 10302.18]  You mean scream?
[10303.30 --> 10303.46]  Sure
[10304.02 --> 10304.90]  I have no mouth
[10305.30 --> 10305.62]  Um
[10305.62 --> 10308.66]  Did you want two cameras or one camera?
[10309.22 --> 10309.70]  Um
[10309.70 --> 10311.62]  Same as last week or more advanced?
[10311.62 --> 10314.26]  Dan, why don't you tell us what you have the strength for?
[10317.14 --> 10319.22]  I can jump as high as you want, Linus
[10319.22 --> 10322.26]  No matter what hour of the day or how long my shift has been
[10322.26 --> 10324.10]  How easy is the second camera?
[10324.82 --> 10326.18]  What about second camera?
[10326.18 --> 10327.94]  What about second camera?
[10327.94 --> 10332.10]  I'm starting these Linusisms and it's becoming a bit of a problem
[10332.42 --> 10332.74]  Yeah
[10332.74 --> 10332.82]  Um
[10334.50 --> 10334.90]  After
[10335.86 --> 10338.02]  Last week it's it's trivial now so
[10338.02 --> 10338.34]  Okay
[10338.34 --> 10338.90]  Um
[10339.46 --> 10342.58]  How long are you gonna be to get through these 362 merch messages?
[10342.58 --> 10344.02]  We're not gonna get through them all today
[10344.02 --> 10344.34]  Okay
[10344.34 --> 10349.46]  Yeah, we're just gonna we're gonna do some of them and then we'll we'll go up and we'll do super checks and then we'll call it there
[10349.46 --> 10355.78]  because um you don't know this but um I have to be at the airport in like six hours or something like that so
[10356.18 --> 10356.74]  Okay
[10356.74 --> 10357.30]  Oh
[10357.54 --> 10360.74]  I also am incentivized to not be here forever
[10360.74 --> 10362.10]  Let's do one camera
[10362.10 --> 10363.14]  It could be two
[10363.14 --> 10363.78]  One camera
[10363.78 --> 10364.58]  It could be two
[10364.58 --> 10365.94]  I'm doing two cameras
[10365.94 --> 10366.50]  It's better
[10366.50 --> 10367.06]  It looks better
[10367.06 --> 10368.10]  How many games do you want to do?
[10368.10 --> 10368.90]  It looks better
[10368.90 --> 10370.90]  It's got to be best of seven or it's barely even hockey
[10370.90 --> 10371.94]  Oh my god
[10371.94 --> 10373.78]  I think best of five is the way
[10373.78 --> 10376.34]  I think best of five is the way if you're a coward
[10376.90 --> 10377.30]  Wow
[10377.30 --> 10377.94]  Are you a coward?
[10377.94 --> 10378.58]  What does that even mean?
[10378.58 --> 10379.54]  Are you a yellow belly?
[10379.54 --> 10380.66]  Why would that be more coward?
[10380.66 --> 10383.94]  Luke has a skill issue and he doesn't want anybody to know it
[10385.22 --> 10387.46]  I tell everyone I lose most of the
[10387.46 --> 10388.98]  F***ing got him
[10388.98 --> 10391.46]  I will wreck both of you
[10391.46 --> 10393.22]  Let's play a different game
[10394.58 --> 10396.34]  Yeah, because you can't win at super checks
[10396.34 --> 10396.82]  That's true
[10398.10 --> 10399.62]  He's spicy tonight
[10399.62 --> 10400.02]  I like him
[10400.02 --> 10400.90]  I'm very tired
[10402.34 --> 10403.14]  I will break you
[10405.62 --> 10406.02]  All right
[10406.02 --> 10408.74]  I'm excited for when Dan and I work out again
[10408.74 --> 10408.98]  Yeah
[10410.34 --> 10412.98]  Sounds like we're doing mastery sets for every single one
[10412.98 --> 10413.06]  Hell yeah
[10413.06 --> 10414.18]  Let's go
[10414.18 --> 10415.38]  I almost said a bad word
[10417.06 --> 10418.34]  I'm gonna go get another camera
[10419.22 --> 10421.38]  Unless you guys want to end the stream or something like that
[10421.38 --> 10422.34]  We could do that together
[10422.34 --> 10422.90]  Yeah, we'll
[10422.90 --> 10423.62]  No, right
[10423.62 --> 10424.42]  No, not yet
[10424.42 --> 10424.82]  Okay
[10424.82 --> 10425.62]  Yeah, not yet
[10425.62 --> 10426.42]  We should do a few more
[10426.42 --> 10427.14]  We should do a few more
[10427.14 --> 10427.54]  We got quite a bit more
[10427.54 --> 10428.50]  Give me ten minutes
[10428.50 --> 10428.66]  Yeah
[10429.54 --> 10430.02]  The uh
[10430.66 --> 10432.98]  We're still getting a merch message every ten seconds
[10432.98 --> 10433.46]  Luke
[10433.46 --> 10438.10]  We should do more of these though
[10438.10 --> 10438.74]  Um
[10438.74 --> 10439.78]  Yeah, we'll do a few more
[10439.78 --> 10440.90]  But like oh my gosh
[10440.90 --> 10442.42]  Uh, this is ridiculous
[10442.42 --> 10444.26]  I'll let you chew on this one for a second
[10444.26 --> 10446.34]  Then I'll go try to deal with more of them
[10446.34 --> 10447.38]  Uh, hey DLL
[10447.38 --> 10448.02]  I'm gonna broadcast
[10448.02 --> 10448.74]  Hey DLL
[10448.74 --> 10449.54]  I have a question
[10449.54 --> 10452.74]  Uh, I've had this question for a while for Linus
[10452.74 --> 10453.94]  Between your relationship
[10454.50 --> 10457.70]  Between your wife Yvonne and your husband Luke
[10457.70 --> 10459.06]  Which has had more development?
[10460.34 --> 10461.62]  Oh, um
[10462.82 --> 10464.42]  That's actually a decent question
[10464.42 --> 10468.18]  I mean the one where you have kids together is gonna be the one
[10468.18 --> 10469.06]  That's unquestionably gonna be
[10469.06 --> 10469.22]  Yeah
[10469.22 --> 10472.58]  Where you have the biggest questions to answer
[10472.58 --> 10474.42]  Because at the end of the day
[10474.42 --> 10475.46]  It better be
[10475.46 --> 10477.22]  As much as we
[10477.22 --> 10478.90]  As much as we like to
[10478.90 --> 10482.98]  As much as we
[10482.98 --> 10486.82]  Care deeply about our team here
[10486.82 --> 10489.62]  Um, there's a difference between
[10492.02 --> 10496.42]  The relationship of a group of co-workers
[10496.42 --> 10498.90]  And the relationship of your flesh and blood
[10498.90 --> 10502.34]  Um, and and while we
[10502.34 --> 10503.70]  Um
[10503.70 --> 10510.10]  While we want what's best for the team
[10510.10 --> 10513.30]  And while the team wants what's best for the company
[10513.30 --> 10514.66]  At the end of the day
[10514.66 --> 10517.30]  I believe that money corrupts everything
[10518.18 --> 10522.26]  And I think that because money is inherent
[10522.26 --> 10524.50]  In an employer employee relationship
[10525.22 --> 10526.50]  The capacity
[10526.50 --> 10528.02]  There's still money involved in
[10528.02 --> 10528.98]  Well, I was gonna get to that
[10528.98 --> 10529.30]  Okay
[10529.30 --> 10533.78]  The capacity for it to corrupt the relationship
[10533.78 --> 10535.22]  Is almost guaranteed
[10535.94 --> 10540.42]  Like every work relationship pretty much ends at some point
[10540.42 --> 10541.46]  And there are exceptions
[10542.10 --> 10546.10]  But if you compare that to the capacity of money to corrupt
[10546.10 --> 10548.66]  A family relationship which is great
[10549.30 --> 10550.26]  Which is huge
[10550.82 --> 10551.78]  The percentages
[10551.78 --> 10552.58]  Less guaranteed
[10553.06 --> 10553.62]  Is lower
[10553.62 --> 10553.94]  Yeah
[10553.94 --> 10556.10]  And and let's not kid ourselves money
[10557.22 --> 10558.90]  Destroys many families
[10558.90 --> 10561.46]  Especially I think right now where cost of living is so high
[10561.46 --> 10563.46]  And it's so financially beneficial to
[10564.02 --> 10564.90]  Split the rent
[10565.54 --> 10567.46]  With split the rent of one room
[10567.46 --> 10568.50]  With another person
[10568.50 --> 10571.14]  Yeah, maybe taint is the right word instead of corrupt
[10571.14 --> 10572.42]  Says Mawson on float plane
[10572.42 --> 10573.38]  That's probably right
[10573.94 --> 10577.14]  Um, I think that and you know obviously
[10578.10 --> 10579.86]  Okay, this is a perfect example because
[10580.90 --> 10584.50]  The thing I was about to say comes from a position of
[10585.38 --> 10587.38]  Of a power imbalance in the relationship
[10588.02 --> 10590.58]  I was going to say I don't feel like money has
[10591.14 --> 10594.18]  Corrupted or tainted mine and luke's relationship
[10596.42 --> 10596.98]  Not yet
[10596.98 --> 10598.10]  I feel hasn't yet
[10598.10 --> 10598.26]  I
[10599.22 --> 10600.42]  I feel like it would be pretty tough
[10600.42 --> 10603.94]  But that's easy for me to say in my position
[10603.94 --> 10604.50]  And so
[10605.38 --> 10606.50]  The dynamics always there
[10606.50 --> 10609.78]  It's always something that has to be kind of
[10610.66 --> 10611.62]  Considered
[10611.62 --> 10612.66]  Um, and that I
[10612.66 --> 10614.82]  I have to be aware of and have to be
[10614.82 --> 10616.02]  And I have to be careful of
[10616.02 --> 10616.98]  Um, because
[10616.98 --> 10618.66]  Because that potential
[10619.30 --> 10621.78]  For taint that potential for corruption
[10622.18 --> 10626.26]  Is always there even if it never seeps in if that kind of makes sense
[10626.26 --> 10627.22]  Do you kind of get what I mean?
[10627.22 --> 10628.90]  No, it is. Yeah, it's uh
[10628.90 --> 10632.18]  I often consider things I might say because
[10633.78 --> 10636.50]  Because you might only think of this from linus's perspective
[10636.50 --> 10637.94]  But there's things that I can say
[10639.14 --> 10639.38]  That
[10640.98 --> 10643.14]  Could be very charged as well
[10643.14 --> 10646.18]  Sure, like okay, here's an example that could go
[10646.90 --> 10651.94]  Both ways, you know, if I were to if I were to make a comment like
[10652.58 --> 10655.54]  Okay, let's say I was getting married. This is a big thing right now
[10655.54 --> 10660.42]  Uh, millennials are apparently destroying their relationships over destination weddings. Oh
[10660.42 --> 10663.14]  Um, not their relationships with the spouse
[10663.14 --> 10667.86]  But their relationships with their families over destination weddings and the costs associated with it
[10667.86 --> 10669.94]  If I were to get butt hurt
[10670.66 --> 10676.90]  Over Luke refusing to attend my stupid destination wedding and I were to somehow
[10677.94 --> 10680.82]  Make that about the money that I know he has, right?
[10680.82 --> 10682.98]  Because why do I know that?
[10682.98 --> 10684.98]  I only know how much money Luke has because
[10685.94 --> 10689.14]  He works damn hard for it and at the end of the day I sign the check
[10689.22 --> 10692.26]  But that's not a normal dynamic in a relationship
[10692.26 --> 10695.62]  And in this equal but opposite if I start complaining about expenses
[10696.34 --> 10698.26]  It can put pressure on me
[10698.82 --> 10700.98]  The the the human being the friend
[10701.62 --> 10705.70]  That wouldn't normally be there if he was just a bro complaining about expenses
[10705.70 --> 10708.42]  Which like I I have at times
[10708.42 --> 10714.82]  But but I try to be pretty careful with it and I try to make sure that i'm presenting things the right way
[10714.82 --> 10715.86]  Yeah, and I often
[10716.58 --> 10720.02]  Am paying attention and so and it's always been fine
[10720.02 --> 10725.14]  It's something we both have to worry about a little bit. Yeah, because there's that potential there like
[10726.34 --> 10729.70]  Okay, here's here's another really great example. Okay when it comes to food
[10730.34 --> 10737.38]  Right? It would be very easy for luke to be upset that knowing as he does my
[10738.26 --> 10743.70]  Financial situation as well. It would be easy for him to be upset if I just didn't offer to pay for everything
[10744.26 --> 10750.02]  But then it would be easy for me to be upset if luke didn't offer to pay for things at the very least
[10750.26 --> 10753.30]  Because I might feel taken for granted. I might feel taken advantage of
[10753.94 --> 10755.94]  So these are the kinds of
[10755.94 --> 10759.86]  Dynamics that will always exist but that I feel like we're both
[10760.58 --> 10766.26]  Cognizant of and that we're both respectful about yeah, and that we try to keep out of our relationship
[10766.26 --> 10770.90]  But it's a conscious effort. I guess is what i'm trying to say. Yeah, every relationship whether it's
[10771.78 --> 10778.26]  Romantically involved or not is gonna have some amount of work element to it. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I mean
[10779.46 --> 10781.46]  Relationships are a lot of work. Yeah
[10781.46 --> 10787.30]  And and work is tough on a relationship like it's worth every way to be clear. Yeah, it's worth it
[10787.30 --> 10790.18]  You should try to have like your the amount of friends you have
[10791.22 --> 10799.70]  Is gonna dwindle over time. It really does doesn't it pretty pretty intensely. Um, I think we might have some and I started with like three
[10801.86 --> 10805.62]  I think we might have some somewhat unique, uh things going on there
[10805.94 --> 10806.98]  um
[10806.98 --> 10812.34]  Because I I mean my like core friend group has always been cool and I suspect they will always be cool
[10812.66 --> 10818.18]  But there's some like people that I was more on the acquaintance level with that will reach out randomly and I'm like
[10819.14 --> 10824.18]  Now I am automatically primed and suspicious of like is this because of yeah
[10824.58 --> 10827.78]  Is this because of public presence is this because you need something whatever?
[10827.78 --> 10833.62]  And it almost always is I've those two things i've told yvonne before because she
[10834.34 --> 10837.22]  She and I she and I talk doomsday scenarios. It's a hobby
[10837.78 --> 10842.90]  Um, and and and and she has said things like well, it would be easy for you to find someone
[10843.54 --> 10848.50]  Um, and just not in like an like angry way, but just in like a debating way
[10848.50 --> 10854.58]  We we talk right, you know, you're married long enough. You talk about everything eventually and I kind of went
[10854.58 --> 10858.66]  Well, right, but what would that be?
[10859.78 --> 10860.02]  Yeah
[10860.02 --> 10861.22]  because
[10861.22 --> 10864.18]  It's gonna be charged would I ever
[10865.06 --> 10866.10]  sure you're right
[10866.90 --> 10871.22]  Honestly at at at my at my age and
[10872.34 --> 10872.74]  and
[10873.54 --> 10875.54]  Like being a youtuber which is
[10876.10 --> 10879.22]  from my understanding kind of desirable thing and
[10879.22 --> 10885.06]  You know having a pretty pretty decent amount of money, you know, could I could I find uh
[10885.62 --> 10888.66]  Could I find a meat thing to spend time with?
[10889.38 --> 10892.74]  I I don't I don't really question that you don't need to get all
[10894.02 --> 10896.02]  Yes, if one would do fine, you don't need to
[10896.02 --> 10898.02]  Oh, she would you don't need to
[10898.02 --> 10900.98]  Propose in chat right now. She'd have no trouble banging
[10901.14 --> 10906.18]  I I have no doubt because because the same thing is also true in the inverse, right?
[10906.18 --> 10907.78]  Yeah, she is also
[10907.78 --> 10912.42]  Very eligible, you know as a as a bachelorette
[10912.42 --> 10917.94]  So but but but what I said what I said to her was like, yeah, I have no question that I could find something
[10919.54 --> 10922.42]  But would I ever find that genuine
[10923.06 --> 10923.94]  Trying to seek
[10924.90 --> 10926.90]  The same quality that I previously had
[10927.54 --> 10934.26]  I would never find it and i'm gonna have to find someone that is worth the amount of work and effort that we did to get to where we are
[10934.26 --> 10936.58]  And i'm gonna have to do all of that again
[10937.62 --> 10943.54]  Do you want to have the small conversations again all the way to build up so that you can have the big conversations?
[10943.54 --> 10946.18]  Like is that effort you actually want to go through at this time?
[10946.34 --> 10948.66]  I was talking to you and every time
[10949.38 --> 10951.38]  I would be suspicious
[10951.38 --> 10956.02]  Yeah, like okay, yvonne yvonne and I do not have a prenuptial agreement
[10956.90 --> 10958.02]  Do you know why?
[10958.02 --> 10960.18]  Because there was no money
[10960.90 --> 10966.82]  There were no assets like there i've say i've seen people talk about how like yvonne married him for the money or whatever
[10966.82 --> 10967.14]  I
[10967.14 --> 10967.78]  I
[10967.78 --> 10969.54]  It would have been the other way around at that time
[10969.54 --> 10974.02]  She had a much better outlook than I did when we got together you guys gotta you gotta understand that
[10974.26 --> 10974.98]  Yeah
[10974.98 --> 10976.66]  And I was thinking about it
[10976.66 --> 10982.02]  Could I ever trust another person the way that I trust yvonne like yvonne
[10982.74 --> 10984.74]  Has complete power of attorney?
[10984.90 --> 10988.34]  She has complete control of all of our financial assets
[10988.90 --> 10992.10]  There are so many things that require only her signature
[10992.74 --> 10993.54]  And
[10993.54 --> 10995.14]  Do you know how I sleep at night?
[10995.86 --> 10997.94]  Soundly like a baby
[10999.22 --> 10999.54]  Sorry
[11000.34 --> 11003.86]  That one part happens before the sleep it doesn't matter the point is that
[11005.46 --> 11008.98]  You know what i'd probably be fine with yvonne having those things for me too
[11008.98 --> 11009.62]  she is
[11010.26 --> 11011.70]  extremely
[11011.70 --> 11019.14]  Responsible reasonable person an absolute rock yeah and I was thinking about even if I met yvonne today
[11020.98 --> 11025.06]  Could I trust her the way that I do honestly probably not knowing about the dynamics
[11025.14 --> 11025.70]  Yeah, no
[11025.70 --> 11027.30]  Would I have a prenup?
[11028.42 --> 11029.22]  Yeah, probably
[11029.22 --> 11030.18]  Almost certainly
[11030.18 --> 11035.46]  And I have always viewed that as a sign as a as a
[11036.42 --> 11042.18]  And and and i've had the i've had the luxury of it because it never mattered when I like formed this opinion, right?
[11042.18 --> 11044.58]  Yeah, but I always viewed the prenup as
[11044.58 --> 11046.58]  As planning for failure
[11049.06 --> 11050.66]  If I was if I was
[11050.66 --> 11052.02]  I understand yeah
[11052.82 --> 11058.82]  If you asked me again today because I was single and and pursuing a long-term relationship
[11059.54 --> 11064.18]  I wouldn't I would say it's an insurance policy in case of a catastrophic
[11064.90 --> 11065.46]  disaster
[11067.62 --> 11074.90]  But I had the I had the luxury of being allowed to be naive because I did manage to find a relationship where
[11074.90 --> 11079.38]  It wasn't necessary it was never needed
[11080.10 --> 11080.34]  um
[11081.54 --> 11083.54]  so
[11084.26 --> 11085.86]  The point is that um
[11086.74 --> 11090.90]  I forget where we were going with this, but I saw a really great comment from fox in a box on floatplane
[11091.46 --> 11092.90]  um at luke and linus
[11092.90 --> 11099.46]  I think as you guys just discussed any issue can be overcome if both people are trying and sometimes the effort alone is more important than any issue
[11099.46 --> 11101.46]  And I just thought that was uh, that was really wise
[11104.42 --> 11108.90]  It's about what you built and you might have been able to build it with a variety of people like there's
[11109.62 --> 11115.06]  The the whole like there's only one fish in the sea for you and they happen to be in your hometown is just hilarious
[11116.18 --> 11122.02]  My thing my thing with yvonne is uh, I don't believe in soulmates, but yeah if I did then i'd buy it
[11123.86 --> 11125.86]  Yeah
[11125.86 --> 11130.74]  If I did i'd believe you're it yeah, yeah, which is which is great
[11130.90 --> 11135.70]  You want to ideally find someone that you're like yeah, this this could be if if that was true
[11135.70 --> 11138.34]  This person could be it. There's like no way it's true
[11138.90 --> 11146.18]  But what really builds that is the the effort and the work that you put into it and this this like castle that you collaboratively build together
[11146.74 --> 11147.86]  um
[11147.86 --> 11149.86]  That is ideally
[11150.74 --> 11152.74]  You know strong
[11152.74 --> 11162.74]  We are not getting through all these merch messages. No, but I have some curated ones for you literally have 40 more than we did before we started that one nice
[11163.38 --> 11164.82]  um question for linus
[11166.58 --> 11170.26]  How did you like the hydrafacial is it something you would recommend and will you be getting another one?
[11170.74 --> 11176.26]  Um, I don't know you tell me so i've i've always been transparent to a fault
[11176.26 --> 11184.98]  So the hydrafacial was step one and then after that I did morpheus eight which is uh three treatments of sub dermal
[11185.38 --> 11186.34]  um rf
[11186.58 --> 11188.90]  essentially and what it's meant to do is
[11189.46 --> 11190.50]  Radio frequency really?
[11190.50 --> 11191.70]  Yeah, so
[11191.70 --> 11196.66]  It essentially burns you. I was gonna say radio frequency is like a joke. Oh, it hurts a lot
[11196.98 --> 11200.98]  um, but what it's meant to do is damage the the sub
[11200.98 --> 11208.98]  Dermal layer or whatever layer that is in a way that stimulates collagen production, which is essentially what makes your skin
[11209.54 --> 11213.94]  Youthful you produce more of it when you're younger and as you age you produce less of it
[11213.94 --> 11217.06]  Yeah, so from my point of view and i've discussed this on the show before
[11217.70 --> 11224.58]  My mug is a business asset at a certain point and taking care of it like i'm i'm not i'm not into
[11224.58 --> 11229.30]  You know going out and dramatically altering my personal appearance, but if there's
[11230.02 --> 11232.18]  Pretty minor things that I can do to
[11232.90 --> 11236.82]  Maintain them as at least until we can you know go full
[11237.46 --> 11238.50]  uh vtuber
[11239.14 --> 11240.10]  um
[11240.10 --> 11243.70]  Then I see it as a I see it as a pretty worthwhile investment so
[11245.70 --> 11248.50]  I guess my answer to that question is
[11249.22 --> 11251.54]  I don't know if you guys tell me
[11251.54 --> 11256.18]  Uh, this is the first time this is was the first time i'd done anything so
[11260.58 --> 11263.22]  I have no idea yeah, I know um
[11263.86 --> 11267.70]  I'm, not really good with that stuff though. I didn't notice when you first shaved your beard off. Yeah
[11268.34 --> 11271.46]  My my aunt too. She thought she thought I got a haircut
[11272.42 --> 11278.10]  Which I technically I did yeah fair enough. Yeah, yeah, but she and my uncle they had dinner with me
[11278.10 --> 11280.74]  And they were like when they arrived home. They were like
[11287.38 --> 11292.42]  They're great that's pretty good um black smoke rise says I haven't noticed anything at all
[11293.06 --> 11296.18]  I guess it's working then because that's kind of the point
[11296.66 --> 11299.62]  The point is that if you if you do it, right
[11299.62 --> 11304.02]  It's supposed to look like you've done nothing at all. Um, you just look you know
[11304.66 --> 11306.26]  rested, right? Um
[11307.38 --> 11309.86]  Yeah, so there you go. That's uh
[11311.86 --> 11312.90]  That's it
[11313.38 --> 11316.18]  People mentioned your face was a bit redder than usual. Yeah, so in some of the videos
[11316.18 --> 11320.90]  Yeah, it's redder than usual because I just got stabbed a thousand times in the face
[11321.30 --> 11326.02]  Yeah, which hurts by the way. Yes happen. Um, however bad in the vision pro
[11326.34 --> 11329.78]  Uh, well here give me a sec, uh for the vision pro video
[11329.94 --> 11335.06]  Uh, it was the vision pro. Yes, uh, and any speculation that it was makeup or anything is silly
[11335.30 --> 11338.42]  Uh, it was just that it just doesn't fit me. It doesn't fit me very well
[11339.14 --> 11341.38]  Um, i'd say here. Let's see
[11343.86 --> 11346.26]  Oh, it's really hard because it's like it's kind of like a hot
[11346.98 --> 11349.30]  It's kind of like a hot pain, but it's like kind of in the
[11349.30 --> 11355.94]  It's weird because each shot is I think 24 needles at a time
[11356.98 --> 11358.18]  But it feels like one
[11359.06 --> 11362.90]  And they were explaining it to me. It's because like you only have so many nerves. Yeah, and so
[11363.86 --> 11367.14]  Multiple penetrations of the skin. I almost blacked out
[11367.78 --> 11372.50]  Last time because the first time you go the energy is pretty low and then they turn it up if you tolerate it
[11372.50 --> 11375.78]  Well, and the first time I tolerated it very well. So i'm i'm a fainter
[11375.78 --> 11381.30]  Um, which means any time that my skin gets broken and I experience any kind of blood loss
[11381.30 --> 11386.50]  It's like a it's like a they're they're not sure exactly what causes it whether it's physiological
[11387.14 --> 11389.54]  or psychological or some combination of the two
[11390.18 --> 11392.98]  um, I ran into one nurse once who told me that
[11394.90 --> 11397.62]  She wasn't one she got struck by lightning she became one
[11397.62 --> 11406.90]  Uh, but basically what happens is um, and so so nurses or anyone who does um a blood drawing or injections or anything
[11406.90 --> 11411.62]  Will will be familiar with the term but um, what it means is the second you
[11412.18 --> 11414.18]  Uh, your skin is broken
[11414.18 --> 11418.90]  Your your body basically goes into a semi state of shock. Oh, no
[11419.14 --> 11422.90]  Where it focuses on maintaining circulation to your vital organs
[11422.90 --> 11429.06]  And so what happens is whenever I get blood drawn, uh, my extremities go like immediately
[11429.78 --> 11431.62]  like immediately ice cold
[11432.26 --> 11432.58]  um
[11432.58 --> 11438.90]  And when I found this out, um, it was at a time when I was I was in quite a compromised state
[11438.90 --> 11441.22]  Like I was getting blood drawn because I was really sick
[11441.94 --> 11442.34]  and
[11442.34 --> 11443.62]  um
[11443.62 --> 11447.22]  This poor nurse she must have been like 90 pounds soaking wet
[11447.78 --> 11448.26]  um
[11448.26 --> 11452.82]  She's she's trying to draw blood from me and one of the challenges is that they got to be
[11452.82 --> 11455.14]  In there forever because my blood stops flowing
[11456.82 --> 11460.98]  Right so they take it from the arm and my body's all like yo, you made a hole in my arm
[11460.98 --> 11462.98]  I'm gonna keep all the blood here. Thank you very much
[11463.54 --> 11465.38]  So my blood stops flowing
[11465.86 --> 11471.46]  Um, so she's on like the fourth vein in the second arm by this point because I had forgotten
[11471.46 --> 11476.34]  I hadn't had blood taken in a long time and I'd forgotten that when I was a kid I needed a butter butterfly needle
[11476.34 --> 11478.50]  Um, because it's a smaller
[11479.14 --> 11480.42]  It's a smaller needle
[11480.90 --> 11483.78]  But with a with a wider uh inner diameter
[11484.10 --> 11487.46]  So they don't have to make as big of a hole and the blood flows more easily they're more expensive
[11487.46 --> 11488.74]  So you have to ask for them
[11489.22 --> 11493.94]  Um, so I forgot that I needed a butterfly needle or else it's really difficult to draw blood for me
[11493.94 --> 11497.62]  But it had been 10 or 15 years since I'd had blood drawn so I didn't remember
[11497.62 --> 11501.54]  Yeah, um, so anyway, she's like she's going at it like perforating my arm
[11501.86 --> 11505.30]  With this regular needle and not able to get any friggin blood out of it
[11505.86 --> 11507.86]  and all of a sudden
[11507.94 --> 11508.98]  I kind of i'm like
[11510.10 --> 11511.30]  Oh, um
[11511.30 --> 11515.22]  I'd never blacked out before but I was like, oh my vision's going kind of dark she goes
[11515.94 --> 11520.74]  You need to get your head between your legs right now because I cannot hold you in this chair
[11521.30 --> 11528.10]  It's just like tiny and I was in an elevated chair so that at a standing height it was easy for her to work on my arm
[11528.34 --> 11532.98]  Yeah, right? So yeah, so I would have just plowed into the ground. I would have broken my nose
[11533.62 --> 11536.58]  Like we would have had blood everywhere. Uh, never mind in the vials
[11537.14 --> 11538.66]  Mission accomplished that actually doesn't work
[11538.74 --> 11542.18]  And so she was the one who explained it to me after I didn't black out that time
[11542.18 --> 11546.58]  Uh, but she explained it to me, um, and she basically goes yeah, it's this it's this guy
[11546.58 --> 11548.50]  It's not a condition, but it's it's a thing
[11549.06 --> 11552.82]  Um, and so she had me lie down and she took my blood that way
[11552.82 --> 11556.98]  We we got the butterfly needle and she's like, okay, so you need to remember this you need a butterfly needle
[11556.98 --> 11559.94]  You need to tell people when they're drawing blood from you that you're a fainter
[11560.26 --> 11565.62]  So that they can put you somewhere where you're not gonna where you're not gonna black out and like crush them
[11566.42 --> 11566.74]  um
[11568.34 --> 11570.98]  Uh, where where where was I going with this I forget the question
[11572.18 --> 11574.90]  Uh, right so perforating my face
[11575.38 --> 11582.58]  No, so in this case I was actually lying down, but so I don't know if it was pain or if it was penetration
[11582.98 --> 11585.46]  Uh, because they can also go deeper. Do you bleed?
[11585.86 --> 11590.82]  Um, like I had like it looked like I nicked myself with a razor in like two spots by the end of it
[11590.98 --> 11597.06]  So in general, no, yeah, but you're red. Yeah, that's I was just wondering like is it the blood loss or is it?
[11597.06 --> 11602.82]  No, it's not blood loss. It's like I I I don't know they don't seem to really fully understand it
[11602.82 --> 11607.30]  Okay, uh, but I almost blacked out. I was like yo, uh, my vision starting to darken
[11607.94 --> 11610.18]  And she's like whoa, okay. Let me get you some chocolate
[11610.74 --> 11613.06]  um
[11613.06 --> 11613.78]  Apparently
[11613.78 --> 11616.98]  It's a fun side effect. Yeah, apparently some of the like botox
[11616.98 --> 11620.18]  It's pretty relatively common for people to black out but with this one
[11620.74 --> 11625.54]  She'd never seen it before and she's like, okay. Yeah, i'm like, okay, so i'm a fainter. I guess that applies to this
[11626.50 --> 11627.70]  good to know
[11627.70 --> 11634.98]  um, I did black out one time when um a buddy for an insurance company was taking blood from me at my house
[11635.62 --> 11638.18]  and um, what I remember was
[11638.18 --> 11643.70]  Uh me telling him. Hey, i'm a fainter. I was in the chair. Um, yeah, I I feel kind of faint
[11643.70 --> 11648.90]  I'm, just gonna go i'm gonna go over on that. Um, I have like the love sack is the brand
[11648.90 --> 11652.90]  But it's like a big bean bag. I'm gonna go over on that bean bag and um
[11654.18 --> 11657.22]  Give me a sec and I closed my eyes and I opened them
[11658.42 --> 11660.66]  And he's like you've been out for 10 minutes
[11660.66 --> 11665.62]  So, um, so that's a thing
[11666.98 --> 11668.34]  Um
[11668.34 --> 11671.06]  Not bryce says butterfly needle is a myth. I'm a nurse
[11671.62 --> 11674.58]  Uh blah blah blah blah something. No, it's not a myth
[11675.14 --> 11677.14]  I can tell you for an absolute fact
[11677.62 --> 11683.30]  That even if I am not looking they just can't get blood out of me without one. So, um, that's cool
[11683.46 --> 11685.46]  I'm glad that you have that expertise
[11685.46 --> 11687.46]  But as someone who actually
[11687.54 --> 11690.10]  Cannot have blood taken from them with a regular needle
[11690.10 --> 11694.26]  Um, and this has been confirmed by multiple
[11695.14 --> 11698.66]  Multiple nurses and technicians over the years
[11699.22 --> 11701.22]  um
[11702.02 --> 11702.42]  Sorry
[11705.78 --> 11706.10]  Yep
[11707.78 --> 11713.78]  Uh, okay more merch messages one for me, uh, luke my birds kirby and carl
[11714.58 --> 11718.90]  Finally like each other enough to snuggle and groom each other. What cool milestones have you hit with your birds?
[11718.90 --> 11721.46]  One thing that I like I always enjoy this is
[11721.94 --> 11722.34]  uh
[11723.06 --> 11724.42]  Learning to communicate with
[11725.06 --> 11729.14]  People or animals or whatever else with with language barriers obviously with animals
[11729.14 --> 11731.06]  There's gonna be language barriers, but um
[11732.58 --> 11733.06]  And like
[11733.86 --> 11736.58]  Learning habits and stuff so my birds for a long time there
[11737.06 --> 11739.22]  If we'd let them out to fly to get them to go to bed
[11739.54 --> 11741.06]  They have terrible night vision
[11741.06 --> 11746.58]  So I would turn most the the lights down and use like the the glowing from my computer and stuff like that so that I could see
[11747.22 --> 11751.46]  Um, and I would catch the birds in the dark and then physically put them back in their cage
[11752.18 --> 11757.14]  And that was the like nighttime activity and they knew it was coming because they'd see me get up and start turning the lights off
[11757.70 --> 11759.70]  And they'd start chirping and stuff
[11760.10 --> 11761.22]  Um
[11761.22 --> 11764.10]  I started to try to teach them to get back in the cage themselves
[11764.58 --> 11769.14]  And I would do that by like physically blocking off the other areas that they were at
[11769.22 --> 11771.94]  So sometimes they like to hang out just on top of the cage
[11771.94 --> 11774.18]  So I'd wait for them to come back to on top of the cage
[11774.90 --> 11776.74]  Then I would kind of dome my arms over
[11777.30 --> 11780.26]  To be like look I am blocking the flying up area
[11780.98 --> 11783.46]  And then if they like indicated they were going to go to a certain side
[11783.46 --> 11786.66]  I would shift over and block that and eventually try to like
[11787.46 --> 11794.82]  Kind of corral them over towards the edge of the cage and then make it so that the the easiest way for them to fly would be to fly
[11795.30 --> 11797.30]  into the cage
[11797.30 --> 11799.30]  And I this took a while
[11799.30 --> 11802.42]  To kind of train them to do but now at this point if
[11803.06 --> 11805.46]  If I just dome over the top of the cage like that
[11806.02 --> 11809.30]  They'll pretty much automatically just run to where the cage entrance is
[11809.30 --> 11810.98]  And then I don't even have to like do the rest of it
[11810.98 --> 11813.86]  They'll just hop off and fly into the door
[11813.86 --> 11817.70]  And that was pretty cool something someone pointed out is that in different regions
[11818.50 --> 11822.02]  There may be slightly different meanings so of what a butterfly needle is
[11822.02 --> 11827.78]  Yeah, so there are lots of different kinds and there's like it's the tape that goes on it that makes it a butterfly needle
[11828.10 --> 11835.14]  So here it means a particular thing it means a lower gauge that has a finer needle with a
[11836.10 --> 11840.50]  Sorry, I shouldn't say lower gauge because lower gauge is bigger, but because I don't know imperial measurements
[11841.54 --> 11844.98]  It means a finer needle that has a narrower wall
[11846.26 --> 11849.30]  In order to make it easier to to get into the vein
[11851.14 --> 11857.70]  Your mileage may vary maybe they have like gigantic thick thick wall butterfly needles where you are and it won't help at all
[11857.70 --> 11863.30]  So then if you are in a similar situation then what you would ask for is just a finer gauge needle or whatever
[11864.18 --> 11865.38]  So your mileage may vary
[11866.82 --> 11867.14]  All right
[11867.94 --> 11869.46]  Uh greetings ltt
[11870.18 --> 11876.42]  Greetings ltt some videos blur logos even on shirts why you work at media?
[11876.82 --> 11883.14]  I was curious what decides if you have to pay a brand or the brand has to pay you to have logo in content
[11884.42 --> 11886.42]  um
[11886.42 --> 11894.66]  Hold on I think for us it's more about that. We're just kind of inconsistent
[11895.78 --> 11896.10]  Okay
[11896.90 --> 11900.90]  Yeah, I mean there are cases where we're where we have a high level of intent
[11900.90 --> 11904.42]  When we cover a logo with gaff tape or when we don't
[11904.42 --> 11912.82]  Um, if a brand sponsor of a video is like hey, yo, i'm masseuse and I sponsored your video and you're using an msi monitor
[11912.82 --> 11916.26]  Look, i'm not super mad because like we weren't promoting monitors, but like
[11917.14 --> 11920.90]  Could you have not really brother? Yeah, then we'll go and we'll blur it. Um
[11922.02 --> 11924.34]  For monitors that we use on set a lot
[11925.14 --> 11929.14]  We try to kind of proactively just do it because like whatever
[11929.94 --> 11930.26]  um
[11931.46 --> 11935.14]  We get very very little product placement revenue
[11935.70 --> 11940.50]  Uh occasionally we've done stuff on wan show like I think that's the origin of these but secret lab
[11940.50 --> 11945.38]  Then we just kept them then we just like keep them forever because like what i'm gonna i'm gonna tape over it
[11945.38 --> 11947.38]  Yeah, like that just
[11947.70 --> 11954.10]  It feels really transactional if someone does do a sponsorship or something and then the second it's over
[11954.10 --> 11959.78]  We're like i'm gonna put tape on it. It's tape day. We're gonna spend money in order to yeah, I don't know
[11960.74 --> 11965.30]  In order to in order to get you less value for that deal that we did together like I don't know
[11965.30 --> 11971.14]  I'm, just I feel like i'm just not that petty if they want to update the chairs and pay us again or something like that like sure, but
[11972.02 --> 11974.02]  yeah
[11974.90 --> 11980.58]  AJ says i'm a fainter can confirm. I need to ask for the butterfly needle and usually need to be slightly reclined
[11981.54 --> 11982.98]  Yeah, yeah, sorry
[11984.66 --> 11987.70]  All right, what else we got? Um, I burned my curated
[11989.70 --> 11993.86]  Oh man, i'm for some reason i'm scrolled all the way down to archive we we have more than we had
[11994.34 --> 12000.42]  I um yeah, have you seen uh, so here's here's one some of these are just like meme like I can just click show
[12000.42 --> 12004.90]  Oh crap, yeah, because they're just an incoming the oh the ltd screwdriver has been made in the largest
[12005.46 --> 12007.70]  Uh man-made mine shaft on earth apparently
[12007.70 --> 12014.90]  I accidentally clicked show on that one been used in there. Yeah, mine mine shaft hold on. I archived it by accident
[12016.98 --> 12022.18]  Control left shaft. Oh, there's a lot of shaft. Oh, oh, right because many of our items have shafts
[12022.74 --> 12026.42]  It's not in the message. I get it. Oh, oh, there's a lot of shaft
[12026.42 --> 12031.94]  It's gotta be one of the greatest linus quotes, um, okay
[12033.54 --> 12037.14]  Uh, did you see the star wars battlefront re-release have you seen this?
[12038.58 --> 12043.94]  Wasn't in the uses like six to eight times the storage of the original games and like there's all kinds of problems
[12044.18 --> 12047.86]  I have i'm sure it's happened before i've personally never seen something on steam
[12048.58 --> 12053.14]  You know we we saw with palters gate 3 had to insert it somehow the show was almost over
[12053.14 --> 12057.06]  Um, we've seen with some games that they they get overwhelmingly positive
[12058.10 --> 12061.62]  This game i've never seen this before overwhelmingly negative reviews
[12063.30 --> 12071.30]  Never seen it before amazing. Uh, so yeah, the the merch message says they released the pc game from 2005 on multiple systems
[12071.54 --> 12077.70]  Or they really sorry it barely works and the original which is the same game runs much better
[12079.14 --> 12081.06]  That's a rip heck. Yeah, charles l
[12083.14 --> 12090.42]  Um, amando asks hey linus do you think that improvements in wafer yields by tsmc?
[12090.42 --> 12094.82]  For example have contributed to the death of the entry-level segment for both cpus and gpus
[12095.14 --> 12101.62]  I don't think it's improvements in wafer yields. I think it's increases in cost. It's just not worth building anything around
[12102.50 --> 12104.50]  um
[12105.22 --> 12112.66]  Such a at such a low price point. It's it's there's far better cost savings to be had by integrating things more
[12112.98 --> 12117.86]  Versus building an entire discrete product like why would you build a 50 dollar board around?
[12118.58 --> 12125.14]  uh a 50 gpu when you can build a 60 dollar board around a 100 gpu and sell that for 300 bucks
[12125.14 --> 12130.34]  You know like it's just not worth it when you could take that small amount of dye area and just put it right onto
[12130.98 --> 12136.02]  A cpu and get essentially the same benefit because it already had to have a memory controller in cash anyway
[12136.66 --> 12136.98]  um
[12136.98 --> 12137.54]  um
[12137.54 --> 12139.22]  I think it's more just
[12140.02 --> 12144.82]  The the general march towards more integration and less anything to do with tsmc's yields
[12145.86 --> 12146.74]  uh archive
[12147.86 --> 12149.30]  oh my gosh, uh, okay
[12149.94 --> 12151.30]  how about five more?
[12151.30 --> 12155.70]  That seem reasonable nope
[12158.34 --> 12159.06]  Oh
[12159.06 --> 12166.26]  Okay, gotta do all um, okay christian asks. I got my mystery color screwdriver amazing colors. Love it compared to my black driver
[12166.26 --> 12170.82]  The finish is not as perfect linus. What were the compromises you had to swallow and how hard was it for you?
[12171.38 --> 12173.38]  we basically had to
[12173.62 --> 12174.26]  um
[12174.26 --> 12177.30]  yeah, except that the the flow of the
[12178.26 --> 12180.58]  Of the plastic wouldn't quite be the same
[12180.58 --> 12184.02]  So if you look really closely at some of the color ones they have uh some swirl
[12184.50 --> 12187.94]  In the dye and in the color that is not present on the black ones and
[12188.90 --> 12189.46]  um
[12190.66 --> 12195.06]  That's the kind of thing you actually have to put a lot of work into to get exactly right
[12195.30 --> 12197.22]  I read a really interesting article about how
[12197.70 --> 12202.34]  The xbox series x they wanted to do it in white and realized um
[12202.34 --> 12206.74]  Oh, the only reason the black one looks good is because all of these swirls were hidden by the black color
[12206.74 --> 12210.58]  And they had to like completely redo the molds or something like that in order to make a white one
[12210.98 --> 12214.50]  Yeah, it's it's a color is really really really really really really hard
[12214.50 --> 12215.94]  So I basically was just like well
[12216.34 --> 12219.46]  I want multi-colored screwdrivers at ltx and we're gonna have them damn it. So
[12220.50 --> 12224.74]  Yeah, there's there's some imperfections, but they're really cool. So whatever they're cool. Damn it
[12225.62 --> 12227.62]  I'm over it
[12229.14 --> 12230.02]  Uh, hey, Dan
[12230.02 --> 12235.78]  We're gonna do like four more and then we're just gonna have to call it because there's simply too much like guys
[12236.66 --> 12239.06]  This is what we're dealing with here. Okay, we've got
[12239.70 --> 12245.38]  Uh, we've been live for four hours. We've had 1600 merch messages things have died down a little bit
[12245.38 --> 12248.90]  We're only getting about one a minute, but you guys think about it by this point in the show
[12249.14 --> 12252.10]  We've been down to zero a minute for quite some time
[12252.74 --> 12257.78]  And we're we're chewing through them. Whereas now we're still it takes us more than a minute to do
[12258.82 --> 12260.66]  A curated merch message. Oh, I mean
[12260.66 --> 12264.82]  They don't all go to curated. Yeah, but we also do a lot
[12265.78 --> 12268.18]  It takes a lot more than a minute on average. So
[12269.14 --> 12270.90]  I'm kind of fudging the numbers both ways
[12271.46 --> 12272.50]  There's also
[12272.50 --> 12275.46]  1114 left in the queue to display
[12275.70 --> 12279.54]  Yeah, so that will show up when we go to the outro. That'll be awesome. I'm excited about that
[12279.54 --> 12283.38]  I've been excited about that the whole show to be honest. I keep thinking about it. Yeah, because
[12283.38 --> 12288.50]  So exciting this is not I don't even know if this is the highest revenue and show we've ever done like when screwdriver
[12288.74 --> 12294.02]  Launched and backpack launched. I think it was higher revenue. Yeah, but in terms of item quantity
[12294.42 --> 12298.02]  I think it's the highest for that. I think this is also highest merch message
[12299.06 --> 12304.66]  Yeah, as well like this is ridiculous tax rate off shirts are over 2000 now
[12305.62 --> 12307.46]  um, oh my god
[12308.26 --> 12310.58]  dropout hoodies are over 500
[12312.26 --> 12318.18]  I was not expecting dropout hoodies to catch up like that. Oh, yeah, a fantastic hoodie for most t-shirts
[12319.06 --> 12321.06]  This is actually a record, huh
[12322.58 --> 12328.18]  This is a record all around. Nope. No. Are you sure? Yeah, okay
[12330.90 --> 12334.50]  Hold on, let me double check. Yeah, it is not a record for profit
[12337.46 --> 12341.78]  It is however a record for the inverse
[12342.34 --> 12343.30]  Ah, nice
[12344.34 --> 12351.38]  Actually, no, no, I'd say the record for loss is probably the one where I cut into the bottom of the backpack
[12353.54 --> 12357.86]  That was a very expensive when show nothing's gonna beat that like ever
[12360.82 --> 12362.10]  So good. Oh, man
[12362.10 --> 12368.18]  Uh, all right, so what like three or four more Dan's ready for these super checks after party stream already
[12368.18 --> 12371.62]  So let's we need to get a couple more. Yeah, I'm tired and you got places to be. Yep
[12374.98 --> 12377.38]  I'm scooting through. Is anyone? I'm trying to find them
[12378.18 --> 12380.66]  A lot of these are just like, uh, tax rate off. Let's go
[12380.66 --> 12382.66]  Oh
[12384.90 --> 12386.74]  Oh, oh, yeah, okay
[12387.14 --> 12393.54]  Uh, that's not your like pack alarm. No, that's an alarm to do a thing when I thought I would definitely be at home tonight
[12395.86 --> 12399.78]  Meanwhile, you're not gonna be home for like at least an hour if not more nice
[12401.70 --> 12406.50]  What is I got I got one I got one I got one I did it. Uh, what is Dan's?
[12406.50 --> 12412.34]  Okay, I'll read the whole thing. I got my bread plush. Also, I want to expand on the question asked a couple weeks ago
[12412.58 --> 12414.50]  What is Dan's favorite retro game?
[12415.94 --> 12417.94]  Oh, man, does this even count as retro?
[12417.94 --> 12421.30]  PlayStation 1 this game called yes, I'm honder by
[12422.02 --> 12424.66]  Square before they were square enix it's a
[12426.42 --> 12428.50]  Side-scrolling space shooter thing
[12429.70 --> 12434.66]  Extremely difficult extremely complicated. It has like seven levels or something like that you have ammo management
[12434.66 --> 12436.66]  You have weapon management. You have placement management
[12437.14 --> 12440.26]  It's one of those games that you get hit once and you're you're dead
[12440.74 --> 12444.58]  And then there's no checkpoints. You basically have to restart after you run out of lives
[12445.54 --> 12446.98]  Um, so extremely skill-based
[12447.78 --> 12450.50]  excellent. So good. So so good
[12452.18 --> 12454.18]  Is is playstation one even retro
[12454.82 --> 12459.38]  The time that was like five years ago that came out glad you enjoy the tracksuit pants kevin g
[12459.38 --> 12465.86]  Just ordered another pair of them and congrats on losing 20 pounds. Heck. Yeah. Keep it up, brother. Good work. Oh, yeah
[12465.86 --> 12468.58]  It's basically like uh square made toho
[12469.54 --> 12476.10]  That's a that's a good comparison bullet hell, but also not it's like a tech bullet hell game great 10 out of 10
[12480.10 --> 12483.06]  Luke you're clicking things so fast. I can't even read them
[12483.06 --> 12489.62]  You just want them all to scroll past. Yeah, do they not scroll past if we don't click show? I don't actually know
[12489.62 --> 12490.58]  I don't know
[12490.58 --> 12496.26]  I want them to scroll past no matter what. Uh, okay. I just and I am actually i'm scanning to see like does this one have a question?
[12496.66 --> 12498.66]  That's all i'm looking for
[12498.66 --> 12500.66]  If it doesn't have a question, I just zoom
[12502.98 --> 12503.86]  Uh, someone asks
[12505.06 --> 12507.86]  What kind of screws am I supposed to use with these magnet things?
[12509.14 --> 12510.26]  Screws
[12510.26 --> 12515.70]  Oh, well, they come with little screws, but they also just like have a hole in the plate and you could put any screw you want into it
[12516.18 --> 12519.70]  So if you okay, for example, I used a masonry
[12520.34 --> 12521.94]  screws when I
[12521.94 --> 12525.86]  Um, have you seen this? No, I don't think so my gate in my backyard
[12527.14 --> 12527.86]  so
[12527.86 --> 12529.54]  I screwed um
[12530.82 --> 12532.74]  A uh, I put a little strap
[12533.46 --> 12535.30]  across the uh
[12535.54 --> 12539.86]  Or sorry, I I put a little strap across the cable arch like one of the big ones
[12540.26 --> 12541.38]  And I put it on my gate
[12541.94 --> 12545.54]  And then I used masonry screws on the other side for the metal plates
[12546.10 --> 12548.74]  And I screwed them into like these bricks that are there
[12548.82 --> 12552.10]  So when I open my gate my cable management arch holds it open
[12553.06 --> 12557.78]  Everything else I tried like I would I would wedge stuff under it and the wind just kind of rips through there and slams the gate
[12557.78 --> 12560.74]  Shut but that would hold but this holds so i'm very happy
[12560.74 --> 12562.82]  For gondor dude, let's go
[12562.82 --> 12564.66]  I'll do it
[12578.66 --> 12579.22]  I'll do it
[12579.22 --> 12583.78]  Man i'm just clicking show on things i'm clicking i'm clicking so hard i'm trying to i'm trying to david ss
[12583.78 --> 12584.90]  Right off i'm rich
[12589.46 --> 12595.14]  Oh man people are ordering so much stuff our 3pl is like screwed
[12595.86 --> 12596.18]  um
[12598.02 --> 12600.82]  Yeah, we already kind of answered that earlier so forget it
[12601.54 --> 12601.86]  um
[12602.74 --> 12608.18]  Hi luke, I applied for a software engineering role and i'm curious does your team often hire us citizens? Thanks. Yeah
[12609.06 --> 12613.30]  But as contractors not employees. Yeah, that's yeah, that's the whole thing. Yeah
[12617.62 --> 12622.66]  Show you got anything luke come on i'm i've scroll so many of these are like
[12623.54 --> 12625.06]  Aussie here. Thanks for the free shipping
[12626.90 --> 12630.66]  I work I study I sleep the tired never leaves fpga gaming's cool chase
[12630.66 --> 12632.66]  Um
[12636.50 --> 12641.46]  Okay here, how about this one? I got one for you here luke here's one for you while i continue to go through things okay
[12646.10 --> 12648.74]  Oh you curated it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[12651.14 --> 12659.06]  Uh oh uh this is a good one from travis hey dynas duke and oh glorious dan leader of all what current product of yours do you think will get a v2
[12659.54 --> 12660.58]  first
[12660.82 --> 12663.46]  What favorite product of mine? I know the answer to this
[12665.06 --> 12671.86]  What oh wait, it says current product damn. I was gonna say when hoodie v2 because it like happened already. Oh, um
[12672.42 --> 12675.62]  Hmm v2 out of current products backpack
[12676.90 --> 12678.34]  No
[12678.34 --> 12683.22]  Would you consider the costed down one of v2? No, that's a separate product they'll coexist
[12683.54 --> 12689.54]  Okay, and like the backpack with the actual double layer and yeah, no, no, no, no, that was just 1.1. That one's fine. Yeah, yeah
[12689.54 --> 12690.34]  um
[12691.94 --> 12694.66]  I was I was only saying that because of the the cost of down
[12694.66 --> 12697.86]  I mean, we'd be crazy if we weren't examining based on how many we've sold
[12697.86 --> 12701.30]  We'd be crazy if we weren't examining like a screwdriver v2 at some point, but
[12701.30 --> 12703.06]  That's sure as heck won't come first
[12703.06 --> 12705.30]  Yeah, I don't I don't think that needs to come soon years away
[12705.30 --> 12710.02]  It's a really good screwdriver and there's nothing that out competes it so that we're gonna we're gonna
[12710.02 --> 12716.18]  Continue to sell it and amortize the cost of development for as long as we as long as it makes sense
[12716.66 --> 12717.78]  um
[12717.78 --> 12720.74]  It's a really good screwdriver what would get a v2
[12721.78 --> 12722.90]  I
[12722.90 --> 12727.38]  Don't know I could see us. I could see us rejigging northern lights desk pad
[12728.02 --> 12731.70]  Doing like kind of just an updated style but still you know northern lights
[12731.70 --> 12736.58]  But then there's so many opportunities for design like why not just do something entirely new too much of our stuff
[12736.58 --> 12741.38]  Not that this is actually a problem. I'm using the term too much as if that's bad, but it's not a bad thing
[12741.38 --> 12744.26]  too much of our stuff is like so overbuilt that like
[12745.62 --> 12746.82]  What are you gonna do?
[12746.82 --> 12747.62]  Well, what do you
[12748.26 --> 12751.62]  You got it right the first time. Yeah, how are you gonna v2 this?
[12752.90 --> 12754.90]  I don't know whatever. How about towels?
[12756.26 --> 12761.70]  V2 to for towels. Can you make them more absorbent? I don't know. Well, we could update the design a little
[12761.70 --> 12763.70]  Can they are they flying carpets now? Um
[12764.50 --> 12770.26]  I don't know. Uh anyways, hey DLO. I'm about to graduate and need advice on joining the software engineering workforce
[12771.62 --> 12773.78]  I've only ever been a tech sales consultant
[12775.06 --> 12779.78]  And I have yet to give ideas for a side project. What should I do slash make?
[12786.10 --> 12787.14]  Oh, no
[12787.94 --> 12793.54]  I know the answer what something you're really passionate about. Oh, there you go something that says something about
[12793.54 --> 12795.54]  You the free one
[12795.54 --> 12797.54]  Got them. Yeah
[12797.62 --> 12799.94]  Got lots of updates on labs. Shane. Oh kids book
[12801.06 --> 12807.46]  A v2. Yeah, I'm not gonna do a v2. Why because I would write a different book. Yeah, that's not a v2
[12807.94 --> 12811.94]  No, I would do the alphabet of gaming or something like that. Why don't you do it?
[12813.86 --> 12815.86]  You have time
[12815.86 --> 12819.54]  Sure
[12819.54 --> 12820.82]  Sure
[12820.82 --> 12826.98]  Right one on the plane. Oh, yeah, what are you just yeah, right? You're on vacation. Just right continue working
[12826.98 --> 12833.22]  What's wrong with you? Yvonne can drive to work and you can write it in the passenger seat. I probably could write it on the plane
[12834.90 --> 12835.70]  Hey
[12835.70 --> 12840.10]  The fact the fact that the author of like basic kids books
[12840.98 --> 12844.26]  Gets first billing and the illustrator goes second is a crime
[12845.22 --> 12851.54]  Sarah put so much more work into the first book than I did. Yeah, she did a great job. Yeah, it's awesome
[12852.82 --> 12857.94]  Shay made me read I want my hat back by john class and and it's changed my life
[12858.34 --> 12860.34]  I wish all kids books were that good
[12861.54 --> 12863.54]  um
[12863.54 --> 12873.54]  Hey DLL so excited to see the mystery color. How do you all measure success in your lives outside of views on videos?
[12875.78 --> 12879.38]  It's so deep it's so easy to just say happiness
[12880.18 --> 12884.58]  But there's so many elements that contribute to happiness. It's like it's one of those things where people
[12885.54 --> 12887.54]  um
[12887.54 --> 12891.46]  I feel like it's such an out-of-touch thing for people to say when they say money doesn't buy happiness
[12891.46 --> 12893.46]  Because it's true
[12893.46 --> 12895.46]  There are lots of people
[12895.78 --> 12902.82]  With a lot of money who don't really seem very happy. They seem they seem angry. They seem depressed. They seem
[12903.54 --> 12905.54]  um, they seem lost, you know
[12906.34 --> 12907.22]  but
[12907.22 --> 12909.22]  for most people
[12910.34 --> 12914.34]  A lack of money. Yeah, I think sure it's significantly to unhappiness
[12914.34 --> 12918.74]  There's a ton of people where money could solve the problems that are making them unhappy. Yes
[12918.74 --> 12922.58]  But there are also people that money could not solve the problems or make them unhappy
[12922.58 --> 12924.98]  But I think right now in our current economic climate
[12924.98 --> 12928.42]  There is significantly more people that money could solve the problems
[12928.42 --> 12934.50]  So I think that I think if I was to say okay, there's a measure of success. I would say it's to have enough
[12937.14 --> 12937.54]  Not
[12938.34 --> 12943.22]  I think I think too much of anything is bad. This is in your lives. Oh in our lives personally
[12943.22 --> 12945.06]  Oh, I mean
[12945.86 --> 12950.66]  Well, then i'm just gonna take the cop-out answers like relationships, right? Like it's uh
[12951.30 --> 12952.26]  if I had
[12953.22 --> 12956.10]  If I had the fastest gaming pc in the world
[12956.90 --> 12959.22]  And no one to play games with what would it mean?
[12960.98 --> 12962.34]  Be worthless
[12962.34 --> 12967.46]  Yeah, for um, I I often oh, sorry. I thought you're done. No, no, go ahead. I often go on two things
[12968.98 --> 12969.30]  um
[12969.30 --> 12971.30]  I
[12971.70 --> 12976.98]  Don't necessarily need everyone to like me but respect of peers is very important to me
[12977.86 --> 12978.98]  um
[12978.98 --> 12980.66]  and then
[12980.74 --> 12982.74]  What is my like current?
[12982.98 --> 12986.34]  There's there's like an overall assessment you can kind of do
[12987.22 --> 12990.42]  Self-satisfaction. Yeah, but not like in a smug way. No
[12991.14 --> 12994.98]  Um, and it doesn't mean that you have to be the best. It just means doing your best. Yeah
[12994.98 --> 13000.50]  And like how am I I set out these previous goals for myself am I making previous
[13001.06 --> 13003.06]  version of me?
[13003.06 --> 13003.86]  Proud
[13003.86 --> 13007.70]  Am I setting up future version of me for success if these things are true?
[13008.10 --> 13010.34]  I'm probably gonna feel pretty good about myself
[13010.90 --> 13012.90]  Doesn't have to be perfect
[13012.90 --> 13018.82]  But am I doing a good job and there's there's like little there's little things i'll try to do like if I you know, I take the stairs
[13018.82 --> 13021.22]  When the next day comes
[13021.94 --> 13025.78]  If i'm like i'm tired and I want to default to the elevator i'm like well previously
[13027.06 --> 13027.38]  I
[13027.94 --> 13029.30]  Got myself over to the stairs
[13030.50 --> 13034.34]  If yesterday me was able to do it today me's gotta be able to figure it out
[13034.34 --> 13038.42]  And then that motivates me to get over to the stairs. I don't know little things like that
[13042.18 --> 13043.70]  I always tell my kids like I don't
[13046.66 --> 13051.86]  Are you trying your best they know that there are two things that are going to set me off more than anything else
[13051.86 --> 13056.02]  It's if they lie to me and it's if they're not trying their best. Yeah, um
[13057.54 --> 13064.10]  And kids will do kids will do that all the time they'll they'll uh, we went skiing um a couple weekends ago and
[13064.34 --> 13065.54]  um
[13065.54 --> 13068.66]  We were going up a little hill and I
[13069.54 --> 13076.26]  My youngest I was like, okay, so do the do the skating thing because I saw her do it the previous weekend and she
[13076.90 --> 13078.90]  Just went side to side
[13079.70 --> 13081.70]  We had a chat
[13083.62 --> 13086.58]  Because I have no problem taking off my board
[13087.62 --> 13089.54]  Grabbing it and hauling her up the hill
[13090.34 --> 13093.70]  I have no problem with that. I'm i'm i'm happy. I like it
[13094.34 --> 13095.06]  I'm a dad
[13095.70 --> 13098.50]  Of course. I like you know carrying my little girl, right?
[13104.26 --> 13104.50]  But
[13105.86 --> 13107.46]  The fact that she didn't try
[13107.46 --> 13115.78]  If she tried and she was tired or if she tried and you know, there was a problem with her binding or whatever
[13116.02 --> 13120.58]  Yeah, no problem swooping in i'd love to help. Yeah, but if she's going to to my face
[13121.54 --> 13123.54]  Not do her best
[13123.54 --> 13130.10]  To me, it's like it's it's essentially the same thing. It's not being honest to me. It's not being honest to yourself. It's not
[13131.06 --> 13132.10]  um
[13132.18 --> 13133.62]  It's not respectable
[13133.62 --> 13135.62]  I guess to your point
[13135.78 --> 13136.26]  um
[13136.26 --> 13137.06]  Yeah
[13137.06 --> 13141.78]  Fortunately, she's still a little kid and uh, I think she's she's getting a lot better
[13142.66 --> 13147.30]  Which is which is kind of got it this is the absolute best time for her to figure that stuff out
[13147.46 --> 13150.58]  So like yeah, yeah, whatever not something to dwell on
[13152.82 --> 13154.82]  Okay
[13155.78 --> 13157.78]  What why do I even read twitch chat?
[13158.50 --> 13164.02]  Hey, what would be really cool is a very thin undershirt with long sleeves with thumb hooks
[13164.50 --> 13167.38]  So you could wear your uniform over it and gloves on your hands
[13167.94 --> 13173.46]  So when you pick up a very gross person, you don't have to worry about their stuff getting on your arms, but also breathable good luck
[13174.82 --> 13177.86]  It sounds like someone who's like a firefighter. Yeah, or something like that
[13178.42 --> 13180.42]  That sounds like a very specialized
[13180.58 --> 13185.62]  Piece of equipment and not the sort of thing that um, we're likely to have on ltdstore.com. Sounds cool though
[13186.66 --> 13188.82]  Also, good luck. Uh, yeah
[13190.90 --> 13193.14]  Okay, one more pick a good one luke
[13193.78 --> 13197.62]  There's so many just like throwaway ones. It's crazy
[13198.74 --> 13203.38]  Uh, and mine I have mine only loading 75 so that it performs super fast
[13204.50 --> 13206.50]  I went for the performance option
[13207.14 --> 13209.14]  That's not loading all of them
[13209.38 --> 13212.66]  Well, I was reading one that I thought was pretty good and then it just jumped
[13214.10 --> 13215.38]  Oh, here's a good one. Jeff M
[13216.18 --> 13222.42]  Asks, what do you think is the most important piece of equipment to not skimp on when getting into youtube not including the computer?
[13223.38 --> 13226.10]  Also, if you don't answer this does it become a write-off? We'll never know
[13226.66 --> 13228.66]  Um, i'd say the most important thing is a microphone
[13229.86 --> 13234.58]  Got him. Yeah, he was so ready. Did you see how ready he was? I was incredibly ready. He was like
[13235.46 --> 13238.10]  I was so ready physically ready emotionally ready
[13238.98 --> 13240.02]  psychologically ready
[13240.58 --> 13246.98]  Spiritually ready all of them every part of him was ready. He was sexually ready. Yeah, and I am sexually ready
[13248.66 --> 13250.66]  For us to see you again next week
[13251.46 --> 13253.46]  Same bad time
[13253.46 --> 13255.46]  same bad channel
[13255.46 --> 13261.14]  We're gonna see you floaters. Uh, anyone subscribe to float plane. We'll see you guys on the after party. We're gonna play some super checks. Yes
[13261.14 --> 13263.14]  Good night. Bye
[13266.74 --> 13268.74]  Oh my god
[13268.98 --> 13273.06]  It almost broke it. Oh, it looks like it's lagging and it's like oh my god
[13275.46 --> 13278.66]  That was insane that was sick. I love it
[13278.66 --> 13287.78]  I can't believe how much stuff we sold at a loss
[13289.14 --> 13289.70]  It's the
