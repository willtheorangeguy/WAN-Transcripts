[0.00 --> 6.36]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN Show. I'm coming to you live from the
[6.36 --> 13.86]  western side of the Pacific and we've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[14.18 --> 23.20]  The big story this week is obviously that Apple is being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice.
[23.20 --> 32.74]  In other almost equally big news, I was featured in a song from Smosh and it was gone sexual.
[33.66 --> 34.72]  Extremely sexual.
[36.28 --> 41.64]  Yeah. LinkedIn thinks gaming at work is cool and your entire company should compete against
[41.64 --> 45.44]  other companies, which is exciting and also a terrible idea, which we'll discuss later.
[45.86 --> 50.70]  And I don't know if you mentioned this or not, but Apex Legends, it was hacked mid-tournament
[50.70 --> 54.44]  in like a big way that sort of ruined everything.
[55.08 --> 55.94]  We'll talk about that.
[56.42 --> 58.22]  I didn't know that hacking works like that.
[58.36 --> 59.60]  All right, let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[59.66 --> 60.26]  I can't do it.
[60.30 --> 61.14]  Luke has to do it.
[61.14 --> 62.42]  Oh, uh...
[80.70 --> 85.08]  Jawa, Ugreen, and Apex.
[85.08 --> 85.14]  Jawa, Ugreen.
[85.14 --> 87.08]  Jawa, Ugreen.
[87.08 --> 89.02]  Okay, well, we were both doing it.
[89.08 --> 89.72]  So that's great.
[90.16 --> 90.48]  Nice.
[90.48 --> 91.68]  Absolutely fantastic.
[91.92 --> 92.10]  All right.
[92.64 --> 96.14]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic?
[96.64 --> 105.52]  And if you're a frequenter of r slash Apple, you're going to have to grab your copium supplements
[105.52 --> 108.12]  because this is going to be pretty hard to hear.
[108.70 --> 114.10]  But the reason that I am happy about this news is not that I hate Apple.
[114.16 --> 119.20]  In fact, those of you who were here for the pre-show on Flowplane and Twitch will have seen
[119.20 --> 120.88]  that I daily drive AirPods.
[121.34 --> 128.02]  I actually use Apple products as part of my life and even pay a lot of money for them.
[128.30 --> 130.06]  Do you know how you know I pay a lot of money for them?
[131.70 --> 133.14]  Because they're made by Apple.
[133.58 --> 134.56]  Oh, fair enough.
[134.56 --> 135.56]  And I have...
[135.56 --> 139.64]  Uh-oh.
[139.80 --> 140.48]  We lost him.
[141.82 --> 144.78]  While we hopefully get him back, I'm just going to start reading the topic.
[145.12 --> 145.66]  Yeah, he's back.
[145.96 --> 146.46]  He's back?
[148.08 --> 148.62]  Should be.
[149.38 --> 149.74]  Cool.
[149.98 --> 150.42]  He's back.
[150.54 --> 150.74]  Okay.
[150.88 --> 152.66]  Do you want to tune the bandwidth down a little bit?
[153.24 --> 156.40]  Actually, let's have Luke read the topic and I'll be right back.
[156.76 --> 157.14]  Sounds good.
[157.52 --> 159.56]  Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice...
[160.24 --> 161.46]  Wow, that would be a cool department.
[161.46 --> 166.42]  The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorneys General from more than a dozen states filed
[166.42 --> 170.28]  a lawsuit against Apple for monopolizing smartphone markets.
[170.28 --> 177.90]  In the DOJ's most significant antitrust lawsuit since its, like, amazingly massive case against
[177.90 --> 184.36]  Microsoft in 1998, in which Microsoft was accused of acting anti-competitively to push
[184.36 --> 187.66]  Internet Explorer, if any of you even remember that, on users.
[187.66 --> 194.56]  Epic Games' Fortnite lawsuit only claimed that Apple had a monopoly on the iOS software distribution
[194.56 --> 194.92]  market.
[195.34 --> 201.02]  This lawsuit concerns Apple's effects on the smartphone market at large.
[201.52 --> 202.10]  The whole thing.
[202.52 --> 209.10]  iPhones account for around 56% of the U.S. smartphone market, having passed the 50% mark in 2020.
[210.16 --> 211.36]  The case in a nutshell.
[211.36 --> 216.22]  The government complaint cites pretty much every complaint about iOS brought up by users
[216.22 --> 217.32]  in recent memory.
[217.82 --> 223.06]  This includes Apple blocking third-party app stores, payment systems, and sideloading on
[223.06 --> 228.08]  iOS, intentionally obstructing cross-platform features in apps like Apple Messages, making
[228.08 --> 231.78]  it seem to iPhone users like Android phones are to blame.
[231.78 --> 236.08]  So you should, you know, just buy your mom an iPhone, that quote.
[236.38 --> 240.14]  A line that the DOJ quotes specifically in its document.
[240.32 --> 241.28]  You can look up that clip.
[241.44 --> 242.34]  It's pretty great.
[243.26 --> 245.00]  Suppressing cloud streaming services.
[245.12 --> 250.06]  Apple did recently change their global policies to allow services like Xbox Cloud Streaming and
[250.06 --> 254.08]  GeForce Now to host their game streaming library in a single iOS app.
[254.54 --> 257.62]  Also, refusing to add Android support to Apple Watch.
[257.62 --> 263.46]  In response, Apple told 9to5Mac they investigated this possibility for three years, concluding
[263.46 --> 266.20]  it wasn't doable because of technical limitations.
[266.92 --> 268.14]  Also, forcing third-party...
[268.14 --> 268.62]  Now, can I...
[268.62 --> 268.74]  Hold on.
[268.82 --> 269.48]  Can I...
[269.48 --> 269.92]  I'm a...
[269.92 --> 271.62]  Look, I'm gonna let you finish, but...
[272.52 --> 273.62]  Can I just call...
[274.14 --> 276.10]  I don't have my bleep button, so...
[276.10 --> 277.64]  So I'll have to come up with a creative name.
[277.64 --> 278.70]  Just manually do it.
[280.82 --> 281.78]  Oxenmanure.
[281.78 --> 290.40]  On that, there is absolutely no way that a company the size of Apple with Apple's resources
[290.40 --> 295.02]  could not find any meaningful way to get the Apple Watch working.
[295.16 --> 298.42]  I don't think that people even would have expected feature parity.
[298.94 --> 303.78]  I mean, as an Android user with AirPods, I understand that I'm a bit of a second-class citizen.
[303.78 --> 311.46]  There are certain things that, you know, I get, you know, are not necessarily going to
[311.46 --> 311.72]  work.
[311.82 --> 317.76]  Like, if Apple is using, you know, a special proprietary codec or something like that to
[317.76 --> 322.06]  enable their spatial nonsense, it's like, okay, yeah, you know what, maybe I don't get
[322.06 --> 322.34]  that.
[322.68 --> 324.92]  But there are certain things...
[324.92 --> 329.26]  No, this is them degrading the experience because they...
[332.06 --> 332.76]  Malicious...
[332.76 --> 334.98]  I shouldn't say malicious, but because they...
[336.60 --> 337.48]  Oh, man.
[337.94 --> 338.66]  Arrogance...
[338.76 --> 340.16]  The word escapes me right now.
[340.16 --> 344.88]  But basically because they don't respect me enough for not buying enough of their products
[344.88 --> 346.06]  to put in the work for me.
[346.06 --> 353.32]  The fact that I can't alter what the long presses of the stems do unless I buy an iPhone
[353.32 --> 356.26]  and connect it to an iPhone, that's really bad.
[356.62 --> 364.38]  The fact that I cannot update the firmware in any way without a Bluetooth connection to
[364.38 --> 366.00]  an iPhone is...
[366.00 --> 366.66]  That's just...
[368.74 --> 372.82]  They just obviously hate their users.
[373.10 --> 373.88]  It's...
[373.88 --> 374.54]  Yeah, it's...
[374.54 --> 374.96]  There you go.
[375.04 --> 376.34]  Thank you, Lightning Man GTS.
[376.46 --> 377.28]  It's spiteful.
[377.28 --> 384.38]  There's absolutely no way that they shouldn't be able to update the firmware some other way.
[384.46 --> 389.46]  They just design the product in such a way that it just won't work.
[389.80 --> 391.12]  And they do it on purpose.
[391.12 --> 401.08]  A part of me is willing to sort of consider a little bit that everyone at Apple probably just,
[401.08 --> 408.80]  you know, enemas the Kool-Aid all day, every day, and can't even imagine a world where
[408.80 --> 411.68]  you just wouldn't have an iPhone.
[412.38 --> 414.62]  So it's not a problem at all.
[414.62 --> 419.08]  So, you know, why would we have a way for you to, you know, connect to the case via a
[419.08 --> 421.72]  wire and have it, you know, push that way or something?
[421.82 --> 428.10]  And I understand that the case is just for charging or whatever, except that it's not
[428.10 --> 431.84]  because they can definitely communicate with the AirPods via the case.
[431.98 --> 433.40]  So I don't know.
[434.34 --> 438.60]  So I can understand why they just wouldn't consider it when they're designing the product.
[440.38 --> 444.46]  But it just happens too consistently to the point where it has to be on purpose.
[444.62 --> 448.66]  At this point, I think that's essentially what the DOJ is getting at is that we've got this
[448.66 --> 456.54]  long history of Apple designing their products for minimum interoperability and then basically
[456.54 --> 459.70]  shrugging and going, buy more of our stuff.
[460.22 --> 460.60]  Okay, Luke.
[460.68 --> 460.84]  Sorry.
[460.96 --> 461.38]  Go ahead.
[461.46 --> 461.68]  Go ahead.
[462.24 --> 462.84]  Yeah, no worries.
[463.36 --> 469.58]  To continue the citations from the government, forcing third-party payment services to use
[469.58 --> 476.50]  Apple wallet, blocking super apps like WeChat, Alipay, and other apps that also serve as platforms
[476.50 --> 482.22]  for mini apps and thus reduce the user's dependence on Apple's own features and more.
[482.36 --> 483.36]  There's tons.
[483.64 --> 490.30]  The DOJ even says CarPlay is anti-competitive, which was actually kind of interesting to me.
[490.42 --> 491.02]  But anyways.
[491.02 --> 492.02]  Yeah.
[492.02 --> 494.40]  So that doesn't make sense on the surface.
[494.86 --> 502.68]  But if you click through, what they're alluding to is actually a CarPlay future, not the state
[502.68 --> 504.22]  of CarPlay right now.
[504.72 --> 510.64]  So Apple is apparently telling auto manufacturers that in the future, if they want to be able
[510.64 --> 516.52]  to support CarPlay, they're going to have to enable Apple to take control of all the screens
[516.52 --> 520.38]  in the car, not just a windowed screen.
[520.94 --> 526.72]  And this is really frustrating to me because one of the issues that I've had with Teslas,
[526.86 --> 533.76]  for example, one of my main reasons for not being interested in a Tesla for years, even
[533.76 --> 536.76]  though on paper it was like, what, you're like a tech guy.
[537.18 --> 538.64]  You should just have a Tesla, right?
[538.64 --> 543.44]  One of my main issues was that I was locked into Tesla's operating system.
[543.56 --> 548.30]  So yeah, I could use Google Maps as long as Tesla decided I could use Google Maps.
[548.42 --> 551.80]  Like I couldn't just plug in my phone and use whatever I wanted.
[552.38 --> 557.96]  And it's been shown now that you could totally, even in a Tesla, just run Android Auto or run
[557.96 --> 564.00]  CarPlay in a window and get all of that functionality that you want that way instead of relying on
[564.00 --> 567.36]  Tesla's own entertainment operator.
[567.36 --> 570.30]  But I was like, no, this is absolutely perfect.
[570.84 --> 575.64]  I'd never have to be at the mercy of the car manufacturer who, and Tesla, you know what,
[575.70 --> 579.18]  to their credit has been a lot better than traditional car manufacturers about this.
[579.36 --> 583.34]  But I still just don't trust car manufacturers to keep their software up to date.
[583.50 --> 587.94]  Whereas I trust myself to keep buying a new phone every time I need one, which as it turns out,
[587.94 --> 591.42]  it's not very often, but I can do that.
[591.78 --> 595.24]  And then I can just bring, yeah, I can just bring that new experience with me.
[596.12 --> 601.40]  And this, I didn't realize, would totally take that.
[601.62 --> 605.96]  Because all I wanted was my phone to run in a little window on my dashboard.
[606.08 --> 608.92]  I don't want my phone to completely take over the car.
[608.92 --> 614.20]  I want my car to work like my car should, and my phone to work like my phone should.
[614.70 --> 618.94]  And then just, I can listen to whatever music I want on playlists that I have stored on my phone.
[619.00 --> 619.32]  That's it.
[619.38 --> 620.50]  That's all I'm asking for.
[620.82 --> 626.56]  And I just don't understand why companies like Apple have to flex like this and impose their will.
[626.74 --> 628.06]  Like, God, who cares?
[628.72 --> 629.92]  You already sold the iPhone.
[631.70 --> 632.44]  Sorry, go ahead.
[632.54 --> 632.80]  Go ahead.
[632.80 --> 634.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[634.14 --> 637.44]  And by the way, no, I was not rapping or doing weird gestures.
[637.72 --> 641.64]  I was bringing liberty and freedom to a bug that was bothering me.
[642.46 --> 643.86]  Anyways, moving on.
[644.16 --> 647.30]  Apple issued a statement saying that the lawsuit threatens who we are
[647.30 --> 652.18]  and would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple,
[652.34 --> 654.98]  where hardware, software, and services intersect.
[655.82 --> 657.06]  Many parallels are being drawn.
[657.06 --> 658.84]  I'm sorry, I'm going to have to interrupt you again right here.
[659.38 --> 661.60]  Because I actually agree with that.
[661.60 --> 665.08]  I agree extremely strongly with that.
[666.20 --> 674.88]  This lawsuit definitely is because Apple are anti-competitive assholes.
[676.22 --> 678.82]  And this would threaten that in a big way.
[680.16 --> 685.94]  As for whether it would hinder their ability to create the kind of technology that people expect from Apple,
[685.98 --> 687.02]  I don't think it would at all.
[687.02 --> 692.34]  If anything, I think this would open up the kind of technology that Apple creates,
[692.50 --> 694.68]  which is really great, honestly, a lot of the time.
[694.84 --> 699.72]  I think it would open up that technology to a wider array of users.
[702.24 --> 704.16]  So, cool, I guess.
[704.32 --> 706.60]  I really just, I'm afraid I just don't see a downside.
[706.60 --> 711.46]  And the thing is that the arguments that you'll get from, I don't know what to call them.
[711.54 --> 713.40]  And I realize this is extremely disrespectful.
[714.74 --> 716.46]  But I just, I'm so sorry.
[716.52 --> 718.74]  I can't think of another word, but just like the zombies.
[719.46 --> 729.68]  You know, the kind of argument that you'll get from these zealots that will defend this multi-trillion dollar corporation to the death.
[729.68 --> 732.90]  Like, it's just, it's this bizarre dynamic that I don't understand.
[733.08 --> 736.24]  Like, having this kind of parasocial relationship with a logo.
[737.04 --> 741.50]  You know, the kind of arguments you'll get from them is, you know, I like the closed ecosystem.
[741.74 --> 742.96]  I like the walled garden.
[743.16 --> 751.76]  I like everything that's great about having a MacBook and an iPhone and AirPods and a Vision Pro
[751.76 --> 755.20]  and all the synergies that exist between all these products.
[755.30 --> 757.10]  You can have that and still not be locked down.
[757.10 --> 757.46]  Cool.
[758.00 --> 758.24]  Yeah.
[759.00 --> 761.90]  Then keep buying them all.
[762.16 --> 765.18]  I'm not asking for anything to change for you.
[765.28 --> 772.62]  I'm just asking for a way to update the firmware on the bloody product I bought without buying another product.
[772.62 --> 778.48]  And to not recognize the level of disrespect that that is.
[778.82 --> 787.00]  To basically say, yeah, you have to come to our store in order to update the firmware on this product.
[787.86 --> 790.00]  If you didn't buy enough of our products.
[790.16 --> 792.62]  I mean, imagine for a second.
[792.72 --> 793.78]  Imagine for a second.
[793.78 --> 797.34]  If to get a Windows update after you bought a Windows computer.
[797.90 --> 798.22]  Okay.
[798.28 --> 801.96]  You had to go to a Microsoft store and have them install it for you.
[803.10 --> 803.80]  Imagine it.
[803.80 --> 805.68]  That's the thing you got to do.
[806.04 --> 815.06]  In any case, whether we're talking Democrat versus Republican, PlayStation versus Xbox, Apple versus whatever.
[815.62 --> 818.36]  You've got to take whatever that thing is.
[818.62 --> 821.30]  And then you've got to pretend that someone you hate did it.
[822.30 --> 824.18]  And decide if it would be okay.
[824.40 --> 828.02]  And if it wouldn't be okay, then it's not okay.
[829.02 --> 829.96]  It really is that way.
[829.96 --> 831.08]  That's a good way to see it, actually.
[831.54 --> 831.68]  Yeah.
[831.68 --> 831.88]  Yeah.
[832.30 --> 833.28]  That's a good way to frame it.
[834.04 --> 834.72]  Continuing on.
[834.72 --> 840.62]  Many parallels are being drawn to the Microsoft antitrust case, which was like the last really major one of these they did.
[840.68 --> 841.56]  It's not the last one they did.
[841.70 --> 843.22]  It's the last super major one they did.
[843.90 --> 852.54]  Which involved years of arguments, rulings, appeals of those rulings, and eventually a settlement with Microsoft making a number of concessions.
[852.54 --> 864.12]  Riley also notes here that I, as in Riley, have also seen analysts claim both that the lawsuit is well-founded and poorly-founded.
[864.46 --> 867.18]  An eventual messy compromise seems likely.
[868.44 --> 869.44]  Which, yeah.
[869.68 --> 875.74]  I mean, you're going to have incredible amounts of money going into this from Apple and a bunch of money from the government.
[875.80 --> 876.64]  The government doesn't want to lose.
[877.04 --> 879.58]  So lots of money versus government not wanting to lose.
[880.28 --> 881.18]  It's going to take a while.
[881.18 --> 882.58]  It's going to be a big compromise.
[882.94 --> 901.98]  The way that I see this playing out is the government winning enough that it will be such a huge distraction and such a large sunk cost for Apple by the time this whole thing plays out that they will, at least if Microsoft is anything to go by,
[901.98 --> 911.80]  they will, for 20 years or so, chill the math out on the whole anti-competitive business practices thing.
[912.22 --> 917.76]  I mean, some of this stuff has just been so obvious for so long.
[918.20 --> 921.72]  I mean, look at the Epic Games versus Apple thing.
[922.46 --> 924.06]  I don't think that Epic...
[924.06 --> 925.76]  You don't have to like Tim Sweeney.
[925.98 --> 927.82]  You don't have to like Epic Games.
[927.82 --> 929.82]  I don't want Epic Games to go on my computers.
[930.50 --> 931.46]  And I have...
[931.46 --> 934.58]  I've gotten into it with Tim Sweeney in the past.
[934.68 --> 936.96]  I wouldn't say that he's my favorite person ever.
[937.70 --> 938.78]  But I...
[938.78 --> 945.88]  And I think that, you know, if we were to ignore the personal motivations for this from Tim Sweeney,
[945.96 --> 951.02]  where he obviously wants to make more money and grow his company, that would be ridiculous.
[951.24 --> 952.58]  We shouldn't ignore that either.
[952.58 --> 963.08]  But to disagree with his fundamental points that Apple and these other marketplace holders are engaging in anti-competitive behavior
[963.08 --> 969.92]  in order to lock in their enormous 30% take of every purchase that takes place on their platforms,
[970.64 --> 980.46]  to disagree with that, I feel like a demonstration that you don't really understand the behaviors that these companies are engaging in.
[980.46 --> 985.60]  And that you don't understand what anti-competitive means.
[986.28 --> 993.38]  Like, yes, it is fine to build a product that has benefits if you use it with first-parter.
[993.74 --> 996.12]  I mean, let's take our screwdriver, for example.
[996.62 --> 1000.28]  It works best with our first-party shorty bits.
[1000.28 --> 1006.02]  But there's a huge difference in designing the product so that it works.
[1006.34 --> 1009.20]  It fits 12 bits if you buy first-party ones.
[1009.76 --> 1014.20]  And so that it had, you know, an RFID chip in the bits.
[1014.34 --> 1018.36]  And the ratchet stopped functioning if you didn't buy our first-party bits.
[1018.56 --> 1023.66]  There's a huge, huge difference between designing products that work well together
[1023.66 --> 1032.06]  and designing products that punish users for not buying enough and for not playing by our rigid rules.
[1034.64 --> 1041.10]  Yeah, it's interesting because you often hear the 30% thing and it gets compared to Steam,
[1041.44 --> 1048.70]  which is intriguing because there's some stuff there that makes sense and there's some stuff there that doesn't.
[1048.70 --> 1054.48]  One is, like, if it's an in-game thing, it doesn't necessarily have to go through Steam.
[1054.56 --> 1057.28]  A lot of companies will do that because for DLC and stuff it's easier.
[1057.40 --> 1060.20]  But there are some in-game purchases that don't have to go through Steam.
[1060.62 --> 1066.80]  Also, there's a lot of things that Steam could do to be significantly more anti-competitive that they don't do.
[1067.90 --> 1068.94]  There's interesting stats.
[1069.06 --> 1070.22]  I'll come back to that in a moment.
[1070.30 --> 1073.42]  There's interesting stats that make it look like, oh, Steam is a little...
[1073.42 --> 1079.42]  Like, in 2018, a group of Valve staff tried to figure out just how efficient they were being
[1079.42 --> 1083.64]  and found that they were making more money per head than Apple, Facebook, etc.
[1083.74 --> 1085.10]  Nearly every tech giant out there.
[1085.32 --> 1088.62]  They found out that they were making, in 2018, right?
[1089.58 --> 1094.84]  $780,400 per employee at Valve of any level.
[1095.50 --> 1097.42]  And you compare that to Apple who makes roughly...
[1097.42 --> 1098.52]  And Valve's a money-treating machine.
[1098.52 --> 1100.54]  Oh, absolutely.
[1100.54 --> 1106.02]  You compare that to Apple who historically has incredible amounts of money in the bank and
[1106.02 --> 1107.48]  just rakes in cash.
[1107.58 --> 1108.66]  You compare that to Apple.
[1108.74 --> 1115.40]  Apple makes $476,160 per employee, which is like closer to half than anything else.
[1115.54 --> 1118.86]  So Valve is doing well at that 30%.
[1118.86 --> 1123.54]  But they allow you to sell your game on your own platform if you want.
[1123.88 --> 1126.14]  They allow you to sell your game on other platforms.
[1126.14 --> 1130.76]  They're not determining, oh, you have to sell your game at at least the same price as it
[1130.76 --> 1131.40]  is on here.
[1131.62 --> 1133.88]  Remember Humble Bundle when they were popping off back in the day?
[1134.14 --> 1138.60]  They were giving games out basically for free that you were activating on Steam and using
[1138.60 --> 1139.80]  Steam service to download.
[1139.96 --> 1141.54]  And Valve was just chill with that.
[1141.90 --> 1145.98]  They are not engaging in a lot of these other anti-competitive things.
[1146.28 --> 1147.54]  The 30% is a lot.
[1147.74 --> 1148.58]  We can talk about that.
[1148.62 --> 1153.46]  But that's honestly a different conversation when there's a bunch of different libraries
[1153.46 --> 1153.82]  on Steam.
[1153.82 --> 1159.54]  Steam even allows you to use games that you have installed from Steam in a different launcher.
[1160.04 --> 1161.70]  There's multiple other multi-launcher things.
[1161.80 --> 1165.54]  I think even Nvidia cards these days, you can launch games from their software as if anyone
[1165.54 --> 1166.34]  would want to do that.
[1167.24 --> 1168.62]  It's interesting.
[1168.96 --> 1171.56]  I have some issues with the 30%, but they're not as anti-competitive.
[1171.56 --> 1174.48]  There's a couple really good comments from people here.
[1176.16 --> 1181.38]  HockeyR says, I don't hear Linus complaining about Microsoft only letting you play Xbox games
[1181.38 --> 1182.16]  on the Xbox.
[1182.92 --> 1184.00]  Then you weren't listening.
[1184.00 --> 1192.02]  Because that was a major, major point for me for a long time was Microsoft's lip service
[1192.02 --> 1194.38]  that they were paying to gaming on Windows.
[1194.76 --> 1198.54]  You know, when they launched Vista, they had this My Games menu.
[1199.10 --> 1204.40]  And they kept talking about how much they cared about Windows gaming and the Windows gaming
[1204.40 --> 1204.94]  ecosystem.
[1204.94 --> 1213.10]  Man, in the Xbox 360 and even to an extent, the Xbox One days, I never shut up about how
[1213.10 --> 1219.70]  lip it made that we would get these releases, these crappy ports way down the line on PC
[1219.70 --> 1226.18]  and that Microsoft's Windows users were treated like second-class citizens when functionally
[1226.18 --> 1227.68]  the Xbox was just a computer.
[1227.68 --> 1230.50]  Guys, I never shut my mouth about that.
[1230.92 --> 1234.80]  The reason you don't hear me complaining about it now is that it's not a problem right now.
[1235.40 --> 1239.96]  Games Pass works on Windows and Xbox like nothing.
[1240.66 --> 1246.26]  Many, many games that you buy for the Xbox, I don't think it's all of them yet.
[1246.34 --> 1250.40]  I haven't looked into it recently, but I know that there was a big shift that took place about
[1250.40 --> 1254.26]  three years ago where many games would actually have a dual license.
[1254.50 --> 1256.80]  So you could play them on Windows or play them on Xbox.
[1256.80 --> 1261.88]  They added keyboard and mouse support to the Xbox so you can just play your games with
[1261.88 --> 1266.16]  a keyboard and mouse, which was a huge problem for me as a PC gamer.
[1266.28 --> 1268.56]  I would look at an Xbox version of a game and be like, oh, great.
[1268.60 --> 1272.46]  I get this in two years where I can use a proper set of peripherals with this shooter game.
[1272.98 --> 1276.20]  So a lot of the problems that I've had over the years have been addressed.
[1276.36 --> 1281.24]  That's why you don't really see me complaining about it anymore because, believe it or not,
[1281.26 --> 1282.38]  I am not just a hater.
[1282.80 --> 1285.30]  I don't complain about things for the sake of complaining about them.
[1285.30 --> 1287.44]  I complain about them when they're bad and when they're wrong.
[1288.28 --> 1291.74]  Then this is one from Jen's Woost over in Twitch chat.
[1292.38 --> 1297.08]  As an app developer and publisher, I find the 30% tax, both Apple and Google, by the way,
[1297.56 --> 1298.54]  no one questions that.
[1298.62 --> 1299.54]  Epic sued both of them.
[1299.96 --> 1303.64]  On one hand, I find it high, but I also get a lot of services for that.
[1303.64 --> 1307.14]  I get a complete store system, including invoicing, payments, management, etc.
[1307.28 --> 1311.38]  I also get a review process, which, yes, can be frustrating, but also ensures a quality threshold
[1311.38 --> 1312.48]  for the apps being published.
[1313.14 --> 1315.32]  Nobody has a problem with that.
[1315.58 --> 1320.00]  And I want to make this just crystal, crystal clear.
[1320.70 --> 1324.98]  Nobody, not me, not the DOJ, not Tim Sweeney.
[1325.58 --> 1327.50]  Nobody has a problem with that.
[1327.50 --> 1330.68]  The problem is not the 30% fee.
[1331.18 --> 1337.40]  The problem is not the complete solution with invoicing and all these tools and review
[1337.40 --> 1338.86]  and ensuring user safety.
[1339.50 --> 1340.82]  None of those are problems.
[1341.34 --> 1343.12]  The problem is the lock.
[1343.62 --> 1345.24]  The problem is the lock-in.
[1345.56 --> 1349.24]  The problem is that if I don't want your invoicing system,
[1349.54 --> 1352.16]  if I don't want your payment processing,
[1352.60 --> 1354.66]  I am forced out.
[1354.66 --> 1357.04]  That's the problem.
[1357.42 --> 1361.00]  The problem is that that review process so often...
[1361.00 --> 1364.14]  I mean, Luke, what is the percentage of times
[1364.14 --> 1369.50]  that we had our iOS app blocked over a user safety or user security issue?
[1370.94 --> 1371.70]  Quite a few.
[1371.78 --> 1373.00]  It's not happening as much anymore.
[1373.14 --> 1374.74]  Just to be super clear for people watching,
[1374.86 --> 1376.06]  this was a major thing.
[1376.56 --> 1378.36]  Like, probably a year and a half to two years ago,
[1378.38 --> 1379.94]  it was happening all the time.
[1380.16 --> 1381.68]  Like, every other time.
[1381.82 --> 1383.78]  And when it would happen, it might happen multiple times.
[1383.78 --> 1383.94]  Sorry, Luke.
[1384.66 --> 1387.04]  For user safety or security?
[1387.72 --> 1389.82]  Oh, I think never.
[1391.98 --> 1392.46]  Okay.
[1392.72 --> 1397.46]  How many times were we blocked for something that was not that?
[1398.08 --> 1398.92]  Very often.
[1399.28 --> 1399.46]  Yeah.
[1399.88 --> 1400.78]  My favorite one.
[1401.00 --> 1402.10]  This is a little bit off topic.
[1402.22 --> 1402.38]  Remember that time we were blocked?
[1403.00 --> 1403.28]  Yeah.
[1403.62 --> 1404.60]  You might even be going there.
[1404.92 --> 1406.82]  I'll let Luke tell the story because I'm laggy.
[1406.82 --> 1408.50]  Oh, the Netflix one.
[1408.56 --> 1409.66]  No, I was going to talk about...
[1409.66 --> 1413.48]  There was one time we got blocked because they said they couldn't log in.
[1413.98 --> 1418.12]  And then they sent us a screenshot of someone else's login portal
[1418.12 --> 1420.82]  while trying to input our information.
[1421.78 --> 1425.34]  There was another time where we got blocked because they said they couldn't log in.
[1425.34 --> 1427.72]  And then I looked at...
[1427.72 --> 1428.84]  It was our login portal.
[1428.92 --> 1432.96]  I looked at their login and they just typed it wrong.
[1433.58 --> 1434.34]  And I sent back.
[1434.38 --> 1435.86]  I was like, why are you typing anything?
[1436.22 --> 1438.48]  Like, why are you copy and pasting this?
[1438.50 --> 1439.16]  This is crazy.
[1439.16 --> 1441.16]  I don't know.
[1441.32 --> 1442.12]  The Netflix one.
[1442.20 --> 1442.46]  What was it?
[1443.08 --> 1444.56]  Netflix was doing something...
[1444.56 --> 1444.66]  Yeah.
[1444.72 --> 1446.30]  Where we set up our...
[1446.30 --> 1446.48]  Yeah.
[1446.60 --> 1450.06]  It was the first thing you see when you launched the app.
[1450.54 --> 1454.58]  It just directed people to create an account on our site or something like that.
[1454.82 --> 1455.00]  Yeah.
[1455.24 --> 1460.38]  And basically, our team assumed that what we were doing was fine because Netflix,
[1460.90 --> 1465.84]  for some reason, had a special arrangement with Apple where they were allowed to direct people
[1465.84 --> 1467.56]  to their own portal.
[1468.10 --> 1468.50]  Yeah.
[1469.16 --> 1470.52]  For subscriptions.
[1470.86 --> 1471.54]  And they did not.
[1471.64 --> 1477.14]  They outright did not allow people to subscribe through the app because Netflix's entire business
[1477.14 --> 1480.60]  model would be unsustainable if they gave Apple 30% of their gross.
[1481.18 --> 1487.52]  And so they had their sign up set up in such a way that you were just redirected to Netflix's
[1487.52 --> 1487.94]  I don't know that it still is, to be clear.
[1488.28 --> 1489.68]  And so we set up...
[1489.68 --> 1489.96]  Sorry?
[1490.64 --> 1491.76]  I was just speaking to the audience.
[1491.86 --> 1493.34]  I was saying, I don't know that it still is or not.
[1493.42 --> 1494.42]  This was a while ago.
[1495.46 --> 1495.64]  Yeah.
[1495.74 --> 1496.68]  This was a while back.
[1496.68 --> 1501.26]  So we set up thinking, okay, well, that's obviously okay because someone else is doing
[1501.26 --> 1501.48]  it.
[1501.48 --> 1507.08]  We set up our app to work exactly the same way because, believe it or not, our business
[1507.08 --> 1512.82]  model, being a video streaming platform for Floatplane, is equally not sustainable if we're
[1512.82 --> 1514.80]  giving 30% of our gross to Apple.
[1514.80 --> 1517.54]  We're not selling in-game cosmetics.
[1518.38 --> 1523.56]  We are not selling just button mashing games or whatever else.
[1523.72 --> 1527.66]  We have very significant costs associated with serving this video.
[1528.22 --> 1533.84]  And 30% of gross is not sustainable for us to the point where we will invest cycles into
[1533.84 --> 1537.46]  creating our own payment processing and our own subscription plan management and all of
[1537.46 --> 1539.00]  that stuff in order to make it sustainable.
[1539.00 --> 1543.98]  And so we set it up in the same way that Netflix was doing it and our app got rejected.
[1544.42 --> 1552.24]  And when we responded saying, this is exactly the same as Netflix, that was a long battle.
[1552.88 --> 1552.96]  Yeah.
[1553.36 --> 1555.38]  And right out the gate, they were like, yeah.
[1555.38 --> 1556.40]  I can't even remember.
[1556.52 --> 1556.86]  They did.
[1557.00 --> 1560.98]  They said that you can't compare yourself to any other app on the platform.
[1561.10 --> 1562.06]  It's not a valid argument.
[1562.78 --> 1565.54]  And I was like, this is one of the biggest apps on the platform.
[1565.76 --> 1567.60]  How is this possibly not a valid argument?
[1567.60 --> 1570.62]  You think people aren't going to build things based off what they see on your thing?
[1570.70 --> 1573.14]  And they were just like, you can't compare to any other app.
[1573.26 --> 1574.20]  This is what we're telling you.
[1574.24 --> 1575.22]  You have to listen to what we say.
[1575.34 --> 1576.80]  And it's like, okay.
[1576.98 --> 1580.92]  Because that was also really frustrating because I would complain back when we were having a
[1580.92 --> 1581.36]  lot of problems.
[1581.48 --> 1584.68]  I would complain about us getting blocked for X or Y or B reason.
[1585.00 --> 1588.16]  And people would message me and tweet at me and all this kind of stuff.
[1588.24 --> 1590.00]  Oh, well, my app got through with whatever.
[1590.12 --> 1593.00]  I'm like, yeah, that doesn't mean anything in my experience.
[1593.14 --> 1596.38]  There's no like, it's all completely individual.
[1596.38 --> 1597.68]  I'm having this problem.
[1597.80 --> 1599.66]  I'm now dealing with this person on Apple's side.
[1599.76 --> 1601.84]  And it just is what it is.
[1602.06 --> 1604.98]  There's, I can't make any arguments based on precedent.
[1605.44 --> 1606.78]  It's just super frustrating.
[1608.68 --> 1609.20]  Yeah.
[1609.58 --> 1612.12]  Which is how arguments work, by the way.
[1612.48 --> 1612.72]  Yeah.
[1612.84 --> 1614.14]  Precedent matters a lot.
[1615.42 --> 1615.94]  Yeah.
[1615.94 --> 1623.38]  Like, and again, you've got to come back to, would you be okay with it if someone that you hate did it?
[1623.38 --> 1629.18]  So if Microsoft were to say, oh yeah, you know, um, valve.
[1629.64 --> 1630.60]  Oh, oh, there's okay.
[1630.72 --> 1632.02]  Here, here's, here's a stupid thing.
[1632.32 --> 1632.60]  You know?
[1632.64 --> 1632.96]  Oh yeah.
[1633.06 --> 1639.32]  You know, valve is allowed to have a steam integrated enough into windows networking.
[1639.32 --> 1645.36]  So that when you switch to a wired connection, it'll automatically go faster and use that wired connection.
[1646.08 --> 1650.68]  But, um, you know, Uplay can't have, can't have that.
[1650.68 --> 1655.56]  So it'll just stay on Wi-Fi unless you manually disconnect your Wi-Fi and relaunch the app.
[1655.82 --> 1657.96]  And, um, yeah, too bad.
[1658.46 --> 1660.36]  It's different rules for different applications.
[1660.86 --> 1662.00]  You'd be furious.
[1662.00 --> 1665.56]  You'd, you'd be sitting there going, well, this is, this is ridiculous.
[1665.88 --> 1667.94]  It's ridiculous that they're gatekeeping this.
[1668.00 --> 1670.20]  And that's exactly the argument here.
[1670.26 --> 1675.26]  You just, you can't gatekeep functionality like that.
[1675.44 --> 1679.48]  Um, and for anyone who's going to sort of argue back at me, yes, you can.
[1679.56 --> 1680.14]  Apple did it.
[1680.26 --> 1682.08]  The answer is no, you can't.
[1682.08 --> 1688.32]  And the DOJ finally woke up from its 25 year slumber and figured it out.
[1688.32 --> 1691.98]  Um, at the time.
[1692.00 --> 1698.08]  At the time, back, back in 1998, you know, I was 12.
[1698.98 --> 1701.38]  So I didn't really understand.
[1701.82 --> 1709.60]  I, I used, I used Internet Explorer and I thought Internet Explorer was fine because I didn't know any better.
[1709.60 --> 1717.02]  I had, all I had ever touched was, uh, Netscape Navigator, which from my perception was a piece of garbage.
[1717.02 --> 1728.54]  Did I perceive it as a piece of garbage though, because of Microsoft's anti-competitive practices that effectively forced, removed all of their, all of their funding?
[1728.54 --> 1729.54]  Maybe.
[1729.54 --> 1729.56]  Maybe.
[1729.56 --> 1729.62]  Maybe.
[1729.62 --> 1729.66]  Maybe.
[1729.66 --> 1730.16]  Maybe.
[1730.16 --> 1740.24]  But as a, as a consumer, I didn't understand the impact that Microsoft's behavior was having on competing products and on their own product.
[1740.24 --> 1741.24]  Microsoft.
[1741.24 --> 1742.24]  All I saw was the convenience.
[1742.24 --> 1743.24]  Just so convenient.
[1743.24 --> 1746.32]  Windows comes with Internet Explorer.
[1746.32 --> 1748.22]  It's so natural.
[1748.22 --> 1749.62]  Of course, they're integrated.
[1749.62 --> 1751.62]  Because I was just, I was a kid.
[1751.62 --> 1752.62]  I didn't get it.
[1752.62 --> 1764.00]  Now, I am three times the age, which has some downsides, but, but definitely has some benefits.
[1764.00 --> 1770.06]  I have, I have the wisdom to look at what Microsoft did back then.
[1770.06 --> 1778.16]  I have the wisdom to look at what Apple is doing now and see the knock on effects of this.
[1778.16 --> 1785.66]  See the way that this kind of platform gatekeeping harms me, even if I don't understand it.
[1785.66 --> 1793.02]  And if you are, if you're a user who loves the Apple ecosystem, let me, let me try to attract
[1793.02 --> 1796.02]  you with honey instead of vinegar this time.
[1796.02 --> 1801.78]  Forcing Apple to compete harder is going to be good for you.
[1801.78 --> 1804.36]  You want a hungry Apple.
[1804.36 --> 1807.28]  You want a competitive Apple with bite.
[1807.28 --> 1818.52]  You don't want an Apple that is just going to sit and get fat and lazy and put billions of dollars into vanity projects that they ultimately cancel.
[1818.52 --> 1821.94]  You want an Apple that is trying to make the iPhone better.
[1821.94 --> 1832.94]  You want an Apple that recognizes like, oh, you know, there's a serious, there's a serious, you know, quality problem with, you know what?
[1832.94 --> 1834.94]  I'm just going to go after a lower hanging fruit.
[1834.94 --> 1844.94]  You know, oh, there's a, there's a small percentage of users who are still mad that you still can't move around your app icons on the home screen to your heart's content.
[1844.94 --> 1851.94]  That you have to create, you know, garbage folders wherever you, and make them invisible wherever you want to have an empty spot.
[1851.94 --> 1853.94]  We should deal with that.
[1853.94 --> 1854.94]  Let's get hungry.
[1854.94 --> 1855.94]  Let's fix problems.
[1855.94 --> 1862.94]  The fact that they took, what was it, three or four years to address those butterfly keyboards in their MacBooks.
[1862.94 --> 1864.94]  You don't want that Apple.
[1864.94 --> 1870.94]  You want the Apple that is, that is scared of losing market share.
[1870.94 --> 1871.94]  You want that drive.
[1871.94 --> 1872.94]  You want that drive.
[1872.94 --> 1873.94]  And you should know that.
[1873.94 --> 1874.94]  Yeah.
[1874.94 --> 1875.94]  Yeah.
[1875.94 --> 1876.94]  Yeah.
[1876.94 --> 1885.94]  You want the Apple that is going to lower the price of iCloud because they don't just get to stuff it down your throat.
[1885.94 --> 1889.94]  Because they're forced to allow other cloud providers like men.
[1889.94 --> 1899.94]  How awesome would it be if someone like a backblaze had the same level of API access and could have the same level of integration with iOS.
[1899.94 --> 1904.94]  All of a sudden you wouldn't have to pay for fricking iCloud.
[1904.94 --> 1907.94]  Backblaze is a perfectly good service.
[1907.94 --> 1922.94]  And if Apple was forced to allow it onto their platform, you would benefit because they would have to compete with iCloud instead of just, I mean, has the pricing of iCloud, when's the last time the pricing of iCloud changed?
[1922.94 --> 1923.94]  Nevermind the pricing.
[1923.94 --> 1926.94]  When's the minimum amount that they've provided?
[1926.94 --> 1928.94]  When's the last time that changed?
[1928.94 --> 1930.94]  Because it's like nothing.
[1930.94 --> 1934.94]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1934.94 --> 1939.94]  I know there's two interesting arguments to go along with this as well.
[1939.94 --> 1947.94]  I got both these from Theo, but one of them is that this is a shout out to us because it's bad for us.
[1947.94 --> 1951.94]  But I think he was talking about places like Twitch and stuff mostly at the time.
[1951.94 --> 1956.94]  But platforms that have a split with the creators on the platform.
[1956.94 --> 1958.94]  So Flowplane would be one of these.
[1958.94 --> 1960.94]  Twitch would be one of these.
[1960.94 --> 1962.94]  YouTube maybe.
[1962.94 --> 1966.94]  I don't think YouTube is largely operating this way, but it's going to impact them to a certain degree.
[1966.94 --> 1971.94]  Even Twitch, it's only part of their audience that this is going to impact, but it is to a certain degree.
[1971.94 --> 1976.94]  Any platform where you're splitting the income already, this is an additional split.
[1976.94 --> 1980.94]  And that's going to hurt those platforms disproportionately compared to other ones.
[1980.94 --> 1989.94]  Because like Flowplane, for instance, that's a much bigger chunk that comes out of the pie before we have to try to split it with our creators that are on the platform.
[1989.94 --> 1995.94]  So it splits and then it splits again, which is really, really rough for us.
[1995.94 --> 2000.94]  And then you have platforms that have probably, I don't know.
[2000.94 --> 2008.94]  The other argument floating around is that there's platforms that are like carrying the monetization of the app store.
[2008.94 --> 2011.94]  And there's platforms that are mostly just benefiting from it.
[2011.94 --> 2015.94]  Because there's platforms that are really big and very important.
[2015.94 --> 2018.94]  I think the example that Theo used was like banking apps.
[2018.94 --> 2023.94]  Banking apps are going to pay their Apple developer fee and then nothing.
[2023.94 --> 2032.94]  Despite being a huge requirement in the modern era for people to do banking with your bank at all is to have a banking app.
[2032.94 --> 2036.94]  So this would be something that they would pay a ton for, but they're paying nothing.
[2036.94 --> 2044.94]  So they're effectively getting subsidized by the Twitches, the float planes, the mobile apps with microtransactions in them.
[2044.94 --> 2052.94]  All the things that are actually flowing a lot of money through this 30% cut is effectively subsidizing these other, in a lot of cases, enormous companies.
[2052.94 --> 2057.94]  That just have to pay their developer fee or nothing if they're on the Google Play store.
[2057.94 --> 2063.94]  But it's both of those situations are like, this doesn't feel like right.
[2063.94 --> 2064.94]  This doesn't feel good.
[2064.94 --> 2066.94]  No, no.
[2066.94 --> 2070.94]  Oh, and there's no incentive for Apple to change it.
[2070.94 --> 2071.94]  No, no, I'm here.
[2071.94 --> 2075.94]  And there's no incentive for Apple to change any of that as long as they're making money.
[2075.94 --> 2076.94]  Yeah.
[2076.94 --> 2077.94]  Hand over fist, I might add.
[2077.94 --> 2078.94]  Yeah.
[2078.94 --> 2081.94]  And if they're, if they're not, if they are not,
[2081.94 --> 2089.94]  if they are not required to compete with anybody, if they're able to just sit and maintain the status quo as long as it's comfortable.
[2089.94 --> 2099.94]  And that's exactly what these kinds of antitrust cases are designed to combat is complacency and comfort to force them to compete hard.
[2099.94 --> 2106.94]  And everyone, absolutely everyone, unless you own a whole bunch of Apple stock should be rooting for that.
[2106.94 --> 2107.94]  And you know what?
[2107.94 --> 2111.94]  Even if you own a whole bunch of Apple stock, you should still be rooting for it.
[2111.94 --> 2117.94]  Did, did Microsoft get crippled by the 1998 antitrust?
[2117.94 --> 2123.94]  Was decoupling Windows and Internet Explorer actually, I'm talking now, long term.
[2123.94 --> 2126.94]  Because long term, they're doing great right now.
[2126.94 --> 2128.94]  They're crushing right now, to be honest.
[2128.94 --> 2130.94]  So I'm not an accountant.
[2130.94 --> 2131.94]  Okay.
[2131.94 --> 2142.94]  This is not financial advice, but pretty much anyone smart that you talk to who treats stocks like anything other than gambling is going to tell you, you are buying these for the long term.
[2142.94 --> 2149.94]  You're buying it because it's a company that you believe in, because it's a vision you believe in, it's something that you understand.
[2149.94 --> 2163.94]  That's how you're actually supposed to buy stocks, because you're supposed to be, instead of trying to time the market, you're supposed to be going for time in market, knowing that, you know, historically it has grown at X rate and whatever the case may be.
[2163.94 --> 2174.94]  So with that in mind, if you bought Microsoft long, are you a sad camper today because of that lawsuit?
[2174.94 --> 2175.94]  You're killing it.
[2175.94 --> 2180.94]  Especially if you actually bought it right when that lawsuit came in, you're probably doing super well.
[2180.94 --> 2184.94]  Because they had to fight.
[2184.94 --> 2187.94]  They had to actually try.
[2187.94 --> 2188.94]  And you know what?
[2188.94 --> 2190.94]  Have they learned anything in the long term?
[2190.94 --> 2191.94]  I think no.
[2191.94 --> 2199.94]  Their shenanigans with Edge these days, honestly, are probably worse than what they were doing with Internet Explorer back in the 90s.
[2199.94 --> 2213.94]  However, with that said, what I hope is that the DOJ wins an enormous settlement here and we see a bit of a return to good behavior because man, has Edge ever gotten annoying.
[2213.94 --> 2216.94]  I would love to see them go after Microsoft again.
[2216.94 --> 2233.94]  Honestly, I would just love to see the DOJ get 10x the staff and see them go after a whole bunch of the just clown show behavior that we've seen around right to repair, around anti-competitive practices, around walled garden ecosystems.
[2233.94 --> 2235.94]  I'm just so tired of it.
[2235.94 --> 2237.94]  And I'm tired of us accepting it.
[2237.94 --> 2239.94]  It's really frustrating.
[2239.94 --> 2240.94]  Yeah.
[2240.94 --> 2241.94]  Yeah.
[2241.94 --> 2242.94]  HP printers.
[2242.94 --> 2244.94]  Let's go.
[2244.94 --> 2245.94]  Man.
[2245.94 --> 2247.94]  I'm kind of wondering.
[2247.94 --> 2249.94]  I've been this bit on my radar for a little bit.
[2249.94 --> 2251.94]  I don't think they're in a spot right now for it to be a thing.
[2251.94 --> 2259.94]  But some of the actions that Microsoft has been taking towards AI stuff has me going like, are you guys releasing the beast again?
[2259.94 --> 2261.94]  Like, what's going on here?
[2261.94 --> 2264.94]  Are you guys trying to completely control the entire AI space or no?
[2264.94 --> 2269.94]  Because sometimes it's like it get a little close, but they haven't actually done it yet.
[2269.94 --> 2273.94]  But I wonder if this is going to feel like a shot across the bow.
[2273.94 --> 2274.94]  I don't know.
[2274.94 --> 2275.94]  We'll see.
[2275.94 --> 2276.94]  I hope so.
[2276.94 --> 2279.94]  I hope they're trying to make an example of them.
[2279.94 --> 2283.94]  The fact that it's so, so broad to me.
[2283.94 --> 2284.94]  Yeah.
[2284.94 --> 2285.94]  They're going after everything.
[2285.94 --> 2288.94]  I can see where people are coming from going like, oh, this is, it's messy.
[2288.94 --> 2296.94]  But the fact that it's so broad in my mind is more of an indication that they are going for damage here.
[2296.94 --> 2300.94]  So that I think they know they're not going to win everything.
[2300.94 --> 2301.94]  Yeah.
[2301.94 --> 2304.94]  But if they just are like some hurt, if they're coming in going, okay, I'm going to go.
[2304.94 --> 2305.94]  Okay.
[2305.94 --> 2306.94]  Full broadside.
[2306.94 --> 2309.94]  This is going to hurt.
[2309.94 --> 2317.94]  And even if it doesn't hurt that much in terms of the final settlement, this is going to be such a distraction.
[2317.94 --> 2319.94]  This is going to be so costly.
[2319.94 --> 2323.94]  It's just in terms of the opportunity cost, in terms of the time wasted.
[2323.94 --> 2329.94]  I think the message to Apple is play nice, or this is going to be an ongoing problem.
[2329.94 --> 2332.94]  You are going to be defending yourself on all fronts.
[2332.94 --> 2335.94]  And I just, I hope, I hope they stick to it.
[2335.94 --> 2336.94]  Yeah.
[2336.94 --> 2337.94]  Yeah.
[2337.94 --> 2338.94]  For sure.
[2338.94 --> 2339.94]  With that said, it's an election year.
[2339.94 --> 2340.94]  So who knows?
[2340.94 --> 2341.94]  Right?
[2341.94 --> 2342.94]  Yeah, that's true.
[2342.94 --> 2343.94]  I, um.
[2343.94 --> 2346.94]  Priorities change so fast in American politics these days.
[2346.94 --> 2351.94]  Well, yeah, you can't even just specify America there, but yeah, I agreed.
[2351.94 --> 2357.94]  Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's interesting because most people that I know of, cause yeah, like
[2357.94 --> 2358.94]  you were, you were 12 or whatever.
[2358.94 --> 2359.94]  I was like nine.
[2359.94 --> 2360.94]  I don't know.
[2360.94 --> 2364.94]  Um, when the Microsoft thing happened, most people talking to them about the, about what
[2364.94 --> 2365.94]  happened.
[2365.94 --> 2369.94]  Um, if you've talked to them about like how that felt back then and what they think about
[2369.94 --> 2371.94]  the ramifications of it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2371.94 --> 2376.94]  Most sentiment that I have seen is that they wish that this type of thing happened more often.
[2376.94 --> 2377.94]  What happened to more companies?
[2377.94 --> 2380.94]  They'll point at some company now that's doing something and be like, why aren't they
[2380.94 --> 2381.94]  going after them?
[2381.94 --> 2386.94]  So yeah, I think we should be happy that the people that if you're American, I guess are,
[2386.94 --> 2388.94]  you're, you're paying them to do their job.
[2388.94 --> 2390.94]  You should be happy, I guess, that they're doing their job.
[2390.94 --> 2394.94]  Um, and hopefully they, they keep doing that because this is bad.
[2394.94 --> 2397.94]  We can all wish they should do more of their job.
[2397.94 --> 2398.94]  A hundred percent.
[2398.94 --> 2399.94]  I'm with you.
[2399.94 --> 2401.94]  They should do more of their job.
[2401.94 --> 2402.94]  Yeah.
[2402.94 --> 2405.94]  But you know, let's take what we can get.
[2405.94 --> 2406.94]  Um, yeah, this is good.
[2406.94 --> 2407.94]  This is good.
[2407.94 --> 2409.94]  Like, yeah, I'm not American.
[2409.94 --> 2416.94]  And a lot of you are probably not American, but Apple being an American company is most vulnerable
[2416.94 --> 2419.94]  on American soil and.
[2419.94 --> 2420.94]  Apple's.
[2420.94 --> 2421.94]  Hmm.
[2421.94 --> 2424.94]  Is it their largest market or is it China now?
[2424.94 --> 2427.94]  But at least one of their biggest markets, it's either one or two.
[2427.94 --> 2428.94]  I can't remember.
[2428.94 --> 2434.94]  But this being Apple's biggest or second biggest market, um, anything that Apple has to do for
[2434.94 --> 2437.94]  their American customers is very likely to trickle down to everyone else.
[2437.94 --> 2440.94]  So it's a very, very good thing for everyone else.
[2440.94 --> 2441.94]  Um, yeah.
[2441.94 --> 2447.94]  Jeed or, uh, over on Twitch says the lawsuit reads like it was written by someone that was
[2447.94 --> 2448.94]  really tech illiterate.
[2448.94 --> 2452.94]  They blame Apple for the death of Windows phone and others instead of those companies making
[2452.94 --> 2453.94]  bad moves.
[2453.94 --> 2454.94]  And that's a really good point.
[2454.94 --> 2456.94]  Uh, I, I haven't read it.
[2456.94 --> 2458.94]  It's like 95 pages or however many pages it is.
[2458.94 --> 2462.94]  I haven't read it, but I've skimmed a little bit of it and I've looked at some highlights
[2462.94 --> 2467.94]  of it that people have been talking about on Reddit that really do emphasize what you're
[2467.94 --> 2468.94]  talking about.
[2468.94 --> 2469.94]  You're not wrong.
[2469.94 --> 2474.94]  There are definitely some areas where it could have been improved by bringing in someone
[2474.94 --> 2477.94]  who really understands tech and the history behind some of these things.
[2477.94 --> 2487.94]  But again, I, I get that government competence is not going to be as high as private sector competence.
[2487.94 --> 2491.94]  And I understand that the DOJ is going to lose a lot of this.
[2491.94 --> 2498.94]  Um, all I can hope for is that they win enough that we see a sizable enough settlement that
[2498.94 --> 2506.94]  Apple is sufficiently wrist slapped to change their behavior in at least a temp for at least
[2506.94 --> 2508.94]  some temporary amount of time.
[2508.94 --> 2513.94]  And that it causes every, the rest of the industry to kind of wake up and go, whoa, hold
[2513.94 --> 2514.94]  on a second.
[2514.94 --> 2515.94]  Like, okay.
[2515.94 --> 2516.94]  Okay.
[2516.94 --> 2520.94]  A great example of this was when the FCC went after that, that Xbox promotion where Twitch
[2520.94 --> 2524.94]  streamers weren't disclosing that they were paid to play games on Xbox.
[2524.94 --> 2527.94]  This was back around the launch of the Xbox one.
[2527.94 --> 2529.94]  It never got followed up.
[2529.94 --> 2534.94]  As far as I can tell, I don't think we saw, let alone a high profile case.
[2534.94 --> 2541.94]  I don't think we saw a single additional case going after this kind of undisclosed product
[2541.94 --> 2544.94]  sponsorship, um, and paid sponsorship.
[2544.94 --> 2549.94]  But what I will say is it brought about a significant shift.
[2549.94 --> 2552.94]  It didn't clean the industry up completely.
[2552.94 --> 2561.94]  There's still companies out there and there's still many, many, many influencers out there that are doing dirty deals, undisclosed deals.
[2561.94 --> 2567.94]  But compared to what it was before then, when it was complete, yee-haw, like just wild west.
[2567.94 --> 2576.94]  Um, I would say that it is markedly improved even now, even eight years later or whatever we're up to, eight or nine years later.
[2576.94 --> 2582.94]  So I, I, I am uncharacteristically optimistic.
[2582.94 --> 2585.94]  Is it naive? Maybe.
[2585.94 --> 2589.94]  But we saw a big change in Microsoft's behavior for a long time in 1998.
[2589.94 --> 2600.94]  We saw a big change in advertiser and influence behavior, at least temporarily, um, back when the FCC hit Microsoft for that Xbox promotion.
[2600.94 --> 2608.94]  And I would, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that we, uh, Avon Fox in Floatplane says it's now fashionable to say you disclose.
[2608.94 --> 2609.94]  Yeah, it is.
[2609.94 --> 2616.94]  And some people don't, some people say they disclose and they disclose sometimes.
[2616.94 --> 2622.94]  Some of that is an extremely major shift in viewer sentiment about creators monetizing their stuff.
[2622.94 --> 2630.94]  Extremely major. When we first started any form of monetization, no matter what you would get very significant hate.
[2630.94 --> 2634.94]  And like a lot of it from a lot of people, where people are really mad these days.
[2634.94 --> 2637.94]  If you don't monetize your stuff, people are like, what are you doing?
[2637.94 --> 2640.94]  You need to make money so you can do this as a career.
[2640.94 --> 2641.94]  You need to monetize your stuff.
[2641.94 --> 2643.94]  Play those ads on Twitch.
[2643.94 --> 2646.94]  Yeah. That's, that's like super common these days.
[2646.94 --> 2648.94]  It is completely flipped.
[2648.94 --> 2653.94]  So back in the day, disclosing that you had this, this is why doing stuff like that is bad.
[2653.94 --> 2659.94]  Disclosing that you had some type of agreement back in the day would have got you significant hate and potentially lost your viewers.
[2659.94 --> 2664.94]  And these days disclosing that you have it, people are going to cheer for you and hope that you do better.
[2664.94 --> 2666.94]  It has changed so much.
[2666.94 --> 2668.94]  It's actually wild.
[2668.94 --> 2669.94]  Yeah.
[2669.94 --> 2673.94]  Unless they don't like the company that you have the agreement with, but like in general, it's seen positively.
[2673.94 --> 2678.94]  Anyways, moving on topic two, speaking about phones, Windows phones, Apple phones, whatever.
[2678.94 --> 2679.94]  Minimal.
[2679.94 --> 2682.94]  It's like a Kindle, but it's a phone.
[2683.94 --> 2688.94]  Startup Minimal launched a crowdfunding campaign for what they're calling the Minimal phone earlier this month.
[2688.94 --> 2698.94]  While they haven't yet hit production, they have a working prototype for a smartphone with a three and a half inch monochrome e-ink screen and a physical keyboard.
[2698.94 --> 2701.94]  It has four gigs of Ram, 128 gigs of storage.
[2701.94 --> 2708.94]  The phone's OS is a custom version of Android 13 and the phone has app, Bluetooth and 5G support.
[2708.94 --> 2715.94]  Despite that, it's 15 Hertz e-ink screen makes it unsuitable for watching videos or playing games.
[2715.94 --> 2721.94]  The phone includes an eight megapixel front camera and a 16 megapixel main camera.
[2721.94 --> 2725.94]  Minimal is currently aiming for a $350 price tag.
[2725.94 --> 2728.94]  Actually quite interesting.
[2728.94 --> 2732.94]  Hey Luke, do you want to maybe show the people the phone real quick?
[2732.94 --> 2733.94]  Can I?
[2733.94 --> 2734.94]  Oh, you mean on my screen.
[2734.94 --> 2735.94]  I understand.
[2735.94 --> 2736.94]  I was like, wait, do I have one here?
[2736.94 --> 2738.94]  Yeah, I can't screen share this week.
[2738.94 --> 2739.94]  Loading up.
[2739.94 --> 2740.94]  Yeah, I got it.
[2740.94 --> 2741.94]  I got it.
[2741.94 --> 2742.94]  We're working on it.
[2742.94 --> 2743.94]  Here we go.
[2743.94 --> 2746.94]  Here's their Kickstarter or Indiegogo page, I guess, not Kickstarter.
[2746.94 --> 2750.94]  But yeah, big keyboard, very, very Blackberry vibes.
[2750.94 --> 2753.94]  This looks like some form of text messaging application.
[2753.94 --> 2755.94]  I'm not sure what one.
[2755.94 --> 2759.94]  And it looks like it would work fine for that.
[2759.94 --> 2763.94]  E-ink display, QWERTY keyboard, 300 PPI.
[2763.94 --> 2773.94]  I got to say, Luke, I think it's super cool, but I am not into the physical keyboard.
[2773.94 --> 2775.94]  I get why they're doing it.
[2775.94 --> 2786.94]  What I've found is that even on a device that has the horsepower to be responsive, typing on a non-responsive screen technology is a big problem.
[2786.94 --> 2787.94]  Yes.
[2787.94 --> 2791.94]  Because it takes so long to give you that visual confirmation.
[2791.94 --> 2795.94]  And I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't keep haptics on.
[2795.94 --> 2798.94]  So I don't get haptic feedback when I type.
[2798.94 --> 2799.94]  Oh, what the?
[2799.94 --> 2801.94]  I rely on the little...
[2801.94 --> 2802.94]  Yeah, I rely on the little...
[2802.94 --> 2805.94]  Well, what I find is they're on most devices too laggy.
[2805.94 --> 2810.94]  So it's a habit that I fell out of when I'm on phones every month.
[2810.94 --> 2816.94]  So on some of them, the haptic is so laggy and so sloppy that it was just yucky.
[2816.94 --> 2819.94]  So I would turn off my haptic and now I'm just used to it.
[2819.94 --> 2822.94]  So I kind of rely on the little popping up under my fingers.
[2822.94 --> 2830.94]  And I rely on my audio to be complete and really responsive to type quickly.
[2830.94 --> 2832.94]  We're losing them.
[2832.94 --> 2833.94]  I don't think Dan's here though.
[2833.94 --> 2838.94]  Your audio is getting really bad.
[2838.94 --> 2840.94]  And I think Dan left.
[2840.94 --> 2842.94]  So I don't think there's any fixes coming for it.
[2842.94 --> 2845.94]  We can hear you, but it's cutting out like half of every word basically.
[2845.94 --> 2846.94]  Oh, cool.
[2846.94 --> 2848.94]  Dan returned!
[2848.94 --> 2849.94]  Okay, well...
[2849.94 --> 2850.94]  With haste!
[2850.94 --> 2851.94]  Physical keyboard...
[2851.94 --> 2853.94]  Not too crazy.
[2853.94 --> 2856.94]  Not too into the physical keyboard.
[2856.94 --> 2859.94]  Their Indiegogo page, by the way, is saying 4G.
[2859.94 --> 2864.94]  So I'm not sure if the notes are wrong or if something's going on here.
[2864.94 --> 2869.94]  But yeah, the essential features here says 4G LTE.
[2869.94 --> 2870.94]  Um...
[2871.94 --> 2872.94]  I... yeah.
[2872.94 --> 2873.94]  I don't know.
[2873.94 --> 2877.94]  I haven't used a physical keyboard attached to a phone in so long that I don't know if I can really say.
[2877.94 --> 2880.94]  I feel like I would like it or at least be okay with it.
[2880.94 --> 2883.94]  But I wouldn't really know until I actually tried it.
[2883.94 --> 2884.94]  I do miss my brother.
[2884.94 --> 2885.94]  You hate it.
[2885.94 --> 2886.94]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2886.94 --> 2887.94]  I do very much...
[2887.94 --> 2888.94]  You miss it because you...
[2888.94 --> 2891.94]  Oh, I don't necessarily miss it.
[2891.94 --> 2893.94]  You remember how good it was...
[2894.94 --> 2895.94]  No, no, I'm talking to Dan.
[2895.94 --> 2896.94]  Oh.
[2896.94 --> 2897.94]  Actually, no, I changed my statement.
[2897.94 --> 2898.94]  You miss it because it was...
[2898.94 --> 2902.94]  I miss the BlackBerry's swipe navigation system.
[2902.94 --> 2903.94]  That is what I miss.
[2903.94 --> 2905.94]  I don't... yeah, the keyboard I don't care about.
[2907.94 --> 2908.94]  Sure.
[2908.94 --> 2909.94]  What are you saying, Linus?
[2909.94 --> 2910.94]  You miss it because what?
[2910.94 --> 2911.94]  Yeah.
[2911.94 --> 2916.94]  You miss the keyboard because it was so much better than not having a keyboard back then.
[2916.94 --> 2919.94]  It was so much better than T9 typing.
[2919.94 --> 2920.94]  Yeah.
[2920.94 --> 2925.94]  But I went back to it for a little bit for a short circuit video.
[2925.94 --> 2926.94]  And it's...
[2927.94 --> 2928.94]  It's...
[2928.94 --> 2933.94]  It's all sitting there going, it's fine as long as absolutely everything you want to type is alpha.
[2933.94 --> 2938.94]  And, you know, as a bit of an alpha myself, you know, I'm in the Manaverse.
[2938.94 --> 2942.94]  You know, I can't even...
[2942.94 --> 2943.94]  Man, what's...
[2943.94 --> 2945.94]  Can you think of a toxic Manaverse thing?
[2945.94 --> 2948.94]  I can't think of anything.
[2948.94 --> 2951.94]  You have red pills and your vitamins every day?
[2952.94 --> 2953.94]  I don't know.
[2953.94 --> 2954.94]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2954.94 --> 2955.94]  Well, that's good.
[2955.94 --> 2956.94]  That's good.
[2956.94 --> 2961.94]  How many Manaverse creators do you follow?
[2961.94 --> 2962.94]  Influencers?
[2962.94 --> 2965.94]  I don't think so.
[2965.94 --> 2966.94]  Trucks.
[2966.94 --> 2967.94]  Trucks.
[2967.94 --> 2968.94]  Trucks and guns.
[2968.94 --> 2973.94]  It shows up in my feed a lot because I like working out and chess.
[2973.94 --> 2974.94]  So YouTube is like...
[2974.94 --> 2975.94]  Oh, no.
[2975.94 --> 2977.94]  You like working out and you like chess?
[2977.94 --> 2978.94]  You must be into this stuff.
[2978.94 --> 2980.94]  But I'm like, get out of here.
[2980.94 --> 2981.94]  I don't want it.
[2981.94 --> 2982.94]  You're our demo.
[2982.94 --> 2983.94]  Yeah.
[2983.94 --> 2984.94]  Stop.
[2984.94 --> 2995.94]  Do you have any idea as a married late 30 something, how much promotion I get for like secret meets and like Ashley Madison and stuff?
[2995.94 --> 2996.94]  Oh, no.
[2996.94 --> 2997.94]  And I'm just like...
[2997.94 --> 2998.94]  Oh, no.
[2998.94 --> 2999.94]  How many times do I have to tell you?
[2999.94 --> 3000.94]  How many times do I have to tell you?
[3000.94 --> 3001.94]  How many times do I have to tell you?
[3001.94 --> 3002.94]  I'm not interested in this.
[3002.94 --> 3005.94]  Like not everyone who's married is abstinent.
[3005.94 --> 3010.94]  Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[3010.94 --> 3012.94]  I'm doing fine.
[3012.94 --> 3013.94]  I...
[3013.94 --> 3014.94]  You know, it's a good thing.
[3014.94 --> 3015.94]  It's not unfortunate.
[3015.94 --> 3016.94]  Wow.
[3016.94 --> 3018.94]  I'm telling you, Yvonne, you said that.
[3018.94 --> 3019.94]  That's not what I meant.
[3019.94 --> 3020.94]  The minimal phone.
[3020.94 --> 3021.94]  I don't know.
[3021.94 --> 3022.94]  I don't know if I'm necessarily into the keyboard or not.
[3022.94 --> 3023.94]  Sorry, we're fighting with latency.
[3023.94 --> 3036.94]  I don't know if I'm necessarily into the keyboard or not, but I am definitely interested in the concept.
[3036.94 --> 3042.94]  I think the $350 price tag might actually be pretty good, especially once you start being able to pick up the...
[3042.94 --> 3043.94]  Pick these up used.
[3043.94 --> 3052.94]  But I think that there is a fairly considerable war going on for like time and mind space.
[3052.94 --> 3055.94]  And I think people are starting to recognize and understand that.
[3055.94 --> 3061.94]  And I think tools like this could be very good because something that I've heard from...
[3061.94 --> 3062.94]  Did we lose Lannister?
[3062.94 --> 3063.94]  Is he just very still?
[3063.94 --> 3064.94]  I can't tell.
[3064.94 --> 3065.94]  He's very still.
[3065.94 --> 3066.94]  Okay.
[3066.94 --> 3071.94]  Something that I've heard because I've been encouraging people to turn on screen time limits on their phone.
[3071.94 --> 3079.94]  Because like I have like Instagram, for instance, my brother, my buddy, Darius and my girlfriend will send me Instagram things every once in a while.
[3079.94 --> 3082.94]  So I check their shared things on there.
[3082.94 --> 3090.94]  But I have it limited to like five minutes so that if I accidentally get stuck onto the homepage and start doom scrolling, it'll just shut it down for me.
[3090.94 --> 3095.94]  But something that's ridiculous about that is when it shuts it down for me, it'll go, you're out of time.
[3095.94 --> 3098.94]  Do you want to go to settings and give yourself more time?
[3098.94 --> 3099.94]  Like, are you kidding me?
[3099.94 --> 3100.94]  Yeah, I know.
[3100.94 --> 3101.94]  For me, that works.
[3101.94 --> 3103.94]  I won't go to settings.
[3103.94 --> 3105.94]  I'll leave it and I'll just close the app.
[3105.94 --> 3109.94]  Like, a lot of people have communicated to me the second that comes up, they're going to settings.
[3109.94 --> 3110.94]  They're increasing their time.
[3110.94 --> 3111.94]  It does nothing.
[3111.94 --> 3117.94]  So like it would be actually nice to be able to have something that you like can't necessarily do that with.
[3117.94 --> 3121.94]  Like, maybe Instagram does work on here, but it said it's not good enough for games.
[3121.94 --> 3123.94]  You want to put nanny on your phone.
[3123.94 --> 3124.94]  Like self-inflicted.
[3124.94 --> 3125.94]  Yeah, I want to be able to.
[3125.94 --> 3126.94]  Yeah, I want to be able to.
[3126.94 --> 3127.94]  You want nanny.
[3127.94 --> 3128.94]  Yeah, yeah.
[3128.94 --> 3130.94]  I want it to be harder to turn it off.
[3130.94 --> 3132.94]  Yeah, the fact that it's just like, you want five more minutes?
[3132.94 --> 3135.94]  Yeah, like that's the amount of, oh man.
[3135.94 --> 3137.94]  Something like that alarm clock.
[3137.94 --> 3144.94]  Remember that alarm clock that you had for a little bit that would jump up and run around the room and you had to go chase it in order to disable it?
[3144.94 --> 3145.94]  Yeah, until I booted it.
[3145.94 --> 3152.94]  Something like that, where you have to do some kind of cumbersome thing.
[3152.94 --> 3157.94]  And I think that I can definitely see where that could be a problem.
[3157.94 --> 3167.94]  Like that could be a problem if for some reason you were to set your phone app to be time limited and you needed to place an emergency call or something like that.
[3167.94 --> 3173.94]  Like I can see from a safety standpoint where there could be a situation where this is a problem.
[3173.94 --> 3182.94]  But I also think that for certain classes of apps, I agree with you 100% that there should be hardcore mode.
[3182.94 --> 3191.94]  There should be like, like you said, get your heart rate above 120 for 15 minutes and you can have your Instagram back for...
[3191.94 --> 3192.94]  I would love that.
[3192.94 --> 3195.94]  I would actually, I would prefer that over my five minute thing.
[3195.94 --> 3204.94]  Because then if I want it, if I'm like, yeah, I, oh man, it would be cool too if it only bought you a little bit more time.
[3204.94 --> 3206.94]  Okay, Luke, tell me this.
[3206.94 --> 3207.94]  I love this.
[3207.94 --> 3208.94]  Tell me this.
[3208.94 --> 3211.94]  Wait, wait, tell me this.
[3211.94 --> 3214.94]  Would you buy a product?
[3214.94 --> 3216.94]  Oh man, we are going way off.
[3216.94 --> 3217.94]  We are going way off topic here.
[3217.94 --> 3222.94]  Would you buy a product that was essentially a lockbox?
[3222.94 --> 3226.94]  Okay, a lockbox for your peripheral plugs.
[3226.94 --> 3231.94]  So you can't just like unplug them and plug something else in.
[3231.94 --> 3232.94]  Okay.
[3232.94 --> 3239.94]  And then what it is, is an inter, an inter, not like an interposer, like a pass through.
[3239.94 --> 3245.94]  Essentially, it's like a pass through dongle for your mouse board and game controller.
[3245.94 --> 3246.94]  Okay.
[3246.94 --> 3264.94]  And it has some kind of API integration with games so that you could actually do, you are forced to do that thing you tell yourself you're going to do, which is every time you hit a load screen, do 10 pushups or whatever.
[3264.94 --> 3267.94]  So it has like a webcam thing.
[3267.94 --> 3275.94]  And it's like, I am not, I am actually not going to give you back your keyboard mouth, drop down and give me 10 soldier.
[3275.94 --> 3280.94]  You know, like every time you're in a loading screen or whatever, like, would you pay for that product?
[3280.94 --> 3281.94]  A hundred percent.
[3281.94 --> 3282.94]  That's so sick.
[3282.94 --> 3288.94]  Actually, I wasn't sure where you were going with that for like a while, but I'm, I'm super into that because my thing is I will do it.
[3288.94 --> 3291.94]  I'll have like the willpower to do it, but I'll forget.
[3292.94 --> 3295.94]  It won't be that I'm like, oh, I just really don't want to.
[3295.94 --> 3298.94]  So I'm not going to, I'll just, you know, I'm playing a game.
[3298.94 --> 3300.94]  I'm, I'm more focused on like that.
[3300.94 --> 3302.94]  I'm really annoyed that that guy just killed me or whatever.
[3302.94 --> 3304.94]  And I, I forget this plan that I had.
[3304.94 --> 3307.94]  So I'll do it like a few times and then I'll, I'll forget.
[3307.94 --> 3320.94]  So if this thing is, uh, is, is going to jump in and be like, no, like you just died or you just, uh, hit a loading screen, like you said, or whatever else, like whatever event that you planned out happened.
[3320.94 --> 3322.94]  Now you have to go do that thing.
[3322.94 --> 3325.94]  Um, sit ups or pushups or, or whatever it is.
[3325.94 --> 3326.94]  That would be awesome.
[3326.94 --> 3327.94]  I think so sweet.
[3327.94 --> 3335.94]  I think everyone, everyone knows what's good for them and everyone has willpower sometimes.
[3335.94 --> 3340.94]  So the, the really critical, I don't want to, I don't know what to call it.
[3340.94 --> 3341.94]  Is it a peripheral?
[3341.94 --> 3343.94]  Is it a, is it a system?
[3343.94 --> 3362.94]  Yeah, whatever it is, the really integral element is locking down your system so that you can't just plug in another set of peripherals so that your peripherals are, are, are stuck connected through the translation dongle so that the removal of it is extremely inconvenient.
[3362.94 --> 3369.94]  So kind of like the, the app time limit where you can, uh, where you have to like do something in order to overcome it.
[3369.94 --> 3377.94]  There needs to be like a, like an accountability, buddy, you know, someone else to enter a password for you.
[3377.94 --> 3378.94]  Oh yeah.
[3378.94 --> 3379.94]  And it's one of those things where you could set it up.
[3379.94 --> 3383.94]  You could set it up one time while you've got the willpower.
[3383.94 --> 3384.94]  Right.
[3384.94 --> 3388.94]  But it's all about not, you know, not giving you an easy out.
[3388.94 --> 3395.94]  Like, obviously if you need to just use your computer and your arms are tired at some point, you've got a book report due.
[3395.94 --> 3396.94]  Right.
[3396.94 --> 3401.94]  Like, obviously that's a different situation and your accountability buddy, I'm sure would be happy to unlock your system for you.
[3401.94 --> 3402.94]  Accountability buddy.
[3402.94 --> 3403.94]  Accountability buddy.
[3403.94 --> 3408.94]  But in every other situation, if you're just gaming, Oh, I ripped it off South Park.
[3408.94 --> 3409.94]  That's not my word.
[3409.94 --> 3417.94]  Um, but if I, but, but if, if I'm just gaming or whatever, there should be no convenient way to keep going.
[3417.94 --> 3423.94]  And honestly, if the outcome is that you just kind of go screw it, I don't need to game that badly anymore.
[3423.94 --> 3424.94]  I'm gonna go touch grass.
[3424.94 --> 3425.94]  You know what?
[3425.94 --> 3429.94]  That's pretty good too.
[3429.94 --> 3432.94]  I don't see, I don't see a problem with that.
[3432.94 --> 3436.94]  Linus just came up with the next hot accessory for streamers.
[3436.94 --> 3441.94]  Honestly, a lot of the big streamers would be into it.
[3441.94 --> 3444.94]  And I think a lot of them super would.
[3444.94 --> 3445.94]  Oh yeah.
[3445.94 --> 3451.94]  Like based on the physique, I could definitely see like, man, some of those guys are shredded.
[3451.94 --> 3458.94]  I'm sitting here going, do you do anything but sit at your computer or sit in the gym?
[3458.94 --> 3460.94]  That sounds like a pretty good life.
[3460.94 --> 3462.94]  I don't see how you have time for anything else.
[3462.94 --> 3463.94]  I'm into that.
[3463.94 --> 3466.94]  That is, that is my goal most of the time to be completely honest.
[3466.94 --> 3468.94]  Lifting and clicking on heads.
[3468.94 --> 3470.94]  That's the life you want buddy.
[3470.94 --> 3471.94]  Yeah.
[3471.94 --> 3474.94]  Um, I'm trying to find mine.
[3474.94 --> 3475.94]  I always.
[3475.94 --> 3476.94]  Creatine and G fuel.
[3476.94 --> 3480.94]  I don't need no protein shake.
[3480.94 --> 3482.94]  I subsist on salt.
[3482.94 --> 3483.94]  Don't forget Soylent.
[3483.94 --> 3485.94]  Oh yeah, you gotta get that Soylent.
[3485.94 --> 3486.94]  Okay, yeah, here we go.
[3486.94 --> 3487.94]  I found it.
[3487.94 --> 3489.94]  So like my limits right now is I have five minutes on Instagram.
[3489.94 --> 3492.94]  I have five minutes on X.
[3492.94 --> 3495.94]  And I have 10 minutes on YouTube.
[3495.94 --> 3501.94]  And my thing is like, it might not sound super long for each one of those.
[3501.94 --> 3508.94]  So if you, if you combine that, that's a significant amount of time to just be staring at my screen.
[3508.94 --> 3518.94]  Like doing nothing of value to be completely honest, because if I'm watching YouTube on my phone, for example, I'm not going to be watching something of significant value.
[3518.94 --> 3523.94]  I'm going to be like, on the toilet watching a short or something.
[3523.94 --> 3526.94]  And then if that ends, I don't want to start doom scrolling.
[3526.94 --> 3527.94]  So like it.
[3527.94 --> 3528.94]  Yeah, it should lock it.
[3528.94 --> 3529.94]  And then it's over.
[3529.94 --> 3530.94]  And then that's fine.
[3530.94 --> 3538.94]  And my average, since I started doing this, my average screen time per day total has been steadily going down, which is good.
[3538.94 --> 3539.94]  I want that.
[3539.94 --> 3548.94]  I see them implement a per domain limit in Chrome, because I don't necessarily want to not be able to.
[3548.94 --> 3552.94]  But yeah, for example, I don't use the Reddit app.
[3552.94 --> 3564.94]  But if I, you know, if I'm just like, yeah, I don't want to be on on Reddit more than 10 minutes a day, I'd love to be able to set it so that that domain just won't, won't refresh anymore.
[3564.94 --> 3565.94]  That's really cool.
[3565.94 --> 3566.94]  I like that.
[3566.94 --> 3569.94]  I don't think that's a feature, but that's really cool.
[3569.94 --> 3571.94]  I do use the Reddit app.
[3571.94 --> 3574.94]  And I think I have mine locked down.
[3574.94 --> 3579.94]  It's just not showing because I haven't opened Reddit in a while, but I have a timer on that one, too.
[3579.94 --> 3582.94]  I just try to stay away from Reddit a little bit these days.
[3582.94 --> 3593.94]  But yeah, I've, I've any, anything that I'm like opening, if I notice, like, yeah, like my by an incredible amount, my most used app is YouTube music, which is fine.
[3593.94 --> 3601.94]  And then it's like teams and slack and stuff like it's that has, that has been a pretty big improvement like this.
[3601.94 --> 3602.94]  Let's see.
[3602.94 --> 3608.94]  Yeah, screen time YouTube music for two and a half hours.
[3608.94 --> 3609.94]  That doesn't actually seem believable.
[3609.94 --> 3612.94]  I bet you my screen was locked, but whatever.
[3612.94 --> 3615.94]  Maybe it got bumped and it was open or something.
[3615.94 --> 3619.94]  But yeah, screen time is going down, which is good.
[3619.94 --> 3625.94]  I think it's like, it's actually wild how negative is for you.
[3625.94 --> 3637.94]  So buying something like minimal phone or if some other product comes out similar to what Linus is talking about and using it to honestly better your life, I think is like super valuable.
[3637.94 --> 3638.94]  Just doom scrolling.
[3638.94 --> 3643.94]  It's like, there's a, there's a reason why using the web back in the day used to be called surfing the web.
[3643.94 --> 3647.94]  And why using the web these days is often referred to as doom scrolling.
[3647.94 --> 3650.94]  Like it used to be a bit different than it is now.
[3650.94 --> 3656.94]  And the thing that it is now is honestly very competitive for your brain space.
[3656.94 --> 3664.94]  And I think you should do active things in order to like wrangle control of your brain back because there's billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[3664.94 --> 3665.94]  Right now, right?
[3665.94 --> 3669.94]  Not necessarily, but I think you should be conscious about what you're doing.
[3669.94 --> 3671.94]  I mean, if you have a 10 limit limit on YouTube.
[3671.94 --> 3673.94]  Well, you could do it on your computer.
[3673.94 --> 3676.94]  A lot of it's like being on the phone.
[3676.94 --> 3678.94]  Yeah, that too.
[3678.94 --> 3679.94]  Done.
[3679.94 --> 3680.94]  Easy.
[3680.94 --> 3689.94]  A lot of it in my opinion is just literally specifically being on the phone because like, I mean the posture of it, what you end up physically doing, not very good, etc.
[3689.94 --> 3690.94]  But.
[3690.94 --> 3697.94]  Oh, I am, dude, I am so unhappy with like my typical like neck posture.
[3697.94 --> 3698.94]  Oh yeah.
[3698.94 --> 3704.94]  I am so unhappy with things where like I try to be aware of it a bit, but it's like it's hard.
[3704.94 --> 3705.94]  Try using your phone like this.
[3705.94 --> 3706.94]  Yeah.
[3706.94 --> 3707.94]  No one does this.
[3707.94 --> 3709.94]  No, nobody's doing this.
[3709.94 --> 3711.94]  Like you watch people walk out.
[3711.94 --> 3712.94]  No one's walking around like this.
[3712.94 --> 3715.94]  Like everyone's walking around down like this.
[3715.94 --> 3716.94]  It's bad.
[3716.94 --> 3717.94]  Yep.
[3717.94 --> 3718.94]  Not good.
[3718.94 --> 3719.94]  Okay.
[3719.94 --> 3721.94]  There's this whole thing about the rest of the show.
[3721.94 --> 3722.94]  I'll try.
[3722.94 --> 3724.94]  I'm loving how well this lines up right now.
[3724.94 --> 3725.94]  It is.
[3725.94 --> 3727.94]  It is pretty good.
[3727.94 --> 3734.94]  There's this whole thing about like, it's not necessarily so much posture itself, although posture might be more aesthetic.
[3734.94 --> 3740.94]  But if you think about the simple idea of weight being supported by bone, I think is exactly how it's said.
[3740.94 --> 3742.94]  Weight being supported by bone instead of weight being supported by muscle.
[3742.94 --> 3747.94]  If you're curled like this, your muscles trying to hold yourself together.
[3747.94 --> 3750.94]  And if you're straight up, your bone is just sitting on itself.
[3750.94 --> 3751.94]  It's way better for you.
[3751.94 --> 3753.94]  A lot better for you.
[3753.94 --> 3756.94]  There we go.
[3756.94 --> 3757.94]  Do you want to explain merch messages?
[3757.94 --> 3758.94]  I have to be exactly...
[3758.94 --> 3759.94]  I have to be exactly...
[3759.94 --> 3761.94]  Oh, right.
[3761.94 --> 3762.94]  Yes.
[3762.94 --> 3765.94]  Merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[3765.94 --> 3767.94]  Don't buy a Twitch bit.
[3767.94 --> 3768.94]  Don't buy a Super Chat.
[3768.94 --> 3772.94]  Merch messages are the way to go.
[3772.94 --> 3777.94]  All you got to do is head to LTTstore.com where we've got a few updates for you guys.
[3777.94 --> 3782.94]  And when you're in the cart, there'll be a little box anytime we're live and you can leave a merch message.
[3782.94 --> 3785.94]  It'll go to producer Dan, who I would normally...
[3785.94 --> 3787.94]  Hey, Luke's going to do it.
[3787.94 --> 3788.94]  No, he's not.
[3788.94 --> 3789.94]  What am I doing?
[3789.94 --> 3790.94]  I'm going to do it.
[3790.94 --> 3791.94]  I'm going to do it.
[3791.94 --> 3793.94]  It actually controls you.
[3793.94 --> 3794.94]  There's Linus.
[3794.94 --> 3795.94]  Wait for something.
[3795.94 --> 3796.94]  Oh, there we go.
[3796.94 --> 3797.94]  Yeah, okay.
[3797.94 --> 3798.94]  Whatever.
[3798.94 --> 3799.94]  Okay.
[3799.94 --> 3800.94]  Fine.
[3800.94 --> 3814.94]  Well, it'll go to producer Dan, who will curate your message for me and Luke to talk about, or reply to it himself, or just pop it up on the bottom of the screen so that you guys can see a little shout out for your mom or a proposal for your loved ones or whatever the case may be.
[3814.94 --> 3819.94]  We have actually had people propose on WAN Show before, which I think is pretty funny.
[3819.94 --> 3823.94]  Anyway, the point is, we will try our best to respond to your merch message in some way.
[3823.94 --> 3830.94]  Last week was an example of a week where we did not get to all of them because there was like a thousand or something.
[3830.94 --> 3840.94]  But the worst case scenario is you'll get some quality merchandise in the mail instead of just throwing money at a screen, which has always offended me a little bit.
[3840.94 --> 3846.94]  Nothing against the streamers who rely on that and the people who enjoy that kind of thing.
[3846.94 --> 3847.94]  Yeah.
[3847.94 --> 3848.94]  It's just not my jam.
[3848.94 --> 3854.94]  And I like that if you're going to spend money, you should definitely get some quality merchandise in return.
[3854.94 --> 3862.94]  So before we do a few merch messages to show you guys how it works, I have a couple of little merch updates for the store.
[3862.94 --> 3868.94]  Retro screwdriver is still running with free shipping for your entire order.
[3868.94 --> 3878.94]  We had a couple people ask us, yes, this temporary deal, which ends March 29th, is applicable to international orders.
[3878.94 --> 3883.94]  So if you haven't picked up a screwdriver yet, the time to do it is now.
[3883.94 --> 3885.94]  Pick up the retro screwdriver.
[3885.94 --> 3887.94]  Luke, do you want to pull that up on the screen?
[3887.94 --> 3888.94]  Yeah, sure.
[3888.94 --> 3890.94]  Pick up the retro colorway of the screwdriver.
[3890.94 --> 3894.94]  You will get free shipping on your entire order, that is, internationally.
[3894.94 --> 3897.94]  So, hey, do me a favor.
[3897.94 --> 3900.94]  Grab a few other things while you're at it.
[3900.94 --> 3910.94]  That would be great, because international shipping is pretty expensive, and this is a good time to just grab anything else that you want from the store, because, hey, free shipping.
[3910.94 --> 3913.94]  Might I recommend our new cable management arches?
[3913.94 --> 3918.94]  We've also got, what else is really cool and people are super into?
[3918.94 --> 3922.94]  TechSack is in stock right now and has really good reviews.
[3922.94 --> 3923.94]  Yeah, make that a kit.
[3923.94 --> 3926.94]  Man, dude, I wasn't sure, Luke.
[3926.94 --> 3927.94]  I love this gift.
[3927.94 --> 3928.94]  I wasn't sure.
[3928.94 --> 3936.94]  This was one of those products that I was like, do people want a cable management solution this badly?
[3936.94 --> 3937.94]  I don't know.
[3937.94 --> 3939.94]  Turns out the answer is yes.
[3939.94 --> 3940.94]  It just looks so good.
[3940.94 --> 3944.94]  These things are crushing it.
[3944.94 --> 3945.94]  Yeah.
[3945.94 --> 3946.94]  They're absolutely crushing it.
[3946.94 --> 3952.94]  It's just like every frustration that I've ever had is like, oh, I used zip ties this time.
[3952.94 --> 3953.94]  Now I need to go get zip.
[3953.94 --> 3954.94]  Forget it.
[3954.94 --> 3955.94]  I'm just not going to bother.
[3955.94 --> 3958.94]  I'm just going to go get this other or like the Velcro ties, you know, long live Velcro ties.
[3958.94 --> 3960.94]  They're great, but they're not perfect.
[3960.94 --> 3966.94]  They're such a, if you use them properly and really cinch them tight, they're such a pain in the butt to add something to magnetism, man.
[3966.94 --> 3967.94]  Magnets.
[3967.94 --> 3968.94]  They fix it.
[3968.94 --> 3969.94]  Oh, they work.
[3969.94 --> 3970.94]  I freaking love them.
[3970.94 --> 3977.94]  Well, is the one of the top up on the right now is someone using one of the arches to open a fresh door broken handle.
[3977.94 --> 3987.08]  a broken handle what if i can find that the magnets are super strong um i was trying to think
[3987.08 --> 3991.78]  what else is uh what else is great to pick up on the store man we launched so many products that i
[3991.78 --> 3997.88]  feel like some things end up kind of buried uh the dropout hoodie that i'm wearing that's a that's a
[3997.88 --> 4010.70]  really good one it's super comfy man gear um yeah oh the steve the steve is doing really well that uh
[4010.70 --> 4020.16]  that mock neck speaking of the show being largely about apple this week anyway yeah so ltdstore.com
[4020.16 --> 4026.00]  anyway dan do you want to show what a curated merch message looks like sure hold on we're looking at
[4026.00 --> 4032.10]  the the fridge door he just used the normal magnets now he's using ours nice nice well watch it again
[4032.10 --> 4037.18]  it's only 11 seconds so he's got a stack of magnets which then being in a stack can help two stacks
[4037.18 --> 4043.40]  two stacks oh i even notice yeah he's got two stacks and then just yeah one handle
[4043.40 --> 4047.86]  they also sell a bigger size if you want to be able to get more fingers in there
[4047.86 --> 4055.92]  all right anyways curated merch message that was uh that was unintentional i'm very
[4055.92 --> 4063.96]  sorry i'm not a very good shill not sorry i am sorry i'm blushing uh have you have always
[4063.96 --> 4071.66]  recommended dram ssds but unfortunately most ssds only have slc cache has your opinion on dramless
[4071.66 --> 4075.70]  ssds change much sometimes you guys use them in your builds like sabrent rockets
[4075.70 --> 4087.50]  so i it's one of those things where i feel like and you know what i don't have unfortunately i don't
[4087.50 --> 4094.22]  have uh i don't have a rational uh basis for this and sometimes things are sometimes things do be like
[4094.22 --> 4102.58]  that though um i feel like dramless is still the way that i would go if i could if i could afford the
[4102.58 --> 4109.50]  extra in a particular budget for my build and the reason for that is that it does put a little bit
[4109.50 --> 4116.26]  less stress on the nand in the long term is this going to be a problem within the reasonable
[4116.26 --> 4126.82]  life x life expectancy of an ssd probably not using using the the nand flash as an slc cache to
[4126.82 --> 4135.16]  accelerate the the drive or using system memory so so many ssds these days support using a little bit
[4135.16 --> 4143.64]  of system memory to um to make up for the function of a dedicated dram cache on your ssd and that
[4143.64 --> 4149.16]  aside from the small performance hit is not problematic at all uh relying on the nand itself
[4149.16 --> 4156.56]  to accelerate the ssd um can cause a little bit of extra wear even then is that going to be a problem
[4156.56 --> 4165.14]  in the long term um probably not you know i think that in the early days of ssds especially when we
[4165.14 --> 4171.74]  were still using slc or two-bit per cell mlc there was a lot of hand wringing and stress about how our
[4171.74 --> 4177.00]  ssds had a finite number of write cycles and they were only going to last for a little while and they
[4177.00 --> 4181.96]  basically had a had a countdown timer they had a ticking clock on them and and and we we stressed
[4181.96 --> 4186.14]  a lot about it and some of that was valid especially for like an enterprise application
[4186.14 --> 4190.80]  where these things are going to be overwritten you know multiple times per day but for the average
[4190.80 --> 4198.78]  user i mean think about it how how often are you actually overwriting that ssd and if it can support
[4198.78 --> 4205.70]  hundreds or in some cases thousands of cycles of being overwritten is that really ever going to be
[4205.70 --> 4216.34]  a problem um yeah so it's not rational but i would still i would still take a d ram cache ssd over
[4216.34 --> 4225.14]  uh over a d ramless ssd assuming that you know they're at the same price um i don't know that i would
[4225.14 --> 4232.88]  but with that said if i were to buy a system so let's say i picked up an rog ally or steam deck
[4232.88 --> 4240.72]  or a laptop and it had a d ramless ssd in it am i going to notice am i going to bother to replace it
[4240.72 --> 4247.80]  no and especially if i was picking up a game drive like a secondary game drive i don't know direct
[4247.80 --> 4253.72]  storage might matter at some point the first couple of games implemented it hasn't really mattered but
[4253.72 --> 4260.34]  for direct storage it might matter at some point um so for like a secondary game drive just my game
[4260.34 --> 4266.38]  dump um would i bother to get a d ram cache ssd absolutely not for that where i'm not going to
[4266.38 --> 4273.72]  have any data that matters and you know everything could just be replaced by downloading the games
[4273.72 --> 4280.08]  again from steam just get whatever the cheapest possible storage from a reasonably respected brand
[4280.08 --> 4286.94]  would be um in imgore in floatplane chat says them king spec ssds die quickly though
[4286.94 --> 4293.42]  i i mean that may be true that may not be true that may be anecdotal i don't i don't have any
[4293.42 --> 4299.38]  any trustworthy data on whether king spec ssds die quickly or not but if they do i would say it's
[4299.38 --> 4306.18]  probably less to do with the lack of d ram cache and probably more to do with the quality of the nand
[4306.18 --> 4314.22]  there's been some recent scandals particularly in usb thumb drives and sd cards around low quality
[4314.22 --> 4321.48]  nand flash from rando suppliers or in some cases used nand being used in these devices that has an
[4321.48 --> 4330.54]  extremely extremely short life cycle man i would love to see that product the the the ssd
[4330.54 --> 4340.24]  nand usb thumb drive you know like the the a grade nand chip thumb drive i'm not aware of anybody who
[4340.24 --> 4345.30]  sells that anymore premium thumb drives used to be a thing from the likes of you know brands like
[4345.30 --> 4351.94]  patriot or whatever else but i'm i'm not convinced that they exist anymore apparently they exist okay
[4351.94 --> 4357.04]  okay does anyone have an example who who makes who makes that these days
[4357.04 --> 4370.74]  uh build it yourself with an m.2 i mean yes that is what i do um apparently corsair has one
[4370.74 --> 4375.96]  sandisk and samsung have them but which one specifically guys because don't don't tell me
[4375.96 --> 4382.06]  that every samsung one is a good is good quality nand there's no way all right give me a specific
[4382.06 --> 4382.52]  model
[4382.52 --> 4388.86]  let's see samsung bar plus someone says
[4388.86 --> 4397.26]  i've never heard of a samsung bar plus me neither apparently neither have you you have no idea what
[4397.26 --> 4398.20]  you're talking about
[4398.20 --> 4404.28]  apparently the sandisk one terabyte extreme pro
[4404.28 --> 4408.60]  oh my god
[4408.60 --> 4414.34]  okay i have to go back to this is a thing unfortunately i can't screen share with you guys right now
[4414.34 --> 4417.80]  uh oh i couldn't find it
[4417.80 --> 4421.66]  i i brought up a bunch of samsung sound bars
[4421.66 --> 4427.44]  no i found bar pluses for sure how did you not find it maybe you're on that japan google
[4427.44 --> 4431.82]  i'm trying to find the right one and then i'm gonna screen share it right now
[4431.82 --> 4434.00]  yeah you can force yourself
[4434.00 --> 4435.60]  hold on can i screen share with you guys
[4435.60 --> 4442.16]  no i don't think so i got this though no sir samsung bar plus uh 3.1 flash drive 256 gigs
[4442.16 --> 4446.88]  speed in style move files in a flash rugged refinement
[4446.88 --> 4449.48]  i'm not seeing like
[4449.48 --> 4455.06]  oh look at that i uh i totally didn't even know that was a thing
[4455.06 --> 4458.84]  now how do i how do i make this make it big you need a different scene
[4458.84 --> 4459.44]  i'll make this quick
[4459.44 --> 4463.00]  well no no it's fine it's fine hold on no i'll just i'll just show you i'll just show you
[4463.00 --> 4468.22]  okay so everything you're looking at right here is a sponsored amazon result
[4468.22 --> 4472.40]  it's really small looking at right here
[4472.40 --> 4476.52]  oh you're highlighting i'm highlighting it i see i see i see everything you're looking at right here
[4476.52 --> 4478.56]  is a sponsored result
[4478.56 --> 4484.60]  everything you're looking at here is the same amazon result but not sponsored
[4484.60 --> 4490.22]  wow and then this is people also ask
[4490.22 --> 4493.86]  wow that is a
[4493.86 --> 4499.06]  old at 100 scaling and i believe this is a 1440p display
[4499.06 --> 4502.22]  unbelievable
[4502.22 --> 4507.64]  i have to go here
[4507.64 --> 4510.00]  to find oh wait
[4510.00 --> 4514.04]  is that this result no this is a different
[4514.04 --> 4516.80]  wd page this may be the actual result
[4516.80 --> 4520.46]  right under the fold so you can tell they totally knew
[4520.46 --> 4523.88]  they 100 knew what i actually wanted
[4523.88 --> 4528.32]  they just put it below the fold below all their sponsored crap
[4528.32 --> 4534.02]  anyway okay i'm gonna stop screen sharing now if i can figure out how to do that
[4534.02 --> 4538.50]  oh i'm screen sharing someone suggested that i use kagi i'd never heard of it
[4538.50 --> 4543.34]  apparently it's a premium uh like pay to access i think i'm not sure
[4543.34 --> 4547.08]  um okay this is a portable ssd
[4547.08 --> 4549.54]  this is not what i was
[4549.54 --> 4555.74]  this is not really a thumb drive i wanted something in that thumb drive form factor
[4555.74 --> 4559.62]  that is just using higher quality nand
[4559.62 --> 4561.00]  like an ssd
[4561.00 --> 4563.30]  the bar plus is that what the bar plus is
[4563.30 --> 4566.22]  it doesn't look very big okay i'm gonna try searching for it again
[4566.22 --> 4572.84]  oh my god karaoke i have 100% had normal flash drives that are
[4572.84 --> 4577.26]  that are physically bigger than this 100% multiple of them
[4577.26 --> 4580.92]  oh yeah this one this one looks fine okay so the bar plus
[4580.92 --> 4586.30]  is a trustworthy drive to store your valuable data okay so it looks like this is the one
[4586.30 --> 4587.48]  this is the thing i want
[4587.48 --> 4588.72]  yeah
[4588.72 --> 4591.44]  comes with a nice little lanyard thing on it
[4591.44 --> 4594.92]  boom that's a lot of time
[4596.22 --> 4607.30]  do they actually say like how many how many total rights it's rated at or are they just
[4607.30 --> 4609.98]  saying samsung makes a lot of nan flash and
[4609.98 --> 4612.34]  are experts in nan flash therefore you should trust it
[4612.34 --> 4618.04]  because i don't actually see anything that indicates exactly what nan chips are in this thing
[4618.04 --> 4619.78]  i'm not sure i can't find that either
[4619.78 --> 4624.02]  they just say it's fast
[4624.02 --> 4627.88]  uh and and the reviews for this thing are terrible
[4627.88 --> 4632.96]  are they they're most of samsung's own site
[4632.96 --> 4636.66]  the reviews are awful start start scrolling down
[4636.66 --> 4648.94]  yeah one and done stopped working after two months far from announced speeds poor write speeds
[4648.94 --> 4653.96]  protected registration fast read speeds poor write speeds only lasted seven months those are the
[4653.96 --> 4655.54]  first eight reviews when i scroll down
[4655.54 --> 4658.12]  oh you are on a different page than me
[4658.12 --> 4665.14]  mine is like overall 4.5 i'm on the canada page i guess
[4665.14 --> 4668.40]  my my top ones are
[4668.40 --> 4670.40]  yeah mine's 4.2 and has a lot of negative ones
[4670.40 --> 4677.50]  my top ones are uh impressive and stylish amazing high quality flash drive solid secure never fails
[4677.50 --> 4679.84]  future repeat customer here durability
[4679.84 --> 4691.96]  yeah i don't know i don't know man uh napalm uh in twitch chat in typical twitch manner
[4691.96 --> 4697.78]  has apparently put their life savings into intel thanks for the info guys i made it very clear that's
[4697.78 --> 4701.78]  not financial advice i don't want you to do that please don't do that no don't do thank you bye
[4701.78 --> 4706.68]  apparently the bar plus had some issues for a while with sizes below 128 gigs
[4706.68 --> 4710.90]  so those might be okay which makes sense
[4710.90 --> 4717.06]  or it might be that they're not using super super great quality nand
[4717.06 --> 4724.82]  and in lower capacities those low overall writes are revealing themselves a lot faster
[4724.82 --> 4730.08]  i want to i want to okay i'm gonna screen share for a sec i don't know how well you can see this linus but
[4730.08 --> 4733.74]  they show like you know the bar plus deployed in a few different scenarios
[4733.74 --> 4738.72]  it's on this guy's like wrist uh bead thingy like okay that looks pretty cool it's probably
[4738.72 --> 4742.74]  really annoying having it whack into your hand all the time and then okay it's just plugged into a
[4742.74 --> 4747.74]  laptop that's fine and then the weirdest spot to permanently have a flash drive really ever
[4747.74 --> 4753.80]  really just attached to the pull tab of the side pocket of your backpack have you seen the one
[4753.80 --> 4758.90]  that's in the back of a shovel you're telling me what you're telling me you want to see even dumber
[4758.90 --> 4761.40]  over-engineered pull tab on the ltt backpack
[4761.40 --> 4769.78]  pull tab is the flash drive yes yeah you see this do it carabiner yes flash drive in it
[4769.78 --> 4774.50]  carabiner and flash drive there we go are you listening to tinan tinan time to redesign tinan is
[4774.50 --> 4776.68]  screaming back to square one i can hear him
[4776.68 --> 4783.82]  and to be clear guys when i was talking about intel i was talking like very long term i was
[4783.82 --> 4791.10]  talking like multi-year outlook so please i none of it is financial advice i was just saying i i like
[4791.10 --> 4798.30]  i like their trajectory competing with tsmc and geopolitical tensions around tsmc and intel being a
[4798.30 --> 4803.88]  place to fab things like that that's that's all i was saying i was saying i like gelsinger's vision
[4803.88 --> 4810.16]  okay that's all i'm saying yeah you like this stock damn it you guys he just likes the stock there you
[4810.16 --> 4817.84]  go i just i just like the stock not financial advice for the cnn time yeah let's let's go
[4817.84 --> 4828.04]  maybe we should move on to uh some more topics how about that guys uh yeah wait
[4828.04 --> 4833.96]  uh we still need to do a merch message uh sure okay we can do another one
[4833.96 --> 4842.84]  hi dll and future me my question is what do you guys think about non-major brand gpus i've had an
[4842.84 --> 4848.68]  you know 3d 3090 for a year now with no issues but i heard it's not the case with chinese brands
[4848.68 --> 4862.44]  you know 3d is huge i forget who um yeah in inno 3d is pc partner um so inno 3d is a flippin
[4862.44 --> 4878.28]  enormous enormous aib uh so they own zotac uh inno vision or inno 3d um they own hold on uh consumer
[4878.28 --> 4890.20]  electronics um they're like a huge oem uh gaming here we go man they do digital signage logistics
[4890.20 --> 4895.08]  casino industry stuff yeah you you own a major brand gpu
[4899.56 --> 4899.80]  yeah
[4899.80 --> 4907.80]  good job yeah oh no new topic now
[4910.84 --> 4917.00]  sure we get to game at work everyone everyone on the planet gets to game at work now linkedin has
[4917.00 --> 4921.80]  confirmed that they will be introducing gaming features and that they are currently working on
[4921.80 --> 4928.52]  three games called queens inference and cross climb it's unclear if linkedin's parent company microsoft
[4928.52 --> 4933.80]  will be involved in any way other than owning the whole company but it appears that these games
[4933.80 --> 4942.76]  will be puzzle games like wordle or sudoku researcher nema auji uh says that the code for the new features
[4942.76 --> 4950.52]  contains a leaderboard that ranks companies by their employees in game scores according to a linkedin
[4950.52 --> 4955.96]  spokesperson the games are intended to unlock a bit of fun deepen relationships and hopefully spark the
[4955.96 --> 4963.64]  opportunity for conversations which means everyone gets to game at work now just kidding this sounds
[4963.64 --> 4967.00]  really dumb but that's okay
[4970.20 --> 4975.24]  why are you being such a hater i mean i can what do they do did they run out of things to make hold on
[4975.88 --> 4982.12]  did linkedin run out of things to make that that's my real question luke you understand that this whole
[4982.12 --> 4991.48]  thing was your idea right was it wow the problem that could make sense what did i say oh no oh no
[4991.48 --> 4994.52]  remember when you took one online
[4997.40 --> 5003.56]  okay so he cut out there but what he what he was saying was when you took one online 2014 yeah yeah
[5003.56 --> 5008.44]  sorry you're cutting out so i gotta infill the inform the people got you back now so oh he's back now
[5009.24 --> 5012.10]  just send it again one online course in gamification
[5012.12 --> 5022.68]  in 2014 i think it was or 2016 and you came back to work the next day all fired up about your ideas
[5022.68 --> 5030.52]  for turning basically everything on the ltt forum into some kind of gamified thing everything from
[5030.52 --> 5036.60]  interacting with posts to responding to them to updating freaking profile pictures was going to be
[5036.60 --> 5043.80]  gamified and if i recall correctly we actually put together we put together what was going to be like
[5043.80 --> 5052.04]  kind of a compelling plan to make it like a tech hub um like buy sell trade was going to be gamified in
[5052.04 --> 5059.08]  some way and there were going to be incentives for like participation and uh we were basically like
[5059.08 --> 5064.68]  yeah we could like turn it into like a social media platform essentially by making everything like
[5064.68 --> 5071.24]  gamified and it was it was actually a really cool idea and now you're just mad because linkedin got there
[5071.24 --> 5078.44]  first yeah well we realized that forums were horrendously dying and never coming back so um
[5079.64 --> 5083.48]  kind of pause that plan a little bit um but yeah i i don't know
[5083.48 --> 5090.68]  i i i guess they're taking gamification extremely literally here just going like all right let's just
[5090.68 --> 5099.08]  add an actual video game um which is kind of sick i i just i don't know it it it reeks of like they
[5099.08 --> 5105.80]  either ran out of things to do or they wanted to do some type of like uh fun hackathon thingy and and
[5105.80 --> 5110.52]  people ended up making games and they're like should we do something with this sure let's give it to the
[5110.52 --> 5119.56]  the people um i don't know it seems so odd i i can't imagine any company there's gonna be like
[5119.56 --> 5124.92]  one company out there that for some reason like cares about this a lot and like actually has like
[5124.92 --> 5129.88]  dedicated time for their people to like compete on these games there's gonna be one but that
[5129.88 --> 5134.76]  company's gonna be very silly i don't think so and there's gonna be no more i think there's just gonna
[5134.76 --> 5141.96]  be people who just want to play games and companies being kind of annoyed about this i love the idea
[5141.96 --> 5146.68]  that if you do play this at work your boss will probably be able to see that you did that
[5149.48 --> 5151.32]  and be like hey wait what speaking of
[5153.48 --> 5159.08]  we get into uh a big topic here sure well when
[5159.08 --> 5169.80]  glassdoor is not a hundred percent anonymous glassdoor has been snitching according to ars
[5169.80 --> 5176.04]  technica a software professional who emailed glassdoor customer support to request the removal of
[5176.04 --> 5182.52]  information from her decade-old account instead found that glassdoor took the name that she provided
[5182.52 --> 5190.44]  in that email and added it to her glassdoor profile without her permission they then repeatedly denied
[5190.44 --> 5196.04]  requests to remove her name from her profile insisting that no one else would see the information
[5196.84 --> 5203.16]  she then attempted to delete the account but found that this only deactivated the account and didn't
[5203.16 --> 5209.96]  remove the problematic information she finally requested a complete data erasure which deleted the glassdoor
[5209.96 --> 5216.12]  account but didn't delete the associated fishbowl account that glassdoor had created for her without
[5216.12 --> 5221.48]  her permission glassdoor acquired professional networking site fishbowl this is the first i'm
[5221.48 --> 5229.16]  hearing of it in 2021 and began integrating the two sites last july including automatically signing up
[5229.16 --> 5235.56]  glassdoor users for fishbowl accounts i don't think that's okay as fishbowl requires user verification
[5236.12 --> 5240.92]  glassdoor has begun requiring more information and has changed its terms of service to include language
[5240.92 --> 5249.56]  that says that they may update your profile with information we obtain from third parties some users
[5249.56 --> 5255.96]  have reported details like the name of their employer or home city being changed without permission or
[5255.96 --> 5262.52]  without a notification that new information was sometimes seriously inaccurate like a worker in california
[5262.52 --> 5270.36]  being listed as living in england glassdoor claims that they vigorously defend their users right to
[5270.36 --> 5277.96]  anonymous free speech in court so our discussion question is does insisting on collecting this
[5277.96 --> 5284.76]  information undermine glassdoor's mission and what is the risk of keeping it and i think these are fairly
[5284.76 --> 5292.12]  self-explanatory yes collecting this information does undermine glassdoor's mission can we improve and the risk of
[5292.12 --> 5301.00]  keeping it is potentially outing whether it's accidental or whether it's on purpose potentially outing
[5301.00 --> 5306.44]  anonymous whistleblowers that rely on platforms like glassdoor in order to speak out against their
[5306.44 --> 5312.28]  employee employers by the way you're coming through super we were able to understand all that but you are
[5312.28 --> 5319.08]  like very low quality roboting oh is it fixed now i will shut up for a bit no yeah you're you're roboting really
[5319.08 --> 5326.60]  heavy um yeah it's that's that's a really that's a rough one i i will warn people as well that if
[5326.60 --> 5331.40]  you're not at a really big company it can be pretty obvious who you are when you leave a glassdoor so
[5331.40 --> 5337.56]  just keep that in mind um but gla yeah the whole idea of this is that it's supposed to be super anonymous
[5338.20 --> 5344.28]  so this is pretty obviously pretty sketchy what's the risk of keeping it uh the risk of keeping it is
[5344.28 --> 5350.44]  really high because you risk retaliation from from the employer um and potentially depending on what
[5350.44 --> 5356.68]  you write you risk your higher ability uh because if a prospective company is able to find the glass
[5356.68 --> 5363.08]  door review that you're leaving and it's like really really emotionally charged or something like that
[5363.08 --> 5369.64]  it could potentially hurt your higher ability which uh well as is so often the case the risk is not the
[5369.64 --> 5375.24]  glass door though nothing will happen to them yep the risk is just to their users that had no say in
[5375.24 --> 5382.84]  any of this which is extremely frustrating yeah definitely absolutely uh something that isn't super
[5382.84 --> 5389.00]  frustrating is steam families launching in beta valve has launched steam families on the steam beta client
[5389.00 --> 5396.68]  uh which is in quote we should do sponsors the card is not there we listen to the cards we should do

[5574.84 --> 5580.84]  and last the apos white fox eclipse we worked with apos to release the set of ltt keycaps announced
[5580.84 --> 5588.04]  early where you can hit the banana key whenever you desire or the boxers key or the screwdriver key
[5588.04 --> 5594.28]  uh yeah it's uh it's pretty great um don't worry if bananas are not your thing they also want you
[5594.28 --> 5600.68]  guys to to meet their white fox eclipse keyboard very clean very good looking show keyboard okay hold on

[5609.88 --> 5617.08]  think is pretty cool is you can just take that off wow easy serviceability now you can get those keycaps
[5617.08 --> 5622.28]  clean them all nicely and easily without screws all that type of stuff i'll show the other one off real
[5622.28 --> 5631.32]  quick here's the ltt one so you can see it's color themed including part of the back plate which is pretty
[5631.32 --> 5637.48]  sweet you've got your screwdriver button your banana button there's like a widget thing here there's boxers
[5637.48 --> 5643.64]  including a little bit of a bulge it looks great feels great good switches it's a normal sized bulge
[5646.12 --> 5652.60]  okay uh this 68 key mechanical keyboard has the standard hot swappable switches and universal keycap
[5652.60 --> 5659.08]  compatibility which is nice but what makes it special is its carefully crafted parts such as a flexible pcb
[5659.08 --> 5666.92]  uh with pour on switch foam and vibration isolating edge gaskets uh it can be used wired or wirelessly
[5666.92 --> 5672.12]  via bluetooth and is designed to sound and look great it sounds amazing it sounds very good i don't
[5672.12 --> 5673.96]  know if this will come through should i put out to mike yep
[5673.96 --> 5686.52]  oh that space bar is nice very nice yeah i had to include the space bar um they have a few
[5686.52 --> 5691.88]  configurations like a high body cnc which we have here so that's the ones that you've seen as well as
[5691.88 --> 5699.08]  a low body cnc and a standard plastic body version so check it out using the link below and use code lmg
[5699.08 --> 5705.08]  eclipse for 10 off your purchase and if you bundle the keyboard uh if you bundle the keyboard up with
[5705.08 --> 5710.12]  the ltt keycaps you can save even more and that link will be down there as well
[5714.12 --> 5718.92]  cool sorry that was a lot all at the same time working on that for you linus
[5725.00 --> 5725.64]  working on what
[5725.64 --> 5735.48]  oh i can't do that for you because i don't have access to that at all i don't think i can hear him
[5735.48 --> 5741.32]  by the way uh you should be able to hear him oh there we go everything's fine i love it you might
[5741.32 --> 5749.96]  have to ask your jive nice thanks oh no uh that is not easy right now luke will have to do it for you
[5749.96 --> 5753.96]  then i don't have access to any of those i i couldn't hear him what's happening oh he was just he was
[5753.96 --> 5763.96]  texting me oh i can't access the um merch messages dashboard because my work account doesn't have
[5763.96 --> 5770.20]  access for some reason that is because of luke that um i think that's a von's fault and so now
[5770.20 --> 5776.68]  the workaround is i have to lock in i have to log into some account that i don't have the 2fa for
[5776.68 --> 5784.04]  to get access to a code for another account that in order to get its 2fa in order to yeah so you can
[5784.04 --> 5792.60]  see where this is going i can't access the dashboard do you need it i mean it would be it'd be nice to
[5792.60 --> 5800.28]  be able to access the you don't need it also you could have prepared oh my god i don't think this is my
[5800.28 --> 5812.28]  fault just because we have security features have access i don't think so yeah well okay actually your
[5812.28 --> 5816.28]  work account is supposed to have access i think it does i think you're wrong
[5819.48 --> 5824.12]  i think you're wrong he says use microsoft not google use microsoft
[5824.12 --> 5831.64]  oh what are you using google why can't i use like yeah because if you paid attention to monday
[5831.64 --> 5836.60]  morning meetings we migrated single sign-on he's never in monday morning everybody he's
[5836.60 --> 5840.28]  come to about as many emails he should know he's come to about as many as you have luke
[5842.84 --> 5848.52]  bottom i have i have my own monday morning meetings okay yeah well where's our email blast for your monday
[5848.52 --> 5852.12]  morning meetings you don't need to know i want to know what you're doing with your full stack systems
[5852.12 --> 5858.04]  how is kubernetes going i don't know well i'm i'm doing a state of the union next monday so you'll
[5858.04 --> 5864.84]  you'll find out some stuff then um apparently the anniversary of the hack right now yeah that's kind
[5864.84 --> 5870.44]  of cool is it really i wish we were back there again has it been here i wish we were doing it again
[5870.44 --> 5876.92]  dude i'm working tomorrow i could just stay here all night i'm down i could work out and click on heads
[5876.92 --> 5886.04]  i want i want this life that's all i need to be a happy boy that's all i need if it's like oh i'm
[5886.04 --> 5890.92]  sad it's like hmm what have i not done in a while is it either working out or is it clicking on heads
[5890.92 --> 5894.92]  there's probably one of them and if i do that thing i'll probably no longer be sad anymore
[5894.92 --> 5897.08]  that's usually how it works mm-hmm yep
[5897.08 --> 5906.20]  i've lost linus yeah he's gone i can do another topic no no i'm here he's not gone uh
[5907.16 --> 5910.92]  he's trying to get to a for his microsoft account now that's what i bet you that's what he's doing
[5913.00 --> 5913.24]  yep
[5915.88 --> 5916.76]  request denied
[5916.76 --> 5924.92]  oh
[5928.68 --> 5933.16]  the microsoft one is so annoying it it does that so often i'll just be like no
[5934.92 --> 5939.24]  no you're not allowed you have to type in a number and then you have to also biometrically
[5940.20 --> 5943.88]  authenticate with your phone it's like what how many times do you have
[5943.88 --> 5949.24]  and then you have to like to be able to access the microsoft authenticator app you have to
[5949.24 --> 5953.80]  biometrically authenticate and then to be able to approve the login request you have to biometrically
[5953.80 --> 5960.60]  authenticate again it's like bro come on this is why i just keep everything on post-it notes
[5962.68 --> 5964.20]  it says it doesn't have access
[5966.28 --> 5968.36]  okay my bad we can fix that
[5968.36 --> 5980.12]  i hate you all i don't like being a real company can we just go back to having one shared microsoft
[5980.12 --> 5985.40]  account we would probably save money as well just have all the usernames and passwords in a sheet in
[5985.40 --> 5992.20]  a google sheet again no we would need we would need to log into google to to like get access to that
[5992.20 --> 5996.44]  i gotta i gotta send a message so i remember to do this next week
[5998.68 --> 6003.80]  oh my god okay dan what are we supposed to be doing right now aren't we supposed to be doing merch messages
[6003.80 --> 6007.32]  i guess i guess i don't even know anymore
[6007.32 --> 6014.76]  okay uh sure no no we're supposed to do topics we finished merch messages and then i was going to
[6014.76 --> 6019.00]  do another topic and we went into sponsors yeah and then after sponsors we do three more
[6019.00 --> 6023.64]  merch messages we're back i was doing three things at once during that sponsor segment so
[6023.64 --> 6029.40]  sorry i didn't put the card up uh hi dll during the gpu pandemic did you hear anything about how
[6029.40 --> 6031.96]  sales of peripherals were affected
[6036.84 --> 6042.52]  probably they went up a lot that would be my guess i mean almost anything related to computers and
[6042.52 --> 6050.52]  technology went up a lot during the pandemic and then went down yeah high bearded tech guy one bearded
[6050.52 --> 6057.96]  tech guy two and oh has the preliminary data from the lab influenced any personal purchases from any of
[6057.96 --> 6061.72]  y'all yet either steering towards or away from a product
[6065.64 --> 6070.84]  not gonna lie i was reading full point i didn't hear that uh the labs see this is why i need access to
[6070.84 --> 6080.04]  the dashboard so there's a galaxy s7 somewhere that i need a code from oh i can i can do that for you
[6081.48 --> 6093.72]  oh my gosh uh hi has the labs made you buy a product yet because you saw good things from uh the that
[6093.72 --> 6100.12]  no not for me personally but i guarantee you that it will eventually do i have to tap it'll happen
[6100.68 --> 6109.08]  it resulted in me getting a product kind of the processor in my most recent build oh oh boy oh yeah
[6109.08 --> 6117.16]  yeah 7800x3d the you got the worst of the best yeah and then and then got a better one it was dead
[6117.88 --> 6124.60]  nice yeah that worked right oh aj says i should have access now oh hey nice
[6124.60 --> 6130.68]  brought to you by me on a random train in japan wait you guys are in the same country
[6132.68 --> 6137.48]  i didn't really put this together until now aj linus is in japan no way
[6137.48 --> 6145.16]  that's hilarious that's hilarious that is hilarious i hope you're enjoying your trip
[6146.12 --> 6149.96]  aj and linus i mean we're both working apparently so
[6151.48 --> 6158.12]  yeah victory for me dude oh so good could have some meetings oh man that's really funny
[6158.12 --> 6164.92]  that's actually kind of interesting uh like everyone i know is going to japan right now dude
[6167.48 --> 6171.64]  yeah i was i was talking to someone about this i showed the dashboard for a second and now it's
[6171.64 --> 6177.96]  prompting me for a password yeah well it loads without the like the hooks or whatever so no data
[6177.96 --> 6182.68]  is actually going to flow through the one that you see for a second it's just the just the front end
[6182.68 --> 6191.08]  um i don't like technology uh i had something to say oh yeah japan was one of those countries that
[6191.08 --> 6198.60]  stayed closed for a really long time um so people that had wanted to go visit there are kind of all
[6199.16 --> 6202.12]  you know they had to wait for a pretty significant amount of time so people are kind of rushing in right
[6202.12 --> 6211.40]  now i think that's what's going um they also yeah there's also a super like budget airline zip air
[6211.40 --> 6216.92]  that just opened up service direct service from vancouver to japan uh we have a friend that paid
[6216.92 --> 6224.12]  like 700 each for direct flights and like yeah sure it's economy or whatever but like honestly that's
[6224.12 --> 6230.28]  i would rather sit in economy on a on a newly retrofitted plane than sit in business class on an
[6230.28 --> 6237.32]  old plane like they have these little trays that fit your phone and it's just like oh this is great
[6237.32 --> 6242.44]  this is they have no on built-in entertainment system but they have somewhere for me to put the
[6242.44 --> 6248.68]  one i brought with me yeah which is perfect and exactly what i wanted anyway uh so i set up my kids
[6248.68 --> 6254.12]  with a switch sitting in there and all three of them side by side and they just like were able to play
[6254.12 --> 6260.68]  switch games uh so yeah they had a pretty good flight honestly um i would love it if the screens on
[6260.68 --> 6265.72]  planes just had an htmi in and you could just use um
[6267.32 --> 6270.68]  the other one i would love it if you could use the camera to put the camera on the screen
[6270.68 --> 6276.92]  did aj just guess correctly i got it okay okay sec um okay
[6278.60 --> 6282.76]  a more i i want to talk about you being in japan but we should do more merch messages
[6283.48 --> 6289.56]  sure we should keep that rolling uh a long while back there was a frequent string of shows where either
[6289.56 --> 6296.68]  one of you both couldn't make it since then you've been in you've been on a zero miss streak was it an
[6296.68 --> 6299.16]  attempt to test the waters on many hosts
[6301.64 --> 6311.00]  no it was um basically us kind of accepting that we couldn't make it to the show sometimes and being
[6311.00 --> 6317.88]  totally fine with someone else hosting it and then we were totally both able to make it to the show for a
[6317.88 --> 6322.76]  very very very long time because of various lockdown related reasons we weren't going anywhere we
[6322.76 --> 6328.60]  weren't doing anything so we were always on wan show and then it's just become a meaningless dick
[6328.60 --> 6334.52]  measuring competition to see who can keep the street going the longest and if there's one thing that
[6335.64 --> 6343.40]  neither luke nor i will accept it's that um one of us definitely has a bigger dick it isn't me and um
[6343.40 --> 6353.64]  uh i'll never admit it oh because that means i'm here to keep both of you honest because there's now
[6353.64 --> 6362.12]  no excuse for the wan show to not happen yeah so through through various sicknesses and various
[6362.12 --> 6367.32]  vacations and various time zones and etc we've just always somehow made it work
[6367.32 --> 6376.04]  yep yep and i and now that we've both made it work um there's just like neither of us is going to back
[6376.04 --> 6382.36]  down no matter no matter how much we both know the answer i i've had i've had the like theory craft of
[6382.36 --> 6387.72]  like if i end up in the hospital can i convince them to like give me a laptop with a webcam so i can do
[6387.72 --> 6395.72]  which i i have actually thought about that like okay so linus is in the hospital is it gauche to make him do the
[6395.72 --> 6401.64]  the wan show still uh like who would who would have power who would have power of attorney
[6404.84 --> 6410.20]  all right you want okay oh you know what she'll enable this behavior could he bond appear in my
[6410.20 --> 6418.20]  stead does it does that work no does it work like that no no i think yvonne is me legally no no no no
[6418.68 --> 6424.52]  if she had power of attorney to let me point a camera at you if you were unconscious then that's okay
[6424.52 --> 6431.48]  uh but you i think that's fair that's what i'm asking basically that's what i'm asking yeah so if
[6432.28 --> 6439.64]  if she talks and i just am and i'm just your unconscious body yeah that's fair i have i have
[6439.64 --> 6445.56]  planned for these contingencies i think that counts yep okay i think that counts good i think that counts
[6445.56 --> 6452.44]  excellent yeah and honestly if if all three of us agree then it it just does i think minus would be
[6452.44 --> 6457.32]  more upset if he missed wanshow while he was unconscious yeah honestly me too yeah honestly
[6457.32 --> 6464.04]  i'd wake up i'd wake up extremely angry yeah yes like what do you mean you can find a way back down
[6464.04 --> 6475.80]  i lost to luke it's over it's done take me out coach coma show oh man oh man if the show starts
[6475.80 --> 6482.44]  too late it ends up like that honestly i think we're pretty good at keeping energy up not always i guess
[6483.00 --> 6489.72]  uh let's see yeah do you want any more if we have more i think sure as a physician we take patient
[6489.72 --> 6496.60]  privacy seriously we can lose our jobs or be fined if patient identifiers leak what would you say is
[6496.60 --> 6504.20]  an appropriate fine for companies having customer data stolen oh yeah this one's really rough because like
[6507.24 --> 6508.20]  oh man
[6511.80 --> 6519.64]  what constitutes customer data and like now you're kind of weaponizing like if if you have a competitor
[6520.36 --> 6526.12]  now you have a weapon of either putting a bounty on them or trying to do it yourself like
[6526.68 --> 6531.96]  breaking into their stuff and then leaking their data so that you can get them crushed um
[6534.76 --> 6540.36]  that's an interesting angle i didn't really think of like it's it's actually an issue because companies
[6540.36 --> 6545.88]  that do a very significant amount to protect their customers data do sometimes get broken into
[6545.88 --> 6549.88]  you know like yeah oh
[6552.76 --> 6558.68]  and it's it's one of those things where it's like who's liable if something gets really like stolen
[6558.68 --> 6565.80]  like not not leaked not carelessly like if if if if you put a lock on your door and you have an alarm
[6565.80 --> 6571.32]  system and you have a dog and someone breaks into your house and takes your stuff and the insurance
[6571.32 --> 6576.92]  company is basically just like i don't know yeah you should have had an automated turret um no
[6576.92 --> 6584.28]  coverage you're gonna be mad right like why is it is it on you're the victim actually yikes yeah
[6584.28 --> 6588.92]  like we really just want to line a bunch of insurance companies pockets because every company
[6588.92 --> 6593.88]  is now going to need mad insurance for this i don't know it's it's a tough one for me i think
[6595.00 --> 6600.76]  i think in general for most sites and services people just need to be more aware that they're
[6600.76 --> 6605.08]  sharing their data and potentially just not sometimes if they're uncomfortable with it
[6605.08 --> 6612.04]  um cough cough things like 23andme and stuff like that um and with other things like when it starts to
[6612.04 --> 6620.76]  touch things like medical and and and whatnot um maybe maybe certain levels of personal data should
[6620.76 --> 6627.88]  have something like that on it uh to try to push companies to try to make sure that they have good
[6627.88 --> 6634.52]  security practices and maybe yeah maybe have insurance in place so that if if people's identities
[6634.52 --> 6639.08]  are stolen or whatnot because of this that that insurance can step in and give them a certain amount
[6639.08 --> 6644.68]  of payout so they can have money uh in the bank to deal with the financial ramifications of that
[6644.68 --> 6654.92]  scenario um security is barely thought about that's just not true dude um like actually not true um
[6656.36 --> 6662.12]  it depends security is barely thought about at some very tiny companies that can't do it because
[6662.12 --> 6667.64]  having a full-time security specialist on your staff is going to be very expensive uh developers are very
[6667.64 --> 6674.36]  expensive as is and then having one specialized on something that you find one that's actually good
[6674.36 --> 6678.76]  and not just bsing you and you just don't understand it well enough to know if they're actually doing a
[6678.76 --> 6687.72]  good job a hundred percent big thing and is that one person enough to hold back the horde um and even if
[6687.72 --> 6694.12]  you have a super super super good security team you're still gonna have vulnerabilities here there so like
[6694.12 --> 6703.96]  you're like it might still happen i don't know it's um it's tough i would love to i'm usually on the
[6703.96 --> 6708.92]  like you know find them harder crush the companies kind of side of things um and i know this might be
[6708.92 --> 6713.88]  this might seem hypocritical because i run a web company that technically has some amount of user data
[6713.88 --> 6722.60]  but i just i don't think all things are equal here um like negligence is the big one but i don't know
[6722.60 --> 6730.52]  exactly how to define it yeah how do you how do you really get someone on that um like like if we if
[6730.52 --> 6737.64]  we think about the forum leak like you you brought up earlier if you think of someone if you think this
[6737.64 --> 6742.76]  thing that this company you like is doing is good if you had a company that you didn't like doing the
[6742.76 --> 6748.68]  same thing would you still think it's good well it's like okay let's flip it around if you if you
[6748.68 --> 6755.00]  think finding these companies for this thing is good are you just as okay with that fine applying to
[6755.00 --> 6760.44]  you if that happens to you that's what that's how i'm trying to kind of place it right now so like when
[6760.44 --> 6766.44]  the forum leak happened it's like yeah it sucked do i think we should have been fined for that i don't
[6766.44 --> 6771.96]  really think so i don't think we did anything particularly wrong and i don't think that the that the data
[6771.96 --> 6778.28]  that was on the forum was like really too crushing for anybody i think the main bad part was
[6778.84 --> 6782.28]  um like you know you probably shouldn't have two passwords used in the same spot
[6782.92 --> 6788.84]  um it wasn't really that big of a deal at the end of the day yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry um
[6790.60 --> 6799.80]  but if you're uh a bank or uh i don't know someone who deals with like passport details or um
[6800.68 --> 6808.12]  sure medical things or things of super high values or social insurance numbers yeah maybe there should
[6808.12 --> 6812.44]  be more precedents on there i don't know necessarily what those requirements would have to be but like
[6813.24 --> 6816.76]  yeah i don't know yeah i think it should maybe be a sliding scale is what i'm trying to say
[6818.36 --> 6825.80]  and to be clear neither of us are condoning in any way the sale of this private data and then you know
[6825.80 --> 6830.92]  the subsequent leakage of it from somewhere else i mean that that is 100 on you you should be fined
[6830.92 --> 6839.24]  into oblivion but in terms of just absolutely destroying any company that has one employee
[6839.24 --> 6847.64]  potentially make a mistake and they were doing their best and like uh i don't necessarily think
[6847.64 --> 6851.00]  that that's going to be sustainable either
[6854.04 --> 6858.52]  can we talk about steam families now though yeah let's jump let's jump back to that speaking of things
[6858.52 --> 6865.40]  that were unsustainable playing games with my kids is a huge problem because up until now
[6865.40 --> 6874.52]  um every kid needs their own copy of everything every kid needs their own copy of everything and
[6874.52 --> 6881.00]  that will still be true to an extent for anything that's online based multiplayer where we all want
[6881.00 --> 6888.44]  to play at the same time but one of the bigger problems for me has been that unlike you know 10 20
[6888.44 --> 6895.32]  years ago where i could buy a library of games and anyone could play any one of those games at a time
[6895.32 --> 6901.88]  without interfering with the others the way that it's worked on steam up until now you can share your
[6901.88 --> 6907.72]  library with your family but only one of you can use that library at a time and it didn't used to be
[6907.72 --> 6914.52]  such a big problem because offline mode was a was a pretty good workaround you could just launch the game
[6914.52 --> 6921.48]  on one machine go offline then launch a different game on another machine and leave that one online
[6921.48 --> 6926.20]  if they're playing something that requires multiplayer or in many cases you could just get away with it
[6926.20 --> 6930.52]  you could just launch the games one after another and it would just kind of work even though strictly
[6930.52 --> 6937.96]  speaking it wasn't supposed to work but then valve locked down offline mode a lot more they do a lot
[6937.96 --> 6945.88]  more online checks and it got to the point where it wasn't doable and they started enforcing their one
[6945.88 --> 6955.48]  game from a library um per in use at a time policy much more strictly to the point where i would log in
[6955.48 --> 6961.16]  to do a quick benchmark at work and it would kick my son off of rocket league at home or whatever the
[6961.16 --> 6966.68]  case may be and it kind of sucks because it used to be you bought your whole library of games and anyone
[6966.68 --> 6971.40]  could play them as long as you weren't both playing the same game at the same time then you know no
[6971.40 --> 6979.08]  harm no foul right um well guess what valve is taking it back to that so they've launched steam
[6979.08 --> 6983.56]  families on the steam beta client which is a collection of new and existing family related
[6983.56 --> 6989.56]  features to replace both steam family sharing and steam family view a steam family can consist of up to
[6989.56 --> 6996.44]  six members and everyone in the steam family gets access to any family sharing compatible games in their
[6996.44 --> 7002.12]  other family members libraries now so instead of only being able to play one game from a library
[7002.12 --> 7009.32]  at a time across the entire family users can now play different games at the same time that's freaking
[7009.32 --> 7014.12]  awesome yeah adults consent parental controls controlling playtime limits allowing access to
[7014.12 --> 7019.40]  appropriate games and more and a child account now has the ability to request for an adult to pay for
[7019.40 --> 7023.00]  their shopping cart making it way easier for parents to purchase games for their kids and
[7023.80 --> 7030.60]  as a parent way more importantly making it way easier for kids to not purchase games on their own
[7032.04 --> 7036.60]  because in the past you basically had to choose between the inconvenience of having to go down and
[7036.60 --> 7041.64]  enter your credit card information every time or the risk of your kids going and buying stuff with a
[7041.64 --> 7051.96]  saved credit card in their account now i do see a downside to this as a developer people how do i feel
[7051.96 --> 7059.56]  about my games being eligible for family sharing now that family sharing is so much more convenient and
[7059.56 --> 7067.64]  so much more powerful like family sharing was basically so kneecapped that i essentially didn't use it i
[7067.64 --> 7075.24]  ended up buying multiple copies of games just so that i wouldn't have to worry about interrupting my
[7075.24 --> 7079.00]  kids while they're playing when i want to play or when i want to benchmark something or whatever the case
[7079.00 --> 7090.28]  may be as it is now it seems like um a lot fewer people will have to do that and as their own independent
[7090.28 --> 7096.92]  living breathing organisms you know should my kids be entitled or my roommates or my friends or whoever
[7096.92 --> 7104.20]  my family is should they be entitled to play these games they didn't buy um will i be less likely to
[7104.20 --> 7108.84]  make my game eligible for family sharing under this system what would you how would you feel
[7111.32 --> 7116.60]  yeah i don't know i'm reading through the faq right now because i'm trying to get a vibe for like
[7116.60 --> 7121.48]  how a family unit could be formed because one thing that i'm worried about if i'm a developer
[7122.60 --> 7131.72]  is the you know a close-knit group of six friends at school form a family um and share one steam account
[7131.72 --> 7140.52]  amongst all of them and and and polycules are totally okay i'm not judging sure yeah i mean there's like 32 000
[7140.52 --> 7148.52]  in the seattle one and it's growing every day it's not sustainable so yeah i don't know it doesn't
[7148.52 --> 7154.68]  sound like there's any limitations to like under one roof or anything like that um i'm actually not
[7154.68 --> 7161.32]  really finding pretty much any limitations at all um they they do say that the the terms of how they
[7161.32 --> 7166.44]  define a family is subject to change so maybe they'll figure that out over time um there's also some
[7166.44 --> 7172.68]  interesting stuff if you leave a steam family um you will need to wait one year from when you
[7174.12 --> 7179.88]  from when you joined the previous one oh that's not that big of a deal oh interesting so you can't
[7179.88 --> 7186.92]  just like float around from family to family but one year from your join date of the previous one not
[7186.92 --> 7194.44]  your exit date so if you if you okay well that kind of makes sense that could be a zero day difference
[7194.44 --> 7202.12]  if you're at above a year um yeah as long as you as long as you don't um well basically it says that
[7203.08 --> 7208.68]  you don't have to mourn your old family for a year yeah as long as you were with them for at least a
[7208.68 --> 7215.40]  year yeah which might be good for some people you know things happen in in family units um it's just
[7215.40 --> 7223.00]  i don't know i would want to enable this but it is definitely a scenario where i i guarantee you people
[7223.00 --> 7231.72]  are going to misuse it now honestly in most situations at work man our benchmark accounts
[7231.72 --> 7235.56]  we're only going to have to have a couple of copies of every game spread out across all of
[7235.56 --> 7239.96]  our benchmark accounts which is going to make it way more effective for us to use those benchmark
[7239.96 --> 7246.12]  accounts are in a family dude they're all well yeah it's clearly not a family though like yeah
[7246.12 --> 7253.48]  there's definitely uses for this that are not going to be family now i yeah honestly i think that
[7253.96 --> 7259.96]  there's nothing wrong with that um us basically not necessarily buy like five copies of every stupid
[7259.96 --> 7265.40]  game just so that we can run them for 20 minutes every week to benchmark them or whatever but if it
[7265.40 --> 7270.68]  is that friend group from school i used to share games with my friends you'd trade games all the time
[7270.68 --> 7275.80]  temporarily like oh i have this snest game you have this n64 game we both have both consoles for
[7275.80 --> 7279.72]  some reason i don't know why i made this analogy this weird but you can borrow this one i'll borrow
[7279.72 --> 7286.04]  that one and we'll trade back in a week or two whatever that was totally very normal um i understand
[7286.04 --> 7289.72]  that making it all digital and making giving it the ease of use of something like steam is going to
[7289.72 --> 7294.44]  massively increase the amount of that trading that happens but you are sort of locked into this family
[7294.44 --> 7298.36]  unit for a year at a time so it's not like you're jumping all over the place based on what game you want to play
[7298.36 --> 7307.80]  um so i don't know i hope it goes okay because this seems like a really cool thing um and honestly
[7307.80 --> 7312.68]  the main way that i would potentially use it is to like encourage people to pick up a game themselves
[7313.56 --> 7321.64]  um like here look you can borrow this for a bit i've definitely never lent anyone my origin account so
[7321.64 --> 7327.00]  that they could try out titanfall 2 and then convince them to just buy it for themselves afterwards
[7327.00 --> 7332.68]  um that's definitely never a thing that i've done by the way neither of us is recommending ever doing
[7332.68 --> 7339.64]  do not lend out your game accounts yeah um but it's just like yeah i don't know i think
[7341.48 --> 7347.48]  i would be okay with it i think i would turn it on yeah i think it's pretty cool i think it's good i i'm
[7347.48 --> 7353.56]  a little bit worried about how this might go but i really hope it goes well because i think it's
[7353.56 --> 7361.08]  overall a very good thing yeah and i think honestly it might encourage the sales out of
[7363.72 --> 7370.12]  okay there are definitely things that are not going to be universally regarded as good things
[7370.12 --> 7377.40]  and i think it's time for us to shift our conversation to the smosh song that they released
[7377.40 --> 7384.36]  uh i think it was earlier this week or last week called submissive and breedable a collaboration with
[7384.36 --> 7393.96]  bb no money um that has baby no money it's baby no money don't say bb no money come on oh why do i have
[7393.96 --> 7404.36]  any idea who this is oh he's good i like his music genuinely come on okay so the point is um the official
[7404.36 --> 7410.84]  music video uh luke do you want to pull it up yeah sure if you guys want you all go to the same time
[7410.84 --> 7421.64]  stamp uh so maybe maybe head to about 1 30 about 1 30. yep and then you guys can if everyone heads over

[7539.48 --> 7549.08]  they truly are every flavor i presume okay they truly truly are are we ready oh that was gross okay hit it
[7558.28 --> 7558.76]  oh no
[7561.16 --> 7575.24]  so
[7575.24 --> 7596.36]  so how do you how do you feel about your name being attached to a song of that type and name
[7598.46 --> 7601.94]  keynote quality 10 out of 10 5 out of 7 perfect score
[7601.94 --> 7607.66]  can i just can i just say does it help that you don't have the beard anymore
[7607.66 --> 7618.94]  it isn't usually a problem that um you know linus is slaying for penis because i mean there's so
[7618.94 --> 7625.54]  many names that are slaying for penis you know peter johnson uh dick right like it's not really
[7625.54 --> 7632.60]  uh that one's a little on point yeah okay you know yeah i i i i i just mean it it doesn't really
[7632.60 --> 7641.18]  come up that much technically it's a slang but nobody really uses it um as for the whole like
[7641.18 --> 7648.12]  tip thing and tech tips and and and linus um
[7648.12 --> 7654.16]  this is actually the second time this has happened i don't know if you remember that
[7654.16 --> 7661.42]  the previous song yeah yeah yeah so so the the previous song to kind of make this a thing
[7661.42 --> 7669.24]  uh is from the mom boys here we go yeah and i guess what i'm trying to say is
[7669.24 --> 7677.56]  i've kind of enjoyed that while linus is technically slang for penis nobody really uses it
[7677.56 --> 7686.80]  and now that it's happened twice it feels dangerously close to becoming a thing um yeah yeah yeah
[7686.80 --> 7694.20]  i can't i can't really say that it's my preference i don't think people are really using it that way
[7694.20 --> 7700.36]  i think they're just riffing off of tip i just to be honest yeah i think you're reading artistic
[7700.36 --> 7706.38]  expression you know tip and and linus is is a good cultural reference i would i would uh i would
[7706.38 --> 7711.64]  agree with that i don't think it's minus meaning penis i don't think anyone's doing that to be honest
[7711.64 --> 7718.56]  i want i want okay i want bb merch now that just says like just the tips i'm gonna wear it around
[7718.56 --> 7726.72]  work if if baby no money releases merch that that's it what is a submissive and readable i'm not saying
[7726.72 --> 7729.04]  i am not wearing anything else
[7729.04 --> 7739.04]  oh my gosh i mean you should see my computer backgrounds to start with like geez yeah yeah
[7739.68 --> 7745.28]  yeah i don't know how do you how do you feel about it did they reach out to you or did they just do it
[7745.28 --> 7751.92]  you don't you don't have to reach out to it based yeah they don't they don't need to reach out that's
[7751.92 --> 7758.56]  they're they're on they're on base as far as that goes uh like i'm not i'm not saying this is not well
[7758.56 --> 7765.52]  within their rights to do i'm just saying it's you know no i was just wondering i'm not yeah are you
[7765.52 --> 7771.44]  are you not flattered i would be flattered i think it's very flattering i am you're you're culturally
[7771.44 --> 7780.24]  relevant enough to uh yeah to be a clever simile in a in a uh in a piece of artistic work that people
[7780.24 --> 7787.52]  will understand too yes like that's that's huge yeah you know like uh you can make references to
[7787.52 --> 7797.36]  napoleon for you know other things or other ideas right smosh is my bad yeah uh and you're there you're
[7797.36 --> 7805.44]  there i'm not likening you to napoleon that was an accident but you're like tech napoleon there you
[7805.44 --> 7813.28]  go what he's short and in another country so he's just pulling yeah there you go where does it where
[7813.28 --> 7822.24]  does napoleon put his armies up his sleeveies lttstore.com yeah oh my goodness
[7822.24 --> 7836.08]  wow so um honestly my first reaction to this was that i just have no idea uh what to make of it um
[7836.08 --> 7847.20]  that seems i i i've uh i've i've met um you know i've met the smosh guys i uh i think they're super cool i
[7847.20 --> 7853.04]  um have a lot of respect for them they're pioneers you know and that's that's sort of separate right
[7853.04 --> 7859.84]  like you can think someone's super cool um or like cool or whatever um but you know know things about
[7859.84 --> 7863.76]  them and you're like oh yeah i don't respect them these guys i i think they're super cool and i respect
[7863.76 --> 7870.96]  them a lot um absolute builders of this space which is really cool i'm so happy to see that they're you
[7870.96 --> 7877.44]  you know back together got their channel back that this is you know one of the outcomes of that was
[7877.44 --> 7890.48]  not something that i had on my bingo yeah that's pretty funny uh um seeing that uh other great creators
[7890.48 --> 7898.96]  are making music uh christmas album to win oh my god um
[7900.96 --> 7907.84]  smosh the halls with something something yeah sexy sexy christmas album
[7909.76 --> 7915.52]  searching for the clearest i guess like i don't know these these lyrics though dude like lenovo think pad
[7918.00 --> 7918.64]  oh man
[7920.80 --> 7929.36]  uh okay so anywho um i don't yeah i don't know what else to say about this i i really i don't i don't
[7929.36 --> 7935.92]  know if i've fully got an answer to like how do you feel about uh it it being this title and subject
[7935.92 --> 7941.92]  matter of a song that your name was in not not like oh people are using my name for for penis i mean more
[7941.92 --> 7947.68]  that it's it's submissive and breedable specifically that you're referenced in does that bother you at
[7947.68 --> 7952.00]  all or just it doesn't matter that really matters yeah i know okay yeah i don't think that really matters
[7952.00 --> 7957.84]  i mean art is uh art is art i yeah i'm not really i'm not really going to go in and sort of question
[7957.84 --> 7964.32]  someone else's voice and someone else's someone else's art i mean they're obviously not um they're
[7964.32 --> 7971.68]  they're they're they're not um it's it's not slanderous or defamatory in any way it didn't seem like it at
[7971.68 --> 7976.88]  all yeah yeah it's it's nothing to do with anything other than just like
[7979.20 --> 7986.48]  whatever taken on my tip first thing like linus means first and maybe maybe this is just one of
[7986.48 --> 7993.60]  those things where um i just don't understand it because it's some kind of slang that i am too i think
[7993.60 --> 7998.48]  it's more they were if i have to assume it's because they were searching for something to rhyme
[7998.48 --> 8007.36]  with feral boy friday she the lioness yeah yeah no that line is really good after i think so maybe
[8011.12 --> 8016.08]  i don't know maybe either way i think that's a good take on it because like it doesn't at all seem
[8016.08 --> 8020.72]  like anything was nefarious here it's just supposed to be a funny song i i think some people would be
[8020.72 --> 8027.68]  like i'm i'm not that i don't want to be included in this um and that's just yeah whatever i don't
[8027.68 --> 8033.36]  know that's a fair enough take but it's kind of boring and i prefer just not caring and thinking
[8033.36 --> 8041.28]  zero point says i don't like the rhyme of linus with lioness um the reason you don't like that is
[8041.28 --> 8050.00]  not uh subjective uh it's objective those things do not rhyme uh but some artistic license was taken
[8050.00 --> 8056.88]  and i was gonna say it's it's not does not rhyme that is super common in music people will pronounce
[8056.88 --> 8062.00]  they'll change even how they say words to make them sound like they flow together so yeah i wouldn't
[8062.00 --> 8074.40]  that's a i drive a chevrolet movie theater interior crocodile alligator mr mr biggie biggie smalls
[8074.40 --> 8082.24]  yeah yeah yeah it's it's classic it's lovely yeah yeah speaking of uh things that are lovely
[8082.24 --> 8089.28]  you know that's hilarious by the way luke thought that was what the word was yeah yeah yeah not that
[8089.28 --> 8095.84]  long ago i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think a lot of people think that that would be i think a
[8095.84 --> 8102.00]  ton of people like that to be honest i think biggie was an extremely influential person okay it's unlimited
[8102.00 --> 8109.04]  unlimited he defines language yeah okay you guys you guys have never done art have you
[8113.68 --> 8118.88]  okay uh speaking of things that are cool first human to receive neural link this is actually uh
[8118.88 --> 8125.28]  pretty cool hopefully it doesn't go poorly from here uh 29 year old nolan arbau a quadriplegic
[8125.28 --> 8131.60]  says that the brain implant has allowed him to play chess and civilization on his pc using his freaking
[8131.60 --> 8137.68]  mind he's quoted saying i'm so freaking lucky to be a part of this the implant works by reading brain
[8137.68 --> 8143.12]  signals from the user and translating them into bluetooth based remote commands to control an
[8143.12 --> 8149.68]  electronic device like a mouse cursor for arbau this is this part was like okay that's pretty cool
[8149.68 --> 8154.40]  uh for arbau this initially involved trying to move his hands obviously he can't because he's
[8154.40 --> 8160.08]  quadriplegic but trying to and even though he's lost the ability to move them that would translate
[8160.08 --> 8168.08]  into mouse cursor movement which is like no way wild to honestly even really think about from there it
[8168.08 --> 8173.76]  just became intuitive for him to start imagining the cursor moving and basically it was like he was using
[8173.76 --> 8179.36]  the force on a cursor and he could get it to move wherever he wanted this resulted in an eight
[8179.36 --> 8185.92]  hour straight gaming session on civ 6 outside of the standard neural link trials and he just had
[8185.92 --> 8191.84]  to quit because the device needed to wirelessly charge um also he stated that um we've ran into
[8191.84 --> 8196.24]  some issues i don't want people to think this is the end of the journey there's still a lot of work to
[8196.24 --> 8203.36]  be done but it has already changed my life so so far um that's really cool for people who might be
[8203.36 --> 8208.64]  struggling with something like uh being a quadriplegic being able to be enabled to
[8209.36 --> 8216.08]  have more things to do be able to play chess be able to play civ that's fantastic super cool
[8216.08 --> 8222.16]  i think that's great really really cool hopefully like i said earlier it doesn't go bad um
[8223.28 --> 8227.20]  uh but yeah wanted to share some good news what else do we got
[8227.20 --> 8232.16]  glassware's not on the list
[8232.16 --> 8240.00]  expensable menu um oh this is old this is great after lax last week's tax write-off sale community
[8240.00 --> 8245.84]  members on the ltt forum pointed out that there was a restaurant in toronto called good fortune
[8245.84 --> 8252.72]  that had a campaign where they renamed their menu items after office supplies so that office workers could
[8252.72 --> 8259.84]  expense them uh luke do you want to screen share that for the kind folks out there yeah um we've got
[8259.84 --> 8270.72]  the um diamond chicken burger aka the mini dry erase whiteboard we've got the uh double your fortune burger
[8270.72 --> 8280.32]  renamed the ergonomic aluminum laptop stand the emerald veggie burger renamed the wired earphones with mike
[8280.32 --> 8290.40]  and their french fries palm fries uh or palm fries renamed usb wired mouse i like the discussion
[8293.36 --> 8300.24]  my favorite one is the three oh boy that's a little cheaper damn this delay though our discussion
[8300.24 --> 8308.80]  question is isn't a little cheap for an aluminum laptop stand uh depends if it's for apple yes
[8310.32 --> 8317.60]  uh yeah that's fair yeah i thought it was pretty funny it is it is i think it's been reposted because
[8317.60 --> 8323.12]  this this was happened a long time ago i think um yeah it was a long time ago yeah okay okay sounds
[8323.12 --> 8328.88]  good it was uh it was a short-term promo i mean should we do it on the store anyone want to anyone
[8328.88 --> 8335.20]  want to write off some ltt merch like this the funny part is fraud it's fine some amount of ltt merch
[8335.20 --> 8341.60]  would be like you have screwdrivers cable management tools thermal paste like a lot of it would be fine
[8343.12 --> 8349.92]  it just is already okay backpacks business that needed that could potentially okay i don't know
[8351.36 --> 8356.56]  a lot of it might be fine uh what else we got i don't think we have much i think we're mostly through
[8356.56 --> 8365.12]  it um oh but we haven't talked about the apex legends hack oh and we have some announcements and
[8365.12 --> 8369.36]  there's some other things going on we got stuff i just have to scroll up to find it uh i'll do this
[8369.36 --> 8374.88]  one during an official apex legends tournament last weekend at least two professional players were
[8374.88 --> 8382.16]  allegedly hacked mid-game leading to the final of the apex legends global series being postponed in two
[8382.16 --> 8388.88]  separate matches imperial hall or sorry yeah imperial hall was given an aimbot and again burton
[8389.52 --> 8394.56]  was suddenly able to see the location and health of everyone else in the round the cheat menu was
[8394.56 --> 8401.36]  opened on gimburton's screen contained a joke option of vote putin and a message was sent via his in-game
[8401.36 --> 8410.08]  chat which read apex hacking global series by destroyer 2009 and random the anti-cheat police department a
[8410.08 --> 8416.16]  a volunteer-run group that gathers intelligence on cheats and cheat vendors wow i didn't know this
[8416.16 --> 8422.32]  was a thing issued a statement saying that there was a remote code execution exploit present in either
[8422.32 --> 8429.52]  the game itself or an easy anti-cheat easy anti-cheat however denied that there was any remote code
[8429.52 --> 8438.32]  execution vulnerability within their system in their first tweet in five years destroyer 2009 uh the hacker
[8438.32 --> 8443.52]  taking responsibility for the incident has since spoken to tech crunch and said that the hack was
[8443.52 --> 8448.48]  mostly just for fun but also to force respawn to fix the vulnerability he used to hack them
[8448.48 --> 8455.04]  ea doesn't have a bug bounty program uh he didn't say exactly how he you uh how he hacked the matches
[8455.04 --> 8458.56]  beyond that it had nothing to do with the server and it never went outside the game
[8459.44 --> 8465.52]  and didn't involve infecting either players rig or malware destroyer 2009 apparently with malware
[8465.52 --> 8470.64]  with malware sorry destroyer 2009 apparently has a reputation for hacking high profile players for
[8470.64 --> 8477.60]  the lulz as for why he specifically targeted again burton and imperial how destroyer 2009 said that
[8477.60 --> 8483.28]  they're just nice guys who deserve free attention and views discussion question is this a problem
[8483.28 --> 8490.32]  specific to apex legends why aren't games like this more secure i mean the reason i wanted to talk about
[8490.32 --> 8496.48]  this this week was because you've been kind of going off on the state of online gaming and how utterly
[8496.48 --> 8504.16]  broken it is we talked last week about a hypothetical peripheral that basically was watching everything
[8504.16 --> 8509.68]  you did in real time to ensure that absolutely nothing that happened on screen had any disconnect from
[8509.68 --> 8516.88]  what your hands were doing in person um something like this the ability of a hacker to force another
[8516.88 --> 8525.68]  player to cheat i think shows a how sophisticated the software is getting how sophisticated these um
[8525.68 --> 8534.16]  these players are getting and b how utterly unsalvageable online gaming is um like i just don't
[8534.16 --> 8540.24]  really know what else to say at this point i i think like i've talked at length about why i you know i
[8540.24 --> 8545.36]  had to find a way i had to find a way and i got it i got my way but i've talked at length about how games like
[8545.36 --> 8552.80]  ballers gate 3 and uh hell divers and other like more recent kind of co-op or even single player
[8552.80 --> 8558.56]  focused games there's a fantastic very well working co-op mod for elden ring but elden ring is
[8559.68 --> 8566.16]  more a single player game um elden ring popped off a lot of these non-online competitive games have been
[8566.16 --> 8572.24]  doing very well lately and i think in no small part it's because hacking in competitive games has gotten to
[8572.24 --> 8580.00]  a ridiculous point um and i don't i don't know if it's because companies aren't investing enough
[8580.00 --> 8586.08]  or if it's just a losing battle no matter what they do or what it is but the percentages of cheaters in
[8586.08 --> 8594.56]  games is crazy the amount of streamers that get caught all the time cheating is wild because if the
[8594.56 --> 8599.68]  cheaters are the streamers are getting caught cheating you know there's a lot more because it's a lot
[8599.68 --> 8607.04]  easier when you're not on stream um so it's just it's it's frustrating and it ruins things because
[8607.68 --> 8615.04]  the the biggest problem which we've also talked about is it brings to to doubt every other loss or
[8615.04 --> 8620.24]  death or whatever it is that you have in a game even if that person isn't cheating it's like well
[8621.68 --> 8627.28]  were they did i actually lose because of a skill gap did i actually lose because of a lack of
[8627.28 --> 8632.96]  preparation whatever else or did i lose just because this person's cheating which really
[8632.96 --> 8638.08]  sours the whole experience i think a lot of people out there are okay with you know not being good
[8638.08 --> 8643.68]  enough to win all the time but don't really feel super okay with losing because you know the other
[8643.68 --> 8650.56]  person might have actually been worse but they installed something and now they win anyways um so it's it's
[8650.56 --> 8657.44]  it's rough i know a lot of people personally that have kind of stopped really playing that many
[8657.44 --> 8662.32]  online competitive games especially online competitive shooters i even know people that
[8662.32 --> 8665.92]  have traditionally not really been interested in anything other than online competitive shooters
[8665.92 --> 8671.28]  that have started shifting to things like league of legends of all games because yes you can cheat
[8671.28 --> 8678.56]  in league of legends really yeah but it's a lot less impactful than cheating in something like say warzone or
[8678.56 --> 8684.88]  or or valorant or call of duty or um or counter-strike or something like that um so
[8686.96 --> 8692.72]  yeah it is what it is but this sucks this sucks a lot uh there's a merch message here that i want to
[8692.72 --> 8701.60]  jump to real quick because it's kind of on topic uh from brandon g luke larian announced today that
[8701.60 --> 8708.48]  balder's gate will not be getting any major dlc as someone who hasn't played yet this gets rid of a barrier
[8708.48 --> 8715.36]  to entry for me but how does it feel for a long-term player yeah i'll speak to that um i've actually
[8715.36 --> 8725.36]  reached out to them with this already uh i am sad strong disagree very angry no actually i'm i'm sad
[8725.36 --> 8729.76]  because i really like the characters i really like the story and there's honestly a lot of ways that i
[8729.76 --> 8736.48]  could see it going that i think would be fantastic that team is amazing from from bottom to the top as far
[8736.48 --> 8742.56]  as i can tell so i think they would make a very good dlc but if you read the article more the reason
[8742.56 --> 8748.08]  that they give for doing so is because they didn't think their hearts were in it apparently there was
[8748.08 --> 8753.28]  communication before bg3 was released about other projects that they could work on that were not bg3
[8753.28 --> 8759.20]  and the the team was excited to work on those and when bg3 was this like incredible smash hit success
[8759.76 --> 8765.36]  the natural stepping for a gaming company is to make dlc or additional content of some kind through
[8765.36 --> 8769.92]  expansions or whatever else so they can continue to monetize that game that is what you naturally do
[8769.92 --> 8777.52]  so larian stepped into that normal thing that you do but their hearts weren't really in it
[8778.16 --> 8784.88]  they were excited to work on this other thing and the the ceo of of larian sven vicky i hope i
[8784.88 --> 8790.72]  pronounce his name correctly um just decided like you know what no we're gonna do the thing that we
[8790.72 --> 8797.60]  really want to do which is this next project that they're not announcing um and you know what i have
[8797.60 --> 8803.28]  some sadness for not receiving dlc for this game that's fantastic but i have more excitement for the
[8803.28 --> 8808.88]  next thing that they end up doing so as far as i'm concerned it's the right move i think that's good
[8808.88 --> 8816.64]  if they if they're if they're well-funded a well-funded next thing yeah exactly right like whatever um
[8816.64 --> 8822.40]  so yeah i don't know i think that's uh i think that's good i also think the next thing that they're
[8822.40 --> 8828.96]  doing is not specifically dnd there's been some talks about that as well uh which might be a good
[8828.96 --> 8835.52]  move their previous game uh original sin 2 as far as my understanding goes is not based on any of that
[8835.52 --> 8841.92]  and it's fantastic um i i don't think they need to be attached to dnd at all personally i don't think
[8841.92 --> 8846.80]  that's required in the slightest i think they have no issue creating worlds creating interesting
[8846.80 --> 8851.60]  storylines creating interesting character bases all that type of stuff i think they'll be completely
[8851.60 --> 8859.36]  fine doing that um so yeah i'm excited for whatever they do next and the motivations behind this move
[8859.92 --> 8863.76]  make me excited for the fact that they did this move despite the fact that i'm still sad that i don't
[8863.76 --> 8870.96]  get dlc so yeah i think it's good i'm also happy i'll say this that they're not farming the dlc out
[8870.96 --> 8876.16]  to some other company who's going to screw it up uh because we we see stuff like that happen as well
[8876.72 --> 8883.12]  um so they didn't they didn't talk about this like this game yes they they didn't talk about
[8883.12 --> 8888.32]  doing this because i don't think it ever even came to mind necessarily but there are absolutely
[8888.32 --> 8892.88]  companies that have done that and would do that and they're not doing that as far as i can tell so
[8892.88 --> 8900.08]  that's great because i would rather it doesn't get touched then it gets ruined so yeah i'm cool with that
[8900.96 --> 8906.96]  all right are there any other topics we want to get through real quick here i feel like
[8908.24 --> 8914.64]  um the canadia ban on flipper zero update could probably use a little bit of discussion
[8915.28 --> 8919.92]  the makers of the flipper zero have published an official response to the canadian government's
[8919.92 --> 8924.72]  proposed ban on both the zero and similar devices as a way of reducing audio theft
[8924.72 --> 8930.80]  um but here's the thing a primary argument against banning the flipper zero is the fact
[8930.80 --> 8936.08]  oh okay yeah here's the thing the flipper zero lacks the hardware necessary to replicate a keyless
[8936.08 --> 8941.60]  fob in order to gain entry into a car car thieves can use a keyless repeater system to pick up the
[8941.60 --> 8946.32]  signal of a keyless fob near the entrance of a home and transmit it to a nearby car but the equipment
[8946.32 --> 8951.92]  needed to pull this off is quite a bit larger taking up the space of a backpack and far more expensive
[8952.48 --> 8958.08]  about six thousand dollars online the flipper zero can capture and replicate the code from a remote
[8958.08 --> 8963.28]  control but can't replicate the kind of rolling code used by car fobs the flipper zero creators
[8963.28 --> 8968.40]  further argue that many security systems are currently relying on security through obscurity i.e
[8968.40 --> 8972.48]  relying on most people simply not knowing enough about the system to exploit its flaws which is one of
[8972.48 --> 8980.48]  the reasons that the flipper zero exists needless to say i agree um with flipper and the canadian
[8980.48 --> 8986.80]  government is being big dumb um also evga who traditionally has been in the news for being
[8986.80 --> 8995.52]  super cool is in the news for something not super cool a reddit user you slash sigurds kiss whatever
[8995.52 --> 9003.60]  was recently cross-posted to the ltt subreddit the user bought a new evga gq 1000 watt gold power supply
[9003.60 --> 9011.12]  however it was defective which isn't necessarily a problem stuff happens but he sent it back to evga
[9011.12 --> 9015.76]  who told the user hey hold on to the cables and accessories that came with the unit and just send
[9015.76 --> 9023.60]  back the power supply when they received their new unit they connected their old cables and the pc failed
[9023.60 --> 9028.64]  to start and there was a click possibly indicating that an overload protection circuit had been triggered
[9028.64 --> 9033.92]  they immediately rechecked the cables which were the correct ev they were evga cables but after
[9033.92 --> 9038.16]  some troubleshooting they checked the voltages of their state of power with a multimeter and found
[9038.16 --> 9045.28]  that it was way off 12 volt instead of 3 volt and 0 volts instead of 5 volts etc upon the issue being
[9045.28 --> 9050.88]  reported to evga customer service was able to determine the problem within a matter of minutes at
[9050.88 --> 9060.88]  some point the pin layout of that power supply was changed this incident destroyed 22 terabytes of
[9060.88 --> 9066.72]  sata drives and this is where things get really bad because all this is bad but this is where things
[9066.72 --> 9074.64]  get really bad sata support has suggested to the user that they seek a warranty replacement from the
[9074.64 --> 9086.16]  manufacturer of the hard drives rather than evga compensating them for the drives in order to replace them excuse me
[9089.52 --> 9098.40]  so evga is basically suggesting to the user that they do a little they do a little fraud on their hard
[9098.40 --> 9104.48]  drive manufacturer instead of evga ponying up for their mistake
[9107.44 --> 9111.68]  this sucks that's really bad uh it's interesting because what
[9114.16 --> 9117.76]  i think they should do it i don't know why it says sata drives because like
[9118.32 --> 9123.76]  what you expecting there to be ide drives like well because it was the sata connector that the uh that
[9123.76 --> 9128.08]  the voltages were screwed up on yeah but what i'm saying is i can't tell if this is hard disk or ssds
[9129.04 --> 9135.44]  there's a drastic difference in cost doesn't matter just yeah well i'm at 22 terabytes i'm assuming
[9135.44 --> 9146.32]  they're hard drives yeah um oh that that shouldn't even be if it's hard drives i mean if it's either
[9146.32 --> 9152.24]  of them you just kind of have to stomach it it gets weird because if you're not the manufacturer of
[9152.24 --> 9158.00]  the drives how are you verifying that this is at all what happened but at that point like you
[9158.00 --> 9165.36]  screwed up so bad you just got to deal with it i think this sucks a lot because i one of the big
[9165.36 --> 9170.08]  reasons why i used to like evga so much was because their customer service was so good to me but that
[9170.08 --> 9179.60]  was also over a decade ago so i don't know it is what it is stuff like this makes me feel like uh evga
[9179.60 --> 9186.00]  is uh not the company that they used to be yeah i i had never heard of them doing anything like this
[9186.00 --> 9192.00]  in the past not at all ever i've given stories of how good of customer service they'd had a million
[9192.00 --> 9197.68]  times i've never heard anyone counter it and then this is like this is rough let's talk uh let's
[9197.68 --> 9201.92]  talk announcements float plane spring break want to talk us through what that is yeah we've got
[9201.92 --> 9207.68]  something special coming for our float plane members from next monday march 25th through march 29th
[9207.68 --> 9213.68]  we're releasing extra special float plane exclusives as part of what we're calling float plane spring break
[9213.68 --> 9218.64]  it's also because we just made too many exclusives for the month which is a fun problem to have
[9218.64 --> 9223.92]  we'll also be doing some giveaways including a set of custom apos ltt keycaps you just saw those

[9276.80 --> 9284.24]  there was a bulge it's here right there you see it on the boxer on the boxer key yeah yeah super cute
[9284.24 --> 9285.36]  it's pretty sizable
[9288.88 --> 9290.72]  what did i say earlier it was normal size

[9367.28 --> 9373.36]  departmental airplane paper airplane battle we did unmute i mean that's the use of the time
[9374.40 --> 9379.36]  uh my name is luke lafrenner that's not how you we got one person from each department to do a
[9379.36 --> 9384.32]  paper airplane battle to see who can do the best design who can make it the fastest and who can
[9384.32 --> 9389.44]  throw it the farthest hi uh my name is luke lafrenner that's not how you pronounce it i'm the ceo of
[9389.44 --> 9394.40]  of floatplane and the cto for linus media group that's not even accurate they didn't listen to
[9394.40 --> 9397.52]  me hold on this is wrong i'm not the floatplane ceo
[9401.44 --> 9402.40]  do we not have ecc
[9404.32 --> 9409.84]  so like by default i'm gonna do bad so as a side objective i'm gonna bring you random facts about
[9409.84 --> 9416.40]  canada that progressively get more deranged over time and i'm gonna start with that winnie pooh is
[9416.40 --> 9422.48]  based off of a winnie the pooh canada wait really yeah which bear just a bear that was in a zoo i
[9422.48 --> 9427.92]  think i don't know a bear named what's also crazy winnie yeah is that canada was in a war
[9429.28 --> 9433.28]  someone asked which bear it's like well we were at war with denmark until 2022
[9433.28 --> 9438.08]  it's called the whiskey war the reason why it was called the whiskey war going there planting their
[9438.08 --> 9443.76]  respective flag canada would leave whiskey and denmark would leave schnapps and they did that for like
[9443.76 --> 9450.40]  50 years and then sadly it ended in 2022. sadly well that was the coolest thing ever and then they
[9450.40 --> 9455.36]  were like nah as long as i don't step over the crack yeah so i can take a running start yeah no
[9455.36 --> 9459.12]  i just want to see what it's going to do oh my god okay that's not good
[9461.84 --> 9465.92]  wait no i think that's over here hold on dude you suck would you say that's not over the crack
[9466.56 --> 9474.40]  just for you i'll let it pass okay okay and then oh my god dude that's the worst airplane design
[9474.40 --> 9477.04]  what are you even doing it's gonna hit you in the foot
[9482.72 --> 9489.52]  wow i'm going to the z drive right now anyways anyways anyways i didn't spend any time even googling how
[9489.52 --> 9496.96]  to fold a paper airplane and i haven't made one in like 15 16 years uh so i just googled canada facts
[9496.96 --> 9502.24]  and then tried to bring entertainment to the video that way linus i tried to make the video more
[9502.24 --> 9506.88]  entertaining linus do you not do you not mentor luke
[9509.36 --> 9513.76]  not anymore man no we don't we don't actually work together other than wanshow

[9584.48 --> 9592.32]  that works should i push the birdie bots every flavor bean yes okay wait wait wait yes do that but
[9592.32 --> 9597.60]  i really hope i don't get ashtray this time before before we go into merch messages you gotta tell us
[9597.60 --> 9603.60]  about your trip how's japan you've been there for a bit now oh boy well the birdie bots every flavored
[9603.60 --> 9613.36]  beans have uh not gone so far have any of them good is there is supposed to be good ones right isn't there
[9613.36 --> 9625.28]  oh god um oh oh i feel like i feel nauseous need some water um that is truly an unpleasant experience
[9625.28 --> 9631.20]  i can guarantee you that if you just drink soy sauce the flavor will of the the bean will go away
[9631.76 --> 9640.16]  umami bean thank you for that um oh that was awful yeah so not recommended
[9643.84 --> 9646.64]  yeah okay no but seriously how's how's japan been
[9646.64 --> 9655.76]  um this is getting through um this is getting good i got to tick i got to tick off my bucket list uh
[9655.76 --> 9664.32]  last night uh getting to experience being shoved into a packed japanese train ah nice that's um good
[9664.32 --> 9673.68]  that's a thing that happened i felt really bad for the guy um across the train from where i was standing
[9673.68 --> 9679.92]  because i had our stroller in front of me with two children in it and whoever was jamming from the
[9679.92 --> 9688.08]  door could not see that there was a stroller that was like digging into this guy's knee um and they
[9688.08 --> 9693.84]  were just they were packing he had nowhere to go and i was just i looked at him i'm just like i have no
[9693.84 --> 9700.40]  way to prevent this like the the brakes are applied on the stroller but that means nothing nothing yeah
[9700.40 --> 9707.20]  yeah like i yeah it was only for a couple of stops but yeah they they actually did the thing where the
[9707.20 --> 9714.40]  like platform person came and shoved people into the train like it's real that's wild i don't think
[9714.40 --> 9718.88]  i've ever actually because of the stroller like rolling it must have felt like there was a bit of
[9718.88 --> 9725.28]  give in it or something because they kept giving her it was pretty rough dude i felt really bad for the guy
[9725.28 --> 9734.00]  it's not over 9 000 is saying uh oh he's talking about the other stuff yeah um yeah how well how's
[9734.00 --> 9738.32]  okay so how is japan and so far you said he got shoved onto a train what else have you done what
[9738.32 --> 9743.28]  have you enjoyed what are good things tell me about it and you often don't like traveling so i'm trying
[9743.28 --> 9750.88]  to dig for like has anything good happened have you enjoyed your trip um super nintendo world at
[9750.88 --> 9759.84]  universal studios is one of the most elaborate beautiful outstanding construction projects i think
[9759.84 --> 9769.68]  i've ever seen um cool it was it was crafted with a level of of of care and love that i just uh think
[9769.68 --> 9777.44]  i've rarely encountered the entire place is a complete work of art there's like two rides one of which is for
[9777.44 --> 9784.72]  very very very small children um and a bunch of just like places to buy merch in fact i'd say
[9784.72 --> 9789.76]  universal studios in japan in general um has some sort of
[9792.40 --> 9800.72]  incongruity i guess is how i would describe it like um you know it's it's it's a bit of a cultural
[9801.76 --> 9807.20]  it's not even apparently rude it just like isn't done to to drink a beverage while you're walking
[9807.20 --> 9814.48]  around so why do you need vending machines with beverages everywhere you know like that um everything
[9814.48 --> 9824.08]  comes so over packaged but there's no garbage cans um they every people people live in i'm in an
[9824.08 --> 9829.84]  apartment right now people live in apartments where as far as i can tell there's absolutely no space to
[9829.84 --> 9836.00]  store things but so many of the experiences that you have are to just buy random
[9836.00 --> 9841.36]  like i just i'm just having a really hard time i'm having a really hard time
[9842.08 --> 9849.12]  meshing these things together like universal studios japan even compared to a disney park
[9849.12 --> 9857.68]  um so i've been to disneyland i've been to disney world so much of what's there is not rides it's like
[9857.68 --> 9864.32]  just stuff to buy um and that's a really bad thing about the disney parks but it just feels
[9864.32 --> 9874.72]  it feels even more like that here um and so yeah so i'm just i'm i'm struggling a little bit uh it's
[9875.28 --> 9884.64]  it's it's it's known for its food in in a big way um but i would say that compared to compared to taiwan
[9884.64 --> 9893.20]  i cannot rely on just kind of any random hole in the wall just being awesome uh taiwan food
[9893.20 --> 9902.08]  there's much more like home more like home there's a there's a huge disparity between good food and
[9902.08 --> 9907.68]  like really bad food like there's stuff here that's just really gross like really awful just objectively
[9907.68 --> 9919.28]  terrible um i i i find it very i find it very and i find there are there are experiences that are
[9919.28 --> 9925.52]  quite hyped here that are sort of disconnected from that sort of cultural value of food like the pokemon
[9925.52 --> 9935.84]  cafe is rated i think four and a half stars pokemon cafe uh tokyo we managed to get a reservation after
[9935.84 --> 9943.20]  uh four nights in a row of either me or yvonne or both of us staying up till two in the morning to be
[9943.20 --> 9950.80]  there the second that they that they open up uh reservations each day oh we could have like made
[9950.80 --> 9960.24]  something for you uh well look even if i was willing to bought i would never admit to it okay it doesn't
[9960.24 --> 9967.52]  matter the point is it was it was very difficult to get a reservation we did get a reservation here um
[9967.52 --> 9974.00]  pokemon cafe oh for crying out loud how do i just find this on no i have to go to google maps and then
[9974.00 --> 9979.04]  i have to search for it because sure that makes sense i think it's four and a half stars though i think
[9979.04 --> 9988.88]  it's rated four and a half stars so we we got we got our reservation and i gotta say um it was
[9988.88 --> 10002.80]  terrible 4.3 stars uh the food was largely inedible um the drink that i got was uh like a milk i just i
[10002.80 --> 10008.96]  got a milk tea i was like they can't possibly screw this up except probably about the top third of it
[10008.96 --> 10016.16]  was that fake fake whipped cream like the petroleum byproduct that's yeah that's not worth even having
[10016.16 --> 10025.12]  all cream yeah it was it was disgusting i couldn't drink it um so i thought i thought i had been to
[10025.12 --> 10030.48]  pokemon cafe so i think vaughn might have asked me something about it but now in googling i had gone to
[10030.48 --> 10038.56]  pikachu sweets by pokemon cafe not pokemon cafe okay i thought they were the same thing as the pokemon cafe
[10038.56 --> 10049.84]  is basically terrible the pokemon cafe is basically terrible terrible food um the pictures kind of
[10049.84 --> 10061.04]  rushed in and rushed out uh there's an opportunity to buy merch um it's definitely cute like this like the
[10061.04 --> 10068.64]  the the the pikachu shaped rice is cute but like little things were just awful like the um the the the
[10068.64 --> 10078.00]  the not the nacho chip that is pikachu's tail the lake um uh the kind of toasted nacho chip that is
[10078.00 --> 10085.20]  pikachu's tail in the rice dish it was stale all of them were stale uh we had we had a couple of them at
[10085.20 --> 10093.12]  our table uh they were stale um we went to the pom pom purrin cafe not even really knowing what that
[10093.12 --> 10097.68]  is it's like some hello kitty character but it was you know seemed cute that was the first one we went
[10097.68 --> 10107.44]  to so we didn't know yet that these themed cafes are just terrible terrible food yeah and decor that is
[10107.44 --> 10115.12]  themed after some character um so it's just it's really weird to see how much you can pay for really
[10115.12 --> 10123.76]  really awful food somewhere where supposedly like food culture is a huge thing so i guess food culture
[10123.76 --> 10128.80]  is a huge thing unless you put kind of a cute skin on it and then it doesn't matter it could be actual
[10128.80 --> 10133.20]  garbage just shoveled onto a plate as long as it's an acute shape um
[10133.20 --> 10142.32]  um so that's so so back to my question confusing to me what's been good
[10145.36 --> 10148.24]  getting getting ladies to enjoy traveling vacation is hard
[10150.16 --> 10155.52]  people are like these are classic tourist traps guys they were mostly full of people speaking japanese
[10155.52 --> 10161.20]  there was there was almost the pokemon cafe i'd say was the most touristy one but like the pom pom
[10161.20 --> 10168.96]  purin cafe was full of japanese people um and maybe they were they maybe were there from another part
[10168.96 --> 10172.40]  of japan like you can there's such a thing as domestic tourism that's totally a thing
[10173.84 --> 10183.84]  but um yeah objectively bad um we did this like ninja experience cafe that was really fun for the kids
[10183.84 --> 10190.56]  i'd say they've overall all had a good time i um i have serious reservations about some of the animal
[10190.56 --> 10196.32]  cafes we've done like we did an owl cafe where you get to like hold an owl perched on your arm there were
[10196.32 --> 10204.96]  a lot of owls in there um you know was it a fun experience for the kids a great photo op absolutely
[10206.56 --> 10213.12]  do i feel good having supported that particular business practice honestly not really uh
[10213.12 --> 10224.00]  thinking um trying to think yeah we went to a cat cafe where the cats honestly didn't seem like
[10224.00 --> 10230.16]  mistreated in any way but they were bored as heck like they were they were they were checked out they
[10230.16 --> 10235.52]  were not down to play or interact or anything so i just left them alone which seems to be what they
[10235.52 --> 10242.40]  wanted uh i mean that's probably if i was a little cat in a cat cafe that's probably what i would want
[10243.12 --> 10248.88]  okay what's been good has it been good there's here's here's another major disconnect in japan
[10248.88 --> 10255.28]  is this is a super sort of high-tech high-tech society right um you can get almost anything
[10256.48 --> 10263.28]  through automation like we we did one of those conveyor belt sushi places um so you just order
[10263.28 --> 10267.44]  everything by ipad and it just whips along a conveyor belt to your to your table and you just kind of
[10267.44 --> 10273.52]  dump your dirty plates down the thing uh totally amazing and then we went to ride the bullet train
[10273.52 --> 10279.76]  and we bought our ticket at the terminal and uh we got some food and we ate and then we went to go
[10279.76 --> 10287.04]  onto the platform and to scan our ticket and they're like oh no no you you need the basic fare and your
[10287.04 --> 10294.24]  ticket and i'm like that one's so weird there i have one so weird i have my past though it says i need it
[10294.24 --> 10300.16]  it says i need a pass mo here's my pass mo so i tried to scan my pass mo and here's my ticket they're
[10300.16 --> 10310.24]  like uh uh uh uh no you need a basic fare and i'm like okay so like at the machine no no you cannot buy
[10310.24 --> 10319.20]  the basic fare at the same machine where you buy your bullet train ticket sucked for the place you you
[10319.20 --> 10324.96]  have to go and line so we missed our train that we had that we had scheduled for and like they took
[10324.96 --> 10333.36]  care of it but as i was standing in the line as i was standing in the line to talk to an agent in order
[10333.36 --> 10341.36]  to get the the half of the ticket that i needed all of these agents working at the speed of light
[10341.36 --> 10344.24]  trying to get these people processed i'm sitting here going
[10344.24 --> 10353.12]  why was any of this necessary how about i just tell you where i am and where i'm trying to go to
[10353.76 --> 10359.36]  and you just tell me how much that costs and you print the ticket why are there two tickets so the
[10359.36 --> 10364.24]  way it works is you get two tickets and you slide both tickets into the machine at the same time
[10365.12 --> 10370.16]  and you can you can load your pass mo but instead of just being money
[10370.16 --> 10377.04]  the the way that the the the pat you have to specifically load the basic fare at the counter
[10377.04 --> 10389.52]  onto your pass mo card and it's like why really though why i bought my seat reservation and i have
[10389.52 --> 10396.96]  money what difference does it make and why can this not be done at the same automatic terminal that i bought
[10396.96 --> 10404.56]  my seat reservation at it makes absolutely no sense and so just the the the the the lengths
[10405.28 --> 10414.16]  that some japanese organizations and businesses and individuals will go to automate and make things
[10414.16 --> 10423.68]  high-tech and then you'll turn around and something will be done in a manual way for no possible
[10423.68 --> 10430.48]  explainable explainable reason it's just such a it's such a bizarre disconnect to me like the amount
[10430.48 --> 10438.40]  of micromanagement of lines at the theme park we went to um oh my god oh oh universal studios okay this
[10438.40 --> 10444.24]  is amazing so we bought the express ticket and as you go into the express line they will have you
[10444.88 --> 10450.16]  um they will have you bring up your express ticket but they don't have a scanner for it they don't have a
[10450.16 --> 10458.08]  scanner for the qr code um so what they want you to do is bring up the ticket on your phone and and
[10458.08 --> 10463.52]  zoom in on it zoom in on it so they can read and make sure you have an express ticket for that ride
[10465.12 --> 10470.64]  then so that takes a while because they check that for every individual in your party so we had seven
[10470.64 --> 10476.64]  people so you have someone standing at the entry to the express lineup manually reading your ticket like
[10476.64 --> 10481.60]  with with their eyes reading it there's qr codes all over it there's four qr codes one on every
[10481.60 --> 10487.36]  corner never mind that a single larger qr code might have worked a little bit better whatever okay
[10488.64 --> 10495.44]  then you make your way into the line and before you get on the ride at some point in the line someone
[10495.44 --> 10504.08]  comes along with a scanner and scans your qr code why why did both of those checkpoints exist
[10504.08 --> 10510.48]  there's nowhere for you to get out of that line it could have easily been at the very beginning of
[10510.48 --> 10515.20]  that line that they could have done that or they could just not bother and they could let you stand
[10515.20 --> 10521.36]  in the line and then they could check it there or or they could have a system where their back end
[10522.08 --> 10527.04]  sees that you've scanned it once at that one and then scanned it again at the other thing
[10527.04 --> 10531.44]  or whatever there's absolutely no reason for someone with their human eyes to be reading text
[10532.00 --> 10536.40]  on a thing on my phone when i could have scanned a qr code when there was no way for me to activate
[10536.40 --> 10540.88]  any of this without my phone and without the qr code with it's the exact same ticket that has the
[10540.88 --> 10548.72]  qr code on it that has the text they're reading you guys ever wonder how he why to product reviewing um
[10548.72 --> 10558.72]  okay so okay so so far we're 0 for 3 uh what's a what's a good what's a good thing
[10559.84 --> 10564.00]  what's something you've enjoyed have you gone to the thing i recommended yet
[10564.00 --> 10570.56]  last so you've enjoyed the kids are having a lot of fun um we went to the art installation it was
[10570.56 --> 10578.00]  pretty cool um ah i got a pretty cool i that's honestly i i was i i thought you would either come
[10578.00 --> 10585.28]  out and try to flame me for it because you hated it and i was gonna have to uh fight you um or you
[10585.28 --> 10590.72]  were gonna do that i knew you weren't gonna be like it was awesome but i i'll count that as a win
[10590.72 --> 10597.52]  he thought it was pretty cool so you've heard everything so far for mario i i was positive
[10597.52 --> 10603.04]  on super nintendo world they had you said it's uh it's just a mercantile experience
[10605.68 --> 10610.88]  it's just to sell you stuff it's incredible bowser's castle i honestly i would have still
[10610.88 --> 10615.28]  i would have still gone in just to walk through the castle okay that's cool that's cool
[10615.28 --> 10623.68]  that's cool it it is it is beautifully crafted every square inch of it has had more care put into
[10623.68 --> 10629.52]  it than most you know grade 10 students would put into a homework assignment they have to hand in like
[10629.52 --> 10639.44]  it's it's absolutely unbelievable um i also couldn't i was blown away by the i i'm i'm just saying this
[10639.44 --> 10644.96]  this is just the level of care and attention grade 10 school homework though really might not get a lot
[10644.96 --> 10653.04]  of care i'm saying per square inch though per square inch luke okay okay all right for square inch
[10653.84 --> 10661.28]  um i i've been i've been kind of blown away by the sort of the enthusiasm of just you know the average
[10661.92 --> 10668.40]  yeah that part is very cool actually what motivating factors are there it has a bit of a stepford
[10668.40 --> 10674.24]  wives like if i don't keep this job i'm going to die kind of vibe to it but okay i didn't get that
[10674.24 --> 10680.96]  i definitely appreciate being goaded upon i it to me it just felt like people were proud of their work
[10680.96 --> 10687.52]  regardless of what their work was that's the vibe that i got i bet there's some of that yeah which is
[10687.52 --> 10697.52]  good uh okay so kids are having a good time super nintendo land was a uh the trains impressive
[10697.52 --> 10705.44]  experience other than some like small stupid things like trying to catch the o loop line from um
[10707.12 --> 10713.36]  uh i don't know whatever whatever major station we were at there inexplicably there's just no signs for
[10713.36 --> 10721.44]  it um and then there's another line that uses the same color code that is not the o line okay so the
[10721.44 --> 10727.52]  reason why i laughed so hard at that is because i i guarantee you i know exactly where you were
[10727.52 --> 10732.88]  standing when you got really frustrated about the o line because i stood there for a couple minutes
[10732.88 --> 10737.84]  ranting to my brother about how the signage is so good the whole time and then you get to this one
[10737.84 --> 10743.68]  spot with all these pillars is is that where you were maybe i don't know we might have been at a
[10743.68 --> 10748.16]  different station there's all these pillars and the signs just get screwed up and it's there's no way to
[10748.16 --> 10752.24]  really tell and then you have to walk a little bit with no guidance and then you can find your
[10752.24 --> 10756.24]  way to the o line properly again and then yeah there's two lines with the same color i ended up
[10756.24 --> 10760.00]  figuring out the same color thing is because there's two companies that run the trains
[10762.00 --> 10767.44]  sure so so it's not really brilliant it gets which gets kind of weird but yeah that's funny that you had
[10767.44 --> 10771.76]  those two complaints because i ran into exactly those two things but yeah the more local trains are
[10771.76 --> 10777.44]  pretty easy once you start getting it um but yeah the the two tickets for the the high-speed bullet
[10777.44 --> 10786.80]  trains is where i can yeah aj save oh yeah yeah yeah yeah is that shin osaka and it was just like
[10786.80 --> 10793.68]  this is i just got to a complete dead end of signage and i'm like okay yeah it's weird it's weird i just
[10793.68 --> 10799.20]  had to wander around and find it if you add like one to two signs it would solve the whole problem
[10799.20 --> 10805.52]  it's just so odd apparently aj ran into the same problems too and there were signs that just should have
[10806.32 --> 10812.16]  obviously indicated where to go you know where they could have just had another line right there that's
[10812.16 --> 10816.80]  like yeah if you're trying to get to the to the loop line here's totally all the other ones but not that
[10816.80 --> 10823.12]  one right direction catching the loop line in the right direction threw us for a loop last night because
[10823.12 --> 10829.84]  you can't just say hold on they you can't just say it goes to this station because there's no terminus
[10829.84 --> 10835.36]  station so figuring out the direction is kind of tough because both ways technically go everywhere
[10835.36 --> 10840.24]  and instead of them just saying what the next one it goes to is they pick a couple of major ones along
[10840.24 --> 10845.92]  the line uh so we almost got on the wrong uh train going the wrong way it was a whole thing we we made it
[10845.92 --> 10852.96]  though we got stuffed onto it so okay well how much longer are you there for
[10855.60 --> 10862.64]  uh a couple more days but like look i mean travel's not really my thing i i also don't like seafood
[10863.68 --> 10873.44]  um which is sort of a drag in japan um that's fair you know my kids are into it so i can't just go for
[10873.44 --> 10881.44]  kobe every night um you know get that wagyu would you even watch do you like wagyu i'm not i'm not
[10881.44 --> 10889.60]  into it personally i like meteor meats yeah i don't know it's um i it's i'm just i'm happy that you at
[10889.60 --> 10894.32]  least had some experiences that you liked because i know you don't really like traveling and you enjoying
[10894.32 --> 10899.60]  something that isn't like uh you know putting a box somewhere and plugging cables into it is good
[10899.60 --> 10907.20]  look we're we're we're here for the kids and they are having a really good time and that's
[10908.08 --> 10916.32]  that's good that's got value what's uh what's like what's we have lost your voice yeah when your voice
[10916.32 --> 10919.44]  comes back what's little man's favorite thing been so far
[10927.52 --> 10932.88]  okay well if this is potentially going to take a bit to get his voice back maybe if we can find a
[10932.88 --> 10939.52]  merch message for me while he works on that and keep the show flowing i can do that let me just move my monitor over here
[10939.52 --> 10954.24]  um it's just technical difficulties can luke reply to this yeah uh what's up hey how's it going uh i have
[10954.24 --> 10960.48]  found that in in anno uh in visa is really complicated because of the irrigation systems
[10960.48 --> 10966.00]  and i'm working on uh you know increasing the efficiencies of my water runs there you go
[10966.00 --> 10971.76]  issue i have i have yes welcome back line up and yeah linus is really hard there's my there's
[10971.76 --> 10976.24]  i bought it when it was on sale when when linus said and i'm i was like okay i can't play this game
[10976.24 --> 10983.12]  i know 1800 i'm never gonna stop yeah linus and i played and i had forgotten we played recently and i
[10983.12 --> 10988.24]  had forgotten kind of a lot of the basics of the game but also realized like all the things that i did when
[10988.24 --> 10993.36]  we played were really simple and linus is doing all the hard stuff so i want to skill up so i started
[10993.36 --> 10998.64]  playing single player and i was like holy crap uh but i've gotten a lot better which is good oh really
[10998.64 --> 11003.76]  yeah that's pretty funny i know like trade routes now i've done like multi-point trade routes and like
[11003.76 --> 11009.84]  all this other stuff so like yeah oh i will be better now i've actually gotten way more into it by doing
[11009.84 --> 11018.16]  that is every time you um every time you build a world you will reach a new level of citizens
[11018.16 --> 11023.28]  and you're gonna be like oh everything i did before was wrong and everything is destroyed now
[11023.28 --> 11030.72]  i have to have to you have to plan my so many stages in advance the reason that i was like okay
[11030.72 --> 11036.16]  well i'm never going to be able to stop playing this is because the friction for undoing everything
[11036.16 --> 11041.68]  that you had already done is like nothing it's pretty low if you play on the easy difficulty it's
[11041.68 --> 11046.88]  pretty low yeah it's high on the higher it's way less than pretty much anything else i've touched
[11047.52 --> 11052.40]  yeah yeah i i i had that feeling linus because i was playing i thought i was like doing pretty well
[11052.40 --> 11061.12]  and then i unlocked uh oil and i was just like oh yeah what what do you mean i can't have the train
[11061.12 --> 11065.60]  track run on the road i that means i can't get to the harbor because all the houses are in the way i
[11065.60 --> 11075.44]  i yeah that that sucked um but anyways start over um okay so you're you're back yeah what was uh what's
[11075.44 --> 11077.28]  uh little man's favorite thing been so far
[11080.08 --> 11080.32]  uh
[11083.52 --> 11087.76]  i don't know he's kind of uh he's kind of enjoyed a lot of stuff i'd have to i'd have to ask him
[11088.72 --> 11092.96]  i haven't really done the the post trip what was your favorite thing yet not not actually post
[11092.96 --> 11097.76]  trip yet so that makes sense all right fair enough maybe we should just flow into merch messages
[11099.76 --> 11103.36]  yeah we should go through them pretty quick though because i think i gotta run pretty quick
[11103.36 --> 11110.40]  okay sounds good okay i'll work on potentials um recently started playing through the halo
[11110.40 --> 11114.32]  ce campaign with my eldest any proud dad gaming milestones
[11114.32 --> 11123.92]  uh yeah i i curated this one it was uh when uh when my son beat me at towerfall not because i'm
[11123.92 --> 11129.04]  some kind of expert towerfall player or because he is either but because it's a pretty pure skill
[11129.04 --> 11135.76]  placed game or based game and he like beat me he won he's beat lube too fair and square and multiple
[11135.76 --> 11144.24]  times actually yep yep yeah it wasn't a fluke nope it does have like a strong rubber band built in um
[11145.20 --> 11150.40]  but you still have to win it's not like luke and i didn't benefit from it too you still win 100
[11151.84 --> 11158.64]  because of the doj lawsuit do you see apple ever making an app for airpods for android like they do
[11158.64 --> 11167.36]  with beats products no but the fact that they exist for beats products which use the same chip
[11167.36 --> 11173.44]  shows you how easily apple could have it exist they just choose not to hey dll i'm too young to
[11173.44 --> 11179.84]  remember doj vs microsoft but how is microsoft still getting away with aggressively bundling edge
[11179.84 --> 11182.64]  after the ruling that they couldn't bundle internet explorer
[11182.64 --> 11187.44]  edge is pretty easy to get around these days for 20 years also that
[11190.00 --> 11195.04]  wake up hello dot dll privacy is dead as someone who wants to keep what
[11200.24 --> 11205.60]  privacy is dead as someone who wants to keep what little is left of my privacy how did you learn to
[11205.60 --> 11217.52]  let go becoming a public figure i didn't really have a choice i um i just i realized that it came with
[11217.52 --> 11225.28]  the territory and uh once the tea was or the milk was spilt um it was there's no way to unspill it i
[11227.60 --> 11233.04]  so it is what it is there's some stuff like it's a lot easier for me but i definitely have a lot of
[11233.04 --> 11238.48]  things that are not public um but it takes significantly more to secure them that way
[11240.00 --> 11250.96]  yeah unfortunately i did the um i did the go-karting in uh in tokyo thing oh yeah that didn't interest me
[11250.96 --> 11260.48]  i didn't do that did you like that um you were right yeah it was oh it's like you're in a car
[11260.48 --> 11269.68]  you are but you're not yeah and you you don't even even remotely um
[11272.08 --> 11280.32]  sort of test the limits of the pretty slow kind of boring carts yep you just kind of drive in formation
[11280.32 --> 11285.92]  um very very carefully uh sounds about right yeah
[11288.40 --> 11294.00]  yep it was uh it was something i mean again massive credit to the people working there they were very
[11294.00 --> 11301.04]  enthusiastic and fun and i i'd say you know what i i realize i sound like kind of a hater so far
[11301.04 --> 11311.28]  my highlight is um that one crepe i had the first night at a mall it was so good crepes are apparently
[11311.28 --> 11315.36]  a thing here the second one i had made me feel they are they had fake whipped cream in it the first one
[11315.36 --> 11320.08]  had fake cream and it was it was outstanding or it's a fake cream fresh cream the first one had fresh
[11320.08 --> 11324.32]  cream and it was outstanding uh and the people the people are the people are the highlight for me
[11324.32 --> 11334.16]  fantastic yeah everyone's super nice yep it's interesting because they're super nice
[11336.64 --> 11345.84]  but also open and like it's relatively clear that they want you here um but for a little bit and then
[11345.84 --> 11354.00]  you should go home it's like all right fair enough i like that that's they never like say that but the
[11354.00 --> 11358.56]  vibe is like fairly clearly communicated they're very happier there they're very polite they're
[11358.56 --> 11364.96]  very friendly very good but also it's like there's some amount of like now it's time to leave
[11364.96 --> 11371.92]  yeah that was fun thank you yeah yeah which is fine totally fine it's just uh yeah there's no
[11371.92 --> 11375.60]  there's no sugar put on it you know there's a there's a saying in england would you like
[11375.60 --> 11380.08]  another cup of tea before you leave which is great
[11380.08 --> 11389.60]  that's pretty good yeah it's pretty good it's really effective uh anyway big l i have no idea
[11389.60 --> 11395.20]  who this is for have you found a good wireless solution for the valve index i was hoping the
[11395.20 --> 11401.20]  nofio wireless adapter would be good but it seems to be having post-launch issues
[11402.88 --> 11408.88]  i will be trying that one very soon i've had mine for a few weeks and i have no excuses other than just
[11408.88 --> 11413.12]  i have a lot going on for why i haven't tried it yet i'm really looking forward to trying it but
[11413.12 --> 11417.20]  to my knowledge that's the only one so it's either good or it's bad
[11419.68 --> 11425.28]  hi dll particularly big l everybody's big i'm almost finished with my teaching degree and always
[11425.28 --> 11432.32]  struggling helping students with dyslexia is there anything you do or is anything you do or your
[11432.32 --> 11438.88]  teachers did that really helped you love the show uh i don't know how much people are gonna like this
[11438.88 --> 11442.80]  one of my teachers in particular uh a physics teacher that i had i won't name him just in
[11442.80 --> 11449.20]  case he doesn't want who knows times have changed um but he gave a short talk very short talk at one
[11449.20 --> 11455.52]  point in time um not to me but i was able to overhear it from another student who had some uh learning
[11455.52 --> 11463.92]  disabilities and he was basically the person was basically asking for uh i think it was like easier
[11463.92 --> 11469.44]  marking or something i don't remember exactly what it was and he effectively said no and was like i'm
[11469.44 --> 11477.68]  happy to try to give you more attention i'm happy to try to help you but this is how it's gonna be
[11478.48 --> 11484.00]  once you're out of here so you got to figure it out and whether you have to unfortunately you know
[11484.00 --> 11488.72]  study longer or do whatever put in more effort than other people that's just how it's gonna be
[11488.72 --> 11493.60]  so you should start practicing that now effectively um and i heard the same thing because i always
[11493.60 --> 11502.72]  struggled with reading and was like well okay um so i generally did i've somewhat like brute forced the
[11502.72 --> 11507.68]  the the reading stuff where i've tried to get a lot better at kind of guessing what the word is when
[11507.68 --> 11513.28]  my brain starts messing it up and you'll see me stumble sometimes it happens on wanshow
[11513.28 --> 11519.84]  literally every show um so you might notice it uh it happened during the sponsor reads it happened
[11519.84 --> 11525.20]  during multiple topics today it happens all the time um i have a significantly harder time reading
[11525.20 --> 11530.72]  text than just speaking and honestly i'm not even that great at just speaking um so yeah i don't know
[11530.72 --> 11536.80]  it's it'll be hard but it's not impossible you can figure it out um and keep pushing there are
[11536.80 --> 11543.04]  tricks out there you can find fonts um in my experience the fonts are not universal one font
[11543.04 --> 11547.44]  that works for one person doesn't work perfectly for another person and vice versa but there's a lot of
[11547.44 --> 11552.80]  them so you might be able to find one that works better for you um that's really the only tool i can
[11552.80 --> 11559.28]  suggest to you that won't help you read textbooks that aren't digitized that won't help you um read
[11559.28 --> 11566.24]  signs i don't know things like that um but it might help you if you can digitize a textbook or if you can get
[11566.24 --> 11570.16]  something into a digital form you might be able to convert the font and read it easier that way
[11570.16 --> 11574.96]  um there's other like speed reading tools that i've found that helped me like one of them only
[11574.96 --> 11579.28]  shows one word at a time and it just rapidly flashes through them and for some reason that works for me
[11580.80 --> 11585.84]  but you won't always be in an environment or a scenario where you can read that way so i think it's better to
[11585.84 --> 11595.76]  find whatever works best for you for me personally learning how to read without those things has been
[11595.76 --> 11602.72]  more beneficial um even though i i do struggle more than if i didn't it's just it's like the same reason
[11602.72 --> 11607.68]  why i never went dvorak on my keyboard i never went to vorak on my keyboard despite thinking that it might
[11607.68 --> 11612.48]  be better because i'm like well i'm gonna have to use other keyboards and that's gonna be super annoying
[11612.48 --> 11618.24]  so i'd rather just stay with qwerty and be used to qwerty so that when i use other things i'm still
[11618.24 --> 11624.48]  in flow and it's still good so i don't know someone said so basically get good yeah kinda it sucks but
[11624.48 --> 11631.20]  like this is what it is and instead of just like feeling bad all the time just fight through it you'll
[11631.20 --> 11637.84]  be fine you're gonna make it you're gonna be okay yeah excellent
[11637.84 --> 11644.88]  hey dll love the podcast i would love to hear your opinion on the overabundance of scam
[11644.88 --> 11650.88]  ads that play in front of almost every video on youtube now should google be held liable for any
[11650.88 --> 11651.68]  money stolen
[11656.64 --> 11664.56]  i do think that platforms should have some responsibility for anything that is an officially
[11664.56 --> 11674.08]  sanctioned piece of content that somebody sees i don't know how to enforce that uh but it is
[11674.08 --> 11678.48]  pretty clear to me that something needs to be done because it's an enormous problem
[11678.48 --> 11681.20]  and it can't be on anyone other than google to address it
[11681.20 --> 11693.60]  let's see what else hi dilla linus do you still use plex are you considering changing to a competitor
[11693.60 --> 11701.76]  and what do you recommend to stream movies in your home i do still use plex i am strongly considering
[11701.76 --> 11708.88]  switching to a competitor i it's been i think a year and a half since i last communicated with them
[11708.88 --> 11714.64]  and told them hey we're not going to do any more promotional activities for you guys until you fix
[11714.64 --> 11720.24]  basic functionality that is advertised as part of your product and the basic functionality in question
[11720.24 --> 11730.16]  for me was um loading transcoded versions of my media library onto my device to take with me on the plane
[11731.12 --> 11737.76]  in the lead up to this trip i tried across three different android four four different android
[11737.76 --> 11748.56]  devices to load media and it was an absolute crap show um just errored out transcodes failed downloads
[11748.56 --> 11755.68]  across a variety of different versions of android from new to old to samsung to not samsung um
[11756.40 --> 11765.76]  it's clear that they basically don't care at all and um just do not respect their users enough
[11765.76 --> 11773.36]  to follow through on features that are supposed to be part of their product um
[11778.24 --> 11787.12]  yeah i uh i i don't i don't know what to say other than that their leadership is clearly laser focused on
[11787.12 --> 11796.16]  becoming a uh a streaming service for licensed content and uh is treating the users that got them to
[11796.16 --> 11803.92]  where they are as second class citizens no this is not a server-side configurer this is a widespread issue
[11805.76 --> 11810.88]  widespread and has been for years years and years and years and years
[11810.88 --> 11819.28]  uh hello from pax sad you guys aren't here linus how would you react if you caught your son cheating
[11819.28 --> 11825.60]  in an online game would you differentiate between an in-game exploit versus third-party software
[11828.32 --> 11833.84]  oh i'd be i'd be mad um i do do probably probably probably lose his gaming purposes for a bit
[11833.84 --> 11843.04]  uh in-game exploit versus cheating though yeah cheating very very very bad in-game exploit i'd
[11843.04 --> 11848.88]  probably tell him it's rude kind of like how you know in badminton i'll see him flick serve a novice
[11849.60 --> 11854.48]  and i'll be like hey that's rude you know don't do that it's not about winning the point it's about
[11854.48 --> 11860.24]  playing the game um sometimes don't forget if you're playing against someone who's on the same level as
[11860.24 --> 11867.20]  you or someone who's better than you by all means employ every possible strategy to win
[11867.20 --> 11872.64]  but if you're playing against someone who is already at a significant disadvantage that's fair you don't
[11872.64 --> 11875.76]  take shortcuts yeah yeah that's fair
[11879.52 --> 11887.04]  my flowplane sub just renewed so happy one year since the hackening for luke i'm a new tech manager
[11887.04 --> 11893.36]  how do you keep oh boy now it's everywhere how do you keep a fully remote team engaged and motivated
[11893.36 --> 11901.60]  what helps you help them to be successful uh it's actually genuinely tough i think what helps it is
[11901.60 --> 11912.32]  honestly not necessarily um me or maybe it's me in the hiring process but a lot of the people on the
[11912.32 --> 11919.12]  team are just motivated people and honestly uh this might suck for the remote work crowd because i've
[11919.12 --> 11928.16]  been a i've been a i've been a public you know pro on that side but not everyone can do it um the people
[11928.16 --> 11932.96]  that i have in general i think can there's been blips here there but there's blips here and there with
[11932.96 --> 11938.88]  every form of employment so i don't think it's been any worse than any local working um i've seen
[11938.88 --> 11944.96]  intrinsic motivation drop with people who work in office as well but a bunch of people would not be
[11944.96 --> 11951.36]  able to stay on task stay focused stay productive etc etc etc with remote work some people can my teams
[11951.36 --> 11957.20]  can and have proven that they can multiple times so i'm happy with that but some people might just not
[11957.20 --> 11964.24]  be built for it and that isn't necessarily on you as a leader you might just need to move that person on
[11964.24 --> 11968.64]  so that they can go work somewhere else if if working locally is not an option at your company
[11968.64 --> 11977.28]  or whatever else um but like yeah aj's in the chat right now speaking of remote workers i i had to yell
[11977.28 --> 11982.40]  at him on in his first week off because someone posted a task that needed to be done in the infrastructure
[11982.40 --> 11989.20]  chat and then he just did it before i could get to it and i had to be like hey stop it was so fast too
[11989.20 --> 12000.40]  that it was too fast stop being so competent he's too confident so i don't think motivation is like
[12000.40 --> 12005.44]  that i mean it again it's it becomes everyone has like burnout motivation problems every now and then
[12005.44 --> 12009.04]  especially when you work with people for a really long period of time they're gonna do this it's okay
[12009.04 --> 12014.96]  but i don't think in general that's an issue with my team um i think it has been and i have dealt with
[12014.96 --> 12021.36]  oh pocky nice i think it has been and i've dealt with that usually by trying to work with that
[12021.36 --> 12027.28]  person to find ways to motivate them or in some situations uh by moving them on to to some other
[12027.28 --> 12033.44]  form of work by exiting them from the company or their contract or whatever else um he has notifications
[12033.44 --> 12039.92]  off too wow so he manually checked it geez um so i don't know i try to do things like our our
[12040.72 --> 12044.96]  our meetings for the week we we have them longer than they need to be so people can have like
[12044.96 --> 12049.12]  water cooler style talk which i encourage but also try to cut off at a certain point
[12050.72 --> 12057.28]  and i try to have some some much more relaxed uh channels in slack where people can talk about like
[12057.28 --> 12062.24]  oh what games they're playing or music or whatever else so that you try to build a culture because one of
[12062.24 --> 12068.72]  the biggest problems with remote teams is you never build a culture um and that's actually a problem so
[12068.72 --> 12072.80]  there's a bit of a fine line where you want to encourage it but you also don't want people
[12073.36 --> 12078.56]  uh to partake way too much because especially with a robot team you're probably in different time zones
[12078.56 --> 12082.24]  so someone's going to be off playing games wanting to talk about games while someone else is in the
[12082.24 --> 12087.44]  middle of their work day and that's a notification that's coming in work chat so it's it's funky but
[12087.44 --> 12091.12]  you gotta play the line i don't know i'm gonna stop talking before i talk for hours
[12091.12 --> 12098.00]  uh what are your thoughts on the trend of putting titanium in everything
[12100.40 --> 12106.40]  put more titanium in my body i don't know titanium is pretty cool titanium seems pretty cool to me too
[12107.92 --> 12114.96]  please don't break things please uh i got a potential here there you go linus and luke with
[12114.96 --> 12121.12]  everything you've accomplished with lmg are you satisfied have you satisfied a specific childhood
[12121.12 --> 12131.12]  dream or are planning to um no i wanted to be a cop when i was a kid that tracks i was just like
[12132.40 --> 12136.32]  and then later i wanted to be a teacher when i say i wanted to be a cop when i was a kid i mean
[12136.32 --> 12141.52]  when i was in like grade two yeah i wanted to be an astronaut yeah those are the only jobs you know
[12141.52 --> 12150.88]  yeah yeah firefighter cop exactly doctor yeah doctor yeah that's good and so i basically
[12150.88 --> 12154.80]  i basically just became a teacher but without a degree and with way more students
[12154.80 --> 12166.32]  you found the loophole oh no you won't get in trouble for dick jokes yeah he will still get in
[12166.32 --> 12173.44]  trouble for dick jokes yeah i mean i can still get in trouble uh i wanted to work at a game dev studio
[12174.00 --> 12179.92]  but with how everything's been going i feel like i dodged a bullet on that one oh yeah you did but yeah
[12179.92 --> 12188.32]  oh my god at its core good money for a while for a while yeah um at its core i wanted to kind of
[12189.76 --> 12195.84]  be the communication line between uh like business people and developers so that is legitimately a
[12195.84 --> 12201.68]  conversation that i had with my dad um that he remembers in like late high school where i was like
[12201.68 --> 12206.72]  i feel like this would be a good thing for me and then i literally ended up doing that so that part has
[12206.72 --> 12215.36]  worked out ltt making games ltt has technically made multiple games actually um ltt made linus jump
[12215.36 --> 12221.04]  not rob an actually very fun game that we should probably just release at some point um because it
[12221.04 --> 12226.16]  doesn't seem like we're going to use it anymore but it was used for the verified gamer program luke
[12227.36 --> 12233.12]  we should go back to the old way we'll make it a mobile game for like a dollar a dollar
[12233.12 --> 12241.52]  yeah it definitely wasn't built for mobile but we could probably figure it out i don't know how
[12241.52 --> 12245.28]  hard it would be to adapt and honestly if i told this to the person who made it they would probably
[12245.28 --> 12251.92]  just do it um so i would just make it nine by sixteen do not take that as instructions to do that please
[12253.04 --> 12260.56]  uh yeah and all or two dollars whatever jaden's sweating in his sleep yeah i would not make i would
[12260.56 --> 12264.96]  not make jane do it he's also not the one that made the game so it's okay um we've also made other
[12264.96 --> 12270.80]  games you know what we should do are you allowed to make a game are you allowed to make a game one
[12270.80 --> 12278.64]  cent so that uh google transaction transaction fees every time someone buys it i honestly don't know um
[12278.64 --> 12282.48]  the apps that we've released are are free the full plane app is free because you pay for the
[12282.48 --> 12289.36]  subscription so i don't know apparently yes i don't know if i believe that but we'll see we'll see
[12290.56 --> 12298.80]  you are yes what that's wild you used to be able to okay well we'll see that would literally just
[12298.80 --> 12303.92]  cost them money because of the even if you're like oh but google handles the credit card transactions
[12303.92 --> 12309.20]  yeah but they go through the credit card themselves yeah so they will lose money they
[12309.20 --> 12314.32]  probably have more favorable deals but um i guarantee you it's not that favorable
[12314.32 --> 12321.92]  yeah it also only has one level uh
[12324.48 --> 12327.36]  has a leaderboard did it
[12329.60 --> 12335.20]  i thought so really it's been so long i'm not sure i don't remember i don't think it did
[12336.40 --> 12341.52]  i think we should do every flavor bean i think we had a what yes i think we had a way to look in to
[12341.52 --> 12344.24]  see how fast people had i'm going for i had done it
[12346.88 --> 12352.40]  make more levels yeah but that takes dev time that means it costs money just make chat gpt do it
[12353.60 --> 12362.88]  more level please and then it just outputs the the the brilliant frameworks and the the c javas yeah
[12362.88 --> 12373.04]  one one node javascript please thank you oh yeah i have one more thing about japan that i want to talk
[12373.04 --> 12378.24]  about oh boy you can play i cannot find any connection there it is cost of things and the quality
[12378.24 --> 12390.32]  i have grossly overpaid for mediocrity at best and i have paid almost nothing for amazing quality
[12390.32 --> 12397.12]  have you been in cities the whole time yes because i found when i got out of the big cities that
[12397.12 --> 12403.76]  completely stopped and i think it's uh maybe a touristy thing or like a expensive area versus
[12403.76 --> 12409.76]  cheaper area thing or something um but yeah that that's definitely completely stopped stuff
[12409.76 --> 12414.72]  affordably like i don't remember the last time my entire family had a sit-down meal for about 10
[12414.72 --> 12422.56]  bucks a head but we had the entire bill service fee included was like 56 at this place that was like in
[12422.56 --> 12428.00]  a mall you know like it wasn't nowhere that like it wasn't like even a random home log or not a mall it
[12428.00 --> 12433.04]  was like you know they have these department stores here that are kind of like what we would think of as a
[12433.04 --> 12438.48]  mall but it's more just like a bunch of stores i don't know how to describe it it's slightly different
[12438.48 --> 12446.40]  um but it was like a restaurant essentially is what i'm trying to say um and it was like great and cheap
[12446.40 --> 12452.72]  and then we'll go places where it's like oh that was 30 40 a head and i'm just not really sure where it
[12452.72 --> 12456.72]  went um and it just it there doesn't seem to be a connection there
[12456.72 --> 12464.72]  yeah yeah i was running into i didn't forget anything some of them include a ten dollar
[12464.72 --> 12471.52]  or a 10 service fee i was running into very up and down quality very up and down pricing all of
[12471.52 --> 12476.16]  that type of stuff when i was like in tokyo i didn't go to other major cities um and then when
[12476.16 --> 12483.84]  i got out of that major city and got into smaller towns smaller cities that type of stuff completely no
[12483.84 --> 12490.32]  longer a problem quality on average was much higher um i found personally people are telling
[12490.32 --> 12495.12]  me that just means i was unlucky in tokyo which is fine but i just that's what i experienced uh quality
[12495.12 --> 12502.88]  was really like everything was amazing and cheap out of the city yeti wrangler says that would be true
[12502.88 --> 12508.32]  almost anywhere though no no uh in vancouver everything's expensive whether it's garbage or good
[12508.32 --> 12515.76]  yes so that's the difference every meal is 30 no matter if you're having like a three course greek
[12515.76 --> 12524.96]  meal or going to mcdonald's yeah everywhere yeah yeah and then in taiwan everything's pretty trash cheap
[12524.96 --> 12528.48]  which isn't actually true some of it's really expensive but it's a hyper tourist trash areas
[12528.48 --> 12537.52]  this outro to the show thanks for watching guys see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
