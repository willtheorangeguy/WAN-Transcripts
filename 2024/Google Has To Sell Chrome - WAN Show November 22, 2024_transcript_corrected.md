[0.00 → 9.96] guys today uh what is this the DOJ will try to force google to sell chrome no not like you
[9.96 → 17.20] have to pay for chrome in order to use it like sell the chrome business unit this is freaking
[17.20 → 23.28] wild uh we could also talk about the fight last week or should we call it a show yeah i don't
[23.28 → 27.54] know we're not boxing commentators but like realistically that wasn't a boxing match so
[27.54 → 32.94] that's a good call hey got him okay we're probably not going to talk about that so hold on let
[32.94 → 39.08] me find let me find something else here um i should probably expand on what we said last week or
[39.08 → 46.52] rather expand on why i wasn't able to say more last week about the hiatus i is that the term for
[46.52 → 53.32] multiple hiatuses hiatal whichever one it is Yvonne watched the segment, and she was just like
[53.32 → 58.84] that sucked dude you didn't even like to explain why you can't explain and i was like well i thought
[58.84 → 65.62] it was self-evident, and she was like it wasn't and i was like okay thank you better half i will do
[65.62 → 73.36] better next time i do i understand why you thought that but i also understand why some people might
[73.36 → 80.74] not get it cool let's go uh what else we got today uh we need a puffer shirt the number of people that
[80.74 → 86.38] talk about puffer ever since that segment it's really it's really stayed around um you all don't
[86.38 → 93.26] seem to want actual tech tips yeah question mark no that that seems to be a thing that seems to be a
[93.26 → 96.72] thing we can talk about that we can talk about that also Microsoft Ignite 2024
[96.72 → 102.78] uh things you don't want plus fixing crowd strike nice
[102.78 → 126.22] the show is brought to you by notion
[126.72 → 133.92] Messi server part deals that's a new one and our laptop partner LG our wrap partner brand and of
[133.92 → 138.80] course our chair partner secret lab who sent over new chairs for us yeah they're just like the old
[138.80 → 146.54] chairs but whiter and like soft yeah they have soft armrests yeah which we're both wearing
[146.54 → 151.72] long sleeves because it's like the heat just turned on this morning so it's not actually warm in here i was
[151.72 → 159.92] good they told me to wear this oh which is extremely comfy oh okay but yeah well whatever I'm cold so i
[159.92 → 167.60] actually do need the hoodie why don't we jump right into our headline topic today uh the department of
[167.60 → 176.34] justice will try to force google to sell chrome ban default search deals and license data for 10 years
[176.34 → 184.22] also chrome OS might become android uh so they have uh they've submitted their recommended remedies
[184.22 → 192.24] to judge Amit meta who ruled that google illegally maintains a monopoly on search back in August and
[192.24 → 198.54] these are the recommended remedies so selling their Chrome web browser the DOJ views it as a key
[198.54 → 204.26] component of Google's search monopoly with approximately 65 browser share across all platforms
[204.26 → 210.68] with chromium based browsers accounting for nearly 80 percent of the market however i would push
[210.68 → 218.04] back a little bit a little bit on clumping other chromium based browsers in with the chrome monopoly
[218.04 → 223.92] that's not really their fault well it is, and it isn't the dominance of chrome is what's making
[223.92 → 232.06] a chromium basis so important for maintaining compatibility with the rest of the web and even though Google does not
[232.06 → 240.40] single-handedly develop another chromium based browser they can certainly shove um certain
[240.40 → 245.08] manifest uh they can certainly shove certain um
[245.08 → 255.04] ideas uh along and and and make them difficult to go against even though it is possible in some cases
[255.04 → 260.80] they can attempt to manifest their own optimal business environment oh i like that yeah yeah i like
[260.80 → 267.22] that that's good that's good um so anyway i think that the numbers a little I'm just saying i think the numbers a little fuzzy
[267.22 → 275.30] yeah it's clearly not for sure 65 percent but i also don't think it's 80 percent 80 percent no matter which one of them it is though
[275.30 → 283.94] let's be real that is a dominant position, and it was it is one that google has painstakingly
[283.94 → 298.52] meticulously created and used to their advantage um this is kind of wild the next recommendation is banning google from entering into default search deals
[298.52 → 306.90] which amount to 26 billion dollars annually and might end up hurting Mozilla more than it does google
[306.90 → 315.68] brutally yeah to be clear a lot of that 26 billion is going to apple not to Mozilla but um man this one
[315.68 → 324.38] oh i have kind of i have kind of mixed feelings on the one hand yeah these default search deals are a huge part of
[324.38 → 328.58] why we all tolerate google search because it's just there when we open up our browser
[328.58 → 333.64] with that said if that works then more people would use bing but
[333.64 → 341.58] well or yeah i mean i understand that just still default in windows and bing is definitely still default
[341.58 → 346.76] in edge if the product was that bad i guess people would be willing to switch off of it
[346.76 → 354.10] or maybe that's different platform by platform i mean um this the whole uh switching to iOS experience
[354.10 → 361.74] has definitely opened my eyes to how intuitive doesn't mean intuitive it just means
[361.74 → 369.64] whatever arcane ridiculousness you've personally gotten used to right um and that is true that's
[369.64 → 376.40] true across multiple platforms i mean how is it intuitive to press Ctrl alt delete to access
[376.40 → 382.80] some kind of system menu it's not that's not intuitive doing for a long time exactly so, so intuitive to you
[382.80 → 388.80] specifically exactly so depending on the platform you might find users more or less
[388.80 → 396.30] malleable um, and it's its pretty well established that behaviour across iOS and android users is
[396.30 → 400.64] different for example i remember like years ago this used to get talked about a lot more
[400.64 → 405.90] um, and maybe it's because there was more transparency into the numbers i actually don't know why nobody talks
[405.90 → 412.68] about it anymore but i remember it would make headlines sort of like cyclically that apple users
[412.68 → 418.46] spend way more money yeah on the app store yeah that used to be super common to be talked about i think
[418.46 → 423.92] that was often when there was notable or more notable i would say differences between the apps
[423.92 → 429.36] like i remember people used to be really frustrated because android users had lower image quality on
[429.36 → 435.48] Instagram back in the day yeah yeah that was little things like that um were much more
[435.48 → 440.56] discernible it was you generally had a worse experience on android because android users were seen as
[440.56 → 445.78] like cheap and not worth focusing on development yeah and and and and and and they were yeah to be
[445.78 → 451.00] honest so like that was yeah like very measurably if you don't remember this it was like
[451.00 → 458.70] a huge topic and like a many times multiplier it wasn't like the average android user spends nine
[458.70 → 464.34] percent less on apps compared to the average apple user and this was more of a thing back i would
[464.34 → 470.32] imagine more of a thing back when uh like pretty much every app was like kind of useless unless you
[470.32 → 474.94] spent like two or three dollars like that was what uh that was what a paid app was back in the day it
[474.94 → 482.42] wasn't so many subscription-based services in 2024 the average iPhone user spends 12.77 per app
[482.42 → 487.80] by comparison the average android user spends six dollars and 19 cents so it's still double
[487.80 → 493.90] still double wow okay as far as my understanding goes it was like a much bigger gap in the past but
[493.90 → 498.34] I'm not i don't know 100 right now i don't know if what parkour is saying here is true but if it
[498.34 → 504.88] funny if true uh Snapchat on android was apparently just a screenshot of the camera compared to iOS
[504.88 → 511.78] directly using the camera it doesn't it wouldn't really it wouldn't really surprise me that much it
[511.78 → 518.70] works uh i mean yeah and do you really need uh do you really need that kind of fidelity in a pick i
[518.70 → 526.26] mean I'm just asking questions I'm just asking questions you know if you have lower fidelity
[526.26 → 531.14] you might gain a pixel here or there yeah i mean isn't that the whole point of Snapchat low fidelity
[531.14 → 538.68] get it different kinds of fidelity see that's good i got it I'm actually I'm that was
[538.68 → 542.80] pretty good I'm surprisingly funny this early in the morning that was perfect
[542.80 → 550.50] i I'm actually I'm actually giving myself one of these oh yeah that was not bad um what's her what's
[550.50 → 558.94] uh what's her nuts uh Ashley Madison just released their um just released their um most uh
[558.94 → 566.82] non-monogamous cities in Canada list oh no yeah uh Vancouver's very low really Vancouver is very low
[566.82 → 572.94] non-monogamy so uh i mean to be clear I'm not saying that that's that's a goal I'm I'm just there's
[572.94 → 577.90] there are all kinds of well there's like you know ethical non-monogamy yeah but isn't that site
[577.90 → 581.96] specifically I'm not judging I'm not judging you if you're in a molecule i think that site is like for
[581.96 → 588.58] cheating though well there's a big difference i mean is any site for anything really Luke i mean is
[588.58 → 594.30] a float plane for early access to any more well although very occasionally very
[594.30 → 597.24] occasionally there are things well i was actually hinting at something
[597.24 → 605.02] what i yeah look what i found oh wow i didn't find it Emma put it in my luggage and then i found
[605.02 → 610.74] it that way but i found a relic wow that is uh not even that many people in the audience are even
[610.74 → 616.08] going to know what that is now that's a name I've not heard in a long time a long time
[616.08 → 624.26] i pulled that on my luggage was like what is this yeah so apparently i lost the shirt but i
[624.26 → 629.78] still have the toque nice yeah i uh I'm pretty sure i still have the shirt kicking around somewhere
[629.78 → 634.06] yeah, but it's not it's not my go-to pajama shirt any more it was for a long time
[634.06 → 640.76] uh now it's my Jeep shirt oh yeah yeah another name that hasn't stood the test of time
[640.76 → 645.42] um what on earth were we supposed to be talking about oh right um google
[645.42 → 655.96] they also are recommending that google be required to license its search index data to competitors
[655.96 → 663.34] for 10 years, so this is the kind of like whoa not slap on the wrist but actual like no you guys
[663.34 → 671.24] need to not behave like this again and you guys need to take active steps to prop up your competitors
[671.24 → 677.98] to make up for the anti-competitive practices that you guys have engaged in and i have to tell you
[677.98 → 683.40] already it's like we're not even all the way through the list here already I'm looking at this going
[683.40 → 688.80] i um i have no idea what's going to happen in January
[688.80 → 696.68] because on the one hand um i think we've i think we've both been pretty happy to see
[696.68 → 704.94] the U.S. actually finally engage in oh dude Lena khan any antitrust yeah um investigations and
[704.94 → 713.30] remediation um but i have no idea whether that will or won't continue with the next administration
[713.30 → 723.20] because i think that everyone on both sides of the political spectrum can agree that um it is likely
[723.20 → 730.42] to be unpredictable yeah i know a pretty strong theory around this whole like you're going to have to
[730.42 → 738.02] sell chrome thing is that google's probable defence is going to be to delay as much as possible and try
[738.02 → 742.24] again with the new administration the thing with the new administration though is i don't think they
[742.24 → 749.94] have any particular love for Google the in general reply to that theory is that uh big tech
[749.94 → 757.28] right now is kind of at odds with both sides um which is kind of a funny thing because um a lot of
[757.28 → 764.72] the lot of the transgressions that both sides are kind of mad at big tech about are very different
[764.72 → 770.44] from each other like their sort of mad for completely different reasons yeah, and it's hard to feel bad
[770.44 → 775.08] for you know the tech billionaires that have kind of you know sold us up the river over and over and
[775.08 → 781.24] over again over the last couple of decades but i do kind of feel like at this point um now that
[781.24 → 787.06] everything's so far gone that um they just are monopolies whether they know kind of like it or not
[787.06 → 794.60] and to be clear you do not have to be the mono in monopoly it's not actually like strictly speaking
[794.60 → 801.58] necessary right um you can just be in a dominant abusively dominant position you don't actually
[801.58 → 806.44] just have to be a monopoly to fall afoul of antitrust regulations if you completely control
[806.44 → 813.34] everything yes, or you don't even or even close to it or or or collude with uh a handful of other
[813.34 → 818.74] parties to control things yeah Verulamium has an amazing video on that, so there are some very
[818.74 → 827.46] um there are some very non-monopolies um cities in Canada sorry wait what are we talking about
[827.46 → 837.28] uh the point is just that everyone's kind of mad at them and looking for an excuse to kind of
[837.28 → 844.30] punish them but the remediation that another administration might ask for might be really
[844.30 → 850.38] different yes i guess is what i would worry about so maybe roll the dice again kind of thinking
[850.38 → 855.84] this is probably one of the worst they could have got and then hoping for better i don't know yeah i
[855.84 → 860.14] do think the just jumping back to it a little bit because i saw some comments about this in the
[860.14 → 866.42] flow plane chat when we were talking about it, but the 26 billion in search deals hurting you know
[866.42 → 872.52] it's going to hurt apple but well not really uh apple will be fine yeah exactly it's really like the
[872.52 → 881.20] big damage that we're probably going to feel is to Mozilla um they're they're declining in user ship
[881.20 → 889.04] effectively constantly um oh, thanks Dan i wasn't actually i think okay i want to clarify something
[889.04 → 894.44] really quick that's not my gesture for fill my water i was checking if there was water in it
[894.44 → 898.94] that the optics of that were not great
[898.94 → 911.26] that's i didn't even notice that's pretty funny um but yeah so like honestly this shake-up okay
[911.26 → 918.10] significantly less cash in the bank i suspect it might immediately hurt Mozilla in the ability to
[918.10 → 922.24] employ people department things like that as far as my understanding goes they actually had layoffs
[922.24 → 930.52] recently i suspect that may continue if this happens but a significant shake-up in the browser
[930.52 → 940.34] market could result in a user base increase an actual one um we can hope that could result in
[940.34 → 948.26] Firefox actually having long legs instead of this just constant decline to eventual um irrelevance
[948.26 → 954.86] which they've been kind of on the path of i i i enjoy Firefox i use Firefox daily in my personal life
[954.86 → 960.38] um Firefox has been my mobile browser actually the entire time I've ever had an android phone
[960.38 → 965.80] since the very beginning of having an android phone um it's going to be so much less lucrative for
[965.80 → 972.48] Firefox to even have users if they aren't benefiting from that Google default search deal yeah um
[972.48 → 978.12] you know bing could swoop in it's not a ban of there being default search deals it's just a
[978.12 → 983.68] ban of there being you know google once um it reduces the competition yeah who's the
[983.68 → 988.40] competition why would Microsoft have to pay a ton of money for it and if I'm Microsoft
[988.40 → 996.54] and I'm watching this go down for Google I'm like i don't know if i want to do that yeah yeah i mean
[996.54 → 1002.08] that's like that's how this is supposed to work right like that's these remedies are not supposed to
[1002.08 → 1008.36] be oh here's a one billion dollar fines like cost of doing business they're supposed to be
[1008.36 → 1016.26] like oh crap everyone else looking at this going holy crap we really should not do that we should
[1016.26 → 1020.30] not do that people are talking about like duck go the issue is that duck go doesn't have any
[1020.30 → 1026.04] money like they have money, but they don't have like billions of dollars a year to use our search
[1026.04 → 1034.18] engine money otherwise they would just be doing it already uh autarky i autarky I'm guessing in
[1034.18 → 1042.12] full plane chat said uh since 2019 Mozilla has lost 30 million monthly average users yikes yeah so
[1042.12 → 1048.20] they've been on a just they've lost like almost an entire Canada of users eventually they're not gonna
[1048.20 → 1055.96] have anything to take this money from anyway right like there will be nothing for Google to have bought
[1055.96 → 1064.12] from them um so like i don't know i I'm I'm hoping that a re-roll of the dice a shake up something
[1064.12 → 1070.72] like that uh might give them a chance um it's going to hurt a lot in the short term because that money's
[1070.72 → 1074.66] just going to disappear yeah but i don't know hopefully something can happen out of this that
[1074.66 → 1079.42] that works out i think the real question Luke is what have you been doing to help Mozilla
[1079.42 → 1086.70] it's not like there aren't things you could do uh using it personally it's not enough we put i
[1086.70 → 1090.54] mean why don't you make it why don't we put on the lab site that it works best in Firefox
[1090.54 → 1094.76] why don't you make it so that float plane can only be accessed with Firefox since they're all using
[1094.76 → 1098.62] Firefox anyway it wouldn't be a problem that is a good call we probably should have done that
[1098.62 → 1103.52] yeah um i can look towards doing that in the future do you have your phone in your pocket
[1103.52 → 1112.02] is it me i think it's this iPhone i think the iPhone is uh is a lot worse in terms of
[1112.02 → 1117.34] interference because I've kept my phone over there for since before you brought the iPhone it wasn't
[1117.34 → 1122.38] causing an issue unless it got damaged and now for those missing contacts we've done some polls and
[1122.38 → 1129.14] the float plane uh the float plane audience swears up and down that they are using Firefox, but we have
[1129.14 → 1134.80] actual like site access statistics, and they don't yeah people have pointed out that you can like spoof
[1134.80 → 1140.48] it so that it reports that you're using chrome for like weird compatibility recent things i sincerely
[1140.48 → 1147.58] doubt that that percentage of people are spoofing it sincerely definitely not a thing um all right uh
[1147.58 → 1154.90] yeah more remediations not selling android but restricting it from favouring Google search now
[1154.90 → 1163.26] because this is focused on search and not you know web mail or web documents or whatever the case may
[1163.26 → 1171.08] be it sounds like they could still have default google apps but i do wonder if this uh is this all goes
[1171.08 → 1176.28] through if this all went through if Google would look at a lot of their current practices and go hey
[1176.28 → 1184.58] how do we avoid any more of this um restricting android from favouring Google search that is
[1184.58 → 1189.84] like what would that look like so instead of that default google search bar like i would be
[1189.84 → 1197.36] prompted when i suspect on phone setup you or maybe with an update now one time and then phone
[1197.36 → 1202.46] setup in the future um you would be prompted to choose your default search and there would probably
[1202.46 → 1207.66] be like you know your, and it would have to be randomized five and then other um, and it would probably
[1207.66 → 1213.88] yeah the list would probably have to be randomized wow um, and it would involve undoing google's two
[1213.88 → 1219.52] billion dollar investment in AI startup anthropic that would be a huge bummer for anthropic
[1219.52 → 1225.14] wait really why no, no no like what I'm saying not that it would be an i understand why it'd be a big
[1225.14 → 1233.36] bummer for them uh I'm wondering why they have to do this uh i don't know a ton about anthropic and
[1233.36 → 1239.54] that and that uh investment uh but what i would guess is that anthropic is uh super, super focused on
[1239.54 → 1246.90] search um but I'm just guessing I'm completely guessing uh google has responded calling the DOJ's
[1246.90 → 1255.18] proposal staggering wildly overbroad and part of a radical interventionist agenda that would harm
[1255.18 → 1265.02] Americans and break a range of Google products um in an example of how excruciatingly horrible this
[1265.02 → 1270.86] would be googled said that the proposal and this is a quote would literally require us to install not
[1270.86 → 1275.98] one but two separate choice screens before you could access google search on a pixel phone you bought
[1275.98 → 1280.96] and the design of these choice screens would have to be approved by the technical committee
[1280.96 → 1288.14] and that's just a small part of it we wish we were making this up is that an actual quote that's from
[1288.14 → 1303.68] google's blog are they for real right now um this is oh my goodness guys yeah a device setup wizard is a
[1303.68 → 1308.54] thing which you already have by the way this is actually very interesting because this is such an
[1308.54 → 1315.16] early wand show we have a bunch of EU viewers and apparently this is like already a thing for them
[1315.16 → 1322.20] that makes sense uh Draco said in the EU you already get to choose the search engine on android
[1322.20 → 1327.86] uh technically they said as far as i know at the end of that um this is hilarious yeah people are
[1327.86 → 1333.90] saying yes we have that already yeah so like what do you even mean you already did it for them
[1333.90 → 1340.86] and it's worth noting that in the EU um android actually maintains better market share than it does
[1340.86 → 1349.52] in the U.S. so clearly that ain't the variable that is affecting that so annoying what an annoying
[1349.52 → 1356.94] thing to say i hope they lose just because of that can you imagine sitting at Google and thinking
[1356.94 → 1362.82] that typing that is a good idea like how did that at a certain point you wonder if like the person who wrote it
[1362.82 → 1371.58] is like yeah let's let's torpedo ourselves a little bit because like that's the worst i don't know we wish
[1371.58 → 1379.38] we were making this up are you kidding me hold on you know what no my source thing oh my god
[1379.38 → 1387.94] like is that poking fun at yourself this is literally at blog. Google i didn't even
[1387.94 → 1394.60] believe it like i i trust Riley okay and he had the citation in there so i saw the
[1394.60 → 1399.86] citation i went i don't need to click through to this but i was like no, no the people deserve for me
[1399.86 → 1406.48] to actually click through to the Google blog yeah and see that this is literally we wish we were making
[1406.48 → 1412.42] this up i wish i was making this up we already did this in the EU so really we don't have to do any
[1412.42 → 1418.72] of this at all, but we wish we were making this up i I've had multiple conversations with multiple people
[1418.72 → 1424.74] good people strong people the best people tear streaming down their eyes the wend list of people
[1424.74 → 1432.58] um about the like the slow death of just Google in general like they suck like if we're is we're looking
[1432.58 → 1440.76] at the landscape of like modern you know web Silicon Valley style companies what have they done
[1440.76 → 1447.50] in the last long time other than just like kill stuff and not innovate let me think what have
[1447.50 → 1453.24] they're done okay does it count as a thing they've done if they ultimately killed it doesn't okay that doesn't
[1453.24 → 1461.54] count no okay hold on thinking uh google fibre well wait no hold on um and that's old at this point
[1461.54 → 1469.50] wait no uh okay hold on there's got to be something apparently uh the EU has had the choice screen
[1469.50 → 1476.06] on android since 2019 uh actually okay YouTube YouTube has done some pretty cool stuff YouTube is
[1476.06 → 1481.02] the only thing I've been able to think of that has had positive innovation, and it has also had
[1481.02 → 1489.94] really junky negative innovation yes this is true this is true um i would say oh yeah i was going to say
[1489.94 → 1494.98] that finding stuff to buy through Google search if we're talking about monopolies is better like
[1494.98 → 1500.26] the interface is better but all the sponsored stuff that gunks up the results is not better so i
[1500.26 → 1510.26] take that one back um android is better than ever yeah but like nothing crazy has changed in like
[1510.26 → 1517.46] it's better than ever though it's like sure well I'm looking google you asked me to find stuff so
[1517.46 → 1524.52] when i find stuff you don't get to be like fair yeah fair enough okay Google Workspace has
[1524.52 → 1530.42] stood still for a super long time they don't even have their own realistic chat i know they have chats
[1530.42 → 1537.94] which they swear to me that they use internally and i don't believe it uh oh, oh uh Google Maps google
[1537.94 → 1542.20] maybe they do, but they also use other things i bet maybe other people have had access to this for a
[1542.20 → 1549.10] long time but my android auto interface for Google Maps finally allows me to report problems um like
[1549.10 → 1554.62] if i see police i can report it in Google Maps i mean they acquired ways what 10 years ago um so it's
[1554.62 → 1560.80] it's its understandable it took them a little while to port that functionality over um
[1560.80 → 1568.70] someone says they've had that in maps for a long time i don't know man it is did not show up into my
[1568.70 → 1573.62] interface until like a couple of weeks ago which was the reason that i exclusively use ways even though
[1573.62 → 1579.50] ways is search is terrible like my own badminton centre doesn't show up in ways search
[1579.50 → 1587.22] and i don't I don't I don't know why because it's on Google Maps so like you, they're literally owned by
[1587.22 → 1593.70] the same company i thought that's the point of being a monopoly like the actual point but anyway
[1593.70 → 1600.16] on basically everything they've stood still on they have some people the company that are
[1600.16 → 1605.08] obviously still doing good work like they have uh their AI researchers wrote the white paper
[1605.08 → 1611.88] on like what is breaking the world right now um, but then they have liked one of the worst ones in Gemini
[1611.88 → 1616.90] because they didn't capitalize on it because they don't seem to be able to do anything and the reason
[1616.90 → 1623.12] why i got onto this topic is because of the wish we were making this up almost feels like they're
[1623.12 → 1628.34] they're pointing at themselves because the and the design of those choice screens would have to be
[1628.34 → 1636.26] approved by the technical committee that part is like okay yeah because we can't trust you to do it
[1636.26 → 1642.98] on your own based on your own website and documentation you already did it so like what are you talking about
[1642.98 → 1647.86] yeah that looks fine yeah it does it look completely fine, and they literally already did it
[1647.86 → 1654.06] yeah that looks so like let's just do that what are you talking about make things again like google
[1654.06 → 1659.94] was such a sick company i really liked google i really like Google Workspace i can't tell what's
[1659.94 → 1664.38] different in google works i can tell you cool stuff i can tell you cool stuff they've done okay they have
[1664.38 → 1670.72] those like hardware decoding cards for video hardware video decoding cards those are cool why did they
[1670.72 → 1676.08] make those i don't know like a while ago, but they like are like working on them and stuff yeah so they
[1676.08 → 1684.76] they um that's not really for users though we get the result of it yeah we look i i i have said
[1684.76 → 1693.02] before and i maintain that YouTube is one of the wonders of the world it is like i think if we when we
[1693.02 → 1698.36] if we didn't have YouTube any more we would look back on the time that we would have that we had YouTube
[1698.36 → 1704.04] and we would go the internet would be different good lord like the the the knowledge the library
[1704.04 → 1710.86] the sharing of human experience i i i really do feel like it would be a loss yeah maybe not quite
[1710.86 → 1717.44] on that level because of how little sort of written knowledge there was in the world at that time
[1717.44 → 1726.16] right um but i i i think that given even more time and given even more build-up of collective
[1726.16 → 1730.66] knowledge and experience but i think you could make the argument i just didn't want to make such a
[1730.66 → 1735.14] strong statement uh but no i think it would be i think it would be like that losing
[1735.14 → 1740.72] something of that magnitude at this time one of the big things with YouTube is when you'll, you'll find
[1740.72 → 1748.56] videos on there that are like from 13 years ago, and it's its like potato you know, but it's its when
[1748.56 → 1754.34] people were archiving footage from like pre-internet era so it's not only is it from 13 years ago it's
[1754.34 → 1759.38] actually from way before that yep and there's literally nowhere else to access it because
[1759.38 → 1767.18] on YouTube any yahoo it's kind of a joke because it's pretty good yeah uh can upload anything they
[1767.18 → 1775.84] want, and it just is there and is just documented um that is i i I'm not going to call it a
[1775.84 → 1780.90] public service because they're clearly a for-profit company and they and they profit from it um with
[1780.90 → 1786.34] your data and your attention to ads and uh your premium subscriptions and all of those things
[1786.34 → 1793.96] but it to lose it would be catastrophic i think at this point yeah but yeah they i i i when's the
[1793.96 → 1801.88] last time they launched a Gmail you know like when they launched Gmail they launched it on April fools
[1801.88 → 1807.24] almost as like a joke and then just took over the world like they don't do stuff like that
[1807.24 → 1813.98] any more Google Workspace again hasn't moved at all Gemini I'd say yeah someone's phone is oh
[1813.98 → 1821.84] sorry that's me Gemini I'd say I'd say dox is notably behind dox is noticeably better than it
[1821.84 → 1827.22] used to be at all though i as someone who uses it every day it's a lot better than it was five
[1827.22 → 1833.84] years ago I'll tell you that it's definitely better what's changed um in the last five years specifically
[1833.84 → 1838.90] i don't know but just it's the interface is just always like getting a little better it's always
[1838.90 → 1842.64] getting a little better there's still things that are probably one of those things where i can't
[1842.64 → 1846.76] imagine it but if i saw a version from five years ago it's probably changed subtly over time still
[1846.76 → 1854.00] things that are super obnoxious like once a document is pressing return is two spaces it's like damn
[1854.00 → 1857.92] near impossible to get it to stop doing that for some reason like you can go in you can tell it
[1857.92 → 1863.70] single spacing you can tell it whatever you want uh but if you like paste something in that has that
[1863.70 → 1868.44] inherent formatting in it already for some reason it just like breaks it forever as far as i can tell I'm I'm
[1868.44 → 1875.84] sure there is a way around it, but it is not intuitive to a word user um a long time word user
[1875.84 → 1880.42] someone in full point shot Tim said come on you know more than anyone that small back end changes
[1880.42 → 1885.24] are so huge, and you don't realize them unless you look at them side by side yeah i know that what i
[1885.24 → 1891.74] what i, but this is from a consumer standpoint yeah give me something as a consumer back end changes
[1891.74 → 1897.84] smooth out your infrastructure and make managing it easier, and they might even improve
[1897.84 → 1903.48] responsiveness here and there but for the most part every time that I've seen google tell me that
[1903.48 → 1909.34] a back end change is supposed to make my user experience better it has made it literally worse
[1909.34 → 1914.22] I'm sure it happens a bunch of times without them really communicating to you this is totally a thing
[1914.22 → 1918.10] it's its super annoying beyond being on a team when you have to work on stuff that users the most
[1918.24 → 1924.76] egregious example of this is the analytics dashboard which used to be extremely snappy except for the
[1924.76 → 1931.28] occasional time that it wasn't and now okay of course it's behaving well right now yeah now it is
[1931.28 → 1939.50] for the most part a piece of garbage it's actually doing really well right now um but it is had it i
[1939.50 → 1944.92] i i i could talk for a long time about how much i hate the new analytics dashboard, and it's not even
[1944.92 → 1951.18] new it's like seven years old at this point but i can't stand it i can't think of anything new that i use
[1951.18 → 1959.64] from Google and most of the old things that i use from Google are becoming harder and harder to
[1959.64 → 1966.28] justify over time due to price increases from you know getting my YouTube music from my premium
[1966.28 → 1970.60] subscription that just went up by 60 because they're trying to shoehorn in AI features that
[1970.60 → 1976.84] are really expensive dude so they're cranking the price up just give me google play music back yeah i it
[1976.84 → 1983.26] was actually better like the thing that i the one feature i cared about the reason that i spent a
[1983.26 → 1989.18] bunch of money on Sonos speakers and the reason that i got a Google play music subscription was because
[1989.18 → 1998.44] from my music app i could just click cast like just the cast button you know like the chrome
[1998.44 → 2003.32] cast button i could just click the cast button and then pick my speakers and the integration was
[2003.32 → 2009.60] perfect and flawless and i never had to touch that piece of Sonos app i like and now that it's like
[2009.60 → 2018.40] so bad that like their CEO had to apologize um i feel so validated in that sort of that decision i made
[2018.40 → 2025.88] to completely avoid it also oh my god i don't know when this happened but again back to android auto for a
[2025.88 → 2034.26] second here i can't search in my YouTube music app like i have to like i can voice search
[2034.26 → 2042.92] not in the app like i can be like i don't know play Justin Bieber or whatever right like i can do that
[2042.92 → 2050.72] but if I'm is I'm like if I'm like using the interface there's no search and the browse is super
[2050.72 → 2055.92] hamstrung and what's what's really wild is there's no start radio button in it anymore
[2055.92 → 2062.48] and that is literally like how i use my music app is like i find a song that I'm kind of in the mood
[2062.48 → 2066.92] for and then i click start radio yeah because i just want to i kind of want to listen to stuff like
[2066.92 → 2073.78] that for a bit of song yeah um and that that start radio button is no longer there in the player for
[2073.78 → 2078.34] me and i see a lot of people when i was talking about maps saying like oh yeah mine has this mine has
[2078.34 → 2083.86] that if it's all over the place though the fact that you I'm not saying you don't have it and you
[2083.86 → 2089.62] you guys might even have a start radio button i have no idea but i don't, and it is very annoying
[2089.62 → 2098.28] very annoying um okay no one is actually yeah no one's actually disagreeing with this one so i guess
[2098.28 → 2104.96] yeah it's uh it's apparently still, still bad but yeah just get bury the hatchet with Sonos
[2104.96 → 2113.52] and just make it work again please, please yeah i don't know i just um I've heard a lot of stuff
[2113.52 → 2117.66] about how and who knows what's true and what isn't true but I've heard a lot of stuff about how
[2117.66 → 2124.48] things work inside google apparently the best way to get promoted was for a long time was to like
[2124.48 → 2129.44] champion a project to launch yeah, but then you would just get promoted after it launched
[2129.44 → 2136.90] so it that project would like to lose its leader stagnate and then get closed down so it was just
[2136.90 → 2142.50] this like farm for junk for a long time so for at the beginning they were making new good things
[2142.50 → 2148.44] rapidly, and then they saw new good things coming out rapidly is a good thing for the business so let's
[2148.44 → 2153.00] incentivize that and promote people that do that um, but then the people inside that just wanted
[2153.00 → 2159.20] promotions and money uh were abandoning all their projects so they were making new good things and
[2159.20 → 2165.30] getting rid of them rapidly for many years and then now they just don't seem to really do anything
[2165.30 → 2173.12] cubes the gamer has one RCS yeah and that wasn't just a matter of like developing it that was
[2173.12 → 2180.50] like launching and maintaining for an extended period of time an extremely ultimately effective
[2180.50 → 2186.70] campaign to get attention from regulators as i was saying a big part of that was the lobbying almost
[2186.70 → 2193.42] more than anything else um i think RCS is a good example it's crazy to me that there is this few
[2193.42 → 2200.70] examples for a company of 200 000 people this is true this is fair uh google meet is pretty good these days
[2200.70 → 2210.42] I'm just saying look I'm barely matters when people are actively moving away from Google works
[2210.42 → 2215.20] because if you want to be on workspace, and you want an actually good chat client you're using
[2215.20 → 2222.46] workspace and slack and workspace and slack as a combination is quite expensive in my opinion
[2222.46 → 2230.54] slack is significantly better than teams um workspace itself though has stagnated so hard that
[2230.54 → 2237.46] Office 365 seems to have mostly caught up to them yeah it's not at parity yeah biggest problem with
[2237.46 → 2244.18] Office 365 is that teams is just such a dumpster fire um it's better than it used to be, but it's
[2244.18 → 2250.34] still so bad i have you can't schedule messages to yes you can to group chats that have not existed
[2250.34 → 2258.18] before yeah i know why well if you attach something to a chat message you have to wait for it to upload
[2258.18 → 2264.22] before you click send yeah why in slack if i attach something and click send it just sends once it
[2264.22 → 2271.10] attaches yeah duh like there 's's so many things that are just holy crap if you're in a big
[2271.10 → 2276.14] group chat it highlights the box for whoever's talking except for you so you can't tell if your
[2276.14 → 2285.18] mic's working why just why there's so much stuff that's just so confusing we need to get a couch on the
[2285.18 → 2291.66] land show set so he can but so he can lie on the couch and teams but teams therapy teams is going to
[2291.66 → 2298.06] keep improving because something that Microsoft is quite good at is this just never ending March
[2298.70 → 2305.18] yep they just keep moving usually a little bit slower yeah and sometimes backwards, but they just keep
[2305.18 → 2310.38] moving, so eventually teams will be good enough you know there's only so much you can do with the
[2310.38 → 2314.14] chat client you're seeing the type of innovation that slack has been bringing lately, and it's like
[2314.86 → 2319.50] i think we're at feature parity with MSN messenger now so the uh the only way to go is upward from
[2319.50 → 2325.18] here we're getting there, but it's its just it's going to be really hard for it teams to justify
[2325.18 → 2331.18] the cost of having an expensive Google Workspace subscription especially when they're trying to
[2331.18 → 2336.94] not give you discounts anymore unless you also buy Gemini which nobody wants and then also a very
[2336.94 → 2343.42] premium very expensive slack subscription when you could get all of that under a 365 license or a
[2343.42 → 2350.14] lark license or something like that at a massively decreased price with more features vodka makes a
[2350.14 → 2357.10] very important point here um until we have a nudge feature parity with MSN messenger uh will not have been
[2357.10 → 2363.10] achieved you are right yeah thank you for that and I'm sorry i have misspoken i have besmirched
[2363.10 → 2368.70] the good name of MSN messenger uh and i will not do it again i miss i will not do it again
[2369.42 → 2374.94] um okay what else we got here uh google claims the DOJ should be focusing on revising search
[2374.94 → 2382.06] distribution agreements instead um okay this is interesting google isn't the only one who thinks
[2382.06 → 2387.50] this is a bad idea some analysts worry about its feasibility and unintended consequences for example it
[2387.50 → 2392.30] could potentially harm schools that use chrome books and disrupt the browser market which relies heavily on
[2392.30 → 2398.78] google's open source chromium project those are both good things some analysts realize that
[2398.78 → 2405.74] something might happen if this happens um and like this is one of those things where it feels a little
[2405.74 → 2412.06] bit like the housing bubble in Vancouver where the not in my backyard the bigger the bubble gets
[2412.86 → 2419.02] the more hand-wringing there is over doing anything about this because of the economic harm, and it's like
[2419.02 → 2423.66] like right the longer you hand-wring the harder the economic harm gets but like if we'd done
[2423.66 → 2430.30] everything properly we wouldn't be here in the first place and the further we allow it to
[2430.30 → 2436.38] expand the bigger the explosion when it pops yeah like yes there's going to be collateral damage if
[2436.38 → 2441.90] all of this goes through there will absolutely be unintended consequences for sure but the longer we
[2441.90 → 2449.98] wait the worse it gets, the more atrophied every other potential competitor will become
[2449.98 → 2453.90] because of Google's dominant position why you shouldn't allow this to happen in the first place
[2453.90 → 2461.26] ideally yeah, yeah speaking of the Vancouver housing bubble it's its kind of starting to look a little
[2461.26 → 2468.38] shaky it's its looking a little uh a little sad yeah you know it's its making a noise like sales are
[2468.38 → 2474.46] erupting though yeah sales are going up which will maybe prop things up a little bit but
[2474.46 → 2481.90] also interest rates um apparently the Trudeau government is doing like uh like a buy
[2481.90 → 2488.94] your vote program right now oh yeah you saw that too I'm happy you had the exact same reaction i did
[2490.94 → 2495.10] and i saw the election's coming soon what if we uh what if we lower taxes and gave you money how about
[2495.10 → 2500.94] that huh what if we got rid of first past the post you ever think of that Mr JT yeah that thing you
[2500.94 → 2506.14] said you'd do yeah remember did you ever think of that because I'll tell you what I'll make you a deal
[2506.14 → 2515.50] Mr Trudeau right now if you're watching this i will wholeheartedly emphatically endorse you for the next
[2515.50 → 2522.46] election if you get first past the post gotten rid of if you do that thing you said you're gonna before
[2522.46 → 2530.14] the election you follow through on that first term election promise i will i will say hey
[2531.02 → 2537.82] for all of his other warts at least the ones that i can see and the ones i can't see uh don't show
[2537.82 → 2543.66] me your warts hey he's got that cool fall down the stairs trick, and he got rid of first past the post
[2543.66 → 2550.54] that's enough for me all right because we need election reform yes we do we need it desperately
[2551.02 → 2558.38] um so I'm there you go I'm in that's all you got to do what is first past the post i would actually
[2558.38 → 2564.38] recommend that you watch a cap gray video on that uh but effectively with first past the post um
[2566.14 → 2571.82] you are going to end up being forced into what is effectively a two-party system yes um if you don't
[2571.82 → 2577.34] have first past the post you then have ranked choice ideally so you rank your choices and if
[2577.34 → 2582.62] one of your parties that you voted for as your first choice is clearly definitely going to lose
[2582.62 → 2587.90] they just dump that, and your vote goes towards the second choice and so on and so forth until there's
[2587.90 → 2595.50] a winner um it also makes it so that like lets's say you had a super polarized electorate
[2595.50 → 2604.46] hypothetical scenario um if is is you had uh if is you had your rank chose rank choice voting card
[2604.46 → 2612.46] and it had um like the the the super right-wing party here, or you had a super right-wing party kind
[2612.46 → 2620.06] of a centrist party and a super left-wing party if you were to say uh well okay i am very aligned with
[2620.06 → 2625.58] the right-wing party and very misaligned with the left-wing party but i guess these centre guys would
[2625.58 → 2632.94] kind of be okay and if everybody basically did that but like flip-flopped that centre party would
[2632.94 → 2638.62] actually have some representation in the formed government yeah because if everyone kind of
[2638.62 → 2645.02] agreed that these guys are okay even though one of the other two hyper polarized parties was their first
[2645.02 → 2653.42] choice um those centrist sort of mindsets would be much more represented is pretty much what
[2653.42 → 2659.26] it would come down to first past the post drives people to extremes because it ends up making in my
[2659.26 → 2666.54] opinion most people vote on an anything but them type basis instead of for what they actually want
[2667.18 → 2673.98] um and ranked choice voting allows you to vote for what you actually want which is like an enormously
[2673.98 → 2680.30] massive difference yeah or or or more like it allows you to it allows you to specify what would
[2680.30 → 2687.90] be completely unacceptable and what would be more acceptable and what would be preferred and then you
[2687.90 → 2695.18] can you can account for that it often results in something that's a little bit more average not necessarily
[2696.14 → 2702.06] the best or better, but it'll, it'll help lean towards something that's a little bit more average instead of more
[2702.06 → 2707.02] extreme i don't think there's any like voting system that involves everyone
[2708.78 → 2713.50] and is perfect i don't think there's any voting system that's perfect really no but first past the
[2713.50 → 2720.70] post is like definitely one of the worst yes there are worse ones yeahs but it's one of the worst but
[2720.70 → 2729.98] first past the post is perfect for the incumbent um it's perfect for those parties that are that
[2729.98 → 2734.62] currently hold all the power so that's why it's really hard to get any kind of reform passed because
[2734.62 → 2740.62] they are highly disincentivized to do if it's really it's really frustrating uh why is it called first
[2740.62 → 2745.66] past the post ask shortcut it's called first past the post because whoever uh passes the requisite number
[2745.66 → 2754.54] of votes to win that race just takes all the marbles um instead of accounting for anything else
[2754.54 → 2760.86] uh digital b11 says Verulamium has a good video on voting systems and uh that makes perfect sense I'm
[2760.86 → 2763.34] sure Derek does so why don't you guys go check that out yeah
[2766.06 → 2768.70] uh moving on did we finish the Google topic um
[2770.86 → 2775.66] discussion question google blog post multi-convert google has told
[2776.22 → 2780.30] android authority that google's multi-year plan to migrate from OS fully over to android which lines
[2780.30 → 2784.30] up with the Google blog post from June 2024 swapping parts of chroma yeah i know i think we're
[2784.54 → 2787.42] pretty much done i think we've talked about this enough okay so what do you want us to do Dan
[2787.90 → 2793.98] announcements oh you want us to do announcements oh good lord there's a handful of announcements today
[2794.78 → 2802.78] uh, uh okay from tuesday, November 26th to monday, December 2nd we will be running some incredible
[2802.78 → 2807.58] deals on some of our most popular products at Ltd store but what we're really excited for are these
[2807.58 → 2810.78] bundles that we're putting together with the help of some of our partners if you've already seen
[2810.78 → 2819.10] our Black Friday Cyber Monday um email sing up page then there's something new on it uh make sure
[2819.10 → 2825.34] you sign up so you don't miss out on the deals also float plane subscribers oh this is this because
[2825.34 → 2831.42] of uh like the new like better integration between float plane and Ltd store or like what is this quite
[2831.42 → 2836.14] similar to what we had before it's just a different way of using it oh okay float plane subscribers will be
[2836.14 → 2844.30] getting one day of early access on monday, November 25th let's go now my understanding is that early
[2844.30 → 2854.14] access is to the week-long deals, but it is possible that there are messages on my phone that will further
[2854.14 → 2865.34] clarify what is going on but it, but that's something okay uh what no i do not have any further messages on
[2865.34 → 2871.02] my phone so i think that would be the week-long deals i don't think that that will necessarily
[2871.02 → 2878.06] include some of the very limited quantity flash deals but i do not know for sure the way to know
[2878.06 → 2887.42] for sure is to be signed up for the newsletter so that is at leg.GG slash BCM Dan do you want to throw
[2887.42 → 2893.18] that in all the chats to make sure that everybody gets that can do now it's time for us to play a game
[2893.18 → 2897.26] we're sorry we're playing some people are saying that they don't see the email sign up form it's
[2897.26 → 2900.46] probably because you have something blocking it nice
[2903.50 → 2910.06] makes sense modern internet is a thing okay Luke let's see if you can guess what these items are
[2910.78 → 2916.54] sorry i don't have an item here Dan do you know anything about this is it these what are these
[2916.54 → 2921.50] no i don't I've been wondering about what's with everything on the down there oh Dan's there
[2921.50 → 2928.70] what these items are what items um but i think you had a good feeling about the item in the
[2928.70 → 2935.10] middle of last i don't know what the items are is it in this i think you had a good feeling what they
[2935.10 → 2943.50] were the bag i guess so uh Riley had mentioned this I'm I'm so sorry Riley uh okay cool why don't we
[2943.50 → 2949.90] come back to this who's guessing game plan for products on set which will be uh i don't know
[2950.46 → 2958.94] uh here anyway so the early access thing um uh subscribe at leg.GG slash FP Black Friday
[2958.94 → 2964.38] uh to subscribe to float plane um people are saying it's the bundles at the bottom of the black
[2964.38 → 2971.90] Friday page oh the question mark things oh I'm supposed to guess what they are thanked you audience okay
[2971.90 → 2978.14] there we go the big freaking bundles okay specific am I supposed to get i think you're
[2978.14 → 2986.06] supposed to get very specific how the heck really uh Pikachu
[2990.06 → 2997.26] guess that can you just say ditto for every single one and still win um i don't know the first one
[2997.26 → 3003.50] based on what looks like the wrist rest attachment and the fact that it is doesn't have
[3003.50 → 3008.94] uh the no you're supposed to guess the middle one the middle one oh it's a stream deck okay it's
[3008.94 → 3013.34] apparently in the human organ transplant bag that is on the set oh whoops that's my thing
[3015.02 → 3024.86] why Luke i don't know what's going on right now any more than you do sure yeah cool oh it's not
[3024.86 → 3029.50] it's a wave SLR it's from the same brand oh wow you got it wrong I'm sure they use the same housing
[3029.50 → 3036.46] wow Luke you're zero for one wait i don't think I'm going to get any of these then check it wait what
[3036.46 → 3043.10] no hold on a second what's going on what i don't think that's right because the doc says
[3044.06 → 3048.94] the doc says legato stream deck mark ii is supposed to be in the organ transplant bag
[3048.94 → 3054.86] what is happening right now
[3060.06 → 3061.18] you can't do this anymore
[3067.58 → 3073.98] um okay from the shadow you literally can't tell the difference between the two okay i have one on
[3073.98 → 3081.82] my desk it looks like what is the silhouette on the right uh it's a keyboard Mon um i don't know I'm
[3081.82 → 3088.86] my guess on the right Luke that's the left oh uh headphone uh Mon um these look like Sennheiser
[3088.86 → 3097.02] they look like Jamaican headphones no I'll say Pokémon sure who's that Pokémon yeah sure yeah yeah um
[3097.02 → 3106.06] um do any Pokémon have Mon at the end of the name squirt lemon anyway uh they look like Pokémon
[3108.38 → 3114.30] i don't know i don't know it's too ugly um that's a that's a good reference um
[3115.66 → 3120.62] the cucumber song thing about how it's good for you or whatever yeah yeah i don't know why i remember
[3120.62 → 3125.50] that jam on they look like they look like i can't take credit for that i can't take credit for that
[3125.50 → 3132.78] that goes to sinful hands and float clean jack um they look like uh Sennheiser headphones I'm
[3132.78 → 3140.06] guessing based on the band that they're like uh 600s all right check under your table right now
[3140.06 → 3147.18] what was wrong last time i don't know dude i don't know they're Sennheiser they're not 600s
[3147.18 → 3155.34] they're HD 560s open back headphones uh nice both of these items are going to be included in bundles
[3155.34 → 3160.38] that are on sale throughout the entire event or until we run out which is probably more likely but
[3160.38 → 3167.26] there's a third item on the left good gravy this is taking forever corsair k65 corsair k65 did you
[3167.26 → 3173.90] look at the dock no okay uh it looks like it has a tent it doesn't open the LTT backpack that is here
[3173.90 → 3185.42] between us Luke wow nope it's the k70 core TKL with corsair
[3187.42 → 3195.74] i thought it said milks and i was like really uh mix red smooth linear switches a 120 keyboard that will
[3195.74 → 3202.14] be included in a bundle at no extra cost along with one more thing, but this bundle is going to be
[3202.14 → 3205.34] dropping on a random day throughout the week so I'd really recommend you sign up for email
[3205.34 → 3211.34] notifications at leg.GG BCM to have the best chance at securing one so i was five switches off
[3212.22 → 3216.54] yeah, yeah good right brand though you can kind of tell from the silhouette that it's a corsair
[3216.54 → 3224.30] keyboard yeah okay so we made our way through that eventually yeah um also uh what are those what are
[3224.30 → 3231.82] those for the announcement left hand for the announcement right hand uh okay so Linus camp oh but hold on I'm
[3231.82 → 3237.18] going to figure this out uh our collaborative wrist rest with delta hub is back in stock and this time
[3237.18 → 3241.74] the left-hand variants are available too they sold out quickly during the first run and this time you
[3241.74 → 3246.22] can get early access to the Black Friday sale you can get 15 off by going through our link in the video
[3246.22 → 3252.62] description and finally oh this is an announcement, but it's nothing to do with the store OVH cloud summit
[3252.62 → 3260.70] 2024 why is it that Luke has a go bag with him right now not because the world has ended yet

[3289.90 → 3293.98] genuinely that should be pretty fun I've seen the lineup of people that I'll be interviewing i I'm
[3293.98 → 3299.82] actually genuinely so are you like a media personality again or like what do you even i guess who
[3299.82 → 3306.06] who are you i don't know what exactly is it that you do not sure to be honest okay just stuff whatever
[3306.06 → 3312.78] comes up prominent guy they should just ask for that to be your little like tag that would be pretty
[3312.78 → 3317.98] funny because no like honestly though i don't know like i do this thing yeah you're like you're a
[3317.98 → 3327.10] renaissance man podcaster development team lead um lab thing yeah bird enthusiast i don't know there's
[3327.10 → 3335.42] all there are all kinds of uh like uh infrastructure enjoyer historically great lover of chicken
[3336.06 → 3341.18] specifically chicken he loves chicken yes he just really loves it chicken's very effective
[3341.18 → 3344.06] that's what he loves about it yeah it's the most effective bird
[3346.38 → 3351.74] yep uh 100 hit rate on chicken why'd the chicken cross the road to get away from Luke
[3355.10 → 3359.34] you have no idea how many chickens have sacrificed themselves for my mediocre physique
[3359.34 → 3367.10] um that's a stolen joke but anyway um yeah but i think it's actually going to be really fun I'm
[3367.10 → 3372.62] excited about that okay tune in cool what else are we even what are we supposed to be talking about
[3372.62 → 3376.94] today Dan can you please get this show back on the rails I've been trying are you still are you done
[3376.94 → 3383.02] with the announcement i don't know am I I'll read the doc for you then let's see yeah that looks about
[3383.02 → 3388.54] right then let's do some merch messages okay sure merch messages so you head on the store you uh
[3388.54 → 3392.86] add something to your card a box pops up you leave a merch message we think it's better than super
[3392.86 → 3399.42] chats or twitch bits because hey uh if we get to your message great or Dan can pop it up down here or
[3399.42 → 3404.06] reply to it or forward it to someone internally to get you an answer well you know we're going to do our
[3404.06 → 3409.26] best to acknowledge your merch message but if we don't then hey well there's always uh you know
[3409.26 → 3415.74] getting some high quality merchandise in the mail yeah all right cool so anyway uh merch messages hit
[3415.74 → 3422.62] me show us how it works Dan sure uh let's see up here first is from Zachary how much is googled to
[3422.62 → 3428.06] blame for people getting scammed Facebook and Instagram don't have customer support but if you google
[3428.06 → 3432.38] it a bunch of scam results appear should customer support be mandatory
[3432.38 → 3440.38] so i think there's more of an issue with uh like Facebook not having customer support
[3440.38 → 3444.38] incredible amount of free products that would instantly cease to exist
[3446.38 → 3453.10] oh man to be clear yeah so okay so basically what you're saying is that google is returning search
[3453.10 → 3459.90] results that are invalid and that are scams when people are trying to contact Facebook and Instagram
[3459.90 → 3469.34] support okay so step number one is yes a customer or help option of some sort should absolutely be
[3469.34 → 3475.18] mandatory for any business and especially for someone that operates on the order that Facebook does
[3475.98 → 3481.90] like if we can afford to have customer support Facebook can afford to have customer support so any free
[3481.90 → 3489.58] service has to have customer support well dude nothing's free it's not free, so there's that Facebook you're
[3489.58 → 3494.86] absolutely paying for your pay in your data and if it wasn't profitable they wouldn't be doing it if
[3494.86 → 3499.82] that became a lot genuinely a lot of services would instantly shut down if they had to have customer
[3499.82 → 3505.50] support yeah well hold on a second because I'm not saying every service like if there's some like
[3506.38 → 3512.86] back-end project or something that we have implementation for on our website or something like that
[3513.42 → 3518.54] i think if you are consumer facing maybe i should call it consumer support then if you are
[3518.54 → 3524.70] end user facing give me an example of someone who shouldn't have to have end user support for
[3524.70 → 3531.66] their product straw pull is straw pull even a company uh i don't know
[3534.06 → 3539.90] and like realistically i pulled that off out of the top of my head okay hold on a second you uh do they
[3539.90 → 3544.54] have support watch them have support well hold on a second what the devil is contact them
[3544.54 → 3554.78] they have pricing type form and why do they have straw pull straw type straw pull easiest
[3554.78 → 3560.30] pull creator ever that only okay well apparently there's competition in the creation a quick pull
[3560.30 → 3564.94] create a quick pull space also hold on a second they have support
[3564.94 → 3573.58] they totally have support i just confirmed it on mine contact us support email so they have an okay
[3573.58 → 3579.10] they have a pricing structure now though so i did I wasn't aware try again sir i don't know give me an
[3579.10 → 3584.06] example of something that shouldn't have support everything should have support because how else are you
[3584.06 → 3591.34] going to get customer feedback literally if we didn't have Ltd store support how would we ever improve
[3591.34 → 3598.30] yeah, but that's a store that's like a that's a very different situation okay fine any if we
[3598.30 → 3604.14] didn't have float plane support how would we improve float plane is a paid to access service everything is
[3604.14 → 3609.34] paid though everything's paid you pay with your attention looking at ads you pay with your personal
[3609.34 → 3617.18] information you pay with your credit card you pay for everything's paid so i not there's no free
[3617.18 → 3626.86] lunch yeah i can't think of examples right now small Linux distros uh Linux support for Linux distros
[3627.74 → 3633.98] i think there are some like support forums would that count i think that is account stack overflow um
[3634.62 → 3640.70] you know what no i will see here's my problem because i think in the case of something like a
[3640.70 → 3645.90] Linux distro i actually would say that yeah i think that i think that counts i think that's valid
[3645.90 → 3652.06] right because if it's a community created community supported product then i think it can be yeah then
[3652.06 → 3656.78] it can be community supported community created can be community supported but the fact that Microsoft
[3656.78 → 3661.82] for example has that i forget what it's called like Microsoft answers or like what's it called give
[3661.82 → 3667.66] me a second I'll get there so the fact that Microsoft relies on community contributors to answer
[3667.66 → 3673.58] support inquiries for freaking windows yeah it's ridiculous is actually comical and actually very annoying
[3673.58 → 3680.14] to be honest like actually comical because it basically just gives them a shield to put in front
[3680.14 → 3685.74] of themselves to not have to fix things that are problems if they were is they were actually accountable
[3685.74 → 3692.70] if they had to pay if they had to pay billable hours to employees or contractors to sit and explain to
[3692.70 → 3700.14] people why freaking search doesn't work if that was actually on their books we might get a different
[3700.14 → 3705.02] response from them about it maybe they might actually fix it, or it would just be canned responses
[3705.66 → 3710.06] because eventually, eventually like someone would look at it and go
[3710.78 → 3715.42] hmm it might actually be cheaper to just develop a fix to this oh they would just script a canned
[3715.42 → 3721.10] response to everybody and not actually deal with them turn it AI but yeah what about this what about
[3721.10 → 3728.94] it that's a that's a forum where support uh you hold on no, no no we have we have you can
[3728.94 → 3733.58] contact an admin or moderator we literally have that I'm going to find it I'm going to find it smart guy
[3733.58 → 3743.42] it's not official support though so well hold on staff okay Linus tech and I'm not logged in but you
[3743.42 → 3749.82] can literally send me a message, but that's not support no it's not but hold on hold on okay
[3750.62 → 3756.78] by the way don't bother because i don't reply to them anymore but um no, no I'm pretty sure I'm pretty
[3756.78 → 3762.46] sure there's uh I'm pretty sure there's stuff hold on I'm going to find it he hasn't found it yet
[3762.46 → 3766.86] forum support we'll find it eventually there we go it's right there we totally have support now i knew
[3766.86 → 3772.62] we had support smart guy we 100 you know why we have that support though because you should have
[3772.62 → 3782.78] support no for uh GDPR forget me requests uh sort of actually, but it's because we did sales through
[3782.78 → 3787.26] the forum okay, but we would need it anyway, and we would totally have it anyway
[3789.10 → 3797.34] no i i I'm not you know what I'm going to die on this hill every service that is customer facing
[3797.34 → 3803.50] consumer facing and anyone who pays you in any way whether it's with their blood or their
[3805.26 → 3811.58] DNA freaking collection companies man 23 and me's implosion is terrifying if you're not terrified of
[3811.58 → 3816.06] that you should be terrified of that even if you never sent your genetic information to them
[3816.70 → 3822.94] if anyone even kind of related to you did you could be like that whole thing sucks and I'm
[3822.94 → 3827.42] furious about it still I'm probably screwed and just don't know you're actually screwed and do know
[3827.42 → 3834.30] yeah um what was I going to say would you accept some form of threshold of like revenue for
[3834.30 → 3839.10] the company or something like that like there's a lot of laws like flow planes protected by these
[3839.10 → 3844.22] amount of these where if is you're is you're below a certain amount of revenue certain laws don't
[3844.22 → 3850.30] take place yet i think as long as we also account for well we have like very little revenue but we
[3850.30 → 3856.70] do have a casual like nine billion dollars in seed funding like i think basically once uh once
[3856.70 → 3863.74] a certain amount of money is flowing in some way I'm down with that you should support the product so
[3863.74 → 3869.82] once you either have a certain amount of revenue or have raised a certain amount of dollars um I'd be
[3869.82 → 3875.50] completely fine with that i just think i think this has there are a lot of these types of laws that i see
[3875.50 → 3886.62] come in that to a certain degree seem designed to benefit big players and like some random little
[3886.62 → 3891.74] forum or some random little thing here or there that like you know maybe they do make money off of it
[3891.74 → 3897.10] um i would they probably actually do have some team boo suggests that another threshold could be users
[3897.66 → 3905.82] and i think that's valid that's an interesting one um there's a contact is there actually a support
[3905.82 → 3914.78] though wow this website is rough um i just went to paint.net oh yeah good old paint.net the email is
[3914.78 → 3918.62] not for technical support or troubleshooting there's a forum linked below there's an example
[3918.62 → 3925.82] yep there's just a support forum please ask our forum but isn't paint.net uh like open source
[3926.62 → 3934.94] there's a donate button yeah, but that's uh i again you said any site or service no what i said
[3934.94 → 3940.78] is that if it is community created then it can be community supported so i said the forum's valid for
[3940.78 → 3945.58] that okay, okay i don't remember that bit but i believe you yeah i was probably thinking about something
[3945.58 → 3953.74] else oh okay chicken probably i haven't eaten today so maybe um yeah i don't know i think if there
[3953.74 → 3959.90] was some amount of yeah either a user count or a revenue count or a total raised money freeware not
[3959.90 → 3965.02] open source sorry, sorry and yes this is a perfect point CNG supernova says open source doesn't
[3965.02 → 3971.58] mean community created um that's also very true actually very true often means limited amount of
[3971.58 → 3976.86] contributors because uh because i don't know either there often isn't that many contributors
[3976.86 → 3982.86] or it's people that just want credit for job applications uh hex dot says no chance uh with
[3982.86 → 3987.98] Elon as part of the next used administration doesn't tesla not even have PR any more they don't have PR
[3987.98 → 3992.62] but what they do have is customer support they actually they do have support if you are an
[3992.62 → 3997.34] individual end user you can 100 contact tesla about whatever issue you're having with your model
[3997.34 → 4004.78] whatever um so let's just let you know look I'm not a fan of a lot of stuff that he's done especially
[4004.78 → 4011.26] over the last few years there seems to be kind of this weird kind of turn that he's taken uh but
[4011.26 → 4017.58] let's let's not uh let's not make things up right um
[4020.30 → 4024.06] yeah MIG says Elon is their PR department for better or for worse
[4024.06 → 4029.98] that is a true statement uh let's maybe move on to yeah I've got to get out of here in like

[4132.06 → 4136.06] talking points a little bit here i had no idea they had a store in metro town yeah, yeah like a physical
[4136.06 → 4140.70] store i hadn't been to metro town in like eight years i haven't seen it because i haven't been
[4140.70 → 4145.74] there since they opened the store but i just know that cool our team loves their versus because here
[4145.74 → 4150.54] in Vancouver the weather is always so unpredictable i actually hate this talking point uh because the
[4150.54 → 4156.14] weather in Vancouver is not unpredictable it's extremely predictable it rains yeah which doesn't
[4156.14 → 4161.10] change the fact that versus are good for it is just is very predictable their new courtside classics

[4181.66 → 4187.98] and my hesitation there guys my hesitation there is that i have a belief this is a core belief of mine
[4187.98 → 4195.10] that nothing is waterproof if water can can carve chasms into the face of the earth then it
[4195.10 → 4201.42] can with enough time um break down just about anything so there's patient so that that's that's
[4201.42 → 4207.74] my only thing i don't call anything waterproof um finally the show is brought to you by server part deals
[4207.74 → 4215.90] oh okay i know about dropping things but I'm not the only one sometimes your package might be dropped
[4215.90 → 4222.46] even harder by the courier imagine if your wife's anniversary gift is in that box or even worse your
[4222.46 → 4229.74] hard drive our sponsor server part deals thought about that they sell recertified refurbished and new
[4229.74 → 4235.90] hard drives and have a growing collection of enterprise SSDs to avoid that kind of tragedy they offer some of
[4235.90 → 4241.34] the best packaging in the industry they've custom designed both their individual and bulk packaging
[4241.34 → 4247.90] and offer free two-day shipping, and it says show the packaging on camera for a better environment
[4247.90 → 4255.50] this container was not bleached white okay very cool and what am I about to find we
[4258.30 → 4263.90] and we've got some boobies the cushions in this box are manufactured from 100 post-consumer
[4263.90 → 4272.86] recycled plastic cool that's nice it genuinely looks very cushioned wow that is a yeah that's a firm
[4272.86 → 4279.66] cushion oh okay oh neat yeah this is different from what I've seen before so you kind of go like this
[4280.22 → 4285.98] and then your hard drive comes out and that's a casual 24 terabyte Seagate Eros in there
[4285.98 → 4293.82] very cool is that one of ours uh oh yeah look we've inventoried it that might be for mother
[4293.82 → 4299.82] vault please don't drop that one oh okay although if it was in the packaging it wouldn't matter right
[4299.82 → 4303.98] so what you're saying is that i should drop it but i should just put it back in here first right Dan
[4303.98 → 4308.46] yeah that's probably from one of the v devs that's live so if we lose that drive we'll lose the entirety of
[4308.46 → 4314.94] the mother vault what really no what we like to live dangerous no there's no way that's true stop it
[4314.94 → 4323.34] re-silvering takes eight days uh we wouldn't, we don't we wouldn't do that yeah okay Dan but i bet
[4323.34 → 4328.70] but I'm sure you could anyway so many levels why would that have been done yeah anyway um
[4330.54 → 4336.14] uh they test every single drive they sell even manufacturer recertified drives go through read
[4336.14 → 4340.22] right speed testing and sector scanning, and they have their smart data checked for bad and
[4340.22 → 4344.54] reallocated sectors they have many manufacturer recertified drives that are only a fraction of
[4344.54 → 4348.70] the price of brand-new ones while still delivering reliable performance if you need to help their customer
[4348.70 → 4356.22] service Luke is not outsourced and can be reached store and can be reached through live chat or calls
[4356.22 → 4364.22] check out server part deals at serverpartdeals.com LTT and use code LTT to get five percent off on any order
[4364.22 → 4369.34] which might not sound like a super deep discount code but guys you got to understand this is a very
[4369.34 → 4378.62] very different slimmer business model very a lot of other um you know services and products online
[4378.62 → 4385.98] that literally will have like 25 30 points baked into them so that they can offer a discount um yeah
[4386.62 → 4392.06] that's five percent off on hard drives is like good so uh go for it, I'm also told that they actually
[4392.06 → 4398.22] sent us that hard drive too oh okay they sent the hard drive okay hey thanks oh so that's just like
[4398.22 → 4403.02] legitimately exactly how it was packaged because yeah that's how it was sent it that makes sense and
[4403.02 → 4410.86] then we owned and torrid it which destroyed the entire bit but okay neat okay um i want to talk about
[4410.86 → 4420.86] this the topic is you all don't seem to want actual tech tips yeah i uh i saw this did you did you
[4420.86 → 4425.58] check out the video i checked out the video um there was also if i remember correctly there was
[4425.58 → 4432.46] actually a Reddit thread talking about how good parts of the video were even though the person
[4432.46 → 4436.46] recognized i think it was about this video i don't remember I'm I'm i didn't know this was going
[4436.46 → 4441.42] to be a topic in the doc so i didn't prep for this um how good parts of the video were even though
[4441.42 → 4446.62] they're usually just interested in the entertainment parts of the video they saw how it was like connected
[4446.62 → 4451.10] to real world things they're like wow this is really cool and i was like yeah so we did a video
[4451.10 → 4456.54] this week that has changed titles a couple of times because it's performing trying to make it work
[4456.54 → 4462.86] terribly, and basically it was me and Elijah and i got to give some credit to proof who was
[4462.86 → 4468.06] actually the one who did the Facebook marketplace dumpster diving before uh the project got passed to
[4468.06 → 4473.58] Elijah to get it across the finish line um and right now it's called i built an insane surround
[4473.58 → 4480.94] sound setup for under 250 dollars and the original title focused on um building a home an entire
[4480.94 → 4486.62] home theatre for less than the price of the most popular soundbar and i don't know if the boast TV
[4486.62 → 4492.06] speaker is the most popular soundbar today, but it was the last time we did a why is everybody buying
[4492.06 → 4497.82] this uh this soundbar it was the most popular soundbar on i believe Amazon was the platform
[4497.82 → 4506.46] that we were using for that series at that time and the amount of criticism for this video slash the
[4506.46 → 4513.02] extremely low performance of this video has been a little demoralizing for me to be perfectly honest
[4513.02 → 4518.78] with you, I've seen a lot of people that are kind of dunking on it for being you know another
[4518.78 → 4525.18] Facebook marketplace video um I've seen a fair number of people dunking on it because we're comparing
[4525.18 → 4531.26] against a new soundbar instead of comparing against a secondhand soundbar so they see it as kind of like
[4531.26 → 4539.26] an unfair fight um I've seen quite a few people say that um you know the odds of them being able to
[4539.26 → 4547.66] find the exact parts that we're using are basically zero therefore this is not applicable to anybody and
[4547.66 → 4555.26] i have to say guys i don't know i don't know i don't know how to deal i don't know how to deal
[4555.26 → 4560.38] with that and if the video was performing great like if it was getting a ton of views um then it would
[4560.38 → 4566.70] be fine but i guess what I'm trying to say is like I'm looking at this going like real tech tips might not
[4566.70 → 4573.58] be sustainable like if this time is people are what did I do what can I do differently i guess is what I'm
[4573.58 → 4578.62] asking because like to your like what you said is exactly right like that's that's not the point
[4578.62 → 4585.50] the point is not finding the exact av receiver that we did yeah the point is the journey did you watch
[4585.50 → 4589.74] the video by any chance, and it's fine if you didn't it wasn't this one i watched a different one so
[4589.74 → 4596.06] basically what we did was we got a few different options we started land centre audio one
[4596.06 → 4602.30] got it uh we started with an old home theatre in the box um so it was a number of years old and it
[4602.30 → 4606.78] was probably around 500 bucks when it was new, but it was like 40 bucks today which realistically for
[4606.78 → 4614.86] this kind of low quality semi-proprietary um surround solutions it's probably more like it
[4614.86 → 4620.22] um they tend to be a little bit overpriced at MSRP but if you can get them on clearance they can
[4620.22 → 4626.22] actually be a pretty great deal um so we started with one of those and showed that even for 40 dollars
[4626.22 → 4631.50] on like a marketplace site like Craigslist or Facebook marketplace we could absolutely obliterate this
[4631.50 → 4639.10] thing we were unflinching in our acknowledgement of the inconvenience and the wiring mess
[4639.74 → 4644.14] that was another thing man i saw people like defending soundbar super hard for the ease of
[4644.14 → 4652.14] use and I'm like guys we acknowledged that so directly that i just um
[4654.46 → 4658.94] i just i don't know uh i don't I don't know how to i don't know how we can acknowledge it more
[4658.94 → 4664.46] uh we stepped it up by upgrading our left and rights so that you know particularly for watching
[4664.46 → 4669.82] anything with music in it which is like all content we could get a bit better of a
[4669.82 → 4675.58] soundtrack experience uh we upgraded our amplifier, or maybe we upgraded the amplifier before we changed
[4675.58 → 4681.58] this be whatever we but we got a cheap av rum and with the intention not of using it for video
[4681.58 → 4686.94] switching because you can't use an older one for video switching if you want to run like you know a
[4686.94 → 4693.82] modern 4k display or whatever the case may be so we got an old amp and old amps like they're
[4693.82 → 4700.62] still great amplifiers if you buy something that was decent 10 years ago 15 years ago you can still
[4700.62 → 4705.98] get a really nice amplifier um, and then you just don't run your video through it which for most
[4705.98 → 4710.86] people is fine because your TV is probably going to have anywhere from two on the very, very low end
[4710.86 → 4717.42] to four inputs anyway so you just run everything through there and then uh we added a subwoofer and
[4717.42 → 4725.42] then we added some cheap towers that we got, and the final configuration was probably around 240 dollars
[4725.42 → 4733.26] compared to the boas TV speaker which is 250 dollars um and our point was just and there were so many
[4733.26 → 4738.78] tech tips along the way i guess is what I'm trying to get to here sort of talking about speaker impedance best
[4738.78 → 4745.82] practices uh talking about uh what you can do if you don't have e-arc support on your receiver so
[4745.82 → 4752.22] talking about uh optical connections and the and the good things about it and the limitations of it um
[4752.86 → 4763.58] and i uh i think honestly past a certain view count there just isn't really room for it um maybe I'm
[4763.58 → 4768.54] being too doomed about this i would like to think that I'm being too doomed about this but i don't necessarily
[4768.54 → 4776.22] think i am I think a pretty good example of this of is maybe Michael reeves when you look at some of
[4776.22 → 4784.94] Michael reeves videos if i remember correctly um his very early videos he talked more about the programming
[4784.94 → 4792.70] that was involved and showed more of it and these days it's usually like a comical montage where sections
[4792.70 → 4798.78] of the code like fly past the screen uh like it's its it's different people don't actually
[4800.30 → 4806.94] care i know there was like if you think about old YouTube there were a lot of videos that
[4806.94 → 4812.86] were like tutorials on how to do something and the people that were making the tutorials on how to do
[4812.86 → 4819.02] something videos realized that no one was actually doing it they were just watching them for the content so
[4819.02 → 4824.62] they tried to push entertainment, and it started leaving the actual tutorial space there's some
[4824.62 → 4829.82] perfect insight in float plane chat um like some people are saying yeah i really liked it to be
[4829.82 → 4836.54] clear i mean 900 000 plus people watched it and like the like dislike ratio is fine like it's not like
[4836.54 → 4841.26] people are hating on it, I'm just trying to figure out how to make like someone here said uh
[4841.26 → 4847.58] where's their comment um maybe it was just not that great of a video um can we just move on
[4847.58 → 4851.98] well no, no no, no no, no, but the point is like I'm trying to figure out how to make this more
[4851.98 → 4857.74] accessible because i want people to save money like that's why that's why we do this in the that's
[4857.74 → 4862.14] why we started doing this in the first place right is bringing the people tech tips, and we want to do
[4862.14 → 4872.22] it in an entertaining way but we want to we want to like help um so i so I'm trying to
[4872.22 → 4878.70] like figure this out um why does being critical of the content uh mean the video was bad okay no, no
[4878.70 → 4883.18] there's hold on there 's's some there's some perfect there's some perfect comments uh on
[4883.18 → 4888.06] it, so some people are saying in my area uh marketplace especially for this kind of stuff
[4888.06 → 4892.38] is kind of terrible i sometimes have to travel a couple of hours for a deal on gaming computers yeah
[4892.38 → 4898.14] well that that's a thing like that's a thing here too yeah and we but we acknowledge the time spent
[4898.14 → 4905.10] in it and i think that like that mindset of like sort of bargain hunting is uh is what we're trying
[4905.10 → 4908.78] to get across so maybe that's something that we need to acknowledge more directly is like
[4909.34 → 4915.66] hey this has a cost in time like do you think that's something that would help maybe um
[4917.10 → 4924.22] um i don't know was that not explained uh come bets and bulls and says i found it a bit hard to
[4924.22 → 4928.22] get what the point of the video was I felt like it was a little bit all over the place so maybe it's
[4928.22 → 4932.54] something where we need a bit of a better summary, or we need a couple other comments like that we need
[4932.54 → 4939.02] more like visuals to kind of drive it along uh Braga i think probably has the best comment I've seen
[4939.02 → 4945.42] on it so far i bet the same video would have blown up if you'd done five versus 50 versus 500 home theatre
[4945.42 → 4956.06] speaker set up and that is that is probably the best maybe we just should uh maybe we should
[4956.06 → 4962.70] maybe we should revisit it and like keep that same stuff get a five dollar option we've already got our
[4962.70 → 4969.26] fifty dollar option we upgrade our 250 option a little bit we take it to 500 bucks we get a five
[4969.26 → 4975.18] thousand dollar option, and then we like contact some we contact clips or something, and we like
[4975.18 → 4981.66] we borrow crazy yeah we borrow like a fifty thousand dollar option and then we just we do it again
[4981.66 → 4987.50] um postman says as an av professional i really enjoyed the video and the journey i guess maybe that's
[4987.50 → 4993.34] maybe that's the thing is maybe the journey is too hard to follow along maybe like simplifying the
[4993.34 → 5002.54] format to like five versus 50 versus 500 is the way to go i did see a fair amount of comments on
[5003.10 → 5007.74] like maybe there should have been a better explainer at the beginning uh because i didn't understand what
[5007.74 → 5013.18] what the video was about telescope says you called everyone out for making the worst choice
[5013.18 → 5018.94] you made your audience butt hurt i am in this tweet and don't like it that's probably a good point too
[5018.94 → 5025.90] like are we so then is part of this that people are watching tech tips just to be just to know
[5025.90 → 5032.70] their choice was validated as opposed to we've known that forever that has been true i can know
[5032.70 → 5038.86] something i can know something cognitively without fully we legit talked about that being willing to
[5038.86 → 5040.38] accept that NCI
[5040.38 → 5048.78] that makes me sad though yeah i know but why aren't we allowed to say hey this thing that's
[5048.78 → 5055.50] super popular is not that great like man do you remember when probably about like nine years ago
[5055.50 → 5064.70] atom 50s these garbage headphones like popped off in popularity because of some like i don't know
[5064.70 → 5069.82] they just they got a lot of attention let's just say they got a lot of attention for a little while and
[5069.82 → 5074.46] you and i were both kind of sitting there going like what like people buy these because
[5074.46 → 5078.62] they're disposable rubbish that's why they use them in the studio not because they're good what is
[5078.62 → 5086.22] happening right now um and i do genuinely think if we had come out and made a video when that trend
[5086.22 → 5091.58] took off that was like the atom 50s are not very good and people need to stop buying them we probably
[5091.58 → 5099.66] would have just gotten destroyed i think it's one of the two you either are right after or are
[5099.66 → 5104.94] the turn of the tide, or you get slaughtered one of the two if you're the turn of the tide than your
[5104.94 → 5109.98] video is going to explode but if people aren't ready for it yet so you're not the turn of the
[5109.98 → 5114.70] tide then they'll just crap on you Isaac v says it was hard to follow you scrambled a lot of parts and
[5114.70 → 5120.14] i didn't really get what was happening um by the way i would like a lot more technical details and what
[5120.14 → 5125.98] they're about okay well so those two things are definitely not going to work together um a ton more
[5125.98 → 5131.82] technical details is uh is going to make it a little harder to follow i can i can promise
[5131.82 → 5138.78] you that but i do agree that kind of like in the last scrapyard wars where we went back we basically
[5138.78 → 5143.34] sent the edit back to the kitchen you never saw the original edit i sent the edit back to the kitchen i
[5143.34 → 5149.90] said look you guys take however much time you need and make sure that we have these on-screen visuals
[5149.90 → 5155.50] that make it really clear what parts we have now what we've added what we're subtracting who we're
[5155.50 → 5161.58] negotiating with and where the money stands and even then one prominent viewer couldn't figure
[5161.58 → 5167.58] out that i was never at a negative balance so yes that's in spite of our best you were it's in
[5167.58 → 5172.94] spite of our best efforts you were shifty says i totally watch reviews for things I've already bought
[5173.82 → 5182.14] and that's that sort of validates your validation seeking i sometimes do too, but it's not necessarily
[5182.14 → 5188.86] it's like kind of to see where it's at if that makes sense um and there's there are products where
[5188.86 → 5197.10] like you know I'll do some research on it, I'll buy it I'll try it out and I'm like yeah like it's its
[5197.10 → 5201.42] working, but you know it's not 100 and then I'll see some new product comes out it'll get compared
[5201.42 → 5206.30] against that new product and then I'll be like ah yeah okay i probably should have waited this isn't great
[5206.30 → 5214.46] like i allow my opinion to be changed um or honestly I'll sometimes buy something someone
[5214.46 → 5218.14] will review it against something else and say that it's crap versus the thing that they like
[5218.14 → 5224.06] and I'll be like yeah i just don't agree but like that's fine Tim says there was a bit of difficulty
[5224.06 → 5227.98] when you were between the two systems like you had the centre channel from this one but the receiver
[5227.98 → 5232.46] from another one i had a bit of difficulty knowing where the value was halfway through but it all kind
[5232.46 → 5238.46] of came together at the end and i think that is probably another like gold star good comment um
[5239.74 → 5249.58] because i still make videos with the intention that people watch the whole thing i know better than
[5249.58 → 5256.38] that yeah yeah you almost have to make like multiple videos you almost yeah you need to have like
[5256.38 → 5263.18] the payoff payoff and it kind of it kind of kills viewer video the 40 viewer video
[5263.18 → 5269.74] the 60 viewer video you can never have like where is he going with this uh it always just has to be
[5269.74 → 5275.26] very clear and that's something that is easy for me to forget because I've always kind of hard to write
[5275.26 → 5282.62] for i imagine um yes and no i mean that that five versus 50 versus 500 format kind of flows yeah is
[5282.62 → 5289.18] so yeah i guess you kind of have to shoehorn into a format that works for it, or it might be more
[5289.18 → 5294.06] difficult to write for i suspect that's the case um sock had to be says the established tiers seemed to
[5294.06 → 5297.66] borrow stuff from the others a bit too much which made it harder to follow for some reason yep i think
[5297.66 → 5302.94] that's i think that's very fair uh in fairness to me, i didn't source the stuff, and so i didn't know
[5302.94 → 5311.10] exactly how it was all going to go together um so i was kind of i was kind of working with um with what i had
[5311.10 → 5318.38] but it's that's really that's really valid and i think that's something that i and the like the
[5318.38 → 5323.74] content team could have worked on ahead of time to make it more accessible by having like a well
[5323.74 → 5327.66] understood format i think that's what it basically boils down to is we could have done a better job
[5327.66 → 5332.78] visually of showing exactly what it was we were doing and having a better established format wouldn't
[5332.78 → 5339.02] hurt i also think that some people kind of got fixated on details that didn't matter i saw some
[5339.02 → 5344.62] people talking about how well i don't even have a home theatre room, and it's like well no that's
[5344.62 → 5349.82] that's not the point we're shooting in here because it's really convenient um, but you could do this
[5349.82 → 5360.78] anywhere and i think a lot of people kind of missed that um oh okay yeah I'm looking into booking a
[5360.78 → 5365.18] ride right now lieutenant salty the video was important too many people have crappy sound bars and have no
[5365.18 → 5370.62] idea what they're missing yeah i mean that was why we did it i thought it was a really important
[5371.26 → 5378.62] video um mantis says are you just focusing too much on a loud minority no because the whole point of
[5378.62 → 5388.38] this is that last thing that i just read so many people have the wrong thing and like need to hear this
[5388.38 → 5393.74] and it might not work for everybody not everybody has the space not everybody has the wife acceptance factor
[5393.74 → 5399.10] to be able to you know put a bunch of random speakers they found on Craigslist and in their
[5399.10 → 5404.54] living space right like it's not going to be applicable to everyone but i do think that before
[5404.54 → 5412.46] you make that decision you should be well-informed that's it i want people to make informed decisions
[5412.46 → 5416.22] and that was why we made that video like if you're interested in tech like
[5416.22 → 5423.90] if you're interested in tech if you don't have a TV even i think it can still be an interesting journey
[5423.90 → 5428.54] to see what someone would do to set up that type of system yeah because surely you might have friends
[5429.34 → 5434.46] and you want to you want to be the knowledgeable tech expert in your group right i assume right like I'm
[5434.46 → 5442.70] i think so right okay all right why don't we jump into our next topic traffic's looking good i can leave
[5442.70 → 5450.54] slightly later why we weren't able to say more oh all right great let's do let's do another topic like
[5450.54 → 5457.42] that hooray um so a lot of people last week were upset frustrated disappointed that we weren't able to
[5457.42 → 5463.02] say more about the channel hiatuses last week and there are two main reasons uh number one is that
[5463.02 → 5470.46] it's the law um and it's funny i ended up kind of in exchanges with a couple of people where i said
[5470.46 → 5477.90] that, and they were like yeah but i was like no there is no yeah but yeah it is just the law about
[5477.90 → 5485.02] certain things it's its completely inflexible i cannot disclose literally anything about someone else's
[5485.58 → 5489.98] personal life including their employment status i was just going to say and to be honest for
[5489.98 → 5496.38] good reason sometimes it would be nice if you could but that the law should exist and that's number two
[5496.38 → 5502.46] because it's like the right thing to do um like let's say let's say hypothetically that you were no
[5502.46 → 5509.26] longer at your job tomorrow whether you quit or you were laid off, or you were fired sort of immaterial um
[5510.06 → 5514.14] during your exit interview the hr manager asks you hey do you mind if we talk about the
[5514.14 → 5523.74] circumstances on our podcast you would think they lost their minds right, but that is what
[5524.46 → 5531.66] a not insignificant number of people were asking me to do to be fair about me in particular i wouldn't
[5531.66 → 5539.18] necessarily think that, but it would still be the law yes um, and it doesn't matter how much anyone
[5539.18 → 5545.10] externally feels like they're entitled to it, they're not yeah they're not entitled to it 100
[5545.10 → 5549.98] um i saw some suggestions that we just provide information about the folks that we're parting
[5549.98 → 5556.78] amicably with for example nope well we always try to part amicably, but it's not always possible and the
[5556.78 → 5562.86] issue there is that if we acknowledge some folks and not others it's pretty easy to do the math
[5562.86 → 5570.62] um simple deductive logic and then uh and then the conjecture starts right we used to talk about
[5570.62 → 5576.30] stuff way more like we'd bring people onto the podcast on their last day or like nick van Burke
[5576.30 → 5581.98] for example is an example he for example is an example yeah he made like a farewell video on
[5581.98 → 5587.26] channel super fun um but what we've realized over time is that it's not a sustainable practice because
[5587.26 → 5594.62] because as soon as there isn't a farewell video or an announcement or whatever the case may be
[5594.62 → 5602.62] um people start speculating and the and the rumour mill spins so much faster than we can possibly
[5602.62 → 5610.38] respond to any of it um i also saw some folks that were asking for way more detail about the business
[5610.38 → 5618.46] decision side of things again though let's put yourself in their shoes okay Luke you are no longer
[5618.46 → 5624.30] working on a project okay and someone else who has a way louder megaphone than you goes and talks about
[5624.30 → 5627.74] whatever it is that led for your project to be shelved or cancelled or whatever else
[5629.82 → 5636.30] yeah do you think that would reflect on you a little bit possibly maybe yes it could
[5636.30 → 5644.30] affect uh future employment potential um it it would be a blow to morale immediately for
[5644.30 → 5651.26] sure i would be frustrated about that because like there's almost no way that they're going to say
[5651.26 → 5663.34] everything and there's no way that we're going to say like we if something got cancelled right almost
[5663.34 → 5669.90] certainly there was something that went wrong with it at some point in some way uh or right so if i
[5669.90 → 5676.54] were to say like hey um we're going to talk about all the uh completely unsustainable practices at
[5676.54 → 5683.98] float plane that led for it to be shelved nice you're going to be like excuse me yeah um and then and
[5683.98 → 5690.70] then right it creates this like this background drama um well you were supposed to be the business arm
[5690.70 → 5699.26] exactly, exactly which you know is valid um also float plane is not unsustainable the reason we're
[5699.26 → 5704.46] using Luke as an example and the reason we're using his project as an example is just illustrative
[5704.46 → 5711.02] it's to show you guys why these conversations don't take place in public and shouldn't and just because
[5711.02 → 5716.54] we've made mistakes in the past doesn't mean that we should just continue to make them
[5716.54 → 5725.18] in the name of like what morbid curiosity like that's not that's not a good reason um so I'm
[5725.18 → 5730.06] really sorry to have disappointed some of you um looking at the comments from last week's wan show
[5730.62 → 5736.94] quite a few members of our community were extremely upset and i think that a big part of that is on me
[5736.94 → 5743.58] i should have explained this in more detail um i do this thing sometimes where i think that stuff is
[5743.58 → 5750.38] sort of self-evident um and it's not because people live in all kinds of different places
[5751.02 → 5756.78] around the world where laws and norms are different um people come from all different walks
[5756.78 → 5763.66] of life uh people have their own value systems um so to me this one was obvious based on all the
[5763.66 → 5768.14] experience that I've had doing it the other way and seeing what an absolute clusterfuck it is
[5768.14 → 5776.46] um you guys don't have that experience so you didn't know um this isn't a choice that helps
[5777.34 → 5783.02] i don't benefit from not offering explanations or justifications for the actions of our team or our
[5783.02 → 5788.30] company that that that doesn't help me uh when the rumour mill swirls because i can't give additional
[5788.30 → 5796.38] details about something i don't benefit guys um, but it is a choice that is designed not for my benefit
[5797.02 → 5802.54] not for your benefit it's designed to minimize the impact on our team members both current and former
[5803.50 → 5806.86] don't expect this policy to be altered going forward because you'd be wrong
[5809.66 → 5817.18] cool good chat yeah do you want to talk about uh full screen ads for copilot plus pcs on Windows 10 so
[5817.18 → 5823.98] sick this is pretty cool Microsoft is aggressively prompting Windows 10 users to upgrade employing full
[5823.98 → 5830.38] screen ads that highlight Windows 11 features particularly those on copilot plus pcs these ads
[5830.38 → 5837.50] coincide with the approaching end of free security updates for Windows 10 in October 2025 while an
[5837.50 → 5845.26] extended security update or esu program exists for a fee the ads predominantly push new pc purchases
[5845.98 → 5851.50] this aggressive marketing tactic isn't new for Microsoft they've used similar methods for past OS
[5851.50 → 5857.18] upgrades um sometimes just forcing them on you anyway and users can still upgrade to Windows 11
[5857.18 → 5863.74] directly on compatible pcs as an alternative discussion question is where's the limit every
[5863.74 → 5869.10] mainstream non-linear operating system and even some of the Linux-based ones would fall under the
[5869.10 → 5877.34] definition of adware at this point uh yeah yeah definitely where's my iPhone here hold on i haven't used
[5877.34 → 5883.26] macOS do they have ads baked into macOS i have literally check this out hold on hold
[5883.26 → 5890.30] on give me a sec give me a sec check this out i didn't notice any uh i have left them because
[5890.30 → 5896.14] i wanted to i wanted to remember how many there were i have macOS doesn't have ads so that's not
[5896.14 → 5903.74] that's not correct i have three macOS never prompts you to like buy iCloud are you sure uh no what I'm
[5903.74 → 5909.26] saying okay fair enough what I'm saying is that uh windows has other ads well there are bakes in ads
[5909.26 → 5915.26] from everybody it's not even just their own stuff yeah i I'm sorry but i don't I don't I don't have
[5915.26 → 5920.14] i don't think there's i don't draw a distinction that's fair enough um okay so uh so on iOS right
[5920.14 → 5925.10] now my Apple account suggestions i have three persistent notifications in my settings app for this
[5925.74 → 5932.38] um my iPhone's not backed up okay that's valid however my second notification is your iPhone can't be
[5932.38 → 5939.18] backed up upgrade for a dollar 29 a month and then my third notification is some iCloud data isn't
[5939.18 → 5944.54] sinking which again is related to me not having enough storage with the which they have kindly
[5944.54 → 5951.26] offered to solve for me for money um and then i have I mean that is how that would work i have three
[5951.26 → 5958.54] well no they could allow me to quickly easily back up to my NAS or my computer remember you do that in
[5958.54 → 5964.30] another way remember back i mean maybe but i don't have I don't have an ad from apple about that
[5964.30 → 5969.90] apple doesn't notify me that that's a possibility uh so is this in your settings thing or yeah i don't
[5969.90 → 5973.82] know it's right it's in my well no i got notifications for them at some point okay oh yeah
[5973.82 → 5980.78] and then i have uh i have three notifications for services included with purchase let's see what do i
[5980.78 → 5986.94] have I get Apple TV free for three months uh i get Apple news plus purchase of the phone yeah but of
[5986.94 → 5992.54] course I'm going to have to sign up for a subscription that is going to it's a very generous three months
[5992.54 → 5999.90] thank you very much for after my you know 1100 or 1200 phone or whatever this is um but uh I'm gonna
[5999.90 → 6005.50] end up I'm going to end up with subscriptions at some point um yeah people are really mad about you uh
[6005.50 → 6013.50] i bet about you thinking that like they shouldn't offer or okay hold on hold on okay guys no
[6013.50 → 6020.62] no, no i am not i am not necessarily saying that apple should be well no i think i yeah i think they
[6020.62 → 6027.58] should be been forced to present me with uh with an alternative option no actually no i do
[6027.58 → 6032.54] know what i do think that uh one person's just particularly mad because apple's limit has been five
[6032.54 → 6037.26] gigs basically forever, and they've done that intentionally knowing that you're going to have to
[6037.26 → 6043.74] buy yeah, but they don't have to provide that no but i think the thing that's i think the thing that
[6043.74 → 6049.58] is bad is that they don't give me a free alternative if they're going to give you a native
[6049.58 → 6055.82] notification yes and not give a free alternative that's pretty annoying if it's just in your settings
[6055.82 → 6060.62] thing, and it's like hey you could do this that's not too big of a deal to me personally but giving you
[6060.62 → 6064.94] notifications yeah it breaks that line especially because they used to you used to be able to
[6064.94 → 6070.46] quickly and easily just plug a cable into your computer and back up to iTunes yeah yeah but no
[6070.46 → 6077.74] they want you to buy cloud storage now um people are saying you can back up your phone over USB still
[6077.74 → 6082.22] so i guess the frustrating thing is just that they aren't presenting that oh apparently apple's being
[6082.22 → 6088.54] sued over this in the UK oh that's hilarious okay so i was uh
[6090.86 → 6094.54] yeah you can still use iTunes so that's good they just don't tell you
[6095.42 → 6099.50] so back to what i said in the beginning i think they should present you with the free option yeah
[6099.50 → 6103.10] cool rather than just saying hey oh no oh my god your iPhone's not backed up
[6104.46 → 6110.78] buy storage buy cloud storage from us wow good guy UK good job
[6113.10 → 6118.22] well that's a valid reason to want usb3 on the iPhone i actually didn't really think about that when we uh
[6118.22 → 6124.22] when we talked about the um the original implementation of USB on the iPhone 15 family
[6125.02 → 6130.70] i didn't think about faster backups with the pro versions that have uh i believe it's five gigabit
[6130.70 → 6137.50] per second right is it five or ten i think it's five pixel bugs you to buy drive storage um
[6138.54 → 6145.34] but one kind of point that i will give to them and i don't know if iOS does this is it will also suggest
[6145.34 → 6153.74] that you like delete old photos that it thinks are like just of garbage um if it's like a
[6153.74 → 6157.34] parking location or something that you like it doesn't think you need any more it'll be like hey
[6157.34 → 6161.18] you can get rid of all this stuff or like hey you haven't opened this app in like a year you should
[6161.18 → 6165.50] just uninstall it like it'll give you suggestions on reducing you're the amount of data that you have
[6165.50 → 6170.78] which i think is kind of neat, but they do try to push you to buy more sumo star in float plane
[6170.78 → 6174.94] chat made a perfect point what's really ridiculous is they've had time machine on
[6174.94 → 6181.90] macOS for like a bazillion year and didn't ever let you do that on the iPhone there is absolutely
[6182.54 → 6188.86] no reason from like an ecosystem user experience standpoint that i shouldn't be able to just arrive
[6188.86 → 6193.82] at home and my iPhone shouldn't just Wi-Fi sync to my time machine that i literally already have
[6193.82 → 6197.74] because i literally already have a mac apparently apple does that too i don't know i don't use iOS i
[6197.74 → 6202.62] wasn't saying in contrast to apple i was just saying that i do like that they do that to be
[6202.62 → 6207.58] clear we started this segment with like every mainstream operating system yeah is functionally
[6207.58 → 6213.50] adware now yeah um, and it's its really frustrating apparently you can Wi-Fi sync to iTunes well why not
[6213.50 → 6221.02] like why not time machine is there a reason to not be able to do that to my NAS that supports time
[6221.02 → 6225.02] machine i don't know man i just
[6227.42 → 6234.86] it just it doesn't seem it doesn't seem intuitive anyone's fighting that to me deep blue says at Luke
[6234.86 → 6239.18] why does the pixel not prompt me to add a different cloud account like Dropbox or next cloud when i don't
[6239.18 → 6246.62] have enough drive storage I'm not I'm not defending google in this isn't this isn't man you start
[6246.62 → 6252.78] talking about android or iOS and people just immediately um if it's this isn't oh Wi-Fi
[6252.78 → 6258.54] sync to iTunes versus the other is apparently not automatic um and archangel of death says it would be
[6258.54 → 6263.34] too convenient of an alternative to buying more iCloud yes, yes that's that's the whole point that
[6263.34 → 6267.10] that's what we're trying to say also i don't want to back up to my desktop pc because i don't want to
[6267.10 → 6272.94] have a raid array in my desktop pc i want to back up to my NAS i want to use time machine like if i was an
[6272.94 → 6277.66] apple user that is what i would want i would want it to go to time machine that would be sick
[6277.66 → 6283.18] what's also super time machine is cool time machine has always been cool to be honest is so cool and
[6283.18 → 6288.62] it's like it's not even it's one of those things that's not even like unique like snapshot based
[6288.62 → 6294.94] backup tools that existed for a billion years it's good, and it's integrated yeah um and the only reason
[6294.94 → 6301.82] for them to not build a good integrated thing is so that they can sell you their own storage
[6301.82 → 6309.50] solution their own cloud storage yeah um anyway this is super cool this is the last thing that we
[6309.50 → 6315.42] really need to talk about before you go have you seen the land party house i was wondering if you're
[6315.42 → 6323.26] going to see this yes i have what the heck you should like go or something i would actually love to the
[6323.26 → 6331.58] way pretty cool dude the way that this room folds up dude it's so sick and stealthier yeah you can so
[6331.58 → 6336.38] so closed station to the right it just looks like the wall, and you can see so the doors at the
[6336.38 → 6343.50] bottom support the desk like oh man this is so really cool incredibly thoughtful DDR panels under the
[6343.50 → 6350.14] floor they show someone actually using them later cool um the upstairs office we can gain here too
[6350.14 → 6355.90] yep and there's uh there's keyboard like uh what looks like uh pull out keyboard trays or no that might
[6355.90 → 6359.42] just be keyboard storage I'm not sure because this one's just kind of sitting here like it's even
[6359.42 → 6370.62] better than that that is so cool flip up monitors that is wild oh wait yeah yeah yeah wow so that was
[6370.62 → 6376.30] literally a keyboard you saw they just flip it up that is so cool this is just extra i hadn't looked
[6376.30 → 6381.26] through the whole thing pre-show because i wanted to i wanted to do it live cable management stealthy
[6381.26 → 6388.54] stealthy absolutely love it killer conduit look at this look at this they've got actual like
[6388.54 → 6394.78] cable trays up in the ceiling just like you have in like a data centre call rooms like they're in an
[6394.78 → 6402.62] office look at this that's so sick look at this is hilarious 20 identical machines personal desktops
[6403.34 → 6410.86] door leads to the hot side oh my goodness this is so cool dude it's wicked
[6411.50 → 6417.74] this is so cool apparently it was like a million dollars yeah uh egads this photo has made a lot of
[6417.74 → 6425.26] network engineers angry oh because they're not using a patch panel response in the q an okay yeah this
[6425.26 → 6432.62] was a mistake I'm a software guy yeah fair enough sounds good got you two gigabits per second
[6432.62 → 6437.66] fibre internet this is crazy look at this can you imagine like working at the know the micro centre
[6437.66 → 6444.62] yeah when someone comes in like hey I'll take everything yeah, thank you how many uh I'd like to
[6444.62 → 6452.54] I'd like to buy a 40 70 how many yes yeah um that was I guarantee you that was fun as hell
[6453.90 → 6461.58] assembly yeah man dude look at this space it's just so it's so enticing yeah beautiful
[6461.58 → 6469.10] the house has normal parts too yeah love to see it dude look at this yep cat door leads into the
[6469.10 → 6474.54] kids bedrooms i love it i have wanted to do this since before we moved into our new place
[6475.10 → 6478.30] like little cat shelves and stuff on the wall just haven't gotten around to it
[6479.74 → 6485.26] apparently one of their parents is like um like works in architectural design or something sorry
[6485.26 → 6491.74] Cloudflare oh no, no no, no no that oh i understand yeah and and and kind of helped with this and has
[6491.74 → 6496.30] like designed some pretty cool stuff got a couple work from home call rooms clearly does a good job
[6496.30 → 6502.46] cat restrooms like really man seriously though if i were to design my own house from scratch i would
[6502.46 → 6507.82] 100 do it if you never have to look at it and smell it like man cats are like the best pets ever
[6507.82 → 6514.62] the worst thing about them is the litter dude so cool oh it's space under the stairwells
[6515.26 → 6521.02] dude i could totally convert one of those spaces in my place to uh to a cat bathroom
[6522.94 → 6526.70] dude the downstairs one definitely i should do that and then and the main stairwell
[6528.94 → 6533.10] i could totally make a little door in there and i don't know how humans would access it but cats
[6533.10 → 6544.14] definitely could um a couple guest rooms dude this roof deck like what like freaking what oh yeah amazing
[6544.14 → 6552.70] um yeah super, super cool project i would love to come check it out I'm in I'm inviting I'm
[6552.70 → 6559.26] inviting myself to go do a tour i mean honestly i think they already did like a great job of doing
[6559.26 → 6564.94] a tour of the place but i still would love to just check it out and geek out over it yeah incredible
[6564.94 → 6570.38] someone one-upped my house land centre oh yeah it's a great title yeah yeah it's a great title
[6570.38 → 6576.06] slightly better than they also they didn't one up it, they like six kind of smashed it yeah, yeah like
[6577.10 → 6582.38] i didn't even think about it all of it just keeps going they're like oh you thought we had one land
[6582.38 → 6592.14] centre yeah what about second land that's crazy i love it so sick I'm I'm I'm it's impressive to see
[6592.14 → 6597.58] anyone that dedicated to pretty much anything yeah and because it happens to be something that
[6598.22 → 6604.54] i think is super cool and I'm also into uh it's that much cooler yeah i think they did an amazing
[6604.54 → 6611.18] amazing job of their setup uh do you need to go you're like getting pretty anxious here so that
[6611.18 → 6618.22] that's fine get out of here okay get out of here uh the topics what do you want yeah I'll finish
[6618.22 → 6622.06] off the topics, and then we can do a couple merch messages i guess it'll just be me and you Dan
[6622.78 → 6628.78] let's see yep that i am there's only a couple I'm so excited about this android will apparently
[6628.78 → 6635.26] finally be able to instantly log you into your apps on new devices this has been a huge pain point for me
[6635.26 → 6642.94] because i have so many like accounts and two factors and dependencies that i basically cannot use
[6642.94 → 6648.78] a phone until probably three or four hours after i first start setting it up, and it's annoying because
[6648.78 → 6654.54] for my job i switch phones a lot more than probably most people and i have like i have like i get like
[6654.54 → 6660.86] anxiety when i need to switch phones google has announced restore credentials which will allow apps
[6660.86 → 6665.74] to seamlessly log users into their accounts on new android device after user restores their apps and data
[6665.74 → 6672.06] from a previous device oh if they can do it in a way that's like secure that's yeah I'm so that's why
[6672.06 → 6677.10] i started looking at this look I'm so excited i just can't hide it i think this particularly for
[6677.10 → 6682.14] reviewers is going to be amazing the user experience should be as if they had already been using the new
[6682.14 → 6686.78] device they will even receive notifications from apps that have not yet been opened on the new device
[6687.50 → 6692.78] how it works signing in to an app on the old device will create a restore key which is stored locally
[6692.78 → 6698.46] and backed up to the cloud apps can opt out of cloud backup don't you dare the restore key is a public
[6698.46 → 6703.66] key compatible passkey slash fido2 backends and uses the same server-side implementation as passkeys
[6704.14 → 6708.06] when setting up the new device the user can restore data from a cloud backup or transfer data locally
[6708.78 → 6714.94] why is googled doing this is a question here i i i don't care I'm not asking that it's great am I am
[6714.94 → 6720.94] i does this counter my rant about google early in the show not doing anything this is innovation i am
[6720.94 → 6725.58] like this is actually pretty cool so excited about this okay my ride's going to be here in two minutes I'm
[6725.58 → 6729.98] going to go according to the android developer blog 40 of people in the US reset or replace
[6729.98 → 6734.78] their smartphone every year that's a big one forget even like getting a new phone the number of
[6735.34 → 6740.30] device manufacturers where you're like hey I'm having a problem and their immediate response is
[6740.30 → 6746.14] to heart to reset the phone it's like do you have any idea how much work homework you just gave me
[6746.14 → 6755.34] resetting my phone that sucks resetting your device sucks oh anyway um they say that making the
[6755.34 → 6758.94] process of logging back into apps on a new phone much faster and easier will help avoid app
[6758.94 → 6763.02] abandonment and user churn okay well that part of it I'm not that into if it's just to like make
[6763.02 → 6770.14] sure i keep paying my subscriptions like a good little boy but um whatever i still love it um
[6771.66 → 6778.30] oh hold on the android developer blog apparently the 40 is probably an overestimate uh our notes
[6778.30 → 6782.06] here say that's probably incorrect various statistics have it more like 10 to 20 max but
[6782.06 → 6788.86] anyway I'm in that 10 to 20, and so I'm extremely excited about this and i can't
[6788.86 → 6794.86] overstate how excited i am about it um our last topic which I'm less excited about is Microsoft
[6794.86 → 6797.66] ignite 2024 there is some good stuff um
[6800.94 → 6806.78] Microsoft announced the windows resiliency initiative uh quick machine recovery allows
[6806.78 → 6811.34] its admins to remotely apply fixes to pcs that can't boot, so this is in response to the crowd
[6811.34 → 6817.10] strike issue earlier this year um Windows 11 enterprise now supports hot patching and public
[6817.10 → 6823.02] preview no reboot required okay that is pretty cool administrator protection standard users can
[6823.02 → 6829.90] temporarily gain admin privileges by authenticating with windows hello and more and then next up we've got
[6829.90 → 6838.78] the windows 365 link this is a little less exciting a 350 edge pc that only serves as a client to access
[6838.78 → 6845.90] a window 365 cloud pc it supports dual 4k monitors has four USB ports and Ethernet port Wi-Fi 6e and
[6845.90 → 6853.90] Bluetooth 5.3 and will be available in April 2025. My only question is why does this need to exist
[6853.90 → 6864.46] in a world where the Mac mini also exists cloud-powered performance the Mac mini is a rip and fast pc for
[6864.46 → 6871.74] yes more but I would say considering that it is a full fat like awesome pc for that price is um
[6873.10 → 6879.42] a lot more compelling but hey we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes Microsoft also announced new
[6879.42 → 6886.38] ai-powered customizable copilot agents that are rolling out in Microsoft 365 aka office like the
[6886.38 → 6890.30] facilitator agent which can take real-time notes during teams meetings and chats which is in public
[6890.30 → 6895.34] preview now we use a third-party tool for that, so this is actually kind of useful for us uh interpreter
[6895.34 → 6898.94] agent which provides real-time speech-to-speech interpretation during meetings even optionally
[6898.94 → 6904.86] simulating the user's voice public preview in early 2025 and an employee self-service agent which can
[6904.86 → 6910.62] answer common policy questions and facilitate tasks related to hr, and it okay maybe I'm maybe I'm
[6910.62 → 6915.66] getting more excited it was just the uh it was just the windows 365 link that I was like yeah um because
[6915.66 → 6922.78] Microsoft 365 is all copilotified Microsoft is adding a little copilot badges to the app icons for word excel
[6922.78 → 6932.62] PowerPoint etc and best of all they're changing the Microsoft 365 logos to something pretty similar to the
[6932.62 → 6943.98] copilot logo but with a m365 badge this is a terrible logo um
[6946.06 → 6953.26] huh oh wow it says please watch this 10 second clip with audio to hear ignite attendees if the enthusiasm
[6953.26 → 6959.02] for this change sure you've got some audio playing some mute uh something else first uh yeah I will do
[6959.02 → 6965.82] that give me one sec i i I would imagine they're going to sound about like what I just sounded like
[6965.82 → 6974.78] looking at that logo i I had not um I had not seen that yet and it is not very good here we go all
[6974.78 → 6982.54] right 10 second clip Dan should it work yep okay here we go icon to the new Microsoft 365 copilot icon
[6982.54 → 7003.34] oh, oh boy wow, wow oof that was the shortest polite applause that I think I have ever heard at a keynote
[7003.34 → 7014.30] wow uh this last part is actually super cool also rolling out now for metaquest 3 and 3s users this
[7014.30 → 7020.22] is the ability to access a local or cloud-based windows instance and interact with multiple virtual
[7020.22 → 7027.02] monitors who that's uh that's looking pretty cool and comes at a much lower price than an apple vision
[7027.02 → 7033.58] pro and a macBook so uh I can see people being pretty stoked on that one as well good gravy was
[7033.58 → 7040.06] that ever savage though wow i I think I might even as much as I don't like it I think I could
[7040.06 → 7046.70] probably muster a little bit more fake enthusiasm than that yikes all right why don't we switch over
[7046.70 → 7051.82] to when after dark Mr Dan lesser can do whoa we need to switch the wan show to this time forever
[7051.82 → 7061.82] our concurrence on YouTube are like 15 20 higher than usual that's higher than uh very high I'm
[7061.82 → 7068.14] showing 16 oh no there we go everybody stop watching uh yeah yeah yeah we should do that
[7068.14 → 7073.50] oh man I don't want to get up early on Fridays though me to this sucks uh it's actually 5 000 YouTube is
[7073.50 → 7079.98] there's an error uh yeah yeah it's a reporting error reporting the dashboard is broken um exactly oh crap
[7079.98 → 7083.66] okay you know what's funny is we always did it at the later time because
[7085.26 → 7091.42] and i I don't want to make anyone else feel unappreciated, but we always did it at the later
[7091.42 → 7101.66] time because um the Australian crew was like so into being able to catch wan show and so vocal about it
[7101.66 → 7109.74] that we picked the afternoon on Fridays because it would be um not a work night for the east coast
[7109.74 → 7115.18] in North America so they could kind of stay up and watch it, and it would be uh in the morning for the
[7115.18 → 7123.98] Australians to watch, and we've just kind of we just kind of um we our European audience was
[7123.98 → 7131.10] a lot less vocal and a lot smaller back then, and so we have always been kind of
[7131.82 → 7137.26] Aussie uh, uh Aussie accommodating, and maybe it's because I don't know maybe it's because
[7137.82 → 7142.86] i kind of think of Australians as probably one of the closest cultures to Canada um
[7143.66 → 7149.10] i maybe I felt like some kinship you know we're both kind of like they're like sorry but with spiders
[7149.10 → 7155.26] yeah we're still kind of commonwealth but like you know kind of king Charles you know like I don't
[7155.26 → 7160.06] know we just always kind of seemed we always kind of seemed on the same page about things but um
[7162.54 → 7168.86] yeah this is wow this is uh this is a lot um this is a lot uh a lot higher viewership than usual i
[7168.86 → 7176.22] haven't looked at the analytics I hadn't either yeah no this is uh concerning huh outlier um okay uh yeah
[7176.22 → 7182.78] maybe who knows well I'm not promising anything because the work week is very challenging here in
[7182.78 → 7189.02] a lot of ways and I'm often mentally exhausted like i to be clear I don't think that I work a hard
[7189.02 → 7195.82] manual labour job or anything like that, but it can be mentally very exhausting and uh early morning on
[7195.82 → 7202.22] my on my Fridays is not my favourite time to have to be like on for two to four hours that's another
[7202.22 → 7205.90] thing too is doing it at the end of the workday on Friday means that we can just kind of like
[7206.54 → 7211.82] not disturb anybody, and we can go for as long as we need to until we're blocking like three or four
[7211.82 → 7215.90] sets right now yeah we can't do a short circuit nobody can come in the building we can't do tech
[7215.90 → 7221.74] linked nobody can be upstairs uh why do you keep moving yourself you're the're my only co-host
[7221.74 → 7228.22] right now oh yeah I keep forgetting about that uh I should try and move the camera over slightly if I can
[7228.22 → 7234.22] do that with this might not be a terrible idea anyway yeah so okay I didn't consider that so
[7234.22 → 7239.26] there definitely won't be any changes anytime soon but um yeah I'm definitely I'm definitely
[7239.26 → 7244.78] liking you all hanging out with us that's pretty cool it's kind of fun all right want to hit me with a
[7244.78 → 7249.42] a handful of merch messages and then I guess we should get out of people's way yeah probably
[7249.42 → 7255.10] uh let's see with graphics card running hotter and the 4090 already being a 60 millimetre thick
[7255.10 → 7259.82] will we eventually see tower coolers as standard would you consider banking one together for a current or
[7259.82 → 7268.94] next gen I mean dude i i I would have a few short years ago I would have said no that's just a silly
[7268.94 → 7275.02] mod that people do and uh we're always going to need to keep our slots open for additional add-in cards and
[7276.94 → 7285.02] what adding cards do people even install anymore what are we supposed to like most motherboards like they
[7285.02 → 7289.58] they high-end motherboards this is a funny thing it used to be pisses me off so much dude remember
[7289.58 → 7295.26] remember when high-end motherboards had more PCIE slots yeah I will pay more for extra because I need
[7295.26 → 7301.98] a lot of PCI cards sometimes yeah now it's like actually one yeah basic boards especially like mate
[7301.98 → 7309.50] mate is one that drives me absolutely bonkers because the high-end ones will remove PCIE slots but
[7309.50 → 7314.14] they're not even full-size ATX boards so they don't have like five or six m.2 slots on them so I'm sitting
[7314.14 → 7319.90] here going what did you do with the lanes why am I paying extra for this if you're not putting
[7319.90 → 7325.90] like a PLX chip on it and giving me all the slots like what happened basic mate boards have all
[7325.90 → 7333.74] the slots what's happening here um exactly and so yeah now that this trend of people only install GPUs
[7333.74 → 7339.18] in their systems because GPUs cost so much we can't afford other cards just not the real reason
[7339.18 → 7346.46] there but I don't know it might be a contributor um I don't know I mean what I will say is that i
[7346.46 → 7352.62] wouldn't be surprised if 5090 coolers are about the same size as 4090 coolers even with the rumoured
[7352.62 → 7359.02] increase in TDP and the reason for that is that the rumour is that 4090 coolers were designed for a much
[7359.02 → 7365.02] higher TDP because NVIDIA kind of rug pulled the board partners on what the exact heat output of the card
[7365.02 → 7370.46] was going to be so I don't think they're going to get bigger in the next generation but with that
[7370.46 → 7376.30] said man I don't think anything's off the table anymore oh man dude how cool would it be Dan if we
[7376.30 → 7381.18] had uh oh I guess I should look this way at you even though you're physically over there yeah sure that
[7381.18 → 7388.94] works uh oh my goodness uh how cool would it be if we had a standard where you're kind of like the old
[7388.94 → 7395.82] trash can mac pro right where you've got your CPU socket, and then you've got your GPU and the die is
[7395.82 → 7401.50] on the top, and you could just do like a gigantic combo cooler and then just have like front to back
[7401.50 → 7407.26] airflow that goes right through it oh yeah I'd like that or that'd be sick like you could have your CPU
[7407.26 → 7412.14] cooler here and then maybe another thing that kind of wraps around it yeah so you can still remove them
[7412.14 → 7418.70] or you could move the CPU socket more to the right of the board yeah uh, and then you could um because
[7418.70 → 7423.74] you'd have such a large cooler like a GPU even though it kicks out so much heat is a larger die
[7423.74 → 7429.58] it's easier to move the heat away from so you could cool your smaller die CPU where you really need that
[7429.58 → 7436.46] temperature differential between the air and the and the fins um or rather and the and the
[7436.46 → 7441.58] and the processor itself, and then you could take that semi-heated air blow that through like a big a
[7441.58 → 7446.54] large cooler for the GPU so you could either do them serial or you could do them uh like
[7446.54 → 7450.06] split like you could have the CPU on the one side and the GPU on the one side, and then you could just
[7450.06 → 7454.22] have like a tunnel that you're blowing air down that kind of cools each on both sides or I think
[7454.22 → 7460.54] probably the most effective design would be like the trash can which really did a great job of cool of
[7460.54 → 7465.26] removing that much heat for its size and for its noise, and then you would just have like heat pipes
[7465.26 → 7470.22] coming off the GPU heat pipes coming off the CPU into this like a great big fin stack that would be
[7470.22 → 7477.50] freaking cool, and maybe we should start seeing like you know CPU chips just come as a chip when
[7477.50 → 7482.86] can we get GPUs that do that oh it's never going to happen I know it would be never going to happen I think
[7482.86 → 7488.62] I think what pisses me off mostly about the new motherboards these days is again yeah like a PCI lanes
[7489.18 → 7498.38] um PCI gen 5 came out all the boards put it on it is has like a thousand PCI gen 4 lanes what speed do uh
[7498.38 → 7506.54] GPUs run out Linus it's PCI gen 4 times 8 for now for now i I would like to see
[7507.98 → 7516.22] I'd like to see the desktop use the additional bandwidth of PCI gen 5 differently I would actually
[7516.22 → 7523.74] rather than see a PCIE by 16 GPU slot I would like to see everyone get together and kind of go hey
[7523.74 → 7530.86] can we all acknowledge that 16 current generation lanes is utterly unnecessary
[7531.90 → 7540.54] and can we start putting 8x slots as our primary GPU slot and using those lanes somewhere else having
[7540.54 → 7549.18] more slots having more Io uh having more storage ports you know i i i but the new consumer
[7549.18 → 7556.78] the PCI 5 came out I need the new nice big thing that's the new number right well hold on there is
[7556.78 → 7565.18] PCI gen 4 times x you know I've got a motherboard that has seven PCI slots uh I know what I'm buying
[7565.18 → 7572.54] average consumer sees top of the line board PCI gen 5 they know that if they don't know that the GPUs
[7572.54 → 7578.62] don't even run at the speeds I have a justification Dan I have a justification for this go for it if i
[7578.62 → 7587.58] still had a 16x slot right PCI gen 5 by 16 and a PCI e gen 6 card comes out right I could take that i
[7587.58 → 7592.94] could put it in my gen 5 slot and I'd still be getting half of its total theoretical bandwidth if we
[7592.94 → 7599.98] move to buy eight interfaces um I will be getting now, and we get like a 16x card and I put it in my 8x
[7599.98 → 7604.30] slot that's a gen old I will be getting a quarter of the theoretical bandwidth which could actually
[7604.30 → 7611.98] impact performance another thing um a lot of the CPU and Northridge like lanes are shared if I put too
[7611.98 → 7619.26] many NVMe drives in it disables PCI slots if I put too many SATA drives in it disables PCI slots what if
[7619.26 → 7625.74] you just give me eight slots on the board, and then we can adjust which ones are active or not dude
[7625.74 → 7629.10] server boards that's like that's kind of what I'm talking about that's basically how they work now
[7629.10 → 7634.22] is you don't even have slots on them, they just have those little um what's that mini whatever
[7634.22 → 7640.30] connector called uh Jake sent me the wildest looking board that was pretty I think it was from as rock
[7640.30 → 7646.46] rack where it just had no slots on it and just the entire bottom of the board was covered in those uh
[7646.46 → 7652.22] those PCIE riser connectors and I was like oh my gosh that's so cool because then you can you just
[7652.22 → 7657.74] design your chassis around that, and you just like carry PCIE wherever you want it storage devices GPUs
[7657.74 → 7663.26] basically uh that would be super nice like taking the PCI standard to its logical conclusion
[7663.26 → 7668.30] and just making everything like an add-in card yeah not oculi it's its it's the newer one i
[7668.30 → 7674.86] it's its escaping me right now um I have no idea yeah i I can't remember no it's not oculi oh yeah
[7674.86 → 7680.70] bifurcation is another huge thing I've got a quad m.2 drive thing in there adding cable cost though is
[7680.70 → 7687.42] gonna is going to kill the deal on consumer like for servers yes but not for yeah, but it gives
[7687.42 → 7694.14] manufacturers the opportunity to sell more dongles yeah I mean think of the dongles I like it, they'll
[7694.14 → 7701.50] love if they'll push it for just that I think case it would really change case design that would be
[7701.50 → 7707.34] that would be super cool if all of a sudden you could kind of like creatively mount cards anywhere
[7707.34 → 7712.78] but looking at how little adoption we've seen for PCIE risers like it's still niche in the small
[7712.78 → 7718.78] form factor space or like the vertical mounts like it's still I would say at most probably one
[7718.78 → 7724.38] percent of pcs if you factor in pre-builds probably less like i I just don't think most people are going
[7724.38 → 7731.90] to be willing to absorb that additional cost probably not all right what else we got today
[7731.90 → 7736.62] okay thanks for the early show now I can watch it work since I work in a data centre myself
[7736.62 → 7743.50] I love that video tour uh was there anything that you learned that you want to apply to your home's
[7743.50 → 7750.06] pool loop uh those leak detection cords are super cool like being able to know exactly where it is but
[7750.06 → 7756.78] but no um the cost of implementing things the way that they do them is why we didn't do it that way
[7756.78 → 7764.62] it's not because we like didn't think of it uh it's yeah it's super cool to like to see it all done right
[7764.62 → 7770.38] I'd say the one thing that we are legitimately considering because we've had multiple power
[7770.38 → 7775.98] outages here at the office in the last couple of weeks because of uh storms in the southwestern
[7775.98 → 7784.78] bc area is diesel generator backups uh we're getting pretty darn tired of our power going out um but
[7786.46 → 7793.18] we can't afford to have you know an on-site you know fuel purifier and like so it's going to be
[7793.18 → 7798.94] someone's job to micromanage like making sure we have non-stale diesel fuel on site all the time and
[7798.94 → 7803.74] I'm just looking at it going we can barely keep our snakes drawers stocked because and that's not
[7803.74 → 7808.62] because you know people like you know do a bad job or something it's just because like we've got a lot
[7808.62 → 7817.50] going on, and it's easy for its easy for just in case we need it stuff to fall by the wayside when
[7817.50 → 7823.74] something else is happening right so i I understand especially if you can't even keep snakes in stock
[7823.74 → 7829.42] which are extremely visible oh yeah you know okay you know why the snakes aren't in stock
[7829.42 → 7836.46] right now i yeah Canada post strike Costco relies on them for delivery so we don't have snakes right
[7836.46 → 7841.58] now like I think our I think our shipment is like one of those limbo shipments where it started before
[7841.58 → 7846.62] the strike ended, and then it was before the strike started and then didn't get completed or something
[7846.62 → 7851.74] i I don't know exactly why I'm piecing this together someone told me that it's to do with the Canada post
[7851.74 → 7856.06] strike and I read an article about how some things are stuck in limbo so I made some assumptions i
[7856.06 → 7860.46] connected some dots, but basically it's something to do with the Canada post strike well we'll call them
[7860.46 → 7866.06] oldies now instead of snakes because it's just been in a warehouse for the last month and a half
[7866.06 → 7872.46] thanks Dan um let's see last one I've got here for you hello gents I think my last merch message
[7872.46 → 7879.26] went astray yes it did I'm sorry about that I own a ZX Spectrum UK competitor to the Commodore 64.
[7879.26 → 7887.82] do you think keyboard computers could ever make a comeback love max um no the keyboard is having become
[7888.46 → 7894.22] such a personal choice like even and I'm not even talking about the people for whom their keyboard is
[7894.22 → 7899.98] is their purest expression of their self you know um I'm talking about just
[7901.18 → 7907.58] low profile high profile jumped no jumped uh positioning of various keys uh keyboards have
[7907.58 → 7915.50] become such a personal choice that i I feel like integrating them into a device would be a fundamental
[7915.50 → 7922.70] error of the greatest magnitude um like even, even mobile devices right like they come with a
[7922.70 → 7927.34] keyboard, but you can absolutely switch it out for a different keyboard a different layout different
[7927.34 → 7936.38] functionality if you want um i just i I don't I don't see us making a return to this and sure yes okay
[7936.38 → 7942.22] you could make it modular kind of like what framework did on the framework 16 but again I look at what
[7942.22 → 7951.18] an outlier the framework 16 is as a laptop with you know a slim modular keyboard um more modularity is
[7951.18 → 7957.58] absolutely absolutely absolutely not the direction that the industry is going and I wouldn't expect that
[7957.58 → 7967.66] trend to reverse anytime soon yeah uh Randall we have no plans for an uh like a formal tool bag at this time
[7967.66 → 7971.18] nothing's impossible, but there's nothing happening at this time
[7971.18 → 7977.66] and I think that's it for the wan show it feels bizarre doesn't it to be done wan show
[7977.66 → 7985.18] I don't like yeah and then go for lunch i have to just what do i don't know I like I feel like
[7985.18 → 7989.98] my day's over, and it's time to go home like this is like like like salivation condition response right
[7989.98 → 7994.62] now yeah I'm ready to I'm sleepy I'm ready to go to bed yeah because like I was talking to Sammy about
[7994.62 → 8002.14] this I've had maybe three or four like single hand Friday nights off in 10 years not even exaggerating
[8002.14 → 8009.82] um so I'm like I just go and like stare at the ceiling all evening yeah because I take my
[8009.82 → 8014.94] my meds too early this morning and I'm wired I told my kids I told my kids that I'm coming home at
[8014.94 → 8022.78] a reasonable time, and they were like why I was like well why do you lie to us daddy yeah no I was like oh
[8022.78 → 8027.02] we're doing wan show in the morning they're like why I'm like because Luke has to catch a flight
[8027.02 → 8031.66] and they're like oh I'm like oh okay maybe I guess you guys have plans on Friday nights i

[8081.74 → 8085.74] well why'd someone tell me it was something to do with Canada post then I don't know blaming you I'm
[8085.74 → 8090.94] going to go speak to that person okay do I have to load a new page like what's what's going on here
[8091.98 → 8098.78] uh okay hello refresh I thought alt f5 is supposed to do like a full refresh
[8098.78 → 8111.66] alt function f5 am i just completely Deeping here Dan uh on what on alt f5 alt f5 is the thing
[8111.66 → 8116.94] to refresh the page right I think that's like is that force refresh well no I thought it was I thought
[8116.94 → 8122.70] is if it's just f5 alt shift f5 I don't know what the oh sorry oh yeah I thought it was all is it shift
[8122.70 → 8127.82] f it's shift f5 good lord for the force yeah okay I haven't had a reason oh crap I haven't had a
[8127.82 → 8132.62] reason to force refresh a page in years and years and years sorry guys very often yeah i
[8135.26 → 8139.34] I don't even know if it works there's no like indicator that it's actually a force refresh i
[8139.34 → 8143.74] don't think it's force refreshing because it's loading its loading the exact same
[8145.10 → 8150.06] thing even if i whether I shift you guys are sure it's not all control is it control
[8150.94 → 8155.34] I think sometimes there's like a shortcut that you hit the refresh icon while holding
[8155.34 → 8159.42] it on a shortcut I don't know if that works okay yeah it seems to be just
[8161.18 → 8166.54] not okay Ltd backpack available now I'm just going to keep clicking stuff until whatever the point is
