It's remarkable how little care Lucas and Linus show about about the WAN Show. One of the most repetitive requests from viewers/listeners is chapters/timestamps, yet still nothing is done about it, despite Linus bragging about how much of a great revenue stream the WAN Show is. Why not pay someone $100 or something per episode to create the chapter marks? Even better, why not use some Whisper + some LLM API with a custom prompt to create the timestamps automatically? Show that you care.

[2024-11-02T07:30:59Z] Video: I Need A Mac To Go With My iPhone - WAN Show November 1, 2024 
For a long time now (1-2yrs+) I've noticed that youtube doesn't list the date of the video upload consistently. I've had times where i was trying to cite a video for a paper, and best case I'd see a "this video was uploaded 1 year ago" but there were also times where i could not find any kind of date. 

Another issue I've been running into occasionally over the last few months is I'd open a video on my phone and it wouldn't display the video duration... More recently I've learned that if i restart YouTube and revisit the video the duration/timestamp info comes back, but still a really annoying bug/"feature"
