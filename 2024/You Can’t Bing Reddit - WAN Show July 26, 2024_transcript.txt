[0.00 --> 2.00]  Welcome to the web...
[2.00 --> 4.40]  Oh, sorry. No, I just... I got confused there.
[4.56 --> 7.34]  I always ask how they're doing and stuff, and I never...
[7.34 --> 10.22]  I thought someone was talking, but I thought I could hear them.
[10.72 --> 12.32]  But I couldn't, just like always.
[12.36 --> 13.84]  We got a great show for you guys today.
[15.00 --> 15.92]  This just in.
[16.28 --> 18.26]  You can't Bing Reddit,
[18.72 --> 21.80]  which on the surface of it is all just nonsense words,
[21.96 --> 23.78]  but when you go a little deeper,
[24.48 --> 25.86]  it looks pretty bad.
[25.98 --> 27.66]  Yeah, search engines other than Google Search
[27.66 --> 30.08]  are now unable to produce results from Reddit
[30.08 --> 32.28]  more recent than a few weeks ago.
[32.40 --> 33.88]  We're going to talk about this in a little bit.
[34.14 --> 36.12]  We also are going to talk about...
[36.12 --> 36.86]  I don't know.
[37.86 --> 39.94]  Oh, LTT is AI now?
[40.28 --> 43.24]  Ah, yes. A bunch of our videos were used to train an AI,
[43.46 --> 45.26]  so I guess we'll chat about that.
[45.30 --> 46.56]  What else we got for today?
[48.32 --> 49.30]  Olympics won.
[49.72 --> 51.98]  The Olympics of esports, including League of Legends,
[52.12 --> 53.72]  Rocket League, Street Fighter, Tekken, iRacing,
[53.72 --> 55.94]  NBA 2K, and FIFA, and more?
[56.14 --> 57.62]  Maybe other stuff is happening?
[57.66 --> 58.14]  I don't know.
[58.48 --> 60.30]  Also, Olympics 2.
[60.76 --> 62.02]  We have multiple Olympics topics.
[62.28 --> 62.64]  Oh, no.
[62.70 --> 66.56]  Apparently, the Canadians spied on opponents with drones.
[67.42 --> 69.38]  I mean, that's kind of technology related, right?
[69.54 --> 70.10]  What are we doing?
[71.12 --> 72.52]  What are we up to?
[73.48 --> 74.34]  What's going on?
[75.28 --> 75.96]  How do we do that?
[75.96 --> 85.26]  I did not inspect the topics ahead of time.
[85.26 --> 101.00]  The show is brought to you today by AG1, Squarespace, Green Man Gaming,
[101.00 --> 104.36]  and, of course, our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[105.16 --> 107.08]  You can't Bing Reddit.
[107.08 --> 107.20]  You can't Bing Reddit.
[107.62 --> 108.28]  That's right.
[108.44 --> 110.96]  Search engines, other than Google Search,
[111.32 --> 115.26]  are now unable to produce results from Reddit more recent than a few weeks ago,
[115.62 --> 119.92]  likely because Reddit has been blocking indexing bots from other companies.
[119.92 --> 123.68]  Google, of course, has an exclusive contract with Reddit.
[123.82 --> 128.02]  So, when we had those conversations about how on earth is Reddit going to be making money?
[129.50 --> 130.30]  Maybe this is how.
[130.30 --> 139.24]  Apparently, this is one of the ways, not just licensing the treasure trove of data that they have to AI companies for training their models,
[139.44 --> 145.88]  but also by apparently making any search engine other than Google nigh unusable.
[146.02 --> 147.58]  I mean, everyone knows the trick.
[147.94 --> 154.08]  Searching for what it is that you need to know and then appending Reddit to it in order to find an answer
[154.08 --> 159.00]  because search engines are basically just sponsored results and garbage now.
[159.00 --> 162.40]  Now, despite maintaining a market share of nearly 92%,
[162.40 --> 169.46]  Google apparently felt that its near monopoly over search may be threatened by advancements by rival AI companies,
[169.56 --> 173.06]  such as OpenAI, who recently unveiled their search GPT prototype,
[173.58 --> 176.82]  and apparently they entered into this agreement.
[176.82 --> 179.40]  Now, our discussion question here is,
[179.60 --> 182.90]  what kind of precedent does this set for the rest of the internet?
[183.18 --> 185.72]  And the answer is a terrible one.
[186.10 --> 187.82]  I mean, I don't think this is even...
[187.82 --> 195.16]  I don't think anyone in good faith would tell me that I'm being all slippery slope fallacy about this
[195.16 --> 199.20]  when I say that if Google were to, say, for example,
[199.74 --> 207.22]  extend this to only allowing a YouTube video search result to be surfaced by their own search engine...
[207.22 --> 211.58]  If that happened, I would not be able to find anything useful on any other search engine.
[211.58 --> 218.92]  Or if Microsoft were to make an exclusive deal with, oh, I don't know...
[218.92 --> 226.80]  Okay, various news media, so that you could only get results from them by searching through the start menu on Windows.
[226.92 --> 234.30]  I mean, turning the internet into this fragmented, walled-off garden is bad enough.
[234.30 --> 241.64]  Doing it with content that was user-generated, that you didn't even pay to create, is so much worse.
[241.64 --> 246.98]  This also, I think, as you were kind of saying, this probably does start an arms race.
[246.98 --> 250.98]  We were struggling to think of one, but Flowplane Chat, and I just lost who said it, sorry.
[250.98 --> 253.98]  But Flowplane Chat pointed out Stack Overflow.
[254.52 --> 259.98]  Like, if Bing gets GitHub and Stack Overflow, and Google gets Reddit and YouTube...
[259.98 --> 267.32]  So you've got the developer search engine, you've got the, you know, angry person in their basement search engine...
[267.32 --> 268.74]  Yep, yep, yep.
[269.16 --> 271.98]  Okay, so Google gets YouTube, Reddit, and, like, Twitter.
[273.36 --> 274.66]  Okay, sounds good.
[274.86 --> 278.32]  Then we can have, like, the boomer search engine, which gets, like, Facebook and...
[278.82 --> 279.18]  Yeah.
[279.76 --> 281.54]  I don't know what else, but something.
[281.90 --> 283.56]  Dude, this is terrible.
[285.02 --> 288.78]  Porto says, Microsoft already owns GitHub, so, yes, that was his point.
[288.78 --> 291.24]  But it's not restricted from Google at this time.
[291.44 --> 291.72]  Yes.
[291.82 --> 295.24]  So if this starts an arm race, they might want to restrict the search results from Google.
[297.60 --> 300.78]  Like, I'm just, I'm trying to think, and, like...
[301.90 --> 303.64]  It just sucks.
[304.14 --> 304.82]  It just sucks.
[304.88 --> 312.82]  Yeah, there is absolutely no argument that you can make for how this is a good thing,
[312.92 --> 315.38]  and this is something that anybody should support.
[315.38 --> 322.38]  Now, fortunately, the FTC apparently has already caught wind of this and is...
[323.04 --> 323.34]  Hold on.
[323.40 --> 326.58]  I'm going to double-check this, because it might have actually been something else.
[326.66 --> 327.32]  Google, Reddit.
[327.40 --> 328.44]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[328.46 --> 329.22]  I'm just going to make sure.
[331.04 --> 331.42]  Into deals.
[331.56 --> 332.38]  Licensing its users.
[332.54 --> 332.66]  Reddit.
[332.76 --> 333.58]  Almost a month ago.
[333.72 --> 334.50]  The arrangement will give...
[334.50 --> 335.20]  Hold on, hold on.
[335.48 --> 335.72]  Okay.
[336.20 --> 337.06]  I'm just going to make sure.
[337.06 --> 342.58]  Given the novel nature of these technologies, we're not surprised.
[342.70 --> 343.38]  They have Reddit wrote...
[343.38 --> 348.60]  Okay, no, this was around them licensing the user data for AI platforms,
[348.72 --> 352.20]  so I don't think it's actually related to this particular one.
[352.20 --> 360.02]  But, thankfully, Reddit licensing their user data is at least on the FTC's radar,
[360.02 --> 368.82]  and hopefully they can continue to keep an eye on this and make sure that this doesn't become a thing.
[371.12 --> 372.24]  Handyman says...
[372.24 --> 373.08]  Han Floatplane says,
[373.18 --> 374.18]  But money, Linus.
[374.30 --> 374.98]  But money.
[374.98 --> 377.72]  I don't know.
[377.98 --> 380.06]  Corey's the name says Reddit's destroying itself.
[380.18 --> 382.84]  I've been using it nearly daily for almost 15 years.
[382.94 --> 384.04]  It's very rapidly declining.
[384.16 --> 386.02]  It'll be dig soon and something will replace...
[386.02 --> 386.46]  What?
[386.94 --> 388.30]  What will replace it?
[388.38 --> 393.54]  I haven't seen anything gain anywhere near any kind of momentum.
[394.10 --> 395.64]  And Luke and I have talked about this,
[395.64 --> 403.26]  but the incumbent momentum feels so much greater today than it was even five years ago.
[403.54 --> 403.62]  Yeah.
[403.62 --> 406.34]  Because of the historical knowledge.
[406.54 --> 409.14]  That's the value of a site like Reddit.
[409.26 --> 412.66]  It's not even the active user count today, necessarily.
[413.12 --> 418.88]  It's the user-generated content that's been posted over the last 15 years.
[419.00 --> 420.04]  Those questions and answers.
[420.24 --> 420.86]  That discussion.
[421.12 --> 423.18]  There's also been a shift in how people use the internet.
[423.96 --> 428.20]  Users now are more or less unwilling to go to a variety of websites.
[428.88 --> 433.44]  Users will have their small subset, often a very small amount.
[433.62 --> 436.74]  Like five to ten sites that they actually go to.
[437.08 --> 445.60]  Like you might be a person who goes to Reddit, Imgur, YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook.
[445.86 --> 446.26]  I don't know.
[446.60 --> 449.32]  But you like do not use websites outside of that.
[449.32 --> 451.60]  It's a huge thing.
[451.72 --> 452.92]  A lot of it is user behavior.
[452.92 --> 457.04]  And it makes it really, really, really hard for alternative sites to show up.
[457.38 --> 463.94]  Because if you wanted to start an alternative of YouTube, people aren't going to get off of Twitch and YouTube.
[464.22 --> 466.74]  They will not get off of those websites to view yours.
[466.80 --> 470.56]  Even if you have the best version of a certain type of content, they just won't watch it.
[470.56 --> 476.18]  Yeah, we talked about this a fair bit when we were discussing the challenges facing gun creators on YouTube right now.
[476.30 --> 480.00]  Like the obvious solution to people who don't know what they're talking about is,
[480.38 --> 482.30]  well, why don't you all just go upload somewhere else?
[482.38 --> 483.24]  There's strength in numbers.
[483.48 --> 484.72]  They've tried that multiple times.
[484.74 --> 486.36]  But your numbers are so small.
[486.58 --> 486.76]  Yeah.
[486.94 --> 488.56]  They're small and they're meaningless numbers.
[488.56 --> 496.20]  And when you're dealing with stuff like video delivery on the internet, the cost savings comes in massive, massive volume.
[496.52 --> 496.68]  Yeah.
[497.36 --> 498.30]  Yahoo search.
[498.50 --> 499.38]  Ask Chiefs.
[500.70 --> 502.64]  Well, this is the thing, though.
[502.74 --> 503.94]  It's restricted from all others.
[503.94 --> 508.56]  This is what opens this up very obviously to antitrust.
[508.66 --> 509.48]  Like, I don't even know.
[509.64 --> 513.78]  I don't even understand why Google bothered to try to sign this deal.
[514.00 --> 516.16]  Because they're already dominant today.
[516.16 --> 530.42]  They don't have like a nascent competitor to crush right now that, you know, they could effectively force out of business while any antitrust litigation makes its way through the system.
[530.74 --> 530.86]  Right?
[530.94 --> 534.60]  Like, why bother with this right now?
[534.82 --> 538.60]  Because of OpenAI's search GPT is what this...
[538.60 --> 542.32]  Sure, but you're not going to starve out OpenAI.
[542.60 --> 542.76]  Yeah.
[542.88 --> 544.56]  I mean, they have Microsoft's backing.
[544.56 --> 546.56]  They're literally either...
[546.56 --> 548.72]  Are they behind NVIDIA or ahead of Apple?
[548.84 --> 552.42]  I don't know where they are right now, but they're one of the three most valuable companies in the world.
[552.96 --> 560.26]  This isn't some startup that you can damage by buying protection for your monopoly until they just go away.
[560.34 --> 563.24]  OpenAI's not going away anytime soon.
[563.68 --> 568.32]  So, what is the point of even doing this?
[568.32 --> 572.66]  I do think Google is in a really bad spot in general.
[573.62 --> 575.58]  So, they might be kind of grasping at straws.
[575.68 --> 576.90]  Search has never been worse.
[577.68 --> 579.66]  Drive search is functionally useless.
[580.30 --> 581.88]  Gmail search is really bad.
[582.08 --> 584.08]  Like, all the search products right now are rough.
[585.26 --> 587.18]  Dude, never mind the search products.
[587.62 --> 590.60]  Google can't search for s*** right now.
[590.92 --> 591.14]  Yeah.
[591.14 --> 593.14]  Do you remember...
[593.14 --> 595.28]  Okay, this one can do it.
[595.42 --> 595.70]  Gmail search...
[595.70 --> 596.68]  The search bar at the top of Gmail.
[596.84 --> 597.50]  Dude, dude.
[597.82 --> 600.42]  I was trying to find...
[600.42 --> 601.96]  Okay, there's a Trello card.
[602.06 --> 604.12]  We use Trello for task management.
[604.36 --> 605.56]  Well, some of our teams do.
[605.62 --> 606.68]  We have some streamlining to do.
[606.84 --> 609.04]  The point is, we have a Trello license.
[609.88 --> 611.90]  I was trying to find a Trello card.
[611.90 --> 614.10]  And it used to be...
[614.10 --> 615.46]  And this is a super convenient feature.
[615.56 --> 617.64]  That you could just start typing in the top of Chrome.
[618.16 --> 625.66]  And if you typed in keywords that were similar to the URL of a page that you've visited in the past,
[625.80 --> 629.66]  it would just auto-populate and it would find it and you could just press enter.
[630.00 --> 633.34]  So, what I was looking for was a card called LMG Review.
[634.30 --> 638.12]  So, that's what we call my final review pass of an LTT video.
[638.12 --> 643.74]  So, once everyone else has done quality and fact-checking passes and I'm looking to see if I catch anything.
[644.46 --> 645.98]  So, I just wanted to go to that tab.
[646.18 --> 647.26]  I wanted to go to that card.
[647.34 --> 648.96]  It's one that I've visited a hundred times.
[649.72 --> 652.70]  And I typed it in and nothing.
[653.66 --> 656.66]  Then, I was like, does this just not even work anymore at all?
[657.08 --> 658.94]  And then I typed in perpetual.
[659.62 --> 662.02]  Which, I think you probably know what doc I was looking for.
[662.12 --> 662.22]  Oh, yeah.
[662.22 --> 662.50]  Yeah.
[662.90 --> 666.80]  So, perpetual is what we use for finding the WAN show document.
[666.80 --> 669.90]  The perpetual WAN show live stream document.
[670.02 --> 672.28]  It's one that I promise you.
[672.64 --> 677.04]  I promise I have accessed at some point or another on every computer I own.
[677.18 --> 682.56]  Because either, you know, I'm reviewing topics for the next week or I'm using it.
[682.56 --> 683.32]  Streaming from a weird location.
[683.72 --> 683.86]  Yeah.
[683.98 --> 684.14]  Yeah.
[684.26 --> 686.22]  I definitely have accessed it.
[686.74 --> 688.94]  And it didn't come up.
[689.50 --> 693.80]  And I was just like, this is flipping unbelievable.
[693.80 --> 695.90]  It used to be so consistent.
[696.34 --> 699.12]  Google products in general right now actually seem like they're genuinely getting worse.
[699.38 --> 702.10]  Not like they're just getting older and certain other products are improving.
[702.24 --> 705.22]  Like, they actually feel like they're declining in value and quality.
[705.86 --> 709.82]  And they're just shutting down things that they have.
[710.16 --> 714.84]  Like, recently, their URL shortener got rid of officially.
[714.84 --> 718.42]  I think for a long time now you haven't been able to create new shortened URLs.
[718.64 --> 722.34]  But I think the old shortened URLs are also just non-working.
[722.58 --> 722.84]  Yeah.
[723.06 --> 728.40]  So, like, they keep shutting things down and making what they have actively worse.
[729.44 --> 729.92]  Dude.
[730.64 --> 731.78]  Can you, can someone.
[731.88 --> 732.26]  Rough time to be at Google.
[732.50 --> 732.70]  Okay.
[734.42 --> 735.32]  Out yourself.
[736.44 --> 738.70]  Is anyone from Google watching right now?
[739.24 --> 739.48]  Yeah.
[739.48 --> 745.86]  Can you explain to me, please, in simple English so that I, a blonde, can understand.
[746.68 --> 747.48]  Almost got him.
[751.06 --> 760.58]  Can you explain to me why it is that when I go to docs.google.com, it is so flipping hard
[760.58 --> 765.48]  to find a doc that someone just shared with me compared to if I go to drive.google.com.
[767.16 --> 767.60]  Why?
[767.60 --> 773.66]  Why is that, why is it the interface so obtuse?
[775.82 --> 776.74]  Guys, let me know.
[777.14 --> 778.18]  If you, if you disagree.
[778.34 --> 778.72]  Porto.
[778.84 --> 779.76]  Yeah, it's so bad.
[779.98 --> 782.46]  It's so bad.
[783.08 --> 786.80]  But, like, even, even the search in drive.google.com is garbage.
[787.60 --> 788.80]  Well, yeah, sure.
[788.98 --> 794.36]  But that's, that's a completely separate level of, like, it's a, it's a different level of
[794.36 --> 794.72]  garbage.
[794.98 --> 795.12]  Yeah.
[795.12 --> 802.14]  The fact that someone can share me on a doc, and I literally cannot find it in docs.google.com
[802.14 --> 806.52]  drives me in, just, batty.
[806.52 --> 810.32]  I don't know how to deal with how angry it makes me.
[810.90 --> 813.60]  I don't want to make our company leave Google Workspace.
[814.16 --> 816.80]  Because there's things about being in Google Workspace that I like a lot.
[816.86 --> 818.50]  Like, I really like Google Calendar, for example.
[818.50 --> 827.66]  But drive search might be one of the things that, like, nail in the coffins are our workspace
[827.66 --> 828.52]  license.
[829.80 --> 835.30]  Because it's actually so bad that it's starting to, to noticeably negatively impact people's
[835.30 --> 836.34]  ability to do their job.
[836.34 --> 839.52]  Which is wild.
[842.36 --> 842.80]  Yeah.
[843.02 --> 845.48]  And, and it's, it's just, it's stupid stuff.
[845.90 --> 847.44]  Like, here, check this out.
[847.72 --> 848.00]  Okay?
[848.92 --> 851.26]  Why is the interface different?
[851.78 --> 855.64]  When I'm in docs, what, what is this?
[855.96 --> 857.14]  This is this.
[857.86 --> 859.14]  That's what this is.
[859.56 --> 860.42]  Not this.
[860.42 --> 864.68]  This is where I would go for, you know, sheets or whatever.
[865.04 --> 865.30]  See?
[865.54 --> 865.96]  See, look.
[866.52 --> 866.92]  This!
[867.28 --> 869.64]  This is what the drive interface looks like.
[870.30 --> 870.78]  Why?
[872.78 --> 873.40]  Don't worry.
[873.48 --> 874.94]  This is just the, the WAN show account.
[875.02 --> 875.36]  There's nothing.
[875.54 --> 875.80]  Okay.
[875.94 --> 876.36]  Just chill.
[876.76 --> 877.10]  All right.
[878.96 --> 882.76]  Why, why, why, why is this, why is this set up like this?
[883.24 --> 884.48]  I don't get it.
[885.06 --> 886.82]  They should be the same, obviously.
[888.52 --> 889.48]  East Coast Sunrise.
[889.48 --> 890.92]  That interface hasn't been touched in a decade.
[891.02 --> 891.82]  Well, one of them has.
[892.66 --> 894.74]  They should be the same, obviously.
[897.02 --> 899.72]  Is it a problem with the file organization or naming schemes?
[900.08 --> 905.54]  No, because, I mean, look, the thing is that a lot of the time, you know, a cloud drive
[905.54 --> 909.82]  is not particularly organized because you might not be the only person who has access
[909.82 --> 910.28]  to it.
[910.66 --> 915.60]  So even if you have the best of intentions for keeping everything perfectly laid out and
[915.60 --> 918.34]  perfectly organized, it doesn't always work out that way because people are going
[918.34 --> 921.78]  to be sharing you on drives, that sharing you on individual documents, sharing you on
[921.78 --> 923.08]  the document, then sharing you on the drive.
[923.40 --> 925.46]  And you don't always have control over that.
[925.46 --> 930.58]  So making the interface intuitive is super important.
[930.68 --> 935.58]  Making it easy to find a recent document is super, super important.
[935.58 --> 941.12]  I have this persistent problem where whenever we do quarterly reviews internally, I try to
[941.12 --> 945.90]  find the folder that I'm supposed to dump quarterly reviews into.
[945.90 --> 952.60]  Um, but if I search quarterly review, despite one of the folders in the tree being called
[952.60 --> 954.90]  quarterly review, it will not come up.
[954.96 --> 958.20]  I can go through every single result that comes up through the search.
[958.28 --> 959.48]  I can skip through the pages, do everything.
[959.60 --> 963.14]  It will not come up despite the folder being called that in drive.
[963.46 --> 964.66]  You'd think it would come up.
[964.72 --> 965.30]  It will not.
[965.30 --> 971.82]  So the, the, I had to get the person who shared me on that folder to send me the direct link.
[971.92 --> 977.58]  And then I like start it in Google drive so that I can find it in the stars because it
[977.58 --> 979.56]  is genuinely unsearchable for me.
[979.62 --> 984.40]  If I try to search for the tree that it's in, then it's a problem because someone else
[984.40 --> 985.50]  made this folder structure.
[985.66 --> 991.30]  So they used, um, as an example, uh, I'll use something that is, is slightly different,
[991.30 --> 994.34]  but as an example, they used a folder called infrastructure.
[994.34 --> 997.56]  It's like, how many, how many times do you think a folder named infrastructure has been
[997.56 --> 998.28]  shared with me?
[998.94 --> 999.56]  A lot.
[999.66 --> 1002.88]  And then when I search for it, there's like 40 of them.
[1002.94 --> 1004.68]  I'm like, I don't know which one is the right one.
[1004.72 --> 1006.36]  So I always have to go back to this.
[1006.44 --> 1010.94]  It's like, man, how can it not find quarterly review?
[1012.02 --> 1013.42]  Like the, I, I, sure.
[1013.44 --> 1017.40]  I'm going to have a bunch of documents called quarterly review, but let me sort by documents
[1017.40 --> 1017.88]  and folders.
[1017.88 --> 1021.16]  Then I'll find it instantly, but no, it just doesn't work.
[1022.60 --> 1023.00]  Why?
[1023.26 --> 1024.10]  Oh man.
[1025.34 --> 1028.88]  I could have found that with like file explorer and windows XP.
[1029.44 --> 1030.40]  This is ridiculous.
[1030.82 --> 1035.24]  Well, you know, I was actually, I actually have this in the video concepts bin right now.
[1035.90 --> 1038.34]  Was windows XP as good as we remember it being?
[1038.52 --> 1038.90]  No problem.
[1039.02 --> 1043.24]  I want to, I want to make that video because I feel like there's these nostalgia glasses
[1043.24 --> 1044.02]  for windows XP.
[1044.10 --> 1045.82]  Windows XP search was kind of a piece of garbage.
[1046.06 --> 1046.42]  Probably.
[1046.56 --> 1047.54]  It was not very good.
[1047.56 --> 1048.62]  Could you index back then?
[1048.82 --> 1052.78]  Uh, no, you could, but it took forever.
[1052.78 --> 1056.56]  Part of which was because we were all on mechanical storage at the time, but it took forever.
[1056.80 --> 1058.78]  And it, it, it, it was not perfect.
[1059.00 --> 1061.28]  I'm pretty sure I ran indexing back in the day.
[1061.30 --> 1061.50]  Oh yeah.
[1061.70 --> 1061.86]  Yeah.
[1062.04 --> 1062.18]  Yeah.
[1062.26 --> 1062.60]  You run it.
[1062.66 --> 1063.12]  It wasn't.
[1063.22 --> 1064.80]  But I also like enjoyed doing things like that.
[1064.84 --> 1066.26]  Like defragging was so cool.
[1066.26 --> 1068.68]  Watching the little animations and stuff.
[1068.80 --> 1068.90]  Yeah.
[1068.90 --> 1069.02]  Yeah.
[1069.02 --> 1069.14]  Yeah.
[1069.14 --> 1069.34]  Yeah.
[1069.34 --> 1069.50]  Yeah.
[1069.50 --> 1072.98]  I saw something the other day that I thought would be interesting to do a video on, but
[1072.98 --> 1077.10]  I was, I was the reason why I haven't brought up with you or, or James is because I haven't
[1077.10 --> 1080.60]  thought of a title that makes it worthy of people clicking on it.
[1080.60 --> 1082.96]  But what the heck were briefcases?
[1082.96 --> 1084.28]  Oh yeah.
[1084.28 --> 1087.48]  I saw this, this, uh, this popped up for me recently as well.
[1087.54 --> 1088.64]  I saw a short or something like that.
[1088.64 --> 1089.64]  Someone's like, no one ever used these properly.
[1089.68 --> 1093.24]  And I remember like, no, this was for like moving things or something.
[1093.32 --> 1093.50]  Yeah.
[1093.50 --> 1096.34]  It was, it was, um, it was for like your floppy disk.
[1096.56 --> 1099.78]  So it would automatically sync to your floppy disk or something like that.
[1099.82 --> 1099.98]  Yeah.
[1100.04 --> 1102.60]  It had some form of automatic syncing functionality.
[1102.94 --> 1103.04]  Yeah.
[1103.10 --> 1104.02]  It was something like that.
[1104.06 --> 1108.00]  I had never once used it and I didn't really understand what they were for.
[1108.00 --> 1112.94]  I looked it up at some point and it was essentially like sync toy or something like that.
[1112.96 --> 1113.64]  Which is cool actually.
[1113.64 --> 1119.02]  Which is pretty cool, but the functionality was extremely limited if I recall correctly.
[1119.40 --> 1119.54]  Yeah.
[1120.82 --> 1124.12]  So if you had an external hard drive, it kept your, apparently it could also be used for
[1124.12 --> 1125.86]  like photo backup and stuff like that later.
[1126.00 --> 1126.94]  Auto sync with zip drive.
[1127.02 --> 1127.16]  Yeah.
[1127.24 --> 1127.46]  Okay.
[1127.58 --> 1127.90]  There you go.
[1127.92 --> 1130.96]  It seems cool, but it's just really weird.
[1131.12 --> 1132.86]  Witty Willis says it was clunky at best.
[1132.96 --> 1133.60]  I hated it.
[1133.66 --> 1133.84]  Yeah.
[1134.14 --> 1134.46]  Yeah.
[1134.46 --> 1140.26]  The fact that that was one of the like first options you had for like a right click contextual
[1140.26 --> 1146.14]  menu was always baffling to me as a someone who didn't work when operating systems that
[1146.14 --> 1148.80]  had that feature were, were a thing.
[1148.92 --> 1151.16]  I was like, what could this possibly be for?
[1152.12 --> 1156.02]  One thing to remember too, but like the, like was windows XP bad thing when I compared
[1156.02 --> 1160.36]  the search, like if we want to go for windows seven, even that's from 2009, dude.
[1161.20 --> 1163.08]  I hate how long ago 2009 was.
[1163.08 --> 1167.84]  And like the search on windows seven for finding files was actually fine.
[1167.96 --> 1168.34]  Yeah, it was fine.
[1168.70 --> 1174.44]  So we don't have to go as far back as XP, but we can go back to the point when I was
[1174.44 --> 1175.04]  in high school.
[1175.24 --> 1179.74]  At this point, I think that Microsoft engineers are just memeing on windows search.
[1180.22 --> 1180.62]  Okay.
[1180.62 --> 1182.58]  So I agree, but we're currently talking about Google search.
[1182.64 --> 1184.24]  Like I searched for actually worse.
[1184.42 --> 1184.64]  Yeah.
[1184.76 --> 1186.28]  No, no, really.
[1186.48 --> 1187.60]  Nothing is worse than Microsoft.
[1187.60 --> 1192.28]  I searched for an application I had installed and it literally opened up a webpage.
[1192.28 --> 1194.00]  Like I searched for...
[1194.00 --> 1194.86]  Did you just press enter right away?
[1194.96 --> 1196.90]  I searched word for word.
[1197.82 --> 1199.04]  Like character for character.
[1199.04 --> 1201.22]  I searched word for word in Google drive and it doesn't even find it at all.
[1201.30 --> 1202.42]  Character for character.
[1202.62 --> 1203.42]  It's gone as far as I can.
[1203.42 --> 1208.10]  I typed in an application I had installed and I pressed enter and it opened up a web search.
[1208.30 --> 1208.74]  No, no.
[1209.14 --> 1211.92]  Google is not there yet.
[1212.68 --> 1213.56]  I don't know, dude.
[1213.68 --> 1216.58]  If you press enter too fast, it'll just find a completely different...
[1216.58 --> 1217.56]  It'll open a new window.
[1217.70 --> 1218.80]  No, I just won't find it at all.
[1218.88 --> 1220.12]  Well, I don't know.
[1220.12 --> 1222.98]  Let's agree that they're both terrible.
[1223.12 --> 1223.28]  Yeah.
[1223.48 --> 1223.84]  Nice.
[1228.40 --> 1230.64]  What are we supposed to be talking about right now, Dan?
[1230.72 --> 1233.24]  Can you get this thing back on the tracks here?
[1233.26 --> 1233.62]  Topic two.
[1233.78 --> 1234.52]  Topic two.
[1235.16 --> 1235.50]  Okay.
[1235.66 --> 1236.90]  Luke, what do you want to talk about?
[1237.06 --> 1238.40]  Oh, yeah.
[1238.78 --> 1240.78]  Oh, this is where I got my wires crossed.
[1240.92 --> 1245.42]  This is what the FTC is actually conducting an investigation into.
[1245.60 --> 1246.50]  FTC won't let me be.
[1246.50 --> 1251.42]  The FTC is conducting an investigation into surveillance pricing.
[1251.56 --> 1251.74]  Yeah.
[1251.74 --> 1252.80]  That's an interesting name for it.
[1252.84 --> 1254.52]  Dude, this is freaking terrible.
[1254.94 --> 1255.30]  Everything.
[1255.52 --> 1257.10]  Why is the news always bad?
[1257.94 --> 1258.62]  You know what?
[1258.84 --> 1259.22]  No.
[1260.14 --> 1260.56]  No.
[1261.86 --> 1262.94]  Next WAN show.
[1263.84 --> 1265.16]  I'm doing it right now.
[1265.50 --> 1269.50]  I'm tasking the team to have an all good news WAN show.
[1269.64 --> 1270.64]  Only good news WAN show.
[1270.68 --> 1271.38]  Next week, only good news.
[1271.38 --> 1272.70]  There isn't going to be enough news.
[1273.12 --> 1274.54]  20 minute WAN show.
[1274.58 --> 1275.18]  Let's go.
[1275.18 --> 1276.10]  No, no.
[1276.50 --> 1279.24]  We'll have to make the news if there isn't enough news.
[1279.32 --> 1281.12]  Positive sentiment does not sell.
[1281.50 --> 1283.82]  All good news on WAN show.
[1283.94 --> 1284.96]  Only good news WAN show.
[1284.98 --> 1285.52]  Let's go.
[1285.90 --> 1286.14]  Okay.
[1286.74 --> 1287.10]  There.
[1287.26 --> 1287.70]  It's done.
[1287.84 --> 1288.06]  All right.
[1288.06 --> 1304.20]  FTC is conducting an investigation into surveillance pricing, aka individualized surge pricing, where an algorithm leverages data on a single user's demographics and past behavior to quickly change the prices offered to them and potentially offer some people far higher prices for the same product.
[1304.20 --> 1308.66]  While this is a known tactic in the gaming industry.
[1308.66 --> 1309.38]  Surprise, surprise.
[1309.76 --> 1313.88]  It's unclear to what extent this practice is being used by other industries.
[1313.88 --> 1330.04]  The commission announced that it would be ordering eight companies, including MasterCard and JPMorgan Chase, that offer products and services that enable businesses to engage in surveillance pricing to turn over information about the impact these pricing schemes have on privacy, competition and consumer protection.
[1330.04 --> 1332.04]  Rough.
[1332.04 --> 1334.46]  rough
[1334.46 --> 1337.50]  dude like
[1337.50 --> 1339.88]  I don't even know
[1339.88 --> 1340.94]  where to begin
[1340.94 --> 1344.00]  to talk about how not okay this is
[1344.00 --> 1345.40]  yeah
[1345.40 --> 1347.38]  like it's
[1347.38 --> 1349.36]  it's one thing
[1349.36 --> 1351.82]  it's one thing okay
[1351.82 --> 1353.40]  if you're walking around
[1353.40 --> 1355.50]  a Walmart or something like that
[1355.50 --> 1357.14]  and I'm not saying Walmart is doing this
[1357.14 --> 1359.60]  in fact I think they specifically claim they're not doing it
[1359.60 --> 1360.72]  but who knows
[1360.72 --> 1363.40]  but it's one thing if you're walking around
[1363.40 --> 1365.34]  in Walmart and they
[1365.34 --> 1367.46]  realize that like all of a sudden
[1367.46 --> 1368.74]  there's a run on toilet paper
[1368.74 --> 1370.18]  pun intended
[1370.18 --> 1379.00]  I think we grinned so much it hurt my face
[1379.00 --> 1381.22]  that's a long story don't worry about it
[1381.22 --> 1381.52]  yeah
[1381.52 --> 1385.58]  so there's a run on toilet paper
[1385.58 --> 1387.54]  and they kind of go okay surge pricing
[1387.54 --> 1389.28]  and they've got
[1389.28 --> 1392.08]  they've got these like remotely configurable price tags
[1392.08 --> 1393.78]  and they can like configure the price
[1393.78 --> 1395.90]  it is an entirely
[1395.90 --> 1397.34]  different thing
[1397.34 --> 1398.82]  if you're on your phone
[1398.82 --> 1400.02]  looking up
[1400.02 --> 1401.24]  diarrhea treatments
[1401.24 --> 1403.66]  and then as you are
[1403.66 --> 1404.50]  in the store
[1404.50 --> 1406.18]  and as you approach
[1406.18 --> 1407.60]  you the individual
[1407.60 --> 1408.68]  approach
[1408.68 --> 1409.48]  the
[1409.48 --> 1410.50]  the shelf
[1410.50 --> 1411.88]  the price like
[1411.88 --> 1413.56]  ticks up before you can get there
[1413.56 --> 1415.36]  they're like oh he has this now
[1415.36 --> 1417.40]  because you absolutely need it
[1417.40 --> 1418.38]  they're not stocking up
[1418.38 --> 1419.96]  this is a reactive purchase
[1419.96 --> 1421.32]  let's charge more
[1421.32 --> 1421.86]  uh-huh
[1421.86 --> 1422.82]  they're gonna buy it
[1422.82 --> 1424.60]  they're not gonna risk driving somewhere else
[1424.60 --> 1425.70]  yeah like this is
[1425.70 --> 1428.28]  okay so let's let's use a more real world example
[1428.28 --> 1429.90]  okay less hypothetical
[1429.90 --> 1431.08]  okay Uber right
[1431.08 --> 1432.20]  they've got surge pricing
[1432.20 --> 1433.60]  during times of high demand
[1433.60 --> 1435.40]  and low supply supposedly
[1435.40 --> 1437.76]  uh where prices prices go up
[1437.76 --> 1439.22]  during peak travel hours
[1439.22 --> 1440.10]  okay
[1440.10 --> 1442.12]  what if instead of it going up
[1442.12 --> 1442.48]  because
[1442.48 --> 1443.90]  generally speaking
[1443.90 --> 1445.50]  a lot of people are using the service
[1445.50 --> 1447.16]  what if it goes up
[1447.16 --> 1447.76]  because
[1447.76 --> 1450.22]  you get a text from someone
[1450.22 --> 1451.68]  about a personal emergency
[1451.68 --> 1452.98]  and
[1452.98 --> 1454.44]  you are talking to them
[1454.44 --> 1455.24]  and you don't have
[1455.24 --> 1455.94]  your car
[1455.94 --> 1457.50]  and Uber goes
[1457.50 --> 1458.26]  hmm
[1458.26 --> 1459.66]  interesting
[1459.66 --> 1461.38]  and doubles your price
[1461.38 --> 1463.22]  now
[1463.22 --> 1464.04]  that again
[1464.04 --> 1465.34]  actually is maybe a little bit
[1465.34 --> 1465.90]  far-fetched
[1465.90 --> 1466.90]  on the other side
[1466.90 --> 1469.00]  because they would have to be tapped into
[1469.00 --> 1469.70]  you know whatever
[1469.70 --> 1470.80]  comms you're using
[1470.80 --> 1473.84]  and they would have to be able to put all that contextual data together
[1473.84 --> 1474.08]  but
[1474.08 --> 1476.98]  I don't think that that is necessarily
[1476.98 --> 1480.58]  a completely impossible outcome
[1480.58 --> 1481.42]  I
[1481.42 --> 1481.64]  there
[1481.64 --> 1482.26]  so there's
[1482.26 --> 1484.38]  we've probably talked about this on WAN show before
[1484.38 --> 1485.16]  but in Finland
[1485.16 --> 1487.98]  there's speeding tickets that are based on the offender's income
[1487.98 --> 1489.64]  which are based
[1489.64 --> 1490.78]  in general by the way
[1490.78 --> 1491.20]  and I've always thought that was cool
[1491.20 --> 1492.78]  this is not cool
[1492.78 --> 1494.16]  this is not the same thing
[1494.16 --> 1495.08]  this is rough
[1495.08 --> 1497.98]  and this doesn't feel like it's going to be designed to
[1497.98 --> 1500.38]  like prey on the wealthy
[1500.38 --> 1502.94]  this feels like it's going to be designed to prey on the vulnerable
[1502.94 --> 1506.18]  like almost guaranteed
[1506.18 --> 1507.98]  so that's
[1507.98 --> 1508.90]  that's rough
[1508.90 --> 1510.66]  Lion King's IT guy says
[1510.66 --> 1513.48]  yeah Linus is literally talking about bereavement flight rates
[1513.48 --> 1515.70]  except instead of giving a discount
[1515.70 --> 1517.68]  they could just take advantage of you
[1517.68 --> 1518.70]  and because
[1518.70 --> 1520.58]  it's so difficult
[1520.58 --> 1522.38]  for a third party
[1522.38 --> 1523.14]  to come in
[1523.14 --> 1524.86]  and investigate this practice
[1524.86 --> 1526.06]  without a whistleblower
[1526.06 --> 1527.16]  pretty much
[1527.16 --> 1529.20]  delivering the algorithm
[1529.20 --> 1530.50]  or the code
[1530.50 --> 1531.78]  to investigators
[1531.78 --> 1534.42]  because you can't observe it from the outside
[1534.42 --> 1534.74]  right
[1534.74 --> 1536.16]  every individual
[1536.16 --> 1538.42]  just gets their individual pricing
[1538.42 --> 1539.70]  and the individual
[1539.70 --> 1543.10]  manipulation from the service
[1543.10 --> 1544.84]  it's really
[1544.84 --> 1546.62]  really hard
[1546.62 --> 1549.04]  to figure out exactly what's going on
[1549.04 --> 1552.70]  yeah
[1552.70 --> 1558.60]  someone posted in Flowplane chat
[1558.60 --> 1561.10]  that I lost it
[1561.10 --> 1561.76]  but that we're like
[1561.76 --> 1563.38]  acting like this doesn't already happen
[1563.38 --> 1565.58]  maybe there's a miscommunication
[1565.58 --> 1566.28]  no this is
[1566.28 --> 1567.40]  this is being investigated
[1567.40 --> 1568.86]  this absolutely does already happen
[1568.86 --> 1569.12]  yeah
[1569.12 --> 1570.64]  yeah
[1570.64 --> 1572.22]  the
[1572.22 --> 1575.08]  Flowplane chat's got some examples though
[1575.08 --> 1576.28]  TC and DC says
[1576.28 --> 1577.98]  Uber could notice that you
[1577.98 --> 1579.38]  get in your car every day
[1579.38 --> 1580.72]  from a swanky office building
[1580.72 --> 1584.00]  that address could go up over time
[1584.00 --> 1587.94]  that is actually a great example
[1587.94 --> 1590.12]  Techie93 says
[1590.12 --> 1591.30]  if they know you're getting a call
[1591.30 --> 1592.40]  from someone at a hospital
[1592.40 --> 1596.24]  all they have to see is
[1596.24 --> 1597.80]  man that's crazy
[1597.80 --> 1598.50]  I think well okay
[1598.50 --> 1599.64]  I think that's already built into
[1599.64 --> 1600.94]  standard surge pricing stuff
[1600.94 --> 1602.66]  I understand it's not necessarily a surge
[1602.66 --> 1603.82]  but I think they already have that going
[1603.82 --> 1604.94]  like location based pricing
[1604.94 --> 1607.10]  I think that's existed for a long time
[1607.10 --> 1608.32]  what they're currently talking about
[1608.32 --> 1609.60]  is more individual based
[1609.60 --> 1611.42]  your habits
[1611.42 --> 1612.38]  things like that
[1612.38 --> 1613.42]  not necessarily like
[1613.42 --> 1614.30]  yeah they could notice
[1614.30 --> 1614.76]  sorry
[1614.76 --> 1615.22]  sorry
[1615.22 --> 1615.50]  sorry
[1615.50 --> 1615.72]  sorry
[1615.72 --> 1617.18]  I miscommunicated that
[1617.18 --> 1619.00]  so they notice you getting in
[1619.00 --> 1619.96]  from a swanky hotel
[1619.96 --> 1620.80]  pretty frequently
[1620.80 --> 1621.94]  and then they just raise your prices
[1621.94 --> 1622.44]  in general
[1622.44 --> 1623.34]  yeah
[1623.34 --> 1623.72]  yeah
[1623.72 --> 1625.34]  I'm just saying that the hospital one
[1625.34 --> 1626.90]  that's been around for a long time
[1626.90 --> 1628.32]  or that type of thing
[1628.32 --> 1629.20]  has been around for a long time
[1629.20 --> 1630.46]  but that might not even be location
[1630.46 --> 1632.22]  because I could be
[1632.22 --> 1634.12]  I guess they can see my destination
[1634.12 --> 1634.86]  but
[1634.86 --> 1638.68]  like they might be able to tell
[1638.68 --> 1640.10]  like okay you went to the hospital
[1640.10 --> 1640.36]  yeah
[1640.36 --> 1642.50]  and you go to the hospital
[1642.50 --> 1643.14]  every once in a while
[1643.14 --> 1644.16]  but this time you immediately
[1644.16 --> 1645.04]  called another Uber
[1645.04 --> 1645.94]  to like a store
[1645.94 --> 1647.98]  so like you forgot something
[1647.98 --> 1649.28]  it seems like
[1649.28 --> 1650.20]  and they're like
[1650.20 --> 1650.68]  oh okay
[1650.68 --> 1651.54]  time to charge them more
[1651.54 --> 1653.28]  this is brutal man
[1653.28 --> 1654.52]  I hate this
[1654.52 --> 1655.86]  so much
[1655.86 --> 1658.50]  like I actually
[1658.50 --> 1660.00]  I actually hate this
[1660.00 --> 1663.20]  yeah
[1663.20 --> 1664.36]  surveillance pricing
[1664.36 --> 1665.30]  it's rough
[1665.30 --> 1666.30]  I'm sorry guys
[1666.30 --> 1669.58]  in other good news
[1669.58 --> 1670.22]  or not
[1670.22 --> 1671.48]  this week
[1671.48 --> 1672.28]  yet another YouTuber
[1672.28 --> 1672.88]  was threatened
[1672.88 --> 1673.90]  by yet another company
[1673.90 --> 1674.84]  called DCS
[1674.84 --> 1675.26]  again
[1675.26 --> 1676.20]  it's a different company
[1676.20 --> 1676.74]  but still
[1676.74 --> 1678.34]  this time it was
[1678.34 --> 1679.56]  Stefan Fisher
[1679.56 --> 1680.92]  of all
[1680.92 --> 1681.76]  off-road
[1681.76 --> 1682.98]  4x4 adventures
[1682.98 --> 1684.06]  who reviewed
[1684.06 --> 1685.34]  LFP batteries
[1685.34 --> 1686.14]  manufactured by
[1686.14 --> 1687.20]  Deep Cycle Systems
[1687.20 --> 1688.44]  that's the DCS
[1688.44 --> 1690.98]  while Fisher's review
[1690.98 --> 1692.10]  was initially positive
[1692.10 --> 1693.20]  he later found
[1693.20 --> 1694.40]  that the battery's capacity
[1694.40 --> 1695.04]  degraded
[1695.04 --> 1696.18]  unexpectedly quickly
[1696.18 --> 1697.14]  over the course
[1697.14 --> 1698.52]  of the next few years
[1698.52 --> 1700.26]  Fisher heard similar reports
[1700.26 --> 1701.64]  from other off-roading enthusiasts
[1701.64 --> 1702.84]  so he tested the batteries
[1702.84 --> 1703.48]  and likewise
[1703.48 --> 1704.94]  had independent testers
[1704.94 --> 1705.98]  validate their results
[1705.98 --> 1707.64]  validate his results
[1707.64 --> 1707.90]  sorry
[1707.90 --> 1709.10]  these tests showed
[1709.10 --> 1710.68]  severe capacity loss
[1710.68 --> 1711.88]  Fisher likewise
[1711.88 --> 1713.56]  reported on DCS customers
[1713.56 --> 1714.16]  who alleged
[1714.16 --> 1715.82]  who alleged that
[1715.82 --> 1717.68]  DCS's RMA processing
[1717.68 --> 1718.88]  sorry
[1718.88 --> 1720.44]  RMA process testing
[1720.44 --> 1722.64]  consistently resulted
[1722.64 --> 1724.72]  in rosy capacity
[1724.72 --> 1725.40]  estimations
[1725.40 --> 1726.68]  leading to the company
[1726.68 --> 1728.68]  to refuse to
[1728.68 --> 1729.94]  replace faulty batteries
[1729.94 --> 1730.90]  DCS is now
[1730.90 --> 1731.64]  suing Fisher
[1731.64 --> 1732.48]  for defamation
[1732.48 --> 1733.12]  okay I'm gonna
[1733.12 --> 1734.10]  unword sell that
[1734.10 --> 1734.60]  a little bit
[1734.60 --> 1735.10]  yeah
[1735.10 --> 1735.74]  basically
[1735.74 --> 1736.62]  he found out
[1736.62 --> 1737.36]  some customers
[1737.36 --> 1738.66]  were having
[1738.66 --> 1739.76]  a negative experience
[1739.76 --> 1740.78]  with DCS's
[1740.78 --> 1741.84]  RMA process
[1741.84 --> 1743.58]  where DCS
[1743.58 --> 1744.80]  would get the batteries
[1744.80 --> 1746.18]  basically go
[1746.18 --> 1746.74]  oh no yeah
[1746.74 --> 1747.28]  we estimate
[1747.28 --> 1747.78]  that these
[1747.78 --> 1748.62]  still have
[1748.62 --> 1749.32]  good capacity
[1749.32 --> 1750.12]  and then
[1750.12 --> 1750.48]  they would
[1750.48 --> 1751.00]  refuse to
[1751.00 --> 1751.58]  replace them
[1751.58 --> 1752.36]  yeah
[1752.36 --> 1754.26]  according to
[1754.26 --> 1754.88]  Lewis Rossman
[1754.88 --> 1756.12]  DCS also
[1756.12 --> 1756.74]  retroactively
[1756.74 --> 1757.28]  changed its
[1757.28 --> 1757.92]  warranty on its
[1757.92 --> 1758.48]  website to
[1758.48 --> 1759.32]  reduce coverage
[1759.32 --> 1760.56]  without changing
[1760.56 --> 1761.50]  the last
[1761.50 --> 1762.42]  updated date
[1762.42 --> 1763.20]  rough
[1763.20 --> 1764.66]  which reads
[1764.66 --> 1765.64]  as June
[1765.64 --> 1766.54]  2021
[1766.54 --> 1767.66]  Rossman likewise
[1767.66 --> 1768.22]  says that
[1768.22 --> 1768.72]  the pages
[1768.72 --> 1769.56]  archiving
[1769.56 --> 1771.42]  this change
[1771.42 --> 1771.94]  appeared to
[1771.94 --> 1772.80]  have been removed
[1772.80 --> 1773.24]  from the
[1773.24 --> 1773.98]  Wayback Machine
[1773.98 --> 1774.86]  though they
[1774.86 --> 1775.50]  were available
[1775.50 --> 1776.30]  via other
[1776.30 --> 1777.02]  archiving services
[1777.02 --> 1777.30]  how do you
[1777.30 --> 1777.86]  remove something
[1777.86 --> 1778.24]  from the
[1778.24 --> 1779.00]  Wayback Machine
[1779.00 --> 1779.32]  I think you
[1779.32 --> 1780.24]  can request it
[1780.24 --> 1780.84]  but I'm surprised
[1780.84 --> 1781.48]  this one would
[1781.48 --> 1782.24]  have been approved
[1782.24 --> 1784.88]  in response to
[1784.88 --> 1785.56]  commenters who
[1785.56 --> 1786.08]  were concerned
[1786.08 --> 1786.86]  about the lawsuit
[1786.86 --> 1787.78]  DCS claimed
[1787.78 --> 1788.56]  via its Facebook
[1788.56 --> 1789.48]  page that it
[1789.48 --> 1790.16]  does not sue
[1790.16 --> 1790.96]  reviewers over
[1790.96 --> 1791.74]  product reviews
[1791.74 --> 1792.86]  when Fisher's
[1792.86 --> 1793.56]  lawyers sent a
[1793.56 --> 1794.10]  complaint to
[1794.10 --> 1794.96]  DCS's lawyers
[1794.96 --> 1795.92]  the language was
[1795.92 --> 1796.62]  slightly altered
[1796.62 --> 1797.30]  to claim that
[1797.30 --> 1798.28]  they don't sue
[1798.28 --> 1800.70]  over reviews
[1800.70 --> 1801.46]  that they view
[1801.46 --> 1802.14]  as genuine
[1802.14 --> 1803.86]  okay
[1803.86 --> 1807.16]  wow
[1807.16 --> 1812.14]  where's the
[1812.14 --> 1812.48]  good news
[1812.48 --> 1813.00]  oh right
[1813.00 --> 1813.54]  that's next
[1813.54 --> 1814.04]  week right
[1814.04 --> 1815.26]  because none
[1815.26 --> 1815.68]  of this is
[1815.68 --> 1816.16]  good news
[1816.16 --> 1816.92]  do we have
[1816.92 --> 1817.18]  any
[1817.18 --> 1819.38]  so basically
[1819.38 --> 1821.40]  I don't know
[1821.40 --> 1822.22]  anything about
[1822.22 --> 1822.78]  deep cycle
[1822.78 --> 1823.34]  systems
[1823.34 --> 1823.80]  batteries
[1823.80 --> 1824.58]  I don't know
[1824.58 --> 1825.06]  anything about
[1825.06 --> 1825.56]  the company
[1825.56 --> 1826.32]  I'd never heard
[1826.32 --> 1826.84]  of them before
[1826.84 --> 1827.62]  this this is my
[1827.62 --> 1828.40]  first exposure
[1828.40 --> 1828.86]  to them
[1828.86 --> 1829.90]  but what I
[1829.90 --> 1830.92]  can say for
[1830.92 --> 1832.00]  sure based on
[1832.00 --> 1832.38]  this first
[1832.38 --> 1833.32]  exposure is that
[1833.32 --> 1834.02]  they are
[1834.02 --> 1834.96]  they're a**holes
[1834.96 --> 1836.94]  so if you were
[1836.94 --> 1838.02]  considering anything
[1838.02 --> 1838.82]  from deep cycle
[1838.82 --> 1840.12]  systems then you
[1840.12 --> 1840.84]  should probably
[1840.84 --> 1841.72]  contact them
[1841.72 --> 1842.62]  let them know
[1842.62 --> 1843.52]  you were considering
[1843.52 --> 1844.14]  their product
[1844.14 --> 1844.88]  and that you found
[1844.88 --> 1845.46]  out about this
[1845.46 --> 1845.96]  and you're not
[1845.96 --> 1846.66]  considering it
[1846.66 --> 1846.96]  anymore
[1846.96 --> 1848.44]  um
[1848.44 --> 1850.30]  what do you
[1850.30 --> 1850.78]  will it says
[1850.78 --> 1851.22]  good news
[1851.22 --> 1851.70]  scrapper wars
[1851.70 --> 1852.40]  is amazing so
[1852.40 --> 1852.66]  far
[1852.66 --> 1853.46]  hey glad to hear
[1853.46 --> 1854.44]  that let's go
[1854.44 --> 1855.12]  bad news
[1855.12 --> 1856.04]  uh part two
[1856.04 --> 1857.22]  is not coming
[1857.22 --> 1857.96]  on the original
[1857.96 --> 1858.72]  schedule I
[1858.72 --> 1859.26]  reviewed the
[1859.26 --> 1859.92]  cut earlier
[1859.92 --> 1860.56]  this week
[1860.56 --> 1861.64]  and basically
[1861.64 --> 1863.98]  um maximum
[1863.98 --> 1865.26]  respect to the
[1865.26 --> 1866.02]  team I mean you
[1866.02 --> 1866.70]  guys you guys
[1866.70 --> 1867.90]  saw the the
[1867.90 --> 1868.82]  the spit
[1868.82 --> 1870.18]  polish mirror
[1870.18 --> 1870.92]  shine that

[1887.42 --> 1887.90]  to come out
[1887.90 --> 1889.00]  and that great
[1889.00 --> 1889.82]  plan is going
[1889.82 --> 1890.18]  to be later
[1890.18 --> 1891.34]  difficult thing
[1891.34 --> 1891.70]  to edit
[1891.70 --> 1892.80]  yep take
[1892.80 --> 1893.22]  some time

[1894.06 --> 1894.60]  ton of work
[1894.60 --> 1895.28]  and like I
[1895.28 --> 1896.14]  said absolutely
[1896.14 --> 1896.76]  no disrespect
[1896.76 --> 1897.30]  to the team
[1897.30 --> 1897.74]  that's working
[1897.74 --> 1898.08]  on it they
[1898.08 --> 1898.46]  just need a
[1898.46 --> 1898.82]  little bit more
[1898.82 --> 1899.34]  time so we're
[1899.34 --> 1899.58]  going to take

[1902.88 --> 1903.56]  we're we are
[1903.56 --> 1904.98]  hoping that it's

[1906.78 --> 1908.46]  week since you
[1908.46 --> 1909.22]  looked at me
[1909.22 --> 1910.58]  three roms in the
[1910.58 --> 1910.90]  year I said

[1911.46 --> 1912.40]  uh it's only
[1912.40 --> 1912.74]  gonna be an

[1916.34 --> 1917.64]  not uh I
[1917.64 --> 1917.88]  don't think
[1917.88 --> 1918.68]  absolutely not
[1918.68 --> 1919.56]  yeah no it's
[1919.56 --> 1920.16]  not it's not
[1920.16 --> 1921.14]  there uh we
[1921.14 --> 1923.64]  no no no
[1923.64 --> 1924.40]  also don't really
[1924.40 --> 1925.04]  think there's value
[1925.04 --> 1925.68]  there we'll we'll
[1925.68 --> 1926.06]  give you the
[1926.06 --> 1927.12]  product that that
[1927.12 --> 1927.84]  is good yeah
[1927.84 --> 1929.06]  and like you
[1929.06 --> 1929.68]  guys got you
[1929.68 --> 1930.30]  guys got your
[1930.30 --> 1931.14]  exclusives man
[1931.14 --> 1932.00]  we've had a ton
[1932.00 --> 1932.64]  of people signing
[1932.64 --> 1933.26]  up for float
[1933.26 --> 1933.68]  plane I think
[1933.68 --> 1934.26]  we've added over
[1934.26 --> 1935.30]  a thousand since
[1935.30 --> 1936.44]  scrapyard wars
[1936.44 --> 1937.42]  went up and
[1937.42 --> 1938.40]  they are definitely
[1938.40 --> 1939.18]  they're definitely
[1939.18 --> 1940.02]  getting some value
[1940.02 --> 1941.36]  the first extra
[1941.36 --> 1942.60]  is twice as long
[1942.60 --> 1943.20]  as the episode
[1943.20 --> 1944.62]  itself and people
[1944.62 --> 1946.18]  are flipping loving
[1946.18 --> 1947.42]  it and then there's
[1947.42 --> 1948.46]  an entire dedicated
[1948.46 --> 1950.70]  extra for uh
[1950.70 --> 1951.60]  Elijah's haircut
[1951.60 --> 1953.30]  which I haven't
[1953.30 --> 1954.06]  watched yet but I
[1954.06 --> 1954.98]  am so excited
[1954.98 --> 1956.08]  the fact that they
[1956.08 --> 1957.12]  captured his his
[1957.12 --> 1957.96]  wife's reaction
[1957.96 --> 1959.62]  oh yeah people like
[1959.62 --> 1961.38]  that um the fact
[1961.38 --> 1961.94]  that they captured
[1961.94 --> 1962.98]  his or the fact
[1962.98 --> 1963.86]  that Elijah captured
[1963.86 --> 1964.58]  his own wife's
[1964.58 --> 1965.24]  reaction at the end
[1965.24 --> 1965.82]  of the video is
[1965.82 --> 1966.94]  amazing yeah
[1966.94 --> 1968.28]  so good
[1968.28 --> 1971.78]  uh yeah yeah
[1971.78 --> 1972.94]  you know what I'm
[1972.94 --> 1974.32]  not gonna oh wow
[1974.32 --> 1975.14]  you guys really
[1975.14 --> 1976.30]  really can't see it
[1976.30 --> 1977.30]  oh well yep I'm
[1977.30 --> 1978.06]  not gonna I'm not
[1978.06 --> 1978.68]  gonna spoil it
[1978.68 --> 1980.14]  it's pretty good
[1980.14 --> 1981.56]  lmg.gg slash
[1981.56 --> 1982.24]  float plane
[1982.24 --> 1986.90]  um oh man
[1986.90 --> 1988.60]  he said he'd do
[1988.60 --> 1989.56]  something at 3k I
[1989.56 --> 1990.14]  think he did
[1990.14 --> 1991.38]  actually but it's
[1991.38 --> 1991.88]  not there yet
[1991.88 --> 1993.74]  oh what did he
[1993.74 --> 1994.16]  say he did
[1994.16 --> 1994.64]  I don't remember
[1994.64 --> 1996.26]  eyebrow slit I
[1996.26 --> 1996.50]  think
[1996.50 --> 1999.62]  what eyebrow slit
[1999.62 --> 2002.00]  oh what I think
[2002.00 --> 2002.48]  he said he would
[2002.48 --> 2003.54]  do that why if it
[2003.54 --> 2004.44]  did 3k I think
[2004.44 --> 2007.06]  oh uh okay it's
[2007.06 --> 2008.08]  not there yet oh
[2008.08 --> 2010.54]  okay I mean do we
[2010.54 --> 2011.48]  have anything in our
[2011.48 --> 2012.44]  in our on-camera
[2012.44 --> 2013.68]  personality contracts
[2013.68 --> 2014.44]  where people have to
[2014.44 --> 2015.02]  stay somewhat
[2015.02 --> 2015.60]  presentable
[2015.60 --> 2019.82]  like no it's a
[2019.82 --> 2021.52]  valid question it's
[2021.52 --> 2022.88]  a valid question I
[2022.88 --> 2024.54]  don't think so yeah
[2024.54 --> 2025.44]  because otherwise I'd
[2025.44 --> 2025.86]  be in trouble
[2025.86 --> 2030.82]  yikes oh man all
[2030.82 --> 2032.46]  right um are we
[2032.46 --> 2033.18]  still on topic too
[2033.18 --> 2033.98]  no I think we're
[2033.98 --> 2034.62]  supposed to probably
[2034.62 --> 2035.84]  do merch messages or
[2035.84 --> 2036.34]  something at some
[2036.34 --> 2037.64]  point yeah why do I
[2037.64 --> 2039.68]  do merch messages and
[2039.68 --> 2042.18]  yeah all right I'll
[2042.18 --> 2043.04]  explain what they are
[2043.04 --> 2043.76]  the way to interact
[2043.76 --> 2044.34]  with the show is
[2044.34 --> 2045.26]  merch message man what
[2045.26 --> 2046.32]  an awkward show so
[2046.32 --> 2048.04]  far today we are you
[2048.04 --> 2048.58]  know that's funny
[2048.58 --> 2049.80]  like last week I was
[2049.80 --> 2051.48]  like in my flow why
[2051.48 --> 2052.28]  did we end it early
[2052.28 --> 2053.38]  last week before I was
[2053.38 --> 2054.10]  meaning to ask you
[2054.10 --> 2054.78]  about this I was
[2054.78 --> 2056.30]  absolute garbage and
[2056.30 --> 2057.50]  then this week I just
[2057.50 --> 2058.94]  man I have no idea
[2058.94 --> 2060.24]  what's going on I have
[2060.24 --> 2060.84]  no idea what's going
[2060.84 --> 2062.66]  on uh no I don't know
[2062.66 --> 2063.42]  last week I was having
[2063.42 --> 2065.12]  fun and I wanted to
[2065.12 --> 2065.76]  leave him wanting more
[2065.76 --> 2067.60]  yeah fair enough it was
[2067.60 --> 2068.42]  uh yeah it was late
[2068.42 --> 2071.86]  that's fair um yeah
[2071.86 --> 2073.00]  merch messages so the
[2073.00 --> 2073.66]  way to interact with the
[2073.66 --> 2074.34]  show is send a merch
[2074.34 --> 2075.42]  message it'll go to
[2075.42 --> 2076.34]  producer Dan right I
[2076.34 --> 2077.02]  gotta explain how you do
[2077.02 --> 2078.32]  it uh that's producer you
[2078.32 --> 2078.78]  know we'll get to
[2078.78 --> 2079.80]  producer Dan later first
[2079.80 --> 2081.58]  you go to lttstore.com
[2081.58 --> 2082.90]  you add something to
[2082.90 --> 2083.80]  your cart and then in
[2083.80 --> 2084.94]  the checkout you'll see
[2084.94 --> 2085.70]  a little box where you
[2085.70 --> 2086.28]  can leave a merch
[2086.28 --> 2088.06]  message it'll pop up
[2088.06 --> 2089.30]  down here or it'll oh

[2093.52 --> 2094.62]  anonymous or you can
[2094.62 --> 2095.70]  leave your first name
[2095.70 --> 2097.04]  and last initial for a
[2097.04 --> 2097.84]  shout out hey there you

[2098.68 --> 2099.36]  something like that
[2099.36 --> 2101.58]  thing up there um it'll
[2101.58 --> 2102.66]  pop up like that or
[2102.66 --> 2103.70]  it'll go to producer Dan
[2103.70 --> 2105.08]  who will forward it to
[2105.08 --> 2105.98]  someone internally or
[2105.98 --> 2107.48]  reply to it himself or
[2107.48 --> 2109.40]  who will curate it for
[2109.40 --> 2111.56]  me or Luke to respond
[2111.56 --> 2112.52]  to so why don't we
[2112.52 --> 2113.16]  show them what a
[2113.16 --> 2114.36]  curated merch message
[2114.36 --> 2116.42]  looks like sure I got
[2116.42 --> 2117.32]  one here from Luke
[2117.32 --> 2118.58]  Linus is a blonde nerd
[2118.58 --> 2120.68]  you did not actually
[2120.68 --> 2123.70]  no no no no uh okay
[2123.70 --> 2126.20]  yeah sorry uh about a
[2126.20 --> 2127.98]  real one uh Linus what
[2127.98 --> 2129.00]  are your kids what were
[2129.00 --> 2130.04]  your kids reaction when
[2130.04 --> 2130.90]  they saw your new hair
[2130.90 --> 2132.12]  color oh my goodness I've
[2132.12 --> 2133.58]  been actually meaning to
[2133.58 --> 2134.96]  I saw one of them
[2134.96 --> 2138.30]  I've been there's
[2138.30 --> 2139.02]  easier ways to make
[2139.02 --> 2140.00]  your children cry
[2140.00 --> 2141.74]  Linus yeah I um I've
[2141.74 --> 2143.24]  been meaning to grab
[2143.24 --> 2144.14]  one of them from the
[2144.14 --> 2145.06]  security footage because
[2145.06 --> 2146.86]  it's really funny my my
[2146.86 --> 2149.78]  elder daughter goes I
[2149.78 --> 2150.56]  like your old hair
[2150.56 --> 2151.04]  better
[2151.04 --> 2156.58]  okay it's basically the
[2156.58 --> 2157.34]  same thing she said
[2157.34 --> 2158.18]  when I shaved the beard
[2158.18 --> 2159.34]  doesn't she ask you to
[2159.34 --> 2161.68]  like how long like how
[2161.68 --> 2162.76]  long until it goes back
[2162.76 --> 2163.72]  yeah yeah yeah she
[2163.72 --> 2164.36]  asked me if I'm gonna
[2164.36 --> 2166.32]  diet back I'm like like
[2166.32 --> 2167.04]  you know I don't know
[2167.04 --> 2167.74]  well how long do you
[2167.74 --> 2168.40]  have to keep it like
[2168.40 --> 2169.52]  that yeah yeah yeah
[2169.52 --> 2171.80]  yeah yeah so she's
[2171.80 --> 2173.36]  all not into it she's
[2173.36 --> 2175.10]  she's only uh around a
[2175.10 --> 2176.12]  decade and she's
[2176.12 --> 2177.26]  already got all kinds
[2177.26 --> 2178.44]  of thoughts on her dad's
[2178.44 --> 2179.42]  style so I guess we're
[2179.42 --> 2180.46]  headed into some pretty
[2180.46 --> 2181.80]  uh uncomfortable
[2181.80 --> 2183.30]  conversations as she
[2183.30 --> 2184.16]  makes it into her
[2184.16 --> 2185.00]  teenage years and
[2185.00 --> 2186.16]  figures out just how
[2186.16 --> 2186.78]  bad it is
[2186.78 --> 2191.50]  okay Linus what are
[2191.50 --> 2193.10]  your thoughts on career
[2193.10 --> 2194.88]  progression from an SI
[2194.88 --> 2195.86]  that does retail
[2195.86 --> 2197.20]  exclusively I assume
[2197.20 --> 2197.84]  that's a systems
[2197.84 --> 2199.70]  integrator so you work
[2199.70 --> 2201.92]  for a retail system
[2201.92 --> 2203.86]  integrator man it's
[2203.86 --> 2206.70]  tough because I I I
[2206.70 --> 2208.02]  don't really know I
[2208.02 --> 2208.54]  don't really know how
[2208.54 --> 2210.02]  to say this in a way
[2210.02 --> 2211.88]  that's not sort of mean
[2211.88 --> 2214.30]  but building computers is
[2214.30 --> 2217.10]  like not a super
[2217.10 --> 2218.62]  valuable career skill
[2218.62 --> 2221.02]  um I would say that
[2221.02 --> 2223.92]  fixing them is a way
[2223.92 --> 2225.28]  to potentially make
[2225.28 --> 2227.90]  more money but not at
[2227.90 --> 2230.02]  like uh not at a at a
[2230.02 --> 2232.04]  at a retail chain or
[2232.04 --> 2233.08]  anything like that like
[2233.08 --> 2234.02]  they're they're not going
[2234.02 --> 2235.90]  to pay you um anywhere
[2235.90 --> 2236.90]  near the rates that
[2236.90 --> 2237.36]  they're charging
[2237.36 --> 2239.60]  customers um and what it
[2239.60 --> 2241.18]  really boils down to is
[2241.18 --> 2242.08]  that if you want to
[2242.08 --> 2243.72]  escape that sort of wage
[2243.72 --> 2245.52]  ceiling in computer
[2245.52 --> 2247.48]  technician work the only
[2247.48 --> 2250.20]  way to do it is to set
[2250.20 --> 2252.44]  out on your own and and
[2252.44 --> 2253.82]  adopt an entrepreneurial
[2253.82 --> 2255.18]  spirit and try and tackle
[2255.18 --> 2256.12]  it that way but that is
[2256.12 --> 2258.54]  not going to be easy
[2258.54 --> 2262.40]  very hard um it's worded
[2262.40 --> 2264.40]  interestingly though uh
[2264.40 --> 2265.88]  exclusively does retail
[2265.88 --> 2267.36]  stuff or something like
[2267.36 --> 2268.50]  does this person own the
[2268.50 --> 2273.12]  SI um that I don't know
[2273.12 --> 2274.54]  I can't really tell I
[2274.54 --> 2275.96]  doubt it I I don't see
[2275.96 --> 2277.06]  how you'd survive as a
[2277.06 --> 2278.26]  computer store that just
[2278.26 --> 2280.00]  does nothing but put
[2280.00 --> 2280.92]  together new computers
[2280.92 --> 2284.18]  yeah um
[2284.18 --> 2285.62]  Corey is the name says
[2285.62 --> 2286.88]  sentiment system integrator
[2286.88 --> 2287.92]  makes putting standard
[2287.92 --> 2288.96]  components together sound
[2288.96 --> 2290.68]  way cooler than it is um
[2290.68 --> 2291.76]  nowhere near as challenging
[2291.76 --> 2293.62]  as it once was I do think
[2293.62 --> 2295.38]  that that also is a little
[2295.38 --> 2297.26]  dismissive I mean I think
[2297.26 --> 2299.18]  that a really good eye
[2299.18 --> 2300.52]  opener would be to check
[2300.52 --> 2301.60]  out our tour of Puget
[2301.60 --> 2302.74]  systems from a number of
[2302.74 --> 2305.00]  years back they show the
[2305.00 --> 2307.00]  kinds of processes and the
[2307.00 --> 2308.44]  kinds of tools that you
[2308.44 --> 2309.82]  need to develop in order to
[2309.82 --> 2312.38]  be a a well-oiled machine
[2312.38 --> 2313.42]  because it's more than just
[2313.42 --> 2314.58]  putting systems together you
[2314.58 --> 2315.36]  have to support those
[2315.36 --> 2316.56]  systems you have to ensure
[2316.56 --> 2316.94]  that
[2316.94 --> 2320.26]  excuse me sorry you have to
[2320.26 --> 2321.64]  ensure that they make it to
[2321.64 --> 2322.78]  their destination in one
[2322.78 --> 2324.94]  piece you have to have
[2324.94 --> 2327.86]  processes for um compatibility
[2327.86 --> 2330.54]  testing stability testing it
[2330.54 --> 2331.94]  you have to build relationships
[2331.94 --> 2333.20]  with vendors you have to
[2333.20 --> 2334.22]  manage your you have to
[2334.22 --> 2335.32]  manage your credit and cash
[2335.32 --> 2336.36]  flow like you're you're
[2336.36 --> 2338.38]  running a business right um
[2338.38 --> 2340.06]  it's not as simple as just
[2340.06 --> 2341.46]  buying computer parts and
[2341.46 --> 2342.34]  putting them together if it
[2342.34 --> 2343.68]  was everybody would do it
[2343.68 --> 2345.46]  and that's sort of the bottom
[2345.46 --> 2346.36]  line is you have to figure
[2346.36 --> 2348.28]  out what your personal value
[2348.28 --> 2351.12]  add is and try to extract as
[2351.12 --> 2353.06]  much of the money that you're
[2353.06 --> 2354.50]  generating as possible
[2354.50 --> 2356.70]  i some some people in full
[2356.70 --> 2357.56]  plane chat have said this but
[2357.56 --> 2358.92]  getting into some some level
[2358.92 --> 2361.08]  of enterprise it is probably
[2361.08 --> 2363.72]  the closest related work but
[2363.72 --> 2364.84]  it's not a hundred percent
[2364.84 --> 2366.48]  you'll need to you'll need to
[2366.48 --> 2366.78]  train
[2366.78 --> 2368.04]  um
[2368.04 --> 2370.64]  but yeah
[2370.64 --> 2372.32]  thanks luke
[2372.32 --> 2373.18]  yeah
[2373.18 --> 2376.84]  yeah give us one more dan
[2376.84 --> 2377.24]  sure
[2377.24 --> 2383.10]  let's see here have you heard
[2383.10 --> 2385.58]  dcs is suing an aussie youtuber
[2385.58 --> 2387.12]  we just read that one i missed
[2387.12 --> 2387.66]  that sorry
[2387.66 --> 2390.24]  hey linus i've been a long time
[2390.24 --> 2391.68]  viewer and finally pulled the
[2391.68 --> 2393.26]  trigger on the backpack i'm
[2393.26 --> 2395.38]  currently working a sales job as
[2395.38 --> 2397.16]  a college student and wondered if
[2397.16 --> 2398.16]  you had any tips from your
[2398.16 --> 2398.66]  experience
[2398.66 --> 2401.04]  oh man i mean the biggest thing
[2401.04 --> 2404.48]  for me was that i was selling
[2404.48 --> 2405.70]  something that i was really
[2405.70 --> 2406.48]  passionate about
[2406.48 --> 2409.40]  it's not really selling it's more
[2409.40 --> 2412.62]  talking to people about stuff that
[2412.62 --> 2414.96]  you think is super cool and and a
[2414.96 --> 2417.18]  shared interest and as long as you
[2417.18 --> 2419.74]  as long as you can find a way to do
[2419.74 --> 2422.38]  that if you can if you are a super
[2422.38 --> 2425.58]  you know gearhead for example and you
[2425.58 --> 2427.54]  can find a way to sell cars for a
[2427.54 --> 2427.82]  living
[2427.82 --> 2430.56]  um well okay that might be a little
[2430.56 --> 2432.40]  bit challenging especially if you're
[2432.40 --> 2436.20]  most of the people coming in to buy a
[2436.20 --> 2439.54]  car are not going to be shopping for
[2439.54 --> 2441.28]  the kind of car that i think a typical
[2441.28 --> 2443.66]  you know gearhead would be excited to
[2443.66 --> 2446.30]  talk about but as long as you as long
[2446.30 --> 2448.82]  as you don't mind just sort of sharing
[2448.82 --> 2450.96]  knowledge and and talking with people
[2450.96 --> 2453.72]  about about cars or about cameras or
[2453.72 --> 2455.62]  about computers or whatever it is that
[2455.62 --> 2456.46]  you're passionate about
[2456.46 --> 2459.52]  i'd say that's the best way to both
[2459.52 --> 2462.82]  enjoy what you're doing and succeed at
[2462.82 --> 2463.40]  what you're doing
[2463.40 --> 2465.02]  there are going to be challenges
[2465.02 --> 2469.32]  you know we got spiffs and we got
[2469.32 --> 2471.40]  guidance from hq on what we were
[2471.40 --> 2473.96]  supposed to be pushing and i gotta tell
[2473.96 --> 2475.68]  you i never even looked at it i didn't
[2475.68 --> 2476.98]  i didn't bother reading any of that
[2476.98 --> 2478.44]  stuff i didn't pay any attention to it
[2478.44 --> 2479.40]  whatsoever because
[2479.40 --> 2481.84]  the way that i saw it i would just you
[2481.84 --> 2484.34]  know do my thing and i'd customers would
[2484.34 --> 2486.36]  be happy and they'd love it and they'd
[2486.36 --> 2487.36]  come back to me and
[2487.36 --> 2489.84]  that would kind of wipe out anything
[2489.84 --> 2492.44]  else and in reality that was probably
[2492.44 --> 2495.10]  pretty naive of me what's more likely
[2495.10 --> 2497.18]  is that ncix just wasn't organized
[2497.18 --> 2499.20]  enough to keep track of which sales
[2499.20 --> 2500.54]  reps were pushing what they're supposed
[2500.54 --> 2502.62]  to be pushing and so they just never
[2502.62 --> 2504.20]  really noticed that i was only selling
[2504.20 --> 2506.30]  the stuff that i really wanted to sell
[2506.30 --> 2511.88]  apparently gearhead means something else
[2511.88 --> 2514.52]  other places okay it would just mean
[2514.52 --> 2518.70]  like car enthusiast um here so i don't
[2518.70 --> 2520.18]  know what else it means like steroids
[2520.18 --> 2523.52]  i have no idea steroids gear yeah ethan
[2523.52 --> 2525.72]  bez says yeah suvs everyone's buying
[2525.72 --> 2528.66]  suvs yay so exciting yeah exactly like i
[2528.66 --> 2531.54]  remember the outrage when uh when porsche
[2531.54 --> 2534.06]  stopped just doing uh you know sports
[2534.06 --> 2536.10]  cars and all of a sudden they've got
[2536.10 --> 2537.84]  like the mccann and the cayenne i think
[2537.84 --> 2539.92]  cayenne excuse me and i think those are
[2539.92 --> 2541.68]  their some of their top selling models
[2541.68 --> 2544.42]  nouns like uh uh are they even an
[2544.42 --> 2548.02]  enthusiast brand anymore totally totally
[2548.02 --> 2550.90]  get it but i don't know you got to find
[2550.90 --> 2553.36]  the fun in in like educating people i i
[2553.36 --> 2555.36]  remember taking my my aunt and uncle
[2555.36 --> 2557.38]  shopping and one of the things that i
[2557.38 --> 2560.40]  was really hammering on was that i wanted
[2560.40 --> 2562.08]  them to get a plug-in hybrid they do so
[2562.08 --> 2564.26]  much of their driving just like padding
[2564.26 --> 2566.40]  around in the city they park in a garage
[2566.40 --> 2569.28]  and they wanted an suv sorry sorry they wanted
[2569.28 --> 2573.18]  an suv but they wanted um but they wanted
[2573.18 --> 2574.36]  something a little bit smaller than the
[2574.36 --> 2575.62]  grand cherokee they had before and i was
[2575.62 --> 2577.86]  like look you guys uh you know i know you
[2577.86 --> 2580.26]  don't have a ton of experience with them i
[2580.26 --> 2583.28]  actually forget exactly which uh which one
[2583.28 --> 2585.74]  they got i think it was uh it's that mitsu
[2585.74 --> 2590.56]  bishi uh ph ev suv what's what's it called
[2590.56 --> 2595.74]  again yeah the outlander p uh outlander ph ev um so i took them to look at it and i was like look
[2595.74 --> 2600.54]  you'll be able to do so many of your trips on
[2600.54 --> 2605.66]  battery just remember to plug this thing in when you go into your garage and like no one at any of the
[2605.66 --> 2610.70]  dealerships they'd been to before i went with them had educated them on the advantage of this
[2610.70 --> 2614.54]  like people just didn't understand plug-in hybrid is such a
[2614.54 --> 2620.04]  such a wasted thing no one ever talks about it
[2620.04 --> 2625.60]  well they're starting to now to people today that there's a difference between hybrid and plug-in
[2625.60 --> 2630.40]  hybrid yeah this the name is really stupid it's bad i don't have a better name
[2630.40 --> 2636.56]  to be honest with you like i understand why the name is what it is because depending on the design
[2636.56 --> 2642.24]  a lot of them bear more similarity to a hybrid than they do to an electric vehicle
[2642.24 --> 2651.04]  yeah but how having it called something so similar i think is extremely confusing to people with you
[2652.40 --> 2658.40]  yeah it's amazing what a difference branding can make to people's understanding of it when they
[2659.44 --> 2665.36]  and i think i think this is something that we we ended up doing one more video about branding nonsense
[2665.36 --> 2671.12]  um even though i'm i didn't want to do any more like mad videos but it was one that we had started
[2671.12 --> 2679.92]  work on a long time ago um and it's uh it's looking at nvidia's most recent transgressions so i'd say
[2679.92 --> 2687.28]  that the 30 56 gig is the most recent one in fact i think that's the last card they launched so we look at
[2687.28 --> 2693.36]  the 30 56 gig and we kind of go okay now hold on a second this is clearly a completely different card
[2693.36 --> 2703.36]  um so while the community got their way with the with the 40 80 12 gig um where they kind of went hey
[2703.36 --> 2710.56]  this is not a 48 this is a completely different gpu aside from having less memory nvidia took all of
[2710.56 --> 2717.20]  that feedback threw it in a fire and immediately kept doing it and then we go back through their history
[2717.20 --> 2723.84]  and we look at some other examples of of nvidia's very deceptive branding and i actually tell a
[2723.84 --> 2730.40]  personal story in the video about one time nvidia bamboozled me before i was knowledgeable enough
[2730.40 --> 2736.08]  to understand how to how to research this stuff and how to learn the differences between things so
[2737.36 --> 2744.88]  in response to your question find a way to get excited about educating people about something that
[2744.88 --> 2751.04]  you're knowledgeable about and that's probably the best way to both have fun at work and succeed in
[2751.04 --> 2759.44]  your job i used to kill it at best buy yeah i bet and i yeah like you were saying you would get pushed
[2759.44 --> 2765.20]  things like oh oh sell a bunch of this sell a bunch of that i always ignored it but i used to go on trip
[2765.20 --> 2768.96]  like when my mom would have to go buy something with best buy i would ask to go with her just so i could
[2768.96 --> 2773.36]  walk around the store so like working there is all excited because i get around be around computers and stuff we
[2773.36 --> 2778.96]  grew up mostly in the country there wasn't a lot of this availability around so a best buy existing
[2778.96 --> 2783.52]  within reasonable driving distance was like cool to have at all and then the fact that i worked there
[2783.52 --> 2788.96]  i was like yeah this is awesome um so it was really easy to sell stuff because people would come in and
[2788.96 --> 2793.36]  ask one a laptop then i would just have a conversation with them about what they needed and like why i
[2793.36 --> 2796.88]  thought different solutions would be good or bad for them and give them a range of options they pick one
[2796.88 --> 2801.92]  of them and then we go for it and my customers are often really happy and it was usually pretty easy
[2801.92 --> 2806.32]  like i wasn't really actually trying to push the sales but i'd have conversations with them about
[2806.96 --> 2812.40]  what software do you need and pretty often it was like oh i do work stuff so i need like word it's
[2812.40 --> 2817.84]  like oh well bonk here's word get that spiff they want it anyway that spiff but they literally they
[2817.84 --> 2824.24]  wanted it anyways yep they would have left the store less less equipped so like i i don't i don't think
[2824.24 --> 2830.64]  i ever sold a single service plan thing except for when the customer asked for it i would never push that
[2830.64 --> 2837.44]  ever because i didn't believe in it like at all but i never bought one ever myself so like well i
[2837.44 --> 2844.00]  bought one technically but then abused it but anyways that's the same st wes 13 says with a plug-in hybrid
[2844.00 --> 2849.12]  aren't you taking on the issues of a gas vehicle and the issues of an ev in one package but aren't you
[2849.12 --> 2856.08]  taking on the advantages of a gas vehicle and of an ev in one package yes you are you're also going to have
[2856.08 --> 2862.32]  more problems with the ice drive train and if you're often driving within distance of your electric
[2862.32 --> 2867.76]  which he was talking about in this specific scenario um then you're not running your your ice drive train
[2867.76 --> 2874.00]  as much and never running your ice drive train is bad yes but as long as you're running it regularly
[2874.00 --> 2879.28]  it should be fine uh mavs guy says and the mitsubishi ph ev is arguably the worst of the bunch
[2879.28 --> 2885.52]  fair enough but this was a few years ago um yeah like i don't think rav4 prime was even out yet so
[2885.52 --> 2891.44]  it was it was a while back it was a while back my hybrid can't have a spare tire which sucks it
[2891.44 --> 2895.84]  probably can you just lose a lot of trunk space i mean anything can have a spare tire if you're
[2895.84 --> 2903.20]  creative yeah you put it in your passenger seat strap it in luke car tips everyone
[2903.20 --> 2909.84]  there's technically a solution to practically everything you just might not like it
[2913.60 --> 2920.88]  all right dan what are we supposed to be doing right now do you guys do announcements now do you
[2920.88 --> 2925.36]  do them later no one can penetrate the batteries in the in the case of a collision okay see there's
[2925.36 --> 2930.08]  still there's still solutions just strap it to the outside like they do on jeeps yeah have the
[2930.08 --> 2934.00]  batteries sitting outside i'm no the spare tire explosive reactive armor
[2936.72 --> 2939.28]  i'm gonna put a spare tire on the back of my car when we leave here
[2940.00 --> 2946.32]  immediately nice yeah back of the tycan good yeah good you can put it like on the trunk like they do
[2946.32 --> 2952.08]  with those like off-road porsches yep yeah that would be sick yeah my like it's a thing my car will
[2952.08 --> 2959.76]  no longer be a tycant it will be a tycan it will have new capabilities that's what i that's what i
[2959.76 --> 2963.52]  always joke with my kids whenever it's like in the shop or disabled for some reason or another
[2963.52 --> 2966.00]  i can't right yeah i always i'll tell them it's the tycant
[2968.56 --> 2974.88]  okay in fairness in fairness it hasn't actually needed to be in the shop for a while but i also
[2974.88 --> 2981.68]  did get this extremely terrifying warning when i was a few blocks from home the other day um that has
[2981.68 --> 2988.00]  not popped up again so i have not taken it into the shop um i haven't even googled this yet because i
[2988.00 --> 2994.80]  forgot about it until now um wait wanna read this for us chassis error continued driving possible
[2994.80 --> 2999.84]  with adjustment see owner's manual what does that even mean what is a chassis error
[3001.76 --> 3010.00]  uh and then there's another one uh okay second work uh second uh message chassis error visit workshop
[3010.56 --> 3016.80]  oh wait is this the same one visit workshop oh yeah no visit workshop continued driving possible
[3016.80 --> 3027.04]  with adjustment i yeah so maybe that's fine maybe it's not good i've got an sos warning right now
[3027.04 --> 3035.36]  sos tele-aid disabled drive to workshop what is sos tele-aid i have a giant button in the center
[3035.36 --> 3041.28]  console that it is i've never pushed scared it's a giant red button under like a flip-up hatch yeah it
[3041.28 --> 3049.12]  would be one of those like on star things or whatever basically yeah perfect good job dan uh
[3049.12 --> 3056.00]  all right should we jump into oh should we jump into announcements yes okay hey we've partnered up
[3056.00 --> 3063.76]  with delta hub to bring you guys this side oh is that zoomed a lot less than usual dan is it also tilted
[3063.76 --> 3071.92]  up oh from when we were dying the hair last week okay uh we've partnered with delta hub to bring you
[3071.92 --> 3078.40]  a special ltt edition of their carpio wrist rests um this one's for the right hand and what makes
[3079.28 --> 3083.44]  it pops up this way and what makes it different from other wrist rests you might have tried is that it
[3083.44 --> 3090.64]  has ptfe teflon feet so it glides along your desk and moves with your hand so your wrists are always
[3090.64 --> 3095.84]  supported wherever you are moving them a bunch of folks here at the office have been using their
[3095.84 --> 3102.64]  carpios so this collab was a long time coming all you've got to do is go to the notification signup
[3102.64 --> 3108.88]  page it's at go.deltahub.io oh my goodness okay i'm not going to try and read this whole thing but
[3108.88 --> 3115.12]  i'm going to get dan to post it in the chat there you go and you can sign up to be the first to know
[3115.12 --> 3127.28]  once these drop on august the 9th um oh oh whoa we've got another big announcement the ltt precision
[3127.28 --> 3135.12]  screwdriver is near you may have seen us tease it before but it is finally dropping very soon in fact
[3135.12 --> 3142.40]  i have the first 100 units under the table right now and you can get a chance to get one

[3159.36 --> 3165.84]  they're precision screwdrivers luke it's not a competition they're cute little boxes anyway the point is
[3165.84 --> 3171.84]  they're so teeny that these are the first 100 we had these air shipped and we're giving you an
[3171.84 --> 3178.64]  opportunity to purchase one before anyone else um we have a pop-up event coming soon so there will be
[3178.64 --> 3184.16]  an in-person opportunity we'll give you details on that in the future but for now what you've got to do
[3184.16 --> 3190.32]  is you've got to join the ltd precision mailing list by monday you can find that at lmg.gg
[3190.32 --> 3197.12]  lmg.com.edu slash precision okay so sign up for a notification before monday and you'll get a chance
[3197.12 --> 3204.32]  to buy one of these at an introductory price so from everyone on the list we're going to select
[3204.32 --> 3207.60]  a hundred people to get early access to the screwdriver
[3210.08 --> 3219.36]  and the price is going to be dictated by how long the cap will spin before stopping
[3220.32 --> 3225.12]  which i was informed of shortly before the show started there is that comic sans dan
[3225.76 --> 3231.44]  i only do everything in comic sans good perfect good all right this product has been in development
[3231.44 --> 3237.92]  for good gravy yeah i guess it's been almost two years now not only is it one of the best feeling

[3244.56 --> 3249.76]  to three bits in there but we've added a ceramic and steel ball bearing in the end cap that makes it one
[3249.76 --> 3258.64]  of the best spinning fidget toys ever so as a bonus for every second that i can spin the end cap of the
[3258.64 --> 3266.00]  precision screwdriver we're going to give each of those 100 people 10 cents off their precision screwdriver
[3266.00 --> 3278.72]  oh 10 cents per second okay uh well okay so the price goes down the longer the longer it's been so
[3278.72 --> 3285.12]  do i do i sandbag it so that i don't have to give as much of a discount no or do i go ham you got to go

[3351.68 --> 3357.20]  to do a topic who watches this show wow the bare minimum thanks thousands of devices are all using
[3357.20 --> 3364.80]  the same key over 200 different device models sold by acer dell hp gigabyte intel and super micro have
[3364.80 --> 3370.88]  had their secure boot protection compromised according to security researchers at binarly
[3371.44 --> 3376.88]  several oems have been replacing the secure boot master key generated by the bios vendor
[3376.88 --> 3382.88]  meaning that all 215 device models have the same master key yeah this is really bad it's all bad
[3382.88 --> 3389.60]  news this week oh i'm so sorry further that cryptographic key was published in a public
[3389.60 --> 3397.20]  github repository in december of 2022 and protected by only a four character password yeah
[3402.88 --> 3408.72]  sorry dude everything is trash by the way i can hear that in your mic oh all right i'll stop
[3408.72 --> 3415.92]  literally fidget spinning yeah thanks luke yeah okay dan are you ready uh let me see maybe uh we'll
[3415.92 --> 3419.76]  if not we'll just do a normal counter we're just gonna roll with it okay okay okay in the meantime
[3419.76 --> 3424.80]  luke you can keep telling us about our topic okay three nope what nope dad it doesn't matter you
[3424.80 --> 3432.48]  should just left the old one we could just do the math fine okay ready and three wait well you
[3432.48 --> 3440.08]  reset it it'll reset okay all right three two one you want me to do a new topic another topic
[3440.08 --> 3448.48]  that was all dude you started it so late yeah i missed what is what is wrong with us it's just
[3448.48 --> 3453.92]  not giving me enough time i mean we work together every week what is happening this was working fine
[3453.92 --> 3459.60]  before the the show started anyway did you start it over no it just automatically automatically resets
[3459.60 --> 3466.08]  i'm gonna lose it dan i'm just trying to give these people money off i don't know what's happening
[3466.08 --> 3473.36]  yeah you made it worse i know how did you do that i don't know the ioc has voted unanimously
[3473.36 --> 3480.72]  to hold an official olympics e-sports competition in 2025 in saudi arabia as both the winter and summer
[3480.72 --> 3487.60]  olympics are only held on evenly numbered years this means it will be its own independent event we already
[3487.60 --> 3492.96]  know some of the games that will be involved and those include league of legends rocket league street
[3492.96 --> 3499.60]  fighter tekken i racing nba 2k and fifa again that is some of the games not all of them where the
[3499.60 --> 3504.80]  heck is starcraft anyways moving forward starcraft oh come on dude it's so competitive what's the
[3504.80 --> 3509.68]  cultural relevance of starcraft there's like 40 people in korea that are going hard when's the last
[3509.68 --> 3515.12]  time they released a game oh i don't know yeah they're league of legends is in here league of legends
[3515.12 --> 3521.52]  is from like 2008 yeah but people play it yeah there's 40 koreans that play starcraft oh
[3521.52 --> 3526.72]  i would still like to watch it it's a very fun game to spectate anyways several popular e-sports
[3526.72 --> 3534.72]  titles are notably absent as the ioc has excluded all first-person shooters as too violent oh yeah
[3535.12 --> 3542.72]  however at a prior olympics e-sports week a shooting competition created inside fortnight's creative mode
[3542.72 --> 3549.52]  was included yeah the previous like olympic e-sports thing was absolute memes do you remember that i do
[3549.52 --> 3553.36]  remember that it was garbage so stupid it was like one of the dumbest things ever so this is something
[3553.36 --> 3561.36]  at least i guess i do like the rocket leagues there rocket league like rocket league deserves more okay
[3561.36 --> 3570.32]  we're trying again ready dan i actually am this time okay i'll stop that just make sure that does work
[3570.32 --> 3576.80]  okay ready yep okay i'm gonna spin it as hard as i can okay ready three two one
[3579.52 --> 3579.84]  okay
[3583.36 --> 3587.92]  it sounds like it's going fast i think it's going it's that's a dollar
[3590.80 --> 3595.52]  did the did the hvac just kick in or is this sounding really weird okay cool
[3595.52 --> 3603.28]  oh you're fine you're fine you're fine two bucks did we ever actually tell them what the pricing is
[3603.28 --> 3608.88]  before the discount i don't think so cool i don't know if we've announced pricing yet three dollars off
[3613.20 --> 3615.52]  350 still going
[3618.00 --> 3618.72]  four dollars
[3618.72 --> 3622.72]  oh i would have been so happy it was 420
[3623.92 --> 3631.36]  4.50 still going going and stop okay 48 you're gonna get four dollars and 80 cents off
[3631.92 --> 3638.08]  so i'm gonna put this back in the box so it's fun for 48 seconds yeah yeah dang yeah
[3640.72 --> 3643.04]  certified certified fidget toy put it away oh
[3643.04 --> 3649.28]  oh he saw me stop playing with it no i can hear it i can hear it every time you spin it it's fun
[3649.84 --> 3651.60]  i'm gonna drive him a nuts
[3655.20 --> 3664.40]  uh the last thing the last thing is uh don't forget to sign up for a notification for the ltt mod mat 59.99
[3664.40 --> 3671.92]  coming soon i saw the payment go out a little while ago so it's very much coming we uh everyone tells
[3671.92 --> 3676.08]  you to use a safe anti-static work surface but we looked at the price and quality of the options
[3676.08 --> 3680.56]  that are available on the market and we felt pc builders and makers were being asked to compromise
[3680.56 --> 3685.36]  between building a better pc and having a safe place to build it so that's why we created the mod
[3685.36 --> 3692.16]  mat in collaboration with mod right the creators of the original and patented mod mat for just 59.99
[3692.72 --> 3697.92]  uh we're this is the oh we've got the latest version of the graphics here now uh you know this is not
[3697.92 --> 3702.48]  the latest version uh the radiator guide has been updated a little bit to look a little bit more like
[3702.48 --> 3708.88]  a radiator there's a few other little tweaks um this is a fairly up-to-date version super excited
[3708.88 --> 3715.12]  about it though so don't forget to sign up for that as well all right what do you want to talk about
[3715.12 --> 3719.60]  what are we supposed to do dan do you just tell us what to do we'll do it sure more topics we're going
[3719.60 --> 3728.08]  to do it more topics okay uh-oh ldt is ai now sure more great news according to a leaked spreadsheet
[3728.08 --> 3736.00]  released by 404 media ai video generator runway was likely trained on a large amount of popular
[3736.00 --> 3742.80]  content such as youtube channels including ldt pixar and amc theaters and multiple disney run channels
[3743.92 --> 3747.52]  document appears to be a curated list of recommended media for scraping
[3747.52 --> 3754.96]  comp for scraping compiled by several runway employees yikes uh the company appears to have
[3754.96 --> 3761.68]  been looking for certain kinds of content and video work ltt was linked to the key phrase using a laptop
[3762.40 --> 3768.72]  that makes sense i guess while there was also a spreadsheet labeled cinematic masterpieces that included
[3770.08 --> 3775.76]  individual channels and videos with particularly high production values including student films it's
[3775.76 --> 3782.24]  unclear if the company actually scraped pirated content but the links to piracy sites are included in
[3782.24 --> 3788.40]  the document um i've this has been a thing for a long time in in early model training stuff to be
[3788.40 --> 3795.68]  clear uh 404 media found that while the runway video generator wouldn't create exact recreations of
[3795.68 --> 3801.36]  real people it produced results that were very reminiscent of some youtube personalities video styles
[3801.36 --> 3809.12]  when their name was uh imputed included either way uh shortly after 404 asked runway for a comment
[3809.12 --> 3816.16]  their video generator stopped producing these results convenient uh a former ploy claim employee claims that
[3816.16 --> 3821.68]  runway used open source software with a proxy configuration to avoid being blocked by youtube while they
[3821.68 --> 3827.04]  scraped the videos uh this is standard practice for scraping to be clear why would you know that i would
[3827.04 --> 3832.24]  why do you know that luke can you explain why you know that please luke uh when reached for a comment
[3832.24 --> 3837.60]  a representative from google reiterated its stance that a company trading its ai on youtube videos without
[3837.60 --> 3845.52]  permission would violate youtube's tos i know that this is going to be a controversial take but
[3847.44 --> 3853.68]  yeah as in you're not surprised yeah i'm not surprised yeah i mean either this is this has been genuinely
[3853.68 --> 3857.92]  happening since like the beginning of this ai scraping stuff i'm pretty sure we talked on the
[3857.92 --> 3865.12]  wan show about how much pirated content was being used to train models like a year ago um people are
[3865.12 --> 3872.96]  saying luke why i didn't do it for this reason relax um yeah i heard something i can't find it right now
[3872.96 --> 3881.36]  i heard something about cloudflare doing something some anti-scraping thing but um cloudflare bot management
[3881.36 --> 3887.68]  is designed to block content scraping attacks yeah so i think they're working on that um which is cool
[3888.80 --> 3898.88]  it's always an arms race i just i i'm i know that there are creators out there who are very upset about
[3898.88 --> 3905.36]  this um and maybe part of it is that i've just come to terms with it over a longer period of time like
[3905.36 --> 3913.68]  i'm not surprised by it it's still not good uh it's still you know illegal but the reality of it is
[3913.68 --> 3920.08]  that it was never going to be any way other than this once you upload something to the internet the
[3920.08 --> 3928.00]  expectation that if it appears on someone else's screen they can have it yes yeah it's it's like it's
[3928.00 --> 3933.76]  like sending it's like sending nudes via snap and then being like oh they auto delete but i thought
[3933.76 --> 3938.96]  it was going to disappear but but you're not allowed to do that with it you're not allowed to keep that
[3941.12 --> 3946.32]  say it again if it appears on someone else's screen they can have it it's just how it works
[3946.32 --> 3952.56]  you'll never stop it because you know maybe they'll lose some of the quality but they could just point
[3952.56 --> 3957.28]  a video camera at their screen yeah like it doesn't matter they'll they'll lose some quality
[3957.28 --> 3962.32]  but they'll still do it they used to have uh move early movie rips at one point in time were just
[3962.32 --> 3967.84]  people holding video cameras in theaters yeah and people would download those the video quality got
[3967.84 --> 3972.72]  to the point where it was pretty good it was the audio that was the issue yeah yeah once the once
[3972.72 --> 3979.36]  the cameras were like on a tripod you know it was it was fine but a lot of the time like it'd be on a
[3979.36 --> 3985.04]  camcorder yeah and so uh the the worst ones the worst ones not that i know saying that they still
[3985.04 --> 3990.32]  do it not that i know anything about this uh but the worst ones i would imagine uh were the ones where
[3990.96 --> 3996.24]  they had especially like a stereo microphone on the camera like you know how some camcorders would
[3996.24 --> 4000.72]  have stereo microphones and there'd be someone yeah there'd be someone like off to the right that was
[4000.72 --> 4007.76]  like eating popcorn the whole time whatever uh did we say the the price of the screw i don't remember
[4007.76 --> 4015.68]  what it is that's why i haven't acknowledged it i don't know yeah i don't know someone will um so
[4015.68 --> 4020.16]  yeah i don't know i i think you can be annoyed about it but i think letting it like consume you
[4020.16 --> 4024.88]  is not the right way to go yeah companies are going to work on anti-scraping stuff and like realistically
[4024.88 --> 4032.48]  okay i i upload this content to youtube or i upload my post to reddit or whatever it's like okay so
[4032.48 --> 4041.28]  some vc funded asshole is benefiting from this and it's not the vc funded asshole that i intended
[4042.72 --> 4048.32]  yeah and and and you know it's not that simple i want my vc funded asshole to have all of it yeah like
[4048.32 --> 4055.20]  which no like which billionaire are we rooting for i just unless it's a fight to the death i'm afraid i just
[4055.20 --> 4061.36]  can't get that invested yeah and and you know what it's that's not that's not it's not that simple
[4061.36 --> 4067.36]  right like obviously google at least split some of the revenue back to the creators and and that is
[4067.36 --> 4072.56]  really different than like what were these guys what were these guys valued at these runway guys who
[4072.56 --> 4085.12]  i i never used their service i might have heard of them once before but it was like billions of dollars or something yeah yeah billions of dollars they generate like zero revenue as far as i can tell i'm sure they generate some
[4085.12 --> 4090.80]  revenue oh okay they were trying to raise 450 million at about a four billion dollar valuation yeah there you go
[4090.80 --> 4095.76]  technically mean they're worth that much yeah there you go so it's like these guys are you know worth
[4095.76 --> 4100.72]  whatever but they're not they're not sharing any of that money that's not even it's not even real money it's all just
[4100.72 --> 4112.40]  like paper vc money right so i'm just looking at it going yeah and um none of this surprises me and i just don't think anything is going to change that much
[4112.40 --> 4120.80]  um michael mc chesney in floatplane chat says the cam version of avengers endgame was actually awesome
[4120.80 --> 4125.36]  because it had all the audience reaction to cool stuff like steve picking up thor's hammer and stuff
[4126.48 --> 4131.76]  that's pretty funny that's actually really it's kind of neat that's that's pretty cool it's like theater
[4131.76 --> 4135.60]  experience it's like having it's like watching with friends but you don't need any friends
[4135.60 --> 4139.20]  it's very convenient for you yeah honestly though
[4141.84 --> 4150.56]  dude i haven't watched a movie in the theater room since i got back from my last trip
[4152.64 --> 4158.72]  in the theater room yeah so it's been like weeks oh wow yeah that's actually surprising yeah i i i wish i
[4158.72 --> 4164.40]  found more time to use it with that said it's summer and without even thinking about it our
[4164.40 --> 4170.72]  family has kind of a seasonality to our activities i i was kind of feel toward the end of the winter i
[4170.72 --> 4176.16]  was kind of feeling like man we just default to playing video games and like watching movies all
[4176.16 --> 4179.76]  the time we should get out more we should get out more and then summer came out and i'm like
[4180.72 --> 4186.48]  why do i even have a theater room we never use the bloody thing so it's probably fine it's probably fine
[4186.48 --> 4192.24]  yeah i i genuinely i'm sure there's something that i did in between then but the last time i really
[4192.24 --> 4195.28]  remember going to the theater was the last time you and i went to a star wars movie
[4198.24 --> 4204.08]  dude that was yeah that was a minute ago i just stopped caring no that's not true it was also with
[4204.08 --> 4209.44]  you though yeah kingsman i'm 99 sure this was actually the last time no we went to go watch barbie
[4209.44 --> 4213.44]  oh yeah barbie was sick though yeah yeah okay before that was probably kings was probably
[4213.44 --> 4219.20]  king's been three star wars i haven't been that into kingsman three sucked movies in a while yeah
[4219.20 --> 4225.28]  i used to go to movie theater pretty often in like the low 20s well you and everyone theater industry
[4225.28 --> 4230.24]  is struggling hard yeah super hard a lot of stuff releasing and i'm just not that interesting
[4230.24 --> 4236.08]  lmusic's 96 and floatplane chat goes i used to cam ltt content just because i missed the 2000s okay
[4236.08 --> 4247.68]  dude what the is going on i already knew about the trend where zoomers are buying like retro digital
[4247.68 --> 4253.28]  cameras right like you know how millennials got into film cameras because they were retro and like
[4253.28 --> 4259.12]  polaroids bad digital cameras so zoomers are buying like crappy digital cameras dude i hope for the no
[4259.12 --> 4266.00]  no no no no this gets so much worse this gets so much worse okay they're buying like crappy digital
[4266.00 --> 4275.76]  cameras for the aesthetic i uh the the idea of spending money on this it gives me physical pain
[4275.76 --> 4283.92]  um we did colin's amd ultimate tech upgrade and we didn't even make it to the computer before i just about
[4283.92 --> 4292.80]  had my eyes roll out of my sockets by one of his purchases okay he bought a little video input box
[4293.44 --> 4300.48]  that has a little screen on it has a little battery on it and a micro sd slot that plugs into the output
[4300.48 --> 4304.64]  the analog output of like a crappy tape camcorder
[4304.64 --> 4316.16]  see i broke his brain people are going they're acquiring like old tape camcorders and then they're
[4316.80 --> 4324.24]  they are getting these micro sd recording boxes so that they can get that like that like behind the
[4324.24 --> 4331.60]  scenes early 2000s skate video i was gonna say aesthetic i hope they bring back fisheye lens skate videos
[4331.60 --> 4338.48]  because those were sick i was looking through the like peephole on my door the other day and i i got
[4338.48 --> 4348.16]  nostalgic for old fish island skate videos oh yeah all right anyway um things were cool oh man oh man
[4348.16 --> 4355.92]  tape camcorders are brat says nice east of east and you know i embrace it do what you want yeah do what
[4355.92 --> 4359.68]  you want get some get some yeah somebody mentioned super aids get some super aids why not why you gotta
[4359.68 --> 4366.80]  spend poor amd's money on that how much was it like how much are these old cameras going for i have
[4366.80 --> 4371.60]  no idea i can't imagine there's actually honestly even that many that are like in good condition still
[4373.04 --> 4378.88]  like getting a good quality one in good condition is probably pretty hard i swear i swear every single
[4378.88 --> 4383.76]  time i try to open up facebook it asked me to log in again it used to be one of the
[4384.64 --> 4389.20]  least annoying services it's probably good you shouldn't be logged in on that computer
[4389.68 --> 4395.20]  is that because people keep logging me out i actually don't know i blame you people good
[4396.16 --> 4403.28]  good job when in doubt blame you people yep uh enter zip code what do you mean zip code you must know
[4403.28 --> 4408.56]  approximately speaking of blaming you people i'm gonna give dan some credit here one of the first
[4408.56 --> 4414.16]  things are we blaming him no one of the first things i tasked dan with when uh we started working
[4414.16 --> 4419.92]  together was to fix the wan show i hadn't even thought about it yeah that's that's the goal yeah
[4419.92 --> 4426.32]  in like a super long time yeah isn't that nice i don't i don't freak out the entire show anymore yeah
[4426.32 --> 4432.32]  i i just i i realized like i don't even remember when but i was like remember when that was like a problem
[4432.96 --> 4441.20]  yeah it used to be really stressful it sucked i refinished the table today oh yeah sort of i did my best
[4441.20 --> 4446.08]  attempts were made you should have seen it before yeah did you see the picture yeah yeah the the
[4446.08 --> 4451.20]  dye bottle or the bleach bottle like foamed and overflowed and wrecked the finish on the table yeah
[4451.20 --> 4455.60]  i bet you guys didn't even notice though especially because my water bottles there no there you go yeah
[4455.60 --> 4462.08]  exactly sanded it stained it and oiled the table oh it needs filling probably would have said don't
[4462.08 --> 4466.64]  bother doing that it was really obvious like extremely bad yeah but i would have just done this
[4466.64 --> 4474.48]  yeah that's cheating no it's fine oh okay well anyway here's uh here's what camcorders are worth
[4475.28 --> 4484.08]  oh my goodness okay yeah i was talking to wait that's actually a super eight isn't it yeah whoa i was
[4484.08 --> 4494.64]  joking oh yeah no these are like apparently worth money at least if they work ah based i was talking to mark
[4494.64 --> 4501.84]  and uh he's convinced me that i think we should go in for the purchase of a crt camera um you know
[4501.84 --> 4507.36]  that old media if you've ever seen acura or something like that where the bikes are going past the screen
[4507.36 --> 4513.12]  and their lights have giant trails behind them yeah that's a real camera that can do that and it's a crt
[4513.12 --> 4520.32]  tube camera which is kind of insane i think those should be what would we use it for nothing no not for
[4520.32 --> 4528.32]  not for you oh just for personal use oh yeah okay well you guys enjoy that i just then do whatever you'd
[4528.32 --> 4539.28]  like yeah you can do whatever you like um i am i no it's the children who are wrong
[4539.28 --> 4550.24]  i honestly no it's the children who are wrong you know what's messing me up cds are invoke
[4550.72 --> 4559.52]  right what is up with that cassettes vinyl fine cds no it's good it's it's just a light it's just it's
[4559.52 --> 4564.96]  just an mp3 with extra steps it's great it's spotify but you have to store it somewhere that's good
[4564.96 --> 4572.72]  unbelievable unbelievable that cds are trendy imagine we came back to consoles with cartridges
[4572.72 --> 4578.00]  i can't that'd be so dude the switch still exists all right i'm not even dead yet yeah
[4579.04 --> 4585.04]  i'll be using a long time oh laser disc let's bring back laser laser disc i bought a friend
[4585.04 --> 4589.68]  laser disc for for his birthday actually nice that's awesome all right
[4589.68 --> 4596.96]  it'd be like cds actually sound so much better than streaming i mean yeah if you don't you could
[4596.96 --> 4602.32]  but you can stream flax like you can stream high quality files you don't have to stream the lowest
[4602.32 --> 4608.56]  quality thing and realistically you're probably listening to it on your airpods anyway so i don't
[4608.56 --> 4613.60]  know okay okay if you're if you're talking about the better quality of you know cd recordings then yeah
[4613.60 --> 4618.96]  you're probably not but still all right what are we what are what else is there to talk about uh
[4620.16 --> 4626.48]  we're doing that oh man we could talk about the canadians getting caught spying with drones yeah
[4626.48 --> 4632.56]  what's going on yeah so a coach for the canadian women's soccer team has been suspended following an
[4632.56 --> 4637.68]  accusation from the new zealand team that the canadian side used drones to spy on two of their practice
[4637.68 --> 4643.12]  sessions notably the canadian women's team is the defending gold medalist and ranked eighth in the world
[4643.12 --> 4649.92]  while the new zealand team is ranked 28th it's like really media reports have surfaced also that
[4649.92 --> 4655.04]  the team might have used similar tactics at previous tournaments including the last olympics
[4656.08 --> 4661.44]  which has the potential to affect their past title now canada soccer head kevin blue says that the
[4661.44 --> 4666.56]  canadian men's team also attempted to use a drone to gather information during their recent copa america
[4666.56 --> 4672.96]  tournament in the u.s their coach jesse marsh has denounced the practice as has john herdman who coached
[4672.96 --> 4679.92]  the women's team from 2011 to 2018 and the men's team from 2018 to 2023 uh christine sinclair who was
[4679.92 --> 4687.52]  the team captain in 2020 denies that players had knowledge of this spying the optics are terrible
[4687.52 --> 4691.76]  yeah for this and the evidence is probably not on the drones though is is
[4691.76 --> 4702.56]  got it the evidence is non-zero um and i think that this this raises a ton of questions about fairness
[4702.56 --> 4709.20]  in sport and how technology is changing it that shouldn't be because they got caught which means
[4709.20 --> 4711.04]  there's others doing it almost certainly which means there's others doing it almost certainly which
[4711.04 --> 4714.56]  means there's others doing it especially with how long they've been doing it and one of the people that
[4714.56 --> 4719.76]  was interviewed about this and talking about like how uncomfortable it made them that they were being asked to
[4719.76 --> 4726.00]  record this but you know feared retribution and didn't want to speak out or whatever was talking about how yeah they don't always use a drone
[4726.56 --> 4730.56]  like if they know where the team's going to be practicing they can just like get a hotel room
[4730.56 --> 4736.48]  oh yeah yeah there's so just because there wasn't a drone flying over your practice doesn't mean that
[4736.48 --> 4741.52]  a competitor wasn't watching it considering it said that the coach had denounced the practice
[4741.52 --> 4746.88]  like the way that's worded this sounds like it's like a huge deal um that's a different coach
[4746.88 --> 4752.40]  so head coach but saying that what i'm saying is the way that that's worded it sounds like this is
[4752.40 --> 4756.48]  more of a global thing i'm sure other teams are probably also doing it i don't know and i don't
[4756.48 --> 4760.96]  want to deflect the ones who were caught enough were the canadians that's fair enough yeah that's
[4760.96 --> 4767.68]  simple in that context um and i don't know man so they they beat new zealand in their match already
[4767.68 --> 4774.88]  are we just gonna are we just gonna yeah what do we do yeah what what do we what do we do with this
[4774.88 --> 4782.40]  and it's not like 100 confirmed dude dude dude french authorities got the drone oh they they caught
[4783.20 --> 4788.32]  they caught a canadian soccer uh like i think they were an associate coach or something i forget exactly
[4788.32 --> 4793.92]  who it was but they caught someone affiliated with canadian soccer retrieving the drone and found footage
[4793.92 --> 4800.16]  of not just that practice but another one so it was not like oh yeah i don't know maybe i'll like
[4800.16 --> 4808.32]  do this one time no this was an effort that was made not cool yeah i mean if you get caught cheating
[4808.32 --> 4813.44]  you should get you should get tons of crap for it yeah the coaches uh coaches were sent home man
[4814.08 --> 4819.92]  rough for the team will we ever have an olympics that isn't just full of scandal no
[4819.92 --> 4826.64]  man do you see the anything with that level of competition you see the dressage uh athlete i don't
[4826.64 --> 4832.08]  know i've never really understood that as a sport the way that some other sports yeah it's like uh
[4832.08 --> 4837.44]  competitive making a horse contort its body into weird positions while you ride around on it
[4837.44 --> 4847.68]  yeah no yeah i have not uh speaking of the wang show doing really good apparently it's down
[4849.12 --> 4854.40]  so we'll get that sorted out of course when dan's gone pretty soon yeah that figures um
[4855.04 --> 4857.28]  anyway why don't we jump into our next topic here
[4860.16 --> 4860.96]  which is
[4863.36 --> 4867.28]  oh how's the ldt screwdriver holding up the first college sports game
[4867.28 --> 4875.20]  in 11 years i'm actually kind of happy about this one after launching last friday
[4875.20 --> 4880.40]  ea's college football 25 is already looking to be one of the biggest games of the year
[4880.40 --> 4887.20]  having sold over 2.2 million pre-order copies this is the first game in the series in over a decade
[4887.20 --> 4894.80]  after the last game ncaa football 15 was cancelled during development a major factor in the hiatus was a
[4894.80 --> 4901.60]  high profile lawsuit by former ncaa players that the series had used thousands of student athletes
[4901.60 --> 4911.12]  likeness without payment or permission all of which is really bad but uh although we'll get to that soon
[4911.12 --> 4916.32]  so the national collegiate athletics association had strict requirements preventing student athletes
[4916.32 --> 4920.96]  from making money from sponsorships or leasing their likenesses which is terrible because it wanted
[4920.96 --> 4926.88]  them to be seen as amateurs which would shield universities from needing to pay them or compensate
[4926.88 --> 4933.92]  them in case of injury also terrible ea wanted an exception to these rules but when the ncaa refused
[4933.92 --> 4939.92]  the game company proceeded to use the likenesses with the names of the athletes removed the suit was settled
[4939.92 --> 4946.96]  with ea paying 40 million and the ncaa paying 20 million in damages so basically
[4946.96 --> 4955.92]  it was a competition of who can find the best gaps in the rules to exploit student athletes and keep as
[4955.92 --> 4963.12]  much of the reward for themselves as possible this is pretty normal but in may it's good in may of this
[4963.12 --> 4972.08]  year the ncaa reached a legal settlement that allows student athletes to be paid freaking finally it's
[4972.08 --> 4978.88]  it's very good paid for their work ea jumped into action and contacted around 11 000 student athletes
[4978.88 --> 4984.72]  over 10 000 of which have agreed to have their likeness in the new game over the course of three
[4984.72 --> 4992.80]  months the company used cutting edge ai projection software to create 3d avatars of each of those
[4992.80 --> 4998.16]  players who will be compensated though okay so someone's getting paid even if it's not the artists
[4998.16 --> 5003.84]  and have the opportunity to make more money by promoting the game ea has also promised to prevent
[5003.84 --> 5009.84]  users from adding players who didn't agree to be included which as someone who's generally pro modding
[5009.84 --> 5020.96]  though i am mixed on uh i'm not mixed on it if you can add in other made-up players sure okay sure yeah
[5021.52 --> 5027.68]  okay they said specifically ai players that didn't agree to be included i know but if as a modder i can add in a
[5027.68 --> 5033.28]  made-up player then i can add in a made-up player who is a real player sure right okay so i'm just
[5033.28 --> 5040.24]  saying if ea specifically puts in countermeasures against adding you know my own modded players no
[5040.24 --> 5045.04]  i'm generally not that chill with that yeah i agree but it the way it's worded it sounds like they're
[5045.04 --> 5050.08]  they're probably making it so you can't like name players after people name custom players after people
[5050.08 --> 5054.32]  that don't want to be included stuff like that i actually i kind of like that approach i like that
[5054.32 --> 5059.12]  that's how i read this i'm not sure if that's what's going to create any likeness you want and
[5059.12 --> 5064.88]  import it into the game but you can't just make them that player yeah um so our discussion question
[5064.88 --> 5069.68]  isn't this ideally how these kinds of rights disputes should work i mean it shouldn't take 10 years
[5070.88 --> 5077.68]  this problem shouldn't have existed in the first place uh the way that student athletes are exploited is
[5077.68 --> 5085.60]  deplorable it's disgusting um but hey i'm not gonna and and yeah everyone who participated in
[5085.60 --> 5094.16]  this basically sucks however however i'm not gonna knock progress and this feels like progress to me
[5094.16 --> 5101.76]  i'm happy to see it yeah yeah rivian says no to apple carplay based really no i don't care i just knew
[5101.76 --> 5108.96]  you'd react that way dude no i strongly disagree i hate it um their ceo says that rivian will not
[5108.96 --> 5114.80]  be adding carplay to their vehicles as rationale they explained that carplay reflects apple's ethos
[5114.80 --> 5119.76]  of a controlled ecosystem and wouldn't be consistent with the rest of the infotainment system in
[5119.76 --> 5124.40]  particular it would require drivers to exit out of the app before they could access other important
[5124.40 --> 5130.24]  features like opening the vehicle's front trunk rivian will however be integrating many features offered
[5130.24 --> 5136.80]  by carplay into its own system our discussion question here is why doesn't the trunk have its own
[5136.80 --> 5146.00]  button that is the real question here is why i need to use the screen to do that in the first place
[5146.00 --> 5154.72]  big agree no my screen in my car should absolutely allow me to use android auto or carplay or and don't
[5154.72 --> 5159.44]  quote me on this but i remember having a conversation with someone where they basically were like yeah i don't
[5159.44 --> 5165.44]  think anything would really prevent you from doing a pip like like running carplay or android auto in a
[5165.44 --> 5173.28]  window and maintaining some interface around it not having android auto or carplay is not anything that
[5173.28 --> 5179.60]  anyone says it's because they want to have the data instead of giving it to google or apple certainly and
[5179.60 --> 5188.16]  fair enough just understand that i will never buy your car because i am not interested especially
[5188.16 --> 5195.84]  seeing what just happened with fisker i am and like rivian is by no means immune to the same fate as
[5195.84 --> 5201.60]  fisker they seem to be doing a lot better they seem to actually they seem like they're gonna make it so i'm
[5201.60 --> 5206.72]  not saying i'm not saying rivian's you know going bad or anything like that i'm just saying they're
[5206.72 --> 5213.44]  absolutely not immune to disappearing at some point in the next two years five years 10 years 20 years
[5213.44 --> 5221.68]  doesn't matter i want my infotainment system to be just plug in and run whatever updated device that
[5221.68 --> 5227.12]  i'm running at that time i do not want to be locked into and beholden to your software updates
[5227.12 --> 5236.80]  not cool and i will just never buy a rivian ever and uh good for you i guess not that you really
[5236.80 --> 5243.92]  apparently has a poll on that website called x um would you consider buying a car that does not
[5243.92 --> 5252.80]  have android auto or apple carplay uh and almost 60 of people said no with almost 200 000 votes
[5252.80 --> 5263.28]  so there you go you have just locked yourself out of 57.6 of the market good job if i was an investor
[5263.28 --> 5269.52]  in rivian and obviously this is an imperfect poll and you know sampling and blah blah blah blah blah
[5270.72 --> 5279.84]  but i would say if there was a demo that overlapped more perfectly with rivian's potential customer base
[5279.84 --> 5287.60]  than marquez's show me one show it to me yeah really right like these are these are these are
[5287.60 --> 5293.92]  tech interested people ev interested people i i assume they have a lot of interests that align with
[5293.92 --> 5299.76]  mr marquez brownlee himself um i'm sorry i i just don't really i just don't really buy it
[5300.56 --> 5309.20]  uh dan did you make that poll it's too softly worded what's our poll uh car with android auto or apple
[5309.20 --> 5315.28]  car play yes it should have it or no i'm okay without it okay i don't even see the results but
[5315.28 --> 5322.80]  that's fine it's it's even more strong yes it should have it is like 75 but um it's not like i refuse to
[5322.80 --> 5327.84]  buy a car without it and the thing is that i'm not even i'm not even saying that i'm not even saying that
[5327.84 --> 5334.08]  i'm not even saying that i want to have to use it there are things that i prefer like by a long shot
[5334.08 --> 5341.92]  about tesla's interface the fact that my nanny stupid android auto won't let me input text while
[5341.92 --> 5349.36]  i'm moving drives me absolutely bananas in a lot of cases it is far more distracting to try to vocalize
[5349.36 --> 5356.88]  an address for example versus just typing like two numbers in and then having it auto complete for me and
[5356.88 --> 5368.88]  and going um tesla so just vastly superior in that way what just don't worry about it i'm asking the
[5368.88 --> 5380.16]  real questions here luke should rivian have firefox on their infotainment system i mean 77 of people so
[5380.16 --> 5385.84]  far are saying yes this is what full plane is here for yeah yeah all right every you every user on full
[5385.84 --> 5393.20]  plane uses firefox 78 now and you as well yeah yeah it's official i do i do use firefox now for
[5393.20 --> 5400.72]  i have more good news intel has a plan do they they say again they have discovered the cause of the
[5400.72 --> 5405.84]  widespread instability issues affecting their high-end 13th and 14th gen cpus or i should say
[5405.84 --> 5411.76]  especially high-end an issue with the microcode algorithm that caused the cpu to request elevated
[5411.76 --> 5416.72]  operating voltage beyond safe levels the company says they will deliver a patch addressing the
[5416.72 --> 5422.24]  problem in august this will not repair processors that are already crashing due to past damage but it
[5422.24 --> 5428.24]  should prevent further damage on processors that are not intel has pledged to replace cpus for all
[5428.24 --> 5433.76]  affected users it is not yet clear whether some cpus have suffered invisible damage that may cause them
[5433.76 --> 5439.60]  to fail prematurely in the future beyond intel there's more bad news in cpu land amd has delayed the launch of
[5439.60 --> 5444.80]  their ryzen 9000 series cpus from the end of july to mid-august after they found some kind of flaw in
[5444.80 --> 5450.32]  the first batch of chips during final checks although i say bad news because it's like bad news for amd's
[5450.32 --> 5454.72]  bottom line but it's actually good news the fact that these didn't make it to customers means that the
[5454.72 --> 5461.60]  reputational damage is just oh yeah amd you know bunged up there delayed their launch compared to amd shipped
[5461.60 --> 5470.40]  broken products to their customers yeah so i'm i'm i'm pretty i'm excited to see how ryzen 9000 shakes up we
[5470.40 --> 5477.52]  haven't tested it yet obviously because nobody has working chips then nobody can test it uh but based
[5477.52 --> 5482.72]  on amd's claims looks like it's gonna be pretty good and being able to just put it in as a drop-in
[5482.72 --> 5488.48]  replacement for ryzen 7000 it's pretty exciting i don't have an x3d chip so i'm kind of eyeing it
[5492.08 --> 5498.64]  yeah thanks luke good contribution sorry yeah do you want do you want to do you want to tell the uh
[5498.64 --> 5504.56]  the the story about why you're talking less today i can yeah all right so once upon a time linus never
[5504.56 --> 5510.88]  let luke talk on wan show and whenever luke tried linus immediately started talking again anyway and
[5510.88 --> 5515.84]  basically what's the point of even luke being here none of us are sure sorry but i've just been
[5515.84 --> 5520.72]  here the whole time so just no one really wants to change it yeah it's like that picture it's it's
[5520.72 --> 5525.12]  like that magnet on the fridge like no one even remembers who put it there anymore it has no
[5525.12 --> 5529.52]  significance at all but everyone will put it back because it's like just supposed to be there it falls
[5529.52 --> 5537.12]  down you always you always put it back there yeah um yeah no i i had dental work done recently and um
[5537.12 --> 5545.92]  um it it didn't like heal fully properly so dental damn my i shouldn't be making him smile it's actually
[5545.92 --> 5552.96]  really mean he's in a lot of pain i'm sorry luke so my my gums and my jaw were like inflamed not
[5552.96 --> 5558.72]  infected just inflamed and swollen um but as i've talked about on my show before i have weird
[5559.52 --> 5565.92]  what are the eustachian tubes or whatever they're called um the the swelling of that caused my
[5567.12 --> 5572.16]  ear to kind of crush a little bit i guess i don't know and then i went swimming after last
[5572.16 --> 5576.32]  wandshow this is the theory this is the theory that the doctor has not not me but it makes a lot
[5576.32 --> 5581.36]  of sense um i went swimming and and maybe some of the pool water had a hard time getting out
[5581.36 --> 5587.84]  so then i developed an ear infection because of that i went to my dentist because i thought that
[5587.84 --> 5592.32]  made sense because i had this pain in my jaw and i was like maybe that's causing the pain in the ear
[5592.32 --> 5598.56]  and the dentist was like yeah that's probably what's happening so just like here's a here's a
[5598.56 --> 5603.44]  little manual squishy water thing and like clean your teeth out after you eat stuff and just keep
[5603.44 --> 5607.84]  the area really clear for a while and it'll it'll heal up so i thought all the pain i was feeling in
[5607.84 --> 5615.60]  my ear this whole time was because of the tooth stuff so i've had an untreated ear infection for a
[5615.60 --> 5621.84]  week and just been in pain constantly the entire week um and i finally i went to the doctor today
[5621.84 --> 5628.08]  to get like a second opinion and he was like oh yeah nice your ear is uh not doing great so now i'm
[5628.08 --> 5631.92]  on antibiotics and some other stuff is going on i have ear drops and all this kind of stuff but that
[5631.92 --> 5638.80]  started today so uh the pain kind of comes in waves so right now we're we're a little we started the
[5638.80 --> 5644.08]  show low right now it's kind of high and i suspect it'll go back down pretty soon and that's just how
[5644.08 --> 5651.84]  it's been going this whole time um so yeah that's where i'm at i was supposed to fly to wisconsin
[5651.84 --> 5658.88]  tomorrow i am no longer doing that oh yeah yeah that's not happening because it's already a problem
[5659.84 --> 5665.36]  like even even when i don't have an ear infection my my ears popping coming up and down is like already
[5665.36 --> 5670.72]  an issue right um so like now it's like the yeah the doctor was like yeah no you might rupture your
[5670.72 --> 5676.88]  eardrum you're not flying i was like okay well it's a good thing you checked yes because that's
[5676.88 --> 5684.88]  pretty scary yeah and like last i checked when you're like you know at 40 000 feet or whatever it is
[5685.76 --> 5693.44]  immediate medical care not really not awesome not really an option yeah um yeah that's unfortunate
[5693.44 --> 5699.92]  i can't i don't think i can say on the show what i was going to go do there because it would be a
[5699.92 --> 5704.40]  spoiler for somebody else but it was going to be cool and i'm sad it's not happening now that's a
[5704.40 --> 5711.28]  bummer it's all right i'm just collapsing topics we've already done yeah yeah it's like pretty much
[5711.28 --> 5716.40]  everything we have the screwdriver thing and we have the companies using copilot i want to do the copilot
[5716.40 --> 5722.56]  one all right corporate early adopters of microsoft's copilot ai assistant say they're still
[5722.56 --> 5728.24]  struggling to integrate it into their workflow one widespread issue is that it needs to be fed
[5728.24 --> 5734.00]  lots of data in order to work effectively but if the wrong information is included that can make it
[5734.00 --> 5739.60]  a target for hacking it can also wind up being a back door for employees to spy on their co-workers or
[5739.60 --> 5745.36]  projects elsewhere in the company unless its users are willing to extensively rework back-end labeling and
[5745.36 --> 5751.84]  permissions for this information yikes that makes sense about that actually yeah like if we dumped
[5751.84 --> 5759.12]  the contents of our server into a large language model it would be a disaster you'd be able to ask
[5759.12 --> 5764.08]  it about things for sure yeah yeah why not um copilot apparently does well when summarizing and
[5764.08 --> 5770.32]  distilling information but struggles to understand the context of certain requests it can handle commands
[5770.32 --> 5775.12]  that only involve one app but struggles when dealing with multiple apps though these companies
[5775.12 --> 5779.60]  report better results when employees are specifically trained how to use copilot i thought that was
[5779.60 --> 5784.48]  the whole idea behind ai assistance behind digital assistance in the first place was that it was
[5784.48 --> 5791.28]  supposed to be natural interaction i've resisted rollouts um in the company that don't involve
[5791.28 --> 5795.36]  people that are going to spend a decently significant amount of time learning how to use it properly
[5795.36 --> 5800.24]  because of this type of stuff there's a i thought this was going to talk about a previous report that
[5800.24 --> 5805.04]  came out of microsoft that's actually super interesting they released like a some form of
[5805.04 --> 5814.32]  like research document on early adoption um to to copilot in businesses and they they talked very
[5814.32 --> 5819.92]  transparently actually about how it was in a lot of cases bad they're like yeah people's output is higher
[5819.92 --> 5825.60]  but their quality of output is lower and their total errors is higher because they're just submitting ai
[5827.04 --> 5832.64]  work and not properly checking it and the whole thing with ai work is you need to read through it
[5832.64 --> 5838.80]  because it looks convincing but it can just pull information out of nowhere that literally doesn't exist and
[5838.80 --> 5844.56]  make stuff up um so it can be a problem so you want to be careful using it in different uh different
[5844.56 --> 5850.88]  realms and you know what else you should use our sponsor what do you have for breakfast this morning

[6073.28 --> 6078.48]  i i can't exactly remember the game is absolutely amazing but the creators of it aren't getting paid
[6078.48 --> 6091.44]  oh oh uh is it publisher related okay thank you okay well i uh will okay uh uh uh merch messages

[6116.48 --> 6124.16]  for linux okay uh luke what is your take on so many bugs making it into production products lately the
[6124.16 --> 6129.68]  crowd strike outage secure boot exploits it seems like nobody wants to validate before deployment
[6129.68 --> 6134.56]  anymore are we supposed to be after dark right now dan no oh we're still in the middle of the show
[6135.20 --> 6140.72]  uh when you're promoting moving as fast as possible more things are going to break um i don't know
[6140.72 --> 6146.56]  there there's been bugs shipped in code for all eternity and there will be more moving forward i think
[6146.56 --> 6153.12]  people's expectations of levels of polish have practically always gone up um
[6155.36 --> 6161.12]  the the crowd strike thing i mean if you look into i don't know do i want to go down this if you look
[6161.12 --> 6167.52]  into the history of the the ceo he was uh the head of another antivirus company when there was another
[6167.52 --> 6175.84]  massive global crazy issue um so maybe there's some attachment there um i'm not sitting here trying to
[6175.84 --> 6180.00]  project that this person writes all the code and pushes all the code and makes those types of
[6180.00 --> 6185.28]  decisions but it could be a situation where they're pushing for speed maybe a little bit too much and
[6185.28 --> 6189.52]  those types of issues are able to slip through i'm not sure but those types of environment environments
[6189.52 --> 6196.64]  can cater to that type of problem um companies used to qa before releasing software and games yeah they
[6196.64 --> 6202.32]  still do um i don't think it's fair to say that they they don't anymore and i don't think it's fair to
[6202.32 --> 6206.56]  say that they actually really did in the past there's lots of cartridge games that released
[6206.56 --> 6212.56]  that were literally impossible to complete i'm so far ahead of you i'm so ready what final fantasy 6
[6212.56 --> 6220.32]  has a very famous bug uh the evade stat on the snes version does absolutely nothing yeah it just it just
[6221.12 --> 6226.72]  your evade stat can be higher it can be lower it doesn't work it doesn't do anything how something
[6226.72 --> 6232.56]  like that would have made it into a finished game yeah that's wild it's it's mind-boggling until you
[6232.56 --> 6238.24]  consider that software is buggy and people are human and bugs exist and there was no way to patch it
[6238.24 --> 6242.40]  once they started shipping cartridges that's it see you later i do think patching things these days
[6242.40 --> 6249.68]  is more convenient so people have put less intention and less value into pre-testing i wasn't done okay
[6249.68 --> 6255.04]  because we all need an update on whether you're ever going to finish playing that bloody game
[6257.04 --> 6260.88]  yes i am uh i actually have a very convenient excuse this weekend
[6261.68 --> 6265.52]  really because i was supposed to be out of the country and now i won't be so maybe i'll play it now
[6266.08 --> 6270.96]  oh you mean an excuse to play it as opposed to an excuse to not play it no i'm gonna ask you next
[6270.96 --> 6273.76]  week and you're gonna be like yeah i was gonna play it on the plane but then i didn't take the plane
[6273.76 --> 6278.88]  see i'm also way ahead of your excuses you want to know something funny
[6281.60 --> 6286.32]  the controller is packed in my bag for the plane because i was gonna play it on the plane
[6286.32 --> 6293.76]  you want to know something really funny yeah i shot a video with david this week he's liquidating a ton
[6293.76 --> 6299.28]  of his retro collection oh which you guys will actually get a shot at uh so i worked i worked this
[6299.28 --> 6304.40]  up with david where it's it's not like it's not like a business negotiation there was no handshake but
[6304.96 --> 6311.28]  um he was he's uh liquidating a lot of his retro collection because he's moving into um a new place
[6311.84 --> 6318.88]  and i was like oh well maybe we could do like a tech hoarders episode but you know i always i always
[6318.88 --> 6326.96]  believe that deals should be win-win and so i was like okay normally it would be a little bit weird
[6326.96 --> 6333.44]  optics wise to like use the platform of the company to promote a personal sale but if the
[6333.44 --> 6340.80]  company is getting a video out of it and also like we're gonna do a follow-up video on his like retro
[6340.80 --> 6347.68]  gaming cave at his new place okay that has a lot less memorabilia but has like upgraded gear that was
[6347.68 --> 6356.24]  funded by selling the memorabilia but then it's almost like an ultimate tech upgrade but entirely self-funded
[6356.24 --> 6363.36]  but then the company could maybe contribute like some resources like laser time and machine time
[6363.36 --> 6369.36]  to make some cool decor and like so figuring out how to have it how to create some synergies here so
[6369.36 --> 6376.96]  anyway i was shooting this video with david and uh he was he was he came to me partially in addition to
[6376.96 --> 6385.76]  all that because he needed some help and the help he needed was the kick in the butt that he needed to
[6386.72 --> 6393.20]  get rid of a lot more of it than he otherwise would have um where was i going with this i completely
[6393.20 --> 6397.44]  forget where we where we started we were talking about right right so so there were a couple of
[6397.44 --> 6404.40]  things so one i made him get rid of so much more than he planned he i've seen david stressed we've
[6404.40 --> 6410.40]  worked together a very long time man he's got is he had his five years might be did he start pre-covid
[6410.40 --> 6417.36]  he's got to be darn close did he start pre-covid i think so then yeah dude anyway he's he's got to
[6417.36 --> 6420.96]  be around there somewhere the point is david and i've not only worked together for a long time now
[6420.96 --> 6426.08]  but we've worked together a lot i tend to work with the camera team more than anybody else because
[6426.08 --> 6434.08]  that's what i spend most of my time doing is shooting um so where was i going with this right i've
[6434.08 --> 6441.52]  seen him stressed dude you will you have never seen tension like this in an ldt video where i was
[6441.52 --> 6450.32]  like he brought me in to like push him to de hoarder fi his situation but he collected all this stuff
[6450.32 --> 6458.48]  because he like wants it and he had already sorted it before i got there and like was open to
[6459.28 --> 6466.00]  me pushing him harder but was not enjoying it um but one of the things that i did to to kind of help
[6466.00 --> 6470.08]  ease it is i was like okay i told myself before i came here that i wasn't going to buy a bunch of
[6470.08 --> 6475.12]  this stuff because i i i love this stuff too and i was like nope nope nope nope i'm not doing this
[6475.12 --> 6478.96]  no matter how convenient it is that he already has like pre-modded consoles and like all kinds of
[6478.96 --> 6486.48]  things that i would love to collect um but what i told him is that if i buy anything i will buy it for
[6486.48 --> 6493.12]  um i think it was either it was either 2x or 3x like sticker so there were two things i bought
[6493.12 --> 6499.60]  i bought a copy of final fantasy tactics for the playstation one that's cool which i should have
[6499.60 --> 6505.92]  done ages ago i have played through that game part way at least half a dozen times and i've played
[6505.92 --> 6510.72]  through it all the way twice yeah not not only is that a cool game that he'll almost certainly play
[6510.72 --> 6514.96]  but it's also cool because you've talked about it like forever and i have never bought that game
[6514.96 --> 6524.48]  yeah and that is even by my own sort of you know piracy ethics code not okay i needed to buy a copy
[6524.48 --> 6528.96]  of that game at some point by the time i played it it had been out of print anyway like there was no
[6528.96 --> 6535.04]  there was no time at which uh square soft i don't think they were square enix yet i would have gotten
[6535.04 --> 6541.04]  any money from me for it and me buying this used copy doesn't give them any money in any way um but at
[6541.04 --> 6546.72]  least i own a physical copy of the game i have definitely owned it now um so i bought that
[6547.52 --> 6551.36]  and i bought a snes controller and i told him it's because i'm sure luke is never giving me mine back
[6552.96 --> 6558.08]  i will sure well in case you don't i still have two now
[6562.32 --> 6567.28]  that was a really long story really boring my apologies we got precision screwdriver costs
[6567.28 --> 6574.32]  oh do we okay what is it i'm surprised i want i want you to read it to make sure that it's right
[6574.32 --> 6579.36]  well where do i read it uh it's under the how is the ltt screwdriver holding up section of the document
[6579.36 --> 6587.36]  oh okay uh but i can't do that no no i got it i got it i got it wait i don't got it where is it i don't
[6587.36 --> 6596.72]  even see it under the oh sorry under the title of it oh is it really that i don't know i told what
[6596.72 --> 6601.76]  part of i don't okay my kids do this all the time they'll say where's mom and i'll say i don't know
[6601.76 --> 6609.28]  and they'll say is she upstairs i'll be like what i just tell you well no here here i'm asking for bs
[6609.28 --> 6618.08]  detector already sent me a screenshot from something that nick light said okay cool okay it's 29.99 so
[6618.08 --> 6623.36]  then it's what was it four dollars and 80 cents off something like that yeah okay so it's going to be
[6623.36 --> 6625.36]  25 bucks for the first hundred nice
[6631.52 --> 6636.56]  really does that seem right that's what i was saying it's like all metal machine and stuff that's
[6636.56 --> 6641.12]  what i was saying went with the expensive bearing and everything we haven't even talked about some
[6641.12 --> 6647.04]  of the key benefits of it um this is a really cool product and it's it's little things like just like
[6647.04 --> 6651.84]  everyone in front of the chat it's like you can't take it back like just like with the screwdriver you guys
[6652.08 --> 6659.92]  um it's not like we invented screwdrivers it's not like we invented ratcheting screwdrivers it's not
[6659.92 --> 6666.08]  like we invented ratcheting screwdrivers with bit storage in the handle like but that doesn't
[6666.08 --> 6672.64]  change the fact that a product can be much greater than the sum of its parts and i think we're up in
[6672.64 --> 6680.56]  the neighborhood of around 150 000 screwdrivers now like absolutely colossal numbers i'm probably i'm
[6680.56 --> 6685.12]  probably underestimating i'm making sure that the number that i say is is what we've sold and the
[6685.12 --> 6691.52]  reason for that is not because people just are suckers and fall for influencers or whatever the case
[6691.52 --> 6695.76]  may be it's because it's a really good screwdriver it's greater than the sum of its parts it's
[6695.76 --> 6700.08]  well balanced it feels good in the hand it's durable uh people absolutely love it in fact we've
[6700.08 --> 6707.28]  got a whole topic um based on uh people on reddit just posting how much they love their screwdrivers
[6707.28 --> 6712.08]  i'm a technician at a science museum i use the something out of it cool people are showing this
[6712.08 --> 6719.84]  thing being absolutely beat up to heck and back like you can tell this one is shiny this one is glossy
[6719.84 --> 6727.28]  uh from use uh okay it's a beater screwdriver i do other percussive maintenance anyway the point is
[6727.28 --> 6733.44]  people absolutely love this product and it's because we care so much about little fine details and
[6734.40 --> 6741.52]  on this one one of the big ones and it's really hard to tell from here but our precision bits are about
[6741.52 --> 6750.56]  the same length as you would find in the industry standard but the actual shank is much longer and
[6750.56 --> 6756.96]  hex is much shorter and if you've ever used a precision kit then you guys will probably know
[6756.96 --> 6763.36]  that occasionally they don't reach deep enough and it's pretty friggin annoying and uh we felt the same
[6763.36 --> 6770.08]  way so we designed our precision bits to reach just a little bit deeper we couldn't go too long on them
[6770.08 --> 6773.68]  if someone asks if we can travel with these well if you can travel with another one you can travel
[6773.68 --> 6780.40]  with this one because they're exactly the same length as other people's bits but the usable depth
[6780.40 --> 6787.52]  on the skinny shank ones is significantly greater um and we couldn't go a ton longer because there's
[6787.52 --> 6792.32]  going to be durability concerns for some of the really small ones like it is not a substitute for
[6792.32 --> 6800.96]  just like a long shaft fixed um like a fixed bit screwdriver um and as you go like as you go really
[6800.96 --> 6805.12]  long there'll be too much wobble and stuff like that like there's other design concerns but we've got
[6805.12 --> 6811.68]  a super strong magnet we've got this longer shank and i think you're going to find that the day-to-day usability
[6812.32 --> 6820.00]  is noticeably greater so yeah just just really excited about uh just really excited about this product and
[6820.00 --> 6825.60]  yeah pricing downright reasonable i i legitimately just didn't know what the pricing was going to be
[6825.60 --> 6830.00]  that doesn't mean nobody ever talked to me about it at some point i probably told me it's not top of
[6830.00 --> 6837.20]  mind yeah just it's just been a while yeah yeah finally freaking finally i feel like this thing's been
[6837.76 --> 6843.84]  basically ready for so long and then it is freaking finally actually ready was it manufacturing stuff that
[6843.84 --> 6849.52]  held it off because i feel like it was everything yeah i mean i told the story recently about how it turns out
[6850.00 --> 6857.68]  that the uh the measurements of these small bits are not industry standard so the standard i
[6858.24 --> 6868.40]  tynan or kyle would remember the standard is to have it be the right measurement on no on the bit side
[6868.40 --> 6873.68]  and then have the tolerance on the screwdriver side but everyone else has the right measurement on the
[6873.68 --> 6878.32]  screwdriver side and then the bits are smaller to account for tolerance or something like that so we had
[6878.32 --> 6883.04]  done it the right way but it turns out everybody else does it the other way and so there was a risk
[6883.52 --> 6892.08]  that our standard sized bits with their tolerances would occasionally be too big for other people's uh
[6892.08 --> 6897.20]  precision screwdriver and we're like okay well people might want our bits they might buy our bits
[6897.20 --> 6902.32]  to put in their existing kit because of the longer the longer shafts and they might discover that like
[6902.32 --> 6905.76]  they don't fit or something like that so we didn't want to deal with that fair enough so we had to
[6905.76 --> 6912.96]  like redo it anyway uh are we going to switch to after dark because i think we're pretty close we're
[6912.96 --> 6915.68]  out of topics out of topics okay after dark it is
[6919.20 --> 6922.24]  it's no longer dark we just changed the yeah we just changed the logo now
[6922.24 --> 6929.60]  people didn't like the that we were sitting in the dark on lmg clips which makes sense which makes
[6929.60 --> 6934.64]  sense when you take it out of the context of the show it's yeah it's kind of stupid yeah i get it
[6934.64 --> 6941.60]  i get it you guys are we do this now yeah yeah that sounds like a you know dark kind of works
[6941.60 --> 6948.08]  dark purple yeah oh it's a light purple ghost type mid purple ghost type thanks for that
[6952.72 --> 6960.00]  uh okay i got some brad purple brad purple no brad's green you haven't even listened to it i don't
[6960.00 --> 6968.56]  know suck not brad no not at all not brad uh okay i got some uh merch messages here let's see uh
[6968.56 --> 6973.28]  question for linus do you still frequent beat saber which platform have you settled on watching
[6973.28 --> 6978.96]  on a quest 3. i haven't been playing much lately because the majority of my exercise has been
[6978.96 --> 6985.36]  swimming lately although yvonne did beat saber for her for her cardio last night and we are still on pc
[6985.36 --> 6994.64]  i'm still on the valve index it's just it's the best overall package the big screen beyond is super cool
[6994.64 --> 7000.80]  and there's lots of other really cool headsets from the lake of varjo or vario or however you
[7000.80 --> 7007.20]  pronounce that uh the quest 3 is super affordable and practical but i already have an index it's a
[7007.20 --> 7012.64]  little frustrating that that is true and the index released in 2019 yeah but it's it's outside in
[7012.64 --> 7019.28]  tracking it's which still the screen is good enough it's the past dude the near field speakers on it
[7019.28 --> 7025.12]  really good they freaking crush yeah they're outstanding like what am i going to do i'm going
[7025.12 --> 7031.84]  to like apple vision like what am i supposed to upgrade to dude at this point i would buy like a
[7031.84 --> 7038.24]  screen upgrade for my index yeah over a lot of the other options that are out there so i just sweet
[7038.24 --> 7040.48]  i just keep ending up back at the index
[7043.36 --> 7049.12]  index is based i hope deckard gets news says katos i heard deckard is supposed to be inside out though i'm not
[7049.12 --> 7055.28]  interested in wearing a phone on my face yeah i just want an index with a better screen that in the
[7055.28 --> 7060.08]  index comfort is so good like it's just it's just it's a great package
[7063.44 --> 7071.20]  hi wanda dl just built first pc with me and my brother it's a sick basement gaming rig
[7071.76 --> 7078.24]  what was the first pc that you built what os did it run mine runs fedora 40 love the new scrapyard wars
[7079.92 --> 7089.60]  first pc i ever built ran windows xp uh it was an athlon 2500 plus barton core i overclocked it to
[7089.60 --> 7095.36]  the same clock speed as a 3200 plus which i believe was 2.2 gigahertz or like 2.2.3 something
[7096.24 --> 7104.08]  i had 512 megs that's right megs of ddr1 memory running in single channel
[7104.08 --> 7112.08]  um because i you know thought i might expand later i had a 120 uh gigabyte which was very common back
[7112.08 --> 7125.04]  then 120 gigabyte uh sata drive i i spent wow uh yeah i spent um less on the i got i got less cash i got
[7125.04 --> 7131.84]  the two meg cash 120 gig one instead of the eight meg cash 80 gig one i wanted more capacity versus more
[7131.84 --> 7139.60]  cash i wasn't convinced that cash made that big of a difference i had a soltech mrn l motherboard uh
[7139.60 --> 7149.52]  n force n force 4 chipset um i had an antech lanboy which had a smart blue 350 watt power supply and then
[7149.52 --> 7155.60]  i reused my old peripheral so i had an old crt from my uncle's old computer which was unironically fine
[7155.60 --> 7163.44]  um and then uh microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard and just like a generic i probably had a ball mouse
[7163.44 --> 7167.68]  at the beginning i don't even know if i had like a generic laser mouse yet but at some point i got
[7167.68 --> 7175.84]  like a generic logitech laser mouse and then i used a piece of a4 paper as a mouse pad for actually i i
[7175.84 --> 7179.76]  went through some upgrades to everything else before i ditched the a4 paper mouse pad
[7179.76 --> 7187.92]  my my first pc was my first pc that i built myself was windows xp i had built stuff with my dad that
[7187.92 --> 7193.28]  was earlier than that but realistically how much of that was my own doing is probably very small
[7193.84 --> 7198.32]  like my dad was doing basically everything at that point and if you're asking what gpu did i have
[7198.88 --> 7207.84]  i didn't that's why i got the mrn l because it had on board geforce graphics which spoiler alert remember
[7207.84 --> 7213.28]  when i talked earlier about how nvidia bamboozled me once before i was very knowledgeable with their
[7213.28 --> 7221.20]  misleading naming geforce 4 mx was a lot closer architecturally to geforce 2 than it was to geforce
[7221.20 --> 7228.56]  4. it wasn't even direct x8 if i recall correctly really yeah so that was when they got me i spent
[7228.56 --> 7233.12]  extra on this motherboard that i thought had like i heard geforce 4 was good i didn't know anything yet
[7234.16 --> 7237.68]  so i got this on board graphics that i thought was like you know yeah it's on board but it's
[7237.68 --> 7244.16]  like good it's like good on board it's geforce i didn't know i didn't know it sucked yeah that
[7244.16 --> 7253.12]  branding was frustrating i remember that at the time yep hey linus i'm the head lifeguard at my pool
[7253.12 --> 7258.80]  and my manager has been pushing me to do more desk work how did you handle the similar change in your
[7258.80 --> 7267.28]  life as lmg grew wish there was more space for nuan i guess nuance i don't know i don't know it's some
[7267.28 --> 7275.04]  days i i like and appreciate you know having a greater impact through you know team building and
[7275.04 --> 7279.76]  um you know and all working together like that sense of group accomplishment like that's really
[7279.76 --> 7283.84]  good you got to kind of learn to enjoy that as well but there's days that i really i don't even have
[7283.84 --> 7290.96]  a test bench in my office anymore yeah like that sucks i like tinkering with things you know um that's
[7290.96 --> 7296.00]  way more fun for me like i'll get i'll get caught up on set sometimes they'll be like telling me okay
[7296.00 --> 7299.84]  yeah you got to stop like troubleshooting this and go to another shoot let someone else fix it i'm like
[7299.84 --> 7306.80]  yeah but that's lame like i want to fix it um and i i don't know i i think as a as a tinkerer i've
[7306.80 --> 7318.96]  i've never really gotten over that hey all i am a truck driver working on transitioning to tech i used
[7318.96 --> 7327.92]  to run ha in a vm my main gaming pc the riot games anti-cheat would freeze my pc any thoughts on anti-cheat
[7327.92 --> 7336.24]  breaking things when you say ha do you mean home assistant i'm assuming so i i don't know um yeah man i
[7336.88 --> 7341.12]  i am so i was thinking about this the other day oh yeah i remember i think it was you who flagged
[7341.12 --> 7347.44]  some someone uploaded some toolkit or something that had a gaming pc in it on reddit i thought i
[7347.44 --> 7352.32]  thought you showed it to me yeah and uh you and someone else were both like yeah we should totally
[7352.32 --> 7357.12]  do like like seven gamers one cpu again mobile but like a mobile one yeah yeah the problem is that it
[7357.12 --> 7363.36]  doesn't work the compatibility would be basically as bad as like a steam deck or like a snapdragon
[7363.36 --> 7368.16]  because anything with anti-cheat just immediately craps out when you're using virtualization
[7368.16 --> 7373.84]  land rig so who cares just play old games can you play halo ce yeah but if you're gonna play hell
[7373.84 --> 7379.92]  yeah if you're gonna play old games why don't you just ah man i don't know why are you gonna build
[7379.92 --> 7386.00]  like a cutting edge amd epic like server thing with a bunch of modern gpus in it to play halo combat
[7386.00 --> 7393.52]  evolved left for dead to halo ce maybe some rocket league sprinkled in there yeah but you could play
[7393.52 --> 7397.84]  that on a bunch of laptops like that's my that's my point who cares what do you mean it's still fun
[7397.84 --> 7403.44]  the gaming is the fun yeah building the computer is the fun though i don't know i'm just i'm just over
[7403.44 --> 7410.24]  it now that anti-cheat just locks you out of any modern game as soon as it detects a vm i just i
[7410.24 --> 7417.04]  think it's i think it's dead and i've had this debate with the um the guy that used to be at unraid
[7417.04 --> 7421.76]  and is now at eshtec who is like really passionate about that stuff and really helped us get seven
[7421.76 --> 7427.76]  gamers one cpu over the line um his new project which investment disclosure i invested in because i think
[7427.76 --> 7435.12]  he's a cool guy and his team's cool um no offense john not because i haven't necessarily a ton of
[7435.12 --> 7443.12]  confidence but yeah um the point is that uh i've i've debated with him and i've just been like dude
[7443.12 --> 7447.36]  i think it's dead he's still really like passionate about virtualization and that kind of a use case
[7447.36 --> 7456.72]  and like dude it's over um if you're you know take the money do whatever you want but please don't do
[7456.72 --> 7460.80]  that it's i mean it's over for competitive games with anti-cheat but there is a lot of games out
[7460.80 --> 7466.64]  there that don't have that yeah there are but there aren't a lot of high-end games in general right now
[7467.36 --> 7471.12]  and most of them like you're talking about actually having a need for the hardware most
[7471.12 --> 7476.72]  these competitive games that you're talking about um won't push it anyways sure but the one that killed
[7476.72 --> 7481.84]  it for me was we were going to do the land center at home with that we were going to do a like a five
[7481.84 --> 7487.36]  gamers one cpu setup and then jake and i set it up to do the proof of concept video and we tried to
[7487.36 --> 7494.24]  launch halo infinite and we couldn't play it like oh there there is definitely games i'm just saying
[7494.24 --> 7498.32]  like there's a there's a lot of stuff that it wouldn't necessarily apply to there is also a lot
[7498.32 --> 7504.72]  of stuff that it would apply yeah and and the last thing that i want to do is you know just
[7504.72 --> 7513.84]  just it's hard enough to all agree on a game and get it working adding virtualization and potential
[7513.84 --> 7522.08]  conflicts with anti-cheat doesn't make it better tape to tape got an update i know the ai's goalies
[7522.08 --> 7528.56]  manual goalies and the ai's way better manual goalies brother guess what our squad got an update
[7528.56 --> 7536.24]  oh yeah cullen plays dude he's like yeah i heard you guys talking about it and stuff but i like
[7536.24 --> 7541.68]  never mentioned it let's go i was like dude it's like the only game i play right why do you say
[7541.68 --> 7545.44]  our biggest problem he's like yeah i've been playing a ton of tape today we have constantly rotating
[7545.44 --> 7555.44]  players that's honestly a huge problem so so we so squad squad now you me elijah yvonne we've got chase
[7555.44 --> 7561.84]  in the squad uh david plays oh he's probably killer at it he's good at like video games he like
[7561.84 --> 7569.52]  well yeah he's like sweaty as all hell good and also like played hockey for years uh and then and
[7569.52 --> 7574.16]  and now we've got colin so we've got like we've got like seven people that we can draw from when
[7574.16 --> 7580.40]  we want to do a run now hell yeah that's actually exciting did i miss anybody that would be super
[7580.40 --> 7586.40]  embarrassing if i missed anybody there's other people that um wasn't it angus got pretty good
[7586.40 --> 7592.00]  there angus got pretty good at the land yeah there's other people that have kind of dropped in here
[7592.00 --> 7598.56]  or there but i don't think they like would practice yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah colin like plays like he
[7598.56 --> 7604.80]  almost beat me nice yeah good and he he might have we need that the game got interrupted because he was
[7604.80 --> 7610.96]  running some kind of like weird music production software and it like ripped the audio device away
[7610.96 --> 7616.08]  from the game we think i think it caused a crash yeah um so that the crash will probably get cut from
[7616.08 --> 7619.52]  the amd ultimate tech upgrade just because we're worried people will get confused and think it was
[7619.52 --> 7626.24]  because of amd or something it's not right um but it was actually because um i forget what the tools
[7626.24 --> 7631.04]  caused called but it like that tool had an error to do with the audio device like right when the game
[7631.04 --> 7636.16]  crashed on the other screen so we're pretty sure it was because of that yeah yeah anyway tape to tape
[7636.16 --> 7642.32]  let's go last one i've got for you here can't wait to get that backpack question for linus has anyone
[7642.32 --> 7652.40]  failed to recognize you now that you are blonde ish uh man i can be wearing sunglasses and like a hood
[7653.20 --> 7657.52]  and people will stop me in the street i don't think i don't think they need the hair color i don't
[7657.52 --> 7665.12]  know what it is i don't know i don't know what makes me so what we met we met last weekend uh
[7665.92 --> 7669.12]  impromptu just walking past each other in a parking lot and he thought i was a fan
[7672.08 --> 7675.84]  okay oh no ow
[7677.68 --> 7684.96]  you deserve it yeah how can you tell that story what's wrong with you it was really that's not even
[7684.96 --> 7689.84]  related to what they were saying they were asking how recognizable i was it was genuinely really
[7689.84 --> 7699.68]  funny that's horrible i got double takes so hard oh my god look look i have talked about this on the
[7699.68 --> 7708.48]  show before i have a really hard time recognizing people out of context i'm really bad with faces i'm
[7708.48 --> 7714.08]  bad with names i'm especially bad with faces and i'm especially bad when i see them out of context
[7714.64 --> 7719.92]  i wasn't expecting to see luke just walking out of a restaurant i was heading into and when i see
[7719.92 --> 7726.40]  someone wearing an ltt shirt i looked at the shirt first when i see someone wearing a shirt it's not a
[7726.40 --> 7732.64]  completely crazy thing for me to assume that they're a viewer and they're just like waving at me and
[7732.64 --> 7740.72]  so when luke just randomly waved at me and was like hey linus i saw the shirt and i was like hey
[7741.60 --> 7747.92]  it was pretty quick it was a pretty quick double and i had to i i didn't realize it was him at first
[7748.96 --> 7756.96]  i figured it out pretty fast yes yeah i recognized emma yeah but yes i did not recognize
[7756.96 --> 7767.36]  luke yeah oh why do you get it man it was funny to be fair i had a similar type reaction i just saw
[7767.36 --> 7771.84]  you first so i had enough time to like process it before i actually said anything because what was
[7771.84 --> 7777.92]  confusing for me was that i saw you and i saw all the kids um but yvonne wasn't there and my brain
[7777.92 --> 7784.80]  didn't like immediately click in because like your hair i had sort of forgot i had just done it but i'd like
[7784.80 --> 7790.96]  forgot yeah so i was like what like we also had a kid that wasn't one of ours so yeah that probably
[7790.96 --> 7796.48]  was a factor there yeah it was a little odd which does it make me feel i don't care at all it's not
[7796.48 --> 7804.16]  just like a youtuber thing that we it was legit thanks for watching see you again next time same bad
[7804.16 --> 7814.16]  time same bad channel
[7816.48 --> 7818.16]  i have destroyed him
[7826.00 --> 7832.16]  oh my god
[7834.16 --> 7842.00]  it
[7844.32 --> 7844.64]  uh
[7844.64 --> 7846.40]  it
[7846.40 --> 7846.80]  uh
[7846.80 --> 7847.76]  it
[7847.76 --> 7847.94]  you
[7847.94 --> 7848.72]  it
[7848.72 --> 7851.12]  it
[7851.12 --> 7851.98]  it
[7851.98 --> 7852.32]  it
[7852.32 --> 7852.66]  it
[7852.66 --> 7853.18]  it
[7853.26 --> 7854.78]  it
