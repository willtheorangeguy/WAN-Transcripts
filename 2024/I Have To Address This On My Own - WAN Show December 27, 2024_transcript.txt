[0.00 --> 0.74]  WAN show.
[0.84 --> 1.04]  Hello.
[1.26 --> 3.56]  A bit of a downer week this week.
[4.22 --> 8.10]  Gordon Ma, legendary PC hardware journalist,
[8.64 --> 10.38]  has, excuse me, Gordon Ma Ung,
[11.48 --> 14.46]  has passed away at 58.
[16.28 --> 18.74]  So we'll be talking a little bit about that.
[19.06 --> 21.20]  His family's got to go fund me because, you know,
[22.88 --> 26.88]  late stage healthcare in America can be real challenging.
[26.88 --> 27.26]  Yeah.
[27.26 --> 30.40]  So that's a real downer.
[30.76 --> 34.04]  We'll also be talking about the Honey controversy
[34.04 --> 35.52]  that broke this week.
[35.90 --> 39.64]  Turns out Honey has been doing some stuff that is not sweet.
[40.14 --> 41.22]  What else we got this week?
[41.40 --> 43.20]  We're going to talk about Linus on Colin and Samir,
[43.42 --> 46.64]  and we're going to talk about a favorite moments of 2024.
[47.20 --> 47.50]  Oh.
[48.04 --> 50.30]  Well, that sounds at least good.
[50.68 --> 50.96]  Yeah.
[57.26 --> 79.38]  Oh, the show is brought to you by JumpFound, MSI, and, uh-oh, sorry,
[79.38 --> 82.72]  I got totally bamboozled by myself.
[82.92 --> 83.70]  Boot.dev.
[83.78 --> 84.96]  Boot.dev, right.
[85.12 --> 88.20]  And, of course, it's brought to you by our chair partner, Secret Lab,
[88.66 --> 92.08]  our skin partner, Dbrand, and our laptop partner, LG.
[92.78 --> 96.56]  So why don't we jump right into Mr. Gordon?
[96.56 --> 100.30]  Unfortunately, I suck at professional networking,
[100.30 --> 104.62]  and while I did have the privilege of meeting Gordon on a number of occasions,
[104.62 --> 106.56]  we weren't particularly close.
[106.96 --> 109.54]  But it's a funny thing because, you know,
[109.60 --> 113.56]  just like anyone else that I kind of cut my teeth...
[114.28 --> 115.92]  Go away, phone.
[116.08 --> 116.98]  It's buzzing in the mic.
[117.18 --> 119.98]  Anyone else that I kind of cut my tech teeth reading,
[119.98 --> 124.98]  you know, the Ryan Shrouts and the Anand Lalshimpis of the world,
[126.14 --> 129.96]  you know, Gordon means more to me than I probably did to him.
[130.22 --> 130.48]  Right.
[131.06 --> 131.46]  Yeah.
[131.72 --> 132.06]  You know?
[132.16 --> 132.48]  Yeah, yeah.
[132.52 --> 135.24]  Like, we did a video a little while ago
[135.24 --> 139.98]  building a Maximum PC, Dream PC, from when I was in high school.
[140.20 --> 143.80]  Like, that was Gordon's jam, right?
[143.80 --> 144.90]  I used to read those, yeah.
[144.90 --> 149.56]  Yeah, so I'm going to read the thing that our team prepared,
[149.88 --> 151.48]  just because that makes it a little bit easier.
[152.16 --> 155.82]  Gordon Maung, executive editor of PC World, passed away at 58,
[156.42 --> 158.98]  which, sorry, I'm already going off script.
[159.98 --> 161.02]  Seriously, 58.
[161.40 --> 168.08]  Like, 58 is the new 48, honestly, and it seems way too soon.
[168.08 --> 168.40]  Yeah.
[168.70 --> 173.90]  After a battle with pancreatic cancer, insert obligatory cancer,
[173.90 --> 175.54]  I don't care how early it is in the video.
[175.70 --> 178.62]  Apparently, beeping too early in the video is bad for the algorithm,
[178.82 --> 180.56]  but I think we can make an exception here.
[181.20 --> 182.98]  A pioneering figure in tech journalism,
[183.22 --> 185.06]  Gordon had over 25 years of experience,
[185.20 --> 188.06]  particularly in covering computer hardware and chips.
[188.30 --> 189.82]  He was known for his investigative rigor,
[190.30 --> 192.02]  sharp wit, and strong personality,
[192.02 --> 194.34]  which resonated with both his colleagues and the tech community.
[194.84 --> 197.80]  Gordon's career began in journalism as a police reporter
[197.80 --> 199.68]  for the Contra Costa Times.
[200.14 --> 203.02]  In 1997, he would join Computer World and later Maximum PC,
[203.02 --> 204.74]  where he became famous for his passionate,
[204.98 --> 207.66]  often humorous commentary and deep technical expertise.
[208.18 --> 211.40]  He was the driving force behind Maximum PC's Dream Machine project
[211.40 --> 213.72]  and its consumer advocacy column, Watchdog.
[214.40 --> 215.86]  Later, Gordon joined PC World,
[215.94 --> 218.16]  where he continued his in-depth coverage of PC hardware.
[218.74 --> 221.50]  He began his foray into video with Hardcore Hardware Series
[221.50 --> 223.04]  and the Full Nerd Podcast.
[223.72 --> 227.98]  He was actually shockingly good on camera
[227.98 --> 230.80]  for one of the traditional, like, written people.
[230.80 --> 232.38]  Like, he, I can't...
[232.38 --> 232.82]  That was not a given.
[233.04 --> 233.60]  I can't...
[233.60 --> 235.94]  No, it was not a given.
[236.10 --> 238.70]  Like, multi-talented guy.
[238.80 --> 242.92]  It's very few people that made that switch,
[242.92 --> 246.62]  but he seemed as natural on camera as he was on a written page,
[246.66 --> 250.00]  which is pretty incredible.
[251.28 --> 252.56]  Parkey in the chat says,
[252.64 --> 253.26]  never heard of him.
[253.34 --> 254.30]  I guess I'm too Zoomer.
[254.30 --> 258.34]  I promise you that you've read something Gordon wrote.
[258.64 --> 261.50]  Or read something influenced by Gordon.
[261.70 --> 263.10]  I promise you.
[263.52 --> 265.30]  And the reason for that is that
[265.88 --> 271.24]  so many of the formats,
[271.48 --> 276.40]  so many of the styles that were started
[276.40 --> 278.32]  while he was there
[278.32 --> 280.40]  have become just commonplace.
[280.40 --> 281.44]  It's kind of like saying,
[281.58 --> 284.04]  yeah, I've never...
[284.04 --> 285.98]  Oh, man, I'm trying to think of, like,
[286.10 --> 290.50]  a really, like, a trend-setting movie or show
[290.50 --> 291.28]  or something like that.
[291.32 --> 291.74]  It's okay.
[291.94 --> 292.84]  It's like saying,
[292.96 --> 294.84]  yeah, I've never seen a bit from I Love Lucy.
[295.30 --> 296.18]  It's like, you have.
[296.58 --> 297.82]  You just don't know it
[297.82 --> 300.66]  because all the characters were recast
[300.66 --> 302.90]  and the script was retooled slightly.
[304.28 --> 306.64]  But, like, Lucille Ball was a trendsetter.
[306.94 --> 307.06]  Yeah.
[307.06 --> 311.06]  But, um, anyway...
[311.64 --> 313.74]  Gordon's work and legacy in the tech journalism space,
[313.96 --> 315.80]  marked by both his technical know-how
[315.80 --> 317.08]  and larger-than-life persona,
[317.18 --> 319.02]  earned him widespread respect and admiration,
[319.18 --> 319.72]  can confirm.
[320.16 --> 322.22]  Gordon was committed until the very end,
[322.60 --> 323.88]  publishing video hardware reviews
[323.88 --> 325.88]  as recently as November 6th
[325.88 --> 327.22]  during the end of his treatment.
[328.20 --> 328.48]  Wow.
[329.92 --> 331.56]  I give you my personal
[331.56 --> 334.62]  Linus Sebastian promise
[334.62 --> 337.92]  that I will not be working
[337.92 --> 340.52]  up until a couple of months
[340.52 --> 341.36]  before my passing.
[343.36 --> 346.28]  If I find out that I have a serious illness,
[346.58 --> 349.46]  I will peace so fast
[349.46 --> 351.48]  that you guys won't even remember
[351.48 --> 352.38]  I was ever here.
[353.20 --> 353.84]  Um,
[354.36 --> 357.84]  that is an unbelievable
[357.84 --> 359.66]  level of commitment
[359.66 --> 360.88]  and, uh,
[360.88 --> 361.56]  and actually
[361.56 --> 363.54]  super admirable
[363.54 --> 364.54]  because you have to,
[364.70 --> 365.58]  you have to know
[365.58 --> 366.90]  that anyone who,
[367.20 --> 367.48]  you know,
[367.52 --> 368.40]  stays at it
[368.40 --> 369.22]  is
[369.22 --> 370.52]  fighting hard.
[370.66 --> 371.26]  Oh, yeah.
[371.34 --> 371.58]  You know,
[371.72 --> 372.74]  having that, uh,
[372.74 --> 373.60]  having that confidence
[373.60 --> 374.72]  that
[374.72 --> 376.36]  things are going to be normal someday.
[376.74 --> 377.02]  Um,
[377.42 --> 378.62]  and just pushing for his family,
[378.68 --> 378.96]  I'm sure.
[379.24 --> 379.52]  Yeah,
[379.52 --> 380.38]  if you'd like to hear more
[380.38 --> 380.80]  about,
[380.94 --> 381.56]  about Gordon,
[381.78 --> 382.26]  um,
[382.50 --> 383.06]  there's
[383.06 --> 384.04]  pages,
[384.20 --> 385.04]  there's a page full
[385.04 --> 385.94]  of heartfelt tributes
[385.94 --> 386.56]  on PC World
[386.56 --> 387.70]  as well as lovely videos
[387.70 --> 388.78]  from Tech Tech Potato,
[389.06 --> 389.34]  aka,
[389.90 --> 390.08]  uh,
[390.08 --> 390.84]  Dr. Ian Cutras,
[391.04 --> 392.06]  who is one of the,
[392.12 --> 392.68]  one of the folks
[392.68 --> 394.12]  that I grew up reading
[394.12 --> 394.98]  a lot as well,
[395.06 --> 395.64]  uh,
[395.64 --> 396.56]  as well as Gamers Nexus.
[397.74 --> 398.16]  Um,
[399.16 --> 404.30]  there's a whole bunch
[404.30 --> 407.06]  of discussion topics here,
[407.06 --> 409.26]  but I think that,
[409.26 --> 409.76]  um,
[410.48 --> 411.46]  the best thing
[411.46 --> 412.64]  to do right now,
[413.10 --> 413.34]  uh,
[413.34 --> 413.64]  Dan,
[413.70 --> 414.36]  can you go ahead
[414.36 --> 415.56]  and get the GoFundMe
[415.56 --> 416.98]  linked in the,
[417.12 --> 417.78]  uh,
[417.80 --> 418.32]  in the chat.
[418.78 --> 419.18]  Uh,
[419.18 --> 420.46]  let's just hurry up.
[420.50 --> 420.90]  I'm just,
[421.08 --> 421.86]  I'm just looking at this
[421.86 --> 422.42]  for the first time.
[422.46 --> 423.66]  This is actually incredible.
[424.02 --> 424.42]  Uh,
[424.46 --> 425.50]  massive shout out
[425.50 --> 426.12]  to the community
[426.12 --> 427.56]  for stepping up here.
[428.24 --> 428.68]  Um,
[428.92 --> 429.70]  why don't we just
[429.70 --> 430.58]  finish it off,
[430.86 --> 431.94]  but there's no reason
[431.94 --> 432.90]  that you can't
[432.90 --> 433.60]  exceed a goal.
[434.22 --> 434.44]  So,
[434.44 --> 434.88]  um,
[434.98 --> 435.22]  Dan,
[435.28 --> 436.06]  can I just give you
[436.06 --> 436.90]  the company card
[436.90 --> 438.06]  and can you do that
[438.06 --> 438.54]  off camera?
[438.78 --> 439.14]  Absolutely.
[439.40 --> 439.62]  Okay,
[439.66 --> 440.06]  thank you.
[440.76 --> 441.24]  Uh,
[441.56 --> 443.40]  it's the one
[443.40 --> 444.24]  that I am kind of
[444.24 --> 445.24]  pulling out here.
[445.92 --> 446.08]  Uh,
[446.10 --> 446.24]  no,
[446.30 --> 447.48]  that's this one.
[449.44 --> 449.88]  Um,
[451.00 --> 451.70]  I don't know.
[451.76 --> 452.84]  You'll find it.
[454.12 --> 454.60]  Thanks,
[454.70 --> 454.84]  Dan.
[456.58 --> 457.02]  Um,
[457.66 --> 457.90]  whoa,
[458.02 --> 458.80]  AC3 production
[458.80 --> 460.16]  says Falcon Northwest,
[460.64 --> 461.30]  uh,
[461.34 --> 462.88]  donated 25,000.
[462.92 --> 463.14]  They did.
[463.66 --> 464.54]  Massive shout out,
[464.60 --> 464.76]  Kel.
[464.86 --> 465.84]  What an absolute,
[465.84 --> 466.38]  early on too.
[466.64 --> 467.48]  What an absolute
[467.48 --> 468.64]  Chad.
[469.34 --> 469.74]  Um,
[470.34 --> 471.36]  Kel's super cool.
[471.58 --> 472.54]  He's the kind of person
[472.54 --> 472.90]  who,
[473.38 --> 474.60]  as far as I can tell,
[474.70 --> 476.02]  doesn't really need to,
[476.24 --> 477.42]  um,
[478.12 --> 480.30]  doesn't really need to,
[480.40 --> 480.68]  like,
[482.00 --> 483.46]  oh,
[483.56 --> 483.76]  sorry.
[484.10 --> 484.26]  Oh,
[484.28 --> 484.42]  yeah,
[484.50 --> 484.64]  yeah,
[484.64 --> 485.36]  go ahead and use that one.
[485.40 --> 485.68]  That's fine.
[485.74 --> 485.92]  Thanks,
[485.98 --> 486.10]  Dan.
[486.62 --> 486.98]  Um,
[487.06 --> 487.76]  Kel's the kind of person
[487.76 --> 487.90]  that,
[487.98 --> 488.60]  as far as I can tell,
[488.64 --> 489.28]  doesn't really need to,
[489.36 --> 489.40]  like,
[489.42 --> 490.48]  build gaming systems anymore
[490.48 --> 491.46]  if he doesn't really feel
[491.46 --> 491.82]  like it.
[492.24 --> 492.64]  Um,
[492.64 --> 493.78]  I wish I'd gotten to,
[493.90 --> 494.74]  I wish I'd gotten to know
[494.74 --> 495.22]  Gordon better.
[495.38 --> 495.54]  I,
[495.74 --> 496.54]  I am,
[496.68 --> 497.10]  like I said,
[497.14 --> 498.18]  I'm terrible at networking
[498.18 --> 500.40]  and I have a tendency
[500.40 --> 502.64]  to just go to trade shows
[502.64 --> 503.12]  and stuff
[503.12 --> 504.24]  and just go completely
[504.24 --> 505.36]  head down in my work
[505.36 --> 506.28]  and it's stuff like this
[506.28 --> 506.64]  that,
[506.64 --> 507.68]  um,
[507.68 --> 508.98]  makes me kind of regret that.
[509.24 --> 509.56]  Um,
[510.96 --> 511.22]  yeah.
[511.98 --> 512.90]  Did you get a chance
[512.90 --> 513.58]  to meet him at least?
[514.02 --> 514.80]  I met him twice.
[515.04 --> 515.26]  Yeah,
[515.30 --> 515.52]  okay.
[517.46 --> 517.90]  Uh,
[517.90 --> 518.08]  just,
[518.18 --> 518.96]  just finish it off.
[519.10 --> 519.76]  They have a goal.
[520.10 --> 520.44]  Um,
[520.56 --> 521.44]  let's just make sure
[521.44 --> 522.18]  they hit it.
[524.30 --> 524.70]  Um,
[525.10 --> 525.70]  yeah,
[528.18 --> 528.78]  yeah.
[530.34 --> 530.78]  Yeah.
[535.82 --> 536.48]  All right.
[536.68 --> 537.00]  Well,
[537.20 --> 537.94]  on that note,
[538.04 --> 538.36]  uh,
[538.36 --> 538.96]  why don't we,
[539.56 --> 540.40]  why don't we move on
[540.40 --> 541.76]  to sort of the other,
[541.96 --> 542.66]  uh,
[542.66 --> 543.64]  the other heavy topic
[543.64 --> 544.54]  for this week,
[544.54 --> 545.78]  which is,
[545.98 --> 546.44]  of course,
[546.78 --> 547.48]  um,
[548.56 --> 548.82]  honey.
[550.86 --> 551.34]  So,
[551.62 --> 552.64]  first of all,
[552.74 --> 553.10]  uh,
[553.26 --> 554.28]  big shout out to
[554.28 --> 555.34]  Megaleg for,
[555.94 --> 556.34]  um,
[556.42 --> 557.54]  for the work
[557.54 --> 558.36]  that was done
[558.36 --> 559.28]  reporting on,
[559.28 --> 560.10]  uh,
[560.14 --> 561.12]  what honey and actually,
[561.20 --> 561.30]  well,
[561.34 --> 562.44]  parent company PayPal
[562.44 --> 563.78]  has been up to
[563.78 --> 564.84]  with respect to,
[564.84 --> 570.30]  this is truly a very
[570.30 --> 571.42]  professional podcast,
[571.60 --> 572.50]  video podcast,
[572.60 --> 573.52]  whatever this thing is.
[573.98 --> 574.86]  Thank you for that,
[574.92 --> 575.08]  Luke.
[575.48 --> 575.92]  Yeah.
[576.60 --> 577.46]  Since when are you
[577.46 --> 578.24]  the comic relief?
[580.74 --> 582.00]  Your job is to laugh
[582.00 --> 582.88]  at the comic relief.
[583.04 --> 583.54]  You're the laugh track.
[583.84 --> 585.62]  I think that's my only
[585.62 --> 586.90]  standard alarm for this week
[586.90 --> 587.84]  that I didn't pause
[587.84 --> 588.36]  for the week.
[588.82 --> 589.00]  Nice.
[589.00 --> 589.38]  Because I was out.
[589.76 --> 589.94]  Right.
[590.08 --> 590.80]  And that's my like
[590.80 --> 592.12]  leave for Wancho alarm.
[592.24 --> 593.22]  And then Wancho was early
[593.22 --> 594.84]  because I have a flight
[594.84 --> 595.32]  to catch.
[595.76 --> 596.20]  Brilliant.
[597.02 --> 597.42]  Um,
[597.78 --> 598.02]  yeah.
[598.14 --> 599.46]  So massive shout out
[599.46 --> 599.78]  to,
[599.78 --> 601.14]  to Megaleg for the work
[601.14 --> 601.68]  that,
[601.78 --> 602.10]  um,
[602.10 --> 603.02]  that he put into
[603.02 --> 604.36]  digging into
[604.36 --> 605.40]  what exactly honey's
[605.40 --> 605.88]  been doing.
[606.28 --> 606.66]  Um,
[607.28 --> 608.40]  so I've got,
[608.52 --> 609.16]  I've got a few things
[609.16 --> 609.86]  to kind of discuss.
[609.86 --> 610.44]  First of all,
[610.50 --> 611.52]  the only point
[611.52 --> 612.68]  from Megaleg's video
[612.68 --> 613.56]  that we were aware
[613.56 --> 614.60]  of three years ago
[614.60 --> 615.44]  when we halted
[615.44 --> 616.20]  our honey sponsorship
[616.20 --> 617.74]  was the affiliate code
[617.74 --> 618.38]  ripping.
[618.68 --> 619.16]  Uh,
[619.16 --> 619.86]  we heard about that
[619.86 --> 620.66]  from some tweets,
[620.84 --> 621.12]  uh,
[621.12 --> 621.64]  like this one
[621.64 --> 622.18]  from Barnacles.
[625.50 --> 626.06]  Um,
[626.50 --> 628.56]  we also saw it
[628.56 --> 628.98]  covered,
[629.38 --> 629.80]  um,
[630.10 --> 632.44]  on our own forum.
[634.12 --> 635.02]  There we go.
[635.84 --> 636.98]  So there was,
[637.22 --> 638.34]  that was not,
[638.50 --> 639.46]  that was not really,
[639.80 --> 640.20]  um,
[640.20 --> 640.90]  news,
[641.54 --> 642.28]  that part of it.
[643.06 --> 643.48]  Um,
[643.80 --> 644.42]  but,
[644.50 --> 644.68]  you know,
[644.76 --> 645.30]  obviously,
[645.30 --> 646.38]  as a,
[646.46 --> 646.68]  as,
[646.76 --> 647.44]  as creators,
[647.64 --> 648.72]  we saw that
[648.72 --> 649.36]  and we were like,
[649.50 --> 649.72]  hey,
[650.12 --> 650.60]  um,
[650.86 --> 653.76]  that's not really cool.
[653.98 --> 654.18]  Yeah.
[654.24 --> 654.50]  Uh,
[654.50 --> 655.40]  but we didn't really,
[655.60 --> 657.00]  we didn't really think
[657.00 --> 657.72]  that other than,
[657.80 --> 658.04]  you know,
[658.16 --> 659.76]  any creator friends,
[659.94 --> 660.52]  um,
[661.48 --> 662.20]  that it was something
[662.20 --> 662.92]  that impacted
[662.92 --> 664.12]  the general consumer.
[664.12 --> 665.30]  So it wasn't something
[665.30 --> 666.08]  that really merited
[666.08 --> 667.06]  a full video
[667.06 --> 667.98]  or anything like that.
[668.68 --> 669.16]  Um,
[669.16 --> 672.54]  okay.
[672.76 --> 673.08]  Thanks,
[673.16 --> 673.36]  Dan.
[673.94 --> 674.22]  Uh,
[674.24 --> 674.68]  were you,
[674.86 --> 675.96]  were you live for that?
[676.08 --> 676.88]  They heard you or no?
[677.14 --> 677.36]  Oh,
[677.42 --> 677.60]  okay.
[677.60 --> 678.08]  Dan said,
[678.14 --> 678.26]  yeah,
[678.26 --> 678.80]  he's done
[678.80 --> 680.08]  and the goal is done.
[680.08 --> 680.62]  But guys,
[681.02 --> 681.60]  please,
[681.72 --> 682.12]  um,
[682.42 --> 684.80]  I'm sure that the goal
[684.80 --> 687.14]  is really helpful.
[687.40 --> 687.92]  Uh,
[687.92 --> 689.14]  but I'm sure that any,
[689.26 --> 690.04]  any little bits,
[690.10 --> 690.44]  um,
[691.44 --> 691.68]  could,
[692.12 --> 693.20]  any little bits
[693.20 --> 693.40]  could,
[693.48 --> 693.92]  could help.
[694.34 --> 694.60]  Um,
[694.60 --> 694.78]  yeah,
[694.86 --> 695.90]  I don't think,
[695.90 --> 696.54]  uh,
[696.76 --> 697.48]  GoFundMe looks like
[697.48 --> 698.20]  it's real time.
[698.20 --> 698.64]  Um,
[698.64 --> 699.94]  so we'll have to wait a sec
[699.94 --> 700.84]  for that to come through.
[701.00 --> 701.22]  Okay.
[702.12 --> 702.60]  Thanks,
[702.68 --> 702.82]  Dan.
[704.22 --> 704.70]  Okay.
[705.16 --> 705.64]  Anyway,
[705.96 --> 706.70]  affiliate code ripping,
[706.90 --> 707.20]  bad,
[707.52 --> 708.20]  affects creators,
[708.30 --> 709.32]  doesn't affect the end user.
[709.86 --> 710.10]  Uh,
[710.84 --> 711.22]  we,
[711.64 --> 713.36]  we were not the only ones
[713.36 --> 714.58]  who knew about the scam,
[714.64 --> 714.78]  though.
[715.08 --> 716.38]  Here's a video from 2020.
[716.38 --> 718.70]  I actually didn't watch this one,
[718.70 --> 720.98]  but,
[721.10 --> 722.72]  I don't know.
[722.88 --> 723.00]  I,
[723.22 --> 723.24]  I,
[723.24 --> 724.44]  the whole thing for me
[724.44 --> 725.70]  with this is that
[725.70 --> 726.98]  Mega Leg did reach out
[726.98 --> 727.78]  to us for comment
[727.78 --> 729.90]  and my general position
[729.90 --> 730.86]  on it was,
[731.26 --> 731.84]  uh,
[732.06 --> 732.84]  yeah,
[733.30 --> 733.92]  we,
[733.92 --> 735.32]  we dropped these guys
[735.32 --> 736.58]  three years ago.
[736.92 --> 737.36]  Um,
[737.42 --> 738.68]  this all came out,
[738.68 --> 739.22]  like the,
[739.22 --> 740.28]  the affiliate ripping stuff,
[740.34 --> 741.20]  everything we knew about
[741.20 --> 742.22]  came out years ago.
[742.66 --> 743.68]  I'm very interested
[743.68 --> 744.72]  to see the video
[744.72 --> 745.66]  on all the other stuff.
[745.84 --> 746.90]  I don't really know
[746.90 --> 748.00]  what exactly
[748.00 --> 749.10]  it has to do with us.
[749.28 --> 749.48]  I,
[749.70 --> 751.38]  I'm a little confused
[751.38 --> 752.30]  at still
[752.30 --> 753.18]  as to
[753.18 --> 754.46]  what exactly,
[754.84 --> 755.28]  um,
[756.28 --> 757.68]  it has to do with us.
[758.64 --> 759.04]  Um,
[759.50 --> 759.82]  anyway,
[759.98 --> 761.04]  back when we dropped Honey,
[761.14 --> 761.80]  we had a call
[761.80 --> 762.82]  with their executive team.
[763.00 --> 763.88]  It was clear
[763.88 --> 765.06]  that they had no intention
[765.06 --> 765.98]  in,
[766.14 --> 766.46]  uh,
[766.54 --> 767.58]  intention to revise
[767.58 --> 768.36]  their business model
[768.36 --> 769.14]  away from the affiliate
[769.14 --> 769.66]  code ripping.
[769.94 --> 770.34]  Uh,
[770.34 --> 771.38]  so we decided to end
[771.38 --> 772.44]  our sponsorship agreement
[772.44 --> 772.88]  with them.
[773.60 --> 774.04]  Um,
[775.18 --> 775.94]  if we'd known
[775.94 --> 777.12]  about any of the more
[777.12 --> 778.54]  end-user-centric issues
[778.54 --> 779.78]  discussed in Megaleg's video,
[779.88 --> 780.54]  such as purposely
[780.54 --> 781.38]  not giving users
[781.38 --> 782.28]  the best deal possible
[782.28 --> 783.24]  because of behind-the-scenes
[783.24 --> 784.26]  partnerships with companies,
[784.78 --> 786.78]  we very probably
[786.78 --> 787.40]  would have raised
[787.40 --> 788.10]  more alarm bells,
[788.20 --> 789.12]  but we had no reason
[789.12 --> 789.74]  at that time
[789.74 --> 790.56]  to believe that Honey
[790.56 --> 791.70]  was anything other than
[791.70 --> 793.06]  what it claimed to be,
[793.14 --> 794.48]  which was a coupon-finding
[794.48 --> 796.00]  service that took
[796.00 --> 796.74]  an affiliate cut.
[797.46 --> 797.78]  Um,
[799.04 --> 800.28]  many in the industry
[800.28 --> 801.28]  stopped working with Honey,
[801.38 --> 802.98]  without an LTT video
[802.98 --> 803.46]  being made,
[803.56 --> 804.98]  so I think that
[804.98 --> 806.02]  one characterization
[806.02 --> 807.46]  of this whole situation
[807.46 --> 808.38]  that, like,
[808.38 --> 810.82]  we knew and didn't
[810.82 --> 811.42]  tell anybody
[811.42 --> 812.86]  is, um,
[814.06 --> 814.80]  bizarre.
[815.28 --> 816.02]  We were publicly
[816.02 --> 817.46]  informed by other people
[817.46 --> 818.92]  and then acted on it.
[820.82 --> 821.34]  Also,
[821.58 --> 822.60]  we publicly posted
[822.60 --> 823.34]  on our forum
[823.34 --> 824.46]  that we dropped them
[824.46 --> 826.16]  and gave the reason
[826.16 --> 826.66]  for it.
[826.76 --> 827.68]  We've also never really
[827.68 --> 828.32]  been, like,
[828.48 --> 829.12]  people have tried
[829.12 --> 830.02]  to draw parallels
[830.02 --> 830.70]  between this
[830.70 --> 831.84]  and Eufy,
[832.26 --> 833.06]  but Eufy's
[833.06 --> 834.02]  a tech company
[834.02 --> 836.06]  that had huge
[836.06 --> 837.06]  end-user problems.
[837.12 --> 837.42]  Yes.
[837.76 --> 838.60]  Like, this is,
[838.70 --> 839.46]  that's a totally,
[839.56 --> 840.12]  that's something
[840.12 --> 840.86]  that we do,
[840.96 --> 841.38]  that is something
[841.38 --> 842.32]  that we have done
[842.32 --> 842.84]  always.
[842.84 --> 843.64]  And Eufy
[843.64 --> 845.68]  had major implications,
[846.14 --> 846.22]  like,
[846.66 --> 847.14]  immediately,
[847.42 --> 848.18]  right now,
[848.26 --> 849.14]  for user privacy.
[849.40 --> 849.58]  Yeah.
[849.58 --> 850.38]  Um,
[851.02 --> 851.42]  whereas,
[852.34 --> 852.82]  Honey,
[853.16 --> 853.60]  it's,
[853.68 --> 853.94]  it's,
[854.18 --> 855.00]  in some ways,
[855.04 --> 855.26]  it's,
[855.36 --> 855.44]  like,
[855.46 --> 856.42]  more insidious,
[856.70 --> 857.26]  uh,
[857.26 --> 858.16]  but in other ways,
[858.24 --> 858.82]  it's,
[858.82 --> 859.38]  um,
[859.96 --> 861.76]  it's less
[861.76 --> 862.96]  immediately damaging
[862.96 --> 863.48]  than,
[863.74 --> 863.80]  like,
[863.90 --> 864.12]  hey,
[864.22 --> 865.40]  an unencrypted
[865.40 --> 866.30]  feed of,
[866.36 --> 866.52]  like,
[866.56 --> 867.44]  every camera
[867.44 --> 868.76]  that our company
[868.76 --> 869.40]  has sold.
[870.26 --> 870.74]  Like,
[870.80 --> 871.16]  that's,
[871.30 --> 871.56]  there's,
[871.64 --> 872.64]  there's bad,
[872.86 --> 873.50]  and then there's,
[873.60 --> 873.84]  like,
[875.12 --> 875.40]  really,
[875.48 --> 875.64]  really,
[875.72 --> 875.98]  really,
[876.08 --> 876.48]  really,
[876.48 --> 877.24]  really bad.
[877.50 --> 878.26]  And also in our realm.
[878.72 --> 879.16]  Um,
[879.58 --> 880.98]  as for Karma,
[881.42 --> 882.40]  why we took a sponsorship
[882.40 --> 882.92]  from Karma,
[883.06 --> 883.72]  they assured us
[883.72 --> 884.34]  that they didn't do
[884.34 --> 885.20]  any link yoinking,
[885.38 --> 886.12]  which when we tested
[886.12 --> 887.04]  it seemed to be true.
[887.42 --> 887.74]  Uh,
[887.74 --> 888.94]  we only worked with them once.
[889.08 --> 890.26]  We did four sponsor spots
[890.26 --> 891.00]  on three videos,
[891.00 --> 892.10]  and then,
[892.78 --> 893.64]  I guess they changed
[893.64 --> 894.16]  since then.
[894.96 --> 895.36]  Um,
[895.64 --> 897.82]  as for the landing page
[897.82 --> 898.86]  that uses our likeness
[898.86 --> 899.44]  to promote Honey,
[899.64 --> 900.80]  we no longer have
[900.80 --> 901.88]  any direct contacts
[901.88 --> 902.56]  that are working there,
[902.60 --> 903.04]  but we're working
[903.04 --> 903.96]  to have the page removed.
[904.08 --> 904.82]  Hopefully we can.
[905.24 --> 905.42]  Uh,
[905.42 --> 906.30]  speaking of Eufy,
[906.52 --> 907.40]  Anchor still uses
[907.40 --> 908.06]  our likeness,
[908.14 --> 908.52]  um,
[908.52 --> 911.04]  and with these
[911.04 --> 911.80]  really large
[911.80 --> 912.50]  and in some cases
[912.50 --> 913.28]  overseas companies,
[913.28 --> 914.36]  it can be very difficult
[914.36 --> 915.60]  to get stuff like that fixed.
[916.94 --> 917.34]  Um,
[918.78 --> 919.70]  Ike's Orange says,
[919.88 --> 920.18]  Linus,
[920.24 --> 921.30]  people think that
[921.30 --> 921.98]  because the video
[921.98 --> 922.70]  sort of implies
[922.70 --> 923.64]  that only you knew,
[923.94 --> 924.48]  so people are
[924.48 --> 925.42]  misinterpreting that.
[925.92 --> 926.26]  I mean,
[926.36 --> 926.88]  I think,
[926.98 --> 927.82]  I don't think it sort of
[927.82 --> 928.30]  implies,
[928.42 --> 928.74]  I think,
[928.80 --> 930.38]  our prominent featuring
[930.38 --> 931.14]  in the video,
[931.14 --> 931.74]  uh,
[931.78 --> 932.62]  leads people there.
[932.72 --> 932.88]  I,
[932.96 --> 933.96]  I don't really understand
[933.96 --> 935.10]  that.
[935.10 --> 935.82]  I don't really,
[935.94 --> 936.22]  uh,
[936.94 --> 937.54]  I don't really,
[937.68 --> 938.42]  I don't really get
[938.42 --> 939.66]  the emphasis on us,
[939.72 --> 940.62]  to be honest with you.
[941.36 --> 941.80]  Um,
[942.52 --> 945.72]  I,
[945.80 --> 946.36]  I don't really,
[946.54 --> 947.32]  I don't really know
[947.32 --> 948.54]  what people are expecting
[948.54 --> 949.34]  me to say about it
[949.34 --> 949.82]  other than,
[950.22 --> 950.82]  yeah,
[951.00 --> 951.54]  we,
[951.66 --> 952.00]  we,
[952.14 --> 952.62]  like,
[952.68 --> 953.28]  heard about it
[953.28 --> 953.84]  in the news,
[954.08 --> 955.52]  same as apparently
[955.52 --> 956.90]  basically everyone else,
[957.00 --> 958.10]  given how many folks
[958.10 --> 959.08]  stopped working with them
[959.08 --> 959.84]  in the 2020,
[960.02 --> 961.02]  2021 timeframe.
[962.08 --> 962.56]  And,
[962.68 --> 964.16]  um,
[964.90 --> 966.56]  yeah,
[966.94 --> 968.22]  yeah,
[968.46 --> 971.38]  cool.
[972.58 --> 973.02]  Um,
[973.52 --> 974.38]  sea surfer says,
[974.44 --> 975.32]  it's also arguable
[975.32 --> 976.54]  that LTT was by far
[976.54 --> 977.32]  the largest channel
[977.32 --> 978.44]  and thus had the platform
[978.44 --> 979.76]  to motivate wider change.
[980.14 --> 981.12]  It's arguable.
[981.22 --> 981.86]  It's very difficult
[981.86 --> 982.44]  to argue.
[982.60 --> 982.92]  I mean,
[982.92 --> 983.76]  given that Mr.
[983.84 --> 984.62]  Beast was the number
[984.62 --> 985.64]  one honey promoter,
[985.76 --> 987.16]  I think that if you were
[987.16 --> 987.96]  to make the argument
[987.96 --> 989.44]  that LTT is bigger
[989.44 --> 990.22]  than Mr. Beast,
[990.38 --> 990.64]  then,
[991.32 --> 991.66]  um,
[991.78 --> 992.82]  not only would that
[992.82 --> 994.36]  be a difficult argument,
[994.54 --> 995.24]  you'd be kind of
[995.24 --> 995.90]  a f***ing idiot.
[996.38 --> 996.60]  So,
[997.92 --> 998.16]  like,
[998.22 --> 998.34]  I,
[998.54 --> 1001.94]  I don't know,
[1002.10 --> 1002.58]  dude.
[1003.80 --> 1004.28]  Um,
[1004.68 --> 1007.16]  cool.
[1014.44 --> 1015.62]  Should we move on?
[1015.70 --> 1015.80]  Like,
[1015.84 --> 1016.24]  I don't really,
[1016.54 --> 1016.88]  I don't,
[1016.96 --> 1017.50]  I don't have a ton
[1017.50 --> 1018.42]  else to say on this,
[1018.48 --> 1018.82]  I think.
[1018.94 --> 1019.12]  Like,
[1019.24 --> 1019.50]  I,
[1019.78 --> 1020.02]  yeah,
[1020.24 --> 1020.60]  honestly,
[1020.68 --> 1021.10]  when I was,
[1021.24 --> 1021.70]  when I was,
[1021.82 --> 1022.70]  I watched the video
[1022.70 --> 1027.68]  and I remembered us
[1027.68 --> 1028.52]  dropping honey,
[1029.04 --> 1029.92]  but didn't particularly
[1029.92 --> 1030.94]  remember the reasons.
[1031.36 --> 1032.30]  After some people
[1032.30 --> 1033.40]  brought up the,
[1033.46 --> 1034.68]  the old video
[1034.68 --> 1035.48]  that you had mentioned
[1035.48 --> 1037.10]  and a couple other things,
[1037.10 --> 1038.08]  I like vaguely
[1038.08 --> 1038.96]  remembered that,
[1039.10 --> 1039.58]  uh,
[1039.58 --> 1040.10]  but I wasn't really
[1040.10 --> 1040.98]  a part of video stuff
[1040.98 --> 1041.52]  at that time.
[1041.52 --> 1041.70]  So,
[1041.70 --> 1041.96]  like,
[1042.14 --> 1042.58]  I don't know.
[1042.72 --> 1043.18]  I don't know.
[1043.30 --> 1044.56]  The situation's bizarre,
[1044.70 --> 1044.88]  dude.
[1044.88 --> 1045.14]  Like,
[1045.72 --> 1046.92]  I am a victim here.
[1047.20 --> 1048.00]  I was surprised.
[1048.20 --> 1049.16]  I don't know if people
[1049.16 --> 1049.90]  notice that.
[1050.04 --> 1050.14]  Yeah.
[1050.28 --> 1050.48]  Like,
[1050.54 --> 1051.38]  as a creator
[1051.38 --> 1052.76]  for whom,
[1052.80 --> 1053.32]  uh,
[1053.32 --> 1054.42]  affiliate revenue
[1054.42 --> 1055.58]  from Amazon
[1055.58 --> 1056.54]  was,
[1056.70 --> 1057.04]  uh,
[1057.04 --> 1058.06]  in 2020,
[1058.66 --> 1059.48]  7%
[1059.48 --> 1060.72]  of our business
[1060.72 --> 1062.04]  team's revenue.
[1062.82 --> 1063.22]  Um,
[1063.80 --> 1065.54]  like,
[1065.78 --> 1067.10]  this had
[1067.10 --> 1068.18]  a significant impact
[1068.18 --> 1068.78]  on our business
[1068.78 --> 1069.52]  and absolutely
[1069.52 --> 1070.38]  it would have impacted
[1070.38 --> 1071.50]  other creators too
[1071.50 --> 1072.88]  and they are victims
[1072.88 --> 1073.38]  in this,
[1073.46 --> 1074.38]  but it doesn't change
[1074.38 --> 1075.32]  that anyone
[1075.32 --> 1076.22]  who affiliate,
[1076.44 --> 1077.86]  who relied on
[1077.86 --> 1078.58]  affiliate revenue
[1078.58 --> 1079.50]  and who had it
[1079.50 --> 1080.30]  skimmed by honey
[1080.30 --> 1082.18]  was victimized
[1082.18 --> 1082.74]  by honey.
[1082.96 --> 1084.26]  We were compensated,
[1084.38 --> 1084.80]  at least
[1084.80 --> 1085.90]  partially,
[1086.32 --> 1087.42]  by being,
[1087.42 --> 1087.70]  a lot of the,
[1087.70 --> 1088.76]  yeah,
[1088.80 --> 1089.28]  a lot of the people
[1089.28 --> 1090.26]  that were sponsored
[1090.26 --> 1090.66]  by them were,
[1090.72 --> 1091.20]  which was like
[1091.20 --> 1092.08]  the internet
[1092.08 --> 1093.10]  at that point in time.
[1093.22 --> 1093.40]  Yep.
[1094.08 --> 1094.90]  But like,
[1095.68 --> 1098.10]  guys.
[1098.10 --> 1100.02]  And then the Karma Now
[1100.02 --> 1101.46]  thing looked bad.
[1102.50 --> 1103.18]  Working with them
[1103.18 --> 1103.64]  one time,
[1103.76 --> 1104.16]  that's,
[1104.26 --> 1105.16]  that's something that
[1105.16 --> 1105.98]  stood out to me
[1105.98 --> 1106.58]  quite a bit
[1106.58 --> 1107.36]  during the video
[1107.36 --> 1107.88]  was that it was
[1107.88 --> 1108.56]  assessed in its
[1108.56 --> 1109.20]  current state
[1109.20 --> 1109.86]  because you,
[1109.94 --> 1110.80]  you obviously can't
[1110.80 --> 1111.66]  go back and assess
[1111.66 --> 1112.36]  it from the past.
[1112.94 --> 1113.34]  Um,
[1113.94 --> 1115.04]  but that gets tough
[1115.04 --> 1116.28]  because you don't know
[1116.28 --> 1117.86]  like what you guys
[1117.86 --> 1118.22]  were saying,
[1118.30 --> 1118.46]  they,
[1118.52 --> 1119.34]  they assured that
[1119.34 --> 1120.42]  it didn't work that way,
[1120.46 --> 1121.08]  you tested it,
[1121.14 --> 1121.32]  okay,
[1121.40 --> 1121.60]  cool.
[1121.78 --> 1123.00]  They can change it on you.
[1123.10 --> 1123.68]  They could have changed
[1123.68 --> 1124.40]  it on you immediately
[1124.40 --> 1125.36]  after the sponsor spots
[1125.36 --> 1125.72]  went up.
[1126.00 --> 1126.16]  Well,
[1126.18 --> 1126.32]  yeah,
[1126.34 --> 1126.68]  I don't know.
[1126.76 --> 1127.08]  I don't know.
[1127.16 --> 1127.62]  We don't know when it
[1127.62 --> 1127.90]  happened.
[1127.90 --> 1128.42]  I don't know.
[1128.62 --> 1128.94]  That was,
[1129.10 --> 1130.82]  it was all years ago.
[1130.84 --> 1130.86]  Could have happened
[1130.86 --> 1131.72]  years later.
[1132.30 --> 1132.34]  Like,
[1133.22 --> 1133.68]  who knows?
[1135.92 --> 1136.32]  Yeah.
[1136.62 --> 1137.26]  Voight says,
[1137.36 --> 1137.60]  for me,
[1137.66 --> 1138.24]  it felt like Honey
[1138.24 --> 1139.04]  was quietly dropped
[1139.04 --> 1139.56]  as a sponsor
[1139.56 --> 1140.52]  with no messy breakup.
[1140.78 --> 1141.30]  Could have been
[1141.30 --> 1141.86]  any reason.
[1142.56 --> 1142.88]  Um,
[1143.34 --> 1144.46]  but as you said,
[1144.54 --> 1145.32]  back then you only knew
[1145.32 --> 1146.18]  about the affiliate ripping,
[1146.36 --> 1147.04]  which isn't too bad,
[1147.10 --> 1147.76]  especially for users.
[1147.84 --> 1147.98]  Yeah,
[1148.24 --> 1148.76]  exactly.
[1149.00 --> 1150.36]  It's really bad for creators.
[1150.66 --> 1150.80]  Yeah,
[1150.82 --> 1151.94]  it's really bad for creators.
[1152.20 --> 1153.32]  But it was also being
[1153.32 --> 1154.78]  blasted from the rooftops
[1154.78 --> 1155.60]  at that point in time.
[1155.62 --> 1155.64]  Yeah,
[1155.68 --> 1155.96]  like,
[1155.96 --> 1156.48]  I don't know,
[1156.54 --> 1157.34]  maybe Mega Leg
[1157.34 --> 1158.58]  is living up to his name.
[1160.62 --> 1161.24]  It's like,
[1161.34 --> 1162.30]  at that point in time,
[1162.30 --> 1163.24]  it's also like,
[1163.30 --> 1164.18]  not really our story
[1164.18 --> 1164.66]  to break.
[1164.80 --> 1165.24]  Like,
[1165.28 --> 1165.92]  if other people
[1165.92 --> 1167.04]  are already reporting on it
[1167.04 --> 1168.16]  and it's getting around a lot.
[1168.90 --> 1169.34]  Um,
[1169.34 --> 1172.38]  I think it's blowing up
[1172.38 --> 1173.10]  so much right now
[1173.10 --> 1174.14]  because of the,
[1174.14 --> 1175.50]  um,
[1175.56 --> 1176.72]  the downsides for users.
[1178.00 --> 1178.44]  Yeah,
[1178.48 --> 1179.34]  I could see that.
[1180.36 --> 1180.80]  Yep.
[1182.36 --> 1182.72]  Um,
[1182.78 --> 1182.96]  sure.
[1183.58 --> 1183.92]  Yeah,
[1184.02 --> 1184.48]  so,
[1184.48 --> 1186.22]  cool.
[1186.64 --> 1187.22]  Moving on.
[1187.34 --> 1187.60]  Yeah.
[1188.00 --> 1188.86]  Positive things?
[1190.62 --> 1191.02]  Yeah,
[1191.26 --> 1191.60]  yeah,
[1191.68 --> 1192.32]  can we do that?
[1192.58 --> 1193.18]  Do you want to talk about
[1193.18 --> 1193.92]  the Colin and Samir?
[1194.38 --> 1194.78]  Um,
[1195.14 --> 1195.44]  no,
[1195.62 --> 1196.48]  maybe 2024?
[1196.48 --> 1197.48]  Why don't we talk about
[1197.48 --> 1198.62]  RTX 5090?
[1198.86 --> 1199.14]  Oh.
[1199.44 --> 1200.18]  Because we don't know
[1200.18 --> 1200.98]  the price yet,
[1200.98 --> 1202.46]  so we can still kind of
[1202.46 --> 1202.96]  have fun,
[1203.32 --> 1204.38]  and we could pretend
[1204.38 --> 1205.48]  that, like,
[1206.16 --> 1207.26]  anyone will be able
[1207.26 --> 1208.88]  to afford an RTX 5090.
[1209.30 --> 1209.72]  Do you,
[1209.72 --> 1210.86]  do you guys want to play
[1210.86 --> 1211.98]  pretend for a little bit?
[1212.18 --> 1212.62]  Sure.
[1212.62 --> 1213.22]  Okay,
[1213.42 --> 1213.74]  I would,
[1213.84 --> 1214.62]  I would like that,
[1214.68 --> 1214.88]  though.
[1215.54 --> 1215.78]  Uh,
[1215.84 --> 1216.04]  cool.
[1216.18 --> 1217.34]  I still have both kidneys,
[1217.56 --> 1218.26]  so I'm good.
[1218.60 --> 1219.00]  Nice.
[1219.22 --> 1219.64]  Nice.
[1219.72 --> 1220.34]  Not for long,
[1220.42 --> 1220.62]  Dan.
[1220.80 --> 1221.18]  Yay!
[1222.06 --> 1223.70]  New images have leaked
[1223.70 --> 1226.86]  of a populated RTX 5090 PCB,
[1227.14 --> 1227.80]  and it looks
[1227.80 --> 1229.18]  full.
[1230.04 --> 1232.40]  Oh my goodness.
[1232.64 --> 1232.88]  Full.
[1234.00 --> 1234.56]  Wow,
[1234.74 --> 1235.80]  that is dense
[1235.80 --> 1237.22]  with two S's.
[1237.80 --> 1238.42]  That is
[1238.42 --> 1239.42]  wild.
[1239.42 --> 1239.54]  wild.
[1239.98 --> 1240.92]  So there's your
[1240.92 --> 1241.74]  allegedly,
[1242.52 --> 1244.68]  alleged 32 gigs
[1244.68 --> 1247.76]  of GDDR7 RAMs.
[1248.82 --> 1250.96]  There is all the VRMs,
[1251.46 --> 1252.40]  and then there is
[1252.40 --> 1253.84]  all the rest of them.
[1254.94 --> 1256.04]  Look at this thing.
[1256.28 --> 1256.88]  Do you have a comparison
[1256.88 --> 1257.54]  of the 4090?
[1257.74 --> 1258.36]  Do you have both up?
[1258.48 --> 1258.72]  I,
[1258.72 --> 1258.94]  I,
[1258.94 --> 1259.74]  I don't.
[1259.84 --> 1260.74]  I don't have the 4090.
[1260.74 --> 1261.28]  There's a link to it
[1261.28 --> 1261.66]  in the dark.
[1261.66 --> 1261.78]  Oh,
[1261.82 --> 1262.58]  is there a link in the dark?
[1262.62 --> 1262.80]  Oh,
[1262.88 --> 1263.18]  incredible.
[1263.38 --> 1263.58]  Okay,
[1263.74 --> 1265.72]  and the 4090 was already
[1265.72 --> 1267.18]  a dense mama-jama.
[1268.26 --> 1268.50]  Because,
[1268.58 --> 1268.96]  remember,
[1268.96 --> 1269.36]  the whole,
[1269.40 --> 1269.56]  like,
[1269.64 --> 1271.56]  through PCB cooling thing.
[1271.64 --> 1271.74]  Yeah.
[1272.08 --> 1272.48]  Um,
[1272.80 --> 1273.42]  wow.
[1274.02 --> 1274.54]  So that's a,
[1274.56 --> 1275.40]  that's a 4090.
[1275.62 --> 1275.96]  Uh,
[1276.00 --> 1277.42]  credit to WCCF Tech
[1277.42 --> 1277.88]  for,
[1277.88 --> 1278.72]  uh,
[1278.78 --> 1279.38]  posting that.
[1279.46 --> 1280.00]  I don't know if they're
[1280.00 --> 1281.42]  actually the original
[1281.42 --> 1283.10]  poster of it.
[1283.36 --> 1283.74]  Oh,
[1283.92 --> 1284.90]  here's the blank one.
[1285.08 --> 1286.24]  I don't know what it is,
[1286.28 --> 1287.16]  but there is something
[1287.16 --> 1289.14]  about a blank,
[1289.58 --> 1291.18]  unpopulated PCB
[1291.18 --> 1292.52]  with just all the pads
[1292.52 --> 1293.56]  that just is like,
[1294.10 --> 1295.46]  yeah,
[1295.60 --> 1295.94]  right?
[1296.44 --> 1296.94]  Like,
[1297.04 --> 1297.44]  damn.
[1298.40 --> 1298.64]  Like,
[1298.72 --> 1298.94]  damn.
[1298.96 --> 1299.18]  Like,
[1299.42 --> 1299.90]  damn.
[1300.54 --> 1301.02]  Damn.
[1301.34 --> 1301.66]  You know,
[1301.74 --> 1301.94]  like,
[1302.76 --> 1303.28]  damn.
[1304.82 --> 1305.22]  Uh,
[1305.36 --> 1305.90]  damn.
[1306.96 --> 1308.08]  We're losing it today.
[1308.14 --> 1308.58]  Yeah,
[1308.62 --> 1309.66]  so I slept about
[1309.66 --> 1310.88]  three hours last night,
[1310.88 --> 1312.08]  just so you have some idea.
[1312.22 --> 1312.34]  Like,
[1312.42 --> 1312.66]  I'm,
[1312.84 --> 1313.52]  dude,
[1313.60 --> 1313.76]  I'm,
[1313.82 --> 1314.42]  I'm barely,
[1314.62 --> 1316.18]  I'm barely functional today.
[1316.18 --> 1316.66]  it's,
[1316.96 --> 1317.52]  so the,
[1317.52 --> 1317.80]  the,
[1317.80 --> 1319.82]  the rumors of the 5090
[1319.82 --> 1322.48]  is that it has 21,760 CUDA cores
[1322.48 --> 1323.80]  compared to the 4090's
[1323.80 --> 1325.62]  16,384.
[1325.96 --> 1327.06]  Pretty big jump.
[1327.36 --> 1329.52]  The memory goes up to 32 gigs,
[1329.52 --> 1330.34]  uh,
[1330.34 --> 1331.24]  which you would have needed,
[1331.24 --> 1332.16]  like,
[1333.04 --> 1333.28]  uh,
[1333.86 --> 1334.14]  you know,
[1334.40 --> 1336.46]  beyond 4090 in the past to have.
[1336.58 --> 1338.04]  Which almost certainly means
[1338.04 --> 1340.26]  it has a 512-bit memory bus,
[1340.32 --> 1340.88]  which is like,
[1341.12 --> 1342.82]  that combined
[1342.82 --> 1344.66]  with going to GDDR7,
[1344.66 --> 1345.18]  it's like,
[1345.44 --> 1345.96]  what?
[1346.32 --> 1347.54]  16 modules of memory.
[1347.96 --> 1348.52]  Um,
[1348.58 --> 1349.28]  power stages,
[1349.42 --> 1351.44]  29 versus 4090's 23.
[1352.02 --> 1352.38]  PCB,
[1352.68 --> 1354.08]  14 layers
[1354.08 --> 1356.34]  compared to the 4090's 12.
[1356.80 --> 1357.66]  And the MSRP,
[1358.10 --> 1359.78]  probably too much for all of us.
[1359.78 --> 1360.22]  I don't know,
[1360.22 --> 1360.44]  dude.
[1360.54 --> 1361.06]  I don't know.
[1361.16 --> 1361.72]  Look at this.
[1361.98 --> 1362.60]  Look at this.
[1363.58 --> 1364.96]  1599 US.
[1365.62 --> 1367.48]  I see only three question marks.
[1368.00 --> 1368.44]  That,
[1368.56 --> 1368.88]  to me,
[1368.94 --> 1369.62]  indicates,
[1369.80 --> 1370.24]  indicates,
[1370.36 --> 1371.54]  and they might have typo'd.
[1371.64 --> 1372.06]  We definitely,
[1372.16 --> 1372.28]  yeah.
[1372.34 --> 1373.66]  They might have forgotten a decimal.
[1374.08 --> 1374.28]  Oh.
[1374.28 --> 1375.36]  We could be looking at,
[1375.58 --> 1376.16]  A single dollar.
[1376.34 --> 1377.92]  We could be looking at $1.
[1378.36 --> 1378.60]  Wow.
[1378.60 --> 1380.12]  As low as $1, Luke.
[1380.22 --> 1380.82]  Very nice.
[1381.48 --> 1383.42]  As low as $1.00 and 0 cents.
[1383.62 --> 1384.80]  I think it could happen.
[1385.84 --> 1387.00]  I think it could happen.
[1387.72 --> 1388.60]  Discussion question is,
[1388.68 --> 1390.24]  what is your max limit on price,
[1390.32 --> 1391.38]  assuming performance is good
[1391.38 --> 1392.30]  compared to last gen?
[1394.06 --> 1394.50]  Okay,
[1394.60 --> 1394.78]  so,
[1395.06 --> 1395.58]  here's the thing.
[1396.04 --> 1397.56]  I think I've talked about this
[1397.56 --> 1398.28]  a fair bit,
[1398.52 --> 1398.70]  but,
[1398.98 --> 1399.76]  it bears repeating,
[1399.88 --> 1400.90]  because NVIDIA waits
[1400.90 --> 1401.70]  two to three years
[1401.70 --> 1403.22]  between releasing GPUs now.
[1403.22 --> 1403.90]  So,
[1403.90 --> 1405.46]  some of you probably
[1405.46 --> 1406.28]  don't remember
[1406.28 --> 1407.56]  or weren't around for this,
[1407.64 --> 1409.40]  but when I saw the pricing
[1409.40 --> 1410.68]  of the 40 series,
[1411.10 --> 1411.18]  Yeah.
[1411.36 --> 1413.54]  I made a solemn oath.
[1414.00 --> 1414.56]  I swore
[1414.56 --> 1415.94]  that I would not
[1415.94 --> 1417.18]  upgrade to it.
[1417.62 --> 1418.96]  I have kept
[1418.96 --> 1420.02]  that promise.
[1420.36 --> 1420.70]  Yeah.
[1420.92 --> 1421.88]  My VR machine
[1421.88 --> 1422.82]  is still running
[1422.82 --> 1423.86]  a launch 3080.
[1424.44 --> 1424.74]  Okay.
[1425.02 --> 1425.30]  Okay.
[1425.60 --> 1426.28]  My,
[1426.40 --> 1426.90]  uh,
[1426.90 --> 1427.62]  personal rig
[1427.62 --> 1428.66]  is still running
[1428.66 --> 1430.18]  the 7900 XTX
[1430.18 --> 1432.10]  from the Radeon Challenge,
[1432.10 --> 1433.36]  and my,
[1433.36 --> 1433.66]  like,
[1433.74 --> 1434.22]  LAN machine
[1434.22 --> 1435.04]  in the LAN room
[1435.04 --> 1436.50]  is still running
[1436.50 --> 1437.12]  a,
[1437.22 --> 1437.60]  um,
[1437.92 --> 1438.48]  uh,
[1438.52 --> 1439.22]  it's a,
[1439.22 --> 1440.38]  it's a 3080.
[1441.10 --> 1441.30]  Yeah,
[1441.36 --> 1441.52]  it's a,
[1441.56 --> 1442.98]  it's an EVGA 3080.
[1443.08 --> 1443.22]  So,
[1443.30 --> 1444.24]  is there a price point
[1444.24 --> 1444.56]  for this?
[1444.56 --> 1444.64]  No,
[1444.64 --> 1444.72]  no,
[1444.72 --> 1445.26]  I'm not done yet.
[1445.32 --> 1445.88]  I'm not done yet.
[1445.96 --> 1447.38]  I have an eGPU
[1447.38 --> 1448.58]  for my,
[1448.58 --> 1448.90]  uh,
[1448.96 --> 1450.72]  ROG Flow X13
[1450.72 --> 1452.56]  3080.
[1452.56 --> 1455.56]  my entire life.
[1455.64 --> 1456.70]  3000 series enjoyer.
[1456.96 --> 1458.62]  Is 3000 series
[1458.62 --> 1459.28]  and below
[1459.28 --> 1460.06]  for NVIDIA.
[1460.20 --> 1460.40]  Yeah.
[1460.52 --> 1461.60]  And then on the,
[1461.68 --> 1461.90]  oh yeah,
[1461.96 --> 1462.58]  technically I have
[1462.58 --> 1463.26]  one more machine.
[1463.46 --> 1464.48]  I have a little,
[1464.66 --> 1465.34]  remember those little
[1465.34 --> 1465.98]  ASRock,
[1466.06 --> 1466.24]  like,
[1466.36 --> 1467.12]  mini desktops?
[1467.30 --> 1467.84]  I think so.
[1468.00 --> 1468.18]  Yeah,
[1468.26 --> 1468.80]  with that used
[1468.80 --> 1469.76]  in MXM module?
[1469.88 --> 1470.18]  Yes.
[1470.34 --> 1470.56]  Okay,
[1470.60 --> 1471.44]  so I have one of those
[1471.44 --> 1472.68]  in my family room upstairs
[1472.68 --> 1473.22]  for just,
[1473.32 --> 1473.38]  like,
[1473.42 --> 1474.32]  playing casual games
[1474.32 --> 1474.96]  on the TV up,
[1475.08 --> 1475.48]  up there.
[1475.66 --> 1475.86]  Sure.
[1477.22 --> 1477.58]  1080.
[1478.82 --> 1479.22]  Still,
[1479.48 --> 1480.90]  still going strong.
[1480.90 --> 1482.84]  1080 gang represent.
[1483.64 --> 1484.00]  Um,
[1484.92 --> 1486.26]  so I have no
[1486.26 --> 1487.72]  40 series in my life.
[1488.06 --> 1489.06]  So with that said,
[1489.52 --> 1491.14]  I'm coming at this
[1491.14 --> 1492.76]  from an alternate angle.
[1493.02 --> 1494.32]  I have a different
[1494.32 --> 1495.02]  perspective
[1495.02 --> 1496.48]  on the 50 series
[1496.48 --> 1496.80]  because
[1496.80 --> 1498.32]  I've seen
[1498.32 --> 1499.36]  a lot of people,
[1499.36 --> 1499.78]  like,
[1499.94 --> 1500.90]  flip the math out
[1500.90 --> 1501.46]  going,
[1501.84 --> 1501.94]  well,
[1501.96 --> 1502.68]  this isn't worth it
[1502.68 --> 1503.24]  as an upgrade.
[1503.38 --> 1504.10]  They're asking way
[1504.10 --> 1504.70]  too much money.
[1505.20 --> 1506.44]  But my upgrade
[1506.44 --> 1507.90]  is from
[1507.90 --> 1509.82]  a 3080 class card
[1509.82 --> 1510.60]  or
[1510.60 --> 1511.56]  a 7900,
[1511.82 --> 1512.14]  which is,
[1512.22 --> 1512.80]  which is not
[1512.80 --> 1513.56]  on par with
[1513.56 --> 1514.64]  the 4090.
[1514.80 --> 1515.46]  It's more on par
[1515.46 --> 1515.68]  with,
[1515.82 --> 1515.88]  like,
[1515.90 --> 1516.98]  a 3090 Ti.
[1517.22 --> 1517.42]  Yeah.
[1517.60 --> 1517.76]  Right?
[1517.80 --> 1518.58]  If we're being honest.
[1518.70 --> 1518.84]  Sure.
[1518.90 --> 1519.68]  If we're being honest.
[1519.84 --> 1520.70]  Especially if you want
[1520.70 --> 1521.66]  to look at ray trace games,
[1521.70 --> 1522.18]  then it can even
[1522.18 --> 1523.08]  fall down below that.
[1523.32 --> 1524.04]  And ray tracing
[1524.04 --> 1524.88]  is now mandatory
[1524.88 --> 1526.26]  in some titles.
[1526.64 --> 1527.04]  Yes.
[1527.10 --> 1527.22]  No,
[1527.28 --> 1527.52]  that's,
[1527.60 --> 1528.30]  that's true.
[1528.52 --> 1528.96]  Tomb Raider.
[1529.36 --> 1529.98]  Or not Tomb Raider.
[1530.56 --> 1530.76]  Well,
[1531.14 --> 1531.96]  guy Tomb Raider.
[1532.06 --> 1532.24]  Yeah.
[1532.82 --> 1533.74]  Nostalgia Tomb Raider.
[1534.12 --> 1534.80]  There we go.
[1534.94 --> 1535.04]  Yeah.
[1537.46 --> 1538.46]  Donates to a museum
[1538.46 --> 1538.94]  Tomb Raider.
[1539.06 --> 1539.92]  Great looking game,
[1539.98 --> 1540.40]  by the way.
[1540.60 --> 1541.40]  Have you played
[1541.40 --> 1542.40]  Great Circle yet?
[1542.44 --> 1542.58]  Oh,
[1542.60 --> 1542.74]  okay.
[1543.06 --> 1543.38]  Oh my,
[1543.46 --> 1544.28]  it's so beautiful.
[1544.52 --> 1544.68]  Nice.
[1544.74 --> 1545.76]  It looks incredible.
[1545.88 --> 1546.70]  Worth the requirement?
[1546.92 --> 1547.40]  Well,
[1547.56 --> 1547.70]  that,
[1548.06 --> 1551.02]  more complicated discussion.
[1551.10 --> 1552.42]  No more spicy takes this week.
[1552.42 --> 1553.46]  More complicated discussion,
[1553.56 --> 1553.74]  yeah.
[1553.74 --> 1555.94]  So,
[1555.94 --> 1555.96]  so,
[1555.96 --> 1555.98]  so,
[1555.98 --> 1557.40]  my upgrade
[1557.40 --> 1558.76]  is much greater
[1558.76 --> 1560.36]  and
[1560.36 --> 1562.64]  my amenability
[1562.64 --> 1563.70]  to spending
[1563.70 --> 1564.70]  way too much money
[1564.70 --> 1565.86]  is much higher
[1565.86 --> 1567.08]  because I got
[1567.08 --> 1568.90]  three good years
[1568.90 --> 1569.58]  Skip to Jen.
[1569.66 --> 1570.64]  out of my 3080.
[1570.84 --> 1571.12]  Okay.
[1572.48 --> 1572.70]  So,
[1572.78 --> 1573.62]  is there still a limit?
[1573.62 --> 1578.56]  I'm afraid to say anything
[1578.56 --> 1580.26]  because I really want one
[1580.26 --> 1583.08]  and if I say something
[1583.08 --> 1584.02]  And you want a 4090?
[1584.22 --> 1584.92]  If I say,
[1584.92 --> 1586.58]  if I say,
[1586.70 --> 1587.44]  guys,
[1587.50 --> 1588.94]  if it's over this price,
[1589.08 --> 1591.04]  then I'm going to skip this generation.
[1591.36 --> 1592.32]  I'd still be on 3000.
[1592.32 --> 1594.00]  Then I'm going to be stuck on 3000
[1594.00 --> 1594.90]  for another like
[1594.90 --> 1595.50]  five years.
[1595.64 --> 1596.40]  Three more years.
[1596.56 --> 1597.30]  Five total years.
[1597.46 --> 1597.60]  Yeah.
[1597.68 --> 1599.52]  And then 6090,
[1600.00 --> 1600.62]  nice,
[1600.84 --> 1601.86]  is going to arrive
[1601.86 --> 1604.28]  and it's going to be like
[1604.28 --> 1605.18]  $4,000
[1605.18 --> 1606.96]  and I'm going to be like,
[1607.48 --> 1609.54]  and if it's over $3,800,
[1609.98 --> 1610.50]  I'm not buying it.
[1610.60 --> 1612.48]  And I'm going to be running a 3080 forever.
[1615.10 --> 1615.78]  Oh man.
[1616.16 --> 1616.48]  Maybe,
[1616.60 --> 1617.78]  maybe at that point,
[1618.22 --> 1619.90]  Intel will be so good
[1619.90 --> 1621.24]  that you'll be fine.
[1622.32 --> 1624.12]  That's a lot of years from now.
[1624.34 --> 1625.32]  6,000 series.
[1626.56 --> 1627.34]  Massive respect
[1627.34 --> 1628.74]  to what Intel has done
[1628.74 --> 1629.56]  with Arc BattleMage.
[1629.58 --> 1630.28]  You've got a lot of work.
[1630.66 --> 1631.14]  Massive,
[1631.28 --> 1633.00]  massive respect.
[1633.44 --> 1633.64]  And,
[1633.72 --> 1634.06]  and,
[1634.32 --> 1634.80]  and
[1634.80 --> 1636.80]  they're catching up to NVIDIA
[1636.80 --> 1638.10]  in the ways that I think
[1638.10 --> 1639.76]  matter more for the future.
[1640.16 --> 1640.62]  That makes sense.
[1640.64 --> 1641.96]  So they're still,
[1642.54 --> 1643.36]  when we look at
[1643.36 --> 1645.48]  die size to die size comparisons,
[1646.32 --> 1647.76]  they're behind on raster.
[1648.04 --> 1649.94]  When we look at performance per watt,
[1650.20 --> 1650.40]  dude,
[1650.92 --> 1651.54]  they're behind.
[1651.54 --> 1653.06]  But when we look
[1653.06 --> 1654.48]  at what Intel is doing
[1654.48 --> 1655.54]  on the software side,
[1655.70 --> 1656.86]  their driver team
[1656.86 --> 1657.76]  is doing the work
[1657.76 --> 1658.72]  on the tech side.
[1658.96 --> 1659.86]  Their AI performance,
[1659.98 --> 1661.02]  even though the support for it
[1661.02 --> 1661.78]  is not great yet,
[1662.24 --> 1662.56]  good.
[1662.80 --> 1663.00]  Yeah.
[1663.22 --> 1664.56]  Their ray tracing performance,
[1665.02 --> 1665.34]  good.
[1665.42 --> 1665.54]  Yeah,
[1665.54 --> 1666.48]  they're very forward thinking.
[1666.66 --> 1666.92]  Yes.
[1667.00 --> 1667.18]  Which is good.
[1667.40 --> 1667.66]  Yes.
[1667.74 --> 1668.02]  So,
[1668.14 --> 1669.16]  so all that's great,
[1669.64 --> 1670.74]  but let's face it,
[1670.82 --> 1672.24]  they are not going to have
[1672.24 --> 1673.56]  a 5090 competitor.
[1673.56 --> 1674.52]  They may not have
[1674.52 --> 1675.72]  a 6090 competitor.
[1675.90 --> 1676.40]  They just got to release
[1676.40 --> 1678.72]  an SLI competitor.
[1678.72 --> 1679.02]  All right,
[1679.02 --> 1679.26]  enough.
[1679.38 --> 1680.30]  And then just put like
[1680.30 --> 1681.00]  four of them in.
[1681.40 --> 1681.72]  Although,
[1682.12 --> 1683.12]  let them virtualize them.
[1683.20 --> 1684.02]  We do need a reason
[1684.02 --> 1685.62]  for PCIe Gen 6.
[1685.84 --> 1686.02]  Yeah,
[1686.24 --> 1686.92]  let's do it.
[1688.20 --> 1688.60]  Okay,
[1688.72 --> 1688.86]  no,
[1688.90 --> 1689.00]  no,
[1689.00 --> 1689.18]  no,
[1689.18 --> 1689.32]  no,
[1689.32 --> 1689.48]  no,
[1689.48 --> 1689.70]  no,
[1689.70 --> 1689.86]  no,
[1689.86 --> 1690.12]  no.
[1690.18 --> 1691.14]  But I think for,
[1691.28 --> 1691.82]  I think at the,
[1691.88 --> 1692.88]  at mainstream price points,
[1692.88 --> 1693.20]  I,
[1693.20 --> 1693.40]  I,
[1693.48 --> 1695.52]  I hope Intel is going to just
[1695.52 --> 1696.78]  crush it.
[1696.88 --> 1698.58]  Just give us a,
[1698.68 --> 1699.08]  give us a,
[1699.08 --> 1700.30]  we'll see how rough
[1700.30 --> 1701.04]  50,
[1701.16 --> 1702.66]  60 coming out is.
[1702.80 --> 1703.10]  Okay.
[1703.54 --> 1704.42]  Whenever that happens.
[1705.06 --> 1705.18]  I,
[1705.36 --> 1705.48]  the,
[1705.58 --> 1707.44]  the price I've seen rumored
[1707.44 --> 1709.10]  is two grand.
[1709.74 --> 1710.50]  U.S.
[1714.12 --> 1714.60]  Yeah.
[1715.36 --> 1717.58]  That's the price that I've seen rumored,
[1717.66 --> 1718.84]  but that goes back far.
[1719.06 --> 1719.86]  Like I haven't seen,
[1719.96 --> 1720.08]  I,
[1720.20 --> 1721.80]  I intentionally don't really
[1721.80 --> 1723.22]  follow the rumors that closely
[1723.22 --> 1724.94]  in the lead up to a product launch
[1724.94 --> 1725.78]  because realistically,
[1725.78 --> 1727.30]  I'm going to get briefed on it anyway.
[1727.54 --> 1730.08]  And that will be the real information anyway.
[1730.22 --> 1730.58]  Right now,
[1730.62 --> 1732.44]  isn't that like 2,800 CAD?
[1732.44 --> 1733.16]  Yeah.
[1733.30 --> 1733.62]  More.
[1734.24 --> 1734.62]  It's,
[1734.62 --> 1737.32]  it's probably more like 2,900 Canadian dollars.
[1737.70 --> 1737.88]  Yeah.
[1738.46 --> 1739.78]  2,000 USD CAD.
[1740.80 --> 1741.60]  And I think what,
[1741.72 --> 1742.06]  Oh yeah,
[1742.18 --> 1743.20]  2,884.
[1743.34 --> 1743.98]  What's median,
[1744.16 --> 1745.42]  what's median income these days?
[1745.46 --> 1747.54]  Like 38,000 or something like that.
[1748.02 --> 1748.80]  Median income,
[1749.24 --> 1750.18]  Canadian.
[1750.70 --> 1752.04]  Oh my goodness.
[1752.04 --> 1752.36]  Actually,
[1752.72 --> 1752.96]  oh wait,
[1752.98 --> 1753.62]  is this household?
[1754.32 --> 1755.24]  Median income,
[1755.92 --> 1757.48]  hold on.
[1758.92 --> 1760.54]  Median income was
[1760.54 --> 1762.20]  41,700
[1762.20 --> 1764.34]  in 2022.
[1767.00 --> 1767.44]  Yeah.
[1767.62 --> 1769.52]  So here's my source.
[1769.72 --> 1770.60]  Wowwood.ca.
[1770.70 --> 1771.74]  I have no idea how,
[1771.82 --> 1773.94]  I have no idea how accurate that is or anything,
[1773.94 --> 1774.50]  but like,
[1774.78 --> 1775.64]  we are basically,
[1775.64 --> 1778.38]  we are basically looking at like a 10th
[1778.38 --> 1779.76]  of your take home
[1779.76 --> 1782.16]  by the time you actually like get taxed on that and stuff.
[1782.40 --> 1782.58]  Yeah.
[1783.54 --> 1784.46]  The tariffs guys,
[1784.56 --> 1785.66]  the tariffs wouldn't be from China.
[1785.66 --> 1786.56]  They'd be from Taiwan.
[1788.66 --> 1789.32]  Which ones?
[1789.80 --> 1790.38]  People are like,
[1790.44 --> 1790.56]  Oh,
[1790.60 --> 1792.10]  you have to factor in tariffs now.
[1792.48 --> 1792.82]  No,
[1792.92 --> 1793.02]  you,
[1793.12 --> 1794.06]  we could end up,
[1794.20 --> 1794.46]  I,
[1794.46 --> 1794.72]  I,
[1794.80 --> 1795.60]  I doubt it.
[1796.24 --> 1798.08]  But that would only be for the States anyway.
[1798.62 --> 1799.34]  For Canada,
[1799.52 --> 1799.66]  I,
[1799.66 --> 1805.02]  I doubt that we would be paying any kind of import tariffs on Chinese export GPUs.
[1805.02 --> 1807.84]  They're going to start smuggling GPUs over the board.
[1807.86 --> 1807.98]  Yeah.
[1808.04 --> 1809.84]  The GPUs themselves are made in Taiwan,
[1810.06 --> 1812.02]  but a lot of the card assembly is done in China.
[1812.18 --> 1816.18]  So the finished GPU would probably be subject to any Chinese tariffs,
[1816.32 --> 1816.48]  but,
[1816.54 --> 1819.90]  but that's all speculative until after January sometime.
[1820.62 --> 1824.48]  So for the sake of discussion.
[1825.16 --> 1825.64]  Yeah.
[1826.20 --> 1826.50]  Two
[1826.50 --> 1828.42]  thousand
[1828.42 --> 1830.02]  USD.
[1831.22 --> 1832.10]  That's too much.
[1832.60 --> 1833.56]  I'm going to do it.
[1833.56 --> 1836.74]  What if it's 2200?
[1837.88 --> 1838.28]  Stop.
[1838.70 --> 1838.88]  What?
[1839.84 --> 1841.78]  I'm not going to let you pin me down on this.
[1841.86 --> 1842.34]  I'm not going to,
[1842.36 --> 1842.48]  no,
[1842.56 --> 1843.90]  I'm not going to commit to anything.
[1844.68 --> 1846.24]  I'm not going to commit to anything.
[1847.24 --> 1847.54]  I just,
[1847.66 --> 1848.96]  you don't have to vocalize it.
[1849.72 --> 1850.68]  Is there a limit?
[1851.18 --> 1854.50]  You don't have to tell anyone just in case you want to get out of it or whatever.
[1854.50 --> 1856.12]  Is there a point where you would be like,
[1856.12 --> 1857.34]  Is there a soft limit right now?
[1857.84 --> 1859.18]  I don't want to open my wallet.
[1859.18 --> 1860.06]  Because you're going to like,
[1860.18 --> 1860.94]  for context,
[1861.10 --> 1862.04]  he's not going to buy one.
[1862.36 --> 1862.50]  No,
[1862.52 --> 1862.60]  no,
[1862.64 --> 1862.88]  I will.
[1864.04 --> 1864.80]  I'll buy one.
[1865.24 --> 1865.60]  Okay.
[1866.08 --> 1866.52]  Look,
[1866.64 --> 1867.96]  if I'm going to say,
[1868.18 --> 1870.04]  I accept this madness.
[1870.92 --> 1871.86]  I can't just,
[1871.96 --> 1874.34]  I can't just use my influencer clout to be like,
[1874.78 --> 1876.48]  to summon one.
[1876.68 --> 1877.00]  I don't,
[1877.08 --> 1878.06]  I don't think that's right.
[1878.20 --> 1878.38]  Yeah.
[1878.46 --> 1881.08]  Because I took a principled stand on 40 series.
[1881.18 --> 1881.50]  I was like,
[1881.52 --> 1882.34]  this is too expensive.
[1882.64 --> 1883.96]  I won't even use it.
[1884.28 --> 1885.50]  But if I'm going to break that,
[1885.66 --> 1887.00]  I think I have to pay for it.
[1887.00 --> 1892.20]  Going from 1600 to two grand in one generation doesn't deserve a principled stand.
[1893.20 --> 1893.48]  Luke,
[1893.80 --> 1896.34]  what GPU do you run?
[1898.04 --> 1899.20]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1899.56 --> 1899.86]  Uh-huh.
[1900.20 --> 1900.88]  What is it?
[1901.08 --> 1902.02]  I know what it is.
[1902.02 --> 1902.92]  It's pretty good.
[1903.04 --> 1903.26]  Yeah?
[1903.56 --> 1904.02]  What is it?
[1904.08 --> 1904.58]  It's pretty good.
[1904.58 --> 1904.88]  Well,
[1904.92 --> 1905.86]  if you want to see it,
[1905.92 --> 1907.18]  you should check out the,
[1907.18 --> 1907.90]  uh,
[1908.00 --> 1909.14]  the Linus Actives video,
[1909.14 --> 1910.10]  uh,
[1910.14 --> 1910.98]  on Bulbasaur.
[1911.04 --> 1911.16]  See,
[1911.20 --> 1911.94]  I have no problem.
[1912.14 --> 1913.26]  I have no problem.
[1913.54 --> 1914.62]  I have no problem gifting,
[1915.02 --> 1915.34]  you know,
[1915.42 --> 1916.76]  a 40 series to someone.
[1916.88 --> 1917.26]  That's,
[1917.32 --> 1918.22]  that's no problem.
[1918.42 --> 1919.44]  I didn't need to get involved.
[1919.62 --> 1920.24]  I just wouldn't.
[1920.32 --> 1920.68]  Yeah.
[1921.00 --> 1922.26]  I just wouldn't buy one.
[1922.36 --> 1922.88]  I just,
[1922.98 --> 1923.14]  I,
[1923.14 --> 1923.72]  I wouldn't,
[1923.78 --> 1925.06]  I wouldn't buy a 40 series.
[1925.06 --> 1925.68]  And so,
[1925.88 --> 1929.22]  because I didn't want to hack and just request one,
[1929.32 --> 1930.92]  then I was like,
[1930.92 --> 1931.08]  okay,
[1931.14 --> 1931.90]  I wouldn't even use them.
[1932.70 --> 1932.90]  Yeah.
[1932.94 --> 1934.34]  He actually didn't request one.
[1935.26 --> 1935.74]  I mean,
[1935.74 --> 1936.86]  he did hint to someone.
[1936.96 --> 1937.02]  Oh,
[1937.04 --> 1937.90]  I thought you were bringing up the video.
[1938.02 --> 1938.22]  He did.
[1938.22 --> 1938.24]  Oh,
[1938.24 --> 1938.62]  it was,
[1938.68 --> 1938.94]  it was.
[1939.00 --> 1940.58]  I just didn't know you were doing that.
[1940.82 --> 1941.30]  Let me bring it back.
[1941.30 --> 1943.78]  He did hint to someone that he kind of wanted an upgrade or something,
[1943.86 --> 1944.14]  I think.
[1944.94 --> 1945.36]  Or maybe,
[1945.46 --> 1945.56]  no,
[1945.62 --> 1946.44]  maybe Jake's idea.
[1946.58 --> 1947.68]  I think it was Jake's idea.
[1948.68 --> 1949.04]  Um,
[1949.08 --> 1949.44]  anyway,
[1950.74 --> 1951.50]  let me make,
[1952.22 --> 1952.92]  let me make,
[1953.22 --> 1956.64]  at risk of being called an advocate for the devil himself,
[1957.86 --> 1961.42]  let me make an argument for my $2,000 GPU.
[1962.80 --> 1963.24]  Okay.
[1963.76 --> 1964.12]  Okay.
[1964.72 --> 1964.98]  Uh,
[1964.98 --> 1965.14]  I'm,
[1965.20 --> 1965.38]  hold on.
[1965.40 --> 1966.28]  I'm going to find something.
[1967.90 --> 1968.34]  Um,
[1968.58 --> 1969.42]  cause to be fair,
[1969.48 --> 1974.20]  that's like really close to the current cost of my current car.
[1975.10 --> 1975.54]  Yeah.
[1975.74 --> 1977.12]  I used to talk about like,
[1977.14 --> 1977.30]  you know,
[1977.30 --> 1979.30]  the first car that I bought as a,
[1979.34 --> 1981.08]  as a scale for computer parts.
[1981.46 --> 1981.90]  Uh,
[1981.90 --> 1983.94]  now it has to be the one that I drove here today.
[1983.94 --> 1988.98]  which is crazy.
[1992.68 --> 1993.28]  You can,
[1993.38 --> 1998.94]  you can buy something that literally gets you from A to B instead of something that like digitally gets you from A to B.
[1998.94 --> 2000.54]  when I was growing up,
[2000.54 --> 2004.30]  a computer set up at future shop.
[2004.52 --> 2005.02]  Okay.
[2005.58 --> 2006.10]  Okay.
[2007.22 --> 2007.90]  Hold on.
[2007.98 --> 2008.34]  So,
[2008.40 --> 2009.52]  you know where I'm going with this,
[2009.52 --> 2010.74]  but hold on.
[2010.96 --> 2018.42]  A computer set up from future shop would have probably cost you somewhere in the neighborhood of $2,500 to $4,400.
[2019.82 --> 2020.26]  Okay.
[2020.50 --> 2020.74]  Right.
[2020.74 --> 2023.64]  That was in like $1998.
[2024.18 --> 2024.32]  Yeah.
[2025.04 --> 2025.56]  Um,
[2025.64 --> 2028.28]  and they could have easily gone more like easily.
[2028.28 --> 2030.14]  You could spend five grand on,
[2030.24 --> 2031.30]  on a computer on a,
[2031.30 --> 2033.32]  on a personal computer as they called them back then.
[2034.80 --> 2038.32]  I would make the argument that like TVs,
[2039.92 --> 2040.30]  PCs,
[2040.78 --> 2045.76]  in spite of some of the utter craziness of the last few years,
[2045.76 --> 2048.00]  have actually beaten inflation.
[2048.00 --> 2053.60]  you can still get for like $4,000,
[2054.40 --> 2056.16]  a computer tower.
[2056.38 --> 2061.14]  And the fact that it can contain something as powerful as a 4090,
[2061.62 --> 2063.06]  actually kind of impressive,
[2063.84 --> 2064.66]  kind of cool.
[2065.44 --> 2069.44]  It is not that wild to spend three,
[2069.62 --> 2069.90]  four,
[2070.14 --> 2072.24]  five grand on a PC once every,
[2072.46 --> 2073.10]  you know,
[2073.14 --> 2074.10]  five to six years.
[2074.20 --> 2074.86]  It's pretty wild.
[2075.28 --> 2075.48]  And,
[2075.72 --> 2075.88]  but,
[2076.00 --> 2077.16]  but it's not,
[2077.16 --> 2077.90]  it's not,
[2078.48 --> 2079.98]  it's also not wild.
[2080.10 --> 2080.58]  Like it's,
[2080.64 --> 2082.86]  it's a thing that when I grew up was normal,
[2083.00 --> 2083.56]  every family.
[2083.56 --> 2084.76]  But when tech scales,
[2084.88 --> 2086.66]  you don't have to keep spending the same amount.
[2086.76 --> 2086.86]  No,
[2086.90 --> 2087.66]  you don't,
[2087.74 --> 2088.42]  but you also can.
[2088.60 --> 2089.56]  And you can get,
[2089.74 --> 2094.84]  you can get a PC that is vastly more powerful than that 1998 machine for 500 bucks.
[2095.14 --> 2095.38]  Yeah.
[2095.80 --> 2097.20]  So you absolutely don't have to,
[2097.74 --> 2098.64]  but I also think,
[2098.74 --> 2099.06]  you get a cell phone.
[2099.06 --> 2101.90]  I also think that for something that is,
[2102.00 --> 2108.26]  that is a purchase that you will use for an extended period of time and that you will get much,
[2108.32 --> 2108.44]  much,
[2108.50 --> 2108.64]  much,
[2108.64 --> 2108.86]  much,
[2108.86 --> 2109.98]  much use out of,
[2110.46 --> 2112.74]  it is not entirely unreasonable.
[2112.74 --> 2115.50]  I don't know if you're going to get that much use out of it.
[2116.80 --> 2117.14]  Yeah,
[2117.14 --> 2117.56]  that's fair.
[2118.18 --> 2118.64]  I don't,
[2118.68 --> 2120.02]  I don't really get to gain that much.
[2120.76 --> 2121.08]  However,
[2121.08 --> 2122.26]  I feel like it's like,
[2122.46 --> 2122.86]  however,
[2123.06 --> 2123.80]  on your ally.
[2124.06 --> 2124.40]  However,
[2124.40 --> 2132.02]  which of us is further into our playthrough of the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy VI,
[2132.14 --> 2132.62]  you or me?
[2132.98 --> 2133.34]  Wait,
[2133.36 --> 2134.08]  are you playing it?
[2135.04 --> 2135.80]  It's on sale.
[2135.90 --> 2136.32]  I picked it up.
[2136.42 --> 2136.88]  Oh no,
[2137.02 --> 2138.06]  he's going to beat me.
[2140.56 --> 2142.12]  I said I was going to play it this week,
[2142.20 --> 2145.86]  but I had actually a very busy week and I had no time.
[2146.44 --> 2147.46]  Speaking of my ally.
[2148.08 --> 2148.84]  Oh boy.
[2149.54 --> 2150.22]  Where are you at?
[2150.86 --> 2151.12]  Well,
[2151.14 --> 2151.72]  let's just see.
[2151.84 --> 2154.00]  Why don't we just see if you recognize where I am?
[2154.40 --> 2155.88]  Because part of the problem is that he,
[2155.88 --> 2156.58]  he quote unquote,
[2156.66 --> 2157.74]  doesn't have any time to play games,
[2157.84 --> 2160.70]  but then you'll see him jump on a game on steam at like midnight.
[2161.24 --> 2161.78]  And it's like,
[2161.80 --> 2161.88]  oh,
[2161.88 --> 2162.54]  I wonder what he's doing.
[2162.60 --> 2162.84]  But then,
[2162.88 --> 2163.06]  you know,
[2163.08 --> 2166.64]  it's not on his computer that he would have spent all these thousands of dollars on.
[2166.98 --> 2168.10]  I could stream it.
[2170.56 --> 2170.88]  Wrecked.
[2170.90 --> 2171.46]  On the ally?
[2171.72 --> 2171.86]  Yeah,
[2171.86 --> 2172.14]  of course.
[2173.94 --> 2175.00]  Is there a camera on the ally?
[2175.30 --> 2175.52]  What?
[2175.70 --> 2175.84]  No,
[2175.86 --> 2175.96]  no,
[2175.96 --> 2176.06]  no,
[2176.06 --> 2176.96]  not that kind of streaming.
[2176.98 --> 2177.62]  So you're just going to like,
[2177.96 --> 2178.42]  oh,
[2178.74 --> 2181.92]  why would you stream the pixel remaster?
[2182.34 --> 2184.36]  So I could get like 9,000 FPS.
[2184.58 --> 2184.86]  Who cares?
[2185.20 --> 2186.04]  Don't worry about it.
[2186.66 --> 2187.02]  Okay,
[2187.08 --> 2188.12]  so here's what we're going to do.
[2188.26 --> 2188.68]  Here's what we're going to,
[2188.72 --> 2190.04]  we're going to play a little game called.
[2190.44 --> 2191.60]  Do I know where you are?
[2191.68 --> 2193.04]  Do you recognize where I am?
[2193.96 --> 2194.24]  No.
[2194.54 --> 2194.92]  All right.
[2197.48 --> 2199.38]  So you've had it for like a couple of days?
[2199.52 --> 2199.88]  QED.
[2202.44 --> 2202.80]  All right,
[2202.82 --> 2202.94]  well,
[2202.94 --> 2203.74]  you're going on a trip.
[2203.90 --> 2204.98]  Are you going to play it on your trip?
[2205.24 --> 2205.48]  Yep.
[2205.80 --> 2206.22]  Darn it.
[2207.96 --> 2208.64]  Where are you at?
[2208.68 --> 2211.50]  Are you still at the Imperial Magitek facility?
[2212.02 --> 2212.20]  No,
[2212.26 --> 2212.72]  I'm past that.
[2212.82 --> 2213.34]  You're past that?
[2213.42 --> 2213.58]  Yeah.
[2213.70 --> 2213.88]  Oh,
[2213.92 --> 2214.08]  okay.
[2214.14 --> 2215.42]  Are you at the sealed gate?
[2217.94 --> 2218.54]  Past that,
[2218.60 --> 2219.02]  I believe.
[2219.54 --> 2220.60]  So you've had the banquet?
[2223.68 --> 2224.08]  No,
[2224.58 --> 2225.34]  I don't think.
[2225.34 --> 2226.68]  So you're probably somewhere,
[2226.84 --> 2228.44]  somewhere in that neighborhood.
[2228.68 --> 2228.88]  Yeah.
[2229.16 --> 2229.46]  Okay.
[2229.60 --> 2229.76]  Well,
[2229.78 --> 2230.96]  I'm not going to spoil anything.
[2231.12 --> 2232.28]  Not going to spoil anything.
[2234.40 --> 2235.46]  I will say though,
[2235.46 --> 2238.80]  that if I feel like treating myself to a nice gaming PC,
[2239.30 --> 2241.82]  I think that unlike some people,
[2241.82 --> 2243.92]  I can complete a game in a year.
[2244.30 --> 2246.26]  So I should be entitled to do that.
[2246.96 --> 2249.40]  I wanted to do it this holiday season.
[2249.42 --> 2250.94]  I was so ready for you to tell me I don't game.
[2251.06 --> 2252.26]  I was so ready to do it.
[2252.26 --> 2257.62]  My brother spun up a family holiday Valheim server.
[2258.28 --> 2259.14]  So we've been playing together.
[2259.24 --> 2259.60]  My brother,
[2259.70 --> 2260.10]  my dad,
[2260.34 --> 2261.10]  and sometimes Emma.
[2261.80 --> 2266.28]  So that took the time that I thought I was going to spend playing Final Fantasy VI.
[2266.76 --> 2267.60]  That's pretty cool though.
[2267.60 --> 2268.52]  That seemed fair.
[2268.64 --> 2269.38]  I respect it.
[2269.38 --> 2270.60]  I'm still going to try it.
[2270.68 --> 2272.38]  Now that I know you're on the track,
[2272.50 --> 2273.74]  I'm still going to try to get it out.
[2273.90 --> 2274.24]  All right.
[2274.28 --> 2275.04]  Get it finished pretty quick.
[2275.12 --> 2275.36]  All right.
[2275.38 --> 2275.80]  Let's go.
[2276.18 --> 2276.54]  Let's go.
[2276.54 --> 2280.48]  I've spent a lot of time like dinking around doing stuff I totally don't need to do.
[2280.68 --> 2281.60]  I will say this though.
[2281.64 --> 2284.00]  The Pixel Remaster is easy.
[2284.50 --> 2284.80]  Oh.
[2285.12 --> 2285.44]  Oh,
[2285.78 --> 2286.00]  dude.
[2286.04 --> 2286.22]  Okay.
[2286.26 --> 2287.16]  That makes sense.
[2287.22 --> 2289.46]  It is so easy.
[2289.60 --> 2292.80]  Because I've heard you talk and I've heard a lot of other people talk about like needing
[2292.80 --> 2296.46]  to grind a bunch and stuff and certain fights that you're like,
[2296.54 --> 2296.60]  oh,
[2296.62 --> 2297.38]  this is really hard.
[2297.40 --> 2298.06]  And then I went and did it.
[2298.10 --> 2298.32]  I was like,
[2298.36 --> 2300.00]  I don't think I did anything special.
[2300.26 --> 2300.44]  Dude.
[2300.56 --> 2301.36]  It wasn't hard.
[2301.54 --> 2303.20]  It's like a joke.
[2303.44 --> 2303.70]  Okay.
[2303.74 --> 2305.02]  So they difficulty tuned it.
[2305.38 --> 2306.08]  Laughably easy.
[2306.08 --> 2306.44]  Okay.
[2306.60 --> 2306.74]  Well,
[2306.80 --> 2307.58]  it's not just like,
[2307.66 --> 2309.38]  it's not just difficulty tuned.
[2309.50 --> 2313.66]  It's like certain things were broken in the original game.
[2314.00 --> 2316.16]  The evade stat literally didn't work.
[2316.22 --> 2316.54]  Okay.
[2317.44 --> 2320.42]  So you like always got hit,
[2320.96 --> 2322.16]  but would miss a lot.
[2322.32 --> 2323.06]  And it was real,
[2323.18 --> 2324.10]  real frustrate.
[2325.10 --> 2326.78]  Also the ability to,
[2326.88 --> 2330.02]  to just turn off random encounters while you find your way through something.
[2330.18 --> 2331.22]  Like I,
[2331.46 --> 2332.24]  I didn't do that.
[2332.24 --> 2332.58]  I,
[2332.74 --> 2333.60]  to this day,
[2333.60 --> 2337.26]  didn't realize how small some of the dungeons were.
[2337.54 --> 2341.80]  Because when you're getting into random encounter every three steps,
[2341.98 --> 2344.46]  they feel huge.
[2344.70 --> 2344.88]  Yeah.
[2344.88 --> 2346.14]  They feel enormous.
[2346.34 --> 2348.22]  Like you could never navigate them.
[2348.22 --> 2354.62]  That almost feels like some of the difficulty sometimes is the like time between potential rest areas.
[2355.18 --> 2356.80]  So being able to turn that off.
[2356.90 --> 2357.04]  Oh,
[2357.14 --> 2357.30]  dude.
[2357.36 --> 2357.68]  And the,
[2357.74 --> 2358.94]  the way the saving works,
[2359.02 --> 2360.04]  it has like quick save.
[2360.18 --> 2360.36]  Yeah.
[2360.48 --> 2360.74]  Oh,
[2361.14 --> 2361.34]  dude,
[2361.40 --> 2363.12]  the game didn't have quick save.
[2363.52 --> 2365.92]  You went back to the last like star.
[2365.92 --> 2367.42]  Those stars were like,
[2367.42 --> 2371.66]  will there be one more random encounter before I get there?
[2371.76 --> 2372.04]  Ah,
[2372.32 --> 2374.82]  like it was a huge deal.
[2375.78 --> 2376.60]  And like,
[2376.94 --> 2377.26]  dude,
[2377.60 --> 2378.64]  the map,
[2378.76 --> 2381.70]  I've definitely been using the map marks the chocobo stables.
[2383.52 --> 2384.04]  Yeah.
[2384.20 --> 2385.20]  Those weren't on the map.
[2386.30 --> 2386.82]  Well,
[2386.88 --> 2387.66]  aren't they in the player?
[2387.86 --> 2388.04]  No.
[2388.24 --> 2388.62]  Okay.
[2388.80 --> 2389.78]  I don't think so.
[2390.32 --> 2390.78]  Hold on.
[2390.86 --> 2391.32]  Hold on.
[2392.12 --> 2394.40]  Final Fantasy three included map.
[2394.40 --> 2395.98]  North America.
[2396.14 --> 2397.26]  I don't think so though.
[2397.68 --> 2399.62]  Like you definitely would have been able to get,
[2399.82 --> 2400.78]  um,
[2401.24 --> 2402.24]  here,
[2402.40 --> 2402.72]  here's one.
[2402.96 --> 2405.02]  You definitely would have been able to get like a,
[2405.02 --> 2405.64]  like a,
[2405.64 --> 2406.00]  a,
[2406.00 --> 2408.70]  a strategy guide or whatever back in the day.
[2408.70 --> 2408.76]  Right.
[2408.88 --> 2409.18]  Yeah.
[2409.96 --> 2410.48]  Um,
[2410.56 --> 2411.00]  but no.
[2412.06 --> 2412.54]  Yeah.
[2412.80 --> 2413.58]  So like,
[2413.58 --> 2418.74]  so traversing ground was like tough.
[2419.00 --> 2419.16]  Yeah.
[2419.36 --> 2423.36]  If you didn't like have a friend who knew where they were or whatever,
[2423.82 --> 2424.32]  right?
[2424.32 --> 2424.98]  Like it was,
[2425.16 --> 2426.54]  I didn't turn off random encounters.
[2426.76 --> 2428.20]  I have never bought a chocobo.
[2428.62 --> 2429.02]  Oh,
[2429.06 --> 2429.28]  you don't,
[2429.38 --> 2431.28]  you don't have to buy them or rent it or whatever.
[2431.42 --> 2431.58]  Oh,
[2431.80 --> 2431.96]  Oh,
[2431.96 --> 2432.22]  okay.
[2432.40 --> 2432.62]  Yeah.
[2432.64 --> 2432.90]  Okay.
[2433.54 --> 2433.96]  Um,
[2433.96 --> 2434.36]  you definitely,
[2434.50 --> 2434.58]  Oh,
[2434.64 --> 2434.82]  being,
[2434.96 --> 2435.32]  Oh dude,
[2435.46 --> 2436.98]  being able to walk diagonally.
[2437.80 --> 2438.38]  I do.
[2438.56 --> 2439.02]  I do that.
[2439.26 --> 2439.38]  Huge.
[2439.54 --> 2439.80]  Yeah.
[2440.04 --> 2440.42]  Huge.
[2440.50 --> 2443.20]  Cause that's literally one step,
[2443.20 --> 2444.82]  one step for two.
[2444.92 --> 2445.22]  Yeah.
[2445.66 --> 2446.06]  Um,
[2446.18 --> 2446.46]  Oh,
[2446.46 --> 2446.88]  what's a,
[2446.96 --> 2447.54]  what's another big one?
[2447.58 --> 2447.78]  Oh yeah.
[2447.78 --> 2449.64]  The fact that you have sprint shoes always equipped,
[2449.64 --> 2452.98]  you had to use a relic slot to be able to walk fast.
[2453.36 --> 2453.50]  Oh,
[2453.82 --> 2455.74]  and you couldn't walk fast outside of towns.
[2456.34 --> 2457.40]  Oh yeah.
[2457.70 --> 2461.02]  So like hiking was tedious.
[2461.02 --> 2461.80]  Like there's,
[2461.86 --> 2464.26]  there's a lot that they've done to make,
[2464.34 --> 2464.56]  Oh,
[2464.88 --> 2469.50]  the explanations for like what equipment does and what espers do and stuff has been,
[2469.64 --> 2472.56]  I find some of that to still be weird has been upgraded,
[2472.56 --> 2475.26]  but the interface for equipping espers is actually worse.
[2475.64 --> 2478.20]  I did it once and couldn't find it again.
[2478.20 --> 2482.70]  The next time I went to play the OG interface is so much better.
[2482.70 --> 2483.22]  Um,
[2483.22 --> 2484.72]  actually for espers and seeing,
[2484.88 --> 2487.32]  seeing all the spells they teach and also the,
[2487.40 --> 2487.80]  um,
[2488.12 --> 2490.18]  the level up stat boosts that they give you.
[2490.18 --> 2490.54]  Now,
[2490.62 --> 2498.10]  part of why it's comically easy for me is that I'm obsessively going in after every random encounter and like fine tuning,
[2498.30 --> 2502.60]  which espers are on my guys so that I make sure that I get the best like level up stats.
[2502.90 --> 2503.00]  Oh,
[2503.04 --> 2503.96]  I'm definitely not doing that.
[2504.08 --> 2504.26]  Yeah.
[2504.38 --> 2505.06]  Don't do that.
[2505.10 --> 2505.50]  Don't do that.
[2505.50 --> 2507.82]  Cause it makes the game like comically easy.
[2507.86 --> 2510.08]  It also doesn't feel necessary to be honest.
[2510.22 --> 2510.54]  Anyway,
[2510.64 --> 2511.84]  back to never lost.
[2512.60 --> 2512.90]  Really?
[2513.18 --> 2513.44]  Yeah.
[2513.62 --> 2513.74]  Oh,
[2513.74 --> 2514.12]  I've still,
[2514.24 --> 2515.32]  I've still managed to lose some,
[2515.42 --> 2517.14]  but it might just be cause I'm like clowning around,
[2517.46 --> 2517.56]  but,
[2517.74 --> 2518.44]  um,
[2518.62 --> 2518.92]  you'll,
[2519.08 --> 2519.86]  you'll lose some stuff.
[2519.86 --> 2522.38]  I'm sure you'll definitely very close.
[2522.44 --> 2524.66]  A few times there was one of the,
[2524.74 --> 2524.86]  like,
[2524.90 --> 2526.92]  I think it was more of a mini boss and a natural boss,
[2527.00 --> 2529.74]  but I don't know if my scaling was weird for that fight or something,
[2529.80 --> 2530.70]  but I found it very hard.
[2530.86 --> 2532.82]  I went down to one person at one point,
[2533.00 --> 2534.62]  but was able to bring people back up.
[2534.62 --> 2535.40]  Are you,
[2535.40 --> 2535.42]  are you,
[2535.42 --> 2535.84]  um,
[2535.84 --> 2536.60]  are you,
[2536.60 --> 2541.80]  are you leveling up all of your characters or do you just have like one main party of four that you just are going with?
[2542.14 --> 2542.42]  Uh,
[2543.42 --> 2546.50]  there's a couple people that I really try to always have there,
[2546.56 --> 2547.28]  but other than that,
[2547.32 --> 2548.84]  I'm mostly trying to cycle a little bit.
[2548.84 --> 2549.44]  Oh,
[2549.52 --> 2551.90]  another big one is a seven's blitzes.
[2552.32 --> 2554.96]  Like you had to enter them without any indicator.
[2554.96 --> 2555.90]  Oh,
[2555.90 --> 2562.38]  so you just like wouldn't find out until he went to execute the action and be like,
[2562.52 --> 2562.68]  yeah,
[2562.68 --> 2563.42]  you input it wrong.
[2563.80 --> 2563.94]  Yeah.
[2564.02 --> 2564.90]  And so he does this thing.
[2564.96 --> 2567.58]  He'd go forward and his eyes would flash like he's about to do it.
[2567.58 --> 2569.64]  And it would just say incorrect blitz input and he'd go back.
[2569.88 --> 2570.02]  Oh,
[2570.38 --> 2571.72]  also a cayenne.
[2572.14 --> 2572.50]  Um,
[2572.54 --> 2575.46]  you know how you just like pick whatever sword technique you want to use.
[2575.66 --> 2576.10]  Yeah.
[2576.12 --> 2576.72]  He had a timer.
[2577.48 --> 2578.66]  So you had to wait.
[2579.64 --> 2583.12]  And if you played like me with active turn battle,
[2583.12 --> 2586.64]  so like everything's happening in real time while you're sitting in the menus.
[2587.22 --> 2590.40]  If you're waiting for like quadra slam for his fourth,
[2590.58 --> 2594.16]  you're like waiting and getting like creamed.
[2594.40 --> 2594.54]  Yeah.
[2594.96 --> 2595.40]  Um,
[2595.50 --> 2596.10]  so there were,
[2596.20 --> 2597.56]  there were some,
[2597.58 --> 2598.44]  some big,
[2598.44 --> 2600.76]  big difficulty differences.
[2600.98 --> 2601.08]  Yeah.
[2601.08 --> 2602.82]  Like Sabin's in my party all the time.
[2603.14 --> 2603.36]  Yeah.
[2603.38 --> 2604.18]  I think he's my,
[2604.24 --> 2606.22]  my like main,
[2606.34 --> 2606.84]  I guess,
[2606.94 --> 2608.72]  but most other people swap out a little bit.
[2608.84 --> 2609.22]  He was,
[2609.34 --> 2612.30]  he was less reliable in the original version,
[2612.30 --> 2613.88]  unless you were like really good at the inputs.
[2613.88 --> 2616.42]  I think I've only ever missed one because it displays it.
[2616.42 --> 2616.60]  Yeah.
[2616.62 --> 2617.10]  It shows you.
[2617.34 --> 2618.20]  You can't screw it up.
[2618.32 --> 2618.58]  I was like,
[2618.64 --> 2619.54]  Oh yeah.
[2619.58 --> 2622.22]  I only missed one because I just like fat fingered a button or something.
[2622.32 --> 2622.62]  I was like,
[2622.66 --> 2623.14]  Oh crap.
[2623.50 --> 2623.62]  Yeah.
[2623.62 --> 2623.92]  It was.
[2624.28 --> 2624.44]  Yeah.
[2624.52 --> 2624.68]  Yeah.
[2624.68 --> 2625.24]  That's about it.
[2625.34 --> 2626.68]  And sometimes you can get unlucky.
[2626.68 --> 2629.92]  Like when the party split up and you recruit shadow.
[2630.48 --> 2630.68]  Yeah.
[2630.78 --> 2631.52]  You know about that.
[2631.60 --> 2631.72]  Yeah.
[2632.04 --> 2632.60]  There's a,
[2632.66 --> 2633.28]  there's a random,
[2633.66 --> 2634.24]  there's an RNG.
[2634.50 --> 2637.82]  He leaves and he can leave after the first item leave after the first fight once.
[2637.94 --> 2638.18]  Yeah.
[2638.28 --> 2639.66]  He's stuck with me for quite a while.
[2639.76 --> 2640.38]  And I was like,
[2640.38 --> 2641.30]  okay.
[2642.14 --> 2642.82]  That's cool.
[2644.82 --> 2645.54]  Pretty neat.
[2645.54 --> 2646.28]  Good game.
[2647.90 --> 2648.74]  Well designed.
[2648.90 --> 2649.70]  It'd be nice to be.
[2649.96 --> 2650.14]  Yeah.
[2650.52 --> 2654.22]  If that started after like at least a few fights or something.
[2654.38 --> 2654.50]  Yep.
[2655.36 --> 2655.76]  Also,
[2655.76 --> 2657.08]  because I've played the game before,
[2657.14 --> 2659.88]  I know when to like unequip guys cause they're going to like leave.
[2660.04 --> 2662.50]  So that I can like gotten wrecked by that a couple of times.
[2662.50 --> 2662.80]  Yeah.
[2662.84 --> 2667.04]  Or like a lot of really good things go into one person and they piece for like a while.
[2667.52 --> 2667.92]  Okay.
[2668.24 --> 2668.58]  Yeah.
[2668.74 --> 2670.00]  Well now when they come back,
[2670.06 --> 2671.24]  those things aren't very good anymore.
[2671.46 --> 2671.62]  Yeah.
[2671.64 --> 2673.78]  And the sell rates is pretty rough.
[2673.88 --> 2674.98]  I don't actually know what it is,
[2675.02 --> 2675.68]  but it's pretty rough.
[2675.90 --> 2676.64]  So 5090.
[2677.32 --> 2677.72]  Right.
[2677.92 --> 2678.88]  I'm going to buy one.
[2679.06 --> 2680.72]  To play Final Fantasy six on your ally.
[2680.98 --> 2681.64]  To play whatever,
[2682.08 --> 2682.66]  to play,
[2682.78 --> 2683.92]  to play whatever I want.
[2684.26 --> 2687.34]  To play Anno released five years ago on your PC.
[2687.54 --> 2687.78]  Dude,
[2687.78 --> 2689.56]  I just got a,
[2689.56 --> 2691.26]  a 4k 240 Hertz,
[2691.36 --> 2692.08]  27 inch.
[2694.60 --> 2696.40]  It supports DP one point,
[2696.46 --> 2696.60]  uh,
[2696.64 --> 2697.18]  2.1.
[2697.48 --> 2697.84]  Wait,
[2697.92 --> 2699.96]  I didn't get anything.
[2702.88 --> 2704.44]  I'm not talking about anything,
[2704.60 --> 2707.14]  but if you did get something in the future,
[2707.36 --> 2708.88]  there'd be a video about it for sure.
[2709.04 --> 2711.24]  And you'd want to make sure that you had something powerful to run it,
[2711.28 --> 2711.66]  I guess.
[2711.78 --> 2712.08]  Yes.
[2712.54 --> 2713.48]  Just in case.
[2713.58 --> 2716.14]  Cause those potential resolution and frame rates,
[2716.14 --> 2717.28]  that would be really tough.
[2717.54 --> 2717.86]  Just,
[2717.98 --> 2718.20]  yeah.
[2718.54 --> 2718.94]  Yeah.
[2719.14 --> 2720.30]  You didn't say who it's from.
[2720.48 --> 2720.72]  Yeah,
[2720.72 --> 2721.60]  that's true actually.
[2721.72 --> 2721.94]  Yeah.
[2722.28 --> 2722.56]  Yeah.
[2722.56 --> 2724.42]  That helps quite a bit.
[2724.92 --> 2725.04]  Uh,
[2726.18 --> 2726.54]  cool.
[2726.98 --> 2727.42]  Anyway,
[2727.78 --> 2728.20]  um,
[2728.28 --> 2730.08]  apparently it's got a single 12 volt,
[2730.28 --> 2731.34]  two by six power connector,
[2731.34 --> 2733.06]  which replaces 12 volt high power.
[2733.78 --> 2734.26]  Um,
[2734.36 --> 2735.40]  shorter sensor pins,
[2735.62 --> 2736.74]  longer conductor terminals.
[2736.74 --> 2737.30]  Okay.
[2737.96 --> 2739.32]  Or hear me out in video.
[2740.54 --> 2741.60]  PCI E 8 pin.
[2741.84 --> 2743.48]  Just put a bunch of them on like we used to.
[2743.58 --> 2743.68]  Uh,
[2743.74 --> 2744.12]  do you know what?
[2744.16 --> 2744.46]  Forget it.
[2744.46 --> 2744.68]  Actually,
[2744.72 --> 2745.20]  it's a bad idea.
[2745.52 --> 2745.94]  All right.
[2745.94 --> 2747.16]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[2747.26 --> 2747.46]  Uh,
[2747.46 --> 2748.46]  explain merch messages.
[2748.46 --> 2750.14]  Uh,
[2750.22 --> 2750.58]  yes.
[2750.98 --> 2752.88]  A few of you have found them already.
[2752.88 --> 2753.74]  I assume Dan,
[2753.80 --> 2755.26]  how's the merch messages going over there?
[2755.56 --> 2756.70]  They're pretty good.
[2756.74 --> 2758.14]  I'm keeping up just fine.
[2758.36 --> 2758.84]  Really?
[2759.50 --> 2759.94]  Okay.
[2759.94 --> 2760.34]  Well,
[2760.54 --> 2768.80]  we haven't really talked for anyone who doesn't know about it yet about the deal we have running on the all new commuter backpack.
[2769.22 --> 2769.88]  It's here.
[2769.98 --> 2770.40]  Let's go.
[2771.92 --> 2773.04]  You've looked at it already,
[2773.10 --> 2773.30]  right?
[2773.40 --> 2773.76]  I have one.
[2774.06 --> 2774.30]  Oh,
[2774.32 --> 2774.66]  you have one.
[2774.70 --> 2775.32]  How do you like it?
[2775.42 --> 2776.46]  It's very nice.
[2776.46 --> 2778.40]  I immediately,
[2778.56 --> 2782.82]  I traditionally walked around with the power connector and laptop just like loose around work.
[2782.90 --> 2785.10]  And now it's my like my work backpack,
[2785.34 --> 2785.94]  which is nice.
[2786.16 --> 2786.92]  Let's go.
[2787.28 --> 2788.06]  This is it,
[2788.18 --> 2788.48]  folks.
[2788.64 --> 2789.80]  The commuter bag.
[2789.86 --> 2792.94]  It is selling like billio.
[2793.38 --> 2793.70]  Um,
[2793.70 --> 2796.14]  people are absolutely loving this thing.
[2796.18 --> 2797.58]  I've got a fully loaded one here.
[2797.64 --> 2798.76]  We're going to switch to the Linus.
[2799.00 --> 2799.24]  Oh,
[2800.18 --> 2800.38]  okay.
[2800.66 --> 2804.34]  We're maybe going to have to adjust this at some point because I,
[2804.46 --> 2805.02]  oh,
[2805.12 --> 2806.04]  just hit my mic.
[2806.04 --> 2806.54]  Yeah.
[2806.58 --> 2809.10]  Holding it on this side with the mic is very challenging.
[2809.18 --> 2809.40]  Anyway,
[2809.68 --> 2811.78]  it's got two water bottle holders.
[2811.84 --> 2813.12]  They are the same size.
[2813.60 --> 2814.14]  Both of them.
[2814.54 --> 2814.80]  Um,
[2814.86 --> 2815.02]  no,
[2815.06 --> 2815.34]  it's okay.
[2815.66 --> 2816.98]  We have two water bottle holders,
[2817.08 --> 2819.02]  so you can use one for your umbrella,
[2819.26 --> 2820.74]  one for your water bottle,
[2821.00 --> 2822.20]  whatever you like.
[2822.40 --> 2824.32]  We've got our pouch of holding.
[2824.46 --> 2825.06]  Oh my goodness.
[2825.06 --> 2825.58]  I'm dying.
[2825.94 --> 2826.26]  Um,
[2826.32 --> 2827.94]  yeah,
[2828.12 --> 2829.04]  I'd be fine,
[2829.14 --> 2830.72]  but I got some tennis elbow.
[2830.88 --> 2832.44]  So my arm is in a lot of pain.
[2832.50 --> 2832.68]  Okay.
[2832.68 --> 2832.90]  Yeah.
[2833.04 --> 2833.24]  Yeah.
[2833.40 --> 2835.12]  If you just wanted to finish on doing the zipper,
[2835.44 --> 2836.12]  that'd be great.
[2836.36 --> 2836.96]  There we go.
[2837.18 --> 2838.90]  So it comes all the way down.
[2839.04 --> 2840.28]  Put your mouse in there.
[2840.36 --> 2841.60]  Put your tech sack in there.
[2841.72 --> 2842.96]  Put your notepad in there.
[2843.06 --> 2844.08]  Your SSD in there.
[2844.16 --> 2844.56]  Your pen.
[2844.78 --> 2845.38]  Your screwdriver,
[2845.38 --> 2846.08]  of course,
[2846.14 --> 2849.14]  with our classic zippered screwdriver pocket,
[2849.24 --> 2851.26]  in case you drop a bit or something like that in the bottom.
[2851.34 --> 2853.22]  We want to make sure you guys are able to get that out.
[2853.60 --> 2856.44]  We've got a sunglass holder in the top.
[2856.78 --> 2858.36]  Sunglass pouch right in there.
[2858.42 --> 2860.26]  Get your sunglasses in there.
[2860.48 --> 2861.44]  And then of course,
[2861.98 --> 2862.98]  it's tech forward.
[2863.40 --> 2865.02]  Zips all the way down,
[2865.10 --> 2866.64]  so you can reach all your good stuff.
[2867.08 --> 2869.34]  With two spots for battery banks,
[2869.34 --> 2872.26]  or even gigantic power bricks and cables,
[2872.44 --> 2873.46]  and then a tablet slot,
[2873.54 --> 2875.58]  as well as a laptop slot,
[2875.68 --> 2877.00]  and another zippered pouch there.
[2877.62 --> 2877.98]  Oh,
[2878.12 --> 2879.26]  and the best part,
[2879.78 --> 2882.80]  and the part that has got people losing their minds is,
[2882.98 --> 2885.20]  I saw a lot of pricing speculation with people saying like,
[2885.28 --> 2885.42]  yeah,
[2885.48 --> 2886.38]  $150,
[2886.48 --> 2886.80]  $150,
[2887.00 --> 2887.56]  that'd be like,
[2887.94 --> 2888.76]  that'd be like sick.
[2888.94 --> 2889.84]  $150 would be great,
[2889.94 --> 2891.40]  but I'm afraid to hope for it,
[2891.40 --> 2894.70]  because this is all the same quality materials as the original bag,
[2894.78 --> 2895.62]  YKK zippers,
[2896.22 --> 2897.22]  reprieve fabric,
[2897.46 --> 2898.68]  made of recycled water bottles,
[2898.78 --> 2899.68]  all that good stuff.
[2902.32 --> 2902.76]  But,
[2902.92 --> 2903.42]  we did it.
[2903.82 --> 2904.30]  $150,
[2904.72 --> 2905.20]  and,
[2905.52 --> 2906.78]  for a limited time only,
[2906.84 --> 2908.72]  and I really do mean limited time only,
[2909.14 --> 2910.80]  it is $30 off.
[2910.80 --> 2912.08]  It is $120,
[2912.32 --> 2913.90]  if you buy it through YouTube shopping.
[2915.02 --> 2915.50]  Oh.
[2916.64 --> 2919.60]  I just want to give you guys a little update here.
[2920.50 --> 2920.98]  Um,
[2921.40 --> 2923.98]  hold on,
[2924.02 --> 2924.96]  I'm just going to refresh the thing.
[2925.26 --> 2925.56]  So,
[2925.88 --> 2928.32]  I already told people on the WAN show before,
[2928.72 --> 2929.16]  someone says,
[2929.26 --> 2930.58]  I missed the YouTube deal.
[2930.78 --> 2931.04]  Sad.
[2931.22 --> 2931.36]  No,
[2931.42 --> 2931.76]  you didn't.
[2931.82 --> 2933.42]  The YouTube deal is active.
[2933.50 --> 2934.68]  It's active now.
[2935.48 --> 2935.90]  Um,
[2936.20 --> 2937.64]  I told you guys before,
[2937.82 --> 2940.40]  it's limited to 1,700 units.
[2941.26 --> 2942.10]  So far,
[2942.70 --> 2944.60]  and Luke can verify this,
[2944.66 --> 2945.62]  because apparently I'm a,
[2945.68 --> 2947.38]  I'm a big liar in a scumbag,
[2947.66 --> 2950.40]  if you believe all of the recent scandals or whatever.
[2950.40 --> 2951.38]  Um,
[2952.24 --> 2956.84]  we're at 12,635 units.
[2957.38 --> 2957.86]  So,
[2957.94 --> 2959.26]  we still have,
[2959.38 --> 2960.26]  what does that work out to?
[2960.66 --> 2964.18]  4,400 units at the discounted price.
[2965.64 --> 2966.98]  It is possible,
[2967.52 --> 2968.82]  it is possible,
[2968.82 --> 2971.28]  that they will not make it through the weekend.
[2971.28 --> 2972.20]  So,
[2972.26 --> 2973.90]  if you guys want to pick one up,
[2974.16 --> 2976.90]  the discount is through YouTube shopping.
[2979.00 --> 2979.36]  What?
[2979.50 --> 2980.34]  Those numbers make no sense.
[2980.42 --> 2980.48]  Oh,
[2980.52 --> 2981.48]  17,000.
[2981.84 --> 2983.08]  We have 17,000.
[2983.08 --> 2983.30]  Oh,
[2983.30 --> 2983.86]  do you say 1,700?
[2984.12 --> 2984.30]  My bad.
[2984.30 --> 2984.46]  Okay.
[2984.80 --> 2984.98]  Uh,
[2984.98 --> 2985.20]  well,
[2985.24 --> 2985.44]  I mean,
[2985.46 --> 2985.94]  I'm a big liar,
[2986.04 --> 2987.34]  so that's probably it.
[2987.74 --> 2988.10]  Um,
[2988.80 --> 2989.88]  so we have,
[2989.96 --> 2992.12]  we have 4,400 more discounts.
[2992.58 --> 2993.86]  You buy it through YouTube shopping,
[2994.08 --> 2994.30]  which,
[2994.56 --> 2994.76]  Dan,
[2994.84 --> 2996.60]  is it set up on WAN Show today?
[2996.70 --> 2997.78]  It should be pinned.
[2998.24 --> 2998.60]  Um,
[2998.76 --> 3003.04]  I've seen some stuff that you might have to disable ad blocker for it to show up if you are using one.
[3003.18 --> 3003.72]  That makes sense.
[3003.76 --> 3004.64]  One thing that I'm finding,
[3004.94 --> 3005.14]  yeah,
[3005.26 --> 3005.66]  as well,
[3005.76 --> 3006.30]  so you have to,
[3006.36 --> 3008.48]  you have to click on the little product.
[3008.62 --> 3008.78]  Okay,
[3008.86 --> 3009.12]  so,
[3009.52 --> 3010.16]  I'll go to my laptop.
[3010.28 --> 3011.32]  You have to click on this thing.
[3012.00 --> 3012.40]  Uh,
[3012.40 --> 3014.68]  and then when it goes to the store,
[3014.86 --> 3017.26]  it's not going to show the discount immediately.
[3018.26 --> 3018.58]  So,
[3018.58 --> 3020.58]  you have to add it to your cart.
[3020.70 --> 3021.54]  It shows the full price.
[3021.64 --> 3022.18]  You have to add it to,
[3022.24 --> 3023.70]  because it's YouTube's discount,
[3023.80 --> 3024.00]  whatever.
[3024.18 --> 3024.28]  Yeah.
[3024.36 --> 3024.44]  So,
[3024.44 --> 3025.24]  you have to add it to your cart,
[3025.30 --> 3026.32]  and then in your cart,
[3026.58 --> 3027.34]  you'll see it.
[3027.78 --> 3028.14]  Boom.
[3028.70 --> 3030.66]  Someone says WTF not on float plane.
[3030.92 --> 3032.16]  That's because the money,
[3032.52 --> 3033.08]  the $30,
[3033.42 --> 3033.98]  It's going from YouTube.
[3034.08 --> 3035.56]  is not from us.
[3035.96 --> 3036.22]  Yeah.
[3036.58 --> 3036.86]  So,
[3037.06 --> 3038.78]  when your payment goes through,
[3039.34 --> 3041.12]  YouTube kicks in $30.
[3041.50 --> 3042.94]  We are getting $150.
[3043.62 --> 3045.60]  But to promote YouTube shopping,
[3046.60 --> 3047.62]  Google is,
[3047.62 --> 3050.98]  is sort of co-launching this product with us.
[3051.08 --> 3052.12]  An extremely,
[3052.58 --> 3054.44]  extremely generous offer.
[3055.28 --> 3055.44]  Um,
[3055.52 --> 3057.42]  we would be charging $149.99.
[3057.78 --> 3059.98]  And we're going to keep selling this backpack for years,
[3060.02 --> 3061.12]  at $149.99.
[3061.76 --> 3062.08]  Um,
[3062.08 --> 3062.40]  and,
[3062.70 --> 3066.80]  based on the reactions that people had to the original price when we announced it,
[3067.12 --> 3067.48]  um,
[3067.56 --> 3067.72]  that,
[3067.80 --> 3068.62]  that's going to do great,
[3068.66 --> 3070.26]  and it's going to go gangbusters for us,
[3070.26 --> 3072.96]  for everyone who doesn't see this message right now.
[3073.20 --> 3073.66]  But,
[3074.16 --> 3074.62]  Google,
[3074.92 --> 3076.80]  is pitching in $30 US dollars.
[3077.06 --> 3077.40]  So,
[3077.46 --> 3078.22]  you could see that,
[3078.54 --> 3079.36]  oh,
[3079.36 --> 3083.44]  I will not talk in any more detail about anything.
[3084.50 --> 3084.90]  Uh,
[3085.70 --> 3087.20]  cool.
[3087.64 --> 3088.06]  Anyway,
[3088.50 --> 3089.92]  buy it through YouTube shopping,
[3090.04 --> 3090.92]  $119.99.
[3091.58 --> 3091.90]  Oh no,
[3091.96 --> 3092.60]  what did I miss?
[3092.88 --> 3093.24]  I don't know,
[3093.28 --> 3094.70]  I got like four messages from Nick.
[3094.70 --> 3095.76]  He just says stop talking.
[3095.92 --> 3096.12]  So,
[3096.18 --> 3096.44]  I'm good.
[3096.90 --> 3097.18]  It's,
[3097.18 --> 3098.96]  it's technically 120.00.
[3098.96 --> 3102.40]  Got him.
[3102.78 --> 3103.76]  Linus is liar again.
[3104.82 --> 3105.02]  Yeah.
[3105.34 --> 3105.74]  Confirmed.
[3105.84 --> 3106.28]  Confirmed.
[3106.38 --> 3106.86]  Unethical.
[3108.34 --> 3110.66]  Are you hiding the rest of the zeros from us?
[3111.30 --> 3112.10]  Free the floats.
[3112.44 --> 3112.80]  Anyhow,
[3112.86 --> 3113.18]  anyway,
[3113.46 --> 3115.52]  the point is we love YouTube shopping.
[3118.32 --> 3120.28]  And we love our Google overlords.
[3120.56 --> 3122.02]  I don't think they love us right now.
[3122.34 --> 3122.88]  I don't know,
[3122.96 --> 3123.74]  maybe they won't notice.
[3125.56 --> 3125.96]  Okay,
[3125.96 --> 3126.24]  well,
[3126.32 --> 3127.20]  that's a merge message.
[3127.30 --> 3128.94]  Would you like me to read you one before you do this?
[3128.96 --> 3129.48]  Oh yeah,
[3129.56 --> 3130.66]  we should explain merge messages.
[3130.88 --> 3131.08]  So,
[3131.20 --> 3132.74]  while you're checking out on the store,
[3132.90 --> 3134.24]  you can leave a merge message.
[3134.24 --> 3135.60]  If you just put something in your cart,
[3135.70 --> 3136.52]  you'll get a little box.
[3136.68 --> 3136.82]  Hey,
[3136.90 --> 3137.42]  there you go.
[3137.74 --> 3139.60]  And you can send a merge message.
[3139.74 --> 3140.38]  Producer Dan,
[3140.54 --> 3143.26]  who looks like this and is in the dark today.
[3144.10 --> 3144.50]  Okay.
[3144.74 --> 3147.60]  We couldn't afford power over Christmas.
[3147.90 --> 3148.66]  Christmas was,
[3148.82 --> 3150.36]  we had too many Christmas lights running.
[3150.44 --> 3151.98]  We couldn't afford any lights for Dan.
[3152.96 --> 3153.86]  Lake dried up.
[3153.92 --> 3154.14]  Anyway,
[3154.14 --> 3155.16]  it'll go to producer Dan,
[3155.24 --> 3158.82]  who will pop your message up here or give you a response.
[3158.96 --> 3162.92]  Or curate it for me and Luke to respond to on the show.
[3163.02 --> 3163.20]  Dan,
[3163.26 --> 3165.48]  do you want to show us how it works?
[3165.74 --> 3166.14]  Sure.
[3166.62 --> 3167.06]  Hi,
[3167.24 --> 3168.18]  LDL.
[3168.28 --> 3170.62]  Looking at where Luke is today.
[3170.90 --> 3172.86]  What do you guys think about lying on your resume?
[3172.86 --> 3177.16]  I'm looking for a new job and want to know what you guys think.
[3177.34 --> 3178.22]  Keep up the good work.
[3180.04 --> 3180.44]  Well,
[3180.56 --> 3182.74]  being an unethical liar,
[3183.18 --> 3186.02]  I would say lie as hard as you can,
[3186.40 --> 3188.04]  as much as you can.
[3189.58 --> 3191.14]  I wouldn't advise it.
[3191.48 --> 3193.16]  By the time Luke,
[3193.16 --> 3194.44]  first of all,
[3194.66 --> 3197.42]  Luke faked it till he made it.
[3197.76 --> 3198.00]  Yeah.
[3198.16 --> 3199.18]  That part's pretty important.
[3199.18 --> 3204.38]  He did manage to successfully perform the job functions as expected,
[3204.52 --> 3209.14]  even though he did not have the experience that he claimed to have when he came into it.
[3209.26 --> 3210.38]  He figured it out.
[3210.62 --> 3212.42]  So you're going to have to be ready to do that.
[3212.42 --> 3216.44]  And by the time he got busted or rather admitted it to me,
[3216.50 --> 3217.58]  it was in a,
[3217.58 --> 3220.40]  an as friends conversation as friends.
[3220.72 --> 3221.98]  And I was like,
[3222.06 --> 3222.80]  Oh,
[3222.94 --> 3224.08]  you also,
[3224.20 --> 3226.18]  this is far from the worst you've done at this point.
[3226.30 --> 3226.84]  So I believe.
[3232.84 --> 3233.92]  That sounds about right.
[3234.12 --> 3234.74]  It's not,
[3235.08 --> 3238.36]  it's not a good way to kick off a relationship.
[3239.36 --> 3239.84]  Yes.
[3239.84 --> 3242.18]  And I wouldn't advise you to try it.
[3242.42 --> 3242.64]  Yeah.
[3243.24 --> 3243.68]  Yeah.
[3244.20 --> 3245.10]  Oh man.
[3245.50 --> 3245.94]  Yeah.
[3246.30 --> 3247.34]  I've also like,
[3247.80 --> 3250.72]  I've had a not insignificant amount.
[3250.82 --> 3252.62]  I kind of wish I never said it on camera,
[3252.62 --> 3255.06]  not because I don't mind owning it,
[3255.06 --> 3257.66]  but because people have like taken it as like a,
[3257.66 --> 3259.52]  I'll do this to him.
[3259.94 --> 3261.04]  And it'll be funny.
[3261.28 --> 3262.54]  It serves you right.
[3262.74 --> 3264.60]  And I've caught a bunch of people doing it.
[3264.62 --> 3265.16]  And then I'm like,
[3265.20 --> 3265.46]  well,
[3265.56 --> 3266.36]  I can't like,
[3266.44 --> 3267.38]  this isn't,
[3267.44 --> 3268.28]  that doesn't work.
[3268.40 --> 3268.54]  Yeah.
[3268.56 --> 3269.02]  If you get,
[3269.02 --> 3271.54]  so it's one of those things where it's like big bet,
[3271.54 --> 3272.86]  big reward,
[3273.24 --> 3274.18]  big downside.
[3274.32 --> 3274.56]  Yeah.
[3274.76 --> 3275.00]  Right.
[3275.08 --> 3275.54]  Bet big.
[3275.62 --> 3277.06]  You either win big or lose big,
[3277.06 --> 3279.40]  because if we don't catch you,
[3279.70 --> 3280.76]  maybe you get the job.
[3281.00 --> 3282.14]  If we catch you,
[3282.32 --> 3285.52]  you will almost certainly be removed from any consideration.
[3285.72 --> 3285.82]  Yeah.
[3285.82 --> 3286.52]  And a lot of the,
[3286.60 --> 3287.76]  a lot of the positions have like,
[3287.88 --> 3290.84]  and technically the one that I did had a form of testing as well,
[3290.84 --> 3296.28]  but a lot of the positions here have some form of testing or like a trial period or something like that.
[3296.28 --> 3296.54]  Yeah.
[3296.56 --> 3299.50]  My interview process for him was a three hour vibe check.
[3299.76 --> 3299.94]  So.
[3300.34 --> 3300.58]  And,
[3300.66 --> 3301.70]  and we filmed something.
[3302.98 --> 3303.38]  Um,
[3304.00 --> 3304.54]  in fairness,
[3304.68 --> 3306.72]  filming stuff back then was as simple as like,
[3306.80 --> 3307.16]  Oh yeah.
[3307.38 --> 3309.70]  Can you make sure that the correct object?
[3309.84 --> 3310.74]  It doesn't have zoom.
[3311.02 --> 3311.96]  So just do this.
[3312.18 --> 3312.46]  Dude,
[3312.46 --> 3313.28]  with that said though,
[3313.34 --> 3315.38]  you'd be surprised at how many people f*** that up.
[3315.46 --> 3316.78]  They just couldn't.
[3316.86 --> 3317.30]  They just like,
[3317.32 --> 3317.76]  couldn't.
[3317.90 --> 3318.46]  I'd be like,
[3319.02 --> 3320.22]  cause like for you,
[3320.30 --> 3320.82]  it's obvious,
[3320.82 --> 3321.26]  right?
[3321.60 --> 3322.22]  If I'm like,
[3322.96 --> 3323.34]  uh,
[3323.40 --> 3323.64]  you know,
[3323.92 --> 3325.94]  Google's had an amazing year this year.
[3326.02 --> 3328.20]  They've come out with this and they've come out with that.
[3328.52 --> 3331.00]  And what I really want to show you is this.
[3331.12 --> 3332.02]  And I look at,
[3332.60 --> 3332.74]  okay.
[3332.80 --> 3333.44]  So to him,
[3333.46 --> 3334.14]  that's obvious.
[3334.14 --> 3340.38]  You wouldn't believe the number of people who just stayed on me while I was literally not even looking in the lens.
[3340.56 --> 3343.22]  And I'm like talking about this thing in my hands and I'm like,
[3343.74 --> 3346.08]  this,
[3346.24 --> 3346.48]  this,
[3346.66 --> 3347.56]  for the love of God,
[3347.66 --> 3347.90]  this,
[3348.00 --> 3349.72]  there was no second take back then.
[3350.06 --> 3350.54]  Yeah.
[3350.54 --> 3350.66]  Yeah.
[3351.08 --> 3354.70]  Especially cause a lot of it legitimately was taking the thing out of the box.
[3355.28 --> 3357.56]  And in many cases that was breaking seals.
[3357.56 --> 3358.30]  So like there,
[3358.44 --> 3360.04]  there was no second take.
[3360.16 --> 3360.40]  Yeah.
[3361.40 --> 3362.48]  ZMBT says Luke,
[3362.74 --> 3365.42]  Luke's problem was he just focused the camera on the road.
[3366.86 --> 3367.94]  That's a good reference.
[3368.14 --> 3368.30]  Yeah.
[3368.42 --> 3368.60]  That's a,
[3368.60 --> 3370.00]  that's a quality reference.
[3372.64 --> 3373.40]  Oh man.
[3374.72 --> 3375.12]  Anyways.
[3375.20 --> 3375.32]  Yeah.
[3375.32 --> 3375.70]  I don't,
[3376.24 --> 3376.38]  yeah.
[3376.42 --> 3377.16]  Don't do that.
[3377.68 --> 3378.12]  Yeah.
[3378.12 --> 3380.74]  Dear Duke.
[3380.86 --> 3381.10]  Oh,
[3381.12 --> 3381.52]  hold on.
[3381.64 --> 3382.00]  Hold on.
[3382.20 --> 3386.44]  By East one says there is no second take because there's only one tape.
[3386.86 --> 3388.42]  There were times we cheated.
[3389.46 --> 3390.06]  Oh yeah.
[3390.18 --> 3391.60]  If something went catastrophically wrong,
[3391.74 --> 3393.06]  we would turn the box around.
[3393.34 --> 3393.56]  Yeah.
[3393.72 --> 3395.32]  And break the seal on the other side.
[3395.38 --> 3395.78]  For sure.
[3396.00 --> 3396.22]  Yeah.
[3396.22 --> 3396.94]  It's just,
[3397.02 --> 3398.76]  you don't aim to do that.
[3398.92 --> 3399.08]  Yeah.
[3399.16 --> 3400.66]  That's supposed to be like a really,
[3400.86 --> 3405.38]  really like last solution type situation.
[3405.64 --> 3410.66]  Do you want to show Lieutenant Beefy where YouTube shop is really quick?
[3410.72 --> 3411.16]  One more time.
[3411.22 --> 3412.90]  There's a few people that are having trouble finding it.
[3412.96 --> 3414.58]  If you are having trouble finding it.
[3414.58 --> 3414.90]  So it's,
[3414.90 --> 3418.44]  it's on the six months ago I tease you with this LTT store commuter backpack video.
[3418.48 --> 3419.36]  That is not a great still frame.
[3422.42 --> 3426.12]  If you're having trouble seeing this little block right here,
[3426.22 --> 3432.56]  it's probably something to do with ad blocking or tracking blocking or something like that.
[3432.82 --> 3435.38]  Some type of add on you have or potentially your browser,
[3435.50 --> 3436.64]  but you're probably running Chrome.
[3436.84 --> 3437.80]  So it's probably fine.
[3438.76 --> 3440.18]  Should be on this one show as well.
[3440.60 --> 3440.80]  Oh,
[3440.88 --> 3441.10]  okay.
[3441.26 --> 3441.88]  I didn't know that.
[3441.88 --> 3444.30]  That should be pinned in this land show.
[3444.58 --> 3445.82]  I sure hope so.
[3447.58 --> 3448.42]  Let's see.
[3449.32 --> 3450.28]  Let's see.
[3452.48 --> 3453.28]  There it is.
[3453.48 --> 3453.88]  Cool.
[3454.10 --> 3454.30]  Okay.
[3454.48 --> 3455.74]  So that's how you do it.
[3455.96 --> 3456.66]  And then that should bring you.
[3456.72 --> 3456.82]  Yeah,
[3456.82 --> 3457.14]  right here.
[3457.24 --> 3457.86]  And then again,
[3457.86 --> 3458.74]  when you get,
[3458.84 --> 3460.22]  when you get to this page,
[3460.22 --> 3462.28]  it's not going to actually show it lower.
[3462.44 --> 3464.88]  You have to add it to your cart and then in the cart,
[3464.98 --> 3467.06]  it will be discounted.
[3467.62 --> 3468.32]  Cool beans.
[3468.76 --> 3469.36]  There you go.
[3470.82 --> 3471.22]  Okay.
[3471.38 --> 3471.68]  One more.
[3472.08 --> 3472.46]  Uh,
[3472.52 --> 3472.82]  yeah,
[3472.94 --> 3473.12]  yeah,
[3473.12 --> 3473.36]  sure.
[3473.42 --> 3473.64]  Hit me,
[3473.70 --> 3474.54]  hit me with the merch message.
[3474.58 --> 3478.14]  Dear Duke and Dan and vertically challenged superstar.
[3478.52 --> 3478.66]  What?
[3479.20 --> 3479.64]  Sorry.
[3479.78 --> 3480.08]  One sec.
[3480.08 --> 3480.40]  Go for it.
[3480.42 --> 3485.22]  Some people are finding that it's a geo fence to a certain degree.
[3485.88 --> 3488.32]  So they have to VPN around to,
[3488.46 --> 3489.34]  to get it.
[3489.70 --> 3491.26]  I wonder if that is a YouTube thing.
[3491.36 --> 3491.44]  Yeah.
[3491.44 --> 3492.10]  I don't know.
[3492.36 --> 3492.66]  Could be.
[3493.12 --> 3493.34]  Yeah.
[3493.40 --> 3494.12]  It could be limited.
[3494.38 --> 3495.84]  I don't know anything about that.
[3495.88 --> 3497.28]  It's a YouTube shopping promo.
[3497.28 --> 3497.90]  So,
[3497.90 --> 3498.92]  um,
[3499.30 --> 3504.14]  we do not have any control over what regions YouTube shopping is able to operate in.
[3504.62 --> 3504.94]  And,
[3504.98 --> 3505.38]  um,
[3505.64 --> 3505.86]  Hey,
[3506.82 --> 3508.24]  it's still a great bag at one 50.
[3508.46 --> 3508.76]  Yeah.
[3509.04 --> 3509.30]  Yeah.
[3509.34 --> 3509.66]  True.
[3510.06 --> 3511.10]  Our notes say here,
[3511.10 --> 3515.12]  you may need to disable your ad blocker or VPN if you don't see the tagged product.
[3515.12 --> 3515.58]  So yeah,
[3515.60 --> 3516.62]  I think it is geo fenced.
[3518.04 --> 3519.50]  Or enable your VPN.
[3519.70 --> 3519.82]  No,
[3519.92 --> 3520.84]  I didn't say that.
[3520.90 --> 3521.70]  I didn't say that.
[3522.42 --> 3523.02]  Private internet.
[3525.06 --> 3525.46]  No,
[3525.52 --> 3526.96]  do we have a private internet access link?
[3527.52 --> 3527.96]  Coincidentally,
[3528.10 --> 3528.24]  Dan,
[3529.04 --> 3529.34]  uh,
[3529.34 --> 3530.02]  if we have,
[3530.12 --> 3530.48]  um,
[3530.92 --> 3531.62]  PIA,
[3531.62 --> 3535.74]  it's a service that we've talked about a lot that I've used for many,
[3535.86 --> 3536.60]  many years now.
[3536.72 --> 3537.00]  Yeah.
[3537.18 --> 3537.54]  And,
[3537.66 --> 3537.86]  uh,
[3538.18 --> 3538.46]  you know,
[3538.46 --> 3542.92]  just sometimes you run into situations where you need to access a thing as though the thing
[3542.92 --> 3544.04]  is from some other thing.
[3544.14 --> 3545.78]  I have no idea if it'll work on this.
[3545.90 --> 3547.30]  I legitimately don't know.
[3547.48 --> 3549.74]  Check if you're getting skizammed on flight prices.
[3549.96 --> 3550.40]  Like I've,
[3550.40 --> 3551.92]  I've run into times when,
[3551.92 --> 3552.48]  um,
[3552.62 --> 3554.00]  even using a VPN was,
[3554.16 --> 3555.08]  was not good enough.
[3555.08 --> 3556.58]  Like when I tried to buy a valve index,
[3556.68 --> 3556.84]  man,
[3556.88 --> 3557.40]  they got that,
[3557.50 --> 3558.54]  they got that locked.
[3558.92 --> 3560.48]  They had that locked down.
[3560.48 --> 3569.36]  I had to get someone from America with an American credit card from an American bank to buy that thing for me and send it up to me.
[3572.28 --> 3573.60]  God bless America.
[3574.54 --> 3574.86]  Um,
[3574.90 --> 3577.74]  have you ever had the scenario where you get cheaper flights?
[3578.08 --> 3578.58]  Yeehaw!
[3582.78 --> 3584.48]  Southern Linus would actually be amazing.
[3586.60 --> 3588.28]  These gosh darn 4090s.
[3588.28 --> 3590.98]  I will take a stand.
[3591.68 --> 3592.08]  Um,
[3592.28 --> 3592.68]  anyways,
[3592.98 --> 3593.44]  uh,
[3593.50 --> 3594.34]  have you,
[3594.36 --> 3596.00]  have you had the flight prices thing work?
[3597.10 --> 3597.50]  Uh,
[3597.58 --> 3597.68]  I,
[3597.82 --> 3598.44]  I have.
[3598.68 --> 3600.48]  I've had people tell me that's a,
[3600.56 --> 3601.20]  that's debunked.
[3601.22 --> 3601.84]  It's debunked,
[3601.84 --> 3602.32]  but I'm like,
[3602.34 --> 3603.36]  I don't know what to tell you.
[3603.40 --> 3604.58]  We literally did a video about it.
[3604.58 --> 3605.96]  It was theoretically debunked or not.
[3606.02 --> 3606.18]  I,
[3606.22 --> 3606.40]  I,
[3606.52 --> 3606.70]  I,
[3606.82 --> 3607.60]  there was recently,
[3607.60 --> 3611.84]  I thought it was working and then we figured out that it was Canadian versus USD,
[3612.04 --> 3613.32]  but they didn't show any differentiation.
[3613.32 --> 3613.82]  Oh,
[3613.82 --> 3614.18]  interesting.
[3614.44 --> 3614.80]  Um,
[3615.20 --> 3615.44]  yeah.
[3617.64 --> 3618.08]  Anyways,
[3618.40 --> 3618.72]  um,
[3618.72 --> 3620.88]  Southern Linus and the Luke's of Az.
[3623.22 --> 3623.66]  Okay,
[3623.80 --> 3625.72]  credit to PK7 and float plane chat.
[3625.82 --> 3626.38]  That's pretty good.
[3626.52 --> 3627.14]  10 out of 10.
[3627.52 --> 3628.24]  Nicely done.
[3628.24 --> 3630.46]  All right.
[3631.00 --> 3631.40]  Um,
[3631.56 --> 3631.76]  Dan,
[3631.82 --> 3632.62]  why don't you hit us with one more?
[3632.62 --> 3633.14]  I'm trying.
[3633.56 --> 3633.74]  Oh,
[3633.76 --> 3633.86]  wait,
[3633.90 --> 3634.68]  have you not done it yet?
[3634.76 --> 3635.02]  No.
[3635.24 --> 3635.40]  Well,
[3635.46 --> 3636.72]  get on with it,
[3636.78 --> 3636.98]  man.
[3637.08 --> 3642.54]  What is the jankiest solution or fix ever suggested for something that everyone said no to and looking
[3642.54 --> 3642.90]  back,
[3643.00 --> 3644.60]  how bad it would have really been?
[3644.74 --> 3645.06]  Oh,
[3645.22 --> 3645.52]  man.
[3645.70 --> 3646.82]  Everyone said no to.
[3647.00 --> 3647.20]  And,
[3647.32 --> 3650.34]  and it was worse than expected.
[3651.18 --> 3652.20]  Jankiest fix.
[3654.34 --> 3656.74]  Most of the terrible janky fix solutions,
[3656.74 --> 3657.36]  uh,
[3657.36 --> 3658.32]  I've just done them.
[3658.68 --> 3658.88]  Yeah.
[3658.96 --> 3660.50]  And they mostly work.
[3660.64 --> 3660.82]  Yeah.
[3660.88 --> 3661.10]  Like,
[3661.12 --> 3662.08]  I don't know if we've been,
[3662.16 --> 3664.08]  I don't know if we've been burned that badly.
[3666.58 --> 3666.98]  Like,
[3667.16 --> 3667.34]  yeah,
[3667.34 --> 3667.86]  to be honest.
[3668.10 --> 3668.28]  Oh,
[3668.58 --> 3669.22]  um,
[3669.64 --> 3670.16]  um,
[3670.96 --> 3671.36]  the,
[3671.66 --> 3672.16]  the,
[3672.16 --> 3676.74]  the air fiber link between here and creator warehouse went out sometimes.
[3678.10 --> 3678.54]  Okay.
[3678.54 --> 3681.94]  But I think what we determined was the problem was that they were too close.
[3682.26 --> 3682.66]  Oh,
[3682.86 --> 3683.08]  no,
[3683.12 --> 3684.52]  they were too close to the roofs.
[3685.00 --> 3685.22]  Oh,
[3685.28 --> 3685.82]  was it that?
[3685.82 --> 3687.70]  I thought they were too close to each other.
[3687.94 --> 3688.14]  Oh,
[3688.22 --> 3688.42]  I mean,
[3688.52 --> 3690.80]  and they were designed for like a higher power or something.
[3690.98 --> 3691.66]  Might have changed,
[3691.74 --> 3693.92]  but I think there was some reflections for them being like,
[3693.96 --> 3694.88]  they're supposed to be in a post.
[3695.62 --> 3697.86]  We like got them to the ground.
[3698.22 --> 3698.82]  The swimming pool,
[3698.90 --> 3700.16]  water cooling works though.
[3700.26 --> 3700.44]  Yeah.
[3700.54 --> 3700.78]  Well,
[3700.82 --> 3705.56]  it does now after that fitting like corroded away and it leaked all over everything.
[3705.62 --> 3707.50]  I don't think that was like the concept.
[3707.60 --> 3707.70]  Yeah.
[3707.70 --> 3708.70]  It's also not that janky.
[3708.74 --> 3709.60]  It's actually pretty good.
[3709.72 --> 3709.98]  Yeah.
[3709.98 --> 3710.90]  Um,
[3711.02 --> 3711.98]  and it's like a thing.
[3712.60 --> 3713.04]  Oh,
[3713.34 --> 3713.60]  the,
[3713.80 --> 3713.88]  Oh,
[3713.94 --> 3714.70]  this one was funny.
[3714.80 --> 3715.42]  So the,
[3715.42 --> 3718.36]  the roof solar that's supposed to contribute to heating the pool,
[3718.46 --> 3719.82]  that one doesn't work at all.
[3719.94 --> 3720.34]  Oh,
[3720.42 --> 3721.62]  because they filled it.
[3722.30 --> 3724.66]  And I forgot that they told me they filled it,
[3724.74 --> 3725.86]  but they didn't glycol it.
[3726.28 --> 3727.98]  So last winter,
[3728.18 --> 3732.16]  everything blew up and it has to be like completely replumbed.
[3732.16 --> 3732.40]  Yeah.
[3732.40 --> 3733.82]  And I haven't gotten around to it.
[3734.12 --> 3734.36]  Yeah.
[3734.48 --> 3734.72]  Yeah.
[3734.90 --> 3735.68]  So that one,
[3735.76 --> 3736.48]  that one was bad.
[3736.64 --> 3737.02]  Speaking of which,
[3737.04 --> 3737.66]  how's the bike going?
[3738.34 --> 3738.60]  Yeah.
[3739.40 --> 3741.28]  Your bike is my final fantasy six.
[3741.34 --> 3742.04]  I made progress.
[3742.26 --> 3742.50]  Oh,
[3742.54 --> 3742.72]  okay.
[3742.82 --> 3744.84]  I made progress actually this while I was,
[3744.92 --> 3745.46]  while I was off.
[3745.58 --> 3745.84]  I,
[3745.92 --> 3746.24]  um,
[3746.92 --> 3747.30]  I,
[3747.58 --> 3748.22]  um,
[3748.30 --> 3749.76]  reset up everything.
[3749.76 --> 3751.60]  I added a second intake fan,
[3751.70 --> 3752.90]  so I have better positive pressure.
[3752.90 --> 3755.74]  So I was getting a little bit of dust on some of the previous parts.
[3755.88 --> 3755.98]  Yeah.
[3756.32 --> 3756.72]  Um,
[3756.72 --> 3758.08]  I remixed my primer,
[3758.36 --> 3762.38]  which had settled into water and mud and took probably,
[3762.40 --> 3762.86]  about 10,
[3762.94 --> 3763.58]  15 minutes.
[3763.58 --> 3764.30]  So with the,
[3764.36 --> 3764.78]  like the,
[3764.78 --> 3767.26]  the drill powered paint mixer to get to,
[3767.38 --> 3768.90]  to get going again.
[3769.32 --> 3769.76]  Um,
[3769.88 --> 3770.48]  I,
[3771.30 --> 3771.94]  um,
[3772.64 --> 3776.72]  I redid my hangers for the wheels because the ones I was using before made
[3776.72 --> 3777.74]  them kind of hard to maneuver.
[3777.98 --> 3781.26]  So I made new ones out of like chopsticks and then,
[3781.26 --> 3781.82]  um,
[3782.00 --> 3784.46]  aircraft wire and then like another chopstick so that it,
[3784.86 --> 3785.96]  instead of coming down like this,
[3786.02 --> 3787.60]  it comes down like this now.
[3787.68 --> 3789.22]  So it's a little bit easier to handle.
[3789.62 --> 3789.98]  Um,
[3790.06 --> 3790.46]  so no,
[3790.46 --> 3792.46]  I actually spent a few hours on it over the last,
[3792.62 --> 3793.08]  um,
[3793.14 --> 3793.92]  being off this week.
[3794.02 --> 3794.44]  Getting prepped.
[3794.50 --> 3795.06]  I'm getting it.
[3795.12 --> 3796.00]  I'm getting it going again.
[3796.04 --> 3798.46]  I got a space heater for the booth so that it won't get too,
[3798.58 --> 3798.90]  too low.
[3798.96 --> 3800.90]  I got that set up and made sure everything's good to go.
[3801.20 --> 3801.86]  So I'm,
[3801.90 --> 3802.44]  I'm actually,
[3802.70 --> 3804.00]  I'm actually good to get going again.
[3804.14 --> 3804.42]  Nice.
[3805.14 --> 3806.46]  I got this.
[3809.12 --> 3812.34]  Do a stream where Linus paints his bike and Luke plays Final Fantasy VI.
[3812.46 --> 3813.54]  First to finish wins.
[3815.10 --> 3816.52]  That's not a horrible idea.
[3816.52 --> 3818.02]  That's actually not a terrible idea.
[3820.20 --> 3821.42]  That'd probably be pretty fun,
[3821.48 --> 3821.74]  actually.
[3821.84 --> 3821.96]  I mean,
[3822.00 --> 3824.12]  you guys would just hang out in the shop together and,
[3824.28 --> 3824.82]  you know,
[3824.92 --> 3826.50]  Luke plays it on an ally or something.
[3826.70 --> 3826.90]  Yeah.
[3827.00 --> 3827.20]  There's,
[3827.20 --> 3827.50]  there's,
[3827.58 --> 3831.12]  there's a lot of multi-content style streaming that's happening these days.
[3831.12 --> 3831.58]  And like,
[3831.58 --> 3833.40]  even just multi-content content,
[3833.60 --> 3838.08]  like you look at the shorts with like the whatever racer thing going on while they talk about something else.
[3838.08 --> 3838.66]  Subway surfers.
[3838.74 --> 3838.86]  Yeah.
[3838.96 --> 3839.08]  Yeah.
[3839.08 --> 3839.14]  Yeah.
[3839.14 --> 3840.46]  Here's the problem though.
[3840.98 --> 3846.26]  These are projects that neither Luke nor I individually have managed to work on.
[3846.96 --> 3853.24]  Assuming that we are going to somehow align the stars so we can be in the same place at the same time doing it at the same time.
[3853.36 --> 3853.64]  I mean,
[3853.78 --> 3853.98]  Oh,
[3854.30 --> 3855.28]  yeah.
[3855.72 --> 3855.98]  Well,
[3856.14 --> 3856.60]  come on.
[3856.82 --> 3856.88]  Pause.
[3857.14 --> 3857.68]  Come on,
[3857.82 --> 3857.98]  man.
[3858.08 --> 3859.56]  Get your mind out of the gutter.
[3860.22 --> 3861.86]  Get your mind out of the gutter.
[3862.26 --> 3863.04]  It likes it there.
[3864.00 --> 3864.82]  It's comfortable.
[3865.18 --> 3865.82]  It's familiar.
[3865.82 --> 3865.90]  It's familiar.
[3865.90 --> 3871.90]  Oh,
[3872.54 --> 3872.86]  man.
[3873.08 --> 3874.34]  I didn't actually watch the video.
[3874.44 --> 3875.26]  Did they cut out my,
[3875.74 --> 3876.46]  did they cut out?
[3876.88 --> 3877.12]  All right.
[3877.18 --> 3877.32]  No,
[3877.40 --> 3877.58]  you know,
[3877.66 --> 3878.02]  nevermind.
[3878.06 --> 3878.60]  If they cut it out,
[3878.64 --> 3879.34]  then I'll leave it cut out.
[3880.22 --> 3880.62]  Okay.
[3880.72 --> 3881.54]  What are we supposed to be doing?
[3882.98 --> 3883.42]  Cool.
[3888.28 --> 3888.68]  The,
[3888.68 --> 3888.74]  the,
[3888.74 --> 3890.74]  the,
[3890.74 --> 3892.76]  the LTT commuter backpack announcement.
[3892.76 --> 3895.76]  Is that different than what we did for the merch messages call out?
[3895.90 --> 3896.66]  I don't think so.
[3896.78 --> 3897.02]  Okay.
[3897.30 --> 3897.60]  Uh,
[3897.60 --> 3898.92]  they just have cute links.
[3898.92 --> 3901.08]  If you go to LMG dot GG slash discount,
[3901.34 --> 3901.66]  please,
[3901.82 --> 3902.64]  then,
[3902.64 --> 3903.58]  um,
[3904.26 --> 3905.36]  it will take you to the store.
[3905.36 --> 3906.44]  And then when you add it to the card,
[3906.48 --> 3907.50]  it'll automatically be applied.
[3907.60 --> 3908.74]  So if you're having trouble,
[3909.24 --> 3910.90]  LMG dot GG slash discount,
[3911.06 --> 3911.28]  please.
[3911.48 --> 3912.66]  That brings you to the YouTube video.
[3912.86 --> 3913.14]  Oh,
[3913.70 --> 3913.96]  cool.
[3914.12 --> 3914.36]  All right.
[3914.36 --> 3914.76]  Slide again.
[3914.84 --> 3915.18]  See you later.
[3916.78 --> 3917.36]  Bad guy.
[3917.78 --> 3919.24]  And it's kind of however you want to spell it.
[3919.30 --> 3919.54]  Please.
[3919.64 --> 3920.12]  Full word.
[3920.84 --> 3921.28]  PLZ,
[3921.54 --> 3922.02]  PLS.
[3922.14 --> 3923.00]  Both of those were bad guy.
[3923.00 --> 3923.50]  All three of those.
[3924.14 --> 3924.54]  Um,
[3924.60 --> 3924.96]  all right.
[3925.68 --> 3926.12]  Um,
[3926.18 --> 3928.50]  I had a lot of fun hanging out with Colin smear.
[3929.04 --> 3929.40]  Yeah.
[3929.74 --> 3930.12]  It was good.
[3930.32 --> 3930.54]  Yeah.
[3930.70 --> 3930.90]  Uh,
[3930.90 --> 3931.54]  video went up.
[3931.66 --> 3932.16]  It's funny.
[3932.32 --> 3932.56]  They,
[3932.68 --> 3933.04]  um,
[3933.76 --> 3935.64]  I,
[3935.74 --> 3936.24]  I just,
[3936.36 --> 3936.60]  I,
[3936.64 --> 3937.04]  I,
[3937.04 --> 3938.24]  I felt like,
[3938.74 --> 3940.30]  I,
[3940.42 --> 3940.84]  I don't know.
[3940.90 --> 3942.16]  I felt like they did a really good job.
[3942.42 --> 3943.26]  They just kind of,
[3943.26 --> 3943.58]  man,
[3943.66 --> 3944.94]  the dossier they had on me.
[3945.24 --> 3945.50]  Yeah.
[3945.60 --> 3947.54]  I don't think that made it into the cut,
[3947.54 --> 3949.06]  but they had like,
[3949.48 --> 3951.52]  they had like a book this thick on me.
[3951.56 --> 3953.22]  It included everything from like,
[3953.66 --> 3953.90]  like,
[3953.96 --> 3958.92]  like AI summaries that were full of mistakes to like a printout of the Wikipedia,
[3959.28 --> 3961.38]  which I think might also have some mistakes on it.
[3961.62 --> 3963.36]  But they also had,
[3963.44 --> 3964.46]  um,
[3964.58 --> 3969.02]  like past sort of times I've addressed stuff or stories that I've told on like
[3969.02 --> 3970.82]  WAN shows that they had all these like citations.
[3970.84 --> 3971.78]  Like they had a whole,
[3972.26 --> 3973.84]  clearly they have someone who,
[3974.72 --> 3977.84]  or either they do it or someone on their team does it where they go through
[3977.84 --> 3980.10]  and they have like a whole like,
[3980.20 --> 3983.36]  like background check process for guests on their show.
[3983.92 --> 3984.36]  Um,
[3984.80 --> 3990.20]  which makes me all the more surprised that they decided to host me given how
[3990.20 --> 3991.12]  controversial I am.
[3991.90 --> 3995.00]  It was actually really interesting reading through,
[3995.00 --> 3995.60]  uh,
[3995.60 --> 3997.34]  both that and,
[3997.34 --> 3997.62]  uh,
[3997.62 --> 3998.06]  assumptions.
[3999.22 --> 3999.70]  Yeah.
[3999.70 --> 4002.66]  Reading through sort of like the audience questions.
[4002.66 --> 4004.74]  And then in the case of Colin and Samir,
[4004.92 --> 4009.60]  the questions beforehand compared to the comments on the video itself.
[4009.60 --> 4010.26]  Like it's,
[4010.38 --> 4011.40]  I noticed that too.
[4011.76 --> 4014.68]  It is a stark difference.
[4014.84 --> 4015.48]  It really is.
[4015.56 --> 4017.70]  What the like terminal,
[4018.86 --> 4026.74]  terminally online commenters want to talk about versus what people who actually watch a video care about.
[4026.74 --> 4029.98]  No relation to each other whatsoever.
[4030.66 --> 4031.06]  Um,
[4031.10 --> 4031.40]  anyway,
[4031.58 --> 4031.98]  it was,
[4032.08 --> 4032.92]  it was a lot of,
[4032.96 --> 4033.60]  it was a lot of fun.
[4033.68 --> 4039.16]  I was very surprised to see the final cut and that it was like two hours long.
[4039.16 --> 4042.02]  Cause we only sat down for a little over two hours.
[4042.02 --> 4042.64]  Like I don't,
[4042.80 --> 4045.40]  I don't think they ultimately cut that much out of it.
[4045.40 --> 4045.84]  I think,
[4045.84 --> 4046.64]  uh,
[4046.82 --> 4048.62]  Colton had asked to have a look at it,
[4048.68 --> 4050.42]  but I never had a look at the,
[4050.52 --> 4051.62]  at the cut before they,
[4051.78 --> 4052.70]  before they uploaded it.
[4053.32 --> 4053.72]  Um,
[4054.52 --> 4055.78]  I skipped through parts of it.
[4055.84 --> 4056.16]  I haven't,
[4056.26 --> 4056.58]  it's obviously,
[4056.58 --> 4057.18]  it's long.
[4057.34 --> 4059.40]  I don't think you need to watch it.
[4059.50 --> 4059.84]  Like you,
[4059.84 --> 4061.04]  you literally watch,
[4061.14 --> 4061.94]  you live through,
[4062.14 --> 4063.46]  you survive.
[4064.04 --> 4064.48]  Sorry.
[4064.52 --> 4067.26]  I keep changing the language here to better reflect the situation.
[4067.62 --> 4069.42]  The WAN show every week.
[4069.42 --> 4071.22]  So I don't think you need to.
[4071.62 --> 4071.98]  Yeah.
[4072.02 --> 4072.44]  And you were,
[4072.64 --> 4075.48]  you were there for a lot of the stories that I was telling.
[4075.48 --> 4076.54]  So there really isn't,
[4076.64 --> 4077.40]  I don't think.
[4077.40 --> 4081.40]  I just wanted to see like what the vibe was basically that that was all I was
[4081.40 --> 4081.88]  really doing.
[4081.88 --> 4082.14]  And it,
[4082.14 --> 4083.54]  it seemed pretty good.
[4083.60 --> 4084.94]  I didn't sleep well the night before.
[4084.94 --> 4085.86]  I'll tell you that much.
[4085.96 --> 4088.40]  You seemed fairly relaxed though.
[4088.94 --> 4090.12]  I was trying to be.
[4090.18 --> 4090.42]  Yeah.
[4090.66 --> 4090.96]  I mean,
[4090.98 --> 4091.50]  I don't know.
[4091.50 --> 4092.06]  It's like,
[4092.06 --> 4093.50]  um,
[4093.96 --> 4094.36]  like I thought,
[4094.40 --> 4095.44]  I thought that was pretty good.
[4095.84 --> 4096.60]  Like we,
[4096.78 --> 4097.22]  we,
[4097.42 --> 4099.30]  we wanted a chance to,
[4099.42 --> 4103.36]  to kind of talk to an audience other than just our own audience.
[4103.36 --> 4104.02]  That's why we,
[4104.12 --> 4105.38]  that's why we went down and,
[4105.38 --> 4105.76]  uh,
[4106.16 --> 4106.36]  you know,
[4106.36 --> 4109.82]  did it in their studio and why we went down and did assumptions as well.
[4110.28 --> 4110.72]  Um,
[4110.72 --> 4111.68]  I think that,
[4111.68 --> 4112.18]  you know,
[4112.18 --> 4112.52]  for,
[4112.78 --> 4114.64]  for a while I've been a bit of a shut in,
[4114.72 --> 4116.64]  like there's been some exceptions lately.
[4116.64 --> 4117.46]  We've done some,
[4117.56 --> 4119.60]  some fun collabs like with mighty car mods.
[4120.08 --> 4120.50]  Uh,
[4120.56 --> 4121.30]  but like,
[4121.36 --> 4124.82]  I've never really done like the,
[4124.86 --> 4127.12]  the interview circuit or anything like that.
[4127.12 --> 4128.04]  Like it was very,
[4128.04 --> 4128.94]  you know,
[4128.94 --> 4131.26]  generous of Ludwig to invite me to the yard,
[4131.26 --> 4132.08]  but I,
[4132.08 --> 4134.18]  I've never really gone out and been like,
[4134.40 --> 4134.54]  Hey,
[4134.58 --> 4136.66]  do you need a guest for your show before that?
[4136.76 --> 4137.28]  I can remember.
[4137.90 --> 4138.30]  Um,
[4138.46 --> 4139.24]  and,
[4139.44 --> 4139.60]  uh,
[4139.60 --> 4142.06]  it was fun actually.
[4142.90 --> 4143.32]  Yeah.
[4143.42 --> 4143.60]  Yeah.
[4143.60 --> 4144.00]  It was fun.
[4144.14 --> 4148.96]  It was cool to see how many people in our audience caught that the collab was coming
[4148.96 --> 4152.42]  when we shot our arc battle mage video in their studio.
[4152.42 --> 4154.06]  Oh,
[4154.74 --> 4155.10]  yeah.
[4155.38 --> 4158.32]  Cause like their audience obviously knew cause they posted ahead of time.
[4158.38 --> 4158.48]  Hey,
[4158.48 --> 4159.80]  do you have any questions for Linus?
[4159.84 --> 4160.48]  Which by the way,
[4160.48 --> 4161.34]  as far as I can tell,
[4161.38 --> 4165.36]  they completely ignored cause they had their own questions ready.
[4165.56 --> 4168.76]  And I read through the questions that people asked on Twitter and stuff.
[4168.78 --> 4169.06]  I was like,
[4169.06 --> 4170.36]  I don't remember seeing any of this.
[4170.52 --> 4170.74]  Yeah.
[4170.82 --> 4171.00]  Yeah.
[4171.00 --> 4171.24]  Yeah.
[4171.88 --> 4172.28]  But,
[4172.36 --> 4172.58]  uh,
[4172.70 --> 4172.98]  but yeah,
[4172.98 --> 4173.18]  I,
[4173.18 --> 4173.68]  I was,
[4174.32 --> 4177.12]  cause I've watched some of their content before to sort of like,
[4177.22 --> 4177.56]  I don't know.
[4177.56 --> 4178.02]  I think it's,
[4178.02 --> 4179.60]  they actually do some really interesting stuff.
[4179.66 --> 4179.76]  Yeah.
[4179.82 --> 4180.04]  They're,
[4180.12 --> 4182.02]  they're like the creators,
[4182.24 --> 4185.64]  YouTube metagame about creators for creators channel.
[4185.70 --> 4186.00]  Yeah.
[4186.16 --> 4186.36]  Yeah.
[4186.42 --> 4186.56]  It's,
[4186.56 --> 4186.82]  it's,
[4186.90 --> 4188.18]  I've watched quite a bit of their stuff.
[4188.30 --> 4188.74]  Um,
[4188.90 --> 4190.16]  and something that I've,
[4190.22 --> 4195.66]  I've noticed is that people tend to be pretty relaxed and pretty open.
[4195.66 --> 4197.40]  And I was like,
[4197.42 --> 4197.60]  okay,
[4197.64 --> 4199.98]  is Linus going to go like presenter style?
[4199.98 --> 4200.28]  Like,
[4200.32 --> 4202.74]  will you have come off just filming something an hour before?
[4202.74 --> 4206.18]  Because that's normal and be like in like presenter mode.
[4206.18 --> 4206.68]  And then no,
[4206.74 --> 4207.20]  like you were,
[4207.28 --> 4208.10]  you were kind of chilling,
[4208.38 --> 4209.30]  having an open conversation.
[4209.46 --> 4210.08]  So I think it was,
[4210.16 --> 4213.98]  I think it was good that Colton and I went together because we talked for
[4213.98 --> 4215.78]  like four hours on the flight down there.
[4215.84 --> 4219.52]  So maybe I was just in like chill chatting about the business mode because
[4219.52 --> 4224.82]  realistically both of us are the kind of people that just never turn
[4224.82 --> 4225.10]  off.
[4225.32 --> 4225.60]  Yeah.
[4226.04 --> 4226.78]  So we,
[4226.92 --> 4231.28]  we literally talked for like four hours on the flight down there.
[4231.38 --> 4232.60]  Like didn't shut up the whole time.
[4232.66 --> 4236.12]  I'm sorry to anyone who was on that flight from YVR to LAX.
[4236.24 --> 4236.38]  My,
[4236.42 --> 4237.06]  my apologies.
[4238.60 --> 4239.00]  Yeah.
[4239.48 --> 4239.88]  Um,
[4240.66 --> 4242.70]  someone saying I should go on Joe Rogan.
[4242.82 --> 4244.16]  I've had that suggested before.
[4244.26 --> 4244.48]  A,
[4244.52 --> 4245.38]  I've never been invited.
[4245.86 --> 4246.04]  B,
[4246.12 --> 4247.38]  I don't know what we'd talk about.
[4247.66 --> 4247.96]  I,
[4248.04 --> 4251.14]  I literally have no idea because I,
[4251.54 --> 4252.70]  I find,
[4252.70 --> 4255.62]  I am very knowledgeable about a niche,
[4255.66 --> 4257.00]  that as far as I can tell,
[4257.00 --> 4259.08]  almost no one cares about,
[4259.28 --> 4261.44]  which is like tech YouTube,
[4261.44 --> 4265.86]  because a lot of what I know is not even necessarily applicable to non,
[4266.66 --> 4268.42]  like non tech or non,
[4268.54 --> 4269.12]  at least,
[4269.12 --> 4270.52]  um,
[4270.52 --> 4272.08]  tangentially related,
[4272.08 --> 4272.62]  like,
[4272.68 --> 4273.98]  like science or,
[4273.98 --> 4274.50]  you know,
[4274.54 --> 4275.02]  education,
[4275.18 --> 4275.52]  YouTube,
[4275.52 --> 4276.14]  or like,
[4276.14 --> 4276.76]  like you could,
[4276.98 --> 4282.68]  like you could kind of find ones that are like kind of similar where you're trying to present information and also make it entertaining or whatever else.
[4282.68 --> 4286.06]  Yeah.
[4286.90 --> 4287.38]  Um,
[4287.46 --> 4290.08]  next topic.
[4291.56 --> 4292.04]  Yeah.
[4292.10 --> 4295.26]  Scrappy DP says he doesn't know who you are a hundred percent.
[4295.50 --> 4298.66]  He has absolutely no idea who I am.
[4298.74 --> 4298.86]  I,
[4298.94 --> 4300.70]  I don't think I've ever seen him operate a computer.
[4301.18 --> 4301.66]  So,
[4301.66 --> 4302.86]  um,
[4303.28 --> 4304.66]  I think his,
[4304.80 --> 4305.14]  uh,
[4305.22 --> 4305.34]  I,
[4305.50 --> 4309.72]  I think his producer at some point or something talked about the screwdriver though.
[4309.72 --> 4313.44]  Red ban is not his producer,
[4313.72 --> 4318.04]  but has worked with him in the past and definitely knows who we are for sure.
[4319.38 --> 4319.86]  Um,
[4319.96 --> 4320.32]  he,
[4320.46 --> 4322.22]  he's like the,
[4322.22 --> 4327.14]  what is the kill Tony?
[4327.88 --> 4328.32]  Oh,
[4328.38 --> 4328.54]  okay.
[4328.56 --> 4328.78]  Okay.
[4328.78 --> 4329.00]  Okay.
[4329.00 --> 4330.24]  That's the one I'm thinking about.
[4330.64 --> 4331.08]  Yep.
[4331.34 --> 4331.72]  But I,
[4331.72 --> 4334.44]  I think he used to work with Joe Rogan in the,
[4334.52 --> 4335.82]  in the way past or something.
[4336.00 --> 4336.42]  Got it.
[4336.42 --> 4336.68]  Got it.
[4336.68 --> 4336.94]  Got it.
[4336.94 --> 4337.20]  Got it.
[4337.20 --> 4337.52]  Got it.
[4337.52 --> 4337.76]  Okay.
[4337.76 --> 4338.00]  Red,
[4338.00 --> 4338.82]  red bands weren't like,
[4338.86 --> 4339.46]  he's had like,
[4339.72 --> 4340.98]  I think he's talked about screwdriver.
[4341.28 --> 4342.36]  He's worn a,
[4342.36 --> 4342.76]  uh,
[4342.76 --> 4346.02]  an LTX sweater on one of the kill Tonys in the past.
[4346.78 --> 4347.30]  Um,
[4348.00 --> 4348.22]  cool.
[4348.40 --> 4348.60]  Yeah.
[4348.68 --> 4350.82]  So he's definitely been around.
[4351.04 --> 4351.52]  Also,
[4351.68 --> 4353.64]  I think I don't remember.
[4356.04 --> 4356.56]  Uh,
[4357.20 --> 4362.18]  I guess this would be before you were doing YouTube stuff,
[4362.36 --> 4367.50]  but I thought Joe Rogan was really into like quake.
[4368.42 --> 4369.16]  I've heard that.
[4369.16 --> 4371.92]  And doing land stuff back in the day.
[4371.92 --> 4372.34]  I don't know.
[4372.70 --> 4374.52]  That would have had to be like a thousand years ago.
[4374.52 --> 4375.94]  It would have been a long time ago.
[4378.72 --> 4379.40]  All right.
[4381.08 --> 4381.66]  Melody Bun,
[4381.72 --> 4384.22]  there is no risk of me going on Rogan.
[4384.46 --> 4385.98]  They're begging me not to go on.
[4386.30 --> 4386.70]  Like,
[4386.80 --> 4387.94]  I have not been invited.
[4388.38 --> 4390.16]  He literally doesn't know who I am.
[4390.16 --> 4390.62]  It's fine.
[4391.22 --> 4391.86]  Just chill.
[4391.86 --> 4392.58]  Linus,
[4392.64 --> 4392.92]  do you think,
[4393.00 --> 4393.28]  uh,
[4393.28 --> 4394.86]  like a gorilla could play badminton?
[4395.68 --> 4396.08]  Sorry,
[4396.20 --> 4396.38]  what?
[4396.78 --> 4397.22]  You know,
[4397.30 --> 4398.16]  like a gorilla,
[4398.32 --> 4399.72]  like they're pretty strong and like fast.
[4400.04 --> 4400.16]  Do you,
[4400.20 --> 4400.58]  what do you think?
[4400.98 --> 4401.36]  Are you,
[4401.46 --> 4403.80]  are you saying I should play Joe Rogan in badminton?
[4404.08 --> 4404.26]  No,
[4404.36 --> 4404.46]  no,
[4404.46 --> 4404.58]  no,
[4404.58 --> 4404.68]  no.
[4404.72 --> 4405.74]  Like I got like a gorilla.
[4405.90 --> 4406.86]  Do you think that could play badminton?
[4406.86 --> 4408.30]  He's trying to be Joe Rogan.
[4408.42 --> 4409.60]  I'm prepping you for your interview.
[4409.82 --> 4412.24]  I've never watched the Rogan experience.
[4412.44 --> 4412.58]  Okay.
[4412.70 --> 4413.10]  I've,
[4413.10 --> 4415.24]  I've seen the occasional clip here and there.
[4415.48 --> 4415.88]  Like,
[4415.92 --> 4417.36]  are those the kind of questions he asks?
[4418.20 --> 4418.60]  I don't know.
[4418.64 --> 4418.94]  I don't,
[4419.06 --> 4420.44]  I've seen clips like that.
[4420.44 --> 4424.54]  There's like a meme that all his interviews turn into him talking about like,
[4424.86 --> 4426.94]  what if this was a giant scary animal?
[4427.26 --> 4428.56]  And could you like take it on?
[4430.64 --> 4434.04]  So it doesn't matter that you're a tech YouTuber because you won't be talking about that.
[4434.38 --> 4435.02]  I see.
[4435.02 --> 4436.06]  It's like that.
[4436.40 --> 4436.72]  Uh,
[4436.72 --> 4438.08]  I think the whole thing is like,
[4438.12 --> 4438.26]  yeah,
[4438.30 --> 4438.54]  like,
[4438.68 --> 4440.18]  could you fight a bear slash?
[4440.32 --> 4441.52]  Have you done DMT before?
[4441.72 --> 4442.40]  That's the meme.
[4442.46 --> 4443.52]  I think that's DMT.
[4443.84 --> 4444.50]  I was going to,
[4444.56 --> 4445.32]  I was going to mention that,
[4445.40 --> 4446.16]  but didn't drug.
[4446.50 --> 4446.78]  Oh,
[4446.80 --> 4447.08]  okay.
[4447.08 --> 4447.84]  What is it though?
[4448.28 --> 4448.96]  I don't know.
[4449.96 --> 4450.40]  Dimethyltryptamine.
[4451.16 --> 4453.56]  I think the answer is you have not.
[4453.90 --> 4453.92]  Well,
[4453.92 --> 4454.08]  yeah,
[4454.16 --> 4454.44]  I mean,
[4454.50 --> 4455.06]  obviously,
[4455.34 --> 4455.68]  um,
[4456.04 --> 4456.98]  but like what's it's,
[4456.98 --> 4457.32]  well,
[4457.36 --> 4458.48]  what's it's colloquial name?
[4459.52 --> 4459.92]  DMT.
[4460.38 --> 4461.86]  Man versus Joe Rogan in a cage.
[4462.00 --> 4462.94]  That would end poorly.
[4464.16 --> 4465.00]  He might be,
[4465.02 --> 4465.28]  old,
[4465.38 --> 4466.94]  but he's still a lot bigger than me.
[4467.24 --> 4470.66]  He's going to do one of those spinny kicks and send us into orbit.
[4472.28 --> 4472.64]  Uh,
[4473.68 --> 4475.98]  Dimitri and Fantasia.
[4477.56 --> 4479.84]  Schedule one controlled substance in the United States.
[4480.02 --> 4480.18]  Blah,
[4480.20 --> 4480.34]  blah,
[4480.42 --> 4480.68]  blah,
[4480.86 --> 4481.04]  blah,
[4481.10 --> 4481.26]  blah.
[4481.38 --> 4481.52]  Oh,
[4481.52 --> 4481.76]  okay.
[4481.88 --> 4482.10]  Okay.
[4482.10 --> 4483.46]  So it's just called by other names.
[4483.54 --> 4484.38]  It's called DMT.
[4484.76 --> 4485.00]  Yeah.
[4485.46 --> 4485.94]  Um,
[4486.66 --> 4488.54]  okay.
[4488.68 --> 4489.00]  Well,
[4489.08 --> 4489.38]  I mean,
[4489.38 --> 4490.46]  now I know about that.
[4490.86 --> 4492.48]  So if I ever get into my,
[4492.62 --> 4492.94]  when I,
[4493.02 --> 4493.14]  yeah,
[4493.14 --> 4495.28]  when I start my hookers and blow arc,
[4495.36 --> 4496.28]  then I'll,
[4496.40 --> 4498.32]  I'll have another DMT and bears.
[4498.32 --> 4501.40]  I would work in Vancouver.
[4501.54 --> 4502.12]  I'll tell you that.
[4511.58 --> 4513.54]  Please tell me the bear thing was intentional.
[4513.54 --> 4518.70]  I'm sorry.
[4519.18 --> 4520.08]  I'm going to shut up.
[4521.08 --> 4521.82]  Oh man.
[4523.12 --> 4523.46]  I mean,
[4523.48 --> 4525.84]  I feel like I'm overdue for a real scandal,
[4526.04 --> 4526.36]  you know?
[4526.64 --> 4526.88]  Like,
[4526.90 --> 4527.44]  I feel like,
[4527.50 --> 4528.82]  I feel like to put in con,
[4528.90 --> 4530.20]  to put things in context,
[4530.20 --> 4531.06]  I need to like,
[4531.48 --> 4533.42]  like run over some orphans or something,
[4533.58 --> 4533.82]  you know?
[4533.82 --> 4536.02]  because then me not,
[4536.26 --> 4537.64]  me not talking about,
[4537.76 --> 4538.08]  you know,
[4538.14 --> 4543.16]  a sponsor that we haven't worked with in three years will be just,
[4544.20 --> 4547.14]  people will be able to put it in the correct context,
[4547.38 --> 4547.70]  you know?
[4547.80 --> 4548.10]  Yeah.
[4548.34 --> 4548.56]  Like,
[4548.58 --> 4548.86]  come on,
[4548.88 --> 4549.18]  tell me,
[4549.26 --> 4549.78]  tell me what,
[4549.84 --> 4550.08]  what,
[4550.08 --> 4551.48]  what scandal do you guys want?
[4551.68 --> 4553.00]  You want like a good one?
[4553.26 --> 4553.42]  Not,
[4553.58 --> 4553.74]  yeah.
[4553.86 --> 4554.14]  Don't,
[4554.22 --> 4554.88]  you know,
[4556.02 --> 4557.74]  don't run over orphans.
[4557.84 --> 4558.36]  Give me something,
[4558.52 --> 4558.88]  you know,
[4558.98 --> 4559.48]  speeding.
[4559.70 --> 4560.40]  Come on.
[4562.02 --> 4562.66]  I mean,
[4563.16 --> 4563.40]  that,
[4563.40 --> 4564.22]  that was another,
[4564.34 --> 4570.66]  that was another funny one to me just cause like the fact that every other car YouTuber does blur their speedo,
[4570.82 --> 4573.40]  does that make what they're doing like any,
[4573.58 --> 4575.74]  the fact that they successfully blur their speedo,
[4575.80 --> 4577.06]  does that make it like better?
[4579.88 --> 4580.32]  Like,
[4580.38 --> 4585.02]  I'm not saying that it's a good thing to do that you should just rip around on public roads.
[4585.26 --> 4586.06]  Wasn't he in a school zone?
[4586.92 --> 4587.36]  He was,
[4587.50 --> 4588.24]  there was a,
[4588.34 --> 4588.78]  I didn't really,
[4588.86 --> 4592.12]  there was a children at play sign of some sort,
[4592.12 --> 4596.00]  but I don't think there's any concrete evidence that it was in effect.
[4596.10 --> 4597.72]  It may have been time delimited.
[4597.96 --> 4598.18]  Got it.
[4598.24 --> 4598.46]  Okay.
[4599.04 --> 4599.12]  Um,
[4599.12 --> 4599.38]  like,
[4603.54 --> 4603.84]  dude,
[4603.92 --> 4604.46]  there was that,
[4604.54 --> 4609.72]  there was that scrapyard wars when I was literally texting while driving in scrapyard wars.
[4609.78 --> 4611.86]  And I'm not saying that's good and you shouldn't do that.
[4611.86 --> 4612.66]  Um,
[4613.08 --> 4615.78]  it was a different time for real.
[4615.90 --> 4617.54]  And that's not a good excuse.
[4617.54 --> 4619.14]  Like distracted driving is terrible.
[4619.36 --> 4619.52]  Yeah.
[4619.56 --> 4620.74]  I'm just saying that like,
[4621.08 --> 4622.08]  it was,
[4622.74 --> 4623.60]  it was,
[4623.68 --> 4632.76]  it was interesting to watch how eager people were to like nail Marquez to the cross for that one.
[4633.42 --> 4635.26]  And I'm not saying what he did was right.
[4635.44 --> 4637.20]  And the timing sucked.
[4637.20 --> 4639.50]  I think coming right on the heels of the,
[4639.50 --> 4639.84]  um,
[4639.90 --> 4641.12]  I think that's most of it to be honest.
[4641.42 --> 4641.54]  Yeah.
[4641.56 --> 4641.90]  I don't know.
[4641.96 --> 4646.68]  I feel like a lot of what's gone on with us has been blood in the water.
[4647.02 --> 4653.94]  A has been a significant amount of residual anger that goes all the way back to ad block is piracy.
[4654.18 --> 4654.58]  Yeah,
[4654.58 --> 4654.92]  probably.
[4655.34 --> 4659.56]  I think that was our first thing where people felt like personally attacked,
[4659.56 --> 4660.50]  even though I never said,
[4660.66 --> 4660.98]  don't do it.
[4661.04 --> 4661.54]  And there's a,
[4661.62 --> 4663.08]  there's a certain degree that you get to,
[4663.12 --> 4664.54]  I've had this conversation with a few people.
[4664.74 --> 4664.94]  Yeah.
[4664.94 --> 4665.10]  Uh,
[4665.10 --> 4667.02]  there's a certain degree that you get to when,
[4667.48 --> 4667.84]  uh,
[4667.94 --> 4672.84]  it is encouraged and,
[4672.84 --> 4673.42]  uh,
[4673.58 --> 4677.32]  cheered on by the community to attack a person or a group of people.
[4678.10 --> 4678.62]  Um,
[4678.62 --> 4679.02]  so it,
[4679.02 --> 4680.76]  it ends up being like the safe route.
[4681.78 --> 4682.20]  Like,
[4682.22 --> 4682.48]  I think,
[4682.56 --> 4689.04]  I think I can think of one particular point in time where it was the safe route to throw at us with everything you could.
[4689.44 --> 4689.58]  Oh yeah.
[4689.60 --> 4690.04]  A hundred percent.
[4690.16 --> 4693.10]  So like anything else would have gotten you like destroyed.
[4693.20 --> 4694.24]  Even if you said nothing,
[4694.24 --> 4694.98]  even if you said nothing,
[4695.04 --> 4696.90]  you would have looked like evil or something.
[4696.98 --> 4697.58]  So then like,
[4697.66 --> 4698.02]  and that,
[4698.10 --> 4700.62]  that residuals for a long time.
[4700.78 --> 4701.22]  I think it,
[4701.26 --> 4702.22]  I don't think it goes away.
[4702.56 --> 4703.16]  Potentially ever.
[4703.26 --> 4703.38]  Yeah.
[4703.42 --> 4703.88]  I'm not,
[4703.92 --> 4705.18]  I'm not convinced it goes away.
[4705.48 --> 4705.84]  Okay.
[4705.98 --> 4706.66]  So hold on a second.
[4706.72 --> 4707.12]  Hold on a second.
[4707.30 --> 4707.50]  We've got,
[4707.50 --> 4709.12]  we've got suggestions though.
[4709.38 --> 4712.10]  We've got suggestions for a proper scandal.
[4712.78 --> 4713.14]  Um,
[4713.14 --> 4714.70]  okay.
[4715.12 --> 4715.60]  Hmm.
[4715.60 --> 4716.04]  Interesting.
[4716.70 --> 4718.50]  Linus is actually six foot five.
[4720.80 --> 4722.00]  Lied the whole time.
[4722.08 --> 4722.70]  That's good.
[4722.92 --> 4723.20]  Nice.
[4723.30 --> 4723.64]  That's good.
[4723.88 --> 4724.56]  Dracus asks,
[4724.66 --> 4725.80]  how were the ditty parties?
[4726.88 --> 4727.36]  Dude,
[4727.52 --> 4732.38]  if you think I am anywhere near cool enough to be invited to a music industry party,
[4732.62 --> 4734.08]  please.
[4734.08 --> 4736.00]  Again,
[4736.12 --> 4737.42]  Joe Rogan doesn't know who he is.
[4740.70 --> 4742.24]  Remember when we talked recently,
[4742.24 --> 4742.92]  um,
[4742.92 --> 4746.58]  I'm not trying to say he's associated to ditty just before people freak out.
[4747.24 --> 4748.32]  It's already starting.
[4748.56 --> 4749.30]  Oh no,
[4749.84 --> 4751.54]  that was not my point at all.
[4752.26 --> 4752.74]  Um,
[4752.82 --> 4758.46]  remember when we were talking recently about like celebrities that I've met and I couldn't,
[4758.46 --> 4759.62]  I couldn't think of any.
[4759.86 --> 4759.88]  Yeah.
[4759.98 --> 4760.12]  Yeah.
[4760.22 --> 4760.32]  Yeah.
[4760.50 --> 4762.34]  Like even Seth Curry,
[4762.72 --> 4763.04]  the,
[4763.12 --> 4763.58]  the like,
[4763.58 --> 4766.28]  the lesser Curry still great,
[4766.68 --> 4768.76]  still great NBA player.
[4768.92 --> 4769.84]  I don't watch,
[4769.92 --> 4770.58]  I don't watch basketball,
[4770.58 --> 4772.10]  but still my understanding,
[4772.22 --> 4772.92]  I looked at his stats.
[4772.98 --> 4774.02]  I creeped the stats and they were good.
[4774.38 --> 4774.74]  Um,
[4774.74 --> 4775.54]  still great,
[4775.64 --> 4776.28]  but like,
[4776.78 --> 4778.10]  I haven't met anybody.
[4778.20 --> 4779.00]  I don't know anybody.
[4779.12 --> 4779.52]  I don't.
[4779.60 --> 4779.74]  Wait,
[4779.78 --> 4780.56]  the lesser Curry.
[4780.66 --> 4781.86]  Who's the greater Curry?
[4782.42 --> 4782.74]  Um,
[4782.82 --> 4783.08]  Steph.
[4783.98 --> 4784.38]  Oh,
[4784.64 --> 4784.78]  yeah.
[4784.78 --> 4785.52]  They had two kids.
[4785.52 --> 4786.98]  They named them Steph and Seth.
[4787.70 --> 4787.98]  Yeah.
[4789.00 --> 4789.56]  Good thinking.
[4789.76 --> 4790.18]  I don't watch.
[4790.40 --> 4790.86]  I don't watch.
[4791.10 --> 4792.14]  I thought they were the same person.
[4792.26 --> 4792.44]  No,
[4792.50 --> 4792.90]  not even.
[4793.04 --> 4793.32]  Okay.
[4793.32 --> 4793.64]  Yeah.
[4793.70 --> 4794.10]  Not even.
[4794.34 --> 4794.54]  All right.
[4794.74 --> 4795.06]  Um,
[4796.42 --> 4796.66]  Oh yeah,
[4796.68 --> 4797.26]  I met dead mouse.
[4797.98 --> 4798.60]  I mean,
[4798.74 --> 4801.00]  Joel's kind of niche famous too,
[4801.08 --> 4801.28]  though.
[4801.38 --> 4801.94]  I think so.
[4802.38 --> 4803.12]  Like he's like,
[4803.16 --> 4804.48]  if you're into EDM now,
[4804.60 --> 4805.14]  I think so.
[4805.20 --> 4806.56]  And you don't know who dead mouse is.
[4806.62 --> 4807.08]  You're like,
[4807.92 --> 4809.82]  like a cultural moron basically.
[4809.82 --> 4812.60]  But if you're not into EDM and you don't know who dead mouse is,
[4812.66 --> 4813.02]  like,
[4813.08 --> 4813.28]  yeah,
[4813.66 --> 4815.90]  like he had like one song on the radio.
[4816.78 --> 4817.12]  Like,
[4817.12 --> 4817.72]  let's be real.
[4819.98 --> 4823.98]  And I think in our age bracket and pretty much everybody knew,
[4824.06 --> 4825.20]  I think pretty much everybody knew,
[4825.28 --> 4826.00]  but outside of that,
[4826.12 --> 4826.34]  please.
[4826.72 --> 4826.80]  Yeah,
[4826.80 --> 4827.44]  that's probably true.
[4827.52 --> 4827.66]  Yeah.
[4827.88 --> 4828.22]  Come on.
[4828.38 --> 4828.56]  Yeah.
[4828.56 --> 4829.24]  Um,
[4829.48 --> 4830.44]  and Joel's super cool.
[4830.66 --> 4830.92]  Nothing,
[4831.00 --> 4832.14]  nothing against him or anything.
[4832.28 --> 4832.38]  Yeah.
[4832.50 --> 4832.92]  But when,
[4833.02 --> 4833.78]  when you talk like,
[4833.82 --> 4834.78]  like famous famous,
[4834.92 --> 4835.54]  I mean,
[4835.84 --> 4837.08]  I did meet Paris Hilton.
[4838.50 --> 4838.90]  Okay.
[4839.02 --> 4839.96]  I was in the same room.
[4840.28 --> 4840.52]  And I,
[4840.64 --> 4840.88]  Did you meet her?
[4840.98 --> 4841.70]  Were you in the same room?
[4841.84 --> 4842.96]  I complained about her.
[4842.96 --> 4844.18]  Did you meet her?
[4844.30 --> 4845.94]  Were you complaining about her in the same room?
[4846.60 --> 4847.00]  Uh,
[4847.04 --> 4848.98]  she uploaded that Christmas video of her naked.
[4850.10 --> 4851.46]  So I would say that I,
[4851.58 --> 4855.56]  I would say that I've actually seen more of her than most people in my life.
[4858.86 --> 4859.70]  That is not,
[4859.78 --> 4860.50]  that is a,
[4860.64 --> 4860.92]  Hmm.
[4861.10 --> 4861.46]  Wow.
[4861.86 --> 4867.02]  That is a very positively parasocial thing for everyone that enjoys OnlyFans.
[4867.14 --> 4871.40]  I think all the OnlyFans enjoyers are like,
[4871.46 --> 4871.86]  yeah,
[4871.92 --> 4872.16]  I know.
[4872.16 --> 4873.26]  I've seen a lot of them.
[4874.04 --> 4874.44]  Yeah.
[4874.56 --> 4875.98]  She's disrupting the market.
[4877.82 --> 4878.22]  If,
[4878.22 --> 4878.52]  if,
[4878.52 --> 4881.98]  if Joe Rogan did know who you were and invited you,
[4882.14 --> 4882.94]  would you go on?
[4883.14 --> 4883.44]  Uh,
[4883.48 --> 4887.34]  I think I would probably leave it to the management team.
[4887.86 --> 4888.76]  So I think it'd be fine.
[4888.84 --> 4889.36]  I'd probably have,
[4889.36 --> 4889.52]  well,
[4889.58 --> 4891.12]  then you feel free to cast your vote,
[4891.20 --> 4892.54]  but I don't think I'd weigh in on that.
[4892.64 --> 4893.38]  I think that's,
[4893.48 --> 4898.10]  I think that's something I'd let the team decide because that way I get plausible deniability.
[4898.10 --> 4898.90]  I can just be like,
[4898.98 --> 4899.06]  yeah,
[4899.06 --> 4900.26]  the executive team sent me here.
[4900.28 --> 4901.72]  I just work here.
[4902.94 --> 4903.66]  Cause I really,
[4903.76 --> 4904.48]  I honestly don't,
[4904.66 --> 4905.18]  that is fairly true.
[4905.28 --> 4906.42]  I don't really have an opinion.
[4906.58 --> 4906.86]  I've,
[4906.90 --> 4907.88]  I've seen clips.
[4907.88 --> 4908.34]  Like I said,
[4908.36 --> 4908.54]  I've,
[4908.60 --> 4909.78]  I've come across the odd clip.
[4909.84 --> 4911.84]  I've never actually like sat through an entire podcast,
[4911.84 --> 4912.34]  but I've,
[4912.34 --> 4915.42]  I've seen clips here and there that make it look like a very,
[4915.48 --> 4916.26]  very stupid thing.
[4916.26 --> 4916.98]  Um,
[4917.10 --> 4924.02]  but I've also seen clips that seem to have intelligent people and some semblance of like a,
[4924.02 --> 4925.36]  a coherent,
[4925.36 --> 4926.40]  uh,
[4926.44 --> 4927.52]  intellectual conversation.
[4927.52 --> 4928.88]  So I don't really know what to make of it.
[4929.04 --> 4929.38]  Yeah.
[4929.38 --> 4930.68]  Uh,
[4930.68 --> 4931.06]  I don't know.
[4931.16 --> 4932.32]  I just think things like that,
[4932.38 --> 4932.86]  like,
[4932.86 --> 4936.00]  yeah,
[4936.00 --> 4937.10]  if you keep your head about you,
[4937.16 --> 4937.74]  like whatever,
[4937.98 --> 4938.40]  I don't know.
[4938.48 --> 4939.10]  It's just talking,
[4939.16 --> 4942.28]  man.
[4942.28 --> 4945.06]  We discover Linus pays people to play games for him.
[4945.84 --> 4946.32]  Um,
[4946.40 --> 4947.02]  that could be,
[4947.18 --> 4948.22]  that could be something.
[4948.38 --> 4948.56]  Nah,
[4948.66 --> 4949.18]  there's to play.
[4949.34 --> 4950.72]  You guys got nothing.
[4951.08 --> 4952.60]  You guys got nothing.
[4953.58 --> 4955.08]  Badminton center is a drug front.
[4955.32 --> 4955.62]  Oh,
[4955.68 --> 4956.38]  that's not bad.
[4956.44 --> 4957.44]  That's pretty good.
[4957.66 --> 4957.92]  Yeah.
[4958.02 --> 4958.28]  There's,
[4958.38 --> 4958.72]  there's,
[4958.84 --> 4960.22]  there's shipping bays on the back.
[4960.62 --> 4963.14]  Shuttlecocks more like mule penises.
[4964.70 --> 4965.62]  Like mules,
[4965.78 --> 4966.74]  like for drugs.
[4967.08 --> 4967.34]  Yeah.
[4967.46 --> 4967.88]  I don't know.
[4967.98 --> 4968.30]  Okay.
[4969.40 --> 4969.80]  All right.
[4970.20 --> 4970.48]  Yeah.
[4970.58 --> 4971.22]  And they're big.
[4971.60 --> 4972.04]  So,
[4972.04 --> 4972.86]  lots of drugs,
[4972.98 --> 4974.80]  big mule penises drugs.
[4975.32 --> 4976.22]  I don't know.
[4977.00 --> 4978.28]  Like aphrodisiac.
[4978.30 --> 4979.08]  I don't know the lingo.
[4979.24 --> 4979.48]  Okay.
[4979.84 --> 4980.90]  I think it's Panda.
[4984.12 --> 4984.60]  Um,
[4985.88 --> 4986.68]  oh man,
[4987.74 --> 4988.80]  what else we got here?
[4988.92 --> 4989.30]  Shuttlecocks.
[4989.36 --> 4990.84]  You could have a cock fighting ring.
[4991.64 --> 4992.12]  Oh man.
[4992.12 --> 4993.28]  Even in the float plane,
[4993.38 --> 5000.14]  it's amazing how many people like actually believe some of the stuff that is just like not true at all.
[5000.14 --> 5001.00]  Uh,
[5001.00 --> 5003.20]  someone said someone committed suicide because of you.
[5003.26 --> 5004.50]  That's not true at all.
[5004.60 --> 5005.08]  That is true.
[5005.08 --> 5007.24]  That is absolutely false.
[5007.30 --> 5008.96]  I have personally verified,
[5009.18 --> 5010.58]  but that is absolutely false.
[5010.76 --> 5010.88]  Yeah.
[5010.88 --> 5011.76]  And it's just,
[5011.88 --> 5012.78]  it's,
[5012.78 --> 5012.80]  it's,
[5012.80 --> 5017.82]  it's so bizarre the way that someone can say something about you online.
[5017.82 --> 5018.90]  And it becomes,
[5018.90 --> 5024.48]  and it becomes canon in some people's heads and you can never reach a hundred percent of them.
[5024.66 --> 5027.88]  You can never reach a hundred percent of them again.
[5028.16 --> 5030.36]  Luke is actually allergic to chicken and rice.
[5031.10 --> 5031.42]  Oh,
[5031.42 --> 5034.24]  that would throw off my whole worldview.
[5039.30 --> 5040.32]  What does it mean?
[5041.42 --> 5045.78]  Maybe his allergy is that it engorges certain parts of his body.
[5046.12 --> 5047.12]  Oh no.
[5047.12 --> 5048.92]  Which would actually work out great.
[5050.14 --> 5052.30]  Given what he cooks his famous chicken for.
[5053.42 --> 5056.04]  For his 100% success chicken rate.
[5056.90 --> 5057.66]  That could be,
[5057.76 --> 5058.96]  that could be quite convenient.
[5059.28 --> 5059.56]  Winner,
[5059.60 --> 5059.76]  winner,
[5059.88 --> 5060.36]  chicken dinner,

[5207.96 --> 5210.24]  It's like trying to read the manual for the manual.
[5210.60 --> 5213.12]  But our sponsor, Boot.dev, cracked the code.
[5213.36 --> 5216.34]  Boot.dev is a fully online, self-paced, gamified way
[5216.34 --> 5217.92]  to get into the world of coding.
[5218.26 --> 5219.66]  You'll get your hands on the keyboard
[5219.66 --> 5221.50]  and write a ton of code by completing quests,
[5221.60 --> 5223.36]  and eventually you can challenge the boss.
[5223.78 --> 5225.76]  You can learn backend web development from start to finish
[5225.76 --> 5227.60]  using Python and Go programming languages,
[5228.00 --> 5229.90]  and it's not just here for fun and games.
[5229.90 --> 5232.88]  Boot.dev even teaches you how to land a programming job
[5232.88 --> 5233.54]  when you're ready.
[5234.02 --> 5235.00]  According to Stack Overflow,
[5235.08 --> 5237.26]  the median salary for backend developers in the U.S.
[5237.26 --> 5239.50]  in 2023 was over $100,000.
[5240.44 --> 5241.36]  The best part?
[5241.74 --> 5243.10]  Boot.dev offers a 30-day,
[5243.22 --> 5244.78]  no questions asked refund policy
[5244.78 --> 5246.36]  and a free demo of every course.
[5246.60 --> 5248.40]  So check out Boot.dev at the link in the description
[5248.40 --> 5250.66]  and get 25% off your first payment
[5250.66 --> 5252.16]  using our code WAN.
[5252.40 --> 5254.38]  That's 25% off your first month
[5254.38 --> 5255.60]  or your first year,
[5255.84 --> 5257.78]  depending on which subscription you choose.
[5257.78 --> 5259.34]  All right.
[5260.06 --> 5261.34]  What are we supposed to be doing, Dan?
[5261.68 --> 5263.44]  I think we'll do some more topics.
[5264.86 --> 5265.34]  Sure.
[5266.62 --> 5267.66]  I like this one.
[5268.14 --> 5269.96]  2024 was a year.
[5270.78 --> 5271.74]  Yes, it was.
[5272.12 --> 5273.68]  What were your favorite moments?
[5273.86 --> 5275.12]  We asked the writers,
[5275.52 --> 5278.66]  what were your favorite videos
[5278.66 --> 5279.86]  that you worked on this year?
[5279.96 --> 5281.16]  Oh, this is fun.
[5281.98 --> 5282.42]  Okay.
[5282.90 --> 5284.72]  Luke, do you mind clicking them
[5284.72 --> 5286.24]  so that I can like switch over
[5286.24 --> 5287.88]  to your laptop or something like that?
[5287.88 --> 5288.30]  Yep.
[5289.26 --> 5293.02]  First up is David with his console tier list.
[5293.60 --> 5296.68]  Perhaps the most high effort tier list video ever made,
[5296.86 --> 5297.44]  says David,
[5297.86 --> 5300.14]  the Cleopatra of the tier list format.
[5300.72 --> 5303.46]  Can you tell the guy writes for a living?
[5304.46 --> 5305.24]  David says,
[5305.40 --> 5306.94]  I loved making this video
[5306.94 --> 5308.84]  because it fell outside of our comfort zone.
[5309.02 --> 5310.54]  I especially liked the challenge
[5310.54 --> 5311.92]  of coming up with visuals
[5311.92 --> 5314.82]  for the longer storytelling bits
[5314.82 --> 5316.04]  like the paper puppet show
[5316.04 --> 5317.02]  during the Sony intro
[5317.02 --> 5319.82]  or the CRT A-roll during the Sega bit.
[5320.40 --> 5321.44]  Only video game donkey
[5321.44 --> 5323.14]  has a more popular console tier list.
[5323.40 --> 5325.16]  I am very proud of how this one turned out.
[5325.22 --> 5327.20]  Yeah, this one has been a slow burn.
[5327.66 --> 5328.48]  Out of the gate,
[5328.72 --> 5330.90]  it actually did not perform very well for us,
[5331.20 --> 5332.12]  but over time,
[5332.52 --> 5332.96]  it has,
[5333.34 --> 5334.64]  oh, it's cranking.
[5334.70 --> 5335.24]  Very clickable.
[5335.40 --> 5335.58]  Yep.
[5335.68 --> 5336.50]  It's doing great.
[5336.86 --> 5337.44]  Very evergreen.
[5337.60 --> 5339.62]  You can see that like to view ratio
[5339.62 --> 5341.12]  very solid.
[5341.84 --> 5342.64]  Very solid.
[5342.90 --> 5345.50]  The team outdid themselves on this one.
[5345.56 --> 5347.18]  It was an extremely high effort video
[5347.18 --> 5348.66]  and it's long.
[5349.06 --> 5350.76]  Like putting together a high effort edit
[5350.76 --> 5352.18]  like this for a 10 minute video,
[5352.30 --> 5353.40]  that's a lot of work.
[5353.66 --> 5355.28]  Putting it together for a 30 minute video
[5355.28 --> 5356.00]  and it never,
[5356.00 --> 5358.78]  it never slows down.
[5359.04 --> 5361.80]  Like the quality of this video
[5361.80 --> 5362.58]  is just outstanding.
[5362.70 --> 5363.46]  They did a really good job.
[5363.46 --> 5364.16]  I think it's pretty interesting
[5364.16 --> 5365.52]  that the highest replay spike
[5365.52 --> 5367.72]  is not the final tier list.
[5368.12 --> 5369.68]  I think it's because everyone just like,
[5369.68 --> 5371.60]  The final tier list is a high spike,
[5371.72 --> 5372.40]  but not the highest.
[5372.70 --> 5373.92]  I think everyone just kind of knows
[5373.92 --> 5375.34]  like it's PlayStation.
[5376.02 --> 5376.30]  Yeah.
[5376.80 --> 5379.22]  And there was some really like interesting stuff
[5379.22 --> 5379.68]  like this,
[5379.80 --> 5380.34]  this bit.
[5381.18 --> 5381.52]  Um,
[5381.52 --> 5382.58]  even though a lot of people
[5382.58 --> 5383.54]  know the,
[5383.54 --> 5384.42]  the history there,
[5384.42 --> 5385.34]  um,
[5385.34 --> 5388.76]  David did a great job
[5388.76 --> 5390.28]  of providing a really excellent
[5390.28 --> 5392.38]  and fast summary of it.
[5392.66 --> 5392.74]  Yeah,
[5392.76 --> 5393.14]  for sure.
[5394.16 --> 5394.50]  All right.
[5394.52 --> 5394.98]  Next up,
[5395.12 --> 5396.16]  we've got Adam.
[5396.72 --> 5399.00]  I built the world's biggest gaming TV.
[5399.68 --> 5401.62]  I can't believe Linus took this down
[5401.62 --> 5404.00]  to build a stupid badminton center.
[5404.90 --> 5406.98]  We were there till like 1 a.m.
[5406.98 --> 5409.06]  and it was worth every minute.
[5409.74 --> 5410.10]  Uh,
[5410.10 --> 5410.88]  you got that one up yet?
[5411.02 --> 5411.10]  Yeah.
[5412.84 --> 5415.20]  This was legitimately,
[5415.34 --> 5417.92]  an unforgettable experience.
[5424.58 --> 5424.86]  Unforgettable.
[5425.32 --> 5425.68]  Um,
[5426.08 --> 5426.74]  Dan was there.
[5427.38 --> 5428.42]  Dan wasn't even working.
[5429.88 --> 5431.46]  No one told me I would have been there.
[5431.68 --> 5431.80]  Yeah,
[5431.82 --> 5432.00]  I know.
[5432.04 --> 5432.38]  I'm sorry.
[5432.80 --> 5433.14]  Yeah.
[5433.14 --> 5434.62]  They called me like four hours late.
[5434.68 --> 5436.06]  I think I arrived at like 11 p.m.
[5436.22 --> 5436.44]  Yeah.
[5436.84 --> 5437.72]  Absolutely worth it.
[5437.78 --> 5440.98]  It's hard to even get a sense of the scale of it.
[5441.72 --> 5442.42]  Like it's,
[5442.42 --> 5443.72]  it's enormous.
[5444.12 --> 5444.52]  It's bonkers.
[5444.84 --> 5445.24]  Um,
[5445.98 --> 5446.88]  so cool though.
[5446.92 --> 5448.06]  And like watch,
[5448.14 --> 5450.68]  even just watching Dan play flight sim on it.
[5451.52 --> 5452.60]  You played flight.
[5452.84 --> 5453.16]  Yeah.
[5453.22 --> 5453.38]  I mean,
[5453.40 --> 5454.92]  I said at the time,
[5454.98 --> 5455.52]  I,
[5455.66 --> 5458.12]  it felt more immersive to me than VR.
[5459.24 --> 5461.06]  Just because of like,
[5461.48 --> 5461.60]  Oh,
[5461.68 --> 5462.56]  unlimited FOV.
[5462.74 --> 5463.08]  Yeah.
[5464.18 --> 5464.66]  Look,
[5464.72 --> 5465.10]  there I am.
[5465.86 --> 5466.42]  Oh yeah.
[5466.42 --> 5467.10]  You were driving the car.
[5467.16 --> 5469.62]  The car was bigger than a real car.
[5469.62 --> 5471.78]  Like you can see the couch.
[5472.26 --> 5472.74]  Yeah.
[5473.16 --> 5473.60]  Whoa.
[5474.28 --> 5474.48]  Yeah.
[5474.54 --> 5474.94]  Wow.
[5476.30 --> 5476.78]  Like,
[5476.92 --> 5477.28]  dude.
[5478.62 --> 5479.76]  So cool.
[5480.04 --> 5480.92]  That's nuts.
[5481.76 --> 5482.54]  Those walls are.
[5482.92 --> 5483.36]  Wow.
[5483.36 --> 5486.00]  35 feet tall.
[5486.00 --> 5486.30]  I think.
[5486.90 --> 5487.50]  32,
[5487.70 --> 5487.98]  32.
[5488.36 --> 5488.56]  Yeah.
[5488.84 --> 5489.08]  Yeah.
[5489.52 --> 5495.52]  And like the fact that we lucked out and it was actually slightly over 2000 inches.
[5496.02 --> 5496.58]  Dance.
[5496.58 --> 5499.70]  So we got to meme on Frank's 2000 inch TV.
[5500.96 --> 5501.36]  Yeah.
[5501.70 --> 5501.94]  Yeah.
[5502.02 --> 5502.06]  Like,
[5502.08 --> 5502.42]  Oh,
[5502.80 --> 5502.96]  Oh,
[5502.96 --> 5503.44]  I loved it,
[5503.62 --> 5503.82]  man.
[5503.84 --> 5504.22]  This is,
[5504.34 --> 5510.34]  this is amazing because I didn't even remember either of those.
[5511.28 --> 5511.72]  Yeah.
[5512.50 --> 5515.44]  Our writing team and our editors work on a lot of videos.
[5515.62 --> 5515.84]  Yeah.
[5516.10 --> 5516.40]  I,
[5516.58 --> 5517.56]  I work on,
[5517.68 --> 5517.80]  okay.
[5517.80 --> 5518.52]  How many writers we got?
[5518.62 --> 5518.78]  One,
[5518.92 --> 5519.10]  two,
[5519.26 --> 5519.46]  three,
[5519.62 --> 5520.10]  four,
[5520.62 --> 5521.24]  five,
[5521.42 --> 5521.88]  six.
[5522.44 --> 5524.60]  I'm going to also count myself seven.
[5524.70 --> 5526.14]  Cause I do write videos from time to time.
[5526.14 --> 5530.44]  So I literally work on six to seven times as many videos as them.
[5530.52 --> 5531.66]  So there are things that I just.
[5532.18 --> 5534.06]  And all the streams blank on.
[5534.50 --> 5534.88]  Um,
[5535.12 --> 5535.40]  I,
[5535.48 --> 5537.34]  I didn't remember that either of those were this year.
[5537.90 --> 5538.34]  We,
[5538.52 --> 5539.72]  we do this year.
[5539.82 --> 5539.96]  Yeah.
[5539.96 --> 5541.74]  It feels like they were longer ago.
[5541.82 --> 5542.02]  Dude,
[5542.04 --> 5543.20]  we do cool stuff.
[5543.28 --> 5543.62]  Oh yeah.
[5543.82 --> 5545.80]  We like actually very awesome stuff.
[5545.88 --> 5546.00]  Yeah.
[5546.04 --> 5546.62]  Crying out loud.
[5546.84 --> 5547.00]  Yeah.
[5547.22 --> 5547.50]  Um,
[5547.54 --> 5549.50]  ploof says his favorite.
[5549.66 --> 5550.42]  No way.
[5550.84 --> 5553.52]  No way is working on it.
[5553.62 --> 5554.36]  This one.
[5554.44 --> 5554.76]  Got it.
[5556.14 --> 5556.50]  Oh,
[5557.12 --> 5557.52]  wrong one.
[5558.08 --> 5561.80]  I have two weeks to file a dispute for this scam TV.
[5562.28 --> 5562.72]  Okay.
[5562.94 --> 5569.70]  It is the hardest that I think I have ever seen ploof laugh in the years that we have been working together.
[5569.86 --> 5571.12]  So you got to skip forward.
[5571.20 --> 5573.58]  It's probably going to be a view spike forward,
[5573.68 --> 5573.88]  forward,
[5574.00 --> 5574.40]  way forward.
[5574.54 --> 5575.64]  Look for the big one at the end.
[5576.06 --> 5577.20]  This is probably it.
[5577.28 --> 5578.10]  That's got to be it.
[5579.38 --> 5582.94]  So there's a point here where he realizes.
[5582.94 --> 5586.58]  Wait for it.
[5586.58 --> 5587.76]  That's inside the glass,
[5587.84 --> 5588.24]  by the way.
[5589.02 --> 5589.12]  Yeah.
[5589.20 --> 5589.34]  Oh,
[5589.44 --> 5590.32]  he realizes.
[5593.28 --> 5601.94]  That the only person he knows who's stupid enough to get ripped off by this thing is sitting right next to him.
[5601.94 --> 5608.72]  Have you ever seen a man so happy?
[5613.22 --> 5613.90]  Oh,
[5614.00 --> 5614.18]  man.
[5614.24 --> 5614.40]  Oh,
[5614.46 --> 5614.66]  dude.
[5614.66 --> 5619.50]  No acting could ever be that pure and that genuine.
[5620.82 --> 5621.98]  The mirth.
[5622.12 --> 5622.36]  Oh,
[5622.52 --> 5622.56]  man.
[5622.56 --> 5624.14]  The mirth that this man felt.
[5624.70 --> 5625.74]  So he says,
[5625.82 --> 5627.08]  he says,
[5627.08 --> 5628.52]  just like Jake Tyvee.
[5628.64 --> 5630.76]  I enjoy wasting Linus's money.
[5631.04 --> 5631.52]  Also,
[5631.66 --> 5633.88]  apparently once the refund was finally going to happen,
[5634.00 --> 5634.82]  support ghosted us.
[5634.88 --> 5636.36]  Did we not get a refund?
[5639.00 --> 5639.48]  Oh,
[5639.62 --> 5639.84]  boy.
[5640.20 --> 5640.60]  Oh,
[5640.60 --> 5643.06]  you know,
[5643.22 --> 5649.96]  we've had to dial back the like references to like wasting my money and stuff in videos because people get so hung up on it.
[5650.20 --> 5650.84]  They're like,
[5650.92 --> 5651.06]  oh,
[5651.14 --> 5652.66]  Linus flexing his money again.
[5652.66 --> 5653.12]  Or like,
[5653.22 --> 5654.40]  it's not even his money.
[5654.48 --> 5655.32]  It's the company's money.
[5655.32 --> 5655.88]  It's like,
[5656.20 --> 5657.40]  like people get so mad about it.
[5657.60 --> 5659.80]  What they don't understand is I don't write.
[5659.92 --> 5661.42]  I don't write that into the videos.
[5662.02 --> 5664.00]  The team writes that into the videos.
[5664.82 --> 5666.22]  They think it's funny.
[5666.98 --> 5667.36]  Like,
[5667.54 --> 5669.12]  what do you want?
[5669.16 --> 5670.92]  And so I have to sit there and tell them,
[5671.42 --> 5671.56]  yeah,
[5671.58 --> 5678.10]  this thing that you enjoy and you think is like genuinely funny to meme on because people will get upset on behalf of the team.
[5678.16 --> 5678.56]  They'll be like,
[5678.60 --> 5678.70]  yeah,
[5678.70 --> 5683.24]  Linus flexing his money in front of his team that can't afford this Chinese TV or whatever.
[5683.24 --> 5684.98]  But they're the ones who love it.
[5685.32 --> 5688.12]  That's pretty funny.
[5688.12 --> 5688.28]  Oh, man.
[5688.86 --> 5689.26]  Um,
[5690.70 --> 5691.50]  all right.
[5691.54 --> 5692.20]  What else we got?
[5692.26 --> 5692.62]  Oh,
[5692.74 --> 5693.06]  yeah.
[5693.28 --> 5693.50]  Oh,
[5693.58 --> 5693.82]  yeah.
[5693.92 --> 5696.64]  Alex obviously was going to pick this one.
[5697.18 --> 5699.34]  The Mighty Car Mods collab.
[5700.52 --> 5700.96]  Coincidentally,
[5701.38 --> 5703.12]  Plouffe's least favorite video.
[5703.84 --> 5704.34]  Plouffe says,
[5704.42 --> 5705.36]  not my least favorite,
[5705.50 --> 5707.60]  but I do wish y'all had like one extra day.
[5707.82 --> 5708.10]  Thanks,
[5708.22 --> 5708.64]  Customs,
[5708.64 --> 5709.80]  for delaying the engine.
[5709.80 --> 5713.80]  because it took a while for them to actually get it driving ready for it.
[5713.92 --> 5714.14]  Oh,
[5714.24 --> 5714.44]  okay.
[5714.76 --> 5714.96]  Yeah.
[5715.06 --> 5718.14]  It was sitting in 105 for like the next couple of weeks.
[5718.34 --> 5718.52]  Oh,
[5718.58 --> 5718.78]  wow.
[5719.12 --> 5720.74]  This is such a great moment for the engine.
[5720.74 --> 5721.58]  That was pretty cool.
[5721.66 --> 5722.32]  It's so awesome.
[5722.32 --> 5723.68]  Having them all in the engine bay there.
[5723.72 --> 5724.10]  I love it.
[5724.86 --> 5725.24]  Um,
[5725.52 --> 5725.86]  anyway.
[5725.86 --> 5727.62]  I have a response from Plouffe here about the TV.
[5728.00 --> 5728.30]  Oh,
[5728.52 --> 5728.78]  oh,
[5728.88 --> 5729.38]  what do you say?
[5730.44 --> 5731.22]  Let's see.
[5731.42 --> 5732.02]  Let's see.
[5732.02 --> 5732.20]  Wow.
[5732.28 --> 5735.40]  Plouffe with the game sense to message the producer rather than messaging me.
[5735.48 --> 5737.22]  I think that's a first for when show.
[5737.34 --> 5737.48]  No,
[5737.56 --> 5738.36]  I messaged Plouffe.
[5738.42 --> 5738.60]  Oh,
[5739.24 --> 5739.72]  all right then.
[5739.84 --> 5741.70]  That's my W.
[5742.70 --> 5743.06]  Nice.
[5743.24 --> 5744.44]  Or we can both take the L's.
[5744.52 --> 5744.78]  I don't know.
[5744.84 --> 5745.22]  We'll share.
[5745.40 --> 5746.18]  I like sharing L's.
[5746.28 --> 5746.78]  Two L's.
[5746.94 --> 5747.18]  Yeah.
[5747.62 --> 5748.30]  They make a W.
[5748.38 --> 5749.12]  They make a W.
[5750.48 --> 5750.88]  Uh,
[5750.92 --> 5751.42]  let's see.
[5751.78 --> 5753.40]  AliExpress is offering a partial refund,
[5753.52 --> 5754.60]  but not telling me the amount.
[5755.64 --> 5756.42]  I said,
[5756.42 --> 5758.52]  I either want to return it or get a full refund.
[5759.52 --> 5759.88]  Uh,
[5760.48 --> 5761.98]  they closed the case.
[5763.40 --> 5763.84]  Oh,
[5764.16 --> 5764.98]  uh,
[5764.98 --> 5765.46]  okay.
[5765.56 --> 5766.58]  Case closed then,
[5766.68 --> 5767.32]  I guess.
[5767.92 --> 5768.24]  Yeah.
[5768.34 --> 5768.78]  Let's see.
[5768.84 --> 5769.20]  Visa,
[5769.52 --> 5769.86]  uh,
[5769.86 --> 5770.18]  Visa.
[5770.32 --> 5771.26]  They reached out to Visa.
[5772.26 --> 5772.78]  Uh,
[5773.34 --> 5778.66]  basically both TVs are lumped in the same purchase and AliExpress,
[5779.02 --> 5780.22]  uh,
[5780.22 --> 5781.46]  they've appealed five times.
[5782.24 --> 5784.16]  So they've appealed the chargeback.
[5784.48 --> 5785.32]  You have,
[5785.38 --> 5785.76]  uh,
[5786.44 --> 5788.02]  you've purchased two TVs.
[5788.60 --> 5789.20]  No way.
[5789.28 --> 5790.64]  I should be able to get my money back.
[5790.70 --> 5794.74]  What's the point of chargeback if I can order the wrong thing and they just get to be like,
[5794.74 --> 5794.90]  yeah,
[5794.90 --> 5795.76]  it's a Chinese inch.
[5796.90 --> 5798.12]  What's a Chinese inch?
[5798.70 --> 5798.90]  Wait,
[5798.92 --> 5799.54]  did they say that?
[5799.66 --> 5800.02]  Yeah.
[5800.58 --> 5800.94]  What?
[5801.24 --> 5801.64]  They said,
[5801.70 --> 5801.82]  yeah,
[5801.82 --> 5803.48]  our inches are different from your inches.
[5803.92 --> 5804.28]  Oh,
[5804.40 --> 5804.70]  no,
[5804.78 --> 5806.20]  I think the Visa is a separate thing.
[5806.34 --> 5806.54]  Oh,
[5806.60 --> 5806.80]  okay.
[5806.86 --> 5807.08]  Okay.
[5807.12 --> 5807.36]  Okay.
[5807.68 --> 5807.96]  All right.
[5807.98 --> 5808.10]  Well,
[5808.10 --> 5808.76]  we'll figure it out.
[5808.82 --> 5809.52]  We'll figure it out.
[5809.74 --> 5809.96]  If it,
[5809.96 --> 5810.74]  if it says,
[5810.80 --> 5811.58]  if it makes you feel better,
[5811.58 --> 5813.34]  the video did get three to five million views.
[5814.60 --> 5816.10]  What's three to five million?
[5816.30 --> 5818.14]  Plouffe does have access to this dashboard.
[5818.42 --> 5819.32]  Did he say that?
[5819.32 --> 5819.68]  Or are you,
[5819.74 --> 5820.50]  are you saying that?
[5820.58 --> 5820.96]  That's what,
[5821.06 --> 5821.34]  that's what you said.
[5821.34 --> 5821.90]  Oh my God.
[5821.92 --> 5822.54]  This is real.
[5823.28 --> 5823.68]  What's up?
[5826.98 --> 5827.38]  Okay.
[5827.48 --> 5828.12]  So yes,
[5828.28 --> 5829.10]  that's true,
[5829.24 --> 5831.84]  but the TV then should be bigger,
[5831.92 --> 5832.44]  not smaller.
[5833.30 --> 5833.70]  Oh,
[5833.76 --> 5833.98]  right.
[5834.10 --> 5834.30]  Yeah.
[5834.90 --> 5835.76]  So we,
[5835.76 --> 5837.86]  we measured it every possible way.
[5838.06 --> 5840.26]  And also there's multiple Chinese inches.
[5840.26 --> 5841.58]  Um,
[5841.58 --> 5843.06]  and Andy talked us through it.
[5843.20 --> 5843.60]  So,
[5843.82 --> 5844.34]  so we,
[5844.44 --> 5844.90]  yeah,
[5844.96 --> 5845.38]  so we,
[5845.38 --> 5845.68]  we,
[5845.78 --> 5846.64]  we measured it.
[5846.70 --> 5847.72]  If it was centimeters,
[5848.02 --> 5848.88]  it's not right.
[5849.20 --> 5850.76]  If it was Chinese inches,
[5850.76 --> 5851.70]  it's not right.
[5851.76 --> 5853.10]  And if it was regular inches,
[5853.10 --> 5853.94]  it's not right.
[5854.16 --> 5857.12]  It's just completely invented.
[5857.28 --> 5857.92]  Like it's,
[5857.96 --> 5860.56]  it's nothing to do with anything on any measuring tape.
[5865.56 --> 5866.00]  Anyway.
[5866.82 --> 5867.26]  Okay.
[5867.62 --> 5867.92]  Okay.
[5870.26 --> 5871.64]  All right.
[5871.66 --> 5872.28]  Let's keep going.
[5872.78 --> 5873.22]  Elijah.
[5874.14 --> 5874.58]  Really?
[5876.06 --> 5876.46]  Huh?
[5878.34 --> 5878.66]  Uh,
[5878.74 --> 5879.02]  add.
[5880.38 --> 5880.82]  Yeah.
[5880.86 --> 5882.44]  If only there was some way to,
[5882.86 --> 5885.00]  because you know that we're going to do the next thing,
[5885.12 --> 5885.70]  cue up the,
[5885.78 --> 5885.90]  okay.
[5885.92 --> 5886.32]  It doesn't matter.
[5886.64 --> 5886.84]  Uh,
[5886.84 --> 5889.40]  the point is his favorite was,
[5889.46 --> 5891.20]  why did you make me build this?
[5891.72 --> 5893.66]  The CEO PC build.
[5893.76 --> 5895.36]  This was his second time water cooling.
[5895.44 --> 5897.02]  He was apparently super nervous.
[5897.76 --> 5898.18]  PS.
[5898.18 --> 5900.38]  When are we selling the poster?
[5900.76 --> 5902.70]  The video hit a hundred thousand likes.
[5903.98 --> 5904.50]  Uh,
[5904.58 --> 5904.84]  okay.
[5904.86 --> 5906.32]  So there's a poster at the end.
[5906.50 --> 5907.82]  If you go to Taryn's office.
[5909.68 --> 5910.12]  Yeah.
[5910.18 --> 5911.32]  Just anywhere in his office.
[5911.74 --> 5912.88]  So that poster,
[5913.10 --> 5914.12]  um,
[5914.96 --> 5916.00]  I think,
[5916.42 --> 5918.34]  I think we are going forward with it.
[5918.40 --> 5919.94]  I don't think it's going to be that big,
[5919.94 --> 5921.80]  but yeah,
[5921.92 --> 5922.16]  uh,
[5922.16 --> 5922.92]  you guys did,
[5922.92 --> 5925.08]  you did reach a hundred thousand likes.
[5925.08 --> 5928.26]  So there's no real avoiding that at this point.
[5929.34 --> 5929.78]  Poop.
[5931.12 --> 5932.66]  He was able to get rid of the chair,
[5932.76 --> 5933.26]  which is great.
[5933.36 --> 5934.44]  He still has to use,
[5934.64 --> 5936.92]  I think he still has the keyboard.
[5937.20 --> 5938.04]  He still has the computer.
[5938.44 --> 5939.42]  And the computer,
[5939.52 --> 5941.60]  which is loud and annoying.
[5941.90 --> 5942.68]  That's not my problem.
[5943.50 --> 5944.38]  So that sounds like,
[5944.44 --> 5945.32]  that sounds like a,
[5945.32 --> 5946.48]  like a CEO issue.
[5946.58 --> 5947.78]  If it reduces the performance.
[5948.36 --> 5949.14]  Poster soon,
[5949.34 --> 5950.34]  probably in January.
[5950.58 --> 5950.98]  Really?
[5951.50 --> 5952.36]  This is from Nick.
[5952.42 --> 5952.54]  Like,
[5952.66 --> 5952.78]  yeah,
[5952.84 --> 5953.36]  I forgot.
[5953.72 --> 5955.24]  Like it's during the work day today.
[5955.52 --> 5957.16]  There will be an option to buy the big one.
[5957.26 --> 5957.38]  Yeah.
[5957.40 --> 5958.34]  That's why I reached out.
[5958.94 --> 5959.58]  No way.
[5959.72 --> 5960.70]  Oh my gosh.
[5961.96 --> 5962.36]  Okay.
[5962.54 --> 5962.92]  Um,
[5963.04 --> 5964.12]  I responded to this.
[5964.16 --> 5966.40]  I didn't realize that it was a segment for WAN show.
[5966.58 --> 5967.22]  I said,
[5967.28 --> 5968.64]  I love all my videos equally.
[5968.82 --> 5970.86]  That's like asking me to pick my favorite child.
[5970.98 --> 5973.56]  He actually put a screenshot of that from teams in there.
[5974.08 --> 5974.44]  Um,
[5974.44 --> 5975.80]  uh,
[5975.80 --> 5978.26]  but I really enjoyed the 3d home theater video,
[5978.26 --> 5979.64]  even if no one else cared about it.
[5979.64 --> 5981.48]  It was pretty cool to,
[5981.62 --> 5985.00]  to put together like a true cinema grade passive 3d setup.
[5985.14 --> 5992.72]  The number of people that provided advice to me on how I could have done it better or cheaper by using active shutter glasses or whatever.
[5992.82 --> 5993.10]  It's like,
[5993.20 --> 5993.38]  bro,
[5993.38 --> 5997.46]  I followed 3d pretty closely.
[5997.46 --> 6001.00]  I am aware of shutter glasses.
[6003.84 --> 6008.66]  I did it this way because I wanted passive 3d with glass optics.
[6008.66 --> 6014.22]  I have never seen anything as good as the 3d setup that was in my house.
[6014.36 --> 6016.16]  It was awesome.
[6016.36 --> 6024.20]  The only thing that I would like to do differently is I would like to get my hands on a higher quality DLP projector.
[6024.20 --> 6025.12]  I also,
[6025.12 --> 6031.38]  I also learned about another type of filter that could help me make non DLP projectors,
[6031.56 --> 6031.70]  like,
[6031.76 --> 6034.80]  like make the light polarizable or something as a whole.
[6035.30 --> 6036.26]  I forget what it's called.
[6036.34 --> 6036.52]  Anyway,
[6036.62 --> 6036.76]  I,
[6036.76 --> 6039.34]  I linked Elijah to some articles in case we were going to do a follow-up,
[6039.40 --> 6040.38]  but the video didn't get any views.
[6040.42 --> 6041.12]  So we probably won't,
[6041.74 --> 6041.94]  but,
[6042.02 --> 6042.36]  um,
[6042.44 --> 6047.70]  but I'd like to get my hands on some better DLP projectors with lens shift so that I could perfectly align the images.
[6047.70 --> 6048.60]  And then,
[6048.80 --> 6049.36]  Oh man.
[6049.94 --> 6050.22]  Oh,
[6050.38 --> 6051.04]  so cool.
[6051.28 --> 6051.60]  I,
[6051.66 --> 6051.84]  I,
[6051.96 --> 6052.42]  I,
[6052.42 --> 6055.32]  I would totally have that set up maybe as part of a,
[6055.32 --> 6056.28]  like whale land or something.
[6056.46 --> 6059.22]  I also really enjoyed doing the Equinix tour.
[6059.34 --> 6061.28]  I always love getting access to places.
[6061.40 --> 6062.38]  Other people don't get to go.
[6063.00 --> 6063.38]  Um,
[6063.38 --> 6065.52]  it's one of my favorite perks of this job.
[6065.52 --> 6066.22]  Like it,
[6066.40 --> 6066.56]  Oh,
[6066.66 --> 6067.22]  so cool.
[6067.40 --> 6071.60]  And then the last one that came off the top of my head was the motherboard repair video.
[6072.06 --> 6077.68]  That was probably the most pure joy and like exhilaration that I have felt.
[6077.70 --> 6079.56]  filming a video in at least a couple of years,
[6079.56 --> 6083.54]  just like stacking up those W's.
[6083.56 --> 6085.10]  Although we have one coming.
[6085.38 --> 6085.64]  Oh no,
[6085.70 --> 6086.78]  this one came out already.
[6086.78 --> 6087.78]  The one where the,
[6087.82 --> 6088.04]  uh,
[6088.04 --> 6089.92]  the wife threw the guy's PC out of,
[6089.94 --> 6090.50]  out the window.
[6090.64 --> 6090.88]  Yeah.
[6091.06 --> 6093.34]  The three story balcony when he asked for a divorce.
[6093.50 --> 6093.94]  Uh,
[6093.94 --> 6094.30]  we got,
[6094.94 --> 6095.64]  have you watched it?
[6096.10 --> 6097.48]  I've gone through parts of it.
[6097.60 --> 6097.80]  Oh,
[6097.80 --> 6098.04]  okay.
[6098.58 --> 6099.02]  Um,
[6099.42 --> 6101.82]  we got all but one component working.
[6102.44 --> 6102.84]  Yes.
[6102.90 --> 6103.50]  I didn't know that.
[6103.60 --> 6104.36]  All but one.
[6104.68 --> 6104.88]  Wait,
[6104.90 --> 6105.00]  no,
[6105.00 --> 6106.04]  I think I did watch the whole thing.
[6106.16 --> 6106.40]  Yeah.
[6106.40 --> 6108.34]  That was super awesome.
[6108.50 --> 6109.36]  I was very surprised.
[6109.62 --> 6111.50]  I've also got another response here from Nick light.
[6112.06 --> 6113.00]  I'm on vacation.
[6113.64 --> 6114.66]  You Linus.
[6114.74 --> 6115.40]  I'm not working.
[6117.56 --> 6118.72]  I'm on vacation.
[6119.06 --> 6119.72]  You Linus.
[6119.92 --> 6120.80]  There's a blank in there.
[6120.98 --> 6121.10]  No,
[6121.14 --> 6122.66]  he said you Linus.
[6122.74 --> 6123.28]  I'm not working.
[6123.84 --> 6124.56]  You Linus.
[6125.16 --> 6125.58]  What's you?
[6125.58 --> 6126.72]  Like you Linus.
[6127.24 --> 6128.52]  You Linus.
[6128.60 --> 6129.00]  Oh,
[6130.30 --> 6131.40]  you Linus.
[6132.08 --> 6132.40]  Nice.
[6132.82 --> 6133.04]  God,
[6133.08 --> 6133.90]  I hope my button works.
[6133.90 --> 6136.24]  doesn't for us.
[6137.90 --> 6138.38]  Um,
[6138.66 --> 6139.90]  Jordan said,
[6140.14 --> 6140.98]  I'm on vacation,
[6141.16 --> 6141.36]  Adam.
[6141.54 --> 6142.90]  Please stop messaging me.
[6144.42 --> 6144.90]  Nice.
[6145.10 --> 6146.78]  And then Bell's favorite was,
[6146.84 --> 6148.12]  you might feel a little pressure.
[6148.56 --> 6151.10]  The Ludwig swipe plus bidet short circuit.
[6151.24 --> 6153.04]  That was actually a lot of fun.
[6153.24 --> 6153.38]  What?
[6153.56 --> 6153.76]  Oh,
[6153.90 --> 6154.18]  sorry.
[6154.44 --> 6154.66]  Sorry.
[6154.70 --> 6156.52]  I just assumed you wouldn't bother clicking it.
[6156.60 --> 6156.84]  Wow.
[6156.84 --> 6156.90]  Wow.
[6156.90 --> 6160.60]  That was the only one that's had an ad.
[6160.70 --> 6161.90]  Like this one didn't have an ad on it.
[6161.94 --> 6162.52]  That was awesome.
[6162.62 --> 6163.60]  How many views did this get?
[6164.54 --> 6165.68]  We should hire this guy.
[6166.24 --> 6167.76]  850,000 views on a bidet.
[6168.28 --> 6168.68]  Yeah.
[6169.14 --> 6170.58]  Absolutely natural talent.
[6170.86 --> 6171.12]  I mean,
[6171.14 --> 6172.58]  I told him this when he came up here.
[6172.72 --> 6173.46]  I was like,
[6174.10 --> 6175.46]  if there's anything,
[6175.54 --> 6175.96]  I think I,
[6176.00 --> 6177.34]  I think I actually said this on the yard,
[6177.46 --> 6180.16]  but the guy is an S tier personality.
[6180.42 --> 6180.64]  Yeah.
[6180.64 --> 6181.38]  Like just,
[6181.84 --> 6188.10]  you could probably put him in front of anything with anyone doing anything.
[6188.26 --> 6188.90]  They do pretty well.
[6188.98 --> 6189.90]  And he would just,
[6190.90 --> 6194.50]  he'd like figure out the vibe,
[6195.20 --> 6197.98]  settle in and just perform.
[6198.14 --> 6198.92]  Like the guy is,
[6199.28 --> 6199.62]  yeah,
[6199.74 --> 6201.16]  just absolutely S tier.
[6201.32 --> 6201.88]  Get at what he does.
[6206.08 --> 6206.56]  Okay.
[6206.68 --> 6206.84]  Oh,
[6206.90 --> 6207.18]  Sammy,
[6207.96 --> 6209.32]  Sammy picked a favorite one.
[6209.32 --> 6212.40]  I haven't watched this video.
[6212.86 --> 6218.48]  You haven't watched your own setup doctor.
[6218.68 --> 6219.22]  That's weird.
[6220.02 --> 6221.16]  No way.
[6221.30 --> 6222.10]  I feel like I would watch mine.
[6222.32 --> 6222.48]  Yeah.
[6222.48 --> 6224.50]  He says he has a hard time watching himself.
[6224.84 --> 6225.02]  Oh,
[6225.48 --> 6226.12]  I'm the same.
[6226.18 --> 6226.74]  I haven't watched mine.
[6227.32 --> 6227.72]  What?
[6229.22 --> 6229.74]  Oh,
[6229.86 --> 6230.26]  what?
[6231.54 --> 6232.02]  Okay.
[6232.58 --> 6234.20]  I was working up the courage to,
[6234.30 --> 6235.24]  but well,
[6235.36 --> 6235.84]  anyway,
[6236.02 --> 6236.78]  all right.
[6236.78 --> 6237.14]  Yeah.
[6237.18 --> 6238.78]  He said that was his joke answer.
[6238.78 --> 6240.46]  And then his real answer was,
[6240.56 --> 6241.86]  this is how we make an LTT video.
[6241.94 --> 6242.38]  2024.
[6242.74 --> 6243.82]  This was outstanding.
[6243.82 --> 6246.50]  And I didn't even know about it until I watched it.
[6247.70 --> 6254.80]  The team did such an outstanding job of this video going through the entire process in like,
[6254.90 --> 6255.20]  uh,
[6255.78 --> 6256.56]  this is super cool.
[6256.64 --> 6257.02]  I don't know.
[6257.10 --> 6262.94]  I don't know how to describe why it's so much better than the way that we've done it in the past.
[6262.94 --> 6267.62]  But I think this might be the best like dislike ratio on float plane.
[6267.76 --> 6268.70]  You just ruined it now.
[6268.90 --> 6269.04]  No,
[6269.12 --> 6269.74]  they won't.
[6269.88 --> 6270.78]  Float plane's not like that.
[6271.14 --> 6272.04]  I'm going to do it.
[6272.50 --> 6272.78]  What?
[6272.96 --> 6273.16]  Dan?
[6273.28 --> 6273.42]  No,
[6273.50 --> 6274.50]  float plane's not like that.
[6274.58 --> 6275.44]  They don't respect that.
[6275.88 --> 6276.36]  Um,
[6276.36 --> 6277.44]  yeah.
[6277.66 --> 6278.24]  So yeah,
[6278.32 --> 6278.46]  it's,
[6278.54 --> 6280.90]  he said it was a video idea he wanted to do for over a year.
[6281.40 --> 6281.48]  And,
[6281.60 --> 6281.76]  uh,
[6281.76 --> 6282.72]  don't Sammy.
[6283.58 --> 6284.02]  Outstanding.
[6284.28 --> 6284.50]  Exclusive.
[6284.50 --> 6289.62]  Are you kidding me right now?
[6293.98 --> 6294.52]  Hold on.
[6294.54 --> 6295.44]  I can block mods.
[6296.20 --> 6296.58]  You can,
[6296.66 --> 6296.80]  yeah,
[6296.90 --> 6297.14]  Dan,
[6297.14 --> 6297.64]  do it.
[6298.04 --> 6298.34]  Do it.
[6298.48 --> 6298.80]  Ban him.
[6299.16 --> 6300.50]  Ban him from float plane.
[6303.38 --> 6303.82]  Um,
[6304.48 --> 6304.86]  okay.
[6304.86 --> 6305.36]  Uh,
[6306.18 --> 6306.52]  Adam,
[6306.72 --> 6306.98]  uh,
[6306.98 --> 6307.86]  added some other stuff,
[6307.96 --> 6308.64]  some stats,
[6308.78 --> 6309.12]  uh,
[6309.24 --> 6312.74]  844 million views on the channel this year.
[6313.34 --> 6313.78]  Um,
[6313.78 --> 6316.70]  172 million hours of watch time.
[6317.12 --> 6317.54]  Uh,
[6317.64 --> 6319.42]  234 LTT videos,
[6319.56 --> 6320.46]  59 live streams,
[6320.58 --> 6321.48]  34 shorts,
[6321.94 --> 6324.76]  126 float plane exclusives,
[6324.82 --> 6327.68]  including behind the scenes and exclusive live streams and themed weeks.
[6328.36 --> 6328.84]  Um,
[6328.90 --> 6329.74]  Themed weeks are sick.
[6330.42 --> 6331.92]  640,000 new subscribers.
[6332.42 --> 6332.74]  Oh,
[6332.80 --> 6334.66]  we have some most viewed videos.
[6334.80 --> 6335.86]  Can you guess the top three?
[6335.94 --> 6336.04]  Okay.
[6336.06 --> 6336.16]  Well,
[6336.16 --> 6336.72]  I know one of them.
[6336.96 --> 6337.84]  I have a theory for one of them,
[6337.92 --> 6340.50]  which I'm very surprised wasn't mentioned at all.
[6341.02 --> 6341.22]  Oh,
[6341.26 --> 6341.46]  really?
[6341.60 --> 6342.10]  Up above.
[6342.44 --> 6342.80]  Um,
[6342.80 --> 6345.52]  I know the top one is the,
[6345.78 --> 6346.48]  Ooh,
[6346.76 --> 6347.26]  hold on.
[6347.42 --> 6348.86]  I have a theory of what one it is.
[6348.94 --> 6349.56]  Should I write it down?
[6350.54 --> 6350.94]  Um,
[6351.28 --> 6351.50]  yeah,
[6351.50 --> 6352.16]  you can write it down,
[6352.24 --> 6352.94]  but I know it's,
[6352.98 --> 6353.88]  I know it's one of two.
[6354.34 --> 6354.74]  It's,
[6354.98 --> 6355.44]  Oh shoot.
[6355.52 --> 6355.68]  Oh,
[6355.70 --> 6356.40]  it's one of three.
[6356.52 --> 6357.02]  Oh shoot.
[6357.38 --> 6361.30]  I think the top viewed video on the channel for this year is actually,
[6361.30 --> 6362.46]  um,
[6362.46 --> 6366.06]  the Samsung folding displays short from CES.
[6366.22 --> 6366.80]  That isn't what I thought.
[6366.88 --> 6367.94]  And that isn't what I wrote down.
[6368.20 --> 6368.60]  Interesting.
[6368.60 --> 6369.32]  Uh,
[6370.04 --> 6370.60]  Oh,
[6370.76 --> 6371.94]  we didn't count that apparently.
[6372.20 --> 6373.26]  So I think we,
[6373.40 --> 6374.68]  I think we might've gotten it wrong.
[6375.58 --> 6377.52]  I guess they're only counting VOD,
[6377.64 --> 6377.88]  but yeah,
[6377.92 --> 6378.04]  no,
[6378.08 --> 6379.78]  the top performing other than that,
[6379.86 --> 6380.56]  uh,
[6380.56 --> 6381.78]  would have been the underwater scooter,
[6381.94 --> 6384.80]  but that's another short or the Taiwan PC.
[6384.96 --> 6385.24]  Okay.
[6385.36 --> 6386.10]  I wrote down Taiwan.
[6386.10 --> 6386.34]  Yeah.
[6386.34 --> 6386.48]  Yeah.
[6386.48 --> 6386.54]  Yeah.
[6386.54 --> 6386.68]  That,
[6386.74 --> 6389.16]  that one far and away outperformed everything else this year.
[6389.16 --> 6389.52]  Yeah.
[6390.00 --> 6392.82]  I'm going to sort by views here.
[6392.88 --> 6393.34]  I think,
[6393.84 --> 6394.08]  Oh,
[6394.14 --> 6394.52]  I don't know.
[6394.58 --> 6395.56]  Over 10 million.
[6396.14 --> 6396.98]  Is that enough zeros?
[6396.98 --> 6397.60]  I don't even know.
[6398.68 --> 6399.08]  Uh,
[6399.12 --> 6399.48]  yeah.
[6399.98 --> 6400.26]  Yeah.
[6400.26 --> 6405.56]  So this short from January of 2024 got almost 13 million views.
[6405.78 --> 6406.06]  Whoa.
[6406.44 --> 6406.68]  Yeah.
[6407.22 --> 6407.66]  Um,
[6407.66 --> 6408.52]  this one got a lot,
[6408.60 --> 6409.74]  but it's from the previous year.
[6410.04 --> 6411.42]  And then the,
[6411.42 --> 6413.22]  the underwater scooter one,
[6413.24 --> 6415.36]  I think did like eight or 9 million or something like that.
[6415.36 --> 6416.20]  So hold on.
[6416.20 --> 6416.84]  Let's have a look at,
[6416.88 --> 6417.84]  let's have a look at what Adam's got.
[6417.92 --> 6419.02]  So can you guess the top three?
[6419.08 --> 6419.20]  Yeah.
[6419.28 --> 6422.22]  I knew that one off the top of my head as for the next one,
[6422.22 --> 6423.64]  man,
[6423.78 --> 6424.44]  I don't know.
[6424.44 --> 6429.54]  We actually played this game recently and I had no idea when we did the 16th anniversary
[6429.54 --> 6429.92]  stream.
[6429.98 --> 6432.36]  I had no idea what like top performing videos were from the channel.
[6432.46 --> 6435.32]  I don't spend nearly as much time in the dashboard now that it sucks so much.
[6437.02 --> 6437.42]  Um,
[6437.52 --> 6437.66]  yeah.
[6437.68 --> 6438.04]  So the,
[6438.12 --> 6438.22]  yeah,
[6438.22 --> 6438.84]  the other three,
[6438.96 --> 6441.12]  I knew Taiwan PC was going to smash.
[6441.24 --> 6442.08]  Other than that,
[6442.08 --> 6443.42]  um,
[6444.46 --> 6444.80]  crap.
[6444.88 --> 6445.92]  I feel like the,
[6445.92 --> 6448.74]  the iPhone video is going to be up there somewhere.
[6448.96 --> 6449.36]  No,
[6450.14 --> 6450.34]  no,
[6450.34 --> 6451.40]  it's like good.
[6452.22 --> 6453.36]  I think it's got like 3 million,
[6453.50 --> 6454.40]  2.9 million or something.
[6454.48 --> 6456.30]  The next segment is commented.
[6456.62 --> 6458.28]  I bet you it's up there for that one.
[6459.28 --> 6459.58]  Hmm.
[6463.36 --> 6464.42]  Most views though.
[6466.00 --> 6467.82]  Cause the giant TV was last year,
[6467.84 --> 6468.04]  right?
[6468.76 --> 6469.32]  Was it?
[6469.42 --> 6471.04]  I think the giant TV was last year.
[6472.74 --> 6473.10]  Oh,
[6473.14 --> 6474.00]  you don't mean like the,
[6474.00 --> 6475.82]  the projector set up at the badminton center.
[6475.96 --> 6476.04]  Yeah.
[6476.10 --> 6476.26]  No.
[6476.48 --> 6477.18]  Cause that one,
[6477.22 --> 6479.28]  I just saw that one had almost like 4 million views,
[6479.34 --> 6479.58]  I think.
[6480.04 --> 6480.40]  Okay.
[6480.40 --> 6480.94]  I give up.
[6481.38 --> 6481.86]  I don't know.
[6482.00 --> 6482.36]  Oh wait,
[6482.46 --> 6482.68]  what?
[6483.20 --> 6483.48]  Oh,
[6483.52 --> 6484.40]  that's such a hack.
[6484.78 --> 6485.02]  What?
[6485.12 --> 6487.14]  The second one totally is the TV.
[6487.32 --> 6488.90]  It wasn't published this year.
[6488.98 --> 6489.24]  So I put,
[6489.40 --> 6490.24]  Oh,
[6490.28 --> 6493.12]  it's the ones that got the most views this year.
[6493.16 --> 6493.46]  Okay.
[6493.92 --> 6495.64]  I'm giving myself some credit for that one.
[6496.28 --> 6499.88]  Cause I only excluded it because I thought it was ones that were published this year.
[6499.98 --> 6500.08]  Yeah.
[6500.14 --> 6500.50]  Fair enough.
[6500.62 --> 6500.80]  Okay.
[6500.82 --> 6501.98]  I don't know what the third one is.
[6502.22 --> 6503.34]  I don't know what the third one is.
[6504.72 --> 6505.74]  No way.
[6506.78 --> 6507.14]  This,
[6507.14 --> 6511.00]  this one like bombed out of the gate.
[6511.52 --> 6512.74]  5.3 million.
[6513.02 --> 6513.30]  3.
[6513.50 --> 6513.70]  Yeah.
[6513.70 --> 6515.32]  This one did not do well.
[6515.52 --> 6516.08]  Hold on.
[6516.12 --> 6516.52]  I'm not,
[6516.60 --> 6516.86]  uh,
[6516.86 --> 6518.38]  I'm not logged into the right account here,
[6518.40 --> 6518.98]  but let's go,
[6519.10 --> 6519.88]  let's go find it.
[6522.00 --> 6523.78]  I'll show you guys like this one.
[6524.70 --> 6527.32]  It was supposed to be like a,
[6527.32 --> 6530.98]  like a sequel to a top performer because this is a,
[6531.12 --> 6532.16]  the EVGA classified.
[6532.16 --> 6533.24]  Wow.
[6534.38 --> 6534.58]  Yeah.
[6534.68 --> 6535.16]  So like,
[6535.16 --> 6536.00]  dude,
[6536.46 --> 6537.60]  this started,
[6537.70 --> 6538.80]  eh,
[6539.00 --> 6539.36]  come on.
[6539.66 --> 6543.02]  This started like at the low end of typical.
[6543.24 --> 6543.54]  Yep.
[6543.96 --> 6549.68]  And then just reached escape velocity and then just has not slowed down.
[6549.68 --> 6549.82]  Never stopped.
[6550.48 --> 6552.40]  15,000 views today.
[6552.60 --> 6555.54]  Like just casually racking them up.
[6555.54 --> 6555.80]  Yep.
[6556.62 --> 6556.98]  That doesn't.
[6556.98 --> 6560.58]  30,000 views last 48 hours for a video that old is crazy.
[6560.74 --> 6562.04]  It doesn't happen that much anymore.
[6562.04 --> 6566.04]  It used to be how our entire channel growth was architected.
[6566.60 --> 6567.36]  We talked about.
[6567.48 --> 6567.68]  Yeah.
[6567.88 --> 6568.24]  Was just,
[6568.32 --> 6570.76]  you make evergreen content and it just like gets views forever,
[6570.76 --> 6573.82]  but only a few of them,
[6574.00 --> 6576.18]  only a few of them break out like that.
[6576.34 --> 6576.58]  Yeah.
[6577.22 --> 6577.62]  All right.
[6577.62 --> 6578.94]  What was our bonus fourth?
[6580.64 --> 6582.10]  They left this in my driveway.
[6582.22 --> 6584.32]  The Cluvin's Scorpion gaming chair.
[6584.44 --> 6584.64]  Yeah.
[6585.18 --> 6585.42]  Yeah.
[6585.42 --> 6585.86]  There you go.
[6586.18 --> 6587.16]  That's such a great thing.
[6587.16 --> 6588.10]  I forgot that was this year.
[6588.10 --> 6589.46]  And the fact that that,
[6589.54 --> 6589.80]  that,
[6589.90 --> 6591.80]  that title is not clickbait.
[6591.80 --> 6593.54]  Like that's actually what happened.
[6593.64 --> 6597.40]  We ordered the thing and they just dumped it like in the driveway.
[6597.52 --> 6599.64]  They didn't even sign for it.
[6599.80 --> 6601.40]  Like they just left it there.
[6601.48 --> 6602.66]  Like really?
[6604.04 --> 6605.24]  That seems a little silly.
[6605.70 --> 6606.78]  Absolutely wild.
[6607.80 --> 6608.20]  Um,
[6608.44 --> 6608.78]  okay.
[6608.78 --> 6611.52]  Most commented video with 13,000 comments.
[6611.60 --> 6612.74]  That's gotta be the iPhone video.
[6612.86 --> 6613.44]  There's no way.
[6614.04 --> 6614.36]  Oh no,
[6614.40 --> 6614.88]  it was the,
[6615.08 --> 6615.38]  uh,
[6615.38 --> 6617.50]  the $5,000 PC in the Taiwanese tech mall.
[6617.88 --> 6619.60]  And then the next one was April fools.
[6619.72 --> 6619.92]  That,
[6620.00 --> 6620.68]  that checks out.
[6620.76 --> 6621.04]  Oh man,
[6621.08 --> 6622.84]  are none of them the iPhone video is the last one.
[6622.94 --> 6623.90]  The last one was the iPhone.
[6624.06 --> 6624.34]  Okay.
[6625.18 --> 6627.48]  10,800 comments on.
[6627.48 --> 6629.90]  I really tried Apple iPhone 30 day challenge.
[6629.96 --> 6630.90]  I'm still using it by the way,
[6630.96 --> 6632.28]  but only because I'm lazy.
[6633.00 --> 6633.36]  Um,
[6633.52 --> 6635.76]  and migrating WhatsApp off of iPhone.
[6635.86 --> 6638.58]  I've heard is even worse than migrating WhatsApp onto the iPhone.
[6638.94 --> 6641.22]  So I'm really not looking forward to that because I,
[6641.26 --> 6643.98]  I used to lose my chat history all the time.
[6643.98 --> 6646.50]  And that's one of the reasons that I stuck with the note nine for so long.
[6646.66 --> 6647.10]  Honestly,
[6647.10 --> 6649.78]  I don't know why people keep using WhatsApp to be honest.
[6650.32 --> 6650.72]  I mean,
[6650.90 --> 6652.88]  I've,
[6652.88 --> 6654.34]  I've never understood how it's survived.
[6654.74 --> 6655.60]  It's fine.
[6655.96 --> 6657.38]  But like the,
[6657.64 --> 6658.78]  so is everything else.
[6659.18 --> 6659.98]  Everything's fine.
[6660.92 --> 6662.86]  It's where my chat history is.
[6663.32 --> 6664.18]  I think there's a,
[6664.18 --> 6664.90]  no,
[6664.96 --> 6665.04]  no,
[6665.04 --> 6666.44]  I haven't lost it in like six years.
[6666.56 --> 6666.74]  Oh,
[6666.76 --> 6666.94]  okay.
[6667.08 --> 6667.26]  Yeah.
[6667.28 --> 6670.24]  I used to lose my chat history all the time.
[6670.24 --> 6671.28]  Like I didn't even,
[6671.44 --> 6673.34]  I didn't even realize with,
[6673.34 --> 6673.56]  uh,
[6673.56 --> 6677.08]  cause like text message migration would be really sloppy unless you like went and
[6677.08 --> 6679.44]  did it at the store or with like the proper app or whatever.
[6679.44 --> 6682.40]  So I'm not saying a lot of people don't still use it.
[6682.48 --> 6683.54]  Tons of people still use it.
[6683.62 --> 6684.90]  I just don't understand.
[6685.02 --> 6688.88]  And then like losing my WeChat history was super inconvenient at one point.
[6688.96 --> 6690.28]  I don't know if you recall that.
[6690.38 --> 6690.58]  Yes.
[6690.72 --> 6690.92]  Uh,
[6690.92 --> 6694.56]  but I had a lot of people accuse me of impropriety because I didn't have
[6694.56 --> 6696.32]  WeChat receipts for something.
[6696.38 --> 6696.72]  I'm like,
[6696.72 --> 6699.14]  I didn't even realize it didn't cloud backup.
[6699.22 --> 6699.52]  I don't know.
[6699.58 --> 6701.10]  I'm just like China not have the cloud.
[6701.10 --> 6701.36]  Like,
[6701.46 --> 6702.22]  okay.
[6702.40 --> 6703.60]  I thought they keep everything.
[6704.24 --> 6705.50]  I'm sure somebody has it.
[6705.64 --> 6707.04]  Can you give it back to me?
[6707.08 --> 6707.40]  Please.
[6708.48 --> 6709.56]  At least a copy.
[6710.16 --> 6710.56]  Um,
[6711.38 --> 6712.32]  and then yeah,
[6712.40 --> 6712.92]  WhatsApp,
[6713.22 --> 6713.56]  uh,
[6713.56 --> 6716.28]  the migration just like kind of like kind of sucks.
[6716.28 --> 6718.78]  Like you can at least use it across multiple devices now,
[6718.84 --> 6720.68]  which is a big upgrade.
[6721.24 --> 6721.64]  Um,
[6721.76 --> 6722.94]  this is what I mean.
[6723.02 --> 6723.20]  Yeah,
[6723.24 --> 6723.46]  I know.
[6723.48 --> 6723.74]  I know.
[6723.76 --> 6724.18]  I get it.
[6724.60 --> 6724.92]  I don't,
[6725.00 --> 6725.68]  I don't understand.
[6725.88 --> 6726.30]  I get it.
[6726.86 --> 6727.28]  Um,
[6727.58 --> 6728.44]  it's just,
[6728.44 --> 6728.84]  it's been,
[6729.00 --> 6732.52]  it's been pretty sticky because almost everyone I know uses either that or
[6732.52 --> 6733.18]  Facebook messenger.
[6734.02 --> 6734.34]  Um,
[6734.34 --> 6736.28]  and Facebook messenger is,
[6736.44 --> 6736.68]  um,
[6736.68 --> 6739.56]  is like the predominant one for like organizing group events.
[6740.04 --> 6743.60]  And then WhatsApp is the big one for like group chats.
[6743.90 --> 6744.16]  Yeah.
[6744.58 --> 6744.90]  Um,
[6745.08 --> 6745.30]  what,
[6745.40 --> 6745.54]  uh,
[6745.54 --> 6746.46]  when it's your heart out?
[6746.58 --> 6747.76]  Is it 17 minutes from now?
[6748.26 --> 6748.48]  No.
[6749.38 --> 6749.78]  Yeah.
[6750.10 --> 6750.48]  Oh,
[6750.70 --> 6751.06]  six.
[6751.12 --> 6751.40]  Okay.
[6752.06 --> 6752.38]  Sweet.
[6752.62 --> 6760.28]  As for our best like ratios at the power color factory tour at 99.08%.
[6760.28 --> 6760.70]  Honestly,
[6760.76 --> 6761.14]  not surprised.
[6761.20 --> 6761.80]  That was a cool video.
[6761.84 --> 6762.62]  That was a wicked video.
[6762.66 --> 6763.56]  That was an awesome video.
[6763.68 --> 6763.76]  Oh,
[6763.76 --> 6764.42]  it's tied though.
[6764.94 --> 6768.92]  Tied with hello old friend media ripping explained.
[6769.12 --> 6770.54]  That was a thick video.
[6770.74 --> 6770.98]  Yeah.
[6770.98 --> 6772.26]  Like it was dense.
[6772.52 --> 6772.64]  Yeah.
[6772.78 --> 6773.16]  Um,
[6773.50 --> 6775.42]  very like information heavy.
[6775.74 --> 6776.14]  Uh,
[6776.14 --> 6777.36]  how did that end up performing?
[6777.56 --> 6778.30]  That's what I'm checking.
[6778.50 --> 6778.66]  Yeah.
[6778.66 --> 6782.18]  Hello old friend.
[6782.26 --> 6782.62]  Here we are.
[6782.70 --> 6783.44]  I'm bringing up the dashboard.
[6784.18 --> 6784.66]  Yeah.
[6784.90 --> 6785.12]  The,
[6785.18 --> 6785.26]  see,
[6785.32 --> 6785.82]  this is,
[6785.90 --> 6791.10]  this is more typical these days where even something that performs really well.
[6791.34 --> 6791.78]  Flatlines.
[6792.80 --> 6793.32]  Flatlines.
[6793.32 --> 6793.52]  Flatlines.
[6793.94 --> 6794.26]  High,
[6794.48 --> 6794.74]  but.
[6795.52 --> 6795.66]  Yeah.
[6795.98 --> 6796.52]  But like,
[6796.52 --> 6797.50]  because it got there right away.
[6797.50 --> 6797.90]  Yeah.
[6797.90 --> 6798.44]  In August,
[6798.60 --> 6800.14]  it had 1.54 million.
[6800.26 --> 6801.00]  Like for contrast,
[6801.12 --> 6801.40]  what's it?
[6801.40 --> 6801.66]  Yeah.
[6801.66 --> 6802.32]  Last 48,
[6802.44 --> 6802.74]  22,
[6802.82 --> 6803.08]  30.
[6803.34 --> 6803.50]  Yeah.
[6804.02 --> 6805.34]  So basically dead.
[6805.52 --> 6808.20]  So this kind of like how to rip media,
[6808.20 --> 6808.94]  whatever.
[6809.24 --> 6814.56]  The only reason this shot up like this is because it had a really good title and thumbnail.
[6814.82 --> 6815.70]  And then that's it.
[6816.06 --> 6816.48]  It's like,
[6816.54 --> 6816.70]  they're,
[6816.70 --> 6817.48]  they're not going to keep,
[6817.56 --> 6819.02]  they're not going to keep serving this.
[6820.70 --> 6821.10]  Bummer.
[6821.80 --> 6822.24]  YouTube's,
[6822.30 --> 6822.48]  uh,
[6822.48 --> 6823.40]  YouTube's just different now.
[6823.40 --> 6826.40]  And you have to adapt to the meta or you die.
[6826.64 --> 6830.88]  Knowing that a lot of evergreen just dies and knowing that the audience is actually surprisingly
[6830.88 --> 6831.54]  cyclical.
[6832.10 --> 6832.50]  Um,
[6833.38 --> 6834.90]  would you consider remaking old videos?
[6835.10 --> 6837.64]  Cause I know that was a thing that you were hardline on.
[6837.82 --> 6838.08]  No,
[6838.20 --> 6838.62]  in the past.
[6838.62 --> 6838.76]  Yeah,
[6838.78 --> 6839.16]  absolutely.
[6839.54 --> 6839.78]  Yeah.
[6839.96 --> 6840.50]  At this point.
[6840.58 --> 6840.74]  Yeah.
[6840.90 --> 6842.46]  It seems like it makes sense now,
[6842.58 --> 6844.12]  especially cause like there's,
[6844.22 --> 6845.52]  there's new information that,
[6845.52 --> 6845.90]  you know,
[6845.90 --> 6849.76]  hadn't come out or we didn't know or has changed.
[6850.02 --> 6850.38]  Yeah.
[6850.42 --> 6852.24]  Or you can just do a better job potentially.
[6852.52 --> 6852.60]  Yeah.
[6852.60 --> 6853.40]  Like a lot of them,
[6853.70 --> 6854.26]  especially from the,
[6854.34 --> 6855.34]  like the really early days,
[6855.42 --> 6856.56]  how to water cool a PC,
[6856.86 --> 6859.28]  the last guide you'll ever need in 4k.
[6859.54 --> 6859.78]  Yeah,
[6859.86 --> 6860.08]  sure.
[6860.12 --> 6860.28]  You know,
[6860.28 --> 6860.72]  or whatever.
[6860.98 --> 6861.16]  Yeah.
[6861.24 --> 6861.80]  Like we could,
[6861.90 --> 6864.24]  I think we could even go back to some of the old,
[6864.28 --> 6864.68]  like,
[6865.42 --> 6865.66]  uh,
[6865.70 --> 6866.88]  NCIX tech tips.
[6867.04 --> 6867.46]  The green.
[6867.72 --> 6868.12]  Um,
[6868.12 --> 6868.78]  like there are,
[6868.86 --> 6871.28]  there are videos that I literally,
[6871.28 --> 6872.62]  um,
[6873.48 --> 6874.30]  haven't made.
[6874.34 --> 6874.74]  Cause I'm like,
[6874.78 --> 6874.90]  ah,
[6874.92 --> 6875.08]  no,
[6875.14 --> 6875.34]  we,
[6875.42 --> 6876.52]  we did that on NCIX.
[6877.00 --> 6877.36]  Yeah.
[6877.36 --> 6877.72]  Hold on.
[6878.32 --> 6878.60]  Next.
[6878.60 --> 6880.14]  Here we go.
[6880.54 --> 6880.82]  Yeah.
[6880.86 --> 6882.36]  Ultimate water cooling guide.
[6882.74 --> 6883.18]  Yes.
[6883.76 --> 6884.82]  13 years ago.
[6885.66 --> 6886.06]  Buddy.
[6886.26 --> 6887.46]  We've been doing this for a while.
[6887.62 --> 6888.12]  I know,
[6888.20 --> 6888.48]  right?
[6889.58 --> 6891.48]  This was pretty early Luke shot.
[6891.66 --> 6891.86]  Yeah.
[6892.34 --> 6892.74]  Um,
[6893.42 --> 6895.08]  Luke tried to figure out water cooling,
[6895.24 --> 6896.66]  but it turns out he lied on his resume.
[6896.84 --> 6897.82]  So he didn't know how to do anything.
[6899.60 --> 6904.12]  That was one of the fun moments when he left me to water cool two GPUs and just left the room.
[6904.18 --> 6905.58]  I've never water cooled anything before.
[6905.92 --> 6907.32]  I've done no water cooling before.
[6907.32 --> 6908.30]  And I had to take the,
[6908.30 --> 6909.20]  the,
[6909.20 --> 6909.48]  the,
[6909.48 --> 6909.50]  the,
[6909.50 --> 6911.74]  the years off two GPUs.
[6911.78 --> 6912.04]  That was,
[6912.16 --> 6912.46]  uh,
[6912.76 --> 6913.12]  terrifying.
[6913.38 --> 6913.68]  Yeah.
[6913.84 --> 6914.18]  Well,
[6914.66 --> 6915.94]  he didn't do it.
[6915.98 --> 6917.08]  I ended up having to do it.
[6917.12 --> 6917.22]  No,
[6917.22 --> 6919.12]  I came back and I,
[6919.30 --> 6920.36]  I think you weren't done yet.
[6920.38 --> 6921.48]  I think I had to at least help.
[6921.62 --> 6921.92]  Yeah.
[6922.18 --> 6922.60]  That's probably,
[6922.64 --> 6922.96]  I was like,
[6922.98 --> 6923.64]  how you've been doing it.
[6923.64 --> 6924.64]  You've been here for so long.
[6924.64 --> 6925.52]  What's taking so long?
[6925.62 --> 6927.14]  That wasn't entirely true.
[6927.34 --> 6930.52]  We've talked about this a few times because you didn't actually give me very much time.
[6930.72 --> 6932.74]  There were other parts you didn't have enough time for.
[6932.74 --> 6935.80]  You definitely had enough time when I wanted those heat sinks stripped off.
[6935.86 --> 6936.08]  Okay.
[6936.16 --> 6936.80]  That's probably fair.
[6936.94 --> 6937.16]  This,
[6937.48 --> 6937.66]  um,
[6937.66 --> 6938.46]  the last one,
[6938.48 --> 6938.84]  uh,
[6938.84 --> 6942.36]  at 99.06% was the sensible tech upgrade.
[6942.46 --> 6943.40]  That was Sebastian's.
[6943.66 --> 6944.08]  Uh,
[6944.30 --> 6944.46]  dude,
[6944.46 --> 6945.96]  his place is so stylin'.
[6945.96 --> 6947.22]  That was a really good video.
[6947.42 --> 6947.68]  Yeah.
[6948.88 --> 6949.24]  Honestly,
[6949.40 --> 6951.70]  the tech upgrades in general are just like pretty awesome.
[6952.10 --> 6952.28]  I,
[6952.36 --> 6952.56]  I,
[6952.62 --> 6954.06]  I love the tech upgrade series.
[6954.54 --> 6955.32]  1 million.
[6955.44 --> 6955.72]  Wow.
[6956.02 --> 6956.86]  That's not even that old.
[6957.06 --> 6957.28]  Yep.
[6957.28 --> 6957.70]  They're just,
[6957.80 --> 6958.74]  they're just reliable.
[6959.28 --> 6960.06]  They're just reliable.
[6960.24 --> 6964.58]  Our team is so cool that all you have to really do is like hang out with one for a bit.
[6964.58 --> 6965.28]  And then,
[6965.28 --> 6965.64]  yeah,
[6965.70 --> 6967.04]  like people love them.
[6967.32 --> 6968.56]  And this place is so interesting.
[6968.64 --> 6970.04]  All his little projects are so interesting.
[6970.16 --> 6970.30]  Yeah.
[6970.40 --> 6970.92]  Not even little.
[6971.22 --> 6973.58]  All his like incredibly professional projects.
[6974.54 --> 6974.74]  Yep.
[6974.74 --> 6976.94]  That's a lot.
[6977.06 --> 6979.88]  And the team puts so much work into stuff these days.
[6979.88 --> 6980.92]  Like those little extras,
[6980.92 --> 6983.94]  like the amount of work that went into just having an entire,
[6983.94 --> 6987.08]  like couple of master cartons of screwdrivers on the Island.
[6987.20 --> 6987.74]  There's like,
[6987.74 --> 6989.24]  it's extra,
[6989.40 --> 6990.14]  I think is the,
[6990.14 --> 6990.94]  the term for it.
[6991.12 --> 6991.28]  Yeah.
[6993.12 --> 6993.56]  Uh,
[6993.56 --> 6994.38]  discussion question.
[6994.48 --> 6996.04]  How'd you feel about 2024?
[6996.34 --> 6996.94]  What'd you achieve?
[6996.98 --> 6997.58]  Any surprises,
[6997.74 --> 6998.36]  disappointments?
[6998.50 --> 6998.72]  Um,
[6998.76 --> 6999.46]  it was a tough year.
[6999.88 --> 7000.12]  Uh,
[7000.12 --> 7002.02]  2024 was a really tough year.
[7002.18 --> 7002.58]  Uh,
[7002.58 --> 7003.90]  we were coming off of,
[7003.90 --> 7004.56]  um,
[7004.74 --> 7006.62]  we were coming off of,
[7006.62 --> 7007.42]  um,
[7007.42 --> 7009.16]  some allegations that,
[7009.36 --> 7009.58]  you know,
[7009.64 --> 7009.98]  after,
[7010.36 --> 7012.32]  after the investigation was completed,
[7012.32 --> 7012.80]  we,
[7012.98 --> 7015.52]  we released our statement that said the,
[7015.52 --> 7016.16]  um,
[7016.20 --> 7016.40]  the,
[7016.60 --> 7020.30]  the investigation found that the allegations were unfounded and unfair.
[7021.02 --> 7021.50]  Um,
[7021.56 --> 7021.92]  so,
[7022.12 --> 7022.40]  you know,
[7022.44 --> 7024.44]  going through all of that,
[7024.44 --> 7025.30]  um,
[7025.54 --> 7027.46]  when the allegations were,
[7027.58 --> 7029.16]  according again to the investigation,
[7029.38 --> 7031.04]  unfounded and unfair,
[7031.04 --> 7031.82]  uh,
[7031.82 --> 7033.80]  was extremely challenging,
[7033.80 --> 7034.34]  uh,
[7034.34 --> 7036.16]  for me personally and for us as a company.
[7037.04 --> 7037.44]  Um,
[7038.72 --> 7039.64]  you know,
[7039.78 --> 7041.02]  I think that,
[7041.02 --> 7041.56]  we don't,
[7041.66 --> 7042.66]  a lot of people pretty heavily.
[7042.78 --> 7042.90]  Yeah,
[7042.90 --> 7043.42]  for sure.
[7043.64 --> 7044.08]  For sure.
[7044.20 --> 7044.56]  And,
[7044.92 --> 7046.32]  and there was a lot of stuff that,
[7046.32 --> 7047.80]  um,
[7047.80 --> 7050.80]  uh,
[7050.80 --> 7054.96]  there's a lot of stuff that people didn't see behind the scenes that made it,
[7055.02 --> 7055.68]  that made it really hard.
[7056.42 --> 7056.78]  Um,
[7058.02 --> 7058.76]  what we achieved,
[7058.80 --> 7059.48]  I think is we,
[7059.56 --> 7060.36]  we got our groove back.
[7060.48 --> 7060.80]  We,
[7061.12 --> 7061.52]  we're,
[7061.52 --> 7062.18]  we're back to,
[7062.32 --> 7063.50]  we're back to kind of killing it.
[7063.58 --> 7063.90]  It's always,
[7064.18 --> 7065.24]  it's always cyclical.
[7065.44 --> 7065.76]  Like,
[7065.78 --> 7066.10]  I think,
[7066.14 --> 7066.36]  uh,
[7066.36 --> 7066.50]  we,
[7066.50 --> 7069.56]  we talked in that recent all hands about how we're like back to,
[7069.56 --> 7070.02]  you know,
[7070.06 --> 7073.24]  before viewership and it's a little down this month,
[7073.24 --> 7073.98]  but you know,
[7075.00 --> 7076.04]  it do be like that though.
[7076.08 --> 7076.28]  I mean,
[7076.28 --> 7079.04]  I think there's going to be a lot of people upgrading when 50 series comes out.
[7079.10 --> 7080.62]  I think there's going to be a lot of buzz around that.
[7080.62 --> 7082.10]  So there'll be some,
[7082.10 --> 7083.44]  some upswing there and,
[7083.54 --> 7084.62]  and then it'll be down again.
[7084.62 --> 7085.34]  It'll be up and,
[7085.44 --> 7085.52]  you know,
[7085.54 --> 7085.84]  whatever.
[7086.00 --> 7086.14]  Right.
[7087.60 --> 7088.00]  Um,
[7088.76 --> 7091.26]  yeah.
[7091.36 --> 7092.44]  Dyslexic stoner says,
[7092.54 --> 7092.96]  um,
[7093.24 --> 7094.88]  I'll admit I stopped watching for a while.
[7094.88 --> 7096.62]  I couldn't stand having another person.
[7096.68 --> 7097.82]  I like turn out to be a monster.
[7098.04 --> 7098.44]  Uh,
[7098.44 --> 7099.38]  was glad it wasn't true.
[7099.94 --> 7100.28]  Um,
[7100.46 --> 7100.68]  yeah,
[7100.76 --> 7100.92]  no,
[7100.96 --> 7101.60]  there was a,
[7102.20 --> 7103.32]  there was a big,
[7103.44 --> 7105.84]  there was a big,
[7105.84 --> 7106.84]  um,
[7112.84 --> 7113.24]  yeah,
[7113.36 --> 7117.10]  there was a big group of people that just stopped watching and there's a
[7117.10 --> 7119.22]  significant group that,
[7119.46 --> 7119.78]  you know,
[7119.84 --> 7122.62]  if their comments are to be believed have never come back.
[7122.80 --> 7123.88]  And that's sad.
[7124.26 --> 7124.70]  Um,
[7124.70 --> 7125.56]  that's really sad.
[7125.70 --> 7126.78]  And it's still sad for me.
[7127.02 --> 7127.60]  I think it's true.
[7127.82 --> 7128.06]  Yeah.
[7128.26 --> 7131.78]  Cause there's also like that stuff went so far and wide.
[7131.84 --> 7132.04]  We'll,
[7132.24 --> 7134.66]  you'll never be able to reach all of those people again.
[7135.12 --> 7135.48]  Um,
[7136.00 --> 7137.02]  yeah.
[7137.54 --> 7137.94]  Yeah.
[7138.12 --> 7138.68]  Really tough.
[7139.96 --> 7140.36]  Um,
[7142.00 --> 7142.54]  as for,
[7143.04 --> 7143.78]  as for what's,
[7143.86 --> 7143.94]  uh,
[7143.94 --> 7145.24]  welcome to the next quarter of a century.
[7145.36 --> 7145.86]  Oh my goodness.
[7146.20 --> 7146.40]  Yeah.
[7146.80 --> 7152.52]  Did you know star Wars 1977 was released closer to the year 2000 than any video we
[7152.52 --> 7153.14]  made this year?
[7160.50 --> 7162.40]  I'm just going to close that topic.
[7163.14 --> 7164.38]  Why don't we move on?
[7165.66 --> 7166.10]  Yes.
[7166.94 --> 7167.34]  Yes.
[7167.34 --> 7168.16]  Let's do that.
[7168.70 --> 7172.64]  There's a fake Nintendo lawyer sending out DMCA takedowns.
[7172.88 --> 7173.84]  A few months ago,
[7173.94 --> 7174.24]  YouTuber,
[7174.46 --> 7179.76]  Dominic Domtendo Neumeier received DMCA takedowns on his legend of Zelda echoes of
[7179.76 --> 7180.04]  wisdom.
[7180.16 --> 7180.88]  Let's play videos.
[7180.88 --> 7181.72]  However,
[7182.16 --> 7187.98]  after some back and forth with the Tatsumi Masaaki protonmail.com account,
[7188.70 --> 7189.12]  um,
[7190.60 --> 7194.58]  Domtendo reached out to Nintendo itself who responded that the emailer was not using a
[7194.58 --> 7196.04]  legitimate Nintendo email address.
[7196.28 --> 7196.66]  Oh yeah.
[7196.76 --> 7197.40]  A few weeks later,
[7197.46 --> 7200.64]  the YouTuber received a followup from that same email with a short message.
[7200.86 --> 7203.18]  I hereby retract all of my preceding claims.
[7203.18 --> 7208.14]  Although the threatening email would start to come from a spoofed anti dash piracy three
[7208.14 --> 7215.06]  at Nintendo.co.jp email rumors of fake takedowns from big red last circled when Gary's mod
[7215.06 --> 7219.34]  removed all Nintendo related fan content after receiving DMCA's originating from suspicious
[7219.34 --> 7220.24]  looking emails.
[7220.46 --> 7222.70]  The developer claims to have verified the source though.
[7223.14 --> 7228.20]  Nintendo and partners have also been accused of using AI tools to issue mass takedowns.
[7228.58 --> 7228.94]  Um,
[7228.94 --> 7229.88]  that was just a quick,
[7230.16 --> 7230.82]  a quick topic.
[7231.24 --> 7231.56]  Um,
[7231.56 --> 7232.62]  I want to talk about this one.
[7232.62 --> 7232.66]  Um,
[7233.12 --> 7238.60]  this is called my experience as a winner turned into disqualification by Nvidia.
[7238.78 --> 7240.72]  And this was actually flagged for me,
[7240.72 --> 7242.24]  um,
[7242.66 --> 7244.04]  before the show,
[7244.12 --> 7244.64]  like just a,
[7244.70 --> 7245.92]  just a little while before the show.
[7245.96 --> 7247.50]  So it was posted six hours ago on the forum.
[7248.00 --> 7248.48]  But,
[7248.56 --> 7248.98]  um,
[7249.00 --> 7254.34]  this poster in our community said they were officially declared a winner and their project
[7254.34 --> 7256.40]  was publicly listed on Nvidia platforms.
[7256.40 --> 7258.44]  They were supposed to win a winner.
[7258.44 --> 7258.70]  Yeah.
[7258.80 --> 7259.68]  I think it was,
[7259.74 --> 7259.92]  uh,
[7259.92 --> 7260.06]  yeah,
[7260.12 --> 7260.58]  here we go.
[7260.58 --> 7261.08]  So,
[7261.08 --> 7265.00]  and Nvidia RTX 6000 added generation graphics card.
[7265.08 --> 7267.04]  So like a really valuable GPU.
[7267.56 --> 7271.66]  And then after declaring them a winner and sending them through a bunch of hoops,
[7271.80 --> 7274.66]  they apparently were disqualified,
[7274.66 --> 7275.82]  um,
[7275.82 --> 7281.00]  for reasons that Nvidia has not apparently been able to properly explain.
[7281.00 --> 7285.58]  So they've just asked us to highlight this because I hope I,
[7285.58 --> 7286.68]  I'd like to assume,
[7286.88 --> 7287.44]  you know,
[7287.98 --> 7289.32]  incompetence where,
[7289.32 --> 7290.18]  um,
[7290.94 --> 7292.72]  where malice has not yet been proven,
[7292.72 --> 7293.44]  uh,
[7293.44 --> 7295.82]  where hopefully by getting some visibility on this,
[7295.86 --> 7297.38]  we can at least get them a,
[7297.38 --> 7298.00]  uh,
[7298.00 --> 7299.30]  a satisfactory answer.
[7299.30 --> 7303.98]  So what they're asking for is if anyone from Nvidia reads this,
[7303.98 --> 7308.40]  I respectfully ask for my project to be reviewed by a team of qualified technical experts.
[7308.40 --> 7311.02]  My only goal is to ensure fairness and transparency.
[7311.46 --> 7313.00]  Thank you all for taking the time to read this.
[7313.06 --> 7314.86]  I appreciate any help that you can provide.
[7314.86 --> 7317.12]  So they provided a link to their project,
[7317.12 --> 7317.52]  um,
[7317.52 --> 7318.30]  to their GitHub repo.
[7319.12 --> 7319.32]  So,
[7319.44 --> 7319.72]  um,
[7319.74 --> 7320.38]  that's on there.
[7320.46 --> 7323.40]  Just wanted to make sure that we,
[7323.54 --> 7323.80]  uh,
[7323.80 --> 7328.26]  we kind of highlighted that we like to make sure that we're taking care of our community members.
[7328.26 --> 7329.30]  And this seemed like,
[7329.78 --> 7332.52]  seems like there's gotta be something going on here.
[7332.70 --> 7334.88]  They should at least get an explanation.
[7337.12 --> 7338.12]  Oh no.
[7341.90 --> 7342.38]  Ah,
[7343.66 --> 7344.80]  do you want to do the AI?
[7344.86 --> 7345.34]  Uh,
[7348.34 --> 7349.52]  oh no,
[7349.70 --> 7350.52]  I didn't even know this.
[7350.66 --> 7350.94]  Uh,
[7351.00 --> 7352.64]  by a vote of four to three,
[7352.84 --> 7359.02]  the Arizona state board for charter schools approved an application to open a fully online school,
[7359.02 --> 7362.50]  which will serve grades four to eight.
[7362.90 --> 7363.42]  Um,
[7363.52 --> 7366.56]  that doesn't automatically sound all that bad.
[7366.64 --> 7366.92]  Uh,
[7366.92 --> 7372.40]  unbound Academy hopes to use AI to condense academic instruction into a two hour window,
[7372.40 --> 7374.00]  which now sounds really bad,
[7374.00 --> 7374.50]  uh,
[7374.50 --> 7379.16]  to free up time for life skill workshops covering financial literacy,
[7379.16 --> 7380.38]  public speaking,
[7380.66 --> 7381.38]  goal setting,
[7381.76 --> 7382.30]  entrepreneurship,
[7382.76 --> 7383.36]  critical thinking,
[7383.48 --> 7384.56]  and creative problem solving,
[7384.98 --> 7386.90]  which sounds great.
[7387.76 --> 7388.96]  Except in theory,
[7388.96 --> 7390.16]  uh,
[7390.16 --> 7390.60]  quote,
[7390.60 --> 7390.62]  quote,
[7390.62 --> 7393.96]  as students work through lessons on subjects like math,
[7394.04 --> 7394.22]  reading,
[7394.22 --> 7394.76]  and science,
[7394.76 --> 7397.28]  the AI system will analyze their responses,
[7397.28 --> 7399.66]  time spent on tasks,
[7399.66 --> 7405.42]  and even emotional cues to optimize the difficulty and presentation of content.
[7405.42 --> 7407.60]  That sounds ambitious.
[7408.36 --> 7409.44]  Good luck with that.
[7409.98 --> 7410.52]  Wow.
[7410.52 --> 7411.46]  That sounds like,
[7411.56 --> 7411.90]  um,
[7413.06 --> 7414.42]  that sounds like a,
[7414.42 --> 7414.66]  uh,
[7414.66 --> 7416.76]  like a Stanley parables style,
[7416.76 --> 7418.62]  like video game level of,
[7418.70 --> 7421.24]  of issue when it would be applied to the workplace.
[7421.24 --> 7423.52]  And this feels like to me,
[7423.52 --> 7426.26]  some amount of desensitization before it gets applied to the workplace,
[7426.26 --> 7427.84]  but we'll see.
[7428.16 --> 7428.36]  Uh,
[7428.36 --> 7432.30]  unbound Academy has been trialing this two hour learning method in Texas,
[7432.74 --> 7433.80]  seemingly in person,
[7433.80 --> 7438.26]  and has applications to open other schools in Arkansas and Utah.
[7438.74 --> 7444.88]  Experts have questioned the effectiveness of personalized education programs and have called it Orwellian,
[7444.88 --> 7450.36]  an Orwellian misnomer for replacing teachers with digital services and data mining software.
[7451.40 --> 7451.64]  Yeah.
[7451.98 --> 7452.44]  Uh,
[7452.44 --> 7456.60]  much of the criticism stems from the lack of clarity behind the term.
[7457.06 --> 7457.22]  Yep.
[7457.54 --> 7461.66]  Personalized learning is perhaps like personalized ads,
[7461.86 --> 7462.24]  i.e.
[7462.26 --> 7462.92]  data collection,
[7463.20 --> 7464.30]  a form of doublespeak,
[7464.40 --> 7465.10]  says Adam.
[7465.18 --> 7467.02]  And I strongly agree.
[7467.50 --> 7467.92]  Um,
[7467.96 --> 7468.68]  discussion question.
[7468.82 --> 7473.90]  Do you think kids need that real connection with teachers in order to do well?
[7473.90 --> 7475.22]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[7475.46 --> 7475.74]  Yeah.
[7475.88 --> 7476.60]  Not necessarily.
[7476.84 --> 7476.96]  Oh,
[7477.06 --> 7477.38]  I do.
[7477.50 --> 7480.66]  But what they definitely need is a real connection with other students.
[7481.54 --> 7481.94]  Oh,
[7482.34 --> 7482.82]  yeah.
[7482.90 --> 7483.80]  A hundred percent.
[7483.98 --> 7484.80]  And in theory,
[7484.94 --> 7485.30]  good point.
[7485.54 --> 7488.58]  This is freeing up time for life skill workshops,
[7488.62 --> 7489.86]  covering financial literacy,
[7490.02 --> 7490.62]  public speaking,
[7490.76 --> 7491.12]  goal setting,
[7491.26 --> 7491.66]  entrepreneurship,
[7491.86 --> 7492.36]  critical thinking,
[7492.42 --> 7493.32]  and creative problem solving.
[7493.72 --> 7494.92]  In practice,
[7496.02 --> 7501.08]  homeschooling is an extremely poorly regulated area.
[7501.76 --> 7502.16]  Um,
[7502.16 --> 7507.22]  I strongly recommend watching the John Oliver segment on it.
[7508.36 --> 7508.80]  Um,
[7509.08 --> 7509.30]  Oh,
[7509.40 --> 7509.56]  cool.
[7509.88 --> 7510.10]  Yeah.
[7511.04 --> 7514.60]  And I'm not saying that you have to agree with John Oliver on everything,
[7514.60 --> 7517.70]  but what I will say is that as far as,
[7517.70 --> 7518.42]  um,
[7519.42 --> 7521.62]  as far as background research goes,
[7522.28 --> 7523.00]  um,
[7523.56 --> 7525.14]  they do a pretty darn good job.
[7525.14 --> 7527.30]  And this just feels like,
[7527.30 --> 7530.64]  this just feels like homeschooling with extra steps.
[7531.64 --> 7532.30]  To me,
[7532.30 --> 7535.10]  it feels like if you're going to have a problem kid,
[7535.10 --> 7538.12]  it's just going to be exacerbated so much.
[7539.16 --> 7539.56]  Um,
[7539.90 --> 7542.50]  because without someone there being able to do something about it,
[7542.82 --> 7543.36]  uh,
[7543.40 --> 7543.84]  I don't know.
[7543.84 --> 7547.08]  What if they just frown at the AI camera for like five minutes?
[7547.08 --> 7547.76]  What does it do?
[7551.76 --> 7552.16]  Nothing,
[7552.36 --> 7552.60]  nothing.
[7552.74 --> 7557.00]  Does it make the tasks easier because it detects kid is upset?
[7557.42 --> 7557.78]  Like,
[7558.54 --> 7560.90]  I don't know.
[7561.84 --> 7565.48]  Assuming that every single kid is just going to do this perfectly seems.
[7566.14 --> 7566.86]  But I mean,
[7566.90 --> 7570.54]  assuming every kid is going to do traditional school perfectly,
[7570.82 --> 7571.08]  you know,
[7571.14 --> 7571.76]  it's not right either.
[7571.76 --> 7574.88]  The whole reason why the teachers are there or a big part of it.
[7574.88 --> 7575.44]  But I mean,
[7575.44 --> 7576.70]  not every teacher is great.
[7576.80 --> 7577.04]  I mean,
[7577.10 --> 7578.42]  I definitely agree.
[7578.84 --> 7579.06]  You know,
[7579.10 --> 7579.40]  one of,
[7579.48 --> 7581.16]  one of my most frustrating experiences,
[7581.16 --> 7582.84]  every person had at least one bad teacher.
[7582.92 --> 7583.08]  Yeah.
[7583.20 --> 7588.76]  One of my most frustrating experiences being in school was knowing from having
[7588.76 --> 7592.88]  parents who were teachers and from having my teachers who were teachers and,
[7593.04 --> 7593.16]  you know,
[7593.18 --> 7595.00]  seeing a little bit of the inside baseball,
[7595.18 --> 7600.98]  knowing that competency was not necessarily the most important attribute for
[7600.98 --> 7603.50]  keeping your job and getting promotions and raises.
[7603.76 --> 7604.18]  Yeah.
[7604.18 --> 7604.96]  seniority.
[7605.38 --> 7605.60]  Yeah.
[7605.70 --> 7606.52]  It was politics,
[7606.82 --> 7607.16]  you know,
[7607.20 --> 7607.32]  that,
[7607.44 --> 7608.80]  and that's not how,
[7609.26 --> 7609.48]  yeah,
[7609.52 --> 7610.60]  that's not how things should be done.
[7610.64 --> 7610.84]  Right.
[7611.60 --> 7612.04]  Um,
[7613.60 --> 7614.04]  anyway,
[7614.22 --> 7614.46]  yeah,
[7614.48 --> 7614.70]  good,
[7614.80 --> 7615.24]  good luck,
[7615.32 --> 7615.66]  Arizona.
[7616.12 --> 7616.54]  Um,
[7617.96 --> 7618.32]  I,
[7618.64 --> 7624.38]  I am deeply worried about the,
[7624.50 --> 7627.20]  I'm,
[7627.20 --> 7629.10]  I'm deeply worried about education.
[7629.84 --> 7630.56]  Top Gear said,
[7630.62 --> 7630.72]  no,
[7630.78 --> 7632.74]  there will be a baseline and it'll be monitored.
[7632.74 --> 7633.74]  It won't be so easy.
[7633.86 --> 7634.98]  They graduate below level.
[7635.40 --> 7635.88]  Um,
[7635.98 --> 7636.20]  yeah,
[7636.20 --> 7637.74]  but you can't fail kids anymore.
[7638.62 --> 7639.68]  That's a whole thing.
[7640.10 --> 7640.86]  So like,
[7641.18 --> 7642.38]  actually,
[7642.52 --> 7643.66]  it totally could be.
[7643.66 --> 7647.82]  I don't know.
[7647.82 --> 7647.84]  I don't know.
[7648.38 --> 7651.82]  I don't have a great answer and I'm not in that field.
[7652.66 --> 7653.24]  I don't have a kid,
[7653.74 --> 7657.82]  but education doesn't feel like it's going in a fantastic direction.
[7658.16 --> 7658.34]  The no,
[7658.34 --> 7659.44]  I feel bad for the kids.
[7659.58 --> 7661.30]  The no child left behind paradigm,
[7661.50 --> 7662.22]  um,
[7662.64 --> 7663.68]  feels like,
[7665.24 --> 7669.54]  it feels sort of.
[7670.98 --> 7671.64]  Conrad says.
[7671.64 --> 7672.70]  Like a good idea,
[7673.18 --> 7673.72]  like a,
[7673.76 --> 7676.38]  or a warm idea that in practice,
[7676.38 --> 7677.02]  uh,
[7677.02 --> 7680.62]  I just don't really understand why we're still giving it any credence.
[7681.00 --> 7681.62]  Conrad says,
[7681.62 --> 7684.32]  my mom is a teacher and says the upcoming generation is not okay.
[7684.96 --> 7688.42]  And I don't think it's their fault to be super clear at all.
[7688.52 --> 7690.90]  I think the,
[7691.00 --> 7693.58]  the current powers that be are setting them up for failure.
[7694.38 --> 7694.82]  Um,
[7695.48 --> 7696.00]  I don't,
[7696.06 --> 7696.90]  I don't think it's the kids.
[7702.26 --> 7702.66]  Yeah.
[7703.54 --> 7703.98]  Anyways.
[7703.98 --> 7706.84]  Yeah.
[7707.22 --> 7709.08]  Inventor two boy five says,
[7709.22 --> 7709.34]  yeah,
[7709.34 --> 7710.76]  that's what my sister's telling me too.
[7710.88 --> 7711.68]  She's a teacher too.
[7711.76 --> 7713.28]  They are super uninterested in learning.
[7714.34 --> 7714.74]  Um,
[7715.72 --> 7716.26]  yeah,
[7716.38 --> 7716.86]  I'm,
[7716.92 --> 7720.46]  I'm reminded of that famous misattributed quote.
[7721.26 --> 7721.74]  Um,
[7725.76 --> 7729.62]  that is not actually from peanuts.
[7729.98 --> 7733.48]  And Linus didn't actually say this in the strip.
[7733.98 --> 7734.34]  But,
[7734.42 --> 7734.70]  uh,
[7735.54 --> 7737.32]  so good.
[7739.68 --> 7740.52]  That's pretty good.
[7742.04 --> 7742.44]  Yeah.
[7742.66 --> 7743.66]  It's stuck with me though.
[7744.10 --> 7744.36]  Yeah.
[7744.70 --> 7745.02]  I mean,
[7745.02 --> 7745.76]  it feels like that,
[7745.80 --> 7745.94]  right?
[7748.42 --> 7748.82]  Yeah.
[7748.88 --> 7749.88]  Actual attribution,
[7749.88 --> 7750.32]  uh,
[7750.32 --> 7751.46]  Asada Shakur.
[7753.08 --> 7753.70]  All right.
[7756.98 --> 7760.26]  Open AI outlines new for-profit corporate structure.
[7760.66 --> 7760.96]  Nice.
[7761.44 --> 7763.60]  They've outlined a plan to change their corporate structure by
[7763.60 --> 7766.88]  transforming its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation,
[7767.62 --> 7771.36]  a company structured to balance the interests of society with shareholder value,
[7771.58 --> 7773.32]  which should make securing investors easier.
[7773.72 --> 7776.46]  They recently completed a $6.6 billion funding round,
[7776.60 --> 7778.00]  $4 billion from Amazon alone,
[7778.00 --> 7780.78]  and currently have a $157 billion valuation.
[7781.48 --> 7786.06]  The proposed change comes after Elon Musk dropped a lawsuit claiming a for-profit structure would be illegal.
[7786.42 --> 7788.62]  Musk and Sam Altman worked together for nine,
[7788.84 --> 7794.68]  worked together nine years ago to launch Open AI as a non-profit with the mission statement to develop generative AI for the benefit of society.
[7795.40 --> 7800.14]  Musk left in 2018 after seeming frustrations over the company taking billions in funding from Microsoft.
[7800.14 --> 7801.38]  Um,
[7802.10 --> 7802.50]  also,
[7802.78 --> 7806.22]  failing to gain a majority stake in the company for himself might have had something to do with it.
[7806.86 --> 7807.26]  Yeah.
[7807.60 --> 7808.00]  Yeah,
[7808.00 --> 7809.34]  there's been the whole thing with the-
[7809.34 --> 7810.58]  Might have suddenly made that okay.
[7811.06 --> 7811.22]  Yeah,
[7811.40 --> 7811.68]  yep,
[7811.74 --> 7811.92]  yep,
[7811.92 --> 7812.08]  yep,
[7812.08 --> 7812.26]  yep,
[7812.26 --> 7812.42]  yep,
[7812.42 --> 7812.52]  yep,
[7812.52 --> 7812.70]  yep.
[7813.24 --> 7813.62]  Anywho,
[7813.98 --> 7814.20]  uh,
[7814.20 --> 7815.26]  that's it for our topics.
[7815.64 --> 7815.90]  Oh,
[7815.96 --> 7816.48]  Dan left.
[7817.02 --> 7817.38]  Cool.
[7817.64 --> 7817.92]  Well,
[7818.04 --> 7820.06]  we're going to switch to After Dark when Dan comes back.
[7820.08 --> 7820.60]  In the meantime,
[7821.32 --> 7821.98]  um-
[7821.98 --> 7823.52]  I could read some off if you want.
[7823.74 --> 7823.94]  Oh,
[7823.98 --> 7824.82]  what happened to the,
[7824.88 --> 7825.22]  uh,
[7825.46 --> 7827.06]  oh,
[7827.24 --> 7829.50]  I have another GoFundMe that,
[7829.64 --> 7831.24]  unlike the one we talked about earlier,
[7831.24 --> 7832.22]  is,
[7832.38 --> 7832.78]  um,
[7832.84 --> 7834.36]  not a downer.
[7834.70 --> 7835.18]  And,
[7835.28 --> 7835.44]  oh,
[7835.48 --> 7835.60]  hey,
[7835.64 --> 7836.12]  look at that!
[7836.62 --> 7837.30]  Passes goal.
[7837.62 --> 7838.16]  Let's go!
[7838.26 --> 7838.40]  Wait,
[7838.78 --> 7839.34]  did we-
[7839.34 --> 7839.58]  Oh,
[7839.74 --> 7840.02]  okay,
[7840.12 --> 7840.30]  well,
[7840.40 --> 7841.98]  I mean,
[7842.04 --> 7842.48]  you know what?
[7843.46 --> 7844.20]  That's cool.
[7844.70 --> 7848.28]  Some anonymous person yesterday donated a thousand dollars.
[7849.68 --> 7850.16]  Uh,
[7850.26 --> 7851.96]  Reboot Rewind has a GoFundMe.
[7851.98 --> 7854.82]  You guys can feel free to resurrect this,
[7854.82 --> 7855.12]  uh,
[7855.12 --> 7858.18]  iconic animated show from my childhood.
[7858.38 --> 7861.26]  It's actually the first fully computer animated TV show.
[7861.54 --> 7861.98]  Uh,
[7862.02 --> 7862.80]  here's some footage.
[7863.02 --> 7863.30]  Um,
[7863.86 --> 7864.20]  yep,
[7864.30 --> 7864.84]  pretty awesome.
[7864.92 --> 7865.88]  You guys can check that out.
[7866.66 --> 7866.94]  There.
[7870.80 --> 7873.30]  I did not end up stalling for very long.
[7873.40 --> 7873.62]  No.
[7873.84 --> 7874.20]  Uh,
[7874.22 --> 7875.14]  do you want me to read some off?
[7875.90 --> 7876.22]  Oh,
[7876.40 --> 7876.78]  uh,
[7876.80 --> 7877.02]  yeah,
[7877.02 --> 7877.54]  we could do that,
[7877.58 --> 7878.32]  or we could wait for Dan.
[7878.88 --> 7879.28]  They'll wait.
[7879.88 --> 7880.24]  Okay.
[7880.62 --> 7880.98]  Oh,
[7881.04 --> 7882.58]  we don't actually have a lot of time to kill though.
[7882.66 --> 7883.40]  That's what I'm-
[7883.40 --> 7883.56]  Yeah,
[7883.60 --> 7884.32]  I kind of have to,
[7884.38 --> 7885.50]  I have to leave at some point.
[7885.60 --> 7885.78]  Okay.
[7886.02 --> 7887.42]  There aren't a ton of them either though.
[7887.76 --> 7888.00]  Oh,
[7888.04 --> 7889.54]  has Dan been filtering a lot of them?
[7889.58 --> 7890.46]  There's only 10.
[7891.22 --> 7891.50]  Oh,
[7891.76 --> 7892.04]  okay.
[7893.12 --> 7893.42]  They,
[7893.58 --> 7893.88]  uh,
[7895.08 --> 7898.62]  apparently people just don't care about leaving merch messages.
[7898.80 --> 7898.92]  Yeah,
[7898.96 --> 7899.74]  because there was-
[7899.74 --> 7900.62]  Bought a lot of backpacks.
[7900.62 --> 7904.00]  I think he also was maybe pretty aggressive with the curating because there was a decent
[7904.00 --> 7904.76]  amount of merch messages.
[7906.44 --> 7906.84]  Okay.
[7907.00 --> 7909.36]  I'll let you guys know how many discount codes are left.
[7909.96 --> 7910.40]  Uh,
[7910.44 --> 7911.78]  we are down to,
[7912.28 --> 7912.50]  oh,
[7912.58 --> 7913.40]  mental math is hard.
[7913.62 --> 7914.94]  We're down to about 3,500.
[7915.84 --> 7916.24]  So,
[7916.44 --> 7920.42]  we have a couple videos that are queued to go up this weekend that have call-outs for the
[7920.42 --> 7921.04]  commuter bag.
[7921.28 --> 7922.14]  It's after dark time,
[7922.22 --> 7922.32]  Dan.
[7922.50 --> 7922.80]  And,
[7922.80 --> 7925.88]  I'm a little worried that we might have to YouTube editor,
[7926.04 --> 7926.20]  like,
[7926.30 --> 7927.20]  cut out the part,
[7927.40 --> 7927.66]  uh,
[7927.66 --> 7928.84]  referring to the discount code.
[7929.88 --> 7930.80]  We'll see how it goes.
[7931.02 --> 7931.66]  Burn so many of them.
[7932.52 --> 7932.66]  Yeah.
[7935.04 --> 7935.44]  Yeah.
[7935.52 --> 7936.06]  Let's do it.
[7936.06 --> 7938.84]  I must have missed a topic change.
[7938.96 --> 7939.60]  Sorry about that.
[7939.70 --> 7939.82]  No,
[7939.88 --> 7940.20]  you're good,
[7940.26 --> 7940.40]  Dan.
[7941.00 --> 7941.76]  Don't even trip,
[7941.88 --> 7942.04]  dog.
[7942.68 --> 7943.42]  I'm tripping.
[7946.82 --> 7947.54]  Look at that.
[7947.82 --> 7948.42]  Now it's dark.
[7948.80 --> 7949.32]  So good.
[7950.00 --> 7950.22]  Dude,
[7950.28 --> 7950.46]  I,
[7950.46 --> 7950.70]  I,
[7950.70 --> 7951.88]  I,
[7952.80 --> 7954.36]  I,
[7954.36 --> 7959.88]  I have been an absolute lump for the last two days.
[7960.30 --> 7963.18]  I don't remember the last time I did less.
[7963.46 --> 7964.32]  I didn't even,
[7964.40 --> 7966.74]  I didn't even respond to social messages.
[7966.74 --> 7968.38]  Like Luke messaged me over the holiday,
[7968.38 --> 7969.30]  actually with some,
[7969.44 --> 7973.00]  some stuff that probably merited paying attention to.
[7973.60 --> 7976.12]  I was a little surprised you didn't respond.
[7976.68 --> 7977.10]  I was like,
[7977.12 --> 7977.42]  okay,
[7977.58 --> 7977.82]  I mean,
[7977.82 --> 7978.36]  it's fine.
[7979.06 --> 7980.08]  He's probably busy.
[7980.08 --> 7980.44]  So,
[7980.78 --> 7981.68]  so initially,
[7981.68 --> 7988.10]  initially I just had a lot of family stuff going on up until the 25th or until the 25th.
[7988.36 --> 7989.88]  And I think I've,
[7989.92 --> 7993.82]  I think I've updated you on like my family being a little complicated right now.
[7994.28 --> 7995.16]  So that was,
[7995.24 --> 7996.52]  I assumed there was stuff going on.
[7996.66 --> 7996.94]  I wasn't,
[7996.94 --> 7998.06]  I wasn't bothered by it.
[7998.06 --> 7998.38]  Um,
[7998.38 --> 7999.04]  and then,
[7999.60 --> 8001.98]  and then on the 25th and the 26th,
[8001.98 --> 8002.40]  I,
[8002.50 --> 8006.42]  I went and played badminton with my in-laws and my son.
[8006.66 --> 8007.10]  Nice.
[8007.34 --> 8008.38]  And other than that,
[8008.38 --> 8011.24]  did literally actually nothing.
[8011.76 --> 8013.04]  And then yesterday,
[8013.04 --> 8014.24]  um,
[8014.38 --> 8020.88]  I went and played some badminton in the evening because I looked at my step counter and I had like 400 steps.
[8020.98 --> 8021.46]  Whoa.
[8021.46 --> 8021.58]  Whoa.
[8022.02 --> 8023.96]  I did actually nothing.
[8024.40 --> 8027.42]  So you probably saw me on steam like all day yesterday.
[8027.84 --> 8028.22]  Like I went,
[8028.30 --> 8028.48]  nah.
[8028.68 --> 8030.42]  Yesterday was my family's Christmas.
[8030.58 --> 8030.94]  Got it.
[8031.06 --> 8031.20]  Yeah.
[8031.26 --> 8032.72]  So if you'd been on your computer,
[8033.16 --> 8036.44]  you would have seen me on steam doing absolutely nothing.
[8036.84 --> 8040.14]  I am substantially ahead of you in final fantasy six.
[8040.14 --> 8040.62]  I do.
[8040.86 --> 8041.26]  Okay.
[8041.26 --> 8045.62]  And I only played yesterday and a little bit in the evening the day before.
[8045.88 --> 8046.26]  You know,
[8046.32 --> 8047.64]  it shouldn't be an always thing,
[8047.90 --> 8048.36]  but it's,
[8048.42 --> 8050.58]  it's not a bad idea to slow down every once in a while.
[8050.60 --> 8053.02]  I don't remember the last time that I've done it.
[8053.48 --> 8054.32]  And you know what?
[8054.34 --> 8055.70]  It was kind of glorious,
[8055.90 --> 8055.98]  but,
[8056.10 --> 8057.48]  but at the end of the day yesterday,
[8057.48 --> 8058.14]  I was like,
[8058.76 --> 8059.76]  really brother?
[8059.94 --> 8060.32]  Okay.
[8060.70 --> 8062.50]  So I dragged my,
[8062.58 --> 8063.82]  I dragged my butt to smash.
[8063.96 --> 8067.40]  I played for a couple hours and then I jumped on the stair master for 10 minutes.
[8067.46 --> 8068.44]  I found out my step rate,
[8068.48 --> 8068.88]  by the way.
[8069.22 --> 8069.62]  Um,
[8069.62 --> 8072.88]  the speed that I'm doing is 133 steps per minute.
[8073.28 --> 8073.72]  So,
[8074.24 --> 8075.06]  um,
[8075.10 --> 8078.32]  it says 350 Watts on the,
[8078.44 --> 8079.42]  on the thing.
[8079.76 --> 8081.24]  So I only did,
[8081.46 --> 8082.50]  I only did 10 minutes.
[8082.76 --> 8082.94]  No,
[8083.06 --> 8084.40]  but I think that's really good.
[8084.50 --> 8086.56]  I only did 10 minutes of that yesterday.
[8086.86 --> 8087.30]  Uh,
[8087.30 --> 8088.50]  but what I've been doing,
[8088.50 --> 8089.32]  um,
[8089.66 --> 8093.80]  before when I told you that I would cycle between the machines is I've been trying to do half an hour.
[8094.02 --> 8095.72]  And so I've been doing,
[8095.98 --> 8096.34]  um,
[8096.92 --> 8099.60]  for rowing two minutes for every five minutes.
[8099.62 --> 8101.78]  500 meters is about the pace that I target.
[8102.08 --> 8102.28]  Yeah.
[8102.36 --> 8103.60]  And then for the stair master,
[8103.60 --> 8104.96]  I've been doing,
[8104.96 --> 8105.36]  uh,
[8105.36 --> 8105.74]  that.
[8106.14 --> 8108.64]  So I've been doing 133 steps per minute.
[8108.64 --> 8110.56]  And then for the bike,
[8110.56 --> 8112.46]  I've been targeting about 140 Watts.
[8112.80 --> 8113.80]  So that was,
[8113.92 --> 8116.58]  that's my like half an hour continuous that I've been trying to do.
[8116.70 --> 8119.70]  I've fallen off the wagon a little bit over the last couple of days,
[8119.70 --> 8120.16]  as I,
[8120.28 --> 8121.14]  as I already told you,
[8121.14 --> 8123.48]  but when the,
[8123.62 --> 8123.82]  uh,
[8123.82 --> 8126.50]  when those badminton players come out here for the collab,
[8126.50 --> 8133.44]  I want to be at the point where I can comfortably do half an hour of continuous,
[8133.44 --> 8137.56]  like crazy cardio rod.
[8137.56 --> 8138.78]  My God,
[8138.86 --> 8139.22]  I've got her,
[8139.30 --> 8139.48]  please.
[8140.02 --> 8143.04]  So we've all read that at the same time.
[8145.54 --> 8149.24]  I want to be able to do 15 minutes continuous on the stair master at that speed.
[8150.02 --> 8150.38]  And,
[8150.44 --> 8150.76]  uh,
[8150.76 --> 8152.16]  I didn't expect that for Rod.
[8152.16 --> 8155.04]  And then I'm going to bookend it with the bike and the rower.
[8155.38 --> 8155.74]  Nice.
[8155.82 --> 8156.90]  So I'm thinking I'll go,
[8157.08 --> 8158.06]  Oh man,
[8158.12 --> 8158.52]  what will I,
[8158.64 --> 8159.36]  what will I do?
[8159.66 --> 8160.02]  Yeah.
[8160.02 --> 8161.90]  Cause the bike is really tough on the thighs too.
[8161.96 --> 8163.98]  I might have to find like a third cardio machine.
[8163.98 --> 8165.32]  That's not just pure legs.
[8166.04 --> 8166.72]  Cause the,
[8166.92 --> 8167.00]  you,
[8167.10 --> 8168.10]  isn't there an elliptical there?
[8168.70 --> 8169.02]  Oh yeah,
[8169.04 --> 8169.48]  that's true.
[8169.60 --> 8172.20]  Elliptical is your most well-rounded whole body one that you have.
[8173.14 --> 8173.50]  Okay.
[8173.60 --> 8173.72]  Yeah.
[8173.72 --> 8176.14]  Maybe I'll do elliptical then.
[8176.40 --> 8177.18]  So I could do,
[8177.46 --> 8179.52]  but you got to actually operate the handles.
[8180.00 --> 8180.30]  Yeah.
[8180.30 --> 8180.54]  Well,
[8180.54 --> 8182.24]  I'm going to need to because my legs will be dead.
[8182.40 --> 8182.54]  Yeah.
[8182.58 --> 8188.68]  So maybe I could do the elliptical last so I could row and then jump on the stair master
[8188.68 --> 8191.98]  and then do the elliptical for the last five minutes.
[8192.36 --> 8193.18]  Pull it into your,
[8193.24 --> 8193.40]  yeah,
[8193.40 --> 8193.66]  I know.
[8193.78 --> 8193.94]  Yeah.
[8195.04 --> 8196.96]  I did try out for the rowing team.
[8197.44 --> 8197.66]  Oh,
[8197.70 --> 8197.96]  nice.
[8198.32 --> 8198.50]  Yeah.
[8198.72 --> 8198.92]  Yeah.
[8199.50 --> 8200.54]  That's as far as I got.
[8200.86 --> 8201.88]  They did invite me.
[8202.04 --> 8203.82]  They did invite me to be the coxswain.
[8204.18 --> 8204.58]  Ah,
[8204.66 --> 8204.86]  yeah.
[8205.60 --> 8205.92]  Light.
[8206.38 --> 8206.60]  Yeah.
[8207.20 --> 8207.82]  And loud.
[8208.10 --> 8208.32]  Yeah.
[8208.46 --> 8208.80]  Oh yeah.
[8208.80 --> 8209.10]  Yeah.
[8209.10 --> 8209.30]  Yeah.
[8209.30 --> 8209.52]  Yeah.
[8209.52 --> 8210.84]  Makes sense.
[8211.62 --> 8212.20]  All right.
[8212.24 --> 8212.46]  Hit me,
[8212.54 --> 8212.64]  Dan.
[8213.30 --> 8213.60]  Hi.
[8214.22 --> 8217.16]  What big house upgrades or projects do you have in the works?
[8217.32 --> 8219.14]  I struggle with permanent modifications,
[8219.34 --> 8219.70]  for example,
[8219.80 --> 8221.12]  throwing holes in the walls.
[8221.26 --> 8223.12]  So I love watching home upgrades.
[8223.32 --> 8223.58]  Okay.
[8224.68 --> 8225.12]  Okay.
[8225.90 --> 8227.62]  I am going to do this.
[8228.16 --> 8230.98]  I want to build like an epic cat wall.
[8232.02 --> 8236.62]  Like with all the like things and the things and the ropes and the things that can climb and
[8236.62 --> 8236.74]  stuff.
[8236.74 --> 8238.92]  I want the entire upstairs hallway essentially.
[8239.30 --> 8239.56]  Oh,
[8239.70 --> 8239.90]  sick.
[8239.90 --> 8241.32]  To be just like cat jungle,
[8241.68 --> 8242.52]  jungle gym,
[8242.60 --> 8242.98]  not jungle.
[8243.20 --> 8243.44]  Nice.
[8243.70 --> 8243.86]  Yeah.
[8244.20 --> 8245.42]  And I would honestly,
[8245.76 --> 8246.04]  I would,
[8246.20 --> 8247.74]  we can never close doors in our house.
[8248.06 --> 8252.68]  So I would honestly love to work out some kind of like tunnel system so they can get in
[8252.68 --> 8253.34]  and out of rooms.
[8253.34 --> 8254.72]  The problem is that.
[8254.78 --> 8256.30]  So that then you could close doors.
[8256.38 --> 8256.52]  Yeah.
[8256.52 --> 8256.96]  Yeah.
[8257.06 --> 8257.98]  For my room,
[8258.10 --> 8261.84]  I do have sound isolation requirements.
[8263.24 --> 8264.02]  You know,
[8264.74 --> 8265.52]  and so.
[8265.78 --> 8266.02]  I would,
[8266.12 --> 8267.06]  that that's good.
[8267.22 --> 8267.42]  Really?
[8267.76 --> 8267.80]  Yeah.
[8267.80 --> 8267.98]  Yeah.
[8267.98 --> 8268.12]  Yeah.
[8268.12 --> 8268.26]  Yeah.
[8268.26 --> 8268.34]  Yeah.
[8268.34 --> 8272.34]  So what I was kind of thinking is maybe what we could do.
[8272.34 --> 8273.34]  You could just get like a plug.
[8274.12 --> 8276.60]  Cause the cats whine if we close our door.
[8276.60 --> 8278.94]  But if we had just a hole,
[8278.94 --> 8281.64]  then there would always be sound leakage,
[8281.64 --> 8282.86]  which is not better.
[8283.18 --> 8283.32]  Yeah.
[8283.42 --> 8287.22]  So what I'm kind of thinking is maybe I could,
[8287.22 --> 8287.90]  um,
[8290.14 --> 8296.84]  maybe I could make like a cat thing and then they could go into like a tunnel that takes
[8296.84 --> 8299.12]  them up through the attic to somewhere else on the cat thing.
[8299.18 --> 8302.16]  So they could get in and out of our room all the time,
[8302.22 --> 8303.20]  but we could just close our door.
[8303.80 --> 8304.16]  So,
[8304.26 --> 8306.58]  or something like that so that there wouldn't be a clear path for,
[8306.60 --> 8307.16]  or for sound.
[8307.30 --> 8310.60]  You could make like a baffles basically that they have to like walk through.
[8311.66 --> 8312.02]  Yeah.
[8312.24 --> 8312.48]  Yeah.
[8312.76 --> 8313.00]  Yeah.
[8313.14 --> 8313.36]  Yeah,
[8313.36 --> 8313.72]  exactly.
[8313.94 --> 8315.20]  I think something like that would be cool.
[8315.56 --> 8315.92]  Don't worry.
[8315.92 --> 8317.80]  They're not going to go up in the attic.
[8317.90 --> 8318.82]  We'll enclose it.
[8318.98 --> 8319.34]  Obviously.
[8319.52 --> 8320.00]  Come on guys.
[8320.48 --> 8321.46]  Give me some credit here.
[8321.54 --> 8322.90]  Give me some credit here.
[8324.44 --> 8324.84]  Um,
[8325.52 --> 8326.52]  other than that,
[8326.90 --> 8327.32]  like,
[8327.40 --> 8327.88]  I don't know,
[8327.98 --> 8329.50]  fixing the roof solar.
[8329.62 --> 8329.86]  Oh,
[8329.92 --> 8330.64]  the light switches.
[8330.82 --> 8331.16]  Oh man.
[8331.76 --> 8334.12]  Because we've actually had like two days off.
[8334.62 --> 8336.06]  Yvonne's been learning to crochet.
[8336.60 --> 8339.48]  Cause like her husband's busy playing video games,
[8339.54 --> 8339.80]  I guess.
[8340.70 --> 8341.40]  Time to,
[8341.56 --> 8342.98]  time to go full old lady.
[8343.76 --> 8344.20]  Um,
[8344.62 --> 8347.92]  and she's been like reaming me about our horrible light switches.
[8347.92 --> 8351.22]  Cause I need an Avelli to hurry up and get me those millimeter wave switches.
[8351.90 --> 8352.36]  Yeah.
[8352.36 --> 8353.38]  I think those are the big ones.
[8353.50 --> 8354.22]  They are pretty horrible.
[8354.46 --> 8354.64]  Yeah,
[8354.64 --> 8355.52]  they are pretty horrible.
[8355.66 --> 8357.12]  Did you just turn off all the time?
[8359.50 --> 8360.18]  Next up.
[8360.78 --> 8361.00]  Sure.
[8361.00 --> 8362.10]  Oh,
[8362.22 --> 8362.64]  clapped.
[8363.32 --> 8364.62]  K24 Accord says,
[8364.76 --> 8365.38]  I'm an insulator.
[8365.52 --> 8368.34]  I always find it hilarious when parents soundproof their bedrooms.
[8368.56 --> 8370.30]  It's a very common option.
[8371.62 --> 8372.02]  Yeah.
[8372.66 --> 8372.96]  I mean,
[8372.98 --> 8373.70]  that's considerate.
[8373.74 --> 8374.28]  It's a good thing.
[8374.38 --> 8374.98]  It's considerate.
[8375.06 --> 8375.24]  Yeah.
[8375.28 --> 8375.58]  Why not?
[8375.66 --> 8376.24]  It's considerate.
[8377.30 --> 8378.08]  Healthy bedrooms.
[8379.72 --> 8381.08]  Now soundproofed.
[8381.50 --> 8381.94]  Yeah.
[8382.10 --> 8383.68]  The kids don't have to hear all the fighting.
[8384.14 --> 8384.34]  Yeah.
[8384.34 --> 8384.48]  Yeah.
[8384.48 --> 8384.62]  Yeah.
[8384.62 --> 8384.86]  Yeah.
[8384.86 --> 8385.30]  That's it.
[8385.48 --> 8385.74]  Yeah.
[8385.80 --> 8386.32]  There you go.
[8386.52 --> 8387.74]  My family friendly.
[8387.74 --> 8388.06]  Well,
[8388.18 --> 8389.54]  maybe so much worse.
[8389.82 --> 8390.04]  Yeah.
[8390.50 --> 8391.26]  Actually worse.
[8391.46 --> 8392.10]  So much worse.
[8393.00 --> 8393.90]  Literally worse.
[8395.06 --> 8395.38]  Linus,
[8395.46 --> 8395.90]  Linus,
[8395.96 --> 8396.30]  Luke and Dan,
[8396.40 --> 8401.76]  how do the three of you individually maintain the desire and effort levels to keep working
[8401.76 --> 8402.46]  on your hobbies?
[8402.74 --> 8405.38]  How do you keep pushing yourselves to be better at your jobs?
[8406.44 --> 8406.88]  Well,
[8406.92 --> 8408.54]  you guys push me to be better at my job.
[8409.64 --> 8410.08]  So,
[8410.26 --> 8411.04]  so there's that.
[8411.04 --> 8411.24]  I mean,
[8411.32 --> 8413.36]  I think we also push ourselves a lot.
[8413.36 --> 8414.56]  Um,
[8415.44 --> 8418.52]  as for maintaining effort levels for my hobbies,
[8418.84 --> 8422.24]  do I badminton badminton?
[8422.44 --> 8422.62]  I do.
[8422.72 --> 8423.34]  I do.
[8423.42 --> 8425.66]  I'm highly motivated to be better at it.
[8426.16 --> 8426.64]  I,
[8426.76 --> 8427.18]  um,
[8427.42 --> 8430.38]  it's the motivation for me is that it counts as exercise.
[8430.68 --> 8434.04]  So I don't feel like I'm wasting time when I'm playing badminton,
[8434.04 --> 8436.20]  unless I sign up for a session.
[8436.34 --> 8438.52]  That's like tournaments feel like a waste of time.
[8438.52 --> 8439.52]  Those are an indulgence.
[8440.04 --> 8440.68]  If I play a tournament,
[8440.68 --> 8446.22]  I know that I'm playing like 20% of the time and I could have easily done a lot of other stuff in that time.
[8446.76 --> 8447.16]  Um,
[8447.24 --> 8447.70]  but no,
[8447.78 --> 8448.86]  I thought that's the easy.
[8448.92 --> 8450.88]  Do you see tournaments as like a benchmark though?
[8451.38 --> 8451.76]  Absolutely.
[8451.82 --> 8452.54]  Check where you're at.
[8452.66 --> 8452.84]  Yeah.
[8452.94 --> 8453.10]  Oh,
[8453.20 --> 8453.30]  dude,
[8453.68 --> 8454.14]  we actually,
[8454.26 --> 8454.70]  my team,
[8454.80 --> 8455.78]  instead of coming eighth,
[8455.92 --> 8456.54]  like last year,
[8456.58 --> 8457.78]  we came ninth this year,
[8457.78 --> 8459.40]  but I actually,
[8459.64 --> 8460.68]  I don't mind that result.
[8460.74 --> 8462.44]  It doesn't actually feel like a downgrade,
[8462.50 --> 8463.72]  especially for me personally,
[8463.72 --> 8469.28]  because the only reason we're ninth is because our first match at 9am on the first day
[8469.28 --> 8472.92]  was the one that determined that we would have no shot at the top eight.
[8473.16 --> 8473.56]  Oh,
[8473.70 --> 8475.22]  because the way the seating worked,
[8475.30 --> 8475.86]  uh,
[8475.86 --> 8476.08]  we,
[8476.24 --> 8483.90]  we were seated two within our group of four for round Robin and we played number three and it was close.
[8484.18 --> 8485.70]  Their team won three games.
[8485.88 --> 8486.70]  Ours won two,
[8486.84 --> 8489.78]  but two of the ones we lost went to deuce,
[8489.92 --> 8490.60]  which is,
[8490.60 --> 8491.12]  um,
[8492.06 --> 8494.18]  and one of the ones went to deuce in the third set.
[8494.62 --> 8498.60]  So basically that means that's where you're tied at the end and you have to win by two.
[8498.82 --> 8499.18]  Yeah.
[8499.38 --> 8499.78]  Um,
[8500.40 --> 8502.44]  so it was really close.
[8502.44 --> 8505.80]  And then once that was over that very first match,
[8505.80 --> 8506.46]  uh,
[8506.46 --> 8507.98]  the next one was basically a walkover.
[8508.10 --> 8510.74]  We played the fourth seed and like they,
[8510.86 --> 8511.12]  you know,
[8511.16 --> 8511.30]  they,
[8511.40 --> 8512.86]  they tried hard and whatever,
[8512.86 --> 8514.68]  but there was a different class of team.
[8514.82 --> 8515.08]  Yeah.
[8515.08 --> 8515.74]  And then,
[8515.74 --> 8516.30]  uh,
[8516.30 --> 8516.56]  our,
[8516.70 --> 8519.46]  our last one in our round Robin was a walkover for the other team.
[8519.56 --> 8521.90]  They were the top seed and I think they went on to win.
[8521.90 --> 8526.90]  So basically the team that we lost fairly,
[8527.66 --> 8528.62]  barely two,
[8529.00 --> 8529.92]  they weren't even eighth.
[8530.02 --> 8531.92]  They were like higher than eighth,
[8532.04 --> 8535.46]  but because we lost two in our round Robin stage,
[8535.46 --> 8537.24]  the best we could do was nine.
[8537.24 --> 8537.72]  You guys were screwed.
[8537.84 --> 8537.92]  Yeah.
[8538.00 --> 8539.84]  And then the following day we won all the way through.
[8540.06 --> 8540.24]  Yeah.
[8540.26 --> 8541.12]  So we came in ninth.
[8541.26 --> 8541.48]  Yeah.
[8541.60 --> 8543.04]  So I don't even feel that bad about it.
[8543.04 --> 8544.78]  And in that first one,
[8544.82 --> 8545.82]  I won my game.
[8546.66 --> 8547.06]  Um,
[8547.06 --> 8547.28]  I,
[8547.34 --> 8551.88]  I played a men's doubles and I played against the person that I lost.
[8551.90 --> 8554.94]  I lost two in my final game the previous year,
[8554.94 --> 8557.34]  which was what put us in eighth instead of seventh.
[8557.40 --> 8557.78]  And I won.
[8558.02 --> 8558.24]  Cool.
[8558.30 --> 8558.54]  So,
[8558.74 --> 8560.12]  so personally,
[8560.12 --> 8562.20]  I felt like it was a pretty big upgrade.
[8562.32 --> 8563.56]  I played really well.
[8563.64 --> 8567.50]  The only games I lost were the one that was against the team that won.
[8567.98 --> 8568.80]  And one of the,
[8568.88 --> 8572.38]  one of the kids that was on the other team literally plays at like a national
[8572.38 --> 8572.74]  level,
[8573.14 --> 8573.80]  like currently,
[8574.18 --> 8574.56]  I'm like,
[8574.58 --> 8574.88]  okay,
[8575.00 --> 8575.44]  whatever.
[8575.64 --> 8576.58]  I got a few points.
[8576.88 --> 8577.78]  I feel good about that.
[8577.86 --> 8577.88]  Yeah.
[8577.88 --> 8578.06]  Yeah.
[8578.06 --> 8579.60]  And then the other one I lost,
[8579.92 --> 8580.22]  um,
[8580.22 --> 8581.22]  I retired from,
[8581.58 --> 8581.86]  uh,
[8581.86 --> 8582.94]  my team had already won.
[8583.04 --> 8585.02]  So we were just playing for fun and I hurt my back.
[8585.60 --> 8589.66]  And that was like in a lot of pain for a week or two.
[8590.02 --> 8592.04]  Like that was when I was telling you I couldn't sneeze.
[8592.04 --> 8593.96]  Like sneezing was like incapacitating.
[8594.06 --> 8594.78]  I like pulled something.
[8594.86 --> 8595.66]  I also got tennis double.
[8595.72 --> 8597.34]  I shouldn't have played that last for fun game.
[8597.56 --> 8599.84]  It was really close up until I was like,
[8600.10 --> 8600.32]  guys,
[8600.34 --> 8600.66]  I'm done.
[8601.08 --> 8603.68]  I can't go like a little bit messed up still at that time.
[8604.00 --> 8604.18]  Yeah.
[8604.18 --> 8604.84]  I had to wear a brace,
[8605.02 --> 8606.44]  but it didn't bother me during the tournament.
[8606.44 --> 8606.96]  Okay.
[8607.20 --> 8607.56]  But no,
[8607.62 --> 8609.72]  I was like three different parts of your body.
[8609.82 --> 8610.68]  Very injured.
[8610.90 --> 8611.08]  Yeah.
[8611.32 --> 8611.72]  Um,
[8612.40 --> 8613.14]  not awesome.
[8613.32 --> 8613.54]  Yeah.
[8614.20 --> 8615.28]  And yeah.
[8615.42 --> 8615.90]  Oh man.
[8615.98 --> 8616.84]  And to be clear,
[8616.94 --> 8618.24]  I'm not going to make any excuses.
[8618.36 --> 8618.74]  They won.
[8619.08 --> 8619.42]  You know,
[8619.44 --> 8620.64]  when you retire from the match,
[8620.66 --> 8621.16]  they won.
[8621.24 --> 8626.28]  I'm just saying any match I completed or was not playing someone who,
[8626.62 --> 8626.92]  you know,
[8626.96 --> 8628.86]  it literally is like almost semi pro.
[8629.08 --> 8629.52]  Right.
[8630.28 --> 8631.42]  I performed really well.
[8631.42 --> 8631.66]  So I'm,
[8631.74 --> 8632.52]  I was really happy with that.
[8632.58 --> 8632.74]  Yeah.
[8632.74 --> 8632.94]  Nice.
[8633.74 --> 8633.90]  Yeah.
[8633.90 --> 8635.08]  Pains of getting old,
[8635.18 --> 8635.30]  dude.
[8635.38 --> 8636.10]  I hear that.
[8636.44 --> 8637.32]  A hundred percent.
[8638.24 --> 8638.98]  A hundred percent.
[8639.90 --> 8640.28]  Hey,
[8640.38 --> 8640.70]  DLL.
[8640.74 --> 8641.64]  We never got Luke's answer.
[8642.04 --> 8642.22]  Oh,
[8642.30 --> 8642.48]  we didn't.
[8642.48 --> 8643.24]  What was the question?
[8643.26 --> 8644.38]  Staying motivated for your hobbies.
[8644.90 --> 8645.22]  Oh,
[8645.42 --> 8646.08]  um,
[8648.08 --> 8649.04]  progressive overload,
[8649.22 --> 8650.22]  incremental progression.
[8650.22 --> 8653.54]  I am addicted to those two concepts.
[8655.04 --> 8656.04]  That's pretty much it.
[8656.28 --> 8656.52]  Yeah.
[8656.70 --> 8657.98]  Getting old is going to be hard.
[8658.40 --> 8659.08]  Oh yeah.
[8659.30 --> 8659.78]  I've,
[8659.88 --> 8664.82]  I've had this like crisis moment many times where I'm like the,
[8664.82 --> 8670.16]  the thing that drives me on like everything is getting marginally better all the time.
[8670.40 --> 8672.20]  And when that inverts,
[8672.60 --> 8673.84]  Oh no,
[8674.10 --> 8675.50]  I don't know what's going to happen in my brain.
[8675.84 --> 8676.28]  Well,
[8676.32 --> 8677.50]  you'll have a crisis.
[8677.70 --> 8679.26]  Well set up for this.
[8679.26 --> 8679.66]  Yeah.
[8679.78 --> 8680.62]  Like I have,
[8680.62 --> 8682.50]  I have self reflected.
[8682.88 --> 8684.42]  That's why they call it midlife crisis.
[8684.42 --> 8685.32]  It's not midlife.
[8685.48 --> 8686.28]  Happy fun time.
[8686.86 --> 8687.60]  Fair enough.
[8687.80 --> 8688.06]  I,
[8688.14 --> 8688.50]  I've,
[8688.50 --> 8689.50]  I've been thinking like,
[8689.56 --> 8690.50]  I'm going to have to,
[8690.60 --> 8691.30]  you can buy a Porsche.
[8693.68 --> 8696.24]  I think I'm going to have to try to find like,
[8696.86 --> 8703.38]  like reduction of incremental decline as something to aim for.
[8703.46 --> 8703.82]  Yeah.
[8703.88 --> 8704.40]  And go like,
[8704.46 --> 8704.80]  okay,
[8704.80 --> 8708.82]  looking at the math of like averages of how people tend to decline at this age.
[8708.82 --> 8711.30]  If I can beat that by this amount,
[8711.30 --> 8712.46]  that's my goal.
[8712.56 --> 8712.88]  So yeah,
[8712.88 --> 8715.92]  maybe I'll be slower or,
[8716.06 --> 8718.48]  or lift less or not be as good or scoreless.
[8718.50 --> 8718.92]  Or lower,
[8719.02 --> 8720.30]  whatever the metric is.
[8720.38 --> 8723.68]  But if I can have that be by a lower amount,
[8723.84 --> 8724.84]  it would be expected.
[8724.96 --> 8725.06]  Yeah.
[8725.10 --> 8725.94]  Just set a new benchmark.
[8726.14 --> 8726.34]  Yeah.
[8726.48 --> 8729.10]  I think that's going to be the benchmark of like sucking less.
[8729.22 --> 8729.46]  Yeah.
[8730.10 --> 8730.80]  Pretty much.
[8731.28 --> 8732.10]  Let's go.
[8733.48 --> 8734.48]  Competitive aging.
[8736.32 --> 8737.44]  Pretty much.
[8738.32 --> 8738.92]  This is,
[8738.94 --> 8739.60]  this has been my,
[8739.68 --> 8739.84]  like,
[8739.84 --> 8742.06]  I've been planning for this strat for a long time though,
[8742.06 --> 8744.26]  because I'm genuinely very concerned about this.
[8744.26 --> 8746.20]  You can be like that weird Brian Johnson guy.
[8746.60 --> 8747.16]  Oh no.
[8748.50 --> 8751.54]  Cause you basically just described him.
[8751.66 --> 8752.26]  I guess.
[8752.52 --> 8752.62]  Yeah.
[8752.80 --> 8752.98]  Got him.
[8753.64 --> 8755.80]  You're going to take 14,000 pills every day.
[8756.74 --> 8757.18]  Um,
[8757.50 --> 8758.48]  anyways.
[8758.84 --> 8759.00]  Okay.
[8759.84 --> 8760.34]  Hey DLL.
[8760.50 --> 8764.52]  I've seen more people losing access to the user's Steam accounts after being hacked.
[8764.90 --> 8767.08]  I'm terrified of losing all my games.
[8767.52 --> 8770.80]  What's the best way to protect yourself in the all digital future?
[8770.90 --> 8771.92]  Don't click on anything.
[8772.30 --> 8772.60]  Yeah.
[8772.60 --> 8773.32]  Uh,
[8773.50 --> 8775.30]  evidence of ownership.
[8775.70 --> 8776.10]  Um,
[8776.26 --> 8778.32]  have good two set up.
[8778.68 --> 8778.90]  Yeah.
[8778.90 --> 8780.92]  If you can contact support and be like,
[8780.96 --> 8782.52]  this is clearly me,
[8782.58 --> 8784.62]  then you might have a better chance.
[8784.62 --> 8785.14]  I don't know.
[8785.48 --> 8786.06]  I don't know.
[8786.18 --> 8786.34]  Yeah.
[8786.38 --> 8786.96]  So just,
[8787.02 --> 8787.16]  uh,
[8787.16 --> 8789.70]  take a picture of your driver's license and make that your steam profile.
[8790.20 --> 8790.56]  Sorry.
[8790.62 --> 8791.50]  I couldn't even get that out.
[8791.76 --> 8792.64]  Don't do that.
[8792.74 --> 8793.12]  Don't do that.
[8793.92 --> 8794.84]  But it'd be funny.
[8795.00 --> 8795.90]  It would be kind of funny,
[8795.98 --> 8796.22]  but yeah,
[8796.26 --> 8796.44]  make,
[8796.48 --> 8797.08]  make sure you have two,
[8797.16 --> 8797.74]  say two,
[8797.74 --> 8798.36]  a face set up.
[8798.36 --> 8799.32]  Um,
[8799.64 --> 8804.48]  I don't know if steam has a logout on all other systems thing.
[8804.52 --> 8804.86]  Does it?
[8804.90 --> 8805.22]  Do you know?
[8805.82 --> 8806.30]  I think so.
[8806.36 --> 8807.50]  I think if you log out of steam,
[8807.60 --> 8807.72]  it,
[8808.04 --> 8808.40]  I think,
[8808.50 --> 8808.66]  yeah,
[8808.68 --> 8809.64]  I'm pretty sure it does.
[8809.74 --> 8810.72]  Then my other theory won't.
[8810.72 --> 8810.98]  Or no,
[8811.02 --> 8811.80]  if you change your password,
[8812.04 --> 8812.58]  it'll change,
[8812.60 --> 8813.62]  it'll log out of every system.
[8813.74 --> 8814.02]  Okay.
[8814.10 --> 8814.26]  Yeah.
[8814.30 --> 8814.44]  Yeah.
[8814.44 --> 8814.78]  Uh,
[8814.78 --> 8816.48]  someone says SMS is not real to FA.
[8816.58 --> 8816.68]  Yeah.
[8816.72 --> 8817.26]  I have the,
[8817.26 --> 8818.64]  the steam app to FA.
[8818.78 --> 8819.04]  Yeah.
[8819.12 --> 8819.30]  Yeah.
[8819.54 --> 8820.78]  That's been good for a long time.
[8821.06 --> 8821.86]  I mean,
[8821.92 --> 8823.08]  the steam app kind of sucks,
[8823.20 --> 8823.76]  but no,
[8823.94 --> 8825.36]  but the fact that they have,
[8825.50 --> 8825.68]  yes,
[8825.72 --> 8826.52]  but having it is good.
[8826.84 --> 8826.98]  Yeah.
[8828.36 --> 8829.38]  Hello again,
[8829.52 --> 8830.62]  parasocial friends.
[8830.78 --> 8833.24]  I make training videos for the trucking industry,
[8833.62 --> 8834.94]  truck stops to mechanics,
[8835.16 --> 8835.46]  et cetera.
[8835.98 --> 8841.22]  Do you think a strict structure is needed for these or would a more YouTube style approach,
[8841.38 --> 8841.98]  I guess,
[8842.04 --> 8842.60]  be beneficial?
[8843.00 --> 8843.66]  I've caught off.
[8844.16 --> 8844.68]  Depends.
[8844.86 --> 8846.28]  If you're really good at it,
[8846.54 --> 8847.64]  then a conversational,
[8848.02 --> 8850.26]  casual YouTube style approach would be great.
[8850.72 --> 8854.46]  If you really need people to like,
[8854.68 --> 8856.58]  if this is like for certification,
[8856.92 --> 8857.50]  you know,
[8857.50 --> 8860.14]  like if this is something that needs to be covered in a,
[8860.14 --> 8861.48]  in a dot,
[8861.52 --> 8864.16]  all the T's and cross all the eyes kind of way.
[8866.72 --> 8868.66]  You might be able to mix it in that case,
[8868.66 --> 8870.60]  but you're still going to have to get pretty strict structure.
[8870.76 --> 8870.98]  Yep.
[8871.70 --> 8872.06]  Yep.
[8872.06 --> 8872.46]  I agree.
[8872.56 --> 8872.82]  You can,
[8872.88 --> 8875.14]  you can like have fun until you get to the,
[8875.14 --> 8876.44]  the,
[8876.44 --> 8878.50]  the T crossing and I dotting section.
[8878.50 --> 8881.38]  And then you need to be pretty strict for a bit to make it like very,
[8881.54 --> 8883.52]  very clear what the bounds are.
[8883.52 --> 8885.24]  And then you can maybe get back to having fun.
[8887.24 --> 8887.64]  Hey,
[8887.74 --> 8888.24]  LLD,
[8888.62 --> 8892.90]  what greater benefits would emerging content creators get in float plane compared to
[8892.90 --> 8893.36]  Patreon?
[8893.76 --> 8895.06]  Thanks for all y'all do.
[8895.30 --> 8896.52]  You could make less money.
[8896.68 --> 8897.12]  Yeah.
[8897.12 --> 8898.04]  You might like that.
[8898.64 --> 8900.20]  You won't know until you've tried it.
[8901.48 --> 8901.84]  Uh,
[8901.94 --> 8903.88]  float plane is more of a focus on video.
[8904.16 --> 8904.56]  Um,
[8904.56 --> 8907.70]  I haven't looked into what Patreons done for a while on video,
[8907.70 --> 8914.26]  but full plane really is majorly focused on video to the point where it's probably not as good of a solution.
[8914.26 --> 8915.48]  If you're not a video creator.
[8915.48 --> 8915.68]  Yeah.
[8915.76 --> 8916.08]  And,
[8916.08 --> 8918.22]  and if you're an emerging content creator,
[8918.22 --> 8920.24]  that's why I specifically am talking to you.
[8921.02 --> 8921.32]  It's,
[8921.38 --> 8922.20]  it's not for you.
[8922.26 --> 8926.42]  You need to maximize the money that you can get because you need it to eat.
[8926.82 --> 8930.38]  And our revenue split is not going to be conducive to that.
[8930.60 --> 8934.74]  Our platform is designed for extremely high quality video and audio.
[8934.74 --> 8938.20]  And so if you are a large creator and say,
[8938.26 --> 8938.72]  for example,
[8938.72 --> 8942.34]  you were looking to like white label a platform or something like that,
[8942.34 --> 8947.54]  our revenue split is a lot more competitive.
[8947.74 --> 8952.22]  Like if your alternate is hiring a development team and building something,
[8952.48 --> 8952.62]  yeah,
[8952.72 --> 8954.30]  we're going to look stellar.
[8954.58 --> 8954.78]  Yeah.
[8954.86 --> 8960.84]  Whereas if your alternative is like uploading unlisted videos on YouTube or Vimeo or something,
[8960.84 --> 8962.06]  and then just like,
[8962.06 --> 8962.42]  I think,
[8962.42 --> 8962.66]  you know,
[8962.66 --> 8964.10]  sending has their,
[8964.22 --> 8964.76]  has a native.
[8964.98 --> 8965.92]  I think they have a native one.
[8966.18 --> 8966.38]  I'm not certain.
[8966.60 --> 8966.84]  But,
[8967.00 --> 8968.22]  but the point is just like,
[8968.26 --> 8972.38]  if your alternative is finding something free and sending an unlisted link to the people who,
[8972.54 --> 8975.54]  to the several dozen people who follow you at zero overhead,
[8975.54 --> 8976.44]  then you should do that.
[8976.64 --> 8976.96]  You know,
[8977.38 --> 8977.62]  it's,
[8977.70 --> 8978.64]  it's horses for courses.
[8979.00 --> 8979.16]  Yeah.
[8979.16 --> 8979.46]  There's,
[8979.56 --> 8980.56]  there's solutions for,
[8980.66 --> 8981.20]  for everybody.
[8981.94 --> 8983.00]  We like flow plane.
[8983.08 --> 8985.02]  A few other people on the platform seem to really like flow plane.
[8985.18 --> 8987.04]  There's also a lot of benefits to Patreon.
[8987.16 --> 8988.52]  The split is generally better.
[8989.18 --> 8991.30]  But it also entirely depends.
[8991.86 --> 8992.60]  Like if you,
[8992.66 --> 8993.30]  if you set,
[8993.30 --> 8998.06]  if you set your price to the right price on flow plane,
[8998.06 --> 9000.22]  based on how we do our costing,
[9000.48 --> 9002.46]  you can get a better split than there is on Patreon.
[9003.36 --> 9003.76]  Um,
[9004.56 --> 9006.00]  most people won't do that,
[9006.20 --> 9008.38]  but it is possible because we just have,
[9008.60 --> 9009.12]  sorry.
[9009.76 --> 9010.20]  No,
[9010.30 --> 9010.46]  I just,
[9010.54 --> 9010.96]  I had a,
[9010.96 --> 9011.32]  something,
[9011.54 --> 9012.96]  something upside down stuck in my throat.
[9013.20 --> 9013.36]  We,
[9013.46 --> 9013.94]  we have,
[9014.06 --> 9014.30]  uh,
[9014.30 --> 9014.52]  our,
[9014.56 --> 9016.44]  our costs are like fixed for creators.
[9016.70 --> 9017.76]  So if you,
[9017.82 --> 9018.56]  if you balloon,
[9018.56 --> 9020.56]  like if you have a super fancy,
[9020.56 --> 9022.22]  expensive Omega tier,
[9022.70 --> 9023.28]  um,
[9023.40 --> 9029.10]  but it doesn't take any extra from us because we have a limit on our features,
[9029.16 --> 9029.52]  obviously,
[9029.52 --> 9030.30]  um,
[9030.30 --> 9031.50]  then we don't take more.
[9031.50 --> 9033.38]  So you could theoretically take more,
[9033.48 --> 9036.16]  but then you're asking for a lot from your audience at that point.
[9036.24 --> 9037.36]  So most people aren't going to do it.
[9037.52 --> 9037.96]  So yeah.
[9038.10 --> 9039.78]  Unless you have like feet pics on there or something.
[9039.94 --> 9040.20]  I don't know.
[9040.48 --> 9040.80]  True.
[9041.34 --> 9041.96]  We would,
[9042.04 --> 9042.40]  we would,
[9042.60 --> 9042.82]  I,
[9043.04 --> 9043.46]  I,
[9043.46 --> 9046.00]  I don't think we have anything against feet pics technically.
[9046.00 --> 9048.00]  And we don't really discriminate.
[9048.80 --> 9050.00]  It's not a serious conversation.
[9050.26 --> 9051.62]  We don't have to talk about that.
[9051.62 --> 9052.04]  I'm being real,
[9052.16 --> 9052.34]  man.
[9052.66 --> 9052.94]  I'm being,
[9053.00 --> 9053.66]  you don't know.
[9053.86 --> 9054.14]  Maybe,
[9054.34 --> 9054.64]  maybe.
[9054.96 --> 9056.34]  He's trying to sell this Linus.
[9056.46 --> 9057.10]  Maybe the,
[9057.38 --> 9057.98]  maybe the,
[9058.08 --> 9059.30]  what would you call the top crit?
[9059.88 --> 9060.32]  The,
[9060.32 --> 9062.32]  the top foot is watching us.
[9062.82 --> 9066.20]  What would you call the top creator in the feet pics category?
[9067.52 --> 9067.86]  I tell you,
[9067.94 --> 9069.00]  put your foot in your mouth,
[9069.16 --> 9070.88]  but the servers probably couldn't handle it.
[9074.10 --> 9075.50]  The big toe says,
[9075.50 --> 9076.28]  UCR Buffalo.
[9076.28 --> 9076.54]  The big toe!
[9077.48 --> 9080.14]  UCR Buffalo in full clean chat just won it.
[9081.04 --> 9082.28]  You don't know.
[9082.36 --> 9083.66]  Maybe the big toe is watching,
[9083.78 --> 9083.88]  man.
[9083.96 --> 9084.28]  We got to,
[9084.32 --> 9086.72]  we got to make sure they know that they would be welcome here.
[9087.36 --> 9088.00]  Cause we don't,
[9088.04 --> 9088.14]  yeah,
[9088.14 --> 9088.60]  we don't really,
[9088.96 --> 9089.76]  as long as it's legal,
[9089.80 --> 9091.06]  we don't really discern against creators.
[9093.50 --> 9093.90]  Oh,
[9094.58 --> 9094.98]  all right.
[9095.00 --> 9095.48]  Let's see.
[9096.92 --> 9097.14]  Hello,
[9097.30 --> 9097.60]  Dan,
[9097.72 --> 9097.86]  Lin,
[9097.92 --> 9098.40]  and Luke.
[9098.76 --> 9101.30]  What is the average amount of versions of product?
[9101.82 --> 9102.14]  Yeah.
[9102.28 --> 9103.94]  Go through for.
[9104.98 --> 9105.48]  That's all.
[9105.50 --> 9105.84]  Okay.
[9105.96 --> 9107.28]  Product revs in development.
[9107.60 --> 9107.74]  Yeah.
[9107.86 --> 9108.16]  Just,
[9108.28 --> 9108.66]  you got it.
[9108.98 --> 9109.38]  Um,
[9109.52 --> 9110.74]  I think the,
[9111.06 --> 9114.92]  I think the backpack was about half a dozen each for the commuter and the
[9114.92 --> 9115.26]  original.
[9115.78 --> 9116.10]  Um,
[9116.10 --> 9119.54]  we've been told by our suppliers that we go through an obnoxious number of
[9119.54 --> 9123.28]  product revs and it's actually caused some strain on our relationship
[9123.28 --> 9126.42]  sometimes where we'll do half a dozen product revs and just be like,
[9126.48 --> 9126.96]  no,
[9126.98 --> 9127.60]  it's not good enough.
[9127.96 --> 9128.16]  Uh,
[9128.16 --> 9129.06]  they don't like to hear that.
[9129.06 --> 9130.48]  If you don't go to mass production,
[9130.84 --> 9133.72]  essentially they subsidize their sample production.
[9134.36 --> 9134.72]  Um,
[9135.22 --> 9137.68]  with the assumption that you're going to go to mass production,
[9137.68 --> 9138.30]  uh,
[9138.30 --> 9139.10]  from my point of view,
[9139.16 --> 9139.52]  I'm like,
[9139.56 --> 9140.04]  that's stupid.
[9140.04 --> 9142.76]  Then just tell me how much it costs to make a sample and I'll be happy to,
[9143.12 --> 9144.14]  but it's not that simple,
[9144.14 --> 9144.34]  right?
[9144.34 --> 9146.12]  There's an opportunity cost on their side.
[9146.70 --> 9147.14]  Um,
[9147.70 --> 9148.40]  but yeah,
[9148.40 --> 9148.62]  I,
[9148.62 --> 9154.78]  I would say somewhere between four and seven is about where we're at on,
[9154.78 --> 9156.28]  on revisions for products.
[9156.48 --> 9159.90]  Some a lot more like for something like the,
[9160.02 --> 9161.12]  um,
[9161.60 --> 9162.92]  for something like the screwdriver,
[9163.28 --> 9163.74]  you know,
[9163.74 --> 9166.00]  we might go through that many revisions for every part,
[9166.12 --> 9166.78]  right?
[9166.82 --> 9168.28]  That many revisions for the ratchet,
[9168.42 --> 9170.44]  that many revisions for the,
[9170.50 --> 9171.00]  um,
[9171.18 --> 9171.78]  the molds.
[9172.20 --> 9172.68]  And,
[9172.76 --> 9173.36]  and so the,
[9173.36 --> 9176.46]  the overall number of revisions goes up like exponentially,
[9176.46 --> 9177.98]  the more parts there are in a product.
[9177.98 --> 9178.30]  But,
[9178.30 --> 9179.52]  uh,
[9179.52 --> 9180.20]  for socks,
[9180.28 --> 9180.78]  for socks,
[9180.82 --> 9183.26]  I think we're on like 10 or 12 or something like that.
[9183.44 --> 9184.64]  I think we're close though.
[9184.84 --> 9185.74]  I think we're close.
[9186.90 --> 9187.34]  The,
[9187.48 --> 9187.74]  the,
[9187.80 --> 9189.54]  the blue samples that I've,
[9189.64 --> 9190.22]  do I have them on?
[9190.76 --> 9191.44]  I don't.
[9191.54 --> 9194.08]  The blue samples I've been wearing recently are really good.
[9196.84 --> 9197.28]  Hello,
[9197.48 --> 9197.82]  LDL.
[9198.58 --> 9200.70]  What are your thoughts on containerization?
[9201.22 --> 9203.06]  I talk about my interest in it at work.
[9203.06 --> 9205.18]  All my coworkers think it's dumb.
[9205.86 --> 9207.62]  What are some other cool things you guys do with it?
[9207.78 --> 9208.62]  Who thinks it's dumb?
[9209.24 --> 9209.40]  Yeah.
[9209.40 --> 9210.40]  Who are your coworkers?
[9210.70 --> 9210.96]  really?
[9212.08 --> 9212.38]  I don't know.
[9212.38 --> 9214.08]  Your coworkers that you talk to about this,
[9214.24 --> 9216.16]  know what it is and think it's dumb.
[9216.62 --> 9217.36]  I don't really understand.
[9217.56 --> 9219.76]  I don't know anyone in the field that thinks it's dumb.
[9221.62 --> 9222.64]  Genuinely zero people.
[9222.64 --> 9224.18]  So they've never met a single person.
[9224.28 --> 9229.82]  They want the whole system to crash when like monolithic only to the point where,
[9229.92 --> 9230.54]  when I was reading this,
[9230.60 --> 9230.84]  I was like,
[9230.90 --> 9231.08]  wait,
[9231.14 --> 9232.68]  do they mean like physical containers?
[9232.74 --> 9233.24]  Cause I've,
[9233.32 --> 9235.20]  I've never met a single person.
[9235.40 --> 9240.46]  Far be it for me to criticize someone who sent a $120 merch message.
[9240.46 --> 9243.28]  But are you just like baiting us?
[9243.52 --> 9243.56]  Like,
[9243.64 --> 9243.88]  uh,
[9243.88 --> 9245.02]  maybe cause I,
[9245.02 --> 9245.32]  I don't,
[9245.40 --> 9245.72]  I'm not,
[9245.84 --> 9248.20]  I'm not sure if I believe you.
[9248.38 --> 9249.38]  Show this to your coworkers.
[9249.82 --> 9250.10]  Yeah.
[9251.22 --> 9252.46]  What are they talking about?
[9252.58 --> 9254.36]  Maybe they just don't know what it is properly.
[9254.36 --> 9254.90]  Like maybe,
[9254.98 --> 9256.68]  maybe it's more of an education problem.
[9257.40 --> 9257.42]  Yeah.
[9257.44 --> 9260.46]  Maybe they use a different term for it or something.
[9261.10 --> 9261.50]  Um,
[9262.52 --> 9263.04]  it's,
[9263.12 --> 9266.36]  maybe they think you said a bad word and then Aner.
[9267.04 --> 9267.60]  What's the matter?
[9267.80 --> 9268.06]  Okay.
[9268.10 --> 9268.62]  I like it.
[9268.70 --> 9269.16]  What's the matter?
[9269.36 --> 9269.80]  Uh,
[9269.84 --> 9272.82]  in full plane chat said prime and Theo both complain about Kubernetes and Docker.
[9272.94 --> 9273.34]  Yeah,
[9273.34 --> 9273.64]  sure.
[9273.64 --> 9277.90]  But the solutions that they like are as far as my understanding goes,
[9278.00 --> 9282.26]  generally running on systems where the containerization is just detached from them.
[9282.36 --> 9284.04]  It's still happening from the service provider.
[9284.58 --> 9286.66]  They just don't have to deal with it themselves.
[9287.46 --> 9288.66]  Cause they don't want to do infrastructure.
[9288.76 --> 9290.64]  So they just use other services to do it,
[9290.64 --> 9292.24]  which is great and popular.
[9292.64 --> 9293.40]  And like,
[9293.44 --> 9293.72]  I mean,
[9293.82 --> 9296.12]  we use Vercel for,
[9296.40 --> 9297.78]  for the labs website.
[9298.90 --> 9301.06]  Vercel is still doing containerization stuff.
[9301.12 --> 9301.50]  I'm sure.
[9301.66 --> 9302.38]  It's a concept.
[9302.38 --> 9303.16]  It's not a,
[9303.24 --> 9304.28]  it's like,
[9304.64 --> 9305.84]  yeah,
[9305.88 --> 9306.84]  my program is my,
[9306.88 --> 9308.72]  my coworkers think programming is dumb.
[9310.06 --> 9310.72]  And like,
[9310.76 --> 9310.96]  yeah,
[9310.98 --> 9312.04]  it sucks sometimes.
[9312.22 --> 9315.20]  Like I can totally understand why prime and Theo might be like,
[9315.30 --> 9315.42]  yeah,
[9315.42 --> 9315.88]  this sucks.
[9315.88 --> 9320.08]  You shouldn't like waste your time doing this as someone who's just trying to spin up like a website.
[9320.20 --> 9321.46]  You should use like this,
[9321.60 --> 9322.58]  this service thing.
[9322.58 --> 9322.94]  Like,
[9323.00 --> 9323.34]  great.
[9323.78 --> 9324.10]  Um,
[9324.12 --> 9324.36]  yeah,
[9324.36 --> 9328.62]  you probably shouldn't develop your own personal store in 2025.
[9328.62 --> 9329.82]  Uh,
[9329.82 --> 9332.84]  because like Shopify exists and you should just use that.
[9333.24 --> 9333.68]  Um,
[9333.84 --> 9336.48]  that doesn't mean containerization is dumb.
[9337.48 --> 9341.96]  That means that you might not want to be the person who's interfacing with it,
[9341.96 --> 9343.22]  depending on what you're doing.
[9343.82 --> 9344.28]  Um,
[9344.50 --> 9346.70]  we use Kubernetes to great effect with float plane.
[9346.70 --> 9350.50]  that was not the right approach for the labs website.
[9351.50 --> 9351.90]  Um,
[9352.42 --> 9354.78]  cool.
[9355.14 --> 9355.50]  Oh,
[9355.56 --> 9355.78]  dude,
[9356.08 --> 9357.38]  Nick just messaged me.
[9357.46 --> 9360.34]  We have removed the discount messaging for the,
[9360.34 --> 9361.06]  uh,
[9361.06 --> 9363.48]  commuter bag from the Sunday and Monday releases.
[9363.70 --> 9364.06]  Oh,
[9364.10 --> 9364.28]  wow.
[9364.32 --> 9365.72]  He doesn't think they're going to make it that long.
[9365.86 --> 9366.02]  Oh,
[9366.10 --> 9366.34]  wow.
[9367.64 --> 9368.30]  That's crazy.
[9368.36 --> 9369.78]  He says he thinks it's going to be gone tomorrow.
[9369.90 --> 9370.10]  All right.
[9370.18 --> 9370.78]  We'll see.
[9370.94 --> 9371.30]  We'll see.
[9371.30 --> 9372.96]  Obviously I hope he's right.
[9374.56 --> 9375.18]  All right.
[9376.28 --> 9376.72]  LLD.
[9376.98 --> 9381.94]  My work recently banned third and personal monitors citing security concerns,
[9381.94 --> 9385.00]  but always allow personal monitors work from home two days a week.
[9385.32 --> 9385.98]  What do you think?
[9386.48 --> 9388.68]  Same computer office and work from home.
[9389.18 --> 9390.82]  Phones are allowed on site.
[9390.94 --> 9392.48]  Now your coworkers are stupid.
[9394.08 --> 9394.56]  I'm,
[9394.66 --> 9399.44]  I'm assuming this is an IT team currently fighting policy.
[9399.90 --> 9400.10]  Yeah.
[9400.10 --> 9401.68]  You can link them to this video,
[9401.76 --> 9402.26]  by the way.
[9402.62 --> 9402.92]  Um,
[9402.96 --> 9406.72]  you can tell them that Linus says that you made them look stupid.
[9407.72 --> 9408.86]  By laying out,
[9408.94 --> 9410.66]  by laying out their horrible,
[9411.08 --> 9412.50]  horrible policy.
[9412.66 --> 9417.42]  That actually makes me question whether they are competent enough to run any sort of business at all.
[9418.32 --> 9421.22]  Let alone one that uses technology.
[9423.52 --> 9424.62]  Freaking dunked.
[9424.74 --> 9425.64]  Actual idiots.
[9426.06 --> 9426.50]  Um,
[9426.50 --> 9428.82]  that is not how any of that works.
[9428.82 --> 9432.52]  Banned third and personal monitors.
[9432.52 --> 9432.68]  Yeah.
[9432.68 --> 9437.06]  So they can't have a third monitor and they can't bring money and they can't bring a personal monitor.
[9437.20 --> 9437.42]  Okay.
[9437.44 --> 9439.72]  I can understand not wanting people to bring monitors from home.
[9439.72 --> 9441.82]  You're allowed to use your personal monitor at home.
[9441.82 --> 9442.58]  Yeah.
[9442.58 --> 9444.70]  But bringing a personal monitor into the workspace,
[9444.70 --> 9446.02]  I can understand why that might be.
[9446.02 --> 9446.64]  As a liability.
[9446.64 --> 9447.40]  You're allowed to bring a phone.
[9447.60 --> 9448.42]  As a liability,
[9448.60 --> 9449.20]  but not a,
[9449.34 --> 9449.68]  like.
[9449.96 --> 9450.60]  If you're allowed to,
[9450.70 --> 9450.84]  like,
[9450.88 --> 9451.04]  look,
[9451.10 --> 9451.98]  security issue.
[9451.98 --> 9453.04]  You leave this at the office.
[9453.04 --> 9456.08]  I don't let people bring their own lenses and tripods and monitors.
[9456.08 --> 9456.80]  This is what I'm saying.
[9456.80 --> 9457.20]  But,
[9457.24 --> 9457.68]  but it's not,
[9457.68 --> 9458.48]  it's not even liability.
[9458.48 --> 9459.06]  It's just like,
[9459.08 --> 9460.32]  because that's stupid.
[9460.44 --> 9461.94]  If you need something to do your job,
[9462.02 --> 9463.78]  then the workplace should provide it.
[9463.82 --> 9464.46]  It's that simple.
[9464.70 --> 9464.84]  Yeah.
[9464.94 --> 9465.10]  Right.
[9465.18 --> 9467.32]  But so it's nothing to do with security concerns.
[9467.50 --> 9467.64]  No.
[9467.76 --> 9471.18]  If you are allowed to have your own personal phone with you,
[9471.64 --> 9476.12]  everything else is out the window because that is the easiest vector.
[9476.62 --> 9477.02]  Picture.
[9478.00 --> 9478.38]  Like what?
[9478.46 --> 9479.10]  I'm going to bring a,
[9479.10 --> 9480.50]  I'm going to bring a special,
[9480.70 --> 9484.48]  special secret magic monitor with a Raspi embedded in it.
[9484.52 --> 9489.44]  So I can use a HDMI RF snooping on the cable signal,
[9489.66 --> 9493.50]  beam it to my spy espionage office across the street.
[9495.68 --> 9496.16]  Like,
[9496.26 --> 9496.68]  obviously.
[9497.10 --> 9497.20]  Yeah.
[9497.26 --> 9497.64]  Cause there's,
[9497.64 --> 9501.16]  there's obviously workplaces where that shouldn't be allowed,
[9501.16 --> 9504.66]  but they almost certainly also wouldn't allow you to bring phones in.
[9504.86 --> 9505.16]  Yes.
[9505.40 --> 9505.96]  So like,
[9505.96 --> 9507.80]  yeah,
[9508.04 --> 9510.16]  they said they use the same PC at home.
[9510.28 --> 9510.82]  So laptop.
[9511.24 --> 9511.64]  Okay.
[9513.74 --> 9515.44]  But they're allowed a personal monitor.
[9516.22 --> 9517.18]  So who cares?
[9517.48 --> 9517.62]  Yeah.
[9517.96 --> 9518.46]  Yeah.
[9520.18 --> 9521.72]  If you can have a phone,
[9522.30 --> 9525.80]  you can have essentially your own computer at work.
[9525.92 --> 9527.82]  They just haven't figured it out yet.
[9527.90 --> 9532.00]  Is this like a have your cake and eat it too thing?
[9534.06 --> 9534.58]  What?
[9534.58 --> 9535.86]  Like they,
[9535.98 --> 9538.04]  they don't want to buy people extra monitors,
[9538.04 --> 9542.06]  but they also don't want to be like that workplace that you have to bring your own monitor to.
[9542.16 --> 9542.76]  So they're just like,
[9542.86 --> 9543.52]  you're not allowed.
[9543.52 --> 9544.26]  And also no.
[9545.44 --> 9545.98]  Could be.
[9546.26 --> 9546.50]  Maybe.
[9546.70 --> 9546.88]  Yeah.
[9546.90 --> 9550.00]  This could be one of those things where they're just hiding behind security concerns.
[9550.94 --> 9551.98]  There's no real,
[9551.98 --> 9552.44]  I mean,
[9552.44 --> 9552.84]  okay,
[9552.84 --> 9554.62]  there is real security concerns.
[9554.62 --> 9556.54]  They're just also ignoring all the other bigger,
[9556.66 --> 9557.32]  more obvious ones.
[9557.32 --> 9558.52]  I think that if they're,
[9558.68 --> 9559.96]  if they want to be honest,
[9559.96 --> 9561.18]  they should just say no,
[9561.26 --> 9564.30]  because if other people see you with a third monitor,
[9564.50 --> 9569.28]  they won't ask you if you brought it from home and they're going to whine and complain until they get a third monitor.
[9569.28 --> 9570.44]  And that's not in the budget.
[9570.44 --> 9573.14]  Everyone gets two monitors and I just don't feel like dealing with it.
[9573.66 --> 9575.02]  That's the more honest answer.
[9575.16 --> 9575.52]  Probably.
[9575.90 --> 9576.04]  Yeah.
[9576.56 --> 9577.86]  Almost always.
[9578.34 --> 9583.70]  There is the reason why you can't have something nice is because someone else it up.
[9583.90 --> 9584.38]  Oh yeah.
[9584.58 --> 9585.56]  Almost always.
[9586.06 --> 9586.30]  Yeah.
[9586.30 --> 9586.44]  Yeah.
[9586.44 --> 9586.58]  Yeah.
[9586.58 --> 9586.74]  Yeah.
[9586.74 --> 9586.92]  Yeah.
[9586.92 --> 9589.36]  It's always so frustrating or,
[9589.36 --> 9591.92]  or your workplace is a bunch of cheap buttheads.
[9592.52 --> 9597.92]  It's super frustrating when you're on the like administration side of that and you see it happening and you're like,
[9598.00 --> 9598.18]  man,
[9598.22 --> 9601.04]  I really wish this person would stop because if they don't stop,
[9601.08 --> 9602.74]  I'm going to have to do something about this.
[9602.82 --> 9603.02]  Yeah.
[9603.02 --> 9608.44]  But this has worked fine for years and years and years because no one's pushed it past this limit.
[9608.56 --> 9611.18]  And then you like try to get them to stop and they just won't.
[9611.24 --> 9612.32]  And then you have to kill it for everybody.
[9612.38 --> 9613.94]  And it just sucks.
[9613.94 --> 9619.82]  I remember having like tough conversations with you about stuff that we like can't do anymore.
[9619.92 --> 9620.20]  And you're like,
[9620.24 --> 9620.34]  well,
[9620.34 --> 9620.86]  that's stupid.
[9621.28 --> 9621.40]  Yeah.
[9621.50 --> 9621.76]  I'm like,
[9622.28 --> 9623.14]  trust me.
[9623.58 --> 9626.54]  I know how stupid it is more than you ever will.
[9626.76 --> 9627.04]  Yeah.
[9627.66 --> 9628.10]  Yeah.
[9628.54 --> 9629.26]  It's frustrating.
[9629.28 --> 9630.56]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[9630.64 --> 9631.22]  It's frustrating.
[9631.60 --> 9632.26]  Because like there,
[9632.38 --> 9632.66]  you can,
[9632.76 --> 9636.18]  you can interact in good faith in a certain way,
[9636.24 --> 9643.80]  but you have to be careful about it because other people might see it and then interact with that thing in bad faith.
[9643.80 --> 9645.40]  And then it gets turned off for everybody.
[9645.58 --> 9647.54]  And it's happened a bunch of times.
[9647.54 --> 9647.86]  I can,
[9648.10 --> 9651.64]  I know I cannot give you examples for reasons that I hope would be obvious.
[9652.02 --> 9652.10]  Oh,
[9652.30 --> 9653.16]  here's a good one.
[9653.26 --> 9654.36]  Good comment from chronified.
[9654.84 --> 9658.48]  I'd be willing to bet they're using monitoring software and it has a two monitor limit.
[9658.66 --> 9659.78]  So for the work from home setup,
[9659.84 --> 9661.46]  it's a laptop with only one display out.
[9661.64 --> 9662.68]  That's a good hypothesis.
[9662.90 --> 9663.40]  I like it.
[9663.40 --> 9664.80]  I like it.
[9665.92 --> 9666.40]  I mean,
[9666.44 --> 9669.74]  the fact that you have your phone still is like stupid or whatever.
[9669.92 --> 9671.20]  It says personal sighting certificate,
[9671.46 --> 9674.50]  but allows personal monitors work from home two days a week.
[9675.54 --> 9678.08]  I might have a way of doing more than one display.
[9682.54 --> 9682.90]  Okay.
[9683.26 --> 9683.78]  I don't know.
[9684.58 --> 9685.64]  That is interesting though.
[9685.64 --> 9688.80]  Why are you so popular today?
[9689.74 --> 9690.38]  I don't know.
[9690.54 --> 9691.24]  He's so popular.
[9692.92 --> 9693.56]  All right.
[9693.76 --> 9694.20]  Hit me down.
[9694.82 --> 9695.02]  Sure.
[9695.56 --> 9697.44]  I was just waiting for the interruption to stop.
[9698.84 --> 9699.52]  Hi Linus.
[9699.74 --> 9702.54]  Hi Linus and Luke.
[9703.54 --> 9709.32]  I would like to game single co-op games from my PC to my living room TV.
[9709.76 --> 9711.66]  There are around 60 feet apart.
[9711.94 --> 9712.98]  How would you guys solve this?
[9712.98 --> 9721.46]  Optical HDMI cable and probably a USB over Ethernet adapter.
[9721.66 --> 9725.08]  We showed USB two ones that are cheap,
[9725.22 --> 9725.84]  like 10,
[9725.96 --> 9728.58]  15 bucks cheap that can easily do that distance.
[9729.66 --> 9730.10]  That's,
[9730.18 --> 9732.00]  that would be the highest fidelity way.
[9732.46 --> 9733.58]  The low fidelity,
[9734.04 --> 9739.38]  but probably easier way with less wiring would be to just use streaming.
[9739.56 --> 9742.96]  So you have a thin client and just use like steam in home streaming.
[9742.98 --> 9746.06]  Or whatever they've rebranded it to steam link or whatever they call it now.
[9748.00 --> 9751.74]  What tech were you most sad to see flop or fall out of fashion?
[9751.94 --> 9756.26]  I really wish phones with physical keyboards were still improved and made mainstream.
[9757.20 --> 9757.62]  Hold on.
[9757.68 --> 9758.34]  Before we move on,
[9758.42 --> 9759.34]  UCR Buffalo says,
[9759.52 --> 9761.50]  why not HDMI to Ethernet adapters too?
[9761.88 --> 9763.56]  Because by the time you do that,
[9763.56 --> 9767.06]  you've added all of the cost and complexity of an optical cable,
[9767.46 --> 9768.90]  except you're paying for copper now.
[9769.94 --> 9771.76]  Fiber is actually cheaper by the foot.
[9772.32 --> 9774.72]  It's just the media conversion that's expensive.
[9774.90 --> 9776.36]  So if you're going to have media conversion,
[9776.72 --> 9777.40]  a lot of the time,
[9777.50 --> 9779.62]  unless you need to be able to service it in the field,
[9779.70 --> 9781.70]  like if you're doing live events or something like that,
[9781.70 --> 9785.44]  there's no reason to use like,
[9785.44 --> 9788.60]  like HDMI over Ethernet instead of just HDMI over fiber.
[9791.32 --> 9791.88]  Also,
[9792.04 --> 9796.10]  a lot of the HDMI over Ethernet stuff is not like 4K 120,
[9796.46 --> 9801.62]  whereas you can get fiber optic HDMI cables that will allow you to do the full HDMI 2.1.
[9801.62 --> 9803.86]  No,
[9803.98 --> 9806.04]  not any leg difference that I'm aware of.
[9806.08 --> 9806.58]  It's just,
[9806.92 --> 9809.78]  it just doesn't make sense like in the home.
[9810.68 --> 9810.94]  Okay.
[9811.04 --> 9811.32]  Sorry.
[9811.74 --> 9813.96]  What were you most sad to see flop or fall out of fashion?
[9814.10 --> 9814.28]  I mean,
[9814.56 --> 9815.58]  3D is on my mind.
[9815.66 --> 9816.32]  So I'm going to go,
[9816.40 --> 9817.24]  I'm going to go with that.
[9817.30 --> 9818.10]  I'm going to go with that.
[9818.10 --> 9819.98]  Cause I've seen some glasses free 3D.
[9820.08 --> 9820.80]  That's like really good.
[9820.84 --> 9821.76]  Like we could have gotten there.
[9821.82 --> 9822.14]  We just,
[9822.86 --> 9824.26]  the content's not there anymore.
[9824.56 --> 9827.36]  This person said physical keyboards on phones.
[9827.48 --> 9828.52]  I don't agree with that,
[9828.52 --> 9834.38]  but I do agree with physical key inputs practically everywhere else.
[9835.10 --> 9836.84]  There are some good solutions.
[9836.84 --> 9839.30]  Like I'm assuming the one in your car is all right.
[9839.66 --> 9840.14]  It's okay.
[9840.32 --> 9843.56]  But actually almost everything else is trash,
[9843.66 --> 9845.76]  especially a lot of public things,
[9845.88 --> 9848.14]  public things that are touchscreen.
[9848.34 --> 9848.72]  Just like,
[9848.88 --> 9850.08]  I don't like touching them.
[9850.46 --> 9850.64]  No.
[9850.76 --> 9855.58]  And occasionally you get ones that have like good rejection and I can't use my
[9855.58 --> 9856.18]  knuckle on them.
[9856.18 --> 9858.56]  Cause I don't want to touch them with my fingertips.
[9858.90 --> 9859.06]  Yeah.
[9859.14 --> 9861.86]  Like I was a germaphobe before it got cool in 2020.
[9862.28 --> 9863.74]  I don't like touching things.
[9863.78 --> 9864.92]  I don't like shaking hands.
[9864.98 --> 9869.50]  Like one year I stopped shaking hands at CES and immediately I stopped getting
[9869.50 --> 9870.26]  trade show illness.
[9870.40 --> 9870.48]  Yeah.
[9870.54 --> 9871.38]  I do the same thing now.
[9871.54 --> 9871.76]  Okay.
[9871.82 --> 9872.12]  Brilliant.
[9872.60 --> 9873.00]  Um,
[9873.18 --> 9873.34]  I,
[9873.42 --> 9873.64]  I,
[9873.82 --> 9877.06]  you used to be able to press physical buttons with like your keys or
[9877.06 --> 9877.46]  something.
[9878.14 --> 9878.54]  Yeah.
[9878.74 --> 9879.10]  And now,
[9879.18 --> 9882.42]  now you have to touchscreen and tons of them are terrible.
[9882.68 --> 9885.08]  So you have to do the input like a billion times.
[9885.08 --> 9885.26]  Oh,
[9885.34 --> 9885.60]  I know.
[9885.60 --> 9890.34]  And one of the nice things about physical keys is that they almost always do
[9890.34 --> 9891.26]  actually work.
[9891.38 --> 9891.60]  Yeah.
[9892.00 --> 9893.34]  And with touchscreen keys,
[9893.48 --> 9898.34]  it's often not a very good indicator of if it actually worked or not.
[9898.56 --> 9899.46]  So you sit there.
[9899.46 --> 9899.80]  It says,
[9899.88 --> 9900.10]  touch,
[9900.10 --> 9900.42]  touch,
[9900.42 --> 9900.64]  touch,
[9900.64 --> 9900.90]  touch,
[9900.90 --> 9901.14]  touch.
[9901.26 --> 9901.68]  Oh my God.
[9901.68 --> 9901.80]  Okay.
[9901.80 --> 9905.16]  That's going to defeat the purpose of using my knuckles in the first place
[9905.16 --> 9905.62]  for things.
[9905.78 --> 9906.70]  You could spit on it.
[9906.76 --> 9907.70]  You could hawk to it.
[9908.24 --> 9908.64]  Um,
[9910.12 --> 9910.48]  hawk,
[9910.54 --> 9910.90]  touch it.
[9910.96 --> 9912.44]  There's a reference that makes me old,
[9912.50 --> 9912.78]  I guess,
[9912.84 --> 9913.22]  probably.
[9913.46 --> 9913.68]  Yeah.
[9913.68 --> 9914.40]  That's out of fashion.
[9914.70 --> 9915.04]  Very slow.
[9915.72 --> 9916.12]  Uh,
[9916.84 --> 9917.24]  anyways.
[9917.34 --> 9917.58]  Yeah.
[9917.60 --> 9918.88]  Physical buttons on,
[9919.06 --> 9921.30]  on random things.
[9921.60 --> 9923.10]  I think high end touchscreens,
[9923.22 --> 9923.70]  having physical,
[9923.92 --> 9925.52]  having touchscreen buttons is fine.
[9925.56 --> 9926.46]  So phones is fine.
[9926.74 --> 9928.48]  There's probably some cars that are fine,
[9928.48 --> 9930.30]  but there's also some cars where it's terrible.
[9930.96 --> 9931.40]  Um,
[9931.70 --> 9932.60]  but in general,
[9932.60 --> 9934.14]  just like physical buttons would be better.
[9935.86 --> 9936.30]  Yeah.
[9938.90 --> 9940.30]  Japan does this super well,
[9940.38 --> 9940.86]  by the way,
[9940.86 --> 9943.40]  a lot of their stuff is still physical buttons.
[9943.52 --> 9944.02]  And it's very nice.
[9945.16 --> 9948.26]  I still think their train ticket kiosks could be improved.
[9948.56 --> 9949.26]  I agree.
[9950.46 --> 9951.72]  Regardless of button type,
[9951.80 --> 9953.92]  but I like the buttons.
[9955.40 --> 9959.30]  I'm working my dream job at a big tech data center.
[9959.56 --> 9959.74]  Nice.
[9959.84 --> 9961.26]  The work is fulfilling and amazing,
[9961.26 --> 9965.10]  but there are moral implications to working for a major tech company.
[9965.10 --> 9965.32]  Oh,
[9965.32 --> 9966.00]  so he works for Amazon.
[9966.00 --> 9969.92]  Do you have advice for my moral conflict?
[9970.58 --> 9972.32]  There's lots of other data centers you could work at.
[9973.14 --> 9973.66]  Also,
[9973.96 --> 9974.46]  um,
[9976.24 --> 9977.02]  it could be worse.
[9977.18 --> 9980.88]  You could work for an evil company like Linus media group who didn't tell
[9980.88 --> 9981.40]  anybody.
[9981.54 --> 9981.84]  True.
[9982.04 --> 9982.76]  About money.
[9985.54 --> 9985.86]  Dry,
[9985.94 --> 9987.18]  dry your tears with money.
[9987.30 --> 9988.04]  That helps.
[9988.14 --> 9989.20]  Some amount of it's like,
[9989.24 --> 9991.04]  you got to survive yourself.
[9991.44 --> 9992.80]  Slash ass.
[9992.80 --> 9995.34]  And a lot of people will put their own,
[9995.90 --> 9997.64]  as I sort of am right now,
[9997.76 --> 9998.26]  we'll put their own.
[9998.26 --> 9998.62]  Making sure.
[9998.82 --> 10000.54]  Making sure y'all are up to speed on that.
[10000.70 --> 10001.14]  On you.
[10001.20 --> 10002.92]  So you have to decide where your line is.
[10003.86 --> 10004.84]  Your line is?
[10005.76 --> 10006.90]  Oh my goodness.
[10007.92 --> 10008.36]  Um,
[10009.84 --> 10010.34]  get it?
[10010.44 --> 10011.38]  Line is Linus.
[10011.52 --> 10011.78]  Anyways.
[10011.90 --> 10012.26]  I get it.
[10012.42 --> 10013.34]  It's just not funny.
[10013.68 --> 10013.88]  Yeah,
[10013.96 --> 10014.24]  fair enough.
[10014.44 --> 10014.84]  No,
[10014.92 --> 10015.02]  no,
[10015.06 --> 10015.36]  I missed,
[10015.42 --> 10015.88]  I missed it.
[10015.88 --> 10016.52]  I missed it.
[10016.58 --> 10017.26]  I didn't do it intentionally.
[10017.54 --> 10018.26]  I was busy waiting for,
[10018.38 --> 10020.46]  I was busy waiting for chat to actually,
[10020.98 --> 10022.74]  for the people that didn't hear the segment,
[10022.80 --> 10024.86]  earlier on the honey stuff to be like,
[10025.18 --> 10025.54]  OMG,
[10025.72 --> 10026.94]  is that what he really said about it?
[10027.08 --> 10027.26]  Yeah.
[10027.72 --> 10029.72]  For those of you who weren't watching earlier,
[10029.72 --> 10030.80]  what we said was,
[10030.98 --> 10031.06]  Hey,
[10031.08 --> 10031.70]  we don't really,
[10031.70 --> 10032.46]  um,
[10033.08 --> 10034.24]  know what you're talking about.
[10034.76 --> 10038.50]  We didn't know almost any of this stuff at the time.
[10038.50 --> 10040.64]  And we dropped the sponsor years ago.
[10040.64 --> 10041.38]  If you're mad,
[10041.58 --> 10042.36]  that's great.
[10042.42 --> 10043.14]  You should be mad.
[10043.72 --> 10044.96]  Be mad at honey.
[10045.28 --> 10046.56]  Be mad at their parent company,
[10046.66 --> 10046.88]  PayPal.
[10047.28 --> 10047.42]  Yeah.
[10048.36 --> 10048.76]  Yeah.
[10048.84 --> 10049.00]  I,
[10049.16 --> 10049.90]  I don't,
[10050.12 --> 10050.26]  there,
[10050.26 --> 10052.78]  there seems to be a perception out there that like what you invest,
[10052.80 --> 10058.90]  in and the job that you have should have zero reflection on you at all.
[10058.98 --> 10060.28]  And I don't completely agree with that.
[10060.44 --> 10064.08]  I understand that sometimes you're in a life situation where like you just
[10064.08 --> 10065.12]  don't have another option.
[10065.12 --> 10068.86]  You don't have the luxury of just like taking a stand.
[10069.18 --> 10069.36]  Yeah.
[10069.48 --> 10069.96]  And that's,
[10070.10 --> 10070.98]  so that's one thing.
[10070.98 --> 10072.68]  And I am not shooting at that at all,
[10072.68 --> 10074.34]  but I will say for myself,
[10074.34 --> 10078.84]  I've had extremely lucrative potential job offers that I have not wanted to
[10078.84 --> 10080.52]  take because of where they were at.
[10080.52 --> 10082.50]  And I didn't take them.
[10084.24 --> 10084.88]  So like,
[10084.96 --> 10086.00]  it's not impossible.
[10086.82 --> 10087.36]  And like,
[10087.44 --> 10087.54]  I,
[10087.54 --> 10088.92]  I must've been awful.
[10089.26 --> 10089.78]  Cause I mean,
[10089.80 --> 10092.08]  you were here and we,
[10092.16 --> 10092.88]  and we didn't,
[10093.10 --> 10094.38]  and we didn't make up any money.
[10096.34 --> 10096.98]  So like,
[10097.00 --> 10097.54]  I don't know.
[10097.78 --> 10098.18]  There's,
[10098.18 --> 10098.22]  there's,
[10098.22 --> 10098.30]  there's,
[10098.30 --> 10098.62]  it's,
[10098.70 --> 10099.24]  it's possible.
[10099.24 --> 10102.26]  I also know people that had very good,
[10102.46 --> 10107.34]  solid jobs and then took a job somewhere that they didn't like the company
[10107.34 --> 10108.76]  and complain about it all the time.
[10108.76 --> 10109.24]  And I'm like,
[10109.30 --> 10111.80]  this is entirely your fault.
[10112.18 --> 10113.22]  Are you just calling me out?
[10114.22 --> 10114.70]  Yeah.
[10115.08 --> 10116.62]  The prime example is Dan.
[10116.62 --> 10118.96]  Have you been reading my blog?
[10121.06 --> 10121.58]  But yeah,
[10121.58 --> 10121.82]  like,
[10121.86 --> 10122.32]  I don't know.
[10122.44 --> 10123.14]  You should,
[10123.26 --> 10125.42]  you should care at least a little bit.
[10125.42 --> 10126.28]  If it's your only option,
[10126.32 --> 10126.92]  it's your only option.
[10126.98 --> 10127.92]  I'm not trying to dig you for that.
[10127.98 --> 10128.26]  You gotta,
[10128.54 --> 10129.54]  you gotta put food on the table,
[10129.54 --> 10131.52]  but you know,
[10131.56 --> 10133.00]  if you have a range of options,
[10133.42 --> 10135.96]  life isn't just about making more and more money.
[10135.96 --> 10137.04]  100% of the time.
[10138.10 --> 10138.88]  In my opinion.
[10139.00 --> 10139.18]  Yes,
[10139.20 --> 10139.56]  it is.
[10139.74 --> 10141.44]  Which is why I never made a video about honey.
[10141.44 --> 10144.10]  Because yeah,
[10144.18 --> 10146.46]  because you had some form of financial gain there,
[10146.46 --> 10146.74]  right?
[10146.98 --> 10147.14]  Yeah,
[10147.20 --> 10147.62]  for sure.
[10147.94 --> 10148.18]  Yeah,
[10148.30 --> 10149.00]  for sure.
[10149.14 --> 10150.96]  It's not that honey was stealing my money.
[10151.16 --> 10152.84]  Losing the AdSense on that video was,
[10152.84 --> 10154.86]  was very financially beneficial to you.
[10154.92 --> 10155.66]  You mean the,
[10155.66 --> 10156.18]  uh,
[10156.26 --> 10157.34]  you mean the affiliate revenue?
[10158.48 --> 10158.72]  No,
[10158.82 --> 10159.02]  on,
[10159.06 --> 10159.50]  on the,
[10159.56 --> 10160.10]  on the,
[10160.10 --> 10160.74]  Oh yeah.
[10161.06 --> 10161.54]  Oh yeah,
[10161.54 --> 10161.98]  for sure.
[10162.12 --> 10162.26]  Yeah.
[10162.34 --> 10162.54]  Yeah.
[10162.54 --> 10167.34]  Not making that money and also not exposing someone who was stealing from me.
[10167.48 --> 10167.80]  Yeah.
[10168.02 --> 10168.24]  Yeah.
[10168.24 --> 10169.70]  That was definitely my motivation.
[10169.94 --> 10170.76]  It really lined your pockets.
[10170.76 --> 10171.78]  You got it.
[10172.00 --> 10172.52]  Dude,
[10172.60 --> 10175.68]  the number of times that I see people be like,
[10176.42 --> 10183.16]  how is it that Linus spent so much money on this,
[10183.72 --> 10186.54]  but he couldn't afford $500 to test something.
[10187.38 --> 10188.64]  They're so close.
[10189.42 --> 10191.50]  They're so close to the answer.
[10192.18 --> 10193.42]  They just need a little nudge.
[10194.20 --> 10194.90]  Oh man.
[10196.78 --> 10198.12]  They're almost there.
[10198.12 --> 10202.08]  It's almost like they're nothing to do with each other.
[10204.10 --> 10204.66]  All right.
[10205.66 --> 10206.32]  Next up.
[10206.56 --> 10207.04]  Hello.
[10207.24 --> 10208.68]  I love being an internet person.
[10208.80 --> 10211.06]  I'm amazed if you haven't just lost it.
[10213.20 --> 10214.32]  You don't know that he has.
[10217.46 --> 10219.24]  These are crazy eyes.
[10219.24 --> 10222.70]  He hides it well on camera at least.
[10223.42 --> 10224.50]  Hello from the method.
[10224.72 --> 10225.74]  But I beat him off camera.
[10226.80 --> 10227.72]  Watch him cower.
[10228.40 --> 10229.44]  Where the hell's Dan?
[10230.84 --> 10231.92]  This is me cowering.
[10231.96 --> 10233.04]  I don't know why it's pointing over there.
[10233.52 --> 10234.70]  Why is it so dark?
[10234.92 --> 10236.66]  You have let me down for the last time,
[10236.76 --> 10237.06]  Dan.
[10237.64 --> 10239.22]  Pointing the camera in the wrong place.
[10239.60 --> 10241.18]  Don't make me throw things at you again.
[10241.86 --> 10243.22]  Which I have actually done.
[10243.44 --> 10244.22]  And Luke has.
[10244.36 --> 10244.62]  Yeah.
[10244.98 --> 10247.38]  Yeah, Luke actually almost hit him that one time.
[10247.56 --> 10247.86]  Did I?
[10248.08 --> 10248.78]  I think so.
[10248.88 --> 10249.10]  Yeah.
[10249.36 --> 10250.04]  Oh, nice.
[10250.72 --> 10252.74]  You threw an entire CPU cooler at me once.
[10252.74 --> 10253.40]  You probably had it coming.
[10253.60 --> 10253.80]  Me?
[10253.96 --> 10254.28]  Yeah.
[10254.52 --> 10255.22]  I actually did.
[10255.34 --> 10256.68]  When Luke threw something at it,
[10256.72 --> 10258.06]  that was actually extremely warranted.
[10258.12 --> 10258.44]  So yeah.
[10260.58 --> 10261.76]  I think I apologized.
[10262.16 --> 10264.22]  Is it victim blaming if the victim blames themselves?
[10264.38 --> 10265.04]  I think so.
[10265.26 --> 10266.78]  No, that was actually...
[10266.78 --> 10268.06]  Is that Stockholm Syndrome or something?
[10268.06 --> 10268.64]  Not okay.
[10268.96 --> 10270.54]  The other times have been unwarranted.
[10270.70 --> 10272.58]  That one was like...
[10272.58 --> 10273.64]  And to be fair,
[10273.70 --> 10275.66]  I threw like a small little coaster.
[10276.40 --> 10276.56]  Yes.
[10276.84 --> 10277.32]  That's right.
[10277.46 --> 10277.58]  Yeah.
[10277.92 --> 10278.06]  Yeah.
[10279.16 --> 10281.20]  Hello from the Netherlands to Linus.
[10281.40 --> 10284.36]  Do you have any motorcycle specific tech you love?
[10284.56 --> 10285.00]  If I may,
[10285.10 --> 10286.14]  what bike do you ride?
[10286.48 --> 10288.02]  I have an SV650S.
[10288.12 --> 10289.04]  It's a 2003.
[10290.04 --> 10291.20]  But what bike I ride?
[10291.80 --> 10292.38]  Well, none.
[10292.56 --> 10293.56]  Because it's in pieces.
[10294.10 --> 10295.60]  It has been for two years.
[10296.60 --> 10297.98]  I'm going to do it this time.
[10297.98 --> 10298.70]  And I'm going to do it this time.
[10298.70 --> 10299.56]  Do you think it's going to be rusty?
[10300.24 --> 10300.86]  No, I'll be fine.
[10301.48 --> 10301.64]  Yeah.
[10301.64 --> 10302.76]  I took a long time off before.
[10302.88 --> 10303.62]  And it's like, whatever.
[10303.96 --> 10304.92]  It's like...
[10304.92 --> 10305.86]  Riding a bike.
[10308.36 --> 10310.52]  I don't really have any motorcycle specific tech.
[10310.52 --> 10314.46]  I use a pebble for track changing.
[10314.58 --> 10315.52]  Because it has...
[10315.52 --> 10316.46]  Physical buttons.
[10316.62 --> 10317.10]  Sure does.
[10317.26 --> 10318.10]  And you've got gloves on.
[10318.16 --> 10318.40]  Okay.
[10319.20 --> 10319.86]  Makes sense.
[10320.70 --> 10322.04]  Time and place for physical buttons.
[10322.24 --> 10323.98]  And on the motorbike is definitely one of them.
[10324.18 --> 10324.36]  Yeah.
[10325.34 --> 10326.20]  Oh, no.
[10327.20 --> 10327.22]  Oh, no.
[10327.98 --> 10328.70]  What?
[10328.70 --> 10328.74]  What?
[10329.02 --> 10331.56]  Did we both click archive at exactly the same time?
[10331.64 --> 10331.76]  Yes.
[10332.06 --> 10332.94]  And accidentally archive two cards?
[10333.74 --> 10334.14]  Nice.
[10335.34 --> 10335.74]  Nice.
[10337.20 --> 10337.90]  It's so weird.
[10337.96 --> 10338.94]  My chat's not updating.
[10339.70 --> 10343.20]  So I missed everything that chat had to say.
[10344.20 --> 10344.78]  Oh, well.
[10345.04 --> 10345.46]  I'll live.
[10348.70 --> 10349.70]  Just give me a sec here.
[10349.74 --> 10350.54]  Let me see if I can find it.
[10350.72 --> 10351.24]  No, I won't.
[10351.24 --> 10356.08]  Anonymous asks, Linus, what was your favorite game server or community back when you were
[10356.08 --> 10356.46]  younger?
[10357.22 --> 10359.28]  What's your favorite memory from there?
[10360.08 --> 10363.34]  Well, I mean, it's got to be the NCIX gaming server.
[10363.76 --> 10364.70]  Shout out Death Hawk.
[10365.48 --> 10366.28]  You know who you are.
[10366.28 --> 10367.28]  Okay.
[10367.76 --> 10370.62]  For me, I'm going to answer this anyways, even though I wasn't asked.
[10370.74 --> 10371.44]  Playing that Left 4 Dead.
[10371.66 --> 10372.68]  Playing that TF2.
[10373.00 --> 10373.52]  Let's go.
[10373.84 --> 10374.76]  No lifing it.
[10375.10 --> 10375.98]  I think it was Halo 2.
[10377.64 --> 10378.10]  Oh, yeah.
[10378.26 --> 10382.78]  I used to play a bunch with some dude named Utah Crusher, which I've never been able to
[10382.78 --> 10383.36]  find again.
[10385.94 --> 10386.30]  Sorry.
[10386.44 --> 10387.04]  That's pretty good.
[10387.70 --> 10390.74]  But we used to, yeah, I used to be a part of a community on there.
[10390.90 --> 10394.74]  It was mostly myself and Utah Crusher, but there was some other people involved as well
[10394.74 --> 10396.48]  where we would just try to glitch everything.
[10396.58 --> 10397.70]  We'd try to glitch out of maps.
[10399.08 --> 10403.60]  We figured out that the rocket to sword switch thing, I think that was literally us.
[10403.90 --> 10404.32]  That's cool.
[10405.16 --> 10408.14]  And there was a bunch of other cool things too.
[10408.14 --> 10411.04]  Whatever the name of the map was, it was really, really small.
[10411.26 --> 10412.20]  It was a covenant ship.
[10412.48 --> 10412.72]  Linus.
[10412.72 --> 10413.48]  There was a floating platform.
[10414.74 --> 10415.30]  Linus map.
[10415.30 --> 10417.38]  A floating platform in the middle.
[10418.68 --> 10419.64]  The platform's a penis.
[10420.10 --> 10421.06]  It's really small.
[10422.46 --> 10424.70]  Have you just, you've been spending too much time in this pool.
[10425.10 --> 10426.44]  I've been spending too little time sleeping.
[10427.22 --> 10428.42]  I think that's it.
[10429.42 --> 10436.24]  And we spent way too much time, because we were kids, but getting these containers to
[10436.24 --> 10439.82]  go all the way up the ramps to where the floating platform was, and we had to time it perfectly
[10439.82 --> 10440.76]  and we screwed it up a few times.
[10440.90 --> 10442.94]  So you're saying you put a box on the penis?
[10443.72 --> 10444.26]  Kind of.
[10444.68 --> 10445.02]  Nice.
[10445.30 --> 10445.52]  Yeah.
[10445.62 --> 10446.14]  Two boxes.
[10446.30 --> 10446.76]  Two boxes.
[10446.84 --> 10447.08]  Wow.
[10447.24 --> 10447.48]  Yeah.
[10448.24 --> 10448.84]  Same time.
[10449.54 --> 10453.44]  That was actually the whole, that was a very important part of the equation.
[10453.94 --> 10454.86]  What's the physics of this?
[10454.92 --> 10455.52]  It sounds painful.
[10455.66 --> 10456.00]  It's tough.
[10456.84 --> 10457.16]  Difficult.
[10457.24 --> 10457.40]  Okay.
[10457.42 --> 10457.76]  I'm sorry.
[10457.82 --> 10458.58]  What was the thing?
[10458.68 --> 10459.32]  What does it do?
[10459.32 --> 10462.10]  So we got the boxes all the way up the ramp, and then we had to get them onto the floating
[10462.10 --> 10463.08]  platform at the same time.
[10463.20 --> 10463.32]  Yeah.
[10463.32 --> 10466.54]  And that would slam the floating platform in the ground, which would horrifically glitch
[10466.54 --> 10467.84]  the whole map out, and it was amazing.
[10467.92 --> 10468.94]  We were only able to do it once.
[10469.46 --> 10469.74]  Nice.
[10469.80 --> 10472.38]  We're probably the only people that did it, I'm assuming, because it took forever and it
[10472.38 --> 10473.56]  was really, really stupid.
[10473.66 --> 10473.70]  Oh, yeah.
[10473.70 --> 10477.16]  I forgot about that really fun gaming session you and I had, taking the Warthog places
[10477.16 --> 10477.98]  it wasn't supposed to go.
[10478.02 --> 10478.42]  That was a blast.
[10478.68 --> 10482.58]  That's, that's, everything I love about, I almost just said Flowplane.
[10482.72 --> 10486.08]  Everything I love about Halo is just breaking Halo in horrific ways.
[10486.16 --> 10486.44]  Nice.
[10486.60 --> 10486.78]  Yeah.
[10486.78 --> 10489.42]  Well, there's also the music.
[10489.90 --> 10490.36]  Nice music.
[10490.36 --> 10491.02]  Da da da da.
[10491.36 --> 10492.36]  Music is pretty good.
[10492.38 --> 10492.80]  Da da da da.
[10493.50 --> 10494.08]  Oh, so good.
[10494.10 --> 10494.94]  Care for a diagram?
[10495.22 --> 10499.00]  I could, I could do like a horrible paint drawing, but I really don't think it's worth
[10499.00 --> 10499.18]  it.
[10499.18 --> 10499.50]  Yeah, you could, but you won't.
[10499.60 --> 10499.84]  Yeah.
[10501.72 --> 10502.60]  Did we find it?
[10505.84 --> 10506.20]  What?
[10507.32 --> 10507.68]  Cool.
[10508.06 --> 10509.82]  Well, thanks for tuning into the WAN show.
[10510.22 --> 10510.84]  Find what?
[10511.52 --> 10513.10]  The message we were looking for.
[10513.46 --> 10514.18]  That's the one.
[10514.28 --> 10514.72]  He read it.
[10514.82 --> 10515.60]  He beat me to it.
[10515.82 --> 10516.30]  Oh, what?
[10516.30 --> 10517.52]  That was there on my dashboard.
[10517.68 --> 10518.60]  Yeah, it was there on mine too.
[10519.50 --> 10519.90]  What?
[10522.80 --> 10524.62]  Alright, we'll see you again next week.
[10524.80 --> 10525.82]  Same bad time.
[10526.16 --> 10527.16]  Same bad channel.
[10528.16 --> 10528.52]  Bye.
[10534.02 --> 10535.88]  So this is what gaslighting is.
[10538.38 --> 10539.10]  Well then.
[10539.44 --> 10540.02]  No, it's not.
[10540.86 --> 10541.38]  Damn it.
[10541.56 --> 10542.12]  You're wrong.
[10542.58 --> 10543.22]  There's a leak.
[10544.22 --> 10545.94]  And if you're wrong, you deserved it.
[10546.86 --> 10547.94]  Gaslighting is not real.
[10548.38 --> 10549.02]  It's crazy.
[10549.52 --> 10550.16]  Crazy.
[10550.38 --> 10550.62]  It is.
[10550.66 --> 10551.30]  You made it up.
[10553.64 --> 10554.54]  Oh, man.
[10555.28 --> 10555.36]  I did.
[10555.44 --> 10568.12]  I did.
[10568.34 --> 10568.42]  I did.
[10569.36 --> 10570.22]  I did.
[10570.22 --> 10570.62]  I did.
[10571.18 --> 10571.84]  I did.
[10571.88 --> 10572.08]  I did.
[10572.08 --> 10572.46]  I did.
[10572.68 --> 10573.56]  I did.
[10573.56 --> 10573.74]  I did.
[10573.98 --> 10574.06]  I do.
[10574.14 --> 10575.64]  I did.
