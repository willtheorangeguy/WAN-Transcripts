2 hours...unwatchable without timestamps

24hrs and still no timestamp guy??

[2024-07-27T14:43:10Z] Video: You Can’t Bing Reddit - WAN Show July 26, 2024 
Amazing how the views to comments ratio is insanely high before the timestamps get posted. Nobody's watching more than 3s until they arrive.

In lieu of Noki's absence today, please excuse & allow me to timestamp here, like I used to sometimes before. It may not be as standard, but I have my own timestamping standards.
Let me know of subtopic edits or rewording suggestions & extras, if you find one.

Subtopics _(the indented ones)_ are very contextual from the source topic or the episode itself, so even the subtopics may not be as accurate or accurately timed. As a weekday-ender show, it is recommended to just…go easy, watch the whole thing or the whole of a topic, & enjoy going with the flow of conversation.
