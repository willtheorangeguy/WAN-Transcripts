[0.96 → 6.36] What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show! We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[6.58 → 10.00] I forget what the title of the video is, so I guess I'll leave that one for Luke.
[10.10 → 11.16] You're going to buy a friend or something.
[11.26 → 13.96] Yeah, yeah. I could use a friend right now.
[14.94 → 17.98] And I can buy one and hang it around my neck.
[18.24 → 18.68] Forever.
[19.66 → 20.74] Super weird.
[21.02 → 22.02] I'll always be with you.
[22.68 → 26.38] Oh, this is great news. Remember we said it was going to be a good news WAN show.
[26.38 → 35.00] Well, I've got lots of good news. I can buy friends and online marketplaces are responsible for selling dangerous third-party products.
[36.64 → 39.02] That is so cool! The in-sh**ratification!
[39.02 → 40.22] That's actually awesome.
[40.34 → 45.80] Might be still going, but maybe less than stuff. What else we got today?
[46.04 → 48.64] I'm sure there's going to be some bad sides of that, but we'll talk about it in a second.
[49.04 → 52.58] Can the EU save video games?
[52.58 → 61.32] A few weeks ago, the EU registered Stop Destroying Video Games as a Citizen Initiative, and we'll talk about how that works, how you can maybe help it, things like that later.
[61.90 → 66.30] Also, skill-based matchmaking might just be better?
[68.96 → 70.86] I don't know. I didn't think I liked it.
[70.86 → 90.92] The show is brought to you today by Mans caped!
[91.02 → 93.34] 1Password and Moose End.
[93.34 → 97.76] Not to be confused with Moose End, which would be a moose's rump.
[98.30 → 98.74] Ah, yes.
[98.82 → 101.18] Also, our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[101.18 → 102.26] Which support our rumps.
[103.50 → 104.48] Thank you very much.
[104.48 → 105.94] Thank you for tying that all back together.
[106.44 → 106.96] Professionals.
[107.06 → 108.10] Really appreciate you, Luke.
[109.92 → 110.94] Buy a friend!
[110.94 → 116.70] A new AI company called Friend wants to solve the scourge of loneliness.
[116.70 → 119.16] Get this.
[120.16 → 121.20] With technology.
[123.04 → 126.16] It's a wearable necklace that acts as a companion.
[128.34 → 129.56] Have you seen this, Luke?
[129.64 → 130.26] Have you heard about this?
[130.28 → 131.32] Oh, yeah, I sure have.
[131.32 → 139.54] The wearer can speak or even message the friend device over Bluetooth, and the AI will respond over text.
[139.54 → 146.74] The AI may also listen in and comment on whatever is currently going on in the user's immediate environment.
[147.04 → 151.54] However, any data collected is only stored locally!
[152.46 → 152.56] Hmm.
[153.00 → 155.24] I mean, until they update the TOS, I don't know.
[155.36 → 155.56] Yeah.
[155.68 → 156.16] Or get acquired.
[156.44 → 156.66] Yeah.
[156.80 → 163.32] Unlike the R1, so that's from Rabbit, and the Humane pin, this friend only costs around $100,
[163.88 → 167.52] and requires no cellular connection, as it uses Bluetooth.
[167.52 → 171.72] So at least I don't have to buy a subscription to this friend.
[171.92 → 172.82] Yeah, is there no subscription?
[173.40 → 174.10] I don't know.
[174.16 → 174.78] There might be a subscription.
[174.84 → 175.56] I mean, does it matter?
[176.80 → 181.68] Kind of, because if there isn't a subscription, then it's like almost more of a sign that it is definitely a scam.
[181.68 → 187.64] Dude, this is like if I was telling you, look, there's a cockroach salad company, right?
[187.72 → 190.42] And you're just like, oh, but there's no subscription.
[191.04 → 191.96] Who cares?
[192.62 → 193.86] It doesn't matter.
[194.66 → 195.40] It's irrelevant.
[196.06 → 196.82] What is this?
[198.52 → 199.66] Oh, that's probably one of...
[199.66 → 200.42] Is that coming through?
[200.54 → 203.48] There's a motorbiking trend going around the office.
[203.48 → 204.36] I think it's a lot more.
[204.74 → 206.54] Yeah, they're doing some yard work outside.
[206.64 → 207.06] Either way.
[207.06 → 213.52] The friend company raised $2.5 million from investors, giving them a valuation of...
[213.52 → 215.46] I forget exactly what it was.
[215.76 → 222.16] I think it was somewhere in the neighbourhood of like tens of millions of dollars or something like that.
[222.86 → 223.70] But this is great.
[223.70 → 232.00] The company has reportedly spent $1.8 million of this money on buying the domain friend.com.
[232.00 → 232.56] Hot take?
[234.14 → 235.52] Probably best move they could have done.
[236.78 → 237.14] Really?
[237.14 → 246.94] I don't think you could have possibly, possibly gotten the news out about this device to as many people as they did if they didn't blow $1.8 million on a domain.
[246.94 → 249.58] I mean, it's the only reason I'm talking about it.
[249.68 → 249.90] Yep.
[250.24 → 252.42] And it's the only reason anyone's talking about it.
[252.50 → 253.28] So they're idiots.
[254.44 → 255.44] Like a fox.
[255.72 → 262.24] As far as my understanding goes, they have enthusiastically embraced everyone just trashing them for the domain.
[262.74 → 263.78] And like to spread the news more.
[264.82 → 265.08] Huh.
[265.08 → 267.12] I think it might have literally been like part of the plan.
[268.08 → 268.66] There's no...
[268.66 → 270.24] You can't count on that.
[270.32 → 276.18] There's no way it was part of the plan, but it could be part of a savvy response to what's going on.
[276.20 → 281.64] I mean, the fact that they didn't hide it already, I guess, is...
[281.64 → 286.22] The fact that after buying that domain, outside what they've...
[286.22 → 288.32] Including what they've raised, they had what?
[288.54 → 291.04] $500,000, $700,000 left.
[291.22 → 292.76] They had to make a device.
[294.18 → 294.78] Produce the device.
[294.78 → 295.72] Or maybe just not.
[295.82 → 297.12] I mean, have they actually...
[297.12 → 299.02] Have they done more than show a prototype yet?
[300.56 → 300.96] Hmm.
[301.38 → 302.36] I mean, here, let's have a look.
[302.38 → 302.84] You know what?
[303.22 → 303.66] Screw it.
[303.84 → 305.60] I'm going to buy into it.
[305.84 → 306.20] I'm...
[306.20 → 309.00] No, I think you were vulnerable.
[309.44 → 310.32] There's a difference.
[310.54 → 311.74] Oh my gosh.
[312.64 → 313.88] Friend, not imaginary.
[314.14 → 314.68] Wait, what?
[315.02 → 316.30] No, I think it's imaginary.
[317.08 → 319.40] This looks pretty imaginary to me right now.
[320.16 → 320.56] Digitals.
[320.92 → 323.28] That's a shell with a wire on it.
[323.36 → 324.24] That's not...
[324.24 → 328.38] That looks like the thing Ursula kept Ariel's voice in The Little Mermaid.
[328.48 → 330.08] That's not...
[330.08 → 331.78] Wait, what?
[331.90 → 333.38] This is...
[333.38 → 335.44] Have they shown anything?
[337.52 → 337.98] Talk?
[338.16 → 338.56] Pause?
[338.72 → 339.12] Read?
[339.62 → 341.12] Dan, how bad is our audio?
[341.12 → 342.62] It's probably going to be pretty bad.
[342.62 → 346.98] Okay, do you want to ask them if they need to do that?
[348.10 → 349.36] This has never happened...
[349.36 → 351.38] Why is this happening at 6 p.m. on a Friday?
[351.38 → 352.30] I know, right?
[352.36 → 358.50] It's like, guys, I will personally cover your overtime for you to not do this right now.
[358.50 → 362.16] Anyway, the point is, here's the product, Luke.
[362.48 → 366.72] And I couldn't help noticing, this really doesn't look that much like the one that the guy was wearing.
[367.22 → 368.60] What's included in the box?
[369.36 → 371.64] White case, USB-C charging cable.
[371.64 → 371.80] Can you buy it right now?
[372.10 → 372.80] When does it ship?
[372.86 → 373.80] No, no, it's pre-order.
[373.90 → 374.34] It's pre-order.
[375.14 → 376.46] I see...
[376.46 → 377.20] I...
[377.20 → 377.64] You know what?
[377.68 → 380.18] I think this might just be...
[380.18 → 381.22] I don't know what it is.
[381.84 → 383.96] I actually don't know what it is, Luke.
[384.48 → 385.48] This is...
[385.48 → 386.54] Start shipping...
[386.54 → 388.24] I mean, they're not even close to do.
[388.32 → 389.48] This is four months...
[389.48 → 392.42] This is four to seven months from now.
[393.78 → 399.76] This is basically a Kickstarter, but without even the safety net of Kickstarter's terms.
[400.54 → 401.86] Is there basically any?
[401.86 → 405.16] I mean, no, but...
[405.16 → 406.48] Terms and conditions.
[406.76 → 407.08] Like, what?
[407.86 → 408.24] What?
[408.36 → 409.84] Like, look, you spent...
[409.84 → 411.24] We won't give you your money back.
[411.32 → 411.92] This is great.
[412.12 → 419.96] You spent a fortune on friend.com, but you incorporated your company as Mumbai, Inc.?
[419.96 → 420.66] What even...
[420.66 → 422.06] What even is this?
[423.10 → 424.02] That's interesting.
[425.68 → 430.58] We operate the website, as well as the blah, blah, blah, legal terms collectively, blah, blah, blah,
[430.58 → 433.24] close, confidant for everyday life.
[434.70 → 438.76] We will provide you notice of any scheduled changes intended for 18 years.
[438.96 → 440.76] We recommend you print a copy of these legal...
[440.76 → 442.88] You print a copy of these legal terms for your record.
[444.10 → 444.88] Hold on.
[446.54 → 447.16] Uh-huh.
[447.16 → 449.08] Well, wait.
[449.44 → 451.22] This constitutes a legally binding agreement.
[452.12 → 453.22] Agreement to what?
[453.56 → 454.10] Hold on.
[455.26 → 456.00] There's no...
[456.00 → 457.46] There's nothing to agree to here.
[457.50 → 458.32] Is this just a meme?
[458.90 → 459.92] This has got to be a...
[459.92 → 461.04] This has got to be just a joke.
[461.18 → 462.92] So I found MyTab.ai.
[463.46 → 463.76] Yeah.
[463.92 → 467.80] Which leads to a personal companion thing.
[468.90 → 469.12] Okay.
[469.12 → 470.44] It's like the worst website.
[470.76 → 471.86] There's a pre-order button.
[472.20 → 472.80] You click it.
[472.82 → 473.62] It goes to Stripe checkout.
[473.72 → 474.64] It says no longer taking orders.
[474.64 → 476.70] This looks like the same thing, though.
[476.82 → 478.04] So they pivoted!
[478.66 → 480.82] But it looks like the same product.
[482.94 → 483.42] Interesting.
[483.98 → 484.78] Can we...
[484.78 → 485.94] Is that coming through still, Dan?
[486.66 → 487.10] Okay.
[490.44 → 491.14] This is...
[491.14 → 491.84] This is wild.
[492.70 → 494.80] Is there a plan to talk about Donut Media today?
[494.98 → 495.78] What were we talking about?
[495.78 → 496.22] I don't know.
[496.60 → 499.14] I hadn't planned to talk about Donut Media today.
[499.14 → 503.90] I'm really more interested in the...
[503.90 → 507.66] I'm really more interested in the friend.com mystery
[507.66 → 510.18] because I'm finding it extremely fascinating.
[511.36 → 512.34] James left.
[513.90 → 515.18] Oh, no way!
[515.50 → 515.62] Whoa!
[519.38 → 519.98] Really?
[521.32 → 522.82] Where's the news on that?
[522.82 → 523.82] Okay.
[527.18 → 527.58] Wow.
[527.82 → 529.12] That's huge.
[529.24 → 529.96] Here it is.
[530.74 → 531.92] Goose Auto Works?
[532.44 → 532.84] Wait.
[532.90 → 534.04] This is a month ago, though.
[535.96 → 537.32] I think that's...
[537.32 → 538.08] Why I left Donut.
[538.34 → 538.78] Speed!
[541.16 → 541.82] All right.
[543.00 → 544.26] I'm James, and I'm leaving Donut.
[544.50 → 545.44] He was a super nice guy.
[545.98 → 546.46] I, uh...
[546.46 → 547.50] Goose Auto Works is a different thing.
[547.58 → 547.82] Yeah.
[547.92 → 551.22] I really enjoyed working with the whole team down there.
[551.22 → 553.06] Um...
[553.06 → 554.86] When I went down to collab with Donut,
[556.06 → 557.10] yeah, he seemed super cool.
[557.26 → 558.06] So, uh...
[558.06 → 558.70] Hey, yeah.
[558.72 → 559.96] From everything I know about him,
[560.44 → 561.96] which is that...
[561.96 → 563.98] I think he seemed super cool when I met him,
[564.00 → 564.76] and as far as I know,
[564.84 → 566.30] he hasn't had a Pedro scandal yet.
[567.78 → 569.10] Seems like we should be giving him...
[569.10 → 570.48] A rare thing with YouTubers these days.
[570.50 → 572.40] It just seems like we should be giving him our support,
[572.62 → 572.94] you know?
[572.94 → 573.04] Yeah.
[573.42 → 576.54] Building up the non-zero YouTuber community.
[577.04 → 577.56] Thank you.
[577.56 → 578.04] Uh...
[578.04 → 581.12] Thank you for going above and beyond.
[581.22 → 584.50] What's left of him, I guess?
[592.94 → 594.42] Oh, man.
[596.18 → 601.22] Apparently, there's other friend AI necklaces in development.
[601.56 → 602.06] So here's...
[602.64 → 603.32] Oh, my God.
[603.34 → 604.96] This is called Based Hardware?
[605.80 → 607.44] Or is this the...
[607.44 → 608.10] Wait, what?
[608.24 → 609.06] What am I...
[609.06 → 612.94] Man, he looks like the age of person
[612.94 → 616.28] that would be starting BasedHardware.com.
[616.44 → 618.86] I have no idea what I'm looking at right now.
[618.92 → 620.56] I don't know if this is...
[620.56 → 624.48] If this is a promotional video for this product.
[624.64 → 624.90] Oh, yeah.
[624.96 → 625.44] Okay, look.
[625.56 → 626.66] You can order now.
[627.08 → 627.96] Friend Dev Kit.
[628.18 → 629.06] Only 69...
[629.06 → 629.32] Okay.
[629.94 → 630.58] Come on.
[630.64 → 632.40] There's no way these people aren't Memling.
[632.40 → 635.68] There's no way.
[635.78 → 637.00] This cannot be real.
[639.42 → 640.50] Based Hardware.
[641.02 → 642.82] Pre-order now for $69.
[643.70 → 644.64] Shut up!
[646.64 → 649.84] I just want to know if anyone has, like, ever shipped any of this stuff.
[650.28 → 651.38] No, there's no way.
[651.78 → 653.78] Isn't it just, like, a Bluetooth dongle on a necklace?
[654.62 → 655.58] Essentially, yeah.
[655.58 → 659.54] And unless there's a subscription, there's no way they're going to be able to provide
[659.54 → 663.76] ongoing access to any kind of meaningful large language model running in a data centre
[663.76 → 665.64] somewhere, unless you want to talk to Grok.
[666.00 → 669.60] I feel like Grok's not going to help you out that much if you need a friend, though.
[671.26 → 678.24] It might be based and edgy, but I don't know if it would be ultimately helpful.
[678.24 → 684.28] Anyway, our discussion question here is, is this actually a good way to deal with loneliness?
[685.26 → 685.98] And you know what?
[686.32 → 692.54] As much as this might come across as a bit of a cop-out, I have to confess that I don't
[692.54 → 696.94] necessarily feel that qualified to talk about this.
[697.76 → 704.46] It's been really eye-opening seeing how many people commented on the video earlier this week
[704.46 → 706.84] where I talked about the passing of my sister, Emma.
[706.84 → 710.72] It's been really eye-opening to see how many...
[710.72 → 711.94] And it makes sense, right?
[712.12 → 718.88] Like, every human dies, so every human experiences' loss, right?
[719.96 → 725.20] But it's been incredible to see how much empathy there's been from the community.
[725.48 → 729.98] It's been incredible to hear people's stories, and I have read a lot of them.
[730.02 → 733.18] I can't reply to all of them, but as you guys know, I read a lot of YouTube comments.
[733.18 → 741.28] And it's been incredible sort of reading about people's journey through loss and what it's
[741.28 → 742.58] meant to them, what's helped them.
[742.92 → 747.30] And the really sad ones are the ones where people are talking about not having a support
[747.30 → 751.26] network and urging me to make sure that I'm using mine.
[751.34 → 753.18] And I'll tell you, I have been using mine.
[753.18 → 757.74] I've leaned on my family, my friends, my wife, who is also family.
[757.86 → 763.02] But for some reason, when you say family, a lot of people don't necessarily know that
[763.02 → 763.92] you mean my wife.
[764.14 → 764.28] Yeah.
[764.28 → 765.40] I think bloodline.
[765.72 → 765.90] Yeah.
[766.00 → 766.52] Yeah, exactly.
[766.52 → 773.42] And so I guess what I'm trying to get at here is I don't actually, I don't feel qualified
[773.42 → 776.72] to talk about if this is actually a good way to deal with loneliness.
[777.02 → 782.22] So if anyone in the audience is kind of looking at a product like this and going, you know
[782.22 → 788.50] what, that would actually be really helpful to me, or I could see this being a stepping
[788.50 → 791.44] stone to learning to talk about my feelings better.
[791.44 → 798.92] Like, I kind of want to hear from you guys because I don't know.
[799.18 → 807.12] Like, I wouldn't use this, but I also have the privilege of having the best, like, counsellor
[807.12 → 813.46] slash companion slash friend on the face of the earth, Yvonne.
[813.84 → 815.64] And I also have Luke.
[815.90 → 817.48] I knew who you were talking about the whole time.
[817.64 → 819.54] When you did the lean over gesture, I was like, what are you doing?
[819.58 → 820.56] I was just messing with them.
[820.56 → 821.14] Oh, okay.
[821.44 → 827.42] I do think, I mean, there's a they call it the loneliness epidemic, right?
[827.46 → 828.80] Like, this is a huge thing right now.
[828.80 → 829.66] Yeah, it's totally a thing.
[830.08 → 834.08] People have asked if I remember correctly, the average adult male has 0.5 friends or something.
[834.32 → 837.02] Like, it's less than one is what I remember.
[838.74 → 840.94] And that has got to be kind of rough.
[841.38 → 843.24] A question I would pose for you.
[843.48 → 843.70] Yeah.
[843.76 → 845.06] As you said, I wouldn't use something like this.
[845.08 → 845.82] I have a great companion.
[845.82 → 851.86] If you were stuck in a like, basically like an isolation room.
[851.86 → 855.12] Like, maybe you did one of those, like, Mars experiment things.
[855.18 → 857.24] I would talk to my necklace.
[857.42 → 858.18] Yeah, I think I would, too.
[858.38 → 858.70] I would.
[858.70 → 861.04] And maybe, and maybe you're right.
[861.32 → 863.30] Maybe the answer is as simple as that.
[863.68 → 866.94] If I was isolated enough, would I resort to this?
[867.06 → 868.54] And there's no question.
[868.74 → 871.04] I mean, humans need contact.
[871.42 → 871.56] Yeah.
[871.56 → 878.46] And I think that we would accept fake contact before we would accept no contact and no interaction with anything.
[878.46 → 882.36] If I'm being totally real, if I'm by myself, I already talk to myself a lot.
[882.96 → 883.18] Yeah.
[883.28 → 885.96] So I don't think it's going to be really that different if the thing replies.
[887.24 → 887.64] Yeah.
[887.66 → 891.30] But then what happens when it deflates?
[892.90 → 893.26] Will!
[893.26 → 893.34] Will!
[896.10 → 896.50] Yeah.
[896.60 → 902.68] People, like, if you leave someone alone in a room for long enough, they're going to personify, like, practically anything they can.
[902.98 → 904.86] Because humans just do be like that.
[905.92 → 907.92] I could see people getting use out of it.
[907.92 → 916.54] I think you should really try to not allow it to replace or stop direct human interaction.
[916.86 → 917.10] Yeah.
[917.28 → 922.34] But if there isn't any, I feel like something's probably better than nothing.
[922.34 → 922.64] Yeah.
[922.74 → 928.28] But is this, are we accepting a crutch when what we should have is a splint and a cast?
[928.56 → 935.48] You know, like, are we putting ourselves in a position where we're making the journey ultimately more difficult?
[935.48 → 944.02] By putting this fake interaction into our lives?
[944.02 → 949.10] Avon just commented, and it's probably very true.
[949.22 → 950.72] It just, like, hurts to even read.
[950.88 → 952.96] But he said, abandoned elderly may benefit.
[953.58 → 953.80] Yeah.
[953.90 → 954.90] It's like, yeah, probably.
[955.34 → 955.72] Yep.
[955.72 → 967.02] Because it's one of those situations where, like, if your only social interaction ever is care workers coming in and, like, dropping your food off and leaving immediately because they have 10,000 other things to take care of.
[968.28 → 969.18] Yeah, you might.
[969.48 → 970.90] It just, that sucks.
[971.20 → 973.88] But, like, it's probably real.
[973.88 → 982.92] I think, speaking of things that are probably real and ultimately where we're headed, Long Linus in float plane chat says, can we skip friend and just get to robotic waifs?
[983.80 → 984.78] Yeah, that's coming for sure.
[984.92 → 985.12] Yeah.
[985.30 → 986.42] Well, that's, that's not.
[987.06 → 987.42] Phrasing.
[989.50 → 990.60] I didn't mean it.
[990.76 → 992.46] I didn't, I didn't intend it is what I meant.
[992.56 → 993.06] That's not.
[996.94 → 997.38] Sorry.
[998.10 → 998.54] Sorry.
[998.54 → 1002.76] Okay.
[1003.90 → 1004.26] All right.
[1004.54 → 1004.92] All right.
[1005.08 → 1005.54] All right.
[1005.98 → 1006.02] All right.
[1006.02 → 1006.40] All right.
[1006.40 → 1009.78] What I was trying to say is, that's not coming eventually.
[1010.64 → 1011.94] It's coming right now.
[1015.10 → 1017.96] I mean, you can already, you can already interact with.
[1017.96 → 1018.90] They have versions of it, don't they?
[1019.00 → 1019.52] Yeah, exactly.
[1019.52 → 1019.54] Yeah.
[1019.54 → 1025.54] Like, you can interact with an AI, like, an AI voice of, like, some Twitch streamers and stuff like that.
[1025.54 → 1026.04] Oh, yeah.
[1026.42 → 1026.58] Yeah.
[1026.70 → 1027.96] This is totally a thing.
[1027.96 → 1031.20] It's just a matter of when real dolls are going to integrate it, right?
[1031.28 → 1031.88] Like, it's.
[1032.06 → 1033.62] Some form of collaboration or something.
[1033.66 → 1034.32] Or just do it themselves.
[1034.60 → 1034.78] Yeah.
[1035.86 → 1037.38] It's not the only thing they're going to do themselves.
[1039.96 → 1040.48] Dang it.
[1040.48 → 1041.60] We're going to get them someday.
[1041.94 → 1043.78] Gentlemen, we're 17 minutes into the show.
[1044.66 → 1046.48] We made it past the what is the YouTube thing?
[1046.56 → 1047.06] I don't know.
[1047.06 → 1047.46] Five minutes or something?
[1047.46 → 1049.70] Hey, 17 minutes in is pretty good for me, so.
[1050.96 → 1051.80] It's a new record.
[1053.50 → 1053.90] Oh.
[1055.64 → 1056.46] Oh, no.
[1056.46 → 1058.18] What are we supposed to do?
[1058.54 → 1059.56] But not in age.
[1060.12 → 1061.44] Oh, whoa.
[1063.04 → 1063.74] Next topic?
[1063.84 → 1064.28] Okay.
[1064.50 → 1064.96] Whoa.
[1064.96 → 1066.30] Let's move right on.
[1066.46 → 1068.34] What are our other headline topics today?
[1068.34 → 1069.26] I don't even know what that means.
[1069.34 → 1070.22] I'm just terrified of it.
[1070.22 → 1072.60] Skill-based matchmaking is just plain better.
[1072.60 → 1080.06] In response to discourse condemning skills-based matchmaking, Activision has released a 25-page
[1080.06 → 1086.50] white paper revealing a secret experiment where they massively reduced the impact of skill
[1086.50 → 1090.62] in matchmaking for half of Modern Warfare 3 players in North America.
[1090.62 → 1098.76] According to their results, around 90% of players had lower overall playtime and were more likely
[1098.76 → 1103.82] to quit during matches, with only the most skilled of players being unaffected by the
[1103.82 → 1104.18] change.
[1104.44 → 1105.40] Now, hold on.
[1105.66 → 1111.42] Because I want to back up and say, other than reading the words together in the order they're
[1111.42 → 1116.36] in, I don't actually know exactly what skills-based matchmaking means in this context.
[1116.36 → 1116.76] Yeah.
[1116.76 → 1117.12] I got you.
[1117.20 → 1119.32] And why anybody would be upset about it.
[1119.34 → 1119.58] Sure.
[1119.78 → 1120.12] Hit me.
[1120.24 → 1124.18] So, completely non-skills-based matchmaking.
[1124.28 → 1127.70] It's not really matchmaking, but completely non would just be like pub servers back in
[1127.70 → 1127.96] the day.
[1128.26 → 1129.42] You have a dedicated server list.
[1129.64 → 1131.08] You jump into whatever server is there.
[1131.30 → 1132.34] You're playing with those players.
[1132.80 → 1137.28] A matchmaking version of that would just be filling random lobbies with people automatically,
[1137.28 → 1139.26] but based on nothing.
[1139.66 → 1139.82] Yeah.
[1140.08 → 1140.66] Yeah, exactly.
[1140.80 → 1141.42] First in, first out.
[1141.90 → 1142.06] Sure.
[1142.52 → 1147.10] Skills-based matchmaking would be that you would have some type of MMR, a matchmaking
[1147.10 → 1147.46] ranking.
[1147.58 → 1147.74] Sure.
[1148.28 → 1150.50] And in this case, it would probably be hidden.
[1151.18 → 1154.58] So, you don't necessarily know what your matchmaking ranking is, but it's going to match
[1154.58 → 1157.48] you up with people that are similar to your ranking as best as it can.
[1157.76 → 1157.98] Okay.
[1158.30 → 1159.60] So, then, follow-up question.
[1160.92 → 1166.52] Who the actual donkey f**k thinks that skills-based matchmaking is a bad idea?
[1167.28 → 1169.82] I think, like...
[1169.82 → 1171.16] Like, is this not complete...
[1171.16 → 1172.96] Like, is this controversial?
[1173.22 → 1174.76] Like, is this a hot take?
[1174.76 → 1175.10] There are people...
[1175.10 → 1175.52] There are...
[1175.52 → 1183.24] I don't know if it's a hot take for the actual average person necessarily, but there is definitely
[1183.24 → 1187.84] a loud amount of people that don't like skills-based matchmaking.
[1188.36 → 1188.94] I know that.
[1189.06 → 1190.30] For what reason exactly?
[1190.40 → 1191.48] I don't know necessarily.
[1191.48 → 1193.32] I can think of, like...
[1193.32 → 1195.44] I think it would be maybe hard...
[1195.44 → 1202.24] Unless the matchmaking rank that you have is public, which I know some people don't like
[1202.24 → 1206.08] that because then they feel like they're constantly playing ranked, which you technically are.
[1206.24 → 1206.48] Yeah.
[1206.76 → 1207.84] You just don't know that.
[1207.84 → 1208.16] Uh-huh.
[1208.52 → 1213.44] But unless it's public, to me, a negative feeling that could come from it is that you
[1213.44 → 1217.48] feel like you're constantly on this treadmill of skill, where you never really feel like
[1217.48 → 1220.40] you're getting that much better compared to other people, because the game is constantly
[1220.40 → 1223.98] pairing you with people that are of the same goodness, I guess.
[1223.98 → 1224.20] Right.
[1224.20 → 1230.92] So by their logic, anyone should be allowed to be in the Olympic freestyle swimming finals?
[1231.92 → 1236.30] And if one person happens to be perfect, then like...
[1236.30 → 1238.02] And one person can barely swim?
[1238.18 → 1238.96] That's like...
[1238.96 → 1241.30] Are you entertained by this?
[1241.42 → 1242.28] Like, sorry, what?
[1242.38 → 1249.64] I do think every Olympics should have, like, an army of, like, gym bobs that are just, like,
[1249.70 → 1253.54] average dudes, and they just show them alongside the Olympians to, like, show the gap.
[1253.54 → 1257.08] I would actually, like, I know this is not an original idea.
[1257.36 → 1258.50] People have been saying this for years.
[1258.84 → 1260.18] I would love it if it happened.
[1260.58 → 1264.24] Because, like, you see these people perform, and you're like, that's cool.
[1264.42 → 1264.62] Yeah.
[1264.72 → 1267.98] But, like, maybe this is some sport I've never seen before.
[1268.54 → 1270.80] Or, like, I never really understood the gap.
[1270.88 → 1274.34] Like, you see someone dive, and they have, like, three droplets come out of the water,
[1274.46 → 1275.32] and you're like, I don't...
[1275.32 → 1275.94] Is that good?
[1276.08 → 1278.36] And then you see some, like, random dude just flop.
[1278.96 → 1280.52] It's like a huge wave.
[1280.78 → 1281.74] And you're like, oh, okay.
[1281.74 → 1284.24] So there's actually, like, there's difficulty here.
[1284.36 → 1285.62] I think that would be fantastic.
[1285.78 → 1287.72] But, anyway, I don't really get the argument.
[1287.86 → 1289.04] I prefer Skulls-Based Matchmaking.
[1289.04 → 1289.76] So I don't know.
[1289.76 → 1292.80] And the thing is, honestly speaking, like, I...
[1292.80 → 1294.72] To me, this is so...
[1294.72 → 1297.56] And I'm so sorry if it...
[1297.56 → 1299.82] I sound like such an**hole sometimes.
[1299.98 → 1303.72] Because, well, no, sometimes things just seem really obvious to me.
[1303.72 → 1306.24] And then I say, like, isn't this obvious?
[1306.52 → 1308.52] And then people are like, wow, Linus is mean.
[1308.62 → 1309.32] That wasn't obvious.
[1309.74 → 1316.28] There are things about Skull-Based Matchmaking that makes things less interesting to me personally, for sure.
[1316.42 → 1318.52] But, okay, well, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1318.60 → 1319.82] Let me back up for a second.
[1319.90 → 1320.86] Because, like, I...
[1320.86 → 1321.02] Okay.
[1322.02 → 1322.42] I...
[1322.42 → 1323.02] Maybe...
[1323.02 → 1327.14] And maybe part of it is just my lived experiences that make this obvious to me.
[1327.14 → 1329.78] There's a local badminton tournament.
[1330.08 → 1331.16] It's called Badmintology.
[1331.72 → 1334.68] And they usually do about two to four tournaments a year.
[1335.22 → 1340.40] And that's what I signed up for when I did my very first badminton competition.
[1341.06 → 1342.16] And they had...
[1342.16 → 1342.76] They're gamers.
[1342.98 → 1343.42] They're members.
[1343.62 → 1345.12] It's a young group that runs it.
[1345.26 → 1351.52] And so the way that they divided their brackets was Blue Shell, Red Shell, and Green Shell.
[1351.52 → 1359.08] And the description was Blue Shell is for competitive players at a very high level.
[1359.58 → 1363.42] Like, if you've ever competed provincially or nationally, basically...
[1363.42 → 1364.12] This is Morrow Kart.
[1364.26 → 1365.02] You should be in here.
[1365.20 → 1365.70] Yeah, exactly.
[1366.28 → 1372.52] Red Shell was if you play regularly and compete hard.
[1372.96 → 1378.22] And Green Shell was for if you are just getting into the sport, and you're looking for a friendly competition.
[1378.22 → 1382.42] I signed up for Green Shell because that was a description of me.
[1382.54 → 1384.70] I was playing every week.
[1384.88 → 1388.58] But, you know, I'd only really been doing it for six months, two a year, or something like that.
[1388.64 → 1394.74] I showed up for my first match, got absolutely f***ING shit-wrecked by someone who was sandbagging in a lower tier.
[1395.76 → 1403.72] And I guess for me, what I realized from that experience was that that's not fun.
[1404.86 → 1406.10] I didn't have fun.
[1406.10 → 1408.28] Did they have fun?
[1409.44 → 1412.10] Like, honestly, would...
[1413.14 → 1416.10] Would...
[1416.78 → 1417.56] Okay, here.
[1418.04 → 1419.00] Here's a good example.
[1419.46 → 1425.44] Would Magnus Carlsen have fun, like, destroying my son at chess?
[1425.60 → 1429.76] Have you seen some of his, like, he puts a blindfold on and then plays five people at the same time?
[1429.76 → 1430.80] That's totally different.
[1430.94 → 1431.32] So sick.
[1431.38 → 1431.80] No, I know.
[1431.92 → 1432.22] I know.
[1432.22 → 1438.26] Because I'm talking about in what is supposed to be a level match.
[1438.36 → 1438.92] I'm sure it would be.
[1439.40 → 1443.02] And if he did get some kind of perverse pleasure out of that...
[1443.02 → 1443.52] I doubt it.
[1443.64 → 1446.04] Would we think that that's cool or admirable?
[1446.32 → 1446.58] No.
[1447.34 → 1448.22] Would it be fun for...
[1448.72 → 1449.70] I mean, if he...
[1449.70 → 1455.20] And I'm not talking about him taking the time to give a tutorial on, you know, what he was doing and why.
[1455.20 → 1456.20] And that's...
[1456.20 → 1462.14] I'm talking in competition because we're talking about this in a competitive gaming context, right?
[1462.56 → 1465.18] Where people are competing to win.
[1467.22 → 1473.16] How could anyone look at that and go, yes, that is good and honourable and enjoyable?
[1474.02 → 1478.64] And I have always said, and a lot of this was inspired by my experience in that first tournament,
[1478.74 → 1483.76] where someone who had absolutely no right to be in green shell, but it was self-assessed, right?
[1483.76 → 1487.76] So they just decided that they were going to be green shell because they want a medal, essentially, right?
[1488.76 → 1490.44] Is that medal valuable?
[1490.72 → 1498.98] I mean, we mock participation trophies, but you're basically self-opting into a participation trophy for yourself by, like, competing in the kids league.
[1499.06 → 1500.26] Like, what's wrong with you?
[1500.26 → 1505.04] I think you have some long-term resentment over this particular occasion.
[1505.06 → 1506.84] Well, it's not the resentment.
[1507.08 → 1508.72] It's a desire to fix it.
[1509.14 → 1509.68] No, no, I would just...
[1509.68 → 1520.26] Like, I will tell people all the time, I would rather lose a match 25-23 than win 21-4.
[1520.26 → 1525.28] Yeah, someone tried to bring up Fast Philly said, some people do love that stuff.
[1525.28 → 1526.58] Remember Markov.
[1526.70 → 1530.58] And I don't necessarily think that's true for Markov.
[1530.66 → 1532.00] I understand what you're trying to get at.
[1532.10 → 1534.86] But, like, when I used to play, if you could tell...
[1534.86 → 1538.22] Like, you can see in Markov the level of the person that you took down.
[1539.26 → 1543.08] And if they were a low-level player, I wouldn't necessarily automatically do this.
[1543.48 → 1544.38] But I would...
[1544.38 → 1547.64] If they were a low-level player, I would look at the kit that they brought in and be like,
[1547.64 → 1552.16] is this a low-level player who's played a lot, but just they didn't go super hard this season?
[1552.48 → 1552.62] Yeah.
[1552.68 → 1553.94] Or is this actually a new player?
[1554.06 → 1557.52] And if it was a new player, I'd throw all their stuff in a bush so they'd get it back in insurance.
[1557.52 → 1558.64] Because, like, I actually don't...
[1559.28 → 1561.84] I'm not, like, super proud of that W, you know?
[1561.96 → 1562.20] Yeah.
[1562.36 → 1568.56] But I sometimes think, like, some things that I do like about not skill-based matchmaking...
[1568.56 → 1568.74] Sure.
[1569.02 → 1571.78] ...is, like, if I think about playing TF2 mostly...
[1571.78 → 1573.24] Most of these are going to come from TF2.
[1573.38 → 1573.56] Sure.
[1573.62 → 1577.14] But I think about playing TF2 back in the day, especially with huge lobby games.
[1577.14 → 1582.04] If it's, like, a five versus five, I can't think of many scenarios where I like non-skill-based matchmaking.
[1582.16 → 1585.96] But big lobby games, you'd find, like, the one good person on the other team.
[1586.42 → 1590.14] And even if you weren't doing that well, trying to, like, hunt that person down...
[1591.14 → 1593.54] Had a very deep level of satisfaction to it.
[1593.60 → 1600.26] Like, maybe I'm not doing that great in the game, but if I can impact this game by taking down their star player every once in a while...
[1600.26 → 1600.36] Yeah.
[1600.36 → 1603.52] ...through, like, certain weird type of gameplay, then that's, like, really fun to me.
[1603.52 → 1605.86] I think there are emergent types of gameplay.
[1605.86 → 1611.22] I think there are emergent interactions that happen from mixing pot instead of skill-based matchmaking.
[1611.50 → 1616.30] And I think there's a little bit of forever treadmill that comes from skill-based matchmaking.
[1616.34 → 1616.48] Sure.
[1616.80 → 1618.20] That I think might be result...
[1618.20 → 1625.46] Like, part of this story is that 90% of players had a lower overall playtime when it wasn't skill-based matchmaking.
[1625.60 → 1625.74] Yeah.
[1625.74 → 1630.58] And I don't know, personally, that all of that is just because they enjoyed the game more.
[1631.24 → 1635.20] I would say that as much as I do think skill-based matchmaking is in general better...
[1635.20 → 1635.36] Yeah.
[1635.66 → 1639.74] ... I suspect some of that increased playtime is because of the forever treadmill of...
[1640.40 → 1642.20] ... I'm always slightly behind.
[1642.94 → 1643.20] Sure.
[1643.20 → 1645.06] You never had a game where you were number one.
[1645.32 → 1650.40] You never, like, these things didn't really happen because the game is designed to not really allow that to happen.
[1651.36 → 1651.76] Sure.
[1653.56 → 1654.74] So, I don't know.
[1654.80 → 1657.48] I understand why some people might think it's negative.
[1657.62 → 1657.76] Yeah.
[1657.88 → 1660.20] Personally, I think, overall, it is more positive.
[1660.20 → 1667.24] I do see a lot of people talking about how, like, what if I, you know, just want to relax and play a game for fun without trying too hard?
[1667.56 → 1674.04] And it's like, right, but the issue is that you're playing a competitive game.
[1674.64 → 1680.64] So, the other team, they don't have the luxury of deciding, oh, I'm down.
[1681.00 → 1683.62] I'll just try and win.
[1684.48 → 1686.20] And so, it's not about you.
[1686.20 → 1691.00] It's about everybody having an opportunity to win.
[1692.90 → 1699.06] And that, to me, I mean, that's the very, that's the foundational core of competition.
[1699.50 → 1706.80] If there's, if one side decides who's going to win, would you tune into a sporting event?
[1707.66 → 1708.38] Like, would...
[1708.38 → 1711.58] I think that's why the TF2 examples stand out to me.
[1711.58 → 1711.82] Yeah.
[1712.04 → 1716.14] Because as much as I am definitely regarding, because I sort of do that all the time.
[1716.20 → 1716.54] And everything.
[1717.00 → 1720.98] But in TF2, it is much more of, like, an arcade game.
[1721.40 → 1721.72] Yeah, but in...
[1721.72 → 1722.92] With a huge lobby.
[1723.16 → 1726.64] Because I'm used to, like, 16 versus 16 arcade-style gameplay.
[1726.78 → 1726.96] Yeah.
[1727.12 → 1732.12] And then that's where you're going to get a lot more of those emergent cases where you can, like, headhunt the top players and all this other type of stuff.
[1732.12 → 1732.84] Yeah, and...
[1732.84 → 1739.96] But in TF2, just through the sheer law of numbers, unless people are being complete, you know, jackasses...
[1739.96 → 1740.88] And team stacking.
[1741.30 → 1742.04] Yeah, and...
[1742.04 → 1743.10] It's going to average out a lot better.
[1743.34 → 1743.84] It will...
[1743.84 → 1745.50] The chances of it averaging out...
[1745.50 → 1746.96] It's also a more chaotic game.
[1747.06 → 1747.20] Yeah.
[1747.34 → 1749.62] There is absolutely skill in Team Fortress 2.
[1749.68 → 1749.86] Totally.
[1749.86 → 1758.82] But there's also absolutely stepping on a bomb just because, you know, it was flung across the map.
[1759.00 → 1760.66] Like, it happens, right?
[1760.66 → 1773.22] And so I think that TF2 is an example of a game where as long as people are not maliciously, intentionally stacking the teams, then it's not nearly as much of an issue.
[1773.32 → 1780.76] But honestly, I'm so glad you brought that up because we all know that team stacking is a dick thing to do.
[1781.64 → 1788.98] And essentially, when you argue against skills-based matchmaking, you're saying, well, I should be allowed to be on a stacked team.
[1790.66 → 1792.94] Yeah, I don't feel like it happened that much in TF2, though.
[1793.16 → 1795.84] I think across the board, I don't love it.
[1795.84 → 1798.86] But in certain games, like in COD, it probably does make sense.
[1799.16 → 1799.24] Yeah.
[1799.30 → 1799.50] Yeah.
[1799.62 → 1802.92] I don't think there's a very good argument against skills-based matchmaking in COD.
[1803.06 → 1805.10] But I do think there are other games where it's genuinely fun.
[1805.14 → 1809.74] There's no way that I would play Halo Infinite without skills-based matchmaking.
[1810.02 → 1811.50] It would be a complete waste of time.
[1811.58 → 1819.78] A top-level player is on such a different level that they would just wipe the other team, grab the flag, drop it,
[1819.78 → 1821.80] wipe them when they respawn, and carry it back.
[1821.88 → 1825.04] Like, it's just, it's not, are they having fun?
[1825.12 → 1827.20] And if they are, like, what's wrong with them?
[1827.92 → 1828.22] You know?
[1830.42 → 1831.02] I'm sorry.
[1832.24 → 1839.58] I definitely see how there are formats where skills-based matchmaking might not make that much sense.
[1839.66 → 1844.50] I mean, even, okay, coming back to Halo Infinite, the one semi-competitive game, I guess, I play that actually has,
[1844.50 → 1849.04] MMR, I guess, is what our player, what's the player ranking?
[1850.26 → 1853.34] It, like, depends sort of on how it's being handled.
[1853.50 → 1855.18] But if you say MMR, most people know what you mean.
[1855.20 → 1855.36] Yeah.
[1855.44 → 1861.52] So it's probably the one game I play these days that actually has, like, a persistent MMR that chases you across all the different formats.
[1861.52 → 1866.08] But if you're playing Big Team Battle, yeah, I could see them playing a little faster and looser with it.
[1866.24 → 1866.42] Yeah.
[1866.56 → 1868.82] Because things are just sort of generally more chaotic.
[1868.82 → 1879.52] But if you're playing, like, a 4v4 format, one person being out of whack completely destroys the gameplay experience for everyone,
[1879.68 → 1881.96] including themselves, whether they realize it or not.
[1881.96 → 1892.94] I just thought of another argument that might come up for the anti-skill-based matchmaking crowd is that some games do lock you out from being able to play with your friends if there's too much of a gap.
[1893.62 → 1893.88] Yeah.
[1894.16 → 1895.38] I know that used to be a thing.
[1895.56 → 1896.32] And that's a bummer.
[1896.46 → 1902.04] But, like, the answer to that is just allowing user servers, right?
[1902.08 → 1905.96] Like, the answer to that is not to not have an MMR and not have skills-based matchmaking.
[1905.96 → 1913.14] In my opinion, that combination of dedicated user servers and skill-based matchmaking is the absolute prime.
[1913.20 → 1914.06] That's the way to go.
[1914.14 → 1914.34] Yeah.
[1914.58 → 1919.44] And I'm not saying you shouldn't be allowed to play with your friends, or you shouldn't be allowed to...
[1919.44 → 1925.18] I mean, Luke and Joe and I would lobby up with my son when he...
[1925.18 → 1926.68] He's getting kind of sweaty, actually.
[1926.82 → 1927.98] I was going to say he's probably better now.
[1928.12 → 1929.54] Every time I play with him, he's a little better.
[1929.54 → 1929.82] I know.
[1930.06 → 1934.80] But we would lobby up with him, and we would know that we're going to have to carry him and that, you know,
[1934.80 → 1939.12] the matchmaking is going to be a little bit weird because I'm going to go probably...
[1939.12 → 1940.76] Well, I'm all over the place.
[1940.86 → 1948.34] I'll be anywhere from, like, sub one to, like, four to one, depending on how things are going for me.
[1949.80 → 1950.20] Anyway.
[1950.50 → 1951.58] Genuinely pretty confusing.
[1952.02 → 1952.68] Doesn't matter.
[1952.84 → 1955.62] The point is that Luke and Joe are both perfect.
[1955.94 → 1960.24] I'm this X factor and then my son was going to go, like, you know, one in 15 or whatever.
[1960.38 → 1961.98] So we knew that was going to happen.
[1961.98 → 1967.66] And I would never argue that you shouldn't be allowed to play the game you want to play it.
[1967.98 → 1974.14] But there's a time and a place, and you have to understand why these systems are in place and that it's not about you.
[1974.14 → 1978.94] It's about creating an environment where everybody has a fair chance to win.
[1979.48 → 1981.50] And bad skills-based ranking?
[1981.96 → 1982.56] Yeah, that sucks.
[1983.04 → 1983.08] Yeah.
[1983.08 → 1993.42] Like, if you've got skills-based matchmaking, and you're being dumped time and time again into matches where you are getting absolutely just destroyed,
[1994.66 → 1996.50] I mean, it could be one of two problems.
[1996.68 → 1999.90] It could be that their skills-based ranking system is not very good.
[2000.10 → 2000.88] Or it could be three problems.
[2000.94 → 2005.64] It could be that the servers are really light and that they just don't have a lot of options for matching things up.
[2005.64 → 2015.32] But problem number three is that you could have run into three a**holes who are playing on Smurf accounts and are ruining the system for everyone.
[2015.64 → 2015.74] Yeah.
[2015.74 → 2025.64] So, to me, I mean, the problem so often is not the game, but the gamers.
[2026.30 → 2027.00] Yeah, yeah.
[2028.00 → 2036.76] I think if everyone in good faith engages in a skills-based matchmaking system, I think it can work really well.
[2037.12 → 2040.08] I think you especially run into trouble if people are not.
[2040.08 → 2042.16] I don't know, man.
[2042.18 → 2049.30] I feel like I'm going to end up lit on r slash cod or something like that over this, but I've had worse.
[2049.30 → 2051.70] Maybe there are parts of the argument that we don't know.
[2051.88 → 2052.28] I don't know.
[2052.38 → 2054.46] But it seems pretty straightforward to me.
[2054.68 → 2055.62] I don't know.
[2057.14 → 2058.00] Something I like.
[2058.08 → 2062.36] So, if there isn't dedicated servers, and you're still just using matchmaking on both sides,
[2062.60 → 2066.62] something that I like is when there's ranked and the rank is very much in your face,
[2066.62 → 2071.26] and when there isn't ranked, and it's still skill-based matchmaking,
[2071.48 → 2074.06] I prefer it if you can find it, if it's possible.
[2074.32 → 2074.52] Yep.
[2075.02 → 2077.40] Sure, don't show the up and down after every game.
[2077.50 → 2078.82] Don't make it a centre feature thing.
[2078.90 → 2082.86] But if I can, like, go into my profile and find it somewhere, that's kind of cool.
[2083.04 → 2088.58] Because, like, for me, it's I would like to know if I'm getting better, if that makes sense.
[2088.58 → 2096.44] Yeah, and, I mean, for me, I did find it frustrating that when I was, when I signed up for playing ranked,
[2097.28 → 2101.64] you know, that, because when I was in that mood, I was playing ranked.
[2101.78 → 2107.12] But when I signed up for quick play or whatever else, it turned out I was playing ranked as well.
[2107.22 → 2113.42] Like, I think a lot of this could be solved by these companies just having a separate game mode
[2113.42 → 2116.56] that is skills-based ranking or not skills-based ranking.
[2116.56 → 2120.26] I mean, providing player choice is never a bad option.
[2120.78 → 2128.50] But what I suspect that people would discover is these high-skilled players that want to go dunk on noobs
[2128.50 → 2134.18] in the not skills-based ranking mode are going to discover that none of those people want to be in there with them.
[2134.36 → 2136.28] Like, I used to sweat super hard in League of Legends.
[2136.94 → 2140.98] And something that I would do is in the non-ranked mode.
[2142.76 → 2143.58] Is that a thing?
[2144.72 → 2145.52] Pretty sure that's a thing.
[2145.52 → 2146.14] Am I tripping?
[2146.14 → 2146.58] No.
[2147.58 → 2149.46] Yeah, there's ranked and not ranked.
[2149.56 → 2149.68] Okay.
[2149.76 → 2150.76] It's been a long time.
[2150.84 → 2152.24] I haven't cared about League in, like, a decade.
[2153.46 → 2158.42] But when I used to sweat in League, I would only play very specific characters in ranked.
[2158.82 → 2159.94] And I would try really hard.
[2159.98 → 2160.18] Yep.
[2160.62 → 2165.96] And then in not ranked, maybe sometimes I'd play those characters, but I wouldn't really be trying as hard.
[2166.16 → 2168.96] Or I'd be experimenting with new item builds or something.
[2169.04 → 2172.82] Usually I'd be doing something that wasn't exactly the same as what I'd be doing in ranked.
[2172.82 → 2174.12] Trying a new item build.
[2174.20 → 2175.00] Trying a new opener.
[2175.34 → 2176.36] Trying new landing partners.
[2176.86 → 2177.92] Trying a new lane even.
[2179.08 → 2182.28] Maybe even going as far as trying entirely new characters.
[2182.42 → 2185.76] Like, I don't want to be evaluated at the same level as I was in ranked.
[2186.44 → 2188.06] So I do appreciate that as well.
[2188.24 → 2189.14] Who's your main?
[2189.70 → 2191.42] I used to call her Ashy.
[2191.62 → 2194.28] And then I heard people that run the game say her name.
[2194.38 → 2196.04] And now it's Ash, apparently.
[2196.40 → 2196.62] Oh.
[2196.80 → 2197.38] And that's fine.
[2197.62 → 2197.84] Oh.
[2198.36 → 2198.92] Oh, man.
[2199.00 → 2199.26] Luke.
[2200.26 → 2201.40] That's a silent E.
[2201.40 → 2203.32] I liked Ashy more.
[2203.56 → 2204.32] I prefer that name.
[2204.90 → 2205.22] Ashy?
[2205.50 → 2205.68] Yep.
[2205.84 → 2206.20] All right.
[2206.46 → 2206.64] Yep.
[2207.02 → 2207.54] Fun fact.
[2207.60 → 2211.36] That's my little brother's nickname as a like, small child.
[2211.68 → 2212.24] Oh, cool.
[2212.48 → 2212.64] Yeah.
[2214.38 → 2216.32] Um, anywho, what are we supposed to be doing, Dan?
[2217.36 → 2218.34] He's not paying attention.
[2218.66 → 2219.24] I am.
[2219.30 → 2221.20] I just have my mic muted in here.
[2221.28 → 2222.80] No, he was cutting the grass.
[2223.00 → 2223.50] You could hear him.
[2223.52 → 2224.38] That was Dan out there.
[2224.60 → 2225.80] My extra job.
[2226.00 → 2226.78] Mowing the lawn.
[2227.10 → 2227.28] Yeah.
[2227.28 → 2229.06] He's got to pick up some side hustles.
[2229.26 → 2231.12] You know, LMG doesn't pay like it used to.
[2231.36 → 2231.68] Yeah.
[2232.26 → 2235.90] We can do merch messages in 10 minutes, or you could do another topic up to you.
[2236.22 → 2236.48] Sure.
[2236.56 → 2237.56] Let's do another topic.
[2238.46 → 2240.02] What about this one, speaking of Dan?
[2240.04 → 2240.22] Sure.
[2240.28 → 2240.72] Go for it.
[2240.72 → 2242.06] I didn't even look at what you clicked on.
[2242.30 → 2243.86] Uh, do your invoice, Dan.
[2244.26 → 2245.10] Oh, yes.
[2245.80 → 2246.40] Uh, okay.
[2246.44 → 2248.24] So we talked about this previously on the show.
[2248.36 → 2252.74] Dan has not invoiced me correctly for the help with the memorial for my sister.
[2253.28 → 2256.00] So I have put a note in the show today.
[2256.24 → 2260.66] Dan needs to make the invoice and send it to me now, or I will not proceed with the show.
[2261.76 → 2262.16] Okay.
[2263.72 → 2264.40] I'll wait.
[2264.40 → 2271.46] Luke, you can talk, but I will not participate in the show until Dan is done sending me a proper invoice.
[2272.12 → 2274.14] Uh, what do I go talk about?
[2274.28 → 2275.74] I, I'm...
[2275.74 → 2278.66] CH5609 says, value yourself properly.
[2279.38 → 2283.48] Dan sent me an invoice for the help that he gave me that was not enough.
[2283.48 → 2288.20] And so I have informed him that he will send me a bigger invoice.
[2288.74 → 2291.86] And I talked about this on the show a week ago or two weeks ago.
[2292.00 → 2297.22] I have since then sent him three follow-ups, and he has not returned an invoice to me.
[2298.02 → 2300.18] To be fair, it was on my personal email.
[2301.56 → 2301.96] Yes.
[2301.96 → 2305.28] Which is extremely reasonable, but I guess I just don't check it enough.
[2305.74 → 2307.62] I don't think that was the reason.
[2308.00 → 2309.72] Dude, I like never check my personal email.
[2309.82 → 2310.80] It's like a problem, actually.
[2310.84 → 2311.12] Oh, yeah.
[2311.20 → 2314.58] My personal email is just like delivery notifications.
[2314.58 → 2324.46] Like I, I basically don't have a personal email, which could be a problem someday if I ever just don't work here anymore, get fired or something.
[2324.64 → 2325.26] There you go.
[2325.78 → 2326.32] That's sent.
[2326.48 → 2328.78] He promises that I have a proper invoice.
[2328.78 → 2330.64] I sent you a proper invoice once.
[2331.20 → 2335.02] This is a larger number money for a different rate card, but sure, whatever.
[2335.18 → 2335.74] Whatever, dude.
[2335.92 → 2336.18] Fine.
[2337.06 → 2344.26] I, I, I don't know if I'm offended that you thought that I would give you a good rate or something just because, I don't know.
[2344.36 → 2344.88] I don't know, man.
[2347.24 → 2350.10] No, Dan, look, I don't mean any offence by it.
[2350.36 → 2356.60] What I mean is that people should be valued for the look, Mark tried to comp me for the, for the, um.
[2358.28 → 2358.72] Ah.
[2358.78 → 2359.46] Ah, what was it?
[2359.50 → 2360.28] For the compilation.
[2361.02 → 2365.16] From, from that one, for the second, we had to do a, uh, harrowing experience.
[2365.24 → 2368.66] We had to do a second memorial because my grandparents couldn't make it to the first one.
[2368.66 → 2370.48] And there was a bunch of family drama around that.
[2370.54 → 2375.34] Anyway, the point is, uh, we had a compilation, uh, which by the way, the footage from the first one turned out great.
[2375.42 → 2376.20] Thank you very much, Dan.
[2376.28 → 2376.68] And Brandon.
[2376.96 → 2377.16] Brandon.
[2377.32 → 2378.16] Our old camera editor.
[2378.32 → 2379.02] Our camera editor.
[2379.24 → 2381.38] Our old camera guy actually helped with it as well.
[2381.38 → 2383.36] So they both helped put the whole thing together for me.
[2383.36 → 2387.08] Um, anyway, Mark tried to comp me on the compilation that he did for that.
[2387.12 → 2388.62] And I'm having the same argument with him.
[2389.04 → 2392.86] Him, I can't leverage stopping the show until he deals with it.
[2392.86 → 2393.32] I didn't comp you.
[2393.96 → 2394.68] You did.
[2394.68 → 2397.06] Let me put it this way.
[2397.14 → 2397.58] Let me put it.
[2399.46 → 2399.92] Hold on.
[2399.94 → 2401.24] I haven't even looked at this number yet.
[2401.24 → 2403.90] This is, this is pretty funny to observe because, uh.
[2403.98 → 2404.98] Makes me feel bad.
[2405.06 → 2407.22] I think, I think Dan is genuinely frustrated.
[2407.60 → 2408.24] I am.
[2408.40 → 2410.52] I, I, I don't know.
[2410.62 → 2418.24] I, like, he specifically said, you know, don't give me a good rate because, so I just gave him the rate card for the work that I did.
[2418.50 → 2419.00] Well, you are.
[2419.00 → 2420.14] And now he's like, it's wrong.
[2420.20 → 2421.54] Give me the different rate card.
[2421.54 → 2425.28] Well, then Dan, so now I feel bad, and I'm getting called out publicly on it.
[2425.36 → 2425.68] We know.
[2425.68 → 2427.46] And I've been stewing on this, and it's like.
[2427.62 → 2434.70] No, we need to have a conversation because I think, I believe very strongly that you are undervaluing your time.
[2435.82 → 2437.12] That's what, that is my.
[2437.18 → 2439.42] For that service that you bought from me.
[2440.46 → 2442.04] No, no, no.
[2442.04 → 2448.58] Because, because the, the reason you can do that service is all the is all the wealth of experience that you have.
[2448.58 → 2453.64] Like, yeah, you didn't do that much, but other people couldn't do it.
[2454.84 → 2455.58] I guess.
[2455.72 → 2456.04] Yeah.
[2458.08 → 2458.44] No.
[2458.70 → 2459.10] Yes.
[2459.20 → 2459.58] Yes.
[2460.20 → 2461.06] It's important.
[2461.60 → 2462.28] Even this.
[2462.34 → 2465.32] I don't think the hour count is right, but that's okay.
[2465.36 → 2467.72] You sent it to me in a sheet so I can just edit it.
[2469.16 → 2470.36] Oh my God.
[2470.44 → 2471.10] This guy.
[2471.24 → 2471.56] All right.
[2471.60 → 2472.24] That's good enough.
[2472.28 → 2473.56] At least I'm on a Google sheet.
[2473.56 → 2476.50] And as far as I can tell, I have sharing privileges on it, so I'll deal with it.
[2477.66 → 2478.28] Good chat.
[2483.18 → 2483.68] Oh my goodness.
[2483.68 → 2484.98] I'm quitting freelancing.
[2485.52 → 2486.56] These clients are awful.
[2486.66 → 2490.68] They either don't pay or they're like, I, I can't, I don't understand what a tip is.
[2492.66 → 2493.90] Just pay me in cash.
[2494.44 → 2496.94] It's like, you say 5%, don't tell the government.
[2496.94 → 2501.90] Oh no.
[2503.18 → 2503.88] Oh boy.
[2504.22 → 2508.16] I have an update while we're in the announcement section.
[2508.32 → 2508.82] I have an update.
[2508.82 → 2509.40] Love you guys.
[2509.82 → 2510.82] You too, Dan.
[2511.98 → 2516.44] On the video we did where we reviewed people's setups internally.
[2516.68 → 2517.14] Oh yeah.
[2517.32 → 2520.58] I went to go actually buy Nolan a monitor.
[2521.04 → 2521.44] But?
[2522.06 → 2524.42] He has two sick new ones already.
[2524.42 → 2528.46] That monitor was just like a bait.
[2528.68 → 2529.94] Was he Memling on us?
[2529.94 → 2532.36] His other monitors were like flood damaged.
[2532.58 → 2534.88] So he borrowed that monitor from a friend.
[2534.94 → 2535.36] It was temporary.
[2535.36 → 2536.30] I want his lunch back.
[2536.42 → 2537.02] He was getting.
[2537.02 → 2539.26] I want his $10 Uber Eats gift card back.
[2539.26 → 2544.02] He was waiting for his like flood damage insurance and then just balled out and bought two sick
[2544.02 → 2544.50] monitors.
[2545.56 → 2546.06] All right.
[2548.74 → 2549.52] Well, I mean.
[2549.56 → 2551.08] I was legitimately going to buy him a monitor.
[2551.82 → 2552.08] Yeah.
[2552.14 → 2553.42] Whatever excuse you give yourself.
[2553.52 → 2553.86] It wasn't good.
[2553.86 → 2556.34] I was literally shopping for one.
[2556.36 → 2556.94] He was going to.
[2557.78 → 2558.52] He would have done it.
[2558.56 → 2559.86] He would have got you a birthday present.
[2560.00 → 2560.20] Wow.
[2560.58 → 2561.92] He thought of it and everything.
[2562.20 → 2562.50] Wow.
[2562.80 → 2563.90] I can't fight this.
[2565.14 → 2566.14] It's indefensible.
[2566.88 → 2567.16] Man.
[2567.62 → 2573.78] Speaking of the number of people that were upset about the prize being lunch in the form
[2573.78 → 2575.38] of a $10 Uber Eats gift card.
[2575.76 → 2577.24] Even though we like altered.
[2577.24 → 2577.36] It's a joke.
[2577.36 → 2577.58] It's a joke.
[2577.58 → 2578.74] We altered the headline.
[2578.86 → 2578.96] Yeah.
[2579.04 → 2582.74] I mean, it was the prize because there is no prize because it's just a funny video.
[2583.46 → 2584.20] But the prize.
[2584.20 → 2585.88] It was crowd strike.
[2585.96 → 2586.40] It was crowd.
[2586.48 → 2589.52] We actually had the unaltered headline, and then it like changed.
[2589.66 → 2590.72] It was a hee ha ha.
[2590.72 → 2592.22] He's joke.
[2592.80 → 2593.56] He's joke.
[2593.68 → 2594.20] He's funny.
[2594.54 → 2595.20] He's funny.
[2595.84 → 2596.76] He's so funny.
[2598.76 → 2599.50] Hurts me.
[2599.50 → 2601.72] You know what doesn't hurt?
[2601.94 → 2602.60] Merch messages.
[2602.86 → 2603.88] Let's do some merch messages.
[2604.10 → 2606.78] The way to interact with the show is, of course, merch messages.
[2607.04 → 2608.90] Don't leave a super chat or a Twitch bit.
[2609.00 → 2609.78] Leave a merch message.
[2609.86 → 2611.06] Go to LTTstore.com.
[2611.12 → 2615.44] We've got all kinds of great products for you to check out over there, including our new
[2615.44 → 2617.02] Chroma t-shirt.
[2617.46 → 2620.50] It's inspired by the chromaticity diagram.
[2620.72 → 2624.92] One of the best tools to represent the range of colours visible to the human eye.
[2625.40 → 2628.42] Why wear one colour when you can wear all of them?
[2628.42 → 2629.78] And black.
[2630.58 → 2636.34] Like always, it's printed on our custom LTT blanks that are soft, cozy, and shrink resistant.
[2636.70 → 2641.10] We also are calling out, even though there is no particular deal on it or anything.
[2644.66 → 2645.42] Ah, yes.
[2645.96 → 2646.62] You can put it on?
[2646.70 → 2646.90] Yeah.
[2647.26 → 2649.24] It's going to take a while, though, because buttons.
[2649.60 → 2653.00] It's a paradigm that I've never really fully wrapped my head around.
[2653.12 → 2657.36] It's like a shirt that takes several times longer to put on because it has buttons in the front.
[2657.36 → 2657.96] But you know what?
[2657.96 → 2658.94] You can't argue with the look.
[2659.26 → 2662.20] We're also promoting the MAC address Oxford.
[2662.42 → 2671.88] It's designed to be a fun and versatile shirt that you can dress up or down, inspired by the shirt that our host, Jonathan Horst, actually wore in the very first MAC address video.
[2672.36 → 2674.62] The fabric comes with a little bit of stretch for added comfort.
[2674.78 → 2677.66] And it has a little MAC address logo embroidered on the corner of the shirt pocket.
[2677.66 → 2679.32] I was going to figure that out.
[2680.10 → 2681.66] I would have realized.
[2682.62 → 2682.96] Ugh!
[2683.78 → 2684.44] There we go.
[2685.64 → 2691.50] Yes, I am one of those monsters who only partway unbuttons it and then slips it over the top.
[2691.62 → 2692.20] I hate this.
[2692.32 → 2692.66] I feel...
[2693.20 → 2693.80] I feel...
[2693.80 → 2694.98] I bet you don't even own cuff links.
[2694.98 → 2699.02] I haven't even seen anybody call me out yet, but I feel called out.
[2699.82 → 2700.08] Oh, yeah.
[2700.16 → 2700.40] I'm sure.
[2700.40 → 2701.00] Looks good on you, though.
[2701.22 → 2701.62] Thank you.
[2701.74 → 2702.12] Of course it does.
[2702.12 → 2702.72] Nice shirt.
[2703.82 → 2705.16] What did I just see?
[2705.16 → 2711.78] Yeah, what do you guys want from me, okay?
[2711.84 → 2712.66] What do you guys want?
[2712.74 → 2722.96] And anyway, the reason we're featuring this one is not for any reason other than that Maria, who worked on the photos for it, was really proud of the photo shoot that they did.
[2724.32 → 2728.60] And really wanted us to feature the pictures on the show because we didn't do it before.
[2728.78 → 2729.74] That's super cute.
[2730.08 → 2731.04] They're great photos.
[2731.48 → 2734.94] She has really been stepping up her game.
[2735.16 → 2735.36] Yeah.
[2736.10 → 2738.00] The product photos are doing very well.
[2738.04 → 2738.48] Oh, yeah.
[2739.36 → 2739.76] Outstanding.
[2739.90 → 2740.46] Look at this.
[2740.74 → 2741.90] How cute is this?
[2742.60 → 2743.12] No way.
[2743.36 → 2746.88] I think they're in the same place that we did the photo shoot for the photography challenge.
[2747.28 → 2749.34] That little, like, walking path near the office.
[2749.52 → 2750.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2750.26 → 2750.48] Yeah.
[2750.76 → 2751.64] Oh, well, I don't know.
[2751.64 → 2751.88] Whatever.
[2752.20 → 2753.20] Where Colton has the...
[2753.20 → 2755.36] Yeah, where Colton's pregnant or James is pregnant.
[2755.44 → 2756.12] One of them is pregnant.
[2756.28 → 2759.92] I think James is posing as Colton's partner and Colton is pregnant.
[2760.12 → 2760.80] Yeah, yeah.
[2760.94 → 2761.34] Fantastic.
[2761.46 → 2764.48] And for those of you who don't know, there are...
[2764.48 → 2768.06] Both standard and tall sizes.
[2768.44 → 2768.56] Whoa.
[2768.92 → 2769.24] What?
[2770.32 → 2770.76] What?
[2771.14 → 2771.80] No way.
[2771.92 → 2772.32] What?
[2772.50 → 2772.96] Oh, wait.
[2773.10 → 2775.54] Oh, well, apparently they've been popular.
[2775.70 → 2776.26] Small, tall.
[2776.78 → 2777.22] Unavailable.
[2777.42 → 2784.66] We might have some lanky tiny boys in our community.
[2784.66 → 2788.84] I want to see an LTT, like, vest to go along with it as well.
[2789.04 → 2791.86] Anyway, to leave a merch message.
[2792.04 → 2795.68] All you got to do is add an item to your cart, leave a merch message, and check out, and it'll
[2795.68 → 2798.06] go to producer Dan, who will, I don't know...
[2798.06 → 2798.92] Not invoice you.
[2799.10 → 2802.94] ...bitterly complain about just, you know, wanting to be valued for his work or whatever.
[2803.62 → 2808.02] He'll forward it to someone internally or reply to it himself, pop it up at the bottom
[2808.02 → 2811.98] like this, or he will curate it for me and Luke to respond to.
[2812.06 → 2814.68] Why don't we do a couple curated ones to show the people how it works?
[2815.30 → 2815.52] Sure.
[2815.62 → 2816.02] Let's see.
[2816.02 → 2817.22] Hey, LLD.
[2817.40 → 2818.26] Question for Linus.
[2818.26 → 2822.24] After getting hands-on with the Total Gaming Zone, are there any features that you think
[2822.24 → 2824.84] would make you switch to that from the ally?
[2825.44 → 2831.26] I mean, the fact that it is the only non-Steam deck that has...
[2833.30 → 2839.18] If I recall correctly, man, I don't want to say the wrong thing, so I'm just going to double
[2839.18 → 2841.56] check and make sure that it's the right one that I remember.
[2841.64 → 2843.64] I believe it comes with dual trackpads, though.
[2843.64 → 2849.98] Yeah, if I recall correctly, it's the only non-Steam deck handheld that has dual trackpads.
[2850.34 → 2856.78] So if you wanted the improved performance of the Z1 Extreme compared to the Steam deck,
[2856.84 → 2863.10] which is a significant uplift, but you wanted dual trackpads, then this kind of seems like
[2863.10 → 2864.48] the only game in town.
[2864.60 → 2868.46] Everything else about it seemed pretty fine, I guess.
[2868.46 → 2871.80] But I think that is their most obvious...
[2871.80 → 2875.00] That's their most obvious selling point.
[2875.42 → 2877.34] The adjustable triggers is kind of cool.
[2877.44 → 2878.70] Personally, I don't use them.
[2879.12 → 2885.96] But this really opens up different gaming experiences that with dual joysticks is not necessarily possible.
[2885.96 → 2890.18] I know it's a bit of a dead meme, but Civ.
[2891.50 → 2891.94] Yeah.
[2892.12 → 2894.38] Having touchpads like that is a lot nicer compared to Joysticks.
[2894.38 → 2895.08] How does Civ a dead meme?
[2895.16 → 2895.80] People love civilization.
[2895.80 → 2902.40] No, I just mean, like, we've been saying that for, like, eight years or something.
[2902.52 → 2902.92] Oh, sure.
[2903.02 → 2906.68] It's always been the example for, like, oh, this would be cool.
[2906.88 → 2911.22] Oh, I can use this Steam controller from, like, what was, like, 2015 or whatever,
[2911.32 → 2912.58] so I can play Civ on my couch.
[2912.66 → 2914.08] Like, it's been the same example the whole time.
[2914.08 → 2915.40] Wow, people are super called out.
[2915.74 → 2917.36] Ki frig is like, I'm playing Civ right now.
[2917.56 → 2918.14] Yeah, that's cool.
[2918.18 → 2919.04] How dare you?
[2919.14 → 2919.28] Good.
[2919.48 → 2920.56] I added the last part.
[2922.70 → 2923.92] He felt it, though.
[2923.92 → 2924.46] Hit me, Dan.
[2925.60 → 2926.20] Hello, guys.
[2926.36 → 2928.92] A month or two ago, Raspberry Pi went public.
[2929.18 → 2933.18] Many worry that they will now become like any other greedy corporate company.
[2933.52 → 2934.06] What are your thoughts?
[2934.22 → 2936.34] I would be lying if I wasn't a bit worried.
[2936.90 → 2938.24] That is sort of the point.
[2938.24 → 2950.26] Honestly speaking, I have been kind of observing that the Raspberry Pi Foundation already wasn't really doing Raspberry Pi Foundation things.
[2950.52 → 2952.46] Like, and you know what?
[2952.52 → 2955.52] I'm sure that there are factors that I'm not aware of.
[2955.56 → 2958.12] I don't have any insider knowledge here or anything like that.
[2958.12 → 2976.76] But the fact that it has been so difficult to get a Raspberry Pi, like a first-party Raspberry Pi at MSRP for so long, to me is just a clear indication that they don't want to make enough of them at the super low price.
[2976.76 → 2992.12] Like, if it was over the course of the, you know, silicon shortage during the pandemic or if it was for a short period of time, apparently it hasn't been hard to get an MSRP Pi for over a year.
[2992.28 → 2992.88] So, okay.
[2994.38 → 2995.96] The sold out for most days of selling.
[2996.80 → 2997.82] Yeah, I don't know.
[2997.98 → 3003.78] It's also been a huge known problem of Raspberry Pi since, like, basically launched, and they launched in 2012.
[3004.34 → 3004.68] So, like.
[3005.02 → 3005.32] Okay.
[3005.32 → 3007.22] Them just solving it in the last years?
[3007.80 → 3008.70] Well, yes and no.
[3008.80 → 3011.80] I mean, they have had valid reasons for a lot of that time.
[3011.98 → 3026.06] So, all I can really say is it seemed to me that they were operating less like a not-for-profit foundation and more like just a company that makes little computers for a long time.
[3027.14 → 3027.46] I hadn't.
[3028.22 → 3028.64] Yeah, go ahead.
[3028.64 → 3032.80] The second you go public, you're beholden to whatever shareholder owns the most shares.
[3033.30 → 3033.58] So, like.
[3035.32 → 3035.78] I don't know.
[3036.78 → 3041.46] Mad Max Buyer says they sold them to industry and professionals in priority as far as I know.
[3041.54 → 3041.66] Yeah.
[3041.70 → 3048.76] See, like I said, these are all things that I don't have any insider knowledge for.
[3048.76 → 3052.14] I don't know a ton about it.
[3052.14 → 3058.48] But other than to say that they are split now between Raspberry Pi Foundation and then, like, Raspberry Pi, the company.
[3058.62 → 3061.30] And I forget what the exact naming is or exact breakdown is.
[3061.30 → 3082.82] And the only reason to do that would be to pursue profit for the sake of your corporate shareholders. So I can absolutely see why you would be concerned because basically going public and being beholden to shareholders seems like a downhill slide every time it happens.
[3082.82 → 3091.16] With that said, I mean, there's no reason to say that a company couldn't be terrible because of private equity holders.
[3091.62 → 3092.62] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[3093.10 → 3096.02] Just because you don't go public doesn't mean you're a good company.
[3097.12 → 3101.80] It might even mean the opposite. You want to be able to do more things in the shade.
[3102.42 → 3106.32] Apparently Sony is a major stakeholder. Okay, well, that's fun.
[3107.16 → 3110.80] This link has a locator for Raspberry Pis at MSRP.
[3110.80 → 3114.98] RPiLocator.com.
[3116.10 → 3117.68] All right.
[3118.90 → 3127.48] So Pie Shop US and Pie Shop California, Canada are both in stock.
[3128.62 → 3130.40] What is update status? No.
[3131.08 → 3131.98] What does that even mean?
[3136.04 → 3138.06] Yeah, in stock. So there you go.
[3138.06 → 3141.02] Maybe everything's fine, at least for now.
[3141.52 → 3142.28] Good luck, everybody.
[3146.48 → 3147.62] Hit me with one more, Dan.
[3148.10 → 3148.90] Oh, yeah, sure.
[3149.34 → 3149.60] Sure.
[3150.38 → 3151.22] Let's have a look.
[3151.78 → 3153.40] Hey, Bo, Luke, and Daisy.
[3154.20 → 3158.46] Thoughts on how to get a change in a niche duopoly?
[3158.46 → 3166.24] I work in radiotherapy physics, and choice is cheap and bad versus expensive and good.
[3166.38 → 3168.62] How to make cheap up their game at least a little.
[3172.20 → 3172.72] Wow.
[3173.26 → 3177.68] You want me to solve, like, antitrust issues?
[3177.94 → 3178.46] Good luck, bro.
[3178.46 → 3179.90] You got this.
[3179.90 → 3181.04] You have 180 characters.
[3181.24 → 3181.34] Go.
[3181.82 → 3182.38] Yeah.
[3184.18 → 3185.58] Good luck, everybody.
[3187.24 → 3192.06] I send them words of encouragement.
[3192.54 → 3194.26] While you're at it, you want to solve capitalism?
[3194.84 → 3195.16] Yeah.
[3195.80 → 3196.32] Hunger.
[3196.32 → 3207.14] I appreciate the desire, but I don't think there's really anything you can do.
[3208.06 → 3211.28] Cheap isn't going to be incentivized by...
[3211.28 → 3215.84] They're both really not really going to be incentivized by anything other than profit.
[3216.06 → 3219.84] If you can convince cheap, they'll get more of the market if they make their things better.
[3220.80 → 3221.28] Sure.
[3221.46 → 3223.88] But they're probably getting their market by being affordable.
[3223.88 → 3227.92] Yeah, and that's probably affecting their R&D budgets.
[3228.16 → 3228.26] Yep.
[3233.00 → 3243.74] Yeah, and in a field like radiotherapy, I don't think that you necessarily want to encourage
[3243.74 → 3249.40] the use of the one that you know is bad, just so that they can get more revenue.
[3250.06 → 3250.58] Yeah.
[3250.86 → 3252.52] So that's real tough.
[3253.88 → 3254.42] Real tough.
[3256.38 → 3256.82] Okay.
[3257.48 → 3258.66] Why don't we do another topic?
[3258.78 → 3259.50] Luke, do you want to pick one?
[3260.14 → 3260.54] Sure.
[3260.80 → 3261.02] Yeah.
[3261.10 → 3263.72] Hopefully, you know, something...
[3263.72 → 3264.54] How about some good news?
[3264.54 → 3266.68] Can the EU save video games?
[3266.70 → 3267.26] Ooh, yeah.
[3267.36 → 3268.02] This is exciting.
[3268.30 → 3272.84] A few weeks ago, the EU registered Stop Destroying Video Games as a Citizens Initiative,
[3273.80 → 3279.20] a petition that EU citizens can go sign onto if they want an official response from the EU government.
[3279.20 → 3285.52] The initiative is part of Ross Scott's Stop Killing Games movement, and it aims to prevent publishers
[3285.52 → 3290.22] from remotely rendering games unplayable when they decide to discontinue support.
[3290.54 → 3293.48] This week, the petition opened for online signatures.
[3293.86 → 3298.52] Its organizers will have a year to collect at least a million signatures, which I'm fairly
[3298.52 → 3302.04] sure they will do, but they'll only do so if you go sign it.
[3302.04 → 3303.20] So please do so right now.
[3303.56 → 3308.62] They will also have to hit a minimum number of signatures from citizens within seven EU
[3308.62 → 3309.18] countries.
[3309.78 → 3314.06] All one million signatures can't just come from one country, for example.
[3314.56 → 3317.16] However, these thresholds are relatively low.
[3319.12 → 3324.46] I'm posting the link in all the various chats everywhere where people watch the WAM show.
[3324.46 → 3330.90] So now's a perfect time, if you are a citizen of these places, to head over there
[3330.90 → 3332.00] and register.
[3333.04 → 3335.66] This is kind of important.
[3335.92 → 3340.76] I mean, in the grand scheme of things, no, it's not that important.
[3340.76 → 3347.24] But as gamers, if we want to have any chance of preserving the gaming experiences that we're
[3347.24 → 3351.84] having right now before they all just get sunset by the developers or maybe more likely the
[3351.84 → 3358.46] publishers, you've got to get on this because this is the most momentum we've ever had
[3358.46 → 3360.36] by a country mile.
[3360.66 → 3360.98] Oh, yeah.
[3361.28 → 3361.70] Yeah, yeah.
[3362.72 → 3365.10] So I dropped links in all the chats, guys.
[3365.26 → 3366.96] Do what you can to spread the word.
[3366.96 → 3378.26] If you know even one person in Bulgaria, get them to register to issue a statement of support.
[3378.26 → 3383.74] It'll help a bit, which is all we can really hope for.
[3386.12 → 3386.88] Is that it?
[3387.78 → 3388.04] No.
[3388.30 → 3390.24] This week, the petition opened for online signatures.
[3390.40 → 3393.10] Its organizers will have a year to collect those signatures.
[3393.58 → 3394.32] Oh, I already said that bit.
[3394.58 → 3398.30] The petition doesn't ensure legal action, but it will obligate political leaders in the
[3398.30 → 3399.54] EU to respond to the issue.
[3400.88 → 3401.68] Very interesting.
[3402.06 → 3404.86] Alexander asks if there's an update on the backpack zipper replacement.
[3404.86 → 3405.62] Actually, there is.
[3406.14 → 3409.14] I got a whole timeline for it.
[3410.52 → 3415.14] Basically, we have already done priority ones where people contacted us saying that it's
[3415.14 → 3418.46] broken, and then the rest of them are going out in waves.
[3419.04 → 3420.50] And I'm just going to check real quick.
[3423.28 → 3425.38] Here we go.
[3425.62 → 3426.14] Here we go.
[3426.24 → 3427.24] Shipping waves and scheduling.
[3427.24 → 3432.52] So, wave one is complete.
[3434.60 → 3437.52] Wave two is...
[3437.52 → 3437.78] Oh, wait.
[3437.84 → 3441.24] No, wave one will be complete by September 9th.
[3442.08 → 3443.36] Wave two will be complete.
[3443.46 → 3445.44] So, this will be another 5,000 to 10,000 units.
[3445.58 → 3447.74] This will be complete by the end of September.
[3448.34 → 3450.88] Wave three should be complete in early October.
[3451.42 → 3453.90] Wave four should be complete by end of October.
[3454.10 → 3456.24] And wave five should be complete in November.
[3456.24 → 3461.30] So, we should have all of them out by November.
[3462.36 → 3462.84] Yay!
[3463.16 → 3465.34] Finally, the end of this epic saga.
[3466.00 → 3468.08] You're still dealing with that, asks Scrappy DP.
[3468.50 → 3468.80] Yeah.
[3469.00 → 3477.28] So, it turns out when you sell 40,000 of something with a defective something on it, and there's
[3477.28 → 3484.14] four of them on each one, and you need to make 160,000 replacement defective things.
[3484.94 → 3485.54] Might take a sec.
[3485.80 → 3486.72] It takes a minute.
[3488.04 → 3488.20] We basically...
[3488.20 → 3489.28] Those things are metal, right?
[3490.04 → 3490.94] Yeah, they made a titanium.
[3491.16 → 3491.38] Yeah.
[3491.38 → 3498.60] So, we basically, like, developed a product that we don't sell, that we just send to people
[3498.60 → 3500.14] who got a bad product.
[3500.94 → 3504.82] As you can imagine, we're a little put out by the whole thing, given that the carabiner
[3504.82 → 3506.44] was developed by our backpack partner.
[3506.60 → 3508.58] So, we're, like, super not stoked on all that.
[3508.68 → 3512.48] But, I mean, we're committed to doing the right thing, even if it takes us a minute.
[3512.76 → 3513.76] We want to do it right.
[3513.76 → 3516.86] The last thing we wanted to do was send out something that was just going to fail again.
[3517.06 → 3519.54] So, yeah, we're still dealing with it.
[3519.68 → 3522.20] But, hey, we're dealing with it.
[3522.44 → 3524.08] So, can't...
[3524.08 → 3524.50] Yeah, I know.
[3524.58 → 3525.04] I'll leave that.
[3525.14 → 3525.58] So, cool.
[3526.10 → 3530.48] Speaking of things that should potentially be dealing with a recall, hey, why don't we
[3530.48 → 3532.46] talk about Intel this week?
[3533.50 → 3541.22] Intel has extended warranties on 13th and 14th gen CPUs, which is good.
[3541.22 → 3547.18] But, that is about the only good news coming out of Intel this week.
[3548.02 → 3554.68] For one thing, and this is funny, I was chatting with Wendell from Level 1 Techs, and he pointed
[3554.68 → 3559.88] out something that wouldn't have even occurred to me since I haven't worked in the retail
[3559.88 → 3560.72] biz for a while.
[3561.22 → 3566.14] So, you can buy Intel CPUs, Trey, or OEM.
[3566.14 → 3571.24] And, generally speaking, for end users, it doesn't make a ton of sense to do that because
[3571.24 → 3575.26] the savings are tiny if you're just buying one Trey chip.
[3575.36 → 3581.42] There have been times when buying an OEM CPU or, like, a Trey CPU has been a hack to save
[3581.42 → 3582.74] a significant amount of money.
[3582.74 → 3594.20] Like, I remember back in the Athlon XP days, you could pick up these mobile, like, 2500
[3594.20 → 3600.00] plus mobile chips that were only available as a Trey part, and they were significantly less
[3600.00 → 3604.48] expensive, and they were rumoured to be better binned than the desktop 2500 pluses.
[3604.54 → 3606.94] And the only drawback was they didn't come with a heat sink.
[3606.94 → 3610.18] And they only came with a one-year warranty instead of a three-year warranty.
[3610.66 → 3614.02] You might see where I'm going with this, with warranty differences.
[3614.54 → 3622.48] So, anyone who's buying these 13th and 14th gen chips in bulk might be buying them OEM in
[3622.48 → 3627.42] order to save on the cost of the cooler and, you know, shipping the box around because they
[3627.42 → 3628.30] just, they come in a tray.
[3628.42 → 3630.06] They literally come in a tray if you buy enough of them.
[3631.42 → 3634.74] They are not getting the warranty extension.
[3635.40 → 3635.80] Oh!
[3635.80 → 3638.36] So, they're just left with...
[3638.36 → 3638.76] Oh!
[3638.82 → 3640.56] And the funny thing about it to me is that...
[3640.56 → 3641.78] That seems unwise.
[3641.90 → 3646.04] The difference in price, at least everywhere I'd ever seen it, and maybe there's a bigger
[3646.04 → 3650.42] difference if you're negotiating this directly with Intel or whatever, but the difference
[3650.42 → 3657.26] in price that I had seen over the years did not really justify the difference in warranty
[3657.26 → 3658.24] coverage to me.
[3658.32 → 3663.38] Like, it seems like Intel could probably afford, based on what people are paying for these things,
[3663.38 → 3665.58] to just extend the warranty for them as well.
[3665.58 → 3672.06] But currently, it does not look like Intel is planning to extend the warranty of OEM parts,
[3672.12 → 3675.32] at least unless I hear otherwise.
[3676.26 → 3677.72] So, that's some bad news.
[3677.94 → 3679.86] And it gets even worse.
[3679.86 → 3684.38] This week, Intel announced 15,000 layoffs.
[3684.94 → 3691.60] And I've got to say, I don't think that number is actually fully up to date.
[3692.64 → 3693.16] Because...
[3693.16 → 3693.32] Do you think it's more?
[3693.88 → 3694.52] Yeah.
[3695.12 → 3695.42] Really?
[3695.64 → 3699.40] The scuttlebutt in the office this morning, yeah, it's gone up.
[3699.40 → 3709.42] Intel says it will cut around 19,000 jobs, as it aims to save $10 billion in a year.
[3712.14 → 3718.72] They also are apparently cancelling anything non-essential in order to cut costs.
[3719.24 → 3725.34] Intel's stock recently hit a 50-year low, and this is why I don't give financial advice.
[3725.34 → 3729.98] And this follows two consecutive quarters of financial losses.
[3730.84 → 3736.84] It is unclear how well the company will shoulder the cost of outsourcing its upcoming Lunar Lake chips.
[3737.26 → 3741.92] So, Intel has traditionally enjoyed very good margins on their silicon products,
[3741.94 → 3744.16] because they do their fabrication in-house.
[3744.60 → 3749.56] But they have chips coming that are not fabricated by Intel's own fab.
[3750.04 → 3754.76] I still believe in Pat Gelsinger's vision, if he does get a chance to execute on it,
[3754.76 → 3758.50] of turning Intel into a fab company, as well as a chip company.
[3759.04 → 3765.62] I still think that's, maybe at this point, the only path forward for them.
[3766.12 → 3770.14] But my goodness, has this ever been a rough week.
[3772.88 → 3773.32] Sorry.
[3773.92 → 3775.08] Yeah, what are you looking at?
[3775.48 → 3781.16] I don't know all the history behind this yet, but of course, Wall Street Bets has some epic ness.
[3781.46 → 3781.76] Oh, yeah?
[3781.76 → 3786.58] Looks like someone dropped 700K on Intel, like, right then.
[3786.92 → 3790.68] And it has a current return of minus 200,000.
[3790.86 → 3792.92] Man, I've seen some wild lost porn over there.
[3792.92 → 3796.14] Well, I've seen a lot worse than this, but just like, this is on topic.
[3796.40 → 3796.56] That's all.
[3796.56 → 3797.60] That's pretty rough, though.
[3797.88 → 3798.52] Pretty rough.
[3798.82 → 3798.94] Yeah.
[3798.94 → 3811.98] Also on the subject of Intel's CPU woes, in response to our video summarizing the current situation with unexpected degradation on 13th and 14th gen CPUs on Tech Quickie,
[3812.44 → 3821.66] some commenters felt that the video included out-of-date explanations and unnecessarily placed blame on Intel's motherboard partners.
[3821.66 → 3831.72] And our discussion question here is, this is a perfect example of why we introduced our new bad faith comment policies across the forum and YouTube comments.
[3832.56 → 3835.28] Ironically, Reddit seems to be kind of self-moderating at this point.
[3835.38 → 3838.02] So we haven't made any changes there.
[3838.02 → 3840.02] But...
[3840.02 → 3841.66] Wow, wait.
[3841.74 → 3842.32] Good job, Reddit.
[3842.62 → 3842.82] What?
[3842.82 → 3843.12] I know, right?
[3843.72 → 3854.52] But guys, the number of people commenting on that video, talking about how Level 1 Techs has covered this so much better and were ignorant and whatever else.
[3856.32 → 3859.76] Wendell from Level 1 Techs literally collaborated on the video.
[3860.64 → 3862.78] Literally proofed the script.
[3862.78 → 3868.72] So you can argue with the Tech Quickie video, but if you are, you're arguing with Wendell.
[3869.18 → 3870.18] And you might be right.
[3871.44 → 3873.64] I mean, his video might be better or might not be better.
[3873.68 → 3873.98] I don't know.
[3874.08 → 3877.28] Or it might cover it from a different angle.
[3877.40 → 3877.66] Totally.
[3878.88 → 3882.50] We've always said you should watch with breadth.
[3882.88 → 3884.56] You should get opinions from different areas.
[3885.12 → 3885.56] Absolutely.
[3885.86 → 3886.36] I love watching.
[3886.54 → 3890.96] But at the end of the day, the video is getting dislike-bombed, essentially.
[3890.96 → 3899.84] And it really does feel like we've reached just this tipping point of ridiculousness where whatever we say is wrong because we said it.
[3899.92 → 3904.26] And it has nothing to do with where we sourced the information or how accurate it is.
[3904.26 → 3912.94] But we collaborated not just with Wendell from Level 1 Techs, but we also worked extensively with Kelt from Falcon Northwest,
[3913.22 → 3922.88] who has been working on this in the background for much longer than you guys have been aware of it or other members of the tech media have been aware of it
[3922.88 → 3932.30] and has actually provided some really cool insights into how this whole thing has devolved to the point that it's reached now.
[3932.30 → 3935.98] So, I don't know.
[3936.30 → 3940.96] I guess good job outing yourself as someone who didn't watch the whole video
[3940.96 → 3946.20] or who's just not really open to anything we say.
[3949.30 → 3952.84] Conveniently, that makes it really easy for us to cull the herd.
[3953.62 → 3954.14] See you later.
[3954.72 → 3955.04] Never.
[3955.04 → 3960.78] Oh, I guess I never really said what I was talking about.
[3960.90 → 3970.32] So, on the community posts feature of YouTube, we formalized our sort of bad faith commenting policy.
[3970.88 → 3976.10] And Chewy actually asked me to give some examples of what exactly that means
[3976.10 → 3984.56] because a lot of people are concerned that it means that you're not allowed to leave any feedback that's critical of us or our videos.
[3984.56 → 3988.06] And that is absolutely not the case.
[3988.46 → 3993.12] So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to dig into the thread that I have with our forum moderators
[3993.12 → 3995.88] where we kind of discussed this rollout with them.
[3996.20 → 3999.58] And I'm going to dig up some of the examples of what this would be.
[3999.98 → 4003.84] And I'm not going to, like, harp on people leaving mean comments or whatever.
[4004.00 → 4005.06] This isn't going to be one of those.
[4005.06 → 4013.62] But I want to give people some reassurance that this isn't like, oh, you can't say you disagree.
[4013.76 → 4014.88] You absolutely can.
[4014.98 → 4015.78] I mean, that's how we learn.
[4015.88 → 4016.66] That's how we get better.
[4016.78 → 4019.20] That's absolutely valuable to us.
[4019.20 → 4024.24] But we can't have people just making stuff up and then presenting it as fact
[4024.24 → 4029.04] and then allowing that misinformation to fester within our own community.
[4029.04 → 4031.50] There's nothing we can do about what takes place elsewhere.
[4031.66 → 4035.64] But we are absolutely not going to allow it in our own community.
[4036.20 → 4042.04] So, one example that I'll give now is anyone who said that our PS Portal video was sponsored.
[4042.72 → 4043.36] That's it.
[4043.42 → 4043.74] You're gone.
[4043.82 → 4044.04] You're done.
[4044.10 → 4044.38] You're out.
[4045.18 → 4046.04] It wasn't.
[4046.18 → 4046.86] It just wasn't.
[4046.86 → 4051.40] You don't get to say something that isn't true on our platform.
[4051.98 → 4054.10] You don't get to just make it up and then be mad about it.
[4054.14 → 4054.54] It's not.
[4054.98 → 4057.00] That's not a right that you have, I'm afraid.
[4057.52 → 4059.84] Luke, do you want to do a topic real quick while I get signed in to the forum?
[4059.90 → 4061.42] Because I'm not signed in to the forum on this computer.
[4061.42 → 4061.66] Sure.
[4062.08 → 4064.06] Which probably makes sense because I probably shouldn't be.
[4064.38 → 4065.04] But now I will be.
[4065.04 → 4066.98] But now you're signed in to everything else bad anyway.
[4067.12 → 4067.96] So, it doesn't really matter.
[4070.70 → 4071.10] Let's.
[4071.22 → 4071.44] No.
[4073.20 → 4073.92] Let's see.
[4076.86 → 4082.44] Researchers find and stop potential stalking vulnerabilities in dating apps.
[4082.82 → 4087.52] Belgian researchers found that several popular dating apps, including Bumble, Grindr, and Hinge,
[4087.86 → 4089.90] all have had the same vulnerability.
[4090.38 → 4090.54] Sorry.
[4090.66 → 4097.30] All had the same vulnerability that could have been used to find the near exact location of another user.
[4097.68 → 4098.62] Oh, dude.
[4099.14 → 4101.56] So much for the all positive WAN show.
[4101.76 → 4103.92] This is like the worst thing ever.
[4104.10 → 4104.68] That's rough.
[4104.68 → 4105.16] Yeah.
[4105.16 → 4106.88] These problems have since been fixed.
[4107.02 → 4108.42] However, following researchers.
[4109.72 → 4112.58] Following researchers reaching out to these companies.
[4113.32 → 4114.80] Oh, so it was fixed afterwards.
[4114.92 → 4116.32] I mean, that's not too surprising.
[4116.76 → 4119.16] The vulnerability required no hacking knowledge.
[4119.38 → 4119.60] Ooh.
[4120.02 → 4125.06] Instead, a malicious person could use the proximity tracker in the app to triangulate another user's position.
[4125.20 → 4129.62] Simply by moving in small increments until they are no longer listed.
[4129.94 → 4131.48] I guarantee you people did that.
[4131.58 → 4133.60] That's like the most obvious thing in the world.
[4133.60 → 4134.14] Oh, yeah.
[4134.34 → 4139.70] So they could just triangulate someone's position by just moving around.
[4139.92 → 4144.10] Make sure they're on the edge of your detection bubble and then go around until you find exactly.
[4144.20 → 4145.14] Yeah, that's super simple.
[4145.14 → 4147.34] Apparently it was accurate to within about two meters.
[4148.34 → 4152.70] So they're not obfuscating the distances of people at all or weren't.
[4152.92 → 4153.42] Yikes.
[4153.42 → 4161.00] According to researchers, this would be enough information to estimate the user's location within a few yards.
[4161.14 → 4161.28] Yeah.
[4161.60 → 4167.42] The apps fixed these issues by making coordinates less precise, though rounding up by...
[4167.42 → 4169.24] Through rounding up by three decimal places.
[4169.80 → 4170.08] Okay.
[4170.08 → 4174.40] Why do you need to know even, like...
[4175.40 → 4177.36] I don't even really get it.
[4177.46 → 4181.62] Like, shouldn't you just be able to tell if they're in literally, like, the city?
[4183.02 → 4184.34] Yeah, that should be enough.
[4184.40 → 4185.40] That should be enough.
[4185.70 → 4186.54] Look, you're a developer.
[4186.72 → 4190.30] Wouldn't it just be easier to just go like, oh, here's their GPS location.
[4190.40 → 4192.56] We'll just stick that in our thing.
[4192.90 → 4195.00] Instead of, like, extrapolating any data from that.
[4195.44 → 4195.82] Sure.
[4196.16 → 4198.38] But, like, don't do that?
[4198.82 → 4199.46] Yeah, but it was easy.
[4200.02 → 4200.66] You're right.
[4200.76 → 4201.86] It's just frustrating.
[4205.64 → 4206.04] Okay.
[4206.64 → 4208.66] The discussion questions are probably already...
[4208.66 → 4208.96] I don't know.
[4208.96 → 4212.82] Why is it so hard for people making these tools to foresee all the potential and malicious uses?
[4212.90 → 4214.68] Because there isn't any funding behind doing that.
[4215.02 → 4220.26] And how often are we just reproducing the same mistakes without realizing it constantly?
[4220.66 → 4220.82] Yeah.
[4220.82 → 4222.82] I, um...
[4224.56 → 4232.76] I mean, I don't expect them to come up with every malicious way that someone can use a tool.
[4233.24 → 4233.68] Right?
[4233.76 → 4238.38] Like, you can't predict all the awful ways that someone could maim someone else with a hammer.
[4239.06 → 4241.48] And that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have hammers.
[4241.64 → 4244.02] And that doesn't mean that we should blame the inventor of the hammer.
[4244.02 → 4254.76] But this, getting the location of people on dating apps, seems like it probably should have been something they thought of.
[4254.82 → 4255.52] Maybe an option.
[4256.40 → 4262.90] Someone was like, being that Grindr is for hookups, across town can be a dealbreaker.
[4263.14 → 4267.38] It's like, okay, well that should be an opt-in at the very least.
[4267.78 → 4268.08] Right.
[4268.08 → 4272.68] Like, it either shouldn't be a thing at all and should still just be like a city or whatever.
[4273.22 → 4273.92] Tokyo is a city.
[4274.02 → 4275.06] Okay, so a district.
[4275.24 → 4275.62] I don't know.
[4275.86 → 4276.66] Something big.
[4276.92 → 4279.28] Like, I don't think this is super complicated.
[4279.28 → 4288.12] Um, but it should be either a vague area, some large area of some kind, uh, that you wouldn't be able to pinpoint someone within.
[4288.48 → 4293.00] Or, if you like, very explicitly said, like, make me findable.
[4293.32 → 4297.78] Like, maybe you're at like a, uh, a festival of some sort.
[4298.02 → 4299.90] And you like, want people to come up and say hi.
[4300.10 → 4300.90] Like, sure, why not?
[4301.10 → 4302.14] But, yeah.
[4303.80 → 4305.70] Kristen said, as a woman, it's a terrifying thought.
[4305.76 → 4306.64] Yeah, that makes sense.
[4306.64 → 4311.46] I, I, I think it's extremely reasonable for that to be a very scary thought.
[4316.20 → 4316.80] All right.
[4317.42 → 4322.94] Um, I'm going to get through this as quickly as we can, just so that people have some examples of what we mean.
[4323.22 → 4323.42] Sure.
[4323.52 → 4335.04] So, here's a comment where someone accuses us of dragging our, our, an LTT video out past the 10-minute mark so that we can, um, so we can milk more ads out of it.
[4335.04 → 4336.22] More YouTube ads out of it.
[4336.22 → 4336.82] That's awesome.
[4337.30 → 4341.50] So, the issue here is that it's not even 10 minutes anymore.
[4342.18 → 4347.68] Um, I forget what the limit is because, um, we don't have mid-roll ads on LTT.
[4349.62 → 4350.86] So, there are two problems.
[4351.50 → 4356.26] Um, yeah, you don't, again, so you don't get to make up a problem and then be mad about it.
[4356.26 → 4363.78] Um, this kind of, this kind of weird projection is another example of something that's just not going to pass anymore.
[4364.12 → 4368.54] Um, so this is, I think this was on, might have been the building.
[4368.66 → 4369.12] Oh, shoot.
[4369.22 → 4370.76] I had meant to censor usernames.
[4370.90 → 4371.34] Well, whatever.
[4371.82 → 4373.12] Yeah, they've been in both so far.
[4373.64 → 4374.62] Oh, I thought it wasn't the first one.
[4374.72 → 4375.10] It was.
[4375.20 → 4375.36] Whoops.
[4375.36 → 4375.76] Oh, well.
[4376.08 → 4376.76] They'll get over it.
[4377.02 → 4380.70] Um, so this, I think, was on the building the CEO PC.
[4380.70 → 4386.24] Like, the like, the, the, the co-host was, like, scared of me or something.
[4386.96 → 4392.12] And I'm just, I'm sitting here going, what are you even, what are you even talking about?
[4393.16 → 4395.74] Um, let's see.
[4395.86 → 4396.42] Oh, man.
[4396.64 → 4398.36] Yeah, this one, this one's a boozy.
[4398.56 → 4402.24] So, this is on the we tried 5G blocking paint video.
[4403.20 → 4405.70] Um, this guy might have eaten the paint.
[4406.34 → 4410.10] This Canadian company that makes this paint also sells a shield to put under your laptop
[4410.10 → 4414.80] because all laptop computers emit EMF and continuous exposure has the potential to cause serious
[4414.80 → 4418.84] health problems such as sterility in men, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4418.92 → 4424.10] They also sell shielded hoodies, ball caps, bush hats, boxers, uh, et cetera, et cetera, ET
[4424.10 → 4424.42] Peter.
[4424.88 → 4428.44] Oddly, the children's items are t-shirts, no lotions or goggles either.
[4428.76 → 4430.38] This is my last visit to LTT.
[4430.68 → 4433.58] Yes, you are judged by the company you keep.
[4434.50 → 4435.80] Were you, like, making fun of it?
[4436.12 → 4436.42] Yeah.
[4436.94 → 4437.34] Nice.
[4437.34 → 4444.34] And so, there's people that are worried that we are going to, uh, there's people that are
[4444.34 → 4449.58] worried that just, like, jokes are going to get caught by this, you know, bad faith, uh,
[4449.58 → 4450.12] policy.
[4450.98 → 4451.92] I could understand that.
[4452.12 → 4453.12] And I understand that.
[4453.46 → 4454.98] But this isn't about that.
[4454.98 → 4464.30] This is, this is people who have such a have such a, uh, a sour position on us and our content
[4464.30 → 4472.48] that they weren't even willing to pause for a second and go, this seems so ridiculous that
[4472.48 → 4475.88] maybe I'm the one who misunderstood the situation.
[4475.88 → 4482.12] Um, so that's, that's it, guys.
[4482.38 → 4484.10] That, that's all I have to say about that.
[4484.26 → 4487.28] Well, I, like, used to be against, against moderation.
[4487.84 → 4493.52] Um, and these days I'm, I'm not because I think the internet has never been as divisive.
[4493.52 → 4498.60] Um, did, did these comments have traction?
[4499.64 → 4499.96] Uh.
[4500.00 → 4502.52] Or did you just find them by reading every single comment on the video?
[4502.52 → 4503.86] It doesn't matter anymore.
[4504.54 → 4508.00] Um, because what I've actually found is that.
[4508.06 → 4511.12] I don't mean in, as a resistance to doing the thing, to be clear.
[4511.14 → 4511.38] No, no.
[4511.40 → 4512.24] Mostly just curiosity.
[4512.24 → 4516.38] Some of them, some of them do, most of them don't.
[4516.50 → 4516.58] Yeah.
[4516.66 → 4516.84] Okay.
[4516.94 → 4524.92] And so because it's a very vocal, small minority, um, it's, it actually hasn't been a ton of
[4524.92 → 4532.74] work to clean things up a fair bit, but we also just, it's hilarious because, um, I
[4532.74 → 4537.72] saw some people kind of criticizing us for the new policy and I saw some people who get
[4537.72 → 4542.00] it because they're like, look, the only reason you know about this is that they're telling
[4542.00 → 4542.24] you.
[4542.62 → 4542.82] Yeah.
[4542.92 → 4547.32] Once again, LMG's transparency bites them in the butt because you wouldn't even be having
[4547.32 → 4552.36] this conversation because you'd be shadow-banned, um, if they didn't tell you in advance.
[4552.78 → 4558.34] So it's been on a very small scale up until now, but we're announcing it formally so people
[4558.34 → 4558.92] understand.
[4559.32 → 4563.20] If you're going to comment that we missed something in a video, you better make bloody well
[4563.20 → 4564.68] sure that you watched the video.
[4565.90 → 4570.44] Don't comment that we missed an important point if you watched the first 30 seconds.
[4570.44 → 4572.64] And I'm not saying you have to watch the whole video.
[4572.72 → 4575.26] You don't, but don't come in guns blazing.
[4575.40 → 4575.88] That's all.
[4577.62 → 4578.48] It's all I ask.
[4583.68 → 4585.44] All right, let's go.
[4586.94 → 4588.20] What do you want to talk about next?
[4588.76 → 4589.96] Dan, what are we supposed to do?
[4589.96 → 4591.96] Okay.
[4592.64 → 4594.16] Well, why don't we talk about.
[4596.74 → 4597.14] Hmm.
[4597.58 → 4601.08] Oh, YouTube continuing the ad blocker arms race.
[4601.08 → 4608.20] Users of various ad blockers have reported seeing blank black screens on YouTube videos,
[4608.30 → 4611.98] which linger for five to 20 seconds before the video plays.
[4612.24 → 4618.18] It is speculated that these are ads that have been partially blocked and a possible sign of
[4618.18 → 4622.06] the server side ad injection technology that YouTube is reportedly working on.
[4622.54 → 4624.26] Our discussion question here.
[4624.28 → 4625.92] Actually, let's get to the discussion question in a minute.
[4625.92 → 4627.46] Here's what I want to know.
[4628.48 → 4636.68] Why exactly would you see a black screen if the video, if the ad is embedded within the
[4636.68 → 4637.80] video stream itself?
[4638.58 → 4642.28] How could an ad blocker block it, but not block it?
[4643.34 → 4646.20] Do you have any kind of deeper understanding of how that would happen?
[4647.70 → 4648.98] Not really, to be honest.
[4650.00 → 4650.16] T.
[4650.24 → 4653.50] Lewis in chat in float plane chat says, yeah, I got, I got the black screen.
[4653.50 → 4656.88] Refreshing the page works, but it's weird.
[4657.30 → 4658.24] It makes it go away?
[4659.02 → 4661.32] As in you don't get the black screen anymore and the video just makes?
[4661.32 → 4663.80] I'm not sure what they mean by refreshing the page works.
[4667.48 → 4670.82] Ki frig says, I had those happen a while ago, but they stopped.
[4672.72 → 4675.82] I have, so there are some comments coming in on the comment moderation thing.
[4675.88 → 4679.54] And I just, instead of typing this out, because technically it's an assumption, I'll just ask
[4679.54 → 4679.90] you live.
[4679.90 → 4684.18] Um, I think people are overestimating how often these actions will be taken.
[4684.30 → 4686.20] How often do you think these actions are taken?
[4686.78 → 4691.78] Um, I would say on a given video, probably five to 10 people are going to end up with
[4691.78 → 4692.08] a ban.
[4693.14 → 4694.94] How many comments are on a given video?
[4695.40 → 4697.46] Uh, anywhere from hundreds to thousands.
[4699.86 → 4702.24] Over time, I expect the numbers to go way down.
[4702.46 → 4703.18] Pretty rapidly.
[4703.18 → 4707.52] There's, there's, I can't remember, we talked about on WAN show, it was some study that like,
[4707.52 → 4713.72] um, bad actors and in things like, uh, forums and things like that.
[4715.10 → 4721.64] It's, it's a very, very small number of individuals that cause a very huge portion of the disruption.
[4721.96 → 4722.36] Yep.
[4722.46 → 4724.58] So hopefully it won't be very much.
[4724.68 → 4725.28] Yeah, pretty much.
[4725.28 → 4731.36] I've found when, when moderating communities that like, you deal with some edge cases and
[4731.36 → 4732.48] then generally it's mostly fine.
[4733.36 → 4735.66] Um, the smaller the community, the easier it is.
[4735.72 → 4738.10] So there's definitely going to be some challenges, but yes.
[4738.58 → 4741.78] Um, I'm, I'm not, I'm not too worried about it.
[4743.06 → 4743.70] Uh, okay.
[4743.72 → 4745.52] What was the main topic we were on?
[4746.80 → 4748.22] It derailed us too much.
[4748.22 → 4752.54] Um, users have reported seeing blank black screens on YouTube videos.
[4752.54 → 4754.34] I don't know how that would work.
[4754.50 → 4761.80] How could YouTube manage to serve a long black video sequence, but not the ad?
[4762.00 → 4762.26] Yeah.
[4763.26 → 4764.20] Yeah, that's odd.
[4766.72 → 4773.72] Blocking it or not like it to my previous interpretation of it was kind of like a yes or no type of situation.
[4774.60 → 4776.30] Um, so yeah, I'm not really sure.
[4776.52 → 4777.28] I'm not sure how that works.
[4777.28 → 4788.58] I wonder if if YouTube has like a fail state or if it doesn't have a certain amount of data, it just pushes through this like, yeah, black video.
[4788.68 → 4789.30] I have no idea.
[4789.54 → 4789.94] Interesting.
[4790.06 → 4790.36] Not sure.
[4791.32 → 4794.66] We've got a video coming as part of the Google your life.
[4794.70 → 4796.78] Part two, we'll be talking about ad blocking.
[4797.18 → 4806.68] Uh, we'll be talking about, uh, in particular on YouTube, because I think for our audience, YouTube is going to be one of the biggest challenges.
[4806.68 → 4817.98] Um, in the first, in the first episode, I think we got into, uh, like web browser, uh, DNS and the second one we go, man, we go deep.
[4817.98 → 4822.58] Uh, so password managers, um, trying to think what else is in it.
[4822.60 → 4822.70] Yeah.
[4822.76 → 4826.50] So for those of you waiting, D Google your life part two is shot now.
[4826.50 → 4830.30] And Emily has been working her way through the guidance for it this week.
[4830.76 → 4831.90] Uh, should be coming.
[4832.04 → 4834.46] In fact, it may even be on the schedule now.
[4834.52 → 4837.50] I think it's at a stage of completion that it may be scheduled.
[4837.60 → 4838.70] Let me have a quick look here.
[4839.20 → 4841.46] Oh, speaking of things that are scheduled though.
[4841.46 → 4847.52] Scrapyard Wars part two is up on float plane.
[4848.20 → 4848.46] Yeah.
[4848.80 → 4850.18] Uh, no, it's not scheduled yet.
[4850.56 → 4852.70] Um, the reviews are in.
[4853.20 → 4855.22] People are flipping, loving it.
[4855.28 → 4856.18] I'm so excited.
[4856.26 → 4859.40] I'm so glad we waited a week and let them, let them cook.
[4859.66 → 4867.06] Uh, it's got a whatever this works out to 50 to one like dislike ratio or something like that.
[4867.06 → 4869.12] People are absolutely loving it.
[4869.26 → 4871.48] Ah, best format on the internet.
[4871.60 → 4872.30] Let's go.
[4872.82 → 4882.52] Uh, so we're going to have, uh, this will be up on YouTube on Tuesday, and we're going to be trying to do early access for Scrapyard Wars throughout the series over on floatplane.com.
[4882.62 → 4888.40] So that's leg.GG slash float plane if you want to sign up and get more Scrapyard Wars.
[4889.52 → 4890.70] You haven't watched it yet.
[4890.88 → 4891.00] No.
[4892.06 → 4892.88] Read the title.
[4892.88 → 4895.16] So the title is, it's not cheating.
[4895.50 → 4896.68] It's strategy.
[4897.06 → 4897.62] Read the title.
[4898.00 → 4898.18] Yeah.
[4898.34 → 4899.54] So, uh, what?
[4901.34 → 4901.78] What?
[4902.46 → 4904.08] It wasn't my team that said that.
[4904.42 → 4905.40] That's all I have to say.
[4906.10 → 4907.32] Well, it might've been my team.
[4907.70 → 4907.94] Yeah.
[4908.22 → 4908.44] Yeah.
[4908.48 → 4909.34] There's only two teams.
[4909.46 → 4909.60] Yeah.
[4909.64 → 4910.24] There are two teams.
[4910.42 → 4910.64] Yeah.
[4911.00 → 4911.68] Might've been my team.
[4911.90 → 4912.12] Yeah.
[4912.36 → 4915.72] So, I mean, you, okay.
[4918.48 → 4920.02] Oh, do I spoil anything?
[4920.10 → 4920.78] Should I spoil anything?
[4920.94 → 4921.02] No.
[4921.84 → 4922.28] Okay.
[4923.56 → 4924.50] Don't spoil anything.
[4924.90 → 4925.08] Okay.
[4925.26 → 4925.88] I'm, I'm, you know what?
[4925.88 → 4928.22] I'm not gonna, I'm not going to spoil anything.
[4928.36 → 4929.38] I'm not going to spoil anything.
[4929.74 → 4933.68] Also, you don't want to talk about it too much because we might do a like commentary reaction
[4933.68 → 4934.26] streaming thing.
[4934.34 → 4934.82] That's true.
[4934.94 → 4935.12] Yeah.
[4935.12 → 4941.42] What I know what I know for sure is that you already know about anything that I did.
[4942.48 → 4946.12] In fact, you knew at the time.
[4946.12 → 4947.34] So, it couldn't be that bad.
[4947.34 → 4950.14] So, it's just strategy.
[4951.04 → 4953.94] And if you don't like it, I mean, there's always the option of getting good.
[4953.94 → 4954.94] Yeah.
[4954.94 → 4955.94] Yeah.
[4955.94 → 4956.50] Yeah.
[4956.50 → 4956.78] Okay.
[4956.94 → 4957.22] Okay.
[4957.40 → 4957.66] Okay.
[4957.66 → 4957.70] Okay.
[4958.12 → 4958.26] Yeah.
[4958.26 → 4959.42] This isn't the finale.
[4959.62 → 4964.02] So, it doesn't even tell you anything that might or might not happen in the, in the days.
[4964.12 → 4968.88] Because I think this only goes up to partway through day two of the challenge.
[4969.64 → 4972.52] So, there's, there's lots more Scrapyard Wars to go.
[4972.60 → 4975.86] I think they, they were pushing initially for three episodes.
[4976.30 → 4976.78] Doing four.
[4977.18 → 4981.22] And after David and I looked at everything that happened, we were like, nah.
[4981.40 → 4982.06] This is four.
[4982.20 → 4982.46] Nah.
[4982.60 → 4985.06] It, it took place over only three days.
[4985.12 → 4988.86] Dude, in the last, like, I, didn't we, mm, nope.
[4990.28 → 4992.84] Yeah, there's, I can't talk about it.
[4992.90 → 4993.78] It's so frustrating.
[4993.78 → 4995.56] I know, I know.
[4995.78 → 4996.26] It was.
[4996.84 → 5000.26] Because I was just going to mention something that happened in content that isn't even available
[5000.26 → 5000.96] anywhere yet.
[5001.06 → 5001.36] Yeah.
[5001.36 → 5002.02] On Float plane.
[5002.14 → 5003.26] So, it's like, oh, okay.
[5003.38 → 5004.20] Yeah, I need to not.
[5004.32 → 5004.94] Don't do that.
[5004.98 → 5006.60] It would have been pretty vague, but still.
[5006.90 → 5007.14] Yeah.
[5007.18 → 5007.88] It's just not worth it.
[5008.02 → 5008.66] I'll tell you what.
[5008.72 → 5010.08] I'll tell you guys one thing.
[5010.08 → 5014.10] You guys already saw Elijah's haircut in episode one.
[5014.98 → 5021.92] Um, there was a Float plane challenge where they asked for, um, 3,000 likes.
[5021.92 → 5022.38] Oh, yeah.
[5022.38 → 5025.22] 3,000 likes on a Float plane exclusive.
[5025.88 → 5026.48] Yeah.
[5026.98 → 5031.44] And if that happened, Luke would work on Elijah's body hair again.
[5031.68 → 5032.04] Yeah.
[5032.24 → 5033.42] They did it today.
[5033.60 → 5036.62] So, if you're on Float plane, you can look forward to that exclusive.
[5037.32 → 5040.56] Um, Luke gave Elijah a slit.
[5042.46 → 5043.54] An eyebrow slit.
[5043.82 → 5044.10] Yeah.
[5044.62 → 5046.38] It's just quite a way to say it.
[5046.54 → 5046.78] Yeah.
[5047.40 → 5049.10] He gave him an eyebrow slit.
[5049.22 → 5049.46] Yeah.
[5049.46 → 5050.90] Um, Luke.
[5050.90 → 5051.82] Okay.
[5051.94 → 5053.28] They didn't give me the right tools.
[5053.82 → 5054.90] You did a great job.
[5054.92 → 5055.82] They didn't give me the right tools.
[5056.22 → 5059.18] All things considered, like the fact that you are a monkey.
[5059.64 → 5060.66] I was not giving the right tools.
[5060.66 → 5061.84] When it comes to working on hair.
[5062.86 → 5064.30] Why does this keep happening?
[5064.30 → 5064.52] Exhibit A.
[5065.06 → 5068.92] In the last, like, two months, I've done three things with other people's hair.
[5069.20 → 5073.78] I don't think I've ever done anything with anyone else's hair ever before that time.
[5073.80 → 5074.32] Yeah, we know.
[5074.32 → 5075.34] What is happening?
[5075.40 → 5075.76] We know.
[5075.90 → 5077.00] Why does this keep happening?
[5079.42 → 5084.76] You know if that video gets like 4,000 likes, he might let me do carving.
[5085.66 → 5086.46] Oh, no.
[5086.56 → 5088.30] And I could put a star on his head.
[5088.36 → 5089.00] Oh, no.
[5091.04 → 5092.82] He has not committed to this.
[5093.32 → 5094.74] I'm just saying he might.
[5095.14 → 5095.80] Oh, man.
[5096.02 → 5096.32] Okay.
[5096.32 → 5096.96] He might be willing.
[5098.48 → 5098.84] Anywho.
[5098.84 → 5101.32] And maybe this time I'll get the proper equipment.
[5102.36 → 5103.04] This is great.
[5103.22 → 5105.34] Dusky says, oh, Luke, we can tell, sweetie.
[5109.72 → 5110.44] Oh, no.
[5110.94 → 5111.30] Okay.
[5111.66 → 5113.08] Dan, what are we doing?
[5115.62 → 5118.38] Dusky also said, do you really want his wife to divorce him?
[5118.86 → 5120.28] She's still with him at this point.
[5120.32 → 5121.50] I think they're probably good.
[5121.50 → 5121.94] Yeah.
[5122.10 → 5127.50] If she hasn't seen anything yet, like with his Belle Delphine merch at this point, then...
[5127.50 → 5129.68] Wait, what was I saying?
[5129.78 → 5133.78] If she hasn't seen anything to scare her off yet, I don't think it's going to happen now.
[5133.86 → 5135.50] Yeah, like some minor haircut changes.
[5135.60 → 5137.42] One other small Scrapyard Warriors announcement.
[5137.58 → 5141.06] Our seasoned partner, Jaw, has launched their Scrapyard Warriors giveaways.
[5141.36 → 5141.54] Oh.
[5141.58 → 5144.04] And you can check them out at the link in the video description.
[5145.22 → 5146.32] I also have another short announcement.
[5146.62 → 5151.12] We're looking for more people to sign up for the Error Checking Community Squad, the ECC Squad,
[5151.30 → 5157.04] which is a crowdsourced fact-checking team that helps LMG deliver the most correct, clear information possible to our audience.
[5157.50 → 5161.00] The ECC is a final check in case anything gets past our internal checks.
[5161.46 → 5164.58] We know that we have a lot of different experts and enthusiasts on our team,
[5164.64 → 5169.46] but we also have even more in our audience whose collective knowledge we could never hope to fully match.
[5169.88 → 5173.58] So we've got a sign-up doc that Dan is going to throw in the chat.
[5175.12 → 5176.00] I am?
[5176.10 → 5176.54] Okay, sure.
[5176.78 → 5177.46] Thanks, Dan.
[5179.20 → 5180.10] Appreciate you.
[5180.10 → 5181.28] All right.
[5181.54 → 5182.50] Luke, do you want to pick a topic?
[5182.50 → 5185.04] No, Elijah is definitely not cutting my hair.
[5185.30 → 5187.52] Just putting that out there.
[5187.54 → 5188.60] How about I could cut your hair?
[5189.28 → 5190.66] How about I could dye your hair?
[5190.90 → 5192.22] I already said yes to that.
[5192.76 → 5193.20] Interesting.
[5193.68 → 5194.90] Maybe I should sponsor it.
[5195.54 → 5197.34] Sponsored by LTTstore.com.
[5197.46 → 5198.40] Make Brand sponsor.
[5198.40 → 5200.08] Yeah, Brand should have to pay for it.
[5200.46 → 5201.46] Build Luke's hair.
[5201.60 → 5202.82] Brand's going to pay for it.
[5202.96 → 5203.90] What doc?
[5203.94 → 5204.68] Where are we?
[5204.90 → 5205.18] What's it?
[5205.18 → 5206.04] Where is it?
[5206.54 → 5206.72] What?
[5207.14 → 5210.20] It's in the announcements field in the perpetual doc.
[5212.28 → 5212.76] All right.
[5212.80 → 5214.74] Why don't we get through sponsors?
[5215.36 → 5215.60] Okay.
[5215.80 → 5216.08] Okay.
[5216.12 → 5217.20] Well, I can't do both at the same time.
[5217.38 → 5218.08] Well, you can try.
[5218.68 → 5220.52] The show is brought to you today by Mans caped.
[5221.74 → 5223.26] Unhappy with your new hairstyle?
[5225.64 → 5226.96] Why are you on me?
[5227.70 → 5228.66] Why are you on me?
[5230.32 → 5234.80] Why not shave it off with our sponsor, Mans caped?
[5234.80 → 5236.54] Did someone throw another bag of money?
[5237.14 → 5238.00] With their new dome...
[5238.00 → 5238.60] Whoa!
[5240.02 → 5247.26] With their new dome shaver pro head shaver, leave all the fuzz behind and shine like a
[5247.26 → 5247.68] diamond.
[5248.60 → 5249.66] Show the product.
[5250.40 → 5255.88] Well, I have not agreed to shave my hair off today.
[5256.06 → 5257.14] You got him tripping over his words.
[5257.14 → 5257.24] Okay.
[5257.24 → 5257.88] Just kidding.
[5258.26 → 5258.90] Not today.
[5259.04 → 5260.80] We'll allow him to take a break this time.
[5261.46 → 5261.70] Dennis.
[5261.70 → 5264.04] Dennis, that is not...
[5264.04 → 5266.24] That's not a thing that you get to decide.
[5266.32 → 5268.24] Anyway, it comes with a little carrying case.
[5268.34 → 5269.88] I don't think either of us are shaving our...
[5269.88 → 5274.06] And then it's got like an ergonomic grip, and you pop this...
[5274.06 → 5276.06] That genuinely looks very convenient.
[5276.56 → 5277.06] Hold on.
[5277.06 → 5278.34] If you had a bald head.
[5278.48 → 5279.40] Let me see if I can figure...
[5279.40 → 5279.64] Oh, yeah.
[5279.68 → 5279.88] Okay.
[5279.94 → 5281.04] It pops on like that.
[5281.36 → 5282.70] And then it's like a...
[5282.70 → 5284.62] Anything like that.
[5284.70 → 5290.54] It has five rotary blades designed for head shaving powered by a 9,500 RPM motor for a
[5290.54 → 5292.42] consistent and efficient shave every time.
[5292.92 → 5297.66] And it has a magnetic blade head making cleaning and replacing the blades a breeze.
[5298.46 → 5303.34] Mans caped also has their new dome soother lotion to moisturize your shiny dome, keeping
[5303.34 → 5305.04] your head bright and beaming.
[5305.04 → 5311.46] Check out the Dome Shaver Pro and Dome Soother Lotion and use code WINSLOW for 20% off and
[5311.46 → 5312.44] free shipping.
[5313.48 → 5314.42] Alrighty then.
[5314.50 → 5315.78] That was unnerving.
[5316.20 → 5319.84] The show is also brought to you by 1PasswordXAM.
[5320.98 → 5321.28] Yes.
[5321.82 → 5325.08] Imagine your company's security like a college campus quad.
[5325.08 → 5331.40] The nice brick paths represent company-owned vehicles, IT-approved apps, and managed employee
[5331.40 → 5331.92] identities.
[5332.64 → 5340.32] The shortcuts through the grass symbolize unmanaged devices, shadow IT apps, and non-employee identities
[5340.32 → 5341.88] like Colton.
[5342.66 → 5350.04] Most security tools only work on the brick paths, but many issues arise on the shortcuts.
[5350.74 → 5354.90] That's where our sponsor, 1Password Extended Access Management comes in.
[5355.08 → 5360.12] It brings all these unmanaged devices, apps, and identities under control, ensuring strong

[5452.66 → 5452.98] What?
[5452.98 → 5453.42] Like, what am I?
[5453.42 → 5453.74] What am I?
[5453.80 → 5456.06] That band dressage athlete?
[5457.80 → 5458.54] Oh, you didn't see this?
[5458.96 → 5459.18] No.
[5459.24 → 5461.14] It was one of the earliest Olympic scandals.
[5461.44 → 5461.62] Oh.
[5461.80 → 5461.92] Yeah.
[5461.92 → 5463.06] Wait, I think you told me about this.
[5463.06 → 5464.06] Yeah, one of the...
[5464.06 → 5466.86] Luke is not up on the dressage discourse.
[5467.12 → 5467.42] Okay.
[5467.42 → 5472.54] See, I think it should be pronounced as dressage, but people keep saying dressage, so I'm like,
[5472.72 → 5472.92] what?
[5473.12 → 5474.02] Isn't it French?
[5474.30 → 5475.40] Well, that's what I thought.
[5475.54 → 5476.54] I thought it was dressage.
[5476.74 → 5481.46] No, but some words are like that, where English people are stupid and don't know that it has
[5481.46 → 5482.98] a French origin, so they're like...
[5482.98 → 5484.76] Anybody that says niche.
[5485.88 → 5486.10] Yeah.
[5486.10 → 5486.86] Instead of niche.
[5487.00 → 5487.54] Yeah, exactly.
[5487.54 → 5488.42] That's a pet peeve of mine.
[5488.56 → 5489.02] I hate that.
[5489.06 → 5489.36] Yeah, niche.
[5489.48 → 5490.48] What are you talking about?
[5490.64 → 5491.20] I don't like that.
[5491.28 → 5491.48] Huh.
[5491.76 → 5492.02] Huh.
[5492.36 → 5492.58] Huh.
[5493.32 → 5496.74] I can't find the thing that I'm supposed to post in chat.
[5496.84 → 5497.12] Okay.
[5497.12 → 5497.66] Well, good.
[5497.76 → 5500.40] Hopefully it is dressage, because that's what it's supposed to be.
[5500.68 → 5502.10] I will be upset if it's not.
[5503.28 → 5503.78] All right.
[5503.92 → 5504.74] He can't find the thing.
[5505.16 → 5505.58] What thing?
[5505.86 → 5506.36] I don't know.
[5506.42 → 5507.30] Where is the thing?
[5507.38 → 5508.44] I don't even know what he's talking about.
[5508.98 → 5509.18] What?
[5509.26 → 5510.26] Dan, you can't find it?
[5510.38 → 5511.02] What is it?
[5511.04 → 5511.50] Where is it?
[5511.50 → 5511.76] It's in the dock.
[5511.76 → 5512.32] It's right...
[5512.32 → 5513.86] I'll highlight...
[5513.86 → 5514.42] Look, I'm gonna...
[5514.42 → 5515.80] I'll make it bigger until...
[5515.80 → 5516.34] Oh, there it is.
[5516.84 → 5517.30] Thank you.
[5519.00 → 5519.66] Oh, that.
[5520.12 → 5520.62] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5521.00 → 5522.42] I'm just going to keep making it bigger.
[5522.48 → 5523.32] No, he said he found it.
[5523.58 → 5523.90] So?
[5524.28 → 5525.36] I'm going to keep making it bigger.
[5525.42 → 5526.30] Now the dock's like...
[5526.30 → 5527.16] It's one of my talents.
[5527.94 → 5529.10] It was unusable before.
[5529.24 → 5529.94] I couldn't find it.
[5531.20 → 5532.60] Yeah, this is an improvement.
[5532.98 → 5533.90] I don't think so.
[5534.78 → 5535.18] Cement.
[5535.56 → 5539.72] It might actually literally be harder to find now if you're on the wrong part of the dock.
[5539.72 → 5542.34] Can I hold this?
[5542.34 → 5543.00] Can you go?
[5543.16 → 5543.50] And!
[5543.72 → 5544.12] And!
[5544.64 → 5545.24] And!
[5545.58 → 5546.84] Let's play And, dude!
[5547.48 → 5550.00] What is Google Docs' font size max?
[5550.00 → 5550.60] I don't know.
[5550.94 → 5553.04] We're at 239...
[5553.04 → 5553.46] 240?
[5553.64 → 5553.92] 250?
[5555.40 → 5557.34] This is getting extremely tedious.
[5557.56 → 5558.52] I wish I had a mouse.
[5559.52 → 5561.44] Now, I'm going to be a banana master by the end of this.
[5561.44 → 5562.16] Can I help you?
[5562.60 → 5563.96] No, I don't think so.
[5563.96 → 5566.74] I mean, we can find out.
[5568.18 → 5569.58] I don't think you're helping.
[5572.38 → 5573.10] Dan's trying too.
[5573.14 → 5573.70] I can hear it.
[5575.02 → 5575.24] Oh!
[5575.40 → 5576.14] No, I do.
[5576.20 → 5577.84] I do think you guys are helping, actually.
[5578.32 → 5578.64] 400.
[5579.12 → 5579.44] Oh.
[5580.46 → 5580.76] Wait.
[5582.52 → 5582.92] Oh!
[5583.14 → 5583.84] It's still going!
[5583.92 → 5584.88] The box breaks!
[5585.50 → 5585.88] Wait.
[5586.26 → 5587.70] No, I don't think it is still going.
[5588.70 → 5588.90] No.
[5588.90 → 5590.20] It's just flashing.
[5590.56 → 5590.68] Yeah.
[5590.74 → 5591.92] My brain was like...
[5591.92 → 5592.66] No, that was it.
[5592.72 → 5593.40] That's all it can do.
[5593.42 → 5594.10] Optical illusion?
[5596.06 → 5597.06] We need to fix this.
[5597.16 → 5598.36] Oh, it lagged out on my end.
[5598.94 → 5599.18] Don't worry.
[5599.18 → 5599.60] I fixed it.
[5599.62 → 5599.88] Uh-oh.
[5600.72 → 5602.38] Who put an 1800 in there?
[5605.44 → 5605.84] Yes!
[5605.84 → 5606.20] Ha!
[5606.20 → 5606.34] Ha!
[5606.34 → 5606.64] Ha!
[5606.64 → 5606.70] Ha!
[5606.70 → 5606.76] Ha!
[5606.76 → 5606.80] Ha!
[5606.80 → 5606.84] Ha!
[5606.84 → 5606.90] Ha!
[5606.90 → 5607.14] Ha!
[5607.14 → 5607.34] Ha!
[5607.34 → 5607.44] Ha!
[5607.44 → 5607.46] Ha!
[5607.46 → 5607.54] Ha!
[5607.54 → 5607.96] Ha!
[5607.96 → 5608.36] Ha!
[5608.36 → 5608.46] Ha!
[5608.46 → 5608.96] Ha!
[5608.96 → 5609.36] Ha!
[5609.36 → 5609.46] Ha!
[5609.46 → 5609.96] Ha!
[5609.96 → 5610.46] Ha!
[5610.46 → 5610.52] Ha!
[5610.52 → 5610.58] Ha!
[5610.58 → 5611.02] Ha!
[5611.02 → 5611.46] Ha!
[5611.46 → 5611.52] Ha!
[5611.52 → 5611.58] Ha!
[5611.58 → 5612.14] Oh, man.
[5613.42 → 5614.28] I want to play ANO.
[5614.28 → 5614.72] Oh, my back.
[5614.72 → 5615.72] ANO's good.
[5615.72 → 5616.72] Oh, my back.
[5616.72 → 5617.72] Oh, I'm dying.
[5617.72 → 5618.02] Okay.
[5618.02 → 5619.44] Okay, what the hell is going on?
[5619.44 → 5619.82] Oh, yeah.
[5619.82 → 5622.04] Uh, the merch message.
[5622.04 → 5623.04] Yeah.
[5623.04 → 5624.04] Ha!
[5624.04 → 5625.04] Ha!
[5625.04 → 5626.04] Ha!
[5626.04 → 5627.00] What even is the show today?
[5627.00 → 5627.52] My job!
[5627.52 → 5628.12] I don't know.
[5628.12 → 5628.62] Ha!
[5628.62 → 5629.12] Ha!
[5629.12 → 5629.62] Ha!
[5629.62 → 5630.12] Ha!
[5630.12 → 5630.62] Ha!
[5630.62 → 5631.12] Ha!
[5631.12 → 5631.62] Ha!
[5631.62 → 5632.12] Ha!
[5632.12 → 5633.32] I am not doing good.
[5633.32 → 5633.82] Ha!
[5633.82 → 5634.32] Ha!
[5634.32 → 5634.82] Ha!
[5634.82 → 5635.52] Let's see.
[5635.52 → 5636.82] Hey, LLD.
[5636.82 → 5643.24] I wanted to ask Linus, how do you find fulfillment and satisfaction in life and your career working
[5643.24 → 5646.64] in such a quick-moving and competitive industry?
[5646.64 → 5648.52] How can you be happy with enough?
[5648.52 → 5650.68] Well, then you should ask me that.
[5650.68 → 5651.68] Wow.
[5651.68 → 5653.84] They wanted to ask me, but I...
[5653.84 → 5654.84] Wow.
[5654.84 → 5655.84] They didn't, so now I...
[5655.84 → 5656.84] I'm sorry.
[5656.84 → 5657.84] That's another pet peeve.
[5657.84 → 5658.84] Don't really feel...
[5658.84 → 5659.84] I apologize.
[5659.84 → 5661.84] Kate, can I ask you a question?
[5661.84 → 5662.84] You just did!
[5662.84 → 5663.84] You're wasting my time!
[5663.84 → 5664.84] Without consent!
[5664.84 → 5665.84] Ha!
[5665.84 → 5666.84] Ha!
[5666.84 → 5667.84] Ha!
[5667.84 → 5668.84] Ha!
[5668.84 → 5671.84] Um, anyway, working in such a quick-moving competitive industry.
[5671.84 → 5672.84] Um, you know what?
[5672.84 → 5674.24] I think that...
[5674.24 → 5682.24] I think that over the years, I have come around to that infinite growth is neither possible,
[5682.24 → 5685.24] nor is it ultimately fulfilling anyway.
[5685.24 → 5692.18] And, um, I think that over time, I've actually developed a much healthier relationship with
[5692.18 → 5695.24] business growth than I think I had before.
[5695.24 → 5700.64] Um, it was probably around the time that we rejected the offer to buy the company that
[5700.64 → 5705.04] I kind of looked at it and went, well, if the goal was to win capitalism, then...
[5705.04 → 5706.04] That was it.
[5706.04 → 5707.04] That was...
[5707.04 → 5708.04] That was my shot.
[5708.04 → 5709.04] That was definitely it.
[5709.04 → 5710.04] Yeah, that was the chance, right?
[5710.04 → 5711.04] So...
[5711.04 → 5712.04] You would've won capitalism.
[5712.04 → 5713.04] So...
[5713.04 → 5714.04] Not that you haven't really already, but...
[5714.04 → 5715.44] I had to kind of...
[5715.44 → 5716.44] I had to kind of decide, right?
[5716.44 → 5722.24] And what I ultimately fell back on was the same thing that, um, that I realized when I
[5722.24 → 5728.44] did the 10 million subscriber stream and decided that the only way to be happy continuing
[5728.44 → 5732.44] doing this is if I was doing it because I wanted to do it.
[5732.44 → 5733.84] And so that's why I'm doing it.
[5733.84 → 5736.84] Um, I don't...
[5736.84 → 5738.84] I don't really...
[5738.84 → 5741.84] I don't really see a path to that changing.
[5741.84 → 5744.24] I mean, there's absolutely things that are frustrating.
[5744.24 → 5745.84] There's absolutely things that...
[5745.84 → 5748.84] I mean, I messaged Luke the other day.
[5748.84 → 5754.84] Did I send you a screenshot where I, like, circled, uh, where I circled a bunch of videos
[5754.84 → 5755.84] that were performing well?
[5755.84 → 5756.84] Maybe...
[5756.84 → 5758.84] Maybe I didn't actually send this to you.
[5758.84 → 5759.84] I don't think so.
[5759.84 → 5765.04] But I took a... I took a screenshot earlier this week when I circled the videos that
[5765.04 → 5768.24] were performing well over the last 60 seconds.
[5768.24 → 5769.64] I know we talked about this.
[5769.64 → 5770.44] I don't know if it...
[5770.44 → 5773.64] You actually technically sent me a screenshot, but you would have screen shared or something.
[5773.64 → 5774.64] We definitely talked about it.
[5774.64 → 5775.84] Yeah, no, here it is.
[5775.84 → 5777.04] This is not the circled version.
[5777.04 → 5778.64] This is the unaltered version.
[5778.64 → 5784.04] But I looked at, like, a last 60 minutes, um, real-time view counter.
[5784.04 → 5785.04] This is weird.
[5785.04 → 5789.64] And, um, one of them was our most recent release.
[5789.64 → 5792.84] Number two was our second most recent release.
[5792.84 → 5795.44] Number three was our third most recent release.
[5795.44 → 5798.04] Number four was the WAN show from that week.
[5798.04 → 5800.04] So far, so good.
[5800.04 → 5802.84] Then it goes completely off the rails.
[5802.84 → 5805.84] Number five was a YouTube short from January.
[5805.84 → 5812.24] Number six was the WAN show from Computer of the previous year.
[5812.24 → 5814.44] Number seven is Scrapyard Wars.
[5814.44 → 5818.04] Number eight is building a PC in a random tech mall, both of which kind of make sense.
[5818.04 → 5819.44] Those have staying power.
[5819.44 → 5822.64] Then there's another ancient short.
[5822.64 → 5825.44] Dan's Cable Management one, which was also recent.
[5825.44 → 5827.44] Then there's an old short.
[5827.44 → 5828.44] Then there's a new short.
[5828.44 → 5830.44] Then there's a live stream.
[5830.44 → 5833.44] I pray this computer sucks because I'm going to sell it for a dollar.
[5833.44 → 5837.64] A live stream GOD from over a year ago.
[5837.64 → 5838.64] Yeah.
[5838.64 → 5841.64] Then two more ancient WAN shows.
[5841.64 → 5845.64] Ancient WAN shows have some like really weird...
[5845.64 → 5847.64] How can there ever be...
[5847.64 → 5848.64] What did it work out to?
[5848.64 → 5849.64] Four streams.
[5849.64 → 5851.64] No, no, yeah, no.
[5851.64 → 5860.44] Five stream Gods, four of which are WAN shows that are the most viewed videos in a given hour.
[5860.44 → 5865.44] It's like the most evergreen stuff is the stuff that should be the least evergreen.
[5865.44 → 5866.44] Yeah!
[5866.44 → 5868.44] It's actually genuinely completely backwards.
[5868.44 → 5873.44] And the reason I'm talking about this right now is, you know, you ask in this fast-paced,
[5873.44 → 5876.44] fast-paced, you know, frustrating competitive industry.
[5876.44 → 5882.44] It's like, yeah, because a lot of the time the signals that we get for what to keep doing,
[5882.44 → 5884.44] they don't make any sense.
[5884.44 → 5885.44] They're not actionable.
[5885.44 → 5887.44] You know, YouTube will tell us, they tell us make good videos.
[5887.44 → 5892.44] And we're like, okay, and then we'll make something that gets a 99% like-dislike ratio
[5892.44 → 5898.44] and has higher than average click-through and for views it'll perform like garbage.
[5898.44 → 5905.44] And you're like, okay, well, okay, maybe there's just no audience for this, but it kind of seems
[5905.44 → 5909.44] a lot to me like you just, like, didn't put this in front of anybody because the click-through's
[5909.44 → 5913.44] good and the retention's good and the like-dislike ratio is good, and the comments are good.
[5913.44 → 5916.44] Every signal I have says it's good.
[5916.44 → 5921.44] But then I'm getting a bunch of views on an old live stream, a full four-hour live stream.
[5921.44 → 5924.44] One that has like no current relevance at all.
[5924.44 → 5925.44] Nothing!
[5925.44 → 5927.44] Like the year plus old WAN shows.
[5927.44 → 5933.44] It was crazy for me when I would leave autoplay on YouTube, and it would start playing an old WAN show GOD.
[5933.44 → 5935.44] I've shown this to a bunch of people, actually.
[5935.44 → 5937.44] Have I talked about this on WAN show before?
[5937.44 → 5939.44] All the broken old WAN show Gods?
[5939.44 → 5940.44] Yeah.
[5940.44 → 5941.44] I've talked to you about this, right?
[5941.44 → 5942.44] Yeah.
[5942.44 → 5945.44] So old WAN show Gods, most of them are actually functionally broken.
[5945.44 → 5948.44] No, I don't know about most, but definitely some are.
[5948.44 → 5955.44] I mean, the last time I tried to do this, I looked up, I think, WAN show 2014 and just clicked on the first one that came up, and it was broken.
[5955.44 → 5960.44] Yes, that's super random chance, but if it's old enough, I think...
[5960.44 → 5965.44] Can we talk for a moment about just how broken search is on YouTube right now?
[5965.44 → 5973.44] Sorry, this is an impromptu topic here, but I have not been able to find anything at all on YouTube lately.
[5973.44 → 5979.44] Something that was frustrating for me even is we just talked about Humphrey leaving Donut.
[5979.44 → 5980.44] Yeah.
[5980.44 → 5981.44] And I tried to look up his channel.
[5981.44 → 5982.44] Yeah.
[5982.44 → 5983.44] Maybe it'll come up now?
[5983.44 → 5986.44] No, it's just like I show speed stuff.
[5986.44 → 5987.44] Okay.
[5987.44 → 5989.44] That's not even the bigger issue to me.
[5989.44 → 5990.44] Here it is.
[5990.44 → 5991.44] Hold on.
[5991.44 → 5992.44] Hold on.
[5992.44 → 5993.44] Hold on.
[5993.44 → 5994.44] No, that's perfect.
[5994.44 → 5995.44] That's perfect.
[5995.44 → 5996.44] But hold on.
[5996.44 → 5997.44] Hold on.
[5997.44 → 5998.44] Here's my bigger issue.
[5998.44 → 6001.44] I'm searching for Linus WAN show Paul because I know when we had Paul on as a guest, that one's corrupted.
[6001.44 → 6002.44] So I wanted to show you guys.
[6002.44 → 6003.44] Yeah, yeah, fine.
[6003.44 → 6004.44] It's a channel.
[6004.44 → 6005.44] Fair enough.
[6005.44 → 6006.44] Okay.
[6006.44 → 6007.44] This channel is live.
[6007.44 → 6011.44] I love that you guys took the thumbnail today while I was just doing my pre-WAN show vegging on my phone.
[6011.44 → 6012.44] Anywho.
[6012.44 → 6013.44] Okay.
[6013.44 → 6015.44] Some community posts.
[6015.44 → 6020.44] What does that have to do with Paul or WAN show?
[6020.44 → 6021.44] Absolutely nothing.
[6021.44 → 6025.44] But I'm pretty sure we would have put his name in the title back then.
[6025.44 → 6026.44] Okay.
[6026.44 → 6028.44] Here's a WAN show from a week ago.
[6028.44 → 6030.44] Here is a flipping ad.
[6030.44 → 6031.44] Sponsor.
[6031.44 → 6032.44] That, oh, you know what?
[6032.44 → 6033.44] You know what?
[6033.44 → 6034.44] No, no.
[6034.44 → 6035.44] Hold on.
[6035.44 → 6036.44] Hold on.
[6036.44 → 6037.44] Okay.
[6037.44 → 6038.44] On this account, I probably haven't.
[6038.44 → 6041.44] But on my account, I have dismissed this Global Coin Network.
[6041.44 → 6042.44] Like, plus the...
[6042.44 → 6043.44] I've dismissed this so many times.
[6043.44 → 6044.44] I've been like, uh-uh.
[6044.44 → 6046.44] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6046.44 → 6047.44] Okay.
[6047.44 → 6048.44] Okay.
[6048.44 → 6050.44] Don't you have YouTube Premium on your personal account?
[6050.44 → 6051.44] Uh...
[6051.44 → 6052.44] No, my work account.
[6052.44 → 6053.44] Oh.
[6053.44 → 6054.44] Yep.
[6054.44 → 6055.44] Okay.
[6055.44 → 6056.44] Okay.
[6056.44 → 6057.44] Keep going.
[6057.44 → 6058.44] I've got Paul.
[6058.44 → 6059.44] WAN show Linus.
[6059.44 → 6064.44] So we had to go this far to find the only thing that matches this.
[6064.44 → 6065.44] Okay.
[6065.44 → 6066.44] We get the channel.
[6066.44 → 6067.44] This is fine.
[6067.44 → 6068.44] Oh my God.
[6068.44 → 6069.44] Another ad.
[6069.44 → 6070.44] We get another Paul WAN show something.
[6070.44 → 6071.44] Another thing that's credible.
[6071.44 → 6072.44] That one's fine.
[6072.44 → 6073.44] That one's fine.
[6073.44 → 6074.44] Okay.
[6074.44 → 6076.44] But here's my problem.
[6076.44 → 6080.44] Depending on what you look for, you might get two or three results.
[6080.44 → 6083.44] Then you get people also what?
[6083.44 → 6084.44] People also what?
[6084.44 → 6085.44] I'm not...
[6085.44 → 6088.44] I am looking for something right now.
[6088.44 → 6092.44] I am not looking for people also watch Lego car racing, whatever.
[6092.44 → 6095.44] Like, yeah, there's WAN shows in here, but these are not the ones I'm looking for.
[6095.44 → 6097.44] They have nothing to do with my search query.
[6097.44 → 6099.44] And then it gets worse.
[6099.44 → 6100.44] There's like...
[6101.44 → 6103.44] Just random for you.
[6103.44 → 6104.44] For you.
[6104.44 → 6105.44] And then this one drives me crazy.
[6105.44 → 6106.44] Previously watched?
[6106.44 → 6108.44] This one often shows up.
[6108.44 → 6110.44] This one often shows up.
[6110.44 → 6111.44] I wonder if that's a kid thing.
[6111.44 → 6112.44] I wonder if that's a kid thing.
[6112.44 → 6113.44] Like...
[6113.44 → 6115.44] As the...
[6115.44 → 6116.44] As the...
[6116.44 → 6117.44] Probably the third header.
[6117.44 → 6118.44] So weird.
[6118.44 → 6119.44] And there'll be a bunch of them.
[6119.44 → 6120.44] And I'm like...
[6120.44 → 6121.44] Oh!
[6121.44 → 6122.44] Previously watched?
[6122.44 → 6123.44] Okay, fine.
[6123.44 → 6124.44] Fair enough, right?
[6124.44 → 6128.44] Because as it happens, I am looking for a video I've previously watched.
[6129.44 → 6132.44] But don't just pick a random video I've previously watched!
[6132.44 → 6135.44] Pick one that has something to do with my search query!
[6135.44 → 6136.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6136.44 → 6137.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6137.44 → 6142.44] Anyway, the point of this was that I wanted to show you guys what a corrupted old WAN show looks like.
[6142.44 → 6144.44] It's a bit of a trip.
[6144.44 → 6145.44] Oh, hey, look.
[6145.44 → 6146.44] It's Hack smith.
[6146.44 → 6148.44] I wonder if 8 Sleep paid him for this.
[6148.44 → 6149.44] I hope so.
[6150.44 → 6151.44] Why do you say that?
[6151.44 → 6152.44] Um, I...
[6152.44 → 6156.44] We've run into some issues recently with former sponsors using our likeness.
[6156.44 → 6157.44] Oh!
[6157.44 → 6160.44] I don't know that 8 Sleep was one of them, but we have run into some issues.
[6160.44 → 6161.44] Is this one not broken?
[6161.44 → 6162.44] Oh, wow.
[6162.44 → 6163.44] It's...
[6163.44 → 6164.44] It's the Chris Drill one.
[6164.44 → 6165.44] This isn't the...
[6165.44 → 6166.44] Oh, shoot.
[6166.44 → 6167.44] I clicked the wrong...
[6167.44 → 6168.44] Did I click the wrong thing?
[6168.44 → 6169.44] Oh, yeah, I did.
[6169.44 → 6170.44] I totally clicked the wrong thing.
[6170.44 → 6171.44] Okay, here we go.
[6171.44 → 6172.44] I'm pretty sure this one's broken.
[6172.44 → 6173.44] Remember Racer comes?
[6173.44 → 6174.44] Heck yeah.
[6174.44 → 6176.44] Oh, no!
[6176.44 → 6177.44] This one...
[6177.44 → 6181.44] I remember when someone disconnected from Racer comes, and it kept playing the audio even
[6181.44 → 6183.44] though they weren't even connected to the service anymore.
[6183.44 → 6184.44] That was crazy.
[6184.44 → 6188.44] We had to get in contact with them and tell them because you could like to hear them talking
[6188.44 → 6189.44] to people in the background.
[6189.44 → 6190.44] It was not good.
[6190.44 → 6192.44] Dude, are the old WAN shows fixed?
[6192.44 → 6193.44] Yeah.
[6193.44 → 6197.44] Because I think we did flag this to YouTube at some point.
[6197.44 → 6201.44] So it's possible that they've gone in, and they've actually fixed this problem.
[6201.44 → 6203.44] That would be pretty cool.
[6203.44 → 6206.44] I did show a YouTube person at Open Sauce.
[6206.44 → 6207.44] So...
[6207.44 → 6208.44] Oh.
[6208.44 → 6210.44] So like, maybe something happened.
[6210.44 → 6217.44] Alright, well, Luke's going to try and look for one of those in the meantime.
[6217.44 → 6219.44] I am going to find another topic.
[6219.44 → 6220.44] We're merch messages, right?
[6220.44 → 6221.44] Aren't we?
[6221.44 → 6222.44] Oh, is that what we're supposed to be doing?
[6222.44 → 6223.44] Found it!
[6223.44 → 6224.44] Boom!
[6224.44 → 6225.44] Boom!
[6225.44 → 6226.44] Boom!
[6226.44 → 6227.44] Boom!
[6227.44 → 6228.44] Boom!
[6228.44 → 6229.44] Boom!
[6229.44 → 6230.44] Boom!
[6230.44 → 6231.44] Boom!
[6231.44 → 6232.44] Boom!
[6232.44 → 6233.44] Boom!
[6233.44 → 6234.44] Boom!
[6234.44 → 6235.44] Boom!
[6235.44 → 6236.44] Boom!
[6236.44 → 6237.44] Boom!
[6237.44 → 6238.44] Boom!
[6238.44 → 6239.44] Boom!
[6239.44 → 6240.44] You're so good.
[6240.44 → 6241.44] You're so good.
[6241.44 → 6242.44] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6242.44 → 6243.44] I'm so good.
[6243.44 → 6244.44] I'm so good.
[6244.44 → 6245.44] You got to be in here.
[6245.44 → 6246.44] Yeah, yeah.
[6246.44 → 6247.44] That's so good.
[6247.44 → 6248.44] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6248.44 → 6249.44] Yeah, yeah.
[6249.44 → 6251.44] I think I've got a bit of an undead vibe over here.
[6251.44 → 6252.44] Yep.
[6252.44 → 6253.44] Yep.
[6253.44 → 6256.44] What messes me up is people these days go to like massive lengths to get this effect.
[6256.44 → 6257.44] Oh, really?
[6257.44 → 6258.44] Yeah.
[6258.44 → 6263.74] it's actually really cool what you can do when you uh like data mosh stuff like this
[6263.74 → 6270.62] this would be so hard to do on purpose yeah and have it look this good like this is sick
[6270.62 → 6277.42] like music video level that's amazing uh all right cool yeah and like there 's's tons
[6277.42 → 6281.64] of these old WAN shows, and they recommend these all the time and there's even like
[6281.64 → 6286.66] every once in a while you look in the comments yeah okay I look in the comments right now and
[6286.66 → 6291.54] this is from two years ago but still top tier YouTube recommendation this WAN shows from 10
[6291.54 → 6297.36] years ago why is there a bunch of comments with upvotes and replies from two years ago
[6297.36 → 6306.16] every once in a while I'll see like I'll see bumps on videos that's why I like to look at that uh 60
[6306.16 → 6310.96] minute view yeah because it will if I see the most oddball stuff that's where I see the weirdest stuff
[6310.96 → 6316.84] sometimes it makes sense like the build with my sister spiked after I talked about my sister
[6316.84 → 6322.84] passing away it was different sister, but people were searching for Linus sister apparently um and
[6322.84 → 6331.58] then oh this is a weird one whatever like AI fuelled site this is had an article about my sister
[6331.58 → 6338.78] passing away um that I found today because I'm going to an event where I needed to submit a picture for a
[6338.78 → 6347.98] badge and as a joke I wanted to put that weird um uh like what am I'm like uh I'm like uh like
[6347.98 → 6354.02] uh uh uh oh man I'm gonna I'm going to have to see if I can, I'm going to have to see if I can find it
[6354.02 → 6364.68] uh it's like the Linus the anime Linus yeah this one oh okay yeah yeah yeah, so I was like
[6364.68 → 6370.26] I bet they wouldn't mind if I put that on a badge at an event so sure, so I was looking for the full
[6370.26 → 6377.02] quality the full quality of this and as I was scrolling just scrolling scrolling scrolling I
[6377.02 → 6381.50] came across a link to this article like their SEO is strong enough that I was searching for
[6381.50 → 6388.96] Linus cartoon girl or something I forget what it was and I came across an article about my sister's
[6388.96 → 6398.66] passing, and so I um it had a picture of my younger sister but then in the AI presumably AI generated
[6398.66 → 6405.20] article it talked about how it was my older sister who was not a public figure and never appeared on
[6405.20 → 6410.98] camera oh so it like had the yeah yeah so like I left a comment on the left a comment on the article
[6410.98 → 6416.54] I'm like I think it's pretty misleading to have a picture of the wrong sister on this I don't think
[6416.54 → 6420.92] anyone's ever going to come across this article I don't think anybody's going to moderate these comments
[6420.92 → 6430.76] but like wow that machine moves so fast dude I couldn't even believe it anyway I'm super excited
[6430.76 → 6435.86] to have that picture on my uh on my event badge they didn't accept it the first time I sent it, and I was
[6435.86 → 6440.88] like oh yeah okay that kind of makes sense but their reason for not accepting it was that the file size
[6440.88 → 6447.32] wasn't big enough, so I was like okay uh ultimately what I ended up doing is just changing it to a bit
[6447.32 → 6451.86] map and sending it again I was like okay this is over a Meg is this good enough they're like yep
[6451.86 → 6457.88] cool because I had just uh snipped it and sent it as just like a PNG I think it's printing on a badge
[6457.88 → 6466.40] who cares it's going to be like this big anyway I love arbitrary rules for things I love breaking
[6466.40 → 6471.92] them I still have that art as my desktop background with the three of us every once in a while it like
[6471.92 → 6476.64] almost jump scares me because it's my desktop background at work so normally all the screens
[6476.64 → 6480.94] are covered yeah okay and then every once in a while like move something I'm like oh yeah that
[6480.94 → 6495.34] not weird um okay Dan hit me hi Sunil and NAD have you considered using water level sensors in your
[6495.34 → 6500.14] reservoirs for your water loops uh yes
[6500.14 → 6509.60] uh I have also considered uh I actually just remembered this I've talked to Jake about it but
[6509.60 → 6517.54] um I've also considered taking the the toilet water level float that we have in the one in
[6517.54 → 6524.52] the server room out because if I had had one of those and had a leak it would have kept dumping water
[6524.52 → 6530.76] into it so uh we have like a whole room water cooling system here at the office as well that
[6530.76 → 6535.42] helps cool our server room um and in order to make sure that we never have to top it up it's got like
[6535.42 → 6543.94] a toilet float in it, and it's hooked up to plumbing um yeah so we should not do that I'd rather lose a
[6543.94 → 6548.30] pump than man it's so cool just like randomly finding things out about this company yeah I know
[6548.30 → 6552.06] right is this the first time you heard of it stop hearing things oh yeah I never heard of that before
[6552.06 → 6559.42] yeah cool that's wild I mean it probably won't leak that's plumbed up to those um, but man would
[6559.42 → 6564.92] it is sick if it did it's plumbed up to those APC like show up to work on Monday things it's just
[6564.92 → 6568.54] like oh man it's weird that there's like water coming out of the front of the building yeah
[6568.54 → 6575.32] yeah yeah what's causing that yeah dog I don't know man you guys wouldn't like it as much if we
[6575.32 → 6580.90] did everything properly I do agree with that yeah actually yeah like wholeheartedly you have to kind
[6580.90 → 6586.98] of cowboy things every once in a while yeah it's its it's more fun I got a lot of good theories by
[6586.98 → 6591.88] the way from the community on what's going on with the corrosion that I was getting in my loop I saw
[6591.88 → 6596.54] there were some pretty cool comments on that there's some stuff that's not right um I saw someone
[6596.54 → 6603.24] asking in chat on a cash uh asks what about the fuel hoses are they using steel mesh reinforcement
[6603.24 → 6609.40] saw that one it's its it's not metal whatever it is its some kind of string of some sort and I
[6609.40 → 6614.76] believe we actually sourced that tubing from a water cooling supplier even though it is fuel line
[6614.76 → 6620.16] hose clearly they validated it at some point I think it was a good comment though because
[6620.16 → 6623.94] like it was something to check yes good idea something to check there were a lot of good comments
[6623.94 → 6630.36] where it was like okay that's actually pretty quick and easy to verify yes um but probably
[6630.36 → 6636.32] isn't the case, but we could look the one that seems the most likely is that there's a grounding issue and
[6636.32 → 6640.80] some kind of current is flowing which would mean that it's not galvanic corrosion, but it would be
[6640.80 → 6649.48] electrolytic corrosion so if there are two devices that are not that are improperly grounded through the
[6649.48 → 6654.46] loop they could be there could be some kind of current flow would that makes would that make the
[6654.46 → 6658.44] hey there's corrosion clearly on the inlet here but not the outlet of the same thing would that make
[6658.44 → 6663.44] that make sense if one of it might was it would be there it would be the nearest thing yeah
[6663.44 → 6670.26] possibly interesting um this is way out of my realm of understanding, but it sounds cool yeah that that's
[6670.26 → 6675.98] the one that makes the most sense to me and uh is also the easiest to execute I mean in the longer term
[6675.98 → 6681.08] what I really want is for all the systems to be air cooled anyway and just have to have a water door
[6681.08 → 6689.94] um, so I maybe the better thing for us to do is just move to the next phase anyway because it's a little
[6689.94 → 6695.50] sooner than you had intended yeah yeah it was always it was always meant to be a stepping stone to doing
[6695.50 → 6700.22] something bigger and better so maybe we should just do that I really like those types of systems
[6700.22 → 6710.10] the next phase being gas uh yeah you should just you just fully immerse everything no
[6710.10 → 6715.00] you already tried to do that, and it didn't go very well
[6715.00 → 6720.82] you know what you guys just do this show
[6720.82 → 6728.68] you turn to the washroom that was pretty good sorry that was pretty good thank you for the setup
[6728.68 → 6733.50] oh man that was sick why is all that crying
[6733.50 → 6743.52] oh man okay um this is really sure no that was covered as a topic he didn't minimize
[6743.52 → 6749.28] no nobodies been minimizing them oh no um I'll save that one for when he's back
[6749.28 → 6752.74] how about one for you Luke this might be interesting for you to target
[6752.74 → 6758.78] I work in Canadian broadcast media how can I convince the higher-ups that avoiding YouTube
[6758.78 → 6764.20] Twitch or other streaming sites is unhealthy for the industry's future I'm bashing my head to get
[6764.20 → 6771.76] them to try it oh that's a good question and probably a very tough situation that you're in
[6771.76 → 6778.94] um I've tried to talk to those type of people before what where am I here I've tried to talk to
[6778.94 → 6784.08] those type of people before, and they can be quite stiff on things um
[6784.08 → 6793.10] can you say the exact job again do you still have it yeah yeah um Canadian broadcast media
[6793.10 → 6799.50] Canadian broadcast media yeah I mean I could I don't know exactly where you're at within that
[6799.50 → 6805.00] um if it's something like news I would point to examples of news organizations in the states
[6805.00 → 6811.66] going on YouTube and finding very extreme success um I would talk about how uh like the youth of
[6811.66 → 6816.36] today isn't necessarily listening to radio because you could be talking about broadcasts in the radio
[6816.36 → 6822.08] sense um or watching traditional TV channels as much anymore so if you want to hit the youth of Canada
[6822.08 → 6825.72] because they're probably more interested in Canadian specific viewership considering it's Canadian
[6825.72 → 6832.46] broadcasting you got to go where the people are um which are a lot of these web platforms also some of
[6832.46 → 6839.84] these web platforms have um like I don't remember what the sections called but often if is there does
[6839.84 → 6843.94] happen to be something interesting happening in Canadian news or Canadian politics or something
[6843.94 → 6850.14] and I go on YouTube will put those types of things in my feed there's a little section
[6850.14 → 6853.38] of like happening near you or something like that I don't remember exactly what it's called
[6853.38 → 6858.10] when I looked in the account here there isn't one, but it's the account for the show so it
[6858.10 → 6863.08] probably doesn't really have a location, or maybe it's located for America or something like that but
[6863.08 → 6869.88] yeah I mean I would point at other examples other success stories of other comparable media that
[6869.88 → 6877.96] are doing the same thing um I would express the ability to hit a wider audience within Canada um and
[6877.96 → 6882.66] and hopefully find some way to prove that it's not really that hard to do because I don't think it
[6882.66 → 6887.74] would be it's not like it's going to cost extra money right no, no it's just another like upload step
[6887.74 → 6893.22] and uploading to web is honestly pretty simple these days, so I absolutely think you should do it
[6893.22 → 6898.72] yeah I think that sounds reasonable yeah Mac the genius said it's not CBC or Radio Canada
[6898.72 → 6904.94] because they already have YouTube yeah I knew that um yeah I'm not 100 sure what they're talking
[6904.94 → 6908.84] about that's why I was that's why I was they said Canadian broadcast media not necessarily the
[6908.84 → 6913.40] Canadian broadcast corporation yeah it's just it's pretty broad we have quite a few
[6913.40 → 6921.58] um what are what would be the CBC would that be called like the flag carrying like I know you
[6921.58 → 6926.56] have flag airlines the flag bearer corporation like bearer media thing where I don't know
[6926.56 → 6935.54] do they have I think the CBC also has a YouTube channel um probably yeah CBC new wait CBC
[6935.54 → 6942.90] the national CBC news YouTube channel they uploaded 18 hours ago they're going for it
[6943.40 → 6951.98] the national massive BC landslide prompts flood fears people are watching live is this literally
[6951.98 → 6960.46] just the news probably a TV show, but it's on YouTube huh I knew TV shows put up clips and stuff
[6960.46 → 6967.64] I didn't think they just put up like an actual like this is the TV show, but it's on YouTube makes
[6967.64 → 6972.44] sense I mean you can rent movies on YouTube yeah I just I haven't personally seen this before this is
[6972.44 → 6977.76] just CBC's the national, but it's just live-streamed oh okay this is a live stream right now oh weird
[6977.76 → 6984.48] it's not a GOD what is uh what is that called uh play out you know that term Luke yeah it's its just
[6984.48 → 6990.36] just play out, but one of the channels is YouTube totally I'm just surprised that's all yeah because
[6990.36 → 6994.92] I don't I don't think I've seen this before god I haven't thought about play out in years now
[6994.92 → 7003.64] um I do not miss broadcast media topic now that your back hex OS update sure true NASA has launched
[7003.64 → 7008.46] it's powered by true NASA initiative where it will partner with various companies to create tailored
[7008.46 → 7013.04] storage solutions for specific use cases and industries its first partner in this initiative
[7013.04 → 7020.46] is Ash tech the creators of hex OS which is intended to make setting up a home server simple and accessible
[7020.46 → 7025.88] for users without IT admin skills Edtech has also or just people that don't want to deal with it
[7025.88 → 7032.12] Edtech has also launched a blog with their first article explaining how hex OS works very basically
[7032.12 → 7037.98] hex OS is built on top of true NASA and provides a simplified UI and guidance for setting up a home
[7037.98 → 7044.12] server that server can be set up using off-the-shelf server hardware custom hardware or even recycled PCs
[7044.12 → 7051.66] Robbie from NAS compares is collecting questions for an upcoming Q&A with john palazzo of Edtech
[7051.66 → 7056.76] which should probably film and launch sometime next week current plan is august the 9th and
[7056.76 → 7064.66] LTT viewers can post questions for Robbie uh here, and then I guess we'll link this oh no it's a
[7064.66 → 7070.38] YouTube community post yeah that makes it easier they can find it on their own um the hex OS beta is
[7070.38 → 7075.28] expected to launch in the third quarter of this year and anyone interested can sign up for updates
[7075.28 → 7084.18] on their website do they have a pricing model, yet they have some proposals um so just bringing you
[7084.18 → 7091.66] guys up to speed this is the NAS operating system that um is being that's been founded by a
[7091.66 → 7099.06] couple of former unread employees who um came to me and were basically like here's what we want to do
[7099.06 → 7106.74] I was like oh so muted muted muted uh getting you guys up to speed uh hex OS is the brainchild of a
[7106.74 → 7112.98] couple of former unread employees who came to me after their split and basically were like okay here's
[7112.98 → 7117.92] what we want to do, and I was like oh okay so all the stuff that I've been asking you guys to do for
[7117.92 → 7125.90] years um but like you're going to do it this time, and they're like yes, and I was like all right and they
[7125.90 → 7135.76] were like, but we need money, and I was like okay, so I'm invested in hex OS um and I really hope it
[7135.76 → 7143.80] works but if it doesn't well hey it was the friends we made along the way yeah I really do hope so
[7143.80 → 7151.80] I do believe that even though true NAS wizards uh will often be a little gatekeeper-y about true NAS
[7151.80 → 7157.88] and say well if you don't like true NAS then get good at true NAS um but I do think that true NAS
[7157.88 → 7167.04] is incredibly powerful um it's amazing and it doesn't be not easy for people to use I actually sent uh I sent
[7167.04 → 7173.28] John an email today that's uh that's John from uh Esther I emailed him today I was like
[7173.28 → 7180.06] I found a customer in the wild um it doesn't happen that often because not that many people post
[7180.06 → 7187.38] you know very specifically that they're looking for hex OS but um I found one on our forum
[7187.38 → 7194.00] here it is hi guys I'm an idiot that can't help but break stuff on my NAS
[7194.00 → 7199.66] I'm running true NAS I recently switched over to this distro tried to set up plaques it's broken
[7199.66 → 7208.54] um yep basically oh wow you replied already too uh yeah basically a prime candidate because
[7208.54 → 7215.56] man when you screw up true NAS if you don't really know what you're doing you're better off just
[7215.56 → 7221.16] reformatting yeah and a lot of people probably do yeah and just don't talk about it, I'm really
[7221.16 → 7227.08] excited about it but uh just being transparent with everyone I'm always slightly skeptical and
[7227.08 → 7232.14] skeptical until I see how you making that money you know
[7232.14 → 7240.16] yeah I think I am the weirdest early investor yeah here's a small pile of money please leave
[7240.16 → 7244.90] me I'll see you later yeah they offered me a board seat I was like oh god no oh yeah
[7244.90 → 7254.86] I don't want that please just do good job yeah just try to not suck yeah yeah to your best
[7254.86 → 7264.16] I mostly just want the product yeah yeah exactly I just want it I just want it to be easy I don't
[7264.16 → 7271.32] at the end of the day I don't want to go home and deal with like some never stupid like arcane
[7271.32 → 7275.08] permissions issue uh did I ever tell you that that's the issue I was having with Plex
[7275.08 → 7280.52] it was something to do with one of my VMs which is actually hosted on another machine altogether
[7280.52 → 7286.18] one of my VMs um when it copied data onto the NAS which was on a different machine
[7286.18 → 7295.66] um the data wouldn't copy with the same permissions so my Plex like docker or app or whatever it is I
[7295.66 → 7301.42] don't think it's docker um but my Plex app wouldn't have read permissions to that file even though it had
[7301.42 → 7308.20] read permissions to that directory and like I had the hashtag guys just fix it for me because I was like
[7308.20 → 7315.26] I don't want to do this um it would have taken me hours to go in and command line figure it out
[7315.26 → 7319.10] wait you had them fix it for you yeah well they know Trina's
[7319.10 → 7325.78] wow well I mean John's also a bro so like
[7325.78 → 7333.96] did you up your did you re-up your investment no, no no, no whatever no John wouldn't John would
[7333.96 → 7338.44] have done it for me anyway hmm I'm serious he's he's awesome sounds like you're abusing this
[7338.44 → 7343.84] relationship I'm not abusing anything I'm not abusing anything try to board seat for tech support
[7343.84 → 7349.66] yeah exactly oh that's fine that might be fair enough yeah exactly all right exactly all right
[7349.66 → 7354.64] I'm pretty I am pretty low maintenance I just don't want you to misuse John I'm fighting for
[7354.64 → 7359.98] John here I am not and if I am misusing it, it's coming at the cost to his family not to the
[7359.98 → 7367.02] cost to the product because he did it on the weekend it's uh it's market exploration you know
[7367.02 → 7372.40] and they did actually learn useful things yeah did John send up did did John send a
[7372.40 → 7378.06] proper invoice no I don't need an invoice from him, they learned they actually did learn things
[7378.06 → 7383.38] because it was a really weird edge case you know how I'm the master of edge cases edging you know
[7383.38 → 7389.94] I was thinking if I'm going to get him I'm gonna of course I was one of these
[7389.94 → 7401.06] days I'm going to get him oh boy all right but yes I do know that given our the current state
[7401.06 → 7410.16] of our password manager did you even read my report what are we going to do what don't we do I did but I
[7410.16 → 7418.74] don't know I think that we should just have flow plane just write internal tools' oh we're thinking
[7418.74 → 7421.68] about doing it for that that other one I don't want to talk about this, but you know what I mean
[7421.68 → 7428.40] yeah like we literally just might I think I can't think it's better I think there should be
[7428.40 → 7435.36] like a genuine discussion about just a hundred percent custom because our edge cases here Linus is the
[7435.36 → 7441.90] master and all of his employees are too of finding just these really weird use cases for
[7441.90 → 7446.60] like every tool available the one thing that I'm talking about I genuinely think we are going to
[7446.60 → 7452.46] have to make our own because they're like they all suck everything sucks yeah it's crazy this I'm we're
[7452.46 → 7456.28] not talking about the password manager this is great I know John from Esther actually emailed me a couple
[7456.28 → 7462.84] hours ago um we were discussing uh pricing um oh cool I'm just going to tell you guys I'm gonna I'm gonna
[7462.84 → 7468.18] publicly put pressure on him, I'm going to tell you guys that I'm sorry John I'm leaning on them to
[7468.18 → 7473.94] have a perpetual license option oh dude if they have a perpetual license option I will almost
[7473.94 → 7479.84] certainly be like a first minute buyer it won't be cheap, but they will have a prep but if I get my way
[7479.84 → 7484.80] they'll have a perpetual option for like the best tier I want to make sure they're compensated
[7484.80 → 7489.98] properly I don't mind spending some money on this product it sounds like if it fulfills the things
[7489.98 → 7493.22] that they say it's going to fulfill it sounds like it's going to be a fantastic product it may
[7493.22 → 7497.68] not be possible I don't want another subscription some of what they're doing like especially okay
[7497.68 → 7501.58] if they offered cloud backup or something oh well yeah there's not going to be a perpetual yeah or
[7501.58 → 7508.62] maybe it's an adder for that or whatever the point is some stuff may not be possible with a
[7508.62 → 7513.80] one-time fee yeah you can't, you can't do service things but what I am but what I am pushing for
[7513.80 → 7520.06] is that the the the highest tier of ownership of the product should be available as a perpetual
[7520.06 → 7524.78] license even if they are going like everyone does towards a subscription model for most people unless
[7524.78 → 7528.66] it includes things like off-site back exactly you have to that has to be a subscription anyway so we
[7528.66 → 7533.56] were going back and forth about this and um one of this is just the last line of the email which I
[7533.56 → 7536.94] think is great he goes great input as always looking forward to seeing you on WAN show tonight
[7536.94 → 7540.96] and how much do I need to give you to dye your damn hair back brand
[7540.96 → 7556.24] oh man anyway zorg666 and chat said I'd pay like 400 for a perpetual license to that
[7556.24 → 7562.78] interesting good market research sample size of one, but good market research said 300 to 400
[7562.78 → 7568.62] kind of why I like vex or something it's perpetual yeah, and then they do right but like it's reasonably
[7568.62 → 7573.50] cheap for what it is, but it's you get two years of updates right that's one way that I've seen
[7573.50 → 7576.10] companies gate it this is kind of what they're thinking
[7576.10 → 7588.10] yeah I mean I'd be I'd be pretty happy with that yeah I think they're I think they're being pretty
[7588.10 → 7591.18] that seems pretty reasonable I think they're being pretty reasonable about things
[7591.18 → 7597.30] like I'm probably going to want the yeah but especially with the upper one on their like
[7597.30 → 7605.42] yeah yeah dude, so I'm pretty I'm pretty excited I um it's been really hard to have a solid
[7605.42 → 7609.48] recommendation when creators come to us, and they're like yeah we need to solve our story we have
[7609.48 → 7614.46] everything's on external hard drives, and I'm like you're recommending that they need to
[7614.46 → 7620.18] ask you questions forever yeah which is like oh I don't want to recommend getting good
[7620.18 → 7625.40] yeah because they don't want they got other things to do they do other stuff they're trying
[7625.40 → 7627.50] to grow their channels they're trying to do whatever they don't want to learn this
[7627.50 → 7632.86] yeah freaking thing, but I also don't want them to be stuck with the limitations of something like a
[7632.86 → 7640.24] Synology has right like why are we paying a thousand dollars for a frigging atom okay they're not atom
[7640.24 → 7648.38] anymore but but but basically on that level you know it's frustrating like from my point
[7648.38 → 7653.60] especially if you live somewhere where power is relatively affordable your NAS should basically
[7653.60 → 7659.78] just be your old computer or your two computers old ago like it there's no reason to be using super
[7659.78 → 7666.44] powerful hardware unless you know you need it yeah now they're using ailerons apparently I love how many
[7666.44 → 7674.26] times intel has killed Cameron dude Pentium 2 not Pentium 2 Pentium as well the number of times
[7674.26 → 7677.88] they've killed Pentium and then just been like oh right except for the Pentiums we still have don't
[7677.88 → 7685.66] worry about it, I mean it might be actually dead now I mean yeah uncomfortable laughter yeah
[7685.66 → 7692.82] is Mark Zuckerberg a drug dealer no background on this back in March the Wall Street journal reported
[7692.82 → 7697.72] that meta was under federal investigation in the United States for running ads on behalf of up and
[7697.72 → 7706.30] coming young entrepreneurs aka illicit drug dealers in July the Wall Street journal has reviewed
[7706.30 → 7712.90] meta's ad platform and found they are still serving dozens of ads steering users toward online marketplaces
[7712.90 → 7721.64] for illegal drugs levelling up nice further a review of meta's ad library between March and June by industry
[7721.64 → 7730.76] watchdog the tech transparency project found over 450 similar ads many were quite open about their
[7730.76 → 7738.84] products showing photos of prescription drug bottles piles of pills or even bricks of cocaine at least one
[7738.84 → 7746.60] showed a razor blade and yellow powder spelling out DMT wow the use of photos is most likely to avoid text-based
[7746.60 → 7751.32] machine moderation which meta has increasingly relied upon following significant layoffs to its human
[7751.32 → 7756.04] moderation teams our discussion question here is does meta not deal with this because they don't
[7756.04 → 7759.80] want to or because they can't, and I think we all know the answer to that I'm sure they could if they
[7759.80 → 7767.24] wanted to they're perfectly profitable, but it's better for shareholders if they just use AI cool
[7771.40 → 7780.44] nice speaking of AI fan letters by google AI causing anger an ad for Google Gemini has sparked an unexpected
[7780.44 → 7789.72] amount of passion because it depicts a loving father asking an AI to create a draft letter for his daughter to send to an Olympic athlete
[7792.44 → 7802.76] I hate that so much while some have criticized the ad for promoting laziness and inauthenticity others have argued that this is a relatively
[7802.76 → 7808.04] defensible use case where the AI creates a draft that is personalized
[7809.64 → 7817.32] so the look on your face is so great it's just so disappointing because that's like if you think
[7817.32 → 7823.72] about that type of person like this Olympic athlete receiving a letter from someone's daughter who's your knowing
[7823.72 → 7831.24] watching them do something great and then potentially inspiring them to take very life-altering choices to do something really cool with their life
[7831.24 → 7838.84] and if you think about the letter that they would like to receive it's probably kind of junky kid writing
[7839.80 → 7844.92] with spelling mistakes and maybe a little drawing at the bottom or whatever it's not
[7847.00 → 7852.76] it's not ChatGPT output garbage it's like this is totally this is a terrible use case
[7852.76 → 7861.32] uh others have argued this relatively defensible use case um if you're like super lame maybe uh like i
[7861.32 → 7867.40] don't know like uh yeah using AI as a like an intro inspiration for something that you end up doing in a
[7867.40 → 7874.04] unique way sure and this is like the lamest version of that tell me this would you be mad
[7874.04 → 7881.64] if they used an AI to translate it say this letter was to an athlete who spoke a different language
[7881.64 → 7888.92] I'm not saying they are I'm just saying both okay like sure for your convenience I have included an AI
[7888.92 → 7895.48] translation of my daughter's letter I'm just trying to think if there's any kind of if there's any way i
[7895.48 → 7900.60] can break down this wall that I think seems completely fine though like just here you go
[7900.60 → 7906.44] now you don't have to like Google Translate take a photo of it you can just what if the workflow went
[7906.44 → 7914.52] like this the daughter tells the dad uh what she likes about the athlete the dad pumps it into a
[7914.52 → 7919.16] large language model it's kind of spit something out the kind of reads it to her and then she
[7919.16 → 7926.20] without copying it word for word kind of like you know writes it down or something yeah like it like
[7926.20 → 7932.68] is there if you add another layer of human translation to the help from the AI drafting
[7932.68 → 7939.16] the letter does that help in your mind or like what if it's not obvious the authentic
[7939.16 → 7944.36] junkie words of some kid because that's actually what's happening and that's cool okay good thing it
[7944.36 → 7950.92] doesn't need altering I'm not in its it's in its own right in my opinion that is perfection the flaws
[7950.92 → 7956.44] that are included with the bad writing with the spelling mistakes with the improper sentences all
[7956.44 → 7963.08] that kind of stuff that is the perfection of this particular item I think the only ways that it should
[7963.08 → 7970.92] be altered is to improve potential issues with like you said translation because it's the Olympics it's
[7970.92 → 7975.56] all these different countries there's very likely language barriers which is fine I'm not arguing
[7975.56 → 7981.00] with you, I'm just i I wanted to try to I wanted to try to poke holes in it, you know yeah like see if
[7981.00 → 7986.92] there's seen if there's an angle and I'm not it's fine i just this is such just it's such an
[7986.92 → 7991.48] annoying because like i think one of the biggest people's biggest frustrations with the AI
[7991.48 → 8000.04] stuff going on right now is instead of uh automating and removing uh annoying frustrating
[8000.92 → 8006.92] just work like repetitive work it's not cleaning my dishes, yet it's not doing my laundry, yet it's
[8006.92 → 8012.28] not doing those types of things it's making art it's writing its doing the things that humans like
[8012.28 → 8019.00] like to do generally which is annoying, and then you're applying that all of that frustration everything
[8019.00 → 8024.28] that's been happening replacing artists and musicians and writers instead of doing my laundry you're
[8024.28 → 8029.96] taking that whole concept, and you're boiling it down to like this pure form of adoration of a
[8029.96 → 8036.68] child being impressed by someone at the peak of humanity um, and you're going like let's replace
[8036.68 → 8043.80] that with Sam Altman's wet dream, and it's just it's frustrating so i I get why people are annoyed
[8048.20 → 8054.04] Delhi in float plane chat has been asking like every 10 minutes how do I like my new framework I am
[8054.04 → 8060.84] currently undergoing the Qualcomm snapdragon challenge that video is coming out soon but I'm not using a
[8060.84 → 8066.76] framework laptop right now uh investment disclosure i uh I am using a Qualcomm laptop and
[8069.88 → 8074.12] okay you know what I'm not going to say anything instead I'm going to show okay
[8074.12 → 8080.84] okay
[8080.84 → 8085.00] anyway oh that wasn't the point no
[8087.72 → 8088.12] hold on
[8091.00 → 8093.48] oh this might be a bad demo
[8093.48 → 8104.36] give it a sec I think that Luke doesn't like laundry I mean no i I think any form of like you
[8104.36 → 8109.72] have to do it every day or not every day, but you have to do it very often
[8110.60 → 8116.60] task and there's no there's no like I'm sure someone does but I seriously doubt many people glean
[8116.60 → 8122.36] genuine enjoyment from just like doing the laundry okay here's my demo so just so you guys know I've
[8122.36 → 8124.76] just got the LTT form um
[8127.08 → 8135.24] dun dun dun dun dun dun dun okay so how long has it been doing stuff so I have 67 battery life right now
[8136.92 → 8142.28] in the past it would always just be zero because it would just like turn on in my backpack and oh my
[8142.28 → 8147.00] current laptop is like that yeah I had an I had a one-on-one with someone that lasted for an hour
[8147.00 → 8152.04] all I had open was Google Docs and I just typed into it didn't load videos or anything like that and
[8152.04 → 8157.00] it was near dead by the time I was done my laptop's getting a little old dude I had obs running for
[8157.00 → 8164.60] screen recording and uh or no sorry um no, no sorry I had uh teams I had a video meeting going in teams
[8165.16 → 8170.28] and I got a notification that my battery life was critical, and it had entered power saving mode or
[8170.28 → 8176.76] whatever and like I don't know how long later but basically I just kept going in my video meeting
[8176.76 → 8181.64] and then I just hung around and did some more work and I looked at it and I still had like nine percent
[8181.64 → 8189.48] battery left like oh yeah that's pretty sick amazing like on any machine that I ever had before that
[8189.48 → 8196.44] being in a video call would have just crushed oh yeah what remaining I'd have been like hey i have to go
[8196.44 → 8203.24] pretty soon I got a critical battery warning no I'm I'm I'm loving it uh yeah I'm loving it a lot
[8206.36 → 8213.88] sorry who does laundry once a month top gear float plane chat you've been outed you need to do your
[8213.88 → 8223.80] laundry more often that's a lot of 30 at a minimum 30 pairs of socks 30 pieces of underwear i just
[8223.80 → 8227.88] throw them out and get new ones from Ltd store that's what you should do too just wear them once
[8227.88 → 8235.00] and then buy more of them I would never actually Linus would be very against that yes I would be
[8235.00 → 8242.04] very against that you would that's what I do with my water bottles oh it's dirty just go take
[8242.04 → 8248.04] another one cat west says have you seen technology connections dishwasher video and yeah and I know a lot
[8248.04 → 8253.24] of people like that but I can understand someone wanting to do something well or be informed on how
[8253.24 → 8256.60] to do something that they have to do all the time I don't think that that means that they enjoy it
[8259.00 → 8262.84] I don't think I don't yeah are we talking about the one where he said we're all doing the soap wrong
[8262.84 → 8267.16] yeah I think so I think I watched that one yeah yeah these great videos yeah they're all good but
[8267.16 → 8270.68] that doesn't mean that I want to use my dishwasher any more than I have to yeah, but you want to use it
[8270.68 → 8275.08] right yeah if you're going to use it you want to do the thing right which that's those are different things I want
[8275.08 → 8282.44] on dishwasher so badly but help me do the dishes Mr semester says Bernie formerly from rooster teeth
[8282.44 → 8286.92] said his success was measured by being able to wear a different pair of socks every day of the year
[8286.92 → 8292.60] and never washing them i I don't I don't consider that success i just why is that a good thing i just
[8292.60 → 8298.60] consider that waste imagine you get to the end of the year, and then you have to wash 365 or more pairs
[8298.60 → 8304.52] of socks it's like cool I don't like what do you do better the socks are so small they just go with
[8304.52 → 8311.16] everything else you don't like I just watching the socks has never been an additional burden but
[8311.16 → 8325.64] you'd never do a sock load no more of a boxer man oh man too bad he wasn't taking a drink yeah you
[8325.64 → 8333.00] probably would have got me with that one oh you heard it here first folks it doesn't fit in a sock
[8335.16 → 8337.72] we all knew this why
[8343.24 → 8351.00] uh topic I'm looking for one right now ratings.com has published the results of an accelerated longevity
[8351.00 → 8357.88] test where they ran 100 TVs for over 10 000 hours this is roughly equivalent to typical use for an
[8357.88 → 8364.04] American family over the course of six years it should be noted that that's not quite true running
[8364.04 → 8369.96] something continuously is not necessarily the same as having multiple power on and power off cycles over
[8369.96 → 8375.72] a more extended period of time but if anything it should be an advantage for the TVs that they were run
[8375.72 → 8383.40] continuously instead of being cycled because thermal cycles can be quite, quite hard on electronics one
[8383.40 → 8389.72] consistent result from their testing was that thin edge lit TVs were the most prone to failure and had
[8389.72 → 8396.04] significantly worse longevity than other LCD TVs this is a quote edge lit TVs are inherently prone to
[8396.04 → 8401.96] durability issues including warped reflector sheets cracked light guide plates and burnt out LEDs
[8401.96 → 8407.72] due to concentrated heat I'm not going to give you guys too many more details on this because my point
[8407.72 → 8414.44] is not for you guys to not go watch their video my point instead is for you guys to go watch their
[8414.44 → 8419.56] video because this was one of the most interesting investigations that I've seen into consumer technology
[8419.56 → 8426.52] in quite some time I think they did an outstanding job of it and once you are aware of it you're going to
[8426.52 → 8433.56] see the issues that they identified everywhere in your daily life uh the site is ratings.com which
[8433.56 → 8440.52] for some stupid reason is spelled rtings.com I guess they didn't have um what what
[8440.52 → 8445.16] what would it work 1.8 million dollars to spend on a decent domain I mean at that point in time i
[8445.16 → 8449.16] understand it fair enough and respect it that's that's a joke from earlier on the show if someone
[8449.16 → 8455.56] from ratings is watching come down um man this looks some of the okay no actually you have to go I won't you
[8455.56 → 8459.32] gotta go watch the video but some of the I'm only seconds in and some of the footage from this is
[8459.32 → 8466.20] wild you should go watch it yeah go check that out uh basically if you want to have better longevity
[8466.20 → 8473.00] though if you insist on not watching it uh the TLDR is if you want a better a longer lasting TV you
[8473.00 → 8479.96] should go for something with full array local dimming instead of being edge lit and um and they
[8479.96 → 8485.24] also talked about how there isn't really much of a cost advantage to edge lighting my understanding is it
[8485.24 → 8488.68] used to be that that was quite a bit cheaper but these days it's not it's more about making the
[8488.68 → 8496.52] display thinner, so those thinner edge lit displays have issues um with longevity very cool this is
[8496.52 → 8501.56] some more good news well okay that wasn't perfect news, but this is good news online marketplaces
[8502.52 → 8510.20] according to an U.S. court or the U.S. consumer product safety commission um online marketplaces are
[8510.20 → 8521.40] responsible for dangerous products listed by third parties this is awesome yes finally someone's saying
[8521.40 → 8531.08] hey hello wait maybe well we'll get to it if is you're selling it under your site under your name
[8531.80 → 8535.96] you have to deal with it like you can't just be like oh I don't know someone else put it there
[8535.96 → 8541.48] so the U.S. consumer product safety commission has decided that Amazon has a duty to issue a recall for
[8541.48 → 8549.08] 400 000 potentially dangerous products sold by third-party vendors on its platform between 2018 and 2021
[8549.08 → 8556.60] including highly flammable children's pajamas faulty carbon monoxide detectors and unsafe hair dryers that
[8556.60 → 8564.60] could cause electrocution while Amazon did message these customers the CPC says it did not use the word
[8564.60 → 8570.68] recall and downplayed the severity of the risk saying that the products may fail to meet federal
[8570.68 → 8576.76] standards and could potentially pose a risk Amazon says its actions were sufficient, and it will appeal
[8576.76 → 8583.48] the ruling but I want to see this go all the way to the end I want sites to be responsible for the
[8583.48 → 8589.48] products that they list because when I buy something from a supposedly trusted site like Amazon used to be
[8589.48 → 8595.64] or you know Costco I would say still fairly is now although have they gone marketplace yet
[8596.68 → 8602.44] I actually don't know I'm terrified has costco gone marketplace
[8605.00 → 8609.08] I'm looking let me know guys yeah best buy and Walmart have
[8610.44 → 8615.40] i I have an I wonder what you think about this because I've had this apparently no they haven't
[8615.40 → 8624.04] that I don't think you should be able to sit on the line I think you should have to be a marketplace
[8624.60 → 8629.80] and not sell your own things just facilitate the sale of other people's stuff interesting or be your
[8629.80 → 8636.84] own store because this whole like I go on Amazon and i it's yes they say it, but it's not like in your
[8636.84 → 8639.96] face that I'm buying from somewhere else I go on new egg it's not in your face that you're buying from
[8639.96 → 8645.32] somewhere else like with us for example you can buy a jerry rig everything knife or one of the
[8645.32 → 8650.20] Ludwig's bidets, but it's coming from us, you deal with our customer service it's its we're going to
[8650.20 → 8654.04] warranty it in fairness to them, you do deal with their customer service, and you do deal with them
[8654.04 → 8662.44] for warranty Amazon warranty so if we if we sell some stuff on Amazon don't we only within
[8662.44 → 8667.00] a certain period, but yes people can absolutely return our water bottle or screwdriver to Amazon if
[8667.00 → 8670.92] that's where they bought it oh interesting yep in fact I still don't like it I think you should be
[8670.92 → 8677.40] one or the other in fact these marketplaces leveraging their position as the only access
[8677.40 → 8683.72] that sellers have to their customer base um has led to a pretty interesting situation for
[8683.72 → 8690.60] team you TEM you I always forget how it's pronounced I'm so sorry I don't care, so people are like
[8690.60 → 8696.60] attacking me for saying it wrong I don't shop there I don't see their ads if I do I ignore them I'm
[8696.60 → 8702.84] sorry I don't know team you tell me whatever it is apparently they had um protests at their
[8702.84 → 8711.80] headquarters uh this was a day ago um their sellers are revolting against fines withheld pay
[8713.00 → 8721.24] and uh situations where customers are claiming uh warranty issues and team is basically going okay
[8721.24 → 8726.44] yeah no problem here's your refund and don't bother sending the product back and these
[8726.44 → 8734.36] marketplace sellers are like yo i uh I need, I want that back if they're you know if is it's broken
[8734.36 → 8739.64] or whatever like I need to look at it if is I'm sending the money back I want the product back um
[8740.60 → 8747.16] and yeah it's been it's been a whole it's been a whole thing nice good yeah anyway yeah I thought
[8747.16 → 8751.80] that was pretty interesting chad is talking about my take and like yeah I think eBay is completely fine
[8751.80 → 8757.48] completely because it's very clear what you're doing when you're on that website to me, it's not
[8757.48 → 8761.72] super clear when I'm on some of these other websites a lot of these other websites what's
[8761.72 → 8765.32] actually happening if I'm actually buying this from the store that I'm at or if I'm technically
[8765.32 → 8770.04] buying this from some other store but with eBay have we just been frog boiled more effectively
[8770.04 → 8776.92] because eBay used to be an auction site if you think about it there didn't use to be by it now I don't
[8776.92 → 8783.32] think i now it's a marketplace site yeah, but it's I don't think does eBay sell their own product no
[8783.32 → 8787.24] then yeah I don't care you know what you're getting into when you're there whether you buy it now or you
[8787.24 → 8792.28] auctioned I'm not too worried about it um I'm just saying there definitely was
[8792.84 → 8798.76] a shift in model for eBay, but it's one that you consider I think that's fine because you still know
[8798.76 → 8804.92] you're buying from a massive array of sellers it's very front and centre what the seller is that
[8804.92 → 8809.40] you're buying it from, and you know when you're one bay that you're buying it from a huge range
[8809.40 → 8817.00] apparently eBay always had bought it now I think it wasn't as popular was not aware of that i I mean
[8817.00 → 8822.44] I know that it's basically most of what I see listed these days and I don't think that was the case before
[8823.00 → 8824.20] but that's good to know
[8827.08 → 8832.60] definitely good to know yeah apparently it always had it I know they've had it for a very long time i just
[8832.60 → 8837.08] didn't think they had it at the beginning
[8837.96 → 8838.28] all right
[8841.32 → 8848.28] that's it for topics it's time for after dark yes let's do it after purple yeah after chair
[8848.52 → 8850.76] after do we have an after dark sponsor today
[8853.16 → 8853.80] Dan you're muted
[8855.88 → 8859.00] sorry it's in it's in the dock is it I don't know I can't see it
[8859.00 → 8864.04] um that's because it's an advertisement let's just say I'm dumb yeah nice
[8865.72 → 8871.56] that was a pretty good reference actually uh Pia oh okay after dark is brought to you by private
[8871.56 → 8876.44] internet access, and it'll show up on the banner and things as well nice all right Dan you want to
[8876.44 → 8881.88] hit us with some merch messages yeah just let me switch this banner over and then yeah I've got some
[8881.88 → 8891.24] here let's see purple even though new standards are always more useful and successful and never
[8891.24 → 8896.92] compete with their predecessors uh slash s Linus and Luke what standard would you like to have erased
[8896.92 → 8908.36] from history oh wow uh USB what no it'd be funny no I mean I see what happens every device just uses a
[8908.36 → 8918.92] parallel port from like I mean there are to your phone yeah just this giant port 25 pin d sub kind
[8918.92 → 8927.24] of thing yeah um I definitely do think that there are that there are standards the world would be better
[8927.24 → 8936.28] off without um I don't think that I would go as broad as USB but I think i would delete
[8936.28 → 8945.96] micro USB from history if I could, I think mini b was an um no it wasn't a mini b was b, but it was mini b
[8946.92 → 8955.48] mini b first was much more durable than micro b and second of all at least anecdotally and
[8955.48 → 8962.68] second of all was not that much bigger I found really wasn't much bigger very few devices very few
[8962.68 → 8969.32] devices that had a micro b port on them that couldn't possibly have just had a mini b on them
[8969.32 → 8975.40] instead um and people are saying micro HDMI and mini HDMI yeah those are complete garbage
[8975.40 → 8983.64] town however I wouldn't delete them they have a certain utility whereas micro b my issue with it
[8983.64 → 8989.40] is that I would have rather just used mini b until we made it to USB I really think we could completely
[8989.40 → 8995.56] delete that standard from history and not a lot would have been lost you got anything got a standard
[8995.56 → 9001.80] that you would eliminate adobe flash jk adobe flash served a purpose I really liked it when it
[9001.80 → 9008.60] was also macro media flash yeah yeah yeah before it was adobe flash I don't know there's a lot of
[9011.32 → 9015.32] I feel like I feel like most standards like i I completely agree with you on the micro b thing
[9015.32 → 9023.24] but I feel like most standards are just suffering from the xkcd let's there are too many standards let's
[9023.24 → 9027.16] add a standard so that we can just have one standard and then there's one more standard
[9027.72 → 9032.76] um I don't think most standards are necessarily actually that bad like the fact that HDMI and
[9032.76 → 9038.12] DisplayPort have to coexist yeah I understand there are features that one has, and the other doesn't but
[9038.12 → 9044.92] the fact that we keep propping up HDMI at this point when it really doesn't do much that DisplayPort
[9044.92 → 9051.00] doesn't already do or couldn't do, and it has a license fee associated with it when DP doesn't I
[9051.00 → 9059.80] just couldn't we put copy protection over dp I believe it can be done yeah yeah why yeah
[9062.28 → 9066.20] yeah I don't know maybe HDMI I don't know I just find I find most standards like
[9066.92 → 9073.16] I don't know you could get rid of the vast majority of them um and there would be something
[9073.16 → 9077.48] USB is kind of funny because not really, but you could get rid of the mass vast majority of
[9077.48 → 9081.48] standards and there's probably some other standard that's probably fine I mean we could have all used
[9081.48 → 9081.96] FireWire
[9086.84 → 9092.60] iambus I mean iambus things though is like even with FireWire if it kept being developed until now
[9093.72 → 9099.96] maybe FireWire 4 or whatever maybe it would be fine titan storm has the best one rj11
[9099.96 → 9107.88] we could have just never had rj11 and then everywhere that was ever wired for a phone line
[9107.88 → 9113.16] could just be rj45 and could be useful for networking today now that landline phones are dead
[9113.80 → 9118.84] if we had just not had rj11 the world would be a better place today I like that I like that that's
[9118.84 → 9125.80] a good one you win yeah pretty good you won yeah mini disc nah mini disc is a fun curiosity
[9125.80 → 9132.44] yeah I don't know we don't need to get rid of it yeah yeah uh let's see hi Linus been playing beat
[9132.44 → 9137.80] safer about two months now what levels are your favourite at what settings and do you have any tips
[9137.80 → 9147.40] for moving from hard to expert also my friend Micah says love you LLD. Wan uh the biggest tip is uh that
[9147.40 → 9153.88] instead of moving your arms uh which is slow because your arms are heavy and have a lot of inertia
[9154.44 → 9159.40] um you need to twist your arms this is faster than this
[9161.88 → 9171.32] maybe more painful to start um what is it tipping to tip yeah yeah exactly and inside out and uh whatever
[9171.32 → 9178.68] encoding uh anyway compression um so, so yeah you need to you need to learn to pronate and supinate
[9178.68 → 9183.16] this was very difficult for your arm but I got a lot better once i kind of figured it out I was never
[9183.16 → 9189.16] that great at it but yeah I got a lot better I had better luck with the Oculus Rift controllers than
[9189.16 → 9194.84] the index controllers because they were lighter and the centre of mass was closer to the wrist do you
[9194.84 → 9198.84] have any tips for improving index controller grip uh you can also you can look up grips
[9200.92 → 9207.00] no, no it's uh it's mostly just the mass of them and their ability to rotate in space no man it's
[9207.00 → 9215.00] it's totally a thing um hold on I was just trying to razz you uh no this is the wrong one uh basically
[9215.00 → 9221.16] there 's's like guides for all the different like grips that you can have and stuff oh no this
[9221.16 → 9225.80] dude this is a whole oh yeah it's totally this is a whole thing I've been trying to find
[9225.80 → 9232.12] those myself actually and yeah i kind of do similar things to some of those it's a whole rabbit I should
[9232.12 → 9237.40] look that up because my ability to play just absolutely tanked to nothing after I got the uh
[9237.40 → 9244.52] index man try playing with the old five wands oh yeah those are freaking heavy they're tough so people
[9244.52 → 9251.64] would like to put their fingers like through the hole um, and then they'd like to hold it like that so that
[9251.64 → 9257.08] the centre of gravity was different still can't find the buttons get your mind out of the gutter
[9261.00 → 9268.36] oh man okay uh let's see getting this to replace one that fell off my motorbike and got crushed when
[9268.36 → 9273.48] riding from Glasgow to Lisbon sorry what are you buying they bought a 40 ounce water bottle nice
[9273.48 → 9280.52] and Atlantic blue LOD what is the most important thing you've lost while riding or your bike or
[9280.52 → 9289.88] travelling oh man did I tell the story of how I left not one but both of my luggages on a bullet train
[9289.88 → 9298.20] when I was in Japan oh I have a vague memory of this, but they probably don't know uh oh wait no I think
[9298.20 → 9303.40] I think I did I think I did okay yeah well basically I got it back thank you japan I'm not
[9303.40 → 9307.64] too surprised and culture of honesty and efficiency I got it back in a couple of hours and I managed to
[9307.64 → 9314.04] make my flight wow yeah I'm not surprised you got it back I'm a little surprised you got it back like
[9314.04 → 9322.44] with haste it wasn't super hasty remind me sometime to send you the completely unhinged chat history that
[9322.44 → 9327.96] I have with Yvonne while I was waiting for the lost and found okay it was not moving fast and I was
[9327.96 → 9333.72] very stressed out because I had a flight to make that I literally made by one minute oh ultimately
[9333.72 → 9340.04] yeah it was crazy it was one of the most wild experiences of my life um but anyway I ended up
[9340.04 → 9344.84] like rushed off the train and I was like oh I grabbed my backpack and go and i just completely left them in
[9344.84 → 9350.44] the top which where I wouldn't normally put things like i because you know because i know what I'm
[9350.44 → 9356.52] like yeah um anyway the worst sort of tech thing while travelling and I think the way that
[9356.52 → 9362.04] you're asking was when I put my laptop on top of my car as I was getting into it and then drove to
[9362.04 → 9371.64] school I took notes with paper that day yeah I drove to school from surrey to UBC it could have been
[9372.52 → 9380.04] anywhere literally anywhere i I've I'm I'm very like once an item is put down yeah
[9380.44 → 9386.36] I think my memory of it is temporarily removed yeah I don't know that you have no like what's
[9386.36 → 9391.32] it called like uh content permanent object permanence yeah I guess yeah pretty much if
[9391.32 → 9397.32] I put something on my car now I put it on the driver's side windshield yeah that's my hack yeah
[9397.32 → 9402.44] i I've got things like i I have better habits when I travel it's something that honestly frustrates me
[9402.44 → 9406.60] in general because I'm like I wish I could keep these things up when I'm not travelling but I better have
[9406.60 → 9411.40] it's when I travel and one of those things is I will just tie things to myself so like if I'm on
[9411.40 → 9417.24] a train and I put my bag down I'll just tie it to my leg I'm perfect with my backpack I didn't
[9417.24 → 9422.92] forget my backpack but part of the problem for me on that trip probably like the physical memory was I
[9422.92 → 9432.36] had spent the trip there and going around everywhere in Japan with my family so I didn't have because what
[9432.36 → 9438.04] I'll do is i I count I'll count how many items I'm supposed to have with me three three three three
[9438.04 → 9444.76] two three so that's how I keep things with me, but there had been no consistent grunt of recognition
[9447.32 → 9449.80] number phone
[9454.12 → 9459.80] but there'd been no consistent number on that trip right like no I'm the same way about my phone my
[9459.80 → 9465.40] my number of things that are supposed to be in my pants is four yeah don't ask me what the extra one
[9465.40 → 9474.92] is you can forget that um I mean I would if it wasn't attached to me um so yeah my number of
[9474.92 → 9478.92] things that's supposed to be in my pants is four and I have designated pockets where everything goes
[9478.92 → 9482.60] and if for whatever reason I put something in a different pocket i lose it I'm like
[9482.60 → 9493.00] you know um anyway what'd you lose oh I've lost a bunch of stuff I don't know i I think there's
[9493.00 → 9501.56] there's one time on the plane I forgot my wallet in Uber one time um dude was super helpful came back
[9501.56 → 9507.40] it was great um I left the phone on the plane as you know um there 's's been yeah there's been a
[9507.40 → 9512.52] bunch of different things I lose sweaters all the time I don't when I travel I still take a sweater
[9513.00 → 9518.44] because I like doing the like I put it on backwards on the plane and get like a dark
[9518.44 → 9522.04] environment so I can sleep more easily is that more of a front and pull the whole thing tight so
[9522.04 → 9527.32] I can have my gigantic snorkel of a nose sticking out of it so I can breathe more easily but yeah
[9527.32 → 9534.60] yeah it's good too i but i unless I like really need it I will not take it out of the hotel room
[9535.40 → 9540.28] because I'm like it'll it's gone I leave sweaters at friends houses all the time yeah it's like
[9540.28 → 9545.08] it's bad you've never left one at mine what are you saying I'm pretty sure I have no I'm just I'm like
[9546.20 → 9554.12] rather certain um but I don't know Ben Mitchell goes wow I never noticed Linus's nose until now
[9554.12 → 9562.04] stop bringing it up sad I never thought it was that big yeah but I mean
[9562.04 → 9572.04] okay next one oh man
[9575.96 → 9583.40] hey low density lipoprotein LDL question for Linus would you ever do an interview with hank green I'd
[9583.40 → 9588.28] love to hear your thoughts on each other's business practices as successful YouTube creators
[9588.28 → 9594.36] I mean sure I don't I don't interview people but if I was going to interview someone sure why not
[9594.36 → 9603.56] hank green seems like an absolute chad yeah let's see hey daddy Linus I was recently featured in a mean
[9603.56 → 9611.32] comments video please tell jams I'm sorry he is not in fact menace that I think the term you're looking for
[9611.32 → 9619.08] as menace I did uh bleep the word when i said that verbal bleep I like it oh just for just
[9619.08 → 9625.32] for you guys, so there's no it's kind of how I sing along with rap songs you just leave a gap yeah
[9625.32 → 9626.04] that's the safest
[9628.76 → 9634.44] yeah, yeah pretty much, or you could just not sing along much no, no I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay you know
[9635.40 → 9639.96] violence and disrespecting women and all that kind of stuff I'll sing along with that, but there's
[9639.96 → 9649.88] certain things I draw a line I drive a Chevrolet movie theatre um please tell jams I'm sorry yeah
[9649.88 → 9656.28] yeah uh do you have any concerns about videos like that encouraging toxic comments um
[9658.44 → 9665.96] no not really it doesn't it doesn't really seem to go up or down I think most people have a pretty
[9665.96 → 9670.76] good sense of humour and have a pretty healthy relationship with their consumption of our
[9670.76 → 9677.96] videos it just is like a very, very small minority of frankly kind of unhinged people that have taken
[9677.96 → 9682.44] the whole par asocial relationship thing whether it's with us or whether it's with like a tech brand that
[9682.44 → 9688.44] they Stan or whatever else it is and have just gone off the deep end with it um if it's still
[9688.44 → 9697.48] I think you see a lot of it in tech just because how do I put this um respectfully I think uh yeah
[9697.48 → 9701.08] this was buried what two and a half hours into a win show it's probably fine what's happening you
[9701.08 → 9707.40] see a lot of this in tech right where i think that a lot of us ended up into computers and
[9707.40 → 9715.80] technology because we struggled socially right um like I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna dance around this
[9715.80 → 9720.36] right like that was a big part of what was appealing about it to me so I think it's natural
[9720.36 → 9726.12] that we end up with um some people in the tech community maybe disproportionately so that have kind
[9726.12 → 9732.92] of uh um some challenges when it comes to sort of social understanding and social interactions right so
[9733.80 → 9738.28] um it's totally a thing it's totally a thing I don't think that even needs to be like buried in a
[9738.28 → 9743.40] way and show, but it's its not and overwhelming it's not an overwhelming majority and no and a lot of the
[9743.40 → 9750.04] social difficulties aren't harmful yeah yeah it's just it's just the handful that you know right temple
[9750.04 → 9755.96] OS um you know like well we had some challenges right yeah
[9760.12 → 9767.16] hi Wanda deal what are your thoughts on home theatre setups talking full av receivers for pcs I've
[9767.16 → 9772.44] been looking for an option, but it appears none support 21 by 9. and this is yet another reason that
[9772.44 → 9777.40] HDMI is such a weird stupid standard like why does it only support certain resolutions and
[9777.40 → 9785.64] certain implementations why does it matter who cares um it's not it's not entirely due to HDMI it
[9785.64 → 9791.48] actually has to do with the implementation obviously it'll work at 21 by 9 on your computer with a HDMI
[9791.48 → 9797.56] cable um but it is it's its just been an it's been a that's just you've you've hit a trigger for me
[9797.56 → 9803.40] that's really frustrating that av receivers won't just pass through whatever resolution who cares
[9803.40 → 9812.12] as long as there's enough bandwidth why does this matter um yeah so you don't have the the thing though is
[9812.12 → 9818.20] that you don't have to go through your receiver for the video like you could just um you can just use
[9818.20 → 9824.20] the av receiver with um you can just use the av receiver for audio and then have a separate cable
[9824.20 → 9828.12] go out to your display so that's probably what I would do if you want to if you want to use home
[9828.12 → 9832.60] theatre speakers and an av receiver which I actually did for a long time I had an on cue receiver in
[9832.60 → 9840.68] these um who made the speakers anyway wow how do I know oh Jeff yeah that's an I had like Jeff um
[9840.68 → 9844.92] satellite speakers it was kind of a sick setup at my girlfriend's parents house
[9847.48 → 9853.00] imagine having a sick audio the speaker based audio setup I know right that is just your girlfriend's
[9853.00 → 9859.40] parents I know what level of like face is that, but that's another angle I like that no that's just
[9859.40 → 9867.40] so that sofa that's so chad but is it brat yeah I think so I don't even know it might be beyond
[9867.40 → 9873.88] brad I think if your parents had a sick audio system at your house like your girlfriend's parents had one
[9873.88 → 9879.64] at your house that would probably be brad that would be that would be super weird why would they do
[9879.64 → 9886.20] that why would they have that yeah just because you're that brat Dan I don't I don't know if you
[9886.20 → 9891.48] understand what brad is I don't either though yeah me neither so sure why not yeah sure yes it's brad
[9893.40 → 9899.80] yeah it's quite okay uh moving on I think before we go I think that might be the show for today
[9901.72 → 9906.44] yeah sure really appreciate you guys tuning in we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[9906.44 → 9916.28] bye
[9923.08 → 9924.60] oh you might have to cut back to me
[9927.56 → 9934.20] this is hilarious uh john from ash tech messaged me 35 minutes ago he's like all right man go ahead
[9934.20 → 9940.76] and confirm we'll do a perpetual option don't say prices yet though i you didn't you didn't
[9940.76 → 9944.60] technically confirm that they were going to do it but no he says go ahead and do it though oh okay yeah
[9944.60 → 9949.80] yeah yeah yeah oh yeah so now it's done I love it all right that pretty much guarantees I'll be
[9949.80 → 9954.12] using it personally all right cool I'm not an investor
[9954.12 → 9956.92] oh
[9957.80 → 9962.44] you can't do it twice what if I say bye-bye what if this precedent we can't bye-bye
[9968.28 → 9972.28] what that's going to do there might be music playing over music we'll find out
[9972.28 → 9976.28] you
