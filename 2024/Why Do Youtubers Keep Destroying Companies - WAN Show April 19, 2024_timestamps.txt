"You won't click this notification." That's correct. I don't enable the bell... but I have the "Home" and "Shorts" pages of youtube *blocked like they were ads*. I only use the Subscriptions page. I *will* see every video posted by the people I actually care to see more content from. I find new channels by word of mouth, not whatever swill the algorithm wants to shovel into my face.

On the other hand, I have any video tile with the "Live!" indication also blocked like an ad, so I *really* wish you guys would get off your ass and start putting the timestamps *AND ARTICLE/SOURCE LINKS* in the video description, instead of crowdsourcing that shit to the comment section. You can't possibly convince me you can't afford for someone to spend 30 minutes per episode taking care of that.
