[0.00 --> 3.84]  What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show. We got a great show for you guys this week.
[4.46 --> 10.16]  ASUS apologizes for their strange and expensive repair quotes.
[10.56 --> 13.84]  What was our headline today? I forget. Something like...
[13.84 --> 15.76]  The Apple undeletes your news.
[15.78 --> 21.72]  Oh yeah! iPhones are undeleting old photos even on devices that have been wiped?
[22.18 --> 24.06]  What? What else we got going on this week?
[24.06 --> 33.18]  Microsoft announces Proteus Controller, another controller that helps you have inputs if you have difficulty with standard controllers.
[33.66 --> 44.18]  And also there's a live service MMO game that is going offline into a single player slash co-op game and is removing all of their microtransactions.
[44.70 --> 46.64]  Well that last part sounded good.
[46.80 --> 47.06]  Yeah.
[54.06 --> 69.14]  Squarespace!
[69.94 --> 70.30]  Ah...
[70.30 --> 71.18]  Ahrefs.
[71.70 --> 73.14]  And uh...
[74.26 --> 75.62]  Uh oh.
[76.22 --> 76.78]  Magical!
[77.44 --> 80.64]  I take one bite of food and you guys...
[80.64 --> 81.64]  Just, you know...
[81.64 --> 84.92]  Those are our sponsors you guys. They're our sponsors.
[84.94 --> 86.46]  You trying to blame me for not doing your job?
[91.12 --> 94.68]  iPhones have been undeleting old news.
[95.14 --> 98.30]  Many users, and this has been reported by The Verge and MacRumors,
[99.12 --> 110.60]  many users are reporting old, long deleted photos are resurfacing on their iPhones as if they were recent photos following Apple's 17.5 iOS update.
[110.60 --> 120.42]  This includes devices that were previously wiped, resulting in embarrassment for at least one user who wiped their device before selling it to a friend,
[120.42 --> 122.26]  only to have...
[122.26 --> 126.12]  revealing photos reappear on the device.
[126.12 --> 144.00]  It is unclear at this time whether this is an indexing bug or a synchronization issue with iCloud, but many have reported finding long, long deleted photos, including sexual images, meaning that this is unlikely to be a problem with recent photos being inappropriately retained.
[144.00 --> 146.00]  Wow!
[146.00 --> 147.00]  Wow!
[147.00 --> 149.00]  Is there ever a lot to unpack here?
[149.00 --> 151.00]  And I would like to preface this by saying,
[151.00 --> 154.00]  look, this is not unique to Apple.
[154.00 --> 170.40]  This particular incident is uniquely happening to Apple, but this whole issue where cloud providers are not actually f***ing deleting something when you press the delete button is a widespread issue.
[170.52 --> 173.72]  Now, in some cases, this is a feature more than a bug.
[173.72 --> 188.72]  For example, I don't think we're doing a Backblaze read this week, but one of the things that we mention whenever we talk about one of our sponsors, Backblaze, is that for a fee, you can actually extend their data retention when you delete something.
[188.72 --> 191.72]  And the idea is that it's a recycle bin.
[191.72 --> 202.56]  Which if you've ever sent an email and then been like, oh, wait, and then clicked the undo thing or whatever because you missed all the word or did something wrong like that, having an undo can often be quite nice.
[202.56 --> 212.12]  And in the context of something like Backblaze, where the things that especially B2B customers are backing up to their service could be mission critical.
[212.40 --> 213.56]  And that is it.
[214.30 --> 215.66]  That's their off-site backup.
[215.66 --> 229.80]  The ability to, you know, undo an accidental control A delete or even in some cases a malicious deletion of off-site backups could be absolutely critical.
[230.06 --> 241.46]  But in the case of services where it is being communicated to you that when you delete something that it is gone.
[243.46 --> 245.14]  Oh, man, this is challenging.
[245.14 --> 249.04]  Now, now, something that we don't know, right?
[249.08 --> 251.62]  Because this is saying old long-deleted photos, right?
[251.68 --> 259.70]  Something that we don't know is were these photos, are these photos on another iDevice somewhere?
[260.16 --> 263.78]  Are they synchronizing to iCloud through that?
[263.88 --> 272.62]  And then is this simply a case of the device ID somehow not being unlinked correctly from that iCloud account?
[272.62 --> 276.66]  Like, there's a number of different ways that this could transpire.
[276.66 --> 301.26]  But the bottom line is that this is a broad issue where cloud providers are, A, not deleting things that you mark delete necessarily, and not managing that data in a way that is adequate, I guess is the word that I'm looking for.
[301.26 --> 301.70]  Yeah.
[302.22 --> 311.18]  So, what I want to know, okay, our discussion question here is, is this a temporary bug or is it indicative of a deeper issue with information storage that needs to be addressed?
[311.32 --> 313.44]  I mean, absolutely the second one.
[313.76 --> 313.90]  Yeah.
[313.90 --> 321.62]  But what I want to know is, what is the liability here? And when are these companies going to answer for these things?
[321.86 --> 330.22]  Yeah, because, like, I mean, there's the, there's the, there's the sexual images angle, which is, I think, like, the main one that's coming up, especially in the articles that we're seeing.
[330.26 --> 331.60]  But what about just the privacy?
[331.60 --> 336.78]  There's privacy issues. There's privacy issues. There's photos that might be relatively traumatic to people.
[337.10 --> 337.42]  Yeah.
[337.56 --> 345.90]  They might not want coming back. They deleted for a freaking reason. And having that put, like, you know, front and center in front of them can be pretty frustrating and annoying.
[345.90 --> 372.88]  And, I mean, oh, man, like, here's, here's, here's what I want to know. Like, Apple is a company that purports to take privacy very, very seriously. How exactly is it that this data wouldn't be stored in an encrypted fashion? And if it gets synchronized to a device, how would that be decrypted without account level authentication?
[372.88 --> 378.44]  I mean, tell, tell me, you know more about this kind of stuff than I do.
[378.50 --> 380.02]  It's not necessarily stored in an encrypted fashion.
[380.04 --> 380.72]  Well, why not?
[381.94 --> 385.22]  It's more difficult. And if they feel like they don't need to, just like, who cares?
[387.26 --> 388.96]  That's not a good response, brother.
[389.10 --> 396.10]  I'm not saying that's the truth, either. I have no idea. I'm just saying it's not, I don't, I don't necessarily know that they're stored in an encrypted fashion.
[397.42 --> 402.00]  Like, photos on iOS. Do they back up to iCloud?
[402.88 --> 404.36]  We might be able to figure this out.
[404.36 --> 405.46]  I mean, if you pay for iCloud, sure.
[405.68 --> 408.28]  So if you don't pay for iCloud, then it's, who knows?
[408.34 --> 414.52]  Theoretically, yeah, you're only your five gigs are going to back up. And then that, yeah, that should be all that's synchronized to iCloud.
[414.70 --> 421.98]  Like, even with the, that, that huge celebrity image leak, like, that was all things that people were storing in iCloud.
[421.98 --> 426.92]  There was no way to, to get something that was locally stored off of a device off of it.
[427.54 --> 436.06]  It was, it was all through, I believe that was mostly through authentication theft and third parties getting access to people's iCloud accounts.
[436.06 --> 444.60]  Mm-hmm. I'm not 100% certain. It says your iCloud data is encrypted. The encryption keys are secured in Apple data centers where we can help you with data recovery.
[445.08 --> 447.58]  And only certain data is end-to-end encrypted.
[448.20 --> 452.20]  But I don't think we're talking about an end-to-end encryption scenario.
[452.42 --> 452.50]  Right.
[452.50 --> 454.28]  Like, this isn't being grabbed part way.
[454.28 --> 472.44]  So, I mean, why, why, okay. Obviously, there's a, there's a computational cost, right? But with how, with how, with how many accelerators we have in modern devices, don't you feel like...
[472.44 --> 475.48]  End-to-end encryption, I can understand not wanting on everything. That can get pretty annoying.
[475.48 --> 484.90]  But, um, the, the encryption in general, which it says it has, to be fair, on iCloud, um, that's not that bad. And they say that they have it. So that makes sense to me.
[485.32 --> 490.58]  Um, how it would be unencrypted, like, did they, did they log out of everything before they sold this device to their friend?
[490.70 --> 492.90]  To be clear, when he says unencrypted, decrypted.
[493.24 --> 493.56]  Yeah, yeah.
[493.56 --> 494.76]  How it would be decrypted.
[494.88 --> 495.16]  Yeah, yeah.
[495.24 --> 500.48]  Well, I mean, theoretically, when you wipe an iPhone, it's wiped. So the only way that...
[501.08 --> 501.92]  Did they do that, though?
[502.40 --> 503.26]  They said they did.
[503.32 --> 503.84]  They said they did.
[503.84 --> 506.02]  And it, and I mean, realistically...
[506.02 --> 506.66]  I don't know, man.
[507.78 --> 512.84]  Um, oh, I mean, no, I, this kind of checks out, because, how could you...
[513.80 --> 514.42]  Okay, so...
[514.42 --> 521.08]  Your friend would have to log into their iCloud account. You can only be logged into one iCloud account at a time on an iPhone, from my understanding.
[521.32 --> 527.02]  So as soon as your friend logged into their iCloud account, anything that was synchronized with the old iCloud account should be gone.
[529.00 --> 532.00]  I would like to think so. I mean, I don't know how this stuff works.
[532.00 --> 534.58]  So, like, commenting on it is a little bit difficult.
[535.58 --> 547.38]  Handyman pointed out something that I was kind of reading into, but wasn't sure about either, where, on the end of what I was reading, says, advanced data protection for iCloud is an optional setting that offers our highest level of cloud data security.
[547.38 --> 555.94]  And Handyman is saying that the key is only stored on just the user side if you have that advanced data protection enabled.
[556.32 --> 558.86]  So they have the keys for everything on their end.
[560.30 --> 561.04]  I see.
[561.22 --> 566.38]  If you're not running advanced data security, which I would assume, like, less than 1% of people are running.
[566.40 --> 570.54]  Yeah, if it's not a default, I don't think most users are going to be touching it.
[570.62 --> 570.82]  Totally.
[570.82 --> 572.54]  And, like, Google has the same thing.
[572.60 --> 573.64]  Almost no one runs it.
[575.86 --> 579.96]  So they absolutely have a way to decrypt it on there.
[580.88 --> 584.62]  There's people in the chat that are saying this has nothing to do with iCloud.
[584.94 --> 587.40]  It sounds more like data wasn't deleted off the device storage.
[587.40 --> 601.98]  But the thing is that the way that NAND Flash works, like, it's, um, once you do a secure erase, which, from my understanding, is part of the device wiping process for both Android and iOS at this point.
[602.34 --> 617.18]  Once you do a secure erase, NAND Flash doesn't work the same way as old mechanical storage did, where you could kind of reconstruct at least parts of files by just looking at contiguous ones and zeros along the tracks in the platter.
[617.18 --> 618.72]  It's not like that.
[618.90 --> 632.66]  Once you delete the index of what all of those zeros and ones in all of these NAND cells correspond to, there's not really a meaningful way to reconstruct that.
[632.74 --> 640.78]  The only way that you can recover data from a NAND Flash device is by recovering the controller.
[641.00 --> 645.76]  Like, you essentially have to restore that index that's stored on the controller.
[645.76 --> 647.92]  You can't just get it from NAND chips.
[648.64 --> 655.42]  So, from Apple, on the iPhone, go to Settings, General, Reset, and Select Erase All Content and Settings.
[655.78 --> 658.56]  This is a secure erase of everything but iOS.
[658.90 --> 660.24]  So, it sounds like you're right.
[660.54 --> 661.12]  That's what they're doing.
[662.60 --> 666.70]  People are talking about, like, you should talk about how OS's mark things as deleted.
[666.94 --> 669.48]  That's not generally what he's talking about.
[669.58 --> 672.24]  What you're talking about is removing a pointer to a file, effectively.
[672.24 --> 681.74]  So, you tell your operating system to delete something, and instead of actually deleting it, because it's like, whatever, this is Flash, it just forgets where it is, and then will eventually write something over top of it.
[681.82 --> 683.14]  That's not secure erase, though.
[683.30 --> 689.76]  And it won't even write something over top of it until you've removed it from your recycle bin, potentially, depending on the operating system you're on.
[689.76 --> 693.42]  Like, for example, I haven't been using an iPhone lately.
[693.54 --> 697.16]  So, the last Apple device that I used daily was the Vision Pro.
[697.50 --> 705.48]  And I wanted to delete a screen recording, and I deleted it, and it warned me immediately.
[705.60 --> 712.52]  It was like, hey, this is going into your to-be-deleted folder, and you'll have to go in there, and you'll have to delete it.
[712.52 --> 721.56]  I wanted to play around with the file management on the Vision Pro, because I was trying to transfer screen recordings off of it.
[722.62 --> 727.52]  And so, I was just like, I was doing all these screen recordings, and I was like, oh my god, there's no way to-
[727.52 --> 730.44]  You can't just plug a cable in and transfer data.
[730.60 --> 731.32]  Are you cutting me?
[731.36 --> 733.10]  Okay, so how do I get rid of stuff on this thing?
[733.10 --> 735.64]  And so, I was trying to figure out how to delete a screen recording.
[736.38 --> 740.52]  And so, I ended up having to kind of navigate through that.
[740.70 --> 745.46]  All the little icky-picky details that were in my notes for the Vision Pro didn't really end up in the review,
[745.54 --> 752.12]  because we were so late, because we got the device so late, that it ended up being more like, okay, what new perspective can we give on it?
[752.32 --> 755.92]  Everyone kind of, you know, I didn't need to talk about their file explorer or whatever, right?
[755.92 --> 764.20]  But as far as I could tell, the way it works is it goes into a recycle bin for 30 days, and then it's automatically purged from there.
[764.28 --> 769.54]  So, you wouldn't be at risk of overwriting anything until it's purged from there.
[769.98 --> 778.34]  But it should be noted that the iCloud account that I was using, or the, yeah, the iCloud account that I was using did have extra data storage purchased,
[778.34 --> 783.86]  so it was also synced online, so then there was an additional step in order to delete it off of there as well as a whole thing.
[783.86 --> 790.58]  Yeah, is this, like, person who sold their device thing, is that a one-off?
[791.02 --> 792.34]  I don't even see that in the notes.
[792.34 --> 797.06]  Well, it looks like lots of users are reporting their...
[797.06 --> 800.30]  The photo's coming back, but is the sold device thing a one-off?
[800.50 --> 801.86]  Because I...
[801.86 --> 807.02]  I think these could potentially be different scenarios.
[807.24 --> 807.94]  They could be.
[809.26 --> 813.02]  Like someone secure erasing their device and selling it to someone else on this happening
[813.02 --> 816.28]  is different than someone just randomly having photos come back.
[817.16 --> 819.96]  This includes previously wiped devices.
[820.52 --> 828.22]  So, as far as we can tell, at least one user had revealing photos reappear,
[828.34 --> 834.14]  but it might not be just one user who ended up with photos that didn't belong to them showing up on their device.
[834.14 --> 841.32]  Guys, if you've read a bunch, I have spent the entire day today building a computer for our CEO,
[841.60 --> 843.10]  which, by the way, is going to be awesome.
[843.36 --> 847.28]  We took suggestions from Reddit for what the theme of the build should be.
[847.40 --> 849.90]  We ended up with all kinds of great suggestions.
[849.90 --> 853.26]  The one that we ultimately settled on was all Chrome.
[854.20 --> 855.34]  And Luke's seen it.
[855.46 --> 856.74]  It's pretty amazing, actually.
[858.14 --> 859.04]  It's pretty cool.
[859.04 --> 861.10]  You haven't seen the chair yet, though.
[863.84 --> 864.28]  Oh.
[865.02 --> 867.68]  Is it, like, actually going to be uncomfortable for him to work?
[867.86 --> 869.44]  I mean, it doesn't sound like my problem.
[869.62 --> 870.46]  Oh, my God.
[872.48 --> 874.54]  Why is a chief executive sitting down?
[877.80 --> 880.12]  Should be decisive and a man of action.
[881.32 --> 883.00]  Moving around, talking to the people.
[884.54 --> 885.78]  Anyway, it's going to be great.
[885.78 --> 892.08]  All I'm getting out of this is that none of the C-levels are going to have chairs anymore.
[892.22 --> 896.52]  So let's not rule out user error, I guess, is what we're trying to say.
[896.72 --> 897.18]  On some of it.
[897.22 --> 903.42]  I'm not saying the thing as a whole, but you run into scenarios like this where, like,
[903.94 --> 907.02]  some people that had this genuinely happen speak up,
[907.68 --> 911.00]  and then a bunch of other people that just, like, screwed up but don't know also speak up.
[911.00 --> 914.84]  And it ends up getting kind of lost in the sauce a little bit.
[917.84 --> 922.04]  There's enough reports here that it sounds like this is actually probably happening to a certain degree,
[922.16 --> 925.00]  but I don't think, based on the information that we have,
[925.06 --> 927.42]  that we're going to be able to figure out, like, the mechanism that's failing.
[927.74 --> 927.94]  Yep.
[927.94 --> 932.92]  A lot of people just seem to generally be kind of struggling with iCloud.
[933.10 --> 936.12]  Like, Skosh in Floatplane Chat says,
[936.22 --> 940.98]  I've had photos that I delete locally stay on iCloud and not show specifically that they still exist.
[941.04 --> 941.88]  It could have redownloaded.
[942.00 --> 945.74]  That was one of the things that bothered me when I was trying to delete that thing from the Vision Pro as well,
[945.78 --> 946.68]  is I couldn't tell.
[946.78 --> 946.90]  Interesting.
[946.90 --> 950.30]  I couldn't tell how...
[950.30 --> 951.74]  If this was device level or cloud level?
[951.76 --> 952.76]  How I was deleting it.
[952.78 --> 957.80]  And I could see Apple taking that approach for the sake of what we were talking about earlier,
[957.92 --> 959.26]  the ability to restore data.
[959.38 --> 960.92]  I bet you that's a lot of this issue.
[960.92 --> 961.58]  But, man...
[961.58 --> 962.08]  Resyncing.
[962.26 --> 962.96]  With a photo.
[963.32 --> 965.86]  You know, sometimes when you delete a photo, you're like...
[965.86 --> 966.76]  I want this gone.
[966.78 --> 967.84]  This needs to be Yote.
[967.96 --> 968.22]  Yeah.
[968.82 --> 969.22]  Yeah.
[971.22 --> 974.44]  And I understand Apple's design philosophy.
[974.44 --> 977.38]  You know, big, simple buttons, you know?
[977.84 --> 980.96]  But sometimes, right-click is the answer.
[981.48 --> 984.72]  A context menu is just superior.
[985.78 --> 987.18]  Your philosophy be damned.
[987.98 --> 988.68]  So, we'll see.
[988.76 --> 989.24]  Yeah, I don't know.
[989.42 --> 991.08]  Well, we'll see how this goes.
[991.32 --> 992.26]  Going to be interesting.
[992.42 --> 993.98]  Why don't we jump into our next topic here?
[994.04 --> 995.10]  You want to pick another headline one?
[996.20 --> 997.24]  Uh, sure.
[997.36 --> 998.04]  How about the controller?
[998.38 --> 999.24]  Want to talk about the controller?
[999.60 --> 999.96]  Yeah.
[1000.16 --> 1000.92]  This thing looks sick.
[1001.06 --> 1001.72]  It's very cool.
[1001.74 --> 1002.26]  Look at this thing.
[1002.26 --> 1004.68]  Microsoft announces the Proteus controller.
[1005.04 --> 1009.64]  Microsoft has announced the Proteus controller, a modular controller with swappable faceplates
[1009.64 --> 1014.00]  and customizable components for gamers with various mobility issues.
[1014.34 --> 1018.12]  The cube-like modules can be snapped together in countless different configurations.
[1018.60 --> 1020.12]  Its buttons are remappable.
[1020.48 --> 1025.12]  And its analog sticks can be swapped out for 3D-printed sticks with custom grips.
[1025.12 --> 1034.88]  And those, several files for these sticks are available on BioWave's website, Bio with a B-Y-O.
[1035.02 --> 1035.92]  So, I'm going to share this now.
[1036.24 --> 1042.22]  So, they're showing right here, we are open sourcing the mechanical connection mechanism for the Proteus controller.
[1042.34 --> 1047.46]  This will allow you to 3D-print different components such as handles, analog sticks, mounts, whatever you can think of.
[1047.68 --> 1049.40]  Here are some examples of downloadable files.
[1049.40 --> 1050.20]  Man, show some of these.
[1050.20 --> 1050.90]  These are cool.
[1051.52 --> 1052.76]  And these are sick.
[1053.26 --> 1059.08]  So, it goes from like just fairly standard concave top analog stick to ball grips.
[1059.24 --> 1060.06]  XL rest.
[1060.20 --> 1061.16]  That's super cool.
[1061.16 --> 1062.94]  So, for chins or elbows.
[1063.40 --> 1067.30]  So, you can control a joystick more easily and hopefully more comfortably.
[1068.04 --> 1069.54]  Ridge cap analog sticks.
[1069.80 --> 1078.24]  A thin grip analog stick, which could be very interesting because if you notice how it tends to flare, you might be able to attach something to this.
[1078.72 --> 1083.46]  So, you could move in like a different plane but have it adjust a joystick, which is very cool.
[1084.54 --> 1087.82]  Control grip analog caps and square head analog sticks.
[1087.82 --> 1098.38]  And by open sourcing the mechanism, they're making it so that not only are they making these files able to be downloaded and others able to be downloaded later, but you should be able to design your own as well.
[1098.66 --> 1100.70]  Which is very cool.
[1100.82 --> 1105.18]  Because as far as my understanding goes, that community is kind of all about customizing.
[1105.44 --> 1108.32]  So, being able to 3D-print and design your own is probably going to be a pretty big deal.
[1108.56 --> 1109.14]  Super cool.
[1109.14 --> 1111.82]  I think that's a problem with the way that 3D-printing materials are changing.
[1112.38 --> 1117.18]  Like, it's not like this has to be made out of just standard PLA.
[1118.04 --> 1120.24]  Like, you could make them actually comfortable.
[1120.48 --> 1120.58]  Yeah.
[1120.68 --> 1122.36]  You know, with like multi-material printing.
[1122.44 --> 1122.76]  Soft touch.
[1122.76 --> 1123.06]  Yeah.
[1123.56 --> 1128.66]  So, you can have, you know, a nice stiff shaft and then you can have like a softer end cap.
[1128.92 --> 1136.82]  And, man, this is, it's one of those things that Microsoft just, I feel like, doesn't get enough attention for.
[1137.18 --> 1140.12]  The fact that they do this kind of thing.
[1140.24 --> 1143.80]  I mean, look, they're a soulless corporation.
[1144.68 --> 1147.44]  Let's treat them as what they are.
[1147.44 --> 1151.66]  Any company with shareholders at the end of the day is going to look out for its bottom line first.
[1151.76 --> 1152.42]  We know that.
[1152.96 --> 1154.84]  But, can you grow up?
[1155.60 --> 1157.56]  I'm trying to hold it in here, too.
[1158.74 --> 1161.14]  You and Dan laughing in the background is not helpful.
[1163.94 --> 1165.74]  Both of you, get your s*** together.
[1167.82 --> 1168.62]  Oh, man.
[1168.72 --> 1168.94]  Oops.
[1169.78 --> 1170.18]  Anyways.
[1170.52 --> 1170.92]  Anyway.
[1171.26 --> 1174.12]  So, the point is, yeah, okay, they're a corporation.
[1174.12 --> 1180.70]  But, I feel like this is the kind of thing that when they do, we should be paying a lot of attention to.
[1180.92 --> 1183.18]  We should be giving them a lot of praise for.
[1183.42 --> 1183.80]  Absolutely.
[1183.92 --> 1186.76]  Because, realistically, this makes no commercial sense.
[1187.34 --> 1193.52]  The development of this, it's not going to pay for itself.
[1193.66 --> 1193.74]  No.
[1194.22 --> 1198.22]  This is legitimately about enabling gamers.
[1198.88 --> 1199.98]  And, that's super cool.
[1200.12 --> 1200.96]  I love it.
[1200.96 --> 1201.32]  Yeah.
[1201.48 --> 1201.88]  Yeah.
[1201.94 --> 1205.62]  And, to note as well, this doesn't replace the adaptive controller.
[1205.74 --> 1208.36]  The adaptive controller is wicked cool.
[1208.82 --> 1212.60]  And, honestly, I could end up seeing a lot of setups that end up using both.
[1213.18 --> 1213.62]  Absolutely.
[1214.20 --> 1219.42]  The one problem that they're running to there running both is just that it's going to be fairly costly.
[1220.06 --> 1223.04]  This Proteus controller costs about $300.
[1223.04 --> 1226.66]  It's on sale right now, actually.
[1227.10 --> 1229.82]  If you go to buy it, I think it's 15% off right now.
[1230.62 --> 1232.76]  Let me see really quick.
[1234.46 --> 1235.02]  Yeah.
[1235.24 --> 1237.46]  So, it's 15% off right now.
[1237.64 --> 1240.42]  But, it'll theoretically be $300 longer on USD.
[1241.96 --> 1246.30]  But, that kind of makes sense because it's very complicated.
[1246.30 --> 1251.16]  I think the Xbox adaptive controller, while being super cool, is a little bit more basic.
[1252.08 --> 1254.02]  This is a fairly complicated controller.
[1254.16 --> 1255.30]  But, I like seeing stuff like this.
[1255.40 --> 1258.02]  Like you said, it's unlikely to make a ton of money.
[1258.42 --> 1262.56]  It doesn't excuse buying up game developers and closing them.
[1263.02 --> 1263.22]  Yeah.
[1264.14 --> 1265.04]  That's lame.
[1265.54 --> 1266.08]  Not cool.
[1266.10 --> 1268.46]  But, we can hit them for that and also praise them for this.
[1268.52 --> 1268.70]  Yeah.
[1268.88 --> 1270.08]  Because, this is great.
[1270.18 --> 1271.18]  This is like the opposite.
[1271.64 --> 1272.80]  This is like the opposite of that.
[1272.80 --> 1276.68]  This is making gaming more accessible and friendlier.
[1277.30 --> 1277.46]  Yeah.
[1277.50 --> 1279.52]  Which is something gaming needs sometimes.
[1279.86 --> 1281.76]  Something on the other end of this.
[1281.80 --> 1284.28]  If you're like, this sounds cool, but it's not applicable to me.
[1284.44 --> 1289.34]  On the other end of this, in my opinion, I'm surprised that especially people on the pro scene
[1289.34 --> 1293.94]  don't find more use out of things like the Proteus controller and the adaptive controller.
[1295.18 --> 1301.98]  Because, if you are able to enhance the inputs that you have by making it so that you can introduce
[1301.98 --> 1304.00]  your feet or something else.
[1304.24 --> 1304.42]  Yeah.
[1304.48 --> 1307.70]  Or, you know, bringing back our old concept of clinch to prone.
[1307.88 --> 1308.12]  Yeah.
[1308.32 --> 1308.64]  Yeah.
[1308.88 --> 1310.38]  I was wondering.
[1310.76 --> 1312.94]  You could make that work with the adaptive controller.
[1313.18 --> 1314.00]  Very likely could.
[1314.08 --> 1314.28]  Yeah.
[1315.04 --> 1316.14]  But, yeah.
[1316.70 --> 1318.94]  Especially for games that have a huge amount of inputs.
[1319.10 --> 1324.02]  I'm a little bit surprised you don't see more utilization of these just for, like,
[1324.42 --> 1325.66]  making you more competitive.
[1325.90 --> 1326.12]  Yeah.
[1326.52 --> 1326.68]  Yeah.
[1326.68 --> 1326.76]  Yeah.
[1326.88 --> 1328.86]  So, consider that as well.
[1328.86 --> 1331.62]  What do we jump into?
[1331.78 --> 1332.78]  Dan, what are we doing next?
[1333.06 --> 1334.18]  Next up is merch messages.
[1334.62 --> 1334.94]  Okay.
[1335.02 --> 1336.36]  Let's do some merch messages.
[1337.14 --> 1340.42]  If you guys are new to the WAN show, welcome.
[1340.98 --> 1341.34]  Hi.
[1341.52 --> 1342.58]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[1342.78 --> 1346.18]  I already said it once, but really, though, welcome to the WAN show.
[1346.24 --> 1347.26]  Welcome to you specifically.
[1347.44 --> 1348.60]  We don't do super chats.
[1348.68 --> 1349.62]  We don't do Twitch bits.
[1349.70 --> 1350.72]  You can send one if you want.
[1350.78 --> 1351.54]  We'll take your money.
[1351.82 --> 1352.16]  Sure.
[1352.48 --> 1352.82]  Fine.
[1352.82 --> 1353.68]  I'll put it in the pile.
[1353.68 --> 1354.52]  JK.
[1354.96 --> 1359.36]  Use it to pay nice people like Luke and Dan and all the other, you know, dozens and
[1359.36 --> 1360.38]  dozens of people who work here.
[1360.82 --> 1364.94]  But what we really want you guys to do is we want you to get something back for the money
[1364.94 --> 1366.44]  that you are throwing at your screen.
[1366.54 --> 1369.10]  And that's why we created merch messages.
[1369.46 --> 1371.74]  All you got to do is go to LTTstore.com.
[1372.06 --> 1375.04]  Check out some of our amazing products over there.
[1375.04 --> 1383.56]  And in the cart, whenever we're live, you will see a box where you can leave a merch message.
[1383.76 --> 1385.98]  It will be responded to by producer Dan.
[1386.36 --> 1391.34]  And he can either, yep, just like chuck it up here like this, or he'll respond to it himself,
[1391.34 --> 1395.60]  or he'll send it to someone else internally who can best answer your question, or he'll
[1395.60 --> 1399.14]  curate it for me and Luke to talk about here on the show.
[1399.14 --> 1401.12]  So we're going to do a couple curated ones.
[1401.12 --> 1405.44]  But first, I want to highlight a couple of things that are going on on the store right
[1405.44 --> 1405.70]  now.
[1405.82 --> 1406.98]  It's finally here.
[1407.26 --> 1410.42]  Luke, this product has been in development for like two years.
[1410.96 --> 1411.26]  Whoa.
[1412.24 --> 1414.76]  It's the Dip Dye hoodie.
[1415.78 --> 1419.16]  Maria asked me specifically before the show.
[1419.24 --> 1425.34]  I ran into her because we're having a LAN at my place this weekend and her husband's coming.
[1425.76 --> 1427.02]  And so I was like, yo, are you coming?
[1427.18 --> 1429.20]  And she's like, well, he's coming.
[1429.34 --> 1430.40]  And I'm like, yeah, but are you?
[1430.40 --> 1431.68]  She's like, I don't know.
[1431.76 --> 1432.90]  I'm thinking, I'm like, yeah, it's fine.
[1432.98 --> 1433.74]  You can just send him.
[1434.98 --> 1437.48]  He comes to a lot of our events.
[1437.50 --> 1438.98]  I was going to say, he's a part of the events at this point.
[1438.98 --> 1441.20]  Yeah, he comes to softball night and stuff.
[1441.34 --> 1443.76]  He doesn't really need to be plus one anymore at this point.
[1443.80 --> 1449.06]  But anyway, the point was, I ran into her and she was like, okay, okay, you often show
[1449.06 --> 1453.98]  the product page and, you know, talk about the new product, but like pay attention to
[1453.98 --> 1454.46]  the photos.
[1454.62 --> 1456.22]  She's really proud of the photos for this one.
[1456.22 --> 1457.68]  Dan and I were talking about these before the show.
[1457.74 --> 1458.26]  They're really nice.
[1459.10 --> 1459.76]  Oh, killing it.
[1459.76 --> 1459.94]  Yeah.
[1460.32 --> 1460.68]  Phenomenal.
[1461.10 --> 1464.08]  Man, they went and they got like color matching glasses and everything.
[1464.24 --> 1465.00]  That one is amazing.
[1465.02 --> 1465.54]  Oh, that's awesome.
[1465.54 --> 1467.02]  The ones where they have the games.
[1467.14 --> 1467.24]  Yeah.
[1467.44 --> 1470.48]  I remember she called out in general chat.
[1470.58 --> 1472.02]  Hey, does anybody have these props?
[1472.08 --> 1475.08]  Like it was premeditated and like, okay, we're going to do this.
[1475.20 --> 1475.82]  It's awesome.
[1476.38 --> 1477.34]  Freaking awesome.
[1478.18 --> 1479.08]  Pokemon game.
[1480.12 --> 1481.26]  Japanese version too.
[1481.26 --> 1488.04]  I love seeing people like use their creative energy to do something different.
[1488.26 --> 1489.14]  Hey, my first phone.
[1490.76 --> 1490.92]  What?
[1491.04 --> 1492.52]  The Motorola V-Box right there.
[1492.96 --> 1493.82]  That's a phone?
[1494.10 --> 1494.36]  Yeah.
[1494.44 --> 1495.22]  Well, sort of.
[1495.22 --> 1496.98]  I mean, it's phone.
[1497.06 --> 1498.94]  It's phone like in functionality.
[1499.16 --> 1499.78]  Phone adjacent.
[1500.24 --> 1500.48]  Yeah.
[1501.66 --> 1502.98]  So there it is, my friends.
[1503.32 --> 1504.44]  The dip dye hoodie.
[1504.76 --> 1505.50]  It's here.
[1505.86 --> 1508.90]  You too could look this cool while you game.
[1509.14 --> 1509.36]  Yeah.
[1509.48 --> 1509.64]  Okay.
[1509.64 --> 1510.16]  Maybe not that one.
[1510.22 --> 1510.66]  This cool.
[1510.74 --> 1512.74]  You could look this cool while you game.
[1512.84 --> 1513.06]  No, no.
[1513.06 --> 1515.14]  I'm just making fun of David.
[1515.14 --> 1520.28]  Anyway, we've got the dip dye hoodie.
[1520.48 --> 1524.42]  What else do we have going on this week that might be worth sending a merch message over?
[1525.12 --> 1526.84]  Well, no, that's the new big update.
[1526.94 --> 1528.00]  Well, I'm going to put mine on.
[1528.06 --> 1528.78]  It's not that warm.
[1529.34 --> 1531.62]  And Dan, do you want to hit us with a merch message?
[1532.42 --> 1532.78]  Yeah, sure.
[1532.82 --> 1533.68]  I've got a few here for you.
[1533.74 --> 1534.20]  Let's see.
[1534.20 --> 1539.72]  Hey, all with dating apps like Bumble getting on the AI hype train, how do you think that
[1539.72 --> 1544.76]  application of machine learning might influence the next generation's dating habits, if at
[1544.76 --> 1544.98]  all?
[1545.14 --> 1548.44]  We've seen that Black Mirror episode, right?
[1549.00 --> 1549.44]  Yeah.
[1549.70 --> 1550.52]  Hang the DJ.
[1550.90 --> 1557.64]  All I've heard from the dating scene for a long time now is just screams and terror.
[1559.08 --> 1559.42]  Yeah.
[1559.62 --> 1561.36]  I mean, that's one of our topics for later.
[1561.36 --> 1563.34]  Just seem to be looting people.
[1563.92 --> 1565.58]  I didn't know that was a topic, actually.
[1565.68 --> 1565.80]  Yeah.
[1565.80 --> 1568.96]  We're going to be talking about have your AI date my AI.
[1570.32 --> 1572.98]  But why don't we just do that topic right now?
[1573.10 --> 1574.46]  And then we'll talk about it.
[1574.46 --> 1574.96]  Yeah.
[1574.96 --> 1575.12]  Yeah.
[1575.12 --> 1580.60]  So Bumble founder Whitney Wolf Heard stated in a recent interview that she thinks the future
[1580.60 --> 1590.52]  of online dating is for apps to develop a personalizable AI concierge that you can confide in, talk about
[1590.52 --> 1593.16]  your insecurities, and get pointers from.
[1593.90 --> 1600.66]  She then likewise suggested that in the future we'll be able to send AI bots based on our personalities
[1600.66 --> 1607.76]  on simulated dates with other people's AI bots as a way of confirming compatibility and narrowing
[1607.76 --> 1608.88]  down potential matches.
[1612.88 --> 1613.28]  Huh.
[1613.28 --> 1621.78]  So, I mean, is Big Tech basically just treating Black Mirror as a playbook at this point?
[1622.90 --> 1625.30]  You know, the show doesn't have to be prophetic.
[1625.84 --> 1627.76]  Like, we can still stop this.
[1628.00 --> 1631.72]  What happens if, like, someone's AI traumatizes someone else's AI?
[1632.84 --> 1633.64]  Are they liable?
[1633.64 --> 1637.30]  Like, what is this?
[1637.38 --> 1638.26]  What does this even mean?
[1638.30 --> 1640.44]  So our merch message question, that's the important one.
[1640.52 --> 1643.76]  Thank you very much for checking out, lttstore.com.
[1643.82 --> 1650.22]  Our merch message question is, how will this impact the relationships of future generations?
[1650.80 --> 1651.30]  And...
[1651.30 --> 1652.10]  I think it's going to be rough.
[1652.10 --> 1655.94]  I feel a little unqualified to talk about this, to be perfectly honest with you, because
[1655.94 --> 1658.08]  I have never even dated online.
[1658.66 --> 1662.44]  Like, that was still taboo when I started...
[1662.44 --> 1663.80]  When I settled.
[1664.34 --> 1664.52]  Yeah.
[1664.96 --> 1665.66]  Settled down.
[1666.84 --> 1667.24]  Wow.
[1667.38 --> 1669.52]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1669.60 --> 1670.36]  Sit down, Freud.
[1671.38 --> 1672.12]  Sit down.
[1672.20 --> 1673.30]  That made it worse.
[1673.78 --> 1674.56]  You shouldn't have brought him up.
[1677.40 --> 1678.16]  Settled down.
[1678.50 --> 1678.78]  Yep.
[1678.92 --> 1679.18]  Yep.
[1679.48 --> 1680.22]  Good luck, by the way.
[1682.10 --> 1683.70]  Guys, just chill.
[1683.86 --> 1684.42]  Just chill.
[1684.80 --> 1685.14]  Good luck.
[1685.38 --> 1685.92]  A person123...
[1685.92 --> 1687.24]  May the odds ever be in your favor.
[1687.54 --> 1691.16]  A person123 says, dating apps already broke dating for my generation.
[1691.36 --> 1692.52]  This is just the obituary.
[1692.64 --> 1693.60]  I've heard that a lot.
[1693.70 --> 1698.78]  I've been reading a lot of articles that Gen Z and millennials are just saying, see you
[1698.78 --> 1699.88]  later to data apps right now.
[1699.88 --> 1700.24]  Done with it.
[1700.24 --> 1703.98]  Match group seems to be kind of desperately trying to keep...
[1703.98 --> 1705.36]  What was the old big one?
[1705.40 --> 1705.58]  Tinder.
[1706.02 --> 1711.28]  They seem to be just desperately trying to keep Tinder revenues up, putting in these new
[1711.28 --> 1717.64]  ways of sending people paid things or whatever, these super premium accounts and stuff like
[1717.64 --> 1717.92]  that.
[1718.00 --> 1721.90]  As far as my understanding goes, even more than it originally was, and it was originally
[1721.90 --> 1729.86]  very much this, it has just turned into extremely short-term engagement seekers.
[1729.86 --> 1730.94]  Yeah.
[1730.94 --> 1730.98]  Yeah.
[1730.98 --> 1736.00]  Uh, Scoach says, as someone in Gen Z, almost everyone on dating apps just wants short-term
[1736.00 --> 1737.04]  relationships right now.
[1737.22 --> 1737.36]  Yeah.
[1737.36 --> 1739.20]  There's another word for short-term relationships.
[1739.36 --> 1740.10]  It's called f***ing.
[1740.92 --> 1742.88]  Um, and yeah.
[1743.08 --> 1744.86]  So it was heavily like that.
[1745.38 --> 1745.70]  Uh...
[1745.70 --> 1746.92]  Like early on, wasn't it?
[1746.92 --> 1747.00]  Yes.
[1747.00 --> 1748.40]  I thought that was the whole point of Tinder.
[1748.68 --> 1749.28]  But it...
[1749.28 --> 1751.50]  You could still, like, find relationships on there.
[1751.58 --> 1753.96]  Right, because that wasn't what, like, Plenty of Fish was for.
[1753.96 --> 1754.32]  Yeah.
[1754.72 --> 1754.96]  Right.
[1754.96 --> 1759.64]  And there was other sites that were specifically not really for that, even though it still happened,
[1759.72 --> 1760.06]  obviously.
[1760.50 --> 1765.06]  And then Tinder was more for that, but some people were not looking for that on those types
[1765.06 --> 1765.52]  of services.
[1765.52 --> 1766.62]  Like the swipe services.
[1766.90 --> 1770.42]  Some people were actually just looking for long-term relationships and had to deal with
[1770.42 --> 1771.88]  all the people that were not.
[1772.52 --> 1778.12]  Um, and as far as my understanding goes, as someone who hasn't used it in a decade, um,
[1779.48 --> 1782.82]  hearing complaints from people that do, it is only that now.
[1782.82 --> 1784.90]  And, like, there's people asking.
[1785.14 --> 1790.14]  I have genuinely had someone ask me, like, how would I go about finding someone to date?
[1790.38 --> 1792.12]  I'm like, how the heck am I supposed to know?
[1792.12 --> 1792.90]  Wait, who asked you that?
[1793.06 --> 1793.20]  Oh.
[1793.38 --> 1793.84]  I don't want to.
[1793.92 --> 1794.48]  Yeah, okay.
[1795.04 --> 1795.56]  I just mean...
[1795.56 --> 1798.80]  I'm like, brother, I've been in a relationship for, like, actually almost 10 years.
[1798.80 --> 1799.62]  Like, what do you want?
[1799.82 --> 1800.34]  I don't...
[1800.34 --> 1801.40]  I can't help you.
[1801.44 --> 1802.18]  Make them chicken?
[1804.98 --> 1811.72]  But it's like, it's weird because ever since dating apps became a thing, approaching people
[1811.72 --> 1818.36]  about potentially dating when you don't know them yet in real life became kind of, like,
[1818.48 --> 1819.40]  notably taboo.
[1820.28 --> 1820.76]  Really?
[1820.84 --> 1822.32]  But now the dating apps suck.
[1823.88 --> 1826.40]  So it's like, actually, what do I do?
[1826.74 --> 1827.60]  I don't know.
[1827.60 --> 1829.60]  See, like, I...
[1829.60 --> 1832.32]  Yeah, I...
[1832.32 --> 1832.56]  Man.
[1834.06 --> 1835.60]  Meeting people in school...
[1836.28 --> 1837.24]  That was like...
[1837.24 --> 1838.48]  Was so easy.
[1838.62 --> 1838.90]  Yeah.
[1839.06 --> 1839.72]  Like, we...
[1839.72 --> 1840.56]  I feel like...
[1840.56 --> 1841.30]  It was rough after that.
[1841.30 --> 1848.84]  If you're in school still, do not take for granted how easy it is to network and, like,
[1848.90 --> 1851.28]  expand your social circle and make connections.
[1851.60 --> 1858.28]  If there was something that someone could have, you know, that if I had been able to internalize
[1858.28 --> 1865.58]  properly, that I wish I had processed when I was in school, it would have been make way
[1865.58 --> 1868.74]  more connections because once you're an adult...
[1868.74 --> 1869.58]  I was talking to...
[1870.40 --> 1871.98]  Shoot, who was it?
[1872.08 --> 1872.94]  Someone on the team.
[1873.02 --> 1877.40]  I think it might have been David who's thinking of joining an adult sports league.
[1877.86 --> 1878.08]  Nice.
[1878.12 --> 1880.72]  And I was like, man, that sounds awesome.
[1881.12 --> 1886.86]  And I would love to be a part of what sounds like a super cool thing for you, but that is
[1886.86 --> 1891.38]  just not going to be an option for me because I didn't play that particular sports ball as
[1891.38 --> 1891.76]  a kid.
[1891.76 --> 1896.48]  And picking up a sport as an adult is freaking hard.
[1896.72 --> 1903.14]  And the reason I'm bringing this up is that one of the few bloody ways that adults can
[1903.14 --> 1909.74]  network outside of work and can make new connections is through activities, right?
[1910.08 --> 1917.54]  And, like, I don't know about you guys, but, like, for me, sports is one of the go-tos.
[1917.72 --> 1918.16]  100%.
[1918.16 --> 1920.20]  And it's...
[1920.20 --> 1921.92]  Man, it's so hard.
[1922.00 --> 1923.14]  People can be so clicky.
[1923.58 --> 1928.14]  A lot of people forge their lifelong connections, like, when they're in their teens.
[1928.36 --> 1928.44]  Yes.
[1928.44 --> 1930.94]  And it's hard to break into those groups.
[1931.06 --> 1934.26]  Like, I even noticed this in, like, other...
[1934.26 --> 1936.42]  In, like, parent groups, right?
[1936.42 --> 1940.70]  Where all their kids are already friends, and all the parents are already friends, and
[1940.70 --> 1941.88]  don't wander away, hold on.
[1943.38 --> 1945.24]  And all the parents are already friends.
[1945.86 --> 1948.68]  And penetrating that click, you're always kind of the...
[1950.28 --> 1954.68]  Well, we only got three campsites, so...
[1954.68 --> 1958.34]  You're the fourth one.
[1958.50 --> 1960.78]  Like, you're always that, right?
[1960.82 --> 1961.52]  In the edge case, yeah.
[1962.72 --> 1964.08]  Maybe it will work.
[1964.16 --> 1966.84]  Maybe it works for this one event, but, like...
[1966.84 --> 1968.90]  And I feel like...
[1968.90 --> 1970.24]  Like, man, if I...
[1970.24 --> 1972.06]  Here, can you come here for a second?
[1974.64 --> 1977.94]  Because if I didn't have you...
[1977.94 --> 1979.12]  See, look, Yvonne's here.
[1979.34 --> 1979.76]  Hi, lady.
[1981.84 --> 1983.28]  I would just have...
[1983.28 --> 1984.54]  Okay, here, let's have some fun.
[1984.96 --> 1986.58]  I would have no idea how to meet people.
[1986.68 --> 1987.54]  Okay, Yvonne, here.
[1987.96 --> 1988.10]  Come.
[1989.16 --> 1989.38]  Okay.
[1989.72 --> 1991.30]  Okay, I die tomorrow.
[1991.68 --> 1992.80]  How do you meet people?
[1993.38 --> 1994.14]  You're gonna make me cry.
[1994.16 --> 1995.36]  You're really far away from the mic.
[1995.54 --> 1996.12]  Oh, okay.
[1996.20 --> 1997.12]  You have to be way closer.
[1997.36 --> 1998.40]  Oh, okay, this is weird.
[1999.32 --> 2000.38]  How would I meet people?
[2002.50 --> 2002.90]  Um...
[2002.90 --> 2006.44]  Man, I don't know, because I think online dating is being phased out, too, isn't it?
[2006.46 --> 2008.02]  Yeah, that's kind of what we're talking about right now.
[2008.32 --> 2009.82]  It's essentially the topic.
[2010.10 --> 2013.26]  And I've heard how terrible online dating in general is, too.
[2013.66 --> 2013.82]  Yeah.
[2014.60 --> 2015.44]  Oh, man.
[2016.22 --> 2017.06]  So, like, if you...
[2017.06 --> 2019.36]  Essentially, let's just assume you're cutting out...
[2019.38 --> 2019.96]  Online dating.
[2020.14 --> 2024.02]  Yeah, I would probably try to take some classes and see if I meet people with similar interests.
[2024.24 --> 2025.38]  Okay, so, like, hobby classes?
[2025.54 --> 2026.10]  Yeah, yeah.
[2026.16 --> 2031.48]  Or I do activities, like, I'd go on hikes or, um, things like that.
[2031.64 --> 2032.38]  Okay, so this is good.
[2032.38 --> 2033.46]  I hear getting a dog is a good thing.
[2034.12 --> 2035.86]  Okay, so if you...
[2035.86 --> 2038.72]  So if you take up hiking, then I better watch out.
[2042.46 --> 2044.02]  This is information gathering.
[2045.12 --> 2046.24]  Okay, what would you do?
[2047.20 --> 2047.88]  Oh, man.
[2048.54 --> 2050.46]  Because, like, I'm not the kind of person to go party...
[2050.46 --> 2050.94]  Hold on, you're really far away.
[2051.26 --> 2051.56]  Oh, sorry.
[2051.62 --> 2054.74]  I'm not the kind of person to go party or go to a bar or do any of those things.
[2054.94 --> 2056.30]  Like, and especially with kids.
[2056.32 --> 2057.44]  It's so hard with kids.
[2058.80 --> 2059.12]  Yeah.
[2059.30 --> 2060.02]  What would you do?
[2060.46 --> 2063.06]  I mean, I heard VR porn is, like, really good now.
[2063.06 --> 2066.30]  So you just wouldn't, basically?
[2066.70 --> 2072.92]  No, I am, like, I'm helplessly addicted to being in a relationship.
[2073.18 --> 2074.92]  Like, I think since I turned...
[2074.92 --> 2077.08]  Yeah, I got mad at him because I was like, you know what?
[2077.12 --> 2078.68]  If I died, you'd, like, date immediately.
[2079.42 --> 2081.30]  No, I wouldn't.
[2081.44 --> 2082.10]  I would be...
[2082.10 --> 2084.14]  I'd be trying to pick up the pieces of my life.
[2084.20 --> 2085.68]  I don't even know what bank I use.
[2085.68 --> 2092.24]  Like, I would actually have some stuff to deal with for quite an extended period of time.
[2092.36 --> 2094.12]  I have a folder on my computer called If I Die.
[2094.14 --> 2096.70]  You haven't updated it in, like, nine years.
[2096.82 --> 2098.04]  Okay, I'll update it for you, okay?
[2098.22 --> 2099.18]  That's not the point.
[2099.26 --> 2100.00]  Just don't die.
[2100.26 --> 2101.32]  This is a real thing.
[2101.50 --> 2102.84]  No, it's actually a real thing.
[2102.88 --> 2106.34]  She definitely has that folder, but she definitely hasn't looked at it in almost a decade.
[2106.76 --> 2107.40]  I've been busy.
[2107.96 --> 2108.70]  Yeah, me too.
[2109.16 --> 2109.54]  I don't know.
[2109.64 --> 2110.44]  What would you do, Luke?
[2110.44 --> 2110.92]  Luke?
[2111.92 --> 2114.28]  Uh, I don't know.
[2115.50 --> 2117.46]  I genuinely have no idea.
[2117.68 --> 2119.44]  Because, like, I...
[2119.44 --> 2125.62]  I've told Linus some of the stories of how I, like, tried to meet people in the past.
[2125.74 --> 2133.18]  Like, one of the silly things that I did that worked was I was on a bus and someone sat down next to me.
[2133.32 --> 2136.86]  And I just, like, held my phone fairly far out so it'd be really easy for them to read.
[2137.04 --> 2138.92]  And started texting about how they were, like, cute.
[2138.92 --> 2140.68]  And then they...
[2140.68 --> 2141.30]  That's actually pretty clever.
[2141.42 --> 2144.12]  And then they read it and were, like, hey, like, blah, blah, blah.
[2144.16 --> 2145.26]  And I was, like, yeah, do you want to go out?
[2145.28 --> 2145.88]  And they're, like, yeah, sure.
[2146.08 --> 2146.54]  I like it.
[2146.64 --> 2147.00]  It worked.
[2147.06 --> 2148.20]  But, like, how do you...
[2148.20 --> 2150.80]  How do you create that scenario?
[2150.96 --> 2153.18]  Yeah, was that, like, on the way to school or something like that?
[2153.20 --> 2154.00]  Because school is totally...
[2154.00 --> 2154.40]  It wasn't.
[2154.52 --> 2156.02]  I was going to hang out with someone.
[2156.12 --> 2160.70]  But I was going to hang out with someone that was at UBC and at a time that I was university age.
[2161.20 --> 2163.76]  So it sort of worked out because there's a bus at UBC.
[2163.76 --> 2164.20]  Yeah.
[2164.40 --> 2170.26]  So, like, how do you make sure that, you know, the right person actually happens to sit next to you on a bus?
[2170.32 --> 2172.62]  Like, this is such a random scenario that you can't plan for.
[2173.04 --> 2174.28]  And then I'd have...
[2174.28 --> 2175.80]  Well, you can plan for it a little bit.
[2175.82 --> 2176.76]  Oh, that's what I did.
[2177.34 --> 2180.96]  I saw Linus in class and I was like, hmm, I think he normally sits there.
[2180.98 --> 2182.28]  I'm going to go sit in that row.
[2182.40 --> 2184.64]  And I sat kind of away, like, slightly away.
[2184.72 --> 2185.22]  Okay, okay.
[2185.46 --> 2186.84]  But here's a weird thing, though.
[2186.92 --> 2189.80]  So you can weight the dice a little bit.
[2189.80 --> 2191.64]  Here's Linus and I, though.
[2191.78 --> 2198.88]  As a guy, if you go on a bus and you see a girl sitting beside herself, generally you try to not sit right next to them.
[2199.32 --> 2200.80]  Because it can be seen as, like...
[2200.80 --> 2202.64]  Well, actually, he didn't sit right next to me.
[2202.74 --> 2203.36]  He sat...
[2203.36 --> 2204.76]  He didn't notice me at first and he sat...
[2204.76 --> 2205.16]  No, no, I know.
[2205.34 --> 2206.88]  You're saying you sat next to him, right?
[2206.88 --> 2208.62]  No, so I sat in the row first.
[2208.78 --> 2210.04]  And then he didn't notice me.
[2210.08 --> 2211.38]  He came in and sat further in.
[2211.54 --> 2215.22]  And then he noticed me and then started talking to me and then moved closer.
[2217.08 --> 2217.44]  Yeah.
[2217.44 --> 2218.94]  So you can kind of play it.
[2218.94 --> 2219.94]  Linus has the riz, dude.
[2221.02 --> 2222.54]  But honestly, like...
[2222.54 --> 2223.66]  I mean, that's a fair move, though.
[2223.68 --> 2226.90]  If you're in conversation and then you happen to move closer, that seems fine.
[2227.12 --> 2228.30]  But, like, in general...
[2228.30 --> 2229.70]  But school makes that so easy.
[2229.76 --> 2230.12]  Yes.
[2230.16 --> 2234.12]  Because we were sitting in the same class learning the same subject material.
[2234.62 --> 2237.40]  Man, like, in the real world, when are you going to have that opportunity?
[2237.54 --> 2238.18]  That's tough.
[2238.60 --> 2238.98]  I don't know.
[2239.06 --> 2242.28]  I feel like it's even harder for us because, like, I never really dated.
[2242.50 --> 2244.40]  I've never had to do that whole thing.
[2244.40 --> 2246.24]  So I don't even know.
[2246.24 --> 2254.96]  Yeah, I mean, if I had to give, like, the best advice that I possibly could, it would be find the awesome one and then, like, lock her up before anyone else even gets a shot at her.
[2255.76 --> 2257.66]  I mean, it worked great for me.
[2257.74 --> 2259.74]  So, you know, go for it.
[2259.74 --> 2260.10]  I do.
[2260.30 --> 2261.74]  I would say, like, I don't...
[2262.74 --> 2266.90]  Some, like, advice to younger people, I guess, is to...
[2268.02 --> 2269.68]  Once you're at an appropriate age...
[2269.68 --> 2270.90]  Okay, not lock her up.
[2270.96 --> 2272.12]  Like, lock that up.
[2272.48 --> 2273.62]  Oh, I knew what he meant.
[2273.62 --> 2275.08]  Come on, you guys.
[2275.18 --> 2276.32]  Come on, you guys.
[2276.64 --> 2279.06]  But once you're at appropriate age, date.
[2279.76 --> 2282.62]  And, like, move on early if you don't like the person.
[2282.70 --> 2285.02]  Start trying to learn the things that you like about people.
[2285.38 --> 2288.60]  And understand what you yourself need in a relationship.
[2288.90 --> 2289.80]  What you can provide.
[2289.86 --> 2294.16]  Because you'll start recognizing as well, like, okay, I'm not good at these things.
[2294.16 --> 2299.74]  And if you end up dating a person who clearly needs those things, well, then you should probably just end it and move on and find another one.
[2299.80 --> 2306.00]  Because when you're in, say, university, this is, like you're saying, the easiest time to, like, find people.
[2306.16 --> 2307.56]  You'll find immediately.
[2307.94 --> 2311.16]  The day you exit university, it becomes infinitely harder.
[2311.30 --> 2313.30]  So what do you guys think about dating friends of friends?
[2314.16 --> 2315.38]  Because I feel like that can be...
[2315.38 --> 2315.72]  That gets dangerous.
[2315.72 --> 2317.72]  I honestly...
[2318.36 --> 2320.80]  Nothing against any of my friends that I've ever had.
[2320.94 --> 2324.64]  But honestly, I'd probably rather have an AI recommend someone to me.
[2326.34 --> 2326.74]  Seriously.
[2327.76 --> 2331.76]  Because at least an AI is not going to have some fucking, like, agenda.
[2334.62 --> 2335.10]  Yeah.
[2336.20 --> 2336.64]  Yeah.
[2336.94 --> 2338.14]  Yeah, that can always be weird.
[2339.10 --> 2340.84]  Okay, well, you know, playoff hockey is on now.
[2340.90 --> 2341.82]  Going to sports events.
[2342.30 --> 2342.92]  Is that a thing?
[2343.62 --> 2344.36]  Going to concerts.
[2344.74 --> 2345.30]  I don't know.
[2345.30 --> 2346.80]  How do you meet someone at a concert?
[2346.92 --> 2348.10]  I can't even hear anybody.
[2348.24 --> 2349.84]  And almost everyone there's in, like, a pod.
[2350.20 --> 2350.44]  Yeah.
[2350.44 --> 2352.48]  And it's difficult to approach someone when they're in a pod.
[2352.50 --> 2352.92]  Concert's bad.
[2352.98 --> 2354.02]  But what about sports events?
[2354.42 --> 2354.78]  You...
[2354.78 --> 2359.08]  I think you specifically said you would do events and adventures, which is a local company
[2359.08 --> 2360.00]  that's...
[2360.00 --> 2361.02]  Yeah, I heard it on the radio.
[2362.36 --> 2364.02]  Typical millennial stuff right there.
[2364.10 --> 2366.74]  I heard about this way to meet people on the radio.
[2367.64 --> 2368.64]  That's how I heard of them, too.
[2368.86 --> 2369.12]  Okay.
[2369.38 --> 2369.70]  Okay.
[2370.02 --> 2372.90]  I have a thing for events and adventures.
[2373.24 --> 2375.20]  I was planning on doing this.
[2376.02 --> 2377.14]  Before I ended up with Emma.
[2377.56 --> 2378.00]  Really?
[2378.00 --> 2379.42]  Because I heard it on the radio.
[2380.22 --> 2383.64]  I used to listen to the Fox all the time.
[2384.30 --> 2386.52]  Before, like, you know, Bluetooth in my car.
[2386.52 --> 2387.50]  The Fox is not Fox News.
[2387.86 --> 2388.14]  No.
[2388.30 --> 2389.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2389.34 --> 2390.30]  It's a local radio station.
[2390.38 --> 2392.36]  It has nothing to do with American news.
[2392.88 --> 2394.60]  We are, in fact, Canadian.
[2395.48 --> 2397.76]  But it's so lowly rated.
[2398.52 --> 2399.46]  I never looked into it at all.
[2399.46 --> 2402.00]  It seems like such an easy thing to do well, right?
[2402.18 --> 2402.44]  Yeah.
[2402.52 --> 2403.42]  All you have to do is...
[2403.42 --> 2405.00]  It's only 3.2 stars.
[2405.34 --> 2405.54]  Oh.
[2405.54 --> 2409.48]  So like how did you, how did they, how do you do this?
[2409.60 --> 2415.84]  And then a lot of the trips, they're like, or the events and adventures are like, hey, we're going to go fly to some like country.
[2416.48 --> 2416.76]  Really?
[2416.98 --> 2419.52]  So the cost is like, whoa.
[2419.52 --> 2419.92]  That's crazy.
[2419.98 --> 2425.58]  Like I was thinking like, hey, we go, I don't know, to this lake or something.
[2425.58 --> 2425.88]  Yeah.
[2426.20 --> 2426.38]  Yeah.
[2426.38 --> 2428.02]  I thought it was just doing something.
[2428.12 --> 2429.64]  Like we go do the cheese tasting.
[2429.78 --> 2430.44]  Like, I don't know.
[2430.68 --> 2435.40]  I think they do that sometimes, but they also like, like if you look here, I'm going to go on their website.
[2435.90 --> 2436.82]  Look at like this one.
[2436.92 --> 2439.32]  This is clearly like they're, they're out there.
[2439.98 --> 2441.62]  I think that's Banff, Alberta.
[2441.94 --> 2442.86]  Like these are big.
[2443.78 --> 2445.00]  These are big trips.
[2446.48 --> 2446.86]  Events.
[2447.06 --> 2447.38]  Let's see.
[2447.56 --> 2448.28]  Virtual events.
[2448.40 --> 2448.68]  Okay.
[2449.08 --> 2450.28]  That feels like online dating.
[2451.34 --> 2452.04]  Hot air ballooning.
[2452.10 --> 2452.22]  Wine.
[2452.22 --> 2452.50]  Okay.
[2452.58 --> 2453.72]  These are a little bit more reasonable.
[2456.84 --> 2460.50]  Another thing that I think is kind of weird about a scenario like this though, personally,
[2460.50 --> 2466.44]  is when everyone there, you know, everyone there has like the mission of.
[2466.92 --> 2467.36]  Yeah.
[2467.92 --> 2469.36]  It, that makes it weird too.
[2469.54 --> 2472.20]  Like does it, does it stink of desperation or like.
[2472.32 --> 2473.90]  Like something's kind of weird.
[2473.90 --> 2474.44]  Smell like.
[2474.80 --> 2475.06]  Yeah.
[2475.08 --> 2475.38]  You know?
[2475.60 --> 2483.08]  Like I have never personally met someone who said like, oh yeah, I, I got with my partner
[2483.08 --> 2485.96]  through this like matchmaking thing.
[2486.32 --> 2488.38]  I've met people that say they met them through online dating.
[2488.38 --> 2493.04]  I've met people who, you know, all the, the gamut of other things, but events and adventures,
[2493.20 --> 2494.42]  other various matchmaking services.
[2494.42 --> 2497.26]  I've never once heard of someone be like, yeah, it was through this thing.
[2497.88 --> 2499.80]  Is that because they're trying to hide it?
[2499.86 --> 2501.06]  Or is that because it doesn't work?
[2501.16 --> 2501.96]  I have no idea.
[2502.06 --> 2502.30]  I don't know.
[2504.38 --> 2506.70]  I wish we had better answers for you guys.
[2507.18 --> 2508.74]  It sounds like it's horrible.
[2509.14 --> 2509.70]  Like I.
[2510.74 --> 2511.18]  My.
[2512.76 --> 2515.22]  She probably won't watch this, so it's probably okay.
[2515.22 --> 2522.36]  Uh, my older sister told me about a thing she heard and she basically said something
[2522.36 --> 2529.64]  along the lines of, uh, dating in your thirties is like going to the thrift store and finding
[2529.64 --> 2536.06]  the least broken, disgusting thing and taking it home and hoping it fits.
[2537.54 --> 2545.20]  And I was like, I wanted to cry for her because like, she's, she's not making a
[2545.20 --> 2545.50]  joke.
[2545.50 --> 2546.58]  Like she's, uh.
[2546.82 --> 2547.00]  Yeah.
[2547.00 --> 2549.58]  I've heard, I've heard thirties plus dating is just atrocious.
[2549.58 --> 2549.86]  Yeah.
[2549.86 --> 2554.34]  She's, she's, she's found it challenging and it's, it sucks because she's such a beautiful
[2554.34 --> 2555.20]  soul, right?
[2555.22 --> 2556.58]  Like she's, uh, she's awesome.
[2557.34 --> 2563.46]  Um, and I, uh, yeah, I just, yeah, it just made me, it just made me sad.
[2564.00 --> 2568.92]  Um, Avery studios says in your forties, it just gets hilarious and honest and almost easier.
[2568.92 --> 2569.40]  I think.
[2569.88 --> 2572.12]  I mean, that's, that's kind of interesting perspective.
[2572.12 --> 2575.24]  That's because that's when you're hitting a higher rate of divorcees.
[2576.10 --> 2577.42]  Oh, that kind of makes sense.
[2577.42 --> 2577.98]  So the pool.
[2577.98 --> 2579.98]  I've heard thirties is like the dead zone.
[2580.04 --> 2581.80]  So the pool opens up again.
[2581.88 --> 2582.08]  Yeah.
[2582.92 --> 2584.06]  This is what I've heard at least.
[2584.42 --> 2584.70]  Interesting.
[2585.14 --> 2590.34]  I, I, my understanding is there's, my understanding is that thirties is a dead zone and then like
[2590.34 --> 2592.30]  fifties and sixties is a dead zone.
[2592.30 --> 2594.34]  And then you have retirement home flings.
[2594.66 --> 2594.86]  Yeah.
[2595.10 --> 2595.90]  I've heard of them.
[2596.12 --> 2597.40]  That's like totally a thing.
[2597.42 --> 2599.66]  I've heard there's a lot of banging in the old folks home.
[2602.62 --> 2606.36]  I've heard that from a lot of people, including people that work at old folks homes.
[2606.44 --> 2608.06]  So I like totally believe that it's real.
[2608.60 --> 2613.68]  Um, birdie num nums says, uh, you're much more likely to meet someone doing something
[2613.68 --> 2616.48]  you love to do or simply being fully aware of your surroundings.
[2616.48 --> 2617.62]  I agree.
[2617.92 --> 2624.72]  However, considering the audience and most people watching right now and myself, what
[2624.72 --> 2625.90]  do I love to do?
[2626.28 --> 2628.42]  Um, play video games.
[2628.78 --> 2634.44]  You want to have a wow wedding and, and, and working out and like working, no one, everyone
[2634.44 --> 2635.60]  is headphones on.
[2635.90 --> 2637.46]  You don't want to talk to anybody.
[2637.94 --> 2639.78]  Most people are sweaty and gross.
[2639.96 --> 2646.38]  And the line between like a, like a playful banter at the gym and being like a creepy weirdo
[2646.38 --> 2648.46]  at the gym is like, is thin.
[2648.54 --> 2651.74]  And honestly, it's best off to just not at all.
[2651.82 --> 2653.14]  Just focus on what you're doing.
[2653.96 --> 2655.02]  Get your job done and get out.
[2655.02 --> 2659.12]  Like it's my, look, I don't, I don't do gym, gym.
[2659.30 --> 2660.78]  I do badminton gym.
[2661.08 --> 2666.22]  So I'm just kind of, I'm speaking out of turn a little bit here, but my understanding
[2666.22 --> 2671.46]  is like at the gym, you're pretty much not even supposed to like notice if a girl is
[2671.46 --> 2671.90]  hot.
[2672.28 --> 2676.34]  Like you're not supposed to be looking to be essentially honest because like eyes
[2676.34 --> 2677.48]  on the highway kind of thing.
[2677.48 --> 2681.88]  If you think about it, a lot of movements that you have to do, if you're properly doing
[2681.88 --> 2687.48]  movements, kind of sexual are going to end up being things that put body parts in areas
[2687.48 --> 2688.38]  that look attractive.
[2688.64 --> 2690.90]  So they're not doing that for you.
[2691.00 --> 2694.88]  They're doing that because they're trying to keep their form correct and do this exercise
[2694.88 --> 2695.40]  properly.
[2695.40 --> 2699.54]  So you have to understand, you have to like clue into that.
[2699.54 --> 2705.96]  And the best way to avoid any misunderstandings there is to just stay focused on what you're
[2705.96 --> 2706.28]  doing.
[2706.86 --> 2710.00]  Like one of the things that I do is either straight in front or up.
[2710.64 --> 2711.04]  Yeah.
[2711.22 --> 2713.38]  Your eyeline is straight in front or it's up.
[2713.46 --> 2716.10]  Cause as long as you're not looking down, you're good.
[2717.08 --> 2717.88]  Or side.
[2718.00 --> 2722.22]  Like if you're doing a workout and you're looking at someone on the side, right?
[2722.22 --> 2725.68]  Like it's so, but like you can, you better be hot.
[2725.78 --> 2727.58]  You better be like Ryan Reynolds hot.
[2727.58 --> 2729.04]  If you're going to try and pull that off.
[2729.12 --> 2730.54]  So things can get pretty monotonous, right?
[2730.56 --> 2733.06]  Like you're, you're doing the same movement, three sets of 12.
[2733.10 --> 2734.46]  You're doing it 36 times.
[2734.46 --> 2736.54]  You might get kind of bored part way through.
[2737.24 --> 2738.32]  Don't let it happen.
[2738.60 --> 2739.40]  Straightforward or up.
[2739.64 --> 2742.20]  If someone is in your eyeline straightforward, look up.
[2742.26 --> 2742.44]  Okay.
[2742.54 --> 2744.12]  Do the same rules apply for girls?
[2745.00 --> 2746.36]  Uh, probably not to be honest.
[2746.36 --> 2746.68]  Yeah.
[2746.94 --> 2750.42]  Like would it bother you guys if a girl was at the gym watching you guys work out?
[2750.42 --> 2751.94]  I mean, it depends, right?
[2752.00 --> 2758.30]  Like if it's like, and it's like a whole gaggle of them, then yeah, that's pretty uncomfortable.
[2758.48 --> 2759.36]  Are they making fun of me?
[2759.50 --> 2763.76]  In general, I don't think it really bothers me too much, but you do have to understand that
[2763.76 --> 2765.56]  like the playing field is not the same.
[2766.30 --> 2767.42]  So I don't know.
[2767.52 --> 2769.46]  I don't think I really notice it a ton to be honest.
[2769.52 --> 2769.96]  I don't really care.
[2769.98 --> 2770.66]  Because you're not looking.
[2770.82 --> 2771.04]  Yeah.
[2771.28 --> 2772.54]  What a f***ing Chad.
[2773.28 --> 2774.96]  It's like, you know, whatever.
[2775.38 --> 2776.72]  Don't even notice it anymore.
[2776.72 --> 2777.62]  I do what I'm going to do.
[2777.80 --> 2778.20]  It's fine.
[2778.20 --> 2782.80]  Uh, we've got Wardus asking, what about dating at work?
[2783.00 --> 2783.84]  Is that okay?
[2783.90 --> 2784.70]  Was it ever okay?
[2784.86 --> 2787.20]  So man, that is...
[2788.08 --> 2789.02]  I've never been interested.
[2789.34 --> 2792.36]  That's always seemed like a major stay away from it to me.
[2792.42 --> 2793.90]  It is so full of pitfalls.
[2794.24 --> 2801.48]  Um, of the three of us, Yvonne probably has the most knowledge when it comes to, um, like
[2801.48 --> 2806.62]  HR, legal compliance and like all the, all the company side stuff that there is.
[2806.62 --> 2814.10]  Um, what I will say is that if there is any kind of direct or even indirect supervisory
[2814.10 --> 2819.94]  relationship, that, that's not good.
[2820.08 --> 2820.60]  Don't do it.
[2820.74 --> 2821.80]  That's not good for anybody.
[2821.82 --> 2823.18]  Don't do it for so many reasons.
[2823.18 --> 2830.96]  And like, even outside of that, man, like I, I was, I was reading about, um, uh,
[2830.96 --> 2832.32]  Oh, something you can do though.
[2832.38 --> 2832.56]  Yeah.
[2832.56 --> 2839.30]  If you become friends with them, potentially their friends, but not them.
[2839.30 --> 2839.78]  Okay.
[2839.78 --> 2840.10]  Okay.
[2840.12 --> 2843.86]  So your advice is to become friends with people so you can do their friends.
[2844.58 --> 2845.68]  I mean, thanks Luke.
[2845.86 --> 2849.24]  Just that's, that's a super normal form of dating is getting recommendations from your
[2849.24 --> 2849.52]  friends.
[2849.52 --> 2852.80]  This is actually, you're trying to, you're trying to make it weird, but this is actually
[2852.80 --> 2853.52]  super normal.
[2853.58 --> 2857.50]  I am trying to make it weird, but like, yeah, just, you know, I was reading about how,
[2857.50 --> 2861.86]  uh, Kaylee Cuoco, I forget how to pronounce her name, but Penny from the big bang theory
[2861.86 --> 2867.36]  and Johnny Galecki who plays Leonard on the big bang theory, they, um, had a, their relationship
[2867.36 --> 2870.94]  on the show and they had a relationship in real life.
[2871.34 --> 2878.98]  And after their relationship in real life ended, they at times had to do, we're in a relationship
[2878.98 --> 2880.64]  on the show things together.
[2882.00 --> 2889.42]  Obviously that's a super extreme example, but like, even if there's no supervisory relationship,
[2890.36 --> 2891.38]  think about that.
[2891.38 --> 2897.06]  Nothing, nothing is a sure thing, you know, no matter how compatible you guys think you
[2897.06 --> 2898.70]  are in the first week or two.
[2899.24 --> 2904.68]  Um, so before you take that step, consider that you might have to work on a project with
[2904.68 --> 2908.92]  this person after some kind of bitter, messy breakup.
[2911.14 --> 2914.76]  I'm like, if you hate your job, then like whatever, who cares?
[2914.92 --> 2917.44]  And then you can just leave your job and get a different job or whatever after.
[2917.56 --> 2920.82]  But if you like your job and you think maybe they like the job too.
[2920.82 --> 2925.50]  You could end up kind of stuck with each other in a really awful, icky way for an extended
[2925.50 --> 2926.16]  period of time.
[2926.34 --> 2926.48]  Yeah.
[2926.64 --> 2928.08]  And some people pull it off, obviously.
[2928.56 --> 2928.80]  Yeah.
[2928.80 --> 2931.34]  But it's just, it's very, it's dangerous.
[2931.86 --> 2935.38]  And even for those that are successful, there's a lot of couples who don't make it when they
[2935.38 --> 2935.88]  work together.
[2936.12 --> 2938.14]  There's just too much of overlap in their life.
[2939.26 --> 2940.70]  Was that a concern for you guys?
[2940.70 --> 2946.94]  Um, I feel like I remember conversations around this like 2013 era, but I don't, I don't
[2946.94 --> 2949.00]  remember the like details or conclusions.
[2949.00 --> 2950.62]  I just think it was something that was discussed.
[2950.70 --> 2952.24]  I'm very curious about why you laughed.
[2952.32 --> 2953.02]  You go first.
[2955.26 --> 2956.32]  This is great.
[2956.64 --> 2958.22]  You should, you should be on the show more often.
[2958.64 --> 2959.44]  Oh man.
[2960.92 --> 2961.78]  That's a good point.
[2961.78 --> 2966.28]  It puts significant strain on our relationship at times.
[2966.64 --> 2966.94]  Yeah.
[2969.28 --> 2969.84]  That's fair.
[2969.96 --> 2970.42]  That's fair.
[2970.42 --> 2976.10]  I feel like we are kind of a different couple though.
[2976.14 --> 2978.76]  We do do a lot more things together than most people.
[2979.08 --> 2981.44]  Um, I think, uh, what, what do they call it?
[2981.52 --> 2981.96]  Enmeshment.
[2982.08 --> 2985.34]  I think that's supposed to be an unhealthy relationship style, but I'm pretty sure that's
[2985.34 --> 2985.68]  us.
[2987.82 --> 2990.16]  Man, you can't be admitting that shit on my show.
[2990.72 --> 2991.30]  Okay, fine.
[2991.42 --> 2992.80]  I'll leave my foot to sleep anyway.
[2994.64 --> 3000.00]  Enmeshment is a concept in psychology or psychotherapy where families, uh, have personal boundaries
[3000.00 --> 3007.20]  that are diffused subsystems, undifferentiated and over concern for others leads to a loss
[3007.20 --> 3008.26]  of autonomous development.
[3009.62 --> 3011.46]  I don't know if that's a hundred percent fair.
[3012.34 --> 3017.76]  I think, I think, uh, I think Linus has significantly more autonomous development with Yvonne.
[3020.64 --> 3022.20]  If I can, if I can project.
[3022.68 --> 3022.94]  Yeah.
[3023.12 --> 3025.58]  I, uh, well, well, it's not the, not the autonomy.
[3025.66 --> 3028.14]  I definitely develop more with Yvonne in my life.
[3028.22 --> 3028.68]  I would be.
[3028.76 --> 3029.18]  Maybe not autonomous.
[3029.18 --> 3031.72]  I would be a stunted boy if it wasn't for her.
[3032.04 --> 3036.16]  Anyway, I assume you dropped by to say that you're leaving and that making sure that I
[3036.16 --> 3036.74]  have a ride home.
[3038.58 --> 3038.94]  Yeah.
[3039.02 --> 3040.00]  I know about the land.
[3040.06 --> 3041.56]  I want to get there sooner rather than later.
[3042.00 --> 3042.22]  Yeah.
[3042.40 --> 3042.76]  All right.
[3043.28 --> 3043.64]  Bye.
[3044.56 --> 3045.62]  Thanks for jumping in.
[3048.20 --> 3048.56]  Right.
[3048.64 --> 3049.42]  We should do sponsors.
[3049.74 --> 3051.72]  I think we also left hanging merch messages.
[3051.84 --> 3052.58]  Yeah, we'll get to them.
[3052.86 --> 3055.18]  The show is brought to you today by Squarespace.

[3108.00 --> 3108.70]  top of your results?

[3117.48 --> 3118.40]  The process is simple.

[3148.72 --> 3151.32]  The third sponsor of the show is Magical.
[3152.40 --> 3153.34]  Really magical.
[3153.70 --> 3154.78]  We all know time is money.
[3154.78 --> 3159.06]  And with such a limited amount of both of those things, don't let it go to waste.
[3159.42 --> 3163.74]  With Magical's free AI-powered browser extension, you can shave a few precious hours off of
[3163.74 --> 3164.26]  your tasks.
[3164.72 --> 3166.40]  That way you can maybe catch up on some sleep.
[3166.80 --> 3168.44]  This guy looks like he might need some.
[3168.58 --> 3169.28]  Thanks for that, Dennis.
[3169.68 --> 3173.52]  All you have to do is install the extension, set up templates that will help you autofill text
[3173.52 --> 3177.06]  instead of typing out the same thing over and over again, and then access them with a
[3177.06 --> 3178.26]  simple keyboard shortcut.
[3178.80 --> 3183.18]  Its AI-powered features can even help automatically populate text if you're just having one of those
[3183.18 --> 3183.60]  days.
[3183.60 --> 3184.78]  We all have them.
[3185.86 --> 3186.66]  Trust me.

[3201.10 --> 3202.90]  like email clients and CRM platforms.
[3203.38 --> 3204.72]  So put on your robe and wizard hat.
[3204.84 --> 3206.78]  Go to Magical slash WAN show.
[3207.34 --> 3207.54]  What?
[3208.10 --> 3211.54]  Go to Magical slash WAN show.
[3211.54 --> 3212.64]  Um, okay.
[3212.72 --> 3213.10]  You know what?
[3213.14 --> 3217.40]  Go to the link in the video description to see how Magical can save you valuable time.
[3218.40 --> 3218.94]  All right.
[3219.00 --> 3219.84]  What's our next?
[3220.00 --> 3220.20]  Okay.
[3220.28 --> 3221.82]  I guess we should finish off another merch message.
[3221.92 --> 3222.40]  Dan, hit me.
[3222.60 --> 3222.78]  Yeah.
[3222.78 --> 3224.86]  More merch messages.
[3225.16 --> 3225.26]  Sorry.
[3225.34 --> 3227.54]  My things are all out of order now.
[3227.94 --> 3228.90]  Hey, DLL.
[3229.24 --> 3233.46]  Luke, why'd LTT go with Shopify instead of something like WooCommerce?
[3233.74 --> 3238.60]  I manage an online store with 500-ish products, and they picked Woo before I took over.
[3238.60 --> 3240.42]  But non-tech people struggle with it.
[3242.06 --> 3243.00]  Uh, I don't know.
[3243.70 --> 3244.96]  I don't think I made that decision.
[3245.16 --> 3246.20]  I don't think I was part of that decision.
[3246.36 --> 3247.20]  I think it was a good decision.
[3247.30 --> 3255.92]  I think that was Nick, and, um, I was involved, and there might have been some other parties
[3255.92 --> 3257.26]  involved, but...
[3257.26 --> 3258.82]  I was just float playing at that time.
[3258.98 --> 3259.84]  Um, but...
[3259.84 --> 3260.86]  The features looked good.
[3261.18 --> 3263.20]  The customizability looked good.
[3263.20 --> 3267.38]  The functionality without investing in development looked adequate.
[3268.20 --> 3271.26]  Um, I think that was a pretty heavy reason why at the time.
[3271.44 --> 3271.54]  Yeah.
[3271.56 --> 3276.06]  I don't think them being our Canadian bros was a factor, but, like...
[3276.06 --> 3276.50]  It's neat.
[3276.68 --> 3279.10]  They may be tech bros, but at least they're Canadian tech bros.
[3279.30 --> 3279.48]  Yeah.
[3279.58 --> 3279.72]  Yeah.
[3279.72 --> 3280.36]  I don't know.
[3281.10 --> 3283.20]  We, we, we were happy with the features.
[3283.48 --> 3285.68]  Not, not saying anything negative about WooCommerce.
[3285.80 --> 3286.52]  We just like the site.
[3286.96 --> 3288.78]  But we, uh, yeah, we like the site.
[3289.70 --> 3290.60]  Shopify's been great.
[3290.94 --> 3291.62]  A great partner.
[3291.62 --> 3295.76]  I would, I would, now that I am influencing some of those decisions, I would, I would
[3295.76 --> 3296.04]  make it again.
[3296.04 --> 3297.54]  They've been a great partner in some ways.
[3302.44 --> 3302.80]  What?
[3303.08 --> 3303.70]  I don't know.
[3303.94 --> 3305.82]  I feel like it's a jab, and I don't even know why.
[3309.22 --> 3310.12]  Moving on.
[3311.08 --> 3313.92]  Hey, DLL, my second lanyard is about to break at the swivel.
[3314.24 --> 3318.54]  If you had the chance to change or add a feature to an existing product, what would it
[3318.54 --> 3318.86]  be?
[3318.86 --> 3321.24]  Uh, backpack, second layer excluded.
[3321.62 --> 3322.12]  Um.
[3323.96 --> 3324.44]  Um.
[3326.18 --> 3328.48]  Oh man, that's a, that's a good question.
[3328.60 --> 3330.50]  What would I add to an existing product?
[3330.64 --> 3332.64]  I mean, nothing's perfect, obviously.
[3333.54 --> 3334.98]  Pretty happy with most of the stuff though.
[3335.16 --> 3336.30]  I would add.
[3337.92 --> 3338.44]  Uh.
[3338.44 --> 3338.88]  Uh.
[3339.24 --> 3339.58]  Okay.
[3339.78 --> 3346.78]  How do I answer this question without teasing, you know, like a V2 of something?
[3346.90 --> 3347.18]  Uh.
[3347.24 --> 3347.48]  Oh.
[3347.78 --> 3352.06]  Oh, I would definitely, I would definitely add more options for water bottle lids.
[3352.70 --> 3353.04]  Uh.
[3353.04 --> 3358.16]  I think that's something that if we had the same inventory management capabilities that
[3358.16 --> 3362.20]  we have today, that we would have been able to tackle in the past so you can like mix and
[3362.20 --> 3363.22]  match your lid with your order.
[3363.38 --> 3365.20]  That's, that's something that I'd like to go back and undo.
[3365.74 --> 3366.24]  Yeah, that's fair.
[3366.30 --> 3366.72]  That makes sense.
[3366.76 --> 3367.00]  All right.
[3367.00 --> 3373.34]  Hey guys, I mentioned the FF Tactics mod reached to, reached the future to Linus a while back.
[3373.60 --> 3374.46]  Still recommend it.
[3374.80 --> 3378.00]  Luke, we modify the game's code directly in MIPS Assembly.
[3378.28 --> 3380.40]  Is this a useful code language to know?
[3380.96 --> 3381.36]  Uh.
[3382.96 --> 3384.50]  I mean, it seems to be working for you.
[3385.82 --> 3386.26]  Yeah.
[3386.54 --> 3388.66]  I mean, I, I don't know.
[3388.98 --> 3390.68]  I'm not very familiar with it.
[3390.68 --> 3398.64]  Um, one of the ways that you can try to find out is try to do some digging on what companies
[3398.64 --> 3400.30]  use it and why.
[3400.80 --> 3405.22]  Um, like one of the reasons why people talk about COBOL a lot is because it's relatively
[3405.22 --> 3407.12]  heavily used in the financial sector.
[3407.70 --> 3415.06]  Um, big money there, important things running on it, and companies that are going to be willing
[3415.06 --> 3417.50]  to shell out a decent amount to get stuff done.
[3418.12 --> 3418.86]  Can confirm.
[3419.00 --> 3420.08]  That's still on my to-do list.
[3420.28 --> 3420.58]  Nice.
[3420.58 --> 3422.18]  Haven't gotten to it yet, but it's on there.
[3422.76 --> 3423.74]  What are we hearing?
[3423.92 --> 3424.46]  What is that?
[3425.02 --> 3425.74]  That's a bird.
[3426.02 --> 3426.38]  Wow.
[3426.62 --> 3429.00]  Microsoft adds, adds, adds, adds.
[3429.28 --> 3433.54]  Microsoft has announced that it will be adding a Game Pass recommendation card to a panel
[3433.54 --> 3436.48]  in the Windows 11 settings homepage for users who game on their PC.
[3437.02 --> 3439.34]  This ad will also appear on home and pro-
[3439.34 --> 3445.64]  Will also only appear on pro and home versions of Windows 11, and then only if users are signed
[3445.64 --> 3446.74]  into their Microsoft account.
[3446.74 --> 3450.18]  If the user already uses Game Pass on that computer, then the recommendation card will
[3450.18 --> 3453.02]  instead advertise a new or potentially interesting game.
[3453.02 --> 3458.40]  Likewise, the Windows 11 PC Manager tool, a utility slash security tool that's available
[3458.40 --> 3463.70]  in only certain regions, now suggests as part of its repair tip section that users can repair
[3463.70 --> 3466.86]  their system by switching back to Bing as their default search engine.
[3466.86 --> 3472.50]  These things aren't directly related to each other, other than that they're just more obnoxious
[3472.50 --> 3480.16]  ways that Microsoft is making Windows not just shut up, get out of my way, and let me use
[3480.16 --> 3481.02]  my computer.
[3481.02 --> 3487.36]  This is software that, for me anyway, I paid $100 for.
[3488.36 --> 3489.24]  F*** off!
[3491.24 --> 3495.30]  Actually though, like if you guys want to have a tiered system, you want to have free Windows
[3495.30 --> 3498.10]  and it's full of all this bulls***, no problem.
[3499.32 --> 3503.70]  If you don't pay for the product, you are the product, blah blah blah blah blah blah, fine.
[3503.70 --> 3510.46]  But when I pay $100 for a piece of software, which to me is a significant amount of money,
[3510.90 --> 3513.42]  I expect your ads to f*** off.
[3513.56 --> 3514.28]  Completely agreed.
[3516.54 --> 3518.02]  That is all I have to say about that.
[3518.50 --> 3518.72]  Yeah.
[3518.98 --> 3522.24]  I have a message in Flowplane chat from Joshua Carroll.
[3522.78 --> 3523.26]  It said,
[3523.26 --> 3525.34]  The undeleting pics just happened to me.
[3525.60 --> 3528.66]  After seeing the show title, I started the update on my iPhone.
[3528.66 --> 3531.24]  The update just got over and it's real.
[3531.42 --> 3535.52]  Pics of my ex, including suggestive ones, are back in my camera roll.
[3535.84 --> 3537.06]  That could have been awkward, man.
[3537.24 --> 3537.60]  P.S.
[3537.62 --> 3539.68]  I have my iCloud photos turned off.
[3543.96 --> 3544.48]  Yeah.
[3545.06 --> 3545.44]  What?
[3545.74 --> 3546.10]  Yeah.
[3547.50 --> 3548.88]  It's not syncing?
[3549.58 --> 3551.76]  It's like finding...
[3551.76 --> 3553.70]  So it might be the pointer thing.
[3553.76 --> 3554.74]  Yeah, my old pointers.
[3555.02 --> 3555.26]  Yeah.
[3556.20 --> 3558.60]  It's finding files and re-pulling them out.
[3558.66 --> 3562.52]  At least in this case, that's what that sounds like.
[3564.08 --> 3567.12]  Because there's no way it's syncing if he has iCloud off.
[3567.24 --> 3572.86]  And I guess, depending on how much data you write to your phone, like...
[3572.86 --> 3573.78]  You might not run over it.
[3573.78 --> 3574.02]  Yeah.
[3574.12 --> 3582.04]  We don't necessarily overwrite our phone data unless we're like, you know, regularly recording long videos, right?
[3582.12 --> 3584.88]  Like, it's not like you can fill your phone up with apps anymore.
[3585.10 --> 3585.94]  The way that we used to.
[3585.94 --> 3590.74]  The oldest photo accidentally recovered was 21st September 2022.
[3592.10 --> 3592.66]  Wow.
[3593.30 --> 3594.40]  That's been big.
[3594.40 --> 3595.58]  That's from like a year and a half ago.
[3596.84 --> 3597.60]  That's...
[3597.60 --> 3599.26]  That's rough.
[3600.04 --> 3602.82]  Man, just be glad that you have this WAN show.
[3602.94 --> 3603.36]  As an excuse.
[3603.36 --> 3606.32]  To point the current, you know, SO at.
[3606.88 --> 3609.92]  So you can be like, um, um, this is why they're there.
[3610.36 --> 3610.72]  Imagine.
[3612.80 --> 3614.32]  Oh my god.
[3614.32 --> 3618.68]  Yvonne and I hand each other our phones without a moment's thought.
[3618.68 --> 3618.74]  Yeah.
[3619.38 --> 3619.98]  I do that too.
[3620.10 --> 3624.54]  Like, we're in a very trusting, I was about to say very open relationship.
[3625.06 --> 3626.04]  We're in a...
[3626.04 --> 3627.60]  Different meaning these days.
[3627.72 --> 3628.44]  Different meaning.
[3628.52 --> 3629.72]  Look, no judgment.
[3629.88 --> 3631.16]  No judgment on my part.
[3631.28 --> 3634.60]  Whatever works for consenting adults works for consenting adults.
[3634.86 --> 3635.06]  Yeah.
[3635.06 --> 3640.80]  Um, but we're in a very, we're in a very trusting relationship and, and to us, that's no big deal.
[3641.24 --> 3648.96]  But I can't, I'm not going to say that if pictures of an ex-girlfriend were just like there in my camera roll.
[3649.40 --> 3649.84]  Yeah.
[3651.08 --> 3654.24]  Frickin' when she went to, you know, look for a recent picture that we snapped to the kid.
[3654.48 --> 3656.16]  If you, if you hadn't read this article.
[3656.40 --> 3656.66]  That would, okay.
[3656.66 --> 3658.06]  That would raise some questions.
[3658.06 --> 3664.60]  If you hadn't read this article or watched this WAN show and that happens, what do you do?
[3665.06 --> 3667.44]  What do you do?
[3667.44 --> 3667.58]  Pray?
[3667.84 --> 3671.04]  This is, this is probably going to happen to at least one person.
[3671.10 --> 3671.74]  Pray to Zeus.
[3674.50 --> 3675.80]  Strike me down now.
[3677.12 --> 3679.12]  Fix this or just do it.
[3679.22 --> 3680.88]  Or just, just get rid of it.
[3683.84 --> 3685.10]  Oh my goodness.
[3685.10 --> 3687.02]  It's like, yeah, like what, how do you explain?
[3687.16 --> 3689.76]  I, you're just at a complete loss.
[3690.04 --> 3691.48]  This picture is just here.
[3691.48 --> 3695.54]  And like people are saying that it comes to the top of your camera roll, right?
[3695.80 --> 3697.92]  Like it must show the date because, uh.
[3697.92 --> 3700.18]  The metadata probably shouldn't be changed.
[3700.32 --> 3700.46]  Yeah.
[3700.46 --> 3703.44]  There's like a, there's got to be a way to find the date that it was taken, but it would
[3703.44 --> 3705.54]  have jumped to the top of your camera roll, which like.
[3705.54 --> 3711.82]  As someone who hasn't used that app, because I don't really use iPhones, I would assume
[3711.82 --> 3714.12]  that's because it was like recently accessed or something.
[3714.56 --> 3718.50]  Like if I was the person finding this information, that would be what I would jump to, right?
[3718.52 --> 3720.48]  Like you must have looked at this recently or something.
[3721.84 --> 3724.46]  Apple single-handedly fixing the dating pool issue.
[3727.72 --> 3729.06]  I can't take credit for that.
[3729.18 --> 3730.44]  Who was that in Flowplane chat?
[3730.80 --> 3731.70]  That's pretty good.
[3731.92 --> 3732.26]  I don't know.
[3732.32 --> 3732.56]  Someone.
[3732.76 --> 3733.08]  Good job.
[3733.22 --> 3733.66]  Good job.
[3733.66 --> 3734.74]  Take that blue bubbles.
[3737.84 --> 3738.80]  Relationship ruined.
[3739.32 --> 3742.40]  You only, you got in this relationship because you didn't have an Android.
[3742.50 --> 3744.76]  You got out of this relationship because you didn't have an Android.
[3745.10 --> 3745.40]  Nice.
[3746.62 --> 3750.14]  Uh, Google gave us back the old web search, then hit it.
[3750.68 --> 3755.18]  Google has announced that it will be rolling out Gemini infused AI Google search for all users,
[3755.46 --> 3762.04]  which includes results organized using generative AI, as well as AI overviews used to summarize
[3762.04 --> 3762.56]  topics.
[3762.56 --> 3768.56]  Google has also added a web search tab that filters out everything but text-based results.
[3768.62 --> 3769.26]  Wait, hold on.
[3769.30 --> 3772.46]  Similar to how Google search used to work in the 90s and 2000s.
[3773.66 --> 3777.08]  Generative AI is sorting results?
[3779.22 --> 3779.66]  Mmm.
[3780.34 --> 3783.94]  Which includes results organized using generative AI?
[3783.94 --> 3784.36]  I don't know.
[3784.40 --> 3786.50]  Don't overthink the notes.
[3786.64 --> 3786.98]  Oh, sure.
[3787.28 --> 3788.52]  Organized using machine learning.
[3788.66 --> 3788.90]  Okay.
[3789.16 --> 3789.34]  There.
[3789.64 --> 3791.64]  Google has also added a web search tab.
[3791.72 --> 3792.02]  Oh, yep.
[3792.06 --> 3792.40]  There we go.
[3792.82 --> 3793.22]  Okay.
[3793.40 --> 3797.78]  So the web search tab is hidden under the more drop down menu, meaning that many users
[3797.78 --> 3799.88]  will likely never find it, but it kind of looks awesome.
[3799.88 --> 3804.82]  I was looking at the side-by-side in the Verge article and I was like, dang, that actually
[3804.82 --> 3805.74]  looks way better.
[3805.94 --> 3806.08]  Oh.
[3806.08 --> 3811.20]  Because just like the random carousels of products and stuff are just not there.
[3812.20 --> 3815.98]  Google also announced updates to its AI models.
[3816.52 --> 3820.20]  Gemini Nano now has multimodal capabilities, so that is more than just text.
[3820.54 --> 3823.28]  There's also a new lower latency Gemini 1.5 flash model.
[3823.72 --> 3825.12]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3825.12 --> 3828.96]  Google also presented Project Astra, which the company calls their vision for the future
[3828.96 --> 3829.76]  of AI assistance.
[3831.92 --> 3834.18]  At this point, I'm just going to wait.
[3834.96 --> 3835.26]  I'm starting.
[3835.40 --> 3835.58]  I'm not.
[3835.64 --> 3836.04]  I don't even.
[3837.14 --> 3838.12]  Cortana, Siri.
[3838.88 --> 3844.90]  At some point, one of them is going to rise above the rest, be legitimately useful, and
[3844.90 --> 3845.54]  I'll try it then.
[3845.64 --> 3847.32]  I just can't care anymore at this point.
[3847.32 --> 3852.72]  We're in the rapid development fight phase, which is fun, but if you're not that interested,
[3852.72 --> 3857.30]  yeah, I would just, I would, I don't think there's a huge point in being lightly paying
[3857.30 --> 3857.62]  attention.
[3857.74 --> 3861.90]  Yeah, if it's not your job to cover these things for a living, you don't need to try
[3861.90 --> 3866.92]  Alexa AI, which I assume probably exists in a beta state somewhere internally at Amazon.
[3867.12 --> 3868.92]  Like, I just, I don't know.
[3868.96 --> 3869.26]  Who cares?
[3869.62 --> 3869.74]  Yeah.
[3872.12 --> 3875.02]  Perceive live audio and video answering real time, blah, blah, blah.
[3875.52 --> 3877.32]  Google slips a check to the DOJ.
[3877.44 --> 3878.12]  This is kind of funny.
[3878.42 --> 3881.78]  According to a motion filed by Google this morning, the company has written the federal government
[3881.78 --> 3883.08]  a cashier's check.
[3883.54 --> 3887.76]  For triple the maximum damages claimed in the DOJ's ongoing antitrust trial.
[3888.66 --> 3889.06]  Triple!
[3889.54 --> 3892.92]  The company now claims that these monetary damages should be considered moot.
[3893.36 --> 3897.12]  The motion also argues that the case should be presented to a judge rather than a jury,
[3897.60 --> 3901.38]  both because these kinds of cases are typically decided by judges and because the case involves
[3901.38 --> 3905.92]  a complicated, intricate technology ecosystem, which the DOJ has acknowledged is highly technical,
[3906.12 --> 3910.02]  often abstract, and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors.
[3910.02 --> 3913.40]  Discussion question here is, why doesn't Google want a jury?
[3915.70 --> 3916.14]  Hmm.
[3916.66 --> 3917.08]  Wow.
[3918.16 --> 3923.82]  You know, no admission of guilt, but like, hey, here's the maximum amount of money times
[3923.82 --> 3926.50]  some multiplier that you guys might have.
[3927.00 --> 3927.44]  Whoa.
[3927.48 --> 3929.26]  I'm really glad that antitrust is heating up.
[3929.34 --> 3932.84]  I hope they go after Microsoft again for all the stuff that's going on with Windows right now.
[3933.00 --> 3933.10]  Yeah.
[3933.10 --> 3938.78]  I love that they're going after Apple who have just been given a free pass just for what being trendy.
[3939.78 --> 3939.82]  Yeah.
[3939.82 --> 3946.38]  Like, you guys understand, they are just as much a part of this capitalist hellscape that
[3946.38 --> 3950.78]  we're all participating in this, like, post, like, anything mattering other than...
[3950.78 --> 3952.68]  They're not less a part of it because they charge more.
[3952.68 --> 3954.74]  Other than shareholder returns, right?
[3954.88 --> 3963.02]  Like, the whole tech financing system is, like, broken because there's this expectation
[3963.02 --> 3967.42]  of this explosive growth in the money that you invest into these companies, and it has
[3967.42 --> 3968.50]  to come from somewhere.
[3968.64 --> 3969.20]  And guess what?
[3969.30 --> 3970.26]  Somewhere is you.
[3970.90 --> 3974.44]  Apple is absolutely a participant.
[3974.66 --> 3976.12]  They are a prime participant in this.
[3976.12 --> 3979.32]  And the fact that they were just, like, given a free pass because they have a cute commercial
[3979.32 --> 3982.88]  where a trendy guy is like, you're a PC, you wear a suit.
[3982.94 --> 3983.76]  Like, are you for real?
[3984.80 --> 3986.80]  I think that's pretty old at this point, but yeah, I hear you.
[3987.18 --> 3988.26]  What is this about?
[3989.94 --> 3990.54]  I forget.
[3990.62 --> 3993.12]  I forget exactly what antitrust thing this was.
[3993.46 --> 3994.28]  Something good, I hope.
[3994.62 --> 3994.86]  Yeah.
[3995.10 --> 3995.34]  Yeah.
[3995.56 --> 3995.76]  Fuck.
[3996.64 --> 3996.90]  Yeah.
[3997.54 --> 3998.54]  What else we got today?
[4000.12 --> 4001.70]  Did we go back to the merch messages?
[4001.98 --> 4002.58]  We owed them.
[4003.16 --> 4003.34]  Yep.
[4003.48 --> 4003.94]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4003.94 --> 4004.16]  We did.
[4004.30 --> 4004.82]  Okay, cool.
[4004.82 --> 4008.38]  You want to talk about the live service game that went offline and removed microtransactions?
[4008.70 --> 4010.28]  I know nothing about this game.
[4010.40 --> 4014.44]  What I do know is I jumped on the Steam page right before the show, and recent reviews are
[4014.44 --> 4021.02]  mostly negative, which is bad, and all reviews are mixed, and it's currently in early access.
[4021.56 --> 4022.46]  Okay, so let's...
[4022.46 --> 4022.92]  Rough start.
[4023.12 --> 4024.12]  The stage is set.
[4025.22 --> 4030.54]  Developer Airship Syndicate has delisted its MMORPG Wayfinder and has announced that it
[4030.54 --> 4034.74]  will be transitioning the game from a free-to-play live service game.
[4034.82 --> 4036.12]  Which just...
[4036.12 --> 4038.18]  That's all I need to know to dislike it heavily.
[4038.58 --> 4045.52]  To a single-player offline game with optional two- or three-player co-op and no microtransactions.
[4045.90 --> 4046.58]  What a pivot.
[4046.58 --> 4051.32]  The developer likewise claims that they will be adding content to deepen the game's RPG
[4051.32 --> 4051.86]  elements.
[4051.86 --> 4058.80]  The new roadmap includes that Airship Syndicate, the developer, plans to relaunch the game in
[4058.80 --> 4062.14]  early access for a one-time purchase of $25.
[4062.68 --> 4065.70]  Because again, it's no longer a free-to-play live service game, so they got to charge for
[4065.70 --> 4065.86]  it.
[4066.24 --> 4067.74]  And there's no microtransactions.
[4067.86 --> 4068.74]  They need to make money somehow.
[4068.82 --> 4069.28]  That makes sense.
[4069.28 --> 4074.84]  This decision seems to have upset many existing players, so that's why it's mostly negative
[4074.84 --> 4075.28]  right now.
[4075.48 --> 4082.66]  Especially those who bought the game for $150 with the exalted founders back.
[4083.02 --> 4088.24]  As they feel they invested in a very different game than the one they are now getting.
[4088.68 --> 4090.00]  That's fair.
[4090.00 --> 4096.00]  Consequently, several have posted negative reviews on Steam demanding refunds.
[4096.38 --> 4098.50]  Also fair, to be completely honest.
[4098.72 --> 4103.90]  If you're completely changing the entire game, you should probably get a refund.
[4104.42 --> 4109.36]  The root cause of this change appears to be the fact that Wayfinder's original publisher,
[4109.54 --> 4114.18]  Digital Extremes, which recently closed its publishing division and divested from the game,
[4114.60 --> 4117.12]  transferring ownership over to Airship Syndicate themselves.
[4117.12 --> 4121.96]  The development team called the change a big shift, but a necessary one to guarantee
[4121.96 --> 4123.76]  that the game is around forever.
[4124.76 --> 4126.12]  Forever is a strong word.
[4127.48 --> 4127.96]  Yeah.
[4128.18 --> 4136.66]  In better gaming news, I think it was the mission lead on Cyberpunk.
[4137.50 --> 4137.74]  Huh?
[4138.50 --> 4139.44]  Hold on.
[4140.54 --> 4144.54]  They worked on the mission design for Cyberpunk.
[4145.88 --> 4147.06]  Was this before?
[4147.12 --> 4148.10]  Before or after it was?
[4148.18 --> 4148.90]  This is super cool.
[4149.38 --> 4156.12]  They were celebrating that Cyberpunk has officially crossed over into...
[4156.80 --> 4161.80]  They were either celebrating that it is officially very positive all time, or they were celebrating
[4161.80 --> 4163.98]  that recent is overwhelmingly positive.
[4164.22 --> 4165.30]  Whoa, highlight over recent?
[4165.68 --> 4165.92]  Real quick.
[4165.98 --> 4167.16]  Or the overwhelmingly positive?
[4167.60 --> 4168.08]  99?
[4168.32 --> 4168.80]  Is that 99?
[4168.86 --> 4169.14]  95.
[4169.28 --> 4169.62]  95.
[4169.92 --> 4170.10]  Wow.
[4170.56 --> 4170.80]  Yeah.
[4170.80 --> 4171.20]  Yeah.
[4171.20 --> 4179.40]  So shout out CD Projekt Red for like royally f***ing this thing up and then man sticking
[4179.40 --> 4180.98]  with it.
[4181.40 --> 4183.48]  That is both lucky.
[4183.90 --> 4188.38]  The fact that people kept buying the game enough and they had enough cash reserves to do
[4188.38 --> 4188.50]  it.
[4188.54 --> 4190.34]  Not every developer would have even had the option.
[4190.44 --> 4192.44]  They just would have completely run out of money.
[4192.54 --> 4192.64]  Yeah.
[4192.64 --> 4196.04]  Luckily CD Projekt had a lot of other things going well for them at the same time.
[4196.10 --> 4196.24]  Yeah.
[4196.36 --> 4202.96]  So it's lucky and also whatever integrity is.
[4204.42 --> 4204.90]  Integris.
[4205.30 --> 4206.24]  High integrity.
[4206.46 --> 4207.32]  Let's go with that.
[4208.20 --> 4209.06]  So shout out.
[4209.12 --> 4209.42]  Love it.
[4209.48 --> 4212.70]  You know, let's highlight positive stories that we come across as well.
[4212.70 --> 4213.30]  That's really cool.
[4213.72 --> 4215.02]  So great job, you guys.
[4216.56 --> 4219.58]  The NG Supernova says, no, they shouldn't have released it broken initially.
[4219.58 --> 4220.42]  So no praise.
[4221.18 --> 4222.54]  Nah, that doesn't work.
[4222.68 --> 4223.34]  That doesn't work for me.
[4223.36 --> 4223.84]  No, we...
[4223.84 --> 4224.56]  This is...
[4224.56 --> 4226.18]  We hammered on them when it came out and it sucked.
[4226.38 --> 4227.54]  And now we praise them when it's good.
[4227.62 --> 4227.84]  Exactly.
[4227.84 --> 4228.82]  It's the same thing with Microsoft.
[4229.02 --> 4231.22]  We went after them when they did the studio closer thing.
[4231.34 --> 4233.78]  And then we said, hey, cool, you released a really neat controller.
[4233.94 --> 4235.04]  We can't just be...
[4235.04 --> 4235.56]  We...
[4235.56 --> 4235.98]  Look.
[4236.86 --> 4240.34]  How many companies are even left making games?
[4240.34 --> 4243.38]  We can't just hate all of them forever anytime they do anything bad.
[4243.46 --> 4244.62]  We can hate Blizzard forever.
[4245.16 --> 4245.94]  If you like.
[4246.40 --> 4246.80]  Nice.
[4247.14 --> 4247.40]  Okay?
[4247.58 --> 4247.84]  Nice.
[4248.18 --> 4251.22]  And we can be mad at Bethesda for a long time.
[4251.66 --> 4252.48]  Maybe not forever.
[4252.86 --> 4253.98]  But hopefully they fix it.
[4254.08 --> 4254.80]  Come on, guys.
[4254.80 --> 4254.96]  There you go.
[4255.20 --> 4255.42]  Please.
[4255.48 --> 4255.74]  Okay.
[4255.96 --> 4257.46]  But we can be mad at them for a while.
[4257.58 --> 4262.26]  But like, what is the point of just being angry all the time?
[4262.58 --> 4262.90]  Even...
[4262.90 --> 4263.06]  And like...
[4263.06 --> 4263.76]  Is it worth it?
[4264.14 --> 4264.38]  No.
[4264.94 --> 4265.84]  It's really not.
[4266.60 --> 4269.06]  So if someone does something bad...
[4269.06 --> 4269.50]  Even EA.
[4269.50 --> 4270.74]  Hey, someone pointed out EA is dead.
[4270.96 --> 4271.44]  Yeah, sure.
[4271.56 --> 4272.92]  But I mean, leadership might change.
[4272.96 --> 4275.18]  The people that work there are going to change constantly.
[4275.38 --> 4279.08]  Like, the company is going to be a completely different company in seven to ten years.
[4279.14 --> 4283.66]  Think about the kind of company that you don't necessarily normally think of as a company.
[4284.16 --> 4285.38]  Think about a sports team.
[4286.00 --> 4286.30]  Okay?
[4286.48 --> 4286.72]  Dude.
[4287.02 --> 4287.50]  From...
[4287.50 --> 4287.82]  From...
[4287.82 --> 4288.50]  From...
[4288.50 --> 4291.00]  From ten years ago to today.
[4291.00 --> 4294.46]  How many people on that...
[4294.46 --> 4294.88]  Yeah.
[4295.02 --> 4295.46]  They all...
[4295.46 --> 4298.10]  They all have the same brand on their shirt.
[4298.34 --> 4298.64]  Right?
[4298.92 --> 4301.84]  But how many of those people are even still there?
[4302.26 --> 4304.92]  Is the team that you're cheering for today the same team?
[4304.96 --> 4306.34]  It's the team of Theseus.
[4306.42 --> 4306.62]  Right?
[4306.78 --> 4306.94]  Yeah.
[4306.94 --> 4315.34]  And there are cases where long-term leadership does result in a culture that is just rotted
[4315.34 --> 4316.60]  out from the inside.
[4316.84 --> 4317.96]  We've seen that.
[4318.54 --> 4322.76]  But you've also got to understand that even those, like, rotten companies are going to
[4322.76 --> 4328.92]  have people that are really passionate and really dedicated and really positive and really
[4328.92 --> 4330.38]  excited and really worth supporting.
[4330.38 --> 4333.96]  And so when those projects go well and when things...
[4333.96 --> 4338.26]  Like, okay, Ubisoft is the publisher for one of my favorite series, Anno.
[4338.44 --> 4338.60]  Yeah.
[4338.96 --> 4339.72]  So what?
[4339.80 --> 4341.68]  I'm going to refuse to buy...
[4341.68 --> 4342.84]  To buy it?
[4342.92 --> 4347.38]  And we can simultaneously look at how Anno 1800 has been treated, which is amazing.
[4348.02 --> 4352.48]  They've got so many seasons of extra content and it's like meaningful extra content.
[4352.66 --> 4353.24]  Good stuff.
[4353.60 --> 4357.10]  Not just like some stupid cosmetic, you know, statue you can...
[4357.10 --> 4357.86]  And they do have that.
[4358.26 --> 4358.56]  Sure.
[4358.56 --> 4359.42]  But they've also got like...
[4359.42 --> 4361.52]  It's usually a part of a big content pack.
[4361.72 --> 4361.84]  Yeah.
[4362.04 --> 4363.58]  And people want that sometimes.
[4363.78 --> 4363.94]  Like...
[4363.94 --> 4364.82]  There's a...
[4364.82 --> 4365.18]  What are they called?
[4365.24 --> 4366.20]  Beauty builders or whatever?
[4366.32 --> 4366.44]  Yeah.
[4366.48 --> 4369.16]  Like, we can celebrate what's really good.
[4369.94 --> 4372.70]  And that doesn't mean we have to forget the things that were bad.
[4372.82 --> 4377.92]  And that when something else bad happens, we can definitely, you know, we're not stupid,
[4378.06 --> 4378.26]  right?
[4378.30 --> 4380.78]  Like, we can definitely start to notice patterns.
[4381.70 --> 4383.18]  But come on, guys.
[4383.26 --> 4384.36]  It's not...
[4384.36 --> 4387.54]  Is it good for your own mental health to be angry forever?
[4388.10 --> 4389.06]  That's another thing.
[4389.06 --> 4390.14]  I want to bring this up too.
[4390.18 --> 4390.40]  Yeah.
[4390.40 --> 4393.34]  Agent Rick Justice posted this and I've been thinking about this as well.
[4393.70 --> 4395.66]  He said, I like the Wayfinder thing.
[4395.94 --> 4399.96]  They couldn't afford to keep it an MMO when the publisher dropped out.
[4400.02 --> 4401.60]  Instead of killing the game, they made it still playable.
[4401.90 --> 4403.92]  That's my main takeaway as well.
[4404.14 --> 4406.22]  And like, I'm like, ah, yeah, they should refund those players.
[4406.30 --> 4407.38]  They may not be able to.
[4407.38 --> 4409.70]  Like, having your publisher just leave?
[4411.34 --> 4412.98]  That's gotta be really rough.
[4413.20 --> 4417.38]  And I suspect that out of their options of only bad...
[4418.84 --> 4423.58]  Out of their only bad options, they chose something that, in my opinion, is pretty good.
[4423.58 --> 4424.58]  Um...
[4425.58 --> 4426.52]  I don't know.
[4426.60 --> 4427.42]  It sucks for some people.
[4427.46 --> 4431.14]  It sucks for the people that bought that $150 pack and then now the game that they, you know,
[4431.16 --> 4433.80]  they wanted to buy, it's not gonna be that anymore, all that type of stuff.
[4433.92 --> 4434.56]  I get that.
[4434.60 --> 4435.14]  That sucks.
[4435.20 --> 4436.58]  I'm not saying it's good for those people.
[4436.94 --> 4438.70]  But their publisher's gone.
[4439.62 --> 4441.00]  They can't keep running this thing.
[4441.38 --> 4443.94]  They try to do something that is good.
[4444.04 --> 4444.78]  And I...
[4444.78 --> 4445.06]  Yeah.
[4445.18 --> 4445.56]  I don't know.
[4445.82 --> 4446.48]  It makes sense.
[4446.48 --> 4447.42]  I think it's good.
[4449.18 --> 4453.82]  And right, okay, what I was gonna say was, was Anno 1800 has been treated super well.
[4454.50 --> 4459.84]  And then from that same publisher from Ubisoft, we get stuff like Skull and Bones.
[4460.76 --> 4467.30]  And it's just like, yeah, I mean, we'll, we'll, we will sit here and talk positively about how Anno 1800 has been treated.
[4467.54 --> 4468.54]  It's a fantastic game.
[4468.72 --> 4471.38]  It's had really good advancement over its current lifespan.
[4471.66 --> 4472.68]  All this other type of stuff.
[4472.68 --> 4476.48]  And then also crap on, you know, the first quadruple A game ever.
[4476.78 --> 4479.20]  Like it's, it's, you can say both things, right?
[4480.90 --> 4484.78]  Um, New York subways are adding AI gun scanners.
[4484.92 --> 4486.82]  How the devil is this even supposed to work?
[4487.62 --> 4491.22]  New York City will be testing AI powered gun scanners in their subway system.
[4491.62 --> 4493.56]  They come from a company called Evolve.
[4493.74 --> 4496.86]  And several US states are likewise considering installing them in schools.
[4497.64 --> 4501.86]  New York's mayor has promised that the city will conduct an analysis of the scanner's accuracy.
[4502.68 --> 4509.48]  Despite the fact that the city already tested the scanners two years ago and found that the scanners alerted around 26% of the time.
[4509.48 --> 4512.04]  And its detections were 85% false.
[4512.54 --> 4515.68]  Um, with another 14% being police officers.
[4516.28 --> 4523.08]  Only 0.57% of alarms were determined to be legitimate cases of non-law enforcement persons carrying a weapon.
[4523.08 --> 4527.68]  Likely indicating that the alarm sounding when the person happened to have a weapon was essentially a coincidence.
[4528.10 --> 4528.30]  Yeah.
[4528.54 --> 4532.38]  I mean, I would believe that 0.57% of Americans just happened to have a gun on them.
[4532.44 --> 4532.94]  So like...
[4532.94 --> 4534.80]  I don't think you can in New York.
[4535.56 --> 4535.98]  Can you...
[4535.98 --> 4537.60]  Well, yeah, but just, I don't know.
[4537.60 --> 4538.30]  Just anyways?
[4538.82 --> 4538.98]  Yeah.
[4538.98 --> 4539.38]  I mean...
[4539.38 --> 4540.12]  Yeah, fair enough.
[4540.26 --> 4540.74]  It's America.
[4540.94 --> 4541.80]  It's the Second Amendment, right?
[4541.82 --> 4542.50]  What do you mean?
[4542.82 --> 4543.04]  Yeah.
[4543.22 --> 4544.68]  Like, don't do the accent.
[4544.86 --> 4545.32]  Yeah, come on.
[4545.48 --> 4547.36]  We've got our American viewers out there.
[4547.42 --> 4548.32]  You can't just...
[4548.32 --> 4549.46]  They appreciate it.
[4549.46 --> 4550.68]  You can't just be like, yee-haw!
[4550.80 --> 4551.50]  You know, like...
[4551.50 --> 4554.42]  Well, they can.
[4554.84 --> 4555.40]  Yeah, they can.
[4556.68 --> 4558.06]  But don't shoot in the air.
[4558.06 --> 4558.74]  Don't shoot in the air.
[4558.90 --> 4559.08]  Yeah.
[4559.24 --> 4560.14]  But they probably know that.
[4560.24 --> 4562.92]  Critics claim that the system could potentially cost millions.
[4563.12 --> 4568.42]  It could cause transit delays and needlessly place citizens in frequent conflict with the police.
[4568.58 --> 4569.20]  Is this like...
[4569.20 --> 4571.56]  If you get falsely flagged, like, are you just...
[4571.56 --> 4573.36]  Are you just like well-endowed?
[4573.46 --> 4575.50]  Yeah, that's when your own government, uh...
[4575.50 --> 4577.86]  You know, tells you that your penis is too big.
[4578.30 --> 4578.92]  He's packing!
[4579.20 --> 4579.98]  Falsely flagged.
[4580.00 --> 4580.50]  He's packing!
[4580.66 --> 4580.88]  Get down!
[4581.42 --> 4582.74]  Is that like super sick?
[4582.78 --> 4583.46]  Is this an honor?
[4583.60 --> 4585.54]  Is this like when you get called a cheater in a video game?
[4585.60 --> 4586.66]  Falsely flagged attack.
[4586.84 --> 4587.10]  Yeah.
[4587.30 --> 4587.90]  Um...
[4587.90 --> 4588.12]  Yeah.
[4588.82 --> 4591.92]  It's like, thank you for saying that I cheated in Counter-Strike.
[4591.92 --> 4593.56]  Because now I just feel like I'm good.
[4593.62 --> 4595.42]  It's like, thank you for saying that I had a gun.
[4597.56 --> 4601.26]  Asus is apologizing for their strange and expensive repair quotes.
[4601.80 --> 4603.12]  Um...
[4603.12 --> 4603.74]  Uh...
[4603.74 --> 4604.02]  Okay.
[4604.36 --> 4613.64]  Asus has issued an apology for causing confusion and frustration in its RMA processes following multiple reports from customers in Canada and the U.S.
[4613.64 --> 4621.38]  that the company was issuing massive bills to repair minor and superficial damage while failing to fix the actual issues that the device had been sent in for.
[4621.38 --> 4625.52]  At least one Canadian was quoted nearly 3,800 Canadian dollars.
[4625.64 --> 4626.44]  So that's about...
[4626.44 --> 4628.08]  Just under 3,000 U.S. dollars.
[4628.60 --> 4638.68]  To fix a plastic safety indent on a power connector on his RTX 4090, which is more than the card originally cost to buy, because it was allegedly not covered under Asus' standard warranty.
[4638.68 --> 4643.78]  While the issue was eventually resolved, Asus never clarified the reason for the odd quote.
[4644.72 --> 4645.68]  Asus says that...
[4645.68 --> 4660.04]  Any repairs covered under the manufacturer's limited warranty have always been and will continue to be free of charge, and that they are revising their repair pricing structure for out-of-warranty products, including a review process for abnormal pricing, to ensure consistency, transparency, and fairness.
[4660.54 --> 4667.26]  They likewise state that they will no longer automatically offer repair quotes for cosmetic imperfections that don't affect device functionality.
[4667.26 --> 4672.92]  I think that Asus has a lot of self-reflection to do.
[4673.12 --> 4682.14]  I mean, we encountered this back when we secret shopped them a while ago, where we basically had to drag them to water to get them to drink to solve our problem.
[4682.48 --> 4686.96]  And it wasn't even that they didn't ultimately solve it, or that they tried to give us the runaround.
[4687.12 --> 4689.90]  For us, it just came down to more incompetence, I think.
[4689.90 --> 4699.80]  Like, if you listen to that video and just kind of listen to our poor guys trying to explain that our issues, we just want you to explain power connectors to us.
[4703.76 --> 4713.70]  I guess all I can really say is give me a reason to not be mad anymore.
[4713.70 --> 4716.72]  You know, back to what we were talking about just now.
[4716.80 --> 4719.58]  I don't have the energy anymore.
[4719.90 --> 4720.96]  To be mad forever.
[4721.56 --> 4727.46]  So what I need to see from Asus is I need to see a clear and obvious change.
[4727.54 --> 4736.76]  I want the next Reddit thread about Asus customer support in our subreddit to be about the outstanding exchange that they had with them.
[4737.12 --> 4737.26]  Yeah, turn it around.
[4737.26 --> 4739.26]  Turn it around and like...
[4740.00 --> 4742.34]  And the storytelling arc of that was amazing.
[4743.08 --> 4744.28]  You like host videos or something?
[4744.48 --> 4745.02]  Yeah, I know, right?
[4745.10 --> 4745.82]  That was fantastic.
[4746.38 --> 4749.52]  The tie-in of the previous topic is so good.
[4749.52 --> 4750.26]  It came to me in a dream.
[4752.70 --> 4754.44]  I dream of graphics cards.
[4755.70 --> 4758.82]  And like, this is a tough one for me because I like the products.
[4759.48 --> 4761.50]  Generally speaking, they've had some duds.
[4762.08 --> 4763.90]  Pretty much every company has had some duds.
[4764.60 --> 4766.30]  I've read a lot of Asus stuff over the years.
[4766.36 --> 4767.16]  Yeah, me too.
[4767.16 --> 4769.16]  But this sucks.
[4769.84 --> 4771.16]  Because this makes it like...
[4771.16 --> 4772.16]  How do you recommend...
[4772.74 --> 4773.44]  And you know what?
[4773.76 --> 4774.22]  You know what?
[4774.34 --> 4776.60]  I'm glad this is happening, right?
[4776.66 --> 4780.98]  Because it's time that they finally got a wake-up call.
[4781.08 --> 4782.16]  Because they've always...
[4782.16 --> 4791.06]  I don't think this would have blown up the way that it has if they had largely had a lot of goodwill built up with the community.
[4791.62 --> 4792.70]  But they don't.
[4793.06 --> 4794.00]  And that's the problem.
[4794.58 --> 4799.94]  And so those years of like, yeah, they fixed it, but like the experience kind of sucked.
[4799.94 --> 4804.26]  It was pulling teeth or they gave me this weird repair quote.
[4804.38 --> 4805.64]  And I'm like, no, don't fix that.
[4805.76 --> 4818.98]  And just like these years of kind of annoying stories have built up in such a way that all it took was for a match to drop.
[4819.44 --> 4821.72]  And of course, it was going to go up in flames.
[4821.72 --> 4825.06]  And I'm glad that they're finally taking notice.
[4825.20 --> 4830.42]  And I hope that we see, you know, real prolonged change.
[4831.10 --> 4838.46]  And what I also hope is that other entities in the tech space sit up and take notice of this.
[4838.46 --> 4847.36]  Because the kinds of horror stories that you see from an Asus are the same kinds of horror stories that you see from many of the other big PC component makers.
[4847.62 --> 4850.70]  It's just that Asus is the biggest.
[4850.70 --> 4854.14]  And they happened to be the one that got called on it.
[4854.96 --> 4861.06]  So hopefully everyone else is sitting up taking notice of this and going, okay, we got to get this together.
[4861.76 --> 4862.58]  And you know what?
[4862.62 --> 4867.34]  The reality of it is these complaints about these companies are not always in good faith.
[4867.34 --> 4874.78]  I had a really bizarre exchange with someone in my DMs a while back where they were like, hey, Asus is a big sponsor of yours.
[4874.90 --> 4878.86]  And I want you to like talk about this story of how like awful my experience has been.
[4878.86 --> 4884.62]  And what happened was they are made a laptop and Asus was like, yeah, it's broken.
[4885.02 --> 4889.02]  And we're going to replace it with this one.
[4889.62 --> 4892.14]  And the guy's like, okay.
[4892.14 --> 4896.34]  And then they were like, oh, actually, we can't get that one.
[4896.84 --> 4897.82]  It's this one.
[4898.32 --> 4899.96]  And it was a better machine.
[4900.24 --> 4901.16]  But it was AMD.
[4902.42 --> 4905.40]  And Buddy was like, I want Intel.
[4905.92 --> 4907.36]  And I am outraged.
[4907.44 --> 4911.12]  And I was like, yo, this is a significantly better machine.
[4911.12 --> 4915.44]  It will give you better battery life and better performance.
[4915.70 --> 4917.82]  It even has a higher MSRP.
[4918.78 --> 4919.98]  You need to relax.
[4920.36 --> 4923.30]  And you need to just take what they're offering you because it's a good offer.
[4924.00 --> 4928.12]  And then he ended up, instead of being mad at Asus, he ended up being mad at me and Asus.
[4928.28 --> 4929.84]  And I'm like, sorry, I'm not going to lie to you.
[4929.96 --> 4930.16]  Nice.
[4930.28 --> 4930.50]  Sick.
[4930.50 --> 4939.94]  I mean, this is like a common, whenever there's like ban waves in video games, you get a lot of people riding the, I was falsely flagged.
[4939.98 --> 4946.24]  Like whenever that starts becoming a big thing, a lot of people will jump on that train trying to get some of the goodwill.
[4946.30 --> 4953.20]  But Asus's problem is that there were enough legitimate stories that they're susceptible to it.
[4953.32 --> 4953.42]  Yeah.
[4953.58 --> 4954.54]  So I guess, you know.
[4954.54 --> 4960.42]  And everyone, for a while, because this happened, everyone is going to believe anyone that claims that they were.
[4960.50 --> 4960.98]  Mistreated.
[4961.16 --> 4961.28]  Yep.
[4961.28 --> 4962.74]  Even if they're just trying to abuse.
[4963.18 --> 4963.42]  So.
[4963.78 --> 4966.32]  And that's going to cost Asus a lot more.
[4966.40 --> 4966.66]  Tons.
[4966.66 --> 4968.16]  In like bullshit claims.
[4968.26 --> 4968.42]  Yeah.
[4968.42 --> 4971.20]  Than if they had just dealt with everything properly in the first place.
[4971.22 --> 4976.14]  So now they need to, to effectively overcompensate to get out of this.
[4977.36 --> 4978.24]  So good luck.
[4979.70 --> 4989.92]  And I think, you know, in terms of our collaborations with them going forward, we, we really need to see a difference that is measurable within our community.
[4989.92 --> 4990.40]  So.
[4990.90 --> 4994.94]  Some people are pointing out that there, there might've been a specific reason why they wanted
[4994.94 --> 4998.38]  the Intel system or that some things are, could work better on the Intel system.
[4998.38 --> 4999.10]  Yeah, they didn't.
[4999.20 --> 4999.78]  I was just going to say.
[4999.78 --> 5000.00]  Trust me.
[5000.38 --> 5002.30]  That, I was getting, I was getting.
[5002.46 --> 5003.76]  He's condensing a conversation.
[5004.32 --> 5004.34]  Essays.
[5004.56 --> 5004.80]  Yeah.
[5005.06 --> 5005.66]  About this.
[5005.74 --> 5008.54]  They just wanted Intel because they were brand loyal to Intel.
[5008.54 --> 5010.82]  And I'm sorry, but I just don't have a ton of patience for that.
[5010.98 --> 5013.88]  This is, this is something that Linus would have discussed.
[5013.88 --> 5015.80]  He's condensing the conversation.
[5015.90 --> 5019.96]  I love so many of the people that I've worked with at Intel over the years.
[5020.34 --> 5023.70]  You know, I, I respect a lot of their, a lot of their processes.
[5024.16 --> 5028.72]  You know, I respect their engineering acumen and the product and, and all of those things.
[5028.72 --> 5034.40]  But with all due respect, if you are like some kind of loyal fan boy to Intel, that's,
[5034.50 --> 5035.34]  that's pretty fucked up.
[5035.52 --> 5037.46]  Like I, I just, I don't know.
[5037.52 --> 5038.20]  Just don't do that.
[5038.20 --> 5038.56]  Yeah.
[5038.56 --> 5048.94]  Uh, Marvel rivals game devs apologize for banning negative reviews, banning negative reviews.
[5049.08 --> 5049.22]  Yeah.
[5049.34 --> 5054.12]  The team behind Marvel rivals, an upcoming hero shooter has apologized for requiring creators
[5054.12 --> 5061.02]  to sign contracts, including a non disparagement clause, banning public statements detrimental
[5061.02 --> 5065.78]  to the reputation of the game in order to participate in its closed alpha play test.
[5066.94 --> 5067.42]  Hmm.
[5067.42 --> 5071.40]  In their apology, the team referred to the issue as a miscommunication and stated that
[5071.40 --> 5076.02]  they encourage creators to share honest thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms as they play.
[5076.34 --> 5080.88]  They say they are working with the creators who voice concerns to revise the contract so
[5080.88 --> 5081.66]  it is less restrictive.
[5081.88 --> 5091.00]  The issue was first flagged by, uh, by stream Brandon Larnett, AKA Siegel by streamer.
[5091.10 --> 5091.44]  Got it.
[5091.50 --> 5092.34]  That makes a lot more sense.
[5092.34 --> 5097.42]  AKA Siegel who expressed concern that, uh, many creators have signed the contract without
[5097.42 --> 5100.90]  really reading it, uh, just so that they could access the game.
[5103.02 --> 5104.76]  Non disparagement clause.
[5104.86 --> 5105.00]  Yeah.
[5105.08 --> 5110.44]  That, that sounds, uh, like a mistake, not necessarily a miscommunication.
[5110.44 --> 5117.88]  Um, I suspect this was supposed to be an NDA because it's an alpha version of the game.
[5117.94 --> 5119.50]  So they were like, Hey, don't talk about it yet.
[5119.50 --> 5125.50]  The number of times that I've seen a professional law office basically just like copy paste something.
[5125.68 --> 5126.40]  Oh dude.
[5126.48 --> 5127.62]  We talked about this on the show a while ago.
[5127.64 --> 5128.10]  Oh yeah, we did.
[5128.16 --> 5129.06]  I think I picked it last week.
[5129.16 --> 5132.66]  I have caught the, I've found the thing that they copied it off of before.
[5132.66 --> 5133.36]  Like, yeah.
[5133.46 --> 5136.14]  So I suspect it wasn't a miscommunication.
[5136.32 --> 5137.84]  There's probably a bit of Hanlon's razor here.
[5137.98 --> 5139.36]  I suspect it was a mistake.
[5139.56 --> 5143.74]  And someone is just covering their butt going like, Oh yeah, miscommunication.
[5143.76 --> 5144.42]  That's not what I meant.
[5144.68 --> 5145.00]  I mean.
[5145.14 --> 5147.46]  Which might be true because they didn't mean that because they didn't mean it to be in
[5147.46 --> 5147.64]  there.
[5147.70 --> 5148.54]  I think it was a mistake.
[5148.74 --> 5150.94]  Um, glad they're fixing it.
[5151.02 --> 5152.04]  Glad they're apologizing.
[5152.16 --> 5157.02]  I think it's, I think it's frustrating, you know, as an end user or as an observer to see
[5157.02 --> 5160.20]  something like this and go like, well, can't you guys just own it?
[5160.20 --> 5162.32]  Can't you just tell us what actually went wrong?
[5162.38 --> 5170.08]  But the reality of it is most organizations for legal or privacy or HR reasons can't necessarily
[5170.08 --> 5174.78]  just say, yeah, it was, it was Jeffrey from legal who screwed it up.
[5174.78 --> 5176.60]  Like they actually can't do that.
[5176.90 --> 5181.34]  Um, literally be legally unable to, um, people pointed out that apparently you were able to
[5181.34 --> 5181.90]  stream it.
[5181.90 --> 5184.00]  So it's not like it should have been covered by NDA.
[5184.16 --> 5184.36]  Okay.
[5184.46 --> 5184.88]  Interesting.
[5185.44 --> 5190.18]  Um, another person deep blue said, I mean, it's an alpha.
[5190.20 --> 5195.46]  You may not want people to be overly critical of it since it is clearly still in development.
[5195.88 --> 5198.00]  Um, I don't think that's fair.
[5198.18 --> 5201.72]  I still suspect this is a case of the right hand, not talking to the left hand.
[5202.04 --> 5202.20]  Yeah.
[5202.42 --> 5210.62]  Um, and I, I, I suspect that if it wasn't for human pride and HR rules and legal rules, probably
[5210.62 --> 5214.96]  we'd get a more, uh, a more straightforward answer, but this is probably the best we're
[5214.96 --> 5215.36]  going to get.
[5215.36 --> 5215.80]  Yeah.
[5215.80 --> 5216.12]  Yeah.
[5216.26 --> 5219.80]  I think, I think if you're doing something like that and you're worried about criticism
[5219.80 --> 5225.60]  because it is a true alpha, while a lot of games will like sort of pretend to be an alpha
[5225.60 --> 5225.98]  or beta.
[5226.64 --> 5230.78]  Um, I think that's just something that you, you push the creators to communicate.
[5230.90 --> 5234.76]  You might even make it so that a requirement of the contract is to communicate that this
[5234.76 --> 5238.94]  is like still in development, alpha, not final, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5239.62 --> 5240.72]  Um, all right.
[5240.78 --> 5241.90]  Is it time for after dark?
[5242.86 --> 5243.20]  Can be.
[5244.24 --> 5245.94]  I'm missing my own party right now.
[5246.04 --> 5246.94]  Anything is possible.
[5247.48 --> 5248.96]  Oh, he can do it remotely now.
[5249.06 --> 5249.36]  Sick.
[5249.82 --> 5250.06]  Yeah.
[5250.20 --> 5250.68]  All right, Dan.
[5250.68 --> 5251.46]  He yelled at me last time.
[5251.56 --> 5251.88]  Yeah.
[5252.60 --> 5252.94]  Yeah.
[5252.94 --> 5254.72]  Everybody should be lazy.
[5255.32 --> 5256.36]  Automation is great.
[5257.00 --> 5258.08]  Uh, let's see.
[5258.28 --> 5258.72]  Sup DLL.
[5258.94 --> 5265.10]  I would love to know if you guys have been following the rather impressive AMD Strix Halo
[5265.10 --> 5270.60]  Point APU benchmarks and specs leaks and whether it will be bad news for Intel's Battle Mage.
[5271.22 --> 5272.98]  I am hoping for the best.
[5272.98 --> 5276.84]  It looks like it's going to be flipping awesome and very exciting.
[5276.84 --> 5284.04]  I, uh, I, I try not to take leaks with any less than about a wheelbarrow full of salt.
[5284.46 --> 5291.54]  So maybe, um, I'll, I'll evaluate it once I've got my hands on it, but if it's anywhere
[5291.54 --> 5294.92]  near as good as the leaks look, yeah, Intel's got to figure some stuff out.
[5295.78 --> 5297.50]  Dan, um, I pushed the wrong button.
[5297.62 --> 5298.42]  I pushed the wrong button.
[5298.62 --> 5299.20]  Oh, again.
[5299.30 --> 5299.88]  What's this?
[5300.64 --> 5301.90]  That's, that's our sponsors, Luke.
[5302.58 --> 5303.48]  I'm sorry.
[5303.98 --> 5304.86]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[5304.86 --> 5307.78]  I even double checked and then I just pushed it anyway.
[5307.92 --> 5309.06]  He got me on that one.
[5310.36 --> 5310.90]  Darn it.
[5311.60 --> 5312.38]  What's this?
[5313.16 --> 5314.30]  What is a computer?
[5315.80 --> 5316.82]  What's a computer?
[5317.04 --> 5318.32]  Stop all the downloading.
[5319.94 --> 5322.02]  I really hope people understand the wrong.
[5322.02 --> 5322.84]  G.I. Joe.
[5325.34 --> 5327.42]  That entire video lives in my brain.
[5327.78 --> 5328.58]  I'm a computer.
[5329.28 --> 5330.14]  Mom, you're on your video.
[5330.26 --> 5331.14]  Good job, I'm a computer.
[5331.38 --> 5331.88]  I'm glad.
[5331.88 --> 5335.66]  I'm glad you understand that.
[5335.92 --> 5337.26]  Oh, it's, I, yeah.
[5337.68 --> 5338.04]  Um.
[5338.80 --> 5339.66]  Pork chop sandwiches!
[5340.26 --> 5342.86]  Was a, uh, very often said thing in my house.
[5343.42 --> 5343.88]  Um.
[5344.50 --> 5344.92]  Anyways.
[5345.24 --> 5347.04]  We just confused a lot of people.
[5349.78 --> 5351.32]  I miss proto-internet.
[5351.72 --> 5352.30]  Yeah, me too.
[5353.78 --> 5354.22]  Uh.
[5354.74 --> 5355.30]  Next one?
[5356.26 --> 5356.68]  Yeah, sure.
[5356.78 --> 5358.06]  If you, if you finish that one off, I'm sorry.
[5358.16 --> 5359.38]  I ruined that whole thing.
[5359.38 --> 5360.66]  I don't know, I haven't followed it.
[5360.66 --> 5362.72]  Spec Leaks, Battle Mage, yeah, we'll find out soon.
[5362.88 --> 5363.02]  Yeah.
[5363.16 --> 5365.20]  Hello, DLL, I'm currently in flight school.
[5365.32 --> 5370.44]  My dad is convinced that I will be the last generation of, uh, commercial pilots.
[5370.66 --> 5375.44]  With the maturity of autopilot and planes, how do you feel about no crew flights?
[5375.86 --> 5376.88]  Uh, also party shot.
[5377.12 --> 5378.36]  Party shirt restock.
[5378.36 --> 5381.96]  We are definitely still gonna need crews, but it might be more like bouncers.
[5383.36 --> 5386.44]  Did you see that fight that broke out on a plane, on a plane recently?
[5386.64 --> 5387.84]  No, but I mean, there's been tons.
[5388.08 --> 5388.28]  Yeah.
[5388.44 --> 5389.62]  Did they tape them to the chair again?
[5389.68 --> 5391.22]  That's been a standard maneuver lately.
[5391.36 --> 5392.34]  I don't know, but that's hilarious.
[5392.54 --> 5394.48]  I haven't actually seen people being taped to the chair.
[5394.48 --> 5397.08]  Yeah, the people that freak out, if they won't settle down, they just like tape them
[5397.08 --> 5397.54]  to the chair.
[5398.28 --> 5399.96]  And then people just don't sit next to them.
[5400.00 --> 5402.50]  And it's like, okay, we'll wait till we land and then someone can deal with you.
[5402.90 --> 5403.44]  That's awesome.
[5403.66 --> 5403.82]  Yeah.
[5403.82 --> 5405.36]  Did they put the new Atlas robots on there?
[5405.74 --> 5406.14]  Pull.
[5406.32 --> 5406.54]  Pull.
[5406.54 --> 5410.12]  Just like fold them up in the like overhead baggage things.
[5410.14 --> 5412.54]  I thought you meant the Atlas robots could just fold up the people.
[5414.80 --> 5416.24]  You have become cube.
[5416.52 --> 5418.18]  Both can be true.
[5418.30 --> 5418.50]  Yeah.
[5418.96 --> 5419.92]  Um, I don't know.
[5419.92 --> 5425.18]  I suspect people are gonna want human supervision for a considerable amount of time.
[5425.56 --> 5428.56]  Um, but probably not forever.
[5429.40 --> 5429.98]  So I don't know.
[5430.08 --> 5432.98]  I mean, the nice thing is that the planes like throw people out anyway now.
[5433.82 --> 5436.14]  All right.
[5436.14 --> 5437.52]  The plane is its own bouncer.
[5438.50 --> 5441.34]  I mean, that was just that one plane that couldn't stay straight.
[5442.50 --> 5443.64]  Because it was Boeing.
[5444.02 --> 5444.36]  Oh!
[5445.38 --> 5446.34]  That's pretty good.
[5446.40 --> 5446.72]  Sorry.
[5446.96 --> 5447.70]  I like that one.
[5448.12 --> 5449.22]  Hey, hello.
[5449.22 --> 5454.18]  Well, I heard Linus talk about his theory about Nvidia making a Shield 2 in a past video.
[5454.48 --> 5458.90]  Now that Nintendo has confirmed that a Switch 2 is in the works, do you think it'll happen?
[5459.02 --> 5459.88]  I still think so.
[5459.94 --> 5460.90]  I still hope so.
[5461.26 --> 5465.08]  I think Nvidia just wants Nintendo to pay for the development of the chip.
[5465.08 --> 5467.96]  And then they're just gonna release a Shield Pro 2.
[5468.44 --> 5469.62]  That's what I'm kind of counting on.
[5469.66 --> 5471.72]  Because that thing is bloody old at this point.
[5471.82 --> 5473.24]  And I want better AI upscaling.
[5473.66 --> 5474.34]  It really is.
[5475.18 --> 5475.52]  Luke.
[5475.98 --> 5480.94]  You often promote helping open source projects as a way to build your resume as a software developer.
[5481.26 --> 5484.68]  Do you have any FOSS projects that you want to draw more attention towards?
[5484.68 --> 5487.48]  Uh, no.
[5489.38 --> 5490.74]  Good day, LLD.
[5491.26 --> 5491.82]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5492.42 --> 5493.36]  No, go away.
[5493.54 --> 5493.68]  Next.
[5493.96 --> 5494.40]  I'll explain.
[5494.68 --> 5497.38]  There's a video that's actually quite good from Theo.
[5497.46 --> 5500.88]  If you look up Theo T3 on YouTube, there's Don't Contribute to Open Source.
[5501.10 --> 5502.40]  It's actually a very good video.
[5502.82 --> 5505.84]  The point isn't to not contribute to open source.
[5505.84 --> 5508.84]  The point is if you are...
[5509.80 --> 5513.84]  The problem with telling people to contribute to open source in order to...
[5514.68 --> 5517.94]  Make your, like, GitHub more attractive for potential recruiters.
[5518.08 --> 5520.58]  Or when you're trying to put it on your resume and stuff like that.
[5520.76 --> 5523.40]  The problem with that is that...
[5523.40 --> 5528.02]  That often promotes very poor behavior.
[5528.72 --> 5533.04]  Where people are spamming commits that are often not helpful.
[5533.04 --> 5535.60]  And sometimes actually just bad.
[5536.14 --> 5539.76]  And wasting the time of the maintainers of said projects.
[5540.58 --> 5544.42]  And it's become, like, actually an issue.
[5544.68 --> 5546.56]  So, if you...
[5546.56 --> 5551.38]  Like, it looks very good on you.
[5551.86 --> 5557.68]  If you can make meaningful, good, useful contributions to open source projects.
[5557.82 --> 5564.16]  But it can be a red flag if a recruiter or a person doing hiring, stuff like that.
[5565.44 --> 5571.16]  If they look at your GitHub and then see a lot of garbage things.
[5571.16 --> 5573.04]  So, what Luke is trying to say is...
[5573.62 --> 5575.10]  Don't let him suggest the project.
[5575.50 --> 5576.80]  Find something you're passionate about.
[5576.80 --> 5577.08]  Yes.
[5577.24 --> 5578.16]  And really make...
[5578.16 --> 5579.38]  Have a meaningful impact on it.
[5579.52 --> 5579.64]  Yeah.
[5579.64 --> 5580.60]  That's going to look way better.
[5580.74 --> 5584.38]  If you can make actually good commits to something that you're interested in.
[5584.40 --> 5586.24]  So, you're actually going to spend time working on it.
[5586.32 --> 5588.20]  If you're not wasting the time of maintainers.
[5588.26 --> 5590.06]  So, you're actually, like, giving them good stuff.
[5590.16 --> 5591.78]  That will reflect very well.
[5592.14 --> 5593.28]  But just being like...
[5593.28 --> 5596.12]  Hey, suggest something to me so that I can get hired.
[5597.08 --> 5599.16]  Actually, like, just isn't really going to work.
[5599.32 --> 5601.20]  So, find something that brings meaning to you.
[5602.28 --> 5604.20]  There's a lot of stuff out there.
[5604.24 --> 5604.94]  I'm sure you can do it.
[5605.40 --> 5606.10]  Hey, WAN DLL.
[5606.28 --> 5607.26]  More specifically, Luke.
[5607.48 --> 5609.54]  What do you tell your barber when you get your haircut?
[5609.82 --> 5611.90]  I no longer go to my lifelong hairdresser.
[5612.04 --> 5613.96]  So, I have no clue what to tell a proper barber.
[5614.64 --> 5617.98]  I Google Captain America Winter Soldier.
[5617.98 --> 5624.26]  And I find a frame of Chris Evans that shows his hair off decently well.
[5624.66 --> 5627.18]  I mean, would you consider a frame that shows off his butt?
[5627.32 --> 5628.64]  Because that's a good frame, too.
[5628.88 --> 5629.18]  Probably.
[5629.44 --> 5632.40]  If they could make your butt look like that, they'd be a pretty good barber.
[5633.56 --> 5634.94]  Yeah, that's true.
[5635.12 --> 5635.72]  Got that cake.
[5635.92 --> 5637.10]  But yeah, I do that.
[5637.48 --> 5641.28]  I would look up myself, I guess.
[5641.28 --> 5649.06]  But I find finding that actually to be a lot more difficult than just looking up Winter Soldier Chris Evans.
[5649.34 --> 5650.94]  So, yeah, that's what I showed them.
[5651.50 --> 5653.08]  Go to a salon and make them pick.
[5653.88 --> 5655.22]  Yeah, I did that once.
[5655.38 --> 5656.44]  Apparently, people hate that.
[5656.52 --> 5657.46]  That was really bad.
[5657.88 --> 5662.96]  Yeah, apparently, like, waiters and waitresses, like, friggin' hate when you, like, surprise me.
[5664.16 --> 5665.24]  Someone told me that.
[5666.42 --> 5667.58]  It depends on the person, I think.
[5667.66 --> 5668.64]  I do it anyways sometimes.
[5668.64 --> 5670.64]  Hey, guys.
[5670.78 --> 5676.00]  My 1,000-person company recently went bankrupt and was bought by a giant conglomerate.
[5676.24 --> 5678.42]  And I'm worried so much is going to change.
[5678.48 --> 5679.32]  But I love my job.
[5679.52 --> 5680.68]  How would you deal with this?
[5684.88 --> 5685.98]  God, I don't even know.
[5686.26 --> 5689.88]  I'm trying to imagine, like, okay, my company went bankrupt and was bought.
[5690.00 --> 5691.32]  And I'm worried so much it's going to change.
[5691.36 --> 5692.04]  But I love my job.
[5692.10 --> 5692.66]  I mean, that's me.
[5692.74 --> 5695.18]  Except we are not bankrupt and have not been purchased.
[5697.08 --> 5698.24]  How would I deal with this?
[5698.24 --> 5700.94]  I'd probably cry a little and then cry a lot.
[5702.40 --> 5703.70]  Or pay a lot of attention.
[5704.32 --> 5705.70]  Yeah, ask a lot of questions.
[5705.92 --> 5706.12]  Yeah.
[5708.74 --> 5709.52]  Be visible.
[5710.52 --> 5712.30]  I would say that's critical.
[5713.42 --> 5715.24]  Be visible to new management.
[5716.02 --> 5722.02]  It doesn't have to be, like, you know, for doing the best thing.
[5722.52 --> 5724.62]  Definitely don't want it to be for doing the worst thing.
[5724.80 --> 5726.24]  Make sure they know your name, though.
[5727.32 --> 5730.96]  That might give you a shot at being treated like a human instead of a number.
[5731.14 --> 5732.04]  Not save you at all.
[5732.06 --> 5732.98]  It might make no difference.
[5733.04 --> 5733.94]  It's a good idea, though.
[5734.86 --> 5735.94]  But try to...
[5735.94 --> 5736.10]  Yeah.
[5736.22 --> 5740.32]  I would pay a lot of attention and prep for the worst.
[5740.32 --> 5749.00]  But also, you know, these people might not be bad people to have connections with, even if things go south.
[5749.10 --> 5751.88]  Because they're still working in the industry that you're in.
[5752.32 --> 5756.00]  So, you know, don't just, like, be a jerk at work.
[5756.82 --> 5758.10]  Try to do a good job.
[5758.78 --> 5760.10]  Hopefully, things work out.
[5760.20 --> 5761.78]  Hopefully, you like the new workplace.
[5762.14 --> 5763.48]  And hopefully, you get kept on.
[5763.68 --> 5768.32]  But if any of those things aren't true, you can still leave with a good, clean bridge behind you.
[5768.72 --> 5773.02]  And you can try to use this time a little bit to prepare to potentially leave if you do need to.
[5773.02 --> 5774.34]  So, yeah.
[5774.34 --> 5778.34]  Linus, have you ever dealt with the arrival fallacy?
[5778.58 --> 5781.42]  What is it like achieving the level of success that you have?
[5781.58 --> 5782.92]  How does it feel after?
[5784.26 --> 5785.58]  I had to look this up.
[5787.72 --> 5788.26]  Hold on.
[5788.32 --> 5791.70]  I need to do another one really quick before I lose it.
[5791.74 --> 5793.12]  I accidentally archived it.
[5793.24 --> 5794.78]  And I feel really bad.
[5794.84 --> 5796.42]  I don't think I can find it anymore.
[5797.16 --> 5797.50]  Oh, no.
[5797.50 --> 5797.90]  Oh, yeah.
[5797.96 --> 5798.32]  No, no, no.
[5798.38 --> 5799.34]  It ended up in the right place.
[5799.38 --> 5799.50]  Okay.
[5799.62 --> 5800.68]  So, I had to look this up.
[5800.68 --> 5807.74]  So, it refers to the belief that attaining a particular goal will lead to long-term happiness.
[5808.04 --> 5811.92]  So, the most important thing to understand is this belief is not grounded in reality.
[5812.30 --> 5819.68]  I don't think I've experienced the arrival fallacy because I don't think I ever believed that I had a...
[5819.68 --> 5836.40]  I don't think I ever had a belief that achieving some kind of goal with, like, Linus Media Group or, you know, having kids or, like, in my relationship, I don't think I ever believed that that would result in long-term happiness.
[5836.40 --> 5854.20]  I think that, if anything, I had a completely separate issue where I was so focused on survival that I wasn't really giving any thought to what success looked like and what an endgame looked like.
[5855.30 --> 5858.06]  I mean, I, you know, strategized and planned, right?
[5858.06 --> 5869.04]  You know, we talked about Yvonne's If I Die folder, you know, earlier in the show, like, I would talk about, like, here's what I would want to happen, like, if I was out of the picture for some reason to the company and stuff like that.
[5869.10 --> 5872.62]  But, like, I didn't really, like, internalize it.
[5872.62 --> 5894.12]  And, you know, for me, reaching the level of success that I did when I did that, I've been thinking of retiring stream, where I spoke from the heart about how I felt about, you know, being at a point in my life where, realistically, I've done everything I set out to do, whether I had really, you know, written that down as a plan or not.
[5894.12 --> 5903.06]  Reaching that point where, you know, nothing really mattered anymore.
[5903.28 --> 5910.98]  Like, if I died that day, my kids would go to school, you know, they'd have all their university paid for.
[5911.20 --> 5916.54]  And, like, I think the company probably could have survived at that point.
[5916.62 --> 5920.68]  Like, it would have been kind of tough going for a little bit, but they probably could have figured it out.
[5922.62 --> 5923.58]  I don't know, empty?
[5924.78 --> 5925.92]  Like, it was challenging.
[5926.08 --> 5928.26]  I had to figure out how to find a purpose again.
[5928.36 --> 5930.46]  And I talked about that at the end of the stream.
[5930.68 --> 5943.20]  Just, you know, figuring out how to do something because you want to and figuring out how to want to, doing it on your own terms rather than just because you have to.
[5943.32 --> 5950.56]  Because switching over from just, like, fight or flight survival mode to I can survive now.
[5951.34 --> 5952.60]  I've achieved the goal.
[5952.60 --> 5954.42]  I have a big problem with that, personally.
[5954.42 --> 5960.36]  If I don't have a fight, I tend to mentally fall really fast.
[5960.44 --> 5962.98]  I, like, need something to kind of rage against to a certain degree.
[5962.98 --> 5970.80]  But something that I've tried to do is have a next plan.
[5971.64 --> 5978.84]  Like, if you have a goal, be like, okay, achieving this goal will unlock my ability to progress into this next thing.
[5978.84 --> 5981.26]  If you can do that, that can be pretty good.
[5981.76 --> 5984.18]  Like, for me, a lot of stuff recently has been fitness.
[5984.18 --> 5991.86]  So it's like, okay, if I get to this certain level, the certain benchmark that I'm aiming for, that will allow me to focus on this other more different thing.
[5991.86 --> 6001.04]  And just try to always have the next thing kind of planned out so the arrival isn't really so much of a, you can maybe celebrate it, but it's a short celebration that it's back to work.
[6002.38 --> 6002.50]  Yeah.
[6002.50 --> 6005.50]  All right.
[6005.70 --> 6006.64]  Loo me, go to bed.
[6006.70 --> 6007.12]  It's late.
[6008.90 --> 6009.58]  And float plane chat.
[6010.40 --> 6012.50]  It's over, it's after four in the morning there.
[6013.56 --> 6016.20]  Hello, DLL.ing.
[6016.64 --> 6020.04]  My dad calls himself a tech enthusiast, but doesn't watch the WAN show.
[6020.22 --> 6023.50]  What suggestions do y'all have to get him plopped on the couch next to me?
[6023.82 --> 6025.36]  Appreciate all y'all do.
[6025.80 --> 6026.14]  I don't know.
[6026.24 --> 6027.72]  The Canucks are having a heck of a playoff run.
[6027.90 --> 6028.42]  Watch some hockey.
[6029.74 --> 6029.96]  Yeah.
[6030.24 --> 6031.00]  You don't have to.
[6031.00 --> 6037.78]  I mean, what tech entertainment show would you, like, be plopped on the couch for a long time, like, watching?
[6038.28 --> 6039.82]  Watch some, I don't know, like.
[6045.10 --> 6045.68]  I don't know.
[6045.68 --> 6047.70]  Does he like Marquez's stuff?
[6049.04 --> 6049.84]  That kind of tech?
[6050.64 --> 6051.00]  Waveform.
[6051.20 --> 6052.62]  I don't like, yeah, it's a podcast.
[6053.16 --> 6055.08]  Are we trying to suggest tech entertainment shows?
[6055.12 --> 6055.68]  I think so.
[6057.16 --> 6057.94]  Silicon Valley.
[6058.10 --> 6059.24]  Yeah, watch Silicon Valley.
[6059.60 --> 6060.46]  Watch WAN show.
[6060.50 --> 6061.62]  Heck yeah, watch Silicon Valley.
[6061.86 --> 6062.94]  Watch Technology Connections.
[6063.04 --> 6063.96]  Sure, go watch that stuff.
[6064.12 --> 6065.28]  Technology Connections is sick.
[6065.36 --> 6065.50]  Yeah.
[6065.60 --> 6066.28]  All right, there, good.
[6066.32 --> 6066.88]  We got a good one.
[6067.18 --> 6067.74]  Oh, crap.
[6069.96 --> 6070.28]  Oh.
[6070.76 --> 6071.30]  Oh, no.
[6072.20 --> 6074.12]  Sorry, I moved it somewhere.
[6074.18 --> 6074.72]  I'm just going to read it.
[6074.72 --> 6077.40]  I know Linus loves talking about Canadian housing problems.
[6077.50 --> 6082.52]  Have you seen the latest headlines about the CRA coming after tenants for taxes of foreign landlords?
[6082.52 --> 6091.42]  It just sounds like yet another fake solution.
[6091.42 --> 6100.92]  I think that unless they're spectacularly stupid, you know, our policymakers absolutely understand what the underlying issues are.
[6100.92 --> 6107.72]  And they've shown clearly that they have no intention whatsoever of fixing them.
[6108.78 --> 6113.12]  Institutional investment in residential housing needs to stop.
[6113.68 --> 6113.82]  Yeah.
[6113.82 --> 6119.28]  If they want to collect more taxes, they need to collect taxes from people who own many properties.
[6119.28 --> 6130.26]  Like, that's the way that you can both enact a wealth tax, which is something that they obviously have a great interest in if you've been following Canadian politics.
[6130.26 --> 6133.26]  That's a way that you can enact a wealth tax.
[6133.26 --> 6138.24]  While also easing the pressure on people who need access to housing.
[6139.16 --> 6141.08]  And you can hit two birds with one stone.
[6141.16 --> 6149.08]  But the reason that nobody wants to do it is because the policymakers are landowners and they benefit from always rising land costs.
[6149.08 --> 6160.56]  So instead they are enacting, you know, oh, here, why don't we take taxpayer dollars that we take from everyone and why don't we use it to as like to give out as a rent subsidy?
[6160.56 --> 6163.36]  And on the surface of it, that sounds like a good idea.
[6163.36 --> 6170.68]  It's almost like a universal basic income top up kind of thing for for the for the less fortunate for lower earners.
[6170.82 --> 6175.40]  But in practice, no, what they're actually doing is they're giving it to landowners.
[6175.52 --> 6178.96]  They're giving it directly to landowners themselves.
[6179.38 --> 6180.40]  Which is themselves.
[6181.12 --> 6183.00]  So it's pretty it's pretty f***ed up.
[6184.62 --> 6185.76]  So, no, I don't know.
[6185.86 --> 6187.84]  I saw a headline about that.
[6187.90 --> 6190.88]  I hadn't looked into it in any detail, but the whole thing is just it's f***ed.
[6192.88 --> 6194.72]  And if I was in charge, we'd do it differently.
[6194.72 --> 6197.68]  But I'm not and I'm not going to be.
[6200.00 --> 6202.10]  But what I am going to be is gaming.
[6203.10 --> 6204.52]  Yeah, we'll see you again next week.
[6204.62 --> 6205.34]  Same bad time.
[6205.44 --> 6205.98]  Same bad channel.
[6206.06 --> 6208.38]  I got a land party to get to time for some tape to tape.
[6209.34 --> 6209.70]  Bye.
[6209.70 --> 6210.70]  Bye.
