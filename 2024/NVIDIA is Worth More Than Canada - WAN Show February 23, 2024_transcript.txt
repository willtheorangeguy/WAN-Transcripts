[0.00 --> 3.30]  Welcome to the WAD show. We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[3.64 --> 8.30]  Nvidia hit a valuation of two trillion dollars.
[8.70 --> 11.94]  Yes, yes, with a pinky. Trillion.
[12.56 --> 17.06]  Also, Reddit's licensing deal with Google has been...
[17.06 --> 20.96]  This was leaked, right? No, they confirmed the leak.
[21.34 --> 24.32]  Also, Reddit is going public. What else we got today?
[24.86 --> 27.08]  PlayStation 2 VR is coming to PC?
[28.08 --> 28.62]  Five.
[28.62 --> 30.58]  Five. Well, okay.
[31.36 --> 32.58]  PlayStation VR 2.
[32.82 --> 34.16]  He's not feeling well today.
[34.16 --> 35.24]  This could be a rough show.
[35.90 --> 38.24]  And I have no excuse. What else we got?
[39.34 --> 40.22]  Oh, boy.
[41.60 --> 44.26]  And the CEO says, don't buy Helldivers 2.
[45.40 --> 47.30]  Really? You picked that.
[47.68 --> 48.30]  I don't know.
[48.68 --> 49.82]  The CEO of what?
[50.48 --> 51.88]  It's not... It doesn't say.
[51.88 --> 56.64]  I'm pretty sure the CEO of Arrowhead, which is the company that made Helldivers 2.
[56.64 --> 59.08]  Cool. That's the context they needed. Let's roll that intro.
[63.60 --> 64.40]  Oh, boy.
[66.40 --> 66.92]  Whoa.
[66.92 --> 67.86]  Who are you?
[79.66 --> 83.94]  This disaster is brought to you by AG1, Vessi, and The Ridge.
[83.94 --> 85.94]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic?
[86.06 --> 90.88]  And that is NVIDIA's market cap go stonks.
[91.82 --> 94.94]  What the actual f*** am I looking at here?
[95.06 --> 97.48]  This is parabolic.
[97.48 --> 104.42]  Surely, there must be a limit to this somewhere, but we've yet to see it.
[104.52 --> 105.90]  Absolutely incredible.
[106.06 --> 113.72]  So what we're looking at here is Crypto Boom the first, Crypto Boom the second, and AI...
[113.72 --> 115.98]  Okay, what's a word that's bigger than boom?
[116.38 --> 116.98]  Hyper Boom?
[117.52 --> 118.78]  I like Hyper Boom.
[118.78 --> 121.12]  Yeah, I don't know...
[121.12 --> 121.32]  Turbo Boom.
[121.46 --> 122.30]  Turbo Boom.
[123.14 --> 124.18]  Mondo Boom.
[124.42 --> 125.22]  Omega Boom.
[125.40 --> 125.80]  It's...
[125.80 --> 129.68]  I don't mind Omega Boom, but it would have to be the last one, and I really don't think
[129.68 --> 134.94]  this is the last we're seeing of interesting uses for NVIDIA's GPUs that are, spoiler,
[135.34 --> 136.30]  not gaming.
[137.14 --> 142.66]  NVIDIA briefly hit a $2 trillion market cap this morning, becoming the third company to
[142.66 --> 144.84]  do so after Apple and Microsoft.
[144.84 --> 150.96]  However, Axios has argued that NVIDIA's current arc is likely to plateau, given that most of
[150.96 --> 157.00]  its biggest customers, like Microsoft and Google, have reported weak earnings numbers
[157.00 --> 162.06]  recently, in part because their expensive AI features largely aren't making money yet.
[162.54 --> 166.92]  NVIDIA might also face increased competition within the AI chip market, as companies like
[166.92 --> 172.14]  Microsoft continue developing their own chips in an effort to move away from their dependence
[172.14 --> 178.62]  on NVIDIA, who charges, as we gamers already knew and could have warned them about, a lot
[178.62 --> 179.84]  for their technology.
[180.06 --> 180.38]  Oh, yeah.
[180.56 --> 187.12]  In its most recent annual report, NVIDIA listed its top competitors as Huawei, AMD, Amazon,
[187.54 --> 189.48]  Microsoft, and Broadcom.
[190.06 --> 193.28]  NVIDIA has also launched a beta for the NVIDIA app.
[193.36 --> 195.14]  Okay, well, this is a completely separate topic.
[195.30 --> 196.28]  Very, very different.
[196.28 --> 204.56]  Anyway, the point is, we're being asked in our discussion question, how overhyped is
[204.56 --> 205.18]  it really?
[205.72 --> 210.78]  And I would like to preface our response with, we are not analysts.
[211.12 --> 211.20]  No.
[211.48 --> 211.74]  Yep.
[211.86 --> 212.58]  This is not financial advice.
[212.58 --> 215.92]  We're not, there's no anal in either of us.
[216.08 --> 216.30]  Nope.
[217.28 --> 217.80]  Not right now.
[217.80 --> 227.26]  Oh, anyway, the point is that we're not analysts, and we, and this is not financial advice.
[227.82 --> 232.00]  That should set the tone for how seriously you should be taking any of what I'm about to
[232.00 --> 232.24]  say.
[232.46 --> 232.66]  Yeah.
[232.78 --> 243.58]  Um, but to be, to be truthful with you, I think that NVIDIA does have competition coming.
[243.58 --> 248.88]  Uh, Jim Keller actually just weighed in on Sam Altman's whole thing where he needs like
[248.88 --> 252.64]  seven trillion dollars to build AI chips or something like that, and he's basically like,
[252.76 --> 255.04]  I'll do it in less.
[255.54 --> 255.72]  Oh.
[255.96 --> 256.24]  Yeah.
[256.72 --> 256.94]  Dang.
[256.94 --> 258.06]  Like that Jim Keller.
[258.28 --> 258.48]  Yeah.
[258.62 --> 261.66]  Like, like K8 AMD Jim Keller.
[262.22 --> 267.90]  And, um, shoot, what was the, uh, uh, what, man, I'm trying to think.
[267.90 --> 269.94]  Oh, yeah, also Zen Jim Keller.
[270.16 --> 272.70]  Like, like that Jim Keller, like chip architect Jim Keller.
[272.70 --> 279.68]  Um, so with that said, I mean, it's clear that competition is coming for them.
[279.76 --> 286.32]  It's clear that additional fab capacity is coming in the future.
[286.52 --> 292.32]  Uh, Intel has been talking a lot about their intention to, I mean, this is, this is great.
[292.38 --> 296.60]  This actually isn't in the doc this week, but Pat Gelsinger said, we'd love to build
[296.60 --> 297.76]  chips for AMD.
[297.76 --> 303.58]  He actually like finally said the thing that I was talking about over the last little bit
[303.58 --> 308.96]  where I've been like, Hey, this Intel, we're going to be a fab thing is something that I
[308.96 --> 310.22]  think has been overlooked.
[310.32 --> 311.38]  Not financial advice.
[311.72 --> 316.28]  Um, also Intel insiders are apparently buying up a bunch of stock right now.
[316.82 --> 318.30]  Not financial advice.
[318.30 --> 323.28]  Uh, but, uh, but what appears is going to be happening.
[323.40 --> 330.08]  TSMC is adding fabrication capacity in Japan in anticipation of China's eventual encroachment
[330.08 --> 331.16]  on Taiwan.
[331.66 --> 338.86]  Um, Intel is building up fab capacity at a pace that to my knowledge is, has not been seen
[338.86 --> 347.72]  before from them, um, including in the continental U S um, we've got intense competition for this
[347.72 --> 349.12]  enormous market.
[349.12 --> 356.84]  That is the AI chip market, both from a dedicated chip designers and from the companies that are
[356.84 --> 360.24]  the ones who are procuring these chips like the Microsoft's of the world.
[360.24 --> 365.74]  Um, so I do, I do think that competition is coming.
[366.88 --> 373.94]  However, and this is from someone who would not describe themselves as a fan of NVIDIA's
[373.94 --> 374.96]  way of doing business.
[377.34 --> 382.76]  It's funny because Jensen has actually said very similar things about Intel, but I will say
[382.76 --> 383.66]  this about NVIDIA.
[383.66 --> 391.76]  And that is if NVIDIA were to, for some reason, enter my space, I would immediately be heading
[391.76 --> 392.40]  for the Facebook.
[396.90 --> 397.68]  That's pretty good.
[397.74 --> 398.80]  You're applauding that.
[399.24 --> 399.80]  That's pretty good.
[399.82 --> 401.44]  I assumed you were going for the bell.
[401.54 --> 407.92]  Anyway, uh, the point is they are not a company worthy of the bell that I would bet against.
[407.92 --> 417.20]  Um, and so, you know, if there's a big paradigm shift and traditional GPUs, it don't make as
[417.20 --> 420.66]  much sense as some kind of new AI chip architecture.
[421.00 --> 427.74]  Um, I wouldn't imagine myself, um, you know, savvier and cleverer than NVIDIA in terms of
[427.74 --> 430.70]  figuring that out and being somewhat on top of it.
[430.78 --> 434.68]  With that said, it's not like there aren't other smart people out there.
[434.68 --> 439.24]  Um, and what I'm trying to say is the future is extremely murky.
[439.54 --> 448.00]  I do see how there could be some hesitation around, uh, just projecting, you know, infinite
[448.00 --> 451.62]  growth because that's not how that works.
[451.62 --> 457.36]  And that is a good point that these AI features aren't making money, but just because a space
[457.36 --> 462.26]  isn't making money doesn't mean that there isn't going to be a ton of capital rushing into
[462.26 --> 462.56]  it.
[462.56 --> 466.70]  And as long as these companies keep buying, it doesn't matter now.
[466.78 --> 469.90]  Now, if they're not making money, that could be a sign that they're not going to keep buying,
[470.04 --> 472.94]  but Silicon Valley has often not really cared that much.
[473.22 --> 481.66]  And the intense competition that you guys are noting for the, on the chip side also exists
[481.66 --> 483.08]  on the software side.
[483.16 --> 483.34]  Yeah.
[483.34 --> 488.04]  And that competition, as far as I can tell, has not slowed down at all.
[488.14 --> 495.98]  I mean, at Google, people are sharing internal memes, kind of poking fun at how many AI products
[495.98 --> 502.22]  and how many AI code names Google has for all of the various initiatives that they're running
[502.22 --> 502.68]  right now.
[502.90 --> 504.02]  Something has to power that.
[504.02 --> 508.36]  And that something is NVIDIA for the time being.
[508.36 --> 514.16]  I would love to see, man, can I just dream for a second here?
[515.04 --> 515.24]  Okay.
[515.26 --> 516.30]  We had that whole thing.
[516.38 --> 522.50]  We talked about this a few weeks ago where AMD was like cloak and dagger, like funding,
[522.50 --> 528.14]  like a CUDA translator that could run on AMD GPUs.
[528.14 --> 533.56]  And, and, and so, you know, if I could imagine like an amazing world, it would be one where
[533.56 --> 540.66]  AMD, you know, instead of NVIDIA using gaming to get profitable and build AI stuff, you know,
[540.76 --> 547.96]  AMD sells some AI GPUs and then uses that sick AI money to build better GPUs that they also
[547.96 --> 548.80]  sell to gamers.
[548.80 --> 552.96]  Like, like they flip the whole, they flip the whole thing upside down and then we get like
[552.96 --> 554.84]  real competition in the gaming space.
[554.94 --> 557.32]  But I don't think that's going to happen.
[557.32 --> 561.28]  I mean, AMD has shown time and time again that they are every bit as much a company as
[561.28 --> 562.24]  NVIDIA is.
[562.52 --> 562.56]  Yeah.
[562.74 --> 565.72]  Well, I shouldn't say every bit as much a company as NVIDIA is.
[565.78 --> 570.44]  They are a similar, similar level of just a company to NVIDIA.
[570.90 --> 575.28]  And so they're going to operate in their best corporate interest, but hopefully that remains,
[575.42 --> 579.10]  you know, building GPUs for gamers, please.
[579.24 --> 585.52]  But realistically, I think we could end up waiting for Battlemage to, to be a real threat
[585.52 --> 585.96]  to NVIDIA.
[585.96 --> 587.14]  That's why I've been leaning for a while now.
[587.32 --> 589.74]  I feel like it's going to be Intel eventually.
[589.92 --> 591.34]  I don't necessarily know that it'll be Battlemage.
[591.56 --> 592.16]  Maybe it'll be.
[592.46 --> 593.84]  I don't think it's going to be Battlemage.
[593.94 --> 594.34]  I was dreaming.
[594.46 --> 595.20]  Whatever the C1.
[595.40 --> 596.64]  I was dreaming Celestial.
[596.90 --> 597.10]  Ah.
[597.28 --> 597.46]  Yeah.
[597.54 --> 598.44]  I was dreaming.
[598.86 --> 601.08]  I think after that is, I want to say Druid.
[602.04 --> 603.00]  Arc Druid.
[603.06 --> 603.60]  Is that a thing?
[603.68 --> 605.32]  Have they, have they announced them that far ahead?
[605.32 --> 606.24]  Yeah.
[606.24 --> 606.32]  Yeah.
[606.44 --> 606.58]  Yeah.
[606.88 --> 613.58]  Druid is still just a rumor, but that is, that is, that is understood to be the code
[613.58 --> 613.80]  name.
[613.90 --> 617.02]  So Alchemist, Battlemage, Celestial, Druid.
[617.06 --> 619.38]  And then I don't think we have anything for E.
[619.54 --> 620.02]  Evoker.
[620.24 --> 620.62]  Yet.
[621.30 --> 622.30]  It'll be Evoker.
[622.42 --> 622.90]  Evoker.
[623.14 --> 623.30]  Yeah.
[623.36 --> 623.56]  Really?
[623.78 --> 624.02]  Yeah.
[624.40 --> 624.94]  Not Elf?
[625.78 --> 626.08]  No.
[627.06 --> 627.72]  Not Elfling?
[627.90 --> 628.30]  Elfling?
[628.50 --> 630.46]  Battlemage and Druid are classes.
[631.10 --> 631.36]  Elf is a race.
[631.36 --> 632.64]  Sure, but is Celestial?
[633.34 --> 634.38]  I guess kind of.
[635.40 --> 639.00]  I mean, you could say, you could say, you could say, oh, oh, Enchanter.
[639.66 --> 640.02]  Oh.
[640.28 --> 641.22]  That's pretty good.
[641.58 --> 643.72]  Or, or they could mix it up, Enchantress.
[644.48 --> 644.70]  Yeah.
[644.98 --> 646.20]  Is that PC anymore?
[646.50 --> 647.26]  Literally no idea.
[647.38 --> 648.28]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[648.58 --> 649.00]  You know what?
[649.10 --> 649.98]  Let's play this game.
[651.20 --> 651.76]  I know.
[651.76 --> 654.58]  I promised it would be a short show today because Luke's not feeling well.
[654.58 --> 655.32]  Oh, no.
[655.40 --> 658.36]  But let's, let's play this game with the, okay.
[658.54 --> 660.52]  They could cheat for something like F.
[660.58 --> 662.44]  They could go Fire Mage or something like that.
[662.64 --> 662.92]  Yeah.
[663.12 --> 664.32]  You could kind of cheat it.
[664.42 --> 664.90]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[665.20 --> 666.32]  You could go Flayer.
[667.32 --> 670.54]  You could go with, let's see.
[670.86 --> 671.38]  Oh, Fighter.
[671.88 --> 672.70]  Oh, man.
[673.18 --> 675.20]  Fighters, actually, I kind of like it.
[675.22 --> 678.28]  Fighter 700 would be like a sick name for a graphics card.
[678.68 --> 679.86]  It's the most basic.
[680.18 --> 680.34]  Yeah.
[680.34 --> 682.88]  But it's almost just, it's almost the strongest sounding.
[683.10 --> 683.30]  Yeah.
[683.40 --> 683.66]  Okay.
[683.92 --> 686.90]  I'm going with, I'm going with, we're going to map it out for Intel.
[687.12 --> 691.74]  And if anyone from Intel is watching, we and the community are going to do the rest
[691.74 --> 692.92]  of the work for you guys.
[692.92 --> 694.62]  And then you just have to stick with our roadmap.
[695.02 --> 695.30]  Grenadier?
[696.00 --> 696.36]  Yeah.
[696.88 --> 698.66]  Like Gunner or Grenadier or something.
[698.90 --> 699.08]  Oh, Gunner.
[699.14 --> 703.46]  Why do you keep immediately having something that's way more obvious and way better than mine?
[703.62 --> 705.10]  I don't know if they would go with Gunner, though.
[705.24 --> 705.50]  Okay.
[705.58 --> 706.02]  Hellcat.
[706.46 --> 706.80]  Ooh.
[707.76 --> 709.24]  Give me something here.
[709.24 --> 710.24]  Howitzer.
[710.90 --> 711.22]  Howitzer.
[711.56 --> 712.62]  No, that's not really.
[712.82 --> 712.88]  Yeah.
[713.08 --> 716.00]  I think sticking away from the guns is likely for Intel.
[716.30 --> 717.24]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[717.26 --> 718.56]  There's a lot of weight on that.
[718.66 --> 718.84]  Yeah.
[718.92 --> 721.60]  And like, you know, Mage and Celestial.
[722.40 --> 722.66]  Hunter.
[722.66 --> 722.76]  Hunter.
[723.88 --> 724.64]  That wasn't me.
[724.74 --> 726.06]  That was, that was, that was Floatplane Chat.
[726.18 --> 727.22]  I took that from Floatplane Chat.
[727.28 --> 727.70]  Dang it.
[727.76 --> 728.00]  Okay.
[728.08 --> 728.32]  Okay.
[728.36 --> 728.74]  Hold on.
[728.78 --> 729.06]  Hold on.
[729.10 --> 729.26]  Okay.
[729.34 --> 730.60]  I's got to be Ice something.
[730.60 --> 737.46]  Um, uh, no, no, it could be, I'm trying to do this on my own.
[737.54 --> 738.80]  You're just reading Floatplane Chat.
[738.92 --> 739.82]  That is such a hack.
[739.82 --> 740.08]  All right.
[740.16 --> 740.34]  All right.
[740.40 --> 740.42]  All right.
[740.42 --> 741.08]  That is such a hack.
[741.08 --> 743.90]  I didn't get, the only one I got from there, I said what it was.
[744.10 --> 750.14]  Um, I want to kind of cheat and just go with Invoker instead of Evoker.
[750.14 --> 752.02]  Oh, come on.
[752.82 --> 754.98]  Uh, Illusionist.
[755.10 --> 755.42]  Illusion.
[756.18 --> 758.14]  Ooh, Illusionist is good.
[758.96 --> 763.56]  I'm picturing, uh, man, what's, I'm picturing Job from Arrested Development, though.
[767.82 --> 770.62]  It makes me think of like very old school RPGs.
[770.72 --> 771.06]  Joker?
[772.82 --> 773.78]  Jester, Joker.
[774.18 --> 774.62]  Javelinist?
[775.18 --> 775.46]  Like, J-
[775.46 --> 776.70]  Jouster.
[777.06 --> 777.42]  Joust.
[777.60 --> 778.10]  Dang it.
[779.02 --> 779.68]  Stop it.
[780.14 --> 782.70]  You're actually upsetting me now.
[785.26 --> 786.86]  How about Jackass?
[790.08 --> 791.14]  Jerk face.
[793.26 --> 793.82]  Jackoff.
[793.96 --> 794.20]  No.
[795.20 --> 796.04]  Almost got him.
[797.72 --> 798.70]  Oh my goodness.
[798.90 --> 799.14]  Okay.
[799.56 --> 799.68]  Um.
[800.96 --> 802.54]  That was close.
[802.66 --> 803.34]  Okay, K.
[803.88 --> 805.42]  Oh, K is a tough one.
[805.42 --> 812.10]  You know, they even used it as a codename before.
[812.58 --> 813.78]  Knight's Corner, Knight's Landing.
[814.58 --> 816.48]  That was even freaking a GPU.
[816.86 --> 818.00]  How did I not think of it?
[818.42 --> 818.68]  Sort of.
[818.68 --> 819.78]  This one's going to be really hard.
[820.56 --> 820.94]  J-K.
[821.04 --> 821.72]  Okay, L.
[822.34 --> 822.74]  Lancer.
[822.74 --> 822.86]  Lancer.
[832.06 --> 834.50]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Lightbringer.
[834.60 --> 835.14]  No, okay.
[835.62 --> 835.98]  Lightbringer?
[836.12 --> 836.76]  Why not Lightbringer?
[836.92 --> 838.40]  Well, no, it's more of a name.
[839.06 --> 839.82]  It's less of a...
[839.82 --> 840.80]  Lancer's a class.
[840.86 --> 841.94]  If we're sticking with classes, it's not...
[841.94 --> 844.86]  I feel like Lightbringer could be like a paladin specialization.
[844.96 --> 845.86]  I think Lightbringer's fine.
[846.12 --> 850.20]  Well, yeah, it could be, but it isn't.
[851.08 --> 851.58]  It could be.
[851.96 --> 854.42]  Okay, so, but there's got to be Light something.
[854.60 --> 855.94]  There's got to be like...
[856.84 --> 859.62]  I mean, yeah, I guess we missed kind of some obvious ones.
[859.78 --> 861.88]  Like H could be like Holy Knight or something like that.
[861.94 --> 864.40]  But then, I don't know, we're going to end up with two knights probably.
[864.40 --> 864.98]  Okay, L.
[866.08 --> 866.44]  L.
[868.98 --> 870.52]  You could have like Lunar something.
[870.52 --> 872.88]  You know, Lunar Elf or something like that.
[873.24 --> 873.76]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[873.80 --> 876.56]  Again, that's a race, not a class.
[878.14 --> 879.40]  All right, I'm just looking.
[879.56 --> 880.58]  I'm just looking at Luke.
[881.02 --> 882.54]  No, it's not going to be Luke.
[882.86 --> 883.76]  That'd be so sick.
[883.84 --> 884.46]  Light Llama?
[884.66 --> 886.06]  Why am I even looking at this?
[886.08 --> 887.16]  You guys aren't even helpful.
[887.36 --> 887.54]  Okay.
[887.76 --> 889.20]  I'd ask for no royalties at all.
[889.36 --> 890.28]  Just name it Luke.
[890.78 --> 892.10]  They've already done Battle Mage.
[892.10 --> 894.08]  So, we can't just go straight for Mage.
[894.08 --> 894.68]  Mage, yeah.
[898.14 --> 898.50]  Murderer?
[898.84 --> 900.04]  No, probably not.
[900.04 --> 902.02]  The Intel Arc.
[902.10 --> 903.28]  Seems extremely unlikely.
[903.28 --> 904.24]  The Intel Arc murderer.
[904.36 --> 909.00]  That's more like what would be NVIDIA's codename for whatever they're going to put up against it.
[910.40 --> 910.88]  Mercenary?
[912.00 --> 913.28]  It might be too...
[913.28 --> 914.32]  Like Madman?
[914.74 --> 915.50]  Something like that.
[915.60 --> 916.32]  Ooh, mercenary.
[916.46 --> 917.08]  It's got to be...
[917.08 --> 917.58]  Dang it!
[922.08 --> 922.68]  Marauder?
[923.32 --> 924.08]  Marauder's good.
[924.56 --> 925.12]  Marauder.
[925.12 --> 925.76]  Marauder, yeah.
[925.76 --> 926.60]  It's going to be Marauder.
[926.70 --> 926.94]  Yeah.
[927.54 --> 927.84]  N.
[929.48 --> 930.50]  Oh, Night Elf.
[930.54 --> 931.00]  Nightblade.
[931.38 --> 931.74]  Nightblade.
[932.26 --> 932.74]  Crap.
[933.52 --> 934.44]  Picked a race again.
[934.64 --> 934.84]  Yeah.
[935.22 --> 936.20]  You sure did.
[936.20 --> 937.20]  I'm sorry.
[939.58 --> 940.10]  Okay.
[940.26 --> 940.52]  Oh.
[943.24 --> 943.72]  Oppressor.
[945.18 --> 946.96]  I don't know.
[947.62 --> 949.30]  That sounds like it could be a...
[949.30 --> 950.02]  It's kind of sick.
[950.12 --> 951.42]  I just don't think Intel would do it.
[951.64 --> 951.98]  Oppressor.
[952.58 --> 952.94]  Onslaught.
[953.34 --> 955.54]  Like, overpowerer.
[955.78 --> 956.04]  Like, oh.
[957.14 --> 957.66]  Oh, man.
[958.26 --> 958.56]  Oh, man.
[958.62 --> 959.76]  D could have been like Devourer.
[959.88 --> 960.62]  That would have been kind of cool.
[960.68 --> 961.80]  It's a little graphic, though.
[961.90 --> 962.54]  It's a little graphic.
[962.72 --> 965.58]  I feel like Intel is going to want to be a little bit more...
[965.58 --> 972.24]  And looking at the artwork that they've had so far, it's more like arcane and like high
[972.24 --> 972.70]  fantasy.
[972.98 --> 974.46]  It's not like horror.
[974.72 --> 974.94]  Yeah.
[975.06 --> 975.68]  So, I think...
[975.68 --> 976.64]  Like Devourer.
[977.22 --> 978.26]  It's more Doom.
[978.36 --> 979.52]  It's like demonic, you know?
[980.52 --> 980.68]  Yeah.
[980.68 --> 981.62]  Something like Occult.
[981.74 --> 983.78]  Not only is that not a class, but...
[983.78 --> 984.12]  Yeah.
[984.24 --> 985.54]  I think they wouldn't go that direction anyway.
[985.56 --> 986.20]  The Occultist?
[986.92 --> 987.32]  Occultist.
[987.66 --> 989.04]  That's actually not terrible.
[989.58 --> 990.54]  We don't have a ton of options.
[990.64 --> 991.98]  Oh, like Omen something?
[992.70 --> 993.06]  Omen?
[994.20 --> 994.56]  Omenbringer.
[994.80 --> 995.40]  Like, I don't...
[995.40 --> 995.70]  Okay.
[995.74 --> 996.10]  I don't know.
[996.38 --> 996.64]  What is...
[996.64 --> 997.26]  What is Chad saying?
[997.32 --> 997.76]  Oracle.
[998.56 --> 999.04]  Obviously.
[999.44 --> 999.64]  Yeah.
[999.82 --> 1001.16]  It has to be Oracle.
[1001.38 --> 1001.92]  You guys...
[1001.92 --> 1003.08]  You guys...
[1003.08 --> 1004.74]  Clear W on that one.
[1004.80 --> 1005.12]  Yeah.
[1005.80 --> 1006.20]  Paladin.
[1006.88 --> 1007.26]  Okay.
[1007.78 --> 1008.26]  Yes!
[1008.80 --> 1010.38]  One victory for me!
[1012.72 --> 1013.56]  There you go.
[1013.98 --> 1014.84]  Uh, Q.
[1015.26 --> 1017.26]  It's like Queen or like...
[1018.18 --> 1018.26]  Uh...
[1018.26 --> 1019.42]  Uh...
[1019.42 --> 1019.90]  Hmm.
[1021.56 --> 1023.34]  Is this even final for people?
[1023.46 --> 1024.26]  I have no idea.
[1024.42 --> 1024.86]  Not a clue.
[1024.86 --> 1025.56]  Uh...
[1025.56 --> 1025.94]  Yeah.
[1026.68 --> 1027.82]  People seem engaged.
[1028.16 --> 1028.64]  Quartermaster.
[1028.84 --> 1029.54]  That's not bad.
[1029.68 --> 1030.58]  Quartermaster's pretty good.
[1030.80 --> 1031.60]  That's actually...
[1031.60 --> 1032.42]  That's solid.
[1032.92 --> 1033.94]  I kind of like Quartermaster.
[1034.00 --> 1035.40]  I actually like that a lot.
[1035.50 --> 1036.70]  There's a lot of like...
[1036.70 --> 1038.10]  Queen and...
[1038.10 --> 1038.50]  Quilt.
[1038.72 --> 1039.98]  And you just kind of...
[1039.98 --> 1040.54]  Quiz.
[1040.82 --> 1040.96]  Quilt?
[1041.22 --> 1041.40]  Yeah.
[1041.48 --> 1043.62]  I think Quartermaster is really solid.
[1044.28 --> 1046.88]  I would laugh so hard if they made it Quilt.
[1046.88 --> 1047.72]  Just like...
[1047.72 --> 1048.00]  No.
[1048.76 --> 1050.04]  Like the Quilt Fighter.
[1051.26 --> 1051.50]  What?
[1051.60 --> 1051.96]  He's like...
[1051.96 --> 1053.24]  Just puts a blanket over his head.
[1053.24 --> 1055.10]  He lays down in the corner and just hopes no one notices.
[1055.30 --> 1055.52]  Yeah.
[1055.80 --> 1056.28]  Um...
[1056.28 --> 1057.18]  Security blanket.
[1057.18 --> 1057.58]  Yeah.
[1057.58 --> 1057.68]  Yeah.
[1057.68 --> 1057.78]  Yeah.
[1057.78 --> 1057.80]  Yeah.
[1057.80 --> 1057.88]  Yeah.
[1057.88 --> 1058.28]  Yeah.
[1058.28 --> 1058.38]  Yeah.
[1058.38 --> 1058.48]  Yeah.
[1058.48 --> 1058.78]  Yeah.
[1058.78 --> 1058.98]  Yeah.
[1058.98 --> 1059.08]  Yeah.
[1059.08 --> 1059.28]  Yeah.
[1059.28 --> 1059.48]  Yeah.
[1059.48 --> 1059.58]  Yeah.
[1059.58 --> 1059.68]  Yeah.
[1059.68 --> 1059.98]  Yeah.
[1059.98 --> 1060.08]  Yeah.
[1060.08 --> 1060.60]  Uh...
[1060.60 --> 1061.06]  Q...
[1061.06 --> 1061.52]  R...
[1061.52 --> 1061.90]  R...
[1061.90 --> 1062.46]  Uh...
[1062.46 --> 1063.20]  Ravage...
[1063.20 --> 1063.42]  Rogue?
[1063.74 --> 1064.26]  Oh...
[1064.26 --> 1066.62]  That one's pretty...
[1066.62 --> 1067.16]  S...
[1067.16 --> 1067.64]  Swordsman?
[1068.10 --> 1068.90]  Probably not.
[1069.00 --> 1069.12]  No.
[1069.12 --> 1069.54]  It's too...
[1069.54 --> 1070.38]  It's too simple.
[1070.62 --> 1071.06]  Spellblade?
[1071.86 --> 1072.10]  Oh.
[1072.20 --> 1072.36]  Okay.
[1072.40 --> 1072.96]  That's cool.
[1074.18 --> 1074.74]  Uh...
[1074.74 --> 1075.42]  Sorcerer?
[1075.64 --> 1076.14]  You could...
[1076.14 --> 1076.38]  Yeah.
[1076.46 --> 1077.40]  There's actually so many.
[1077.48 --> 1078.62]  Like Spellbinder.
[1078.88 --> 1079.64]  There's a lot of S's.
[1079.64 --> 1081.36]  You could come up with almost anything for that.
[1081.44 --> 1082.26]  There's tons of S's.
[1082.38 --> 1083.86]  Um...
[1083.86 --> 1084.64]  Samurai.
[1085.10 --> 1085.30]  Yes.
[1085.30 --> 1085.68]  Ooh.
[1085.78 --> 1085.94]  Yeah.
[1085.94 --> 1086.34]  Nice.
[1086.62 --> 1087.46]  That would be pretty sick.
[1087.52 --> 1090.02]  Actually, I think it's gotta have to be Samurai.
[1090.24 --> 1091.02]  Samurai's pretty good.
[1091.02 --> 1094.30]  Just with how much kind of, you know, meiji stuff we've already got.
[1094.34 --> 1095.90]  I don't wanna see, like, Spell...
[1095.90 --> 1096.64]  Spell smooth.
[1096.92 --> 1097.10]  Yeah.
[1097.18 --> 1097.84]  Or anything like that.
[1097.84 --> 1098.66]  I like Samurai, too.
[1099.44 --> 1099.76]  T.
[1099.92 --> 1100.26]  That's good.
[1100.46 --> 1100.82]  Taylor.
[1101.94 --> 1103.12]  It's a popular name.
[1103.66 --> 1104.06]  It's...
[1104.06 --> 1105.88]  Really fast.
[1108.00 --> 1108.72]  The Ark...
[1108.72 --> 1109.48]  The Ark Taylor.
[1109.72 --> 1109.84]  It's...
[1109.84 --> 1110.04]  It's...
[1110.04 --> 1110.70]  It's your bard.
[1110.88 --> 1111.88]  It's just like a...
[1111.88 --> 1112.76]  It's a...
[1112.76 --> 1112.88]  It's a...
[1112.88 --> 1114.64]  Get it?
[1114.66 --> 1115.06]  It's fast?
[1115.24 --> 1115.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1115.70 --> 1116.58]  Yeah, he got there.
[1116.64 --> 1116.78]  Yeah.
[1116.78 --> 1117.74]  It's a little slow today.
[1117.90 --> 1118.08]  Yeah.
[1118.24 --> 1118.60]  Uh, T.
[1118.60 --> 1119.76]  There's, like, Thief...
[1119.76 --> 1120.28]  Oh.
[1120.72 --> 1121.08]  Okay.
[1121.24 --> 1122.56]  Yeah, I don't think they'd want that, though.
[1122.56 --> 1123.08]  I don't think they would want Thief.
[1123.08 --> 1123.32]  No.
[1123.70 --> 1123.98]  No.
[1124.08 --> 1124.70]  No Thief.
[1125.54 --> 1126.22]  Ark...
[1126.22 --> 1127.22]  Ark...
[1127.22 --> 1128.22]  Uh...
[1132.36 --> 1132.98]  So they...
[1132.98 --> 1133.32]  Wait, yeah.
[1133.86 --> 1135.14]  Ark was the first one.
[1135.56 --> 1136.30]  So it could be, like...
[1136.30 --> 1136.80]  Ark Alchemist.
[1137.40 --> 1138.16]  Ark Battlemage.
[1138.38 --> 1139.02]  Ark Celestial.
[1139.78 --> 1140.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1140.56 --> 1140.92]  No, no.
[1140.96 --> 1141.96]  Ark is always part of it.
[1141.96 --> 1142.44]  Okay, okay.
[1142.44 --> 1143.64]  Um...
[1143.64 --> 1144.74]  Ooh, Tempest.
[1145.16 --> 1145.86]  I like that.
[1146.04 --> 1146.54]  I like that.
[1146.88 --> 1147.22]  Tempest.
[1147.82 --> 1148.82]  Tempest is pretty good.
[1148.82 --> 1149.10]  Takes it, I think.
[1149.10 --> 1150.10]  I think that's gotta be the one.
[1150.30 --> 1151.44]  Tinkerer is not bad, though.
[1151.44 --> 1152.40]  Tinkerer is very good.
[1152.42 --> 1154.92]  And very different from everything so far.
[1154.98 --> 1155.14]  Yep.
[1155.14 --> 1159.74]  I mean, at this point, we're talking, like, the roadmap is out into about 2040 or so.
[1159.84 --> 1160.40]  2045.
[1160.86 --> 1163.82]  So we might not even live long enough to see these code names.
[1163.82 --> 1167.28]  And they've probably, like, picked a new naming scheme at this point anyways, but...
[1167.28 --> 1167.98]  Who knows?
[1168.18 --> 1172.52]  Maybe this will be the one time that a company actually sees it through.
[1172.86 --> 1173.82]  Google bailed.
[1174.02 --> 1176.20]  Why did they bail on Android names?
[1176.68 --> 1176.90]  Yeah.
[1177.04 --> 1177.62]  I liked them.
[1177.92 --> 1179.58]  It was so much more memorable.
[1179.64 --> 1181.18]  I can't even keep track of the numbers anymore.
[1181.42 --> 1181.62]  Yeah.
[1181.74 --> 1184.04]  Whereas, like, if you ask me, okay, what did KitKat look like?
[1184.04 --> 1185.38]  I'd be like, oh, yeah, like, kind of like that.
[1185.60 --> 1185.72]  100%.
[1185.72 --> 1186.04]  Yeah.
[1186.20 --> 1186.40]  Yeah.
[1186.56 --> 1186.92]  Honeycomb.
[1187.06 --> 1187.68]  Like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[1187.76 --> 1191.08]  Honeycomb was when we, like, you know, got landscape on tablets and stuff.
[1191.24 --> 1191.56]  Right?
[1191.62 --> 1192.16]  Like, it just...
[1192.16 --> 1193.36]  And it worked better and stuff.
[1193.40 --> 1194.24]  Like, it was more optimized.
[1194.32 --> 1195.48]  Like, I remember those things.
[1196.32 --> 1196.64]  Okay.
[1196.80 --> 1197.00]  Okay.
[1197.04 --> 1197.60]  What did we leave off?
[1197.62 --> 1198.24]  What did we leave off?
[1198.78 --> 1200.48]  Not with it enough to even know, but...
[1200.48 --> 1200.64]  Okay.
[1200.68 --> 1201.68]  We're on you.
[1202.40 --> 1202.66]  You.
[1202.86 --> 1203.06]  Yeah.
[1204.54 --> 1206.18]  Ultra something, probably.
[1206.48 --> 1208.04]  Like, ultra...
[1208.04 --> 1209.04]  Ultra...
[1209.04 --> 1210.96]  Ultraist.
[1212.14 --> 1213.24]  That's not how that spells.
[1213.24 --> 1213.90]  That's an A.
[1214.04 --> 1214.44]  That's...
[1214.44 --> 1215.54]  Thanks.
[1216.10 --> 1218.36]  I mean, I thought it was more B-tier, but I appreciate you.
[1218.50 --> 1218.58]  Oh, wow.
[1218.58 --> 1219.08]  Hey, there we go.
[1219.92 --> 1222.14]  My brain went to Undertaker, but they would never do that.
[1222.30 --> 1222.62]  No.
[1222.86 --> 1223.72]  No, no, no.
[1224.30 --> 1224.52]  No.
[1225.82 --> 1226.18]  Umbra?
[1226.58 --> 1227.36]  Is that like...
[1227.36 --> 1227.74]  Umbra?
[1227.88 --> 1228.44]  What is Umbra?
[1228.50 --> 1230.22]  Isn't that just, like, a soccer brand?
[1230.72 --> 1231.70]  Oh, no, that's Umbro.
[1232.40 --> 1233.04]  Trust them.
[1235.04 --> 1235.36]  Unicorn?
[1236.84 --> 1238.06]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[1238.06 --> 1242.36]  I mean, that'd be cool branding, like Unicorn Rider or something like that, but I just...
[1242.36 --> 1243.14]  I don't see it.
[1243.14 --> 1247.90]  It's not really aligned with what we have so far, which is Alchemist, Battlemage, Celestial
[1247.90 --> 1248.50]  Druid.
[1248.54 --> 1248.96]  I just don't...
[1248.96 --> 1251.60]  I don't see, like, a prancing unicorn.
[1251.86 --> 1252.14]  Usurper!
[1252.40 --> 1253.26]  I like that one.
[1253.58 --> 1254.74]  Oh, that's not bad.
[1255.16 --> 1256.56]  It might feel a little late.
[1256.68 --> 1261.18]  Like, I would assume that we're not gonna get to Usurper if they haven't usurped anything
[1261.18 --> 1261.60]  by then.
[1261.60 --> 1262.88]  Yeah, that's pretty fair.
[1263.04 --> 1263.86]  I do like it, though.
[1263.96 --> 1264.32]  Ultima?
[1264.46 --> 1265.16]  That's pretty sick.
[1265.42 --> 1265.96]  Yeah, it's...
[1265.96 --> 1267.06]  That's a spell, though.
[1267.74 --> 1267.94]  Right?
[1268.00 --> 1269.32]  Like, that's not...
[1269.32 --> 1270.86]  It's gonna be Ultra something.
[1271.10 --> 1273.08]  Ultra blade or Ultra...
[1273.08 --> 1274.60]  Ultra something.
[1275.16 --> 1276.62]  But I don't know exactly what.
[1276.62 --> 1280.76]  Conrad says, Gemini says, Umbra-list, untamer, and urchin.
[1281.26 --> 1282.44]  Yeah, it's definitely...
[1282.44 --> 1287.12]  So, Umbra is the fully shaded inner region of a shadow cast by an opaque object, especially
[1287.12 --> 1291.18]  the area on the Earth or Moon experiencing a total phase of an eclipse.
[1291.68 --> 1298.36]  It is often used in video games to describe, like, something shadowy, something you should
[1298.36 --> 1299.16]  be concerned about.
[1299.34 --> 1301.18]  There's a sword in Morrowind called Umbra.
[1301.30 --> 1302.22]  The Umbra-list.
[1302.44 --> 1303.58]  That, like, uh...
[1303.58 --> 1304.62]  Yeah, I don't think that's good.
[1304.62 --> 1306.62]  Compels the wielder to...
[1306.62 --> 1307.76]  Okay.
[1307.94 --> 1308.18]  Pwn.
[1308.44 --> 1309.18]  Ultra something.
[1309.90 --> 1310.18]  Yeah.
[1310.76 --> 1311.36]  B.
[1311.52 --> 1312.56]  That one's kind of unfortunate.
[1313.18 --> 1314.74]  The violence giver.
[1316.82 --> 1317.46]  The...
[1317.46 --> 1318.14]  The...
[1318.14 --> 1318.98]  Venge...
[1318.98 --> 1320.16]  Venge something.
[1320.34 --> 1320.98]  I need to close this.
[1321.40 --> 1322.20]  The Venger.
[1322.50 --> 1323.30]  Uh...
[1323.30 --> 1325.20]  Well, for you...
[1325.20 --> 1325.94]  It's not A.
[1326.08 --> 1326.78]  Which is not good.
[1326.88 --> 1327.68]  Ventriloquist.
[1328.12 --> 1329.40]  The violinist.
[1329.58 --> 1331.12]  Everyone's fighting, you're just like...
[1331.12 --> 1332.94]  I mean, they don't have a bard yet, so...
[1332.94 --> 1333.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1333.90 --> 1335.54]  Unless they go with my pitch for T.
[1335.96 --> 1336.46]  The tailor.
[1339.28 --> 1339.90]  V for...
[1339.90 --> 1341.68]  The violence wreaker.
[1342.16 --> 1343.74]  I am stealing this from Chad.
[1343.80 --> 1345.64]  I saw this before I closed the screen, but Viper.
[1346.60 --> 1347.36]  Um...
[1347.36 --> 1348.12]  It's okay.
[1348.28 --> 1350.56]  It could be like a rogue specialization, maybe.
[1350.80 --> 1351.12]  Yeah.
[1351.34 --> 1353.86]  But it's a little, like, poison-based rogue or something.
[1353.90 --> 1354.16]  Yeah.
[1354.54 --> 1354.96]  The...
[1354.96 --> 1355.46]  Um...
[1355.46 --> 1356.58]  The vasectomy giver.
[1356.58 --> 1356.98]  Um...
[1356.98 --> 1357.18]  The vasectomy giver.
[1357.18 --> 1357.50]  Pffft.
[1357.50 --> 1357.82]  Pffft.
[1357.82 --> 1358.40]  Pffft.
[1358.40 --> 1359.02]  Just...
[1359.02 --> 1359.50]  Just...
[1359.50 --> 1361.88]  I could see a D&D campaign based around that.
[1361.92 --> 1362.42]  I will...
[1362.42 --> 1364.48]  I will eliminate your offspring!
[1364.48 --> 1364.98]  Pffft.
[1364.98 --> 1365.48]  Pffft.
[1365.48 --> 1365.98]  Pffft.
[1365.98 --> 1366.48]  Pffft.
[1366.48 --> 1366.98]  Pffft.
[1366.98 --> 1369.28]  We won't win this war this year.
[1369.40 --> 1370.28]  Or next year.
[1370.76 --> 1372.44]  But give us a generation or two!
[1372.44 --> 1373.08]  We'll win this war in...
[1373.08 --> 1374.50]  In generations from now.
[1374.80 --> 1376.66]  If only it wasn't a real thing.
[1377.76 --> 1378.32]  Yeah.
[1378.52 --> 1378.92]  Yeah.
[1379.10 --> 1379.44]  Uh...
[1379.44 --> 1379.70]  Okay.
[1379.82 --> 1380.56]  So V then.
[1381.02 --> 1382.02]  Um...
[1382.02 --> 1385.04]  I mean, it's for Vendetta, obviously, right?
[1385.12 --> 1385.70]  But...
[1385.70 --> 1386.94]  The Vendetta-er.
[1387.56 --> 1387.98]  Okay.
[1388.04 --> 1389.04]  Do you guys have anything?
[1389.32 --> 1389.60]  Vanguard!
[1389.88 --> 1390.18]  Dang it!
[1390.22 --> 1391.02]  How'd we not think of that?
[1391.04 --> 1391.14]  Hey!
[1391.14 --> 1391.46]  Yep!
[1391.56 --> 1391.80]  Yep!
[1391.86 --> 1392.00]  Yep!
[1392.00 --> 1392.20]  Alright.
[1392.52 --> 1392.88]  Vulture!
[1393.06 --> 1394.08]  That's not bad either.
[1394.24 --> 1395.28]  Vanguard, I think, is it.
[1395.32 --> 1396.38]  No, it's gotta be Vulture!
[1396.90 --> 1397.14]  Really?
[1397.54 --> 1397.90]  Yeah!
[1398.02 --> 1398.46]  It's Vanguard.
[1398.76 --> 1399.32]  What?!
[1399.32 --> 1400.26]  It's Vanguard for sure.
[1400.26 --> 1401.40]  Man, settle this.
[1403.02 --> 1403.52]  Uh, Vanguard.
[1403.76 --> 1403.88]  Yeah.
[1404.12 --> 1404.30]  Yeah.
[1405.04 --> 1405.48]  Pffft.
[1405.82 --> 1406.14]  Yeah, God.
[1406.14 --> 1406.48]  All right.
[1407.16 --> 1408.26]  T-U-V-W...
[1408.26 --> 1408.94]  Okay, W.
[1409.56 --> 1410.60]  Uh, War Horse.
[1410.76 --> 1411.04]  Wizard.
[1411.04 --> 1411.38]  Warlord.
[1412.78 --> 1413.58]  Warlord's pretty good.
[1413.94 --> 1415.18]  I think Warlord's cooler than Wizard.
[1415.70 --> 1416.10]  Warlock?
[1416.40 --> 1416.80]  Warlock?
[1416.90 --> 1417.20]  Warlock.
[1417.22 --> 1418.50]  All right, we'll just go with that.
[1418.54 --> 1419.62]  I think Warlock might win.
[1419.74 --> 1420.66]  Yay, we got one!
[1421.06 --> 1421.78]  All right, X.
[1422.38 --> 1423.10]  X-Man.
[1425.24 --> 1426.62]  They just collab with him.
[1426.82 --> 1428.32]  He's like, whatever, we couldn't think of a name.
[1428.54 --> 1433.18]  Yeah, well, that was like, uh, Google did with, um, Nestle or whatever, for KitKat.
[1433.46 --> 1433.76]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1433.76 --> 1435.38]  They were like, okay, we have nothing for K.
[1435.78 --> 1439.08]  So we're gonna, we're gonna, like, license this thing that we can call it.
[1439.68 --> 1441.02]  Like, we'll work with them on it.
[1441.02 --> 1442.90]  Um, so it's actually just X-Man?
[1443.18 --> 1444.78]  I feel like there's gotta be some too.
[1444.78 --> 1444.82]  Xenomorph.
[1445.12 --> 1445.62]  That's something.
[1445.76 --> 1446.50]  That's, that's chat.
[1446.58 --> 1447.80]  Chat gets credit for that one.
[1448.12 --> 1449.08]  Is that a class?
[1449.52 --> 1452.04]  They could just call it, they could just call it the Warrior Princess.
[1454.42 --> 1454.82]  Xena.
[1454.82 --> 1454.90]  Yeah.
[1455.42 --> 1455.82]  Um.
[1455.86 --> 1457.44]  Xena actually sounds pretty cool.
[1457.94 --> 1460.74]  Yeah, but I'm pretty sure it would have a similar issue to X-Man.
[1460.98 --> 1461.20]  Yeah.
[1461.34 --> 1461.52]  Yeah.
[1462.24 --> 1462.80]  You know what?
[1462.82 --> 1466.04]  Let's just go with, um, yeah, Xenomorph would have the same problem, too.
[1466.10 --> 1471.04]  That's, that's certainly copyrighted or whatever the, yeah, copyrighted or protected in some
[1471.04 --> 1471.20]  way.
[1471.98 --> 1474.00]  Um, Xeno, Xenoblade.
[1474.16 --> 1475.02]  Oh, no, that's a thing.
[1475.18 --> 1475.40]  Crap.
[1475.56 --> 1477.20]  Uh, Xeno something, probably.
[1477.56 --> 1477.82]  Yeah.
[1477.82 --> 1480.04]  Um, okay, why?
[1482.44 --> 1483.28]  Yak Rider.
[1485.34 --> 1486.76]  I kinda like that.
[1486.96 --> 1488.28]  I can't think of much.
[1488.78 --> 1489.22]  Um.
[1489.40 --> 1490.56]  Um, the Yakker.
[1490.94 --> 1494.32]  Right, right, cause we don't have a, we don't have like a, like a charismatic.
[1495.72 --> 1496.68]  The Yakker.
[1496.74 --> 1497.46]  The Yakker.
[1498.36 --> 1500.06]  That's a horrible name.
[1500.36 --> 1501.26]  Oh my god.
[1502.30 --> 1502.78]  Um.
[1502.90 --> 1506.18]  Did you just, did you just do a takedown of my entire class?
[1506.18 --> 1509.64]  Literally my job.
[1509.80 --> 1512.04]  It's funny because what I first jumped to was Yappy.
[1514.20 --> 1514.44]  Ha ha ha.
[1514.44 --> 1515.30]  Ha ha ha.
[1516.66 --> 1517.28]  Ha ha ha.
[1517.28 --> 1517.48]  Okay.
[1518.24 --> 1518.68]  Um.
[1518.78 --> 1519.58]  Alright, I'm going to chat.
[1520.12 --> 1520.78]  Yeah, what do they got?
[1521.20 --> 1521.60]  YOLO?
[1522.10 --> 1522.36]  Ugh.
[1522.56 --> 1523.40]  Yurf dog?
[1523.56 --> 1523.84]  What?
[1523.94 --> 1525.90]  Wow, you guys aren't even trying anymore.
[1526.12 --> 1527.76]  Yggdrasil is not like a.
[1527.76 --> 1528.30]  The Yankee.
[1528.30 --> 1529.34]  Yeah, but it's a cool word.
[1529.70 --> 1530.50]  It is a cool word.
[1530.64 --> 1532.08]  What, what's a, what's a Yankee?
[1532.24 --> 1533.92]  It like rides into battle.
[1534.02 --> 1534.34]  Yodeler.
[1534.74 --> 1535.20]  There you go.
[1535.26 --> 1535.94]  The Yodeler.
[1536.18 --> 1537.22]  I mean, sure.
[1537.98 --> 1538.42]  Um.
[1540.62 --> 1541.02]  Ugh.
[1542.32 --> 1542.72]  Yelman.
[1543.84 --> 1544.64]  That's something.
[1545.26 --> 1546.88]  Which is more than what we had.
[1548.16 --> 1549.32]  You missed Ark?
[1549.84 --> 1550.06]  What?
[1550.80 --> 1551.04]  No?
[1551.48 --> 1551.64]  What?
[1552.18 --> 1553.00]  Uh, yeah.
[1553.16 --> 1554.72]  Yelman is, Yelman is decent.
[1554.92 --> 1555.94]  I say we go with that.
[1556.90 --> 1557.32]  Yelman?
[1558.00 --> 1560.14]  It's like a Shaman, but cooler?
[1560.52 --> 1561.08]  I guess so.
[1561.68 --> 1562.82]  I don't think so.
[1562.92 --> 1563.86]  I forget what they do.
[1565.16 --> 1565.52]  Yelman.
[1566.24 --> 1569.32]  Uh, a man holding and cultivating a small landed estate.
[1569.34 --> 1569.66]  Oh.
[1569.66 --> 1570.28]  A freeholder.
[1570.46 --> 1570.80]  Oh, yeah.
[1570.98 --> 1571.14]  I know.
[1571.42 --> 1573.86]  I, I thought you were saying like Y-A-M-M-A.
[1573.86 --> 1574.24]  No, yeah.
[1574.24 --> 1576.00]  It's not, it's not like Yelman, sir.
[1577.64 --> 1577.96]  That!
[1579.24 --> 1581.32]  I mean, funnily enough, it is like a shout-based barbarian.
[1581.32 --> 1581.92]  Shout-out attack.
[1582.00 --> 1582.26]  Yeah.
[1582.54 --> 1582.72]  Yeah.
[1582.72 --> 1582.82]  Yeah.
[1583.04 --> 1583.40]  Um.
[1584.56 --> 1584.96]  Okay.
[1586.08 --> 1586.44]  Sure.
[1586.44 --> 1587.34]  We can't do Yakuza.
[1587.38 --> 1588.28]  They can't do Yakuza.
[1588.66 --> 1589.04]  That's not.
[1589.16 --> 1591.42]  Yeah, that's definitely not gonna be a thing.
[1591.54 --> 1591.80]  No.
[1592.76 --> 1593.44]  Yeezy collab?
[1593.70 --> 1594.02]  No.
[1594.02 --> 1595.02]  No.
[1595.02 --> 1595.98]  It's, no.
[1596.82 --> 1597.60]  All right, Z.
[1600.82 --> 1601.14]  Zapper.
[1602.52 --> 1603.90]  Oh, Conrad's got it.
[1603.96 --> 1606.22]  He might have got it from Gemini, I'm not sure, but Zealot.
[1606.48 --> 1607.00]  Oh, Zealot.
[1607.08 --> 1608.38]  Okay, yeah, that's gonna have to be it.
[1608.58 --> 1608.80]  Okay.
[1609.44 --> 1610.88]  Man, what did we do for S?
[1611.08 --> 1612.16]  Zapper wouldn't have been bad.
[1613.16 --> 1614.82]  There was, there was like too many for S.
[1614.82 --> 1615.90]  Oh, there was too many for S.
[1615.94 --> 1616.54]  Yeah, that's right.
[1616.64 --> 1617.62]  Oh, there's so many good ones.
[1617.82 --> 1618.16]  A million options.
[1618.16 --> 1619.40]  Can I, can I have Zapper?
[1621.90 --> 1622.88]  Zapper's pretty good.
[1623.24 --> 1625.70]  Is Intel gonna wanna call their thing Zapper?
[1625.96 --> 1627.86]  I think you could, I think you could.
[1627.86 --> 1629.22]  I think with cool enough branding.
[1630.00 --> 1633.66]  Zapper fits into what we have established so far.
[1634.64 --> 1635.04]  Swashbuckler.
[1635.12 --> 1636.42]  Dang, there's so many S's.
[1637.60 --> 1638.00]  Fine.
[1638.94 --> 1639.34]  Zookeeper.
[1639.78 --> 1641.82]  All right, let's go into topic number two.
[1641.82 --> 1644.24]  I don't even remember what topic number one was anymore.
[1644.44 --> 1648.20]  There was a bit of an ending on topic number one, which is NVIDIA has also launched a beta
[1648.20 --> 1653.12]  for the NVIDIA app, which finally merges features of GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA
[1653.12 --> 1654.82]  control panel on Windows.
[1655.00 --> 1663.56]  It offers account-based awards, but thank goodness, finally, doesn't require login to use.
[1664.32 --> 1665.76]  It actually looks super cool.
[1665.86 --> 1669.92]  They also launched, I believe it's in beta right now, but they also launched a new feature.
[1669.92 --> 1678.02]  So the AI-powered SDR to HDR video conversion that they've had available for some time now
[1678.02 --> 1680.96]  is now available as a toggle in the new driver.
[1681.54 --> 1685.62]  And this is a really well-timed launch from them going, hey, try our new driver.
[1685.62 --> 1692.52]  Not only is it a new driver and the first time we've updated our look in 20 years or however
[1692.52 --> 1697.72]  long it's been since they first launched the NVIDIA control panel, but we've got this very
[1697.72 --> 1701.50]  compelling new feature that people might want to try.
[1701.62 --> 1708.36]  So it's an automatic SDR to HDR converter for games, which already exists, at least in Windows,
[1708.56 --> 1711.46]  but is now powered by AI or something.
[1711.46 --> 1712.40]  I haven't tried it yet.
[1712.76 --> 1717.92]  We were working on a video on the video version, and then we were going to kind of touch on
[1717.92 --> 1721.84]  the hacky way that some folks found to enable it in games.
[1722.32 --> 1725.76]  But now we're just going to bundle those two together and we're going to do a video on
[1725.76 --> 1733.02]  HDR or SDR to HDR conversion because there's a lot of HDR monitors out there now at this point.
[1733.28 --> 1736.76]  If you consider TVs monitors, there's a ton of them.
[1736.76 --> 1742.32]  Basically, every TV in the last few years over the very, very entry level has been HDR
[1742.32 --> 1746.20]  capable and in many cases more capable than the entry level HDR monitors.
[1746.82 --> 1753.88]  So anyone who's gaming on a TV, a relatively recent TV, is going to be able to take advantage
[1753.88 --> 1760.02]  of this in a big way because there's still a significant shortage of HDR content, particularly
[1760.02 --> 1761.08]  on the video side.
[1761.08 --> 1765.96]  Like if you go, like if you just, you know, look at, look for any movie you enjoy.
[1766.04 --> 1772.00]  Here, pick a movie you enjoyed as a kid that you think is, you know, probably not a huge
[1772.00 --> 1772.36]  deal.
[1772.58 --> 1775.02]  You know, it's not Lord of the Rings, but just some movie you liked.
[1775.92 --> 1777.34]  He's going to out himself here.
[1777.70 --> 1778.14]  Oh man.
[1778.14 --> 1778.92]  No, I just, I just.
[1778.98 --> 1780.50]  It's, it's, it's white chicks, isn't it?
[1780.56 --> 1781.34]  All right, I'll look it up.
[1781.44 --> 1782.00]  White chicks.
[1782.16 --> 1783.70]  You just, you cut me off at the pass.
[1783.76 --> 1785.36]  I was going to say Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring.
[1785.44 --> 1786.90]  And then you were like, can't be that.
[1786.98 --> 1788.90]  I was like, all right, fair enough.
[1788.90 --> 1791.52]  I've never watched like a ton of movies.
[1791.90 --> 1793.20]  Um, original Top Gun.
[1794.72 --> 1795.24]  Okay.
[1795.76 --> 1796.18]  Yeah.
[1796.26 --> 1797.68]  Top Gun, man.
[1797.82 --> 1798.00]  Okay.
[1798.06 --> 1800.32]  Top Gun probably does have an HDR release.
[1801.24 --> 1802.44]  Uh, what was it?
[1802.52 --> 1803.16]  1988?
[1804.54 --> 1805.36]  Uh, night.
[1805.90 --> 1806.76]  Shut up.
[1806.78 --> 1808.14]  It's not from 1980.
[1808.14 --> 1808.70]  Is it?
[1809.18 --> 1809.58]  1986.
[1810.40 --> 1811.08]  All right.
[1812.96 --> 1817.06]  Uh, man, I can't believe Tom Cruise has been cool as long as I've been alive.
[1818.90 --> 1820.02]  Mind blowing.
[1820.74 --> 1821.08]  Yeah.
[1821.30 --> 1822.16]  Uh, no.
[1822.30 --> 1825.78]  Top Gun did get a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.
[1826.04 --> 1830.12]  So it, it is available, uh, with, in Dolby Vision.
[1830.32 --> 1838.00]  But my point is that there are a lot of older movies that are not available in HDR in any
[1838.00 --> 1840.42]  release format that's at decent quality.
[1840.52 --> 1843.52]  There's a lot that do have HDR releases through streaming platforms.
[1843.52 --> 1854.30]  But if I could watch the Blu-ray with a light AI upscaling and with a good SDR to HDR conversion,
[1854.74 --> 1861.16]  I think I'm at the point now where I understand and I accept that that's the best I'm ever
[1861.16 --> 1861.66]  going to get.
[1861.78 --> 1866.28]  And I think I could settle for that because HDR 4K Blu-ray is dying.
[1866.62 --> 1867.72]  Ooh, original Tron.
[1867.84 --> 1868.10]  Yeah.
[1868.10 --> 1871.28]  That probably got the HDR.
[1871.48 --> 1872.24]  You've seen that, right?
[1873.24 --> 1873.64]  Um.
[1873.98 --> 1874.28]  Oh.
[1874.94 --> 1875.84]  I haven't.
[1875.92 --> 1876.30]  Wow.
[1876.76 --> 1879.18]  Hey, speaking of which, have you played any Final Fantasy VI?
[1879.64 --> 1879.98]  No.
[1880.68 --> 1880.86]  Oh.
[1881.06 --> 1884.40]  I wanted to this week, but if I wasn't working, I was generally sleeping.
[1884.58 --> 1884.84]  Yeah.
[1884.84 --> 1885.08]  Right.
[1885.08 --> 1885.58]  The whole week, so.
[1886.28 --> 1888.66]  Who would like to see a 4K remaster of original Tron?
[1888.72 --> 1890.78]  No, it appears it has not gotten the treatment.
[1890.94 --> 1892.40]  Apparently neither has Robocop.
[1892.98 --> 1893.90]  Uh, Shaun of the Dead.
[1894.24 --> 1897.82]  I doubt Shaun of the Dead is getting a HDR 4K, whatever.
[1898.02 --> 1899.18]  I would, I like that movie.
[1899.52 --> 1899.96]  Um.
[1900.96 --> 1904.16]  What was Shaun of the Dead shot on?
[1904.96 --> 1905.60]  Would it even?
[1906.46 --> 1907.70]  Shut up.
[1908.20 --> 1911.34]  It was shot on film with RE cameras.
[1911.34 --> 1917.32]  There would be enough dynamic range there, and enough resolution for them to do it, if
[1917.32 --> 1919.66]  anyone was motivated enough to do it.
[1920.10 --> 1922.08]  And it really is, it's a great movie.
[1922.18 --> 1923.00]  It's so good.
[1923.40 --> 1928.24]  I'm not even a huge fan of the zombie movie genre, so I'm sure there were references that
[1928.24 --> 1933.70]  I didn't get and stuff like that, but it was, it was absolutely a blast.
[1933.82 --> 1935.50]  And I love Simon Pegg.
[1935.50 --> 1940.82]  Uh, I just think he is one of those people who's naturally hilarious, no matter what
[1940.82 --> 1941.20]  he's doing.
[1941.28 --> 1941.78]  It's incredible.
[1943.30 --> 1944.64]  It's a Galaxy Quest.
[1945.16 --> 1946.66]  Oh, oh, so good.
[1946.74 --> 1949.20]  Speaking of actors that I love no matter what they're doing.
[1949.76 --> 1953.52]  Um, oh my God, why can't I remember his name right now?
[1953.54 --> 1954.78]  This is so embarrassing.
[1955.46 --> 1956.86]  Uh, Alan Rickman.
[1957.12 --> 1957.48]  Jeez.
[1957.60 --> 1958.00]  Oh, wow.
[1958.14 --> 1958.98]  Yeah, Alan Rickman.
[1959.12 --> 1960.58]  Man, he's awesome.
[1960.70 --> 1961.66]  He's fantastic in everything.
[1961.82 --> 1962.32]  He's awesome.
[1962.36 --> 1963.68]  Have you seen Galaxy Quest?
[1963.84 --> 1964.12]  Yeah.
[1964.12 --> 1964.20]  Yeah.
[1964.54 --> 1965.00]  Oh, okay.
[1965.42 --> 1966.02]  Parts of it.
[1966.38 --> 1967.48]  By Grapp-Thor's hand.
[1967.52 --> 1968.38]  Oh man, he's so good.
[1968.44 --> 1969.68]  I haven't seen the whole thing, but I've seen parts of it.
[1969.68 --> 1969.88]  You haven't?
[1970.28 --> 1970.64]  What?
[1971.08 --> 1971.38]  Yeah.
[1971.92 --> 1975.58]  How can you watch part of a movie like that and not watch the whole thing?
[1975.66 --> 1977.08]  I just don't really watch stuff that often.
[1979.86 --> 1982.08]  I guarantee you've seen parts of Original Tron.
[1982.20 --> 1982.98]  You ever watch the whole thing?
[1983.06 --> 1984.06]  No, I've never seen any of it.
[1984.26 --> 1984.74]  Wow, really?
[1984.94 --> 1985.18]  Yeah.
[1985.28 --> 1991.08]  I mean, I, when would I, okay, we either had it on VHS when I was a kid, or I haven't seen
[1991.08 --> 1991.16]  it.
[1991.16 --> 1992.04]  We never owned it.
[1992.38 --> 1993.24]  Where would I have seen it?
[1993.24 --> 1994.00]  Like, Galaxy Quest.
[1994.06 --> 1995.62]  I never had, like, access to it.
[1996.30 --> 1997.64]  Well, where did you see it?
[1997.68 --> 1999.00]  How do you see parts of movies?
[1999.00 --> 1999.40]  Sailing the seas.
[1999.92 --> 2001.74]  People reference it all the time.
[2002.32 --> 2003.74]  There's, like, YouTube things on it.
[2004.64 --> 2005.30]  Stuff like that.
[2005.40 --> 2005.92]  Oh, okay.
[2006.08 --> 2006.30]  Yeah.
[2006.62 --> 2006.94]  All right.
[2007.28 --> 2007.72]  Fair enough.
[2008.44 --> 2009.68]  Well, it might be a psycho.
[2009.86 --> 2010.12]  Maybe.
[2010.32 --> 2010.76]  I don't know.
[2011.10 --> 2015.96]  I get, I like, I get too distracted watching, like, TVs and shows.
[2015.96 --> 2018.54]  Like, if I, TVs and shows.
[2018.82 --> 2019.54]  Oh, man.
[2020.16 --> 2021.92]  Um, if I'm watching something with somebody.
[2021.92 --> 2022.78]  Well, that's why you're distracted.
[2022.92 --> 2023.84]  You got all these TVs.
[2024.38 --> 2027.22]  How are you supposed to pay attention to any of the movies you're watching?
[2027.36 --> 2029.26]  My, my living room is just like.
[2029.40 --> 2030.98]  Types of Luke's movie reviews.
[2031.38 --> 2032.78]  Really disjointed story.
[2032.88 --> 2036.46]  It felt like if they'd had five, six more of a movie there, there really would have been
[2036.46 --> 2036.86]  something.
[2037.22 --> 2040.26]  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I had half a dozen movies going at the
[2040.26 --> 2040.86]  same time.
[2040.86 --> 2041.26]  Maybe.
[2041.98 --> 2042.54]  Not sure.
[2042.68 --> 2044.64]  That seems like a movie problem, not a me problem.
[2045.96 --> 2046.96]  Uh, yeah.
[2048.64 --> 2049.28]  Uh, yeah.
[2049.36 --> 2052.82]  I was, I was saying like my, my living room is like those old, like 90 sets with like just
[2052.82 --> 2054.14]  the tower of CRTs.
[2054.30 --> 2055.94]  It's like, yeah, that's how I watch TV.
[2056.96 --> 2057.40]  Uh.
[2057.46 --> 2058.22]  That's how I watch TVs.
[2058.48 --> 2064.02]  I guess it's time for us to talk about the big Reddit licensing deal with Google slash
[2064.02 --> 2064.46]  Yeah.
[2064.64 --> 2066.10]  Reddit goes public.
[2066.76 --> 2070.84]  Reddit filed its initial public offering yesterday to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
[2070.86 --> 2072.64]  as RDDT.
[2073.02 --> 2077.88]  According to the company, in addition to offering stock to institutional investors, they will
[2077.88 --> 2084.28]  also be offering it to its top users, including moderators based on Reddit karma.
[2085.36 --> 2085.58]  Hmm.
[2085.58 --> 2089.26]  I knew that karma was going to be worth something someday.
[2089.92 --> 2092.08]  Too bad it's Reddit stock.
[2092.44 --> 2093.12]  Yeah.
[2093.12 --> 2093.56]  Uh.
[2094.62 --> 2102.80]  With that said, Reddit has some news, obviously timed to help boost it during the IPO to share
[2102.80 --> 2106.98]  that makes it seem like maybe not just an endless money pit forever.
[2107.28 --> 2107.46]  What?
[2107.46 --> 2113.82]  Reddit confirmed a leak, claiming it had struck a content licensing deal with a major AI company.
[2114.38 --> 2118.88]  Google will apparently have direct access to Reddit's API for the purpose of training data.
[2119.30 --> 2124.62]  The deal is rumored to be worth 60 million US dollars annually to Reddit.
[2125.02 --> 2130.86]  The filing likewise revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is the third largest shareholder
[2130.86 --> 2137.62]  in Reddit with 8.7% of the shares compared to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman's 3.3%.
[2137.62 --> 2139.58]  Of course he's in there somewhere.
[2140.46 --> 2150.58]  So, um, the whole thing where, you know, you create the value for the site, where the site
[2150.58 --> 2153.58]  is free to use because you're the product.
[2154.30 --> 2154.56]  Yeah.
[2156.54 --> 2157.64]  There's your, there's your evidence.
[2157.90 --> 2158.58]  There it is.
[2158.66 --> 2159.66]  There it is right there.
[2159.70 --> 2160.40]  Everybody knows.
[2160.82 --> 2161.44]  I don't know.
[2161.50 --> 2162.02]  Do they though?
[2162.14 --> 2164.70]  I actually am not, no, I am not convinced of that.
[2164.80 --> 2169.72]  I had a family dinner not that long ago and I had a relative ask me, well, how do you
[2169.72 --> 2170.50]  make money on YouTube?
[2171.50 --> 2174.72]  And I was like, how do they make money with TV?
[2175.66 --> 2178.76]  Like ads and, and, and like product placements.
[2179.10 --> 2181.28]  What, what, what are you asking?
[2181.36 --> 2182.76]  How does anybody make money on anything?
[2182.76 --> 2188.36]  Like, I think, I think people just, especially older generation people, no, no, fundamentally
[2188.36 --> 2194.72]  do not understand that the internet costs money even necessarily.
[2195.40 --> 2195.50]  Yeah.
[2195.86 --> 2200.20]  Like, like the, the, the idea that Reddit might need tens of millions of dollars in order
[2200.20 --> 2204.18]  to operate is just why it's just a page of text, right?
[2204.18 --> 2206.42]  Like that can't be that hard, right?
[2206.42 --> 2208.56]  Like it might be a lot cheaper if it was just a page of text.
[2209.24 --> 2213.70]  I suspect it has to do a lot with Reddit video and lots of other things they have going
[2213.70 --> 2215.84]  on their picture and video hosting.
[2216.26 --> 2219.68]  There was, there was sites that cropped up in the early Reddit days.
[2219.76 --> 2223.96]  I think imager is one of them, but I'm pretty sure there was other ones as well where their
[2223.96 --> 2228.18]  whole thing was that they were a host for video and pictures that went on Reddit.
[2229.06 --> 2232.56]  And then I think Reddit saw that and was like, Oh, we want to move this in house, but
[2232.56 --> 2235.10]  that just costs insane amounts of money.
[2235.64 --> 2237.72]  So there's a couple of discussion questions here.
[2237.80 --> 2239.90]  One is how will going public change Reddit?
[2240.10 --> 2244.84]  I mean, I don't think at all compared to how they've been behaving recently since everything
[2244.84 --> 2250.06]  they've done over the last couple of years has been in the lead up to going public and
[2250.06 --> 2253.32]  trying to juice the value as much as humanly possible.
[2253.32 --> 2261.62]  Um, I guess what, what I want to know is how, how, yeah, no, I guess I don't really want
[2261.62 --> 2262.10]  to know anything.
[2262.22 --> 2262.72]  Oh, right.
[2262.78 --> 2262.96]  Yes.
[2262.98 --> 2264.02]  I remember what I want to know.
[2264.38 --> 2267.06]  I want to know if you would invest in Reddit.
[2267.28 --> 2267.54]  No.
[2268.24 --> 2269.48]  Well, hold on a second though.
[2270.40 --> 2272.90]  Would you have said the same thing when Facebook went IPO?
[2272.90 --> 2277.38]  When did they go IPO?
[2278.12 --> 2280.26]  Oh man, it was like 10, 12 years ago.
[2280.50 --> 2281.42]  Then probably.
[2281.96 --> 2283.38]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2283.44 --> 2285.44]  Facebook IPO versus today.
[2285.58 --> 2285.92]  Hold on.
[2286.44 --> 2296.16]  So Facebook has been, uh, well, I think a five, a five banger for people who invested.
[2296.86 --> 2297.42]  Hold on.
[2297.50 --> 2300.66]  IPO price of $38 around at today's price.
[2300.66 --> 2301.46]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2301.58 --> 2303.64]  Today's price of around 191 per share.
[2303.72 --> 2304.82]  This article is from 2019.
[2305.06 --> 2305.20]  Okay.
[2305.22 --> 2307.10]  Where is the stupid, how much are they worth today?
[2307.72 --> 2314.76]  Uh, so they went IPO at apparently $38 on the first trading day and then, uh, Facebook
[2314.76 --> 2315.96]  stock price.
[2316.12 --> 2317.14]  So what are we at now?
[2317.90 --> 2318.30]  484.
[2318.44 --> 2318.68]  Okay.
[2318.72 --> 2321.56]  So it's more than a 10 banger, 10 bagger, bagger.
[2321.64 --> 2322.08]  That's the word.
[2322.20 --> 2324.52]  So it's like a 13 bagger or something like that.
[2324.54 --> 2328.00]  You 13 extra money over, uh, what was it?
[2328.62 --> 2328.88]  Let's see.
[2328.88 --> 2329.72]  When did they go IPO?
[2329.72 --> 2330.70]  So that was 2012.
[2330.92 --> 2331.62]  So about 12 years ago.
[2331.66 --> 2332.08]  Man, I'm good.
[2332.24 --> 2332.34]  Okay.
[2332.58 --> 2334.12]  Facebook was the king of the internet back then.
[2334.78 --> 2339.20]  They were, but it wasn't clear what their model for actually monetizing any of it was
[2339.20 --> 2339.72]  going to be.
[2339.86 --> 2340.70]  Oh yeah, but that never mattered.
[2341.28 --> 2341.62]  Okay.
[2341.74 --> 2342.14]  All right.
[2342.50 --> 2348.64]  But you don't see a path to Reddit becoming a bigger player in the advertising space or
[2348.64 --> 2350.46]  the AI space.
[2350.46 --> 2351.42]  The advertising space?
[2351.78 --> 2352.30]  No.
[2352.30 --> 2352.36]  No.
[2352.48 --> 2356.56]  As far as my understanding goes, advertising on Reddit, uh, is horrible and has always
[2356.56 --> 2357.04]  been horrible.
[2357.14 --> 2359.28]  What about the micro transaction space?
[2359.80 --> 2360.64]  I don't think so.
[2360.66 --> 2361.96]  I don't think anyone really cares.
[2362.42 --> 2365.12]  Um, they even like killed awards.
[2365.20 --> 2365.52]  Didn't they?
[2366.10 --> 2366.68]  I'm not sure.
[2366.88 --> 2367.30]  I don't know.
[2367.42 --> 2367.94]  I think so.
[2368.02 --> 2369.54]  I don't really use Reddit to be honest with you.
[2369.54 --> 2369.86]  Yeah.
[2369.92 --> 2370.20]  I don't know.
[2370.22 --> 2373.48]  Maybe there's some other new way to do it, but I think they removed the original way
[2373.48 --> 2375.18]  that you could like guild posts and stuff like that.
[2375.52 --> 2376.82]  Um, they might've replaced it.
[2376.86 --> 2377.42]  I might be wrong.
[2377.48 --> 2377.84]  I don't know.
[2377.96 --> 2378.88]  Don't take that as anything.
[2378.88 --> 2385.84]  Um, their only real value I can think of is selling their data.
[2386.36 --> 2390.94]  Um, which they're getting 60 million for it.
[2391.08 --> 2392.80]  Um, from one company.
[2392.92 --> 2394.64]  I don't know if that's exclusive.
[2394.64 --> 2398.80]  I was going to assume really, I sincerely doubt that that's exclusive.
[2398.80 --> 2404.34]  I mean, why would Sam Altman who owns, what was it like six point something percent of
[2404.34 --> 2404.80]  the company?
[2405.04 --> 2405.46]  8.7.
[2405.90 --> 2406.60]  Um, yeah.
[2406.66 --> 2408.78]  Why, why would he be like, you know, what would be cool?
[2409.06 --> 2411.14]  Not having this data, not having this data.
[2411.14 --> 2412.98]  I'm not going to advocate against this.
[2412.98 --> 2419.20]  Like, and if they took, even if they took half as much for access from Google, well,
[2419.20 --> 2420.26]  then they could sell it.
[2421.94 --> 2426.52]  Google, Microsoft, who would open AI just have them?
[2426.64 --> 2427.12]  Not necessarily.
[2427.28 --> 2430.80]  They could say, no, you have to buy two licenses, one for Microsoft, one for open AI.
[2430.96 --> 2433.14]  And then I mean, who the knows?
[2433.32 --> 2436.90]  Like maybe Yahoo still wants it because they want to be relevant again or something like
[2436.90 --> 2437.34]  Microsoft again.
[2437.50 --> 2437.90]  You could.
[2438.06 --> 2438.72]  Oh, that's right.
[2438.88 --> 2440.00]  You could definitely.
[2440.24 --> 2443.64]  The point is you could definitely turn around and sell it multiple times.
[2443.84 --> 2445.14]  And I'm selling it to Microsoft like six times.
[2445.28 --> 2445.42]  Yeah.
[2445.86 --> 2450.32]  And you know, you're a public company, so you're just going to do whatever is best for you.
[2450.40 --> 2451.10]  Ethics be damned.
[2451.10 --> 2459.16]  So you're probably going to sell it to, you know, like a crap.
[2459.16 --> 2460.20]  It's escaping me.
[2460.20 --> 2465.52]  The one that like Alibaba, you're probably going to sell it to, you know, Baidu.
[2465.52 --> 2466.90]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2466.90 --> 2472.06]  I absolutely, I absolutely think that scale up selling their data.
[2472.06 --> 2475.32]  Maybe they'll have some pretty good use.
[2475.32 --> 2478.48]  But there's a lot of the laws around that right now are kind of weird.
[2478.48 --> 2482.10]  And the concern for me is that that might already be priced in.
[2482.10 --> 2483.82]  Yeah.
[2484.82 --> 2486.14]  But I don't know that for sure.
[2486.56 --> 2488.10]  How much are they losing per year right now?
[2489.54 --> 2490.48]  That I don't know.
[2490.78 --> 2495.86]  I can tell you that they've been really pushy lately about us advertising on them.
[2495.86 --> 2500.30]  I don't think they really know who we are.
[2500.66 --> 2502.14]  It's like, oh, hold on one sec.
[2504.60 --> 2511.02]  Like I, we don't advertise Linus Tech Tips on Reddit.
[2511.24 --> 2515.24]  Well, we, I guess that might go to the wrong inbox, but we do advertise like certain creator
[2515.24 --> 2515.94]  warehouse things.
[2516.14 --> 2517.32]  No, it went to my inbox.
[2517.48 --> 2520.24]  And they're like, yeah, Linus Tech Tips is really cool.
[2520.62 --> 2522.14]  Brands have seen success in our program.
[2522.24 --> 2524.34]  We thought Linus Tech Tips could be a good fit.
[2524.46 --> 2525.24]  Heck yeah, dude.
[2525.24 --> 2530.90]  That you're missing out on an incremental engaged audience.
[2534.00 --> 2541.76]  Yeah, I, I guess that's neat, but like we don't, I mean, do you want, do you want to
[2541.76 --> 2542.70]  advertise with us?
[2543.68 --> 2544.88]  Who know reverse?
[2545.10 --> 2545.54]  Yeah, yeah.
[2546.00 --> 2547.58]  We can, we can sell your data.
[2549.62 --> 2551.02]  I don't know how to read this.
[2551.02 --> 2555.68]  I'm, I'm, I'm getting like headlines, but I'm not getting a lot of, uh, apparently they
[2555.68 --> 2560.42]  saw 21% revenue growth, uh, but $90 million in losses.
[2561.14 --> 2561.54]  Nice.
[2561.74 --> 2562.10]  Sick.
[2562.34 --> 2562.64]  Nice.
[2563.24 --> 2567.48]  I mean, you know, for, for Silicon Valley, that's pretty good, right?
[2567.50 --> 2567.98]  That's pretty good.
[2568.12 --> 2568.30]  Yeah.
[2568.36 --> 2568.60]  Yeah.
[2568.60 --> 2569.60]  Yeah.
[2570.16 --> 2570.52]  Yeah.
[2571.12 --> 2572.70]  Um, I don't know.
[2572.74 --> 2577.08]  I would be, I would have been pretty, what is, is bullish the right term on Facebook?
[2577.76 --> 2578.12]  Yeah.
[2578.26 --> 2579.00]  When it went IPO.
[2579.00 --> 2584.36]  I remember when that happened and I remember being like, don't have any money.
[2584.40 --> 2584.96]  Don't have any money.
[2585.04 --> 2585.26]  Yeah.
[2585.46 --> 2586.36]  Would have been sick though.
[2586.84 --> 2591.70]  Um, I don't feel the same way this time around.
[2593.18 --> 2603.28]  Um, I remember before Halo one came out, I, I like begged my grandpa to invest in Bungie
[2603.28 --> 2606.00]  without knowing that that wasn't like a thing you could do.
[2606.00 --> 2608.64]  Um, but I was like, this game's going to go bangers.
[2608.68 --> 2609.60]  I like, I know it.
[2610.30 --> 2614.32]  Um, I remember years later being like, oh man, I wish he like did that.
[2614.74 --> 2616.02]  He'd be like so wealthy now.
[2616.10 --> 2618.36]  And then I looked into it and I was like, yeah, it's not a thing you can do.
[2619.18 --> 2620.90]  Like, okay, cool.
[2622.02 --> 2622.70]  Oh man.
[2623.16 --> 2624.02]  Oh, Luke.
[2624.26 --> 2624.62]  Anyways.
[2624.96 --> 2625.62]  Uh, all right.
[2625.62 --> 2629.48]  I think it's time for us to do a couple of merch messages and explain what they are.
[2629.58 --> 2633.86]  They're the best way to interact with the show because instead of just throwing money
[2633.86 --> 2638.40]  at the screen, like you might do with other streamers, you get to throw money at the screen
[2638.40 --> 2641.90]  and also get great merchandise in your mailbox.
[2642.38 --> 2645.58]  We've got a couple of big announcements for the store this week.
[2645.80 --> 2649.28]  First, we have a backpack discount update.
[2649.62 --> 2656.54]  We have extended the expiry on our dual layer, uh, discount for backpack buyers prior to December
[2656.54 --> 2659.78]  9th to make sure that they can use it towards magnetic cable management.
[2659.78 --> 2662.90]  If they choose to, I had someone ask me about this.
[2662.96 --> 2666.76]  They were like, Hey, am I going to be able to use my credit for magnetic cable management?
[2666.76 --> 2668.14]  And I was like, yeah.
[2668.26 --> 2669.54]  And then the launch was delayed.
[2669.54 --> 2672.60]  And now we're like, yeah, still, yeah, still.
[2672.70 --> 2672.98]  Yeah.
[2672.98 --> 2674.50]  But it's going to be a little bit.
[2674.50 --> 2679.12]  So, uh, the expiry date has been moved to March 15th, which should give you some idea
[2679.12 --> 2682.14]  of when magnetic cable management is hopefully coming.
[2682.14 --> 2687.84]  Uh, we also have a backpack carabiner update source Reddit.
[2687.98 --> 2688.66]  This is hilarious.
[2689.74 --> 2692.48]  They are in people's hands.
[2692.68 --> 2693.76]  Check it out.
[2693.92 --> 2694.76]  This is it.
[2694.86 --> 2696.38]  This is the real deal.
[2696.66 --> 2702.12]  This is the kit that you will get with all your replacement bits and bobs.
[2702.24 --> 2707.66]  You get the tool for prying open the original, uh, pull holders.
[2707.66 --> 2711.98]  You get a set of regular pulls from YKK.
[2712.30 --> 2717.08]  So this is just in case you've had enough carabiner in your life and you just don't want any more
[2717.08 --> 2717.42]  of it.
[2718.54 --> 2722.80]  You get a full set of replacement carabiner pulls.
[2722.94 --> 2725.44]  These are in titanium alloy of some sort.
[2725.56 --> 2726.66]  They're super awesome.
[2727.12 --> 2728.68]  Uh, they don't have any hinges on them.
[2729.00 --> 2733.14]  They just, uh, we've shown them on the show before, but they basically just have these like
[2733.14 --> 2734.18]  cuts in either side.
[2734.18 --> 2737.92]  So they're really bendy at the right spot and they work like a carabiner would.
[2738.20 --> 2744.92]  And you get the custom designed, uh, from the creator warehouse team, a zipper closer,
[2744.92 --> 2746.18]  uh, tool.
[2746.28 --> 2749.18]  That is, I think, did we end up injection molding this?
[2749.26 --> 2749.98]  I don't remember.
[2750.06 --> 2752.30]  It's either 3d printed or injection molded, but it's plastic.
[2752.30 --> 2756.20]  And you basically turn the thing in order to close it shut.
[2756.28 --> 2761.44]  I believe Tynan hosted the video that you will scan this QR code to view and it shows
[2761.44 --> 2763.44]  you exactly how to replace them all.
[2763.50 --> 2768.40]  The whole process should take less than like 10 minutes to get all the old ones off and
[2768.40 --> 2769.40]  all the new ones on.
[2769.56 --> 2771.18]  Now, this is really important.
[2771.32 --> 2772.60]  I cannot stress this enough.
[2772.60 --> 2782.46]  You are to use either these or these one time, just one time.
[2782.68 --> 2783.58]  Don't swap back and forth.
[2783.70 --> 2787.98]  These are not for, you know, Oh, you know, I'm really in a carabiner mood today.
[2788.14 --> 2789.26]  Uh, or no, you know what?
[2789.26 --> 2793.58]  I'm really feeling the more basic pole look one time.
[2794.20 --> 2798.02]  If you open them and close them and open them and close them and replace the poles more
[2798.02 --> 2803.84]  than you have to, it will cause the metal to fatigue and it will cause it to break.
[2804.24 --> 2810.76]  So one time, um, don't tell me what to do.
[2811.60 --> 2813.26]  I'm telling you what we'll cover.
[2814.02 --> 2815.66]  So that's what I'm telling you.
[2815.98 --> 2817.18]  Trust me, bro.
[2817.54 --> 2818.76]  Do it one time.
[2819.26 --> 2826.32]  Uh, the last thing for us to shout out this week for the store is that we have stock of
[2826.32 --> 2831.26]  the legendary Honeywell PTM 7950 thermal pads.
[2831.50 --> 2832.16]  These are sweet.
[2832.60 --> 2833.98]  Uh, they really are.
[2834.14 --> 2842.88]  This has been a long time coming as it turns out, um, Honeywell, not a super easy company
[2842.88 --> 2846.02]  for randoms like me to get in touch with.
[2846.02 --> 2854.34]  And we were, but we were able to get in touch with someone who was a viewer slash fan and
[2854.34 --> 2862.02]  had a contact at a distributor for Honeywell and was able to get us access to their PTM 7950,
[2862.02 --> 2864.30]  which we actually reviewed.
[2864.30 --> 2865.84]  There we go.
[2866.32 --> 2867.68]  Reddit told me to buy this man.
[2867.74 --> 2869.78]  The whole show is like Reddit themed today.
[2869.84 --> 2870.30]  Reddit, Reddit, Reddit.
[2870.44 --> 2872.54]  About a year and a half ago.
[2872.86 --> 2875.18]  Long story short, it's really cool.
[2875.56 --> 2878.32]  You put it in the fridge, which solidifies it.
[2878.32 --> 2880.60]  You cut it in the shape that you want.
[2880.86 --> 2883.50]  You peel the, the, the backings off of it.
[2883.64 --> 2885.58]  You put it, well, you peel one side.
[2885.70 --> 2889.50]  You put it onto whatever it is you're trying to cool, CPU, GPU, or whatever the case may
[2889.50 --> 2889.58]  be.
[2889.64 --> 2891.84]  You peel the other plastic off of it.
[2891.84 --> 2896.82]  And then what happens is once you mount your heat sink or your, well, yeah, heat sink or
[2896.82 --> 2903.46]  water block or whatever it is, and it warms up, it changes phases, allowing you to have
[2903.46 --> 2906.02]  a perfect mount every time.
[2906.10 --> 2909.76]  There's no inconsistency like you might encounter sometimes with thermal paste.
[2909.76 --> 2912.80]  So yeah, super cool.
[2913.06 --> 2916.08]  And you can buy this stuff in other places.
[2916.08 --> 2917.40]  It's absolutely a thing.
[2917.52 --> 2924.68]  But in most cases that we've seen, it is either extremely expensive or it comes from sources
[2924.68 --> 2929.76]  where you have no guarantee whatsoever that the sheet of gray schmoo that you're buying
[2929.76 --> 2938.36]  is actually PTM 7950 because Honeywell doesn't engage with little piddly, you know, computer
[2938.36 --> 2938.80]  sellers.
[2938.80 --> 2939.90]  They're not interested.
[2940.52 --> 2944.96]  If you're not, if you're not a government entity, they're basically not picking up the
[2944.96 --> 2945.22]  phone.
[2945.28 --> 2947.82]  And that's, that's not a fair characterization entirely.
[2947.82 --> 2951.32]  But the point is that they're only really interested in very big fish.
[2951.42 --> 2953.00]  Now it is still not cheap.
[2953.30 --> 2959.20]  You can see here a six centimeter, yeah, six centimeter by six centimeter pad is $14.99.
[2959.54 --> 2968.02]  But we also offer a 200 mil by 160 mil for, wait, where'd the price go?
[2968.02 --> 2968.70]  Ah, yes.
[2968.82 --> 2970.40]  For $69.99.
[2970.74 --> 2973.32]  So that would give you a lot of uses.
[2974.46 --> 2976.26]  Let's see if we can, oh no, did we not?
[2976.42 --> 2978.22]  Oh, please tell me we have pictures for scale.
[2978.90 --> 2979.16]  Okay.
[2979.22 --> 2980.34]  Here's the two for scale.
[2980.68 --> 2981.30]  Oh no.
[2981.68 --> 2984.50]  Do we, do we have, do we have any of the next two CPU?
[2984.50 --> 2985.02]  Okay.
[2985.22 --> 2985.78]  Well, whatever.
[2985.92 --> 2989.10]  Six centimeters is pretty big and 20.
[2989.18 --> 2989.34]  Okay.
[2989.40 --> 2990.08]  So that's 27.
[2990.22 --> 2990.58]  So, okay.
[2990.70 --> 2995.20]  So here for my American friends, that's about two thirds.
[2995.72 --> 2996.78]  You like fractions, right?
[2996.88 --> 3000.10]  Two thirds of a 12 inch ruler ish, ish.
[3000.10 --> 3002.62]  Uh, by about half of a 12 inch ruler.
[3002.88 --> 3003.34]  There you go.
[3003.44 --> 3004.30]  So that's, that's pretty big.
[3004.34 --> 3005.62]  That's quite a few applications.
[3007.32 --> 3008.46]  Uh, is it reusable?
[3009.24 --> 3009.60]  No.
[3010.08 --> 3011.10]  It changes phases.
[3011.38 --> 3014.72]  So it, it is definitely something you would want to clean off after you're done.
[3016.78 --> 3018.32]  Anyway, really cool product.
[3018.54 --> 3019.38]  Really good performance.
[3019.70 --> 3021.98]  Not like your grandma's thermal pad.
[3021.98 --> 3025.30]  What?
[3026.02 --> 3026.38]  Nothing.
[3028.18 --> 3029.46]  Anyway, merch messages.
[3029.62 --> 3033.44]  All you got to do is go to ltdstore.com and in the cart, there'll be a little box.
[3033.58 --> 3037.24]  Whenever we're live, you can fill out a merch message and it'll go to producer Dan, who
[3037.24 --> 3041.26]  will reply to your message, forward it to the appropriate person or curate it for me
[3041.26 --> 3043.14]  and Luke to address on the show.
[3043.24 --> 3046.52]  So Dan, why don't you go ahead and hit us with a couple of merch messages?
[3046.70 --> 3047.32]  Sure, can do.
[3047.68 --> 3048.42]  Hi, LLD.
[3048.86 --> 3051.34]  Luke, how does having birds limit your life?
[3051.34 --> 3052.78]  What do you do when you go on holiday?
[3053.00 --> 3054.86]  Is it more difficult than having a cat?
[3055.20 --> 3056.50]  Love all animals.
[3057.32 --> 3058.36]  Yeah, it can be kind of annoying.
[3059.04 --> 3060.16]  Um, birds are super fragile.
[3060.50 --> 3062.70]  So there's a lot of things like in the air.
[3063.42 --> 3071.24]  Um, like if someone cooks with, um, like nonstick pans and stuff, it can, it can put things
[3071.24 --> 3073.14]  in the air that can kill the birds.
[3073.26 --> 3076.70]  There's other different cleaners and things they might use around their house and whatnot
[3076.70 --> 3078.64]  that can be really bad for the birds.
[3078.64 --> 3080.50]  It's a lot of stuff that would be in the air.
[3080.50 --> 3083.26]  Um, there's even like air fresheners in your car.
[3083.44 --> 3086.30]  So having someone else drive them around can even be a problem.
[3087.00 --> 3090.84]  Um, so when a full plane chat just said, how do friends bird die from resin 3d printer
[3090.84 --> 3091.20]  fumes?
[3091.32 --> 3091.50]  Yeah.
[3091.54 --> 3092.14]  Not surprised.
[3092.32 --> 3093.06]  Not surprised at all.
[3093.76 --> 3108.00]  Um, it's for us, there is a local bird vet, uh, avian vet, avian vet, avian vet.
[3108.00 --> 3108.70]  Is that what it's called?
[3108.78 --> 3109.22]  I think so.
[3109.34 --> 3109.52]  Sure.
[3109.82 --> 3111.20]  Um, and they do boarding.
[3111.66 --> 3113.62]  So when we go away, we can leave them.
[3113.68 --> 3114.62]  Hopefully not with water.
[3117.82 --> 3118.60]  That's for fish.
[3119.56 --> 3119.88]  Yeah.
[3119.94 --> 3120.42]  There you go.
[3120.88 --> 3121.24]  Yeah.
[3121.24 --> 3124.92]  Come on down to Luke's waterboarding.
[3125.26 --> 3126.36]  Leave your fish with us.
[3126.56 --> 3128.32]  We'll make sure they get the finest care.
[3129.00 --> 3130.04]  So concerning.
[3130.38 --> 3131.56]  So many red flags.
[3132.14 --> 3136.00]  Um, but yeah, you can leave them at the vet, which, uh, is also nice because then you can
[3136.00 --> 3138.14]  get checkups and other stuff done while you're gone.
[3138.28 --> 3139.48]  So, yeah.
[3139.48 --> 3139.88]  Yeah.
[3141.34 --> 3141.70]  Yeah.
[3142.18 --> 3142.90]  Now the one I got here.
[3143.24 --> 3148.72]  Hi, Wanda DLO with new AI processing and editing features in smartphone cameras.
[3148.84 --> 3150.36]  What is a picture anymore?
[3150.70 --> 3152.78]  How much processing is too much?
[3152.88 --> 3153.60]  Where's the line?
[3153.70 --> 3159.52]  I mean, this is kind of an older controversy now, but, uh, I was about to clear it.
[3160.00 --> 3160.18]  Yeah.
[3160.54 --> 3162.76]  Uh, it's a space station.
[3162.96 --> 3163.78]  It's not a moon.
[3163.78 --> 3167.46]  The point is, sorry, I'm layering up the Star Wars references here.
[3167.46 --> 3167.78]  It's pretty good.
[3168.00 --> 3169.40]  It's a lot of them, but I liked it.
[3169.64 --> 3169.80]  Yeah.
[3171.28 --> 3171.80]  I don't know.
[3172.84 --> 3173.24]  Yeah.
[3173.30 --> 3174.56]  I was trying really hard for this one.
[3174.58 --> 3176.76]  I'm a little ray of Star Wars sunshine.
[3178.08 --> 3178.48]  Wow.
[3178.62 --> 3178.82]  Yeah.
[3179.02 --> 3179.22]  Yeah.
[3179.26 --> 3180.68]  I don't think that one landed very well.
[3180.78 --> 3181.84]  No, I really didn't.
[3181.88 --> 3182.62]  Just like the movies.
[3182.92 --> 3183.02]  Yeah.
[3183.14 --> 3183.36]  Po!
[3184.28 --> 3186.32]  Like dough, but it doesn't matter.
[3186.92 --> 3187.28]  Um.
[3191.18 --> 3192.00]  Oh my goodness.
[3192.20 --> 3192.64]  Anyway.
[3192.90 --> 3193.24]  Yes.
[3193.24 --> 3198.10]  The Samsung moon photos where people were taking pictures of the moon through their Samsung
[3198.10 --> 3208.02]  telephoto, you know, magnified AI zoom nonsense and didn't realize how, how trained the model
[3208.02 --> 3215.34]  was to basically take their picture and use it as kind of a hint for a much more detailed
[3215.34 --> 3220.26]  scan of our picture of the moon that it was just kind of plonking into people's pictures.
[3220.26 --> 3220.48]  Wow.
[3220.54 --> 3222.00]  Gee, look how perfect the moon looks.
[3222.00 --> 3223.66]  And everyone's pictures on Samsung phones.
[3227.44 --> 3229.12]  What even is a picture anymore?
[3229.70 --> 3231.02]  What even is truth anymore?
[3231.02 --> 3231.70]  How about this?
[3232.70 --> 3234.08]  What was a picture ever?
[3234.08 --> 3240.66]  What if your picture from, you know, 1951 was edited?
[3240.66 --> 3248.98]  That wasn't in color and was grainy as heck and had, you know, contrast and clarity issues.
[3248.98 --> 3249.56]  Like, okay.
[3249.96 --> 3254.58]  Uh, one of the, one of the big problems with earlier cameras was the way that they handled
[3254.58 --> 3259.26]  darker skin tones because they were designed by whites for whites.
[3259.26 --> 3261.74]  Um, I didn't know about this.
[3261.84 --> 3262.22]  Makes sense.
[3262.26 --> 3262.40]  Yeah.
[3262.50 --> 3264.14]  It's no, it's like, it's like a whole thing.
[3264.22 --> 3270.50]  It's like, it's anyway, modern camera technology and lighting technology has caught up a lot
[3270.50 --> 3271.86]  to the point where you can.
[3272.32 --> 3272.50]  What?
[3272.50 --> 3275.04]  Oh, you are bleeding.
[3275.56 --> 3276.56]  When did that even happen?
[3277.42 --> 3279.64]  Um, please don't get blood on the table.
[3280.78 --> 3281.52]  Really, Dan?
[3281.68 --> 3283.44]  I'll get some towels to clean it off.
[3283.56 --> 3284.34]  Um, okay.
[3284.44 --> 3284.82]  Is it new?
[3284.90 --> 3285.42]  Does it look new?
[3285.50 --> 3286.14]  Yeah, it looks new.
[3286.38 --> 3286.54]  What?
[3287.58 --> 3288.48]  It's new blood.
[3289.04 --> 3289.40]  Um.
[3289.70 --> 3290.46]  Well, I'm fine.
[3290.56 --> 3290.86]  Fun fact.
[3290.86 --> 3292.26]  I'll just try to not bleed on things.
[3292.26 --> 3293.56]  That's the Twilight reboot.
[3294.10 --> 3294.50]  Nice.
[3294.72 --> 3294.88]  Yeah.
[3295.76 --> 3296.52]  Very good.
[3296.56 --> 3296.96]  Anywho.
[3297.14 --> 3297.62]  Very good.
[3297.84 --> 3298.92]  The point is.
[3299.22 --> 3299.54]  Sure.
[3299.88 --> 3300.84]  A really paper towel.
[3301.48 --> 3304.30]  I mean, you're getting him the form, right?
[3304.44 --> 3306.66]  We should make him fill out the form on my show.
[3306.68 --> 3306.96]  Are you serious?
[3307.20 --> 3307.60]  Yes.
[3307.62 --> 3309.60]  If you cut yourself at work, you have to fill out the form.
[3309.62 --> 3310.60]  Maybe it wasn't at work.
[3312.30 --> 3313.96]  I just told you it looks fresh.
[3315.18 --> 3316.38]  They witnessed it.
[3316.88 --> 3318.16]  How did that even happen?
[3318.16 --> 3319.50]  Do you know how much they witnessed you?
[3319.50 --> 3322.14]  Enough that you have to spray your mouth full of silver spray paint.
[3322.14 --> 3322.56]  Why is it?
[3322.60 --> 3324.08]  All these references.
[3326.74 --> 3328.32]  Look, it's been a long week, okay?
[3328.46 --> 3329.14]  What's happening?
[3329.34 --> 3330.36]  It's not even...
[3330.36 --> 3331.36]  I don't think it's fresh.
[3331.54 --> 3332.14]  Oh, man.
[3332.26 --> 3332.78]  Oh, man.
[3332.80 --> 3333.60]  This is great.
[3334.56 --> 3338.56]  Never injure yourself live on the internet because you are going to have...
[3338.56 --> 3342.18]  You're going to immediately turn into a hypochondriac because you're going to have literally
[3342.18 --> 3348.98]  10,000 people looking up all the horrible, awful things that could cause a spontaneous skin
[3348.98 --> 3351.32]  lesion or that could infect your blood.
[3351.54 --> 3351.78]  Yeah.
[3351.92 --> 3352.70]  They're going to have to...
[3352.70 --> 3354.86]  They're going to have to cut it off above the elbow loop.
[3354.88 --> 3355.04]  It's gone.
[3355.38 --> 3355.82]  Yeah.
[3356.00 --> 3356.56]  It's over.
[3357.48 --> 3358.10]  My whole career.
[3358.28 --> 3359.54]  Oh, my goodness, you guys.
[3359.64 --> 3360.40]  Could be a tick.
[3360.60 --> 3360.74]  Yeah.
[3360.80 --> 3361.24]  Could be...
[3361.24 --> 3362.16]  Could be lupus.
[3362.42 --> 3363.50]  Could be a...
[3363.50 --> 3364.26]  Oh, man.
[3364.38 --> 3365.46]  Might as well just amputate it now.
[3365.90 --> 3366.62]  We don't even have time to get the hospital.
[3366.62 --> 3368.48]  Speedrun workplace safety for many percent.
[3368.60 --> 3369.02]  Let's go.
[3369.30 --> 3370.00]  Oh, my goodness.
[3370.00 --> 3371.96]  It was a pre-existing condition.
[3372.08 --> 3373.56]  He scratched a scab LMAO.
[3373.94 --> 3375.02]  Did you have a scab there?
[3375.08 --> 3375.78]  I don't think so.
[3375.88 --> 3376.14]  All right.
[3376.20 --> 3377.02]  Well, I mean...
[3377.02 --> 3377.44]  How big...
[3377.44 --> 3378.70]  Like, I can't even really see it.
[3379.24 --> 3381.52]  It's either that or...
[3381.52 --> 3382.62]  It's not very big.
[3382.68 --> 3383.52]  What's this other good one?
[3383.58 --> 3384.46]  I can't feel it either.
[3384.58 --> 3385.84]  I feel like this happens some other time.
[3385.92 --> 3386.20]  Oh, no.
[3386.30 --> 3386.60]  Tynan.
[3386.76 --> 3387.62]  No, look away.
[3388.28 --> 3388.96]  Oh, no.
[3389.88 --> 3390.16]  Oh, yeah.
[3390.22 --> 3391.76]  Tynan's not going to let you get away with it.
[3391.76 --> 3392.70]  Safety man is here.
[3392.86 --> 3394.34]  Sudden death syndrome.
[3394.34 --> 3397.88]  He's not an infant, okay?
[3399.14 --> 3400.06]  It's not like...
[3400.06 --> 3401.88]  I don't believe you that it's new.
[3402.38 --> 3403.48]  I can tell from the color.
[3404.12 --> 3405.46]  Look at the color of those pixels.
[3406.74 --> 3407.30]  It's...
[3407.30 --> 3408.34]  I mean, yeah.
[3408.96 --> 3409.32]  Ish.
[3409.90 --> 3411.12]  And there's no blood here.
[3411.32 --> 3411.82]  Here, give me that.
[3413.94 --> 3414.88]  It's not dry.
[3415.28 --> 3417.00]  There's literally blood spots on here.
[3417.04 --> 3417.88]  What are you even talking about?
[3417.88 --> 3419.52]  There's like little flecks.
[3419.60 --> 3421.72]  I think that's dried blood that got off.
[3421.74 --> 3422.58]  It's not.
[3422.70 --> 3424.28]  You can tell from the color, Luke.
[3424.34 --> 3425.30]  I tried to pull it off.
[3425.36 --> 3426.16]  Yeah, what?
[3426.22 --> 3427.44]  You think I'm a fucking idiot?
[3427.70 --> 3429.98]  Like, you've known me a long time.
[3430.34 --> 3431.12]  I'm still going to try.
[3431.34 --> 3432.26]  It's just about to scratch.
[3432.80 --> 3433.94]  It's merely a flesh wound.
[3434.60 --> 3435.64]  I mean, it is a flesh wound.
[3435.72 --> 3436.52]  Sure, give you that.
[3436.62 --> 3437.12]  But it's...
[3437.12 --> 3438.04]  It wasn't a pimple.
[3438.12 --> 3439.32]  It's like a big spot.
[3439.44 --> 3440.46]  It's not a dry one.
[3441.20 --> 3442.58]  Stop showing everyone your blood.
[3442.70 --> 3443.02]  Gross.
[3443.16 --> 3444.12]  I'm trying to see it myself.
[3444.20 --> 3444.56]  Nice.
[3444.56 --> 3445.28]  Oh, my goodness.
[3445.38 --> 3446.32]  Luke fills out the form.
[3446.48 --> 3447.48]  Live on the air.
[3447.58 --> 3448.52]  Let's go, Dan.
[3449.68 --> 3450.80]  Well, you have to give it to me.
[3450.80 --> 3452.04]  Yeah, Luke has to fill out the form.
[3452.06 --> 3452.44]  Oh, no.
[3452.44 --> 3454.62]  Technically, that's proprietary information.
[3454.78 --> 3455.72]  It is not.
[3455.98 --> 3457.52]  It's protected medical information.
[3457.68 --> 3460.74]  And you've told everybody on the internet that he's had a medical incident.
[3461.10 --> 3462.44]  And now he can...
[3463.08 --> 3465.02]  I think technically I told everyone.
[3465.48 --> 3465.68]  Oh.
[3465.90 --> 3466.14]  Yeah.
[3466.26 --> 3466.64]  Oh, good.
[3466.96 --> 3467.18]  Okay.
[3467.34 --> 3467.70]  Yes.
[3467.82 --> 3469.90]  So, Luke, you can only sue yourself.
[3470.00 --> 3471.40]  The company lives another day.
[3471.40 --> 3472.34]  I'm going to do it.
[3472.34 --> 3475.36]  I'm not a member of the safety committee, so I actually can't fill this out.
[3475.48 --> 3477.66]  But we have an AED upstairs if you need it.
[3478.02 --> 3478.86]  Yes, that is...
[3478.86 --> 3482.68]  I was going to bring it for comedy, but I figured that was probably actually kind of irresponsible.
[3482.98 --> 3483.58]  Yeah, please don't do that.
[3483.58 --> 3483.66]  Yeah.
[3484.50 --> 3484.86]  Exactly.
[3485.04 --> 3488.48]  It's like playing with fire extinguishers at work, which we have never done.
[3489.50 --> 3489.86]  Allegedly.
[3490.48 --> 3492.08]  I actually don't think we have.
[3492.08 --> 3492.54]  I don't think so.
[3492.62 --> 3494.10]  I was trying to think back in the old house.
[3494.22 --> 3495.94]  I was like, that seems very possible back then.
[3495.98 --> 3496.90]  I don't think we have.
[3496.92 --> 3497.74]  But I don't think we did.
[3497.82 --> 3497.98]  Yeah.
[3498.58 --> 3498.84]  Yeah.
[3500.24 --> 3501.32]  I brought you a Band-Aid, though.
[3501.32 --> 3501.94]  Do you want a Band-Aid?
[3502.52 --> 3502.84]  Sure.
[3503.08 --> 3504.18]  Just so I don't get blood on anything.
[3504.36 --> 3505.00]  Okay, so...
[3505.00 --> 3505.98]  I still don't feel it.
[3506.04 --> 3508.16]  Back to our conversation about cameras.
[3508.16 --> 3509.60]  So, my question is...
[3509.60 --> 3509.66]  Yeah.
[3509.90 --> 3517.18]  Is that photo that you took in 1951 real, or are there all kinds of approximations and
[3517.18 --> 3523.22]  flaws in that representation that we only accept because we are used to them?
[3523.22 --> 3530.18]  I think by that logic, yeah, no recreation of anything ever could be real.
[3530.60 --> 3531.18]  So then...
[3531.18 --> 3537.04]  But I do think that intentionally changing something...
[3537.04 --> 3539.06]  We intentionally change things all the time.
[3539.16 --> 3539.98]  What's a color filter?
[3540.92 --> 3541.46]  I mean, yeah.
[3541.60 --> 3542.44]  I include that.
[3542.52 --> 3543.12]  Oh, okay.
[3543.18 --> 3543.64]  So then fine.
[3543.70 --> 3543.96]  Go ahead.
[3544.12 --> 3544.52]  But is that...
[3544.52 --> 3545.42]  So is that...
[3545.42 --> 3546.94]  Changing something through editing.
[3547.48 --> 3549.96]  Because the question is, what is a picture anymore?
[3549.96 --> 3555.34]  I guess my counter question is, what was a picture ever?
[3555.34 --> 3558.54]  If you've been on Instagram, what has a picture been this whole time?
[3558.96 --> 3562.48]  Because people are, you know, you can see people that are trying to, yeah, shrink their
[3562.48 --> 3564.46]  waist or make their arms look big or whatever.
[3564.82 --> 3565.40]  And you'll see...
[3565.40 --> 3565.54]  Yep.
[3565.64 --> 3566.32]  Oh, I meant pecs.
[3566.40 --> 3566.98]  I meant pecs.
[3567.24 --> 3568.24]  Both, to be honest.
[3568.34 --> 3568.48]  Sure.
[3568.84 --> 3571.42]  And you'll see, like, the background behind them, like, warp.
[3571.84 --> 3571.94]  Yeah.
[3571.94 --> 3575.06]  Because they've, like, expanded or contracted something.
[3575.42 --> 3576.18]  Oh, my goodness.
[3576.38 --> 3577.96]  Speaking of contracting something...
[3577.96 --> 3586.36]  Oh, my gosh.
[3587.14 --> 3588.14]  Oh, this was all planned.
[3588.86 --> 3590.66]  Oh, no way.
[3591.56 --> 3591.88]  Really?
[3592.18 --> 3593.24]  Is this what I think it is?
[3593.28 --> 3594.36]  Are you allowed to show this off?
[3594.40 --> 3595.20]  I might have it.
[3595.46 --> 3595.80]  You better.
[3596.10 --> 3597.30]  Yeah, are you allowed to show it off?
[3597.42 --> 3598.00]  I don't know.
[3598.10 --> 3599.74]  I'll go to CW and help you leak it.
[3600.02 --> 3600.88]  Tynan, is he allowed?
[3601.88 --> 3603.14]  I feel like Tynan would know.
[3605.64 --> 3605.96]  I don't know.
[3605.96 --> 3606.44]  I don't know.
[3606.44 --> 3606.96]  I don't know.
[3607.96 --> 3608.36]  Please.
[3608.52 --> 3608.90]  It's not.
[3610.00 --> 3611.26]  Dang it, I don't have it.
[3611.62 --> 3612.68]  I can go to CW and...
[3612.68 --> 3613.54]  No, it's okay.
[3614.46 --> 3615.14]  It's okay.
[3616.60 --> 3617.70]  Oh, that sucks.
[3619.46 --> 3621.22]  Wait, is Tynan actually saying that?
[3621.26 --> 3621.40]  No.
[3621.60 --> 3621.86]  Okay.
[3622.04 --> 3622.98]  No, no, he's not.
[3623.12 --> 3627.98]  I wanted to leak the fail pen, which I think we've actually talked about before.
[3628.20 --> 3628.98]  Oh, we've talked about it.
[3628.98 --> 3630.28]  Yeah, we do have a pen.
[3630.28 --> 3630.88]  I can't see.
[3630.96 --> 3631.70]  Can you put it on?
[3631.76 --> 3632.34]  I can't see.
[3632.34 --> 3632.66]  Oh, my God.
[3632.76 --> 3633.60]  This is sad.
[3634.64 --> 3635.56]  What was that?
[3635.56 --> 3639.34]  That was you not letting go when you tried to hand me something.
[3641.28 --> 3641.56]  Yeah.
[3642.06 --> 3642.66]  Deggs.
[3642.66 --> 3643.64]  There you go.
[3643.90 --> 3644.78]  There you go.
[3644.96 --> 3648.92]  It feels better now.
[3649.60 --> 3651.90]  Oh, my goodness.
[3652.00 --> 3652.74]  It's because I'm a father.
[3652.96 --> 3653.58]  Daddy kisses.
[3654.08 --> 3654.58]  He'll everything.
[3654.58 --> 3656.66]  Okay
[3656.66 --> 3659.52]  Alright
[3659.52 --> 3660.42]  I'll do this right
[3660.42 --> 3661.84]  Oh calm down you guys
[3661.84 --> 3662.98]  I kissed the bandaid
[3662.98 --> 3664.88]  I don't care either way
[3664.88 --> 3667.54]  And he knew that
[3667.54 --> 3672.48]  This is gonna end up on the subreddit
[3672.48 --> 3673.54]  Before the night is out
[3673.54 --> 3674.04]  Oh yeah
[3674.04 --> 3676.56]  And it's gonna explode
[3676.56 --> 3677.74]  It's gonna break the internet
[3677.74 --> 3679.14]  Better invest in reddit
[3679.14 --> 3679.50]  Wait
[3679.50 --> 3682.86]  Not yet
[3682.86 --> 3686.04]  What are we supposed to be talking about right now?
[3686.52 --> 3687.58]  Right are they pictures?
[3687.82 --> 3688.32]  Right are you
[3688.32 --> 3689.82]  No you're just filling out forms
[3689.82 --> 3690.26]  Okay well
[3690.26 --> 3690.44]  I am
[3690.44 --> 3691.60]  No I think
[3691.60 --> 3692.30]  Yeah I think
[3692.30 --> 3696.34]  Some camera nerds are gonna come back at me
[3696.34 --> 3697.40]  With like certain cameras
[3697.40 --> 3698.82]  Are gonna naturally look different
[3698.82 --> 3699.54]  In a certain way
[3699.54 --> 3700.22]  Compared to other ones
[3700.22 --> 3700.70]  Or bokeh
[3700.70 --> 3702.16]  I think if you go in
[3702.16 --> 3702.94]  Or even framing
[3702.94 --> 3704.84]  Even the way you frame a picture
[3704.84 --> 3707.38]  Can change the context dramatically
[3707.38 --> 3708.36]  Intensely yeah
[3708.36 --> 3708.84]  Yeah
[3708.84 --> 3709.68]  Yeah
[3709.68 --> 3711.56]  I think we're getting to a
[3711.56 --> 3712.68]  New
[3712.68 --> 3717.48]  Man there's a movie reference here
[3717.48 --> 3718.58]  We don't remember the exact naming
[3718.58 --> 3719.84]  But we're getting to like
[3719.84 --> 3721.90]  New ground here
[3721.90 --> 3723.74]  Untread paths
[3723.74 --> 3724.52]  Sure
[3724.52 --> 3725.74]  Where having
[3725.74 --> 3728.06]  Things that aren't even like
[3728.06 --> 3729.10]  We're not even necessarily
[3729.10 --> 3730.14]  Tuning these dials
[3730.14 --> 3731.22]  Like with the Samsung thing
[3731.22 --> 3733.02]  It's just doing that automatically
[3733.02 --> 3734.18]  It's changing the picture
[3734.18 --> 3736.74]  That's
[3736.74 --> 3737.50]  Uncharted waters
[3737.50 --> 3738.18]  There we go
[3738.18 --> 3739.68]  Strange new worlds
[3739.68 --> 3741.24]  Yeah there's a lot of different references
[3741.24 --> 3741.70]  This could be
[3741.70 --> 3743.80]  But I do think this is
[3743.80 --> 3745.02]  New
[3745.02 --> 3746.70]  And different
[3746.70 --> 3748.20]  And in a way
[3748.20 --> 3748.94]  Scary
[3748.94 --> 3751.72]  Because I think it's kind of less obvious
[3751.72 --> 3754.82]  I think there's a lot of ways
[3754.82 --> 3755.66]  Like what we were talking about
[3755.66 --> 3756.86]  With the like bent backgrounds
[3756.86 --> 3757.22]  And stuff
[3757.22 --> 3758.02]  There's quite a few ways
[3758.02 --> 3758.64]  That you can tell
[3758.64 --> 3760.18]  If something was edited in the past
[3760.18 --> 3761.24]  This is gonna be
[3761.24 --> 3761.90]  I think that's gonna be harder
[3761.90 --> 3762.56]  A lot harder
[3762.56 --> 3763.34]  Yep
[3763.34 --> 3765.14]  Time of injury
[3765.14 --> 3768.40]  I mean we could check the time stamp
[3768.40 --> 3769.56]  I bet someone knows
[3769.56 --> 3769.92]  PM
[3769.92 --> 3771.04]  I have no idea
[3771.04 --> 3772.40]  How specific does it have to be?
[3772.94 --> 3773.42]  Yeah
[3773.42 --> 3774.30]  I mean
[3774.30 --> 3776.72]  Very accurate
[3776.72 --> 3777.38]  Yes
[3777.38 --> 3779.22]  I filled out a form for my injury
[3779.22 --> 3779.82]  The other day
[3779.82 --> 3781.04]  During the shoot
[3781.04 --> 3784.38]  My cut was two millimeters long
[3784.38 --> 3786.92]  I believe I caught a hangnail
[3786.92 --> 3787.80]  On my pants
[3787.80 --> 3788.16]  And
[3788.16 --> 3790.32]  Really?
[3790.48 --> 3791.24]  Is that what it was?
[3791.34 --> 3791.72]  I think so
[3791.72 --> 3793.90]  Because you were standing next to
[3793.90 --> 3796.48]  A recently metal framed thing
[3796.48 --> 3797.18]  I just assumed
[3797.18 --> 3797.58]  Me too
[3797.58 --> 3798.72]  You touched a sharp object
[3798.72 --> 3799.20]  Or something
[3799.20 --> 3799.48]  No
[3799.48 --> 3800.34]  It was definitely
[3800.34 --> 3802.40]  Pants ripping my fingers open
[3802.40 --> 3804.04]  That was a fun shoot though
[3804.04 --> 3805.20]  Maybe we should talk about that
[3805.20 --> 3805.84]  A little bit
[3805.84 --> 3807.34]  Let's do
[3807.34 --> 3808.12]  Let's do our
[3808.12 --> 3808.80]  Oh no
[3808.80 --> 3808.94]  Yeah
[3808.94 --> 3809.64]  We've got topics
[3809.64 --> 3809.92]  Okay
[3809.92 --> 3810.78]  We get to do topics
[3810.78 --> 3812.32]  So Luke wasn't there
[3812.32 --> 3813.64]  I kind of feel bad
[3813.64 --> 3814.92]  For not inviting you
[3814.92 --> 3815.68]  To what?
[3815.84 --> 3817.84]  You probably would have wanted to come
[3817.84 --> 3819.42]  The full projector wall thing?
[3819.52 --> 3820.72]  The world's
[3820.72 --> 3822.60]  Largest gaming displays
[3822.60 --> 3824.38]  Do you know the Weird Al song?
[3827.08 --> 3827.90]  Which one?
[3828.40 --> 3830.00]  Frank's 2000 inch TV
[3830.00 --> 3831.96]  I don't think so
[3831.96 --> 3832.98]  Hold on
[3832.98 --> 3833.68]  It sounds awesome
[3833.68 --> 3836.04]  Does it have a music video?
[3836.18 --> 3836.66]  I actually
[3836.66 --> 3838.10]  I actually don't know
[3838.10 --> 3839.50]  If this has a music video
[3839.50 --> 3841.50]  It would appear that
[3841.50 --> 3842.86]  It does not
[3842.86 --> 3844.20]  But it's
[3844.20 --> 3845.52]  It's a Weird Al song
[3845.52 --> 3846.08]  From
[3846.08 --> 3847.44]  I want to say
[3847.44 --> 3848.70]  The late 90s
[3848.70 --> 3849.78]  Or something like that
[3849.78 --> 3856.30]  Anyway
[3856.30 --> 3857.58]  The point is that
[3857.58 --> 3858.58]  He sings this song
[3858.58 --> 3858.94]  About
[3858.94 --> 3859.34]  You know
[3859.34 --> 3861.28]  Kind of poking fun
[3861.28 --> 3863.24]  At keeping up with the Joneses
[3863.24 --> 3863.66]  And
[3863.66 --> 3866.34]  And flaunting your wealth
[3866.34 --> 3867.92]  Through fancy electronics
[3867.92 --> 3868.88]  And it's sort of
[3868.88 --> 3869.18]  This
[3869.18 --> 3870.44]  This guy who buys
[3870.44 --> 3871.72]  This end game TV
[3871.72 --> 3872.48]  That can
[3872.48 --> 3873.64]  Only be delivered
[3873.64 --> 3874.54]  Through
[3874.54 --> 3877.36]  Just utterly decadent means
[3877.36 --> 3878.42]  And you know
[3878.42 --> 3879.02]  But you know
[3879.02 --> 3880.00]  Thank god I can watch
[3880.00 --> 3881.78]  The Simpsons from 30 blocks away
[3881.78 --> 3882.10]  You know
[3882.10 --> 3882.92]  Anyway
[3882.92 --> 3883.56]  So it's
[3883.56 --> 3884.04]  It's
[3884.04 --> 3885.18]  It's really funny
[3885.18 --> 3886.08]  Because it's Weird Al
[3886.08 --> 3886.72]  And he's always funny
[3886.72 --> 3888.46]  So is what you're trying to say
[3888.46 --> 3889.66]  Is that those pictures of that
[3889.66 --> 3890.10]  Were edited?
[3890.74 --> 3891.04]  No
[3891.04 --> 3891.66]  Oh
[3891.66 --> 3892.72]  What I'm trying to say
[3892.72 --> 3893.62]  Is that
[3893.62 --> 3894.48]  That display
[3894.48 --> 3895.30]  Was
[3895.30 --> 3898.54]  2,070 inches
[3898.54 --> 3900.64]  We did it
[3900.64 --> 3902.30]  We made Frank's
[3902.30 --> 3903.50]  2,000 inch TV
[3903.50 --> 3905.82]  That's pretty fantastic
[3905.82 --> 3906.76]  Yeah it ended up being
[3906.76 --> 3908.58]  I forget the exact number
[3908.58 --> 3909.62]  So don't quote me on this
[3909.62 --> 3910.70]  Just wait to watch the video
[3910.70 --> 3911.76]  If you want to know the exact numbers
[3911.76 --> 3912.58]  But it was something like
[3912.58 --> 3914.62]  170 feet wide
[3914.62 --> 3917.18]  Yeah
[3917.18 --> 3918.18]  Yeah
[3918.18 --> 3919.06]  That makes sense
[3919.06 --> 3919.76]  But like wow
[3919.76 --> 3921.90]  By like 30 something feet tall
[3921.90 --> 3923.48]  Absolutely
[3923.48 --> 3925.30]  Enormous
[3925.30 --> 3925.84]  And
[3925.84 --> 3927.94]  Oh
[3927.94 --> 3929.06]  Okay right
[3929.06 --> 3929.88]  Dan was there
[3929.88 --> 3930.50]  Yeah
[3930.50 --> 3932.14]  Dan
[3932.14 --> 3933.34]  I'm gonna say something
[3933.34 --> 3934.88]  That's gonna sound controversial
[3934.88 --> 3935.90]  And then
[3935.90 --> 3936.80]  There's no pressure
[3936.80 --> 3937.82]  To agree with me
[3937.82 --> 3939.04]  But I would love to hear
[3939.04 --> 3939.58]  Your take
[3939.58 --> 3940.96]  One of the games
[3940.96 --> 3941.98]  That we played on it
[3941.98 --> 3943.26]  Was Flight Simulator
[3943.26 --> 3945.30]  And I felt
[3945.30 --> 3947.74]  That it was more immersive
[3947.74 --> 3948.70]  Than VR
[3948.70 --> 3955.00]  Depends on the
[3955.00 --> 3955.72]  Well
[3955.72 --> 3956.70]  Okay so I was
[3956.70 --> 3957.76]  I was playing
[3957.76 --> 3959.36]  Microsoft Flight Simulator
[3959.36 --> 3960.78]  So
[3960.78 --> 3961.82]  I can't remember
[3961.82 --> 3962.76]  If I even watched
[3962.76 --> 3963.42]  Anybody do it
[3963.42 --> 3964.22]  I'm not sure
[3964.22 --> 3965.10]  I would
[3965.10 --> 3966.08]  I would say no
[3966.08 --> 3966.92]  In my opinion
[3966.92 --> 3970.72]  Certainly not playing it
[3970.72 --> 3972.40]  I felt very claustrophobic
[3972.40 --> 3973.34]  In the cockpit
[3973.34 --> 3974.56]  It seemed
[3974.56 --> 3976.54]  It wasn't
[3976.54 --> 3977.54]  Kind of far back enough
[3977.54 --> 3978.64]  Maybe if we had tweaked
[3978.64 --> 3979.10]  The settings
[3979.10 --> 3979.48]  And it would be
[3979.48 --> 3980.08]  A little bit better
[3980.08 --> 3982.56]  Looking around
[3982.56 --> 3983.54]  Wasn't really possible
[3983.54 --> 3984.14]  In the cockpit
[3984.14 --> 3984.46]  You know
[3984.46 --> 3985.64]  Maybe if I turned my head
[3985.64 --> 3986.40]  Something like that
[3986.40 --> 3987.94]  That's a really wide
[3987.94 --> 3988.44]  Flat display
[3988.44 --> 3989.72]  I would say
[3989.72 --> 3990.52]  It's a different
[3990.52 --> 3992.22]  It's a different
[3992.22 --> 3992.90]  Kind of immersive
[3992.90 --> 3993.52]  To VR
[3993.52 --> 3995.22]  VR is like
[3995.22 --> 3996.02]  You're sitting there
[3996.02 --> 3997.24]  And this was kind of like
[3997.24 --> 3999.64]  The next best thing
[3999.64 --> 4000.42]  This is everywhere
[4000.42 --> 4001.58]  It was kind of
[4001.58 --> 4003.74]  More like
[4003.74 --> 4007.08]  It wasn't as
[4007.08 --> 4008.04]  Presence
[4008.04 --> 4009.24]  And as real
[4009.24 --> 4011.00]  As being in VR
[4011.00 --> 4011.46]  Oops
[4011.46 --> 4012.66]  So I played
[4012.66 --> 4013.80]  Some of the other games
[4013.80 --> 4015.02]  But I didn't actually
[4015.02 --> 4016.08]  Play Flight Sim
[4016.08 --> 4018.62]  I watched Dan
[4018.62 --> 4019.52]  Play Flight Sim
[4019.52 --> 4020.78]  So I was
[4020.78 --> 4022.18]  Interesting
[4022.18 --> 4023.12]  Like I was
[4023.12 --> 4024.62]  The passenger
[4024.62 --> 4025.68]  Of the plane
[4025.68 --> 4027.24]  And maybe the fact
[4027.24 --> 4028.26]  That I didn't have
[4028.26 --> 4028.96]  To be focused
[4028.96 --> 4029.82]  On the middle
[4029.82 --> 4030.90]  You can look around
[4030.90 --> 4031.64]  And I could
[4031.64 --> 4034.10]  Like really look
[4034.10 --> 4034.60]  Around
[4034.60 --> 4035.18]  Out over
[4035.18 --> 4036.40]  What feel like
[4036.40 --> 4037.56]  Life size vistas
[4037.56 --> 4038.76]  But because
[4038.76 --> 4039.70]  The display was
[4039.70 --> 4040.96]  So large
[4040.96 --> 4041.68]  That it occupied
[4041.68 --> 4042.84]  Almost my entire
[4042.84 --> 4043.74]  Field of view
[4043.74 --> 4045.26]  Even moving my head
[4045.26 --> 4046.18]  Around a little bit
[4046.18 --> 4048.24]  The sense of scale
[4048.24 --> 4049.16]  Was
[4049.16 --> 4050.90]  Incredible
[4050.90 --> 4052.36]  I got that a lot too
[4052.36 --> 4053.44]  And I wasn't
[4053.44 --> 4054.40]  I wasn't looking
[4054.40 --> 4055.52]  Through a periscope
[4055.52 --> 4056.26]  You know
[4056.26 --> 4058.38]  And modern VR headsets
[4058.38 --> 4059.54]  Have reached a point
[4059.54 --> 4059.98]  Where the
[4059.98 --> 4060.86]  Where the field of view
[4060.86 --> 4061.86]  Is pretty good
[4061.86 --> 4063.44]  That's right
[4063.44 --> 4063.86]  Yeah
[4063.86 --> 4065.22]  But it wasn't even
[4065.22 --> 4066.36]  Close
[4066.36 --> 4069.26]  But it isn't even close
[4069.26 --> 4070.64]  To that experience
[4070.64 --> 4071.26]  Of having
[4071.26 --> 4072.48]  Genuine vastness
[4072.48 --> 4073.96]  You actually get the full
[4073.96 --> 4075.60]  FOV of your eyes
[4075.60 --> 4076.38]  And there's no headset
[4076.38 --> 4077.38]  And like
[4077.38 --> 4077.66]  You're
[4077.66 --> 4078.54]  You're there
[4078.54 --> 4078.98]  I think
[4078.98 --> 4080.14]  I kind of got that
[4080.14 --> 4081.14]  Feeling
[4081.14 --> 4082.12]  The same sort of feeling
[4082.12 --> 4083.18]  Of being the passenger
[4083.18 --> 4084.52]  And just kind of looking
[4084.52 --> 4085.64]  But I'm focused
[4085.64 --> 4086.24]  Dead ahead
[4086.24 --> 4086.96]  Yes
[4086.96 --> 4087.98]  My entire
[4087.98 --> 4089.14]  Field of view
[4089.14 --> 4091.02]  Is just
[4091.02 --> 4092.12]  You know
[4092.12 --> 4092.54]  Langley
[4092.54 --> 4093.42]  And that's the thing
[4093.42 --> 4093.72]  Right
[4093.72 --> 4094.70]  Is that
[4094.70 --> 4095.94]  When I'm playing
[4095.94 --> 4096.84]  A game in VR
[4096.84 --> 4098.88]  This doesn't bother me
[4098.88 --> 4100.42]  Because I'm focused
[4100.42 --> 4100.98]  On this
[4100.98 --> 4101.34]  Yeah
[4101.34 --> 4102.14]  And if I want to see
[4102.14 --> 4102.72]  Something else
[4102.72 --> 4103.86]  I'll do what I would do
[4103.86 --> 4104.44]  In real life
[4104.44 --> 4106.02]  Because we can only
[4106.02 --> 4106.98]  Achieve our
[4106.98 --> 4108.82]  Maximum resolution
[4108.82 --> 4109.18]  Over
[4109.18 --> 4110.16]  What is it
[4110.16 --> 4110.94]  Like a 4%
[4110.94 --> 4111.76]  Of the area
[4111.76 --> 4112.46]  We can see
[4112.46 --> 4113.16]  It's not a lot
[4113.16 --> 4113.74]  And only within
[4113.74 --> 4114.50]  Like a certain
[4114.50 --> 4115.70]  Area
[4115.70 --> 4116.44]  Like it's not
[4116.44 --> 4118.12]  It's not actually
[4118.12 --> 4119.28]  Out here
[4119.28 --> 4119.80]  That you would
[4119.80 --> 4120.78]  You would turn
[4120.78 --> 4121.44]  Your head anyway
[4121.44 --> 4122.62]  So that's really natural
[4122.62 --> 4123.76]  But if I was
[4123.76 --> 4125.42]  If I was an observer
[4125.42 --> 4127.32]  Through that tunnel
[4127.32 --> 4129.78]  I wouldn't like it
[4129.78 --> 4131.72]  Whereas being an observer
[4131.72 --> 4132.88]  On the giant wall
[4132.88 --> 4134.32]  Oh
[4134.32 --> 4135.34]  There's like
[4135.34 --> 4136.60]  More proper terms
[4136.60 --> 4136.82]  Of this
[4136.82 --> 4137.28]  I don't think
[4137.28 --> 4137.98]  This is the right term
[4137.98 --> 4139.28]  But suspension of disbelief
[4139.28 --> 4140.56]  I think is also hurt
[4140.56 --> 4141.18]  By something
[4141.18 --> 4143.50]  Strapped onto your head
[4143.50 --> 4144.64]  Like you're always
[4144.64 --> 4145.26]  Going to be at least
[4145.26 --> 4146.18]  Somewhat aware
[4146.18 --> 4147.76]  Like yeah
[4147.76 --> 4148.52]  You might be convinced
[4148.52 --> 4149.18]  That the plank
[4149.18 --> 4150.86]  You're not convinced
[4150.86 --> 4151.48]  But your brain
[4151.48 --> 4152.32]  Might be freaking out
[4152.32 --> 4152.90]  Because you're walking
[4152.90 --> 4153.58]  On a plank
[4153.58 --> 4155.08]  Above a high rise
[4155.08 --> 4156.44]  And your brain's like
[4156.44 --> 4157.06]  I don't want to fall
[4157.06 --> 4157.66]  Even though you know
[4157.66 --> 4158.18]  You're in VR
[4158.18 --> 4159.60]  But you have this thing
[4159.60 --> 4160.36]  Strapped to your face
[4160.36 --> 4162.08]  There's a lot of cues
[4162.08 --> 4163.00]  To kind of remind you
[4163.00 --> 4165.44]  That it's not
[4165.44 --> 4166.36]  What's actually happening
[4166.36 --> 4167.08]  Thinking back
[4167.08 --> 4168.14]  There was a number
[4168.14 --> 4168.68]  Of moments
[4168.68 --> 4170.02]  Where I don't know
[4170.02 --> 4170.86]  Everything just kind of
[4170.86 --> 4171.38]  Fell away
[4171.38 --> 4172.52]  Because you're looking
[4172.52 --> 4173.12]  At a monitor
[4173.12 --> 4175.02]  But you're focused
[4175.02 --> 4176.16]  Quite close to you
[4176.16 --> 4177.14]  And you don't have
[4177.14 --> 4177.46]  A headset
[4177.46 --> 4178.38]  So you don't have
[4178.38 --> 4179.00]  Any of the
[4179.00 --> 4180.56]  Perception of things
[4180.56 --> 4181.62]  Touching you
[4181.62 --> 4182.40]  Or that you're
[4182.40 --> 4182.96]  Wearing a headset
[4182.96 --> 4183.52]  That's kind of
[4183.52 --> 4184.18]  Harder to forget
[4184.18 --> 4185.62]  But when you're
[4185.62 --> 4186.46]  In front of basically
[4186.46 --> 4187.38]  Just this window
[4187.38 --> 4188.84]  That goes into the sky
[4188.84 --> 4190.76]  I think that
[4190.76 --> 4191.42]  That kind of
[4191.42 --> 4192.54]  Dissociation happens
[4192.54 --> 4193.26]  A hell of a lot
[4193.26 --> 4193.98]  Faster than with
[4193.98 --> 4194.64]  Anything I've felt
[4194.64 --> 4195.00]  Before
[4195.00 --> 4196.40]  I did not feel
[4196.40 --> 4197.32]  Like I was looking
[4197.32 --> 4197.96]  At a wall
[4197.96 --> 4199.14]  It didn't look
[4199.14 --> 4199.64]  Like a monitor
[4199.64 --> 4201.02]  It looked like
[4201.02 --> 4201.78]  I was flying
[4201.78 --> 4203.50]  A window
[4203.50 --> 4204.68]  Into
[4204.68 --> 4206.02]  Into something else
[4206.02 --> 4206.72]  And the sense
[4206.72 --> 4207.88]  Of motion
[4207.88 --> 4208.68]  That I got
[4208.68 --> 4209.72]  Was so much
[4209.72 --> 4210.44]  More convincing
[4210.44 --> 4211.42]  Than at least
[4211.42 --> 4212.58]  Any other
[4212.58 --> 4213.40]  Flat display
[4213.40 --> 4214.04]  That I have
[4214.04 --> 4215.34]  Ever experienced
[4215.34 --> 4216.28]  Just because of
[4216.28 --> 4216.86]  The sheer
[4216.86 --> 4218.36]  Vastness of it
[4218.36 --> 4219.82]  It was a really
[4219.82 --> 4220.48]  Cool setup
[4220.48 --> 4221.78]  We actually
[4221.78 --> 4222.22]  Ended up
[4222.22 --> 4222.84]  Shooting two
[4222.84 --> 4223.82]  Videos that day
[4223.82 --> 4224.54]  Instead of just
[4224.54 --> 4224.86]  One
[4224.86 --> 4225.96]  We shot one
[4225.96 --> 4226.52]  That's like
[4226.52 --> 4227.38]  A land center
[4227.38 --> 4228.60]  Slash badminton
[4228.60 --> 4229.70]  Center update
[4229.70 --> 4231.18]  Because people
[4231.18 --> 4231.46]  Had
[4231.46 --> 4232.22]  I had to approve
[4232.22 --> 4232.76]  Dan's time
[4232.76 --> 4233.10]  For this
[4233.10 --> 4233.54]  Oh okay
[4233.54 --> 4234.04]  Yeah
[4234.04 --> 4234.98]  People had to
[4234.98 --> 4236.70]  People had more
[4236.70 --> 4237.26]  Questions
[4237.26 --> 4239.16]  That they raised
[4239.16 --> 4239.82]  Than they felt
[4239.82 --> 4240.42]  Were answered
[4240.42 --> 4241.40]  By the first video
[4241.40 --> 4242.26]  So we ended up
[4242.26 --> 4242.54]  Talking
[4242.54 --> 4243.56]  Actually I don't
[4243.56 --> 4244.20]  Think I've really
[4244.20 --> 4244.98]  Addressed anyone's
[4244.98 --> 4245.60]  Questions from the
[4245.60 --> 4246.00]  First video
[4246.00 --> 4246.68]  But the point is
[4246.68 --> 4247.48]  There's cool stuff
[4247.48 --> 4249.68]  And we talk about it
[4249.68 --> 4250.28]  Dan goes through
[4250.28 --> 4250.60]  Some of the
[4250.60 --> 4251.18]  Networking stuff
[4251.18 --> 4252.06]  Our armored fiber
[4252.06 --> 4252.88]  Is on site
[4252.88 --> 4254.32]  Ready for installation
[4254.32 --> 4255.28]  So we do a little
[4255.28 --> 4256.66]  We do a little
[4256.66 --> 4258.26]  Autopsy on the fiber
[4258.26 --> 4258.78]  That we're going to
[4258.78 --> 4259.46]  Be rolling out
[4259.46 --> 4260.10]  And stuff like that
[4260.10 --> 4260.60]  It's a really cool
[4260.60 --> 4260.92]  Video
[4260.92 --> 4261.84]  And then at the
[4261.84 --> 4262.32]  End of it
[4262.32 --> 4263.74]  Chase shows off
[4263.74 --> 4264.32]  Kind of what we
[4264.32 --> 4265.40]  Have planned for
[4265.40 --> 4266.90]  A big projector
[4266.90 --> 4268.90]  Gaming console corner
[4268.90 --> 4270.18]  And we grabbed
[4270.18 --> 4271.46]  The 120 inch screen
[4271.46 --> 4272.24]  From my
[4272.24 --> 4273.00]  That used to be
[4273.00 --> 4273.54]  In my basement
[4273.54 --> 4274.98]  And we put that
[4274.98 --> 4275.42]  Up and then we
[4275.42 --> 4275.66]  Go
[4275.66 --> 4277.94]  Yeah but it's
[4277.94 --> 4278.66]  Dark enough in here
[4278.66 --> 4279.46]  We could go bigger
[4279.46 --> 4281.82]  And we kind of
[4281.82 --> 4283.16]  Just throw as big
[4283.16 --> 4283.82]  Of an image as
[4283.82 --> 4285.08]  We conceivably can
[4285.08 --> 4286.32]  With the projector
[4286.32 --> 4287.06]  That I had in my
[4287.06 --> 4287.90]  Basement at the
[4287.90 --> 4288.66]  Wall until we
[4288.66 --> 4289.58]  Realize okay
[4289.58 --> 4292.30]  Yeah you can only
[4292.30 --> 4293.62]  Go so big no
[4293.62 --> 4294.34]  Matter how dark
[4294.34 --> 4295.08]  It is before it
[4295.08 --> 4295.68]  Starts to look
[4295.68 --> 4296.48]  Washed out and
[4296.48 --> 4297.72]  Garbo right
[4297.72 --> 4300.82]  Then we go from
[4300.82 --> 4302.24]  2700 lumens
[4302.24 --> 4304.36]  To working with
[4304.36 --> 4305.28]  An AV company
[4305.28 --> 4306.22]  That specializes
[4306.22 --> 4306.82]  In these kinds
[4306.82 --> 4307.56]  Of deployments
[4307.56 --> 4308.82]  To a
[4308.82 --> 4310.32]  Multi projector
[4310.32 --> 4312.78]  12000
[4312.78 --> 4313.90]  Lumens
[4313.90 --> 4314.38]  Set up
[4314.38 --> 4315.02]  And
[4315.02 --> 4317.50]  Yeah
[4317.50 --> 4318.12]  There's
[4318.12 --> 4318.42]  There's
[4318.42 --> 4319.02]  There's no
[4319.02 --> 4319.86]  Way to
[4319.86 --> 4321.54]  There's
[4321.54 --> 4322.22]  There's nothing
[4322.22 --> 4322.74]  I can say
[4322.74 --> 4323.10]  Other than
[4323.10 --> 4323.64]  It's unlike
[4323.64 --> 4324.38]  Anything I've
[4324.38 --> 4324.86]  Ever
[4324.86 --> 4325.90]  Experienced
[4325.90 --> 4326.38]  I kind of
[4326.38 --> 4326.80]  Did want to
[4326.80 --> 4327.08]  See it
[4327.08 --> 4327.34]  But
[4327.34 --> 4328.06]  I'm sorry
[4328.06 --> 4329.06]  No no no
[4329.06 --> 4329.72]  Can you imagine
[4329.72 --> 4331.00]  That at 240 hertz
[4331.00 --> 4332.02]  I know
[4332.02 --> 4332.66]  It was only at
[4332.66 --> 4333.16]  60
[4333.16 --> 4334.44]  HDR 4k
[4334.44 --> 4335.50]  240 hertz
[4335.50 --> 4336.80]  2000 inch
[4336.80 --> 4336.98]  Wall
[4336.98 --> 4337.42]  I guess what
[4337.42 --> 4337.80]  You're saying
[4337.80 --> 4338.28]  Is you want to
[4338.28 --> 4339.20]  Redo it
[4339.20 --> 4339.60]  Yeah do it
[4339.60 --> 4339.78]  Better
[4339.78 --> 4340.52]  Yeah do it
[4340.52 --> 4340.82]  Better
[4340.82 --> 4341.54]  Bigger building
[4341.54 --> 4344.08]  No
[4344.08 --> 4344.54]  I
[4344.54 --> 4345.90]  No
[4345.90 --> 4347.22]  That that's
[4347.22 --> 4347.66]  That's going to
[4347.66 --> 4348.14]  Be a no
[4348.14 --> 4349.08]  Thank you for
[4349.08 --> 4349.64]  The suggestion
[4349.64 --> 4350.04]  Though Dan
[4350.04 --> 4350.64]  Appreciate you
[4350.64 --> 4351.30]  You could use
[4351.30 --> 4351.58]  It for the
[4351.58 --> 4352.52]  New town
[4352.52 --> 4353.26]  There's not
[4353.26 --> 4353.54]  Yeah
[4353.54 --> 4354.50]  A new town
[4354.50 --> 4355.14]  Yeah
[4355.14 --> 4356.00]  None of these
[4356.00 --> 4356.42]  People know
[4356.42 --> 4356.76]  What you're
[4356.76 --> 4357.48]  Talking about
[4357.48 --> 4358.42]  It's on the
[4358.42 --> 4359.00]  Pre-show
[4359.00 --> 4361.86]  That makes it
[4361.86 --> 4362.16]  Better
[4362.16 --> 4363.80]  No inside
[4363.80 --> 4364.36]  Jokes are
[4364.36 --> 4365.04]  Not good
[4365.04 --> 4366.74]  All right Dan
[4366.74 --> 4367.04]  Do you want to
[4367.04 --> 4367.38]  Hit us with
[4367.38 --> 4367.82]  One more
[4367.82 --> 4369.90]  Wrong button
[4369.90 --> 4370.48]  Yep sure
[4370.48 --> 4371.12]  I got one more
[4371.12 --> 4372.86]  Let's see
[4372.86 --> 4375.64]  Evening DLL
[4375.64 --> 4376.68]  What happens
[4376.68 --> 4377.92]  If the CPUs
[4377.92 --> 4378.92]  Binned for the
[4378.92 --> 4379.78]  Labs test
[4379.78 --> 4380.72]  Benches fail
[4380.72 --> 4381.64]  Do you restart
[4381.64 --> 4382.16]  The process
[4382.16 --> 4382.84]  Are there any
[4382.84 --> 4383.28]  Spares
[4383.28 --> 4383.96]  Are they
[4383.96 --> 4384.42]  Expected to
[4384.42 --> 4385.02]  Be obsolete
[4385.02 --> 4385.74]  Or replaced
[4385.74 --> 4386.64]  Before they
[4386.64 --> 4386.96]  Fail
[4386.96 --> 4387.64]  I really
[4387.64 --> 4388.16]  Hope they
[4388.16 --> 4388.66]  Don't
[4388.66 --> 4389.58]  But as
[4389.58 --> 4389.94]  Part of
[4389.94 --> 4390.48]  Our process
[4390.48 --> 4391.10]  We're going
[4391.10 --> 4391.46]  To be
[4391.46 --> 4392.20]  Retesting
[4392.20 --> 4392.88]  Anyway
[4392.88 --> 4394.02]  And with
[4394.02 --> 4394.20]  New
[4394.20 --> 4394.60]  Agisa
[4394.60 --> 4395.34]  Updates
[4395.34 --> 4395.74]  Bios
[4395.74 --> 4396.42]  Updates
[4396.42 --> 4397.50]  Driver
[4397.50 --> 4398.20]  Updates
[4398.20 --> 4399.70]  The ones
[4399.70 --> 4400.06]  That we're
[4400.06 --> 4400.74]  Using may
[4400.74 --> 4401.40]  Change
[4401.40 --> 4402.10]  Anyway
[4402.10 --> 4403.14]  So
[4403.14 --> 4404.88]  It's something
[4404.88 --> 4405.22]  We're going to
[4405.22 --> 4405.64]  Have to go
[4405.64 --> 4406.00]  Through
[4406.00 --> 4407.44]  Regardless of
[4407.44 --> 4408.62]  Whether one
[4408.62 --> 4409.08]  Of them dies
[4409.08 --> 4409.74]  Or whether one
[4409.74 --> 4410.28]  Of them doesn't
[4410.28 --> 4410.72]  So it's
[4410.72 --> 4411.76]  I think it's
[4411.76 --> 4412.04]  Just
[4412.04 --> 4413.72]  Oh my
[4413.72 --> 4414.14]  Gosh
[4414.14 --> 4415.56]  I'm an
[4415.56 --> 4416.00]  Idiot
[4416.00 --> 4417.10]  What
[4417.10 --> 4418.32]  Remember I was
[4418.32 --> 4418.90]  All concerned
[4418.90 --> 4419.70]  About showing
[4419.70 --> 4420.50]  People the scale
[4420.50 --> 4421.02]  Of the thermal
[4421.02 --> 4421.42]  Pads
[4421.42 --> 4423.50]  I have them
[4423.50 --> 4425.58]  Yeah
[4425.58 --> 4426.42]  Yeah I didn't
[4426.42 --> 4427.16]  Think of that
[4427.16 --> 4428.02]  They're right
[4428.02 --> 4428.34]  Here
[4428.34 --> 4428.80]  Oh
[4428.80 --> 4429.32]  I didn't
[4429.32 --> 4429.76]  Realize this
[4429.76 --> 4430.16]  Was a thing
[4430.16 --> 4430.54]  That happened
[4430.54 --> 4430.94]  Probably because
[4430.94 --> 4431.18]  I'm pretty
[4431.18 --> 4431.52]  Out of it
[4431.52 --> 4431.94]  But yeah
[4431.94 --> 4432.76]  Cool
[4432.76 --> 4433.10]  Yeah
[4433.10 --> 4433.58]  Anyway
[4433.58 --> 4434.16]  So the big
[4434.16 --> 4434.50]  Ones
[4434.50 --> 4435.52]  I mean you're
[4435.52 --> 4435.92]  You're supposed
[4435.92 --> 4436.58]  To cut kind of
[4436.58 --> 4436.96]  Both of them
[4436.96 --> 4437.42]  But one of
[4437.42 --> 4438.24]  These is like
[4438.24 --> 4439.04]  This is
[4439.04 --> 4439.90]  You're installing
[4439.90 --> 4440.56]  A cpu
[4440.56 --> 4441.30]  You're installing
[4441.30 --> 4442.14]  One cpu
[4442.14 --> 4443.96]  One giant cpu
[4443.96 --> 4445.22]  Or four smaller
[4445.22 --> 4445.86]  Ones
[4445.86 --> 4446.36]  Oh
[4446.36 --> 4446.84]  Yeah
[4446.84 --> 4447.62]  You could do
[4447.62 --> 4448.02]  Four smaller ones
[4448.02 --> 4448.50]  Yeah you totally
[4448.50 --> 4448.70]  Could
[4448.70 --> 4449.40]  Like I could do
[4449.40 --> 4450.94]  I could easily do
[4450.94 --> 4453.00]  Four ryzen 7000s
[4453.00 --> 4453.40]  With this
[4453.40 --> 4454.52]  But unquestionably
[4454.52 --> 4455.06]  You'll be able to
[4455.06 --> 4455.82]  Get one install
[4455.82 --> 4456.42]  For a cpu
[4456.42 --> 4457.06]  From that
[4457.06 --> 4457.52]  Pretty much
[4457.52 --> 4458.38]  Regardless of size
[4458.38 --> 4458.96]  Yes
[4458.96 --> 4459.56]  I can't think of
[4459.56 --> 4460.18]  One that wouldn't
[4460.18 --> 4460.40]  Work
[4460.40 --> 4461.72]  I think some of
[4461.72 --> 4463.04]  The big epics
[4463.04 --> 4464.98]  You'd probably
[4464.98 --> 4465.90]  Cover all the dyes
[4465.90 --> 4466.64]  Probably be fine
[4466.64 --> 4467.04]  But I just
[4467.04 --> 4467.78]  Wouldn't
[4467.78 --> 4468.64]  You just
[4468.64 --> 4469.24]  Get this big
[4469.24 --> 4469.80]  You just spent
[4469.80 --> 4471.24]  Nine hundred dollars
[4471.24 --> 4472.16]  You know two thousand
[4472.16 --> 4473.16]  Dollars on a cpu
[4473.16 --> 4473.94]  Just get a proper
[4473.94 --> 4474.88]  Thermal pad for it
[4474.88 --> 4475.84]  So that's what
[4475.84 --> 4476.58]  The big mama
[4476.58 --> 4477.76]  Is for
[4477.76 --> 4478.90]  That's a big
[4478.90 --> 4479.56]  Thermal pad
[4479.56 --> 4480.80]  So that's
[4480.80 --> 4481.82]  A lot
[4481.82 --> 4483.08]  Of cpu
[4483.08 --> 4483.68]  Installations
[4483.68 --> 4484.00]  Yeah you can cut that
[4484.00 --> 4484.76]  To whatever you want
[4484.76 --> 4484.98]  Yeah
[4484.98 --> 4486.22]  Yeah
[4486.22 --> 4488.86]  And sarah designed
[4488.86 --> 4489.88]  Really nice packaging
[4489.88 --> 4490.60]  For it
[4490.60 --> 4491.00]  And everything
[4491.00 --> 4491.64]  Yeah
[4491.64 --> 4493.82]  So I'm pretty excited
[4493.82 --> 4494.20]  About that
[4494.20 --> 4494.88]  Looks very professional
[4494.88 --> 4496.26]  Showed up to work
[4496.26 --> 4498.30]  Showed up to cool
[4498.30 --> 4499.24]  Your cpu for you
[4499.24 --> 4500.66]  Or whatever else
[4500.66 --> 4501.36]  Thanks luke
[4501.36 --> 4502.10]  You're doing great today
[4502.10 --> 4502.48]  Yeah
[4502.48 --> 4504.80]  I'm gonna crush him
[4504.80 --> 4505.74]  At superchecks tonight
[4505.74 --> 4507.60]  If I even make it
[4507.60 --> 4509.54]  He beat me last week
[4509.54 --> 4510.40]  I'm so upset
[4510.40 --> 4511.16]  Got him
[4511.16 --> 4512.56]  I'm so upset
[4512.56 --> 4513.18]  He was sick
[4513.18 --> 4514.96]  That last game
[4514.96 --> 4516.36]  I'm still unhappy
[4516.36 --> 4518.02]  I think I was less sick
[4518.02 --> 4518.94]  Then funny enough
[4518.94 --> 4519.80]  Yeah well good
[4519.80 --> 4522.44]  You're going down this week
[4522.44 --> 4523.52]  I outshot him
[4523.52 --> 4524.14]  Two to one
[4524.14 --> 4525.80]  I'm also grievously wounded
[4525.80 --> 4526.60]  I outshot him
[4526.60 --> 4527.50]  Two to one
[4527.50 --> 4528.74]  And he outscored me
[4528.74 --> 4529.32]  Three to
[4529.32 --> 4530.06]  Got him
[4530.06 --> 4531.06]  So unhappy
[4531.06 --> 4531.90]  Goalie
[4531.90 --> 4532.74]  Standing on his head
[4532.74 --> 4533.42]  Anyway
[4533.42 --> 4534.44]  The point is
[4534.44 --> 4535.84]  Jump into our next topic
[4535.84 --> 4536.48]  Dude I've had some
[4536.48 --> 4537.92]  Insane manual blocks
[4537.92 --> 4539.94]  Insane
[4539.94 --> 4540.78]  Yes I know
[4540.78 --> 4542.32]  I was there
[4542.32 --> 4543.30]  You have too
[4543.30 --> 4543.92]  But like
[4543.92 --> 4544.46]  You know
[4544.46 --> 4548.48]  You know
[4548.48 --> 4549.30]  You didn't get a lot
[4549.30 --> 4550.26]  More goals on me
[4550.26 --> 4552.28]  Nope
[4552.28 --> 4553.30]  Alright what are we
[4553.30 --> 4554.08]  Talking about now
[4554.08 --> 4555.50]  I also got a lot
[4555.50 --> 4556.62]  Less shots though
[4556.62 --> 4559.36]  Troy Hunt
[4559.36 --> 4560.56]  Is having an issue
[4560.56 --> 4562.06]  With his Sonos setup
[4562.06 --> 4562.78]  Oh
[4562.78 --> 4566.10]  I feel like
[4566.10 --> 4566.90]  I'm going to regret
[4566.90 --> 4568.04]  Going down this rabbit hole
[4568.04 --> 4568.88]  Before even asking
[4568.88 --> 4569.64]  But here goes
[4569.64 --> 4570.60]  We have eight
[4570.60 --> 4571.48]  Sonos devices
[4571.48 --> 4572.10]  Three wired
[4572.10 --> 4573.16]  The rest wireless
[4573.16 --> 4574.72]  We have massive
[4574.72 --> 4575.58]  Wi-Fi coverage
[4575.58 --> 4576.74]  With Ubiquity mesh gear
[4576.74 --> 4577.82]  But are now having
[4577.82 --> 4578.82]  Major problems
[4578.82 --> 4579.36]  Playing audio
[4579.36 --> 4580.02]  To multiple rooms
[4580.02 --> 4580.96]  With constant dropouts
[4580.96 --> 4581.74]  Regular unable to
[4581.74 --> 4582.46]  Connect to device errors
[4582.46 --> 4583.26]  Units appearing offline
[4583.26 --> 4584.12]  And so on
[4584.12 --> 4585.24]  For more up to date
[4585.24 --> 4585.70]  Everywhere
[4585.70 --> 4586.42]  Power cycles
[4586.42 --> 4587.08]  And network reboots
[4587.08 --> 4588.22]  But the problems persist
[4588.22 --> 4588.82]  I'm guessing it's
[4588.82 --> 4589.60]  Somehow network related
[4589.60 --> 4590.30]  But I don't even know
[4590.30 --> 4591.28]  Where to begin on this one
[4591.28 --> 4592.10]  Ideas
[4592.10 --> 4593.56]  I have two ideas
[4593.56 --> 4595.48]  Idea number one
[4595.48 --> 4596.88]  Is if you have
[4596.88 --> 4598.08]  The 2.4 gigahertz
[4598.08 --> 4599.00]  Radios enabled
[4599.00 --> 4599.84]  On all of your
[4599.84 --> 4600.74]  Ubiquity units
[4600.74 --> 4602.02]  Go through
[4602.02 --> 4603.58]  And strategically disable
[4603.58 --> 4604.30]  A bunch of them
[4604.30 --> 4606.06]  I actually ran into this
[4606.06 --> 4607.32]  Recently with my setup
[4607.32 --> 4608.34]  Where I had everything
[4608.34 --> 4609.18]  On default
[4609.18 --> 4610.40]  I had all the
[4610.40 --> 4611.20]  2.4 gigahertz
[4611.20 --> 4611.94]  Radios on
[4611.94 --> 4613.02]  And I had them all set
[4613.02 --> 4613.66]  To automatic
[4613.66 --> 4614.52]  Channel selection
[4614.52 --> 4616.30]  And on recent
[4616.30 --> 4616.74]  From where this
[4616.74 --> 4617.74]  Was very recent
[4617.74 --> 4618.74]  They were all
[4618.74 --> 4619.72]  Selecting channel one
[4619.72 --> 4620.44]  For some reason
[4620.44 --> 4622.24]  And with all of them
[4622.24 --> 4623.28]  I have something like
[4623.28 --> 4624.30]  Eight access points
[4624.30 --> 4624.74]  In my house
[4624.74 --> 4625.46]  Or something like that
[4625.46 --> 4626.18]  With all of them
[4626.18 --> 4626.94]  On channel one
[4626.94 --> 4628.12]  Even just
[4628.12 --> 4629.72]  The regular
[4629.72 --> 4630.78]  Pinging of
[4630.78 --> 4631.66]  Hey are you there
[4631.66 --> 4634.04]  Was annihilating
[4634.04 --> 4635.08]  The available
[4635.08 --> 4637.88]  Like the available
[4637.88 --> 4639.04]  Not bandwidth
[4639.04 --> 4639.82]  But just
[4639.82 --> 4641.32]  The available spectrum
[4641.32 --> 4644.00]  Utilization
[4644.00 --> 4645.32]  Was capped
[4645.32 --> 4646.38]  And so I was
[4646.38 --> 4647.02]  Having dropouts
[4647.02 --> 4647.54]  Not with my
[4647.54 --> 4648.26]  Sonos devices
[4648.26 --> 4648.84]  Necessarily
[4648.84 --> 4649.46]  But with some
[4649.46 --> 4649.90]  Devices
[4649.90 --> 4651.20]  And I was
[4651.20 --> 4651.84]  Getting music
[4651.84 --> 4652.54]  Cutting out
[4652.54 --> 4653.80]  However
[4653.80 --> 4655.00]  I went through
[4655.00 --> 4656.00]  And
[4656.00 --> 4658.64]  Jake actually
[4658.64 --> 4659.52]  Recommended this
[4659.52 --> 4660.22]  Picked
[4660.22 --> 4661.50]  One per floor
[4661.50 --> 4662.14]  To go to
[4662.14 --> 4663.00]  2.4 gigahertz
[4663.00 --> 4663.30]  And then
[4663.30 --> 4664.40]  Disabled 2.4
[4664.40 --> 4665.02]  On all the rest
[4665.02 --> 4665.28]  Of them
[4665.28 --> 4666.56]  That resolved
[4666.56 --> 4667.14]  The dropouts
[4667.14 --> 4667.54]  I was getting
[4667.54 --> 4668.20]  From other devices
[4668.20 --> 4668.86]  But I was still
[4668.86 --> 4669.38]  Getting cutouts
[4669.38 --> 4669.68]  From my
[4669.68 --> 4670.32]  Sonos units
[4670.32 --> 4672.16]  And Yvonne
[4672.16 --> 4673.44]  Made the suggestion
[4673.44 --> 4673.98]  That
[4673.98 --> 4675.46]  You know
[4675.46 --> 4676.84]  Not suggestion
[4676.84 --> 4677.68]  But she asked
[4677.68 --> 4678.14]  A question
[4678.14 --> 4678.60]  Because
[4678.60 --> 4679.96]  She's been
[4679.96 --> 4680.64]  Married to me
[4680.64 --> 4681.18]  For a thousand
[4681.18 --> 4681.60]  Years
[4681.60 --> 4682.64]  And listens
[4682.64 --> 4683.42]  And you know
[4683.42 --> 4684.04]  She just tries
[4684.04 --> 4684.66]  To participate
[4684.66 --> 4685.66]  And it's delightful
[4685.66 --> 4687.64]  She's not into tech
[4687.64 --> 4688.70]  But she knows a lot
[4688.70 --> 4689.24]  Is what I'm trying
[4689.24 --> 4689.56]  To say
[4689.56 --> 4690.42]  And she kind of
[4690.42 --> 4691.14]  Goes oh well
[4691.14 --> 4691.42]  You know
[4691.42 --> 4691.92]  Could it be a
[4691.92 --> 4692.58]  Wireless issue
[4692.58 --> 4693.76]  And I go
[4693.76 --> 4695.20]  No it doesn't
[4695.20 --> 4695.84]  Make any sense
[4695.84 --> 4696.84]  They're all wired
[4696.84 --> 4698.56]  All of my
[4698.56 --> 4699.28]  Sonos units
[4699.28 --> 4700.24]  Except one
[4700.24 --> 4701.28]  Are wired
[4701.28 --> 4703.36]  And then
[4703.36 --> 4704.68]  I went into
[4704.68 --> 4705.24]  The app
[4705.24 --> 4706.94]  And I found
[4706.94 --> 4707.50]  That
[4707.50 --> 4708.22]  Are they all
[4708.22 --> 4709.34]  Working wirelessly
[4709.34 --> 4709.80]  Anyways
[4709.80 --> 4710.94]  Even though
[4710.94 --> 4711.70]  They are all
[4711.70 --> 4712.48]  Plugged in
[4712.48 --> 4713.76]  There's a setting
[4713.76 --> 4714.40]  In the app
[4714.40 --> 4716.66]  To disable
[4716.66 --> 4717.70]  Wireless on them
[4717.70 --> 4719.08]  Now I don't
[4719.08 --> 4719.88]  Know for sure
[4719.88 --> 4720.72]  That they were
[4720.72 --> 4721.96]  Working wirelessly
[4721.96 --> 4723.46]  But what I will
[4723.46 --> 4724.52]  Say is after
[4724.52 --> 4725.76]  I painstakingly
[4725.76 --> 4726.54]  Went through
[4726.54 --> 4727.08]  And disabled
[4727.08 --> 4727.80]  Wireless on all
[4727.80 --> 4728.02]  Of them
[4728.02 --> 4728.82]  Which is a
[4728.82 --> 4729.88]  Horrible experience
[4729.88 --> 4730.34]  By the way
[4730.34 --> 4731.02]  Sonos if you're
[4731.02 --> 4731.36]  Watching
[4731.36 --> 4732.12]  Because
[4732.12 --> 4733.98]  Because you
[4733.98 --> 4734.74]  Can't do it
[4734.74 --> 4735.26]  Wholesale
[4735.26 --> 4737.06]  Because as
[4737.06 --> 4737.54]  Part of the
[4737.54 --> 4738.20]  Process you
[4738.20 --> 4738.78]  Have to navigate
[4738.78 --> 4739.46]  Through like
[4739.46 --> 4740.02]  Two or three
[4740.02 --> 4740.64]  Different sub
[4740.64 --> 4741.56]  Menus to even
[4741.56 --> 4742.42]  Get to that
[4742.42 --> 4743.34]  Button for that
[4743.34 --> 4743.58]  One
[4743.58 --> 4744.40]  And number
[4744.40 --> 4744.82]  Three
[4744.82 --> 4745.62]  It has to go
[4745.62 --> 4746.58]  Through a process
[4746.58 --> 4747.38]  Where it
[4747.38 --> 4748.52]  Determines if
[4748.52 --> 4748.98]  It has a
[4748.98 --> 4749.60]  Wired connection
[4749.60 --> 4750.64]  Before it will
[4750.64 --> 4751.50]  Allow you
[4751.50 --> 4752.48]  To disable the
[4752.48 --> 4753.06]  Wireless connection
[4753.06 --> 4753.36]  Which I
[4753.36 --> 4753.86]  Understand
[4753.86 --> 4754.90]  But what I
[4754.90 --> 4755.70]  Don't understand
[4755.70 --> 4756.60]  Is why it
[4756.60 --> 4757.46]  Takes like
[4757.46 --> 4758.58]  Thirty seconds
[4758.58 --> 4759.18]  For it to
[4759.18 --> 4759.78]  Determine that
[4759.78 --> 4760.44]  And can I
[4760.44 --> 4761.02]  Just go on
[4761.02 --> 4761.70]  A side rant
[4761.70 --> 4762.00]  Here
[4762.00 --> 4763.64]  Why the
[4763.64 --> 4764.52]  Ever loving
[4764.52 --> 4765.18]  F**k
[4765.18 --> 4766.36]  Does it take
[4766.36 --> 4766.98]  So long for
[4766.98 --> 4767.76]  A device to
[4767.76 --> 4768.30]  Tell you if it
[4768.30 --> 4769.20]  Has a f**king
[4769.20 --> 4770.08]  Internet connection
[4770.08 --> 4771.40]  If it has
[4771.40 --> 4771.92]  One or not
[4771.92 --> 4772.28]  Yes
[4772.28 --> 4774.14]  It drives me
[4774.14 --> 4775.60]  Bat crap
[4775.60 --> 4776.56]  Crazy
[4776.56 --> 4777.86]  Whether it's
[4777.86 --> 4778.74]  A game console
[4778.74 --> 4779.68]  Or a tv
[4779.68 --> 4780.46]  Where it does
[4780.46 --> 4780.72]  That
[4780.72 --> 4782.56]  Man remember
[4782.56 --> 4783.14]  The Wii
[4783.14 --> 4784.90]  How long
[4784.90 --> 4785.54]  It would take
[4785.54 --> 4786.32]  To know if
[4786.32 --> 4786.84]  It had a
[4786.84 --> 4787.34]  F**king
[4787.34 --> 4788.22]  Internet connection
[4788.22 --> 4789.74]  How many
[4789.74 --> 4790.66]  Milliseconds
[4790.66 --> 4792.12]  Does it take
[4792.12 --> 4793.24]  To ping
[4793.24 --> 4794.42]  Something
[4794.42 --> 4795.82]  Do you have
[4795.82 --> 4796.24]  An interconnect
[4796.24 --> 4796.86]  Connection
[4796.86 --> 4797.58]  Yes
[4797.58 --> 4799.08]  Or no
[4799.08 --> 4800.72]  Yeah I wonder
[4800.72 --> 4801.16]  If like
[4801.16 --> 4802.08]  What exactly
[4802.08 --> 4802.46]  They're doing
[4802.46 --> 4802.82]  I'm sure
[4802.82 --> 4803.30]  I'm sure
[4803.30 --> 4803.98]  They're probably
[4803.98 --> 4804.90]  Doing more
[4804.90 --> 4805.50]  Than that
[4805.50 --> 4806.24]  Obviously
[4806.24 --> 4807.04]  Yeah
[4807.04 --> 4808.06]  What is it
[4808.06 --> 4808.76]  I'm not sure
[4808.76 --> 4810.24]  And
[4810.24 --> 4810.58]  I feel like
[4810.58 --> 4811.32]  There has to be
[4811.32 --> 4812.62]  Some convoluted
[4812.62 --> 4813.58]  Phone home thing
[4813.58 --> 4814.46]  Instead of just
[4814.46 --> 4814.78]  Like
[4814.78 --> 4815.88]  Ping google
[4815.88 --> 4816.24]  Or something
[4816.24 --> 4816.68]  Some of the
[4816.68 --> 4817.12]  Newer ones
[4817.12 --> 4817.94]  Do a speed test
[4817.94 --> 4819.06]  And they will
[4819.06 --> 4819.90]  Report the result
[4819.90 --> 4820.38]  Of that
[4820.38 --> 4820.88]  Got it
[4820.88 --> 4821.84]  And that makes
[4821.84 --> 4822.22]  Sense
[4822.22 --> 4823.22]  You cannot
[4823.22 --> 4824.48]  Determine how
[4824.48 --> 4825.16]  Fast a connection
[4825.16 --> 4825.72]  Is without
[4825.72 --> 4826.66]  Transferring some
[4826.66 --> 4827.26]  Amount of data
[4827.26 --> 4828.12]  Over some
[4828.12 --> 4828.98]  Period of time
[4828.98 --> 4829.60]  Longer than
[4829.60 --> 4830.48]  Probably the
[4830.48 --> 4830.84]  You know
[4830.84 --> 4831.90]  Nine milliseconds
[4831.90 --> 4832.42]  That it would
[4832.42 --> 4832.70]  Take to
[4832.70 --> 4832.88]  Ping
[4832.88 --> 4833.52]  Near google
[4833.52 --> 4833.98]  Data center
[4833.98 --> 4834.34]  Do we want
[4834.34 --> 4834.74]  To tell the
[4834.74 --> 4835.22]  User that
[4835.22 --> 4835.70]  There is an
[4835.70 --> 4836.22]  Internet connection
[4836.22 --> 4836.68]  If we don't
[4836.68 --> 4836.96]  Know it's
[4836.96 --> 4837.48]  Stable yet
[4837.48 --> 4838.10]  But a lot
[4838.10 --> 4838.34]  Of them
[4838.34 --> 4839.22]  Don't
[4839.22 --> 4840.04]  Appear to be
[4840.04 --> 4840.58]  Doing that
[4840.58 --> 4841.56]  And just
[4841.56 --> 4843.38]  Yeah I'm not sure
[4843.38 --> 4843.98]  Just take a long
[4843.98 --> 4844.18]  Time
[4844.18 --> 4844.74]  There's
[4844.74 --> 4845.20]  There's a
[4845.20 --> 4845.94]  There's a lot
[4845.94 --> 4846.42]  Of stuff
[4846.42 --> 4847.28]  Like that
[4847.28 --> 4847.90]  That I just
[4847.90 --> 4849.80]  I gotta tell you guys
[4849.80 --> 4850.74]  I just don't
[4850.74 --> 4850.76]  I just don't
[4850.76 --> 4850.80]  I just don't
[4850.80 --> 4852.32]  Really understand
[4852.32 --> 4853.38]  Um
[4853.38 --> 4854.54]  With how many
[4854.54 --> 4855.98]  Millions of cycles
[4855.98 --> 4856.68]  Per second
[4856.68 --> 4857.54]  A modern
[4857.54 --> 4858.12]  Processor
[4858.12 --> 4858.74]  Runs that
[4858.74 --> 4861.12]  Why does it
[4861.12 --> 4861.82]  Still take
[4861.82 --> 4862.86]  Just about
[4862.86 --> 4864.30]  Exactly as long
[4864.30 --> 4865.44]  To plug in an
[4865.44 --> 4866.18]  Ethernet cable
[4866.18 --> 4867.42]  And for it to
[4867.42 --> 4868.16]  Say you're
[4868.16 --> 4868.74]  Connected
[4868.74 --> 4871.66]  Well I still
[4871.66 --> 4872.28]  I still feel like
[4872.28 --> 4872.80]  It's probably because
[4872.80 --> 4873.50]  It's doing external
[4873.50 --> 4873.94]  Things
[4873.94 --> 4875.08]  Well no because
[4875.08 --> 4876.14]  No no I'm not even
[4876.14 --> 4876.78]  Talking about that
[4876.78 --> 4877.16]  Right now
[4877.16 --> 4878.00]  I'm talking about
[4878.00 --> 4878.54]  Like when you plug
[4878.54 --> 4879.40]  In an Ethernet cable
[4879.40 --> 4880.54]  Or plug in an
[4880.54 --> 4881.12]  Ethernet cable
[4881.12 --> 4881.54]  Yeah
[4881.54 --> 4883.20]  Okay it has to
[4883.20 --> 4883.90]  Negotiate the link
[4883.90 --> 4884.18]  Speed
[4884.18 --> 4885.04]  Sure but
[4885.04 --> 4886.48]  How long does
[4886.48 --> 4886.98]  That take
[4886.98 --> 4889.74]  So you're talking
[4889.74 --> 4890.78]  Even just your
[4890.78 --> 4891.42]  Local network
[4891.42 --> 4891.68]  Yeah
[4891.68 --> 4892.40]  So even just
[4892.40 --> 4892.82]  Detecting
[4892.82 --> 4893.86]  When you just
[4893.86 --> 4894.58]  Plug in a cable
[4894.58 --> 4896.00]  I haven't had
[4896.00 --> 4896.56]  This problem
[4896.56 --> 4897.62]  Until
[4897.62 --> 4899.46]  Actually my
[4899.46 --> 4900.36]  Work desktop
[4900.36 --> 4901.72]  My work desktop
[4901.72 --> 4902.52]  Is a huge pain
[4902.52 --> 4903.28]  Sometimes it just
[4903.28 --> 4904.10]  Will not accept
[4904.10 --> 4904.76]  An Ethernet connection
[4904.76 --> 4905.24]  I have to restart
[4905.24 --> 4905.78]  The whole computer
[4905.78 --> 4906.26]  And then it works
[4906.26 --> 4907.02]  You know what
[4907.02 --> 4907.68]  You might want to do
[4907.68 --> 4909.24]  Is manually set
[4909.24 --> 4910.28]  Your speed
[4910.28 --> 4910.74]  And duplex
[4910.74 --> 4912.88]  I've
[4912.88 --> 4914.00]  I've found that
[4914.00 --> 4914.98]  The two and a half
[4914.98 --> 4915.84]  Gig in
[4915.84 --> 4917.20]  In that office
[4917.20 --> 4918.04]  Is a little bit
[4918.04 --> 4918.42]  Sketchy
[4918.42 --> 4918.98]  And if I
[4918.98 --> 4919.70]  Depending on your
[4919.70 --> 4920.08]  Chip set
[4920.08 --> 4920.56]  If you set it
[4920.56 --> 4921.14]  To gigabit
[4921.14 --> 4922.44]  Then it'll just
[4922.44 --> 4924.54]  Work every time
[4924.54 --> 4925.48]  So
[4925.48 --> 4925.94]  Okay
[4925.94 --> 4926.62]  I'm answering
[4926.62 --> 4927.22]  My own question
[4927.22 --> 4928.14]  I do know
[4928.14 --> 4929.34]  Some of why
[4929.34 --> 4930.06]  It takes longer
[4930.06 --> 4931.46]  If for example
[4931.46 --> 4932.20]  There's some packet
[4932.20 --> 4932.62]  Lost
[4932.62 --> 4933.18]  Then it will
[4933.18 --> 4934.40]  It will take a while
[4934.40 --> 4935.54]  To figure out
[4935.54 --> 4936.52]  Okay what is
[4936.52 --> 4937.14]  The appropriate
[4937.14 --> 4937.88]  Link speed
[4937.88 --> 4938.90]  For this connection
[4938.90 --> 4940.58]  But there are
[4940.58 --> 4941.66]  A lot of things
[4941.66 --> 4942.64]  In the tech world
[4942.64 --> 4943.80]  That are operating
[4943.80 --> 4944.66]  At you know
[4944.66 --> 4946.26]  Millions of cycles
[4946.26 --> 4946.94]  Per second
[4946.94 --> 4948.46]  That seemingly
[4948.46 --> 4950.02]  Should be instantaneous
[4950.02 --> 4951.32]  But take
[4951.32 --> 4952.26]  A very
[4952.26 --> 4953.40]  Very long time
[4953.40 --> 4954.06]  Sometimes even
[4954.06 --> 4954.56]  Things that are
[4954.56 --> 4955.30]  Happening locally
[4955.30 --> 4956.56]  Extreme low priority
[4956.56 --> 4958.74]  Yeah
[4958.74 --> 4959.84]  Even if the CPU
[4959.84 --> 4960.42]  Is running away
[4960.42 --> 4960.78]  Faster
[4960.78 --> 4961.50]  It might not
[4961.50 --> 4961.90]  Be allowed
[4961.90 --> 4962.46]  To use any
[4962.46 --> 4962.82]  More than
[4962.82 --> 4963.14]  It used to
[4963.14 --> 4963.46]  Use in the
[4963.46 --> 4963.80]  Past
[4963.80 --> 4966.10]  But really
[4966.10 --> 4966.48]  Though
[4966.48 --> 4967.84]  Like if I
[4967.84 --> 4968.14]  Could just
[4968.14 --> 4968.72]  Have it happen
[4968.72 --> 4969.18]  Instantly
[4969.18 --> 4969.54]  I mean
[4969.54 --> 4969.90]  That would
[4969.90 --> 4970.14]  Be
[4970.14 --> 4970.86]  That would
[4970.86 --> 4971.34]  Be great
[4971.34 --> 4971.66]  Yeah
[4971.66 --> 4972.00]  But then
[4972.00 --> 4972.34]  If they
[4972.34 --> 4972.68]  If they
[4972.68 --> 4973.18]  Did that
[4973.18 --> 4973.80]  Every time
[4973.80 --> 4974.50]  You plug in
[4974.50 --> 4974.86]  A cable
[4974.86 --> 4975.38]  In your computer
[4975.38 --> 4975.90]  Just like
[4975.90 --> 4977.18]  Then they're
[4977.18 --> 4977.44]  Going to get
[4977.44 --> 4977.66]  A bunch
[4977.66 --> 4978.10]  Of complaints
[4978.10 --> 4978.76]  I'm sorry
[4978.76 --> 4979.10]  But I'm
[4979.10 --> 4979.64]  Not convinced
[4979.64 --> 4979.82]  It
[4979.82 --> 4981.68]  I'm not
[4981.68 --> 4982.10]  Convinced
[4982.10 --> 4982.94]  Like even
[4982.94 --> 4983.44]  Plugging in
[4983.44 --> 4983.76]  Like a
[4983.76 --> 4984.24]  Plugging in
[4984.24 --> 4984.50]  Like a
[4984.50 --> 4985.32]  USB drive
[4985.32 --> 4986.50]  Why is
[4986.50 --> 4987.04]  That not
[4987.04 --> 4989.18]  Instantaneous
[4989.18 --> 4990.00]  I feel like
[4990.00 --> 4990.76]  It is for me
[4990.76 --> 4992.22]  It's not
[4992.22 --> 4993.16]  Instantaneous
[4993.16 --> 4993.48]  It's pretty
[4993.48 --> 4993.90]  Fast
[4993.90 --> 4994.46]  It's
[4994.46 --> 4995.22]  Reasonable
[4995.22 --> 4996.34]  It's pretty
[4996.34 --> 4996.58]  Fast
[4996.58 --> 4996.92]  I'm not
[4996.92 --> 4997.24]  Convinced
[4997.24 --> 4997.58]  It's any
[4997.58 --> 4997.88]  Faster
[4997.88 --> 4998.14]  Than it
[4998.14 --> 4998.28]  Was
[4998.28 --> 4998.48]  Ten
[4998.48 --> 4998.68]  Years
[4998.68 --> 4998.86]  Ago
[4998.86 --> 4999.10]  Though
[4999.10 --> 4999.84]  Yeah
[4999.84 --> 5000.06]  Our
[5000.06 --> 5000.54]  Computers
[5000.54 --> 5000.86]  Are a
[5000.86 --> 5001.06]  Lot
[5001.06 --> 5001.46]  Faster
[5001.46 --> 5001.66]  Than
[5001.66 --> 5001.76]  They
[5001.76 --> 5001.90]  Were
[5001.90 --> 5002.14]  Ten
[5002.14 --> 5002.34]  Years
[5002.34 --> 5002.58]  Ago
[5002.58 --> 5003.08]  It's
[5003.08 --> 5003.26]  It's
[5003.26 --> 5003.44]  Kind
[5003.44 --> 5003.52]  Of
[5003.52 --> 5003.68]  Like
[5003.68 --> 5003.82]  How
[5003.82 --> 5003.98]  You
[5003.98 --> 5004.24]  You'll
[5004.24 --> 5004.38]  Play
[5004.38 --> 5004.50]  An
[5004.50 --> 5004.74]  Old
[5004.74 --> 5005.06]  Game
[5005.06 --> 5005.92]  And
[5005.92 --> 5006.04]  The
[5006.04 --> 5006.32]  Loading
[5006.32 --> 5006.60]  Times
[5006.60 --> 5006.86]  Still
[5006.86 --> 5007.20]  Suck
[5007.20 --> 5007.98]  You're
[5012.10 --> 5012.56]  Is
[5012.56 --> 5013.22]  Four
[5013.22 --> 5013.58]  Times
[5013.58 --> 5014.06]  Faster
[5014.06 --> 5014.68]  My
[5014.68 --> 5015.08]  Storage
[5015.08 --> 5015.54]  Is
[5015.54 --> 5016.54]  Forty
[5016.54 --> 5017.22]  Times
[5017.22 --> 5017.74]  Faster
[5017.74 --> 5020.46]  It
[5020.46 --> 5020.78]  Could
[5020.78 --> 5020.94]  Be
[5020.94 --> 5021.20]  Such
[5021.20 --> 5021.34]  A
[5021.34 --> 5021.62]  Huge
[5021.62 --> 5021.94]  Range
[5021.94 --> 5022.10]  Of
[5022.10 --> 5022.44]  Things
[5022.44 --> 5023.50]  It
[5023.50 --> 5023.64]  Could
[5023.64 --> 5023.86]  Be
[5023.86 --> 5024.84]  Time
[5024.84 --> 5025.22]  Outs
[5025.22 --> 5025.48]  It
[5025.48 --> 5025.60]  Could
[5025.60 --> 5025.92]  Be
[5025.92 --> 5026.68]  The
[5026.68 --> 5026.92]  Amount
[5026.92 --> 5027.06]  Of
[5027.06 --> 5027.28]  Things
[5027.28 --> 5027.50]  That
[5027.50 --> 5027.72]  Old
[5027.72 --> 5028.08]  Games
[5028.08 --> 5028.38]  Based
[5028.38 --> 5028.62]  Off
[5028.62 --> 5028.74]  Of
[5028.74 --> 5028.88]  Your
[5028.88 --> 5029.18]  System
[5029.18 --> 5029.60]  Clock
[5029.60 --> 5030.76]  It
[5030.76 --> 5030.90]  Could
[5030.90 --> 5031.14]  Be
[5031.14 --> 5031.38]  It
[5031.38 --> 5031.50]  Could
[5031.50 --> 5031.66]  Be
[5031.66 --> 5032.22]  Yeah
[5032.22 --> 5032.60]  That
[5032.60 --> 5032.80]  One
[5032.80 --> 5033.22]  Triggers
[5033.22 --> 5033.40]  Me
[5033.40 --> 5033.66]  So
[5033.66 --> 5033.88]  Hard
[5033.88 --> 5034.56]  Again
[5034.56 --> 5035.20]  Again
[5035.20 --> 5036.04]  Again
[5036.04 --> 5036.32]  I
[5036.32 --> 5036.54]  Do
[5036.54 --> 5036.78]  Know
[5036.78 --> 5037.04]  Some
[5037.04 --> 5037.14]  Of
[5037.14 --> 5037.24]  The
[5037.24 --> 5037.52]  Reasons
[5037.52 --> 5037.76]  For
[5037.76 --> 5037.98]  This
[5037.98 --> 5038.18]  It
[5038.18 --> 5038.48]  Just
[5038.48 --> 5039.40]  Bothers
[5039.40 --> 5039.76]  Me
[5039.76 --> 5040.44]  Probably
[5040.44 --> 5040.86]  More
[5040.86 --> 5041.06]  Than
[5042.10 --> 5042.24]  Things
[5042.24 --> 5042.40]  Where
[5042.40 --> 5042.86]  It
[5042.86 --> 5043.08]  Needs
[5043.08 --> 5043.24]  To
[5043.24 --> 5043.44]  Do
[5043.44 --> 5043.60]  A
[5043.60 --> 5043.84]  Thing
[5043.84 --> 5044.20]  And
[5044.20 --> 5044.96]  Make
[5044.96 --> 5045.10]  Sure
[5045.10 --> 5045.30]  That
[5045.30 --> 5045.78]  Thing
[5045.78 --> 5046.10]  Is
[5046.10 --> 5046.70]  Functioning
[5046.70 --> 5046.94]  For
[5046.94 --> 5047.12]  A
[5047.12 --> 5047.26]  Set
[5047.26 --> 5047.48]  Amount
[5047.48 --> 5047.60]  Of
[5047.60 --> 5047.84]  Time
[5047.84 --> 5048.08]  That's
[5048.08 --> 5048.16]  What
[5048.16 --> 5048.24]  I
[5048.24 --> 5048.40]  Mean
[5048.40 --> 5048.60]  By
[5048.60 --> 5049.52]  Time
[5049.52 --> 5049.78]  So
[5049.78 --> 5050.02]  The
[5050.02 --> 5050.22]  Time
[5050.22 --> 5050.40]  Outs
[5050.40 --> 5050.58]  Might
[5050.58 --> 5050.76]  Even
[5050.76 --> 5051.02]  Be
[5051.02 --> 5053.40]  Well
[5053.40 --> 5055.02]  Intentioned
[5055.02 --> 5055.24]  But
[5055.24 --> 5056.00]  Yeah
[5056.00 --> 5059.20]  Anyway
[5059.20 --> 5059.92]  In response
[5059.92 --> 5060.22]  To
[5060.22 --> 5060.56]  Troy
[5060.56 --> 5060.82]  I
[5060.82 --> 5061.02]  Would
[5061.02 --> 5061.34]  Take
[5061.34 --> 5061.66]  The
[5061.66 --> 5062.06]  Three
[5062.06 --> 5062.42]  Wired
[5062.42 --> 5062.82]  Ones
[5062.82 --> 5063.06]  So
[5063.06 --> 5063.32]  First
[5063.32 --> 5063.46]  I
[5063.46 --> 5063.54]  Would
[5063.54 --> 5063.64]  Do
[5063.64 --> 5063.76]  The
[5063.76 --> 5064.20]  2.4
[5064.20 --> 5064.42]  Giga
[5064.42 --> 5064.62]  Hits
[5064.62 --> 5064.84]  Thing
[5064.84 --> 5065.50]  Then
[5065.50 --> 5065.70]  I
[5065.70 --> 5065.84]  Would
[5065.84 --> 5066.02]  Take
[5066.02 --> 5066.18]  The
[5066.18 --> 5066.42]  Three
[5066.42 --> 5066.80]  Wired
[5066.80 --> 5067.18]  Ones
[5067.18 --> 5067.58]  And
[5067.58 --> 5067.70]  I
[5067.70 --> 5067.86]  Would
[5067.86 --> 5068.14]  Go
[5068.14 --> 5068.60]  Into
[5068.60 --> 5069.02]  Your
[5069.02 --> 5069.42]  Sonos
[5069.42 --> 5069.76]  App
[5069.76 --> 5070.50]  And
[5070.50 --> 5071.28]  Manually
[5071.28 --> 5071.88]  Disable
[5071.88 --> 5072.28]  Wireless
[5072.28 --> 5072.58]  On
[5072.58 --> 5072.80]  Them
[5072.80 --> 5073.24]  So
[5073.24 --> 5073.40]  That
[5073.40 --> 5073.54]  You
[5073.54 --> 5073.78]  Know
[5073.78 --> 5074.36]  For
[5074.36 --> 5074.82]  Sure
[5074.82 --> 5075.24]  That

[5075.42 --> 5075.56]  Are
[5075.56 --> 5076.12]  Actually
[5076.12 --> 5076.76]  Using
[5076.76 --> 5076.96]  The
[5076.96 --> 5077.24]  Wire
[5077.24 --> 5077.78]  And
[5077.78 --> 5077.94]  Then
[5077.94 --> 5078.16]  That
[5078.16 --> 5078.44]  Will
[5078.44 --> 5078.76]  That
[5078.76 --> 5078.90]  Will
[5078.90 --> 5079.20]  Hopefully
[5079.20 --> 5079.44]  Mean
[5079.44 --> 5079.54]  You
[5079.54 --> 5079.66]  Will
[5079.66 --> 5079.82]  Have
[5079.82 --> 5080.36]  Fewer
[5080.36 --> 5080.84]  Devices

[5410.02 --> 5410.32]  Here
[5410.32 --> 5413.00]  Uh
[5413.00 --> 5413.38]  Okay

[5413.70 --> 5413.84]  Do
[5413.84 --> 5413.90]  You

[5417.22 --> 5417.58]  I
[5417.58 --> 5417.82]  Think
[5417.82 --> 5417.94]  I'll
[5417.94 --> 5418.08]  Just
[5418.08 --> 5418.40]  Read
[5418.40 --> 5418.68]  The
[5418.68 --> 5419.12]  Thing
[5419.12 --> 5419.26]  And
[5419.26 --> 5419.38]  Then
[5419.38 --> 5419.80]  I'll
[5419.80 --> 5420.02]  Start
[5420.02 --> 5420.48]  Unpacking
[5420.48 --> 5420.68]  After
[5420.68 --> 5420.90]  That
[5420.90 --> 5421.38]  Google
[5421.38 --> 5421.56]  Has
[5421.56 --> 5422.00]  Temporarily
[5422.00 --> 5422.48]  Removed

[5424.76 --> 5425.20]  Following
[5425.20 --> 5425.56]  A

[5425.98 --> 5426.38]  Reported
[5426.38 --> 5426.74]  Problem
[5426.74 --> 5426.94]  Where
[5426.94 --> 5427.02]  It
[5427.02 --> 5427.14]  Would
[5427.14 --> 5427.52]  Refuse
[5427.52 --> 5427.66]  To
[5427.66 --> 5427.98]  Generate

[5429.14 --> 5429.38]  Or
[5429.38 --> 5429.90]  Latinos
[5429.90 --> 5430.56]  And
[5430.56 --> 5430.74]  Would
[5430.74 --> 5431.22]  Insert
[5431.22 --> 5431.44]  The
[5431.44 --> 5431.92]  Keyword
[5431.92 --> 5432.82]  Diverse
[5432.82 --> 5433.32]  Into
[5433.32 --> 5433.92]  Unrelated
[5433.92 --> 5434.42]  Prompts
[5434.42 --> 5435.14]  In
[5435.14 --> 5435.16]  In
[5435.16 --> 5435.18]  In
[5435.18 --> 5435.24]  Coming
[5435.24 --> 5435.28]  In
[5435.28 --> 5439.12]  Anything
[5439.12 --> 5441.42]  Next
[5441.42 --> 5443.40]  Oh
[5443.40 --> 5443.88]  Quality
[5443.88 --> 5444.36]  That
[5444.36 --> 5448.32]  Were
[5448.32 --> 5449.52]  The
[5449.52 --> 5451.04]  Need
[5451.04 --> 5456.48]  issue with early image generation models, namely that they would overweigh the most common
[5456.48 --> 5462.06]  stereotypical images in their databases, leading to a generator that would only produce men when
[5462.06 --> 5468.16]  asked for a scientist or would produce a white doctor even when explicitly asked for a black
[5468.16 --> 5475.16]  doctor. Google has apologized for the overcorrection. Google likewise appears to have a moderation
[5475.16 --> 5483.12]  system based on spelling. Brilliant. Meaning that it is easily bypassed by intentional mistyping of
[5483.12 --> 5488.84]  a forbidden word. Discussion question. Is there a correct amount of stereotyping that an AI should
[5488.84 --> 5493.80]  use? Shouldn't Google be able to find a less dumb way of fixing these issues? I think the issue
[5493.80 --> 5506.26]  specifically, if you want to ask me, is not that it... If it was like more likely to do a certain thing,
[5507.20 --> 5515.14]  but would do a range of things, I think that's fine. Yeah, except that a lot of these prompts,
[5515.28 --> 5521.44]  because generating more than one image is very expensive. A lot of these prompts that I've used
[5521.44 --> 5526.50]  in the past only spit out one at a time anyway. I believe Gemini tends to do four. Sure, but...
[5527.82 --> 5533.30]  Okay, if we're talking about Gemini specifically, then I see your solution being, okay, you could have
[5533.30 --> 5540.00]  three that just use the images that it's trained on, and then one that's kind of a, like, shot in the
[5540.00 --> 5547.72]  dark. Whereas for any of the ones that only spit out one image, if it gave me... I mean, well, really...
[5547.72 --> 5556.88]  Especially top right and bottom left. If it gave me either of those, I mean, this...
[5556.88 --> 5559.68]  Bottom right's also... Well, maybe he's the soldier. I don't know.
[5559.98 --> 5560.98]  I mean, she's wearing a uniform.
[5561.76 --> 5562.14]  Right.
[5562.76 --> 5563.00]  Yep.
[5564.26 --> 5568.50]  I mean, well, this is just a lot to unpack in general.
[5568.60 --> 5570.72]  It's also like an American-ish looking soldier.
[5570.96 --> 5571.26]  Yeah.
[5571.46 --> 5572.24]  That's like down...
[5572.24 --> 5573.16]  She seems to be helping.
[5573.16 --> 5573.64]  Yeah.
[5573.96 --> 5574.16]  So...
[5574.94 --> 5578.70]  Her storage pack that's on her back hip, I think, is upside down.
[5578.82 --> 5579.50]  I like her hair.
[5579.60 --> 5580.14]  Which is kind of sick.
[5580.62 --> 5582.00]  It's just not here.
[5582.66 --> 5583.16]  But it's here.
[5584.12 --> 5584.32]  Yeah.
[5584.42 --> 5585.30]  And it's here.
[5585.66 --> 5585.96]  Yeah.
[5586.08 --> 5587.00]  But not here.
[5587.26 --> 5587.56]  Yeah.
[5589.74 --> 5590.76]  Yeah, it's tough.
[5590.76 --> 5593.10]  But I think...
[5593.10 --> 5593.76]  I think...
[5593.76 --> 5604.72]  I think forcing terms ends up being a problem because it overcorrects, as we have just seen.
[5604.88 --> 5608.82]  But on the other hand, you can't just generate men when you search for doctor.
[5609.06 --> 5609.36]  Totally.
[5609.80 --> 5612.76]  But if you search specifically for...
[5614.80 --> 5615.42]  Yeah, yeah.
[5615.42 --> 5620.42]  So, like, the unaltered one is also too far, though, because, again...
[5620.42 --> 5623.70]  Internal hair routing ducting in the uniform.
[5624.02 --> 5624.34]  They would...
[5624.34 --> 5624.82]  They would...
[5624.82 --> 5627.16]  They would overweigh common stereotypical images.
[5627.16 --> 5630.10]  She pulled a Mulan because women weren't allowed to serve in Germany then anyway.
[5630.34 --> 5630.90]  Yeah, yeah.
[5631.38 --> 5631.78]  Perfect.
[5632.52 --> 5636.54]  They would overweigh the most common stereotypical images in the databases, leading to a generator
[5636.54 --> 5641.24]  that would produce men when asked for science, or, this is the key point in my opinion,
[5641.62 --> 5644.90]  would produce a white doctor even when explicitly asked for a black doctor.
[5644.90 --> 5647.82]  So, the original way it was going was also wrong.
[5648.12 --> 5648.42]  Yes.
[5648.54 --> 5651.40]  Because you're not even getting specifically what you asked for out of it.
[5651.56 --> 5656.70]  So, they needed to correct off of that because the original version is just bad.
[5657.64 --> 5659.84]  But this is just too far.
[5660.96 --> 5661.90]  I think...
[5661.90 --> 5662.90]  I think...
[5663.90 --> 5669.90]  If you weren't already thinking this, I think this is quite a slap in the face for...
[5669.90 --> 5672.90]  The observation that...
[5673.62 --> 5679.32]  This is a very in-your-face, obvious version of this, but all of these systems are going
[5679.32 --> 5681.10]  to be tuned to something.
[5681.82 --> 5683.54]  Whatever company's version of this...
[5683.54 --> 5683.66]  Yep.
[5683.74 --> 5688.02]  ...that you're using is going to be tuning it to serve you certain types of things.
[5688.20 --> 5692.22]  And you need to understand that your worldview or your exposure or whatever else is going
[5692.22 --> 5692.82]  to be...
[5692.82 --> 5693.82]  And just wait...
[5693.82 --> 5694.14]  Painted.
[5694.26 --> 5696.66]  ...until they're tuning it specifically for you.
[5697.00 --> 5697.32]  Yeah.
[5697.88 --> 5702.68]  So, they'll creep your Facebook and be like, oh, well, you are...
[5702.68 --> 5703.56]  You're a super...
[5703.56 --> 5705.02]  I'm going to pick a...
[5705.02 --> 5706.78]  No, I'm not going to pick anything controversial.
[5707.48 --> 5709.32]  I will pick mops.
[5710.74 --> 5711.88]  You were really into mops?
[5712.04 --> 5712.66]  You are...
[5712.66 --> 5713.52]  You are pro...
[5713.52 --> 5714.24]  You're a mop enthusiast?
[5714.24 --> 5719.90]  You are pro the mops that were already there or you are pro the brooms that came later.
[5720.56 --> 5720.86]  You know?
[5721.00 --> 5722.42]  Whatever it is.
[5723.14 --> 5730.58]  And so, when you search for, you know, a patriotic soldier, it's going to show you mop soldiers
[5730.58 --> 5732.20]  or whatever else.
[5732.74 --> 5737.72]  Whereas if you, you know, if you are more on the side of the brooms, then it's going to
[5737.72 --> 5740.34]  show you broom soldiers, you know...
[5740.34 --> 5740.56]  Right.
[5740.56 --> 5744.76]  So, if I searched soldier, for example, maybe it would give me a Canadian soldier.
[5745.30 --> 5745.70]  Exactly.
[5745.86 --> 5751.24]  Because it has the context that I'm maybe in Canada or maybe it knows that I'm a Canadian
[5751.24 --> 5752.60]  citizen or something like that.
[5752.60 --> 5756.66]  And remember, with how much they know about you, it might give you a Canadian soldier...
[5756.66 --> 5757.90]  It might give you a Canadian sniper.
[5758.86 --> 5759.08]  Yeah.
[5759.36 --> 5767.14]  Because you'd be more into marksmanship than necessarily, you know, being a tank tank operator,
[5767.36 --> 5768.58]  gunner, whatever.
[5768.58 --> 5770.48]  There's a range of roles in there, but yeah.
[5770.48 --> 5770.60]  Sure.
[5770.78 --> 5770.94]  Yeah.
[5771.22 --> 5773.20]  But part of it, a member of a tank crew.
[5773.64 --> 5773.66]  Yeah.
[5773.66 --> 5774.68]  Like, I...
[5774.68 --> 5775.82]  That would be my guess.
[5775.96 --> 5776.36]  It might be...
[5776.36 --> 5779.16]  And it depends on what the...
[5780.22 --> 5782.08]  What's driving a tanky...
[5782.08 --> 5782.60]  Very nice, Dan.
[5784.90 --> 5788.64]  It depends on what's driving the value for this thing.
[5788.76 --> 5791.34]  So, a conversation that we were talking about earlier where you're the product.
[5792.18 --> 5792.76]  It's like, okay.
[5793.62 --> 5794.74]  So, what are you serving me?
[5794.88 --> 5796.14]  Are there product placements?
[5796.14 --> 5796.48]  Yeah.
[5796.48 --> 5801.40]  Is it going to give you a Canadian soldier using a particular rifle with a particular
[5801.40 --> 5802.50]  scope on it?
[5802.58 --> 5802.82]  Yeah.
[5802.92 --> 5807.98]  Is it going to try to push me into, you know, recruitment for the military somehow?
[5807.98 --> 5808.98]  Ugh.
[5808.98 --> 5810.98]  Is it...
[5810.98 --> 5811.42]  Is it...
[5811.42 --> 5816.20]  Is it only going to show soldiers that, like, look very, you know, successful and clean
[5816.20 --> 5816.44]  cut?
[5816.44 --> 5818.40]  Is it going to show soldiers that look like you?
[5818.70 --> 5818.94]  Maybe.
[5819.20 --> 5821.18]  So you can see yourself in that more easily?
[5821.18 --> 5822.18]  Like, there's...
[5822.18 --> 5825.34]  There's lots of ways that these things can be tuned.
[5825.38 --> 5828.18]  Man, we are so close to dystopia that, like...
[5828.18 --> 5829.34]  We're basically here.
[5829.46 --> 5829.66]  Yeah.
[5830.18 --> 5830.70]  Yeah.
[5831.02 --> 5833.18]  So, like, this is something that...
[5833.76 --> 5840.44]  Just because this one was super obvious, if this goes away, the root problem is very
[5840.44 --> 5841.68]  much still here.
[5842.36 --> 5847.18]  Just because it might not be spitting out images of...
[5847.18 --> 5849.36]  And they can hide it.
[5849.36 --> 5852.92]  They can hide that root problem by doing what we're talking about.
[5853.04 --> 5853.12]  Yeah.
[5853.32 --> 5856.80]  By tuning it to output something that you expect.
[5856.98 --> 5860.72]  And these inputs are things that you will give them.
[5861.02 --> 5866.12]  You are going to give them willingly, helping them build their profile for you because it
[5866.12 --> 5868.80]  will make the tools work better and we like these tools and they're convenient.
[5869.06 --> 5873.60]  So it'll spit out nine images for you and it'll say, which one do you think was the
[5873.60 --> 5874.00]  best one?
[5874.04 --> 5875.26]  And it'll remember which one you selected.
[5875.26 --> 5876.40]  And it'll be like the Arian one.
[5876.40 --> 5879.50]  And it'll be like, all right, good to know.
[5880.68 --> 5882.18]  And you'll get more of that.
[5882.56 --> 5885.96]  You need to start self-analyzing with some of the results you start getting.
[5886.78 --> 5890.56]  You just type in soldier and it just gives you a 1943 German soldier and you're like,
[5890.64 --> 5890.78]  oh.
[5892.08 --> 5892.52]  Oh.
[5892.52 --> 5895.48]  Who's wearing a jersey that says Lafreniere on the back.
[5895.48 --> 5895.98]  It's all over.
[5896.38 --> 5897.08]  Oh no.
[5898.56 --> 5899.32]  What's happening?
[5901.16 --> 5902.02]  Sounds like Google to me.
[5902.12 --> 5902.38]  Yeah.
[5903.16 --> 5903.56]  Absolutely.
[5903.92 --> 5904.20]  Yeah.
[5904.20 --> 5904.52]  Exactly.
[5905.12 --> 5905.84]  But I think...
[5905.84 --> 5906.94]  Don't forget about Meta.
[5907.20 --> 5907.84]  Even more likely...
[5907.84 --> 5908.36]  And Amazon.
[5908.94 --> 5910.64]  More easy for them to be nefarious.
[5910.64 --> 5911.66]  And the US Army.
[5912.68 --> 5913.68]  And other armies.
[5913.94 --> 5914.16]  Yeah.
[5914.48 --> 5915.68]  Remember when the US Army was on Twitch?
[5916.34 --> 5917.02]  That was a horrible thing.
[5917.48 --> 5917.72]  Yeah.
[5917.72 --> 5921.20]  I mean, are they not anymore?
[5921.32 --> 5922.08]  I was just going to check.
[5922.18 --> 5922.32]  Yeah.
[5924.40 --> 5925.50]  Wouldn't surprise me.
[5926.20 --> 5927.44]  US Army Esports.
[5930.96 --> 5932.04]  Four years ago.
[5932.60 --> 5933.08]  Maybe they're not.
[5934.64 --> 5935.08]  Schedule.
[5935.22 --> 5935.64]  Here we go.
[5936.64 --> 5937.02]  Oh, no.
[5937.12 --> 5938.24]  Last stream two years ago.
[5938.24 --> 5938.48]  Okay.
[5938.58 --> 5941.06]  So this particular thing is no longer a thing.
[5941.16 --> 5942.10]  But don't kid yourself.
[5942.92 --> 5944.24]  I'm sure they're around somehow.
[5944.36 --> 5945.36]  It's definitely a thing.
[5945.36 --> 5950.72]  I had no idea how into merchandising the US Army was.
[5951.26 --> 5951.38]  Yeah.
[5951.50 --> 5953.24]  We have a video coming shortly.
[5953.38 --> 5954.92]  I actually reviewed the edit for it.
[5954.96 --> 5956.34]  It's a great video.
[5956.62 --> 5963.90]  I just reviewed the edit before WAN show today on these kind of wannabe razor peripherals.
[5964.00 --> 5966.98]  We actually showed them on the show a couple weeks ago, I think.
[5966.98 --> 5976.80]  And one of the other things that this company that makes these rip off razor peripherals does is they make US Army branded stuff.
[5977.44 --> 5984.32]  And as part of that rabbit hole, we went looking for all the things with the US Army co-branding on them.
[5985.08 --> 5985.64]  What?
[5986.20 --> 5986.46]  Yeah.
[5986.46 --> 5990.86]  There's anything and everything with United States Army co-branding.
[5990.92 --> 5992.12]  It's absolutely wild.
[5992.42 --> 5993.12]  Oh, there's tons of stuff.
[5993.32 --> 5996.42]  They should pay you to wear it, you know, because you served or something.
[5996.72 --> 5999.34]  Not you pay them to...
[5999.34 --> 6001.12]  I mean, I don't know.
[6001.26 --> 6004.92]  Maybe I'm missing something here, but good gravy.
[6006.24 --> 6007.92]  I wonder, like...
[6007.92 --> 6009.14]  Are you okay?
[6009.44 --> 6010.26]  I don't know.
[6010.42 --> 6011.58]  Do you have acid reflux?
[6011.72 --> 6012.86]  I'm trying to hold it together.
[6012.86 --> 6014.58]  Do you need a bucket?
[6014.64 --> 6016.02]  Man, they're not even cheap.
[6016.46 --> 6017.00]  Look at that.
[6017.10 --> 6017.26]  Yeah.
[6017.86 --> 6018.62]  Oh, man.
[6019.10 --> 6020.14]  $40 t-shirt.
[6021.16 --> 6025.08]  It's amazing how often we take flack for the pricing on our store.
[6025.74 --> 6026.78]  Oh, my goodness.
[6026.78 --> 6027.36]  Sorry, guys.
[6027.76 --> 6028.78]  Our shirts are $20.
[6030.42 --> 6031.56]  Like, we...
[6031.56 --> 6032.20]  I don't know.
[6032.26 --> 6033.06]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[6033.56 --> 6033.98]  The point is...
[6033.98 --> 6034.72]  Oh, it got more expensive.
[6034.82 --> 6035.12]  $44.
[6035.52 --> 6036.08]  Oh, hold on.
[6036.14 --> 6036.74]  Back to your laptop.
[6037.12 --> 6038.46]  Is that because there's print on the back?
[6038.54 --> 6039.34]  Is there no...
[6039.34 --> 6040.08]  Yeah, I don't think there's...
[6040.08 --> 6043.96]  Print on the back does cost more, and that's a pretty reasonable upcharge for double-sided printing.
[6043.96 --> 6047.38]  It adds a complete extra step with an additional screen.
[6048.16 --> 6050.36]  Okay, they've got a $19.
[6050.82 --> 6052.18]  Well, what's a PT shirt?
[6053.36 --> 6054.04]  Personal training.
[6054.84 --> 6055.50]  Oh, okay.
[6055.66 --> 6055.88]  Okay.
[6056.38 --> 6058.02]  There's some reasonably priced stuff here.
[6058.06 --> 6060.08]  I have no idea what the quality of any of this is.
[6060.56 --> 6062.44]  What is armygearus.com, though?
[6062.44 --> 6063.02]  Is this official?
[6063.14 --> 6064.40]  Some of their discounts get pretty fat.
[6064.48 --> 6066.22]  I don't think this is actually...
[6066.22 --> 6066.76]  I have no idea.
[6066.76 --> 6068.76]  No, this isn't the army, Luke.
[6069.16 --> 6069.76]  I don't know, dude.
[6069.84 --> 6070.72]  Man, you're...
[6070.72 --> 6072.48]  Are you like...
[6072.48 --> 6074.70]  No, it's army co-branded, I think, right?
[6074.84 --> 6076.02]  I don't know.
[6076.20 --> 6077.84]  That looks pretty army co-branded to me.
[6078.82 --> 6080.44]  I have no idea.
[6081.72 --> 6084.30]  This Under Armour, Duty Honor, Country T.
[6085.08 --> 6087.04]  Duty Honor, Country...
[6087.04 --> 6088.86]  Did they just take every keyword?
[6089.34 --> 6093.52]  I think that's one of their tagline things on their coins and stuff.
[6093.62 --> 6094.04]  Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[6094.04 --> 6096.88]  So I think there would usually be like a symbol between each word or something.
[6097.00 --> 6098.58]  People are saying that is the logo.
[6098.90 --> 6099.36]  So, okay.
[6099.46 --> 6101.36]  Yeah, that is definitely the US Army logo.
[6101.56 --> 6102.14]  That's why I was saying...
[6102.14 --> 6102.74]  PT, physical training.
[6103.58 --> 6104.12]  Oh, there you go.
[6104.22 --> 6105.34]  Not personal training?
[6105.44 --> 6105.72]  Sure, whatever.
[6106.66 --> 6108.42]  I knew it meant like going to work out.
[6108.68 --> 6110.76]  NATO apparently streamed a gaming tournament,
[6111.06 --> 6113.48]  but the Twitch channel is no longer there for some reason.
[6113.76 --> 6114.08]  Wild.
[6115.30 --> 6117.46]  Anywho, why don't we jump into...
[6117.46 --> 6118.54]  We've got a few merch messages.
[6118.66 --> 6119.38]  Dan, want to hit us?
[6120.10 --> 6120.66]  Yeah, sure thing.
[6121.08 --> 6122.18]  Let's see here.
[6122.18 --> 6124.28]  Maybe we should fetch Luca Bucket at some point.
[6124.42 --> 6124.76]  I think he's...
[6124.76 --> 6126.60]  I did offer him earlier, so...
[6126.60 --> 6127.46]  I'll be fine.
[6127.72 --> 6128.12]  Okay.
[6128.96 --> 6130.64]  Yeah, I got two here for you.
[6130.96 --> 6131.34]  Hi, DLL.
[6131.52 --> 6135.24]  The American Red Cross released a VR training app for lifeguards,
[6135.34 --> 6137.16]  but it needs the Quest 2 or 3.
[6137.64 --> 6140.46]  Linus, do you think this would have helped you become a better lifeguard,
[6140.54 --> 6141.68]  and can it help others?
[6142.08 --> 6145.12]  I think it could have helped with repetitive training exercises,
[6145.12 --> 6148.28]  like going through the motions, literally,
[6148.86 --> 6151.58]  of working on CPR compressions,
[6151.90 --> 6155.76]  or to practice,
[6156.06 --> 6159.80]  like if they have a simulated pool that you can stand next to
[6159.80 --> 6162.78]  and try to spot distressed swimmers and stuff like that.
[6162.88 --> 6162.96]  Oh, yeah.
[6162.96 --> 6163.88]  Try to get your...
[6163.88 --> 6165.28]  Make it a game.
[6165.36 --> 6166.26]  Try to get your time down.
[6166.40 --> 6166.82]  Yeah.
[6166.82 --> 6168.74]  Like how fast you recognize a problem.
[6168.90 --> 6171.24]  I could see stuff like that being kind of useful,
[6171.24 --> 6176.24]  but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of can you actually haul someone's,
[6176.70 --> 6179.10]  you know, soggy butt out of a pool?
[6179.64 --> 6180.00]  No.
[6180.14 --> 6180.78]  You need real life.
[6180.96 --> 6182.86]  You need to actually train.
[6183.02 --> 6185.34]  So if I was doing a training program,
[6185.34 --> 6187.28]  and I had homework for the weekend
[6187.28 --> 6190.68]  where I had to get my response time down to,
[6190.88 --> 6192.34]  you know, three seconds to spot,
[6192.44 --> 6193.04]  or whatever,
[6193.16 --> 6194.96]  yeah, I could see it being kind of useful for that.
[6195.10 --> 6197.92]  I also think if you're doing stuff like if you're training,
[6198.44 --> 6200.28]  once you've gotten them out of the water,
[6201.24 --> 6201.92]  aid,
[6202.58 --> 6205.02]  I don't know what different forms of that that would come up in,
[6205.10 --> 6207.36]  but if it's like training that you do with a dummy,
[6207.86 --> 6210.38]  if you could still do that training with a dummy,
[6210.50 --> 6211.68]  but while VR strapped in,
[6211.74 --> 6212.72]  so that's like more realistic,
[6213.36 --> 6217.34]  I think it might help desensitize in situations where it might be rough.
[6217.46 --> 6218.44]  Yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[6219.12 --> 6221.64]  Another thing I could see it be really being really useful for
[6221.64 --> 6223.84]  with mixed reality is things like,
[6223.84 --> 6227.64]  you know, landmarking or like,
[6227.70 --> 6228.08]  okay,
[6228.20 --> 6229.58]  one of the things that you need to do
[6229.58 --> 6232.90]  if you're going to do a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
[6233.14 --> 6234.92]  like breathing assistance is,
[6235.26 --> 6237.28]  is you have to tilt the head back.
[6237.72 --> 6240.42]  And so if it would tell you like,
[6240.52 --> 6240.60]  hey,
[6240.64 --> 6242.12]  you didn't tilt back far enough
[6242.12 --> 6243.28]  because it's actually monitoring,
[6243.40 --> 6244.70]  it could show you like,
[6244.82 --> 6245.66]  like a,
[6245.72 --> 6245.86]  you know,
[6245.86 --> 6248.90]  like a green shade for how far back the head,
[6248.96 --> 6250.94]  the head needs to go in order to open up the airway
[6250.94 --> 6251.62]  or something like that.
[6251.84 --> 6252.10]  Sure.
[6252.10 --> 6253.42]  I could see it being very useful.
[6253.78 --> 6255.88]  I haven't used their software though.
[6255.88 --> 6258.02]  I have no idea if it does any of what I just said.
[6258.06 --> 6258.98]  It could just be stupid.
[6259.12 --> 6259.62]  I'm not sure.
[6260.10 --> 6260.66]  But yeah,
[6260.70 --> 6261.16]  absolutely.
[6261.34 --> 6261.62]  I mean,
[6262.02 --> 6267.36]  commercial applications for VR are heavily,
[6267.56 --> 6270.70]  heavily training focused.
[6270.70 --> 6272.42]  one of the things that,
[6272.42 --> 6272.88]  um,
[6273.52 --> 6273.92]  oh,
[6274.12 --> 6274.52]  bananas.
[6274.68 --> 6275.26]  Who was it?
[6275.62 --> 6275.78]  Uh,
[6275.78 --> 6275.90]  yeah.
[6275.90 --> 6278.76]  One of the things Intel showed back when I checked out their fab
[6278.76 --> 6280.28]  a while back was,
[6280.28 --> 6280.84]  uh,
[6280.84 --> 6286.24]  maintenance on the machines is it's Microsoft hollow lens driven.
[6286.34 --> 6286.72]  Yeah.
[6286.80 --> 6289.10]  So it'll just show you like,
[6289.14 --> 6293.54]  you could be a complete nobody off the street and you could perform
[6293.54 --> 6297.90]  maintenance on one of these multimillion dollar machines just by putting
[6297.90 --> 6298.68]  on a hollow lens.
[6298.68 --> 6299.22]  And it'll be like,
[6299.26 --> 6299.48]  okay,
[6299.58 --> 6303.60]  go over there and get that toolkit and then open up that toolkit,
[6303.88 --> 6304.38]  uh,
[6304.38 --> 6306.04]  grab this and you pick it up.
[6306.08 --> 6306.40]  It's like,
[6306.44 --> 6306.62]  nope,
[6306.64 --> 6307.34]  not that one.
[6307.42 --> 6307.82]  Like,
[6308.04 --> 6313.86]  like you really any monkey with training could like,
[6314.52 --> 6314.90]  yeah,
[6315.00 --> 6316.54]  hollow lens is totally a thing.
[6316.54 --> 6318.16]  It's just not a thing in the consumer space.
[6318.52 --> 6318.92]  Um,
[6319.06 --> 6320.72]  military has applications for it as well.
[6320.86 --> 6321.10]  Yep.
[6322.84 --> 6323.40]  All right,
[6323.42 --> 6324.02]  Dan hit us.
[6325.52 --> 6326.36]  Sure thing.
[6327.10 --> 6327.52]  Hi,
[6327.56 --> 6327.76]  DLL.
[6327.76 --> 6327.98]  Well,
[6327.98 --> 6330.20]  I work in live theater lighting.
[6330.70 --> 6333.06]  Tungsten bulbs are being banned by the government.
[6333.58 --> 6340.54]  The alternative is LEDs that cost $10,000 and up to achieve a similar quality light.
[6340.76 --> 6342.50]  Will small theater survive this?
[6342.72 --> 6342.98]  Yes.
[6343.66 --> 6344.06]  Um,
[6344.06 --> 6346.16]  but not be not,
[6347.40 --> 6353.54]  not with products that are available today necessarily.
[6353.88 --> 6359.36]  The advancements in LED lighting over the last 10 years have been a thing to behold.
[6359.36 --> 6363.56]  I had this conversation with someone on set a little while ago and I kind of went,
[6363.70 --> 6363.92]  okay,
[6364.34 --> 6366.54]  let's look at all the major tech categories,
[6366.68 --> 6367.24]  CPU,
[6367.72 --> 6368.18]  GPU,
[6368.80 --> 6370.10]  networking.
[6370.10 --> 6370.82]  Um,
[6371.54 --> 6374.68]  and there's some solid arguments to be made for a lot of those,
[6374.88 --> 6376.66]  a lot of those categories in terms of,
[6376.72 --> 6376.82]  you know,
[6376.82 --> 6379.56]  what's advanced the most over the last 10 years.
[6379.76 --> 6380.66]  And I was like,
[6381.72 --> 6382.44]  and then I'm going to,
[6382.50 --> 6384.54]  I'm going to tell me what you think is advanced the most.
[6384.60 --> 6387.32]  And then I'm going to surprise you with my answer and see if we can kind of,
[6387.38 --> 6390.04]  we play these kinds of games when we're in between takes and stuff like that.
[6390.04 --> 6391.12]  And they,
[6391.20 --> 6392.08]  they gave their answers.
[6392.20 --> 6392.76]  And I was like,
[6392.76 --> 6394.40]  lighting.
[6395.30 --> 6396.18]  And they're like,
[6397.72 --> 6399.18]  huh?
[6399.90 --> 6402.42]  Because there are certainly ways that,
[6402.50 --> 6402.68]  you know,
[6402.72 --> 6403.08]  even,
[6403.24 --> 6404.70]  even a stupid,
[6404.84 --> 6405.00]  you know,
[6405.10 --> 6406.86]  Intel 14 nanometer plus,
[6406.96 --> 6407.14]  plus,
[6407.26 --> 6412.00]  plus refresh has more advanced technology in,
[6412.08 --> 6412.92]  in it than,
[6413.10 --> 6413.58]  than,
[6413.72 --> 6414.02]  you know,
[6414.08 --> 6416.74]  one generation of lighting and to,
[6416.82 --> 6418.78]  to the next three generations of lighting potentially.
[6418.78 --> 6426.96]  But in terms of what has made an impact on our business and in terms of the,
[6426.96 --> 6431.70]  the change in quality and cost in that time,
[6431.88 --> 6437.86]  I don't know if anything touches led lighting and like Veritasium had that video
[6437.86 --> 6443.42]  that went viral recently on the challenges of developing the blue led and how just
[6443.42 --> 6445.94]  leds were up against this wall forever.
[6446.28 --> 6447.98]  And then development happened.
[6447.98 --> 6449.56]  And like wildly fast.
[6449.56 --> 6453.54]  And that wild fast development is very much still happening.
[6453.72 --> 6454.96]  Like in the last 10 years,
[6455.06 --> 6457.00]  we've gone from flora.
[6457.16 --> 6463.02]  We've gone from fluorescence being dominant to leds being not just dominant,
[6463.02 --> 6470.82]  but now you can change the color temperatures on them on the fly because these controllers have come down in cost by so much.
[6470.82 --> 6471.50]  Um,
[6471.50 --> 6475.44]  you can have arrays of LEDs at different color temperatures and they can do,
[6475.60 --> 6481.24]  they can do mixing or they can switch between one or the other or both the brightness of them,
[6481.30 --> 6482.46]  the efficiency of them,
[6482.54 --> 6485.08]  everything is getting absolutely incredible.
[6485.08 --> 6486.30]  And at the same time,
[6486.30 --> 6488.70]  costs are plummeting.
[6488.70 --> 6496.10]  the first lights we ever bought were fluorescence because that was the only thing that had a CRI or basically like,
[6496.16 --> 6496.32]  uh,
[6496.32 --> 6496.50]  like,
[6496.60 --> 6496.76]  uh,
[6496.76 --> 6497.02]  like,
[6497.12 --> 6497.60]  um,
[6497.60 --> 6500.44]  an accurate enough color,
[6500.44 --> 6501.08]  uh,
[6501.08 --> 6502.04]  to use for filming.
[6502.54 --> 6504.76]  And then over the next few years,
[6504.90 --> 6506.44]  led lights showed up,
[6506.44 --> 6511.66]  but they were prohibitively expensive over the following three to five years.
[6511.82 --> 6514.08]  LEDs got cheap.
[6514.56 --> 6515.08]  Like,
[6515.24 --> 6518.76]  why would we buy anything else cheap?
[6518.80 --> 6520.90]  Nothing else makes any sense cheap.
[6520.90 --> 6523.74]  And I just don't really see it slowing down.
[6524.24 --> 6524.48]  Um,
[6524.54 --> 6526.28]  so in a bit,
[6526.66 --> 6528.88]  and I'm not going to tell you exactly when,
[6529.08 --> 6530.10]  but in a bit,
[6530.18 --> 6530.32]  no,
[6530.42 --> 6535.50]  I absolutely foresee those traditional lights being replaceable with LEDs.
[6535.50 --> 6540.54]  And I don't know where you are and when exactly these bands are going into effect.
[6540.66 --> 6549.08]  There have certainly been some short sighted bands that have destroyed entire industries and have made absolutely no sense.
[6549.08 --> 6549.46]  I mean,
[6549.96 --> 6550.20]  uh,
[6550.20 --> 6556.30]  you could make a strong argument against the plastic bag ban that went into effect in Vancouver recently where it's like,
[6556.58 --> 6556.92]  okay,
[6556.92 --> 6560.96]  but is anybody talking about the energy cost of,
[6560.96 --> 6561.38]  um,
[6561.40 --> 6562.02]  paper bags?
[6562.26 --> 6567.24]  Is anybody talking about the reusability of those plastic bags compared to the paper ones?
[6567.30 --> 6568.08]  Like I get it.
[6568.26 --> 6570.16]  I get a ton of uses out of my plastic bags,
[6570.24 --> 6570.40]  man.
[6570.48 --> 6571.44]  And not everybody does.
[6571.52 --> 6572.60]  Lots of people just throw them away,
[6572.66 --> 6573.12]  but like,
[6573.36 --> 6575.22]  there's issues like that with the straws as well.
[6575.34 --> 6575.52]  Yeah.
[6575.52 --> 6576.46]  Switch to paper straws,
[6576.46 --> 6579.06]  but there's a lot of like different chemicals and things in the paper.
[6579.08 --> 6582.78]  It's not just like paper in a roll.
[6582.88 --> 6584.68]  That isn't even just paper in a roll.
[6584.80 --> 6586.14]  Like that's bleached and everything.
[6586.38 --> 6586.44]  Like,
[6586.70 --> 6591.20]  and then you're putting that in liquid and it's soaking into the liquid and then you're drinking that.
[6591.26 --> 6591.60]  And it's like,
[6591.68 --> 6591.90]  Oh,
[6591.96 --> 6594.14]  this is actually glass straws are the way to go.
[6594.92 --> 6595.84]  But pasta,
[6596.00 --> 6596.82]  just use pasta.
[6597.28 --> 6598.80]  I like pasta or Twizzlers.
[6599.90 --> 6600.64]  I'm not going to,
[6600.70 --> 6601.88]  I'm going to arc Twizzler.
[6602.04 --> 6602.48]  Hey,
[6603.36 --> 6603.96]  there you go.
[6603.96 --> 6604.16]  Nice.
[6604.16 --> 6605.44]  Call back to earlier in the show.
[6605.44 --> 6606.52]  Um,
[6607.88 --> 6608.16]  where,
[6608.20 --> 6609.18]  where was I going with this?
[6609.22 --> 6610.52]  I forget what the question even was.
[6610.62 --> 6610.80]  Dan,
[6610.92 --> 6611.88]  Dan's started.
[6612.12 --> 6612.54]  We were doing it.
[6613.14 --> 6614.88]  Tungsten bulbs are now banned.
[6615.00 --> 6616.16]  LEDs help expensive.
[6616.50 --> 6616.52]  So,
[6616.52 --> 6616.96]  yeah,
[6616.98 --> 6619.64]  I'm not saying that there's any guarantee that you guys will,
[6619.84 --> 6621.24]  will be able to get there in time.
[6621.24 --> 6621.88]  And honestly,
[6621.88 --> 6624.84]  even if the new lights are cheap,
[6625.58 --> 6629.52]  I know that live productions can be very budget constrained.
[6629.52 --> 6630.78]  You might just not have,
[6630.98 --> 6635.30]  you might just not have the budget to replace them at all with anything.
[6635.84 --> 6637.76]  And you certainly can't sell something that's banned.
[6637.76 --> 6639.92]  So you can't even recoup any of your old costs.
[6640.12 --> 6640.28]  Is this,
[6640.32 --> 6641.46]  is this like a,
[6641.90 --> 6643.52]  you have to replace it now thing,
[6643.52 --> 6646.58]  or is it when your current existing thing dies,
[6646.72 --> 6647.64]  you must get a new one?
[6647.64 --> 6648.86]  It's probably a right now thing.
[6648.86 --> 6649.28]  And I was,
[6649.40 --> 6650.50]  I was looking at,
[6650.60 --> 6650.90]  um,
[6651.10 --> 6655.00]  I was looking at something recently that was kind of like this.
[6655.12 --> 6656.34]  That was basically like,
[6656.42 --> 6656.78]  here's a,
[6656.86 --> 6659.00]  here's a ban that's happening now.
[6659.00 --> 6660.00]  And everyone was like,
[6660.52 --> 6660.94]  yo,
[6661.90 --> 6664.08]  this is completely untenable for us.
[6664.08 --> 6664.54]  Like you're,
[6664.54 --> 6666.00]  you're basically just killing our industry.
[6666.06 --> 6667.80]  I can't remember which one it is for the life of me,
[6667.88 --> 6671.24]  but I hope not.
[6671.38 --> 6674.06]  I personally love live theater.
[6674.06 --> 6675.08]  It's not for everyone.
[6675.42 --> 6675.86]  Um,
[6675.86 --> 6676.38]  but you,
[6676.52 --> 6677.10]  if you ask,
[6677.28 --> 6678.10]  if you asked me,
[6678.30 --> 6678.54]  Hey,
[6678.54 --> 6682.98]  you can game for three hours or you can watch a movie for three hours,
[6682.98 --> 6688.16]  or you can do just about any kind of passive form of entertainment for three hours,
[6688.16 --> 6691.02]  or you can go to a live theater show for three hours.
[6691.14 --> 6694.82]  I will take the live theater show every single time.
[6694.92 --> 6695.20]  I just,
[6695.38 --> 6696.50]  I love it.
[6696.54 --> 6696.96]  It's raw.
[6697.04 --> 6697.64]  It's real.
[6697.80 --> 6698.68]  It's fun.
[6698.78 --> 6699.58]  It's intimate.
[6699.90 --> 6700.20]  Um,
[6700.20 --> 6700.46]  you know,
[6700.50 --> 6701.50]  I'm very human.
[6701.50 --> 6706.96]  I have a really hard time enjoying a show that's in a room with tens of thousands of people.
[6706.96 --> 6707.42]  It's just,
[6707.50 --> 6708.90]  it's not really my vibe.
[6709.48 --> 6709.68]  Uh,
[6709.68 --> 6711.00]  whereas a few hundred.
[6711.14 --> 6711.34]  Yeah,
[6711.34 --> 6711.88]  I can,
[6711.96 --> 6713.14]  I can get into that.
[6713.64 --> 6714.04]  Um,
[6714.20 --> 6714.42]  yep.
[6715.22 --> 6715.82]  Like you can,
[6716.00 --> 6719.50]  you can find that person who's laughing really loud at every,
[6719.56 --> 6720.28]  at every joke,
[6720.28 --> 6721.64]  which I don't know.
[6721.64 --> 6724.40]  It doesn't bother me like it would in a movie theater,
[6724.60 --> 6724.88]  you know,
[6724.88 --> 6725.06]  like,
[6725.10 --> 6725.40]  I don't know.
[6725.40 --> 6725.72]  It's just,
[6725.74 --> 6726.16]  it's,
[6726.24 --> 6726.66]  it's just,
[6726.74 --> 6727.04]  it's,
[6727.14 --> 6728.36]  it's human.
[6728.56 --> 6728.82]  Yeah.
[6729.02 --> 6730.32]  It's a really good way of putting it.
[6730.44 --> 6731.16]  I love live theater.
[6731.32 --> 6732.68]  There's a lot of stuff like that too.
[6732.76 --> 6733.20]  Like if,
[6733.26 --> 6733.64]  um,
[6734.44 --> 6734.68]  you know,
[6734.68 --> 6734.92]  if like,
[6734.96 --> 6737.00]  if NASA puts a thing on the moon,
[6737.08 --> 6738.64]  it's like,
[6738.74 --> 6738.98]  no,
[6739.48 --> 6740.46]  is there a person in it?
[6741.12 --> 6741.44]  No,
[6742.14 --> 6742.94]  most people aren't going to care.
[6744.40 --> 6746.72]  Does it necessarily make that much of a difference?
[6746.72 --> 6747.16]  Like we might,
[6747.24 --> 6749.12]  we might even be getting the same amount of accomplishment,
[6749.12 --> 6751.50]  but if there isn't a human involved,
[6751.54 --> 6752.40]  a lot of people are just like,
[6752.46 --> 6753.02]  meh.
[6753.78 --> 6755.84]  It's interesting that,
[6756.00 --> 6756.84]  that aspect,
[6757.10 --> 6762.86]  the whole like viewership on space launches and space activities that involve
[6762.86 --> 6765.68]  people versus ones that don't involve people and how,
[6765.68 --> 6766.44]  uh,
[6766.44 --> 6769.84]  actually well studied those metrics are has been something that's been very
[6769.84 --> 6772.80]  interesting for me when looking at all these new AI tools and stuff.
[6773.42 --> 6773.86]  Oh,
[6774.46 --> 6775.06]  um,
[6776.02 --> 6776.46]  people,
[6776.72 --> 6780.54]  generally care a lot more when other people are involved.
[6780.98 --> 6781.10]  Sure.
[6781.22 --> 6781.46]  I mean,
[6781.46 --> 6783.04]  it's the only reason that,
[6783.08 --> 6783.40]  you know,
[6783.72 --> 6786.26]  the Olympics gets to be a thing is they,
[6786.40 --> 6787.44]  they get you,
[6787.58 --> 6792.66]  they get you focused in on the stories of the people.
[6792.74 --> 6793.00]  Nobody,
[6793.20 --> 6797.86]  nobody actually cares about javelin other than the handful of people who care
[6797.86 --> 6798.80]  about javelin,
[6798.80 --> 6799.62]  um,
[6799.88 --> 6800.32]  you know,
[6800.32 --> 6800.52]  for,
[6800.52 --> 6804.30]  for 3.96 years.
[6804.46 --> 6806.70]  And then the Olympics rolls around,
[6806.72 --> 6807.54]  and they,
[6807.54 --> 6807.84]  and they,
[6807.84 --> 6811.92]  and they tell all these stories and the stories are interesting because we've been
[6811.92 --> 6814.58]  checked out of them for over three years.
[6814.76 --> 6814.90]  Yeah.
[6815.08 --> 6815.48]  Um,
[6815.48 --> 6815.76]  but yeah,
[6815.76 --> 6815.90]  no,
[6815.90 --> 6816.14]  it's the,
[6816.20 --> 6817.98]  it's the human element that matters for any of this.
[6817.98 --> 6818.54]  And it's just,
[6818.60 --> 6819.62]  you're closer to it,
[6819.62 --> 6820.94]  I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[6820.94 --> 6821.80]  Um,
[6822.16 --> 6822.38]  you know,
[6822.38 --> 6824.14]  even like even a live sporting event.
[6824.14 --> 6824.52]  I just,
[6824.62 --> 6825.28]  I find it's,
[6825.42 --> 6826.16]  it's huge.
[6826.24 --> 6831.70]  And I've been told a lot of times that I should go and watch lower level sporting events.
[6831.70 --> 6833.52]  And I probably would enjoy them more,
[6833.62 --> 6839.80]  but I've just been kind of busy ever since following a sports team is actually kind of a lot of work.
[6841.02 --> 6841.42]  Like,
[6841.50 --> 6843.78]  especially if,
[6843.94 --> 6844.22]  if,
[6844.36 --> 6846.96]  if you're like me and you kind of tend to get into things like,
[6846.96 --> 6849.60]  I am going to want to know what's going on with the,
[6849.68 --> 6849.78]  you know,
[6849.82 --> 6853.78]  the other teams that they compete against and all the players and the,
[6853.90 --> 6857.56]  and the ones who are getting called up and the ones who are getting sent down and the coaches and the,
[6857.56 --> 6857.98]  I don't know.
[6858.12 --> 6858.58]  It's a,
[6858.58 --> 6860.56]  it's a whole thing.
[6860.94 --> 6861.06]  Yeah.
[6862.60 --> 6862.96]  Anyway,
[6863.76 --> 6864.64]  what are we supposed to be doing,
[6864.72 --> 6864.88]  Dan?
[6865.46 --> 6865.78]  Ah,
[6865.86 --> 6866.42]  more topics.
[6866.54 --> 6867.00]  More topics.
[6867.00 --> 6867.26]  Sure.
[6867.26 --> 6867.98]  What do you want to talk about,
[6868.04 --> 6868.18]  Luke?
[6868.52 --> 6869.00]  I don't know,
[6869.06 --> 6869.24]  man.
[6869.38 --> 6869.58]  Oh,
[6869.64 --> 6870.28]  how about this?
[6871.12 --> 6871.44]  Uh,
[6871.54 --> 6871.96]  do I,
[6872.08 --> 6872.48]  do I get,
[6872.54 --> 6873.06]  do I get an,
[6873.12 --> 6873.84]  I was right yet.
[6874.12 --> 6874.48]  Um,
[6874.48 --> 6876.92]  the PlayStation portal has,
[6876.96 --> 6877.30]  been,
[6877.30 --> 6877.76]  um,
[6878.08 --> 6880.26]  hacked to play PSP games.
[6880.90 --> 6889.08]  It's called PPSSPP and will allow the console to locally run emulated games for the PlayStation
[6889.08 --> 6889.84]  portable,
[6890.08 --> 6894.20]  which is what many gamers hoped that the portal might be able to do when it was first announced.
[6894.20 --> 6895.92]  One of the devs behind the hack,
[6896.24 --> 6897.32]  Google security researcher,
[6897.44 --> 6898.16]  Andy Nguyen,
[6898.40 --> 6902.28]  known as the flow has stated that the hack is not yet ready for release,
[6902.52 --> 6906.64]  but he demonstrated shots of GTA three running on a PS portal.
[6906.96 --> 6910.54]  It can also apparently run Tekken six and Minecraft.
[6911.30 --> 6911.74]  Um,
[6911.78 --> 6916.26]  this is one of the things that I feel like maybe we didn't emphasize enough in our video,
[6916.26 --> 6921.40]  but we definitely mentioned when talking about the value of the PlayStation portal.
[6921.62 --> 6923.16]  The fact that by the time,
[6923.20 --> 6926.56]  cause remember we did our video a bit later and by the time we did it,
[6926.70 --> 6932.70]  people were already starting to poke and prod at it with at least a little bit of success.
[6932.70 --> 6934.08]  And we were like,
[6934.08 --> 6935.08]  uh,
[6935.08 --> 6938.62]  this thing,
[6938.62 --> 6938.86]  uh,
[6938.86 --> 6939.34]  might be,
[6939.50 --> 6939.66]  uh,
[6939.66 --> 6939.96]  you know,
[6939.96 --> 6940.72]  something might happen.
[6940.80 --> 6941.30]  And obviously,
[6941.42 --> 6941.60]  you know,
[6941.60 --> 6944.28]  like we're not going to be the ones to put the work into it,
[6944.28 --> 6954.90]  but it's the kind of device that is just screaming for someone to figure out how to work around Sony's walled garden.
[6954.90 --> 6962.06]  And I don't think I've seen an Android device that has not ultimately been pwned.
[6962.12 --> 6962.72]  Yeah.
[6962.86 --> 6964.74]  That one that people care about.
[6964.86 --> 6965.16]  Yes.
[6965.38 --> 6965.90]  Um,
[6966.78 --> 6969.72]  and the speaking of Sony devices and being pwned,
[6969.72 --> 6970.52]  uh,
[6970.78 --> 6973.24]  PSVR two is getting self pwned.
[6973.24 --> 6978.76]  Sony has announced that they will be adding PC support to the PSVR two.
[6979.00 --> 6980.78]  Hopefully sometime this year,
[6980.88 --> 6984.58]  the headset had weaker than expected initial sales when it came out last year,
[6984.66 --> 6985.52]  only selling around,
[6985.60 --> 6986.06]  man,
[6986.10 --> 6986.92]  this is wild.
[6987.04 --> 6987.42]  Like even,
[6987.64 --> 6987.94]  you know,
[6987.98 --> 6988.26]  Oh,
[6988.50 --> 6989.04]  this sucked,
[6989.14 --> 6989.64]  uh,
[6989.64 --> 6990.82]  selling around 270,
[6990.82 --> 6992.16]  thousand,
[6992.46 --> 6993.10]  270,
[6993.22 --> 6993.48]  hundred,
[6993.84 --> 6994.30]  200,
[6995.14 --> 6997.30]  270,
[6997.30 --> 7002.08]  thousand units of the 2 million that Sony manufactured for its launch window.
[7002.08 --> 7002.28]  Okay.
[7002.28 --> 7004.96]  So that doesn't sound like a sales shortfall.
[7004.96 --> 7006.42]  That sounds like a manufacturing,
[7006.42 --> 7007.06]  uh,
[7007.06 --> 7007.98]  overestimation.
[7007.98 --> 7008.58]  But anyway,
[7008.94 --> 7009.68]  as of now,
[7009.68 --> 7014.20]  only about a million units total have been sold a discussion question.
[7014.28 --> 7016.64]  Would you switch over to the PSVR two?
[7016.64 --> 7019.06]  If it could play games on steam,
[7019.06 --> 7024.22]  it's a pretty good headset and it's a pretty good price.
[7026.68 --> 7027.12]  Hmm.
[7029.12 --> 7029.68]  I mean,
[7029.70 --> 7031.10]  I wouldn't,
[7032.08 --> 7035.70]  but I do think if you were like getting into VR,
[7035.96 --> 7037.42]  it's a heck of a,
[7037.74 --> 7037.94]  yeah,
[7037.96 --> 7039.74]  it's prices like very well positioned.
[7040.24 --> 7041.28]  How much is it again?
[7041.36 --> 7042.16]  It's like 200 bucks,
[7042.22 --> 7042.80]  isn't it?
[7043.74 --> 7043.96]  Yes.
[7044.02 --> 7044.20]  Oh,
[7044.68 --> 7046.90]  PPSSPP is apparently,
[7046.90 --> 7047.90]  uh,
[7049.16 --> 7051.62]  as apparently the name of a good PSP emulator,
[7051.82 --> 7052.76]  not the name of the hack.
[7052.96 --> 7053.82]  So correction.
[7054.54 --> 7054.96]  Thank you.
[7054.96 --> 7057.10]  It's 750 bucks.
[7057.10 --> 7058.24]  Is that Canadian?
[7059.28 --> 7059.68]  Yeah.
[7060.26 --> 7060.64]  Yeah.
[7060.68 --> 7060.90]  Well,
[7060.90 --> 7062.06]  that's Canadian dollars.
[7063.62 --> 7064.02]  Dude,
[7064.54 --> 7065.00]  it's OLED.
[7065.72 --> 7066.12]  Oh,
[7066.26 --> 7067.24]  yeah.
[7067.76 --> 7068.46]  That's pretty nice.
[7068.60 --> 7068.78]  Yeah.
[7069.02 --> 7069.38]  All right.
[7069.70 --> 7069.98]  Okay.
[7070.30 --> 7070.68]  All right.
[7072.70 --> 7073.80]  I'm only really remembering,
[7073.98 --> 7074.10]  like,
[7074.16 --> 7074.28]  I,
[7074.28 --> 7075.38]  I've never tried this one.
[7075.44 --> 7076.24]  I've only tried the first one.
[7076.32 --> 7076.42]  No,
[7076.44 --> 7076.88]  it's really good.
[7076.94 --> 7077.32]  It's a,
[7077.38 --> 7077.64]  it's yeah,
[7077.64 --> 7078.68]  it's 550 us.
[7079.20 --> 7079.54]  Okay.
[7079.54 --> 7080.10]  Um,
[7080.10 --> 7081.28]  and that includes controllers,
[7081.40 --> 7082.16]  like good controllers.
[7082.34 --> 7082.46]  Oh,
[7082.50 --> 7082.74]  nice.
[7082.88 --> 7083.04]  Yeah.
[7083.26 --> 7083.58]  Yeah.
[7083.66 --> 7083.80]  No,
[7083.84 --> 7084.02]  it's,
[7084.06 --> 7085.36]  it's reasonably compelling.
[7088.42 --> 7088.86]  Uh,
[7088.96 --> 7089.18]  Oh,
[7089.22 --> 7089.34]  wow.
[7089.36 --> 7089.52]  Yeah.
[7089.52 --> 7090.42]  Really high res too.
[7090.60 --> 7090.90]  Wow.
[7091.22 --> 7091.54]  All right.
[7091.86 --> 7092.90]  This is interesting.
[7093.36 --> 7095.32]  The extremely popular new game,
[7095.44 --> 7096.30]  Helldivers 2,
[7096.38 --> 7098.84]  has been plagued with server issues since launch,
[7098.94 --> 7099.72]  uh,
[7099.78 --> 7101.36]  which Arrowhead CEO,
[7101.56 --> 7102.06]  Johan,
[7102.88 --> 7103.28]  Johan,
[7103.42 --> 7109.52]  has acknowledged is largely due to insufficiently optimized backend code and the time needed to
[7109.52 --> 7113.82]  onboard additional engineers to their backend team currently consisting of four developers.
[7114.22 --> 7115.92]  He has recommended that gamers,
[7116.26 --> 7120.50]  especially cash strapped gamers hold off on buying it until the issues are addressed.
[7120.66 --> 7120.90]  Based.
[7121.18 --> 7124.62]  That is unheard of.
[7124.74 --> 7124.94]  Yeah.
[7125.26 --> 7125.50]  I,
[7125.50 --> 7125.84]  I,
[7126.10 --> 7126.46]  to be fair,
[7126.52 --> 7127.52]  if they had a,
[7127.52 --> 7128.90]  a sales goal,
[7129.82 --> 7130.10]  they're,
[7130.32 --> 7135.68]  I'm genuinely estimating probably like 50 to a hundred times beyond what that sales goal was at this point.
[7135.80 --> 7136.24]  Right.
[7136.34 --> 7136.62]  Um,
[7136.62 --> 7139.50]  because they are just smashing it right now.
[7139.96 --> 7140.44]  Um,
[7141.44 --> 7143.42]  so they definitely don't need it.
[7143.44 --> 7145.56]  And it might actually be like the,
[7145.56 --> 7147.98]  the good press from saying this is,
[7148.02 --> 7149.32]  is likely just worth it.
[7149.82 --> 7150.76]  Exacerbating the problem.
[7150.94 --> 7155.46]  Many players have been squatting AFK on servers in order to avoid wait times,
[7155.46 --> 7159.54]  which Arrowhead studios will apparently be addressing in an upcoming patch.
[7159.54 --> 7160.10]  Yeah.
[7160.10 --> 7160.46]  Guys,
[7160.52 --> 7165.02]  when there's an issue with something doing things that make the issue worse for everyone
[7165.02 --> 7166.52]  is bad.
[7166.66 --> 7169.68]  If everyone is like when the login server goes down and then people just sit there.
[7170.14 --> 7170.58]  Yeah.
[7171.24 --> 7171.64]  Logging,
[7171.70 --> 7171.80]  logging,
[7171.80 --> 7172.00]  logging,
[7172.06 --> 7172.14]  logging,
[7172.14 --> 7177.26]  When the show goes down and people start spamming F in the chat so that when I try to
[7177.26 --> 7178.56]  type an update,
[7178.56 --> 7185.44]  see it no one sees it yeah yeah people are the problem yeah is that is that patch out already
[7185.44 --> 7192.08]  sorry uh yeah the 15 minute afk patches out and they also pretty much doubled server capacity
[7192.08 --> 7196.00]  yesterday they've been working non-stop it's amazing i think it's like a team of four people
[7196.00 --> 7202.12]  uh the back end team is four people yeah that's right the game is currently pc ps5 only but a
[7202.12 --> 7206.00]  popular petition is currently circulating to port the game to xbox which i'm sure they will do at
[7206.00 --> 7211.82]  some point when they are not busy well i think it's like a playstation published game so maybe not
[7211.82 --> 7216.98]  oh discussion question does a company have a certain level of responsibility to encourage
[7216.98 --> 7223.38]  their customers to make good financial decisions um technically that's the most optimistic sounding
[7223.38 --> 7229.42]  thing i've ever read yeah technically no not even slightly appreciate you uh probably jessica who
[7229.42 --> 7235.26]  wrote that i think riley's more jaded yeah yeah i think it's really cool when they do but yeah
[7235.26 --> 7243.32]  uh but i think expecting it at this point is simply not realistic yeah it saddens me to say that
[7243.32 --> 7253.76]  but it's the truth yeah that was like um uh the pal world lead developer or something so yeah i don't
[7253.76 --> 7258.40]  know what it was um but people pointed out like oh there's like a lot less players playing pal world
[7258.40 --> 7265.06]  now and he's like that's cool there was content and they probably like played it and then hopefully
[7265.06 --> 7270.74]  we'll release more content and they'll come back that's fine it's like sweet yeah that makes sense
[7270.74 --> 7278.50]  hey you know who else did the right thing recently the xbox team yeah xbox is adding the ability to
[7278.50 --> 7285.66]  recalibrate their own thumbsticks on series x and s and xbox one controllers this will allow players to
[7285.66 --> 7291.54]  fix their own calibration issues without having to get a repair or contact support it will also allow
[7291.54 --> 7297.66]  players to independently set up replacement thumbsticks very cool in other news earlier this
[7297.66 --> 7303.32]  week xbox announced that four previously microsoft exclusive games sea of thieves hi-fi rush grounded and
[7303.32 --> 7309.46]  pentiment would all be coming to ps5 and the latter two would be coming to switch is platform
[7309.46 --> 7319.28]  exclusivity just like dead i think to a certain degree is it buried maybe like okay we have a video
[7319.28 --> 7328.72]  coming that's a um console tier list video so we go through and we rank from from s to f um all of
[7328.72 --> 7333.32]  the major consoles from all the major players and we don't get into handheld it's just like your
[7333.32 --> 7339.58]  your living room consoles so we just like crushes um i believe we ended up being
[7339.58 --> 7355.98]  a tier so because pause wait because one of our criteria was how how how well the game library holds
[7355.98 --> 7364.62]  up today we factored in some historical significance so like the atari 2600 ends up with like a b or
[7364.62 --> 7372.90]  something just because of how many groundbreaking things happened on that console okay um but but one
[7372.90 --> 7380.18]  of our major considerations was how do the games for that platform hold up and this was something that
[7380.18 --> 7384.92]  david and i talked about he's the writer for it and you know how passionate he is about games yeah and
[7384.92 --> 7391.68]  he's super into the hardware side as well but he's a very very passionate game seems like a video that
[7391.68 --> 7398.50]  that he would crush oh yeah he killed it he did a great job yeah um but anyway one of the things that
[7398.50 --> 7408.28]  started to happen as we made our way into ps5 xbox series is it became really difficult to evaluate a
[7408.28 --> 7419.84]  console that blurry yeah because what is an xbox series game we discuss how one of the struggles for
[7419.84 --> 7428.26]  the xbox series is that unlike the 360 they haven't really had a box mover title not really not to the
[7428.26 --> 7436.62]  degree that sony has um whether you're talking about spider-man or um okay final fantasy 7 remastered
[7436.62 --> 7448.02]  whatever the case may be what do you mean halo okay so a no and b it's not exclusive you can't shift
[7448.02 --> 7456.22]  boxes with software that runs on other boxes yeah and and microsoft has really struggled uh not only
[7456.22 --> 7462.30]  is the xbox series underselling the plate ps5 by like one to two or something like that according to the
[7462.30 --> 7466.38]  most recent numbers we were able to find surprise it's honestly like that low most of them are series
[7466.38 --> 7472.74]  s they're the basic one they're not even selling their premium console not really it's it's a non-factor
[7472.74 --> 7478.36]  in the current generation race and so you know we're looking at this thing and i'm like
[7478.36 --> 7486.42]  okay so microsoft clearly clearly saw the path here as to to be a gaming services company
[7486.42 --> 7492.42]  uh so how do we even evaluate their performance in a race they're not even really running
[7492.42 --> 7500.16]  yeah that's interesting and even the playstation 5 one of the challenges that we had evaluating its
[7500.16 --> 7505.32]  library was that over the first couple of years because the ps4 had such an enormous install base
[7505.32 --> 7512.86]  and reasonably powerful still over the first couple of years we saw so many games with simultaneous
[7512.86 --> 7519.58]  releases on both of those platforms that it really was more akin to a pc release that runs okay
[7519.58 --> 7526.56]  on your older pc or runs great on your newer pc so how do you evaluate the game library of the ps5
[7526.56 --> 7531.80]  here we are what three three years in i think three years since launch yeah when most of the games
[7531.80 --> 7538.88]  aren't ps5 games they're playstation games yeah i i think too like it's it's i think the main blurring
[7538.88 --> 7543.26]  that's going to happen like even with this announcement uh some of them are going to ps5
[7543.26 --> 7550.12]  but not oh wait no they all are going to ps5 see that that's a little bit weird to me uh more games
[7550.12 --> 7555.72]  coming to pc is not that weird to me and i suspect playstation games personally i don't think we're
[7555.72 --> 7560.76]  going to see a ton of them coming to xbox just bad blood i think well no i think the reason why xbox
[7560.76 --> 7566.30]  is doing this is so that they look less like a monopoly because they're getting a lot of issues
[7566.30 --> 7570.64]  lately with companies going after them and one of the discussions around that has been
[7570.64 --> 7577.22]  um that you're using this to try to crush playstation so they're going look we're giving our games over
[7577.22 --> 7582.30]  to playstation yeah for now our our old games that people don't care about the issue is is that the
[7582.30 --> 7588.02]  way that monopolies squeeze out the competition is not by doing it immediately um we i was having an
[7588.02 --> 7593.88]  interesting conversation with someone about uber's trajectory or like uber's path to uh to
[7593.88 --> 7599.58]  profitability they're profitable now for apparently the first time and i had to take an uber somewhere
[7599.58 --> 7605.60]  and it was like 30 and it was barely anywhere so it was as expensive or more expensive than what i
[7605.60 --> 7611.84]  would have paid for a cab way back in the day and like uber eats makes no sense anymore at the rates
[7611.84 --> 7618.38]  that you pay for it it's like gee should i pay double the price for a cold meal
[7618.38 --> 7626.20]  the already ridiculous price yeah like you don't eat out much no but have you gone at all lately
[7626.20 --> 7633.38]  it's been a while okay um
[7633.38 --> 7641.14]  by the way dan why didn't you join us for dinner after the shoot oh i didn't um i didn't even think
[7641.14 --> 7648.38]  did anybody text you um i think probably when i was already home okay well okay well first i invited
[7648.38 --> 7652.86]  you and then i guess you didn't hear me uh i didn't realize that you were going to be breaking
[7652.86 --> 7658.58]  immediately oh yeah i thought that you were probably going to wait an hour or two okay well we did a
[7658.58 --> 7664.12]  crew dinner uh on the uh the giant display thing yeah and i was like yeah we'll do a crew dinner which
[7664.12 --> 7669.36]  means you didn't invite me to the giant display thing at or and i'm not crew anymore no no you
[7669.36 --> 7675.00]  are not crew no i explicitly invited you to join the crew dinner which which is uh when we like
[7675.00 --> 7680.84]  when we do an off-site shoot we'll often cover the meal just because people are usually
[7680.84 --> 7686.04]  inconvenienced in some way whether it's dan and i understand i had technically already taken
[7686.04 --> 7690.64]  i'm talking to the viewers we're just not included not to you this is what it's like to work here
[7690.64 --> 7701.52]  looking at the camera oh no the point is sorry luke sorry the point is did you did you read this at
[7701.52 --> 7711.18]  all the receipt no oh good okay so where would you rank um where would you rank mexican on like uh
[7711.18 --> 7716.32]  like like no no no no no i guess it's delicious oh pricing yeah just hold on a second yeah is this
[7716.32 --> 7721.98]  is this uh is this a uh like a generally premiumly priced cuisine or more of like an affordable
[7721.98 --> 7728.44]  everyday cuisine usually more affordable okay um and you know generally speaking your hole in the
[7728.44 --> 7736.12]  wall versus your like you know chain or you know upscale generally here generally more here generally
[7736.12 --> 7742.40]  more here okay so we went to a mexican hole in the wall yep and delicious by the way delicious by the
[7742.40 --> 7753.48]  way yeah um we got two a tacos nice uh a taco platter nice uh they did add a guacamole oh that's
[7753.48 --> 7763.20]  expensive but nice yeah um a gringo sp lun whatever that is a couple burritos a dorito another burrito
[7763.20 --> 7770.86]  and an enchiladas plate so we fed um how many were we dan we were seven i guess without you
[7770.86 --> 7776.34]  something like that i feel like you just got taxed for being a white dude we got the gringo thing we
[7776.34 --> 7784.06]  got five mexican gringa gringa i don't know what that means look do i speak do i speak spanish okay
[7784.06 --> 7790.48]  um gringo is is google says gringo is a person especially an american who is not hispanic or latino

[7799.16 --> 7805.28]  like hole in the wall mexican food how much do you think the bill was seven people this is after

[7811.30 --> 7814.32]  remember tipping is like out of control seven people
[7814.32 --> 7827.30]  160 bucks dude you're not even close it's way higher whoa and i was close to the subtotal yeah
[7827.30 --> 7832.52]  you're close to the can i see can i see you were under the pre-tax pre-tip total yeah this is more
[7832.52 --> 7839.90]  expensive per plate than i expected yeah for sure yeah yeah and like i was expecting like after tax
[7839.90 --> 7844.16]  per plate it was gonna be like 20 bucks and it's before tax per plate 20 bucks and that's no tip
[7844.16 --> 7853.88]  yep and like you know it's one of those things where on principle yeah the way that it is right now
[7853.88 --> 7858.74]  is not how i think things should work people should be paid a reasonable amount of money
[7858.74 --> 7864.74]  and then the price on the menu should be what the food costs and if there's exceptional service
[7864.74 --> 7871.48]  then you can leave a small tip that's how it's like supposed to work yeah and that should be like rare
[7871.48 --> 7877.62]  but here's the thing that's not how it works not at all and as someone who can afford the you know
[7877.62 --> 7884.84]  minimum eight you know it'll be like 18 20 25 on the three options or whatever as someone who can
[7884.84 --> 7892.12]  afford to tip like that and as someone who knows that that optimistic way that i wish it worked
[7892.12 --> 7900.00]  is not reality and that people actually do just depend on these tips for survival um i do tip
[7900.00 --> 7910.22]  i'll just i'll just i'll press the stupid button or whatever but like that's wild yeah oh it's yeah
[7910.22 --> 7918.36]  it's ridiculous i i i massively prefer so i'll even take it a little bit further i wish tipping wasn't a
[7918.36 --> 7924.48]  thing at all i wish it was just priced in and yeah maybe if it's over and above you just don't round
[7924.48 --> 7933.02]  or whatever and give them the remaining um but i also wish um like in in stores and stuff tax was
[7933.02 --> 7938.76]  included in the listed price like that's how they do it in europe the fact that there are countries
[7938.76 --> 7943.20]  that have figured both of these things out and we're over here just like well i don't know guess
[7943.20 --> 7954.08]  yeah like what no anyway i uh yeah i i i hate it but it's one of those things where you know you
[7954.08 --> 7959.58]  could say okay well linus having luke guess after tip is not reasonable because that wasn't actually
[7959.58 --> 7965.20]  the price but what i was trying to say was it effectively is here no because i know that that
[7965.20 --> 7970.92]  kitchen staff and that server are not being paid enough any tips at all they're going to be like
[7970.92 --> 7977.58]  homeless they will not be able to live yeah so so it's not really optional is it it's very expensive
[7977.58 --> 7985.70]  to live in bc and if you yeah i don't know are your current event asks what about on takeout orders
[7985.70 --> 7995.30]  um if it's a place that i go regularly um i will tip well and if it's a place that i don't go
[7995.30 --> 8003.50]  regularly then i'll do like 10 because the reality of it is that someone packed it and i also don't know
[8003.50 --> 8009.78]  where the tip is going it often gets shared around but um what i do know is that even though
[8009.78 --> 8015.34]  theoretically there's um you know lower overhead for takeout orders in some ways it can be a lot
[8015.34 --> 8021.52]  higher now especially with all the expensive um like more expensive like paper bags cost way more
[8021.52 --> 8024.70]  than plastic bags and they're not allowed to use plastic bags anymore and stuff like that if you get
[8024.70 --> 8029.32]  a drink they're gonna try to like tape over the thing so and they're they're taping close the bags
[8029.32 --> 8034.72]  often or stapling it closed so even the even the restaurant owners themselves even if they're just
[8034.72 --> 8041.32]  pocketing it there's a lot of overhead involved in in handling takeout orders uh so i'll just i'll i'll
[8041.32 --> 8048.20]  leave a small tip anyway because i i can't think of any chains that i eat at um that i do take out from
[8048.20 --> 8053.76]  so i yeah and them i don't know if i would bother but even then like a lot of them are franchises and
[8053.76 --> 8058.76]  it's it's relatively small business owners that are running the restaurants even if it's you know a
[8058.76 --> 8062.86]  multi-billion dollar multinational that you know owns the branding or whatever else yeah
[8062.86 --> 8072.42]  mda 187 asks if plastic bags are illegal in canada how do you get your milk okay a couple things oh
[8072.42 --> 8080.32]  that's hilarious number one not those ones the like disposable plastic bags for groceries and
[8080.32 --> 8085.56]  and takeout and stuff like that why why aren't the milk bags yeah ironically we can still buy plastic
[8085.56 --> 8092.02]  garbage bags so i can't use my shopping bag to line my garbage can but i can buy a completely
[8092.02 --> 8098.78]  separate bag to put in there brilliant why is that allowed brilliant it's pointless um and then also
[8098.78 --> 8106.12]  the whole milk bag thing was as big a surprise to me as it was to you yes uh it wasn't until i did
[8106.12 --> 8112.10]  not a bc thing yeah it wasn't until i did my uh my my my quebec exchange that i first encountered
[8112.10 --> 8117.64]  bagged milk apparently it's a thing is this in more of canada than i've ever known um yeah and you
[8117.64 --> 8124.60]  can find it in bc it's just very rare but it is pretty much not a thing here it's yeah it's gallon
[8124.60 --> 8131.06]  jugs just like our neighbors down south or paper cartons the because bc's kind of tucked behind the
[8131.06 --> 8136.38]  rockies we're we're honestly like much more americanized than a lot of the rest of canada i think
[8136.38 --> 8143.72]  um we're much more west coast eyes yeah i would i would say like hyper similar to washington seattle
[8143.72 --> 8150.72]  area i would say that if if if i if i had to if i had to say like what our country would be it would
[8150.72 --> 8160.26]  probably be yeah like bc yukon bc washington oregon yeah would be like like wet wet coast to stand yeah
[8160.26 --> 8167.90]  yeah um and then and then everyone else can kind of do whatever it is that they're doing uh
[8167.90 --> 8173.04]  yeah those are the south those are the east of there like quite related like i i remember like
[8173.04 --> 8177.82]  every time i run into oregoners or washingtoners i don't even know what you guys call yourselves
[8177.82 --> 8183.26]  like oh these are my people it's just it's just obvious like the accent is the same even though
[8183.26 --> 8188.62]  technically we're Canadian and they're American or something like the accent's the same yeah the the
[8188.62 --> 8194.62]  the alignment on a lot of stuff is the same it's it's just it's kind of funny um apparently some
[8194.62 --> 8202.58]  parts of the states also have bagged milk oh yeah oregonian is that is that it sorry i'm probably
[8202.58 --> 8211.32]  saying this wrong but yeah pacific northwest let's go um researchers have lost a window into china which
[8211.32 --> 8218.42]  is an interesting perspective on this that i would not have considered academics especially researchers
[8218.42 --> 8225.52]  focused on china have criticized google's decision to quietly remove cached pages from its search
[8225.52 --> 8231.60]  results the feature allowed users to view prior versions of web pages which made it invaluable
[8231.60 --> 8237.20]  in tracking information on the chinese internet which is of course heavily censored with important
[8237.20 --> 8243.10]  information often being retroactively scrubbed by the government according to danny sullivan google's
[8243.10 --> 8247.54]  search liaison the feature was originally intended to help people access pages back when the internet
[8247.54 --> 8252.84]  was far less reliable that were just down and not working which is why it has now been discontinued
[8252.84 --> 8258.32]  because it's no longer really needed and our discussion question here is should we preserve features
[8258.32 --> 8266.80]  even when their intended purpose is no longer relevant um for google's part i don't see why they would have
[8266.80 --> 8272.86]  any interest in this new purpose for that feature so i can understand why they're discontinuing it
[8272.86 --> 8282.70]  like they're essentially like a much much shorter term version of the wayback machine right um and i can see why we don't want them to do that
[8282.70 --> 8294.34]  but i can also see how we have no real way of arguing that they should keep the feature because it doesn't benefit their business model in any meaningful way
[8294.34 --> 8303.14]  yeah it's unfortunate when we lose things like that but like it's a business it's not a government
[8303.14 --> 8307.64]  luke i have something to show you remember we talked about i've seen this
[8307.64 --> 8314.72]  oh got him well that sucks anyway this is really funny i was going to try and convince luke
[8314.72 --> 8320.44]  however briefly that this was the old will smith video and then the new one was
[8320.44 --> 8324.56]  sora um because he had asked about what if will smith spaghet
[8324.56 --> 8332.74]  i did i did actually call it right away um for someone trying to rehabilitate their public image
[8332.74 --> 8335.08]  uh this was a good play yes
[8335.08 --> 8337.78]  yep
[8337.78 --> 8346.28]  anyway i i i enjoyed he slapped chris rock right yeah i think they're like doing a movie together or something
[8346.28 --> 8349.04]  really i think so oh man
[8349.04 --> 8352.44]  did we just get 4d chest
[8352.44 --> 8354.64]  maybe
[8354.64 --> 8357.66]  breast through time
[8357.66 --> 8359.36]  4d chest
[8359.36 --> 8360.84]  doesn't matter
[8360.84 --> 8365.64]  you're gonna injure the poor man
[8365.64 --> 8366.84]  yeah
[8366.84 --> 8369.08]  oh man
[8369.08 --> 8373.72]  oh boy
[8373.72 --> 8375.42]  anywho um
[8375.42 --> 8380.50]  uh so i don't know i'm not finding anything on this so maybe i just made it up or maybe it was a
[8380.50 --> 8382.10]  very old video from before the slap
[8382.10 --> 8388.40]  but yeah it's uh it's interesting because you know what i was i was talking about when we announced
[8388.40 --> 8393.58]  sora sorry uh when we not when we announced sora when we talked about sora on the show last week
[8393.58 --> 8396.02]  i talked about how it was weird how
[8396.02 --> 8399.78]  certain parts of the frame would feel like they were in rewind
[8399.78 --> 8404.94]  and other parts are going forward and like it didn't really have a good sense of time and how things would actually
[8404.94 --> 8406.64]  like progress forward
[8406.64 --> 8411.04]  um one of the editing tricks that they used in the will smith video
[8411.04 --> 8414.06]  uh because it's not ai generated but there are editing tricks
[8414.06 --> 8415.18]  is they used
[8415.18 --> 8419.04]  like rewind and forward mixing and stuff like that to make it look really weird
[8419.04 --> 8422.92]  um i think if the ai video stuff fixes that
[8422.92 --> 8425.92]  it'll be immediately significantly more believable
[8425.92 --> 8437.98]  we've got a bit of an update for you guys we've had some members of our community getting notifications from various monitoring services informing them that they've been affected by a data leak from the ltt forum
[8437.98 --> 8447.20]  uh this appears to be a bunch of very old leaked data which has been re-released onto the internet due to a massive leak from leak lookup.com
[8447.20 --> 8450.52]  a data breach indexer which was uncovered last month
[8450.52 --> 8453.94]  uh there does not appear to be any new breach of the ltt forum and
[8453.94 --> 8457.54]  if there was you would be informed as soon as humanly possible
[8457.54 --> 8460.90]  yeah so just hopefully that um helps put your mind at ease
[8460.90 --> 8463.68]  speaking of your mind being as soon as reasonably possible
[8463.68 --> 8465.42]  yes well humanly
[8465.42 --> 8468.74]  yeah we might take a sec though to like verify
[8468.74 --> 8470.00]  impacts that's human
[8470.00 --> 8471.16]  okay sounds good
[8471.16 --> 8473.92]  are vending machines spying on students
[8473.92 --> 8474.66]  yes
[8474.66 --> 8476.94]  can you
[8476.94 --> 8479.86]  let me do my job
[8479.86 --> 8480.46]  nope
[8480.46 --> 8484.00]  the university of waterloo in canada has announced
[8484.00 --> 8485.34]  that it will be removing
[8485.34 --> 8487.56]  several m&m branding
[8487.56 --> 8489.56]  branded vending machines
[8489.56 --> 8492.04]  because the green m&m is too
[8492.04 --> 8494.60]  too sexy and it's a distraction for the students
[8494.60 --> 8498.36]  sorry
[8498.36 --> 8500.06]  uh they'll be removing them
[8500.06 --> 8503.92]  following the revelation that the machines have the ability to collect
[8503.92 --> 8506.02]  facial recognition data
[8506.02 --> 8506.58]  yeah
[8506.58 --> 8510.58]  this was discovered when one waterloo student posted a picture of a strange
[8510.58 --> 8512.62]  error message on one of the machines
[8512.62 --> 8516.90]  invenda.vending.facialrecognition.app.exe
[8516.90 --> 8519.04]  one student publication
[8519.04 --> 8522.06]  mathnews tracked down the manufacturer's sales brochures
[8522.06 --> 8525.10]  which say that these smart vending machines can collect
[8525.10 --> 8525.94]  this is amazing
[8525.94 --> 8529.40]  estimated ages and genders of every client
[8529.40 --> 8531.94]  and send that data to various parties
[8531.94 --> 8532.94]  including mars
[8532.94 --> 8534.06]  the owners of m&ms
[8534.06 --> 8537.16]  invenda claims that their machines are wholly compliant
[8537.16 --> 8538.96]  with the eu's stringent
[8538.96 --> 8540.76]  general data protection regulation
[8540.76 --> 8542.36]  though that would only be possible
[8542.36 --> 8544.42]  if the machine requested explicit permission
[8544.42 --> 8546.46]  every time it stored a user's data
[8546.46 --> 8549.10]  yeah i was gonna say i have a big doubt on that one
[8549.10 --> 8550.44]  adaria vending services
[8550.44 --> 8552.46]  who were responsible for the machines on campus
[8552.46 --> 8555.62]  say that the technology acts as a motion sensor
[8555.62 --> 8556.62]  that detects faces
[8556.62 --> 8558.90]  and activates the purchasing interface
[8558.90 --> 8561.30]  but does not collect user data
[8561.30 --> 8562.50]  insane idea here
[8562.50 --> 8564.18]  but just use a motion sensor
[8564.18 --> 8567.06]  are you a f***ing idiot?
[8567.22 --> 8568.18]  crazy idea i know
[8568.18 --> 8569.96]  i am a little out of it right now
[8569.96 --> 8570.36]  luke
[8570.36 --> 8571.22]  i uh
[8571.22 --> 8572.08]  you know i'm just
[8572.08 --> 8573.06]  i'm trying all right
[8573.06 --> 8573.88]  i'm just
[8573.88 --> 8575.68]  i'm just gonna bring dan in
[8575.68 --> 8576.40]  as our host
[8576.40 --> 8577.48]  co-host of the wanchot
[8577.48 --> 8578.14]  honestly it's fair
[8578.14 --> 8578.98]  just get the f*** out of here
[8578.98 --> 8579.78]  i'll go produce
[8579.78 --> 8582.34]  that's the stupidest idea i've ever heard
[8582.34 --> 8584.96]  slash s
[8584.96 --> 8585.18]  chill
[8585.18 --> 8589.82]  absolutely wild
[8589.82 --> 8591.92]  the machine's facial recognition technology
[8591.92 --> 8593.90]  uses an extremely small
[8593.90 --> 8595.26]  unobtrusive camera
[8595.26 --> 8596.86]  and many students reported
[8596.86 --> 8598.34]  being completely unaware
[8598.34 --> 8599.32]  of any camera
[8599.32 --> 8600.30]  when using the machines
[8600.30 --> 8602.52]  because why would you be looking for that?
[8602.64 --> 8603.58]  is there a picture of these?
[8603.66 --> 8604.50]  like can we see it?
[8604.74 --> 8605.14]  uh
[8605.14 --> 8605.88]  let's have a look
[8605.88 --> 8607.02]  let's bring up math news
[8607.02 --> 8607.94]  oh wow
[8607.94 --> 8611.04]  this is great
[8611.04 --> 8612.44]  this reads exactly
[8612.44 --> 8614.68]  like a university student paper
[8614.68 --> 8616.00]  i love it
[8616.00 --> 8617.40]  um
[8617.40 --> 8619.50]  anyway
[8619.50 --> 8620.60]  yeah
[8620.60 --> 8622.08]  this is actually amazing
[8622.08 --> 8622.50]  what does that
[8622.50 --> 8623.74]  what does that blog quote say?
[8624.68 --> 8626.12]  if we do some actual terms
[8626.12 --> 8628.48]  they'll finally restart our wikipedia page
[8628.48 --> 8633.12]  it's
[8633.12 --> 8635.44]  exactly as irreverent
[8635.44 --> 8636.78]  as i would expect it to be
[8636.78 --> 8637.42]  uh
[8637.42 --> 8637.78]  anywho
[8637.78 --> 8638.16]  that's fantastic
[8638.16 --> 8639.00]  here's the picture
[8639.00 --> 8640.44]  so let's play
[8640.44 --> 8641.22]  find the camera
[8641.22 --> 8645.16]  i don't know
[8645.16 --> 8646.80]  uh
[8646.80 --> 8647.60]  i think i saw it
[8647.60 --> 8648.02]  where
[8648.02 --> 8650.00]  yeah i see it
[8650.00 --> 8650.48]  i
[8650.48 --> 8651.26]  oh wait
[8651.26 --> 8652.34]  it can't be that
[8652.34 --> 8652.96]  i think so
[8652.96 --> 8654.16]  why would they embed it there?
[8654.24 --> 8655.86]  why wouldn't they just embed it in the black thing?
[8656.12 --> 8656.64]  fairly certain
[8656.64 --> 8657.42]  if i'm gonna
[8657.42 --> 8659.10]  i'm gonna steal the screen capture thing
[8659.10 --> 8659.36]  yeah sure
[8659.36 --> 8660.16]  um
[8660.16 --> 8662.28]  so that's a zoomed in photo of it
[8662.28 --> 8663.88]  which is why i was pretty sure that was it
[8663.88 --> 8666.34]  because i think this blue here is the blue of the m&m that you saw
[8666.34 --> 8667.40]  this looks just like a
[8667.40 --> 8668.56]  like a broken hole
[8668.56 --> 8668.96]  yeah
[8668.96 --> 8669.98]  like this doesn't look like it was
[8669.98 --> 8671.60]  it looks like it was hacked into it
[8671.60 --> 8671.90]  yeah
[8671.90 --> 8672.94]  weird
[8672.94 --> 8673.66]  yeah
[8673.66 --> 8674.22]  kind of odd
[8674.22 --> 8677.14]  that's bizarre dude
[8677.14 --> 8679.26]  freaking dystopia
[8679.26 --> 8681.54]  we should just start calling it the dystopia show
[8681.54 --> 8684.10]  because it's all we ever freaking talk about
[8684.10 --> 8686.52]  welcome to the wan show
[8686.52 --> 8687.58]  we talk about spooky
[8687.58 --> 8691.50]  um
[8691.50 --> 8692.54]  all right
[8692.54 --> 8694.04]  disco elysium 2 is dead
[8694.04 --> 8694.76]  i'm sorry
[8694.76 --> 8695.46]  no
[8695.46 --> 8696.54]  yeah
[8696.54 --> 8698.86]  let's buy a really good ip
[8698.86 --> 8699.48]  and then
[8699.48 --> 8701.42]  worst news i've heard all year

[8722.72 --> 8723.78]  um
[8723.78 --> 8725.34]  john asks
[8725.34 --> 8729.70]  is the ptm 7950 thermal phase change pad
[8729.70 --> 8731.54]  safe for a vertical mount
[8731.54 --> 8732.42]  um
[8732.42 --> 8735.48]  this isn't gonna leak from between my aio and my cpu over time
[8735.48 --> 8737.42]  and also asks
[8737.42 --> 8741.42]  do you have a plush version for my cpu pillow that i bought last year
[8741.42 --> 8742.66]  keep up the decent work
[8742.66 --> 8744.72]  thanks john
[8744.72 --> 8746.04]  i love that
[8746.04 --> 8746.54]  yes
[8746.54 --> 8748.48]  it is safe for a vertical mount
[8748.48 --> 8750.58]  and we will keep up the decent work
[8750.58 --> 8751.02]  in fact
[8751.02 --> 8752.22]  we have some
[8752.22 --> 8753.18]  absolutely
[8753.18 --> 8754.44]  awesome
[8754.44 --> 8755.38]  videos coming
[8755.38 --> 8756.50]  i wish i could
[8756.50 --> 8758.54]  i wish i could just make the wan show better
[8758.54 --> 8760.14]  by just playing them for you
[8760.14 --> 8761.12]  and watching them together
[8761.12 --> 8761.70]  uh
[8761.70 --> 8763.34]  kyle's amd ultimate tech upgrade
[8763.34 --> 8764.44]  oh i'm excited about that
[8764.44 --> 8765.16]  i saw the
[8765.16 --> 8766.14]  ecc upload
[8766.14 --> 8766.88]  and
[8766.88 --> 8767.56]  i'm excited
[8767.56 --> 8768.16]  oh you watched it
[8768.16 --> 8768.66]  i haven't watched it
[8768.66 --> 8769.98]  i just saw it go up on ecc
[8769.98 --> 8770.46]  and i was like
[8770.46 --> 8772.46]  it's like 30 minutes long
[8772.46 --> 8773.08]  and
[8773.08 --> 8774.66]  blew by
[8774.66 --> 8776.98]  i had no idea the time had passed
[8776.98 --> 8777.38]  that's wicked
[8777.38 --> 8778.26]  it's so good
[8778.26 --> 8778.78]  good
[8778.78 --> 8779.06]  uh
[8779.06 --> 8780.48]  the all china pc
[8780.48 --> 8782.82]  really good
[8782.82 --> 8785.00]  uh tanner did an outstanding job
[8785.00 --> 8786.22]  because rather than just
[8786.22 --> 8788.16]  buying weird chinese stuff
[8788.16 --> 8789.12]  and reacting to it
[8789.12 --> 8791.32]  he includes a whole bunch of context
[8791.32 --> 8792.80]  who the f*** are these companies
[8792.80 --> 8793.60]  yeah yeah
[8793.60 --> 8795.00]  like who are their parent companies
[8795.00 --> 8796.14]  how long have they been around
[8796.14 --> 8798.14]  how long do they say they've been around
[8798.14 --> 8800.14]  versus how long have they actually been around
[8800.14 --> 8800.46]  like
[8800.46 --> 8801.84]  it's
[8801.84 --> 8802.92]  it's pretty neat
[8802.92 --> 8803.94]  and
[8803.94 --> 8809.00]  in some ways a little scary
[8809.00 --> 8810.04]  yeah
[8810.04 --> 8811.06]  yeah it's uh
[8811.06 --> 8811.54]  so that's
[8811.54 --> 8813.04]  that's a really good one that i just reviewed
[8813.04 --> 8813.70]  man what else
[8813.70 --> 8814.78]  i don't know
[8814.78 --> 8817.06]  there's a ton of really good stuff coming over the next little bit
[8817.06 --> 8817.78]  i'm very excited
[8817.78 --> 8819.06]  um
[8819.06 --> 8820.66]  dan hit me
[8820.66 --> 8822.16]  hey lld
[8822.16 --> 8825.72]  picking up the abcs of gaming for my soon to be born son
[8825.72 --> 8827.64]  do you see ai
[8827.64 --> 8832.02]  ai and ar headsets being useful tool to help kids learn
[8832.02 --> 8837.58]  i think we go through this every single time there's a new technological innovation
[8837.58 --> 8840.18]  first they will it was computers in the classroom
[8840.18 --> 8841.78]  are these a good tool for teaching kids
[8841.78 --> 8842.28]  like well
[8842.28 --> 8843.62]  yes but also no
[8843.62 --> 8844.20]  3d printers
[8844.20 --> 8846.64]  then we went through it with uh you know tablets
[8846.64 --> 8847.26]  yeah
[8847.26 --> 8849.12]  then we went through it with cell phones
[8849.12 --> 8850.24]  then we go through it with
[8850.24 --> 8851.22]  everything
[8851.22 --> 8853.38]  yes but also no
[8853.38 --> 8855.74]  is is the answer
[8855.74 --> 8861.58]  everything in moderation right
[8861.58 --> 8862.44]  well not everything but
[8862.44 --> 8866.06]  yeah i mean don't don't moderate in moderation
[8866.06 --> 8867.04]  yeah
[8867.04 --> 8868.50]  that's a good one
[8868.50 --> 8869.16]  it's a good quote
[8869.16 --> 8871.56]  you need to excessively moderate
[8871.56 --> 8873.24]  yourself
[8873.24 --> 8875.48]  now now we're getting dystopian again
[8875.48 --> 8877.22]  i don't know
[8877.22 --> 8878.66]  i think i think the way to
[8878.66 --> 8880.96]  to fight off the dystopia is to
[8880.96 --> 8882.96]  be constantly at war
[8882.96 --> 8885.36]  this is this is my whole new thing
[8885.36 --> 8886.24]  i'm into that
[8886.24 --> 8887.78]  i think i've talked about this before
[8887.78 --> 8889.14]  40k that's how it happened
[8889.14 --> 8890.44]  everybody was really moderate
[8890.44 --> 8891.86]  i don't mean war isn't like
[8891.86 --> 8893.08]  shooting people
[8893.08 --> 8894.56]  i mean war isn't like
[8894.56 --> 8895.18]  uh
[8895.18 --> 8898.20]  understanding that so many things around you
[8898.20 --> 8899.02]  are
[8899.02 --> 8902.76]  obsessively intentionally manipulative
[8902.76 --> 8906.80]  float plane chats just starting to list things that are
[8906.80 --> 8908.14]  not okay in moderation
[8908.14 --> 8912.12]  only f*** your neighbor's wife in moderation
[8912.12 --> 8914.82]  no not anything in moderation
[8914.82 --> 8917.80]  i mean hey
[8917.80 --> 8920.72]  maybe maybe there's an agreement there
[8920.72 --> 8921.12]  yeah
[8921.12 --> 8924.00]  yeah don't abuse that relationship
[8924.00 --> 8925.00]  seems very healthy
[8925.00 --> 8928.14]  it's always good to be positive about that sort of stuff
[8928.14 --> 8928.98]  okay
[8928.98 --> 8931.04]  yeah maybe maybe that's all copacetic
[8931.04 --> 8932.80]  only cannibalism in moderation
[8932.80 --> 8933.80]  uh
[8933.80 --> 8935.54]  yeah don't take more than your fair share
[8935.54 --> 8940.60]  oh man
[8940.60 --> 8941.62]  anyway um
[8941.62 --> 8942.80]  well i think that's very reasonable
[8942.80 --> 8944.44]  cool
[8944.44 --> 8944.84]  yeah
[8944.84 --> 8945.90]  what's next
[8945.90 --> 8946.72]  uh
[8946.72 --> 8947.62]  geez i don't know
[8947.62 --> 8952.10]  uh currently watching live surrounded by a 40-foot video wall at times square
[8952.10 --> 8952.54]  nice
[8952.54 --> 8954.76]  linus what's your limit on display sizes
[8954.76 --> 8957.70]  if tcl makes a 200-inch tv will you get one
[8957.70 --> 8960.02]  i won't have a big enough room for one
[8960.02 --> 8964.60]  the limit on display sizes is dictated by your space
[8964.60 --> 8965.24]  i think
[8965.24 --> 8967.08]  um
[8967.08 --> 8974.82]  the the smallest samsung wall last time around when i was like when i was looking into it and i was like oh i kind of want one
[8974.82 --> 8975.24]  yeah
[8975.24 --> 8977.22]  i think it was 143 inches
[8977.22 --> 8980.44]  and the issue for me was that
[8980.44 --> 8982.28]  at 16 by 9
[8982.28 --> 8984.86]  that was kind of too big for my space
[8984.86 --> 8987.72]  at a wider aspect ratio
[8987.72 --> 8989.88]  143 inches would probably be fine
[8989.88 --> 8995.22]  because as it turns out and we learned this when we set up the the big display
[8995.22 --> 8999.80]  um as it turns out the wider you go the shockingly
[8999.80 --> 9002.70]  little difference there is between
[9002.70 --> 9009.20]  the one uh part of that right angle triangle or the the bottom of the right angle triangle and the diagonal
[9009.20 --> 9015.16]  yeah like our the difference between our diagonal and our bottom was only like three feet or something like that at that width
[9015.16 --> 9016.18]  um
[9016.18 --> 9018.82]  so i could probably handle like 140
[9018.82 --> 9023.96]  150 inch display if it was a wider aspect ratio but if i had to go 16 by 9
[9023.96 --> 9030.98]  120 to 130 is probably about as big as i can go in that theater room which seats comfortably about
[9030.98 --> 9040.38]  seven to nine people um so if you were to have if you had a larger room like i sat in this amazing theater room
[9040.38 --> 9041.88]  virtually
[9041.88 --> 9045.18]  in the uh in the big screen beyond app
[9045.18 --> 9049.48]  that was like it was like set up like you were a mega baller and you had like
[9049.48 --> 9054.34]  a theater room to hold your like orgies in or something like it was enormous and had all this
[9054.34 --> 9060.48]  like soft tiered seating everywhere and everything it's very relatable yeah exactly uh anyway
[9060.48 --> 9068.14]  sitting in there i was like i would need a 150 to 200 inch display at the front of this for it to
[9068.14 --> 9073.38]  for it to be big enough that everyone could enjoy it and an open relationship um that too
[9073.38 --> 9080.12]  it's very progressive that's all luke's is this show over yet
[9080.12 --> 9086.38]  luke doesn't spend money on anything but that that's why that's why you can't buy anything
[9086.38 --> 9096.98]  oh boy anyway yeah i i think that for for most reasonable sized rooms we're there
[9096.98 --> 9101.98]  and talking to display manufacturers they seem to be kind of acknowledging that like
[9101.98 --> 9109.56]  hisense seems to really envision itself as competing more in the premium space rather than competing in
[9109.56 --> 9115.30]  the big but cheap space because that's not going to be a space that really exists anymore in a little
[9115.30 --> 9120.22]  while everyone's just going to have a big affordable tv yeah so you better get real good real fast
[9120.22 --> 9128.48]  the good news is man though that was good for us that 100 inches are one 110 yeah the 110 inch
[9128.48 --> 9130.34]  that they had at ces looked amazing
[9130.34 --> 9140.48]  let's see what else we got hi ll dean i work at a laser tag facility and a few of us were given the
[9140.48 --> 9146.30]  opportunity to remodel our boss's office what would you put in terran's office and is there an item that
[9146.30 --> 9153.92]  you would recommend i get i mean if i was remodeling your boss's office i would definitely get some kind of
[9153.92 --> 9161.28]  like shark and suspend it from the ceiling with a freaking laser beam on its head but maybe that's
[9161.28 --> 9167.92]  just me that's actually perfect i love that just like like aquarium style you know with just the
[9167.92 --> 9172.68]  like the fishing line and you've just got this shark and it just has a freaking laser beam on its head
[9172.68 --> 9175.90]  that's what i want that's what i would want in that office everything else i don't even care
[9175.90 --> 9182.14]  but but like aquatic themed paint walls you know get some sponge on there gets a little bit of green in
[9182.14 --> 9186.70]  there get some seaweed decals and then get like a freaking laser beam shark and then everything's
[9186.70 --> 9192.16]  everything's everything else is gravy could do a mural on the wall with that then it'd be harder
[9192.16 --> 9195.68]  to remove as for what we would put in terran's office we actually have a video coming on that
[9195.68 --> 9201.80]  we took some suggestions from uh the community and we will be building him a pc worthy of a ceo
[9201.80 --> 9211.22]  oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy uh hey ltd love the show it's the first time catching it live
[9211.22 --> 9216.62]  and i thought i'd support oh my god you spent four hundred dollars you bought one of everything
[9216.62 --> 9223.50]  you don't have to do that you could you could watch it again in a bit and he bought two of one thing
[9223.50 --> 9230.24]  two bananas bananas bananas uh with the oh the gerald undone collab t-shirt it's a really cool shirt
[9230.24 --> 9235.44]  actually a notebook um the tablet one that one's a cool one you open it up and the pages have like
[9235.44 --> 9239.78]  it's like writing on a little tablet it's a little thing uh but a banana for scale in yellow
[9239.78 --> 9244.98]  a mystery 40 ounce water bottle a backpack and a screwdriver retro with a silver shaft very nice
[9244.98 --> 9251.72]  okay anyway uh thanks eric um what do you got linus are you tempted to daily drive the s24 ultra
[9251.72 --> 9257.56]  and luke have you played any sod i have not much but it's been pretty good what is it what is
[9257.56 --> 9263.06]  season of discovery i was gonna say soldier of destiny we were way off it's not bad though yeah
[9263.06 --> 9268.12]  very believable yeah i mean it's i was it's basically just soldier of fortune but with a d
[9268.12 --> 9274.12]  oh yeah destiny i don't know it doesn't matter the point is um yeah i'm pretty tempted by the s24 ultra
[9274.12 --> 9281.04]  i i'm i've been not missing the fold as much as i thought i would uh speaking of which dan i finally
[9281.04 --> 9285.56]  wiped everything off of it and it's in my office you can just oh no i haven't well i copied everything
[9285.56 --> 9288.92]  off it i haven't wiped it but if you just remind me i know you said you wanted to try it so
[9288.92 --> 9296.06]  um sure it's yours you fixed it um oh that was my deal i told him he couldn't do it and then dan
[9296.06 --> 9300.60]  was like you can't tell me what to do and i was like that sounds like a dance fine if you can fix
[9300.60 --> 9305.26]  it you can have it i was i was actually like i just want to make sure that you can have your phone
[9305.26 --> 9309.90]  that you love back linus i don't mind that's very kind of you though no it was it was a lot more
[9309.90 --> 9314.98]  obsessive compulsive than that oh i had to i was gonna do it whether you wanted to i know or not i
[9314.98 --> 9321.02]  know every once in a while he'll he'll like we i have this chat called the the dan tasking chat
[9321.02 --> 9326.42]  that aj and i are in yeah because he gets asked to do like everything on the planet so we try to
[9326.42 --> 9332.02]  you know make sure that we're still aiming true um but every once in a while there'll there'll be some
[9332.02 --> 9337.64]  like electronic repair thing that'll come through and i'll be like does this make a ton of sense
[9337.64 --> 9345.42]  almost always it's no will it make dan super happy that doesn't matter for productivity of
[9345.42 --> 9350.60]  the business i'm about to make dan super super happy oh has anyone talked about the video that
[9350.60 --> 9356.68]  you and i are going to work together on no oh god no no luke have you approved to this i don't he
[9356.68 --> 9362.02]  doesn't have to yeah i know i know i'm allowed to get some unlimited without going through the proper
[9362.02 --> 9368.38]  channels it is my rule but you're gonna get out of free i'm scared now so um did you ever see that
[9368.38 --> 9375.00]  crt projector that ploof got for that video on a crt projector i don't think i did but i recommended
[9375.00 --> 9380.18]  chase get some for smash i grew up with a crt projector with the three tubes and we ended up
[9380.18 --> 9385.38]  selling it to some super smash brothers players because you get the crt latency but 12 feet across
[9385.38 --> 9391.84]  all right so let's talk about crt projectors for a minute actually no let's not talk about crt
[9391.84 --> 9399.58]  projectors let's talk about the right to repair okay we got actually a second one of those crt
[9399.58 --> 9407.50]  projectors um it had been stored outside and uh is in pretty challenging uh operational condition it
[9407.50 --> 9412.88]  still works a little bit but what's cool is unlike the first one we bought which was more expensive and
[9412.88 --> 9421.56]  definitely worked the second one we got came with a service manual oh and that service manual is about
[9421.56 --> 9430.62]  two inches nice and has literally everything beautiful every schematic for absolutely everything
[9430.62 --> 9435.30]  and i was kind of thinking you know what would be a really cool video is if
[9435.30 --> 9444.06]  we told the story of how we lost right to repair because right to repair isn't something we're asking for
[9444.06 --> 9454.78]  it's something that we deserve to have back we had it that was normal that was a thing expected yes
[9454.78 --> 9466.86]  and so and so i thought as a as a vehicle for that story we could use this this old sony crt projector
[9466.86 --> 9472.14]  that quite frankly dan i don't think is worth fixing even for tournaments at the land because it's too dim
[9472.14 --> 9478.56]  yeah you'd have to get a better one you have to get like a dark room yeah but but kind of sick though
[9478.56 --> 9488.16]  but we should fix it because we can and we should be able to is sort of the point that we're getting
[9488.16 --> 9493.40]  yeah and i i thought it'd be kind of cool to get some other prominent right to repair advocates and
[9493.40 --> 9500.26]  and sort of um and and so yeah so get so so dan your job would be to fix the projector
[9500.26 --> 9504.54]  with this incredible service manual and it don't worry it's not dead as a doornail
[9504.54 --> 9510.18]  it's a bit dead i would love to talk through my troubleshooting intuition as well
[9510.18 --> 9516.70]  sure kind of is what allows me to fix the things and there's also a bloke that we are in touch with
[9516.70 --> 9522.94]  who did a video fixing one of these a little while ago and um it would i think it might be kind of a
[9522.94 --> 9528.64]  cool opportunity for a collab there so there's a lot of synergies you know to use a crappy horrible
[9528.64 --> 9533.72]  solutions yeah business term but i thought i thought you'd be pretty into it yeah that does
[9533.72 --> 9538.80]  sound fun yeah so uh it's super fun so consider that something that we're we're going to do sometime
[9538.80 --> 9543.22]  sometime eventually we're not in a hurry because it's not like the thing's going to get any older
[9543.22 --> 9551.00]  or debtor but yeah when we when i saw that service manual man there's there's like schematics for
[9551.00 --> 9556.84]  everything absolutely everything like you could basically take the entire thing apart down to
[9556.84 --> 9562.34]  board level components and rebuild it because the cost was because all that stuff was expensive
[9562.34 --> 9567.80]  not because f*** you it's proprietary and you can't build one yourself because we won't show you how
[9567.80 --> 9571.14]  you can't put it back together yourself because we won't show you how because f*** you
[9571.14 --> 9577.98]  like just a totally totally different industry philosophy that's kind of what i grew up with as
[9577.98 --> 9585.30]  well that's what my dad did is he repaired crt tvs um and vcrs and things like that and he would do
[9585.30 --> 9591.64]  those board level repairs um he still does that now for like you know word of mouth type repair stuff but
[9591.64 --> 9597.60]  in the early days they were simpler and you could ask the company for schematics um there's even some
[9597.60 --> 9602.08]  high-end audio gear because he does studio audio gear repair because a lot of it's still vintage
[9602.08 --> 9607.68]  analog extremely boutique niche stuff and some companies you'll you'll message and be like hey your
[9607.68 --> 9612.66]  thing's broken i'm a service tech here got any info for me and they'll send you all the service manuals
[9612.66 --> 9619.44]  and spare parts and that's schematics and then i know one company it's universal audio it just won't
[9619.44 --> 9625.88]  won't even talk to you oh you got to send it back it's it's like a fifteen thousand dollar piece of
[9625.88 --> 9629.44]  vintage audio equipment and they're just like we give it back like i'm not gonna i'm not gonna send
[9629.44 --> 9634.38]  it to you the air shipping is too dangerous not reasonable it also weighs a hundred pounds so
[9634.38 --> 9641.00]  anyway yes um i am tempted by the s24 ultra and also all that other stuff we just talked about
[9641.00 --> 9652.54]  uh i guess this is the last one nope i'm on the wrong page uh really happy to see you guys are
[9652.54 --> 9659.12]  selling ptm 7950 so much easier to get this way my question is did you have plans to buy and sell this
[9659.12 --> 9665.92]  since the video on it or is this a much more recent idea you'd be amazed how long things take to like do
[9665.92 --> 9673.12]  properly like we had to figure figuring out how to get them cut who is going to cut it honeywell no
[9673.12 --> 9680.96]  because if they did we're not really buying them in bulk anymore are we um so i think the the the the
[9680.96 --> 9685.84]  how do they come i think the full size sheets are like four of these okay and then they're flat
[9685.84 --> 9692.48]  packed those would have been like whatever it's like two hundred dollars or something and so no no
[9692.48 --> 9698.00]  oh it's like very oem it's just like bulk so we had to figure out okay well how do we do this i was
[9698.00 --> 9703.68]  just wondering is it a roll no or is it a stack it's it's a stack of flat packed things uh so we had
[9703.68 --> 9708.48]  to figure out like how how to cut them we had to create installation guides we had to create packaging
[9708.48 --> 9713.76]  and we had to we had to source it sourcing it took a long time because honeywell just straight up didn't
[9713.76 --> 9720.72]  return our emails like sorry who the are you like they don't care um so it was it was after the
[9720.72 --> 9726.40]  community uh brought up the idea that because this stuff was kind of hard to get your hands on as an
[9726.40 --> 9731.52]  end user at a reasonable price that we should source it and we should sell it so we did that took a long
[9731.52 --> 9740.56]  time but hey it's there now exciting hey ll and d seeing as you design and produce so many products
[9740.56 --> 9747.44]  what if any inter product consideration and testing do you do how things look fit work together etc
[9747.44 --> 9754.00]  a lot i mean the pants i'm wearing right now um oh look at that i have a screwdriver in it
[9755.28 --> 9760.56]  have a pocket that is specifically designed to hold a tool and that we obviously validated with our
[9760.56 --> 9764.16]  screwdriver this is an early prototype that the screwdriver actually doesn't fit very well into
[9764.16 --> 9769.36]  but that's why we do these things in it yeah um and those prototypes and we made sure that with our
[9769.36 --> 9774.64]  screwdriver it doesn't stab you when you sit down it's like at a so we had to make sure that the
[9774.64 --> 9781.36]  pocket was at a reasonable height so that it wouldn't just like jab you in the in the gut uh regardless
[9781.36 --> 9785.20]  of how you put it in so it won't stab you if it's uh blade side up with a bit installed either
[9785.20 --> 9796.96]  um so same called blade side i think so is it not i think so i don't know uh now i need to look it up
[9799.52 --> 9802.56]  bit side shaft side
[9804.96 --> 9808.24]  the business end side yeah at least someone calls it a blade
[9808.24 --> 9816.32]  yeah sure yeah i don't know i just never heard that so i wasn't sure what is a blade screwdriver
[9818.00 --> 9823.28]  oh for crying out loud still used to drive a slotted screw head is called a standard common blade
[9823.28 --> 9827.84]  flat blade slot head straight oh that's just for slot heads though i don't know this isn't a slot
[9829.36 --> 9835.36]  it's phillips screwdriver blade yeah all right i don't know there might be other there might be other
[9835.36 --> 9839.84]  words for it but no i didn't know any other word i was just surprised it was called blade when it's not
[9839.84 --> 9848.24]  a yeah anyways and last one i've got a high wanda dl what's the status of the expensive fidget toy made
[9848.24 --> 9853.68]  from screwdriver ratchet and precision screwdriver ball bearings i'd like to give you my money for that
[9853.68 --> 9859.76]  please purgatory there's only so many projects we can work on at a time and it hasn't been a priority
[9859.76 --> 9864.88]  i'm sorry you'll have to spend your 25 gift card on something else
[9866.96 --> 9873.68]  awkward anywho i think that's it for the show today thank you guys very much for tuning in uh
