for question at timestamp 1:11:10
Know where you are now...Know where you wanna be....and trust your instincts and know you will make it there. While SOME level of future planning is needed for survival MOST future planning for most people come in the form of trying to figure everything at once. if you stay planning for the future too much you are never in the here and now. find your center, and stay in the present moment. avoid solutions to problems that may or may not ever exist. here and now is the only thing that exists. the in between is an always changing thing.

I know this is kind of burried late in the show but I love the open discussions about the lab and decission making processes by Linus and other members of the team. (in this case around this timestamp https://youtu.be/s2nVwrJMSUQ?t=11970)
This is overall one of my favourite WAN shows to date.
