[0.00 → 4.58] Welcome to the WAN show! We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[4.92 → 14.00] Nvidia just announced day passes for GeForce now, with one day of their game streaming service costing you as...
[14.00 → 18.92] As much as $8 for a single day?
[19.94 → 22.82] Who do they think they are? Wait, no, they know who they are.
[22.90 → 25.30] They're the like, $2 trillion... Okay, whatever.
[25.30 → 33.28] The point is, we're also going to be talking about the big news that took place just after the WAN show ended last week,
[33.36 → 40.66] which is the makers of You, the Nintendo Switch emulator, settling with Nintendo, shutting down their emulators,
[41.08 → 45.14] and sending shockwaves through the emulation community. What else we got this week, Luke?
[45.40 → 52.32] Warner Bros. shuts down Rooster Teeth and D-List adult swim games off of Steam, and potentially other places, but definitely Steam.
[52.32 → 57.72] And also, we have a... We bought a CT scanner?
[58.54 → 58.92] Oh.
[59.94 → 60.84] That's crazy.
[61.10 → 62.70] It's pretty cool.
[63.22 → 66.64] Yeah. I mean, I'm looking at some of the stuff it's produced.
[67.38 → 68.48] We'll talk about that.
[68.48 → 81.90] That got the most reactions. We should just title the show, like, we bought a CT scanner.
[84.06 → 85.30] Bot is a strong word.
[85.82 → 86.16] Ah.
[89.22 → 92.76] The show is brought to you by AG1, Oracle, and Squarespace.
[92.76 → 95.94] Let's jump right into our headline topic.
[96.10 → 99.18] GeForce Now just got a pretty significant upgrade.
[99.64 → 101.30] It now... Wait, is this not in the thing?
[101.84 → 102.22] Uh, but...
[102.22 → 102.70] No.
[102.92 → 103.12] What?
[103.38 → 104.36] Okay. Well, whatever.
[104.68 → 109.46] The point is that GeForce Now supports variable refresh rate.
[109.80 → 109.94] Oh.
[109.94 → 114.82] Which, I have to confess, having not been briefed on this by anyone at NVIDIA,
[114.82 → 120.96] or done any research into it whatsoever, I have no idea how that would work.
[121.18 → 128.46] Knowing that in order for your monitor to know what refresh rate to run at,
[128.52 → 133.68] it talks to your GPU, and the fact that your GPU is streaming over that there internet,
[134.06 → 136.18] um, pretty freaking cool.
[136.18 → 142.54] Now, it sort of seems like it might have something to do with NVIDIA's own drivers,
[142.78 → 150.44] because right now, variable refresh rate is limited to people who are running a relatively modern NVIDIA GPU.
[151.14 → 156.78] So, GTX 1650, RTX 2000 and up,
[157.16 → 161.08] which sort of raises the question of why you're paying for GeForce Now in the first place,
[161.10 → 162.94] because you already have a decent GPU.
[162.94 → 168.96] But then, hold on, that theory gets kind of thrown in the garbage and, uh, lit on fire
[168.96 → 172.04] the second that you realize that on a Mac,
[172.62 → 178.22] you have support for variable refresh rate on Apple GPUs,
[178.26 → 181.34] or, get this, AMD GPUs.
[181.60 → 181.92] Oh.
[182.02 → 183.60] On the older Intel-based Macs.
[183.98 → 184.40] So...
[184.40 → 185.00] What the heck?
[185.08 → 189.02] That would seem to suggest that NVIDIA is just kind of arbitrarily...
[189.02 → 189.30] Yeah.
[189.30 → 193.16] Locking Windows users who don't have GeForce GPUs
[193.16 → 197.02] into fixed refresh rate operation on GeForce Now.
[197.22 → 202.42] Then again, you know, if the market share numbers that I was just looking at earlier this week
[202.42 → 205.78] or anything to go by, that's basically nobody.
[205.78 → 206.84] Might not matter, yeah.
[206.94 → 212.14] NVIDIA's market share in the discrete GPU space is unbelievable.
[212.14 → 219.60] And what's really wild about it right now is AMD has a pretty competitive lineup.
[219.78 → 224.60] If you're not looking at ray tracing, if you're not looking at, um, you know...
[224.60 → 225.52] Which most people aren't.
[225.62 → 229.88] AI-powered frame generation where they do still have a significant advantage.
[229.94 → 230.90] People do care about that.
[231.66 → 232.16] They do.
[232.40 → 232.60] Yeah.
[232.72 → 233.00] They do.
[233.00 → 234.74] That one, the ray tracing part, eh.
[234.90 → 235.52] But if you...
[235.52 → 239.96] But if you mostly care about rasterized gaming performance, traditional gaming performance,
[240.10 → 244.98] AMD actually has a pretty competitive lineup between their older 6000 series and their newer
[244.98 → 246.38] 7000 series cards.
[246.50 → 252.32] I will say, though, if you look at, like, settings, guides for games, everyone's turning
[252.32 → 253.32] that stuff on these days.
[254.30 → 254.70] Everybody.
[255.24 → 255.62] Yep.
[256.46 → 258.04] And it kind of makes sense.
[258.18 → 258.36] Yeah.
[258.36 → 266.34] Um, anywho, it is now $10 a month and that gets you a premium rig with RTX on, up to 1080p
[266.34 → 271.32] resolution, up to 60fps, and up to a six-hour session length, though you can start a new
[271.32 → 272.34] session at any time.
[272.50 → 272.88] Weird.
[273.12 → 274.52] Well, I get it.
[274.78 → 275.26] I mean...
[275.26 → 276.06] Just in case you're idling?
[276.06 → 287.70] Let's say you were a popular, you know, streamer slash YouTuber and were gaming when your heart
[287.70 → 289.24] unexpectedly stopped beating.
[289.58 → 295.92] Well, then this way, uh, GeForce now or NVIDIA would not be on the hook for streaming all that
[295.92 → 299.14] game data over the course of an entire weekend.
[301.30 → 301.98] Sure.
[303.08 → 305.22] It's not hypothetical.
[305.60 → 305.88] Oh.
[306.06 → 307.80] Wow.
[308.86 → 309.84] This guy knows.
[310.10 → 310.78] I don't.
[311.52 → 312.56] It was a whole thing.
[312.78 → 313.08] Wow.
[313.44 → 313.90] Oh, boy.
[314.20 → 316.22] So, anywho, the point is that...
[316.22 → 316.54] Oh!
[317.34 → 322.88] ... Ultimate is $20 a month and gets you an RTX 4080 rig...
[322.88 → 323.64] I'm up to speed.
[323.76 → 329.18] ...with RTX on, up to 4K resolution, up to 120fps, and eight-hour session lengths.
[329.32 → 331.96] I really don't see the six-hour session length as...
[331.96 → 333.84] Yeah, why is there a differentiator here?
[333.84 → 335.60] That big of a problem in the first place.
[335.60 → 340.64] But hey, you can game for eight hours straight with GeForce now Ultimate.
[340.64 → 343.92] It's the weird part to me is that it's only two more hours?
[344.42 → 345.42] Of course.
[345.56 → 346.12] Of course.
[346.24 → 348.42] None of this is what I'm upset about.
[348.60 → 349.96] All of that is pretty cool.
[350.06 → 353.70] There are some limitations around the variable refresh rate support.
[353.70 → 357.28] I don't believe it works with multi-monitors, for example.
[357.76 → 361.18] But, overall, I think that is super cool.
[361.52 → 366.32] The thing that I'm kind of butt hurt about is their priority day passes.
[366.32 → 372.04] Now, in fairness to NVIDIA, okay?
[372.04 → 381.78] In fairness to NVIDIA, I am not super supportive of the, you know, the free month concept.
[382.10 → 382.22] Okay.
[382.22 → 384.98] Give us your credit card, and you get a free month.
[385.18 → 385.30] Yeah.
[385.30 → 389.52] However, I don't think that this is the solution.
[390.32 → 391.02] A priority...
[391.02 → 391.30] Business question?
[392.12 → 392.60] Yes.
[392.76 → 394.08] Would you enable that for Flow plane?
[394.30 → 395.76] If there were trials on Flow plane?
[396.76 → 397.04] Yeah.
[397.80 → 399.08] You said you're not a huge fan?
[399.28 → 399.68] I'm not.
[400.40 → 400.92] Sounds good.
[400.92 → 402.92] Sorry.
[403.22 → 409.06] It's well enough established practice at this point that I'm looking at it going, as long
[409.06 → 410.56] as it's very easy to cancel.
[410.80 → 411.76] And super transparent.
[411.84 → 412.50] That's our bar.
[412.88 → 416.86] So, when we're working with sponsors, for example, sometimes community members will flag
[416.86 → 420.68] for us that a service is difficult to cancel.
[420.68 → 421.88] Dark patterns, whatever else.
[421.98 → 422.46] Exactly.
[422.72 → 422.96] Yeah, yeah.
[423.14 → 425.06] And that's where I draw the line.
[425.06 → 430.90] Whereas, a free trial is a free trial, especially if it gives you very real access to the service.
[431.06 → 436.74] And in our case, this isn't the kind of service that is effectively useless for the trial period.
[437.28 → 441.06] Like, you know, you look at some services, like, here, I'll pick on a long-time sponsor.
[441.14 → 441.88] I'll pick on Squarespace.
[442.68 → 445.12] Squarespace, their trial exists.
[445.28 → 445.76] Oh, yeah.
[445.76 → 450.02] Not so you can actually, like, have a website for any amount of time.
[450.02 → 451.56] You kind of set it up and see if you're satisfied.
[451.58 → 453.54] So you can link around with it a little bit.
[454.18 → 454.48] Right?
[454.48 → 456.42] So, something like that.
[456.54 → 456.94] You know, honestly.
[457.38 → 461.40] Someone could, if we had a trial period, someone could queue download the entire site.
[461.60 → 466.72] If Squarespace had a paid trial, I believe their trial is free.
[467.22 → 471.86] So, if Squarespace had a paid trial, you know, I'd be a little annoyed by that.
[472.22 → 473.04] Let me just see.
[473.18 → 474.66] Yeah, get your trial started.
[474.74 → 475.76] No credit card required.
[476.20 → 482.02] So, because theirs is kind of useless during the trial period, they're doing the right thing
[482.02 → 483.22] and the trial is free.
[483.22 → 489.14] So, for our part, if we're giving, if we're taking payment information, my expectation is
[489.14 → 494.30] that the service is very unfettered usable during that time.
[494.40 → 494.50] Yeah.
[494.50 → 497.62] So, I don't know that we would offer a one-month trial.
[497.70 → 498.86] Maybe we'd offer a shorter trial.
[499.00 → 499.08] No.
[499.08 → 500.42] But what I can say is...
[500.42 → 501.28] I'm thinking like a week or less.
[501.36 → 503.40] We probably wouldn't be doing this.
[504.06 → 512.28] For a one-day pass for the regular tier, or the priority tier, priority day pass, you're
[512.28 → 513.16] going to pay $4.
[513.16 → 513.46] $4.
[514.46 → 519.52] Which, I guess is fine, except that a full month is $10.
[520.88 → 525.84] What exactly is NVIDIA trying to achieve here with a $4 date?
[525.84 → 533.62] Okay, so Ultimate is going to cost you $8 compared to $20 a month.
[535.20 → 544.18] Why would anyone in their right mind pay 40% of the price of an entire month for one day?
[544.18 → 554.26] And, again, in fairness to NVIDIA, I'm not a huge fan of the whole take your credit card now and then hope you forget about the subscription model.
[554.48 → 555.92] It's become the standard...
[555.92 → 556.88] You know what would be cool, actually?
[556.88 → 559.08] But everyone knows why they do that.
[559.46 → 561.16] And this is something...
[561.16 → 561.94] But why not just...
[561.94 → 563.02] I mean, it's obvious...
[563.02 → 563.76] It's just...
[563.76 → 564.94] Who cares?
[565.38 → 567.62] It should be $1 or $2.
[568.20 → 570.44] This idea is free, and I love this idea.
[570.52 → 570.76] Sure.
[570.76 → 574.24] What if it contributed towards your first month?
[577.64 → 580.84] I would be far more okay with that.
[581.64 → 582.70] But I also...
[582.70 → 588.54] It's a pretty brutal percentage, but if you do subscribe for the month, it's like, well, I got to try it now.
[588.78 → 592.14] I still feel like it should be cheaper, but I would like it if it contributed towards...
[592.14 → 594.24] Honestly, I think it should just be...
[594.24 → 597.24] I would be happier with a free month trial.
[597.34 → 598.16] It shouldn't be $1.
[598.40 → 598.74] It's too cheap.
[598.74 → 604.90] Or just have me subscribe for the full month and prorate me a partial refund if I'm not happy with it or something.
[605.70 → 606.62] Like, I just...
[606.62 → 607.10] I just...
[607.10 → 608.16] If the idea...
[608.16 → 610.72] I just don't really understand what NVIDIA is trying to achieve here.
[610.72 → 620.38] If the idea was to create a very low barrier of entry so that I can try it before I buy it, then it should actually be cheap.
[620.38 → 620.56] The barrier's too high.
[620.84 → 620.94] Yeah.
[621.06 → 621.66] The barrier's way too high.
[621.66 → 623.90] I think they don't want to process a bunch of $2 payments.
[623.90 → 633.66] Which is fair enough, but if processing that $2 payment locks someone into a subscription, if it turns them into a subscribing customer, mission freaking accomplished.
[634.32 → 648.52] And I can understand NVIDIA not wanting to just give away GeForce Now because it, as we know, is extremely expensive for them to run, both in terms of processing, like actual power, and in terms of bandwidth.
[648.52 → 653.18] This is a very premium service, even on NVIDIA's side.
[653.26 → 654.32] Their costs are high.
[654.68 → 658.02] So I get that they want to cover the costs, and they don't want to do free trials.
[658.02 → 663.36] But this is such a weird non-solution that I just...
[663.36 → 671.38] I'm having a hard time imagining the sort of the penny-pinching that was going on in the board meeting where they were making this decision.
[671.38 → 681.70] Like, are they actually worried that on a one-day pass, someone is going to do, you know, four six-hour sessions in a row to, like, to really get the maximum out of it?
[681.70 → 686.24] And so they have to charge $4 versus a buck or...
[686.24 → 688.16] Like, come on, you guys.
[688.84 → 701.48] If the idea is just to get the credit card, which realistically, from a marketing standpoint, is 90% of the battle is getting someone to create an account and enter their credit card.
[701.50 → 702.24] There's a free tier.
[702.46 → 704.54] That's worth the few dollars.
[704.80 → 706.06] Yeah, it's ad-supported.
[706.56 → 706.80] Yeah.
[706.80 → 716.66] So, realistically, is it really your concern that you're going to lose money on people who want to try priority and ultimate if you don't charge them enough?
[720.76 → 725.56] I can't really follow.
[726.50 → 728.52] I just don't really follow.
[728.60 → 730.82] Yeah, we've got people saying, like, the four bucks should get you a week.
[730.82 → 736.40] Yeah, if $10 is a month, I could totally see $4 being a week.
[736.80 → 743.78] And then, at least, we're kind of talking about people kind of paying approximately the same amount per time used.
[744.12 → 749.96] And we're talking about a period of time when you could actually potentially, you know, when you have a vacation, binge a game.
[750.30 → 751.76] Like, it's actually useful.
[752.92 → 753.20] Where...
[753.20 → 754.34] $4 for...
[754.34 → 754.70] I don't know.
[754.80 → 756.20] I just...
[756.20 → 759.16] I have nothing else to say other than that I just don't really get it.
[759.44 → 760.88] I think it should be a lower price.
[761.96 → 763.40] Yeah, it should be a lower price.
[763.40 → 765.62] The day pass idea, I actually love.
[766.12 → 767.56] I think that's really cool.
[767.98 → 771.22] If we could do a float plane day pass, I'd be super into that.
[771.30 → 774.40] We haven't built the mechanisms for trials and for...
[774.40 → 776.54] I don't think it works very well for our service, to be completely honest.
[777.18 → 777.74] I mean, it could.
[777.88 → 778.54] I don't think you could...
[778.54 → 779.78] Unless it doesn't include download.
[779.98 → 780.76] I think...
[780.76 → 781.04] Yeah.
[782.88 → 784.08] Yeah, something like that could work.
[784.10 → 784.62] It might be all right.
[784.84 → 785.06] Yeah.
[785.06 → 791.00] There's definitely some stuff that we need to explore in terms of driving people to float
[791.00 → 791.16] plane.
[791.22 → 792.64] We're going to be trying something new today.
[793.48 → 794.62] We're going to be doing...
[794.62 → 794.88] Are we?
[794.94 → 795.28] Hopefully.
[796.30 → 796.80] Are we not?
[797.24 → 797.70] Doing what?
[798.88 → 800.30] Float plane exclusive after party.
[800.56 → 801.30] Oh, okay.
[801.48 → 801.64] Yeah.
[801.70 → 802.78] We're playing super checks.
[803.08 → 804.70] I already forgot about that.
[805.44 → 805.62] I'm down.
[805.62 → 807.26] That was like six minutes ago.
[807.26 → 807.28] I'm super down.
[807.28 → 807.32] I'm down.
[807.32 → 814.76] I immediately started to think that like some feature launch or something.
[814.86 → 815.68] I was like, oh no.
[816.84 → 818.26] What am I not ready for?
[818.26 → 819.76] We're back to Linus-led development.
[819.90 → 820.26] Yeah.
[822.98 → 823.98] Oh man.
[824.52 → 825.76] The fear in his eyes.
[825.88 → 826.10] Yeah.
[826.40 → 829.04] I legitimately was like, what am I not ready for?
[829.16 → 830.16] I don't know.
[830.16 → 833.24] You actually looked extremely frightened.
[834.54 → 836.58] I lulled inside.
[836.58 → 837.40] Oh man.
[838.82 → 839.48] All right.
[839.52 → 842.50] Why don't we jump into our next thing that we're supposed to do?
[842.58 → 843.12] Dan, help me.
[843.24 → 844.16] Topic number two.
[844.26 → 845.14] Luke, you want to pick it?
[845.50 → 845.80] Sure.
[846.26 → 846.46] Yeah.
[848.26 → 849.46] Index finger or pinky?
[851.60 → 853.44] I asked if you want to pick it.
[854.70 → 855.04] Why?
[855.16 → 855.74] Oh, really?
[855.94 → 856.50] Really, Luke?
[857.16 → 858.84] It's a little early on the show to go there.
[860.44 → 861.60] Twitch is still watching.
[862.44 → 864.04] They're sensitive virgin eyes.
[864.18 → 864.34] They're not.
[864.34 → 865.98] They haven't been sent to bed yet.
[866.58 → 868.42] Let's do You.
[870.04 → 870.46] I think.
[870.68 → 871.30] Let's do You.
[871.50 → 871.62] Yeah.
[871.96 → 872.16] Yeah.
[872.58 → 877.50] Makers of You shut down emulators, telemetry data, worries, and other shockwaves through
[877.50 → 878.52] the emulation community.
[878.82 → 880.02] A week after Nintendo...
[880.02 → 880.76] Just a week.
[880.86 → 882.82] This is like the craziest part to me.
[882.96 → 883.12] Yeah.
[883.12 → 888.24] A week after Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Tropic Haze LLC, the makers of You Switch
[888.24 → 894.46] emulation software, Tropic Haze has agreed to settle the case by paying Nintendo $2.4 million
[894.46 → 897.30] and ceasing distribution of the emulator.
[897.54 → 899.04] Man, that happened fast.
[899.30 → 900.80] That was lightning fast.
[900.80 → 907.20] There is no way that this wasn't all kind of going on behind the scenes at that point.
[907.20 → 907.68] Yeah.
[908.68 → 913.64] You, some observers have speculated that the devs may have settled to avoid discovery,
[913.64 → 918.54] which may have verified claims that the You team dumped and shared games between themselves
[918.54 → 924.12] or helped get Switch games up and running on You before their official launch date.
[924.70 → 928.18] You apparently had telemetry that logged a lot of information.
[928.62 → 932.88] And now that all devices and hard drives owned by the LLC are now in the hands of Nintendo,
[933.30 → 937.84] leading to fears that they may take further action against the emulator's user base.
[939.92 → 941.20] Oh boy!
[941.50 → 942.02] Oh boy.
[942.02 → 943.86] Why did that telemetry data need to get logged?
[943.86 → 951.46] As an additional result of the lawsuit, Tropic Haze has also discontinued support of the 3DS emulator CTRA.
[952.88 → 954.90] The discussion has caused a wave of chaos.
[955.14 → 955.24] Decision.
[955.68 → 956.76] Yeah, there we go.
[957.02 → 959.66] The decision has caused a wave of chaos in the emulation community.
[959.94 → 963.86] The official Discord channel of You's competitor Ruins...
[964.70 → 965.30] Ruins.
[965.54 → 966.32] Ruins, okay.
[966.32 → 972.70] Had to temporarily stop accepting invites in response to the influx of users from the You Discord server.
[972.70 → 977.10] A popular Discord server for the Steam Deck, for the time being at least,
[977.38 → 981.94] shut down its entire emulation channel to prevent potential legal repercussions.
[982.98 → 986.28] The developer of popular Nintendo DS emulator, Drastic,
[986.76 → 992.46] stopped charging for the software on the Google Play Store and intends to pull it down and open its source,
[992.56 → 996.82] a decision made more urgent by the You settlement.
[996.82 → 1002.88] Our discussion question is, what will the results of this decision be,
[1003.02 → 1006.54] and should emulator users and developers be concerned?
[1006.72 → 1009.82] I mean, we're not legal experts...
[1009.82 → 1010.14] No.
[1010.28 → 1013.04] ...when it comes to emulation, or realistically anything.
[1013.26 → 1013.44] Yep.
[1013.56 → 1013.76] Yep.
[1013.76 → 1014.40] I was going there.
[1014.50 → 1014.94] I was going there.
[1014.94 → 1018.18] So take all of this as not legal advice.
[1018.44 → 1019.14] These are...
[1019.14 → 1019.38] Yeah.
[1019.76 → 1027.98] But it's been pretty clear for a long time that emulation is very, very murky legally.
[1027.98 → 1028.16] Yes.
[1028.16 → 1033.16] It's heavily dependent on the region that you're in, on the region that you are defending yourself against.
[1033.16 → 1036.34] Everyone likes to thump that emulation is legal, but it's like...
[1036.34 → 1041.78] Some aspects of that are somewhat proven out.
[1042.16 → 1044.92] Some aspects of that are not as proven out.
[1045.12 → 1052.70] And as we've seen recently, like looking at, in particular, a high-profile, long-standing decision
[1052.70 → 1056.44] that was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court somewhat recently,
[1056.44 → 1063.24] just because something has legal precedent for it doesn't necessarily mean that that can never be overturned.
[1063.24 → 1070.06] If there is sufficient pressure on the legal system, or if there is a new argument that can be presented
[1070.06 → 1076.30] in order to get it changed, I do think that there are probably regions where it is unlikely
[1076.30 → 1082.40] that an emulation developer would be at as much risk.
[1082.76 → 1089.66] But it is very clear that if, especially, you pursue any kind of monetary gain...
[1089.66 → 1089.98] Yes.
[1089.98 → 1093.58] ...through the development and distribution of any kind of copyrighted material,
[1093.80 → 1096.36] you are painting a target on your back and...
[1096.36 → 1096.80] A big one.
[1097.20 → 1098.50] ...you are going to be in trouble.
[1098.64 → 1105.50] I think that what Drastic is doing is probably a pretty smart defensive play.
[1105.98 → 1109.80] Open-sourcing it and sort of trying to...
[1109.80 → 1118.72] trying to make the target broader and less easy to go after,
[1118.86 → 1127.02] if it's just a community of open-source developers compared to an organization that is clearly
[1127.02 → 1129.54] making a significant amount of money.
[1129.62 → 1133.04] I mean, if you have $2.4 million to pay as a settlement,
[1133.48 → 1138.08] what I would assume is that that's somewhere near everything they had.
[1138.08 → 1138.98] Yeah.
[1138.98 → 1144.58] And that's probably the negotiation that has taken place over presumably the weeks or months
[1144.58 → 1149.40] that have led up to this announcement and then the subsequent announcement of the settlement.
[1149.62 → 1151.64] I bet you Nintendo wanted it to be fast.
[1152.52 → 1152.74] Probably.
[1152.74 → 1154.56] Because it shows that it's scary.
[1155.12 → 1156.80] How fast it happened is scary.
[1157.06 → 1157.92] Oh, absolutely.
[1157.92 → 1163.52] And I pretty much guarantee you a pretty significant portion of this was wanting to instill fear.
[1164.94 → 1165.58] Oh, yeah.
[1165.60 → 1166.84] They don't want people to do this.
[1167.12 → 1169.34] So they want to make an example.
[1169.92 → 1176.22] The thing that sort of baffles me right now is that Nintendo thinks that that will be successful.
[1177.24 → 1182.04] That people will maybe stop emulating games and emulating their systems.
[1182.04 → 1184.50] Totally will from a paid perspective.
[1184.58 → 1189.10] I think we're going to see a somewhat universal death of paid emulation.
[1190.16 → 1191.26] I don't think so.
[1191.38 → 1193.02] I think we might see that in some places.
[1193.02 → 1198.94] I mean, I think you're probably not considering what's going on in places like China,
[1199.08 → 1206.84] where you can buy easily, readily available systems that are completely jammed packed,
[1206.94 → 1209.28] full of emulators and pirated ROMs.
[1209.28 → 1212.40] So more in like somewhat legal havens.
[1212.84 → 1213.28] Yeah.
[1213.28 → 1213.48] Yeah.
[1213.80 → 1218.92] And that's the kind of thing where that, I mean, we've seen time and time again,
[1219.44 → 1223.24] just basically since the inception of the internet.
[1223.50 → 1225.44] You can't stomp out anything.
[1225.70 → 1225.72] Yeah.
[1225.82 → 1225.98] Yeah.
[1226.04 → 1226.22] Yeah.
[1226.40 → 1226.62] Yeah.
[1226.62 → 1227.90] You'll never completely get it.
[1227.98 → 1229.32] There's always somewhere it can hide.
[1229.44 → 1235.00] Whether it's, whether it's, you know, online black marketplaces or whether it's.
[1235.10 → 1238.42] We saw this with WoW private servers back in the day before they made WoW Classic.
[1238.42 → 1240.68] They would just bounce around at data centres.
[1240.84 → 1240.96] Yep.
[1241.02 → 1242.08] Oh, that one gets whacked.
[1242.18 → 1243.02] Another one comes up.
[1243.08 → 1243.20] Yep.
[1243.20 → 1244.98] It's probably a new group of people, whatever.
[1245.16 → 1246.06] They're still going to accept payments.
[1246.12 → 1246.86] They got to pay for servers.
[1247.04 → 1249.46] I mean, look, we discussed this a little while ago.
[1249.58 → 1251.18] This actually cropped up on the Subreddit.
[1251.24 → 1255.16] People were asking, well, why was Linus all talking about the pirate bay?
[1255.26 → 1256.48] Like, don't use the pirate bay.
[1256.48 → 1257.48] Yeah.
[1257.48 → 1260.92] And it's because the ownership has changed multiple times.
[1260.92 → 1261.14] Yeah.
[1261.14 → 1261.72] And there's.
[1262.00 → 1264.00] It's not, it's legitimately not what it used to be.
[1264.00 → 1266.38] It is actually not what it used to be.
[1266.38 → 1266.52] Yeah.
[1266.52 → 1268.78] And not run by the folks that used to run it.
[1268.86 → 1272.38] But what I can say about it is it's still there.
[1272.38 → 1285.26] I mean, the number of times that the pirate bay and the power of the entities who have tried to take down the pirate bay, the number of times they've shut it down only for it to crop back up again.
[1285.26 → 1285.56] Yeah.
[1285.70 → 1295.48] Is mind-boggling, especially when you consider the, the, the limited financial resources of a website.
[1296.38 → 1309.26] And, you know, they definitely ran ads that we know from experience have higher CPMs on them, you know, advertisers who won't get, you know, more legitimate sites to display their stuff.
[1310.38 → 1312.20] To be clear, we haven't actually run them.
[1312.26 → 1313.24] We've just seen offers.
[1313.24 → 1330.48] But still, still, it's, it's a it's finite resources, and you're going up against entities that have effectively infinite resources like the Motion Picture Association of America or the what's the RAA, Recording Industry Artists Association or something like that.
[1330.50 → 1332.50] I can't remember what RAA stands for.
[1332.96 → 1337.46] But these like gigantic American media organizations.
[1338.40 → 1340.00] Recording Industry Association of America.
[1340.20 → 1340.76] Thank you.
[1340.76 → 1344.84] But yeah, big deal.
[1344.94 → 1345.52] Huge deal.
[1345.64 → 1345.84] Yeah.
[1345.94 → 1353.34] I'm, I'm, I'm worried because I, I'm, I'm at the point, I'm at a point in my life now where I really do play, pay for the games I play.
[1353.48 → 1354.54] I don't.
[1354.58 → 1354.94] Me too.
[1355.66 → 1359.76] Legitimately do not remember the last time I pirated a game.
[1360.20 → 1362.48] I would have been still living at my parents' house, I think.
[1363.90 → 1364.50] Maybe not.
[1364.56 → 1365.32] I don't, I don't know either.
[1365.32 → 1367.08] No, probably not.
[1367.72 → 1368.74] Call of Duty 2.
[1370.78 → 1371.18] Okay.
[1371.28 → 1372.28] Let's look at Call of Duty 2.
[1372.28 → 1372.48] Wait.
[1372.90 → 1374.18] No, no, I didn't.
[1374.24 → 1381.54] I didn't pirate Call of Duty 2 because by then I was working at NCI and I got codes that.
[1381.54 → 1381.98] Um.
[1382.72 → 1384.90] Even if you did, that was 2005.
[1386.86 → 1388.14] Yeah, no, hold on a second.
[1388.26 → 1389.12] Was it COD 2?
[1389.76 → 1390.76] 19 years.
[1390.96 → 1391.22] Yeah.
[1391.32 → 1395.30] Anyway, the point is it's been a very, very long time.
[1395.46 → 1395.82] Long time.
[1396.02 → 1397.70] Basically since Steam got good.
[1397.92 → 1401.02] I, I could not afford to buy the games at all.
[1401.06 → 1404.22] It didn't, there was, there was no like it wasn't going to make a difference, and I was pirating games.
[1404.22 → 1406.50] And then I could afford to buy games and I bought games.
[1406.86 → 1415.62] So, as someone who has played Nintendo games on an emulator and owns every game that I played.
[1415.70 → 1420.28] I mean, look, I'm not going to pretend that I went through the rigmarole of ripping my games.
[1420.88 → 1421.28] Yeah.
[1421.68 → 1422.76] And ripping my BIOS.
[1422.90 → 1423.90] Not going to pretend that.
[1424.02 → 1425.18] You have a, uh.
[1425.56 → 1426.78] But I've got the cart.
[1426.90 → 1427.72] Got the cart, yeah.
[1427.84 → 1428.38] Got the cart.
[1428.68 → 1430.64] But I don't want to play on the Switch.
[1431.54 → 1432.92] It f***ING sucks.
[1432.92 → 1436.70] And so that's, honestly, that's my problem with all of this.
[1436.78 → 1440.22] I'm not even looking at it like, but my free games.
[1440.88 → 1442.22] Like, it's not about that.
[1442.26 → 1446.88] It's about, I want to, I want to play my games at 60 f***ING frames per second.
[1447.06 → 1448.32] That's Medawar's take as well.
[1448.40 → 1449.20] You guys have the same.
[1449.48 → 1449.86] Oh, really?
[1450.06 → 1450.24] Yeah.
[1450.38 → 1451.02] Oh, it's hilarious.
[1451.32 → 1452.56] He's just like, I want it to be better.
[1453.04 → 1453.36] Yeah.
[1453.64 → 1457.90] And if Nintendo, if, I even gave them, I gave them my f***ING money.
[1457.90 → 1460.36] Once for the Switch, second time for the Switch OLED.
[1461.04 → 1461.58] Give me.
[1461.58 → 1462.10] And the game.
[1462.10 → 1464.20] Give me a Switch 2 or a Switch Pro.
[1464.38 → 1465.58] I saw, I saw a rumour.
[1465.94 → 1467.78] I don't know what source it was from.
[1467.86 → 1473.56] I have no idea the credibility, but I saw a rumour that kind of lines up with other rumours
[1473.56 → 1479.58] about the upcoming Switch replacement that it's based on, I want to say, Turing.
[1479.80 → 1480.50] It's already going to be old.
[1480.64 → 1483.84] Um, where, where they were basically saying, yeah, the hardware has pretty much been done
[1483.84 → 1484.80] for like two years.
[1485.12 → 1489.70] Which kind of makes sense from a, from a development standpoint.
[1489.70 → 1491.94] Like if Nintendo's like, look, we don't want to rush this.
[1492.10 → 1496.24] We want to have dev kits that are basically finished hardware so that the games at launch
[1496.24 → 1498.42] have years to be developed and are awesome.
[1498.50 → 1498.62] Or what?
[1498.62 → 1499.60] Like, okay, I get it.
[1499.62 → 1499.90] I get it.
[1499.90 → 1500.24] I get it.
[1500.24 → 1500.30] I get it.
[1500.30 → 1502.24] Um, but like.
[1504.68 → 1505.40] Yeah.
[1506.68 → 1510.00] But it's like a seven.
[1510.00 → 1513.10] It's a seven-year-old console at this point.
[1513.64 → 1515.34] And it sucked when it came out.
[1515.40 → 1515.68] Yeah.
[1516.68 → 1517.92] Just give me something.
[1518.32 → 1519.62] It was weak at launch.
[1519.78 → 1520.16] Yeah.
[1521.36 → 1522.20] Like Nvidia.
[1522.60 → 1526.44] I remember Nvidia coming to the office at NCI and pitching.
[1526.62 → 1529.12] Do you remember Nvidia's super phones?
[1529.74 → 1529.90] Yeah.
[1530.62 → 1531.10] Yeah.
[1531.46 → 1532.16] I remember that.
[1532.42 → 1533.42] Super phones.
[1533.58 → 1533.84] Nvidia.
[1534.00 → 1536.96] Let's see if I can, let's see if I can find any materials.
[1537.48 → 1538.34] Oh my God.
[1538.34 → 1540.50] From super phones to super computers.
[1540.64 → 1541.20] What is this?
[1541.52 → 1542.78] What year is this from?
[1543.88 → 1551.94] Uh, but, but, but Nvidia fact sheet, uh, 1910 million Tegra's shipped.
[1552.28 → 1554.48] What am I even, what am I even looking at here?
[1554.54 → 1557.78] This is like, obviously ancient collateral.
[1558.88 → 1559.66] Uh, 2011.
[1560.22 → 1561.16] Let's go.
[1561.58 → 1561.90] Okay.
[1562.06 → 1566.62] So Nvidia had this super phones initiative around their Terra chips.
[1566.62 → 1573.32] And the idea was that they were going to power, you know, the computer, the PC, um, or sorry,
[1573.38 → 1578.34] they were going to power the data centre, uh, your pocket and everything in between.
[1578.84 → 1582.66] And, um, Terra kind of sucked.
[1582.66 → 1586.58] Like on the GPU side of things, it was, it was good.
[1586.66 → 1587.22] It was solid.
[1587.56 → 1591.02] Uh, but the, the CPU was not competitive at the time.
[1591.02 → 1599.00] And Nvidia wasn't able to iterate on it fast enough and get enough design wins to put the R&D back into it to, to get the cycle going.
[1599.04 → 1601.18] It just never, it never snowballed.
[1601.18 → 1615.08] Um, and a few years later, out came the Nintendo Switch with this, like, kind of crappy when it was launched, which was years prior mobile chip in it.
[1615.14 → 1618.26] And it's like, Oh, please.
[1618.26 → 1620.08] Anyway.
[1621.66 → 1623.14] Yeah, this sucks.
[1623.34 → 1627.52] This sucks because, uh, my issue is not paying for games.
[1627.90 → 1637.72] My issue is wanting the games that I play to be the best possible experience and Nintendo having no interest in that whatsoever.
[1637.72 → 1638.72] Yeah.
[1638.86 → 1645.48] I mean, even just the fact that you're, that your save games are locked to the switch with no way to export them.
[1645.48 → 1648.24] And the only way to back them up being a monthly subscription.
[1648.54 → 1649.62] I've said it once.
[1649.72 → 1650.66] I'll say it again.
[1651.02 → 1653.80] F*** off Nintendo with that bulls***.
[1654.62 → 1655.88] I'm not into it.
[1657.76 → 1659.24] Why do I keep giving them money?
[1662.54 → 1664.12] Because unfortunately they make good games.
[1666.52 → 1666.96] Yeah.
[1667.72 → 1668.74] They do though.
[1668.88 → 1669.12] Yeah.
[1669.46 → 1670.10] They really do.
[1670.22 → 1675.80] And, you know, looking at, looking at Sony's move, I'm, I'm worried about the console future.
[1676.52 → 1677.26] Oh yeah.
[1677.36 → 1684.48] Microsoft has already telegraphed that they are just utterly disinterested in the hardware side of the business.
[1684.48 → 1687.84] They want to be a, a Netflix for games.
[1688.06 → 1690.16] It's, it's all, it's off.
[1690.36 → 1692.04] I always forget what it's called now.
[1692.12 → 1694.18] Project X cloud, whatever it's actually called.
[1694.30 → 1697.38] What, what, what, what is the Xbox streaming service called?
[1698.24 → 1699.58] Xbox gold or something?
[1699.76 → 1700.96] Any, any, anyway.
[1701.38 → 1702.40] It's all about.
[1706.14 → 1707.38] Xbox cloud gaming?
[1707.48 → 1707.66] Really?
[1708.12 → 1708.42] Yeah.
[1708.48 → 1710.70] It's all, it's all about Xbox game streaming.
[1711.20 → 1712.12] Is that what it's called now?
[1712.34 → 1712.98] It's got something.
[1713.16 → 1715.50] It's all about, it's all about this, their streaming service.
[1715.50 → 1718.26] And it's all about a game pass at this point.
[1718.26 → 1719.20] The website says cloud gaming.
[1719.34 → 1719.52] Sure.
[1719.88 → 1720.90] Xbox cloud gaming.
[1721.26 → 1722.58] So it's all about streaming.
[1722.74 → 1723.84] It's all about game pass.
[1723.84 → 1733.50] It's all about leveraging their data centre expertise to become like a game gaming company, but not necessarily just sell consoles.
[1733.70 → 1733.86] Yeah.
[1734.10 → 1738.34] At, you know, at cost or, or at a loss.
[1738.34 → 1743.54] Um, and seeing how heavily they've promoted the Xbox.
[1743.54 → 1752.12] I mean, in terms of price, like there were, there were holiday deals last year that were very, very aggressive on the series X and the series S.
[1752.12 → 1761.96] Um, and seeing how they've just kind of evidently thrown in the towel on sort of making money on the hardware, and they've invested everything into buying up developers.
[1761.96 → 1781.68] It seems pretty clear to me that Microsoft's interest in the hardware side of things is fading, which I think puts some weight behind what Microsoft said in their defence of Sony's accusations that they were buying up these IPs to make them Xbox exclusive.
[1782.12 → 1808.18] I think I'm at the point now where I kind of believe them that those games will come to PlayStation because they're looking at the cost of developing these mega triple a or a quadruple a game games, the future of gaming and going, look, if we don't target the largest possible installation base, we're taking our own foot and basically turning it into Swiss cheese with a gun.
[1808.36 → 1808.92] Right.
[1809.42 → 1811.72] So I think I kind of buy it now.
[1811.72 → 1812.86] But here's the thing.
[1813.38 → 1821.30] Sony seems to be way faster, way more suddenly, I guess, than I anticipated coming around to the same thing.
[1822.52 → 1840.14] What even, uh, I was talking last week, I think about the console tier list video that we have coming where we were looking at the PS5 going, you know, what are the exclusives that, you know, cement this console as, uh, as, as, you know, iconic, you know, a console for the ages.
[1840.14 → 1847.12] Because that was one of our definitions is like, what were the games that defined or the experiences that defined this console?
[1847.12 → 1863.36] And if all of its best games are going to make their way to PC or, heaven forbid, you know, Xbox or Nintendo Switch 2 or whatever the case may be, it's kind of hard to defend the PlayStation 5 as a piece of hardware that need, that needed to exist at any point.
[1863.36 → 1872.52] And so looking at both Microsoft and Sony headed the Sega route, hopefully not with the same level of disastrousness.
[1872.92 → 1878.84] Um, but heading the Sega route of being more of a more of a software company than an actual hardware company.
[1878.84 → 1886.96] Is it possible or, or even probable that Nintendo is the last one standing?
[1887.22 → 1889.04] Yeah, I think that'll be how it goes.
[1889.36 → 1891.08] I don't know if it'll be soon necessarily.
[1891.24 → 1893.32] I feel like PlayStation is going to hold out for a long time.
[1893.62 → 1897.06] I don't think we're actually that close to PlayStation being done with consoles.
[1897.40 → 1904.34] Although I like almost feel like it might be better for us.
[1904.34 → 1906.82] What if it isn't?
[1906.82 → 1909.30] If they do, if they do stop making consoles, why?
[1909.52 → 1911.60] Oh, well, because.
[1912.26 → 1914.74] You would need some type of host device at home.
[1915.66 → 1916.14] Yeah.
[1917.44 → 1920.16] Better for us if they stop making consoles.
[1920.32 → 1921.00] I don't know.
[1921.14 → 1922.08] I don't know about that.
[1922.10 → 1922.74] As PC people.
[1923.50 → 1934.18] Because it almost feels like some of the most interesting games are the ones where they, like, it's, it's like you've got this positive feedback loop.
[1934.18 → 1936.96] Where you, you make money selling consoles.
[1937.24 → 1938.54] And you dump that into games.
[1938.54 → 1940.68] Then you make money selling the games.
[1940.68 → 1942.36] And then you dump that back into the console.
[1942.60 → 1946.94] And it's like, it's a it's a it's a self-reinforcing.
[1947.28 → 1950.48] It's an ecosystem business model slash.
[1950.48 → 1954.52] Like there's through the, through the hardware, the game and the subscription services.
[1954.70 → 1964.94] It throws a lot of money into a pot that at some point, if they want that, if they want that machine to keep turning, has to go into developing great games.
[1964.94 → 1974.78] And it feels like if they just become software companies, well, they're going to have all the same challenges that the entire rest of the games industry does.
[1974.78 → 1981.06] Where they just need to count on absolutely crushing it with software sales every single time.
[1981.84 → 1986.68] And then funding it unless they want to turn, unless we want every game to just be a game as a service.
[1986.90 → 1992.46] And even those, even those seem really risky these days.
[1992.56 → 1994.04] I have, this is going to sound very off-topic.
[1994.14 → 1994.34] Sure.
[1994.34 → 1999.88] But I, uh, starting next week, we're filming a bunch of things with me for float plane.
[2000.04 → 2003.70] Because apparently we're doing like some content with me.
[2003.78 → 2004.12] I don't know.
[2004.62 → 2006.98] Um, I'm cooking that chicken finally.
[2007.90 → 2012.96] Uh, apparently that'll be probably a very boring video.
[2012.96 → 2015.08] And chicken's not the only animal he's going to be showing you how to cook.
[2015.22 → 2015.62] Wow.
[2016.30 → 2017.42] Oh boy.
[2017.62 → 2019.80] Uh, if people know the context, that's rough.
[2020.74 → 2021.28] It's okay.
[2021.32 → 2022.40] Your mom's probably not watching.
[2022.40 → 2022.82] Yeah.
[2022.98 → 2023.52] I don't know.
[2023.52 → 2026.70] Um, uh, one of them is going to be Starfield review.
[2028.98 → 2030.84] I'm not going to talk about Starfield at all.
[2031.98 → 2038.50] My plan is to entirely talk about the death of like the gaming industry that we grew up with.
[2038.96 → 2043.90] Because like Bethesda is a rotting carcass as of right now.
[2044.62 → 2045.60] Blizzard's like dead.
[2045.86 → 2047.00] Activision's like dead.
[2047.18 → 2048.42] Ubisoft is like dead.
[2048.58 → 2049.60] EA's like dead.
[2049.98 → 2052.16] Like all the biggest names in gaming.
[2052.16 → 2053.80] In fairness, we always kind of hated EA.
[2054.36 → 2054.58] Yeah.
[2054.88 → 2056.50] But they used to release bangers.
[2057.72 → 2059.86] It was annoying because we didn't like the company.
[2059.98 → 2061.14] But like they released good stuff.
[2061.22 → 2062.80] Old school Need for Speed was sick.
[2062.98 → 2063.22] Okay.
[2063.26 → 2063.64] That's fair.
[2064.28 → 2067.04] Old school Need for Speed was like actually an amazing game.
[2067.64 → 2067.90] All right.
[2067.94 → 2068.08] Fair.
[2068.08 → 2070.46] They had other stuff that was perfect.
[2070.46 → 2071.12] I'll allow it.
[2071.12 → 2078.42] Well, um, but yeah, I mean, and then like the yeah, the Atari thing.
[2078.46 → 2079.62] I saw people talking about this online.
[2079.68 → 2085.44] They're like this pattern started with Atari, and we're just seeing the second stage of it.
[2085.44 → 2094.56] Now the first stage was Atari becoming, you know, big and lethargic and failing and the, the good people from it quitting and forming Activision.
[2094.80 → 2098.40] And now Activision is big and lethargic and boring.
[2098.68 → 2100.70] And now people are leaving Activision.
[2100.84 → 2102.02] Studios are leaving Activision.
[2102.14 → 2107.14] Key people are leaving Activision, and they're going off and building things, making their own little companies.
[2107.14 → 2117.52] And we're seeing like the big slam Omega hits over the last little while, uh, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Hell divers 2.
[2117.70 → 2122.18] These, none of these are from the studios you're expecting them to be from, you know?
[2122.28 → 2126.94] Speaking of which, uh, did you get a chance to try out Storm gate from Frost Giant Studios yet?
[2127.26 → 2128.18] No, I haven't played it.
[2128.26 → 2128.46] Okay.
[2128.70 → 2129.02] All right.
[2129.20 → 2130.10] I'm excited to though.
[2131.02 → 2132.12] I didn't pay enough attention.
[2132.22 → 2135.08] I think they did like a play test weekend and I didn't play that weekend.
[2135.08 → 2153.80] Yeah, these are some ex, ex-Blizzard devs, uh, who are making what's supposed to be, what they're trying to turn into kind of spiritual successor to Warcraft 3, Star craft 2, which are IPs that just, uh, Star craft in particular just feels like it's rotting.
[2154.16 → 2154.58] Oh, yeah.
[2154.58 → 2157.08] Like just do anything with that.
[2157.16 → 2159.62] No, no, here's another Diablo dacha game.
[2160.04 → 2163.98] I think pretty much everything Blizzard has is rotting right now, if I'm being completely honest.
[2163.98 → 2165.74] I mean, Diablo seems to be printing money.
[2166.20 → 2166.70] Is it?
[2166.84 → 2167.36] I think so.
[2167.40 → 2167.98] The mobile game.
[2168.34 → 2169.00] Yeah, exactly.
[2169.18 → 2169.86] The desktop game.
[2170.28 → 2170.94] Oh, well, sure.
[2171.06 → 2178.82] Yeah, but I mean, mobile, I mean, when Microsoft completed the acquisition, uh, the fact, okay, here, let, let me back it up.
[2178.82 → 2189.42] The fact that King is even in the name of Activision Blizzard King is just, yeah.
[2190.16 → 2190.84] Like, seriously.
[2190.84 → 2195.30] It's not like those are the only gaming companies that they have either, which is interesting to me.
[2195.30 → 2203.16] No, but the fact that King is like, in the name of the company was mind-blowing to me.
[2203.66 → 2212.36] And then, and then two, the, the revenue share that King has of the entire, of the entire company.
[2212.46 → 2212.82] That's crazy.
[2213.00 → 2215.02] It was just, yeah.
[2215.10 → 2216.12] And when you look at the revenue.
[2216.20 → 2217.26] Utterly mind-destroying to me.
[2217.26 → 2222.94] I think of the revenue of all the like, game series and titles that we, like, care about because we grew up with them.
[2223.34 → 2224.86] They, like, all suck.
[2225.90 → 2226.92] It's like, oh, okay.
[2227.30 → 2229.18] I guess I understand why they're dying.
[2229.30 → 2230.88] But, like, I think there's also a reason.
[2231.32 → 2234.14] David, David told me the latest Final Fantasy is perfect.
[2234.78 → 2239.94] Yeah, this is, so this is in my notes, is that Square Enix is, like, one of the few ones that's held on.
[2240.90 → 2243.44] Like, almost everyone else has totally failed.
[2243.54 → 2246.18] And Square Enix had some dips, but they've recovered every time.
[2246.20 → 2247.10] Yeah, they've done some dumps.
[2247.10 → 2247.46] Dumb stuff.
[2247.76 → 2247.94] Yeah.
[2248.06 → 2249.70] But they've also existed for, like, ever.
[2249.78 → 2250.92] So they're going to do some dumb stuff.
[2251.16 → 2257.98] And pretty much every time that they do, like, with their launch of their MMO, the original launch of the Final Fantasy MMO was terrible.
[2258.74 → 2259.94] But then they were, like, you know what?
[2259.94 → 2261.20] And they really turned that around.
[2261.22 → 2262.26] We're going to make it good.
[2262.34 → 2265.56] And they, like, destroyed the whole first thing that they had.
[2265.56 → 2272.70] If I remember correctly, they, like, cancelled the entire thing, refunded everybody, rebuilt it, came back, and then had this slow, successful burn over time.
[2272.74 → 2273.48] And now it's beloved.
[2273.78 → 2274.44] It's like, okay.
[2274.60 → 2274.86] All right.
[2274.86 → 2282.58] Diablo Immortal has stabilized at anywhere from about $5 to $7 million a month.
[2282.70 → 2283.36] That's ridiculous.
[2283.36 → 2291.44] So Diablo Immortal is generating on a recurring basis somewhere in the neighbourhood of $60 to $70 million a year.
[2291.44 → 2299.30] And that's, like, well into its life cycle here.
[2299.38 → 2300.58] This is from Statista.
[2300.74 → 2304.08] Take these numbers with the grain of salt that they need to be taken with.
[2304.72 → 2307.20] I don't know exactly where these came from.
[2307.20 → 2313.94] But this seems somewhat believable that it did, you know, tens of millions of dollars per month in the first couple of months.
[2313.94 → 2322.04] So this game is so far beyond its ROI point and is now into gravy territory.
[2322.04 → 2330.92] With that said, games as a service don't have quite the traditional, okay, we hit the ROI point.
[2331.10 → 2336.28] Now everything is just gravy that you used to because the development is ongoing.
[2336.48 → 2341.30] But there's no way that the development is costing them $5 to $6 million a month.
[2341.30 → 2344.42] A lot of that is absolutely, absolutely gravy.
[2345.04 → 2355.66] I forget who I was talking to about this, but it is pretty funny to me how clearly NVIDIA seems to see the future
[2355.66 → 2362.86] and how much of their development seems to be going into making your old games fun to play again.
[2362.86 → 2370.16] If you look at the big picture, why does RTX Remix exist?
[2370.96 → 2373.72] It's not like there's any shortage of new games to play.
[2374.08 → 2378.04] So why would anybody need to go back and play Borrowing?
[2378.52 → 2382.68] But like in 8K with ray traced lighting.
[2382.84 → 2384.20] People love nostalgia stuff.
[2384.84 → 2385.68] That's part of it.
[2386.38 → 2388.36] I don't think it's because games are getting worse.
[2388.52 → 2390.30] I actually have a different opinion on this.
[2390.42 → 2391.26] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2391.26 → 2393.62] I'm not saying it's because games are getting worse necessarily.
[2394.22 → 2402.56] What I'm saying is that they are recognizing that the old model of here comes a blockbuster game
[2402.56 → 2407.70] that everyone is going to play, every gamer is going to need,
[2407.70 → 2412.68] or they're just going to get left behind by their gaming crew is dead.
[2412.88 → 2416.10] So they can't count on that to sell GPUs anymore.
[2416.90 → 2419.80] Because like, I think the two things...
[2419.80 → 2426.12] You can't just point at Baldur's Gate 3 and say that that proves the thing or whatever.
[2426.28 → 2427.52] It's one game, Luke.
[2427.54 → 2428.74] The problem now is that I have two.
[2429.18 → 2430.16] Sure, Dark Souls.
[2430.58 → 2430.98] Hell divers.
[2432.70 → 2434.72] Hell divers is killing it.
[2435.08 → 2435.40] Okay.
[2435.96 → 2436.22] Killing.
[2436.22 → 2438.78] Is Hell divers going to sell GPUs?
[2440.96 → 2444.04] Let's have a look at the Hell divers 2 system requirements, shall we?
[2444.04 → 2446.50] Yeah, I don't think those are super high.
[2446.50 → 2449.82] So you need a Core i7 4790K.
[2450.36 → 2451.02] Hey, man.
[2451.10 → 2453.74] And a GTX 1050 Ti.
[2454.26 → 2457.02] I don't think you'll necessarily enjoy your experience with that.
[2457.12 → 2462.46] So my, so my, but my point though, was that Nvidia can't count on these AAA games.
[2462.64 → 2464.10] Pushing Nvidia sales.
[2464.10 → 2469.98] That everyone's going to buy to, to make it so that you have to buy an RTX, you know,
[2470.26 → 2474.66] 69, 69 GT, Ti, whatever.
[2474.88 → 2478.18] Last Epoch and Pal World are not going to help me counter lines.
[2478.18 → 2479.12] They really aren't.
[2479.80 → 2481.14] They are really not.
[2481.48 → 2486.44] So Nvidia is, so Nvidia is investing heavily.
[2486.44 → 2488.20] These are, these are not cheap efforts.
[2488.62 → 2495.84] Nvidia is investing heavily in tools to make your old ugly games kill your current GPU.
[2496.14 → 2496.28] Yeah.
[2496.76 → 2500.68] And not in just like a, like a meaningless, stupid way.
[2501.24 → 2501.58] In a meaningful.
[2501.58 → 2503.90] Some of those shots of Borrowing are actually insane.
[2503.94 → 2506.74] In a meaningful, I would enjoy this game more.
[2506.80 → 2507.10] Oh yeah.
[2507.16 → 2508.14] Playing it this way.
[2508.14 → 2508.46] Oh yeah.
[2508.52 → 2509.14] Kind of way.
[2509.44 → 2510.40] And it's just, I don't know.
[2510.46 → 2514.48] It's, I don't remember how we made it onto this topic of conversation.
[2514.60 → 2514.94] Me neither.
[2514.94 → 2522.30] But it's, it's, it's clear that they've identified that the industry that they grew up in no longer
[2522.30 → 2522.88] exists.
[2523.02 → 2523.22] Yeah.
[2523.24 → 2523.68] Fair enough.
[2524.00 → 2527.20] I just, I think it's, I think it's, yeah, I think it's a life and death cycle.
[2527.40 → 2529.28] I think we're seeing new companies rise up.
[2529.38 → 2531.70] I think we're seeing creative ideas come out.
[2532.28 → 2535.52] Like a lot of people are looking at Hell divers and be like, why isn't this Halo?
[2535.70 → 2536.66] Like, where is Halo?
[2537.58 → 2541.48] Halo Infinite took so long to develop and is trash.
[2541.92 → 2542.54] Like what?
[2542.66 → 2543.62] I like it.
[2543.62 → 2545.02] Sort of.
[2545.54 → 2547.10] Oh, I like things about it.
[2547.38 → 2547.62] Yeah.
[2547.86 → 2551.90] It's the game I play if I'm just like, I'm going to play a game for an hour.
[2552.54 → 2554.48] I've given them zero dollars for it though.
[2554.52 → 2556.00] So I'm definitely part of the problem.
[2558.00 → 2558.86] Wait, no, no.
[2558.92 → 2559.62] I bought the campaign.
[2559.86 → 2561.10] I bought it and then didn't play it.
[2561.34 → 2561.48] Yeah.
[2561.56 → 2562.22] It's not good.
[2562.34 → 2563.34] I guess I contributed.
[2563.56 → 2564.66] I actually like didn't like it.
[2565.04 → 2565.28] Yeah.
[2565.36 → 2566.34] Well, you played it without me.
[2566.34 → 2568.40] I'll still play it with you if you want.
[2569.14 → 2577.58] But yeah, it's like if your girlfriend goes and watches the movie that you were going to
[2577.58 → 2581.04] watch together, and then you're like, yo, WTF.
[2581.04 → 2581.36] Why?
[2581.36 → 2584.14] And they're like, well, I'll watch it again, but it sucked.
[2584.38 → 2585.36] You never have any time.
[2585.36 → 2586.80] I'll watch it again, but it sucked.
[2586.92 → 2587.26] Yeah.
[2587.26 → 2590.66] I'm going to drag you through this experience you didn't even enjoy again.
[2590.78 → 2591.76] I'll happily complain about it.
[2593.02 → 2595.16] Yeah, because that's going to make it more fun for me.
[2595.34 → 2595.78] It might.
[2596.02 → 2597.40] It might be the most fun part.
[2597.52 → 2598.12] What a dick.
[2598.12 → 2601.68] Oh, man.
[2602.40 → 2604.30] But like, I don't know.
[2604.78 → 2609.30] We're looking at this stuff and just kind of like, where are these old companies?
[2609.36 → 2610.68] You're looking at these games that are killing.
[2611.00 → 2613.20] You're looking at the things that the community is asking for.
[2613.46 → 2614.92] They're just not making them.
[2617.26 → 2618.42] And it's frustrating.
[2618.42 → 2625.88] You hear stories about like how people at 343 effectively pitched almost exactly what
[2625.88 → 2626.64] Hell divers is.
[2626.64 → 2630.64] Because like, if you think about it, Halo already has their DST Hell jumpers.
[2631.30 → 2632.84] Like they literally have this thing.
[2632.92 → 2634.28] It exists in their universe.
[2634.52 → 2636.64] You could make a game around it.
[2639.44 → 2640.40] And they just didn't.
[2641.36 → 2642.64] So I don't know.
[2643.78 → 2645.40] Capcom is another company that's been doing good games.
[2645.66 → 2646.52] I agree.
[2647.16 → 2648.56] Isn't Capcom Japanese again?
[2648.96 → 2649.16] Yep.
[2649.62 → 2649.94] Yep.
[2650.04 → 2651.80] So there's a bit of a theme going on there.
[2652.40 → 2655.82] And they also did this thing, though, in my opinion.
[2655.82 → 2657.52] Yeah, Capcom's had some dogs.
[2657.78 → 2658.16] Oh, yeah.
[2658.32 → 2660.92] And they're recently on a rise for sure.
[2661.34 → 2665.74] But they were definitely mostly forgotten about for a little while there.
[2669.26 → 2669.88] All right.
[2670.22 → 2671.18] Dan, what's next?
[2672.26 → 2673.06] What about Valve?
[2673.12 → 2674.36] They like don't make games anymore.
[2674.36 → 2674.58] Yeah.
[2674.70 → 2676.30] What about Valve?
[2676.86 → 2679.62] Hey, we made CS2 and pissed everybody off.
[2680.64 → 2683.28] I mean, did they?
[2683.54 → 2685.24] I mean, what even is CS2?
[2685.68 → 2686.90] Is CS2 a game?
[2688.30 → 2689.18] Define game.
[2689.24 → 2690.58] It's kind of hard to tell at this point.
[2691.18 → 2696.50] I feel like they just like didn't want to maintain Go anymore.
[2696.50 → 2699.22] Like, seriously, define game.
[2700.42 → 2701.68] It's Counter-Strike.
[2702.46 → 2702.78] Sure.
[2702.98 → 2703.72] But the smokes are cool.
[2704.54 → 2704.98] Okay.
[2705.24 → 2706.14] They're pretty cool.
[2707.48 → 2709.24] You can splash splash in the water.
[2709.42 → 2710.14] That's pretty cool.
[2711.82 → 2712.34] Yeah.
[2712.46 → 2713.54] See, people are...
[2713.54 → 2715.30] Know what games is chores.
[2715.66 → 2716.62] Smoke is cool.
[2716.96 → 2717.84] See, this is...
[2717.84 → 2719.24] The smoke is pretty cool.
[2719.36 → 2720.80] Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
[2722.04 → 2723.28] No, I'm doing this.
[2723.40 → 2723.92] I'm actually...
[2723.92 → 2724.58] I'm doing this.
[2724.58 → 2725.20] Okay, here we go.
[2725.32 → 2726.22] Dictionary.com.
[2727.18 → 2728.18] What is your phone doing?
[2728.28 → 2728.60] What's that?
[2728.72 → 2729.08] Charging.
[2729.34 → 2729.50] Oh.
[2732.08 → 2732.48] Yep.
[2732.64 → 2733.44] Why does it have red light?
[2734.04 → 2735.78] Because it has a cool...
[2735.78 → 2739.86] It has a cool multicoloured light that you can have it do different lights for different things.
[2739.86 → 2741.08] That is such an ancient feature.
[2741.26 → 2741.82] Yeah, I know.
[2741.90 → 2742.68] That everyone abandoned.
[2742.94 → 2743.16] Yeah.
[2743.48 → 2743.96] Well, it's cool.
[2744.62 → 2745.68] The Note 9 is...
[2745.68 → 2748.62] It's the phone that has all the things.
[2749.74 → 2750.20] Hold on.
[2750.24 → 2751.04] Actually, let me double-check.
[2751.12 → 2751.98] I think it has that.
[2752.08 → 2754.02] I've never actually tried to configure it.
[2754.58 → 2755.46] Um...
[2755.46 → 2758.28] RGB notification light.
[2758.40 → 2759.30] I think it has one.
[2759.98 → 2761.04] Light colours mean...
[2761.04 → 2763.28] I'd be so happy if they release another Portal game.
[2763.36 → 2764.02] Yeah, it has that.
[2764.28 → 2765.64] Okay, so the definition of a game.
[2766.92 → 2767.20] Noun.
[2768.48 → 2768.90] Wait, what?
[2769.12 → 2771.00] Portal 2 is released in 2011, my dudes.
[2773.18 → 2774.94] Stop reminding me about the passage of time.
[2775.10 → 2777.50] An amusement or pastime.
[2778.48 → 2781.06] So, what does CS2...
[2781.06 → 2785.44] What does CS2 anything that...
[2785.44 → 2788.64] Any way, anything's versus CSGO?
[2788.88 → 2790.08] The smokes are pretty cool.
[2791.20 → 2792.06] Okay, so it's an amusement.
[2792.06 → 2793.32] I can look at the smokes.
[2793.60 → 2794.92] Okay, CS2 is a game.
[2795.00 → 2798.72] I can look at the smoke, and then I can throw a France, and then I can go, oh, it all went away!
[2798.84 → 2799.62] And then it comes back.
[2799.62 → 2803.54] I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't think they developed a game with CS2, because
[2803.54 → 2804.82] the game already existed.
[2805.22 → 2806.34] It's basically like...
[2806.34 → 2808.74] It's basically like if you electronic...
[2808.74 → 2809.38] New buy menu, yeah.
[2809.50 → 2810.82] If you...
[2810.82 → 2811.76] Ah, it's a big one.
[2811.90 → 2812.74] No, they made a market.
[2813.28 → 2814.36] They made a store.
[2815.22 → 2817.56] It's like if you take chess, okay?
[2817.56 → 2822.00] And you create a marketplace for different pieces that you can put on the board.
[2822.14 → 2823.26] Different board styles.
[2823.28 → 2825.90] And you make the board look gorgeous.
[2826.06 → 2826.34] Nice.
[2826.48 → 2826.96] Write this down.
[2827.18 → 2827.62] Write this down.
[2828.16 → 2828.62] You haven't...
[2828.62 → 2829.14] Write this down.
[2830.08 → 2831.62] You haven't made chess.
[2832.54 → 2833.56] Chess is the game.
[2833.72 → 2834.64] You didn't make it.
[2835.50 → 2837.66] You accessorized it.
[2837.66 → 2838.54] You know what would be sick?
[2838.76 → 2839.68] Oh, my goodness.
[2839.68 → 2841.50] Okay, Apple Vision Pro app.
[2841.68 → 2844.86] It's a chess app, but you can play.
[2844.86 → 2848.62] It like puts you at a table at chess events.
[2848.76 → 2849.42] So you can like...
[2849.42 → 2850.18] You can like...
[2850.18 → 2854.92] Magnus Carlsen can be beating somebody up right next to you, and you are playing someone
[2854.92 → 2855.56] at your table.
[2856.02 → 2859.28] And like when Magnus Carlsen does his thing where he's like bored because he's destroying,
[2859.52 → 2862.42] and he just looks at other people's games and evaluates them because he's waiting for
[2862.42 → 2866.72] the other opponent to finally do something, he can like to look at your game, and that could
[2866.72 → 2868.26] be the built-in game evaluation.
[2869.96 → 2870.40] Sick.
[2870.76 → 2874.84] Okay, I really think that that is a much worse idea than what I thought you were going
[2874.84 → 2875.40] with this.
[2876.36 → 2877.66] I thought you were just...
[2877.66 → 2882.80] I thought where you were going was just, you know, developing an exciting...
[2882.80 → 2883.24] Remember...
[2883.24 → 2884.40] Do you remember Battle Chess?
[2884.78 → 2885.56] I actually...
[2885.56 → 2887.38] I look this up every once in a while.
[2887.46 → 2892.18] I want a campaign-based chess game, and they just don't exist, as far as I can tell.
[2892.30 → 2893.58] Battle Chess is sick.
[2894.30 → 2895.26] What is this?
[2895.76 → 2898.26] This is Battle Chess, obviously.
[2898.96 → 2900.48] Oh, my...
[2900.48 → 2900.62] What?
[2901.24 → 2901.80] He picked up...
[2901.80 → 2902.72] Oh, he has no arms.
[2904.84 → 2908.28] It's only a flesh wound, though.
[2908.58 → 2910.28] Yeah, it's the flesh wound meme.
[2910.58 → 2910.88] Yes.
[2911.78 → 2912.26] Oh, no.
[2912.64 → 2913.54] What happens now?
[2914.18 → 2914.42] Oh!
[2915.10 → 2915.50] Okay.
[2915.98 → 2916.62] It's Battle Chess, man.
[2916.62 → 2917.22] What is that?
[2917.54 → 2918.34] Don't worry about it.
[2918.34 → 2918.96] It's Battle Chess.
[2919.24 → 2919.72] It's a rook.
[2919.72 → 2924.34] What?
[2928.88 → 2930.06] Wow, that's amazing.
[2930.20 → 2930.78] Oh, my.
[2931.58 → 2932.18] Bishop, man.
[2932.26 → 2933.70] They got god powers.
[2934.52 → 2934.94] Anyway...
[2934.94 → 2935.60] Are those queens?
[2936.36 → 2936.84] Yes.
[2937.52 → 2937.88] Wow.
[2938.58 → 2940.16] You can tell from the...
[2940.16 → 2940.88] Yep.
[2942.12 → 2943.18] Queenly...
[2943.18 → 2943.46] Yeah.
[2945.16 → 2946.46] Oh, the rooks are epic.
[2947.16 → 2948.64] Yeah, they're rock monsters.
[2948.64 → 2954.08] But, yeah, I would love to have, like, a...
[2954.08 → 2954.68] Wait, people...
[2954.68 → 2955.76] FPS Chess?
[2955.90 → 2956.28] What?
[2956.86 → 2957.62] Is this a thing?
[2958.58 → 2959.78] What's FPS Chess?
[2960.12 → 2966.66] Anyway, what I was going to say was, basically, you create, like, a chess with, you know, microtransactions,
[2966.80 → 2967.12] essentially.
[2967.28 → 2968.50] So, you can buy, like, skins.
[2968.50 → 2968.72] Yeah.
[2968.86 → 2969.70] Skins for your chess.
[2970.24 → 2970.86] FPS Chess.
[2970.86 → 2972.00] Wait, what the heck?
[2972.06 → 2972.86] This is amazing.
[2972.88 → 2973.48] Oh, my God.
[2973.50 → 2974.52] Of course this is a thing.
[2975.66 → 2976.44] Here we go.
[2976.44 → 2977.64] What?
[2977.70 → 2978.72] You can fly and stuff?
[2978.78 → 2979.12] Hold on.
[2979.16 → 2979.46] Hold on.
[2979.50 → 2979.82] Here we go.
[2979.88 → 2980.26] Here we go.
[2980.32 → 2980.82] What is this?
[2981.46 → 2981.82] What am I...
[2981.82 → 2982.18] What am I...
[2982.18 → 2982.96] What am I looking at?
[2982.98 → 2983.38] Just wait for it.
[2983.40 → 2984.04] Just wait for it.
[2984.32 → 2984.96] Just wait for it.
[2988.72 → 2989.04] Headshot.
[2989.14 → 2989.58] Headshot.
[2990.50 → 2991.20] And then wait.
[2991.96 → 2992.54] Rocket jump.
[2992.66 → 2993.36] And then they're flying.
[2993.88 → 2994.18] What?
[2995.24 → 2996.34] What's happening right now?
[2996.34 → 2996.90] So then...
[2996.90 → 2997.40] Queen wins.
[2997.40 → 3000.80] So when you fight for a space...
[3000.80 → 3001.76] King wins.
[3001.94 → 3002.18] Ooh.
[3002.58 → 3005.24] You can not win, necessarily?
[3005.66 → 3006.02] Maybe.
[3006.12 → 3006.70] I have no idea.
[3007.36 → 3008.26] I don't want this.
[3008.30 → 3009.26] I just want a campaign.
[3010.38 → 3011.66] Is that a suppressed sniper?
[3012.02 → 3012.28] Wow.
[3013.76 → 3014.38] Rook wins.
[3014.40 → 3014.94] A little over the top.
[3014.96 → 3015.26] Okay.
[3015.90 → 3017.86] Well, that's something that exists.
[3020.04 → 3020.64] Uh...
[3020.64 → 3021.48] Cool.
[3021.48 → 3022.48] Thanks.
[3023.92 → 3025.36] Very positive reviews.
[3025.54 → 3027.38] It came out in July 2022.
[3028.00 → 3028.44] I don't want...
[3028.44 → 3028.86] I don't want...
[3028.86 → 3031.98] I don't want 5D chess with multiverses and time travel.
[3032.08 → 3032.34] That's...
[3032.34 → 3032.92] That's cool.
[3033.14 → 3033.72] That's neat.
[3034.12 → 3034.86] That's interesting.
[3035.02 → 3035.96] I just want a campaign.
[3036.28 → 3037.22] Chess MMO.
[3039.40 → 3041.48] I think that's just chess.com.
[3042.52 → 3044.18] I think that's legitimately chess.com.
[3044.18 → 3045.12] Google en passant.
[3046.12 → 3047.46] I know what en passant is.
[3048.42 → 3050.76] Anyway, we're supposed to do some merch messages.
[3050.76 → 3051.44] Hey!
[3051.70 → 3052.56] Guess what?
[3053.04 → 3054.88] We've been talking about this forever.
[3055.90 → 3056.42] The hat?
[3057.16 → 3058.12] The hat.
[3058.32 → 3058.58] The hat's the.
[3058.74 → 3059.10] Okay.
[3059.34 → 3059.60] Okay.
[3059.76 → 3062.58] So, remember when we did a poll on WAN Show?
[3062.94 → 3065.12] And we asked the people...
[3065.12 → 3065.42] Hold on.
[3065.46 → 3066.34] Let me just...
[3066.34 → 3067.20] It's not...
[3067.20 → 3071.00] It's not obvious outwardly which one is which.
[3071.08 → 3071.82] Can you tell from the bands?
[3072.30 → 3073.32] You know what?
[3073.48 → 3073.68] Nope.
[3073.92 → 3074.08] No.
[3074.18 → 3075.14] These might...
[3075.14 → 3075.50] Wait.
[3075.56 → 3077.32] Did they seriously...
[3077.32 → 3078.44] Oh, they only...
[3078.44 → 3079.30] Okay.
[3079.30 → 3081.08] These are the same hat.
[3081.64 → 3081.98] Wow.
[3081.98 → 3082.54] One is large.
[3082.90 → 3083.58] One is medium.
[3083.82 → 3083.96] Wow.
[3084.24 → 3084.44] Okay.
[3084.50 → 3090.92] The point is, ages ago, we asked you guys, hey, do you just want like a more comfortable,
[3091.74 → 3093.20] you know, us designed?
[3093.40 → 3094.40] There's no Smarty.
[3094.40 → 3096.38] So, it's like super comfy.
[3096.52 → 3098.44] It has a nice size adjuster.
[3098.54 → 3099.32] Oh, no Smarty.
[3099.70 → 3099.90] Yeah.
[3100.08 → 3101.04] No Smarty.
[3101.20 → 3101.48] Nice.
[3101.48 → 3105.58] It has quite a nice size adjuster, and it's, you know, just the right depth.
[3105.72 → 3106.66] It's a quality hat.
[3107.00 → 3109.32] Do you just want like a quality, you know, basic hat?
[3109.38 → 3111.34] We're bringing back, you know, the basic hat.
[3111.34 → 3117.76] Or do you want an expensive hat that's like waterproof and made out of this super expensive material?
[3118.00 → 3120.40] And you guys basically voted 50-50.
[3120.62 → 3123.76] So, we were like, all right, thanks for nothing.
[3123.78 → 3124.82] That's not very useful.
[3125.58 → 3126.72] And we made both.
[3128.94 → 3129.90] DA-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[3130.22 → 3131.06] The LTT hat.
[3131.94 → 3133.56] And the LTT hat pro.
[3134.26 → 3136.86] Now, I saw some really cool video.
[3137.56 → 3140.56] When it was in thumbnail mode, I was going to say like, who is that?
[3141.02 → 3141.38] It's you.
[3144.18 → 3144.74] Wow.
[3144.96 → 3147.64] These guys were having way too much fun.
[3147.76 → 3148.38] Colton rocking.
[3149.02 → 3151.88] So, you can see the water beading on there.
[3152.48 → 3154.58] So, we've got two versions of the hat.
[3154.68 → 3156.26] We've got the regular hat.
[3156.26 → 3161.34] And we've got the LTT hat pro made exclusively for professional grass touches.
[3161.62 → 3163.62] It's water-resistant for everyday use.
[3163.70 → 3164.46] Okay, what's the fabric?
[3164.82 → 3165.64] There it is.
[3167.08 → 3170.78] Gentile cotton with incredible water repellence.
[3171.40 → 3173.16] Repellence, excuse me, by design.
[3173.26 → 3175.10] Got a bunch of information here.
[3175.58 → 3176.48] Really nice comfort.
[3176.58 → 3178.46] No matter how you wear it, forward, backward.
[3179.04 → 3184.18] One of my requirements was that it should still be comfortable even if you wear it sideways like a complete f***ING tool.
[3184.30 → 3184.56] Okay.
[3185.04 → 3185.44] Look.
[3185.44 → 3186.14] You know what?
[3186.26 → 3188.92] It matters to me.
[3189.26 → 3189.52] Okay?
[3189.62 → 3190.54] It matters to me.
[3190.80 → 3191.80] That works surprisingly well.
[3191.80 → 3194.12] I just, I didn't want the...
[3194.12 → 3195.24] Wait, I can...
[3195.24 → 3195.78] Yeah.
[3195.94 → 3196.16] Okay.
[3196.60 → 3198.30] Please, please stop.
[3198.80 → 3200.22] Sick beats there, Luke.
[3200.22 → 3201.02] It totally works.
[3201.16 → 3202.16] Please actually stop.
[3202.16 → 3204.38] Everything that we're looking at right now is not okay.
[3204.80 → 3207.34] I got a question asking if it comes in tall.
[3207.96 → 3208.30] Tall?
[3208.60 → 3208.80] No.
[3209.70 → 3210.42] Medium and large.
[3210.60 → 3210.84] Sorry.
[3211.28 → 3211.98] Medium and large.
[3211.98 → 3212.52] Um...
[3212.52 → 3217.86] But the main feature is just that it's comfortable.
[3218.42 → 3219.46] Anyway, it's there.
[3219.58 → 3220.18] It's on the store.
[3220.28 → 3222.12] And you can pick it up this week.
[3222.18 → 3224.26] And while you're at it, you can leave a merch message.
[3224.26 → 3230.20] The way to interact with the show is not through super chats or whatever they're called.
[3230.32 → 3231.40] Whatever the thing's on Twitch.
[3231.40 → 3231.84] Twitch bits?
[3231.94 → 3233.36] Twitch bits or anything like that.
[3233.38 → 3233.46] I don't know.
[3233.46 → 3233.82] It might be it.
[3234.10 → 3235.46] It's merch messages.
[3235.76 → 3239.32] Because instead of just throwing money at your screen, you should throw money at your
[3239.32 → 3242.50] screen and get quality merchandise in return.
[3242.64 → 3244.74] And by the way, we will also take your messages.
[3244.90 → 3248.98] They'll go to producer Dan, who will sort through them and either pop them up on the screen
[3248.98 → 3252.20] like Anonymous is here who just scored a Noctua Edition screwdriver.
[3252.88 → 3258.70] Or we'll forward them internally to get you guys an answer, reply to you, or even curate
[3258.70 → 3260.88] them for me and Luke to address.
[3261.14 → 3263.60] And these days, often Dan as well.
[3264.92 → 3269.82] All you have to do is put something in your cart and there'll be a little box anytime we're
[3269.82 → 3272.42] live that will allow you to leave a merch message.
[3272.50 → 3274.36] So we're going to show you guys kinda how that works.
[3274.90 → 3275.72] And oh right!
[3275.88 → 3277.92] There's another promo for the store.
[3277.92 → 3288.20] I didn't see it on the homepage, but we are, yes, we have a promo running on the retro
[3288.20 → 3289.14] screwdriver.
[3289.90 → 3296.68] All you have to do is add the retro edition, okay, so retro colourway to your order and you
[3296.68 → 3300.08] will get free shipping for your entire order!
[3300.76 → 3301.74] Oh, nice.
[3301.96 → 3304.66] Yeah, Nick was like, hey, we should do a promo.
[3304.66 → 3311.80] It's March, which is a pretty traditionally slow time for retail.
[3311.94 → 3312.28] Ah!
[3312.58 → 3315.32] And I was like, hmm.
[3315.32 → 3318.18] And then we did it.
[3319.28 → 3320.16] So there it is.
[3320.20 → 3321.22] Order a retro screwdriver.
[3321.62 → 3324.10] Get free shipping on your whole order.
[3324.32 → 3324.92] Let's go.
[3325.72 → 3326.08] All right.
[3326.18 → 3328.16] Dan, do you want to show us how merch messages work?
[3328.24 → 3330.06] I will say one quick thing before we go on.
[3331.18 → 3333.40] It's actually a lot nicer with headphones.
[3333.94 → 3335.98] Because of the no already bean thing.
[3336.06 → 3336.32] I know.
[3336.66 → 3336.88] Yeah.
[3337.66 → 3338.82] There's no pressure point.
[3339.30 → 3342.38] Like everything else we do, this hat took an embarrassing amount of time.
[3342.42 → 3344.26] Have you noticed how long we've had no hats on the store?
[3344.74 → 3345.10] Oh, yeah.
[3345.32 → 3348.36] That's because we were working on development of the hat, and we were like, well, let's not
[3348.36 → 3351.32] reorder any more of these other hats because we're going to make a better hat.
[3351.42 → 3352.10] Let's do it eventually, yeah.
[3352.30 → 3352.52] Yeah.
[3352.52 → 3357.42] So we're both wearing the regular cotton one and then the gentile one is like double
[3357.42 → 3362.30] the price or whatever because that material is like wildly expensive.
[3362.68 → 3362.90] Yeah.
[3363.00 → 3369.50] It's 20 bucks, and it's 40 bucks, and it's just a really comfortable hat, or it's a really
[3369.50 → 3371.00] comfortable hat with water resistance.
[3371.00 → 3371.58] It's up to you.
[3371.86 → 3375.26] One thing to note is that the little like holes are not on the pro.
[3375.36 → 3376.90] That's the only cosmetic difference.
[3376.98 → 3380.02] That's why I was so confused when I was looking at them because I thought I had one of each.
[3380.30 → 3381.10] Oh, that makes sense.
[3381.10 → 3388.84] I'm just translating myself to think that the one with the waterproof fabric had a hole
[3388.84 → 3389.20] on it.
[3389.34 → 3389.54] Sorry.
[3389.62 → 3391.32] I want to be really careful with the word waterproof.
[3391.98 → 3392.34] Okay.
[3392.50 → 3394.88] I don't use the word waterproof.
[3395.32 → 3400.58] From my understanding, this is a waterproof material, but it's a word I just like to avoid
[3400.58 → 3404.18] because water will literally cut a path through a mountain.
[3404.64 → 3409.54] So nothing is waterproof, but the water, what's the point of having a water-resistant one with
[3409.54 → 3409.96] a hole in it?
[3410.00 → 3410.80] So I was really confused.
[3410.80 → 3411.98] Firefighters don't like fireproof.
[3412.66 → 3412.92] Yeah.
[3413.20 → 3413.42] Yeah.
[3413.58 → 3414.52] Because it's like, really?
[3414.70 → 3415.56] How much fire?
[3415.74 → 3416.28] How long?
[3416.32 → 3416.82] How hot?
[3417.06 → 3417.34] Yeah.
[3417.66 → 3417.96] Yeah.
[3417.96 → 3421.64] We can melt basically anything.
[3421.64 → 3424.12] So like, come at me, bro.
[3424.22 → 3424.58] Yeah.
[3424.58 → 3424.98] Yeah.
[3424.98 → 3429.64] So that's why, that's why we had that whole thing with Messi where we changed our talking
[3429.64 → 3430.64] points to Messi.
[3430.86 → 3433.80] Messi says they're waterproof instead of us saying they're waterproof.
[3433.80 → 3435.30] Because I won't say anything is waterproof.
[3435.30 → 3436.86] In fairness to Messi.
[3436.86 → 3437.54] They're good.
[3437.90 → 3438.66] Good shoes.
[3438.74 → 3441.80] I like them, but nothing is waterproof.
[3442.06 → 3442.60] All right.
[3442.62 → 3442.90] Anyway.
[3443.82 → 3444.68] Uh, Dan.
[3444.86 → 3445.04] Yeah.
[3445.08 → 3445.30] Sure.
[3445.76 → 3446.12] Sup.
[3446.42 → 3448.40] Little large and dad.
[3448.40 → 3453.02] So, you know, this white circle, easy peel tabs on food and stuff.
[3453.36 → 3457.50] Why the actual F do those always rip and make peeling it?
[3457.56 → 3458.38] Not easy at all.
[3458.50 → 3459.40] You make products.
[3459.54 → 3460.66] How could this happen?
[3461.12 → 3463.14] I don't think I've ever ripped one of those.
[3463.26 → 3463.52] Oh yeah.
[3463.56 → 3464.02] Some of them.
[3464.20 → 3465.18] Sometimes like apples.
[3465.56 → 3466.26] Apple sticker ones.
[3466.40 → 3466.60] Yeah.
[3466.70 → 3468.82] Sometimes they're made of paper if you get them wet.
[3469.48 → 3474.26] So I've made the mistake of washing an apple before peeling it.
[3474.26 → 3480.76] And what happens is the paper layer, um, delaminates from the adhesive layer and then
[3480.76 → 3485.88] getting that adhesive layer off completely without pulling out the isopropyl alcohol and
[3485.88 → 3487.64] like cleaning your apple.
[3488.96 → 3489.48] Really?
[3489.48 → 3496.36] Uh, whereas the plastic ones come off, even if you get them wet first, but from my understanding
[3496.36 → 3498.66] are more environmentally impactful.
[3499.06 → 3502.06] So hopefully that answers the question.
[3502.06 → 3511.28] But, um, the one that really drives me crazy is, um, the, the ocean spray raisins, the dried
[3511.28 → 3514.30] cranberries, the pack that they have at Costco.
[3514.30 → 3522.40] Maybe I'm about to reveal that I'm a complete idiot, but as far as I can tell, there's been
[3522.40 → 3530.74] an error in the packaging such that if you use the like pull thing, the resealable mechanism
[3530.74 → 3532.18] for it doesn't work.
[3532.18 → 3534.44] Is it the raisins?
[3534.64 → 3535.50] I don't, I don't know.
[3535.58 → 3542.12] There's, there's one very like large brand, like large recognizable brand thing that they
[3542.12 → 3548.78] carry at Costco where if you use the pull tab, it, uh, the, the, the reseal thing doesn't
[3548.78 → 3553.52] work, and you have to get out a knife, and you have to like to cut it yourself in your own spot
[3553.52 → 3555.60] instead of where the little indent is.
[3555.66 → 3558.50] And I think it's the raisins, but some people are agreeing with you.
[3558.56 → 3559.42] So yeah, I think you're right.
[3559.50 → 3559.92] It might be.
[3560.04 → 3560.36] Yeah.
[3560.46 → 3561.42] Is it, is it raisins?
[3562.82 → 3564.34] Uh, people are saying yes.
[3564.52 → 3567.18] They had the line cut underneath the resealable zipper.
[3567.26 → 3567.42] Yeah.
[3567.58 → 3567.96] Thanks.
[3568.10 → 3568.40] Okay.
[3568.42 → 3568.64] Yeah.
[3569.38 → 3573.72] That has been like that for, I kid you not like five years.
[3574.86 → 3580.64] And it's, it's such a it's such a simple, it's such a the fact that nobody at ocean
[3580.64 → 3590.34] spray ever bought a pack of their raisins and was like, this is stupid is mind-blowing
[3590.34 → 3590.96] to me.
[3591.10 → 3593.16] It is absolutely mind-blowing to me.
[3593.20 → 3597.96] I mean, I've talked about this on the show where I think that the president of every car
[3597.96 → 3601.20] company should have to drive only cars that they make.
[3601.46 → 3603.46] They should, they should rotate through them.
[3603.70 → 3609.60] They should have to drive every single car they make because how else are you going to
[3609.60 → 3610.28] get anything done?
[3610.28 → 3613.58] Like the number of, if they think it isn't safe enough, they shouldn't make it.
[3614.16 → 3619.60] And I mean, not just that, like if, if they come across something that is annoying and in
[3619.60 → 3625.76] so many cases costs nothing to fix, literally actually nothing, you know, to move a button
[3625.76 → 3629.92] where you can reach it more easily or to whatever it is, right?
[3629.92 → 3640.22] The fact that they don't act as their own harshest reviewers just grinds my gears so hard.
[3641.30 → 3646.54] You know, you talk of men and anything is like this, you know, like if you are, if you,
[3646.54 → 3653.70] if you run, you know, public transit for the city of Vancouver, if you don't ride it at
[3653.70 → 3661.86] the least once a month, you, how could you possibly, how could you possibly even hope to make decisions
[3661.86 → 3664.56] that impact the people who do ride it?
[3664.56 → 3665.56] Yeah.
[3665.56 → 3666.48] Yeah.
[3666.48 → 3670.88] Ideally, if it's only going to be once a month, you should ride it like a lot that one day.
[3671.62 → 3673.26] You shouldn't like to get on one bus.
[3673.82 → 3676.00] They should probably vary locations and stuff.
[3676.64 → 3677.08] Anyway.
[3677.08 → 3679.96] Like I use float plane every day.
[3680.26 → 3680.50] Yeah.
[3680.72 → 3681.42] I use it.
[3682.06 → 3688.28] I mean, I had a, I had a meeting with Dennis earlier this week when we were talking about
[3688.28 → 3691.42] his, his like creative, creative sponsor spots.
[3692.00 → 3697.60] And he asked me about the ones that we did for wicked cushions at CES.
[3697.76 → 3703.14] And I was like, brother, do you think I watched sponsor spots?
[3703.14 → 3708.14] Whenever I watched like Adam's video or any of the other hosts videos, I've watched them
[3708.14 → 3708.76] on float plane.
[3708.88 → 3709.04] Yeah.
[3709.20 → 3711.26] The fuck you think this is going to watch on YouTube?
[3711.26 → 3713.10] Like some kind of pleb?
[3713.22 → 3716.30] Like, no, watch without the sponsor spots on float plane.
[3716.86 → 3718.34] And he's like, Oh, that makes sense.
[3720.22 → 3721.46] I'm getting called out.
[3721.54 → 3724.94] I, because I mentioned, I don't watch all the LCT videos and I said, I watch every day.
[3725.06 → 3726.52] There's more stuff on there than LCT.
[3726.78 → 3727.00] Yeah.
[3727.60 → 3727.76] Yeah.
[3727.76 → 3728.48] We're not the only ones.
[3728.68 → 3729.04] Just saying.
[3729.46 → 3729.64] Yeah.
[3729.70 → 3730.02] Just saying.
[3730.36 → 3731.64] I also do watch LCT videos.
[3731.72 → 3732.88] I just don't watch all of them.
[3732.88 → 3734.76] But you guys release a lot of stuff.
[3734.88 → 3735.20] Sorry.
[3736.92 → 3738.02] So much content.
[3738.08 → 3739.32] Man, we've got some good stuff coming.
[3739.32 → 3744.98] Hey, speaking of NVIDIA, who we roasted in the first topic of the show, guess who's
[3744.98 → 3745.42] back?
[3745.84 → 3746.70] Back again.
[3747.14 → 3747.58] No way.
[3748.00 → 3750.08] NVIDIA sponsored a video.
[3750.62 → 3751.36] I know, right?
[3751.58 → 3751.94] What?
[3752.18 → 3753.62] It's been, hold on.
[3753.76 → 3760.00] I think the last, I think the last time they worked with us in a non-editorial capacity,
[3760.00 → 3766.92] and even that seemed begrudging for quite a while, was the launch of the RTX 3090.
[3767.32 → 3771.86] So that was September 2020.
[3772.86 → 3775.14] Three and a half years ago.
[3775.14 → 3783.82] So in that time, in that time, from my understanding, some people have moved on.
[3783.92 → 3784.18] Yeah.
[3784.30 → 3785.00] At NVIDIA.
[3785.18 → 3785.36] Yeah.
[3785.52 → 3787.88] Oh, no, I think that's not even, that's just true.
[3788.00 → 3791.10] Well, it's more than just one person whose butt I hurt.
[3791.26 → 3791.56] Okay.
[3791.56 → 3793.14] I mean, that's not surprising.
[3793.14 → 3798.88] Some people have, some people have moved on or are in positions of lesser importance.
[3799.74 → 3805.48] And I wouldn't be surprised if that controversy contributed.
[3805.96 → 3811.28] Anyway, the point is, there's, there's, there's a new sheriff in town when it comes to media
[3811.28 → 3811.80] engagement.
[3811.80 → 3817.54] And we actually first, I first sat down with them in June of last year.
[3817.70 → 3820.06] And they were basically like, no, no, we're different now.
[3820.14 → 3820.76] We're different now.
[3820.80 → 3821.78] And I was like, sure.
[3822.26 → 3827.08] And they were like, no, but like, you know, we really want to, we really want to work with
[3827.08 → 3827.54] the media.
[3827.86 → 3829.24] We want to work with you guys.
[3829.36 → 3832.54] We want to, we want to be good citizens.
[3832.80 → 3834.02] And I was like, sure.
[3834.56 → 3838.88] And I basically, I always feel bad when this happens because it's not, it's not his fault.
[3838.88 → 3842.54] But I basically tore a strip out of him.
[3842.60 → 3845.42] I was like, look, this is everything that NVIDIA has done wrong.
[3846.54 → 3846.94] Ever.
[3849.58 → 3850.80] How long was this called?
[3850.98 → 3852.02] Like, I'm not even trying to.
[3852.02 → 3852.36] No, this was in person.
[3852.72 → 3852.92] Oh.
[3852.94 → 3853.60] This is at Computer.
[3853.90 → 3854.24] Oh.
[3854.48 → 3859.14] So I sat down with, I mean, I don't, I don't know.
[3859.28 → 3863.32] I don't know if one of these people is like publicly everyone knows what they do.
[3863.58 → 3864.90] But Jacob was one of them.
[3864.94 → 3866.40] You remember Jacob from VGA, right?
[3866.40 → 3866.48] Of course.
[3866.70 → 3867.68] So Jacob was there.
[3867.68 → 3869.16] We had someone from.
[3869.16 → 3871.48] I truly believe he would try to do good things.
[3871.56 → 3872.26] Oh, Jacob's great.
[3872.28 → 3872.78] He's awesome.
[3872.88 → 3873.04] Yeah.
[3873.20 → 3875.02] But anyway, so we had, so Jacob was there.
[3875.16 → 3877.26] The other guy who's handing media relations now.
[3877.30 → 3878.98] And I don't know if his name is public.
[3879.10 → 3881.36] I don't want to like out somebody, but Jacob's a public figure.
[3881.44 → 3882.08] So I don't, whatever.
[3882.52 → 3883.00] Jacob's fine.
[3883.10 → 3884.12] So, so Jacob was there.
[3884.20 → 3885.50] Someone from our business team was there.
[3885.60 → 3886.26] I was there.
[3886.26 → 3889.60] And then the, the media relations guy from NVIDIA was there.
[3889.60 → 3895.42] And like Jacob had just made the transition from VGA to NVIDIA.
[3895.58 → 3901.72] And so I, I, I'm not going to put any words in his mouth because he didn't say much.
[3901.72 → 3913.02] Um, but it was, it, it definitely was an interesting dynamic having me from the media side, Jacob from very recently, the NVIDIA partner side.
[3913.02 → 3919.02] And then the other guy from the I'm sure you brought up things they've done to their partners, not just media.
[3919.22 → 3931.00] So I basically laid out everything from NVIDIA that I've seen over the course of my career that has, that has illustrated that there's a significant attitude problem.
[3931.16 → 3937.16] Not just these isolated instances of, of bad behaviour.
[3937.40 → 3940.80] Um, and he was like, okay, I'm going to take all that.
[3940.80 → 3945.28] And, uh, you know, I'm gonna work with it, and I'm, I'm going to get back to you.
[3945.32 → 3948.16] And anyway, we, we connected briefly again at CES.
[3948.26 → 3950.58] So this is a six months later and three months ago.
[3951.06 → 3953.70] And he was like, yeah, you know, we really want to work with you guys.
[3953.70 → 3960.96] And you know what, in fairness, everything I've heard from Gary from the lab has been that NVIDIA has been taking feedback, like, like actually like really seriously.
[3961.62 → 3967.72] Um, you know, anytime we're, we're finding any, any odd behaviour with the product or, or bugs or whatever else.
[3967.72 → 3970.12] Um, they, they seem to, the GeForce team.
[3970.80 → 3978.66] Even though I, I, I, I've talked about, uh, actually, well, these, these things actually kind of go together, but the GeForce team seems to still care a lot about gaming.
[3978.98 → 3983.24] Even if NVIDIA as a company has largely moved on to AI.
[3983.24 → 3990.22] Um, and I, I talked about how I, I would actually be really interested to see NVIDIA just split off GeForce.
[3990.22 → 3990.66] Yeah.
[3990.98 → 3998.22] As a, as a separate entity that can just be scrappy and not have to have the same kinds of margins or else they're stock tanks or whatever else.
[3998.22 → 4003.32] And just focus on gaming because those guys are passionate.
[4003.80 → 4004.06] Oh yeah.
[4004.12 → 4004.68] They're passionate.
[4004.90 → 4005.08] Yeah.
[4005.08 → 4014.14] So anyway, we are, um, we are working with NVIDIA on a sponsored video that is going to be upgrading our worst setups.
[4015.26 → 4016.76] Our, our worst setup.
[4016.76 → 4023.84] So we had people at the company submit their personal rig setups or work PC setups.
[4024.00 → 4027.64] There are some, you're going to see some stuff.
[4028.50 → 4029.50] Personal setups.
[4029.66 → 4030.06] Oh no.
[4030.06 → 4034.98] Um, not everybody owns a vacuum.
[4036.46 → 4036.94] Apparently.
[4037.20 → 4037.54] No.
[4039.18 → 4044.78] I don't know that for sure, but what I will say is I didn't see one, and I didn't see evidence of one existing.
[4045.72 → 4047.02] I feel like this should be two videos.
[4047.60 → 4048.12] Anywho.
[4048.22 → 4048.42] Anywho.
[4048.42 → 4050.56] Or we should just be reacting and judging to the systems.
[4050.72 → 4053.58] The point is I was on my way to that shoot.
[4053.58 → 4062.54] I forget how I got onto this topic, and I was talking to Dennis about the creative reads and I hadn't seen, uh, anything that was on YouTube because I watch float plane.
[4063.64 → 4065.46] Uh, uh, one quick thing.
[4065.58 → 4069.26] The, uh, LTT pro hat in the pictures has holes.
[4070.18 → 4070.96] Oh, okay.
[4070.96 → 4072.06] Or it has the circles.
[4072.24 → 4077.12] I don't know if it actually passes through, but I'm seeing on, on multiple people.
[4077.56 → 4078.28] Maybe it does.
[4078.36 → 4079.46] Maybe it just does have holes then.
[4079.76 → 4080.42] Maybe that's a thing.
[4082.30 → 4083.04] Either way.
[4083.04 → 4086.72] There might be a layer of something under it because those might be structural.
[4087.30 → 4089.78] It is definitely made of the water-resistant material.
[4090.06 → 4091.06] So make of that what you will.
[4091.48 → 4091.58] Yeah.
[4091.68 → 4093.16] Here, I'm just going to look at, uh, Colton.
[4093.22 → 4093.96] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4094.02 → 4094.78] It has the hole still.
[4095.10 → 4095.32] Okay.
[4095.42 → 4095.80] There you go.
[4096.26 → 4097.68] I can actually even see through it.
[4098.16 → 4099.26] I wonder why it has holes.
[4101.56 → 4101.88] Yeah.
[4101.92 → 4103.40] I can definitely see through this one.
[4103.52 → 4103.64] Yep.
[4103.72 → 4104.04] All right.
[4104.56 → 4107.60] It definitely has holes, but it is made of the water-resistant material.
[4108.42 → 4108.98] All right.
[4109.18 → 4112.48] Uh, where was, yeah, where was I going with the story about, uh, oh yeah.
[4112.48 → 4114.14] Anyway, well, Nvidia, Nvidia is back.
[4114.40 → 4119.78] So we are, they, they are sponsoring a video upgrading our worst setup and yeah, you guys
[4119.78 → 4120.70] are going to see some stuff.
[4121.16 → 4131.24] Uh, I, I, uh, you know, I, the person who I'm talking about will know who they are.
[4131.24 → 4131.78] Oh no.
[4131.90 → 4134.48] And, um, are, is going to watch this.
[4134.54 → 4135.74] I know that for a fact.
[4136.06 → 4146.96] So, you know, I, uh, I didn't want to touch anything when I was there.
[4148.16 → 4149.78] Is going to watch this.
[4149.88 → 4150.00] Yeah.
[4150.04 → 4151.48] They're definitely going to watch this.
[4151.60 → 4152.46] I think I know who it is.
[4152.46 → 4154.24] Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't say anything though.
[4154.24 → 4159.12] Cause the video is going to start with us meeting all the finalists, and then it'll,
[4159.24 → 4160.04] it'll go from there.
[4160.12 → 4160.52] Wow.
[4160.66 → 4168.68] And, uh, and, and all I know so far is that I have been to all the finalists setups.
[4168.92 → 4169.88] I have seen all the setups.
[4170.42 → 4174.76] Um, but we're going to do, we're going to film, um, probably on Tuesday.
[4174.76 → 4180.56] We're going to film announcing to them who is going to be getting, uh, the setup upgrade.
[4180.56 → 4183.54] And then we're going to do some stuff.
[4184.82 → 4185.28] Anywho.
[4187.00 → 4188.14] Elijah LMAO.
[4188.22 → 4189.16] Everyone's saying it's me.
[4189.30 → 4189.98] It's not.
[4190.04 → 4190.50] I promise.
[4190.78 → 4192.40] Uh, I will say this much.
[4192.44 → 4194.58] It is not Elijah there.
[4194.78 → 4195.52] It's not Elijah.
[4196.76 → 4197.76] Another March message.
[4198.08 → 4198.44] Yeah.
[4198.52 → 4198.80] Hit me.
[4199.16 → 4200.92] I don't even remember what that question was.
[4201.60 → 4202.38] Stickers bed.
[4204.38 → 4204.82] Basically.
[4205.34 → 4205.74] Okay.
[4206.00 → 4206.42] Oh yeah.
[4206.42 → 4207.18] Oh, right.
[4208.06 → 4208.50] Wow.
[4208.66 → 4209.02] Whoa.
[4209.02 → 4212.16] I either have a gift or a problem.
[4212.80 → 4215.10] I just, I'm enabling you to be perfectly honest.
[4215.12 → 4215.82] It can be both.
[4216.08 → 4216.94] It's okay to be both.
[4216.94 → 4217.34] You can have both.
[4218.20 → 4222.92] Many businesses in the tech sector seem to be aiming to sell themselves off to a major player.
[4223.24 → 4229.26] Is there any subsection of the market, maybe such as high-end leisure products, that could avoid that future?
[4229.26 → 4238.44] I mean, as far as I can tell, the point of starting a business is, um, to make money.
[4239.16 → 4239.56] What?
[4239.56 → 4246.12] And the best way to make money is to find some sucker with a lot of money and take it off their hands for them.
[4246.20 → 4249.84] That's like how, yeah, that is the goal in software is to sell, generally.
[4249.84 → 4254.54] I mean, that's the goal in basically anything that's not mom and pop.
[4254.62 → 4262.36] And I feel like, I mean, I wasn't around when it was any different, but I feel like it wasn't always like that.
[4262.44 → 4273.04] Like the point of running a business was to serve your customers and make money, but not make more than you make necessarily by just selling to someone else.
[4273.04 → 4276.54] Um, but part of it is like, it seems to be driven both ways.
[4276.54 → 4286.86] I've talked about this before, but I have that friend who's a vet who bought the practice that she worked at and ended up bidding against a large veterinary acquisition company.
[4287.38 → 4289.74] Um, and so it seems to be a push-pull, right?
[4289.78 → 4298.12] Because on the one hand, you've got people whose goal, whose sole goal, uh, when they created their business was to sell it for as much as possible.
[4298.12 → 4306.04] But then you've also got these acquisition companies who exist only to acquire other businesses, not to create, not to create anything.
[4306.94 → 4320.38] And, you know, that's can sometimes lead to really tragic results because someone who wasn't there and didn't build it with their sweat, blood and tears is not necessarily going.
[4320.38 → 4327.70] I shouldn't say not is never going to treat something with the same respect as someone who did.
[4327.70 → 4334.46] And, uh, you see this time and time again, uh, Warner brothers getting into our next topic here, shut down rooster teeth.
[4334.46 → 4343.50] Now I want to kind of preface this with saying I didn't really consume rooster teeth content.
[4343.74 → 4347.84] I didn't follow any of the controversies that have taken place.
[4347.84 → 4353.72] I don't know if they were resolved and everything was cool or if they were not resolved.
[4353.72 → 4360.06] So there could be a myriad of reasons, uh, why rooster teeth shut down.
[4360.30 → 4365.62] But what we know for sure is Warner brothers has shut them down.
[4365.70 → 4369.30] At least 150 full-time employees will lose their jobs.
[4369.66 → 4370.62] Um, whoa.
[4370.62 → 4378.58] And many of rooster teeth existing properties will either be sold or transferred elsewhere within its parent company.
[4378.58 → 4385.78] Um, Warner brothers hasn't, uh, that hasn't been the only controversial move that Warner brothers has made recently.
[4385.78 → 4397.40] Uh, Warner brothers is also delisting an unknown number of game titles originally published by another subsidiary, Adult Swim, according to several of the game's developers.
[4397.40 → 4412.22] Uh, Michael Minardi, I think this might be a typo in my doc, but anyway, the creator of sound dodger plus says he begged his Warner Bros rep to transfer ownership of the game to him on steam rather than remove it.
[4412.30 → 4416.20] Since seeing as he still owned the IP and the game rights.
[4416.32 → 4417.46] And this is a quote.
[4417.46 → 4425.04] I sent him a link to steam's transfer page and explained clearly that it takes literally three clicks to transfer the ownership to me.
[4425.04 → 4427.02] He rejected my request.
[4427.24 → 4433.70] So the problem with this is not that it necessarily affects the ability of the game to still be available.
[4433.90 → 4440.98] He can relist it himself because he owns the rights, which is really great, but he loses anyone who ever wish listed the game.
[4441.06 → 4445.10] He loses all the reviews of the game, the historical reviews of the game.
[4445.10 → 4455.58] Um, another dev, Owen Deary, uh, responded by offering a free download of his game, small radios, big televisions on his website, rather than have it completely disappear.
[4456.22 → 4463.42] Um, so our discussion question is why would Warner Bros delist these games rather than just leaving them alone?
[4463.42 → 4470.82] Um, the only thing that I can possibly guess tax thing, uh, that's one possible option.
[4470.82 → 4481.50] Uh, speaking, speaking of, uh, seamless transitions into other topics, I definitely have some more to say about, uh, tax write-offs and tax deductions later on the show.
[4481.50 → 4487.48] Because anyway, it's the whole thing this week from the, uh, from the we read mean comments video.
[4487.48 → 4491.80] Um, but that, that's one, that's one potential option.
[4491.92 → 4502.18] Another one is they just, uh, don't want to fund development of these and make sure that they don't have any security potential liability.
[4502.34 → 4503.18] I, I don't know.
[4503.20 → 4503.58] I don't know.
[4503.64 → 4512.48] I, I, it's hard for me to imagine a mindset where you have something that is, as far as I can tell, completely passive.
[4512.48 → 4524.04] Um, requires no input from you whatsoever and generates any amount of revenue, however small and just going, you know what?
[4524.06 → 4525.36] I'll just turn that off.
[4525.98 → 4528.24] I just, I, I can't, I don't get it.
[4528.62 → 4530.32] It doesn't make any sense to me.
[4531.24 → 4534.86] Um, does anyone have any additional context for this float plane chat?
[4534.94 → 4535.16] Anyone?
[4535.44 → 4536.10] I don't think so.
[4536.68 → 4541.96] I also don't think like, I think it's fairly accepted that games, especially single player games,
[4541.96 → 4544.94] like they're not going to get security updates past a certain point and kind of who cares.
[4545.50 → 4553.12] One dev, according to Anthe Kai, um, was told that he could relist the game if he removed everyone in Adult Swim games from the credits.
[4553.96 → 4554.70] Like what?
[4556.14 → 4557.08] I, uh.
[4557.26 → 4557.64] Weird.
[4559.22 → 4560.26] I don't get it.
[4560.82 → 4561.34] Very weird.
[4561.38 → 4562.30] Yeah, I don't really get it.
[4562.88 → 4568.94] Um, I, I saw you kind of, I saw you kind of Googling, uh, Rooster Teeth.
[4568.94 → 4573.08] Did, uh, were you, were you checking if their controversies were resolved, or what were you up to do?
[4573.08 → 4573.90] No, I looked that up.
[4574.14 → 4582.82] Um, they like fired somebody for something and there's some other stuff, but there's, they've, they've existed for so long that there's like been stuff over the years.
[4582.82 → 4584.56] It seems like they've mostly resolved it though.
[4585.26 → 4587.68] Uh, this is what I was more recently looking at.
[4588.34 → 4589.62] Oh, Adult Swim games.
[4589.74 → 4589.98] Okay.
[4590.00 → 4590.90] What are we looking at here?
[4591.48 → 4592.54] What about Unicorn Attack?
[4592.68 → 4593.54] One of my favourites.
[4593.54 → 4595.76] Oh, okay.
[4596.26 → 4598.50] The, the, the Rick and Morty games.
[4598.58 → 4599.52] There's a few of them in here.
[4599.92 → 4602.30] Uh, Rick and Morty, the virtual game thingy.
[4602.30 → 4602.52] Yeah.
[4603.16 → 4604.30] And Pocket Morty's.
[4605.50 → 4606.76] What else are we looking at?
[4607.20 → 4608.92] I don't recognize.
[4609.32 → 4610.36] I don't recognize most of these.
[4610.36 → 4611.22] Most of these.
[4611.24 → 4612.46] That doesn't mean that it's okay.
[4613.54 → 4615.78] We have no idea exactly how many.
[4615.78 → 4617.98] I had no idea there was a robot Unicorn Attack 2.
[4618.10 → 4618.88] Being delisted.
[4620.48 → 4621.40] Is it any good?
[4621.40 → 4622.12] I don't know.
[4623.14 → 4623.34] Hmm.
[4623.54 → 4626.50] I don't know if I'll be able to know now.
[4627.80 → 4628.20] Hmm.
[4628.36 → 4631.86] I don't see number two on Steam right now.
[4632.04 → 4635.28] In fact, I don't see any robot Unicorn Attack on Steam right now.
[4636.56 → 4638.62] Is it already, is it already pulled?
[4638.72 → 4639.64] I don't think, I don't know.
[4639.78 → 4641.74] I don't think the first one was ever on Steam.
[4641.78 → 4642.24] Oh, okay.
[4642.42 → 4644.36] This isn't a list of their games that are on Steam.
[4644.46 → 4645.58] This is just a list of their games.
[4648.32 → 4649.68] Well, where, where do you buy it?
[4651.42 → 4652.74] Uh, the first one you didn't buy.
[4652.74 → 4653.72] It was just a free web game.
[4654.52 → 4654.96] Oh, okay.
[4655.02 → 4657.24] Robot Unicorn Attack 2 is on mobile.
[4657.88 → 4658.18] Ah.
[4659.32 → 4663.88] So maybe, maybe it's just like a mobile port that's not really a 2, or I'm not sure.
[4664.22 → 4664.62] Not sure.
[4664.62 → 4671.92] But yeah, that sucks.
[4673.12 → 4673.56] Yeah.
[4673.56 → 4675.92] Anytime, anytime this kind of stuff happens, it sucks.
[4676.28 → 4678.74] Um, I like physical media.
[4678.88 → 4679.80] Physical media is good.
[4679.80 → 4685.08] Now, if it's physical media that just like links you to a thing that you have to download
[4685.08 → 4687.82] from, then it is irrelevant and doesn't matter.
[4687.94 → 4689.70] But real physical media is good.
[4691.08 → 4694.66] Apparently, 150 people working for Rooster Teeth.
[4694.78 → 4695.40] That's a lot.
[4695.86 → 4697.28] It does seem like kind of a lot.
[4697.64 → 4699.10] How many shows and stuff did they have?
[4699.18 → 4700.64] I know they have their own dedicated website.
[4700.64 → 4700.68] Right.
[4701.40 → 4702.36] So that'll be a chunk of it.
[4704.56 → 4706.00] I'm really not sure.
[4706.26 → 4712.30] I, I, I don't know what the, uh, I don't know what the revenue model was.
[4712.30 → 4717.50] It was bought by Full-screen, which in turn was bought by Otter Media before Rooster Teeth
[4717.50 → 4721.12] became part of Warner Media under AT&T's ownership in 2022.
[4721.74 → 4725.52] Discovery closed the acquisition of Warner Media to form Warner Bros. Discovery.
[4725.76 → 4725.88] Okay.
[4726.00 → 4727.70] So it's changed hands a lot.
[4728.18 → 4728.40] Whoa.
[4728.70 → 4733.92] I don't really know how this works, but I went to, uh, Rooster Teeth's website and clicked
[4733.92 → 4734.94] on shows.
[4736.30 → 4738.84] And, uh, this, this is a lot of stuff.
[4739.78 → 4740.44] Oh, wow.
[4740.48 → 4740.74] Okay.
[4740.74 → 4743.42] So is this stuff that people are watching?
[4744.18 → 4744.62] Wow.
[4745.44 → 4747.24] I don't know how to tell that.
[4747.64 → 4752.30] Apparently in addition to the 150 employees, there's also like tons of contractors and stuff
[4752.30 → 4754.86] to that are, that are getting the boot.
[4755.16 → 4756.60] This is so many different things.
[4759.14 → 4764.64] I know at one point they were like killing it with their own streaming service.
[4764.64 → 4770.34] Like they were, they had like tens of thousands of subscribers, like monthly subscribers and stuff
[4770.34 → 4770.84] like that.
[4771.68 → 4773.72] This is actually just getting to be ridiculous.
[4773.94 → 4776.54] I'm wondering like how many episodes all these things have.
[4779.40 → 4781.24] And is this actually all made by them?
[4781.36 → 4782.00] Like, wow.
[4784.38 → 4785.90] Well, how old is some of this stuff?
[4786.02 → 4786.56] Click something.
[4787.40 → 4788.14] Like, yeah.
[4788.16 → 4788.68] What's that?
[4788.84 → 4788.90] How?
[4789.36 → 4791.40] When's the last time this got an update?
[4791.62 → 4792.28] Four seasons.
[4792.54 → 4792.76] Sorry.
[4792.86 → 4793.14] Not four.
[4793.20 → 4793.38] Okay.
[4793.38 → 4794.40] Play latest episode.
[4795.40 → 4795.76] 2016.
[4795.76 → 4795.96] 2016.
[4796.74 → 4797.10] Okay.
[4797.32 → 4797.64] Okay.
[4801.30 → 4801.78] Nice.
[4803.70 → 4804.18] Yeah.
[4804.26 → 4804.58] Okay.
[4805.74 → 4806.90] Ooh, not a single comment.
[4807.10 → 4809.22] That's not a good indicator.
[4809.48 → 4809.96] Hmm.
[4811.98 → 4813.60] Well, okay.
[4814.42 → 4815.04] Uh, yeah.
[4815.62 → 4819.16] People are saying it seems like at some point Rooster Teeth had the mindset of green lighting
[4819.16 → 4821.44] just about anything and seeing what sticks.
[4821.44 → 4827.66] Uh, Arbiter K says, if LMG sells, please sell to good people and not to a Warner Bros type.
[4827.66 → 4831.62] And that, I think, brings us full circle back around to the point that I was trying to make
[4831.62 → 4837.80] as I transitioned into this topic, that there is nobody who would buy LMG who would treat
[4837.80 → 4838.96] it the way that we did.
[4839.76 → 4843.06] And it's possible that we could find someone pretty good.
[4843.06 → 4848.76] I think that the, the party that, that made an acquisition offer, was it last year or the
[4848.76 → 4849.24] year before?
[4849.92 → 4851.78] They seemed pretty good.
[4851.84 → 4856.46] They were pretty darn close to what we would be looking for if, if we were to do something
[4856.46 → 4856.92] like that.
[4856.96 → 4859.74] But I think as you guys have seen, uh, we didn't do that.
[4859.76 → 4866.12] And instead we've made, uh, significant reinvestments for the future, and we're, we're sticking
[4866.12 → 4868.08] around whether you like it or not.
[4869.86 → 4871.10] So get over it.
[4871.10 → 4875.10] Um, something, something taxes.
[4876.38 → 4878.22] Are we, are we done this topic or no?
[4878.58 → 4879.68] Oh, we can talk about taxes.
[4879.80 → 4879.96] Sure.
[4880.20 → 4881.02] Do you want to talk about taxes?
[4881.18 → 4883.12] Oh, there's more stuff and no, there isn't.
[4883.20 → 4883.44] Never mind.
[4883.62 → 4883.76] Yeah.
[4883.76 → 4884.72] We can talk about taxes.
[4884.90 → 4885.02] All right.
[4885.14 → 4885.58] What's up?
[4885.76 → 4892.22] So in our line, these mics are tax write-off basically free.
[4892.94 → 4895.80] Actually, I think, uh, I think they provided these mics.
[4895.88 → 4897.50] I don't think they're a write-off at all.
[4897.62 → 4900.02] They have to break them for them to become a tax write-off.
[4900.02 → 4901.68] These mic stands are tax write-off.
[4901.84 → 4902.48] Um, okay.
[4902.70 → 4902.96] Basically free.
[4903.20 → 4904.42] So just a second.
[4904.52 → 4907.06] Can you, can you just relax for a minute here?
[4908.10 → 4910.50] In the Linus reads mean comments video.
[4910.54 → 4911.06] He's shaking.
[4913.40 → 4914.32] It's vibrating.
[4914.32 → 4921.24] I ended up going off a little bit at the end of the video.
[4921.54 → 4921.68] Yeah.
[4921.76 → 4926.68] Because Elijah put up not one, but many comments from people.
[4926.84 → 4927.12] Yes.
[4927.20 → 4934.82] Talking about how, you know, whatever Linus just does whatever he does because it's a tax write-off.
[4934.94 → 4936.18] It's a tax write-off.
[4936.34 → 4936.46] Yeah.
[4936.46 → 4937.58] Um, true.
[4938.50 → 4941.82] And so I, I basically was like, okay, okay.
[4941.88 → 4942.70] I need money.
[4943.58 → 4945.34] I, I, I, I need money.
[4945.38 → 4947.10] And I got, I got a fake $100 bill.
[4947.22 → 4948.72] I even said it was fake in the video.
[4948.76 → 4950.52] The number of people that didn't realize it was fake.
[4950.62 → 4951.46] How could you rip that?
[4951.68 → 4952.48] You're so rich.
[4952.56 → 4953.44] You can just rip money.
[4954.50 → 4957.66] Oh, you are not helping.
[4957.66 → 4964.62] So I was like, okay, let's say I made a hundred dollars and I ripped it in half to demonstrate
[4964.62 → 4970.82] that by the time you pay corporate income tax, personal income tax, um, and it doesn't
[4970.82 → 4976.12] quite work like that because I don't have to pay both personal income tax and corporate
[4976.12 → 4976.84] income tax.
[4976.84 → 4983.98] I either pay personal income tax and the company doesn't pay tax on the revenue, or I pay corporate
[4983.98 → 4987.96] income tax and then pay out a shareholder dividend that works out about the same.
[4988.48 → 4989.96] So whatever.
[4990.42 → 4996.06] So by the time you pay income tax to get it into my own hands and the various, you know,
[4996.16 → 5000.54] other taxes that we deal with around here, a sales tax and whatever, uh, we're down to
[5000.54 → 5005.92] about half by the time I actually get the money and use it for anything.
[5006.52 → 5012.52] Um, and then I explained that if I use it to buy something, say for example, a slate,
[5012.52 → 5016.16] like a video slate, then I spend $50 on that.
[5016.50 → 5016.98] Okay.
[5017.02 → 5022.42] Now I have a slate, and then I still have to rip the remainder in half and I get only $25
[5022.42 → 5027.26] of my $100 to actually use and do anything with personally.
[5029.78 → 5035.40] Most people, it seems like followed along pretty well, but one of the comments was accusing
[5035.40 → 5039.20] me of using my pool as a tax write-off.
[5039.82 → 5040.10] You did.
[5040.10 → 5042.14] Really?
[5043.04 → 5043.44] Okay.
[5044.26 → 5045.18] Explain to me.
[5045.56 → 5045.98] Yeah.
[5046.20 → 5047.60] This is not financial advice.
[5048.14 → 5050.40] How I can use my pool as a tax write-off.
[5050.46 → 5051.58] Use it for work events.
[5051.80 → 5052.40] It's in videos.
[5055.50 → 5066.42] Do you have any idea how far the CRA would kick my rectum up into my body if I tried to
[5066.42 → 5068.68] write-off my pool on my taxes?
[5070.46 → 5071.54] Used for work events.
[5072.12 → 5076.22] Used very specifically for video, multiple videos, really.
[5076.38 → 5078.52] I mean, your house could be just an entire tax write-off.
[5078.58 → 5079.62] We've shot videos in it before.
[5080.12 → 5080.36] Yeah.
[5080.36 → 5080.98] Oh, yeah.
[5081.36 → 5082.50] We could be making money.
[5082.50 → 5086.16] You guys are actually behaving like ignorant viewers right now.
[5086.58 → 5088.24] That's what you guys are doing right now.
[5088.30 → 5088.88] That's the gold.
[5089.42 → 5090.76] I hate you so much.
[5090.92 → 5091.32] Both of you.
[5093.70 → 5095.82] This will maybe make you feel better.
[5096.06 → 5100.32] Some people said that you didn't say that it was fake, and I had people go look at it.
[5100.44 → 5101.50] You did say it was fake.
[5101.60 → 5101.78] Yeah.
[5102.04 → 5102.40] Confirmed.
[5102.40 → 5102.60] Confirmed.
[5102.60 → 5103.76] I know I said it was fake.
[5103.88 → 5104.74] Of course I said it was fake.
[5104.90 → 5105.14] Confirmed.
[5105.14 → 5105.18] Confirmed.
[5105.18 → 5108.48] I'm not going to admit to a felony offence on camera.
[5108.98 → 5109.88] Not that stupid.
[5110.44 → 5111.34] Like writing off your pool?
[5111.64 → 5113.08] Like writing off my pool.
[5114.80 → 5119.10] So, I just want to back up a little bit here.
[5119.10 → 5126.06] The number of people that think, because people did point out that what I said was an oversimplification.
[5126.78 → 5134.74] Linus, you don't have $50 and taxes or $25 and taxes.
[5135.02 → 5138.10] You have $25 and a slate.
[5138.70 → 5142.50] And you paid some taxes, and you paid half as much tax.
[5142.62 → 5143.06] I thought you said that.
[5143.28 → 5143.84] I did.
[5143.92 → 5144.22] I did.
[5144.22 → 5150.88] But what they seem to have a hard time with is that I do not have a slate.
[5151.28 → 5152.36] The company does.
[5152.36 → 5156.24] Linus Media Group Incorporated has a slate.
[5156.70 → 5157.18] Which he owns.
[5157.32 → 5159.04] I don't need a slate though.
[5159.56 → 5161.14] I can't eat a slate.
[5161.44 → 5163.02] I can't drive a slate.
[5163.38 → 5164.84] I can't swim in a slate.
[5165.04 → 5166.16] You could definitely drive a slate.
[5166.64 → 5170.14] So, Linus Media Group Incorporated should own the pool in your car.
[5171.08 → 5171.60] No.
[5173.50 → 5177.20] Because, and so, I will...
[5177.20 → 5178.62] You can rent it from the company.
[5178.62 → 5179.10] No.
[5179.10 → 5179.74] No.
[5179.74 → 5179.82] No.
[5180.14 → 5186.58] You set up a subsidiary corporation, which you own, that rents it from Linus Media Group,
[5187.10 → 5190.08] that then is paid for by Linus Media Group.
[5190.16 → 5191.92] So, it's like infinite money.
[5191.92 → 5194.86] If there was...
[5194.86 → 5195.60] This is not financial advice.
[5195.60 → 5199.98] If there was actually an infinite money glitch, everyone would use it.
[5200.06 → 5203.96] And all of this is going to vary depending on your tax jurisdiction.
[5204.22 → 5210.92] But what I can tell you guys about ours is that, no, not every meal I eat is a tax write-off.
[5211.56 → 5214.88] No, not everything that I own is a tax write-off.
[5214.94 → 5216.56] That's actually not how it works.
[5216.56 → 5217.00] Because...
[5217.00 → 5218.96] Now, I will say this.
[5218.98 → 5219.44] Except for the pool.
[5219.72 → 5222.46] If we were to use the pool for a shoot.
[5223.02 → 5223.26] Okay.
[5223.40 → 5224.26] What I could do...
[5224.26 → 5224.60] Oh, yeah.
[5224.68 → 5225.56] Like a portion, whatever.
[5225.66 → 5234.68] What I could do is, if I were to set up a separate business entity, or I, the person,
[5234.82 → 5235.56] were to...
[5236.38 → 5237.70] What's it called?
[5237.70 → 5243.10] If I were just to operate as, like, an independent contractor, and I were to reconcile all of
[5243.10 → 5248.30] this on my annual, like, personal taxes and everything, what I could do is, I, the owner
[5248.30 → 5257.16] of the pool, who paid for it with after-tax money, could make an invoice for the company,
[5257.74 → 5265.50] billing the company to rent our pool as a location for a shoot, and then the company could pay
[5265.50 → 5269.68] me, and then I could report that income, and then I could pay my income tax on that.
[5270.30 → 5275.72] That is a way that I could subsidize the construction of the pool.
[5277.30 → 5278.68] But I could...
[5278.68 → 5279.24] No, no, I could.
[5279.34 → 5279.70] I could.
[5279.90 → 5280.54] It's possible.
[5280.64 → 5282.38] Kind of like how if you...
[5282.38 → 5283.90] Is it bad, though?
[5283.90 → 5287.90] If you have a house, you can write off part of your...
[5287.90 → 5292.44] Either your mortgage or the interest on your mortgage, or, like, you can write off part
[5292.44 → 5298.30] of your house expense, if you have a certain square footage that you use as an office space...
[5298.30 → 5298.86] That's what I do.
[5299.70 → 5299.86] Yep.
[5299.96 → 5305.72] Yes, that's totally legit, as long as you're actually using it for work, for, like, a revenue-generating
[5305.72 → 5306.38] enterprise.
[5306.56 → 5309.18] And you put down a percentage of how much you used it in a year, right?
[5309.18 → 5310.44] But, folks...
[5312.44 → 5313.08] No.
[5314.10 → 5315.06] Like, really?
[5315.44 → 5316.44] Like...
[5316.44 → 5320.46] Oh, there are some good ideas in Twitch chat, though.
[5320.46 → 5321.26] What now?
[5321.26 → 5323.56] What if we hosted the after-party from the pool?
[5326.50 → 5328.96] Twitch, do we really need more hot tub streams?
[5329.38 → 5329.80] Okay.
[5330.02 → 5330.94] Is that really what you want?
[5331.10 → 5331.36] Yes.
[5334.12 → 5335.68] Oh, hot tub super checks.
[5336.10 → 5336.92] How'd I get it?
[5336.98 → 5338.46] Hot tub super checks.
[5339.16 → 5339.56] Yeah!
[5340.02 → 5341.14] Now we're talking.
[5341.90 → 5342.56] Oh, my goodness.
[5342.56 → 5343.96] Hot tub super checks.
[5343.96 → 5345.26] The splash goals?
[5345.36 → 5347.56] Like, after someone scores the like, big splash?
[5347.76 → 5348.04] Yeah.
[5348.36 → 5349.54] That would be hype, dude.
[5349.54 → 5350.18] So, yeah.
[5350.34 → 5351.26] Mine is ignoring us.
[5351.26 → 5357.64] Some people seem to understand that while that was an oversimplification, that is basically
[5357.64 → 5358.36] how it works.
[5358.48 → 5359.78] And there's a lot...
[5359.78 → 5367.10] There are a lot of regulations that dictate what I'm allowed to write off and what I'm not
[5367.10 → 5368.06] allowed to write off.
[5368.14 → 5371.78] For example, the EV chargers that we have here at the office.
[5371.78 → 5380.26] If I install them in a parking stall that is designated for my use, I cannot expense those.
[5381.46 → 5383.90] And I cannot participate in any subsidies.
[5384.28 → 5385.86] What if you did for Taryn?
[5386.88 → 5387.14] No.
[5387.14 → 5394.20] However, if they are for general reuse of the employees, then...
[5394.20 → 5394.48] Oh, wait.
[5394.52 → 5394.76] No, no.
[5394.80 → 5395.12] Hold on.
[5395.16 → 5395.40] Hold on.
[5395.96 → 5396.44] Hold on.
[5396.48 → 5396.66] Hold on.
[5396.70 → 5397.48] No, this one was separate.
[5398.28 → 5403.16] If it is for my personal use, then it counts as a taxable benefit.
[5403.48 → 5403.94] That's right.
[5404.08 → 5404.22] Yeah.
[5404.22 → 5410.92] So a taxable benefit is something that the company pays for, but that you, the employee,
[5411.14 → 5412.76] still have to pay personal tax on.
[5412.98 → 5420.58] So if I were to, as the business owner, install an EV charger in a stall that only I can use,
[5421.10 → 5427.96] then any money of the use of that charger and the electricity use counts as a taxable benefit
[5427.96 → 5432.74] for me that I have to declare on my personal taxes and pay tax on, even though the company
[5432.74 → 5434.36] never actually gave me any cash.
[5434.92 → 5441.12] So that's the kind of loophole closing that they do to make it so that I can't have Luke
[5441.12 → 5443.70] who makes $10,000 a year.
[5443.84 → 5445.60] So he only has to pay like...
[5445.60 → 5446.44] So we're back to NCX.
[5447.24 → 5449.30] Zero income tax, which would be nice.
[5449.30 → 5457.86] And then I just give him $40,000 a year in Costco gift cards and $10,000 a year in Cineplex
[5457.86 → 5458.76] gift cards.
[5458.92 → 5459.40] Wow.
[5459.50 → 5462.68] And $10,000 a year in Steam gift cards.
[5462.84 → 5463.20] Wow.
[5463.32 → 5463.54] Right?
[5464.58 → 5466.26] I've got weird priorities.
[5466.50 → 5471.70] Anything that has a cash equivalency, he would have to pay income tax on.
[5472.00 → 5477.56] You can't just pay people in gift cards and vacations and like, ha ha, we figured out
[5477.56 → 5478.18] the system.
[5478.18 → 5479.86] We beat the system.
[5480.32 → 5483.64] Whereas there is a carve out here in BC anyway.
[5483.86 → 5489.84] If we install an EV charger that is for anyone to use and does not belong to any...
[5489.84 → 5494.34] That is not in like a designated parking stall, then nobody has to pay...
[5494.34 → 5496.06] Has to count as a taxable benefit.
[5496.42 → 5500.28] Anyone can use it, and you just essentially get to charge for free on the...
[5500.28 → 5506.68] Well, the company pays for it, but the company gets to write off our energy usage because that's
[5506.68 → 5507.48] not money we made.
[5507.48 → 5509.86] You don't pay income tax on money you didn't make.
[5511.40 → 5511.84] Right?
[5511.94 → 5515.26] So we write off the taxes, and then they don't have to pay income tax.
[5515.30 → 5516.30] So it's optimization.
[5516.74 → 5517.48] But no one is actually...
[5518.28 → 5522.62] No one is able to avoid paying taxes outright unless they are...
[5522.62 → 5523.28] Unless you expense...
[5523.28 → 5525.66] Unless you are doing something very...
[5525.66 → 5528.20] Either very clever or very illegal.
[5528.62 → 5534.58] And so if you were to say, well, yeah, but Linus could just expense his car because he could
[5534.58 → 5538.80] write off his car because he shoots videos with it in it once in a while.
[5538.96 → 5543.18] And he could write off his pool because they shoot videos once in a while.
[5543.42 → 5543.72] Yeah.
[5543.72 → 5547.74] You could also walk into a grocery store and fucking take everything in it.
[5548.24 → 5549.14] You could.
[5549.38 → 5552.54] But if anyone catches you, then it's going to be a problem unless you live in California.
[5554.86 → 5557.16] You could not return the shopping trolley.
[5557.18 → 5560.10] No, if you took everything in it, you would exceed the limit.
[5560.10 → 5560.92] The limit.
[5561.32 → 5561.72] Anarchy.
[5561.82 → 5562.56] I mean, that's true.
[5562.72 → 5562.88] Yeah.
[5563.08 → 5563.34] Yeah.
[5563.54 → 5564.54] Groceries are really expensive.
[5564.60 → 5565.28] That's a whole thing.
[5565.42 → 5565.58] Yeah.
[5565.82 → 5567.72] You probably couldn't even get like two grocery carts.
[5569.30 → 5570.02] Thanks, Luke.
[5570.14 → 5570.78] That's...
[5570.78 → 5571.56] Life sucks.
[5572.48 → 5573.78] You know why life sucks?
[5573.92 → 5575.60] Because we can't expense our pools.
[5577.62 → 5578.28] That's why.
[5579.12 → 5581.78] God, it's so difficult being wealthy and rich.
[5585.16 → 5589.88] Duck3269 says, at Linus, during the WAN show, you talked about potentially buying a Samsung
[5589.88 → 5590.42] wall.
[5590.92 → 5593.86] Luke said, it's stupid for anyone to pay that much for a TV.
[5594.10 → 5597.92] And you said, it's not going to be that much because you will make some videos to subsidize
[5597.92 → 5598.40] the cost.
[5598.84 → 5602.32] Statements like this make it seem like you're buying expensive things and using making videos
[5602.32 → 5603.60] as a way of subsidizing the cost.
[5603.72 → 5604.20] I am.
[5604.58 → 5604.78] Yeah.
[5605.22 → 5606.76] That's not tax write-offs.
[5606.90 → 5607.72] That's a totally different thing.
[5607.72 → 5607.90] Yeah.
[5607.96 → 5615.40] Even if I have to pay tax on the income, if I get content out of it, I'm going to make
[5615.40 → 5617.40] money on the content.
[5617.40 → 5619.14] It has not...
[5619.14 → 5620.80] That's super above board.
[5620.86 → 5621.52] Yeah, that's fine.
[5621.60 → 5624.26] The government actually really wants you to do that.
[5624.44 → 5624.66] Yeah.
[5625.26 → 5626.38] If they're...
[5626.38 → 5628.16] They want more money to move around.
[5628.50 → 5630.86] Because when more money moves around, more taxes move around.
[5630.92 → 5632.24] That's like the whole point of the economy.
[5632.44 → 5632.60] Yeah.
[5632.70 → 5633.38] Is to buy things.
[5633.44 → 5633.66] Yeah.
[5633.94 → 5638.12] Elijah, bro, he wouldn't have bought the 115-inch TV if he couldn't make a fucking video.
[5638.12 → 5646.92] Guys, 99% of the tech that I acquire is to make a video.
[5647.14 → 5652.66] The camera that you are watching this through, the laptop in front of me, this stream deck.
[5652.80 → 5653.60] Weird fun fact.
[5653.72 → 5653.86] Yeah.
[5653.86 → 5659.66] His house was less of a tech disaster back when we didn't make videos about it.
[5659.90 → 5660.18] Yeah.
[5660.54 → 5661.46] Because I just...
[5661.46 → 5663.62] It was like actually fine and everything worked.
[5664.20 → 5665.72] And he even had like...
[5665.72 → 5668.66] You'd have like a controller die, and he'd be like, I have a solution for this.
[5668.72 → 5672.62] I have the world's biggest battery charger and 17 N-a loops, and we can just immediately
[5672.62 → 5673.48] solve the problem.
[5673.92 → 5674.44] And there was like...
[5674.44 → 5677.10] Everything worked all the time and there were batteries for everything and everything
[5677.10 → 5677.52] was fine.
[5677.78 → 5680.46] And then now he makes videos about it and everything's...
[5680.46 → 5683.84] Well, the problem is that other people who don't have to live their work on the videos.
[5684.04 → 5684.62] Ah, okay.
[5684.74 → 5685.60] I mean, that makes sense.
[5685.60 → 5686.54] And so...
[5686.54 → 5690.22] But so you wouldn't have to do that if you didn't do this whole thing, but the content's
[5690.22 → 5691.26] good, so you do it anyway.
[5692.48 → 5693.78] I do it on purpose.
[5694.02 → 5695.38] I suffer for you.
[5696.12 → 5703.24] I legitimately love new tech and I love tinkering around with things, and it's not like we're
[5703.24 → 5707.28] not doing things that I'm approving or are my idea in the first place.
[5707.28 → 5710.28] But I would...
[5711.28 → 5717.22] A lot of what we do is done the way that we do it because who else would do it that way?
[5717.44 → 5723.84] I did not need to use solar panels and server heat to augment my pool heating.
[5725.42 → 5726.28] I didn't.
[5727.36 → 5728.18] That's stupid.
[5728.44 → 5732.02] You didn't need to use your pool to cool your server room.
[5732.16 → 5732.38] No.
[5732.96 → 5733.58] Not even a little.
[5733.64 → 5735.12] There are a lot of other ways to do it.
[5735.20 → 5735.78] If I...
[5735.78 → 5736.56] Easier, cheaper.
[5736.56 → 5738.40] Way cheaper, way easier.
[5738.58 → 5740.34] I could have just put air conditioning in there.
[5740.56 → 5746.06] In fact, I have air conditioning capacity for that room.
[5746.66 → 5749.28] I choose not to use it.
[5749.74 → 5754.42] A, because I feel like it's pretty stupid to air condition in the winter when you could
[5754.42 → 5757.54] just move the heat through much more energy efficient means.
[5757.80 → 5757.98] Okay.
[5758.26 → 5759.28] Like, you know.
[5759.58 → 5760.10] Cool.
[5760.44 → 5760.72] Yep.
[5760.86 → 5761.34] I like it.
[5761.34 → 5765.76] And B, because that's lame.
[5766.56 → 5770.84] When you could put a water cooling loop in your server room.
[5773.64 → 5779.92] So yes, if you have a conspiracy theory that I do things on hard mode just because it's
[5779.92 → 5784.96] hard mode and because it's more fun that way, you're right.
[5784.96 → 5786.38] I was just going to say, yeah.
[5789.30 → 5792.06] The amount of times we've been like, here's a video idea.
[5792.28 → 5793.50] It will be a banger.
[5793.88 → 5797.66] And he's like, ah, too easy.
[5798.34 → 5799.36] It's like, oh, okay.
[5800.08 → 5800.70] All right.
[5800.70 → 5802.56] Oh, man.
[5802.98 → 5803.48] That's great.
[5808.02 → 5808.88] Oh, sponsor.
[5809.02 → 5809.36] Oh, yeah.
[5809.42 → 5813.94] Speaking of, speaking of tax write-offs, let's write off this message from our sponsor,
[5814.04 → 5814.50] AG1.
[5815.38 → 5817.88] No one likes, I'm just going to say everything is right.
[5818.02 → 5818.34] What the?
[5818.34 → 5818.72] Whoa!
[5818.86 → 5820.88] What the f*** am I even watching right now?
[5820.98 → 5821.10] Whoa.
[5821.10 → 5824.82] No one likes swallowing things that they don't find tasty.
[5824.98 → 5825.32] Oh, wow.
[5825.52 → 5826.58] Like a lot of things.

[5850.24 → 5850.92] Oh.
[5851.56 → 5852.68] You know, I'll show it after.
[5852.96 → 5856.24] She's been drinking AG1 for over a year, even before they partnered with us.

[5875.64 → 5877.58] We're going to have that linked down below.
[5877.80 → 5878.24] All right.
[5878.24 → 5882.26] We're going to take a short break from sponsors real quick here to promote our own stuff.
[5883.22 → 5884.18] Oh, dang it.
[5884.32 → 5885.16] I clicked the wrong thing.
[5885.32 → 5886.04] One moment, please.
[5886.76 → 5886.96] Okay.
[5886.96 → 5887.48] Check this out.
[5887.98 → 5890.54] This is a really great exclusive over on Float plane.
[5890.56 → 5893.40] I have this opened in an extra tab at home, but I haven't, actually.
[5893.76 → 5896.60] Maria shares funny thumbnail drawings by our writers.
[5896.60 → 5900.22] So she's responsible for what you guys see.
[5900.72 → 5903.50] By the way, she's wearing one of my favourite hoodies right now, the dropout.
[5903.50 → 5904.18] The dropout hoodie, yeah.
[5904.26 → 5906.28] But we often provide her with guidance.
[5906.28 → 5906.40] Cool.
[5910.40 → 5911.66] Oh, I'm so excited.
[5911.66 → 5914.62] In order to, because a picture's worth a thousand words, right?
[5914.62 → 5920.76] In order to give her some idea of what exactly it is that we expect for the final thumbnail.
[5920.92 → 5921.82] So she did this.
[5921.96 → 5926.18] She did such a great job with this video of showing our version.
[5926.26 → 5926.80] Oh, wow.
[5927.52 → 5930.82] Versus what she ultimately creates.
[5930.82 → 5933.78] And I think probably the worst ones are mine.
[5934.18 → 5935.54] Oh, unfortunately.
[5935.94 → 5936.42] Wow.
[5936.52 → 5937.72] That's amazing.
[5938.96 → 5940.90] Except cables on the sides.
[5941.86 → 5943.46] Pretty much across the board.
[5943.60 → 5944.56] They're awful.
[5944.82 → 5948.14] I love the one of them has a triangle mouth and the other one just has a line.
[5948.44 → 5948.62] Yeah.
[5950.68 → 5951.24] Moon?
[5952.22 → 5952.74] Riley.
[5953.16 → 5953.50] Wow.
[5953.96 → 5954.82] Oh, man.
[5954.96 → 5955.76] Oh, it's a phone.
[5955.88 → 5956.10] Okay.
[5956.26 → 5956.50] Yeah.
[5956.72 → 5958.98] Oh, this is for the moonshot thing.
[5959.08 → 5959.30] Yeah.
[5959.30 → 5959.60] Yeah.
[5959.60 → 5959.84] Yeah.
[5961.36 → 5961.80] Yeah.
[5962.26 → 5963.24] So, anywho.
[5965.52 → 5967.12] It's really great.
[5967.30 → 5968.04] She did a great job.
[5968.12 → 5969.44] I'm even more excited to watch that.
[5969.62 → 5969.84] Yep.
[5971.16 → 5971.48] Okay.
[5971.58 → 5971.78] Sorry.
[5972.12 → 5972.56] Sponsors.
[5972.90 → 5974.88] The show is also brought to you by Oracle.
[5975.42 → 5984.90] If you're in London during March, you're probably inside, avoiding the rain and levelling up in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth instead of levelling up your career.
[5985.44 → 5986.92] What are these talking points?
[5986.92 → 5987.02] Yes.

[6084.56 → 6085.98] What would you like to talk about, Mr. Luke?
[6089.14 → 6089.54] Yeah.
[6090.22 → 6090.66] Yeah.
[6090.84 → 6091.20] All right.
[6091.22 → 6091.56] Hit me, Dan.
[6092.92 → 6093.36] Sure.
[6093.54 → 6094.36] Do we have to intro them?
[6094.70 → 6095.14] Say what they are?
[6095.22 → 6095.96] More merch messages.
[6096.54 → 6096.86] All right.
[6096.88 → 6097.30] Hit me, Dan.
[6097.54 → 6097.72] Wow.
[6097.86 → 6098.30] Professionals.
[6098.78 → 6101.18] Hello, employees of Yvonne Umbrella Corporation.
[6101.44 → 6107.92] With more and more places asking for biometrics to log in, what happens when a database of fingerprints gets hacked?
[6108.16 → 6109.38] Do I need new fingers?
[6110.04 → 6127.44] Theoretically, the biometric services that you're using, assuming you're talking about your iPhone, for example, theoretically, the way that it works is that the actual fingerprint itself is not stored on that third-party server.
[6127.64 → 6144.82] It's just a value is created from that fingerprint, and then it ensures locally on your device that you are close enough, and then it sends an authentication token that's like, yes, you biometrically authenticated, and we made sure that you did that.
[6144.94 → 6149.08] But you're not actually just shipping your fingerprint to anyone.
[6149.08 → 6151.82] However, there are exceptions to that.
[6151.90 → 6165.96] For example, I applied to renew my Nexus card yesterday, and you very much, in a government database, are storing your actual biometric information.
[6165.96 → 6180.06] So I didn't scan my fingerprint into my computer when I signed up for it, but that just reminded me that there are definitely places where there are gigantic treasure troves of real biometric data.
[6180.06 → 6184.04] Oh, yeah. Government hacks are brutal, and they happen.
[6184.34 → 6185.14] Did you do the retina?
[6185.54 → 6186.54] They have my retinas.
[6187.40 → 6187.58] Hmm.
[6188.10 → 6188.44] Nice.
[6188.44 → 6189.76] You can get new eyes.
[6190.14 → 6191.08] Yeah, that's easy.
[6191.38 → 6193.20] I don't think I've done the retina scan.
[6193.34 → 6194.42] That's for air travel.
[6194.58 → 6196.34] With U.S. border services.
[6196.78 → 6202.30] They definitely have facial ID for me, and they definitely have fingerprints for me, but I don't think they have anything else.
[6202.36 → 6205.68] Man, the number of countries that have my fingerprints is very unsettling.
[6205.68 → 6212.12] If I ever decided to be a criminal, I would have to be the kind that takes a belt sander to the old meat paws.
[6212.90 → 6213.26] Ouch.
[6213.70 → 6213.96] Yeah.
[6214.14 → 6214.64] A thing, though.
[6215.22 → 6215.78] A thing.
[6215.86 → 6216.54] Definitely a thing.
[6216.78 → 6217.02] Yeah.
[6217.02 → 6218.86] Prove I haven't already.
[6223.86 → 6226.16] Now Luke's mind contains my fingerprints, too.
[6226.34 → 6226.50] Yep.
[6227.40 → 6228.52] Or wear gloves.
[6229.20 → 6230.92] Luke, we don't have a policy on that.
[6231.02 → 6231.52] Says gold.
[6231.52 → 6233.76] Can we 2FA your fingerprints, please?
[6236.26 → 6238.52] Linus isn't allowed to show his...
[6238.52 → 6240.38] You have to unlock your phone.
[6240.52 → 6242.16] ...pads of his fingers to the camera anymore.
[6242.32 → 6243.18] Oh, yeah, there you go.
[6243.18 → 6248.58] Any updates on the UV reflective or blocking shirt you mentioned in the past?
[6249.02 → 6249.86] It might be dead.
[6250.92 → 6251.98] I'm very sorry.
[6251.98 → 6256.18] So what happened was there was a bit of a miscommunication.
[6257.14 → 6264.76] We were not moving forward with the original supplier for it due to things that were not our fault.
[6264.76 → 6275.04] And while I love the sample shirt that I have, we were not able to reach an agreement on moving forward with the mass production run.
[6275.04 → 6279.08] So we went in search of a new supplier for it.
[6279.08 → 6286.70] And somewhere in there, my requirements for the garment were not fully communicated.
[6286.70 → 6290.26] And we've got a new supplier, and we've got a new fabric.
[6290.84 → 6299.60] But while it has the UV blocking properties of the original fabric and a very similar hand feel, good stretch characteristics, everything's fine.
[6299.98 → 6307.28] What it doesn't have is the antimicrobial properties of the original garment, which was part of what I loved so much about it.
[6307.28 → 6318.20] So I could just wear this thing to the beach, go out swimming in the ocean, not do anything, just dry off and not stink and not be sunburned.
[6318.34 → 6320.86] It is a flipping awesome garment.
[6320.86 → 6330.20] However, there are problems with antimicrobial clothing construction techniques.
[6330.20 → 6341.52] You can put an antimicrobial treatment on it, but realistically, that's going to wash off in 20 washes, 30 at most, if you're lucky.
[6341.90 → 6347.18] Anything you see advertised as antimicrobial or in most cases waterproof, it's just a coating.
[6347.18 → 6351.52] And given that, man, what was that like perfect?
[6351.80 → 6353.32] There's a lot of really like high end.
[6353.64 → 6358.88] Stockyard doesn't exist anymore, not the way that it used to, which is a good thing because of how many people like died.
[6359.92 → 6360.64] It's a whole thing.
[6360.78 → 6360.96] I have no idea.
[6360.98 → 6361.76] That's a whole rabbit hole.
[6361.88 → 6364.62] Stockyard, as you know it on the shelf today, is not Stockyard.
[6365.14 → 6367.50] Yeah, it was like birth defects and like a whole thing.
[6367.80 → 6371.24] Yeah, the point is that these coatings are, they're nonsense.
[6371.24 → 6377.82] They're not intrinsic to the materials, so I don't feel comfortable advertising them.
[6378.28 → 6381.22] So we could have done that, but we're not going to do that.
[6381.28 → 6382.42] Now, there are alternatives.
[6382.92 → 6391.44] The thing that made the original garment antimicrobial was that it had a bamboo component to the fabric itself.
[6391.44 → 6409.16] But what our compliance person, who I don't know if they're off probation or not, and Tatiana, our materials specialist, have informed me of, is that bamboo, even though theoretically it's a super renewable resource,
[6409.16 → 6421.40] in most cases, the production of fabrics using bamboo is extremely environmentally harmful unless they're in like a closed system that involves recapture of some kind of something or other.
[6421.98 → 6425.12] And yes, you know, cotton is too, but bamboo is apparently horrible.
[6425.50 → 6426.54] Bamboo fabrics.
[6426.86 → 6426.98] Weird.
[6426.98 → 6437.46] So they basically presented that to me and were like, so, you know, it's your call.
[6437.64 → 6439.42] And I was like, no bamboo.
[6440.16 → 6441.06] Silver is an option.
[6441.18 → 6450.70] But silver has recently been found because of the size of the particles to have potential detrimental health effects on the people who wear it.
[6450.80 → 6456.18] So any silver in the fabric, not an option now that we know what we know about it.
[6456.18 → 6464.28] Yeah, I, um, Griselda in Philippine chat said, my wife is a biochemist PhD and teaches slash researches the microbiome.
[6464.38 → 6465.76] Don't get antimicrobial stuff.
[6465.90 → 6469.20] And as far as my understanding goes, yeah, that's like a thing.
[6470.30 → 6476.26] Because you're, you have, as like icky as it is, you're covered in it all the time.
[6476.46 → 6477.36] Well, I mean.
[6477.56 → 6478.12] And there's good stuff.
[6479.10 → 6480.56] You want to kill the good stuff.
[6480.72 → 6484.18] I doubt that just from wearing a loose fitting garment.
[6484.18 → 6485.98] It's not a shirt, right?
[6486.02 → 6486.88] It goes on top?
[6487.22 → 6490.40] Well, it's, it's, it was like a super light hoodie.
[6491.00 → 6491.24] Mm-hmm.
[6491.56 → 6493.22] So it was very loose fitting.
[6493.38 → 6501.14] And with the amount of body hair that I and probably a lot of you have realistically, it's not like it's killing everything on your skin.
[6501.26 → 6507.26] It's more that, it's more that whatever gets off of your skin onto it is not going to just fester there.
[6507.38 → 6507.60] Right.
[6507.60 → 6511.94] Um, so I'm not, I'm not, I'm not actually worried about that aspect of it, but.
[6512.28 → 6513.18] And like, I don't know.
[6513.74 → 6514.58] I, I don't know.
[6514.86 → 6515.14] Yeah.
[6515.22 → 6518.60] And people are saying it's almost like things harmful to microbes are also harmful to humans.
[6518.68 → 6522.88] I'm not convinced that bamboo containing fabric is particularly harmful to humans.
[6523.12 → 6524.06] I seriously doubt it.
[6524.06 → 6527.36] But I, um, but yeah, basically we're not, we're not doing it.
[6527.62 → 6536.68] Uh, merino wool has strong antimicrobial properties as well, but is very expensive to the point where that garment would be like $150 sun hoodie.
[6536.68 → 6539.52] And like, come on, what do we even?
[6539.70 → 6542.82] People already hate, we, we make cool merino wool things.
[6542.94 → 6543.68] People are like, it's really expensive.
[6543.76 → 6545.40] It's like, yeah, merino wool is really expensive.
[6545.50 → 6546.04] It's really expensive.
[6546.16 → 6547.68] I don't, especially when you like.
[6547.74 → 6548.72] I don't make the f***ING rules.
[6548.72 → 6549.80] Do cool things with it.
[6549.84 → 6552.72] Cause as far as my understanding goes, it's difficult to work with.
[6552.96 → 6559.82] So like, yeah, if you try to make more complex, better designs, it gets more difficult and more expensive.
[6560.02 → 6562.12] So a pretty scary rate.
[6562.12 → 6564.56] I've asked them if we can do it.
[6565.12 → 6576.80] Um, yeah, if, if, if we can, if we can do it, if we can find a source for a bamboo based fabric that does the recapture thing or whatever, I still, I still want to do it.
[6576.80 → 6583.24] But I, um, I think it's dead for now.
[6583.82 → 6588.06] But hey, positive side, I've got mine already.
[6590.98 → 6592.52] I mean, that's a write-off.
[6592.90 → 6593.52] Darn it.
[6594.36 → 6598.12] That, that is why we, that is why we develop things sometimes.
[6598.12 → 6599.56] Because it's just a thing that I want.
[6601.74 → 6602.14] Epic.
[6603.26 → 6603.66] All right.
[6603.76 → 6603.90] Next up.
[6604.02 → 6604.36] Next up.
[6604.46 → 6604.76] I think we have one more.
[6604.76 → 6605.14] Last one.
[6605.24 → 6605.64] Last one.
[6605.70 → 6605.82] Yeah.
[6605.82 → 6608.50] Uh, Hey guys, I've been loving my screwdriver.
[6608.92 → 6614.88] Have you guys noticed issues with DDR five on and platforms compared to Intel?
[6615.00 → 6617.28] I feel like it's worse boot times on AMD.
[6617.50 → 6620.72] Oh, I think you're talking about the memory training issues on AM five.
[6621.10 → 6635.56] Um, I don't consider it to be a huge problem, but the first time that you boot up an AM five system, there can be a long, and I mean long, like sometimes minutes long memory training period where the system does not indicate.
[6635.56 → 6636.80] In any meaningful way that it is doing anything.
[6636.80 → 6639.42] It's just doing anything and just sits there.
[6640.66 → 6644.80] Seeming like it's just on, but not outputting anything and doing nothing.
[6644.80 → 6646.38] And then suddenly, book, it works.
[6646.62 → 6649.00] And then every time you reboot after that, it's quite a bit faster.
[6649.66 → 6653.68] I'd love for them to make that better and smoother.
[6653.82 → 6658.60] It would seem like a more, you know, mature, refined experience if they did.
[6658.60 → 6667.82] But I don't think it's the end of the world because I haven't found overall on a well-optimized BIOS that subsequent boot times are really any, are really any worse.
[6668.44 → 6672.74] So minor problem in my humble opinion.
[6681.12 → 6681.52] Dan?
[6681.52 → 6681.56] Dan?
[6682.10 → 6683.88] Oh, you want, you want a fourth merch message?
[6683.92 → 6684.28] Oh, yeah, sure.
[6684.36 → 6684.94] Hit us with one more.
[6685.48 → 6685.88] Okay.
[6686.84 → 6691.68] Um, what does Luke think were the best and worst Linus lead development ideas?
[6691.86 → 6693.56] Linus lead development ideas?
[6693.70 → 6694.98] And can Linus guess what they are?
[6695.52 → 6696.46] It's been a while.
[6696.58 → 6697.42] I don't even remember.
[6697.54 → 6699.30] We haven't done things like that in a long time.
[6699.30 → 6703.66] I know the absolute first, no matter what, indisputable, and if you disagree with me, you're actually wrong one.
[6703.74 → 6704.84] I know that one for sure.
[6705.06 → 6706.88] What, like doing float plane at all?
[6707.42 → 6708.04] Uh, okay.
[6708.16 → 6709.58] I didn't go that far, but okay.
[6709.58 → 6713.12] Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm sure there were some terrible ideas on the forum.
[6713.54 → 6724.08] Uh, remember when we, remember when we launched like a half-baked, um, like way of, way of getting rid of old, like, uh, equipment?
[6724.64 → 6729.22] Like we, we did like auctions on, like live auctions on the forum.
[6729.36 → 6729.94] That was something.
[6730.12 → 6730.66] Live auctions?
[6730.80 → 6732.50] Yeah, remember it was, they were live.
[6732.60 → 6733.86] They were after the WAN show.
[6734.28 → 6737.84] I thought it was, I thought it, I thought we just announced it for sale, though.
[6737.84 → 6738.96] I didn't realize there's an auction.
[6739.58 → 6742.96] We remember we would sit there, and we would like to adjust the pricing.
[6745.04 → 6746.54] We've done some stuff, dude.
[6746.58 → 6748.20] I know, we've done some really weird stuff.
[6750.00 → 6751.00] No, live-streaming.
[6751.12 → 6752.30] The thing we're doing right now.
[6753.00 → 6755.64] I really wish we didn't go down this route.
[6756.32 → 6756.72] Um.
[6756.72 → 6758.16] But look at the float plane people.
[6758.26 → 6759.14] Look how happy they are.
[6759.20 → 6760.10] Yeah, okay, but we could have.
[6760.10 → 6760.94] Show them how happy you guys are.
[6760.94 → 6762.60] We could have had a chat.
[6762.72 → 6764.72] Some, some love, some love in the chat.
[6764.80 → 6768.72] We could have had a chat that enables when the live stream is live on other platforms.
[6768.72 → 6770.52] They would like it better like this.
[6771.52 → 6771.92] Yeah.
[6771.92 → 6773.70] I mean, Luke, it's just, it's a tax write-off.
[6773.70 → 6774.16] It's so.
[6775.72 → 6776.68] I think it is.
[6776.68 → 6779.38] My husband is ignoring my phone call for your show.
[6779.50 → 6782.42] Please let Martin Wen know that his dinner's in the fridge.
[6784.34 → 6785.30] Randy, your sticks?
[6785.30 → 6788.24] Oh, man.
[6788.52 → 6789.48] That's an old reference.
[6789.80 → 6791.36] That is an old reference.
[6792.58 → 6792.98] Um.
[6794.14 → 6795.02] Yeah, I don't know.
[6795.14 → 6796.44] There's other stuff like that.
[6797.12 → 6802.44] Most of it's like, uh, the, the problem was that we were trying to make a.
[6802.56 → 6803.86] Verified actual gamer program.
[6803.98 → 6805.04] That was Linus led development.
[6805.38 → 6806.40] That was pretty cool.
[6806.42 → 6806.98] That's pretty cool.
[6807.06 → 6808.76] I think that's probably the best one in my opinion.
[6809.02 → 6809.84] That one was pretty good.
[6809.90 → 6810.08] Yep.
[6810.26 → 6811.08] I'm not against that one.
[6811.08 → 6812.54] I wish we could have gotten more support for it.
[6812.56 → 6813.78] That also wasn't actually for float plane.
[6814.30 → 6814.54] No.
[6814.54 → 6815.62] That was entire.
[6815.88 → 6816.56] Full plane actually had.
[6816.64 → 6817.80] But they didn't say float plane.
[6818.24 → 6820.34] They just said the best Linus led development ideas.
[6820.46 → 6820.66] Fair.
[6820.90 → 6821.32] Yeah, yeah.
[6821.46 → 6821.62] Yeah.
[6821.62 → 6821.82] Yeah.
[6821.82 → 6822.90] I really liked that.
[6822.96 → 6823.86] That was a cool project.
[6823.86 → 6828.16] And I, I wish we got more use out of it, but it wasn't a one-off.
[6828.80 → 6828.94] No.
[6829.04 → 6829.94] It was at least.
[6829.94 → 6830.50] It was three or four times.
[6830.68 → 6831.68] I think more even.
[6832.00 → 6832.20] No.
[6832.66 → 6833.08] Unfortunately.
[6833.08 → 6833.90] There was the text one.
[6834.06 → 6835.18] There was the picture one.
[6835.26 → 6835.44] Yep.
[6835.62 → 6836.04] The game.
[6836.34 → 6837.98] The game was used multiple times.
[6838.40 → 6842.42] And there was, there was one where it was mixed of text, text and pictures.
[6842.52 → 6842.68] Okay.
[6842.68 → 6843.02] So five.
[6843.02 → 6849.12] We did three before the game and then the game got at least, the game got two or three
[6849.12 → 6849.42] plays.
[6849.50 → 6850.12] I don't remember how many.
[6850.12 → 6850.48] I think two.
[6850.82 → 6851.06] Okay.
[6851.24 → 6851.44] Yeah.
[6851.50 → 6852.32] It wasn't that many.
[6852.64 → 6854.58] I do wish the game got more use.
[6854.58 → 6861.48] I do wish that more GPU makers had actually cared.
[6861.68 → 6861.90] Yeah.
[6861.90 → 6865.56] About their GPUs ending up in the hands of gamers at a reasonable price.
[6865.86 → 6866.00] Yeah.
[6866.06 → 6869.86] I think it was pretty clear by the end of it that the whole thing was kind of lip service.
[6869.86 → 6871.70] Because it's not like we did that to make money.
[6871.78 → 6872.96] We made very little money.
[6873.04 → 6875.10] In fact, by the time you factor in the development cost.
[6875.20 → 6875.90] We probably lost money.
[6876.02 → 6879.38] I, I'm not going to say we lost money, but we, we did.
[6879.44 → 6880.64] We also got some RMA's.
[6880.86 → 6881.56] There was a bunch.
[6881.56 → 6882.84] There was a bunch of development time.
[6883.14 → 6883.32] Okay.
[6883.36 → 6888.88] We probably, let's say if you also account for opportunity costs of that development
[6888.88 → 6890.12] time, not just the hour.
[6890.32 → 6890.50] Sure.
[6890.66 → 6890.80] Yeah.
[6890.82 → 6893.84] Then we definitely lost money, but that's not losing money.
[6893.92 → 6895.42] That's losing opportunity.
[6895.66 → 6896.74] Not making other money.
[6896.78 → 6896.96] Yeah.
[6896.96 → 6899.58] So, you know, I, I try to be, words mean what they mean.
[6899.70 → 6901.92] I try to be careful with them for the most part.
[6902.14 → 6902.52] Yeah.
[6907.02 → 6907.38] What?
[6909.18 → 6909.58] Nothing.
[6909.70 → 6910.04] Go ahead.
[6910.16 → 6910.52] Say it.
[6910.68 → 6911.00] Nothing.
[6912.08 → 6914.58] Why don't we talk about our new CT scanner?
[6915.02 → 6915.24] Yeah.
[6915.32 → 6915.64] What?
[6916.06 → 6917.46] Is this cool or what?
[6917.54 → 6919.46] It's, I mean, the images from it are sick.
[6919.58 → 6922.52] Oh, this thing is so cool.
[6922.66 → 6924.72] Did anyone put any information about it?
[6924.76 → 6926.50] Did we even name them?
[6926.96 → 6927.12] Nope.
[6927.12 → 6928.00] Darn it, you guys.
[6928.24 → 6930.54] Uh, hold on a second.
[6931.92 → 6932.32] Ugh.
[6933.68 → 6934.16] Um.
[6940.94 → 6942.90] Elijah's asking, can I scan my head?
[6943.62 → 6944.06] No.
[6944.64 → 6946.50] It's x-rays, you f***ING.
[6946.50 → 6946.78] Definitely.
[6947.68 → 6948.94] I think we should try that.
[6950.68 → 6951.16] No.
[6951.38 → 6954.44] I mean, with the amount of times he's hit it, it's probably just empty.
[6954.74 → 6955.18] Fascinating.
[6956.96 → 6957.76] Okay.
[6958.30 → 6959.28] So, hold on.
[6959.58 → 6960.46] All skull.
[6960.64 → 6961.98] Just this endless void.
[6964.20 → 6966.16] Mom says it's my turn with the brain cell.
[6966.16 → 6966.60] Okay.
[6966.60 → 6966.72] Okay.
[6969.72 → 6972.02] So, these are the guys that we're working with.
[6972.02 → 6972.94] Uh, Lima Field.
[6973.22 → 6974.44] So, we got the Neptune.
[6974.64 → 6975.66] Well, it looks cool, too.
[6975.76 → 6976.52] CT scanner.
[6976.70 → 6977.00] You all.
[6977.10 → 6977.26] What?
[6977.54 → 6979.02] Looks super cool.
[6979.42 → 6987.48] Uh, basically, uh, what it does is it, um, at varying exposure times slash, I'm not sure
[6987.48 → 6991.02] if the energy level actually varies, but the exposure time definitely varies.
[6991.50 → 6998.46] Um, it moves around an object, blasts it with x-rays, and spits out an extremely high
[6998.46 → 7004.52] fidelity 3D view of whatever object you put inside it.
[7004.52 → 7013.50] So, I believe the one we have is the, uh, Neptune x-ray vision for engineers.
[7013.72 → 7013.88] Yeah.
[7014.28 → 7019.02] Um, from talking to Lucas from the lab, who it seems has spent most of the time with it
[7019.02 → 7023.66] so far, uh, the largest object we can do is about the size of a basketball.
[7023.66 → 7028.90] So, unfortunately, it's not big enough for us to do something like a laptop, but we could
[7028.90 → 7030.32] do something like a smartphone.
[7031.10 → 7031.50] Um.
[7031.74 → 7035.14] Do you have any issues with, like, magnetic stuff around it when it's going?
[7035.60 → 7038.10] Or is it because of the box, so it's not a problem?
[7038.34 → 7043.42] Apparently, the exposure outside the box is less than you would experience by quite a
[7043.42 → 7044.82] lot than just sitting on an airplane.
[7045.36 → 7045.84] Okay, yeah.
[7045.94 → 7046.08] Yeah.
[7046.14 → 7047.66] So, it's, it's no big deal.
[7048.36 → 7048.76] Um.
[7048.82 → 7050.66] Oh, but that's not the mag.
[7050.70 → 7051.38] Here we go.
[7051.38 → 7053.92] So, what you're saying is its Elijah head-sized.
[7053.94 → 7054.32] Seriously?
[7056.06 → 7056.86] No, Dan!
[7057.50 → 7058.72] Nobody is saying that.
[7059.10 → 7059.92] Elijah's saying that.
[7061.30 → 7062.66] If we, if we...
[7062.66 → 7063.22] Like I said.
[7066.64 → 7070.36] Okay, nobody who is allowed to make those kinds of decisions is saying that.
[7070.44 → 7070.56] There.
[7071.10 → 7075.68] Mike D says, I work at a university with a whole department dedicated to studying brain injuries.
[7075.86 → 7076.88] Send Elijah my way.
[7077.00 → 7078.76] Could we use that as a tax write-off?
[7080.92 → 7081.36] No.
[7081.68 → 7082.30] They could.
[7083.34 → 7083.70] No.
[7084.32 → 7085.86] That's not how any of this works.
[7085.94 → 7087.62] We'll hire a media consultant.
[7087.62 → 7088.88] What if we're doing a video of this?
[7089.50 → 7090.60] We'll have them make a video.
[7090.70 → 7091.40] It'd be advertising.
[7092.26 → 7093.02] I hate you guys so much.
[7093.02 → 7094.40] We're going to be in the green for once.
[7094.62 → 7096.38] We can afford new microscopes.
[7097.28 → 7097.64] Amazing.
[7100.36 → 7101.08] We're doing it.
[7101.38 → 7102.02] We're doing business.
[7102.58 → 7104.82] The funny thing is, you guys are Memling.
[7105.24 → 7108.60] A lot of other people in the comments are going to be Memling because they know how much
[7108.60 → 7110.96] I get triggered by this kind of tax write-off.
[7110.96 → 7113.14] But a significant number.
[7113.14 → 7119.12] After I did the spiel, a significant amount of the comments section is still people who
[7119.12 → 7122.24] completely do not.
[7122.36 → 7124.40] It's like they don't want to understand.
[7124.80 → 7132.52] One of the things is that I think you are operating above board, but a lot of people aren't.
[7132.52 → 7137.44] And there's this whole thing going on right now where the IRS was partially defunded in
[7137.44 → 7137.88] the States.
[7138.24 → 7139.28] We don't live in the States.
[7139.52 → 7141.48] But the IRS was partially defunded in the States.
[7141.52 → 7145.78] And apparently a bunch of people were getting away with improperly doing tons of tax write-offs.
[7146.46 → 7149.06] But maybe they're going after them now or something or whatever.
[7149.20 → 7149.70] I don't know.
[7149.92 → 7150.06] Sure.
[7150.36 → 7151.50] Let me put it this way.
[7151.56 → 7155.74] I am not a small enough fish that I could possibly hope to get away with that.
[7156.36 → 7161.06] Our companies have been audited, all of them, multiple times in the time we've been running
[7161.06 → 7163.06] them.
[7163.06 → 7170.10] If we had anything, even approaching the egregiousness of trying to write off a home renovation,
[7170.74 → 7178.82] I would get f***ed like six ways, sideways, every bad way.
[7179.90 → 7182.28] The CRA does not f*** around.
[7182.68 → 7182.80] Yeah.
[7182.84 → 7183.62] It's a little different.
[7184.36 → 7185.68] So it's a little different.
[7185.68 → 7192.32] Because I've heard stories from other people in the industry and other people doing business
[7192.32 → 7199.48] stuff in general that are pretty crazy in regard to how they deal with taxes and write-offs
[7199.48 → 7200.34] and all this other type of stuff.
[7201.90 → 7202.96] It's all Americans.
[7203.82 → 7204.98] In my experience.
[7205.42 → 7210.28] I think their whole tax code being so insanely complicated kind of works both ways.
[7210.28 → 7213.90] Because there's like no way to do it right so they can screw you over no matter what.
[7214.14 → 7215.88] But also, there's no way to do it right.
[7217.64 → 7221.32] So people are just going to do a lot of stuff wrong anyway.
[7222.10 → 7223.56] So like, I don't know.
[7224.00 → 7225.32] I think it's bad on both ends.
[7226.32 → 7227.08] Pretty much.
[7227.24 → 7228.68] But I mean, I don't know.
[7228.76 → 7229.84] Because I don't have to deal with them.
[7231.56 → 7232.74] Oh man, I'm so annoyed.
[7232.92 → 7234.10] Dan, yeah, confirmed.
[7234.10 → 7236.70] We have to use that one app.
[7238.02 → 7240.02] We cannot use a different one.
[7240.08 → 7241.28] And that's very, very annoying.
[7242.00 → 7242.40] Yeah.
[7242.86 → 7243.74] Luke, what?
[7244.30 → 7244.74] Seriously?
[7245.54 → 7246.46] This is new?
[7247.32 → 7247.98] I think so.
[7250.12 → 7251.92] Sorry, where did this whole...
[7251.92 → 7253.10] Can we deal with this on Monday?
[7253.54 → 7254.22] How did this conversation even start?
[7254.42 → 7257.64] Because I was logging into my work account before the show.
[7257.84 → 7261.22] And it told me I have one more warning before I must use this.
[7261.52 → 7262.78] And then I used up my one.
[7262.78 → 7263.78] Which work account?
[7264.10 → 7264.82] Well, this one.
[7267.12 → 7268.96] The maker of this tool.
[7269.94 → 7270.60] Yeah, yeah.
[7274.56 → 7275.00] Yeah.
[7275.28 → 7275.86] So this.
[7276.80 → 7277.30] So I'm...
[7277.30 → 7277.70] Can I type?
[7277.92 → 7278.26] Can we...
[7278.26 → 7278.46] Yeah.
[7278.60 → 7279.48] I mean, we'll talk about it.
[7279.52 → 7280.74] We can deal with this Monday, but...
[7280.74 → 7281.02] Okay.
[7281.36 → 7285.60] So is there no other option for the app for this?
[7286.48 → 7286.90] No.
[7287.42 → 7288.30] Well, that's stupid.
[7288.52 → 7288.78] Yeah.
[7289.32 → 7290.88] And I'm very unhappy about it.
[7290.88 → 7296.90] I have to have an entirely separate app just for this one stupid login.
[7299.04 → 7299.56] Okay.
[7299.56 → 7302.86] I hate app bloat.
[7303.86 → 7305.42] Don't like extra apps.
[7305.62 → 7307.20] I think I kind of like this, actually.
[7308.18 → 7308.62] Explain.
[7310.96 → 7313.52] I don't know if I can right now, but I think I kind of like this.
[7314.82 → 7315.82] I'm interested.
[7316.28 → 7317.06] We'll talk later.
[7317.06 → 7321.02] Well, I think you know which side of this battle I want to win.
[7321.90 → 7322.16] Right?
[7322.84 → 7325.94] And there are reasons why this one is currently winning.
[7326.22 → 7327.74] But I don't want that one to win.
[7327.84 → 7329.00] I want the other one to win.
[7330.42 → 7330.90] Yeah.
[7330.90 → 7335.58] So stuff like this is great for me because my team's losing.
[7336.38 → 7342.78] And after all that, I don't have access to the SharePoint share that Lucas sent to me.
[7343.32 → 7344.80] Why is it on SharePoint?
[7344.88 → 7345.90] I don't know.
[7346.02 → 7348.14] I'm just trying to click a link in the dock, Luke.
[7348.28 → 7350.46] I hate computers.
[7350.46 → 7353.36] It took me this long to click a link in the dock.
[7354.06 → 7355.50] He's supposed to be using Google Drive.
[7356.08 → 7356.48] Okay.
[7356.60 → 7357.78] Is somebody using SharePoint?
[7358.10 → 7358.36] Yeah.
[7358.50 → 7359.64] Do I have to break fingers?
[7360.08 → 7360.40] Yeah.
[7361.40 → 7362.26] Oh my God.
[7362.32 → 7364.46] Actually, like you should make a note for Monday.
[7364.72 → 7365.66] I don't even have a...
[7365.66 → 7366.50] I don't even have...
[7366.50 → 7370.34] There was a prompt to request access to it, and I'm not getting a prompt anymore.
[7370.86 → 7371.78] That's because it's SharePoint.
[7371.90 → 7373.06] I'm not even getting a prompt.
[7373.62 → 7375.38] I am so upset right now.
[7375.46 → 7380.38] I'm sending a scheduled message to this person, and it's just all capitals.
[7380.38 → 7381.86] I'm coming for your fingers.
[7381.96 → 7382.56] No, you can't.
[7382.68 → 7383.88] No, you can't do that.
[7385.10 → 7389.88] I will ask Ariana to tell me where they live and just go there after Sancho.
[7389.88 → 7392.22] You guys can't do that.
[7393.42 → 7395.58] I don't even think you can joke about that.
[7395.66 → 7397.78] I think the gas for that trip is a tax write-off.
[7397.82 → 7398.32] There you go.
[7398.38 → 7399.62] I'll use the company car.
[7400.44 → 7401.56] And then the overtime...
[7401.56 → 7404.90] Well, the thing is that you will have one less employee to pay.
[7405.02 → 7405.64] So I'm like...
[7405.64 → 7407.34] I'm like saving you money.
[7407.34 → 7408.20] It'll be two.
[7408.20 → 7409.52] Yeah, because I'll be in jail.
[7411.80 → 7413.44] Double tax write-off.
[7413.84 → 7415.82] That's not a tax write-off.
[7415.98 → 7419.90] Oh yeah, that's just being business savvy and saving you money.
[7420.42 → 7420.68] Yeah.
[7421.34 → 7423.20] Which might be a tax write-off.
[7423.94 → 7424.62] Okay.
[7424.76 → 7425.56] If you think about it.
[7425.84 → 7426.28] Anyway.
[7426.78 → 7432.52] I can't show you the scan of the mouse because it is in SharePoint and I don't have access to it.
[7432.52 → 7438.10] But this is the inside of that promotional D brand Rubik's Cube.
[7439.20 → 7441.08] How cool is that?
[7441.94 → 7448.04] So you're seeing like the magnets for aligning it or something like that.
[7448.04 → 7452.24] And then you're seeing the internal gear mechanism for rotating it around.
[7452.96 → 7454.46] Luke, Rubik's Cube?
[7455.08 → 7456.54] Oh yeah, that picture is sick.
[7457.04 → 7457.96] Really like that one.
[7457.96 → 7458.88] Super cool.
[7459.46 → 7460.26] Here we go.
[7460.34 → 7460.78] Here we go.
[7461.36 → 7465.22] Here's a Noctua Edition LTE screwdriver on an overnight.
[7465.40 → 7466.48] So this is a 12-hour scan.
[7466.58 → 7469.90] The longer you go, the more detail you can get.
[7470.44 → 7471.64] So here it is.
[7472.18 → 7473.10] Pretty sick.
[7473.18 → 7474.76] And there are things that we can refine.
[7474.88 → 7476.14] There are things that we can fine-tune.
[7476.72 → 7481.60] One of the things that we agreed to was that for the first three months,
[7482.08 → 7483.94] anything that we're going to publish in a video,
[7484.28 → 7487.22] we would send it to them to make sure that like everything was set correctly
[7487.22 → 7489.08] because this is a real tool.
[7489.22 → 7490.02] It's a professional tool.
[7490.84 → 7492.48] There are a lot of parameters that you can adjust.
[7492.54 → 7494.14] But oh my gosh, how cool is that?
[7494.84 → 7495.38] That's it.
[7495.42 → 7496.52] That's the ratchet mechanism.
[7496.94 → 7498.12] There's the bit storage.
[7498.82 → 7499.86] That's pretty sweet.
[7500.24 → 7501.50] Absolutely love it.
[7502.72 → 7503.52] Oh my God.
[7503.52 → 7508.06] I mean, dang it.
[7510.40 → 7510.88] Maybe.
[7511.32 → 7511.70] Hold on.
[7511.80 → 7512.84] I really want to show you guys.
[7514.54 → 7515.02] Okay.
[7515.60 → 7518.48] I hate this, but I'm downloading a file from Teams.
[7518.86 → 7521.24] Then I'm going to have to upload it to Drive.
[7521.46 → 7526.34] Then I'm going to have to open it on there because I'm not logged into Teams on this
[7526.34 → 7528.60] for what are probably fairly obvious reasons.
[7528.80 → 7530.38] What if you just have them send it to that email?
[7530.38 → 7535.76] At this point, I can email it to myself faster than I can have someone else send me the stupid
[7535.76 → 7536.06] thing.
[7536.16 → 7537.44] So I'm just going to do it myself.
[7537.66 → 7538.14] Sounds good.
[7539.30 → 7539.74] Okay.
[7540.06 → 7540.60] Hold on.
[7540.72 → 7541.84] Now I got a reply.
[7542.04 → 7544.06] I love coordinating stuff like this.
[7544.18 → 7545.72] I'm like, yes, thanks.
[7546.34 → 7546.72] Okay.
[7548.64 → 7550.30] Anyway, that's the internals.
[7550.60 → 7554.58] Oh, here's a metal 3D printed key cap scanned for 80 minutes.
[7554.90 → 7555.64] Pretty cool as well.
[7555.64 → 7558.30] Guys, how freaking cool is this?
[7558.74 → 7562.20] And it's apparently super accurate.
[7562.80 → 7564.20] Like super accurate.
[7564.58 → 7566.90] Like within 0.1 something's.
[7566.92 → 7568.78] I can't remember what they are, but they're small.
[7570.68 → 7572.16] Really excited about this, man.
[7572.22 → 7574.06] The options are endless.
[7574.62 → 7577.64] And what would you guys like to see us use it for?
[7577.72 → 7578.24] Oh my God.
[7578.24 → 7580.06] We're not doing tax write-off shirts.
[7580.34 → 7583.66] Could you tax write-off the shirt?
[7584.80 → 7587.82] What if you hired a consultant to do the design?
[7591.90 → 7594.82] I mean, yeah, we can write that off.
[7596.42 → 7597.24] Very wise.
[7598.64 → 7599.24] But...
[7599.24 → 7600.54] We will help you business.
[7605.30 → 7607.38] We're going to be a business factory.
[7607.98 → 7609.88] Together we will become a real company.
[7610.66 → 7612.42] Is this what my mom always says?
[7612.54 → 7613.42] Get a real job?
[7613.56 → 7614.46] Can we have...
[7614.46 → 7615.58] Is this a real job now?
[7615.80 → 7618.12] Can we talk about the cool CT scanner now?
[7619.38 → 7619.82] Okay.
[7620.30 → 7624.70] Can we talk about the cool Afield CT scanner that is really cool?
[7624.82 → 7626.08] What's your favourite thing you scanned?
[7626.08 → 7626.94] That they're letting us use?
[7627.40 → 7627.90] That what?
[7628.14 → 7629.16] What's your favourite thing you scanned?
[7630.00 → 7630.36] Um.
[7630.58 → 7632.92] Like, is the Rubik's Cube your favourite one so far?
[7632.98 → 7633.42] Well, I don't know.
[7633.46 → 7635.18] It might be the mouse, but I haven't seen it yet.
[7635.36 → 7636.52] Did you write off the Rubik's Cube?
[7637.98 → 7638.34] No.
[7638.80 → 7639.28] That's...
[7639.28 → 7641.52] What are you even talking about?
[7641.54 → 7644.16] You're not even trying to make it kind of make sense anymore.
[7644.58 → 7645.10] What do you mean?
[7645.14 → 7646.04] It's a prop.
[7646.26 → 7646.72] It's probably...
[7646.72 → 7649.38] It was probably on one of the shelves in one of the backgrounds of one of the videos.
[7649.54 → 7652.32] I'm suspecting someone didn't bring the Rubik's Cube from home.
[7652.80 → 7653.06] Look.
[7653.66 → 7655.12] I'm going to be honest with you here.
[7656.62 → 7657.86] The Rubik's Cube...
[7657.86 → 7659.54] I didn't pay for it at all.
[7659.66 → 7661.54] Brand sent it, and it doesn't even...
[7662.12 → 7663.98] No offence, Brand, but it's worthless.
[7665.02 → 7666.90] I don't think we declared it.
[7666.96 → 7668.08] I don't even know where it is.
[7668.58 → 7669.98] I don't care.
[7670.42 → 7672.28] I don't care about that Rubik's Cube.
[7672.66 → 7675.52] I don't bother to build the company when we use my house as a location.
[7675.78 → 7676.32] It's not...
[7676.32 → 7676.80] It doesn't...
[7676.80 → 7678.30] It doesn't register, Luke.
[7678.54 → 7678.72] Hmm.
[7678.72 → 7681.16] I don't care about the Rubik's Cube.
[7681.16 → 7681.60] Hmm.
[7683.42 → 7684.68] Hate you guys so much.
[7684.92 → 7685.54] Screwdriver, though?
[7687.94 → 7689.22] Screwdriver looks really cool.
[7689.42 → 7690.20] It does, actually.
[7690.54 → 7691.16] The whatever...
[7691.86 → 7694.24] 12-hour scan one is pretty wicked.
[7694.44 → 7694.64] Yeah.
[7695.66 → 7696.10] Okay.
[7696.20 → 7699.82] How it picked up the knurling and stuff is pretty cool.
[7700.22 → 7700.52] Okay.
[7700.60 → 7701.20] Here it is.
[7701.28 → 7703.76] Here's mouse1.mp4, finally.
[7703.76 → 7706.12] Flipping.
[7706.58 → 7707.18] So, wait.
[7707.22 → 7708.48] What's happening on the right, right now?
[7708.92 → 7709.60] Not sure.
[7710.30 → 7711.30] Let me move you guys.
[7711.46 → 7714.18] Sounds like something a big nerd would know.
[7715.20 → 7716.44] Oh, it's moving.
[7716.44 → 7717.52] Is it like building it?
[7717.62 → 7717.82] Yeah.
[7717.92 → 7719.44] It's like going through it.
[7720.18 → 7723.70] So, the left is like the final image and the right is...
[7723.70 → 7724.28] I think so.
[7724.52 → 7725.80] How it's like building the...
[7725.80 → 7726.82] Yeah, the slices.
[7727.26 → 7727.50] Yeah.
[7728.38 → 7729.20] Freaking cool.
[7729.32 → 7730.14] That's pretty wild.
[7730.64 → 7731.50] Freaking cool.
[7731.94 → 7732.60] Where are the...
[7732.60 → 7732.88] Okay.
[7732.88 → 7734.00] I see at the bottom there.
[7734.30 → 7734.68] That makes sense.
[7734.68 → 7735.02] So, we can...
[7735.02 → 7740.28] Like, we can see the internal trace layout of a PCB, potentially.
[7740.62 → 7745.82] Not on anything super complex, in all likelihood, but on something relatively simple, like a mouse.
[7745.88 → 7746.04] Yeah.
[7747.00 → 7747.48] So...
[7747.48 → 7748.52] The switches are so cool.
[7750.14 → 7750.54] Small.
[7751.62 → 7752.42] Small boys.
[7754.42 → 7756.44] Or as I call them, line of size boys.
[7757.94 → 7758.30] Okay.
[7758.36 → 7759.50] What are we supposed to be talking about now?
[7760.34 → 7760.74] Samsung.
[7760.74 → 7762.48] Samsung.
[7763.08 → 7763.44] Samsung.
[7763.44 → 7763.56] Samsung.
[7763.56 → 7763.82] Samsung.
[7764.40 → 7764.80] Okay.
[7765.08 → 7770.12] They are doing some of the coolest display development right now.
[7770.60 → 7773.20] Quantum Dot OLED technology is amazing.
[7773.42 → 7777.94] We did a sponsored video for them around the time of CES for Samsung Display, which, by the
[7777.94 → 7780.56] way, is not the same thing as Samsung Electronics.
[7781.00 → 7782.54] So, we worked with Samsung Display.
[7782.54 → 7784.80] We hung out with those guys a little bit at CES.
[7784.92 → 7785.64] I shouldn't say hung out.
[7785.76 → 7786.58] We went to their booth.
[7786.82 → 7788.22] We went to their booth at CES.
[7789.50 → 7791.36] I genuinely...
[7791.36 → 7794.64] Like, I would have been happy to make that video without a sponsorship check.
[7794.72 → 7795.28] I don't even care.
[7795.28 → 7796.16] I love this tech.
[7796.22 → 7796.96] It's so cool.
[7797.18 → 7797.62] QD OLED.
[7797.86 → 7798.28] Amazing.
[7798.96 → 7799.92] Samsung Electronics.
[7800.80 → 7801.72] What are you doing, bud?
[7802.64 → 7806.26] They announced their upcoming OLED TV lineup.
[7806.26 → 7813.88] But for unknown reasons, the company has apparently chosen not to state whether a given television
[7813.88 → 7823.14] uses a Quantum Dot OLED panel, the kind that Samsung Display makes, or a W OLED panel, the
[7823.14 → 7825.58] kind that LG Display makes.
[7825.58 → 7825.84] OLED.
[7826.68 → 7834.30] While all of Samsung's high-end S95C TVs will be QD OLED, its mid-range S90D series will
[7834.30 → 7840.18] apparently be sometimes QD OLED and sometimes W OLED.
[7841.62 → 7849.50] Samsung has previously heavily advocated for Quantum Dots, both for colour purity and for avoiding
[7849.50 → 7854.32] burn-in, which appear to be very legitimate advantages of their technology.
[7855.66 → 7861.46] But according to Korean media outlet Wheeled, Samsung has decided not to explicitly advertise
[7861.46 → 7867.66] their TVs as QD OLED due to a request from LG Display not to position white OLED as inferior
[7867.66 → 7868.66] to QD OLED.
[7869.30 → 7871.74] What the actual f*** is going on?
[7871.74 → 7883.68] I put this in as a topic because I get so flipping upset every time a brand obfuscates
[7883.68 → 7888.20] the underlying technology of what's being used with a deceptive naming scheme.
[7888.42 → 7890.76] And we've seen this time and time again.
[7891.26 → 7891.74] Remember when, um...
[7893.02 → 7896.74] Okay, very recently, AMD...
[7896.74 → 7898.42] Not very recently.
[7898.52 → 7906.94] On an ongoing basis, AMD has created a different, um, numbering scheme for their mobile processors
[7906.94 → 7913.80] compared to their desktop processors so that you can't compare across generations and know
[7913.80 → 7915.88] what exact, um...
[7915.88 → 7916.96] Sorry, excuse me.
[7916.96 → 7923.44] So you can't look at both of them and know what generation of Zen architecture they're using
[7923.44 → 7930.32] even though traditionally the model number has gone up to correspond with a move from Zen
[7930.32 → 7932.56] to Zen Plus to Zen 2 to Zen 3 to Zen 4.
[7934.36 → 7937.20] And I'm trying to think of some other perfect examples of this.
[7937.30 → 7943.24] I mean, NVIDIA's had some GPUs where you might get one architecture, you might get another one,
[7943.24 → 7947.40] and the performance characteristics can be different across them.
[7947.40 → 7951.60] Uh, we've seen from, um...
[7951.60 → 7953.86] Man, I'm trying to think now.
[7953.92 → 7958.94] I'm pretty sure Intel has pulled this nonsense at some point or another where at the low end
[7958.94 → 7964.14] they were using, uh, like a previous architecture even though it had the same, as, family name,
[7964.18 → 7967.00] uh, in the branding, like the same generational branding.
[7967.00 → 7969.00] And I just...
[7969.00 → 7973.00] It drives me absolutely crazy because...
[7973.00 → 7974.76] I don't have to...
[7974.76 → 7976.44] Like, I don't imagine, right?
[7976.48 → 7980.24] I don't imagine for a second that when I buy the high-end product,
[7980.24 → 7982.70] I'm getting exactly the same thing as the high end one.
[7983.04 → 7987.78] I mean, sure, if I buy the, you know, whatever 90 instead of the 95,
[7988.24 → 7989.90] I might be getting lower end processing.
[7990.04 → 7992.82] I might not be getting as many, uh, HDMI inputs.
[7993.16 → 7998.14] Uh, it might not be available with the same degree of anti-glare coding technology or whatever.
[7998.48 → 8000.76] But if I'm buying this generation of product,
[8000.76 → 8004.20] my expectation is that I'm getting the high-end version of that,
[8004.28 → 8006.90] not that I'm getting a completely f***ING different thing.
[8007.10 → 8010.18] And I don't think that that's an unfair expectation.
[8010.18 → 8013.86] I think that that should be a baseline expectation.
[8018.28 → 8018.68] Yeah.
[8018.68 → 8019.92] And that's all I have to say about that.
[8020.06 → 8020.22] Yeah.
[8020.88 → 8023.46] Discussion question is if customers are getting an equally good product,
[8023.46 → 8026.30] does it matter that they don't know or understand the difference between two products
[8026.30 → 8027.54] that are being sold as the same thing?
[8027.68 → 8028.86] But that's the thing.
[8028.86 → 8029.42] Mm-hmm.
[8029.42 → 8032.44] They are getting and also good product.
[8033.02 → 8035.14] W OLED has advantages.
[8035.52 → 8039.20] When we're talking pure brightness, okay,
[8039.56 → 8044.96] W OLED can achieve higher highs, especially on white.
[8045.38 → 8046.54] And you know what?
[8046.58 → 8048.10] A lot of your specular highlights,
[8048.44 → 8051.78] a lot of your pinpoint stars or, you know, whatever,
[8051.88 → 8055.50] a lot of the things that are really bright in the scene happen to be white.
[8055.50 → 8057.72] And so they can achieve really...
[8057.72 → 8060.02] Something like fire, like the really bright points of it might be white.
[8060.12 → 8063.26] They can achieve really amazing performance in HDR,
[8063.40 → 8066.42] which is how we're evaluating the latest generation of displays,
[8066.42 → 8068.98] because they're all going to do a great job of SDR anyway.
[8069.12 → 8070.76] So we want to see how well they do in HDR.
[8070.76 → 8075.42] Also, LG's own TVs, so again, LG display, LG electronics, not the same thing,
[8075.62 → 8079.68] but LG electronics displays, as we saw when we checked out that Flanders Scientific display,
[8080.24 → 8086.38] can do a great job, even though they have, you know, inferior panel technology
[8086.38 → 8088.32] when it comes to colour brightness,
[8088.32 → 8090.50] because that's the thing that QD OLED does so well,
[8090.88 → 8095.38] is when you're talking about the brightest possible representation of a pure colour,
[8095.90 → 8098.52] QD OLED is superior to W OLED,
[8098.60 → 8101.94] because it's not washed out by that white subpixel
[8101.94 → 8104.20] when it's trying to achieve that level of brightness.
[8105.06 → 8109.64] Red is just the red subpixel going full more, baby!
[8110.10 → 8113.02] Not red with some, a little bit of white in there.
[8113.16 → 8114.54] Let me just sneak a little bit of white in there.
[8114.56 → 8115.24] Trying to mix things.
[8115.24 → 8118.80] And so it's not about superior or inferior even necessarily,
[8118.80 → 8120.80] it's about understanding what the fuck I'm buying.
[8121.38 → 8124.82] And my understanding when I was buying a Samsung TV was I was getting,
[8125.04 → 8126.52] if it was OLED, I was getting QD OLED.
[8126.88 → 8128.86] And Samsung has marketed it really heavily,
[8129.00 → 8131.18] for them to do this about face,
[8131.54 → 8133.20] so that they can, you know,
[8133.46 → 8137.12] not make their HOLED panel-based TVs look too bad,
[8137.48 → 8138.50] is really frustrating.
[8138.64 → 8141.42] Like, by all means, have HOLED panels,
[8141.42 → 8143.30] but just tell me that's what it is.
[8143.30 → 8145.42] And marketed as such,
[8145.54 → 8147.66] because they're not the same thing.
[8148.86 → 8150.26] Creating confusion.
[8150.96 → 8155.38] So that, it basically amounts to creating confusion.
[8155.70 → 8156.80] It's intentional.
[8157.22 → 8159.56] It's not like this is accidental, Sophie-doodle.
[8159.74 → 8161.74] Like, at this point, why did you even make White OLED?
[8162.64 → 8165.98] Well, because LG display,
[8166.42 → 8168.28] if they stop running the fabs,
[8168.96 → 8170.98] is basically, like, la-hooped.
[8170.98 → 8173.28] And so, if I had to guess,
[8173.98 → 8178.86] I would say it's because LG display needs to sell panels.
[8179.90 → 8182.24] Samsung Electronics moves a lot of TVs.
[8182.90 → 8186.62] And so, they've done a deal to move LG panels.
[8187.16 → 8189.30] And as part of that business arrangement,
[8189.52 → 8190.68] this kind of makes sense.
[8190.76 → 8193.10] There's a combination of what's being reported here,
[8193.22 → 8195.16] which is that LG has asked,
[8195.56 → 8197.74] hey, respectfully, if you're going to buy our product,
[8197.74 → 8201.46] don't take a big f***ING dump on it in your marketing, right?
[8201.78 → 8203.14] So, part of it is that.
[8203.32 → 8205.04] And another part of it is that,
[8205.12 → 8207.42] from Samsung Electronics' standpoint,
[8207.58 → 8208.38] they're sitting here going,
[8208.56 → 8212.76] hmm, well, if we just market everything OLED as OLED,
[8213.22 → 8214.90] and we're getting a deal from, uh,
[8215.96 → 8217.80] life's desperate over there,
[8217.80 → 8224.16] hey, LG has spent the last eight years hyping OLED,
[8225.02 → 8228.44] why don't we just stop talking about the differences
[8228.44 → 8229.82] in the different kinds of OLED,
[8230.08 → 8232.48] and we can take these discount OLED panels,
[8233.14 → 8235.76] position them, you know, right alongside ours,
[8236.22 → 8237.94] charge a premium price for the display,
[8238.08 → 8239.50] and hey, no one's the wiser.
[8239.50 → 8242.50] So, there's, so Samsung Electronics
[8242.50 → 8244.34] has their own incentive
[8244.34 → 8248.34] for not positioning QD OLED
[8248.34 → 8250.66] as that much better than W OLED,
[8250.82 → 8252.44] because you've got to understand
[8252.44 → 8253.86] Samsung Display, Samsung Electronics,
[8254.00 → 8255.50] yes, they are definitely related,
[8256.20 → 8257.54] and they definitely, you know,
[8257.98 → 8259.30] co-benefit each other,
[8259.72 → 8262.54] but Samsung Electronics has to buy panels
[8262.54 → 8263.52] from Samsung Display,
[8263.88 → 8265.54] and it's in their best interest
[8265.54 → 8267.60] to take as much of the margin
[8267.60 → 8268.86] of that finished product
[8268.86 → 8270.18] away from Samsung Display
[8270.18 → 8271.52] and into Samsung Electronics
[8271.52 → 8273.34] because that makes them look good,
[8273.64 → 8275.20] and they don't ultimately care
[8275.20 → 8275.86] nearly as much
[8275.86 → 8277.44] about how Samsung Display looks,
[8277.60 → 8280.12] so if they can use LG Display
[8280.12 → 8282.00] to put pressure on Samsung Display
[8282.00 → 8283.20] so that they can get better deals
[8283.20 → 8283.70] across the board,
[8283.74 → 8284.50] they're going to do that,
[8284.82 → 8286.04] regardless of whether LG,
[8286.56 → 8287.34] you know, pretty please,
[8287.46 → 8289.74] asks them not to make W OLED look bad.
[8290.28 → 8292.34] So, there's a whole-complicated dynamic
[8292.34 → 8292.92] at play here,
[8292.96 → 8294.04] but at the end of the day,
[8294.16 → 8295.56] it's all about making money,
[8295.56 → 8298.06] and none of it is about helping consumers
[8298.06 → 8299.52] understand what the f**k they're buying,
[8299.74 → 8301.12] and that's what I don't like.
[8304.28 → 8304.68] There.
[8306.14 → 8307.74] And none of this is a tax write-off.
[8307.92 → 8308.20] Stop.
[8309.06 → 8311.38] Although there are plenty of tax incentives
[8311.38 → 8312.24] and tax write-offs
[8312.24 → 8313.86] in the operation of their businesses,
[8314.04 → 8314.50] I'm sure.
[8314.56 → 8315.66] I'm sure lots, yeah.
[8315.66 → 8317.66] I mean, especially in South Korea.
[8318.12 → 8318.20] Yeah.
[8318.26 → 8320.22] Like, the whole, you know,
[8320.30 → 8322.58] the government and the big companies things.
[8323.40 → 8324.04] Well, it's something.
[8324.52 → 8325.10] It sure is.
[8326.00 → 8326.86] Speaking of something,
[8327.02 → 8328.16] Microsoft suddenly drops
[8328.16 → 8330.10] Windows 11's Android app support.
[8330.18 → 8331.16] Yeah, how about that?
[8331.18 → 8331.64] On March 5th,
[8331.68 → 8333.28] Microsoft unexpectedly announced
[8333.28 → 8334.10] that next year,
[8334.16 → 8335.42] it would be ending support
[8335.42 → 8337.96] of the Windows subsystem for Android,
[8338.26 → 8339.60] which allows Android apps
[8339.60 → 8340.98] to be used on Windows 11.
[8341.20 → 8342.32] The next day,
[8342.56 → 8343.40] the Windows subsystem
[8343.40 → 8345.16] was no longer available for download.
[8345.56 → 8347.52] The feature debuted in 2022,
[8348.08 → 8349.28] but it always lacked
[8349.28 → 8351.18] formal access to the Google Play Store,
[8351.28 → 8352.98] which was the whole issue,
[8353.12 → 8353.74] to be clear,
[8353.74 → 8354.84] meaning that users
[8354.84 → 8356.22] typically relied
[8356.22 → 8358.28] on the Amazon app store.
[8358.82 → 8359.52] While Microsoft
[8359.52 → 8360.34] has not stated
[8360.34 → 8361.44] the reason for the decision,
[8361.70 → 8362.62] it's broadly expected
[8362.62 → 8363.44] to be a result
[8363.44 → 8364.82] of low usage levels,
[8364.94 → 8365.68] particularly due
[8365.68 → 8366.20] to Microsoft
[8366.20 → 8367.32] no longer producing
[8367.32 → 8369.28] consumer-focused tablets.
[8369.74 → 8370.36] Discussion question,
[8370.42 → 8371.06] is Microsoft right
[8371.06 → 8371.76] to drop this feature,
[8371.82 → 8372.44] or should they simply
[8372.44 → 8373.08] have invested
[8373.08 → 8374.94] more into making it popular?
[8374.94 → 8376.70] I have an alternative
[8376.70 → 8377.96] weird theory,
[8378.28 → 8379.26] which is that they might
[8379.26 → 8379.90] be trying to get
[8379.90 → 8382.06] their own Android app store going,
[8382.22 → 8382.78] but actually,
[8382.86 → 8383.54] now that I think about it,
[8383.56 → 8384.30] that's a bad theory,
[8384.40 → 8385.18] so I take it back.
[8386.24 → 8388.02] I think it's just low usage.
[8389.56 → 8390.36] Supporting features
[8390.36 → 8391.28] that no one sucked,
[8391.48 → 8392.18] or no one uses,
[8392.60 → 8392.92] sucks.
[8393.54 → 8394.90] You have devs
[8394.90 → 8395.96] working on this thing,
[8396.04 → 8397.18] and a lot of developers
[8397.18 → 8398.10] want to work on something
[8398.10 → 8399.28] that people actually use,
[8399.28 → 8401.36] so you might have
[8401.36 → 8403.24] a literal morale issue
[8403.24 → 8404.48] if you get people
[8404.48 → 8405.46] to focus on
[8405.46 → 8408.42] maintaining this thing
[8408.42 → 8409.32] that people don't
[8409.32 → 8410.54] utilize anyway,
[8410.76 → 8413.16] and that sucks,
[8413.36 → 8414.02] and then just like,
[8414.08 → 8414.74] why are you wasting
[8414.74 → 8415.50] your time supporting
[8415.50 → 8416.38] this thing that is
[8416.38 → 8417.48] mostly supporting
[8417.48 → 8419.00] Amazon anyway,
[8419.46 → 8421.00] and no one's using?
[8422.22 → 8423.24] I just couldn't find
[8423.24 → 8424.20] a real reason to use it.
[8424.46 → 8425.26] We wanted to make
[8425.26 → 8426.02] a video about it.
[8426.16 → 8427.40] I was either earlier this year
[8427.40 → 8428.80] or sometime last year.
[8428.80 → 8429.72] If it had access
[8429.72 → 8430.70] to the Google Play story,
[8430.74 → 8431.32] it would be sick.
[8432.24 → 8433.76] But it shouldn't matter anyway
[8433.76 → 8434.66] because couldn't you
[8434.66 → 8435.90] just use an APK anyway?
[8438.66 → 8439.68] Not everything has
[8439.68 → 8440.90] those available.
[8442.10 → 8442.98] Every time I've looked
[8442.98 → 8443.28] for one,
[8443.32 → 8444.18] I've been able to find one,
[8444.48 → 8445.80] but I'm not...
[8446.34 → 8446.88] Are you sure?
[8446.98 → 8447.38] It's not something
[8447.38 → 8448.04] I've done often.
[8448.52 → 8449.30] Yeah, there's just like
[8449.30 → 8451.18] APK repository sites,
[8451.38 → 8452.46] and some of them
[8452.46 → 8453.12] seem real,
[8453.18 → 8454.76] but not advice.
[8455.20 → 8456.28] Some of them have seemed
[8456.28 → 8457.22] reasonably trustworthy,
[8457.22 → 8458.60] and I've downloaded things
[8458.60 → 8458.94] from them
[8458.94 → 8460.74] and not had any problems.
[8461.16 → 8462.14] Yeah, I don't know
[8462.14 → 8462.92] if most people
[8462.92 → 8463.74] want to do that, though.
[8463.88 → 8465.16] Like, I think your installation base
[8465.16 → 8465.88] of people doing that
[8465.88 → 8466.60] can be really low.
[8466.82 → 8467.48] Yeah, that's fair.
[8471.48 → 8471.84] Yeah.
[8471.96 → 8473.52] I just couldn't find...
[8473.52 → 8474.62] I couldn't find any reason
[8474.62 → 8475.28] to use it
[8475.28 → 8476.52] compared to apps
[8476.52 → 8477.82] that are readily available
[8477.82 → 8478.86] on Windows already.
[8478.98 → 8479.56] Or Phone Link.
[8480.64 → 8481.62] Yeah, that too.
[8482.38 → 8482.90] Someone mentioned
[8482.90 → 8483.46] that in Flow play chat.
[8483.50 → 8484.32] I didn't think about it myself,
[8484.44 → 8485.50] but it's a good argument.
[8485.50 → 8486.24] I just...
[8486.24 → 8486.86] I don't know anyone
[8486.86 → 8487.38] that uses it.
[8487.46 → 8488.62] If it had access
[8488.62 → 8489.40] to the Google Play Store,
[8489.48 → 8490.58] I would probably use it.
[8492.22 → 8493.86] But I don't want
[8493.86 → 8494.74] to use the Amazon Store.
[8494.90 → 8495.40] That's a whole
[8495.40 → 8496.34] different rabbit hole, though.
[8497.30 → 8498.34] Speaking of things
[8498.34 → 8499.22] being disabled,
[8499.62 → 8500.88] ROK disables TVs
[8500.88 → 8501.96] until users accept
[8501.96 → 8502.64] new terms
[8502.64 → 8504.42] involving forced arbitration.
[8504.90 → 8505.68] And worse.
[8506.00 → 8506.96] What the heck?
[8506.96 → 8508.74] This week,
[8508.80 → 8509.80] many users found themselves
[8509.80 → 8510.80] unable to access
[8510.80 → 8511.76] their ROK TVs
[8511.76 → 8512.74] unless they accepted
[8512.74 → 8515.54] new dispute resolution terms.
[8516.02 → 8516.68] ROK's terms
[8516.68 → 8518.26] have had a forced
[8518.26 → 8519.18] arbitration clause
[8519.18 → 8520.16] for some time,
[8520.24 → 8520.76] but the company
[8520.76 → 8521.86] quietly changed
[8521.86 → 8522.44] its terms
[8522.44 → 8524.48] as of February 20th
[8524.48 → 8525.14] to require
[8525.14 → 8526.22] a further step
[8526.22 → 8527.24] of informal
[8527.24 → 8528.24] dispute resolution
[8528.24 → 8529.12] where anyone
[8529.12 → 8530.52] with a legal complaint
[8530.52 → 8531.68] must first call
[8531.68 → 8532.96] and discuss the issue
[8532.96 → 8534.64] with ROK's lawyers
[8534.64 → 8536.38] even before seeking
[8536.38 → 8537.86] formal arbitration.
[8538.82 → 8539.64] Users will likely
[8539.64 → 8540.76] only have a narrow
[8540.76 → 8541.58] window of time
[8541.58 → 8542.22] to opt out
[8542.22 → 8543.02] of the new terms
[8543.02 → 8544.58] which ROK requires
[8544.58 → 8545.64] to be sent to them
[8545.64 → 8547.60] via snail mail.
[8551.46 → 8552.10] Huh.
[8554.06 → 8555.12] Discussion question is
[8555.12 → 8556.04] how much does
[8556.04 → 8557.44] intentional inconvenience
[8557.44 → 8558.02] prevent people
[8558.02 → 8558.70] from exercising
[8558.70 → 8559.12] their rights?
[8559.52 → 8560.46] How can you
[8560.46 → 8562.18] disable the TV?
[8562.66 → 8563.40] In my opinion,
[8563.40 → 8565.86] this is just
[8565.86 → 8567.24] waiting for a challenge.
[8567.58 → 8568.16] This is just
[8568.16 → 8569.28] waiting for a class action.
[8569.28 → 8570.02] I hope they get
[8570.02 → 8570.88] dunked on.
[8571.20 → 8573.00] This is crazy.
[8573.18 → 8573.90] They're basically
[8573.90 → 8575.94] going up
[8575.94 → 8579.40] at a baseball game.
[8580.12 → 8580.30] You know?
[8580.64 → 8581.70] They're in the crowd.
[8582.74 → 8583.60] They're pulling
[8583.60 → 8584.46] down their trousers.
[8585.32 → 8585.56] You know?
[8585.72 → 8586.38] They're calling
[8586.38 → 8587.80] the pitcher's name.
[8588.20 → 8589.08] And they're pulling
[8589.08 → 8589.68] down their pants.
[8589.78 → 8590.30] They're turning around.
[8590.40 → 8590.54] They're going,
[8590.62 → 8591.24] take a shot.
[8591.92 → 8592.74] Come on.
[8593.40 → 8595.42] I think they're
[8595.42 → 8595.78] going to get
[8595.78 → 8596.30] a hundred mile
[8596.30 → 8596.98] an hour fastball
[8596.98 → 8597.46] up the butt.
[8601.52 → 8602.28] Where is that
[8602.28 → 8602.70] from?
[8602.76 → 8603.28] Is that from
[8603.28 → 8603.60] something?
[8603.70 → 8604.04] Do you just
[8604.04 → 8604.60] make that up?
[8604.90 → 8605.34] I mean,
[8605.92 → 8607.58] it's from,
[8607.74 → 8608.04] you know,
[8608.12 → 8608.48] baseball.
[8610.48 → 8610.98] I'm sure
[8610.98 → 8611.50] someone's pulled
[8611.50 → 8612.02] down their pants
[8612.02 → 8612.72] at a baseball game
[8612.72 → 8613.06] once.
[8614.98 → 8616.08] Do you just think
[8616.08 → 8616.52] of these things
[8616.52 → 8617.00] while you go get
[8617.00 → 8617.16] snacks?
[8617.36 → 8617.54] Look,
[8617.60 → 8618.54] a bird got killed
[8618.54 → 8619.38] by Randy Johnson.
[8619.52 → 8620.06] There's no way
[8620.06 → 8620.62] no one's ever
[8620.62 → 8621.20] pulled down their
[8621.20 → 8622.22] pants at a baseball game.
[8622.22 → 8622.48] All those things
[8622.48 → 8623.04] being related
[8623.04 → 8623.68] is amazing.
[8623.82 → 8624.24] No,
[8624.34 → 8624.90] I just mean
[8624.90 → 8625.64] that the odds
[8625.64 → 8626.58] are.
[8626.76 → 8627.20] I love that.
[8628.78 → 8629.50] You know,
[8629.76 → 8632.02] planes kill birds
[8632.02 → 8632.62] all the time.
[8633.36 → 8633.62] Yeah.
[8633.70 → 8634.40] There's probably
[8634.40 → 8635.26] someone who has
[8635.26 → 8635.98] pants themselves
[8635.98 → 8636.32] in the middle
[8636.32 → 8636.64] of an aisle
[8636.64 → 8637.06] on a plane.
[8637.94 → 8638.36] It's probably
[8638.36 → 8638.66] happened.
[8638.74 → 8638.88] Yeah,
[8638.92 → 8639.26] exactly.
[8639.48 → 8639.70] Yeah,
[8639.92 → 8641.46] it totally makes
[8641.46 → 8641.68] sense.
[8641.82 → 8642.46] You've seen that
[8642.46 → 8643.12] clip of Randy
[8643.12 → 8643.98] Johnson hitting
[8643.98 → 8644.34] the bird,
[8644.42 → 8644.50] right?
[8644.54 → 8644.84] It's kind of
[8644.84 → 8645.16] crazy.
[8645.40 → 8645.72] Incredible.
[8645.84 → 8646.12] I thought it
[8646.12 → 8646.58] was fake.
[8647.26 → 8648.10] Like for years.
[8648.30 → 8648.94] Oh no,
[8649.00 → 8649.74] that like actually
[8649.74 → 8650.08] happened.
[8650.16 → 8651.42] That's unbelievable.
[8651.42 → 8652.06] Pretty wild.
[8654.68 → 8655.54] There is baseball
[8655.54 → 8655.94] in Canada.
[8656.06 → 8656.48] It just sucks.
[8657.04 → 8657.36] It's called
[8657.36 → 8658.28] basketball up here.
[8658.56 → 8658.88] It's not,
[8659.04 → 8659.80] stop it.
[8660.34 → 8660.54] Sorry,
[8660.66 → 8661.08] basketball?
[8661.08 → 8662.34] Man,
[8664.64 → 8665.18] that's the kind
[8665.18 → 8665.80] of movie that I
[8665.80 → 8666.54] would not want to
[8666.54 → 8667.14] go back and
[8667.14 → 8668.46] rewatch as not,
[8668.56 → 8669.68] you know,
[8669.72 → 8670.42] 14-year-old.
[8670.56 → 8670.88] Yeah,
[8671.14 → 8672.50] it's probably
[8672.50 → 8672.98] terrible.
[8672.98 → 8673.84] Probably doesn't
[8673.84 → 8674.36] hold up that
[8674.36 → 8674.62] well.
[8674.88 → 8675.10] Yeah.
[8675.92 → 8677.84] I remember it
[8677.84 → 8678.44] fondly,
[8678.60 → 8678.76] but.
[8679.02 → 8679.26] Me too.
[8679.72 → 8679.94] And.
[8681.26 → 8681.90] Everything I
[8681.90 → 8682.32] remember.
[8682.46 → 8683.18] I will not go
[8683.18 → 8683.88] back and watch it.
[8683.88 → 8684.00] Yeah,
[8684.06 → 8684.62] it's probably,
[8684.84 → 8685.48] it would not
[8685.48 → 8686.10] convince me to
[8686.10 → 8686.66] rewatch it.
[8686.86 → 8687.10] Yeah.
[8687.10 → 8688.20] I mean,
[8688.88 → 8689.74] hey,
[8689.82 → 8690.30] it's one of
[8690.30 → 8690.86] those
[8690.86 → 8692.00] where there's
[8692.00 → 8692.86] a big difference
[8692.86 → 8693.60] between what
[8693.60 → 8694.62] professional film
[8694.62 → 8695.32] critics thought
[8695.32 → 8695.94] and what the
[8695.94 → 8696.76] audience thought.
[8697.06 → 8697.90] I often like
[8697.90 → 8698.38] those movies.
[8699.32 → 8699.80] Yeah.
[8700.80 → 8701.46] What just
[8701.46 → 8701.82] happened?
[8702.00 → 8702.60] What even is
[8702.60 → 8703.22] this website?
[8704.20 → 8704.48] Yep,
[8704.68 → 8705.08] that's,
[8705.20 → 8705.50] uh,
[8705.96 → 8706.48] I mean,
[8706.48 → 8707.24] that tells you
[8707.24 → 8708.00] everything you
[8708.00 → 8708.58] need to know.
[8708.84 → 8708.96] Yeah.
[8709.18 → 8709.68] The fact that
[8709.68 → 8710.04] he's holding
[8710.04 → 8710.60] two of those.
[8710.96 → 8711.60] And where
[8711.60 → 8711.94] he's holding
[8711.94 → 8712.20] them.
[8712.36 → 8712.56] Yep.
[8712.84 → 8713.08] Yep.
[8713.58 → 8714.06] Anyway.
[8714.52 → 8714.96] Yep.
[8714.96 → 8716.14] Nice.
[8716.54 → 8716.98] Nice.
[8718.62 → 8719.10] Okay,
[8719.10 → 8719.36] what are we
[8719.36 → 8719.70] supposed to be
[8719.70 → 8720.12] talking about?
[8720.40 → 8721.12] Nikon buys
[8721.12 → 8721.44] red?
[8721.66 → 8721.92] Yeah,
[8721.98 → 8722.22] I know.
[8722.32 → 8723.06] Red Digital Cinema.
[8723.26 → 8723.56] What?
[8723.64 → 8724.22] See you later.
[8724.36 → 8724.96] Acquired by
[8724.96 → 8725.46] Nikon.
[8725.82 → 8726.36] Is this a good
[8726.36 → 8726.58] thing?
[8726.66 → 8727.06] Do we like
[8727.06 → 8727.32] this?
[8727.46 → 8728.12] I think we
[8728.12 → 8728.54] just don't
[8728.54 → 8728.84] care.
[8729.08 → 8729.98] I think no
[8729.98 → 8730.38] one really
[8730.38 → 8731.24] cares about
[8731.24 → 8732.00] red anymore.
[8732.42 → 8732.74] And so,
[8732.98 → 8733.78] yeah,
[8733.84 → 8734.38] it's one of
[8734.38 → 8734.74] those things
[8734.74 → 8735.20] that's sort
[8735.20 → 8735.90] of noteworthy
[8735.90 → 8736.30] because it's
[8736.30 → 8736.42] like,
[8736.48 → 8736.68] oh yeah,
[8736.70 → 8737.12] I remember
[8737.12 → 8737.44] red.
[8738.14 → 8738.42] You know,
[8738.50 → 8738.92] when they
[8738.92 → 8739.34] were making
[8739.34 → 8740.62] waves and
[8740.62 → 8741.56] big films
[8741.56 → 8742.06] were using
[8742.06 → 8743.02] red cameras
[8743.02 → 8743.78] and then
[8743.78 → 8744.48] like,
[8744.48 → 8745.38] prominent
[8745.38 → 8746.74] online creators
[8746.74 → 8747.46] were like,
[8747.70 → 8748.10] cool,
[8748.26 → 8748.44] you know,
[8748.50 → 8749.12] red cameras.
[8749.32 → 8749.64] We shoot on
[8749.64 → 8750.02] red now.
[8750.24 → 8750.62] How many
[8750.62 → 8751.90] KS?
[8751.98 → 8752.50] How many
[8752.50 → 8753.08] KS can
[8753.08 → 8753.48] you make?
[8754.10 → 8754.36] And then
[8754.36 → 8755.94] red just
[8755.94 → 8757.62] didn't do
[8757.62 → 8758.50] anything
[8758.50 → 8759.82] for a
[8759.82 → 8760.94] long time
[8760.94 → 8762.64] and
[8762.64 → 8764.36] completely
[8764.36 → 8765.42] faded from
[8765.42 → 8765.92] relevance.
[8766.04 → 8766.40] Remember the
[8766.40 → 8766.90] red phone,
[8766.98 → 8767.18] I know,
[8767.26 → 8767.42] right?
[8767.86 → 8768.46] Completely
[8768.46 → 8769.36] faded from
[8769.36 → 8770.92] relevance and
[8770.92 → 8772.78] I just kind
[8772.78 → 8773.26] of forgot
[8773.26 → 8774.04] they existed.
[8774.48 → 8775.22] like,
[8775.36 → 8775.86] Sony's
[8775.86 → 8776.88] completely
[8776.88 → 8778.38] eaten the
[8778.38 → 8779.22] sort of
[8779.22 → 8780.68] low-end
[8780.68 → 8781.50] filmmaker
[8781.50 → 8782.48] space.
[8783.00 → 8784.62] Ari never
[8784.62 → 8785.36] really seems
[8785.36 → 8785.66] to have
[8785.66 → 8786.28] regarded red
[8786.28 → 8786.72] as anything
[8786.72 → 8787.08] other than
[8787.08 → 8787.50] a minor
[8787.50 → 8788.42] inconvenience.
[8791.38 → 8792.44] Who else
[8792.44 → 8793.22] exists,
[8793.54 → 8794.02] exactly?
[8794.28 → 8794.66] By the way,
[8794.94 → 8795.36] Mike D.
[8795.46 → 8796.44] said,
[8796.66 → 8797.54] July 16th,
[8797.54 → 8798.04] 1990,
[8798.24 → 8799.04] Steve Lyons
[8799.04 → 8799.40] of the
[8799.40 → 8800.18] Chicago White
[8800.18 → 8800.98] Sox pulled
[8800.98 → 8801.42] down his
[8801.42 → 8802.02] pants after
[8802.02 → 8802.58] making it to
[8802.58 → 8803.10] first base.
[8805.40 → 8806.14] He's lucky
[8806.14 → 8806.68] he didn't
[8806.68 → 8806.90] get a
[8806.90 → 8807.42] baseball in
[8807.42 → 8807.58] there.
[8807.72 → 8807.92] Yeah,
[8808.46 → 8809.22] you never
[8809.22 → 8809.58] know.
[8812.48 → 8812.96] Oh,
[8813.04 → 8813.54] come on,
[8813.60 → 8814.02] Black Magic.
[8814.12 → 8814.34] I think
[8814.34 → 8814.82] Black Magic
[8814.82 → 8815.20] is more
[8815.20 → 8815.72] interested in
[8815.72 → 8816.36] the ecosystem
[8816.36 → 8816.98] than cameras
[8816.98 → 8817.46] these days.
[8817.82 → 8818.12] Yeah,
[8818.74 → 8819.12] and like
[8819.12 → 8819.58] doing,
[8819.82 → 8820.18] like their
[8820.18 → 8820.62] green screen
[8820.62 → 8821.32] stuff is so
[8821.32 → 8821.62] cool.
[8822.58 → 8822.86] Yeah,
[8822.86 → 8823.24] that was an
[8823.24 → 8823.66] acquisition,
[8823.90 → 8824.46] the one that
[8824.46 → 8824.70] we have
[8824.70 → 8825.04] upstairs.
[8825.04 → 8825.54] It's so
[8825.54 → 8825.86] cool.
[8825.96 → 8826.70] So cool.
[8826.78 → 8827.64] My goodness,
[8827.72 → 8828.14] that's cool.
[8828.24 → 8828.36] Yeah,
[8828.42 → 8828.80] hardware
[8828.80 → 8829.34] accelerated,
[8829.46 → 8829.70] baby.
[8829.70 → 8830.40] Although I
[8830.40 → 8830.98] gotta imagine
[8830.98 → 8831.78] the next level
[8831.78 → 8832.42] of that is
[8832.42 → 8832.76] going to be
[8832.76 → 8833.58] AI accelerated
[8833.58 → 8833.92] and it's
[8833.92 → 8834.70] gonna absolutely
[8834.70 → 8835.82] blow your
[8835.82 → 8836.58] brain stem away.
[8836.90 → 8837.00] Yeah,
[8837.02 → 8837.32] probably.
[8838.94 → 8839.50] Canon apparently
[8839.50 → 8840.28] does cinema
[8840.28 → 8840.92] cameras too.
[8841.32 → 8841.48] Oh,
[8841.88 → 8842.12] all right,
[8842.18 → 8842.44] shows you
[8842.44 → 8842.82] what I know.
[8843.18 → 8843.66] Imagine just
[8843.66 → 8844.06] being able to
[8844.06 → 8844.16] describe.
[8844.16 → 8844.50] Meanwhile,
[8844.56 → 8845.22] the WAN show
[8845.22 → 8846.60] literally shot
[8846.60 → 8847.20] on C200.
[8847.40 → 8847.96] Totally forgot
[8847.96 → 8848.48] about them.
[8851.08 → 8851.52] Sony's
[8851.52 → 8851.90] killing it,
[8851.96 → 8852.10] man.
[8852.28 → 8852.72] What cameras
[8852.72 → 8853.12] can we put
[8853.12 → 8853.56] somewhere and
[8853.56 → 8854.50] not feel
[8854.50 → 8854.98] sad about?
[8854.98 → 8858.46] I have a
[8858.46 → 8859.24] C100.
[8860.06 → 8860.54] Yeah,
[8860.70 → 8861.12] that's not
[8861.12 → 8861.40] great.
[8861.78 → 8862.18] Those were,
[8862.38 → 8862.84] we used
[8862.84 → 8863.28] those for a
[8863.28 → 8863.40] while.
[8864.76 → 8865.00] Yeah.
[8867.76 → 8868.56] Linux hits
[8868.56 → 8869.04] an all-time
[8869.04 → 8869.40] high.
[8870.58 → 8871.30] According to
[8871.30 → 8872.06] research firm
[8872.06 → 8872.80] Star Counter,
[8873.02 → 8873.46] Linux has
[8873.46 → 8873.88] reached a
[8873.88 → 8876.08] historic 4.03%
[8876.08 → 8876.70] of desktop
[8876.70 → 8877.54] OSes worldwide.
[8877.80 → 8878.20] Don't crap
[8878.20 → 8878.54] on that.
[8878.62 → 8879.54] 4% is a
[8879.54 → 8880.24] freaking lot.
[8881.36 → 8882.04] It's more
[8882.04 → 8882.44] than ever.
[8882.54 → 8882.64] There's a lot
[8882.64 → 8883.20] of desktops.
[8883.40 → 8883.54] Yeah.
[8883.54 → 8885.58] Not including
[8885.58 → 8886.20] Chrome OS,
[8886.36 → 8886.78] by the way.
[8887.64 → 8887.86] Which,
[8887.98 → 8888.64] I thought that
[8888.64 → 8889.00] was it.
[8889.12 → 8889.64] When I first
[8889.64 → 8890.04] read this,
[8890.08 → 8890.38] I was like,
[8890.46 → 8890.64] eh,
[8890.64 → 8891.16] it's Chrome OS.
[8891.46 → 8891.88] No.
[8892.28 → 8892.70] Chrome OS
[8892.70 → 8893.26] accounts for
[8893.26 → 8895.86] another 2.31%.
[8895.86 → 8897.38] Linux also
[8897.38 → 8898.16] shows strong
[8898.16 → 8898.94] upward momentum,
[8899.14 → 8899.76] having only
[8899.76 → 8900.70] passed 3% of
[8900.70 → 8901.18] global market
[8901.18 → 8901.68] share in
[8901.68 → 8902.26] June of
[8902.26 → 8902.94] 2023.
[8904.36 → 8904.84] That's
[8904.84 → 8905.22] actually
[8905.22 → 8906.28] massive
[8906.28 → 8906.82] momentum.
[8907.08 → 8907.82] That's crazy.
[8908.20 → 8908.68] Much of the
[8908.68 → 8909.28] recent growth
[8909.28 → 8909.62] in Linux
[8909.62 → 8910.20] comes from
[8910.20 → 8911.42] adoption overseas,
[8911.60 → 8912.06] such as in
[8912.06 → 8912.44] India,
[8912.56 → 8913.14] where Linux
[8913.14 → 8913.54] is the
[8913.54 → 8914.06] second most
[8914.06 → 8914.88] popular desktop
[8914.88 → 8915.48] OS after
[8915.48 → 8915.82] Windows,
[8915.96 → 8916.56] with over
[8916.56 → 8919.18] 15% market
[8919.18 → 8919.50] share.
[8920.26 → 8921.20] In comparison,
[8921.62 → 8922.18] Linux has a
[8922.18 → 8923.78] 3.85%
[8923.78 → 8924.64] desktop share
[8924.64 → 8925.34] in the US.
[8926.80 → 8927.24] Wow.
[8927.24 → 8927.98] Pretty cool.
[8928.70 → 8929.04] Wow.
[8929.14 → 8929.96] 15%.
[8929.96 → 8931.36] It's huge.
[8931.36 → 8932.88] now what I'd
[8932.88 → 8933.46] like to know,
[8933.46 → 8934.40] and I don't
[8934.40 → 8935.02] know if this
[8935.02 → 8935.80] is addressed
[8935.80 → 8936.26] in any of
[8936.26 → 8936.68] the coverage.

[8937.34 → 8937.78] did a good
[8937.78 → 8938.42] article about
[8938.42 → 8938.66] it.
[8939.28 → 8939.98] I don't know
[8939.98 → 8940.32] if this is
[8940.32 → 8940.74] addressed in
[8940.74 → 8941.06] any of the
[8941.06 → 8941.28] coverage,
[8941.38 → 8941.76] but what I
[8941.76 → 8942.10] would like
[8942.10 → 8942.84] to know is,
[8942.96 → 8943.56] are they
[8943.56 → 8944.34] counting something
[8944.34 → 8944.80] like a
[8944.80 → 8945.30] Steam Deck?
[8945.46 → 8945.80] Yeah,
[8945.88 → 8946.44] there's a note
[8946.44 → 8947.82] in here asking
[8947.82 → 8949.18] essentially the
[8949.18 → 8949.80] same thing.
[8950.10 → 8950.76] I suspect
[8950.76 → 8953.42] they would be.
[8953.86 → 8954.80] They might be,
[8954.96 → 8955.40] but...
[8955.40 → 8956.18] Because apparently
[8956.18 → 8956.68] the data is
[8956.68 → 8957.14] collected from
[8957.14 → 8957.66] web traffic,
[8957.76 → 8958.18] so I think it
[8958.18 → 8958.44] would be.
[8958.44 → 8959.08] So then it's
[8959.08 → 8959.78] also possible
[8959.78 → 8960.32] that Steam
[8960.32 → 8960.80] Decks would
[8960.80 → 8961.40] be massively
[8961.40 → 8962.60] undercounted,
[8963.02 → 8963.62] because the
[8963.62 → 8964.78] Steam Deck is
[8964.78 → 8965.88] first and foremost
[8965.88 → 8966.76] a game console.
[8967.46 → 8968.60] It's a console.
[8969.12 → 8969.82] Everything about
[8969.82 → 8970.72] it is designed
[8970.72 → 8971.98] to be a console
[8971.98 → 8972.64] to the greatest
[8972.64 → 8973.34] degree that Valve
[8973.34 → 8973.88] was able to
[8973.88 → 8974.50] achieve that.
[8974.80 → 8975.54] From the
[8975.54 → 8976.66] instant wake
[8976.66 → 8977.54] to the
[8977.54 → 8978.86] power optimization,
[8979.48 → 8979.86] it's,
[8980.42 → 8980.74] yeah,
[8981.30 → 8981.86] you can plug it
[8981.86 → 8982.42] into a dock.
[8983.02 → 8983.58] Put a keyboard
[8983.58 → 8983.88] and mouse.
[8984.44 → 8985.32] A lot of people
[8985.32 → 8985.66] aren't going to
[8985.66 → 8986.10] do that.
[8986.30 → 8986.58] They're just
[8986.58 → 8987.44] going to game.
[8987.84 → 8988.14] They're just
[8988.14 → 8988.64] going to do
[8988.64 → 8989.22] nothing but
[8989.22 → 8989.74] run Steam
[8989.74 → 8990.94] and game.
[8991.04 → 8991.14] And they're
[8991.14 → 8991.44] not going to
[8991.44 → 8991.66] visit,
[8992.74 → 8993.12] they're not
[8993.12 → 8993.36] going to
[8993.36 → 8993.88] browse the
[8993.88 → 8994.46] web with
[8994.46 → 8994.64] it.
[8995.34 → 8996.20] So in
[8996.20 → 8996.90] my mind,
[8997.24 → 8997.90] this number
[8997.90 → 8999.20] is probably
[8999.20 → 9000.68] underrepresented.
[9000.78 → 9000.98] Now you
[9000.98 → 9001.22] could make
[9001.22 → 9001.52] the same
[9001.52 → 9002.08] arguments for
[9002.08 → 9002.96] other operating
[9002.96 → 9003.46] systems.
[9004.22 → 9004.42] You know,
[9004.46 → 9004.62] oh,
[9004.70 → 9005.20] well on this
[9005.20 → 9005.70] kind of,
[9005.82 → 9005.96] you know,
[9006.04 → 9006.48] on POS
[9006.48 → 9007.32] terminals that
[9007.32 → 9008.56] run Windows,
[9008.74 → 9009.46] of which there
[9009.46 → 9010.02] are millions
[9010.02 → 9010.52] worldwide,
[9010.74 → 9010.90] you know,
[9010.92 → 9011.18] they don't
[9011.18 → 9011.58] browse the
[9011.58 → 9011.96] web on those.
[9012.06 → 9012.38] Sure,
[9012.44 → 9012.54] sure,
[9012.58 → 9012.66] sure,
[9012.72 → 9013.04] fine enough,
[9013.10 → 9013.46] that's fair
[9013.46 → 9013.70] enough.
[9014.26 → 9015.94] But given
[9015.94 → 9017.62] how small
[9017.62 → 9018.18] the Linux
[9018.18 → 9018.86] number is,
[9019.14 → 9019.66] and given
[9019.66 → 9020.42] how many
[9020.42 → 9021.10] Steam decks
[9021.10 → 9022.38] I suspect
[9022.38 → 9023.08] that Valve
[9023.08 → 9023.62] is selling,
[9024.10 → 9024.96] I think it would
[9024.96 → 9025.60] be a significant
[9025.60 → 9026.54] impact compared
[9026.54 → 9027.38] to Windows.
[9027.62 → 9028.00] At the same
[9028.00 → 9028.22] time,
[9028.28 → 9028.64] I think it
[9028.64 → 9029.28] might actually
[9029.28 → 9029.86] be the other
[9029.86 → 9030.44] way around,
[9030.56 → 9031.24] because this
[9031.24 → 9032.12] is arguing
[9032.12 → 9033.82] desktop OSes.
[9034.32 → 9035.12] So if that's
[9035.12 → 9035.50] the case,
[9035.62 → 9036.26] then Steam decks
[9036.26 → 9037.36] involvement at all,
[9037.42 → 9037.86] I think is
[9037.86 → 9038.60] almost cheating.
[9038.60 → 9039.96] No,
[9040.02 → 9040.92] because desktop
[9040.92 → 9041.74] OSes includes
[9041.74 → 9042.28] laptops.
[9043.16 → 9043.46] They can't
[9043.46 → 9043.68] tell the
[9043.68 → 9044.04] difference.
[9045.04 → 9045.64] So if you're
[9045.64 → 9046.04] going to include
[9046.04 → 9046.46] one mobile
[9046.46 → 9046.84] device,
[9047.14 → 9047.56] you got to
[9047.56 → 9047.92] include a
[9047.92 → 9048.34] different mobile
[9048.34 → 9048.70] device.
[9048.86 → 9049.26] I don't know.
[9049.64 → 9050.02] I don't
[9050.02 → 9050.56] consider the
[9050.56 → 9050.76] Steam,
[9050.76 → 9051.44] I consider the
[9051.44 → 9051.76] Steam Deck
[9051.76 → 9052.34] a computer.
[9053.12 → 9053.88] I know I just
[9053.88 → 9054.28] said it's a
[9054.28 → 9054.62] console,
[9055.18 → 9056.42] but I also argue
[9056.42 → 9057.30] that the PS5 is a
[9057.30 → 9057.60] computer,
[9057.76 → 9058.28] so I'm standing
[9058.28 → 9058.48] behind it.
[9058.48 → 9058.66] Is the Switch
[9058.66 → 9059.14] a computer?
[9059.98 → 9060.38] No.
[9062.54 → 9062.94] It's,
[9063.18 → 9063.46] yes,
[9063.84 → 9064.90] but it doesn't
[9064.90 → 9065.68] have any kind
[9065.68 → 9066.04] of general
[9066.04 → 9067.08] purpose utility.
[9067.08 → 9068.54] Steam Deck
[9068.54 → 9068.68] does.
[9068.68 → 9068.98] Steam Deck
[9068.98 → 9069.32] does.
[9069.44 → 9069.72] It's a
[9069.72 → 9070.14] computer.
[9070.44 → 9070.60] Yeah.
[9071.86 → 9072.56] I think that's
[9072.56 → 9073.04] probably fair
[9073.04 → 9073.28] enough.
[9073.46 → 9073.92] I'm trying to
[9073.92 → 9074.34] pick it apart,
[9074.46 → 9074.84] but I think it's
[9074.84 → 9074.90] fair.
[9074.90 → 9076.26] I think it's
[9076.26 → 9076.78] kind of on the
[9076.78 → 9077.00] edge.
[9077.08 → 9077.52] We made a
[9077.52 → 9078.10] very similar
[9078.10 → 9079.22] argument once
[9079.22 → 9079.88] the
[9079.88 → 9080.56] once the
[9080.56 → 9081.10] um,
[9083.10 → 9083.50] um,
[9083.50 → 9085.54] once you could,
[9085.66 → 9086.28] once you could
[9086.28 → 9086.80] put the Xbox
[9086.80 → 9087.72] in dev mode and
[9087.72 → 9088.40] install, you know,
[9088.46 → 9089.32] emulators on it
[9089.32 → 9090.02] and a browser and
[9090.02 → 9090.82] whatever, it's okay,
[9090.92 → 9091.76] it's just a
[9091.76 → 9092.34] computer now.
[9092.56 → 9093.54] Yeah, like if you
[9093.54 → 9094.18] plug the right
[9094.18 → 9094.90] things into it,
[9094.92 → 9095.62] you can literally
[9095.62 → 9096.12] run,
[9096.12 → 9098.24] Jaden used a
[9098.24 → 9099.34] Steam Deck as his
[9099.34 → 9100.54] development computer
[9100.54 → 9101.36] at work for a
[9101.36 → 9101.78] while because we
[9101.78 → 9103.30] didn't have a PC
[9103.30 → 9103.74] for him.
[9104.58 → 9104.94] So he,
[9105.14 → 9106.46] it was temporary
[9106.46 → 9107.38] and he actually
[9107.38 → 9108.06] kind of liked it
[9108.06 → 9108.46] and it worked
[9108.46 → 9108.78] fine.
[9108.92 → 9109.68] So like,
[9110.58 → 9110.92] yeah,
[9111.08 → 9112.08] I think the
[9112.08 → 9112.70] argument's fine.
[9115.22 → 9116.00] It's exciting.
[9116.40 → 9116.68] Yeah,
[9116.86 → 9117.22] it's cool.
[9117.44 → 9117.84] It's good.
[9117.96 → 9118.74] Is it time again?
[9119.26 → 9119.56] No,
[9119.56 → 9121.14] not yet.
[9121.78 → 9122.82] I wonder on SteamOS.
[9123.04 → 9123.46] I think it would be too early.
[9124.08 → 9125.32] Valve, where is SteamOS?
[9125.32 → 9125.80] Yeah.
[9126.24 → 9127.14] Come on, man.
[9127.32 → 9128.18] Let us run on the computer.
[9128.56 → 9130.04] Especially with, um,
[9130.24 → 9131.18] all these like,
[9131.34 → 9132.76] hyper-invasive anti-cheats,
[9132.92 → 9133.38] which are like,
[9133.42 → 9134.48] the only way forward
[9134.48 → 9136.70] because there's a
[9136.70 → 9138.02] unprecedented,
[9138.42 → 9139.58] insane amount of people
[9139.58 → 9140.44] cheating in multiplayer
[9140.44 → 9141.10] games right now.
[9141.68 → 9142.16] Um,
[9143.12 → 9143.40] I,
[9143.86 → 9144.22] like,
[9144.48 → 9144.86] would,
[9145.22 → 9146.72] we're talking about
[9146.72 → 9147.48] how the console's
[9147.48 → 9147.98] dying.
[9147.98 → 9149.30] I think
[9149.30 → 9150.68] gaming device
[9150.68 → 9151.88] is going to be a thing
[9151.88 → 9152.08] though.
[9153.16 → 9154.08] So I think you like,
[9154.16 → 9154.76] might legitimately
[9154.76 → 9155.94] not want to do
[9155.94 → 9156.92] all the things you do
[9156.92 → 9157.48] on a computer
[9157.48 → 9159.14] on your gaming computer
[9159.14 → 9160.22] if you're playing
[9160.22 → 9160.82] a bunch of games
[9160.82 → 9161.36] that have these
[9161.36 → 9162.08] hyper-invasive
[9162.08 → 9162.68] kernel-level
[9162.68 → 9163.30] anti-cheats.
[9164.30 → 9165.04] So like,
[9165.64 → 9166.98] there's some idea there.
[9168.98 → 9169.68] Power Software has
[9169.68 → 9170.72] opinions on kernel-level
[9170.72 → 9171.22] anti-cheat?
[9171.38 → 9171.62] Yeah.
[9171.62 → 9173.48] I know.
[9176.24 → 9176.64] Hmm.
[9181.26 → 9181.66] Man,
[9181.98 → 9182.96] how do we fix
[9182.96 → 9184.00] cheating in games
[9184.00 → 9184.82] the way that they are
[9184.82 → 9185.24] right now?
[9189.78 → 9190.70] You can't fix it
[9190.70 → 9191.48] at an OS level.
[9191.72 → 9192.66] You can't fix it
[9192.66 → 9193.36] at a game level.
[9193.50 → 9194.18] You can't fix it.
[9194.42 → 9195.00] Can't fix it
[9195.00 → 9195.78] at a driver level.
[9195.88 → 9196.66] You just can't fix it.
[9197.30 → 9198.10] And video games?
[9198.80 → 9199.32] Can you fix it
[9199.32 → 9200.20] at a hardware level?
[9200.52 → 9201.40] In my opinion,
[9201.62 → 9203.96] you have to fix it.
[9205.24 → 9205.96] And you still
[9205.96 → 9206.72] won't be able to fix it.
[9206.80 → 9207.50] You have to
[9207.50 → 9208.68] try to alleviate it.
[9208.70 → 9209.58] This is why I push
[9209.58 → 9211.14] so hard with Markov,
[9211.28 → 9211.96] which they're never
[9211.96 → 9212.48] going to do it.
[9212.98 → 9213.78] But this is why
[9213.78 → 9214.24] I push so hard
[9214.24 → 9214.70] for them to have
[9214.70 → 9215.60] the replay system.
[9216.28 → 9216.68] Yeah.
[9218.10 → 9218.50] Because
[9218.50 → 9220.40] like,
[9220.54 → 9221.58] people used to
[9221.58 → 9222.26] love,
[9222.46 → 9222.84] love,
[9222.92 → 9223.10] love,
[9223.18 → 9223.76] love the
[9223.76 → 9225.18] whatever it was
[9225.18 → 9225.82] called system,
[9225.92 → 9226.58] Overwatch system
[9226.58 → 9227.32] for Counter-Strike
[9227.32 → 9228.38] where
[9228.38 → 9230.10] reported users
[9230.10 → 9230.52] would go into
[9230.52 → 9231.52] this Overwatches queue
[9231.52 → 9232.32] and users
[9232.32 → 9233.22] in good standing
[9233.22 → 9234.06] could review
[9234.06 → 9234.98] the Overwatch queue
[9234.98 → 9235.88] and then like
[9235.88 → 9236.72] basically vote
[9236.72 → 9237.22] on what they
[9237.22 → 9237.72] thought it was
[9237.72 → 9238.00] and they would
[9238.00 → 9238.56] show it to a bunch
[9238.56 → 9239.16] of different people
[9239.16 → 9240.46] to get like a vote
[9240.46 → 9241.14] on if this person
[9241.14 → 9241.88] was cheating or not.
[9242.92 → 9243.86] People liked it
[9243.86 → 9244.50] so much
[9244.50 → 9245.90] that Counter-Strike
[9245.90 → 9246.86] creators would just
[9246.86 → 9247.58] stream themselves
[9247.58 → 9248.06] going through
[9248.06 → 9248.90] the Overwatch queue
[9248.90 → 9249.90] because it was
[9249.90 → 9250.32] interesting.
[9250.32 → 9253.18] and I actually
[9253.18 → 9253.80] think it helped
[9253.80 → 9255.18] very significantly
[9255.18 → 9256.74] because they're
[9256.74 → 9257.18] never going to
[9257.18 → 9257.48] be able to
[9257.48 → 9258.10] detect everything.
[9258.22 → 9258.54] It's just not
[9258.54 → 9258.94] going to happen.
[9259.14 → 9259.70] Tell me this.
[9261.74 → 9263.00] If a game developer
[9263.00 → 9263.76] was willing to
[9263.76 → 9264.54] implement support
[9264.54 → 9265.04] for it,
[9267.12 → 9268.62] so by support
[9268.62 → 9268.98] for it,
[9269.04 → 9269.52] I mean
[9269.52 → 9271.38] locked off servers
[9271.38 → 9272.36] where only people
[9272.36 → 9273.20] who have this
[9273.20 → 9274.02] device can
[9274.02 → 9274.50] participate,
[9274.50 → 9276.46] would you buy
[9276.46 → 9277.28] a device
[9277.28 → 9278.44] that is
[9278.44 → 9278.98] essentially
[9278.98 → 9280.62] a camera
[9280.62 → 9283.10] and a piece
[9283.10 → 9283.64] of software
[9283.64 → 9284.44] that monitors
[9284.44 → 9285.12] the screen
[9285.12 → 9287.66] that uses
[9287.66 → 9288.74] machine vision
[9288.74 → 9291.00] to track
[9291.00 → 9292.68] your actions
[9292.68 → 9293.30] on your
[9293.30 → 9294.02] peripherals
[9294.02 → 9295.20] and track,
[9295.26 → 9295.56] hold on,
[9295.62 → 9295.92] hold on,
[9296.56 → 9296.80] just,
[9297.12 → 9298.18] I'm waiting,
[9298.18 → 9298.58] I'm waiting.
[9298.72 → 9299.10] Locally.
[9299.80 → 9301.00] Locally tracks
[9301.00 → 9302.02] what's happening
[9302.02 → 9303.02] on your peripherals
[9303.02 → 9304.52] and locally tracks
[9304.52 → 9304.98] what's happening
[9304.98 → 9305.70] on your screen
[9305.70 → 9306.72] and ensures
[9306.72 → 9307.86] that they correspond.
[9308.32 → 9309.04] It's not enough.
[9309.54 → 9310.28] Why not?
[9310.82 → 9311.50] In Markov,
[9311.58 → 9312.34] people cheat.
[9313.60 → 9314.38] This one's
[9314.38 → 9315.24] very debatable
[9315.24 → 9316.64] how much it's used,
[9316.98 → 9317.54] but a lot of people
[9317.54 → 9318.34] think it's a lot.
[9318.80 → 9319.06] And like,
[9319.10 → 9319.54] if you remember
[9319.54 → 9320.28] Goat's video,
[9320.50 → 9321.64] he was only detecting
[9321.64 → 9322.72] people that were doing
[9322.72 → 9323.92] this style of cheating
[9323.92 → 9324.82] where it's a cheat
[9324.82 → 9325.80] that's on your screen.
[9325.90 → 9326.64] They can see
[9326.64 → 9327.32] through walls,
[9327.52 → 9328.34] they can see wireframes
[9328.34 → 9328.84] through walls,
[9328.90 → 9329.48] all that type of stuff.
[9329.60 → 9330.58] There's another form
[9330.58 → 9330.96] of cheating.
[9331.14 → 9332.04] And this form of cheating
[9332.04 → 9333.06] is in multiple games
[9333.06 → 9333.92] where you have
[9333.92 → 9335.38] an external computer.
[9335.50 → 9336.18] So you have a
[9336.32 → 9337.22] what is it?
[9339.00 → 9339.88] DMA device?
[9340.18 → 9341.24] Direct memory access device.
[9341.76 → 9342.94] You go to an external computer
[9342.94 → 9344.50] and then you can see
[9344.50 → 9346.28] people on the other computer.
[9347.22 → 9347.94] So you're talking
[9347.94 → 9348.98] about your own screen.
[9349.22 → 9350.20] Some people cheat
[9350.20 → 9350.98] with a completely
[9350.98 → 9351.76] external screen.
[9351.86 → 9352.48] No, that's true.
[9353.96 → 9354.40] But,
[9355.04 → 9355.30] yeah,
[9355.32 → 9356.30] I guess that wouldn't help
[9356.30 → 9356.84] because then everything
[9356.84 → 9357.94] would still correspond
[9357.94 → 9358.88] and unless it's
[9358.88 → 9359.70] watching your eyes.
[9359.80 → 9360.40] Okay, so,
[9361.14 → 9361.30] next.
[9361.30 → 9362.02] Eye tracking as well.
[9362.02 → 9362.42] Next level.
[9362.58 → 9363.16] Now you're not allowed
[9363.16 → 9364.48] looking at a spare monitor though.
[9365.52 → 9366.94] Well, you're not allowed to,
[9367.62 → 9368.10] basically,
[9368.24 → 9369.18] you would still be able
[9369.18 → 9370.14] to do some stuff.
[9370.48 → 9371.16] Like, you'd be able
[9371.16 → 9371.88] to stop moving,
[9372.42 → 9373.46] look at something else,
[9374.36 → 9375.56] mime that you're
[9375.56 → 9376.50] doing something.
[9377.28 → 9377.96] No, you wouldn't
[9377.96 → 9378.96] because you're just
[9378.96 → 9379.96] looking at something else.
[9380.18 → 9380.72] You'd be able
[9380.72 → 9381.52] to take your mouse off,
[9381.68 → 9382.76] your hand off your mouse
[9382.76 → 9383.52] and pretend you're looking
[9383.52 → 9384.34] at your phone over here
[9384.34 → 9385.04] for a little bit
[9385.04 → 9386.32] and then you'd be able
[9386.32 → 9387.52] to go back to your thing.
[9387.52 → 9388.94] But that would put you
[9388.94 → 9389.56] at a significant
[9389.56 → 9390.58] competitive disadvantage
[9390.58 → 9391.54] in a lot of games.
[9392.56 → 9393.20] If you actually,
[9393.56 → 9394.12] so, okay,
[9394.42 → 9395.36] so, theoretically,
[9395.52 → 9396.08] remember guys,
[9396.80 → 9399.06] this is a theoretical product.
[9399.90 → 9400.82] So, theoretically,
[9401.24 → 9402.06] it is a device
[9402.06 → 9402.84] that has a camera
[9402.84 → 9403.36] that monitors
[9403.36 → 9404.12] your hand movements,
[9404.66 → 9405.50] an eye tracker
[9405.50 → 9406.18] that monitors
[9406.18 → 9406.90] your eye movements,
[9407.32 → 9408.96] and then a piece of software
[9408.96 → 9410.42] that is tied into it,
[9410.66 → 9411.36] or better yet,
[9411.44 → 9412.16] not software.
[9412.16 → 9413.74] A third camera
[9413.74 → 9415.34] that monitors the screen
[9415.34 → 9416.70] and ensures that
[9416.70 → 9417.84] everything is synced.
[9417.98 → 9419.16] And how does this work?
[9419.30 → 9419.68] It, like,
[9419.72 → 9421.12] reports an okay
[9421.12 → 9421.84] signal?
[9422.00 → 9422.34] Basically,
[9422.62 → 9423.28] it's an,
[9423.56 → 9424.32] meh, meh,
[9424.38 → 9425.48] everything's fine alarm
[9425.48 → 9426.34] all the time,
[9426.52 → 9426.74] and it,
[9426.80 → 9427.32] so it'll ping,
[9427.72 → 9428.64] it'll ping the multiplayer
[9428.64 → 9429.88] server saying everything's okay,
[9429.96 → 9430.44] everything's okay,
[9430.50 → 9431.08] everything's okay,
[9431.14 → 9431.64] and then if any,
[9431.72 → 9432.70] if it ever stops,
[9433.28 → 9434.66] then you're kicked
[9434.66 → 9435.80] immediately.
[9437.70 → 9438.76] If it worked,
[9439.80 → 9440.78] let's say it's,
[9441.38 → 9441.82] I'm gonna,
[9442.16 → 9443.36] hold on,
[9443.42 → 9444.34] let's do stages of this,
[9444.44 → 9444.76] hold on,
[9444.94 → 9445.70] let's just,
[9446.20 → 9447.60] it's what I've described so far.
[9448.42 → 9450.50] Would you consider buying it?
[9451.56 → 9453.22] If there was a big enough ecosystem
[9453.22 → 9454.84] that you knew that in a game
[9454.84 → 9455.68] you like to play,
[9456.58 → 9457.74] other people would be using it,
[9457.80 → 9458.62] and you could play on a
[9458.62 → 9459.38] cheat-free server.
[9460.72 → 9462.62] It sounds so susceptible to,
[9462.78 → 9463.78] ignore that though.
[9463.78 → 9464.46] It sounds like such a massive honeypot.
[9464.52 → 9464.90] Ignore that,
[9464.90 → 9465.58] let's say it worked.
[9466.30 → 9466.94] And, like,
[9467.02 → 9468.62] wasn't a giant honeypot
[9468.62 → 9469.30] for people to come?
[9470.02 → 9471.10] Everything was essentially
[9471.10 → 9471.98] locally stored,
[9471.98 → 9472.64] other than the
[9472.64 → 9473.54] everything's okay alarm.
[9473.80 → 9474.44] Yeah, people could see.
[9475.74 → 9476.54] Yeah, probably,
[9476.62 → 9477.02] to be honest.
[9477.18 → 9477.42] Okay.
[9477.46 → 9478.56] And I'd just cover up the cameras
[9478.56 → 9479.14] when I wasn't playing.
[9479.24 → 9480.32] Well, let's talk about the pricing.
[9481.18 → 9481.40] Oh.
[9482.08 → 9482.48] I mean,
[9482.60 → 9483.06] that doesn't,
[9483.98 → 9484.58] whoa, hello,
[9484.82 → 9485.56] buddy.
[9485.56 → 9488.22] That doesn't sound cheap.
[9488.82 → 9489.18] No.
[9489.32 → 9490.94] Let's say it's $300.
[9491.44 → 9492.68] Does it work in multiple games?
[9493.10 → 9494.10] It works in any game
[9494.10 → 9494.66] where the developer
[9494.66 → 9495.50] implements support
[9495.50 → 9496.74] and has cheat-free,
[9497.24 → 9497.32] like,
[9497.50 → 9497.72] like,
[9497.96 → 9498.62] cheat-eye
[9498.62 → 9500.82] or whatever you want to call it.
[9500.82 → 9501.58] can we assume this is,
[9501.66 → 9501.76] like,
[9501.92 → 9503.12] not 100%,
[9503.12 → 9504.06] but pretty ubiquitous?
[9504.54 → 9505.62] It's not ubiquitous.
[9505.86 → 9506.02] No.
[9506.02 → 9507.98] It's supported in a handful of games,
[9507.98 → 9509.44] but one or two of them
[9509.44 → 9510.16] happen to be ones
[9510.16 → 9511.14] that you like to play.
[9512.28 → 9513.42] I would consider it,
[9513.50 → 9514.12] depending on the games.
[9514.38 → 9514.66] $300.
[9515.06 → 9515.76] I would consider it,
[9515.82 → 9516.36] depending on the games.
[9516.42 → 9517.24] Let's say it was supported
[9517.24 → 9517.82] in Markov.
[9518.18 → 9518.34] Yeah.
[9518.78 → 9519.70] Would you play,
[9519.80 → 9520.68] would you play,
[9520.92 → 9521.72] whatever,
[9521.88 → 9522.30] not raids,
[9522.42 → 9523.14] not extractions,
[9523.28 → 9523.90] whatever they're called,
[9524.34 → 9524.78] instances,
[9525.14 → 9525.34] raids,
[9525.46 → 9525.58] sure.
[9525.96 → 9527.02] Would you play raids
[9527.02 → 9528.90] with this device
[9528.90 → 9530.04] and this device alone
[9530.04 → 9530.78] if it was available
[9530.78 → 9531.32], and would you spend
[9531.32 → 9531.88] the money on it?
[9535.16 → 9535.68] I think,
[9535.68 → 9536.48] I think you'd have to be
[9536.48 → 9537.16] in lobbies only
[9537.16 → 9538.16] with other people using it.
[9538.32 → 9538.56] Well, yeah,
[9538.64 → 9538.96] you would.
[9539.24 → 9540.28] So you'd have exclusive.
[9540.52 → 9542.04] And I think there's,
[9542.20 → 9542.64] like I said,
[9542.68 → 9543.66] the external monitor thing
[9543.66 → 9544.46] is still going to happen.
[9544.46 → 9552.22] I don't know.
[9552.30 → 9553.06] It's not a guarantee
[9553.06 → 9554.66] because the external monitor thing
[9554.66 → 9556.14] is there's,
[9556.22 → 9556.40] there's,
[9556.48 → 9557.38] we really have no idea
[9557.38 → 9558.62] what percentage of people
[9558.62 → 9559.22] are using that.
[9559.40 → 9559.62] Yep.
[9559.82 → 9560.38] That's fair.
[9560.60 → 9561.66] We know it's a lot.
[9562.24 → 9563.38] We know it's like actually
[9563.38 → 9565.02] a huge amount of people
[9565.02 → 9566.58] because there's a weird thing
[9566.58 → 9567.60] where that's the easiest way
[9567.60 → 9568.44] to cheat with your friends
[9568.44 → 9568.88] as well
[9568.88 → 9572.12] because it's the least suspicious
[9572.12 → 9573.38] to the other people
[9573.38 → 9574.14] that you're playing with.
[9574.46 → 9574.88] Right.
[9577.02 → 9577.46] If,
[9577.54 → 9577.72] if,
[9577.82 → 9579.22] if it could get around that,
[9579.56 → 9579.90] yeah,
[9580.02 → 9580.78] I think I would
[9580.78 → 9581.68] because
[9581.68 → 9583.44] I,
[9583.64 → 9584.06] to me,
[9584.10 → 9585.48] to be completely honest,
[9585.56 → 9586.12] to me,
[9586.52 → 9589.38] like first-person shooter
[9589.38 → 9590.70] style competitive games
[9590.70 → 9591.06] right now
[9591.06 → 9592.18] are actually just ruined.
[9593.14 → 9594.60] I don't think any of them is.
[9594.70 → 9595.30] I don't even think
[9595.30 → 9596.40] that's a controversial take.
[9596.48 → 9597.58] Someone told me like,
[9597.66 → 9597.82] oh,
[9597.82 → 9599.02] but there's no cheating in Valorant.
[9599.08 → 9600.42] They have the kernel level
[9600.42 → 9600.96] anti-cheat
[9600.96 → 9601.90] and it's like,
[9601.90 → 9602.88] but like,
[9603.06 → 9603.64] brush,
[9604.52 → 9605.80] YouTube it.
[9606.60 → 9607.68] They're everywhere.
[9608.18 → 9608.70] Like,
[9609.06 → 9610.20] maybe it helps them.
[9610.44 → 9610.78] Maybe.
[9611.70 → 9612.88] But ultimately,
[9612.88 → 9614.02] this is a
[9614.14 → 9615.14] this is a like
[9615.14 → 9615.96] back and forth
[9615.96 → 9616.66] that will go forever.
[9616.66 → 9617.00] Okay.
[9617.12 → 9617.90] So here's one.
[9619.50 → 9619.90] Elijah,
[9620.32 → 9620.72] uh,
[9620.80 → 9621.76] said something else,
[9621.76 → 9622.90] but it made me think of
[9622.90 → 9623.60] something different.
[9623.80 → 9623.92] Yeah.
[9624.12 → 9624.48] Good job,
[9624.54 → 9624.76] Elijah.
[9625.46 → 9625.90] Um,
[9626.20 → 9626.80] you're doing great.
[9626.92 → 9627.52] It's a value.
[9627.60 → 9628.10] It's a valuable,
[9628.28 → 9629.12] it's a valuable skill.
[9629.70 → 9631.12] Knowing that there's going to be,
[9631.22 → 9633.04] knowing that there's going to be a cost
[9633.04 → 9634.10] in terms of latency,
[9634.50 → 9634.76] right?
[9634.78 → 9635.62] You're going to probably,
[9635.80 → 9637.36] it'll cost you a frame of latency.
[9637.36 → 9638.58] Let's say 15 milliseconds.
[9638.58 → 9642.62] Would you play a competitive shooter
[9642.62 → 9645.20] from a cloud stream service?
[9646.44 → 9649.30] If you knew that every other client connected
[9649.30 → 9652.04] was also using the same cloud stream service
[9652.04 → 9653.58] and the whole thing was running locally
[9653.58 → 9655.74] so they could monitor what absolutely everyone is doing.
[9655.98 → 9657.54] So nothing goes in,
[9658.02 → 9658.90] nothing goes out
[9658.90 → 9660.74] other than mouse and keyboard inputs
[9660.74 → 9662.30] and frame data.
[9665.08 → 9667.00] Would that be more fun these days?
[9667.32 → 9668.26] If everyone's doing it,
[9668.26 → 9668.66] I think so.
[9668.68 → 9669.50] If everyone's on it.
[9669.50 → 9671.42] Because the biggest thing is not,
[9671.46 → 9672.36] it's not getting owned
[9672.36 → 9673.14] because like,
[9673.18 → 9673.46] you know,
[9673.52 → 9674.62] I'm getting older,
[9674.70 → 9675.82] I'm getting a little bit slower,
[9675.96 → 9677.66] I'm not as good at FPS games
[9677.66 → 9678.34] as I used to be.
[9678.52 → 9679.70] I also don't play them as much.
[9679.82 → 9680.14] Like,
[9680.16 → 9680.76] it's just not,
[9681.50 → 9682.08] that's fine.
[9682.20 → 9682.86] I'm going to lose.
[9683.88 → 9684.28] Um,
[9686.50 → 9687.00] it's,
[9687.04 → 9688.26] it's having a
[9688.26 → 9691.32] very legitimized theory
[9691.32 → 9693.72] that the person that just beat you
[9693.72 → 9695.06] might be cheating.
[9695.26 → 9695.50] Yeah.
[9695.88 → 9697.70] And like in that seat of doubt,
[9697.70 → 9700.08] it just ruins the whole thing.
[9700.22 → 9701.14] And like in Markov,
[9701.20 → 9701.96] they added a thing
[9701.96 → 9703.34] where you can view people's profiles
[9703.34 → 9704.16] after they kill you.
[9704.82 → 9705.60] And it's like,
[9705.66 → 9705.80] oh,
[9705.88 → 9706.14] cool.
[9706.30 → 9708.34] This guy has a 75% extraction rate.
[9709.50 → 9710.72] Probably just died to a cheater.
[9710.94 → 9711.80] Go into the next game.
[9711.80 → 9713.82] This guy has 17 KD.
[9715.98 → 9717.54] That is definitely possible.
[9717.54 → 9718.76] There are people that are
[9718.76 → 9719.32] perfect.
[9719.74 → 9720.20] Definitely legit
[9720.20 → 9722.60] that definitely have KDs better than that.
[9723.32 → 9724.76] That dude's probably not one of them.
[9725.46 → 9725.86] Right?
[9726.00 → 9726.16] Like,
[9726.24 → 9727.24] I don't know.
[9727.68 → 9728.04] Um,
[9728.04 → 9730.00] and it just sucks.
[9730.16 → 9731.20] Time to break out World of Tanks.
[9732.62 → 9733.16] Let's see.
[9733.30 → 9733.74] Let's see.
[9734.72 → 9736.72] World of Tanks cheats.
[9738.54 → 9739.62] Cheats are World of Tanks.
[9740.88 → 9741.64] World of Tanks banned
[9741.64 → 9743.12] thousands of cheaters in February.
[9743.60 → 9744.84] How to cheat in World of Tanks.
[9745.44 → 9746.62] The legal aim cheat
[9746.62 → 9747.14] World of Tanks
[9747.14 → 9748.20] doesn't want you to know about.
[9748.20 → 9752.84] All right.
[9754.40 → 9755.44] Multiplayer competitive games
[9755.44 → 9757.14] are covered in cheaters right now.
[9757.24 → 9758.52] It's actually crazy.
[9758.84 → 9759.98] It's mostly in like
[9759.98 → 9761.70] games that involve projectiles.
[9762.14 → 9762.70] So I was going to say
[9762.70 → 9763.56] first-person shooter,
[9763.76 → 9764.42] but I don't know if you
[9764.42 → 9765.94] Hell divers has a problem.
[9766.70 → 9767.22] Does it?
[9767.90 → 9769.22] In a EVE
[9769.22 → 9770.14] like
[9770.14 → 9771.72] multiplayer game.
[9772.52 → 9773.44] People suck.
[9773.64 → 9774.04] Teamwork.
[9774.20 → 9774.40] Yeah.
[9776.58 → 9777.20] If you,
[9777.28 → 9777.80] if you're cheating
[9777.80 → 9778.36] in Hell divers,
[9778.66 → 9781.22] you are not a citizen.
[9784.64 → 9785.08] Wow.
[9785.32 → 9786.80] That is not very democratic of you.
[9787.08 → 9787.24] Not,
[9787.64 → 9788.96] declared not a citizen.
[9789.14 → 9789.40] Got him.
[9789.52 → 9789.80] Not,
[9789.84 → 9790.76] not patriotic
[9790.76 → 9791.52] at all.
[9791.70 → 9793.14] Service guarantee citizenship.
[9793.42 → 9794.44] You belong to the bugs.
[9795.72 → 9796.16] Uh,
[9796.20 → 9796.58] all right.
[9796.66 → 9797.54] Are there any other topics
[9797.54 → 9799.04] that we really need to hit here?
[9799.94 → 9800.32] Uh,
[9800.42 → 9802.14] European new car assessment program
[9802.14 → 9803.04] has declared that
[9803.04 → 9804.62] all cars need physical controls
[9804.62 → 9805.12] like buttons,
[9805.22 → 9805.38] switches,
[9805.48 → 9806.68] and dials for important features
[9806.68 → 9807.40] like turn signals,
[9807.40 → 9808.04] windshield wipers,
[9808.12 → 9808.32] horns,
[9808.46 → 9809.10] hazard warning lights,
[9809.14 → 9810.58] and any built-in SOS features.
[9810.78 → 9811.36] I mean,
[9811.40 → 9812.74] that should have been common sense before,
[9812.84 → 9813.12] but hey,
[9813.18 → 9813.68] thanks Tesla.
[9814.04 → 9814.10] Personally,
[9814.18 → 9815.12] I support that a lot.
[9815.22 → 9815.38] Yep.
[9815.82 → 9816.18] And,
[9816.24 → 9816.38] uh,
[9816.38 → 9818.12] Oregon passed a right to repair law
[9818.12 → 9820.14] that Apple is not a fan of.
[9821.26 → 9821.70] Um,
[9822.24 → 9824.18] basically they're going after,
[9824.18 → 9825.38] uh,
[9825.44 → 9827.30] locking components,
[9827.36 → 9828.66] like serializing components,
[9828.66 → 9829.82] and locking them to,
[9829.92 → 9830.10] uh,
[9830.10 → 9831.24] a particular device.
[9831.24 → 9831.96] Uh,
[9831.96 → 9834.22] Google has been vocally in support of the bill,
[9834.28 → 9835.62] but Apple has expressed concern,
[9835.62 → 9836.76] saying that the bill's language
[9836.76 → 9837.92] around parts pairing
[9837.92 → 9839.38] could force them to
[9839.38 → 9841.40] allow third-party biometric sensors
[9841.40 → 9842.28] to work on our devices
[9842.28 → 9843.90] without any form of authentication,
[9843.90 → 9845.42] which could lead to unauthorized access
[9845.42 → 9846.68] to an individual's personal data,
[9846.68 → 9847.40] uh,
[9847.40 → 9848.72] to the detriment of customers everywhere
[9848.72 → 9850.00] because they do not have the ability
[9850.00 → 9851.88] to restrict such provisions regionally.
[9852.38 → 9852.70] Um,
[9852.78 → 9853.00] yeah,
[9853.28 → 9853.50] yeah,
[9853.50 → 9854.74] you're going to have to just figure it out,
[9854.80 → 9854.96] Apple,
[9855.00 → 9855.76] which we know you can,
[9855.94 → 9856.54] so just do it
[9856.54 → 9857.68] because you did it before,
[9857.80 → 9858.66] so just do it like that.
[9859.26 → 9859.66] Um,
[9860.72 → 9860.92] yeah,
[9860.98 → 9862.50] the bill covers all consumer electronics,
[9862.64 → 9863.82] but excludes motor vehicles,
[9863.92 → 9864.32] farming equipment,
[9864.90 → 9865.14] really?
[9866.76 → 9867.58] Medical devices,
[9867.76 → 9868.46] HVAC systems,
[9868.62 → 9869.80] why HVAC systems,
[9869.94 → 9870.72] game consoles,
[9870.96 → 9871.32] why?
[9872.16 → 9874.64] Solar panels and electric toothbrushes.
[9875.14 → 9876.30] So right to repair doesn't,
[9876.74 → 9877.36] what is this,
[9877.42 → 9878.34] the Oral-B lobby?
[9878.56 → 9878.70] Like,
[9878.84 → 9880.02] what's going on?
[9880.14 → 9880.26] Yeah,
[9880.32 → 9880.84] why can't,
[9880.88 → 9881.76] why can't you do that?
[9881.86 → 9882.68] Like Colgate owns everything.
[9882.68 → 9883.08] Like what's,
[9883.12 → 9883.92] what's going to happen
[9883.92 → 9885.80] if you fix your own toothbrush?
[9886.08 → 9886.40] What do you,
[9886.62 → 9887.58] what risk is this?
[9887.62 → 9887.78] Your,
[9887.78 → 9889.50] your teeth data is going to be,
[9890.06 → 9891.22] you know,
[9891.58 → 9893.06] it's a medical device.
[9893.20 → 9893.52] I don't know.
[9893.58 → 9893.98] Unbelievable.
[9895.92 → 9896.54] All right.
[9898.38 → 9899.30] I think it's time for
[9899.30 → 9900.00] Wand show After Dark.
[9900.42 → 9900.86] All right.
[9901.38 → 9901.74] Now.
[9902.08 → 9902.44] Fine,
[9902.46 → 9902.82] I'll do it.
[9903.22 → 9903.48] Yeah.
[9903.74 → 9903.94] Now,
[9904.00 → 9905.16] do you guys want to read
[9905.16 → 9906.14] your own merch messages
[9906.14 → 9907.32] and then I go upstairs
[9907.32 → 9908.40] and prepare things
[9908.40 → 9909.78] so that we can have a
[9909.86 → 9910.28] we can do that.
[9910.28 → 9911.38] faster switch over?
[9911.76 → 9912.00] Yeah,
[9912.04 → 9912.26] I can,
[9912.36 → 9912.68] 8%.
[9912.68 → 9913.68] 8%?
[9913.98 → 9914.72] I can be Dan.
[9916.68 → 9917.60] What am I doing?
[9917.74 → 9918.38] Wand show after Dark?
[9919.56 → 9920.26] That's the button.
[9920.74 → 9920.92] Okay,
[9920.92 → 9921.18] bye.
[9921.58 → 9922.16] Good luck.
[9922.16 → 9925.94] he's,
[9926.04 → 9926.08] he's,
[9926.08 → 9926.50] he's,
[9926.50 → 9927.48] he's also leaving.
[9928.44 → 9928.96] Uh,
[9929.02 → 9931.16] I'm just gonna,
[9931.22 → 9932.14] I'm just going to take one of these
[9932.14 → 9932.86] that I can answer.
[9933.36 → 9933.76] Um,
[9935.06 → 9936.28] I'd click to broadcast.
[9936.42 → 9937.16] Did that do the thing?
[9937.22 → 9937.80] I think so.
[9938.18 → 9938.64] Um,
[9938.70 → 9939.00] hello,
[9939.28 → 9940.96] DLL is using macros
[9940.96 → 9942.00] for gaming cheating,
[9942.14 → 9944.14] such as entering a key combination,
[9944.14 → 9946.34] enabling a stratagem in hell divers.
[9946.34 → 9947.12] Uh,
[9947.12 → 9951.66] as much as I just roasted people for cheating in hell divers,
[9951.88 → 9952.50] uh,
[9952.50 → 9954.54] because I just think it's sad.
[9954.80 → 9955.26] Um,
[9955.26 → 9955.32] um,
[9955.32 → 9959.42] it's a EVE game.
[9959.96 → 9960.64] So like,
[9960.72 → 9961.70] I don't really care.
[9961.90 → 9962.68] I really,
[9962.82 → 9967.78] really don't think that you should do it because that's part of the game.
[9967.78 → 9970.90] And like failing the key input is part of the game.
[9970.90 → 9973.86] So I think you're robbing yourself of the experience,
[9973.86 → 9975.56] but it's a EVE game.
[9975.56 → 9976.08] So like,
[9976.64 → 9979.04] I don't care personally,
[9979.20 → 9985.50] but that's also not very democratic, and you're not a patriot.
[9987.38 → 9987.98] Got him.
[9988.30 → 9988.78] Yeah.
[9988.78 → 9989.32] All right.
[9989.34 → 9990.30] Should we do some merge messages?
[9990.56 → 9991.18] I just did one.
[9991.58 → 9991.70] Oh,
[9991.74 → 9992.12] good job.
[9994.28 → 9994.44] Hi,
[9994.52 → 9995.56] DLL is,
[9995.94 → 9996.16] Oh,
[9997.10 → 9998.62] that's what I did last year.
[9998.72 → 10000.40] I installed solar on my house,
[10000.40 → 10005.38] says Andrew Q with an EV was close to net-zero electricity.
[10005.52 → 10005.74] Linus,
[10005.80 → 10006.72] do you monitor you're solar?
[10007.14 → 10007.86] If so,
[10007.94 → 10011.94] how has your electricity usage been with an EV and many electronics?
[10012.22 → 10015.52] I actually do monitor my solar occasionally,
[10015.52 → 10016.52] uh,
[10016.52 → 10018.16] to give you some idea of how often it is.
[10018.16 → 10019.58] I forget what the app is called,
[10019.58 → 10020.56] but I do have it.
[10021.44 → 10022.82] I just need to find it.
[10024.58 → 10028.00] It's not very good in the winter because we don't get a lot of sun here in Canada,
[10028.00 → 10030.86] which is why the ROI point for solar in,
[10030.94 → 10032.56] or in Canada,
[10032.56 → 10033.94] there are some parts of Canada that gets on,
[10033.94 → 10035.26] but in Vancouver,
[10035.26 → 10039.60] we definitely don't get enough to make it make a ton of sense.
[10040.28 → 10040.52] Uh,
[10040.52 → 10041.22] but in the summer,
[10041.46 → 10041.92] in the summer,
[10041.92 → 10042.60] it's not bad.
[10044.00 → 10044.48] Dang it.
[10044.56 → 10045.90] I forget what it's called.
[10046.10 → 10049.50] It's one of those stupid apps where the name it's,
[10049.50 → 10049.94] it's not,
[10050.00 → 10050.26] you know,
[10050.26 → 10051.22] solar or,
[10051.22 → 10051.66] you know,
[10051.72 → 10053.84] energy app or anything like that.
[10053.84 → 10056.06] It just has some random stupid name.
[10056.06 → 10058.44] And I have to remember exactly what it is.
[10058.74 → 10059.10] Like,
[10059.14 → 10059.28] uh,
[10059.28 → 10059.52] okay.
[10059.60 → 10059.84] Okay.
[10059.84 → 10060.28] My pool,
[10060.38 → 10060.92] for example,
[10061.34 → 10062.28] the app for my pool,
[10062.40 → 10063.22] uh,
[10063.26 → 10065.84] instead of being called Aqua link is called I Aqua link.
[10065.92 → 10067.56] So when I'm going through all the apps,
[10067.56 → 10068.94] I don't really use all that often.
[10068.94 → 10069.98] And I have to remember,
[10070.10 → 10070.26] uh,
[10070.30 → 10070.58] right,
[10070.62 → 10070.74] right.
[10070.78 → 10076.06] The pool starts with an eye for some reason that I can't possibly imagine what it would be.
[10076.20 → 10077.44] Apparently you can rename apps.
[10077.94 → 10078.68] No way.
[10078.92 → 10079.70] I had no idea.
[10079.80 → 10079.98] Okay.
[10079.98 → 10080.70] I had no idea.
[10080.82 → 10081.92] And that is super cool.
[10082.22 → 10082.68] When bingo,
[10082.76 → 10083.34] chronicled said,
[10083.42 → 10084.08] remind Linus,
[10084.12 → 10085.50] he can rename apps in the drawer.
[10088.34 → 10089.44] I don't know how to do that.
[10090.22 → 10092.42] I don't see an obvious way to do that.
[10092.96 → 10094.30] App details in store.
[10096.18 → 10096.98] How do you do that?
[10098.50 → 10098.90] Um,
[10099.94 → 10100.76] select item.
[10100.88 → 10101.00] Okay.
[10101.06 → 10101.72] I select it.
[10101.92 → 10102.98] Depends on your launcher.
[10103.64 → 10103.96] Oh,
[10103.96 → 10104.20] okay.
[10104.22 → 10104.36] Well,
[10104.36 → 10105.38] I don't have a custom launcher.
[10106.54 → 10107.72] I cannot find this.
[10107.90 → 10108.48] I'm sorry.
[10108.54 → 10109.74] This is very embarrassing.
[10109.98 → 10110.28] I can't hold on.
[10110.28 → 10111.64] The app should bring up an edit button.
[10111.72 → 10111.88] Yeah.
[10111.94 → 10112.32] So you probably,
[10112.46 → 10112.56] yeah,
[10112.56 → 10112.82] it doesn't,
[10112.90 → 10113.42] I don't have that.
[10113.92 → 10114.24] Um,
[10115.70 → 10116.40] well,
[10116.56 → 10117.06] I give up.
[10117.28 → 10117.62] Fake news.
[10119.52 → 10119.88] Stop.
[10122.04 → 10122.94] If I find it,
[10122.96 → 10123.86] I'll let you guys know.
[10123.92 → 10124.40] In the meantime,
[10124.40 → 10126.00] we might have to move on to the other one,
[10126.00 → 10128.74] but basically on my best,
[10128.74 → 10129.26] days,
[10129.66 → 10130.12] uh,
[10130.12 → 10133.12] I'm about neutral and most days I,
[10133.18 → 10133.60] I'm not,
[10133.66 → 10134.04] I'm still,
[10134.16 → 10135.24] I'm still paying for electricity.
[10135.24 → 10135.88] Very much,
[10135.98 → 10136.40] very much.
[10136.46 → 10136.62] So,
[10136.62 → 10143.92] this is driving me absolutely bonkers right now.
[10143.92 → 10145.86] The fact that I cannot find this.
[10146.88 → 10147.28] Oh,
[10147.36 → 10148.68] it's probably not on here.
[10148.84 → 10150.26] I probably had it on my fold.
[10150.68 → 10152.98] I think I probably just haven't bothered to install it on here.
[10152.98 → 10154.22] Because that doesn't matter that much.
[10154.30 → 10154.42] Oh,
[10154.46 → 10154.78] you know what?
[10154.90 → 10157.20] I think home assistant has the tracking for it as well.
[10157.48 → 10158.22] I will double-check.
[10159.30 → 10159.70] Okay.
[10159.74 → 10160.22] Home assistant.
[10160.36 → 10160.96] Let's go.
[10161.86 → 10162.26] Energy.
[10162.72 → 10163.44] Let's go.
[10164.28 → 10164.68] Yes.
[10165.20 → 10165.60] Okay.
[10165.60 → 10169.18] So today the total was the
[10169.18 → 10171.00] um,
[10171.46 → 10172.30] wow.
[10172.38 → 10173.00] That's it.
[10173.32 → 10177.66] 6.1 kilowatt-hours from my solar would mean.
[10177.82 → 10178.32] I drew,
[10178.44 → 10178.76] uh,
[10178.76 → 10180.62] over a hundred kilowatt-hours from the grid.
[10181.20 → 10181.80] Nice.
[10182.52 → 10183.04] However,
[10183.04 → 10184.54] I could pick a summer day.
[10184.94 → 10185.54] Uh,
[10185.54 → 10187.18] let's go back to last summer.
[10187.40 → 10188.66] So I don't know,
[10188.74 → 10189.26] uh,
[10189.26 → 10191.56] arbitrarily August 23rd.
[10191.56 → 10192.08] There we go.
[10192.54 → 10193.90] So on that day,
[10193.98 → 10194.86] um,
[10195.34 → 10195.80] Oh wow.
[10195.98 → 10197.92] When I said that I was even on some days,
[10197.94 → 10202.02] that was a big lie because that was 27.7 from the solar,
[10202.14 → 10204.94] but still over a hundred from the grid.
[10205.12 → 10206.90] I have no idea what was going on that day.
[10207.84 → 10211.48] Occasionally I see big spikes where it's obvious that I was like charging my car.
[10211.88 → 10212.36] Uh,
[10212.36 → 10216.08] like here's one where I get home after work and the blue is,
[10216.20 → 10216.40] yeah,
[10216.52 → 10218.64] I'm very much charging my car.
[10219.20 → 10219.64] Um,
[10219.74 → 10220.00] yep.
[10220.32 → 10220.58] Yep.
[10220.58 → 10222.30] It makes a small difference.
[10222.44 → 10222.90] Not much.
[10223.04 → 10223.30] Okay.
[10223.86 → 10224.42] Here we go.
[10224.56 → 10224.98] What's next?
[10225.88 → 10226.08] Oh,
[10226.16 → 10226.36] right.
[10226.48 → 10227.02] Dan's not here.
[10227.70 → 10228.90] Do you want me to read them out?
[10229.28 → 10229.60] Uh,
[10229.88 → 10231.74] it's up to you.
[10231.86 → 10232.18] No,
[10232.30 → 10233.76] because right now I'm curating potentials.
[10233.82 → 10234.04] Yeah.
[10234.08 → 10234.84] Why don't you do that?
[10234.86 → 10235.20] And I'll,
[10235.20 → 10235.72] I'll read them out.
[10235.74 → 10235.98] We got,
[10236.06 → 10236.50] we got this.
[10236.82 → 10238.80] How did we ever do this by just ourselves?
[10239.30 → 10239.58] I don't,
[10239.74 → 10240.68] I think I read them out.
[10241.10 → 10241.52] I don't remember.
[10241.52 → 10243.36] We didn't have merged messages before we had a producer.
[10243.54 → 10243.88] I just mean,
[10243.94 → 10245.08] how did we do the land show before?
[10245.26 → 10246.94] I don't think the producer originally did it.
[10247.14 → 10247.34] Really?
[10247.84 → 10248.12] Yeah.
[10248.38 → 10248.56] Oh,
[10248.60 → 10249.16] I don't know.
[10249.16 → 10250.76] Uh,
[10250.76 → 10252.02] anonymous asks,
[10252.14 → 10254.82] how's Terran's Chrome PC office coming along?
[10254.90 → 10256.36] And sorry for not suggesting it.
[10256.62 → 10256.86] Uh,
[10256.90 → 10257.04] we,
[10257.16 → 10257.28] I,
[10257.44 → 10258.02] to my knowledge,
[10258.02 → 10262.62] we haven't really made any progress because I think we were trying to source a really,
[10263.24 → 10265.08] some really wild stuff for it.
[10265.18 → 10267.94] And we expect that to take a little while.
[10269.20 → 10269.68] Uh,
[10269.72 → 10270.76] Victor asks,
[10271.04 → 10274.66] can we sponsor Luke to gush about games on air?
[10274.66 → 10275.18] I mean,
[10275.18 → 10276.98] given how much he mostly hates games,
[10277.20 → 10278.10] hates games.
[10278.30 → 10279.28] I hate games.
[10279.44 → 10280.00] I mean,
[10280.36 → 10281.88] you seem to hate a lot of balls.
[10281.96 → 10283.34] There's skate three is pretty good.
[10283.98 → 10284.34] God,
[10284.34 → 10286.02] let's go.
[10286.16 → 10288.68] So if your name is Larry in studios,
[10288.68 → 10290.74] then zero dollars.
[10291.74 → 10292.14] Um,
[10292.14 → 10292.38] no,
[10292.46 → 10292.76] I mean,
[10292.80 → 10292.96] I,
[10292.96 → 10294.38] I gush about games all the time.
[10294.62 → 10296.12] I held divers is fantastic.
[10296.30 → 10297.44] Balder's gate three is perfect.
[10297.96 → 10300.24] Blotto came out of nowhere,
[10300.24 → 10301.08] uh,
[10301.08 → 10301.98] as a slave,
[10302.04 → 10302.52] the spire,
[10302.66 → 10303.24] hyper nerd.
[10303.24 → 10305.02] That game is awesome.
[10305.26 → 10306.42] Very excited about that.
[10306.54 → 10308.90] Games have been pretty good for quite a while now.
[10308.90 → 10310.40] I feel like we're out of the slump.
[10310.82 → 10312.00] This is kind of what I was talking about.
[10312.06 → 10315.24] I feel like the old big companies are honestly,
[10315.36 → 10316.62] people just kind of ignore them now.
[10316.72 → 10318.40] Like Assassin's Creed Mirage came out.
[10318.80 → 10320.46] You didn't hear people hate on it.
[10321.26 → 10324.30] You also didn't hear people like it a lot.
[10324.50 → 10325.00] Just dude,
[10325.08 → 10325.84] nobody cared.
[10326.02 → 10329.36] Even sea of thieves was in the news for like two days.
[10329.58 → 10331.08] Sea of Thieves lasted a little bit.
[10331.52 → 10332.52] Three days then.
[10332.68 → 10332.94] Yeah.
[10333.46 → 10334.68] I saw someone,
[10334.98 → 10338.84] summit like single-handedly kept that game relevant for a decent amount.
[10338.90 → 10341.30] Like one Twitch streamer was like able,
[10341.44 → 10342.66] I'm seriously though,
[10343.04 → 10344.56] because Twitch streamers can kind of do that.
[10344.62 → 10346.02] They can like to drag a game on,
[10346.14 → 10346.96] but other than summit,
[10346.96 → 10348.28] like people didn't really seem to care.
[10348.80 → 10349.24] Um,
[10350.80 → 10351.72] yeah,
[10351.84 → 10354.28] but to talk about another pirate game,
[10354.64 → 10356.20] I don't even remember the name of it right now.
[10357.18 → 10360.38] The one Ubisoft just released the quadruple a game.
[10361.48 → 10361.88] Uh,
[10363.70 → 10364.26] it's calling bones.
[10364.36 → 10364.82] There we go.
[10365.08 → 10365.78] People were like,
[10365.82 → 10366.84] including myself.
[10367.16 → 10367.34] Sorry,
[10367.42 → 10368.20] I meant skull and bones.
[10368.20 → 10369.30] I totally flubbed that.
[10369.48 → 10369.58] Yeah.
[10369.64 → 10369.88] Yeah.
[10370.16 → 10370.84] So yes,
[10370.84 → 10371.60] I completely agree.
[10371.70 → 10372.24] Not Steve Thieves.
[10372.34 → 10374.26] Steve Thieves stayed relevant for a while.
[10374.26 → 10374.62] That was for a while.
[10374.76 → 10374.96] Yeah.
[10375.38 → 10376.10] And then skull and bones.
[10376.30 → 10376.44] Yep.
[10376.62 → 10376.98] Skull and bones.
[10377.06 → 10377.28] Yeah.
[10377.44 → 10377.70] It was,
[10377.78 → 10380.76] it was like three days in my newsfeed, and then it was gone.
[10381.06 → 10381.96] Completely gone.
[10382.18 → 10382.62] Uninteresting.
[10382.84 → 10383.92] And before like,
[10384.24 → 10384.54] you know,
[10385.26 → 10387.62] Halo five comes out and people are mad for like months.
[10387.94 → 10388.14] Yeah.
[10388.40 → 10388.56] Yeah.
[10388.56 → 10389.16] Halo Infinite.
[10389.52 → 10391.40] People are mad for a long time,
[10391.40 → 10393.24] but I think people are getting to the point where they're just like,
[10393.32 → 10393.64] whatever,
[10393.84 → 10394.16] shut up.
[10394.38 → 10394.82] Indifferent.
[10394.82 → 10397.10] Now all these new companies are stepping up,
[10397.28 → 10398.48] making perfect games.
[10398.76 → 10401.70] Some indies are coming out and just killing it.
[10402.00 → 10403.36] Battle bit was a huge success.
[10403.64 → 10405.14] Bellatrix is a huge success.
[10405.60 → 10406.08] Dave,
[10406.14 → 10406.66] the diver,
[10407.04 → 10407.88] massive success.
[10408.10 → 10409.48] There are other ones that I'm forgetting right now,
[10409.54 → 10410.40] but they've been killing it.
[10410.60 → 10411.74] Ballers gate three killed it.
[10411.96 → 10413.14] Hell divers killed it.
[10413.94 → 10414.72] Elden Ring.
[10415.20 → 10415.64] Massive.
[10415.64 → 10416.04] Amazing.
[10416.04 → 10417.48] Pal world.
[10417.60 → 10418.04] Insane.
[10418.60 → 10421.38] Games are just like over and over and over again,
[10421.52 → 10423.08] breaking player limits on steam,
[10423.18 → 10424.60] breaking sales limits on steam.
[10424.68 → 10424.90] It just,
[10425.14 → 10427.86] things are actually very good right now.
[10428.00 → 10434.08] And I think it's largely studios that are not in the original big grouping
[10434.08 → 10439.32] are releasing bangers and players are more willing to buy games that aren't
[10439.32 → 10441.00] just from like these original big companies.
[10441.00 → 10446.80] The funny thing for me is even that some of the big traditional players are doing
[10446.80 → 10447.32] great.
[10447.64 → 10449.56] Like when Sony announced those layoffs,
[10449.70 → 10452.40] they also announced like record profits.
[10454.16 → 10455.38] In certain areas though,
[10456.24 → 10456.98] if I remember country,
[10457.04 → 10461.02] the layoffs that happened were with a studio that did not have record profits.
[10461.02 → 10461.98] Um,
[10462.20 → 10463.32] I think that was the four,
[10463.42 → 10464.40] I think it's for spoken.
[10464.74 → 10465.66] That's the name of the game.
[10466.48 → 10468.62] Did not do very well as far as my understanding goes.
[10468.96 → 10469.22] Um,
[10469.22 → 10471.12] and I think they laid off like that studio,
[10471.12 → 10472.86] um,
[10472.86 → 10474.14] or disperse them within the company.
[10474.22 → 10475.42] I don't necessarily know what happened.
[10475.72 → 10476.06] Um,
[10476.44 → 10477.88] what is your take on city skylines too?
[10478.18 → 10478.58] Uh,
[10478.58 → 10480.14] it's not really so much my game,
[10480.22 → 10481.58] my type of game,
[10481.58 → 10485.02] but the city skylines fans are really hardcore.
[10485.22 → 10485.50] I don't,
[10485.58 → 10486.50] I'm assuming they like it,
[10486.72 → 10487.24] but I don't know.
[10487.62 → 10488.20] They're pretty mad.
[10488.48 → 10488.70] Oh,
[10488.74 → 10488.94] okay.
[10489.96 → 10490.96] The game's super demanding.
[10491.02 → 10492.20] And in a lot of ways,
[10492.20 → 10497.46] it doesn't live up to the full experience of the previous game because it had like 10 years of modding.
[10497.66 → 10500.34] This is a rough point of those types of games.
[10500.34 → 10501.96] And if you're a fan of that type of game,
[10502.06 → 10504.12] you sort of just have to get used to it.
[10504.12 → 10504.50] It'll get there.
[10504.52 → 10505.54] This is a thing with Civ.
[10506.00 → 10507.70] When a brand new Civ game comes out,
[10507.90 → 10509.86] it's probably not as good as the last one,
[10509.86 → 10513.44] but then they'll release a couple expansions, and then it's like really sick.
[10513.58 → 10518.34] Like the next Anna game's in trouble because Anna 1800 is outstanding.
[10519.20 → 10520.92] And it got like six seasons,
[10521.02 → 10522.98] of DLC or something like that,
[10522.98 → 10526.58] which compellingly added to the game.
[10526.58 → 10527.14] Very good DLC.
[10527.14 → 10528.78] Not just cosmetic crap or whatever.
[10528.78 → 10530.34] That you like want because it's great.
[10530.80 → 10533.68] That like dramatically improves the game.
[10534.12 → 10534.26] Yeah.
[10534.34 → 10534.78] Like the new,
[10534.84 → 10535.76] the first expansion,
[10535.88 → 10537.20] the new world is awesome.
[10537.40 → 10537.64] Amazing.
[10537.74 → 10538.40] It's a whole new world.
[10538.66 → 10538.80] Yeah.
[10538.80 → 10539.56] A whole new world to its part.
[10539.56 → 10541.00] The Arctic expansion is sick.
[10541.14 → 10541.30] Yeah.
[10541.30 → 10541.74] The
[10541.82 → 10542.02] uh,
[10542.02 → 10543.96] whatever that jungle kind of one is,
[10543.96 → 10544.58] is great.
[10544.88 → 10545.14] Yeah.
[10545.22 → 10545.62] Um,
[10546.58 → 10548.68] and so Anna whatever is coming next,
[10549.02 → 10549.36] it,
[10549.44 → 10551.94] it's going to suck by comparison.
[10552.08 → 10552.30] Yeah.
[10552.64 → 10553.86] For probably a while.
[10553.98 → 10556.08] I like playing snow runner with my dad.
[10556.54 → 10557.10] Uh,
[10557.10 → 10559.68] they're releasing a game called expeditions,
[10559.76 → 10560.74] a mud runner game.
[10561.62 → 10562.34] And like,
[10562.72 → 10563.04] uh,
[10563.20 → 10563.72] yeah,
[10563.94 → 10566.94] it's probably not going to be very good for like a while.
[10567.56 → 10568.40] And that's okay.
[10568.50 → 10569.46] Because it'll get there.
[10569.56 → 10569.80] I,
[10569.86 → 10571.12] I believe it'll be all right.
[10571.32 → 10572.30] Civ five greater than Civ six.
[10572.44 → 10573.58] I also believe this,
[10573.64 → 10574.88] but I think that's a preference thing.
[10574.96 → 10575.94] I think you and I,
[10576.04 → 10577.76] we probably don't like the districts.
[10578.02 → 10581.28] That's the only reason why I don't like Civ six is I'm not so into the districts,
[10581.28 → 10584.14] but I also know people that love Civ six.
[10584.30 → 10585.46] So it is what it is.
[10585.58 → 10585.68] Yeah.
[10585.70 → 10588.62] And it's one of those things where everything we're saying is kind of a generalization.
[10588.62 → 10592.50] Like there are going to be preferred entries in the series,
[10592.50 → 10594.00] but we just mean in general,
[10594.00 → 10598.54] when you follow-up something that had many years of bug fixes and optimization and,
[10598.64 → 10600.66] and in some cases,
[10600.84 → 10601.30] mods,
[10601.42 → 10602.16] extra content,
[10602.72 → 10605.54] you can't like GTA six,
[10605.66 → 10606.34] man,
[10606.44 → 10608.12] no matter how good that game is,
[10608.84 → 10610.38] it will experience is going to be,
[10610.48 → 10616.72] it will not live up to GTA five online or GTA online.
[10616.82 → 10617.58] I guess they call it,
[10617.58 → 10618.58] but you can,
[10618.66 → 10619.32] you know what I mean?
[10619.32 → 10620.76] The online experience that,
[10620.76 → 10625.78] that GTA five ultimately morphed into that is far beyond what I certainly,
[10625.78 → 10626.56] I expected.
[10627.28 → 10628.30] Pit boy is saying,
[10628.38 → 10630.60] give us a little feeder on the star field review vid.
[10630.68 → 10631.32] This is it.
[10631.52 → 10631.96] Actually,
[10632.08 → 10633.26] the star field review vid.
[10633.32 → 10634.40] I'm going to talk about star field.
[10634.50 → 10635.38] Almost not at all.
[10635.80 → 10637.24] The that's a closed book.
[10637.32 → 10638.08] The game's garbage.
[10638.74 → 10639.18] Um,
[10639.18 → 10639.48] got him.
[10640.02 → 10641.40] What I'm going to be talking about is,
[10641.46 → 10642.26] is this stuff,
[10642.26 → 10643.12] um,
[10643.12 → 10644.30] is the industry is moving.
[10644.30 → 10648.58] And as much as I'm going to sit here and mourn the
[10648.58 → 10650.92] the loss of some of my like favourite things,
[10650.92 → 10651.88] um,
[10652.24 → 10656.12] like I do not expect the next Elder Scrolls game will be like worth playing at all,
[10656.12 → 10658.76] which sucks.
[10659.36 → 10660.20] That's bold,
[10660.20 → 10664.32] but unless they make dramatic changes in that studio,
[10664.32 → 10665.28] it's not going to happen.
[10666.28 → 10667.00] Like I,
[10667.20 → 10668.36] I don't know.
[10668.74 → 10669.22] Um,
[10669.22 → 10673.28] but there's sick games coming out that are really fun.
[10674.48 → 10677.22] I'm having a great time playing new stuff.
[10677.38 → 10677.74] My,
[10677.84 → 10678.82] my era of like,
[10679.30 → 10680.54] I played Borrowing.
[10680.68 → 10682.56] I went back and played the games before Borrowing.
[10682.68 → 10683.52] I played oblivion.
[10683.68 → 10684.54] All like this is,
[10684.62 → 10685.28] Oh my God.
[10685.28 → 10686.52] All of these things are amazing.
[10686.52 → 10689.70] And I can just like guarantee that the next one coming out is going to be sick.
[10689.92 → 10691.22] That's kind of over,
[10691.38 → 10693.58] but that doesn't mean that good games are over.
[10694.38 → 10696.86] So are you ever going to finish Final Fantasy six?
[10697.08 → 10697.38] Yes,
[10697.38 → 10698.70] I will.
[10698.70 → 10700.54] I'm trying to right now figure out,
[10700.54 → 10701.12] uh,
[10701.18 → 10703.34] why my computer is blue screening multiple times a day.
[10703.66 → 10704.14] What?
[10704.26 → 10705.38] It's having problems again?
[10705.60 → 10705.82] New,
[10706.00 → 10707.20] completely new problems.
[10708.14 → 10709.40] Raid port zero,
[10709.70 → 10709.96] some,
[10710.14 → 10710.44] something,
[10710.62 → 10710.80] something.
[10711.30 → 10711.58] Yeah,
[10711.62 → 10712.08] I don't know.
[10713.02 → 10714.00] Very confusing.
[10714.00 → 10715.52] Did you get moss in your fan?
[10716.30 → 10718.88] It doesn't seem to be related to overheating.
[10719.62 → 10720.54] That's weird.
[10720.74 → 10721.12] Yeah.
[10722.04 → 10722.52] Okay.
[10722.76 → 10723.96] I'm still trying to figure it out.
[10724.06 → 10724.52] All right.
[10724.66 → 10724.94] Well,
[10725.42 → 10725.80] bummer.
[10726.32 → 10727.12] AMD drivers?
[10728.00 → 10728.48] No,
[10728.48 → 10729.34] he's on NVIDIA now.
[10729.34 → 10730.86] Unless they're talking about the CPU.
[10731.86 → 10732.04] Oh,
[10732.08 → 10732.28] I mean,
[10732.32 → 10732.62] that's,
[10732.68 → 10733.40] that's possible,
[10733.40 → 10734.20] but unlikely.
[10735.04 → 10736.26] Is cursed with personal PCs?
[10736.42 → 10738.90] I wasn't until the AMD challenge started.
[10738.98 → 10739.76] I never had any problems,
[10739.90 → 10742.26] but now I'm,
[10742.26 → 10743.82] I'm not on an AMD car anymore.
[10743.82 → 10744.72] So I can't talk about that.
[10744.82 → 10745.44] Chad asks,
[10745.52 → 10745.62] Hey,
[10745.66 → 10750.18] DLL alien special edition is the best aliens specialist.
[10750.36 → 10750.50] Oh,
[10750.54 → 10750.72] okay.
[10750.78 → 10751.00] Yeah.
[10751.38 → 10751.58] Yeah.
[10751.58 → 10752.54] cargo pants.
[10752.54 → 10752.86] When?
[10753.86 → 10754.26] Um,
[10754.38 → 10755.30] I don't know.
[10756.10 → 10757.28] We are at,
[10757.48 → 10757.60] Oh,
[10757.62 → 10761.68] I should say we're at least two to three months out because we haven't started mass production yet,
[10761.68 → 10764.60] but they're going to be pretty similar to this, and they're not going to be cheap.
[10764.68 → 10766.70] All the pockets and everything ended up,
[10766.70 → 10767.10] um,
[10767.36 → 10771.68] significantly contributing to the cost of this particular garment.
[10772.02 → 10776.22] And our order quantity is not super high because we haven't had like a
[10776.22 → 10776.58] a
[10776.58 → 10779.34] a smash hit in pants yet.
[10779.44 → 10782.60] And so we're taking a fairly conservative approach to ordering.
[10782.60 → 10785.34] So there'll be a bit of a low volume tax,
[10785.58 → 10787.00] but they're really nice.
[10787.08 → 10788.16] I really liked them.
[10789.66 → 10790.10] Um,
[10790.94 → 10791.58] Richard says,
[10791.66 → 10793.46] thanks LTT and team question for Linus.
[10793.48 → 10794.12] If he gets it,
[10794.30 → 10795.82] what treats do you like to give your cats?
[10795.82 → 10796.18] Oh,
[10796.22 → 10797.00] we're terrible.
[10797.08 → 10797.28] We,
[10797.42 → 10797.74] uh,
[10797.86 → 10799.58] we just give them like friskier,
[10799.66 → 10803.84] like the name brand ones that are probably full of garbage and going to kill them or whatever.
[10804.38 → 10804.76] Um,
[10804.76 → 10806.02] we don't give them to them often,
[10806.02 → 10806.64] but they,
[10806.72 → 10807.34] they do like them.
[10807.40 → 10811.24] Sometimes we'll put them in like 3d printed stimulus toys that are fun to play with.
[10811.24 → 10811.72] And they like,
[10811.72 → 10812.78] can try to get it out of it.
[10813.14 → 10813.50] Uh,
[10813.50 → 10814.00] but I,
[10814.06 → 10815.44] I like giving them catnip,
[10815.60 → 10816.88] even though I know you're not supposed to,
[10817.08 → 10817.62] you're not supposed to.
[10817.84 → 10818.14] Yeah.
[10818.14 → 10818.44] It's,
[10818.54 → 10818.68] I don't know.
[10818.72 → 10819.14] It's like bad.
[10819.30 → 10819.64] It's like,
[10819.68 → 10820.20] it's drugs,
[10820.28 → 10820.38] right?
[10820.42 → 10821.90] It like messes them up a little bit.
[10822.76 → 10823.02] I don't know.
[10823.04 → 10823.32] It's funny.
[10823.32 → 10824.34] It's funny.
[10825.12 → 10826.00] It's hilarious.
[10826.34 → 10828.88] They get all weird and affectionate, and they like roll around.
[10829.10 → 10829.82] That's the stuff.
[10830.14 → 10831.74] So it's E for cats.
[10831.88 → 10832.10] Yeah.
[10832.22 → 10832.44] I don't know.
[10833.14 → 10833.50] Um,
[10833.86 → 10834.02] yeah.
[10834.26 → 10834.66] Temptations.
[10834.72 → 10837.24] That's the one J sit on in float plane chat.
[10838.30 → 10838.62] Um,
[10839.82 → 10842.18] are the 3d printed toys safe for them to be chewing and licking?
[10842.30 → 10842.42] They,
[10842.44 → 10842.74] they don't,
[10842.82 → 10843.44] they're not dogs.
[10843.76 → 10844.46] Like they're,
[10844.50 → 10845.62] they're like fidget toys.
[10845.62 → 10847.52] Like they have like spiny bits, or they have little like,
[10847.56 → 10848.08] uh,
[10848.08 → 10850.04] thing sliders that they can try to get the
[10850.04 → 10850.26] the
[10850.26 → 10851.02] the food underneath.
[10851.24 → 10851.36] It's,
[10851.40 → 10851.72] it's fine.
[10851.72 → 10854.00] Apparently the nip is perfectly fine.
[10854.40 → 10854.76] Uh,
[10854.80 → 10856.56] some people are saying occasionally it's fine.
[10856.64 → 10857.42] Natural is fine.
[10857.50 → 10857.64] Yeah.
[10857.66 → 10858.04] I don't know.
[10858.48 → 10858.98] I don't know.
[10859.04 → 10859.32] Whatever.
[10859.50 → 10861.80] Someone told me at some point that it's not the best.
[10861.86 → 10862.66] I'm going to give it to them anyway,
[10862.66 → 10863.62] because I don't give a fuck.
[10864.00 → 10864.92] So there you go.
[10865.92 → 10866.28] Sorry.
[10866.44 → 10866.66] Sorry.
[10866.78 → 10867.16] Bad pet,
[10867.32 → 10868.02] bad pet dad.
[10868.02 → 10869.02] Uh,
[10869.24 → 10870.02] Roderick says,
[10870.14 → 10874.88] if you were forced to use a monitor where all of its specs were as low as they can go,
[10875.02 → 10878.64] but you could choose one spec to be top of the line,
[10878.98 → 10880.72] which would it be?
[10881.50 → 10881.94] Size,
[10882.14 → 10882.82] refresh rate,
[10883.16 → 10883.98] colour accuracy,
[10884.66 → 10885.54] et cetera.
[10887.26 → 10887.62] Ooh,
[10887.98 → 10889.44] it depends on what I'm doing.
[10889.62 → 10889.76] Yeah.
[10889.88 → 10890.54] If it's for gaming,
[10890.54 → 10892.90] it's going to have to be a top of the line refresh rate.
[10892.90 → 10895.84] But am I allowed to also have top of the line pixel response times?
[10895.84 → 10898.64] Cause if I have the fastest refresh rate and trash pixel response times,
[10898.70 → 10899.20] that'll suck.
[10899.30 → 10900.22] Everything's just a blur.
[10900.40 → 10901.90] Then if I have to pick one,
[10902.14 → 10903.70] then it would be pixel response times.
[10906.22 → 10908.00] Unless it's for anything other than gaming,
[10908.00 → 10909.26] in which case it's going to be colour.
[10910.08 → 10910.28] Ooh,
[10910.28 → 10910.80] but size,
[10911.02 → 10911.26] colour.
[10911.78 → 10911.96] Ooh,
[10911.98 → 10912.46] but size.
[10912.58 → 10912.88] Hold on.
[10913.26 → 10914.06] Minimum size.
[10914.26 → 10915.18] How small is that?
[10915.50 → 10915.90] Yeah.
[10916.06 → 10916.34] I don't know.
[10916.40 → 10916.58] I mean,
[10916.64 → 10918.50] these days I would say like these days,
[10918.58 → 10918.84] probably.
[10918.96 → 10919.10] Yeah.
[10919.10 → 10920.14] Probably something like that.
[10921.78 → 10923.52] It's probably not going to be size then though.
[10924.94 → 10925.34] Uh,
[10925.34 → 10925.82] garage,
[10925.84 → 10926.42] broad asks,
[10926.52 → 10929.00] have you looked at the plug in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica?
[10929.06 → 10929.26] Yeah.
[10929.40 → 10932.42] I almost got it when we bought our odyssey.
[10932.54 → 10934.06] It was coming soon.
[10934.48 → 10939.78] And I didn't want to be the first person to buy a Chrysler all new model.
[10940.78 → 10941.76] So I was like,
[10941.86 → 10943.58] this looks super cool.
[10943.76 → 10945.16] This is right up my alley.
[10945.26 → 10945.96] Plug in hybrid.
[10946.26 → 10947.68] I could do a lot of my,
[10947.96 → 10948.36] you know,
[10948.48 → 10951.46] just putting about dropping kids off at lessons on electric.
[10952.02 → 10952.46] Uh,
[10952.46 → 10953.52] totally my jam,
[10953.64 → 10953.86] right?
[10954.06 → 10955.14] Chevy volt guy.
[10955.98 → 10956.46] Um,
[10956.46 → 10957.66] but it's a Chrysler.
[10957.66 → 10960.78] And this is the very first one.
[10960.92 → 10963.98] I don't even know if they had a plug in hybrid before that.
[10964.52 → 10965.00] Uh,
[10965.00 → 10965.26] no,
[10965.32 → 10966.36] they must've because,
[10966.54 → 10966.98] um,
[10967.44 → 10968.14] they're,
[10968.30 → 10969.88] they're also under General Motors,
[10970.02 → 10972.44] but I don't know that Chrysler specifically had done anything.
[10974.44 → 10974.96] Yeah,
[10974.96 → 10975.48] I,
[10975.48 → 10976.10] I don't,
[10976.10 → 10977.24] I don't believe in,
[10977.36 → 10978.70] I don't believe in first gen,
[10979.00 → 10981.12] even an established product line.
[10981.26 → 10982.72] I don't want a new,
[10982.92 → 10983.12] a breath,
[10983.22 → 10983.82] an all new.
[10984.34 → 10985.42] I don't want an all new.
[10985.62 → 10988.10] I want the facelift or,
[10988.42 → 10991.28] or I want the last one before the facelift or the second one after the
[10991.28 → 10991.44] face.
[10991.44 → 10992.98] I forget what like the ones are,
[10993.06 → 10994.32] but I don't want an all new.
[10994.40 → 10995.34] I know that for sure.
[10996.92 → 10997.32] Apparently,
[10997.42 → 10997.62] no,
[10997.70 → 10998.52] Chrysler's not GM.
[10998.60 → 10999.18] It's Fiat Chrysler.
[10999.28 → 10999.66] That's right.
[10999.78 → 10999.98] Sorry,
[11000.08 → 11000.26] sorry,
[11000.34 → 11000.48] sorry,
[11000.54 → 11000.70] sorry.
[11000.76 → 11001.04] My bad.
[11001.28 → 11004.76] I think there's one dealership locally that does Chrysler and GM.
[11004.96 → 11007.16] And so I get that confused sometimes.
[11007.34 → 11007.48] Yeah.
[11007.58 → 11008.06] So I,
[11008.10 → 11008.58] I would just,
[11008.96 → 11009.28] nah,
[11010.10 → 11010.48] nah,
[11010.72 → 11011.24] I was not,
[11011.30 → 11012.12] I was not into that.
[11014.02 → 11014.42] Oops.
[11015.94 → 11016.48] What's up?
[11017.18 → 11020.00] I just curated something that there's like two of the same thing for.
[11020.16 → 11020.54] So nice.
[11020.78 → 11022.24] Anonymous says being water-resistant.
[11022.24 → 11026.34] How does the LTT hat hold up to head sweat compared to the standard version?
[11027.02 → 11027.46] Well,
[11027.52 → 11031.48] what I would imagine is that it would not pass through it as easily,
[11031.48 → 11033.96] but I would have to get back to you on that.
[11033.96 → 11034.60] Um,
[11034.64 → 11038.78] I have no idea how to do anything with respect to following this up.
[11039.38 → 11043.48] So maybe someone will see it, and we will update the product page at some
[11043.48 → 11043.82] point.
[11044.20 → 11049.86] But I would say that if you sweat a lot and your main concern when it comes to
[11049.86 → 11051.76] your head getting wet is from the inside,
[11051.76 → 11054.90] then you should just get the regular cotton one and save yourself 20 bucks.
[11056.22 → 11059.44] And it'll be like very breathable and that'll be good.
[11059.82 → 11060.26] Uh,
[11060.26 → 11063.46] Michael says if the government forced you into one of the currently vacant,
[11063.46 → 11066.40] non-tech focused public service jobs,
[11066.52 → 11068.34] what would you be excited to do?
[11069.78 → 11070.34] Forced to.
[11070.38 → 11073.74] And what side jobs would you do to actually pay the bills?
[11074.56 → 11075.96] So I'd be a teacher.
[11076.20 → 11077.42] He'd be a firefighter.
[11077.78 → 11078.60] Save you the trouble.
[11078.82 → 11079.06] Thanks.
[11079.06 → 11080.66] As for side jobs.
[11081.30 → 11081.70] Um,
[11082.82 → 11083.26] man,
[11083.32 → 11084.02] I feel like,
[11084.08 → 11084.40] uh,
[11084.60 → 11085.26] you know what?
[11085.26 → 11086.48] I was looking into this recently.
[11086.48 → 11091.72] I feel like I'd figure out stuff where I can buy a small piece of equipment and then turn
[11091.72 → 11093.48] that into like a recurring profit at home.
[11093.70 → 11093.98] A rental.
[11094.34 → 11094.44] Yeah.
[11094.44 → 11094.84] Um,
[11095.28 → 11095.56] no,
[11095.64 → 11098.16] actually what I had in mind was more along the lines of like,
[11098.20 → 11098.70] you can buy,
[11098.84 → 11101.40] there's this really weird Chinese company,
[11101.54 → 11101.82] Vivo,
[11101.82 → 11104.22] and they have kind of everything.
[11104.28 → 11108.62] Like they have ultrasonic cleaners, and they have like super high pressure compressors.
[11108.92 → 11110.36] I don't know how trustworthy they are.
[11110.44 → 11111.30] Like the reviews are like,
[11111.36 → 11111.58] Oh yeah,
[11111.58 → 11113.20] this compressor like works pretty good.
[11113.20 → 11113.92] As long as you,
[11114.46 → 11114.72] you know,
[11114.80 → 11117.86] make sure you're like supervising it really carefully.
[11117.86 → 11119.12] Cause otherwise it'll explode.
[11119.12 → 11121.44] If it goes too high, and it doesn't have a safety cut off.
[11121.48 → 11125.00] And also like I had to redo the oil in it when it first arrived.
[11125.02 → 11126.36] Cause it like wasn't sealed right.
[11126.52 → 11126.92] And like,
[11127.24 → 11128.10] uh,
[11128.12 → 11128.44] anyway,
[11128.54 → 11129.72] um,
[11129.78 → 11130.84] but I was gonna,
[11131.00 → 11133.20] before I realized how dangerous that thing was,
[11133.20 → 11134.50] I was thinking,
[11134.60 → 11134.68] Oh,
[11134.68 → 11137.14] that would be like a cool side hustle for like my kid.
[11137.44 → 11138.02] It's like,
[11138.10 → 11138.34] Hey,
[11138.56 → 11138.80] you know,
[11138.84 → 11139.06] here,
[11139.16 → 11140.20] learn to run a business.
[11140.70 → 11141.10] Um,
[11141.16 → 11141.62] I will,
[11141.76 → 11142.66] I will invest,
[11142.82 → 11143.34] you know,
[11143.34 → 11145.76] the cost of this high pressure compressor thing.
[11145.94 → 11148.46] You're responsible for having a web presence.
[11148.46 → 11149.34] And for,
[11149.34 → 11150.26] uh,
[11150.38 → 11151.10] handling,
[11151.50 → 11151.84] you know,
[11151.90 → 11153.30] client communications and,
[11153.38 → 11156.08] and for actually fulfilling people's tank filling requests.
[11156.08 → 11158.68] And you could use it to fill probably not scuba tanks,
[11158.68 → 11160.38] but you could use it to fill airsoft,
[11160.38 → 11161.58] uh,
[11161.58 → 11163.30] or like air gun or paintball gun,
[11163.70 → 11164.18] uh,
[11164.26 → 11165.36] high pressure air tanks.
[11165.80 → 11169.50] And so I could see myself doing stuff like that.
[11169.50 → 11171.76] So making small investments like,
[11171.76 → 11172.02] uh,
[11172.02 → 11172.86] into a badminton.
[11172.86 → 11172.98] Yeah.
[11173.04 → 11173.16] Yeah.
[11173.16 → 11176.48] These guys into like a badminton stringing machine.
[11176.60 → 11177.28] Um,
[11177.28 → 11178.42] and then streaming,
[11178.70 → 11178.96] streaming,
[11179.14 → 11179.40] uh,
[11179.44 → 11180.20] badminton streaming,
[11180.28 → 11183.58] badminton stringing machine and stringing people's rackets for them and stuff like that.
[11183.62 → 11183.82] And man,
[11183.88 → 11184.96] these guys got everything.
[11185.56 → 11185.92] So,
[11185.92 → 11186.24] uh,
[11186.24 → 11186.36] yeah,
[11186.36 → 11187.24] don't go to cleaning equipment.
[11187.24 → 11188.30] Just go to like the main,
[11188.64 → 11189.42] the main site.
[11189.72 → 11191.52] It's like super weird company,
[11191.62 → 11191.86] man.
[11191.90 → 11192.12] Like,
[11192.14 → 11193.90] is that a milking machine or like what the
[11193.98 → 11195.74] what the fuck am I even looking at here?
[11196.02 → 11197.30] Is that a lawnmower?
[11198.02 → 11198.94] I don't even know.
[11198.94 → 11199.52] What is this?
[11199.52 → 11200.24] I don't even know.
[11200.24 → 11200.98] It's like a still.
[11201.14 → 11201.78] I don't even know.
[11201.88 → 11203.40] Prices as low as $68,
[11203.78 → 11204.52] a curb ramp.
[11205.10 → 11205.54] Like,
[11206.00 → 11208.08] would I trust a Jack from these guys?
[11208.10 → 11209.34] I would not trust this.
[11209.40 → 11209.56] Right?
[11209.66 → 11209.88] Like,
[11210.52 → 11211.74] the lowest price ever.
[11211.92 → 11212.08] Oh,
[11212.12 → 11212.34] good.
[11212.80 → 11215.02] I don't know if I want that from a Jack.
[11215.28 → 11215.58] Yeah.
[11215.58 → 11215.66] Yeah.
[11218.40 → 11218.96] Yeah.
[11219.06 → 11219.24] Weird,
[11219.38 → 11219.90] weird company,
[11220.02 → 11220.18] dude.
[11222.60 → 11223.68] Multi effect,
[11223.88 → 11224.92] deep detox,
[11225.12 → 11226.52] temperature control and timer,
[11226.72 → 11230.08] foldable and portable sauna blanket for infrared heating.
[11232.04 → 11232.56] Okay.
[11233.06 → 11234.14] Jaws 14 said,
[11234.20 → 11236.74] I literally had their sauna heaters open in Chrome already.
[11237.54 → 11238.02] Yeah.
[11238.06 → 11239.58] They just have some everything.
[11240.42 → 11240.88] Um,
[11241.28 → 11241.68] random.
[11243.00 → 11243.48] Archive.
[11243.48 → 11244.78] anonymous says,
[11244.88 → 11246.16] Hey Dan and the talent.
[11248.84 → 11251.86] What is the most comfortable LTT merch to wear while travelling?
[11251.98 → 11257.66] My wife and I are flying to the Maritimes in April to see the total solar eclipse and want to get us some merch.
[11258.66 → 11259.58] While flying,
[11259.68 → 11259.88] man,
[11259.94 → 11260.16] I,
[11260.30 → 11262.48] I would take the dropout.
[11263.18 → 11265.50] That hoodie is awesome.
[11265.62 → 11267.04] The dropout is just so comfortable.
[11267.24 → 11267.54] And I mean,
[11267.54 → 11272.68] if you're going maximum comfort, and you just don't give an about what you look like,
[11273.16 → 11274.74] pick up the pajama pants.
[11275.20 → 11275.34] Yeah.
[11275.48 → 11276.80] They are so comfortable.
[11277.06 → 11277.48] So that,
[11277.62 → 11277.78] yeah.
[11277.86 → 11278.94] I second both of those.
[11279.04 → 11279.20] Yeah.
[11279.22 → 11281.06] Like if I just wanted maximum comfort,
[11281.16 → 11282.72] I would probably just go that route.
[11282.78 → 11282.94] I mean,
[11282.94 → 11285.00] there's always the onesie if you're totally shameless.
[11285.00 → 11286.36] What's the scenario that you're in?
[11286.42 → 11286.68] Is this,
[11286.76 → 11287.36] they're flying,
[11287.50 → 11287.78] flying.
[11287.96 → 11288.16] Yeah.
[11288.62 → 11291.10] You can have some printing issues with the
[11291.18 → 11292.36] with the
[11292.36 → 11293.10] the
[11293.32 → 11293.80] yeah,
[11293.84 → 11296.62] but you could wear the Merino underwear and that would keep the print.
[11296.86 → 11297.32] There you go.
[11297.38 → 11297.78] Contained.
[11298.04 → 11298.36] Uh,
[11299.36 → 11300.30] well,
[11300.52 → 11301.00] depending.
[11301.00 → 11306.34] Get help.
[11307.84 → 11310.78] You really got to brag about that on a live stream.
[11311.00 → 11311.68] What's wrong with you?
[11311.70 → 11312.42] What's your problem?
[11312.66 → 11313.10] That's all.
[11313.16 → 11313.68] What's your problem?
[11313.72 → 11315.44] I just don't wear those in public places.
[11315.64 → 11315.82] Yeah.
[11315.88 → 11316.42] You wear them to work.
[11316.42 → 11316.92] It's not,
[11317.02 → 11317.32] uh,
[11317.32 → 11317.98] not anymore.
[11318.16 → 11318.36] Yeah.
[11318.42 → 11318.68] Well,
[11318.78 → 11319.90] because I told you not to.
[11320.10 → 11320.26] Yeah.
[11320.56 → 11321.08] Uh,
[11321.08 → 11321.38] okay.
[11321.64 → 11322.42] Nathaniel says,
[11323.04 → 11324.82] Linus or Luke tried quick champions.
[11324.82 → 11327.38] I stand by being the best shooter around at the moment.
[11327.52 → 11328.38] Similar vibe to halo,
[11328.50 → 11330.52] but much faster movement and no aim assist.
[11331.00 → 11331.76] I haven't tried it.
[11332.00 → 11332.94] I would probably enjoy it.
[11332.98 → 11335.90] I love quake, and it's Quaker.
[11336.00 → 11336.32] Privatives.
[11338.74 → 11339.14] Yeah.
[11339.30 → 11339.98] I feel the same way.
[11340.30 → 11341.02] Ryan S says,
[11341.12 → 11344.46] I was able to play super checks with my fiancé for the first time this week.
[11344.70 → 11346.54] She was playing it similar to foosball,
[11346.72 → 11347.20] all power,
[11347.28 → 11347.92] no finesse.
[11348.54 → 11348.98] Um,
[11349.42 → 11353.10] any tips for how to consistently win defence,
[11354.20 → 11354.88] defence,
[11355.70 → 11356.58] defence,
[11356.78 → 11358.08] defence.
[11358.76 → 11359.20] Um,
[11359.20 → 11360.86] it's all about cutting down the angles.
[11361.00 → 11361.70] So you,
[11361.70 → 11365.86] you basically have to look at whatever part of your net is exposed.
[11365.86 → 11369.26] You put your goalie in whatever the most likely spot they are to hit is.
[11369.36 → 11373.64] And then you get a player in between the puck and the rest of the net.
[11373.74 → 11374.24] And you can,
[11374.80 → 11374.98] our,
[11375.14 → 11379.20] our games tend to be very tight checking games,
[11379.20 → 11380.00] uh,
[11380.04 → 11380.22] with,
[11380.56 → 11380.80] there was,
[11380.90 → 11385.58] I specifically remember one conversation that we had that you,
[11385.58 → 11389.22] after the conversation were semi regretting having,
[11389.22 → 11391.96] where we were discussing how to block certain shots.
[11392.84 → 11393.32] Um,
[11393.36 → 11394.02] and that,
[11394.10 → 11395.16] that conversation,
[11395.16 → 11399.82] I think was quite the inflection point in like the quality of overall gameplay.
[11399.82 → 11400.28] Yeah.
[11400.28 → 11402.42] Because we went back and forth a bit on like,
[11402.46 → 11404.80] I outfitted him for quite a long time.
[11405.02 → 11405.36] Yeah.
[11405.36 → 11406.12] And then,
[11406.12 → 11409.02] because neither of us is that into that,
[11409.54 → 11410.04] um,
[11410.50 → 11412.46] whenever he out met as me at something,
[11412.46 → 11414.76] he explains what he's doing.
[11414.82 → 11417.24] And whenever I out met a at something,
[11417.24 → 11418.96] we both just generally want to be better.
[11419.06 → 11419.58] We'll win.
[11419.72 → 11419.98] We'll,
[11420.08 → 11421.14] we'll win some games.
[11421.28 → 11421.50] Yeah.
[11421.58 → 11422.92] If we figure something out.
[11423.00 → 11423.26] Yeah.
[11423.26 → 11424.32] But then we'll be like,
[11424.56 → 11424.82] Hey,
[11424.92 → 11426.22] once you've kind of got it on lock,
[11426.36 → 11428.60] the reason I'm scoring with my left-winger,
[11428.74 → 11433.46] like every game all the time is because you're not,
[11433.62 → 11433.90] you,
[11434.02 → 11436.86] you're moving this guy this way, and you should be moving him this way.
[11437.32 → 11437.76] Um,
[11437.82 → 11445.56] nowadays you like you either have to get lucky, and you just like start hitting hard and hoping it like bounces off something.
[11445.56 → 11446.46] There's some of that.
[11446.54 → 11447.16] There's some of that.
[11447.20 → 11448.50] There's some of that in real hockey too.
[11448.62 → 11448.98] A hundred percent.
[11449.06 → 11449.18] Uh,
[11449.18 → 11450.36] or you have to,
[11450.58 → 11450.84] you could,
[11450.98 → 11451.18] man,
[11451.20 → 11452.12] you have to make a good play.
[11452.60 → 11452.78] Yeah.
[11452.78 → 11455.32] Try to do a pass.
[11455.82 → 11456.22] Um,
[11456.22 → 11457.14] so instead of just like,
[11457.22 → 11458.02] I have the puck,
[11458.04 → 11459.20] I shoot it at the net.
[11459.40 → 11459.62] Yeah.
[11459.72 → 11460.12] Um,
[11460.34 → 11461.00] try to like,
[11461.26 → 11461.54] you know,
[11461.90 → 11464.24] they're guarding one angle because your player has the puck.
[11464.24 → 11465.16] Instead of shooting at the net,
[11465.26 → 11468.44] pass it to your other one and be ready and smack it right when it gets to you.
[11468.46 → 11470.26] So they don't have time to react and move their,
[11470.44 → 11471.48] move their players and stuff.
[11471.88 → 11472.16] Also,
[11472.28 → 11474.04] you just generally got to work on your muscle memory.
[11474.56 → 11474.88] Uh,
[11475.00 → 11475.96] manage your goalie.
[11476.20 → 11479.04] That's a big one is whenever the pucks on this side,
[11479.12 → 11481.18] get your goalie to that side and then proceed to play.
[11481.22 → 11482.10] And then when it moves to the other side,
[11482.10 → 11482.86] get it over there,
[11483.20 → 11483.66] get back,
[11483.82 → 11487.82] just keep your goalie so that he's best cutting down on the angles.
[11488.48 → 11488.70] Yeah.
[11489.58 → 11490.02] Daniela.
[11490.42 → 11490.78] Hey,
[11490.90 → 11491.30] Lane,
[11491.40 → 11492.42] Lindsay and Delilah.
[11493.42 → 11495.44] As a float plane subscriber for a long time,
[11495.52 → 11499.62] I feel like I've missed out on all the Dennis ads that appear in videos.
[11499.86 → 11502.44] Could we get a float plane compilation of them?
[11502.54 → 11503.12] Love this show.
[11503.20 → 11504.06] That's a perfect idea.
[11504.06 → 11505.16] Could be really fun too.
[11505.26 → 11508.78] Is like Dennis going over like his like favourite top five ones or something.
[11508.78 → 11509.10] Yeah.
[11509.34 → 11509.90] Um,
[11510.48 → 11510.90] that's a
[11510.94 → 11511.28] that's a
[11511.36 → 11512.74] that's a perfect idea.
[11512.88 → 11513.88] I will,
[11514.10 → 11517.00] I will send that to Artie.
[11517.00 → 11518.44] Um,
[11518.94 → 11524.54] Dennis presents his favourite Dennis ads,
[11524.78 → 11525.16] period.
[11527.22 → 11537.04] Idea for a float plane exclusive where Dennis acts as the host and shows them some of the best creative sponsor spots that he's done because they don't see them.
[11537.04 → 11540.60] All right.
[11540.76 → 11540.98] Yeah,
[11540.98 → 11541.64] that's a perfect idea.
[11543.22 → 11543.94] Antonio says,
[11544.04 → 11544.18] Hey,
[11544.32 → 11544.70] Linux,
[11544.92 → 11548.86] Luke Skywalker and dirty Dan with the retirement of Matt Pat.
[11549.02 → 11555.50] What are your thoughts on YouTubers retiring and the impact theorists have had on the gaming community and game development?
[11556.30 → 11558.22] So thoughts on YouTubers retiring,
[11558.42 → 11558.66] man,
[11558.78 → 11559.14] I,
[11559.26 → 11559.62] uh,
[11560.34 → 11562.16] I've been tempted myself many times.
[11562.24 → 11562.44] I mean,
[11562.44 → 11562.72] I've,
[11562.80 → 11563.52] I've said guys,
[11563.52 → 11565.14] I'm not doing this for the money anymore.
[11565.26 → 11565.54] Don't,
[11566.12 → 11567.02] don't need more of it.
[11567.70 → 11568.22] Um,
[11568.34 → 11572.90] I do have a tendency to develop greater ambitions.
[11573.92 → 11575.94] Once I've achieved what I have,
[11576.16 → 11577.62] Yvonne calls me insatiable.
[11578.14 → 11578.70] Um,
[11578.78 → 11579.12] but,
[11579.64 → 11580.98] but I assure,
[11581.42 → 11581.72] I,
[11581.96 → 11582.26] I,
[11582.48 → 11583.56] I,
[11583.56 → 11585.54] I swear the badminton centres,
[11585.66 → 11586.48] the last thing.
[11587.64 → 11588.16] No,
[11588.22 → 11589.14] it's the last thing.
[11591.22 → 11592.38] It's the last thing,
[11592.48 → 11592.72] Luke.
[11593.40 → 11593.92] Well,
[11594.02 → 11594.26] I mean,
[11594.30 → 11597.02] the lab still like is not done in the badminton.
[11597.02 → 11597.86] Edmonton centre is still not.
[11597.92 → 11598.46] I just mean,
[11598.46 → 11602.16] I'm not going to add any more massive projects.
[11603.78 → 11605.18] I don't believe you.
[11605.30 → 11606.18] What I do,
[11606.40 → 11610.64] what I do somewhat believe is that at the very least,
[11610.64 → 11614.52] a pause on purchasing real estate,
[11614.52 → 11619.00] which will limit the ability to do certain things.
[11619.78 → 11620.38] I,
[11620.70 → 11624.44] no part of me believes that you're just like,
[11624.44 → 11627.18] not going to aspire to more.
[11627.18 → 11630.46] that is just hilarious to be completely honest.
[11630.66 → 11631.06] Um,
[11631.62 → 11633.48] what that more is,
[11633.82 → 11636.92] I think you might be able to,
[11637.14 → 11638.30] especially knowing you,
[11638.42 → 11642.90] you might be able to word craft your way out of it being quoted unquote more.
[11642.90 → 11643.58] Because it's,
[11643.66 → 11646.52] it's an expansion of something we're already doing in some way,
[11646.60 → 11646.88] whatever.
[11647.12 → 11647.36] Sure.
[11647.36 → 11648.50] But you know what I mean?
[11649.16 → 11649.60] Um,
[11650.20 → 11653.16] I feel like I'm just getting completely roasted right now.
[11653.26 → 11655.16] There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.
[11656.36 → 11657.26] But yeah,
[11657.26 → 11659.36] I don't know that we're going to use the
[11659.36 → 11660.72] the labs team and,
[11660.78 → 11663.08] and this other something thing to,
[11663.18 → 11665.12] to make extremely high end,
[11665.12 → 11665.94] uh,
[11666.00 → 11668.08] pool toys or something.
[11668.22 → 11668.50] It's like,
[11668.54 → 11668.84] okay,
[11669.66 → 11670.06] sure dude,
[11670.16 → 11671.80] it would be cat toys before pool toys,
[11671.88 → 11672.30] but sure.
[11672.48 → 11672.72] Yeah.
[11672.90 → 11673.12] Yeah.
[11673.14 → 11673.56] But you're like,
[11673.58 → 11677.10] it's not an expansion because we use the labs team to design it, and we use the
[11677.10 → 11678.54] warehouse team to make it.
[11678.78 → 11678.92] Yeah.
[11679.10 → 11679.68] It's just like,
[11679.78 → 11683.02] so you've built all the teams that you need to build,
[11683.10 → 11684.20] to do whatever you want.
[11684.20 → 11684.78] And you're like,
[11684.86 → 11685.78] now I'm not expanding.
[11685.90 → 11686.04] No,
[11686.08 → 11686.74] that doesn't count.
[11687.00 → 11687.60] That counts.
[11687.72 → 11687.92] No,
[11688.00 → 11688.14] no,
[11688.14 → 11688.78] that's legit.
[11689.50 → 11690.64] Stop product development.
[11693.72 → 11694.98] It's all a tax write off.
[11698.08 → 11700.08] Yeah.
[11700.24 → 11702.00] As for Matt Pat's impact,
[11702.10 → 11702.38] I mean,
[11702.48 → 11702.86] yeah,
[11702.98 → 11704.10] massive create,
[11704.22 → 11704.90] create the
[11704.90 → 11706.26] the creative industry.
[11706.84 → 11707.32] Just,
[11707.46 → 11708.84] yeah,
[11708.96 → 11709.34] sure.
[11709.48 → 11709.96] Gaming.
[11710.12 → 11711.00] But honestly,
[11711.00 → 11715.66] I think he's been in some ways more influential to people who have watched him and,
[11715.66 → 11718.32] and not necessarily gone into gaming or game development.
[11718.58 → 11718.82] Uh,
[11718.82 → 11720.70] he's just been an icon.
[11720.70 → 11721.18] Um,
[11721.18 → 11724.28] one of those guys like the green brothers where you're just like,
[11724.28 → 11724.48] yeah,
[11724.80 → 11725.70] an innovator,
[11725.70 → 11726.30] uh,
[11726.30 → 11726.50] is,
[11726.56 → 11727.96] is the word that I would use.
[11728.08 → 11728.78] To describe him.
[11728.86 → 11729.16] I've only,
[11729.26 → 11730.76] I've only had the pleasure of meeting him.
[11734.88 → 11735.32] Twice.
[11735.56 → 11736.70] I want to say.
[11737.22 → 11737.66] Um,
[11737.90 → 11748.12] but he's one of those people that an is exactly the way that you expect him to be based on seeing him on camera and be somehow still manages to surprise you.
[11748.64 → 11749.64] If that makes sense.
[11752.66 → 11753.54] Charles says,
[11753.54 → 11753.74] Hey,
[11753.82 → 11754.00] DL,
[11754.16 → 11757.76] I recently became a father, and when helps keep my sanity through the sleepless nights,
[11757.76 → 11758.58] the last few Fridays,
[11758.58 → 11762.84] what is a piece of advice you wish someone had told you when you became a parent?
[11763.64 → 11764.16] Um,
[11764.56 → 11766.66] just be firm,
[11766.66 → 11769.56] be firm and never,
[11769.56 → 11771.10] be firm and never ever break ranks.
[11771.54 → 11777.80] The second you and your SO say anything that contradicts the other,
[11778.28 → 11780.14] you are done.
[11780.36 → 11785.36] They will find that tiny gap in the armour, and they will wedge their way into it.
[11785.90 → 11786.42] Um,
[11786.42 → 11788.58] and I don't mean that they're evil.
[11788.76 → 11790.10] I just mean that they're people.
[11790.88 → 11791.16] Yeah.
[11791.16 → 11791.32] Little,
[11791.44 → 11792.12] little people,
[11792.78 → 11793.48] annoying people,
[11793.80 → 11795.28] beautiful people,
[11795.32 → 11797.22] but they're people.
[11797.30 → 11797.76] They're smart.
[11798.12 → 11799.06] So watch out.
[11799.46 → 11800.12] And they're,
[11800.24 → 11802.24] and it doesn't matter how smart you are.
[11802.24 → 11804.96] Cause remember they're your genetic junk.
[11805.22 → 11806.92] They're every bit as smart as you are.
[11809.72 → 11810.08] Uh,
[11810.78 → 11811.72] that one's done.
[11812.22 → 11812.48] Uh,
[11812.54 → 11813.18] anonymous says,
[11813.28 → 11813.38] Hey,
[11813.48 → 11815.52] par asocial figments of my imagination.
[11815.84 → 11819.84] You've said before that you try to only make products if you can add value to the market.
[11819.98 → 11821.24] So why cables?
[11821.38 → 11823.62] It feels like there are several quality cable brands.
[11824.20 → 11829.02] So my issue with cables is that they're often not available in the lengths that I want.
[11829.02 → 11831.72] And cable management is something that's a bit of a personal,
[11831.88 → 11832.64] you know,
[11832.68 → 11833.42] passion of mine.
[11833.50 → 11833.60] I,
[11833.60 → 11834.12] I like,
[11834.50 → 11835.36] I like tidiness.
[11835.52 → 11836.18] I like order.
[11836.64 → 11837.10] Um,
[11837.26 → 11839.26] and ours will be available in,
[11839.34 → 11840.72] in between lengths.
[11840.88 → 11844.94] The other thing that we're going to do really well is cut out the BS.
[11845.14 → 11848.66] So instead of super ultra mega speed,
[11848.72 → 11849.56] uh,
[11850.08 → 11855.58] our cables will simply be labelled with the maximum data rate that they can handle and with the maximum power that they can carry.
[11855.92 → 11856.64] That's it.
[11857.18 → 11857.92] No BS.
[11857.92 → 11859.82] It's just excellent cables.
[11860.00 → 11862.68] I also haven't seen many,
[11862.82 → 11868.06] if any cable manufacturers use super high quality silicone sleeving.
[11868.62 → 11869.02] Um,
[11869.16 → 11871.28] Apple used to have some cables like that,
[11871.36 → 11872.94] but they haven't done them in a long time.
[11873.10 → 11877.38] I've seen it in DIY electronics cabling and like wiring rather.
[11877.86 → 11878.10] Uh,
[11878.10 → 11881.60] but seeing it in actually finished cables is pretty rare.
[11881.60 → 11883.14] So between the quality of the cables,
[11883.52 → 11889.42] the availability of middle lengths for optimal cable management and the just no BS labels,
[11889.42 → 11892.36] I think that there's an opportunity for us to make a difference.
[11892.36 → 11893.36] Uh,
[11893.36 → 11898.66] anonymous says,
[11898.76 → 11900.32] Hey Linus and his two carers.
[11900.78 → 11904.42] Just curious to know which rig you've had the most fun building at LTT.
[11905.00 → 11905.36] PS,
[11905.44 → 11907.04] more of the bank water cooling guy,
[11907.20 → 11907.62] please.
[11907.62 → 11910.96] The most fun.
[11911.92 → 11912.26] Oh,
[11912.52 → 11913.26] I don't know.
[11913.26 → 11916.58] Cause there's a fine line between fun and derangement.
[11916.76 → 11918.62] I almost feel like,
[11918.68 → 11918.82] like,
[11918.88 → 11919.14] you know,
[11919.22 → 11920.24] we have,
[11920.28 → 11924.22] we have that video coming very soon of us reflecting on our favourite builds.
[11924.22 → 11927.48] So I curated this as a call-out for that video.
[11927.70 → 11928.02] Basically.
[11928.84 → 11929.08] So,
[11929.08 → 11930.22] well,
[11930.32 → 11931.30] I'm nothing if not predictable.
[11931.50 → 11931.94] We got there.
[11932.08 → 11932.86] We got there.
[11933.00 → 11933.38] Um,
[11934.62 → 11937.14] the mineral oil PC was just sheer joy.
[11937.82 → 11938.98] It wasn't that hard.
[11939.08 → 11940.44] It was just her,
[11940.54 → 11940.64] her,
[11940.64 → 11940.80] her.
[11940.86 → 11944.42] Let's go to the like pet store and buy a castle and put it in a computer.
[11947.64 → 11948.08] Right?
[11948.14 → 11948.60] Like it was,
[11948.88 → 11950.60] we already knew how to do it.
[11950.64 → 11951.48] We had a kit.
[11951.66 → 11952.34] Like it wasn't,
[11952.42 → 11952.68] uh,
[11952.68 → 11953.14] it was just fun.
[11953.30 → 11953.48] Yeah.
[11953.48 → 11953.72] Yeah.
[11953.72 → 11954.74] That was pretty fun.
[11955.00 → 11955.28] Uh,
[11955.42 → 11955.76] we've been,
[11955.80 → 11956.62] we've done a lot of fun.
[11956.62 → 11957.82] I always come back to that one.
[11958.16 → 11958.36] Man,
[11958.42 → 11958.62] like,
[11958.70 → 11959.00] uh,
[11959.00 → 11960.32] and some of it's just like,
[11960.66 → 11960.86] wow,
[11960.90 → 11961.80] even less purpose.
[11961.80 → 11964.70] Like I did that one where we had a heat sink,
[11964.70 → 11968.40] like an air cooler heat sink, and we just like ran water over it.
[11968.44 → 11968.70] We like,
[11968.78 → 11970.32] we put it in water to see,
[11970.48 → 11972.58] can you water cool air cooling?
[11972.80 → 11972.86] Right?
[11972.86 → 11973.72] Like that's just fun.
[11973.78 → 11974.12] It's just fun.
[11974.20 → 11975.58] Did we build a computer really?
[11975.66 → 11976.78] I don't know more.
[11976.86 → 11977.36] We ran a
[11977.42 → 11977.76] you know,
[11977.96 → 11979.04] science fair experiment,
[11979.28 → 11981.50] but it's,
[11981.58 → 11982.86] if we weren't having fun,
[11982.90 → 11983.32] we wouldn't do it.
[11983.32 → 11983.46] Hey,
[11983.46 → 11984.20] speaking of fun,
[11984.52 → 11985.06] um,
[11985.82 → 11991.92] we did how to clean your water cooling recently, and it ended up being a really fun video.
[11992.14 → 11992.64] That's cool.
[11992.78 → 11993.20] Um,
[11993.34 → 11994.22] we were,
[11994.22 → 11997.28] we were going to do it.
[11997.60 → 12001.96] And then a toothbrush sponsor wanted to work with us on a sponsored video.
[12002.04 → 12002.24] I went,
[12002.36 → 12003.00] Holy shit.
[12003.00 → 12008.56] the timing of this is unbelievable because we were just going to do a
[12008.56 → 12010.02] like how to clean your water cooling thing.
[12010.42 → 12013.52] And we weren't really sure if there'd be enough of an audience for that.
[12013.52 → 12014.98] So it wasn't a high priority.
[12014.98 → 12015.82] Uh,
[12015.82 → 12016.96] even though we did want to do it.
[12016.96 → 12017.64] And then,
[12017.76 → 12021.98] and then things got even better because one of my favourite degenerates that works here,
[12022.08 → 12022.44] David,
[12022.44 → 12024.40] who doesn't take care of his stuff,
[12024.40 → 12026.94] which you guys would have seen in his Intel extreme tech upgrade,
[12026.94 → 12030.42] hasn't touched those water cooled systems since I built them.
[12031.22 → 12033.30] And they had some scary stuff in them.
[12033.36 → 12040.24] So we combined checking in on a previous upgrade with how to clean your water cooling with,
[12040.40 → 12042.66] we needed to do a sponsored thing for like a
[12042.66 → 12043.06] like a
[12043.10 → 12046.32] like a super high vibration rate electric toothbrush.
[12046.32 → 12048.52] And it ended up being like a perfect video.
[12048.68 → 12049.62] It's informative.
[12049.82 → 12052.80] It's fun and funny, and it's sponsored.
[12052.80 → 12053.20] So,
[12053.32 → 12053.54] Hey,
[12054.42 → 12055.64] keep the lights on.
[12055.76 → 12056.16] I mean,
[12056.20 → 12057.02] not very on.
[12057.28 → 12058.08] It's when show after dark,
[12058.18 → 12059.60] but only a little bit on a little bit.
[12059.68 → 12059.84] Yeah.
[12060.02 → 12060.50] Yeah.
[12060.70 → 12061.92] We got to pay Dan somehow.
[12062.06 → 12062.28] I mean,
[12062.30 → 12062.42] he,
[12062.94 → 12063.18] Oh,
[12063.64 → 12064.56] Oh,
[12064.84 → 12066.00] he is off working.
[12066.14 → 12066.32] Yeah.
[12067.80 → 12069.00] I'm saying that for them.
[12072.00 → 12072.40] Uh,
[12072.40 → 12073.00] archive.
[12074.18 → 12074.62] Sean says,
[12074.70 → 12074.78] Hey,
[12074.82 → 12075.98] Dillell just got my screwdriver.
[12076.80 → 12082.24] Have you considered doing similar real world reviews with other work battered items like you did with the miners backpack?
[12082.96 → 12083.18] No,
[12083.24 → 12084.78] that just kind of happened by chance.
[12084.92 → 12085.28] Um,
[12085.34 → 12086.42] it's kind of a cool idea,
[12086.52 → 12088.64] but I don't think it's the sort of thing that we'll go out of our way for.
[12088.72 → 12091.26] If you want to see people's real world reviews,
[12091.68 → 12095.40] I LTT store.com is chock-full of them.
[12095.52 → 12098.46] Like if you ever have any doubt in the product,
[12098.88 → 12100.08] feel free to,
[12100.08 → 12101.26] you know,
[12101.62 → 12106.28] peruse the reviews where you will find,
[12106.32 → 12111.18] lots and lots and lots of real world impressions of our products.
[12111.28 → 12114.48] There's over 8,000 reviews for the LTT screwdriver.
[12114.80 → 12116.52] Many of which include photos,
[12116.96 → 12117.16] uh,
[12117.16 → 12118.38] or some of which include photos.
[12118.42 → 12118.98] I shouldn't say many,
[12119.08 → 12119.26] many,
[12119.38 → 12120.84] they can include photos.
[12121.58 → 12121.94] Um,
[12121.98 → 12123.52] a lot of people don't use the feature,
[12123.62 → 12124.58] but they definitely can.
[12124.92 → 12125.12] Yeah,
[12125.52 → 12126.00] man.
[12126.56 → 12126.88] I,
[12127.08 → 12127.66] every once in a while,
[12127.66 → 12128.98] I'll just sit and like read reviews.
[12129.08 → 12129.16] It's,
[12129.22 → 12129.96] I can't even keep up.
[12130.02 → 12130.34] Look at this.
[12130.80 → 12132.64] All of these are from the 6th of March.
[12132.64 → 12133.64] Okay.
[12134.24 → 12135.58] So we're on March 5th here.
[12136.02 → 12136.92] Here we go.
[12137.16 → 12139.64] All of these are from March the 5th.
[12140.08 → 12140.52] Okay.
[12140.56 → 12141.64] Now we're on to March the 4th.
[12142.50 → 12145.86] Like people are really passionate about this product.
[12145.92 → 12149.18] Even the ones that aren't five star are like,
[12149.18 → 12151.00] dang,
[12151.14 → 12154.22] I really appreciate the behind the scenes decision.
[12154.34 → 12156.68] This is a reflection of the dedication of the quality of LTT.
[12156.86 → 12158.74] Like I can't read all the amazing,
[12158.92 → 12160.80] wonderful things that people say about our screwdrivers.
[12160.82 → 12162.74] And that five-star one includes a line saying,
[12162.84 → 12164.46] I signed up for the precision screwdriver.
[12165.26 → 12165.66] Exactly.
[12166.70 → 12167.10] Exactly.
[12168.16 → 12168.78] Oh man.
[12169.06 → 12169.28] I'm,
[12169.40 → 12172.14] I'm glad I can support great content with actual great products.
[12172.14 → 12172.46] Like,
[12172.56 → 12173.66] dang man.
[12173.76 → 12173.96] Yeah,
[12174.04 → 12174.56] exactly.
[12178.54 → 12178.94] Okay.
[12179.00 → 12181.14] So I've dealt with all the incoming and potentials.
[12181.14 → 12181.52] Nice.
[12181.74 → 12182.06] Okay.
[12182.18 → 12183.14] I can read if you would like.
[12183.14 → 12184.36] You want to participate for a change?
[12184.52 → 12185.60] How about I read one for you?
[12185.90 → 12186.34] Ryan G.
[12186.58 → 12188.34] If I buy this with my company card,
[12188.70 → 12189.94] is it a tax write off?
[12190.04 → 12190.28] Yes.
[12190.88 → 12191.24] No.
[12192.14 → 12193.74] I'll use the mouse pad for work.
[12194.28 → 12194.60] Oh,
[12194.72 → 12195.24] then yes.
[12195.32 → 12195.60] Maybe.
[12197.08 → 12197.40] Partially.
[12197.54 → 12197.78] Maybe.
[12198.60 → 12199.24] Also Luke,
[12199.24 → 12201.54] what's the hardest challenge you've had to solve at float plane other than
[12201.54 → 12202.14] live-streaming?
[12202.32 → 12202.42] Oh,
[12202.60 → 12202.76] yeah.
[12204.10 → 12204.58] Oh,
[12204.98 → 12206.04] payment processors.
[12206.98 → 12208.66] That's been very annoying.
[12209.26 → 12209.64] Um,
[12209.66 → 12212.04] I think the biggest one is protection.
[12212.04 → 12216.52] Accomplishing what HR with the team size that we have.
[12216.96 → 12217.34] Um,
[12217.66 → 12218.46] I,
[12218.50 → 12222.54] I can't really understate how crazy it is that we were able to pull that off.
[12222.72 → 12223.56] Very talented team.
[12223.64 → 12224.08] Um,
[12224.16 → 12226.08] shout out actually kind of nuts.
[12226.46 → 12226.94] Um,
[12226.94 → 12230.70] and anytime that like,
[12231.34 → 12231.58] yeah,
[12231.60 → 12232.10] I don't know.
[12232.34 → 12232.46] I,
[12232.56 → 12234.54] I don't want to get way too into it,
[12234.58 → 12238.66] but like building a new feature when you have like,
[12239.14 → 12239.44] Oh,
[12239.56 → 12239.90] um,
[12239.90 → 12240.26] yes,
[12240.26 → 12242.88] this individual person is responsible for,
[12242.96 → 12243.36] um,
[12243.42 → 12245.66] all the apps and all the front end.
[12245.78 → 12246.04] Yeah.
[12246.04 → 12246.36] Um,
[12246.48 → 12249.42] we like to know of other sort of creator,
[12249.42 → 12250.86] um,
[12251.00 → 12251.46] you know,
[12251.84 → 12253.18] platform things.
[12253.18 → 12259.70] And they have a team of like a lot of people that do that entire team has fewer responsibilities
[12259.70 → 12260.58] than that one person.
[12260.58 → 12262.20] And the thing that,
[12262.40 → 12265.70] that it just has a lot of things that were kind of like,
[12265.74 → 12265.86] Oh,
[12265.92 → 12266.14] okay.
[12266.82 → 12267.30] Yeah.
[12267.30 → 12270.12] So not shouting out anyone in particular.
[12270.48 → 12270.58] No,
[12270.62 → 12272.66] just our team is very talented, and they're great.
[12272.96 → 12273.36] Yeah.
[12273.44 → 12274.00] And you know what?
[12274.12 → 12275.34] Their leader is pretty great.
[12275.92 → 12276.12] Yeah.
[12276.24 → 12276.98] Thanks man.
[12277.06 → 12277.24] Oh,
[12277.30 → 12277.82] you mean you.
[12278.02 → 12278.30] Oh,
[12278.44 → 12278.82] I mean,
[12279.16 → 12279.80] you mean you.
[12279.88 → 12280.18] No,
[12280.24 → 12280.48] I mean,
[12280.54 → 12280.82] Taryn.
[12281.52 → 12281.84] Oh,
[12282.22 → 12282.70] that's not,
[12282.96 → 12283.82] that's just,
[12283.98 → 12285.02] I was just bugging you.
[12285.34 → 12285.72] Was that,
[12286.16 → 12287.92] that would be right though.
[12288.06 → 12288.22] Yeah.
[12288.30 → 12288.52] Oh,
[12288.56 → 12290.76] I'm not in their reporting path at all anymore.
[12290.98 → 12291.22] Wait,
[12291.26 → 12291.66] is it?
[12292.10 → 12293.40] Because he's the leader.
[12294.04 → 12294.42] Is he?
[12294.72 → 12295.00] No,
[12295.12 → 12295.64] hold on a second.
[12295.64 → 12296.46] Am I still CEO?
[12296.46 → 12296.78] I think it's still you.
[12296.78 → 12300.48] You're still CEO.
[12300.70 → 12301.50] That's hilarious.
[12301.66 → 12302.44] I probably shouldn't be.
[12304.56 → 12306.06] When you don't know.
[12308.76 → 12310.82] I never thought about this at all.
[12311.14 → 12311.54] Yeah.
[12311.74 → 12312.70] That's so funny.
[12314.18 → 12316.36] You can tell that reporting line was important.
[12316.54 → 12316.76] Yeah.
[12316.90 → 12317.60] Whoops doodles.
[12320.16 → 12320.64] Oh,
[12320.84 → 12322.12] okay.
[12324.56 → 12325.40] Elias says,
[12325.40 → 12326.22] Hey Linus,
[12326.22 → 12330.92] have you switched to that alienware AW2725DF monitor that you unboxed for first circuit?
[12331.02 → 12331.94] I wanted it back.
[12332.78 → 12333.12] Oh,
[12333.22 → 12335.58] so I haven't gotten one yet.
[12335.58 → 12336.30] Because I'm lazy.
[12336.40 → 12336.56] Also,
[12336.62 → 12337.50] it's tiny.
[12337.50 → 12340.38] So on my incentive to upgrade to it has been pretty low.
[12340.38 → 12341.74] I do want it though.
[12341.74 → 12341.98] Man,
[12342.02 → 12343.72] it was just,
[12343.82 → 12344.48] I couldn't miss.
[12344.74 → 12345.68] I couldn't miss Luke.
[12346.18 → 12346.68] It's like,
[12346.68 → 12347.28] I was cheating.
[12347.84 → 12348.48] I'm tempted,
[12348.60 → 12349.32] but it's so much money.
[12349.42 → 12350.50] It's so good.
[12351.44 → 12352.30] It's so much money.
[12352.30 → 12355.94] And I'm like trying to get away from shooters right now because how many cheaters there are.
[12355.98 → 12356.10] Do it.
[12356.12 → 12356.54] You coward.
[12357.26 → 12358.28] How much is it?
[12358.58 → 12358.74] Oh,
[12358.74 → 12360.32] it's like 700 us dollars or something.
[12360.32 → 12360.80] Oh,
[12360.80 → 12363.32] Oh,
[12363.32 → 12363.40] Oh,
[12363.40 → 12363.44] Oh,
[12363.44 → 12364.44] Oh,
[12364.44 → 12366.62] and my next monitor dies.
[12366.84 → 12367.82] It'll be cheaper then.
[12368.26 → 12368.34] Yeah.
[12368.34 → 12369.94] It's like a thousand Canadian dollars,
[12370.06 → 12370.16] dude.
[12370.26 → 12370.56] Oh,
[12371.08 → 12372.56] yeah,
[12372.60 → 12372.90] dog.
[12372.90 → 12375.18] I was talking to,
[12375.22 → 12377.40] I was doing not salary,
[12377.52 → 12379.70] but contract rate negotiations with someone today.
[12380.30 → 12380.78] Um,
[12381.22 → 12383.58] and they told me their U S number.
[12384.44 → 12385.14] I was like,
[12385.26 → 12385.58] nice.
[12386.52 → 12388.02] And then I converted it, and I was like,
[12388.14 → 12388.36] Oh,
[12389.02 → 12391.14] nice.
[12391.44 → 12392.18] We'll see,
[12392.26 → 12394.66] man.
[12394.72 → 12395.78] Look at these reviews though.
[12396.78 → 12398.38] This monitor is true.
[12398.42 → 12398.74] Wow.
[12398.74 → 12401.18] Factor best monitor I ever owned.
[12401.50 → 12402.66] Astounding OLED monitor.
[12402.66 → 12403.86] OLED is the wave.
[12404.10 → 12405.62] It's the wave.
[12407.60 → 12409.44] This is almost as good as our screwdriver.
[12409.62 → 12409.88] Luke.
[12410.16 → 12410.94] Look at this.
[12411.14 → 12411.92] That's genuinely pretty.
[12411.98 → 12412.26] Actually.
[12412.56 → 12412.84] Oh,
[12412.92 → 12413.04] well,
[12413.06 → 12413.28] hold on.
[12413.34 → 12414.08] It's a sort by highest.
[12414.22 → 12414.28] Totally.
[12414.34 → 12414.46] God,
[12414.52 → 12416.02] that cannot be the default Dell.
[12416.16 → 12417.22] What the Dell?
[12417.72 → 12417.96] Wow.
[12418.62 → 12418.80] Okay.
[12418.88 → 12420.90] Ours are sorted by most recent.
[12421.58 → 12421.80] Okay.
[12421.80 → 12423.44] So let's see what they end up with then.
[12424.00 → 12424.84] What just happened?
[12424.90 → 12426.22] Did that just do anything?
[12426.32 → 12426.96] I don't think so.
[12427.34 → 12428.20] Oh my God.
[12428.98 → 12429.58] Most relevant.
[12429.74 → 12429.94] Hello.
[12430.34 → 12430.62] Okay.
[12430.62 → 12431.60] That one changed.
[12431.92 → 12432.20] Okay.
[12432.20 → 12433.10] Most recent.
[12433.88 → 12435.12] A shining star on my desk.
[12435.18 → 12435.46] Okay.
[12435.58 → 12436.48] Is this okay?
[12436.48 → 12437.76] I don't know what just happened here.
[12438.82 → 12439.30] Anyway,
[12439.54 → 12442.44] it may be even better than the LTT.
[12442.60 → 12442.80] Oh,
[12443.16 → 12444.06] died after a week.
[12445.74 → 12446.22] Dude,
[12446.40 → 12447.28] this is a
[12447.46 → 12447.56] okay.
[12447.56 → 12448.86] other than DOA,
[12449.44 → 12451.98] it gets five stars.
[12451.98 → 12452.94] Which is going to happen with monitors.
[12453.04 → 12453.78] Disappointing packaging.
[12453.94 → 12454.28] So it's,
[12454.28 → 12456.34] so it's got a problem with it.
[12458.56 → 12459.62] Screen lottery risks.
[12459.72 → 12460.20] Packaging.
[12460.30 → 12460.60] Again,
[12460.82 → 12462.76] anyone who gets a working one is like,
[12462.86 → 12463.28] OMG,
[12463.52 → 12464.42] the best thing ever.
[12464.42 → 12464.82] And I,
[12464.82 → 12465.08] I,
[12465.08 → 12466.04] I backed that up.
[12466.26 → 12466.66] Epic.
[12466.84 → 12467.74] Had to get a replacement.
[12468.30 → 12470.90] Literally every single one that isn't five stars.
[12471.38 → 12472.14] It was like,
[12472.14 → 12473.34] it's broke.
[12474.62 → 12475.36] That's pretty epic.
[12475.64 → 12476.14] Someone said,
[12476.26 → 12477.72] doesn't Linus pay for,
[12477.72 → 12478.66] uh,
[12478.74 → 12479.58] Luke's computer stuff?
[12479.74 → 12480.56] For the tower.
[12480.82 → 12481.04] Yep.
[12481.10 → 12481.48] That's it.
[12481.72 → 12481.92] Yep.
[12482.24 → 12483.18] That's where I draw the line.
[12483.18 → 12483.80] I'm not,
[12483.84 → 12484.12] I'm not,
[12484.12 → 12485.12] I draw the line.
[12485.12 → 12485.96] I'm not complaining.
[12485.96 → 12486.68] I'm not complaining.
[12486.82 → 12487.16] I draw the line.
[12487.38 → 12488.54] Monitors and peripherals and stuff.
[12488.94 → 12489.60] See this right here?
[12490.16 → 12491.22] This is a line.
[12491.22 → 12496.82] Some of them sound hello scripted.
[12496.96 → 12497.26] Yeah.
[12497.60 → 12498.20] Some of what?
[12498.56 → 12498.78] Oh,
[12498.88 → 12499.28] maybe.
[12499.76 → 12500.00] Yeah,
[12500.02 → 12500.22] sure.
[12500.28 → 12500.44] I mean,
[12500.46 → 12501.02] they might be fake.
[12501.10 → 12501.50] We don't know.
[12501.60 → 12502.08] Ours are not.
[12502.34 → 12502.54] Yeah.
[12503.30 → 12503.66] Um,
[12504.52 → 12505.12] Mike says,
[12505.12 → 12510.32] I'm saving this gift card until I can buy an LTT tax write-off shirt in big and tall sizes.
[12510.84 → 12511.10] Linus,
[12511.18 → 12512.64] please tell me when I'll be able to spend this.
[12512.68 → 12514.00] I'm not guaranteeing that.
[12514.46 → 12515.10] I'm Gary.
[12515.20 → 12516.20] I guarantee nothing,
[12516.32 → 12518.24], but thank you for the
[12518.42 → 12520.30] your tax liability gift card.
[12521.22 → 12522.64] It's not a tax liability.
[12522.94 → 12523.70] It's just a
[12523.84 → 12523.94] wait,
[12524.00 → 12524.28] hold on.
[12524.32 → 12524.56] Is it?
[12524.82 → 12525.10] No,
[12525.16 → 12528.46] I think it might be because it counts as an asset,
[12528.72 → 12529.50] but it's not,
[12529.70 → 12530.90] I can't remember how it works,
[12530.92 → 12534.46] but gift cards are actually like sort of inconvenient in a sense.
[12534.46 → 12535.06] Like there are,
[12535.14 → 12535.40] there are,
[12535.46 → 12538.60] there are liability when you count your business assets or whatever.
[12538.98 → 12539.76] It's fine though.
[12539.86 → 12541.52] Please buy gift cards or whatever.
[12541.94 → 12542.38] Um,
[12542.48 → 12543.16] Igor says,
[12543.24 → 12545.84] just got a job as a computer teacher for teenagers and young adults.
[12546.10 → 12547.28] Aside from PC building,
[12547.46 → 12549.66] what do you consider important skills for PC enthusiasts?
[12549.66 → 12552.58] I really want to light a fire in students troubleshooting.
[12552.94 → 12553.38] The
[12553.52 → 12559.26] the rush of solving a problem is one that can't be under,
[12559.48 → 12561.98] can't be over what it shouldn't be under.
[12562.42 → 12563.26] It's good.
[12566.38 → 12566.94] Yeah.
[12566.94 → 12573.04] I think a security focused lesson where,
[12573.04 → 12573.94] uh,
[12574.80 → 12576.74] you make it like the
[12576.74 → 12577.56] the students,
[12577.56 → 12579.34] I don't know,
[12579.72 → 12583.20] trying to teach kids security stuff and trying to make it fun.
[12583.20 → 12584.28] It could be kind of cool.
[12584.28 → 12588.16] Like maybe you could have split the team into like split the class into like
[12588.16 → 12589.16] four teams or something,
[12589.16 → 12590.18] uh,
[12590.18 → 12591.50] and give them like,
[12591.54 → 12594.06] they have to like to send emails to each other, and they have to be able to
[12594.06 → 12597.70] detect which email is like sketchy or something.
[12597.78 → 12598.38] I don't know.
[12598.72 → 12599.16] Um,
[12599.98 → 12600.60] it could be interesting.
[12601.08 → 12602.82] It would need some workshopping,
[12602.90 → 12603.52] but it could be fun.
[12603.76 → 12604.10] If you,
[12604.18 → 12608.30] if you could find some way to teach kids good,
[12608.30 → 12610.04] you know,
[12610.14 → 12612.94] internet usage practices in regard to security,
[12612.94 → 12613.86] that would be super,
[12614.00 → 12614.94] super valuable for them.
[12614.98 → 12616.40] And if you could find a way to make it fun,
[12616.48 → 12617.22] that would be great.
[12617.22 → 12619.02] Hello,
[12619.24 → 12620.50] Linus tax tips.
[12620.76 → 12621.56] I'm Chaz.
[12621.84 → 12624.96] What are some odd things you've seen wired up to a computer?
[12624.96 → 12630.16] I E I'm wiring up an after market car stereo from the 2010s to my PC for audio
[12630.16 → 12632.22] and CD slash DVD playback.
[12633.32 → 12634.74] That's an odd one.
[12635.20 → 12635.68] Um,
[12636.24 → 12640.80] Alex wanted to run a subwoofer off of a computer power supply.
[12640.80 → 12641.52] For some reason,
[12641.52 → 12643.52] he wanted to build the computer into a sub enclosure.
[12643.64 → 12644.70] We didn't actually do that,
[12644.74 → 12645.94] but he wanted to.
[12645.94 → 12646.72] Sounds cool.
[12646.82 → 12650.24] Cigarette lighters are one of the funny ones from the like late nineties,
[12650.32 → 12651.10] early two thousands.
[12651.28 → 12652.86] You could get five and a quarter inch Bay,
[12652.94 → 12653.98] like cigarette lighters.
[12654.76 → 12655.20] Um,
[12655.82 → 12663.72] I have personally just run power out of my computer for fans that are not
[12663.72 → 12667.20] actually in the computer or lights that are not actually in the computer.
[12667.30 → 12667.96] They're just somewhere else.
[12667.96 → 12669.66] Because it was just convenient.
[12669.66 → 12671.32] Because it was a Mole connector.
[12671.32 → 12671.76] And I was like,
[12671.82 → 12672.32] here we go.
[12672.32 → 12675.84] I mean,
[12675.88 → 12676.44] power's power,
[12676.54 → 12676.70] right?
[12677.40 → 12677.72] Yeah.
[12678.58 → 12679.44] Give it to the people.
[12679.86 → 12680.22] Christopher.
[12680.50 → 12680.86] Hey,
[12680.92 → 12681.24] LLD.
[12681.40 → 12682.06] First time buyer.
[12682.38 → 12685.02] My partner and I can't wait to read this to our baby.
[12685.06 → 12686.10] Who's arriving in a few weeks.
[12686.18 → 12686.62] Heck yeah.
[12686.70 → 12687.28] ABC is a gaming.
[12687.38 → 12687.74] Let's go.
[12688.16 → 12691.88] Any tips for managing screen time for young kids as ours grows up?
[12691.88 → 12692.68] Um,
[12692.96 → 12694.74] don't use it as a crutch.
[12694.84 → 12698.60] The biggest obstacle to managing kids screen time is parents.
[12700.70 → 12701.96] You have to learn.
[12702.32 → 12706.82] You have to be disciplined enough to force them to be disciplined enough to not
[12706.82 → 12707.56] just stare at a screen.
[12707.72 → 12709.92] Your kids are going to scream and cry in a restaurant.
[12710.52 → 12712.24] So you have two options.
[12712.54 → 12718.90] You can have a pleasant meal by giving them your phone, or you can soldier it
[12718.90 → 12719.06] out.
[12719.06 → 12720.54] You can grab your kid,
[12720.92 → 12721.74] take them out of the
[12721.82 → 12722.80] not like this.
[12723.02 → 12724.44] I just meant grab your kid.
[12724.64 → 12725.20] No shake.
[12725.30 → 12726.66] Take them out of the restaurant.
[12726.80 → 12728.36] I used to do this all the time.
[12728.96 → 12730.36] Your food's going to get cold.
[12730.94 → 12736.52] Your steak is going to get tough while it sits there, and you are not eating it.
[12737.28 → 12740.92] You sit them down outside the restaurant, and you go,
[12741.06 → 12743.10] the way you're behaving is not okay.
[12743.10 → 12745.90] Do you like being out here?
[12746.96 → 12747.30] No.
[12747.72 → 12749.18] Do you think I want to be out here?
[12750.40 → 12750.74] Well,
[12750.78 → 12751.62] what do we need to do?
[12753.90 → 12755.88] You need to stop the noise you're making.
[12756.26 → 12757.16] That's not okay.
[12757.46 → 12758.64] Nobody wants to hear that.
[12759.04 → 12759.94] And when you're done,
[12760.10 → 12761.20] we can go back inside.
[12762.10 → 12763.12] If it takes too long,
[12763.74 → 12764.86] you go back inside,
[12765.00 → 12765.52] you leave them there,
[12765.56 → 12766.10] you stand there,
[12766.26 → 12767.12] you watch them through the window,
[12767.22 → 12769.48] you make sure no one's going to take off with your kid or whatever.
[12769.48 → 12772.02] You wait it out.
[12773.16 → 12775.14] There will be times when it will take an hour.
[12776.78 → 12781.98] But what they learn is when you say you will eat this food,
[12782.64 → 12784.46] you will do it quietly.
[12786.32 → 12787.74] But that's what will happen.
[12788.40 → 12793.50] They can have a lot of tears in between, or they can yell, or they can do whatever,
[12793.82 → 12794.94] but that's what's going to happen.
[12795.78 → 12796.06] I mean,
[12796.14 → 12798.34] I've never had to hit my kids,
[12798.34 → 12800.54] never had to like,
[12800.70 → 12801.20] you know,
[12801.28 → 12809.64] be done we focused on whatever we say will happen, and we will wait you out.
[12810.02 → 12812.62] And it has been so effective.
[12812.96 → 12813.76] I've seen some of it.
[12814.36 → 12814.84] Time.
[12816.40 → 12816.84] Yep.
[12817.32 → 12821.30] And I don't mind putting them in a slightly unpleasant situation.
[12821.64 → 12822.98] I also like as a
[12822.98 → 12824.90] as a childless person,
[12824.90 → 12825.72] um,
[12825.72 → 12831.36] I kind of appreciate it because if you just sit there,
[12831.60 → 12833.08] if you don't do the phone thing,
[12833.08 → 12834.80] but you just sit there and don't do anything,
[12834.80 → 12837.38] then it's just annoying for everybody else.
[12837.92 → 12839.80] So by like removing them from the scenario,
[12839.80 → 12840.18] it's like,
[12840.22 → 12840.44] okay.
[12840.54 → 12843.18] And there will be escalating levels of unpleasantness.
[12843.18 → 12849.28] Like the first place I might put them when they're not behaving at the restaurant is inside the restaurant,
[12849.42 → 12850.24] sitting at the front.
[12851.24 → 12853.98] And I just ignore them while they do not get it.
[12853.98 → 12854.64] They want attention,
[12854.74 → 12854.86] right?
[12854.94 → 12856.56] So don't give them attention for that.
[12856.56 → 12858.34] And then if they keep doing it,
[12858.66 → 12858.88] well,
[12858.92 → 12859.14] Hey,
[12859.50 → 12861.72] next step is outside.
[12862.16 → 12862.50] Yeah.
[12862.52 → 12862.84] He said,
[12862.88 → 12863.80] he said had to,
[12863.88 → 12865.10] he would never hit his kids.
[12865.28 → 12865.46] Yeah.
[12865.56 → 12866.52] It was just a very much thing.
[12866.58 → 12866.74] Don't worry.
[12866.76 → 12870.20] I think some people justify it by saying that they had to,
[12870.26 → 12871.16] that there was no other way.
[12871.36 → 12871.56] Yeah.
[12871.64 → 12878.98] And I strongly believe that patience is the most powerful tool because they're not disciplined.
[12878.98 → 12879.68] They're kids.
[12880.32 → 12880.72] They,
[12880.94 → 12883.16] they are not patient.
[12883.16 → 12885.00] If you're willing to,
[12885.26 → 12888.08] you can always outlast them always.
[12888.52 → 12889.46] And like I said,
[12889.58 → 12889.94] I'm not,
[12890.06 → 12892.58] it's not that I'm not willing to put them in an unpleasant situation.
[12892.58 → 12893.84] So at our old house,
[12893.84 → 12896.96] step one of timeout was the laundry room.
[12897.50 → 12899.86] Step two was through the door in the garage.
[12900.36 → 12903.20] And step three was out the back door outside.
[12903.60 → 12905.32] And I don't care what the weather is.
[12906.30 → 12907.64] I don't care how late it is.
[12907.66 → 12908.78] I don't care how tired you are.
[12908.92 → 12909.90] If I said,
[12910.68 → 12911.40] brush your teeth,
[12911.40 → 12914.36] you will brush your teeth.
[12914.88 → 12915.56] You will.
[12916.48 → 12917.92] And then when we're done,
[12918.30 → 12918.88] I say,
[12919.18 → 12919.50] okay,
[12919.66 → 12920.78] did I say brush your teeth?
[12921.10 → 12921.30] Mm-hmm.
[12921.48 → 12921.88] Okay.
[12921.96 → 12922.98] Did you brush your teeth?
[12923.46 → 12923.76] Yeah.
[12923.92 → 12927.42] Could that have gone a lot faster and a lot more pleasantly?
[12927.82 → 12928.12] Mm-hmm.
[12928.36 → 12928.76] Okay.
[12928.92 → 12929.86] Well then next time,
[12929.90 → 12930.84] why don't we do it that way?
[12931.98 → 12933.00] And you've got to be,
[12933.14 → 12934.90] you've got to be willing to stand your ground.
[12935.00 → 12935.12] Man,
[12935.14 → 12936.54] I remember this one time in Ikea.
[12937.54 → 12937.86] Man,
[12938.02 → 12938.50] I could hear,
[12938.58 → 12941.30] I could hear everyone around me like talking about me.
[12942.12 → 12942.44] Uh,
[12942.44 → 12944.16] because my middle,
[12944.32 → 12952.74] my middle child was crying for over an hour in the food court because I said she had to take one more bite.
[12954.18 → 12955.66] And she didn't want to.
[12956.30 → 12958.96] And I felt awful because she was overtired.
[12958.96 → 12959.52] I knew,
[12959.62 → 12960.36] I knew,
[12960.58 → 12963.58] I knew as soon as we were getting into it that she was,
[12963.64 → 12964.32] she was overtired.
[12964.42 → 12967.08] She was overdue for her nap, and it had been kind of a long day.
[12967.36 → 12969.28] And realistically it was like,
[12969.80 → 12970.80] it was crankiness.
[12970.88 → 12972.40] It's not because she's a bad kid or whatever.
[12972.40 → 12976.04] But I had already said,
[12976.16 → 12977.86] you have to take one more bite.
[12979.20 → 12979.94] So it's,
[12980.00 → 12980.80] it's been stated.
[12981.02 → 12982.54] The word has been uttered.
[12982.86 → 12984.58] And as soon as they,
[12984.74 → 12986.44] as soon as they find the gaps,
[12986.44 → 12987.78] um,
[12987.78 → 12988.60] now,
[12988.60 → 12990.54] if I act overtired,
[12990.54 → 12992.82] I can get away with X,
[12992.84 → 12992.94] Y,
[12992.94 → 12993.78] they're smart.
[12994.44 → 12995.66] They're too smart.
[12997.06 → 12997.58] Um,
[12997.98 → 12998.82] and so,
[12999.08 → 13000.44] Oh,
[13000.50 → 13000.78] that's,
[13000.84 → 13003.90] and that's a big one is when they finally take the bite,
[13004.08 → 13005.82] huge positive reinforcement.
[13005.82 → 13011.08] Like that's perfect to big snuggles and pick them up and like,
[13011.16 → 13011.48] whatever.
[13011.70 → 13012.18] Right.
[13012.48 → 13012.66] Oh,
[13012.68 → 13013.42] and never bribe.
[13013.80 → 13014.78] That's another one.
[13015.68 → 13017.50] Always reward unexpectedly.
[13018.68 → 13019.20] Never.
[13019.94 → 13020.50] Okay.
[13020.50 → 13022.02] We can get the toy.
[13022.12 → 13023.18] If you eat your meal,
[13023.78 → 13025.84] you will eat the meal.
[13027.36 → 13028.36] They eat it.
[13028.54 → 13028.94] You go,
[13029.18 → 13030.12] good job.
[13031.04 → 13033.04] Why don't we go get a treat?
[13034.36 → 13035.68] Never treat up front.
[13036.16 → 13036.36] Never,
[13036.44 → 13036.58] never,
[13036.64 → 13036.76] never,
[13036.84 → 13036.98] never.
[13037.06 → 13037.20] Yeah.
[13037.22 → 13038.16] I think that's a pretty good point.
[13038.46 → 13038.72] Yep.
[13041.04 → 13042.74] Has there been any funny parenting story?
[13042.80 → 13043.00] I mean,
[13043.02 → 13044.70] I thought the one in the Ikea was pretty funny.
[13044.84 → 13045.56] I thought it was pretty good.
[13045.62 → 13046.28] It's terrible.
[13046.62 → 13046.78] Uh,
[13046.78 → 13048.18] there was the one time my eldest,
[13048.34 → 13048.86] um,
[13049.04 → 13050.22] who was very shy,
[13050.62 → 13051.08] um,
[13051.10 → 13054.42] almost made us miss a ferry because we were at the park playing.
[13054.72 → 13056.04] And as we were leaving,
[13056.62 → 13057.06] um,
[13057.10 → 13058.92] he had borrowed a toy from another kid,
[13058.94 → 13060.04] like a little truck or something.
[13060.26 → 13061.06] And I said,
[13061.12 → 13061.38] okay,
[13061.70 → 13064.14] I'll go give the toy back and thank him for letting you borrow it.
[13064.60 → 13065.80] And he went, and he put it on the train.
[13065.80 → 13067.18] Put the truck down and he left.
[13067.92 → 13068.58] I said,
[13068.64 → 13068.82] Hey,
[13069.78 → 13070.20] I said,
[13070.24 → 13072.28] you need to thank that boy for lending you his toy.
[13072.42 → 13073.42] I remember this.
[13073.78 → 13074.50] I wasn't there,
[13074.58 → 13075.20] but I remember the story.
[13075.20 → 13075.94] And he,
[13076.04 → 13078.68] and he cried and cried and cried because he,
[13078.68 → 13080.54] he just had this sort of this petrification.
[13080.54 → 13081.08] He was,
[13081.18 → 13082.58] he was so shy sometimes,
[13082.58 → 13084.24] but it doesn't matter.
[13084.42 → 13088.64] You will be polite, and you will be a decent human being.
[13088.64 → 13090.78] I don't care how shy you are.
[13090.78 → 13092.78] If somebody does something for you,
[13093.02 → 13094.10] you will thank them.
[13094.70 → 13095.14] Period.
[13096.38 → 13096.78] And,
[13096.78 → 13097.54] uh,
[13097.54 → 13099.26] that was one of our biggest battles.
[13099.36 → 13100.92] It was also one of our last ones.
[13101.36 → 13101.80] Um,
[13101.80 → 13103.44] because he was getting to the age where.
[13103.94 → 13104.68] It's kind of getting it.
[13104.72 → 13105.18] It was he,
[13105.36 → 13105.76] where he,
[13106.20 → 13107.28] where he was getting it.
[13107.64 → 13108.08] And,
[13108.18 → 13108.40] uh,
[13108.40 → 13112.02] and we made that ferry by like 30 seconds.
[13112.02 → 13112.46] I,
[13112.60 → 13112.88] I,
[13113.04 → 13114.22] it was barely.
[13114.36 → 13116.46] And we were at that park and my wife's like,
[13116.48 → 13117.66] we are going to miss this ferry.
[13117.84 → 13118.26] Like,
[13118.36 → 13120.08] and it was important for some reason.
[13120.16 → 13121.56] It was important for some reason.
[13121.56 → 13122.90] We had to make this ferry.
[13123.12 → 13124.00] And I was like,
[13124.12 → 13124.44] well,
[13124.56 → 13125.86] then you better,
[13126.10 → 13130.36] then you better get with me on convincing him to go thank that kid.
[13130.54 → 13135.16] And I think our compromise was that she got to play good cop a little bit,
[13135.26 → 13136.78] which you must always agree on.
[13136.78 → 13139.34] If someone's going to be good cop and someone's going to be bad cop,
[13139.44 → 13139.96] you agree,
[13140.06 → 13140.66] you take turns,
[13140.66 → 13143.06] but she was going to be good cop, and she was going to go with him.
[13144.20 → 13146.18] She didn't hold his hand all the way there.
[13146.24 → 13147.18] She didn't talk for him,
[13147.22 → 13149.30] but she went, and she stood behind him,
[13149.58 → 13150.82] which gave him the confidence.
[13151.64 → 13152.50] Someone's got your back.
[13152.58 → 13153.08] That makes sense.
[13153.42 → 13153.56] Yeah.
[13154.64 → 13155.80] But once we,
[13155.92 → 13158.64] once we say you will do it,
[13159.14 → 13161.28] you will do it.
[13161.34 → 13162.68] So now the kids are just like,
[13163.32 → 13166.60] you say something, and they just do it because they know,
[13166.60 → 13167.18] they will.
[13167.62 → 13172.56] So I could do it now or there could be like a big fight and consequences and it
[13172.56 → 13173.14] could suck.
[13173.34 → 13175.30] I wonder how this is going to go in teenage years.
[13176.00 → 13176.98] It's going to be different.
[13177.32 → 13177.80] We got,
[13177.88 → 13178.60] we already see it,
[13178.60 → 13179.02] right?
[13179.04 → 13179.60] Like it's,
[13179.68 → 13179.90] um,
[13179.90 → 13180.22] and,
[13180.42 → 13182.26] and the thing is you've got to be ready for that.
[13182.32 → 13184.48] Your authority is not always going to be absolute.
[13184.48 → 13188.02] we're already having that conversation with the eldest where we're going like,
[13188.10 → 13188.26] look,
[13188.40 → 13193.18] you are going to be making a lot of your own decisions ongoing here,
[13193.24 → 13195.14] a lot more of your own decisions over time.
[13195.14 → 13197.18] And so we start to involve him in them.
[13197.18 → 13197.48] Like,
[13197.58 → 13197.90] uh,
[13198.32 → 13198.72] um,
[13198.78 → 13204.60] he had a bit of a persistent injury and really wanted to keep doing his badminton
[13204.60 → 13205.02] training.
[13205.40 → 13207.00] But we,
[13207.00 → 13210.54] we have some concerns about developing a chronic injury before you're even an
[13210.54 → 13210.90] adult.
[13211.22 → 13212.40] And we were basically like,
[13212.44 → 13212.62] okay,
[13212.62 → 13213.68] so here's what we're going to do.
[13213.74 → 13214.40] We're not going to,
[13214.48 → 13216.36] we're not going to tell you what you're going to do.
[13216.42 → 13220.58] We're going to outline all the different possibilities and all the different
[13220.58 → 13221.08] options.
[13221.08 → 13223.52] We're going to tell you which one we think you should do.
[13223.76 → 13225.80] And then you are going to make a decision.
[13225.92 → 13229.72] So you have to start going through those processes with them because otherwise
[13229.72 → 13233.24] you're not really equipping them for the future when they will have to make
[13233.24 → 13233.96] their own decisions.
[13234.30 → 13237.46] Do you talk about like how you came up with those options and how you establish
[13237.46 → 13238.48] the pros and cons and stuff?
[13238.56 → 13238.70] Yeah.
[13238.80 → 13239.62] So we kind of go,
[13239.72 → 13239.82] okay,
[13239.82 → 13240.02] look,
[13240.08 → 13240.74] you can stay,
[13240.74 → 13241.44] uh,
[13241.44 → 13242.98] doing exactly what you're doing.
[13243.16 → 13243.52] Um,
[13243.58 → 13243.88] the
[13243.88 → 13245.04] the pro is that,
[13245.12 → 13245.46] you know,
[13245.46 → 13246.12] you enjoy it.
[13246.16 → 13247.08] You're going to improve.
[13247.08 → 13249.94] The con is that you might not improve at the rate that you think you're going to,
[13249.94 → 13252.92] because having an injury can affect your form.
[13253.38 → 13254.86] It can affect your performance in game.
[13255.14 → 13256.54] It can affect you mentally.
[13257.16 → 13257.50] It's,
[13257.58 → 13259.52] it doesn't make people happy to not being,
[13259.80 → 13260.50] to not be improving.
[13260.50 → 13260.80] Right.
[13261.18 → 13262.22] You can go cold Turkey,
[13262.22 → 13262.62] which,
[13263.10 → 13263.40] um,
[13263.40 → 13265.04] I think will be best for your recovery.
[13265.42 → 13265.74] Uh,
[13265.74 → 13270.06] or we also presented the option of training on an adjusted schedule on a
[13270.06 → 13271.32] on like at a lower rate.
[13271.56 → 13273.80] And he ultimately made his own decision.
[13274.22 → 13274.66] And,
[13274.72 → 13275.18] uh,
[13275.18 → 13275.40] you know,
[13275.42 → 13277.00] that's the next part is you have to respect it.
[13277.00 → 13278.44] Even if he makes the wrong one,
[13278.52 → 13279.98] because that'll happen.
[13281.50 → 13283.22] You kind of need to go through that too.
[13283.62 → 13283.94] So,
[13283.94 → 13285.00] and you know,
[13285.04 → 13285.28] I've,
[13285.34 → 13285.68] you know,
[13285.74 → 13286.72] realistically guys,
[13286.78 → 13286.96] I,
[13287.02 → 13289.36] I get the opportunity to talk a lot about,
[13289.48 → 13289.90] you know,
[13289.90 → 13290.92] the things that go right.
[13290.92 → 13291.56] And I get to put,
[13291.62 → 13291.76] you know,
[13291.76 → 13292.26] my own,
[13292.38 → 13293.12] my own spin on it.
[13293.12 → 13298.92] I'm sure there are times that my kids have been unhappy with the approach, and I'm sure there are ways that everything that we're doing,
[13298.92 → 13299.52] uh,
[13299.52 → 13300.28] could backfire.
[13300.38 → 13300.60] You know,
[13300.60 → 13303.60] the strategy that works for one kid does not necessarily work for another.
[13303.60 → 13305.34] So don't take all of this as just like,
[13305.40 → 13305.70] Oh yeah,
[13305.88 → 13307.66] mine is thinking he's a perfect parent.
[13307.70 → 13308.34] I don't,
[13308.34 → 13310.84] I make all kinds of mistakes.
[13311.20 → 13312.66] Everyone does be ready for that.
[13315.98 → 13316.54] Own it.
[13317.64 → 13318.36] That's a big one.
[13318.74 → 13319.10] Apologize.
[13320.80 → 13321.16] Seriously.
[13321.16 → 13322.44] When you get something wrong,
[13323.04 → 13324.54] say,
[13324.62 → 13324.98] sorry,
[13325.38 → 13326.40] man,
[13326.46 → 13326.82] I felt,
[13326.92 → 13328.48] I felt bad when,
[13328.48 → 13328.88] uh,
[13328.88 → 13329.06] I,
[13329.16 → 13329.42] I,
[13329.56 → 13333.00] I was so tired of reminding the kids on weekends to brush their teeth in the morning.
[13333.00 → 13334.72] Because they do it automatically on the weekdays,
[13334.72 → 13338.64] but they just get distracted and forget in the mornings on weekends.
[13338.64 → 13340.20] And I came up in the girls,
[13340.24 → 13341.06] hadn't brushed their teeth.
[13341.44 → 13342.62] And I basically went,
[13342.70 → 13342.94] okay,
[13343.26 → 13345.18] no treats this weekend at all.
[13345.56 → 13345.96] Nothing,
[13346.12 → 13347.02] nothing with sugar in it.
[13347.02 → 13347.28] Period.
[13347.96 → 13351.18] I didn't realize one of them was going to a birthday party that day.
[13351.34 → 13351.74] Oh,
[13352.54 → 13355.72] but I said it now that I've said it,
[13355.94 → 13356.50] it is said.
[13357.40 → 13358.74] So she got no cake.
[13359.16 → 13360.30] She got no treats.
[13360.30 → 13361.72] I felt terrible.
[13361.84 → 13363.54] And I know this happened because,
[13363.54 → 13364.24] um,
[13364.38 → 13365.66] Yvonne went to the party with her.
[13366.32 → 13367.58] She got nothing.
[13368.38 → 13369.14] You know what?
[13369.48 → 13371.16] You know how many times she's missed brushing your teeth?
[13373.34 → 13374.02] Goose egg.
[13376.10 → 13377.02] That makes sense.
[13377.22 → 13378.08] But I apologized.
[13378.08 → 13378.54] I said,
[13378.60 → 13378.84] sorry,
[13378.88 → 13382.92] I wouldn't have said that if I had realized that you were going to a birthday party.
[13383.40 → 13383.76] And,
[13383.86 → 13384.14] you know,
[13384.14 → 13385.82] so you kiss and make up,
[13385.88 → 13386.02] right?
[13386.08 → 13387.56] You like,
[13387.60 → 13387.78] Hey,
[13387.78 → 13388.32] I'm sorry.
[13388.32 → 13389.60] But also when I say something,
[13389.68 → 13390.14] it's law.
[13391.28 → 13392.08] It might've been Dan.
[13392.20 → 13392.58] Not sure.
[13393.70 → 13394.08] All right.
[13394.96 → 13395.30] Uh,
[13395.40 → 13396.32] this is the same one.
[13397.00 → 13397.66] I just said,
[13397.70 → 13398.74] there's a comment in Philippine chat.
[13398.82 → 13399.56] Mind paradox said,
[13399.62 → 13400.76] my daughter tried scream,
[13400.86 → 13402.78] shaming me into buying her candy and Walmart.
[13402.94 → 13403.68] When I said,
[13403.74 → 13403.92] no,
[13403.94 → 13406.02] she threw herself on the ground and flailed hands and feet,
[13406.10 → 13407.66] screaming about how I never buy her anything.
[13407.86 → 13408.64] I'm chaotic,
[13408.80 → 13409.56] neutral generally.
[13409.70 → 13413.28] So my response was to throw myself on the ground right next to her and scream.
[13413.40 → 13417.04] I can't afford to buy you everything you want while flailing my hands and feet.
[13417.04 → 13420.60] Her four-year-old self was up in a flash and,
[13420.98 → 13423.22] and from full on tears to screaming to daddy,
[13423.30 → 13423.50] daddy,
[13423.60 → 13424.22] please are looking.
[13424.54 → 13425.40] People are looking.
[13426.86 → 13427.72] That's pretty good.
[13427.90 → 13428.08] Very funny.
[13428.26 → 13429.90] I pulled that once over a donut.
[13430.82 → 13432.74] I was probably about eight.
[13433.56 → 13434.16] Oh yeah.
[13434.20 → 13434.46] Okay.
[13434.58 → 13436.66] That was the one time I was spanked.
[13437.18 → 13438.18] Oh yeah.
[13438.46 → 13438.78] He,
[13438.92 → 13439.22] I've,
[13439.30 → 13439.44] I,
[13439.54 → 13439.72] it's,
[13439.78 → 13440.88] it's like a core memory.
[13441.84 → 13442.32] My,
[13442.32 → 13447.10] my dad immediately dropped whatever groceries we had,
[13447.20 → 13449.04] grabbed me by the arm,
[13449.48 → 13450.22] took me to the car,
[13450.68 → 13452.96] gave me one good one and went,
[13453.62 → 13455.52] don't ever do that again.
[13456.46 → 13457.26] I didn't.
[13457.78 → 13458.16] I remember.
[13458.16 → 13461.12] But I don't agree that that's the way to do it.
[13461.90 → 13462.86] I'll give reminders.
[13463.32 → 13464.60] Like this is one of my favourites.
[13464.60 → 13465.60] You've probably seen me do it.
[13466.08 → 13466.86] I think so.
[13466.94 → 13467.04] Yeah.
[13467.96 → 13470.68] That might've looked lighter than that though.
[13471.22 → 13471.78] Like I've seen you.
[13471.88 → 13472.52] It's pretty light.
[13472.64 → 13473.10] Like it's not,
[13473.20 → 13473.58] it's not,
[13473.68 → 13474.62] no actual pain is.
[13474.62 → 13475.40] So I,
[13475.44 → 13475.84] I,
[13475.84 → 13478.82] I was inspired by watching like a
[13478.90 → 13482.28] like some kind of bird remind it's young about something.
[13483.00 → 13483.58] And so I was like,
[13484.06 → 13484.30] yeah.
[13484.42 → 13487.80] So when they forget like a please or something like that,
[13487.80 → 13488.14] and I,
[13488.20 → 13490.56] I don't want to have to verbally remind them because we're,
[13490.72 → 13493.14] I'll just give them a double,
[13493.30 → 13495.84] a little double index finger tap on the head.
[13496.94 → 13497.62] They're like,
[13497.68 → 13499.46] thank you.
[13499.54 → 13499.68] Or,
[13499.80 → 13500.02] you know,
[13500.06 → 13501.06] or whatever it is.
[13501.84 → 13502.98] I remember these are,
[13503.06 → 13503.62] these are not,
[13503.62 → 13505.72] these are not great,
[13505.80 → 13505.96] but,
[13506.34 → 13506.80] um,
[13507.58 → 13507.88] my,
[13507.96 → 13509.30] my family did spanking.
[13509.44 → 13510.38] It was very common back then.
[13510.38 → 13510.66] I'm not,
[13510.76 → 13511.52] my parents are great.
[13511.62 → 13512.90] I just to be very clear.
[13513.28 → 13513.72] Um,
[13513.76 → 13514.32] but it was,
[13514.54 → 13516.82] once we hit a certain age,
[13516.82 → 13518.96] it was very ineffective on my brother and I,
[13518.96 → 13519.68] uh,
[13519.84 → 13521.88] they were into it.
[13522.04 → 13522.44] We,
[13522.46 → 13524.08] we played a lot of combat sports,
[13524.28 → 13524.96] combat sports,
[13525.04 → 13525.30] contact,
[13525.30 → 13526.14] contact sports.
[13526.50 → 13526.94] Um,
[13526.96 → 13527.98] so like that type of,
[13528.02 → 13528.32] it's just,
[13528.38 → 13528.58] it,
[13528.64 → 13529.36] it didn't matter.
[13529.82 → 13530.26] Um,
[13530.68 → 13533.60] once the like hairbrushes and spoons started breaking,
[13533.62 → 13534.84] and we would just laugh.
[13535.38 → 13535.78] Um,
[13535.86 → 13536.58] that was like,
[13536.66 → 13537.24] you know,
[13537.24 → 13546.92] that like the mental damage being inflicted was significantly heavier on the other end because they're like trying to inflict punishment, and you're just laughing amongst it.
[13546.92 → 13547.30] Uh,
[13547.94 → 13548.20] uh,
[13548.20 → 13553.36] there was also one point in time where my brother did this, and then I copied him because I thought it was funny.
[13553.36 → 13555.08] We ended up doing the thing to be clear.
[13555.16 → 13556.32] We weren't that bad of people,
[13556.48 → 13556.58] but,
[13556.88 → 13557.32] um,
[13557.54 → 13562.16] my mom was like trying to get my brother to do something, and he just laid on the ground and was like, make me.
[13563.88 → 13566.52] Because he's like a huge football player, dude.
[13566.84 → 13567.18] He's like,
[13567.20 → 13567.48] what are you,
[13567.62 → 13568.78] what are you going to do?
[13570.84 → 13571.20] Uh,
[13571.36 → 13571.68] yeah,
[13571.86 → 13573.06] just to taunt them for a second.
[13573.14 → 13573.96] And they did it anyway,
[13574.06 → 13574.74] because he's a good guy,
[13574.80 → 13575.08] but yeah.
[13575.86 → 13576.22] Um,
[13576.94 → 13577.58] Oh man,
[13577.74 → 13578.32] it was great.
[13578.50 → 13578.86] Um,
[13579.08 → 13579.40] okay.
[13579.78 → 13580.14] Evelyn.
[13580.38 → 13580.62] Hey,
[13580.68 → 13581.16] Wanda LL,
[13581.44 → 13582.28] the curling team.
[13582.32 → 13583.88] I coach made it to the league.
[13584.22 → 13584.58] Bon spiel.
[13584.98 → 13588.82] What do you all do to manage performance anxiety after an important win?
[13588.82 → 13590.30] And when the stakes are high,
[13590.40 → 13591.60] I suck at it.
[13592.38 → 13592.62] I,
[13592.68 → 13593.26] I actually,
[13593.26 → 13595.86] I haven't competed much in my life,
[13595.96 → 13596.74] like in competition,
[13596.86 → 13598.34] obviously life is a competition,
[13598.34 → 13599.32] but,
[13599.40 → 13599.66] uh,
[13599.66 → 13600.02] like at,
[13600.08 → 13604.74] at even like stupid recreational badminton tournaments and stuff when it's a big match,
[13604.80 → 13606.20] even not even at a tournament,
[13606.36 → 13608.56] even when I'm playing against like,
[13608.56 → 13612.26] the people who are like realistically too good to play with me.
[13612.76 → 13614.36] And I like to want to do my best.
[13614.56 → 13614.88] I,
[13614.88 → 13615.10] I,
[13615.10 → 13615.68] I get all,
[13615.80 → 13616.16] I get,
[13616.26 → 13616.92] I get tense,
[13617.00 → 13617.24] man.
[13617.34 → 13617.62] I,
[13617.66 → 13617.82] I,
[13617.82 → 13619.00] I really struggle with that.
[13619.10 → 13620.38] I have no advice for you.
[13621.20 → 13621.60] My,
[13621.74 → 13622.02] uh,
[13622.12 → 13625.68] my brother and I both get adrenaline shakes pretty bad.
[13626.16 → 13626.60] Um,
[13627.00 → 13628.70] I find if I'm doing,
[13628.86 → 13634.54] I never even knew this was a problem until I was a bit older because whenever I was in
[13634.54 → 13635.18] sports,
[13635.62 → 13636.70] physical sports,
[13636.70 → 13640.08] it would take care of itself.
[13640.08 → 13640.60] Kind of.
[13640.72 → 13641.78] I don't know why I got,
[13641.86 → 13646.06] I guess the energy was being physically expunged enough that I didn't really get the shake
[13646.06 → 13646.46] so much.
[13646.82 → 13648.18] But if I was in like,
[13648.24 → 13649.86] I used to play counterstrike at a decent level.
[13649.94 → 13651.20] If I was in like a counterstrike tournament,
[13651.40 → 13652.32] my hand would just,
[13652.86 → 13654.92] and it was very frustrating.
[13655.12 → 13656.70] I don't know how I necessarily figured this out,
[13656.82 → 13659.48] but eventually I was still able to make shots while that was happening.
[13659.92 → 13660.78] Just compensate.
[13661.08 → 13661.88] I have no idea.
[13662.20 → 13662.98] Sheer force of will.
[13662.98 → 13663.66] Let's go.
[13663.78 → 13665.18] Brain figured it out somehow.
[13665.50 → 13665.94] Um,
[13666.04 → 13666.98] but it was a
[13666.98 → 13668.28] it was a concern for a while.
[13668.54 → 13669.14] Have fun.
[13669.68 → 13670.94] Remember why you curl.
[13671.38 → 13672.04] There's a
[13672.10 → 13672.54] have fun.
[13672.70 → 13677.38] There's a bit of a trick where if you breathe in really deeply through your nose,
[13677.42 → 13679.76] and then when you've breathed in pretty much as you can,
[13679.92 → 13682.50] pause for a second and then try to breathe in a little bit more.
[13682.50 → 13683.02] Like,
[13683.02 → 13690.34] then breathe out through your mouth, and it's calming.
[13691.00 → 13691.48] That can,
[13691.58 → 13693.46] that can kind of pull you down a little bit.
[13693.86 → 13694.22] Um,
[13694.22 → 13695.18] I've done that before.
[13695.52 → 13697.22] That can genuinely help.
[13697.92 → 13698.28] Um,
[13698.52 → 13700.22] so yeah,
[13700.22 → 13702.66] people are giving it a bunch of different names in full play chat.
[13702.76 → 13703.16] I don't know.
[13703.44 → 13704.94] I just know it works.
[13705.14 → 13706.02] At least it works for me.
[13708.12 → 13709.74] He got used to the pattern of the shakes.
[13709.84 → 13709.98] Yeah,
[13710.00 → 13710.32] maybe,
[13710.42 → 13711.28] I don't know what it was.
[13711.28 → 13711.58] It was,
[13711.58 → 13711.94] it was,
[13711.94 → 13713.34] it was a recoil compensation.
[13713.48 → 13713.60] Okay.
[13713.66 → 13714.76] So I have to draw a seven,
[13714.88 → 13716.58] but like this.
[13718.96 → 13719.40] Yeah.
[13721.88 → 13722.12] Uh,
[13722.12 → 13722.62] Chris asks,
[13722.66 → 13724.44] any idea when water bottles will be back in stock?
[13724.52 → 13724.82] Uh,
[13724.82 → 13725.62] hopefully soon.
[13726.04 → 13726.34] I,
[13726.48 → 13726.72] um,
[13727.04 → 13729.00] I don't know.
[13729.22 → 13729.62] We,
[13729.82 → 13730.24] we,
[13730.44 → 13733.50] the store has grown a lot.
[13733.92 → 13739.52] The business has grown a lot over the years, and we haven't necessarily kept up in our processes.
[13739.52 → 13748.28] And we've got some consultants that started a little while ago that have a lot of experience in retail and business management and going to be kind of helping the team.
[13748.28 → 13748.68] Um,
[13749.60 → 13751.08] Taryn brought them in, and I'm,
[13751.12 → 13753.20] I'm pretty excited for some of the differences they'll be making.
[13753.28 → 13757.32] And I think just sort of inventory management is one of the things that we're going to be looking at how to do better.
[13757.32 → 13760.74] And that doesn't mean that we suck, or we're stupid or anything like that.
[13760.76 → 13763.72] It just means like you're not born knowing anything.
[13764.04 → 13764.24] I think,
[13764.24 → 13765.04] I think it takes time.
[13765.28 → 13765.98] I'm pretty excited about it.
[13765.98 → 13767.68] Because I think like we have,
[13767.80 → 13769.30] we've promoted within a lot,
[13769.50 → 13770.20] which is cool.
[13770.54 → 13771.54] People like that,
[13771.54 → 13773.16] but it does mean that,
[13773.24 → 13773.52] Oh,
[13773.56 → 13774.96] I mean a lot of people that work here have,
[13774.96 → 13775.84] uh,
[13775.84 → 13778.54] at a career level of job have only worked here.
[13779.36 → 13779.84] Uh,
[13779.84 → 13782.56] like I would consider myself only really having worked here.
[13782.56 → 13784.94] I've had a ton of other jobs,
[13784.94 → 13787.54] but they weren't really career jobs.
[13787.54 → 13788.66] They were just jobs.
[13789.28 → 13789.72] Um,
[13789.72 → 13794.72] so that means that we don't have a ton of experience in like how other companies do things,
[13794.72 → 13801.32] which sometimes means that we'll run into a problem and not really necessarily know what to do,
[13801.32 → 13803.76] which we might actually end up on the right answer,
[13803.76 → 13807.72] but it takes some triaging or some trial and error.
[13807.72 → 13809.20] And hopefully we'll end up there.
[13809.62 → 13810.14] Um,
[13810.14 → 13813.20] whereas sometimes people can just come in externally and be like,
[13813.24 → 13813.48] Oh yeah,
[13813.48 → 13816.66] I've worked at like five different companies that are all like Omega big.
[13816.72 → 13817.50] This is how they do it.
[13817.56 → 13817.90] And it's like,
[13817.96 → 13818.14] Oh,
[13818.18 → 13818.38] okay,
[13818.56 → 13818.86] cool.
[13819.38 → 13820.36] Why reinvent a wheel?
[13820.52 → 13820.78] Yeah.
[13821.48 → 13822.92] Sometimes it's worth it.
[13823.18 → 13823.96] Often it's not.
[13824.06 → 13824.20] Yep.
[13824.20 → 13826.64] We've invented a lot of wheels that have been pretty good wheels,
[13826.88 → 13829.18] but sometimes there's a better wheel already.
[13829.54 → 13830.02] Uh,
[13830.20 → 13831.14] Josiah asks,
[13831.24 → 13831.36] hi,
[13831.38 → 13831.58] Mr.
[13831.66 → 13832.86] Tooltips and the gang.
[13832.94 → 13837.62] I recently loved the LTT video on the case swap to the Synchro Q 704,
[13837.70 → 13839.34] which I had to look up to remember what it is.
[13839.36 → 13840.02] It's that one,
[13840.14 → 13842.68] with the one connect power supply from,
[13842.68 → 13843.36] um,
[13843.54 → 13844.10] see Sonic.
[13845.20 → 13845.60] Super,
[13845.80 → 13846.62] super cool.
[13846.96 → 13847.32] Wait,
[13847.46 → 13847.64] no,
[13847.68 → 13848.46] this isn't the right one.
[13849.06 → 13849.58] Oh yeah,
[13849.64 → 13849.78] yeah,
[13849.78 → 13849.92] yeah,
[13849.92 → 13850.04] yeah,
[13850.04 → 13850.16] yeah.
[13850.16 → 13850.38] This,
[13850.48 → 13850.88] this one.
[13850.98 → 13851.08] Yeah,
[13851.10 → 13851.40] exactly.
[13851.48 → 13852.02] This is the one.
[13852.02 → 13855.82] So it has that like a power distribution thing,
[13855.82 → 13856.74] uh,
[13856.74 → 13858.90] from Alex's from Alex's upgrade.
[13859.10 → 13859.54] Anyway,
[13859.68 → 13860.50] the point is,
[13860.54 → 13860.86] uh,
[13860.86 → 13861.48] they ask,
[13861.90 → 13862.28] uh,
[13862.30 → 13863.22] has he had any issues?
[13863.22 → 13864.26] Not that I know of.
[13864.26 → 13864.82] Um,
[13864.92 → 13865.28] also,
[13865.28 → 13869.58] can you do an SFF PC plus theatre setup video?
[13870.24 → 13870.48] Honestly,
[13870.48 → 13872.04] if you have the space for it,
[13872.08 → 13877.74] I wouldn't recommend doing a small form factor for a theatre because you want it to be as quiet as possible.
[13877.74 → 13881.12] And small form factors tend to compromise on cooling.
[13881.52 → 13883.30] So if it was me,
[13883.30 → 13887.36] I would probably go with as big of a
[13887.36 → 13887.88] of a
[13887.88 → 13896.70] of a media sort of friendly looking enclosure as I could get away with in order to have big fans in it that move a lot of air without spinning too fast.
[13896.70 → 13899.18] That would be the best advice that I could give with that said,
[13899.26 → 13906.72] I definitely am going to do a video turning our original steam machine prototype into a home theatre PC at some point.
[13907.22 → 13908.46] We still have it kicking around.
[13908.56 → 13911.34] I want to build like a ripping fast compact machine in it.
[13911.44 → 13912.68] So no,
[13912.82 → 13913.66] but yeah.
[13914.32 → 13915.42] And I think that's it.
[13916.36 → 13918.28] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[13918.50 → 13919.94] We will see you again next time.
[13920.46 → 13920.96] Same bad time,
[13921.02 → 13921.44] same bad channel.
[13921.50 → 13921.62] Wait,
[13921.68 → 13922.14] don't do it yet.
[13922.76 → 13924.56] For float plane subscribers.
[13924.78 → 13925.20] Oh yeah.
[13925.20 → 13926.90] Assuming Dan has it working.
[13927.16 → 13927.68] I don't know.
[13927.74 → 13929.86] Maybe there will be an after party today.
[13930.18 → 13933.50] You can join us for our,
[13934.00 → 13935.98] not traditional.
[13936.18 → 13936.60] What's the
[13936.70 → 13938.76] what's the
[13938.80 → 13939.40] what's the word?
[13939.76 → 13940.50] It's not traditional.
[13940.92 → 13941.40] Customary,
[13941.56 → 13942.32] not customary.
[13942.40 → 13942.86] Give me some more,
[13942.96 → 13943.66] give me some more words.
[13943.76 → 13944.06] Traditional,
[13944.26 → 13944.78] customary,
[13945.24 → 13945.58] ritual.
[13945.94 → 13946.16] Yes.
[13946.28 → 13946.68] Ritual.
[13946.80 → 13947.34] That works.
[13947.42 → 13948.06] That's the one I want.
[13948.46 → 13948.80] Our,
[13948.92 → 13951.70] our weekly super checks ritual.
[13952.30 → 13953.16] Best of what?
[13953.60 → 13953.94] Five.
[13953.94 → 13954.54] Five.
[13954.54 → 13955.02] I mean,
[13955.12 → 13956.10] really for the people,
[13956.26 → 13957.02] for the people.
[13962.52 → 13963.96] My throat's in like a lot of pain,
[13964.40 → 13965.48] but maybe I can do seven.
[13965.80 → 13966.02] Well,
[13966.04 → 13967.22] you have to decide ahead of time.
[13967.32 → 13967.52] You can't,
[13967.52 → 13967.74] I know.
[13967.98 → 13968.84] I hate this.
[13969.02 → 13969.14] Well,
[13969.18 → 13969.54] you can't,
[13969.62 → 13972.64] because you can't decide what it's going to be out of midway through.
[13972.64 → 13978.12] I feel like you can't.
[13978.18 → 13978.40] No,
[13978.46 → 13979.16] you can't.
[13979.16 → 13980.04] Not unless you're tied,
[13980.36 → 13982.54] but then after one game,
[13982.60 → 13983.70] you might not be tied anymore.
[13983.70 → 13986.20] So people are like best of eight.
[13986.32 → 13986.74] Come on,
[13986.78 → 13986.90] you.
[13987.26 → 13987.38] What?
[13988.68 → 13989.04] No.
[13989.62 → 13989.98] Okay.
[13990.04 → 13990.24] I'm,
[13990.24 → 13990.54] I'm,
[13990.54 → 13991.10] I'm,
[13991.18 → 13992.88] I'm going to have to let the people decide,
[13992.94 → 13993.28] I guess.
[13993.44 → 13994.14] Oh my goodness.
[13994.44 → 13994.68] Okay.
[13994.74 → 13995.92] But let's not let the people decide.
[13995.96 → 13996.68] Let's let Luke decide,
[13996.76 → 13999.36] but he'll decide sometime between now and when we start.
[13999.50 → 13999.70] Yeah.
[13999.90 → 14000.36] How about that?
[14000.44 → 14000.74] All right.
[14001.12 → 14001.36] Cool.
[14001.70 → 14001.98] Okay.
[14002.00 → 14003.78] So I guess at least five,
[14004.04 → 14004.94] at least best of five,
[14005.04 → 14006.00] probably best of seven,
[14006.06 → 14006.48] but we'll see.
[14006.76 → 14006.98] Okay.
[14006.98 → 14008.06] So what do we do now?
[14008.08 → 14010.26] I don't know how to end the show anymore.
[14011.32 → 14012.86] I don't know if he wants it to be,
[14012.86 → 14014.64] he was talking about streaming from the other computer.
[14014.78 → 14016.84] So we might need to end the show and then start another one.
[14017.00 → 14017.14] Uh huh.
[14017.90 → 14018.56] But that's okay.
[14018.56 → 14020.26] Because we can spam notifications.
[14020.56 → 14021.68] We're just sending notification of flow plane.
[14021.80 → 14021.92] Yeah.
[14021.98 → 14022.54] So that's fine.
[14022.80 → 14022.98] Yeah.
[14023.58 → 14023.96] Um,
[14023.96 → 14025.38] I'm assuming that's what he wants to do,
[14025.38 → 14026.70] but I don't actually know he hasn't come back down,
[14026.80 → 14028.08] but I don't know how to end the show.
[14028.24 → 14029.68] Like he doesn't have us ended anymore.
[14029.76 → 14030.64] There's a thing he does.
[14031.00 → 14031.32] No,
[14031.36 → 14031.46] no,
[14031.46 → 14032.28] you don't just press that.
[14032.42 → 14033.64] I can probably go figure that out.
[14033.74 → 14034.06] Uh,
[14034.08 → 14034.34] okay.
[14034.40 → 14034.54] Well,
[14034.58 → 14034.98] I mean,
[14035.00 → 14035.14] no,
[14035.18 → 14036.08] you have to be here though.
[14036.80 → 14036.98] Oh,
[14037.00 → 14037.94] to say the thing.
[14038.16 → 14038.42] Yeah.
[14038.48 → 14039.06] So like,
[14039.08 → 14039.62] what do we do?
[14039.84 → 14040.66] I can call Dan.
[14041.06 → 14041.40] Okay.
[14041.90 → 14042.64] Let's do that.
[14048.54 → 14049.52] Speaking of rituals,
[14050.22 → 14051.42] uh,
[14051.42 → 14051.70] what's,
[14051.80 → 14052.00] uh,
[14052.00 → 14053.54] I haven't heard from him during the show,
[14053.54 → 14057.08] so I actually have no idea what his status is.
[14058.08 → 14058.52] Uh,
[14058.52 → 14058.70] uh,
[14058.70 → 14060.64] Oh,
[14068.80 → 14070.20] already added that,
[14070.24 → 14070.52] uh,
[14070.52 → 14073.66] fun idea of Dennis presenting his sponsor spots to,
[14073.66 → 14074.06] uh,
[14074.74 → 14075.74] their content calendar.
[14075.74 → 14078.42] Okay.
[14078.42 → 14078.86] Sounds good.
[14078.92 → 14079.02] Yeah.
[14079.02 → 14080.06] We need you to end the stream.
[14083.06 → 14083.42] Okay.
[14083.42 → 14083.70] Bye.
[14085.08 → 14086.06] We're helpless now,
[14086.10 → 14086.32] Dan.
[14086.36 → 14088.08] We don't know how to do things for ourselves.
[14088.36 → 14088.58] Well,
[14088.60 → 14089.56] apparently it was good timing.
[14089.70 → 14090.72] He was coming down anyway.
[14090.72 → 14091.52] Because I think he's done.
[14091.66 → 14091.90] Oh,
[14091.98 → 14092.38] nice.
[14092.46 → 14093.32] So I think we're good to go.
[14093.80 → 14094.04] Okay.
[14094.12 → 14094.44] Sick.
[14094.90 → 14095.64] That's awesome.
[14096.72 → 14097.98] I did that on purpose.
[14098.10 → 14099.20] Perfect timing on purpose.
[14099.78 → 14100.14] Nice.
[14100.54 → 14101.58] He could tell by the
[14101.58 → 14103.00] the percussion of the footsteps.
[14103.40 → 14103.66] Yep.
[14103.66 → 14104.06] Yeah.
[14104.24 → 14104.88] I could tell.
[14105.14 → 14106.20] Hopefully that wasn't too disturbing.
[14106.50 → 14109.22] I could tell by the angry swearing no longer happening.
[14109.82 → 14110.88] There was a lot of that.
[14112.34 → 14113.32] Pulling my head out.
[14114.60 → 14115.22] Head out.
[14115.76 → 14116.16] Haired.
[14116.30 → 14116.90] I think you mean hair.
[14117.04 → 14117.26] Hair.
[14117.40 → 14117.62] Okay.
[14117.78 → 14117.94] Anyway.
[14118.06 → 14118.40] A lot of that.
[14118.48 → 14118.66] Okay.
[14119.22 → 14119.62] Bye.
[14125.50 → 14126.16] Oh man.
[14126.52 → 14128.26] We need a shirt that just says bye.
[14128.26 → 14128.32] Bye.
[14133.66 → 14134.22] hope.
[14137.22 → 14139.30] Bye.
[14141.60 → 14142.76] Love that.
[14146.86 → 14147.66] Are you sick...
[14147.66 → 14148.14] do.
