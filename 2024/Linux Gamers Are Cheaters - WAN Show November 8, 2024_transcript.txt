[0.62 --> 7.70]  What's up y'all welcome to the WAN show it's been a great week no it's been a great week
[8.56 --> 13.76]  Nope, and it's gonna be a great WAN show. Oh, I wasn't even talking about like world events
[15.70 --> 20.80]  I realize what that probably sounded like now. I wasn't trying. I'm not even we're not even going down that road
[20.80 --> 24.84]  Wow, it took us it took us exactly three seconds
[25.98 --> 27.98]  three seconds
[27.98 --> 30.94]  To alienate some half of America
[30.94 --> 33.74]  I wasn't even talking about and we don't even know which one it is
[35.46 --> 40.98]  Way to go Luke. I was talking about completely not American things. Okay, I will
[41.98 --> 46.46]  Nothing to do with America. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[46.46 --> 54.38]  I forget what the headline one was so Luke might get it for a change AMD is a rocketing upward they have
[54.38 --> 60.34]  Wow, okay, well we'll get into the details later, but yeah, that is absolutely incredible
[61.30 --> 66.54]  EA has ditched support for Linux in apex legends
[67.18 --> 68.38]  citing
[68.38 --> 72.70]  The fact that Linux gamers are far more likely to cheat
[74.94 --> 80.38]  Them some fighting words yoix what else we got this week a modder has made DIY
[81.18 --> 86.94]  Upgradable Mac storage, okay, this is so cool. This is legitimately crazy prices
[86.94 --> 91.66]  We were talking about might not be so bad actually there's a little more to that as well
[91.90 --> 93.90]  We'll get to it intriguing
[93.90 --> 101.34]  The last one I will bring up is that ms paint might be like a cool neat thing to do on your computer again
[102.06 --> 103.26]  Really?
[103.26 --> 107.18]  Maybe they're bringing AI features. They must paint and notepad
[107.18 --> 132.06]  The show is brought to you today by thingiverse. Oh cool. Oh see sonic notion
[132.06 --> 138.78]  Oh, and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our wrap partner dbrand okay
[139.74 --> 141.98]  Small aside. Have you seen my car yet?
[142.54 --> 144.70]  Not in person. I've seen pictures though
[145.58 --> 149.74]  My goodness, okay, anyway, that's all I'll say about me when you get pulled over
[150.22 --> 153.82]  EA is dropping Linux support for apex legends
[154.70 --> 161.42]  Despite the fact that the game was in the top 50 in terms of popularity on the steam deck over the past year
[162.14 --> 168.38]  According to ea developers, it is much harder to catch linux based cheaters and the quote is
[169.02 --> 173.98]  The openness of the linux operating systems make it an attractive
[174.94 --> 181.90]  The openness of the linux operating systems whatever make it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers
[182.46 --> 188.94]  They claim that the impact of linux cheaters was having an outsized impact on other players experience
[188.94 --> 193.90]  And thus ea has decided it is not worth supporting the platform
[193.90 --> 199.18]  I suspect if i'm reading between the lines accurately. I suspect this might also mean that the player base
[200.14 --> 203.26]  Playing on linux is probably not super high either
[203.26 --> 208.46]  But it's very interesting to me that they specifically call out the outsized impact
[208.46 --> 213.74]  Yes, that that small player base is having because the player base can't be that small if you're a top 50 game
[213.74 --> 220.30]  I mean it might not register for a company like ea and one of their halo titles like apex legends, which
[220.94 --> 225.26]  Okay, it's not a halo title. That would be halo, but you get what I mean
[228.78 --> 229.82]  Do it oh
[229.82 --> 238.86]  He wasn't paying enough attention what he wasn't paying enough attention. Oh forget it. Get on the ball dan. I was responding to a horrific merch message. Oh, oh
[239.50 --> 239.82]  uh
[240.70 --> 247.10]  Well, cool. I guess we'll get to that later. Okay. Anyway, the point is we've got a few discussion questions here
[247.10 --> 253.02]  And i'm i'm legitimately interested to hear not just luke's perspective, but i'd like to hear your guys's perspectives as well
[253.02 --> 259.66]  Like if there's anyone who works in game development particularly an anti-cheat development feel free to drop that into the float plane chat
[259.66 --> 261.90]  I'm going to kind of keep an eye out for it. But you know
[261.90 --> 266.30]  The first question is wouldn't more cheat makers be attracted to windows
[266.30 --> 272.70]  Seeing as the paid cheat industry is kind of an enormous industry these days and windows is
[273.98 --> 280.86]  Obviously going to be the platform of choice for most gamers. That's where your biggest player base is if it's a premium thing though
[281.90 --> 285.74]  Like the you know, you have a less likeliness of getting caught if you use this one
[286.30 --> 288.30]  We are the premium specialized tool
[289.02 --> 295.02]  The discerning cheater. I very much suspect that it is but do you do you really think that it was that it is
[295.42 --> 298.86]  More worth it arch during the day cheating at apex legends at night
[299.18 --> 303.82]  Do you really think that it's more worth it to kind of jump through whatever hoops?
[303.82 --> 309.34]  You might have to jump through to become a linux gamer, you know figure out installing linux for yourself
[309.34 --> 310.38]  Which to be clear?
[310.38 --> 314.46]  I'm not i'm not talking about you guys right now. You guys know how to you know
[314.86 --> 319.82]  Use rufus and make a usb drive and install an operating system on your computer on it
[320.06 --> 322.06]  Yeah, exactly exactly
[322.06 --> 326.94]  I mean surely that wouldn't cause the system to immediately brick you did you ever see that video?
[327.58 --> 329.58]  I did nothing wrong
[330.06 --> 336.54]  Except where it tells you that it's gonna break no no different video. Oh, there's a short circuit where I unbox a linux laptop
[336.54 --> 341.26]  I I install steam on it. I did I did nothing
[341.26 --> 345.50]  I just installed steam on it and then it just wouldn't boot up again
[347.26 --> 348.38]  No, I don't think I've seen that
[348.38 --> 350.54]  I have a talent. I have a talent anyway
[351.26 --> 357.02]  Steam you steam and linux in the same room. Yeah, the point is i'm not talking about i'm not talking about you guys
[357.02 --> 360.46]  You can do that. I'm talking about your average like slack-jawed gamer man
[360.46 --> 366.54]  Like I was at pax one year and I was at the nvidia booth and they were showing off this was when they were showing off game stream, right?
[366.54 --> 367.82]  So their wi-fi
[367.82 --> 371.26]  uh game streaming to the to the shop had they launched the shield console yet?
[371.26 --> 372.22]  I don't even think so
[372.22 --> 377.90]  I think it was on the little shield portable that little handheld android box and there's this guy in a beanbag chair
[378.38 --> 382.70]  And uh, I walk up to him and i'm like, hey, like how's the latency on it?
[382.94 --> 384.94]  And he's he's like, I kid you not
[387.50 --> 389.50]  Huh?
[391.10 --> 391.66]  I don't know
[392.78 --> 394.06]  That seems like a cool game
[394.78 --> 395.42]  I'm just like
[396.22 --> 401.50]  Dude, you're in the you're in the nvidia booth. You're trying game stream. It's not even running on that machine. That's like the whole point
[402.38 --> 404.38]  so
[404.38 --> 407.82]  So I guess my point is like so you're you're your average cheater
[408.38 --> 410.38]  Someone in full-blink that said his latency was too high
[410.38 --> 411.42]  It was a little high
[411.42 --> 415.74]  It was a little a little a little high. Okay, we were in the pacific northwest. All right, you know, you probably
[416.62 --> 418.30]  Okay, we got a lot of uh
[418.30 --> 422.38]  He was enjoying a lot of oceans. We got a lot of oceans. Okay, a lot of reefs. Okay?
[426.62 --> 429.74]  He's a reefer. This isn't fair. You can't be this on it when you're sick
[429.74 --> 432.62]  You said it's not the this isn't okay
[432.62 --> 435.18]  You gotta um my goodness
[436.22 --> 437.66]  Anyway, so so so
[438.78 --> 442.38]  If I was to try to kind of profile the person who needs to cheat at games
[442.38 --> 449.66]  See when I was a kid the people who cheated at games were like kids right because they they didn't they weren't good or
[450.62 --> 453.98]  They didn't have they didn't have time to use the computer
[453.98 --> 458.38]  Like I feel like that's kind of flipped around where adults are doing things on their phones
[458.38 --> 459.42]  And like, you know
[459.42 --> 462.46]  The kids just kind of seem to have free reign at their computers and stuff
[462.46 --> 469.34]  Like the adults needed to like use the computer like you were you were fighting over and and right in particular the internet connection
[469.34 --> 474.70]  Yeah, right like the the phone line needed to stay open unless you're I have an important call tonight
[475.34 --> 477.90]  Exactly you can just like be on the internet all the time
[477.98 --> 484.78]  So so you would you could you could cheat and then you could like you could download a diablo trainer and then you could kind of like
[485.34 --> 491.02]  Have your godly plate of the whale i'm so sick now yeah, you know go and fight diablo or whatever right so so
[491.58 --> 499.18]  So the profile that I might have in my in my mind for like a cheater as just like you know an average gamer slash a kid
[499.18 --> 501.18]  Who's not good enough or whatever?
[501.18 --> 507.02]  That's probably just completely wrong right because you got people who are obviously savvy enough to play a game like tarkov
[507.66 --> 509.66]  But obviously feel the need to cheat at it
[509.66 --> 514.46]  So you've got these I guess I've talked myself completely out of my argument now because the amount of work
[514.78 --> 517.50]  That people are seem to be willing to put into
[518.54 --> 520.54]  Not doing the work
[520.54 --> 523.50]  There that's what i'm trying to get at here when you and I were
[525.10 --> 527.10]  Growing up when we were youngins
[527.98 --> 534.62]  Cheaters were it was generally associated with having some amount of knowledge of like software development even if you got the cheat from someone else
[535.66 --> 539.34]  It was it seemed like there was some amount of that's true arcane knowledge
[539.34 --> 544.06]  Like it was a pain in the butt to figure out and the resources to to to research it
[544.06 --> 549.82]  And the amount of trouble you get in from your parents for going on sites that could get the computer a virus
[550.38 --> 556.06]  And now it's like advertised on youtube and twitter and stuff like it's it's a totally different realm
[556.86 --> 557.34]  um
[558.30 --> 563.50]  So I think the like hey this isn't too bad a lot of people actually do this like all the time
[564.14 --> 569.58]  Is the current vibe and when that's the case you might be more willing to actually try the stuff that would be hard
[569.58 --> 572.14]  You know what? I mean installing linux running them that way etc
[574.46 --> 574.86]  Okay
[574.86 --> 576.86]  Decimus roman says
[579.02 --> 585.90]  Nothing decimus roman says I suspect that part of this is that linux doesn't allow video game companies to play the same games
[585.90 --> 587.82]  They do on windows with memory inspection
[588.54 --> 593.18]  Um, but even then the game was a mess on linux and they weren't really making progress and fixing it
[593.18 --> 597.02]  Do you think that linux cheaters are just a scapegoat?
[597.98 --> 600.62]  I've i've i wondered about that a little bit. Um
[602.70 --> 603.50]  Because I do know
[605.26 --> 607.74]  Yeah, the the install base for
[608.86 --> 611.82]  Linux for most games tends to be really low
[612.86 --> 618.70]  I know it's not super common for for developers to want to take linux out of their
[619.50 --> 619.90]  um
[621.18 --> 623.18]  You know supported operating systems
[623.18 --> 625.34]  um mac is the is the worst
[625.66 --> 632.06]  Uh, but linux is is pretty bad for that as well. I've heard that this is much less of a problem now that steam deck is a thing
[632.06 --> 634.86]  Because a higher percentage of your player base does want to be in linux
[635.26 --> 635.66]  um
[636.86 --> 639.26]  But
[640.54 --> 642.54]  I don't know
[642.70 --> 647.82]  So okay hold on um gauntlet wizard says it does allow memory inspection in fact more
[647.82 --> 653.10]  Is it just not supported by their anti-cheat?
[654.54 --> 660.22]  That's a good question. I'm not sure and again that would come back down to just scapegoating not wanting to put in the resources
[660.86 --> 662.86]  whoa
[666.46 --> 668.86]  Is that scapegoating not wanting to put in the resources?
[669.26 --> 669.98]  No, I mean
[669.98 --> 674.62]  I just mean saying because it would still be scapegoating to say it's because of people cheating on the platform
[674.62 --> 680.70]  Well, it is for yeah, so for if if the reason is actually just that they they could deal with it
[680.70 --> 682.38]  But they would just have to put in the work
[682.94 --> 685.50]  um to figure out you know better memory inspection
[686.06 --> 686.78]  um and
[686.78 --> 688.22]  yeah, is that scapegoating though?
[688.22 --> 692.70]  is memory inspection really the biggest impediment though or would it be more to do with um
[694.30 --> 696.86]  I was gonna say more to do with not being allowed to just
[697.58 --> 701.18]  run at kernel level willy-nilly but even then they probably like could
[703.02 --> 705.02]  Tons of different I learned this from playing tarkov
[705.02 --> 709.26]  There's tons of different types of cheats because you could cheat and this would help you in apex legends a lot
[709.26 --> 714.30]  Actually is knowing where everyone on the map is right. Yeah, you can do that without changing what's in the memory
[715.42 --> 717.42]  You do that just by reading the memory
[718.70 --> 722.46]  I see and there's nothing you can do to prevent something from just reading
[722.46 --> 725.50]  I don't see how you'd do that
[727.42 --> 727.82]  I
[727.82 --> 728.94]  I
[728.94 --> 733.10]  Don't make enough about it. I think it shows up in device manager though. Doesn't it?
[734.46 --> 734.62]  Um
[734.62 --> 742.62]  On windows, I don't like a gauntlet wizard says nobody would let them have root to access it because linux gamers aren't stupid
[742.94 --> 747.74]  But it's like okay, but hold on a second if the game just requires it if the game just requires it
[747.74 --> 753.66]  You either don't play or you do it. Yeah, like what do you well what is your I guess that's my question is what is your proposal?
[754.30 --> 755.90]  for for anti-cheat then
[756.46 --> 758.38]  If if we don't
[758.38 --> 763.42]  Access this stuff if we don't lock it down like and I'm not saying this is the way to you know to
[763.98 --> 765.98]  allow companies to install
[766.06 --> 771.26]  root kits or you know kernel level anti-cheat or whatever else i'm not i'm not saying that's the way i'm just saying okay
[771.74 --> 774.14]  If that isn't the way what what's the other way?
[774.14 --> 777.10]  Like give me give me give me another way
[778.38 --> 780.38]  um
[782.06 --> 788.38]  It's gonna be a yeah windows kernel expert can protect okay. Yeah, so this is more just like people are mainly saying look this
[788.78 --> 790.38]  pretty much seems to come down to
[791.10 --> 793.10]  resource management
[793.26 --> 795.26]  um
[795.34 --> 800.62]  Yeah, I don't know not a cheat developer. I can't say hardware level encryption of processes memory
[800.62 --> 808.70]  Huh? I mean we're talking about like a complete architectural shift then at least for you know, like the open
[809.02 --> 813.50]  You know standards desktop pc. I mean you could you could do that for a console or whatever else
[813.50 --> 816.70]  You're not going to do that on windows at least not for the time being
[817.42 --> 817.82]  um
[819.26 --> 824.70]  Apparently auto hotkey gives you aimbot on apex. I've had i've seen a couple people talk about that
[824.70 --> 832.94]  This is wild dude. I saw someone someone in the chat in float plane chat was saying I I have a friend who's good at uh
[833.58 --> 834.22]  What is it?
[835.26 --> 836.38]  I don't remember what it is
[836.78 --> 839.66]  battlefield cod something. I don't know some game and
[840.14 --> 842.30]  basically he uses cheats because
[843.26 --> 848.06]  He'll get put into lobbies that are too sweaty and he just wants to go around and kill people
[848.62 --> 850.62]  it's like
[851.18 --> 856.62]  Look, I can't tell you so play with bots. I can't tell you who to be friends with and who to not be friends with
[857.42 --> 857.74]  um
[858.62 --> 861.34]  But your friends an asshole so yeah
[863.58 --> 863.82]  Like
[865.10 --> 870.70]  That that it's mathematical. I I genuinely get suspicious of what other
[873.90 --> 877.74]  Like if they if they're if they're okay with that what other things are they okay with you know
[877.74 --> 884.38]  And that that's a bit of a slippery slope because you're expecting every person to be perfect, but it's like it's it's it's concerning
[884.38 --> 885.82]  And there's an easy it would raise a red
[885.82 --> 889.82]  No, there's an easy counter argument the easy counter argument is it's a game
[890.54 --> 892.54]  Does it even really matter that much?
[892.54 --> 894.38]  And then there's an easy counter argument to that
[895.10 --> 897.42]  If someone is willing to lie
[898.06 --> 904.14]  Or cheat or step on someone else when the stakes are so low when it doesn't even matter
[904.14 --> 906.78]  When it hardly impacts them at all
[908.78 --> 913.66]  If it was on the line if it was a big deal would they stand up for what's right?
[914.78 --> 916.78]  Heck no, obviously. Yeah
[916.78 --> 922.78]  Like they were willing to compromise their principles for literally zero personal gain
[923.98 --> 924.46]  nothing
[926.14 --> 928.94]  I don't know just food for thought just food for thought
[929.50 --> 934.78]  Yeah, yeah funny hat says if you wouldn't trust a man with a dollar would you trust him with a million dollars?
[936.06 --> 938.86]  People I'm there. There's someone I stopped playing badminton with
[939.26 --> 940.86]  um because I was
[940.86 --> 947.02]  I was sitting behind their court at a tournament and it was uh it was like 22 20
[947.02 --> 950.22]  so it was like into deuce where you have to win by two points third set
[951.02 --> 951.58]  and
[951.58 --> 953.10]  the other team
[953.74 --> 956.30]  hit a clear over their head and it
[957.26 --> 958.54]  obviously
[958.54 --> 959.34]  um
[959.34 --> 960.46]  landed
[960.46 --> 961.26]  out
[961.26 --> 963.42]  no, it obviously obviously landed in
[964.30 --> 965.18]  and they called it out
[965.18 --> 969.50]  and the way that it works in in recreational tournaments
[970.14 --> 976.94]  is that the line call is the team that is that is on that side you you call your own line calls
[977.34 --> 982.22]  because you're closer you you're the only one who can realistically tell there's no line judges because we don't have
[982.62 --> 988.70]  you know six people to line up down all edges of the court and like check everything because it's just wreck right? Yeah
[988.70 --> 989.26]  um
[989.26 --> 989.42]  um
[990.62 --> 991.02]  and
[991.02 --> 994.22]  what you're supposed to do is if you're not sure you replay the point
[994.94 --> 995.26]  okay?
[995.26 --> 998.46]  If there's a dispute you're supposed to replay the point so the other person was like uh
[999.58 --> 1000.62]  that was
[1000.62 --> 1002.38]  obviously in
[1002.38 --> 1002.78]  um
[1003.66 --> 1004.06]  and
[1004.70 --> 1008.06]  this this person who I had been playing with on a fairly regular basis
[1008.54 --> 1012.54]  was like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and like got all aggressive about it
[1013.02 --> 1016.54]  and declared themselves the winner of the game and the other people being
[1016.54 --> 1017.42]  you know
[1018.94 --> 1019.90]  non-confrontational
[1019.90 --> 1023.34]  and just being like dude this it's a game like what is
[1023.90 --> 1028.14]  what are we even what are we even doing here they backed down because they were like this is this is ridiculous
[1028.86 --> 1030.30]  and I was like
[1030.30 --> 1031.34]  yeah, that's uh
[1031.34 --> 1032.06]  I
[1032.06 --> 1032.94]  I would never
[1033.82 --> 1036.14]  I will never play with that person again
[1036.70 --> 1036.94]  I
[1036.94 --> 1039.98]  I will never set foot on a court with that person because you are just
[1041.26 --> 1043.26]  you're a dishonest person
[1043.26 --> 1048.70]  uh, you have shown your character more clearly than any words you could ever say
[1048.70 --> 1049.74]  yeah, um
[1050.46 --> 1053.50]  especially in such a like not that it makes it better in a competitive
[1054.62 --> 1054.78]  uh
[1057.98 --> 1064.94]  game but like it's just it's it it feels almost worse that it was like a casual recreational match
[1065.58 --> 1067.98]  yeah, you know, like I just I don't know
[1067.98 --> 1071.66]  I mean in so well, and you know what? No, no, I think that's a fair point because
[1071.66 --> 1073.34]  in a professional league
[1074.14 --> 1075.66]  part of the gamesmanship
[1076.86 --> 1081.10]  like literally I had this I had this like nhl card game when I was a kid
[1081.98 --> 1082.94]  and um
[1082.94 --> 1083.74]  I don't know if you ever heard of that
[1083.74 --> 1089.02]  one of and and so what what would happen is like you could like you would it was like a deck game and you would
[1089.02 --> 1091.82]  well, I mean any card games a deck game whatever just calm down the point
[1091.82 --> 1096.70]  and it wasn't a deck building game it was a card game so so you would you would draw your cards and so you could um
[1096.70 --> 1100.62]  um you could play shot and the other person would have to have a save
[1101.74 --> 1108.86]  okay or or they could play a hook and then I could play um
[1110.30 --> 1116.14]  the the ref to call the hook oh okay and then you can play behind the ref's back
[1116.14 --> 1121.82]  and then the hook wouldn't get called and then my shot wouldn't go in
[1121.82 --> 1127.66]  you know like so there were like multiple ways to defend interesting against a goal okay and so and
[1127.66 --> 1135.74]  and so I guess what I'm trying to say is I think at a professional level there is a there is a certain amount of gamesmanship that is
[1137.10 --> 1144.62]  pushing the boundaries but then that's avoiding detection why you would have a ref or a line judge at that level of competition exactly yeah
[1144.62 --> 1151.34]  yeah so I guess what I'm trying to say is yes at a professional level no I I think I don't I don't really respect it
[1151.34 --> 1158.94]  no I don't like dirty players yeah but I also do acknowledge that that is the expectation and that if
[1159.50 --> 1166.70]  everyone's doing it now it's part of the game yeah and we can we can doesn't mean it's good the dives in soccer are
[1167.34 --> 1173.98]  disgusting and ridiculous extremely detrimental to the credibility of the sport as an outsider who actually
[1173.98 --> 1182.30]  enjoys watching watching football there I'll even I'll even use the proper name for the sport out of
[1182.30 --> 1188.46]  respect women's football soccer whatever it's fun and cool to watch they don't dive yep so as someone
[1188.46 --> 1193.58]  as someone who thinks the game is super cool and I don't see a lot of it and I'm used to hockey
[1193.58 --> 1199.02]  you know so I'm not gonna be I'm not one of the one of those Americans who's like I watch basketball if
[1199.02 --> 1204.38]  there's no scoring for like 18 seconds I'm bored like what's happening why is it why why isn't anybody
[1204.38 --> 1209.98]  scoring that's so big like I like I don't even mind it I don't even mind it I come from hockey I'll
[1209.98 --> 1215.50]  watch a zero I'll watch a nil nil game all the time no problem um I mean I prefer scoring I think we all
[1215.50 --> 1222.14]  do but but but but I like the tension you know I like the tension but it yeah really it really takes me out
[1222.14 --> 1228.70]  of it dude it takes me out of it in a big way oh yeah when it just feels like instead of watching
[1228.70 --> 1235.58]  uh a sports competition I'm watching a freaking like high school level acting competition yeah it's
[1235.58 --> 1240.86]  pathetic I I was trying to get into it at one point in time yeah if I wanted to watch that immediately
[1240.86 --> 1244.30]  turn it off the second someone I'd watch youtuber apology video duels
[1244.30 --> 1251.98]  that'd actually be kind of a funny uh a funny concept for a video how well would ours do uh I
[1251.98 --> 1257.58]  don't know I didn't pewdiepie review it did he I think so I don't know I think so I have no idea
[1258.30 --> 1263.50]  I wonder what he said I don't remember I probably looked at it at some point
[1266.54 --> 1272.62]  mick leggins says well you're still around hey uh all right then I guess uh then I guess uh I guess
[1272.62 --> 1278.70]  I'd probably do pretty okay um what now
[1281.58 --> 1287.34]  how big is this creator oh no what what is this what is this what is this
[1291.58 --> 1291.90]  yeah
[1294.30 --> 1297.34]  is this seriously the last video they uploaded too like this
[1297.82 --> 1302.38]  what is this this left it off on a banger dude 2.4 million views I didn't mean to click on the video
[1302.38 --> 1304.70]  teamu lmg clips or oh man
[1311.34 --> 1313.42]  what is this what are you looking at
[1315.74 --> 1317.34]  now that's content baby
[1320.22 --> 1324.62]  how did they how did they get my brain in videos
[1324.62 --> 1331.74]  relatable
[1333.66 --> 1336.22]  what the heck oh man
[1336.22 --> 1337.50]  Dan hit me with that before I forget
[1338.62 --> 1339.50]  is that my key thanks
[1340.30 --> 1340.94]  oh okay
[1341.90 --> 1343.74]  oh man I forgot what I was even trying to find
[1343.74 --> 1344.70]  oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1344.70 --> 1353.66]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah why not
[1353.66 --> 1355.58]  it's it's healthy
[1355.58 --> 1357.34]  I'll be in the Tuesday
[1357.34 --> 1358.14]  I'll be in the Tuesday
[1358.14 --> 1358.30]  just screaming
[1360.78 --> 1361.98]  oh my goodness
[1361.98 --> 1363.02]  all right um
[1364.38 --> 1369.34]  so here's my here's my last sort of question coming back to the whole
[1369.34 --> 1372.30]  is it just because linux gamers are cheaters
[1373.26 --> 1378.78]  I guess if it's just like if it's just like a scapegoat thing linux people linux people are
[1378.78 --> 1383.42]  cheaters or or if it's just and and the real reason is we don't feel like doing the work
[1383.90 --> 1389.74]  then why are so many other anti-cheat games not bothering is it also just because they don't
[1389.74 --> 1390.86]  feel like putting in the work
[1390.86 --> 1397.10]  stuff uh I wouldn't be too surprised um I'd be interested to hear from actual anti-cheat
[1397.10 --> 1404.62]  developers because honestly I don't know but I'm thinking about you know how much work it is to
[1404.62 --> 1411.58]  even try to keep up with the cheating community as anti-cheat developers uh because you're you're kind
[1411.58 --> 1418.38]  of like I'm making assumptions here not an anti-cheat developer yeah you're kind of you have to sort
[1418.38 --> 1423.90]  of be reactive yeah oh I would think so that sucks I mean you're gonna try to get out ahead of it
[1423.90 --> 1427.98]  sure but like I'm sure you have some developers that are pushing trying to get ahead some developers
[1427.98 --> 1432.70]  that are pushing to try to be reactive but we've talked about this before where certain departments
[1432.70 --> 1438.22]  are revenue generating departments and other departments are considered you know more like
[1438.22 --> 1443.90]  boat anchor departments and if I'm if I'm a game developer I'm looking at my anti-cheat not as
[1443.90 --> 1449.42]  a revenue generation department but as like a as as a burden as something that I need to
[1449.98 --> 1455.18]  well usually anti-cheat is a separate company uh sorry but you're you're still gonna sorry sorry
[1455.18 --> 1459.10]  sorry uh you're still gonna have internal people that are responsible for the implementation you're
[1459.10 --> 1465.66]  still gonna have internal people that are uh working to make sure that the game actually functions with
[1465.66 --> 1471.58]  the third party um and so this is something that by and large and there's still gonna be a limit to how
[1471.58 --> 1476.46]  much you're gonna want to pay your third party anti-cheat so in terms of the the investment
[1476.46 --> 1483.98]  you're making an anti-cheat it's not a gonna pay 50 percent more to have linux compatible to counter
[1483.98 --> 1490.62]  to counter how much cheat developers can charge for their services right so what we're looking at is a
[1490.62 --> 1499.02]  situation where the investment in cheating software is is a revenue generating department an exciting
[1499.02 --> 1507.34]  department whereas the investment in anti-cheat is like a burdensome we have to do this so we can sell more
[1507.34 --> 1514.54]  hopefully the the the players don't scream too much yeah exactly um and so you're always gonna i i just feel
[1514.54 --> 1519.98]  like you're always gonna be on the back foot that way um and and there's a really there's a really
[1519.98 --> 1525.58]  unpleasant comment in the float plane chat someone said because they're lazy and that is just
[1525.58 --> 1534.38]  so unfair to developers i i have had the pleasure of meeting of meeting some game developers and i
[1534.38 --> 1543.42]  haven't met a single one that i would characterize as just lazy yeah um in fact they've felt to me and
[1543.42 --> 1547.50]  this is based on limited interactions none of them are my best friends or anything did you meet the
[1547.50 --> 1553.58]  developers sorry yeah like this is a person who their job is due development yeah well they're not
[1553.58 --> 1558.22]  picking their tasks well i know that's where i'm getting to look he ruined the thing i'm working on
[1558.22 --> 1563.34]  a whole setup here i do specialize at that yeah i mean but but what i'm trying to say is like they've
[1563.34 --> 1570.70]  seemed in every case passionate um and a lot of the time if they're not getting resources if they're not
[1570.70 --> 1577.42]  getting time they're not getting tasked thank you luke on on these things that will that will improve the game
[1577.42 --> 1582.78]  for their community well it comes down to the bean counters that that comes from somewhere to defend
[1582.78 --> 1588.38]  potentially the bean counters sometimes there are business realities that there's nothing that they
[1588.38 --> 1594.14]  can do about if we spend all this time and all this money on this thing that like four people care about
[1594.14 --> 1599.58]  it will cost us an opportunity over here it will come at to the detriment of these other things can i
[1599.58 --> 1605.98]  no longer hire a person to help this other overworked person we have on the team uh can we not give good
[1605.98 --> 1612.22]  raises this year do we have to lay people off because we're out of money um these are questions
[1612.22 --> 1617.58]  that bean counters are trying to do that monolith and it's rough out there right now that monolith
[1617.58 --> 1625.26]  tour was so cool um like the the number of of the of the game i wouldn't say necessarily all of them
[1625.26 --> 1630.94]  were devs but dads and artists um the number of the people that worked on the game that were like
[1630.94 --> 1637.82]  so multi-hatted and uh like they literally did their own combat mocap just like people who worked
[1637.82 --> 1644.30]  in the studio who were like yeah i like i like train karate on my own time i'm going in the
[1644.30 --> 1651.74]  mocap room to like fight with people and like which is so sick that is so cool that was that was a really
[1651.74 --> 1659.50]  cool thing that we did um speaking of things being rough out there dude did you see warner brothers
[1659.50 --> 1669.42]  said they lost a hundred million dollars um hold on lost 100 million i'm working on it uh they lost
[1669.42 --> 1676.22]  yeah here we go multi versus and quidditch champions together contributed aquil and flow plane chat said it's
[1676.22 --> 1682.14]  rough when you do bad decisions i don't disagree i will also say and i'm not saying that you don't
[1682.14 --> 1687.50]  i'm just i think sometimes a lot of the feedback that you hear from that is people that don't
[1687.50 --> 1693.74]  make that level of decision it's also really easy to look at those level of decisions in hindsight and
[1693.74 --> 1698.14]  be like yeah that was obviously stupid i've done stuff that was obviously stupid in hindsight
[1698.14 --> 1706.78]  i don't know can you think of anything uh yeah we can move on
[1713.02 --> 1719.42]  yeah we're good i think i broke him i think there's there's so many things running to his brain right
[1719.42 --> 1725.18]  now it's actually reached a runaway state and he can't bring it back under control
[1725.18 --> 1731.90]  okay what were we even talking about we were talking about the hard r incident oh my
[1734.06 --> 1741.50]  uh which was not that word okay it was not that word yeah yeah yeah that's not a word that i believe
[1742.14 --> 1747.66]  exists in my vocabulary in my life to aquil or whatever trust me i get it and there's a lot of
[1747.66 --> 1753.82]  scenarios where i feel like even if if we're not thinking in a hindsight sense i'm looking at some of
[1753.82 --> 1757.90]  the things some of these companies are doing i'm like oh my that's so incredibly dumb and i mean
[1759.58 --> 1764.46]  it happens i'm not defending all of it i'm just saying sometimes like i don't know it doesn't it's
[1764.46 --> 1770.38]  it's not automatically that this person was just like being a malicious jerk um sometimes they're just
[1770.38 --> 1774.78]  trying to deal with the cards they have and they don't have a great option and they do the one they
[1774.78 --> 1778.70]  think is best and none of them were good and that one sucks and people are mad it's what was that
[1778.70 --> 1784.70]  channel that you were talking about that like that takes apart the bags and stuff oh yeah did you
[1784.70 --> 1791.26]  watch that because you just like the taste of leather so much or what i just i just couldn't
[1791.26 --> 1795.10]  help noticing that out of the two of us for some reason you're the corporate bootlicker no i'm just
[1795.10 --> 1799.82]  i'm no i'm giving him a hard time my goodness i'm giving all luke's trying to say is that everyone
[1799.82 --> 1804.38]  well everyone's human and i mean that at a variety of levels too right we could be talking about a small
[1804.38 --> 1809.10]  indie game with two people or one person yeah um and i and i mean that all the way up i suspect
[1809.74 --> 1815.10]  the more the company size grows the more it is malicious and bad and dumb decisions i think the
[1815.10 --> 1820.38]  more it is attached too exactly um you have people that don't care about the thing that they're making
[1820.38 --> 1824.86]  they just want more money and and you have people who don't know who the people working on it are
[1824.86 --> 1829.10]  absolutely they don't see them they don't interact with them every day like these these are absolutely
[1829.10 --> 1837.66]  things i'm just saying like i don't know anyway wb games um lost a hundred million dollars on multi
[1837.66 --> 1847.50]  versus and quidditch champions can i just say for a moment that i would be happy warner brothers i would
[1847.50 --> 1856.94]  be happy to work as a consultant for you okay and if you'd like for the small fee of 99 million dollars
[1856.94 --> 1865.66]  oh okay i would be happy to tell you that whether you should make a game or not yeah yeah yeah and
[1865.66 --> 1873.98]  quidditch champions let me let me get let me let me it's a pretty obvious no yeah speaking of speaking
[1873.98 --> 1879.02]  of uh uh bad decisions that we don't need hindsight to have known whether or not i don't know anything
[1879.02 --> 1883.42]  about this game not even sort of surprised it didn't do well why would you buy a quidditch game
[1883.42 --> 1891.90]  quidditch literally is a sport what are the worst thought of sports that was invented by someone
[1891.90 --> 1899.18]  who hates sports i didn't know that i'm not surprised thinks they're stupid and went out of their way
[1899.18 --> 1908.38]  to to make a like a um just terribly designed game uh what what's the word what it's it's it's it's not
[1908.38 --> 1914.22]  parody the it's satire it's it's it's like it's it's it's or maybe it is parody i don't know it's
[1914.22 --> 1919.50]  whatever the word i'm looking for it is it's it's intent caricature that's pretty good thanks ninja dude
[1919.50 --> 1928.30]  it's a caricature of sport it it emphasizes the the weird tribalism to the point where people are cheering
[1928.30 --> 1937.02]  when people get seriously injured or almost killed it it has intentionally arbitrary rules to sort of
[1937.02 --> 1944.30]  to to to highlight how utterly arbitrary the rules can feel sometimes especially if you don't
[1944.30 --> 1951.58]  really understand sports and you don't care to learn about them like it is it is intentionally
[1952.38 --> 1960.94]  stupid and intentionally makes no sense and this is something that isn't even just like a like a retcon
[1960.94 --> 1969.50]  oh yeah you know i totally intended for that plot hole um or you know i intended for those characters
[1969.50 --> 1975.90]  to have an unspoken relationship or you know whatever this isn't just some like random inserted in an
[1975.90 --> 1980.94]  interview five years after the fact this was like well established right early on yeah quidditch is
[1980.94 --> 1985.26]  stupid and that's totally on purpose um yeah
[1985.26 --> 1991.90]  yeah and also like it was one of those games i remember reading about it because there was pretty
[1991.90 --> 1999.98]  much no way for them to win on this because to make the game um true to the sport right like in the
[1999.98 --> 2007.34]  novels and in the movies you you have to it would have to suck yes and you and so you would anger a lot
[2007.34 --> 2014.46]  of the hardcore fans of you know the harry potter universe right and and then to make a balanced
[2014.46 --> 2021.82]  game that would actually play like a decent game at all um well yeah basically you have to completely
[2021.82 --> 2025.98]  change over right so if you make a balanced game you'll you'll you'll screw up with the hardcores
[2025.98 --> 2029.66]  and if you make the game the way that it was in the novels and the way it was in the movies
[2030.38 --> 2036.62]  it'll be completely unplayable yeah to any gamer who's like knows what a rule set is and how the yeah
[2036.62 --> 2042.46]  i've raiden raiden 428 says they should have just done calvin ball at that point yeah dude yeah
[2043.02 --> 2049.98]  i would play the out of calvin ball yeah like okay why not because bill watterson would never license
[2049.98 --> 2060.46]  it that's why that makes sense bill william if i may you know what no i disagree hold on okay hold on
[2060.46 --> 2071.42]  william william okay how about this as a deal how about this as a deal okay you license calvin
[2071.42 --> 2083.74]  and hobbs wait wait wait wait you license calvin and hobbs stop it but but the not-for-profit organization
[2083.74 --> 2093.10]  that runs it okay has like all the safeguards okay it has like capped executive pay for the people who
[2093.10 --> 2103.42]  met stop it for the people who manage the ip okay it contributes literally 100 of its of its yearly proceeds
[2103.42 --> 2112.14]  to the foundation or the cause of your choice um in perpetuity and and and and it just it contributes
[2112.14 --> 2119.98]  in some way in some way just nothing but good to the world with all the profits that it may give me a hobbs toy
[2123.26 --> 2130.78]  i think i think based bill watterson understands that given the erosion of time and entropy
[2131.42 --> 2138.14]  all things are able to become corrupted and wasted well then he knows that as soon as he dies it's going to happen anyway
[2138.14 --> 2149.18]  hold on as long as you can or or don't live to see your your thing that you made ruined or instead of
[2150.14 --> 2155.58]  writing don't allow the hobbit to be made in video in movie form instead of writing that weird
[2156.86 --> 2163.50]  picture book or whatever yeah spend your time spend your time like making it make it setting it up for
[2163.50 --> 2171.10]  coolness before you go man because the world needs more calvin and hobbs did it that'd be cool
[2171.82 --> 2174.46]  well he doesn't want to he's like retired no
[2175.74 --> 2181.74]  un-retire well i would like that too don't make like better this time yeah better this time please
[2181.74 --> 2190.22]  don't make that thing what up dude me yeah i mean what i guess oh
[2192.06 --> 2198.94]  state your request over here what hello oh oh hi uh okay is this live right now yeah yeah why are you
[2198.94 --> 2205.98]  doing this damn i don't know anymore okay bye all right uh dan do you have merch messages for me

[2212.46 --> 2218.22]  ea ditching linux i don't know how we go oh it's happening oh this makes this kind of suck bye is what
[2218.22 --> 2225.74]  it is though we'll uh we'll do what we can anyways uh yeah sure you guys should go away there we go yeah
[2225.74 --> 2233.42]  leave please thank you i love you uh okay let's see what do i got what do we got okay i am so out of it
[2233.42 --> 2240.70]  today i'm so sorry it's okay okay it's okay what do we have i know that there was something dude so
[2240.70 --> 2245.74]  i have to i've i've so the wanshow has been ending slightly early for quite a while because i've had to
[2245.74 --> 2255.26]  do bird meds every day 12 hours apart because it's 12 hours apart and you know you have to go to work
[2255.26 --> 2261.74]  it's basically determined that the latest it could be in the morning it's like 8 30. um so we do birds
[2261.74 --> 2266.46]  med bird meds at 8 30 in the morning that means 12 hours later we have to do bird meds at 8 30 at
[2266.46 --> 2272.46]  night my my girlfriend's gonna be away this weekend so i've had to try to learn how to do
[2273.02 --> 2277.58]  bird meds alone we've had this we've had this strategy where i catch them she gives them the
[2277.58 --> 2282.78]  medicine we're good we we make the room really dark they have really bad dark vision uh humans have
[2282.78 --> 2286.94]  generally better dark vision i can see them i can catch them no problem and i hold them with two hands
[2286.94 --> 2291.10]  so that i have a very nice hold on them where there's no pressure at all they're mostly just
[2291.10 --> 2295.42]  like standing on one of my fingers while i'm just not allowing them to leave and i nicely hold their
[2295.42 --> 2300.22]  head in place and everything's all good and safe and they're generally okay with it i now have to
[2300.22 --> 2304.46]  catch them entirely holding them in one hand and then medicine feed them with my other hand which is
[2304.46 --> 2309.98]  the traditional way to do it it's a hard thing to learn i'm figuring that out right now that's been uh
[2309.98 --> 2319.10]  that's been a that's been a trip um ask for help um like from who who's gonna be able to help me at
[2319.10 --> 2326.86]  8 30 in the morning in my house um what if the other bird helped yeah oh we got a line of spec
[2326.86 --> 2334.22]  already we didn't even get to do a merch message a maneuver that was so fast what did you do sound like
[2334.22 --> 2339.02]  my wife again what did you do uh
[2343.58 --> 2349.90]  i'm good me yeah yeah i got my chips okay yeah yeah yeah that's good all right just making sure
[2349.90 --> 2351.10]  canada hasn't been invaded yet
[2353.74 --> 2356.62]  it's great life is good no what are we talking about uh
[2358.62 --> 2362.94]  i don't think we actually got to immerse messages i was i was buying time we do actually have to explain
[2362.94 --> 2368.06]  merch messages and do a couple so this is probably are we due to do that okay hey merch messages
[2368.70 --> 2374.14]  the best way to interact with the show it's merch messages or just i don't know rolling up and
[2374.14 --> 2379.82]  interrupting apparently because that's what jake does what what a guy what a flipping guy so we don't
[2379.82 --> 2384.30]  do twitch bits we don't do super chats we do merch messages because the way that we see it if you're
[2384.30 --> 2389.74]  going to throw money at your screen hey your screen should throw something right back in your face
[2389.74 --> 2391.82]  that's right
[2393.82 --> 2398.86]  what what did you just throw i don't know it was heavy though it exploded yeah it was pretty exciting
[2399.34 --> 2404.94]  um so the point is that all you got to do to send a merch message which will go to
[2404.94 --> 2410.94]  producer dan over here i wasn't aiming at you dan no it's exploded all over the floor it's fine it's
[2410.94 --> 2413.98]  fine yeah yeah it's good you sound like my wife now
[2417.18 --> 2420.06]  oh don't take a blacklight home the point is
[2422.06 --> 2428.78]  the point is that all you got to do is go on lttstore.com throw something in your cart you'll
[2428.78 --> 2433.58]  see a little box for merch messages you can leave a merch message it'll go to producer dan he'll forward
[2433.58 --> 2437.42]  it to someone answer it himself he'll pop it up on the bottom of the screen or he will curate it
[2437.42 --> 2443.66]  for me and luke to respond to live on the show you don't have to do that anymore do what you got
[2443.66 --> 2448.86]  an operation and everything yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 100 100 now it's just for fun
[2451.58 --> 2455.90]  all right maybe we can wrap up this segment and get into some merch messages well that's what i should
[2455.90 --> 2464.14]  have done yeah that wouldn't be a problem i know you can't be this on it when you're sick you're
[2464.14 --> 2470.38]  setting an unfair bar i'm never gonna be able to do the way to what i'm saying it's ridiculous um
[2471.90 --> 2478.06]  so anyway uh it's in the it's in the cart you check out your merch something we'll reply to it
[2478.06 --> 2483.34]  curated merch messages dan do you want to show a couple of them how it works sure sure sure
[2483.34 --> 2489.58]  uh linus do you still hold your meme stock or did you end up selling it all uh yvonne took it from
[2489.58 --> 2496.94]  me at some point because we needed to shift some cash around at some point um i think we lost money
[2496.94 --> 2503.34]  it was i can't remember the fact i remember that yeah um i remember you i think one of you told me and
[2503.34 --> 2509.90]  i was like oh you like still had that the investment account is empty now not because we lost everything
[2509.90 --> 2516.78]  was it did it come out flat i actually legitimately don't remember anymore but yvonne needed to move
[2516.78 --> 2521.34]  everything that was out of that sort of play money investment account that she let me have
[2521.34 --> 2527.10]  um and she needed to do something responsible oh i think uh to buy the smash champs building yeah
[2527.10 --> 2532.14]  probably yeah i think it was probably the down payment for smash champs it's okay so what okay so i hear
[2532.14 --> 2536.30]  you when you say the the investment account is empty and i i understand how that functionally works but
[2536.30 --> 2540.62]  when you have things like the the nas company and framework like is that because those are
[2540.62 --> 2546.62]  different forms of so so the when i say the investment account is empty market that yeah yeah
[2546.62 --> 2555.82]  okay yeah so i own literally zero dollars in the market in the market yeah however i think uh i think i
[2555.82 --> 2563.90]  have uh an investment in a reit uh i forget i forget what it stands for real estate something t something
[2563.90 --> 2568.78]  it's some kind of like term deposit thing and they like invest in real estate on your behalf or
[2568.78 --> 2577.50]  okay something something like that um so i i have i have a small amount in a reit um i i have the uh
[2577.50 --> 2585.34]  approximately uh quarter mil in framework like 220 or 225 or something like that uh it's a similar
[2585.98 --> 2591.50]  amount in um i don't know if they've have they they've announced their names right the name
[2592.14 --> 2596.62]  hashtag well now it's announced i think so i think there's even a website in the nas yeah in the nas
[2596.62 --> 2605.42]  software company um and that i have real estate holdings and then i own stocks in linus media group
[2605.42 --> 2612.78]  inc this thing yeah hex hex os hashtag yeah it's down at the bottom of the page yeah yep so so that that is
[2612.78 --> 2620.30]  that is it um it's one of those things where i think that there would definitely have been
[2620.30 --> 2631.26]  opportunities for me to do extremely well in tech stocks um but it has seemed a inconvenient and be
[2631.98 --> 2638.62]  extremely um unethical yeah to more morally questionable to participate um i wanted to buy
[2638.62 --> 2645.66]  nvidia back when it was like 17 when i worked at ncix that would have been a pretty good move yeah
[2647.98 --> 2654.06]  it is what it is but yeah you you know you know how it is i think yeah i think holding framework
[2654.78 --> 2659.42]  like ultra mega long term is a little bit different than like diamond hands tech stocks
[2659.98 --> 2666.14]  diamond hands those are very framework the framework was was i wonder what the technical value of that
[2666.14 --> 2671.58]  investment is now i don't know i was gonna say nerov offered to tell me last time i saw him when i was
[2671.58 --> 2677.18]  at computex and i was like dude i actually don't want to know yeah it's not gonna change anything yeah
[2677.18 --> 2687.34]  and the reality of it is even if it even if it doubled even if it quadrupled um it's not it's not
[2687.34 --> 2695.02]  gonna impact our business in any meaningful way like uh where we're not um salary we're not cash strapped
[2695.02 --> 2702.06]  um it's not like we're it's not like we like have a trouble making payroll um you know and and i
[2702.06 --> 2707.98]  feel like now is a good time just like shout out the team like massive massive shout out to the merch
[2707.98 --> 2713.18]  team business team content team i did we talk about this last week we had we had an all hands
[2713.74 --> 2718.46]  we talked about in the all hands yeah we had an all hands earlier this week and um this week was
[2718.46 --> 2731.66]  it was a long week dude was it this week uh yeah holy crap oh my no i'm glad oh no that's not okay
[2731.66 --> 2738.70]  that that's actually we all should not feel like that i'm upset that's actually upsetting what a week
[2738.70 --> 2746.38]  that's crazy um okay we have weird it's weird that the beginning of covid feels like it was like
[2746.38 --> 2751.66]  a couple years ago i know but this week feels like it was a month long yeah i could have guessed at
[2751.66 --> 2757.58]  least two or three weeks yeah so we had an all hands this week and uh i was i was the one of the
[2757.58 --> 2762.86]  quarterly speakers it was mine and yvonne's turn from the exec team to to speak in addition to sort of
[2762.86 --> 2768.22]  taryn giving opening and closing remarks great powerpoint uh thank you thank you very much i drew
[2768.22 --> 2776.70]  our building on fire um and my my point was there's a lot of headwinds coming for us and um so what we
[2776.70 --> 2781.98]  should just give up so it was kind of a it was kind of a little talk about resilience um for the team
[2781.98 --> 2787.90]  and in both directions um you know talking about the resilience we're going to need to have going forward
[2787.90 --> 2794.46]  and also celebrating the resilience that we have shown uh over the last realistically the last few
[2794.46 --> 2802.70]  years which have has involved a hyper growth phase and a shrink phase and then a more gradual
[2803.74 --> 2809.66]  re-clawing our way back to where we were phase and um and i i took a little bit of time to
[2810.22 --> 2817.10]  to shout out um some of the teams that have been essential for that um for that kind of
[2818.38 --> 2823.34]  i don't i don't know what to i don't know what to call it other than just like um like a getting
[2823.34 --> 2833.26]  back on track right um like ltt uh i think i had said was within like 15 percent 10 within 10 percent
[2833.26 --> 2842.22]  of of where views were like sort of last july last june last july um the overall company like the entire
[2842.22 --> 2848.78]  portfolio i think was in was within like 15 or 20 percent viewership wise uh float plane massive
[2848.78 --> 2854.94]  massive shout out to the float plane team uh to the social teams so sammy if you if you floaters are
[2854.94 --> 2860.78]  watching all those exclusives sammy's been killing it man crushing i've really been enjoying crushing it
[2860.78 --> 2866.54]  the full plane content um and and you and you know i mean like sammy doesn't operate in a vacuum you know
[2866.54 --> 2870.30]  you got to give no you got to give credit to the behind the scenes folks right like obviously there's
[2870.30 --> 2873.90]  there's the editors you know the community management like chewy there's the guys that
[2873.90 --> 2878.30]  are working on strategy from the business team um that are helping with all this stuff yeah huge
[2878.30 --> 2885.34]  shout out business team but basically like every team it's kind of been resilient um was was what i
[2885.34 --> 2890.94]  what i had wanted to talk about and i forget where i started on all of this do does anyone remember what
[2890.94 --> 2897.74]  the question was i don't think i remember anymore dan do you still hold meme stocks oh yeah right um
[2897.74 --> 2903.34]  yeah i don't remember how i got here but anyway the team is amazing and thank you all oh right float plane
[2903.34 --> 2913.82]  is back almost up to 40 000 uh 40 000 members which is pretty nuts kind of unbelievable yeah you know if
[2913.82 --> 2919.26]  you think about it because that we we spiked up that high because of the the youtube hack
[2920.14 --> 2925.74]  um and then we you know we thought it was going to decline after the youtube hack because it was such
[2925.74 --> 2932.22]  a crazy spike and we thought that people were at least some of the people coming in had no long-term
[2932.22 --> 2936.62]  intentions even before they saw the platform we were hoping that some of them were going to see it and be
[2936.62 --> 2940.54]  like oh this is actually pretty cool i'm going to stay um that did seem to happen to a surprisingly
[2940.54 --> 2946.22]  large percentage of them but some people were just going to naturally naturally fade out um but to be back
[2946.22 --> 2954.30]  up to near youtube hack levels is like whoa pretty nuts do you remember why i was talking about the
[2954.30 --> 2957.90]  all hands because i don't i got distracted by the fact that i thought that that was like a month ago
[2958.86 --> 2965.26]  no okay cool well anyway uh oh we you you were talking about how the company doesn't need the money
[2965.26 --> 2973.34]  uh oh yeah framework yeah okay so the um the framework thing yeah how did that how did that
[2973.34 --> 2977.42]  figure into that i don't know uh because we were talking about investments you were talking about
[2977.42 --> 2982.22]  how you you could try to sell we were talking about do you do you know the valuation of your investment
[2982.22 --> 2987.50]  oh yeah no i have no idea yeah yeah i have no idea and uh and it doesn't matter all right and it
[2987.50 --> 2992.14]  doesn't matter because i was talking to the team about how like we're kind of back baby yeah
[2992.14 --> 3000.22]  um we had two separate threads two i saw this with a bunch of upvotes i think it was either i think
[3000.22 --> 3007.10]  it was last week on the subreddit that were like yo have you been just like really enjoying the content
[3007.10 --> 3015.50]  lately and people were like yeah it's been it's been and you know what it's been it's been really
[3015.50 --> 3024.30]  heartening uh for the team like today i i read out what i thought was just a really cool comment
[3024.30 --> 3029.74]  on um on one of ploof's recent videos um what what was oh yeah i know what one you're talking about
[3030.46 --> 3034.94]  you do i think i know the comment you're talking about yeah you do how could you possibly know this
[3034.94 --> 3040.54]  this did you did you read through chewy's uh oh no you sent me a comment oh no it's a different one
[3040.54 --> 3049.58]  oh um so this was on uh almost nobody else has the world's best tv and uh they go this channel
[3049.58 --> 3054.46]  is running on all cylinders again the creativity of the skits the edgy jokes the efficient means of
[3054.46 --> 3059.26]  delivering useful information the creation of a culture for tech ltt is putting out some great
[3059.26 --> 3064.30]  stuff lately linus seems like he's in a flow state it's good to see honestly i hope you continue to
[3064.30 --> 3070.78]  create a reputation for quality transparency and fun you guys are killing it um that doesn't happen
[3070.78 --> 3077.58]  with linus in a flow state right like that happens when you've got resilience that happens when you've
[3077.58 --> 3085.58]  got people working hard caring a lot um and just kind of and just kind of bearing down and getting it done
[3085.58 --> 3088.54]  and when i say bearing down and getting it done that doesn't mean that you have to like
[3088.54 --> 3096.22]  be in being like a like a frantic like you know horrible state all the time it means it means
[3096.70 --> 3103.18]  focusing on what we need to be doing and not allowing yourself to get distracted by by negativity
[3103.18 --> 3109.58]  or by um by things that don't matter you know by by little details important stuff unimportant details
[3109.58 --> 3115.10]  one thing i would say as well is when generally when commenters make comments like linus feels like he's in
[3115.10 --> 3121.26]  a flow state or input pretty much anyone else's public facing name it's really what i think
[3121.26 --> 3126.30]  they're generally saying not always obviously but what they're generally saying is like the the
[3126.30 --> 3131.50]  personification of this person which is a bunch of people in the company in a trench coat is doing
[3131.50 --> 3136.86]  well if that makes sense yeah like the this person and the supporting teams around them are doing well
[3136.86 --> 3143.98]  and to be clear not everything is perfect no right like of course not never will be we're not perfect
[3143.98 --> 3151.18]  not everything is going according to plan and nope we still make mistakes sometimes um yep like i think
[3151.18 --> 3161.10]  we called a ryzen 7 or ryzen 5 or something like that core ultra 5285k which is not its name yep yep
[3161.10 --> 3165.42]  and i also misspoke at the beginning of video where i was like amd doesn't really make ryzen 5s and ryzen
[3165.42 --> 3172.70]  3s anymore we were literally reviewing a ryzen 5 my point was amd doesn't really make low-end chips in their
[3172.70 --> 3179.58]  current generation anymore they just like don't bother when the earlier ryzen generations amd brought
[3179.58 --> 3184.62]  their latest tech they brought their a game to budget consumers and now they just don't do it
[3184.62 --> 3191.42]  i misspoke i said ryzen 5 and ryzen 3 when what i meant was ryzen 3 and a very limited lineup of ryzen
[3191.42 --> 3196.86]  5s because they've just kind of hollowed out their low end and i'm sorry i'm sorry um it doesn't change
[3196.86 --> 3201.18]  my point and yeah i should make sure that we're actually you know saying the right words at the right
[3201.18 --> 3209.90]  times in the right order um but yeah i think we're um i think we're doing a lot right overall
[3209.90 --> 3215.42]  and uh i think that there's definitely going to be some some some tweaks for us to continue to make i
[3215.42 --> 3221.50]  think that having the having like the the leadership team in to kind of help focus on the business
[3221.50 --> 3227.82]  things that need to be done so that i can do what i do best which is focus on the content has overall been
[3227.82 --> 3234.70]  a very good thing even though it's been it's been a learning curve it's been a learning curve i had uh
[3234.70 --> 3239.18]  honestly uh yeah i mean whatever i might as well just say i had i had a you know
[3244.78 --> 3252.70]  somewhat short conversation with another member of the leadership team this morning you know this
[3252.70 --> 3262.38]  morning yep we we kind of we kind of chatted through um you know what what my expectations were
[3262.38 --> 3271.10]  in in about a certain thing and like what their expectations were and how we both probably didn't
[3271.10 --> 3278.46]  meet each other's expectations in a way that was conducive to putting forward the best work that we both
[3278.46 --> 3286.94]  could together um and it was constructive that's good but that's the thing is nobody's perfect yeah
[3287.82 --> 3292.78]  nobody's perfect yeah i i speaking of the nobody's perfect thing like like i said we're always going
[3292.78 --> 3297.42]  to make mistakes as a company there's always going to be you know i don't know we're going to do our
[3297.42 --> 3302.46]  best it needs to be better than it is right now but there's always going to be some line here that you
[3302.46 --> 3309.10]  know uh core ultra five there's always going to be that in every once in a while like it's nobody's
[3309.10 --> 3316.30]  perfect right but community wanted that from us for a while so i've i've been in this honestly toxic
[3316.30 --> 3325.42]  habit of checking the ltt subreddit once every couple days in this like what thing is being why are we
[3325.42 --> 3332.62]  being called demonic entities this time and it's been a nice shift in the last few months where it's
[3332.62 --> 3340.70]  just actually like lol some meme or like hey this video is pretty cool and it's like oh we're not evil
[3340.70 --> 3346.78]  well i think by and large they figured out that's great they figured out that um we're like mostly
[3346.78 --> 3354.62]  trying it's just it was yeah yeah it's it's a lot nicer and i'm you know again i'm not expecting
[3354.62 --> 3361.02]  people to not give constructive or critical feedback when there is constructive or critical
[3361.02 --> 3371.10]  feedback to give etc they just it was it was popular and welcomed and praised to crap on us
[3371.10 --> 3375.90]  for like a year oh it still is in some places depending where you go to be fair yeah yeah it's
[3375.90 --> 3380.94]  it's like it's kind of comical at this point because it's like yeah there are there are certain
[3380.94 --> 3384.94]  do you have any idea what other kinds of entities there are in the world that you could direct this
[3384.94 --> 3391.50]  energy at like are you even are you even trying to find something to be legitimately angry about
[3391.50 --> 3398.70]  at this point are you just like have you ever thought about food some random yeah oh man yeah
[3400.30 --> 3406.94]  looked at what goes in your food oh wow have you ever looked into palm oil you know like
[3406.94 --> 3414.14]  do you know do you know what canola oil stands for no um i looked this up recently
[3417.98 --> 3418.46]  where is it
[3423.90 --> 3429.82]  where's its actual name what now it's like canada oil or something like no way yeah
[3429.82 --> 3439.82]  um i think you made that up canola oil get its name from it stands for canada oil low acid no way
[3439.82 --> 3446.94]  yeah a name created by a canadian industry group of rapeseed oil product producers the canola plant
[3446.94 --> 3451.42]  is a type of rapeseed that is low in two compounds that when removed makes its oil healthier and taste
[3451.42 --> 3455.98]  better probably because saying the name of the seed just sucks why would they come up with something
[3455.98 --> 3460.70]  that makes sense yeah that makes sense made out of orphan killing plant
[3462.38 --> 3468.06]  yeah i would i would want to rename that first maybe we should uh go back to the marketing table
[3468.06 --> 3473.98]  you know that would get renamed super fast very quickly i would i would this oil it's gonna it's gonna
[3476.38 --> 3482.70]  it's gonna oil you in the mouth don't worry whoa whoa let's let's let's rename that yeah let's
[3482.70 --> 3487.98]  rename that but we oil into some announcements man yeah um is that what we're supposed to be doing
[3487.98 --> 3493.18]  did we do two merch messages we did one merch message for 45 minutes and now we're gonna do
[3493.18 --> 3499.74]  the announcements and then probably move on to another topic oh wow okay okay announcements i can
[3499.74 --> 3507.42]  see the reddit threads now we're already back to being evil again yeah it's an it's a new r word um so why
[3507.42 --> 3516.70]  why don't you grab a why don't you grab a hoodie okay because i think it's time to relax and get cozy
[3518.78 --> 3527.74]  we went all in on making your new favorite hoodie the aptly named super soft hoodie it's made of a
[3527.74 --> 3534.62]  buttery smooth fabric that our fashion team absolutely fell in love with along with a brushed fleece inside
[3534.62 --> 3542.54]  that feels luxuriously soft it also features a custom big chunk draw cord with an ltt logo engraved
[3542.54 --> 3546.78]  in the end that adds a nice little accent hold on i'm gonna go to the luke cam you want to show them
[3546.78 --> 3554.30]  the big chunk no too comfy oh my god okay um he's really gonna be like that about it what big chunk
[3554.30 --> 3560.14]  i wasn't even paying attention the big chunk draw cord oh these are sweet yeah sure yeah there's the big
[3560.14 --> 3564.70]  so they're like actually huge yeah like the the metal at the end is it's she's chong she's chong
[3564.70 --> 3569.74]  do we have do we have an example of like a normal sweater i don't know because these these are actually
[3569.74 --> 3574.62]  like i have big hands big fingers that's my finger next to it yeah they're chunky they're chunky you'll
[3574.62 --> 3581.58]  have to take my word for it um and of course we have a nice soft kanga pocket to stick your hands into
[3581.58 --> 3587.26]  and something that we go out of our way to add on our hoodies a more secure pocket for your phone or
[3587.26 --> 3591.82]  earbuds you want to show them our classic phone pocket there it is basically we wanted to make
[3591.82 --> 3595.98]  a hoodie that you didn't even have to think twice about throwing on we even chose a color that works
[3595.98 --> 3602.30]  with just about any outfit like if you throw the tech bro vest on top of this guy you're looking snazzy
[3602.30 --> 3612.14]  and warm oh okay he's gonna do that it's available now at lmg.gg slash super soft which this is
[3612.14 --> 3616.46]  apparently a thing i had to get educated this is a thing huh i didn't know that people wore
[3617.34 --> 3621.74]  vests over sweaters okay yeah it's called a sweater vest what are you an idiot no it's not it's not
[3621.74 --> 3626.38]  called that sweater vest is a thing it's a vest that's a sweater so yeah tech bro he's gonna be
[3626.38 --> 3631.58]  boiling in like four seconds i'm going to overheat he'll wear it for as long as he can and die yeah
[3631.58 --> 3635.66]  we're in the studio we're under the lights it's not it's not a good time for a warm boy like luke to
[3635.66 --> 3641.74]  be wearing something like that how quickly do you think emma will steal this oh no i i were you
[3641.74 --> 3648.54]  there dan will it even make it inside the door the second i even felt it i told arty was here and i was

[4191.82 --> 4196.78]  i'm learning about it first don't learn if you don't like what was generated just press try again
[4197.58 --> 4203.10]  wow it will be available on snapdragon powered copilot plus pcs blah blah sign in your microsoft
[4203.10 --> 4212.22]  account etc oh generative erase okay make it look like the object was never there very cool very cool
[4212.22 --> 4220.06]  so let's see boopity boopity gone let's go update the co-creator okay notepad i don't know if i care
[4220.06 --> 4224.46]  as much about let's play around with paint it shall we luke do you want to be the this was
[4225.18 --> 4232.30]  what oh um okay so what should we what should we put in it what should we put in it uh i want to play
[4232.30 --> 4238.54]  with it get it to generate your car generate my car how the how the devil am i going to get it to do that
[4238.54 --> 4252.70]  generate the world's most flashy self-important porsche that you can that you that it can
[4256.70 --> 4262.86]  really luke okay well we'll have to start with image creator then okay rather than the actual
[4262.86 --> 4268.14]  generative fill features whoops let's click the wrong one again okay so image creator uh
[4269.34 --> 4274.86]  man i haven't really used paint much you know lately yeah i was kind of wondering like will
[4274.86 --> 4280.06]  this feature get people to actually use paint again because i i feel like paint's kind of a
[4280.06 --> 4282.38]  bit of a dead meme so it was notepad to be honest but
[4285.66 --> 4292.22]  okay so i want a porsche tycan with a dbrand wrap i mean that's yeah that's what i drive right perfect so
[4292.22 --> 4295.74]  let's see what it comes up with i i don't think it's going to come up with anything this is like a
[4295.74 --> 4302.22]  licensed you know thing potentially wow it's it needs a second here give it give it a second
[4302.22 --> 4303.66]  we're generating we're generating
[4306.30 --> 4315.58]  okay all right yeah i mean i mean yeah that's that's pretty good okay well here let's because
[4315.58 --> 4319.42]  we didn't we didn't say like yeah we didn't say the color let's say it's purple
[4319.42 --> 4326.46]  that that that's pretty good that is pretty that is pretty good that's a very strong start we didn't
[4326.46 --> 4331.90]  say it was purple we also didn't say what skin it looks like a car with a weird custom it's got kind
[4331.90 --> 4338.62]  of uh similar headlights it's missing the like cheetah tear thing a little bit it gives you porsche
[4338.62 --> 4346.62]  vibes though oh yeah def oh 100 okay yeah that one that one does too okay okay sure uh okay purple um
[4346.62 --> 4352.06]  textured damascus steel cool we're getting close yeah we're getting more specific
[4353.34 --> 4359.82]  dbrand wrap okay man that that's not bad okay so let's get our let's get our base image here and then we
[4359.82 --> 4370.30]  can and then we can do some generative fill maybe we maybe we could put a person in the thing or like
[4370.30 --> 4380.70]  make your wheels the your face whoa whoa okay which one do we like the best i feel like that first
[4380.70 --> 4386.78]  one's like getting kind of close i feel like this one's cooler i do feel like that one's cooler dude
[4386.78 --> 4393.34]  that that's super cool i just think that one's more more accurate you know okay all right that one's
[4393.34 --> 4398.70]  got some wacky glitches going on yeah look at this uh look at this situation here yeah i think the wheel
[4398.70 --> 4403.98]  is like in the headlight kind of all right okay so we're gonna go with this guy sure or the or the
[4403.98 --> 4408.14]  cool one i just i think this one's more accurate that one's pretty sick they're both cool let's go
[4408.14 --> 4413.10]  with this one let's go with this one okay so uh we're gonna put you in it or should you be like
[4413.10 --> 4418.14]  crouching in front of it well i don't know luke i don't know i describe what you'd like to create
[4418.14 --> 4425.74]  uh okay so style wait no this is generated art preview image creator co-creator okay well wait do i how
[4425.74 --> 4432.30]  how do i uh how do i do any of this i guess i could have dan do you know uh no i assume that
[4432.30 --> 4436.30]  what you would do is you would do a lasso like uh you've got the selection tool there if you do the
[4436.30 --> 4441.26]  drop down and then go like uh free form there we go and then like highlight something so i'm gonna
[4441.26 --> 4446.38]  i'm gonna ask to put a person like there i guess sure yeah generator filter if you hit the button
[4446.38 --> 4453.66]  uh just underneath the lasso there you go so you could erase or generate film wow that's nice and
[4453.66 --> 4460.62]  intuitive i just guessed yeah i do it describe what you'd like to add like uh uh okay uh person's
[4461.34 --> 4469.50]  head driving this car okay sure create yeah she's uh she's cooking doing something she's cooking
[4469.50 --> 4477.42]  i feel like it's too slow to engage the children maybe not maybe not no okay part of the
[4481.02 --> 4490.30]  that could be part of the fun now it looks like they're like in the not in the driver's seat well
[4491.98 --> 4496.54]  technically i didn't say they need to be in the driver's seat they're not really in any seat
[4496.54 --> 4500.78]  they're kind of in the middle of the car yeah me before coffee they could be
[4502.86 --> 4509.98]  they're like sitting on the armrest kind of i need that as a profile picture it's gonna be my
[4509.98 --> 4521.18]  new team's profile picture oh they're so good i didn't say that he needed to be looking at the road
[4521.18 --> 4528.30]  oh he's looking at a lot of roads yeah uh okay well yeah hold on hold on let's give it let's give it
[4528.30 --> 4533.18]  another try let's give it another try okay okay hold on where's my where's my lasso here okay um
[4533.74 --> 4535.50]  so let's do a let's give her the old
[4539.66 --> 4545.02]  okay so we're gonna generate oh right right right right right right okay here we go um
[4545.02 --> 4554.46]  um okay um a couple put a uh okay dinosaur made out of bread driving a typical porsche driver
[4555.34 --> 4566.06]  in the driver's seat and his sugar baby in the passenger seat come on local fyi that's why it's
[4566.06 --> 4571.42]  slow i'm i'm embracing the stereotypes okay i'm super down what uh oh
[4573.74 --> 4580.38]  what am i looking at what was the prompt wasn't it supposed to be two people oh who is this guy
[4580.38 --> 4586.22]  it's mostly just a smear i think who is this guy i think he's got like pouty lip and like a giant
[4586.22 --> 4592.46]  mustache that really does look like the world's largest mustache it's cyclops upset yeah okay
[4592.46 --> 4598.46]  i like to take it back to for sure because the heated seats don't work wow so that just i think
[4598.46 --> 4605.90]  i think the smaller lasso was definitely the play is chilly okay what what what some of it i feel like
[4605.90 --> 4609.02]  a poor oh oh i want a cool hood ornament
[4615.58 --> 4618.06]  i'm sorry the wealthy don't have chilled buns
[4618.06 --> 4621.66]  my buns are seat temperature
[4623.90 --> 4632.46]  okay unacceptable unacceptable oh website again a super cool and classy
[4633.34 --> 4639.50]  oh apparently there's a try again button oh yeah i probably should have used that that's a good idea
[4640.46 --> 4642.94]  so what are you doing a hood oh well
[4642.94 --> 4648.54]  mm-hmm to be fair you did kind of put it in a you did circle kind of a weird spot for a hood
[4648.54 --> 4652.70]  ornament well no i wanted it to be coming in right here i don't know it's kind of you circled way
[4652.70 --> 4657.82]  above yeah he's kind of she's he's kind of sitting on there i mean you could put a hood ornament there
[4657.82 --> 4664.30]  sure i just needed a second one it's technically on the hood whoops is it is it on the fender oh shoot
[4664.30 --> 4671.90]  i i control zed and it didn't oh yeah yeah i think it's sitting kind of here yeah yeah no for sure
[4671.90 --> 4678.54]  so okay though can i tell it to well here i'm co-create co-creator image can i tell it to like
[4678.54 --> 4687.42]  get another one you know like uh here like can i just like grab this and oh hey it's still paint
[4687.42 --> 4693.66]  yep okay well no that's fine that's fine i i i can use paint here we go what about what about second one
[4694.30 --> 4699.58]  there we go okay so so hold on i've got a plan for this though remove the background there's a plan
[4699.58 --> 4708.94]  yeah yeah yeah yeah so i'm gonna just give it the old merber oh yep well oh what oh man the okay
[4710.22 --> 4711.18]  yeah here we go uh
[4714.46 --> 4723.90]  good luck with this okay but oh uh okay i think i'm about to remove something remove just removes
[4724.30 --> 4729.58]  uh
[4729.58 --> 4737.34]  i mean you know um from far enough away you know you're pretty far you gotta go pretty far away
[4737.34 --> 4744.22]  you gotta go pretty far away from far enough away you have now hit the bird yeah well uh oh i need a
[4744.22 --> 4751.66]  license plate okay i need a license plate on the front because i um and after you do the license plate i think
[4751.66 --> 4757.34]  i'm officially bored yeah that's fair yeah next you get to check out notepad which would be even
[4757.34 --> 4763.98]  more exciting no i'm not doing that i can do that did you want me to do that do we have to do that
[4763.98 --> 4768.94]  though i like a lot oh wow i understand it's not as i didn't realize that it was local that doesn't
[4768.94 --> 4772.46]  seem very impressive good i will someone in flow plane jazz said it is i don't i'm not pretty sure
[4772.46 --> 4779.98]  it is this is a snapdragon yep which is so like that's cool i like local of this stuff that's awesome
[4779.98 --> 4785.50]  so even if it's not as good that's fine i mean it's pretty cool yes that's a license plate on the
[4785.50 --> 4791.02]  car sure is that's a hood ornament it's also on the car that first face might have been a little cursed
[4791.02 --> 4796.54]  but it did kind of look like it was a guy sort of he was in the car somewhere i mean yeah he might
[4796.54 --> 4801.90]  have had the shifter like just wedged between his butt cheeks but um he's not going anywhere yeah
[4801.90 --> 4806.22]  that's safe that's it for safety yep what if you got in a crash you don't want it to accidentally go
[4806.22 --> 4811.82]  backwards when you meant to go forward yeah yeah that's why you got to look both ways at the same
[4811.82 --> 4813.82]  time like that guy that's right that's right
[4818.86 --> 4824.22]  yeah he's safe he's a safe driver so um notepad seriously is there anything to that is important to
[4824.22 --> 4827.98]  look at a notepad i don't know it does like gender-driven stuff if you want to just like
[4827.98 --> 4832.14]  talk about it you can show it i don't know if it's here's what i'm curious about why are we putting
[4832.14 --> 4837.58]  development into notepad and killing wordpad why didn't we just kill notepad and make wordpad better
[4837.58 --> 4841.18]  like what was the what was the rationale here maybe someone from microsoft anyone from microsoft in
[4841.18 --> 4848.70]  the chat do you want to tell me why notepad was the focus please anyone be like they killed the
[4848.70 --> 4855.90]  wordpad because it was probably harder to maintain you think so and then they were able to just ignore
[4855.90 --> 4859.82]  notepad because there was nothing going on so it wasn't gonna break but they aren't ignoring notepad
[4859.82 --> 4865.74]  they're like making i'm saying why they made that decision in the past oh maybe but then
[4867.26 --> 4874.38]  people like me i know it's been very exclusively very committed relationship style using notepad plus
[4874.38 --> 4882.94]  plus for like a decade and will never go back so just like wordpad i know it was i know they killed
[4882.94 --> 4889.74]  it because it was too close to word but i needed a way to open docs without yeah having word like
[4889.74 --> 4895.02]  they're just pushing me straight into the arms of google for one time in the last 12 years i've had
[4895.02 --> 4899.98]  to open a word document i don't have word installed i have no reason to have word installed i would still
[4899.98 --> 4904.22]  like to be able to open this document yeah that's what wordpad was for yeah it was fine it was not bloaty
[4904.22 --> 4911.74]  it was fine open docs is a thing yeah that's fine but the only reason i don't have word is because
[4911.74 --> 4916.06]  i'm just setting up this computer so i don't want to install any software i just want to open this
[4916.06 --> 4920.38]  bloody document because it has the serial for the piece of software that i'm installing or something
[4920.38 --> 4928.78]  like it's just i don't know all right let's do another topic yeah so yeah mspaint it's something
[4928.78 --> 4935.58]  luke what do you want to do amd rockets forward yeah let's do it according to mercury research amd's
[4935.58 --> 4942.94]  desktop cpu market share has climbed 10 in the last year this has manifested most clearly in widespread
[4942.94 --> 4950.38]  reports that the ryzen 7 9800 x3d has sold out at retailers throughout europe and north america and i
[4950.38 --> 4956.06]  mean i'm not surprised if you ask anyone what cpu they should get if they're a gamer they say whatever the
[4956.06 --> 4964.62]  like best x3d chip is and that's just what it's been for a while um anyways uh they have apparently
[4964.62 --> 4970.86]  sold out within minutes on amazon and best buy wow uh newegg has claimed that they are out of
[4970.86 --> 4976.86]  individual units of the 9800 x3d but they they are for some unexplained reason still offering the
[4976.86 --> 4982.62]  9800 x3d plus motherboard bundles that's not an unexplained reason at all i can explain that they need
[4982.62 --> 4993.42]  to sell motherboards yep and amd in there probably they're regretting it now um amd in their sort of
[4993.42 --> 5002.70]  um time of being necessarily pro-consumer um created this expectation of their motherboard sockets lasting
[5002.70 --> 5008.46]  for a very long time so they've created this environment where they launch a new cpu and there's
[5008.46 --> 5018.06]  absolutely no accessory attach sales just new cpus yep um so new is like yeah you're buying
[5018.06 --> 5022.14]  motherboard and a lot of times ram some of their bundles have motherboards and ram that's how they
[5022.14 --> 5027.82]  get you yeah uh further there have been recent reporting that amd's data center business unit
[5027.82 --> 5033.42]  has started out selling intels for the first time in its history though this comes with some caveats
[5033.42 --> 5042.22]  roughly a billion of amd's 3.5 billion in data center sales is accounted for by uh machine learning
[5042.22 --> 5050.78]  machine learning mi uh accelerators and an area that intel doesn't particularly compete in uh without
[5050.78 --> 5057.90]  that key one billion dollars intel's 3.3 billion remains the top spot intel knows i've i've heard i didn't
[5057.90 --> 5063.26]  dive into it i've heard the the the most recent gen of intel server processors are actually quite good
[5063.26 --> 5069.74]  despite their consumer stuff being uh intel knows that they have messed up um i think it would be
[5069.74 --> 5074.62]  pretty hard to not know that at this point but okay um intel knows that they messed up in an interview
[5074.62 --> 5080.78]  with hot hardware vp of technical marketing robert hallick acknowledged the launch of arrow lake didn't
[5080.78 --> 5087.66]  go as planned citing a series of issues uh the company has now identified at an os level and
[5087.90 --> 5095.42]  at the bios level um and saying that the performance we saw in reviews to be very clear no
[5095.42 --> 5104.14]  fault of reviewers was not what we expected and not what we intended um can i interject for a moment
[5106.14 --> 5115.34]  the expectation that you're referring to as not what you expected or as i've been or as i've come to
[5115.34 --> 5120.30]  know it whenever it doesn't matter the point is this is good i can't remember the copy past i have i have
[5120.30 --> 5127.74]  like 300 confirmed kills yeah yeah yeah you you little sorry another copy past don't worry about it um
[5127.74 --> 5133.74]  the point is what are you talking about yeah that that whole line was like what
[5133.74 --> 5145.34]  if you guys didn't have partner boards and you guys can't like launch a game and like
[5146.54 --> 5154.30]  no offense to our team but compared to the kinds of engineering resources oh yeah that intel can afford
[5154.30 --> 5163.58]  we're just a bunch of random bumblef**ks playing with gaming computers like what if you guys can't
[5164.54 --> 5172.78]  contact gigabyte or msi or asus be like hey bro do you mind sending over a motherboard so we can
[5172.78 --> 5180.14]  put a cpu in it and maybe open a f**king game and see if it like gets some fps the tools for evaluating
[5180.14 --> 5188.78]  this stuff they're all free what are you talking about to be clear i believe him i believe that
[5188.78 --> 5194.14]  this whole thing was super rushed i mean and i believe that they they absolutely didn't do the
[5194.14 --> 5199.50]  planning that they needed to execute this launch the way that they needed to execute we did not get
[5199.50 --> 5208.94]  the 265k yeah we had to go buy one after the fact which to be clear that's i can afford yeah i i went i
[5208.94 --> 5215.58]  bought i bought 10 7800x3ds or whatever it was the problem is the availability the problem is that
[5215.58 --> 5221.66]  our job is to bring you guys information about these products so that you can make an informed decision
[5221.66 --> 5229.42]  and intel didn't deem it f**king necessary to send us probably the most compelling chip in the entire stack
[5230.22 --> 5238.46]  so our launch day review just doesn't have any data for it over what like
[5239.58 --> 5245.66]  seriously like like bomb cost of this chip what because so many people are going to need to buy
[5245.66 --> 5254.54]  them just send us like send us like 80 bucks worth of sand and heat spreader so we can have the
[5254.54 --> 5259.58]  numbers for the people if it's really that important to you we can send it back yeah really honestly
[5259.58 --> 5270.78]  what were you thinking sending us the 245k and the 285k and not the middle of the road what were you
[5270.78 --> 5276.30]  thinking bud yeah yeah this didn't go as planned
[5276.30 --> 5283.58]  the performance we saw in reviews was not what we expected dude the last minute changes that we were
[5283.58 --> 5289.90]  getting when maybe what they expected two years ago from this launch maybe i don't know but if that
[5289.90 --> 5293.82]  expectation was set any time even sort of recently like what are you talking about
[5301.50 --> 5309.34]  uh anyway um yeah i don't even notice this our own notes have despite their own arrow lake launch
[5309.34 --> 5316.54]  benchmarks highlighting the new flagship losing to the 14 900k 9950x and 7950x3d
[5316.54 --> 5324.46]  and then we have links to their slides like yeah like this it was my understanding that they knew
[5324.46 --> 5328.38]  this doesn't make much sense i didn't want to talk about like meetings that we had from them but like
[5328.38 --> 5337.66]  like what is this statement here we go where's uh yeah they're literally like yeah we're on par but
[5337.66 --> 5345.50]  like lower power and also we like lose at a lot of games which it's like okay but like personally i
[5345.50 --> 5349.74]  think that's fine it's just not exciting for me to buy it but like you know if you're like hey this
[5349.74 --> 5354.22]  is a massive generational change for us we didn't take as much of a step forward performance wise as we
[5354.22 --> 5358.86]  had hoped but we saved a ton on power and we're hoping that uh we're able to you know but like
[5358.86 --> 5366.70]  literally here's your slide then sure you lose in five games and you win in four like stop it three
[5367.74 --> 5372.62]  no no this one counts is that is that a play oh they didn't make it blue all these other ones are blue
[5372.62 --> 5382.46]  i don't know dude i don't know okay sure it's a lot of really nice praise for our graphs
[5382.46 --> 5389.18]  lately um and especially that that last video so you know shout out um yeah shout out sammy other
[5389.18 --> 5393.90]  more different sammy than the last sammy that i shouted out today um shout out the team for
[5393.90 --> 5401.26]  making graphs that are better than intel can make yeah boom roasted yeah because intel is kind of a big
[5401.26 --> 5406.94]  company i mean not as big as they used to be but they're big well what what what what maybe they
[5406.94 --> 5411.58]  maybe maybe they shouldn't have cantled and sell extreme tech upgrade maybe that was where it all went
[5411.58 --> 5415.90]  down downhill honestly that was that was the beginning of the end i think the timeline of
[5415.90 --> 5420.78]  that lines up pretty well yep if they had just if they had just stuck with intel extreme tech upgrade
[5420.78 --> 5428.06]  this never would have happened yep this is zen kitty says salty liners i'm not salty amd picked it up
[5428.06 --> 5431.66]  right where they left off and uh i don't know if we've ever told amd this but they pay more
[5433.26 --> 5438.14]  well what it was an established series by that point intel had the benefit of that they took a risk on it
[5438.14 --> 5442.38]  yeah and then when amd picked it up it was like well we know this is an absolute banger so uh
[5443.34 --> 5448.06]  time to pony up yeah so yeah it makes sense i feel like we've always been pretty open about that
[5448.06 --> 5456.70]  yeah no man i i don't know we're we're we're we're a highly transparent company and um you know some
[5456.70 --> 5462.62]  people will attack us for that they'll they'll look for points of they'll look for for gaps in the armor
[5462.62 --> 5467.42]  and they'll kind of try and try and wedge something in there and i think but i think most people i think
[5467.42 --> 5473.74]  the silent majority sees what we do and and sees what we're what we're willing to talk about and kind
[5473.74 --> 5477.98]  of goes okay yeah i think i i think i have the measure of who these guys are and what they're about
[5477.98 --> 5484.78]  and that that's the way it is i mean look i've made it very clear at every stage that i'm not friends
[5484.78 --> 5491.50]  with any of these corporations that we cover i never will be and this is transactional they
[5492.14 --> 5497.58]  want exposure on our channel exposure to our audience we clearly disclose what is paid
[5498.70 --> 5503.26]  and that's it there's your talking points it's separate from our from our opinions
[5504.70 --> 5510.62]  it's all on the it's on the up and up uh what else do we want to talk about today oh this is so cool
[5511.26 --> 5520.78]  this is so cool youtuber iboff rcc has created a custom pcb add-on and swappable
[5520.78 --> 5531.42]  ssd modules for m series macbooks this is so cool check this out okay uh blah blah the design
[5531.42 --> 5535.66]  isn't finalized it requires a second mac to run apple configurator to complete the setup because
[5535.66 --> 5541.98]  i don't know apple hates their customers who knows but the diy m.2 port was demonstrated to take modules
[5541.98 --> 5548.62]  up to two terabytes and hit similar speeds to apple's own soldered storage because of course it
[5548.62 --> 5554.62]  does because it's all just hooked up to pcie anyway these days because that's what everybody's using for
[5554.62 --> 5562.06]  everything and this distinction between oh special apple ssd and other more different ssd is completely
[5562.06 --> 5569.42]  unnecessary other than so that they can sell you an ssd upgrade for 200 for like 19 worth of nand
[5570.14 --> 5575.26]  anyway iboff found that strangely the macbook requires the ssd to be installed in order for
[5575.26 --> 5579.26]  the battery to charge which they said was just another reason why the ssd should be replaceable
[5579.26 --> 5585.98]  currently apple charges the same amount for two 16 gigs ram slash 256 gig storage mac minis as it
[5585.98 --> 5590.78]  does for a single mac mini with twice the amount of ram and storage so literally it's costing you twice
[5590.78 --> 5596.94]  as much to just upgrade the ram and storage as an entire machine with half as much ram and storage
[5597.90 --> 5604.46]  now this is cool uh curiously there was that the posts about that had a lot of traction curiously it
[5604.46 --> 5611.42]  seems that the new m4 mac mini does have a single removable storage module however mac rumors notes
[5611.42 --> 5616.30]  that it's likely that the controller for the storage is still embedded in the soc limiting diy upgrade and
[5616.30 --> 5621.34]  repair similar modules have been found in the mac studio and the mac pro anyway i just wanna i just
[5621.34 --> 5632.22]  wanna show this this is so cool i hate that this innovation which is super cool is necessary
[5632.22 --> 5641.18]  i don't understand why apple hates their customers so much and i don't understand why their customers
[5641.18 --> 5649.10]  continue to bend over and take it and be happy about it but the modding is really cool and i've enjoyed that
[5649.10 --> 5655.34]  on this show and in the last show we've been able to highlight some cool community modders that are
[5655.34 --> 5659.50]  finding ways oh sorry sorry sorry his mod was on the macbook that's the mac mini replaceable module from apple
[5659.50 --> 5663.74]  sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry oh that was the wrong pick i was showing hold on hold on i'll find it
[5664.38 --> 5673.82]  my bad you guys uh i have something to go over when you after you find that yeah i thought that didn't
[5673.82 --> 5682.14]  look right i hadn't seen the uh i hadn't seen the m4 mac thing yet you muted me yeah you played that audio
[5682.14 --> 5687.10]  oh yeah yeah yeah i i hadn't seen the uh i hadn't seen the m4 mac mini one yet but i thought that man
[5687.10 --> 5694.38]  that's not what that thing looked like is it yeah here it is dude so cool so you guys got to go watch this
[5694.94 --> 5699.42]  uh here dan do you want to throw the throw the link in everything but floatplane chat i'll throw it in
[5699.42 --> 5709.18]  uh floatplane chat bookmark this go watch it later dude how cool is that yeah love it sick i'll check that out
[5709.18 --> 5715.90]  yeah okay you brought up our graphs looking nice and then you thought they were better than intel's
[5715.90 --> 5719.98]  well i mean it's not that i think they're better than you said it's that intel hates their graphs
[5719.98 --> 5724.94]  aggressively they're unhappy that we're better at intel everything that intel does that we also do
[5724.94 --> 5730.70]  um kidding um can my iphone just like chill out and stop interfering with my mic yeah
[5731.34 --> 5736.46]  um okay i think i'm done with the iphone i'm wondering yeah when are you switching off you said i shot
[5736.46 --> 5745.98]  the video today oh yeah video shot um okay witness you got some you got some silver spray paint yeah yeah
[5745.98 --> 5754.22]  yeah uh i'm interested in your thoughts in how much this adds or doesn't add to the video okay all right
[5754.86 --> 5755.10]  okay
[5758.78 --> 5764.70]  did you see no watch keep watching keep watching keep watching wait for the next one he's i'm sure he's
[5764.70 --> 5771.98]  just talking right now yeah whoa you see what do you think if it's very little work what are your
[5771.98 --> 5774.14]  thoughts then it's super cool oh
[5777.10 --> 5783.66]  yeah if it's very much work do you think would be defined as very little work um
[5785.10 --> 5790.62]  like having the basically having the graph be adamant like this one so the phone that we're actually
[5790.62 --> 5796.86]  talking about gets like kind of inserted in yeah like that so here's my thing um i think if you have
[5796.86 --> 5804.46]  a video that has i would say less than half a dozen graphs then by all means spend the extra 15 minutes
[5804.46 --> 5810.78]  that it'll take to do this to each one or five minutes or whatever it is if you have a video that's
[5810.78 --> 5817.98]  like a cpu review and there's 20 30 graphs i forget it the reason why i'm asking is basically when when
[5817.98 --> 5824.06]  labs is exporting yeah uh graphs and charts and stuff it would be exported in a different format
[5825.02 --> 5831.10]  because it's like okay do we export the ai file so it's modifiable by the editor or do we export just
[5831.10 --> 5840.22]  like a png um i think it looks pretty nice i think it looks pretty nice what you're saying when there's
[5840.22 --> 5845.82]  when there's like like the the the the most recent cpu video that we did yep like the amount of graphs
[5845.82 --> 5850.62]  that were in this that could get that could get cumbersome i could see that and the thing is that
[5851.18 --> 5858.46]  there's probably a lot there's also a lot of lines i'd say a solid 75 of the time on ltt and i'm
[5858.46 --> 5863.50]  going to bring up your laptop here i'd say a solid 75 of the time on ltt when we're uploading a really
[5863.50 --> 5869.58]  graph heavy video it's an embargo video yes we're pushing we are time constrained we're already we're
[5869.58 --> 5876.46]  already crunching yeah so if you tell me yeah we're going to add something unnecessary we're going to
[5876.46 --> 5880.46]  animate it we're going to make it pretty we're going to make it shiny i'm going to say give me a really
[5880.46 --> 5887.10]  really good reason and i'm sorry but pretty is not a good enough reason in this case i don't think that um
[5889.10 --> 5894.54]  i don't think that i see a clear enough benefit now if your team can figure out how
[5895.74 --> 5901.18]  all of that just happens automatically and there's some kind of like slick web interface for
[5902.14 --> 5908.22]  where you just kind of say like highlight this one and then it just like runs a magic behind the scenes
[5908.22 --> 5912.86]  animation thing or something i i don't i don't know this is the one of importance so it does some yeah
[5912.86 --> 5917.26]  i don't know we can explore that type of stuff that is not what that looked like to me that looked like
[5917.26 --> 5920.78]  that wasn't i don't believe that was that that looked like after effects or something like that
[5920.78 --> 5927.82]  i don't know yeah yeah i'm not sure exactly what they used for that gave the file um the only like
[5927.82 --> 5933.98]  honestly and the other thing too is like there's a little bit of if it if it ain't broke don't fix it
[5933.98 --> 5941.58]  in in my response as well people are super happy with this there's things that i would do differently um i
[5941.58 --> 5950.86]  prefer a highlight compared to a dot i prefer i prefer a box i vastly prefer a box a red wireframe
[5950.86 --> 5956.54]  box i don't want to actually highlight it i want it to be around it but i was told that the audience
[5956.54 --> 5962.38]  largely preferred the dot even though for me the dot is much more difficult to track because it moves
[5962.38 --> 5969.66]  in multiple on multiple axes yeah um but you know this is a this is one of those cases where i'm not
[5969.66 --> 5976.54]  just going to i'm not just going to impose my will because at the end of the day who's our boss audience
[5976.54 --> 5976.94]  two
[5976.94 --> 5984.22]  just knocking down what i'm setting up you know how to say anything yeah you'll just he'll you'll just knock
[5984.22 --> 5989.82]  down everything you know what fine i'm gonna give the hints anyway it's not me and it's not taren
[5989.82 --> 5999.90]  there go ahead you can do it again it's dan it's the audience i'm not liking the projections of where
[5999.90 --> 6010.78]  we're going i want more luke huh more luke in videos huh huh um i'm down put me in coach
[6010.78 --> 6022.30]  oh i'm gonna strike the wancho okay yeah anyway um yeah no i yeah it's it's cool but i just don't i
[6022.30 --> 6029.58]  just don't see the um man what would i compare this to that i mean that mac address video only had like
[6029.58 --> 6034.86]  three graphs well that's the thing so yeah it's okay yeah it's um like i could see on a more like
[6034.86 --> 6041.42]  lifestyle channel they're also really early in the video so that's that's something that you guys
[6041.42 --> 6048.54]  will now that i'm gonna say it you're gonna notice it we make much heavier investments in yeah like
[6048.54 --> 6056.70]  you have to more expensive shots locations props um editing in the first like few minutes of a video
[6056.70 --> 6063.26]  compared to what we're willing to do toward the end we aren't operating on the kinds of budgets that
[6063.26 --> 6069.34]  someone like uh you know a mr beast might or whatever so that every every second of the video
[6069.34 --> 6074.22]  is designed with the expectation that you you will be watching it and you must continue to watch it
[6074.22 --> 6079.74]  we're just it's it's like yeah realistically not everyone is going to be into this doing that
[6079.74 --> 6085.02]  server network card so we'll do everything we can to hook you and if it doesn't work it doesn't work
[6085.02 --> 6091.02]  we're kind of we're kind of okay with that protect the server network card from incoming hackers and win
[6091.02 --> 6100.54]  a million dollars the server network card is in a pit the pit is full of snakes oh there's a train coming
[6101.34 --> 6103.66]  what are you gonna do the train's on fire
[6106.06 --> 6111.26]  this is just tech support saw now i don't even watch mr beast videos all of that guessing is just
[6111.26 --> 6120.38]  from his thumbnails oh yeah absolutely oh boy your files are stored on the server it's running right
[6120.38 --> 6127.42]  now you must pull out the hard drive while it's running i hired seven ex-cia members to try to break
[6127.42 --> 6138.14]  into your server room can you keep them out for 24 hours maybe do i get a minigun
[6138.14 --> 6145.90]  uh all right what are we supposed to be um i don't know we're supposed to be doing topics
[6145.90 --> 6152.14]  i keep doing topics until we go to after dark i think nvidia says a hundred hours of gaming ought to
[6152.14 --> 6161.66]  be enough for anyone wrong i mean i'm not necessarily news i'm not necessarily proud that they're wrong but
[6161.66 --> 6169.18]  they are wrong wrong nvidia announced a few changes to geforce now their game streaming service the majority of which were upgrades
[6169.66 --> 6176.38]  the priority membership tier has been rebranded as performance and will now have a max resolution of 1440p instead of 1080p
[6177.34 --> 6184.62]  while remaining at ten dollars a month and it also comes with an ultra wide option super cool wait a hundred hours monthly oh
[6184.62 --> 6190.14]  they're like actually wrong people are actually gonna be upset about that can you stop getting ahead of things no
[6190.70 --> 6199.42]  however both the performance tier and the 20 ultimate tier will now have a 100 hour monthly limit which luke
[6199.98 --> 6207.90]  spoiled what which nvidia says i'm learning about this right now it is doing to avoid global price increases
[6207.90 --> 6218.06]  because some random people are putting in 200 hours a week the limit works out to just above three
[6218.06 --> 6226.46]  hours a day which nvidia says accommodates 94 of their user base nonetheless some users six percent of them
[6226.46 --> 6233.26]  uh did the math for them there uh were extremely unhappy and expressed doubt that 94 of geforce now
[6233.26 --> 6240.70]  users were using it 100 hours a month or less i have some bad news for you guys nvidia is probably not
[6240.70 --> 6245.90]  lying you you actually have a problem you win in those gaming lobbies because you don't do anything else
[6245.90 --> 6252.70]  yeah um which isn't a problem it's okay to have a problem that's not a problem it's just you can quit
[6252.70 --> 6259.74]  you can quit anytime you want yeah nvidia will charge three dollars for an additional 15 hours of performance
[6259.74 --> 6267.58]  and six dollars for 15 hours of ultimate so basically you're paying a third you're paying a
[6267.58 --> 6275.42]  third of your monthly rate for how does that math work it's more expensive oh yeah it's more expensive
[6275.42 --> 6280.78]  why is it more expensive that's stupid i think it would be less expensive yeah no you think it would
[6280.78 --> 6284.62]  be more expensive because the other one is subsidized by the people who use it so little no no that makes
[6284.62 --> 6289.74]  sense yeah it would be more expensive so that's probably closer to what it actually cost them
[6289.74 --> 6294.62]  which interestingly probably gives us some insight into the actual math for how much people are
[6294.62 --> 6303.66]  actually using the service compared to um like if you if you use it so if they can afford what was it
[6303.66 --> 6311.10]  a hundred hours a month for 10 bucks and another 15 hours cost them three dollars then basically what
[6311.10 --> 6315.18]  that means is for every person who's using it a hundred hours you've got people who are barely
[6315.18 --> 6320.54]  touching it uh in order to subscription using zero hours yeah in order to have that math work out
[6320.54 --> 6325.98]  uh oh but very very interesting plus there's some profit margin baked into both calculations probably
[6327.34 --> 6338.06]  um yep live streaming is extremely expensive none of this surprises me at all and especially when you
[6338.06 --> 6346.06]  make it like difficult live streaming it also doesn't surprise me at all that um you know now that
[6346.06 --> 6350.62]  you're locked into a subscription service that subscription service would look to alter the deal
[6351.34 --> 6361.58]  this is why we should probably you know refrain scrapyard wars uh uh like you know a mediocre pc
[6361.58 --> 6366.30]  rather than buy into a subscription service that can be yoinked on us at any time i thought you're gonna
[6366.30 --> 6371.66]  said put up the cost of a float plane subscription yeah yeah spend your money on float plane instead
[6371.66 --> 6379.26]  got them oh how much does wan cost asks luca 103 a bunch i don't think we know exactly do we oh no you
[6379.26 --> 6383.26]  do there's ways to figure it out i don't know yeah top of my head it also changes like per episode
[6383.26 --> 6388.22]  because we'll we'll stream for two hours then we'll stream for four and a half yeah so like i'm gonna
[6388.22 --> 6395.10]  start sending it at 40 meg can you gut sure it actually like why don't we just do it won't make
[6395.10 --> 6402.30]  a difference to be honest no twitch will freak out oh oh yeah well yeah but that's their problem
[6403.34 --> 6408.86]  it's not a pro i mean because what we receive from here oh yeah that actually doesn't matter
[6408.86 --> 6414.78]  oh yeah we transcoded yeah yeah who cares garbage garbage in garbage out though less garbage in less
[6414.78 --> 6420.22]  garbage out let's do it at 8k 8k wan show that actually reminds me man these c200s have been
[6420.22 --> 6426.54]  absolute just workhorses yeah here forever yeah we we used to use these for like trade shows and stuff
[6426.54 --> 6431.18]  and uh we ended up not getting a lot of use out of them there but boy have they ever been great for
[6431.18 --> 6439.98]  the wan show look at that we got all these camera angles it's like oh i've got a c100 at home uh yeah
[6439.98 --> 6445.82]  they're indestructible yeah great little cameras yeah yes i think these c200s are like eight grand
[6445.82 --> 6451.58]  a body though but you know maybe more there's no way they're worth that anymore not anymore absolutely
[6451.58 --> 6458.86]  not okay yeah i i think we did pay quite a lot for them um speaking of quite paying quite a lot for it
[6459.50 --> 6465.10]  uh the dow drops intel intel has been removed from its 25 year position in the dow jones industrial
[6465.10 --> 6470.86]  average i think we hinted to this last week but it has happened i guess uh the go-to benchmark to
[6470.86 --> 6475.98]  measure the health of the u.s stock market being the dow jones industrial average uh this likely
[6475.98 --> 6480.94]  indicates that the maintainers of the dow jones believe that intel's recent struggles are skewing
[6480.94 --> 6487.90]  the average in a way not generally reflective of the market as a whole and they were like damn we
[6487.90 --> 6493.34]  can get in video in here and then they did that its position has been replaced with nvidia which the
[6493.34 --> 6499.82]  s&p dow jones indicates apparently views as a more accurate reflection of the chip making sector
[6499.82 --> 6504.22]  to that i don't necessarily agree with i don't agree with that as much of an anomaly as intel has been
[6504.22 --> 6509.02]  over the last little bit yeah they're just on the other end of it yeah which i understand why you want
[6509.02 --> 6515.58]  that but what you're saying just isn't true anyways um so that's a discussion question uh is
[6515.58 --> 6523.66]  is it really the company that's most reflective of the sector no nice it is a good discussion
[6523.66 --> 6530.94]  question we just got to it too early um oops a network along your skin researchers at carnegie
[6530.94 --> 6537.02]  mellon university have developed a method of transmitting 40 megahertz rf energy along human skin
[6537.50 --> 6545.02]  allowing the user to remotely power extremely small wearable devices that otherwise could not fit a battery
[6545.02 --> 6551.50]  such as a patch that logs medical data whoa this power could be delivered from head to toe from a power source
[6551.50 --> 6560.14]  worn elsewhere on the body startup ixana has created a prototype yr chip that uses a similar method to send
[6560.14 --> 6568.86]  bluetooth slash wi-fi signals through the body's skin thereby connecting multiple devices without broadcasting a wider
[6568.86 --> 6576.54]  potentially insecure signal this would likewise allow users to share a connection
[6579.34 --> 6584.94]  through skin-to-skin contact except like a handshake or a high five you could literally like handshake
[6584.94 --> 6590.78]  someone and like exchange contact information whoa like if you had yeah some like wearable modern
[6590.78 --> 6599.34]  handshakes isn't that cool whoa you touch people says sinful hands i mean yeah well geeks are it's kind of
[6599.34 --> 6608.06]  funny that yeah someone whose name in chat is sinful hands says ew touch people mm-hmm just kind of works it does it
[6608.06 --> 6612.14]  works yeah you're not as on as me today i'm sorry
[6612.14 --> 6622.54]  rude so the discussion question here is what kinds of wearable devices can you imagine with this
[6622.54 --> 6627.50]  technology i mean medical ones i think are obvious we can kind of what about embedded ones too
[6628.38 --> 6633.10]  embedded in the skin well i don't know the signal goes along the skin so you'd almost have to have
[6633.10 --> 6636.94]  i mean that would be kind of cyberpunk looking right because you'd have all the contacts and traces on the
[6636.94 --> 6641.42]  surface interesting and then it's just like you know buried in your muscles somewhere or whatever
[6641.42 --> 6645.66]  else like a uh man i don't know like could you could you
[6648.38 --> 6654.94]  because like if you had a heart rate monitor yeah that didn't increase the bulk along your body
[6655.58 --> 6658.22]  that could be kind of nice yeah that'd be pretty cool
[6660.54 --> 6664.46]  neuro amp what do you guys what are you guys talking about yeah if you had a heart rate monitor that was
[6664.46 --> 6672.06]  powered through you i guess and it could maybe like uh remotely transmit to your phone or something
[6672.06 --> 6679.34]  so you could still check what it's reading be interesting i mean yeah you could say uh powered
[6679.34 --> 6687.82]  tattoos oh that'd be cool e-ink tattoos that would be so cool okay now people are getting me some some
[6687.82 --> 6692.94]  good ideas here imagine a tattoo that changes based on your heart rate yeah and then
[6692.94 --> 6700.78]  oh my god yeah you could have like a little display in your inner inner wrist what about earrings with
[6700.78 --> 6706.86]  lights on them dude you could have comp yeah that'd be sick you you could have complicated like tattoos
[6706.86 --> 6714.38]  yeah reveal different details based on other powered jewelry or like oh man dude you could have so you
[6714.38 --> 6720.06]  could have like a necklace that like changes color with your mood except actually you know not like those
[6720.06 --> 6723.90]  like cheap mood rings or whatever actually based on something but that is like actually based on like
[6723.90 --> 6729.34]  your anxiety level and stuff like that like and and sure yeah the privacy issues but you know people
[6729.34 --> 6735.26]  would do it you know you know people would do it internal cardiac monitors dude this is so cool
[6736.22 --> 6741.90]  i mean my thought is like i'm just surreptitiously touching the back of your neck and stealing all your
[6741.90 --> 6745.98]  data and stuff like that right like dan i shake your hand why you gotta go there with it
[6745.98 --> 6752.94]  who you don't even have the courage to show your face telling us all your ideas about stealing other
[6752.94 --> 6757.18]  people's data and you can't even okay yeah there he is apparently this is a thing already internal
[6757.18 --> 6761.42]  cardiac monitors yeah yeah i think so implantable loop recorders put them in your heart right because
[6761.42 --> 6766.54]  they just run on like super super long yeah life batteries i guess um but but this the cool thing
[6766.54 --> 6771.26]  about it is that you're doing networking and power just over the skin so you just have like a little pack
[6771.26 --> 6776.86]  on your wrist like where a watch would be and it could just power and communicate as almost like
[6776.86 --> 6780.62]  a like a smart home hub like a smart body hub what if it's in your back pocket and then you just sit
[6780.62 --> 6789.26]  down on a wireless charging chair whoa yeah butt charging whoa i mean that would probably be actually
[6789.26 --> 6798.06]  a really good idea so is that like a stick penalty like if they if the center gets attacked if the
[6798.06 --> 6801.02]  quarterback just like runs into the center
[6807.66 --> 6809.66]  what are we talking about uh
[6811.50 --> 6816.70]  anyways um steam moving on yeah steam recording super cool feature
[6818.62 --> 6822.70]  um steam has officially launched built-in game recording which allows gamers to record their
[6822.70 --> 6827.90]  sessions without using a second app players can start a recording manually or set it to start
[6827.90 --> 6831.66]  automatically and there are likewise options to restrict the length quality and storage space
[6831.66 --> 6837.02]  that steam can use these settings can be configured differently for each game however the accessibility
[6837.02 --> 6842.38]  of these recording options and the broader audience of steam users might cause problems for users who are
[6842.38 --> 6850.54]  less familiar with things like ssd degradation as pointed out by u slash crass underscore spectacle steam game
[6850.54 --> 6856.70]  recording has a max write rate of 50 megabits per second around 22 and a half gigabytes per hour if it
[6856.70 --> 6862.78]  was used regularly at the highest settings this could cause significant ssd degradation over time
[6863.58 --> 6867.98]  notably the highest write quality on nvidia's own recording feature maxes out at 150 megabits per
[6867.98 --> 6873.90]  second which is significantly higher but is also something that you generally um is generally a little
[6873.90 --> 6879.66]  more tech savvy to access rather than just what you know your your kids using the family computer are going to be
[6879.66 --> 6884.78]  able to figure out how to configure our discussion question is is this a realistic concern for most
[6884.78 --> 6891.10]  people and um i'm of kind of two minds on this on the one hand yes this will compare to how the
[6891.10 --> 6897.90]  average user is expected to use their pc and what ssd makers have been targeting over the last 10 years
[6897.90 --> 6909.50]  with the move from slc to nlc to tlc to qlc to even plc flash um with far far less endurance as we
[6909.50 --> 6914.30]  as we move yeah to each new generation but higher capacity meaning that you're less likely to
[6914.30 --> 6918.30]  overwrite it but then now that we're going to overwrite it we've we've we've been building
[6918.30 --> 6922.94]  toward we've been building products for this paradigm where people are like kind of occasionally
[6923.50 --> 6928.54]  copying some footage or downloading a new game but generally speaking are barely even
[6928.54 --> 6934.62]  touching their drive which is pretty accurate for rights yeah and then we're adding we're throwing this
[6934.62 --> 6940.14]  into the mix i think i do think that people who didn't think they needed a premium drive
[6940.14 --> 6944.22]  with better endurance are going to suddenly find out oh i do i do need a premium drive with better
[6944.22 --> 6951.02]  endurance however the other side of me wants to point out that it's been studied a couple of times
[6951.02 --> 6956.86]  small sample sizes unfortunately so i don't know how reliable and how trustworthy it is but it's been
[6956.86 --> 6961.74]  looked at a couple of times by i forget which publications have done it where they've done endurance
[6961.74 --> 6966.78]  tests on ssds and found that in general they actually last way longer than what they're rated
[6966.78 --> 6972.54]  pretty good yeah so i also you when i use uh shadow play i just write to my hard drive
[6974.06 --> 6980.62]  sorry i just gotta move my leg there we go but yeah yeah you should probably just use a hard drive for
[6980.62 --> 6985.98]  this yeah in a nas ideally but most people most people don't have a nas i mean they're really very
[6985.98 --> 6991.50]  true there really hasn't been like a na a diy nas software that is easy enough to use that uh
[6994.54 --> 6998.78]  that just anyone who could build their own pc could just install it and be good to go and
[6998.78 --> 7002.78]  configure everything and i gotta cut them up all the shares just work out that's that's the one
[7002.78 --> 7010.38]  that hopefully theoretically i just invested in proxmox oh yeah sure that's easy and approachable for
[7010.38 --> 7020.30]  uh the every man yeah yeah yeah yeah that voice is dan's like i am screaming inside i am also dying oh
[7020.30 --> 7025.34]  it's fine i think it's all of my voices that's a sure let's go
[7029.58 --> 7031.74]  dan switching it over pushing the buttons
[7031.74 --> 7040.46]  all right we got a lot of merch messages today oh not not too too many too many i think we're doing
[7040.46 --> 7048.54]  pretty okay um let's see hey oh dll notice the apple watch accompanying the switch to iphone
[7048.54 --> 7057.58]  linus what do you think of it so far um considering how amped i was on smart watches at the start like i
[7057.58 --> 7066.38]  loved my pebble um i have just kind of completely fallen out of love with them and maybe it's because
[7066.38 --> 7074.06]  the product category sort of moved away from me maybe it's because i moved away from the product
[7074.06 --> 7082.22]  category like it feels like at the beginning they were about getting notifications without taking your
[7082.22 --> 7087.34]  phone out of your pocket and in some cases as they as they got a little bit more sophisticated
[7087.34 --> 7093.02]  interacting with those notifications to to make them go away and and you can still do that like
[7093.02 --> 7097.74]  being able to get a text while i'm while i'm on the court at the gym or something like that and uh
[7097.74 --> 7104.38]  you know fire back a quick message uh it's fine it's good but all the like trying to do too much
[7104.38 --> 7109.34]  all the functionality that they've added since then around you know telling me to stand up but
[7109.98 --> 7113.98]  sure yeah i can't right now i'm in the middle of i'm in the middle of a podcast recording like
[7113.98 --> 7121.66]  you know like it doesn't it doesn't have the awareness to just make the the cameras the table
[7121.66 --> 7126.14]  everything we should just make everything stand yeah everything every 45 minutes sure yeah yeah
[7126.14 --> 7131.74]  let me get let me get right on hell yeah um so all this all this extra stuff that they've added the
[7131.74 --> 7136.46]  health tracking it doesn't it's not meaningful to me i mean when i'm a senior citizen and i'm worried
[7136.46 --> 7141.10]  about you know fall detection or whatever else yeah maybe maybe i'll be more more interested in
[7141.10 --> 7144.86]  something like that but the health tracking that especially apple has been doing is really cool
[7144.86 --> 7148.94]  yeah it's really cool i think not necessarily relevant i think ploof made a really good point
[7148.94 --> 7153.58]  in his uh script where we were talking about their most recent event uh where he was like yeah it's
[7153.58 --> 7159.74]  funny how the older tim apple gets the uh the more seniors health tracking makes its way into their
[7159.74 --> 7166.46]  products it's also aging generation of absolutely western countries absolutely the most affluent
[7166.46 --> 7173.02]  generation in the united states is the baby boomers and they are they're getting older they be old
[7173.02 --> 7179.34]  they're getting older yeah so i i it's nice to be able to tell the time quickly and conveniently on my
[7179.34 --> 7185.26]  wrist you do that with a lot of things i don't like having to charge it every day that's a downer um
[7186.86 --> 7192.62]  you notice i'm not wearing it today i just forgot to put it on and i didn't notice until someone asked me
[7192.62 --> 7199.50]  what time it was that was really the only i don't know maybe part of it is that since i first got a
[7199.50 --> 7205.10]  smartwatch i just am like on my phone a lot more and that that's that that's probably a bad thing
[7205.10 --> 7210.22]  maybe i should get in the habit of using my watch to interact with notifications if it got you off
[7210.22 --> 7218.30]  your phone more often which reduced the total phone and watch usage time then i think that there's value
[7218.30 --> 7223.98]  there yeah but if you're just replacing phone time with watch time one to one i don't see value there
[7223.98 --> 7232.14]  personally i don't use any of the other apps like to me the whole um like i am exercising right now
[7232.14 --> 7239.02]  this is the type of exercise i'm doing until you can just tell that i'm exercising with all of your
[7239.02 --> 7247.26]  advanced sophisticated measures and uh uh sensors and everything what what are we even doing here like i
[7247.26 --> 7253.34]  i it's it's it to me it's like counting calories like i'm i'm logging the thing that i'm eating and
[7253.34 --> 7258.22]  and that's really useful for a lot of people depending on what your goals are like 100 yeah
[7258.22 --> 7266.22]  yeah 100 depending on your goals that has a ton of value for me it has i am not even close dude
[7267.26 --> 7274.06]  i can go take something out of my freezer and think okay i need to go into my food checklist app and
[7274.06 --> 7278.46]  i need to update the inventory in the freezer and by the time i have put it down on the counter
[7278.46 --> 7284.22]  i have completely forgotten that i needed to do that expecting me to count calories or remember to
[7284.22 --> 7289.34]  like log that i'm about to start exercising it's not gonna happen the only way i was not gonna have
[7289.34 --> 7293.66]  able to count calories was when i had pre-planned what i was gonna eat for the entire day
[7294.38 --> 7301.50]  and i never deviated because then it was like okay well i could put in my calories for the next week
[7301.50 --> 7307.82]  you know like it's it's figured out already um someone says they really like it for sleep tracking
[7308.22 --> 7315.34]  um dude if i have to the only way that i can remember to charge something is if it's overnight
[7316.30 --> 7323.34]  so yeah there's people at work here that have an apple watch charger on their desk so they'll take it
[7323.34 --> 7327.98]  off and they'll put it on the charger so that they can use it for sleep tracking i would leave my watch
[7327.98 --> 7333.02]  at work every other day a hundred percent oh yeah there's absolutely no way that it would make it
[7333.02 --> 7337.66]  home five out of five days in a week i'd probably leave it at your house half the time i visit you
[7337.66 --> 7341.50]  oh yeah sure dude you would leave your keys at my house if you were able to leave without them like
[7342.06 --> 7346.38]  yeah 100 that would be a hilarious troll sometimes you just leave your key in your car
[7346.38 --> 7352.38]  and then just like see if you leave without your keys because i i bet you would probably
[7355.10 --> 7355.90]  all right what else we got
[7358.54 --> 7360.14]  okay let's see
[7362.54 --> 7368.86]  archive hey dll my friends and i have a long-running tradition during a land party on black friday every
[7368.86 --> 7374.78]  year what are some of your favorite memories games and food to have at a land party vangeli says new
[7374.78 --> 7379.74]  watch charges so fast i literally only put it on the charger when i shower and otherwise wear it 24 7.
[7379.74 --> 7381.50]  bold of you to assume i shower every day
[7385.10 --> 7390.22]  only only exercise days which is at least every it's about two out of every three days so i'm not
[7390.22 --> 7397.50]  a complete i'm not a complete like barbarian or whatever but um yeah no my my life is not routine enough
[7397.50 --> 7404.46]  for anything that doesn't fit in the very limited routines that i can manage
[7406.22 --> 7409.82]  um star cat one says shower every day man
[7411.50 --> 7418.22]  you you know you don't have to right just i'm just saying i'm just saying you and it and it's
[7418.22 --> 7423.66]  totally fine to shower every day but you also like don't have to or maybe you do which is fine
[7423.66 --> 7433.74]  i'm not judging yeah for me honestly it depends how stressed i get oh stress sweat stinks oh mine
[7433.74 --> 7439.98]  is i'm sure everyone says but i only really have experience with my mind is brutal dude if i'm just
[7439.98 --> 7440.38]  chilling
[7442.86 --> 7448.14]  yeah it's not a big deal slather on another layer of deodorant yeah like probably doesn't really matter
[7448.14 --> 7455.42]  if i have some like really serious conversations boy i need to shower like it's not it's not an
[7455.42 --> 7464.78]  option but at a certain point yeah oh man um lan lan memories games and food dude uh i think it was
[7464.78 --> 7470.86]  like cod 2 which i had never played um i got a bunch of copies of it from work because there was like a
[7470.86 --> 7475.18]  cod 2 like gpu bundle and we didn't move through them all i was like can i have some of these discs
[7475.18 --> 7481.26]  and they were like okay so i showed up at this land and i had like eight copies of cod 2 and we
[7481.26 --> 7485.50]  completely lost track of whatever the objective was supposed to be and we started playing this like
[7485.50 --> 7491.50]  king of the hill except it was like at the very top of this water tower and there was like over half
[7491.50 --> 7496.78]  a dozen of us so it was functionally impossible to get to the top of it i think it it happened that
[7496.78 --> 7502.30]  way because someone got up there unnoticed at some point in the match and just started like spawn
[7502.30 --> 7507.66]  sniping everybody um and we were like what the heck that's a good spot i want it and it just
[7507.66 --> 7513.82]  evolved into the the longest like completely no there's no scorekeeping because it wasn't part of
[7513.82 --> 7520.30]  the game mode of the game but just the longest most ridiculously impossible king of the hill match
[7520.94 --> 7526.78]  that i've ever participated in custom goals custom rules all that kind of stuff those are always like
[7526.78 --> 7532.78]  the best way to play games it's it's more fun my my favorite land memory and i'm not even gonna
[7532.78 --> 7537.50]  remember it correctly because it was from so long ago but uh my birthdays when i was in high school
[7537.50 --> 7544.78]  were always land parties at my parents house and one year we went really hard on halo 2
[7546.06 --> 7552.78]  custom rules versus and we if i remember correctly we we had like it was a birthday party so we we tried to
[7552.78 --> 7560.14]  go a little bit overboard and we we had people bring like couches and tvs and stuff from their houses
[7560.14 --> 7565.58]  and we put if i i think i'm getting this right i could be wrong i think this is how it worked i think
[7565.58 --> 7572.06]  we had two tvs and two couches in the garage and two tvs and two couches inside and there was one team
[7572.06 --> 7578.46]  inside and one team outside and we had a tournament of of halo 2 on one particular map that i'm not gonna
[7578.46 --> 7583.74]  remember the name of um and it was it was either like swords and shotguns or i feel like it was
[7583.74 --> 7588.70]  swords and rockets but i feel like we played more swords and shotguns but i don't know i don't remember
[7588.70 --> 7595.58]  why i'm thinking rocket but it came to it was 49 49 there was two players alive and it came down to
[7595.58 --> 7599.26]  the the there was one with a sword and one with whatever the other weapon was i think it was a
[7599.26 --> 7604.38]  rocket and they both attacked at the same time no way nobody knew who won the game until the score
[7604.38 --> 7613.98]  screen came up no way and the house just exploded it was crazy it was so cool it was so like oh man
[7613.98 --> 7621.26]  like yeah uh it was great it was really it was very fun and like even every part of that land those
[7621.26 --> 7625.50]  types of lands are fun because like people are showing up with couches in the backs of their like
[7625.50 --> 7630.78]  their parents van yeah and their parents are like i don't even understand what's happening but i mean at
[7630.78 --> 7636.70]  least you're not like doing drugs or something so fine and then we're like finding ways to to network
[7636.70 --> 7641.66]  these these two xboxes together and we're not only planning on playing xbox we also have another
[7641.66 --> 7645.90]  network going on for all these computers and we're all learning how this stuff works buying switches
[7645.90 --> 7650.62]  from ncix doing whatever getting stuff going like the whole thing's just super fun i don't know those
[7650.62 --> 7655.42]  were those were good times i feel like kids are kind of missing out on that my my son was playing
[7655.42 --> 7659.42]  rocket league with one of his friends and i was like hey you never invite me to play games he was like okay
[7659.42 --> 7664.30]  yeah my dad's joining us and they're like okay sure whatever we'll carry uh you know how bad i am
[7664.30 --> 7668.62]  at rocket league i did one useful thing though what'd you do i don't know i don't remember i like hit it
[7668.62 --> 7672.22]  somewhere that was useful and then we scored oh okay yeah don't worry about it anyway the point is
[7672.78 --> 7678.70]  um his friend pulled off what's it called a reset or something like that a flip reset sure yeah so he
[7679.26 --> 7682.14]  you touch your wheels to the puck while it's in the air and then you get another jump
[7682.70 --> 7687.82]  i'm assuming that's what happened it so uh it was with the ball it's not a bright i play snow day anyways
[7687.82 --> 7691.66]  anyway the point is you have to touch all four wheels to the ball while you're in the air and
[7691.66 --> 7696.22]  then you get another flip while you're in the air which is beneficial in some way or something yeah and
[7699.02 --> 7702.94]  he was really excited about pulling it off or whatever and um
[7707.74 --> 7715.10]  he was sitting in his house by himself yeah and we were on a discord call and so you know that was cool
[7715.10 --> 7723.50]  but like it's cool it's not the same it's different um yeah i feel like things get diluted right and
[7723.50 --> 7726.62]  like you think it's the same and a lot of people don't do land parties anymore because they're like
[7726.62 --> 7732.30]  oh we just play over the internet and stuff but it's not it's not man and no one can cheat in person
[7733.58 --> 7740.38]  which man is such a problem online now oh you you can but it's like it's a lot harder not with friends
[7740.94 --> 7746.22]  like you can but you won't but like i mean that's yeah and there's even some fun in that because then
[7746.22 --> 7750.78]  i don't know i find the setup of this type of stuff interesting i know not everyone would but like the
[7750.78 --> 7756.22]  whole idea of being in the garage and stuff was there is no screen peeking to screen peek you'd have to
[7756.22 --> 7761.82]  run through the house like it's not happening yeah but you can still hear each other if you look the
[7761.82 --> 7767.34]  door is propped open so you can see each other yeah but the screens are this way to each other right so you
[7767.34 --> 7772.54]  you can't you can't see the screens but you can yell at each other and do whatever yeah it's good
[7772.54 --> 7783.34]  times yeah all right hey dll how's your day going it's been a long week it's been it's been a week
[7784.14 --> 7789.42]  when and what are your plans for bonus pin items i have so many stickers yes i could just get more sticks
[7789.98 --> 7795.10]  uh hope you feel better soon linus um i don't know i think we want to do some like little vinyl figures at
[7795.10 --> 7801.50]  one point i know we're going to do more pins final figures um honestly sarah would know this so much
[7801.50 --> 7806.94]  better than me maybe next time ask when she does like a design stream or something like that because
[7806.94 --> 7809.74]  she's she's in the know when it comes to all of that
[7815.74 --> 7822.94]  are you asking her now should i move on no no i'm i'm i sarah's off work now hey lld from australia
[7822.94 --> 7828.62]  any thoughts on the 9800 x3d not being in stock anywhere was the release rushed in your opinion
[7828.62 --> 7835.74]  not nearly as rushed as core ultra 200 series but um i feel like every product release gets kind of
[7835.74 --> 7840.70]  crunched and rushed to a certain extent it's at a certain point you you have to you're working with
[7840.70 --> 7843.50]  retail partners you're working with all these other people there has to be a certain point in
[7843.50 --> 7849.34]  time when you launch the thing yeah there's deadlines and no i mean it's easier to not have
[7849.34 --> 7853.66]  those types of deadlines with with things like independent game launches because you set the
[7853.66 --> 7858.22]  date but in this situation like there's a lot of moving pieces you're screwing a lot of different
[7858.22 --> 7864.06]  people over if you move your date back so yep or forward or wherever like changing anything really
[7864.06 --> 7870.46]  disrupts the plans and distributors and in such a globalized world right there's there's always a
[7870.46 --> 7874.22]  time zone where it's highly problematic for someone to be having to deal with this right now
[7874.22 --> 7883.58]  hey dll now that you have some new cats when can we expect the next linus cat tips video i uploaded a
[7883.58 --> 7887.82]  short for some reason i was feeling just inspired too and one of them like grabbed my feet from under
[7887.82 --> 7890.78]  the bed and i was like that'd be funny and then they didn't really do it the same way when i turned
[7890.78 --> 7894.22]  on the camera and then i was like ah this wasn't really worth it so i didn't bother doing anymore
[7896.78 --> 7901.66]  that's where i'm out on that fair enough yeah hey dll have you heard about the iphone users having
[7901.66 --> 7906.86]  all their notes deleted after accepting icloud's new terms of service i had six months of important
[7906.86 --> 7915.42]  notes not backed up due to my five gigs of icloud being full wow i have not heard uh but hey it just
[7915.42 --> 7923.26]  works uh dude i feel like i'm gonna make some enemies with my ios 18 slash iphone 16 i know you will
[7923.26 --> 7931.74]  video i um i am i am certain i because man i uh like there's one point where i'm just like
[7932.38 --> 7938.78]  i think the next time someone tells me it's magic it just works whatever i i don't know if i'll be
[7938.78 --> 7944.38]  able to help it i might just laugh in their face like i it's just it's such a it's such a like
[7944.38 --> 7950.86]  galactically stupid thing to say at this point and i'm not saying that android is perfect and just
[7950.86 --> 7954.86]  works and i'm not saying windows is perfect and just works i'm saying they're all trash
[7954.86 --> 7962.94]  they're all human they're all full of bugs and problems like let's just let's just not pretend
[7962.94 --> 7971.18]  that's that's it let's not pretend that because someone says it so that it must be thusly like
[7971.18 --> 7973.02]  that's not how things work if something
[7973.02 --> 7981.18]  like uh and i think the thing that i was going off on was uh the way to sign in to your google
[7981.18 --> 7987.18]  account on an iphone um which i know how to do and and we've talked about and i figured out
[7988.30 --> 7997.90]  but it is just to say that that's intuitive good design is just so utterly incorrect um
[7997.90 --> 8003.58]  um but i just i don't really we're clearly not living on the same planet speaking the same
[8003.58 --> 8009.18]  language so i don't even know how to talk to you like if you think that going into the apple mail app
[8010.38 --> 8018.06]  in order to sign into your google account system-wide is intuitive or good design it's it's just not it just
[8019.10 --> 8025.58]  isn't um and it's funny because i was reflecting on it some more and you know how the settings app is
[8025.58 --> 8030.54]  where it used to be before that if i recall correctly it actually used to be in the initial
[8030.54 --> 8037.42]  setup wizard am i am i remembering incorrectly because i i seem to recall that it used to be
[8037.42 --> 8041.66]  i think that was the case on android oh it's definitely the case on and it's still the case on android
[8041.66 --> 8048.94]  but i recall seeing that uh like like google microsoft that that interface right when you are
[8048.94 --> 8059.42]  setting up the phone initially um yeah no it was yeah it's it's it's amazing yeah people are saying
[8059.42 --> 8067.42]  yes yeah maldar the first says wait do they not just have an account section in settings no they do not
[8069.10 --> 8075.02]  it is not there and the people that are like well you're just used to android no apple used to have it
[8075.02 --> 8081.02]  you could be used to literally any other phone and that's where it should be yes yes they do not
[8081.02 --> 8087.18]  have it and yes that is on purpose you guys so so whenever people say to me yeah apple's just like
[8087.18 --> 8097.74]  it's more intuitive they're just wrong apple's design can be wrong and there's a lot of things they did
[8097.74 --> 8102.78]  really well intuitive is subjective though isn't it because it could be intuitive to a different person who
[8102.78 --> 8107.58]  has different expectations and different approaches but you can measure these things so one of the ways
[8107.58 --> 8114.30]  that i measured this one was i checked the number of ratings on the app store for the first party gmail
[8114.30 --> 8120.54]  app and the first party google calendar app because if you'll recall what i wanted to do was i wanted to
[8120.54 --> 8127.26]  use my gmail app and i wanted to use apple's calendar app because i wanted to try it i don't i don't actually
[8127.26 --> 8132.62]  have any attachment to apple's calendar app but i wanted to try it out but what i'm not interested in using is
[8132.62 --> 8138.70]  apple's mail app i don't like it i've never liked it um i prefer to just use the gmail app and what i
[8138.70 --> 8147.66]  found was that the the google gmail app had 2.2 million ratings on the app store the google calendar
[8147.66 --> 8155.50]  app had like a hundred thousand so what i can tell you objectively is that my setup where i wanted to roll
[8155.50 --> 8163.26]  the gmail app and apple's own calendar app is clearly a thing that people are doing 20 times the
[8163.26 --> 8169.90]  download rate of the gmail app versus the google calendar app so the number of people replacing
[8169.90 --> 8175.58]  their email client on the iphone compared to the number of people replacing their calendar client
[8175.58 --> 8180.46]  with google's first party alternatives or third party alternatives rather yeah but email is something
[8180.46 --> 8185.90]  that's like more important it's it's it's less replaceable than calendar because other people
[8185.90 --> 8193.26]  have your contact no no all i'm saying is is it wasn't intuitive for me necessarily and neither would
[8193.26 --> 8199.50]  it necessarily be for a lot of people to open up apple's mail app and use that because clearly lots of
[8199.50 --> 8207.66]  people don't use it they use the google one and clearly not all of those people also replaced the google
[8207.66 --> 8214.54]  calendar app they want to do exactly what i wanted to do use the gmail app and the apple calendar app
[8214.54 --> 8222.70]  right 20 times as many ratings so and you and you can't you can't do what you're saying oh you can
[8222.70 --> 8226.86]  but if you sign into the gmail app it doesn't sign you in system-wide
[8229.10 --> 8236.70]  in order to sign your google account in on an iphone you have to launch apple's mail app and sign into your
[8236.70 --> 8243.98]  gmail there okay there's nowhere else to do it what is the system what other things are handyman
[8243.98 --> 8250.22]  saying this isn't true um what what other things are you trying to have logged in i guess well i want
[8250.22 --> 8255.50]  my i want my contacts to sync you want your oh i want my calendar to sync okay i want my google account
[8255.50 --> 8265.90]  signed things like your your phone yeah you can do it in the settings no you can't here it is in my pocket
[8265.90 --> 8269.50]  there's a bunch of different people saying it right now i think this is going to be the biggest
[8269.50 --> 8273.66]  problem with the video you're almost going to have to have like an unlisted companion video
[8274.22 --> 8279.74]  that goes over like it's just like actually it really is this stupid here's here's the here's the
[8279.74 --> 8293.42]  defense minus cam settings here we go okay all right so here is yep there we go just making sure there's
[8293.42 --> 8303.58]  nothing particularly okay here we go here is settings accounts no third-party accounts just
[8303.58 --> 8312.94]  icloud just sign in with apple nothing else here's the rest of the settings settings apple account icloud
[8312.94 --> 8317.74]  mail that's the same thing isn't it there is but it's not you can't sign into gmail there
[8317.74 --> 8325.66]  settings apple account icloud mail but i don't use icloud settings apps calendar accounts settings
[8327.26 --> 8334.94]  hold on hold on hold on hold on settings apps apps where's that okay calendar
[8336.22 --> 8338.86]  uh right below calculator yeah
[8338.86 --> 8344.14]  are you kidding me there's a google button
[8350.22 --> 8356.14]  should we like go hold on a second hold on a second is your argument that that's intuitive
[8358.86 --> 8364.30]  to add an account to that app if you're an ios user and it's worked that way for 10 years like
[8364.30 --> 8370.06]  yeah but it didn't used to how did it used to i don't i never you i've never once mainlined an iphone
[8370.06 --> 8377.66]  there used to be in settings and accounts parent menu a handyman i don't think he's saying that
[8378.30 --> 8382.62]  you didn't show him two weeks ago he's saying that that doesn't seem intuitive i'm saying it's not
[8382.62 --> 8383.26]  intuitive
[8383.26 --> 8394.62]  so we will have to do can you not get there in the app or something or like no you can't that you
[8394.62 --> 8401.66]  definitely cannot so that feels unintuitive to me you can't do it in there you can get there in the mail
[8401.66 --> 8411.98]  app not in the calendar app but if i'm an ios user am i used to going to that settings page to do things
[8411.98 --> 8416.22]  like that so here's what happens here's what happens when you open mail and you aren't signed in
[8418.94 --> 8422.06]  you are prompted to sign in so that thing that we got on the other page yes
[8422.70 --> 8428.22]  here's what happens if you open up the first party calendar app and you are not signed in
[8430.54 --> 8434.94]  yeah because i'm assuming it just uses like a local account which again this is what i was kind of
[8434.94 --> 8439.26]  trying to point out earlier is like add calendar no nothing there
[8439.26 --> 8446.54]  add nope that's an event but but people are a little bit more uh
[8448.14 --> 8453.50]  is temporal the right word like like calendars are kind of whatever compared to an email account
[8453.50 --> 8458.62]  sure but so hold on but the part you're missing is i'm signing into my email
[8459.42 --> 8464.70]  but i'm using the gmail app i don't want to use apple's mail app yeah but like i'm not interested in
[8464.70 --> 8468.38]  i don't necessarily if i sign into my microsoft account on my phone i don't necessarily want to
[8468.38 --> 8473.10]  import my microsoft calendar into my calendars app no but you can be prompted what you do or don't want
[8473.10 --> 8479.02]  to sync when you add an account agree but does it work that way like what's is there a default calendar
[8479.02 --> 8486.62]  app on oh it would be the google calendar on android android android yeah i don't know that it asks you
[8486.62 --> 8493.42]  if you want your microsoft calendar stuff in here add another account can i add a non microsoft account
[8493.42 --> 8494.70]  this way checking info
[8498.78 --> 8504.46]  luke's doing stuff he's cooking it's a google it immediately assumes a google account um
[8505.34 --> 8511.10]  manage accounts on this device so that should that should bring you to where you can sign into any kind
[8511.10 --> 8516.38]  of account you want settings page but it does it's not actually it's not calendar specific
[8517.58 --> 8521.98]  it's just like everything no but you would go in your calendar app and you would tell it which calendars
[8521.98 --> 8530.22]  you want to sync i'm in my calendar app though and add another account is just google accounts
[8531.66 --> 8537.10]  and then i have manage accounts which just brings me to all general sorry what's the question though
[8537.10 --> 8542.22]  it's it there's no there's no prompt to add the microsoft account you're saying you're saying it
[8542.22 --> 8545.66]  would be more intuitive there's a prompt i'm saying i don't think there's a prompt on android
[8546.22 --> 8552.86]  if there's a prompt to add what though the microsoft account oh the microsoft account no no i would say
[8552.86 --> 8558.94]  a apple calendar thing but i don't have one of those so i can't no no i expected account management
[8558.94 --> 8568.06]  the place i expected to find account management was under my name here at the top sure oh whoops
[8568.06 --> 8575.02]  wow dang it i'm gonna figure this out camel name there we go the place i would expect to find it
[8575.02 --> 8580.06]  is under my name here at the top where my apple account and my icloud is i would i would expect to
[8580.06 --> 8586.14]  maybe find all of my accounts there uh i might expect it to find i might expect to find it under accounts
[8586.14 --> 8592.38]  like under you know general accessibility uh you know siri you know all my accounts here
[8592.38 --> 8598.94]  um those are places where i would expect to find system-wide accounts that i log into that
[8599.90 --> 8608.78]  work across multiple apps what i wouldn't expect is for the mail the the default mail and the default
[8608.78 --> 8615.82]  calendar app to operate completely different ways in terms of adding a new account so when i when i click on
[8615.82 --> 8623.26]  mail it immediately prompts me hey do you want to sign in to one of these types of accounts and we've
[8623.26 --> 8630.22]  got important thing important account types like aol for example in there uh when i go into the calendar
[8630.22 --> 8635.50]  one it prompts me for nothing so the only real point that i have with the calendar versus mail one is that
[8635.50 --> 8642.30]  they behave completely different ways yeah after i've already like gone into my my settings menu and what
[8642.30 --> 8647.98]  would be the most intuitive settings place for me different ways is the unintuitive portion after
[8647.98 --> 8652.86]  i've already gone into the settings and gone okay where the devil do i sign into my bloody google account
[8655.50 --> 8662.86]  yeah i'm just saying it it's not prompting you for any other accounts on on android either
[8662.86 --> 8665.66]  um
[8665.66 --> 8666.06]  um
[8666.06 --> 8672.06]  ry saw says it was much better in ios 17 they created the new apps menu at the bottom of settings in ios 18
[8672.46 --> 8677.58]  if i recall correctly the whole um finding finding settings
[8678.86 --> 8686.86]  under apps has been a thing for a really long time uh like i man i forget there was something years ago
[8686.86 --> 8694.54]  that i was trying to figure out how the heck to do and it turns out that it was like oh you know
[8694.54 --> 8698.14]  well was it that was it something was i trying to change something on the camera or something
[8698.70 --> 8703.82]  i forget what it was but i had to dig into apps in order to change something that that seemed like it
[8703.82 --> 8712.06]  would be sort of fundamental to the system i know sorry so the so the goofy like hiding settings in under
[8712.06 --> 8719.02]  apps thing um even though they are system wide and not necessarily specific to that particular app
[8719.02 --> 8724.94]  that's not new uh but i don't know to your point i haven't used ios 17 so i don't know i don't think
[8724.94 --> 8729.42]  they're having moved between i think you just think that they should be which is fine well if they
[8729.42 --> 8733.74]  affect more than one app yeah but that doesn't mean they're system-wide it means they affect that
[8733.74 --> 8739.34]  means they aren't that app that setting is are you saying one setting is changing things system-wide no
[8739.34 --> 8743.82]  i'm saying when you log into a google account yeah but i don't think you're logging into a system-wide
[8743.82 --> 8749.66]  account on iphone okay well sorry we're using the term system-wide very differently what i'm saying is
[8749.66 --> 8754.86]  that you are logged into an account that is inherently logged in the second you open up another supported
[8754.86 --> 8760.86]  app that uses that same login if i log into my mail account immediately my calendars will sync so it's
[8760.86 --> 8766.54]  my contacts will say indicated and all that okay okay okay so so that's that's what doesn't make sense to
[8766.54 --> 8774.94]  me why i have to open apple's mail account to do that or to your guys's point i have to go dig into
[8775.90 --> 8783.02]  apps find something that happens to be google will chrome work no chrome doesn't work i can't log into
[8783.02 --> 8793.10]  my google account in chrome brilliant um i'll have to find a different one docs docs doesn't work docs
[8793.10 --> 8803.10]  doesn't have the login drive maybe drive uh the login for what though for my google account i i'm not
[8803.10 --> 8810.86]  logged into it but like so but if i go to mail if i go to hold on and i don't know that that that that
[8810.86 --> 8817.82]  mail now i can log in my google account and it will work with those other things can you can you view
[8817.82 --> 8825.34]  outlook through the gmail app i don't use outlook so i don't know yeah like i don't know if maybe you
[8825.34 --> 8830.30]  can i don't know if you can add third-party apps to the the gmail account so i think the fact that
[8830.30 --> 8836.30]  there's is clunky what apparently you can really you can add outlook to the gmail account oh oh wait
[8836.30 --> 8841.18]  oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i don't have it set up that way yeah yeah no the gmail the gmail app is
[8841.18 --> 8846.38]  just a mail client multifunction mail yep yeah 100 because like what i'm looking at right now is yeah
[8846.38 --> 8852.06]  if and i don't want to show you guys sorry if i go add an account yes this will eventually load and
[8852.06 --> 8860.06]  it's it's only google accounts yeah so okay fine if i go manage accounts on this device yep it brings me
[8860.06 --> 8865.50]  to password pass keys and autofill and it doesn't bring up things that could sync that's not if i use
[8865.50 --> 8871.74]  that phone then i would say that that's trash and that's not intuitive yeah okay so my point is not
[8871.74 --> 8881.50]  that android is better yeah my point is that that is terrible and is not intuitive if i wanted to log
[8881.50 --> 8890.14]  in an account if i had never touched an android phone or an iphone before and i wanted to and i wanted to
[8890.14 --> 8895.50]  get get get my like google calendar and that was like the first thing that i wanted to do
[8897.90 --> 8903.42]  where do i go from here how would i how would i do it from here there is literally no way to be
[8903.42 --> 8909.66]  prompted to sign in to some other type of account literally no way i'm not gonna lie i'm immediately
[8909.66 --> 8916.06]  lost because i i feel so lost the second i touch an iphone that's not an iphone problem that's a that's
[8916.06 --> 8922.70]  a mini problem but um yeah i would personally like there to be a setting in the app somewhere i
[8922.70 --> 8928.22]  generally like it when i can fully operate things from within the app i don't like it when i have to go
[8928.22 --> 8935.98]  to external settings on on anything whether that's a desktop device um any form of phone whatever it
[8935.98 --> 8941.26]  doesn't matter so the you just fundamentally don't understand how this is working it's not a system
[8941.26 --> 8949.18]  wide account what you're saying is false i believe uh if i want my calendar to sync i have to sign in
[8949.18 --> 8963.10]  to the mail app really yes now i was shown that other way i can also go into settings right so i can
[8963.10 --> 8972.54]  also go into settings apps calendar and i can add a calendar account here
[8977.10 --> 8981.34]  so it's not going through the mail app but but it's still it's still a lot of clicks clunky that's
[8981.34 --> 8986.22]  what you're saying and it was a very different interface compared to when i went to the mail app
[8986.22 --> 8991.58]  and i was immediately prompted to sign into my gmail so if you open mail first the way that you're being
[8991.58 --> 8995.74]  trained to interact with the phone is not the same as when you open the calendar app correct yeah
[8997.26 --> 9002.14]  settings apps calendar accounts make sense to me though it does make sense to me too but his point
[9002.14 --> 9007.34]  is that when you open the mail app another first party app that is highly related to calendar i would
[9007.34 --> 9012.94]  say um it doesn't work the same way yeah so he just doesn't guess you didn't see that he clicked on
[9012.94 --> 9017.02]  the mail app he's not currently signed into anything so it immediately prompts him to log into stuff
[9017.02 --> 9021.42]  when he clicks on the calendar app there is no prompt now i have an icloud account because
[9021.42 --> 9026.54]  you have to sign into an icloud account in order to like sign into the phone in order to set up
[9026.54 --> 9031.10]  the phone as far as i know can you set it up without an apple account maybe you can i've never tried
[9031.66 --> 9037.58]  um so that's the calendars that it's pulling it's pulling like ancient apple calendars open
[9037.58 --> 9042.70]  open calendar i saw this button earlier but i didn't really think about it open calendar click on
[9042.70 --> 9051.42]  find it go away click on calendars at the bottom calendars at the bottom there we go and then i
[9051.42 --> 9059.34]  think i saw there's like uh add calendar yeah yep uh nope at holiday calendar at subscription
[9059.34 --> 9063.10]  calendar and family calendar what's just add calendar what's add calendar again
[9066.86 --> 9069.66]  so is it fixed on icloud can you click the thing that says icloud
[9069.66 --> 9074.46]  yeah i don't know guys
[9077.90 --> 9078.78]  i don't know what to tell you
[9083.34 --> 9088.46]  a calendar can be local to your vice only yeah i pointed that out earlier yeah um mail is not just
[9088.46 --> 9095.74]  local yeah yeah yeah um i don't know i i get why i understand what linus is saying i also get why it
[9095.74 --> 9102.22]  might not work that way um i would like that add a calendar thing that we just did it it literally
[9102.22 --> 9106.78]  shows an account line that's like it's it says account and then there's a grayed out text on the
[9106.78 --> 9114.06]  side that says icloud it was like if that just was able to be whatever you wanted then or it opened a
[9114.06 --> 9120.86]  prompt to log into another account yeah sure whatever yeah that's what i would try to do if i wanted to log
[9120.86 --> 9126.70]  into my calendar app i would go to my calendar app and this is exactly what i tried to do
[9127.26 --> 9132.70]  i went into my calendar app stop it i went into my calendar app i went to calendars i went to add
[9132.70 --> 9137.50]  calendar pretty intuitive i went to add calendar intuitive and i was like and now there's yeah
[9138.06 --> 9142.06]  which it feels broken almost there's there's a line that says account and then on the right
[9142.06 --> 9146.38]  it's grayed out and says icalender and he can't interact with it at all what's up with that that seems
[9146.38 --> 9154.30]  weird is something wrong no set up google in settings mail then turn on everything then in
[9154.30 --> 9158.94]  calendar tap on the word calendar at the bottom and add it there which is exactly what i've been trying
[9158.94 --> 9165.98]  to say so that makes it a global account if you do it that way well not global account but it it makes
[9165.98 --> 9173.98]  it so that you're like you can access your google crap will sink yeah see that's wacky i'm sorry but that is
[9173.98 --> 9183.82]  you're right i missed something it actually doesn't change my point at all that these two systems behave
[9183.82 --> 9187.42]  very such a bloodbath very differently from each other
[9190.78 --> 9197.66]  you should do like oh man it might be brutal it might suck yeah i think it'd be kind of fun if you did a
[9197.66 --> 9206.30]  stream like whatever the duration of the video is after the video launches yeah you start a live stream
[9207.58 --> 9211.42]  and then just basically do this that'd be kind of fun actually
[9214.14 --> 9220.78]  real time the um actually comments you're pissed about apple fight me live bruh like i don't know
[9220.78 --> 9225.10]  it'd be kind of interesting thank you mikao everyone's saying he's wrong is nitpicking the
[9225.10 --> 9230.14]  minutiae and missing the entire actual point missing the forest for the trees as it were you
[9230.14 --> 9235.98]  guys like what do you want me to say you guys are right that i didn't think to go digging into
[9236.78 --> 9242.38]  a sub menu of a sub menu of a sub menu instead of just opening the app and signing in the way that
[9242.38 --> 9249.66]  i did in the other one i would hope that's what that's the problem skill issue to sign into mail i just
[9249.66 --> 9257.34]  open the mail app and i sign into mail which will also allow me to sync my contacts and my calendars
[9257.34 --> 9262.70]  and and my google stuff that i need for work if i want to sign into calendar
[9264.46 --> 9272.86]  i open calendar and it's a complete dead end uh handyman saying because on iphone all settings
[9272.86 --> 9277.02]  are expected to be under settings apps that's just apple's approach may not like it but it's
[9277.02 --> 9281.98]  their way of doing it yeah there's lots of settings that are not what happens when they're not matter
[9281.98 --> 9286.54]  tim said does it matter that apple's guide on this explains it well and i found it quick
[9286.54 --> 9291.02]  i think good documentation matters and then he linked it i don't think you should need a guide for
[9291.02 --> 9296.62]  logging into your i think needing a guide inherently means it's not intuitive if we're using the word
[9296.62 --> 9303.66]  intuitive for what it's supposed to mean um yeah so the overly defensive line is here but
[9303.66 --> 9311.26]  um the intuitive using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning so
[9312.38 --> 9315.34]  needing to look up a guide just automatically yeah
[9321.18 --> 9327.26]  man anything to do with ios man is uh it's i don't know it's a spicy
[9327.26 --> 9337.74]  it's just a it's a really funny thing because i um i say look i uh i think hot dogs are unintuitive
[9338.46 --> 9346.86]  and people go hamburgers are so much less unintuitive linus linus loves hamburgers the ingredients slide
[9346.86 --> 9354.70]  around i think they're both unintuitive i think there's problems with both and i think to i think to i
[9354.70 --> 9362.94]  think to make this argument that this is that this is good design is just um like i don't really i don't
[9362.94 --> 9364.78]  really know what to tell you
[9367.42 --> 9373.26]  if i can and you say look it's the apple way that the settings for it are in the are in the apps part
[9373.26 --> 9380.62]  of the settings menu okay so is the account that you're logged into a setting yes or no
[9380.62 --> 9386.94]  i think i would generally think sure so then for the mail app it should be in the settings of the
[9386.94 --> 9394.22]  mail app it should not prompt me when i open it then it might even be useful in my opinion to make it
[9394.22 --> 9403.42]  so that uh i think some apps do work that way maybe not in the apple ecosystem but if it was like we see
[9403.42 --> 9409.10]  you're not signed in press this button to go to the settings and it like opens the settings app and
[9409.10 --> 9413.74]  like makes a little bit of a display of like sure but it doesn't do that yeah and that's the problem
[9413.74 --> 9418.30]  avon fox says it's not that it's that you say it's trash because it's not for how your brain works is
[9418.30 --> 9427.74]  insulting for people to people for whom it is um when something when when ui or ux is inconsistent
[9428.70 --> 9434.54]  that's bad that's measurably that's measurably bad that's not that's not the goal and
[9434.54 --> 9444.54]  because we're used to something does not mean that it's good and when i say something's bad it's not
[9444.54 --> 9450.38]  personal the fact that you're used to it or you like it it's not personal it's literally my job to
[9450.38 --> 9457.18]  point out things that are unintuitive or that aren't good about technology something that i will never
[9457.18 --> 9462.78]  understand though yeah is and this is again coming from android brain because it's the only thing i've used
[9462.78 --> 9471.74]  um my mom always struggled with android she would find ways to email me text messages uh wow like that's
[9471.74 --> 9476.86]  kind of impressive there's weird like no but she could not send me a normal text message i would just
[9476.86 --> 9483.18]  receive emails that were text messages and like i don't i've never actually even done that yeah like
[9483.18 --> 9489.42]  it's it's weird it's not a normal email it's not you know she sent an email with text in it no it's
[9489.42 --> 9495.74]  a text message in an email right like as an attachment yeah it's like it was very odd it was years ago but
[9495.74 --> 9502.14]  it was very weird and she had lots of other crazy weird problems with her android phone and then uh she
[9502.14 --> 9509.10]  was working in the movie industry for a while yeah and they had like standardized on some uh ios stuff i
[9509.10 --> 9513.98]  don't remember what it was yeah um so she needed an iphone she got an iphone instantly perfect
[9515.74 --> 9521.02]  i remember power user no issues i remember you telling me about this because to her the whole like
[9521.02 --> 9527.66]  like like like uh throwing away an app was just like super intuitive instant yeah no thoughts
[9528.46 --> 9532.30]  immediately worked like the most intuitive thing you could ever imagine yeah and then i try to go do
[9532.30 --> 9539.58]  something on her phone i'm like yeah i set up my aunt with an iphone years ago because basically i
[9539.58 --> 9545.26]  didn't want to coach her on how to use her phone yeah and it's been very painless it works so like i
[9546.38 --> 9553.50]  they got something going on um um so people are people are pointing out things that are just um
[9554.62 --> 9561.50]  like i i don't really oh man i don't really i don't really know what to say to you so zinthoxin
[9561.50 --> 9567.34]  says mail prompts you because it has nothing to load if you aren't signed in but okay please my
[9567.34 --> 9574.86]  problem was never that mail prompted me to sign in you liked that part of anything that's good yeah
[9575.50 --> 9583.26]  my problem was that when i did the same behavior the same user behavior and i opened my calendar
[9583.26 --> 9593.02]  it did not prompt me to log in and had absolutely no way for me to log in and no breadcrumb trail for
[9593.02 --> 9603.82]  me to follow to log in nothing if we agree that the account you're logged into is a setting and if we
[9603.82 --> 9612.14]  agree that apple puts settings under settings apps and the name of the app then we agree that the mail
[9612.70 --> 9620.46]  account that we log in should be there only there with no way to link to it from the app itself
[9621.42 --> 9629.42]  but that is not the case therefore the mail app follows a different set of rules from the calendar app
[9629.42 --> 9638.06]  guys are we there yet did we get there nidex or nidx i don't know yeah i think it's hubris to not
[9638.06 --> 9642.78]  ever look for help in the modern era and has good docs and he's talking about the fact that there's a
[9642.78 --> 9648.70]  good doc on how to do this one of the problems that you guys are some of you guys are really struggling
[9648.70 --> 9656.46]  with is the word intuitive if he has to look up a help doc for something it is not intuitive to him
[9656.46 --> 9661.82]  flat out there's no there's no other interpretation of that if he has to look up a help doc for
[9661.82 --> 9664.86]  something it is not intuitive also i did figure it out
[9667.18 --> 9670.78]  i figured out to log into the mail app that's not the problem
[9673.10 --> 9673.66]  oh boy
[9675.66 --> 9680.94]  cape says when will you have a video criticizing android these had many tons
[9680.94 --> 9690.70]  it's it's amazing for years for many years it's amazing the selective the selective perception
[9691.26 --> 9699.58]  that people have you're insulting my my tribe this entire video was dunking on the deplorable state
[9699.58 --> 9704.70]  of aosp yeah that might not have been the best video example to bring up it was two months ago
[9705.42 --> 9711.66]  i i i understand that not everyone agrees with the premise of the video yeah but the premise of the
[9711.66 --> 9716.38]  video was what the premise of the video was you guys aren't wrong that is stock android it is stock
[9716.38 --> 9719.98]  android whether you like it or not i just don't know how applicable it is because it doesn't apply to
[9719.98 --> 9724.70]  anybody but that was our point yeah our point was that stock android's kind of dead and we discussed
[9724.70 --> 9733.26]  some of the reasons that it's kind of dead for users yeah yes um uh let's see let's see uh
[9733.26 --> 9738.86]  i'm trying to remember because i'm pretty sure we did um
[9741.10 --> 9748.22]  i'm pretty sure we've done rant style videos on both ios and android or have we only done you know
[9748.22 --> 9755.02]  what no we haven't we did um i really wonder if you should somehow i don't know how you would do this
[9755.02 --> 9760.70]  is the video already shot uh partially i wonder if you should somehow get like a subset
[9760.70 --> 9767.02]  of you know those videos that are trending right now where these iphones are just better they put
[9767.02 --> 9772.22]  yeah six years ago there you go uh they have like somebody in a chair with a table and another chair
[9772.22 --> 9776.14]  across from it in the middle of a room and then a circle of people around it and it's like android is
[9776.14 --> 9780.54]  just better all those people in the circle versus one person yeah yeah that's already on the calendar
[9780.54 --> 9787.58]  oh okay i don't know so i i feel like you should like basically get a subset of like apple fans i can
[9787.58 --> 9793.50]  think of one t3 theo oh we could definitely find some and then give them your talking points for the
[9793.50 --> 9800.86]  video and then fight their talking points like in the video because i i've i've i don't know honestly
[9800.86 --> 9806.70]  that probably won't even help anything no it won't help it won't help anything luke i mean the fact that
[9806.70 --> 9813.66]  people don't think i criticize android is all that you really need to know about the sort of selection
[9813.66 --> 9826.70]  bias of um the perception of my takes on these things i have been hyper critical of windows android
[9826.70 --> 9833.66]  ios mac os basically like i said my entire job is looking at things and going this is what could be
[9833.66 --> 9842.78]  better about them i also highlight things i really like i just i'm just trying to take because i i
[9842.78 --> 9846.86]  know this obviously this video is going to be a bloodbath so i'm just trying to figure out like how
[9846.86 --> 9854.14]  do we how do we how do we pull all the iron out of it and make a sword um how do we like how do we do
[9854.14 --> 9859.58]  something cool with that basically so like there's the the stream that starts the the total duration of
[9859.58 --> 9867.34]  the video after the the video goes live um there's this like i don't know picking like five apple
[9867.34 --> 9873.58]  creators and then having them fight you on it or something um change my mind style i don't know
[9874.14 --> 9878.30]  i think that'd be kind of i think that'd be kind of fun yeah because especially like it could even be
[9878.30 --> 9883.42]  genuinely helpful because as long as people come in with like an understanding that you might end up
[9883.42 --> 9889.98]  agreeing to disagree then it's probably just going to be like a good conversation i don't know
[9892.22 --> 9896.62]  separate what is personal opinion in fact the whole conversation we're having right now is that
[9896.62 --> 9901.10]  that seems to be a very difficult thing like i i'm not going against evon fox here to be clear but that
[9901.10 --> 9905.66]  seems to be a very difficult thing with a lot of topics and this is one of them this is sure this
[9905.66 --> 9910.54]  is definitely one which is just baffling to me because so weird at the end of the day if you
[9910.54 --> 9916.94]  ripped my android phone out of my hands i'd use an iphone yeah like i um there would be things that
[9916.94 --> 9921.98]  bother me about it just like there are things that bother me about my android phone um tacky the penguin
[9921.98 --> 9926.22]  says you're really straining for a gnat which is not an expression i've heard before but i think i kind
[9926.22 --> 9931.18]  of like it you're straining for a gnat if your biggest issue with ios is how you sign into calendars
[9931.18 --> 9934.30]  it isn't it's just not intuitive
[9934.30 --> 9941.18]  who said it was and what i and what i said was anyone who tells me that is intuitive
[9941.90 --> 9947.90]  i'm sorry but i i i have to take exception and then i laid out why would you take the biggest
[9947.90 --> 9953.98]  exception with this issue i laid out the only exception you have in very clear like like the
[9953.98 --> 9963.10]  like in very clear mathematical terms why it's not intuitive and how the one app behaves differently
[9963.10 --> 9969.34]  from the other app and if we accept this rule that the account we're signed into is a setting
[9969.34 --> 9973.42]  and settings can only be here and are not linked to from the app then the fact that one behaves one
[9973.42 --> 9981.66]  way and one behaves the other way is not compatible with each other and that is not intuitive and pretty
[9981.66 --> 9989.66]  easy to solve as well actually extremely easy to solve yeah it is it is it is so easy to solve and
[9989.66 --> 9999.66]  is so intuitive to solve in fact some people who opposed my criticism of apple in the chat today
[9999.66 --> 10007.42]  we're saying it's so simple you just click add calendar but it wasn't there yeah why wasn't it there
[10008.06 --> 10014.22]  i don't know it seems like something's wrong because like why why would that line even be there if you
[10014.22 --> 10020.38]  can't do anything with it and that's where like my brain feels like it's broken and maybe this is
[10020.38 --> 10026.70]  android brain i don't know because i i i expected i would be able to click on that and it would list
[10026.70 --> 10031.58]  the various system-wide accounts that i have and there would be an account add account option and
[10031.58 --> 10035.18]  maybe it brings me out to some other menu and i have to add a system-wide account there's 10 trillion
[10035.18 --> 10039.90]  authentication steps and it puts its fingers into everything in my phone and whatever else but like
[10039.90 --> 10047.58]  that's the flow that i would expect i would not expect a a line that is completely not interactable
[10047.58 --> 10055.58]  on a page of inputs that's not something i would expect like ever to be honest apple was forced to
[10055.58 --> 10065.82]  make setting up mail as easy as apple mail great okay so you're saying then that the fact that they work
[10065.82 --> 10072.86]  differently is because apple put user hostile design that's not the argument you wanted in their
[10072.86 --> 10077.90]  calendar app and left it there because they were never forced to change it
[10084.38 --> 10084.78]  yikes
[10090.86 --> 10092.14]  why are they like this
[10095.82 --> 10098.54]  and now they want to change the subject
[10101.02 --> 10106.78]  well you got to go to settings and then there's the change subject app settings which are only in
[10106.78 --> 10111.74]  settings yeah but it's in the settings of the subject app not in the global settings
[10112.54 --> 10117.74]  and it's under a hamburger menu i got another merch message for you here we're gonna be here all night
[10117.74 --> 10125.50]  and luke's birds are gonna get sad why no sign do you want to move on we can keep talking about this
[10125.50 --> 10130.30]  if you want yeah no no no all right cool line us i need to paint my house it's only uh
[10130.30 --> 10137.02]  1 150 square feet people tell me rolling looks worse than spraying is it worth buying a sprayer just
[10137.02 --> 10143.66]  for one-time use absolutely rolling be okay get good at rolling uh it's not that hard um basically what
[10143.66 --> 10151.66]  it just comes down to is make sure you apply enough material and then kind of spread it out and level it
[10151.66 --> 10158.94]  out without um pressing too hard and then make sure that you've got a light on nearby because while
[10158.94 --> 10164.06]  it's wet it's really it kind of has a sheen and it's really easy to see any spots where you've got too
[10164.06 --> 10170.38]  much paint built up and it'll drip so make sure that you go right away um and and kind of level those
[10170.38 --> 10176.70]  out without a ton of paint on the roller before moving on to the next area um cut in the edges
[10176.70 --> 10181.10]  first even though it's like tedious and it feels like you're not making any progress even though
[10181.10 --> 10185.82]  you're doing the vast majority of the work you're covering the minority of the wall and then uh
[10187.10 --> 10191.26]  and then do your uh and then do your rolling it makes the yeah the remaining a lot easier yeah
[10191.90 --> 10197.74]  use a drop sheet no matter how careful you think you can be use a drop sheet because as you roll the
[10197.74 --> 10203.42]  roller it turns obviously and when you've got paint on it'll flick out little bits of paint
[10203.42 --> 10207.66]  so as long as you have a drop sheet down there it'll grab everything why would you say using a
[10207.66 --> 10216.30]  spray is unintuitive i i'll not yeah sure i'll tell you paint sprayer operation is often not very
[10216.30 --> 10224.06]  intuitive sure i'm just no i'm good i i will i will die on that hill the apple one honestly doesn't
[10224.06 --> 10229.34]  matter to me that much but i will die on the paint sprayer hill del main was like i just tagged me
[10229.34 --> 10242.78]  and said i hate you fair enough oh man okay uh this is a hard end of the show been seeing the hoodie
[10242.78 --> 10247.50]  all week on tech and game linked and couldn't wait for it to drop the wife and i are suckers for cozy
[10247.50 --> 10255.42]  clothing linus what's the next step in foldables that makes it mainstream hi man i don't know for
[10255.42 --> 10261.90]  apple to make one and i don't think they will uh it's been rumored for a long time they're clearly
[10261.90 --> 10268.22]  looking at the technology they'd be crazy not to be looking at it at the very least but they obviously
[10268.22 --> 10274.38]  have a lot of work to do on making their sign-in process consistent from app to app so they still
[10274.38 --> 10278.78]  haven't figured out how to make the camera bump they do only have one developer so we got to give
[10278.78 --> 10283.82]  them time let them cook yeah currently they're working on the calendar login um we'll have to
[10283.82 --> 10289.42]  come back to foldable compatibility yeah they got they got t9 dialing nailed though nice yeah good job
[10290.22 --> 10296.86]  yeah they did it deserves a promotion then they'll have zero devs i actually i actually love it i love
[10296.86 --> 10305.02]  t9 dialing it's so great the um the way that apple handles all your different um phone call
[10305.82 --> 10312.54]  accounts so to speak your different voice uh communication methods is amazing here call me
[10312.54 --> 10319.26]  call me on the phone sorry i'm just very tempted to dofo said a good one which was uh
[10319.26 --> 10322.86]  uh why are you saying that flat screens are so unintuitive
[10327.34 --> 10329.34]  okay i'm calling okay okay
[10333.42 --> 10339.98]  okay so check this out uh yeah there's no okay so it comes up like this right and then if i want
[10339.98 --> 10343.10]  to answer then i just you know hit my button or whatever okay call me on teams now
[10343.10 --> 10347.34]  be here for a half hour no no it's cool
[10351.90 --> 10362.06]  i hate teams so much you really do okay so this is cool watch this how cool is that the interface is
[10362.06 --> 10367.74]  really nice identical that's genuinely very nice and the best part is if i go into my call log
[10367.74 --> 10378.46]  just both that's really nice yeah that's intuitive that's very intuitive objectively that's intuitive
[10378.46 --> 10384.22]  genuinely very cool i actually yeah i am envious of that it's especially nice on like for carplay
[10384.86 --> 10391.10]  because i don't have to think about what slightly different interface might come up like when i get
[10391.10 --> 10397.50]  a whatsapp call in the car on android it sucks it like brings up a little thing swipey things and
[10397.50 --> 10403.90]  whatever yeah it's annoying yeah so it's very very intuitive okay so apple people are you okay now
[10404.78 --> 10409.98]  are you good that is genuinely like as someone who doesn't use iphones that is sick and i wish i had that
[10409.98 --> 10415.82]  are you good are you okay are we are we over the calendar thing probably not and how the settings are
[10415.82 --> 10421.02]  not in the same place and that's objectively actually kind of stupid but but this isn't this is not
[10421.02 --> 10426.14]  stupid this is really good something they are they are in this they're something that's not no they're
[10426.14 --> 10430.22]  not in the same place they are but they're also sometimes in a different place but not
[10430.86 --> 10435.50]  they're one time in a different place yeah yeah yeah which is except when they aren't in that
[10435.50 --> 10441.74]  different place yeah which is not intuitive yeah but this you know what makes something intuitive
[10441.74 --> 10448.78]  when someone who's never seen it before is like whoa that's really intuitive yeah that was pretty
[10448.78 --> 10455.90]  intuitive wasn't it yeah and oh man not having to like bananas sometimes swipe left and sometimes
[10455.90 --> 10462.78]  swipe out of a circle and sometimes press a circle on android the call receiving like button it's just
[10462.78 --> 10470.78]  different depending on how someone's calling you it's incredibly stupid we concede the calendar
[10470.78 --> 10482.62]  for the acknowledgement of call history the apple nation has accepted the diplomatic oh oh man so yeah
[10482.62 --> 10489.42]  i there's lots of things that i actually love about it that are objectively better dude the dedicated um
[10490.54 --> 10496.30]  the dedicated voice input button at the bottom of the screen that's just always right there whenever
[10496.30 --> 10500.62]  you have your keyboard up and you don't have to long press and it does punctuation automatically
[10500.62 --> 10507.26]  which is super cool there's there's tons of stuff that's really good i've got a i've got one my swift
[10507.26 --> 10513.66]  key one so i use a third party keyboard right ah i've been using the same third party keyboard for so long i
[10513.66 --> 10519.26]  don't remember what normal one is so i use a third party keyboard and mine puts it way across the screen
[10519.82 --> 10524.30]  but with apple regardless of whether you're using a first party keyboard or a third party keyboard
[10524.30 --> 10528.78]  there's a voice input button that is independent of that and that sits under it sure which
[10530.06 --> 10531.74]  is really intuitive sure
[10534.22 --> 10538.22]  there you go we good you got a bonus one two things now yeah you got a bonus oh
[10539.18 --> 10544.86]  the android nation something is there a next topic no there's no other topic this is it leave
[10546.54 --> 10551.58]  uh okay sorry that it's not intuitive that there isn't carson asks uh in your experience does
[10551.58 --> 10561.02]  icloud no no no i'm just kidding they want balance floatplane chat wants balance they want a negative
[10561.02 --> 10563.42]  thing i'm going home
[10563.42 --> 10574.86]  i want to try one honestly i've never done it an iphone yeah i tried an ipad and then
[10574.86 --> 10578.38]  immediately threw it out it's gonna say i feel like you'd go insane i would probably
[10578.38 --> 10581.42]  what's wrong with the ipad no we're not talking about this i love the ipad
[10581.42 --> 10585.90]  i love the ipad shut up linus dude have you ever used an android tablet i was going to say it is the
[10585.90 --> 10590.06]  superior tablet only with extreme custom firmware it's not even close
[10591.98 --> 10597.90]  linus as someone who practices 321 backups are mdiscs or blu-rays viable i bought some recently
[10597.90 --> 10603.18]  to backup archive some important stuff but now i'm wondering if my efforts are better spent elsewhere
[10603.90 --> 10609.18]  um very viable no mdisc is totally a different class of storage device and tape are you familiar with
[10609.18 --> 10616.94]  them uh yeah but is he like actively using them uh well you don't they're just like an archival grade
[10616.94 --> 10623.50]  dvd essentially yeah yeah so if you have like uh like legal documents or something like that i would
[10623.50 --> 10630.46]  say out of tape mdisc blu-ray throw them on mdiscs that's that's the way to go for something that you
[10630.46 --> 10637.42]  really want to not rot um i would trust that more than a hard drive in storage that's actually been a
[10637.42 --> 10643.42]  big problem for um data recovery companies is some of those drives are getting so old that even if
[10643.42 --> 10649.26]  they're brand new and sitting in storage they're just like they don't last forever whereas mdiscs i
[10649.26 --> 10652.54]  think are rated for like a thousand years or something like that i really i don't know that
[10652.54 --> 10656.38]  they'd actually last that long but they're rated for an extremely long time what is tape rated for
[10657.18 --> 10661.50]  um well it's more that it's more physically fragile a disc has no moving parts
[10661.50 --> 10669.90]  all right so i i would be personally a little more comfortable with with mdisc um it's also like
[10669.90 --> 10675.34]  you can just get like a fireproof file cabinet and just you could store a functionally unlimited number
[10675.34 --> 10682.30]  of m discs in that compared to like tapes yeah um and and the tapes would store more especially like
[10682.30 --> 10688.70]  more modern um more modern tape formats but if you're doing legal documents yeah then it's it's purely
[10688.70 --> 10694.62]  archival tiny files yeah and yeah they're small files anyway and if you're going back to and and
[10694.62 --> 10699.42]  having having like like smaller amounts and just like a ton of them and putting labels on them versus
[10699.42 --> 10704.30]  like how much how much stuff do you have to back up to this one tape before you finally put it in the
[10704.30 --> 10710.30]  archive i'd almost be afraid to like have a pending have enough data pending that i'm going to fill
[10710.30 --> 10714.06]  up a tape before i can put it away do you kind of get what i mean don't you need special software for
[10714.06 --> 10718.94]  tape as well that remembers where all the data is on the tape itself you need uh and oh and you need
[10718.94 --> 10724.94]  an expensive uh reader and writer whereas mdisc can be written on not quite commodity but slightly more
[10724.94 --> 10733.42]  expensive burners i didn't realize actually i yeah i didn't realize quite how not as long tape lasted as
[10733.42 --> 10737.02]  i thought yeah no mdisc sick had a longer i don't use it though
[10743.42 --> 10748.54]  cool i don't know just put it in an s3 bucket and let it be amazon's problem to delete all your data
[10748.54 --> 10754.30]  is it is it is it is it not intuitive it's not very intuitive i just put everything on icloud i mean
[10754.30 --> 10761.50]  if it lasts a long time they should call it ldisc yeah but then they might think it's like linus disc
[10762.14 --> 10771.34]  yeah might not be very intuitive no okay i'm a small vintage tech youtuber with 1000 subs
[10771.34 --> 10774.06]  and you guys are a big influence they could call it long disc
[10774.06 --> 10784.30]  yeah i mean that might be a little unintuitive though because if the association is also linus then
[10784.30 --> 10790.62]  people could get a false impression i mean you don't know well i guess i kind of know
[10792.38 --> 10796.06]  all right then avon fox what about average second disc a disc
[10796.06 --> 10797.02]  a disc a disc
[10800.86 --> 10801.58]  it's okay disc
[10803.90 --> 10805.50]  moderately acceptable disc
[10815.18 --> 10823.42]  okay all right hi yes dan sorry hi i'm a small vintage youtuber uh with about a thousand subs
[10823.42 --> 10827.82]  and you guys are a big influence to me would you ever take a small creator and have your team
[10827.82 --> 10831.26]  punch up a vid to see how much pro editing can drive views
[10833.74 --> 10840.70]  hmm interesting uh it's more than just editing i mean it's writing hosting editing topic selection
[10840.70 --> 10846.06]  thumbnail ludwig did a really interesting pieces experiment a while ago actually where
[10846.06 --> 10853.50]  um he tried to see how successful he could be as a new youtuber using none of his
[10855.18 --> 10860.22]  contacts not using his own likeness his own face or anything like that uh basically trying to pick a
[10860.22 --> 10865.98]  topic using i think it was like someone else's voice and doing a like image slash video with a voice
[10866.62 --> 10871.58]  uh with voiceover thing i don't know i don't know how i would find this uh ludwig
[10871.58 --> 10881.42]  is it someone already find the link holy crikey dude yeah that was fast thanks nerdy or nerdle okay
[10881.82 --> 10888.46]  um ludwig i made a secret youtube channel to prove it's not luck this was wildly successful um
[10889.34 --> 10897.18]  this video is genuinely super interesting he talks about uh topic selection um he talked about how
[10897.18 --> 10903.74]  how he was able to promote it so like he wrote this video the title is really good how a door made
[10903.74 --> 10909.66]  this man a million dollars like i would click on that i want to click it now yeah it's about something
[10909.66 --> 10914.94]  that he knows so it's about another streamer named miz kiff i don't think he actually used like
[10914.94 --> 10919.50]  technically insider knowledge that someone else couldn't know i don't remember it's i watched this
[10919.50 --> 10926.22]  a long time ago so he kind of artificially through his own prior knowledge created a very meticulously
[10926.22 --> 10931.34]  researched video that someone else could have made yeah i think that was it i'm pretty sure
[10931.34 --> 10935.58]  um and then he he shows about like promoting it stuff too so creating the channel he goes through
[10935.58 --> 10941.26]  all those details yeah making a thumbnail blah blah blah blah blah um and then at some point in time
[10941.26 --> 10948.54]  i don't remember where it is yeah he he like promotes it because he chose making a video about a streamer
[10948.54 --> 10955.90]  who does reaction videos so that he could link it in their stream and they would likely watch it
[10955.90 --> 10961.26]  because you like if you if we if we if someone linked us a video like hey someone made a video i don't
[10961.26 --> 10965.98]  know it's it's likely i don't think it's likely not for us not for us but a lot of other people
[10965.98 --> 10973.10]  we're not that edgy and especially not right now um but a lot of streamers would so he links it to them
[10973.10 --> 10978.70]  and then they actually do watch it on stream at some point um that gets it a bunch of traction
[10978.70 --> 10983.34]  people liked the video he tells them to go subscribe whatever and it starts the channel off and it's
[10983.34 --> 10989.26]  it's like it's really interesting because he genuinely goes through all the steps um yeah this is this is
[10989.26 --> 10996.54]  like ms kiff watching the video i guess yeah that's him watching it i don't remember if they actually
[10996.54 --> 11005.90]  show the like metrics of the channel what's the fair use situation of ludwig using ms kiff's reaction
[11005.90 --> 11011.66]  video of ludwig's video that he made is it is it intuitive
[11015.26 --> 11021.02]  um yeah i don't i don't remember like how well it did but i mean first time video and we're talking
[11021.02 --> 11030.46]  about views from different areas in the thousands like that's pretty cool yeah that's very cool so
[11030.46 --> 11036.22]  i don't know you can do it i don't necessarily think it's like just particularly having good editing
[11036.22 --> 11042.30]  or just having particularly good something else you need to bring everything together um for it to be
[11042.30 --> 11048.62]  intuitive yeah i mean i think that i think it would i think it could be i think it could be
[11048.62 --> 11055.66]  an interesting experiment but it would have to be we'd have to be all in like you'd basically we
[11055.66 --> 11062.62]  basically have to like like bring a production crew to you you'd have to kind of tell us okay here's
[11062.62 --> 11071.18]  five concepts that i have um we'd kind of have to massage them and go okay this is your best one this is
[11071.18 --> 11077.74]  probably your strongest angle for it oh one and a half million views okay yeah i mean it's riding on the
[11077.74 --> 11083.34]  back of this video which has 6.5 million views that's hard to evaluate now yeah um so we'd have
[11083.34 --> 11088.86]  to come all the way out there we'd probably have to kind of use our process right you'd tell us kind
[11088.86 --> 11095.66]  of everything you know and then i would lay out all the like the intro the story beats the conclusion
[11095.66 --> 11101.18]  we'd figure out how to package it can we make a youtuber you would yeah you would sit there and you
[11101.18 --> 11106.62]  would read the you would read the the script but i don't know if uh if you're on floatplane you might
[11106.62 --> 11112.22]  have seen this before um but there's a there's a behind the scenes of me working with uh ryan
[11112.22 --> 11117.98]  shroud and tom peterson who both at the time read intel i think shroud's moved on i think tap's still there
[11117.98 --> 11125.34]  um but basically there's a behind the scenes of me coaching them on their part in our video on intel arc
[11125.34 --> 11132.94]  uh where effectively i just say okay repeat exactly after me
[11135.26 --> 11140.94]  and what's really special about this product is and what's really special about this product is
[11140.94 --> 11148.06]  so essentially like like like showing them the exact intonation that they need in order to make the
[11148.06 --> 11153.58]  delivery a little bit more dynamic and engaging so i would probably have to do that unless you're
[11153.58 --> 11158.06]  amazing at it already which you might be i'm not you didn't even say exactly what your channel was
[11158.06 --> 11163.10]  so i'm not sure what it is and then from there we would have to kind of show you okay well what does
[11163.10 --> 11167.18]  it look like to put together all the guidance for the visuals that are going to support this then we'd edit it
[11168.54 --> 11175.02]  then we'd edit it um and at that point i don't know it's tough like um
[11177.34 --> 11183.42]  we haven't really answered your question like how much pro editing drives it because there's so much
[11183.42 --> 11191.42]  more to the editing process than just the edit so i don't know what to tell you yeah
[11192.94 --> 11198.46]  linus what advice would you give a young canadian business owner i'm from ontario run
[11198.46 --> 11207.50]  to ltt store and get these good deals um man
[11214.38 --> 11224.78]  it's been a long week uh be prepared the whole world scar let alone let alone canada is in um
[11224.78 --> 11232.86]  um has been you know in not great economics yeah space for a while now um this isn't a new thing
[11232.86 --> 11240.06]  everyone talks about the impact on consumers of inflation because most people are consumers rather
[11240.06 --> 11246.94]  than business owners but businesses are absolutely impacted by it as well yeah and and and on both ends
[11246.94 --> 11252.86]  right because on the one side you've got your suppliers or your partners demanding more because of
[11252.86 --> 11263.66]  the impact of inflation on them so in a way you're kind of caught in a squeeze if you increase the price
[11263.66 --> 11268.06]  of your product some people might not be able to afford it anymore despite everything else because
[11268.06 --> 11272.54]  they might not be getting raises from their companies to keep up even if you're giving your people
[11273.18 --> 11278.22]  um raises so you're you're you might have less less um revenue and
[11278.22 --> 11283.74]  you're getting rid of it again has ifa asks uh linus and luke trudeau or pierre yes
[11285.74 --> 11288.14]  no we have a de facto two-party system luke
[11290.38 --> 11298.14]  no i know but yes wasn't it so cool when he was like i'm gonna get rid of first first post he was
[11298.14 --> 11305.18]  like it's done dude getting rid of it bro it's obviously really stupid and you all voted me in for
[11305.18 --> 11311.66]  this reason so i'm definitely gonna do it i am and then i didn't i know that there's been plenty of
[11311.66 --> 11319.10]  other things hell yeah that captain jt has um has screwed up demotem but the one that i am actually
[11319.10 --> 11327.26]  by far by far the most angry about is first past the post yeah it enrages me as well like election
[11327.26 --> 11335.18]  reform is something that um you know i would think that canadians and americans uh the need for
[11335.18 --> 11339.34]  election reform i would think is something that canadians and americans should probably
[11340.70 --> 11347.66]  all be pretty aligned on at the citizen level um and the fact that they that he promised he was
[11347.66 --> 11351.26]  gonna get that done and then was like psych
[11354.30 --> 11363.18]  not cool jt not cool bruh not cool bruh there's like a way there was a our own province for the
[11363.18 --> 11370.70]  americans that's the same thing as a state yeah well it's not yeah that's fair yeah uh anyways it's like
[11370.70 --> 11377.02]  a state except it's like it's actually part of canada instead of like wanting to be its own thing
[11377.02 --> 11383.58]  completely yeah yeah but except for alberta and quebec they also want to be their own thing
[11387.10 --> 11392.94]  except for a lot of them anyways i'm not sure how stoked the prairies are on the whole like
[11392.94 --> 11398.86]  commonwealth either but you know whatever yeah bc kind of hides on the other side of the rockies and
[11398.86 --> 11405.18]  pretends we're part of washington yeah yeah we are us us washington state and oregon state as far as i
[11405.18 --> 11412.14]  can tell like like if the whole rest of the world went to crap i think i we could probably get uconn in
[11412.14 --> 11416.14]  there like i i think if the whole rest of the world went to crap we could all probably kind of come
[11416.14 --> 11423.50]  together and be like pacific northwest land rain land yeah yeah we like it wet um
[11425.42 --> 11429.82]  uh i was gonna say yeah we had a we had a provincial election here recently and i
[11429.82 --> 11436.06]  i i was looking into it because i was like i want to be an informed voter and i i found the like
[11436.06 --> 11440.70]  the platforms page for the three parties he sends this to me in the middle of the night he's like oh
[11440.70 --> 11451.82]  my god i was like what are you talking about the the like it really felt like genuinely someone in grade four
[11451.82 --> 11459.74]  was like um this would be uh i don't know they're like ask chat gpt like how should i make a bad
[11459.74 --> 11463.42]  political campaign and they were like i don't know do this and then they actually published it
[11463.42 --> 11468.86]  like it's stunning that people put this on paper and i mean that for both of the main two parties
[11468.86 --> 11476.62]  think about it when you were in grade 11 grade 12 okay and you like put together a project on something
[11477.34 --> 11482.22]  and you like did some research or whatever and you did a presentation at the front of the class it
[11482.22 --> 11491.18]  seems like it went further than those that as far as i can tell a lot of people never really progress
[11491.18 --> 11498.38]  past that in terms of like their research and presentation and data compilation skills and and
[11498.38 --> 11503.50]  and you you would think you would think but of all i mean you know these are people in like a position of
[11503.50 --> 11509.26]  you know where it's really important for them to be able to do that's been a wild realization like
[11509.26 --> 11515.74]  like as an adult and it's it still gets me it still gets me often where i'm like oh like this person's
[11515.74 --> 11521.66]  coming from from i don't know this this company or this this area of expertise or whatever educational
[11521.66 --> 11525.66]  background and you you start conversing with them and you're like oh okay like this is gonna be great
[11525.66 --> 11530.30]  i'm gonna like i'm gonna learn so much it's gonna be so so useful or interesting or whatever the
[11530.30 --> 11535.10]  scenario that you're in is and then you start actually working with them and you're like oh
[11538.22 --> 11544.38]  okay you're just like a dude well everyone's just a dude yeah like that's the thing right
[11545.02 --> 11550.46]  all right like we i don't know it's funny we we leave you know school where we look around at all
[11550.46 --> 11555.58]  our peers and we're like everyone's just a dude and then we go into the real world and we're like oh
[11555.58 --> 11562.62]  you're a librarian and you're a dentist and you're a bus driver and you're this and you're that and
[11562.62 --> 11567.58]  it's like no no no no you're all just dudes i think that you're doing those things i think the hope is
[11567.58 --> 11571.82]  that when you're in high school you're you're like progressing so much year to year that when you leave
[11571.82 --> 11575.98]  high school i think i think there's probably still some amount of assumption that like you're really
[11575.98 --> 11581.26]  going to be progressing a lot so like if someone worked in a field for 20 years you're going to expect
[11581.26 --> 11586.78]  like this unobtainium feeling level of of expertise i don't know that does exist
[11588.62 --> 11594.54]  sometimes it does oh it totally does for sure luke i don't know what was more enlightening for me
[11595.42 --> 11605.10]  when i had children and realized that kids are just tiny adults yep or yeah sorry i keep
[11605.10 --> 11614.06]  or when the inverse dawned on me yeah yeah yeah yeah just a bunch of really big kids walking around
[11615.98 --> 11625.10]  and to be clear to be clear present party included i am not some kind of paragon of maturity let's be
[11625.10 --> 11632.54]  real here oh yeah dude i still i still feel like i have honestly a lot of the state the same wants and
[11632.54 --> 11642.62]  desires and i said inverse not converse that i did when i was 15 14 honestly like you know the approach
[11642.62 --> 11646.70]  might be different did we crystallize like way younger than i think people are comfortable
[11646.70 --> 11653.82]  thinking about yeah like going to my 20 year high school of reunion i'm like yeah did you go yeah
[11653.82 --> 11661.98]  why not i haven't gone to anyone i don't know hot take don't be too cool to go to a reunion it's not
[11661.98 --> 11668.54]  even that i just yeah no what no it totally is i've yeah most of the people that i've talked to about it
[11668.54 --> 11674.54]  it basically boiled down to like i'm too cool to care about this no i i'm still in contact with
[11674.54 --> 11680.22]  honestly a lot of people from my high school sure so like i don't know we'll like go have a campfire
[11680.22 --> 11685.98]  with like 20 of them this is my reunion but that's not the reunion yeah that's not the point of it i'm
[11685.98 --> 11691.26]  not saying i'm too cool for the other one i just don't care but it's not because i'm too cool i
[11691.82 --> 11693.18]  objectively don't think i'm cool
[11697.18 --> 11702.38]  i just i'll let you guys unpack all of that i'm not gonna go yeah yeah i'm not interested yeah
[11702.38 --> 11710.14]  charged nuclei says it's because everyone else is less cool deep blue v says sure luke sure no i
[11710.14 --> 11716.30]  just says which makes you cool i think if you're not in contact with a bunch of people from your
[11716.30 --> 11721.10]  high school it could be good also in the age of facebook i think that's another big change
[11721.82 --> 11724.94]  because there there are people from my high school that i'm not actively in contact with
[11724.94 --> 11729.74]  that every once in a blue moon i'm like i wonder what they're up to and then i go click oh and then
[11729.74 --> 11736.14]  then i'm done i didn't need more than that i don't know look i i only stayed for about 15 minutes
[11737.50 --> 11743.34]  well because uh it was one of my kids birthday party that day okay and so i was like well i i'd like
[11743.34 --> 11750.22]  to go i'll go show my face say hi and you know see what see if there's anyone that i recognize um
[11750.94 --> 11757.66]  some of them i didn't i i like i had a pretty big class and i was a loser so like i was actually not
[11757.66 --> 11763.42]  cool you had a pretty big class you didn't go to like a i thought you went to like a farm school
[11763.42 --> 11768.70]  basically well yeah well were you commuting well i had to drive a fair bit to get there it was like
[11768.70 --> 11773.58]  20 minute drive how big was your great your your my uh well when i say pretty big class i mean for
[11773.58 --> 11778.86]  me to remember all the names and faces like our yeah our school was about i want to say about 1500
[11778.86 --> 11783.18]  or something like that so my class was a few hundred people i think yeah i think you're at a bigger
[11783.18 --> 11789.42]  school but part of the problem for me is that um i was in the like i was i was kind of in my like
[11789.42 --> 11797.90]  streamlined pod um so i was taking like challenge courses and ap courses so i saw a lot of the same
[11797.90 --> 11804.14]  like 25 people and i saw very little of the rest of the 90 of the class oh interesting i saw i saw a
[11804.14 --> 11810.62]  lot of those folks and like i took metal art and jewelry um we had a really small shop believe it or not
[11810.62 --> 11817.10]  so we like we only had one ap course if i remember correctly it was ap english oh yeah okay
[11818.06 --> 11824.14]  like there wasn't like so you you were often like i was quite mixed amongst everybody we only for ap i
[11824.14 --> 11833.34]  think we only had english as well so challenge was just our internal like uh name for like a slightly
[11833.34 --> 11837.82]  more challenging version of what is essentially the same curriculum i've never even heard of whereas ap is
[11837.82 --> 11843.02]  its own like separate entity that like organizes things oh dan is saying we're over time oh we're
[11843.02 --> 11851.50]  over time yeah um you okay luke uh i am still good but not for like a long time okay cool yeah i just
[11851.50 --> 11858.62]  needed to check in yeah no that's good let me just wrap up pretty soon here yeah yeah i don't know i'm not
[11858.62 --> 11866.22]  like against it i just i just don't care it's got facebook spoken like a true cool guy sounds like a very cool
[11866.22 --> 11872.30]  answer i met somebody oh my goodness oh my you know somebody you know it's like whatever man like
[11873.10 --> 11876.70]  yeah we're all just kind of going through life i'm just not that into it i could go to the high
[11876.70 --> 11881.74]  school reunion i could do it but like i don't know or i could do something way more important and sexy
[11883.34 --> 11889.42]  could hang out with my beautiful partner and my birds and my cool uh birds are pretty cool okay cool
[11889.42 --> 11896.46]  friend i i met somebody at the gym that uh i went i could lift something heavy to elementary and middle
[11896.46 --> 11900.38]  school with and that was cool but they don't do like elementary and middle school reunions
[11901.10 --> 11905.18]  like those people i actually don't have contact with anymore any of them so you would go that was
[11905.18 --> 11910.06]  pretty face you would go to a grade seven reunion yeah actually interesting because i don't remember
[11910.06 --> 11913.98]  almost any of their names i don't have any contact with them anymore because that was pre-facebook and
[11913.98 --> 11918.86]  stuff you know what's funny is i actually had the exact same thought like two weekends ago i was back
[11918.86 --> 11926.14]  in ladner and i was at sharky's bar and grill with my my grandparents the kids great-grandparents and
[11926.14 --> 11933.42]  the more i think of it this is more true and the the waitress bore a striking resemblance to someone that
[11933.42 --> 11938.46]  i went to school with the age wasn't right like they were younger yeah but i was like holy crap i
[11938.46 --> 11945.18]  wonder if they're a relative of of this girl i went to school with um i i didn't want to ask because
[11945.18 --> 11949.50]  people don't interact in person anymore yeah and it'd be like a weird thing to ask someone speaking
[11949.50 --> 11955.90]  is weird hey do you have a relative do you have a relative named whatever like you look like someone
[11955.90 --> 11962.46]  i know it almost seems like a pickup line you know oh yeah really i don't well you never know people
[11962.46 --> 11966.94]  people apparently just like don't approach each other in person anymore so so anything sounds like a
[11966.94 --> 11971.18]  pickup line i i would think so fair enough and i was just like it was unnecessary i don't actually
[11971.18 --> 11977.82]  care that much so i i wasn't gonna like say anything weird uh aragoth says yeah that's a fair concern in
[11977.82 --> 11983.10]  my opinion make as advised says i accidentally picked up a girl that way okay so there you go i'm
[11983.10 --> 11989.18]  apparently not completely crazy i do think it would have been fine i was there with my wife and my kids
[11989.18 --> 11994.62]  and my grandparents like yeah that kind of diffuses a lot of that clearly i'm not making a move but never
[11994.62 --> 12001.74]  underestimate how scummy a dude could be so and modern relationships sometimes exactly who knows
[12001.74 --> 12011.02]  exactly who knows who those kids are actually born from yeah yep um what about second wife it says
[12011.02 --> 12016.78]  mine still anyway uh the point is it it made me think about someone that i hadn't thought about in
[12016.78 --> 12023.02]  yeah a bazillion years and i was like dude how cool would that be because this came on the heels of my
[12023.02 --> 12029.18]  aunt telling me because she ran into the mom of like my elementary school bff who was like oh yeah he's
[12029.18 --> 12034.86]  like moving to north vancouver and like has a kid and stuff and i was like it's crazy to think about
[12034.86 --> 12043.10]  what you know yeah um yeah like i i don't know i i think that'd be cool like i left i left my elementary
[12043.10 --> 12053.34]  school my first elementary school after grade two so like being able to be like hey remember me no i
[12053.34 --> 12058.22]  have i why i i uh i'm pretty cool
[12064.78 --> 12070.70]  i don't even want to like tell this story i mean i think you're committed now so let's go cool guy i think
[12070.70 --> 12078.70]  it was grade one i kissed some girl wow that's pretty cool like who the heck was that you kiss
[12078.70 --> 12085.50]  girls you don't even remember them no and this guy says no i don't think i'm that cool damn damn
[12087.66 --> 12092.86]  i've held so many hands i don't even know i don't even know how many heads i've held
[12094.22 --> 12098.78]  if i remember correctly i've had so many cups of tea if i remember correctly one of us was like hurt or
[12098.78 --> 12105.50]  something i pulled on so many pigtails my god if i remember correctly i got so many cooties i'm
[12105.50 --> 12112.22]  just gonna go for it anyways and uh whichever one actually like initiated it did so because like
[12112.22 --> 12115.90]  their parents would do that when they were hurt to try to calm them down yeah it wasn't it wasn't
[12115.90 --> 12120.78]  we're in grade like one it wasn't what you thought wow he's been emotionally intelligent and caring since
[12120.78 --> 12126.46]  wow my look at this guy god you're cool god you're so cool i can't handle you guys
[12127.10 --> 12133.90]  damn my mind paradox says uh yeah definitely friends from grade school i'd love to see again
[12133.90 --> 12139.50]  but high school no interest in talking to all to any of them now i have now i now i have a hypothesis
[12139.50 --> 12144.62]  here and that is not that the people you went to grade school with are like better in some way but
[12144.62 --> 12147.50]  rather that they were at a stage in their life where they hadn't turned into complete
[12147.50 --> 12153.26]  f***ing a**holes yet and so that makes the the elementary school reunion interesting though i see
[12153.26 --> 12157.02]  okay because you didn't get to see that process so it's like what what happened in the gap
[12159.02 --> 12164.30]  how did you get why how do you look like this basically yeah how'd you go from like that kid
[12164.30 --> 12171.74]  that was fun to play soccer with to like i don't know who knows adfaxelstijev says luke's just a
[12171.74 --> 12182.14]  stand-up guy stop oh man yeah okay uh what's going on more we got yeah i got some more merch messages
[12182.14 --> 12187.74]  okay we got some is there more we got some cool people sending merch messages yes how many is there
[12187.74 --> 12192.38]  left you wish they were luke let's let's try to let's try to power through these a little bit okay
[12193.58 --> 12198.94]  i wish there was merino underwear available they're wonderful do you know why some websites don't let you
[12198.94 --> 12204.46]  open certain links in a new i hate that oh my god i know as a habitual control clicker it's infuriating
[12204.46 --> 12209.50]  when i can't i hate it so much also middle clicking does the same thing and it's my favorite i hate it
[12209.50 --> 12215.82]  so much i hate it so much okay so watch this watch this okay so if i'm in the dashboard and i want to
[12215.82 --> 12222.38]  switch accounts and i right click and i right click to oh my god i left clicked okay it doesn't matter
[12222.38 --> 12227.90]  the point is if i want to switch accounts and i right click i want to open a new tab where is my open
[12227.90 --> 12238.22]  in a new job why isn't it there it's not intuitive i love this man
[12240.94 --> 12247.90]  not me just making sure you can do the yes that works okay cool all right good so vindicated uh is
[12247.90 --> 12253.98]  there any pricing available for the commuter backpack i'm hoping 150 or less so i can justify upgrading my
[12253.98 --> 12265.74]  upgrading my upgrading to my upgrading to my wife from the 50 back grab i'm still using from high school
[12267.34 --> 12269.02]  it's just that is what it says
[12271.34 --> 12274.86]  this is the least intuitive merch message i've ever read to my wife
[12274.86 --> 12279.74]  upgrading to my wife from the 50 backpack where are you storing things in your wife that's cool
[12281.02 --> 12289.58]  uh that's quite the upgrade though i can't do this um not a very intuitive upgrading from my wife
[12290.38 --> 12295.82]  upgrading my wife from the 50 backpack i'm still using from high school okay i hurt my hand
[12295.82 --> 12305.02]  i'm not surprised what about it's not too bad it's not too bad um uh we're not announcing the pricing
[12305.02 --> 12311.10]  yet i i we announced that a little early i think the backpack your bag well we got a we got a we got a
[12311.10 --> 12317.34]  wait list we got an email newsletter gotcha yeah yeah yeah no no we got a drum up we ordered a few
[12317.34 --> 12325.82]  oh based on the newsletter or just preemptively just based based just based not on anything just
[12325.82 --> 12336.70]  based like on a like on a turkey base yeah yeah get that meat yeah get that meat gravy
[12338.94 --> 12343.02]  okay we need to get out of here this is what happens if we go past 8 30.
[12343.02 --> 12351.90]  next person keep going hey dill i was using my ltd stubby to fix my dishwasher before when
[12351.90 --> 12355.98]  show nice uh how well can i expect it to hold up to water i don't know you tell me uh it should
[12355.98 --> 12361.50]  be fine the bits might rust a little bit because they're like iron and stuff yeah yeah shaft's okay
[12361.50 --> 12364.70]  yeah yeah just baste it baste shaft
[12364.70 --> 12373.34]  all right keep going okay all right sorry sorry the last one i got for you hey
[12376.54 --> 12382.38]  with your focus on transparency will there be any more how ltd makes money videos i know
[12383.50 --> 12389.98]  were used against you but uh can you look past that i really hope that people were
[12389.98 --> 12396.46]  not here during the start of the show chat understood it apparently but yeah um
[12398.38 --> 12403.26]  i think someone internally pitched a little while ago it might have been adam i think it was adam i'm
[12403.26 --> 12406.46]  not sure don't don't quote me on that i might be wrong about that someone pitched it internally
[12406.46 --> 12413.50]  a little while ago i think we are due for one um i don't know guys like it's uh it's one of those
[12413.50 --> 12419.82]  things where someone in full of my chest i wouldn't the old video still basically apply no i mean and
[12419.82 --> 12425.10]  that's the thing right and that that's why it's changed that transparency is not just once right like
[12425.10 --> 12433.34]  if you if you have a a window in into the front of your house right and you open it for a second and
[12433.34 --> 12439.26]  then you close it that's not transparency that's a glimpse you know uh transparency is a process it's a
[12439.26 --> 12451.18]  mindset it's ongoing and um and so i think in the interest of transparency yeah um i'd like to do
[12451.18 --> 12457.98]  another one but after sort of experiencing the way that people take what i say in those kinds of
[12457.98 --> 12467.66]  behind the scenes looks and extrapolate or um or twist um what i'm saying to turn it into something that i
[12467.66 --> 12474.38]  didn't say i don't know it it definitely it definitely makes me like that one time that
[12474.38 --> 12481.02]  you said that the iphone was an unintuitive mess yeah and had no redeeming qualities yes like the
[12481.02 --> 12488.22]  time i said that um it's really challenging right because i i can't reasonably expect people every
[12488.22 --> 12493.42]  individual person out there to be familiar with everything i've ever said right and so you'll see
[12493.42 --> 12499.98]  like bad faith statements like linus always criticizes the iphone he never criticizes android
[12499.98 --> 12510.94]  so mean um and i think this is one of those content pieces for us that um have a super high potential
[12510.94 --> 12517.98]  for that for people to see just this and and not see the bigger picture or to see it and not believe it
[12517.98 --> 12522.22]  and um and i'm putting myself in a position where they just wouldn't have been thinking about it
[12522.94 --> 12528.38]  if i didn't bring it up i think that's probably the biggest danger is i talk about like you know
[12528.38 --> 12532.86]  i talk about the sponsorships so i talk about integrations or i talk about merch or i talk about
[12532.86 --> 12537.58]  floatplane or you know all the other ways that um that linus media group makes money and you've got
[12537.58 --> 12541.42]  you know the people on the one side that are going that couldn't be all of it what are they hiding
[12541.98 --> 12545.66]  right and then you've got the um and then you've got the people that are like
[12545.66 --> 12551.58]  like oh my god i can't believe that they make so much off of like sponsorships and merch that they
[12551.58 --> 12558.86]  can pay like you know 100 people um i i didn't you know i didn't think about that before i thought
[12558.86 --> 12564.86]  that you know linus was just my friend or whatever and it's like bro why is it a conversation that i'm
[12564.86 --> 12569.82]  even opening up at this point like during wench is you know two and a half three hours into wancho or
[12569.82 --> 12574.78]  whatever we are right now whatever yeah we're three and a half hours into wancho it's like yeah fine we can
[12574.78 --> 12579.02]  kind of talk about this stuff because realistically the only people are going to make that make it past
[12579.02 --> 12585.90]  me insulting their precious ios are going to be people who i think can at least based android users
[12585.90 --> 12596.46]  let's go i think are people who can um see the bigger picture of what we're trying to say and see
[12596.46 --> 12600.38]  that you know for all of our flaws we're trying and sort of take things um
[12600.38 --> 12607.18]  um take things that we say and take the things that we do um
[12610.14 --> 12616.78]  if a positive with a set of positive assumptions rather than a set of negative assumptions whereas
[12616.78 --> 12623.82]  like a mainline channel video it's not really like that so we'll see uh i think that uh right now this
[12623.82 --> 12628.38]  is not a good time of year to go bug the accounting department to create a bunch of extra like presentation
[12628.38 --> 12636.38]  slides for us they they've got to do uh a lot of new good but new goalposts things to work on yeah
[12636.38 --> 12643.66]  but maybe next year we'll see okay uh can canal asks timeline for backpack carabiners you should
[12643.66 --> 12646.54]  have them already if you don't contact support
[12649.58 --> 12656.38]  and i'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[12659.18 --> 12665.18]  dude it was so hard not to talk about this oh you can't lean over here i know it's fine
[12668.54 --> 12671.18]  i know right
