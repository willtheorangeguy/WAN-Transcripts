[0.00 --> 4.12]  Positive vibes all of y'all. Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show.
[4.14 --> 5.12]  What the heck?
[5.48 --> 7.94]  We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[8.12 --> 15.28]  The new Apple Mac Mini looks absolutely flipping outstanding to the point where I am starting to wonder,
[16.12 --> 20.40]  if you're a non-gamer, is there any other computer that matters?
[20.94 --> 22.54]  I mean, you'll be able to play Cyberpunk on it soon.
[22.66 --> 24.04]  That's a strong statement, I know.
[24.84 --> 28.50]  But I might end up standing behind it depending on how our testing of it goes.
[28.66 --> 28.94]  Wow.
[28.94 --> 33.66]  I'm open to having my opinions changed, but right now, I'm liking it a lot.
[34.00 --> 37.22]  We're also going to be talking about playing Minecraft with AI.
[37.48 --> 38.08]  That's right.
[38.54 --> 41.26]  AI company, Descartes, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[41.34 --> 46.02]  The point is, they've released a playable AI model that was trained on Minecraft
[46.02 --> 50.80]  that allows you to play Minecraft without actually playing the game of Minecraft.
[51.16 --> 51.42]  Wow.
[51.84 --> 55.48]  No textures, no game engine, no nothing, just AI.
[55.62 --> 56.72]  That sounds like the worst.
[57.16 --> 58.38]  Well, we're going to try it.
[58.38 --> 58.84]  All right.
[58.94 --> 59.50]  You get to try it.
[59.52 --> 60.22]  It's playable in a browser.
[60.44 --> 61.68]  Very playable.
[62.22 --> 62.86]  Doesn't it play it?
[63.66 --> 64.20]  Oh, no, no.
[64.26 --> 64.74]  You play it.
[64.86 --> 65.12]  Oh.
[65.94 --> 66.82]  You'll figure it out.
[67.22 --> 67.80]  He'll figure it out.
[67.84 --> 68.30]  What else we got?
[68.66 --> 71.66]  I fix it, figured it out, and they have fixed McDonald's...
[71.66 --> 75.92]  They have fixed McDonald's soft serve machine problem.
[75.92 --> 81.76]  So that's good if you want ice cream and good if you care about right for repair for one particular
[81.76 --> 83.08]  extremely wealthy company.
[83.80 --> 87.02]  Also, multiple people did really cool things with hardware.
[87.26 --> 88.06]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[88.06 --> 88.34]  Okay.
[88.40 --> 88.98]  Well, we'll get it.
[89.04 --> 89.22]  Okay.
[89.22 --> 90.60]  Not the wealthy company thing.
[90.66 --> 91.42]  We'll get to that later.
[91.56 --> 92.46]  It actually matters a lot.
[93.74 --> 95.24]  And we have someone who took...
[95.24 --> 96.10]  I can't find it here.
[96.36 --> 97.08]  Did it make it?
[97.44 --> 98.04]  Ah, yes.
[98.04 --> 100.52]  Spotify's car thing is saved.
[121.52 --> 125.36]  The show is brought to you today by Manscaped, 1Password, and Squarespace.
[125.36 --> 130.92]  And, of course, by our chair partner, Secret Lab, our laptop partner, LG, and our wrap partner,
[131.36 --> 131.78]  dbrand.
[132.58 --> 138.38]  Let's jump right into our headline topic, which is, of course, the Apple Mac Mini with
[138.38 --> 140.98]  their new M4 processor.
[141.48 --> 146.36]  Apple began the week by announcing a new Mac every day to help keep the...
[147.06 --> 148.98]  I mean, doctor away, I guess, right?
[149.08 --> 150.26]  Like, that's got to be the joke.
[150.28 --> 150.94]  Is that the joke?
[151.04 --> 151.46]  I hope so.
[151.56 --> 151.92]  I guess so.
[151.92 --> 159.94]  They began with the M4 iMac, followed by the redesigned Mac Mini and a refreshed lineup
[159.94 --> 161.12]  of MacBook Pros.
[161.98 --> 168.12]  In addition to the M4, Apple, likewise, announced the M4 Pro, which is available for the Mac Mini
[168.12 --> 170.92]  and MacBook Pro lineup, and the M4 Max...
[170.92 --> 171.06]  Not the iMac?
[172.06 --> 172.24]  Sorry?
[172.64 --> 173.46]  Not the iMac?
[173.58 --> 177.94]  No, the iMac was only M1 last time around, if I recall correctly.
[178.00 --> 178.52]  I don't know why.
[178.52 --> 184.52]  I could be a little rusty on that, but if I recall correctly, it was only available because...
[185.18 --> 185.76]  I don't know.
[185.88 --> 186.42]  It's just...
[186.42 --> 190.80]  It's basically a screen with a basic computer in it, I think, is kind of the idea.
[190.90 --> 192.18]  It's the Facebook surfing machine.
[192.44 --> 192.52]  Sure.
[193.32 --> 197.02]  People would probably give them a hard time if it did have a high-end processor in it because
[197.02 --> 200.88]  it would be priced so much for such a basic Facebook browsing machine.
[200.88 --> 203.58]  All right.
[203.62 --> 204.76]  Anyway, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[205.04 --> 206.28]  And the M4 Max...
[206.28 --> 206.50]  Okay.
[206.78 --> 211.04]  And the M4 Max, which is only available in the MacBook Pros.
[211.68 --> 218.68]  Max with an M4 Pro or Max will now have multiple Thunderbolt 5 ports rather than Thunderbolt 4,
[218.84 --> 220.54]  which I'm extremely excited about.
[220.60 --> 222.96]  We'll talk about in just a moment here.
[222.96 --> 227.86]  And for the first time, the newest generation of iMac will have support for two screens.
[229.22 --> 230.98]  All right.
[231.28 --> 236.30]  The Mac Mini, though, is the one that I want to talk about because some of the...
[236.30 --> 236.44]  Okay.
[236.64 --> 237.48]  Notes are...
[237.48 --> 239.64]  We didn't give them much time to work on the notes today.
[240.48 --> 245.76]  And unfortunately, I really need to look at the dock here one second.
[246.00 --> 248.24]  Or at my spreadsheet where I added the topic.
[249.08 --> 249.48]  M4.
[249.64 --> 250.24]  Here we go.
[250.24 --> 252.20]  Oh, nope.
[252.32 --> 253.38]  This is a previous week.
[253.48 --> 253.86]  Oh, boy.
[253.90 --> 254.96]  We're off to a really good start today.
[255.22 --> 255.54]  Okay.
[256.38 --> 257.36]  The Mac Mini.
[258.18 --> 260.28]  Luke, let's go shopping.
[260.72 --> 261.04]  Okay.
[261.78 --> 263.68]  That's what I want to do for this segment.
[263.78 --> 264.00]  All right.
[264.14 --> 267.42]  So I'm going to be a Mac and you're going to be a PC.
[267.70 --> 268.04]  Oh, boy.
[268.04 --> 269.68]  So I'm going to go on Apple.com.
[269.80 --> 272.12]  I'm just going to pick another country or region.
[272.36 --> 272.86]  Sorry, hold on.
[272.92 --> 273.86]  I blue screened.
[274.54 --> 275.10]  Got them.
[275.76 --> 279.66]  So I'm going to go to the United States and you're going to go on PC Part Picker.
[280.98 --> 281.26]  Okay.
[282.48 --> 283.12]  Here we go.
[283.90 --> 289.74]  I'm going to shop for a Mac and you're going to try to build a PC for the same price as
[289.74 --> 289.98]  me.
[290.32 --> 292.50]  So for starters here, let's...
[292.50 --> 292.98]  Here we go.
[293.08 --> 294.38]  Mac Mini pre-order.
[294.80 --> 297.94]  Let's have a look at the price that you're going to be looking at.
[297.94 --> 299.84]  So we're going to go with the...
[299.84 --> 302.02]  Let's go with the starting Mac Mini.
[302.36 --> 302.54]  Okay.
[302.54 --> 305.72]  That comes in at $599 US.
[306.30 --> 307.78]  $600 US dollars.
[307.90 --> 313.44]  So Luke, why don't you put together a pretty decent machine for $600 US dollars?
[314.24 --> 317.14]  It's been a while since Luke has really, you know...
[317.14 --> 317.84]  Shopped for computer components?
[317.84 --> 322.48]  Shopped for a computer because he's gotten them for free since he started here, which
[322.48 --> 323.62]  was like 12 years ago.
[323.64 --> 324.50]  No, it was before then.
[324.66 --> 324.92]  Yeah.
[325.18 --> 326.88]  I believe in him.
[326.98 --> 328.04]  I believe that he can do it.
[328.08 --> 329.96]  And guys, chat, feel free to pitch in.
[330.34 --> 334.62]  Feel free to pitch in and give Luke some ideas for starting points for things like, you
[334.62 --> 335.18]  know, CPU.
[335.56 --> 336.02]  If there's any...
[336.02 --> 337.00]  And how much are motherboards these days?
[337.00 --> 338.26]  ...chipsets he should be looking at.
[338.36 --> 338.88]  Motherboards...
[338.88 --> 339.32]  My man.
[339.74 --> 340.80]  There's so much.
[340.86 --> 342.80]  Motherboards have spiked in a big way.
[342.82 --> 344.64]  They kind of ruined this whole thing, to be honest.
[345.02 --> 350.54]  You used to be able to get a pretty decent board for like $80 US dollars.
[350.62 --> 351.74]  $70 US dollars.
[351.74 --> 351.98]  Yeah.
[352.34 --> 352.54]  Yeah.
[352.62 --> 352.86]  Yeah.
[353.08 --> 353.26]  Yeah.
[353.32 --> 357.52]  Like Canadian, you'd probably be looking at more like $115, $120.
[357.82 --> 358.14]  Yes.
[358.40 --> 365.36]  But now, like a decent motherboard, you're looking at like more like $120, $140 US dollars.
[365.86 --> 367.88]  Unless you're willing to make some compromises.
[367.88 --> 372.52]  There are lower end chipsets, but sometimes they can come with pretty bad compromises.
[373.22 --> 376.80]  Especially if you want a machine that you're going to be able to kind of upgrade for a
[376.80 --> 379.64]  while, add more M.2 storage and stuff like that.
[379.96 --> 380.74]  So wait, how much do I have?
[380.80 --> 382.36]  $600 US dollars?
[382.48 --> 382.60]  Yeah.
[382.76 --> 384.00]  And you're on PC Part Picker.
[384.04 --> 385.48]  I believe that's in US by default.
[385.70 --> 386.20]  Yeah, I think so.
[387.88 --> 388.24]  Yes.
[388.52 --> 388.74]  Okay.
[388.86 --> 390.14]  So guys, feel free.
[390.34 --> 391.16]  Feel free to pitch in.
[391.80 --> 394.86]  I don't see anyone trying to help you, which is a little discouraging.
[395.02 --> 396.02]  Get a 4090.
[396.96 --> 397.32]  Sure.
[397.88 --> 399.92]  Oh, man.
[401.34 --> 402.48]  How much RAM does yours have?
[402.78 --> 403.18]  Okay.
[403.34 --> 403.78]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[403.88 --> 404.26]  So...
[404.26 --> 405.58]  Yeah, can I know some specs on your site?
[405.58 --> 406.12]  Yeah, absolutely.
[406.36 --> 407.44]  This is very exciting.
[407.88 --> 414.84]  For the first time, I think ever, Apple has finally acknowledged that the year is now 2020
[414.84 --> 420.36]  plus and they no longer are offering a base model machine with only 8 gigs of RAM.
[420.80 --> 423.82]  They have 16 gigs of RAM in that base model.
[423.94 --> 427.46]  So, Luke, why don't you go ahead and find yourself a 16 gig...
[427.46 --> 428.14]  What are you doing?
[428.26 --> 428.88]  No, don't just...
[428.88 --> 429.94]  Don't do that.
[430.02 --> 430.66]  Build a computer.
[430.88 --> 431.12]  Jeez.
[431.12 --> 435.06]  Okay, so find yourself a nice 16 gig kit of RAM.
[439.96 --> 440.58]  Smaller, too.
[440.90 --> 442.04]  Our button's in the right place.
[442.04 --> 442.14]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[442.14 --> 442.32]  Sorry, sorry.
[442.32 --> 442.60]  Memory.
[443.14 --> 443.56]  Okay, yeah.
[443.90 --> 444.50]  16 gigs?
[444.58 --> 448.56]  Yeah, you need 16 gigs of RAM to match the base model new Mac Mini.
[448.86 --> 453.84]  See, PCs are a little bit too based, which is part of the problem, because they automatically
[453.84 --> 455.46]  assume you want 2 times 16.
[455.48 --> 456.58]  Yeah, you've got filters.
[456.62 --> 457.78]  You've got filters on the left.
[457.80 --> 458.68]  No, you don't need that.
[458.88 --> 460.42]  You just need even more RAM.
[460.60 --> 461.58]  Yeah, I suppose so.
[461.58 --> 465.12]  The problem with this whole contest is that we are lowering ourselves.
[465.88 --> 466.66]  Oh, my goodness.
[467.48 --> 467.64]  Okay.
[468.20 --> 469.86]  We're not actually competing.
[470.04 --> 472.26]  Just configure a computer, for crying out loud.
[472.46 --> 473.24]  Are you a politician?
[473.40 --> 474.18]  You're too good at this.
[474.20 --> 474.68]  This guy.
[476.38 --> 477.44]  How much storage do you have?
[477.94 --> 478.34]  Okay.
[478.56 --> 481.64]  That's where things do fall apart a little bit.
[481.66 --> 482.38]  That's assuming one terabyte.
[482.54 --> 486.32]  I only get 256 gigs of storage.
[486.38 --> 487.90]  Can I even select that?
[488.12 --> 490.58]  I only get 256 gigs of storage.
[490.58 --> 498.00]  And that is a pretty frustrating thing that remains still about Apple's lineup, is how much
[498.00 --> 501.32]  they charge for really small amounts of storage.
[501.44 --> 506.62]  And what's especially frustrating about it for me is I know that a big part of why they're
[506.62 --> 514.78]  charging so much for it is that the sweet spot for price to capacity has moved past 256 gigs.
[514.78 --> 522.28]  So they're charging so much for it because it's just a terrible value on a component level to build such a tiny SSD these days.
[522.28 --> 527.90]  The sweet spot for capacity is probably more like in the one terabyte range now.
[527.90 --> 533.78]  With that said, I'm trying to think how many dyes would be on a one terabyte drive now.
[533.86 --> 536.30]  Is it one or two for the most part?
[536.30 --> 539.66]  I think it would be two.
[539.82 --> 542.22]  I haven't looked that closely at them in the last probably year.
[542.30 --> 544.02]  So apparently you can do them with one.
[544.08 --> 544.18]  Yeah.
[544.26 --> 549.02]  So that sweet spot is definitely more like in that one terabyte range.
[549.02 --> 557.02]  So you are, you're basically just like wasting silicon to make 256 gig storage.
[559.26 --> 565.24]  So that's, that's going to, that's going to kind of impede Luke because he's not going to get a great deal on his SSD.
[565.76 --> 565.94]  Yeah.
[566.02 --> 567.10]  It was 18 bucks.
[567.24 --> 568.44]  Whereas if I start, oh, okay.
[568.48 --> 569.32]  That's not that bad.
[569.36 --> 570.32]  That's still pretty good actually.
[570.32 --> 576.62]  So it looks like there's a really broad sweet spot these days then because you'll probably pay.
[576.62 --> 579.00]  Oh yeah, no, no, yeah, no.
[579.16 --> 579.60]  That's yeah.
[579.60 --> 580.18]  That's a bad deal.
[580.84 --> 593.94]  Cause the thing is you, there's, there's a certain amount of cost that is just in the cost of making anything at all and shipping it and QAing it and developing it.
[595.38 --> 597.76]  So there's only so cheap that you can make something.
[597.76 --> 601.80]  That's why, that's why you can buy a hard drive, like a modern hard drive for $250.
[601.80 --> 609.30]  And you can't buy one that is one 20th the capacity for $12 because you just, you still have to put a motor in it.
[609.48 --> 611.44]  You still have to ship it around the world.
[611.50 --> 613.50]  You still have to pay someone to assembly, assemble it.
[613.56 --> 618.28]  It's like there's, there's, there's, there's just fixed costs that are associated with bringing a product to market at all.
[618.80 --> 619.32]  Um, okay.
[619.42 --> 620.44]  Sorry, we're back on Luke's laptop.
[620.52 --> 620.82]  What do you got?
[620.88 --> 621.14]  What do you got?
[621.14 --> 623.88]  Do I need to, uh, buy an operating system?
[624.36 --> 625.66]  Well, I mean, then that comes with one.
[625.82 --> 627.16]  That's what I thought you were going to say.
[627.16 --> 635.98]  Well, but with that said, with that said, we have a video coming in a little while about how windows doesn't necessarily, uh, you can, it can be obtained for a lot less than $120.
[636.24 --> 636.70]  So why don't you leave?
[636.82 --> 637.18]  You know what?
[637.50 --> 640.20]  I'm nothing if not, uh, gracious and benevolent.
[640.36 --> 640.66]  Gracious and kind.
[640.78 --> 641.14]  Uh, yeah.
[641.16 --> 642.44]  So leave out the operating system.
[642.50 --> 643.50]  This is where I'm at currently.
[643.58 --> 644.52]  Take the operating system out.
[644.58 --> 644.80]  Okay.
[645.22 --> 646.20]  So we're going to Luke laptop.
[646.52 --> 646.74]  Okay.
[646.74 --> 647.40]  What do you, what do you got?
[647.50 --> 647.80]  What do you got?
[647.80 --> 648.38]  Walk us through it.
[648.46 --> 652.48]  Ryzen 5 7600X, uh, which is the first thing I chose.
[652.60 --> 654.84]  So I didn't really spec it in too much.
[654.84 --> 659.62]  Um, one of the cheapest motherboards I could find ended up being MATX.
[659.78 --> 659.96]  Yep.
[660.04 --> 670.84]  16 gigs of acceptable Ram, um, a SSD that you shouldn't buy to be completely honest, but it fits the storage thing of, of your side.
[671.20 --> 674.08]  Um, a relatively cheap MATX case.
[674.14 --> 674.32]  Yep.
[674.36 --> 676.36]  But like attractive, you know, it's all right.
[676.40 --> 677.06]  It's not bad.
[677.08 --> 678.14]  You're going up against Apple.
[678.18 --> 681.74]  You're going to have to have a reasonably, you know, decent looking case.
[681.74 --> 681.94]  Yeah.
[681.94 --> 682.48]  It looks nice.
[682.48 --> 684.96]  Like, so I, I didn't go for just a piece of junk.
[685.66 --> 693.20]  Um, and I found one of the cheapest 600 watt power supplies I could find, which is overkill wattage wise, but I didn't really want to get like something.
[693.76 --> 693.88]  Yep.
[694.02 --> 696.68]  Something that Lucas would warn you is going to blow up.
[696.80 --> 696.88]  Yeah.
[696.88 --> 698.30]  This one was decently rated.
[699.14 --> 701.80]  Um, it's sort of okay.
[701.98 --> 702.16]  Yeah.
[702.16 --> 702.48]  Sure.
[702.90 --> 703.14]  Okay.
[703.70 --> 705.64]  Um, and I've got a little bit more money to play with.
[705.70 --> 705.82]  Yeah.
[705.82 --> 706.96]  You've got some more money to spend.
[707.38 --> 711.72]  Um, with that said, you might have some, you might have some things to kind of deal with here.
[711.72 --> 712.46]  Do you have wifi?
[712.98 --> 713.64]  Cause I do.
[713.72 --> 714.34]  Yeah, I think so.
[714.52 --> 714.98]  Are you sure?
[715.06 --> 716.38]  I think this board has it actually.
[717.48 --> 719.78]  Oh, I'd be pretty surprised at that price point.
[719.86 --> 720.02]  Nope.
[720.62 --> 720.90]  Okay.
[720.94 --> 722.42]  So you're, you're probably going to need some wifi.
[722.56 --> 723.42]  Why don't you go get some wifi?
[723.66 --> 724.10]  I can get wifi.
[724.40 --> 725.10]  Okay, cool.
[725.50 --> 726.30]  I also need a cooler.
[726.80 --> 727.54]  Uh, nope, nope.
[727.56 --> 728.32]  That should come with a cooler.
[728.44 --> 728.74]  Are you sure?
[728.78 --> 728.94]  Yep.
[728.94 --> 729.50]  You should be good to go.
[729.58 --> 730.64]  It looks like the slim box.
[731.62 --> 732.74]  Oh, shoot.
[732.82 --> 733.68]  Oh, that's a 7600.
[733.90 --> 734.14]  Yeah.
[734.24 --> 734.40]  Yeah.
[734.40 --> 735.06]  You're going to need a cooler.
[735.68 --> 735.96]  Yep.
[735.96 --> 736.50]  You'll need a cooler.
[736.56 --> 737.12]  You'll need a cooler.
[737.20 --> 737.84]  You'll need some wifi.
[737.84 --> 741.10]  I might have some other things to inform you that you're going to need, but why don't
[741.10 --> 743.66]  you go ahead and add those first and see how it goes for you.
[744.82 --> 747.60]  Do I just get a cooler that I know won't fit in this case at all?
[747.70 --> 748.54]  I just not worry about it.
[748.76 --> 749.78]  Uh, no, no.
[749.84 --> 752.14]  I think you're probably going to need a cooler that fits in your case.
[752.56 --> 752.98]  Smart guy.
[752.98 --> 753.04]  Why?
[753.64 --> 756.28]  I could get something huge and it would be cool.
[756.42 --> 756.56]  Yeah.
[756.56 --> 759.38]  You could just hot rod it, you know, let it stick out the side of the case.
[759.38 --> 764.44]  I won't get something way too big, but I also just like don't actually know what would fit
[764.44 --> 764.76]  in here.
[766.52 --> 767.02]  I don't know.
[767.06 --> 768.66]  Maybe you guys can, maybe you guys can help them.
[769.00 --> 770.34]  Maybe you guys can help them a little bit.
[770.62 --> 774.90]  Like a low profile AM5, uh, $55 for a knock to a cooler.
[775.00 --> 775.10]  Yeah.
[775.10 --> 776.12]  I don't think we're going to be doing that.
[776.42 --> 778.22]  I think PC part picker has clearance.
[778.62 --> 779.54]  Assume that this one fits.
[779.58 --> 779.74]  Sure.
[779.94 --> 780.30]  You know what?
[780.32 --> 781.14]  It's not mad at me.
[781.28 --> 781.64]  Good enough.
[781.70 --> 781.88]  Okay.
[781.90 --> 783.30]  Go find, go find a wifi card.
[783.94 --> 785.10]  Or do I just upgrade the motherboard?
[785.94 --> 788.04]  You could upgrade to a motherboard with onboard wifi.
[788.04 --> 788.70]  Yeah, totally.
[788.70 --> 789.86]  A hundred bucks.
[790.54 --> 793.36]  Let's see if I bonk that out, what I can get.
[794.22 --> 794.80]  He bonked it.
[794.92 --> 796.38]  Uh, you can filter by having wifi.
[796.56 --> 798.26]  I think this is only like 20 something dollars more.
[798.50 --> 800.16]  Uh, is there a wifi thing?
[800.36 --> 800.72]  Probably.
[801.46 --> 802.28]  I would think so.
[802.30 --> 804.20]  They've got pretty good, pretty good filters.
[805.02 --> 807.12]  Onboard ethernet, onboard video.
[808.04 --> 808.68]  I believe.
[808.80 --> 809.86]  Hey, look at that.
[810.00 --> 811.08]  Oh, um, yeah.
[811.08 --> 813.72]  You're going to need like pretty good wifi by the way.
[813.82 --> 814.90]  Your wifi seven or what?
[815.42 --> 818.18]  Uh, I'm just going to check real quick, but I think so.
[818.18 --> 819.10]  It's either that or 60.
[819.24 --> 819.60]  You know what?
[819.66 --> 823.76]  I'll, I'll, I'll allow 60, but I'm going to double, I'm going to double check what kind
[823.76 --> 825.38]  of, uh, what kind of wifi I have.
[827.88 --> 828.24]  Ugh.
[828.90 --> 831.68]  I mean, Apple has its own issues with shopping.
[831.82 --> 833.60]  It doesn't even freaking say.
[833.72 --> 834.46]  60 apparently.
[834.84 --> 835.12]  60.
[835.26 --> 835.48]  Okay.
[835.54 --> 835.92]  There you go.
[836.30 --> 836.56]  Okay.
[836.56 --> 837.60]  So you can have wifi 60.
[837.88 --> 838.20]  Okay.
[838.92 --> 839.32]  Okay.
[840.36 --> 841.14]  What are you at?
[843.00 --> 844.02]  How you doing for pricing?
[844.28 --> 845.16]  It saves me $10.
[847.26 --> 847.62]  $560.
[848.08 --> 848.48]  Wow.
[849.02 --> 850.66]  PC is $40 ahead.
[850.90 --> 852.04]  Uh, you're going to need thunderbolt.
[852.90 --> 853.18]  Oh.
[854.88 --> 856.10]  Can I sort by that?
[856.20 --> 857.10]  I don't, this thing has thunderbolt.
[857.10 --> 859.66]  I'll tell you what, I'll allow, I'll allow no thunderbolt.
[859.80 --> 860.82]  I'll allow no thunderbolt.
[860.82 --> 865.22]  Uh, but you will, that what you will need is some USB-C ports.
[865.38 --> 866.56]  You got any USB-C ports?
[866.70 --> 867.02]  I think so.
[868.06 --> 869.08]  Does the case have any?
[870.32 --> 871.70]  That's not the right picture.
[875.32 --> 875.68]  Yep.
[876.30 --> 877.24]  You've got USB-C?
[877.34 --> 877.86]  At least one.
[877.98 --> 878.70]  You've got at least one?
[878.70 --> 879.96]  Does your motherboard support it?
[880.26 --> 882.14]  Does it have a front header for USB-C?
[882.78 --> 883.14]  Ooh.
[883.62 --> 884.02]  Ooh.
[885.82 --> 886.26]  Ooh.
[886.26 --> 886.62]  Ooh.
[892.14 --> 892.96]  Oh, man.
[896.24 --> 896.94]  What do you got?
[897.20 --> 897.88]  What do you got, Luke?
[898.10 --> 898.62]  I'm trying to see.
[901.24 --> 901.76]  Oh, yeah.
[901.82 --> 903.72]  USB 3.2 Gen 1 headers.
[904.10 --> 904.54]  Let's go.
[904.60 --> 905.16]  Yeah, you got it.
[905.26 --> 905.72]  You got it.
[905.74 --> 907.54]  If that's, uh, if that suspects for the board there.
[907.64 --> 907.90]  That is.
[907.90 --> 909.18]  Wait, you have an ITX board?
[910.04 --> 910.46]  Uh, yeah.
[910.60 --> 911.80]  And now we have an MATX case.
[911.86 --> 913.58]  You're making me change things on the fly, my guy.
[913.58 --> 915.48]  Well, look, I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm just trying to help you.
[915.48 --> 916.32]  The RAM still fits.
[916.42 --> 917.56]  Everything still technically works.
[917.56 --> 918.84]  I'm just trying to help you beat me.
[919.02 --> 920.20]  You need a 10-core CPU.
[920.80 --> 921.36]  Oh, fuck.
[922.72 --> 923.12]  Language.
[923.12 --> 925.08]  Uh, I didn't actually say a word.
[925.24 --> 926.44]  I just made a sound.
[926.82 --> 929.44]  If it's got to have thunderbolt, then it needs to be Intel, right?
[929.70 --> 930.78]  Um, no, no.
[930.92 --> 932.42]  No, he gave me a pass on that one.
[932.42 --> 937.02]  And USB 4 is, in some ways, functionally the same.
[937.36 --> 938.56]  Don't mention the graphics card.
[938.56 --> 938.76]  Jesus.
[942.48 --> 943.12]  Shut up.
[943.64 --> 945.18]  So, uh, okay.
[945.52 --> 947.14]  Where's your 10-core CPU at?
[947.24 --> 947.58]  Hold on.
[947.62 --> 948.74]  Is there a core count?
[948.80 --> 949.32]  Yeah, there we go.
[950.12 --> 950.42]  Oh, wait.
[950.48 --> 950.60]  No.
[950.74 --> 951.26]  Other way around.
[951.74 --> 953.98]  Technically, every word is just a sound, so.
[954.10 --> 956.90]  Hey, well, we don't need to get into technicalities over here.
[956.90 --> 957.84]  Okay, so here we go.
[958.12 --> 962.08]  See, I actually can't, because I can only get better than that, unfortunately.
[963.16 --> 965.42]  Also, not all cores are made the same.
[966.18 --> 967.92]  Your cores are going to need to be pretty good.
[968.84 --> 969.20]  Yeah.
[969.38 --> 971.86]  I mean, we don't need to get into that.
[971.86 --> 973.74]  Also, you're going to need a pretty decent GPU.
[978.88 --> 979.28]  Okay.
[979.56 --> 984.38]  Why don't you throw, just for the sake of argument, why don't you throw, like, a 30-50?
[984.74 --> 986.34]  Why don't you throw a 30-50 in there?
[986.90 --> 990.26]  That's what you're saying is a pretty good GPU?
[990.50 --> 991.86]  Well, it's onboard.
[992.08 --> 997.30]  You're going to need what would be an extremely good onboard GPU.
[999.06 --> 1004.18]  California 909 says, 10-core ARM isn't the same as 10-core x86.
[1004.82 --> 1012.62]  California 909 needs to get caught up on some tech tips, because ARM versus x86 is not the
[1012.62 --> 1013.36]  whole story.
[1013.36 --> 1019.84]  It's down to the actual design of the cores.
[1020.22 --> 1023.72]  And no, that is not the case.
[1025.66 --> 1027.32]  Do we have to do the 10-core thing?
[1028.76 --> 1031.04]  Because there's actually just, like, not very many of those.
[1031.18 --> 1031.62]  Tell you what.
[1031.74 --> 1032.14]  Tell you what.
[1032.30 --> 1036.40]  As long as you have a really solid 8-core CPU, I'll allow it.
[1036.40 --> 1036.52]  Okay.
[1037.02 --> 1037.64]  Current gen.
[1037.64 --> 1039.36]  Yeah.
[1039.56 --> 1041.96]  Yeah, you're not going to be able to use a 7,000 series.
[1042.02 --> 1042.20]  Okay, wait, no.
[1042.38 --> 1043.12]  That's not current.
[1043.56 --> 1043.64]  Okay.
[1043.64 --> 1043.92]  Shh.
[1044.60 --> 1045.00]  Uh.
[1047.00 --> 1051.28]  Now that he's working on labs, he's going to be such a liability on the web show.
[1055.50 --> 1056.42]  Oh, man.
[1056.98 --> 1057.80]  It was great.
[1058.36 --> 1060.46]  Wait, so isn't that the processor that I had?
[1060.46 --> 1061.90]  No, you had a 7,000 series.
[1061.90 --> 1063.68]  You're going to need 9,000 series, my guy.
[1064.90 --> 1067.16]  Oh, but no one actually likes those.
[1067.24 --> 1068.30]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[1068.42 --> 1069.14]  You're going to need a...
[1069.14 --> 1070.36]  But they're not very good.
[1070.78 --> 1071.66]  They're fast.
[1072.42 --> 1073.02]  And efficient.
[1073.82 --> 1077.02]  I mean, I'm going to draw way less power than you even with 9,000 series.
[1077.02 --> 1077.40]  I think 7,000 series is fine.
[1077.40 --> 1079.00]  Fine, as long as you've got 8 cores, I'll allow it.
[1079.06 --> 1079.42]  Yeah.
[1079.68 --> 1080.64]  8 cores, I'll allow it.
[1080.66 --> 1082.20]  I genuinely think that processor was fine.
[1083.92 --> 1084.30]  All right.
[1084.90 --> 1085.90]  How you doing over there?
[1086.80 --> 1087.88]  Good gravy.
[1088.88 --> 1090.04]  Goodness gracious.
[1090.04 --> 1091.56]  The GPU is really the problem.
[1091.96 --> 1093.88]  I mean, the whole thing is really the problem.
[1094.04 --> 1095.26]  Now it's my turn to shop.
[1095.26 --> 1096.24]  Does this thing have integrated graphics?
[1096.44 --> 1097.36]  Now it's my turn to shop.
[1098.52 --> 1100.16]  Yeah, but not good enough.
[1100.32 --> 1100.82]  They don't compare?
[1101.64 --> 1102.52]  Check this out.
[1103.12 --> 1107.10]  For $600, I'm getting a 10-core CPU.
[1108.04 --> 1109.94]  Whatever 10-core GPU means.
[1109.94 --> 1114.62]  But their onboard GPU on M4 is quite nice.
[1115.46 --> 1116.06]  16 gigs.
[1116.06 --> 1118.68]  What if you make that storage a respectable amount?
[1118.86 --> 1119.50]  Well, we'll get to that.
[1119.50 --> 1120.82]  What happens to the competition then?
[1120.88 --> 1121.78]  We'll get to that in a minute.
[1121.90 --> 1122.02]  Yeah?
[1122.14 --> 1128.72]  First up, I'm getting 16 gigs of unified memory and 256 gigs of SSD storage, which, honestly
[1128.72 --> 1133.02]  speaking, I actually don't mind as much as them nerfing the RAM.
[1133.56 --> 1133.88]  Oh.
[1133.88 --> 1141.48]  Because as someone who's going to use a NAS anyway and who doesn't need storage on my PC.
[1141.70 --> 1143.10]  Honestly, we tried to roll out...
[1143.10 --> 1144.30]  Sorry to cut you off.
[1144.44 --> 1144.52]  Yeah.
[1144.52 --> 1147.48]  But we tried to roll out some new standardized laptops.
[1147.64 --> 1148.82]  Dan will know about this, too.
[1149.20 --> 1150.12]  To the business team.
[1150.20 --> 1156.70]  And we got viciously screamed and yelled at by your employees because of not having enough RAM.
[1156.76 --> 1157.36]  No, they were fine.
[1157.36 --> 1159.98]  But 16 gigs of RAM, they didn't like it.
[1160.68 --> 1160.90]  Really?
[1161.10 --> 1161.26]  Yeah.
[1161.36 --> 1161.54]  Who?
[1161.72 --> 1162.12]  Sorry, what?
[1162.26 --> 1162.52]  For what?
[1162.58 --> 1163.32]  Business team capping out.
[1163.40 --> 1163.92]  Too many tabs.
[1164.10 --> 1164.82]  Too many tabs?
[1164.86 --> 1165.74]  So many Chrome tabs.
[1165.84 --> 1166.16]  Too many tabs.
[1166.16 --> 1167.00]  That is hilarious.
[1167.24 --> 1170.88]  We've been through two or three laptops for some people because they have so many tabs
[1170.88 --> 1172.36]  that it just explodes.
[1172.88 --> 1173.24]  Okay.
[1173.64 --> 1174.00]  Interesting.
[1174.26 --> 1174.50]  Yeah.
[1174.50 --> 1174.98]  All right.
[1174.98 --> 1177.92]  So let's go back to my customizing my Mac Mini.
[1178.00 --> 1180.98]  I think we need to configure your RAM up and your storage up.
[1181.28 --> 1184.14]  Well, yeah, but you only have 16 gigs of RAM, so that would affect your budget, too.
[1184.14 --> 1184.42]  I can do that, too.
[1184.42 --> 1184.50]  Hold on.
[1184.68 --> 1185.34]  We'll get to it.
[1185.42 --> 1186.36]  I suspect yours will go up more.
[1186.40 --> 1191.96]  The point is, I don't mind the SSD that much because I'm using a NAS for storage anyway.
[1192.36 --> 1192.58]  All right.
[1192.60 --> 1194.18]  I got three Thunderbolt 4 ports.
[1194.24 --> 1199.38]  I have an HDMI port, a couple USB-C ports in addition to my Thunderbolt ports.
[1199.82 --> 1200.44]  Headphone jack.
[1200.50 --> 1200.72]  Okay.
[1201.26 --> 1201.76]  Hold on.
[1201.80 --> 1202.06]  Hold on.
[1202.12 --> 1203.50]  We're going to get to RAM.
[1203.50 --> 1204.44]  We're going to get to RAM in a second.
[1204.50 --> 1204.86]  Whoa!
[1205.06 --> 1205.68]  First of all...
[1205.68 --> 1206.22]  Those are expensive.
[1206.42 --> 1207.24]  I don't want to talk about this.
[1207.34 --> 1212.22]  First of all, for my NAS, I'm going to need 10 gig.
[1212.78 --> 1214.74]  I don't really need Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro.
[1215.42 --> 1215.82]  That's fair.
[1215.82 --> 1222.02]  The point is, at the starting, at the base configuration, this...
[1222.02 --> 1222.78]  Good enough for most people.
[1222.88 --> 1225.54]  ...is an absolutely killer machine.
[1225.66 --> 1225.82]  Yep.
[1226.32 --> 1231.94]  ...is the only thing that I think that I would recommend for, like, Grandpappy...
[1231.94 --> 1232.36]  Oh, yeah.
[1232.62 --> 1234.30]  ...needs a computer for...
[1234.30 --> 1237.20]  The Mac Mini's have been killer for a long time, and this is honestly a very good jump.
[1237.28 --> 1241.04]  Dude, there's definitely going to be some stuff for us to talk about in the review.
[1241.16 --> 1243.18]  Like, the fact that they put the power button on the bottom.
[1243.34 --> 1244.20]  It's like, why?
[1244.62 --> 1245.94]  How often are you turning off your computer?
[1245.94 --> 1246.50]  Why?
[1246.64 --> 1247.88]  Yeah, but who cares?
[1248.18 --> 1248.54]  Why?
[1249.34 --> 1249.68]  It's like...
[1250.36 --> 1250.96]  Aesthetics.
[1252.60 --> 1253.00]  Aesthetics.
[1253.00 --> 1254.62]  You know, they redesigned the mouse again.
[1254.82 --> 1254.86]  Aesthetics.
[1254.86 --> 1256.78]  And they put the charger on the bottom again.
[1256.86 --> 1258.28]  Is there an Apple logo on the top of it?
[1258.64 --> 1258.96]  Again.
[1259.12 --> 1260.36]  They put the charger on the bottom.
[1260.36 --> 1261.02]  I'm not surprised at all.
[1261.02 --> 1261.22]  Again.
[1261.42 --> 1263.04]  Is there an Apple logo on the top of the Mac Mini?
[1263.14 --> 1264.32]  Like, it's just...
[1264.32 --> 1264.84]  Uh...
[1264.84 --> 1265.04]  Oh.
[1265.84 --> 1266.06]  Here.
[1266.20 --> 1267.12]  We can see the whole gallery.
[1268.18 --> 1268.30]  Right.
[1268.86 --> 1269.06]  Right.
[1269.78 --> 1271.28]  They should have just made that the power button.
[1271.46 --> 1272.52]  Look, and it should glow.
[1272.70 --> 1273.72]  It should glow like the old Mac.
[1273.80 --> 1274.24]  Yeah, why not?
[1274.28 --> 1274.50]  Sure.
[1274.68 --> 1276.12]  Where am I going to put my coffee, then?
[1276.48 --> 1277.26]  Oh, my goodness.
[1277.26 --> 1278.94]  Anyway, the point is...
[1278.94 --> 1281.26]  The point is that...
[1281.26 --> 1282.00]  I don't like that.
[1282.86 --> 1284.98]  This thing is absolutely killer.
[1285.56 --> 1288.62]  Until the second you want to upgrade it.
[1288.62 --> 1291.54]  So this is where things do get a little bit more complicated.
[1292.12 --> 1293.12]  You can see that the...
[1293.12 --> 1293.34]  We're back, baby.
[1293.34 --> 1301.98]  The $800 configuration changes only that you get 256 gigs of storage.
[1302.50 --> 1302.82]  Trash!
[1302.82 --> 1304.18]  Um...
[1304.18 --> 1307.78]  So for context, let's just fire up the old Newegg.com.
[1308.70 --> 1312.00]  What would 256 gigs...
[1312.00 --> 1312.86]  Actually, you know what?
[1312.90 --> 1313.10]  No.
[1313.50 --> 1320.40]  Let's see what 2 terabytes of storage would cost me over on Newegg.com.
[1320.42 --> 1322.90]  Which is, like, gotta be basically...
[1322.90 --> 1326.32]  I wouldn't say a minimum, but, like, pretty normal these days.
[1326.54 --> 1328.00]  For $154.
[1328.46 --> 1330.68]  And that's a nice WD Black drive.
[1330.68 --> 1332.74]  Like, there's a cheaper Samsung one right below it.
[1333.30 --> 1335.18]  And even that is a nice...
[1335.18 --> 1336.32]  Western version 1 is even cheaper!
[1336.54 --> 1337.74]  Brand name drive.
[1337.86 --> 1338.10]  Yeah!
[1338.60 --> 1340.32]  That is a $9.90 Evo.
[1340.46 --> 1342.00]  That is a really nice...
[1342.00 --> 1344.64]  I'm fairly certain for 2 terabytes you can get under $100.
[1344.86 --> 1346.00]  That's a nice SSD.
[1346.00 --> 1356.00]  So Apple is literally charging an order of magnitude more than commodity SSD pricing for a storage upgrade.
[1356.22 --> 1357.30]  Speaking of which...
[1357.30 --> 1357.72]  Oh, shoot!
[1357.76 --> 1359.32]  I forgot to have this added to the dock.
[1359.70 --> 1367.10]  But someone hacked together Apple SSD upgrade harness or something.
[1367.78 --> 1368.48]  Oh, no.
[1368.52 --> 1369.28]  I can't find it.
[1369.64 --> 1370.66]  I can't find it!
[1370.66 --> 1371.70]  Uh...
[1371.70 --> 1373.76]  If someone can find it, send it to me.
[1374.04 --> 1377.84]  But someone made a way to upgrade the SSDs in Macs.
[1378.14 --> 1379.76]  Like some hardware hacker.
[1380.28 --> 1380.60]  Um...
[1381.60 --> 1383.92]  And then things don't get much better.
[1383.92 --> 1387.80]  A mere 8 gigs of memory.
[1388.20 --> 1388.50]  Okay?
[1388.60 --> 1395.10]  So that appears to be the only upgrade going from the $800 configuration to the $1000 configuration.
[1395.56 --> 1397.34]  I get 8 more gigs of RAM.
[1397.52 --> 1401.16]  That will cost me another $200.
[1401.90 --> 1403.40]  So go into the manual...
[1403.40 --> 1404.12]  For context...
[1404.12 --> 1405.62]  For context...
[1405.62 --> 1407.40]  Here's 32 gigs...
[1407.40 --> 1409.52]  Of DDR5.
[1413.44 --> 1413.96]  Sorry.
[1414.22 --> 1414.48]  Sorry.
[1414.74 --> 1415.40]  For context...
[1416.10 --> 1418.40]  Here's 64 gigs...
[1418.40 --> 1420.34]  Of DDR5.
[1422.46 --> 1423.34]  Whoopsie doodles.
[1424.60 --> 1425.74]  For $200.
[1426.54 --> 1427.74]  So go into the...
[1427.74 --> 1429.12]  Apple just can't resist, Luke!
[1429.36 --> 1431.28]  We don't need to do 64 gigs.
[1431.40 --> 1432.18]  Let's not...
[1432.18 --> 1432.92]  Let's not...
[1432.92 --> 1434.28]  They can't resist, brother!
[1434.82 --> 1437.58]  But let's go to 32 gigs on the Apple configurator.
[1438.14 --> 1439.86]  And a 2 terabyte SSD.
[1440.04 --> 1440.86]  And how much does that cost?
[1440.88 --> 1441.10]  Alright.
[1441.26 --> 1441.50]  Alright.
[1441.58 --> 1442.52]  Let me start with my base.
[1442.56 --> 1444.00]  Let me start with my base configuration.
[1444.66 --> 1445.24]  So you're gonna make me...
[1445.24 --> 1446.86]  Because the business team would not accept...
[1446.86 --> 1448.18]  You're gonna make me go all the way to...
[1448.18 --> 1448.98]  Would not accept...
[1448.98 --> 1449.94]  16 gigs.
[1450.14 --> 1451.18]  And a 2 terabyte SSD.
[1451.42 --> 1452.84]  And I think a 2 terabyte SSD is fair.
[1452.90 --> 1454.14]  Just as a reminder, guys.
[1454.14 --> 1454.28]  Woo!
[1454.66 --> 1455.48]  Just as a reminder.
[1455.60 --> 1456.28]  Oh my gosh.
[1456.96 --> 1458.14]  We just spent...
[1458.14 --> 1458.58]  Okay?
[1458.64 --> 1459.46]  On Newegg...
[1459.46 --> 1461.36]  For 64 gigs of memory...
[1461.36 --> 1462.90]  And a 2 terabyte SSD.
[1462.90 --> 1465.76]  We just spent about...
[1465.76 --> 1467.36]  350 dollars.
[1469.62 --> 1472.64]  We went from a 600 dollar machine...
[1472.64 --> 1474.16]  Buying half as much memory.
[1475.06 --> 1476.72]  Half as much memory...
[1476.72 --> 1477.52]  And the same...
[1477.52 --> 1478.70]  And actually less storage.
[1478.84 --> 1479.82]  A slightly less storage.
[1479.90 --> 1481.48]  Because we had the 256 gig to start.
[1481.48 --> 1484.34]  We went from a 600 dollar machine...
[1484.34 --> 1488.62]  To an 1800 dollar computer.
[1492.36 --> 1493.34]  That's how they get you.
[1493.52 --> 1494.14]  That's a rip.
[1494.48 --> 1495.34]  That's a rip right there.
[1495.34 --> 1496.12]  That's how they get you.
[1496.56 --> 1498.62]  Apple gives you the first hit for cheap.
[1498.86 --> 1499.34]  Now I can just like...
[1499.34 --> 1501.02]  Get whatever I want.
[1501.52 --> 1501.84]  Yeah.
[1502.26 --> 1502.48]  Yeah.
[1502.52 --> 1504.74]  You can have whatever you like.
[1506.18 --> 1506.26]  Yeah.
[1506.56 --> 1507.30]  So...
[1507.30 --> 1509.08]  I think that our review...
[1509.08 --> 1511.08]  Of the M4 Mac Mini...
[1511.08 --> 1512.36]  Is going to be a little bit complicated.
[1512.76 --> 1514.20]  Because as a basic machine...
[1514.76 --> 1515.20]  That kind of does...
[1516.58 --> 1519.20]  98% of what...
[1519.20 --> 1520.56]  Any non-gamer...
[1520.56 --> 1521.56]  So we're talking non-gamers.
[1522.04 --> 1523.72]  It'll probably do 98%...
[1523.72 --> 1525.64]  Of what 90 plus percent...
[1525.64 --> 1526.84]  Of people would need.
[1527.22 --> 1528.98]  And it'll do it for a long time.
[1529.26 --> 1530.62]  Apple supports their products...
[1530.62 --> 1531.66]  With software...
[1531.66 --> 1533.66]  For a very long time.
[1533.74 --> 1535.22]  And that used to be a major strength...
[1535.22 --> 1536.62]  For the PC platform.
[1536.74 --> 1537.84]  But I feel like it's actually...
[1537.84 --> 1538.60]  Been a little less.
[1539.14 --> 1540.52]  Things have been a little bumpy.
[1540.88 --> 1542.42]  With trusted platform modules.
[1543.22 --> 1544.42]  With vulnerabilities...
[1544.42 --> 1546.08]  That are only getting patched...
[1546.08 --> 1547.48]  Back a couple of generations.
[1549.20 --> 1551.42]  You've got to give credit...
[1551.42 --> 1551.92]  To Apple.
[1552.10 --> 1553.44]  For the things that they do well.
[1554.06 --> 1555.50]  At that entry level price...
[1555.50 --> 1556.66]  This thing...
[1556.66 --> 1558.06]  Absolutely...
[1558.06 --> 1559.08]  Slaps.
[1559.70 --> 1562.46]  But as soon as you start tweaking anything...
[1562.46 --> 1563.30]  Luke's sitting over here...
[1563.30 --> 1565.66]  Building an $1800 computer right now.
[1565.72 --> 1565.92]  I guess.
[1566.14 --> 1566.38]  I'm having fun.
[1566.50 --> 1567.34]  Is that what you're working on?
[1567.38 --> 1567.56]  Okay.
[1567.60 --> 1568.06]  Well let's see...
[1568.06 --> 1569.56]  Let's see how you're doing over here.
[1569.56 --> 1571.76]  So I upgraded to a 7800X3D.
[1572.30 --> 1572.48]  Yeah.
[1572.70 --> 1575.24]  I upgraded to a 4070.
[1575.62 --> 1575.80]  Yeah.
[1575.92 --> 1577.22]  I haven't changed to like...
[1577.22 --> 1578.50]  The SSD or the RAM yet.
[1578.54 --> 1580.26]  But that honestly won't increase the price much.
[1580.28 --> 1580.54]  Okay.
[1580.54 --> 1585.36]  I think you owe Apple a motherboard with like some USB 4 ports or something.
[1585.44 --> 1585.54]  That's fair.
[1585.72 --> 1585.94]  Yeah.
[1586.08 --> 1586.76]  Let's do that.
[1586.78 --> 1589.54]  Like if we're going to be somewhat fair to Apple here.
[1589.82 --> 1589.98]  Yeah.
[1589.98 --> 1591.50]  I barely even really started.
[1591.78 --> 1591.96]  Yeah.
[1591.96 --> 1594.18]  People want to see like a 4070 or something like that.
[1594.22 --> 1595.58]  Like let's outperform this thing.
[1595.60 --> 1596.08]  It was a 4070.
[1596.12 --> 1596.56]  Oh did you?
[1596.66 --> 1596.76]  No.
[1596.84 --> 1596.96]  Yeah.
[1596.96 --> 1597.96]  That was a 4070 in there.
[1602.06 --> 1602.80]  Motherboard shopping.
[1604.04 --> 1604.74]  Oh boy.
[1604.98 --> 1605.12]  Yeah.
[1605.16 --> 1605.38]  That's fine.
[1605.40 --> 1605.90]  Just use filters.
[1607.12 --> 1607.94]  You got this.
[1607.94 --> 1609.96]  He's got this.
[1610.44 --> 1616.38]  Not to mention that you're going to have all the PC like DIY PC benefits of you know PCI
[1616.38 --> 1617.90]  express slots that you can expand.
[1618.04 --> 1622.26]  And if you go AM5 in particular which AMD has committed to support until I believe it's
[1622.26 --> 1623.10]  2027.
[1623.60 --> 1624.94]  You may...
[1624.94 --> 1627.46]  Oh sorry.
[1627.66 --> 1628.52]  I had something in my eye there.
[1628.78 --> 1632.70]  You may see future upgrades to the CPU that Luke has chosen.
[1632.70 --> 1637.82]  For example that might offer measurable performance improvements.
[1638.38 --> 1638.74]  Potentially.
[1640.02 --> 1640.42]  Allegedly.
[1642.62 --> 1643.30]  What you got there?
[1643.36 --> 1643.74]  Did you find a motherboard?
[1643.74 --> 1644.86]  I still need Thunderbolt right?
[1645.26 --> 1645.52]  No.
[1645.60 --> 1645.74]  No.
[1645.88 --> 1645.96]  No.
[1646.08 --> 1646.60]  We're not doing that?
[1646.62 --> 1649.34]  As long as you got USB 4 and you got a decent number of USB-C ports.
[1649.44 --> 1649.96]  I think we can allow it.
[1649.96 --> 1652.46]  It's actually pretty legit then in regards to features.
[1652.92 --> 1653.12]  Okay.
[1653.20 --> 1653.54]  All right.
[1653.70 --> 1653.90]  Cool.
[1654.70 --> 1655.02]  Cool.
[1655.06 --> 1655.58]  What else you got?
[1655.66 --> 1656.02]  You got...
[1656.02 --> 1657.36]  I could probably get a better cooler.
[1657.76 --> 1659.32]  You could probably get more RAM if you wanted.
[1659.40 --> 1660.60]  What are you even at for your price?
[1660.80 --> 1661.22]  Swamp these out.
[1662.58 --> 1662.94]  1360.
[1662.98 --> 1665.44]  You're at $1,350.
[1667.38 --> 1667.70]  Wow.
[1668.10 --> 1668.54]  Let's get...
[1668.54 --> 1668.68]  Yeah.
[1668.76 --> 1669.54]  32 gigs of RAM.
[1669.60 --> 1669.82]  Why not?
[1669.94 --> 1670.66]  That seems pretty good.
[1671.10 --> 1671.54]  All right.
[1671.64 --> 1672.94]  It's less than 100 bucks by the way.
[1672.94 --> 1674.64]  I think we've made our point on this topic.
[1674.74 --> 1675.46]  We can move on.
[1676.36 --> 1678.38]  I got a four terabyte drive just for fun.
[1679.96 --> 1681.38]  I'm still under your budget.
[1682.22 --> 1683.66]  You got to rub it in like that, hey?
[1683.76 --> 1684.02]  All right.
[1684.08 --> 1684.60]  I see how it is.
[1684.60 --> 1686.88]  I could get a sick Noctua cooler as well.
[1686.98 --> 1687.50]  I'll still be under budget.
[1687.50 --> 1687.68]  Yeah.
[1687.68 --> 1689.28]  Well, your computer's like huge.
[1689.56 --> 1690.84]  So the Mac mini is mini.
[1690.96 --> 1691.50]  It is big.
[1691.50 --> 1691.92]  So get wrecked.
[1692.02 --> 1692.26]  It is big.
[1692.26 --> 1692.40]  Yeah.
[1692.40 --> 1692.94]  Get wrecked.
[1693.06 --> 1693.32]  Get wrecked.
[1693.36 --> 1693.64]  I win.
[1694.10 --> 1695.94]  I declare victory for Team Apple.
[1696.94 --> 1698.88]  I unapologetically declare victory.
[1699.04 --> 1699.28]  All right.
[1699.30 --> 1700.26]  What do you want to talk about next?
[1701.78 --> 1702.58]  Plastic victory.
[1702.90 --> 1704.92]  Let's do some of these modder things.
[1705.22 --> 1707.74]  This was a really cool week for modifications.
[1707.94 --> 1709.22]  Do you want to do the car thing?
[1709.22 --> 1712.58]  Or do you want to do the Steam Deck framework?
[1712.82 --> 1713.06]  Yes.
[1713.58 --> 1714.00]  All right.
[1714.10 --> 1714.66]  Steam Deck framework.
[1714.66 --> 1716.48]  No, I wasn't answering your question.
[1716.58 --> 1716.76]  Okay.
[1716.82 --> 1717.06]  Whatever.
[1717.20 --> 1717.94]  You pick what you like.
[1718.06 --> 1718.52]  I picked one.
[1718.56 --> 1718.88]  Okay.
[1719.04 --> 1719.82]  The Beth Deck.
[1720.00 --> 1720.28]  Yeah.
[1720.76 --> 1721.80]  This thing is really cool.
[1721.88 --> 1722.60]  Do you want to go for it?
[1722.84 --> 1723.10]  No.
[1723.24 --> 1723.36]  No.
[1723.48 --> 1724.06]  Do it.
[1724.06 --> 1724.30]  Do it.
[1724.30 --> 1724.32]  Do it.
[1724.32 --> 1724.34]  All right.
[1724.34 --> 1725.68]  Modder Beth Lee.
[1726.06 --> 1726.30]  Lee?
[1727.18 --> 1727.76]  I'm going to go with Lee.
[1728.10 --> 1732.60]  Has designed her own gaming handheld built around a Framework 13 laptop mainboard.
[1732.78 --> 1736.36]  If she worked on textiles instead of technology, she could be Bethlehem.
[1736.36 --> 1740.76]  Ashley Hem.
[1741.80 --> 1742.24]  Wow.
[1743.60 --> 1744.04]  Wow.
[1744.26 --> 1744.68]  Okay.
[1744.82 --> 1745.26]  All right.
[1745.46 --> 1745.84]  Uh.
[1746.64 --> 1747.68]  You're not going to ding him?
[1748.72 --> 1749.36]  All right.
[1749.42 --> 1749.92]  There we go.
[1750.00 --> 1750.20]  Sorry.
[1750.20 --> 1750.94]  I'm still in shock.
[1751.32 --> 1751.64]  Yeah.
[1751.74 --> 1752.88]  That was intense.
[1753.20 --> 1753.40]  Yeah.
[1754.08 --> 1754.16]  Uh.
[1754.16 --> 1754.58]  Uh.
[1754.58 --> 1756.58]  Anyways.
[1756.76 --> 1757.40]  It's called the Beth Deck.
[1757.40 --> 1761.80]  I'm trying to show a picture, but we talked about this a little bit on the pre-show.
[1761.92 --> 1762.18]  Dude.
[1762.24 --> 1762.80]  It's so bad these days.
[1762.80 --> 1765.00]  How impossible it is to use the internet now.
[1765.10 --> 1765.18]  Okay.
[1765.18 --> 1766.14]  It looks so cool.
[1766.54 --> 1767.54]  Oh my goodness.
[1767.92 --> 1768.26]  Anyways.
[1768.62 --> 1773.44]  They posted 3D print files for the handheld case to printables and designed it as a
[1773.44 --> 1778.02]  part of an ongoing competition on the site to make a cool Framework mainboard case.
[1778.38 --> 1781.42]  Included with the files is a list of necessary parts in the description.
[1781.60 --> 1781.80]  What?
[1781.86 --> 1782.18]  No way.
[1782.22 --> 1782.76]  That's awesome.
[1783.30 --> 1783.54]  Uh.
[1783.54 --> 1786.88]  Like screws and an 8-inch 900p touchscreen.
[1787.44 --> 1790.88]  All the listed parts apparently cost around 200 bucks before shipping.
[1790.88 --> 1797.88]  But that doesn't include the Framework mainboard, the Framework battery, RAM, SSD, or a Wi-Fi
[1797.88 --> 1798.12]  card.
[1798.22 --> 1798.82]  Muzzle that up.
[1799.04 --> 1800.32]  You can get all that from Framework.
[1800.98 --> 1806.64]  The Beth Deck is entirely solderless except for the listed speakers, but they don't actually
[1806.64 --> 1810.62]  recommend them because they sound like ****.
[1812.46 --> 1813.48]  I pressed the button.
[1813.54 --> 1814.08]  I did the thing.
[1814.14 --> 1814.72]  I was a good boy.
[1814.72 --> 1815.16]  Um.
[1817.52 --> 1819.92]  And are too powerful for the small handheld.
[1819.92 --> 1825.02]  They claimed that the whole thing can be assembled in about 15 minutes and disassembled in less
[1825.02 --> 1825.72]  than two minutes.
[1826.10 --> 1826.32]  Uh.
[1826.32 --> 1827.66]  Or zero if you try hard enough.
[1827.94 --> 1828.20]  Uh.
[1828.20 --> 1831.28]  There are some issues with the design aside from the speaker.
[1831.52 --> 1833.58]  The left joystick is a little bit sticky apparently.
[1833.96 --> 1840.64]  The battery can overheat and the power button flies off and out the window during disassembly.
[1841.60 --> 1844.78]  Due to these quirks and the design's popularity, uh.
[1844.78 --> 1849.50]  They're releasing a 1.5 version on November 8th to fix the smaller problems.
[1849.50 --> 1853.98]  Beth is also designing a thinner and lighter 2.0 version, which will apparently feature
[1853.98 --> 1857.06]  a custom PCB for the controls and better speakers.
[1857.28 --> 1857.76]  Wow.
[1858.52 --> 1860.20]  Dude, this is so sick.
[1860.38 --> 1863.42]  It looks actually like really cool.
[1863.56 --> 1864.36]  Investment disclosure.
[1864.56 --> 1865.68]  I'm invested in Framework.
[1866.10 --> 1866.62]  Um.
[1867.46 --> 1868.52]  This is amazing.
[1868.52 --> 1868.72]  Something.
[1870.82 --> 1872.86]  Someone said try this for a short circuit video.
[1872.96 --> 1873.78]  That'd actually be kind of sick.
[1873.78 --> 1875.76]  I don't know if that's a short circuit video, but I.
[1875.76 --> 1876.38]  Well, they said it's.
[1876.54 --> 1877.62]  You make it in 20 minutes.
[1879.12 --> 1879.52]  Uh.
[1880.64 --> 1881.20]  I mean.
[1881.30 --> 1883.62]  The whole thing can be assembled in 15 minutes and it's solderless.
[1883.62 --> 1885.88]  I guess.
[1887.24 --> 1887.60]  Theoretically.
[1887.86 --> 1889.72]  That's a lot of prep for a short circuit video, though.
[1889.74 --> 1890.24]  That is true.
[1890.32 --> 1891.38]  Sourcing everything and all that.
[1891.54 --> 1896.12]  So, no promises that it would be short circuit, but I feel like I'd be kind of down to try it.
[1897.04 --> 1898.08]  Could be fun on an LTT.
[1898.32 --> 1898.66]  I don't know.
[1899.10 --> 1901.12]  The value proposition.
[1901.56 --> 1902.58]  Maybe not amazing.
[1902.66 --> 1903.44]  Not going to be great.
[1903.50 --> 1905.60]  But that's also potentially true for Frameworks.
[1905.80 --> 1906.02]  Yeah.
[1906.12 --> 1906.60]  No, no, no.
[1906.64 --> 1907.02]  Yeah, no.
[1907.02 --> 1908.54]  I'm not denying that again.
[1908.56 --> 1910.96]  This is kind of par for the course with highly repairable things sometimes.
[1912.28 --> 1912.54]  Okay.
[1912.54 --> 1913.52]  I think it's really awesome.
[1913.78 --> 1914.04]  All right.
[1914.04 --> 1914.76]  I think it's super cool.
[1914.86 --> 1915.48]  Great work, Beth.
[1916.28 --> 1916.82]  Keep it going.
[1916.92 --> 1920.66]  I love that they're, like, making a second revision and stuff.
[1920.78 --> 1921.06]  Yeah.
[1921.24 --> 1925.02]  Like, this is more interesting to me than just a Steam Deck.
[1925.32 --> 1925.70]  I don't know.
[1926.04 --> 1926.46]  Seems cool.
[1926.82 --> 1930.32]  I mean, to be clear, there's still great things about the Steam Deck.
[1930.40 --> 1930.72]  SteamOS.
[1930.92 --> 1931.58]  Oh, yeah.
[1931.82 --> 1932.54]  Freaking awesome.
[1932.72 --> 1934.80]  This obviously doesn't have trackpads.
[1935.68 --> 1938.34]  The audio is tuned really well on the Steam Deck.
[1938.34 --> 1943.76]  It uses, especially the new OLED one, uses a beautiful OLED display with HDR.
[1944.08 --> 1945.76]  Like, let's be very clear.
[1945.98 --> 1953.52]  This is not the thing to buy if you just want a smooth, seamless, portable gaming experience.
[1953.62 --> 1955.24]  But say you're in the Framework ecosystem.
[1955.58 --> 1955.90]  Sure.
[1955.90 --> 1956.82]  You're upgrading your laptop.
[1957.20 --> 1957.54]  Sure.
[1957.54 --> 1960.74]  This is a pretty legit thing to do with your old motherboard.
[1960.96 --> 1962.20]  That's so sick.
[1962.30 --> 1964.80]  Compared to what most old laptops get used for.
[1965.00 --> 1965.14]  Yeah.
[1965.36 --> 1972.20]  Like, either nothing or a very small, uncool task.
[1972.24 --> 1976.50]  Dude, the number of, like, tech upgrade videos that we've done or off-site shoots that we've
[1976.50 --> 1981.86]  done in people's homes, basically, where their old tech is just...
[1981.86 --> 1982.44]  Abandoned.
[1982.58 --> 1983.88]  In a bag somewhere.
[1983.94 --> 1984.10]  Yeah.
[1984.20 --> 1985.74]  Or behind a shelf somewhere or whatever else.
[1985.74 --> 1987.56]  What if you could turn it into a handheld gaming machine?
[1987.62 --> 1989.20]  What if you could take it with you on the go?
[1989.30 --> 1989.98]  So sick.
[1990.10 --> 1990.68]  Very cool.
[1991.36 --> 1992.30]  Do we want to talk about the other one?
[1992.78 --> 1993.10]  Sure.
[1993.30 --> 1993.98]  Yeah, let's do that.
[1994.08 --> 1995.68]  It's near the bottom of the dock, I think.
[1995.74 --> 1997.16]  Yeah, it's right above the sponsors.
[1998.02 --> 2000.32]  Spotify's car thing has...
[2000.32 --> 2001.16]  I would say...
[2001.16 --> 2002.08]  I watched this whole video.
[2002.20 --> 2003.08]  It was actually really good.
[2003.40 --> 2005.30]  I would say it's straight up saved.
[2005.30 --> 2007.20]  It says, is saved?
[2007.20 --> 2007.94]  On the dock.
[2008.00 --> 2010.02]  But, like, no, this is actually amazing.
[2010.60 --> 2016.34]  YouTuber Dammit Jeff released a video this week discussing custom firmware for Spotify's
[2016.34 --> 2018.12]  car thing, a $90 device.
[2018.56 --> 2021.72]  The music streaming company will be remotely bricking in two months.
[2022.02 --> 2023.44]  By the way, f*** that.
[2023.64 --> 2024.60]  That's really stupid.
[2024.66 --> 2025.22]  Yeah, not cool.
[2025.40 --> 2032.26]  So before then, there's Desk Thing, a firmware that has its own companion app for your PC
[2032.26 --> 2035.82]  and that also has an app store for your car thing.
[2035.90 --> 2036.64]  That is so cool.
[2036.64 --> 2041.40]  There's Glance Thing, which, in addition, is still controlling Spotify playback.
[2041.94 --> 2047.88]  It allows you to add shortcuts to launch apps on your PC, similar to something like a Stream Deck.
[2048.02 --> 2048.70]  That's super cool.
[2048.70 --> 2053.56]  And then there's Nocturne, which isn't officially out yet and is the only firmware that managed
[2053.56 --> 2056.64]  to get the car thing's original features working, which is pretty cool.
[2057.12 --> 2062.92]  For now, it requires a host device for networking capabilities and whatnot.
[2063.04 --> 2064.50]  There's also other things you can do with it as well.
[2064.76 --> 2069.24]  Apparently, modders have determined car thing will still be moddable after the brick date
[2069.24 --> 2070.40]  as well, which is cool.
[2071.14 --> 2075.18]  And honestly, I would really just highly recommend watching the video.
[2075.36 --> 2079.18]  It's actually just really cool what they've done with it.
[2081.12 --> 2085.92]  Jeff, or Dammit Jeff, also goes over, as you can see, yeah, really cool ways to mount it
[2085.92 --> 2088.00]  and like 3D printed little things.
[2088.24 --> 2092.82]  Like he has two different ways that you can just mount it so it sits on your desk.
[2092.94 --> 2095.88]  And then there's that one where it's actually magnetically held there.
[2096.16 --> 2097.22]  That is so cool.
[2097.22 --> 2100.44]  So it's held under his monitor, but you can just pull it off and move it somewhere else.
[2100.54 --> 2101.16]  Really cool.
[2101.86 --> 2103.52]  I think it's magnetically held at least.
[2104.10 --> 2106.18]  But yeah, really awesome.
[2106.42 --> 2107.06]  Come on, darn it.
[2107.08 --> 2107.96]  Very cool video.
[2108.64 --> 2110.50]  The preview doesn't show you.
[2110.92 --> 2115.96]  See, if I click a preview, my expectation is that it will take me to a frame that shows that.
[2116.66 --> 2116.92]  Yeah.
[2117.96 --> 2120.66]  Anyway, the point is, you guys should watch the video anyway.
[2120.66 --> 2123.58]  Don't look at us looking at the video.
[2123.70 --> 2124.90]  Look at the video for yourself.
[2125.22 --> 2126.06]  Fantastic video.
[2126.06 --> 2127.18]  Really cool project.
[2127.48 --> 2131.48]  I thought it was so cool that I was like, hey, maybe I actually want one of these things.
[2131.58 --> 2132.44]  And then you went on eBay.
[2132.84 --> 2133.12]  Yeah.
[2133.30 --> 2134.86]  And found out that...
[2134.86 --> 2137.60]  They're like over twice as much as they originally were.
[2138.36 --> 2138.72]  What?
[2139.64 --> 2141.50]  Like our notes are like $90 device.
[2141.58 --> 2142.32]  Because it was.
[2142.60 --> 2144.02]  It was a $90 device.
[2144.24 --> 2146.44]  It is no longer a $90 device.
[2146.58 --> 2147.54]  Hot option.
[2147.78 --> 2149.06]  It's now like a $300 device.
[2149.06 --> 2152.18]  Spotify had no idea what they had.
[2152.24 --> 2152.98]  What the heck, dude?
[2152.98 --> 2154.70]  They didn't know what they had.
[2155.96 --> 2156.96]  Damn it, Jeff.
[2158.76 --> 2159.78]  Oh, man.
[2160.56 --> 2162.72]  His username could not be more perfect.
[2162.98 --> 2163.36]  Yeah.
[2164.04 --> 2167.38]  Yeah, this is why we can't have nice broken things, Jeff.
[2167.38 --> 2170.16]  You're fixing CPUs and motherboards.
[2170.28 --> 2171.74]  He's fixing car things.
[2171.84 --> 2172.88]  Typical Jeffs.
[2172.90 --> 2173.92]  It's all ruined.
[2174.50 --> 2176.44]  Way to go, Jeffs.
[2176.50 --> 2177.60]  As a group, I just...
[2177.60 --> 2178.62]  I don't condone you.
[2179.08 --> 2180.44]  I can't condone you.
[2181.44 --> 2182.22]  Damn it, Jeff.
[2183.50 --> 2185.12]  But yeah, super, super cool.
[2185.36 --> 2187.06]  All the Jeffs in chat apologizing.
[2187.16 --> 2187.66]  You should.
[2187.66 --> 2192.08]  Literally mid-video, I paused it, opened up eBay, and was like car thing.
[2192.24 --> 2195.44]  And I opened up eBay Canada and looked up car thing.
[2195.52 --> 2198.06]  And I was like, oh, they're just trying to scam people that don't know.
[2198.20 --> 2199.50]  I'll go to the American one.
[2199.56 --> 2200.50]  And it was just worse.
[2200.64 --> 2201.60]  I was like, what?
[2202.12 --> 2202.44]  Yep.
[2204.24 --> 2205.34]  Oh, man.
[2207.68 --> 2208.36]  Oh, well.
[2210.02 --> 2213.62]  Anywho, it's time for us to explain merch messages.
[2213.62 --> 2217.76]  Yeah, we don't do super chats.
[2217.86 --> 2218.88]  We don't do Twitch bits.
[2219.00 --> 2224.96]  We do merch messages because of a combination of features on other platforms not actually
[2224.96 --> 2225.90]  working correctly.
[2226.14 --> 2228.40]  And also, we just think it's playing better.
[2228.52 --> 2232.80]  If you want to interact with the show, hey, why not throw money at your screen?
[2233.32 --> 2238.72]  And, you know, maybe producer Dan replies to you in the bottom here or just post your message
[2238.72 --> 2239.74]  if you have a shout out.
[2239.92 --> 2243.06]  Or maybe he forwards it to someone internally to get back to you.
[2243.62 --> 2245.82]  What?
[2248.66 --> 2249.06]  Alright.
[2249.64 --> 2250.74]  I don't know.
[2252.42 --> 2252.86]  Oh.
[2255.12 --> 2257.80]  Or maybe he curates it and Luke and I respond.
[2258.08 --> 2263.24]  No matter what does or doesn't happen to your merch message, you will at least get your order
[2263.24 --> 2263.80]  in the mail.
[2263.90 --> 2270.40]  We've got all kinds of great stuff on LTTstore.com, including an exciting new product launch.
[2270.60 --> 2271.56]  That's right, my friends.
[2271.56 --> 2272.06]  It's here.
[2272.06 --> 2272.80]  The one.
[2272.96 --> 2273.60]  No, not that.
[2273.82 --> 2274.40]  The one.
[2274.72 --> 2275.38]  The only.
[2278.50 --> 2280.86]  Wensho Corkboard.
[2281.80 --> 2282.20]  Wow.
[2282.98 --> 2283.76]  Does it go with the pins?
[2284.12 --> 2284.36]  No.
[2284.70 --> 2284.88]  Oh.
[2285.02 --> 2285.88]  You have to get your own pins.
[2286.08 --> 2286.24]  Oh.
[2286.24 --> 2287.92]  But we've had lots of pins.
[2288.20 --> 2289.40]  I asked the team.
[2289.44 --> 2292.18]  I was like, do we have any new pins to announce with it?
[2292.32 --> 2293.60]  And they were like, nope.
[2294.42 --> 2297.00]  And I was like, oh, you could mount your pins there.
[2299.56 --> 2300.20]  That's cool.
[2300.94 --> 2302.80]  Are you for real right now?
[2302.80 --> 2308.28]  I mean, I don't have cork boards or am I a pin collector, so I didn't really put it together.
[2308.46 --> 2310.48]  But I didn't put together putting LTTstore pins.
[2310.56 --> 2311.40]  You are for real right now.
[2311.40 --> 2311.86]  No, no, no.
[2311.90 --> 2312.64]  Look, look, look, look.
[2312.72 --> 2314.62]  On the store, they don't use it that way.
[2315.24 --> 2316.80]  I mean, yeah, I guess.
[2316.94 --> 2318.46]  I mean, you could scroll down a little.
[2318.98 --> 2320.22]  Do they end up using it that way?
[2320.68 --> 2320.92]  No.
[2322.14 --> 2322.40]  No.
[2322.40 --> 2326.04]  No, there's no examples of this.
[2326.10 --> 2327.44]  Wait, shut up.
[2327.62 --> 2328.02]  No.
[2328.38 --> 2329.14]  Keep scrolling.
[2329.92 --> 2330.90]  Are there not more pictures?
[2330.90 --> 2331.28]  That's all.
[2331.38 --> 2332.08]  This is the last one.
[2332.08 --> 2332.38]  That's it?
[2332.46 --> 2334.56]  We didn't put any LTT pins on it in the pictures?
[2334.84 --> 2335.04]  No.
[2335.60 --> 2335.84]  Oh.
[2336.58 --> 2336.92]  Um.
[2338.10 --> 2338.50]  Well.
[2340.56 --> 2342.88]  We've definitely done pin collections in the past.
[2342.94 --> 2344.58]  It's also not in the related products.
[2344.98 --> 2350.86]  The inspiration for doing this was definitely for people to be able to put their LTT pins on them.
[2350.86 --> 2354.16]  Well, maybe we can put a picture of that somewhere.
[2354.36 --> 2359.56]  Because I looked at this picture and I was like, oh, yeah, that's neat.
[2359.70 --> 2360.46]  Pins not included.
[2360.58 --> 2363.18]  This is how I've used these types of things in the past.
[2363.54 --> 2366.00]  But I didn't think about it being like a collection thing.
[2366.28 --> 2367.40]  I forgot we sold things.
[2367.40 --> 2368.36]  Like a Thanos glove for.
[2368.36 --> 2369.04]  I blame Colton.
[2369.54 --> 2371.68]  A Thanos glove for LTTstore pins.
[2371.84 --> 2372.48]  Already oof.
[2372.90 --> 2373.28]  Anyway.
[2374.00 --> 2374.76]  Nothing shows.
[2374.86 --> 2375.60]  I'll read the thing.
[2375.66 --> 2376.24]  I'll read the thing.
[2376.24 --> 2379.98]  Nothing shows your passion for tech more than a snazzy new corkboard that lets people know
[2379.98 --> 2382.80]  you watch two big nerds talk about it for hours every week.
[2383.24 --> 2386.48]  It comes with six push pins, which are already inserted into the side.
[2386.62 --> 2392.22]  And it is super easy to hang on your wall thanks to its two keyhole slots on the back,
[2392.36 --> 2397.16]  which conveniently we have put magnetic cable management power bar holders into
[2397.16 --> 2399.52]  because they will definitely work for that.
[2399.58 --> 2400.94]  But anyway, two little keyhole slots.
[2401.04 --> 2402.68]  You can just throw a couple nails or screws in the wall.
[2402.68 --> 2407.00]  Or you can use these and you can magnetically mount it, which would be super cool.
[2407.50 --> 2408.52]  What else we got to talk?
[2408.62 --> 2412.32]  It's one power bar key is already attached.
[2413.14 --> 2416.90]  Available now at lmg.gg slash corkboard.
[2417.12 --> 2419.74]  We've got a couple of other announcements.
[2420.72 --> 2422.44]  Flowplane November update.
[2423.04 --> 2426.06]  We have a packed November for our Flowplane members.
[2426.18 --> 2430.92]  For starters, we'll be dropping a new Why Is WAN Late episode next Friday.
[2430.92 --> 2436.10]  It's a monthly behind the scenes of Linus and Luke's time after 4.30pm every Friday.
[2436.30 --> 2440.76]  We will also have a new person week airing mid-late month.
[2440.92 --> 2443.32]  It's going to be Elijah week!
[2443.84 --> 2446.12]  Don't expect any backflips though.
[2446.24 --> 2448.06]  I have personally forbaden it.
[2448.58 --> 2449.80]  It is forbaded.
[2450.60 --> 2455.60]  Finally, we're asking our subscribers to send in questions for any Vaughn Q&A.
[2455.72 --> 2456.68]  This says please click.
[2456.84 --> 2458.14]  They should just do an Yvonne week.
[2459.46 --> 2459.94]  Here.
[2460.92 --> 2462.34]  This is such a terrible picture of Yvonne.
[2464.22 --> 2465.00]  Hi floaties.
[2465.10 --> 2466.76]  We're planning on shooting an Yvonne Q&A.
[2466.86 --> 2467.62]  Leave your questions below.
[2467.70 --> 2468.36]  They may get answered.
[2468.48 --> 2469.14]  Good lord.
[2469.22 --> 2470.16]  That is a lot of questions.
[2472.66 --> 2473.56]  It's been amazing.
[2473.94 --> 2477.92]  Remember we talked about that concept, Luke, of having like a hater wall?
[2477.92 --> 2482.86]  Posting like comments about how float plane will never work and will always fail and whatever else.
[2482.86 --> 2488.38]  And like using it as inspiration for, you know, yeah.
[2488.78 --> 2489.96]  Flow plane is definitely a thing.
[2490.02 --> 2491.78]  It's actually a great community.
[2492.02 --> 2496.40]  The comments and the interaction under the videos is like super positive most of the time.
[2496.40 --> 2499.42]  I mean, anytime people are passionate about things.
[2499.62 --> 2501.30]  Sometimes things can get a little bit heated.
[2501.30 --> 2503.46]  But it's a great.
[2503.58 --> 2504.48]  In general, it's pretty good though.
[2504.64 --> 2505.72]  It's a great community.
[2506.06 --> 2508.80]  And we've got a great month coming up for you guys.
[2509.56 --> 2514.80]  And all you got to do is go to lmg.gg slash float plane to get subscribed.
[2514.80 --> 2519.44]  And you can submit questions for Sammy to go through and select.
[2519.90 --> 2520.84]  What else we got?
[2520.92 --> 2521.60]  Oh, okay.
[2521.78 --> 2528.00]  The last announcement before we do a couple of merch messages is our ex-partner anchor is once again.
[2528.44 --> 2528.88]  Just.
[2529.76 --> 2530.48]  Oh, wait.
[2530.82 --> 2531.06]  Sorry.
[2531.12 --> 2532.14]  This post was deleted.
[2534.06 --> 2534.86]  Oh, okay.
[2534.90 --> 2535.80]  Well, why'd they delete it?
[2536.66 --> 2537.34]  That's weird.
[2537.48 --> 2537.88]  I don't know.
[2538.40 --> 2538.84]  Apparently.
[2539.52 --> 2540.14]  Hold on.
[2542.44 --> 2544.64]  Someone says, no, it doesn't list me there.
[2545.18 --> 2546.90]  So maybe they finally removed it for real?
[2550.40 --> 2550.80]  Yeah.
[2550.88 --> 2553.06]  I don't think it was in this slidey thing.
[2556.22 --> 2556.80]  I'm going.
[2556.96 --> 2557.18]  I'm going.
[2559.00 --> 2560.38]  It was here.
[2560.58 --> 2561.30]  That 19.
[2561.30 --> 2563.40]  It used to be next to the dot com.
[2563.78 --> 2563.98]  Okay.
[2564.18 --> 2564.44]  All right.
[2564.48 --> 2566.02]  So it probably got deleted because they updated it.
[2566.04 --> 2566.76]  Maybe we're clear then.
[2566.84 --> 2567.00]  Okay.
[2567.12 --> 2569.38]  Well, anyway.
[2569.54 --> 2569.76]  Okay.
[2569.76 --> 2569.98]  Good.
[2570.12 --> 2570.74]  Well, that's good then.
[2571.96 --> 2572.54]  All right.
[2572.70 --> 2573.84]  Why don't we do a couple of merch messages?
[2574.34 --> 2574.50]  Sure.
[2574.80 --> 2575.12]  Hit me.
[2575.72 --> 2576.40]  Hey, guys.
[2576.62 --> 2580.30]  Linus, have you seen the trailers for Claire Obscure Expedition 33?
[2580.48 --> 2580.96]  What now?
[2581.20 --> 2584.60]  As a fellow turn-based JRPG fan, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[2584.66 --> 2585.58]  I'm super excited for it.
[2586.36 --> 2589.82]  Claire Obscure Expedition 33.
[2589.82 --> 2591.64]  That's not even...
[2591.64 --> 2592.00]  What a name.
[2592.00 --> 2594.18]  That's not on my radar at all yet.
[2594.82 --> 2595.74]  What is this?
[2596.42 --> 2597.14]  I don't know.
[2597.18 --> 2598.48]  It's coming in next year.
[2599.52 --> 2599.92]  Okay.
[2600.02 --> 2600.54]  From who?
[2603.60 --> 2604.00]  Interesting.
[2604.64 --> 2605.66]  Multi-platform release.
[2605.72 --> 2607.10]  That's always nice to see.
[2609.84 --> 2611.24]  Cast reveal trailer?
[2611.24 --> 2616.06]  I mean, it definitely has a vibe so far.
[2616.24 --> 2619.64]  But no, this is the first that I'm hearing of it.
[2619.76 --> 2623.60]  So this might have to be something that I'll have to throw on my list.
[2625.66 --> 2626.98]  Reactive turn-based combat?
[2628.98 --> 2629.98]  Dodge, parry, and counter.
[2630.06 --> 2630.32]  Okay.
[2630.32 --> 2633.74]  Yeah, I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad.
[2633.82 --> 2635.84]  I mean, Super Mario RPG has kind of reacted.
[2635.84 --> 2640.82]  No, the reason why I reacted that way is when people say what the combat is and they don't show it, I always get suspicious.
[2641.20 --> 2643.04]  I mean, it seems like it's pretty early.
[2644.16 --> 2648.66]  It's made by Sandfall Interactive.
[2649.14 --> 2649.50]  Sandfall?
[2649.58 --> 2650.22]  What are they known for?
[2650.22 --> 2652.02]  Publisher Kepler Interactive?
[2652.86 --> 2654.82]  I have no idea.
[2655.88 --> 2657.38]  Sandfall Interactive.
[2657.38 --> 2660.66]  Games list.
[2661.06 --> 2662.42]  What have you guys done before?
[2663.54 --> 2666.16]  I think this might be the first one.
[2666.30 --> 2667.56]  Oh, good luck, everyone.
[2669.00 --> 2669.24]  Yeah.
[2671.62 --> 2673.84]  CTO comes from Ubisoft.
[2676.80 --> 2679.22]  CEO comes from Ubisoft.
[2679.22 --> 2680.80]  This is an Ubisoft splinter company.
[2681.46 --> 2681.82]  Oh, okay.
[2681.82 --> 2686.36]  As in people from Ubisoft left and made this.
[2686.36 --> 2688.28]  Not, it is an Ubisoft company.
[2688.52 --> 2692.24]  Well, hopefully they're the good people from Ubisoft because they had to have gone somewhere.
[2692.46 --> 2696.16]  My way too short video that I made was about how this is happening a lot now.
[2696.30 --> 2696.52]  Yeah.
[2696.98 --> 2697.46]  So.
[2697.70 --> 2704.22]  And I mean, there is obviously a period of pain right now in the games industry.
[2704.54 --> 2704.78]  Oh, yeah.
[2704.78 --> 2708.24]  But what I hope is that projects like this.
[2708.32 --> 2708.56]  Totally.
[2708.56 --> 2717.92]  Companies like this are wildly successful and we see kind of the growth that comes after
[2717.92 --> 2719.24]  the volcano, you know?
[2719.24 --> 2727.74]  And to be clear, the people that are suffering in the layoffs and the upheaval, it's not fun
[2727.74 --> 2728.50]  for anyone.
[2728.90 --> 2729.84]  It's terrible.
[2730.18 --> 2738.70]  But if there was a good outcome that could happen, stuff like this and the success of
[2738.70 --> 2740.04]  stuff like this would be it.
[2740.04 --> 2743.68]  Yeah, I recognize the CEO's name.
[2744.32 --> 2747.44]  So I'm trying to look up what they've done.
[2750.18 --> 2752.26]  And my Google foo is failing right now.
[2752.32 --> 2753.88]  But I recognize the CEO's name.
[2754.74 --> 2756.34]  And yeah, I mean, I hope it does well.
[2756.64 --> 2762.42]  I am hoping for basically any of these companies where people split off from one of these big
[2762.42 --> 2765.96]  developers that are failing pretty hard right now and they try to make something themselves.
[2766.12 --> 2767.92]  I have big hopes for all of them.
[2767.92 --> 2769.46]  So I hope this one works out as well.
[2771.58 --> 2771.98]  Yeah.
[2773.98 --> 2774.66]  All right.
[2775.14 --> 2775.60]  One more.
[2775.82 --> 2776.42]  Hit me, Dan.
[2776.60 --> 2776.86]  Sure.
[2777.80 --> 2779.46]  Third time buyer, first time messenger.
[2779.86 --> 2783.68]  Did you see Jeff Geerling's video on the LDT Precision screwdriver?
[2784.02 --> 2785.52]  And how well did you enjoy it?
[2785.98 --> 2787.50]  I did see his video.
[2787.86 --> 2788.38]  Did you watch it?
[2789.04 --> 2791.58]  I watched pieces of it.
[2791.90 --> 2795.30]  Like I watched the sections that I thought were most relevant.
[2795.30 --> 2797.72]  I didn't watch like the fidget spinner bit.
[2797.92 --> 2799.04]  Fair enough.
[2799.28 --> 2800.40]  It seemed pretty long.
[2801.34 --> 2802.56]  I think he's just having fun with it.
[2802.60 --> 2803.14]  But yeah, I agree.
[2803.64 --> 2804.60]  I think that.
[2806.66 --> 2808.38]  How do I put this?
[2809.38 --> 2813.50]  I think that it's ultimately up to every individual user.
[2813.50 --> 2817.66]  What features of a product benefit them the most?
[2819.66 --> 2830.10]  I didn't really fully understand some of the preferences.
[2830.10 --> 2843.26]  Like as someone who has worked on small electronics a fair bit over the years, be they laptops or phones or game consoles or controllers or whatever the case may be.
[2843.26 --> 2849.86]  You know, I don't see a clear benefit to having a longer hex portion of the bit.
[2849.86 --> 2856.86]  Whereas I do see a very clear benefit to having a longer blade portion of the bit.
[2856.86 --> 2866.86]  Because it happens so often that plastic housings will leave a screw deeply recessed.
[2867.38 --> 2880.94]  And having a longer blade for me means I'll be reaching for the dedicated precision fixed drivers a lot less often than I otherwise would have to.
[2880.94 --> 2887.94]  I was a little confused that more...
[2889.94 --> 2890.94]  Hmm.
[2894.16 --> 2897.64]  Well, he compared it against their plastic one when they have a metal one, right?
[2897.84 --> 2898.18]  Yeah.
[2898.24 --> 2899.64]  That was the main thing that stood out to me.
[2899.82 --> 2901.00]  I don't...
[2901.00 --> 2901.54]  Yeah.
[2901.96 --> 2902.38]  Yes.
[2902.38 --> 2903.38]  Um...
[2903.38 --> 2908.28]  And their metal one doesn't have the bit storage.
[2908.38 --> 2911.44]  So I think he might have gone from a feature standpoint.
[2911.60 --> 2916.38]  So he went bit storage against bit storage instead of metal driver, metal premium driver versus metal premium driver.
[2916.80 --> 2917.86]  I don't know.
[2918.58 --> 2925.82]  Um, something that, you know, like to me as someone who has used a precision screwdriver a lot,
[2925.82 --> 2937.16]  something that would have been apparent to me very, um, immediately about our driver is the superior magnetic strength compared to other precision drivers.
[2937.54 --> 2941.82]  It's one of those little things that we don't cheap out on that, um...
[2941.82 --> 2948.16]  Or I shouldn't even say don't cheap out on because having a magnet at all means you didn't cheap out on the design in my opinion.
[2948.16 --> 2955.98]  Um, but that we, we spent extra time and we spent extra money to, to ensure that it was a really good experience.
[2956.58 --> 2968.58]  Um, it's one of those things that we do that should be, again, um, pretty immediately apparent, but, uh, didn't really seem to draw much attention.
[2969.28 --> 2970.74]  So, I don't know.
[2971.08 --> 2977.82]  I mean, look, the reality of it is, obviously, I think our product is great, or I never would have greenlit the release of it.
[2978.16 --> 2993.38]  Um, so, you can't really take my opinion, um, and as I always say, um, you know, you should get multiple, uh, you should get, you should take multiple opinions anytime you're looking to buy a product.
[2993.50 --> 3008.14]  So, whether it's reviews on our site, or whether it's, you know, other creators that we sent creator editions out to, you know, all we ask for is the possibility that they will maybe consider talking about it, um, with their own authentic voice.
[3008.16 --> 3010.28]  And their own honest opinions.
[3011.24 --> 3018.82]  Um, and so, yeah, you know, that, what that means is that every once in a while, we're going to send out a driver and someone's going to like it a lot.
[3018.82 --> 3028.68]  And, um, and you know, that's, that's, uh, that's how it works.
[3028.82 --> 3033.52]  So, as far as my understanding goes, the, the cheaper one that has bit storage, the cap doesn't spin.
[3033.68 --> 3035.02]  So, you don't have that palm turn.
[3035.14 --> 3036.92]  I think it spins a little, but not much.
[3036.92 --> 3037.90]  Like, not, not well.
[3038.06 --> 3039.62]  I haven't used it directly, so I don't know.
[3039.70 --> 3039.84]  Yeah.
[3040.20 --> 3040.80]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3040.80 --> 3042.30]  It's, uh, it's interesting.
[3048.24 --> 3048.94]  Uh, all right.
[3048.94 --> 3049.90]  What are we doing next?
[3050.28 --> 3054.96]  The comments on that video are, are pretty intense.
[3054.96 --> 3056.32]  I have no comment on the comments.
[3056.58 --> 3056.86]  Um.
[3056.94 --> 3057.66]  Have you read the comments?
[3058.06 --> 3062.32]  U.S. judges are using algorithmic tools just kind of whenever they feel like it.
[3062.32 --> 3067.82]  Uh, original article here is from The Verge and both it and actually speaking of comments,
[3068.18 --> 3074.26]  uh, the comment section on that video, or excuse me, on that article are worth having
[3074.26 --> 3079.38]  a look at because there's kind of an interesting debate and what side of the debate you land
[3079.38 --> 3082.48]  on, I guess, you know, can be up to you to kind of see how you feel about it.
[3082.48 --> 3084.20]  But I think it's really worth a read.
[3084.56 --> 3089.42]  Um, Dan, if you don't mind throwing the link to The Verge article into the, uh, into the various
[3089.42 --> 3089.76]  chats.
[3089.88 --> 3090.92]  I'd appreciate that very much.
[3090.96 --> 3091.16]  Thank you.
[3091.18 --> 3091.38]  Thank you.
[3091.38 --> 3091.60]  Thank you.
[3091.60 --> 3092.52]  Thank you, dude.
[3092.52 --> 3092.74]  Thank you, dude.
[3092.74 --> 3094.92]  But here's kind of the, here's kind of the gist of it.
[3094.96 --> 3103.00]  Um, and, and always time strapped court system in the U S is increasingly turning to risk
[3103.00 --> 3108.72]  assessment algorithms as a way of guiding a judge's decision for whether to grant bail.
[3109.18 --> 3116.32]  So a bailiff, a bailiff inputs the file information and then the algorithm checks a vast database
[3116.32 --> 3124.54]  of past cases and assigns a score, low, medium, or high, or a number on a scale.
[3124.54 --> 3136.06]  And this system basically is supposed to algorithmically suggest what the risk of re-offense might be.
[3136.52 --> 3141.82]  These systems are intended to reduce the impact of personal bias from a judge,
[3141.82 --> 3146.88]  but there's a lot of questions about how well that's actually working.
[3147.22 --> 3156.30]  A recent study published in Social Problems found that judges report accepting or refusing the advice of these algorithmic tools
[3156.30 --> 3162.88]  selectively for their own human, potentially biased reasons.
[3163.92 --> 3169.20]  Judges reported using these tools to quickly process lower-stakes cases,
[3169.20 --> 3172.38]  even when they weren't confident in the output that was provided.
[3172.38 --> 3177.16]  So basically it's an algorithmic armor, you know?
[3177.28 --> 3183.30]  It's like a shield against making a bad judgment call by just kind of going,
[3183.42 --> 3184.82]  oh, well, the algorithm said.
[3185.08 --> 3187.84]  Imagine your algorithmic armor had LTT pins on it.
[3188.00 --> 3194.70]  However, they also admitted that they were leery of accepting low scores
[3194.70 --> 3198.96]  in cases of domestic violence, for example, or other more intimate crimes
[3198.96 --> 3202.96]  due to not trusting the weighing of the algorithm
[3202.96 --> 3205.80]  and also due to concern over their own reputations.
[3205.80 --> 3212.80]  To be clear, I 100% agree that in a case of an intimate crime or domestic violence,
[3212.80 --> 3216.96]  they should be erring on the side of high risk of re-offense,
[3216.96 --> 3220.62]  not necessarily because the risk of re-offense is necessarily higher,
[3220.80 --> 3225.82]  but because the stakes are so high.
[3225.90 --> 3231.60]  If the risk of re-offense for shoplifting a pack of gum is high,
[3232.74 --> 3235.08]  that, I don't care.
[3235.64 --> 3238.80]  Whereas if the risk of re-offense of, you know,
[3239.16 --> 3242.90]  assault with a deadly weapon against your spouse is low,
[3242.90 --> 3244.92]  vehicular man's law.
[3244.92 --> 3249.16]  I'll take a 99% risk of re-offense for the gum
[3249.16 --> 3253.50]  over a 3% risk of re-offense for spousal assault.
[3253.92 --> 3255.08]  You know, like I get it.
[3255.30 --> 3258.12]  I just mean you don't get to selectively decide
[3258.12 --> 3261.76]  if the algorithm works or not based on your own feeling in the moment
[3261.76 --> 3266.58]  because that's basically just your own feeling in the moment with extra steps.
[3266.58 --> 3272.06]  The judges reported using the apparent authority of these systems
[3272.06 --> 3275.22]  to defend unpopular decisions as well.
[3276.38 --> 3279.50]  All in all, the judges were using their own moral views as a ruler
[3279.50 --> 3282.60]  to determine whether or not the algorithm was legitimate
[3282.60 --> 3287.56]  and would shift how they felt about it from case to case.
[3291.10 --> 3294.70]  Other studies have raised questions about how accurate this system is
[3294.70 --> 3296.72]  at predicting whether a given prisoner will re-offend
[3296.72 --> 3300.06]  because they have found garbage in, garbage out problems
[3300.06 --> 3303.48]  where biased training data would cause certain demographics
[3303.48 --> 3305.28]  to be rated as more likely to re-offend
[3305.28 --> 3307.98]  even when the individual in question doesn't have
[3307.98 --> 3309.68]  a significant past criminal history.
[3309.86 --> 3311.04]  The demographics are included?
[3311.80 --> 3313.44]  In theory, no.
[3313.54 --> 3315.86]  But the problem with any algorithmic system,
[3316.70 --> 3320.54]  AI included, is that if you tell it,
[3320.54 --> 3324.50]  hey, you can't factor in race, for example,
[3324.70 --> 3329.48]  it will find proxies like the area you live
[3329.48 --> 3331.44]  or your income.
[3334.80 --> 3335.36]  Yeah.
[3338.94 --> 3341.34]  So, dystopia.
[3341.98 --> 3342.32]  Yeah.
[3344.82 --> 3345.34]  Dystopiocracy.
[3346.12 --> 3346.70]  That's going to be...
[3347.28 --> 3349.36]  But hey, you won't have to pay as much taxes
[3349.36 --> 3352.80]  because you won't have to pay the judges for as many hours?
[3353.74 --> 3354.72]  Yeah, I guess.
[3355.58 --> 3358.98]  Until they just press that button
[3358.98 --> 3361.36]  and then sit in the office and sit on the phone?
[3361.36 --> 3361.76]  Judge Dredd?
[3361.92 --> 3365.14]  It is super amazing how easily dismantled
[3365.70 --> 3368.28]  the whole taxes or theft argument is.
[3368.82 --> 3369.30]  Oh, boy.
[3369.30 --> 3371.16]  And how quickly...
[3371.16 --> 3373.84]  How quickly people change their tune
[3373.84 --> 3377.72]  if the public resources available to them
[3377.72 --> 3380.04]  that they need are not there
[3380.04 --> 3381.32]  because they didn't pay for them.
[3381.40 --> 3381.72]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[3381.72 --> 3383.50]  Luke Car Taxi's here if you want to get going.
[3385.26 --> 3386.36]  All right.
[3386.36 --> 3388.22]  With that said,
[3388.64 --> 3391.40]  I am 100% angry,
[3391.86 --> 3393.12]  as everyone should be,
[3393.26 --> 3395.28]  about the way my tax dollars are wasted.
[3396.06 --> 3397.56]  They are not efficiently used.
[3397.66 --> 3398.20]  Oh, yeah.
[3398.42 --> 3398.98]  Oh, yeah.
[3399.08 --> 3401.66]  But weather taxes as a concept...
[3401.66 --> 3402.00]  Dude.
[3402.80 --> 3403.70]  ...should exist.
[3403.86 --> 3404.78]  It's like...
[3404.78 --> 3405.56]  Well, yeah,
[3405.86 --> 3407.28]  but the problem is corruption.
[3407.84 --> 3409.36]  I told you the whole...
[3409.36 --> 3411.44]  Was it invasive deer, I think it was,
[3411.44 --> 3412.12]  on that one island?
[3412.12 --> 3415.40]  Have I told you this story?
[3415.58 --> 3416.50]  The invasive deer story?
[3416.60 --> 3416.80]  What now?
[3416.82 --> 3417.68]  Let me try to find this up.
[3418.12 --> 3418.78]  Look this up.
[3418.90 --> 3419.22]  Hold on.
[3419.84 --> 3421.10]  Invasive deer,
[3421.58 --> 3422.68]  DC Island,
[3423.34 --> 3424.14]  helicopter,
[3424.86 --> 3425.24]  sniper.
[3427.52 --> 3429.58]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3429.96 --> 3431.24]  Yeah, you told me about this.
[3431.34 --> 3431.54]  Okay.
[3431.74 --> 3432.12]  All right.
[3432.74 --> 3435.46]  Tax dollars are spent extremely well.
[3435.96 --> 3437.80]  There are no problems
[3437.80 --> 3440.50]  with tax dollars.
[3440.76 --> 3442.10]  Tax dollars are fine.
[3442.36 --> 3443.98]  We need to get rid of some invasive deer
[3443.98 --> 3445.48]  that the hunters would really,
[3445.78 --> 3446.80]  really like to go after
[3446.80 --> 3448.40]  to the point where they would pay you
[3448.40 --> 3449.80]  to take these deer out.
[3449.88 --> 3450.82]  So why don't we spend
[3450.82 --> 3452.58]  over three quarters of a million dollars?
[3452.72 --> 3453.78]  Let's get some Americans
[3453.78 --> 3454.94]  to come up over the border,
[3455.28 --> 3456.46]  bring a helicopter,
[3456.90 --> 3458.44]  and go hunting with sniper rifles
[3458.44 --> 3459.12]  in the air
[3459.12 --> 3460.56]  to take out 84 deer,
[3460.72 --> 3463.22]  and let's spend almost a million dollars on it.
[3463.46 --> 3464.16]  Let's go!
[3465.08 --> 3465.64]  Trigg says,
[3465.64 --> 3467.36]  that's only $10,000 a deer, Luke.
[3469.32 --> 3471.52]  Isn't it like the emu war
[3471.52 --> 3473.26]  in Australia?
[3473.26 --> 3474.80]  That was a little bit more real.
[3474.88 --> 3475.80]  They deployed the army.
[3476.04 --> 3476.46]  That was...
[3476.46 --> 3477.16]  And still lost.
[3477.22 --> 3477.56]  Yeah.
[3477.80 --> 3478.06]  Yeah.
[3480.06 --> 3482.54]  This is 84 deer, dude.
[3483.32 --> 3483.78]  That...
[3483.78 --> 3484.64]  Hunters
[3484.64 --> 3486.54]  used to just hunt
[3486.54 --> 3487.38]  for them.
[3487.90 --> 3488.20]  Please.
[3488.38 --> 3489.18]  And it was fine.
[3489.38 --> 3490.70]  Don't bring this up again.
[3490.76 --> 3492.16]  It makes me irrationally angry.
[3492.16 --> 3492.46]  They were paid.
[3492.46 --> 3495.18]  You could gain tax dollars.
[3495.74 --> 3496.16]  Instead,
[3496.36 --> 3497.60]  you spent them.
[3499.74 --> 3500.04]  Ah!
[3500.72 --> 3501.92]  As someone who pays
[3501.92 --> 3503.74]  a lot of fucking taxes,
[3504.42 --> 3505.52]  I promise you
[3505.52 --> 3506.56]  that this makes me
[3506.56 --> 3507.54]  far more angry
[3507.54 --> 3509.12]  than my currently calm,
[3509.28 --> 3510.20]  composed demeanor
[3510.20 --> 3510.80]  would suggest.
[3511.02 --> 3511.80]  It's so infi...
[3511.80 --> 3512.36]  I can't...
[3512.36 --> 3514.24]  Like, it actually hurts
[3514.24 --> 3515.36]  my...
[3515.36 --> 3516.00]  Yeah, look.
[3516.12 --> 3516.68]  Look, hold on.
[3516.74 --> 3516.98]  Sorry.
[3516.98 --> 3519.72]  The cost of the first phase,
[3519.86 --> 3520.42]  which includes
[3520.42 --> 3521.20]  the helicopter
[3521.20 --> 3521.98]  and marksman
[3521.98 --> 3522.84]  from the US
[3522.84 --> 3523.90]  and New Zealand,
[3524.70 --> 3525.70]  for some reason,
[3526.10 --> 3528.38]  is about $834,000.
[3528.60 --> 3529.70]  It's about that much.
[3529.88 --> 3531.22]  That's only the first phase.
[3531.48 --> 3532.20]  The eradication
[3532.20 --> 3533.08]  is part of a nearly
[3533.08 --> 3534.02]  $6 million
[3534.02 --> 3535.46]  multi-year project
[3535.46 --> 3536.48]  to restore the land.
[3537.04 --> 3537.60]  Okay.
[3537.98 --> 3538.92]  That's cool.
[3539.88 --> 3540.30]  Sick.
[3540.54 --> 3541.00]  Meanwhile,
[3541.10 --> 3542.12]  do you know what's going on
[3542.12 --> 3543.14]  in Surrey schools?
[3543.68 --> 3544.04]  No.
[3544.04 --> 3544.12]  Oh.
[3545.74 --> 3546.22]  Oh.
[3546.90 --> 3547.88]  Instead of having
[3547.88 --> 3549.12]  a fixed school day,
[3549.66 --> 3550.16]  like, you know,
[3550.24 --> 3551.44]  8.30 to 3 p.m.
[3551.48 --> 3552.00]  or whatever.
[3552.18 --> 3553.06]  Oh, I've heard about this.
[3553.56 --> 3555.40]  They have staggered
[3555.40 --> 3556.36]  school days,
[3556.68 --> 3557.64]  so some students
[3557.64 --> 3558.92]  and therefore teachers
[3558.92 --> 3560.06]  start earlier
[3560.06 --> 3560.76]  and end earlier,
[3560.92 --> 3562.52]  and some start later
[3562.52 --> 3563.70]  and end later,
[3564.14 --> 3565.54]  vastly extending
[3565.54 --> 3567.68]  the potential school day,
[3567.78 --> 3569.52]  making after-school care
[3569.52 --> 3570.82]  and after-school,
[3571.26 --> 3572.76]  like, activity planning
[3572.76 --> 3573.24]  for parents
[3573.24 --> 3574.76]  a flippant nightmare.
[3575.62 --> 3576.16]  Not to mention
[3576.16 --> 3577.50]  inconveniencing teachers
[3577.50 --> 3578.12]  who...
[3578.12 --> 3578.44]  What if you're on
[3578.44 --> 3578.78]  the high school
[3578.78 --> 3579.52]  basketball team
[3579.52 --> 3580.76]  and the school
[3580.76 --> 3581.74]  that you're playing against
[3581.74 --> 3582.80]  does late hours
[3582.80 --> 3583.66]  and your school
[3583.66 --> 3584.44]  does early hours?
[3584.50 --> 3585.68]  It's student by student.
[3586.14 --> 3586.76]  Oh, God.
[3586.98 --> 3588.16]  Yeah, so you might...
[3589.38 --> 3590.26]  And this is because
[3590.26 --> 3592.08]  we don't have enough capacity.
[3592.90 --> 3595.10]  It's a whole thing.
[3595.32 --> 3595.92]  Yeah, basically,
[3596.06 --> 3597.14]  I don't have to explain this.
[3597.20 --> 3597.78]  People in the chat
[3597.78 --> 3598.28]  are picking up
[3598.28 --> 3598.98]  what I'm throwing down
[3598.98 --> 3599.60]  pretty quick here.
[3599.66 --> 3600.22]  It's a nightmare.
[3600.22 --> 3602.80]  But thank the maker
[3602.80 --> 3604.40]  we got rid of those deer.
[3606.14 --> 3607.66]  And to be clear,
[3608.10 --> 3609.16]  this is Parks Canada.
[3609.44 --> 3610.12]  This is federal.
[3610.60 --> 3611.86]  This is provincial and municipal.
[3612.28 --> 3613.44]  It's not actually
[3613.44 --> 3617.00]  necessarily the same coffers
[3617.00 --> 3617.90]  that were robbed
[3617.90 --> 3619.72]  to go on a little
[3619.72 --> 3620.86]  shooting expedition.
[3621.32 --> 3623.00]  You gotta assume that.
[3623.48 --> 3623.64]  You know,
[3623.72 --> 3624.64]  like, someone was buddies
[3624.64 --> 3625.36]  with someone
[3625.36 --> 3626.54]  to get the assignment
[3626.54 --> 3627.38]  to go...
[3627.38 --> 3628.24]  Do you know how much
[3628.24 --> 3629.22]  people would pay
[3629.22 --> 3632.44]  to go helicopter deer hunting?
[3633.66 --> 3634.16]  Oh, yeah.
[3634.70 --> 3635.06]  Like...
[3635.06 --> 3635.52]  Oh, yeah.
[3636.04 --> 3636.48]  Dude!
[3636.64 --> 3637.00]  Oh, yeah.
[3637.08 --> 3637.68]  You could turn this
[3637.68 --> 3638.90]  into a tourist attraction.
[3639.14 --> 3639.94]  Turn it into a huge event.
[3640.24 --> 3641.82]  The number of millions
[3641.82 --> 3642.40]  of dollars
[3642.40 --> 3643.80]  of tourism dollars
[3643.80 --> 3644.94]  that you could generate
[3644.94 --> 3645.76]  for the province
[3645.76 --> 3647.64]  by just making this
[3647.64 --> 3648.46]  a tourist attraction
[3648.46 --> 3649.48]  over the next few years.
[3649.64 --> 3650.38]  You're spending
[3650.38 --> 3651.22]  six million dollars?
[3651.34 --> 3652.68]  Are you kidding me?
[3652.68 --> 3653.62]  Just tell...
[3653.62 --> 3655.72]  Just tell the hunters
[3655.72 --> 3656.98]  of North America,
[3657.24 --> 3657.64]  because I'm sure
[3657.64 --> 3658.76]  people would travel for this.
[3659.02 --> 3660.62]  Hey, we'll give you
[3660.62 --> 3661.60]  a hundred bucks a deer.
[3662.22 --> 3662.44]  Oh, dear.
[3662.44 --> 3662.82]  And you don't have
[3662.82 --> 3663.74]  to pay us anything.
[3664.52 --> 3664.74]  Dude.
[3664.98 --> 3665.54]  No, you know why
[3665.54 --> 3666.30]  they shouldn't do that.
[3666.54 --> 3667.74]  Problem entirely...
[3667.74 --> 3668.30]  Oh, viper heads.
[3668.30 --> 3668.90]  You know why
[3668.90 --> 3669.76]  they're not supposed
[3669.76 --> 3670.36]  to do that.
[3670.58 --> 3670.94]  Viper heads.
[3671.00 --> 3671.72]  Snake rats.
[3671.84 --> 3672.10]  Yeah.
[3672.30 --> 3672.56]  Yeah.
[3673.40 --> 3674.32]  You know that whole thing?
[3674.44 --> 3675.64]  But if you only gave
[3675.64 --> 3678.68]  a license to the parks...
[3678.68 --> 3680.14]  Like, only people
[3680.14 --> 3681.68]  who can kill these deer
[3681.68 --> 3683.10]  are sanctioned by us,
[3683.70 --> 3684.42]  and all of them
[3684.42 --> 3685.22]  have to be accounted for,
[3685.32 --> 3685.90]  maybe that saves it.
[3685.90 --> 3686.60]  Yeah, maybe that would be fine.
[3686.62 --> 3687.56]  But if you pay per head,
[3687.64 --> 3688.30]  then, yeah, no.
[3690.68 --> 3692.56]  Viper head argument.
[3692.90 --> 3693.88]  Let me see if I can find this.
[3693.90 --> 3694.78]  I haven't heard of this.
[3695.46 --> 3696.54]  We're about to get a lesson.
[3697.14 --> 3698.22]  I also know it as rats.
[3698.40 --> 3698.92]  I think it's...
[3698.92 --> 3699.92]  I've heard this story
[3699.92 --> 3700.58]  a bunch of times.
[3700.66 --> 3701.32]  I don't know if any of them
[3701.32 --> 3702.26]  are actually, like...
[3702.26 --> 3702.96]  Might be snakes.
[3703.14 --> 3703.72]  I don't know what it is.
[3703.72 --> 3704.40]  The original one.
[3704.42 --> 3705.14]  I don't remember exactly.
[3705.24 --> 3705.52]  Oh!
[3706.70 --> 3707.36]  Yeah, viper.
[3707.68 --> 3707.84]  Yeah.
[3707.98 --> 3708.22]  Snakes.
[3708.30 --> 3708.38]  Yeah.
[3708.38 --> 3709.40]  I think the snakes
[3709.40 --> 3710.22]  was the original one, yeah.
[3710.60 --> 3711.14]  I don't know.
[3711.24 --> 3711.74]  Either way.
[3712.00 --> 3712.58]  Cobra heads!
[3712.70 --> 3713.04]  That's it.
[3713.14 --> 3713.52]  Not viper.
[3713.66 --> 3714.30]  Yeah, cobra heads.
[3714.64 --> 3715.68]  Indian cobra head problem.
[3715.96 --> 3716.82]  So the government
[3716.82 --> 3717.74]  wanted to get rid of...
[3717.74 --> 3718.44]  Or the local government
[3718.44 --> 3719.48]  or whatever wanted to get...
[3719.48 --> 3720.40]  I might say this
[3720.40 --> 3721.10]  slightly wrong, I'm sorry.
[3721.42 --> 3722.86]  They wanted to get rid of cobras.
[3723.30 --> 3723.52]  Okay.
[3723.62 --> 3724.12]  So they were like,
[3724.16 --> 3725.38]  okay, we'll put a bounty
[3725.38 --> 3726.16]  on cobra heads.
[3726.50 --> 3726.66]  Yeah.
[3726.68 --> 3727.70]  So if people find a cobra
[3727.70 --> 3728.52]  and they kill the cobra,
[3728.66 --> 3729.74]  they can hand in the cobra head
[3729.74 --> 3730.32]  and they make money.
[3730.40 --> 3731.00]  What if they put it
[3731.00 --> 3731.86]  in a Romanian jail?
[3734.88 --> 3735.68]  Cobra, cobra...
[3735.68 --> 3736.44]  Okay, I got you.
[3737.00 --> 3738.10]  That was pretty good.
[3738.10 --> 3740.78]  But they...
[3740.78 --> 3741.50]  People just started
[3741.50 --> 3742.38]  breeding cobras
[3742.38 --> 3744.56]  so they could farm cobra heads.
[3746.12 --> 3746.88]  Got it.
[3747.12 --> 3747.76]  And then,
[3747.88 --> 3748.74]  you always forget the...
[3748.74 --> 3749.78]  Don't forget the end bit.
[3750.50 --> 3751.42]  Okay, so apparently
[3751.42 --> 3752.64]  last year,
[3752.76 --> 3753.52]  locals called
[3753.52 --> 3755.08]  2,000 deer
[3755.08 --> 3756.68]  at no cost.
[3757.68 --> 3758.80]  And apparently
[3758.80 --> 3759.80]  25%
[3759.80 --> 3761.00]  of the 84 deer
[3761.00 --> 3761.80]  that were called
[3761.80 --> 3762.96]  were actually
[3762.96 --> 3763.52]  local,
[3763.64 --> 3764.90]  non-invasive deer.
[3764.90 --> 3765.52]  Oh, great.
[3766.52 --> 3767.30]  Probably because
[3767.30 --> 3767.74]  they were up
[3767.74 --> 3768.46]  in a helicopter.
[3768.86 --> 3769.14]  Yeah.
[3769.24 --> 3770.04]  Trying to identify
[3770.04 --> 3771.18]  a particular species
[3771.18 --> 3771.76]  of deer.
[3772.02 --> 3772.32]  Yeah.
[3774.64 --> 3775.32]  I...
[3775.32 --> 3776.38]  It's actually
[3776.38 --> 3777.28]  like it...
[3777.28 --> 3777.90]  I...
[3777.90 --> 3781.78]  It actually
[3781.78 --> 3782.44]  causes me
[3782.44 --> 3783.26]  physical pain.
[3783.82 --> 3784.74]  I believe
[3784.74 --> 3785.30]  the world
[3785.30 --> 3785.92]  is worse
[3785.92 --> 3786.44]  and humans
[3786.44 --> 3787.38]  are worse for it
[3787.38 --> 3788.36]  having known
[3788.36 --> 3788.96]  that story.
[3790.20 --> 3790.76]  Cool.
[3791.32 --> 3792.32]  The cobra head story
[3792.32 --> 3793.30]  depresses me
[3793.30 --> 3794.12]  a lot less
[3794.12 --> 3795.58]  than the cobra head story.
[3795.58 --> 3796.60]  And it's very clear.
[3796.78 --> 3797.48]  Didn't I finish it?
[3797.56 --> 3798.60]  No, there's an end part
[3798.60 --> 3799.04]  as well.
[3799.40 --> 3800.42]  Because everybody's
[3800.42 --> 3801.04]  been breeding
[3801.04 --> 3801.80]  these cobras
[3801.80 --> 3802.54]  and then the government
[3802.54 --> 3802.80]  goes,
[3802.92 --> 3803.88]  oh, people are breeding them
[3803.88 --> 3804.60]  and then they get rid
[3804.60 --> 3805.10]  of the bounty
[3805.10 --> 3806.08]  and then they just
[3806.08 --> 3807.62]  release all of the cobras.
[3807.80 --> 3808.36]  So now it's
[3808.36 --> 3809.54]  even worse than before.
[3809.72 --> 3809.92]  Yeah.
[3810.28 --> 3810.74]  You'd think they'd
[3810.74 --> 3811.28]  just kill them.
[3813.10 --> 3813.60]  No, but like
[3813.60 --> 3814.44]  you gotta keep...
[3814.44 --> 3815.70]  Like, why would I bother now?
[3815.84 --> 3816.70]  The snakes are gross.
[3817.72 --> 3819.10]  Well, yeah, but I've...
[3819.10 --> 3819.66]  Honestly,
[3819.66 --> 3820.60]  I would think it's like
[3820.60 --> 3821.30]  kind of a hassle
[3821.30 --> 3822.38]  to release a cobra.
[3822.56 --> 3823.14]  I'm assuming it was...
[3823.14 --> 3824.28]  Because you'd have to be near it,
[3824.30 --> 3825.16]  you know, or something.
[3825.30 --> 3826.04]  Just open it up.
[3826.16 --> 3826.76]  Toss it out the window.
[3826.92 --> 3828.02]  Yeah, dump it off a building.
[3828.46 --> 3829.72]  Yeah, I guess.
[3829.88 --> 3830.20]  But like,
[3830.24 --> 3830.88]  wouldn't it be easier
[3830.88 --> 3832.04]  to just not do anything
[3832.04 --> 3833.32]  and just like let it die?
[3833.62 --> 3835.22]  Like, I don't know.
[3836.16 --> 3837.32]  I feel like it's a bit
[3837.32 --> 3837.82]  of a protest.
[3837.94 --> 3838.84]  Give us our bounty back.
[3839.30 --> 3840.02]  Ah, I could see that.
[3840.02 --> 3840.50]  Because at that point
[3840.50 --> 3841.88]  it's a business for people, right?
[3842.20 --> 3843.26]  Yeah, I could see that.
[3843.28 --> 3843.86]  You ruined my business.
[3844.86 --> 3845.48]  Yeah, I could see that.
[3845.48 --> 3846.70]  Yeah, put them on planes.
[3847.90 --> 3848.60]  Thanks, Travis.
[3849.66 --> 3851.84]  Also, the quotes
[3851.84 --> 3852.82]  about the 2000 deer
[3852.82 --> 3853.10]  or whatever,
[3853.22 --> 3853.86]  that was from
[3853.86 --> 3854.98]  Creator Warehouse Sebastian.
[3855.08 --> 3856.78]  I don't know if I mentioned that or not.
[3856.96 --> 3857.26]  All right.
[3857.48 --> 3858.22]  Thanks, Sebastian.
[3860.14 --> 3861.66]  Yeah, I just like...
[3861.66 --> 3862.26]  My goodness.
[3862.50 --> 3863.18]  I don't know how we got
[3863.18 --> 3863.82]  onto that topic.
[3864.02 --> 3865.00]  Let's talk about sponsors.
[3865.12 --> 3866.26]  Let's talk about our business.
[3866.64 --> 3867.04]  Yeah.
[3867.82 --> 3868.84]  Like from Manscaped.
[3869.18 --> 3870.20]  You might be drooling
[3870.20 --> 3870.84]  over the turkey
[3870.84 --> 3871.76]  on the dinner table,
[3872.10 --> 3872.84]  but don't forget,
[3872.84 --> 3874.12]  there's one other bird
[3874.12 --> 3875.26]  that really needs
[3875.26 --> 3876.16]  some attention.
[3876.68 --> 3878.54]  Where are we going with this?
[3878.56 --> 3879.18]  I get it.
[3879.18 --> 3879.52]  Okay.
[3879.80 --> 3880.72]  Our sponsor,
[3880.90 --> 3881.64]  Manscaped,

[3925.88 --> 3928.90]  Huh.
[3930.20 --> 3930.96]  The show is also
[3930.96 --> 3931.30]  brought to you
[3931.30 --> 3932.18]  by 1Password.
[3932.68 --> 3933.62]  This is Dennis,
[3933.88 --> 3934.66]  working from home,
[3935.02 --> 3935.60]  logging in from
[3935.60 --> 3936.54]  his personal laptop
[3936.54 --> 3937.82]  using a random app
[3937.82 --> 3938.58]  our IT team
[3938.58 --> 3939.54]  has never heard of.
[3940.00 --> 3941.28]  Little does he know,
[3941.70 --> 3942.46]  that could be where
[3942.46 --> 3943.58]  our next security
[3943.58 --> 3944.54]  incident happens.
[3944.68 --> 3945.00]  Oh.
[3946.12 --> 3947.34]  But that's the reality
[3947.34 --> 3948.14]  of today's workplace.
[3948.34 --> 3949.24]  With remote setups,
[3949.40 --> 3950.06]  personal devices,
[3950.32 --> 3951.16]  and unknown apps
[3951.16 --> 3952.24]  popping up everywhere,
[3952.40 --> 3953.34]  there are more security
[3953.34 --> 3954.44]  gaps than ever.
[3954.86 --> 3955.74]  That's where our sponsor
[3955.74 --> 3956.84]  1Password Extended
[3956.84 --> 3957.48]  Access Management

[3967.92 --> 3968.62]  addresses issues
[3968.62 --> 3969.64]  that traditional IAM
[3969.64 --> 3971.00]  and MDM can't handle,
[3971.24 --> 3972.28]  and it's available now
[3972.28 --> 3973.34]  for companies with Okta
[3973.34 --> 3974.90]  and Microsoft Entra
[3974.90 --> 3975.82]  and is in beta

[3983.68 --> 3984.82]  Never heard it out loud.
[3984.82 --> 3986.52]  Okta, if I remember correctly?
[3986.62 --> 3988.26]  So many of these things,
[3988.36 --> 3989.00]  people get pissed
[3989.00 --> 3989.80]  when you pronounce them wrong,
[3989.86 --> 3990.62]  but then I only ever
[3990.62 --> 3991.74]  see them written,
[3992.00 --> 3992.52]  so it's like,
[3992.56 --> 3993.06]  I don't know.
[3994.04 --> 3994.32]  Nice.
[3994.96 --> 3995.62]  Okta, people say.
[3995.68 --> 3996.16]  Okta, yeah.
[3998.04 --> 3999.32]  Arbiter K says,
[3999.46 --> 3999.94]  it's pronounced,
[4000.14 --> 4000.28]  quote,
[4000.46 --> 4001.14]  O-K-T-A,
[4001.40 --> 4001.76]  end quote.
[4002.04 --> 4002.56]  Thank you,
[4002.60 --> 4003.02]  very useful.
[4003.42 --> 4004.38]  The show is also brought
[4004.38 --> 4005.30]  to you by Squarespace.
[4006.18 --> 4006.84]  Let's come back
[4006.84 --> 4007.72]  to Dennis' scenario
[4007.72 --> 4008.22]  for a moment.
[4008.44 --> 4008.62]  Oh.
[4008.70 --> 4009.36]  Let's say he's working
[4009.36 --> 4009.82]  from home,
[4010.00 --> 4011.68]  but during work hours.
[4011.68 --> 4012.72]  He wants to build
[4012.72 --> 4013.94]  an online portfolio
[4013.94 --> 4015.40]  for a job interview.
[4015.52 --> 4015.88]  Wait, what?
[4015.94 --> 4016.54]  Why is he doing that
[4016.54 --> 4017.32]  during work hours?
[4018.02 --> 4018.98]  To save time
[4018.98 --> 4020.00]  and boost his chances,
[4020.46 --> 4021.24]  he should probably
[4021.24 --> 4022.10]  use our sponsor,
[4022.24 --> 4022.64]  Squarespace.
[4023.72 --> 4024.90]  It's an all-in-one
[4024.90 --> 4025.80]  website platform
[4025.80 --> 4026.56]  that uses AI
[4026.56 --> 4027.38]  to help anyone
[4027.38 --> 4028.12]  build a beautiful,
[4028.48 --> 4029.36]  personalized website
[4029.36 --> 4029.98]  with ease.
[4030.22 --> 4031.20]  They offer a variety
[4031.20 --> 4032.22]  of award-winning templates,
[4032.70 --> 4033.48]  helping you get your site
[4033.48 --> 4034.64]  up and running quickly.
[4035.08 --> 4036.36]  If you have an online business,
[4036.56 --> 4037.60]  you can send invoices
[4037.60 --> 4038.42]  and accept payments
[4038.42 --> 4039.00]  from your clients
[4039.00 --> 4039.44]  through debit,
[4039.44 --> 4039.72]  credit,
[4039.72 --> 4041.04]  ACH and more.
[4041.26 --> 4042.28]  Plus, with Squarespace,
[4042.60 --> 4043.92]  you get access to analytics
[4043.92 --> 4044.64]  so you can track
[4044.64 --> 4045.32]  your site's performance
[4045.32 --> 4046.80]  and see what works best
[4046.80 --> 4048.08]  for your business.
[4048.68 --> 4050.32]  Squarespace is easy to use,
[4050.58 --> 4051.40]  which is why we use it
[4051.40 --> 4052.32]  for our site, too.
[4052.42 --> 4053.20]  We actually have a redesign
[4053.20 --> 4054.16]  coming that is a lot
[4054.16 --> 4054.68]  more modern.
[4055.14 --> 4055.90]  I'm embarrassed
[4055.90 --> 4056.56]  we show this still,
[4056.66 --> 4057.20]  but anyway,
[4057.52 --> 4058.12]  the point is,
[4058.50 --> 4059.56]  you can also pick
[4059.56 --> 4060.54]  from tons of domain names
[4060.54 --> 4061.32]  with built-in privacy
[4061.32 --> 4061.86]  and security.
[4062.10 --> 4062.66]  So start building
[4062.66 --> 4063.56]  your website today
[4063.56 --> 4064.74]  and receive 10%
[4064.74 --> 4065.36]  off your purchase
[4065.36 --> 4065.84]  by visiting
[4065.84 --> 4066.90]  squarespace.com
[4066.90 --> 4068.28]  slash LTT.
[4068.28 --> 4069.76]  Why don't we do
[4069.76 --> 4070.28]  a merch message?
[4071.64 --> 4072.46]  If you want,
[4072.54 --> 4073.04]  yeah, sure.
[4073.24 --> 4074.10]  Are people enjoying
[4074.10 --> 4074.66]  the corkboard?
[4074.76 --> 4075.66]  It seems like a weird,
[4075.76 --> 4077.52]  it seems like a weird
[4077.52 --> 4078.70]  thing to,
[4078.70 --> 4079.10]  uh,
[4081.02 --> 4081.18]  oh,
[4081.26 --> 4081.38]  yeah,
[4081.60 --> 4082.52]  if only we sold pins.
[4083.22 --> 4083.60]  Yeah.
[4085.84 --> 4086.50]  Yeah, I don't know.
[4086.62 --> 4086.94]  What a weird,
[4087.02 --> 4087.46]  unexpected,
[4087.66 --> 4088.34]  unique use case.
[4088.80 --> 4089.40]  You never,
[4089.54 --> 4090.16]  you never know,
[4090.24 --> 4090.52]  you know,
[4090.54 --> 4090.92]  when you,
[4091.02 --> 4092.26]  when you develop
[4092.26 --> 4092.82]  a product,
[4092.98 --> 4093.22]  you know,
[4093.24 --> 4093.92]  if it'll ever make it
[4093.92 --> 4094.68]  to the finish line,
[4094.74 --> 4095.58]  if people will like it.
[4095.58 --> 4096.12]  Oh,
[4096.20 --> 4097.24]  people like corkboards.
[4097.66 --> 4097.94]  Okay.
[4098.16 --> 4099.68]  Speaking of the scenario
[4099.68 --> 4100.98]  that Dennis just gave us.
[4101.16 --> 4101.46]  Yes.
[4101.68 --> 4103.34]  If you were interviewing someone,
[4103.98 --> 4105.32]  you're not the interviewee,
[4105.36 --> 4106.24]  you're the interviewer.
[4106.72 --> 4107.12]  Yeah.
[4107.22 --> 4108.94]  And they show up on camera,
[4109.04 --> 4109.28]  you know,
[4109.62 --> 4110.82]  you do the webcam thing.
[4110.94 --> 4111.10]  Oh,
[4111.10 --> 4112.12]  this is a remote interview
[4112.12 --> 4112.64]  to be clear.
[4112.74 --> 4112.88]  Yeah.
[4113.30 --> 4114.36]  They show up on camera,
[4114.42 --> 4115.02]  they're in the webcam thing.
[4115.14 --> 4117.30]  You can tell they're in the office.
[4117.82 --> 4118.68]  Like at work.
[4118.78 --> 4120.02]  And they booked a meeting room.
[4120.06 --> 4120.22]  Yeah.
[4120.22 --> 4120.52]  It's a,
[4120.60 --> 4121.70]  it's a bad vibe.
[4122.10 --> 4122.74]  It's a bad vibe.
[4122.86 --> 4122.96]  Yeah.
[4123.30 --> 4123.70]  Yeah.
[4123.70 --> 4124.42]  Yeah.
[4124.56 --> 4124.78]  I,
[4124.78 --> 4125.42]  I definitely,
[4125.56 --> 4126.40]  that puts me,
[4126.52 --> 4126.84]  uh,
[4127.02 --> 4127.84]  cause it's like,
[4127.90 --> 4128.12]  uh,
[4128.12 --> 4128.42]  I don't know.
[4128.42 --> 4128.74]  It's like,
[4128.80 --> 4130.12]  it's like meeting your new man
[4130.12 --> 4131.26]  when he's still with her,
[4131.26 --> 4132.84]  you know?
[4135.36 --> 4136.30]  And I'm not saying
[4136.30 --> 4137.02]  that you should have
[4137.02 --> 4137.76]  the kind of loyalty
[4137.76 --> 4138.54]  to an employer
[4138.54 --> 4139.20]  that you would have
[4139.20 --> 4140.16]  to a significant other.
[4140.94 --> 4141.82]  Definitely not.
[4143.14 --> 4144.08]  But yeah,
[4144.08 --> 4145.46]  it's not a good vibe
[4145.46 --> 4146.62]  is all I'm saying.
[4146.90 --> 4147.20]  Yeah.
[4147.56 --> 4148.34]  Like have the,
[4148.42 --> 4149.26]  have the class
[4149.26 --> 4150.08]  to like,
[4150.86 --> 4151.46]  you know,
[4151.68 --> 4152.86]  be somewhere else.
[4154.70 --> 4155.70]  Schedule it for a time
[4155.70 --> 4156.36]  when you aren't,
[4156.36 --> 4156.66]  you know,
[4156.76 --> 4157.28]  clearly.
[4157.66 --> 4159.12]  What if you can tell?
[4159.36 --> 4159.66]  Yeah.
[4160.90 --> 4161.30]  That,
[4161.38 --> 4162.06]  uh,
[4163.26 --> 4164.98]  they're like in their car.
[4165.76 --> 4166.34]  That's fine.
[4167.20 --> 4167.84]  That's fine.
[4168.82 --> 4169.26]  Yeah.
[4169.66 --> 4171.24]  So they might even still be like,
[4171.28 --> 4171.52]  they,
[4171.56 --> 4172.92]  they basically just went outside.
[4173.18 --> 4173.58]  Yeah.
[4173.88 --> 4174.22]  Uh,
[4174.22 --> 4175.78]  flappy here says it might be their lunch,
[4175.88 --> 4177.38]  in which case it should be no problem
[4177.38 --> 4178.48]  for them to step out.
[4179.48 --> 4179.84]  Yeah.
[4180.18 --> 4181.10]  And yeah,
[4181.10 --> 4182.34]  cause they're technically using,
[4182.48 --> 4184.40]  like they're in a meeting room,
[4184.40 --> 4186.44]  like they're using company property.
[4186.72 --> 4187.00]  Yep.
[4187.18 --> 4190.02]  Which maybe it was a rental office.
[4190.44 --> 4190.92]  Uh,
[4191.50 --> 4192.20]  I doubt it.
[4192.38 --> 4192.82]  No,
[4192.98 --> 4194.50]  I understand what they're saying.
[4194.54 --> 4196.12]  It could also be a co-work space.
[4196.12 --> 4196.52]  Yeah.
[4196.58 --> 4198.18]  But usually you can tell.
[4198.58 --> 4198.70]  Yep.
[4199.02 --> 4199.30]  Uh,
[4199.30 --> 4200.88]  most office spaces I've,
[4200.88 --> 4201.20]  I've,
[4201.36 --> 4202.66]  I've seen this happen in,
[4203.12 --> 4203.40]  uh,
[4203.40 --> 4205.66]  usually you can tell there's like signage in the background
[4205.66 --> 4207.50]  or there's,
[4207.58 --> 4207.88]  you know,
[4207.88 --> 4209.48]  the name of the meeting room on the wall.
[4209.48 --> 4209.68]  Dan,
[4209.74 --> 4212.32]  we've got a segment for next week's WAN show.
[4212.50 --> 4212.78]  Oh yeah.
[4213.20 --> 4213.56]  Okay.
[4213.68 --> 4215.08]  So we're going to do a tier list.
[4215.56 --> 4220.08]  We are going to rank places that people are calling us from.
[4220.92 --> 4222.12]  So Dan,
[4222.24 --> 4222.46]  uh,
[4222.46 --> 4223.92]  how's the merch message load this week?
[4223.94 --> 4226.32]  Do you have a little bit of time to keep an eye on the,
[4226.40 --> 4226.72]  uh,
[4226.88 --> 4227.84]  on the chat for a bit?
[4227.96 --> 4228.14]  Yeah.
[4228.56 --> 4228.90]  Okay,
[4228.90 --> 4229.22]  cool.
[4229.38 --> 4232.34]  So if you want to kind of put them together and,
[4232.34 --> 4232.52]  uh,
[4232.52 --> 4232.96]  we're going to do,
[4233.06 --> 4234.62]  we're going to do a tier list next week.
[4234.92 --> 4235.32]  Um,
[4235.32 --> 4235.94]  and so guys,
[4235.94 --> 4238.40]  if you want to hit up the float plane chat for Dan,
[4238.40 --> 4240.96]  and he can kind of take some of the good suggestions that he sees.
[4240.96 --> 4245.34]  And then next week Luke and I will rank and we can,
[4245.52 --> 4246.40]  we can have some,
[4246.44 --> 4246.66]  you know,
[4246.70 --> 4248.40]  honorable mentions for ones that are funny.
[4248.46 --> 4248.76]  Sure.
[4248.76 --> 4250.12]  But in all seriousness,
[4250.48 --> 4258.40]  let's rank how good of a foot it puts forward for locations that,
[4258.40 --> 4259.00]  that you,
[4259.18 --> 4260.96]  that what you would think when,
[4261.10 --> 4261.32]  uh,
[4261.36 --> 4261.54]  yeah,
[4261.54 --> 4262.92]  I think this will be kind of fun.
[4263.00 --> 4263.40]  Uh,
[4263.40 --> 4265.58]  if we could have a board that,
[4265.70 --> 4266.06]  um,
[4266.56 --> 4267.70]  if it's possible,
[4267.70 --> 4274.60]  allows me and Luke to rank things on our own without seeing each other's answers.
[4274.66 --> 4275.00]  I don't know.
[4275.22 --> 4275.40]  Well,
[4275.40 --> 4276.44]  we'll find a fun way to do it,
[4276.52 --> 4276.70]  but,
[4276.80 --> 4276.98]  um,
[4276.98 --> 4280.28]  you could just take that metal board Sammy had and just like tape a foam thing in the
[4280.28 --> 4280.44]  middle.
[4280.52 --> 4280.70]  Yeah.
[4280.78 --> 4280.98]  Yeah.
[4280.98 --> 4282.62]  Something like that would probably work fine.
[4282.82 --> 4283.42]  And then,
[4283.42 --> 4283.68]  uh,
[4283.68 --> 4285.04]  if we just had like little,
[4285.04 --> 4285.48]  uh,
[4285.48 --> 4287.80]  little printout magnets or labels,
[4287.80 --> 4288.78]  we could even just have labels.
[4288.88 --> 4289.70]  They don't even have to be magnetic.
[4289.80 --> 4291.08]  We just peeled them off after the show,
[4291.12 --> 4293.54]  but we could just put them on just with the words.
[4293.62 --> 4294.62]  That'd be kind of fun.
[4295.20 --> 4295.58]  All right.
[4295.58 --> 4296.34]  When I hired,
[4296.46 --> 4296.84]  uh,
[4296.98 --> 4297.32]  Yuki,
[4297.60 --> 4302.52]  when I called him to offer him the job effectively,
[4302.52 --> 4303.34]  um,
[4303.34 --> 4305.16]  he was making sushi at the time.
[4305.34 --> 4307.90]  And for the entire duration of that conversation,
[4307.90 --> 4309.72]  he did not stop making sushi.
[4310.02 --> 4310.94]  That's kind of Chad.
[4311.06 --> 4312.50]  It was pretty sick.
[4313.50 --> 4314.74]  I remember when I,
[4314.80 --> 4315.60]  when I finally hung up,
[4315.62 --> 4315.98]  I was like,
[4316.08 --> 4316.34]  huh.
[4317.96 --> 4318.64]  All right.
[4318.72 --> 4319.12]  Multitasking.
[4319.30 --> 4319.70]  Yeah.
[4320.06 --> 4322.72]  You know about the swastika that Dennis had on his wall,
[4322.78 --> 4322.98]  right?
[4323.18 --> 4324.02]  During his interview.
[4324.02 --> 4326.02]  Uh,
[4327.86 --> 4328.46]  Dennis Liao.
[4328.80 --> 4329.14]  Yeah,
[4329.24 --> 4329.52]  no,
[4329.62 --> 4333.24]  this actually now rings a bell.
[4334.00 --> 4335.02]  They didn't know what it was.
[4335.06 --> 4335.26]  No,
[4335.36 --> 4336.56]  he was at a protest.
[4337.18 --> 4340.98]  He was protesting a policy that the,
[4340.98 --> 4341.64]  the sign,
[4341.74 --> 4344.16]  cause I couldn't read the sign cause it was in Chinese.
[4344.66 --> 4345.96]  So the sign was like,
[4346.04 --> 4348.56]  this policy is like Nazism.
[4348.56 --> 4348.90]  Yeah.
[4349.02 --> 4350.02]  I remember this now.
[4350.14 --> 4350.54]  Yeah.
[4351.12 --> 4352.46]  But I had to ask,
[4352.88 --> 4353.88]  you know,
[4354.14 --> 4355.04]  Oh,
[4355.08 --> 4355.54]  what's that?
[4355.62 --> 4357.02]  Cause back then,
[4357.24 --> 4357.68]  you know,
[4358.68 --> 4362.56]  that kind of stuff hadn't made its way into mainstream acceptance again yet.
[4363.12 --> 4363.52]  Um,
[4363.52 --> 4364.76]  I don't know if it's acceptance.
[4364.94 --> 4365.18]  Yeah.
[4365.34 --> 4366.18]  I don't know where you go.
[4366.58 --> 4366.98]  Um,
[4366.98 --> 4368.10]  anyway.
[4368.30 --> 4368.56]  Yeah.
[4368.56 --> 4369.96]  So I definitely had to ask.
[4370.74 --> 4371.14]  Um,
[4371.14 --> 4371.52]  but yeah,
[4371.60 --> 4372.24]  he was like,
[4372.84 --> 4373.64]  Oh no,
[4373.68 --> 4373.84]  no,
[4373.90 --> 4374.08]  no,
[4374.08 --> 4374.22]  no,
[4374.22 --> 4374.36]  no,
[4374.36 --> 4374.38]  no.
[4374.38 --> 4374.60]  That,
[4374.70 --> 4374.80]  yeah,
[4374.88 --> 4375.12]  no,
[4375.22 --> 4375.38]  no,
[4375.44 --> 4375.54]  no,
[4375.54 --> 4375.74]  no.
[4376.16 --> 4378.00]  It was either swastika or it was a picture of Hitler.
[4378.10 --> 4378.60]  I can't remember,
[4378.68 --> 4379.44]  but either way it was,
[4379.84 --> 4380.96]  it was not a good,
[4381.02 --> 4381.34]  uh,
[4381.82 --> 4383.52]  was not a good first impression.
[4384.20 --> 4384.44]  Uh,
[4384.44 --> 4385.42]  how many of these do you want?
[4385.46 --> 4386.52]  I have 31 now.
[4387.00 --> 4388.68]  I think that's more than enough.
[4388.68 --> 4390.54]  So why don't we do another merch message?
[4391.00 --> 4391.44]  Uh,
[4391.48 --> 4391.70]  yeah,
[4391.74 --> 4391.96]  sure.
[4392.10 --> 4392.34]  Uh,
[4392.34 --> 4393.24]  give me one sec.
[4394.78 --> 4395.76]  Okie dokie.
[4395.96 --> 4396.78]  Merch messages.
[4397.28 --> 4397.52]  Hi,
[4397.66 --> 4398.50]  Linus and Luke.
[4398.58 --> 4400.62]  I have a question for you both.
[4400.92 --> 4401.32]  Um,
[4401.34 --> 4401.64]  okay.
[4401.88 --> 4405.30]  Me and a friend have worked on building a game for a friend and I,
[4405.40 --> 4405.80]  you're welcome.
[4405.90 --> 4408.98]  Your grammar has now been corrected and thank you for sending in your
[4408.98 --> 4409.44]  merch message.
[4409.56 --> 4411.12]  I was going to correct them for them.
[4411.22 --> 4412.12]  And I thought I wouldn't,
[4412.78 --> 4413.26]  uh,
[4413.40 --> 4415.92]  they've been building a game for 7,000 hours.
[4415.92 --> 4418.60]  How do we know when it's ready for public beta?
[4418.86 --> 4420.06]  When you're at 10,000 hours.
[4420.98 --> 4421.20]  What?
[4421.30 --> 4421.86]  What do you even?
[4422.22 --> 4423.84]  That's the base level of a skill,
[4423.98 --> 4424.16]  right?
[4424.50 --> 4424.74]  What?
[4424.90 --> 4425.48]  10,000 hours.
[4425.72 --> 4426.30]  I mean,
[4426.32 --> 4427.52]  that's not what they're asking.
[4428.40 --> 4430.52]  They're like milestone wise.
[4430.70 --> 4432.08]  About 60,
[4432.46 --> 4434.28]  990 hours ago.
[4435.04 --> 4436.42]  To be perfectly honest,
[4436.56 --> 4437.02]  fail fast,
[4437.10 --> 4437.62]  fail early.
[4438.28 --> 4439.28]  Is your fantasy game fun?
[4439.42 --> 4440.26]  Even though no one's played it.
[4441.32 --> 4441.64]  Uh,
[4442.60 --> 4443.66]  come on.
[4443.66 --> 4445.90]  Both of you are being supremely unhelpful.
[4445.92 --> 4446.46]  Right now.
[4447.36 --> 4447.72]  Supremely.
[4447.82 --> 4448.04]  Now.
[4448.14 --> 4448.36]  Do it.
[4448.40 --> 4449.22]  Do it right now.
[4450.24 --> 4450.50]  Yeah.
[4450.86 --> 4451.22]  Yeah.
[4451.24 --> 4451.62]  What do you want?
[4451.68 --> 4451.98]  Do now.
[4452.14 --> 4454.40]  Unless it's in alpha and it has been for a while and it's like,
[4454.46 --> 4455.68]  actually all together.
[4455.94 --> 4456.00]  Oh,
[4456.08 --> 4457.20]  send it to us now.
[4457.26 --> 4457.48]  Yeah.
[4457.60 --> 4458.16]  Come on.
[4458.30 --> 4458.76]  I want to play.
[4458.82 --> 4459.28]  I want to play a show.
[4459.48 --> 4460.22]  Where's my key?
[4460.48 --> 4460.68]  Yeah.
[4460.78 --> 4461.54]  I'm an influencer.
[4463.92 --> 4466.02]  I'll give you a shout out to my 75 followers.
[4466.02 --> 4467.02]  Uh,
[4467.02 --> 4469.42]  if for public beta,
[4469.56 --> 4469.86]  I mean,
[4470.56 --> 4472.06]  you can do rolling datas with steam.
[4472.14 --> 4472.24]  Now.
[4472.40 --> 4475.88]  I would try to get some friends that you can trust to,
[4476.08 --> 4478.34]  to not puffery you,
[4478.34 --> 4479.50]  um,
[4479.50 --> 4482.22]  and see if they actually have fun with the game.
[4482.56 --> 4484.00]  And if they actually have fun with the game,
[4484.10 --> 4484.42]  then yeah,
[4484.48 --> 4485.84]  do a public test or do something else.
[4485.92 --> 4486.06]  Yeah.
[4486.06 --> 4487.74]  If it's in private alpha or private beta,
[4487.88 --> 4488.60]  go public beta,
[4488.74 --> 4489.88]  do it in small rollout.
[4490.08 --> 4491.26]  As far as my understanding goes,
[4491.30 --> 4493.48]  it's pretty common in the,
[4493.48 --> 4498.94]  in the small time game developer kind of space thing for people to pass their
[4498.94 --> 4501.28]  stuff back and forth and get feedback from each other and,
[4501.28 --> 4502.72]  and do things that way as well.
[4502.72 --> 4504.38]  So maybe join like a forum or a discord,
[4504.50 --> 4505.66]  probably a discord these days.
[4506.22 --> 4506.62]  Um,
[4506.66 --> 4510.48]  and see if there's people that are interested and willing to do a little play
[4510.48 --> 4511.22]  test of your game,
[4511.52 --> 4512.28]  do that.
[4512.74 --> 4513.44]  Tesla waters.
[4513.88 --> 4517.74]  Cause there might be something that like you and the person that you're
[4517.74 --> 4518.52]  working on it with,
[4518.52 --> 4519.64]  uh,
[4520.08 --> 4523.68]  think is just fine because you've done it a trillion times,
[4523.68 --> 4525.78]  but then someone with a new perspective might,
[4525.86 --> 4527.08]  might run into it and be like,
[4527.12 --> 4527.76]  I don't get this.
[4528.18 --> 4528.58]  Yeah.
[4528.58 --> 4529.86]  And it might be fairly easy to fix.
[4529.94 --> 4530.62]  So I would,
[4530.70 --> 4532.12]  I would do it that way first and then,
[4532.12 --> 4533.46]  then try to hit it with something else.
[4533.54 --> 4534.94]  Or you have to redesign the entire thing,
[4535.02 --> 4538.06]  which happens a lot to something that you are okay with.
[4538.14 --> 4539.18]  Nobody seems to be okay with.
[4539.50 --> 4541.50]  Genesis says that's been a source of hacking too.
[4541.66 --> 4541.82]  Yeah,
[4541.86 --> 4542.24]  of course,
[4542.30 --> 4542.48]  any,
[4542.58 --> 4544.54]  any time that there's file sharing in any community,
[4544.54 --> 4545.46]  it's a source of hacking.
[4545.70 --> 4546.06]  Uh,
[4546.06 --> 4546.98]  you can open it in,
[4546.98 --> 4547.30]  in,
[4547.30 --> 4548.18]  uh,
[4548.18 --> 4549.36]  some type of secure system,
[4549.52 --> 4549.74]  whatever.
[4550.88 --> 4552.66]  Doesn't pirate software help with this kind of thing?
[4552.70 --> 4553.44]  I have no idea.
[4553.78 --> 4558.52]  That sounds like it would be an incredible amount of work considering the size of
[4558.52 --> 4559.46]  creator that he is.
[4560.62 --> 4561.14]  All right.
[4561.18 --> 4561.82]  Hit us with one more,
[4561.90 --> 4562.06]  Dan.
[4562.12 --> 4562.50]  Hey,
[4562.54 --> 4564.74]  you guys did a sponsored video on sleep buds.
[4564.84 --> 4565.14]  Sure did.
[4565.30 --> 4565.96]  How are they?
[4566.06 --> 4566.90]  Are you still using them?
[4567.18 --> 4567.54]  Um,
[4567.60 --> 4570.64]  also saw the announcement video has 21 million views.
[4570.84 --> 4572.60]  Insane for a product launch like this.
[4572.90 --> 4573.36]  All right.
[4573.42 --> 4574.04]  A couple of things,
[4574.04 --> 4574.34]  uh,
[4574.34 --> 4574.50]  here.
[4574.60 --> 4575.28]  So first of all,
[4575.60 --> 4575.82]  uh,
[4575.82 --> 4576.90]  even in a sponsored video,
[4576.90 --> 4580.22]  I won't say anything that I do not genuinely believe.
[4580.58 --> 4580.90]  Uh,
[4580.90 --> 4581.50]  first of all,
[4581.60 --> 4583.90]  it's against FTC guidelines.
[4584.16 --> 4584.36]  Uh,
[4584.36 --> 4585.00]  second of all,
[4585.66 --> 4588.26]  it would completely nuke my credibility.
[4588.26 --> 4592.96]  That doesn't mean I've never said anything that has turned out to not be true.
[4592.96 --> 4593.64]  Um,
[4593.64 --> 4604.62]  but what I do make a point of is separating things that are talking points from the brand and are clearly provided by the brand and things that I think.
[4604.62 --> 4612.38]  And I won't say anything about my own opinion that isn't actually true regardless of whether it is sponsored or not sponsored.
[4612.38 --> 4616.36]  This has nuked many a sponsor deal,
[4616.78 --> 4617.24]  um,
[4618.24 --> 4621.74]  caused many an issue for our poor business team,
[4621.84 --> 4623.40]  the hardworking souls that they are,
[4623.50 --> 4626.94]  but it is not something that there's any flexibility on for us.
[4627.06 --> 4628.08]  And I have even,
[4628.66 --> 4629.10]  um,
[4629.34 --> 4641.60]  very recently actually lectured other hosts and writers about making sure that they hold their ground and do not allow any words to be put in their mouth that they do not agree with.
[4641.60 --> 4642.08]  Um,
[4642.08 --> 4642.42]  um,
[4642.44 --> 4644.14]  one of our writers was told,
[4644.58 --> 4644.94]  um,
[4645.02 --> 4647.78]  by someone in the production chain,
[4648.22 --> 4648.62]  um,
[4648.90 --> 4649.24]  hey,
[4649.52 --> 4649.98]  um,
[4650.20 --> 4651.88]  can you just record this as a pickup,
[4652.36 --> 4653.08]  uh,
[4653.08 --> 4656.00]  in case the brand requires it and,
[4656.00 --> 4656.56]  uh,
[4656.56 --> 4658.08]  hopefully we won't have to use it.
[4658.14 --> 4661.14]  And it was something that they weren't a hundred percent comfortable with,
[4661.14 --> 4665.38]  not because they didn't like the product or because it was wrong.
[4665.46 --> 4668.10]  It was just a little more enthusiastic than they were.
[4668.30 --> 4670.84]  The tone was not how they actually felt about it.
[4670.84 --> 4673.38]  I overheard this conversation and I basically said,
[4673.44 --> 4673.56]  look,
[4673.60 --> 4676.96]  I got a really good piece of advice once on a shoot,
[4677.10 --> 4677.50]  um,
[4677.50 --> 4680.28]  for a car commercial that I did like years and years ago.
[4680.76 --> 4681.20]  And,
[4681.36 --> 4681.70]  um,
[4681.72 --> 4684.28]  I was told to say something about the,
[4684.36 --> 4687.14]  the definition of the screen and the center display.
[4687.14 --> 4688.30]  And I said,
[4688.40 --> 4688.58]  Hey,
[4688.68 --> 4688.98]  well,
[4689.16 --> 4689.34]  uh,
[4689.34 --> 4689.50]  okay,
[4689.50 --> 4690.76]  what's the actual pixel count?
[4690.82 --> 4692.62]  Because I'm not going to say those words.
[4693.10 --> 4696.78]  If I don't know that it's like something that aligns with those words,
[4696.78 --> 4697.58]  like I'm a tech guy,
[4697.62 --> 4702.56]  that's my entire identity is that I wouldn't say high definition unless it
[4702.56 --> 4705.66]  actually had a pixel count that could correspond to high definition.
[4705.66 --> 4706.80]  If you just mean like,
[4707.58 --> 4709.14]  like reasonably fine PPI,
[4709.98 --> 4710.18]  then,
[4710.32 --> 4711.26]  then I'll have to say that.
[4711.32 --> 4711.44]  Like,
[4711.44 --> 4713.04]  I have to say what it actually is.
[4713.54 --> 4715.14]  And they like gave me a really hard time.
[4715.16 --> 4716.44]  And they asked me to do the same thing.
[4716.50 --> 4719.82]  They asked me to record it both ways,
[4719.86 --> 4721.10]  the way that I wanted to say it,
[4721.16 --> 4724.82]  that hedged and the way that was exactly their words.
[4725.04 --> 4727.40]  And then they would find out and they would,
[4727.44 --> 4727.68]  you know,
[4727.72 --> 4729.22]  make sure before they do the edit.
[4729.62 --> 4730.36]  And I said,
[4730.38 --> 4730.50]  no,
[4730.54 --> 4731.52]  I'm not going to do that.
[4731.78 --> 4733.54]  You have like 30 people here.
[4734.10 --> 4735.84]  I think you guys can figure it out.
[4736.00 --> 4737.88]  This is going to delay us like five minutes.
[4737.98 --> 4740.10]  Just call somebody and find out what the pixel count is.
[4740.64 --> 4744.88]  And the DP who was shooting it after they like stormed off,
[4744.90 --> 4745.54]  cause it was kind of,
[4745.58 --> 4746.36]  it got kind of heated.
[4746.56 --> 4747.02]  And I was like,
[4747.02 --> 4747.80]  I'm not going to do it.
[4747.88 --> 4749.22]  I need you guys to figure this out.
[4749.44 --> 4751.20]  The DP leans over and he's like,
[4752.00 --> 4752.94]  look,
[4753.20 --> 4754.92]  I'm on their payroll today,
[4755.40 --> 4757.28]  but good job.
[4758.14 --> 4763.52]  Never shoot something that you don't believe that you don't want to do.
[4763.54 --> 4765.54]  to be used because they'll use it.
[4766.12 --> 4766.54]  Based.
[4766.82 --> 4767.92]  And because that's the thing,
[4767.96 --> 4768.12]  right?
[4768.16 --> 4770.42]  It's my contract entitles them to everything.
[4770.52 --> 4771.42]  I shot that day.
[4771.50 --> 4773.84]  I didn't get it in writing that they wouldn't use it.
[4773.84 --> 4775.50]  So like from a legal standpoint,
[4775.50 --> 4777.94]  unless I can prove we had that conversation.
[4778.60 --> 4779.28]  Absolutely will.
[4779.44 --> 4779.62]  Yeah.
[4779.72 --> 4780.06]  It's not,
[4780.12 --> 4780.50]  it's not,
[4780.62 --> 4786.24]  it's either not binding or it's not worth me pursuing at that point.
[4786.34 --> 4790.30]  The easier thing to do is to just never shoot it.
[4791.56 --> 4792.96]  So long story short,
[4792.96 --> 4794.22]  long story short,
[4794.54 --> 4797.42]  the brand got it all figured out and it turned out their talking points were fine.
[4797.74 --> 4797.98]  Sure.
[4798.26 --> 4798.90]  It doesn't matter though.
[4798.98 --> 4799.98]  But I just needed to know.
[4800.04 --> 4800.56]  It's the principle.
[4800.70 --> 4801.44]  I needed to know.
[4802.02 --> 4802.80]  And so,
[4802.90 --> 4804.18]  so coming back to your question,
[4804.34 --> 4806.66]  everything I said in the video was true.
[4807.06 --> 4808.46]  I have been using them.
[4808.52 --> 4810.30]  I haven't been using them every single night.
[4810.56 --> 4813.76]  There are definitely advantages to my regular AirPods pros.
[4814.10 --> 4814.42]  In fact,
[4814.42 --> 4815.92]  I used my AirPods pros last night.
[4815.98 --> 4817.32]  They're just convenient because I don't,
[4817.44 --> 4819.16]  there's no pairing process or anything like that.
[4819.16 --> 4819.98]  However,
[4820.18 --> 4820.88]  with that said,
[4821.30 --> 4827.46]  my AirPods pros fell out last night and I woke up and then I woke up really early this morning and they were dead.
[4827.56 --> 4828.94]  So I couldn't put anything back on.
[4829.12 --> 4832.90]  So the sleep buds would have fixed both of those problems.
[4832.90 --> 4837.38]  If I had put in the effort as I was going to bed of bothering to pair them and put them in.
[4837.76 --> 4838.12]  So,
[4838.22 --> 4838.42]  uh,
[4838.42 --> 4838.60]  yeah,
[4838.70 --> 4838.90]  no,
[4838.98 --> 4839.22]  they're,
[4839.32 --> 4840.08]  they're pretty sweet.
[4840.40 --> 4841.66]  As for the,
[4841.76 --> 4842.52]  however many,
[4842.70 --> 4843.06]  what was it?
[4843.10 --> 4845.86]  You said 14 million views on the announcement.
[4846.12 --> 4848.04]  What was this?
[4848.90 --> 4849.26]  Uh,
[4849.34 --> 4851.36]  hold on.
[4851.40 --> 4851.90]  I can't even,
[4852.04 --> 4853.58]  I can't even find this video.
[4854.58 --> 4856.08]  Oslo sleep.
[4856.08 --> 4856.36]  I,
[4856.36 --> 4860.84]  I do not see anything with 21 million views.
[4860.96 --> 4861.08]  Oh,
[4861.14 --> 4861.90]  here it is.
[4861.90 --> 4862.60]  Nevermind.
[4862.70 --> 4863.02]  Popular.
[4863.62 --> 4863.98]  Okay.
[4864.82 --> 4866.88]  So this channel has,
[4866.98 --> 4867.32]  uh,
[4867.46 --> 4869.24]  1000 subscribers.
[4870.20 --> 4870.76]  Um,
[4871.06 --> 4873.82]  this video is from 11 months ago,
[4873.82 --> 4878.32]  has 21 million views and has 12 comments.
[4878.46 --> 4878.68]  Yeah.
[4879.04 --> 4879.34]  So,
[4879.72 --> 4881.00]  so these are paid views.
[4881.52 --> 4882.08]  Um,
[4882.08 --> 4884.40]  so that's how it has 21 million views,
[4884.40 --> 4886.02]  which is fine.
[4886.22 --> 4886.56]  You say that.
[4886.62 --> 4888.94]  I think a lot of people are going to interpret that as bought it views.
[4889.02 --> 4889.44]  Oh no,
[4889.70 --> 4892.56]  not that he means it was ran as an advertisement on YouTube.
[4892.76 --> 4892.92]  Yeah.
[4893.22 --> 4895.58]  And when a advertisement is ran on YouTube,
[4895.58 --> 4898.72]  there is a video that you can go find that it actually is.
[4898.76 --> 4899.04]  It's,
[4899.04 --> 4899.08]  it's,
[4899.24 --> 4901.92]  they're really just playing a YouTube video before your YouTube video.
[4902.02 --> 4903.68]  So you can find the ad.
[4903.78 --> 4904.58]  That's the ad.
[4905.14 --> 4905.58]  Um,
[4905.58 --> 4907.76]  but people don't comment on the ad.
[4908.26 --> 4910.34]  So there's almost no comments on the video.
[4910.74 --> 4911.00]  In fact,
[4911.00 --> 4914.38]  I can show you guys a really fun example of how that works.
[4914.40 --> 4914.76]  Because,
[4914.76 --> 4915.64]  uh,
[4915.64 --> 4920.60]  that video that Elijah and I worked on for Yvonne's movie night in the pool,
[4920.72 --> 4921.20]  uh,
[4921.20 --> 4924.02]  the analytics look super funky for it.
[4924.06 --> 4924.54]  Oh no.
[4925.28 --> 4925.56]  Oh,
[4925.58 --> 4926.00]  that's right.
[4926.02 --> 4929.22]  You can't go back and look at historical real time.
[4929.34 --> 4929.74]  Oh,
[4930.30 --> 4930.72]  okay.
[4930.82 --> 4931.30]  Well,
[4932.42 --> 4932.78]  shoot.
[4932.96 --> 4933.10]  Yeah.
[4933.10 --> 4933.48]  It's been,
[4933.60 --> 4934.20]  it's been too,
[4934.40 --> 4934.68]  Oh,
[4934.78 --> 4935.44]  I might have a,
[4935.70 --> 4936.60]  did I take a screenshot?
[4938.04 --> 4938.44]  No,
[4938.50 --> 4939.42]  I didn't take a screenshot.
[4939.58 --> 4939.76]  Okay.
[4939.86 --> 4939.98]  Well,
[4939.98 --> 4940.80]  people showed me,
[4940.86 --> 4942.46]  but I think it was live on their phone.
[4942.50 --> 4946.22]  The real time view used to look like a really high spike.
[4946.46 --> 4947.84]  And then it went like this.
[4948.46 --> 4949.00]  And then it went,
[4949.10 --> 4952.26]  and then like another decay.
[4952.44 --> 4952.90]  And then went,
[4952.96 --> 4954.26]  and then it went like,
[4954.34 --> 4955.68]  flat like this.
[4955.68 --> 4956.80]  That is not normal.
[4956.98 --> 4958.38]  Normally when you first release a video,
[4958.48 --> 4960.28]  it starts high and then it kind of just tapers out.
[4960.48 --> 4961.34]  And then over time,
[4961.42 --> 4962.68]  eventually it might kind of,
[4962.76 --> 4962.92]  you know,
[4962.94 --> 4964.58]  have some spikes and dips and that kind of thing.
[4964.92 --> 4965.14]  Uh,
[4965.14 --> 4969.36]  but instead this followed a super weird curve compared to our typical,
[4969.52 --> 4970.62]  you can actually see,
[4970.72 --> 4971.28]  uh,
[4971.28 --> 4971.90]  here.
[4973.14 --> 4973.78]  There you go.
[4973.88 --> 4976.56]  You can kind of see this was it petering out.
[4976.82 --> 4979.86]  And this was the first ad spend that Hisense did.
[4980.06 --> 4981.60]  And then it tapers off a little bit.
[4981.66 --> 4983.02]  And then here's some more ad spend.
[4983.08 --> 4983.96]  And then they stopped.
[4983.96 --> 4989.66]  So it actually reports as normal views in your dashboard,
[4989.66 --> 4995.96]  but you can see this estimated revenue is more reflective of a video that got like a million and a half views,
[4996.12 --> 4998.52]  not 3.8 million views.
[4998.60 --> 5001.40]  So those extra views compared to usual.
[5001.64 --> 5002.46]  So it did well.
[5002.60 --> 5004.60]  We're purchased views from Hisense.
[5004.76 --> 5005.90]  It didn't do as well as it looks.
[5006.16 --> 5013.62]  And what's unfortunate is it kind of mucks with your analytics because this retention looks really bad because most people click off of
[5013.62 --> 5014.06]  ads.
[5014.92 --> 5015.44]  Um,
[5016.32 --> 5017.82]  so that's something,
[5018.46 --> 5018.98]  um,
[5019.32 --> 5021.62]  which I think might,
[5022.00 --> 5025.54]  we also noticed channel performance went down a little bit after this video.
[5025.54 --> 5026.34]  like,
[5026.34 --> 5029.90]  I think that may impact like our,
[5030.00 --> 5031.82]  our like channel momentum and stuff too.
[5031.92 --> 5033.28]  So we don't really have,
[5033.38 --> 5040.20]  I don't think we have a clear policy for whether someone is allowed to buy ads against our videos when they sponsor a video.
[5040.20 --> 5042.02]  But maybe that's something we'll have to look at.
[5042.08 --> 5044.62]  Cause it seems like by juicing this video,
[5044.62 --> 5047.86]  we got a lot of like abandonment of this video.
[5047.86 --> 5050.72]  And given that they're going to be targeting our demographic,
[5050.72 --> 5054.08]  if that counts as abandonment of LTT videos,
[5054.08 --> 5056.96]  that might mean that it's less likely to serve them the next ones,
[5057.02 --> 5058.02]  which is like legit,
[5058.20 --> 5059.42]  except that it was an ad.
[5059.50 --> 5062.18]  It wasn't a video that they navigated to.
[5062.38 --> 5065.14]  So it kind of makes sense because I expected the case video to do better.
[5065.14 --> 5068.00]  And I expected the secret shop in my own store video to kind of kill.
[5068.22 --> 5070.12]  So we might have to ask brand.
[5070.20 --> 5070.30]  Oh,
[5070.34 --> 5071.90]  you know what we could do is we could have a,
[5072.08 --> 5077.38]  like a garbage channel and we can ask brands to use the like garbage channel version of the video.
[5078.10 --> 5078.50]  Um,
[5078.78 --> 5078.94]  Dan,
[5078.94 --> 5082.14]  do you mind actually sending just a note to,
[5082.14 --> 5083.36]  uh,
[5083.42 --> 5083.76]  actually,
[5083.88 --> 5084.20]  uh,
[5084.76 --> 5087.34]  me and I'll follow that up next week.
[5087.38 --> 5088.84]  I'll suggest that to the business team.
[5088.92 --> 5091.12]  Cause then would you like it scheduled or do you want me to send it to you?
[5091.18 --> 5091.30]  Oh,
[5091.30 --> 5092.04]  just whenever it doesn't matter.
[5092.04 --> 5092.16]  Okay.
[5092.58 --> 5092.74]  Yeah.
[5092.74 --> 5094.36]  My inbox is basically my to-do list.
[5095.14 --> 5095.74]  Um,
[5096.36 --> 5096.62]  yeah,
[5096.64 --> 5098.72]  we know the intro is cringe black smoke rise.
[5098.80 --> 5099.50]  It was on purpose.
[5102.68 --> 5103.12]  It,
[5103.20 --> 5103.48]  uh,
[5103.50 --> 5103.72]  yeah.
[5103.74 --> 5108.22]  Apparently spiffing Brit did a video on this and serving a video as an ad does affect it in the algorithm.
[5109.16 --> 5109.60]  Oh,
[5109.70 --> 5109.92]  I,
[5109.92 --> 5109.98]  I,
[5110.02 --> 5112.14]  I understand it will affect that video,
[5112.14 --> 5121.28]  but what I'm wondering channel is whether it affects the profile of that viewer that abandoned an LTT video and makes it less likely to serve them LTT.
[5121.74 --> 5124.24]  Cause given how hard fought,
[5124.24 --> 5133.16]  like how hard one momentum like that is to lose any of it over something like this feels just unnecessary and frustrating.
[5133.40 --> 5134.88]  I don't know that it did.
[5135.34 --> 5135.68]  Um,
[5136.68 --> 5137.08]  but,
[5137.08 --> 5138.30]  uh,
[5138.30 --> 5139.32]  silicoid says,
[5139.40 --> 5140.62]  how cold was it actually in the pool?
[5140.66 --> 5142.84]  It seemed you guys were really in there for a while.
[5142.98 --> 5143.30]  Um,
[5143.30 --> 5144.56]  the pool was great.
[5145.24 --> 5149.78]  Being the top half of us being outside the pool was miserable.
[5149.78 --> 5150.24]  In fact,
[5150.24 --> 5151.88]  I'd never experienced this before,
[5151.88 --> 5157.96]  but with how cold my skin got outside the pool and like rain and cold,
[5157.96 --> 5160.18]  when I finally did jump into the pool,
[5160.22 --> 5161.00]  which was still heated,
[5161.00 --> 5163.28]  it was crazy.
[5163.28 --> 5163.72]  Cause you know,
[5163.72 --> 5165.78]  we keep our pool like quite warm for a pool,
[5165.78 --> 5167.48]  but it was still pool temperature,
[5167.48 --> 5168.14]  but I got in,
[5168.18 --> 5168.86]  it felt like a hot tub.
[5169.12 --> 5170.50]  Cause I've never tried that before.
[5170.50 --> 5172.92]  So that's a thing that,
[5172.92 --> 5173.40]  uh,
[5173.42 --> 5173.94]  if you've,
[5174.06 --> 5175.74]  if you've like done that before,
[5175.74 --> 5176.34]  you'll know,
[5176.44 --> 5177.22]  but now I know.
[5177.46 --> 5177.92]  For a few months,
[5177.98 --> 5178.64]  I was doing hot,
[5178.72 --> 5181.20]  cold cycles and wow.
[5181.34 --> 5181.68]  Yeah.
[5182.00 --> 5183.44]  I would imagine that would be painful.
[5183.82 --> 5185.38]  Cause if a pool felt like a hot tub,
[5185.44 --> 5187.60]  a hot type tub would have been like pretty unpleasant.
[5187.60 --> 5188.70]  I would think it was,
[5188.84 --> 5189.18]  uh,
[5189.18 --> 5190.98]  it wasn't a hot tub.
[5191.08 --> 5191.62]  It was a sauna,
[5191.62 --> 5193.10]  but yeah,
[5193.10 --> 5193.60]  it was hot.
[5194.02 --> 5194.88]  It was really hot.
[5195.84 --> 5197.24]  It was a cold bath in a sauna.
[5197.72 --> 5199.28]  Apparently with spiffing Brit's video,
[5199.28 --> 5202.38]  you purposely placed the worst audience and interests,
[5202.52 --> 5202.96]  i.e.
[5203.72 --> 5206.20]  senior book readers on a video game video,
[5206.34 --> 5210.72]  and that'll nuke all the channels analytics after the spike from ad serving.
[5211.08 --> 5211.56]  Oh,
[5211.68 --> 5212.16]  interesting.
[5212.52 --> 5213.16]  So yeah,
[5213.32 --> 5213.86]  maybe that,
[5213.98 --> 5215.02]  maybe we do need to do that.
[5215.10 --> 5215.38]  Okay,
[5215.48 --> 5215.70]  cool.
[5215.76 --> 5215.88]  Well,
[5215.88 --> 5216.32]  we'll get that.
[5216.40 --> 5218.68]  We'll get that sorted out and we won't do that again.
[5219.08 --> 5219.48]  Yoikes.
[5221.70 --> 5224.74]  Want to talk about McDonald's soft serve machines?
[5225.26 --> 5225.74]  Yeah.
[5225.74 --> 5226.30]  Cause I,
[5226.38 --> 5226.78]  uh,
[5226.78 --> 5229.14]  I had read an article on this already,
[5229.28 --> 5230.42]  and it was misleading.
[5230.68 --> 5231.86]  I have read our notes now,
[5231.86 --> 5233.34]  and I now understand what's going on.
[5233.46 --> 5234.94]  What I said at the beginning of the show was wrong.
[5235.44 --> 5239.20]  In response to a petition from iFixit and nonprofit public interest group,
[5239.30 --> 5240.04]  Public Knowledge,
[5240.48 --> 5240.96]  the U.S.
[5241.02 --> 5247.20]  Copyright Office has granted a partial exemption to the DMCA that allows restaurant owners to
[5247.20 --> 5249.68]  diagnose and repair their own equipment.
[5249.68 --> 5256.08]  And where Luke got a little bit confused and maybe it goes to show you how full of misinformation
[5256.08 --> 5257.32]  the internet can be these days.
[5257.32 --> 5260.88]  I read an article that said the partial exemption was for McDonald's.
[5261.68 --> 5261.96]  Yeah.
[5262.36 --> 5262.58]  Yeah.
[5262.66 --> 5263.06]  Like I,
[5263.26 --> 5263.74]  yeah.
[5263.90 --> 5264.30]  Anyway.
[5264.76 --> 5265.16]  Um,
[5265.22 --> 5265.48]  so,
[5265.60 --> 5266.58]  so Luke kind of thought,
[5266.68 --> 5266.80]  oh,
[5266.84 --> 5269.08]  this is like what to help pad McDonald's pockets.
[5269.30 --> 5269.74]  No.
[5270.18 --> 5270.96]  In fact,
[5270.96 --> 5272.74]  this is to go against if you,
[5272.86 --> 5273.46]  if man,
[5273.46 --> 5276.24]  the McDonald's soft serve machines are such a rabbit hole.
[5276.38 --> 5276.98]  It's fascinating.
[5276.98 --> 5278.32]  It is actually very interesting.
[5278.48 --> 5279.06]  Very interesting.
[5279.20 --> 5279.32]  Yeah.
[5279.46 --> 5287.04]  But what this does instead is it actually removes the incentive for McDonald's corporate and their
[5287.04 --> 5288.74]  partners to,
[5288.74 --> 5290.28]  um,
[5290.34 --> 5297.38]  not allow franchise owners to repair their own equipment because it turns out those service
[5297.38 --> 5300.14]  calls are extremely lucrative.
[5300.42 --> 5303.10]  And if they let them repair their own equipment,
[5303.10 --> 5305.50]  it could be done cheaply and faster,
[5305.50 --> 5309.74]  which means more chili treats for you in the summer,
[5309.86 --> 5311.98]  since the machines will be far less likely to be broken.
[5312.84 --> 5313.12]  Um,
[5313.12 --> 5319.50]  and it mostly impacts franchise owners who a lot of the time are not huge corporate fat
[5319.50 --> 5319.82]  cats.
[5319.94 --> 5323.66]  They are people who have a lot of their monthly revenue,
[5323.66 --> 5324.32]  uh,
[5324.32 --> 5326.80]  being paid to the huge corporate fat cats,
[5326.82 --> 5329.40]  but actually are just in the restaurant business,
[5329.40 --> 5331.76]  which can be a very challenging business.
[5332.28 --> 5332.72]  Um,
[5333.10 --> 5336.00]  so this decision is a blow to Taylor,
[5336.00 --> 5337.74]  the manufacturer of these machines,
[5337.74 --> 5341.86]  which has historically made a large part of its income from repair calls and has fought
[5341.86 --> 5345.62]  third party attempts to repair its purposely finicky machines.
[5345.62 --> 5350.68]  That's a big part of the rabbit hole is that it does appear as though the machines are intentionally
[5350.68 --> 5354.04]  obtuse and difficult to deal with.
[5354.04 --> 5356.04]  Sick.
[5356.44 --> 5356.84]  Yeah.
[5356.84 --> 5356.94]  Yeah.
[5357.14 --> 5358.58]  I'm freaking love it.
[5358.68 --> 5359.06]  Very good.
[5359.16 --> 5359.26]  Yeah.
[5359.26 --> 5360.58]  There's lots of good videos.
[5360.76 --> 5360.84]  Uh,
[5360.84 --> 5363.80]  people in the chat are recommending Matt Pat's video on it.
[5363.90 --> 5364.34]  Um,
[5364.38 --> 5364.48]  the,
[5364.56 --> 5366.36]  the whole ice cream machine fiasco.
[5366.54 --> 5366.94]  Um,
[5366.94 --> 5367.34]  I've seen,
[5367.50 --> 5368.78]  I've seen other good ones.
[5368.84 --> 5370.00]  I wish I could remember right now,
[5370.00 --> 5371.38]  but there's definitely really good ones.
[5371.38 --> 5372.66]  You know,
[5372.70 --> 5373.10]  this is a,
[5373.16 --> 5373.94]  this is weird aside,
[5374.00 --> 5374.70]  but I was talking to my brother,
[5374.76 --> 5376.16]  my brother's a firefighter and,
[5376.16 --> 5376.92]  uh,
[5376.94 --> 5377.64]  they cook.
[5377.80 --> 5378.72]  It's like a,
[5378.72 --> 5379.70]  a culture thing.
[5379.72 --> 5380.00]  They,
[5380.14 --> 5381.54]  they cook all their own meals.
[5381.54 --> 5382.64]  So the,
[5382.68 --> 5385.90]  the kitchen in the fire hall is like really important.
[5385.90 --> 5386.24]  The,
[5386.32 --> 5386.46]  the,
[5386.52 --> 5386.64]  you know,
[5386.64 --> 5386.80]  the,
[5386.84 --> 5390.28]  the people that are on probation have to make muffins all the time and all this kind
[5390.28 --> 5390.54]  of stuff.
[5390.54 --> 5395.14]  And you're expected to like actually be able to cook pretty well because it's going to
[5395.14 --> 5399.36]  cycle around who's cooking and you're cooking all the meals for all the firefighters that
[5399.36 --> 5400.26]  are on shift that day.
[5400.26 --> 5400.46]  Right.
[5400.48 --> 5400.70]  Yeah.
[5400.70 --> 5401.78]  And it rotates who does it.
[5401.78 --> 5402.22]  So you're like,
[5402.22 --> 5404.88]  you're actually expected to like know what you're doing and be pretty good.
[5404.88 --> 5406.28]  Like he was practicing at home.
[5406.88 --> 5407.32]  Um,
[5407.60 --> 5411.52]  they have special ovens that will turn off when they,
[5411.54 --> 5412.86]  they get fire calls.
[5413.14 --> 5413.32]  Oh,
[5413.34 --> 5414.08]  that's super cool.
[5414.42 --> 5415.84]  It's like kind of sick actually.
[5416.24 --> 5418.24]  So clearly they,
[5418.48 --> 5424.66]  they have this other problem where the like control panel or something is where all the
[5424.66 --> 5425.40]  steam comes out.
[5425.78 --> 5428.60]  So the control panel like fries itself constantly,
[5428.60 --> 5432.94]  but then they like have to use that one oven cause it turns itself off when the,
[5433.36 --> 5434.34]  so it's like,
[5434.34 --> 5435.12]  ah,
[5435.26 --> 5437.30]  anyways,
[5437.76 --> 5438.02]  uh,
[5438.02 --> 5439.58]  there's a lot of good comments about this,
[5439.60 --> 5439.78]  uh,
[5439.78 --> 5441.96]  clapped for 24 accord,
[5442.70 --> 5444.40]  clapped K 24 accord.
[5444.52 --> 5444.60]  Okay.
[5444.62 --> 5445.02]  It doesn't matter.
[5445.32 --> 5445.56]  Uh,
[5445.56 --> 5446.24]  the point is,
[5446.26 --> 5446.42]  uh,
[5446.42 --> 5449.78]  they said fast food equipment in general is ridiculous to repair way too expensive.
[5450.04 --> 5450.46]  Uh,
[5450.46 --> 5454.22]  apparently it's $3,500 to replace a control unit in a Tim Hortons oven.
[5454.60 --> 5455.04]  Um,
[5455.04 --> 5455.64]  this is all,
[5455.76 --> 5456.76]  this is all hearsay.
[5456.76 --> 5457.68]  Um,
[5458.76 --> 5459.30]  and then,
[5459.30 --> 5459.80]  uh,
[5460.10 --> 5460.64]  uh,
[5460.70 --> 5462.50]  Nipolis cage says,
[5462.64 --> 5467.76]  I work maintenance for corporate seven 11 and the maintenance game is bullshit.
[5468.24 --> 5469.68]  They've been in full plane chat forever.
[5469.86 --> 5470.30]  It's any,
[5470.44 --> 5472.06]  any time someone says their name,
[5472.14 --> 5472.56]  it's just like,
[5472.68 --> 5472.86]  what?
[5473.54 --> 5474.34]  Wiz tick says,
[5474.34 --> 5475.96]  I'm high as fuck.
[5476.04 --> 5476.92]  I love float plane.
[5476.98 --> 5477.86]  You guys are awesome.
[5479.06 --> 5480.26]  Maybe a little unrelated.
[5480.46 --> 5480.88]  Same here.
[5482.76 --> 5483.66]  You're on shift.
[5484.00 --> 5484.34]  Oh no.
[5484.68 --> 5484.82]  Oh,
[5484.88 --> 5485.04]  yeah.
[5485.42 --> 5485.64]  Oh,
[5485.74 --> 5485.96]  yeah.
[5486.62 --> 5486.66]  Um,
[5486.66 --> 5488.72]  this is actually a perfect segue.
[5489.10 --> 5489.46]  So,
[5489.70 --> 5490.02]  you know,
[5490.44 --> 5493.28]  having a little bit of healthy skepticism when you read something on the internet,
[5493.28 --> 5496.88]  I should have had more skepticism last week.
[5496.98 --> 5497.28]  Oh yeah.
[5497.28 --> 5500.96]  We've got an update on the Congo attack ad.
[5500.96 --> 5506.32]  So remember that thing last week where the teacher supposedly was blaming me for,
[5506.32 --> 5509.26]  for resource mining or whatever else.
[5509.86 --> 5510.32]  Um,
[5511.48 --> 5511.92]  yeah,
[5512.06 --> 5527.04]  we have since learned via a post from a second student that was in the same class that that was a mock-up example in immediate literacy assignment where students were expected to make similar pretend attack ads.
[5527.04 --> 5530.94]  The teacher describes himself as a big LTT fan,
[5531.28 --> 5536.16]  which is how he became aware that his attack ad had escaped his classroom,
[5536.36 --> 5538.96]  which was the only place it was intended to be seen.
[5539.06 --> 5539.62]  So unfortunate.
[5539.94 --> 5543.48]  We have gotten in contact with the teacher in question and asked them,
[5543.58 --> 5543.74]  Hey,
[5544.06 --> 5547.26]  do you want an opportunity to tell your side of the story?
[5547.26 --> 5552.98]  And he graciously agreed to send us a pre-recorded video statement.
[5553.16 --> 5555.46]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[5555.48 --> 5556.48]  Which is so cool.
[5556.56 --> 5562.92]  I was asked to create this video to respond to the Reddit post.
[5563.02 --> 5563.82]  So here I am.
[5564.88 --> 5567.66]  So I'm going to go ahead and read the statement that I wrote.
[5567.66 --> 5576.58]  A student recently took a photo of a lesson component out of context and posted it online where it was shared widely.
[5577.46 --> 5581.44]  The isolated image misrepresented the intent and content of the lesson,
[5582.08 --> 5585.50]  leading to a false and hurtful characterization of my views.
[5585.50 --> 5589.72]  The lesson was based on a poem by Derek Walcott's poem,
[5589.96 --> 5590.52]  Elsewhere,
[5590.90 --> 5594.74]  and focused on highlighting atrocities happening around the world.
[5595.68 --> 5598.74]  Then students were asked to create political attack ads,
[5598.92 --> 5600.94]  bringing awareness to said atrocities.
[5601.38 --> 5603.20]  To illustrate these concepts,
[5603.42 --> 5605.12]  I created an example ad,
[5605.70 --> 5607.98]  which the student then posted online.
[5607.98 --> 5613.60]  It's crucial to understand that this example was for illustrative purposes only.
[5614.20 --> 5616.52]  It did not reflect my personal views.
[5617.38 --> 5622.16]  Linus himself is really good at encouraging people to buy used and refurbished electronics
[5622.16 --> 5626.60]  and isn't anywhere close to problematic MIs.
[5627.60 --> 5628.92]  He's the note nine goat.
[5630.04 --> 5632.38]  While the online post was anonymous,
[5633.28 --> 5636.40]  it has caused some significant distress for me.
[5636.40 --> 5642.94]  It's disheartening to see my work misconstrued and used to create a misleading narrative,
[5643.16 --> 5647.56]  especially since I'm a big LTT fan and watch the channel all the time,
[5648.08 --> 5651.28]  which is how I found out about this to begin with.
[5652.24 --> 5654.26]  So to put this whole thing to bed,
[5655.14 --> 5659.28]  I don't think Linus is solely responsible for what happened in the Congo.
[5660.34 --> 5662.38]  It was just an example.
[5663.20 --> 5663.78]  That's all.
[5664.28 --> 5664.88]  Signing out.
[5666.40 --> 5669.02]  What an absolute Chad.
[5669.12 --> 5670.94]  Okay, the version that he recorded
[5671.62 --> 5674.76]  is a little different from the written version that I read.
[5674.80 --> 5676.62]  Did it not have the note nine goat in it?
[5676.62 --> 5678.44]  He added some flavor.
[5680.64 --> 5682.26]  Honestly, I think like...
[5682.26 --> 5685.94]  And he added the bit at the end about how I'm not solely responsible for it.
[5685.94 --> 5688.24]  Which I also thought was pretty funny.
[5688.56 --> 5692.00]  I think it's a cool, engaging project to do.
[5692.00 --> 5692.66]  I don't know.
[5692.78 --> 5695.02]  He seems like he's probably a fantastic teacher.
[5695.22 --> 5695.36]  Yeah.
[5695.46 --> 5697.72]  Ninja Man away says, send that man some merch.
[5697.80 --> 5699.48]  Yeah, I think we need to get him a package.
[5699.60 --> 5701.12]  I think we need to get him a care package.
[5701.26 --> 5706.48]  Dan, do you mind noting that down as something to maybe flag that for Mr. AP,
[5706.72 --> 5708.12]  speaking of people who are goaded,
[5708.62 --> 5712.54]  our customer care lead over at Creator Warehouse.
[5712.54 --> 5721.84]  Let's get something over to him because we clearly need to make up for all the damage that we've done to the Congo.
[5722.36 --> 5729.54]  Honestly, in a way, it's a super success of the project.
[5729.54 --> 5733.42]  Because it showed the efficacy of this type of stuff.
[5733.52 --> 5734.04]  Absolutely.
[5734.40 --> 5737.08]  So like his lesson plan just worked like way too well.
[5737.18 --> 5737.36]  Yeah.
[5737.44 --> 5748.44]  He demonstrated how powerful outrage culture can be and how much reach something can have when it elicits such an emotional response in the viewer.
[5748.72 --> 5748.90]  Yeah.
[5749.20 --> 5749.78]  Yeah.
[5749.94 --> 5750.82]  Great job.
[5751.28 --> 5751.92]  Great job.
[5752.26 --> 5754.84]  I'd love to send him something like super cool.
[5754.84 --> 5759.80]  Like maybe we could get him, we have a handful of photo samples of the new backpack.
[5760.42 --> 5760.68]  Oh.
[5761.40 --> 5761.80]  I don't know.
[5761.86 --> 5764.90]  I don't know if they're going to let me have any of those, but we'll put something together.
[5765.62 --> 5765.82]  Yeah.
[5766.00 --> 5767.40]  The commuter bag.
[5767.56 --> 5768.10]  Oh, okay.
[5768.22 --> 5768.34]  Okay.
[5768.48 --> 5768.64]  Yeah.
[5768.78 --> 5768.96]  Yeah.
[5768.96 --> 5769.18]  Yeah.
[5769.18 --> 5769.28]  Yeah.
[5769.28 --> 5770.88]  I was like, are you leaking something here?
[5770.94 --> 5771.50]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5771.50 --> 5771.72]  Okay.
[5771.84 --> 5772.00]  Okay.
[5772.12 --> 5772.62]  I don't know.
[5772.66 --> 5773.34]  We'll figure something out.
[5773.40 --> 5774.16]  We'll figure something out.
[5774.18 --> 5774.38]  Okay.
[5774.46 --> 5775.30]  We'll figure something out.
[5775.34 --> 5779.38]  But it'd be cool to get him something like, like one of one or something that's like, you know,
[5779.44 --> 5781.00]  early or something, something cool.
[5781.28 --> 5782.08]  I just think it's cool.
[5782.08 --> 5783.44]  Cause like, I mean, I don't know.
[5783.44 --> 5784.34]  Maybe we should all be used stuff.
[5784.50 --> 5786.54]  I had lots of stuff we didn't need anymore.
[5786.62 --> 5786.98]  I had.
[5787.18 --> 5789.68]  I don't want to hurt any more kids in the Congo.
[5790.06 --> 5790.46]  Yeah.
[5790.76 --> 5792.14]  That could be kind of cool.
[5792.24 --> 5796.54]  By the way, I have still been carrying the Note 9, even though I'm reviewing the iPhone.
[5796.54 --> 5800.76]  Is this type of thing what we could use the remaining Lambo beanies for?
[5801.58 --> 5802.36]  Ah, no.
[5802.78 --> 5802.98]  No?
[5803.18 --> 5804.22]  We have a plan for them.
[5804.34 --> 5804.46]  Okay.
[5804.54 --> 5804.72]  Okay.
[5804.72 --> 5805.00]  Cool.
[5805.14 --> 5805.34]  Yeah.
[5805.88 --> 5807.12]  It's not a great plan.
[5807.82 --> 5809.38]  I think it's, I think it's cool.
[5809.96 --> 5810.64]  I don't know.
[5810.64 --> 5813.16]  I had such a, and I think everybody does.
[5813.24 --> 5815.08]  I had such a range of teachers when I was going to school.
[5815.18 --> 5820.76]  I had the teacher that like would literally just sit there with the textbook and read it,
[5820.76 --> 5824.34]  or they would put scans of the textbook on the thing and just tell you to read it when
[5824.34 --> 5825.30]  you have the textbook.
[5825.50 --> 5828.76]  Like it's just, they might not, it might as well not even be there.
[5828.86 --> 5828.96]  Yeah.
[5828.96 --> 5830.48]  Like there's, there's no point in going to their class.
[5830.52 --> 5832.82]  We had one that literally wasn't there a lot of the time.
[5832.96 --> 5834.54]  He would go to the cafeteria.
[5834.54 --> 5838.64]  If you had the block before lunch, he would assign everyone silent reading.
[5838.64 --> 5843.04]  And this isn't like grade eight when you don't need to do silent reading in class.
[5843.24 --> 5843.30]  No.
[5843.48 --> 5848.60]  He would assign everyone to like read and he would disappear for like 20 minutes at a time
[5848.60 --> 5849.78]  out of a 50 minute block.
[5850.20 --> 5852.74]  And he'd go to the cafeteria and like sample food ahead of time.
[5852.74 --> 5854.86]  Cause he was like buddies with the people in the cafeteria.
[5855.06 --> 5856.02]  I was like, this is ridiculous.
[5856.24 --> 5856.84]  It is ridiculous.
[5856.84 --> 5861.34]  But then you have great teachers like, like this guy seems to be, that'll like go out
[5861.34 --> 5865.36]  of their way to create cool projects and engaging ways to like actually learn.
[5865.42 --> 5871.60]  Cause at least for me, when I was going to school, if it was just book work, like chance
[5871.60 --> 5873.42]  that's getting done is not super high.
[5873.94 --> 5880.28]  But if it was like some weird, engaging, different, not necessarily expected project way to engage
[5880.28 --> 5883.42]  with the learning in a different way, stuff like that, man, I would be all over that.
[5883.42 --> 5884.82]  So I don't know.
[5884.88 --> 5888.90]  This seems like a very creative assignment and I'm really glad that he was kind enough
[5888.90 --> 5894.28]  to put himself out there and come talk about, you know, how he actually felt like about
[5894.28 --> 5894.48]  that.
[5894.54 --> 5900.42]  You know, honestly, I think we, we probably haven't talked enough about how important
[5900.42 --> 5905.38]  it is to articulate the damage that this kind of cyber bullying can cause.
[5905.54 --> 5909.66]  I think he did a great job of just talking about like how it made him felt and what the
[5909.66 --> 5910.42]  impact was.
[5910.42 --> 5914.68]  You can tell this is someone that has a lot of experience, um, dealing with like
[5914.68 --> 5919.26]  assholes, which let's be honest, a lot of high schools or high schoolers are.
[5919.26 --> 5920.08]  It's a high school teacher.
[5920.08 --> 5927.10]  And like explaining in the simplest possible terms why like doing a bad thing is bad.
[5927.48 --> 5927.76]  Yeah.
[5928.00 --> 5930.62]  It was, it was well read and well read as well.
[5930.80 --> 5930.94]  Yeah.
[5930.94 --> 5931.18]  Yeah.
[5931.24 --> 5931.98]  Did a great job.
[5932.22 --> 5932.44]  Yeah.
[5932.88 --> 5933.64]  Uh, all right.
[5933.72 --> 5935.02]  What else do we got this week?
[5936.38 --> 5937.70]  Dan, what are we supposed to be doing?
[5938.38 --> 5939.18]  Instagram head.
[5939.18 --> 5939.50]  Yeah.
[5939.60 --> 5941.10]  I just don't run out the rest of your topics.
[5941.48 --> 5942.60]  Instagram head firms.
[5942.60 --> 5946.78]  They lower the quality of unpopular clips in a recent video.
[5946.90 --> 5952.52]  AMA head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri stated that the platform demotes unpopular clips to
[5952.52 --> 5954.38]  a lower level of video quality.
[5954.62 --> 5956.18]  However, this will reverse.
[5956.38 --> 5962.02]  If the video gains traction again, Mosseri claims that it is only a small bump in quality.
[5962.02 --> 5966.48]  It doesn't make competing harder for smaller creators.
[5966.66 --> 5966.80]  Okay.
[5967.18 --> 5967.98]  That makes sense.
[5968.20 --> 5968.80]  How would they know?
[5970.30 --> 5970.96]  I don't know.
[5972.24 --> 5973.46]  A really difficult thing to measure.
[5973.46 --> 5975.08]  Well, everyone would start as a small creator.
[5975.26 --> 5977.34]  So theoretically it's a level playing field, I guess.
[5977.56 --> 5977.88]  Fair enough.
[5978.12 --> 5981.18]  Well, no, but you know, also kind of.
[5981.28 --> 5982.32]  It's a free platform, guys.
[5982.40 --> 5984.50]  And at the end of the day, content is king.
[5984.50 --> 5989.16]  A difference in video quality on a platform like Instagram, where quite frankly, the video
[5989.16 --> 5990.30]  looks like butt anyway.
[5990.90 --> 5991.48]  No one cares.
[5993.58 --> 5993.94]  Unfortunately.
[5994.32 --> 5995.18]  I wish they did.
[5995.38 --> 5996.54]  Floatplane would do better if they did.
[5996.66 --> 5997.30]  They don't.
[5997.48 --> 5998.16]  It is what it is.
[5998.16 --> 6001.10]  Our discussion question is, would you do the same if you were in their position?
[6001.74 --> 6002.46]  Yeah, probably.
[6002.60 --> 6002.84]  All right.
[6003.08 --> 6003.52]  See you later.
[6003.94 --> 6004.96]  What else we got for today?
[6005.32 --> 6005.72]  It's a free.
[6005.98 --> 6006.18]  Like.
[6006.46 --> 6007.40]  Dan won't be telling us.
[6008.02 --> 6013.74]  What I would especially do is really old clips that haven't been accessed in a long
[6013.74 --> 6013.96]  time.
[6014.50 --> 6015.74]  Oh, that's definitely a thing.
[6015.96 --> 6016.18]  Yeah.
[6016.64 --> 6020.50]  Like you go back like way far back on like your Facebook timeline or whatever, and you
[6020.50 --> 6021.96]  like try to like open a photo.
[6022.10 --> 6022.84]  It takes a second.
[6023.34 --> 6024.44]  Oh, but that's not necessarily.
[6024.44 --> 6025.42]  You can tell it's grabbing off a hard drive.
[6025.70 --> 6025.96]  Yeah.
[6026.10 --> 6028.34]  But that's not necessarily the quality level of it.
[6028.34 --> 6030.26]  Oh, this is just bandwidth conservation.
[6030.50 --> 6030.80]  Yeah, sure.
[6030.92 --> 6031.10]  Yeah.
[6031.62 --> 6035.94]  Well, it's also probably affected by storage too, because anything higher quality or more
[6035.94 --> 6037.98]  viral is they're going to be caching it way nearer to you.
[6038.22 --> 6039.06]  It's on more expensive storage.
[6039.20 --> 6039.30]  Yeah.
[6039.30 --> 6040.66]  And yeah, yeah, yeah, that too.
[6042.14 --> 6046.82]  At the end of the day, architecting this stuff at the scale that they operate at is extremely
[6046.82 --> 6047.42]  complicated.
[6047.92 --> 6048.08]  Yeah.
[6048.12 --> 6054.38]  And little changes like this, which I actually believe, Adam Mosseri, it probably doesn't
[6054.38 --> 6056.40]  really make much of a difference to almost anybody.
[6056.76 --> 6062.38]  But who it is going to make a pretty big difference to is probably them when it comes to their bills.
[6062.84 --> 6065.50]  Like on the scale that Instagram is doing.
[6065.50 --> 6070.46]  This will probably save them tons, but it'll unlikely to make any real difference to users
[6070.46 --> 6070.94]  or creators.
[6071.22 --> 6074.32]  ScrappyDP asks, do old floatplane clips lose quality?
[6074.86 --> 6075.78]  The answer is no.
[6076.14 --> 6084.88]  Floatplane is not growing at or even targeting growing at the kind of exponential rate that
[6084.88 --> 6091.48]  your VC funded businesses slash big tech businesses are expecting.
[6091.48 --> 6106.04]  And so even though storage costs are only falling a little bit these days compared to how they used to, our storage costs and our storage needs are kind of doing okay.
[6106.44 --> 6109.08]  So we can maintain everything the way that it was.
[6109.08 --> 6118.02]  We do de-rank, like we have like ranks of storage, but not of quality effectively.
[6118.36 --> 6121.86]  So like if something's not accessed for a long time, it's going to fall back to hard drives.
[6121.98 --> 6127.28]  If something starts getting feverishly accessed, like a floatplane exclusive LTT thing or something
[6127.28 --> 6130.34]  like that, that'll sit in higher tier storage.
[6130.46 --> 6131.28]  So it can be pulled easier.
[6131.70 --> 6132.18]  Is what it is.
[6132.18 --> 6135.50]  Want to play some AI Minecraft?
[6136.46 --> 6136.86]  Yes.
[6138.62 --> 6141.40]  AI company Descartes has publicly released.
[6141.40 --> 6142.50]  It sounded like a duck call.
[6142.58 --> 6142.72]  Yeah.
[6142.76 --> 6143.02]  I don't know.
[6143.06 --> 6143.76]  My throat was weird.
[6145.02 --> 6151.08]  Has publicly released Oasis, which is a playable AI model trained on Minecraft.
[6151.84 --> 6155.38]  Currently, you can only play for a few minutes at most, and it's only playable on Chrome.
[6155.38 --> 6158.80]  The results are, description, trippy.
[6159.34 --> 6159.66]  Okay.
[6160.82 --> 6165.38]  Do you want to play or should I play or like, oh, I'm going to need a mouse probably.
[6165.52 --> 6166.08]  I mean, it's Minecraft.
[6166.36 --> 6167.14]  Give me a sec.
[6167.18 --> 6167.56]  I got one.
[6167.70 --> 6167.82]  Yeah.
[6167.84 --> 6168.04]  Okay.
[6168.86 --> 6169.48]  You play then.
[6170.32 --> 6171.64]  Do they call it?
[6172.16 --> 6172.56]  Ow.
[6173.30 --> 6174.94]  It's trained on Minecraft.
[6175.34 --> 6175.64]  Is this?
[6175.76 --> 6178.54]  Stupid metal board that Sammy had for the stupid.
[6178.56 --> 6178.98]  Yikes.
[6179.16 --> 6179.62]  Did it shin you?
[6179.62 --> 6180.92]  They just whacked me in the shin.
[6181.06 --> 6182.68]  Please don't get blood on the set.
[6182.68 --> 6188.08]  Dude, my head bled from the shoot I did yesterday with David.
[6188.20 --> 6191.20]  I stood up and I hit my head on his Borg computer.
[6191.60 --> 6191.94]  Oh.
[6192.72 --> 6195.34]  Those are words that'll make sense once you watch the video.
[6195.44 --> 6195.70]  Yeah.
[6195.76 --> 6196.06]  Okay.
[6201.68 --> 6204.04]  Zoo Cacu says Borg computer.
[6204.86 --> 6205.64]  Not Bork.
[6205.86 --> 6206.30]  Not Bork.
[6206.52 --> 6207.56]  Borg computer.
[6208.02 --> 6208.50]  Good, good, good.
[6208.50 --> 6216.68]  Dude, we did a bit of a different extreme upgrade or ultimate upgrade or, you know,
[6216.78 --> 6218.86]  whichever branding we're using for it right now.
[6220.82 --> 6222.20]  David paid for everything.
[6223.36 --> 6226.32]  So instead of having a sponsor for it, it's just.
[6226.54 --> 6227.26]  Oh, yeah.
[6227.40 --> 6228.62]  No, I like this idea.
[6229.08 --> 6229.30]  I think.
[6229.42 --> 6229.96]  It's just a video.
[6230.14 --> 6231.76]  We were talking about doing this at some point.
[6231.76 --> 6231.92]  Yeah.
[6232.02 --> 6237.50]  It's just a video where just like David's doing an upgrade any, excuse me, anyway, and
[6237.50 --> 6239.62]  we make a video about it.
[6239.86 --> 6241.20]  Get some labor.
[6241.40 --> 6248.22]  The quid pro quo was A, that I and Reese would like help him with it for the day.
[6248.28 --> 6249.20]  I think Reese, not Elijah.
[6249.98 --> 6251.28]  Maybe I'll go down this route.
[6251.92 --> 6252.22]  Yeah.
[6252.64 --> 6255.18]  You might not end up with too many extra holes in your house.
[6255.18 --> 6255.38]  Exactly.
[6255.48 --> 6255.72]  Yeah.
[6256.04 --> 6259.10]  So Reese and I were there for the day helping him with things.
[6259.10 --> 6264.18]  So like I built his SO's computer and, you know, helped with the mounting of his custom
[6264.18 --> 6267.14]  painted USS Enterprise and stuff like that.
[6267.76 --> 6274.08]  And, and also that we did that video promoting him selling his collection, which was actually,
[6274.30 --> 6277.16]  which got an extra exposure, which helped his budget.
[6277.16 --> 6282.80]  So it was like, and then in return, you know, he's giving us his space and, you know, his upgrade
[6282.80 --> 6286.70]  and he probably spent some money on things that he probably wouldn't have to make it a little
[6286.70 --> 6287.28]  more interesting.
[6287.28 --> 6287.60]  Anyway.
[6287.60 --> 6290.70]  Dude, I should, I should con you into painting my place.
[6291.28 --> 6293.04]  The space ends up super cool.
[6293.28 --> 6294.82]  I did no painting, which was nice.
[6295.46 --> 6298.76]  Um, and I hit my head.
[6299.32 --> 6304.42]  Oh, I forget where I was going with this, but in fairness to me, I recently hit my head.
[6304.82 --> 6306.48]  So anyway, Oasis.
[6307.48 --> 6307.92]  Okay.
[6308.70 --> 6309.54]  So it's muted.
[6309.90 --> 6315.42]  Oh, you are about to enter a first of its kind video model.
[6315.42 --> 6315.94]  Is there sound?
[6315.94 --> 6318.90]  A game engine trained by millions of gameplay hours.
[6319.32 --> 6319.66]  I think so.
[6319.66 --> 6323.44]  Every step you take will shape the environment around you in real time.
[6323.44 --> 6328.78]  So are they going to get sued to all crap?
[6332.50 --> 6332.96]  Hold on.
[6333.02 --> 6333.56]  I'm on it.
[6334.40 --> 6334.94]  Mute which one?
[6335.22 --> 6337.76]  Uh, there's a volume thing on the top left of Oasis.
[6338.16 --> 6339.06]  What are you talking about, Willis?
[6339.16 --> 6339.34]  Yeah.
[6339.50 --> 6339.88]  Mute that.
[6340.26 --> 6340.46]  Okay.
[6340.76 --> 6340.96]  Cool.
[6341.16 --> 6343.22]  So that is only coming from that then.
[6343.40 --> 6343.66]  Okay.
[6343.70 --> 6344.04]  So we're good.
[6344.12 --> 6345.88]  So if you make C unmute.
[6346.32 --> 6346.94]  Here we go, boys.
[6346.94 --> 6347.58]  This.
[6349.28 --> 6349.68]  Ooh.
[6349.68 --> 6350.06]  Ooh.
[6352.88 --> 6353.36]  Okay.
[6353.70 --> 6354.50]  What do you want?
[6354.64 --> 6356.06]  What do you all want to see?
[6357.32 --> 6357.84]  Um.
[6359.44 --> 6361.92]  Maybe we go for rugged coastline and just go BC.
[6362.42 --> 6362.86]  Okay.
[6362.86 --> 6368.10]  A sheer drop from towering peaks crumbling into the ocean below.
[6368.78 --> 6372.76]  Trees balance over the water and waves crash over rocks.
[6373.36 --> 6374.32]  Ready for adventure.
[6375.46 --> 6376.58]  Waiting for your turn.
[6376.70 --> 6377.62]  Written by AI.
[6379.30 --> 6379.56]  Oh.
[6380.24 --> 6380.56]  Um.
[6380.56 --> 6381.54]  Waiting for your turn?
[6381.80 --> 6382.16]  Dang it.
[6382.16 --> 6383.52]  Did all of y'all jump on here?
[6383.56 --> 6384.04]  Oh.
[6385.16 --> 6385.52]  Hold on.
[6385.52 --> 6385.80]  Hold on.
[6385.84 --> 6386.08]  Hold on.
[6386.14 --> 6387.26]  Positioning cue 29.
[6387.42 --> 6388.50]  ETA 12 seconds.
[6388.84 --> 6389.06]  Oh.
[6389.24 --> 6389.40]  Okay.
[6389.42 --> 6389.98]  We got this.
[6392.02 --> 6396.30]  Does the positioning cue go down?
[6396.48 --> 6396.84]  There it is.
[6396.84 --> 6397.06]  Nice.
[6397.30 --> 6397.58]  Nice.
[6397.58 --> 6398.22]  It's your turn.
[6399.52 --> 6400.22]  Do it.
[6406.02 --> 6406.46]  Okay.
[6407.84 --> 6408.20]  So.
[6408.20 --> 6409.18]  Can you press button?
[6409.32 --> 6411.40]  Like, can you select the different items that you have?
[6411.40 --> 6412.90]  I mean, I don't know.
[6413.92 --> 6415.14]  I'm just doing stuff here.
[6418.48 --> 6422.26]  Is it super laggy?
[6422.88 --> 6424.74]  Oh, it's definitely a little laggy.
[6424.78 --> 6424.98]  Yeah.
[6425.98 --> 6428.74]  What happens if you limit your frame of view and then look up?
[6430.74 --> 6431.32]  Hold on.
[6431.38 --> 6432.34]  I'm doing a thing here.
[6432.72 --> 6432.96]  Oh.
[6435.64 --> 6436.08]  Hmm.
[6436.26 --> 6436.70]  Okay.
[6436.70 --> 6438.04]  I don't think you are.
[6438.36 --> 6438.76]  Okay.
[6438.86 --> 6439.74]  So I look up.
[6439.96 --> 6440.20]  Oh, no.
[6440.20 --> 6442.28]  I meant like out in the world.
[6442.38 --> 6442.86]  Like, did it change?
[6442.96 --> 6443.30]  Yeah.
[6443.90 --> 6444.26]  Yeah.
[6444.26 --> 6445.00]  There you go.
[6445.98 --> 6446.64]  Trey's interesting.
[6447.02 --> 6448.54]  I don't think it's able to.
[6449.92 --> 6450.40]  Uh-huh.
[6450.56 --> 6450.80]  Yeah.
[6450.86 --> 6451.40]  So like, yeah.
[6451.50 --> 6451.90]  Stair away.
[6454.90 --> 6455.20]  Oh.
[6455.58 --> 6455.82]  Oh.
[6457.72 --> 6458.18]  Where'd it go?
[6458.72 --> 6458.88]  Oh.
[6458.88 --> 6459.00]  Oh.
[6459.00 --> 6459.56]  Oh.
[6459.56 --> 6459.86]  Oh.
[6459.86 --> 6459.90]  Oh.
[6459.90 --> 6460.08]  Oh.
[6460.08 --> 6460.14]  Oh.
[6460.14 --> 6460.20]  Oh.
[6462.20 --> 6462.38]  Oh.
[6462.38 --> 6462.44]  Oh.
[6462.44 --> 6462.48]  Oh.
[6462.48 --> 6462.52]  Oh.
[6462.52 --> 6462.58]  Oh.
[6462.58 --> 6462.60]  Oh.
[6462.60 --> 6462.66]  Oh.
[6462.66 --> 6462.70]  Oh.
[6462.70 --> 6462.76]  Oh.
[6462.76 --> 6462.78]  Oh.
[6462.78 --> 6462.82]  Oh.
[6462.82 --> 6462.88]  Oh.
[6462.88 --> 6462.96]  Oh.
[6462.96 --> 6463.02]  Oh.
[6463.02 --> 6463.08]  Oh.
[6463.08 --> 6463.10]  Oh.
[6463.10 --> 6463.16]  Oh.
[6463.16 --> 6463.22]  Oh.
[6463.22 --> 6463.66]  Oh.
[6463.66 --> 6463.70]  Oh.
[6463.70 --> 6463.76]  Oh.
[6463.76 --> 6463.78]  Oh.
[6463.78 --> 6463.82]  Oh.
[6463.82 --> 6463.88]  Oh.
[6463.88 --> 6464.26]  Oh.
[6464.26 --> 6468.34]  This is like your Minecraft game dropped attack.
[6468.34 --> 6468.60]  Yeah.
[6468.78 --> 6469.12]  Yeah.
[6469.12 --> 6469.18]  Yeah.
[6472.46 --> 6472.86]  Huh.
[6473.24 --> 6473.52]  Okay.
[6473.58 --> 6474.36]  What's going to be over this?
[6474.36 --> 6476.94]  Honestly, it makes the exploration kind of fun.
[6477.74 --> 6480.94]  Can I build a path for myself?
[6481.08 --> 6482.00]  Like, is that possible?
[6482.22 --> 6482.60]  Can I?
[6483.46 --> 6484.68]  Is that how this works?
[6484.72 --> 6485.84]  Is that how any of this works?
[6487.56 --> 6488.02]  Okay.
[6488.22 --> 6488.48]  Yeah.
[6489.16 --> 6490.06]  I can.
[6490.06 --> 6495.44]  Maybe with this, Starfield wouldn't have been a useless pile of junk.
[6496.20 --> 6496.56]  No.
[6497.04 --> 6497.40]  Okay.
[6497.40 --> 6497.42]  Oh.
[6497.74 --> 6498.12]  Okay.
[6498.48 --> 6499.16]  What's up there?
[6499.18 --> 6499.64]  What's up there?
[6499.64 --> 6500.68]  I want to get there.
[6500.68 --> 6502.16]  I want to see what's supposed to be there.
[6504.06 --> 6505.10]  Are you kidding me?
[6505.18 --> 6505.36]  Whoa.
[6505.42 --> 6505.98]  There's a structure.
[6506.32 --> 6506.62]  Whoa.
[6506.88 --> 6507.08]  Whoa.
[6507.16 --> 6507.42]  Am I?
[6507.98 --> 6508.16]  Whoa.
[6508.16 --> 6508.80]  Is that a village?
[6509.22 --> 6509.74]  Whoa, dude.
[6509.88 --> 6518.08]  I kept going up to like the, but I made my way away from the mountain that was, I was on.
[6518.14 --> 6518.70]  There's no look.
[6518.94 --> 6519.28]  Whoa.
[6520.06 --> 6521.74]  Like, did you see what happened there?
[6521.86 --> 6522.02]  Whoa.
[6522.22 --> 6523.64]  As you just turned, everything's changing.
[6523.72 --> 6524.18]  Yes, I did.
[6524.20 --> 6527.50]  I was climbing a mountain and looking up and it became just like whatever was in front
[6527.50 --> 6527.76]  of me.
[6527.84 --> 6530.00]  This is some inception kind of stuff, dude.
[6530.40 --> 6531.12]  Village gone.
[6531.72 --> 6533.08]  This is crazy.
[6534.52 --> 6538.34]  Who needs drugs when you can just play this game?
[6538.34 --> 6540.26]  Well, wait until they have this kind of stuff for VR.
[6542.16 --> 6542.56]  Wow.
[6542.72 --> 6542.94]  Okay.
[6543.02 --> 6543.76]  I think I've had enough.
[6543.98 --> 6544.40]  You'd be kind of right.
[6544.40 --> 6544.46]  All right.
[6544.76 --> 6553.18]  So, um, this is just a glimpse into the future of interactive AI experiences.
[6553.58 --> 6554.22]  What's next?
[6554.72 --> 6555.86]  Just imagine.
[6555.86 --> 6562.30]  As far as my understanding goes, they have it.
[6562.38 --> 6563.88]  They have some of it running on ASIC cards.
[6563.98 --> 6564.18]  Yeah.
[6564.18 --> 6564.24]  Yeah.
[6564.24 --> 6564.36]  Yeah.
[6564.36 --> 6570.04]  The playable model was made possible by super fast inference thanks to an ASIC card with
[6570.04 --> 6577.04]  the model's transformer architecture physically recreated on the chip by Deckard partner etched.
[6577.04 --> 6582.52]  Our discussion questions are, what do you think of the game?
[6582.98 --> 6586.92]  Well, I mean, it's obviously just Minecraft because it's trained on Minecraft.
[6587.48 --> 6589.30]  How close is it to actual Minecraft?
[6589.42 --> 6589.72]  It asks.
[6589.82 --> 6594.72]  I mean, in terms of like how it felt to play other than being super leggy, it like felt
[6594.72 --> 6595.34]  like Minecraft.
[6595.48 --> 6595.96]  Felt like Minecraft.
[6595.96 --> 6596.34]  Honestly.
[6596.44 --> 6596.56]  Yeah.
[6596.56 --> 6597.38]  Like the movement and everything.
[6597.44 --> 6598.72]  Does it take much to get you there?
[6599.88 --> 6601.60]  Um, maybe not.
[6601.86 --> 6602.66]  Maybe not that much.
[6603.00 --> 6604.60]  Jump attack is a hold button.
[6604.72 --> 6604.92]  Yep.
[6605.14 --> 6605.34]  Yeah.
[6605.40 --> 6606.26]  I didn't try to run.
[6606.26 --> 6607.96]  I guess I could have tried to do more things.
[6608.58 --> 6612.12]  Um, our next question though is how good is its object permanence?
[6612.12 --> 6616.82]  And there I would say things fall apart a little bit.
[6617.54 --> 6619.88]  That's the whole reason why the demo is fun.
[6620.36 --> 6621.58]  Um, yeah.
[6622.16 --> 6622.60]  Yeah.
[6622.66 --> 6626.88]  How bad it is, is, is sort of the most interesting thing about it.
[6626.94 --> 6627.76]  With that said.
[6627.84 --> 6629.58]  It's also kind of crazy.
[6630.16 --> 6632.10]  The fact that this exists at all.
[6632.18 --> 6632.46]  Yeah.
[6632.60 --> 6633.70]  With no game engine.
[6634.22 --> 6634.58]  Yeah.
[6634.70 --> 6635.42]  With no.
[6635.42 --> 6638.24]  Because it's, it's bad because it's not very playable.
[6638.82 --> 6639.02]  Yes.
[6639.02 --> 6641.28]  But it's also amazing because it exists.
[6642.64 --> 6643.08]  Yeah.
[6643.24 --> 6645.70]  The fact that this is a thing at all.
[6645.78 --> 6645.98]  Yeah.
[6646.20 --> 6648.48]  Is mind blowing.
[6649.24 --> 6656.00]  Um, with that said, it is very clear that we are an awful long way away from our GPUs just
[6656.00 --> 6657.82]  being neural processing units.
[6658.82 --> 6659.04]  Yeah.
[6659.04 --> 6665.46]  Um, and this being a gaming experience that, uh, that anyone would, would want.
[6665.78 --> 6666.12]  Yeah.
[6666.28 --> 6667.16]  I give it six months.
[6667.56 --> 6670.26]  Would it be kind of cool if that ended up being an add-in card though?
[6671.06 --> 6673.18]  I'd be down to go back to multiple add-in cards.
[6673.28 --> 6673.80]  That'd be sick.
[6673.92 --> 6674.04]  Yeah.
[6674.04 --> 6675.32]  Get your physics card in there.
[6675.38 --> 6675.58]  Yeah.
[6675.58 --> 6676.72]  Get your sound card in there.
[6676.82 --> 6678.06]  Get your neural card in there.
[6678.06 --> 6678.38]  Yeah.
[6678.38 --> 6686.44]  Well, if Nvidia has their way, the GPU will eventually morph into a neural, neural PU and
[6686.44 --> 6688.80]  then it'll just like have a GPU component on it.
[6688.80 --> 6690.80]  Cause you'll always like need to output.
[6691.38 --> 6694.82]  Um, and you'll always need to play legacy games and stuff like that.
[6694.82 --> 6698.04]  But pretty cool.
[6698.36 --> 6702.54]  Uh, lucky fall course says it's like the impossible staircase illusion with that mountain.
[6702.68 --> 6702.78]  Yeah.
[6702.80 --> 6705.76]  That was, that was trippy.
[6705.76 --> 6709.72]  Cause I was trying to look up the mountain and I made my way to like a landscape in front
[6709.72 --> 6710.16]  of me somehow.
[6710.16 --> 6710.98]  I was like, okay.
[6711.06 --> 6716.02]  I mean, yeah, I guess in, I guess there is no up in video games if you think about it.
[6716.02 --> 6718.08]  So why would it, right?
[6718.10 --> 6721.44]  Cause you could move a mouse up infinitely theoretically, right?
[6721.44 --> 6724.70]  Like there's no gravity in a video game.
[6725.32 --> 6727.66]  Like, like it's all, it's all, it's all artificial.
[6728.20 --> 6728.42]  Yeah.
[6728.48 --> 6734.16]  Like we create up and we create down, but, but this AI model is not constrained by that.
[6734.16 --> 6735.26]  What's up in real life.
[6735.92 --> 6736.32]  Exactly.
[6737.96 --> 6738.36]  Exactly.
[6738.44 --> 6740.76]  It's away from the center of the earth, but because.
[6740.88 --> 6742.26]  But what if you're not on the earth anymore?
[6742.62 --> 6743.20]  Where's up now?
[6743.44 --> 6744.52]  No, I just, what?
[6745.10 --> 6746.76]  No, I'm trying to make a point right now.
[6746.76 --> 6750.06]  Up in the video game is away from the center of your thing.
[6750.06 --> 6752.82]  Um, sorry, what?
[6753.02 --> 6753.66]  Center of the game world.
[6754.02 --> 6754.34]  Yeah.
[6754.36 --> 6755.48]  But it stopped having a center.
[6755.72 --> 6756.00]  Yeah.
[6756.26 --> 6756.48]  Yeah.
[6756.60 --> 6760.92]  So like, so theoretically this, this AI model is not constrained by that.
[6761.00 --> 6763.26]  You could just, you could just keep going up.
[6763.38 --> 6765.88]  You could have more than 360 degrees.
[6766.42 --> 6767.22]  Like it's just.
[6767.32 --> 6768.92]  I'm just screwing with a modest panda.
[6769.04 --> 6769.36]  Don't worry about it.
[6769.36 --> 6770.24]  It's like Xbox.
[6772.74 --> 6774.64]  Um, yeah, very cool.
[6775.46 --> 6776.80]  I'm more of a down guy.
[6776.80 --> 6782.16]  I'm a down enjoyer myself.
[6782.16 --> 6784.04]  Like naturally sourced or artificial?
[6784.78 --> 6791.28]  You know what you might enjoy is using a convenient app that is readily available to track world leaders.
[6792.24 --> 6793.66]  Ah, yeah.
[6793.66 --> 6811.76]  According to journalists at French newspaper Le Monde, it is apparently possible to track the location of President Emmanuel Macron by identifying his bodyguards, many of whom have public accounts under their legal names, on Strava, a fitness app with social networking elements.
[6811.76 --> 6817.72]  This means that they have been publicly posting their running routes, including geo data.
[6819.48 --> 6821.98]  Which means, where are they?
[6822.48 --> 6823.56]  Where is the president?
[6823.94 --> 6824.88]  Yes, problem.
[6825.26 --> 6834.54]  It is also apparently possible to do the same with other world leaders, including the US president and both presidential candidates.
[6834.54 --> 6837.84]  This is not a new problem.
[6838.22 --> 6842.66]  In 2023, a Russian submarine commander was killed while jogging.
[6842.86 --> 6849.54]  The commander had a Strava account under his own name, which his assailant may have used to track his regular routes.
[6850.18 --> 6851.64]  Yeah, so this one wasn't bodyguards.
[6851.72 --> 6852.88]  It was the actual guy.
[6853.54 --> 6854.10]  Um.
[6854.76 --> 6859.44]  Andre B says, wasn't there something about soldiers identifying secret bases the same way?
[6859.44 --> 6864.48]  Yes, I believe that did happen with a, um, with a secret US military installation of some kind.
[6864.74 --> 6866.16]  There's a lot of these types of problems.
[6866.28 --> 6871.06]  There's even more subtle ones that I don't think people really properly consider.
[6871.46 --> 6881.44]  Um, because like when this, when the, when the 2023 thing happened with the Russian submarine commander, um, I think that brought to light to a bunch of people like, oh, maybe I should consider this.
[6881.44 --> 6897.40]  One that I point out fairly often, um, when I meet parents of kids and those, uh, the, the kid likes playing Pokemon Go and the parent is just like, you know, being supportive, but doesn't really understand what's going on.
[6897.40 --> 6914.82]  Is I like to point out that when you give gifts in the game, the gifts come with a postcard of where the gift came from and you get gifts in the game by spinning stops, but you are most likely to spin the stop that is closest to your house most often.
[6915.78 --> 6920.64]  So people can figure out where you live based on being friends with you on Pokemon Go.
[6921.38 --> 6921.86]  Um.
[6923.60 --> 6924.82]  Uh, I don't know.
[6924.82 --> 6934.78]  CH 5609 says this is like people figuring out that deep shit was going down because of a higher number of pizza orders to the pizza hut slash dominoes near the Pentagon.
[6935.12 --> 6936.06]  That's a longterm thing.
[6936.16 --> 6939.36]  They, they, there are actually like trackers for that and stuff.
[6939.48 --> 6944.38]  Cause it's like a reliable metric that doesn't seem to be becoming less reliable.
[6945.18 --> 6945.74]  Yeah.
[6946.36 --> 6946.88]  Nice.
[6947.38 --> 6948.40]  Washington pizza index.
[6948.48 --> 6949.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[6949.34 --> 6950.50]  The pizza index.
[6950.70 --> 6951.98]  Yeah, this is like totally a thing.
[6951.98 --> 6956.58]  YouTube users have been reporting missing view counts and upload dates.
[6957.06 --> 6959.22]  Uh, there's a Reddit post from four months ago.
[6960.22 --> 6960.78]  Um.
[6962.68 --> 6966.94]  Some users recently though found that there were no longer view counts or upload dates on YouTube's homepage.
[6967.28 --> 6970.48]  This led to reporting that YouTube might be performing another experiment.
[6971.10 --> 6978.28]  YouTube, however, has responded and says this is actually a bug that is typically experienced by users with certain browser extensions enabled.
[6978.28 --> 6984.16]  The company suggests disabling these extensions and making a report if the issue continues.
[6984.32 --> 6987.86]  So our discussion question here, this just came up cause someone flagged it for me recently.
[6988.26 --> 6991.58]  Uh, do you think this is a YouTube experiment or another attack on ad block?
[6992.24 --> 6999.92]  Would you find that it would degrade the experience of YouTube for you if you didn't know the upload date and how many views a video had?
[6999.92 --> 7000.52]  Yes.
[7003.52 --> 7005.42]  I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[7005.50 --> 7009.68]  Although I understand why you wouldn't want that because it could potentially really help small creators.
[7010.58 --> 7012.60]  I'm gonna, why I wouldn't want what?
[7013.98 --> 7017.16]  Uh, why you wouldn't want it to show view counts.
[7017.88 --> 7019.18]  Why I wouldn't want it to?
[7019.30 --> 7026.26]  Yeah, because if you're a, if you're a really small creator, you don't want people to not click on your video just because it has 200 views.
[7026.26 --> 7026.74]  Yeah.
[7027.12 --> 7031.60]  No, no, that would be, I could see how that level, how that could level the playing field in a big way.
[7031.72 --> 7031.90]  Yeah.
[7032.02 --> 7032.14]  Yeah.
[7032.34 --> 7032.88]  Upload date.
[7032.88 --> 7033.64]  Sorry, what would I want?
[7033.86 --> 7034.86]  What would I not want though?
[7036.14 --> 7036.50]  Huh?
[7037.10 --> 7039.06]  Oh, I thought you said, you said I wouldn't want it.
[7039.20 --> 7040.18]  What would I not want?
[7040.26 --> 7041.52]  I was just trying to figure that out.
[7041.60 --> 7043.24]  I don't remember the exact reference.
[7043.42 --> 7043.66]  Oh.
[7043.92 --> 7045.66]  Of the moment of when I said that.
[7045.72 --> 7046.14]  Oh, okay.
[7046.26 --> 7048.14]  I object to this mostly as a user.
[7048.26 --> 7050.02]  I'm not really thinking about it as a creator.
[7050.22 --> 7053.30]  However, I'm going to play devil's advocate against my own argument.
[7053.30 --> 7061.08]  And I'm going to kind of share an observation that has materialized for me over a while.
[7061.22 --> 7068.54]  It's bothered me a lot for years that Netflix doesn't show the popularity of things.
[7068.88 --> 7071.30]  Like not in a, not in a, in a universal way.
[7071.36 --> 7074.52]  They'll have like popular for people like you, you know, they'll have stuff like that.
[7074.52 --> 7081.32]  They don't show things like a critical acclaim or like a rotten tomatoes rating or anything like that.
[7081.40 --> 7094.06]  Basically, they just merchandise the movie or TV show or whatever it is with photos and descriptions and kind of present it to you and algorithmically track what kind of what works for you and what you like and what you don't.
[7094.06 --> 7097.00]  And, and, and they kind of, they, they make that whole thing work.
[7097.00 --> 7097.26]  Right.
[7097.72 --> 7112.42]  And one of the things that I've observed is that my family watches almost nothing on Plex and gravitates towards Netflix far more than Plex, even though the library on Plex is actually much larger.
[7112.42 --> 7118.92]  And I realized for myself that when I go to try to find something to watch on Plex, it's really hard.
[7119.40 --> 7123.90]  And one of the reasons that it kind of, I had kind of a light bulb moment.
[7124.14 --> 7126.82]  One of the reasons is the data.
[7127.76 --> 7135.08]  Having the data of how good something is makes it so much harder to find something that, you know what?
[7135.32 --> 7140.58]  I might actually end up enjoying, even if it's not good.
[7140.58 --> 7148.82]  I will almost universally enjoy something that has super high critical acclaim and also audiences love it.
[7148.88 --> 7150.32]  Like the wild robot is outstanding.
[7150.42 --> 7151.18]  Just go watch it.
[7151.30 --> 7151.96]  Don't question it.
[7152.00 --> 7152.72]  Just go watch it.
[7153.12 --> 7156.22]  Um, it was just a great film.
[7156.70 --> 7163.62]  Um, but there are times when I will enjoy something that is not critically acclaimed.
[7163.62 --> 7173.86]  For example, Major Pain got a 29% rating on the Tomatometer from critics.
[7174.50 --> 7183.38]  And even 68%, like if you know the film, you'll know that 68% for a film of this genre is actually pretty good.
[7183.72 --> 7185.72]  It's a pretty polarizing film.
[7185.72 --> 7200.38]  Um, and I was thinking about how if I saw something that was rated 29% by critics and 68% by audiences in my Plex, I probably wouldn't bother watching it.
[7200.60 --> 7207.98]  And so I guess where I'm coming back to in all of this is maybe the metadata that they give us.
[7208.36 --> 7210.18]  Coming back even to like-dislike ratio.
[7210.54 --> 7214.24]  Crazy that some things have a relationship when it comes to audience score.
[7214.24 --> 7218.76]  Yeah, I mean, I think the critics are probably right on that one.
[7218.94 --> 7221.68]  And maybe part of it is that you watched Hackers when you were young.
[7222.04 --> 7222.26]  Yeah.
[7222.60 --> 7223.90]  And I watched it as an adult.
[7224.22 --> 7225.84]  And I watched Major Pain when I was young.
[7225.88 --> 7228.94]  I also think I'm more into the subject matter.
[7229.80 --> 7230.78]  Have you seen Major Pain?
[7231.06 --> 7231.34]  Yes.
[7231.62 --> 7232.04]  Oh, okay.
[7232.46 --> 7234.54]  And you thought it was like dumb or bad?
[7234.56 --> 7235.56]  No, I thought it was funny.
[7235.76 --> 7236.14]  Oh, okay.
[7236.14 --> 7244.22]  Um, so, so the problem with like-dislike when YouTube removed that was that,
[7244.24 --> 7248.68]  there's a lot of content where it's really important to be able to see that kind of rating.
[7248.68 --> 7250.16]  Because they don't have a community note system.
[7250.24 --> 7251.26]  They don't have anything equivalent.
[7251.68 --> 7255.32]  If a guide for how to repair your dishwasher is like not very good.
[7255.74 --> 7263.36]  Or if, you know, a moon landing conspiracy video is a conspiracy video and is like something irrelevant that we shouldn't be watching.
[7264.10 --> 7265.96]  They don't really have an equivalent for that.
[7266.18 --> 7272.00]  And so the like-dislike ratio was at least a useful barometer of potential usefulness or quality.
[7272.92 --> 7275.58]  But view counts, upload dates.
[7275.86 --> 7276.90]  Upload date might be.
[7277.10 --> 7279.00]  Upload date, depending on what you're looking for.
[7279.22 --> 7284.68]  If what YouTube seeks to be is just an entertainment platform where people watch as much as possible,
[7284.68 --> 7287.20]  could they?
[7287.20 --> 7291.08]  Why do they seem to be killing evergreen content if they're going to get rid of upload dates though?
[7291.26 --> 7293.32]  I don't know that they're killing evergreen content.
[7293.34 --> 7294.32]  It doesn't seem to be doing as well.
[7294.38 --> 7297.24]  We could probably have a much longer conversation about that.
[7297.32 --> 7299.84]  I think some of our evergreen content is struggling a little bit.
[7299.90 --> 7300.76]  We upload a lot.
[7301.56 --> 7304.68]  We are tech-centric, which can make even our-
[7304.68 --> 7305.44]  So something becomes less relevant?
[7305.44 --> 7308.80]  Yeah, even our evergreen content I think is less evergreen than say-
[7308.80 --> 7310.72]  Well, I was going to say comedy, but comedy can-
[7310.72 --> 7312.94]  Sometimes it ages like fine milk.
[7313.16 --> 7316.28]  But depending on the content, some things are more evergreen than others.
[7316.56 --> 7320.30]  The guide for how to repair this dishwasher model is evergreen.
[7320.42 --> 7322.98]  Because that dishwasher model will always be that dishwasher model.
[7323.16 --> 7324.68]  Well, less people have it.
[7324.94 --> 7325.68]  This is true.
[7326.14 --> 7326.62]  This is true.
[7326.76 --> 7329.28]  Unless it's a really important one.
[7330.24 --> 7331.72]  And people would restore them.
[7331.76 --> 7334.24]  Maybe it's the firehouse one.
[7334.76 --> 7335.06]  Sure.
[7335.44 --> 7335.72]  Sure.
[7335.88 --> 7337.02]  And people always need to fix it.
[7337.22 --> 7337.46]  Anyway.
[7337.98 --> 7343.32]  The point is that maybe they could expand people's horizons, which could be a benefit,
[7343.44 --> 7344.76]  even if it comes with some trade-offs.
[7344.98 --> 7349.26]  And they could improve their own internal metrics, which are increasing watch time,
[7349.26 --> 7360.30]  by actually giving us far less measurable, like empirical data about a piece of content.
[7362.24 --> 7362.72]  Thoughts?
[7362.72 --> 7366.54]  I might enjoy my Plex library more.
[7366.54 --> 7372.66]  What I'm trying to say is I might enjoy my Plex library more if I didn't know how good something was.
[7372.66 --> 7378.48]  I think there's too many things that I watch on YouTube.
[7378.48 --> 7380.48]  I think there's too many things that I watch on YouTube.
[7380.48 --> 7399.42]  I think there's too many things that are useful for the history of tech and that are not on topic.
[7399.42 --> 7400.10]  Yeah.
[7400.10 --> 7401.36]  History of tech, though.
[7401.60 --> 7401.94]  Sure.
[7401.94 --> 7407.96]  So what if we have a WAN show and the title is like, Google killed a company again?
[7409.52 --> 7412.16]  And then you're like, oh, what did they kill this time?
[7412.26 --> 7416.30]  And then you're like, wait, how long does it take you to figure out that this happened years ago?
[7416.30 --> 7420.12]  And they're not talking about the 87 things that they've killed in between then and now.
[7421.08 --> 7422.06]  I guess I don't know.
[7422.06 --> 7422.54]  Yeah.
[7422.54 --> 7427.54]  It leaves you to like, you have to sit there and watch the video to figure out if this is actually a video that you want to watch or not.
[7427.72 --> 7430.46]  Instead of being able to just look at the date and be like, okay, got it.
[7430.50 --> 7431.58]  Which is good for the platform.
[7431.82 --> 7435.06]  Or it gets people to just leave the platform entirely because it's annoying.
[7435.06 --> 7440.12]  I came across this video in my shorts feed.
[7440.22 --> 7441.96]  Actually, speaking of this.
[7443.14 --> 7443.52]  Kyle!
[7443.72 --> 7445.16]  It was Kyle from Bitwit.
[7445.16 --> 7455.82]  And the reason I noticed it in my shorts feed was because the thumbnail had this frame of me in it.
[7456.56 --> 7461.60]  And I was like, sorry, when was Kyle from Bitwit talking about me?
[7461.60 --> 7468.50]  And I clicked on it and I realized like how obfuscated things are now.
[7468.88 --> 7470.76]  So, okay, we've got likes.
[7470.96 --> 7471.82]  There's no view count.
[7472.42 --> 7474.44]  So, this is already like happening.
[7474.88 --> 7477.76]  This is already the direction the interface is going.
[7478.08 --> 7480.20]  I can't see how many subscribers Kyle has.
[7480.58 --> 7482.38]  In fact, what drove me...
[7482.38 --> 7483.46]  Oh, this is interesting.
[7484.04 --> 7484.70]  Oh, weird.
[7485.70 --> 7486.26]  The...
[7486.26 --> 7491.26]  This has the channel name, but the...
[7491.26 --> 7492.64]  Oh, my gosh.
[7492.70 --> 7493.54]  I swear.
[7493.94 --> 7499.26]  I swear the screenshot that I sent to our rep earlier today did not...
[7501.26 --> 7503.26]  Oh, so trippy.
[7503.90 --> 7504.20]  Okay.
[7504.26 --> 7507.30]  So, when I navigated to this not from his channel, Kyle...
[7507.30 --> 7509.36]  Luke can confirm.
[7509.54 --> 7510.08]  Yeah, confirmed.
[7510.70 --> 7511.44]  I know what you're talking about.
[7511.44 --> 7512.38]  There's no channel name.
[7512.54 --> 7512.66]  Yeah.
[7512.66 --> 7513.68]  No subscribe button.
[7513.68 --> 7517.58]  There's no way for me to get information about who he even is.
[7517.70 --> 7523.68]  Which sort of flies in the face of YouTube's claims that the shorts feed can be like a funnel for your...
[7523.68 --> 7525.18]  That's the opposite of that.
[7525.54 --> 7525.74]  Yeah.
[7525.82 --> 7526.32]  I was like...
[7526.32 --> 7527.70]  I was like, what the heck is this?
[7527.74 --> 7528.40]  I have no way of...
[7528.40 --> 7529.34]  I have no way of finding this.
[7529.72 --> 7531.68]  Anyway, my point is...
[7531.68 --> 7539.54]  I think it would be a terrible thing for YouTube because of the vastly different way that people use YouTube compared to a movie library.
[7539.78 --> 7542.92]  But in general, maybe less data could be a good thing.
[7543.18 --> 7544.16]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[7544.40 --> 7554.92]  And I guess my question was, would degrading the experience in this way make you less likely to use an ad blocker if this was one of the levers that they decided to pull?
[7554.92 --> 7560.00]  If you're an ad blocker, they just like remove other elements of the page.
[7562.72 --> 7563.12]  Yeah.
[7563.42 --> 7563.66]  Probably.
[7563.84 --> 7566.88]  Would that harm your use of the platform?
[7567.02 --> 7571.34]  I think for a pretty considerable amount of YouTube viewing that I do, it would do that.
[7571.56 --> 7571.68]  Yeah.
[7573.72 --> 7573.94]  Yeah.
[7575.84 --> 7581.54]  Corey is the name says, I find myself judging fictional books intensely if I see their rating prior to reading.
[7581.54 --> 7586.90]  I think about that rating throughout the process of reading the book and I end up losing some of my focus on the content itself.
[7587.84 --> 7588.24]  Yeah.
[7588.44 --> 7589.86]  A date isn't a rating though.
[7590.06 --> 7594.60]  Like I understand what you're saying with the like to dislike side of things, but a date is not a rating.
[7594.72 --> 7595.54]  A date is a...
[7596.34 --> 7597.52]  I don't know.
[7597.60 --> 7605.14]  Sometimes a very old video can communicate that it could be a very quality thing.
[7605.50 --> 7608.88]  And sometimes a very new video is kind of a requirement.
[7608.88 --> 7621.34]  If you're trying to keep up to date on what's happening in US politics and you look up something to do with Trump, for example, and running for election.
[7622.08 --> 7622.56]  Yeah.
[7622.60 --> 7625.46]  It could easily be the 2016 or the 2020 election.
[7625.76 --> 7625.90]  Yeah.
[7625.92 --> 7628.60]  Like it sounds super annoying to be completely honest.
[7628.60 --> 7631.10]  Like there's, there's certain things that are just timely.
[7631.10 --> 7635.18]  Um, what if you wanted to find something from the 2016 election?
[7635.18 --> 7638.64]  What if they used AI to determine whether a video really needs a date on it or not?
[7638.74 --> 7639.10]  Bleh!
[7640.96 --> 7643.70]  Uh, Naz Freak says YouTube has confirmed it's not testing removing it.
[7643.72 --> 7644.34]  It was a side effect.
[7644.40 --> 7644.64]  I know.
[7644.74 --> 7646.00]  It just prompted a conversation.
[7646.12 --> 7646.44]  That's all.
[7647.04 --> 7648.34]  I just wanted to talk about it a little bit.
[7648.34 --> 7650.54]  It's a side effect of certain add-ons or something?
[7650.62 --> 7651.48]  Side effect of your face.
[7651.74 --> 7651.90]  Oh!
[7652.06 --> 7652.70]  Uh, yeah, extensions.
[7652.82 --> 7654.96]  We, we, we said that earlier, but they might be tuning in a little later.
[7654.96 --> 7656.26]  Did they say what kind of extensions?
[7656.54 --> 7656.80]  Nope.
[7657.06 --> 7657.36]  Okay.
[7657.36 --> 7659.68]  Who knows what kind?
[7660.04 --> 7664.20]  Uh, Dan, I think that's it for the topics on the WAN show this week.
[7664.26 --> 7666.10]  Do you want to switch us over to After Dark?
[7666.16 --> 7666.46]  Okay.
[7666.56 --> 7667.20]  I can do that.
[7667.24 --> 7667.60]  Absolutely.
[7667.80 --> 7668.52]  Let's do it.
[7668.92 --> 7669.08]  Wow.
[7669.10 --> 7670.34]  There's so many of you watching today.
[7671.32 --> 7672.32]  A date is context.
[7672.44 --> 7672.64]  Yeah.
[7672.72 --> 7673.84]  Like, I don't know.
[7674.04 --> 7675.14]  I think the date matters.
[7675.50 --> 7676.08]  I get it.
[7676.10 --> 7677.72]  No, to be clear, I want the date.
[7677.84 --> 7678.08]  Yeah.
[7678.16 --> 7682.34]  But like, would I be more likely to watch It's a Wonderful World if I didn't know that
[7682.34 --> 7683.18]  it was like old?
[7684.24 --> 7684.60]  Maybe.
[7685.10 --> 7686.88]  See, I think it could add value though.
[7686.88 --> 7688.04]  Or like Tootsie, you know?
[7688.14 --> 7689.02]  Cause like the fact that.
[7689.02 --> 7689.26]  Whatever.
[7689.38 --> 7690.58]  Just like some old movie.
[7690.74 --> 7695.00]  The fact that we both know the name It's a Wonderful World means.
[7695.20 --> 7695.74]  Or It's a Wonderful Life.
[7695.88 --> 7696.66]  Sorry, It's a Wonderful Life.
[7696.98 --> 7697.86]  I think, isn't that.
[7697.88 --> 7698.16]  My dad.
[7698.26 --> 7699.04]  Oh, it's just a turn of phrase.
[7699.12 --> 7699.40]  No, no.
[7699.44 --> 7701.62]  That's the, uh, What a Wonderful World.
[7701.66 --> 7702.38]  That's the song.
[7702.62 --> 7702.84]  Okay.
[7702.90 --> 7703.10]  Sure.
[7703.54 --> 7708.24]  Basically, I don't know either of them is what we're coming to on conclusion, but I know
[7708.24 --> 7709.18]  the, the phrase.
[7709.30 --> 7713.28]  So if I saw that and I saw the date, I'm like, oh, I know this name.
[7713.92 --> 7714.88]  It's super old.
[7714.88 --> 7716.72]  That probably means it was amazing.
[7717.68 --> 7718.90]  So I'm going to check this out.
[7720.40 --> 7721.58]  But it could go either way.
[7722.14 --> 7728.48]  Like if you hear someone in modern times say, hey, Schindler's List is like an amazing movie.
[7729.14 --> 7729.54]  Yeah.
[7729.54 --> 7730.22]  Like, okay.
[7730.94 --> 7732.80]  And then you see that it's old.
[7733.42 --> 7738.68]  It might go like, oh, it was amazing enough for them to still care about it despite it
[7738.68 --> 7739.78]  not being a new release.
[7739.86 --> 7740.52]  Maybe I'll watch that.
[7740.60 --> 7740.92]  I don't know.
[7741.16 --> 7741.84]  Different people.
[7741.96 --> 7743.26]  It could communicate value.
[7743.46 --> 7744.76]  Different people have different perspectives.
[7745.18 --> 7748.56]  Like, uh, Yvonne, for example, doesn't like watching old media.
[7748.72 --> 7752.58]  She just finds, especially the audio quality when you go back a certain amount is like
[7752.58 --> 7753.78]  not good enough for her to enjoy.
[7754.74 --> 7758.64]  Um, like they're, they're, they're sound recording techniques.
[7758.64 --> 7764.16]  If you go back to like the seventies, early eighties, we're not as good and it's not as
[7764.16 --> 7765.22]  clean as it is now.
[7765.42 --> 7766.16]  It doesn't bother me.
[7766.22 --> 7769.90]  I think it adds some charm, but I can understand having a different perspective on that.
[7769.90 --> 7772.14]  Uh, Dan, do you want to hit us with some rich messages?
[7772.56 --> 7772.98]  Yeah, sure.
[7773.80 --> 7774.66]  Hi LDL.
[7774.76 --> 7779.00]  Recently, my desktop YouTube page has reduced the amount of thumbnails to three per row,
[7779.34 --> 7783.28]  leaving me with six videos on full screen, forcing me to scroll more.
[7783.54 --> 7785.62]  Do you have any thoughts on this trend?
[7785.70 --> 7787.48]  I've seen some people complaining about this.
[7787.58 --> 7792.38]  Um, I personally am a huge proponent of higher density.
[7792.38 --> 7795.50]  I mean, but maybe part of that is a generational gap thing.
[7795.50 --> 7803.40]  Like when I was a kid, screens were small and resolution was low and every upgrade was so
[7803.40 --> 7805.08]  that you could fit more stuff on the screen.
[7805.16 --> 7806.20]  And so the screen would be bigger.
[7806.20 --> 7807.88]  So you could see more at a time.
[7808.44 --> 7815.64]  A very interesting rabbit hole to go down is North American versus Japanese web design.
[7815.72 --> 7819.02]  Oh man, they're like violently opposite.
[7819.26 --> 7822.36]  It's crazy, but they are successful in their areas.
[7822.36 --> 7827.20]  It's not just that like, you know, Japanese web designers just feel like doing it some
[7827.20 --> 7827.52]  other way.
[7827.74 --> 7829.36]  No, they just don't give a shit.
[7829.46 --> 7831.24]  No, it works better with Japanese audiences.
[7831.44 --> 7836.52]  And then when you, when you try to put American web design in front of Japanese audiences, they
[7836.52 --> 7837.44]  don't, they don't like it as much.
[7837.48 --> 7838.48]  They don't engage with it as much.
[7838.52 --> 7839.74]  I don't remember all the details.
[7839.84 --> 7844.98]  Then when you put Japanese web design styles in front of American audiences, they're like,
[7844.98 --> 7846.26]  You get a reaction like this.
[7846.64 --> 7850.80]  Delmaine in float plane chat says, I legitimately cannot stand Japanese web design.
[7850.94 --> 7852.20]  It's insane to me.
[7852.36 --> 7852.64]  Yeah.
[7853.42 --> 7853.66]  Yeah.
[7853.86 --> 7856.10]  But they work really well within their cultures.
[7856.22 --> 7857.00]  It's very interesting.
[7857.10 --> 7859.54]  It's actually a genuinely very interesting rabbit hole.
[7859.56 --> 7862.34]  Part of my feelings about it could also be a generational gap.
[7862.58 --> 7863.64]  Oh, wait, did I already say that part?
[7863.72 --> 7864.06]  Well, okay.
[7864.08 --> 7866.00]  I have another supporting piece of this.
[7866.36 --> 7870.14]  Because Yvonne was talking to some other people internally here, like younger people,
[7870.28 --> 7870.96]  Gen Z people.
[7871.64 --> 7873.48]  And she was talking about booking a trip.
[7874.18 --> 7876.58]  And they were like, Oh, well, you know, whatever.
[7876.70 --> 7878.84]  And Yvonne's like, Oh, well, yeah, I can't look at that right now.
[7878.86 --> 7879.58]  I'm not at my computer.
[7879.58 --> 7882.00]  And they go, well, what, you don't just book flights on your phone?
[7882.10 --> 7883.72]  She's like, no, who would do that?
[7883.92 --> 7886.70]  And they're like, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[7886.80 --> 7887.54]  It is inferior.
[7887.76 --> 7888.36]  Yvonne is correct.
[7888.86 --> 7890.64]  It is vastly inferior.
[7890.84 --> 7892.44]  Yvonne is 100% correct.
[7892.54 --> 7892.66]  Yep.
[7892.66 --> 7900.64]  But apparently that's a big generational gap thing is that millennials will go to the computer
[7900.64 --> 7902.30]  to do certain things.
[7902.44 --> 7903.88]  And booking travel is one of them.
[7904.10 --> 7911.18]  Whereas Gen Zs will absolutely just use their phone to do stuff like that, even though they
[7911.18 --> 7914.96]  obviously cannot do a good enough job of it.
[7914.96 --> 7917.96]  And comparison shopping and without using spreadsheets.
[7917.96 --> 7921.96]  But that is very much an R generation thing.
[7922.84 --> 7923.96]  To even think of like...
[7923.96 --> 7924.30]  R generation is correct about this.
[7924.50 --> 7925.44]  We're wrong about a lot of things.
[7925.54 --> 7926.58]  We're correct about that.
[7926.80 --> 7927.38]  It's a screen.
[7927.52 --> 7928.18]  Big purchase.
[7928.38 --> 7931.96]  To even think about using the desktop.
[7932.08 --> 7933.24]  Going to use the computer.
[7933.82 --> 7933.98]  You know?
[7934.16 --> 7934.32]  Yeah.
[7934.40 --> 7935.70]  But yeah, 100%.
[7935.70 --> 7940.12]  The bigger the purchase, the better the chance that I want to use a big screen to do it.
[7940.14 --> 7940.40]  Yeah, for sure.
[7941.04 --> 7944.24]  It's the same accounts, but it feels weird having money go through my phone.
[7944.68 --> 7945.28]  Do you know what I mean?
[7945.76 --> 7949.34]  Like I'm on the Amazon app on my phone, but money has to go through it.
[7949.58 --> 7951.00]  No, even just like buying a little thing.
[7951.26 --> 7952.32]  No, I don't mind that.
[7953.18 --> 7955.74]  If I just like need something right now...
[7955.74 --> 7956.40]  Artie's based.
[7956.84 --> 7957.96]  What did Artie say?
[7957.96 --> 7960.88]  As a Zoomer, I agree with PC being superior for big purchases.
[7961.24 --> 7965.54]  And like there's certain things where I'll use both depending on the context.
[7965.54 --> 7971.42]  So if I'm just like browsing houses for the lulls, like I'm looking at the most expensive
[7971.42 --> 7973.12]  houses for sale in Vancouver right now.
[7973.18 --> 7973.88]  I'll do that on my phone.
[7973.98 --> 7974.26]  I don't care.
[7974.34 --> 7975.96]  I'm just like doom scrolling like nonsense.
[7976.18 --> 7977.74]  I'm looking at people's fancy houses.
[7977.98 --> 7979.54]  If I am shopping...
[7980.42 --> 7980.56]  Dude.
[7981.34 --> 7982.22]  Research phone.
[7982.46 --> 7983.30]  Are you kidding me?
[7983.30 --> 7983.38]  Purchase PC.
[7983.38 --> 7990.02]  Sometimes I'll go look over at North Van and just slide that willing to pay scale up.
[7990.10 --> 7990.54]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7990.54 --> 7993.40]  Just be like, you know, if I just had a helicopter, I could just fly into work.
[7993.48 --> 7994.80]  That I don't mind doing on my phone.
[7994.80 --> 7995.12]  Sick.
[7995.24 --> 7995.72]  Yeah, exactly.
[7995.84 --> 7999.02]  But like if I'm actually shopping, no, I gotta be on my computer, man.
[7999.34 --> 8000.40]  I gotta be on my computer.
[8002.66 --> 8010.90]  I'm a gamer slash gardener and just got an OLED TV, LG C3, and want to get an QD OLED monitor.
[8011.12 --> 8012.80]  But I'm worried about the purple hue.
[8013.00 --> 8016.98]  I have grow lights on 16 hours a day and never use my computer in the dark.
[8017.08 --> 8018.38]  It's very unlikely to bother you.
[8018.38 --> 8023.52]  I mean, the first example I have of this is my old Aperture Grill CRT.
[8023.52 --> 8029.44]  It had these two little lines across the screen for the alignment wires.
[8029.44 --> 8034.78]  And I read reviews and people were like, oh yeah, it's like, it's annoying.
[8035.08 --> 8035.60]  It's this.
[8035.72 --> 8038.74]  And then other people were like, oh no, yeah, you forget about it.
[8038.78 --> 8039.36]  And I got it.
[8039.38 --> 8039.94]  I brought it home.
[8040.02 --> 8040.58]  I unpacked it.
[8040.60 --> 8042.60]  And I was like, oh, they're really annoying.
[8042.70 --> 8044.26]  They bother me so much.
[8044.70 --> 8049.48]  They're visible, especially on white backgrounds, which, you know, going back to the early 2000s,
[8049.52 --> 8052.20]  mid 2000s, it was basically every webpage, right?
[8052.20 --> 8054.02]  Like everything was, there was no dark mode.
[8054.86 --> 8060.10]  And I was on the brink of returning it and paying it like a 15% restocking fee at NCIX
[8060.10 --> 8060.76]  or whatever it was.
[8060.80 --> 8062.02]  I think it was 15%, right?
[8062.84 --> 8063.50]  Something like that.
[8063.58 --> 8064.24]  That sounds correct.
[8064.48 --> 8067.52]  And then I gave it a little bit longer and then I forgot they were there.
[8068.62 --> 8070.22]  And the purple hue is kind of like that.
[8070.30 --> 8071.04]  Yeah, you'll notice it.
[8071.08 --> 8073.94]  It'll be super noticeable when you know about it.
[8073.94 --> 8078.34]  And then you'll be playing a game and it'll be like half an hour later and you'll be like,
[8078.40 --> 8079.78]  oh, I haven't thought about the purple hue in a while.
[8080.80 --> 8082.40]  I wouldn't stress about it too much.
[8082.52 --> 8086.38]  I remembered something about the Japanese versus American website design thing.
[8086.48 --> 8092.94]  It had something to do with like obfuscation of information and desire for comfort versus
[8092.94 --> 8093.46]  knowledge.
[8094.18 --> 8098.22]  And the Japanese web design leans more towards information overload.
[8098.22 --> 8106.34]  And the American web design leans more towards comfort and, you know, you're just going
[8106.34 --> 8108.58]  to trust that this is going to be legit, whatever.
[8109.92 --> 8110.36]  Interesting.
[8110.82 --> 8112.20]  I don't remember all the details.
[8112.34 --> 8114.56]  It's actually like a fairly deep topic if you guys are interested.
[8114.70 --> 8117.72]  But that was, I remember that being sort of one of the, one of the concepts.
[8118.20 --> 8123.54]  By the way, enjoy your grow lights and maybe try that weird AI Minecraft thing.
[8125.20 --> 8126.30]  That dude, phew.
[8126.30 --> 8128.28]  Can't even imagine.
[8128.46 --> 8128.76]  Yeah.
[8131.02 --> 8132.84]  G'day boys from Down Under.
[8133.04 --> 8137.56]  I'm planning to build a new PC and pretty sold on the 9000X3D series.
[8137.82 --> 8140.96]  Do you think the 9800X3D is going to be the best bet?
[8141.22 --> 8142.70]  Should I hold out for something better?
[8142.98 --> 8144.36]  How are you pretty sold on that already?
[8145.54 --> 8146.36]  No comment.
[8148.26 --> 8149.04]  What's going on?
[8149.34 --> 8150.52]  We know too much.
[8150.96 --> 8151.20]  Yeah.
[8151.20 --> 8152.48]  To answer this question.
[8152.68 --> 8155.92]  You shouldn't be sold on something before independent reviews are out.
[8157.30 --> 8159.14]  I would encourage you to watch ours.
[8159.28 --> 8162.72]  I would also encourage you to watch others or read others.
[8162.92 --> 8163.08]  Neat.
[8163.58 --> 8163.90]  Yeah.
[8167.02 --> 8170.72]  Linus, when you were on the yard, how close were you to walking out when they did their
[8170.72 --> 8171.62]  DJ intro?
[8171.62 --> 8175.70]  I mean, I was warned by Luke what those guys were like.
[8175.76 --> 8176.80]  It wasn't my first time.
[8178.48 --> 8179.70]  We were there.
[8179.84 --> 8182.38]  We did the bro versus bro first.
[8182.60 --> 8186.04]  So I encountered Ludwig by that point.
[8186.10 --> 8187.64]  Wait, did we do the bro versus bro first?
[8187.80 --> 8188.30]  Yeah, I think so.
[8188.32 --> 8188.92]  Now I don't remember.
[8189.10 --> 8189.28]  No.
[8189.40 --> 8189.58]  I think so.
[8189.88 --> 8191.12]  No, we did bro versus bro after.
[8191.30 --> 8191.52]  Really?
[8192.02 --> 8192.22]  Yeah.
[8192.26 --> 8192.40]  No.
[8192.46 --> 8192.64]  Okay.
[8192.70 --> 8193.16]  Well, nevermind.
[8193.16 --> 8194.76]  Anyway, I knew who Ludwig was.
[8195.90 --> 8202.64]  And so I was surprised, but not shocked.
[8202.98 --> 8207.34]  I was, I was, it was unexpected, but not surprising.
[8208.14 --> 8209.12]  I don't know.
[8209.12 --> 8212.32]  I don't know how to phrase it, but yeah, no, they, they did their, their intro.
[8212.56 --> 8217.82]  I think to go back and do the yard again, I would probably lean more into their bullshit
[8217.82 --> 8222.16]  rather than like kind of be the skeptical, you know, outsider.
[8222.46 --> 8228.18]  But maybe that's sort of part of the, the deal of, you know, having a guest on a show like
[8228.18 --> 8228.54]  that.
[8229.10 --> 8231.04]  Maybe everyone kind of goes through that a little bit.
[8231.06 --> 8231.48]  I wouldn't know.
[8231.54 --> 8232.36]  I don't watch the show.
[8232.36 --> 8236.76]  Um, I had a couple of people that were like very mad about me not knowing who anybody
[8236.76 --> 8240.88]  was and not listening to the podcast or watching the show or whatever else.
[8240.94 --> 8241.80]  Cause I don't know.
[8241.82 --> 8244.02]  It made me seem arrogant or something.
[8244.48 --> 8247.02]  Um, but I was just, I was just trying to be honest.
[8247.02 --> 8248.68]  Like I'm, I'm so sorry.
[8248.78 --> 8253.88]  I actually don't know any of your names because we all introduced ourselves like three minutes
[8253.88 --> 8255.26]  ago before I walked in here.
[8255.26 --> 8261.46]  And then I sat at the top of that slide for all of that time while you guys were DJ racist
[8261.46 --> 8262.02]  or whatever.
[8262.64 --> 8265.62]  And so I just was like, yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[8265.66 --> 8268.32]  The only one of you who I know is, is Ludwig.
[8268.36 --> 8269.66]  And that just kind of is what it is.
[8269.66 --> 8270.26]  And I'm sorry.
[8271.22 --> 8276.48]  Um, but I, some people, you know, took that really negatively, but I mean, you know how things
[8276.48 --> 8276.70]  are.
[8277.58 --> 8284.48]  Um, there's actually one of my, that's, this is one of my favorite sort of yardsticks for,
[8284.48 --> 8293.06]  um, you know, how, how marketable my faces is how content performs when I'm on someone
[8293.06 --> 8294.18]  else's channel.
[8294.18 --> 8299.50]  Uh, because how our videos perform is like, this is your house.
[8299.56 --> 8301.08]  Yeah, this, yeah, exactly.
[8301.48 --> 8302.00]  Exactly.
[8302.00 --> 8308.64]  Like how, how, uh, how, how marketable of a name is, is LTT.
[8308.64 --> 8313.32]  So I, I'm going to do this live, but I'm going to go and have a look at like how you don't
[8313.32 --> 8316.28]  want to look at anything from like a day ago, like a week or two ago.
[8317.10 --> 8318.62]  Um, you know, how'd I do?
[8318.88 --> 8323.84]  So, uh, Geo Rain Bolt, pretty, uh, pretty appealing guest.
[8324.62 --> 8326.14]  So that, that's pretty cool.
[8327.14 --> 8330.08]  Um, let's see who are, who are some other folks?
[8330.18 --> 8333.44]  Hive Mind TV was apparently a pretty good one.
[8333.44 --> 8335.14]  Cause I don't really like, I don't watch YouTube.
[8335.14 --> 8340.06]  So this is one of the ways that I'll, I'll figure out like, okay, who's like a big deal.
[8340.06 --> 8343.92]  Like the Sea Dog VA guy seems to be kind of a big deal.
[8344.10 --> 8345.72]  So that's, that's pretty cool.
[8346.68 --> 8349.08]  Um, Rain Bolt is, is pretty based.
[8349.22 --> 8349.36]  Yeah.
[8349.80 --> 8350.08]  Yeah.
[8350.22 --> 8350.92]  There you go.
[8352.62 --> 8353.94]  Here's one with just the crew.
[8354.04 --> 8354.28]  Okay.
[8354.36 --> 8355.00]  500,000.
[8355.10 --> 8360.18]  So that's kind of the high end of if they don't have a guest on, uh, what else we got?
[8360.38 --> 8361.68]  Do you already know the answer to this?
[8361.68 --> 8362.78]  Oh no, I did pretty good.
[8363.72 --> 8364.12]  Yeah.
[8364.52 --> 8364.92]  800K.
[8364.92 --> 8366.28]  Did you already know the answer to this?
[8366.50 --> 8367.38]  I already know what answer.
[8367.60 --> 8367.98]  To this?
[8368.30 --> 8368.68]  To what?
[8368.78 --> 8369.28]  How well you did.
[8369.44 --> 8370.50]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8370.58 --> 8371.70]  You already knew the answer to this?
[8371.76 --> 8374.58]  I didn't, I haven't looked at it in like, I don't know, two or three months.
[8374.68 --> 8374.90]  Okay.
[8375.02 --> 8377.06]  But I knew that it was like an above average.
[8377.16 --> 8378.80]  I was wondering how performative this was.
[8379.88 --> 8381.38]  No, no, I just haven't looked at it in a while.
[8381.66 --> 8381.98]  Okay.
[8382.16 --> 8382.28]  Okay.
[8382.72 --> 8385.16]  Um, yeah.
[8385.30 --> 8388.60]  So it's, uh, there's a, oh yeah.
[8388.66 --> 8391.24]  Hank Green, Hank Green crushed me, but that makes sense.
[8391.84 --> 8392.22]  Hank Green.
[8392.46 --> 8392.68]  Yep.
[8393.18 --> 8393.42]  Yeah.
[8393.42 --> 8394.40]  They had Hank Green on.
[8394.80 --> 8396.24]  So it's, it's, it's one of those things.
[8396.24 --> 8401.12]  It's like, it helps me kind of figure out, you know, where everyone's stock is at, kind
[8401.12 --> 8406.92]  of at, at whatever time they were, they were on another, like another person's channel and
[8406.92 --> 8409.78]  helps me figure out if like, if like I did okay.
[8409.78 --> 8416.24]  You know, like if anyone, if anyone cares outside of just our like hyper, hyper geek sort of
[8416.24 --> 8417.26]  bubble that we live in.
[8417.48 --> 8417.58]  Yeah.
[8417.58 --> 8424.66]  Um, there were, there were a couple other, uh, cutie Cinderella crushed.
[8425.74 --> 8427.36]  Um, I mean, that makes sense.
[8427.50 --> 8427.82]  Oh yeah.
[8427.98 --> 8429.00]  A hundred percent makes sense.
[8430.28 --> 8430.68]  Some.
[8430.68 --> 8434.94]  Um, she's a great host and she's rather affiliated with that crew.
[8435.06 --> 8435.88]  Rather affiliated.
[8436.34 --> 8436.74]  Amaranth.
[8436.88 --> 8437.38]  It's a way to say.
[8437.38 --> 8438.18]  Amaranth crushed.
[8438.50 --> 8439.28]  That makes sense.
[8439.90 --> 8445.04]  But yeah, I was, I was actually a little surprised to see how much overlap there was.
[8445.14 --> 8450.88]  Like I wasn't expecting their audience and our audience to have a lot of overlap.
[8450.96 --> 8452.22]  That's another thing that it gauges.
[8452.22 --> 8456.04]  So it's not just like, Oh, higher number on someone else's channel automatically.
[8456.04 --> 8457.84]  You're like a big deal in mainstream or whatever.
[8458.04 --> 8458.80]  Like no.
[8459.34 --> 8463.62]  Um, but it can tell you how much overlap there is between people who watch that and people
[8463.62 --> 8466.94]  who watch, and there's too many variables to draw any concrete conclusions, but it's
[8466.94 --> 8467.76]  an indicator.
[8468.00 --> 8473.16]  What's an audience that you don't think you would perform well with because of overlap
[8473.16 --> 8473.76]  issues?
[8474.26 --> 8478.52]  Cause I, I feel like, you know, I, I went, I went through a few in my head and one that
[8478.52 --> 8482.08]  I landed on was like makeup, but then no, I feel like if you would want a makeup channel
[8482.08 --> 8482.98]  would probably kill.
[8483.40 --> 8484.12]  I don't think so.
[8484.32 --> 8484.80]  I think so.
[8484.80 --> 8486.60]  Because all the do bros would be like, what?
[8488.06 --> 8489.78]  I actually bet you it would do pretty.
[8489.88 --> 8490.10]  All right.
[8490.22 --> 8491.14]  I don't think so.
[8491.24 --> 8492.10]  I don't think so.
[8492.72 --> 8496.32]  Um, do bad for them because their algorithm is going to be all screwed, but I feel like
[8496.32 --> 8497.32]  the one episode might do it.
[8497.38 --> 8497.62]  I don't know.
[8497.64 --> 8498.14]  This is a tough one.
[8498.16 --> 8501.82]  If you have any kind of public space where it's just like a mixing pot, like that,
[8501.82 --> 8507.14]  the fact that that school had the teacher and two students who knew enough to go find
[8507.14 --> 8509.94]  this on the subreddit and like knew who we were and like all that stuff.
[8509.94 --> 8511.70]  That's like pretty, that's pretty solid.
[8512.08 --> 8515.08]  But that's just mixing pot.
[8515.18 --> 8515.44]  Right.
[8515.94 --> 8520.54]  Whereas like an actual space where people are selectively there because they have an interest.
[8520.62 --> 8526.26]  Like I would think, I would think if you, if there was a ceramics studio that had a channel
[8526.26 --> 8530.56]  like, and I went on there, there'd be like, there'd be nothing.
[8531.08 --> 8531.98]  I think I might do okay.
[8532.08 --> 8532.92]  No one would care.
[8533.14 --> 8534.36]  I don't think the, uh.
[8534.36 --> 8539.06]  I think you do enough weird random off the wall stuff on this channel that something like
[8539.06 --> 8540.12]  ceramics would do fine.
[8541.52 --> 8543.98]  But it's, it's, that audience would.
[8543.98 --> 8545.46]  I think if it was like a math education channel.
[8546.40 --> 8548.38]  Oh no, that would be super high overlap.
[8548.62 --> 8548.98]  You think?
[8549.14 --> 8549.38]  Oh.
[8549.38 --> 8552.98]  People who are into math education and people who are into technology get real.
[8553.24 --> 8553.56]  Yeah.
[8553.64 --> 8553.92]  Fair enough.
[8553.94 --> 8555.22]  They did well on Veritasium.
[8555.46 --> 8557.90]  That's mostly like pretty crazy stuff.
[8560.08 --> 8561.90]  No, I wasn't thinking like that though.
[8562.00 --> 8563.26]  I was thinking like a number file.
[8563.44 --> 8564.48]  Three brown, one blue.
[8564.48 --> 8565.02]  Oh, three brown, one.
[8565.18 --> 8566.18]  Or one, three brown, one blue.
[8566.18 --> 8567.40]  Three brown, one blue.
[8567.54 --> 8568.08]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8568.28 --> 8568.48]  Yeah.
[8568.48 --> 8569.20]  Something like that too.
[8569.48 --> 8570.12]  To be clear.
[8570.14 --> 8570.80]  Three blue, one brown.
[8570.90 --> 8571.12]  I don't know.
[8571.16 --> 8571.32]  Whatever.
[8571.44 --> 8575.66]  To be clear, Veritasium, I, I completely ignored that one though.
[8576.12 --> 8578.36]  And the reason for that, no, I shouldn't say I ignored it.
[8578.36 --> 8581.36]  I watched the video and like Derek and his team did a great job and everything.
[8581.36 --> 8588.96]  But I, I wasn't going to read anything into that one because his video performance is like,
[8589.42 --> 8591.86]  like so spiky.
[8592.02 --> 8592.82]  Um, and.
[8592.82 --> 8598.40]  Which seems weird to me because they all seem quite consistently good.
[8598.52 --> 8599.90]  You never, I mean.
[8600.60 --> 8601.92]  It's so hard sometimes.
[8602.10 --> 8610.50]  Even a master of YouTube packaging and, and, and content creation is not going to knock it
[8610.50 --> 8612.68]  out of the park every single time.
[8613.16 --> 8614.94]  Unless your name is Mark Rober.
[8616.60 --> 8621.64]  Even he, even he doesn't get the same number of views on every single video because not
[8621.64 --> 8623.16]  everything can appeal to absolutely everybody.
[8623.16 --> 8623.90]  And that's the way it is.
[8624.90 --> 8626.24]  We should work on that.
[8627.02 --> 8627.32]  Yeah.
[8627.34 --> 8628.40]  I mean, we're trying, Dan.
[8629.26 --> 8630.56]  Everybody's trying, Dan.
[8630.70 --> 8631.10]  No, no, no.
[8631.18 --> 8632.02]  You want to be more normie?
[8632.20 --> 8632.94]  No, no, no, no.
[8632.94 --> 8637.86]  I mean, uh, you need to find the video that appeals to literally every single person.
[8638.08 --> 8638.18]  Sure.
[8638.40 --> 8638.62]  Oh.
[8638.74 --> 8640.86]  But then, I mean, that's like not possible, is it?
[8641.14 --> 8641.44]  Yeah.
[8641.90 --> 8642.22]  Nope.
[8642.22 --> 8643.22]  Okay.
[8643.22 --> 8644.22]  Okay.
[8644.34 --> 8644.78]  Up next.
[8644.90 --> 8645.44]  Hi, DLL.
[8645.70 --> 8648.50]  I'm in my senior year of engineering undergrad.
[8648.66 --> 8648.98]  Hey, good to see you.
[8648.98 --> 8654.40]  In my opinion, at best, 96 of the 128 credits are relevant to my success.
[8654.74 --> 8657.08]  How would you pitch higher education to your children?
[8657.36 --> 8658.66]  And do you have hot takes?
[8658.66 --> 8664.10]  Part of the original idea of the credit system and getting people to take credits that were
[8664.10 --> 8671.06]  not in their actual direct courses was to prepare people for being an adult and needing
[8671.06 --> 8674.68]  to like communicate with others about things that aren't just their one singular niche.
[8674.80 --> 8675.38]  Be well-rounded.
[8675.38 --> 8676.78]  They're trying to prep you for like the world.
[8677.08 --> 8677.26]  Yeah.
[8677.44 --> 8679.56]  I don't think it's as relevant these days.
[8679.96 --> 8681.58]  The internet and stuff like that.
[8681.68 --> 8684.88]  They forced Yvonne to take one accounting course as part of her pharmacy degree.
[8684.98 --> 8685.66]  Thank goodness.
[8688.06 --> 8688.28]  Woo!
[8688.66 --> 8691.22]  You never know.
[8691.52 --> 8692.56]  I guess is what I would say.
[8692.56 --> 8697.28]  There was classes that annoyed me when I was in school that I have absolutely used.
[8698.18 --> 8704.46]  Like, yeah, there's even classes that I took back in school that I still would have thought
[8704.46 --> 8708.90]  would have been useless two years ago and have since become useful.
[8709.74 --> 8710.52]  Like, I don't know.
[8710.64 --> 8712.78]  Learning stuff is just good and useful.
[8713.26 --> 8716.04]  And part of it is forcing you to learn to learn.
[8716.28 --> 8716.56]  Yeah.
[8716.56 --> 8721.76]  And push yourself to learn something that you're not inherently interested in and that you might
[8721.76 --> 8724.22]  not see the point of because you never know.
[8725.78 --> 8731.26]  Understand other perspectives and to be less generally useless.
[8731.26 --> 8735.68]  If you are more generally competent, you are less generally useless, which is awesome.
[8736.74 --> 8737.88]  That's a really good thing.
[8737.88 --> 8738.12]  That's a really good thing.
[8738.12 --> 8738.58]  Life tips right there.
[8738.78 --> 8739.96]  It's really fantastic.
[8740.16 --> 8740.58]  Man.
[8740.70 --> 8745.72]  Speaking of higher education, I was reading this interesting article about how college
[8745.72 --> 8750.92]  professors are like, we don't really know what to do because they assign reading to new students
[8750.92 --> 8753.02]  and they just like don't read.
[8753.40 --> 8758.22]  Like they literally arrive in college going, yeah, we've been assigned like excerpts to read,
[8758.32 --> 8764.36]  but we've never been assigned just like read this book and come back in a couple days when
[8764.36 --> 8764.74]  you're done.
[8764.74 --> 8767.28]  Students entering Harvard that have never once read a book.
[8767.64 --> 8769.98]  That is flipping wild to me.
[8770.14 --> 8770.40]  Yeah.
[8770.52 --> 8771.82]  I don't know how to deal with that.
[8772.08 --> 8772.38]  Yeah.
[8775.26 --> 8775.70]  Yeah.
[8776.30 --> 8779.58]  Y'all gotta like read like a bit and stuff.
[8779.66 --> 8780.28]  Literally me already.
[8780.40 --> 8781.28]  You've never read a book.
[8781.28 --> 8787.14]  I mean, you got a job without it, I guess.
[8790.40 --> 8791.24]  I've read a book.
[8791.38 --> 8791.70]  Maybe.
[8792.00 --> 8793.48]  I mean, that's better than.
[8795.82 --> 8797.04]  Parents still read.
[8797.42 --> 8800.30]  AJ says, I've only read eight books my entire life.
[8800.82 --> 8805.28]  The Harry Potter books plus House of the Scorpion or Sorpian.
[8805.40 --> 8805.80]  Sorpian.
[8805.96 --> 8807.70]  I don't know what House of the Sorpian is.
[8809.80 --> 8810.20]  Oh.
[8811.28 --> 8815.40]  I read Grapes of Wrath and I really wish I hadn't.
[8815.48 --> 8816.82]  I genuinely like think.
[8817.14 --> 8818.34]  A thousand pages.
[8818.60 --> 8820.54]  That you should read.
[8820.90 --> 8826.10]  And this is even someone who has a hard time with it because I think it's good for your
[8826.10 --> 8828.10]  brain to just sit there and have to imagine.
[8829.56 --> 8830.50]  Artie's trolling.
[8830.68 --> 8832.60]  I've read books, but not many in university.
[8833.46 --> 8833.86]  What about.
[8834.92 --> 8839.58]  I mean, are we okay with like Harry Potter's and House of the Dragon and all those sort of
[8839.58 --> 8839.78]  like.
[8839.86 --> 8839.92]  Yeah.
[8839.94 --> 8840.60]  Harry Potter's a book.
[8840.70 --> 8840.92]  It's a book.
[8840.92 --> 8841.60]  My argument is that.
[8841.60 --> 8846.14]  Like we don't have to be like, you know, they don't have to be proper novels.
[8847.20 --> 8848.50]  Harry Potter's a proper novel.
[8848.78 --> 8849.06]  No.
[8849.18 --> 8849.92]  It's for young adults.
[8850.06 --> 8852.52]  I mentioned Grapes of Wrath, right?
[8852.62 --> 8853.30]  Which is like.
[8854.28 --> 8854.80]  A classic.
[8855.14 --> 8856.54]  A classic American.
[8857.88 --> 8858.76]  I've read a book.
[8858.90 --> 8860.48]  I've read Grapes of Wrath.
[8860.48 --> 8860.98]  I don't know.
[8860.98 --> 8861.00]  I don't know.
[8861.00 --> 8861.02]  I don't know.
[8861.02 --> 8865.62]  Honestly speaking, I think a lot of what makes something classic is that it came first.
[8866.62 --> 8870.80]  Like quite frankly, the adventures of Tom Sawyer and the adventures of Huckleberry Finn
[8870.80 --> 8872.30]  kind of suck.
[8872.30 --> 8875.16]  The coming first part matters though, in my opinion.
[8875.84 --> 8877.86]  And like, to be clear, they don't suck.
[8878.06 --> 8882.28]  You know, I'm sure they're full of, you know, rich prose and all those things and stuff.
[8882.32 --> 8883.14]  You're going to upset some people.
[8883.18 --> 8883.84]  But I didn't care.
[8884.20 --> 8888.98]  Like I read them as a kid and I was like, seriously, this is what qualified as like good
[8888.98 --> 8890.52]  kids books those days?
[8890.52 --> 8892.48]  My God, nothing happens.
[8892.48 --> 8894.84]  You know?
[8895.40 --> 8902.14]  So, I, and so I think that, I think that, you know, just because something is more modern
[8902.14 --> 8909.00]  and just because it's full of plot holes and, what?
[8909.28 --> 8910.60]  No, just don't worry about it.
[8910.66 --> 8915.06]  And, and, and like flawed world building, you know, talking about Harry Potter here right
[8915.06 --> 8915.26]  now.
[8915.34 --> 8915.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8915.86 --> 8918.06]  That doesn't make it not valid.
[8918.44 --> 8919.34]  Okay, what?
[8919.80 --> 8921.48]  It's just people are quoting me.
[8922.48 --> 8924.36]  I avoided that one.
[8925.16 --> 8927.08]  The coming first part matters.
[8927.44 --> 8928.44]  Oh my goodness.
[8928.56 --> 8929.58]  Does fan fiction count?
[8929.70 --> 8932.06]  Like, like, I don't know, my immortal and stuff like that.
[8932.20 --> 8934.08]  It was seriously his name.
[8934.80 --> 8935.94]  Yeah, I don't know.
[8936.04 --> 8943.12]  I think the, the literal mental exercise of having to create a world in your, in your brain
[8943.12 --> 8949.68]  to try to visualize it instead of just watching video and having that done for you in, in the
[8949.68 --> 8954.56]  modern day is actually very valuable for, for flexing your creativity muscles and stuff.
[8954.56 --> 8960.62]  I promise you, nobody has made any video content that you enjoy watching.
[8960.62 --> 8962.72]  I'm talking like films, TV shows.
[8963.06 --> 8965.16]  Nobody made those without reading.
[8965.98 --> 8966.32]  Yeah.
[8966.80 --> 8971.62]  Like, it's, it's an important part of being able to create and not just consume.
[8971.62 --> 8975.38]  I listen to audio books all the time.
[8976.18 --> 8977.30]  Tree hallucinations.
[8977.30 --> 8978.92]  Because I get a lot of benefit from that as well.
[8979.02 --> 8980.48]  Yeah, but just, just, you still have to imagine.
[8980.48 --> 8981.64]  Just listening to it?
[8981.74 --> 8984.82]  Like, because when you're reading it, you are solely focused on the page.
[8984.82 --> 8988.12]  If you're just listening to it while you're cooking dinner and like, you're not hallucinating
[8988.12 --> 8988.58]  properly.
[8988.92 --> 8990.34]  Now, am I being a novel purist?
[8990.72 --> 8991.86]  I haven't read in years.
[8992.14 --> 8993.02]  So it's not like I can say much.
[8993.02 --> 8996.28]  No, I think, I think reading is objectively more based than listening to an audio book.
[8996.38 --> 9000.02]  I just sometimes, you know, if I'm driving, I'm going to listen to an audio book and
[9000.02 --> 9001.56]  I'm still, you don't just read behind the wheel?
[9002.52 --> 9006.08]  Just a full, like, hardcover.
[9006.60 --> 9009.94]  Hardcover and then you have your phone taped at the top of it for subway surfers.
[9009.96 --> 9010.32]  Oh, nice.
[9010.42 --> 9010.54]  Good.
[9010.80 --> 9011.00]  Yeah.
[9011.00 --> 9011.28]  Good.
[9011.38 --> 9011.60]  Good.
[9011.68 --> 9011.82]  Yeah.
[9011.88 --> 9015.20]  Because you can't, you shouldn't read without subway surfers.
[9015.92 --> 9016.28]  Yeah.
[9016.50 --> 9016.64]  You should.
[9016.72 --> 9017.00]  You should.
[9017.00 --> 9017.26]  Exactly.
[9017.32 --> 9017.64]  You know.
[9017.82 --> 9019.14]  And I got podcast one ear.
[9019.70 --> 9020.04]  Yeah.
[9020.26 --> 9020.48]  Right.
[9020.62 --> 9020.84]  Good.
[9021.26 --> 9021.50]  Good.
[9021.50 --> 9021.56]  Good.
[9021.78 --> 9024.66]  Corey is the name says there's something to be said for books that break the mold and
[9024.66 --> 9026.34]  redefine entire genres of literature.
[9026.64 --> 9029.94]  They may be weak in comparison to modern equivalents, but those equivalents wouldn't exist
[9029.94 --> 9030.68]  if not for the OG.
[9030.82 --> 9034.40]  And that's fine if you're like a literary historian, but I'm just saying for people who
[9034.40 --> 9038.16]  just like should practice reading so they can flex their reading muscle.
[9038.28 --> 9040.64]  I don't necessarily consider that to be the best use of their time.
[9040.74 --> 9042.28]  We're not talking about learning literature.
[9042.62 --> 9044.32]  Weathering Heights also sucked.
[9044.76 --> 9045.28]  I'm sorry.
[9045.42 --> 9046.00]  It sucks.
[9046.18 --> 9047.34]  It's not good.
[9047.82 --> 9048.96]  I didn't enjoy it.
[9049.06 --> 9049.48]  I'm sorry.
[9050.58 --> 9051.86]  Again, it's like boring.
[9052.08 --> 9056.72]  It moves at a glacial pace and it's like, and it's a high cognitive load to read it because
[9056.72 --> 9060.12]  it uses kind of archaic English and it was not enjoyable.
[9060.12 --> 9060.60]  I'm sorry.
[9061.10 --> 9062.38]  And you're not going to get anybody.
[9062.38 --> 9065.24]  I had a, this was, this was a really good, I forget.
[9065.34 --> 9068.74]  I think I overheard this conversation or no, it was relayed to me by Yvonne.
[9068.74 --> 9077.38]  And it came from one of, there's a, there's a kid that Yvonne and I both know who goes
[9077.38 --> 9080.06]  to a, like a religious school.
[9080.30 --> 9085.44]  And basically you can get some really, you can get some really interesting opinions on
[9085.44 --> 9092.02]  what kind of literature is okay to read from, from people who have, you know, their doctrine
[9092.02 --> 9097.70]  and their, their belief system and who are educators and they can kind of, uh, end up
[9097.70 --> 9103.36]  prescribing a really restrictive diet of literary materials.
[9103.82 --> 9110.92]  And, uh, I was quite surprised based on what I knew about this particular teacher from context,
[9110.92 --> 9116.02]  um, that what they basically said is the best thing for a kid to read is anything that kid
[9116.02 --> 9116.50]  will read.
[9116.58 --> 9116.88]  Yeah.
[9117.12 --> 9117.52]  Yep.
[9117.84 --> 9119.14]  Literally anything.
[9119.14 --> 9120.56]  I don't care.
[9120.70 --> 9127.62]  It can be witchcraft or Minecraft or Minecraft or did I say Minecraft twice?
[9127.62 --> 9128.64]  What's a bunch more Minecraft.
[9129.06 --> 9129.08]  Yeah.
[9129.14 --> 9129.58]  Whatever.
[9129.68 --> 9130.18]  It doesn't matter.
[9130.26 --> 9131.58]  The point is it can be anything.
[9131.84 --> 9135.24]  Just make sure that they learn to bloody read.
[9135.68 --> 9141.98]  And so, you know, yeah, I think if you, if you, if you go and you give kids like, um,
[9142.86 --> 9144.86]  yeah, yeah.
[9144.92 --> 9147.04]  I mean, I'll go, I'll come back to, to my example.
[9147.18 --> 9147.44]  Okay.
[9147.50 --> 9148.18]  Oh, here's one.
[9148.18 --> 9155.76]  I loved the secret world of Aug, um, by Pierre Burton when I was a kid and I went and I tried
[9155.76 --> 9159.22]  to read it to my kids and they just tuned the math out.
[9159.38 --> 9165.36]  It was the, the language was not just maybe at a bit of a high level for what they were
[9165.36 --> 9166.16]  ready for at the time.
[9166.22 --> 9170.14]  So that was part of the problem, but not just that, but it was just, it was, it was written
[9170.14 --> 9173.82]  in an older style and, and they weren't engaged with it.
[9173.94 --> 9177.92]  And I could have insisted, but what would I have done?
[9177.94 --> 9182.18]  I would have just created a negative, a negative reading experience.
[9182.30 --> 9182.52]  Why?
[9182.62 --> 9183.42]  Why are we doing this?
[9183.42 --> 9184.86]  I never liked reading at all.
[9185.48 --> 9188.88]  Um, you know, I've always had problems with that type of stuff.
[9188.94 --> 9190.98]  I was really bad at spelling, all those types of things.
[9191.16 --> 9194.66]  My mom was trying to get me into it because it would have benefited me fairly, obviously.
[9194.66 --> 9200.04]  Um, and I, I don't think she had ever read it before, but she picked up the Hobbit.
[9200.24 --> 9204.90]  If I had to make a guess, she probably picked up the Hobbit because I liked like video games
[9204.90 --> 9205.78]  and fantasy games.
[9206.54 --> 9210.04]  Um, and she's like, well, I don't know, let's try this.
[9210.48 --> 9212.92]  Uh, and loved the Hobbit.
[9213.04 --> 9215.76]  She, she read the Hobbit to me and I was super into it.
[9215.82 --> 9220.08]  And the Hobbit being so good, not the movies.
[9220.08 --> 9224.46]  If you're a young'un who hasn't read the movies sucked, the book was fantastic.
[9224.46 --> 9226.96]  Yeah, the movies were just, um, just butt.
[9227.16 --> 9230.92]  The Hobbit being so good drove me to want to read Lord of the Rings.
[9231.02 --> 9233.02]  And that was really hard.
[9233.74 --> 9236.18]  Not just because of age, but reading ability.
[9236.18 --> 9236.36]  That's a step up.
[9236.64 --> 9240.24]  But it was, the story was so good that I really enjoyed that.
[9240.34 --> 9243.88]  And then I got into the Harry Potter books and then I was started expanding beyond there.
[9243.90 --> 9245.64]  And now reading became like a thing for me.
[9246.00 --> 9250.34]  Um, and despite it being hard, I would take like an entire Saturday and just chill and read.
[9250.46 --> 9252.00]  Cause I'm like, this is great.
[9252.22 --> 9254.24]  I love these worlds that I'm disappearing into.
[9254.24 --> 9256.80]  Man, I wish I had Saturdays like that as an adult.
[9257.06 --> 9257.30]  Yeah.
[9258.00 --> 9258.44]  Anyway.
[9258.82 --> 9259.08]  Yeah.
[9259.26 --> 9261.20]  Fox in a Box suggested SCPs.
[9261.54 --> 9263.06]  Scary stories on the internet.
[9263.46 --> 9264.84]  Does it necessarily have to be a book?
[9265.34 --> 9268.26]  Can it be like fan fiction level stuff?
[9268.36 --> 9268.82]  Can it be?
[9269.26 --> 9271.88]  I think it being a book has value because you want someone to.
[9271.88 --> 9272.32]  Very long.
[9272.84 --> 9273.22]  Yes.
[9273.56 --> 9274.72]  I think that has value.
[9274.72 --> 9280.28]  I also think there's something to be said for it maintaining a certain bar of quality.
[9280.68 --> 9281.38]  Consistent voice.
[9281.68 --> 9284.16]  Like Yvonne has this app called Dream.
[9284.16 --> 9285.16]  Investment in characters.
[9285.18 --> 9286.72]  With an E at the end.
[9286.72 --> 9290.00]  And basically, um, it's like independent writers.
[9290.00 --> 9294.80]  And I think they get a commission from people like buying the next chapter of their stories
[9294.80 --> 9295.80]  and stuff like that.
[9295.80 --> 9301.20]  So like, it honestly seems like kind of pretty constructive for, um, for like amateur writers,
[9301.20 --> 9304.16]  but, oh my God.
[9304.54 --> 9311.64]  Um, like they're just, it's just full of like grammatical errors and, uh, and typos and just
[9311.64 --> 9317.18]  like, um, like you'll just, you'll, it's written by people who've never read.
[9317.38 --> 9322.22]  So you'll, it'll be full of like homonyms that are just like, you read it out loud and
[9322.22 --> 9325.54]  the sentence makes sense, but it's just like, it's just wrong.
[9325.60 --> 9329.74]  I think there's, I think there's something to be said for, I'm not saying that language
[9329.74 --> 9331.42]  isn't evolving and shouldn't evolve.
[9331.52 --> 9332.34]  It absolutely does.
[9332.38 --> 9333.38]  And it absolutely should.
[9333.88 --> 9340.08]  But, um, you know, in the same way that you don't get to take artistic license with a
[9340.08 --> 9345.74]  painting until you like understand fundamentally how to paint, you can't really take artistic
[9345.74 --> 9350.36]  license with language until you understand the basic structures and know how to use them.
[9350.36 --> 9358.02]  Um, and in a lot of cases, um, you know, you, you get carelessness described or disguised
[9358.02 --> 9360.28]  as, um, creativity.
[9360.70 --> 9374.20]  And I, um, I think there's some value to, um, consuming content that has been edited for
[9374.20 --> 9375.88]  clarity and correctness.
[9375.88 --> 9385.02]  Are you writing fan fictions in the floor playing chat, Dan?
[9385.16 --> 9387.72]  This is like the most classic, most famous one.
[9387.88 --> 9388.92]  Is this a copy pasta?
[9389.16 --> 9394.02]  No, this is a, uh, like a massive fan fiction, uh, based on Harry Potter.
[9394.38 --> 9401.70]  And, uh, uh, my immortal is known very far and wide for being a work of none.
[9401.70 --> 9402.96]  I'm not gonna lie.
[9403.02 --> 9403.82]  I thought it was a joke.
[9404.00 --> 9404.20]  No.
[9404.76 --> 9406.14]  I've never read that before.
[9406.24 --> 9411.24]  This makes it a lot better because it is actually unfortunately sincere.
[9411.50 --> 9413.58]  It's like a, the room kind of situation.
[9414.32 --> 9421.86]  Um, my name is ebony darkness, dementia, Raven way, and I have long ebony black hair.
[9422.60 --> 9427.36]  That's how I got my name with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid back and
[9427.36 --> 9429.62]  icy blue eyes, like limpid tears.
[9429.90 --> 9432.36]  And a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee.
[9433.18 --> 9436.28]  And if you don't know who she is, get the hell out of here.
[9436.54 --> 9438.06]  Get the hell out of here.
[9438.08 --> 9438.86]  There's a lot of authoring.
[9438.86 --> 9442.56]  You can't get your name from your long ebony black hair.
[9443.08 --> 9443.30]  Yeah.
[9443.32 --> 9444.28]  That doesn't really work out.
[9444.34 --> 9445.66]  Because you were a baby.
[9446.00 --> 9446.88]  You didn't have that.
[9446.88 --> 9447.78]  You're an actual idiot.
[9448.90 --> 9450.12]  So anyway, there's that.
[9450.38 --> 9451.14]  Um, yeah.
[9452.72 --> 9453.02]  Sick.
[9455.04 --> 9456.90]  Internet historian apparently did a read of it.
[9457.00 --> 9457.12]  Okay.
[9457.12 --> 9458.12]  Phenomenal video.
[9458.26 --> 9458.44]  Yeah.
[9458.56 --> 9461.76]  This is probably, that's probably the best way to consume, uh, my immortal.
[9462.64 --> 9463.08]  Okay.
[9464.28 --> 9465.20]  It sounds like it probably was.
[9465.28 --> 9467.06]  I was not expecting that to happen tonight.
[9467.14 --> 9467.94]  I am so sorry.
[9468.04 --> 9469.24]  The entirety of the internet.
[9471.56 --> 9472.60]  Oh boy.
[9473.00 --> 9475.04]  Uh, Lake Linus Dune.
[9475.16 --> 9479.10]  I'm working towards my doctorate in philosophy, aiming to work in tech.
[9479.10 --> 9483.50]  Do you think my time would be better spent in research and development or policy around
[9483.50 --> 9484.20]  implementation?
[9484.70 --> 9486.52]  Also second role for SC Hoodie.
[9486.52 --> 9487.96]  Probably no more SC Hoodie.
[9488.04 --> 9491.50]  We do have a hoodie based on that pattern coming soon.
[9491.88 --> 9492.90]  You might like it.
[9493.52 --> 9498.16]  Um, as for what you should be working on, I mean, policy around implementation seems like
[9498.16 --> 9502.54]  something someone with philosophy training should probably be working on with all this
[9502.54 --> 9503.74]  AI stuff going on.
[9503.86 --> 9504.02]  Yeah.
[9504.10 --> 9507.84]  But whether anyone's actually willing to pay you to do that when they'd rather just go
[9507.84 --> 9509.78]  in like a wrecking ball.
[9510.10 --> 9511.30]  Um, I don't know.
[9512.34 --> 9513.16]  Good luck though.
[9513.16 --> 9515.44]  And I hope you can make a positive difference in the world.
[9515.60 --> 9517.40]  There are actually companies hiring that role.
[9517.74 --> 9517.92]  Good.
[9518.10 --> 9518.74]  Well, they should.
[9519.46 --> 9519.72]  Yeah.
[9520.06 --> 9520.88]  A lot of them are doing it.
[9520.88 --> 9524.66]  But then they should actually listen instead of just hiring the role and so that.
[9524.86 --> 9525.00]  Oh, no.
[9525.08 --> 9529.46]  A lot of them are doing it in order to try to improve their lobbying efforts.
[9529.60 --> 9529.88]  Oh, good.
[9530.22 --> 9530.52]  Yeah.
[9531.12 --> 9531.34]  Cool.
[9531.54 --> 9532.10]  Well, carry on.
[9532.80 --> 9533.00]  Hi.
[9533.00 --> 9538.16]  I work in tech retail and we get a lot of clients looking for the cheapest systems,
[9538.16 --> 9542.90]  not understanding or wanting to understand that they won't get the functionality they
[9542.90 --> 9543.18]  want.
[9543.34 --> 9544.20]  How do I explain it?
[9544.20 --> 9545.56]  You won't be able to explain it.
[9545.76 --> 9552.00]  The way to handle it is be enthusiastic and be excited about the things that you know are
[9552.00 --> 9553.52]  going to actually make them happy.
[9553.82 --> 9555.04]  Take time to ask questions.
[9555.08 --> 9556.42]  It sounds like you're doing that though.
[9556.78 --> 9560.32]  Like you've taken the time to understand what they want, the functionality they're after.
[9560.32 --> 9565.74]  Um, and so, so you just have to improve your salesmanship.
[9565.98 --> 9568.10]  Be excited about the things that will work.
[9568.28 --> 9571.38]  Be extremely unexcited about the things that won't work.
[9571.98 --> 9572.48]  Warn them.
[9572.98 --> 9577.18]  Tell them you don't want them to waste their money because buying something twice, even
[9577.18 --> 9582.22]  if it's only two thirds of the price costs more than buying something once that actually
[9582.22 --> 9584.56]  works and actually fulfills their needs.
[9585.02 --> 9589.82]  Um, so you just have to kind of try to try to break it down and, um, and do your best.
[9589.82 --> 9593.60]  Every once in a while, someone's going to come in, they're going to have some kind of
[9593.60 --> 9594.18]  expectations.
[9594.18 --> 9597.38]  And what you got to do is you got to say, look, um, this isn't going to work for you,
[9597.38 --> 9602.66]  but it's, uh, clear that it's what you want and you can give it a try.
[9602.76 --> 9603.92]  Here's our return policy.
[9603.92 --> 9608.32]  And, uh, if you come back in, I'd be happy to, um, you know, chat with you and help you
[9608.32 --> 9611.08]  find something that works out better for you, but maybe you'll try it.
[9611.08 --> 9614.50]  And, you know, maybe from our conversation, I've misunderstood exactly what it is that
[9614.50 --> 9616.48]  your expectations are and it'll work just fine for you.
[9616.90 --> 9618.56]  Just leave the conversation open.
[9622.08 --> 9623.76]  And let's see here.
[9623.84 --> 9624.22]  Last one.
[9624.30 --> 9628.18]  I've got LTT number one, precision bits and PTM 7950.
[9628.28 --> 9628.46]  When?
[9629.32 --> 9629.76]  I don't know.
[9631.52 --> 9632.42]  Logistics are a challenge.
[9632.42 --> 9636.26]  I saw someone, uh, in float plane chat earlier saying PTM 7950.
[9636.26 --> 9637.16]  It should be in stock.
[9637.28 --> 9640.18]  I mean, surely there couldn't be a shortage from Honeywell or whatever, but it's Marvel
[9640.18 --> 9641.00]  logistics thing.
[9641.54 --> 9644.92]  Uh, we were really working on trimming down our stock on the store.
[9645.00 --> 9648.08]  And I think we kind of overswung the pendulum that way.
[9648.22 --> 9648.90]  And too enthusiastic.
[9648.98 --> 9649.12]  Yeah.
[9649.12 --> 9653.98]  We need to do a better job of just maintaining a little bit more, uh, stock of just the,
[9653.98 --> 9660.18]  the, the, the run rate items that, uh, that people are, that people are after like,
[9660.18 --> 9660.92]  um,
[9662.86 --> 9664.44]  tall shirts, like tall shirts.
[9664.54 --> 9664.70]  Yeah.
[9664.86 --> 9665.00]  I knew.
[9665.00 --> 9665.44]  Yeah.
[9666.26 --> 9669.18]  Are they all like out of stock?
[9669.52 --> 9670.18]  The tall shirts?
[9670.32 --> 9670.44]  Yeah.
[9670.52 --> 9670.72]  Oh no.
[9670.72 --> 9671.86]  I think the smalls are in.
[9672.24 --> 9673.98]  And we've small and we have nothing else.
[9674.20 --> 9675.32]  For long sleeve.
[9675.32 --> 9676.52]  You have a few options.
[9677.26 --> 9678.38]  Um, for short sleeve.
[9678.48 --> 9679.04]  It's only small.
[9679.14 --> 9681.76]  I have been tracking this often.
[9682.00 --> 9683.38]  The microfiber shirt sold out.
[9684.54 --> 9690.44]  So I think we got the order quantity about right on that one, but, uh, yeah, we'll, um,
[9690.70 --> 9693.30]  we're going to, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to keep getting better
[9693.30 --> 9693.60]  at it.
[9693.60 --> 9696.08]  I think I hope we'll keep trying.
[9697.06 --> 9697.30]  Yeah.
[9699.38 --> 9700.44]  And I think that's it.
[9701.22 --> 9702.42]  We'll see you again next week.
[9703.08 --> 9703.82]  Same bad time.
[9704.22 --> 9704.76]  Same bad channel.
[9704.76 --> 9706.12]  Bye.
[9708.52 --> 9709.96]  Yep.
