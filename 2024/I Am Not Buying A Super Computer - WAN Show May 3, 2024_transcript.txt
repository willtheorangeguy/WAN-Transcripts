[0.88 --> 5.88]  What's up everyone and welcome to the WAD show. We got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[6.36 --> 16.00]  AI powered race cars. Turns out they kind of suck so far. Big surprise. Also, the supercomputer auction has completed and...
[16.56 --> 23.56]  Spoiler, no. No, I didn't buy it and I will explain all of the reasons why as much as I would have loved to.
[23.74 --> 27.84]  That didn't make any sense, guys. It made absolutely no sense. What else we got today?
[27.84 --> 29.84]  Uh...
[31.60 --> 35.74]  Really? You had all this time. I don't know. You had all this time while I made an emergency bathroom break.
[35.76 --> 39.84]  Not gonna lie. I definitely focused on talking to chat instead and all of this is...
[41.44 --> 46.24]  Google Play celebrates Sonic and got every single fact about Sonic wrong?
[46.66 --> 50.20]  Why you gotta focus on the negative? Because it's just funny. Why don't you go with something positive?
[50.44 --> 55.84]  Do we have anything positive in the doc? I mean, Walmart is collaborating with Roblox.
[55.84 --> 58.72]  That's not positive. There's no way that's positive.
[59.52 --> 60.36]  Shrimp Jesus.
[61.12 --> 61.60]  But...
[61.60 --> 69.78]  Alright, the title for that topic is Meta says no more to spam unless it's AI spam.
[70.64 --> 70.96]  Nice.
[71.04 --> 74.00]  And then there's pictures of Jesus made out of shrimp.
[74.88 --> 75.76]  Alright, fair enough.
[75.76 --> 77.82]  Oh...
[77.82 --> 80.38]  Oh...
[80.44 --> 80.78]  Oh...
[80.78 --> 102.24]  The show is brought to you today by Vessi, Squarespace, and Manscaped.
[102.24 --> 107.84]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic, which is, of course, the supercomputer auction.
[108.04 --> 113.50]  Good Lord, if I had a dollar for every single person who sent this bloody thing to me this week.
[113.56 --> 114.30]  You could afford it.
[114.32 --> 115.38]  I could have bought it.
[115.48 --> 115.72]  Yeah.
[115.92 --> 126.68]  The Cheyenne supercomputer has sold, apparently, for $480,085 US dollars.
[126.68 --> 130.48]  This is for sale by, yes, .gov, the US government.
[130.48 --> 133.68]  At one point, I believe it was in the top...
[133.68 --> 136.52]  Ooh, I can't remember exactly, but it was in the...
[136.52 --> 141.26]  I think it was in, like, the top 20 or top 10 supercomputers in the world or something like that.
[141.30 --> 143.94]  It's about seven years old, though, now.
[144.22 --> 150.82]  And if you guys read a little bit more into the details about it, you'll probably figure out why,
[150.82 --> 158.68]  in spite of the fact that it was looking like it might go for as little as about $8,000 US dollars earlier in the week,
[158.68 --> 163.34]  I had no interest whatsoever in bidding on this thing.
[163.44 --> 163.88]  See, I swear to you...
[163.88 --> 167.20]  If it went at $8,000 and you didn't buy it, that would have been a mistake.
[167.70 --> 168.88]  That would have been...
[168.88 --> 172.54]  That would have been maybe a mistake.
[172.62 --> 173.50]  That would have definitely been a mistake.
[173.50 --> 175.60]  That would have been maybe a mistake, okay?
[175.98 --> 177.88]  We need only go as far as...
[178.68 --> 179.96]  Here, let's play a game.
[180.22 --> 181.56]  Let's play a game called,
[181.56 --> 186.76]  How Far Into This Page Do I Need to Read to Know What a Bad Idea It Is to Buy This Thing.
[187.28 --> 188.44]  Cheyenne Supercomputer.
[188.88 --> 190.46]  Looks good so far.
[190.58 --> 191.28]  Item name.
[191.66 --> 192.42]  Can confirm.
[192.52 --> 193.84]  It's good when these things match.
[193.96 --> 194.52]  That is, yeah.
[194.58 --> 195.52]  The sale lot number.
[195.72 --> 197.44]  I mean, that looks like a pretty lucky number.
[197.74 --> 198.70]  Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[200.18 --> 200.62]  Dude.
[201.38 --> 203.88]  It's 28 racks.
[204.84 --> 206.36]  28 racks.
[206.48 --> 207.82]  All liquid cooling.
[208.44 --> 209.50]  That's the E racks.
[209.96 --> 210.76]  The E cells.
[210.76 --> 215.40]  There are 14 units weighing 1,500 pounds each.
[215.60 --> 221.00]  And I have to get this stuff from buttf**k Wyoming up to our warehouse where...
[221.00 --> 222.34]  Here, let's keep reading.
[222.72 --> 233.84]  I will have to find a place to store, yes, 28 rack units containing a total of 145,000 CPU cores that draw...
[233.84 --> 235.90]  And this is a direct quote.
[236.00 --> 237.36]  This is a direct quote here.
[237.36 --> 241.24]  1.7 million watts under load.
[242.76 --> 247.60]  Sir, are you aware that with all of our buildings combined...
[247.60 --> 248.18]  Yeah.
[248.60 --> 252.44]  ...we do not have enough power to actually run this thing?
[252.58 --> 253.30]  Still could have bought it.
[253.44 --> 253.80]  Okay.
[253.98 --> 255.44]  If it was eight grand, you still should have bought it.
[255.50 --> 256.64]  We could have salvaged it.
[256.70 --> 258.14]  But there are more issues.
[258.24 --> 258.64]  Hold on.
[258.70 --> 260.02]  Because we can keep reading.
[260.66 --> 261.60]  Let's keep reading.
[261.60 --> 265.88]  Moving the system necessitates the engagement of a professional moving company.
[265.98 --> 270.56]  In fact, I don't believe that the buyer is even allowed on the premises.
[271.28 --> 272.04]  So that's something.
[272.04 --> 272.30]  Wait.
[272.94 --> 273.30]  Yeah.
[273.40 --> 274.80]  Because it has to be a professional...
[274.80 --> 275.92]  It's a data center.
[276.24 --> 277.64]  It's a highly secure area.
[278.16 --> 278.48]  Okay?
[278.58 --> 279.32]  So there's that.
[279.66 --> 280.06]  And then...
[280.06 --> 280.36]  No, no.
[280.40 --> 281.22]  It gets even better.
[281.30 --> 282.08]  It gets even better.
[282.12 --> 284.24]  Aside from these being outdated AF.
[284.62 --> 289.92]  Like, we're talking Haswell-grade CPUs here with DDR4-2400.
[289.92 --> 292.40]  This thing is flipping slow.
[292.92 --> 300.62]  It took a team of, I believe it was a little less than 20 dedicated engineers to run maintenance
[300.62 --> 301.40]  on this thing.
[302.14 --> 302.28]  And...
[302.28 --> 303.56]  I'm not saying you should have ran it.
[303.56 --> 307.60]  And they've been having issues with that maintenance to the point where they're saying,
[307.70 --> 312.48]  hmm, it's kind of costing more to run this thing than it's worth because their liquid
[312.48 --> 315.78]  cooling has apparently been leaking all over the place.
[316.66 --> 317.14]  That'd be surprising.
[317.14 --> 317.40]  This thing...
[317.40 --> 319.66]  This thing is a clusterf**k.
[319.92 --> 327.24]  And it seemed like there were some people out there who were serious about buying a supercomputer
[327.24 --> 330.22]  and, like, running it.
[330.54 --> 331.52]  Oh, yeah, no.
[331.60 --> 333.48]  And I'm looking at this thing going...
[333.48 --> 333.72]  No.
[333.98 --> 342.28]  Brother, if you know anything about operating a supercomputer, you know that nobody is buying
[342.28 --> 343.24]  this thing to run it.
[343.34 --> 347.44]  $480,000 is honestly a scrap price.
[347.58 --> 348.20]  Yeah, 100%.
[348.20 --> 350.52]  You are ripping cabling out of it.
[350.76 --> 353.16]  You are ripping CPUs and memory modules.
[353.28 --> 354.62]  That is going straight to eBay.
[354.94 --> 363.12]  You're not operating this thing because anyone who has the kind of money to pay the $60,000
[363.12 --> 370.16]  US dollars a month that it is estimated just to put electricity in this thing's digital veins...
[370.16 --> 372.46]  And find a place that you can even get that electricity.
[372.68 --> 373.76]  Don't forget the cooling.
[373.98 --> 378.14]  If you have that kind of money, you can afford new f**king hardware.
[378.58 --> 384.86]  You are not buying somebody's, like, ratted-out Civic of a supercomputer...
[384.86 --> 385.22]  But...
[385.22 --> 387.16]  And trying to lease out space on it.
[387.18 --> 388.58]  That's just not how this works.
[388.58 --> 388.90]  But...
[388.90 --> 391.94]  Six years ago, you made a video on the SFU supercomputer.
[392.12 --> 392.60]  I did.
[392.68 --> 395.72]  And that got 2.5 million views, and it was six years ago.
[395.74 --> 395.98]  Okay.
[396.14 --> 398.16]  2.5 million views.
[398.32 --> 401.80]  Just for context, ladies and gentlemen, in the tech vertical...
[401.80 --> 401.92]  Hold on.
[401.92 --> 405.68]  In the tech vertical, it's worth about five grand.
[406.42 --> 406.84]  So...
[406.84 --> 407.28]  Okay.
[407.46 --> 409.06]  But you know that's not how the math works.
[409.06 --> 409.38]  No.
[409.56 --> 410.32]  Come on now.
[410.32 --> 412.30]  The math's a little more favorable than that.
[412.38 --> 421.72]  But if I spent more than probably 50 to 100 grand on this thing, I better be profiting
[421.72 --> 423.36]  on the teardown of it.
[423.46 --> 424.92]  Because otherwise, I'm underwater.
[425.16 --> 425.76]  Which gets...
[425.76 --> 426.26]  I'm underwater.
[426.40 --> 427.08]  I agree at that range.
[427.08 --> 428.64]  Even if I make a number of videos, guys.
[428.66 --> 429.68]  That's not one video.
[429.84 --> 429.94]  Yeah.
[430.08 --> 431.14]  You've got to be getting...
[431.14 --> 431.62]  That's a number of videos.
[431.62 --> 433.12]  Like three to five videos.
[433.12 --> 433.98]  I'm doing a series.
[434.24 --> 434.38]  Yeah.
[434.48 --> 436.14]  It's a pickup vlog.
[436.46 --> 438.80]  We're driving to Wyoming, boys!
[439.70 --> 443.96]  It's that Mr. Beast intro where the camera whips out, and you've got this huge semi behind
[443.96 --> 444.20]  you.
[444.32 --> 446.26]  I'm in an abandoned supercomputer!
[446.62 --> 449.48]  Meanwhile, it's like six minutes from the nearest micro center.
[451.18 --> 452.00]  A hundred percent.
[453.28 --> 458.06]  But yeah, the other problem is if you're parting it out, you'd have to part it out in the States.
[458.62 --> 458.92]  Oh, yeah.
[458.98 --> 460.52]  And you'd have to film all your content in the States.
[460.52 --> 461.30]  Yeah, what I'm going to...
[461.30 --> 462.56]  He's going to bring it over the border?
[462.56 --> 463.60]  ...import this mess?
[463.70 --> 463.98]  Yeah.
[464.08 --> 465.20]  You've got to be kidding me.
[465.24 --> 465.94]  There's no way.
[466.06 --> 466.86]  There's no way.
[468.14 --> 470.52]  It was a fun thing to dream about.
[470.68 --> 470.80]  Yeah.
[470.80 --> 476.08]  It's one of those things where it's like, oh, man, wouldn't it be cool to open a gaming
[476.08 --> 481.84]  hotel or start a gaming peripheral business?
[481.84 --> 487.26]  Like, oh, I had a cool idea and a fever dream, and I woke up in the middle of the night and
[487.26 --> 492.76]  I went, oh, wait, a half a million dollars for what is essentially a gigantic pile of
[492.76 --> 493.72]  leaky e-waste.
[493.94 --> 494.80]  Yeah, there's no way at that point.
[494.90 --> 497.28]  No, it doesn't make any sense.
[497.28 --> 498.74]  But you know what?
[498.94 --> 500.28]  I definitely...
[500.28 --> 502.88]  Oh, I didn't think of that.
[503.22 --> 503.48]  What?
[503.92 --> 505.78]  Travis Social in the float plane chat.
[506.98 --> 508.18]  You could write it off.
[509.68 --> 510.28]  I could...
[510.88 --> 511.90]  Free content.
[512.12 --> 512.54]  I could...
[512.54 --> 514.12]  I could have written it off.
[514.18 --> 515.18]  And gotten like five videos.
[515.64 --> 516.54]  I could...
[516.54 --> 520.34]  I've made a terrible mistake.
[520.38 --> 521.26]  You ought to think harder, man.
[524.42 --> 528.24]  There's like almost no chance, but if the person who bought it reached out, would you like
[528.24 --> 530.30]  do any content on it?
[530.48 --> 531.74]  I mean, yeah, I'd be super down.
[531.84 --> 532.02]  Yeah.
[532.36 --> 532.98]  Yeah, of course.
[533.14 --> 533.68]  All right, people.
[534.08 --> 535.52]  Let's figure out who the heck bought this.
[535.94 --> 536.76]  Realistically, though.
[536.78 --> 537.42]  It probably has some...
[537.42 --> 537.60]  Yeah.
[537.86 --> 539.70]  Yeah, there's no...
[539.70 --> 549.04]  This is basically one of those like e-computer-shop-dot-whatever, like eBay stores.
[549.04 --> 550.80]  And they're ripping it apart.
[550.92 --> 554.48]  There's no way that anybody is actually going to try to operate this thing.
[554.56 --> 556.08]  It is woefully out of date.
[556.20 --> 559.48]  Their high RAM units have 256 gigs.
[559.84 --> 561.82]  I mean, there are gaming PCs out there.
[561.90 --> 562.76]  Albeit not many.
[563.06 --> 567.72]  But there are gaming PCs out there that have 256 gigs of RAM in them these days.
[567.72 --> 570.20]  Like, this is not aged well.
[570.68 --> 576.76]  And especially, it has not aged well with the way that the workloads for these supercomputers
[576.76 --> 578.38]  have evolved in the last seven years.
[578.68 --> 580.88]  There is a reason this is being decommissioned.
[581.06 --> 587.62]  This thing is a CPU supercomputer, which, ladies and gentlemen, is not how they build them right
[587.62 --> 587.92]  now.
[588.26 --> 593.48]  As far as I could tell, didn't really have any GPU compute units in it.
[593.48 --> 596.24]  And it's also not designed with systems.
[596.38 --> 601.34]  Even that SFU supercomputer that I checked out six years ago had systems that had a terabyte
[601.34 --> 603.44]  or two terabytes or something of memory in them.
[603.76 --> 606.98]  They were either four-way or eight-way CPU systems.
[606.98 --> 607.14]  Oh, wow.
[607.44 --> 611.34]  So that they could have these gigantic pools of memory so that they could work on extremely
[611.34 --> 612.22]  large data sets.
[612.30 --> 617.34]  As far as I can tell, Cheyenne didn't have any such nodes and didn't have any such capabilities.
[617.34 --> 624.46]  So as data sets have grown and as the need for GPU compute for these supercomputing systems
[624.46 --> 634.26]  has grown, it has become not just out of date in terms of how long it's been since the hardware
[634.26 --> 640.58]  was released, but it has become outdated in terms of the overall design philosophy of the
[640.58 --> 642.80]  system, in terms of the architecture of the system.
[642.80 --> 645.24]  It just didn't make any sense.
[645.40 --> 647.60]  But that could be kind of a fun video.
[647.66 --> 648.20]  It was a lot of fun.
[648.26 --> 651.28]  Oh, and apparently does have 184 GPUs.
[651.46 --> 654.86]  Schraff says 73 RTX 4090s outperformed this machine.
[655.00 --> 661.16]  It could be kind of a fun video to like try to build, like set up a like we built the like
[661.16 --> 662.12]  Cheyenne supercomputer.
[662.38 --> 664.18]  That's actually, that's a really good idea.
[664.26 --> 667.28]  And if I'd thought of it, we probably would have gotten started on that this week.
[667.28 --> 670.42]  I do wonder if we've missed the moment a little bit at this point.
[670.96 --> 671.90]  Like if we had thrown.
[671.90 --> 673.04]  Now that the auction's actually over.
[673.08 --> 673.24]  Yeah.
[673.28 --> 678.92]  If we'd thrown together a cluster just of like random, random motherboards and just loaded
[678.92 --> 683.74]  up as many GPUs as we could have and frigging like, like Ethernet cabled them together and
[683.74 --> 687.22]  been like, okay, I bought a supercomputer, but it isn't what you think.
[687.22 --> 687.88]  It isn't that one.
[689.98 --> 690.82]  That'd be pretty funny.
[690.90 --> 692.70]  But yeah, it's, it probably missed the mark a little bit.
[692.70 --> 693.10]  Yeah.
[693.90 --> 696.70]  A hundred, 1,680 petaflops.
[696.82 --> 697.42]  I mean, yeah.
[697.50 --> 703.62]  What's a, what's a, what's a 7950X petaflops?
[704.76 --> 705.60]  Oh my goodness.
[705.70 --> 707.48]  What is my, what is my browser doing?
[707.56 --> 709.22]  Do I look old enough that I need that?
[710.28 --> 713.36]  Um, yeah, it doesn't say, I guess that would be, uh, that would be teraflops.
[714.64 --> 715.56]  Here, let's try it.
[715.58 --> 716.46]  Let's try teraflops.
[716.54 --> 716.84]  I don't know.
[716.84 --> 718.28]  I don't know how many flops it has.
[719.06 --> 720.54]  How many, how many flops you got boys?
[720.54 --> 723.82]  Turns out nobody cares about the flops of CPUs anymore.
[724.06 --> 724.30]  All right.
[724.38 --> 724.88]  Well, whatever.
[724.96 --> 725.44]  I'm over it.
[725.76 --> 726.04]  Okay.
[726.06 --> 727.28]  Why don't we move on to our next topic?
[727.34 --> 728.42]  What do you want to talk about?
[729.14 --> 732.20]  Uh, mostly, mostly your topics, but.
[732.48 --> 732.76]  Sure.
[732.94 --> 736.08]  Let's see what, let's do the, you have, you have Tarkov update in here.
[736.14 --> 736.70]  What's up with that?
[736.84 --> 738.22]  Oh, I was just wondering what happened.
[738.36 --> 739.92]  I haven't been paying attention to it.
[739.92 --> 746.38]  What I realized was that we talk about really bad news in the community sometimes, and we don't
[746.38 --> 750.60]  really come back and revisit it the following week to see if like maybe something went better.
[750.70 --> 755.02]  Like back when we were talking about the problems I was having with my, uh, with my light switches.
[755.74 --> 759.82]  And, and we, we did ultimately do an update where we're like, oh yeah, the company has actually
[759.82 --> 761.54]  done the right thing and released the firmware.
[761.78 --> 763.10]  Jazzco, that's, that's who they are.
[763.44 --> 768.28]  And I realized we, we don't always come back and say, hey, they did a really positive thing
[768.28 --> 772.68]  and everything's going good now, which from the look on your face, I'm thinking probably
[772.68 --> 774.78]  isn't what we're about to discuss.
[774.90 --> 776.76]  So what's Battlestate Games been up to this week?
[776.78 --> 777.96]  Yeah, no need this time.
[778.12 --> 784.34]  Uh, they, they, there's been multiple attempts at addressing the issue.
[784.86 --> 786.60]  Um, there, there's a bunch of things.
[786.66 --> 789.52]  There's certain things that we didn't get to address last time, like them editing their
[789.52 --> 789.86]  website.
[789.98 --> 790.74]  Did we talk about that?
[790.96 --> 791.20]  No.
[791.42 --> 796.44]  So they, they edit their website to take certain wording away from different versions that they
[796.44 --> 800.08]  had had in the past, which would have made what they're currently doing, like not okay.
[800.22 --> 803.62]  So what I would like to know is, are they aware of archive.org?
[804.22 --> 806.56]  Yeah, like apparently not because they even.
[806.56 --> 809.14]  Like do they know that that exists, that that's definitely a thing that exists?
[809.26 --> 810.28]  They were asked in an interview.
[810.28 --> 810.96]  I'm just curious.
[811.14 --> 812.00]  After they did it.
[812.06 --> 812.84]  Have they heard of that?
[813.74 --> 817.08]  They were asked in an interview after they did it, if they had done it and they said no.
[817.26 --> 818.80]  So I actually think maybe no.
[819.26 --> 819.52]  Wow.
[819.52 --> 823.98]  Because I think they don't realize that people can prove that they did it, which is, uh.
[824.08 --> 824.96]  That's pretty funny.
[825.08 --> 825.36]  I mean.
[825.48 --> 826.16]  Pretty great.
[826.44 --> 828.52]  Are they Russia based?
[829.96 --> 831.28]  Oh, it's one of those.
[831.80 --> 831.92]  Yeah.
[832.00 --> 832.54]  It's complicated.
[832.78 --> 836.80]  The company is technically incorporated, as far as my understanding goes, in the UK.
[837.16 --> 837.50]  Right.
[838.44 --> 841.26]  But where, you know, where are their devs based?
[841.56 --> 842.34]  It's a Russian company.
[842.40 --> 842.78]  Okay.
[842.90 --> 843.12]  Okay.
[843.28 --> 847.18]  Well, I mean, in fairness to them then, in Russia, you can just disappear things.
[848.30 --> 849.78]  And they stay disappeared.
[851.22 --> 851.74]  Yeah.
[851.88 --> 853.60]  Unfortunately, it's the interwebs.
[853.60 --> 856.58]  Um, so that didn't work out so great.
[856.88 --> 862.52]  Uh, there's been multiple updates and I don't know if all of them are super findable anymore,
[862.52 --> 867.42]  but essentially we've progressively gotten to where we are now.
[867.42 --> 869.12]  Uh, where are we now?
[869.38 --> 869.76]  Oh, wait.
[869.76 --> 872.06]  Is this a new update that I haven't even seen?
[872.06 --> 879.98]  Have they done a complete 180 and agreed to give everyone who bought the $150 edition, the $250 unheard edition?
[880.30 --> 883.56]  Like, like, is, are they actually doing what they said they would do in the first place?
[883.56 --> 889.14]  So, sort of, except in the meantime, they kind of made it worse.
[890.06 --> 891.04]  Oh, brilliant.
[891.40 --> 898.88]  So, so anyone who whistle, whistle blew from inside Battlestate games got disappeared, like, uh, like as if they were talking about airplanes or what?
[898.88 --> 907.50]  See, I love that you use the term whistle blow because they added a weird new device into the game, um, that they're calling the legacy device.
[907.50 --> 911.36]  Now, remember, this is supposed to be a Tarkov for people that don't play.
[911.36 --> 912.48]  The legacy device?
[912.66 --> 914.22]  Yeah, I don't know why it's called that, but, um.
[914.22 --> 915.66]  Like, it's a, like it's an item?
[915.94 --> 916.08]  Yeah.
[916.08 --> 916.92]  An in-game item.
[917.04 --> 917.18]  Yes.
[917.18 --> 919.10]  Like, you carry it or it's a gun or, like, what is it?
[919.12 --> 920.28]  Some form of in-game.
[920.34 --> 924.94]  They just say unique item with call-in mechanics and I'll explain the call-in mechanics in a second.
[925.50 --> 932.98]  Can I just say for a moment that the moment Call of Duty died for me was the second that you could just order airstrikes?
[933.30 --> 934.04]  Oh, yeah.
[934.26 --> 935.94]  And take out your, what was that, COD 4?
[935.94 --> 936.96]  Or Modern Warfare?
[937.16 --> 937.36]  Uh, Modern Warfare.
[937.50 --> 938.50]  Oh, the original Modern Warfare.
[938.88 --> 939.94]  Original Modern Warfare.
[940.06 --> 943.66]  I played it for, like, two weeks and I was like, this is f***ing stupid.
[944.20 --> 947.18]  I'm sorry, you don't even have to point your gun at the other guy yet?
[947.24 --> 957.12]  I mean, as gamers, as gamers, we've reached the point where we even, like, being slack-jawed in our desk like this,
[957.62 --> 961.68]  moving the mouse to click the head of the other guy is too much work.
[961.68 --> 963.72]  That's unheard edition Tarkov players.
[963.94 --> 964.68]  All right, fine.
[964.80 --> 966.66]  Okay, so, so, so you got this item.
[966.66 --> 973.02]  Okay, so, but yeah, before, before we get to that, just in case people don't know about Tarkov so much, it's an extremely hardcore game.
[973.22 --> 973.32]  Yeah.
[973.32 --> 976.12]  Uh, it's supposed to have, you know, a touch of realism.
[976.12 --> 978.86]  It's still a video game, so it's supposed to be fun, but there's supposed to be a touch of realism.
[979.02 --> 990.22]  Yeah, but like, you reload, you can't just, like, shoot two rounds and then, like, throw in a new magazine and, like, magically the rounds teleported from the new one to the old one.
[990.22 --> 995.44]  You, like, took out a magazine that now has 28 rounds in it and you put in one with 30.
[996.00 --> 996.14]  Yeah.
[996.20 --> 998.36]  Like, you, and that one still has 28 in it.
[998.48 --> 998.64]  Yeah, like, it's...
[998.64 --> 1000.04]  Even if you have loose rounds in your pockets.
[1000.14 --> 1000.28]  Yeah.
[1000.28 --> 1004.16]  Like, it's, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a very, very hardcore game.
[1004.26 --> 1007.84]  And if you die in that game, you lose nearly everything on you.
[1007.84 --> 1014.20]  There's a couple small slots that you can retain, but almost everything that was on you is, is now permanently gone.
[1015.74 --> 1023.52]  Except, as we talked about last week, the Unheard Edition, this new $250 edition, you can call in, like, teammate reinforcements.
[1024.06 --> 1024.38]  What's a teammate reinforcement?
[1024.38 --> 1025.48]  With one of their abilities.
[1025.88 --> 1027.38]  So, like, you can be in a raid.
[1027.50 --> 1030.20]  Say, say I was playing and then you jumped in Discord.
[1030.32 --> 1033.10]  I could be like, oh, hey, and then I could call you into the raid that I'm currently playing.
[1033.12 --> 1033.44]  Shut up.
[1033.68 --> 1035.28]  The biggest problem with that.
[1035.28 --> 1035.90]  Shut up.
[1035.90 --> 1037.20]  By an enormous amount.
[1037.86 --> 1042.04]  Is that cheaters, they'll often sell their services.
[1042.82 --> 1046.22]  Because there's been a decent amount of stuff that's been put in place to stop.
[1046.22 --> 1047.76]  So you can have cheater sherpas.
[1048.42 --> 1048.66]  Yeah.
[1049.12 --> 1050.98]  So the cheaters can clear the whole lobby.
[1051.88 --> 1053.56]  And then you just go pick up the pieces.
[1053.84 --> 1054.92]  And then you just, yeah.
[1056.36 --> 1059.36]  And that's definitely how it's going to be used.
[1059.90 --> 1064.86]  That's, and they'll sell a lot of Unheard Editions to cheaters that they'll then ban later.
[1064.86 --> 1066.32]  And then we'll buy more Unheard Editions.
[1066.40 --> 1067.26]  That'll totally happen.
[1067.26 --> 1071.88]  Because now there's a commercial incentive to own Unheard Edition.
[1072.10 --> 1072.24]  Yeah.
[1072.30 --> 1074.76]  Because you can sell people loot more easily and faster.
[1075.08 --> 1076.56]  And kind of on their demand.
[1076.68 --> 1082.76]  And if they're looking for a particular item that's really rare, you could have like a list of clients that want different things.
[1082.84 --> 1083.60]  Go into raids.
[1083.76 --> 1084.22]  Clear them.
[1084.42 --> 1085.02]  Check the loot.
[1085.02 --> 1088.30]  And then call in the people that need the particular items.
[1088.70 --> 1092.06]  Like it's, it's really bad and a disgustingly terrible idea.
[1092.46 --> 1094.68]  Now, that was already, we already knew about that.
[1094.78 --> 1095.56]  That was already a thing.
[1095.88 --> 1096.06]  Yeah.
[1096.30 --> 1098.24]  Now, they're like trying to say sorry.
[1098.40 --> 1099.98]  So they're like, okay, Edge of Darkness owner.
[1100.08 --> 1103.34]  So this is the, the people that bought this really expensive copy of the game.
[1103.34 --> 1104.86]  $150 copy of the game.
[1104.98 --> 1108.84]  Most people bought this because it said you get all future DLC for free.
[1108.98 --> 1109.18]  Yes.
[1109.18 --> 1110.80]  So it was like, I'm buying into this game.
[1110.88 --> 1112.86]  I have this, this is my like effectively lifetime license.
[1112.86 --> 1115.28]  It's like buying a Plex lifetime pass or like.
[1115.44 --> 1115.60]  Yeah.
[1115.70 --> 1116.22]  Yeah, sure.
[1116.26 --> 1119.16]  It's more expensive than it like probably should be, but you get all this stuff later.
[1119.20 --> 1119.38]  Sure.
[1119.42 --> 1125.76]  But it's not priced ridiculously compared to other lifetime licenses for as a service products.
[1125.82 --> 1125.96]  Yeah.
[1125.96 --> 1131.26]  So I can, I can at least kind of see where people are coming from with this one.
[1131.38 --> 1131.52]  Yeah.
[1132.06 --> 1133.50]  Now they released this new version.
[1133.58 --> 1134.24]  You don't get everything.
[1134.36 --> 1135.02]  So they're frustrated.
[1135.02 --> 1139.48]  So they said, okay, we're going to give, you know, the co-op PVE mode to Edge of Darkness people.
[1139.58 --> 1140.46]  That was a big issue.
[1140.54 --> 1143.28]  They're like, we're going to do it in waves, whatever, but it is coming to you guys.
[1143.36 --> 1146.68]  And a lot of the other things that they announced for the Unheard Edition, not everything, but
[1146.68 --> 1149.56]  a lot of it, they're like, okay, we're going to give it to Edge of Darkness people.
[1149.72 --> 1154.66]  And then they have this random line that says unique item with call in mechanics, legacy
[1154.66 --> 1158.40]  device, ability to call in a friendly BTR.
[1159.02 --> 1160.98]  Once called, the item will go on cooldown.
[1160.98 --> 1166.64]  A BTR is, um, if you don't immediately know what that is.
[1166.64 --> 1167.16]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[1167.26 --> 1168.48]  I don't know what a BTR is.
[1168.62 --> 1169.54]  It's one of these.
[1170.32 --> 1171.48]  Are you kidding me?
[1174.22 --> 1179.44]  So basically they're turning Tarkov into like, like what?
[1179.54 --> 1180.64]  I can't even, I can't.
[1181.06 --> 1181.30]  Yeah.
[1181.34 --> 1182.08]  Into like COD.
[1182.14 --> 1184.00]  Like how does that make any sense?
[1184.28 --> 1186.70]  You want to be, imagine you're in a fight with someone.
[1187.10 --> 1187.46]  Yeah.
[1187.60 --> 1189.26]  And you're like, they have some pretty hard cover.
[1189.26 --> 1191.52]  You have some pretty hard cover, but you're, you're trying to go at each other.
[1191.52 --> 1196.78]  And then you just hear this like legacy device pop off and you're like, well, I guess a armored
[1196.78 --> 1202.52]  vehicle is going to come and wipe me out in this game, which, and like other people have
[1202.52 --> 1207.86]  pointed out, not only is this a ridiculously egregious pay to win mechanic, like obviously
[1207.86 --> 1215.40]  because the lower, more basic tiers of the game don't get this, but it's also makes no
[1215.40 --> 1217.76]  sense for the lore of the game at all.
[1218.00 --> 1218.30]  Yeah.
[1218.52 --> 1222.12]  Cause you're supposed to be like completely cut off from command and all this other kind
[1222.12 --> 1222.42]  of stuff.
[1222.76 --> 1225.84]  And now you're calling in like an armored vehicle.
[1226.28 --> 1232.26]  And for whatever reason it gets loaded onto like a SpaceX rocket and arrives immediately.
[1232.78 --> 1233.18]  Yeah.
[1234.24 --> 1237.92]  I just, the whole thing is like, what a clown show.
[1237.92 --> 1238.44]  I don't know.
[1238.58 --> 1246.64]  It's, it's, it doesn't seem like it would have been that hard to fix this, but now they've
[1246.64 --> 1252.86]  screwed up fixing it so many times that now I think it's going to be very difficult to
[1252.86 --> 1253.60]  try to fix this.
[1253.88 --> 1256.70]  There's also now they've promised this stupid truck.
[1256.70 --> 1263.82]  And so anyone they promised it to now wants it because let's face it, pay to win, pay
[1263.82 --> 1272.80]  to win game mechanics work because losers, no offense, losers buy them so that they can
[1272.80 --> 1275.14]  not have to get good or whatever.
[1275.46 --> 1279.66]  And look, like, look, look, I'm not the kind of person that's going to sit and be all sweaty
[1279.66 --> 1282.94]  at a game and it'd be like, get good.
[1283.04 --> 1284.06]  Oh, pay to win.
[1284.06 --> 1289.64]  And if a game is just really hard and the community is like super into it and intense,
[1290.06 --> 1293.50]  I'm also not going to pay to be competitive.
[1293.50 --> 1296.04]  Like, oh, my bullets do two times as much damage or whatever.
[1296.16 --> 1301.34]  Like, no, I understand that at some point I'm going to kind of age out of being able
[1301.34 --> 1303.94]  to play whatever the hippest e-sports game is.
[1303.98 --> 1305.92]  And I'm, I'm just not going to be competitive at it.
[1306.08 --> 1311.30]  And no, you don't have to give me like a, like a, oh, I heard you spend eight hours out
[1311.30 --> 1313.72]  of your day working instead of just playing video games.
[1313.72 --> 1317.86]  Here, how about we just take half of what you made today so that you can feel like a
[1317.86 --> 1319.16]  big shot against the kid?
[1319.22 --> 1320.82]  Like, what, what even is this?
[1320.92 --> 1324.82]  What twisted mindset is making people buy these mechanics?
[1325.70 --> 1328.42]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's demented to me.
[1328.48 --> 1332.18]  I mean, the real solution, the proper solution is better matchmaking.
[1332.18 --> 1336.14]  Obviously, just have the casual dads.
[1336.48 --> 1340.94]  Often they're like crappy server where they can just spray and pray all over the place
[1340.94 --> 1344.66]  and then put all the skilled players in the, in the same, in the same lobby.
[1344.66 --> 1350.28]  Like it's, it's very doable and some games do it very well, but I guess it's more work
[1350.28 --> 1356.28]  and it's less lucrative and people will give you money for these kinds of silly upgrades.
[1356.28 --> 1358.26]  So I guess that's why it keeps perpetuating.
[1358.38 --> 1363.68]  And again, it comes back to what we said last week, guys, don't give the money for it.
[1364.44 --> 1367.76]  Like, man, grow a backbone.
[1367.94 --> 1368.88]  Good Lord gamers.
[1369.06 --> 1374.80]  But, but those people who buy into those mechanics now that Battlestate has promised it, well,
[1374.84 --> 1375.58]  their backs to a wall.
[1375.68 --> 1377.28]  Now their game is just ruined.
[1377.90 --> 1378.30]  Yeah.
[1378.84 --> 1383.02]  Because unless they give it to everyone, then it's not fair.
[1383.16 --> 1385.94]  And once they do give it to everyone, it's modern warfare.
[1385.94 --> 1387.14]  Then the game's ridiculous.
[1387.44 --> 1387.56]  Yeah.
[1387.62 --> 1387.78]  Yeah.
[1387.86 --> 1390.20]  Oh, well, now we need an escalation point.
[1390.34 --> 1394.92]  I paid $250 for my addition to the game and now you gave this stupid truck to everybody.
[1395.10 --> 1400.32]  Well, now I need a satellite death laser because otherwise, what's the point of me paying $250?
[1401.48 --> 1402.84]  Did someone find it?
[1403.40 --> 1403.98]  What now?
[1403.98 --> 1405.86]  Oh no, I think they, yeah, they Rick rolled me.
[1406.02 --> 1407.10]  Oh, I got wrecked.
[1407.10 --> 1407.46]  No.
[1408.24 --> 1408.64]  Nice.
[1408.76 --> 1409.12]  Okay.
[1409.20 --> 1413.62]  So there's some interview with him with Nikita, the, the, like, I think he's the COO, but he's
[1413.62 --> 1414.86]  the main person that talks publicly.
[1415.68 --> 1417.84]  There's some interview with him from a long time ago.
[1418.10 --> 1419.34]  I can't find it right now.
[1419.42 --> 1421.40]  I swear I'm not hallucinating this, but.
[1422.68 --> 1423.70]  Is Luke an AI?
[1424.96 --> 1425.98]  This topic next.
[1426.16 --> 1432.80]  He's talking about how cheaters, he had like a, a, a realization that cheaters are actually
[1432.80 --> 1434.00]  a good thing for your game.
[1434.64 --> 1442.68]  Because when your player base is like stressed out and uncomfortable with the cheater situation,
[1442.68 --> 1445.28]  it increases what he calls donations.
[1445.28 --> 1449.06]  And I'm like, wow, you know what?
[1449.64 --> 1449.96]  Donations?
[1450.04 --> 1450.86]  This kind of makes a lot of sense.
[1450.86 --> 1451.72]  What's a donation?
[1451.96 --> 1455.18]  I think, I think that's when he used to make mobile games.
[1455.88 --> 1458.92]  So I think he was talking about like, uh, pay to win mechanics.
[1458.92 --> 1461.20]  They're going to buy them more if there's cheaters in the game.
[1461.92 --> 1462.64]  Oh my God.
[1462.64 --> 1464.46]  I'm not a hundred percent certain.
[1464.58 --> 1467.54]  I'm trying to find the interview, but I can't find it right now.
[1467.72 --> 1470.92]  I know it was on the subreddit before, but I'm having a hard time trying to find it.
[1471.22 --> 1473.56]  That is, that actually hurts my brain.
[1474.04 --> 1476.06]  You have successfully hurt my brain.
[1476.44 --> 1478.82]  Luke, it's Friday and you hurt my brain.
[1479.32 --> 1480.08]  It's a good time.
[1480.16 --> 1482.02]  You can recover before the week starts.
[1482.04 --> 1483.48]  Why would you do that to me?
[1484.10 --> 1485.32]  What did I do to you?
[1486.38 --> 1487.94]  I hate that so much.
[1487.94 --> 1490.54]  So, so, so hold on, hold on.
[1490.64 --> 1491.42]  Tinfoil hat.
[1491.42 --> 1494.12]  Tinfoil hat coming on right now.
[1494.58 --> 1498.56]  Cheating exists in video games to sell microtransactions.
[1498.56 --> 1502.92]  So I have to say one, I need to actually find this video and two, it's a translation from
[1502.92 --> 1503.26]  Russian.
[1503.60 --> 1503.88]  Right.
[1503.96 --> 1505.36]  So the translation could be wrong.
[1505.74 --> 1505.98]  Right.
[1506.04 --> 1507.76]  So like, I don't know a hundred percent.
[1508.06 --> 1509.00]  Oh, did people just find it?
[1509.08 --> 1509.62]  I think they did.
[1509.68 --> 1510.58]  Am I getting Rickrolled again?
[1511.12 --> 1512.36]  This is not what I'm talking about.
[1512.38 --> 1513.34]  Not the text interview.
[1513.72 --> 1514.12]  Okay.
[1514.24 --> 1515.18]  It's a, there's a video.
[1515.56 --> 1519.54]  Anyways, we don't have to try to hunt it down, but there's a, so there's, there's some
[1519.54 --> 1522.12]  very active communities forming right now.
[1522.96 --> 1523.24]  Um.
[1523.30 --> 1524.16]  This is cool though.
[1524.26 --> 1524.62]  Actually.
[1524.82 --> 1528.44]  I don't know how much we want to go into it.
[1528.50 --> 1528.90]  I don't know.
[1528.90 --> 1529.30]  A lot.
[1529.60 --> 1529.96]  Okay.
[1530.90 --> 1531.16]  Right.
[1531.22 --> 1532.12]  I mean, is there a downside?
[1532.46 --> 1536.66]  I, I'm wondering if they can issue like takedowns for it or anything, even talking about it.
[1536.66 --> 1539.48]  Like these guys, what, what issue takedown for the WAN show?
[1539.90 --> 1540.10]  Yeah.
[1540.22 --> 1542.38]  If battle state wants to take down the WAN show, you know what?
[1542.40 --> 1542.82]  That's fine.
[1542.86 --> 1544.02]  I'll go to, I'll go toe to toe.
[1544.34 --> 1545.68]  That, I got no problem with that.
[1545.68 --> 1545.96]  All right.
[1546.14 --> 1547.40]  What are they going to, what are they going to do?
[1547.44 --> 1548.82]  What kind of, what kind of authority?
[1548.82 --> 1549.52]  I just don't know how it works.
[1549.52 --> 1554.48]  Under what authority would some stupid fucking Russian entity take down our podcast?
[1554.74 --> 1555.66]  Like you got to be kidding me.
[1556.06 --> 1556.62]  In order for play.
[1556.68 --> 1556.98]  Yes.
[1557.02 --> 1557.72]  This is the interview.
[1557.82 --> 1558.06]  Okay.
[1558.12 --> 1558.30]  Okay.
[1558.30 --> 1558.54]  Okay.
[1558.54 --> 1559.20]  We found it.
[1559.26 --> 1559.58]  Hold on.
[1560.34 --> 1561.08]  This interview.
[1561.96 --> 1563.08]  There we go.
[1563.08 --> 1567.80]  So the post is in order for players to donate, you need to keep them in a state of discomfort.
[1568.54 --> 1571.48]  This is a very old, you can see Moscow 2015.
[1572.00 --> 1572.08]  Yeah.
[1572.10 --> 1579.06]  So 2015 is, if I remember correctly, technically when Tarkov started, but this is as they're,
[1579.12 --> 1582.08]  so they're pivoting off of like the mobile game.
[1582.18 --> 1585.24]  They used to make some game called contract wars, which is either like a mobile game or a
[1585.24 --> 1585.92]  browser game or something.
[1585.92 --> 1586.64]  I don't remember what.
[1586.82 --> 1588.98]  And then they pivoted into escape from Tarkov.
[1589.08 --> 1591.52]  And this is like, as that pivot is kind of happening.
[1592.06 --> 1593.00]  He talks about, yeah.
[1593.08 --> 1594.60]  Cheaters are always such a serious thing.
[1595.34 --> 1595.66]  Yeah.
[1596.38 --> 1596.92]  Come on.
[1596.98 --> 1597.88]  Get to your revelation.
[1601.76 --> 1602.64]  Both ways.
[1603.22 --> 1603.58]  Okay.
[1603.62 --> 1604.36]  I'll say it.
[1605.10 --> 1606.08]  Good Lord.
[1606.18 --> 1607.44]  For me, it was honestly a revelation.
[1607.62 --> 1609.84]  How you perceive it is of course your business.
[1610.78 --> 1612.26]  If there are a lot of cheaters.
[1615.68 --> 1616.36]  So what?
[1616.36 --> 1617.84]  People just assume.
[1618.58 --> 1620.52]  Cheaters make other players uncomfortable.
[1621.42 --> 1624.58]  So they just assume their advantage is that they had.
[1624.68 --> 1626.02]  The main rule is to donate.
[1626.14 --> 1628.24]  You need to keep the player in a state of discomfort.
[1628.64 --> 1629.88]  The main rule is to donate.
[1629.88 --> 1629.96]  Right.
[1632.50 --> 1636.76]  So like his, his point is if your players are uncomfortable, they're going to try to like
[1636.76 --> 1640.30]  get an edge, pay to get advantages, to get an edge, stuff like that.
[1640.30 --> 1640.80]  Oh my God.
[1642.24 --> 1642.82]  Not great.
[1642.90 --> 1645.30]  Again, I don't know the full context of that interview.
[1645.48 --> 1646.76]  The translation might be wrong.
[1646.94 --> 1649.02]  There's a lot of things that could be potentially wrong with that.
[1649.06 --> 1651.74]  I wouldn't take that as like a 100% thing.
[1652.14 --> 1653.02]  Be careful there.
[1653.46 --> 1653.72]  Yeah.
[1654.28 --> 1654.48]  Yeah.
[1654.48 --> 1655.50]  Don't fall for misinformation.
[1655.80 --> 1659.42]  So when a full plane chat is saying the translation is accurate, but like we, I don't, I don't
[1659.42 --> 1659.56]  know.
[1659.90 --> 1661.78]  We generally trust float plane pretty good.
[1661.86 --> 1662.40]  It's probably.
[1662.56 --> 1662.74]  Yeah.
[1662.74 --> 1664.44]  Float plane chats are usually pretty reliable.
[1664.44 --> 1668.18]  I mean, I wouldn't trust Twitch chat as far as I could throw them and they're literally
[1668.18 --> 1668.64]  digital.
[1668.78 --> 1669.98]  They have no weight whatsoever.
[1670.10 --> 1671.48]  I could throw them very far.
[1672.06 --> 1672.18]  Yeah.
[1672.20 --> 1673.18]  I could throw them very far.
[1673.24 --> 1676.98]  That is unless we have to account for wind resistance, but I'm going to assume this is
[1676.98 --> 1678.34]  a grade 11 physics final.
[1679.56 --> 1680.64]  So I don't have to.
[1680.64 --> 1685.28]  Assume the cow is spherical.
[1689.18 --> 1690.98]  It's a rigid body cow.
[1691.50 --> 1692.24]  It's dead.
[1692.64 --> 1695.56]  There are multiplayer host it yourself.
[1696.32 --> 1697.72]  Play with your friends.
[1698.14 --> 1702.10]  Things happening very, very actively right now for Tarkov.
[1702.74 --> 1708.26]  I have seldom seen this much dedication and action on a project.
[1708.26 --> 1712.08]  It's, it's moving very, very fast.
[1712.24 --> 1714.44]  There's some videos on YouTube of people playing it.
[1714.56 --> 1717.30]  All have no fury like gamers scorned.
[1717.38 --> 1717.78]  Oh yeah.
[1717.94 --> 1718.20]  Truly.
[1718.32 --> 1721.62]  And a bunch of extremely hardcore gamers scorned as well.
[1721.82 --> 1722.00]  Yeah.
[1722.00 --> 1725.02]  Um, cause the, the dedication to this is mad.
[1725.02 --> 1727.32]  I mean, obviously if they're going to sell $150.
[1727.58 --> 1727.76]  Okay.
[1727.94 --> 1735.08]  So the fact that the community is so outraged and so universally outraged over $150 version
[1735.08 --> 1737.84]  of the game means that let's do the math.
[1738.02 --> 1743.00]  A significant number of them bought it because nobody bought it.
[1743.00 --> 1747.06]  People have been like, yeah, whatever that silly $150 version of the game that nobody
[1747.06 --> 1747.38]  bought.
[1747.72 --> 1748.48]  Who cares?
[1749.04 --> 1753.96]  But no, this is a game that people are invested in.
[1754.06 --> 1754.38]  Yeah.
[1754.42 --> 1755.62]  And that's dangerous.
[1755.92 --> 1757.52]  And I don't even think honestly.
[1758.04 --> 1758.76]  For battle state.
[1758.82 --> 1759.14]  I don't care.
[1759.14 --> 1764.76]  If, if that edge of darkness edition thing was originally 250 bucks, I bet you like a ton
[1764.76 --> 1765.20]  of people.
[1765.48 --> 1765.70]  Yeah.
[1765.74 --> 1767.76]  People would have been upset, but they would have bought it.
[1767.84 --> 1768.46]  They would have bought it.
[1768.46 --> 1769.98]  I do think the truck would have been a line.
[1770.22 --> 1770.50]  Yes.
[1770.50 --> 1771.90]  I think the truck still would have been a line.
[1771.90 --> 1773.06]  The truck is a big line.
[1773.14 --> 1775.54]  The call in people to raid thing is a big line.
[1775.56 --> 1776.16]  That's ridiculous.
[1776.48 --> 1778.66]  And then going back on your word is a big line.
[1778.78 --> 1784.14]  Those, those three things is what is crushed this community, but the community defies.
[1784.22 --> 1785.26]  The community is not crushed.
[1785.36 --> 1790.44]  The community made their own Tarkov basically by having a bunch of single.
[1790.58 --> 1793.54]  So single player Tarkov SPT has been a thing for a long time.
[1793.68 --> 1793.94]  Yeah.
[1794.44 --> 1797.02]  But it was, you know, single, single player.
[1797.02 --> 1801.58]  There's a bunch of mods for it though, that you can make the game so much better than
[1801.58 --> 1802.68]  the multiplayer experience.
[1802.80 --> 1802.96]  Right.
[1803.02 --> 1804.46]  But it was just a single player experience.
[1804.84 --> 1807.52]  Now there's Fika, a multiplayer mod.
[1808.20 --> 1809.76]  And I've seen some videos.
[1809.88 --> 1813.56]  I have genuinely not touched this, but I've seen some videos of people playing and it looks
[1813.56 --> 1814.32]  smooth.
[1814.50 --> 1819.98]  And there isn't a lot of like, you know, uh, desync between the players that it looks like
[1819.98 --> 1821.36]  at least as good as live.
[1821.36 --> 1825.98]  As far as I can tell, watching other people's gameplay of the, you know, the synchronization
[1825.98 --> 1828.64]  of the two players or multiple other players playing in the game.
[1828.70 --> 1835.80]  And then some of the mods for single player Tarkov work with the multiplayer mod.
[1836.36 --> 1842.66]  So you can just make your own Tarkov that's better in all the ways, except for blackjack.
[1842.76 --> 1849.18]  There isn't a PvP, but the active PvP and Tarkov is so over riddled by cheaters that it's
[1849.18 --> 1853.64]  like, you just cut that, cut that limb off.
[1853.70 --> 1854.52]  You know, it's probably fine.
[1855.04 --> 1857.20]  Um, so that's, that's, that's pretty cool.
[1857.38 --> 1858.56]  In other gaming news.
[1858.68 --> 1858.98]  Yeah.
[1859.02 --> 1861.88]  We do have another actually very big topic.
[1862.06 --> 1862.28]  Yeah.
[1862.40 --> 1864.06]  I won bro versus bro.
[1864.44 --> 1864.78]  Okay.
[1864.88 --> 1865.30]  We can go there.
[1865.30 --> 1865.94]  That's a big top.
[1866.04 --> 1866.68]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1866.68 --> 1867.08]  We can't.
[1867.70 --> 1868.04]  I'm down.
[1868.86 --> 1871.76]  Or we can talk about how Helldivers now will not let you play.
[1871.76 --> 1871.78]  Yeah.
[1871.78 --> 1873.26]  They're getting a view bomb now, right?
[1873.40 --> 1873.68]  Yeah.
[1873.68 --> 1875.56]  I have not kept up with this at all.
[1875.56 --> 1880.28]  Other than that chat will not stop talking about Helldivers.
[1880.50 --> 1880.80]  Not going to lie.
[1880.84 --> 1882.66]  That's the main reason why I know about it.
[1883.10 --> 1884.60]  When did this even happen?
[1884.72 --> 1885.50]  It must've happened.
[1885.58 --> 1888.66]  Like, yeah, all the articles are from today.
[1888.66 --> 1890.68]  So this is like very, very new.
[1891.10 --> 1893.36]  Uh, pirate software is apparently popping off about it.
[1893.84 --> 1897.56]  Um, yeah, not good from, from my understanding.
[1897.78 --> 1903.52]  It has shown as a requirement on their steam page the whole time that you need a PSN, but it
[1903.52 --> 1905.16]  wasn't enforced the whole time.
[1905.50 --> 1909.66]  Oh, so do you, so to play on PC, you need a PlayStation network account now.
[1910.58 --> 1913.22]  I mean, it wasn't required before though.
[1913.68 --> 1914.26]  I see.
[1914.44 --> 1919.66]  So people have played this whole time and here's the spicy part.
[1919.74 --> 1924.90]  Cause at first I was like, that's really annoying, but I didn't fully, fully understand
[1924.90 --> 1925.20]  it.
[1925.36 --> 1928.58]  And then pirate software's tweet made me fully understand it.
[1928.86 --> 1930.72]  Uh, there are certain countries.
[1930.72 --> 1933.00]  So where did this go?
[1933.00 --> 1935.14]  Where PSN's just straight up not available?
[1935.42 --> 1936.06]  Something like that.
[1936.12 --> 1936.26]  Yeah.
[1936.48 --> 1936.68]  Yeah.
[1936.84 --> 1941.66]  Pirate software says for all those, here, I'll go to my, uh, all of those saying to just
[1941.66 --> 1943.08]  make a PSN account, bro.
[1943.16 --> 1947.20]  If you've been playing Helldivers 2 and do not live in one of these listed countries, you
[1947.20 --> 1948.68]  cannot make a PSN account.
[1949.04 --> 1953.14]  Choosing a country you do not live in is a violation of Sony's TOS and could lead to account
[1953.14 --> 1953.66]  termination.
[1953.72 --> 1958.16]  Then again, like what, what is the drawback of that account being terminated?
[1958.16 --> 1958.74]  Does it matter?
[1959.36 --> 1960.04]  Well, you can't play.
[1960.76 --> 1961.02]  Right.
[1961.08 --> 1964.92]  But then couldn't you just registered on a different PSN account?
[1965.14 --> 1966.92]  You tied your steam account.
[1968.86 --> 1971.00]  So you're effectively banned from the game.
[1971.28 --> 1971.48]  Yeah.
[1971.48 --> 1971.92]  That's bad.
[1972.28 --> 1972.52]  Yeah.
[1972.60 --> 1973.30]  That's super bad.
[1973.44 --> 1977.02]  So like there, there's going to be a bunch of people that this happens to.
[1977.16 --> 1979.84]  So this is just objectively not a good thing at that point.
[1980.00 --> 1981.58]  Cause there's people that were playing.
[1981.68 --> 1982.40]  No problem.
[1982.56 --> 1983.12]  Just fine.
[1983.20 --> 1984.20]  Probably loving the game.
[1984.26 --> 1984.96]  Cause it's a great game.
[1985.12 --> 1985.70]  Roll a patch.
[1986.00 --> 1986.78]  They roll a patch.
[1986.78 --> 1987.98]  And now they can't.
[1988.04 --> 1988.20]  Yeah.
[1988.80 --> 1994.14]  And you shouldn't just like suddenly require a new account sign up once the game's been
[1994.14 --> 1994.78]  out for like months.
[1994.78 --> 1996.54]  Well, they didn't suddenly require it.
[1996.54 --> 1998.28]  They suddenly enforced it.
[1998.28 --> 1998.90]  Suddenly enforce it.
[1998.98 --> 1999.12]  Yeah.
[1999.18 --> 1999.32]  Yeah.
[1999.32 --> 1999.46]  Yeah.
[1999.46 --> 1999.78]  Fair enough.
[1999.80 --> 2003.14]  And it is up to you whether to enforce your rules or not.
[2003.22 --> 2006.74]  However, that's a pretty, that's a pretty crappy rule.
[2006.74 --> 2014.00]  It seems unnecessary given that obviously they didn't have it before and it clearly wasn't
[2014.00 --> 2014.66]  necessary.
[2015.06 --> 2015.16]  Yeah.
[2016.16 --> 2020.56]  I mean, this is, that's obviously part of their agreement with Sony, I guess, so that
[2020.56 --> 2021.84]  they can farm your data.
[2021.84 --> 2027.18]  Um, I believe it's a Sony published game or something.
[2027.18 --> 2027.24]  Yeah.
[2027.24 --> 2027.90]  That's tough.
[2027.96 --> 2028.36]  Something.
[2028.56 --> 2029.14]  I'm not a hundred percent.
[2029.14 --> 2034.94]  I mean, it does seem like, like an easy solution to this would be to, oh man, what is the easy
[2034.94 --> 2035.28]  solution?
[2035.28 --> 2039.20]  Cause there's no way Sony's going to just like suddenly allow you to register from a different
[2039.20 --> 2039.72]  country.
[2041.44 --> 2043.18]  How on earth are they going to fix this?
[2043.22 --> 2043.88]  I have no idea.
[2044.40 --> 2047.08]  Because there's no way Sony's going to let them out of that requirement.
[2047.24 --> 2048.42]  I don't think they're going to roll it back.
[2048.66 --> 2051.84]  They obviously would have known that this was going to generate a bunch of backlash.
[2052.30 --> 2052.48]  Yeah.
[2052.96 --> 2056.46]  Maybe they didn't, maybe they underestimated how angry gamers can be.
[2056.58 --> 2061.98]  I bet you, honestly, even they didn't consider this angle that Pirate Software pointed out
[2061.98 --> 2066.66]  because the, the initial one is kind of annoying and I could understand, honestly, some people
[2066.66 --> 2069.26]  boycotting it because like, oh, you make me get this new account.
[2069.30 --> 2069.90]  How dare you?
[2070.02 --> 2071.70]  I don't personally care that much.
[2071.76 --> 2071.90]  Yeah.
[2071.90 --> 2073.50]  But the second you're going to block out people.
[2073.50 --> 2076.44]  I mean, there's people that will be like mad that you're doing a giveaway because you
[2076.44 --> 2079.44]  have to have a Twitter account and they're like, oh, well, I don't have one.
[2079.48 --> 2081.24]  It's like, bro, Twitter's free.
[2081.46 --> 2082.92]  Well, I want them to have my information.
[2083.50 --> 2085.16]  Bro, make a Proton Mail account.
[2085.52 --> 2086.24]  Who gives a shit?
[2086.32 --> 2087.64]  Just put in some fake information.
[2087.82 --> 2089.92]  But, but it's like, it's on principle for these people.
[2089.92 --> 2090.14]  Right.
[2090.18 --> 2094.36]  So I could see someone just like on principle refusing to create a Sony account.
[2094.46 --> 2095.14]  Like I get it.
[2096.28 --> 2100.78]  But this is much worse.
[2100.78 --> 2102.78]  This is much, much worse.
[2103.02 --> 2108.46]  The second, the second it comes down to our, our, our, you know, our fellow democracy spreaders
[2108.46 --> 2110.60]  potentially no longer being able to play the game.
[2110.70 --> 2113.06]  That's, that's where a line has been crossed for me.
[2113.12 --> 2115.44]  Apparently you have to tie your phone number to Twitter now.
[2115.58 --> 2116.26]  Good Lord.
[2116.32 --> 2117.72]  What a crappy platform.
[2118.32 --> 2119.74]  You can probably put a fake one in.
[2120.32 --> 2120.94]  Um, no.
[2121.00 --> 2122.64]  Cause you probably, they probably send you a text.
[2122.96 --> 2123.58]  Oh, you think so?
[2123.68 --> 2124.30]  Yeah, probably.
[2125.64 --> 2126.80]  That's stupid.
[2126.80 --> 2129.76]  I used to put the White House for my address for like almost everything.
[2130.44 --> 2130.80]  Nice.
[2131.26 --> 2132.72]  Just worked all the time.
[2133.70 --> 2138.02]  I almost always use 90210 as a zip code whenever I register for anything American.
[2138.34 --> 2138.90]  There you go.
[2139.02 --> 2139.58]  Yeah, exactly.
[2140.00 --> 2142.58]  And it's like, you have to put in an address and I'm like, well, I'm Canadian.
[2142.68 --> 2143.92]  There's no dropdown for Canada.
[2144.04 --> 2144.78]  It only allows US.
[2144.94 --> 2146.36]  Well, I guess I live at the White House now.
[2147.34 --> 2151.32]  There's, there is probably junk mail addressed to me that has shown up to the White House.
[2151.32 --> 2153.34]  I thought about that not that long ago.
[2157.78 --> 2160.08]  Who the fuck is this Luke Lafreniere?
[2161.38 --> 2163.72]  That would actually be kind of hilarious prank.
[2164.22 --> 2167.58]  Signing the White House up for like magazine subscriptions and stuff.
[2168.56 --> 2170.10]  I just thought you guys might want this.
[2171.02 --> 2171.64]  You gotta know, right?
[2173.42 --> 2179.22]  I'm just trying to imagine like what would be some, what would be some fun subscriptions,
[2179.22 --> 2179.68]  you know?
[2179.76 --> 2183.26]  You gotta know this happens so much that it's probably like dull at this point.
[2183.26 --> 2186.12]  Apparently it goes to an offsite facility for processing for security reasons.
[2186.24 --> 2187.46]  That makes a ton of sense.
[2187.68 --> 2192.24]  But yeah, I, we were, oh, apparently I missed Ludwig in the YouTube chat.
[2192.50 --> 2193.36]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[2193.78 --> 2194.16]  Oh, wait.
[2194.42 --> 2195.54]  No one cares, Linus.
[2195.62 --> 2196.62]  Stop something.
[2196.82 --> 2197.18]  All right.
[2197.22 --> 2198.16]  Hey, thanks Ludwig.
[2198.24 --> 2199.18]  Thanks for showing up.
[2199.54 --> 2202.00]  Oh, this must have been because I was talking about bro versus bro.
[2202.12 --> 2202.42]  Nice.
[2202.72 --> 2203.06]  Okay.
[2203.10 --> 2204.24]  Well, should we just do that now?
[2204.46 --> 2204.76]  Nice.
[2204.84 --> 2205.06]  Yeah.
[2205.16 --> 2205.40]  Yeah.
[2205.40 --> 2206.60]  So that was fun.
[2206.60 --> 2210.62]  I went down to LA for a number of events.
[2210.88 --> 2215.18]  Now that it's, now that it's over, I don't have any sort of security concerns about it.
[2215.22 --> 2218.68]  So I, I attended the retirement party for MatPat.
[2219.22 --> 2222.04]  He is, is no longer working at Game Theorist.
[2222.12 --> 2224.38]  That doesn't mean he's no longer going to work at all.
[2224.46 --> 2226.18]  He seemed to be in very good spirits.
[2226.44 --> 2230.74]  I don't know him especially well or anything like that, but we've talked a couple of times.
[2230.74 --> 2234.88]  Obviously I have a ton of respect for his work and he seems like one of those people that
[2234.88 --> 2241.88]  you meet in person and you're like, all right, well, you know, don't take this the wrong way,
[2241.98 --> 2246.52]  but I think I had the full experience of meeting you and getting your deal from watching your
[2246.52 --> 2246.92]  videos.
[2247.98 --> 2253.40]  And to be clear, obviously, you know, he'll say things off camera that he wouldn't say
[2253.40 --> 2254.04]  on camera.
[2254.04 --> 2258.32]  But if you watch MatPat's videos and you're like, wow, he seems like a likable dude, then
[2258.32 --> 2261.70]  I think you'll meet him in person and think, wow, he seems like a likable dude.
[2262.00 --> 2263.72]  Very, very genuine guy.
[2263.86 --> 2265.92]  He and Steph, absolutely fantastic.
[2266.14 --> 2267.40]  I've done a ton for the platform.
[2267.56 --> 2268.88]  I've done a ton for the community.
[2269.34 --> 2272.96]  So I was very honored to, to be able to be down there for that.
[2273.60 --> 2279.54]  And then since I was heading down, that was actually the thing that instigated my trip.
[2279.54 --> 2285.16]  I was like, holy shnikes, I've been supposed to do a bro versus bro with Ludwig forever.
[2285.44 --> 2285.56]  Yeah.
[2285.66 --> 2288.06]  He came up here and did that collab with us.
[2288.06 --> 2291.10]  And I told him at the time, I was like, I owe you one.
[2291.18 --> 2291.84]  Thank you very much.
[2291.88 --> 2293.36]  That was absolutely fantastic.
[2294.20 --> 2295.22]  Anytime, by the way.
[2295.28 --> 2296.42]  And he's like, by the way, I'm in LA.
[2296.54 --> 2297.78]  And I was like, heck yeah.
[2298.06 --> 2298.26]  Yeah.
[2298.36 --> 2298.54]  Yeah.
[2300.64 --> 2301.16]  Heck yeah.
[2301.22 --> 2301.42]  Right.
[2301.52 --> 2302.56]  So I'm okay.
[2302.56 --> 2303.38]  I'm coming down to LA.
[2303.46 --> 2304.22]  Can we make this work?
[2304.28 --> 2305.80]  Can we try and put these two things together?
[2305.80 --> 2307.48]  And then stars aligned.
[2307.48 --> 2310.04]  And I ended up doing one more thing while I was down there.
[2310.12 --> 2317.76]  So on the Tuesday, I shot a video in collaboration with HP Enterprise and Kioxia.
[2318.06 --> 2319.02]  Do you know about this?
[2319.42 --> 2321.36]  I know some amount about it.
[2321.38 --> 2323.68]  On the Spaceborne 2 computer.
[2325.46 --> 2325.78]  Oh.
[2326.14 --> 2327.14]  So they rented.
[2327.38 --> 2328.42]  And I kid you not.
[2328.50 --> 2331.08]  This is apparently, don't quote me on this because who knows.
[2331.08 --> 2336.00]  Sometimes people just like, they talk shit and like, you know, they talk a big game,
[2336.10 --> 2337.08]  but it's actually whatever.
[2337.08 --> 2344.22]  But apparently the set that they rented was at least a piece of the same one that they
[2344.22 --> 2348.44]  used on Big Bang Theory when Wolowitz goes to the ISS.
[2349.14 --> 2352.48]  So I'm in this like ISS looking set.
[2352.62 --> 2359.14]  And then they have a couple of the actual machines that were just sent up to the ISS.
[2359.14 --> 2361.90]  And I think it was February of this year.
[2361.90 --> 2368.30]  And we talk about all the things about them that are custom for space.
[2368.54 --> 2372.62]  All the things about them that are not space hardened in any way whatsoever.
[2373.26 --> 2375.38]  Some of the experiments that they've done over the years.
[2375.50 --> 2380.72]  Some of the benefits of having this processing on board on the International Space Station versus
[2380.72 --> 2381.96]  having the processing done.
[2381.96 --> 2385.94]  I mean, yeah, I guess they can have cloud computing from up there.
[2386.00 --> 2387.76]  They just beam it down instead of up, right?
[2389.10 --> 2389.54]  Versus.
[2389.94 --> 2390.98]  Reverse cloud computing.
[2391.26 --> 2393.08]  Versus having processing done in the cloud.
[2393.08 --> 2395.00]  So that's going to be a super cool video.
[2395.10 --> 2396.10]  So we shot that on the Tuesday.
[2396.26 --> 2398.30]  And then I came back up Tuesday night.
[2398.42 --> 2399.64]  But the highlight of the trip.
[2399.80 --> 2404.84]  The absolute highlight of the trip for me was participating in Bro vs. Bro.
[2405.24 --> 2407.28]  What's really funny about this is I don't...
[2407.28 --> 2408.86]  Just one, before you get into the Bro vs. Bro.
[2408.90 --> 2409.06]  Yeah.
[2409.14 --> 2411.28]  I was going to show you, but there's not really much there.
[2411.28 --> 2418.28]  But the reason why I knew that that happened was because my friend person from NASA...
[2419.42 --> 2419.56]  Oh, yeah.
[2419.64 --> 2420.62]  ...that got me to go down there.
[2420.68 --> 2422.48]  And then now I just, like, play games with them for fun.
[2422.64 --> 2425.92]  He sent me a message and was like, uh, how'd you guys do this?
[2426.34 --> 2428.44]  It was a screenshot of the, like, ASCII art.
[2428.90 --> 2429.62]  It was like, what?
[2430.78 --> 2431.14]  Okay.
[2431.40 --> 2433.08]  And I was like, hold on, what is this?
[2433.16 --> 2435.92]  We're not going to spoil what we beamed to the ISS.
[2436.14 --> 2436.88]  Okay, okay, okay.
[2437.04 --> 2437.72]  But we did.
[2437.72 --> 2439.72]  We did get...
[2439.72 --> 2442.16]  We got certain access.
[2442.76 --> 2446.56]  And we definitely beamed a message to the International Space Station.
[2448.02 --> 2453.98]  Also, they're still interested in potentially doing a video on Mission Control Center design and stuff like that.
[2454.06 --> 2454.76]  I think it would be really good.
[2455.42 --> 2460.42]  So anyway, what's really funny about Bro vs. Bro with Ludwig was that having...
[2460.42 --> 2462.00]  I don't watch a lot of YouTube.
[2462.36 --> 2465.32]  And I've been very open about this in the past.
[2465.32 --> 2468.52]  I'm not trying to be, like, an asshole or anything like that.
[2468.54 --> 2469.18]  You, like, not know what it was?
[2469.20 --> 2469.98]  It's just the truth.
[2470.22 --> 2475.44]  Well, don't you remember on WAN Show when I essentially pitched a gaming challenge with him after he said,
[2475.62 --> 2477.42]  I will beat Linus at literally any game.
[2478.14 --> 2481.58]  And I pitched a gaming challenge that was essentially Bro vs. Bro?
[2481.68 --> 2482.58]  Yeah, I think I remember that.
[2482.64 --> 2482.88]  Yeah.
[2483.02 --> 2484.60]  I had no idea at the time.
[2484.72 --> 2486.10]  I wasn't doing a bit.
[2487.04 --> 2488.22]  I didn't know it existed.
[2488.22 --> 2489.76]  I believe you because I know you don't watch YouTube.
[2489.88 --> 2491.14]  You just read the comments.
[2491.14 --> 2491.62]  Exactly.
[2491.94 --> 2500.30]  So Bro vs. Bro is his format where each of the two competitors brings some advantage games into the game pool.
[2500.56 --> 2500.72]  Yeah.
[2500.78 --> 2504.08]  And then there are also some neutral games in the game pool.
[2504.44 --> 2512.66]  So the neutral games are Battleship, Tetris, for this one anyway, Pong, and Rock, Paper, Scissors.
[2513.02 --> 2513.18]  Yeah.
[2513.20 --> 2515.38]  And then we each brought our own advantage games.
[2515.48 --> 2516.82]  He brought Bireo Cart.
[2516.82 --> 2519.28]  Oh, shoot.
[2519.38 --> 2520.94]  What were his other advantage games?
[2521.00 --> 2522.04]  I remember that one well.
[2522.26 --> 2523.26]  Was GeoGuessr one of his?
[2523.28 --> 2524.56]  GeoGuessr was one of them.
[2524.76 --> 2524.94]  Yep.
[2525.28 --> 2527.54]  And then he also brought Tekken.
[2527.62 --> 2528.18]  Tekken 8.
[2528.32 --> 2528.88]  Oh, okay.
[2528.92 --> 2529.32]  I didn't see that.
[2529.36 --> 2537.72]  And then my advantage games were Towerfall, Beat Saber, and Drunken Fight Simulator,
[2537.72 --> 2539.72]  which, if you remember...
[2539.72 --> 2542.92]  You didn't pick Halo?
[2543.28 --> 2547.44]  If you remember, is a game that you and I played...
[2547.44 --> 2548.12]  Yeah, I remember.
[2548.30 --> 2551.52]  ...one time, four years ago...
[2551.52 --> 2552.70]  Why would you pick that?
[2552.94 --> 2557.54]  ...when we had a gaming night where we decided we were going to play something fresh...
[2557.54 --> 2558.94]  This was very fun, actually.
[2559.06 --> 2563.90]  ...and we sorted the entire Steam store by price low to high,
[2563.90 --> 2567.10]  and just started buying the cheapest games.
[2567.30 --> 2567.64]  Barrow?
[2568.04 --> 2568.78]  Yeah, Barrow.
[2568.88 --> 2569.62]  Barrow 2020.
[2570.04 --> 2570.32]  Let's go.
[2570.32 --> 2570.58]  Barrow was sick.
[2570.84 --> 2571.52]  Drunken Fight Simulator was sick.
[2571.52 --> 2573.82]  We played some Disc Jam.
[2574.06 --> 2575.42]  That was actually pretty fun.
[2575.50 --> 2577.54]  Legitimately fun before the servers got all shut down.
[2577.62 --> 2578.30]  Don't buy it now.
[2578.50 --> 2579.18]  Waste of money now.
[2579.26 --> 2579.74]  The servers don't work.
[2579.74 --> 2584.50]  If you want a fun game to buy now that is kind of in this realm of silly, entertaining games,
[2584.80 --> 2585.38]  tape to tape.
[2585.58 --> 2586.34]  Yeah, we're having a blast with that.
[2586.52 --> 2588.16]  Genuinely, actually very fun.
[2588.88 --> 2590.06]  And pretty well made.
[2590.30 --> 2590.84]  So check it out.
[2590.84 --> 2595.28]  So anyway, so I brought Drunken Fight Simulator to the fight.
[2595.78 --> 2596.04]  Beautiful.
[2596.58 --> 2598.72]  So that's our pool of 10 games.
[2599.00 --> 2603.56]  And the way the format works is you kick off with a rock, paper, scissors, which he didn't show.
[2603.76 --> 2609.46]  Which is a shame, actually, because it was part of the reason why I led the way that I did
[2609.46 --> 2611.48]  in the rock, paper, scissors.
[2611.48 --> 2612.32]  The final rock, paper, scissors.
[2612.42 --> 2615.00]  In the rock, paper, scissors that ended up deciding it.
[2615.26 --> 2618.22]  Was because I figured he wouldn't expect me to do the same thing again.
[2618.22 --> 2621.68]  But he was actually playing a completely different mind game with me.
[2621.88 --> 2623.94]  Now, I have to admit something.
[2624.04 --> 2633.24]  Ludwig, if you're watching this, one of the best gamers I know, even if she's not too good
[2633.24 --> 2637.80]  with a controller or a keyboard and mouse, and she hasn't played a lot of video games,
[2638.06 --> 2639.00]  is my wife.
[2639.00 --> 2646.94]  And one of the things that she does is she will be constantly, even when she is very clearly
[2646.94 --> 2651.88]  in a dominant position on the board, constantly talking about how she doesn't really know what
[2651.88 --> 2654.38]  she's doing, and she's just kind of doing stuff.
[2654.60 --> 2657.14]  Have you ever played a strategy game with that woman?
[2658.38 --> 2659.94]  I don't think so.
[2659.94 --> 2667.34]  I vowed 15 years ago, at some point during a family game night, that I would never play
[2667.34 --> 2668.36]  Risk with her again.
[2669.42 --> 2669.82]  Never.
[2670.36 --> 2672.94]  Because, because she has, like, you know me.
[2673.24 --> 2674.70]  I'm pretty intense.
[2674.84 --> 2675.00]  Yeah.
[2675.20 --> 2676.90]  And I'll be like, I'll be like...
[2676.90 --> 2679.32]  I have to warn people before we play video games with you.
[2679.48 --> 2679.68]  Yeah.
[2680.52 --> 2683.32]  I'll like start, I'll start to call shots on the board.
[2683.32 --> 2691.34]  I'll be like, okay, so everyone can see right now that player A is in a position where,
[2691.56 --> 2697.24]  look, I can't do anything about any of this because I'm stuck in bloody South America where
[2697.24 --> 2702.82]  you people exiled me, but they are about to take over Asia, and their borders are completely
[2702.82 --> 2708.28]  ready to be fortified, and if you or you don't do anything, this game is over.
[2708.98 --> 2710.28]  Like, I'm very like that.
[2710.28 --> 2713.06]  He's good at inciting action from others.
[2713.06 --> 2716.94]  Well, no, I'm not, because nobody likes that guy.
[2717.34 --> 2717.52]  Oh.
[2717.74 --> 2722.88]  So, so Yvonne will be just like, she'll apologize when she attacks people and stuff.
[2722.98 --> 2723.00]  Oh.
[2723.56 --> 2725.26]  So she'll be the nice person.
[2725.56 --> 2726.00]  Gotcha.
[2726.20 --> 2729.58]  That doesn't say anything other than, yeah, sorry, I'm not really, I'm not really sure
[2729.58 --> 2730.10]  how to play this game.
[2730.10 --> 2730.78]  I don't really know what I'm doing.
[2730.88 --> 2732.74]  Sorry, I took over all your places.
[2732.86 --> 2740.88]  So I have to admit, Ludwig, during the rock, paper, scissors match, I was, I was taking
[2740.88 --> 2743.04]  a page out of my wife's book a little bit.
[2743.12 --> 2743.56]  Got it.
[2743.70 --> 2745.66]  Like I, and to be clear, to be clear.
[2745.72 --> 2746.78]  So you had a strategy.
[2746.92 --> 2748.72]  What I said, what I said was true.
[2749.04 --> 2751.32]  I don't know rock, paper, scissors meta.
[2751.76 --> 2752.84]  Like I don't, I don't know.
[2752.94 --> 2754.04]  I was looking it up.
[2754.10 --> 2755.20]  I was looking it up later.
[2755.20 --> 2760.62]  And apparently, statistically, scissors is the least common throw, for example.
[2761.24 --> 2763.86]  Men have a tendency to throw rock first.
[2764.00 --> 2768.74]  And there's like, man, there's all these f***ing like mind games and stuff.
[2768.94 --> 2774.66]  So when he's, when he's telling me things like, you sick f***, who throws that there?
[2774.74 --> 2781.64]  Like, I legitimately didn't, I didn't know why that was a weird thing to do or whatever.
[2781.64 --> 2782.08]  Yeah.
[2782.28 --> 2785.28]  But what I was definitely trying to do was I was.
[2785.38 --> 2786.40]  I'm a bit of a rock thrower myself.
[2786.52 --> 2787.88]  Was I was trying to get in his head.
[2788.12 --> 2788.34]  Yeah.
[2788.46 --> 2792.00]  Is I was, I was, I wasn't trying to figure out what he would do.
[2793.58 --> 2795.66]  That was how I lost the first two.
[2795.76 --> 2797.66]  You're trying to figure out what he thought you would do?
[2797.78 --> 2798.02]  Yes.
[2798.10 --> 2798.66]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2798.70 --> 2800.18]  That's what I was trying to figure out.
[2800.28 --> 2801.52]  What does he think?
[2801.86 --> 2806.24]  Because, because I, I don't know, I've only hung out with him a couple times now and both
[2806.24 --> 2807.00]  times professionally.
[2807.00 --> 2809.04]  Like we don't know each other super well or anything.
[2809.26 --> 2809.40]  Yeah.
[2809.40 --> 2815.02]  So his entire experience with me is both relatively recent and relatively short.
[2815.70 --> 2822.24]  So all I had to do was think about absolutely everything he knows about me and try and figure
[2822.24 --> 2826.48]  out what he thought I would do and then try and get one ahead of it.
[2827.74 --> 2832.68]  And so ultimate, ultimately, you know, spoiler alert, but it's definitely still worth watching.
[2833.12 --> 2833.32]  Yeah.
[2833.32 --> 2836.98]  Um, man, I don't know how you were confident.
[2837.08 --> 2839.62]  He messages me right after and he's like, never lost hope.
[2839.74 --> 2840.52]  Never lost hope.
[2840.68 --> 2846.54]  How could you not have lost hope when we were 4-4 in our final game and then rock, paper,
[2846.62 --> 2847.70]  scissors was best of five.
[2847.78 --> 2848.82]  I was down 2-0.
[2849.40 --> 2852.02]  How could you possibly not have lost hope at that point?
[2852.02 --> 2852.90]  Rock, paper, scissors is like that.
[2852.98 --> 2855.18]  Rock, paper, scissors is a super swingy game.
[2856.34 --> 2857.24]  Yeah, I guess.
[2857.24 --> 2861.94]  Because people will like, if you like fall on your back foot in rock, paper, scissors, you'll
[2861.94 --> 2864.52]  just like chain bad ideas.
[2864.82 --> 2866.20]  But that didn't even happen.
[2866.66 --> 2867.18]  I counted.
[2867.30 --> 2872.18]  It took us, I think it was either 12 or 13 to have five winners.
[2872.18 --> 2872.44]  Yeah.
[2873.34 --> 2876.82]  I don't know if that is normal, but it doesn't, it didn't feel normal.
[2876.98 --> 2878.00]  I think it's pretty normal.
[2878.12 --> 2878.74]  It felt kind of insane.
[2878.74 --> 2882.84]  There's a huge amount of rock, paper, scissors games that I've been involved in.
[2883.82 --> 2888.08]  I'm making this sound like I do this often, which is not true, just to be clear.
[2888.20 --> 2891.48]  But like, people will throw the same thing all the time.
[2892.16 --> 2892.78]  Super common.
[2892.94 --> 2893.26]  Okay.
[2893.40 --> 2893.76]  All right.
[2893.80 --> 2894.02]  Yeah.
[2894.36 --> 2897.24]  And, and, and that's the other thing that I said that was true, by the way, Ludwig,
[2897.24 --> 2901.82]  I actually don't, I don't really play, which he's not going to be happier hearing me say
[2901.82 --> 2902.28]  right now.
[2902.28 --> 2906.98]  Cause he got like, he seemed, he seemed a little upset about me beating him at things
[2906.98 --> 2908.04]  and being like, I don't play this.
[2908.04 --> 2908.98]  You don't play that many games.
[2909.08 --> 2909.30]  Yeah.
[2909.86 --> 2910.90]  I mean, it is true.
[2911.20 --> 2913.08]  When I was used to play a lot.
[2913.16 --> 2916.10]  When I was going through trying to find my advantage games though, man.
[2916.34 --> 2917.10]  Why didn't you pick Halo?
[2917.26 --> 2918.90]  Why don't you play Supreme Commander?
[2919.38 --> 2919.70]  Okay.
[2919.70 --> 2919.98]  Okay.
[2920.02 --> 2920.18]  Okay.
[2920.22 --> 2921.40]  Well, there were a couple of factors.
[2921.48 --> 2922.56]  Remember, I'm an entertainer.
[2923.14 --> 2923.32]  Yeah.
[2923.40 --> 2924.64]  I'm not going to pick Supreme Commander.
[2924.86 --> 2924.96]  Yeah.
[2924.96 --> 2926.08]  Subcom would not have been fun.
[2926.08 --> 2926.26]  Yeah.
[2926.26 --> 2928.76]  That's not, that's not engaging for the audience.
[2928.76 --> 2931.38]  Just like watching someone not know how to play an RTS.
[2931.64 --> 2932.72]  And like, it's not entertaining.
[2932.72 --> 2933.82]  The most complicated RTS.
[2934.08 --> 2934.48]  Yeah.
[2935.28 --> 2936.32]  It's, it's, it's not.
[2936.44 --> 2936.78]  It's up there.
[2937.42 --> 2942.26]  It's, I wouldn't say it's the most complicated necessarily, but it's definitely kind of arcane.
[2942.48 --> 2947.52]  Like the way that it works is fundamentally different from the normal way that an RTS works.
[2947.64 --> 2947.78]  Okay.
[2947.78 --> 2948.42]  That's a better way.
[2948.52 --> 2951.38]  You mine materials and then you use them to make something.
[2951.38 --> 2958.30]  In Supreme Commander, you have a continuous economy of income and, uh, and use and you
[2958.30 --> 2959.46]  have to balance them.
[2959.56 --> 2959.76]  Yeah.
[2959.90 --> 2961.04]  So it's just, it's a little.
[2961.28 --> 2961.74]  It's weird.
[2962.12 --> 2963.56]  Different to wrap your brain around.
[2964.02 --> 2966.30]  Um, so that would not have been entertaining at all.
[2966.38 --> 2970.48]  He would have had like two things and I would have stormed in with an army and just blown
[2970.48 --> 2971.20]  it all up.
[2971.20 --> 2974.16]  Um, as for why not, you tried to push for content a little bit.
[2974.20 --> 2976.64]  As for why not Halo, they had only one computer there.
[2976.70 --> 2977.94]  We weren't in their main studio.
[2978.36 --> 2983.30]  We were, cause I was realistically, I think what he really wanted was to have me down there
[2983.30 --> 2984.80]  for the yard, their podcast.
[2985.02 --> 2989.40]  And then, well, I mean, what, we're going to like go do that in that studio and then
[2989.40 --> 2992.68]  go do like bro versus bro in a different studio.
[2992.76 --> 2993.54]  Like it doesn't make sense.
[2993.54 --> 2993.76]  Right.
[2993.92 --> 2998.10]  So we, I, we kind of had to throw together what we had with what we had.
[2998.22 --> 2998.32]  Sure.
[2998.32 --> 3002.44]  So if you watch the archive of the live stream, which I think is unlisted now, I don't know
[3002.44 --> 3007.96]  if he links it anywhere, but it's like much longer and has a lot of technical difficulties
[3007.96 --> 3008.88]  and stuff like that.
[3008.98 --> 3009.42]  It's funny.
[3009.52 --> 3013.42]  The number of comments that I see, like what's with all the technical difficulties, as long
[3013.42 --> 3016.72]  as even technical, like, like people like actually mad about it.
[3016.74 --> 3017.60]  I'm like, I'm a guest.
[3017.68 --> 3017.82]  What?
[3017.86 --> 3021.02]  I'm going to like, I'm going to diagnose their capture card.
[3021.02 --> 3024.18]  No, I'm going to sit and patiently interact with chat.
[3024.34 --> 3026.90]  And come on, you guys, what do you think this is?
[3027.08 --> 3027.80]  There's also like.
[3027.80 --> 3032.12]  Do you go into someone's house for dinner and like start cooking the meal for them?
[3032.18 --> 3033.54]  Like, I don't care if you're a chef.
[3033.60 --> 3034.50]  That's fucking rude.
[3034.86 --> 3036.00]  Like, what's your problem?
[3037.88 --> 3038.32]  Jeez.
[3038.58 --> 3040.88]  It's also, I mean, we have technical difficulties all the time.
[3041.16 --> 3041.86]  Yeah, exactly.
[3042.00 --> 3042.84]  Stuff can happen.
[3042.84 --> 3047.84]  Like if you've ever done anything in your life, you know that things don't necessarily
[3047.84 --> 3049.64]  always work the way they're supposed to.
[3050.02 --> 3050.14]  Yeah.
[3050.22 --> 3053.90]  It's like, man, that's some A plus backseat driving right there.
[3053.90 --> 3055.68]  Um, so anyway.
[3055.74 --> 3057.10]  Oh, how do you miss Abbotsford?
[3058.70 --> 3060.70]  You know, what's funny is I even, okay.
[3060.86 --> 3065.06]  You know, those doors that all the new houses have been installing with like the windows
[3065.06 --> 3070.46]  like this down the, I saw one and I was like, I have no idea how common they are.
[3070.46 --> 3075.12]  For all I know, they're super trendy just in general, more broadly.
[3075.38 --> 3079.12]  But I saw it and I was like, man, that looks exactly like those doors that like my neighbor
[3079.12 --> 3081.88]  just installed and every new housing development locally has.
[3082.72 --> 3084.76]  I wanted so badly.
[3084.86 --> 3086.22]  So this is GeoGuessr Canada.
[3086.40 --> 3088.08]  He challenged me to GeoGuessr Canada.
[3088.22 --> 3089.28]  I was on my home turf.
[3089.46 --> 3093.82]  Which is, you know, if you're pushing for content, which I think you both do, which is good.
[3093.82 --> 3097.76]  That's one way to take an advantaged game for him and make it more interesting.
[3097.76 --> 3099.10]  Because I've never played GeoGuessr.
[3099.24 --> 3099.44]  Yeah.
[3099.54 --> 3101.78]  I've literally never played GeoGuessr.
[3101.80 --> 3106.32]  But as someone who has not a lot, but a buddy of mine and I will play every once in a while.
[3106.40 --> 3106.84]  Hi, Bobby.
[3107.54 --> 3109.32]  But a buddy and I will play.
[3109.46 --> 3111.26]  And Canada actually very rarely comes up.
[3111.80 --> 3115.10]  So even if he plays a lot, he probably doesn't see a ton of Canada.
[3115.82 --> 3117.30]  So it's like, yeah, this is cool mix.
[3118.02 --> 3123.52]  Anyway, a location came up that was probably about 30 to 50 miles from home for me.
[3123.82 --> 3129.68]  Like it was embarrassing that I guessed across the entire flipping country.
[3129.80 --> 3130.94]  And it cost me the game.
[3131.04 --> 3131.20]  Yeah.
[3131.42 --> 3134.10]  And almost cost me the whole challenge.
[3134.10 --> 3136.50]  Because if I'd won that game, it would have been over.
[3136.50 --> 3142.34]  I wouldn't have had to go to being down 2-0 in a best of five rock, paper, scissors.
[3142.62 --> 3147.06]  Like how close that was to losing me the game was terrible.
[3147.30 --> 3151.58]  So basically what was going on in my head, this was the very first round of GeoGuessr.
[3151.94 --> 3153.20]  I've never played before.
[3153.20 --> 3156.90]  I didn't really understand how quickly you should be moving around and stuff.
[3157.14 --> 3158.20]  Yeah, I saw that.
[3158.28 --> 3160.06]  I hadn't really watched him play.
[3160.50 --> 3161.36]  Yeah, you want to zoom.
[3161.60 --> 3161.86]  Yeah.
[3162.00 --> 3163.84]  And so I was just there.
[3163.98 --> 3167.28]  I was like, oh, can I see anything that's a hint?
[3167.36 --> 3169.08]  No, all the license plates are kind of blurred.
[3169.20 --> 3171.02]  I guess I won't be able to rely on that.
[3171.22 --> 3173.20]  And do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[3173.20 --> 3178.78]  And it felt so close to home that I second-guessed myself.
[3179.20 --> 3181.44]  I went, there's no way.
[3181.52 --> 3183.18]  They gotta be more common than that.
[3183.18 --> 3186.18]  There's no way the first one is just going to be in my backyard.
[3187.02 --> 3187.90]  I don't know.
[3188.06 --> 3189.40]  Some suburb in Ontario.
[3189.40 --> 3193.10]  And I ended up being off by like 2,000 miles.
[3193.10 --> 3194.44]  Because Canada's enormous.
[3194.52 --> 3196.08]  Or whatever it is.
[3196.14 --> 3198.54]  My big crutch for GeoGuessr is domains.
[3199.78 --> 3200.30]  Domains?
[3200.54 --> 3203.02]  Because it's usually worldwide.
[3203.18 --> 3207.56]  And I find that the really big countries, like the US and Canada, really actually don't come up that much.
[3208.10 --> 3209.20]  It's often Europe.
[3209.88 --> 3210.78]  Various European countries.
[3210.78 --> 3212.16]  Oh, like little European countries.
[3212.16 --> 3214.92]  So even if you're off, you're going to be close-ish.
[3215.08 --> 3220.92]  But if you see a store banner, and the store banner has their website on it, it's in .nl.
[3221.12 --> 3221.68]  It's like, oh.
[3221.84 --> 3223.12]  Yeah, then that's a pretty easy one.
[3223.20 --> 3223.38]  Cool.
[3223.92 --> 3229.12]  So I'll just like zoom around, try to find something that would have a website on it, and they'd be like, all right, cool.
[3229.40 --> 3230.28]  I know where that is.
[3230.36 --> 3232.16]  And I figured some of that stuff out later.
[3232.80 --> 3233.04]  Yeah.
[3233.12 --> 3234.86]  Like using signs and stuff.
[3234.94 --> 3236.88]  But I didn't figure it out early on.
[3236.88 --> 3238.56]  It just wasn't a game I'd played before.
[3238.72 --> 3242.56]  It was brutal, too, because the end score, if I remember correctly, was actually very close.
[3242.58 --> 3243.62]  It was really close.
[3243.70 --> 3244.34]  Like really close.
[3244.34 --> 3245.00]  Less than 100 points.
[3245.08 --> 3246.52]  Out of 25,000.
[3246.72 --> 3252.12]  And he had one where like almost immediately on his screen, there was a sign that just said, what was it?
[3252.12 --> 3252.52]  Manitoba?
[3252.94 --> 3254.86]  Yeah, the name of a university or something.
[3255.00 --> 3255.18]  Yeah.
[3255.54 --> 3260.26]  And then like one or two more clicks later, and it was two major highways crossing each other.
[3260.28 --> 3261.10]  That was his last one.
[3261.12 --> 3265.58]  And it was like, oh, I guess I can find exactly this spot and just get like maximum.
[3265.58 --> 3265.82]  Yeah.
[3265.90 --> 3268.32]  So when I saw that happening, I was like, oh, I guess he lost.
[3268.74 --> 3270.16]  Because I thought you had it up until then.
[3270.16 --> 3272.18]  Because without basically a perfect guess.
[3272.42 --> 3272.66]  Yeah.
[3272.94 --> 3273.24]  I know.
[3273.24 --> 3274.18]  You were going to win anyways.
[3274.52 --> 3274.80]  Yeah.
[3275.06 --> 3275.28]  Yeah.
[3276.18 --> 3276.50]  Man.
[3276.88 --> 3277.20]  How?
[3277.40 --> 3281.68]  I mean, realistically, he had his own bamboozled moments.
[3281.68 --> 3289.60]  I still burst out laughing every time I watch his breakout gameplay.
[3290.14 --> 3291.40]  I didn't see the whole thing.
[3291.40 --> 3292.44]  You didn't see breakout?
[3292.56 --> 3293.64]  No, I saw parts of it.
[3293.64 --> 3293.66]  Okay.
[3293.66 --> 3296.80]  That's the one thing that we're going to watch together on the show today.
[3296.80 --> 3298.40]  I saw you playing.
[3298.68 --> 3300.70]  I saw you talking about the laggy input.
[3301.08 --> 3301.16]  Yes.
[3301.16 --> 3303.60]  And then I saw them try to show like it's not laggy.
[3303.66 --> 3305.60]  And I'm watching just being like, what do you mean?
[3305.84 --> 3308.54]  I can see it's laggy through the power of the internets.
[3308.70 --> 3310.80]  But I didn't get to watch the rest of it.
[3310.80 --> 3311.98]  I was like busy doing stuff.
[3312.02 --> 3313.28]  And I was just trying to tune in when I could.
[3313.42 --> 3313.58]  Yeah.
[3313.62 --> 3313.76]  Yeah.
[3313.76 --> 3314.34]  That's fine.
[3314.86 --> 3320.52]  This is, man, this is absolutely wild though.
[3320.96 --> 3321.24]  Okay.
[3321.30 --> 3324.56]  So here, I'm bringing it up on the stream version.
[3324.56 --> 3325.94]  Hey, Dan, am I going to have audio here?
[3327.46 --> 3327.78]  Yes.
[3328.12 --> 3329.70]  You are not playing anything now.
[3330.08 --> 3331.10]  I sure am not.
[3331.60 --> 3332.24]  Am I now?
[3332.60 --> 3332.88]  Yes.
[3333.10 --> 3333.32]  All right.
[3333.36 --> 3333.86]  Here, let's go.
[3334.00 --> 3334.78]  So Linus laptop.
[3334.92 --> 3335.20]  Here we go.
[3335.24 --> 3336.50]  Make sure that you guys can hear it too.
[3337.72 --> 3337.90]  Okay.
[3337.92 --> 3340.52]  So he's just, he's playing around with it a little bit to kind of get a feel for the
[3340.52 --> 3340.74]  lag.
[3340.78 --> 3340.80]  Yeah.
[3340.80 --> 3340.92]  Yeah.
[3340.92 --> 3341.06]  Yeah.
[3341.06 --> 3341.46]  That's smart.
[3342.28 --> 3343.18]  I think it's this one.
[3344.20 --> 3345.44]  Oh, he keeps like.
[3347.54 --> 3347.86]  Yeah.
[3348.80 --> 3350.30]  Oh, is the audio really bad?
[3350.32 --> 3350.86]  Only for us.
[3351.04 --> 3352.10]  Most likely only for us.
[3352.18 --> 3352.54]  Oh, okay.
[3352.58 --> 3352.68]  Cool.
[3354.56 --> 3355.04]  Oh God.
[3355.34 --> 3355.56]  Okay.
[3355.76 --> 3356.06]  I hope.
[3356.46 --> 3357.22]  But it should be.
[3357.92 --> 3359.28]  Why is it so bad for us?
[3359.98 --> 3361.30]  Sounds like sample rate mismatch.
[3361.50 --> 3361.78]  Okay.
[3362.30 --> 3362.80]  Oh my God.
[3363.68 --> 3364.00]  What?
[3364.12 --> 3364.68]  No, no, he got it.
[3364.76 --> 3365.48]  He got it.
[3365.52 --> 3365.80]  He got it.
[3365.90 --> 3366.86]  I hate when it's like flat.
[3367.34 --> 3367.62]  Okay.
[3367.68 --> 3368.82]  So don't, don't worry about it.
[3368.82 --> 3369.84]  So we get five balls.
[3370.00 --> 3374.30]  We were going to play pong, but we couldn't find a pong that would accelerate the ball in
[3374.30 --> 3375.10]  between shots.
[3376.00 --> 3378.14]  We couldn't find a web pong that would work properly.
[3378.30 --> 3378.80]  That's weird.
[3378.84 --> 3380.40]  Cause that's just how pong works, isn't it?
[3380.52 --> 3381.80]  It gets faster as you play.
[3381.80 --> 3382.80]  Okay.
[3384.06 --> 3384.26]  Okay.
[3384.32 --> 3386.02]  The audio doesn't really matter that much.
[3386.08 --> 3387.38]  It doesn't really matter that much.
[3387.76 --> 3388.98]  But a lot of you were able to see the camera.
[3388.98 --> 3390.86]  You should just, I'm just going to turn the audio off.
[3390.98 --> 3391.40]  Forget it.
[3391.40 --> 3408.18]  So basically, he's cruising along and then just gets absolutely completely just bamboozled.
[3408.66 --> 3411.04]  So he's got to get 102 points to beat me.
[3411.36 --> 3412.18]  Oh, that was close.
[3412.28 --> 3413.96]  And he's used up three balls now.
[3413.96 --> 3420.70]  Is the orange and the red just like that?
[3420.88 --> 3426.72]  No, they, they speed it up, but I don't think they're supposed to actually change the angle.
[3426.90 --> 3427.28]  The angle.
[3427.48 --> 3427.72]  Yeah.
[3427.88 --> 3431.00]  But the, but the higher bricks are worth way more points.
[3431.26 --> 3432.96]  So the lower ones are worth one each.
[3433.00 --> 3436.06]  And then I think it goes up to three and then like five or seven or something.
[3436.30 --> 3441.20]  But it just like, it just tosses it on a weird, look at your face.
[3441.20 --> 3441.98]  You love this.
[3442.04 --> 3444.02]  I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.
[3444.20 --> 3445.68]  I couldn't believe it.
[3445.68 --> 3451.74]  I felt, I mean, I like winning, obviously, but I felt terrible for the guy because that
[3451.74 --> 3453.06]  was ridiculous.
[3453.10 --> 3453.74]  That is ridiculous.
[3453.80 --> 3457.58]  And with how leggy the controls were, you can't be reacting to like.
[3457.60 --> 3458.08]  You were going to catch it.
[3458.20 --> 3458.32]  Yeah.
[3459.46 --> 3459.86]  Yeah.
[3459.94 --> 3463.06]  Especially the first one would just, it looked completely broken.
[3463.34 --> 3464.06]  I just, I don't know.
[3464.06 --> 3464.32]  Yeah.
[3464.42 --> 3464.84]  Oh yeah.
[3464.88 --> 3465.78]  No, it was ridiculous.
[3466.06 --> 3469.02]  That's, that's unfortunate when you, when you don't like prep the games ahead of time.
[3469.02 --> 3472.08]  Well, honestly, we had the same issue in drunken fight simulator.
[3473.52 --> 3477.48]  Like it didn't, I swear to you, the controls are worse than they were when we played.
[3479.78 --> 3480.62]  Markedly worse.
[3481.58 --> 3483.06]  Very noticeably worse.
[3483.46 --> 3487.12]  Like we could barely, we could barely orient our guys to face the same way.
[3487.18 --> 3488.62]  And the animations weren't even smooth.
[3488.70 --> 3492.04]  Like sometimes you could get them to turn a little bit.
[3492.10 --> 3495.02]  I think, I think it worked better the time that we played.
[3495.08 --> 3497.10]  And obviously the game hasn't been patched.
[3497.10 --> 3498.16]  I mean, that's probably why.
[3498.26 --> 3498.86]  Like, come on.
[3499.40 --> 3499.74]  Right.
[3499.82 --> 3502.00]  So it barely worked at all.
[3504.64 --> 3504.96]  Epic.
[3505.32 --> 3505.68]  Yeah.
[3505.78 --> 3505.98]  Yeah.
[3506.02 --> 3507.16]  It was, it was a lot of fun though.
[3507.24 --> 3508.84]  He was an absolutely great host.
[3508.84 --> 3512.54]  What I said about him on the yard, I, I stand by 100%.
[3512.54 --> 3515.12]  I think that he is an S tier host.
[3515.64 --> 3518.10]  I think he's a born entertainer.
[3518.10 --> 3518.42]  Yeah.
[3518.50 --> 3521.46]  And you could basically drop him into pretty much anything.
[3521.46 --> 3525.92]  And he would manage to, to, to find the entertainment, find the humor.
[3526.70 --> 3529.94]  And it just, it doesn't surprise me what a success the guy's been.
[3529.94 --> 3533.42]  Even if, you know, like I said, I don't, I don't watch a ton of content.
[3533.66 --> 3536.36]  And honestly, the rest of the, the rest of the team was great.
[3536.40 --> 3538.80]  I was razzing them a little bit on the podcast.
[3538.92 --> 3539.82]  I don't know if you've watched it.
[3539.86 --> 3541.36]  You, you listened to the yard, right?
[3541.48 --> 3542.00]  It's up now.
[3542.14 --> 3542.88]  Uh, not.
[3543.00 --> 3543.80]  Are you used to anyway?
[3543.80 --> 3544.12]  Yeah.
[3544.60 --> 3546.82]  Uh, I will probably listen to it at some point.
[3546.92 --> 3551.74]  I, my thing with the yard is I, I had this great appreciation for the yard because, um,
[3552.26 --> 3556.36]  I, I gained a ton of weight over COVID and the, the best and safest thing for me to do
[3556.36 --> 3557.66]  for a while was just go walk.
[3557.76 --> 3560.34]  So I would walk for like hour and a half to two hours every day.
[3560.38 --> 3560.62]  Right.
[3560.70 --> 3561.72]  Just to get tons of steps in.
[3561.84 --> 3567.04]  So I would listen to just the yard constantly cause it was really entertaining and it would
[3567.04 --> 3568.66]  make me, I would want to listen to it.
[3568.70 --> 3571.86]  So I would want to go outside and walk cause I wouldn't let myself listen to it without walking.
[3571.86 --> 3575.52]  Having been on it, I still don't understand what it is about.
[3576.78 --> 3578.20]  What is the podcast about?
[3578.28 --> 3580.68]  Is it just white guys talk about things podcast?
[3580.84 --> 3581.26]  Cause yeah.
[3581.86 --> 3582.26]  All right.
[3582.48 --> 3582.80]  Yeah.
[3582.90 --> 3583.08]  Yeah.
[3583.08 --> 3583.58]  Fair enough.
[3583.72 --> 3584.24]  I guess.
[3584.70 --> 3585.84]  It's about white women and dogs.
[3586.50 --> 3588.62]  It's all right.
[3589.06 --> 3591.00]  It's just, that's, that's the topic.
[3591.10 --> 3591.74]  That's what it's about.
[3591.90 --> 3592.24]  Sure.
[3592.34 --> 3592.56]  Yeah.
[3592.58 --> 3596.26]  Cause they like there wasn't, it didn't seem like, I don't think there's like a set
[3596.26 --> 3600.70]  like this is, this is like a tech news show, but what do we talk about half the time?
[3601.86 --> 3602.96]  What's the point of this show?
[3604.30 --> 3605.08]  I don't know.
[3605.18 --> 3605.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[3605.96 --> 3606.50]  What's the point of it?
[3606.50 --> 3606.94]  Who knows?
[3607.28 --> 3607.66]  I don't know.
[3607.72 --> 3608.56]  It's called the yard.
[3608.70 --> 3610.86]  It's like some dude sitting in chairs in a yard.
[3612.30 --> 3618.70]  Called them out hard on their like tier, like little bro controller set up for their guests.
[3619.08 --> 3619.64]  Oh, is it bad?
[3619.70 --> 3620.78]  They all had like really nice.
[3620.78 --> 3621.14]  That's another thing.
[3621.20 --> 3622.82]  I don't watch it cause I would just listen to it.
[3622.86 --> 3623.22]  I was walking.
[3623.32 --> 3626.24]  They have really nice mic arms so they can like shift in their chair.
[3626.24 --> 3626.64]  Yeah.
[3627.12 --> 3629.62]  And like have their mic like right next to their mouth and stuff.
[3629.82 --> 3632.08]  And I'm just, mine's just on like a light stand.
[3632.90 --> 3636.76]  So I do like sit up like I had a broomstick up my butt the whole time.
[3638.02 --> 3640.36]  And to be clear, it was, it was fine.
[3640.44 --> 3642.04]  They were all very courteous guests.
[3642.12 --> 3645.56]  I gave the, I gave the rest of the guys a bit of a, of a, like I razzed them a little
[3645.56 --> 3645.76]  bit.
[3645.80 --> 3647.24]  It was like, I don't even know who you guys are.
[3647.24 --> 3650.60]  Um, but they were absolutely fantastic.
[3650.60 --> 3654.36]  And I, I was mostly just leaning into it later just to, just to rav them.
[3654.36 --> 3656.70]  Cause it's not like they didn't take their opportunities with me.
[3658.54 --> 3659.24]  I'm sure.
[3659.46 --> 3659.74]  Yeah.
[3659.74 --> 3663.80]  We didn't even make it through bro versus bro without him bringing up the, the hard
[3663.80 --> 3664.54]  R incident.
[3664.86 --> 3665.46]  Oh really?
[3665.58 --> 3665.70]  Yeah.
[3665.70 --> 3667.04]  I didn't realize that.
[3667.22 --> 3669.06]  I suspected they would have on the yard.
[3669.06 --> 3674.40]  Out of all the meme faces and like everything that's gone on here in the 11 years that I've
[3674.40 --> 3676.04]  been doing this at Linus Media Group.
[3676.04 --> 3681.76]  Really the hard R one is the one that has made its way into the general consciousness.
[3681.76 --> 3683.38]  I think more than anything else.
[3683.38 --> 3688.56]  And for those of you who aren't familiar, um, on an episode of the WAN show some time
[3688.56 --> 3696.44]  ago, I don't even remember, but I, I, I alluded to having used what I thought that meant.
[3696.44 --> 3702.44]  I thought it meant, I thought it meant something else, the mental disability slur.
[3702.44 --> 3707.68]  And I was talking about how it was culturally acceptable to use it in the early two thousands,
[3707.68 --> 3708.82]  like in high school.
[3709.32 --> 3713.58]  And I referred to it as the hard R thinking that that's what that meant.
[3713.58 --> 3718.36]  But I found out that means a very different word that in fact doesn't begin with R.
[3718.36 --> 3719.36]  Yeah.
[3719.36 --> 3720.20]  But there's, okay.
[3720.20 --> 3725.68]  Why would, why would it be, why, what, how does the word hard make any sense with the
[3725.68 --> 3726.20]  previous one?
[3726.20 --> 3726.82]  I don't know.
[3726.90 --> 3728.60]  Well, because it's, it's a hard word.
[3728.70 --> 3729.46]  I don't know.
[3730.00 --> 3730.98]  I don't know.
[3731.06 --> 3731.46]  I just didn't know.
[3731.46 --> 3733.94]  They're talking about how you pronounce the R at the end of the word.
[3733.94 --> 3735.26]  I understand now.
[3735.38 --> 3737.28]  Thank you very much, Professor Linguistics.
[3737.28 --> 3742.84]  You know, the worst part about this for me is people just constantly bring it up around
[3742.84 --> 3743.10]  me.
[3744.74 --> 3746.56]  I'm like, I don't want to talk about this.
[3746.76 --> 3748.14]  Like, what do you mean?
[3748.50 --> 3751.50]  Like, I'll have, I'll, I'll have never met this person before.
[3751.60 --> 3752.92]  Don't know that they know me or anything.
[3752.98 --> 3754.46]  And they'll just walk up and be like, hard R.
[3754.54 --> 3755.50]  I'm like, why?
[3755.60 --> 3758.50]  I don't want anyone around me to hear that you're saying this to me.
[3758.50 --> 3763.46]  Like, I don't, like if we're in private conversation, maybe, but people are just walking up to me and
[3763.46 --> 3771.86]  saying hard R in public and I'm like, what, I don't, what do you, so you've, yeah, you've
[3771.86 --> 3773.84]  cursed me if that, if that makes you feel any better.
[3773.98 --> 3774.64]  That's pretty funny.
[3774.94 --> 3775.22]  Yeah.
[3775.80 --> 3776.92]  I thought you might like that.
[3777.02 --> 3777.20]  Yeah.
[3777.90 --> 3780.84]  I mean, I mean, how many things in your life are cursed because of me?
[3781.10 --> 3782.22]  Probably a lot.
[3782.24 --> 3783.60]  That can't be the worst one.
[3784.10 --> 3784.50]  Yeah.
[3784.50 --> 3785.04]  I don't know.
[3785.48 --> 3786.26]  Oh man.
[3786.60 --> 3786.80]  Yeah.
[3786.80 --> 3787.32]  That's great.
[3788.32 --> 3793.38]  I had the pleasure of, I had the pleasure of bringing up the ice
[3793.38 --> 3796.18]  climbers video that you linked me to.
[3796.38 --> 3797.84]  The best YouTube video of all time.
[3797.84 --> 3798.02]  Yeah.
[3798.14 --> 3803.12]  So poor Ludwig got to realize that the only video I'd ever watched of him was actually
[3803.12 --> 3809.62]  Slime's video, which I didn't realize as I'm sitting there on their podcast.
[3810.36 --> 3811.00]  Oh man.
[3811.00 --> 3816.26]  I found them through SlimeWire as well, Slime's channel.
[3816.54 --> 3819.50]  I didn't actually, because I don't watch streams at all, ever.
[3820.02 --> 3822.56]  I had no idea how profitable podcasting was.
[3822.56 --> 3828.92]  I think they make more on the yard than we do on any individual property.
[3829.12 --> 3829.84]  Including Wancho.
[3830.04 --> 3834.24]  Like they have 40,000 subscribers to just the weekly podcast.
[3834.30 --> 3834.64]  Oh yeah.
[3834.82 --> 3836.24]  I mean, why do we do Wancho for free?
[3836.28 --> 3837.60]  Wait, what's the point of the subscribers?
[3837.72 --> 3838.84]  Do they get it early or something?
[3839.02 --> 3839.30]  Or like...
[3839.30 --> 3840.98]  They get a decent amount of extra content.
[3841.18 --> 3841.76]  Oh, do they?
[3841.86 --> 3842.10]  Okay.
[3842.20 --> 3842.42]  Yeah.
[3842.42 --> 3842.64]  All right.
[3842.68 --> 3843.28]  That's kind of cool.
[3843.34 --> 3846.76]  The yard's Patreon is actually like pretty good.
[3846.86 --> 3847.00]  Yeah.
[3847.00 --> 3848.70]  Maybe we should learn some things.
[3848.98 --> 3849.10]  Yeah.
[3849.10 --> 3849.70]  I'm going to your laptop.
[3849.70 --> 3851.72]  I mean, I've brought them up a few times.
[3852.30 --> 3853.36]  Oh, get out of here.
[3853.66 --> 3855.36]  No one will respond to that if you email it.
[3855.36 --> 3859.52]  I don't know if it's going to show here, but yeah, I see premium episodes.
[3861.04 --> 3861.72]  I don't know.
[3861.90 --> 3862.06]  Oh, okay.
[3862.24 --> 3862.56]  I don't know.
[3862.62 --> 3864.68]  Like, do they do a thing at the end of the show or something?
[3864.80 --> 3865.66]  It didn't seem like it.
[3865.66 --> 3866.52]  Not with me anyway.
[3866.64 --> 3870.08]  It seemed like everything we shot was the thing that was uploaded.
[3870.54 --> 3871.10]  So...
[3871.10 --> 3871.36]  Yeah.
[3871.42 --> 3872.64]  So they have premium episodes.
[3872.80 --> 3874.22]  They have this, yeah, Aiden's Advice.
[3874.22 --> 3876.50]  I don't know.
[3876.58 --> 3877.42]  They've got other stuff.
[3877.50 --> 3879.54]  So there's a bunch of extra content.
[3879.70 --> 3881.70]  I think there's a pretty big lean on extra content.
[3881.86 --> 3882.20]  Got it.
[3882.20 --> 3882.48]  Okay.
[3882.48 --> 3885.92]  And then there's, you know, Discord access, the normal stuff, postcards.
[3886.00 --> 3886.64]  I don't know what's up with that.
[3886.72 --> 3888.00]  First look at all merch and discounts.
[3888.12 --> 3888.70]  That's cool.
[3888.82 --> 3888.98]  Yeah.
[3889.02 --> 3892.36]  So their merch sells out crazy fast as far as I can tell.
[3892.52 --> 3895.44]  Like they had like a coffee book or something.
[3895.44 --> 3895.82]  Yeah.
[3895.90 --> 3898.90]  Coffee book, like coffee table book or whatever they're called.
[3899.14 --> 3899.32]  Sure.
[3899.32 --> 3903.26]  And apparently it's sold out in like five minutes and they have to do a second printing
[3903.26 --> 3904.32]  now or something like that.
[3904.38 --> 3904.90]  That's wild.
[3905.72 --> 3907.86]  Oh, they have a cool tier at the end there that I'm not going to say.
[3908.14 --> 3911.86]  Linus figures out something he does for four plus hours a week can make money.
[3911.94 --> 3912.06]  Okay.
[3912.10 --> 3913.46]  I know it can make money.
[3913.72 --> 3915.42]  It's just that it could make more.
[3915.64 --> 3923.10]  The point is just that I had no idea how invested people get in like podcasts.
[3923.10 --> 3925.18]  Like I just, yeah, I don't know.
[3925.26 --> 3925.50]  I don't know.
[3925.54 --> 3927.16]  I don't consume them.
[3927.32 --> 3929.08]  This is one of those things that I don't consume.
[3929.08 --> 3931.40]  So they're selling a natural just lawn chair.
[3931.90 --> 3932.26]  Yeah.
[3932.54 --> 3933.40]  It's pretty comfy.
[3933.58 --> 3935.16]  I sat on it during bro versus bro.
[3935.24 --> 3936.38]  It's a rocking lawn chair.
[3937.02 --> 3937.72]  That's funny.
[3938.02 --> 3938.22]  Yeah.
[3938.22 --> 3938.84]  Why not?
[3938.90 --> 3939.10]  Right.
[3939.26 --> 3939.42]  Yeah.
[3939.42 --> 3939.62]  I don't know.
[3939.68 --> 3940.50]  We made a screwdriver.
[3940.80 --> 3941.12]  Who knows?
[3941.22 --> 3941.74]  Yeah, exactly.
[3941.86 --> 3943.06]  Here's what I was talking about.
[3943.12 --> 3947.20]  It's a little blurred because I'm not subscribed to their Patreon, but yeah, see the chair there.
[3947.28 --> 3948.16]  But it's a lawn chair.
[3948.32 --> 3948.44]  Yeah.
[3948.44 --> 3949.14]  They kill it.
[3949.30 --> 3952.42]  They 42,583 members.
[3952.58 --> 3954.86]  That's some monster member count.
[3956.32 --> 3956.64]  Yeah.
[3956.76 --> 3957.14]  Heck yeah.
[3957.14 --> 3957.70]  No kidding.
[3957.70 --> 3960.88]  It definitely made me feel like we need a set upgrade.
[3961.32 --> 3969.22]  We are probably, we are probably, we probably have the highest sort of general reach and influence
[3969.22 --> 3976.28]  to set construction quality ratio on the internet at this point.
[3976.28 --> 3980.30]  Like the WAN show is low key, a gigantic podcast.
[3980.84 --> 3986.20]  Like we have anywhere from 600 to 700,000 weekly viewers of the video thing.
[3986.28 --> 3992.18]  I don't even know how many people watch it or listen to it on podcast platforms, but Ludwig
[3992.18 --> 3997.50]  pointed out to me that thousands of people apparently watch on Twitter, which I had, I didn't even
[3997.50 --> 3997.84]  know.
[3998.14 --> 3999.10]  We just like turn it on.
[3999.16 --> 4000.72]  I think it never looked at once.
[4000.72 --> 4004.18]  I have no, I have never once looked at how many people are watching on Twitter.
[4004.18 --> 4004.44]  I don't think any of us did.
[4004.66 --> 4005.64]  We are streaming set up.
[4005.70 --> 4007.16]  We can just like add streaming destinations.
[4007.32 --> 4007.78]  No problem.
[4007.98 --> 4008.20]  Yeah.
[4008.36 --> 4009.86]  So we should just stream everywhere.
[4010.18 --> 4010.54]  Every once in a while.
[4010.60 --> 4012.58]  We're just like, Oh, there's another one we didn't think of.
[4012.66 --> 4013.50]  We're on TikTok now.
[4013.92 --> 4014.14]  Yeah.
[4014.28 --> 4015.08]  Do you know about that?
[4015.30 --> 4015.74]  We're on TikTok.
[4015.74 --> 4016.00]  We're on TikTok.
[4016.28 --> 4016.72]  Right now.
[4016.98 --> 4017.16]  Yeah.
[4017.40 --> 4017.46]  Yeah.
[4017.46 --> 4017.76]  I TikTok.
[4017.76 --> 4019.58]  Holy f***ing s***.
[4019.84 --> 4023.06]  There are 11,000 people apparently watching on Twitter.
[4023.22 --> 4023.94]  Sup dudes.
[4025.94 --> 4027.54]  What are you even doing with your life?
[4027.62 --> 4028.42]  Why are you watching live?
[4028.60 --> 4030.56]  Why are you watching a four hour video on Twitter?
[4031.84 --> 4032.32]  Yes.
[4032.38 --> 4033.36]  You're being called out.
[4033.36 --> 4034.42]  Get attacked.
[4035.76 --> 4037.54]  Why would you watch this show?
[4037.86 --> 4039.14]  Go outside nerds.
[4039.14 --> 4040.46]  Touch some grass.
[4040.62 --> 4041.98]  It's fine to watch the show.
[4042.00 --> 4042.42]  Get off the internet.
[4043.56 --> 4045.14]  It's just funny watching it on Twitter.
[4045.14 --> 4048.42]  Apparently our chat is verified only.
[4048.56 --> 4049.70]  Can we un that it?
[4049.82 --> 4050.94]  Because that's cringe.
[4051.08 --> 4052.22]  That'll probably get so...
[4052.22 --> 4053.72]  Oh, I'll deal with that.
[4053.78 --> 4054.62]  Dude, I'm not...
[4054.62 --> 4055.84]  No, no, I'm not...
[4055.84 --> 4056.40]  No, you're right.
[4056.50 --> 4056.78]  You're right.
[4056.84 --> 4057.56]  I'm just saying...
[4057.56 --> 4058.84]  I'm not going to even begin.
[4059.34 --> 4060.34]  Think about unmoderated...
[4060.34 --> 4060.98]  I'm not even...
[4060.98 --> 4061.68]  I don't even care.
[4061.68 --> 4062.54]  Fully free form...
[4062.54 --> 4062.84]  Luke.
[4062.90 --> 4063.52]  Twitter chat.
[4063.52 --> 4066.96]  Luke, this is the very last time that I am ever going to look at it.
[4067.74 --> 4069.08]  So it doesn't matter.
[4069.18 --> 4069.48]  That's probably true.
[4069.70 --> 4071.40]  How long have we even been streaming on there?
[4071.52 --> 4071.88]  I don't know.
[4072.02 --> 4073.40]  A few weeks now?
[4073.52 --> 4073.88]  A few weeks?
[4073.88 --> 4074.58]  Something like that?
[4074.68 --> 4075.00]  I don't know.
[4075.00 --> 4075.88]  No one looks...
[4075.88 --> 4076.46]  No one has any idea.
[4076.46 --> 4078.30]  I mean, are these just all bots anyway?
[4078.50 --> 4079.20]  Like, look...
[4079.20 --> 4079.52]  Probably.
[4079.52 --> 4080.52]  Don't look at the comments.
[4080.62 --> 4083.48]  Buddy here is like, didn't even know this was a thing.
[4083.68 --> 4083.88]  Yeah.
[4083.88 --> 4085.80]  So, pretty active chat.
[4085.80 --> 4087.24]  Is that the only verified user?
[4087.50 --> 4088.08]  I don't know.
[4088.14 --> 4090.18]  Because it's verified only chat and that's the only comment?
[4090.18 --> 4092.34]  I don't know if you can check the user list or anything.
[4092.34 --> 4093.16]  I think I like that.
[4093.28 --> 4093.74]  That's good.
[4094.08 --> 4095.10]  We should keep it that way.
[4095.34 --> 4096.24]  Sup, Mario.
[4097.54 --> 4097.90]  All right.
[4097.96 --> 4098.52]  Well, there you go.
[4098.52 --> 4099.40]  There's two of them now.
[4099.52 --> 4100.56]  Things are taking off a little bit.
[4100.56 --> 4101.02]  This is bad.
[4101.14 --> 4101.74]  Yeah, that's probably...
[4101.74 --> 4102.34]  We gotta get out of here.
[4102.44 --> 4103.40]  We gotta not encourage this.
[4103.46 --> 4104.54]  That's the end of the attention
[4104.54 --> 4105.88]  for the Twitter chat.
[4106.02 --> 4106.14]  Yeah.
[4107.14 --> 4108.70]  That is hilarious.
[4108.76 --> 4110.42]  I wonder what Ludwig thinks about us being
[4110.42 --> 4113.42]  openly hostile against most of our viewership
[4113.42 --> 4114.50]  of the Wancho.
[4115.24 --> 4115.68]  No.
[4115.98 --> 4116.46]  No.
[4116.68 --> 4119.82]  We are not openly hostile to most of the viewership.
[4119.82 --> 4122.98]  We are openly hostile toward most of the viewing platforms.
[4123.82 --> 4127.68]  We are openly hostile to Twitch, Twitter, Facebook.
[4127.68 --> 4129.94]  Actually, Facebook we're more just ambivalent about.
[4130.10 --> 4130.34]  Yeah.
[4130.52 --> 4131.74]  We got 18 on Facebook.
[4131.92 --> 4132.76]  Yeah, exactly.
[4133.36 --> 4134.10]  We love you guys.
[4134.10 --> 4135.86]  Those are our real viewers.
[4136.20 --> 4137.38]  It's Luke's mom.
[4137.50 --> 4139.68]  In the words of Nikita from Battlestate Games,
[4139.68 --> 4140.08]  actually,
[4140.22 --> 4141.16]  those are the true believers.
[4141.22 --> 4144.72]  Luke's mom is legit way too tech savvy to be watching on Facebook.
[4145.06 --> 4145.26]  Yeah.
[4145.64 --> 4145.92]  Yeah.
[4146.20 --> 4147.68]  She has a float plane account.
[4148.24 --> 4148.60]  Exactly.
[4148.96 --> 4149.38]  Got him.
[4151.70 --> 4152.06]  Yeah.
[4152.26 --> 4153.58]  And I don't know.
[4153.66 --> 4155.38]  I don't think we're openly hostile to TikTok.
[4155.56 --> 4156.76]  How many people are watching on TikTok?
[4157.04 --> 4158.32]  Well, you didn't even know they existed.
[4158.40 --> 4159.36]  You got 238.
[4159.36 --> 4160.26]  241.
[4160.32 --> 4160.54]  Yeah.
[4160.64 --> 4160.96]  Dang.
[4161.60 --> 4162.66]  That kind of makes sense.
[4162.70 --> 4164.72]  Who would be watching this on TikTok like that?
[4164.82 --> 4164.94]  Yeah.
[4165.20 --> 4165.38]  Yeah.
[4165.42 --> 4165.64]  Sure.
[4165.68 --> 4165.92]  Well, I mean,
[4165.98 --> 4167.16]  this is our second week doing it.
[4167.16 --> 4168.14]  Last week we had like 10.
[4168.74 --> 4170.80]  Oh, so we doubled is what you're trying to say.
[4171.06 --> 4172.34]  200 is more.
[4172.68 --> 4172.82]  Oh.
[4172.82 --> 4172.92]  Oh.
[4172.92 --> 4175.88]  Oh, so we 20x'd.
[4176.06 --> 4176.38]  Yeah.
[4177.58 --> 4178.48]  I don't remember.
[4178.48 --> 4180.14]  I think part of the problem is there's like,
[4180.20 --> 4180.94]  there is a WAN,
[4181.10 --> 4184.14]  there is a account on TikTok called the WAN show,
[4184.26 --> 4187.20]  but our actual account is called the dot WAN dot show.
[4187.82 --> 4188.22]  Seriously?
[4188.54 --> 4188.76]  Yeah.
[4188.84 --> 4190.36]  So I wasn't even on the right page.
[4190.52 --> 4192.12]  This shows you what I know about TikTok.
[4192.24 --> 4192.26]  Yeah.
[4192.26 --> 4194.98]  Like we don't stream WAN show on the Linus Tech Tips TikTok.
[4195.20 --> 4195.86]  I don't know why.
[4196.62 --> 4197.22]  Maybe that,
[4197.38 --> 4198.48]  I'm sure someone,
[4198.74 --> 4199.82]  there's some reason for that.
[4199.94 --> 4200.18]  I'm sure.
[4200.38 --> 4200.68]  Yeah.
[4200.68 --> 4201.24]  Hey, look at that.
[4201.24 --> 4202.34]  But here's the like,
[4202.44 --> 4202.64]  yeah,
[4202.72 --> 4203.38]  that's the real one.
[4203.38 --> 4203.56]  Wait,
[4203.60 --> 4204.34]  it's not vertical,
[4204.34 --> 4204.86]  is it?
[4205.24 --> 4205.70]  I don't know.
[4205.70 --> 4205.88]  Oh no,
[4205.92 --> 4206.48]  these are clips.
[4206.72 --> 4206.74]  Thankfully,
[4206.82 --> 4207.14]  no.
[4207.34 --> 4207.46]  Oh,
[4207.48 --> 4208.08]  this is hilarious.
[4208.22 --> 4208.88]  These are clips.
[4209.56 --> 4209.92]  Okay.
[4210.32 --> 4212.02]  So the WAN show is live.
[4212.64 --> 4212.86]  Okay.
[4212.94 --> 4213.20]  Okay.
[4213.20 --> 4213.76]  So Dan,
[4213.84 --> 4214.16]  what's our,
[4214.24 --> 4215.22]  what's our Spotify numbers?
[4215.26 --> 4220.28]  I hope they're good because like I low key legitimately thought that the,
[4220.28 --> 4222.14]  the WAN show is like kind of a big podcast.
[4222.14 --> 4224.96]  And if I find out now that it's actually a really small podcast,
[4224.96 --> 4226.38]  then my PP will get very small.
[4226.58 --> 4226.66]  Well,
[4226.68 --> 4226.88]  I mean,
[4226.90 --> 4227.10]  we're,
[4227.10 --> 4228.94]  we're fourth in the U S for tech.
[4229.58 --> 4229.82]  Oh,
[4229.90 --> 4230.38]  like news.
[4230.38 --> 4231.32]  That seems kind of,
[4231.44 --> 4232.98]  it looks like 500,
[4232.98 --> 4234.20]  even on the podium then.
[4234.36 --> 4236.64]  So 500,000 listeners in the last month.
[4236.94 --> 4237.12]  Oh,
[4237.14 --> 4238.50]  that seems like a fair bit.
[4238.70 --> 4239.14]  I don't know.
[4239.24 --> 4239.60]  Is that,
[4239.70 --> 4240.40]  I have no idea.
[4240.54 --> 4241.00]  I have no context.
[4241.00 --> 4242.10]  Super related.
[4242.40 --> 4246.00]  Like they're like a cryptocurrency trading podcast and stuff.
[4246.08 --> 4247.84]  Like it's anything that could fall under tech.
[4247.92 --> 4248.12]  Okay.
[4248.18 --> 4249.60]  So what are the,
[4249.70 --> 4250.56]  what are the ones ahead of us,
[4250.64 --> 4250.76]  Dan?
[4250.84 --> 4251.04]  Again,
[4251.14 --> 4252.70]  there's a cybersecurity one,
[4252.84 --> 4254.02]  cryptocurrency one,
[4254.02 --> 4255.60]  and a wall street journal.
[4255.60 --> 4257.26]  How do we find this wall street journal?
[4257.42 --> 4257.70]  Uh,
[4257.70 --> 4259.12]  it comes to my email.
[4259.32 --> 4259.48]  Oh,
[4259.68 --> 4260.44]  uh,
[4260.48 --> 4263.78]  do you have a way of screen sharing or just forward it to one of these accounts?
[4263.92 --> 4265.46]  I will try and find it.
[4265.52 --> 4267.14]  That might take too long.
[4267.54 --> 4272.12]  So apparently there's a theory on why the WAN show is so big.
[4272.50 --> 4272.90]  Okay.
[4272.90 --> 4275.06]  And it's because people fall asleep.
[4275.42 --> 4276.80]  And then when they wake up,
[4276.84 --> 4278.20]  they're watching the WAN show.
[4278.32 --> 4282.20]  They were talking about this on the way for podcast a week or two ago.
[4283.06 --> 4283.46]  Wow.
[4283.46 --> 4283.92]  They're like,
[4283.98 --> 4284.08]  yeah,
[4284.14 --> 4285.10]  how often is it?
[4285.22 --> 4286.98]  How often is it that you go to sleep?
[4287.28 --> 4288.40]  And when you wake up,
[4288.44 --> 4291.44]  you're listening to Linus and Luke talk about tech on the WAN show.
[4291.48 --> 4293.02]  And they were like very often,
[4293.26 --> 4295.66]  which I think is pretty funny.
[4296.08 --> 4297.98]  Who's sleeping for like three hours.
[4298.16 --> 4299.02]  Full plane chat is like,
[4299.10 --> 4299.24]  no,
[4299.30 --> 4300.46]  this is a hundred percent of thing.
[4300.52 --> 4301.70]  This happens to me every day.
[4301.70 --> 4301.96]  They're sleeping for,
[4302.12 --> 4302.96]  fix your sleep schedule.
[4302.96 --> 4303.18]  No,
[4303.18 --> 4303.30]  no,
[4303.30 --> 4303.42]  no,
[4303.42 --> 4303.62]  no,
[4303.62 --> 4303.66]  no,
[4303.66 --> 4303.76]  no.
[4303.76 --> 4305.22]  They're not sleeping for three hours.
[4305.44 --> 4310.34]  They go to sleep listening to something and then it auto plays all night.
[4310.86 --> 4313.92]  And they wake up in the middle of a six hour WAN show.
[4313.92 --> 4315.38]  It ends up landing on WAN show.
[4315.52 --> 4315.96]  Exactly.
[4316.38 --> 4316.98]  Got it.
[4317.24 --> 4317.50]  Well,
[4317.60 --> 4317.92]  okay.
[4318.02 --> 4319.82]  Then everyone else just needs to figure out their game.
[4320.20 --> 4320.96]  Figure out the market,
[4321.08 --> 4321.22]  man.
[4321.28 --> 4322.10]  We cornered our niche.
[4322.18 --> 4322.98]  It's sleeping people.
[4323.12 --> 4323.36]  Okay.
[4325.96 --> 4327.06]  You can find your own.
[4327.06 --> 4328.28]  And the show is so long.
[4328.28 --> 4331.28]  So we can have every single keyword in the video description.
[4331.70 --> 4332.14]  Yeah.
[4332.14 --> 4333.28]  And in the timestamps.
[4333.28 --> 4333.64]  Yeah.
[4334.42 --> 4334.82]  Yeah.
[4336.08 --> 4336.38]  All right.
[4336.38 --> 4337.30]  You just got to figure it out.
[4337.40 --> 4337.58]  Oh,
[4337.60 --> 4338.42]  that's fantastic.
[4339.44 --> 4339.84]  Fantastic.
[4340.18 --> 4340.52]  Okay.
[4340.58 --> 4341.02]  So Dan,
[4341.16 --> 4341.82]  do you,
[4341.88 --> 4342.60]  do you have the list?
[4342.92 --> 4343.32]  No,
[4343.40 --> 4344.74]  I'm looking for it currently.
[4344.90 --> 4345.14]  Okay,
[4345.14 --> 4345.40]  fine.
[4345.46 --> 4345.86]  You can just,
[4345.96 --> 4346.72]  you can just,
[4346.84 --> 4347.80]  or like,
[4347.88 --> 4348.80]  can you just,
[4348.90 --> 4350.64]  is this something you can just search for?
[4350.74 --> 4351.30]  Like the,
[4351.68 --> 4352.00]  Oh,
[4352.10 --> 4353.08]  I might be able to find it.
[4353.30 --> 4353.58]  Hold on.
[4353.58 --> 4355.40]  I don't know how Spotify works.
[4355.76 --> 4357.28]  We're not on Spotify.
[4357.60 --> 4361.02]  We're using a new thing called megaphone by Spotify.
[4361.82 --> 4361.94]  What?
[4362.54 --> 4362.92]  Yeah.
[4363.24 --> 4363.56]  Megaphone.
[4363.70 --> 4364.30]  Why do you,
[4364.42 --> 4365.10]  why do you,
[4365.10 --> 4366.34]  why do you need megaphones?
[4366.68 --> 4367.00]  Chartable.
[4367.36 --> 4367.60]  So,
[4367.72 --> 4368.08]  uh,
[4368.08 --> 4373.82]  megaphone allows us to simultaneously post it everywhere and also manage all of the podcasts simultaneously.
[4374.54 --> 4374.98]  Previously,
[4374.98 --> 4377.62]  what we would have to do is go to each individual.
[4378.50 --> 4378.94]  Um,
[4379.64 --> 4379.96]  Oh no,
[4379.96 --> 4380.58]  I don't want to sign up.
[4380.64 --> 4381.12]  I want to log in.
[4381.12 --> 4381.76]  Uh,
[4381.76 --> 4385.90]  we'd have to go to each individual platform and then post it there.
[4385.90 --> 4386.26]  Right.
[4386.28 --> 4388.12]  Cause we've got tech linked and game linked as a,
[4388.16 --> 4389.08]  as a podcast now.
[4390.28 --> 4391.96]  Chartable doesn't even show us in the top.
[4392.00 --> 4392.16]  Oh,
[4392.20 --> 4393.42]  it's United States of America.
[4393.90 --> 4394.30]  Okay.
[4394.60 --> 4396.18]  I'm looking at our statistics.
[4396.36 --> 4396.62]  Do you,
[4396.62 --> 4398.92]  do you make money on like a Spotify podcast?
[4399.68 --> 4399.92]  Uh,
[4399.96 --> 4400.26]  yes,
[4400.26 --> 4400.60]  we,
[4400.76 --> 4401.54]  we make money.
[4401.72 --> 4402.32]  Do we really?
[4402.62 --> 4402.82]  Yes.
[4402.98 --> 4406.16]  So one of the reasons they moved us over to megaphone was part of their,
[4406.16 --> 4406.98]  um,
[4407.06 --> 4407.52]  audience,
[4407.88 --> 4408.26]  uh,
[4408.26 --> 4409.56]  Spotify audience network,
[4409.56 --> 4410.82]  which allows us to,
[4410.82 --> 4412.30]  I'm so sorry,
[4412.44 --> 4412.76]  uh,
[4412.82 --> 4414.68]  do targeted advertising.
[4415.24 --> 4415.56]  Um,
[4415.64 --> 4420.18]  we can also insert advertisements as necessary and it's all sort of automated.
[4420.42 --> 4420.78]  Interesting.
[4420.88 --> 4423.88]  People know that they don't have to listen to those ads and they can just like watch on
[4423.88 --> 4425.68]  YouTube where we don't insert ads in the land show,
[4425.72 --> 4425.88]  right?
[4426.36 --> 4426.58]  Yeah.
[4426.62 --> 4428.64]  Or say you have something like Spotify premium.
[4428.76 --> 4430.50]  I don't believe the ads are served.
[4430.80 --> 4431.00]  Oh,
[4431.06 --> 4431.40]  got it.
[4431.40 --> 4431.70]  Okay.
[4432.58 --> 4432.78]  Well,
[4432.80 --> 4433.10]  that's,
[4433.18 --> 4433.38]  uh,
[4433.46 --> 4433.82]  that's,
[4433.90 --> 4434.50]  that's neat.
[4434.50 --> 4434.98]  I guess.
[4435.20 --> 4435.42]  Neat.
[4435.56 --> 4436.48]  Should we jump into a topic?
[4436.60 --> 4436.92]  Oh no,
[4436.96 --> 4438.36]  we're supposed to explain merch messages.
[4438.50 --> 4438.70]  Hey.
[4438.86 --> 4439.06]  Oh yeah,
[4439.10 --> 4439.30]  that's right.
[4439.30 --> 4441.62]  So while I was down there for Ludwig stream,
[4441.80 --> 4442.14]  someone,
[4442.32 --> 4442.80]  uh,
[4442.84 --> 4446.48]  sent him a super chat for 500 us dollars,
[4446.48 --> 4448.42]  which I thought was pretty wild.
[4448.42 --> 4448.94]  And,
[4449.16 --> 4449.50]  uh,
[4449.82 --> 4452.76]  and even he seemed like kind of taken aback by it.
[4452.80 --> 4453.20]  He was like,
[4453.22 --> 4453.36]  yeah,
[4453.36 --> 4454.62]  I have kind of a policy,
[4454.78 --> 4456.46]  anything above a hundred dollars.
[4456.46 --> 4462.90]  I don't give any kind of different reaction to because you want to encourage like degenerate behavior.
[4462.90 --> 4463.08]  Yeah.
[4463.08 --> 4467.12]  You don't want to encourage people to just be giving way too much money to people that,
[4467.30 --> 4467.44]  you know,
[4467.56 --> 4469.20]  because like some of those people,
[4469.54 --> 4471.30]  maybe that is totally fine for them,
[4471.30 --> 4472.64]  but you're also there.
[4473.32 --> 4479.70]  Some people are a little silly with their money sometimes and they'll see something like that happen and do it when that's the last hundred dollars they have left.
[4479.70 --> 4479.86]  Yeah,
[4479.86 --> 4481.06]  which they really shouldn't do.
[4481.12 --> 4483.18]  And I would never encourage someone to do.
[4483.28 --> 4483.50]  And like,
[4483.56 --> 4485.32]  maybe if it's the oil princes or whatever,
[4485.44 --> 4485.96]  like who cares?
[4486.06 --> 4486.18]  Yeah,
[4486.18 --> 4486.38]  sure.
[4486.44 --> 4486.70]  Why not?
[4486.74 --> 4489.54]  And then I think he said something along the lines of like anything above $500,
[4489.86 --> 4491.66]  he like doesn't acknowledge or something like that.
[4491.70 --> 4491.84]  Like,
[4491.88 --> 4494.36]  I can't remember exactly how he explained like his,
[4494.36 --> 4495.92]  his sort of personal approach to it.
[4496.30 --> 4496.60]  Um,
[4496.60 --> 4499.22]  our approach is I'll take your $500.
[4499.72 --> 4500.34]  In fact,
[4500.44 --> 4500.92]  I'll take a,
[4501.04 --> 4502.50]  I'll take $5,000,
[4502.90 --> 4504.68]  but in exchange,
[4504.96 --> 4505.50]  500,
[4505.98 --> 4510.52]  I will send you some fine merchandise from LTT store.com.
[4510.62 --> 4514.28]  We really do have an extremely broad range of products these days.
[4514.28 --> 4516.44]  We've got everything from your,
[4516.64 --> 4517.62]  from hats to,
[4517.62 --> 4518.46]  uh,
[4518.48 --> 4518.88]  oh man,
[4518.94 --> 4519.02]  we,
[4519.10 --> 4519.26]  oh,
[4519.30 --> 4520.72]  we've got some really cool new stuff this week.
[4520.82 --> 4521.64]  We've got hats,
[4521.72 --> 4522.52]  we've got tools,
[4522.66 --> 4524.38]  we've got cable organizers,
[4524.66 --> 4524.84]  man,
[4524.84 --> 4527.06]  this product is like my favorite thing ever.
[4527.18 --> 4527.88]  Look at this GIF,
[4528.44 --> 4528.70]  man.
[4528.74 --> 4529.30]  You just put that,
[4529.40 --> 4530.70]  put that little magnet on there.
[4530.76 --> 4531.40]  It's a GIF loop.
[4531.58 --> 4532.12]  Get over it.
[4532.42 --> 4533.60]  Put that little GIF on there.
[4534.26 --> 4534.66]  Reviews.
[4535.38 --> 4535.74]  Solid.
[4536.42 --> 4537.42]  Absolutely love it.
[4538.36 --> 4538.76]  Uh,
[4538.86 --> 4539.90]  I have to remove the triangle piece.
[4540.00 --> 4540.12]  Oh,
[4540.14 --> 4540.34]  okay.
[4541.12 --> 4542.14]  Product is great.
[4542.54 --> 4542.66]  Oh,
[4542.72 --> 4543.42]  shipping took long.
[4543.62 --> 4543.88]  Oh,
[4543.96 --> 4544.58]  that's too bad.
[4544.90 --> 4545.14]  Well,
[4545.48 --> 4549.48]  everyone says the product is great and I guess we need to get our shipping sorted out,
[4549.58 --> 4550.40]  but Hey,
[4550.42 --> 4551.76]  that's our transparency for you.
[4551.86 --> 4553.04]  So you can check out reviews.
[4553.16 --> 4554.06]  We've got a lot of great products.
[4554.06 --> 4555.48]  We've got some really cool stuff this week.
[4555.64 --> 4556.52]  Have you seen this yet,
[4556.58 --> 4556.76]  Luke?
[4558.28 --> 4558.68]  Uh,
[4558.76 --> 4559.06]  well,
[4559.14 --> 4560.52]  I'm wearing one of them.
[4560.98 --> 4561.36]  Oh,
[4561.60 --> 4563.00]  that is hilarious.
[4564.08 --> 4565.58]  Luke is wearing a dead pixel.
[4566.02 --> 4568.04]  It's the dead pixel collection,
[4568.36 --> 4568.68]  folks.
[4568.88 --> 4571.04]  And we've got so much cool stuff.
[4571.22 --> 4572.16]  Want to be the Vanna today?
[4572.70 --> 4572.90]  Uh,
[4572.96 --> 4573.24]  sure.
[4573.24 --> 4578.18]  We've got a dead pixel monitor enamel pin.
[4578.44 --> 4579.02]  It's on there.
[4579.66 --> 4580.24]  It's on there.
[4580.24 --> 4581.28]  It is a little hard to see.
[4581.42 --> 4582.26]  But that's the point.
[4582.72 --> 4583.18]  Can we get it?
[4583.18 --> 4583.42]  Yeah,
[4583.42 --> 4583.92]  there it is.
[4584.04 --> 4585.24]  There's a dead pixel on there.
[4585.76 --> 4586.06]  Oh,
[4586.24 --> 4586.72]  I got it.
[4586.88 --> 4589.44]  We've got a dead pixel sticker sheet.
[4589.70 --> 4592.16]  So you could put a dead pixel on your house.
[4592.40 --> 4593.94]  You could put a dead pixel on the bumper.
[4593.94 --> 4595.66]  each one of these stickers is a pixel.
[4595.84 --> 4596.02]  Yep.
[4596.12 --> 4598.34]  You could put a dead pixel on the bumper of your car.
[4598.62 --> 4600.64]  You could put a dead pixel on your water bottle.
[4600.64 --> 4602.20]  You could put it anywhere you want.
[4603.20 --> 4606.06]  We've got the dead pixel desk pad.
[4606.18 --> 4606.82]  Do we take this out?
[4607.20 --> 4607.52]  Uh,
[4607.52 --> 4607.70]  nope,
[4607.74 --> 4608.34]  not necessary.
[4608.70 --> 4610.22]  I think people understand the point.
[4610.40 --> 4611.70]  It's a black mouse pad.
[4612.34 --> 4614.28]  There's a white dead pixel on it somewhere.
[4615.10 --> 4617.00]  I'm told they're all different as well.
[4618.44 --> 4619.62]  That is so cool.
[4619.76 --> 4620.54]  That is really cool.
[4620.60 --> 4620.72]  Wait,
[4620.72 --> 4621.84]  is that true of all of them?
[4621.94 --> 4623.02]  Maybe that's only the shirts.
[4623.14 --> 4623.66]  I don't know.
[4624.08 --> 4625.18]  Don't quote me on that
[4625.18 --> 4626.36]  because I'm pretty sure the enamel pin
[4626.36 --> 4627.38]  is always in the same place.
[4627.84 --> 4628.08]  So,
[4628.36 --> 4628.86]  I don't know.
[4629.00 --> 4630.22]  The dead pixel's on it somewhere.
[4630.22 --> 4631.16]  Maybe they're the same.
[4631.56 --> 4632.72]  Maybe some of them are different.
[4633.10 --> 4633.70]  It's all,
[4633.78 --> 4634.74]  it's all part of the fun.
[4634.98 --> 4635.72]  Considering the enamel pin,
[4635.82 --> 4636.28]  it's like,
[4637.02 --> 4638.30]  it's not part of the paint.
[4638.40 --> 4639.64]  It's actually part of the metal.
[4639.64 --> 4640.08]  I'm pretty sure it's molded.
[4640.08 --> 4640.92]  I think it's molded.
[4641.12 --> 4641.30]  Yeah.
[4641.54 --> 4641.94]  Anyway,
[4642.10 --> 4642.34]  this,
[4642.52 --> 4643.14]  I believe,
[4643.40 --> 4645.98]  was a Sarah Butt brainstorm
[4645.98 --> 4647.68]  a while back.
[4647.74 --> 4648.86]  And I was basically like,
[4649.08 --> 4650.64]  not only do we need to do this,
[4650.96 --> 4653.70]  we need to do so much more of this.
[4654.36 --> 4654.76]  So,
[4654.92 --> 4655.10]  it's,
[4655.20 --> 4655.58]  man,
[4655.66 --> 4655.80]  yeah,
[4655.88 --> 4658.10]  we ended up with an entire collection.
[4658.10 --> 4658.36]  So,
[4658.36 --> 4659.28]  you guys can check it out
[4659.28 --> 4660.26]  by clicking it there.
[4660.96 --> 4661.44]  Sticker sheet.
[4661.52 --> 4662.14]  Did I miss anything?
[4662.24 --> 4662.38]  Nope,
[4662.42 --> 4663.30]  but you can get a bundle.
[4663.46 --> 4663.58]  Oh,
[4663.58 --> 4663.92]  that's cool.
[4664.02 --> 4664.18]  Okay,
[4664.22 --> 4665.32]  so you can get some bundle savings.
[4665.44 --> 4668.60]  $59.99 for the entire dead pixel collection.
[4668.76 --> 4670.76]  And this is the same quality desk pad
[4670.76 --> 4672.58]  that you guys have come to know and love from us.
[4672.98 --> 4674.24]  Don't take my word for it.
[4674.56 --> 4676.62]  Take the word of all of the people
[4676.62 --> 4679.22]  who have bought our desk pads over the years.
[4679.66 --> 4681.10]  The one that has sold the most
[4681.10 --> 4681.30]  is,
[4681.44 --> 4681.74]  of course,
[4681.84 --> 4683.28]  the Northern Lights design.
[4683.78 --> 4685.96]  And this is a five-star product,
[4686.08 --> 4687.94]  quite literally a five-star product
[4687.94 --> 4689.38]  with thousands of reviews.
[4689.52 --> 4691.20]  We've sold tens and tens of thousands of these.
[4691.54 --> 4691.74]  So,
[4691.80 --> 4693.40]  it's a really great quality pad.
[4693.76 --> 4695.48]  The only problem with it is that,
[4695.56 --> 4695.72]  hey,
[4695.78 --> 4696.72]  if there's a dead pixel,
[4696.94 --> 4698.96]  I'm afraid we will not be accepting a return
[4698.96 --> 4700.16]  on this desk pad.
[4701.62 --> 4704.68]  If it has more than five dead pixels in a cluster,
[4704.96 --> 4707.88]  then I would accept a return for it.
[4707.88 --> 4708.30]  That seems fair.
[4708.30 --> 4708.66]  Yeah,
[4708.78 --> 4709.42]  that seems fair.
[4709.56 --> 4709.94]  There you go.
[4710.06 --> 4710.48]  There's your,
[4710.48 --> 4712.98]  there's your dead pixel right there.
[4713.52 --> 4714.82]  Dofo and Flowplane Chat said,
[4714.96 --> 4716.38]  so last week was a setup?
[4716.92 --> 4717.82]  Right you are.
[4718.02 --> 4718.38]  Yeah.
[4718.70 --> 4720.32]  Very clever of us.
[4720.76 --> 4721.12]  Anyway,
[4721.26 --> 4721.84]  the point is,
[4721.90 --> 4722.54]  I think we've,
[4722.74 --> 4723.10]  so yeah,
[4723.12 --> 4724.54]  if you want to send a merch message,
[4724.60 --> 4726.70]  all you got to do is head to lttstore.com,
[4726.78 --> 4727.74]  add something to your cart.
[4727.74 --> 4728.94]  And when you're in the cart,
[4729.04 --> 4730.54]  you'll get a little pop-up when we're live
[4730.54 --> 4732.00]  to send a merch message.
[4732.06 --> 4733.10]  It'll go to producer Dan.
[4733.56 --> 4733.80]  Hey,
[4733.84 --> 4734.42]  producer Dan,
[4734.54 --> 4736.46]  who will reply to you,
[4736.58 --> 4737.50]  curate it.
[4737.50 --> 4739.06]  For me and Luke to respond to,
[4739.16 --> 4740.74]  or just pop it up at the bottom,
[4740.82 --> 4742.48]  or even forward it to someone else internally
[4742.48 --> 4745.74]  who can get back to you with the answer that you need.
[4746.98 --> 4747.22]  Yeah,
[4747.26 --> 4748.70]  I have one more update on the store.
[4748.78 --> 4750.02]  If you guys are looking for an excuse
[4750.02 --> 4751.32]  to send a merch message today,
[4751.56 --> 4753.44]  today is your last opportunity
[4753.44 --> 4755.68]  to save 20% on the backpack.
[4755.68 --> 4757.42]  We are taking back orders
[4757.42 --> 4758.62]  for our first batch
[4758.62 --> 4760.84]  of the fully updated backpacks
[4760.84 --> 4762.36]  with the dual layer bottom
[4762.36 --> 4763.74]  and the titanium carabiner.
[4764.30 --> 4765.26]  And YouTube shopping
[4765.26 --> 4767.10]  is helping you save 20%
[4767.10 --> 4768.96]  if you shop the real deal
[4768.96 --> 4770.90]  and purchase through the product tag
[4770.90 --> 4772.42]  on this video.
[4772.66 --> 4772.94]  On YouTube.
[4773.16 --> 4773.34]  Yeah.
[4773.40 --> 4774.66]  So if it's not there,
[4775.16 --> 4776.36]  we don't have the discount
[4776.36 --> 4778.58]  because YouTube is paying for the discount.
[4779.00 --> 4780.48]  They are covering the discount.
[4780.48 --> 4782.08]  All new backpack orders
[4782.08 --> 4783.52]  are expected to ship in July.
[4783.72 --> 4784.94]  There is a very limited number
[4784.94 --> 4785.90]  of these discounts available.
[4786.06 --> 4787.34]  So if you want to get a deal on the backpack,
[4787.72 --> 4788.28]  grab it now.
[4788.68 --> 4789.06]  Dan,
[4789.46 --> 4792.12]  do you want to throw a couple of merch messages at us
[4792.12 --> 4793.50]  and we can show the people how it works?
[4793.64 --> 4794.12]  Sure thing.
[4794.40 --> 4794.92]  Let's see.
[4794.98 --> 4795.54]  Jacob here.
[4795.72 --> 4796.60]  Dino pins when?
[4797.32 --> 4797.72]  At Luke.
[4797.88 --> 4799.22]  Can you talk about your experience
[4799.22 --> 4799.74]  with Shopify
[4799.74 --> 4801.16]  and your team's process?
[4801.54 --> 4803.38]  As a Shopify developer,
[4803.38 --> 4804.70]  I'd love to hear your thoughts
[4804.70 --> 4807.14]  on not building a custom theme.
[4808.52 --> 4810.40]  On not building a custom theme.
[4812.20 --> 4812.64]  Man.
[4812.80 --> 4813.22]  I mean,
[4813.26 --> 4814.26]  sorry to jump in.
[4814.64 --> 4816.28]  It would be very unlike me to do that
[4816.28 --> 4818.56]  if someone specifically asked Luke a question.
[4818.72 --> 4819.12]  Totally.
[4819.50 --> 4819.92]  Yeah, yeah.
[4821.70 --> 4822.40]  Do it faster.
[4822.40 --> 4823.58]  I don't even think it's an option.
[4824.28 --> 4825.02]  What do you mean?
[4825.12 --> 4827.24]  Like not doing a custom theme.
[4827.68 --> 4828.44]  Like honestly,
[4828.54 --> 4829.64]  we ran into so many limitations.
[4829.64 --> 4830.56]  Well, I'm trying to figure out what they mean
[4830.56 --> 4832.38]  because like our theme is based on
[4832.38 --> 4833.74]  one of the Shopify themes.
[4833.84 --> 4836.94]  So are they saying that that's not doing that?
[4837.10 --> 4838.24]  I think it is doing that
[4838.24 --> 4839.48]  because we've made a lot of modifications.
[4840.10 --> 4840.44]  Yeah.
[4840.58 --> 4843.00]  But it isn't like custom from the ground up.
[4843.10 --> 4844.16]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[4844.66 --> 4845.88]  Yeah, I would say...
[4845.88 --> 4847.94]  I'm not sure how they're defining this.
[4847.96 --> 4848.32]  Got it.
[4848.70 --> 4849.84]  Well, one way or another,
[4849.94 --> 4850.74]  I'll tell you this.
[4850.74 --> 4853.88]  You will run into limitations so fast
[4853.88 --> 4855.58]  if you try to just go bone stock.
[4855.86 --> 4857.18]  Let Shopify work for you.
[4857.48 --> 4858.70]  They're actually great.
[4859.24 --> 4860.72]  There are limitations to it.
[4860.72 --> 4863.34]  You're going to get frustrated sometimes
[4863.34 --> 4866.12]  because there's whatever weird esoteric idea
[4866.12 --> 4866.64]  that you have
[4866.64 --> 4867.90]  that isn't going to work very well
[4867.90 --> 4868.80]  with the Shopify setup.
[4869.00 --> 4869.80]  But in general,
[4870.10 --> 4873.16]  Shopify is this fairly quickly,
[4873.36 --> 4874.84]  considering the size of the company,
[4875.30 --> 4877.24]  constantly marching forward machine
[4877.24 --> 4879.26]  that will improve and develop
[4879.26 --> 4881.10]  your store effectively for you.
[4881.38 --> 4882.40]  So I would highly recommend
[4882.40 --> 4884.02]  to base off one of their themes.
[4884.12 --> 4885.52]  I think the theme that we based off of
[4885.52 --> 4886.46]  is the Dawn theme.
[4886.68 --> 4887.46]  I believe that's it.
[4887.46 --> 4888.40]  That sounds familiar.
[4888.40 --> 4889.98]  And then it's heavily modified.
[4890.12 --> 4891.46]  So pick one of the ones that you like
[4891.46 --> 4892.34]  that are on,
[4892.68 --> 4895.06]  do a very short amount of research
[4895.06 --> 4895.98]  because it doesn't require much
[4895.98 --> 4896.86]  to figure out which ones
[4896.86 --> 4900.74]  are their most forward-facing ones right now.
[4901.10 --> 4901.96]  Pick one of those,
[4902.34 --> 4903.40]  modify it to your liking,
[4903.82 --> 4906.02]  and then as they have the...
[4906.02 --> 4907.36]  I don't remember what they're called,
[4907.52 --> 4908.86]  but it happens like,
[4908.88 --> 4909.28]  I don't know,
[4909.40 --> 4910.24]  twice a year or something,
[4910.34 --> 4911.98]  they have these Shopify events,
[4911.98 --> 4914.68]  and they announce like 10 trillion features.
[4915.14 --> 4916.64]  20% are available now,
[4916.74 --> 4917.76]  80% are going to be available
[4917.76 --> 4919.10]  over the next series of weeks,
[4919.16 --> 4920.30]  months, year, whatever.
[4920.92 --> 4922.56]  And then just integrate those features
[4922.56 --> 4923.44]  and keep moving forward.
[4923.62 --> 4925.90]  And then check out the App Store.
[4926.84 --> 4930.22]  They also do like a Shopify-approved apps thing
[4930.22 --> 4931.72]  where there's apps that have worked
[4931.72 --> 4932.64]  more directly with Shopify.
[4932.78 --> 4933.64]  Those ones are often better.
[4933.82 --> 4937.32]  Like, we work with a lot of different companies
[4937.32 --> 4938.14]  in this realm.
[4938.32 --> 4940.62]  Shopify, I would probably say,
[4940.62 --> 4941.86]  is one of the best ones,
[4942.58 --> 4943.76]  considering what they do
[4943.76 --> 4945.16]  and how easy it is to work with them.
[4945.24 --> 4945.38]  Yep.
[4945.44 --> 4947.02]  And considering how little you pay,
[4947.12 --> 4948.88]  especially when your volume is pretty low.
[4949.56 --> 4951.42]  Once you get into them
[4951.42 --> 4953.00]  taking a percentage of your revenue,
[4953.50 --> 4955.10]  then they end up definitely...
[4955.10 --> 4956.28]  Like, they make money on us.
[4956.42 --> 4956.76]  Oh, yeah.
[4956.86 --> 4957.62]  But...
[4958.26 --> 4959.30]  They do a lot of work.
[4959.32 --> 4961.34]  We don't exist without them.
[4961.48 --> 4963.16]  And hiring a development team
[4963.16 --> 4964.16]  to do all the things
[4964.16 --> 4965.30]  that Shopify does for us,
[4965.38 --> 4967.66]  we don't want to.
[4967.84 --> 4968.06]  Yeah.
[4968.50 --> 4968.72]  There.
[4968.72 --> 4970.60]  That's the...
[4970.60 --> 4971.40]  It's not efficient.
[4971.74 --> 4972.02]  Yes.
[4972.94 --> 4973.54]  We'd be better off...
[4973.54 --> 4974.50]  They actually do a lot.
[4974.58 --> 4976.58]  We'd be better off making modifications
[4976.58 --> 4978.10]  to Shopify
[4978.10 --> 4980.74]  than just trying to build our own thing from scratch.
[4980.80 --> 4981.46]  And you've got to consider,
[4981.56 --> 4984.60]  like, if you look at the service
[4984.60 --> 4986.42]  in a really, really simplified vacuum,
[4986.42 --> 4987.40]  it doesn't seem that hard.
[4987.80 --> 4989.88]  And then you start looking through their dashboards.
[4990.08 --> 4990.32]  Yeah.
[4990.48 --> 4992.64]  And then you start looking deeper in their dashboards.
[4992.80 --> 4993.02]  Look.
[4993.10 --> 4994.06]  And then it's like...
[4994.06 --> 4997.58]  As someone who worked for an online retailer
[4997.58 --> 4999.10]  who didn't use Shopify,
[4999.54 --> 5001.12]  I will tell you...
[5001.12 --> 5003.82]  It's not better.
[5004.48 --> 5004.70]  Yeah.
[5005.98 --> 5006.76]  Tortuga said,
[5006.96 --> 5008.56]  have to be careful with apps.
[5009.30 --> 5010.10]  It can get expensive,
[5010.10 --> 5012.02]  so only use what you need while you grow.
[5012.38 --> 5012.90]  I agree,
[5013.04 --> 5013.84]  but some of the apps
[5013.84 --> 5015.56]  are also just, like, straight up free.
[5015.88 --> 5016.02]  Yeah.
[5016.18 --> 5018.12]  Or genuinely very low cost.
[5018.22 --> 5021.04]  And if you look at the pricing model that they have,
[5021.06 --> 5021.78]  you can kind of figure out
[5021.78 --> 5023.12]  how expensive it's going to be.
[5023.12 --> 5025.20]  I personally find a lot of the apps
[5025.20 --> 5026.62]  to be actually quite affordable
[5026.62 --> 5027.66]  for what they offer.
[5028.78 --> 5030.02]  That's easy for us to say, though,
[5030.06 --> 5033.74]  as a store that has got revenue every day.
[5033.88 --> 5034.68]  No, like, genuinely.
[5034.90 --> 5035.16]  I know.
[5035.42 --> 5037.72]  But look, if you're just starting out,
[5038.06 --> 5039.24]  then I can definitely see
[5039.24 --> 5040.40]  how you could end up in a trap
[5040.40 --> 5040.82]  where you go,
[5040.90 --> 5042.32]  oh, well, I can't possibly have a site
[5042.32 --> 5044.48]  without this and this and this.
[5044.52 --> 5046.04]  That's almost certainly not true.
[5046.26 --> 5046.68]  And you're underwater.
[5046.98 --> 5047.16]  Yeah.
[5047.44 --> 5048.84]  You can start with no apps
[5048.84 --> 5049.96]  and you'll be completely fine.
[5050.54 --> 5052.24]  Because if you're a store
[5052.24 --> 5053.26]  that's just barely starting out,
[5053.28 --> 5054.08]  you probably don't need
[5054.08 --> 5055.78]  some of the fancier things
[5055.78 --> 5056.66]  that you can do with apps.
[5056.84 --> 5058.30]  Just wait until you need it.
[5058.34 --> 5058.78]  Get it later.
[5058.98 --> 5060.54]  But yeah, it's good.
[5060.62 --> 5061.02]  It's very good.
[5061.14 --> 5061.82]  Speaking of things
[5061.82 --> 5062.50]  that there's no way
[5062.50 --> 5063.72]  that you can wait until you need,
[5063.82 --> 5064.88]  I am about to drive
[5064.88 --> 5066.18]  probably somewhere in the neighborhood
[5066.18 --> 5068.46]  of 300 to 500 float plane subscribers.
[5068.96 --> 5069.76]  Oh, whoa, why?
[5069.86 --> 5070.68]  Do you know how I'm going to do it?
[5070.74 --> 5070.94]  No.
[5070.94 --> 5072.92]  I'm going to tell everyone
[5072.92 --> 5076.94]  that the legendary 100% success rate
[5076.94 --> 5079.16]  chicken recipe is up.
[5079.96 --> 5080.80]  That's right.
[5081.02 --> 5084.00]  Luke made the 100% success chicken
[5084.00 --> 5085.30]  for Artie,
[5085.62 --> 5088.36]  who said it's pretty good.
[5088.62 --> 5088.86]  Yeah.
[5089.20 --> 5090.42]  He also did a video
[5090.42 --> 5091.66]  showing off his burbs.
[5091.84 --> 5093.54]  It was Luke week on float plane.
[5093.66 --> 5095.98]  So the exclusives were all Luke themed.
[5096.18 --> 5097.82]  Actually, not all Luke themed.
[5097.82 --> 5100.18]  We've also got Emily's video
[5100.18 --> 5101.58]  taking a deeper dive
[5101.58 --> 5103.42]  into the prototype via Centaur
[5103.42 --> 5104.76]  AI accelerated CPU.
[5105.46 --> 5106.98]  And I think this is from last week.
[5107.04 --> 5109.14]  So it's mostly, mostly Luke themed,
[5109.24 --> 5110.54]  but he also did his Starfield
[5110.54 --> 5113.16]  slash gaming industry rant
[5113.16 --> 5115.52]  slash optimistic chat.
[5115.86 --> 5117.04]  Wait, have you watched it?
[5117.20 --> 5118.08]  How did you know that?
[5118.58 --> 5119.78]  Well, because I don't need
[5119.78 --> 5121.62]  to watch a video you host.
[5121.70 --> 5122.84]  I know exactly what you're going to say.
[5125.02 --> 5125.92]  That's pretty funny
[5125.92 --> 5126.42]  because I was like,
[5126.48 --> 5127.52]  there's, I feel like
[5127.52 --> 5128.58]  there's no way he watched it,
[5128.62 --> 5131.86]  but then you accurately described it
[5131.86 --> 5133.14]  better than like anyone else has.
[5133.16 --> 5133.42]  So I was like,
[5133.44 --> 5134.32]  how does this make any sense?
[5134.52 --> 5135.36]  Also, I read comments.
[5135.52 --> 5135.82]  One of the,
[5135.88 --> 5137.18]  one of the funny things on it,
[5137.20 --> 5137.72]  that makes sense.
[5137.98 --> 5139.26]  One of the funny things on that
[5139.26 --> 5140.88]  is, you know,
[5141.18 --> 5142.46]  haven't wrote a video
[5142.46 --> 5144.18]  in six or seven years.
[5144.22 --> 5144.52]  Oh yeah.
[5144.52 --> 5145.30]  I thought it was going to be
[5145.30 --> 5146.24]  like nine minutes long.
[5147.44 --> 5148.18]  Four minutes.
[5148.44 --> 5148.80]  Oh wow.
[5148.86 --> 5149.68]  Very fast.
[5149.86 --> 5151.18]  Man, that's amazing.
[5151.52 --> 5153.44]  Get Luke to talk about Starfield
[5153.44 --> 5154.68]  and the gaming industry
[5154.68 --> 5155.88]  and he wraps it up
[5155.88 --> 5157.66]  in four minutes and 11 seconds.
[5158.28 --> 5159.78]  Have him talk about his birds
[5159.78 --> 5161.58]  and it takes him 20 minutes.
[5161.78 --> 5162.62]  And there's an extra
[5162.62 --> 5164.48]  like minute and a half long clip
[5164.48 --> 5165.48]  that I added at the end.
[5165.90 --> 5166.74]  That's hilarious.
[5167.32 --> 5167.50]  Yeah.
[5167.62 --> 5168.60]  And, oh yeah,
[5168.64 --> 5169.06]  and chicken.
[5169.20 --> 5170.52]  Chicken also takes 20 minutes.
[5170.52 --> 5171.04]  So I made,
[5171.18 --> 5172.72]  the Starfield video was longer.
[5172.84 --> 5173.58]  I made it shorter
[5173.58 --> 5174.72]  because I thought it was too long.
[5174.88 --> 5176.04]  I think what got me
[5176.04 --> 5177.90]  was I mentally compared it
[5177.90 --> 5179.26]  to how long the documents were
[5179.26 --> 5180.22]  that I would write for scripts
[5180.22 --> 5180.92]  back in the day.
[5181.14 --> 5181.34]  Yeah.
[5181.34 --> 5182.10]  And I think like,
[5182.16 --> 5182.52]  I don't know,
[5182.64 --> 5183.82]  font or format or something
[5183.82 --> 5184.66]  must have been different.
[5184.92 --> 5186.02]  Like paragraph spacing
[5186.02 --> 5186.90]  or font or something.
[5187.12 --> 5188.12]  So it ended up being
[5188.12 --> 5189.08]  like half as long.
[5189.18 --> 5189.58]  That's hilarious.
[5189.58 --> 5190.08]  Because it was like
[5190.08 --> 5191.06]  a page and a half.
[5191.42 --> 5191.88]  It's like,
[5191.92 --> 5192.86]  how the heck did it come out
[5192.86 --> 5194.84]  to four minutes and 11 seconds?
[5195.02 --> 5197.38]  I think it has some good content in it,
[5197.50 --> 5198.78]  but I don't know.
[5199.04 --> 5200.62]  Nickelplane asking the big questions.
[5200.86 --> 5201.98]  What do your birds think
[5201.98 --> 5203.40]  of you cooking other birds?
[5207.46 --> 5208.50]  They don't seem to mind.
[5208.62 --> 5210.02]  I eat chicken in front of them.
[5210.02 --> 5210.66]  Yeah, okay.
[5210.78 --> 5211.60]  And that doesn't bother them?
[5211.84 --> 5212.88]  Effectively every day.
[5213.12 --> 5213.48]  Okay.
[5213.78 --> 5214.14]  All right.
[5214.54 --> 5215.24]  Don't seem to care.
[5215.74 --> 5216.68]  What if you ate like
[5216.68 --> 5218.30]  something more closely related?
[5218.40 --> 5219.42]  What if you ate a cockatiel
[5219.42 --> 5220.02]  in front of them?
[5220.46 --> 5222.10]  That might be a bit of an issue.
[5223.08 --> 5224.60]  I might not go over super well.
[5224.60 --> 5224.68]  What if you ate it raw?
[5225.78 --> 5226.14]  Wow.
[5226.24 --> 5226.70]  Like would that,
[5226.80 --> 5227.66]  would they recognize
[5227.66 --> 5229.50]  like he is eating a bird?
[5229.60 --> 5230.18]  I think so.
[5230.32 --> 5230.82]  You think so?
[5230.84 --> 5231.36]  They're pretty,
[5231.58 --> 5232.32]  are they that smart?
[5232.40 --> 5233.64]  Like if you ate a budgie,
[5234.02 --> 5235.62]  if you Ozzy Osbourne'd a budgie,
[5235.72 --> 5236.62]  I think they would be
[5236.62 --> 5237.14]  right in front of them.
[5237.16 --> 5237.86]  Pretty upset.
[5238.02 --> 5238.22]  Yeah.
[5238.22 --> 5239.54]  I think that would be pretty terrible.
[5239.54 --> 5240.40]  Dan got the reference.
[5241.18 --> 5241.52]  I know.
[5241.66 --> 5241.94]  I know.
[5242.12 --> 5242.38]  Yeah.
[5242.58 --> 5242.80]  Yeah.
[5242.80 --> 5243.22]  I just mean,
[5243.32 --> 5244.82]  was that actually real?
[5244.92 --> 5245.96]  Did that like actually happen?
[5245.98 --> 5246.20]  Oh yeah.
[5246.30 --> 5246.84]  The bat?
[5246.98 --> 5247.34]  Oh yeah.
[5249.34 --> 5249.70]  Guys,
[5249.80 --> 5250.04]  guys,
[5250.04 --> 5250.06]  guys,
[5250.14 --> 5250.78]  a whack job.
[5251.48 --> 5251.84]  Guys,
[5251.90 --> 5252.64]  a whack job.
[5253.40 --> 5254.10]  That's wild.
[5255.12 --> 5255.48]  Yeah.
[5255.58 --> 5255.76]  Some,
[5255.88 --> 5256.54]  some people are asking
[5256.54 --> 5257.74]  for a state of gaming part two.
[5257.88 --> 5258.32]  I don't know.
[5258.40 --> 5259.50]  I feel like I kind of like
[5259.50 --> 5260.60]  owe people another one,
[5260.68 --> 5261.28]  but I can't do it
[5261.28 --> 5262.12]  on the same topic
[5262.12 --> 5264.02]  because I made that one
[5264.02 --> 5264.78]  really dense,
[5264.82 --> 5265.22]  I guess,
[5265.22 --> 5267.08]  but it has basically
[5267.08 --> 5267.86]  everything in it.
[5267.94 --> 5269.26]  Like the video is actually fine
[5269.26 --> 5270.32]  being as long as it is.
[5270.50 --> 5271.74]  It just doesn't have any filler.
[5273.08 --> 5273.48]  Oh,
[5273.70 --> 5275.48]  apparently Ozzy thought
[5275.48 --> 5276.36]  it was a prop,
[5276.48 --> 5277.92]  but he was like
[5277.92 --> 5279.18]  so ripped out of his skull
[5279.18 --> 5279.74]  on drugs
[5279.74 --> 5280.58]  that he didn't notice
[5280.58 --> 5281.84]  they handed him a live one.
[5282.22 --> 5282.62]  Wow.
[5283.54 --> 5284.80]  That's kind of brutal actually.
[5285.02 --> 5285.90]  We've all been there.
[5286.10 --> 5286.96]  Pretty gross.
[5287.36 --> 5289.22]  So that's where COVID came from.
[5289.22 --> 5289.58]  Yeah.
[5290.36 --> 5291.54]  It's just a little delayed.
[5292.04 --> 5292.20]  Yeah.
[5292.20 --> 5296.40]  It was just,
[5296.48 --> 5297.78]  it was just quarantined
[5297.78 --> 5298.46]  in his system
[5298.46 --> 5299.60]  by like all the other
[5299.60 --> 5300.90]  wild things going on
[5300.90 --> 5302.62]  in there for 25 years
[5302.62 --> 5303.76]  or however long it was.
[5303.86 --> 5304.68]  There was some jokes
[5304.68 --> 5306.14]  that of the Luke Week
[5306.14 --> 5307.06]  exclusive content,
[5307.26 --> 5309.34]  there was four minutes
[5309.34 --> 5310.04]  of video games
[5310.04 --> 5312.10]  and 40 minutes of birds.
[5312.44 --> 5312.80]  Yeah.
[5312.96 --> 5313.72]  Because of chicken
[5313.72 --> 5315.28]  and budgies.
[5315.48 --> 5315.72]  I mean,
[5315.72 --> 5316.64]  that makes perfect sense.
[5317.26 --> 5317.92]  All right.
[5318.06 --> 5318.40]  Anyway,
[5318.54 --> 5318.70]  yeah.
[5318.78 --> 5319.58]  Good week on float plane.
[5319.66 --> 5319.76]  Okay.
[5319.80 --> 5319.98]  Dan,
[5320.04 --> 5320.36]  want to hit us
[5320.36 --> 5321.26]  with another merch message?
[5321.46 --> 5321.60]  Sure.
[5321.60 --> 5322.56]  Good evening,
[5322.72 --> 5323.18]  LLD.
[5323.46 --> 5324.06]  I was interested
[5324.06 --> 5325.32]  in the duvet
[5325.32 --> 5326.34]  that was briefly talked
[5326.34 --> 5327.58]  about a yearish ago.
[5327.72 --> 5328.34]  Any updates
[5328.34 --> 5329.50]  or has it been crushed?
[5330.44 --> 5330.84]  Dead.
[5331.36 --> 5331.56]  Yeah.
[5331.76 --> 5333.14]  We actually still have
[5333.14 --> 5334.82]  literally $100,000
[5334.82 --> 5335.90]  in alpaca wool.
[5336.02 --> 5336.76]  I heard about this.
[5336.86 --> 5337.10]  Yeah.
[5337.26 --> 5339.02]  So we do need to find
[5339.02 --> 5339.86]  something to do with it.
[5339.86 --> 5340.58]  Anyone has any bright ideas?
[5340.70 --> 5340.86]  Yeah.
[5341.22 --> 5342.56]  Do you want an alpaca
[5342.56 --> 5343.14]  something?
[5343.20 --> 5343.40]  I mean,
[5343.40 --> 5344.04]  maybe we should just
[5344.04 --> 5345.72]  make a life-size alpaca plush
[5345.72 --> 5346.58]  and then just stuff it
[5346.58 --> 5347.40]  with alpaca wool
[5347.40 --> 5348.22]  and call it a day.
[5348.36 --> 5349.62]  We did Merino underwear.
[5349.88 --> 5351.02]  What about alpaca underwear?
[5351.02 --> 5351.32]  Well,
[5351.44 --> 5352.34]  the problem is that
[5352.34 --> 5353.08]  it's loose wool
[5353.08 --> 5353.80]  because it was meant
[5353.80 --> 5355.00]  to be used as pillow stuffing
[5355.00 --> 5355.84]  so we would actually
[5355.84 --> 5356.82]  have to get it like...
[5356.82 --> 5357.62]  We'd have to like machine it?
[5357.80 --> 5358.16]  Yeah,
[5358.24 --> 5359.10]  we'd have to get it,
[5359.20 --> 5360.16]  I don't know,
[5360.24 --> 5360.66]  yarned.
[5360.66 --> 5361.22]  Turned into...
[5361.22 --> 5363.32]  Whatever the weaving
[5363.32 --> 5364.08]  or process
[5364.08 --> 5364.74]  or whatever that is.
[5364.74 --> 5366.38]  What if you made like whale plushies
[5366.38 --> 5367.22]  and then just made them
[5367.22 --> 5368.00]  incredibly expensive
[5368.00 --> 5368.80]  because they're filled
[5368.80 --> 5369.58]  with alpaca wool?
[5369.70 --> 5370.04]  I mean,
[5370.14 --> 5371.66]  it's a possibility.
[5371.94 --> 5372.04]  Yeah,
[5372.04 --> 5372.84]  we could do whale plushies.
[5372.92 --> 5374.66]  We could do a bread
[5374.66 --> 5375.56]  sorus plushie
[5375.56 --> 5376.12]  and just...
[5376.12 --> 5376.38]  Yeah,
[5376.44 --> 5376.66]  it's like,
[5376.72 --> 5376.90]  sorry,
[5376.98 --> 5377.48]  it's $100
[5377.48 --> 5378.32]  because it's full
[5378.32 --> 5379.04]  of alpaca wool
[5379.04 --> 5381.16]  and also it smells
[5381.16 --> 5382.28]  for the first three days
[5382.28 --> 5383.84]  because it's full
[5383.84 --> 5384.74]  of alpaca wool.
[5384.88 --> 5384.94]  Like,
[5385.00 --> 5385.72]  I don't know.
[5386.18 --> 5386.54]  I don't know
[5386.54 --> 5387.54]  what to do with it.
[5389.32 --> 5390.96]  Alpaca edition screwdriver
[5390.96 --> 5392.14]  just comes what,
[5392.26 --> 5392.46]  like,
[5392.58 --> 5393.86]  with just like
[5393.86 --> 5395.28]  a bushel of alpaca wool
[5395.28 --> 5395.92]  in the box.
[5396.02 --> 5396.16]  Like,
[5396.18 --> 5396.82]  I don't know.
[5397.70 --> 5398.10]  Yeah,
[5398.10 --> 5400.00]  it's just premium packaging.
[5400.14 --> 5400.46]  It doesn't make
[5400.46 --> 5401.16]  the screwdriver better
[5401.16 --> 5401.72]  in any way.
[5401.80 --> 5401.92]  Yeah,
[5401.92 --> 5402.36]  we've had it
[5402.36 --> 5403.32]  for like three years.
[5403.42 --> 5403.68]  Apparently,
[5403.76 --> 5404.26]  it's been stored
[5404.26 --> 5404.92]  in a dry place
[5404.92 --> 5405.56]  so it's like,
[5405.72 --> 5406.12]  fine.
[5406.20 --> 5406.92]  It should be fine
[5406.92 --> 5408.78]  but we do really need
[5408.78 --> 5409.98]  to just put something
[5409.98 --> 5410.34]  in it.
[5410.34 --> 5410.54]  Are you paying storage on that?
[5411.16 --> 5411.56]  Apparently,
[5411.78 --> 5412.14]  somehow,
[5412.34 --> 5412.64]  no.
[5413.56 --> 5413.86]  Yeah,
[5413.96 --> 5415.58]  which surprised me a lot
[5415.58 --> 5417.48]  because I don't know
[5417.48 --> 5418.58]  how much it costs.
[5418.70 --> 5418.84]  Like,
[5418.86 --> 5420.10]  I don't know how much wool
[5420.10 --> 5420.66]  that is.
[5420.82 --> 5420.98]  Yeah.
[5421.06 --> 5421.76]  But that sounds like
[5421.76 --> 5422.84]  a lot of money to me
[5422.84 --> 5423.98]  and so,
[5425.02 --> 5425.12]  like,
[5425.36 --> 5426.22]  has alpaca wool
[5426.22 --> 5427.42]  gone up in value?
[5427.56 --> 5427.68]  Like,
[5427.72 --> 5429.02]  is this an appreciating asset?
[5429.32 --> 5429.50]  Yeah,
[5429.56 --> 5430.36]  are you just trading
[5430.36 --> 5430.90]  commodities?
[5433.70 --> 5434.76]  Is this one of my
[5434.76 --> 5436.18]  largest personal investments?
[5436.56 --> 5437.66]  Do I need to disclose
[5437.66 --> 5438.26]  this shit?
[5438.94 --> 5440.16]  Move over gold.
[5440.36 --> 5442.34]  We've got animal.
[5443.48 --> 5444.12]  We're going to put
[5444.12 --> 5445.56]  option puts on alpaca.
[5445.58 --> 5449.10]  Alpaca fiber market.
[5449.12 --> 5449.26]  Oh,
[5449.36 --> 5449.52]  no.
[5450.40 --> 5450.86]  Hold on,
[5450.92 --> 5451.12]  I'm just,
[5451.12 --> 5451.86]  I'm just checking.
[5452.00 --> 5452.34]  What are the,
[5452.40 --> 5453.22]  what are the trends?
[5454.22 --> 5455.20]  Increasing popularity
[5455.20 --> 5457.00]  in the fashion apparel industry.
[5457.22 --> 5458.24]  We've got pork futures.
[5458.50 --> 5458.78]  That's a good,
[5458.86 --> 5459.80]  that's a good one for you.
[5459.86 --> 5460.48]  This is crazy.
[5460.62 --> 5461.64]  Show me a graph.
[5461.80 --> 5462.52]  Show me a graph.
[5462.60 --> 5463.02]  I need a graph.
[5463.04 --> 5464.10]  Someone needs to short
[5464.10 --> 5465.54]  Linus's alpaca wool.
[5466.98 --> 5468.08]  Not financial advice.
[5468.96 --> 5470.06]  Gamma squeeze it.
[5471.06 --> 5471.46]  Okay,
[5471.50 --> 5472.16]  you don't have to spam
[5472.16 --> 5472.48]  that much.
[5472.56 --> 5472.74]  Relax.
[5473.24 --> 5473.64]  Um,
[5474.42 --> 5476.14]  I don't want an alpaca wool hat.
[5476.38 --> 5476.54]  No,
[5476.66 --> 5477.46]  I don't think I need it.
[5477.46 --> 5478.24]  I don't know if anyone wants that.
[5478.34 --> 5478.62]  Okay,
[5478.78 --> 5479.28]  here's the,
[5479.34 --> 5480.60]  here's the market size.
[5481.06 --> 5481.46]  Um,
[5481.56 --> 5482.62]  I don't know what we have,
[5482.68 --> 5483.70]  but I suspect it's somewhere
[5483.70 --> 5485.68]  in the medium range.
[5485.68 --> 5486.46]  I don't think it's,
[5486.46 --> 5486.76]  uh,
[5486.76 --> 5488.86]  particularly fine fibers.
[5489.28 --> 5489.64]  Uh,
[5489.64 --> 5489.94]  where's,
[5490.00 --> 5490.74]  show me the price.
[5490.84 --> 5492.10]  Show me the bloody price.
[5492.10 --> 5492.34]  Okay,
[5492.38 --> 5493.02]  I give up.
[5493.10 --> 5494.06]  That was as much time
[5494.06 --> 5494.98]  as I'm willing to invest
[5494.98 --> 5495.78]  into that right now.
[5499.26 --> 5499.86]  All right,
[5499.92 --> 5500.14]  hit me,
[5500.22 --> 5500.34]  Dan.
[5501.00 --> 5501.20]  Hey,
[5501.36 --> 5501.84]  WAN crew,
[5502.00 --> 5502.64]  I'm in the process
[5502.64 --> 5504.42]  of joining the U.S. Navy
[5504.42 --> 5506.94]  to be a cyber warfare technician.
[5507.40 --> 5508.92]  Did y'all ever think about
[5508.92 --> 5510.98]  doing some kind of cyber tech work
[5510.98 --> 5512.12]  in the military
[5512.12 --> 5513.06]  or government space?
[5513.32 --> 5513.78]  Big fan.
[5514.46 --> 5515.54]  I think I've thought about
[5515.54 --> 5516.40]  doing everything
[5516.40 --> 5517.94]  one could imagine.
[5518.28 --> 5518.64]  Um,
[5518.64 --> 5519.72]  so I don't know how fair it is
[5519.72 --> 5521.04]  to say how'd you end up here?
[5522.54 --> 5523.42]  Mostly accident.
[5525.50 --> 5527.26]  I was just like up late
[5527.26 --> 5528.14]  and saw this video
[5528.14 --> 5528.58]  and was like,
[5528.62 --> 5528.74]  oh,
[5528.80 --> 5529.30]  I'll do that.
[5529.78 --> 5529.96]  Let me,
[5530.02 --> 5530.66]  let me put my,
[5530.66 --> 5530.98]  uh,
[5530.98 --> 5532.14]  computer on this railway.
[5535.30 --> 5536.66]  You tell me how that works,
[5536.72 --> 5536.88]  man.
[5537.36 --> 5537.76]  Um,
[5538.14 --> 5538.68]  uh,
[5538.96 --> 5540.08]  yeah,
[5540.12 --> 5540.52]  I don't know.
[5540.68 --> 5540.92]  It's,
[5540.92 --> 5541.76]  it's like sounds,
[5541.88 --> 5542.08]  I think,
[5542.16 --> 5543.06]  I think for a lot of people,
[5543.18 --> 5543.84]  myself included,
[5544.16 --> 5545.44]  it sounds really cool.
[5545.44 --> 5546.84]  And then you start doing stuff
[5546.84 --> 5547.40]  in that space
[5547.40 --> 5547.76]  and you're like,
[5547.88 --> 5548.24]  whoa,
[5548.28 --> 5549.38]  this is really hard.
[5549.72 --> 5550.10]  Uh,
[5550.14 --> 5550.38]  right.
[5551.62 --> 5552.02]  So,
[5552.72 --> 5553.28]  yeah.
[5553.48 --> 5554.16]  As for me,
[5554.70 --> 5555.06]  no,
[5555.22 --> 5555.48]  no,
[5555.64 --> 5558.86]  I just really like computers.
[5559.48 --> 5559.92]  Yep.
[5560.82 --> 5561.24]  And,
[5561.36 --> 5561.72]  uh,
[5561.72 --> 5562.04]  my,
[5562.28 --> 5563.26]  my career path
[5563.26 --> 5564.70]  had already diverged.
[5564.80 --> 5565.14]  They,
[5565.20 --> 5566.38]  they wouldn't let me be a technician
[5566.38 --> 5567.10]  at NCIX.
[5567.26 --> 5568.06]  Did I ever tell you that?
[5568.76 --> 5569.16]  No.
[5569.76 --> 5571.04]  So it wasn't because
[5571.04 --> 5572.04]  of lack of certification
[5572.04 --> 5572.94]  or anything like that.
[5572.94 --> 5573.30]  It was,
[5573.38 --> 5573.48]  I,
[5573.48 --> 5575.26]  I wasn't the most experienced
[5575.26 --> 5575.86]  and that's fine.
[5575.92 --> 5576.92]  I could see how they could be
[5576.92 --> 5578.24]  concerned about the optics of that,
[5578.24 --> 5579.08]  but it had nothing to do
[5579.08 --> 5579.78]  with skill level.
[5580.40 --> 5580.70]  Um,
[5580.78 --> 5582.08]  I was just too good at selling.
[5582.54 --> 5582.86]  Oh,
[5583.02 --> 5583.98]  they wanted me in the front.
[5584.12 --> 5584.74]  I was like,
[5584.80 --> 5585.28]  I,
[5585.28 --> 5586.08]  I would like to,
[5586.16 --> 5587.26]  I would like to just work in the back.
[5587.30 --> 5587.82]  So I would just,
[5588.10 --> 5589.18]  I would just hang out in the back
[5589.18 --> 5589.92]  and talk to the,
[5590.04 --> 5591.32]  to the tech at the Langley store.
[5591.38 --> 5592.02]  His name was Andrew.
[5592.10 --> 5592.60]  He was sick.
[5593.16 --> 5593.26]  Yeah.
[5593.26 --> 5593.96]  Guy was awesome.
[5594.08 --> 5594.52]  He was like,
[5594.88 --> 5595.72]  he was one of those guys
[5595.72 --> 5596.66]  that just like,
[5597.22 --> 5597.70]  well,
[5598.10 --> 5599.36]  computer tech,
[5599.62 --> 5600.94]  just zero f***s given.
[5601.42 --> 5601.62]  Uh,
[5601.62 --> 5602.90]  I think I remember this dude.
[5602.90 --> 5603.06]  Yeah.
[5603.06 --> 5603.82]  Super nice guy.
[5604.38 --> 5604.74]  Um,
[5605.54 --> 5606.34]  he's kind of ginger.
[5607.22 --> 5607.38]  I,
[5607.54 --> 5608.16]  I recall correctly.
[5608.56 --> 5609.12]  I hardly,
[5609.48 --> 5612.38]  so I didn't require his services,
[5612.38 --> 5614.30]  but I would like stand there waiting
[5614.30 --> 5615.24]  to pick up one of my orders
[5615.24 --> 5615.58]  or whatever.
[5615.58 --> 5616.40]  And the techs would come out
[5616.40 --> 5617.06]  and work with people.
[5617.06 --> 5618.22]  And I remember just like listening in.
[5618.30 --> 5618.40]  Yeah.
[5618.42 --> 5618.88]  But he was chill.
[5618.98 --> 5619.38]  He was awesome.
[5619.72 --> 5620.00]  Uh,
[5620.00 --> 5620.32]  anyway,
[5620.48 --> 5620.66]  yeah,
[5620.66 --> 5621.18]  they wouldn't,
[5621.22 --> 5621.42]  uh,
[5621.42 --> 5621.56]  they,
[5621.68 --> 5621.86]  they,
[5621.86 --> 5622.00]  they,
[5622.00 --> 5623.62]  they wouldn't let me just,
[5623.70 --> 5625.08]  so I'd go back there and hang out with them.
[5625.10 --> 5627.10]  And the only reason that no one would get mad at me for it
[5627.10 --> 5629.58]  was cause like my sales were higher than anyone else in the store
[5629.58 --> 5629.98]  anyway,
[5629.98 --> 5631.54]  in spite of the fact that I was just like
[5631.54 --> 5633.16]  shooting the breeze with the technician
[5633.16 --> 5635.32]  a lot of the time.
[5636.36 --> 5637.38]  Cause realistically,
[5637.38 --> 5637.68]  I,
[5637.86 --> 5639.76]  everything I was talking about was kind of on task,
[5639.80 --> 5640.04]  right?
[5640.18 --> 5641.10]  Like honestly,
[5641.24 --> 5643.04]  how much better would Best Buy be?
[5643.74 --> 5644.14]  Okay.
[5644.14 --> 5645.38]  Let's not use Best Buy as an example.
[5645.58 --> 5648.18]  How much better would your local computer store be
[5648.18 --> 5650.70]  if the sales reps spent a 10th of their time
[5650.70 --> 5651.82]  just talking to the technicians?
[5655.44 --> 5655.84]  Yeah.
[5656.10 --> 5656.32]  Yeah,
[5656.40 --> 5656.82]  probably.
[5657.28 --> 5657.66]  I mean,
[5657.72 --> 5658.14]  the,
[5658.14 --> 5658.70]  the,
[5658.86 --> 5660.94]  I'm going to use Best Buy anyways.
[5660.94 --> 5662.88]  The Best Buy that I used to work at,
[5663.18 --> 5666.28]  our computer sales crew and our Geek Squad crew,
[5666.28 --> 5666.98]  when I worked there,
[5667.02 --> 5669.98]  were actually pretty well linked and we did super well.
[5670.86 --> 5672.32]  And I think it made sense.
[5672.60 --> 5672.74]  Yeah.
[5672.74 --> 5674.04]  Cause our team was like all quite competent.
[5674.22 --> 5674.36]  No,
[5674.42 --> 5674.62]  it makes,
[5674.68 --> 5676.24]  it makes a ton of sense because otherwise,
[5676.34 --> 5678.72]  how are you going to know what to sell unless you know what comes back?
[5679.02 --> 5679.24]  Yeah.
[5679.88 --> 5680.20]  Our,
[5680.20 --> 5682.52]  our store was like one of the worst in Canada or something.
[5682.58 --> 5683.82]  And by the time we were done,
[5683.86 --> 5685.64]  we were like number one or number two in Canada.
[5685.64 --> 5686.44]  And I,
[5686.44 --> 5686.52]  I,
[5686.52 --> 5691.76]  we had a just fairly significant roster change and everybody was just real into it.
[5691.98 --> 5692.38]  And it's,
[5692.44 --> 5695.44]  it's a lot easier to sell things when you like know what you're talking about and are passionate.
[5695.82 --> 5696.22]  Yeah.
[5696.30 --> 5697.28]  Cause most people are like,
[5697.32 --> 5697.58]  okay,
[5697.58 --> 5697.94]  cool.
[5698.06 --> 5698.96]  I hear what you're saying.
[5699.04 --> 5700.28]  Everything that you're saying makes sense.
[5700.42 --> 5705.10]  You have me interested in this thing because listening to passionate people is just interesting for most people.
[5705.22 --> 5705.62]  Exactly.
[5705.80 --> 5706.16]  Um,
[5706.40 --> 5706.60]  yeah,
[5706.72 --> 5707.22]  and it works.
[5707.22 --> 5709.48]  All right.
[5710.56 --> 5712.12]  What do you want to do for a topic?
[5713.58 --> 5714.54]  Do we want to pick a,
[5714.66 --> 5714.80]  Oh,
[5714.88 --> 5715.72]  you want to do sponsors?
[5715.96 --> 5716.26]  Dang it,
[5716.30 --> 5716.46]  Dan.
[5716.52 --> 5716.62]  No,
[5716.64 --> 5717.40]  they deserve a topic.
[5717.52 --> 5718.20]  They should have a topic.
[5718.36 --> 5718.52]  Yeah.
[5719.66 --> 5720.02]  Dan.
[5721.44 --> 5721.76]  Gosh.
[5722.70 --> 5726.40]  How about Meta says no more spam unless it's AI spam.
[5726.52 --> 5726.78]  Okay.
[5726.84 --> 5727.02]  Yeah.
[5727.02 --> 5728.36]  I don't know what the heck's going on with this.
[5728.60 --> 5737.20]  Meta says that they will be changing the recommendation algorithm for Instagram and threads so that they will no longer recommend reposts and ripped off the content.
[5737.20 --> 5741.30]  Which the company says will give more visibility to creators of original content.
[5741.42 --> 5747.78]  And when you listen to people who actually liked Facebook at some point talk about Facebook and its decline,
[5748.06 --> 5749.30]  what they talk about,
[5749.50 --> 5751.46]  I've found more than anything else,
[5751.60 --> 5756.42]  is missing the days when it was actual updates from people they are first,
[5756.58 --> 5761.02]  first order connected to single degree of separation connected to,
[5761.48 --> 5761.82]  um,
[5761.82 --> 5762.14]  and,
[5762.18 --> 5762.38]  and,
[5762.38 --> 5764.14]  and interacting with those people.
[5764.14 --> 5769.94]  And it's just kind of turned into just an endless doom scrolling pile of content farm,
[5770.44 --> 5770.66]  you know,
[5770.78 --> 5774.74]  video crap and reposts of stolen memes and all that kind of stuff.
[5774.86 --> 5775.06]  So,
[5775.58 --> 5775.84]  uh,
[5775.90 --> 5778.86]  I don't see anything in here about Facebook.
[5779.40 --> 5779.56]  Uh,
[5779.56 --> 5779.74]  no.
[5779.84 --> 5779.96]  Okay.
[5779.98 --> 5780.76]  We'll get to that in a second.
[5781.12 --> 5781.28]  Uh,
[5781.28 --> 5786.32]  these platforms will also add labels to reposted content with a link back to the original creator.
[5786.40 --> 5787.40]  That is super cool.
[5787.40 --> 5789.42]  And that should just be kind of standard practice.
[5789.50 --> 5790.12]  I kind of love that.
[5790.78 --> 5794.08]  This will not apply to content that has been significantly altered.
[5794.08 --> 5794.44]  However,
[5794.66 --> 5797.90]  like a work that is edited into a meme or given a new voiceover.
[5798.82 --> 5799.34]  Meanwhile,
[5799.66 --> 5808.30]  it has become significantly harder to find original artist content on Facebook as the platform has become flooded with unmarked AI content,
[5808.30 --> 5811.20]  much of which is bizarrely Jesus themed.
[5812.04 --> 5819.18]  Meta platforms are likewise being flooded with tons of ads for NSFW AI girlfriends against meta's own policies.
[5819.70 --> 5820.52]  According to wired,
[5820.68 --> 5825.50]  at least 29,000 of these sexually suggestive ads have been published on meta platforms.
[5826.16 --> 5826.36]  Uh,
[5826.36 --> 5829.20]  meta's own AI has been acting oddly on Facebook,
[5829.32 --> 5831.78]  making weird unsolicited comments on posts,
[5831.78 --> 5837.78]  including one incident where it commented on a parenting group claiming to have a disabled yet gifted child.
[5838.72 --> 5842.38]  Meta has also added the AI chat bot to Instagram search,
[5842.52 --> 5844.64]  making it difficult to avoid interacting with these features.
[5844.74 --> 5845.86]  I did notice that actually.
[5846.18 --> 5846.54]  Anyway,
[5846.76 --> 5847.32]  I want to,
[5847.36 --> 5851.66]  I just want to show you guys a couple of examples of this weird,
[5851.88 --> 5854.56]  oddly Jesus themed AI artwork.
[5854.96 --> 5855.28]  Uh,
[5855.28 --> 5855.98]  here's one.
[5857.18 --> 5859.04]  Made it with my own hands.
[5859.04 --> 5861.98]  Thanks to everyone who appreciates this.
[5862.08 --> 5863.30]  And this is from account.
[5863.50 --> 5864.92]  Love God and God love you.
[5865.64 --> 5866.56]  What the,
[5867.20 --> 5867.88]  what,
[5868.02 --> 5869.80]  what am I looking at here?
[5869.80 --> 5873.30]  And why does this have 46,000 interactions?
[5873.74 --> 5873.94]  Yeah.
[5874.22 --> 5875.78]  How much of this is bought activity?
[5876.14 --> 5876.98]  46,000 interactions,
[5877.12 --> 5878.20]  but only 500 comments.
[5878.54 --> 5878.78]  Well,
[5878.88 --> 5879.02]  no,
[5879.08 --> 5880.26]  that's an okay ratio.
[5880.72 --> 5881.20]  Yeah.
[5881.26 --> 5883.42]  Cause an interaction on Facebook is so low friction.
[5883.78 --> 5883.98]  Yeah,
[5884.00 --> 5884.56]  I guess this,
[5884.66 --> 5888.00]  this may legitimately be actual people that are like,
[5888.14 --> 5888.38]  yes,
[5888.38 --> 5889.44]  shrimp Jesus.
[5889.94 --> 5890.10]  Well,
[5890.14 --> 5890.86]  the next one,
[5891.78 --> 5894.24]  the next one has 185,000 interactions.
[5894.56 --> 5895.28]  Love from love,
[5895.34 --> 5895.94]  father and mother.
[5896.06 --> 5896.64]  Bless you.
[5897.18 --> 5898.54]  Made it with my own hands.
[5898.64 --> 5900.64]  Thanks to everyone who appreciates this.
[5900.74 --> 5901.32]  They're doing it.
[5901.42 --> 5902.54]  They made it with my own hands thing.
[5902.60 --> 5904.70]  And both of these accounts after the ambersand,
[5904.78 --> 5905.54]  they don't have a space.
[5905.72 --> 5906.92]  I think this is the same thing.
[5907.32 --> 5907.66]  Oh yeah.
[5908.64 --> 5908.98]  Wow.
[5908.98 --> 5909.46]  Thank you,
[5909.56 --> 5910.22]  professor Luke.
[5910.40 --> 5910.78]  No problem.
[5910.90 --> 5911.00]  You,
[5911.12 --> 5911.34]  he,
[5911.44 --> 5912.80]  you played spot the AI.
[5912.98 --> 5913.36]  You won.
[5913.54 --> 5913.90]  No,
[5913.98 --> 5914.42]  I mean like,
[5914.48 --> 5917.80]  I think it's literally the same like person behind it.
[5917.80 --> 5917.98]  Yeah.
[5917.98 --> 5918.12]  Yeah.
[5918.12 --> 5918.26]  Yeah.
[5918.48 --> 5919.06]  But I,
[5919.26 --> 5921.96]  why I don't think an AI would just not put a space in the name.
[5922.14 --> 5924.84]  Like I think somebody actually just named this themselves.
[5925.28 --> 5925.52]  Yeah.
[5925.52 --> 5926.88]  And it's just AI generating photos.
[5926.96 --> 5927.04]  Yeah.
[5927.08 --> 5927.36]  That could,
[5927.42 --> 5928.50]  that could very well be.
[5928.58 --> 5929.48]  Cause I,
[5929.82 --> 5930.40]  I mean,
[5930.44 --> 5930.60]  yeah,
[5930.60 --> 5930.98]  there's probably,
[5930.98 --> 5931.10]  no,
[5931.14 --> 5933.08]  there's probably tools to like mass create accounts,
[5933.08 --> 5934.34]  but surely you would have to,
[5934.74 --> 5935.60]  you would have to approve.
[5935.60 --> 5936.06]  It's just,
[5936.28 --> 5940.72]  I don't think this is one of those mistakes that an AI would even make.
[5940.88 --> 5941.06]  Yeah.
[5941.14 --> 5942.56]  It would put a space after the amber side.
[5942.56 --> 5942.76]  You know,
[5942.80 --> 5947.74]  that's something I've started noticing a lot lately is like when something is bad,
[5947.74 --> 5949.10]  it almost,
[5949.10 --> 5951.08]  it almost makes me,
[5951.16 --> 5952.66]  it almost makes me feel like,
[5952.70 --> 5952.80]  Oh,
[5952.82 --> 5953.32]  this is real.
[5953.78 --> 5954.26]  Yeah.
[5956.12 --> 5960.58]  Cause there's just absolutely no reason to make an error like that anymore.
[5960.88 --> 5961.24]  Exactly.
[5962.14 --> 5962.50]  Um,
[5962.94 --> 5963.28]  I'm like,
[5963.34 --> 5964.18]  why did it happen twice?
[5964.38 --> 5964.56]  Yeah.
[5964.58 --> 5965.82]  The big question here though,
[5965.82 --> 5967.34]  is who's the sniper?
[5969.02 --> 5969.38]  What?
[5969.50 --> 5969.70]  Oh,
[5969.80 --> 5970.58]  Oh,
[5972.80 --> 5974.56]  what do they have against Jesus?
[5975.06 --> 5979.62]  I'm sure that's just the AI not really understanding that that's actually like supposed to be a window or something.
[5980.24 --> 5981.06]  And it's just like,
[5981.12 --> 5981.30]  ah,
[5981.30 --> 5981.56]  sure.
[5981.64 --> 5982.04]  Why not?
[5982.16 --> 5982.92]  We'll put that there.
[5983.20 --> 5983.60]  Um,
[5984.12 --> 5984.50]  I don't know.
[5984.54 --> 5988.32]  Our discussion question is how big of a threat is out of control spam for companies like that?
[5988.42 --> 5988.70]  I mean,
[5988.70 --> 5989.82]  well,
[5989.88 --> 5990.56]  hold on a second.
[5991.40 --> 5997.90]  Because it's not like the lowest common denominator that are unironically interacting with this stuff can even tell the difference.
[5997.90 --> 5998.92]  So why does it matter?
[5999.48 --> 6000.06]  Like for,
[6000.16 --> 6001.08]  for their user base,
[6001.20 --> 6002.02]  what difference does it make?
[6002.02 --> 6002.12]  Yeah,
[6002.12 --> 6002.72]  but I think the whole,
[6002.82 --> 6002.92]  like,
[6002.96 --> 6003.50]  what is it?
[6003.62 --> 6003.94]  Is the,
[6004.00 --> 6004.54]  the,
[6004.54 --> 6005.80]  Daniel,
[6005.94 --> 6006.06]  no,
[6006.10 --> 6007.20]  is it fake internet theory?
[6007.44 --> 6007.84]  What is it?
[6008.18 --> 6008.86]  Dead internet theory.
[6008.86 --> 6009.54]  Dead internet theory.
[6009.56 --> 6010.16]  Or dead mall.
[6010.26 --> 6010.48]  Oh,
[6010.54 --> 6011.12]  this is hilarious.
[6011.56 --> 6011.92]  Okay.
[6011.92 --> 6012.20]  No,
[6012.26 --> 6013.32]  this totally makes sense.
[6013.40 --> 6013.50]  Yeah.
[6013.54 --> 6014.88]  Floatplane chat figured it out.
[6014.94 --> 6015.16]  It's,
[6015.54 --> 6015.88]  it's,
[6015.94 --> 6017.02]  he didn't get,
[6017.24 --> 6019.10]  it's adapted for modern times.
[6019.18 --> 6019.96]  He didn't get crucified.
[6019.96 --> 6021.16]  It was firing squad.
[6021.16 --> 6023.00]  But that,
[6023.06 --> 6023.20]  that,
[6023.38 --> 6024.40]  that's what they're representing.
[6027.68 --> 6028.08]  Thanks,
[6028.16 --> 6028.72]  Floatplane chat.
[6028.78 --> 6029.98]  You guys got this sorted out.
[6030.86 --> 6031.82]  To be clear,
[6031.92 --> 6032.22]  to be,
[6032.30 --> 6033.12]  to be clear,
[6033.24 --> 6033.90]  to be clear.
[6033.90 --> 6034.36]  Okay.
[6035.56 --> 6036.34]  Regardless of,
[6036.42 --> 6037.44]  regardless of alignment,
[6037.62 --> 6039.80]  this kind of thing is obviously ridiculous.
[6039.80 --> 6042.24]  And that's the reason that I'm making light of it.
[6042.36 --> 6042.86]  Because it's just,
[6042.86 --> 6043.60]  go to Luke cam.
[6043.68 --> 6044.56]  Clearly silly.
[6045.04 --> 6045.98]  This poor man.
[6046.12 --> 6046.50]  I know.
[6047.26 --> 6048.22]  Is it hard?
[6048.88 --> 6049.28]  Sometimes.
[6049.78 --> 6050.14]  Is it,
[6050.14 --> 6050.98]  is it hard?
[6051.14 --> 6051.88]  It's usually fine,
[6051.98 --> 6052.52]  but sometimes.
[6052.74 --> 6053.28]  Is it hard,
[6053.40 --> 6053.56]  Luke?
[6054.00 --> 6054.72]  Right now.
[6054.72 --> 6060.50]  Why did the right now make me understand?
[6061.18 --> 6062.52]  I don't know.
[6064.68 --> 6065.34]  Oh yeah.
[6065.40 --> 6066.28]  Made you think about it.
[6066.48 --> 6066.94]  This is bad though.
[6067.02 --> 6067.12]  Like,
[6067.20 --> 6068.14]  Twitter is,
[6068.22 --> 6070.26]  is just overran by bots.
[6070.46 --> 6070.88]  Oh my,
[6071.14 --> 6071.36]  I,
[6071.36 --> 6072.90]  it's actually wild.
[6073.14 --> 6073.38]  Okay.
[6073.96 --> 6080.68]  Anyone who claims to not be able to accidentally find pornographic material on Twitter,
[6080.68 --> 6087.32]  you are an actual liar or your bar for what is considered pornography is extremely high.
[6088.62 --> 6089.56]  I was just,
[6089.66 --> 6091.76]  I was just looking at the ads now that are like,
[6091.86 --> 6094.96]  I was looking at the yard post that the,
[6094.96 --> 6096.32]  the episode that I,
[6096.46 --> 6100.86]  that I was a guest on was up and man,
[6100.98 --> 6105.36]  I wanted to see what the hidden for offensive content comments were.
[6105.40 --> 6108.32]  And one of them was just from someone very confused,
[6108.32 --> 6110.06]  which was kind of funny.
[6110.06 --> 6110.42]  And I,
[6110.46 --> 6112.12]  I do read those comments sometimes.
[6112.40 --> 6115.12]  And then one of them was guys,
[6115.20 --> 6115.58]  don't,
[6115.70 --> 6116.44]  if you're at work,
[6116.48 --> 6117.02]  do not,
[6117.06 --> 6119.20]  do not unhide any,
[6119.38 --> 6120.58]  any hidden comments on that.
[6120.58 --> 6121.08]  Cause it's,
[6121.08 --> 6121.32]  yeah,
[6121.32 --> 6124.42]  it's very definitely above your bar,
[6124.50 --> 6125.32]  whatever your bar is.
[6125.62 --> 6126.28]  Twitter is,
[6126.32 --> 6127.02]  Twitter is brutal.
[6127.34 --> 6127.52]  Yeah.
[6127.62 --> 6128.70]  I don't even know.
[6128.84 --> 6130.94]  I don't even know what to make of it at this point.
[6130.96 --> 6138.86]  Like at what point can we not ask our staff to be on a platform as part of their work?
[6139.12 --> 6139.52]  Interesting.
[6140.06 --> 6141.96]  Like,
[6142.02 --> 6144.38]  do we have to basically create a policy at this point?
[6144.42 --> 6145.62]  If this gets any worse,
[6145.76 --> 6146.92]  do we tell the social team?
[6146.98 --> 6147.12]  Okay,
[6147.12 --> 6147.44]  look,
[6147.98 --> 6148.28]  um,
[6148.32 --> 6149.68]  you guys can post on this.
[6149.88 --> 6151.04]  You can decide to not,
[6151.18 --> 6151.52]  if you,
[6151.62 --> 6152.70]  but realistically,
[6152.70 --> 6153.42]  um,
[6153.46 --> 6157.92]  we advise against consuming any content on this platform at work.
[6157.98 --> 6158.62]  You can't,
[6158.68 --> 6160.52]  or even you can't like,
[6160.56 --> 6161.06]  we can't,
[6161.06 --> 6161.98]  we can't tell people,
[6162.06 --> 6162.16]  yeah,
[6162.18 --> 6162.64]  go ahead,
[6162.74 --> 6163.18]  find porn,
[6163.30 --> 6165.18]  like view pornography at work.
[6165.18 --> 6165.78]  That's not,
[6166.02 --> 6167.52]  that's not okay.
[6168.28 --> 6169.56]  I saw one during the show.
[6170.04 --> 6170.40]  Ugh,
[6170.60 --> 6170.88]  Dan,
[6171.20 --> 6172.52]  don't tell me that.
[6172.52 --> 6173.58]  I mean,
[6173.60 --> 6174.14]  it's a problem.
[6174.54 --> 6175.44]  Is it not okay?
[6175.78 --> 6177.26]  If the employee's okay with it,
[6177.28 --> 6177.90]  is it not okay?
[6178.32 --> 6178.58]  Yeah,
[6178.58 --> 6179.72]  I'm pretty sure it's not okay.
[6179.94 --> 6184.60]  I don't think it matters because it all comes back to that question of like the power dynamic.
[6184.96 --> 6185.84]  So even if,
[6185.84 --> 6187.70]  even if they're okay,
[6188.40 --> 6188.66]  right?
[6188.72 --> 6189.84]  Even if they're okay,
[6189.84 --> 6194.10]  the fact that I told them to do it might put pressure on them to be okay.
[6194.82 --> 6195.18]  Yeah,
[6195.28 --> 6195.40]  yeah,
[6195.40 --> 6195.62]  no,
[6195.62 --> 6195.78]  no,
[6195.78 --> 6195.80]  no,
[6195.80 --> 6195.84]  no,
[6195.84 --> 6196.10]  no.
[6196.10 --> 6197.24]  And then even if they say it's okay,
[6197.24 --> 6198.60]  they might come back later and,
[6198.62 --> 6200.66]  and retroactively decide it wasn't okay.
[6200.66 --> 6201.08]  That's the weird part.
[6201.10 --> 6202.60]  So we almost have to get out ahead of it,
[6202.64 --> 6202.84]  right?
[6203.10 --> 6204.98]  If you don't tell them to do it,
[6205.22 --> 6205.84]  if you say like,
[6205.90 --> 6207.30]  we would like posts on Instagram,
[6207.48 --> 6207.86]  but if,
[6207.94 --> 6209.14]  if anyone's uncomfortable with that,
[6209.16 --> 6209.54]  you don't have,
[6209.58 --> 6209.70]  or,
[6209.72 --> 6210.06]  uh,
[6210.06 --> 6210.30]  Twitter,
[6210.68 --> 6211.70]  but if anyone's uncomfortable with that,
[6211.74 --> 6212.40]  you don't have to do it.
[6212.46 --> 6212.98]  And that doesn't,
[6212.98 --> 6214.10]  and not everyone's in a,
[6214.14 --> 6215.18]  in a private office too,
[6215.24 --> 6215.42]  right?
[6215.42 --> 6218.40]  Like that doesn't account for if anyone's walking behind their desk and
[6218.40 --> 6220.52]  someone's just banging on their screen.
[6220.52 --> 6221.00]  Yeah.
[6221.28 --> 6221.46]  Right.
[6221.46 --> 6222.42]  Like we can't,
[6222.48 --> 6224.12]  we can't ask people to be subjected to that.
[6224.18 --> 6224.48]  So we,
[6224.56 --> 6224.94]  I mean,
[6225.24 --> 6225.46]  I,
[6225.46 --> 6225.62]  I,
[6225.74 --> 6227.44]  we should raise this next week,
[6227.44 --> 6228.58]  like an exec meeting.
[6228.58 --> 6228.76]  Like,
[6228.76 --> 6233.38]  should we have a serious discussion about whether Twitter is a site that is
[6233.38 --> 6235.62]  allowed to be accessed on our network?
[6235.62 --> 6236.84]  There's probably a,
[6236.84 --> 6241.02]  there's probably a way to offer the like IT team to block all the images that
[6241.02 --> 6241.74]  load on Twitter.
[6242.98 --> 6243.22]  I mean,
[6243.24 --> 6243.60]  I'd be,
[6243.72 --> 6245.20]  I'd be interested in that as a solution.
[6245.32 --> 6245.50]  Yeah.
[6245.64 --> 6245.94]  How to,
[6246.00 --> 6246.26]  how to,
[6246.34 --> 6247.90]  how to safer work your Twitter account.
[6249.04 --> 6249.36]  Dude,
[6249.44 --> 6250.16]  this is ridiculous.
[6250.96 --> 6251.48]  It is,
[6251.52 --> 6254.62]  it is actually genuinely getting like the fact that we even have to have this
[6254.62 --> 6255.60]  conversation and,
[6255.66 --> 6256.14]  and you know what?
[6256.14 --> 6256.80]  We might not,
[6256.86 --> 6258.40]  we might not do anything with it.
[6258.44 --> 6259.24]  We might kind of go,
[6259.24 --> 6260.66]  the team might come back and say like,
[6260.74 --> 6260.86]  look,
[6260.94 --> 6261.08]  yeah,
[6261.14 --> 6265.58]  if you don't dig into the show offensive replies and if we don't go onto any
[6265.58 --> 6266.02]  trends,
[6266.02 --> 6267.80]  like if we just kind of stay on our own replies,
[6268.10 --> 6268.64]  it's fine.
[6269.08 --> 6269.40]  Yeah.
[6269.40 --> 6269.50]  Yeah.
[6269.50 --> 6269.94]  The trends,
[6270.02 --> 6270.22]  man,
[6270.32 --> 6270.78]  you like,
[6270.86 --> 6271.98]  I'll also get it in my,
[6272.12 --> 6272.48]  in the,
[6272.48 --> 6272.80]  the,
[6272.80 --> 6275.18]  whatever the mixed news feed is.
[6275.22 --> 6279.44]  If I look at just my notifications or whatever that section's called,
[6279.44 --> 6280.90]  like things that are directed towards me,
[6280.96 --> 6281.94]  it's generally fine.
[6281.94 --> 6283.14]  My mentions are generally fine.
[6283.14 --> 6283.30]  Yeah.
[6283.40 --> 6283.96]  Not always,
[6284.50 --> 6285.58]  but not always.
[6285.70 --> 6285.88]  Yeah.
[6286.68 --> 6287.08]  But,
[6287.12 --> 6289.18]  but usually vast majority of the time it's okay.
[6289.34 --> 6290.64]  But if I look at the,
[6290.64 --> 6291.70]  the full mixed feed,
[6291.70 --> 6293.40]  it's like pretty high percentage.
[6293.66 --> 6293.78]  Yeah.
[6295.86 --> 6297.30]  Walmart comes to,
[6297.42 --> 6297.72]  Oh wait,
[6297.78 --> 6298.46]  no sponsors.
[6298.66 --> 6298.94]  All right,
[6298.94 --> 6299.28]  I'll do it.
[6299.32 --> 6300.14]  I'm doing it,
[6300.22 --> 6300.38]  Dan.
[6300.68 --> 6300.82]  Fine,
[6300.92 --> 6301.22]  Dan.
[6301.62 --> 6303.42]  The show is brought to you today by Vessi.
[6303.50 --> 6304.14]  Get what you want.
[6304.22 --> 6308.16]  Are we still playing guessing games about whether it's going to rain with Vessi?
[6308.28 --> 6311.52]  You don't have to roll the dice on whether you'll have wet socks or not.
[6311.52 --> 6312.74]  You can just not.
[6313.12 --> 6314.32]  Not only do they look stylish,
[6314.44 --> 6317.78]  they're also extremely waterproof according to Vessi.
[6318.18 --> 6321.64]  And being such doesn't mean that your feet have to suffocate.
[6321.76 --> 6323.22]  Thanks to their Dimatex technology,
[6323.34 --> 6324.44]  Vessi's shoes are breathable,
[6324.80 --> 6326.32]  light and stretchy.
[6327.00 --> 6331.02]  Their Stormburst line of shoes is great for slippery sidewalks and mossy logs on trails
[6331.02 --> 6332.28]  since they have extra traction.
[6332.88 --> 6335.72]  And right now you can get the Stormburst in a low top.
[6336.02 --> 6337.44]  So rain or shine here or there,
[6337.54 --> 6339.88]  it's always a great occasion to wear a pair of Vessi's.
[6339.88 --> 6344.58]  Go to Vessi.com slash Wanshow and get 15% off your first purchase.
[6345.18 --> 6346.18]  Vessi's one of those sponsors,
[6346.34 --> 6346.48]  man,
[6346.58 --> 6350.42]  that the first time they sponsored us was the first time I'd heard of them.
[6350.80 --> 6351.70]  And now?
[6351.98 --> 6352.94]  Now they're huge.
[6352.96 --> 6353.16]  Dude,
[6353.26 --> 6354.00]  go to a mall.
[6354.48 --> 6354.70]  Yeah.
[6354.84 --> 6355.18]  Just like,
[6355.78 --> 6356.06]  whoa,
[6356.26 --> 6357.48]  there's Vessi's everywhere.
[6357.90 --> 6359.96]  Clearly nobody actually bought shoes at this mall.
[6360.24 --> 6361.62]  They bought them from Vessi.
[6361.90 --> 6362.10]  Yeah.
[6362.22 --> 6362.64]  It's wild.
[6363.16 --> 6364.82]  The show is also brought to you by Squarespace.

[6420.90 --> 6422.52]  The show is also brought to you by Manscaped.
[6422.72 --> 6425.42]  There is nothing scarier than a swimming Sasquatch.
[6425.74 --> 6426.98]  And that could be you,
[6427.12 --> 6428.58]  if you don't use Manscaped.
[6429.28 --> 6433.50]  It's time to trim your hedges with Manscaped's Lawnmower 5.0 Ultra.
[6433.82 --> 6436.44]  It comes with a trimmer blade and a foil blade.
[6436.78 --> 6437.72]  They're interchangeable,
[6437.78 --> 6439.90]  letting you choose if you want just a little trim off the top,
[6440.02 --> 6440.98]  or a smooth finish.
[6441.38 --> 6444.24]  And it's got a waterproof IPX7 rating.
[6444.46 --> 6446.56]  So you can get your business done in the shower.
[6446.86 --> 6448.44]  To make trimming even easier,
[6448.64 --> 6450.82]  its LED light lets you see right through the shrubbery.
[6451.10 --> 6454.28]  And it's portable and can be charged conveniently with a USB-C cable,
[6454.42 --> 6456.74]  meaning you can whack the weeds anywhere you might be.
[6457.14 --> 6457.90]  And that's not all.

[6466.94 --> 6468.40]  All right.
[6468.46 --> 6469.90]  Do you want to do the sonic one?
[6470.04 --> 6473.10]  I want to talk about your face for a second.
[6473.34 --> 6474.58]  You want to talk about my face?
[6474.72 --> 6475.62]  Your hair's coming back in.
[6476.12 --> 6476.44]  My hair?
[6476.54 --> 6477.18]  Your beard.
[6477.76 --> 6478.28]  Oh, I just,
[6478.50 --> 6480.32]  I didn't shave this morning.
[6480.46 --> 6481.28]  I shaved last night.
[6481.50 --> 6482.70]  So this is a fun one.
[6483.02 --> 6484.12]  That facial treatment that I did,
[6484.20 --> 6485.40]  apparently it stimulates hair growth.
[6485.90 --> 6486.26]  Oh.
[6486.26 --> 6487.62]  So my beard's been,
[6487.76 --> 6490.60]  like if I don't shave for like 36 hours,
[6490.76 --> 6491.88]  like I look like a mountain man.
[6492.20 --> 6493.08]  Are you just going to let it go?
[6493.70 --> 6494.62]  Oh, no, I am.
[6495.14 --> 6496.78]  But no, I got to finish my paint job.
[6497.92 --> 6498.28]  Oh.
[6498.46 --> 6498.60]  Yeah.
[6498.74 --> 6501.66]  So my motorbike paint job got kind of interrupted
[6501.66 --> 6502.94]  by Poof's car paint job,
[6503.00 --> 6504.12]  which by the way, have you seen now?
[6504.32 --> 6504.68]  Yes.
[6504.74 --> 6505.54]  He pulled into work.
[6505.56 --> 6506.02]  What do you think?
[6506.08 --> 6508.08]  It's not as striking as the,
[6508.08 --> 6509.26]  you know,
[6509.38 --> 6510.54]  the hot pink.
[6510.70 --> 6511.58]  I kind of,
[6511.60 --> 6513.66]  I kind of got cold feet
[6513.66 --> 6515.24]  and I wanted it to look cool.
[6515.24 --> 6516.72]  It looks pretty cool.
[6516.74 --> 6518.26]  Instead of just like an acid trip.
[6518.72 --> 6518.94]  Yeah.
[6519.80 --> 6522.00]  It's not the acid trip of the original.
[6522.30 --> 6522.60]  No.
[6522.78 --> 6523.42]  The original.
[6523.72 --> 6524.56]  It's pretty cool.
[6524.66 --> 6525.46]  But it's, it's cool.
[6525.64 --> 6526.96]  I reviewed the video, by the way,
[6527.06 --> 6527.90]  it's right before WAN show.
[6527.98 --> 6528.36]  It's great.
[6528.44 --> 6529.74]  It's significantly more like,
[6529.80 --> 6531.98]  you know, livable than the first one.
[6532.00 --> 6532.18]  Oh, man.
[6532.26 --> 6533.90]  His car is like sick.
[6534.38 --> 6536.64]  And I loved the way that Alex framed the intro.
[6537.04 --> 6539.56]  So we added better headlights,
[6540.24 --> 6541.14]  acoustic dampening.
[6541.56 --> 6543.56]  We added power locks,
[6543.92 --> 6544.70]  power windows,
[6544.70 --> 6546.66]  and we did all of those upgrades
[6546.66 --> 6548.00]  for less than the price
[6548.00 --> 6549.26]  of a single monthly payment
[6549.26 --> 6550.06]  on a brand new Civic.
[6550.84 --> 6551.24]  Whoa.
[6551.46 --> 6551.58]  Yeah.
[6551.60 --> 6553.26]  I thought that was such a cool way to frame it.
[6553.34 --> 6553.52]  Wow.
[6553.56 --> 6554.84]  That is a really cool way to frame it.
[6554.84 --> 6555.16]  Yeah.
[6556.26 --> 6556.54]  And we,
[6556.62 --> 6557.20]  and we pulled it off.
[6557.20 --> 6558.26]  I'm immediately interested in that.
[6558.36 --> 6558.68]  Yeah.
[6558.82 --> 6559.38]  That's awesome.
[6559.66 --> 6560.02]  Yeah.
[6560.26 --> 6560.70]  Good job.
[6560.76 --> 6563.50]  The paint job was several payments,
[6563.76 --> 6565.40]  but don't worry about that.
[6565.40 --> 6565.84]  That was,
[6565.90 --> 6566.58]  that was gratis.
[6566.58 --> 6567.46]  But you don't have to paint.
[6567.46 --> 6568.22]  That was for fun.
[6568.36 --> 6568.50]  Yeah.
[6568.70 --> 6569.52]  Yeah, exactly.
[6569.72 --> 6570.04]  Exactly.
[6570.30 --> 6571.74]  That part was just for LOLs.
[6571.74 --> 6573.34]  A ton of fun.
[6573.42 --> 6574.50]  And I learned a lot.
[6574.90 --> 6576.98]  We used a high build primer by accident.
[6577.30 --> 6577.46]  I,
[6578.02 --> 6580.00]  it's one of those things where like,
[6580.48 --> 6582.48]  I wouldn't have bought that one,
[6582.70 --> 6586.54]  but I could have saved it by doing some research
[6586.54 --> 6588.18]  and using some reducer in it,
[6588.18 --> 6589.52]  which I had on hand.
[6589.62 --> 6590.56]  But I was just like,
[6590.60 --> 6590.88]  I mean,
[6590.96 --> 6592.18]  probably this will be fine.
[6592.18 --> 6593.18]  And I started spraying it.
[6593.18 --> 6595.80]  And that's why it has that like texture to it
[6595.80 --> 6599.28]  because my gun is rated for maximum nine PSI.
[6599.52 --> 6602.96]  And that high build primer wants 20 PSI.
[6603.06 --> 6605.26]  So basically it didn't completely atomize
[6605.26 --> 6607.34]  and it just like blew chunks at the car.
[6608.16 --> 6608.18]  So,
[6608.34 --> 6608.78]  um,
[6608.82 --> 6609.02]  okay.
[6609.02 --> 6611.06]  So you're still shaving because you need the mask
[6611.06 --> 6611.80]  to make a seal.
[6612.00 --> 6612.26]  Yeah.
[6612.38 --> 6612.58]  Yeah.
[6612.58 --> 6614.68]  So that my like organic filter,
[6614.68 --> 6615.52]  uh,
[6615.54 --> 6617.42]  mask is still good while I'm finishing up my bike.
[6617.50 --> 6619.68]  I'm going to do a bunch of color tests this weekend.
[6619.68 --> 6620.92]  I'm really excited about that.
[6620.92 --> 6624.24]  So I've got a bunch of different variations of undercoat,
[6624.34 --> 6624.86]  mid coat,
[6624.86 --> 6627.12]  and then top coats and effects and stuff like that.
[6627.14 --> 6627.58]  And I've got,
[6627.62 --> 6628.16]  uh,
[6628.16 --> 6631.00]  an order of speed shapes I got from Aliexpress for like $2.
[6631.66 --> 6631.94]  Uh,
[6631.94 --> 6634.08]  so speed shapes are basically things like this.
[6634.08 --> 6636.06]  And they just have like kind of contours like a car.
[6636.06 --> 6638.72]  So you can paint them and then kind of see what it looks like
[6638.72 --> 6639.52]  from different angles.
[6639.52 --> 6639.96]  Got it.
[6640.00 --> 6640.96]  I'm going to get that done.
[6640.96 --> 6643.54]  And I'm just going to settle on a bloody color and get this thing done.
[6643.54 --> 6647.16]  Even though we haven't really quite gotten to the level of vibrant pink
[6647.16 --> 6647.98]  that I would like,
[6647.98 --> 6649.94]  I'm just going to have to kind of live with it and get it done.
[6649.94 --> 6651.14]  I want to ride it this season.
[6651.22 --> 6651.52]  Darn it.
[6653.36 --> 6654.00]  Other than that,
[6654.04 --> 6655.38]  I didn't have a particular topic.
[6655.58 --> 6655.98]  Uh,
[6655.98 --> 6656.58]  we could talk about,
[6656.58 --> 6656.70]  Oh,
[6656.72 --> 6657.80]  we're supposed to do merge messages.
[6658.26 --> 6658.54]  Oh,
[6660.60 --> 6661.02]  nevermind.
[6661.20 --> 6661.48]  You don't,
[6661.60 --> 6662.68]  you don't have to.
[6662.74 --> 6663.26]  Can you pick one?
[6663.26 --> 6664.40]  So antagonistic.
[6664.82 --> 6665.96]  I'm going to run to the washroom real quick.
[6666.00 --> 6666.42]  I'll be right back.
[6666.82 --> 6667.08]  All right.
[6667.08 --> 6667.82]  We'll get one for Luke.
[6668.14 --> 6668.44]  Yeah.
[6669.92 --> 6670.28]  Uh,
[6670.28 --> 6671.28]  question for Luke.
[6671.46 --> 6671.70]  Yes.
[6671.70 --> 6676.86]  If you got offered a job at from a NASA or a similar dream job,
[6676.86 --> 6677.02]  right?
[6677.02 --> 6677.92]  When Linus leaves,
[6677.92 --> 6680.54]  would you leave LMG and move to the U S for it?
[6680.54 --> 6684.44]  I'd be really tempted,
[6684.44 --> 6686.04]  but as of right now,
[6686.04 --> 6686.94]  I don't think I could.
[6687.40 --> 6687.88]  Um,
[6687.88 --> 6692.78]  I feel too much direct responsibility to certain teams,
[6692.92 --> 6693.52]  certain people here,
[6693.58 --> 6694.04]  stuff like that.
[6694.06 --> 6695.92]  I don't know if that would ever necessarily change.
[6696.24 --> 6696.86]  Maybe it will.
[6696.94 --> 6697.48]  Maybe it won't.
[6697.76 --> 6698.16]  Um,
[6698.88 --> 6702.32]  but I would be extremely flattered.
[6702.68 --> 6703.62]  I'd say that much.
[6703.62 --> 6707.48]  I'd be a little bit confused as to what NASA would want to do with me.
[6708.12 --> 6708.50]  Um,
[6709.02 --> 6710.88]  but I'd be interested.
[6712.62 --> 6713.02]  Yeah,
[6713.16 --> 6713.78]  that's it.
[6714.06 --> 6714.98]  Maybe a boring answer.
[6715.50 --> 6715.86]  Greetings,
[6716.06 --> 6716.56]  LLD.
[6716.56 --> 6718.88]  I'm watching float plane from an airplane.
[6719.98 --> 6720.34]  Sick.
[6720.72 --> 6721.06]  Luke,
[6721.36 --> 6723.84]  what processes do you have in place?
[6724.18 --> 6724.58]  Oh boy.
[6724.72 --> 6730.20]  To help your development teams actually accurately forecast delivery timelines.
[6730.38 --> 6730.78]  Any,
[6730.96 --> 6732.70]  any implementation tips?
[6732.70 --> 6733.26]  I mean,
[6733.96 --> 6735.20]  I'm going to say no.
[6735.78 --> 6736.12]  Oops.
[6736.64 --> 6737.08]  Uh,
[6737.12 --> 6737.44]  sorry.
[6737.54 --> 6738.34]  What was the last,
[6738.42 --> 6739.20]  what was the last line?
[6739.42 --> 6740.58]  Any implementation tips?
[6741.70 --> 6742.18]  Implementation.
[6743.08 --> 6743.34]  Uh,
[6743.62 --> 6744.70]  uh,
[6744.70 --> 6745.24]  uh,
[6745.24 --> 6745.70]  uh,
[6745.70 --> 6746.54]  uh,
[6746.56 --> 6748.66]  good luck,
[6748.72 --> 6749.06]  uh,
[6749.06 --> 6749.36]  James,
[6749.56 --> 6751.22]  have fun.
[6752.08 --> 6753.00]  So yeah,
[6753.00 --> 6754.84]  welcome to the world of developer timelines.
[6754.98 --> 6755.32]  Uh,
[6755.32 --> 6756.18]  they don't work.
[6756.38 --> 6756.68]  It's,
[6756.68 --> 6757.34]  it's like the,
[6757.58 --> 6758.46]  whose line is it anyways?
[6758.58 --> 6758.92]  Points.
[6760.26 --> 6761.34]  They don't matter.
[6761.44 --> 6762.26]  They don't exist.
[6762.70 --> 6763.02]  Um,
[6763.02 --> 6763.60]  they're made up.
[6763.78 --> 6764.16]  They're,
[6764.16 --> 6764.76]  they're made up.
[6764.76 --> 6771.50]  You start getting used to different people on your team and like how good like that person
[6771.50 --> 6773.14]  is at estimating time.
[6773.28 --> 6774.98]  Some teams can find,
[6774.98 --> 6775.78]  um,
[6777.02 --> 6778.82]  systems like they'll,
[6778.92 --> 6780.92]  they'll start like point scoring things.
[6780.92 --> 6782.86]  And a lot of teams will use different,
[6782.86 --> 6783.52]  uh,
[6783.52 --> 6785.18]  types of point scoring that they can have.
[6785.22 --> 6786.14]  People are saying scrum for them.
[6786.20 --> 6786.38]  And yeah,
[6786.40 --> 6786.76]  good luck.
[6786.84 --> 6787.16]  That doesn't,
[6787.68 --> 6791.14]  I don't find personally that that scrum actually helps you.
[6791.26 --> 6792.72]  There's a lot of issues with scrum in my opinion,
[6792.72 --> 6793.34]  but I don't,
[6793.42 --> 6798.00]  I don't actually find that scrum itself helps you estimate actual completion time of large projects
[6798.00 --> 6801.42]  that need multiple scrums to actually like be completed.
[6801.42 --> 6802.52]  Like maybe,
[6802.52 --> 6803.12]  and,
[6803.18 --> 6806.98]  and I mean you estimating the amount of time that it's going to take at the beginning of
[6806.98 --> 6807.54]  the project.
[6807.54 --> 6808.90]  Cause some people will cheat and be like,
[6808.96 --> 6809.12]  well,
[6809.22 --> 6812.70]  we know how much we can do roughly every two weeks.
[6812.72 --> 6815.18]  And then that's slightly inaccurate every time.
[6815.18 --> 6816.06]  So by the end,
[6816.06 --> 6817.82]  the assumption we made at the beginning is really wrong,
[6817.84 --> 6819.46]  but our assumptions along the way were pretty good.
[6819.46 --> 6820.68]  So therefore we did a good job.
[6820.68 --> 6820.98]  And it's like,
[6821.02 --> 6821.10]  well,
[6821.14 --> 6821.40]  no,
[6821.78 --> 6825.04]  because we're talking about the assumption made at the beginning compared to what the
[6825.04 --> 6826.24]  reality was at the end of it.
[6826.52 --> 6826.92]  Anyways.
[6827.30 --> 6827.70]  Um,
[6828.92 --> 6829.68]  but you can,
[6829.76 --> 6830.52]  you can do like,
[6830.52 --> 6836.26]  the best one that I've heard of is when teams start looking at jobs and they do a point
[6836.26 --> 6836.92]  scoring thing.
[6836.92 --> 6840.80]  So they try to assume the amount of like blocks of time that something will take.
[6840.82 --> 6841.84]  So they don't do it by hour.
[6841.84 --> 6844.44]  They do it by like half day or full day or something like that.
[6844.86 --> 6845.34]  Um,
[6845.60 --> 6848.12]  and they use that as project estimating.
[6848.12 --> 6852.22]  And then they review that after every project that they do to try to help themselves get more
[6852.22 --> 6853.14]  and more accurate over time.
[6853.44 --> 6859.80]  That is helpful for teams that often do at least somewhat similar things.
[6859.80 --> 6862.20]  If you're constantly doing very,
[6862.30 --> 6863.68]  very different things all the time,
[6863.74 --> 6866.42]  it's still going to be really tough to estimate.
[6866.86 --> 6867.18]  Um,
[6867.18 --> 6872.32]  I've actually found that I'm more successful when I just get used to roughly how inaccurate
[6872.32 --> 6878.30]  individuals are and then don't actually coach them on doing it at all and just have them
[6878.30 --> 6882.82]  keep doing their estimates as they have been and then buffer custom amounts per person.
[6882.82 --> 6885.08]  And then I've found that's actually pretty good.
[6885.58 --> 6885.82]  I'm,
[6885.88 --> 6887.54]  I'm pretty accurate that way.
[6887.88 --> 6888.20]  Um,
[6888.20 --> 6889.46]  as a blanket rule,
[6889.64 --> 6892.42]  I always add either two X or two weeks,
[6892.58 --> 6895.54]  whichever one feels more correct for the situation,
[6895.54 --> 6899.44]  add two weeks to it or double the amount of time that developer says they think it'll take.
[6899.44 --> 6900.44]  Um,
[6900.60 --> 6906.68]  a lot of developers are a little bit overconfident,
[6907.04 --> 6907.52]  um,
[6907.52 --> 6911.28]  or don't necessarily fully consider testing time,
[6911.28 --> 6911.76]  uh,
[6911.76 --> 6912.84]  different things like that,
[6912.88 --> 6915.86]  needing to go back and refine things or whatever else.
[6916.44 --> 6916.88]  Um,
[6917.00 --> 6921.04]  so just give them a little bit of extra time because you don't want them to,
[6921.04 --> 6924.22]  you don't want the blow of like,
[6924.24 --> 6924.72]  it's late.
[6924.72 --> 6927.46]  We need it now when they actually just want to do a good job.
[6927.88 --> 6928.28]  Um,
[6928.64 --> 6928.86]  yeah.
[6928.86 --> 6930.22]  So someone in Philippine chapter said,
[6930.28 --> 6930.70]  as a dev,
[6930.72 --> 6932.50]  I always feel bad when I underestimate time.
[6932.58 --> 6932.98]  Exactly.
[6933.20 --> 6934.62]  So if you're leaving devs,
[6934.88 --> 6943.10]  try to set them up for success by hopefully putting them in a situation where that's not really going to happen by buffering for them.
[6943.24 --> 6947.52]  One of the best ways to do this is not actually share the full communication with either end.
[6950.10 --> 6954.34]  Don't tell the devs that you buffered extra time for them until they run out of time.
[6954.72 --> 6959.10]  And don't tell the people that you're agreeing to do the project for that you buffered anytime.
[6959.32 --> 6961.02]  Just tell them the buffered amount.
[6961.38 --> 6963.66]  And then you end up delivering a little bit early.
[6963.88 --> 6965.60]  And then when the dev ran out of time,
[6965.62 --> 6967.22]  you can magically give them extra time.
[6967.48 --> 6970.22]  And then everyone on each end is happy and you just,
[6970.40 --> 6971.70]  it's all fine.
[6972.12 --> 6975.16]  So basically your career advice is lie through your teeth.
[6975.28 --> 6976.50]  So basically your community,
[6976.50 --> 6978.48]  your career advice is lie through your teeth.
[6978.50 --> 6978.52]  No,
[6978.58 --> 6981.54]  it's just correctly estimate and know the people that you're working with.
[6981.70 --> 6982.06]  I see.
[6982.32 --> 6982.50]  Yeah.
[6982.50 --> 6983.78]  All right.
[6984.54 --> 6984.88]  Hit me.
[6985.14 --> 6986.62]  Is there one for me or are you guys done?
[6988.00 --> 6988.18]  Yeah,
[6988.20 --> 6988.38]  sure.
[6988.40 --> 6989.30]  I got one for you here.
[6989.34 --> 6989.56]  Thanks,
[6989.64 --> 6989.86]  Dan.
[6990.24 --> 6991.16]  Let's see.
[6992.24 --> 6998.02]  Did you obtain any patents for your cable management designs or did you figure that if they get ripped
[6998.02 --> 6998.78]  off,
[6998.88 --> 7002.04]  it'll likely happen in China where all bets are off and decide not to bother?
[7002.70 --> 7004.08]  It's a combination of things.
[7004.22 --> 7004.48]  One,
[7004.78 --> 7006.02]  that second thing you said.
[7006.08 --> 7006.24]  Yeah.
[7006.30 --> 7006.54]  I mean,
[7006.58 --> 7007.04]  realistically,
[7007.04 --> 7007.84]  what are we going to do?
[7007.90 --> 7008.98]  Go after a Chinese company?
[7009.06 --> 7009.52]  They don't care.
[7009.92 --> 7011.08]  Their government doesn't care.
[7011.08 --> 7014.46]  They only care when Chinese companies get ripped off.
[7014.52 --> 7015.80]  It's actually really interesting.
[7015.80 --> 7019.26]  The double standards that exist in the eyes of the Chinese government.
[7020.96 --> 7021.90]  So realistically,
[7021.90 --> 7022.84]  we're not really.
[7023.00 --> 7023.28]  Yeah,
[7023.40 --> 7026.10]  we don't really think there's going to be any defense against that anyway.
[7026.72 --> 7027.60]  Number two,
[7027.82 --> 7030.66]  I don't think there's anything particularly patentable about it.
[7030.74 --> 7031.14]  It's a,
[7031.14 --> 7033.12]  it's a magnet attached to a piece of plastic.
[7033.12 --> 7034.02]  Like if we,
[7034.44 --> 7037.56]  if we had anything particularly novel about it,
[7037.56 --> 7039.00]  if anything,
[7039.10 --> 7040.22]  I think we'd be better off.
[7040.38 --> 7041.00]  It seems like it can make it better.
[7041.48 --> 7041.96]  I know.
[7042.32 --> 7042.54]  Yeah.
[7042.68 --> 7046.62]  But if there was anything that made it better or was particularly novel about it,
[7046.62 --> 7049.02]  I think we'd actually be better off just not mentioning it.
[7049.28 --> 7049.46]  Yeah.
[7049.54 --> 7052.06]  Because then their product might not do as well.
[7052.06 --> 7053.22]  Whereas if you patent something,
[7053.44 --> 7056.74]  you have to like include drawings and stuff of like how you do it,
[7056.78 --> 7060.32]  which I'd rather just not do if we had anything about it that made it special.
[7060.32 --> 7060.96]  Uh,
[7060.96 --> 7065.98]  and number three is a big part of what makes the cost of our products.
[7066.12 --> 7069.60]  So high is the raw material cost of the neodymium magnets.
[7069.96 --> 7071.42]  So with that in mind,
[7071.42 --> 7073.12]  if you were to make a knockoff,
[7073.24 --> 7074.82]  where are you saving your money?
[7075.06 --> 7075.54]  Exactly.
[7076.28 --> 7077.16]  You could,
[7077.66 --> 7077.92]  I mean,
[7077.94 --> 7079.54]  we already had the molding done in China.
[7079.88 --> 7082.96]  We already have the plastics shot in China.
[7083.10 --> 7086.32]  We're already buying neodymium from a supplier in China.
[7086.50 --> 7087.02]  So,
[7087.16 --> 7087.52]  okay.
[7087.86 --> 7089.62]  Chinese knockoff company,
[7090.38 --> 7093.42]  what exactly is your advantage going to be here?
[7093.84 --> 7094.18]  Um,
[7094.18 --> 7095.82]  you're going to do all the same things as us.
[7095.82 --> 7100.76]  And so if you build it to the same level of quality with the same amount of raw neodymium in it,
[7100.80 --> 7101.96]  your price is going to be high.
[7102.36 --> 7104.60]  So what they're going to do inevitably,
[7105.10 --> 7106.66]  you can mark my words on this.
[7106.72 --> 7109.16]  What they're going to do is they're going to cheap out on the neodymium.
[7110.20 --> 7111.34]  It won't hold as well.
[7111.60 --> 7112.54]  And they wouldn't,
[7112.72 --> 7113.02]  even if,
[7113.12 --> 7115.78]  if we did have something special that we did to make it better,
[7115.92 --> 7117.34]  they won't figure that out.
[7117.40 --> 7118.00]  They won't notice.
[7118.12 --> 7118.80]  They won't care.
[7118.80 --> 7123.90]  Because all people ordering online are going to see is that it's the same shape and it has a magnet in it.
[7123.94 --> 7125.64]  They're not going to know how deep the magnet goes.
[7126.10 --> 7128.24]  And so those magnets are going to break more easily.
[7128.40 --> 7129.62]  They're not going to hold as well.
[7129.92 --> 7130.74]  People are going to get it.
[7130.80 --> 7132.36]  They're going to find out that it sucks.
[7132.36 --> 7133.48]  And then if anything,
[7133.48 --> 7136.20]  it's just marketing for our products because ours is the real one.
[7136.24 --> 7136.96]  Ours is the good one.
[7137.32 --> 7145.24]  So we didn't really see the point because it's a really great product and it's quality and it's selling really great.
[7145.68 --> 7147.02]  So yeah,
[7147.04 --> 7148.24]  we'll see how it goes in the longer term,
[7148.36 --> 7149.42]  but no,
[7149.46 --> 7150.50]  I'm really not that worried about it.
[7150.50 --> 7153.40]  The only way to compete with us on price is to make a crappier product.
[7154.32 --> 7155.18]  Good luck with that.
[7155.38 --> 7155.84]  Got them.
[7155.84 --> 7164.14]  I don't know,
[7164.26 --> 7164.86]  man.
[7165.40 --> 7168.12]  Let's get these main topics out of the way just to make sure.
[7168.12 --> 7171.72]  AI powered race cars kind of suck so far.
[7172.22 --> 7174.36]  The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League,
[7174.46 --> 7177.96]  the world's first racing league featuring self-driving formula race cars,
[7178.08 --> 7179.70]  held two races this weekend.
[7180.16 --> 7182.78]  The first featured only self-driving race cars,
[7182.90 --> 7186.12]  while the second had self-driving cars compete against human drivers.
[7186.30 --> 7186.64]  Okay.
[7186.80 --> 7187.32]  That's interesting.
[7187.70 --> 7194.96]  The qualifying time trials prior to the race wound up being chaotic with the automatic race cars struggling to finish a lap
[7194.96 --> 7198.76]  and occasionally randomly jerking as if dodging an invisible obstruction.
[7200.48 --> 7201.84]  That's actually weird.
[7202.02 --> 7204.64]  Multiple cars spun out and at least one hit a wall.
[7204.82 --> 7206.22]  Did they not test this at all?
[7210.06 --> 7211.88]  Here's from the article on The Verge.
[7212.68 --> 7213.56]  Watch this car.
[7213.70 --> 7213.82]  Woo!
[7214.40 --> 7214.64]  Hey,
[7214.76 --> 7216.74]  how you doing?
[7218.88 --> 7219.32]  Huh.
[7219.92 --> 7220.66]  This is great.
[7220.72 --> 7220.98]  Hold on.
[7221.00 --> 7222.66]  You're about to watch a car turn into a wall,
[7222.70 --> 7223.06]  I think.
[7224.96 --> 7228.98]  Yeah,
[7229.10 --> 7229.38]  but...
[7229.38 --> 7229.44]  Lies,
[7229.54 --> 7230.56]  that car is still a car.
[7230.74 --> 7231.70]  It didn't turn into a wall.
[7231.92 --> 7232.78]  Oh my goodness.
[7233.34 --> 7233.74]  Misleading.
[7234.66 --> 7235.88]  Misleading The Verge.
[7236.58 --> 7236.98]  Misleading.
[7237.18 --> 7237.80]  Bad content.
[7238.00 --> 7238.88]  The qualifying time,
[7238.88 --> 7239.36]  or sorry,
[7239.48 --> 7240.10]  during the race,
[7240.20 --> 7241.78]  the leading car spun out,
[7241.86 --> 7242.94]  the second car passed,
[7243.04 --> 7245.24]  but an official threw a yellow flag.
[7245.66 --> 7249.14]  The other cars got confused and stopped behind the stalled car,
[7249.48 --> 7251.10]  as during a caution lap,
[7251.44 --> 7253.08]  cars are not allowed to pass each other.
[7253.08 --> 7254.82]  The autonomous cars were slow,
[7254.98 --> 7255.86]  especially around corners,
[7256.00 --> 7258.84]  and seemed to get confused by the smoke from other vehicles.
[7259.46 --> 7259.90]  Oh,
[7260.06 --> 7263.18]  one car misjudged another car's braking and rear-ended it.
[7265.08 --> 7265.44]  Hmm.
[7265.50 --> 7267.60]  This sounds like a very expensive hobby.
[7268.44 --> 7268.96]  Yeah.
[7271.90 --> 7272.38]  Yeah.
[7272.38 --> 7275.14]  Gifkeeper over on,
[7275.18 --> 7276.62]  in The Verge's comment says,
[7276.70 --> 7278.76]  people only watch F1 for when things go wrong,
[7278.82 --> 7280.60]  so I don't see anything bad about this.
[7280.96 --> 7281.40]  Stonks,
[7281.48 --> 7281.68]  dude.
[7281.76 --> 7283.10]  They're going to make so much money.
[7284.48 --> 7285.24]  So many things wrong with this.
[7285.24 --> 7286.16]  They're going to the moon.
[7286.38 --> 7287.36]  So many layers.
[7289.90 --> 7290.78]  That's amazing.
[7290.86 --> 7292.98]  All of the sponsors are just insurance companies.
[7292.98 --> 7298.24]  There's a lot of AI-driven cars on the road.
[7298.46 --> 7299.36]  This could be you.
[7299.64 --> 7299.96]  I get it.
[7299.96 --> 7301.16]  What you're watching right now.
[7301.22 --> 7301.98]  Injured by a Tesla?
[7302.28 --> 7303.98]  All the traditional automakers.
[7304.14 --> 7305.84]  All the traditional automakers who have-
[7305.84 --> 7306.64]  They're pumping this.
[7306.72 --> 7309.30]  Who have paused their investments in autonomous driving.
[7309.72 --> 7313.14]  Just putting it all into this to make Tesla look bad.
[7313.84 --> 7315.24]  Make people scared.
[7315.76 --> 7316.00]  Oh,
[7316.08 --> 7316.80]  that's so funny.
[7316.90 --> 7317.66]  This is amazing.
[7318.32 --> 7319.84]  I think that's mostly it.
[7319.94 --> 7321.26]  There's some discussion questions.
[7321.26 --> 7326.24]  What's the likely difference between programming a car to navigate a city versus programming it to complete a race?
[7326.54 --> 7326.90]  Honestly,
[7327.08 --> 7329.58]  I don't know enough about this to really comment on that,
[7329.66 --> 7330.64]  but for me,
[7330.76 --> 7332.54]  it's not necessarily the-
[7332.54 --> 7334.52]  Because the predictability of the track,
[7334.64 --> 7335.04]  theoretically,
[7335.24 --> 7335.98]  is a huge-
[7335.98 --> 7337.30]  Should be very high.
[7337.36 --> 7338.00]  Huge advantage.
[7338.10 --> 7339.70]  Even if you are using machine vision,
[7339.78 --> 7343.16]  which you would have to be doing in order to avoid obstacles or other vehicles,
[7343.78 --> 7348.88]  knowing the basic parameters is an enormous advantage.
[7348.88 --> 7349.92]  However,
[7350.86 --> 7353.20]  the speed at which things are happening,
[7353.20 --> 7357.74]  and the relatively speaking lack of clear rules,
[7358.36 --> 7360.00]  like on a public street,
[7360.50 --> 7364.80]  this sign means everyone should behave in this predictable manner.
[7365.02 --> 7366.52]  Whereas on this track-
[7366.52 --> 7366.88]  Oh, I see.
[7366.98 --> 7367.22]  Okay.
[7367.22 --> 7367.82]  It's,
[7368.48 --> 7368.82]  well,
[7369.06 --> 7370.22]  get there first.
[7370.38 --> 7370.62]  Yeah.
[7370.82 --> 7371.08]  Right?
[7371.56 --> 7372.28]  And obviously,
[7372.28 --> 7377.22]  they're going to program in some rules because they don't want their expensive machines to just get exploded.
[7377.52 --> 7378.56]  Randomly turn and drive into walls.
[7378.64 --> 7378.90]  But I mean,
[7378.94 --> 7379.64]  we've absolutely,
[7379.96 --> 7382.02]  speaking of randomly turning to the left,
[7382.40 --> 7384.20]  and driving into walls,
[7384.68 --> 7386.26]  let's,
[7386.50 --> 7386.70]  yeah,
[7386.78 --> 7387.24]  this thing.
[7387.24 --> 7389.38]  Like,
[7389.70 --> 7391.90]  racing all comes down to,
[7392.00 --> 7392.22]  you know,
[7392.30 --> 7394.56]  your risk to reward tolerance,
[7394.66 --> 7394.88]  right?
[7394.96 --> 7395.22]  So,
[7395.60 --> 7397.18]  this is one of the most,
[7397.32 --> 7398.36]  I'm not into racing,
[7398.78 --> 7402.60]  but this is one of the most amazing moments in race history.
[7402.80 --> 7403.24]  What is this?
[7405.16 --> 7406.20]  Your game move?
[7406.98 --> 7407.26]  Yeah,
[7407.36 --> 7407.62]  hold on,
[7407.64 --> 7408.68]  let me see if I can find this.
[7408.68 --> 7409.08]  So,
[7409.22 --> 7410.32]  Buddy's way behind.
[7411.96 --> 7412.52]  Hold on,
[7412.58 --> 7412.96]  where's my,
[7413.04 --> 7413.42]  oh man,
[7413.48 --> 7414.48]  where's my retention-
[7414.48 --> 7414.86]  This is sick!
[7414.86 --> 7415.68]  thing.
[7416.60 --> 7416.96]  Well,
[7417.86 --> 7418.08]  man,
[7418.16 --> 7418.44]  why is,
[7418.52 --> 7420.38]  why is this video trash?
[7422.92 --> 7423.28]  Well,
[7423.66 --> 7424.20]  anyway,
[7424.88 --> 7425.14]  yeah,
[7425.16 --> 7425.78]  I can't find it,
[7425.84 --> 7426.06]  but,
[7426.16 --> 7426.66]  yeah,
[7427.12 --> 7427.98]  unbelievable.
[7428.26 --> 7428.38]  Oh,
[7428.40 --> 7429.32]  apparently it's now banned.
[7429.52 --> 7429.66]  Yeah,
[7429.74 --> 7430.38]  it makes sense.
[7430.54 --> 7431.82]  Hate for anything interesting to happen.
[7431.92 --> 7432.50]  In all seriousness,
[7432.62 --> 7432.72]  though,
[7432.74 --> 7434.38]  that is crazy dangerous,
[7434.38 --> 7435.66]  and nobody should be doing that.
[7436.38 --> 7436.74]  Okay,
[7436.78 --> 7437.28]  here we go.
[7437.48 --> 7437.92]  Here we go.
[7437.98 --> 7438.42]  Here we've got,
[7438.56 --> 7439.42]  this is a dash cam.
[7440.04 --> 7440.66]  Here's a dash cam.
[7440.88 --> 7441.72]  I'm voting yes on that one,
[7441.80 --> 7441.92]  Dan.
[7441.98 --> 7442.38]  Look at him go.
[7442.38 --> 7445.36]  See you later,
[7445.46 --> 7445.68]  buddy!
[7446.60 --> 7446.96]  Wow,
[7447.08 --> 7448.46]  so even with all the friction-
[7448.46 --> 7448.48]  Yeah,
[7448.48 --> 7450.92]  it passes like six cars in the corner.
[7451.62 --> 7451.98]  Wow.
[7452.28 --> 7452.50]  Yeah,
[7452.68 --> 7453.54]  absolutely wild.
[7455.38 --> 7455.80]  But like,
[7455.90 --> 7456.70]  I don't know,
[7456.76 --> 7456.92]  man,
[7456.94 --> 7460.22]  like a machine can't run that risk.
[7460.26 --> 7461.54]  How's it going to make that decision?
[7461.54 --> 7463.30]  How's it going to be creatively like that?
[7463.46 --> 7463.88]  I mean,
[7463.88 --> 7464.76]  very few people do that,
[7464.86 --> 7465.10]  I think.
[7465.10 --> 7465.80]  That's true.
[7466.12 --> 7467.88]  He apparently pulled eight G's.
[7468.60 --> 7468.80]  Oh,
[7468.80 --> 7471.54]  wow.
[7472.38 --> 7475.82]  Wow.
[7479.92 --> 7483.64]  I wonder what kind of chances there were for him to just like break his car doing that.
[7483.74 --> 7484.54]  Laws Earth says,
[7484.66 --> 7486.04]  I'm a fan and watched it live.
[7486.12 --> 7488.92]  He literally just tried a video game move like he used on PlayStation.
[7494.46 --> 7495.30]  Not helping,
[7495.54 --> 7498.38]  not helping anything.
[7498.38 --> 7499.72]  All right,
[7499.76 --> 7500.68]  what else we got here?
[7501.24 --> 7503.14]  UK bans bad passwords.
[7503.28 --> 7503.46]  Yeah,
[7503.50 --> 7504.06]  this is interesting.
[7504.06 --> 7510.42]  The UK has updated its telecommunications security legislation to ban easily guessable default passwords.
[7511.00 --> 7515.40]  Now manufacturers will need to ensure their devices come up with a randomly generated password,
[7515.40 --> 7519.22]  or that they can generate a random password upon setup.
[7519.22 --> 7519.74]  Oh,
[7520.34 --> 7522.44]  default passwords cannot reference easy.
[7522.74 --> 7523.26]  Okay.
[7524.54 --> 7527.34]  They ban bad default passwords.
[7527.98 --> 7530.14]  That makes a decent amount of sense.
[7530.48 --> 7534.52]  Default passwords cannot reference easily discoverable information like Wi-Fi SSIDs,
[7534.60 --> 7537.14]  and they cannot be incremental versions of each other,
[7537.40 --> 7537.72]  i.e.
[7537.72 --> 7538.44]  password one,
[7538.56 --> 7539.14]  password two.
[7539.14 --> 7539.78]  Okay,
[7540.22 --> 7540.52]  neat.
[7540.88 --> 7541.16]  So,
[7541.32 --> 7543.52]  I would just like to say that I kind of hate this.
[7543.68 --> 7543.96]  Why?
[7544.14 --> 7545.58]  As a technical user,
[7546.00 --> 7551.48]  I really like it when my default password for everything that brand is just admin admin,
[7551.90 --> 7555.48]  because often I am resetting something multiple times,
[7555.48 --> 7560.58]  and going back and referring to the 14 random characters,
[7560.76 --> 7561.28]  uppercase,
[7561.38 --> 7561.78]  lowercase,
[7561.88 --> 7562.84]  special character thing,
[7562.94 --> 7565.62]  and entering that on my stupid phone,
[7565.62 --> 7571.32]  because my laptop that I'm using on site today is out of battery.
[7571.68 --> 7573.42]  I can understand how it's annoying.
[7573.56 --> 7576.42]  There are situations where this will be extremely annoying for me,
[7576.50 --> 7579.78]  but it is 100% the right thing to do.
[7579.88 --> 7580.04]  Yeah.
[7580.64 --> 7581.06]  Yeah,
[7581.06 --> 7584.68]  it'll be annoying for probably a lot of the people watching right now.
[7584.68 --> 7588.96]  Literally dozens of us will be infuriated by this.
[7589.28 --> 7590.34]  But it's better for the whole.
[7590.82 --> 7591.58]  But it's,
[7591.94 --> 7592.22]  well,
[7592.26 --> 7593.32]  here's my problem though,
[7593.32 --> 7597.22]  is a lot of devices are only ever going to be set up by a professional.
[7597.94 --> 7598.28]  Nah.
[7599.30 --> 7599.78]  Nah.
[7600.24 --> 7601.56]  Like a server or something?
[7601.66 --> 7602.06]  Come on.
[7602.48 --> 7603.66]  Like ubiquity equipment?
[7605.24 --> 7605.68]  No,
[7605.84 --> 7606.10]  no,
[7606.46 --> 7609.38]  no casual is going to set up a ubiquity access point.
[7609.38 --> 7609.40]  Yeah,
[7609.40 --> 7613.04]  but I think the ubiquity access points are going to be a pretty small percentage of these things.
[7613.20 --> 7615.34]  I think they're talking about like Wi-Fi routers and stuff.
[7615.50 --> 7616.84]  But what about me?
[7618.90 --> 7619.46]  I mean,
[7619.54 --> 7622.62]  an access point is basically a Wi-Fi router in a colloquial sense.
[7622.62 --> 7622.92]  You know,
[7622.92 --> 7624.92]  I would be okay with it,
[7624.96 --> 7627.70]  with the idea that this only applied to consumer electronics.
[7627.70 --> 7628.18]  Actually,
[7628.26 --> 7631.58]  if it didn't apply to like enterprise grade stuff,
[7631.60 --> 7632.76]  I'd be fine with that personally.
[7633.08 --> 7633.28]  Yeah,
[7633.30 --> 7633.72]  screw it.
[7634.36 --> 7635.72]  You should probably set your stuff up properly.
[7635.90 --> 7636.10]  Whatever.
[7636.38 --> 7636.58]  Yeah.
[7637.30 --> 7637.50]  Yeah.
[7637.56 --> 7637.84]  I,
[7637.90 --> 7638.12]  I,
[7638.12 --> 7638.98]  they won't do it that way,
[7639.02 --> 7639.66]  but that would be fine.
[7639.84 --> 7640.02]  I,
[7640.08 --> 7640.70]  I would be,
[7640.82 --> 7643.30]  I would be so much happier with that,
[7643.42 --> 7644.26]  but no,
[7644.32 --> 7644.60]  you're right.
[7644.64 --> 7645.46]  They probably won't do it.
[7645.62 --> 7649.84]  Another thing that I know you're really happy about is that Walmart has come to Roblox.
[7649.84 --> 7658.68]  Walmart is piloting a store on Roblox where players can buy a physical item alongside its digital in-game twin.
[7659.36 --> 7663.56]  The Walmart discovered experience is currently only available in the U.S.
[7663.56 --> 7671.88]  children over 13 can make purchases so long if they've verified their age by sending Roblox a picture of their government issued ID,
[7672.28 --> 7673.94]  as well as adding their name,
[7674.32 --> 7674.76]  address,
[7674.92 --> 7678.44]  and credit card information to the Roblox based Walmart store.
[7679.12 --> 7685.62]  Walmart previously attempted to appeal to children through Roblox by adding two previous experiences,
[7686.18 --> 7688.94]  Walmart land and Walmart's universe of play.
[7688.94 --> 7689.46]  However,
[7689.46 --> 7693.86]  this was met with backlash as Walmart failed to properly disclose that these games,
[7693.96 --> 7694.72]  uh,
[7694.80 --> 7696.10]  were also advertisements.
[7696.78 --> 7698.16]  That was really loud through the mic,
[7698.24 --> 7698.42]  by the way.
[7698.44 --> 7699.08]  So the reason I,
[7699.18 --> 7699.32]  oh,
[7699.42 --> 7699.60]  sorry.
[7699.84 --> 7704.24]  So the reason I brought my phone up just now was to check if I still had the notification for it,
[7704.34 --> 7705.42]  because I was going to show you.
[7706.60 --> 7710.64]  My son requested to install Roblox earlier this week.
[7710.78 --> 7710.86]  Look,
[7710.86 --> 7712.24]  look,
[7712.38 --> 7712.74]  I,
[7712.94 --> 7713.58]  the two,
[7713.64 --> 7714.68]  he's done both of them now.
[7714.80 --> 7716.82]  I approved Fortnite two weeks ago,
[7716.88 --> 7718.82]  which he's been enjoying a lot.
[7718.90 --> 7719.06]  I,
[7719.12 --> 7719.78]  I had the,
[7719.88 --> 7720.62]  I had the,
[7720.62 --> 7724.10]  I had the microtransaction conversation with him again.
[7724.10 --> 7724.62]  I was like,
[7724.66 --> 7725.02]  I was like,
[7725.08 --> 7725.32]  look,
[7725.80 --> 7726.06]  okay,
[7726.08 --> 7731.14]  you're going to see a lot of your friends are going to have a lot of like paid items and skins and stuff in these,
[7731.26 --> 7731.74]  in these,
[7731.82 --> 7732.40]  in this game.
[7732.96 --> 7733.40]  Um,
[7733.58 --> 7734.06]  okay.
[7734.68 --> 7734.96]  What,
[7735.00 --> 7735.44]  what are,
[7735.58 --> 7736.16]  what are they?
[7736.36 --> 7737.36]  He's like suckers.
[7737.44 --> 7737.82]  And I'm like,
[7737.94 --> 7738.16]  good,
[7738.90 --> 7739.38]  good boy.
[7739.38 --> 7740.38]  Um,
[7740.52 --> 7742.10]  I don't know how long that'll last,
[7742.20 --> 7742.64]  but boy,
[7742.68 --> 7744.30]  am I ever going to try and keep that mentality?
[7744.30 --> 7745.22]  Because to be clear,
[7745.28 --> 7745.60]  guys,
[7746.80 --> 7747.58]  what I'm doing right now,
[7747.60 --> 7747.86]  I don't,
[7747.92 --> 7749.82]  I don't actually think that's necessarily true.
[7749.88 --> 7755.54]  I think there's lots of good reasons that you could contribute towards a piece of software that you really enjoy.
[7755.62 --> 7756.64]  Developers need to be paid.
[7756.70 --> 7757.78]  I'm not going to make that argument.
[7758.04 --> 7760.44]  A lot of people have bad relationships with this.
[7760.44 --> 7766.82]  The issue is that Fortnite is designed to be a money sucking machine,
[7766.82 --> 7771.48]  and it is designed to prey on people who have,
[7772.10 --> 7775.38]  who are either young and immature or who have,
[7775.38 --> 7776.04]  um,
[7776.70 --> 7780.06]  an unhealthy relationship with these kinds of transactions.
[7780.06 --> 7783.14]  And so what I am doing is I am,
[7783.24 --> 7785.50]  I am setting the bar here,
[7785.50 --> 7787.04]  right?
[7787.40 --> 7790.84]  Knowing that probably he will land here instead of,
[7790.92 --> 7791.28]  and this is,
[7791.32 --> 7791.80]  this is a hope,
[7791.86 --> 7791.98]  right?
[7791.98 --> 7792.12]  Like,
[7792.14 --> 7793.64]  I don't know if this parenting strategy works,
[7793.64 --> 7797.74]  but instead of setting the bar here and then,
[7797.94 --> 7798.32]  you know,
[7798.68 --> 7800.04]  Oh dear Lord,
[7800.12 --> 7800.30]  you know,
[7800.34 --> 7801.16]  he fell down here.
[7801.16 --> 7802.68]  So I'm basically setting a very,
[7802.82 --> 7804.22]  very high level of expectations.
[7804.22 --> 7808.34]  So if we ever do spend money on a Fortnite skin or something like that,
[7808.44 --> 7811.36]  the understanding will be that this is an exception.
[7811.56 --> 7811.86]  This is very,
[7812.00 --> 7812.64]  this is special.
[7812.84 --> 7814.32]  This is something very special.
[7814.64 --> 7815.32]  Merry Christmas.
[7815.32 --> 7817.82]  You got one skin or something along those lines.
[7817.94 --> 7822.02]  I think the only thing you risk with that is when they,
[7822.12 --> 7826.18]  when they become free and they seek the thing that was restricted more.
[7826.32 --> 7827.18]  Sometimes it can swoop.
[7828.06 --> 7828.26]  Yeah,
[7828.32 --> 7828.72]  that's true.
[7829.00 --> 7829.74]  But that's true.
[7829.82 --> 7831.14]  I don't think it will in this case.
[7831.56 --> 7832.00]  Um,
[7832.96 --> 7833.16]  I,
[7833.24 --> 7833.48]  yeah,
[7833.48 --> 7833.84]  his,
[7833.92 --> 7834.22]  his,
[7834.32 --> 7841.98]  his opinion on what games he liked used to be so incredibly based and now it is becoming not so.
[7842.34 --> 7843.50]  And that makes me sad.
[7843.60 --> 7843.74]  Yeah,
[7843.76 --> 7844.04]  I know,
[7844.22 --> 7845.00]  but it's okay.
[7845.04 --> 7845.34]  That's fine.
[7845.36 --> 7846.18]  We'll draw him back into it.
[7846.20 --> 7847.52]  I still haven't shown him Warcraft three.
[7847.76 --> 7849.16]  Kids are going to kid sometimes.
[7849.36 --> 7849.62]  Oh yeah.
[7849.64 --> 7851.52]  And like realistically gaming is social.
[7851.76 --> 7852.18]  That's true.
[7852.28 --> 7852.36]  Well,
[7852.36 --> 7853.72]  his friends are playing it.
[7853.82 --> 7854.38]  It is what it is.
[7854.44 --> 7854.58]  Yeah.
[7854.64 --> 7855.06]  A hundred percent.
[7855.18 --> 7855.62]  I agree.
[7855.84 --> 7856.20]  I just,
[7856.32 --> 7857.02]  it just sucks.
[7857.42 --> 7857.82]  Um,
[7857.90 --> 7862.80]  one thing that I think is pretty funny about this Walmart thing is I can pretty much guarantee you that somebody
[7862.80 --> 7868.12]  somewhere is going to complain that you have to buy a physical item in order to get a digital one.
[7868.12 --> 7879.70]  What I think is so funny because we get comments complaining that you have to buy something from LTT store to get a merch message in because they would rather just send in money and receive nothing.
[7879.70 --> 7884.36]  And I just think that's so crazy that I know someone is going to be like,
[7884.44 --> 7886.10]  I just wanted the digital headphones.
[7886.20 --> 7887.42]  I didn't want the real headphones.
[7887.74 --> 7891.18]  I wanted to play a full headphone dollars for digital headphones,
[7891.26 --> 7891.86]  not real ones.
[7892.00 --> 7893.18]  That's going to happen.
[7893.60 --> 7894.54]  Someone's going to do it.
[7897.24 --> 7897.80]  I mean,
[7897.84 --> 7898.26]  in fairness,
[7898.50 --> 7900.22]  if they don't need another pair of headphones,
[7900.34 --> 7901.62]  I kind of see where they're coming from.
[7901.80 --> 7902.72]  Just give them to your friend or something.
[7902.86 --> 7905.08]  Or you could just not need the digital headphones too.
[7905.14 --> 7905.94]  That's also an option.
[7906.02 --> 7906.38]  That's a,
[7906.44 --> 7907.38]  that's a better idea.
[7907.38 --> 7908.56]  I mean,
[7908.56 --> 7909.34]  this is really smart.
[7910.24 --> 7911.66]  You got to give credit where it's due.
[7911.76 --> 7912.12]  This is,
[7912.20 --> 7912.96]  this is super smart.
[7913.08 --> 7914.60]  They're definitely going to move some units.
[7916.46 --> 7917.20]  I just,
[7917.50 --> 7919.86]  it's exhausting.
[7920.38 --> 7922.70]  I think that's the only real word that I can use for it.
[7922.72 --> 7923.76]  It's just exhausting.
[7923.76 --> 7926.88]  Like all the new and creative ways that we can be marketed to.
[7927.12 --> 7929.14]  Billions of dollars going into controlling your brain.
[7929.22 --> 7929.54]  Like dude,
[7929.62 --> 7929.94]  there is,
[7930.04 --> 7931.40]  there is so much stuff.
[7931.40 --> 7932.36]  That's just like,
[7932.88 --> 7936.50]  like obvious stuff that LTT store could do in order to sell more.
[7936.50 --> 7940.38]  Like immediately sell more like goofy stuff.
[7940.38 --> 7941.22]  Like when we did our,
[7941.34 --> 7942.90]  when we did that video on sports tech,
[7942.90 --> 7946.84]  so like tech that's branded with sports team logos and stuff like that,
[7946.84 --> 7947.48]  man,
[7947.56 --> 7954.14]  the site that runs most of that stuff in the U S is just every stupid mind game
[7954.14 --> 7955.64]  is front and center on their site.
[7955.64 --> 7958.76]  Like right now with only four hours left,
[7958.76 --> 7960.32]  it's the ultimate sale.
[7960.48 --> 7961.54]  Big ball sale.
[7963.54 --> 7963.94]  No,
[7964.04 --> 7964.70]  it's not.
[7964.92 --> 7966.70]  You're just going to start a new sale.
[7967.48 --> 7967.94]  Like fake,
[7968.04 --> 7970.66]  fake low stock information where they'll try to blast.
[7970.66 --> 7971.04]  Oh yeah.
[7971.22 --> 7972.80]  Like going out of business left.
[7972.94 --> 7973.32]  Two left.
[7973.42 --> 7973.56]  Yeah.
[7973.72 --> 7973.88]  Yeah.
[7973.92 --> 7974.22]  Man.
[7974.30 --> 7974.70]  Oh man.
[7974.70 --> 7978.36]  What is it with mattress stores and being going out of business for like 10
[7978.36 --> 7978.62]  years?
[7978.74 --> 7979.08]  There's,
[7979.16 --> 7981.28]  there's one on King George Boulevard that the,
[7981.28 --> 7983.20]  the going out of business signage is faded.
[7983.58 --> 7983.78]  Yeah.
[7984.10 --> 7984.34]  Like,
[7984.38 --> 7984.60]  are you,
[7984.66 --> 7985.46]  you're not kidding.
[7985.50 --> 7986.72]  You're not fooling anybody.
[7986.82 --> 7987.70]  What is this?
[7988.84 --> 7990.30]  LTT store.com and Roblox.
[7990.36 --> 7990.56]  I mean,
[7990.98 --> 7991.32]  you know what?
[7991.36 --> 7991.56]  I'd be,
[7991.58 --> 7992.02]  I'd be down.
[7992.10 --> 7995.14]  I'd be down to do like a WAN hoodie that you can wear in your video game.
[7995.14 --> 7995.92]  And also you get a,
[7996.00 --> 7996.16]  you know,
[7996.22 --> 7997.90]  real life WAN hoodie or something like that.
[7998.22 --> 7998.46]  I,
[7998.68 --> 7999.54]  I don't,
[7999.66 --> 8002.00]  I don't see that as inherently bad.
[8002.00 --> 8002.46]  I'm just,
[8002.58 --> 8005.80]  I'm just kind of tired of having things shoved down my throat this hard.
[8006.08 --> 8007.38]  And it feels like a,
[8007.38 --> 8009.52]  it feels like a lot of people feel that way.
[8010.28 --> 8013.06]  Speaking of having ads shoved down your throat.
[8013.22 --> 8015.98]  I just thought that I just thought this was kind of interesting.
[8016.44 --> 8018.12]  The judge in the U S department,
[8018.40 --> 8021.72]  the U S department of justice is antitrust case against Google is currently
[8021.72 --> 8025.18]  hearing closing arguments as to whether Google's market dominance has
[8025.18 --> 8026.78]  harmed the quality of search.
[8027.70 --> 8028.18]  Spoiler.
[8028.84 --> 8029.32]  Yes.
[8029.88 --> 8031.44]  The heart of the DOJ's case,
[8031.44 --> 8034.20]  is Google's deals with various companies,
[8034.36 --> 8037.04]  ensuring that Google search would be the default on their platforms.
[8037.18 --> 8037.76]  In particular,
[8037.90 --> 8038.98]  Google's deal with Apple,
[8039.16 --> 8045.16]  a witness revealed during this trial that Google pays Apple 36% of its
[8045.16 --> 8049.08]  search advertising revenue from Safari in order to remain the default
[8049.08 --> 8050.70]  search tool on the browser.
[8051.00 --> 8052.24]  In just 2022,
[8052.58 --> 8055.42]  this deal resulted in Google paying $20 billion to Apple.
[8056.14 --> 8060.40]  Android manufacturers typically get around 12% of this revenue for their own
[8060.40 --> 8061.62]  default agreements with Google.
[8061.62 --> 8063.02]  So one third as much.
[8063.02 --> 8069.02]  this is not news necessarily.
[8069.66 --> 8071.42]  So the closing arguments are happening now,
[8071.48 --> 8072.96]  but a lot of this has come out earlier.
[8072.96 --> 8077.08]  But one of the things that struck me about this was that it is always
[8077.08 --> 8080.36]  interesting to me to see the,
[8080.36 --> 8081.42]  the,
[8081.42 --> 8081.46]  the,
[8081.46 --> 8081.74]  the,
[8081.74 --> 8084.86]  the shapes that Apple apologists,
[8085.18 --> 8086.12]  Apple loyalists,
[8086.34 --> 8087.44]  whatever you want to call them,
[8087.52 --> 8087.98]  fans,
[8088.14 --> 8088.42]  right?
[8088.54 --> 8088.80]  Fans.
[8088.88 --> 8090.10]  You shouldn't be a fan of anything.
[8090.10 --> 8090.60]  Um,
[8090.60 --> 8094.52]  but that Apple fans will contort themselves into,
[8094.52 --> 8101.58]  to frame Apple as a totally different kind of entity compared to the other big tech companies.
[8101.58 --> 8102.40]  And this one,
[8102.74 --> 8103.10]  this one,
[8103.10 --> 8105.60]  what stood out to me about this was,
[8105.60 --> 8106.10]  um,
[8106.10 --> 8110.44]  it reminded me of that conversation that we had a little while back about the VPN
[8110.44 --> 8112.56]  industry and how sort of,
[8112.64 --> 8112.86]  you know,
[8113.08 --> 8119.22]  how our comfort level is high enough to have VPN sponsors and talk about the
[8119.22 --> 8120.68]  benefits of VPN to our audience.
[8120.68 --> 8126.72]  But our comfort level is not high enough to run our own VPN and personally say,
[8126.86 --> 8127.36]  no,
[8127.48 --> 8133.16]  I understand that that IP is downloading illicit harmful material.
[8133.76 --> 8134.20]  Um,
[8134.98 --> 8135.28]  you know,
[8135.28 --> 8135.54]  it's,
[8135.54 --> 8136.96]  it's affecting real people,
[8137.12 --> 8137.28]  you know,
[8137.32 --> 8137.92]  real miners.
[8137.92 --> 8139.38]  And we are not going to give you,
[8139.48 --> 8141.04]  we're not going to give you that person's information.
[8141.04 --> 8142.86]  That's just beyond Bynum Luke's comfort zone.
[8142.92 --> 8143.92]  We're not going to say no to that.
[8143.96 --> 8148.26]  So we're just not going to run a VPN because you can't have a VPN that just decides
[8148.26 --> 8150.66]  sometimes to disclose its users.
[8150.68 --> 8151.68]  Um,
[8152.68 --> 8154.38]  activities and sometimes doesn't.
[8154.88 --> 8155.22]  Um,
[8155.22 --> 8155.76]  but what I,
[8155.86 --> 8158.86]  it reminded me of that conversation because I was looking at this going,
[8159.00 --> 8163.84]  how can Apple and Apple's users look at each other,
[8163.84 --> 8164.56]  you know,
[8164.78 --> 8166.36]  across the table and go,
[8166.54 --> 8170.14]  I am so protective of your privacy.
[8170.14 --> 8173.74]  I care so much about it that it is central to basically all my product
[8173.74 --> 8174.14]  messaging.
[8174.90 --> 8180.56]  And for you to sit there and believe that while I am collecting $20 billion a
[8180.56 --> 8180.98]  year,
[8181.18 --> 8181.56]  yeah,
[8181.56 --> 8189.40]  through Google's efforts to harvest your data and sell ads against that
[8189.40 --> 8191.28]  personalized collected data.
[8191.36 --> 8191.48]  I mean,
[8191.52 --> 8196.56]  Apple's conflict of interest here is so obvious and so clear and so brazen
[8196.56 --> 8198.24]  brazen that I just,
[8198.48 --> 8199.04]  I don't know.
[8199.08 --> 8199.32]  I just,
[8199.40 --> 8199.98]  I find it,
[8200.28 --> 8203.80]  I find it exhausting that it isn't obvious to everyone else.
[8203.80 --> 8205.78]  And I think that's become a bit of a problem for me.
[8207.32 --> 8208.96]  Like I end up with people,
[8209.12 --> 8212.96]  with people looking at my takes and kind of going like,
[8212.96 --> 8213.26]  yeah,
[8213.38 --> 8213.68]  Linus,
[8213.94 --> 8215.60]  Linus hates Apple or he,
[8215.76 --> 8217.04]  or he hates this or,
[8217.12 --> 8217.58]  or he,
[8218.14 --> 8218.70]  whatever,
[8218.86 --> 8219.94]  whatever he thinks about,
[8220.04 --> 8220.80]  about something.
[8221.14 --> 8222.46]  And I think part of it is,
[8222.50 --> 8222.64]  yeah,
[8222.70 --> 8222.84]  I'm,
[8222.84 --> 8223.42]  I'm just,
[8223.88 --> 8228.02]  I'm exhausted of having the same conversations over and over again.
[8228.44 --> 8228.88]  And,
[8229.00 --> 8229.28]  you know,
[8229.32 --> 8229.72]  I've,
[8229.72 --> 8230.58]  I've said this before,
[8230.70 --> 8232.34]  I guess I'll do it one more time.
[8232.34 --> 8236.30]  The thing that drives me most crazy about Apple is the utter hypocrisy of it,
[8236.30 --> 8238.20]  of their behavior that they,
[8238.32 --> 8247.72]  that they will put a microsite up on their website about how much they're saving the planet as they actively send tens of thousands of working devices to,
[8247.72 --> 8248.50]  uh,
[8248.56 --> 8251.54]  to a destroyer like Geep,
[8251.82 --> 8252.08]  Jeep,
[8252.20 --> 8253.10]  however you pronounce it,
[8253.16 --> 8254.08]  G E E P.
[8254.20 --> 8255.50]  There was a whole lawsuit that Apple,
[8255.62 --> 8264.02]  I think ultimately dropped because they didn't like the publicity they were getting around pursuing these guys for ultimately not destroying this working hardware.
[8264.14 --> 8264.62]  It was a whole thing.
[8264.72 --> 8265.68]  This was a little while back.
[8266.30 --> 8266.78]  Um,
[8267.56 --> 8268.62]  I'm not just a hater.
[8269.16 --> 8269.48]  This is,
[8269.58 --> 8270.44]  this is not hate.
[8270.72 --> 8271.32]  This is,
[8271.62 --> 8274.64]  this is looking at the pieces in motion,
[8275.20 --> 8277.42]  looking at the actions they're taking and going,
[8277.84 --> 8281.52]  is this not obvious to everyone?
[8281.80 --> 8283.60]  Like you can still like Apple products,
[8283.66 --> 8284.88]  you still buy a fucking iPhone.
[8284.98 --> 8285.58]  I don't care.
[8286.84 --> 8287.70]  That's your money.
[8287.82 --> 8288.70]  You do whatever you want.
[8288.82 --> 8289.82]  Just know what's happening.
[8290.08 --> 8290.92]  But why,
[8291.18 --> 8292.96]  why do you insist?
[8293.60 --> 8296.14]  Why do you insist on not seeing it?
[8296.30 --> 8297.20]  For what it is.
[8298.14 --> 8298.54]  And I just,
[8298.62 --> 8299.86]  I don't know how to address it.
[8300.24 --> 8300.84]  Like seeing,
[8301.08 --> 8301.78]  seeing the,
[8301.82 --> 8308.08]  the antitrust developments between the U S government and Apple and all the articles that are on sort of the usual,
[8308.08 --> 8308.84]  uh,
[8308.84 --> 8312.00]  news sites that kind of have that traditional article comment format.
[8312.00 --> 8312.50]  I,
[8312.50 --> 8313.50]  I read a lot of comments,
[8313.50 --> 8314.90]  not just on our own videos,
[8315.00 --> 8316.00]  not just on videos.
[8316.48 --> 8316.86]  Um,
[8316.86 --> 8317.82]  a lot of the time I'll,
[8317.82 --> 8319.52]  I'll skim the article and I'll read the comments.
[8319.52 --> 8321.74]  I read a lot faster than I watch video though.
[8321.78 --> 8324.52]  So I usually will just read an article because I'm a pretty fast reader.
[8325.06 --> 8325.46]  Um,
[8325.56 --> 8325.88]  but,
[8325.96 --> 8326.70]  but going through,
[8326.78 --> 8327.50]  going through the articles,
[8327.60 --> 8328.06]  it's amazing.
[8328.06 --> 8337.86]  Even on communities where generally I have found that the readers are of above average savviness.
[8338.08 --> 8339.20]  Like Ars Technica,
[8339.34 --> 8342.22]  I would say is an example of a site where generally speaking,
[8342.22 --> 8345.88]  it's pretty hard to get upvoted if you're a complete idiot.
[8345.88 --> 8349.12]  Like it just doesn't really happen compared to a site like,
[8349.60 --> 8349.82]  uh,
[8349.82 --> 8352.44]  like the verge is a more normie site,
[8352.44 --> 8356.92]  but still reasonably savvy compared to,
[8357.56 --> 8357.92]  um,
[8357.94 --> 8358.60]  I don't know that,
[8358.70 --> 8361.12]  that dumb one that we were showing all the AI comments on a little,
[8361.22 --> 8361.44]  actually,
[8361.54 --> 8361.68]  no,
[8361.78 --> 8362.50]  that one wasn't bad.
[8362.82 --> 8363.14]  Um,
[8363.16 --> 8363.54]  but anyway,
[8363.54 --> 8367.46]  the point is I would say Ars Technica is one that has a pretty high,
[8367.58 --> 8370.38]  high standard of viewership or readership.
[8370.82 --> 8375.86]  And I was going through one of the articles on this and the number of people,
[8375.88 --> 8377.16]  people that were making the,
[8377.42 --> 8378.96]  but my walled garden,
[8379.06 --> 8380.26]  I love it better in here.
[8380.80 --> 8383.52]  Argument just blew me away.
[8385.04 --> 8388.60]  Then have your walled garden.
[8389.20 --> 8390.74]  You can choose those options.
[8391.00 --> 8391.84]  Stay in it.
[8392.18 --> 8392.46]  Yeah.
[8392.86 --> 8393.92]  It's okay.
[8394.12 --> 8395.04]  You can close the door.
[8395.32 --> 8396.88]  Competition is good.
[8397.16 --> 8399.48]  That is a universal truth.
[8399.48 --> 8405.82]  And you will not be able to argue that point with any degree of success against anyone who,
[8405.88 --> 8411.26]  isn't a complete NPC competition breeds innovation.
[8411.26 --> 8413.90]  It just does.
[8414.66 --> 8418.90]  And companies that are not forced to compete will abuse.
[8419.56 --> 8421.08]  They're okay.
[8421.08 --> 8422.96]  Let's not say monopolistic because that's,
[8423.02 --> 8423.96]  that's a big part of the argument.
[8424.10 --> 8424.22]  So you,
[8424.28 --> 8424.38]  um,
[8424.38 --> 8424.56]  um,
[8424.56 --> 8425.52]  Apple isn't a monopoly.
[8425.62 --> 8426.22]  They're not a monopoly.
[8426.32 --> 8426.64]  Look at that.
[8426.64 --> 8430.26]  You don't have to be a monopoly.
[8430.58 --> 8431.06]  Mono.
[8431.12 --> 8434.78]  You don't have to be just one to engage in anti-competitive behavior.
[8435.12 --> 8436.22]  You can be a local,
[8436.68 --> 8441.68]  you could be a regional ISP that is stomping out even smaller competitors.
[8441.68 --> 8444.40]  You are still engaging in anti-competitive behavior.
[8444.40 --> 8447.66]  Even if there's half a dozen other ISPs in the country.
[8447.66 --> 8447.88]  It's,
[8447.94 --> 8448.86]  that's not the point,
[8448.86 --> 8449.64]  right?
[8449.76 --> 8450.82]  That there's just one.
[8451.34 --> 8451.52]  Um,
[8451.52 --> 8451.90]  and it just,
[8451.98 --> 8456.66]  it just blows me away how polarizing this is and how emotional people's arguments are about it.
[8456.66 --> 8459.18]  When I just don't get it.
[8459.28 --> 8460.36]  Don't be a fan.
[8461.82 --> 8463.58]  Don't be a fan of Apple.
[8463.66 --> 8468.28]  Don't be a fan of Intel or Nvidia or Microsoft or any of these companies.
[8468.94 --> 8469.50]  I mean,
[8469.52 --> 8470.06]  look at man,
[8470.14 --> 8473.34]  look at the way the tech industry has handled layoffs lately.
[8473.44 --> 8473.66]  Have you,
[8473.74 --> 8475.34]  have you seen the supercharger team layoffs?
[8475.34 --> 8476.42]  They're just like,
[8476.72 --> 8476.82]  yeah,
[8476.88 --> 8477.80]  Tesla supercharger teams.
[8478.34 --> 8478.90]  See you later.
[8479.18 --> 8479.36]  Oh,
[8479.68 --> 8480.28]  nice knowing you.
[8481.24 --> 8481.64]  Um,
[8482.08 --> 8483.36]  I always like going to that,
[8483.46 --> 8483.78]  that,
[8483.96 --> 8484.24]  uh,
[8484.24 --> 8485.52]  website layoffs.fyi.
[8486.18 --> 8486.90]  It's interesting.
[8487.32 --> 8487.48]  Yeah,
[8487.48 --> 8487.64]  here,
[8487.68 --> 8488.38]  I'm going to your laptop.
[8488.58 --> 8488.72]  Yeah.
[8489.96 --> 8491.28]  In 2024 alone,
[8491.40 --> 8495.82]  279 tech companies have laid off 80,230 employees.
[8500.72 --> 8503.08]  As soon as you're publicly traded by definition,
[8503.08 --> 8504.58]  you can't have a soul.
[8505.34 --> 8505.74]  Yeah.
[8508.74 --> 8509.14]  Yeah.
[8509.14 --> 8509.50]  It's brutal.
[8509.76 --> 8510.12]  You can,
[8510.22 --> 8511.84]  if you poke through this website for a while,
[8512.18 --> 8512.82]  um,
[8512.96 --> 8513.86]  you can,
[8514.30 --> 8514.80]  uh,
[8514.80 --> 8515.32]  I don't know.
[8515.48 --> 8517.02]  I don't remember exactly how to do it.
[8517.06 --> 8517.36]  It's,
[8517.44 --> 8519.40]  it's intuitive once you actually start using it,
[8519.40 --> 8520.62]  but there's a way to,
[8520.62 --> 8521.38]  uh,
[8521.38 --> 8523.14]  sort by like type of company,
[8523.14 --> 8524.08]  uh,
[8524.08 --> 8525.00]  because it shows like,
[8525.06 --> 8526.28]  like fintech companies,
[8526.38 --> 8527.58]  all this other type of stuff in there,
[8527.58 --> 8528.00]  but you can,
[8528.06 --> 8529.98]  you can narrow it down to different specifics,
[8529.98 --> 8530.86]  but it's,
[8530.86 --> 8532.64]  it's a lot of people.
[8535.38 --> 8536.26]  Avon Fox says,
[8536.32 --> 8537.16]  if we don't want fans,
[8537.26 --> 8538.22]  stop calling them team red,
[8538.30 --> 8538.64]  team blue,
[8538.74 --> 8539.04]  et cetera.
[8539.04 --> 8539.74]  That's a good point.
[8540.08 --> 8540.42]  Um,
[8540.82 --> 8541.42]  and you know what?
[8541.50 --> 8542.30]  That's one of the,
[8542.34 --> 8544.34]  that's one of the sort of insidious,
[8544.34 --> 8547.22]  subtle ways that,
[8547.76 --> 8548.12]  um,
[8548.20 --> 8548.38]  that,
[8548.50 --> 8550.40]  that they do turn gamers against each other.
[8550.44 --> 8551.78]  Like as far as I remember,
[8551.88 --> 8553.68]  AMD started that whole team red thing.
[8554.34 --> 8555.00]  I think so.
[8555.04 --> 8563.06]  I think that was back in the bulldozer days when basically they didn't have any product worth buying and all they could count on was selling to fans.
[8563.06 --> 8564.02]  And you know what?
[8564.06 --> 8564.56]  This is tough,
[8564.60 --> 8564.74]  right?
[8564.78 --> 8569.98]  Because if absolutely everybody bought only the objectively best product,
[8570.98 --> 8574.12]  companies would just cease to exist.
[8574.12 --> 8575.66]  The second monopolies instantly,
[8575.88 --> 8576.38]  instantly.
[8576.64 --> 8578.82]  And so the fact that the fact that,
[8578.82 --> 8579.10]  you know,
[8579.12 --> 8580.80]  people that I would no offense,
[8580.94 --> 8587.48]  but like laugh at behind closed doors who are buying these like objectively worse products for the same price,
[8587.50 --> 8587.70]  right?
[8587.70 --> 8588.06]  Like I,
[8588.48 --> 8588.62]  I,
[8588.68 --> 8589.26]  I'm sorry,
[8589.26 --> 8589.80]  I'm sorry,
[8589.80 --> 8591.08]  but I think you're a clown.
[8591.44 --> 8595.30]  If you know that one thing is objectively better than the other one and you buy,
[8595.66 --> 8598.72]  you buy the worst one because it has a brand you like on it.
[8598.72 --> 8599.06]  I'm sorry.
[8599.14 --> 8599.66]  You're a clown.
[8599.92 --> 8601.36]  I do think sometimes,
[8601.50 --> 8602.34]  but they saved AMD.
[8602.34 --> 8602.42]  AMD.
[8602.78 --> 8610.84]  The fact that we have AMD today is because absolute clowns were fans of a company and bought a brand instead of a product.
[8610.90 --> 8611.28]  I was like,
[8611.40 --> 8612.26]  you know what?
[8612.32 --> 8612.86]  Thank you.
[8613.00 --> 8613.46]  Thank you.
[8614.36 --> 8616.50]  I actually enjoy living in clown world.
[8616.50 --> 8618.12]  Cause if we had just Intel,
[8618.26 --> 8620.28]  I do think you're oversimplifying.
[8620.44 --> 8621.36]  We'd still have four cores,
[8621.50 --> 8621.60]  Luke.
[8621.60 --> 8623.08]  Cause some people just don't care enough.
[8623.28 --> 8624.42]  We'd still have four cores.
[8624.78 --> 8625.96]  So they're not going to do the research.
[8627.32 --> 8628.86]  So if it's just going to be on sale and they're like,
[8628.92 --> 8629.10]  whatever,
[8629.20 --> 8630.38]  I need a functioning computer.
[8630.50 --> 8631.14]  I don't really care.
[8631.22 --> 8631.70]  And you know what?
[8631.74 --> 8632.34]  That's fine.
[8632.52 --> 8632.74]  Yeah,
[8632.94 --> 8633.50]  that's fine.
[8633.58 --> 8634.66]  And then other people might have,
[8634.66 --> 8635.72]  but I didn't talk about that.
[8635.94 --> 8638.74]  Other people might have subjective reasons why they like or dislike something.
[8638.74 --> 8643.12]  And other people might have reasons why they're doing an anything but purchasing.
[8643.38 --> 8644.88]  I can address all of these.
[8644.98 --> 8645.20]  Okay.
[8645.42 --> 8645.66]  All right.
[8645.70 --> 8645.86]  Okay.
[8645.86 --> 8646.44]  So number one,
[8646.50 --> 8647.56]  I wasn't talking about that.
[8648.38 --> 8649.24]  Out of ignorance,
[8649.60 --> 8652.22]  I will absolutely buy the wrong brand of drill bit.
[8652.32 --> 8652.52]  Sure.
[8652.70 --> 8653.34]  It happens.
[8654.12 --> 8657.90]  I don't have the time to research absolutely everything in my life.
[8657.90 --> 8659.78]  And I understand that some people,
[8659.88 --> 8660.06]  in fact,
[8660.08 --> 8662.54]  I'm one of the people who talks about this all the time.
[8662.54 --> 8666.14]  Like we live in our little tech bubble where everything's obvious to us,
[8666.26 --> 8666.76]  you know,
[8666.82 --> 8668.32]  that this one is so much better than that one.
[8668.32 --> 8672.32]  How could anybody possibly buy a 4060 with only eight gigs of VRAM?
[8672.40 --> 8672.44]  Or,
[8672.52 --> 8672.78]  you know,
[8672.82 --> 8674.80]  whatever the thing we hate du jour is,
[8675.14 --> 8675.38]  you know,
[8675.50 --> 8677.12]  I talk about that all the time.
[8677.16 --> 8678.42]  How for most people,
[8678.42 --> 8681.34]  it's as simple as walking into a retail store and buying whatever the rep hands,
[8681.42 --> 8683.02]  then that happens to be within their price range.
[8683.08 --> 8683.68]  I get that.
[8684.40 --> 8686.04]  So I'm not talking about people who just,
[8686.12 --> 8686.90]  just don't know.
[8687.80 --> 8689.84]  And as for your second one,
[8690.18 --> 8690.90]  I forget what it was.
[8691.36 --> 8692.14]  It was good though.
[8692.70 --> 8693.18]  It was really good.
[8694.74 --> 8695.14]  Okay.
[8696.24 --> 8697.24]  So there was ignorance.
[8697.66 --> 8697.88]  Yeah.
[8698.32 --> 8699.10]  There was.
[8700.62 --> 8700.98]  Oh,
[8701.04 --> 8702.12]  just not caring preference.
[8702.32 --> 8702.84]  I think it was.
[8702.92 --> 8702.98]  No,
[8702.98 --> 8703.06]  no,
[8703.06 --> 8703.74]  that was the third one.
[8704.36 --> 8705.56]  I thought the third one,
[8705.60 --> 8706.74]  I can't put that finger.
[8706.74 --> 8706.86]  Yeah.
[8706.86 --> 8707.96]  The third one was anything,
[8708.12 --> 8708.88]  but the anything,
[8709.02 --> 8709.60]  but yes.
[8709.78 --> 8710.00]  Yeah.
[8710.06 --> 8710.36]  Okay.
[8710.40 --> 8710.72]  So,
[8710.92 --> 8711.56]  so the,
[8711.70 --> 8711.94]  so the,
[8712.02 --> 8712.88]  so the second one,
[8712.94 --> 8714.44]  I'm sorry,
[8714.44 --> 8714.92]  but I just,
[8715.02 --> 8717.60]  I just don't accept it with a computer processor.
[8717.60 --> 8720.16]  I can accept it with a water bottle.
[8720.16 --> 8721.44]  Because this is subjective.
[8721.78 --> 8723.36]  We were talking about like everything though.
[8723.46 --> 8725.36]  It wasn't just CPUs we were talking about.
[8725.44 --> 8725.62]  Okay.
[8725.68 --> 8727.98]  But I'm specifically talking about tech products right now though.
[8728.10 --> 8729.58]  And when it comes down to CPUs,
[8729.62 --> 8734.52]  there might still be preference because you might use a certain program or something that performs better in the other thing.
[8734.52 --> 8735.04]  But that's fine.
[8735.04 --> 8735.78]  And that's still objective.
[8736.08 --> 8738.96]  I'm just saying that a CPU is not a subjective purchase.
[8739.10 --> 8742.16]  But that comes down to potentially two products still being relevant.
[8742.86 --> 8744.22]  In those days it didn't.
[8744.38 --> 8744.88]  I agree.
[8745.02 --> 8745.16]  Yeah.
[8745.26 --> 8745.38]  No,
[8745.44 --> 8745.56]  that,
[8745.62 --> 8745.72]  no,
[8745.76 --> 8745.84]  no,
[8745.84 --> 8746.20]  that was,
[8746.26 --> 8747.72]  that was clown days of AMD.
[8747.92 --> 8748.16]  There was,
[8748.28 --> 8748.56]  you were,
[8748.70 --> 8748.98]  if you,
[8749.04 --> 8750.78]  if you paid full price for a bulldozer,
[8750.78 --> 8751.26]  you were,
[8751.38 --> 8754.44]  you were willfully ignorant basically.
[8754.68 --> 8754.86]  Yeah.
[8754.92 --> 8755.38]  Like those were,
[8755.44 --> 8756.00]  those were bad.
[8756.10 --> 8756.28]  You couldn't,
[8756.36 --> 8756.84]  it was a rough time.
[8757.10 --> 8757.98]  You couldn't look,
[8758.36 --> 8763.12]  even glance at the introduction of a review and not know that it was not dark times.
[8763.22 --> 8763.52]  It was,
[8763.64 --> 8763.78]  yeah.
[8763.78 --> 8764.86]  That it was dark times for AMD.
[8764.86 --> 8765.66]  I checked it through back then.
[8765.74 --> 8765.94]  It was,
[8766.04 --> 8766.68]  it was a sad,
[8766.94 --> 8767.68]  it was a sad time.
[8767.74 --> 8768.48]  As for the anything,
[8768.70 --> 8769.94]  but I get it.
[8770.38 --> 8774.42]  There are definitely companies that I have taken a break from before,
[8774.42 --> 8776.40]  but I also,
[8776.70 --> 8778.58]  I also think that that's kind of a,
[8778.58 --> 8779.00]  um,
[8780.86 --> 8788.00]  I know recently that there are people that have taken risks with purchasing decisions,
[8788.00 --> 8791.58]  especially in the GPU department because of some of the things that Nvidia has done.
[8791.58 --> 8796.30]  I don't necessarily think that that's super wrong.
[8797.30 --> 8798.20]  And that's fair.
[8799.24 --> 8805.42]  But what I will say is don't get stuck in like a place of sort of blind hatred forever.
[8805.84 --> 8806.22]  Yeah.
[8806.22 --> 8808.14]  because outside of,
[8808.14 --> 8808.48]  you know,
[8808.54 --> 8808.74]  very,
[8808.74 --> 8809.78]  employees are going to turn over.
[8809.90 --> 8810.22]  Things are going to change.
[8810.22 --> 8811.50]  Outside of very senior leadership,
[8812.14 --> 8814.00]  the company that you were buying from,
[8814.06 --> 8815.80]  if you're buying an AMD CPU today,
[8815.88 --> 8816.32]  for example,
[8816.32 --> 8818.48]  and I'm using AMD as an example for a reason,
[8818.48 --> 8821.48]  because they have had a significant amount of turnover in the last decade.
[8821.48 --> 8824.00]  If you buy an AMD CPU today,
[8824.00 --> 8828.26]  you are effectively buying it from a completely different company.
[8828.46 --> 8828.74]  Oh yeah.
[8828.82 --> 8830.44]  From who they were 10,
[8830.54 --> 8832.94]  especially like if you go back like 15 years ago,
[8833.06 --> 8834.18]  a hundred percent functionally,
[8834.66 --> 8838.40]  it's like they're the company of Theseus,
[8838.48 --> 8838.64]  right?
[8838.68 --> 8842.62]  Like almost every working part has been replaced in that time.
[8842.76 --> 8844.60]  A lot of companies are that way.
[8844.60 --> 8845.38]  So holding,
[8845.38 --> 8850.80]  so holding grudges against a brand is,
[8850.92 --> 8852.88]  is entirely silliness.
[8853.32 --> 8853.62]  Um,
[8853.62 --> 8856.46]  you should absolutely consider anything they've done recently.
[8856.46 --> 8860.38]  And if they have a long history of absolutely evil behavior,
[8860.38 --> 8863.82]  then that clearly is a deep rooted cultural issue.
[8863.82 --> 8864.26]  Like I,
[8864.56 --> 8865.20]  if someone were to say,
[8865.28 --> 8865.40]  look,
[8865.42 --> 8868.34]  I'll buy anything other than something made by Nestle.
[8869.30 --> 8870.04]  All right.
[8871.14 --> 8872.02]  Fair enough.
[8872.50 --> 8873.10]  Because,
[8873.20 --> 8873.50]  you know,
[8873.50 --> 8875.70]  whether you want to make an argument around like,
[8875.98 --> 8876.22]  you know,
[8876.28 --> 8879.66]  the privileged position that they're in today at all is because of the awful
[8879.66 --> 8882.30]  behavior that they have paid zero reparations for,
[8882.36 --> 8884.82]  or whether you want to look at their more recent actions,
[8884.96 --> 8887.88]  you'll have a strong argument for why you just shouldn't buy anything made by
[8887.88 --> 8888.20]  Nestle.
[8888.52 --> 8893.80]  But I think it'll be hard pressed to find a similar example in the tech space.
[8894.52 --> 8894.80]  Um,
[8895.56 --> 8896.98]  Nestle was a good call out though.
[8897.14 --> 8897.92]  I like it.
[8898.50 --> 8898.86]  Yeah.
[8898.94 --> 8899.08]  Well,
[8899.08 --> 8899.64]  they're just the,
[8899.64 --> 8902.12]  the most obviously evil company other than what,
[8902.20 --> 8902.92]  like maybe Chiquita.
[8903.50 --> 8904.08]  Like I,
[8904.30 --> 8904.70]  who's that?
[8904.82 --> 8905.92]  That's the banana company.
[8906.08 --> 8906.56]  Oh yeah.
[8906.66 --> 8906.84]  Yeah.
[8906.84 --> 8907.02]  Yeah.
[8907.02 --> 8907.26]  Yeah.
[8907.26 --> 8907.46]  Yeah.
[8907.46 --> 8907.78]  Yeah.
[8907.78 --> 8907.90]  Yeah.
[8907.90 --> 8908.06]  Yeah.
[8908.06 --> 8908.34]  Yeah.
[8908.34 --> 8908.42]  Yeah.
[8909.06 --> 8909.46]  Okay.
[8911.26 --> 8912.84]  Don't forget about the Coke murders.
[8913.14 --> 8915.16]  Never forget the Coca-Cola murders.
[8916.06 --> 8919.04]  There's some wild stuff in the food industry.
[8919.32 --> 8920.54]  It's actually nuts.
[8920.72 --> 8920.86]  Yeah.
[8920.86 --> 8922.32]  They literally don't even,
[8922.50 --> 8924.58]  their defense was not even that they didn't do it.
[8924.62 --> 8925.46]  It didn't happen here.
[8925.46 --> 8929.50]  Their defense was that it was not within the prosecution's jurisdiction.
[8931.12 --> 8932.14]  You know what they did?
[8933.10 --> 8933.50]  Yes.
[8933.92 --> 8934.36]  Unfortunately,
[8934.66 --> 8935.54]  there's also lays.
[8935.66 --> 8939.00]  I don't forget about the palm oil industry in general,
[8939.00 --> 8941.06]  like literally palm oil,
[8941.24 --> 8943.62]  actually destroying entire nations.
[8945.76 --> 8946.18]  Sick.
[8946.32 --> 8946.76]  But Hey,
[8946.82 --> 8947.76]  at least it's a,
[8947.84 --> 8947.94]  what,
[8947.98 --> 8948.30]  what was,
[8948.38 --> 8949.40]  what was the argument for it?
[8949.40 --> 8950.36]  It was like lower calories,
[8950.58 --> 8951.74]  healthier or something,
[8951.82 --> 8952.50]  natural something.
[8952.58 --> 8953.10]  I forget.
[8953.58 --> 8954.16]  I forget.
[8954.30 --> 8954.78]  But yeah,
[8954.84 --> 8955.04]  yeah,
[8955.16 --> 8955.46]  yeah.
[8955.46 --> 8955.78]  Yeah.
[8955.78 --> 8957.00]  Sorry for bringing up palm oil.
[8957.32 --> 8959.34]  It feels like some like portal stuff.
[8959.48 --> 8959.88]  It's like,
[8959.90 --> 8962.42]  it's lower calories for the ones who are still alive.
[8962.60 --> 8962.74]  Yeah,
[8962.74 --> 8962.98]  exactly.
[8964.02 --> 8964.42]  Like dude,
[8964.50 --> 8964.64]  it's,
[8964.74 --> 8966.46]  this is one of those things where it's like,
[8966.54 --> 8966.72]  I,
[8966.84 --> 8967.96]  I,
[8968.10 --> 8970.54]  I am not about what about ism.
[8970.98 --> 8973.88]  Like what about ism is a super weak argument when someone says,
[8973.98 --> 8974.06]  Hey,
[8974.06 --> 8974.98]  you did a bad thing.
[8974.98 --> 8976.74]  And they point back and they go,
[8977.08 --> 8977.16]  well,
[8977.22 --> 8977.50]  what about,
[8977.60 --> 8977.84]  what about,
[8977.94 --> 8980.66]  what about there are valid cases for it.
[8980.84 --> 8982.98]  If someone is engaging in hypocrisy,
[8982.98 --> 8984.98]  there's nothing I think that I dislike,
[8984.98 --> 8987.00]  dislike more than hypocrisy.
[8987.18 --> 8990.00]  Like if I'm calling out Luke for his,
[8990.00 --> 8990.98]  um,
[8991.90 --> 8992.24]  get me,
[8992.32 --> 8995.38]  I don't know his big nose.
[8995.58 --> 8995.94]  Perfect.
[8996.08 --> 8996.32]  Right.
[8996.66 --> 8997.06]  Actually,
[8997.06 --> 8999.20]  that's a bad example because it's an inherent trait,
[8999.26 --> 9002.12]  but my point was just that my nose is bigger than his.
[9002.50 --> 9003.08]  So if I were,
[9003.14 --> 9003.92]  if I were calling,
[9005.00 --> 9005.22]  Oh,
[9005.30 --> 9005.70]  come on.
[9005.88 --> 9006.24]  I don't,
[9006.32 --> 9007.20]  I don't look at these things.
[9007.26 --> 9008.06]  I genuinely don't.
[9008.20 --> 9008.90]  Literally Royal.
[9009.02 --> 9009.88]  I can't see myself.
[9010.22 --> 9010.70]  Deluxe.
[9010.70 --> 9012.46]  I like to describe it as deluxe.
[9012.46 --> 9015.78]  nose prime.
[9016.02 --> 9016.28]  Yeah.
[9016.70 --> 9017.10]  Nice.
[9017.38 --> 9017.82]  Um,
[9017.98 --> 9018.38]  I like it.
[9018.48 --> 9019.26]  Or whatever it is.
[9019.30 --> 9022.44]  If I am actively engaging in the same behavior or,
[9022.72 --> 9023.72]  or the same behavior,
[9023.72 --> 9024.30]  but worse,
[9024.72 --> 9026.88]  that is absolutely a valid defense.
[9027.02 --> 9028.56]  That is not what about ism.
[9028.68 --> 9029.20]  That is,
[9029.26 --> 9032.48]  you're being a hypocrite and you actually need to sort out your own
[9032.48 --> 9034.62]  before you start talking about anyone else's.
[9034.84 --> 9035.04]  Yeah.
[9035.04 --> 9035.76]  Um,
[9035.84 --> 9036.50]  so that's a,
[9036.62 --> 9038.34]  that's a completely different thing,
[9038.34 --> 9039.22]  but you know,
[9039.26 --> 9039.82]  in general,
[9039.82 --> 9040.42]  I am not,
[9040.48 --> 9041.96]  I'm not about what about ism,
[9042.00 --> 9045.22]  but I also do think that in the gaming and in the tech industry,
[9045.22 --> 9046.88]  we tend to,
[9047.04 --> 9050.84]  we tend to end up with kind of tunnel vision on the things that are
[9050.84 --> 9052.42]  happening within our space.
[9052.42 --> 9053.02]  You know,
[9053.08 --> 9053.38]  I think,
[9053.44 --> 9055.32]  I think a great example of this was the,
[9055.32 --> 9055.50]  uh,
[9055.50 --> 9058.98]  the principled technologies benchmarking scandal from Intel.
[9059.10 --> 9060.18]  Do you even remember this?
[9060.28 --> 9060.62]  I do.
[9060.72 --> 9060.92]  Yeah.
[9061.48 --> 9067.52]  Basically someone at Intel fucked up some charts and they got published,
[9067.52 --> 9070.18]  even though they were obviously not right.
[9070.18 --> 9071.88]  and they caused a,
[9071.88 --> 9074.52]  a very unfavorable comparison to AMD.
[9074.52 --> 9076.34]  That was just obviously not right.
[9076.46 --> 9077.92]  I looked at that whole situation.
[9078.06 --> 9078.26]  I went,
[9078.70 --> 9078.82]  yeah,
[9078.94 --> 9079.86]  someone fucked up.
[9080.02 --> 9080.96]  There was issues everywhere.
[9081.32 --> 9082.30]  And legal problem.
[9082.42 --> 9083.26]  And whoever they are,
[9083.30 --> 9085.76]  are high up enough that they can cover their butts.
[9086.16 --> 9087.52]  And trying to deal with it.
[9087.58 --> 9088.74]  They did a pretty bad job.
[9088.90 --> 9090.46]  And legal probably came in and said,
[9090.54 --> 9090.72]  look,
[9090.80 --> 9091.94]  if we say anything,
[9092.08 --> 9096.14]  we open ourselves up to a bunch of legal liability because we acknowledge the
[9096.14 --> 9096.58]  error,
[9096.72 --> 9100.14]  which would mean that AMD would have grounds that we,
[9100.18 --> 9103.00]  have effectively admitted that we are guilty of doing this.
[9103.06 --> 9104.06]  When in reality,
[9104.06 --> 9108.68]  it was probably just some dumb like on the marketing team that didn't realize
[9108.68 --> 9109.74]  that this was a problem.
[9110.34 --> 9110.72]  Um,
[9110.94 --> 9111.58]  cause I can,
[9111.66 --> 9113.40]  I promise you none of the technical people.
[9113.40 --> 9116.42]  I thought there was more stuff like a test bench hidden under a table and all
[9116.42 --> 9117.00]  these other things.
[9117.14 --> 9117.58]  That no.
[9117.86 --> 9118.46]  I don't remember.
[9118.52 --> 9119.56]  Maybe this was some other thing.
[9119.60 --> 9123.82]  It was a small enough thing that it could have easily been coordinated by like
[9123.82 --> 9125.70]  one or two people who didn't,
[9125.70 --> 9126.04]  who did,
[9126.10 --> 9126.44]  who just,
[9126.60 --> 9127.42]  I remember that part,
[9127.52 --> 9128.72]  who were just dumb.
[9129.10 --> 9129.34]  Sure.
[9129.34 --> 9131.48]  Just plain dumb and wait,
[9131.58 --> 9135.08]  you and probably didn't listen to any of the smarter people who absolutely know
[9135.08 --> 9135.30]  better.
[9135.38 --> 9135.52]  I mean,
[9135.56 --> 9140.76]  that's the thing about organizations as an organization can do something that was
[9140.76 --> 9148.54]  actually just a couple of complete idiots or just like a wicked miscommunication or a
[9148.54 --> 9149.26]  wicked miscommunication.
[9149.26 --> 9150.58]  I don't think that one was a miscommunication.
[9150.58 --> 9151.14]  I don't think so either.
[9151.22 --> 9151.68]  I'm just saying,
[9151.76 --> 9152.92]  I think it was a lot of ways for this.
[9152.92 --> 9155.38]  I think it was someone with too much power and,
[9155.38 --> 9160.22]  and who was arrogant and who didn't understand.
[9160.52 --> 9164.54]  I think it was someone who's being paid more than their understanding of the technical details
[9164.54 --> 9165.86]  of the product is,
[9165.94 --> 9167.10]  is what I will say.
[9167.10 --> 9169.56]  And,
[9169.56 --> 9170.52]  you know,
[9170.62 --> 9170.84]  the,
[9170.84 --> 9178.06]  but the way that people kind of blew up about this and the kind of conspiracy theories that were spawned from it,
[9178.06 --> 9178.44]  I was like,
[9178.52 --> 9178.80]  look,
[9179.22 --> 9179.42]  man,
[9179.44 --> 9180.96]  you guys never heard of Hanlon's razor?
[9180.96 --> 9183.06]  You know Hanlon's razor,
[9183.18 --> 9183.60]  obviously,
[9183.74 --> 9183.92]  right?
[9184.56 --> 9185.70]  I didn't know it was Hanlon.
[9185.94 --> 9186.10]  Yeah.
[9186.20 --> 9186.52]  Never,
[9186.58 --> 9190.54]  never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.
[9190.90 --> 9191.26]  Yeah,
[9191.26 --> 9191.82]  it is Hanlon.
[9192.06 --> 9192.20]  Yeah.
[9192.34 --> 9192.54]  Yeah,
[9192.54 --> 9192.86]  I know.
[9193.06 --> 9193.60]  Hanlon's razor.
[9194.34 --> 9194.74]  Um,
[9194.74 --> 9197.78]  and I never got anyone from Intel to confirm my version of the story,
[9197.78 --> 9200.82]  but what I did get was I got on a call where I said,
[9200.88 --> 9201.06]  look,
[9201.38 --> 9201.86]  tell you what,
[9201.90 --> 9202.42]  how about this?
[9203.18 --> 9204.84]  Tell me that what I'm saying is wrong.
[9207.10 --> 9210.08]  And I finished telling my story of how I kind of assumed it happened.
[9210.08 --> 9211.28]  And then just no one really responded.
[9211.50 --> 9211.82]  And then,
[9211.90 --> 9212.08]  well,
[9212.10 --> 9214.60]  this was one person that was talking to me off the record.
[9214.60 --> 9215.52]  Cause they were just like,
[9215.52 --> 9218.20]  you know,
[9218.22 --> 9218.58]  look,
[9218.58 --> 9219.26]  I just,
[9219.36 --> 9222.84]  I don't want people thinking that our whole department is like evil people.
[9223.14 --> 9224.70]  And they were basically just like,
[9224.84 --> 9225.96]  well,
[9225.98 --> 9229.06]  this has been a nice call and I'll talk to you another time.
[9229.74 --> 9230.42]  Cause it's,
[9230.60 --> 9230.80]  well,
[9230.84 --> 9231.78]  it's just obvious.
[9231.78 --> 9235.30]  If you understand the human elements that go into something like that,
[9235.36 --> 9238.50]  it's easier to pick it apart because the,
[9238.62 --> 9239.50]  the idea,
[9240.08 --> 9244.52]  that anyone is organized enough to have coordinated that as like a,
[9244.52 --> 9245.70]  as like a campaign.
[9246.16 --> 9246.76]  I mean,
[9246.76 --> 9246.94]  it's,
[9246.94 --> 9247.18]  it's,
[9247.18 --> 9247.72]  it's silly,
[9247.80 --> 9248.00]  right?
[9248.06 --> 9248.64]  Like it's,
[9248.76 --> 9250.54]  I think just while we're on it,
[9250.60 --> 9253.46]  I think Hanlon's razor has a dangerous side of it,
[9253.64 --> 9254.60]  which is where you,
[9255.08 --> 9259.68]  if you start overly making people innocent,
[9259.68 --> 9261.32]  you make yourself very vulnerable.
[9262.08 --> 9264.68]  Cause there is a lot of malice.
[9264.96 --> 9265.96]  And that is true.
[9265.96 --> 9266.66]  And you know what?
[9266.90 --> 9279.88]  I have multiple times in my life ended up in a bad situation because I have a tendency to attribute to misunderstanding as my default.
[9279.88 --> 9281.34]  But you know what?
[9281.74 --> 9282.16]  I just,
[9282.28 --> 9284.54]  I just don't think I can live my life the other way.
[9284.54 --> 9284.82]  No,
[9284.88 --> 9285.08]  I think,
[9285.16 --> 9285.40]  I think,
[9285.56 --> 9286.86]  and I'm usually right.
[9287.16 --> 9287.60]  I agree.
[9287.84 --> 9288.28]  And that's,
[9288.36 --> 9288.80]  it's,
[9289.22 --> 9289.52]  you know,
[9289.68 --> 9290.72]  defaulting to malice.
[9290.80 --> 9291.30]  You're just going to,
[9291.42 --> 9293.24]  you're not going to have any friends and your life's going to suck.
[9293.24 --> 9297.04]  But you just do also have to be aware that there are malicious people out there.
[9297.38 --> 9297.74]  Absolutely.
[9298.16 --> 9299.60]  And you can't just like be blind to it forever.
[9299.74 --> 9303.00]  I want to show this real quick before we get off the topic by tangenting too hard somehow.
[9303.54 --> 9304.26]  That if,
[9304.38 --> 9306.14]  if you've heard all this and you know,
[9306.22 --> 9308.66]  you still might be into the whole teaming thing.
[9308.76 --> 9309.34]  You can,
[9309.46 --> 9311.78]  you can jump on amdfanstore.com.
[9311.86 --> 9311.92]  Oh,
[9311.92 --> 9312.04]  there's crin.
[9312.10 --> 9315.86]  And get yourself some $8 to AMD team red.
[9315.86 --> 9317.76]  Just say AMD clown team.
[9318.32 --> 9318.76]  I don't know,
[9318.82 --> 9319.02]  like.
[9319.08 --> 9320.06]  Red nose team.
[9320.26 --> 9320.62]  Nice.
[9320.62 --> 9321.06]  In,
[9321.12 --> 9322.90]  in the defense of the cycling Jersey,
[9322.90 --> 9323.94]  I'm pretty sure,
[9323.94 --> 9324.46]  uh,
[9324.50 --> 9326.80]  Intel has some jerseys as well.
[9326.82 --> 9328.36]  Don't they from something?
[9328.62 --> 9328.76]  Oh,
[9328.86 --> 9329.36]  probably.
[9329.64 --> 9329.98]  Yeah.
[9331.36 --> 9331.80]  Nice.
[9332.34 --> 9333.40]  They don't have that many products.
[9334.40 --> 9335.62]  $50 waist pack.
[9337.20 --> 9338.24]  $60 waist pack.
[9338.30 --> 9338.46]  Sorry.
[9339.92 --> 9340.58]  I mean,
[9340.68 --> 9342.14]  they have quite a few products actually.
[9342.22 --> 9342.52]  At least.
[9343.16 --> 9343.26]  Oh,
[9343.26 --> 9343.54]  wow.
[9343.54 --> 9347.22]  I was about to say at least their worthless swag is priced like worthless swag.
[9347.32 --> 9347.76]  Like their,
[9347.82 --> 9348.08]  uh,
[9348.08 --> 9349.72]  their sunglasses were like 10 bucks,
[9349.72 --> 9350.84]  but like,
[9351.06 --> 9351.70]  man,
[9351.78 --> 9352.04]  that,
[9352.18 --> 9352.58]  uh,
[9353.58 --> 9353.84]  I mean,
[9353.84 --> 9355.64]  that's a tool backpack though.
[9355.66 --> 9356.84]  That's not just AMD.
[9358.88 --> 9360.28]  That almost feels like they,
[9360.36 --> 9363.22]  they produced a bunch of them for staff and they're just like making them available.
[9363.46 --> 9363.88]  Computer backpack.
[9364.02 --> 9364.72]  I thought it was commuter.
[9367.86 --> 9369.66]  I don't know if you're going to find the exact same one.
[9369.72 --> 9370.54]  Is it that second one?
[9371.66 --> 9372.18]  Oh no.
[9372.22 --> 9373.58]  The zipper goes across like that.
[9373.66 --> 9373.80]  Oh,
[9373.84 --> 9375.08]  is it that 12 custom?
[9375.98 --> 9376.30]  Uh,
[9376.30 --> 9376.50]  okay.
[9376.50 --> 9376.70]  Well,
[9376.76 --> 9378.30]  12 of them for 1406.
[9379.08 --> 9379.72]  Why is,
[9379.80 --> 9380.36]  why is that?
[9380.76 --> 9382.52]  Staples promotional products.
[9382.74 --> 9383.04]  Nice.
[9385.26 --> 9386.08]  Loptop backpacks.
[9386.16 --> 9386.32]  All right.
[9386.38 --> 9387.98]  Luke doing the real research here.
[9388.12 --> 9388.96]  I want to find it.
[9390.02 --> 9391.28]  Is it an older model?
[9392.04 --> 9394.36]  Got an investigative journalist here.
[9396.26 --> 9396.60]  Luke,
[9396.82 --> 9397.16]  Luke,
[9397.40 --> 9397.72]  Luke,
[9397.86 --> 9398.06]  Luke.
[9398.06 --> 9398.28]  Come on.
[9398.34 --> 9398.80]  Let's cheer him on.
[9399.02 --> 9399.14]  Luke,
[9399.24 --> 9399.70]  Luke,
[9399.70 --> 9399.90]  Luke,
[9399.90 --> 9400.16]  Luke,
[9400.16 --> 9400.28]  Luke,
[9400.28 --> 9400.48]  Luke,
[9400.48 --> 9400.74]  Luke,
[9400.74 --> 9400.84]  Luke,
[9400.84 --> 9401.12]  Luke,
[9401.12 --> 9401.22]  Luke,
[9401.22 --> 9401.72]  Luke,
[9401.72 --> 9401.98]  Luke,
[9401.98 --> 9402.22]  Luke,
[9402.22 --> 9402.28]  Luke,
[9402.28 --> 9402.72]  Luke,
[9402.72 --> 9403.22]  Luke,
[9403.22 --> 9403.28]  Luke,
[9403.28 --> 9403.84]  Luke,
[9403.84 --> 9404.34]  Luke,
[9404.34 --> 9404.36]  Luke,
[9404.36 --> 9404.68]  Luke,
[9404.68 --> 9404.88]  Luke,
[9404.88 --> 9405.38]  Luke,
[9405.38 --> 9405.50]  Luke.
[9405.50 --> 9405.74]  That's fine.
[9406.22 --> 9406.96]  I'm over it.
[9407.32 --> 9407.68]  Oh,
[9407.74 --> 9407.92]  well,
[9408.04 --> 9409.72]  I took away your screen sharing privileges.
[9409.92 --> 9410.30]  That's fine.
[9410.38 --> 9410.58]  Yeah,
[9410.66 --> 9410.92]  I didn't,
[9410.92 --> 9411.24]  I didn't,
[9411.30 --> 9411.94]  I didn't find it.
[9411.96 --> 9412.36]  I failed.
[9413.80 --> 9414.52]  I'm still looking.
[9414.56 --> 9416.02]  I don't even remember what our topic was,
[9416.08 --> 9418.48]  but basically don't be fans of like,
[9418.64 --> 9420.46]  especially public companies.
[9420.56 --> 9420.68]  Yeah.
[9420.68 --> 9421.16]  If you're going to,
[9421.16 --> 9422.90]  if you're going to act like it personally,
[9422.90 --> 9423.42]  just,
[9423.48 --> 9424.38]  uh,
[9424.38 --> 9425.58]  don't act like it publicly.
[9426.18 --> 9426.62]  I mean,
[9426.62 --> 9427.44]  I guess that's an option.
[9427.44 --> 9428.20]  Like there's been,
[9428.20 --> 9428.94]  uh,
[9430.14 --> 9430.48]  Ooh.
[9430.94 --> 9431.90]  Speaking of companies,
[9431.90 --> 9434.84]  you should not be a fan of what now.
[9434.84 --> 9435.28]  Oh,
[9435.32 --> 9435.58]  Oh,
[9435.58 --> 9435.82]  Oh,
[9435.98 --> 9437.50]  55 bucks.
[9437.60 --> 9437.74]  Hey,
[9439.16 --> 9439.34]  Hmm.
[9439.66 --> 9439.96]  All right.
[9439.96 --> 9440.10]  Well,
[9440.12 --> 9440.88]  that's a good markup.
[9442.40 --> 9443.24]  Pretty solid,
[9443.72 --> 9444.62]  solid markup.
[9444.70 --> 9444.80]  Oh,
[9444.86 --> 9445.24]  $40,
[9445.64 --> 9448.44]  $40 for a decorated sample though.
[9448.50 --> 9449.56]  That's to order a sample.
[9450.18 --> 9452.00]  They may do discounted samples.
[9452.00 --> 9452.96]  So I don't,
[9452.96 --> 9453.72]  I don't,
[9453.72 --> 9454.92]  don't read too much into this.
[9455.14 --> 9455.38]  That's true.
[9455.56 --> 9456.80]  What does decorated sample mean?
[9457.26 --> 9457.64]  Well,
[9457.64 --> 9458.02]  this is,
[9458.08 --> 9458.94]  these guys are,
[9459.10 --> 9460.22]  these guys are a printing company.
[9460.22 --> 9460.76]  So you,
[9460.98 --> 9462.96]  you would order a custom one and look,
[9463.02 --> 9464.24]  the minimum order quantity is 12.
[9464.48 --> 9465.48]  So they're expect,
[9465.58 --> 9466.62]  they're expecting a volume order.
[9467.34 --> 9472.74]  So that may just be the price for a sample with the expectation that you will order a bunch and the prices,
[9472.92 --> 9473.72]  the pricing might be higher.
[9473.88 --> 9476.36]  So if you want backpacks to your like team or something like that.
[9476.60 --> 9477.00]  Exactly.
[9477.20 --> 9477.62]  That's cool.
[9478.34 --> 9479.18]  Speaking of companies,
[9479.18 --> 9481.70]  you shouldn't be a fan of a YouTube has done a lot.
[9481.86 --> 9482.88]  Google has had over,
[9482.96 --> 9483.20]  well,
[9483.38 --> 9486.88]  overall an overwhelmingly positive impact on my life.
[9486.88 --> 9487.14]  Nice.
[9487.34 --> 9487.58]  Nice.
[9487.68 --> 9488.04]  Sorry.
[9488.62 --> 9488.80]  Sorry.
[9488.80 --> 9489.78]  You are just determined.
[9489.88 --> 9490.20]  You know what?
[9490.28 --> 9490.44]  Fine.
[9490.52 --> 9491.00]  You do the show.
[9491.28 --> 9491.38]  No,
[9491.46 --> 9492.00]  you do the show.
[9492.32 --> 9492.60]  Nice.
[9492.98 --> 9493.20]  Oh,
[9493.60 --> 9494.10]  okay.
[9494.14 --> 9494.66]  I get it.
[9494.76 --> 9495.12]  Nice.
[9495.38 --> 9496.20]  Thank you for that.
[9496.66 --> 9497.02]  Sorry.
[9497.10 --> 9497.52]  Keep going.
[9498.64 --> 9500.60]  YouTube loves pause ads.
[9500.74 --> 9500.92]  There.
[9501.02 --> 9502.20]  I'm not even going to try and segue.
[9502.32 --> 9502.74]  I give up.
[9502.82 --> 9503.74]  I don't even care anymore.
[9505.60 --> 9506.82]  For the past year,
[9507.12 --> 9511.32]  YouTube has been piloting ads that appear on smart TVs when playback is paused.
[9512.10 --> 9516.56]  Google presented the pilot as a success in their first quarter earnings call as a
[9516.56 --> 9521.58]  non-interruptive ad format that nonetheless had significant advertiser demand.
[9522.16 --> 9524.36]  Pause ads have likewise been rolled out by Roku.
[9524.92 --> 9529.64]  Here's an example of a YouTube pause ad courtesy of TechSpot.
[9529.80 --> 9533.58]  So the image of the show gets smaller and an ad pops up on the side.
[9533.70 --> 9533.90]  Ooh,
[9534.10 --> 9535.46]  snack break right around the corner.
[9535.62 --> 9536.74]  Probably fine to be honest.
[9537.44 --> 9537.82]  Really?
[9537.98 --> 9538.54]  As a user,
[9539.04 --> 9540.52]  if you're going to have an ad somewhere,
[9540.52 --> 9541.96]  this seems the least intrusive.
[9542.04 --> 9543.40]  I don't like my UI moving around.
[9544.38 --> 9545.50]  I really don't like that.
[9545.50 --> 9550.00]  When I go to pause something and then replay it,
[9550.08 --> 9552.82]  I really don't like my button to move.
[9553.74 --> 9555.42]  I think it wouldn't though.
[9555.70 --> 9556.06]  Realistically,
[9556.16 --> 9557.42]  I'm not going to see it anyway though.
[9557.48 --> 9558.98]  So I guess this is all so hypothetical.
[9558.98 --> 9559.00]  Yeah.
[9559.00 --> 9560.38]  And if you're pressing,
[9560.52 --> 9562.36]  would you generally press in the middle of the screen?
[9563.44 --> 9563.80]  Yeah.
[9563.92 --> 9566.26]  Because the middle of the screen here is still the player.
[9566.76 --> 9569.28]  And you don't have to click on the play icon for it to play.
[9569.36 --> 9570.38]  You just have to click on the player.
[9570.50 --> 9571.40]  This is true.
[9571.78 --> 9572.82]  So it would still work.
[9573.50 --> 9574.10]  I'm still mad.
[9574.76 --> 9574.94]  There.
[9577.82 --> 9578.26]  I mean,
[9578.32 --> 9578.52]  I don't,
[9578.60 --> 9578.70]  I mean,
[9578.70 --> 9580.62]  it's not like I like it to be clear.
[9580.72 --> 9581.24]  I just think of,
[9581.34 --> 9582.22]  you heard it here first.
[9582.36 --> 9583.78]  Luke likes pause ads.
[9583.80 --> 9584.36]  Oh my goodness.
[9584.60 --> 9585.94]  Of all the things that they could do.
[9585.94 --> 9587.48]  That's going to be a site very soon.
[9588.04 --> 9589.62]  Luke likes pause ads.com.
[9589.62 --> 9590.48]  Should put them on float plane.
[9591.34 --> 9591.74]  No.
[9592.82 --> 9593.18]  No.
[9594.04 --> 9594.30]  See,
[9594.36 --> 9595.22]  he's already working on it.
[9595.28 --> 9596.24]  That's why he says no,
[9596.34 --> 9599.48]  because now we're onto his devious plan to put pause ads on float plane.
[9599.56 --> 9600.18]  They're going to riot,
[9600.58 --> 9600.76]  Luke.
[9601.00 --> 9601.86]  They're going to riot.
[9601.86 --> 9603.74]  These are our most loyal customers.
[9603.86 --> 9605.06]  Why would you do that to them?
[9605.18 --> 9608.00]  What we are working on is getting official captions.
[9608.22 --> 9608.74]  So that'll be nice.
[9609.26 --> 9609.42]  Oh,
[9609.44 --> 9609.80]  that's cool.
[9610.04 --> 9610.18]  Yeah.
[9610.26 --> 9610.44]  Like,
[9610.48 --> 9611.08]  are they like,
[9611.40 --> 9612.74]  like machine learning generated?
[9612.98 --> 9613.62]  Whisper generated.
[9613.86 --> 9615.80]  And then there will be an option for manual upload as well.
[9615.90 --> 9616.04]  Oh,
[9616.06 --> 9616.66]  that's pretty cool.
[9616.86 --> 9617.10]  Yeah.
[9617.46 --> 9619.14]  That's going to save the social team a lot of work.
[9619.28 --> 9619.58]  Yeah.
[9619.86 --> 9621.24]  Are they the main driver of this?
[9621.88 --> 9622.24]  Uh,
[9622.50 --> 9624.02]  they've definitely asked for it,
[9624.02 --> 9625.42]  but I think we just,
[9625.52 --> 9629.00]  we hit a bit of a milestone in regards to like site stuff.
[9629.00 --> 9629.42]  So the,
[9629.42 --> 9635.74]  the whole like angular to react upgrade thing finished and our new transcoding system is reinstated.
[9636.96 --> 9638.70]  Is that a correct way of saying that?
[9638.76 --> 9638.98]  I don't know.
[9639.02 --> 9639.20]  Whatever.
[9639.60 --> 9640.04]  Um,
[9640.12 --> 9642.42]  both of those happen at a relatively similar period of time.
[9642.72 --> 9644.66]  So like future development is bubbling again,
[9645.08 --> 9645.52]  which is good.
[9645.78 --> 9646.18]  Sick.
[9646.42 --> 9646.76]  All right.
[9646.86 --> 9647.06]  Yeah.
[9648.40 --> 9649.94]  I think it's time for WAN show after dark.
[9650.50 --> 9650.82]  Nice.
[9651.08 --> 9652.22]  Have we done all the major topics?
[9653.00 --> 9653.28]  Uh,
[9653.34 --> 9654.02]  major topics.
[9654.12 --> 9654.28]  Yes,
[9654.34 --> 9655.18]  there are other ones.
[9655.34 --> 9655.44]  Oh,
[9655.46 --> 9655.70]  there are.
[9655.70 --> 9655.78]  Wait,
[9656.02 --> 9657.22]  Google play celebrates Sonic.
[9657.64 --> 9657.98]  Oh wait,
[9658.00 --> 9659.26]  we didn't talk about the rabbit R1.
[9659.90 --> 9660.10]  Ah,
[9660.10 --> 9660.82]  let's do it in the dark.
[9661.20 --> 9661.50]  Nice.
[9662.28 --> 9662.56]  Nice.
[9663.00 --> 9664.60]  Do you want me to do the Sonic thing while you're doing that?
[9666.22 --> 9667.90]  Google play celebrates Sonic,
[9668.04 --> 9670.14]  but gets every single fact wrong.
[9670.30 --> 9670.88]  Last Saturday,
[9671.04 --> 9674.28]  the official Google play Twitter account posted a strange thread,
[9674.28 --> 9679.56]  supposedly showing off the changes in Sonic the Hedgehog's design over the last 30 years.
[9679.82 --> 9680.12]  However,
[9680.30 --> 9687.04]  literally every post in the entire thread is incorrectly labeled and inaccurate.
[9688.70 --> 9688.96]  Hmm.
[9689.26 --> 9691.56]  Each has been corrected with a community note.
[9691.96 --> 9692.22]  Uh,
[9692.22 --> 9698.50]  some have suggested that the thread was generated using AI and posted without human oversight.
[9699.06 --> 9699.66]  However,
[9699.80 --> 9704.06]  Google has yet to either remove or address the thread despite widespread
[9704.06 --> 9704.82]  news coverage.
[9705.12 --> 9706.64]  This is so weird.
[9708.64 --> 9711.70]  And like the image that they even put of Sonic.
[9715.40 --> 9716.80]  Looks AI generated.
[9721.88 --> 9722.68]  I don't know.
[9722.74 --> 9724.44]  Where's the shadow over his arm coming from?
[9724.44 --> 9726.54]  This is Sonic as he appears in Sonic Boom.
[9726.66 --> 9727.12]  Nevermind.
[9728.74 --> 9731.40]  It's possible that Google play have confused it for the game Sonic CD,
[9731.54 --> 9732.48]  which did with his 993.
[9732.48 --> 9735.02]  The reason why I said that is because his hand here,
[9735.10 --> 9737.48]  which is like placed on his hip is not actually touching his hip.
[9738.08 --> 9738.52]  So I was like,
[9738.58 --> 9739.98]  maybe it's some AI stuff,
[9740.10 --> 9742.62]  but this could be a shot from inside the,
[9742.90 --> 9743.66]  I don't think so.
[9743.70 --> 9744.82]  I actually don't think so either.
[9745.24 --> 9745.92]  It's weird.
[9746.20 --> 9747.46]  I think it's just shockingly poorly.
[9747.46 --> 9747.76]  Again,
[9747.88 --> 9748.60]  Hanlon's razor.
[9749.24 --> 9751.62]  I think it's just shockingly poorly researched.
[9752.70 --> 9753.00]  You don't,
[9753.02 --> 9754.00]  you don't think it's AI stuff?
[9755.46 --> 9755.86]  No,
[9755.96 --> 9756.90]  I don't think so.
[9756.90 --> 9758.68]  I think this is too wrong to be AI.
[9760.06 --> 9762.36]  I don't think an AI would get everything wrong.
[9762.62 --> 9762.64]  Like,
[9762.68 --> 9763.40]  like what AI?
[9764.18 --> 9765.38]  What AI did they use for that?
[9765.60 --> 9765.64]  Yeah,
[9765.64 --> 9766.06]  fair enough.
[9766.08 --> 9767.24]  I don't think I believe that.
[9767.76 --> 9767.98]  Yeah.
[9768.78 --> 9769.28]  All right.
[9769.48 --> 9772.44]  US government adds foxes to AI henhouse thing.
[9772.90 --> 9773.94]  Whatever this means.
[9773.94 --> 9779.68]  US Homeland Security has created a new artificial intelligence safety and security board,
[9779.80 --> 9785.36]  which is intended to meet once every financial quarter to discuss partial,
[9785.90 --> 9791.78]  practical recommendations for the US government on how to best manage the threats posed by AI development.
[9791.94 --> 9792.06]  Yeah,
[9792.08 --> 9792.50]  let's meet,
[9792.58 --> 9794.02]  let's meet once a quarter.
[9794.34 --> 9794.56]  Nice.
[9794.76 --> 9794.90]  No,
[9794.92 --> 9795.00]  no,
[9795.00 --> 9795.70]  this is great though.
[9795.70 --> 9797.62]  The board has 23 members,
[9798.16 --> 9800.54]  including Sam Altman of OpenAI,
[9801.18 --> 9802.58]  Satya Nadella of Microsoft,
[9802.58 --> 9804.04]  Sundar Pichai of Alphabet,
[9804.68 --> 9806.12]  and Dario Amode,
[9806.58 --> 9806.96]  Amode,
[9807.42 --> 9807.70]  sorry,
[9807.92 --> 9808.90]  of Anthropic,
[9809.18 --> 9810.76]  as well as Jensen Huang of NVIDIA.
[9811.32 --> 9812.86]  There are also representatives from Adobe,
[9813.02 --> 9813.26]  Amazon,
[9813.42 --> 9813.64]  AMD,
[9813.78 --> 9814.00]  Cisco,
[9814.16 --> 9814.40]  IBM,
[9814.54 --> 9815.12]  Delta Airlines,
[9815.26 --> 9816.34]  and Northrop Grumman.
[9817.22 --> 9823.26]  This has led to criticism of the potential of regulatory capture and excessive industry influence.
[9823.88 --> 9824.28]  Seriously,
[9824.50 --> 9829.80]  your AI safety and security board is basically just made out of companies that profit from AI.
[9829.80 --> 9832.24]  So the US Homeland Security,
[9832.24 --> 9835.14]  has created a new artificial intelligence,
[9835.26 --> 9836.28]  safety and security board,
[9836.54 --> 9843.94]  also known as a pre-planned lobbying meeting that happens once a quarter so they can make ridiculous amounts of money.
[9845.02 --> 9845.32]  Also,
[9845.42 --> 9856.80]  I love that they have Sam Altman and Satya Nadella in the same meeting as if they're representing like two very distinctly different companies when it's like,
[9856.86 --> 9857.12]  yeah,
[9857.12 --> 9857.72]  sure.
[9858.72 --> 9860.36]  Now there are other members,
[9860.84 --> 9862.14]  mostly civil rights experts,
[9862.32 --> 9862.64]  academics,
[9862.76 --> 9863.32]  and politicians,
[9863.90 --> 9866.34]  though there's the odd inclusion of Vicky Holub,
[9866.56 --> 9869.14]  president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum,
[9869.36 --> 9872.64]  an energy company that is interested in incorporating AI.
[9872.64 --> 9873.54]  Just interested.
[9873.84 --> 9875.50]  Our discussion question is,
[9875.54 --> 9879.90]  what is a good amount of industry involvement to have in these kinds of oversight slash recommendation bodies?
[9879.96 --> 9880.08]  I mean,
[9880.12 --> 9888.12]  obviously you have to have some because otherwise you watch the average politician try to talk about cutting edge technology and you just about die,
[9888.22 --> 9888.40]  right?
[9888.40 --> 9890.54]  What would you think about a rotating seat?
[9892.20 --> 9892.42]  Yeah,
[9892.46 --> 9894.08]  I could see that being kind of interesting.
[9894.28 --> 9898.88]  Because I could see being frustrated like if you're not one of the companies that gets selected,
[9899.46 --> 9902.20]  but you're like trying to fight against some of these companies.
[9902.38 --> 9902.50]  Yeah,
[9902.50 --> 9909.26]  hearing different corporate voices from time to time means with how little these guys are aligned with each other on,
[9909.26 --> 9917.18]  there's certainly the opportunity to learn about their businesses without being unduly influenced by their businesses.
[9917.34 --> 9917.76]  But this,
[9917.90 --> 9919.88]  this seems hilarious.
[9920.78 --> 9923.18]  Like just laughably one-sided.
[9924.86 --> 9926.18]  And good luck with that.
[9926.46 --> 9926.76]  All right,
[9926.84 --> 9927.76]  time for some merch messages.
[9928.38 --> 9928.56]  Yeah.
[9929.22 --> 9929.38]  Jared,
[9929.44 --> 9930.94]  we got a few here for you.
[9932.00 --> 9932.44]  Oh,
[9932.48 --> 9934.28]  this should be a good one to start on after dark.
[9934.72 --> 9934.88]  Hello,
[9934.98 --> 9935.70]  WAN.TLL.
[9935.98 --> 9936.44]  Last night,
[9936.50 --> 9938.66]  my fiance almost puked her stomach out.
[9938.66 --> 9941.96]  What was the situation where you were most worried about someone?
[9942.34 --> 9943.90]  I'm waiting for my backpack to be shipped.
[9944.54 --> 9945.50]  Which variant I'll get?
[9945.88 --> 9946.36]  Childbirth.
[9947.02 --> 9947.44]  Yeah,
[9947.50 --> 9948.04]  that makes sense.
[9948.72 --> 9949.36]  I was,
[9949.40 --> 9950.36]  I was deeply worried.
[9950.46 --> 9952.98]  Yvonne's first labor was over 24 hours.
[9955.42 --> 9956.80]  And it was,
[9956.86 --> 9957.36]  it was,
[9957.48 --> 9959.58]  it was a grueling ordeal.
[9959.70 --> 9960.58]  Neither of us slept.
[9962.80 --> 9968.64]  And our first child was in the 99th percentile for headcount.
[9968.66 --> 9969.36]  Head circumference.
[9970.54 --> 9971.88]  Have you ever seen Yvonne?
[9974.94 --> 9975.58]  I mean,
[9975.70 --> 9976.16]  I was on,
[9976.16 --> 9980.14]  I was on the yard podcast and I described her as good breeding stock.
[9980.54 --> 9980.90]  Um,
[9981.08 --> 9987.68]  but that doesn't necessarily mean that she has 99th percentile head circumference.
[9987.84 --> 9988.18]  Hips.
[9988.34 --> 9988.56]  Yeah.
[9988.56 --> 9989.00]  Yeah.
[9989.00 --> 9989.16]  Yeah.
[9989.32 --> 9989.64]  Um,
[9989.64 --> 9989.84]  so,
[9989.96 --> 9992.26]  so that was why that was,
[9992.34 --> 9992.52]  uh,
[9992.52 --> 9994.40]  that was why she ended up with the old,
[9994.40 --> 9995.84]  uh,
[9995.84 --> 9996.68]  on the first one.
[9997.38 --> 9997.82]  Thankfully,
[9997.82 --> 9998.82]  she was able to,
[9998.82 --> 9999.70]  to safely.
[10000.08 --> 10001.28]  When do you make this?
[10001.36 --> 10002.06]  Maybe too personal.
[10002.06 --> 10002.38]  I don't know.
[10002.42 --> 10003.40]  When do you make that call?
[10003.52 --> 10004.02]  Like,
[10004.02 --> 10005.26]  cause you said 24 hours.
[10005.34 --> 10005.58]  Uh,
[10005.58 --> 10006.64]  the baby's heartbeat,
[10006.64 --> 10007.52]  uh,
[10007.52 --> 10008.62]  started to,
[10008.62 --> 10009.44]  uh,
[10009.44 --> 10010.76]  drop or the blood pressure,
[10010.92 --> 10012.00]  or maybe it goes up.
[10012.00 --> 10013.16]  I forget what it is,
[10013.20 --> 10018.52]  but basically some measurable metric baby was in distress and they hucked her on a gurney.
[10019.42 --> 10019.82]  Um,
[10020.06 --> 10022.84]  and this is actually how she lost most of her jewelry,
[10022.84 --> 10023.78]  uh,
[10023.78 --> 10027.80]  because we put it all in a bag cause you're not supposed to wear jewelry during an operation.
[10028.12 --> 10031.66]  They couldn't get her engagement ring off her finger cause it was so swollen.
[10032.16 --> 10032.48]  Uh,
[10032.48 --> 10033.96]  so fortunately we didn't lose that,
[10034.10 --> 10038.50]  but everything else I put into a bag and I left in the room and it was gone by the time we came back from the OR,
[10038.64 --> 10039.52]  which was really unfortunate.
[10039.66 --> 10041.66]  She had some really nice earrings and a necklace and stuff.
[10041.66 --> 10042.58]  That's frustrating.
[10042.68 --> 10042.80]  Yeah.
[10042.82 --> 10043.04]  I mean,
[10043.04 --> 10043.52]  it's fine.
[10043.64 --> 10044.08]  You know what?
[10044.10 --> 10046.70]  If she needs a new necklace on shout out,
[10046.78 --> 10047.96]  I'll get you a necklace this weekend.
[10047.96 --> 10048.62]  Just let me know.
[10048.68 --> 10050.18]  Like things went okay for us in life.
[10050.18 --> 10051.04]  So it's fine.
[10051.60 --> 10051.78]  But,
[10051.88 --> 10052.02]  um,
[10052.02 --> 10052.78]  you know,
[10052.80 --> 10060.32]  there was a really nice pair of Tanzanite earrings that she had that were quite sentimental cause they were like the first earrings I'd ever bought her and stuff like that.
[10060.34 --> 10061.04]  So that really sucks.
[10061.04 --> 10061.32]  But,
[10061.32 --> 10062.20]  you know,
[10062.22 --> 10062.88]  other than that,
[10062.88 --> 10064.18]  it was mostly just,
[10064.28 --> 10064.62]  just the,
[10064.62 --> 10065.58]  the panic of like,
[10065.62 --> 10065.78]  okay,
[10065.78 --> 10066.26]  it's go time.
[10066.40 --> 10067.42]  Go now.
[10067.94 --> 10068.22]  Uh,
[10068.22 --> 10069.18]  we need to go do this.
[10069.44 --> 10070.96]  So do you like pre-approve that?
[10070.96 --> 10072.18]  Like if something goes wrong,
[10072.20 --> 10073.26]  we will do this thing.
[10073.62 --> 10074.82]  That wasn't an option.
[10075.06 --> 10075.50]  Okay.
[10075.60 --> 10079.30]  Because just letting her die and also letting the baby,
[10079.44 --> 10080.34]  letting the baby die.
[10080.42 --> 10081.58]  It could have impacted either of them.
[10081.62 --> 10082.02]  Got it.
[10082.24 --> 10082.86]  Having a,
[10082.98 --> 10083.56]  having a,
[10083.68 --> 10084.52]  you know,
[10084.52 --> 10086.12]  at risk of this being very graphic,
[10086.12 --> 10091.28]  having a deceased infant child inside you is like not good for mom either.
[10091.28 --> 10091.74]  Super bad.
[10091.82 --> 10091.94]  Yeah.
[10092.06 --> 10092.30]  Yeah.
[10092.30 --> 10093.36]  So like the whole thing,
[10093.58 --> 10094.54]  the whole thing was,
[10094.68 --> 10094.94]  was,
[10095.04 --> 10096.46]  was very stressful.
[10096.46 --> 10101.10]  And then our son was actually in the intensive care unit for almost the first week.
[10101.64 --> 10102.06]  Um,
[10102.06 --> 10103.88]  cause he wasn't eating like the,
[10103.96 --> 10104.16]  the,
[10104.16 --> 10107.56]  the birthing process had been extremely exhausting for him as well.
[10108.06 --> 10108.52]  Um,
[10108.60 --> 10108.80]  yeah,
[10108.86 --> 10109.12]  that,
[10109.16 --> 10109.70]  that first,
[10109.90 --> 10110.90]  that,
[10111.02 --> 10113.60]  that birthing process in that first week was like,
[10113.60 --> 10116.60]  was this a good call?
[10118.04 --> 10119.74]  It was pretty stressful.
[10119.74 --> 10120.18]  Oh,
[10120.18 --> 10120.98]  yeah.
[10123.14 --> 10123.62]  Sheesh.
[10123.62 --> 10123.86]  Yeah.
[10123.86 --> 10124.30]  It was tough.
[10125.36 --> 10125.76]  Um,
[10126.12 --> 10128.04]  I forget what the rest of the question was,
[10128.12 --> 10129.82]  but I was worried about someone you've been,
[10129.92 --> 10130.80]  he's ordered a backpack.
[10130.80 --> 10132.32]  What variant is it going to get?
[10132.40 --> 10132.58]  Uh,
[10132.58 --> 10133.56]  if we're out of stock,
[10133.56 --> 10135.56]  then you'll get the new ones coming in stock,
[10135.62 --> 10139.02]  which are the final underscore final V2 variant.
[10139.30 --> 10139.66]  Um,
[10139.66 --> 10143.98]  otherwise you're getting what you're getting and then it'll have a virtual warranty for the second layer.
[10143.98 --> 10148.32]  And we will definitely get you the upgraded carabiners once they are in stock.
[10148.32 --> 10150.46]  And once they've shipped out to everyone who has already ordered.
[10151.34 --> 10152.98]  So speaking of dead kids,
[10152.98 --> 10156.06]  what advice do you have in keeping kids safe online?
[10157.32 --> 10157.92]  I mean,
[10157.94 --> 10158.20]  you just,
[10158.28 --> 10159.02]  you got to talk to them.
[10159.12 --> 10159.46]  That's the,
[10159.52 --> 10160.30]  that's the only choice.
[10160.36 --> 10161.34]  That's what everyone says.
[10161.34 --> 10162.30]  And that's the truth.
[10162.44 --> 10163.78]  If you're looking for another answer,
[10163.78 --> 10165.34]  I'm afraid you're not going to find it here.
[10165.54 --> 10165.84]  Bucko.
[10167.44 --> 10167.70]  Hey,
[10167.80 --> 10169.54]  DLL picked up a windbreaker,
[10169.64 --> 10172.16]  which I love and have a couple of questions about it.
[10172.36 --> 10175.50]  What are the small pockets inside the main pockets for?
[10175.80 --> 10177.28]  And why are they different sizes?
[10177.28 --> 10178.16]  Love the show.
[10179.36 --> 10180.30]  For all the sex you'll be having.
[10180.30 --> 10182.98]  What?
[10183.08 --> 10184.32]  They're wearing LTT store merch.
[10186.72 --> 10187.58]  I don't know.
[10187.68 --> 10191.84]  I jokingly refer to like some of our little pockets as condom pockets.
[10191.84 --> 10193.58]  Cause realistically they're not really useful.
[10193.76 --> 10196.00]  We just really like putting pockets on things.
[10196.06 --> 10196.78]  We think they're cool.
[10197.02 --> 10198.28]  Use it for an air tag.
[10198.34 --> 10199.96]  You can use it for like an air pod,
[10200.04 --> 10200.96]  little holder thing.
[10201.14 --> 10202.72]  There's definitely stuff you can use it for.
[10202.96 --> 10203.16]  Yep.
[10203.16 --> 10204.68]  Some people put cards in them.
[10204.86 --> 10205.50]  Small battery bank.
[10205.60 --> 10205.76]  Yep.
[10205.76 --> 10209.60]  Ahoy DLL.
[10209.86 --> 10214.48]  I noticed one of your recent videos had a generic voiceover correction.
[10214.48 --> 10215.84]  And I was wondering,
[10215.98 --> 10221.50]  what are your thoughts on using synthesized AI voiceovers for scenarios like this?
[10221.50 --> 10222.96]  It's super convenient.
[10223.92 --> 10227.84]  Like when I'm traveling and I'm not around to shoot a pickup,
[10227.92 --> 10229.80]  if they can just change a word with AI,
[10230.34 --> 10233.06]  that's sick.
[10233.22 --> 10233.82]  It's pretty sweet.
[10234.06 --> 10234.84]  Like realistically,
[10235.10 --> 10236.98]  no job is getting replaced,
[10237.70 --> 10237.94]  right?
[10237.94 --> 10239.14]  Like the job of,
[10239.24 --> 10240.32]  you know,
[10240.38 --> 10241.06]  holding a,
[10241.10 --> 10247.06]  holding a laptop running audacity or a little recorder thing in a mic under me is replaced
[10247.06 --> 10248.30]  by the job of,
[10248.44 --> 10249.06]  you know,
[10249.30 --> 10251.24]  entering the text in order to make that edit.
[10251.30 --> 10251.44]  Like,
[10251.46 --> 10252.94]  like nothing's being replaced.
[10252.98 --> 10256.92]  We're just doing it differently in a way that doesn't require me to come to set,
[10257.06 --> 10257.70]  uh,
[10257.70 --> 10258.36]  which is great.
[10258.68 --> 10259.12]  Love it.
[10259.66 --> 10260.54]  You'll see more of it.
[10262.06 --> 10262.58]  Or wait,
[10262.62 --> 10263.54]  you mean the generic one?
[10264.20 --> 10264.70]  Oh yeah.
[10264.70 --> 10267.54]  I'm not as big of a fan of like TikTok voice style ones.
[10268.04 --> 10268.42]  Um,
[10268.42 --> 10271.30]  but I think that the team likes to do it when they think it's funny.
[10271.64 --> 10273.88]  And that's just like a kind of humor I don't really get,
[10274.00 --> 10274.56]  but I,
[10274.74 --> 10275.26]  you know what?
[10275.28 --> 10279.10]  I don't like to stand in the way of just like silly little creative decisions like that.
[10279.10 --> 10279.88]  On the weekend,
[10280.12 --> 10284.12]  we went up to the stave lake power plant thing.
[10284.52 --> 10284.60]  The,
[10284.70 --> 10285.58]  you can do the tour.
[10285.72 --> 10286.66]  Pretty cool actually.
[10286.86 --> 10287.00]  But,
[10287.36 --> 10287.68]  um,
[10287.72 --> 10294.32]  afterwards I was dragged into an antique shop and the person working at the antique shop was
[10294.32 --> 10297.16]  listening to a fully,
[10297.26 --> 10298.00]  as far as I can tell,
[10298.10 --> 10300.66]  fully AI generated biography on someone.
[10301.10 --> 10303.48]  And I could tell the voice,
[10303.68 --> 10304.42]  I could hear it.
[10304.48 --> 10305.26]  So I could tell the,
[10305.26 --> 10306.44]  the second I heard the voice,
[10306.46 --> 10306.72]  I was like,
[10306.78 --> 10306.96]  Oh,
[10306.98 --> 10309.12]  that's like one of those generic AI voice things.
[10309.20 --> 10310.78]  And I told everyone that was with me.
[10311.08 --> 10311.56]  Um,
[10311.56 --> 10312.58]  and I kept listening to it,
[10312.62 --> 10313.28]  kept listening to it,
[10313.34 --> 10317.64]  determined that it was probably an AI script as well due to the,
[10317.98 --> 10319.46]  how it was worded and stuff.
[10319.88 --> 10320.64]  And then,
[10320.64 --> 10321.28]  uh,
[10321.28 --> 10325.12]  Emma was talking to the person and partway through the conversation they mentioned,
[10325.22 --> 10325.40]  like,
[10325.44 --> 10325.56]  yeah,
[10325.56 --> 10326.84]  I'm watching this biography thing.
[10326.96 --> 10328.08]  I think it might be fake,
[10328.18 --> 10329.00]  but I'm not sure.
[10330.22 --> 10330.90]  Oh man,
[10330.98 --> 10332.16]  we're so screwed.
[10332.72 --> 10333.46]  By the way,
[10333.58 --> 10335.04]  Sifrin in float plane chat says,
[10335.10 --> 10337.38]  why does everyone keep trying to pretend jobs aren't being replaced?
[10337.46 --> 10339.22]  Seems silly to pretend it's not going to happen.
[10339.26 --> 10339.86]  He's not doing that.
[10339.92 --> 10340.74]  That never happened.
[10341.06 --> 10342.68]  Context matters for crying out loud.
[10342.82 --> 10344.56]  Why are you trying to pretend that he said that?
[10344.56 --> 10347.18]  I'm talking about a very specific thing.
[10347.18 --> 10352.00]  When we are making an edit to our video with our team doing the work on our product,
[10352.18 --> 10352.68]  like it's,
[10353.16 --> 10353.40]  um,
[10353.44 --> 10356.90]  that is not a case where AI is,
[10356.94 --> 10357.20]  is,
[10357.20 --> 10358.26]  is taking our jobs,
[10358.26 --> 10360.92]  but that doesn't mean that I'm saying that that isn't going to happen.
[10360.98 --> 10361.32]  Absolutely.
[10361.40 --> 10361.78]  It's going to happen.
[10361.82 --> 10362.58]  It's happening now.
[10362.84 --> 10363.66]  It's already happened.
[10364.40 --> 10365.46]  And it will continue.
[10365.46 --> 10369.36]  For live,
[10369.50 --> 10369.72]  laugh,
[10369.78 --> 10370.32]  and dove,
[10370.78 --> 10371.90]  if you could have,
[10372.02 --> 10372.28]  uh,
[10372.28 --> 10376.62]  if you could eliminate all of one cuisine from each other's diet,
[10377.04 --> 10380.58]  which one would the fight for the most?
[10381.26 --> 10381.52]  Oh,
[10381.58 --> 10381.88]  I mean,
[10381.96 --> 10384.44]  Luke would not allow me to cut chicken out of his diet.
[10384.44 --> 10386.62]  I might as well tell him to just cut off his own head.
[10386.74 --> 10387.74]  What would I do?
[10388.12 --> 10388.82]  I don't know.
[10389.62 --> 10390.46]  Probably die.
[10391.30 --> 10391.70]  Well,
[10391.72 --> 10392.84]  you'd waste away first.
[10392.96 --> 10393.38]  If,
[10393.50 --> 10394.10]  and then die.
[10394.10 --> 10396.34]  If my diet had to stay exactly the same,
[10396.70 --> 10399.46]  like if I didn't get to change anything and you were able to remove chicken,
[10399.62 --> 10401.86]  I might actually just eventually.
[10402.38 --> 10402.56]  Yeah.
[10402.78 --> 10403.10]  Budgies.
[10404.92 --> 10406.32]  And when we talked about that earlier,
[10406.62 --> 10407.48]  he said chicken,
[10407.58 --> 10408.02]  not poultry.
[10408.24 --> 10409.08]  He said cuisine,
[10409.22 --> 10409.40]  Dan.
[10410.64 --> 10411.18]  We can,
[10411.22 --> 10413.20]  we can stop talking about eating budgies now.
[10413.40 --> 10413.76]  Wow.
[10413.76 --> 10414.16]  Um,
[10414.48 --> 10415.98]  sorry.
[10416.34 --> 10416.56]  Sorry.
[10416.56 --> 10417.24]  If you,
[10417.40 --> 10418.44]  if you could,
[10418.60 --> 10420.04]  if you could had to,
[10420.14 --> 10420.24]  okay,
[10420.24 --> 10421.72]  which one would I fight for the most?
[10422.06 --> 10422.60]  To eliminate.
[10422.70 --> 10424.08]  What's your favorite color of welcome?
[10424.10 --> 10424.24]  Yeah.
[10424.24 --> 10424.50]  You know,
[10424.54 --> 10424.82]  you gotta,
[10425.04 --> 10425.54]  you have to,
[10425.66 --> 10429.18]  you have to eliminate a cuisine from my diet.
[10429.32 --> 10430.44]  What would I fight for the most?
[10430.54 --> 10431.30]  What would you fight for the most?
[10431.72 --> 10431.92]  I think.
[10431.92 --> 10434.68]  Cuisine is an interesting word for the thing that I'm thinking of,
[10434.78 --> 10435.28]  but here,
[10435.34 --> 10435.56]  hold on.
[10435.66 --> 10436.96]  I'm going to write down my answer.
[10437.40 --> 10438.64]  Let's see if you can get it.
[10439.16 --> 10440.98]  Would chicken even be considered a cuisine?
[10441.26 --> 10441.44]  Oh,
[10441.58 --> 10442.16]  for Luke,
[10442.22 --> 10442.80]  it's a cuisine.
[10442.80 --> 10444.80]  I mean,
[10444.90 --> 10445.94]  Frank's red hot.
[10445.94 --> 10446.18]  Okay.
[10446.18 --> 10447.18]  Would be the most.
[10447.32 --> 10448.10]  Let's see if you can get it.
[10448.14 --> 10449.92]  What's the thing I would fight for most?
[10452.74 --> 10455.06]  The answer is going to be so obvious once you get it,
[10455.10 --> 10456.84]  that you're either going to get it and you're going to nail it.
[10456.88 --> 10457.34]  And you're going to be like,
[10457.40 --> 10457.54]  yeah,
[10457.54 --> 10457.90]  I know.
[10458.20 --> 10459.32]  Or you're going to knock at it.
[10459.34 --> 10459.74]  And you're going to be like,
[10459.78 --> 10460.52]  I'm a idiot.
[10461.02 --> 10462.32]  So those are the only two options.
[10462.32 --> 10462.74]  I'm afraid.
[10462.74 --> 10466.22]  I wonder if you know this though.
[10466.54 --> 10466.66]  Yeah.
[10466.68 --> 10468.90]  I don't feel like I'm that confident in this.
[10471.42 --> 10474.94]  Cause there's quite a few things that he's fairly passionate about in
[10474.94 --> 10476.00]  regards to food actually.
[10476.70 --> 10478.30]  And they're quite different.
[10479.96 --> 10480.44]  Cuisine.
[10481.16 --> 10482.72]  How are we defining cuisine?
[10483.56 --> 10483.92]  Loosely.
[10484.34 --> 10484.68]  Okay.
[10484.94 --> 10485.12]  Yeah.
[10485.12 --> 10485.92]  I'm not worrying about it.
[10490.62 --> 10491.06]  Yeah.
[10491.10 --> 10491.52]  I don't know.
[10491.52 --> 10492.44]  I feel like I'm wrong,
[10492.44 --> 10493.96]  but I just default to cereal.
[10494.08 --> 10495.14]  The first thing I thought it was cereal.
[10497.76 --> 10498.08]  Yeah.
[10498.14 --> 10498.38]  Okay.
[10499.12 --> 10499.44]  Yeah.
[10500.42 --> 10502.76]  Because the other contender that I had was pickles,
[10502.90 --> 10503.26]  but I was like,
[10503.28 --> 10504.88]  I feel like it's not on the same level.
[10505.02 --> 10505.18]  Yeah.
[10505.24 --> 10505.48]  No,
[10505.96 --> 10506.94]  it's high.
[10507.32 --> 10508.02]  I like pickles,
[10508.16 --> 10508.46]  but I'll,
[10508.46 --> 10510.10]  I'll go six months without eating a pickle.
[10510.46 --> 10510.48]  Yeah,
[10510.48 --> 10510.90]  exactly.
[10511.10 --> 10512.12]  And I've seen that happen.
[10512.14 --> 10513.96]  If I go a week without eating cereal,
[10513.96 --> 10516.06]  the first thing I do when I walk in the door at home,
[10516.10 --> 10518.62]  like sometimes I don't even say hi to all of my family members.
[10519.68 --> 10522.08]  I will go and eat a bowl of honey nut Cheerios or like
[10522.08 --> 10524.44]  honey nut Chax or whatever,
[10524.60 --> 10526.32]  whatever I'm into that at that point.
[10526.40 --> 10526.62]  Like,
[10526.68 --> 10526.88]  I'm,
[10527.02 --> 10527.60]  I like,
[10527.74 --> 10528.18]  um,
[10529.26 --> 10530.82]  I was less confident until you said,
[10530.92 --> 10534.66]  I was less confident until you said that we were loosely defining it as,
[10534.66 --> 10535.90]  uh,
[10535.98 --> 10537.42]  loosely defining cuisine.
[10537.42 --> 10537.92]  Cause I was like,
[10537.92 --> 10538.98]  is he talking about burgers?
[10539.06 --> 10540.70]  Maybe like his own burgers.
[10540.70 --> 10540.98]  Yeah.
[10540.98 --> 10542.34]  I like some of that oatmeal crisp,
[10542.34 --> 10543.66]  like wild berry,
[10543.80 --> 10545.12]  but I'll throw in like extra cranberries.
[10545.12 --> 10546.06]  You can tell it's not burgers.
[10546.06 --> 10548.80]  Cause he completely ignored that and just kept talking about cereal.
[10548.80 --> 10549.16]  You know what?
[10549.34 --> 10551.76]  I was going to write down would also accept burgers.
[10552.12 --> 10552.46]  Cause like,
[10552.46 --> 10552.66]  okay.
[10552.66 --> 10553.32]  All right.
[10553.38 --> 10554.60]  So I sort of,
[10554.60 --> 10555.62]  sort of got it,
[10555.62 --> 10559.80]  but I think the burgers is half of it's the act of making them.
[10559.80 --> 10561.86]  Yeah.
[10562.26 --> 10562.66]  Yeah.
[10562.80 --> 10563.02]  Yeah.
[10563.02 --> 10563.32]  I mean,
[10563.42 --> 10564.46]  I don't know what I would,
[10564.52 --> 10566.10]  I don't know what I would like serve guests.
[10566.10 --> 10566.92]  Cause yeah,
[10566.92 --> 10569.46]  I don't personally like chicken wings that much for like,
[10569.46 --> 10570.60]  like drumsticks and stuff,
[10570.60 --> 10572.38]  but like that's such a barbecue staple.
[10572.56 --> 10574.54]  So if I couldn't throw burgers on the grill,
[10574.66 --> 10574.80]  man,
[10574.86 --> 10575.70]  what would I even like,
[10575.88 --> 10576.88]  like hot dogs really?
[10576.98 --> 10578.06]  Like it's fine for some people.
[10578.12 --> 10579.20]  Not everyone likes hot dogs.
[10579.66 --> 10583.18]  Whereas like if you have hot dogs and hamburgers and you offer a veggie version of
[10583.18 --> 10585.38]  both pretty much everyone is going to eat.
[10585.48 --> 10586.28]  Nobody's going to be like,
[10586.74 --> 10587.00]  nah,
[10587.18 --> 10588.04]  I'm a leave hungry.
[10588.32 --> 10588.50]  Yeah.
[10589.38 --> 10589.78]  Yeah.
[10589.80 --> 10590.20]  Yeah.
[10591.00 --> 10591.40]  Yeah.
[10591.88 --> 10593.06]  I have no idea for Dan.
[10593.98 --> 10597.14]  As far as I can tell that Dan will happily just literally eat nothing.
[10597.40 --> 10597.56]  So I,
[10598.00 --> 10599.44]  shut up,
[10599.64 --> 10601.06]  shut your mouth.
[10602.28 --> 10602.94]  So it's like,
[10603.00 --> 10603.60]  what do you,
[10603.70 --> 10603.94]  what do you,
[10604.02 --> 10604.04]  what do you,
[10604.04 --> 10605.94]  what do you threaten him to take away?
[10606.08 --> 10606.78]  It's not food,
[10606.90 --> 10607.14]  Dan.
[10607.22 --> 10607.98]  That's not cuisine.
[10608.18 --> 10608.26]  Well,
[10608.26 --> 10608.98]  it's my breakfast.
[10610.18 --> 10610.32]  Oh,
[10610.42 --> 10611.04]  I almost got Luke.
[10612.24 --> 10613.50]  There's no water in here.
[10613.58 --> 10613.84]  No,
[10614.12 --> 10615.18]  I forgot to give you water.
[10615.52 --> 10616.68]  My one chance.
[10617.44 --> 10617.80]  No.
[10618.68 --> 10619.24]  Got him.
[10619.24 --> 10620.04]  Uh,
[10620.60 --> 10621.30]  souls.
[10621.92 --> 10622.12]  Hey,
[10622.42 --> 10624.00]  Hey,
[10624.12 --> 10624.42]  DLL.
[10625.50 --> 10626.18]  First off,
[10626.22 --> 10626.58]  great name,
[10626.64 --> 10626.84]  Dan.
[10626.92 --> 10627.12]  Thanks,
[10627.18 --> 10627.36]  Dan.
[10627.96 --> 10628.40]  Second,
[10628.52 --> 10630.06]  great question for Linus.
[10630.22 --> 10633.32]  I'm moving apartment soon and we'll be repainting it.
[10633.40 --> 10634.30]  That's not really a question.
[10635.30 --> 10637.52]  What advice do you have for that?
[10637.62 --> 10638.48]  Satin or eggshell?
[10638.70 --> 10639.96]  How do I prep the walls?
[10640.58 --> 10640.78]  Oh,
[10640.82 --> 10641.10]  all right.
[10641.16 --> 10641.46]  Well,
[10641.60 --> 10642.00]  um,
[10642.60 --> 10645.10]  the product that people use for prepping the walls,
[10645.18 --> 10648.10]  I think it's called TSP for a wall prep.
[10648.76 --> 10649.20]  Um,
[10649.40 --> 10649.70]  yeah,
[10649.70 --> 10650.08]  there you go.
[10650.08 --> 10651.26]  To clean walls with TSP,
[10651.58 --> 10651.68]  blah,
[10651.72 --> 10651.82]  blah,
[10651.88 --> 10652.12]  blah,
[10652.22 --> 10653.32]  bucket of warm water.
[10653.98 --> 10654.36]  Um,
[10654.36 --> 10657.56]  it's better than using bleach because there are certain kinds of,
[10657.60 --> 10659.56]  I think it's mildew that will actually eat,
[10659.56 --> 10660.34]  uh,
[10660.34 --> 10661.40]  compounds in bleach.
[10661.40 --> 10663.70]  So you can actually end up like having more mildew.
[10663.76 --> 10664.20]  With that said,
[10664.20 --> 10664.56]  if you have,
[10664.56 --> 10666.48]  if you have mildew on your interior walls,
[10666.54 --> 10667.10]  that's probably,
[10667.34 --> 10667.56]  um,
[10667.80 --> 10669.82]  you probably got other issues and you're talking,
[10669.90 --> 10670.00]  yeah,
[10670.00 --> 10670.20]  I think,
[10670.24 --> 10671.74]  I think you're talking about interior walls.
[10672.04 --> 10674.20]  So the first thing you want to do is just wipe,
[10674.20 --> 10674.92]  wipe down the walls.
[10675.14 --> 10675.46]  Um,
[10675.94 --> 10676.62]  lightly,
[10676.98 --> 10679.28]  lightly soapy water will work to wipe them down.
[10679.36 --> 10680.14]  Just whatever you do,
[10680.20 --> 10682.28]  do not leave a soap film on them.
[10682.32 --> 10684.00]  You've got to make sure that you get that off.
[10684.30 --> 10685.10]  And then,
[10685.10 --> 10686.28]  um,
[10686.40 --> 10687.14]  after that,
[10687.20 --> 10688.64]  I would say,
[10688.82 --> 10689.66]  you know,
[10689.66 --> 10691.08]  figure out what kind of paints on there.
[10691.12 --> 10692.22]  If it's a really old house,
[10692.22 --> 10693.74]  it might have oil based paint,
[10693.78 --> 10696.94]  which means that you'll have to pick a special product that is designed to go
[10696.94 --> 10698.02]  over top of oil based paint.
[10698.10 --> 10701.06]  Almost nobody paints with oil inside the house anymore.
[10701.72 --> 10705.64]  And certain latex products will just peel right off of an oil paint.
[10705.74 --> 10706.78]  Like they won't adhere at all.
[10706.92 --> 10708.96]  So make sure that you figure out what's on there.
[10708.96 --> 10710.64]  You can use a little bit of acetone on a rag.
[10710.70 --> 10711.42]  If it comes off,
[10711.46 --> 10712.34]  it's latex based.
[10712.40 --> 10713.24]  If it doesn't come off,
[10713.28 --> 10714.00]  then it's oil based.
[10714.08 --> 10714.88]  You got to watch out for that.
[10714.94 --> 10715.90]  Just let the paint store know.
[10716.16 --> 10717.30]  And then beyond that,
[10717.64 --> 10717.92]  I mean,
[10718.00 --> 10719.54]  satin versus eggshell is just a finish,
[10719.60 --> 10719.78]  right?
[10719.80 --> 10721.18]  So you got to decide on a product.
[10721.76 --> 10722.16]  Um,
[10722.16 --> 10722.66]  I would just,
[10722.84 --> 10724.66]  I would say avoid,
[10724.80 --> 10727.08]  avoid cheap paint,
[10727.54 --> 10729.02]  get a good quality paint,
[10729.08 --> 10732.16]  one that has good coverage and buy less of it.
[10732.22 --> 10734.36]  Cause you'll find that a lot of the time,
[10734.48 --> 10737.22]  the cheaper product is just going to cover worse.
[10737.22 --> 10739.30]  And you're going to end up doing another coat of it anyway.
[10739.54 --> 10739.76]  Oh,
[10740.76 --> 10741.26]  um,
[10741.38 --> 10742.94]  I like eggshell finish for walls.
[10743.04 --> 10744.22]  I like semi-gloss for trim.
[10744.32 --> 10744.66]  Very,
[10744.78 --> 10745.42]  very traditional,
[10745.66 --> 10745.90]  very,
[10746.02 --> 10746.78]  very classic.
[10747.00 --> 10747.18]  I mean,
[10747.18 --> 10748.78]  people obviously do other things.
[10748.78 --> 10750.44]  If I was painting a bathroom or a kitchen,
[10750.44 --> 10753.12]  I would consider a glossier coating,
[10753.12 --> 10755.32]  even for the walls just to make it more scrubbable.
[10755.74 --> 10758.22]  But basically you can either have,
[10758.94 --> 10760.58]  like there's different kinds of,
[10760.58 --> 10760.94]  um,
[10761.00 --> 10761.38]  additives.
[10761.48 --> 10765.22]  You can only suspend so much in the paint suspension.
[10765.80 --> 10766.04]  Um,
[10766.04 --> 10766.98]  so you can add,
[10767.06 --> 10767.82]  uh,
[10768.36 --> 10769.46]  coloring pigments.
[10769.58 --> 10771.34]  You can add blocking pigments,
[10771.40 --> 10771.72]  which will,
[10771.84 --> 10772.94]  which will cover up what's underneath,
[10773.04 --> 10773.90]  which will help them to,
[10773.96 --> 10774.64]  to cover better.
[10775.06 --> 10775.34]  Uh,
[10775.34 --> 10776.20]  you can add,
[10776.20 --> 10776.64]  um,
[10776.74 --> 10777.12]  resin.
[10777.86 --> 10779.84]  There's only so much you can suspend in it.
[10779.92 --> 10781.86]  And so when you have these different finishes,
[10781.86 --> 10782.74]  uh,
[10782.76 --> 10783.46]  the more,
[10783.46 --> 10784.38]  uh,
[10784.42 --> 10786.06]  the more resin you have in it,
[10786.26 --> 10786.48]  uh,
[10786.48 --> 10788.98]  one of the nice things about it is the,
[10789.14 --> 10790.68]  the more durable it is.
[10790.78 --> 10792.18]  Resin's really good for,
[10792.18 --> 10792.58]  uh,
[10792.58 --> 10793.34]  hardening it,
[10793.46 --> 10794.76]  but it makes it more glossy.
[10794.98 --> 10796.22]  And the glossier it is,
[10796.24 --> 10797.58]  the more it shows imperfections.
[10797.62 --> 10798.64]  So that's why eggshell,
[10798.74 --> 10799.66]  which is not a color,
[10799.66 --> 10802.12]  it is the texture of an egg shell.
[10802.72 --> 10802.96]  Um,
[10802.96 --> 10804.86]  and it has like a little bit of sheen to it,
[10804.92 --> 10805.98]  but it's mostly flat.
[10805.98 --> 10811.14]  That's why it's a really nice middle ground between being durable enough to scrub with a,
[10811.20 --> 10812.08]  with a washcloth,
[10812.16 --> 10813.40]  but also,
[10813.40 --> 10814.54]  um,
[10815.42 --> 10817.58]  matte enough that it hides imperfections.
[10817.64 --> 10817.70]  Well,
[10817.74 --> 10820.70]  you wouldn't believe how not flat your drywall is.
[10821.18 --> 10822.18]  It's not flat.
[10822.28 --> 10826.54]  I promise you it looks like no matter who your contractors are and no matter how fresh the job was,
[10826.56 --> 10827.70]  it looks like it's terrible.
[10828.00 --> 10828.40]  And,
[10828.48 --> 10828.96]  and that's,
[10829.06 --> 10829.82]  that's not their fault.
[10829.96 --> 10833.68]  Sheetrock's really hard to deal with and getting it extremely flat is,
[10833.78 --> 10834.74]  I forget what,
[10834.90 --> 10835.24]  cause I,
[10835.28 --> 10835.66]  I had,
[10835.74 --> 10835.96]  um,
[10835.98 --> 10843.58]  talked to our contractors about how we have these sconces in our theater room and they shine down and you can really see the like bulges in the walls.
[10843.70 --> 10844.90]  You can see where the mud is.
[10845.16 --> 10845.36]  Yeah.
[10845.42 --> 10845.84]  Um,
[10845.84 --> 10849.46]  between the drywall sheets because of just the angle of the light.
[10849.50 --> 10849.76]  I'm like,
[10849.82 --> 10849.98]  Hey,
[10850.02 --> 10851.44]  so this wall isn't very flat.
[10851.44 --> 10851.96]  And they're like,
[10852.02 --> 10852.20]  yeah,
[10852.20 --> 10853.92]  I'm like,
[10853.98 --> 10854.10]  right,
[10854.14 --> 10855.08]  but it's not very flat.
[10855.20 --> 10855.54]  And they're like,
[10855.62 --> 10855.74]  yeah,
[10855.74 --> 10856.72]  but if you want it flat,
[10856.80 --> 10857.20]  that's called,
[10857.28 --> 10859.74]  I think it's called like a level four finish or something like that.
[10859.74 --> 10860.56]  And they're basically like,
[10860.60 --> 10860.74]  yeah,
[10860.80 --> 10863.66]  it takes like 10 times as long or something like that.
[10863.66 --> 10864.32]  You want to pay for it?
[10864.32 --> 10864.50]  I'm like,
[10864.56 --> 10864.76]  nah,
[10864.76 --> 10865.94]  like,
[10865.94 --> 10866.20]  okay,
[10866.36 --> 10866.88]  then,
[10866.94 --> 10867.10]  uh,
[10867.10 --> 10867.86]  then I think we've,
[10867.86 --> 10868.10]  uh,
[10868.16 --> 10870.90]  then I think we've reached a conclusion here.
[10870.98 --> 10871.22]  Yeah.
[10871.72 --> 10872.16]  Um,
[10872.80 --> 10873.44]  so,
[10873.44 --> 10874.22]  so that's,
[10874.28 --> 10876.96]  that's what eggshells for is it'll help hide those imperfections.
[10877.56 --> 10877.96]  Um,
[10877.96 --> 10879.86]  I use high gloss for anything you're going to touch.
[10879.86 --> 10881.88]  So like a banister or railing,
[10881.98 --> 10882.72]  anything like that,
[10882.74 --> 10884.10]  you should be using a high gloss paint.
[10884.32 --> 10885.78]  He didn't say it was particularly durable.
[10885.88 --> 10886.94]  He said it was a happy medium.
[10887.18 --> 10887.40]  Yeah.
[10887.94 --> 10888.30]  Guys,
[10888.44 --> 10889.12]  it's durable enough.
[10889.20 --> 10889.32]  Why,
[10889.42 --> 10890.68]  what is the point of saying?
[10890.68 --> 10891.74]  I said a thing I didn't say,
[10891.88 --> 10891.92]  man,
[10891.98 --> 10893.32]  the number of times,
[10893.40 --> 10893.58]  man,
[10893.58 --> 10894.50]  I read on the internet,
[10894.50 --> 10898.46]  a thing that I said that I completely never said at all.
[10898.86 --> 10900.66]  It's actually kind of incredible.
[10900.94 --> 10902.52]  I say so much stuff.
[10902.68 --> 10904.20]  It's so easy to nail me on stuff.
[10904.26 --> 10904.74]  I've said,
[10904.74 --> 10907.78]  why go for the stuff I didn't say?
[10908.78 --> 10909.88]  What's the point?
[10910.78 --> 10911.64]  Oh man.
[10911.90 --> 10912.80]  It's pretty funny.
[10913.32 --> 10913.68]  Anyway,
[10914.08 --> 10914.50]  um,
[10914.58 --> 10915.04]  have fun.
[10915.44 --> 10915.70]  You know,
[10915.70 --> 10916.42]  it's a fun project.
[10916.54 --> 10917.28]  Put down drop sheets.
[10917.56 --> 10919.52]  There is no such thing as a job.
[10919.58 --> 10920.18]  That's so small.
[10920.24 --> 10921.78]  You shouldn't bother to put down a drop sheet.
[10924.84 --> 10925.32]  Hi,
[10925.40 --> 10928.18]  Dan's hands and Linus and Luke's voice.
[10928.18 --> 10933.64]  If you were given the ability to advance one piece of technology or breakthrough,
[10933.94 --> 10935.04]  what would you progress?
[10935.46 --> 10935.98]  For example,
[10936.14 --> 10936.90]  battery technology,
[10937.14 --> 10938.08]  hydrogen fuel cells.
[10942.32 --> 10945.00]  The two examples that they gave were fantastic.
[10945.24 --> 10945.32]  Yeah.
[10945.36 --> 10945.82]  That's like,
[10945.90 --> 10946.32]  honestly,
[10946.36 --> 10947.38]  I would have taken batteries.
[10947.98 --> 10948.42]  Yeah.
[10949.12 --> 10949.54]  Fine.
[10949.58 --> 10951.30]  I'm going to go with screens then.
[10952.02 --> 10955.98]  I would make them so much more power efficient that I don't need as much battery.
[10956.86 --> 10957.18]  Hey,
[10957.18 --> 10958.58]  I turned it around.
[10958.66 --> 10959.64]  It's basically batteries now.
[10959.84 --> 10960.22]  Got them.
[10960.86 --> 10964.82]  I was going to go with a more kind of broader tech and just,
[10964.82 --> 10966.42]  uh,
[10966.74 --> 10972.56]  mixed reality glasses that look like normal glasses that actually look like normal glasses.
[10972.68 --> 10972.78]  You know,
[10972.80 --> 10973.04]  it's funny.
[10973.10 --> 10975.14]  That's the product that I had in mind when I said screens.
[10975.34 --> 10975.90]  There you go.
[10976.02 --> 10976.26]  Nice.
[10976.32 --> 10977.08]  On the same wavelength.
[10977.24 --> 10977.74]  Heck yeah.
[10978.30 --> 10979.60]  Computer brain interfaces.
[10980.26 --> 10980.50]  Hey,
[10980.70 --> 10982.16]  LLDXC.
[10982.16 --> 10983.46]  OTR trucker here.
[10983.94 --> 10984.18]  Uh,
[10984.18 --> 10986.32]  just got my tax write-off t-shirt.
[10986.68 --> 10988.50]  It's officially a work shirt for a write-off.
[10989.06 --> 10989.22]  Nice.
[10989.22 --> 10990.90]  If you had to live out of a semi-truck,
[10991.00 --> 10992.60]  what tech would you take with you?
[10992.86 --> 10993.64]  Loving the ally.
[10994.68 --> 10995.06]  Thank you.
[10995.12 --> 10996.60]  They took my answer again.
[10996.70 --> 10996.98]  I would say,
[10996.98 --> 11000.34]  gosh darn it.
[11000.38 --> 11000.56]  I mean,
[11000.56 --> 11004.50]  I would definitely take like whatever the baller Starlink is if I can get away with it.
[11004.72 --> 11007.98]  Like having actually good internet on the road would be.
[11008.34 --> 11009.08]  Pretty big deal.
[11009.20 --> 11010.62]  A huge deal for me.
[11010.80 --> 11011.64]  The ally is sick.
[11011.72 --> 11011.96]  Yeah.
[11012.32 --> 11012.72]  Um,
[11017.36 --> 11017.68]  how much,
[11017.74 --> 11018.46]  how much like,
[11018.46 --> 11022.76]  I guess you're usually when you're stopped,
[11022.82 --> 11025.02]  you're going to be stopped at a stop,
[11025.16 --> 11027.52]  like a truck stop or a destination or some kind.
[11027.60 --> 11027.94]  I'm assuming.
[11028.16 --> 11028.76]  Yes and no.
[11028.96 --> 11030.72]  Like sometimes you're just on the side of the road.
[11030.84 --> 11031.72]  You're in the pullover.
[11031.76 --> 11033.64]  How much power do you have when you're stopped there?
[11034.10 --> 11034.58]  I mean,
[11034.60 --> 11035.36]  that's a good question.
[11035.44 --> 11037.02]  I've never driven a big rig professionally,
[11037.24 --> 11037.80]  believe it or not.
[11037.92 --> 11038.18]  Yeah.
[11038.38 --> 11038.86]  I don't know.
[11039.20 --> 11039.54]  Paint house.
[11039.68 --> 11039.96]  Yes.
[11041.08 --> 11041.64]  Big rig.
[11042.16 --> 11042.52]  No.
[11042.66 --> 11042.84]  Yeah.
[11042.84 --> 11043.48]  Not so much.
[11043.60 --> 11044.02]  Cause I'd,
[11044.20 --> 11047.94]  most of the people that I've talked to that do this type of stuff have battery powered
[11047.94 --> 11048.54]  things,
[11048.54 --> 11053.44]  which makes me think that you're charging them at a truck stop or something and then
[11053.44 --> 11055.32]  potentially using them when you're not there.
[11055.40 --> 11057.76]  So you probably don't have a ton of power available.
[11058.38 --> 11058.82]  Um,
[11058.94 --> 11060.64]  unless you're running your truck,
[11060.66 --> 11062.72]  which you probably don't want to just waste all that fuel.
[11063.50 --> 11063.94]  Um,
[11064.08 --> 11065.24]  probably not.
[11065.32 --> 11065.56]  Yeah,
[11065.64 --> 11066.26]  probably not.
[11066.84 --> 11067.28]  Um,
[11067.90 --> 11070.10]  I could see electric trucks being kind of cool for that.
[11070.10 --> 11070.50]  Actually,
[11070.68 --> 11073.48]  the allies probably kind of killing it right there.
[11076.28 --> 11076.68]  Wow.
[11076.88 --> 11077.56]  Cop out answer.
[11078.34 --> 11078.70]  Well,
[11078.72 --> 11079.06]  I'm kind of,
[11079.12 --> 11080.22]  I'm thinking cause like you,
[11080.36 --> 11080.66]  I've,
[11080.66 --> 11085.30]  I've seen people have like playstations and TVs in their rigs when they,
[11085.36 --> 11086.68]  when they have like the bed set up,
[11086.86 --> 11087.16]  you know,
[11087.34 --> 11088.08]  and they have those ones,
[11088.12 --> 11088.98]  not all of them have those,
[11089.02 --> 11089.38]  but when,
[11089.46 --> 11090.46]  when you have like the bed set up,
[11090.52 --> 11091.98]  you've seen like at the foot of the bed,
[11092.02 --> 11093.50]  there's a TV and they have a PlayStation there.
[11093.56 --> 11094.32]  And that's pretty cool.
[11094.34 --> 11095.30]  I've seen that a few different times.
[11095.58 --> 11099.58]  One thing that I've always kind of wondered about is why you don't see like
[11099.58 --> 11100.24]  some crazy,
[11100.44 --> 11101.78]  maybe I just haven't seen it,
[11101.78 --> 11105.12]  but like a PC gamer guy who has his truck set up,
[11105.16 --> 11105.94]  but there's a computer.
[11106.90 --> 11108.34]  The power draw is pretty high.
[11108.46 --> 11109.60]  I think you just wouldn't see it.
[11109.60 --> 11110.08]  Cause I know,
[11110.20 --> 11112.84]  I definitely know of some that have NASes in their trucks,
[11112.92 --> 11113.38]  for example,
[11113.54 --> 11114.60]  to carry media around.
[11114.72 --> 11115.08]  Okay.
[11115.40 --> 11116.12]  That's kind of sick.
[11116.12 --> 11118.34]  Like I would definitely have a NAS in my truck.
[11118.92 --> 11119.58]  That's pretty cool.
[11119.78 --> 11121.58]  Especially if I didn't have my Starlink.
[11121.62 --> 11122.18]  If I have Starlink,
[11122.22 --> 11123.24]  I don't need it as much,
[11123.24 --> 11124.20]  but if I didn't,
[11124.34 --> 11127.78]  that's my backup is I would have like a sick NAS with a whole bunch of media.
[11128.22 --> 11128.40]  Okay.
[11128.42 --> 11131.14]  The sleeper trucks have a small diesel generator on them,
[11131.20 --> 11132.38]  providing 1500 Watts.
[11132.42 --> 11133.62]  Usually interesting.
[11135.08 --> 11135.48]  Interesting.
[11135.48 --> 11137.48]  I feel like,
[11137.64 --> 11137.76]  yeah,
[11137.80 --> 11138.80]  I am still copping out,
[11138.88 --> 11141.12]  but I feel like the ally is just kind of a sick option.
[11141.66 --> 11142.40]  It is.
[11142.50 --> 11142.70]  Sorry.
[11142.84 --> 11143.18]  It is.
[11143.52 --> 11143.96]  Hey,
[11143.98 --> 11145.48]  we've got updates for smash champs.
[11146.60 --> 11147.28]  What's that?
[11147.84 --> 11148.66]  What's that?
[11150.10 --> 11151.26]  Look at that.
[11151.54 --> 11153.96]  A sneak peek at our concession and seating area.
[11154.76 --> 11156.78]  So this will be the concession.
[11157.02 --> 11159.06]  And then it looks like a normal kitchen.
[11160.02 --> 11160.50]  Look.
[11160.90 --> 11161.18]  All right.
[11161.20 --> 11162.52]  We didn't reinvent kitchens.
[11162.70 --> 11163.26]  I'm sorry.
[11164.24 --> 11165.28]  Didn't even innovate.
[11165.54 --> 11167.50]  This will be a small seating area.
[11169.68 --> 11170.78]  What else we got?
[11170.92 --> 11171.16]  Oh,
[11171.24 --> 11171.94]  we got more stuff.
[11172.82 --> 11173.34]  What's this?
[11173.42 --> 11174.50]  Is this the viewing area?
[11174.58 --> 11175.92]  This is the retail store.
[11176.24 --> 11176.36]  Oh,
[11176.44 --> 11176.88]  no downstairs.
[11176.88 --> 11177.06]  Yeah.
[11177.12 --> 11178.76]  So there's our slot wall.
[11178.94 --> 11179.72]  So we're going to put.
[11179.72 --> 11180.64]  What's the yellow thing?
[11180.70 --> 11181.46]  Products on there.
[11181.88 --> 11184.30]  That is a light for the construction.
[11184.50 --> 11184.68]  Oh,
[11184.92 --> 11185.26]  okay.
[11185.66 --> 11185.84]  Yep.
[11187.38 --> 11187.76]  Nice.
[11188.74 --> 11189.14]  Nice.
[11189.14 --> 11190.84]  All the audio stuff came in this week.
[11190.84 --> 11191.18]  Restringer.
[11191.28 --> 11192.34]  Our stringing machine.
[11192.70 --> 11193.32]  Did you just have one?
[11193.48 --> 11193.96]  We got two.
[11194.28 --> 11194.60]  Nice.
[11197.24 --> 11199.06]  Are you still going to string your own rackets?
[11199.48 --> 11199.78]  No.
[11201.94 --> 11202.38]  Man,
[11202.50 --> 11205.04]  I'm going to use my owner privilege so hard.
[11206.22 --> 11206.92]  And be like,
[11207.18 --> 11207.66]  hey guys,
[11207.74 --> 11209.46]  do you mind taking care of one of these rackets for me?
[11210.04 --> 11210.74]  And then I'll pay.
[11210.74 --> 11214.38]  Is that going to affect the manager's numbers?
[11214.92 --> 11215.40]  It shouldn't.
[11215.50 --> 11215.82]  I'll pay.
[11216.16 --> 11216.54]  It's fine.
[11216.54 --> 11216.94]  Nice.
[11218.00 --> 11220.32]  But I like might expect it to be done pretty quickly.
[11221.00 --> 11222.72]  What should you probably shouldn't pay?
[11223.62 --> 11225.44]  They should just track how many times you do it.
[11225.46 --> 11226.58]  Cause then you're just giving,
[11226.78 --> 11227.06]  you're just,
[11227.20 --> 11228.54]  it's just more taxes for no reason.
[11228.58 --> 11229.38]  That's true actually.
[11230.20 --> 11233.28]  But technically I'm supposed to pay those taxes.
[11233.42 --> 11235.60]  That is definitely a personal badminton racket.
[11237.50 --> 11238.34]  Nevermind.
[11239.28 --> 11240.68]  Of course you should pay.
[11241.62 --> 11242.38]  Very good.
[11242.38 --> 11246.32]  Not financial advice.
[11250.84 --> 11251.28]  Yes.
[11251.56 --> 11251.74]  More?
[11252.50 --> 11252.92]  Yes.
[11253.04 --> 11253.40]  Luck.
[11253.68 --> 11256.98]  I see you're going to be attending OpenSauce this year.
[11257.38 --> 11261.60]  Are there any specific open source programs or platforms that you're hyped to see being developed?
[11261.60 --> 11266.12]  Uh, so many of them.
[11266.20 --> 11266.84]  FFmpeg?
[11267.08 --> 11268.54]  It's like so underrated.
[11269.30 --> 11275.96]  It, it, it runs like so many things and you don't hear people really talk about it very often.
[11276.18 --> 11280.54]  You just hear people talk about like, I mean, we talk about Flowplane and maybe I don't mention it enough.
[11280.54 --> 11282.10]  So I'm trying to give it credit right now.
[11282.60 --> 11286.78]  Uh, but FFmpeg is like incredibly amazing.
[11287.30 --> 11292.24]  Um, and our, our internet offerings would be a lot worse without it.
[11292.34 --> 11293.04]  I'll say that much.
[11293.24 --> 11296.18]  Um, so there, I'll say that one.
[11296.30 --> 11298.62]  I'm always excited when they keep pushing things forward.
[11298.62 --> 11307.10]  So I'm guessing I fell for your cunning plan when I submitted that dead pixel bug report.
[11307.48 --> 11311.10]  What are your favorite examples of Easter eggs like this on websites?
[11312.46 --> 11312.86]  Hmm.
[11313.68 --> 11318.94]  I always loved the little dinosaur jump game that you could play when a page didn't load in Chrome.
[11320.12 --> 11321.50]  I think that was probably my personal favorite.
[11321.72 --> 11322.62]  In the past, isn't it still a thing?
[11322.74 --> 11323.02]  Maybe.
[11323.24 --> 11325.34]  I think somebody made a multiplayer version of it.
[11325.92 --> 11327.50]  I can't remember if that was a thing.
[11327.70 --> 11328.50]  Maybe I'm crazy.
[11328.62 --> 11328.80]  Okay.
[11330.36 --> 11331.68]  Play Chrome Dino game.
[11331.92 --> 11332.78]  Press space to play.
[11334.14 --> 11334.58]  Yeah.
[11334.84 --> 11335.26]  There you go.
[11335.30 --> 11339.04]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[11339.46 --> 11340.86]  Chrome Dino multiplayer.
[11341.20 --> 11341.64]  Look at that.
[11342.62 --> 11343.16]  No way.
[11345.32 --> 11346.34]  This feels too easy.
[11347.14 --> 11347.84]  It gets harder, right?
[11348.44 --> 11349.88]  Didn't somebody make a hot dog to play?
[11350.56 --> 11350.96]  Yeah.
[11352.30 --> 11352.74]  Yeah.
[11352.74 --> 11357.56]  Somebody like mechanically automated a, basically a cheat for the game.
[11357.56 --> 11358.68]  And then I think he got a job.
[11358.68 --> 11358.96]  Seriously?
[11359.46 --> 11359.64]  Yeah.
[11359.84 --> 11360.60]  I think they hired him.
[11360.68 --> 11361.36]  That's amazing.
[11362.44 --> 11362.62]  Man.
[11362.78 --> 11363.02]  Internet.
[11363.02 --> 11367.52]  I think it was just a sensor on the screen that when it detected the like darker color.
[11368.02 --> 11368.28]  Yeah.
[11368.28 --> 11369.26]  But you gotta, you gotta jump.
[11369.34 --> 11369.88]  You gotta crouch.
[11370.02 --> 11371.26]  You gotta, uh, do an input.
[11371.26 --> 11371.92]  It gets faster.
[11371.92 --> 11372.50]  Can you crouch?
[11372.64 --> 11373.26]  Is there crouching?
[11373.42 --> 11373.58]  Yeah.
[11373.64 --> 11374.86]  You gotta duck under things.
[11374.86 --> 11377.32]  Uh, I can't look at my arrow keys right now.
[11378.04 --> 11379.44]  It's just a down arrow.
[11380.10 --> 11381.96]  Uh, I can't see them though.
[11381.98 --> 11383.22]  I didn't know you had to, are you sure you have to crouch?
[11383.22 --> 11384.48]  I don't think you can crouch, Dan.
[11384.66 --> 11384.96]  Mm-hmm.
[11385.26 --> 11385.98]  Are you messing with me?
[11385.98 --> 11387.06]  What is happening right now?
[11387.14 --> 11387.24]  Okay.
[11387.24 --> 11387.72]  I've never seen it.
[11387.72 --> 11388.22]  Dark mode.
[11388.22 --> 11388.28]  Oh.
[11392.86 --> 11394.64]  Dude, he's gaming right now.
[11394.90 --> 11395.62]  So sweaty.
[11395.80 --> 11397.56]  Did you guys know this is the guy that beat Ludwig?
[11397.56 --> 11399.36]  Shut up.
[11401.16 --> 11401.52]  Dick.
[11403.62 --> 11405.98]  Someone should challenge him to this dino jump game.
[11408.44 --> 11410.54]  I wonder what the high score is for this.
[11410.76 --> 11411.08]  It's probably absurd.
[11411.08 --> 11412.36]  Whatever it is, it's embarrassing.
[11412.74 --> 11415.72]  Well, I think they've made the bot that just does it, right?
[11415.82 --> 11417.10]  So like, are you gonna beat the bot?
[11417.18 --> 11418.24]  I don't think there's crouching, Dan.
[11418.26 --> 11418.84]  I think you're wrong.
[11419.00 --> 11419.44]  I'm not.
[11420.46 --> 11421.42]  Well, how do you crouch?
[11421.70 --> 11422.52]  Why would you crouch?
[11422.94 --> 11424.20]  Maybe they changed it.
[11424.20 --> 11426.70]  Because it hasn't been a single thing they've been to crouch for.
[11426.70 --> 11428.24]  Because it has dark mode now.
[11428.24 --> 11429.66]  You're gaslighting all of us.
[11429.90 --> 11430.92]  Gaslighting's not real.
[11433.50 --> 11435.28]  And if it was, it wasn't my fault.
[11436.04 --> 11437.38]  There was crouching.
[11437.70 --> 11438.40]  I'm not crouching.
[11440.68 --> 11442.00]  I swear it's down arrow.
[11442.10 --> 11442.88]  Did they remove that?
[11442.94 --> 11446.60]  Because it switches between light and dark, and there was definitely crouching.
[11446.74 --> 11450.92]  I don't remember it switching between light and dark mode, and I'm pretty sure I've played it for longer than that before.
[11451.06 --> 11452.70]  And it seems to do it on a pretty regular basis.
[11453.12 --> 11455.92]  Okay, this needs to actually just kill me at some point here.
[11455.92 --> 11456.32]  And I...
[11456.32 --> 11456.86]  You're too good.
[11457.20 --> 11457.48]  Never.
[11458.26 --> 11459.20]  There you go.
[11459.38 --> 11461.16]  I know that was crouching.
[11462.46 --> 11462.82]  Okay.
[11463.26 --> 11463.98]  Where are we?
[11464.18 --> 11464.78]  What are we doing?
[11465.20 --> 11467.98]  Well, if you beat that score, then you're a better gamer than Ludwig, I guess.
[11468.16 --> 11468.38]  Yep.
[11468.68 --> 11469.28]  100%.
[11469.28 --> 11470.62]  That's how it works, I think.
[11470.74 --> 11470.96]  Yep.
[11470.96 --> 11474.96]  If I beat Ludwig and you beat me, then you beat Ludwig by definition.
[11475.14 --> 11475.96]  Bigger fish, right?
[11476.06 --> 11476.56]  That's how it works.
[11477.20 --> 11477.64]  Hey, Luke.
[11478.02 --> 11481.96]  I'm a self-taught software engineer who started my professional career about a year ago.
[11482.06 --> 11482.32]  Nice.
[11482.32 --> 11487.58]  What are your thoughts on companies that crunch to meet deadlines, and how does Floatplane compare?
[11488.20 --> 11489.10]  I mean, we've done it.
[11490.10 --> 11491.74]  It's extremely uncommon.
[11492.08 --> 11493.00]  Like, extremely.
[11493.44 --> 11495.60]  I don't remember the last time we've done it.
[11495.60 --> 11503.54]  And when we do it, it's generally not me-driven, if that makes sense.
[11504.96 --> 11510.78]  I recognized a long time ago that I actually enjoy those activities, because I don't know,
[11510.84 --> 11512.02]  my brain's broken or something.
[11512.74 --> 11516.04]  But generally, that is significantly frowned upon.
[11516.04 --> 11526.52]  So, I have taken on a stance of, like, if other people are just doing it by default, I will generally, you know, join in and not stop them.
[11526.96 --> 11531.06]  But I try not to impose it, because I think that's bad.
[11531.20 --> 11538.86]  I think we're also fairly blessed to be in an industry where we mostly set our own deadlines for things.
[11540.02 --> 11545.60]  I think you run into some problems in things like the gaming industry when you're announcing the launch of a game.
[11546.04 --> 11551.50]  And then, say, you discover issues with the game ahead of the launch, and you're like, oh, my goodness.
[11551.80 --> 11554.02]  We need to fix all this stuff, or whatever.
[11554.60 --> 11557.98]  So, you announce the launch of a game, and then you do a playtest, and it's horrible.
[11558.16 --> 11560.00]  So, you're trying to improve it for whatever reason.
[11560.12 --> 11561.34]  Then you're crunching because of that.
[11561.44 --> 11569.66]  Like, there's a lot of industries where crunch is more real for more real reasons, if that makes sense.
[11569.86 --> 11572.86]  Maybe your piece of software has to match up with a piece of hardware.
[11572.86 --> 11577.32]  Yeah, you're a driver team for a GPU company.
[11577.46 --> 11579.38]  You need to be ready on time for the launch or whatever.
[11579.58 --> 11583.04]  Like, there's situations where it can maybe make sense.
[11583.46 --> 11586.98]  As annoying and frustrating as it is, it can maybe make sense.
[11587.16 --> 11589.80]  I don't think it often makes sense with floatplane.
[11589.80 --> 11593.68]  I can appeal to you guys, and I've done it.
[11594.46 --> 11600.60]  I'm saying we're going to work on something, and then we end up working on something else, or we make some change.
[11601.16 --> 11603.86]  And then I just, like, you know, apologize to you guys on Wancho.
[11604.38 --> 11608.14]  Explain why we made the change, what we're pivoting to, what you guys are going to get instead, etc.
[11608.34 --> 11610.18]  And then people are usually actually pretty cool with it.
[11610.26 --> 11612.72]  And I appreciate that, and that saves our developers from crunch.
[11612.72 --> 11615.18]  Not entirely.
[11615.58 --> 11615.84]  Yeah.
[11616.58 --> 11617.48]  It helps, though.
[11617.60 --> 11622.00]  Sometimes they crunch even when you tell them not to explicitly, which is actually frustrating.
[11622.20 --> 11624.36]  That can actually be a genuine, very large problem.
[11624.60 --> 11626.42]  Because people will burn out from that.
[11626.48 --> 11627.54]  And I'm like, well, hold on.
[11628.98 --> 11630.82]  I'm telling you not to keep working.
[11630.82 --> 11632.68]  This is not reverse psychology.
[11632.82 --> 11633.78]  Actually, don't do that.
[11633.78 --> 11635.96]  Yeah, like, don't work on the weekend.
[11636.12 --> 11636.96]  Take your weekend off.
[11637.04 --> 11638.96]  It's actually better for all of us.
[11639.28 --> 11641.06]  Like, just don't.
[11641.10 --> 11645.84]  My favorite line, we had an employee at one point that was very problematic that way.
[11645.94 --> 11649.84]  And my favorite line with them was always just like, you're no good to me dead.
[11650.10 --> 11650.30]  Yeah.
[11652.72 --> 11657.52]  Like, I don't know how to be more explicit than just don't.
[11658.04 --> 11658.30]  Yeah.
[11658.30 --> 11658.42]  Yeah.
[11659.06 --> 11659.50]  Yeah.
[11659.50 --> 11669.32]  It's frustrating because I think there's some, like, human spirit in the desire to, like, push really hard sometimes.
[11669.32 --> 11670.90]  And wanting to help the team and stuff like that.
[11670.96 --> 11671.54]  Like, I get it.
[11671.78 --> 11672.28]  I understand.
[11672.48 --> 11674.44]  It's driven by positive things.
[11674.56 --> 11675.36]  Yeah, but it can.
[11675.90 --> 11678.22]  But I need you to be here on Monday.
[11678.92 --> 11679.62]  And functional.
[11679.84 --> 11680.46]  And happy.
[11680.52 --> 11680.76]  Yeah.
[11681.44 --> 11682.08]  I don't want to.
[11682.22 --> 11683.58]  It's like, I don't want to.
[11683.58 --> 11684.22]  I don't.
[11684.42 --> 11688.64]  It's not constructive for anyone if you're, like, cranky and burnt out.
[11688.94 --> 11689.12]  Yeah.
[11689.92 --> 11693.54]  Or if you, like, miss things in your personal life because you're pushing for it.
[11693.64 --> 11695.74]  And then those people are complaining at you.
[11695.86 --> 11697.56]  And then, therefore, you're upset and all this kind of stuff.
[11697.58 --> 11698.64]  It's like, none of this was worth it.
[11698.64 --> 11700.24]  Inevitably, that resentment makes it back to work.
[11700.50 --> 11700.56]  Yeah.
[11700.56 --> 11702.92]  It's like, but I didn't ask you to do that.
[11703.34 --> 11703.76]  Yeah.
[11704.04 --> 11711.66]  So we're a little bit privileged to be in a situation where we're not running into situations too often where it's, like, super, super required.
[11711.96 --> 11712.18]  Yeah.
[11712.18 --> 11716.08]  Other industries are not as privileged.
[11716.22 --> 11720.52]  And I think sometimes those industries will recognize that they're in that state and then abuse it.
[11720.98 --> 11721.22]  Yeah.
[11721.32 --> 11724.30]  Because people getting into that industry will understand that that will happen.
[11724.44 --> 11728.32]  But they don't necessarily understand how much it will happen because the company leans on it intentionally.
[11728.32 --> 11729.50]  And that's really bad.
[11729.50 --> 11731.52]  But it's also not always true.
[11731.78 --> 11732.30]  I don't know.
[11732.46 --> 11732.96]  It's just.
[11734.08 --> 11734.38]  Okay.
[11734.58 --> 11735.08]  What's next?
[11735.08 --> 11736.08]  Hey, DLL.
[11736.40 --> 11739.46]  With MSI dropping AMD GPUs, sorry.
[11739.72 --> 11739.86]  Yeah.
[11739.96 --> 11745.26]  With MSI dropping AMD GPUs, is MSI trying to wound NVIDIA?
[11745.74 --> 11747.10]  The focus on AI.
[11747.58 --> 11753.76]  Will NVIDIA need a brand partner with no ties to AMD GPUs to handle products with lesser margins?
[11754.12 --> 11760.42]  If anything, NVIDIA tends to reward their most loyal servants with the products that have the higher margins.
[11760.42 --> 11766.88]  That higher margin has turned into more and more of a pittance over the years to the point where EVGA ultimately walked away from the business.
[11767.18 --> 11773.88]  But as for why MSI seems to be quietly dropping AMD GPUs, yeah, I'd say it's a strategic move.
[11774.20 --> 11777.26]  I mean, it's not like MSI is giving up their partnership with AMD overall.
[11777.38 --> 11780.70]  They're clearly still developing motherboards for AMD Ryzen platforms.
[11780.70 --> 11792.40]  But it's been very clear for some time that AMD is just not competitive on the GPU side of things.
[11792.54 --> 11796.38]  And it doesn't look like there's any obvious light at the end of that tunnel.
[11796.38 --> 11809.64]  So strategically, if I was MSI, seeing the longtime partnership with NVIDIA and kind of going, okay, if someone's going to blink and walk away from the Radeon partnership, why shouldn't it just be us?
[11809.72 --> 11821.52]  Like, why are we sabotaging the 85, 90% of the business that we're doing on our discrete cards with NVIDIA over this, like, handful of stupid Radeon GPUs?
[11821.52 --> 11826.34]  That realistically, some of them were probably spending more developing than were actually making back in the margins on these things.
[11826.38 --> 11828.70]  It's not like there's a ton of money in selling Radeon cards either.
[11831.04 --> 11836.10]  I think if that was XFX, I'd be kicking myself pretty hard at this point because they'd be the last game in town.
[11836.22 --> 11839.04]  They were exclusive NVIDIA until they went exclusive AMD.
[11841.52 --> 11841.92]  Yep.
[11842.02 --> 11846.18]  You talked about the LTT wallet about a year ago on WAN Show.
[11846.34 --> 11847.66]  Any updates still in development?
[11848.14 --> 11848.28]  Dead.
[11848.28 --> 11854.50]  Hey, DLL, what is Lab's policy on AI scraping?
[11855.00 --> 11858.54]  If it's not allowed, have you heard about tools like Nightshade?
[11858.74 --> 11861.66]  Or have you considered an AI chatbot of your own?
[11862.12 --> 11863.98]  Good old can't beat him, join him.
[11864.92 --> 11867.28]  I'm not familiar with Nightshade specifically.
[11867.62 --> 11868.14]  We talked about it, WAN.
[11868.34 --> 11868.78]  Oh, did we?
[11869.24 --> 11870.48]  I forget which one that is.
[11870.56 --> 11872.10]  We're not doing a lot of that stuff yet.
[11872.40 --> 11875.62]  It's very possible we will do, like, poisoning tools at some point.
[11875.62 --> 11875.66]  Right.
[11875.98 --> 11881.16]  There's also some groups that are trying to develop, like, you know, like a robots.txt.
[11881.44 --> 11882.52]  Oh, that Nightshade.
[11882.72 --> 11883.16]  Yeah, okay.
[11884.04 --> 11891.22]  There's groups that are trying to come up with, like, an effective equivalent for scrapers that tells them that it's not wanted.
[11891.22 --> 11893.98]  So if that happens, we'll probably do that.
[11894.06 --> 11894.66]  I don't know.
[11894.98 --> 11899.38]  It's a problem that we need to solve eventually.
[11900.16 --> 11910.78]  But right now we're more focused on getting our processes down, getting our article publication schedule down, and making sure the quality is really tight.
[11910.78 --> 11914.36]  We have our first keyboard article up on the site right now.
[11914.40 --> 11915.72]  Just going to show, yeah.
[11915.84 --> 11915.98]  Yeah.
[11916.30 --> 11916.58]  Yeah.
[11917.02 --> 11919.78]  So we have the Apex 3 up, including...
[11920.30 --> 11924.32]  Force graphs for different keys.
[11924.60 --> 11926.42]  You can select any key you want.
[11926.90 --> 11928.70]  How cool is that?
[11930.16 --> 11931.28]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[11932.30 --> 11933.54]  It's my screen right now.
[11933.62 --> 11934.02]  Pretty neat.
[11934.16 --> 11934.32]  Oh.
[11934.82 --> 11935.04]  Here.
[11935.20 --> 11935.44]  Dang it.
[11935.50 --> 11937.74]  Oh, we both clicked ours at exactly the same time.
[11937.74 --> 11938.76]  I was doing a whole thing.
[11938.76 --> 11940.48]  I realized you were talking.
[11940.66 --> 11940.88]  Yeah.
[11940.94 --> 11944.56]  So you can select different keys, and you can see the force that we measured on those different keys.
[11944.62 --> 11948.02]  Because remember, the key cap itself has a different weight to it.
[11948.04 --> 11954.48]  So even if you use exactly the same key switch, you won't necessarily have exactly onto exactly the same experience.
[11954.60 --> 11957.38]  We've got some cute little videos here.
[11957.54 --> 11958.68]  Why is this not on float plane?
[11958.76 --> 11959.02]  I don't know.
[11959.08 --> 11959.80]  We'll figure it out later.
[11960.22 --> 11961.54]  Showing latency testing.
[11962.40 --> 11964.98]  We've got our average wired latency.
[11965.54 --> 11965.80]  Yeah.
[11965.84 --> 11966.64]  Good stuff, right?
[11967.22 --> 11968.44]  It's going to take time.
[11968.44 --> 11971.72]  Just to be clear to the dev team, that is the correct way to do it right now.
[11971.78 --> 11972.32]  Don't worry about it.
[11972.90 --> 11973.30]  Yes.
[11973.42 --> 11977.46]  Do not crunch yourself into a freely accessible float plane player.
[11977.76 --> 11983.26]  The architecture of float plane is not designed for free video distribution.
[11983.46 --> 11985.04]  It's designed to be authenticated.
[11985.62 --> 11995.30]  So we would have to actually do a significant amount of work, is my understanding, in order to make a free player that we can use our float plane CMS to upload to.
[11996.14 --> 11996.96]  That would be kind of annoying.
[11996.96 --> 11998.00]  We'll see.
[11998.64 --> 12001.74]  And if you, there's just so many other things we can work on.
[12001.78 --> 12003.00]  And YouTube is just so free.
[12003.16 --> 12004.08]  It's right there.
[12004.24 --> 12005.58]  It's right there and it's free.
[12005.78 --> 12005.98]  Yeah.
[12006.24 --> 12006.76]  I get it.
[12006.82 --> 12007.32]  I get it.
[12007.32 --> 12008.64]  Yeah.
[12008.64 --> 12011.26]  Hi, LLD.
[12011.26 --> 12012.46]  Linus and Lou.
[12012.46 --> 12012.52]  Linus and Lou.
[12012.52 --> 12018.82]  What was one of your most impactful celebrity or person of clout encounters that you've had?
[12018.96 --> 12019.68]  Who was it?
[12019.92 --> 12023.06]  And how did meeting this person either changed?
[12023.16 --> 12023.84]  And then it's cut off.
[12024.10 --> 12024.94]  It's changed you.
[12026.22 --> 12028.38]  Changed your outlook on life.
[12028.38 --> 12032.38]  It definitely didn't really change my outlook on life, but I like this story.
[12033.06 --> 12039.58]  Do you remember when you had that talk with Markiplier like a billion years ago and you talked about like hosting and stuff?
[12040.54 --> 12043.30]  This would have been like seven years ago or something.
[12043.56 --> 12046.04]  I did not know that I met Markiplier.
[12046.04 --> 12047.86]  I don't think, I don't know if you met him or not.
[12047.94 --> 12048.82]  I know you talked to him.
[12049.44 --> 12049.76]  Really?
[12050.04 --> 12050.30]  Yeah.
[12050.44 --> 12050.66]  Cool.
[12051.06 --> 12054.20]  You talked to him about hosting and you talked to him about my hosting.
[12055.42 --> 12055.98]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[12056.12 --> 12057.82]  So I knew he knew who we were.
[12058.04 --> 12059.56]  Anyways, that's the only part of the context.
[12059.68 --> 12059.82]  Wow.
[12059.86 --> 12060.92]  I totally forgot about that.
[12060.98 --> 12061.08]  Yeah.
[12061.08 --> 12061.78]  He's kind of a big deal.
[12062.60 --> 12069.08]  My friends and I were going to PAX Prime and we stopped in at Starbucks because a bunch of my friends want coffee.
[12069.14 --> 12070.02]  I don't drink coffee, whatever.
[12070.02 --> 12074.88]  But I noticed that he's standing there off on the side and no one's noticed him yet.
[12074.88 --> 12078.94]  The reason why I know no one's noticed him yet is because the entire restaurant wasn't hoarding him.
[12079.02 --> 12079.20]  Right.
[12079.26 --> 12080.60]  Because he's kind of a big deal.
[12081.00 --> 12081.78]  Yeah, a little bit.
[12082.00 --> 12087.88]  And I saw him standing over there and he was like mostly kind of keeping his head down and I think with intention because it's pretty early in the morning.
[12087.94 --> 12089.24]  You just want some freaking coffee.
[12089.42 --> 12090.14]  Yeah, I don't blame him.
[12090.62 --> 12097.50]  And I saw him and we kind of locked eyes and I just head nodded and he head nodded and we went back to ignoring each other and I was like, cool.
[12098.90 --> 12099.72]  That's pretty awesome.
[12100.06 --> 12103.60]  Yeah, I was like, I'm happy that this didn't turn into like a thing.
[12103.60 --> 12108.32]  I'm happy I was able to not bother him in that moment.
[12108.58 --> 12110.16]  And it was just like, I don't know.
[12110.24 --> 12111.18]  It was pretty cool.
[12112.82 --> 12113.98]  Yeah, that's about it.
[12114.42 --> 12122.38]  I don't think like, I don't think I've been hugely impacted by a meeting a celebrity of any kind.
[12122.38 --> 12129.76]  I'm trying to remember.
[12130.06 --> 12131.60]  I'm trying to remember what his name is.
[12134.44 --> 12136.08]  Man, the Starbomb guy.
[12136.80 --> 12137.76]  Someone help me out here.
[12138.14 --> 12138.78]  Starbomb guy.
[12139.10 --> 12139.38]  Yeah.
[12139.84 --> 12140.20]  Egoraptor.
[12140.26 --> 12140.68]  That's right.
[12140.88 --> 12141.22]  Oh, yeah.
[12141.26 --> 12141.38]  Yeah.
[12141.38 --> 12147.86]  I've told this story before, but I met him at an event and I didn't realize who he was.
[12147.92 --> 12155.64]  He like was talking to me about maybe we could like use his like live production company services at some point if we ever wanted to do like a tour or something.
[12155.64 --> 12159.32]  I was like networking and stuff and he seemed cool and everything.
[12159.32 --> 12167.66]  But I didn't realize who he was until I like looked up his name in the elevator and I had to like go find him later in the event.
[12167.74 --> 12170.44]  I was like, yo, I had no fucking idea who you were.
[12170.52 --> 12172.80]  I like grew up watching your cartoons and stuff.
[12174.64 --> 12175.32]  Mad respect.
[12175.56 --> 12175.90]  See you later.
[12177.26 --> 12178.06]  That's pretty cool.
[12178.46 --> 12179.36]  That's actually pretty cool.
[12181.22 --> 12181.58]  Yeah.
[12181.84 --> 12182.66]  I mean, that's the thing, right?
[12182.68 --> 12183.74]  About animators, right?
[12183.88 --> 12185.56]  Like it's and he does so many different voices.
[12185.56 --> 12189.34]  It's not like you would just know from his voice unless you unless you know.
[12190.10 --> 12192.48]  So you like are a Game Grumps watcher or something.
[12192.62 --> 12193.54]  Yeah, which I wasn't.
[12193.64 --> 12193.82]  Yeah.
[12194.58 --> 12197.80]  Because I believe he did the animated stuff for a long time before he started showing up.
[12197.86 --> 12199.64]  Yeah, like I watched his stuff on like Newgrounds.
[12199.64 --> 12200.42]  Yeah, exactly.
[12203.42 --> 12204.66]  First merch message.
[12205.00 --> 12206.16]  Glad to be here.
[12206.54 --> 12207.22]  Simple question.
[12207.74 --> 12209.50]  When car focused channel.
[12209.50 --> 12215.38]  I love tech and I love cars and I want to make me a tech and car YouTube channel.
[12215.38 --> 12219.80]  Then watch every car video that we upload to the other channels.
[12220.12 --> 12226.56]  And the more we can make the pitch for financial viability, the more we will be able to make
[12226.56 --> 12229.46]  that dedicated channel or channels in the future.
[12229.88 --> 12231.86]  It's a super crowded space, though, guys.
[12231.86 --> 12235.84]  It's not like we can just walk in and immediately have a reason for being.
[12235.84 --> 12244.78]  I definitely have a lot of thoughts, but, you know, reviewing products is a ton of work.
[12245.00 --> 12250.34]  And I think right now our main focus is on just making sure that our that our tech videos are solid.
[12252.84 --> 12254.32]  Cars will come when they come.
[12254.32 --> 12256.86]  Hi, Luke.
[12257.06 --> 12264.56]  I am studying data analytics and in the process of building a website that utilized a database to budget my money and save receipts.
[12265.20 --> 12269.08]  How did you decide what to use for Flowplane and then designing it?
[12270.36 --> 12271.42]  Linus-led development.
[12271.56 --> 12272.04]  Let's go.
[12272.72 --> 12274.96]  I want an Excel database, Luke.
[12275.62 --> 12277.66]  How do you decide what to use for Flowplane?
[12277.76 --> 12278.16]  No, no, no.
[12278.24 --> 12279.50]  None of that was Linus-led development.
[12279.68 --> 12280.70]  He had no idea at all.
[12284.08 --> 12285.52]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[12285.56 --> 12287.78]  We wouldn't use Cloudflare today if it wasn't for me.
[12288.68 --> 12290.48]  I forced him to call them.
[12291.28 --> 12292.76]  I think we would be using them today.
[12292.84 --> 12293.06]  Okay.
[12293.38 --> 12296.08]  Today we probably would, but it would have taken a lot longer.
[12296.16 --> 12297.16]  It would have taken a while longer.
[12297.16 --> 12299.36]  He was so stubbornly determined.
[12299.78 --> 12304.72]  He was determined that they were not going to work for DDoS protection for our site.
[12305.34 --> 12306.44]  I mean, stuff still got through.
[12306.44 --> 12308.70]  I was still a little bit right, but I wasn't right enough.
[12308.84 --> 12310.50]  You were not nearly right enough.
[12312.28 --> 12314.32]  Why are you making a website for this?
[12315.12 --> 12317.88]  In the process of building a website that utilized...
[12317.88 --> 12319.18]  Nothing is allowed to be for fun.
[12319.96 --> 12323.72]  I'm in the process of building a website that utilized...
[12323.72 --> 12326.96]  I hope you don't actually hold that conviction.
[12327.22 --> 12328.74]  We're not allowed to talk anymore.
[12328.92 --> 12329.74]  No, no, no, no.
[12329.96 --> 12331.46]  If it's just for fun, that's cool.
[12331.56 --> 12334.28]  If you want something, I would honestly really suggest...
[12334.28 --> 12335.96]  That's why we monetize our hanging out.
[12336.44 --> 12337.60]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12338.10 --> 12340.94]  All my hobbies are monetized as well.
[12341.02 --> 12341.90]  I'm no better.
[12342.06 --> 12343.30]  Yeah, so what are you talking about?
[12344.74 --> 12350.94]  I think you'd be better off just doing fancy Google Sheets and learning how to do fancy things with Google Sheets.
[12350.94 --> 12356.34]  Because I think a lot of people don't realize at all how powerful it is with its ability to link to other sheets and things.
[12357.40 --> 12361.30]  There's also Looker Studio now, which they renamed Big Data Studio.
[12362.74 --> 12364.08]  It's now Big Data Studio?
[12364.12 --> 12364.78]  No, it used to be.
[12364.86 --> 12366.60]  Now it's Looker Studio, which is the Google.
[12367.28 --> 12369.40]  It's a different thing than they killed the other one.
[12369.52 --> 12370.62]  No, it's just a dumb name.
[12370.62 --> 12371.36]  It is a dumb name.
[12372.02 --> 12374.10]  Looker Studio is so stupid.
[12374.10 --> 12376.52]  And that can have Google Sheet databases?
[12377.18 --> 12379.80]  Yeah, Excel is better, except Excel isn't remotely accessible.
[12380.06 --> 12381.88]  Okay, guy...
[12381.88 --> 12382.92]  What about Office 365?
[12383.20 --> 12383.46]  Got him.
[12383.58 --> 12384.60]  Ah, it's bad.
[12384.68 --> 12385.62]  The web version is bad.
[12385.62 --> 12388.58]  All right.
[12391.66 --> 12393.00]  Okay, so the decisions...
[12393.00 --> 12394.00]  Let me get to the root of this.
[12394.06 --> 12396.98]  How do you decide what to use for floatplane and then designing it?
[12398.10 --> 12398.38]  We...
[12398.38 --> 12404.50]  I mean, I tried to make some decisions with Jake, and we wrote down our pretty bad decisions.
[12404.78 --> 12407.44]  And then AJ was like, hold on.
[12407.94 --> 12408.20]  Yeah.
[12408.50 --> 12411.92]  And then we went with what AJ said for the most part, and then I...
[12411.92 --> 12413.44]  Fun fact, he still works for floatplane.
[12413.54 --> 12413.94]  Yeah, it's great.
[12413.94 --> 12414.36]  That AJ.
[12414.36 --> 12418.92]  I had the team at the time religiously read the Netflix blog.
[12419.90 --> 12424.00]  I would post it in our Slack every time they post it in your article.
[12424.18 --> 12425.74]  I like how you refer to it as the team.
[12426.38 --> 12426.58]  Yeah.
[12426.68 --> 12427.52]  It's like you and AJ.
[12427.70 --> 12428.42]  And some volunteers.
[12428.76 --> 12428.94]  Yeah.
[12429.18 --> 12429.62]  Heck yeah.
[12429.82 --> 12430.80]  There was volunteers back then.
[12430.82 --> 12431.24]  That's true.
[12431.40 --> 12431.86]  More people.
[12433.12 --> 12436.54]  But yeah, we would read the Netflix blog, and we got a lot of our early...
[12436.54 --> 12441.86]  Because my info on it was like a lot of these websites are not sharing information on how
[12441.86 --> 12442.88]  they're making their video websites.
[12442.88 --> 12444.90]  It was very closed back then.
[12445.18 --> 12446.06]  Very, very closed.
[12446.28 --> 12451.60]  And then there's Netflix just being like, hey, here's how we do basically everything.
[12451.72 --> 12455.56]  And I was like, okay, well, this isn't exactly what we're trying to build, but it's pretty
[12455.56 --> 12456.00]  close.
[12456.00 --> 12460.64]  So let's take some ideas from these people that are clearly doing a great job of this
[12460.64 --> 12463.50]  and try to mirror a lot of what they're doing.
[12463.72 --> 12465.24]  And it worked quite well for us for a while.
[12465.46 --> 12468.22]  And now we've kind of pivoted onto our own things now that we have a lot of experience
[12468.22 --> 12468.74]  in the space.
[12468.74 --> 12474.66]  But yeah, we learned from another player in the space that has been doing really well.
[12474.86 --> 12476.82]  If you're doing it for fun, do that.
[12477.00 --> 12480.08]  If you're not doing it for fun, seriously consider something like Google Sheets instead
[12480.08 --> 12481.08]  of making a website for this.
[12484.36 --> 12484.76]  Yeah.
[12485.66 --> 12486.06]  Okay.
[12486.14 --> 12487.26]  Here's a good one.
[12487.26 --> 12502.54]  I mean, it's easier for you guys to answer this one.
[12502.60 --> 12505.56]  Have you noticed anything positive or are things just generally worse?
[12509.88 --> 12511.82]  We feel more like a real company.
[12512.70 --> 12514.12]  You can take that however you want.
[12514.12 --> 12518.06]  Oh, I'll take it.
[12518.40 --> 12519.28]  Oh my.
[12519.48 --> 12520.16]  Oh my.
[12521.92 --> 12524.76]  I think, what are some of the challenges?
[12525.34 --> 12529.96]  I don't think there's been a ton of challenges, particularly pertaining to that, to be clear.
[12531.86 --> 12541.64]  I think Taryn has a, I don't know what, it's like a completely different food, but it tastes
[12541.64 --> 12542.04]  the same.
[12542.04 --> 12548.94]  So it's cereal, but it isn't?
[12549.18 --> 12552.88]  But it like, you eat like a cereal flavored candy bar and you're like, wait.
[12553.00 --> 12554.06]  So it's a cereal bar.
[12554.48 --> 12554.74]  Yeah.
[12558.82 --> 12559.54]  I don't know.
[12559.60 --> 12562.68]  It's like, it's, it's very similar, but it's not the same.
[12562.80 --> 12569.00]  Like Taryn has a different approach to things and a different style, but they're clearly
[12569.00 --> 12569.80]  highly related.
[12569.80 --> 12571.74]  Overall, the guiding star is the same.
[12571.86 --> 12575.56]  I mean, it's not like I would have brought in someone who's just going to completely mess
[12575.56 --> 12576.12]  up my baby.
[12576.30 --> 12580.24]  I don't think there's a lot of like new challenges because of that, if that makes sense.
[12580.88 --> 12583.60]  I mean, we're definitely, we're definitely doing some stuff differently.
[12583.60 --> 12588.68]  Like our entire leadership team, which is about almost a fifth or a quarter of a company,
[12588.82 --> 12593.62]  somewhere in there, is doing like executive leadership training right now.
[12593.62 --> 12595.50]  I think that's a positive development.
[12595.62 --> 12596.98]  Oh, you were trying to think of a challenge.
[12597.12 --> 12597.24]  Yeah.
[12600.08 --> 12602.68]  I mean, he's remote still like half the time.
[12602.86 --> 12606.46]  I consider that a challenge, but I guess for most people, it probably doesn't make much
[12606.46 --> 12606.98]  of a difference.
[12607.10 --> 12609.20]  No, because you were too spread thin anyways.
[12609.28 --> 12610.24]  So you weren't there anyways.
[12610.42 --> 12611.18]  Yeah, that's fair.
[12611.44 --> 12611.84]  So like.
[12612.24 --> 12612.38]  Yeah.
[12612.38 --> 12613.10]  What difference does it make?
[12613.22 --> 12613.46]  All right.
[12613.58 --> 12614.00]  Fair enough.
[12614.00 --> 12620.00]  If anything, there's probably more time being spent because when he is here, half the time
[12620.00 --> 12622.20]  that he's here, that's more time.
[12622.94 --> 12624.18]  So I don't know.
[12624.82 --> 12628.48]  Someone asked for more French Terry hoodies and someone else sniped me on the reply.
[12628.72 --> 12629.24]  I said K.
[12630.88 --> 12632.80]  Sorry, I think I just showed that one.
[12633.94 --> 12634.38]  Okay.
[12634.44 --> 12635.80]  Last one I've got for you here.
[12636.52 --> 12640.52]  Linus, I just purchased an S2 Del Mar for my daily commute.
[12640.86 --> 12641.76]  I have no idea what that is.
[12641.76 --> 12643.86]  I will go look it up while you continue to read.
[12644.80 --> 12648.84]  What is your favorite bike gear, accessories, safety equipment, or tech?
[12649.22 --> 12651.32]  Likely we'll order a brake free.
[12651.98 --> 12652.72]  It looks cool.
[12652.92 --> 12653.82]  I mean, yeah, it looks sick.
[12655.06 --> 12656.56]  The S2 Del Mar.
[12657.76 --> 12659.16]  I don't know.
[12659.24 --> 12659.72]  It doesn't really.
[12660.06 --> 12660.44]  Oh, yeah.
[12660.44 --> 12661.32]  It kind of looks like it.
[12662.40 --> 12663.36]  Yeah, I think it's electric.
[12664.28 --> 12665.86]  Far ranging, fast charging.
[12665.98 --> 12666.38]  Absolutely.
[12666.60 --> 12667.38]  That makes me think electric.
[12667.50 --> 12672.24]  City range, 181 kilometers to charge in 78 minutes.
[12672.24 --> 12672.86]  That's pretty nice.
[12672.96 --> 12673.22]  Whew.
[12673.22 --> 12673.70]  Whew.
[12673.82 --> 12674.24]  Whew.
[12674.62 --> 12675.42]  She goes.
[12676.06 --> 12676.50]  Dang.
[12676.76 --> 12677.20]  Dang.
[12677.54 --> 12677.88]  Dang.
[12678.06 --> 12678.82]  Yeah, she goes.
[12679.50 --> 12679.86]  Zoom.
[12680.54 --> 12682.22]  Stunts performed by professionals.
[12682.38 --> 12683.06]  Good Lord.
[12683.18 --> 12683.96]  Vooosh, vooosh.
[12684.28 --> 12685.06]  Oh, okay.
[12686.52 --> 12687.50]  I'm doing the audio.
[12688.48 --> 12688.88]  Hi.
[12688.88 --> 12693.00]  Anywho.
[12693.00 --> 12694.28]  Yeah, that looks super cool.
[12694.38 --> 12695.12]  I got to confess.
[12695.36 --> 12700.28]  I test drove an electric bike a while back and it just didn't sing to me.
[12700.48 --> 12703.88]  So I ended up dumping a bunch of money into my SV650S.
[12704.12 --> 12710.08]  It's an old 2003, but I'm really looking forward to having it back on the road.
[12710.08 --> 12714.24]  As for my favorite gear, honestly, I just have like kind of pedestrian stuff.
[12714.34 --> 12720.84]  I don't really, I just, I just like riding my bike.
[12720.84 --> 12722.40]  You have a lot of the same stuff too.
[12722.90 --> 12726.36]  Yeah, I haven't, I haven't, I don't replace things unless I absolutely have to.
[12726.58 --> 12729.48]  Like I buy a new helmet every, you know, five or six years like you're supposed to.
[12729.62 --> 12729.82]  Yeah.
[12730.16 --> 12732.52]  I'm going to, I'm going to paint my new one to match my bike.
[12732.82 --> 12733.06]  Yeah.
[12733.18 --> 12733.54]  I don't know.
[12733.54 --> 12734.50]  It's probably all the same stuff, right?
[12734.52 --> 12734.86]  I'm assuming.
[12735.00 --> 12736.36]  It's something from someone.
[12736.46 --> 12736.66]  Yeah.
[12736.72 --> 12737.68]  Has some armor in it.
[12738.34 --> 12741.10]  I got the one that fits.
[12742.32 --> 12742.84]  You know?
[12745.70 --> 12746.02]  Nice.
[12746.18 --> 12746.76]  I don't know, man.
[12746.78 --> 12752.02]  I'm just, I'm not much of a, it's funny because I'll say stuff like I'm, you know,
[12752.02 --> 12754.74]  I'm not that much into the aesthetics of things.
[12754.82 --> 12756.50]  I just, I don't care about the brand.
[12756.54 --> 12757.52]  I'm just buying functionality.
[12757.52 --> 12758.84]  Like I say stuff like that.
[12758.84 --> 12763.78]  And then I am spending, I kid you not, like thousands of dollars painting my bike.
[12764.40 --> 12766.84]  But that's not about, it's not about the end result.
[12766.96 --> 12770.76]  Like if I was buying a bike on Craigslist, I would just get whatever one.
[12770.82 --> 12772.20]  I don't care what color it is.
[12772.26 --> 12772.38]  Yeah.
[12772.46 --> 12774.62]  It's more about the project of doing it.
[12776.20 --> 12778.26]  So I don't, I don't know how to address this.
[12779.08 --> 12784.30]  I have some wired headphones that I, that I installed into my helmet.
[12784.64 --> 12785.10]  Nice.
[12785.10 --> 12789.48]  And then I run them like down to a, to a thing so that, so they don't go in my ear so I can
[12789.48 --> 12790.38]  hear everything around me.
[12790.40 --> 12791.42]  But I got like speakers.
[12791.70 --> 12791.98]  Nice.
[12792.08 --> 12795.92]  Like they're, they're like the, the, the, the drivers out of a pair of headphones and
[12795.92 --> 12799.18]  they just kind of like sit in the little ear things inside my helmet.
[12801.10 --> 12805.26]  Like you're probably expecting me to talk about like my sick, you know, heads up display
[12805.26 --> 12806.04]  helmet or whatever.
[12806.20 --> 12807.94]  Nah, man, I just wear whatever fits.
[12810.28 --> 12810.68]  Sorry.
[12810.82 --> 12811.68]  I'm, I'm so.
[12812.78 --> 12813.44]  Oh man.
[12813.66 --> 12813.86]  Yeah.
[12813.90 --> 12814.76]  I'm basic.
[12815.18 --> 12816.90]  Can you get like a, I'm basic HUD?
[12817.78 --> 12818.18]  Probably.
[12818.92 --> 12819.24]  Yeah.
[12819.26 --> 12823.42]  I think there's some pretty cool helmets, but like man, you gotta replace that.
[12823.64 --> 12824.56]  Like every few years.
[12824.70 --> 12825.90]  Buy a visor that has it.
[12825.94 --> 12826.94]  You have to buy the whole helmet.
[12827.00 --> 12827.28]  I don't know.
[12827.32 --> 12827.58]  Maybe.
[12827.88 --> 12828.08]  Oh.
[12828.60 --> 12830.56]  But like helmets are already expensive.
[12830.56 --> 12831.08]  But I have one that fits.
[12831.08 --> 12832.68]  Like, yeah, mine's good.
[12832.88 --> 12833.38]  It's good.
[12833.38 --> 12835.76]  Like, and to be clear, I'm not buying low quality stuff.
[12835.84 --> 12838.96]  Like I have a showy helmet, which is not a word to describe it.
[12839.02 --> 12839.50]  It's a brand.
[12839.74 --> 12839.78]  Yeah.
[12840.44 --> 12843.80]  Um, man, I don't know.
[12843.96 --> 12845.56]  Apparently none of the HUD helmets are good yet.
[12845.64 --> 12846.68]  Like that's the thing, right?
[12846.72 --> 12850.50]  Is I, I tend to, I tend to wait for other people to buy garbage and then I'll buy like
[12850.50 --> 12851.94]  a good one when it doesn't suck.
[12852.20 --> 12852.40]  Yeah.
[12853.34 --> 12853.70]  Fair enough.
[12854.08 --> 12854.54]  All right.
[12854.62 --> 12855.62]  I think that's it.
[12856.88 --> 12858.64]  Do we have any machinists on staff?
[12858.64 --> 12862.12]  We definitely have some part-time, uh, machinists.
[12862.12 --> 12864.24]  I think ours is total four axis.
[12864.48 --> 12865.34]  Dan, would you know?
[12865.78 --> 12867.54]  Uh, machinists or our machine?
[12867.66 --> 12867.96]  What do you mean?
[12868.12 --> 12868.28]  Yeah.
[12868.36 --> 12869.32]  Our, our Tormach.
[12869.38 --> 12870.46]  How many axes does it take?
[12870.46 --> 12871.44]  Uh, yeah, we have an A axis.
[12871.56 --> 12872.22]  So it's four axis.
[12873.38 --> 12875.68]  So you said eight and then you said four?
[12875.76 --> 12876.56]  A axis.
[12876.82 --> 12877.02]  Yeah.
[12877.06 --> 12878.12]  That's the roll one, right?
[12878.16 --> 12878.38]  Yes.
[12878.52 --> 12879.50]  That would be the fourth axis.
[12879.62 --> 12879.74]  Yeah.
[12879.80 --> 12880.02]  Okay.
[12880.06 --> 12880.24]  Okay.
[12880.24 --> 12880.46]  Okay.
[12880.46 --> 12882.16]  Uh, so that's what we have.
[12882.20 --> 12885.88]  And we definitely have some folks that are more than capable of using it like Sebastian
[12885.88 --> 12886.52]  and Tynan.
[12886.74 --> 12889.04]  I got to learn how to do conversational on it.
[12889.08 --> 12889.82]  It was terrifying.
[12889.94 --> 12891.92]  But they are not full-time machinists.
[12892.02 --> 12897.28]  You will see some really cool, um, you'll, you will see some really cool discussion from
[12897.28 --> 12898.68]  them about how it works though.
[12898.72 --> 12902.22]  In an upcoming video where we made a giant version of the screwdriver in-house.
[12905.08 --> 12906.28]  That's kind of cool actually.
[12906.46 --> 12906.66]  Yeah.
[12906.76 --> 12908.96]  It feels like something you'd see at like science world.
[12909.00 --> 12909.80]  It'll be for a stream.
[12910.32 --> 12911.72]  So I have to build a computer with it.
[12911.72 --> 12915.16]  Apparently I have only gotten to see a picture of it so far.
[12915.26 --> 12916.02]  I'm pretty excited.
[12916.14 --> 12917.84]  It looks hilarious.
[12918.34 --> 12920.18]  Like it's thicker around than this.
[12920.62 --> 12920.98]  Nice.
[12921.02 --> 12921.64]  For the handle.
[12921.84 --> 12922.38]  I'll get it done.
[12922.56 --> 12922.76]  Yeah.
[12923.00 --> 12923.22]  Yeah.
[12923.22 --> 12928.10]  Like it's like the guy that she tells you not to worry about version of the screwdriver.
[12928.34 --> 12929.58]  Not a bad screwdriver.
[12929.86 --> 12930.10]  Yeah.
[12931.54 --> 12932.22]  All right.
[12932.88 --> 12935.44]  Uh, someone asks if there will be super checks after party.
[12935.88 --> 12939.78]  Honestly, I played super checks at lounge night with someone the other night.
[12939.80 --> 12941.60]  I can't say I got to go do medicine for the birds.
[12941.68 --> 12942.44]  Oh, I mean, that's fine.
[12942.50 --> 12945.32]  I was going to say, um, losing it a little bit.
[12945.88 --> 12946.28]  No.
[12946.52 --> 12946.78]  Dang.
[12946.86 --> 12947.66]  No, it was boring.
[12948.04 --> 12953.20]  Oh, it's not actually like fun to play against people right now.
[12953.92 --> 12955.78]  Um, and you're still fun.
[12956.08 --> 12956.40]  Good.
[12956.60 --> 12956.96]  But.
[12957.16 --> 12958.50]  Hey, last time was pretty close.
[12958.62 --> 12960.22]  You definitely beat me, but it was pretty close.
[12960.24 --> 12960.52]  Yeah.
[12961.36 --> 12964.04]  But like, I'm, I'm kind of tired of winning every time.
[12964.06 --> 12966.00]  You should have not done the tape review.
[12966.56 --> 12967.44]  Yeah, maybe not.
[12967.60 --> 12968.86]  But I want, I want it to be good.
[12969.00 --> 12969.94]  You were good.
[12972.32 --> 12973.74]  I wanted to get good though.
[12973.90 --> 12975.84]  Hey, we never talked about the rabbit R1.
[12976.24 --> 12978.62]  We kind of missed, we kind of missed a pretty.
[12978.62 --> 12980.42]  Yeah, it kind of sucks and we should have had a launch for you on it.
[12980.80 --> 12982.78]  Uh, I don't think we had it yet.
[12983.22 --> 12983.90]  Oh yeah.
[12984.16 --> 12984.94]  We got it though.
[12985.02 --> 12985.90]  I did a short circuit.
[12986.34 --> 12987.46]  Well, it kind of sucks.
[12987.70 --> 12991.92]  No, no, we don't have to do the whole topic, but I will say watch the short circuit video
[12991.92 --> 12998.26]  because no matter how bad you think the R1 is, um, it managed to be worse than the short
[12998.26 --> 12998.92]  circuit video.
[12998.92 --> 12999.30]  Oh boy.
[12999.62 --> 13002.66]  I, I, I love teenage engineering stuff.
[13002.74 --> 13005.60]  I don't think I'll ever buy anything they ever make because it's all way too expensive,
[13005.60 --> 13007.54]  but I really liked their design work.
[13007.54 --> 13009.56]  And it seems to be of dubious utility.
[13010.36 --> 13010.76]  Yeah.
[13010.90 --> 13015.38]  Generally speaking, I don't really understand what that company does or why it exists.
[13015.54 --> 13017.28]  Some of their stuff just looks really cool though.
[13017.84 --> 13019.20]  I wish more things looked like that.
[13019.20 --> 13020.92]  But I don't buy stuff for looking cool.
[13021.04 --> 13021.28]  Exactly.
[13021.36 --> 13021.92]  I don't get it.
[13021.92 --> 13024.06]  Which is why I'll never buy any of it, but it looks sweet.
[13024.54 --> 13025.32]  Um, yeah.
[13025.36 --> 13030.42]  People have this like weird relationship with teenage engineering that I, that is true.
[13030.52 --> 13031.26]  I don't have that.
[13031.26 --> 13032.38]  I don't understand.
[13032.38 --> 13034.06]  Like they just, they're like fans of them.
[13034.12 --> 13038.02]  They'll just buy stuff just because they worked on the design.
[13038.02 --> 13044.00]  But like, I kid you not, it has a giant touchscreen covering half of the front of the unit and you
[13044.00 --> 13045.08]  can't interact with it.
[13045.12 --> 13046.36]  You have to use the wheel.
[13046.54 --> 13048.46]  This just looks so cool.
[13048.78 --> 13049.18]  Sure.
[13049.34 --> 13050.66]  But so what?
[13051.06 --> 13052.36]  I'm never going to buy it.
[13052.48 --> 13052.72]  Yeah.
[13052.84 --> 13057.36]  Not only would I never use it, but I would have no, like, I can't, I literally, even if
[13057.36 --> 13060.68]  I was in this interest industry, I don't think I would buy this.
[13060.68 --> 13062.58]  Yeah, but it's a, it's a, it's like an instrument.
[13062.70 --> 13064.04]  How else will you dial the telephone?
[13064.32 --> 13064.64]  Awesome.
[13064.76 --> 13065.60]  It looks so cool.
[13066.14 --> 13068.24]  That makes some neat instruments, but I'll never buy it.
[13068.54 --> 13068.92]  Anyways.
[13069.24 --> 13071.80]  Um, so yeah, I think, I think the design looks cool and stuff.
[13071.90 --> 13077.56]  And I, I don't hate the idea of making dedicated devices for things that you would normally
[13077.56 --> 13078.48]  use your phone for.
[13078.56 --> 13078.92]  Yeah.
[13079.40 --> 13082.00]  Because I don't hate the idea of getting off your phone more.
[13082.10 --> 13084.38]  You should watch the video anyway, cause it's going to be really funny.
[13084.48 --> 13085.02]  I probably will.
[13085.68 --> 13086.62]  Thanks for tuning in.
[13086.96 --> 13087.88]  We'll see you again next week.
[13088.06 --> 13089.44]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[13089.66 --> 13089.94]  Bye.
[13090.68 --> 13093.68]  Alright.
[13094.14 --> 13094.68]  Bye.
[13094.68 --> 13098.68]  I don't know why the show happened.
[13098.68 --> 13100.68]  Yeah.
[13100.68 --> 13104.68]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13104.68 --> 13106.68]  Oh, my legs.
[13106.68 --> 13108.68]  How long does that show?
[13108.68 --> 13110.68]  No.
[13110.68 --> 13112.68]  Um.
