[0.00 --> 4.96]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show! We've got a bunch of great topics for you guys
[4.96 --> 10.10]  today including a special guest! That's right we've got oh there he is he's kind of he's kind
[10.10 --> 13.06]  of in the middle of the frame now oh he's gonna he's leaning he's leaning oh he's leaning out of
[13.06 --> 20.90]  the frame now it's got that yeah we've got David on the show to talk about the incredible amount
[20.90 --> 26.56]  of effort that went into this year's April Fool's prank I'm really not quite sure how he pulled it
[26.56 --> 33.48]  off but you guys might not realize this if you're not subscribed to float plane we actually had a lot
[33.48 --> 40.72]  of those people working out of the house so it was the joke was that it wasn't really a joke so we're
[40.72 --> 46.12]  going to talk about everything that was involved in getting entire departments of the company moved
[46.12 --> 51.90]  into that residential house for almost a week for some of them yeah it seemed pretty inconvenient
[51.90 --> 58.82]  we're also going to be talking about how AI it turns out is just underpaid foreigners
[58.82 --> 63.82]  yeah it's like that always has been meme yeah exactly what else we got today
[63.82 --> 67.38]  uh uh discord wants you to monetize your friends
[67.38 --> 73.72]  that's I don't know about you guys but my friends are worthless so uh good luck with that discord
[73.72 --> 77.84]  I don't have any zero times zero situation
[77.84 --> 86.94]  uh I didn't even have another one I was just so focused on that intel mega fab uh possibly haunted
[86.94 --> 91.12]  yeah yeah that's the whole thing actually I guess
[91.12 --> 120.24]  see sonic square bis square paste square what would a square paste yeah it's our square paste yeah you
[120.24 --> 127.12]  walk like but you can only move in squares it's like artisanal uh toothpaste anyway squarespace and
[127.12 --> 134.40]  msi are the sponsors for the show today so I think we might as well jump right into what exactly went on
[134.40 --> 142.24]  over on float over on full plane it's been an extremely long actually couple weeks so the first thing that
[142.24 --> 148.72]  happened in order to make this april fools shoot work was uh because we accidentally double booked it with my
[148.72 --> 155.44]  vacation I actually had to fly home from Japan do you know this I didn't know that was why I had to
[155.44 --> 162.72]  come back a week early because we accidentally scheduled our vacation during the april fools shoot
[162.72 --> 167.64]  which couldn't be moved because you would think oh well surely we could have just gotten ready and done
[167.64 --> 172.88]  the shoot a little bit earlier but um I don't know maybe maybe we'll have David kind of talk about why that
[172.88 --> 179.22]  might not have been feasible well some people were speculating online that the house was you know in
[179.22 --> 184.80]  between tenants but no there's people living there currently and so we had to send them on vacation for
[184.80 --> 189.66]  two weeks so that we could have access to the house for two weeks and move all their stuff out oh my gosh
[189.66 --> 197.60]  yes when I heard that I it took me a second to like properly process what that meant yeah well the thing is
[197.60 --> 204.20]  like okay hold on sorry where did you even put it we paid for storage okay yeah so the idea was
[204.20 --> 209.90]  all right we're gonna move into the office but the tenants there are very much in the middle of their
[209.90 --> 216.32]  lease like this is this isn't like uh yeah we can get easy access to it some it's full of their stuff
[216.32 --> 225.96]  so I gotta say if I was them and my landlord called me up was like hey so here's the deal
[225.96 --> 233.86]  I want to move all your stuff out of your house for two weeks I'm gonna send you somewhere and then
[233.86 --> 239.72]  when you come back it's all gonna be moved back in probably in the same would you do it I'm think I
[239.72 --> 245.46]  think so would you would you take the deal free vacation let's say uh yeah let's say it was uh if
[245.46 --> 251.78]  there's some amount of assurance for like hey if we like break this thing we'll replace it I mean I can
[251.78 --> 256.68]  tell you they have nothing in writing I think it would really depend on the landlord but but maybe
[256.68 --> 261.78]  yeah David would you do it oh yeah my lord right now would you do it a hundred percent yeah I would
[261.78 --> 267.28]  take a free vacation like you could you go today today okay what about you Dan sure yeah yeah okay
[267.28 --> 273.78]  really okay doing it so apparently this is just a completely normal thing I would definitely I would
[273.78 --> 279.08]  definitely hesitate any of us are normal no not normal I can think of a lot of people that would
[279.08 --> 286.24]  never do this that's fair I'm just thinking like okay if I like take a couple small valuables and
[286.24 --> 292.16]  like store them on my parents place which I could do in like half an hour then yeah whatever just send
[292.16 --> 299.16]  it so I think one of the biggest challenges with this though was that David and I approached it with
[299.16 --> 305.24]  very different creative visions from the start so David why don't you talk them through what could
[305.24 --> 312.28]  have been and we'll let the audience kind of ruminate on it themselves because honestly the issue was not
[312.28 --> 318.84]  that his idea was bad in my opinion I think it was great it just wasn't what I had had in the back of
[318.84 --> 323.64]  my mind for the last two or three years or whenever I originally came up with this idea and I was like
[323.64 --> 330.04]  can we can we change this anyway so David you want to talk them through what you what you had
[330.04 --> 334.86]  thought of yeah absolutely yeah that first meeting we had was pretty contentious it got pretty heated
[334.86 --> 343.66]  um my idea was more mockumentary style so we're kind of doing it more skits uh room by room department
[343.66 --> 348.22]  by department and separating it more so that I could move people in and out of the house a little easier
[348.22 --> 353.56]  and we could you know have something set up for them but it doesn't have to actually uh be super
[353.56 --> 359.36]  real mr considerate over here meanwhile I'm like let's just move the company yeah and it was going
[359.36 --> 364.70]  to be definitely more absurd like one of the first jokes that I wrote and I think it was the the point
[364.70 --> 369.90]  at which we were diverting uh was like oh yeah we don't have enough power so we handed out typewriters
[369.90 --> 374.84]  for people to work on uh and it was going to be kind of more silly and absurd in that direction but
[374.84 --> 383.84]  Linus uh convinced me uh he he we we argued and then after a weekend of me cooling down
[383.84 --> 391.62]  I was convinced uh that that he was right and that having it be a real thing is something that
[391.62 --> 398.20]  you can't fake uh and so we decided that we were gonna really move people and set them up in this house
[398.20 --> 403.00]  and set up this real network infrastructure uh and bring real computers real monitors and have it that
[403.00 --> 408.06]  every single person at that house could do real work and I'm pretty sure that every single person
[408.06 --> 413.38]  that was in that video other than labs labs is probably the one yeah um they were really doing
[413.38 --> 420.62]  their job in that house yeah so that was what that was what um David told everybody was in order to make
[420.62 --> 426.74]  it feel lived in bring other like logistics will will bring in the monitors which were graciously
[426.74 --> 433.38]  provided by view sonic and um and land fest yeah um so the monitors were brought in from a third party
[433.38 --> 437.24]  but everyone was told okay other than the basic like we'll have buckets for you to sit on
[437.24 --> 443.04]  gather up kind of everything you can carry such that you could do a day's worth of work
[443.04 --> 449.86]  yeah and so that's why it really felt lived in and worked because the editors were actually editing
[449.86 --> 454.64]  real videos if you look if you watch the video because the turnaround for the april fools video was
[454.64 --> 461.84]  really fast if you screen peek you will see videos that are not out yet being worked on by the people
[461.84 --> 469.26]  sitting in the house one of one of the more insane meetings I've probably ever had was talking to David
[469.26 --> 474.30]  because I I got this like a message or something I don't remember what it was saying basically like
[474.30 --> 479.04]  yeah we need some like servers and cables and I was like oh okay we're just gonna like take some dead
[479.04 --> 483.36]  servers off the shelf we'll just lay them there and we'll just like toss some cables around so it looks
[483.36 --> 488.00]  like there's table tables in the thing he's like yes we need like a working mass so the editors can
[488.00 --> 494.40]  like be productive while we're there and I'm just like what is happening like how is this necessary for
[494.40 --> 501.66]  anyway so the part that David left out of the story from the pitch peating was that we reached a point
[501.66 --> 507.62]  where I felt like we were at a bit of an impasse and one of my favorite conflict resolution strategies
[507.62 --> 514.52]  is to bring in a third party to get a third opinion um in this case it was less of a third opinion and it
[514.52 --> 520.84]  was more of I feel like David was being so sensible and practical about everything he was trying to
[520.84 --> 524.90]  make sure that you brought in like the most because when he does this it's it's great he'll always bring
[524.90 --> 530.18]  in a loaded person he knows it's going to agree with his side oh I didn't so who did you pick no I
[530.18 --> 536.68]  didn't I didn't even I didn't oh fine Dave I'm not not David fine Luke who do you think I brought in
[536.68 --> 541.62]  then I don't know um well make a guess because you're not going to get it Elijah no
[541.62 --> 549.74]  come on come at me bro I don't know I don't know come at me Yvonne no
[549.74 --> 558.20]  where where was this meeting uh no no it took place in my office it was in my office okay yeah
[558.20 --> 561.92]  he's not gonna get he has no chance there was you might not remember but there's actually two
[561.92 --> 568.38]  people brought into this meeting oh oh oh I forgot about one of them fourth party okay okay oh oh oh
[568.38 --> 574.08]  you're right oh okay so first okay fine go ahead you get one more guess you haven't gotten either
[574.08 --> 579.14]  of them yet James okay yeah yeah James was the first one the second you said two people I was
[579.14 --> 583.36]  like well okay I forget what he said though David what did James say he was on your side almost right
[583.36 --> 589.54]  away and that's when I knew I was like okay maybe my brilliance is not true okay I forgot about that
[589.54 --> 594.08]  but it wasn't it I mean realistically I don't feel like you were digging in that much based on the
[594.08 --> 599.78]  difference in creative opinion it felt like a lot of it was just like everyone's gonna hate me
[599.78 --> 609.88]  and so that's a fair thing to be concerned about so the party I called in and where I think I
[609.88 --> 615.68]  actually got David to come around to it was I called Taryn okay yeah so I called him and I
[615.68 --> 622.18]  basically went okay here's the pitch I actually think I would have eventually got that as long as we
[622.18 --> 628.10]  as long as we make it clear to everyone that we understand that their deadlines are going to be
[628.10 --> 633.12]  pushed yeah and that their productivity is not going to stress people out and as long as I had
[633.12 --> 639.74]  Taryn's buy-in on the opportunity cost because like dude David I don't even know what the bill was for
[639.74 --> 645.08]  this I don't know exactly either does anybody know we should find we should find out I'm sure one of
[645.08 --> 651.42]  the accountants do I don't know if you want to find out yeah there's like no way it was worth it but
[651.42 --> 655.80]  the yeah so I don't even know what you're listening on a podcast format I did air quotes what the actual
[655.80 --> 662.56]  production bill was for this but it was probably if not certainly the highest cost production we have
[662.56 --> 668.98]  ever done and that even ignores the opportunity cost oh yeah because it's one thing to hire a bunch of
[668.98 --> 678.82]  talent to come in and produce a thing it's a whole other thing to shut down the I would say David how many
[678.82 --> 683.28]  people ultimately volunteered like what percentage of the company did we actually have in there I think
[683.28 --> 690.62]  total it was probably around 55 ish people okay so that's over half that's yeah okay because out of
[690.62 --> 697.60]  the locals that's almost 70 percent of the actual local staff then like 60 something percent that is
[697.60 --> 703.96]  absolutely wild so was anyone voluntold or was it all it was all voluntold it was all voluntold
[703.96 --> 709.30]  because I first would meet I first met with the managers and I was like hey uh you know can you
[709.30 --> 714.04]  pick people and I mean I don't know department by department how it went um but I basically was
[714.04 --> 719.48]  like hey just pick your people and then uh we'll we'll go from there everyone I've talked to about
[719.48 --> 726.54]  it was stoked on it so like oh you haven't talked to all the same people as me fun no everyone was such
[726.54 --> 732.46]  a good sport about it and like I think there was such a great energy being at the house um everyone was
[732.46 --> 737.38]  having a good time and it's rare that we get to do stuff like that all together and yeah it's even
[737.38 --> 742.66]  rare that we get to do that stuff with that many people for production and so I think it was kind of
[742.66 --> 747.98]  a real treat and everyone sort of cherished uh the days we were there I think for the people who weren't
[747.98 --> 755.42]  part of that um they the vibe for me was a lot like like old channel super fun when we would just like
[755.42 --> 759.72]  grab people out of their desks and be like okay we need to shoot a channel super fun guess what
[759.72 --> 765.58]  you're getting you know shot with nerf starts uh it's going to be a battle uh your team basement
[765.58 --> 772.02]  we're team addict let's go like like it really had that sort of chaotic vibe but I've got to give
[772.02 --> 779.18]  credit to David to the logistics team I've got to give credit to our partners it was shockingly
[779.18 --> 784.86]  organized we booked two days for the shoot and I don't think we went over one and a half
[784.86 --> 793.00]  oh not even we were like uh maybe nine hours of shooting absolutely yeah why actually super good
[793.00 --> 797.76]  yeah very difficult to do with any form of production yeah and the the number of moving
[797.76 --> 803.94]  parts there were in that mess the and it was this was David this was David being an absolute
[803.94 --> 812.30]  mad lad um I didn't intend well I thought of it as we got to the point in the script
[812.30 --> 819.56]  but David had was already way ahead of me the idea of actually shooting tech linked there oh yeah on
[819.56 --> 823.82]  the janky green screen that's not that's not me the thing the thing I was going to say before we
[823.82 --> 828.22]  started and you stopped me because you're like to hear for the show was that the the interwoven
[828.22 --> 835.52]  storylines was crazy and like easily my favorite part you've got way in show seeding interest you've
[835.52 --> 842.38]  got the the tech linked seeding interest uh you've got the the the prank at the end everyone's like
[842.38 --> 848.12]  what is this that's a float plane exclusive by the way float plane exclusive like this one video
[848.12 --> 853.82]  it's just like morphed into so many different there's there's so there's so much like ah
[853.82 --> 858.32]  there's so many layers to it yeah there's a short circuit that was shot in the hot tub yeah by the
[858.32 --> 862.32]  two jinks yeah yeah yeah I forgot about that but totally yeah yeah I knew about that that's
[862.32 --> 868.48]  yeah so many different things oh I freaking love it uh porto asks this is in the float plane chat did
[868.48 --> 874.86]  you guys had a had to talk with the neighbors so I did see one of our old neighbors you remember our
[874.86 --> 880.80]  neighbor on the one side who we we had I felt like a pretty cordial relationship with until I think she's
[880.80 --> 889.16]  a bit of a like vegetation enthusiast um oh and we had an arrangement me and Luke where his rent was
[889.16 --> 894.70]  significantly subsidized by his upkeep of the property yeah totally upkeep of the property that
[894.70 --> 902.82]  he just didn't do um they kept the internet going yeah the state of our lawn the state of our lawn was
[902.82 --> 908.42]  the straw and that's what it looked like it looked like straw was the straw that broke the camel's back
[908.42 --> 914.48]  and was what made the neighbors ultimately come and complain to the city and get us kicked out see
[914.48 --> 919.82]  I just I don't believe in short lawns because it's not good for the environment it's not good for the
[919.82 --> 924.66]  insects which are good for the the whole like ecological how do you explain the parts of it that were so
[924.66 --> 932.64]  short they were dirt uh so anyway uh you want to make space for new plants to grow so I saw that all
[932.64 --> 938.70]  just I saw that neighbor over the fence and uh I was in the middle of a take or something but she
[938.70 --> 945.74]  just like I don't have anything to do with yeah yeah she didn't say hi or anything so I'm like all
[945.74 --> 951.76]  right yeah I guess you didn't miss us yeah yeah that's okay I mean we were realistically we were only
[951.76 --> 957.98]  in there for probably about 80 hours like a little over three days did you ever tell her that I was
[957.98 --> 962.34]  supposed to upkeep the property I don't think so interesting because she was really good friends
[962.34 --> 967.32]  with me yeah all right I like helped her with something in her house one time I helped her move
[967.32 --> 972.76]  things in and out all the time like we were actually we were good I thought we were good too until it was
[972.76 --> 977.78]  actually her daughter that like came to the door and gave me a hard time about it interesting so I'm
[977.78 --> 982.26]  not a hundred percent convinced actually that she ever had a problem because she might have just like
[982.26 --> 986.36]  not recognized you to be honest yeah that's possible it's been a long time and if she had no primer
[986.36 --> 990.78]  that you were supposed to be there why would she think it was actually yeah that's true yeah yeah
[990.78 --> 995.68]  that's true that's true the thing I was most worried about with the neighbors was there was
[995.68 --> 1001.94]  six or seven days where we had moving trucks and it's a it's a compact street uh there's no parking
[1001.94 --> 1005.78]  spot so we would just double park this moving truck from different companies because there was
[1005.78 --> 1011.16]  different people that were involved uh and people would people were really nice which I was grateful for
[1011.16 --> 1015.50]  but I could tell by like the sixth or seventh day of a moving truck neighbors were starting to get
[1015.50 --> 1021.14]  curious about what was going on yeah nothing they'll go and they'll check and there'll be nothing
[1021.14 --> 1026.16]  everything's gone everything's clean the perfect crime man and some of the stuff we did was just
[1026.16 --> 1032.76]  could have caused an immediate call to the city like that shot we have of all the cars in the back alley
[1032.76 --> 1039.12]  I totally forgot about that how did you do that how was that okay we lucked out
[1039.12 --> 1048.32]  so hard David wasn't even coordinating it he was in one of the cars and I was I wasn't thinking about
[1048.32 --> 1053.24]  this at all I was like hey um it was Andrew shooting at that point I think right yeah I was
[1053.24 --> 1059.22]  like hey Andrew um you know what and people were kind of like pulling in and from both sides I was
[1059.22 --> 1064.42]  like Andrew maybe get like a pan shot I didn't mean immediately I just meant maybe get like a pan shot
[1064.42 --> 1069.44]  of all the cars because we wanted to feel like the whole alley was packed and it did didn't it yeah
[1069.44 --> 1076.50]  in the shot so he just starts doing it immediately and it just happened that everyone like like stopped
[1076.50 --> 1082.46]  right as he like clicked in right at the right yeah I was like David I don't think we need to do another
[1082.46 --> 1087.34]  take everyone get out of here it was so lucky too because I was really getting frustrated I was like I
[1087.34 --> 1091.58]  need I need five people in cars I need six people in cars any cars right now and no one was moving
[1091.58 --> 1096.66]  I was like oh goodness gracious and then eventually we got like four people that were there but then
[1096.66 --> 1101.04]  all the labs people rolled up just as we were doing it and so all of a sudden we have like eight or nine
[1101.04 --> 1108.80]  cars packed in there and it was it was perfect whose car had been keyed recently Colin Colin so we were
[1108.80 --> 1113.48]  able to get that key shot okay the amount of convincing that happened for the video too I don't know if we
[1113.48 --> 1120.60]  want to even say who it was but a certain news organization reached out asking for comment um okay
[1120.60 --> 1126.96]  this is why this is really funny that's crazy okay this is funny hold on so I'm gonna I'm not
[1126.96 --> 1132.84]  gonna say who it's from but I will say that this is a serious uh and then if I if while you look that
[1132.84 --> 1137.12]  up if I remember correctly there's a whole thread on the forum about how everyone was mind blown that
[1137.12 --> 1143.46]  you guys keyed a car for the video yeah there was a few people that were like oh you can see if you look
[1143.46 --> 1147.80]  frame by frame that it's freaky it pointed out but a lot of people were convinced no andrew's
[1147.80 --> 1154.86]  andrew were he man he worked the camera we worked the angle so good okay so this is this is the email
[1154.86 --> 1162.54]  sent to me and our ceo yeah um hey guys sorry to be shooting you a work email on easter sunday
[1162.54 --> 1167.26]  saw this super odd post on threads from your account and wanted to reach out to confirm whether it's real
[1167.26 --> 1174.28]  or a joke i've attached a screenshot um it's just and it's that one that's like guess who's moving
[1174.28 --> 1183.22]  you notice of eviction dear uh something of linus media group we regret to inform you due to your
[1183.22 --> 1187.28]  continued failure to make mortgage payments blah blah blah blah blah it was just part of this it was
[1187.28 --> 1194.74]  part of the whole april fools bit yeah oh man i recognize the the meme yeah i i i love that um
[1194.74 --> 1202.58]  you know what no i think this might identify the outlet so i'm not going to i'm not going to yeah
[1202.58 --> 1205.90]  i think my favorite fake out was there was a brand that reached out and was like oh can we get your
[1205.90 --> 1211.72]  new address we need to send some stuff to you and it was like no i didn't hear that yeah
[1211.72 --> 1219.92]  cool that they still wanted to support yeah yeah i mean even though i you know i had we had our
[1219.92 --> 1226.44]  accountants looking up how to commit tax uh tax fraud and i outright said that you know sponsors
[1226.44 --> 1231.08]  weren't going to get stuff back they're like yeah we've been paid before yeah sure it should be fine
[1231.08 --> 1237.30]  fine he's good for it i mean he couldn't go to the same country as p diddy
[1237.30 --> 1243.10]  it's true i don't have a private plane
[1243.10 --> 1243.82]  yeah
[1243.82 --> 1244.82]  yeah
[1244.82 --> 1253.82]  yeah just a vision room yeah yeah exactly you like you like raising up into the thing that i broke at
[1253.82 --> 1258.84]  that moment you know what's really funny is i screwed up the take i had my eyes closed
[1258.84 --> 1266.24]  oh my god that's really funny i was like hey david i think we gotta redo that take because i
[1266.24 --> 1272.46]  i had my eyes closed it was so good and then we're like you know what no that's actually kind of funny
[1272.46 --> 1282.20]  oh man the the behind the scenes is over an hour and even though i was there for almost all of it i
[1282.20 --> 1286.44]  almost all of the actual shooting of the behind the scenes i wasn't there for a lot of the setup
[1286.44 --> 1292.32]  because i was on vacation i come in jet-lagged as heck kind of with a little bit of trepidation
[1292.32 --> 1297.48]  no offense no offense understandably little bit of trepidation this is a major major investment
[1297.48 --> 1303.64]  one that we have absolutely no hope whatsoever of recouping any any of our of our costs from
[1303.64 --> 1311.50]  straight up tax write-off oh straight up tax write-off we lost so much money on this production
[1311.50 --> 1314.80]  oh yeah all the money and so i'm coming into this shoot going okay
[1314.80 --> 1320.62]  you know we had a good script review i think everything's in probably in pretty good shape i
[1320.62 --> 1325.96]  think it's incapable hands but you never know well it's my first big project um and it was enormous
[1325.96 --> 1332.14]  yes yes so there's there's there's so many moving pieces and so much that could go wrong
[1332.14 --> 1340.02]  and i walked in the door and i i had not intended for it to be in the cut of the youtube video when i
[1340.02 --> 1346.44]  walk in the door and i just lose it right because it was the intention was for me to be more like in
[1346.44 --> 1355.28]  my just like you know a***** character right um but when i saw the rough cut for review and i saw that
[1355.28 --> 1359.82]  they had left it in i went you know what it kind of it kind of works but that was it i hadn't seen it
[1359.82 --> 1366.44]  yet that was that was the moment i walked in the door i was like okay because i saw all the editors
[1366.44 --> 1375.64]  there dude the the four person desks with it that's so funny like i just i i can't that's all david the
[1375.64 --> 1382.96]  bunk desk that was so funny i i did and like how it's actually efficient sort of and yeah you can fit a
[1382.96 --> 1389.78]  lot of people like hold on a second this this kind of works yeah why why is this like why does
[1389.78 --> 1394.32]  this work in my head this shouldn't work at all why why am i sort of okay with this but also not
[1394.32 --> 1400.68]  and then watching people like i think you had to like crawl over someone oh my goodness it's just so
[1400.68 --> 1404.86]  good it's so good i want to clarify that one wasn't my idea and it's it's one of those things that
[1404.86 --> 1410.60]  it's like i had so many meetings and like brainstorm sessions that it's such a mishmash of a million
[1410.60 --> 1415.50]  idea so i don't want to take credit for too much but uh i'll take credit for some of it yeah yeah
[1415.50 --> 1422.20]  i mean absolutely a team effort was it justin who put together the like bunk desks and like
[1422.20 --> 1428.58]  so that was so early on i recruited logistics in order to make things possible and i'm someone that
[1428.58 --> 1432.94]  doesn't like to ask for help i'm a i just want to do it myself i'll i'll put in the legwork this was
[1432.94 --> 1436.86]  too much but it was impossible so this was a good it was a great exercise for me because i had to
[1436.86 --> 1441.32]  communicate with people and be like okay i need help um and so they were really good about
[1441.32 --> 1445.56]  finding smart solutions like i remember going to justin being like okay i need this bunk desk
[1445.56 --> 1451.70]  for socials to sit in he's like just use the shelf and i was like i was like oh yeah okay yeah when i
[1451.70 --> 1456.92]  saw that i was like oh smart that was really funny yeah yeah um and the same with the desks i had given
[1456.92 --> 1461.28]  him a drawing of like oh here's kind of like what i had in mind and he and then logistics i think alex
[1461.28 --> 1466.34]  was like can we just put a desk on top of another desk i was like yeah okay sure fine
[1466.34 --> 1472.38]  uh the informed retreat asks the only thing i'm trying to figure out is does gary actually like
[1472.38 --> 1478.62]  arc at all obviously he's holding intel stock but linus can you comment don't read too much into a
[1478.62 --> 1483.82]  joke there is knowing gary do you guys have any idea what his background is the guy's the guy's
[1483.82 --> 1490.48]  ethical there's no way he's holding intel stock and boosting arc what gary is an enthusiast for
[1490.48 --> 1498.08]  is exciting innovative new technology that's why the guy it is buys dumb stuff like quad fx that's
[1498.08 --> 1506.40]  why he buys into and daily drive stuff like arc so that he was there if it takes off he was there
[1506.40 --> 1514.78]  before it took off he's an early adopter um to a fault right his personal computer is like super sick
[1514.78 --> 1521.62]  yeah of course it is it's not necessary yeah it's gary yeah yeah exactly yeah um so fits the bill he
[1521.62 --> 1529.12]  he likes the idea of there being another competitor in the gpu space and so should you and to be clear
[1529.12 --> 1532.54]  when i say his personal computer is super sick i don't mean he just like bought expensive parts and
[1532.54 --> 1537.48]  put it in a box it's like very artfully done and took some craftsmanship if i remember correctly
[1537.48 --> 1541.68]  it's hardline water cooled it's very nice it's been a long time since i've seen it but it's very nice
[1541.68 --> 1548.70]  yeah uh man there's honestly there's like there's so much that we could talk about um
[1548.70 --> 1558.78]  oh man there's a lot of jokes that did not make it into uh the youtube video or because because the
[1558.78 --> 1563.06]  script was kind of rough like there's scripted parts but then there's parts of the script that
[1563.06 --> 1569.76]  just say crawl around on you know the people in this area and interact with them a little bit right
[1569.76 --> 1576.96]  and so man we had uh did the did the line about the the clothes being red because of the blood of
[1576.96 --> 1581.50]  the people the underpaid people who were making them did that make it into the cut the blood making
[1581.50 --> 1587.64]  the shirt red did make it in but it did i think it was sarah's blood though oh no that's a separate
[1587.64 --> 1593.70]  thing sarah's blood is on the merch shirt and we're like why is there blood on this shirt oh because
[1593.70 --> 1599.24]  i put blood sweat and tears okay got it got it got it got it um yeah anyway there's there's some stuff
[1599.24 --> 1606.44]  that definitely didn't make it in the the energy was it was great was incredible yeah i just you
[1606.44 --> 1611.46]  could tell people it's the kind of thing that feels like a chore in the moment or like as you're getting
[1611.46 --> 1616.08]  ready for it but then you do it and then it's over and you look back on it and you're like i'm glad i'm
[1616.08 --> 1621.74]  glad i participated in type two fun i the best kind of fun i couldn't believe the commitment to the bit
[1621.74 --> 1628.98]  when i got out to the backyard found out that the hot tub heater doesn't work and jake belavance
[1628.98 --> 1636.34]  wait it actually didn't it works but it takes like 24 hours plus of heat heating and i couldn't
[1636.34 --> 1640.82]  leave it overnight because i'm not watching it and so every hour the day before and every hour that
[1640.82 --> 1645.12]  morning i got there like three hours early to put it in to give it a chance uh but it made no difference
[1645.12 --> 1650.32]  it was freezing it was freaking cold and it was actively raining wasn't it and the fact that jake
[1650.32 --> 1656.76]  belavance and jake tivey were like bell was in there a long time long time because he was in there
[1656.76 --> 1663.78]  from when we shot the ltt when we shot that portion of it i didn't realize they were separate that makes
[1663.78 --> 1672.78]  sense until jake tivey arrived and got in with them and then shot that entire short circuit video oh man
[1672.78 --> 1681.22]  i i i i couldn't believe it like the and the poor editors like they were there almost all day
[1681.22 --> 1687.58]  on their buckets oh they weren't sitting on buckets they were sitting on the ground oh right their
[1687.58 --> 1693.58]  desk was made of buckets buckets yeah i got it i got a pretty good idea of what the vibe was going to
[1693.58 --> 1699.56]  be like when david messaged the general chat and he goes hey does anyone have any camping chairs or
[1699.56 --> 1707.44]  five gallon buckets i need as many as i can get it wasn't the whip and pillory that uh that tipped
[1707.44 --> 1716.28]  you off i didn't see that fun fact that riding crop that dennis is using to hit gary with during the uh
[1716.28 --> 1722.48]  the torture scene yeah we already had that yeah create a warehouse that's some upcoming merch
[1722.48 --> 1732.04]  our new lineup oh my it was actually an inspiration piece for the ultimate cat teaser
[1732.04 --> 1741.04]  uh yeah because i had told those guys i wanted the quality to be um kind of similar to like a like a
[1741.04 --> 1747.28]  leather wrapped riding crop however i uh that one is clearly for play
[1747.28 --> 1755.78]  i had meant more like an actual riding crop you know you know the like type of people when you you
[1755.78 --> 1761.32]  ask for that and they don't go to like stampede they go to a slightly different organization to
[1761.32 --> 1768.52]  acquire one yeah it's like hmm anywho because we have like literally down the road yeah there's a shop
[1768.52 --> 1777.42]  you could buy an actual one for horses i know like i know pretty cool yeah now that it's over
[1777.42 --> 1782.86]  are you ready for the next one oh i thought we weren't doing another one we're never doing april
[1782.86 --> 1785.34]  fools again that is true april fools
[1785.34 --> 1794.92]  so did did you did you was it worth it it was definitely worth it and uh i had a good time doing
[1794.92 --> 1800.52]  it i was very exhausted i'm still like kind of recovering but uh i go on vacation next week so
[1800.52 --> 1806.08]  nice it's perfect timing nice um but yeah it was a thrill uh this is kind of the projects the kind
[1806.08 --> 1811.76]  of projects i want to do so i'm uh i was very happy to be doing it all right cool all right thanks david
[1811.76 --> 1817.82]  appreciate you sticking around with us for uh for a pretty late day for watch oh wait no sorry hold
[1817.82 --> 1823.90]  on i can't let you go just yet um speaking of you being tired okay yeah there's um we have some i
[1823.90 --> 1829.54]  forgot we had some merch messages um pertaining to this uh robert l asks uh this year's april fools
[1829.54 --> 1834.00]  video was probably top three for me uh how far out do you start planning writing and shooting the april
[1834.00 --> 1843.48]  fools videos well we started next year's so that gives you an indication uh i was brought in
[1843.48 --> 1850.00]  to this one a few months ago uh and there'd already been the idea uh and i was kind of given
[1850.00 --> 1853.88]  like hey write a script and or come up with ideas and we'll talk to linus and stuff so it's been
[1853.88 --> 1859.38]  probably three-ish months that has really been sort of in progress and then the last three weeks
[1859.38 --> 1867.34]  here for me have been 100 dedicated to this um maybe like 90 i have other stuff to do but um so
[1867.34 --> 1872.52]  it's three months of planning kind of going and then three four weeks of like full tilt
[1872.52 --> 1879.90]  making it happen i'm trying to see here when we asked the tenants um if they were chill with it
[1879.90 --> 1887.20]  uh november 20th wow was when we was when we pivoted because we had originally planned something else
[1887.20 --> 1893.98]  and we realized that it was not going to be possible to execute in time i think i was still a
[1893.98 --> 1900.46]  shooter at that point yeah so that was that was our initial outreach um oh no that wasn't even initial
[1900.46 --> 1905.16]  outreach that was like yvonne connecting everyone to talk about it in more detail
[1905.16 --> 1915.32]  uh wait what did ludwig just do what did ludwig just do oh no oh no we have a curse ludwig video
[1915.32 --> 1919.90]  released during wandshow whoa whoa whoa whoa what is this what did he do what is this about is this
[1919.90 --> 1924.32]  is this is this something to ludwig video just dropped okay hold on why is everyone talking about
[1924.32 --> 1932.78]  this oh no stop doing this emergency stream is that it that's live right now i don't think so
[1932.78 --> 1944.10]  oh okay they're confused float plane notification you mean our ludwig video oh oh oh the ludwig video
[1944.10 --> 1951.02]  is out oh okay well that's probably bad timing uh anywho well let's continue with wandshow yeah yeah
[1951.02 --> 1955.32]  floaters are floaters have got a lot of content to watch okay sorry let me just see if there's a
[1955.32 --> 1962.36]  couple of other i love you guys calling them floaters is aaron asks the april fools joke seemed
[1962.36 --> 1968.28]  like a lot of work what was the most difficult thing the most difficult stunt to pull off
[1968.28 --> 1976.14]  i think it's the people i think there's some departments that were like super on board and
[1976.14 --> 1982.60]  there's some that i had to make it just so many accommodations for uh and i had to make a lot of
[1982.60 --> 1988.22]  my work was making sure that they could arrive at the house and start working um because they were
[1988.22 --> 1993.40]  more concerned with making sure that they weren't losing productivity uh and so because some deadlines
[1993.40 --> 1998.98]  are not even they're not self-imposed yeah they're not management imposed they're like government
[1998.98 --> 2005.24]  imposed so i'm sure accounting had some concerns about like hitting deadlines well they weren't too bad i
[2005.24 --> 2010.84]  don't want to name the department i'm not i don't want to do that fair enough fair enough but i think
[2010.84 --> 2019.00]  no no um but i think it's getting the people there is the hardest part there's no like single prop that
[2019.00 --> 2025.68]  was super hard um it's just like timing the people having it all work out and i think like i just
[2025.68 --> 2031.28]  we got so lucky that everything was lining up uh and there was no huge issues and it was like spitting
[2031.28 --> 2036.02]  rain sometimes but it didn't rain too much and the times we really needed to be outside and walking
[2036.02 --> 2042.18]  around it let up and like oh there was a lot that went right it kind of reminded me of some of those
[2042.18 --> 2047.72]  old uh like production ad production shoots way back in the day for like asus and funk and stuff like
[2047.72 --> 2053.48]  that where like oh yeah i'm sure it had started if the wind had picked up like this 20 minutes earlier
[2053.48 --> 2059.18]  we wouldn't have gotten the shoot done and if the if the if the water seal had broken on the camera
[2059.18 --> 2063.06]  you know five minutes earlier we wouldn't have finished getting the shoot and like just
[2063.06 --> 2070.48]  it reminded me of the old days in more ways than one uh all right let me see if there's uh any other
[2070.48 --> 2076.08]  ones here the old days as far as i can tell we have fairly diligently after the fact labeled all of
[2076.08 --> 2080.36]  the april fools video with april fools joke at the beginning of the title so if you want to look up our
[2080.36 --> 2086.56]  old videos it's actually pretty easy to do i wanted to look at our 2013 one and found that a lot of them
[2086.56 --> 2095.36]  are are labeled april fools 2016 april fools joke well luke do you know why no because we had to
[2095.36 --> 2105.16]  because too many people believed oh it was actually causing problems and before you guys say hey um
[2105.16 --> 2111.02]  oh yes oh yeah we'll do that right away uh before you guys say they're they're probably trolls minus
[2111.02 --> 2118.50]  you're falling for the no you have no idea i can tell the difference after we labeled it april fools
[2118.50 --> 2124.38]  this this should tell you after we labeled it april fools the problem went away yeah but a significant
[2124.38 --> 2131.64]  number of our previous april fools have needed the label sooner rather than later or it's been a real
[2131.64 --> 2138.02]  problem that's pretty funny yeah i i just i don't really know what uh i don't really know what to say
[2138.02 --> 2143.58]  other than i think was it george carlin who famously said think of an average person
[2143.58 --> 2153.84]  half of people are dumber than that i i still i still love the fractal design r4 unboxing april fools
[2153.84 --> 2159.84]  it's just like i i adore this type of humor was it your idea to just leave it there for 11 minutes
[2159.84 --> 2165.40]  yeah because back then i hear we'll go to luke's laptop right uh no back back then that was the
[2165.40 --> 2170.60]  typical length of our videos and uh there was no preview like that there was no thumbnail preview
[2170.60 --> 2177.12]  yeah or um like uh like a timeline preview that's the one so the video was just um yeah 10 minutes of
[2177.12 --> 2181.86]  it just sitting in the yard so this was i think the third time i had unboxed this case yeah the first
[2181.86 --> 2188.80]  time i unboxed it again so the second time i unboxed it was because i forgot yes i legitimately it's pretty
[2188.80 --> 2195.70]  made an entire new unboxing about the define r4 not realizing i had already done it you know you've
[2195.70 --> 2201.02]  unboxed too many things when yeah and then yeah you drop it yeah i just i just find this so funny
[2201.02 --> 2213.00]  uh i don't even know what i'm saying i watched the server room on fire one that one's not funny
[2213.00 --> 2220.08]  yeah i i because my kids asked if we had ever done a prank on our staff for april fools and that
[2220.08 --> 2225.96]  one if i recall correctly you guys didn't know didn't know but like figured it out i guess uh
[2225.96 --> 2230.40]  pretty quickly well it was the reactions like really bad yeah it's just it just like isn't funny
[2230.40 --> 2237.30]  and the fire pole one is not very good but i'd say the rest of the fire pole meme lived for far too
[2237.30 --> 2244.42]  luke the fire pole meme is still alive still alive still alive david can you tell us when was the
[2244.42 --> 2250.32]  last sighting of the fire pole it's in the april fools video okay people kept saying this i didn't
[2250.32 --> 2255.92]  see it it's very short i'll show you if you're watching that video there's a 11 more minutes
[2255.92 --> 2262.06]  of nothing other than that case just sitting in the grass it's it's amazing that's my type of april
[2262.06 --> 2270.60]  yeah i i love that kind of stuff um so hold on got ads what is this ad okay so here's a here's a
[2270.60 --> 2276.16]  video oh look we've got david just floating here i love it hello david um he looks like a suggested
[2276.16 --> 2284.28]  video i get click on me click on me please i get credit for this one go linus uh but going out my
[2284.28 --> 2292.68]  executive exit oh wait no no no let's go a little bit further uh where did i go oh yeah here we go
[2292.68 --> 2298.54]  here we go here we go going out my executive exit okay this is david the executive exit just like out
[2298.54 --> 2305.60]  the window so i don't have to see everyone i totally ripped that oh did you see it i didn't
[2305.60 --> 2309.28]  like put together it was supposed to be the fire pole i thought it was just like a drain pipe or something
[2309.28 --> 2310.68]  so i go out and
[2310.68 --> 2320.32]  that's really funny actually dude this video is worth watching at minimum five times yeah i didn't really
[2320.32 --> 2324.72]  think about watching it again but i feel like i have there are especially for someone who actually
[2324.72 --> 2332.86]  worked out of this office it is so full of inside jokes and references to the old days and
[2332.86 --> 2339.74]  random weird little easter eggs and props i don't think that if you gave me six months to do it on my
[2339.74 --> 2344.68]  own right like this is not something that could have been done in one mind many minds i couldn't
[2344.68 --> 2350.36]  have come up with this many references and i worked there the whole time yeah like i yeah it's absolutely
[2350.36 --> 2354.84]  brilliant people are like whoa i missed that someone said why didn't you watch on a float plane
[2354.84 --> 2359.38]  which is a pretty good question that is a good question yeah the reason is because i didn't have
[2359.38 --> 2362.70]  another float plane window oh no i did have another float plane window open okay i usually don't have
[2362.70 --> 2366.46]  a second float plane window open and then i always screw up redirect the live and i go somewhere else it
[2366.46 --> 2371.10]  takes away my chat and there's a solution to that there's a very easy solution to that but i just am in
[2371.10 --> 2376.34]  the habit of not browsing float plane because i i do this i always do it and then it closes my chat yeah
[2376.34 --> 2382.68]  um i just wanted to razz you yeah oh man so yeah float plane if you are not subscribed on float plane
[2382.68 --> 2387.86]  now is the time to do it there's a couple of reasons for that one is that pricing is actually
[2387.86 --> 2396.24]  going up in a little while i've heard about this um but because of our commitment to uh to to to
[2396.24 --> 2402.86]  honoring our agreements uh anyone who subscribes at old pricing will be grandfathered in at that pricing
[2402.86 --> 2408.62]  that's cool uh because i haven't confirmed we can do that yet so we'll figure it out no they have
[2408.62 --> 2415.50]  to be okay yeah it has to be it has this is the way sick uh yep anyway so thanks yeah minus lead
[2415.50 --> 2420.52]  development yeah um i'm pretty sure it'll be fine we already have a grandfathering system i just don't
[2420.52 --> 2425.10]  know about extending it to multiple tiers but all right we'll figure it out so we'll make it work
[2425.10 --> 2431.36]  and uh the other the other reason is that it is full of amazing content right now they did spring
[2431.36 --> 2438.38]  break on float plane um which involved a whole bunch of exclusives so we've got labs hide and seek
[2438.38 --> 2446.82]  we've got extras from the bidet shoot with uh ludwig we've got tanner revisiting black lab computers he
[2446.82 --> 2451.86]  went back for a six month update to see what it looks like now there was the departmental airplane
[2451.86 --> 2458.20]  paper airplane battle um which i totally won don't bother uh checking extras from the world's biggest
[2458.20 --> 2464.04]  gaming screen and of course the hour and a half long behind the scenes that uh the reviews are in
[2464.04 --> 2472.76]  and people are loving it's good it has an infinity like dislike ratio um i was i was pretty upset at
[2472.76 --> 2475.84]  you in the video because you keep being like the behind the scenes is gonna be better than video and
[2475.84 --> 2480.08]  i was like screw you the video's gonna be great but uh you're right the behind the scenes is better
[2480.08 --> 2486.24]  well it's not i didn't mean that in like an insulting way i just meant there was so much
[2486.24 --> 2492.30]  depth to everything that was going on that there was absolutely no possible way that it could be
[2492.30 --> 2499.78]  absorbed in a youtube video length there was no possible way so the behind the scenes has all this
[2499.78 --> 2506.34]  additional context and all this additional interaction uh you get to see you know just everyone
[2506.34 --> 2513.14]  kind of goofing around like the energy on the shoot was so positive i've already it's so long
[2513.14 --> 2519.18]  that i haven't had time to watch it but i have literally marked out time to watch it tomorrow uh i'm
[2519.18 --> 2525.92]  genuinely quite excited i think the best uh the best review of it that i saw was someone saying i clicked
[2525.92 --> 2533.66]  it without checking the time stamp and then didn't check how long i'd been watching and i was an hour and 15
[2533.66 --> 2539.52]  minutes into it that's a that's a good review that's a good stream they watched a movie yeah so
[2539.52 --> 2544.88]  kudos to the social team for putting that together and of course the editing team helps by kind of
[2544.88 --> 2552.28]  earmarking bits that don't make the cut um but they but they do go into the behind the scenes and uh
[2552.28 --> 2558.46]  oh yeah i got to give credit to sammy for just being an absolute unit because while you know andrew did
[2558.46 --> 2564.58]  awesome you know getting the the real video shot the youtube video shot when andrew could turn off
[2564.58 --> 2573.88]  his camera and take a break i mean sammy had to keep rolling um yeah anyway now's a really good time
[2573.88 --> 2578.16]  to get subscribed over on floatplane we've got a ton of really great content over there and of course
[2578.16 --> 2584.36]  the entire back catalog as well all right i think that was it for merch messages that were explicitly
[2584.36 --> 2589.64]  directed at david okay now that we started acknowledging them a couple more of them
[2589.64 --> 2596.14]  came in um okay no no okay no i think i think you're good i think you're good david i think
[2596.14 --> 2601.54]  that i wanted to ask chat question because i haven't seen very many comments one about my favorite joke
[2601.54 --> 2606.76]  in the entire video which is the mad max joke where a hundred people enter one person gets rich
[2606.76 --> 2611.20]  and i'm very disappointed no one has commented about that because i think that's a brilliant joke
[2611.20 --> 2616.62]  oh i thought it was hilarious yeah because it's one of those things i was a little worried about
[2616.62 --> 2623.66]  because you know i mean you know how reddit can be uh the the fact that the fact that actors have to
[2623.66 --> 2631.16]  have it in their contract that they can't like be mean as part of their character because then fans
[2631.16 --> 2636.28]  might not like them anymore they might think they're mean like that kind of thing the fact that that has to
[2636.28 --> 2642.60]  exist i mean george carlin once did a bit about how you know okay whatever we've talked about this
[2642.60 --> 2648.84]  already um but that was one of those lines that honestly i read it that's david's line that's not my line
[2648.84 --> 2650.80]  um i read it and i went
[2650.80 --> 2661.94]  can i trust the audience to be smart enough to know that this is a line i am playing a character
[2661.94 --> 2668.10]  and i wasn't sure but i thought it was so funny and i thought it was so worth it that
[2668.10 --> 2672.64]  that was one in before it got to you i was told i don't think people will get that you should cut it
[2672.64 --> 2677.34]  and i was like i will not i will fight it has to make it one of the things that i liked about that
[2677.34 --> 2683.72]  was even if you didn't get it from like a mad max reference it's still funny yeah it still works
[2683.72 --> 2688.76]  yeah so and it's just more funny if you get the reference the other thing i was wondering too i wish
[2688.76 --> 2695.50]  we had a tracker but we we we had that ps5 uh jailbreaking joke that has a link in the
[2695.50 --> 2700.24]  description because we faked you know the the just the the ui to make it look like we had a
[2700.24 --> 2706.68]  hacked ps5 and if you click the link it's a rickroll and i really wish i could know how many people
[2706.68 --> 2711.48]  click that link with oh did we not use a track to your i didn't know that was a thing we have one
[2711.48 --> 2715.64]  shit if you want something like that in the future just let me know okay we we have our own set up
[2715.64 --> 2719.88]  for sponsors chat some of you guys can let me know what uh how many people
[2719.88 --> 2727.14]  that's all i wanted to know
[2727.14 --> 2736.52]  that's awesome hate and love you clicked it i clicked it clicked it yeah and twitch chat yeah i
[2736.52 --> 2742.26]  mean well those guys are idiots so i'm i love you twitch i love you twitch chat i love you watch ads
[2742.26 --> 2747.64]  watch ads um colton colton turned the ads back on that's why the ads are back on
[2747.64 --> 2752.54]  ah so i remember i kept turning them off yeah yeah so colton turned them on he told me not to touch it
[2752.54 --> 2752.86]  anymore
[2752.86 --> 2760.86]  okay all right fine buddy so good all right all right thank you so much for hanging around today
[2760.86 --> 2766.06]  david my pleasure thank you so much for having me all right take care see ya bye bye thank you
[2766.06 --> 2770.80]  all right moving on to your regularly scheduled programming oh wait are you gonna no before we
[2770.80 --> 2774.88]  do that oh we got to talk about our collaboration i was just gonna say are you gonna suit up yeah
[2774.88 --> 2780.54]  dog yeah you guys might have two different sizes in there oh okay hold on i'll make sure i get the
[2780.54 --> 2784.10]  right size then i don't remember actually this seems like the kind of thing that david would want hey
[2784.10 --> 2789.42]  david yeah before you wander off let me just see if i have your size here i think you'd be into this
[2789.42 --> 2796.00]  uh we got one extra are you a medium or a large uh probably large these days no oh i need medium
[2796.00 --> 2802.94]  womp womp okay all right check this out check this out we heard from the terry fox foundation
[2802.94 --> 2808.50]  who we have never actually collaborated with even though we've talked about terry a little bit on
[2808.50 --> 2816.16]  the show before and um basically the extent of it is that they were like hey it would be super chill
[2816.16 --> 2821.70]  uh if you guys if you guys wore the shirts that we're doing this year and then there's a hold on
[2821.70 --> 2827.76]  there's a message inside here ah here it is uh that i just wanted to read actually here uh luke do you
[2827.76 --> 2831.62]  want to read this because i'm probably going to cry if i do it so um i'm just going to change into my
[2831.62 --> 2839.36]  shirt all right i'm gonna throw mine on thanks david it would be a really funny combination of you like
[2839.36 --> 2845.54]  flexing in the shirt him crying and i'm reading out the note i would find that very entertaining
[2845.54 --> 2851.86]  uh yeah the terry fox foundation terry's courage and determination to always keep going no matter
[2851.86 --> 2856.86]  what continues to inspire millions of canadians 44 years after his iconic marathon of hope
[2856.86 --> 2862.76]  the terry fox foundation is kicking off the 2024 terry fox run by once again teaming up with ryan
[2862.76 --> 2868.86]  reynolds to launch a limited edition shirt that features the tagline no matter what as a reminder
[2868.86 --> 2874.52]  of terry's strength persistence and commitment to fundraise for cancer research canadians can now order
[2874.52 --> 2879.82]  the limited edition shirt at terry fox.org with all proceeds supporting critical cancer research
[2879.82 --> 2885.70]  in canada we encourage you to share a photo wearing the shirt alongside a caption outlining how you'll
[2885.70 --> 2892.30]  honor terry's dream of a world without cancer tagging at terry fox foundation and hashtag no matter what
[2892.30 --> 2898.06]  on april 12th the same day that terry began his marathon of hope in 1980 canadians will be able to
[2898.06 --> 2903.84]  register and begin fundraising for this year's terry fox run which will take place on sunday september 15th
[2903.84 --> 2910.80]  2024 thank you so much for your support absolute chad how did i read that i don't know properly
[2910.80 --> 2916.40]  i don't know that's it's an important message apparently apparently you can you can you got
[2916.40 --> 2922.48]  another gear man uh so guys go check that out we're gonna we're gonna throw uh dan do you mind
[2922.48 --> 2926.42]  throwing some links in the in the chat for everyone and we'll throw that in the video description
[2926.42 --> 2931.52]  absolutely absolutely yeah there was uh i think this was supposed to go out next week but uh registration
[2931.52 --> 2938.42]  for the fox run will open on april 12th oh okay uh did did we jump the gun i think so i'll throw
[2938.42 --> 2944.54]  some uh i thought we were late we ended up being early uh well you know what we can give it another
[2944.54 --> 2949.60]  shout out yeah we're gonna give we're gonna get you guys a reminder next week okay so uh let's dan
[2949.60 --> 2953.16]  do you mind actually making a note of that as well to make sure that we get a reminder in there next
[2953.16 --> 2957.68]  week can they buy the shirt now though i am unsure there's already people in full plane chat saying
[2957.68 --> 2962.30]  they're donating already okay great well you can always just donate like that's cool too because
[2962.30 --> 2968.62]  like the shirts i mean you know it's no lt t-shirt but yeah yeah it's it's a cool shirt but realistically
[2968.62 --> 2973.68]  what they need is not shirt sales what they need is money uh the terry fox foundation has done
[2973.68 --> 2979.36]  absolutely incredible work over the last four and a half decades uh in the fight against cancer and you
[2979.36 --> 2987.12]  know what cancer um let me just i do like both the shirts are cool but your long sleeve having the
[2987.12 --> 2992.94]  writing on the arm is like pretty sweet there we go i think it's that way yeah no matter what let's go
[2992.94 --> 2999.40]  that's pretty cool all right so uh here it is just head on over to ways to give over here you can
[2999.40 --> 3006.62]  donate once you can donate monthly um yeah absolutely incredible incredible organization do they
[3006.62 --> 3013.10]  all right thanks dan oh show off the back of the shirt hold on what's on the back there is writing
[3013.10 --> 3018.66]  on the back oh yeah there we go okay hold on you want to read it for me no matter the distance no
[3018.66 --> 3024.22]  matter the obstacles no matter the journey no matter the odds no matter what uh terry fox run for cancer
[3024.22 --> 3036.60]  research all right cool yeah ah um okay should we jump right into the show yes oh what are you
[3036.60 --> 3042.94]  you want to do should we do should we do ai as just underpaid foreigners yeah yeah let's do it all
[3042.94 --> 3051.08]  right let's do it amazon amazon will be phasing out its cashierless checkout system called just walk
[3051.08 --> 3057.52]  out which launched in 2016 you may remember that was one of my first big controversies actually it
[3057.52 --> 3061.66]  might have been might have been the first big one i think that was the first time i was ever covered
[3061.66 --> 3069.18]  in mainstream news who never talks about me unless it's something negative yeah um yeah so uh it
[3069.18 --> 3076.20]  launched in 2016 we went and checked out the amazon go store which uh was in seattle and was the very
[3076.20 --> 3083.74]  very first prototype of that um it was available at 27 of their 44 amazon fresh grocery stores
[3083.74 --> 3090.14]  and the idea was that it was supposed to allow customers to scan in at the door then have the
[3090.14 --> 3096.08]  items that they pick up tallied and automatically rung up by a machine vision system using cameras
[3096.08 --> 3100.28]  and sensors my understanding was it was more than just cameras like there were weight sensors on
[3100.28 --> 3108.04]  on the shelves and stuff like that however it was recently revealed that the system was actually
[3108.04 --> 3115.60]  heavily dependent on a large team of over a thousand overseas workers based mostly in india
[3115.60 --> 3121.58]  now when i say underpaid i'm sure that amazon was above the legal limit in india
[3121.58 --> 3133.02]  but what i will say is that you know probably they weren't paid that much compared to amazon's balance
[3133.02 --> 3139.18]  sheet if you are interested in this uh there's a lot of coverage on these groups and it's like
[3139.18 --> 3146.68]  really bad uh so amazon clay i mean i'm sure they'd rather be working on this than you know
[3146.68 --> 3153.74]  training like gore algorithms or whatever which is another thing that they do amazon mechanical turk
[3153.74 --> 3159.28]  i'll jump over to my screen really quick oh no what is this they definitely don't just uh work for the
[3159.28 --> 3165.08]  you know amazon walk-in stores this is a service that you can get from amazon for a global on-demand
[3165.08 --> 3172.24]  24 7 workforce did you know you can hire people what the fuck does amazon mechanical turk mean
[3172.24 --> 3180.66]  i don't know am i missing something here i don't know no seriously though what does mechanical turk
[3180.66 --> 3188.98]  mean like like what what what is the what is the what is this branding m turk offers developers
[3188.98 --> 3194.38]  access to a diverse on-demand workforce through a flexible user interface uh or direct integration
[3194.38 --> 3201.94]  okay hold on a second can i just say that that use of the word diverse
[3201.94 --> 3211.48]  is quite possibly the most toxic that i have ever encountered ever i wonder if they count it in like
[3211.48 --> 3213.82]  in their like company diversification
[3213.82 --> 3223.80]  organizations can harness the power of crowdsourcing via m turk for a range of use cases such as
[3223.80 --> 3233.50]  micro work human insights and machine learning development so cool dude so amazon claimed that
[3233.50 --> 3239.02]  these workers were mostly tasked with improving its machine learning algorithms by annotating training
[3239.02 --> 3246.58]  footage yes um and that is totally a thing that doesn't mean that ai is just low wage workers from
[3246.58 --> 3251.52]  overseas uh okay apparently mechanical turk was a i i remember this because i looked it up when i first
[3251.52 --> 3256.68]  heard about this mechanical turk was a a chess playing robot a fake chess playing robot okay
[3256.68 --> 3266.06]  yeah i still probably wouldn't have gone with that oh yeah definitely not for sure cool yeah um anyway
[3266.06 --> 3270.86]  so that is that is a real thing it's a fraudulent chess machine that makes it actually genuinely
[3270.86 --> 3272.48]  funnier to me sorry
[3272.48 --> 3282.10]  the mechanical turk also known as the uh automaton chess player uh or simply the turk was a fraudulent
[3282.10 --> 3287.34]  chess playing machine constructed in 1770 which appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess
[3287.34 --> 3293.34]  against a human opponent for it for 84 years it was exhibited on various tours the machine survived and
[3293.34 --> 3298.48]  continued giving occasional exhibitions until 1854 when a fire swept through the museum where it was kept
[3298.48 --> 3302.38]  destroying the machine afterwards articles were published by a son of the machine's owner
[3302.38 --> 3305.64]  revealing its secrets to the public that it was an elaborate hoax
[3305.64 --> 3310.56]  imagine naming part of your company
[3310.56 --> 3323.34]  it's like ltt's new product distributed fraud
[3323.34 --> 3331.50]  and we'll we'll we'll use the diverse people
[3331.50 --> 3343.50]  i love how the third benefit of mechanical turk is reduced cost
[3343.50 --> 3348.46]  yeah they talk about how great the the team is and then they're like reduce cost
[3348.46 --> 3357.18]  okay so anyway hold on hold on okay so back to back to that just because you are using humans to
[3357.18 --> 3363.58]  validate the data that does not mean that it's not machine learning it can still be machine learning
[3363.58 --> 3370.22]  machine learning needs to be reinforced and you can't just have another machine reinforce the other
[3370.22 --> 3375.34]  machine you actually have to have humans go in and say okay no no that was that was a sandwich
[3375.34 --> 3381.58]  uh that was not a wrap right um okay sorry people people are yelling at me to read the next paragraph
[3381.58 --> 3388.70]  uh oh no so and i i skimmed it drac ryu says wait is this amazon's april fool's joke no this thing has
[3388.70 --> 3392.94]  been around for quite a while yeah um so yeah the part that i think they want me to read because people
[3392.94 --> 3395.82]  are saying the next paragraph other people saying the third paragraph i think it's the third one
[3395.82 --> 3401.66]  uh the turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate
[3401.66 --> 3407.74]  the machine so it's a it's a hidden person inside of a thing that you think is a machine so it got
[3407.74 --> 3414.14]  too real here yeah okay i think they're being like super literal or like this is an ai program that is
[3414.14 --> 3421.74]  actually a bunch of people the soilent is made out of people all right okay okay okay it's not quite
[3421.74 --> 3426.06]  that well i don't know anything about the like working conditions or whatever yeah but anyway this is
[3426.06 --> 3431.42]  this is 100 still machine learning the fact that 30 of them worked without human intervention is
[3431.66 --> 3436.06]  is something um but that's more like probably where they expected to be
[3437.10 --> 3444.54]  within a few months of launch yeah not where they expected to be eight years on from the launch uh
[3444.54 --> 3450.78]  according to a report by the information around 70 of transactions required the intervention intervention
[3450.78 --> 3456.94]  or assistance of an unseen off-site employee as of 2022 this apparently sometimes resulted in customers
[3456.94 --> 3461.34]  waiting hours before receiving a receipt that makes sense amazon will
[3461.34 --> 3466.78]  however continue with another cashierless feature that it's been experimenting with since 2020
[3466.78 --> 3472.38]  dash carts which are a combination of shopping cart slash self-checkout uh this is similar to another
[3472.38 --> 3478.78]  odd case discovered in december when a supposedly ai-powered drive-through presto automation which also needed
[3478.78 --> 3483.90]  uh overseas workers to step in 70 of the time according to a filing with the sec
[3483.90 --> 3493.90]  uh okay um so our discussion question is um what is the value of making it feel like something is totally
[3493.90 --> 3498.14]  automated even when it actually still takes a lot of human work to pull off uh one thing not mentioned
[3498.14 --> 3504.46]  in our notes here is apparently uh one of the other issues was that however whatever labor they were saving
[3504.46 --> 3513.50]  in cashiers um they were more than paying for in the army of people that had to go around and make sure that all of the products were perfectly faced
[3514.06 --> 3518.94]  so that the cameras could tell what people were taking off the shelves oh wow
[3518.94 --> 3527.02]  yeah you know what i mean i made a video about it because i legitimately thought it was really cool
[3527.58 --> 3535.50]  it seemed i i expressed at the time some doubts about the the viability of it i was like wow it's kind
[3535.50 --> 3542.14]  of amazing that they can do this because like uh i don't see like you know machine vision indicators of
[3542.14 --> 3547.90]  any there's they don't have like a dot code on it that you know whatever angle it can kind of catch a glimpse of
[3547.90 --> 3553.74]  and and and be sure like i i was i was really impressed but turns out i got bamboozled turns
[3553.74 --> 3561.74]  out mechanical turk worker number 47 282 was like i'm gonna charge this guy yeah x amount of dollars
[3562.38 --> 3570.30]  yeah while making a cent speaking of which mechanical turk fees the minimum fee is one cent per assignment
[3573.42 --> 3577.66]  okay well that tells you everything you need to know about how much people are being paid
[3578.78 --> 3585.42]  because unless they can do it'll be 700 assignments well hold on amazon's definitely taking something
[3585.90 --> 3590.46]  not just hold on hold on no no i know but that's not the math and that's also minimum fee i know that's
[3590.46 --> 3599.58]  not the math though the math is that unless a worker okay i see what you're doing can do 700 assignments
[3599.58 --> 3610.14]  per minute which would be our per hour rather which would work out to what 11 per uh 11 per second oh no
[3610.14 --> 3617.34]  hold on i'm not i can't math math me help me 700 let's let's say let's say 600 let's say we're aiming for
[3617.34 --> 3627.74]  10 10 an hour okay so they've got to do they've got to do what 100 every six minutes no a thousand
[3627.74 --> 3632.86]  every six a thousand every six minutes okay hold on one cent oh my god so that's a thousand things so
[3632.86 --> 3641.98]  they've got to do 100 every six minutes right yeah okay so 10 a second so about 10 a second
[3644.22 --> 3654.30]  is that right i don't know hold on i hate can time be metric please okay uh 100 we should we should
[3654.30 --> 3661.58]  divide it by 60 we should hire mechanical here we go so they have to do about 1.7 of those a second
[3661.58 --> 3666.94]  and that assumes they are being paid 10 an hour which is not a good wage and that assumes amazon takes
[3666.94 --> 3674.70]  nothing 100 every six minutes is 10 per second where'd you get 1.7 oh i missed a zero oh
[3676.86 --> 3682.46]  so every six minutes six minutes is how many seconds 100 every
[3684.30 --> 3695.74]  help me out ah i'm so tired i was walking you oh they tried metric time people hated it okay okay
[3695.74 --> 3700.30]  okay okay okay so hold on a second okay oh i said that wrong is that what i said i didn't mean to say
[3700.30 --> 3706.62]  that i meant one minute okay apparently i chat apparently can't do it either because they are all
[3706.62 --> 3713.42]  over the place why are we so bad at math okay all right i'm trying to do it fast we gotta slow down okay
[3713.42 --> 3720.30]  okay okay okay so it's one second or it's point uh one cent one interaction okay so it's a hundred
[3720.30 --> 3727.66]  interactions to a dollar it's a thousand interactions to ten dollars right so we've got a thousand
[3727.66 --> 3733.74]  interactions if we want to get paid ten dollars in an hour we divide a thousand by 60 that's the number
[3733.74 --> 3742.22]  per minute so that is 16.6 interactions per minute we divide it by 60 again that means we've got about
[3742.22 --> 3749.02]  four seconds per interaction i have done the math with a calculator this time four seconds per
[3749.02 --> 3754.38]  interaction and that assumes you're being paid only ten dollars an hour and that assumes that amazon is
[3754.38 --> 3763.10]  taking no cut what the isn't it 3.6 per second yeah i think so but i think you round it up yeah i round it
[3763.10 --> 3772.62]  okay what the heck is going on here has anyone worked for this i like anyone in chat
[3778.30 --> 3781.90]  man that is that is wild here's the mechanical turk worker page
[3781.90 --> 3792.70]  one dude said he did i've worked for it you need to pick jobs carefully okay what does that mean
[3793.26 --> 3799.42]  i think that oh because the minimum payment thing so if you select the job i don't know if that's how
[3799.42 --> 3804.30]  this works but if you select the job you might be able to select ones that are higher value i was also
[3804.30 --> 3809.50]  reading the page and there's like different qualifications so maybe if you have a higher qualification
[3809.50 --> 3814.70]  you can get higher value jobs and then you get paid more per job quite a few people in float
[3814.70 --> 3819.18]  plane chat are talking about this uh someone says m turk is pretty dead now but i used to do surveys
[3819.18 --> 3824.22]  for extra money in college uh someone else said i did some m turk in college never saw a cent
[3824.22 --> 3828.62]  uh someone said i knew someone who did work for m turk they said it was mostly just transcribing
[3828.62 --> 3835.90]  documents yes i did it for beer money in college it's not full gig stuff um interesting
[3835.90 --> 3844.06]  i've worked for less with a family business okay i mean yeah fair enough i guess um
[3846.62 --> 3850.70]  in theory says mad economist i think that's one cent ones are supposed to be
[3850.70 --> 3855.98]  click on the picture containing a bicycle i mean man for how long it takes me to solve a captcha sometimes
[3855.98 --> 3862.86]  yeah because like even that you'd have to do one every 3.6 seconds and consistently yeah like with no
[3862.86 --> 3873.18]  you better not blink or anything wow all right anyway um okay okay okay so trash cat says i've
[3873.74 --> 3881.10]  i've m turk work and yeah yeah you need to pick m carefully but generally minimum 10 cents per task
[3881.10 --> 3886.62]  in my experience okay so that's quite a bit better that's way better that's literally in order of
[3886.62 --> 3890.14]  magnitude are those more complicated tasks or is that click on the bike
[3893.66 --> 3897.74]  like i wonder how much would someone would have been paid to identify your order value from that
[3897.74 --> 3903.50]  store it must have been a lot higher i would hope so because you reviewing video footage
[3905.02 --> 3910.14]  can be very time consuming it's not just scrub through yeah we're good because they need to they
[3910.14 --> 3917.02]  need to be sure that's the whole idea because if they're training the machine vision model and they
[3917.02 --> 3924.30]  they feed it incorrect data that's that's a disaster like i mean obviously people are human they make
[3924.30 --> 3929.74]  mistakes from time to time especially if they're being paid you know pennies per interaction or you
[3929.74 --> 3936.86]  know whatever but the more of that noise that you feed into your model the worser it is going to get
[3936.86 --> 3943.34]  the more perfect the data you give it the better there's a very wide range of tasks apparently some
[3943.34 --> 3949.98]  will give five dollars for a 15 minute server i have worked for m turk and used it to find participants
[3949.98 --> 3956.14]  for studies interesting interesting all right well there you go m turk man i don't know how i'd never
[3956.14 --> 3960.54]  heard of this before because apparently it's a big deal valencry said you'd have to be very diligent
[3960.54 --> 3966.78]  and hardcore to make uh more than minimum wage the good jobs are taken quick that may be allocated
[3966.78 --> 3972.06]  within a couple minutes every few hours right because it's going to be like every in people in
[3972.06 --> 3980.38]  every time zone around the world just like sitting there waiting for a gig to show up crazy yeah okay
[3981.66 --> 3987.66]  i love twitch chat this all this mech turk stuff looks like outsourcing low-paying jobs to third world
[3987.66 --> 3995.10]  countries legally good job twitch gets there eventually and in this case i'm pretty sure
[3995.10 --> 3999.98]  they're all contractors they get there eventually luke yeah that's twitch chat they got it they got
[3999.98 --> 4005.42]  it they got it they figured it out the contractors thing makes it way worse here's a cookie um yeah the
[4005.42 --> 4009.26]  fact that they're contract yeah contractors because there can be really good things about being a
[4009.26 --> 4013.90]  contractor there can also be super bad things about being a contractor and there's a little bit of a
[4013.90 --> 4021.26]  pattern of certain modern like web companies that need actual like people physically doing their jobs
[4021.26 --> 4028.86]  using specifically contractors and paying very little it's not great uh you know what is great
[4028.86 --> 4034.54]  merch messages that's true you guys can interact with the show using a merch message don't do a super
[4034.54 --> 4040.22]  chat don't do a twitch bit the way to go is merch messages all you got to do is head over to lttstore.com
[4040.22 --> 4046.46]  and in the checkout you're gonna see a box anytime we're live where you can fill in a merch message
[4046.46 --> 4051.66]  uh do we have any merch updates that are in the doc here dan i don't uh i don't see anything here
[4053.98 --> 4065.10]  um oh oh oh wow yeah okay right we've got the uh limited edition shirt that we did for april fools
[4065.10 --> 4072.06]  yeah these are going to be printing and i believe the next week or so well going to printing in the
[4072.06 --> 4077.26]  next week or so and then they will yeah so it's going to be available oh until tomorrow this is
[4077.26 --> 4081.50]  this is available until tomorrow and then we're going to be hopefully printing them yeah over the
[4081.50 --> 4087.02]  next few weeks here so they'll go out there it's uh sarah did this up uh pretty quick it's uh it's a
[4087.02 --> 4093.82]  welcome welcome home shirt it's got the uh the old house got the old got the old lambo car which is uh
[4094.70 --> 4097.82]  you know it's going to be more of a reference to ploof's car soon i think with what we're
[4097.82 --> 4105.82]  planning to do to it while he's on vacation oh boy well i didn't want anyone to be jealous about the
[4105.82 --> 4113.82]  fact that he's getting free upgrades for his car oh yeah so it comes with a condition oh boy we get to
[4113.82 --> 4119.42]  decorate oh boy yeah it's gonna be good you should do a whole company paint party like last time yeah so when
[4119.42 --> 4125.10]  you leave a merch message right in the box in the checkout you will either have it show up down here
[4125.10 --> 4131.10]  you are going to get a reply from producer dan or it will be forwarded to someone internally and that
[4131.10 --> 4135.10]  person might be me and luke where we will address your merch message on the show we're going to show
[4135.10 --> 4139.66]  you guys how it works dan's going to pick us a couple curated merch messages but first i've got a
[4139.66 --> 4145.82]  quick poll for him to set up for you guys before we do those so that you guys can weigh in on what you
[4145.82 --> 4154.54]  want to see uh we're working on a new short short we're working on a new shirt and we want it to
[4154.54 --> 4161.74]  have like a like a name tag holder mechanism of some sort and we want your feedback on what you think is
[4161.74 --> 4168.86]  the best so option a is a little reinforced d ring so that's uh like a little a little metal ring so
[4168.86 --> 4173.10]  this is how it would sit all right there's option a luke are you gonna weigh in on this
[4173.10 --> 4179.50]  you know sorry i got linked something that was option b d ring with a little carabiner that can
[4179.50 --> 4184.94]  be tucked into the pocket when it's not in use kind of like that okay all right hold on so right
[4184.94 --> 4189.98]  right right this one has uh options so you can either hang it right off the d ring or you could
[4189.98 --> 4195.98]  hang it off the carabiner if you have to uh scan in on doors and stuff like that okay okay option c
[4195.98 --> 4207.66]  simple folded webbing loop and there we go and option d is d ring and carabiner base of pocket
[4209.10 --> 4215.82]  okay so those are our four options a b c and d is this a like tougher shirt or is this a dressier shirt
[4216.46 --> 4222.70]  it's meant to be an everyday everyday wear shirt so we understand that a lot of our audience are like
[4222.70 --> 4227.02]  techs yeah and they're gonna be crawling under a desk sometimes okay but they still gotta look good
[4227.02 --> 4232.22]  okay so it's like a little it's not you're not working in a mechanical shop but you're not just
[4232.22 --> 4238.38]  sitting at a desk it's a it's a it's um yeah it's a it's a little bit more it's an office office worker
[4238.38 --> 4243.90]  yeah and when i say worker i don't mean like you just have to sit at the computer you can wear it for
[4243.90 --> 4249.02]  that it's great for that too but we want it to be a little bit tougher than that uh all right so here
[4249.02 --> 4253.26]  we'll get our results i think in that case if i had to vote it would probably be are they saying b
[4253.26 --> 4257.10]  yeah i'm thinking i'm saying b as well because if you need to slide around on the ground being able
[4257.10 --> 4261.82]  to tuck the whole thing into the pocket really easily seems like a cool feature yeah that could
[4261.82 --> 4269.50]  be a bonus i like that a lot all right all right why don't we do a couple of merch messages sure first
[4269.50 --> 4275.10]  one here hey dynas duke and lan do you have any tips for someone struggling to stay disciplined
[4275.10 --> 4285.58]  whether it be for work or a hobby oh man i think nike said it best just do it yeah i i don't really
[4285.58 --> 4291.18]  know what else there is to say you you you have to decide what's important and you've got a you've
[4291.18 --> 4297.98]  got to commit no excuses there's there's a lot of different way like if you are incapable of doing
[4297.98 --> 4302.06]  that there are other things you can do we talked about this on last one show actually accountability
[4302.06 --> 4307.58]  type situation um yeah don't go to the gym by yourself it doesn't work you have to go with
[4307.58 --> 4313.02]  someone you have to there has to be a reason unless they're sick all the time yeah well i mean everyone
[4313.02 --> 4319.98]  i think i think it's fair to say that either everyone or at least almost everyone has better discipline
[4320.78 --> 4328.62]  planning ahead everyone knows that they should work out tomorrow everyone knows that they should
[4328.62 --> 4335.82]  go grocery shopping on the weekend and cook their meals but not everyone in the moment is going to
[4335.82 --> 4341.66]  feel like working out right now or going grocery shopping and cooking right now something i do
[4341.66 --> 4349.18]  specifically for both of those two things is like i'll pack my gym bag ahead of time yeah and like i'll
[4349.18 --> 4357.26]  i'll leave it like by the door so that it's like it's shaming you yes it's a reminder the food thing
[4357.26 --> 4363.66]  to prep it before you're hungry and then when it's that that meal comes up it's like oh you like
[4363.66 --> 4369.50]  could eat junk or you could go get some food or you could order delivery or whatever but actually the
[4369.50 --> 4376.14]  easiest option right now is eating the stuff you already prepped so like remove barriers of difficulty and
[4378.06 --> 4382.46]  i don't know if people are gonna like this but yeah increase levels of like you know have
[4382.46 --> 4387.74]  have a buddy that does the thing with you or your partner or whatever else um try to keep you
[4388.78 --> 4395.26]  keep you on it like have a workout buddy or or do meal prepping with someone else i don't know so i
[4395.82 --> 4402.22]  i i i never book badminton by myself i book it ahead of time because i know that you know i should go
[4402.22 --> 4409.90]  exercise and you know do stuff and then when it's time to go well there's a lot of obstacles to not going
[4409.90 --> 4414.62]  i'm gonna have to pay anyway because i signed up ahead of time and i'm not going to be there so
[4414.62 --> 4419.82]  they're going to be short people so the rotations are going to be off so i better go someone in
[4419.82 --> 4426.14]  full plane chat said we have no friends i actually don't agree that that's an excuse got him because
[4426.14 --> 4429.74]  not only is there a bunch of online communities where people are in the exact same boat and you
[4429.74 --> 4435.98]  could probably find an accountability buddy there but i've found if you go to the gym for example if we're
[4435.98 --> 4445.26]  just using that that one it's actually quite easy to make friends everyone there is there for the
[4445.26 --> 4452.54]  same reason yeah everybody and like uh like i made friends with this dude literally earlier this week
[4452.54 --> 4457.50]  because i saw he had lifting shoes and he finished a set and was just kind of standing there so i walked
[4457.50 --> 4463.18]  up to him and was like hey what's up he's like hey what's going on i was like i saw you have lifting
[4463.18 --> 4467.18]  shoes how do you like those and his whole he just lit up everybody if you ask him about like what
[4467.18 --> 4471.66]  they're doing or why they spent all this time researching it they spent all this money on it
[4471.66 --> 4476.38]  they're using it actively they've worked really hard no one in their life cares at all
[4478.22 --> 4484.54]  like not even a little bit wow you sound uh you sound mad it's i'm not mad are you mad bro it's just
[4484.54 --> 4491.82]  real because like he's always trying to tell me about how much he lifted i'm like doesn't even care a
[4491.82 --> 4498.22]  little bit is that a lot yeah that's the worst one that's the worst um but like sounds like a lot
[4498.22 --> 4506.30]  good job nobody cares gold star but but that other person at the gym yeah might actually care yeah so
[4506.30 --> 4512.14]  like it's it's quite easy to make friends with people there um if you if you work in an office try
[4512.14 --> 4517.58]  to find someone else like if they're if they're often going out for food every lunch you know try to
[4517.58 --> 4523.74]  make a pact with them like let's let's eat let's take our lunches together and eat together and eat
[4523.74 --> 4528.78]  stuff we brought home like brought from home like let's make this like a thing hold each other
[4528.78 --> 4533.58]  accountable let's try to save some money eat better stuff like that um and you don't even have to you
[4533.58 --> 4536.78]  don't even have to do it because you're like i want to lose weight you could do it because you
[4536.78 --> 4542.62]  want to just save some money you can make great things at home i don't know it's an option oh man
[4542.62 --> 4548.62]  common twitch l i actually hate you no super chats just buy something from me and i'll mention your
[4548.62 --> 4554.46]  comment so you'd rather just throw money at the screen than get something in return
[4556.70 --> 4565.10]  this is actually better how can you not see that yeah like i've i've had people at the gym well i'll
[4565.10 --> 4570.14]  ask them about like a certain movement that they're doing or whatever yeah it'll get they get so excited
[4570.14 --> 4575.18]  about it i'm like these they don't know who i am i'm just some random dude at the gym yeah they'll
[4575.18 --> 4579.74]  get so excited about it that i they end up talking to me about it like far longer than i had hoped they
[4579.74 --> 4584.14]  would i'm like ready to do my next set of whatever i'm doing like kind of hoping this person will stop
[4584.14 --> 4588.22]  talking but they're just like so stoked to talk about this thing that they're really interested in
[4588.22 --> 4592.54]  oh no they're still mad because they don't have to spend because they don't have to spend
[4592.54 --> 4598.54]  shipping costs on their donate then just buy a gift card and never use it yeah it's crazy there's
[4598.54 --> 4605.42]  loopholes it's it's a it's a it's nuts why do you want to give me money for nothing buy a backpack
[4605.42 --> 4613.26]  set the shipping address to like a homeless shelter boom sure you donated a backpack like oh man you
[4613.26 --> 4622.22]  guys are killing me here you're killing me you know what you know what band boom oh you lost your
[4622.22 --> 4627.50]  privileges it finally happened you lost your privileges all right look what you've done twitch
[4627.50 --> 4632.86]  no wait hold on no no that's not that's not bringing them back one person can't represent
[4632.86 --> 4637.50]  the hole there yeah never mind get wrecked
[4642.62 --> 4647.10]  uh all right two other things i'll add just really quickly you can you just can't shut up about this
[4647.10 --> 4652.14]  you are actually you are actually perfectly exemplifying the phenomenon you're talking about
[4652.14 --> 4657.42]  you get a gym person talking about the bloody gym yeah they can't shut up it is a problem it
[4657.42 --> 4662.46]  it's not possible literally go on forever i've done it to dan i'm living vicariously through luke
[4664.94 --> 4668.70]  is it it's not it's true though i think every time i have brought it up people are like
[4668.70 --> 4675.66]  well have you tried this because it's all it's all interesting i'm like no the research shows
[4675.66 --> 4684.22]  i've done did you hurt your shoulder well actually i didn't hurt my shoulder i read the papers on the
[4685.66 --> 4690.54]  full like partials are good for the uh um anyways no but like there's there's two things that i use as
[4690.54 --> 4695.98]  well one is try to do better than yesterday so if you're if you're like oh i don't want to take the
[4695.98 --> 4700.70]  stairs today i'm tired and then just let that thing in the back of your head go like you did it yesterday
[4700.70 --> 4705.74]  you did it yes you found a way yesterday and then it's like oh fine and then you go do it it's great
[4705.74 --> 4713.90]  um and then the i had another one well that's fine because it's time to do another merch message dan hit
[4713.90 --> 4722.94]  us okay sure uh let's see hello wan.dll prevents dill hello wan.dill uh i'll be starting my first home
[4722.94 --> 4728.54]  lab soon and would like some advice on security what's some ways i can keep my family safe while they use my
[4728.54 --> 4733.66]  services such as jellyfin well i mean if you are the one running the services i don't think there's
[4733.66 --> 4742.78]  much that you have to do to keep your family safe um they're a threat your family no this person oh
[4743.42 --> 4750.70]  um how do i protect them for myself yeah i mean okay i'm gonna get i'm gonna get flamed for this i i know
[4750.70 --> 4758.14]  i know it i know it realistically unless you are some kind of putting a jellyfin server
[4758.54 --> 4767.26]  and like having a port open on your router probably fine is it vulnerability yes it is
[4767.74 --> 4777.34]  are you running windows defender probably probably right it's probably fine um i mean i would say i
[4777.34 --> 4784.86]  would say you know a more realistic concern would be you know how do i manage the parental settings to
[4784.86 --> 4791.42]  ensure that young kids don't just have access to all the r-rated movies in my library like i i i would
[4791.42 --> 4799.90]  i would be more focused on the practical concerns just you know change your default passwords keep
[4799.90 --> 4805.34]  everything up to date you know the the basics the basics just make sure you're going in and making
[4805.34 --> 4811.58]  sure everything's chill uh check the logs for the devices that have connected to your network once in a
[4811.58 --> 4819.18]  a while use guest wi-fi guest wi-fi totally awesome uh if you want to be if you want to be a little bit
[4819.18 --> 4824.22]  if you want to be a little bit more careful you know have a really strong password on your main wi-fi
[4824.22 --> 4830.54]  like there's just you're asking this and you have iot devices running on your main network you're
[4830.54 --> 4834.38]  addressing the wrong problem i would also say yeah that's another one i mean we don't know that you do
[4834.38 --> 4841.58]  it's possible that you that you've got a lot of iot network yep my family was murdered by an open
[4841.58 --> 4843.18]  jellyfin port you monster
[4846.06 --> 4852.22]  i saw someone say last pass was hacked by a dev having plex on their system or whatever but that's
[4852.22 --> 4859.10]  almost like proving linus's point if you are a person that would be a very particularly interesting
[4859.10 --> 4865.66]  person to hack for whatever reason like a dev on a piece of security software that stores the passwords
[4865.66 --> 4872.06]  to like millions of people's accounts yeah um then yeah doing that type of stuff you're opening
[4872.06 --> 4876.46]  yourself and if you're that person then i shouldn't be advising you on cyber security anyway go figure
[4876.46 --> 4886.54]  it out yeah so there's that yeah uh all right got it um do you want to do another time oh we should
[4886.54 --> 4893.50]  do sponsors let's get sponsors we do three merch messages read the sign no did we do it though no

[5184.86 --> 5193.66]  what the heck what the heck what your car's broken into you i'm like yeah i'm watching dennis lumber away
[5193.66 --> 5199.18]  and then for some reason be so exhausted afterwards which i really you even asked him about it i was
[5199.18 --> 5203.50]  the whole time when he starts walking back and he's like huffing and puffing he literally went around
[5203.50 --> 5209.42]  the corner like yeah he didn't go very far i mean you saw him try to fight me right yeah buddy was gassed
[5210.46 --> 5215.18]  wait you were you were there in person so it didn't really make it into the edit because dennis edited it
[5215.18 --> 5220.30]  but he man the number of times he should have been disqualified from that man i was actually
[5220.30 --> 5225.90]  frustrated like not acting frustrated i was actually frustrated at like he was taking
[5226.78 --> 5231.58]  it didn't make any sense it wasn't fair he was taking extremely long breaks in fairness i got the
[5231.58 --> 5237.26]  same breaks yeah but i didn't need them you would have he was completely unable to fight and would have
[5237.26 --> 5243.66]  been disqualified yeah like he couldn't move yeah anyway so yeah he apparently hasn't been working on his
[5243.66 --> 5250.86]  cardio enough no so he he jogs around the corner and you just like speed walk after him well why why
[5250.86 --> 5255.42]  did you even go okay going that slowly okay so there's there's a number only caught him because
[5255.42 --> 5260.62]  he gave up because he was probably too tired from going around one corner there's a number of elements
[5260.62 --> 5272.38]  here okay one oops i keep absolutely nothing of value in my car nothing ever oh the backpack was chase's car
[5272.38 --> 5278.62]  okay yeah there was what was like spewing out of the car uh that was the contents of my glove box
[5278.62 --> 5286.30]  so basically there's tissues there's a power inverter there's some napkins there's some sanitary pads um
[5287.58 --> 5294.46]  there's like uh oh there's some extra hardware for my offset license plate mount there is nothing of
[5294.46 --> 5300.78]  value in my car ever like if i go into a restaurant you've seen me do this hey you bring the bag i bring
[5300.78 --> 5306.78]  my backpack in with me i leave i mean look at that stupid thing yeah if that's not a high profile target
[5306.78 --> 5311.58]  i don't know what is totally so i make sure there's nothing in it it's clean you look in the window you're
[5311.58 --> 5317.50]  like damn that's a clean car like nothing not not even crumbs of food there's nothing in there so that's
[5317.50 --> 5325.34]  number one what am i chasing him for nothing so you had you had that thought yeah i know there's nothing in my car
[5325.34 --> 5333.74]  but your your glass is broken number two that glass is not going to be unbroken by catching the guy
[5335.26 --> 5341.18]  i'm going to go through the exact same insurance rigmarole regardless of what happens with him
[5341.18 --> 5351.26]  so what difference does it make number three what if the guy's armed so okay i don't know what i'm gonna go
[5351.26 --> 5358.22]  i'm gonna go put my body and my life which i value by the way i'm gonna go put that in even if the
[5358.22 --> 5365.82]  even if the risk was one percent i'm gonna take a one percent chance to to have a violent encounter with someone
[5365.82 --> 5371.10]  over literally nothing of value so here's my camera and glass hold on i'm not done yet
[5371.58 --> 5376.78]  and glass that is already broken yeah the glass cannot be unbroken right through anything other
[5376.78 --> 5383.66]  than insurance and dealing with the hassle of taking it to the shop means finally number four
[5383.66 --> 5390.94]  i caught a glimpse of his face and i thought it might be dennis okay then it's actually at all because
[5390.94 --> 5395.18]  you thought it might because my thing is like if the first three or two which is fair fairly good
[5395.18 --> 5403.50]  reasoning why go anyways well i was noting you were putting chase yeah but because he was so slow he
[5403.50 --> 5409.66]  was also so no his speed varied it was hard to tell from the footage oh okay but he like booked it and
[5409.66 --> 5415.82]  then like slowed down it was like he wanted me to chase him so i was like now to be clear when i say
[5415.82 --> 5421.82]  i saw the face he kind of had his hood down i didn't know you wouldn't know for sure i didn't know it was
[5421.82 --> 5427.90]  dennis decent distance hood on so i didn't know and i told him i told him at the time i was like
[5428.78 --> 5433.58]  you got me because even though i i had all those thoughts and even though
[5433.58 --> 5440.14]  i thought and he actually found the frame where like yeah yeah yeah yeah where i was like
[5441.42 --> 5443.98]  he's like is this because i smile a little bit
[5445.74 --> 5454.54]  but then but then no no because but he got me because after that the the fake glass the fake glass
[5454.54 --> 5460.30]  was what convinced me so they rolled down the window and they made sugar glass and like put it so i've
[5460.30 --> 5466.38]  gone through that before i've actually had my car broken into multiple times and that feeling of kind
[5466.38 --> 5476.38]  of shock not not shock but like that feeling where it actually takes a second to process when you when
[5476.38 --> 5485.42]  you come into a building and it's been broken into everything is right except the things that are wrong
[5485.42 --> 5491.10]  and it can actually take a second so this one time i i parked my car outside of our garage overnight
[5491.10 --> 5495.26]  because there was like something in the way and i come out in the morning i sit down all the way in
[5495.26 --> 5500.30]  my driver's seat and the first thing that registered for me was actually that the seat was way back
[5502.46 --> 5509.26]  interesting i didn't actually see because i'm not in i'm not doing a pre-flight check on my car i'm not
[5509.26 --> 5515.18]  inspecting it i'm just getting in and driving and so i sat down into my seat and went well this isn't
[5515.18 --> 5521.98]  quite right yeah and then oh then i noticed yeah the shattered glass all over the passenger seat
[5522.62 --> 5531.18]  so like it it can it can take a a second for something to click and um and so what when i saw
[5531.18 --> 5539.98]  the shattered glass i actually like had that click moment i relived yeah yeah like my car's been broken
[5539.98 --> 5549.58]  into like the glass was the the thing that made me realize two times when my car had been broken into
[5549.58 --> 5558.22]  so what dennis did whether it was intentional or not yeah was he tapped into like a a an experience
[5558.22 --> 5564.22]  i've had before he tapped into a memory there's no way he knew that and recalled that emotional state
[5564.22 --> 5571.34]  that made me sort of be dismissive of my suspicions and kind of go my car's been broken into yeah so
[5571.34 --> 5576.94]  it wasn't the right color and like yeah some of it was like almost a yellowy because it's a sugar
[5576.94 --> 5583.26]  glass sugar yeah exactly but some of it was okay yep so and i wasn't looking that close you know maybe
[5583.26 --> 5589.18]  it got some gross water on it or whatever that's what did the discoloring yeah uh the video is on on
[5589.18 --> 5595.18]  floatplane so you can check it out um yeah the the only time my car has ever been broken into
[5595.18 --> 5604.38]  was there nice i don't know if you remember but i hold on so uh here's where they're here's where
[5604.38 --> 5611.26]  they're setting up uh i don't know this so that's when they were preparing the fake photo of chase's car
[5611.26 --> 5618.06]  oh here if you go if you go back you saw the orange backpack so he's editing it right there
[5618.06 --> 5622.22]  okay yeah because this is this is the fake he's trying to use ai to generate the glass then he
[5622.22 --> 5628.14]  ends up just doing it himself yeah so he um he he kind of it's a really good planted the seed in my
[5628.14 --> 5634.50]  mind of cars being broken into yeah which was really smart actually yeah i honestly at the time i was like
[5634.50 --> 5640.12]  why are you telling me this like cars can be broken into anywhere like i i'm really sure i guess
[5640.12 --> 5646.84]  um yeah so they had they got sammy to have me shoot an intro for something that he didn't need
[5646.84 --> 5651.96]  at all um and i was like yeah sure i'll shoot an intro for you i mean i like to be helpful so here
[5651.96 --> 5656.60]  he is making the broken glass see some of it is really nicely colored and then other bits are
[5657.16 --> 5663.40]  yellowy sugar glass yeah uh dennis told me by the way this might be in the video i'm not sure but he told
[5663.40 --> 5669.96]  me at the time that they carefully did not get any sugar glass in my car there's definitely some in there
[5669.96 --> 5674.44]  there was sugar glass in the car yeah there was sugar glass in the car they got cat they they
[5674.44 --> 5678.20]  burst one of the ketchup packets that was in my glove compartment oh and it got all over the
[5678.20 --> 5688.20]  passenger seat oh no it's like any time getting his car dirty and like dumped a bunch of my stuff onto
[5688.20 --> 5696.28]  the like wet dirty sidewalk and something like okay cool thank you for that like what anyway
[5696.28 --> 5704.04]  um yeah my my car got broken into at the old office and i had i had this the first nice piece
[5704.04 --> 5710.20]  of clothing i ever bought was this leather jacket from danier that was called the name of the jacket
[5710.20 --> 5717.48]  was luke nice and i didn't know that until i had picked it i was like this is perfect and then it
[5717.48 --> 5724.36]  was stolen out of my car um sag oh tynum wants to know scratched floor or dirty car more annoying
[5724.36 --> 5728.60]  definitely the scratch floor that is permanent yeah that's forever it's like a diamond
[5730.84 --> 5735.24]  diamond floor baby um yeah i might have to fight dennis again so we'll see
[5736.44 --> 5741.16]  budgerin asks why do you have ketchup in your glove box well where else would i keep it under the seat
[5741.16 --> 5746.12]  they don't give out ketchup packets by default at fast food restaurants anymore
[5747.96 --> 5754.12]  oh so it's for if you like forget to ask yeah okay then i have a ketchup packet and it turns out
[5754.12 --> 5759.24]  that if you keep them forever they do go bad in case anyone was wondering about that was that one
[5759.24 --> 5765.56]  bad no okay no no no no it's been replaced recently because now i know well some of them don't have
[5765.56 --> 5770.92]  expiry dates on them some do i just love that this is like an actual problem that you've sought
[5770.92 --> 5775.72]  a solution for found issues with the solution and improved upon and iterated that solution
[5776.28 --> 5777.88]  that's fantastic that's my whole life luke
[5781.16 --> 5783.24]  like what i'm gonna eat fries without ketchup
[5785.40 --> 5790.36]  this actually does sound like a particular linus problem that you would like seek out a solution for
[5790.36 --> 5795.48]  i fully would believe that oh yeah 100 and like man i i you need exactly
[5795.48 --> 5799.40]  the right amount of ketchup i take my fry and i like you've probably seen me do this yeah i've
[5799.40 --> 5805.24]  seen that i i put a strip of ketchup on the whole fry so the ratio is right yeah i've 100 seen that
[5805.72 --> 5811.48]  yep okay what are we doing two more topics three more topics somewhere around there
[5813.16 --> 5818.52]  oh dan wants to do merch messages all right sure dan i don't think we have that many this week
[5818.52 --> 5824.12]  we're a little out of order unfortunately oh i see yeah i've got some uh i've got some curated ones
[5824.12 --> 5828.44]  for you here all right hit me um i don't know what do you think about that top one
[5829.56 --> 5837.40]  i mean i haven't paid enough attention to it but luke might know and buddy spent like 500 so i guess we
[5837.40 --> 5845.40]  can uh whoa yeah i bought a screwdriver a backpack other more different screwdriver a stubby screwdriver
[5845.40 --> 5852.12]  a banana for scale a whole bunch of bits a sticker pack and a shaft extension uh so is this is this
[5852.12 --> 5857.56]  stop killing games that's right yeah and i don't know i've seen this guy for a while do you want me to
[5857.56 --> 5862.28]  do you want me to read this out yeah sure if you know what's going on yeah because i haven't i haven't
[5862.28 --> 5867.32]  this i haven't looked into this so yeah hi linus and luke what do you think of ross scott's call
[5867.32 --> 5872.84]  to action against ubisoft killing the crew do you think we have any chance of preventing future games from
[5872.84 --> 5878.36]  being destroyed um now i've followed this guy for a while yeah yeah so maybe dan can do this
[5878.36 --> 5883.32]  merch message because maybe maybe luke and i haven't paid attention to this i i had had it flagged for
[5883.32 --> 5889.80]  me and i've seen some community sentiment around this that is like that this is something we need to be
[5889.80 --> 5895.24]  supporting but i hadn't had a chance this week to dig into it yeah i've seen his videos but i i'm not
[5895.24 --> 5900.52]  up to date on this yeah he had some really good thoughts i think i hope it was him ages ago about
[5900.52 --> 5906.60]  always online games that are single player that the companies go oh well you know we can't afford
[5906.60 --> 5911.56]  the server upkeep anymore and so the game that you have paid for you are now no longer able to play
[5911.56 --> 5918.12]  and so a lot of uh a lot of people will take these servers and host them themselves i know there's a
[5918.12 --> 5923.88]  bunch of different games that kind of have community hosted servers and there's no more dedicated
[5923.88 --> 5930.28]  you know first party ones anymore um so i think this is probably a call towards that right a game
[5930.28 --> 5936.60]  that linus and i enjoyed to play every now and then is like that um subcom i don't remember what's
[5936.60 --> 5941.56]  supreme commander forged alliance forged alliance yeah wait forged alliance forever is the uh the
[5941.56 --> 5949.56]  community takeover of the game that was allowed to happen after gas-powered games went yeah yeah but
[5949.56 --> 5954.36]  was it was it gas powered that let them do it like some some there was like a i forget which party
[5954.36 --> 5959.80]  ultimately uh enabled uh enabled that but it's pretty cool and recently i think it's city of
[5959.80 --> 5968.12]  heroes there's unfortunately a lot um and i think the worst offender is probably single player games
[5968.12 --> 5972.92]  sorry forged alliance forever was a an example of a good thing yeah we're currently trying to talk about
[5972.92 --> 5978.52]  good things yeah yeah i think i think it was city of heroes that recently just publicly was like yeah
[5978.52 --> 5983.48]  people can host their own servers and iterate on the game and everything and good luck i don't remember
[5983.48 --> 5990.52]  what it was i might be seeing the wrong one yeah but there are some few good examples there are good
[5990.52 --> 5995.48]  examples and i think those are probably the outliers in the situation mostly bad ones it's mostly like
[5995.48 --> 6002.28]  this yeah um right and and it's very frustrating especially because there's still an active community
[6002.28 --> 6010.36]  even though they may be small but they're still active well yeah the this blurb here says um the
[6010.36 --> 6014.60]  video game the crew this is on stop killing games.com this blurb says the video game the
[6014.60 --> 6020.76]  crew published by ubisoft was recently destroyed for all players and had a player base of at least 12
[6020.76 --> 6028.12]  million people that's an interesting number that's not a small i'm assuming that was at one point in
[6028.12 --> 6032.60]  time i can't imagine there's that many people playing the crew right now yeah there's no way they'd be
[6032.60 --> 6037.64]  shutting it down but i mean you might be surprised yeah i don't know due to the game's size and france's
[6037.64 --> 6042.60]  strong consumer protection laws this represents one of the best opportunities to hold a publisher
[6042.60 --> 6049.32]  accountable for this action we are six if we are successful in charges being pressed against ubisoft
[6049.32 --> 6054.04]  this will have a ripple effect on the video games industry to prevent publishers from destroying more
[6054.04 --> 6060.36]  games and then there's like buttons to click where you can take action and in various countries and
[6060.36 --> 6065.16]  stuff like that yeah yeah that's right i watched his video on the crew about a month ago it came out
[6065.16 --> 6072.28]  dead game news is this series yeah yeah it's brutal we talk about on wancho all the time um this seems
[6072.28 --> 6078.68]  like a good thing to jump on the train for so yeah i mean look i'll say this is not a creator that i'm
[6078.68 --> 6085.32]  person i'm not personally acquainted with so i don't yeah um but you know what i do know is i agree with
[6085.32 --> 6091.96]  the cause and if all you're being asked to do is sign a petition that says that you don't think this is
[6091.96 --> 6096.60]  okay then i think that's something that i can wholeheartedly recommend without like i already
[6096.60 --> 6103.24]  said doing any due diligence on this um i intend to sign the petition once the show is over and i i can
[6103.24 --> 6109.08]  do that um yeah i do think please don't right now yeah no i'm busy right now i i do think that these
[6109.08 --> 6115.32]  companies need to be held accountable and i think that if there are no monetary consequences not only is
[6115.32 --> 6121.24]  nothing ever going to change it is going to get so much worse oh yeah because a lot of especially
[6121.24 --> 6128.36]  younger consumers don't even understand what they've lost yet even the games that do still exist
[6129.32 --> 6135.40]  the the the the modes the ways of playing them that have changed as games as a service evolve
[6135.96 --> 6142.04]  are gone i mean think back to think back to what it was like when you finally quit wow and how badly you
[6142.04 --> 6149.64]  wanted to just play classic wow again and blizzard finally did it and then my understanding is they
[6149.64 --> 6154.76]  kind of bunged it up because didn't they start like updating it again yeah and like you you already
[6154.76 --> 6160.92]  can't actually play classic again now nice because it progressed through the expansions so it's already
[6162.28 --> 6165.16]  so what they need to do is they just need to do like a like a wipe system
[6166.36 --> 6171.00]  yeah there are some there are other games that do that like if i remember correctly everquest
[6171.00 --> 6178.20]  has a very similar like you can play original like uh 1999 everquest or whatever it was 2001 i don't
[6178.20 --> 6184.20]  remember maybe runescape was 1999 whatever um and they they wipe frequently and most of the active
[6184.20 --> 6188.52]  players as far as my understanding goes for the everquest one are on the servers that are fresh
[6188.52 --> 6192.28]  because people want to play fresh experiences where everyone's starting back at scratch all that type of
[6192.28 --> 6198.60]  stuff um but yeah i think the runescape speaking of runescape didn't like runescape creator just
[6198.60 --> 6205.72]  make a new game actually you can still play classic era okay yeah uh i think i forgot that was a thing
[6206.44 --> 6214.04]  oh okay well there you go i don't know older school runescape yeah it's classic era wiping though i don't
[6214.04 --> 6221.72]  think it's wiping they're just permanent servers right i don't know whatever either way um okay
[6221.72 --> 6230.44]  next up yep hey lld is there a reason why 256 characters is the default max path on ndfs still we
[6230.44 --> 6235.96]  run into this on my work ndfs server and it's infuriating especially because some apps don't
[6235.96 --> 6246.44]  serve proper errors man that's a question for a windows developer um if i had to guess i would say
[6246.44 --> 6256.36]  it's because it hasn't been a priority to fix it i mean there's so so many things in windows or gmail or
[6256.36 --> 6264.12]  basically anything you use that um just haven't been updated because it's not the most important
[6264.12 --> 6270.60]  thing i can work on today right and i mean we run into that all the time stuff that theoretically is a
[6270.60 --> 6278.04]  quick bug fix but in practice is just never the thing that's on fire today i've talked about that
[6278.04 --> 6286.04]  to a few people here where it's like i i wouldn't worry so much about your job security in the sense
[6286.04 --> 6292.04]  of you running out of work to do yeah there is effectively an infinity list of tasks that we could
[6292.04 --> 6297.56]  do yeah yeah don't stress the the biggest problem is figuring out what item on this infinity list is the
[6297.56 --> 6302.12]  thing that we should work on right now and sometimes it can be frustrating because someone can be really
[6302.12 --> 6309.40]  passionate about one of the things on the list yeah but there's this other thing that maybe it has to
[6309.40 --> 6316.84]  be done for some and you might not fully understand why that other thing is more important but it is
[6316.84 --> 6323.64]  yeah at least we strongly believe it is people make mistakes we get things wrong uh this is a suggestion
[6323.64 --> 6328.44]  quantum rand in floatplane chat says uh try asking dave's garage on youtube if there's anyone who is
[6328.44 --> 6338.44]  likely to both a no and b dish i would say that it would be dave's garage um also apparently this is
[6338.44 --> 6345.72]  according to positron there is a uh registry edit where you can go in and you can change it to a higher
[6345.72 --> 6353.00]  limit uh you have to change uh files to set concurrent control set control file system long paths enabled
[6353.00 --> 6360.12]  uh and that changes the limit according to matthew oh to 4096 characters which ought to be enough for
[6360.12 --> 6367.56]  anyone that's a reference which bill gates apparently never said anyway it doesn't matter yeah okay
[6369.56 --> 6373.32]  there's um there's some reason why i had to do that in the past i don't remember what it was
[6373.32 --> 6378.36]  i think it was like development file paths that were just getting ridiculous developers developers
[6378.36 --> 6381.80]  developers developers developers developers developers developers
[6381.80 --> 6389.40]  got to go the nested folders for days yeah all right dan sorry uh let's see uh good evening dlo
[6389.40 --> 6396.60]  question for you three or whoever answers ivory towers are very prolific in manufacturing companies
[6396.60 --> 6404.92]  dod subcontractors included uh how do we better guard against detached decisions i don't know it's tough
[6404.92 --> 6413.24]  because even making a conscious effort to talk to people and work in the trenches at this company as
[6413.24 --> 6420.52]  we've grown it hasn't always been easy to fully understand the daily challenges that people have uh we had
[6420.52 --> 6427.08]  someone raise a concern so i was frustrated on a shoot recently when a prop that was integral to the
[6427.08 --> 6435.48]  intro was not sourced um well a we we had it at one point but at some point we lost it and then when
[6435.48 --> 6444.04]  we realized we lost it we didn't source a new one and i i i i landed on set and i was like whoa i can't arrive
[6444.04 --> 6450.28]  on set and like the intro doesn't work because the prop i need for the intro isn't here we don't have one
[6450.28 --> 6457.72]  this was so preventable and the conversation that ultimately came out of out of that was hey we don't
[6457.72 --> 6466.68]  have a process for just anyone making a petty cash decision and then begging for forgiveness later
[6466.68 --> 6473.32]  there just isn't a means for it and it was a funny thing for me to think about because even before i
[6473.96 --> 6478.52]  ran my own company or whatever that was a hundred percent something that i just did
[6478.52 --> 6487.40]  if something was like 50 bucks and i knew that i could defend it to the ceo i would just spend the
[6487.40 --> 6493.56]  50 and worry about it later but uh that is that is not a recommendation
[6495.80 --> 6502.28]  if there if there's for real though right like i got away with being a bit of a maverick
[6502.28 --> 6508.36]  but that's not that's that's not necessarily good for your career you now would deal with
[6508.36 --> 6516.28]  managing you back then oh god it would actually be like quite the clash i would be very frustrated
[6516.28 --> 6523.24]  both of me would be very frustrated always yeah anyway the point is what came out of that was that
[6523.24 --> 6531.88]  hey we don't have a formalized like one of uh ceo taren's favorite words is explicit we don't have a
[6531.88 --> 6539.64]  formalized process that gives people explicit permission to make a decision like that um a lot
[6539.64 --> 6546.28]  of people just do it anyway so especially people who have been around since the old days and who have
[6546.28 --> 6551.32]  been doing it for years but especially new people don't know they don't realize they come from other
[6551.32 --> 6557.08]  companies where where spending 20 bucks that you weren't allowed to spend could literally mean getting
[6557.08 --> 6563.40]  addressing down right like i and that's so that's so foreign to me like i that doesn't make sense in
[6563.40 --> 6568.44]  my world because i never worked in that environment and i'm not going to foster that environment here
[6568.44 --> 6575.40]  but that's quite inefficient yeah i came across my supposed uh approval limit i don't remember when
[6575.40 --> 6582.04]  this was like a few months ago or something and just erupted with laughter i was like oh
[6582.04 --> 6591.72]  i have approved things wildly beyond this many times like yeah that's actually bad though i didn't
[6591.72 --> 6596.04]  know no one told me oh my god because the approval limits were set up when floatplane was completely
[6596.04 --> 6602.20]  separate so it was genuinely not communicated to me at that time so like our cloudflare contract
[6602.20 --> 6609.00]  which is like enormous certain other ones i fought for the best genuinely fought for like the best
[6609.00 --> 6613.72]  thing we could get in a lot of these occasions and that's the thing though is which i think is why
[6613.72 --> 6619.64]  i didn't get in trouble in good faith if you are doing the best thing for the company and you can
[6619.64 --> 6626.28]  defend it like that's that's honestly the the guiding star that i lived by was could i argue this and
[6626.28 --> 6631.80]  win yeah and if i can argue it and win then the conversation's over and
[6631.80 --> 6643.24]  this is not advice and realistically the trust level goes up it can however if you if you just
[6643.24 --> 6649.40]  do what you think is right and it turns out that either you weren't right or your boss is an idiot
[6649.40 --> 6653.64]  and doesn't understand you were right it could be very harmful to your career prospects it could
[6653.64 --> 6658.52]  even get you fired depending on what's going on so like it's it's genuinely not advice yeah and that
[6658.52 --> 6665.24]  and uh my my mom loves to loves to phrase things this way especially around like traffic lessons
[6665.24 --> 6670.60]  for the kids uh she goes it doesn't matter if you're in a crosswalk it doesn't matter if the
[6670.60 --> 6677.72]  light is red it doesn't matter if you see the little walkie man you check you make sure they are actually
[6677.72 --> 6687.64]  breaking because sure you can you can be right and dead but you'll be dead right yeah yeah
[6687.64 --> 6693.80]  um and and i think it's those are those are words to live by and everything you know walking
[6693.80 --> 6698.52]  across the street uh career relationship it doesn't matter if you're right if you get killed in the
[6698.52 --> 6706.92]  process yeah xg ford says boss's idiot is the issue that's fair enough uh data fricking says got
[6706.92 --> 6711.88]  hit in a crosswalk yeah 100 yep yep arbiter case says i was hit by a car and i was on a crosswalk
[6711.88 --> 6720.68]  had the right of way 100 man i uh i i didn't take a course until i learned to ride a motorcycle and
[6720.68 --> 6726.76]  what i found out was i just kind of naturally do a lot of defensive driving things but one of them
[6726.76 --> 6735.88]  is that i do not start moving when a light turns green no way scan i am making sure i am making damn
[6735.88 --> 6742.36]  good and sure that the cars on both side are decelerating with enough space to not enter the
[6742.36 --> 6747.24]  intersection every single time i've been honked at because i've been like i have not determined that
[6747.24 --> 6754.04]  it is safe to proceed yet and i'm just sitting there um i had a i i've a very clean driving record
[6754.04 --> 6760.44]  i've never hit anything i've never been hit i've everything's nice i had a scare the other day it was
[6760.44 --> 6770.44]  raining really really hard yeah visibility was not very good i'm turning in a uh it's like off a seldom
[6770.44 --> 6776.76]  used street into a parking lot there's someone that comes out from behind my pillar like i couldn't see
[6776.76 --> 6782.60]  them and they're wearing all black visibility is terrible it's raining and i see them come to a stop
[6782.60 --> 6788.20]  and i slam the car into a stop at the same time and it's like possible that that could have been bad
[6788.20 --> 6793.88]  and i was just like oh man um and like because like it doesn't matter they're wearing all black
[6793.88 --> 6799.24]  it doesn't matter that it's raining oh yeah it's still your fault yeah uh ceo taren ceo taren has uh
[6799.24 --> 6805.00]  had a really good uh trick that uh i've used since i saw him do it uh whenever he goes around a blind
[6805.00 --> 6811.08]  corner um he'll flash his beams or hunk like if it's a bad blind corner and i saw him do this in a
[6811.08 --> 6817.96]  parkade was where where it like was where it first came up to give you some idea like how blind this
[6817.96 --> 6823.80]  corner needs to be don't don't honk your horn every time you turn your car obviously uh but like um
[6824.76 --> 6830.28]  that's a good one yeah in uh there's a there's a part there's a parking lot that i often pull into
[6830.28 --> 6838.92]  that has an uncontrolled t intersection where there is not a lot of traffic and you may have even seen
[6838.92 --> 6845.24]  me do this but if it's nighttime i flash my beams as i'm going toward that intersection to make sure that's
[6845.24 --> 6852.44]  it's obvious someone is coming you never you never know like people people get hit by trains
[6852.44 --> 6858.68]  and that's not because they're dumb it's well sometimes it is but it's often not because
[6858.68 --> 6864.84]  they're dumb it's because it's not always obvious unless there is like motion there so there has to
[6864.84 --> 6871.64]  be something to break us out of our out of our zone super zoned out sometimes yeah exactly exactly yeah i i
[6871.64 --> 6876.68]  have caught myself being really aggressive about like physically moving myself so that i can check
[6876.68 --> 6880.36]  behind pillars whenever i'm going around corners i've always been really good about checking for bikes
[6881.40 --> 6885.40]  all that other times type of stuff but i i realized in that moment that i don't think i've been super
[6885.40 --> 6891.32]  good about making sure there isn't a thin pedestrian behind the pillar you know it's something i've noticed
[6891.32 --> 6898.52]  too as i'm getting older shoulder checking is more work it's like actually harder now that's
[6898.52 --> 6904.20]  interesting like i really thought about that i used to be i used to be like skinnier and just you
[6904.20 --> 6909.56]  know just generally wire here like i didn't take up as much space uh like i've probably since i since
[6909.56 --> 6920.04]  i worked at ncix i've probably put on about 25 pounds which at for five six is like a fair bit i'm just
[6920.04 --> 6926.04]  like generally stiffer like i'm just always like sore from working out in your defense i think a lot of it's
[6926.04 --> 6932.68]  been muscle yeah but i just mean like like i was just like you know just like moving around in a
[6932.68 --> 6938.36]  seat yeah it was easier it does get harder yeah um and like you know you know my neck's different
[6938.36 --> 6942.44]  than it used to be into stuff so so it's it's something that i i realized a little while ago and
[6942.44 --> 6946.36]  i was like okay i need to make a very conscious effort because i i was the kind of person who would
[6946.36 --> 6952.68]  like make sure i've got nothing in front of me and like look behind me like not a peripheral vision
[6952.68 --> 6959.88]  shoulder checker i was like anything back there let's go yeah um but yeah just i just my my
[6959.88 --> 6965.08]  cheapness doesn't want my insurance rate to go up so i don't want to hit anything that is not the
[6965.08 --> 6969.24]  reason and i care about everyone being perfectly safe all the time
[6972.20 --> 6974.44]  can you at least try to convince me
[6974.44 --> 6984.60]  hey man they both count what a dick at least your car is already red all right dan what are we
[6984.60 --> 6993.80]  supposed to be doing that's a good point my leather is white do you know how do you know what a bad
[6993.80 --> 6998.60]  decision that was
[7001.32 --> 7007.16]  yeah you can keep doing topics if you want even further and the incontinence sets in oh i mean
[7007.16 --> 7014.76]  there's that too oh chipotle i mean we saw dan leaking in the badminton center tour oh yeah that's bad
[7014.76 --> 7023.48]  what there was like a puddle on the floor and i made an offhand joke about dan peeing himself or
[7023.48 --> 7027.72]  something or like i was just getting over food poisoning something and he goes and like what did
[7027.72 --> 7032.44]  you do you like crouched over it or something i don't remember i actually can't remember you did
[7032.44 --> 7037.48]  something everything here is just a fever dream it's like dan the joke you've taken the you've taken
[7037.48 --> 7044.28]  the joke was awful and uncomfortable editors to cut back yeah the editors can find the line
[7046.84 --> 7053.56]  yeah who has more power in this company than the editors for real though oh they can make or break
[7053.56 --> 7060.12]  you yeah they are the most important they absolutely can that's yeah that's something ed taught me early
[7060.12 --> 7066.20]  on not not in like by doing it by making me look terrible yeah because you were all like never piss
[7066.20 --> 7072.52]  off your it admin and he was like never piss off your head because he excuse me when he first joined
[7072.52 --> 7077.72]  he kept saying like it's all in the edit it's all in the edit and i was like it's all in the way and
[7077.72 --> 7083.48]  then i was like oh yeah we'd film something i'd be like this was trash no one's ever going to want
[7083.48 --> 7088.36]  to watch this and it comes out of the edit i'm like wow it's pretty good it's pretty watchable okay
[7088.36 --> 7095.08]  like a couple frames can make you seem like a non-funny like bumbling idiot yeah or sharp-witted and
[7095.08 --> 7100.44]  hilarious it's actually like frames even just adding yeah exactly a little bit onto the end
[7100.44 --> 7105.40]  of every clip so you just seem like you're kind of nothing lands and there's like awkward pauses
[7105.40 --> 7111.56]  and then you turn back and it's great or the whole roast video that had no laughter in it it's amazing
[7113.16 --> 7119.24]  to be clear it didn't need a laugh track people were losing it um but we didn't have the we didn't
[7119.24 --> 7125.40]  have the audience mic'd yeah ironically one of the first productions we ever did where we hired
[7125.40 --> 7131.72]  a professional av company to come in and run the production for us i had we had so many comments
[7131.72 --> 7140.12]  on that video you know these dummies never get it right it wasn't even us oh come on i mean we do make
[7140.12 --> 7147.64]  mistakes absolutely but if i'm gonna own mistakes i'd like for them to at least be our mistakes it's got six
[7147.64 --> 7153.64]  million views yeah it did okay it's really funny i've gone back and watched it a couple times i'm
[7153.64 --> 7158.12]  sure i've said this a bunch of times but i i i'm guessing on i on average i watch it like once a
[7158.12 --> 7164.76]  year yeah it's so funny i always forget at least a good chunk of it yeah dennis and ivan are so good
[7164.76 --> 7167.64]  oh man ivan did not hold back no
[7167.64 --> 7178.36]  oh that was great anyways we're doing topics let's do it we have a lot of topics today you've
[7178.36 --> 7185.80]  got about 40 minutes till after dark intel's mega fab possibly haunted intel's planned german mega fab
[7185.80 --> 7190.52]  has run into a potential snag in that the currently empty field where it's supposed to be built
[7191.16 --> 7198.76]  is also the site of several neolithic burial mounds estimated to be about 6 000 years old
[7199.40 --> 7204.84]  archaeology archaeologists have been examining the area since last year and noticed that a small hill
[7204.84 --> 7212.12]  in the industrial park was actually an ancient grave complex the site contains multiple graves including
[7212.12 --> 7218.28]  a chariot burial where sacrificed cattle were buried alongside a human being in formation that was meant
[7218.28 --> 7223.64]  to imitate a driver and cart pulled by the animals archaeologists will be working to preserve the
[7223.64 --> 7228.12]  discovery though intel is still expected to begin construction on schedule can you imagine being
[7228.12 --> 7234.68]  that archaeologist like usually i would imagine you're kind of working you know within budget at a
[7234.68 --> 7239.72]  pace that is reasonable and it's going to be like pat gelson you're breathing down your neck can we build
[7239.72 --> 7245.96]  yet there are billions of dollars any idea how much our stock just crashed based on how our fab
[7245.96 --> 7251.96]  business is looking right now i have some investors to please can we build yet it would be kind of
[7251.96 --> 7257.96]  sick if they did like a statue of the the chariot setup to be clear to be clear i still like intel
[7257.96 --> 7263.16]  in the long term but i made it very very clear not investment advice never investment advice not investment
[7263.16 --> 7272.28]  advice when i said that that it was a long-term play long term play like geopolitical at some point
[7272.28 --> 7278.68]  something might happen to tsmc and intel's fab business might do really good long-term play okay
[7279.32 --> 7288.52]  that's all uh what else we got google deletes incognito data yeah google has agreed to delete all data
[7288.52 --> 7295.72]  collected while users were browsing in incognito mode in order to avoid a potential five billion dollar fine
[7295.72 --> 7301.80]  for failing to adequately inform users that google was still tracking them google initially argued that its
[7301.80 --> 7308.60]  incognito mode landing message that users activity might still be visible to websites that they visit
[7308.60 --> 7314.04]  was was a sufficient warning but gave up quickly after a judge decided that this language was
[7314.04 --> 7320.12]  obviously misleading meanwhile google is testing device bound session credentials
[7321.64 --> 7327.88]  great a way of cryptographically tying session credentials to a specific device in order to prevent bad
[7327.88 --> 7333.40]  actors from accessing sensitive accounts by stealing and cloning session credentials discussion question
[7333.40 --> 7338.76]  is this enough what about all the money they made with this data while they had it that's a good point
[7340.84 --> 7345.16]  that is a good point i have no idea i think this should decrease their fine i don't think it should
[7345.16 --> 7351.40]  eliminate the fine yeah i like they did the bad thing it's not like you can be like oh yeah i killed that guy but
[7351.40 --> 7357.64]  like look look how alive he is um hello welcome to the wan show exactly you could like that's not how that
[7357.64 --> 7359.88]  works you can't un-crime so
[7364.44 --> 7368.28]  for something like this in my opinion they should figure out how much they profited off of them
[7368.28 --> 7373.16]  and that should be the fine if they stop doing it impossible though how could you possibly quantify
[7373.16 --> 7377.80]  that i agree i mean but that's how i would like it google might have their own internal metrics for how much
[7377.80 --> 7383.16]  they think the data is worth but you're basically you're just trusting google yeah to tell it to
[7383.16 --> 7388.36]  tell you what it was worth yeah there's we can take google's they should absolutely i can't take credit
[7388.36 --> 7394.28]  for that joke that's uh that's g-dub and float plane chat heck yeah it should um there should absolutely
[7394.28 --> 7400.52]  still be a fine this is this is getting off with nothing essentially they did a crime until they got caught
[7400.52 --> 7406.36]  and then didn't get in trouble for it yeah it's like you've been robbing banks for a long time yeah it's
[7406.36 --> 7411.00]  like you're cheating on your you're cheating on your spouse for 10 years and she catches you and
[7411.00 --> 7417.80]  you're like okay well i will stop i will not cheat anymore in this specific way and then she's like
[7417.80 --> 7424.76]  great yeah well no harm no foul then like what that's not how this works that's not anything works
[7425.80 --> 7433.24]  apparently anyways one that i want to talk about yeah discord wants you to make your friends watch ads
[7433.24 --> 7440.20]  nice this week discord will be expanding its quest program which i didn't even know exists which sends
[7440.20 --> 7446.84]  notifications to some users with an offer of in-game rewards if they play certain games and stream them
[7446.84 --> 7453.00]  to their friends these streams will have ads that live in the bottom left uh bottom left hand corner i
[7453.00 --> 7458.76]  guess of the screen these ads will be targeted based on information collected by discord though users can
[7458.76 --> 7463.00]  opt out both of this data collection and all notifications related to quests
[7467.48 --> 7475.00]  i have been wondering this whole time how streaming on discord makes any sense for discord at all and this
[7475.88 --> 7479.80]  really didn't help me understand do tell
[7479.80 --> 7494.76]  i don't think so so it's going through discord i mean so all the bandwidth of streams is going through discord
[7496.60 --> 7504.76]  and they're going to offset it with this i mean this is better than nothing but i just i just
[7504.76 --> 7510.44]  i mean honestly luke it must be it must be going through their infra because otherwise why would
[7510.44 --> 7516.20]  they limit the quality so hard yeah i mean that's a good point like it could be just you know to make
[7516.20 --> 7519.64]  you pay for nitro like you can make that ability reasons because some people's computers won't be
[7519.64 --> 7525.80]  able to do it but realistically i i doubt it because when when discord was in hey we're just vc funded and
[7525.80 --> 7529.88]  don't need to make any money let's go mode they they made everything as great as they possibly could
[7529.88 --> 7538.12]  like i think i i i actually even from a even from a user safety standpoint i kind of feel like they
[7538.12 --> 7543.48]  would have to have it go through their infra yeah because there are public servers that people stream in
[7543.48 --> 7550.28]  for sure yeah yeah and like and they could potentially be liable for what someone sent to
[7550.28 --> 7555.96]  someone else on the platform like they'd have to have some kind of record of that um apparently it is
[7555.96 --> 7563.08]  direct oh discord streams usually go through stun turn servers okay hold on hold on we're getting some
[7563.08 --> 7571.40]  no we're getting some uh conflicting information in the floatplane chat so i'm not a hundred percent
[7571.40 --> 7579.08]  sure hold on people are saying yeah google did not commit a crime um just okay technically
[7579.08 --> 7584.68]  probably not but stealing telling you you're not telling someone you're not going to take their personal
[7584.68 --> 7591.72]  information and then taking it is that not a crime it might not technically be a crime but it's certainly not nice
[7591.72 --> 7600.60]  and it should be that's that's where i'll that's where i'll leave that sure we if it isn't it should be none of this is legal advice
[7600.60 --> 7602.60]  yep hey that thing he said yeah
[7602.60 --> 7611.32]  if it's peer-to-peer i've never looked into this because like i don't care that much it just seems
[7611.32 --> 7619.64]  a little weird to me if it's peer-to-peer i totally get it sounds good um yeah routing it through their
[7619.64 --> 7625.64]  servers yeah yeah whatever um but if it's peer-to-peer then sure okay they found a cool way to monetize it
[7625.64 --> 7631.32]  whatever you don't have to do the quests you can opt out of the data collection stuff seems all fine to
[7631.32 --> 7639.32]  me um how it all goes live yeah i don't have time to read this right now but if if they are doing like
[7639.32 --> 7644.36]  transcoding or anything for it it makes no sense to me at all if it's directly peer-to-peer then sure
[7644.36 --> 7649.56]  okay makes sense go live streams are transmitted to discord's back end and then routed to viewers
[7649.56 --> 7653.88]  this hides the ip addresses between users on the call and allows the service to control where the
[7653.88 --> 7659.88]  data is routed for example the service will only relay video to a participant on the call if they
[7659.88 --> 7666.12]  are watching it the go live stream is constrained by how much data can go through the network because
[7666.12 --> 7669.96]  the stream needs to be watchable for every viewer the streamer will not transmit more data than what
[7669.96 --> 7675.16]  the slowest connection can support so that could be a major reason that they don't allow super high
[7675.16 --> 7679.96]  ability stuff yeah in addition a streamer will only transmit data if at least one viewer is watching
[7681.80 --> 7684.84]  estimating bandwidth is complicated how we measure performance
[7687.00 --> 7694.36]  so yeah yeah they're not transcoding that helps a lot no yeah no the client transcodes yeah yeah doesn't
[7694.36 --> 7695.00]  solve everything
[7695.00 --> 7706.52]  okay but do they still are they still absorbing the bandwidth cost that's what i want to know
[7711.40 --> 7718.60]  i'm not sure either way discord's model has always been kind of wild to me you look you look at how
[7718.60 --> 7726.44]  much teams and slack cost and then you look at what discord does and in a huge amount of cases far
[7726.44 --> 7731.00]  better than either of those platforms and it's like what
[7733.40 --> 7738.36]  maybe the real question should be why does teams cost that much well and isn't slack like
[7739.24 --> 7743.16]  did you see teams as being decoupled from office did we talk about that on when show already we haven't
[7743.16 --> 7747.40]  talked about that on my show but that is very interesting yeah it's uh interesting timing microsoft's
[7747.40 --> 7752.60]  clearly going hmm we push this really hard in a way that regulators are going to be probably super
[7752.60 --> 7760.12]  unimpressed by maybe if in good faith we decouple this now they won't go back and look at it because
[7760.12 --> 7765.32]  you know what it's the only reason we use teams was because we were effectively forced to buy it
[7766.04 --> 7771.32]  because we needed office i would have happily paid less and not bought teams
[7771.32 --> 7780.04]  it's a really interesting thing because like the taryn linked me that news article see linus you can
[7780.04 --> 7780.76]  uncrime
[7787.00 --> 7791.88]  that's actually pretty funny yeah i mean i guess if in good faith you stopped being unfaithful
[7791.88 --> 7800.28]  before she found out that might earn you some brownie points oh man i think with most people not
[7800.28 --> 7808.04]  enough i mean it's it's some if i did that i am still dead oh i well yeah i won't be at work the
[7808.04 --> 7813.32]  next day dude i won't be alive i'd be alive yvonne's made it very clear what would happen to me
[7813.32 --> 7816.92]  i'd be alive as long as i don't bleed out
[7820.12 --> 7825.00]  understood yeah makes sense and when that woman says something you believe her yeah
[7826.52 --> 7828.36]  she'd be scary sometimes um
[7830.52 --> 7834.92]  what is it like okay yeah i thought i heard i can't find anything on this right now so i don't know if it's
[7834.92 --> 7842.84]  true but i thought slack was like somehow managing to be uh to be having financial issues but i'm not
[7842.84 --> 7847.96]  finding anything on that so i don't that that might have just been completely made up but anyways um
[7847.96 --> 7850.84]  it is something to now reconsider is the use of teams
[7853.96 --> 7857.88]  what ak panda says you cannot bleed out from such a small wound
[7857.88 --> 7866.92]  oh my god
[7868.76 --> 7869.88]  anyways anyways anyway
[7872.76 --> 7873.88]  we uh i'm no drake
[7878.68 --> 7885.40]  we we uh do we keep using teams there's so many problems with it internally i know
[7885.40 --> 7891.96]  and if it's being decoupled anyways i just hate the pain of switching yeah uh
[7893.08 --> 7894.92]  it's kind of bad though i know
[7896.52 --> 7902.12]  yeah it's kind of usable though one of the frustrating things yeah it's slack also has a ton of problems
[7902.12 --> 7907.96]  i've said it before i'll say it again if discord had an enterprise mode i just put us on discord
[7907.96 --> 7915.56]  100 i'd support that but it it there's just a few things it doesn't quite
[7916.20 --> 7919.16]  uh it honestly really doesn't need much more which is
[7920.92 --> 7927.08]  again so interesting to me like kind of infuriating yeah like i can understand the discord branding
[7927.08 --> 7930.60]  just not really making sense for them for a corporate product yeah but they could roll the
[7930.60 --> 7934.68]  same thing different logo yeah yeah yeah cord dis
[7939.64 --> 7944.28]  oh my god sid rock what's uh rock chat like i don't know what's what's the
[7945.88 --> 7952.04]  i don't think you want that i'm sure they could come up with some name i use discord for my company
[7952.04 --> 7957.32]  head of it here that's cool we used to use discord for floatplane as well there's like some issues
[7957.32 --> 7966.36]  with it though yeah um i don't know it's not i i don't think it's i'm you could probably get it
[7966.36 --> 7974.92]  most of the way there for what we need if you had a probably an arrangement of like different bots and
[7974.92 --> 7980.36]  things to manage different stuff um but there's like there's there's reasons you don't actually
[7980.36 --> 7986.44]  necessarily want the window that someone looks at this is less from it this is more from like
[7986.44 --> 7990.76]  operations i guess but you don't necessarily want the window that someone needs to look at for work
[7990.76 --> 7996.76]  to also have all their personal stuff in it and then okay so are you getting them to have a different
[7996.76 --> 8002.52]  work discord account you can't moderate what other things they're joining on the work discord account
[8002.52 --> 8008.68]  um like removing adding and removing someone from the server is not as clean it's pretty easy to get
[8008.68 --> 8015.72]  off task in discord i'll tell you that much you can data retain in slack and in teams which has very
[8016.76 --> 8025.08]  important um benefits for companies right like if you have former staff that's not with you anymore
[8025.08 --> 8032.12]  and you need to like really need to have access to those records uh you can really need them like it can
[8032.12 --> 8038.44]  be it's not the kind of thing that i would ever be comfortable snooping on for no reason yeah but if it
[8038.44 --> 8044.68]  was really needed it could be like all this changes everything kind of thing in that defense if you
[8044.68 --> 8051.80]  did snoop on it for no reason i don't think there's really a way to do that without majorly alerting the user
[8052.68 --> 8059.72]  so like which that's cool actually um but yeah if you want to like data retain direct messages that
[8059.72 --> 8068.04]  someone has from their like work discord like yeah good luck unless you are creating the discord accounts for every one of your users which then
[8068.04 --> 8072.12]  becomes like an onboarding nightmare and you have to track all this stuff and it's just like i
[8073.72 --> 8079.72]  i don't know man i i think it's cool that you use it i actually liked it for a lot of when we used it
[8079.72 --> 8086.52]  for flow plane the reason why we stopped the reason why we stopped was uh maximum maximum message length
[8086.52 --> 8090.84]  um and code snippets and a few other things that were problematic back then i've heard that those have
[8090.84 --> 8095.32]  gotten better and easier to deal with i still don't think migrating back to it is fully an option because
[8095.32 --> 8102.04]  of some of the things that i just mentioned but i honestly i really wish that yeah discord would
[8102.04 --> 8109.56]  figure that out because the calls on discord the amount of times i've had issues with calls on slack
[8109.56 --> 8115.00]  and teams that i just know we wouldn't have had these issues on discord is insane discord calls are
[8115.88 --> 8123.16]  solid yeah i will have issues in teams or slack sometimes and certain people that i know will be
[8123.16 --> 8128.68]  around on discord i'll jump off the teams or slack call and call that person on discord just to be
[8128.68 --> 8133.96]  sometimes i've actually done it sometimes with just employees if i have their discord um but sometimes
[8133.96 --> 8137.48]  i'll do it to friends just to be like hey is my mic working and stuff and they're like yeah i'm like okay
[8137.48 --> 8142.84]  bye just hang up right away go back to the work call to be like okay now i confirmed it's not
[8142.84 --> 8152.84]  yeah yeah anyway percent their video they're streaming even just camera great screen sharing great never
[8152.84 --> 8157.56]  any problems there text chat flows really super well their bot support is fantastic there's a lot of
[8157.56 --> 8162.52]  things that they have going for them that's really really good google podcasts speaking of companies
[8162.52 --> 8168.12]  that have things going for them that are good and then just i don't know uh google podcasts to bye
[8168.12 --> 8173.16]  bye see i actually don't care i don't listen to podcasts but so but you seem more passionate about
[8173.16 --> 8178.44]  this so here let me read the thing let me read the thing really quick google podcasts has finally
[8178.44 --> 8182.84]  shut down in the united states is this going to be your google play music because google play music
[8182.84 --> 8187.80]  is like i i will die on that hill but youtube music is a piece of garbage and if they just brought
[8187.80 --> 8192.84]  google play music back in exactly the form it was in like five years ago or whenever they discontinued
[8192.84 --> 8196.92]  it it would be better than anything else on the market well i i agree because i used google play
[8196.92 --> 8201.64]  music yeah i was a big google play music person why are you using spotify stuff like that all right
[8201.64 --> 8205.80]  so anyway google podcasts has finally shut down in the united states and will soon phase out in the
[8205.80 --> 8209.64]  rest of the world as well in their announcement last year the company indicated that they would be
[8209.64 --> 8215.72]  focusing on youtube music's podcasting features instead oh good we've heard this before apparently
[8215.72 --> 8222.76]  around 23 percent of u.s podcast listeners use youtube as their primary podcast listening platform
[8222.76 --> 8230.28]  and only four percent use google podcasts google's own podcast made by google though isn't available
[8230.28 --> 8236.44]  on the youtube music app yeah that's a fun one so um why do you care why does this matter like it's
[8236.44 --> 8242.04]  audio right so does it matter what you play it in just help me out here uh my the way that i had mine
[8242.04 --> 8247.80]  set up i don't know if this is normal i don't talk to anyone else that listens to podcasts about podcasts um
[8247.80 --> 8253.64]  but it would it would i was like subscribed to a couple podcasts and it would download them for me
[8254.36 --> 8259.72]  so like when i'm on wi-fi it downloads it yeah when i go out for a run or whatever else it's downloaded
[8259.72 --> 8266.04]  i don't have to this helps you not me because you pay for my phone plan but like i i do run that feature
[8266.04 --> 8273.32]  because i actually don't want to just burn through mobile data for no reason um i i like that it's one
[8273.32 --> 8278.28]  specific subscription feed that doesn't have the rest of my youtube junk in it that's just for
[8278.28 --> 8283.48]  podcasts so when i want podcasts i go to just this thing it shows me the podcast that i'm subscribed
[8283.48 --> 8289.16]  to and only those there there's there's not a like what i don't i don't remember because i mean the
[8289.16 --> 8293.40]  app's probably gone at this point but i think there was i'm fairly certain there was a menu that i went
[8293.40 --> 8297.16]  to that never had any recommendations or anything it was just the things i was subscribed to
[8297.16 --> 8303.88]  i could see all the most recent things there easy peasy no problem it worked flawlessly i i saw no
[8303.88 --> 8311.24]  reason to need any other thing for using podcasts it was perfect just pulled up our podcast because i
[8311.24 --> 8316.60]  guess this is a podcast analytics and google podcast is the third highest at eight percent of
[8316.60 --> 8321.64]  yeah there you go so like cool okay a bunch of people watch joe rogan on youtube did we really
[8321.64 --> 8326.76]  need to get rid of google podcast because of that like i don't fun fact you said the app is probably
[8326.76 --> 8333.88]  gone um this is still here it can be gone but it can never be forgotten i i keep the google play
[8333.88 --> 8341.16]  music app on my phone just just to never forget i had where's the focus i had the vessel app on my
[8341.16 --> 8349.00]  phone for years yeah um i still have vessel on here i don't i think i eventually deleted vessel i think i did
[8349.00 --> 8356.28]  too um tv yes i deleted vessel i think i do have something that you haven't been able to get for years
[8356.28 --> 8363.00]  though that isn't vessel let's see is it the pt demo no haha everybody's sad now
[8367.00 --> 8373.24]  let's see there should be other platforms that work like what you want luke oh you still can get
[8373.24 --> 8379.24]  it okay cool all all kind of podcasts work the same way as i'm just an rss i have a google phone and i had
[8379.24 --> 8383.00]  the google app and it's yeah that makes sense i don't have to worry about there's there was no like
[8383.00 --> 8388.52]  ads or anything it was free easy simple that's probably why they got rid of it um yeah not
[8388.52 --> 8395.56]  profitable enough yeah yeah i don't know it just it just sucks like in other good google news google
[8395.56 --> 8402.92]  invents the super skip oh uh the source here is creator insider youtube is experimenting with a
[8402.92 --> 8409.80]  potential new feature he's feeling physical pain this is great potential new feature called jump ahead
[8409.80 --> 8416.60]  which allows premium users to skip immediately to the best parts of the video they're watching
[8417.16 --> 8422.60]  this will also be available to creators on their own videos even if they aren't a premium subscriber i
[8422.60 --> 8428.44]  guess so you can see why the heck this positive feedback loop exists where the most popular part of
[8428.44 --> 8433.24]  the video is now the only part anybody is watching and it becomes even more popular and then so basically
[8433.24 --> 8439.64]  shorts wasn't enough they want to turn vods into shorts brilliant if a user has already
[8439.64 --> 8444.76]  double tapped to skip forward they'll get a jump ahead button that takes them to a spot that
[8444.76 --> 8452.76]  youtube's algorithm thinks they might be looking for based on their previous viewing behavior google
[8452.76 --> 8459.24]  of course used the term ai multiple times to describe this feature our discussion question is could this
[8459.24 --> 8466.04]  be valuable if implemented properly or is this just encouraging us to turn our brains to mush would you
[8466.04 --> 8471.48]  get ed to script a thing that just constantly edits our videos and moves where the graphs are
[8478.36 --> 8484.84]  no because we've got our own that the ltd labs website hey yeah like we're we're gonna we're gonna save
[8484.84 --> 8490.12]  you the trouble if you don't like the videos then we'll we'll have this sorted out for you in the in
[8490.12 --> 8495.16]  the near future okay yeah speaking of which they've actually got another article up there
[8497.40 --> 8502.92]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah of course i did so it's another gpu just because that's what we are
[8502.92 --> 8508.52]  most we're most set up for right now but we're we're still optimizing a lot of things we've made a lot of
[8508.52 --> 8513.64]  changes based on your feedback from last time and a lot of those changes are already live so all that's up
[8513.64 --> 8519.56]  here all right so you can see an author and it is more readable you can share it yeah no it looks man
[8519.56 --> 8525.16]  it looks pro dude it looks pro links to where to buy purchases may provide compensation we had a lot
[8525.16 --> 8530.92]  of people sort of asking are these affiliate links yes yes they're affiliate links oh yeah um expand you
[8530.92 --> 8536.04]  can learn about the hardware you can we've got some pictures we we have got we've got work to do on our
[8536.04 --> 8543.56]  pictures we we know that i still really like the luma field scans i know they look so sick so cool i
[8543.56 --> 8547.40]  would jump to these articles just to see that i think those are so cool yeah that thing as well we
[8547.40 --> 8555.08]  have a dedicated video coming on the luma field ct scanner man oh we scanned buzz lightyear from the
[8555.08 --> 8561.40]  tech shop just scan all kinds of cool stuff for that yeah it was alex in charge of that video so you
[8561.40 --> 8567.96]  know we scanned some memes um and not gonna lie like looking at the charts on here is is a great
[8567.96 --> 8576.60]  experience yep there it is you can uh if you guys didn't watch last time then uh here i think it's up
[8576.60 --> 8582.68]  here yep you can configure what colors you like for for charts if you are colorblind or have any other
[8582.68 --> 8587.08]  kind of impairment that makes it difficult you could change the theme of the site change between imperial
[8587.08 --> 8599.48]  and metric units super cool i have feedback for my own site you can just you know see whatever
[8599.48 --> 8606.52]  charts it is you feel like looking at what what's the best card for 4k rocket league well basically
[8606.52 --> 8615.08]  anything okay uh uh uh uh cyberpunk hey here we go freaking awesome oh wait hold on a second what if i want
[8615.08 --> 8623.64]  to know about ray tracing performance i guess i could see that here f123 oh we only do 14 for that
[8623.64 --> 8630.68]  actually kind of makes sense uh so there's our ray tracing performance and productivity oh yes and a
[8630.68 --> 8641.56]  bench gpu yeah man it's gonna be great once we've got oh can i add to the comparison bin
[8645.08 --> 8651.56]  and add this to the comparison bin oh there's a faster way to do this add to the does the comparison
[8651.56 --> 8662.92]  bin work no way okay so i can see the highlights i can see the tested settings i can see their supported
[8662.92 --> 8666.36]  features oh oh
[8666.36 --> 8675.32]  oem technologies i can see what test bench they were tested on to make sure that they are comparable
[8676.44 --> 8684.28]  very cool i can be linked to this product if it were to exist at some point oh that's just to buy it
[8684.28 --> 8690.76]  okay well it'd be cool if that could go to the um our product page for it eventually eventually when we have
[8690.76 --> 8698.12]  it um maybe i i kind of like the affiliate link thing there so maybe we could actually have things for both or something
[8699.16 --> 8705.08]  super cool gotta make money somehow you know we just want to make things we just want to make things
[8705.08 --> 8711.88]  easier both we can link to the review and the affiliate but we just want to make things easier okay and uh
[8711.88 --> 8713.88]  uh
[8714.92 --> 8719.48]  it would be nice in the long term to standardize our testing to the point where
[8720.04 --> 8726.60]  uh we can with a high degree of confidence show you both cards on the same graph but as it is now
[8727.40 --> 8732.92]  there's a lot of work to do before we can do that with confidence it's a dangerous step yeah it's a cool step
[8733.16 --> 8737.72]  yeah it's a dangerous because i think there's there's going to be a time in the future
[8737.72 --> 8745.00]  where people are going to want and we are going to want to fulfill the need for this um people are
[8745.00 --> 8751.40]  going to want to compare things that weren't tested apples to apples so if we can figure out through
[8751.40 --> 8757.80]  similar work to what we did when we were testing our 7800x3ds to see which ones were close enough
[8757.80 --> 8763.56]  if we can if we can do the work to figure out what those error bars should look like um
[8763.56 --> 8773.24]  um we would like to be able to present that data with asterisks right because we can't uh we can't
[8773.24 --> 8781.56]  test every single gpu under every single circumstance um so it's like yeah okay these are both on the same
[8781.56 --> 8789.00]  graph but note that this one is using a generation newer driver or even uh faster ram when we had upgraded
[8789.00 --> 8796.36]  our test platform or something like that in time in time sorry i wanted to get that very exciting
[8796.36 --> 8804.84]  though man the team's worked so hard all right what else we got today oh truth social i can't believe
[8804.84 --> 8812.92]  we've never talked about truth social have we not we've like mentioned it in passing it's a big social
[8812.92 --> 8822.36]  media site they went public oh yeah their valuation valuation uh eight billion eight billion dollars
[8822.36 --> 8829.00]  yep ipo a few weeks ago march 26th under the ticker code djt it closed the day at almost eight billion
[8829.00 --> 8835.56]  dollars the site has around five million active monthly users and then seven days later fec filings
[8835.56 --> 8843.72]  showed that it had lost 58 million dollars in 2023 and made 4.8 million dollars in revenue isn't that
[8843.72 --> 8850.36]  better than what twitter was doing uh no i thought twitter was losing like a lot more than that right but
[8850.36 --> 8859.32]  twitter had revenue and like user growth user growth yeah so uh users aren't growing got it yeah uh
[8859.32 --> 8865.32]  uh following this revelation the stock began to crater yeah um
[8865.56 --> 8875.72]  wait yeah what the ticker code is djt yeah that took me a second to like someone in floatplane chat
[8875.72 --> 8881.08]  questioned it and i was like hold on there's been a bunch of behind the scenes shenanigans um
[8881.72 --> 8889.40]  former president donald trump uh sued a couple of the of his co-founders in an apparent attempt to
[8889.40 --> 8895.00]  consolidate shares in the company um a pair of brothers who were early investors pled guilty to
[8895.00 --> 8901.40]  insider trading related to the merger of digital world acquisition corp and truth social's parent
[8901.40 --> 8905.40]  company uh so that was part of the spacc deal that took it public um
[8907.48 --> 8909.32]  i don't know how much it's worth right now
[8911.24 --> 8916.36]  let's let's go have a look oh no not dow jones transportation
[8916.36 --> 8925.64]  um that came up for me too i mean it's a more relevant stock why why am i not just getting
[8927.56 --> 8934.68]  why am i not just getting a proper stupid thing here yeah weird not digital world acquisition oh man
[8935.32 --> 8941.48]  i just want oh well okay it's a trending it's apparently a trending ticker so here hold on i just all
[8941.48 --> 8947.88]  i have to do is click it of course it is there we go all right so uh how are we doing here so at launch
[8948.84 --> 8955.16]  is there even a month of history yet no yeah so at launch it actually went up which is uh which is
[8955.16 --> 8966.44]  something um and then honestly not as bad as i expected yeah yeah it's only down from a high of 75 ish to uh
[8966.44 --> 8971.88]  40. which if you put a lot of what if you put a meaningful amount of your money into it you'd
[8971.88 --> 8977.40]  probably be pretty disappointed about absolutely but we've seen worse maybe i'm just desensitized from
[8977.40 --> 8987.16]  looking at coins i'm not sure anyway the only the only thing the only really the only thing that we're
[8987.16 --> 8994.68]  really um the only reason we're really bringing this up is this is not financial advice but no do not
[8994.68 --> 9002.60]  with this stock people smarter than you who have been playing the game longer than you are
[9002.60 --> 9009.96]  manipulating this both up and down you do not want to be caught holding the bag this is not a real
[9009.96 --> 9018.76]  social media platform there is no real business model watch out 4.8 million dollars in revenue truth
[9018.76 --> 9025.64]  social is a smaller less profitable company than linus media group incorporated in fact
[9026.76 --> 9033.72]  hold on time to raise that eight billion dude hold on a second let's go hold on a second build a heck of a lab
[9033.72 --> 9052.04]  in revenue you tell people revenue in revenue okay it is no no no no no just relax oh my people
[9052.04 --> 9060.04]  reverse look at his hands he's like uh yeah yeah yeah no so in in revenue in revenue it is
[9060.04 --> 9071.88]  not even triple the size of float plane media yeah i never even did that okay and i have intentionally
[9071.88 --> 9078.28]  fudged things a little hey man i'm down with less than a just a little bit less than a third of eight
[9078.28 --> 9085.80]  billion dollars yeah let's do it just to give you guys some some much needed context
[9085.80 --> 9094.04]  if truth social is worth eight billion dollars float plane media inc
[9096.12 --> 9102.36]  is at least a two and a half billion dollar company so we're we're going we're going out for
[9102.36 --> 9108.92]  stakes after this it's it's not sorry you can get a higher approval limit now luke
[9108.92 --> 9116.04]  yeah we can get new pens new pens would be awesome the only pen on my desk is when someone gave to me
[9116.76 --> 9124.28]  float plane media float plane media is also more profitable than truth social that's yeah i mean
[9125.64 --> 9130.44]  the fundamentals i would hope it would be wow luke you did the bare minimum you're
[9130.44 --> 9137.16]  you're not like you know down 10x your revenue wow oh
[9139.88 --> 9140.84]  so watch out
[9142.84 --> 9147.24]  i mean should we take float plane public no i could use a billion dollars
[9148.12 --> 9153.80]  you know if we're gonna raise if we're gonna raise a big b i'm down with it yeah let's go i mean heck yeah
[9153.80 --> 9156.12]  i mean
[9157.48 --> 9163.96]  pajama pants for all no pants at work let's just i mean we've got a billion dollars in the bank who cares
[9164.84 --> 9172.44]  yeah yeah people like shut up and take my money do it do it guys guys no you shouldn't invest in
[9172.44 --> 9177.08]  float plane no that wasn't my point my guys collectively have a billion dollars yeah my point
[9177.08 --> 9183.32]  wasn't to invest in float plane my point was do not get mixed up in this truth social thing because
[9184.68 --> 9190.12]  whatever you bet if you bet it's going up it's gonna go down if you bet it's going down it's gonna
[9190.12 --> 9195.00]  go up it is being manipulated on both sides be
[9197.40 --> 9203.48]  smart be smart that's uh that's all i really wanted to say that riley was super worried when i was like
[9203.48 --> 9209.72]  yeah we're gonna talk about truth social on the show he's like like no no no no no no no no no
[9209.72 --> 9214.12]  we're just we we are just what we're really talking about is how float plane is worth a billion dollars
[9214.12 --> 9221.16]  yeah this is not financial advice i'll put all my linus coin in float plane heck yeah hey when's the
[9221.16 --> 9227.96]  ico voice man if we were willing to grift hard man ah we could have made so much more money
[9227.96 --> 9233.64]  could have made so much more money yeah ah sometimes i wish we were eviler there's been
[9233.64 --> 9239.96]  a few discussions where we're like wow we could really do this hey the best time there is in
[9239.96 --> 9247.72]  promoting gambling oh man oh you could have probably over doubled the company revenue and i'm not kidding
[9247.72 --> 9253.24]  i know yeah i know people might think that you are you heard the valuation that was
[9253.24 --> 9261.00]  or at least the proposed evaluation that that happened a while ago that would just you would
[9261.00 --> 9264.68]  completely blow it out of the water it wouldn't even be close wouldn't even be sort of close it
[9264.68 --> 9271.08]  might be significantly more than 2x actually like there is trust me i've seen offers a disgusting
[9271.08 --> 9277.00]  amount of money offers come it's not that we don't promote gambling because we never got contacted
[9277.80 --> 9283.08]  come on don't kid yourself i know creators personally because i don't think i've seen our offers
[9283.08 --> 9287.88]  actually but i've seen offers to other creators i know creators personally that have received offers
[9287.88 --> 9293.40]  for gambling sponsorships that are many times bigger than other unrelated to gambling offers that
[9293.40 --> 9300.60]  i've seen us receive and take because we thought they were good this creator in particular if i remember
[9300.60 --> 9309.56]  correctly was significantly less than like a tenth of our size it's just monster money it's crazy and you
[9309.56 --> 9318.76]  wonder like turns out stealing people's money is good business yeah yeah i shouldn't say stealing
[9319.88 --> 9325.56]  you gave it to them sure yeah but just taking people's money is good business it's almost like
[9325.56 --> 9335.24]  plenty time no no so that's a lot less than yeah that's uh that's an inside reference yeah um yeah but
[9335.24 --> 9338.04]  yeah it was incredible amounts of money and you think too when it's like
[9341.48 --> 9347.88]  smaller creators i can see why they do it it's gotta be hard it's life-changing it's like you've
[9347.88 --> 9353.72]  got medical bills it's make or break people yeah if if money's super tight and someone knocks on your
[9353.72 --> 9359.00]  door and is like hey this is a really important point because i have the luxury like i have to i have
[9359.00 --> 9363.96]  to step back and appreciate that i have the luxury to say no we can make it without it yep
[9363.96 --> 9370.12]  yep i that was a big moment for me was when we reached the point where i could walk away from
[9370.12 --> 9376.84]  any deal and it from any company and it wouldn't matter yeah because we we walked away from some
[9376.84 --> 9382.44]  deals early on but it hurt man we've walked away from entire relationships nvidia's back though you
[9382.44 --> 9388.92]  saw that sponsored video they're back upgrading our worst setup uh jessica making not her on-screen
[9388.92 --> 9393.16]  debut because she's been on lan show before and stuff like that but this is the first time in a mainline ltt
[9393.16 --> 9398.76]  video i thought she did a great job um we really really improved her setup so if you haven't
[9398.76 --> 9404.28]  watched it yet you're gonna want to check it out her podcasting setup was literally in a closet um
[9405.16 --> 9411.56]  sorry and it still is but it's a better closet improved closet new and improved closet two now with 30
[9411.56 --> 9421.08]  more closet do you move a wall uh someone in flow plane chat and golden 2020 said nearly 200 million
[9421.08 --> 9428.28]  dollars us dollars were bet in north carolina's first week of legalized sports betting wow
[9430.84 --> 9437.16]  how are there even 200 billion dollars million oh oh that makes way more sense yeah even so i might
[9437.16 --> 9442.76]  have said billion i meant million that's a two hundred billion that's a fifth of a b yeah like that's a fifth
[9442.76 --> 9452.60]  of the valuation flow plane sometimes i do sometimes i do wonder sometimes i do wonder
[9452.60 --> 9460.28]  having the community that we have if we were just like hey realistically we're pretty up front with you
[9460.28 --> 9465.96]  guys anyway so what we just formalize this we release quarterly earnings reports and blah blah blah blah blah
[9465.96 --> 9471.16]  blah and if you want to give us your money i just keep all the controlling shares kind of like zuck did
[9471.16 --> 9477.32]  and like sure by all means and then what like i just maybe i just lack creativity but i wouldn't
[9477.32 --> 9482.36]  know what to do with it like let's say our valuation wasn't eight billion dollars let's say it was
[9484.44 --> 9490.68]  eight million dollars okay more than that let's say it was 80 million dollars what would i even do i have
[9490.68 --> 9495.88]  a i don't know if this spicy take or not i have a take on this it feels like a spicy take okay yeah let's
[9495.88 --> 9507.40]  hear a spicy take what what would i think you need to not i think you'd go insane
[9510.20 --> 9515.56]  not because there's so many things you could spend your money on but because you'd need a new thing to
[9515.56 --> 9521.24]  chase and you'd have so much money that would be so hard you'd have to like make a fab or something
[9521.24 --> 9526.60]  ridiculous like it would be but like think about it okay not that we couldn't afford that with 80
[9526.60 --> 9529.80]  million dollars no but that's the point oh
[9532.60 --> 9538.36]  because he does this we'll like we'll like be very successful and then he'll be like okay
[9539.16 --> 9545.24]  now we're gonna do this crazy thing and i'm gonna go super negative i'm gonna risk it all we're gonna
[9545.24 --> 9548.84]  i'm gonna like leverage all the different things i'm gonna do all this other kind of stuff and we're
[9548.84 --> 9553.08]  gonna do this it's gonna be successful we're gonna be fine so this is why i don't promote gambling
[9553.80 --> 9554.84]  because i have a problem
[9557.64 --> 9563.16]  but it's like usually the plan's really good and it like yeah we will actually be fine it has worked
[9563.16 --> 9570.12]  eventually every time well some are tbd but yeah i'm feeling good i'm feeling good but
[9570.12 --> 9572.68]  lions will get too comfortable and then he's like
[9572.68 --> 9581.00]  i need something i gotta i gotta buy a building figure out something to put in it start a game
[9581.00 --> 9586.36]  publisher yeah like stuff we've kicked stuff we've kicked the tires on it started a system integrator
[9586.92 --> 9594.04]  man when we did that video uh upgrading my game gear and uh david's game boy advanced i was like i had
[9594.04 --> 9599.48]  we had you and i had a conversation yeah about starting a company i was like man the problems in this
[9599.48 --> 9608.76]  space are that there's it's it's like i can have a reliable source for the part a good price or fast
[9608.76 --> 9617.64]  pick one to two yeah right often one often one and so i was like man if we could we make like a like
[9617.64 --> 9625.48]  a retro console you know modding like one-stop shop where we we basically take on the inventory risk of
[9625.48 --> 9629.72]  you know ordering enough that these small manufacturers can afford to do a run of
[9629.72 --> 9636.76]  stupid game gear back lights or or whatever it is so so we hold the inventory um we use our brand we
[9636.76 --> 9643.24]  use our trusted brand to um give people confidence in in the product we we stand behind the product with
[9643.24 --> 9650.92]  the trust me bro guarantee uh we we continue to expand by taking our storeroom of parts and allowing
[9650.92 --> 9655.16]  people to ship in their consoles so we hire technicians to perform upgrades for people and
[9655.16 --> 9660.92]  offer it as a service like there's a whole there's a whole roadmap here boys i i actually ran the
[9660.92 --> 9665.88]  numbers i think we could get it started for probably less than 150 grand like
[9668.68 --> 9675.00]  no no no no no no i don't need another project part of his problem is that he surrounds himself with
[9675.00 --> 9682.84]  people like me so i'm just gonna be like yeah cool let's do it it is cool it is a lot of the ideas are
[9682.84 --> 9687.56]  cool it's a great idea but this is a problem if you just suddenly had 80 million dollars oh yeah
[9687.56 --> 9692.12]  you're gonna be like we'd do 80 ideas yeah you're not wrong yeah you're not wrong see that's the
[9692.12 --> 9697.40]  thing it's like well a lot of people talk about that offer we got like like i have like i have like
[9697.40 --> 9703.32]  that's in the bank how many figures is that i don't remember nine like i have nine figures in the
[9703.32 --> 9709.96]  bank it it doesn't it doesn't work like that that's uh that's theoretical that's theoretical
[9709.96 --> 9715.96]  net worth it's not it's not real and if i if i were to sell it today it's probably not worth that
[9715.96 --> 9719.96]  much that was based on the kind of exponential growth that we were experiencing at that time
[9719.96 --> 9725.72]  we've gotten things are a little bit in more of a mature state right now and um we've also got some
[9725.72 --> 9734.84]  big bets that are taking time to reach fruition um but yeah we don't have that kind of actual like
[9734.84 --> 9739.80]  cash reserves just sitting around it's not really how businesses work and borrowing is
[9741.24 --> 9745.80]  so expensive right now to be clear i'm not going to complain because a lot of people are worried
[9745.80 --> 9749.56]  about the borrowing that they're doing on their bloody homes and how to figure out how to pay their
[9749.56 --> 9755.40]  mortgage payments but it's been challenging on the business side as well without just free money
[9755.72 --> 9761.80]  flowing the way that it did um so yeah we just you know we just got to pick our battles but yeah
[9761.80 --> 9771.16]  i think i think going public would be unnecessary we've we've talked about it a lot internally and
[9771.16 --> 9777.24]  i just don't i think i mean realistically i've told i've told taren he's got the wheel like nothing's
[9777.24 --> 9781.48]  off the table if he wants to like if he thinks that's the the right path then he's you know free to
[9781.48 --> 9786.92]  make a case and and try and do it and make a go of it but i i don't i don't think you would want to
[9786.92 --> 9794.68]  anyways i could see i i've kind of wondered before about like a part of the business a particular part
[9794.68 --> 9802.20]  for some reason like maybe maybe you actually wanted i don't know i don't know maybe for some
[9802.20 --> 9806.12]  reason not even necessarily to raise money let's say something wild like we started uh remember that
[9806.12 --> 9811.88]  gaming hotel i stayed in like five years ago yeah so if we were to start like a gaming hotel business
[9811.88 --> 9818.04]  okay and it's a complete spin-off it's got like ltt branding on it it's like there's gaming systems in
[9818.04 --> 9824.60]  every room uh but other than that it has no financial tie to linus media group or float plane or
[9825.48 --> 9832.20]  the theme rooms you could do would be wild oh that'd be so cool with gaming ips well or even like
[9832.20 --> 9836.68]  hardware ips i don't know how i don't know how gaming ips would work if everything you buy
[9836.68 --> 9842.36]  is licensed does anything restrict you from putting it in a commercial space oh i was even thinking
[9842.36 --> 9846.84]  getting them to like pay you to do it potentially some i mean there's certainly companies that would
[9846.84 --> 9851.16]  not give us the time of day but but if not yeah what are they what are they going to do like if you
[9851.16 --> 9859.72]  have a a figure of a plumber who goes into pipes sometimes i mean the company you're talking about
[9859.72 --> 9864.36]  the figure i'm sure they'd find a way they'll do it is there is there a terms is terms of service
[9864.36 --> 9872.20]  of buying a figurine i mean if it's an amiibo i bet there is but yeah yeah i wonder about that that's
[9872.20 --> 9876.28]  something you'd have to ask but you'd have to ask the lawyers but if you created it yourself like if
[9876.28 --> 9884.20]  you drew it i think you'd be in trouble interesting nobody goes after like you know the the local
[9884.20 --> 9889.40]  tim hortons that you know draws a christmas scene on their thing and then wipes it in january or
[9889.40 --> 9896.84]  whatever uh but in terms of like if you are offering a a plumber room at your gaming hotel
[9897.24 --> 9905.96]  and you've like custom created mario alike assets i i i i yeah that's that's a commercial endeavor
[9905.96 --> 9914.36]  you are effectively selling access to mario's likeness like there's no way yeah um tim sp asks are
[9914.36 --> 9918.52]  you going to talk about all the geek squad layoffs that came out in the past couple of days does it
[9918.52 --> 9922.68]  change how you look back at your experience having them try to fix a machine for you i mean my
[9922.68 --> 9929.72]  experience was my experience i um i take back nothing of what we said uh i think i think best
[9929.72 --> 9936.20]  buy owes me a refund um they did not fix my problem they charged me 200 canadian rubles i haven't
[9936.20 --> 9944.52]  watched it yet but as an ex-member of geek squad it just makes me sad um as for as for the layoffs that's
[9944.52 --> 9950.12]  extremely sad because like so many corporate layoffs this feels like one where
[9951.56 --> 9956.12]  it comes down to mismanagement right like whether you overhired or whether you're not bringing in
[9956.12 --> 9963.32]  business well enough it's not the fault of those frontline agents right that that customers aren't
[9963.32 --> 9969.96]  coming in it's part of it honestly computers just don't have as many problems these days i mean that's
[9969.96 --> 9976.44]  that's that's that's fair but also oh man that's a tough one because it's not like it's not like geek
[9976.44 --> 9983.32]  squad is something that um it's not like they haven't had plenty of opportunities to observe a slow decline
[9983.32 --> 9989.40]  in unreliability totally and and adjust their staffing levels accordingly i just i don't know if i buy that
[9989.40 --> 9999.56]  as an excuse yeah that's fair i just scrolled down to where people are talking about um
[10001.32 --> 10005.32]  just like nintendo and amiibos you don't own the amiibo you bought a license to look at it at
[10005.32 --> 10014.52]  nintendo's convenience yeah exactly oh my goodness love it all right in other news the indie game gold rush
[10014.52 --> 10020.04]  seems to be over red hook and metacrit the developers for darkest dungeon and slay the
[10020.04 --> 10025.88]  spy respectively say that funding has dried up for indie games i think it's mega crit oh sorry yeah
[10025.88 --> 10032.68]  that makes way more sense uh notably sources like exclusive deals for the epic game store and xbox game
[10032.68 --> 10038.76]  pass which have both slowed significantly they say that most other devs they've talked to have reported
[10038.76 --> 10043.72]  a similar experience of finding typical funding streams significantly cut back or cancelled
[10044.36 --> 10050.04]  both studios say they're lucky to be in the position to self-fund but they'll be putting on a triple i
[10050.04 --> 10055.08]  showcase of upcoming indie titles on april 10th to give other indie developers more visibility that's
[10055.08 --> 10061.08]  a really cool thing to do very cool and uh we'd love to see what comes out of that that's uh that's five days
[10061.08 --> 10067.16]  from now our discussion question is is this the end of the indie boom or just a gully and i i don't think
[10067.16 --> 10072.60]  anything's going to stop the indie boom if anything i think we're going to see another boom from all the
[10072.60 --> 10079.00]  talented people that are getting let go from the major development houses right now yeah um they're
[10079.00 --> 10085.16]  going to need to do something and their experience is game development so you put two and two together
[10085.16 --> 10090.52]  and i talk about that in the flow plane exclusive where i said i was going to talk about starfield and
[10090.52 --> 10096.12]  ended up talking about the game industry i talked about that exact same thing very nice yeah uh mega crit
[10096.12 --> 10102.68]  they they make slay the spire i'm a massive ridiculous slay the spire nerd um you know when the the whole
[10104.04 --> 10109.88]  unity thing went down yeah and he got weird with their life which one yeah i think it was i think it
[10109.88 --> 10116.60]  was one of the more recent ones but that is kind of funny um mega crit responded by looking into godot
[10116.60 --> 10123.80]  essentially and they made a free game called dancing duelists and it's actually like amazing
[10125.08 --> 10129.48]  new game from mega crit this was about six months ago which lines up pretty well i think with the
[10129.48 --> 10136.12]  last time that unity went a little crazy um it's a it's a deck building game similar to
[10137.00 --> 10142.60]  how so the spire is a deck building game but it plays completely differently and it's very fun free
[10142.60 --> 10147.08]  little game you can like essentially fully beat it um in like probably i don't know a day or two or
[10147.08 --> 10155.64]  something but i i would check it out mega crit super cool yeah uh what else do we have for topics
[10155.64 --> 10160.60]  today outlook's been doing some sketchy stuff uh email service proton is accusing microsoft's new
[10160.60 --> 10165.88]  outlook app of being a massive net for user data collection according to users in europe who downloaded
[10165.88 --> 10171.48]  the app a pop-up user agreement discloses that microsoft shares users information with 801
[10171.48 --> 10177.64]  third-party partners the app also prompts users to pick their own ads layout for where advertisements
[10177.64 --> 10183.56]  will appear in the app mac users will have some ads that appear as inbox messages both from microsoft
[10183.56 --> 10189.00]  and from other parties uk users can access a list of advertising partners in the outlook settings menu
[10189.00 --> 10194.84]  which shows a large number of ad companies these settings are unavailable in the us and switzerland
[10194.84 --> 10201.08]  where proton is based while uk users have some ability to refuse to share with certain advertisers
[10201.08 --> 10206.68]  this appears to be purposefully confusing with some advertisers requiring affirmative consent while
[10206.68 --> 10215.08]  others require an opt out according to german it experts at heiss online this new outlook also takes
[10215.08 --> 10222.28]  imap and smtp credentials your username and password from other accounts synced with the outlook app which
[10222.28 --> 10228.84]  would also give the company access to emails from those other accounts even if you cancel because they've
[10228.84 --> 10235.32]  already stored that information germany's federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of
[10235.32 --> 10239.96]  information ulrich kelber has expressed concern about the app's data farming capabilities and announced
[10239.96 --> 10245.72]  that he intends to discuss the issue with relevant regulators in the coming week common eu win i suspect
[10245.72 --> 10251.88]  the same stuff is not happening to enterprise outlook accounts i mean who knows but you know what is
[10251.88 --> 10258.68]  happening somebody tried to corrupt linux from the inside yeah there's been some unfortunate things going on
[10258.84 --> 10265.16]  a single off hours microsoft engineer has apparently foiled a long con attempt to embed a serious
[10265.16 --> 10271.24]  security backdoor into a widely distributed linux utility developer andres fruand
[10272.12 --> 10279.72]  was spending his long weekend doing some micro benchmarking when he noticed that encrypted logins to
[10279.72 --> 10286.20]  the backdoor into the backdoor into the backdoor in the backdoor in the upstream xzutils repository
[10286.20 --> 10292.20]  sorry not sure how to pronounce that um we're using a surprising amount of cpu
[10292.92 --> 10299.80]  he tracked the issue to a backdoor in the upstream xzutils repository which appears to inject malicious
[10299.80 --> 10305.96]  code during ssh authorization in order to enable unauthorized remote access the backdoor appears to have been
[10305.96 --> 10310.92]  added in february and never managed to make its way into the production release of a major distro
[10311.56 --> 10317.08]  it was uncovered in beta versions of fedora rawhide and debian which have been rolled back accordingly
[10317.08 --> 10324.44]  fruand tracked the changes to a user who goes by gia tan or gia t75 who has been a regular contributor
[10324.44 --> 10332.12]  since october of 2021 however there is no evidence that this person even exists outside of their presence as a
[10332.12 --> 10337.56]  project xz contributor leading some security researchers to speculate that they might be
[10337.56 --> 10345.00]  a single purpose identity created by a state-sponsored attacker gia t75 is believed to have gradually amassed
[10345.00 --> 10351.72]  increasingly invasive permissions in part by making genuine code contributions but also possibly through
[10351.72 --> 10358.12]  a sock puppet campaign to pressure the original dev to speed up development by opening those permissions to
[10358.12 --> 10370.20]  others absolutely insidious um which makes you wonder how much of this did make it through at some point
[10370.84 --> 10377.88]  yeah i mean this type of stuff has happened before um like the login credentials for contributors to
[10377.88 --> 10380.20]  open source projects that are widely used are like
[10380.20 --> 10390.76]  very valuable um to like maintainer accounts and whatnot it doesn't happen very often i think
[10390.76 --> 10396.68]  i just said it's happened before i didn't say it said it happened often um because i think that
[10396.68 --> 10402.60]  community is like pretty on the nose about this type of stuff um there's there's it's it's relatively
[10402.60 --> 10407.80]  commonly said that like open source stuff is generally more secure because more people are looking at it
[10407.80 --> 10414.04]  it doesn't mean it's immune to security problems it just means it can potentially be more secure
[10414.04 --> 10418.20]  um it does it definitely doesn't mean it is more secure you can have projects that are abandoned you
[10418.20 --> 10423.48]  can have not eyeballs on it doesn't automatically mean a lot of people are looking at it and assessing it
[10423.48 --> 10429.96]  um but yeah it sucks it just another reminder that absolutely nothing is fully secure at any point in time
[10431.40 --> 10437.56]  that's it yeah it's frustrating to see this kind of thing degrade trust in open source overall
[10437.56 --> 10444.36]  i um i would say overall you're probably still better off there yeah it's like i just said
[10444.36 --> 10449.08]  everything has problems everything has problems you shouldn't have been blindly trusting open source
[10449.72 --> 10455.00]  um you also shouldn't blindly trust some closed source application from somebody else
[10455.00 --> 10460.28]  um so it is what it is you also shouldn't blindly trust twitter it turns out there's still a bunch of
[10460.28 --> 10468.12]  hypocrites when it comes to privacy i know right way the intercept has acquired emails between the
[10468.12 --> 10475.56]  secret service and surveillance firm data miner that show that elon musk's x has continued secretly
[10475.56 --> 10481.96]  selling massive amounts of user data for the explicit purpose of government surveillance this goes against
[10482.52 --> 10488.28]  x twitter's own use policy which forbids conducting or providing surveillance or gathering intelligence
[10488.28 --> 10493.96]  so it's only okay when we do it for money while twitter is not directly selling this information to the
[10493.96 --> 10499.96]  government it is knowingly leasing the information to an intermediary broker which is immediately turning
[10499.96 --> 10505.72]  it over to the government for law enforcement and surveillance purpose surveillance purposes for the last
[10505.72 --> 10511.16]  decade twitter has also been pursuing a lawsuit demanding that they be allowed to publicly disclose more
[10511.16 --> 10517.16]  information about national security letters that the government uses to compel social media companies to turn over user data
[10517.16 --> 10522.52]  musk continued the suit after taking over the site and called the supreme court's january decision to
[10522.52 --> 10529.80]  strike the case down disappointing a discussion question here is twitter's hypocrisy obviously predates musk's tenure
[10529.80 --> 10535.40]  but how has an overt free speech advocate managed to wind up with such a similar stance on cooperating with
[10535.40 --> 10543.16]  government surveillance as the people he sought to usurp i actually have a feeling that it has less to do with
[10543.16 --> 10551.00]  financial incentives and more has to do with like you must do this uh i mean you don't have to take money
[10551.00 --> 10557.40]  for it i have a feeling there isn't really another option it's like here take the money or we'll just destroy you
[10557.40 --> 10568.28]  anyways um i don't know not sure i mean i would be interested to see if there's a similar arrangement with meta i'd be
[10568.28 --> 10572.60]  similar i'd be curious to see if there's a similar arrangement with you know a discord we know this
[10572.60 --> 10579.80]  just happened with youtube um yeah but that's not really the same arrangement yeah yeah they weren't
[10579.80 --> 10585.32]  selling to data brokers for it to be used for government surveillance i really don't think that's the same
[10585.32 --> 10591.88]  thing yeah yeah oh yeah all i'm really trying to say is if right now at least if the government wants your
[10591.88 --> 10596.92]  stuff for the most part they're going to get it this is why companies that like really really really
[10596.92 --> 10602.52]  talk about privacy yeah don't have anything they don't have any of the information so that when
[10602.52 --> 10606.92]  the government comes knocking they literally can't give it to them it's not a function which to be
[10606.92 --> 10614.04]  clear is not something that you can necessarily trust either no i mean a lot of vpn providers say
[10614.04 --> 10621.48]  oh yeah no logs no but you are just it's full trust me bro you can't prove they don't have anything
[10621.48 --> 10626.28]  unless it's actually been tested in court before and even then even then just because it's been tested
[10626.28 --> 10631.16]  once doesn't mean that something didn't change something can change on a whim doesn't mean that
[10631.16 --> 10637.32]  there isn't like a malicious actor in there somehow who is logging personally yep yeah like it's it's
[10637.32 --> 10638.92]  yeah i don't know it's a thing
[10641.80 --> 10645.56]  i think the main thing that i'm trying to say is that i don't trust that it would completely stop
[10645.56 --> 10650.36]  even if there wasn't financial incentive i don't trust that it would completely stop but um it might be
[10650.36 --> 10655.48]  different might be smaller in scope it's not in the doc but apparently like it's it's it's basically like an
[10655.48 --> 10662.04]  all you can eat api access this is my understanding of it it's like no it's it's like it's bad it's
[10662.04 --> 10665.56]  yeah it's you know it's it's really bad i had never heard of this i don't know the scope of it or how
[10665.56 --> 10669.80]  much money is being used yeah i mean it's one of those things where if the hypocrisy wasn't already obvious
[10669.80 --> 10676.44]  when um uh when he sued that uh that watchdog group that like anti-hate speech watchdog group
[10676.44 --> 10682.76]  for saying stuff he didn't like really yeah it's like free speech is not just speech you agree with
[10682.76 --> 10687.24]  it's free oh wait was this the anti-defamation league stuff uh no i don't think it was them i think
[10687.24 --> 10691.64]  it was someone else i don't know basically i like actually try not to follow it because it just yeah
[10691.64 --> 10696.36]  there's a not-for-profit that uh reported on an increase in hate speech and that that may be true
[10696.36 --> 10702.44]  that may be not true sure he might agree he might not agree but what it what what they said was was
[10702.44 --> 10707.40]  free speech it was free speech and so you can't just be like no i don't like that free speech and
[10707.40 --> 10714.92]  try to sue them to not say it i will say that's not what the you can't be a free speech absolutist if
[10714.92 --> 10723.00]  you are gonna selectively yeah it's not how it works yeah i um yeah i always hated twitter i will
[10723.00 --> 10731.00]  absolutely admit it is more useless now than like ever it is still up a ton of people were saying it was
[10731.00 --> 10735.16]  gonna go down and i was like i don't think so and i got a lot of hate for that and it's still up so it
[10735.16 --> 10741.32]  is still up screw you guys yeah but um it is definitely more useless the amount of like
[10742.04 --> 10748.04]  i i think there's more spam now i have no scientific reason to think this there is but it sure as heck
[10748.04 --> 10754.84]  feels like it so much spam oh my god i can't even it's like over man when i when i click a trending
[10754.84 --> 10760.68]  topic it's hard for me to even find out why it's trending sometimes okay i felt that before the
[10760.68 --> 10767.08]  buyout i never had that problem interesting usually the first 20 or so were relevant enough
[10767.08 --> 10774.68]  and had enough likes that i could i could tell you know is it are they dead is it pedophilia you know
[10774.68 --> 10780.28]  like like what is it why why are they trending you know yeah now i will click on something and i'm
[10780.28 --> 10786.92]  actually not sure for and sometimes i will even go as far as just giving up and googling name
[10786.92 --> 10792.60]  controversy to find out what the heck is going on it's it's pretty i i definitely use it less than i
[10792.60 --> 10801.72]  ever have yeah yeah and i and i and i don't that's true for me as well and i don't even really think
[10801.72 --> 10808.68]  i'm using it less because like musk bought it i'm just using it less because like yeah well you've
[10808.68 --> 10815.32]  made your position very clear yeah always considered it a dumpster fire i still need to use it for dms
[10815.32 --> 10819.72]  yeah so i'm still on it a little bit but i think my i think my app limit right now is like
[10819.72 --> 10824.76]  three minutes or five minutes or something like it's really short but realistically you're objectively
[10824.76 --> 10833.00]  wrong because even a trash tier crappier clone of it is worth eight billion dollars so you've
[10833.00 --> 10841.88]  clearly missed something here oh man yeah that's okay the purchase price for twitter that's all right
[10841.88 --> 10848.44]  was a bargain based on the value of truth social that's a that's a that's a really interesting
[10848.44 --> 10855.24]  take actually what did he pay 44 million it was it was 40 something he should write the art of the deal
[10855.24 --> 10866.28]  yeah yeah incredible deal absolutely incredible yeah the best deal um hey a co-authored book
[10867.08 --> 10873.32]  between musk and trump on making there's no way they'd be able to agree on whose name goes first on the
[10874.68 --> 10881.24]  please oh man it's like it's like it's one of those reflective ones where you have to like look at
[10881.24 --> 10884.68]  it the right way to have the name show up but then they find who gets to be the one on the right yeah
[10885.24 --> 10886.76]  he stole my joke
[10886.76 --> 10897.72]  and that's why my name would go first oh man that was pretty funny oh terrible i i love that joke i
[10897.72 --> 10900.92]  don't know if it landed with the audience but i thought it was hilarious i think you did great
[10900.92 --> 10906.92]  thanks it was pretty funny uh we have a good pivot i can't find the topic though the uh google seo thing
[10908.04 --> 10913.56]  oh wow this is a huge topic how did it take us this long to get to it house fresh by the way
[10913.56 --> 10918.44]  i've never heard of this website before me neither potentially because google's squashing it
[10919.00 --> 10924.52]  this is a very well written article and this i i know i read some other stuff on the site it seems
[10924.52 --> 10930.84]  great cool i'd like actually like want to use this site yep so hopefully you guys find it interesting
[10930.84 --> 10935.88]  too yeah this write-up is fantastic it's really long we're not going to be able to cover it all you
[10935.88 --> 10942.36]  should go to the website housefresh.com this particular one is david versus digital goliaths yeah yeah
[10942.36 --> 10948.44]  incredibly well written but we'll give you the kind of the the summary that is going to tell you enough
[10949.24 --> 10955.40]  to make you want to go read the article and find out how you are being misled this is something that i
[10955.88 --> 10962.44]  have been aware of for a long time it's something that i am aware is getting worse it's was the major
[10963.40 --> 10970.76]  major motivator that made me ultimately say okay we need to build a testing lab yeah so clearly it's
[10970.76 --> 10976.84]  something that i believe in very strongly but hearing someone else express it way better than i
[10976.84 --> 10982.84]  could dive really far into the intricacies of like how and and patterns and all this other type of
[10982.84 --> 10989.80]  stuff how product testing is dying yeah and why um and like being stomped on its head while it's being
[10989.80 --> 10996.12]  buried at the same so house fresh a product review site that focuses on air purifiers has published a an
[10996.12 --> 11003.64]  incredible analysis on how a small set of large media publishers are gaming google search by flooding
[11003.64 --> 11009.88]  the web with lazy listicles that recommend products that they have never even touched it's it's lazy
[11009.88 --> 11015.40]  listicles is fun alliteration i would go as far as to say it's basically fraud according to house fresh
[11015.40 --> 11021.64]  these articles are all extremely similar to one another at least in part because they are all entirely
[11021.64 --> 11027.64]  based on amazon listing information and marketing materials put out by the manufacturers these articles
[11027.64 --> 11035.40]  are branded under well-known seemingly reputable names like buzzfeed forbes popular science and rolling stone
[11036.04 --> 11041.08]  but they are sharply lower in quality and effort than most of their other articles the point where it can
[11041.08 --> 11048.12]  be kind of jarring actually and they and they they talk through how this happened with large um
[11048.12 --> 11054.28]  um hold on a second yeah with large media publishers acquiring the rights to these names
[11054.84 --> 11060.52]  and then leaving only skeleton crews in place to continue publishing a little bit of good stuff to
[11060.52 --> 11068.76]  keep the reputation going while just lazily dumping garbage affiliate revenue maximizing crap down people's
[11068.76 --> 11074.76]  throats while house fresh says that google's product review updates generally improve the ranking of
[11074.76 --> 11079.48]  articles that actually provide independent information and thorough research consumers looking to make
[11079.48 --> 11085.00]  an educated purchase are still having to wade through countless reviews from people who have never even
[11085.00 --> 11091.08]  seen the thing in person and this is absolutely something that i've experienced but something that
[11091.08 --> 11097.56]  i didn't dig deep enough to understand just how broken it is like there's this one air purifier that they
[11097.56 --> 11107.16]  kind of go into in the article because they tested it and it fundamentally doesn't work and is loud and is expensive
[11109.08 --> 11115.64]  and they're just like they're sitting there going there is no way on this green earth that anybody who knows anything
[11115.64 --> 11123.56]  tested this and recommended it and yet it tops all of these recommendation lists and they basically dug into it and they're like oh
[11123.56 --> 11129.96]  it's because it pays the most affiliate commission and we've talked about this before um remember i figured
[11129.96 --> 11136.52]  out why eighty thousand dollar area rugs exist and it turns out it's because interior designers get paid
[11136.52 --> 11144.44]  a percentage of the total bill well the higher the price the better the listicle commission because it's
[11144.44 --> 11151.72]  percentage based so you're basically being misled to buy a more expensive thing and it's disguised as
[11151.72 --> 11160.12]  editorial content i mean it's one thing if it is an ad and ads an ad a properly disclosed ad like when
[11160.12 --> 11166.52]  miss vicky's paid me to tell you about their zero trans fat low and saturated fat no preservatives
[11167.08 --> 11172.28]  kettle chips uh that's what the style of chips is called right i don't know it doesn't yeah kettle
[11172.28 --> 11177.32]  cooked potato chips okay they didn't sponsor us but the point is when something is clearly disclosed it's an
[11177.32 --> 11183.00]  ad it's clear that these talking points are coming from the manufacturer but these listicles are not
[11183.00 --> 11188.68]  they're not disclosed it's not clear what the relationship is and it seems like editorial content
[11188.68 --> 11194.12]  and some of the people publishing these if they're people at all or writing these rather some of the
[11194.12 --> 11199.72]  people writing these assuming they are people are publishing so many of these that there is just
[11199.72 --> 11204.92]  there is no feasible way that they have ever even laid hands on these products and i've seen it before
[11204.92 --> 11209.96]  i bought windshield wipers for my taekin from one of these listicles that ended up not being compatible
[11209.96 --> 11213.64]  because they never actually tried it yeah i made it compatible
[11217.48 --> 11225.72]  dan's into it he's very into that so much respect so let's go um but they weren't
[11225.72 --> 11234.12]  but like actually though um so yeah you you need to go read it dan can we get this linked in the
[11234.12 --> 11239.24]  description as well this is really really really important this is why we're building the lab
[11239.24 --> 11244.92]  because it is so hard to find good information anymore and they lay out a really convincing and
[11244.92 --> 11251.32]  scary case for why it's going to get so much harder i genuinely don't think there's been
[11251.32 --> 11258.76]  in very many articles maybe even single digit that are like more beneficial to go read instead of just
[11258.76 --> 11263.24]  listen to what we've said there is so much information in this it's actually dense it's
[11263.24 --> 11270.84]  crazy dense with two s's it's really long and it's very dense each individual paragraph is interesting like
[11270.84 --> 11276.04]  actually go read it yep and it actually really matters because
[11276.04 --> 11283.00]  you need to send this to anyone you know who shops online yeah basically or looks for basically
[11283.00 --> 11288.44]  any information because it shows you just how easily gamed the system is and house fresh
[11288.44 --> 11293.80]  doesn't even blame google outright for this yeah it's clear that this is a case where google is in
[11293.80 --> 11298.20]  good faith trying to do the right thing and surface accurate information about that which is interesting
[11298.20 --> 11309.56]  but there's just the avalanche of is just it's burying any nuggets of good information because
[11309.56 --> 11315.40]  and we know this we know this from building the lab testing products properly is really freaking hard
[11316.04 --> 11324.44]  it's a ton of work um i mean oh man uh we showed off the latest draft of power supply circuit internally
[11324.44 --> 11331.08]  and even internally there's a lot of commentary on for example the uh the ai voiceover that we're
[11331.08 --> 11337.72]  using and the kind of um monotonous sort of scripted shots and they're like i don't understand the value
[11337.72 --> 11342.60]  of this and it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa this is completely different from anything we've done in the
[11342.60 --> 11349.24]  past encyclopedia the value is not in the entertainment for this at all it's just that we understand that
[11349.24 --> 11354.28]  consumers are going to look for information in video form even though this really
[11354.28 --> 11358.44]  would be better off as an article and an article will be available but we understand people are
[11358.44 --> 11364.28]  going to be looking for this information in video and if we look at what other similar power supply
[11364.28 --> 11371.32]  focused videos are doing in terms of viewership on youtube our production budget our total budget
[11371.32 --> 11375.40]  for each of these videos would be somewhere between two dollars and sixty dollars
[11376.84 --> 11383.96]  so we're between a rock and a hard place obviously we would love to use humans to do
[11383.96 --> 11388.84]  all of the work and humans are doing a lot of the work humans developed all these processes
[11388.84 --> 11394.84]  humans are testing the power supplies that's that's that's the meat right there that's being done by
[11394.84 --> 11400.76]  skilled humans right we would love to use humans for everything and have a human host and uh have
[11400.76 --> 11406.60]  bespoke editing for every single episode but if i were to tell you okay well your production budget is
[11406.60 --> 11411.40]  nine dollars and i were to pay humans in such a way that we were able to survive on
[11412.12 --> 11420.84]  nine dollars of revenue i'd be a monster i'd be a stop i'd be a monster and then if i say okay well
[11420.84 --> 11427.24]  this is net new work that nobody was doing before and actually creates additional jobs building these
[11427.24 --> 11432.84]  systems and doing all this testing um but this is the way to make it sustainable you tell me i'm a monster
[11432.84 --> 11436.20]  because we're using an ai voiceover and it's like okay well now hold on a second
[11438.04 --> 11443.40]  this is in my opinion a best case scenario for machine learning it just doesn't exist
[11444.20 --> 11449.72]  we're not going to do it without it can't exist yeah that's the thing yeah it's not that it doesn't
[11449.72 --> 11457.40]  it's that it cannot it's not economically viable for us to do this the traditional way that we've done
[11457.40 --> 11461.72]  things and i think uh there is a pretty good point brought up in full point yeah you have an unlimited
[11461.72 --> 11470.52]  budget because it's a tax write-off thank you for that um there are legitimate concerns like that
[11470.52 --> 11475.00]  people have brought up okay well if we're doing it in power supply circuit then could that infect
[11475.00 --> 11483.16]  the other channels um that is i mean that is the last thing i want yeah i don't i it's not like good
[11483.16 --> 11487.56]  you don't want to listen to that ai voice no not at all i mean if we can get to the point where
[11487.56 --> 11492.92]  power supply circuit is averaging 100 000 views and we're taking on that's we're taking on sponsors
[11494.84 --> 11500.76]  hey have faith yeah sure and we're taking on sponsors and we're doing like huge affiliate
[11500.76 --> 11506.84]  revenue through it because people really value the independent testing then yeah let's let's build a
[11506.84 --> 11512.92]  proper channel around it but we have to start somewhere and right now the meat of it is the testing and we
[11512.92 --> 11521.48]  just need a vehicle yeah my only real notable take from it was that i don't think it should be you
[11521.48 --> 11529.80]  personally yeah i um i've seen people feel strongly about it both ways it's about 50 50. interesting
[11530.92 --> 11536.04]  the the feedback that i have received directly the like non-anonymous feedback that i have received which
[11536.04 --> 11545.24]  i will now keep anonymous um but was all in alignment with that but i mean it was a very
[11545.24 --> 11550.68]  small portion of the company as a whole so it's not representative it's both ways uh it as it turns
[11550.68 --> 11556.68]  out and i think that i can't tell because the feedback form itself was anonymous yeah um so i can't
[11556.68 --> 11562.44]  tell it's like good and bad you can't continue the conversation seems like based on the perspectives
[11562.44 --> 11567.08]  like i don't know which individuals responded but it seems like based on the perspectives that the
[11567.08 --> 11574.76]  lines kind of fall between departments um so some departments feel more strongly that like having it
[11574.76 --> 11583.56]  be linus will make it feel less like someone whose job got taken by ai and more like linus didn't have
[11583.56 --> 11589.72]  time that day okay and then on the other side it's look if we're going to be uncanny valley can we at
[11589.72 --> 11594.52]  least just be uncanny valley with someone that is not a real person and it seems like there's
[11595.56 --> 11602.92]  a clean line right down the middle that's really interesting yeah i know uh zenul says i'm confused
[11602.92 --> 11609.80]  ltt isn't using real voices so again you know our budget our production budget for some of these videos
[11609.80 --> 11614.44]  because we don't know what the budget is until we publish it and see how much money comes in right
[11614.44 --> 11620.20]  our budget for these videos based on what dedicated power supply videos are doing right now on youtube
[11620.20 --> 11622.92]  could be as low as two to three dollars no
[11625.64 --> 11630.52]  no there's there it's not even yeah it doesn't make any sense no and we need
[11631.32 --> 11636.36]  we need to get this even really a it's not a business move it's like remultra says you could
[11636.36 --> 11640.04]  not do a video and promote heavily the written article yeah that worked great for written media
[11640.04 --> 11647.88]  over the last 10 years also some people just will not read it yeah even if we're completely ignoring
[11647.88 --> 11651.88]  the business case because these videos are going to make no money but even if we completely ignore
[11651.88 --> 11656.92]  the business case there are people that will not read an article but they will watch a video that is
[11657.72 --> 11663.80]  absolutely a thing yep there's also people that are just never going to leave youtube there's been this
[11663.80 --> 11669.16]  consolidation issue this the the the house fresh article kind of talks about this um and there's been
[11669.16 --> 11673.80]  other people talking about this recently as well where like the internet is turning into a very
[11673.80 --> 11679.96]  small the whole surf the internet and check out all these different websites thing is like dead already
[11679.96 --> 11686.36]  it's become a very very small pool of websites and it's even smaller than you think yeah because a lot
[11686.36 --> 11693.40]  of the websites that you think are separate are actually owned by large publishing let by large publishers
[11693.40 --> 11700.36]  yeah so like it's it's it can be very hard when that's what you've grown up in or that's the
[11700.36 --> 11705.96]  practice that you've gotten used to uh it can be very hard to get people off of that small group of
[11705.96 --> 11709.56]  websites yeah so they're just going to want to stay on youtube or whatever else
[11712.68 --> 11720.36]  uh pfych i don't know fight on on flow plane chat said my my younger siblings search for products
[11720.36 --> 11728.92]  slash restaurants on tick tock so we've already so coming back to the plan to uh to have these videos
[11728.92 --> 11735.96]  ai voiceovered ai edited because the shots are all standardized because a power supply that's why we
[11735.96 --> 11740.52]  started with power supplies because they're all fundamentally the same size and shape yeah with
[11740.52 --> 11748.52]  fundamentally the same physical features yeah so all the shots are going to be along sort of pre-planned
[11748.52 --> 11755.00]  movements and then it is basically cut together with a template and then validated by a human
[11755.00 --> 11761.24]  editor yeah that's it um and so we are already looking at okay can we do a shortened version of
[11761.24 --> 11770.12]  the script that and then just dump it on tick tock dump it on reels dump it on facebook um because i
[11770.12 --> 11776.92]  mean at the very least we want to be able to get real valid information in front of people and i think
[11776.92 --> 11781.72]  that harder than ever there's going to be some compromises that we're going to make along the way but the
[11781.72 --> 11788.44]  mission is a good one and you know what we might find out that this just is completely ineffective and
[11788.44 --> 11792.76]  we've got to take a different approach and we're going to be open to that but we have to start somewhere
[11793.32 --> 11798.68]  in again the non-anonymous feedback that i received that i will now forward as anonymous feedback
[11798.68 --> 11806.28]  um the people that i talked to would watch it actually but they're not going to watch everything
[11806.28 --> 11811.08]  i i suspect the view counts are going to be really low yeah no they shouldn't watch everything that's
[11811.08 --> 11816.76]  the whole point of this i saw i saw one internal comment yeah i'm sorry to be clear i'm not saying
[11816.76 --> 11821.48]  this to you as if this is a revelation to you i'm more talking publicly i saw one internal comment that
[11821.48 --> 11831.64]  was like this feels like a content farm yes yeah it's supposed to be every power supply ever yeah and
[11832.76 --> 11839.88]  i don't want humans working at the content farm yeah i want humans doing the creative stuff the cool stuff
[11840.60 --> 11849.88]  but we need to have a result when someone searches for this power supply on tick tock and that's the
[11849.88 --> 11858.20]  power supply that blows up or costs twice as much as one that's better we we have to address that and
[11858.20 --> 11865.48]  on a two to sixty dollar budget we aren't going to be doing it with handcrafted human content it's not
[11865.48 --> 11872.60]  going to happen right now and it's not intended to be like like popcorn viewing yeah it's not supposed
[11872.60 --> 11878.20]  to be entertaining this objective this is for the bottom of the funnel where you have you are aware of
[11878.20 --> 11885.32]  computers and you have an intent to learn about computers and you've decided to buy one and you
[11885.32 --> 11890.04]  are choosing a particular component and you want to learn about it or it's been recommended to you
[11890.04 --> 11894.68]  like say you go to pc park picker and you pick one of the recommended builds and you're like i've never
[11894.68 --> 11898.44]  heard of this power supply before you look at one of the videos you're like oh yeah okay it's cool
[11898.44 --> 11903.48]  now you have the confidence when buying the thing and that's good kind of like what i think it was uh
[11903.48 --> 11909.96]  casey neistat said about the vision pro that this is the worst vision pro so the first video we upload
[11909.96 --> 11916.52]  will be the worst video you know in terms of the uncanny valley of the ai voiceover in terms of the
[11916.52 --> 11923.40]  choreography of the shots um it's gonna it's gonna take time yeah it's gonna take time
[11923.40 --> 11933.40]  black smoke rises says it sounds kind of lame but i see the plan yes it's not supposed to be super
[11933.40 --> 11939.64]  exciting content it's not it's supposed to by design it's supposed to be what we could make for under
[11939.64 --> 11946.92]  sixty dollars and remember it's not even under sixty dollars by the time lucas tests a power supply
[11946.92 --> 11955.00]  we are underwater on a sixty dollar budget very significantly so it is are you are you
[11955.00 --> 11960.92]  counting effectively a negative budget don't even worry about the the human time are you counting the
[11960.92 --> 11967.48]  the like time on that machine oh no exactly just do the time on the machine i forget how much that
[11967.48 --> 11972.52]  thing even costs but yeah and then you have to get updates to it oh no i'm not factoring hey don't
[11972.52 --> 11976.84]  forget about the square footage that that whole setup with the environmental chamber don't forget
[11976.84 --> 11981.24]  about the environmental chamber literally just the space it doesn't just run off of the chroma
[11981.80 --> 11987.08]  other cooling it in space yeah yeah floor space oh my god don't forget we're gonna have to buy a
[11987.08 --> 11993.32]  lot of these power supplies if you owned a parking lot how much more profitable so much more like your
[11993.32 --> 12002.28]  roi on one parking stall yeah 20 years like that's the thing guys you gotta try to
[12002.28 --> 12009.64]  try to look at what we're doing and see the bigger picture here this is not isn't a business move no
[12009.64 --> 12015.56]  this is not a profit-taking endeavor if we can turn it into something profitable we will if we can take
[12015.56 --> 12021.72]  this data and we can find nuggets that turn into ltd videos that we can get sponsors of course we're
[12021.72 --> 12025.96]  gonna do that it's gonna feed into the businesses that make money that would happen if we made the
[12025.96 --> 12031.96]  videos or not guys the intent here is we understand this is gonna take time but we are trying to build
[12031.96 --> 12040.04]  something we're gonna make some mistakes it's gonna take some time we're gonna have to learn some things
[12040.04 --> 12046.60]  but that's that's part of the journey right like if we i mean i can't help myself
[12046.60 --> 12056.04]  you gotta dream big you know you gotta dream big i i heard there was uh i tried to invite you to i
[12056.04 --> 12060.04]  think you accepted it whatever doesn't matter but i i went to invite you to a meeting next week to talk
[12060.04 --> 12065.88]  about like the launch of the labs website um and i genuinely don't remember who but someone told me that
[12065.88 --> 12072.36]  like in you had talked about it with them at some point in time and you're all excited about like what
[12072.36 --> 12077.64]  we can do next and i was like yeah they're like what do you mean i was like is this just this is
[12077.64 --> 12087.56]  how it works it's that's good you know but like i would be more stunned if you were like this is the
[12087.56 --> 12097.32]  end i have no more ideas i'd be like oh no oh yeah what happened oh dude my idea doc is is uh
[12097.32 --> 12100.68]  extensive yeah girthy bulging
[12103.56 --> 12108.44]  all right uh merch messages next time yeah we have a lot of next topics do we have super checks
[12108.44 --> 12115.32]  after party today i'm never gonna get to go home am i uh we can we can set it up i mean the home's
[12115.32 --> 12120.52]  overrated uh uh if you want we can uh we can get that going do you want me to do that i don't know
[12120.52 --> 12124.20]  it's up to the float plane people i'll tell you what you can uh you can see if they care that much
[12124.20 --> 12132.04]  this week i probably shouldn't do many oh okay because i have to shift relieve oh yeah okay no
[12132.04 --> 12137.96]  maybe maybe no no checks i could do like maybe three yeah but that's that's a lot to like drag the
[12137.96 --> 12143.48]  whole thing up there yeah no no no sorry sorry i apologize i have sick birds at home yeah luke's got
[12143.48 --> 12151.16]  luke's got bird babies to to to take care of yeah all right dan hit us uh sure let's see to be clear
[12151.16 --> 12155.80]  you're still not off the hook on playing yeah i just i had already planned to tell you like i gotta
[12155.80 --> 12160.04]  stop at three yeah yeah so i don't know you probably shouldn't do the whole setup it's all good yeah
[12161.72 --> 12167.08]  greetings ldl i have troubles for getting my point across whenever there's a collaborative
[12167.08 --> 12172.28]  discussion between me and 10 other people in the group any advice for a timidly shy person like me
[12172.28 --> 12181.08]  um this is a tough one you're asking the wrong two people i don't know about dan so much but um yeah
[12181.08 --> 12186.68]  i'm actually pretty timid yeah maybe dan could uh field this one i was hoping that you guys could
[12186.68 --> 12195.16]  tell me uh i don't know you just yell over them okay i have an idea you turn them off yeah you just turn
[12195.16 --> 12199.80]  off their camera and they're gone yeah exactly they don't exist anymore just leave just leave he doesn't
[12199.80 --> 12204.44]  exactly he's still talking somehow how's this working i don't get it i turned him off he's still
[12204.44 --> 12209.72]  there's a ghost in the machine he's still talking uh something something that i've seen people do that
[12209.72 --> 12214.28]  i think has actually worked pretty effectively and also helps if you have you know an issue with public
[12214.28 --> 12223.00]  speaking is to present your idea in some form that is like textual or through a photograph or a chart
[12223.00 --> 12227.96]  or whatever and then paste it into the chat that everyone's using yeah i was gonna say take notes
[12227.96 --> 12233.40]  and if you need some time to process and collect your thoughts you can always send it as a follow
[12233.40 --> 12238.44]  up hey during the meeting uh these are some thoughts that i had uh or these are some thoughts i had after
[12238.44 --> 12244.36]  the meeting if it makes you uncomfortable to to to to talk about how you know you you need time to
[12244.36 --> 12249.08]  process because not everyone wants to like just say that yeah i kind of you know i'm a thorough thinker
[12249.08 --> 12253.88]  but i'm a bit of a slower thinker you know one wants to say that out loud so you just yeah you
[12253.88 --> 12260.52]  you can you can take some of um some of that pressure off by not necessarily trying to address
[12260.52 --> 12265.56]  it right in the middle of the meeting i understand that that's not always perfect because sometimes
[12266.28 --> 12270.12]  things will hit an inflection point decisions are made and you can either
[12271.88 --> 12275.56]  you know steer it in the right direction or allow it to veer off course and
[12277.16 --> 12282.68]  it can be tough i i find if you can get something that draws everyone's direct attention that they have
[12282.68 --> 12288.44]  to like you know read or look at for a second to fully absorb you can actually get everyone
[12288.44 --> 12292.36]  thinking about that thing for a second and then hopefully you can talk through it or just by looking
[12292.36 --> 12297.80]  at whatever thing you delivered whether it's a chart or a graph or a thing of writing or whatever
[12297.80 --> 12302.20]  hopefully they can get a point from it and then go from there um it's not a perfect solution but
[12302.20 --> 12309.48]  i've seen it used and i think it works pretty well hello guys do you think the ps portal was a
[12309.48 --> 12315.00]  success i've been trying sorry i've been trying to get one but they seem to be sold out everywhere
[12315.00 --> 12321.64]  live in a studio with one tv and wife can't sleep with light i don't think it's a matter of whether
[12321.64 --> 12329.32]  we think the ps portal was a success the ps portal was clearly a success it just wasn't for you if you're
[12329.32 --> 12335.48]  someone who doesn't understand why people want the ps portal uh and tulio clearly is one of the people who
[12335.48 --> 12340.84]  does think the ps portal is a good idea and tulio the good news is there's lots of other options
[12340.84 --> 12347.00]  uh with an app you can pretty much replicate the experience of the ps portal uh whether it's on a
[12347.00 --> 12355.64]  tablet or on a phone but you know it won't have a dual sense style controller with smaller joysticks
[12355.64 --> 12361.80]  mind you um so you know that might work for you that might not work for you uh yeah there's no there's
[12361.80 --> 12366.60]  no question ps portal absolutely a success did you see that thing where it was it had been um
[12367.16 --> 12374.36]  it had been hacked to run like emulated games and then uh sony got tipped off by um by someone and
[12374.36 --> 12380.60]  they were able to patch it no that doesn't happen very often yeah yeah anyway huh yeah they disclosed
[12380.60 --> 12384.60]  to sony how they had worked around and uh and gotten it to do that
[12384.60 --> 12396.28]  luke if you had to buy another car what would it be also thanks for uh just the first part okay
[12399.32 --> 12404.28]  i have no idea i think i would know what i would do if it was a new car but i think the chance of me
[12404.28 --> 12410.68]  buying a new car is very low okay well yeah but tell us i think a prius prime they've been doing
[12410.68 --> 12414.84]  really good yeah the new one makes a lot more sense than the old one i really like the whole
[12414.84 --> 12421.00]  plug-in hybrid thing um they actually like look pretty cool which is weird for priuses but they
[12421.00 --> 12427.32]  do look pretty cool um and they they have good stats on them for the whole plug-in hybrid thing um
[12427.32 --> 12432.60]  but yeah i'm not i'm not super into the new car thing so then i have no idea because i don't know
[12432.60 --> 12438.68]  what the use market looks like right now people are upset because it's a prius yeah the new ones are pretty cool
[12441.40 --> 12446.84]  hey i'm the guy who bought half a dozen of the old black hats and got a couple of the pro hats and
[12446.84 --> 12453.40]  recently uh uh got a couple of the pro hats recently and love the lack of button on top
[12453.40 --> 12456.84]  and clasp what other small changes in products did we miss
[12459.16 --> 12467.72]  oh so much uh i i wish we just filmed our product development meetings because there's so many good
[12467.72 --> 12472.76]  creative juices flowing in them and there's so many little details that even we forget
[12472.76 --> 12477.88]  by the time the long road is over and we actually release the product we put up the product page
[12477.88 --> 12481.24]  and we're like how the heck did we not mention this um
[12481.24 --> 12483.96]  um
[12485.80 --> 12491.16]  i don't know am i going to be able to am i going to be able to come up with something uh
[12491.16 --> 12493.88]  uh
[12497.16 --> 12507.24]  oh man we obsessed over the location of the ltt branding on the cable management arches it was
[12507.24 --> 12515.56]  actually i think me who ultimately made the call after we saw the prototypes um because we did
[12515.56 --> 12522.36]  prototype it with an ltt logo here uh and i think it was me who made the final call to say no
[12523.24 --> 12531.00]  uh no visible branding because the reason that this thing exists is for people to obsess over their cables
[12531.00 --> 12535.96]  and as much as we'd love to have our brand all over your stuff because you know brands like that kind
[12535.96 --> 12542.84]  of thing uh it's not the right thing for this product uh so actually i don't think on the product page
[12542.84 --> 12547.08]  you can actually see the ltt branding at all oh you know there it is
[12550.44 --> 12554.04]  so i don't know that's not really a detail you wouldn't have noticed i'm sure you noticed where the
[12554.04 --> 12560.76]  branding was on it but that's the that's the background for why that happened that you probably
[12560.76 --> 12568.04]  didn't realize like how how long these conversations can be sometimes
[12572.20 --> 12577.96]  amazing uh good day uh actually i wasn't sure if you guys talked touched about this with the ai thing
[12577.96 --> 12580.04]  sorry uh-oh ow
[12584.20 --> 12589.72]  what oh oh oh oh wow
[12590.44 --> 12594.52]  did someone point that out or did you just think of it uh someone in full print chat
[12594.52 --> 12596.92]  oh nice completely missed the transition
[12599.96 --> 12600.52]  all right
[12601.80 --> 12607.24]  land show after dark let's go there we go that's better can't remember if we touched on this when
[12607.24 --> 12614.04]  you're talking about ai with ai how do you think about disclosure of use of ai in your content should
[12614.04 --> 12622.12]  there be a consistent policy should we even care as viewers oh i think you should care but you should
[12622.12 --> 12632.28]  care if it affects the quality which it almost certainly will unless humans are hand curating it and
[12632.28 --> 12640.52]  hand reviewing it in which case is it really ai or is it more like disclosing that you used a word processor
[12641.96 --> 12643.08]  then no you shouldn't care
[12643.08 --> 12653.00]  so yes but also no but yes but maybe no uh we don't weird we don't have a policy right now it's a really good point
[12653.00 --> 12660.68]  um because i think everything that we've used it for that's public facing has been
[12661.80 --> 12667.80]  very clearly machine learning like the uh i showed you guys a preview of what power supply circuit's
[12667.80 --> 12675.00]  going to look like it's machine learning up the butt um definitely not attempting to hide it in any way
[12675.56 --> 12685.32]  yeah i mean oh i mean okay hold on no we uh we did we did um actually use an llm prompt to
[12686.68 --> 12693.56]  get some starting points for the smash champs logo i think or we at some point we we got some some
[12693.56 --> 12698.84]  drafts and then we did a prompt and then we got some ideas and we came to the final one so it was
[12698.84 --> 12706.92]  very human done but ai was used as a tool as a tool i mean i've done ai idea generation stuff for
[12706.92 --> 12711.00]  tons of things like how would we even disclose that like we launched a new feature on floatplane
[12711.00 --> 12717.00]  it's like do we disclose that ai was used as a troubleshooting tool for some codes that like
[12717.00 --> 12721.72]  software developers have been all over this for for years yeah so i don't really know man i i use it
[12721.72 --> 12726.68]  for sometimes i'll not even i wouldn't even necessarily say writer's block but sometimes
[12726.68 --> 12733.08]  i find starting an email to take me too long and it's like frustrating i'm like i have to respond to
[12733.08 --> 12738.76]  like a hundred emails today so like i just i need something to get me going or like this is a long
[12738.76 --> 12745.24]  message i have a lot of information to convey i need to get them to actually read the thing in the
[12745.24 --> 12751.16]  first bit and i'll yeah i'll use chat gbd or whatever to help me start the writing but i never really
[12751.72 --> 12758.20]  send actually chat gbd written things so what does that mean i don't know
[12761.48 --> 12769.56]  i dinas duke lan and lavid how much of dinas's little ones remember the langley house i doubt
[12769.56 --> 12772.68]  they remember it at all i would suspect yeah not at all
[12772.68 --> 12782.04]  sorry i gotta find another one of these sorry go for it look i was gonna say didn't most of them
[12782.04 --> 12787.80]  not exist i'm trying to think of the timeline i think only one of them didn't exist at all okay
[12787.80 --> 12788.84]  during that time yeah yeah
[12791.56 --> 12798.28]  hi lld good morning from taiwan compute tax is coming up any taiwanese food or places you're
[12798.28 --> 12803.48]  definitely gonna have to go yeah give me some soup dumplings oh that'll sound nice so good
[12803.48 --> 12807.88]  do that get some taiwanese style fried chicken that place we were going to get soup last year was
[12807.88 --> 12811.80]  awesome weren't there like three different nights or something oh yeah i don't even remember damn
[12811.80 --> 12816.84]  i'm sure we could find it it's gonna be in my google uh timeline yeah i have like super creepy
[12816.84 --> 12824.92]  location tracking on and the the only real reason that i do is because i just like curiously going back
[12824.92 --> 12830.76]  and seeing where i've gone like my my google maps location history is hilarious because like
[12831.48 --> 12838.68]  there was a few years there where i was oh boy was i ever traveling a lot uh check check this out
[12841.08 --> 12846.52]  give it a sec uh hold on here hold on cities
[12846.52 --> 12850.68]  oh boy oh boy
[12854.28 --> 12855.56]  red dots everywhere
[12857.40 --> 12860.04]  yeah everywhere as long as it's in the northern hemisphere
[12860.04 --> 12863.80]  i realized i have never been to the southern hemisphere yeah
[12865.40 --> 12868.52]  yeah typical north east they never think about the south
[12870.20 --> 12874.04]  where did that accent come from i don't know nowhere in particular
[12874.04 --> 12880.52]  okay hey luke what's your oh no oh god i'm sorry i'm almost ready
[12881.32 --> 12888.36]  uh oh crap there's two places that i really want to go this year sun moon lake and another one
[12888.92 --> 12892.68]  that i'm struggling to remember the name of uh ju fen
[12893.24 --> 12897.40]  i'm surprised you're not going to like the eclipse or whatever that seems like totally up your alley i
[12897.40 --> 12904.44]  wanted to actually yeah i know i couldn't go right now all right yeah bummer that's okay
[12906.92 --> 12908.20]  i've gone to eclipses in the past
[12910.20 --> 12914.44]  it is what it is i there's a couple people on the labs team going i was like take me nice pictures
[12915.48 --> 12919.96]  and dan siegel i have already seen very nice pictures taken by him so i trust
[12919.96 --> 12927.08]  all right he'll get it done i believe sorry what do you say hey luke what's your rarest pokemon go
[12927.08 --> 12936.20]  finds in your connection uh collection uh i don't know i assume it's pokemon go yeah yeah pogo is
[12936.20 --> 12944.36]  pokemon go yeah yeah um probably shiny pachirisu but i don't really care
[12944.36 --> 12953.88]  linus and luke if you were to wake up in a freaky friday situation what would be your first actions
[12953.88 --> 12967.32]  as each other okay moving on it's not that after dark
[12967.32 --> 12977.88]  you'd have to check check to make sure that the birds are okay that's what he's talking about
[12977.88 --> 12985.56]  yeah yeah the birds are very important yeah yeah um yeah yeah yeah yeah
[12987.48 --> 12994.68]  unplug all of the unify cameras i would i would jump off of something not not too high but relatively
[12994.68 --> 13000.04]  high to get some gravity in me and see what the impact is like weighing that much you mean that
[13000.04 --> 13004.68]  little that little yeah but it's gonna be a way bigger fall i've i've weighed twice as much as linus
[13004.68 --> 13011.96]  for like you know what quite but i go somewhere where there's lots of short people i was over in japan
[13012.68 --> 13018.60]  and like i realized that that whole experience that people talk about where it's like just like
[13018.60 --> 13022.36]  being taller than everyone else well i've never had that you know what i would have the being
[13022.36 --> 13029.48]  taller than everyone else experience okay yeah that's what i would do i mean that would require
[13029.48 --> 13036.52]  some planning would that be the very first thing i would do probably not i don't i feel like a lot of
[13036.52 --> 13042.20]  what i would do wouldn't be that different yeah like i don't really see how being luke would actually
[13042.20 --> 13051.64]  change my lifestyle a ton we do a lot of maybe not the same thing but very related yeah
[13052.84 --> 13059.72]  lion says badminton i work out yeah man i would hate dragging your gigantic ass around on the court
[13059.72 --> 13064.04]  this is why i was saying yeah the first thing i would do is jump basically i would suck because i
[13064.04 --> 13071.40]  i'll just be like wow yeah you'd be older though yeah it's not that much older yep
[13073.08 --> 13075.56]  would your wife consider it we will not be discussing that
[13077.08 --> 13079.96]  would you sit on uh opposite sides of the wand table
[13081.88 --> 13085.56]  that would probably feel the most wrong no no
[13085.56 --> 13094.20]  i don't even think i could do the show seeing colors differently and like yeah tasting things
[13094.20 --> 13096.92]  differently and stuff would would definitely be a lot more jarring yeah
[13098.84 --> 13109.16]  um yeah i don't know i don't know i definitely do something really embarrassing as him because being a
[13109.16 --> 13112.84]  public figure i kind of like i have to be on my best behavior all the time
[13112.84 --> 13116.92]  and yeah he's a public figure too but i don't give a because it's him
[13119.40 --> 13122.60]  so i do something like really weird like streak in the park or something you know
[13123.32 --> 13129.88]  nice yeah have we gone streaking no nice i'm i'm far too conservative and shy
[13130.68 --> 13139.00]  yep i uh actually it's it's funny like i play a very outgoing character on tv but i am
[13139.00 --> 13149.48]  like not on tv yeah yeah when i'm i'm actually pretty withdrawn when i'm not on tv yeah um like
[13149.48 --> 13151.96]  be being outgoing and uh
[13156.12 --> 13162.12]  like doing an underwear shoot for me very uncomfortable and challenging especially the
[13162.12 --> 13168.68]  first time like i have to push myself for a lot of what i do here here here's a question if you
[13168.68 --> 13176.60]  had if there was the option yeah for like 24 hours would you do it yes or no i would immediately no
[13176.60 --> 13183.48]  question i feel like i would for like pretty much anyone though yeah i just think it'd be such a such
[13183.48 --> 13189.16]  an interesting experience it'd be a freaky friday that's for sure yeah even even even just the like
[13189.16 --> 13194.76]  vision though i mean be really interesting yeah your downgraded ass vision probably wouldn't
[13194.76 --> 13199.80]  oh yeah you'd get wrecked great for me but even just like the color shift of it i'm still over 2020
[13199.80 --> 13204.92]  baby i just got my eyes checked nice yeah definitely not there's a matter it's a matter of time for me
[13204.92 --> 13212.12]  though it's it's it's not like as good as it was i think that's pretty normal yeah um seeing things
[13212.12 --> 13215.64]  differently hearing things differently tasting things differently experiencing things differently
[13215.64 --> 13219.96]  in general i think just seem to be so interesting you know what's funny is we've talked about this
[13219.96 --> 13230.52]  before but it's been in the context of substance use and what i have said before because i've i've
[13230.52 --> 13235.72]  not with you at this particular from this particular perspective but i've had the argument made to me
[13235.72 --> 13242.12]  that it can be good for broadening your perspectives and uh and helping you experience things in a in a
[13242.12 --> 13253.32]  new way and sort of what i've what i've said is that i tend to be um quite controlling of my experiences
[13253.32 --> 13264.60]  and i tend to i tend to be um i tend to like to be in control of myself yeah and this would be me
[13264.60 --> 13271.80]  literally not being in control of myself at all honestly i have it's a big ass i have considered the
[13272.84 --> 13279.48]  ramifications of what the other person would do practically not at all so yeah that might change
[13279.48 --> 13285.40]  my mind a little bit i'm just like i'm thinking like to be clear just my own shift if it was you
[13285.40 --> 13291.64]  if it was if it was you and this was a consensual body switch that's probably why i wasn't really
[13291.64 --> 13296.20]  thinking about it it's because i'm not too worried about then that's one thing right but if you were just
[13296.20 --> 13303.72]  like partners right yeah yeah leave it alone yeah exactly but i i feel like most of the like
[13303.72 --> 13308.92]  ground rule thing like yes we should lay them out but that's also not really the point of freaky
[13308.92 --> 13313.64]  friday necessarily that's true it's part of the point is you're our i think that's another reason
[13313.64 --> 13317.88]  why i'm okay with it though is because i don't think we would have to actually have to establish
[13317.88 --> 13321.96]  those yeah like i wouldn't be worried about getting my body back with diseases you know like it's not
[13321.96 --> 13329.08]  it's not like that yeah um but i i i would literally not be in control of myself which is something that i
[13329.08 --> 13335.64]  am deeply unsettled by so it's not an obvious yes to me it's something i'd have to i'd have to
[13335.64 --> 13340.60]  fester on for a little bit i wouldn't be too worried about it you bruise me up a little bit
[13340.60 --> 13346.04]  it's fine because there's there's got to be if if it were to happen the first few minutes have got
[13346.04 --> 13350.52]  to be just pure chaos i would think so yeah i wouldn't even be able to walk yeah like it's
[13350.52 --> 13355.40]  going to be like what's going on and when i and when i like accidentally hit something it like damages it
[13356.12 --> 13361.24]  you know feel like an ogre no offense you would probably though
[13361.24 --> 13368.36]  you'd be like this sucks like looking up at people when they're talking to you i have noticed
[13368.36 --> 13374.12]  somewhat of a pattern is that i find smaller people are more clumsy and my conclusion is that i think
[13374.12 --> 13379.08]  it's because it matters less yeah the consequences are like yeah like what i fall over i'm so close to
[13379.08 --> 13390.52]  the ground anyway like the impact is pretty low you know yeah yeah anyways hi big luke
[13391.16 --> 13397.56]  have you tried hold on willing spy says oh no you'll have to go to the bathroom eventually
[13399.72 --> 13402.04]  yeah but yeah we sit down anyway i don't have to look
[13405.48 --> 13411.56]  you'd have to you'd have to experience it oh yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah no but like actually
[13411.56 --> 13415.96]  mechanically oh my god no i don't want to go to the washroom i don't think i'd have to do that
[13415.96 --> 13425.08]  anyways have you tried a virtual challenge such as the conqueror on your fitness journey my
[13425.08 --> 13429.72]  girlfriend just started routinely exercising and virtual challenges have really kept her going
[13429.72 --> 13434.12]  oh i don't really want to say
[13437.08 --> 13444.60]  no i have not and if it's working for them that's absolutely fantastic and they should keep doing it
[13444.60 --> 13451.24]  and that's great to me i'm a big hater looks like a massive cash grab
[13454.76 --> 13463.40]  you all challenges they have like themed ones but they all they all cost money do they yeah you get
[13463.40 --> 13470.20]  this cool metal thing at the end okay so like if your little goblin collector brain is motivated enough
[13470.20 --> 13479.64]  by that to go out and do stuff great sure yeah but like go for it pokemon go pokemon go doesn't even
[13479.64 --> 13486.68]  me doesn't even work for most people yeah but but what i'm saying is like like i i don't i'm not into
[13486.68 --> 13492.84]  this i it looks like a cash grab to me personally um all that stuff but if it works for them great
[13492.84 --> 13498.92]  you saw what happened when we launched our series four pins yeah so some people is sold out some
[13498.92 --> 13503.56]  people might be super motivated by this and if this motivates you to get up and go out for runs and do
[13503.56 --> 13508.60]  stuff like that that's awesome it wouldn't really work for me and it's an expense so you might guess
[13508.60 --> 13511.40]  how i'm gonna feel about it um okay
[13513.40 --> 13515.96]  but it costs more than zero dollars yeah
[13515.96 --> 13525.96]  so i i genuinely don't want to trash it because if it's working for you then awesome but
[13527.80 --> 13529.00]  yeah i don't know
[13531.24 --> 13539.16]  it is what it is question for slick i have recently transitioned from ic to em for a newly minted team
[13539.88 --> 13545.08]  uh individual contributor to engineering manager yeah i googled them earlier but i can't remember
[13545.08 --> 13550.84]  uh and i'm experiencing some trepidation about the shift any advice or reference material you found
[13550.84 --> 13553.56]  helpful uh reference material
[13555.80 --> 13557.56]  most of what i learned about it is from wendell
[13559.56 --> 13565.64]  uh i don't think he talks about that stuff a ton on his channels um the mythical man month is a cool
[13565.64 --> 13572.76]  book a bit of an outdated title but it's a cool book um other than that there's tons of books
[13572.76 --> 13578.52]  books i read a bunch of books i'm still reading books every now and then on the topic um for the
[13578.52 --> 13585.16]  most part honestly though you'll be fine just care about your team and you'll be fine this is great
[13585.16 --> 13591.08]  trendy says sitting down to pee is a prison thing and uh d me's got my back here it's a tired in the
[13591.08 --> 13594.36]  middle of the night and not wanting to turn on lights or clean up a mess thing
[13594.36 --> 13605.16]  100 i also uh i also find that the other way is pretty unsanitary because even if you don't hit the
[13605.16 --> 13612.68]  seat the splashback is very significant oh yeah yeah yeah completely agree also i often go in pairs
[13613.88 --> 13617.48]  to the bathroom like number one and two
[13617.48 --> 13625.08]  i often go in pairs so like it's just inefficient yeah because i'm gonna end up sitting down anyways
[13625.08 --> 13631.88]  like what was the point of that whole charade i don't know it's also one of the few times that i
[13631.88 --> 13637.40]  can get uninterrupted time on my phone yeah like just there's a lot of factors dude yeah there's a lot
[13637.40 --> 13643.88]  of factors relax yeah i i stay a while yeah to be clear i was joking that i always sit down but i actually
[13643.88 --> 13651.48]  do quite often because it's just like yeah man i'm just like i'm chilling in here and i don't need
[13651.48 --> 13657.80]  like pee all over the wall next to my toilet i just actually don't need that it's one of the reasons
[13657.80 --> 13663.88]  bathrooms smell so bad especially men's bathrooms even if the people who use it are accurate the splash
[13663.88 --> 13670.44]  the splash back it's real even even okay even if it doesn't like come out of the bowl you're very
[13670.44 --> 13675.16]  likely splashing the inside of the yeah it splashes the underside so and then it doesn't get washed
[13675.16 --> 13682.12]  away properly i realized this i realized how bad it was when i was giving my uh one of my kids a hard
[13682.12 --> 13689.08]  time and i bet you can imagine which one about like aiming badly and not cleaning up afterward and
[13689.08 --> 13695.88]  realized that actually it wasn't that it was that it was all collecting yeah under yeah and like drying
[13695.88 --> 13702.84]  there and then it dries on and it's gross it just sucks gross it's not worth it i sit down all the
[13702.84 --> 13712.44]  time oh unless i'm if you're at like a public thing yeah i'm not a huge fan of that i'm i'm a like
[13712.44 --> 13720.12]  foot with kicking up the seat touch nothing guy in public washers yeah yeah yeah 100 yeah me too totally
[13720.12 --> 13725.72]  like like but if i'm at home like if it's a particularly gross one i've even been known to
[13725.72 --> 13731.08]  make a little toilet paper seat for myself me too i'm i'm lazy about it have you done the just power
[13731.08 --> 13737.80]  squat don't touch no yeah no i haven't done the power squat i've done that before that can be uh
[13739.08 --> 13745.00]  can we talk about something else now no ah yeah too bad
[13745.00 --> 13753.32]  can you relay to luke that he has a very nice laugh and it is very contagious is this a question
[13754.12 --> 13760.12]  nope thank you though it's funny i i read the comments often i am i read the comments often and
[13760.12 --> 13767.08]  it's so divisive oh yeah some people hate it oh yeah it's and it like no one really seems to be in
[13767.08 --> 13773.88]  the middle people are like like it a lot or i ruin the entire show and their whole lives and they hate me
[13773.88 --> 13781.80]  vegemite you're basically vegemite yeah yeah hey dll luke if you were the chief vision i don't know
[13781.80 --> 13787.40]  chief vision officer at lmg would you have started labs knowing the immediate return on investment and
[13787.40 --> 13795.72]  why yes but not in the same way and i think i've communicated this to linus i don't i'm not exactly
[13795.72 --> 13807.88]  caged about my opinions on things um yeah i don't know i wouldn't have gone as hard as fast um if it
[13807.88 --> 13815.88]  was which i'm not saying this is better to be clear it is what i would have done um but yeah i would have
[13815.88 --> 13822.12]  started with fewer verticals i probably would have started with like just like gpu cpu and potentially
[13822.12 --> 13828.12]  nothing else or even just gpu keep it really narrow figure out all the processes figure out
[13828.12 --> 13831.32]  all the speed bumps that you're going to run into with just that vertical that apply to multiple
[13831.32 --> 13835.96]  other verticals and then start growing from there but kind of like master one and then grow that would
[13835.96 --> 13842.36]  have been a lot slower that would have accomplished the main primary goal that linus has a lot slower um
[13843.16 --> 13848.84]  that wouldn't that would have caused major delays in a lot of different ways um yeah but that is
[13848.84 --> 13853.72]  probably maybe a little bit more expanded than that maybe like it depends kind of who applies
[13853.72 --> 13857.80]  and what special specialties they had maybe it would have been a couple more things maybe it would
[13857.80 --> 13863.96]  have been like gpu and keyboard i don't know um but it would have been fewer total things um probably
[13863.96 --> 13870.44]  kept the original location oh the little one yeah yeah okay but the smaller team would have actually
[13870.44 --> 13875.72]  been okay there's no way that team would not work out of that office you had to get something else oh yeah
[13875.72 --> 13881.40]  but i would have kept the scope scope small and then tried to stay in there that's fair um i mean
[13881.40 --> 13887.64]  the reason we didn't was because there was so much work that was going to have to be done regardless of
[13887.64 --> 13894.68]  how many verticals we tackled like we would still need the website in basically it's exactly as it is
[13894.68 --> 13899.96]  form yeah i'm not i'm genuinely not saying my way is like for sure better and i'm not saying my way is
[13899.96 --> 13905.48]  better either yeah i'm just saying there were there were pros and cons either way and uh there's
[13905.48 --> 13911.24]  definitely been speed bumps that we've hit that we wouldn't have with that method but we might have
[13911.24 --> 13917.32]  hit different speed bumps if you put all your eggs in two baskets and one of them hits a showstopper
[13917.32 --> 13924.36]  now you've got one basket good job you're launching half as many things as you set out to launch it's tough
[13924.36 --> 13929.80]  and this is like the the kind of like riskier way but if you make it the payoff is bigger and faster
[13930.52 --> 13934.76]  so the linus way that is this is often how it will go
[13937.56 --> 13944.68]  and yeah urban fervor says you have to pick a direction eventually yeah yeah that's you're never
[13944.68 --> 13949.56]  going to agree with every single thing that the company that you work for does and that's actually
[13949.56 --> 13954.12]  okay and if that's not okay then you're going to have a lot of problems even i don't agree with
[13954.12 --> 13960.28]  everything the company does yeah it's just it's true it's a thing no exaggeration
[13962.28 --> 13970.68]  idll big fan of y'all luke a few weeks ago you mentioned matter most uh having its own issues as
[13970.68 --> 13976.84]  a service could you elaborate i work for a government organization that plans on using it for secure
[13976.84 --> 13982.84]  messaging oh man it's been a while we tried out matter most quite a while ago um
[13985.96 --> 13990.36]  it's been years since we tried it so i'm not entirely certain if i remember correctly this is
[13990.36 --> 13995.80]  self-hosted if it's been that long it might be i don't want to say too much for us to say too much
[13995.80 --> 14004.04]  about it yeah um i mean maybe maybe hit us up again once you guys have trialed it and let us know if our
[14004.04 --> 14009.16]  perception of it was outdated i would be interested in that take especially because with teams decoupling
[14009.16 --> 14016.44]  it might legitimately be time to reassess the chat solutions market papa daca says uh i use matter most
[14016.44 --> 14022.20]  with my college buddies and it works great so yeah but that's that's one endorsement and that's all
[14022.20 --> 14029.40]  that's worth but um yeah let us know we'd be we'd be happy to to learn more about it the professional
[14029.40 --> 14036.44]  self-hosted plan is ten dollars per user per month billed annually right now wait it's self-hosted
[14036.44 --> 14040.84]  and you pay ten dollars a month well there's a free and there's a self-hosted got it okay um
[14042.04 --> 14046.60]  i believe the self-hosted tier the main difference is things like sso um
[14047.72 --> 14053.40]  ldap user sync advanced access controls things like that that you probably will want in an enterprise
[14053.40 --> 14058.36]  environment right um maybe not for your bros at university but at an enterprise environment
[14058.36 --> 14064.92]  probably so you're likely going to be targeting ten dollars a month there's also a enterprise option
[14064.92 --> 14072.44]  which sounds like it's maybe them hosting it okay um i don't know okay
[14072.44 --> 14077.48]  i'm worth 40k in a bottle of beer nice hell yeah
[14087.08 --> 14087.72]  oh
[14088.28 --> 14094.44]  i can't believe how fast tsmc was back at work yeah it was like hours wild um
[14095.80 --> 14100.20]  yeah i mean obviously having all of your manufacturing consolidated in one place is a
[14100.20 --> 14106.36]  big challenge but i know framework has had um some feelings about having their devices
[14106.36 --> 14111.16]  manufactured in china and they've opted to keep their manufacturing in taiwan at least for now
[14111.80 --> 14118.92]  and um it's risky but hopefully uh hopefully nothing too disastrous like the um the thailand floods that
[14119.48 --> 14126.68]  like almost trashed the hard drive industry for uh for a number of months there um hopefully nothing like
[14126.68 --> 14132.28]  that happens and of course uh hopefully if something like that were to happen uh laptops and hard drives
[14132.28 --> 14136.68]  would be the least of our concerns and we would be more worried about how to help the people
[14138.36 --> 14143.72]  yeah i'm glad you're enjoying your framework seven uh framework 16 though i'm obviously super super
[14143.72 --> 14148.76]  proud of what the team is doing over there not proud because like i helped necessarily but proud
[14148.76 --> 14153.88]  because uh they just seem like really cool people and i'm i'm proud of their efforts they're working
[14153.88 --> 14157.00]  hard and they're doing something they really believe in and i think that's really important
[14157.96 --> 14162.92]  and sorry i was muted for that one it was uh what do you think about the framework and the earthquake
[14164.04 --> 14168.44]  oh yeah and they were enjoying their framework 16 that's right that's right last of the curate i've
[14168.44 --> 14176.60]  got here howdy dl i'm six feet six inches show off 198 centimeters and would love to get your shirts or
[14176.60 --> 14183.72]  flannels because my friends love them so is there an eta even an ltte eta on when you're tall or
[14183.72 --> 14190.76]  big skews start please um this shirt doesn't cover my back it's very comfortable though i think our
[14190.76 --> 14201.32]  next shirt order for the blank tees should have tall sizes can i can i get 50. i will actually i want to
[14201.32 --> 14206.28]  be a cartoon character very likely spending money if that happens because i will legitimately replace my
[14206.28 --> 14213.24]  wardrobe i will also be doing the exact same i will get rid of everything and everything in my wardrobe is
[14213.24 --> 14221.00]  ltd stock they're good shirts so they're great shirts yeah um i don't know do you have a favorite
[14221.00 --> 14223.88]  flower no me neither all right sorry brad f

[14230.68 --> 14237.96]  brad f asked our favorite flowers yeah yeah whatever gets my wife off my back bran bran come on
[14237.96 --> 14244.04]  i don't know whole wheat it sounds like it sounds like a hassle like i'm sorry i have to put water
[14244.04 --> 14253.48]  in it and for what like so it dies slight slightly slower yeah cool like your relationship all right i think
[14253.48 --> 14260.92]  that's it for the show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel hey terry fox foundation bye
