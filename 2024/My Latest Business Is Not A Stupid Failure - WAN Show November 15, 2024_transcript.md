[0.00 --> 5.22]  The WAN Show! We've got a great, great show lined up for you guys today.
[5.22 --> 5.82]  Only the best.
[5.92 --> 18.28]  Only the best show for you guys. I forget what our headline topic is, but Amazon is going to be taking on Sheehan and Temu with a new sub-$20 Amazon haul.
[18.40 --> 24.48]  Also, our headline topic, I am less stupid than some people think I am.
[24.54 --> 24.96]  Yay!
[25.28 --> 26.76]  I didn't say buy much.
[26.88 --> 28.18]  No, I didn't say buy much.
[28.18 --> 28.44]  Oh.
[28.66 --> 29.78]  Yeah, I didn't say buy much.
[29.78 --> 31.42]  Just less. Just less.
[31.80 --> 34.84]  New business, apparently, pretty cool.
[35.06 --> 36.48]  What else we got going on this week?
[36.90 --> 41.56]  If you go to websites on boxes, it might be a good or bad week for you.
[41.62 --> 43.44]  Depends on what you think about certain websites.
[43.86 --> 45.60]  I'm going to leave that as vague as it is.
[45.84 --> 46.50]  The Wicked thing?
[46.78 --> 47.06]  Oh.
[48.14 --> 50.08]  I mean, it's in main news topics.
[50.10 --> 50.90]  I know, but...
[50.90 --> 52.32]  But there's literally only two things...
[52.32 --> 55.66]  Really? We're getting pornographic within the first minute of the show?
[55.66 --> 57.20]  There's only two things in main news topics.
[57.20 --> 58.30]  I told them it was a good show this week.
[58.30 --> 59.66]  I'm going to take both of them, okay?
[59.66 --> 60.92]  I told them it was a good show.
[60.92 --> 62.12]  That's not necessarily bad.
[64.62 --> 65.90]  It's just a news topic.
[65.92 --> 66.46]  Hot take.
[66.64 --> 68.94]  We're not saying the subject matter is good or bad.
[68.96 --> 69.50]  All right, just...
[69.50 --> 70.16]  What else we got?
[70.22 --> 71.34]  Let's get the intro going.
[71.56 --> 71.84]  Jeez.
[72.14 --> 73.16]  And this is...
[73.16 --> 74.82]  This is, I think, objectively bad.
[75.08 --> 78.16]  Sony employees allegedly selling personal data of users.
[79.30 --> 79.74]  Cool.
[79.74 --> 100.08]  Way to go, Luke.
[100.08 --> 100.48]  What?
[100.48 --> 105.48]  The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Ridge, Rocket Money, and of course, our chair
[105.48 --> 110.74]  partner, Secret Lab, our laptop partner, LG, and our rap partner, D Brand.
[111.44 --> 113.34]  Why don't we jump into...
[113.34 --> 114.60]  Not!
[114.60 --> 114.68]  Not!
[114.68 --> 116.44]  Our headline topic.
[116.80 --> 116.82]  Oh.
[117.02 --> 120.68]  And why don't we talk about the channel hiatus stuff from this week?
[121.00 --> 125.32]  Yeah, we should probably get that kicked out as quickly as possible.
[125.52 --> 133.16]  I want to preface this by saying that we will not, and have not, and are not going to be commenting
[133.16 --> 136.94]  on anything to do with personnel changes here at the company.
[137.06 --> 140.52]  That is our policy, and that's the way it's going to be.
[141.28 --> 146.46]  So, with that in mind, then, I've got a small FAQ that I can go through with you guys,
[146.50 --> 148.94]  and that is about all we're going to be able to say about it.
[149.08 --> 149.66]  So, one.
[150.20 --> 150.96]  What happened this week?
[151.52 --> 153.08]  We put three channels on hiatus.
[153.32 --> 155.48]  TechQuickie, GameLinked, and MacAddress.
[156.28 --> 160.96]  For the past year and a half, ever since sort of our week of reflection,
[160.96 --> 165.06]  we've had extensive discussions about ways that we can improve our operations
[165.06 --> 166.68]  and function more smoothly as a company.
[166.96 --> 170.70]  We've spent that time working through operational and communication challenges
[170.70 --> 178.28]  that we've faced realistically since our hyper-growth period from about 2020 to 2022, 2023,
[178.68 --> 180.40]  and even before that.
[181.34 --> 185.22]  We've learned a lot during this time, and we feel that refocusing and refreshing
[185.22 --> 189.84]  is the best path forward for the long-term success of the company and even those channels.
[189.84 --> 193.02]  Two, what do you have planned for these channels?
[194.46 --> 197.80]  The hiatus is to allow our team to evaluate and refocus.
[198.44 --> 201.56]  Three, is LMG becoming evil and corporate?
[202.28 --> 208.84]  And the answer here is, if anything, I think a little bit of corporate responsibility is long overdue.
[209.28 --> 212.94]  Some business management experience was brought in for a good reason.
[212.94 --> 220.10]  I mean, we brought Taryn in to kind of take a look at things so that we would actually have a full-time CEO
[220.10 --> 223.28]  instead of a, like, when-I-have-time-for-it CEO.
[223.54 --> 227.40]  We did all of that before the August controversy last year.
[227.56 --> 228.92]  We did it for a good reason.
[229.48 --> 234.18]  We've allowed unsustainable business practices to carry on for far too long in our past,
[234.18 --> 238.66]  and this has caused significant issues to morale, to growth, to audience sentiment
[238.66 --> 244.66]  that are just, they're unacceptable, and we need to streamline things.
[245.14 --> 249.56]  Number four is, can we give suggestions about what we want to see happen on these channels in the future?
[249.66 --> 251.14]  And the answer is, totally.
[251.76 --> 254.92]  Acceptable places for that would be the linustechtips.com forum.
[255.64 --> 256.08]  We'd love to see-
[256.08 --> 256.74]  It's probably the best one.
[256.74 --> 261.14]  Yeah, we'd love to see your suggestions on the subreddit as well, but it's a little more ephemeral.
[261.46 --> 262.74]  Yeah, harder to deal with.
[262.82 --> 267.46]  A little harder for us to track down in the future, but the LTT forum would be the best part.
[268.48 --> 269.20]  And that's it?
[269.68 --> 271.04]  That's all I have to say about that?
[273.64 --> 274.00]  Yeah.
[274.80 --> 277.74]  Why don't we jump right into-
[277.74 --> 279.76]  Oh, man, what do you want to do?
[280.94 --> 281.30]  Oh.
[282.06 --> 282.42]  Yeah.
[282.66 --> 283.82]  My business isn't stupid.
[283.82 --> 296.56]  David, one of the top comments on just about every video about Smash Champs, the badminton gym slash LAN gaming center, is-
[296.56 --> 300.32]  Is that really, like, is that really a business?
[301.08 --> 302.20]  Like, is that a thing?
[302.56 --> 303.46]  Like, what?
[303.88 --> 309.86]  To be fair, I think you have even said publicly in the past that you don't suspect it's going to be, like, a super profitable endeavor.
[310.12 --> 311.60]  You just kind of want it to pay for itself.
[311.82 --> 312.04]  Yeah.
[312.30 --> 312.76]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[312.76 --> 316.80]  But I had a high degree of confidence that it would do that.
[316.84 --> 317.10]  Yes.
[317.34 --> 322.06]  And it seems like that confidence has not been echoed by members of the community.
[322.22 --> 324.74]  One of the top comments is also that it seems very cheap.
[325.42 --> 326.18]  Ah, well, we'll-
[326.18 --> 326.76]  Is that-
[326.76 --> 327.26]  We'll talk about that.
[327.26 --> 327.68]  We'll talk about that?
[327.68 --> 327.82]  Okay.
[327.86 --> 328.32]  We'll talk about that.
[328.36 --> 332.36]  But first, a quick review of Smash Champs.
[332.76 --> 336.68]  Minus' new badminton facility from Mark Makes Jetlag Games.
[336.78 --> 337.36]  Sorry, what's that now?
[337.70 --> 338.42]  It's not that quick.
[338.80 --> 340.00]  Oh, yeah, it's really not that quick.
[340.00 --> 341.64]  A short summary that you have to scroll through.
[341.84 --> 344.36]  Made the drive today to give it a try.
[344.46 --> 345.62]  My usual spots were full.
[345.74 --> 348.68]  There's a soft opening, so you can register for a drop-in session.
[349.66 --> 351.70]  I booked online and paid with their system.
[352.26 --> 357.88]  I worried based on pictures that parking would be an issue, but the lot was huge, so that was no issue.
[358.22 --> 362.22]  Drop-in was $12, which seems pricey, but you get three hours at prime time.
[362.22 --> 363.46]  And the quartz are-
[363.46 --> 364.26]  It's actually super cheap.
[364.38 --> 365.88]  The quartz are way nicer.
[366.44 --> 368.42]  The videos they posted don't do it justice.
[368.78 --> 370.22]  It's beautiful and bright.
[370.48 --> 372.12]  The change room especially stood out to me.
[372.64 --> 378.16]  The quartz were fantastic, comfortable, bright without lights in your eyes, and easy to see the shuttle in lines.
[378.42 --> 380.46]  I felt like I played a lot better defense than normal.
[380.84 --> 382.16]  This may have had an effect on that.
[382.26 --> 382.68]  Who knows?
[383.06 --> 386.34]  Actually, it's probably more to do with the high ceilings, but we can talk about that some other time.
[387.26 --> 390.72]  Apparently, the delay for opening was some kind of manufacturing defect on the quartz.
[391.62 --> 394.80]  It seems fine, but hey, good job committing to the highest standards.
[395.56 --> 396.62]  And blah, blah, blah.
[396.76 --> 397.78]  How drop-in works.
[397.92 --> 399.18]  The pro shop seemed fine.
[399.26 --> 400.48]  The pricing isn't anything special.
[400.60 --> 401.06]  Yeah, fair enough.
[401.46 --> 403.54]  All in all, I was very impressed.
[404.20 --> 407.12]  I would love to make it a regular location, but it's far from me.
[407.20 --> 408.24]  So, okay, yeah, fair enough.
[409.00 --> 412.06]  Yeah, so that was pretty cool.
[412.20 --> 413.22]  Pretty cool to see.
[413.30 --> 415.66]  We haven't opened up reviews on Google Maps yet.
[415.66 --> 417.50]  I read this whole thing, so I thought it was cool as well.
[417.60 --> 419.32]  Because we're not open yet.
[419.38 --> 420.72]  We're still soft open.
[422.66 --> 426.96]  And I don't think it's really occurred to anyone to leave a review on Facebook.
[428.34 --> 433.88]  But yeah, it's exciting to see it not be totally dunked on.
[434.14 --> 435.80]  I think the team's been working really hard.
[435.80 --> 437.28]  I think they've been doing a really great job.
[437.72 --> 442.36]  And it's worth noting that any comments on pricing, ignore.
[442.36 --> 445.32]  Because this is soft opening pricing.
[445.64 --> 449.32]  And I don't know that it will remain exactly the way that it is in the longer term.
[449.74 --> 449.94]  Yeah.
[452.24 --> 455.10]  Random comment on the, like, I feel like I played defense better thing.
[455.24 --> 460.18]  If you feel like you're in a better environment, you'll often placebo yourself into doing better.
[460.30 --> 462.28]  So, like, that is potentially even a thing.
[462.36 --> 464.40]  Even if we're not accounting for the high ceilings.
[464.40 --> 465.94]  That probably isn't it, though.
[466.30 --> 469.64]  So, most of the centers in Richmond have lower ceilings.
[469.84 --> 472.78]  And the impact that that has on the game is it speeds it up.
[473.00 --> 474.82]  And the reason for that is twofold.
[475.26 --> 483.56]  One is that when you lift up and when you clear, when you hit all the way to the back line, you are hitting lower.
[483.90 --> 487.90]  So, it's a shorter time for the opponent to react and hit it back.
[488.08 --> 489.82]  So, it speeds up the game that way.
[490.06 --> 497.98]  And then the other impact is that it changes the angle of the shuttle so that you are far more likely to strike the cork directly.
[498.10 --> 501.40]  So, you think he was playing better defense because shots were going, like, all the way to the roof?
[501.64 --> 502.16]  Hold on, hold on.
[502.18 --> 502.66]  I'll get to that.
[502.66 --> 507.84]  So, it changes the angle that your racket will impact the shuttle.
[508.02 --> 516.42]  So, you hit the cork first instead of it dropping straight down and hitting the feathers and then the cork, which absorbs some of the power.
[516.86 --> 524.38]  So, what happens is if you have a higher ceiling, people are more likely to hit it up higher, giving you more time to get into position to defend.
[524.90 --> 531.82]  And then the other impact is that it is more likely to be falling straight down, making it more difficult for your opponent to generate power.
[531.98 --> 532.38]  Interesting.
[532.38 --> 540.22]  So, your defense is probably better because you can see better, because you have more time, and because your opponent is having a harder time generating power.
[540.22 --> 547.48]  Now, your opponent having a harder time generating power does not mean that, like, our facility is bad because the ceilings are too high.
[547.62 --> 553.74]  It means the other ones are too low, and people are more easily generating too much power.
[553.74 --> 562.42]  In fact, for international play, you should have a ceiling height of at least 32 feet, which is about, I think it's...
[562.42 --> 563.50]  What is the Smash Names one?
[563.58 --> 563.86]  I forget.
[563.98 --> 564.82]  We're 32 feet.
[565.20 --> 565.32]  Yeah.
[565.86 --> 567.10]  So, yeah.
[567.80 --> 568.32]  Pretty cool.
[569.54 --> 570.36]  Very excited.
[570.36 --> 572.04]  All right.
[572.46 --> 578.76]  I think it's time, though, for us to change the subject to talking about Elijah Week.
[579.24 --> 584.36]  And we have a special guest here on the WAN Show, the one, the only...
[584.36 --> 584.74]  David!
[584.96 --> 585.38]  Yvonne!
[585.70 --> 585.94]  Oh.
[586.20 --> 587.74]  We both went for the same joke.
[589.00 --> 589.36]  Nice.
[589.54 --> 589.96]  Do we...
[589.96 --> 590.26]  Yeah.
[590.48 --> 592.54]  Is there a mic, or am I just supposed to walk on?
[592.54 --> 592.86]  Wait, yeah.
[592.90 --> 593.86]  Does he have a mic, Dan?
[593.96 --> 594.18]  Oh, there he is.
[594.32 --> 594.98]  Holy crap.
[594.98 --> 595.74]  Oh, look at that.
[596.10 --> 597.26]  Soft opening, you say.
[597.50 --> 597.82]  Wow.
[598.48 --> 598.76]  What?
[599.18 --> 599.42]  Really?
[599.42 --> 600.70]  You're saying soft opening about badminton.
[600.84 --> 600.90]  Sorry.
[600.90 --> 601.76]  Yeah, but you're gonna...
[601.76 --> 602.22]  I was just reading the comments.
[602.22 --> 603.24]  It's been six seconds.
[603.30 --> 605.86]  You're gonna make a soft opening while you got this...
[605.86 --> 606.16]  Do you know what?
[606.16 --> 607.04]  Well, you got this in your hand?
[607.06 --> 607.78]  At least use two.
[607.84 --> 608.42]  It's hard.
[610.02 --> 611.02]  One topic's on brand.
[611.16 --> 611.80]  Is his mic on?
[612.46 --> 613.12]  I mean...
[613.12 --> 613.58]  Does it matter?
[613.84 --> 614.68]  It is, but you guys can't hear it.
[614.68 --> 615.12]  Oh, it's on.
[615.14 --> 615.64]  Give me one sec.
[615.94 --> 616.80]  No, that's fine.
[616.96 --> 617.12]  That's fine.
[617.12 --> 618.82]  It's gotta get warmed up.
[618.92 --> 619.62]  Just give him a minute.
[621.46 --> 622.40]  So, what are we...
[622.40 --> 624.92]  We're introing Elijah Week, right?
[624.92 --> 625.72]  We're trying rubbing it.
[625.72 --> 628.20]  No, not the tall Elijah.
[630.38 --> 631.12]  Are you gonna get burns on it?
[631.12 --> 633.56]  I need to talk to Ariana after this.
[633.56 --> 634.42]  You're gonna hate everybody.
[634.92 --> 636.08]  Or everybody's gonna hate you.
[636.14 --> 636.88]  No, they love you.
[636.98 --> 637.58]  No, they don't.
[637.68 --> 639.54]  They'll hate me for telling you not to rub it.
[639.58 --> 641.08]  Actually, did you know the...
[641.08 --> 641.34]  What?
[642.82 --> 645.56]  Did you know the trailer for Elijah Week has the most dislikes?
[646.44 --> 646.66]  What?
[646.70 --> 646.94]  Really?
[647.16 --> 648.26]  Out of all the other trailers.
[648.26 --> 650.34]  Wow, what a polarizing figure he is.
[650.60 --> 652.24]  I think it was because we kind of like...
[652.24 --> 655.02]  Everyone was wanting Sarah Week after she did that pumpkin carving stream.
[655.02 --> 655.44]  There it is.
[655.48 --> 658.86]  And then the next announcement being my week, everyone was like, no.
[659.00 --> 660.38]  So, it's not that you're unpopular.
[660.70 --> 662.44]  It's just that you're less popular.
[662.80 --> 663.16]  Correct.
[663.36 --> 664.02]  All right, cool.
[664.14 --> 664.36]  That's okay.
[665.52 --> 666.04]  So, yeah.
[666.18 --> 666.94]  Elijah Week happened.
[667.14 --> 668.68]  There's three videos up on Floatplane.
[668.86 --> 669.82]  You can go watch right now.
[670.04 --> 670.96]  Oh, it happened.
[671.16 --> 671.72]  Yeah, it already happened.
[671.80 --> 675.30]  Apparently, they're having me after because if I went before, it would probably, you know,
[675.36 --> 676.24]  make people unsubscribe.
[676.24 --> 678.90]  So, they wanted to at least let it finish before.
[679.86 --> 681.82]  But you can meet the team, which is me.
[681.94 --> 682.74]  That's, hi, I'm here.
[683.12 --> 686.32]  There was another one, which was me showcasing my very first script.
[686.82 --> 689.14]  This script, I did not get hired because of.
[689.32 --> 691.52]  I haven't watched this yet, but I want to watch this.
[691.52 --> 692.42]  I saw the upload.
[692.54 --> 693.30]  What do you mean by that?
[693.36 --> 697.68]  So, I applied for the writing position back in late 2021.
[698.46 --> 700.48]  Oh, you didn't work here in late 2021.
[700.48 --> 700.76]  Correct.
[700.98 --> 702.22]  I worked here in 2023.
[702.60 --> 706.98]  So, either I missed the email, like, for a whole year or.
[707.12 --> 707.52]  Yeah, awkward.
[707.78 --> 708.74]  Yeah, it was really bad.
[708.84 --> 709.20]  My bad.
[710.74 --> 712.72]  Okay, just quick interjection.
[712.84 --> 715.10]  I unironically, and if you're out there, sorry.
[715.58 --> 723.68]  I unironically had someone respond to an email from me from 2019, which was progressing them
[723.68 --> 728.04]  to the next stage of the interview process with the things that they needed to give me
[728.04 --> 729.22]  for that step.
[729.22 --> 734.66]  And no note of, like, sorry, this is so many years late or anything.
[734.94 --> 736.24]  Just, here you go.
[736.44 --> 738.08]  And I was like, what?
[739.22 --> 740.32]  I mean, they got your attention.
[740.68 --> 741.26]  That's incredible.
[741.66 --> 743.54]  I'm not hiring that role anymore.
[743.66 --> 744.42]  Yeah, but if you were.
[744.80 --> 746.22]  We have a great person in there.
[746.28 --> 748.30]  I'm very happy with how that person's been doing.
[748.52 --> 751.56]  I just, it's like, it actually blew my mind.
[751.56 --> 756.30]  I sat there looking at it for, like, an embarrassingly long period of time trying to figure out, like,
[756.62 --> 758.12]  did I do something wrong?
[758.12 --> 760.26]  Like, is this actually, am I reading something?
[760.30 --> 761.08]  Is this a newer email?
[761.16 --> 763.34]  It's like you've been married for years.
[763.44 --> 764.56]  You have, like, three children.
[764.56 --> 768.30]  And this, like, guy you asked to prom is like, yo.
[768.62 --> 769.02]  Hey!
[769.22 --> 769.78]  Let's go.
[770.78 --> 772.68]  I am so down to go to prom with you.
[772.74 --> 773.54]  I'm free now, yeah.
[773.54 --> 775.44]  This isn't happening, boy.
[775.48 --> 776.10]  This is over.
[776.58 --> 777.34]  Oh, that's great.
[777.36 --> 777.54]  Sorry.
[777.68 --> 778.94]  And also, you've aged horribly.
[781.72 --> 782.78]  Oh, my God.
[782.86 --> 784.78]  Man, attending the 20-year reunion.
[785.84 --> 791.26]  I gotta tell you, some people, like, man, do they ever, do they ever age on, like, a very
[791.26 --> 792.10]  graceful curve?
[792.10 --> 795.92]  And then, man, some people, it's just like, hit a wall.
[796.20 --> 796.50]  It's a cliff.
[796.50 --> 797.40]  Yeah, that's rough.
[797.54 --> 798.10]  That's rough.
[798.26 --> 800.48]  I'm sorry for you.
[800.54 --> 800.62]  I'm sorry for you.
[800.62 --> 801.96]  My tenure reunion's next year.
[802.16 --> 802.86]  I'm scared to go.
[803.72 --> 804.38]  Are you going?
[804.64 --> 805.32]  Definitely not.
[806.30 --> 807.46]  So he's too cool to go.
[807.56 --> 807.74]  Yeah.
[807.74 --> 808.80]  We discussed this last week.
[808.98 --> 811.02]  I would just, I'd be too famous, you know?
[811.58 --> 811.94]  See?
[812.20 --> 813.22]  This is what I'm talking about.
[813.26 --> 813.72]  Oh, my God.
[813.74 --> 814.48]  That hurt me to say.
[814.52 --> 814.78]  I'm sorry.
[814.78 --> 815.52]  This is what I'm talking about.
[815.52 --> 821.56]  Do you think reunions like that are of diminished value now that we have, like, highly connected
[821.56 --> 822.08]  social media?
[822.20 --> 822.98]  Because I think so.
[823.52 --> 825.12]  Now that, like, Facebook is a thing.
[825.36 --> 826.42]  I don't think, I don't know.
[826.50 --> 830.42]  I've always thought that the idea of reunion from people from high school is useless.
[830.80 --> 833.10]  Because if I wanted to stay friends with you, I would have stayed friends with you.
[833.36 --> 834.20]  Too cool.
[834.48 --> 835.74]  Like, no, I don't know.
[835.82 --> 837.26]  I was friends with no one in high school.
[837.38 --> 839.70]  So, like, why do I want to go back to a bunch of people that bullied me?
[839.82 --> 840.36]  Like, I don't know.
[841.92 --> 843.08]  It's also kind of fair.
[843.14 --> 844.04]  Yeah, you like, I don't know.
[844.04 --> 844.56]  I love it now.
[844.56 --> 845.46]  If that's your experience.
[845.52 --> 846.26]  No, he's above it.
[846.40 --> 846.74]  I am.
[846.84 --> 847.40]  He's risen.
[847.64 --> 848.48]  He's like the cream.
[849.26 --> 850.04]  He's the cream.
[850.34 --> 850.74]  Whoa.
[851.16 --> 851.90]  Soft opening.
[852.16 --> 852.50]  Anyways.
[855.34 --> 858.74]  The last video on Elijah Week was creator versus super fan.
[859.12 --> 860.18]  Cringe, cringe name.
[860.26 --> 861.94]  We both said it was cringe when we started filming.
[862.36 --> 862.56]  Nice.
[862.98 --> 865.78]  Sammy definitely stacked the questions in Linus' favor.
[865.90 --> 866.74]  No, he didn't even.
[866.84 --> 869.32]  But if you haven't gone and watched it, you should still go watch it.
[869.40 --> 869.74]  It's really fun.
[869.74 --> 869.92]  He didn't even.
[870.40 --> 871.88]  I love this look on your face.
[872.50 --> 874.62]  The confidence of you and me being.
[874.62 --> 876.26]  Was this even a posed thumbnail?
[876.90 --> 877.26]  No.
[878.04 --> 878.48]  No.
[879.14 --> 880.10]  Not even a little.
[880.36 --> 882.48]  This feels like it's just a random slide from the video.
[882.56 --> 885.18]  I think all of them are just random slides from the video.
[885.40 --> 888.64]  Are you going to explain what creator versus super fan even is?
[888.64 --> 889.96]  Are you just going to leave them with that?
[889.96 --> 890.20]  I figured out.
[890.32 --> 890.46]  No.
[890.54 --> 895.40]  Basically, what happened was based on the Sam upgrade video we did a couple months ago,
[895.58 --> 902.28]  there was one snippet in that video where Linus mentioned that I have an encyclopedic knowledge of LTT and everything.
[902.92 --> 903.60]  Like our videos.
[903.64 --> 905.10]  I've been surprised by this a few times.
[905.50 --> 906.86]  But it's a thing.
[906.92 --> 907.58]  It's actually like.
[907.58 --> 907.98]  It's a thing.
[908.12 --> 909.04]  James asked me today.
[909.18 --> 909.36]  Yeah.
[909.36 --> 911.14]  And I got an answer.
[911.24 --> 911.80]  Tell you what.
[912.12 --> 912.54]  Tell you what.
[912.58 --> 916.84]  Why don't you come on my podcast and instead of me talking, you talk.
[916.98 --> 917.48]  That sounds good.
[919.00 --> 920.08]  It is Elijah week.
[922.68 --> 923.84]  That's a pretty good point.
[924.12 --> 924.34]  No.
[924.64 --> 924.96]  No.
[924.96 --> 925.24]  I was.
[925.34 --> 925.62]  I was.
[925.70 --> 925.84]  No.
[925.88 --> 926.38]  I was trying to.
[926.42 --> 927.00]  I was trying to.
[927.06 --> 928.10]  I was trying to pump you up.
[928.14 --> 929.42]  I was trying to feel like you're bullying me.
[929.62 --> 929.88]  No, no.
[929.92 --> 930.76]  I was like high school again.
[931.74 --> 932.58]  What's going on?
[932.76 --> 933.34]  What's up?
[933.86 --> 934.88]  Fucking bad about me.
[935.16 --> 935.52]  No.
[935.52 --> 937.32]  No one's talking bad about you, Sammy.
[937.40 --> 937.92]  You're doing great.
[938.34 --> 938.46]  Yeah.
[938.48 --> 939.96]  We're not talking bad about you right now.
[940.04 --> 940.60]  Not right now.
[940.78 --> 941.48]  That was before.
[941.60 --> 942.22]  You're doing great.
[943.06 --> 944.06]  Go watch the fight.
[944.40 --> 944.62]  Okay.
[946.20 --> 946.86]  I'm working.
[947.20 --> 948.94]  Anyway, what I was going to say was.
[949.74 --> 950.54]  Why are you here?
[950.54 --> 956.26]  There's literally been times when we've been looking for like a prop or like a product.
[956.68 --> 961.80]  And Elijah will be like, yeah, there was that video like two years ago where you guys used it.
[961.86 --> 963.76]  And we like go and it's like still there.
[963.76 --> 966.02]  Like that has actually happened.
[966.14 --> 973.50]  So, so his, his knowledge of our videos is actually unsurpassed or at least that was the theory.
[974.14 --> 974.62]  Yes.
[974.82 --> 977.18]  Where, where does your encyclopedic knowledge begin?
[978.36 --> 980.48]  Ooh, I would say Langley house.
[980.66 --> 984.04]  I watched during NCIX days, but I would say.
[984.20 --> 985.24]  I mean, you were like nine.
[985.40 --> 986.02]  Yeah, exactly.
[986.20 --> 991.80]  So I would say that I was, became kind of a hardcore just watching LTT every day when you guys were in the Langley house.
[991.80 --> 996.24]  That was a very based period of time to be watching every day.
[996.32 --> 997.52]  I remember when you guys passed a million.
[998.38 --> 1002.00]  Everyone agrees that the content was better then and has only been downhill since then.
[1002.36 --> 1002.76]  100%.
[1002.76 --> 1003.98]  Whole room water cooling too.
[1004.14 --> 1004.52]  Let's do it.
[1004.72 --> 1007.90]  I mean, who even are these like ancillary characters we have now?
[1008.24 --> 1009.58]  What the fuck is an Elijah?
[1009.90 --> 1012.88]  I remember when in the Langley house, we, we started.
[1013.14 --> 1013.78]  Who is all?
[1013.88 --> 1014.60]  He's a prophet.
[1014.94 --> 1015.50]  For the first time.
[1015.50 --> 1016.54]  And it was like controversial.
[1016.94 --> 1017.72]  We did what?
[1017.76 --> 1017.90]  Sorry.
[1018.04 --> 1020.06]  We started scripting videos for the first time.
[1020.08 --> 1020.40]  Oh, I know.
[1020.60 --> 1021.50]  Super controversial.
[1022.14 --> 1023.98]  You know what sucks about that though?
[1024.28 --> 1027.38]  I used to be like so good at ad-libbing.
[1027.50 --> 1027.68]  You were.
[1027.68 --> 1029.06]  And I suck now.
[1029.44 --> 1031.54]  Like I have to do multiple takes of things.
[1031.76 --> 1032.92]  I used to have some of that.
[1032.92 --> 1034.36]  That's for, that's for losers.
[1034.54 --> 1036.80]  Because of hosting live at shows.
[1037.06 --> 1037.82]  And now I don't have it.
[1037.84 --> 1038.14]  Yeah.
[1038.56 --> 1039.00]  Not at all.
[1039.10 --> 1045.76]  Dude, it's, it is, it's a thing that you can practice and you can get really, really good at.
[1045.86 --> 1046.00]  Yeah.
[1046.04 --> 1049.24]  Like the whole getting a product briefing on something and being like, okay, shut up.
[1050.00 --> 1051.94]  Turning to the camera and nailing it.
[1052.16 --> 1052.18]  Like.
[1052.60 --> 1054.72]  And then doing like eight more of them in the same day.
[1054.76 --> 1054.86]  Yeah.
[1054.90 --> 1055.90]  You can practice it.
[1055.90 --> 1058.96]  But if you don't practice it, it doesn't matter how good you are.
[1059.02 --> 1060.30]  It doesn't matter how experienced you are.
[1060.32 --> 1061.58]  It is not like riding a bike.
[1061.74 --> 1061.94]  Yeah.
[1062.08 --> 1062.40]  Okay.
[1062.72 --> 1064.56]  Elijah could do it someday.
[1064.56 --> 1065.52]  Maybe I'll ride a bike.
[1065.52 --> 1069.34]  That was the, I was alluding to that you don't know how to ride a bike.
[1069.44 --> 1069.72]  Wear a helmet.
[1070.16 --> 1070.32]  Yeah.
[1070.38 --> 1074.30]  Well, that was actually up for debate being the third video on Elijah week.
[1074.38 --> 1075.74]  I had pitched backflip tutorial.
[1076.50 --> 1077.68]  Colton had denied that.
[1077.86 --> 1078.30]  Yeah.
[1078.64 --> 1078.96]  Which.
[1079.48 --> 1080.80]  Why did you even ask Colton?
[1081.06 --> 1081.44]  I didn't.
[1081.54 --> 1085.64]  I asked Sammy and I said we should beg for forgiveness instead of asking.
[1085.86 --> 1086.82]  Absolutely not.
[1087.26 --> 1089.78]  What if, what if they went to like a gymnastic center?
[1089.90 --> 1090.88]  I don't care.
[1091.64 --> 1093.72]  Look, he's talked about this publicly already.
[1093.72 --> 1097.72]  So I'm not disclosing personal medical information that he hasn't already put on the internet for some reason.
[1098.14 --> 1100.92]  Elijah has had half a dozen concussions.
[1101.24 --> 1101.94]  Which is bad.
[1102.08 --> 1105.20]  Literally the last one had to relearn his own birthday.
[1105.46 --> 1107.02]  I'm, dude, listen, I'm building.
[1107.34 --> 1110.76]  So when I say no fucking backflips.
[1110.76 --> 1114.38]  It is coming from an extremely serious place.
[1114.98 --> 1120.96]  And I am, I am saying that is not happening at work or for work or for clout on my watch.
[1121.06 --> 1122.70]  I'm building resistance though.
[1123.02 --> 1123.50]  That is.
[1123.68 --> 1124.66]  The more concussions you have.
[1124.80 --> 1125.94]  Not how it works.
[1126.16 --> 1126.56]  No, fake news.
[1126.58 --> 1127.44]  That's obviously fake news.
[1127.48 --> 1128.16]  Don't believe that.
[1128.32 --> 1128.46]  Please.
[1129.18 --> 1129.54]  Please.
[1129.74 --> 1131.12]  Very much the opposite, really.
[1131.12 --> 1135.74]  So when I'm talking about this and I'm like, no, Elijah's not allowed to do backflips.
[1135.80 --> 1136.60]  It's not a meme.
[1136.72 --> 1137.38]  I'm not memeing.
[1137.74 --> 1139.38]  I'm 100% serious.
[1139.88 --> 1140.28]  What?
[1140.56 --> 1140.92]  No.
[1141.54 --> 1144.06]  But yeah, I mean, why was Riley allowed to do one in his trailer?
[1147.70 --> 1148.52]  I don't think he.
[1148.52 --> 1148.82]  Elijah.
[1149.12 --> 1150.92]  To be fair, I didn't know Sammy recorded that.
[1151.08 --> 1152.72]  I didn't know that he was putting it in that video.
[1153.10 --> 1153.34]  My dad.
[1153.34 --> 1156.48]  My dad had a, he had a thing that he used to say to me.
[1156.64 --> 1156.88]  Okay.
[1156.98 --> 1160.14]  I'm probably revealing more about my childhood than I ever have before.
[1160.24 --> 1162.86]  But he used to say, you're cruising for a bruising.
[1164.38 --> 1165.12]  What does that mean?
[1165.42 --> 1166.16]  Can you show us?
[1166.20 --> 1167.24]  I'll let you figure it out.
[1168.74 --> 1170.38]  Dan, cover the camera.
[1171.98 --> 1172.74]  Oh God.
[1173.54 --> 1174.32]  So, uh.
[1174.52 --> 1174.88]  Anyways.
[1175.60 --> 1176.56]  No backflips.
[1176.96 --> 1177.54]  Oh no.
[1177.86 --> 1179.58]  Linus, please don't get blood on this set.
[1179.60 --> 1179.82]  Ow.
[1180.24 --> 1180.56]  Ow.
[1181.14 --> 1183.28]  Do you know how hard it is to get blood out of this carpet?
[1183.34 --> 1184.44]  I mean, look.
[1184.66 --> 1186.52]  Since we're being very honest right now.
[1186.52 --> 1187.04]  You probably wouldn't see it.
[1187.10 --> 1190.72]  Why don't we just reveal why we have a wrap sponsor for the show.
[1190.72 --> 1191.32]  Oh yeah.
[1192.22 --> 1192.44]  Oh.
[1193.60 --> 1195.10]  To cover the table.
[1195.56 --> 1195.82]  Oh.
[1197.08 --> 1198.94]  Just in case something gets on it.
[1198.96 --> 1200.68]  This would probably make it easier to clean too.
[1200.80 --> 1202.60]  I don't know about that, but I'm assuming.
[1203.62 --> 1207.46]  D Brand's skin's cleaned very easily with a soft cloth in there.
[1209.84 --> 1211.56]  Over a thousand men tested.
[1211.86 --> 1212.80]  Man hours tested.
[1213.20 --> 1218.22]  Fortunately, fortunately, no one's seeing this because everyone's watching the Jake Paul
[1218.22 --> 1221.34]  versus Mike Tyson fight because otherwise we are so cancelled right now.
[1221.34 --> 1221.60]  Well, no.
[1221.64 --> 1222.44]  They'll watch the VOD.
[1222.64 --> 1223.86]  So we're screwed either way.
[1224.92 --> 1225.78]  We can delete the VOD.
[1225.86 --> 1226.18]  We're good.
[1226.56 --> 1227.10]  That's true.
[1227.16 --> 1227.90]  We can do that.
[1228.02 --> 1228.66]  No, it goes on.
[1228.66 --> 1232.64]  I was actually asked to come on here not only to promote Elijah Week, but apparently talk
[1232.64 --> 1233.46]  about one of the topics.
[1233.68 --> 1233.96]  Oh.
[1234.20 --> 1234.50]  What topic?
[1234.50 --> 1235.26]  Did you want to talk about it?
[1235.26 --> 1237.20]  Why'd you pick that one?
[1237.20 --> 1239.74]  I have a screenshot from James that says...
[1239.74 --> 1241.66]  Am I allowed to say the P word?
[1243.16 --> 1243.78]  Like corn?
[1244.62 --> 1244.94]  Oh.
[1245.16 --> 1246.00]  Am I allowed to say that?
[1246.00 --> 1246.50]  Um.
[1246.68 --> 1247.72]  Of course you picked that one.
[1247.78 --> 1248.34]  Okay, I'll say corn.
[1248.34 --> 1249.76]  Yeah, because of course he did.
[1249.78 --> 1250.42]  No, I didn't.
[1250.58 --> 1251.84]  Guy's a f***ing degenerate.
[1252.68 --> 1253.84]  No, no, listen, listen, listen.
[1254.14 --> 1254.30]  Listen.
[1254.42 --> 1255.26]  It's literally...
[1255.26 --> 1258.70]  He's owned it to the point now where we can't even criticize him for it anymore.
[1258.78 --> 1261.92]  I already forgot about that whole topic, so I was really trying to be like, what one
[1261.92 --> 1262.62]  would he have picked?
[1262.74 --> 1263.64]  No, I sent...
[1263.64 --> 1267.70]  I sent James a couple, and I was like, here's the ones that I'm fine and comfortable talking
[1267.70 --> 1269.44]  about on stream, and he said...
[1269.44 --> 1270.92]  How about we go with seafood?
[1271.16 --> 1272.62]  He said, pick the corn one.
[1272.80 --> 1274.62]  That's on brand for Elijah.
[1274.84 --> 1275.90]  You can say prawn.
[1276.46 --> 1276.74]  Prawn?
[1276.98 --> 1277.38]  Okay.
[1277.78 --> 1278.82]  We'll go with seafood.
[1278.94 --> 1279.14]  Sure.
[1279.42 --> 1281.12]  So this is a very seafood-y topic.
[1282.24 --> 1286.70]  Why don't I do just the talking points, and then we'll open it up to discussion.
[1286.70 --> 1287.94]  I'm sure you'll have some thoughts.
[1288.06 --> 1288.66]  You're just like reacting?
[1289.08 --> 1290.58]  Oh, I know about it.
[1290.58 --> 1293.98]  The original article is from The Verge, also CNBC.
[1294.30 --> 1296.58]  Basically, this has been reported on.
[1297.02 --> 1303.78]  Wicked, originally a Broadway musical, by the way, excellent, so good, is getting a theatrical
[1303.78 --> 1305.98]  release on November 22nd.
[1306.46 --> 1312.56]  Toy company Mattel released a variety of dolls and other toys which, pun intended, were for
[1312.56 --> 1314.60]  purchase in stores and online retailers.
[1314.60 --> 1318.12]  On the packaging was a link to a website.
[1318.82 --> 1319.28]  www.
[1320.70 --> 1325.22]  Please don't go there right now, especially not at work or if you're in a family setting.
[1325.90 --> 1326.50]  Well, you know what?
[1326.52 --> 1327.16]  I'll just say this.
[1327.36 --> 1330.80]  www.thenameoftheshow.com
[1330.80 --> 1331.94]  I'm just going to not say it.
[1332.24 --> 1334.16]  Which led to...
[1334.16 --> 1335.14]  Not.
[1336.42 --> 1337.60]  Not the show.
[1337.86 --> 1339.48]  Well, it's a show of sorts.
[1339.66 --> 1340.20]  It's a different show.
[1340.34 --> 1341.22]  A seafood show.
[1341.70 --> 1343.10]  Don't link it in chat.
[1343.10 --> 1343.50]  Why?
[1343.80 --> 1344.92]  Stop it, you guys.
[1345.08 --> 1346.24]  I've got it on my third monitor.
[1347.16 --> 1347.52]  Stop!
[1347.80 --> 1350.32]  To be fair, I did fact check this at work, so sorry, Luke.
[1351.36 --> 1352.32]  Just wanted to...
[1352.32 --> 1354.22]  I was joking.
[1354.44 --> 1355.08]  Wait, did you actually?
[1355.28 --> 1356.28]  No, of course not.
[1356.30 --> 1356.96]  I'm not a psycho.
[1357.88 --> 1359.12]  So, the link was...
[1359.12 --> 1359.76]  I'm going to check.
[1359.94 --> 1361.10]  The link was...
[1361.10 --> 1364.44]  I will not.
[1364.68 --> 1366.10]  The intended link...
[1366.10 --> 1367.80]  Shut up, shut up, shut up.
[1367.80 --> 1371.72]  The intended link was wickedmovie.com.
[1371.88 --> 1374.20]  So, that one, we can check.
[1374.76 --> 1375.02]  Okay?
[1375.22 --> 1375.72]  We're going to go...
[1375.72 --> 1376.82]  Don't share the screen, just in case.
[1376.86 --> 1380.52]  We're going to go to wickedmovie.com, and hopefully nothing bad will happen.
[1380.72 --> 1381.26]  Okay, we're good.
[1381.34 --> 1381.84]  All right.
[1382.04 --> 1382.40]  Okay.
[1382.64 --> 1384.96]  Wickedmovie.com, November 22nd.
[1385.02 --> 1386.00]  Everything is okay.
[1386.20 --> 1388.20]  And we're still live on Twitch.
[1390.40 --> 1394.80]  Mattel has since apologized for this and removed the toys from online storefronts.
[1394.80 --> 1401.40]  Quote, parents are advised that the misprinted, incorrect website is not appropriate for children or Elijah.
[1402.74 --> 1404.32]  Sorry, I added the last bit.
[1405.38 --> 1411.00]  However, the removal of the toys didn't stop scalpers from trying to buy what remained on physical shelves,
[1411.80 --> 1416.50]  flipping the original misprint for as much as $2,100.
[1417.90 --> 1420.10]  To be fair, I don't know if any sold yet.
[1420.18 --> 1420.94]  Let's open up.
[1421.02 --> 1423.22]  Let's open up for discussion here.
[1423.22 --> 1429.02]  Our first discussion question is, do you think this type of thing happens often in media,
[1429.14 --> 1431.06]  and we just don't hear about it necessarily?
[1431.36 --> 1440.64]  E.g. phone numbers, addresses, or other placeholder info, or supposedly fake info.
[1440.72 --> 1442.00]  Do you think this happens all the time?
[1443.08 --> 1444.62]  I actually put a note in there.
[1444.88 --> 1449.62]  This happened in one of our videos, where we had put a placeholder or something.
[1449.76 --> 1452.00]  Is this the encyclopedia knowledge thing, or were you a part of it?
[1452.00 --> 1454.46]  I was a part of it, and it became a big thing after.
[1454.54 --> 1455.02]  What was this?
[1455.22 --> 1459.94]  I'm not going to say the exact video, because I don't want people to try to archive, like go back and find it or whatever.
[1459.94 --> 1460.56]  Oh, okay.
[1460.56 --> 1465.00]  But there was an address in a video that we had put that was supposed to be fake.
[1465.56 --> 1468.86]  Like a 1234 fake street, except fake street is an actual thing.
[1468.86 --> 1470.46]  It ended up being a real place.
[1470.58 --> 1474.40]  And we didn't realize it until a day later, because someone had left a comment.
[1474.58 --> 1476.20]  It was one comment on the video.
[1476.40 --> 1478.62]  Like, no one else had decided to go check this.
[1478.74 --> 1483.66]  And we did check it, but we must have either misspelled it or got it wrong or something.
[1483.66 --> 1487.04]  But then all of a sudden, I get a message that said, is this an issue?
[1487.46 --> 1488.86]  And I was like, probably.
[1491.30 --> 1492.82]  It was some random address.
[1493.06 --> 1497.26]  You got to just use 1600 Pennsylvania, the White House address.
[1497.44 --> 1497.56]  Yeah.
[1497.56 --> 1502.80]  My official address on Netflix is still the White House.
[1502.94 --> 1503.26]  Really?
[1503.48 --> 1509.50]  I wouldn't be surprised if they mail like pamphlet things addressed to me at the White House every once in a while.
[1510.68 --> 1513.24]  And the thing is, I haven't only done that on Netflix.
[1513.38 --> 1515.94]  There's some sites that will automatically block it if they see that.
[1516.34 --> 1517.68]  But that's been on a bunch of sites.
[1517.86 --> 1520.06]  So they almost certainly have mail.
[1520.06 --> 1525.88]  Speaking of the White House, that's another famous example of the importance of top level domains.
[1525.88 --> 1527.08]  Oh, yeah.
[1527.14 --> 1528.18]  Do you not know about this one?
[1529.64 --> 1531.34]  It's whitehouse.gov.
[1531.72 --> 1531.94]  Yeah.
[1532.10 --> 1534.36]  That's the right one.
[1534.54 --> 1534.74]  Yeah.
[1535.54 --> 1535.98]  Don't.
[1538.38 --> 1540.32]  Don't go to any other TLD.
[1540.34 --> 1541.20]  Someone linked it.
[1541.24 --> 1541.84]  Is it bad?
[1542.24 --> 1542.58]  Oh, yeah.
[1542.58 --> 1543.38]  Yeah, please remove it.
[1543.38 --> 1544.72]  Well, it was at some point.
[1544.72 --> 1545.50]  They said it used to be.
[1545.54 --> 1546.38]  Yeah, it used to be.
[1546.48 --> 1547.32]  It used to be a...
[1547.32 --> 1548.16]  You're getting close!
[1548.16 --> 1549.98]  It used to be a seafood website.
[1550.92 --> 1552.48]  Oh, there's a lot of them out there.
[1552.72 --> 1553.98]  Well, seafood's very popular.
[1553.98 --> 1555.98]  Oh!
[1555.98 --> 1556.98]  Most of the internet is seafood.
[1556.98 --> 1558.98]  I hear the fourth most visited website is a seafood website.
[1558.98 --> 1559.98]  Is it?
[1559.98 --> 1561.98]  It's in the top ten.
[1561.98 --> 1562.98]  I know it peaked at four at one point.
[1562.98 --> 1563.98]  That's a little surprising.
[1563.98 --> 1564.98]  Probably during COVID.
[1564.98 --> 1566.98]  TGA Fridays, unlimited shrimp.
[1566.98 --> 1568.98]  And I know in the top 20, there's like three or four.
[1568.98 --> 1570.98]  That would be a really interesting dive, actually.
[1570.98 --> 1572.98]  What happened to the internet during COVID?
[1572.98 --> 1576.98]  Like, how did people change how they used the internet when they were all stuck at home?
[1576.98 --> 1577.98]  There is an amazing...
[1577.98 --> 1578.98]  We could have a whole series.
[1578.98 --> 1579.98]  We could call it Divers.
[1579.98 --> 1582.98]  And look into the things that happened on the internet.
[1582.98 --> 1583.98]  Look into seafood.
[1583.98 --> 1584.98]  Seafood Divers.
[1584.98 --> 1585.98]  Seafood Divers.
[1585.98 --> 1586.98]  Seafood trends.
[1586.98 --> 1590.98]  There's an amazing graph for Twitch when COVID happened during Twitch.
[1590.98 --> 1591.98]  Yeah.
[1591.98 --> 1593.98]  It's like, oh yeah, we're slowly growing.
[1593.98 --> 1594.98]  And then April, like, just like...
[1594.98 --> 1595.98]  Explosive.
[1595.98 --> 1596.98]  It doubled.
[1596.98 --> 1597.98]  It was insane.
[1597.98 --> 1598.98]  Yeah.
[1598.98 --> 1599.98]  But, yeah.
[1599.98 --> 1601.98]  Do you think this happens in any other media, though?
[1601.98 --> 1602.98]  No.
[1602.98 --> 1603.98]  Absolutely.
[1603.98 --> 1604.98]  Like...
[1604.98 --> 1607.98]  I've heard of this type of thing happening before.
[1607.98 --> 1609.98]  But I don't have examples off the top of my head.
[1609.98 --> 1617.98]  I don't know if this one is true, but apparently there was a tip line that the US military published,
[1617.98 --> 1622.98]  and it was accidentally like a pay-per-minute phone line.
[1622.98 --> 1623.98]  Oh.
[1623.98 --> 1624.98]  Yes.
[1624.98 --> 1631.98]  I've validated that, but it wouldn't really surprise me that much, because a lot of those
[1631.98 --> 1635.98]  high-priced, like, 1-800, like, paid numbers were that.
[1635.98 --> 1641.98]  So if you were to accidentally typo it, it would be pretty easy for it to be one of those.
[1641.98 --> 1642.98]  Mm-hmm.
[1642.98 --> 1643.98]  Okay.
[1643.98 --> 1645.98]  And then going into question two, though, what do you think...
[1645.98 --> 1648.98]  How long do people have to hold on to these domains or phone numbers?
[1648.98 --> 1649.98]  Yeah.
[1649.98 --> 1655.98]  That's my discussion question that I put in, because in some cases it can be a situation
[1655.98 --> 1658.98]  where you publish printed materials.
[1658.98 --> 1664.98]  So whether it's on a package for a product, or whether it's on a pamphlet, or whether it's
[1664.98 --> 1665.98]  on...
[1665.98 --> 1666.98]  Who knows?
[1666.98 --> 1667.98]  A sticker.
[1667.98 --> 1668.98]  Like, it doesn't matter.
[1668.98 --> 1673.98]  I come across all the time, whenever we look at anything retro, like games, for example...
[1673.98 --> 1674.98]  The Nintendo helpline is on, like, everything.
[1674.98 --> 1677.98]  Yeah, they'll have help support lines, they'll have websites.
[1677.98 --> 1684.98]  How long is, like, the statute of limitations for having to keep paying for that domain?
[1684.98 --> 1690.98]  I mean, not every website can be freaking spacejam.com, okay?
[1690.98 --> 1691.98]  Spacejam...
[1691.98 --> 1692.98]  Uh-oh.
[1692.98 --> 1693.98]  Uh-oh.
[1693.98 --> 1694.98]  What's gonna load?
[1694.98 --> 1695.98]  Is this the White House?
[1695.98 --> 1696.98]  No way.
[1696.98 --> 1698.98]  You told me to not go to it, and you went to it?
[1698.98 --> 1699.98]  Oh, yeah.
[1699.98 --> 1700.98]  I said not to...
[1700.98 --> 1702.98]  I went to .org.
[1702.98 --> 1703.98]  Or .gov, you mean?
[1703.98 --> 1704.98]  Spacejam is...
[1704.98 --> 1706.98]  Spacejam.com is down?
[1706.98 --> 1707.98]  Can we buy it?
[1707.98 --> 1708.98]  Oh!
[1709.98 --> 1710.98]  No way!
[1711.98 --> 1716.98]  It, like, tried to redirect me to Spacejam New Legacy, like the new one.
[1716.98 --> 1717.98]  Oh, womp womp.
[1717.98 --> 1720.98]  I didn't know that Spacejam.com was down!
[1720.98 --> 1723.98]  You gotta go to Spacejam.com slash 1996.
[1723.98 --> 1725.98]  Oh, that sucks!
[1725.98 --> 1726.98]  It does kinda suck.
[1727.98 --> 1728.98]  Cause they...
[1728.98 --> 1729.98]  Did they do a new movie or something?
[1729.98 --> 1730.98]  Yeah, they did.
[1730.98 --> 1732.98]  Yeah, yeah, apparently it was, like, not very good.
[1732.98 --> 1734.98]  But, like, realistically, was the original one really good?
[1734.98 --> 1735.98]  Yes.
[1735.98 --> 1736.98]  I don't know.
[1736.98 --> 1737.98]  I didn't rewatch it.
[1737.98 --> 1738.98]  Wrong.
[1738.98 --> 1739.98]  In my nostalgia glasses, it's good.
[1739.98 --> 1740.98]  Don't worry, Luke, I'm with you.
[1740.98 --> 1743.98]  But I'm not gonna rewatch it just in case it's actually garbage.
[1743.98 --> 1744.98]  Honestly, I don't even know.
[1744.98 --> 1746.98]  I don't think I've seen the whole first one.
[1746.98 --> 1749.98]  It's great, but it hasn't held up in my opinion.
[1749.98 --> 1750.98]  Yeah, alright.
[1750.98 --> 1757.98]  Um, so yeah, so how long should they be responsible for continuing to pay the renewal fees for a domain?
[1757.98 --> 1762.98]  Would you have to just, like, pay up front for that whole time or something to, like, prove that you're actually gonna do it?
[1762.98 --> 1764.98]  Cause you can buy 100-year domains, right?
[1764.98 --> 1766.98]  Like, I understand it's expensive.
[1766.98 --> 1772.98]  And especially if you're getting, like, I don't know, x.com, because that's gonna cost a million dollars or whatever.
[1772.98 --> 1781.98]  But at that point, if you're launching some big product and getting a new domain name for it, you should buy 100 years.
[1781.98 --> 1783.98]  Sure, but why should you have to do that?
[1783.98 --> 1784.98]  We don't.
[1784.98 --> 1785.98]  I don't even, yeah, we don't.
[1785.98 --> 1789.98]  We have, we've had domains, like, I think, do we still have, um, hold on.
[1789.98 --> 1790.98]  Um, hold on.
[1793.98 --> 1795.98]  Oh, yeah, we apparently still have this.
[1795.98 --> 1796.98]  Um.
[1796.98 --> 1800.98]  When I was doing an eval, I had so many questions about that domain.
[1800.98 --> 1806.98]  This is f***ingyourwallet.com, which we included in one of our videos, uh, ages ago.
[1806.98 --> 1807.98]  So many questions.
[1807.98 --> 1808.98]  Oh, whoops, hold on.
[1808.98 --> 1809.98]  Did I?
[1809.98 --> 1810.98]  What just happened?
[1810.98 --> 1811.98]  Okay.
[1811.98 --> 1812.98]  Uh, yeah, there we go.
[1812.98 --> 1813.98]  Okay, it's working now.
[1813.98 --> 1822.98]  So, this was included in one of our videos, like, a bazillion years ago, and is just a simple little game, uh, where you dodge the expensive products.
[1822.98 --> 1824.98]  Uh, there's Razer laptops.
[1824.98 --> 1827.98]  Hey, why does your, why does the money spent go up even if you don't touch the product?
[1827.98 --> 1830.98]  Uh, I don't know, you're just spending money because, like.
[1830.98 --> 1831.98]  We live in a society.
[1831.98 --> 1832.98]  Yeah, f*** your wallet, right?
[1832.98 --> 1834.98]  Oh, okay, so it's like rent and taxes and stuff.
[1834.98 --> 1840.98]  Yeah, so it's Razer laptops, iPhones, and red cameras that just come flying out of nowhere, and you have to try to dodge them.
[1840.98 --> 1841.98]  It's just genuinely really hard.
[1841.98 --> 1842.98]  Uh, oh, it's, it's super hard.
[1842.98 --> 1843.98]  It's easier on a bigger screen.
[1843.98 --> 1845.98]  Yeah, I was gonna say, you're also on a trackpad.
[1845.98 --> 1846.98]  And I'm on a trackpad, so.
[1846.98 --> 1847.98]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[1847.98 --> 1848.98]  But some of them, some of them come in real fast.
[1848.98 --> 1853.98]  Yeah, no, they, they, they, they, they, those red cameras come in hot, brother.
[1853.98 --> 1856.98]  They, they come in real hot.
[1856.98 --> 1860.98]  And I think the red cameras target you, so you have to be constantly moving if you want to dodge.
[1860.98 --> 1861.98]  Oh!
[1861.98 --> 1862.98]  Oh!
[1862.98 --> 1863.98]  No!
[1863.98 --> 1864.98]  No!
[1864.98 --> 1865.98]  Oh, God.
[1865.98 --> 1869.98]  Um, so, like, this is a, this is a question that I legitimately have.
[1869.98 --> 1875.98]  How long do I have to keep paying for this stupid domain because we made a video with this joke in it?
[1875.98 --> 1877.98]  Like, these are iPhone 7s or something.
[1877.98 --> 1878.98]  We should, we should.
[1878.98 --> 1880.98]  Like, this is from like, seven years ago.
[1880.98 --> 1885.98]  We should make a mirror of ltdstore.com where everything's just like ten times the price, and then just redirect that to it.
[1885.98 --> 1886.98]  See if anyone buys anything.
[1886.98 --> 1888.98]  Can we, can we promote Luke?
[1888.98 --> 1890.98]  Can we keep affording the domain going forward?
[1890.98 --> 1894.98]  Because if someone, that would help cover our, our like, old domains.
[1894.98 --> 1900.98]  And like, there's, there's lots of domains that we've bought over the years, because we've like, I don't know, thought, like, did we buy makeupforbros.com?
[1900.98 --> 1901.98]  I think so.
[1901.98 --> 1902.98]  I think so.
[1902.98 --> 1906.98]  I think we might have bought that at some point, because I thought it'd be like a cool channel idea, like, 12 years ago.
[1906.98 --> 1911.98]  Like, like, men's makeup tips and stuff, because men's makeup was totally becoming a thing.
[1911.98 --> 1912.98]  Yeah.
[1912.98 --> 1916.98]  We bought, uh, uh, adequate, um.
[1916.98 --> 1917.98]  Adequate video service?
[1917.98 --> 1919.98]  Yeah, we bought adquatevideoservice.com.
[1919.98 --> 1926.98]  I remember some videos where you jokingly said a URL, and then at the end of the video, I hear you go, please go buy that right now.
[1926.98 --> 1929.98]  And then I went to it, and it just redirects to ltdstore.
[1929.98 --> 1932.98]  So like, every time you crack a joke, and I think part of it also though.
[1932.98 --> 1933.98]  We've let some of those go over the years.
[1933.98 --> 1934.98]  Sure.
[1934.98 --> 1941.98]  But I think part of it also though, is like, if you do say that or claim it, and then people who trust you are trying to go to them, in the case Wicked.
[1941.98 --> 1942.98]  You don't want it to.
[1942.98 --> 1943.98]  Be malicious.
[1943.98 --> 1944.98]  You don't want it to go to something else.
[1944.98 --> 1948.98]  You also don't want someone to be able to get it, and then set up a site that looks like yours.
[1948.98 --> 1953.98]  Yeah, that's one of the reasons that we've stopped memeing on like, coming up with domain names on the show.
[1953.98 --> 1954.98]  We used to all the time.
[1954.98 --> 1960.98]  Because people would buy them, and it became like a thing, and they would redirect them to ltdstore, or to the forum, or whatever.
[1960.98 --> 1962.98]  Hoping that we would say that it did that.
[1962.98 --> 1963.98]  Yep.
[1963.98 --> 1967.98]  And then, conceivably, I don't think anyone ever did this.
[1967.98 --> 1972.98]  Not that I'm aware of, but conceivably, after we talk about it, they could...
[1972.98 --> 1973.98]  I know of a singular bad example.
[1973.98 --> 1974.98]  A singular bad example.
[1974.98 --> 1975.98]  You do?
[1975.98 --> 1976.98]  Okay.
[1976.98 --> 1977.98]  Yeah.
[1977.98 --> 1980.98]  So, they could take that domain, and they could use it to harvest data, they could redirect
[1980.98 --> 1985.98]  it to somewhere malicious, and we would be...
[1985.98 --> 1990.98]  We would feel bad about it, whether we're responsible for that or not.
[1990.98 --> 1993.98]  I don't know, I'm not a lawyer, and you're not a cop.
[1993.98 --> 1995.98]  So, who knows?
[1995.98 --> 1999.98]  But, I'd feel hurt in my feelingsies.
[1999.98 --> 2001.98]  So, we don't do that anymore.
[2001.98 --> 2002.98]  That's fair.
[2003.98 --> 2004.98]  All right.
[2004.98 --> 2005.98]  Well...
[2005.98 --> 2006.98]  Someone just said...
[2007.98 --> 2008.98]  Where is it?
[2008.98 --> 2009.98]  One sec.
[2009.98 --> 2012.98]  Someone just said, adequatevideoservice.com should redirect to Flowplane.
[2012.98 --> 2013.98]  It does.
[2013.98 --> 2016.98]  That one we own, so it's fine.
[2016.98 --> 2020.98]  And I don't think we're gonna get rid of that one, because I keep telling Luke that I want...
[2020.98 --> 2021.98]  No, probably not.
[2021.98 --> 2026.98]  I've wanted it for years to be something that if people dug deep enough into Flowplane's
[2026.98 --> 2028.98]  sort of workings, they could find it.
[2028.98 --> 2030.98]  Does it actually run any services right now?
[2030.98 --> 2031.98]  I don't remember.
[2031.98 --> 2034.98]  I think at one point we thought about it, I don't remember if we actually did it or not.
[2034.98 --> 2035.98]  Okay, I still want it to.
[2035.98 --> 2036.98]  Yeah.
[2036.98 --> 2037.98]  That's Flowplane.
[2037.98 --> 2038.98]  Adequate video service.
[2040.98 --> 2042.98]  It's a little joke, but it checks out.
[2042.98 --> 2043.98]  Well, cool.
[2043.98 --> 2044.98]  Okay.
[2044.98 --> 2045.98]  Is this you wanting to leave?
[2045.98 --> 2046.98]  I don't know if I'm supposed to...
[2046.98 --> 2049.98]  I feel like I'm like Elijah's dad, he's trying to get off the phone.
[2049.98 --> 2050.98]  Well, I don't wanna...
[2050.98 --> 2051.98]  I don't wanna overstay my welcome.
[2051.98 --> 2053.98]  I'll stay here all day if you guys need me to.
[2053.98 --> 2055.98]  I just don't wanna overstay my welcome.
[2055.98 --> 2056.98]  Sounds good.
[2056.98 --> 2057.98]  Okay.
[2057.98 --> 2058.98]  Okay.
[2058.98 --> 2061.98]  I had to change because of him.
[2061.98 --> 2063.98]  We were in the exact same clothes.
[2063.98 --> 2064.98]  Oh.
[2064.98 --> 2065.98]  Oh wow, really?
[2065.98 --> 2066.98]  You had a red sweater?
[2066.98 --> 2068.98]  And we both had the cargo pants.
[2068.98 --> 2069.98]  Oh wow!
[2069.98 --> 2071.98]  What sweater are you wearing?
[2071.98 --> 2072.98]  The...
[2072.98 --> 2073.98]  Oh!
[2073.98 --> 2075.98]  I actually don't know the name.
[2075.98 --> 2076.98]  Really?
[2076.98 --> 2077.98]  I just got it given to me.
[2077.98 --> 2078.98]  Okay.
[2078.98 --> 2079.98]  Tell you what, Elijah.
[2079.98 --> 2080.98]  It's like a...
[2080.98 --> 2081.98]  What's on the front of it?
[2081.98 --> 2082.98]  A plant.
[2084.98 --> 2085.98]  A tree.
[2085.98 --> 2086.98]  Okay, and what's it made of?
[2086.98 --> 2087.98]  Wires.
[2087.98 --> 2088.98]  Wires.
[2088.98 --> 2089.98]  Okay, try again, try again.
[2089.98 --> 2090.98]  Cables.
[2090.98 --> 2091.98]  Oh!
[2091.98 --> 2092.98]  Try again.
[2092.98 --> 2093.98]  Both technically correct.
[2093.98 --> 2094.98]  Thanks, Dan.
[2094.98 --> 2096.98]  It starts with a C.
[2097.98 --> 2098.98]  Well, cables.
[2098.98 --> 2100.98]  It starts with a C-I.
[2100.98 --> 2101.98]  It starts with a K.
[2101.98 --> 2102.98]  It does not.
[2102.98 --> 2103.98]  Circuit.
[2103.98 --> 2104.98]  There you go.
[2104.98 --> 2105.98]  There you go.
[2105.98 --> 2106.98]  Is cables not like a tree?
[2106.98 --> 2107.98]  So, it's a what?
[2107.98 --> 2108.98]  Yeah.
[2108.98 --> 2110.98]  It's a tree that's made of circuits.
[2110.98 --> 2112.98]  Okay, try it in the other order.
[2112.98 --> 2114.98]  It's a circuit that's made to look like a tree.
[2114.98 --> 2115.98]  Okay.
[2115.98 --> 2116.98]  Now, shorten it.
[2116.98 --> 2118.98]  It's a circuit that looks like a tree.
[2118.98 --> 2119.98]  Reduce more.
[2119.98 --> 2120.98]  Oh!
[2120.98 --> 2121.98]  Oh!
[2121.98 --> 2122.98]  Oh!
[2122.98 --> 2123.98]  Circuitry!
[2124.98 --> 2126.98]  That's so good.
[2126.98 --> 2127.98]  It's good.
[2127.98 --> 2130.98]  Oh yeah, we were accidental twins today.
[2130.98 --> 2134.98]  We even are both wearing black shoes with white soles.
[2134.98 --> 2135.98]  Oh yeah.
[2135.98 --> 2136.98]  I can't get my leg that high.
[2136.98 --> 2138.98]  Yeah, which is why I don't let them do backflips.
[2138.98 --> 2139.98]  Oh my god.
[2139.98 --> 2140.98]  I can do a backflip.
[2141.98 --> 2142.98]  I believe you.
[2143.98 --> 2144.98]  So then let's show the people.
[2144.98 --> 2145.98]  I wish for you to show me.
[2145.98 --> 2146.98]  No, I don't want you to show me.
[2146.98 --> 2147.98]  Okay, you can go.
[2147.98 --> 2148.98]  That's on the under table camera.
[2148.98 --> 2149.98]  Bye everyone.
[2149.98 --> 2150.98]  Thanks for having me over here.
[2150.98 --> 2151.98]  Okay, bye.
[2151.98 --> 2152.98]  Bye.
[2152.98 --> 2153.98]  Where do I put this?
[2153.98 --> 2154.98]  Just on the ground.
[2154.98 --> 2155.98]  Floor!
[2155.98 --> 2156.98]  Eh.
[2156.98 --> 2157.98]  Matt Man says, OMG Elijah.
[2157.98 --> 2159.98]  I wanted to believe he was being deliberately obtuse.
[2160.98 --> 2161.98]  I don't know.
[2161.98 --> 2163.98]  Sometimes the brain just doesn't do stuff.
[2163.98 --> 2164.98]  Muted?
[2164.98 --> 2165.98]  Who's muted?
[2165.98 --> 2166.98]  Which one of you were muted?
[2166.98 --> 2167.98]  He's not a muse.
[2167.98 --> 2168.98]  He's a cute.
[2168.98 --> 2169.98]  Aww.
[2169.98 --> 2170.98]  Okay, get out of here.
[2170.98 --> 2171.98]  I'm reporting that scenario.
[2171.98 --> 2172.98]  Go watch your fight!
[2172.98 --> 2173.98]  I'm reporting that scenario.
[2173.98 --> 2174.98]  Oh no.
[2176.98 --> 2177.98]  Small angle.
[2177.98 --> 2178.98]  Alright.
[2178.98 --> 2182.98]  Wanna 1v1 me, um, f***ingyourwallet.com?
[2182.98 --> 2183.98]  Oh, wow.
[2183.98 --> 2185.98]  Dan, do you want to set a timer?
[2185.98 --> 2186.98]  Uh, yeah, sure.
[2186.98 --> 2187.98]  I wonder if I still-
[2187.98 --> 2189.98]  I feel like this is going to be really hard on trackpad.
[2189.98 --> 2193.98]  I wonder if I still have that timer for the Wheel of Pain.
[2193.98 --> 2194.98]  Okay, no, hold on.
[2194.98 --> 2195.98]  We'll have to start at the same time.
[2195.98 --> 2196.98]  But yeah, you can warm up.
[2196.98 --> 2197.98]  Get warmed up.
[2197.98 --> 2198.98]  Can I do this as an overlay?
[2198.98 --> 2199.98]  Okay, we're doing this thing.
[2199.98 --> 2200.98]  Oh no!
[2200.98 --> 2202.98]  It starts to go off the rails so fast!
[2202.98 --> 2203.98]  Oh!
[2203.98 --> 2204.98]  Okay, 1 minute timer.
[2204.98 --> 2205.98]  Oh, dude, he's got it.
[2205.98 --> 2206.98]  Look at it.
[2206.98 --> 2207.98]  Look at it go.
[2207.98 --> 2208.98]  Is that a 1 minute timer?
[2208.98 --> 2209.98]  I don't know, it looks like something.
[2209.98 --> 2210.98]  Okay.
[2210.98 --> 2211.98]  You could just time it on your phone.
[2211.98 --> 2212.98]  Are you ready?
[2212.98 --> 2214.98]  Okay, so we'll press F5 to start.
[2214.98 --> 2215.98]  Yeah.
[2215.98 --> 2216.98]  And then, can you show our screens?
[2216.98 --> 2217.98]  Uh...
[2217.98 --> 2218.98]  Do you have that power?
[2218.98 --> 2219.98]  Of course.
[2219.98 --> 2220.98]  Tough.
[2220.98 --> 2221.98]  I need a sec to figure it out.
[2221.98 --> 2222.98]  What camera are you on right now?
[2222.98 --> 2223.98]  You could also just switch between us.
[2223.98 --> 2227.98]  And then we go layers, and then we go...
[2227.98 --> 2230.98]  Dude, if you just stand in one spot, you spend a lot of money.
[2230.98 --> 2231.98]  Uh, yeah.
[2231.98 --> 2232.98]  The reds, man.
[2232.98 --> 2233.98]  The reds.
[2233.98 --> 2234.98]  The reds are pretty...
[2234.98 --> 2235.98]  They're pretty brutal.
[2235.98 --> 2236.98]  They...
[2236.98 --> 2237.98]  They're gonna getcha.
[2237.98 --> 2238.98]  They're gonna getcha.
[2240.98 --> 2243.98]  Those reds, they add up real fast.
[2243.98 --> 2244.98]  Okay.
[2245.98 --> 2246.98]  Nice.
[2246.98 --> 2247.98]  That looks good enough to me.
[2247.98 --> 2248.98]  It's so hard on the trackpad.
[2248.98 --> 2249.98]  Ugh.
[2249.98 --> 2250.98]  Look at this guy!
[2250.98 --> 2254.98]  He's such a sweaty gamer, that he has to wipe his hands off before he plays.
[2254.98 --> 2255.98]  Yeah.
[2255.98 --> 2256.98]  This is...
[2256.98 --> 2258.98]  Literal sweaty gamer.
[2258.98 --> 2259.98]  Yeah.
[2259.98 --> 2260.98]  Alright, let's do this thing.
[2260.98 --> 2264.98]  I hadn't thought about this site in so long.
[2264.98 --> 2266.98]  What's hosting it?
[2266.98 --> 2267.98]  I don't know.
[2267.98 --> 2269.98]  I mean, you tell me.
[2269.98 --> 2273.98]  I think this is like, way pre the infra team.
[2273.98 --> 2274.98]  Uh, yeah.
[2274.98 --> 2276.98]  This is probably on like, some Jake thing.
[2276.98 --> 2277.98]  You think so?
[2277.98 --> 2278.98]  Probably.
[2278.98 --> 2281.98]  Oh, that actually kind of makes sense.
[2281.98 --> 2282.98]  That's hilarious.
[2282.98 --> 2283.98]  Well, who even made this game?
[2283.98 --> 2284.98]  I have no idea.
[2284.98 --> 2285.98]  I don't remember anymore.
[2285.98 --> 2287.98]  I don't think it was my group.
[2287.98 --> 2288.98]  Are you sure?
[2289.98 --> 2293.98]  I immediately started questioning that in my head when it came up on screen, but I don't...
[2293.98 --> 2294.98]  I actually...
[2294.98 --> 2295.98]  I actually don't remember.
[2295.98 --> 2297.98]  This was so long ago.
[2297.98 --> 2298.98]  Some Jake thing.
[2298.98 --> 2299.98]  Ouch.
[2299.98 --> 2300.98]  That's not an ouch.
[2300.98 --> 2301.98]  Yeah.
[2301.98 --> 2302.98]  He just has a lot of different things.
[2302.98 --> 2303.98]  I can't really like define it.
[2303.98 --> 2304.98]  Yeah, who can keep track of it?
[2304.98 --> 2305.98]  Uh, okay.
[2305.98 --> 2307.98]  Dan, that's good enough.
[2307.98 --> 2308.98]  Just set a timer on your phone.
[2308.98 --> 2309.98]  It's fine.
[2309.98 --> 2311.98]  No, you just have to call it and then it counts down.
[2311.98 --> 2312.98]  Oh, brilliant.
[2312.98 --> 2313.98]  It's a countdown.
[2313.98 --> 2314.98]  Okay.
[2314.98 --> 2315.98]  That's what you wanted, right?
[2315.98 --> 2316.98]  Yeah.
[2316.98 --> 2317.98]  Brilliant.
[2317.98 --> 2318.98]  Okay, ready?
[2318.98 --> 2319.98]  Yeah.
[2319.98 --> 2320.98]  Here we go.
[2320.98 --> 2321.98]  Here we go.
[2321.98 --> 2322.98]  Here.
[2322.98 --> 2323.98]  Oh God.
[2323.98 --> 2324.98]  Oh God.
[2324.98 --> 2325.98]  I got hit by...
[2325.98 --> 2326.98]  I got hit by two reds already, dude.
[2326.98 --> 2327.98]  I am like done.
[2327.98 --> 2328.98]  I don't think I...
[2328.98 --> 2330.98]  I will never financially recover from this.
[2334.98 --> 2335.98]  You can't...
[2335.98 --> 2336.98]  You can't hang out at the edges.
[2336.98 --> 2337.98]  You can't...
[2337.98 --> 2338.98]  Oh, I got hit by another red.
[2338.98 --> 2339.98]  I'm dodging.
[2339.98 --> 2340.98]  I'm dipping.
[2340.98 --> 2341.98]  I'm weaving.
[2341.98 --> 2342.98]  I'm trying.
[2342.98 --> 2343.98]  I'm making...
[2343.98 --> 2344.98]  Oh no!
[2344.98 --> 2345.98]  Oh my God!
[2345.98 --> 2351.98]  Look guys, this is way, way harder than...
[2351.98 --> 2352.98]  Oh shoot.
[2352.98 --> 2354.98]  It's way harder than it looks.
[2354.98 --> 2356.98]  I think I was doing better before I was competing.
[2356.98 --> 2357.98]  No.
[2357.98 --> 2358.98]  No.
[2358.98 --> 2359.98]  Okay, hold on.
[2359.98 --> 2360.98]  What's the timer?
[2360.98 --> 2361.98]  20 seconds.
[2361.98 --> 2362.98]  Oh crap!
[2362.98 --> 2363.98]  That's so long.
[2363.98 --> 2364.98]  No!
[2364.98 --> 2365.98]  Okay, okay.
[2365.98 --> 2366.98]  Shoot.
[2366.98 --> 2367.98]  Focus.
[2367.98 --> 2368.98]  Two more iPhones.
[2368.98 --> 2369.98]  10 seconds.
[2369.98 --> 2371.98]  Two more iPhones, another razor blade.
[2371.98 --> 2372.98]  Oh!
[2372.98 --> 2373.98]  Oh!
[2373.98 --> 2374.98]  Oh my goodness, I had three...
[2374.98 --> 2376.98]  Three red cameras come for me!
[2376.98 --> 2378.98]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[2378.98 --> 2380.98]  And the winner is look!
[2381.98 --> 2385.98]  $300,000 spent to Linus's $930,000.
[2385.98 --> 2389.98]  I got hit by so many red cameras.
[2390.98 --> 2392.98]  Alright, you can get rid of that.
[2392.98 --> 2394.98]  That's gonna take like half an hour, sorry.
[2394.98 --> 2395.98]  GG.
[2395.98 --> 2396.98]  Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[2396.98 --> 2398.98]  Okay, I'm gonna just...
[2398.98 --> 2399.98]  Boop, boop, boop.
[2399.98 --> 2400.98]  Yeah, cool, there we go.
[2400.98 --> 2401.98]  Now I can close that.
[2401.98 --> 2402.98]  Boop.
[2402.98 --> 2404.98]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[2404.98 --> 2405.98]  Let's talk about announcements.
[2405.98 --> 2406.98]  What even is this show?
[2406.98 --> 2407.98]  I can't even tell anymore.
[2407.98 --> 2408.98]  Oh no.
[2408.98 --> 2409.98]  It doesn't matter, does it?
[2409.98 --> 2410.98]  It was less than 50k for so long.
[2410.98 --> 2414.98]  Yeah, I was killing it for a while and then I started getting smacked.
[2414.98 --> 2416.98]  Those red cameras, dude, they come out of nowhere.
[2416.98 --> 2419.98]  Those are so brutal, they're so fast and they crank your score up so much.
[2419.98 --> 2420.98]  Anyways.
[2420.98 --> 2421.98]  GG.
[2421.98 --> 2422.98]  GG, brother.
[2422.98 --> 2423.98]  GG, indeed.
[2423.98 --> 2424.98]  GG, indeed.
[2424.98 --> 2426.98]  Yeah, we're doing announcements.
[2426.98 --> 2427.98]  Yeah, let's do it.
[2427.98 --> 2428.98]  What?
[2428.98 --> 2430.98]  Did you just call them merch messages?
[2430.98 --> 2431.98]  Merch messages?
[2431.98 --> 2432.98]  Oh, we're doing merch messages.
[2432.98 --> 2433.98]  We're doing merch messages.
[2433.98 --> 2434.98]  Oh, right, okay.
[2434.98 --> 2435.98]  Explain merch messages.
[2435.98 --> 2436.98]  Do we get...
[2436.98 --> 2437.98]  Here's a question before we do that.
[2437.98 --> 2439.98]  Do we get a new name for it?
[2439.98 --> 2440.98]  What?
[2440.98 --> 2442.98]  I'm not even part of that team.
[2442.98 --> 2443.98]  Oh.
[2443.98 --> 2445.98]  I'm kind of tired of it being called merch.
[2445.98 --> 2446.98]  That makes sense.
[2446.98 --> 2449.98]  What do you call bonus bin items?
[2449.98 --> 2451.98]  Uh, oh, yeah.
[2451.98 --> 2453.98]  What do you guys call the bonus bin items again?
[2453.98 --> 2454.98]  That's an internal name.
[2454.98 --> 2455.98]  We don't need to talk about that.
[2455.98 --> 2456.98]  No, it's something totally stupid.
[2456.98 --> 2458.98]  I want the merch messages named like that.
[2458.98 --> 2460.98]  The free item upsell or something.
[2460.98 --> 2461.98]  Free upsell.
[2461.98 --> 2462.98]  It's the fuss.
[2462.98 --> 2463.98]  The free upsell shelf.
[2463.98 --> 2464.98]  That's an internal name, okay?
[2464.98 --> 2467.98]  I want merch messages to sound like that.
[2467.98 --> 2468.98]  Um, oh man.
[2468.98 --> 2469.98]  Yeah, okay.
[2469.98 --> 2470.98]  So what are other competing products?
[2470.98 --> 2471.98]  Free upsell message?
[2471.98 --> 2472.98]  You've got super chats.
[2472.98 --> 2473.98]  That's what YouTube calls them.
[2473.98 --> 2474.98]  You've got Twitch bits or cheers or...
[2474.98 --> 2478.98]  They've got like a billion different ways you can throw them in the screen on Twitch.
[2478.98 --> 2479.98]  Additional live order comment.
[2479.98 --> 2480.98]  What is that?
[2480.98 --> 2481.98]  A-L-O-C?
[2481.98 --> 2482.98]  Yeah, that's really not rolling off the tongue, Dan.
[2482.98 --> 2483.98]  Yeah, that was the point.
[2483.98 --> 2484.98]  Money talks.
[2484.98 --> 2485.98]  Money talks.
[2485.98 --> 2486.98]  Money talks.
[2486.98 --> 2487.98]  Money talks.
[2487.98 --> 2488.98]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2488.98 --> 2489.98]  I don't know.
[2489.98 --> 2490.98]  I don't know.
[2490.98 --> 2491.98]  I don't know.
[2491.98 --> 2492.98]  I don't know.
[2492.98 --> 2493.98]  I don't know.
[2493.98 --> 2494.98]  I don't know.
[2494.98 --> 2495.98]  I don't know.
[2495.98 --> 2497.98]  Money talks.
[2497.98 --> 2498.98]  Money talks.
[2498.98 --> 2499.98]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[2499.98 --> 2501.98]  Um, super bits.
[2501.98 --> 2504.98]  Parasocial message.
[2504.98 --> 2505.98]  Super?
[2505.98 --> 2507.98]  Parasocial message is pretty funny.
[2507.98 --> 2508.98]  Super bits is pretty funny.
[2508.98 --> 2509.98]  Send me a PM.
[2509.98 --> 2512.98]  Like, which one of you is going to sue us?
[2512.98 --> 2513.98]  We took half of both of you.
[2513.98 --> 2514.98]  Hey!
[2514.98 --> 2515.98]  Okay.
[2515.98 --> 2517.98]  Totally changing the subject.
[2517.98 --> 2520.98]  Why did we stop calling them PMs?
[2520.98 --> 2522.98]  Why are they DMs?
[2522.98 --> 2526.98]  Because they aren't always direct one-to-one, but they're always private.
[2528.98 --> 2530.98]  What the fuck?
[2530.98 --> 2531.98]  I don't understand it.
[2531.98 --> 2532.98]  Group chats?
[2532.98 --> 2536.98]  I am a boomer and still call them PMs pretty often.
[2536.98 --> 2537.98]  Or...
[2537.98 --> 2539.98]  No, you're converted.
[2539.98 --> 2541.98]  No, I was just thinking about it too much.
[2541.98 --> 2542.98]  PMs pretty often.
[2542.98 --> 2543.98]  I think sometimes it also...
[2543.98 --> 2544.98]  Also, Luke, you muted again.
[2544.98 --> 2545.98]  I need to fix something.
[2545.98 --> 2546.98]  What's going on?
[2546.98 --> 2547.98]  Oh, Luke's muted.
[2547.98 --> 2548.98]  Got him.
[2548.98 --> 2549.98]  Okay, well...
[2549.98 --> 2550.98]  Context!
[2550.98 --> 2551.98]  I fixed it.
[2551.98 --> 2554.98]  Like in video games, I still call them whispers.
[2554.98 --> 2555.98]  Right.
[2555.98 --> 2556.98]  Cool.
[2556.98 --> 2558.98]  Uh, apparently it's fixed now.
[2558.98 --> 2561.98]  But like, I bet you if I was on Twitter, I would call it a DM.
[2561.98 --> 2562.98]  Cause everyone calls it DMs on Twitter.
[2562.98 --> 2563.98]  Yeah.
[2563.98 --> 2565.98]  So I think it's the context of the platform.
[2565.98 --> 2568.98]  And you'd never say like, like, slide into your PMs.
[2568.98 --> 2569.98]  That's a little weird.
[2569.98 --> 2571.98]  Yeah, it sounds like slide into your night.
[2571.98 --> 2572.98]  Yeah.
[2572.98 --> 2574.98]  Which, I mean realistically is probably a similar intent.
[2574.98 --> 2575.98]  Might be the same deal.
[2575.98 --> 2576.98]  Yeah.
[2576.98 --> 2580.98]  But like, I feel like if you're on the forum, you call it private messages.
[2580.98 --> 2581.98]  PM.
[2581.98 --> 2582.98]  Yeah.
[2582.98 --> 2583.98]  If you're on Twitter, you call it DMs.
[2583.98 --> 2584.98]  Well that's stupid.
[2584.98 --> 2585.98]  If you're in a video game, you call it whispers.
[2585.98 --> 2586.98]  Functionally, they're all the same thing.
[2586.98 --> 2587.98]  Pretty much.
[2587.98 --> 2588.98]  Anyway.
[2588.98 --> 2589.98]  Except whispers.
[2589.98 --> 2590.98]  But...
[2590.98 --> 2592.98]  Handy Daily Deliverables.
[2592.98 --> 2593.98]  HDD.
[2593.98 --> 2596.98]  The acronym is good, but the...
[2596.98 --> 2597.98]  Handy.
[2597.98 --> 2598.98]  So, yeah.
[2598.98 --> 2600.98]  The alliteration of merch messages is really good.
[2600.98 --> 2604.98]  I mean, okay, would it satisfy you if we just changed it to merchandise messages?
[2604.98 --> 2605.98]  Like, I'm...
[2605.98 --> 2606.98]  Pfft.
[2606.98 --> 2607.98]  Cause merch is just short for merchandise.
[2607.98 --> 2608.98]  How about...
[2608.98 --> 2609.98]  How about...
[2609.98 --> 2610.98]  Perch messages?
[2610.98 --> 2611.98]  I'm tired of the like...
[2611.98 --> 2612.98]  Perch messages?
[2612.98 --> 2613.98]  Yeah, like purchase.
[2613.98 --> 2614.98]  Perch messages?
[2614.98 --> 2615.98]  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.
[2615.98 --> 2616.98]  So affordable.
[2616.98 --> 2617.98]  Now they're PMs.
[2617.98 --> 2618.98]  Perch.
[2618.98 --> 2619.98]  P-E-R-C-H?
[2619.98 --> 2621.98]  Yeah, you gotta send us a PM.
[2621.98 --> 2623.98]  A perch message.
[2623.98 --> 2626.98]  I don't know.
[2626.98 --> 2629.98]  I am forever calling them additional live purchase comments.
[2629.98 --> 2633.98]  I keep reading threads where someone's like, oh, like, I bought the screwdriver and it's
[2633.98 --> 2636.98]  like the best screwdriver I've ever used and I'm totally converted.
[2636.98 --> 2640.98]  So surprised considering it's YouTuber merch and I'm just like, oh!
[2640.98 --> 2641.98]  Yeah.
[2641.98 --> 2642.98]  I know.
[2642.98 --> 2648.98]  It's painful because that's for a lot of people, the foot that we have in the door.
[2648.98 --> 2649.98]  Yes.
[2649.98 --> 2651.98]  To get them to try it.
[2651.98 --> 2653.98]  Instead of it just being a good product.
[2653.98 --> 2654.98]  Yeah.
[2654.98 --> 2655.98]  Which it is.
[2655.98 --> 2663.98]  And then everyone's is like, it's good for being, they'll say in the same grouping of
[2663.98 --> 2668.98]  text, they'll say like, this is the best one ever and it's good for being a merch product.
[2668.98 --> 2671.98]  And those things sound so different.
[2671.98 --> 2672.98]  They're separate.
[2672.98 --> 2673.98]  They're really very different things.
[2673.98 --> 2674.98]  Ugh.
[2674.98 --> 2676.98]  I don't know.
[2676.98 --> 2682.98]  I bet it wouldn't even take me that long to find, to find a comment like that.
[2682.98 --> 2683.98]  Like that.
[2683.98 --> 2684.98]  Yeah.
[2684.98 --> 2685.98]  They're all over the place.
[2685.98 --> 2689.98]  Because I don't necessarily think that people understand what the takeaway from that is
[2689.98 --> 2691.98]  for like us.
[2691.98 --> 2692.98]  You know what I mean?
[2692.98 --> 2693.98]  Um, I don't know.
[2693.98 --> 2695.98]  I think I'm just kind of over it at this point.
[2695.98 --> 2701.98]  I, uh, no, I'm not like I get it, but I also just, um, swag chats.
[2701.98 --> 2703.98]  Swag is worse in this context.
[2703.98 --> 2704.98]  Oh yeah.
[2704.98 --> 2705.98]  Swag stuff.
[2705.98 --> 2708.98]  We all get means just like garbage Aliexpress stuff that is rebranded.
[2708.98 --> 2710.98]  It's a lot worse.
[2710.98 --> 2711.98]  We can leave it.
[2711.98 --> 2713.98]  It's just, I don't know.
[2713.98 --> 2720.98]  I just, I want creator warehouse to be able to break out of the, the bubble, um, that they
[2720.98 --> 2724.98]  get put in with a lot of other creator merch.
[2724.98 --> 2729.98]  Well, what's really frustrating for me is that, um, if, if they don't belong there,
[2729.98 --> 2736.98]  if more people used creator warehouse, then more merch would be merchandise instead of
[2736.98 --> 2737.98]  being merch.
[2737.98 --> 2743.98]  Um, but I mean, realistically, I say that, but we'd have to open the doors.
[2743.98 --> 2747.98]  We don't really have the capacity to take on, uh, other creators anyway.
[2747.98 --> 2749.98]  Like we still have, we still have a lot to learn.
[2749.98 --> 2750.98]  Some of them want it.
[2750.98 --> 2752.98]  I know real bad.
[2752.98 --> 2753.98]  I know.
[2753.98 --> 2757.98]  Luke, every time he tries to pitch float plane to a creator, they're like, okay, neat.
[2757.98 --> 2760.98]  But, um, by the way, what about that other thing you guys do?
[2760.98 --> 2761.98]  Yeah.
[2761.98 --> 2762.98]  Can I get in on that?
[2762.98 --> 2767.98]  And it's like, um, I think that the, and I also just, I think the creator warehouse
[2767.98 --> 2770.98]  model is inherently incompatible with a lot of creators.
[2770.98 --> 2779.98]  I have tried to, I don't know if I had this conversation with you, but the most recent one that we had that conversation with, which they, they're theoretically joining flow plane as well.
[2779.98 --> 2781.98]  But they are also having this conversation.
[2781.98 --> 2785.98]  I, I tried to like talk them down actively this time.
[2785.98 --> 2786.98]  I was like, I wonder what that'll be.
[2786.98 --> 2793.98]  So I started going over like all the, the, I don't know if I want to say downsides, all the difficulties of doing it the way that we do.
[2793.98 --> 2794.98]  Yeah.
[2794.98 --> 2799.98]  Where you have to like hold inventory and pay for things upfront with no net terms.
[2799.98 --> 2802.98]  And like, oh, they were like, it's a hyper risky.
[2802.98 --> 2803.98]  Oh no, I totally understand.
[2803.98 --> 2804.98]  Want to do it that way.
[2804.98 --> 2805.98]  Sounds good.
[2805.98 --> 2806.98]  No problem.
[2807.98 --> 2812.98]  And throughout a number of like, yeah, I expect like getting inventory for this stuff would like costs about this amount.
[2812.98 --> 2813.98]  And I was like, wow.
[2813.98 --> 2814.98]  Yep.
[2814.98 --> 2819.98]  Uh, that sounds probably about accurate, including like R and D involved and everything else.
[2819.98 --> 2823.98]  It's like, okay, this is a, sounds good.
[2823.98 --> 2827.98]  I think a really positive example of a similar thing.
[2827.98 --> 2829.98]  I've been looking for a screwdriver like this one for years.
[2829.98 --> 2832.98]  I don't care about this being a YouTuber product.
[2832.98 --> 2833.98]  It's something special.
[2833.98 --> 2835.98]  Do yourself a favor and pick up one or two.
[2835.98 --> 2836.98]  Yeah.
[2836.98 --> 2838.98]  Like I don't, I don't mind it in that context.
[2838.98 --> 2839.98]  I do agree.
[2839.98 --> 2841.98]  But there's absolutely ones like Luke said.
[2841.98 --> 2842.98]  Not usually like that.
[2842.98 --> 2843.98]  Yeah.
[2843.98 --> 2844.98]  That's okay.
[2844.98 --> 2845.98]  That's okay.
[2845.98 --> 2846.98]  I mean, yeah, I, with how long.
[2846.98 --> 2847.98]  Shop talk.
[2847.98 --> 2848.98]  Shop talk.
[2848.98 --> 2851.98]  Oh, shop talk.
[2851.98 --> 2852.98]  No.
[2852.98 --> 2855.98]  That has a super negative connotation.
[2855.98 --> 2856.98]  I think so.
[2856.98 --> 2859.98]  Um, it's sound, it, the flow is good.
[2859.98 --> 2865.98]  And as much as like, you know, I never shy away from an innuendo, like our verified actual
[2865.98 --> 2873.98]  gamer program, you're banned from like saying, saying, yeah, you have to, you have to say
[2873.98 --> 2876.98]  the full name verified actual gamer program.
[2876.98 --> 2877.98]  Shop talk.
[2877.98 --> 2878.98]  Shop talk.
[2878.98 --> 2879.98]  Yeah.
[2879.98 --> 2880.98]  Well, it's like locker room talk.
[2880.98 --> 2882.98]  Like, oh yeah.
[2882.98 --> 2888.98]  Like it, the, the, the, like, is that a, just, just the boys, you know, kind of, yeah, I
[2888.98 --> 2891.98]  think it, I think it has a pretty, I think it has kind of a toxic connotation.
[2891.98 --> 2892.98]  I'm probably just disconnected from this.
[2892.98 --> 2893.98]  I don't know.
[2893.98 --> 2894.98]  Yeah.
[2894.98 --> 2895.98]  I've never heard of it.
[2895.98 --> 2897.98]  Just go dumb with it and call them peepee poo-poos.
[2897.98 --> 2898.98]  I mean, honestly.
[2898.98 --> 2902.98]  Purchase PMs, you know, peepees.
[2902.98 --> 2903.98]  All right.
[2903.98 --> 2907.98]  I got a big peepee here from, you know, maybe not.
[2907.98 --> 2910.98]  Purchase merch.
[2910.98 --> 2913.98]  No, you can't say merch.
[2913.98 --> 2915.98]  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[2915.98 --> 2918.98]  Additional live purchase comment.
[2918.98 --> 2921.98]  We're not doing that, Dan.
[2921.98 --> 2922.98]  Stop trying to make.
[2922.98 --> 2923.98]  Conrad's in chat.
[2923.98 --> 2927.98]  He's like, I'm so down replacing all the coffee with peepee poo-poos now.
[2927.98 --> 2931.98]  Why is my dashboard changing?
[2931.98 --> 2936.98]  The reply button just says poop.
[2936.98 --> 2940.98]  Man, I love, I love NoJans.
[2940.98 --> 2941.98]  Okay, hold on.
[2941.98 --> 2944.98]  You put it to reply and then you pee it for us to reply?
[2944.98 --> 2945.98]  Show it, unzip.
[2945.98 --> 2950.98]  I see here, people here saying, talking shop means something else entirely.
[2950.98 --> 2951.98]  Yeah.
[2951.98 --> 2952.98]  That's MLiper89.
[2952.98 --> 2953.98]  That's totally fine.
[2953.98 --> 2954.98]  That's totally fine.
[2954.98 --> 2959.98]  I mean, other than that people like, often don't like it because you're supposed to be in
[2959.98 --> 2962.98]  a social context and you're talking shop.
[2962.98 --> 2964.98]  Like that's, that's usually the context that I hear that in.
[2964.98 --> 2966.98]  Can we not talk shop right now?
[2966.98 --> 2967.98]  Like that kind of thing.
[2967.98 --> 2968.98]  Talking about work outside of work.
[2968.98 --> 2969.98]  Yeah.
[2969.98 --> 2970.98]  Yeah.
[2970.98 --> 2971.98]  That's talking shop.
[2971.98 --> 2972.98]  Which never bothers me.
[2972.98 --> 2974.98]  But I understand.
[2974.98 --> 2975.98]  Yeah.
[2975.98 --> 2976.98]  I know.
[2976.98 --> 2977.98]  I don't care jobs, Luke.
[2977.98 --> 2979.98]  It's, my job is my whole life.
[2979.98 --> 2980.98]  So I literally don't.
[2980.98 --> 2981.98]  I think that's why it doesn't bother me.
[2981.98 --> 2982.98]  I never really turn off.
[2982.98 --> 2985.98]  I don't have other things to talk to people about.
[2985.98 --> 2990.98]  And realistically, because of my job, it's usually what people want to talk to me about
[2990.98 --> 2991.98]  anyway.
[2991.98 --> 2995.98]  So what is the point of me even like, do people want to hear about my cats?
[2995.98 --> 2999.98]  I mean, some do, but like tone down the parasocial relationship.
[2999.98 --> 3001.98]  Like a lot of people ask what my birds do.
[3001.98 --> 3002.98]  Yeah.
[3002.98 --> 3003.98]  Yeah, that's true.
[3003.98 --> 3005.98]  And I don't actually have a problem with that.
[3005.98 --> 3008.98]  I like talking about my cats, but I just mean usually when I run into someone at a social
[3008.98 --> 3011.98]  function, they're like, okay, whose dad are you?
[3011.98 --> 3017.98]  Like, you know, which, which sniveling, you know, snot nosed crying creature, you know,
[3017.98 --> 3023.98]  belongs to, you know, came out of or, or into, you know, your various guy or lady parts,
[3023.98 --> 3024.98]  right?
[3024.98 --> 3027.98]  Like it's, it's basically which critters yours essentially.
[3027.98 --> 3030.98]  Um, and, and then they're like, okay, yeah.
[3030.98 --> 3031.98]  So like, what do you do?
[3031.98 --> 3040.98]  And I'm like, Oh, I, I usually I try to not, I try to say I work in media or I take, I make
[3040.98 --> 3041.98]  videos.
[3041.98 --> 3042.98]  I do tech.
[3042.98 --> 3043.98]  Yeah.
[3043.98 --> 3044.98]  Okay.
[3044.98 --> 3045.98]  That's more true for you than it is for me.
[3045.98 --> 3048.98]  I try to give a true answer that doesn't sort of, I make them pry.
[3048.98 --> 3049.98]  On paper only sort of.
[3049.98 --> 3050.98]  Oh, what do you mean?
[3050.98 --> 3051.98]  Then I'll be like, Oh, okay.
[3051.98 --> 3053.98]  I mean, I make YouTube videos.
[3053.98 --> 3056.98]  Cause I'm pretty sure you're still actually a CEO.
[3056.98 --> 3057.98]  Yeah.
[3057.98 --> 3058.98]  Yeah.
[3058.98 --> 3062.98]  Technically I might technically still be more than one CEO.
[3062.98 --> 3063.98]  I'm not sure.
[3063.98 --> 3068.98]  Oh, cause don't, don't forget about all the companies that like are not like the normal
[3068.98 --> 3069.98]  companies.
[3069.98 --> 3070.98]  Okay.
[3070.98 --> 3072.98]  But you're a CEO of a company that has employees.
[3072.98 --> 3073.98]  Yeah.
[3073.98 --> 3074.98]  Yeah.
[3074.98 --> 3075.98]  I know.
[3075.98 --> 3076.98]  Yeah.
[3076.98 --> 3077.98]  Yeah.
[3077.98 --> 3078.98]  I'm technically still the CEO of float plane, but that is such horse.
[3078.98 --> 3082.98]  So I remember when you told me one day that it was going to be me and I was like, yeah,
[3082.98 --> 3083.98]  sure.
[3083.98 --> 3088.98]  I mean, look, if you want the promotion, go talk to my boss.
[3088.98 --> 3090.98]  No, it's fine.
[3090.98 --> 3091.98]  I don't really care.
[3091.98 --> 3093.98]  I just do all the things.
[3093.98 --> 3094.98]  Yeah.
[3094.98 --> 3095.98]  Pretty much.
[3095.98 --> 3096.98]  Pretty much.
[3096.98 --> 3100.98]  Um, call them product placements.
[3100.98 --> 3101.98]  Hmm.
[3101.98 --> 3106.98]  That's kind of interesting because they buy a product, they place their message.
[3106.98 --> 3107.98]  Product placements.
[3107.98 --> 3108.98]  Yeah.
[3108.98 --> 3109.98]  That's not bad.
[3109.98 --> 3110.98]  I always like alliteration.
[3110.98 --> 3111.98]  PPs.
[3111.98 --> 3112.98]  Yeah.
[3112.98 --> 3113.98]  So it doesn't, it doesn't.
[3113.98 --> 3114.98]  No, I kind of like it.
[3114.98 --> 3115.98]  PP is super on brand.
[3115.98 --> 3116.98]  Yeah.
[3116.98 --> 3119.98]  I think I was talking to somebody else about that today because I'm deploying this thing,
[3119.98 --> 3121.98]  but it's for production and it's going into production.
[3121.98 --> 3123.98]  So it's the production production.
[3123.98 --> 3126.98]  And then we have LTX Expo, which is the Linus Tech Expo Expo.
[3126.98 --> 3127.98]  And we have.
[3127.98 --> 3128.98]  Whale LAN.
[3128.98 --> 3129.98]  We hosted a LAN event LAN event.
[3129.98 --> 3130.98]  Yeah.
[3130.98 --> 3131.98]  The Whale LAN event.
[3131.98 --> 3132.98]  That's pretty good too.
[3132.98 --> 3133.98]  Right?
[3133.98 --> 3134.98]  So.
[3134.98 --> 3135.98]  This one's pretty good too.
[3135.98 --> 3136.98]  Uh, RAM.
[3136.98 --> 3137.98]  Yeah.
[3137.98 --> 3138.98]  Random audience message.
[3138.98 --> 3139.98]  That's the one I just reacted to.
[3139.98 --> 3140.98]  That's not bad.
[3140.98 --> 3141.98]  That's pretty good.
[3141.98 --> 3142.98]  We could stop letting, we could stop.
[3142.98 --> 3143.98]  All right.
[3143.98 --> 3144.98]  I think that's enough show for me for today.
[3144.98 --> 3145.98]  It was so fast.
[3145.98 --> 3146.98]  It's been a really nice Friday.
[3146.98 --> 3147.98]  I had a great week.
[3147.98 --> 3148.98]  Um, I've enjoyed it.
[3148.98 --> 3149.98]  You can't go off camera after he says that.
[3149.98 --> 3150.98]  I've enjoyed it.
[3150.98 --> 3151.98]  You can't go off camera to where he is also off camera.
[3151.98 --> 3152.98]  No!
[3152.98 --> 3153.98]  Stop!
[3153.98 --> 3154.98]  Stop!
[3154.98 --> 3155.98]  Subscribe now for only $15.99 per month.
[3155.98 --> 3156.98]  Oh my god.
[3156.98 --> 3157.98]  When are we starting?
[3157.98 --> 3160.98]  When are we starting OnlyPlanes.com again?
[3160.98 --> 3161.98]  Uh, not today cause we had to ban people making those links.
[3161.98 --> 3162.98]  Uh, the, uh, I'm not blushing.
[3162.98 --> 3163.98]  You're blushing.
[3163.98 --> 3164.98]  I think we do.
[3164.98 --> 3165.98]  OnlyPlanes?
[3165.98 --> 3166.98]  I don't remember.
[3166.98 --> 3167.98]  I don't remember.
[3167.98 --> 3168.98]  I don't remember.
[3168.98 --> 3169.98]  I don't remember.
[3169.98 --> 3170.98]  I don't remember.
[3170.98 --> 3171.98]  I'm pretty sure we own OnlyPlanes.com.
[3171.98 --> 3172.98]  I feel like we probably did, but don't go check.
[3172.98 --> 3173.98]  Yeah, don't check.
[3173.98 --> 3174.98]  Um, oh my goodness.
[3174.98 --> 3175.98]  Sorry!
[3175.98 --> 3176.98]  Just blurted out.
[3176.98 --> 3177.98]  It was so fast.
[3177.98 --> 3178.98]  Yeah, wow.
[3178.98 --> 3179.98]  I didn't have time for my brain to think about that.
[3179.98 --> 3180.98]  Sorry.
[3180.98 --> 3181.98]  That's not sometimes a lot of the best things happen.
[3181.98 --> 3182.98]  Right.
[3182.98 --> 3183.98]  Um, I don't know.
[3183.98 --> 3184.98]  I mean, I don't know.
[3184.98 --> 3185.98]  I need to be as simple as I'm gonna be as simple as I'm going to be.
[3185.98 --> 3186.98]  I'm a little bit more.
[3186.98 --> 3187.98]  I don't know.
[3187.98 --> 3188.98]  I don't know, but I don't know.
[3188.98 --> 3189.98]  You're right.
[3189.98 --> 3190.98]  And I don't know.
[3190.98 --> 3191.98]  You're not going to be as simple as I'm going to be.
[3191.98 --> 3192.98]  You're not going to be as simple as I'm going to be.
[3192.98 --> 3193.98]  I'm going to be as simple as I'm going to be.
[3193.98 --> 3200.70]  blurted out it was so fast yeah i didn't have time for my brain to think about that sorry
[3200.70 --> 3206.02]  that's sometimes a lot of the best blush will calm down soon yeah okay get through some bps
[3206.02 --> 3211.76]  oh we apparently do not own only planes so okay i think that was because we decided we were going
[3211.76 --> 3216.60]  to call it something else oh yeah that's right because it's kind of a terrible name yeah i mean
[3216.60 --> 3222.66]  yeah it makes absolutely no sense not at all yeah um what what are we supposed to be talking about
[3222.66 --> 3227.76]  right now you're supposed to explain what a merch message is oh right yeah and then we read one
[3227.76 --> 3233.14]  uh merch messages are the way to interact with the show um actually no i'm gonna i'm gonna call
[3233.14 --> 3238.26]  them product purchases or product product checkout chats i like checkout chats a lot oh checkout
[3238.26 --> 3246.36]  and conrad coined it i'm sold it's almost like having you know people who you pay and who are
[3246.36 --> 3251.92]  smart and who like do things for a living highly technically competent it's better than just listening
[3251.92 --> 3257.80]  to your audience he also named it fuss um that's a good name shut up free upsell shelf yeah that's
[3257.80 --> 3263.46]  not as good i mean but i mean that's that's the thing it's an internal name check out chats you only
[3263.46 --> 3269.00]  i'm an endless defender of internal names being basically whatever you want as long as you can
[3269.00 --> 3274.78]  differentiate between what the things are and fuss has always been very clear on for our team so it's
[3274.78 --> 3280.46]  been fine it's not clear it's gonna stay fuss so dumb it's never okay checkout chats okay checkout chats
[3280.46 --> 3287.58]  uh so if you want to send a checkout chat all you've got to do is uh go to ltdstore.com so
[3287.58 --> 3292.30]  instead of doing super chats or twitch bits or anything like that where you throw money at your
[3292.30 --> 3297.24]  screen you get nothing in return we have checkout chats so you go to ltdstore.com add something to
[3297.24 --> 3301.84]  your cart oh cart chats maybe i don't know and the point is it's in the cart not the checkout which is
[3301.84 --> 3306.78]  part of the checkout doesn't matter the point is the checkout process when we're live there'll be a
[3306.78 --> 3313.20]  box in the cart you fill that out and it'll go to producer dan i still like checkout chats better
[3313.20 --> 3319.10]  it'll go to producer dan who will pop it down there uh like if you have a shout out for your mom or
[3319.10 --> 3324.90]  you know your brother or whatever if it's your birthday something cool like that uh dan will forward
[3324.90 --> 3328.30]  it to someone internal who can answer your questions sometimes dan will answer questions
[3328.30 --> 3333.80]  himself and other times he will curate your checkout chats oh we got all the c's wansfers
[3333.80 --> 3341.38]  it's not always wanshow um sometimes he will curate your checkout chats and he will
[3341.38 --> 3345.70]  give them to us so that i can say ram me dan and
[3345.70 --> 3348.76]  and he will
[3348.76 --> 3359.52]  people are saying that we should we should keep the out in the acronym check out chats
[3359.52 --> 3368.40]  okay why oh stop i'm saying people are saying that i'm not i'm not i'm not saying that myself
[3368.40 --> 3373.76]  the the some of the the people have been saying that and then if we have like a checkout chat counter
[3373.76 --> 3378.02]  then we could spell it with a k yes like is that is that really where you're going with this should
[3378.02 --> 3384.08]  i not me should i just not me should i just stop leaving any ambiguity here we're gonna call them
[3384.08 --> 3390.44]  Dan me
[3390.44 --> 3398.88]  i've had a lot of practice over the last year so uh yeah um all right i've got an additional live
[3398.88 --> 3402.44]  purchase comment also known as a checkout chat also known as a merch message here from thomas
[3402.44 --> 3408.32]  okay uh sorry no they're not from thomas somebody else uh hello dan and the photon reflectors i used
[3408.32 --> 3413.94]  your ai support bot last week was that in response to the secret shopper video or in the works longer
[3413.94 --> 3419.74]  kudos for including i need a person escape hatch that's a that's a dashboard thing from them but i
[3419.74 --> 3424.84]  think it was in the works for a lot longer i had heard about it yeah way long time ago basically
[3424.84 --> 3431.68]  i think if you go back to the wan show where chat gpt like went public beta or whatever
[3431.68 --> 3439.56]  um i think we probably talked about like support chat bots being becoming way better and we probably
[3439.56 --> 3444.18]  like talked about it on that show or shortly after that yeah i think they had been kind of riffing on
[3444.18 --> 3448.78]  the idea for a while i'm i'm 99 sure and that's that's just the creative warehouse team working with
[3448.78 --> 3453.20]  um their their customer support tool provider yeah um yeah
[3453.20 --> 3460.98]  and how about uh what are there really that just something conrad said dan are there really that
[3460.98 --> 3465.46]  no i just have a backlog today okay there's still like 30 in income he's been busy ramming
[3465.46 --> 3469.84]  there's been a lot of interruptions but i got some more here okay
[3469.84 --> 3479.62]  do you want another one yeah okay i mean i don't know hey when dot dll is it likely that the
[3479.62 --> 3486.98]  commuter back you're not too tired no no i i can go all night just get some water i'm used to doing
[3486.98 --> 3490.26]  this for six hours you know this is this is easy
[3490.26 --> 3508.72]  i hate when dot dll is it likely that the commuter backpack will launch before christmas um likely
[3508.72 --> 3510.26]  i hardly know her
[3510.26 --> 3514.10]  i it doesn't matter
[3514.10 --> 3520.58]  okay
[3520.58 --> 3531.32]  uh i think the hope is to launch it before the end of the year but i think the odds of you getting
[3531.32 --> 3537.06]  one before christmas are basically zero that's that's what i'll that's what i'll say with confidence
[3537.06 --> 3541.12]  launch a little bit too late for shipping to be able to line up i think so it might even be
[3541.12 --> 3547.28]  launching after christmas shirts yet no it's dude do you have any idea how long production and
[3547.28 --> 3552.00]  shipping takes i don't care i just want it i know but it doesn't think it doesn't work that way this
[3552.00 --> 3558.64]  is the whole one it look this is the whole thing where our model like doesn't work for creator merch
[3558.64 --> 3563.60]  because we're just if something goes out of stock if we gap out on something we're out of it for like
[3563.60 --> 3568.54]  four months we don't we're not just buying fruit of the loom t-shirts from some local distribution
[3568.54 --> 3575.16]  warehouse like we we make stuff the worst part of this is that i i i was like i feel like i have a
[3575.16 --> 3583.18]  dealer and now i'm in like forms of withdrawal because now i only have two shirts the first hit
[3583.18 --> 3589.32]  was free and now i put on any other shirt at all and i'm just like wow this is notably inadequate
[3589.32 --> 3595.68]  where is my proper shirt but then doing laundry like literally every day because i only have one
[3595.68 --> 3599.92]  short sleeve one i don't want to wear long sleeves every other day so doing laundry literally every
[3599.92 --> 3607.94]  day for a shirt it gets a little nuts by the way before any of you try to solve his problem oh and
[3607.94 --> 3616.68]  send him a shirt i thank you so much for the thought i appreciate the gesture the person who it was very
[3616.68 --> 3624.70]  kind who bought some of our tall shirts packaged them back up from overseas and sent them back to
[3624.70 --> 3631.66]  luke overseas shipping and everything unfortunately they were not luke size and also you don't have to
[3631.66 --> 3637.90]  do that he gets as much merch as he wants yeah it's fine did you send them back i haven't yet but i will
[3637.90 --> 3645.56]  be okay yeah super nice thought but um don't do that he's he's just whining i appreciate the concern
[3645.56 --> 3650.54]  he doesn't actually want anyone to solve this problem but yeah part of the type
[3650.54 --> 3657.62]  i'm kidding i love you i'm trying to hype the shirts up because i want them to keep doing well
[3657.62 --> 3663.06]  because i have a personal vested interest in the tall shirts doing well because if the tall shirt's
[3663.06 --> 3668.66]  doing well there's a higher chance that we'll do more colors printed versions more colors so like i
[3668.66 --> 3673.18]  want to keep kind of reminding people that they exist and they're awesome yeah yeah yeah because it's good
[3673.18 --> 3678.56]  for me yeah we're on it we're on it and i i think genuinely a lot of people that don't really fit in
[3678.56 --> 3684.10]  normal shirts very well don't even necessarily know that there's like an alternative yeah to like
[3684.10 --> 3690.00]  having their belly poke out every time they lift up their arms honestly yeah so yeah um all right
[3690.00 --> 3697.08]  should we yeah should we do announcements finally uh yeah let's do that announcing black friday cyber
[3697.08 --> 3702.94]  monday 9 000 it's our big freaking black friday and cyber monday event not only are we going to have

[3728.84 --> 3739.82]  actor i was like is that right because it is an absolutely smoking deal uh i had a colleague i had

[3932.66 --> 3938.54]  window open yes the window's open did they really in the rain did they really when they did the i wasn't
[3938.54 --> 3942.38]  there for the towing stuff did they did they really it's the window open in the rain uh okay
[3942.38 --> 3954.70]  hmm we uh oh shoot okay um anyway uh okay anyway it's um yeah it's uh it's a me and me and dan video

[3968.66 --> 3975.50]  and it's it's it's cooler tech than it sounds like all right is this movie magic you didn't even see
[3975.50 --> 3979.86]  it happen you didn't see it get towed i did see it get towed but not when i was filming that shot oh
[3979.86 --> 3985.12]  yeah yeah because that would have been like kind of a hassle because it was like out on the street
[3985.12 --> 3989.06]  and the audio is terrible and stuff yeah that's the whole thing uh but yeah no i was i was there when
[3989.06 --> 3995.04]  they towed it it's pretty funny sorry sorry i was there i saw the tow truck pull in but then i was
[3995.04 --> 3999.08]  like having a meeting did they not actually like take it they just like moved it for a shot yeah yeah
[3999.08 --> 4007.82]  yeah yeah yeah yeah um okay look it's a dan remember that one time when you had to undo all of the audio
[4007.82 --> 4013.92]  stuff and then redo it again and then undo it and then redo it again was that fun dan where on earth
[4013.92 --> 4020.90]  was that oh that was like the first one last week the first one we did last week no for the the all
[4020.90 --> 4030.26]  hands oh god did you i blocked that out that was so stressful you did an inside out too and just like
[4030.26 --> 4040.58]  just uh throw that into the void no that was brutal um but it worked i guess someone said uh shyster is a
[4040.58 --> 4045.64]  bad word just fyi is it i'm not aware of it someone else posted the definition it's considered a
[4045.64 --> 4049.48]  negative slang term that can be offensive and derogatory but used to describe someone who's
[4049.48 --> 4053.74]  unethical dishonest or unscrupulous especially in the practice of law politics or economics
[4053.74 --> 4058.74]  for example you might call a used car salesperson a shyster if they tell you a car is one price but
[4058.74 --> 4063.52]  the fine print reveals a higher price like i'm not aware that it has any kind of like like racial or
[4063.52 --> 4069.56]  gender or like whatever um connotation so i was know that it does yeah i don't i don't think so
[4069.56 --> 4075.32]  not that not that i'm aware of i mean there's always new there's always new words that i you
[4075.32 --> 4081.14]  know i'm finding out for the first time have some kind of connotation like i had no idea that uh you
[4081.14 --> 4086.86]  know the function someone just said it's anti-semi but there's there's a there's a link on law.com
[4086.86 --> 4092.06]  that i mean currently goes to a 404 page but it says it's not yeah it's not a 404 page anymore
[4092.06 --> 4100.82]  i'm not i'm not aware of that being that so if it is i had no idea i mean dude there's there's at a
[4100.82 --> 4105.48]  certain point like there's all kinds of stuff that i just i just like don't know like i okay you know
[4105.48 --> 4113.20]  the the the main selling point of our screwdriver i had no idea that that in the context of something
[4113.20 --> 4119.88]  that's like shoddily done had like uh like a super can i say it maybe just don't but i had no idea
[4119.88 --> 4126.52]  that it had this like super racial undertones in certain contexts yeah so i knew it yeah okay we use
[4126.52 --> 4133.88]  that word here to describe like something that's kind of shoddy like shantytown and or like cobbled
[4133.88 --> 4141.18]  together um and then uh we we used it in a video at some point to describe something alex made
[4141.18 --> 4150.32]  you know um and people were like like really upset about like i have no idea it's so i don't know
[4150.32 --> 4156.72]  i don't think i'm just getting old maybe it's a combination okay i'll i'll concede that it might
[4156.72 --> 4160.90]  be a combination but things just actually move too fast these days and there's too many words and
[4160.90 --> 4167.28]  too many things to keep track of it's like actually difficult it is it is legitimately difficult i i and
[4167.28 --> 4172.40]  at a certain point you gotta just i try my best yeah um you gotta understand that not everyone's
[4172.40 --> 4179.18]  gonna know the like weird secret alternative hidden meaning of every single weird random word
[4179.18 --> 4183.86]  like i don't know some there's there's you gotta understand intention behind certain things you know
[4183.86 --> 4189.74]  i don't know i think you're asking a lot i think so but it still like needs to and i'm asking a lot

[4370.68 --> 4375.72]  oh my god
[4375.72 --> 4386.38]  more topics sure uh yeah get us out of here uh sony employees talking about that one sure sony
[4386.38 --> 4393.48]  employees allegedly selling personal data of users in a recent 23 minute instagram video guinness record
[4393.48 --> 4401.96]  holding trophy hunter hakum has claimed that his user data was sold on telegram's black market by sony
[4401.96 --> 4411.88]  employees hakum has over 207 000 trophies including 7 311 platinums wow that's a lot there's a note here
[4411.88 --> 4419.48]  i'm gonna read it verbatim these are not my words dumb ps fanboy david i think david actually wrote that so
[4419.48 --> 4425.00]  i just that's why i'm saying it uh has less than 3 000 total trophies and three platinums for reference
[4426.76 --> 4435.88]  wow whoa so buddy has literally am i reading this correctly 7311 platinums means two thousand times
[4435.88 --> 4441.96]  the number of platinum trophies as dumb playstation fanboy david yeah a little bit more
[4443.64 --> 4449.32]  it is is am i correct platinum means you you got every trophy for the game i think they're just you know
[4449.32 --> 4455.32]  some of the harder trophies okay um and a platinum trophy might also include get every other trophy
[4455.32 --> 4461.88]  i'm sorry i i i don't know because digital trophies for playing a game are not real awards
[4464.04 --> 4468.28]  hot take controversial i think some of them can be fun to go after i i didn't say they're not fun
[4468.84 --> 4475.88]  but games are meant to be fun and if it isn't fun then it challenge can be fun sure
[4475.88 --> 4482.60]  i'm sorry i'm i i i am oh boy
[4485.40 --> 4494.28]  should we just move on there are more important i feel that there are more important things to feel a
[4494.28 --> 4498.44]  sense of achievement over are you being that reporter talking about the the tetris kid
[4498.44 --> 4510.84]  maybe a little bit maybe a little bit but um touch grass that kid though seemed to kind of have his
[4510.84 --> 4516.76]  life together other than being really good at tetris so you don't know that hakum doesn't
[4518.76 --> 4524.04]  no i'm just speaking generally hakum might totally have his life together yeah i'm just saying tetris kid
[4524.04 --> 4528.44]  i wouldn't have said that about tetris kid because i think there was additional context that the
[4528.44 --> 4534.20]  reporter was ignoring like apparently he had like good grades and like like it was was an active kid
[4534.20 --> 4540.28]  who was just really really really friggin good at tetris so i don't know anyways the trouble started
[4540.28 --> 4546.52]  when his uh hakum's psn account or playstation network account got banned in september while trying to
[4546.52 --> 4554.12]  recover his account he got messages with screenshots from a good saudi guy what yeah i think it's saudi
[4554.12 --> 4559.32]  but sure saudi sure uh showing that hakum's personal data and playstation account info was being leaked
[4559.32 --> 4565.88]  on telegram the same source also claimed that the accounts had acquired the info by bribing sony
[4565.88 --> 4570.52]  employees although most of the evidence in the video was blurred to protect hakum that's probably good
[4570.52 --> 4576.20]  um it does include a screenshot of one of the offending seller accounts using an email with the
[4576.20 --> 4584.04]  official polyphony polyphony polyphony polyphony i believe it's how it's pronounced the really
[4584.04 --> 4591.88]  polyphony the game studio i don't know uh digital domain the maker of gran turismo okay sure uh he then
[4591.88 --> 4596.92]  started getting calls from one scammer using multiple numbers who claimed to be from sony's customer
[4596.92 --> 4602.44]  service but would eventually ask for hakum's credit card number around the time he got answers from the
[4602.44 --> 4607.32]  real sony who claimed the original ban was due to suspicious activity on his account such as having
[4607.32 --> 4613.80]  multiple playstation devices in different locations uh it's possible he had people helping him get
[4613.80 --> 4621.32]  trophies oh which is against the tos as well as popping platinum trophies after just seconds of gameplay
[4621.32 --> 4633.72]  this is possible both by playing trophy farming games what what or when auto popping by loading a 100 ps4
[4633.72 --> 4651.16]  save into a ps5 game or a 100 save into the save game from a different region what okay why so okay can i go back to my point
[4651.32 --> 4661.00]  none of this is real none of this is going to get you girls uh really there might be one playstation
[4661.00 --> 4667.24]  trophies there might even be two tell you what some could say possibly three you go find them
[4669.80 --> 4675.88]  i could go as far as this box right here next week someone might step up
[4675.88 --> 4688.04]  someone might step up a girl they might who would be like wow you you you slide up next to her at the bar
[4688.60 --> 4695.56]  what up pull out i got 7 311 platinums and playstation check my psn and she's like damn can i go back to
[4695.56 --> 4701.24]  your house to see them maybe really maybe really maybe there's a lot of people out there you don't know
[4701.24 --> 4704.52]  someone in chat says it shows dedication
[4708.44 --> 4709.32]  i'll let you continue
[4716.20 --> 4721.16]  where even was i after two weeks he was ghosty 26 says you won't cheat
[4723.64 --> 4729.24]  uh well i don't know because the the story is claiming that i mean on her because you've got no time
[4729.24 --> 4734.84]  because you're busy playing playstation i mean it's a pretty good argument um after two weeks he
[4734.84 --> 4741.96]  was informed his account would be reinstated after 45 days with strict uh censorship but then there's a
[4741.96 --> 4746.12]  note here saying that i think he means monitoring which makes sense well plain chat is great she'd be a
[4746.12 --> 4746.92]  platinum digger
[4749.88 --> 4754.60]  you guys are great you guys are great why did i ever look at the other chats okay go ahead sorry sorry
[4754.60 --> 4759.40]  although he wasn't informed at the time he had been taken off the press list don't know what that
[4759.40 --> 4766.36]  means uh i wish there was uh more concrete or verifiable proof of the data leaker being a sony employee as
[4768.60 --> 4778.04]  uh i think this is riley text in the doc yeah um as personally i don't think the presented evidence
[4778.04 --> 4783.08]  is sufficient to be 100 damning definitely spooky though and yeah i mean i would agree with that
[4783.08 --> 4788.68]  statement anyway i mean the other part of this this is just kind of one example of how your personal
[4788.68 --> 4795.88]  data is not really that safe um yeah we've seen other examples of this in the past i mean uh tesla
[4795.88 --> 4802.92]  employees famously were swapping uh videos uh that were recorded on people's teslas um if you put personal
[4802.92 --> 4808.76]  information on the internet it's not safe well i mean yeah but there's certain stuff that people
[4808.76 --> 4817.08]  have an expectation should be safe um and another another example that was given was um someone
[4817.08 --> 4823.24]  trying to and and i have no verification of this whatsoever uh but someone trying to find out if
[4823.24 --> 4829.08]  someone was cheating on them and trying to find an employee to give them access to the account to the
[4829.08 --> 4837.16]  email account by bribing them um conceivably there are reasons that certain departments within a company
[4837.16 --> 4843.00]  could have access to just about anything like any department that's in charge for example of
[4843.00 --> 4850.92]  monitoring for um child sexual abuse material see sam could conceivably have access to just about any
[4851.64 --> 4855.64]  dm or pm or email or whatever the case may be
[4859.32 --> 4863.16]  pretty crazy by the way rest assured says me in the ass messages
[4863.16 --> 4865.16]  uh
[4865.16 --> 4868.92]  tried to get him what tried to get him i was saving that you're a little a little bit too late
[4868.92 --> 4872.12]  dang it um i'll get him someday i'm gonna get him someday
[4874.44 --> 4880.12]  all down his shirt it's been a long time i'm gonna but i don't want to bet against that i'm gonna get him
[4881.96 --> 4885.08]  um dan i just got that
[4885.08 --> 4891.64]  go back to your show i'm gonna leave now before i get beat to death
[4891.64 --> 4892.92]  you're getting close
[4895.48 --> 4895.72]  uh
[4897.00 --> 4898.44]  oh my goodness uh
[4900.04 --> 4906.20]  there are discussion questions sure um if 2fa wasn't a thing do you think you could hack into
[4906.20 --> 4908.52]  other hosts accounts and steal their info
[4908.52 --> 4917.48]  um hosts yes accounts like you mean like our like like our hosts i'm assuming here i'm assuming he
[4917.48 --> 4922.68]  means this is a wancho comment i'm assuming he means like us oh yes um
[4922.68 --> 4932.60]  yeah i mean pretty pretty easily honestly this without 2fa like i have for instance i mean am i
[4932.60 --> 4937.48]  allowed to use every tool at my disposal i mean i think so because like i can access
[4937.48 --> 4942.36]  desirable by in fact i think all three of us have access to the surveillance cameras
[4943.16 --> 4950.36]  so all i would have to do is contrive some situation okay set it up where i have you log into
[4950.36 --> 4955.80]  your account sitting like close enough to a camera and i can just like see your password
[4955.80 --> 4960.44]  i'm not gonna go over all the reasons why but literally any account you have would be hilariously
[4960.44 --> 4960.68]  easy
[4964.36 --> 4969.88]  and like these ones and i have literally gained unauthorized access to luke's accounts
[4969.88 --> 4976.36]  before i made a joke do you remember that when i literally logged into one of your accounts or one
[4976.36 --> 4980.20]  of your computers i believe it fully and i was just like you were like huh and i was
[4980.20 --> 4985.32]  like yeah i like guessed your password and you were like right the other day i was making a joke about
[4987.16 --> 4992.68]  like uh anyways i was making a joke that the conclusion was that like someone would need to
[4992.68 --> 4997.48]  be able to access the stuff on my desktop um and someone made the comment of like how would we get
[4997.48 --> 4999.32]  in i was like blindness knows the password
[4999.32 --> 5010.36]  so so yeah i mean you already have it to like some of my stuff yeah so it's it's one of those things
[5010.36 --> 5018.44]  where like the the the easiest way into someone's account is is obviously social engineering yeah and
[5018.44 --> 5023.64]  the better you know someone the more easily you can social engineer do you know how do you know how quickly
[5023.64 --> 5030.20]  and easily i could social engineer luke to type in like a dozen of his passwords all i'd have to do is
[5030.20 --> 5039.16]  is go get an omg cable put a keyboard in front of him and be like okay let's do like a typing challenge
[5039.16 --> 5044.20]  test but i don't want it to be random things i don't want it to be random things so like okay i'll
[5044.20 --> 5050.04]  tell you what just like leave the doc as it is but like type your your most common like type your
[5050.04 --> 5054.84]  type your keeper password and type type this and type that i'd probably sniff that out that's a
[5054.84 --> 5059.08]  little bit i could i could come up with something better than something i'm 100 sure but like
[5059.08 --> 5062.76]  realistically if you have physical access to someone i could just put an omg cable on his
[5062.76 --> 5067.88]  keyboard and then eventually i would find everything yeah i mean it said hosts right so i mean these have
[5067.88 --> 5071.56]  a lot of like extensions and stuff i'm sure you could hide something under the table for sure
[5071.56 --> 5075.80]  never really notice yeah for sure 100 yeah that's why i was so confident in media like we have
[5075.80 --> 5081.16]  physical access to each other's computer yeah so easy like it's over i can see all of your cables from
[5081.16 --> 5087.88]  my desk yeah right yeah super easy yeah yeah it is what it is uh the next one is what can we do to
[5087.88 --> 5093.88]  protect our info against such vulnerabilities as bad actors within a corporation not much um don't don't
[5093.88 --> 5100.44]  share passwords across sites try to try to like lower the the impact of the potential damage use use
[5100.44 --> 5105.32]  autofill autofill is better than typing in passwords because it closes the vulnerability
[5105.32 --> 5110.28]  to a key logger or to an omg cable it's still not perfect but it helps a lot it helps a ton no but it
[5110.28 --> 5119.08]  helps uh yeah and uh record says air gap you can't air gap nothing is air gapped not really yeah
[5120.84 --> 5127.48]  well i mean yes but no yeah but yeah but also no because there's ways to deal with things when
[5127.48 --> 5133.40]  they're air gapped as well i i i i've talked about this before people disagree with me that's fine i i
[5133.40 --> 5138.36]  hate that we use the term air gap for things that aren't quite literally air gapped drives me nuts
[5138.36 --> 5143.40]  there's a there's a company that makes uh network equipment actually pulls it out that like physically
[5143.40 --> 5151.64]  disconnects the port it's pretty crazy um over the management interface um and like i was like does
[5151.64 --> 5158.36]  this really need to exist and then i was like yeah depending on what the level of security that's
[5158.36 --> 5167.16]  required is yeah i i i could i could see i could see an administrator being able to literally remotely
[5167.16 --> 5170.12]  disconnect any port yeah i could see that having a huge value
[5172.68 --> 5181.32]  the anyways moving on we got more stuff yeah what are we talking about um an intel amd merger
[5181.64 --> 5187.24]  is an idea that was reportedly floated by the u.s commerce department um our headline says it might
[5187.24 --> 5194.28]  be less outlandish than it seems but um i actually strongly disagree i think it's i think it's pretty
[5194.28 --> 5202.68]  um i think it's pretty outlandish i also think that the rumors of intel's demise are um have been
[5202.68 --> 5210.12]  grossly uh exaggerated over the last little while like i think it's more a very serious difficult to
[5210.12 --> 5218.12]  properly recover from trip not a fall yeah intel is not intel is not like going out of business
[5218.12 --> 5226.36]  tomorrow also my understanding of they got free coffee now yeah also my understanding of the whole
[5226.36 --> 5233.32]  like x86 license-ness is that actually oh i don't know if intel and amd both agreed yeah i guess there's
[5233.32 --> 5239.96]  no third party that would step in and say no also just as consumers we don't want this having
[5239.96 --> 5247.96]  literally only one x86 company also i just don't see the synergies like amd has their own designs their
[5247.96 --> 5253.56]  own jam their own drum that they're marching to right now they are they're a fabulous company and
[5253.56 --> 5259.32]  they're they're killing it at that and intel for all of their challenges with it over the last few years
[5259.32 --> 5267.00]  years is a fab company and um that is that is their competitive advantage if they can if they can
[5267.00 --> 5274.68]  regain it um and i just i just don't i don't see what they would uh i don't see what they would need
[5274.68 --> 5279.64]  from each other necessarily even um it is worth pointing out that this sort of thing has happened
[5279.64 --> 5285.72]  in the past i think this is from the digitimes article uh lockheed and martin marietta were merged
[5285.72 --> 5292.52]  during the cold war a jp morgan chase acquired bear stearns in 2008 um in 1968 the u.s government
[5292.52 --> 5299.56]  encouraged pennsylvania railroad and new york central railroad to merge um that i i don't i don't know
[5299.56 --> 5304.84]  if i'm convinced any of those things were better for consumers in any way so let's not root for this
[5304.84 --> 5311.80]  i guess would be all i have to say about that but um generally less competition is bad yeah there is
[5311.80 --> 5319.48]  immense endless proof of this yeah you don't want consolidation yeah cool
[5322.28 --> 5330.04]  nice speaking of uh highly consolidated uh companies and integrated companies amazon is
[5330.04 --> 5338.92]  apparently taking on shein and temu with a new sub-20 amazon haul it's a mobile it's mobile only okay that
[5338.92 --> 5345.08]  completely kills like my plan for this for wancho the only reason this is in the dock is because i
[5345.08 --> 5351.08]  was like luke and i should shop for lulz what am i looking at is that a phone on a dock that is
[5351.08 --> 5355.56]  capturable by the stream i think i think dan's away for a second but i that's set up for something else
[5355.56 --> 5360.68]  but i think we could oh cool okay well yeah anyway i'd wanted us to maybe that is set up for this i'd
[5360.68 --> 5364.68]  wanted us to shop well dan's not there luke he's not there who are you talking to you're like looking
[5364.68 --> 5369.88]  past the camera at dan you could he's literally not there you can see he's not there yeah he's
[5369.88 --> 5376.60]  he's there in our hearts though um anyway he'll come back he'll come back uh so it's a mobile only
[5376.60 --> 5382.04]  shopping experience can we just call it this mic is still on i just kicked it by accident oh no
[5382.04 --> 5386.76]  just because we can hear it doesn't mean oh okay okay uh hey dan what's this phone for
[5386.76 --> 5392.84]  oh that's for a segment which one oh it's for home it is for this oh sick what a guy
[5395.08 --> 5400.36]  no that's cool no no you're good okay so we're gonna we're gonna shop do you have to do anything
[5400.36 --> 5405.48]  to set it up what is this all right watch me oh there was there was some reason watch me hack into
[5405.48 --> 5416.28]  this phone dan explained and and hacked he's elite he's in the gibson elite hackser uh okay cool
[5416.76 --> 5422.44]  so does it have the does it have the shop on it yeah i'll do the thing oh i mean well i could i
[5422.44 --> 5426.04]  could have hacked it i could have hacked it yeah i can hack it yeah probably okay i'm gonna go to
[5426.04 --> 5434.36]  luke's laptop oh oh oh that's cool and now it's a mouse now it's a wait now it's a what now now
[5434.36 --> 5441.24]  it's a mouse it's a mouse because i couldn't find the iphone oh we're using dex okay yeah luke's laptop
[5442.04 --> 5445.80]  what's supposed to happen to luke's laptop oh brilliant it should be in google at the bottom genius
[5446.76 --> 5453.80]  okay so you mean chrome or oh oh i understand oh that's funky okay hey there we go we're on mobile
[5453.80 --> 5462.28]  but also not mobile okay so it's it's amazon halls uh amazon hall way to go dan uh okay as modern retail
[5462.28 --> 5469.24]  points out hall is already inundated with misleading ai images on product pages this program marks a
[5469.24 --> 5475.32]  strategic shift for amazon as it directly competes with platforms like sheen and temu in the cheap junk
[5475.32 --> 5481.08]  market amazon hall's focus on low-cost goods raises concerns about product quality sustainability and
[5481.08 --> 5487.80]  ethical sourcing yeah i mean if those weren't already concerns for you on amazon um i think a
[5487.80 --> 5491.40]  lot of people will say that they care about that and then they'll go to a website to buy something
[5491.40 --> 5494.92]  and be like that's expensive and then go to something like sheen or temu or something like
[5494.92 --> 5499.40]  that and be like oh wow i'm gonna buy that i suddenly don't care dude the number of people that
[5499.40 --> 5504.68]  virtue signal to me about all kinds of stuff and then immediately you're gonna be like
[5506.12 --> 5511.88]  four dollars for a little mini broom what a rip off i could get it for two it's like well yeah
[5511.88 --> 5518.60]  i'm like anyway uh luke laptop it's so important until it affects my wallet okay so what are we what
[5518.60 --> 5524.84]  are we looking what are we looking at here this is a little bit eye strain o vision not gonna lie um dan
[5524.84 --> 5532.12]  how much do you know about about decks is there uh i don't know i couldn't like figure it out in
[5532.12 --> 5537.40]  time unfortunately um okay well what's this let's let's look at some stuff this is mobile only which
[5537.40 --> 5542.68]  is why we're on decks really don't think it's a shoe luke and it's probably designed for phones not
[5542.68 --> 5550.76]  for a 16 by 9 monitor yeah i mean that makes sense what was it what was this product it said it says below
[5550.76 --> 5556.36]  the picture did i just add this to cart it says below the picture above the color selections above

[5618.60 --> 5624.04]  this is just badly photoshopped like that person is clearly not standing in that room oh you gotta
[5624.04 --> 5629.40]  expect it to be better if it was an ai image jordan said that you have to select one for a price you
[5629.40 --> 5633.72]  have to select one go back up i thought we did but didn't i select one are we on a product page

[5911.72 --> 5919.00]  account so i cannot log in was that taken away from you no a bad boy no i just don't have it because
[5919.00 --> 5924.44]  yvonne has it okay yeah well we both use the same account yeah and only one of us has
[5924.44 --> 5931.40]  our phone number on it so there you go i mean there's solutions to that yeah but i don't care
[5931.40 --> 5936.20]  yeah because like whatever fair enough fair enough who cares it's amazon account uh apparently you can
[5936.20 --> 5940.44]  use the whole app but yeah we're trying to show it to you guys so we want to use the site i could sign
[5940.44 --> 5949.24]  into it but like i don't really want to sign into my yeah i don't i don't blame you um so cool
[5949.24 --> 5957.08]  kuichi says you can borrow mine nice uh you know what i don't know if i care anymore yeah cool
[5958.12 --> 5964.12]  nice i think i'm over it um so amazon hauls everyone yay thanks dan
[5966.28 --> 5972.44]  um i thought when you had the whole rig it was an app okay no that's why i had to do the whole rig
[5972.44 --> 5977.24]  because it's just a bloody website but you could just request anyways whatever it's fine
[5979.40 --> 5983.64]  okay whatever i only learned i learned about this 20 minutes before the show started you know what i'm
[5983.64 --> 5987.80]  just going to show people how it works because it is actually like that's probably a really good idea
[5987.80 --> 5993.56]  okay do some learning for this traffic fire whoa i didn't mean to do that okay if you have 12
[5995.00 --> 6000.44]  and then click on this little oh i already did it so if you have 12 and then there's oh you gotta hide
[6000.44 --> 6003.88]  the merch message at the time there we go this little button right here that shows like a laptop
[6003.88 --> 6009.72]  and a phone if you click on that you can get different you know responsive design dimensions
[6009.72 --> 6015.40]  so now it thinks i'm on a phone right so you can view and experience websites potentially your own
[6015.40 --> 6019.56]  website if you're trying to do development in different formats different screen sizes stuff like
[6019.56 --> 6023.88]  that so you can you know you don't have to own every single version of every single crazy stupid
[6023.88 --> 6026.52]  android phone um also i just noticed this what is that
[6026.52 --> 6034.60]  i don't know that's cute that's awesome anyways that is actually like a cool fairly handy thing
[6034.60 --> 6038.20]  if you didn't know about that it's kind of neat all right uh speaking of things we didn't know about
[6038.20 --> 6045.08]  we have talked a couple of times about the sydney island deer cull on the wan show yeah and i received
[6045.08 --> 6051.64]  an email this long wow about our discussion apparently i was very wrong and misled um
[6051.64 --> 6061.72]  um okay and i did click this link and i spent probably about an hour uh poking about on it
[6062.36 --> 6075.16]  and it is less far less stupid um than we have been led to believe and led you to believe so i'm open to
[6075.16 --> 6083.64]  mind being changed i have a hard time believing that but i am i am open to facts so what uh what we
[6083.64 --> 6089.24]  talked about was there's this island that has an invasive species of deer and um we were laughing
[6089.24 --> 6096.20]  about how the canadian government has apparently hired uh international helicopter hunters to come
[6096.20 --> 6103.16]  and shoot them and we kind of talked about how hunters would have paid to hunt those deer and etc etc etc
[6103.16 --> 6110.44]  um and there are a lot of reasons that i wouldn't have considered for why that is not
[6111.48 --> 6119.80]  actually a real solution um so one of them is that it they have attempted that multiple times
[6120.44 --> 6125.96]  and the problems with the solution of just having hunters call them is that they don't get everything
[6126.44 --> 6132.20]  and whenever they don't get everything the population bounces back pops right back up not only that but when
[6132.20 --> 6140.44]  that population bounces back um it is every single time a more difficult population to call because
[6140.44 --> 6147.16]  what the like a virus what the population there has learned is that during hunting season or during
[6147.16 --> 6152.52]  hunting activities there are places on the island which is populated by humans there are places on the
[6152.52 --> 6159.00]  island that they can go where they cannot be hunted safely by recreational hunters and they will camp out
[6159.00 --> 6162.92]  there they will hide there they'll wait there they'll wait there and they'll just wait it out closer to
[6162.92 --> 6168.36]  people i'm assuming because you can't shoot closer to residential areas um so they'll hide there they'll
[6168.36 --> 6174.76]  hide in areas that are extremely extremely difficult to access on foot which is where the helicopters come in
[6174.76 --> 6184.76]  gotcha um and basically what i was what i was not aware of and what uh i have now
[6184.76 --> 6192.12]  had my mind opened to is that rage bait headlines like that rarely tell the complete story
[6193.48 --> 6198.76]  in response to your question before the show did it really need to be like a culling company from new
[6198.76 --> 6206.04]  zealand coming across the entire half of the freaking world to come do it well they did a bidding process
[6206.60 --> 6213.32]  and they won the bid it was that simple that decision so they were looking for someone who was qualified
[6213.32 --> 6219.96]  in this type of cull they put out a bid and that company won the bid so that's why i thought it
[6219.96 --> 6225.48]  okay and one of my problems here is i'm getting a lot of uh my information from like random sources
[6225.48 --> 6231.08]  that i've come across here or there yeah i thought it like didn't work very well and they only got like
[6231.08 --> 6236.12]  80 of them or something uh so i think it's uh don't quote me on this but i think it might have actually
[6236.12 --> 6240.60]  been paused for now like i don't know if i don't know if this actually was paused now but as far as my
[6240.60 --> 6246.04]  understanding goes that that is because of the fencing killing deer that they didn't want to it's
[6246.04 --> 6251.08]  like non-invasive or something i think it's completely unrelated so it is possible that this won't work
[6252.92 --> 6257.08]  but when we were laughing about this on the wan show and we were like here's all the other things
[6257.08 --> 6263.00]  that could have tried they have okay they have tried that's fair enough i still massively question
[6263.00 --> 6270.12]  the whole helicopter approach so apparently there are parts of this island that are extremely that part is
[6270.12 --> 6275.72]  interesting to me inhospitable to human traversal yeah you don't want to be like hanging off a cliff
[6275.72 --> 6281.96]  trying to shoot a deer but deer can access them yeah um so there's an entire there's an entire parks
[6281.96 --> 6292.28]  canada like micro site about this whole thing what's the issue what's been done what have we tried uh for
[6292.28 --> 6301.56]  literally 40 years uh we've tried hunting and culling and etc etc etc etc um eradication a globally proven
[6301.56 --> 6311.56]  conservation method why here's the timeline why are we doing this um here's a huge faq um that is a lot
[6311.56 --> 6318.44]  i spent a lot of time reading it um it may not work it may not be excellent use of funds it's not
[6318.44 --> 6326.52]  obviously stupid either uh see i think my biggest problem was the use of funds made it seem stupid
[6326.52 --> 6334.28]  sure uh like this this is the i think the specific article that i had found yeah so like i don't know
[6334.28 --> 6340.04]  and that's you know what that's fair enough maybe it didn't work and maybe it turned out to be stupid
[6340.04 --> 6344.84]  i don't know but it was not their first choice yeah
[6348.12 --> 6353.48]  i don't think i said it was their first choice no no we didn't but they're basically it's not just
[6353.48 --> 6362.12]  a completely irrational completely stupid thing either so all i'm saying is that the truth is often nuanced
[6362.12 --> 6371.48]  and rarely just yeah i do know that some of the prices that were thrown out were wrong because
[6372.52 --> 6378.92]  the that wasn't the car that wasn't the cost of like the helicopter shooting people that was the
[6378.92 --> 6385.96]  cost of the entire project which as it tends to go with government stuff included a lot of other things
[6385.96 --> 6392.44]  um not not just you know the helicopter crew it involved like a huge amount of steps of the process
[6393.08 --> 6398.52]  dealing with things in a trillion different ways um so the the like millions of dollars number i think
[6398.52 --> 6404.84]  is i don't know if i would necessarily say inflated but i think when people were describing the project
[6405.40 --> 6409.00]  they were only describing the helicopter part and then putting the dollar value on which i might have
[6409.00 --> 6414.68]  also done um so it makes it sound like that was just for the helicopter portion which i don't think
[6414.68 --> 6418.76]  is true i think there was like paying native tribes and doing a variety of other things wow
[6418.76 --> 6425.32]  apparently netflix video quality is like all over the place right now is is the main event happening now
[6425.88 --> 6429.96]  is that it's being streamed on netflix yeah i thought it was a netflix deal oh wow
[6430.52 --> 6436.20]  um has netflix ever had a fight before i don't know i mean netflix does all kinds of stuff so who knows
[6437.80 --> 6444.12]  um see people are saying not yet oh it's the women's fight now well i mean that is the only real fight
[6444.12 --> 6449.24]  that's all that's like an actual main event that's apparently like an important fight oh okay yeah
[6449.24 --> 6457.96]  the like like actual like legit fighters and you know stuff fight uh yeah quality is uh quality is
[6457.96 --> 6464.28]  apparently terrible yeah minus likes cat fights confirmed no no i don't i i'm not really uh i'm not
[6464.28 --> 6472.44]  really like a combat sports watcher um but i know that andrew is uh i really liked watching one of them is
[6472.44 --> 6479.80]  irish um and i also know that um you know apparently this is this has been the whole
[6480.92 --> 6487.00]  the whole circus show that is accompanying you know this this women's fight uh has been very helpful in
[6487.00 --> 6493.48]  promoting women's boxing so okay i think that's really cool um sure so that's where i'm at on that
[6494.84 --> 6501.88]  i liked watching gsp because it felt very technical um that kind of got me interested in jujitsu that was a
[6501.88 --> 6506.84]  big a big thing that led me into starting to actually train jujitsu was like seeing like oh
[6506.84 --> 6514.84]  this is this is like i don't know anyways doesn't really matter i've watched a sick like half hour um
[6515.40 --> 6524.92]  youtube documentary on this guy okay he is an incredible story um i again like i'm not into combat sports i
[6524.92 --> 6531.56]  don't really care uh but butterbean is like officially my hero oh it's butterbean okay yeah
[6531.56 --> 6536.76]  i didn't recognize him immediately yeah um so it's one of those things where like i can i can definitely
[6536.76 --> 6543.72]  appreciate certain characters or styles and i can definitely get behind like an underdog nobody story
[6543.72 --> 6551.40]  and stuff like that but it's not um i don't know it's not it's not like my thing i don't fall i don't
[6551.40 --> 6558.28]  follow it closely or anything like that wow mpoc nor 47 says netflix won't even load midwest us i
[6558.28 --> 6565.80]  mean that's the thing i think people don't i think people for the most part don't understand what a
[6565.80 --> 6573.24]  fine balancing act infrastructure is it's also streaming they do a lot of odd like how like how
[6573.24 --> 6582.52]  how how razor thin the margins are in this industry in some ways and how how hard fought the efficiencies
[6582.52 --> 6592.52]  you gain are and how um how dialed in and tuned your uh your architecture is for your your anticipated
[6592.52 --> 6600.92]  load for your typical use case like like like langley man said langley pc has 4k netflix so it's probably not
[6600.92 --> 6606.04]  a origin issue it's probably more of an edge issue yeah so it could be that where you are
[6606.68 --> 6613.00]  all of a sudden there's like a dispar a huge influx of netflix users for example taking it down
[6613.00 --> 6617.48]  possibly that's crazy that's genuinely pretty crazy that netflix is struggling under this that's
[6617.48 --> 6624.60]  that's pretty wild yeah but but also it surprises me and also doesn't because i mean yeah that's a
[6624.60 --> 6630.68]  thing you see like some big game will come out yep and like oh oh my god everyone like half of
[6630.68 --> 6635.64]  the eastern seaboard is like internet speed is slowed to a crawl like these things do happen not
[6635.64 --> 6643.00]  often anymore and and credit to the folks who who design and maintain these systems but it's a thing
[6643.00 --> 6652.44]  guys yeah and like like lou said live live is tough live sucks so much harder like yeah i i you know i i
[6652.44 --> 6659.00]  paid for sportsnet when uh during the playoffs last year and like yeah i i was freaking annoyed that the
[6659.00 --> 6665.00]  video quality was so crap it was kind of like and it wasn't the player suck too i remember like yeah
[6665.00 --> 6669.64]  i don't especially for like how much well one of the details was that you figured out how to pirate
[6669.64 --> 6676.92]  streams just exploiting their player so that's one thing um that sucks about it like we literally have
[6676.92 --> 6682.92]  better drm than roger sportsnet which is pretty embarrassing i learned so much about online video
[6682.92 --> 6688.84]  from doing that oh yeah yeah yeah i wanted to try to steal it for from my own platform
[6690.20 --> 6696.60]  and then you can just do that for everyone else's yeah you learn pretty funny um anyway like i remember
[6696.60 --> 6700.84]  being annoyed about it but on the flip side i mean for how much they're charging i should definitely
[6700.84 --> 6705.32]  have gotten better video quality but but on the flip side i do understand that streaming video is
[6705.32 --> 6712.36]  really freaking hard stuff um all right what are we supposed to be talking about right now
[6713.40 --> 6720.84]  um oh the eu fined meta nearly 800 million euro over facebook marketplace uh they're saying they
[6720.84 --> 6725.24]  violated eu antitrust rules by tying facebook marketplace to their social network facebook
[6725.24 --> 6731.32]  which gives marketplace an unfair advantage over rival classified ad services the ec also found that
[6731.32 --> 6736.60]  meta exploited data gathered from facebook users to benefit marketplace further solidifying
[6736.60 --> 6741.16]  marketplace's position and hampering competition this includes using personal data to display
[6741.16 --> 6746.52]  personalized ads on marketplace makes sense the ec asserts that meta's anti-competitive behavior limits
[6746.52 --> 6751.16]  choice and innovation in the online classifieds market that consumers face fewer options and potentially
[6751.16 --> 6759.00]  higher prices i i i will say before there was like a bunch of options and now everyone just uses
[6759.00 --> 6766.92]  facebook marketplace but what i will say is i use facebook marketplace because it is way better than
[6766.92 --> 6776.20]  everything that came before everything before was pretty much terrible text on a page and html sites the
[6776.20 --> 6784.36]  integration with facebook and tying it to a a real identity and a real user account where you can like rate
[6784.36 --> 6790.44]  someone's transaction and it like appears on their real like actual identity assuming that they are using
[6790.44 --> 6795.32]  a real account there's obviously fake accounts but i'd like to think i can tell the difference pretty easily
[6795.96 --> 6804.60]  that is a fundamental what i just you're talking about how they're kind of crappy sites and this stat has just
[6804.60 --> 6815.56]  always floored me they make that much 50 employees annual revenue 694 million they just rake it in and
[6815.56 --> 6822.28]  always have and then just you know what should we do with the website i don't know just make it i love
[6822.28 --> 6830.20]  craigslist a text site with html links it's what google should have stayed as it's so basic i love it
[6830.20 --> 6838.68]  you back off my craigslist craigslist is a stunning company and website that just people don't really
[6838.68 --> 6844.52]  think about and then they don't even have like sex work anymore yeah that was a thing wasn't it oh
[6845.88 --> 6852.52]  that was the only reason craigslist existed yeah as far as i could tell yeah it began in 1995
[6852.52 --> 6862.76]  so it's been running for 29 years revenue 660 million wow okay crazy absolutely crazy um
[6864.12 --> 6869.24]  just one of those companies that yeah it doesn't get talked about a lot and just rakes it in anyways
[6869.24 --> 6880.76]  sorry okay um cool so anywho um yeah so i i i i don't know on the one hand yeah they're they're right
[6880.76 --> 6887.48]  from an antitrust standpoint they're like 100 right um and and i wish that other jurisdictions
[6887.48 --> 6891.96]  enforced antitrust the way the eu has started cracking down on it it would absolutely be a good
[6891.96 --> 6897.40]  thing i don't have much hope for the next little while as far as that goes but hey lena khan we
[6897.40 --> 6904.60]  we're rooting for you over here please hold on yeah um i know there's nothing you can really do about
[6904.60 --> 6910.28]  it but please from my point of view at least for now until facebook abuses their position
[6910.92 --> 6915.72]  facebook marketplace has been a very good disruptor i love facebook marketplace i think
[6915.72 --> 6921.00]  there's things that they could do better what's the differentiating things that you like i like that
[6921.00 --> 6926.04]  it's tied to an actual profile that you maintain and care about that is a reflection of your personal
[6926.04 --> 6932.04]  image i think that improves accountability um compared to the number of times i've been ghosted on
[6932.04 --> 6938.12]  something like craigslist um i ever try to sniff out if an account is real or not i like that i like
[6938.12 --> 6943.64]  that messaging is integrated that's super convenient it's it's on an app that i already have on my phone
[6943.64 --> 6950.20]  and already use so another layer of convenience craigslist emails are a little annoying um and and the
[6950.20 --> 6956.36]  fact that so many people don't include any way to reliably contact them um like people don't like
[6956.36 --> 6960.76]  putting a phone number on craigslist for obvious reasons but if you don't have a phone number
[6960.76 --> 6967.24]  i mean the best you can hope for is maybe 24 hour return round trip times for communication it's not
[6967.24 --> 6973.16]  fast enough so i like the immediacy of arranging things i like that maps and locations are just
[6973.16 --> 6977.40]  integrated into the platform people people have to say where stuff is on craigslist but it's not
[6977.40 --> 6983.24]  validated in any way whereas facebook it's just it's like your location that you've selected at some
[6983.24 --> 6988.20]  point and it's just like part of the whole listing uh is is my understanding i'm actually not sure about
[6988.20 --> 6992.68]  that last one but everything else that i've said are things that i love about facebook marketplace
[6992.68 --> 6997.88]  marketplace instant messaging makes trolling people that post things for free or a dollar and actually
[6997.88 --> 7002.28]  want it for a lot more very fun i'd love to see facebook crack down on that i'd love the ability to
[7002.28 --> 7008.60]  report anyone who puts a price that isn't the actual price but that's probably the only area where i
[7008.60 --> 7013.72]  would like to see them innovate where it would be a meaningful change and then at that point it would be
[7013.72 --> 7022.68]  basically perfect for me i i wouldn't need anything else i know they're a sponsor but like they're not
[7022.68 --> 7027.96]  sponsoring this um i think they're pretty much just doing computers and stuff java but java seems pretty
[7027.96 --> 7032.92]  good yeah they only do computer hardware though and that's a little limiting not everything that i buy
[7032.92 --> 7037.64]  sell trade computer hardware is computer hardware but i had like for skype wars i had a genuinely good
[7037.64 --> 7043.32]  experience what's cool about java is because it's so focused on computer hardware you can have like
[7043.32 --> 7049.96]  filters and you can have you can have it's more like a shopping experience for used for used hardware
[7049.96 --> 7056.04]  yeah and there's absolutely a place for stuff like that but when it comes to just random stuff i need like
[7056.04 --> 7063.88]  scrap wood yeah yeah that's gonna be hyper local too yeah exactly facebook marketplace is the solution
[7063.88 --> 7071.24]  yeah for that yeah valve no i know the valve one i talk about that on on wench all the time valve's
[7071.24 --> 7076.84]  like the most profitable tech company there is per employee um by east one says close that stuff's
[7076.84 --> 7081.88]  annoying on sites like zillow too no i don't want to see a listing for a brand new home for zero dollars
[7083.00 --> 7089.32]  is so archaic it just sucks as far as i can tell terrible as far as i can tell the powers that be
[7089.32 --> 7095.08]  um no interest like it that way yep they absolutely i am like it that way because
[7095.72 --> 7099.88]  they want their commission and they want to be as necessary as possible for as long as possible
[7099.88 --> 7107.16]  yeah and i'm not like this is not like just some conspiracy theorist stuff like or anything like that
[7107.16 --> 7116.44]  this is just looking at the money following the money seeing where it goes and why and going oh okay
[7116.44 --> 7125.24]  it is in literally not no one who's in a position of power has any motivation whatsoever to make this
[7125.24 --> 7129.80]  better to make this a smoother easier experience because all that would do is make it so that they
[7129.80 --> 7136.12]  circumvent you yes that's it so why do that yep because a lot of these sites like they they do even
[7136.12 --> 7142.12]  have ways to circumvent having a purchasing realtor because there's ways to directly connect to the
[7142.12 --> 7151.80]  selling realtor um but you know yeah yeah no anyways i didn't want to talk about skeezy realtors i'll be
[7151.80 --> 7159.96]  right back uh sure uh i drank too much water i'll talk about an amazing topic while you're gone uh pizza
[7159.96 --> 7169.16]  huts pizza warmer warms pizza with ps5 exhaust i can go to another one
[7169.16 --> 7179.64]  uh yeah the pizza warmer is a 3d printable device oh so it's just a box that channels air okay i mean
[7179.64 --> 7183.72]  that makes sense it's a 3d printable device i don't know if you want to put your food on 3d printed
[7184.60 --> 7191.72]  uh 3d prints are food safe exactly one time because the small pores trap bacteria and you cannot clean
[7191.72 --> 7195.40]  them can you just put a plate in this thing maybe that would probably do you want to heat up
[7195.40 --> 7201.64]  a thing that goes around food that is 3d printed that should be i mean we're already full of
[7201.64 --> 7208.60]  microplastics anyway shove more in there yeah why not let's go or be able to extrude more out to make
[7208.60 --> 7215.64]  more pizza boxes i don't know uh generally uh uh who knows i want to see the microplastics
[7216.68 --> 7222.04]  i want macroplastics in my system check i'm not a not a doctor of pizza science anyways uh
[7222.04 --> 7229.48]  while it's designed to keep pizza warm uh yeah macro plastics yeah thanks using the ps5's exhaust
[7229.48 --> 7235.40]  heat there are concerns about its ability to heat evenly additionally placing that's the main concern
[7235.40 --> 7240.52]  plastic device near a heat source raises safety concerns and obstructing the console's airflow could
[7240.52 --> 7247.32]  cause overheating the the ps5 heating box does not heat very easily 8 out of 10 on tech radar i was
[7247.32 --> 7254.36]  messaged this internally by a writer a writer who is highly capable in my opinion of making
[7255.16 --> 7264.52]  a sick version of pizza heater version 2 and i i i i'm sure i came across sarcastic and i was mostly but
[7264.52 --> 7271.56]  i look like exclusive i hope that they take up the banner i've always wanted to like we could do a
[7271.56 --> 7277.56]  collab ironically go back and make one that's actually way over built and super sick most of
[7277.56 --> 7282.52]  the people here could have that done in like 20 there's so maybe now that could do that 30 minutes
[7282.52 --> 7289.24]  i don't even mean 3d printing though like make it sick yeah no i mean like do the design oh for a sick
[7289.24 --> 7295.80]  one yeah yeah we have so many and we have every single tool now yeah so like i think it would be
[7295.80 --> 7300.84]  wicked if we were just like copper you know what we're gonna go back to this project that was genuinely
[7300.84 --> 7306.68]  terrible and make it really good i mean like there was the there was the car they did a car
[7307.32 --> 7311.00]  i thought i mean that might have been so many things i don't know it's such a weird marketing as
[7311.00 --> 7316.12]  far as i can tell if you like whisper project ideas near sebastian things just happen um he's
[7316.12 --> 7321.80]  already texted me a couple times it's like oh it's got an aluminum trays you're not like eating the pizza
[7321.80 --> 7330.20]  off of the uh the plastic i didn't realize it sits on top when when i read this topic originally i was
[7330.20 --> 7334.60]  imagining that it's on top yeah i was imagining that it was like a tube that kind of came out
[7334.60 --> 7340.68]  of the back of the playstation and then like wrapped around into a box but no it seems to sit on top
[7340.68 --> 7345.72]  maybe we should click on the link and show people hold on i know how to host a show sometimes wow the
[7345.72 --> 7350.44]  bare minimum when it does sit on top what are you talking about no no no that's what it actually does
[7350.44 --> 7356.36]  i thought it was like a tube out the back but i don't know on the side of the ps5 the ps5 has a
[7356.36 --> 7362.12]  giant fan hole in the side of it yeah okay dbrand made some plates to expose because they patented
[7362.12 --> 7367.56]  that i expected yeah so it goes all the way around it oh that's fine yeah it doesn't look like it
[7367.56 --> 7374.84]  hates very easily a garbage product pulling inspiration from pizza hut's red roof the lid seamlessly opens like
[7374.84 --> 7383.64]  a laptop for easy pizza access those things don't line up what what pizza hut what pizza hut roofs
[7383.64 --> 7392.52]  easily seamlessly open i also keep my pizza in laptops designed to snugly affix to the top of your
[7392.52 --> 7399.24]  gaming console they don't say ps4 or ps5 with a tray that fits several slices it won't go anywhere and you
[7399.24 --> 7408.76]  won't have to either oh god channeling worth from the gaming console's warm air pipe straight to your
[7408.76 --> 7415.32]  pizza slices science and engineering for the greater good great maybe this timeline is okay i like this
[7415.32 --> 7420.84]  a lot this is an all right part of it this is this makes everything okay i feel much more like secure as
[7420.84 --> 7427.08]  a person now can you approve a project for us doing i don't have to be involved at all i feel so validated
[7427.08 --> 7435.24]  by the uh ps5 warming thing by the way not a stupid idea just bad execution well this one's not called heater i
[7435.24 --> 7435.64]  never
[7439.32 --> 7445.88]  i never pitched a heater okay what do you want i i think people at the company should actually make
[7445.88 --> 7452.92]  one that's like sick we should do it we have we have abundance of talent in that realm at this point
[7452.92 --> 7458.04]  we could absolutely do it a lot of design time i absolutely think we should do it we should do it
[7458.04 --> 7463.48]  it'd be sick i'd be so down yeah we'd have to figure out whatever the most like efficient way
[7463.48 --> 7469.24]  of capturing the heat is totally it should be like overly scientifically cft analysis we would do flow
[7469.24 --> 7475.96]  calculations we could play around with the fan curves in the system to make sure that like our our
[7475.96 --> 7482.04]  target temperature is like as hot as possible so basically we'd we'd basically run we'd run it at
[7482.04 --> 7487.48]  idle or we'd run it fanless when it's at idle so that we could keep so we could keep the actual
[7487.48 --> 7495.24]  temperature of the cpu as high as possible yeah dude i would be i would be super down i think it's sick
[7497.00 --> 7502.68]  i think it's sick you could probably even like work with pizza hut like imagine getting pizza hut to
[7502.68 --> 7507.48]  sponsor it you just make like the the pc version yeah you're into reaching out to brands and things
[7507.48 --> 7514.20]  now i'd be kind of sick actually like unironically be kind of sick to work with pizza hut on this do
[7514.20 --> 7521.16]  it i don't know i certainly wouldn't work with pizza hut um why you don't like their pizza do you i
[7521.16 --> 7527.48]  don't know when the last time i had it i have no idea yeah i just think they have a funny red hat
[7527.48 --> 7537.24]  that opens like a laptop yeah pizza hut is like not good pizza okay i mean i guess it doesn't really
[7537.24 --> 7541.96]  matter is there a certain point a pizza chain that would have you know money to do sponsorship that
[7541.96 --> 7548.44]  does good pizza i like panago is panago canadian only though i think so i'm pretty sure pretty sure
[7548.44 --> 7554.60]  it's canadian company oh okay well let's see at least it was when i worked there
[7554.60 --> 7563.00]  what what just what just happened i tried to tried to load this site and it just what just happened
[7563.56 --> 7569.40]  okay i'm trying to go to okay contact us okay man remember when companies used to have an about us and
[7569.40 --> 7576.36]  it like said where they were based and stuff yo they're from abbotsford no way what the first three
[7576.36 --> 7582.28]  stores for panago pizza opened in abbotsford in 1986. abbotsford british columbia and operated under the
[7582.28 --> 7590.04]  brand panagopolis two for one pizza place i remember when it was called panagopolis well
[7590.04 --> 7594.28]  apparently the the actual name was panagopolis two for one pizza place and then it changed to
[7594.28 --> 7599.16]  panagopolis pizza place huh and then it later changed to panagopolis so you probably saw it then
[7599.16 --> 7603.40]  yeah and then it shortened to panago that's crazy i didn't know about any of the previous names before
[7603.40 --> 7608.84]  pan i had no idea they were just a local company crazy the headquarters is down the road from seven oaks
[7608.84 --> 7613.32]  mall okay well there you go so probably not panago then i mean i don't think they are now i think
[7613.32 --> 7618.76]  they're like nationwide now but yeah i don't think they're outside of canada all right then they've
[7618.76 --> 7624.28]  always been pretty solid i don't know maybe it doesn't matter i don't think that pizza has to be
[7624.28 --> 7630.04]  something that i like personally endorse it's just literally a a warm object to keep warm so maybe i
[7630.04 --> 7634.28]  maybe i don't care that much okay so business team if you're watching this i'm open to working with
[7634.28 --> 7638.28]  whoever as far as the pizza goes and it's not like i have to say you're not saying they're
[7638.28 --> 7643.40]  looking good or whatever is good yeah yeah i think it's okay you're saying their pizza is being kept
[7643.40 --> 7649.48]  warm like it doesn't collaborate with pizza pizza uh their pizza can serve as both a construction
[7649.48 --> 7655.56]  material and content yeah okay pizza also canadian i've never had pizza pizza uh it used to be called
[7655.56 --> 7663.40]  little caesars oh what right really no i think it's a sub separate separate brand i think i thought
[7663.40 --> 7671.08]  that well that was their slogan little caesars pizza that was like their thing pizza pizza wasn't it
[7671.08 --> 7676.92]  little caesars was american though i know but we had it here but pizza pizza is a canadian brand oh it is
[7676.92 --> 7683.24]  yeah oh never mind i know this apparently it's not the same thing pizza pizza is east coast wait it's
[7683.24 --> 7688.36]  separate they're different okay i don't know little caesars used to have pizza pizza as their like
[7688.36 --> 7693.08]  jingle you know i only know that pizza pizza is a canadian brand because of because of baby no money
[7694.12 --> 7697.88]  i was trying to figure out like how do i know this even though i've never been there and then that's
[7697.88 --> 7705.16]  why brilliant yeah uh all right cool yeah pizza pizza was just a slogan okay well shows you what i know
[7705.16 --> 7712.60]  um speaking of things that i know i gave bad advice for washing the backpack um in 2022 someone asked on
[7712.60 --> 7720.20]  the forum if the ltt backpack was washer safe and uh linus replied in the thread saying it's probably
[7720.20 --> 7723.88]  fine anything with lots of little hanging pieces should be placed in a mesh bag before putting in
[7723.88 --> 7727.32]  the washing machine this is much for the safety of your washing machine as the garment i don't think
[7727.32 --> 7731.56]  we officially advertise our bag as washing machine safe but i'd be blown away if anything bad happened
[7731.56 --> 7737.56]  if you run it on cold do not put it in the dryer turns out hey not sure if nick has already
[7737.56 --> 7742.28]  messaged you about this but can we please delete this comment from linus asap context customer followed
[7742.28 --> 7749.32]  this recommendation to disastrous results um you just scroll down and there's the photo
[7751.96 --> 7756.12]  turns out it wasn't fine it's weird to me that it it only really seems to have happened in that
[7756.12 --> 7760.44]  one spot like the rest of it looks i don't know how i don't know how that would have happened yeah me
[7760.44 --> 7766.44]  neither but um anyway we only recommend spot cleaning machine washing is not recommended the bulkiness of
[7766.44 --> 7770.44]  the backpack is likely to lead to it being damaged in the spin cycle or something like that
[7771.00 --> 7775.64]  um so you can mix water with a small amount of laundry detergent use that to dampen a watch cloth
[7775.64 --> 7781.88]  and wipe clean then allow it to air dry by placing it upside down in a well ventilated space um i am
[7781.88 --> 7787.40]  blown away that something bad happened to it but um and like that we did replace the backpack so that's
[7787.40 --> 7793.00]  specific of an area and like trust me bro i will give you good advice or i will replace your backpack yeah
[7793.00 --> 7801.00]  whoops pretty funny i wonder if what happened to that is the same thing that happened to one of my
[7801.00 --> 7807.40]  shoes where you know how you know how washers have those like the arm things panels to help mix up the
[7807.40 --> 7813.80]  clothing um one of my shoes got stuck in between the sidewall and one of the the whatever you want
[7813.80 --> 7818.04]  to call them so like maybe the bag got like stuck in there or something i have no idea because that is
[7818.04 --> 7821.56]  weird and very oddly specific i'm not sure how that happened
[7824.04 --> 7828.20]  but anyways anyway trust me bro guarantee to the rescue
[7830.20 --> 7836.52]  apex legends overwatch and fortnite all launch classic modes as gamers play the same games over
[7836.52 --> 7842.60]  and over and over and over a recent study found that while the console and pc games market grew by 2.6
[7842.60 --> 7851.64]  in 2023 90 of new game revenue belonged to just 43 titles most of which were live service games so if
[7851.64 --> 7859.48]  you were wondering why live service games are everywhere like a cancer that's why this is why
[7859.48 --> 7867.72]  it's gamers fault five games accounted for 27 of all playtime it's only gamers fault fortnite roblox
[7867.72 --> 7876.44]  league of legends minecraft and gta 5. 50 of time spent playing new games a maximum of two years old
[7876.44 --> 7884.12]  was on sequels like ea sports fc uh fifa they lost licensing deal haha uh nick ploof apparently worked
[7884.12 --> 7892.76]  on this one nba 2k and call of duty apex overwatch and fortnite all came out over five years ago and are
[7892.76 --> 7899.08]  still going strong apex sees about 18 million active players monthly overwatch 2 sees about 6.4 million
[7899.08 --> 7905.48]  daily not on steam apparently everyone hates it there uh fortnite sees about 3 million daily i have
[7905.48 --> 7911.24]  a really hard time believing overwatch 2 is bigger than fortnite by over double yeah i have a really hard
[7911.24 --> 7921.16]  time these all have citations uh fortnite.gg um that's a 24-hour peak like just in the last 24 hours so
[7921.16 --> 7926.36]  i'm sure they've had uh yeah they've they've definitely had bigger peaks um the point is just
[7926.36 --> 7931.80]  millions of players playing these old games remasters and remakes also incredibly popular warcraft 3
[7931.80 --> 7936.76]  reforged was recently updated actually i'm really excited about this one uh warcraft 3 reforged got a
[7936.76 --> 7941.08]  2.0 uh you can toggle between the old and new graphics and it apparently like tries to fix a bunch
[7941.08 --> 7946.92]  of the issues and this was released alongside remastered warcraft 1 and warcraft 2. i kind of want to buy
[7946.92 --> 7951.80]  it it's like 40 bucks i don't know if i really want to give uh blazer activision money but i really
[7951.80 --> 7959.56]  want it i tried to dig out my old warcraft 3 disc and i like i still have my key but i lost my disc
[7960.68 --> 7966.36]  and i but i have it in i have it in a like a file type that no i no longer have any way to like mount
[7966.36 --> 7971.56]  to anything and i'm just like i don't know i'm trying to just buy it demon tools demon tools anyway
[7971.56 --> 7976.20]  diablo 2 resurrected gta trilogy was recently updated to fix a lot of issues multiple years
[7976.20 --> 7981.80]  later horizon zero dawn remastered why nick ploof uh resident evil one two three that one is weird
[7981.80 --> 7986.52]  it's final fantasy 7 remake uh don't forget about the pixel remasters of the earlier final fantasy
[7986.52 --> 7992.52]  games that luke is never going to get around to playing anyway the point is it's it's a very it's
[7992.52 --> 8002.36]  a very long list recent video uh video game remakes and remasters um what is basically our discussion
[8002.36 --> 8006.60]  question is there are plenty of games that needed a remaster horizon zero dawn was not one of them
[8006.60 --> 8009.56]  what is the deal with this gamers suck
[8012.60 --> 8019.16]  okay another reason new triple a games are expensive while free-to-play games are free a lot of these
[8019.16 --> 8025.48]  games are free to play not all of them are but it's free to play a game you already bought like
[8025.48 --> 8033.08]  a minecraft for example my issue isn't at all with the play time my issue i think is with the revenue
[8033.08 --> 8039.16]  being so concentrated on live service 90 of new game revenue were 43 titles most of which were live
[8039.16 --> 8043.40]  service games that's the that's the part that stands out if you're still playing a live service
[8043.40 --> 8048.20]  game five years later are you really playing the same game though i mean the fact that they had to
[8048.20 --> 8053.80]  release classic modes at all sort of suggests that or acknowledges i kind of do agree with that that
[8053.80 --> 8058.60]  the game has changed enough and that's their whole model right is to keep yeah keep taking that money
[8058.60 --> 8063.40]  that they're making and putting it into new content that keeps people engaged now that can obviously
[8064.28 --> 8071.96]  manifest in sort of uh really negative manipulative ways um but on paper the idea is not that crazy it's
[8071.96 --> 8080.28]  almost like episodic gaming but more money and more effective i guess yeah and to be clear like you
[8080.28 --> 8087.40]  know if you if you play some free game a ton spending an amount of money on that game that you think is
[8090.44 --> 8095.96]  comparatively worth the time that you spent on it in order to reward the dev i don't think is necessarily
[8095.96 --> 8102.20]  bad but i also know people personally that like back in 2015 had spent over two grand on league of
[8102.20 --> 8108.20]  legends it's just like bro avon fox relax makes a really good point here intellectual lock-in once
[8108.20 --> 8112.44]  you've put that much time into getting good leaving the game feels like i think that's like waste of
[8112.44 --> 8116.84]  time and it's not fun to suck i think that's part of it and i think i think it's not fun to suck
[8116.84 --> 8129.72]  and people are so sweaty these days like wow like genuinely spending your evening just sitting in an
[8129.72 --> 8134.92]  aim trainer all night is not a thing that anyone would have done when we were growing up and if you
[8134.92 --> 8141.00]  did people would have shamed you like there were custom maps and stuff for things like counter-strike
[8141.00 --> 8146.68]  or whatever sure but that was abnormal that was something that like people who want to go pro do
[8146.68 --> 8151.00]  or something that was not something that average gamers would do most the custom maps for counter
[8151.00 --> 8157.24]  strike were like warcraft 3 mod so you'd get like lightning bolts that go along with your m4 shots
[8157.24 --> 8160.60]  and stuff like it was i i don't know there's a totally different no i mean there were like aim
[8160.60 --> 8169.64]  oriented i know i'm just saying like now a lot of them are like that back then they were weird little fun
[8169.64 --> 8176.60]  games like that's not i don't know man that's not fun to me that's like another job yeah i tried it
[8176.60 --> 8185.00]  once and was like i'll just be worse i guess okay crazy crazy side side tangent or not tangent but
[8185.00 --> 8192.36]  a bit of a reach here sure are we attaching more importance to our accomplishment in our hobbies
[8192.36 --> 8196.04]  because we're feeling less fulfilled by our work
[8196.04 --> 8206.60]  are we looking for fulfillment somewhere likely that it's frustrating i can't probably couldn't prove
[8206.60 --> 8212.20]  this i think that's right though i mean there's been there's been so much commentary about how
[8212.20 --> 8216.84]  there's no real progression you can't not only is there no real progression in your work you're not
[8216.84 --> 8221.48]  going to be able to progress in financially in your personal life you can't afford to buy a home
[8222.20 --> 8226.36]  for example you can't afford to buy or really own anything so is this like people who dress up
[8226.36 --> 8230.92]  their dogs and stuff because they can't afford kids it's something to be able to measure it's
[8230.92 --> 8238.52]  something to be able to grow and be good at achieve it's an achievement yeah um maybe definitely
[8238.52 --> 8242.92]  maybe i know like there's this there's the whole male pattern anxiety thing i don't know enough about
[8242.92 --> 8247.08]  this i might say something wrong go figure it out yourself yeah go watch a different podcast if you
[8247.08 --> 8252.28]  want to hear knowledgeable people yeah yeah the land show is the land show it's always going to be
[8252.28 --> 8261.08]  the land we talk about ramming um but that we know about um the whole male pattern anxiety thing is
[8261.08 --> 8269.40]  that uh and again please go look this up don't take me at my word but um uh average male anxiety and
[8269.40 --> 8273.80]  average female anxiety are different things obviously there's there's crossover whatever blah blah blah
[8273.80 --> 8283.16]  um but a lot of men tend to get anxiety spikes because of not being able to enact positive change
[8284.60 --> 8290.20]  um if they feel like they can't improve their their environment if they can't improve their work if
[8290.20 --> 8298.20]  they if they don't have agency to to try to drive things forward rob dog here says what am i actually
[8298.20 --> 8303.64]  even achieving in my 40-hour work week my hobbies i do much better yeah and that's a huge problem for a
[8303.64 --> 8309.16]  lot of people they they have i don't know what they're called like ghost jobs or whatever um that's
[8309.16 --> 8317.08]  like a very real thing i don't know it sounds pretty likely it sounds pretty likely to me especially with
[8317.08 --> 8322.84]  how seriously people approach it because that's the biggest change that i've noticed yeah it's like you
[8322.84 --> 8328.04]  could try to be good but you were playing a game now it's you're trying to be good and it's like
[8328.68 --> 8334.92]  life or death like i was lucky you know i um i happened it's not like i planned to work at a
[8334.92 --> 8340.60]  company where progression was possible like i got a little lucky i worked hard i earned my promotions
[8340.60 --> 8347.56]  obviously but what i was lucky in being able to do was having the opportunity to earn a promotion
[8347.56 --> 8352.20]  that's not always possible yeah whether you have an obstructionist boss or whether you just have a
[8352.20 --> 8358.76]  corporate structure or a union structure that does that rewards time you know rather than just be
[8358.76 --> 8363.56]  nowhere up to go yeah yeah or you're or you're in a company so you you can be in a company that's
[8363.56 --> 8369.24]  either too big or too small to properly recognize you know the exceptional work you're doing there can be a
[8369.80 --> 8375.08]  thousand reasons why career progression is not is not a thing um
[8375.08 --> 8385.48]  um but um and so i i i don't i don't relate to this but i can understand it if that makes sense like
[8385.48 --> 8393.72]  what would i have spent my energy on if every day i clocked in did the same damn thing and clocked out
[8396.28 --> 8400.44]  i'd want to achieve something i'd want to feel like i had power over something
[8400.44 --> 8408.76]  but like for me my job is what gives me fulfillment but i also have the privilege
[8408.76 --> 8417.72]  of having a job that can give me fulfillment and i do i think that is a notable not necessarily very
[8417.72 --> 8422.92]  common privilege at this point no i i i see that and i do think that there's a push and a pull
[8422.92 --> 8427.24]  i do think for sure part of it is a structural problem and i do think that part of it is an attitude
[8427.24 --> 8431.48]  problem i think that there are there it's a spectrum there's going to be cases where it's
[8431.48 --> 8437.32]  a hundred percent on the structure of this organization um i i know people in my personal
[8437.32 --> 8443.48]  life that i've talked to about their work life and they'll complain about how they they can't progress
[8443.48 --> 8449.16]  and then they'll also talk to me about the stuff that they do at work and i'm like and there are
[8449.16 --> 8454.84]  situations where it's a hundred percent because you're phoning it in but i think as is almost always
[8454.84 --> 8463.16]  the case the truth probably lies somewhere in between yeah for most people um but yeah it's just
[8465.72 --> 8471.40]  it's it's made gaming kind of not fun for me to be honest with you because i don't have time to be
[8471.40 --> 8477.72]  sweaty and i don't have the wherewithal to be sweaty it's also i mean we've talked about this extensively
[8477.72 --> 8482.68]  on wancho but the cheating problem is crazy now shroud was fairly recently quoted saying that he thinks
[8482.68 --> 8488.68]  in random pickup games on counter strikes in encounter strike um the the chance that you have
[8488.68 --> 8493.80]  a cheater in your lobby is essentially 100 percent really we know that effectively to be true with
[8493.80 --> 8499.24]  tarkov yeah like if you're playing a shooter game you're gonna have cheaters all over the place um
[8499.24 --> 8504.68]  it's like cheater be cheated essentially at that point then like it gets pretty brutal that's like
[8504.68 --> 8509.72]  that's a completely sad state of affairs i used to love playing uh online shooters and like you you
[8509.72 --> 8513.40]  always knew that was a problem that had been a problem since when we were kids but it was
[8515.72 --> 8522.44]  i don't think i was just naive to it i think it was way more blatant you were either very obviously
[8522.44 --> 8527.64]  cheating or you weren't and now it's like a lot of the cheats are a lot more subtle it's like okay
[8528.44 --> 8534.76]  you better situational awareness yeah you can't you can't catch that on a kill cam and people are like
[8534.76 --> 8541.16]  kind of trained on trying to hide it now um like it's it's and and the barrier of entry doesn't exist
[8541.16 --> 8546.28]  yeah i don't even remember the last time a major streamer got caught cheating oh there's which given
[8546.28 --> 8550.36]  how many of them got caught cheating in the old days or maybe it just doesn't make headlines anymore
[8550.36 --> 8556.60]  yeah okay seriously there's there's a youtuber that has a a series that has very many episodes in it
[8556.60 --> 8559.24]  that is just streamers getting caught cheating um
[8563.40 --> 8572.28]  yeah sad it's rough well i think it's time for darn clara dude how is it that dan leaves for like 30
[8572.28 --> 8579.88]  seconds every time we actually need him today yeah um okay well why don't we kill time while we wait for
[8579.88 --> 8585.08]  when after dark people are talking about netflix being like is there any other topic bad we need to
[8585.08 --> 8592.44]  go over no i don't think so the onion one nah i'm over it um i just thought it was funny yeah and but
[8592.44 --> 8598.12]  it's a it's apparently sort of unresolved now so got it we'll let that kind of sort itself out yeah
[8603.08 --> 8610.04]  how are you guys doing how are you doing i'm all right ankles how long do you think it'll be
[8610.04 --> 8621.72]  uh i sprained my ankle at this doofus's party um i blame you i blame you fair enough um basically
[8621.72 --> 8627.24]  what happened was i used to play paintball all the time and i just a bit of an itch for me yeah it was
[8627.24 --> 8635.56]  fun i well it was complicated i made i made a concerted effort to have fun it had it had i
[8635.56 --> 8643.96]  i go ahead public paintball fields i've i've always had a problem this one had more than i've
[8643.96 --> 8650.60]  had before uh in one game i not even speaking for linus who had a worse experience than i did i had to
[8650.60 --> 8657.32]  replace my my uh you call them markers i had to replace my my gun my marker um three separate times
[8657.32 --> 8664.44]  in one game that's a little bit of a lot yeah especially for how long um i was waiting for i
[8664.44 --> 8670.60]  i had to replace my marker five times across two two matches and i didn't even and i could have
[8670.60 --> 8675.64]  replaced it more times for the issues that i was having just like sputtering oh yeah i mean i had
[8675.64 --> 8680.36]  that constantly i didn't have a single gun that actually worked properly but you know the worst that
[8680.36 --> 8684.20]  i would usually have was like every third trigger pull it would actually shoot and then it's like okay
[8684.20 --> 8688.52]  i'll just shoot more in the first round the like there are the second round of the speedball map
[8688.52 --> 8693.40]  yes um i like coordinated with my team i was like okay you and me are gonna go this way hard we're
[8693.40 --> 8697.56]  gonna like draw their fire and we're basically just gonna like lay down cover i saw you guys are gonna
[8697.56 --> 8703.80]  go this way my marker didn't fire one ball if this might this might pat you on the back too much but
[8703.80 --> 8710.60]  i saw that movement happen and i knew it was you because like we've played a lot of yeah we've played
[8710.60 --> 8715.08]  paintball together before but we've also played a lot of video games so i know the type of like
[8715.08 --> 8719.88]  strategizing that linus will do and i saw like one person hang back at a barrel which i guess was you
[8719.88 --> 8724.44]  and i saw i think three or four different people like launch up one side all at the exact same side
[8724.44 --> 8729.88]  i'm like that's not normal human movement that was a plan i'm pretty sure i know who did that so the
[8729.88 --> 8738.20]  problem is that because i was shooting blanks you know in more ways than one oh yeah there was no reason
[8738.20 --> 8744.36]  for anybody to duck because there was no actual paint landing anywhere near them so they just lit
[8744.36 --> 8749.88]  me up we did start noticing on other maps that even if your gun the fact that when you get to this
[8749.88 --> 8755.72]  level strategizing you know it's kind of bad but uh we noticed that even uh even if your gun stopped
[8755.72 --> 8761.08]  functioning it would still make the noise and you'd get the like puff of like kind of smoky so people
[8761.08 --> 8768.84]  would fake yeah people people would fake and it didn't work when i was on that first map
[8768.84 --> 8773.88]  people figured out that i wasn't firing anything i like on the first map it was i would have lit up
[8773.88 --> 8778.92]  like between four and six people i think i i was they they were wide open because everyone was looking
[8778.92 --> 8783.88]  at my guys that were running it was just stacked oil barrels so on the first map people were ducking
[8783.88 --> 8790.12]  away more from the sound of the paintballs hitting the the empty drums on the future maps that wasn't a
[8790.12 --> 8794.76]  thing yes so it was more effective later on yeah but but i would have been able to keep everyone's
[8794.76 --> 8800.36]  head down and i would have been able to hit like half a dozen people but because i wasn't firing a
[8800.36 --> 8807.32]  single shot instead everyone's like uh and so all these like pubs at the field are like
[8809.40 --> 8815.96]  pretty bad and i got up dude i got i got obliterated i got team killed on that map because i was i was so
[8815.96 --> 8823.64]  far up on one of the sides trying to get far enough up that i could like uh shoot you guys broadside
[8823.64 --> 8828.84]  basically um and i was i was on the side of the barrels because that was actually more defense than
[8828.84 --> 8833.32]  being behind them now so i was on the side of the barrel and i i saw one of you but i had to get back
[8833.32 --> 8839.16]  around to get an angle so i come back around and my chest is facing back at us and just square right in
[8839.16 --> 8845.56]  the middle nice and i was like what they were literally at the first barrel next to the spawn
[8845.56 --> 8853.08]  never moved ever i had one opportunity to shoot someone the whole game and it was me nice okay um so
[8853.08 --> 8857.64]  anyway back to the story i used to play all the time and i would just play in whatever like ratty
[8857.64 --> 8863.56]  shoes i didn't care about destroying so i never had any traction specifically the organizer of this
[8863.56 --> 8869.48]  party uh bless her by the way um put in the thing hey make sure you wear hiking boots do this do that
[8869.48 --> 8874.20]  and i was like oh yeah i always like i never take my hiking boots for paintball uh yeah that obviously
[8874.20 --> 8880.04]  makes sense i should just put on my hiking boots um so i brought them anyway on the second map i was
[8880.04 --> 8884.04]  like trying to do a push i was trying to grab a couple of the noobs that had barely fired a shot
[8884.04 --> 8888.60]  because they just hung around at the spawn and i'll talk about why that is especially stupid at this
[8888.60 --> 8893.32]  place and a little bit but they just hung around at the spawn and i was like okay come on let's go let's
[8893.32 --> 8897.00]  push okay you guys are with me let's go let's go let's go let's go and so i was like trying to get
[8897.00 --> 8901.72]  up ahead of them so that i could kind of cover them to get into a position that would be moderately
[8901.72 --> 8909.56]  useful and i went sliding into cover except i was wearing hiking boots instead of just garbage shoes
[8910.76 --> 8920.92]  sudden traction yeah so man i immediately knew that i was very hurt um so that's that's why dbrand has
[8920.92 --> 8927.72]  all those videos of me hobbling around their facility with a cane because i at that point
[8927.72 --> 8933.24]  thought it was probably a grade two sprain i think now it's just a really bad grade one
[8933.80 --> 8942.12]  um i was on the badminton court last night so this is about a week later and i would describe my strength
[8942.12 --> 8947.88]  as about 30 percent and my range of motion is a hundred percent with only a little bit of pain
[8947.88 --> 8953.16]  but if i try to actually put any load on it it's probably like a four out of ten like it's it's
[8953.16 --> 8958.12]  still pretty painful i have a tournament coming up so i'm super especially not stoked because i was
[8958.12 --> 8964.52]  wanting to be like training a few times a week and like get getting some last minute you know feeling
[8964.52 --> 8973.80]  um and now i'm just upset pretty much anyway let's talk about why this field is trash and um i'll be naming
[8973.80 --> 8980.36]  names because i'm actually super mad yeah why not let's do it um boom get roasted some some of the
[8980.36 --> 8990.44]  ways in which delta force paintball in maple ridge is trash uh are sub are subjective so um it's here
[8990.44 --> 8996.60]  hold on let's let's get let's get the right location here um delta force in canada hold on what what is
[8996.60 --> 9004.84]  this calgary okay here we go the website is maple ridge paintball.ca here we go uh okay so uh one of
[9004.84 --> 9013.40]  some of the reasons that this location is garbage uh are subjective uh for example it's a 50 cal field
[9013.40 --> 9020.52]  which basically means that the the paintballs are smaller for the uninitiated that's going to sound big
[9020.52 --> 9027.56]  because of rifle rounds yeah but but uh standard paintballs are 68 cal so quite a bit larger now
[9027.56 --> 9035.24]  the benefit of 50 cal is that it's friendlier for like children um and people who are
[9036.44 --> 9043.40]  um so that's good it makes it a little bit easier to go do your like stag or corporate event or whatever
[9043.40 --> 9052.28]  else there um but it comes with some very objective problems um so one of them is that because they
[9052.28 --> 9058.52]  have less mass um they don't carry in a straight line for as long yeah wow they were inaccurate well
[9058.52 --> 9064.44]  there's multiple issues there yeah so okay sure let's talk about the inaccuracy so they're inaccurate
[9064.44 --> 9070.44]  and here are the other contributing factors to the inaccuracy um i don't i don't know how good the
[9070.44 --> 9076.20]  regulators are but none of our air tanks were full so they were they were kind of like they were full
[9076.20 --> 9081.72]  ish um the barrels are garbage on those rental markers which is pretty typical but they were
[9082.60 --> 9089.24]  garbage rental marker barrels and then number three is as far as i could tell looking at their their
[9089.24 --> 9098.04]  prep area their process for like for maintenance and cleaning was to like hose things down essentially
[9098.04 --> 9102.76]  um and like they they'd use a dirty barrel squeegee and be like okay you're good to go they actually
[9102.76 --> 9107.00]  got mad at me for taking my barrel off being like this is wet they're like no it's not i'm like bro
[9107.00 --> 9113.56]  quite bro it's it's wet there's absolutely no possibility whatsoever of a paintball coming out of
[9113.56 --> 9118.04]  this going in a straight line it's got in trouble yeah anyway snipped out and was like don't take the
[9118.04 --> 9124.92]  bro um so so so they're so they're inaccurate problem number two is that they because they have
[9124.92 --> 9130.68]  less momentum inertia kinetic energy let's go with that because they're carrying less kinetic energy
[9131.40 --> 9138.52]  but they have the same thickness of shell with less overall weight and a higher shell to goo ratio
[9138.52 --> 9142.84]  they're far less likely to break when they hit you so in many cases they can actually end up hurting more
[9142.84 --> 9147.96]  one one of the maps uh the actually the most fun map that we had i didn't really like the game modes
[9147.96 --> 9154.44]  that we did it felt designed to well i can get into that expend your paintballs but yes um one of the
[9154.44 --> 9159.32]  maps was a they call it capture the flag but it's really raise the flag so you had to pull on a rope
[9159.32 --> 9166.52]  and raise a flag um and one of the the ladies that wasn't in our group ran up to the flag and started
[9166.52 --> 9172.76]  pulling it up my brother just shot a million times and she was like reacting to all
[9172.76 --> 9177.16]  all the shots but the paintballs weren't breaking and the field rules were if the paintball doesn't
[9177.16 --> 9183.32]  break you're not out so she got shot a ton of times and it probably hurt quite a bit but we like
[9183.32 --> 9190.92]  won the round because the paintballs didn't break my brother was just like what like anyways for
[9190.92 --> 9197.96]  context they were on different teams yeah yeah um okay so that's that's issue number two with 50 cal
[9197.96 --> 9204.04]  issue number three is kind of tied into what luke just said where the game modes appeared to be
[9204.04 --> 9211.56]  designed to make you expend as much paint as possible so they did like constant respawning over longer
[9211.56 --> 9220.36]  rounds um they part of this is just new player behavior so i can't really blame the field for it but
[9220.36 --> 9225.48]  they have you so far away with this paint that is inaccurate and doesn't break that you
[9225.48 --> 9229.48]  you because you're a novice player and you don't understand you have to get closer to actually
[9229.48 --> 9235.96]  get it get a kill it was also difficult because i find the the 50 cal it was really hard to tell on
[9235.96 --> 9239.64]  the first map the speedball map you could kind of tell if you were hitting because you could hear it
[9239.64 --> 9246.28]  hit the drums but it's so hard to see like normal paintball whatever it makes a big mark normal to me
[9246.28 --> 9251.40]  paintball you can see a big mark i can also call as normal i can also often see the projectile i feel like
[9251.40 --> 9257.00]  yeah like i can tell if i'm firing properly with the 50 cal i couldn't tell if i was hitting or not
[9257.00 --> 9260.76]  so i had to kind of like shoot at someone for a little while then be like no okay i think they're
[9260.76 --> 9267.80]  out of range and then move closer um so so now problem number three is that you can fit so many
[9267.80 --> 9272.36]  paintballs into your into your hopper that it's easy to just like use everything without really
[9272.36 --> 9277.80]  thinking about it but that's that's as much a you know a player issue as it is anything else my my let's
[9277.80 --> 9285.40]  call this my real number three is that because 50 cal is a standard that nobody uses except crappy
[9286.68 --> 9292.68]  fields for like crappy rental markers there's a handful of conversion kits that i'm aware of but
[9292.68 --> 9299.80]  for the most part none of the custom decent equipment and i don't even mean high-end stuff like i never
[9299.80 --> 9307.16]  had a high-end marker i have an a5 it's just like a a beater huck it into the back of the car pretty standard
[9307.16 --> 9315.32]  like drop it in the mud and pull it out wipe it down and keep going marker um tipman yeah tipman a5 um
[9316.76 --> 9326.04]  no decent marker is available in 50 cal no decent barrels are available in 50 cal so i do understand
[9326.04 --> 9333.24]  why fields want to disincentivize these like gravy seals from showing up at the field with their fully
[9333.24 --> 9339.48]  auto that can be very annoying they're fully auto markers their crew of everybody in you know camo
[9339.48 --> 9342.20]  head to toe with a case of paint each and just like
[9343.96 --> 9348.84]  light everybody up like that's not fun for new players it kind of destroys the balance of the game
[9348.84 --> 9357.72]  i 100 get that but the flip side is i can't even use anything that fires reliably because like
[9357.72 --> 9363.40]  i had my a5 in my trunk it literally can't even use it because of their garbage field and their
[9363.40 --> 9370.04]  garbage 50 cal markers so so those are my issues with 50 cal my issues with the field are many
[9370.84 --> 9377.00]  they do have pricing on their website you can you can see if you go into pricing you can uh hold on
[9377.00 --> 9381.80]  hello there's probably a lot of people on it right now yeah so there's uh there's there's okay hold on
[9381.80 --> 9387.00]  me so we've got packages so you can have a look at adult paintball prices prices so you can see
[9387.00 --> 9393.48]  uh here's your 1999 admission includes four to five action-packed games blah blah blah blah blah blah
[9393.48 --> 9398.52]  uh oh packages on the day oh you can get the recruit pack commando pack black ops pack
[9398.52 --> 9401.96]  pack shows you all the things you get gloves a green guard blah blah blah gets all this stuff
[9401.96 --> 9415.80]  uh sorry what a half case for 160 canadian dollars yeah they don't they they warn you they tell you on
[9415.80 --> 9420.20]  the day remember i was with a group and a lot of people will be i mean so i was there with a group
[9420.20 --> 9426.12]  so they tell you on the day if it happened i didn't hear it the paint is it costs more after after your
[9426.12 --> 9431.48]  first round so you got to buy your package ahead of time but what they don't tell you is that everyone
[9431.48 --> 9436.36]  in your group has to buy the same package so if not everybody wants a black ops pack with a thousand
[9436.36 --> 9445.00]  paintballs um ts and basically 500 rounds sounds like a ton until your guns are incredibly for the
[9445.00 --> 9450.28]  basic recruit pack yeah until your guns are incredibly inaccurate and they have no range so you're like
[9450.28 --> 9456.60]  test firing 80 of your rounds and your guns are incredibly not 80 but a lot and your guns are
[9456.60 --> 9460.44]  incredibly inconsistent so you can't actually tell if they're even working or not half the time
[9460.44 --> 9467.40]  so you end up over firing a ton and i'm gonna get to the very worst part so the paint is
[9467.40 --> 9473.08]  ludicrously expensive which again i actually do understand the argument that i've heard for expensive
[9473.08 --> 9480.68]  paint at friendlier fields is that if you have those guys with their fully auto markers showing up and
[9480.68 --> 9485.80]  essentially playing speedball with nerf them a little bit with fish in a barrel you're you're basically
[9485.80 --> 9493.80]  trying to make it so it's like nickel nickel it makes people theoretically conserve conserve ammunition
[9493.80 --> 9500.44]  and it makes those like speedballer guys avoid those fields which is a more noob friendly environment
[9500.44 --> 9505.64]  or a more intermediate friendly environment so different fields are tailored to different groups
[9505.64 --> 9511.96]  and there will be days at some of the good fields i doubt delta force does this but there will be days at some of the good fields where it'll be like
[9511.96 --> 9518.92]  a bring your own gun only day and the paint's cheaper for example yeah yeah yeah um so i so
[9518.92 --> 9525.96]  i'm on board with that but 160 plus tax so the the total charge to my credit card was 180
[9527.08 --> 9537.32]  for a thousand rounds is utterly ludicrous it's crazy pricing ludicrous they couldn't even give me a full
[9537.32 --> 9543.96]  case for that they gave me half a case um and like there's a bunch of stuff that comes with it
[9543.96 --> 9549.72]  if you buy ahead of time and if you buy it after the fact you just get the paint and then you go holy
[9549.72 --> 9556.60]  crap that's expensive then they throw in like a couple little random little extra things like here is for um
[9557.80 --> 9565.96]  here's for context here's a 2000 count case of marbleizer from empire which i don't know if this is
[9565.96 --> 9570.60]  premium paint it probably isn't but i recognize the brand i haven't really played in a long time so
[9571.16 --> 9579.48]  whatever the point is 65 dollars so the markup on their cheap ass 50 cal remember less paint even
[9580.04 --> 9587.08]  the markup on their cheap ass 50 cal compared to badlands is what what's the math on this so it'd be like
[9587.08 --> 9594.60]  32.50 for a thousand at badlands so they're essentially charging me what does that work out to like
[9594.60 --> 9602.12]  five times the price ridiculous almost exactly and i haven't even told you guys the worst part
[9604.84 --> 9615.40]  they don't count headshots yeah that is beyond a shadow of a doubt designed to make it so that you just
[9616.12 --> 9623.32]  are plink plink plink wasting paint at each other because marker shots count but headshots and they didn't
[9623.32 --> 9627.88]  even mention that i had to ask yeah yeah headshots do not count
[9630.44 --> 9641.48]  75 percent of the exposed opponent is their head all you see is a hop or a barrel which you're not
[9641.48 --> 9650.12]  hitting with these useless markers yeah definitely and their head yeah so pretty much also the the safety
[9650.12 --> 9655.24]  never go there the safety presentation sales pitch i don't remember anything that was about safety
[9655.24 --> 9660.92]  other than headshots don't count and then and i don't think i'm exaggerating this time 80 of it was
[9660.92 --> 9669.24]  a sales pitch or more crazy crazy crazy crazy that being said and i was also to no uh positives of the
[9669.24 --> 9675.24]  field itself i had a pretty great time yeah yeah i just got paintball is just fun running around in a field
[9675.24 --> 9681.48]  with an objective is fine i got pretty mad about the number of times that my marker didn't work yeah
[9681.48 --> 9686.76]  and i had just bought a case of paint for the group so i had just spent like almost 200 dollars
[9687.32 --> 9694.76]  um and i sat out for probably a third of that round um actually probably more just like waiting around for
[9694.76 --> 9699.00]  like a replacement mark because so many people were getting replacements so i walked off i was basically
[9699.00 --> 9704.36]  like look i think that i should get a i should get a partial refund with all due respect uh this is you can't even
[9704.36 --> 9709.72]  play you only get three rounds you can't play this is this is ridiculous um i've had to replace my
[9709.72 --> 9715.24]  marker five times over one and a half rounds at this point because i walked off during the middle of the
[9715.24 --> 9721.16]  second round i was like this is ridiculous um and also i had hurt my ankle so i was like i yeah i i
[9721.16 --> 9727.00]  think i should get a partial refund like i'm done um and it wasn't even my money for the refund like it
[9727.00 --> 9733.16]  would have gone to the organizer who bless her did an amazing job of putting together an extremely special
[9733.72 --> 9740.68]  party for which was really cool genuinely really freaking um yeah so so anyway and they were
[9740.68 --> 9747.96]  basically just like no we're not interested they blamed it on the weather after buying the expensive
[9747.96 --> 9755.00]  case and i have played plenty in adverse weather conditions if your markers are maintained properly
[9755.00 --> 9762.84]  and not complete garbage in the first place they will operate just fine on a misty day like we had
[9763.32 --> 9769.16]  like yeah if you don't clean or dry anything yeah obviously like you know balls are gonna curve or
[9769.16 --> 9775.32]  whatever else but the way the guns were not firing at all or they were sputtering and you'd cock them back
[9775.32 --> 9780.68]  and there's just like so much paint casing just like caked into these things that you can't even you can't
[9780.68 --> 9784.92]  even properly pull the bolt all the way back or it'll go all the way back and it'll get wedged there
[9784.92 --> 9791.96]  and stuff like it's just poor maintenance don't tell me that it's because it's misting and also if it's
[9791.96 --> 9796.28]  misting in vancouver that's a pretty normal condition so you should probably account for it
[9797.16 --> 9804.12]  so yeah i i left them an absolutely scathing review on google maps and uh you delta force paintball
[9804.12 --> 9810.60]  there's also i don't know if you were there when we figured this out but a bunch of the google reviews
[9810.60 --> 9818.20]  talk about how they uh incentivize leaving five-star reviews yeah they have no like access to free water
[9818.20 --> 9822.76]  on site they don't have running water and they'll give you bottled water if you leave a five-star review
[9822.76 --> 9827.64]  right in front of them yeah so some of the negative reviews point that out they're like don't believe the
[9827.64 --> 9832.68]  five-star reviews they tried to get us to give them a positive review by like essentially bribing us with
[9832.68 --> 9838.60]  free water yeah because like i've i haven't gone paintballing very much but i've gone some amount
[9838.60 --> 9843.08]  of times probably half the amount of times i've gone i've been with linus um but i haven't had a
[9843.08 --> 9848.92]  field experience that bad before so i was stunned when i saw the rating was so high and then somebody in
[9848.92 --> 9855.08]  the group found that they had uh yeah there was a bunch a bunch of the low rating reviews were like
[9855.08 --> 9861.08]  i saw someone leaving a five-star review because of getting a free bottle of water or or whatever else
[9861.08 --> 9866.76]  um which is like ridiculous because it's effectively a paid review at that point
[9869.96 --> 9875.00]  yeah anyways apparently the fight's starting so should we just uh give up on retaining people
[9875.00 --> 9882.12]  on wancho at this point probably 8 30 yeah i gotta go so in one minute oh yeah right okay dan do you
[9882.12 --> 9886.60]  have any merch messages for us to kind of blow through here yeah sure uh let me do the after dark
[9886.60 --> 9893.16]  why are you getting position there heck yeah uh greetings dll waiting for cargo pants to come back
[9893.16 --> 9899.64]  in 32. i was wondering why ltd on the youtube mobile app has picture in picture without a premium
[9899.64 --> 9905.16]  membership can't do this on any other youtube channel apparently it was like a pilot program
[9905.16 --> 9910.04]  that they applied to our channel or something that's what i that's what i saw on reddit i don't
[9910.04 --> 9915.56]  actually know anything about this i don't remember anything so there you go by the way i got you something
[9915.56 --> 9924.28]  me yeah your sweater what is this oh my god this is horrible i suck
[9928.04 --> 9939.32]  oh nice nice these coffee zilla uh shirts arrived a thousand years ago they've just been sitting on
[9939.32 --> 9945.08]  the set i keep forgetting to bring them out um so this was from the speaking of the paul brothers
[9945.56 --> 9953.72]  um this is funding coffee zilla's um legal battle with which which paul is he fighting with
[9954.36 --> 9960.60]  uh i think it's logan paul coffee zilla yeah logan paul yeah it's logan paul so the the one that isn't
[9960.60 --> 9970.28]  fighting mike tyson so uh there you go and it says um i used to like coffee zilla until he investigated me
[9970.28 --> 9975.00]  which i thought was pretty funny because he actually did upload an investigation of me at one point but i still
[9975.00 --> 9983.24]  like him i went to micro center recently and i noticed the oled monitors looked much worse than
[9983.24 --> 9989.64]  the oled tvs i see on display at costco is this a windows issue or oled panels just that different
[9989.64 --> 9996.76]  it's probably a windows hdr issue um oled monitors should look pretty good might have been a content
[9996.76 --> 10001.88]  issue as well not everyone setting up a retail display knows what the crap they're doing long time
[10001.88 --> 10005.96]  listener first time merch messenger i don't think we're calling them out anymore but okay
[10005.96 --> 10011.88]  how has your experience been maintaining both a forum versus a discord server what led to the
[10011.88 --> 10015.64]  creation of the ltd discord we don't really maintain the discord server
[10018.84 --> 10024.84]  to my knowledge um i prefer forums i never really go on the discord but i still use the forum
[10024.84 --> 10032.44]  i've been on the discord a couple times i think i don't know it just kind of moves too fast for me
[10032.44 --> 10039.16]  i'm too old there's the float plane chat on the discord so i lurk that um but i am i'm traditionally a
[10039.16 --> 10043.48]  lurker like ocn back in the day ncx forums back in the day all that kind of stuff i didn't really post
[10043.48 --> 10047.72]  much just kind of hung around long time listener first time conquer
[10047.72 --> 10059.00]  love it thanks full plane chat they're one of the chats of all time hey the genius the bird whisperer
[10059.00 --> 10069.16]  and linus gotta butter up the curator well it worked no i hate that uh to linus genius bird whisperer do
[10069.16 --> 10075.64]  you really just reheat your family's friday night dinner when when goes really long um i mean friday i'm
[10075.64 --> 10079.32]  never there for dinner so realistically that's one of the nights that they have something i don't
[10079.32 --> 10084.84]  like so i'll just like have breakfast cereal for dinner or i'll make i'll make like a i'll make like
[10084.84 --> 10090.76]  a tray of like cheese triscuits i have food prep so i go to the fridge and go into microwave three minutes
[10091.32 --> 10099.72]  eat cottage cheese um i think i'd rather die than eat cottage cheese cottage cheese chicken it actually
[10099.72 --> 10105.56]  has the consistency of vomit and i can't i can't abide it what's the name of bok choy cottage
[10105.56 --> 10114.20]  cheese chicken rice frank's red terrible add the frank's red good huh interesting
[10116.60 --> 10123.00]  hi ll and dan it's the day of my cousin's wedding and i got a cold just to mess with my day
[10123.56 --> 10128.60]  what's the most inconvenient time you've gotten sick at the wedding reception right now it's a hoot
[10128.60 --> 10136.52]  inconvenient the most recent scrapyard war super inconvenient that sucked inconvenient time i've
[10136.52 --> 10147.40]  gotten sick uh was i sick at ltx once i'm not sure i don't remember i just uh i don't have time to be
[10147.40 --> 10155.24]  sick so it's um like i usually just work through it um i did take a sick day this week but that's
[10155.24 --> 10161.40]  pretty like one that is pretty unusual monday does that even count if it was monday yeah monday's my
[10161.40 --> 10166.44]  work from home day but i was supposed to be in office this monday i think no no i no i was at dbrand
[10166.44 --> 10174.36]  this monday i was in toronto this monday and i was uh still not feeling 100 but i just yeah like yeah
[10175.88 --> 10181.16]  uh no it was for last friday and i just still came in for wan show oh yeah yeah i think that was it or
[10181.16 --> 10189.56]  maybe it was thursday i don't know the point is um inconvenient sickness there's some really funny
[10189.56 --> 10194.68]  videos i think there's like an asus monitor video from years and years ago where like my voice is like
[10194.68 --> 10200.12]  super low like frog croaky uh i missed a shoot on thursday that's what that's what it was last week i
[10200.12 --> 10204.68]  missed a shoot on thursday because i was sick and we've actually got a clip of me calling in sick
[10204.68 --> 10211.56]  ivan's got her phone next to me my voice is hilarious like it's one of those situations where
[10211.56 --> 10217.72]  when you call in sick you call and you say hello and your boss is like oh you're sick see you in a
[10217.72 --> 10223.64]  bit yeah yeah like i sounded horrible it was a different era you know pre-covid was actually a
[10223.64 --> 10228.04]  very different time it's hard to reframe and remember what things were like so i'm just prefacing
[10228.04 --> 10235.00]  it with that but at one of the packs east i was sick uh and i didn't know about you know
[10236.68 --> 10242.68]  syrup at that time and i don't think you know i had enough to do anything like that but i had uh
[10243.72 --> 10255.16]  buckley's oh boy and oh candy little uh sugar candy o-ring looking things and before every major take
[10255.16 --> 10262.04]  i would take some buckley's and an o-ring and then i'd just go for it and i was just one-shotting
[10262.04 --> 10267.24]  every single video so every major take was essentially a whole video and then we would we
[10267.24 --> 10273.16]  would go to the next one and then like i couldn't talk and then i would take some some buckley's and
[10274.28 --> 10279.00]  eat the gummy so that i could get rid of the like cringe basically and then just send it and do
[10279.00 --> 10284.36]  another video i thought we were just slamming lean we did basically yeah crazy yeah
[10286.44 --> 10291.16]  i don't think it was enough to like actually do anything wow because i was just taking like
[10291.16 --> 10297.48]  little yeah little bits i don't know i don't think it was enough yeah um years later i heard about that
[10297.48 --> 10305.16]  and was like huh that's just what you did i wonder if that affected me um i again i don't think it was
[10305.16 --> 10309.72]  actually enough to to really do anything no you need very specific brands of codeine sort of uh
[10309.72 --> 10315.08]  but you like i don't know anything about this shut up you couldn't understand me talking and i had to
[10315.08 --> 10319.56]  host videos and there wasn't really another solution i wasn't going to not host the videos so it was like
[10319.56 --> 10325.40]  okay we're just doing it i'm trying to think what's like a crazy thing i've missed because of being sick
[10325.40 --> 10330.68]  but nothing comes to mind i also just have a mind like a sieve so who knows for certain things
[10330.68 --> 10338.12]  hey everyone my company is currently running an insane cost savings program and cut our microsoft
[10338.12 --> 10344.60]  office licenses to browser use only what are your thoughts on cost savings that result in unproductivity
[10344.60 --> 10348.76]  well they aren't really cost savings then are they yeah you're shifting expenses
[10350.76 --> 10357.00]  um i mean it is a big decrease in cost but it's a big decrease in cost of like 10 bucks a person
[10357.00 --> 10363.88]  so yeah and it so it so it depends on like what you're doing um it also depends like
[10365.24 --> 10370.04]  not to call you out in certain cases it could be a user issue or like the browser thing might be fine
[10370.04 --> 10378.60]  now if you're doing advanced stuff with excel that is not true the local version just is better um so i
[10378.60 --> 10383.24]  don't know for you maybe it is actually nerfing you but you know i think sometimes people just hate change
[10383.24 --> 10388.52]  change and there's a significantly cheaper way to do certain things and sometimes you just got
[10388.52 --> 10396.52]  to kind of catch up i think both can be true um yeah i can also understand like if an employer is
[10398.20 --> 10404.04]  better to cut office than to cut exactly if they're having a really hard time making ends meet for a
[10404.04 --> 10408.84]  while and they're like well then you might want to be pretty supportive of the cost saving measures
[10408.84 --> 10415.24]  that are that don't involve people yeah so like try to make it work that's all i can really say
[10416.04 --> 10423.56]  hi dll i just built an mff pc with a btf motherboard there are very few cases and even fewer motherboards
[10423.56 --> 10429.40]  support this standard what do you think about the btf standard is it a dead tech i hope it's not dead i
[10429.40 --> 10435.56]  think it's kind of cool um it seems to be more of a thing in china than it is in north america but um
[10435.56 --> 10441.72]  um i yeah i guess we'll i guess the only only time will tell the good news is that if you buy a case
[10442.28 --> 10447.08]  um most of the ones that i've seen that are back to front compatible with the rear connectors like
[10447.08 --> 10453.16]  on the back side uh are also compatible with regular boards so you can build a btf system now and then you
[10453.16 --> 10457.88]  can just put a regular motherboard in your case if it doesn't end up being a thing so it's it's something
[10457.88 --> 10462.44]  that doesn't really cost anything to buy into other than just that it limits your case selection
[10462.44 --> 10466.36]  i think it's cool though
[10468.12 --> 10474.28]  what's up with sorry what's up with all these one-time drops recently like the dip dye hoodie
[10474.28 --> 10480.44]  not having restocks um also any plans to do classic t-shirts again i don't know i think we uh i think we
[10480.44 --> 10490.92]  struggle sometimes especially with apparel to um to turn one-time buys into run rate business and
[10490.92 --> 10495.56]  uh i think part of the problem has been that our skew mix got too broad for a while there
[10496.20 --> 10500.76]  part of the problem is that we still have a lot to learn about marketing that isn't just
[10500.76 --> 10507.56]  leveraging our social channels and our youtube channels um but the reality of it is those items
[10507.56 --> 10514.04]  that we sell through and then don't restock we don't restock because they just don't have the demand
[10514.04 --> 10520.20]  to sustain another order at the at the large minimum order quantities i think people underestimate how many of
[10520.20 --> 10527.24]  something you have to order when you're not just like paying slave wages to some poor temu schlub
[10527.80 --> 10537.56]  um to to effectively like carbon copy one-offs you know like uh we can't just make 30 of something we
[10538.20 --> 10544.52]  we have to make 3 000 of something so if if it takes us five months to move through them we're not going to reorder them
[10544.52 --> 10548.52]  um
[10549.16 --> 10554.52]  hi lld i think i remember luke mentioning the possibility of a creator warehouse gym bag any
[10554.52 --> 10559.24]  updates on whether this is still you know he said he wanted one uh we are not working on that right now
[10559.80 --> 10566.12]  why not um because we can only don't defend yourself it's fine it's fine it's fine uh hey lld as long as you
[10566.12 --> 10573.72]  spend all your time working on tall shirts uh hey lld my work did a team building exercise and got me thinking
[10573.72 --> 10579.24]  what's the most surprising thing you've learned about yourself since starting ltt and how has it impacted your choices from
[10579.88 --> 10580.68]  for the brand
[10583.08 --> 10583.88]  we're approaching
[10585.16 --> 10586.60]  we're not that far away
[10586.60 --> 10598.12]  we're not that far away from this being half of our lives so almost everything yeah i mean most of
[10598.12 --> 10603.80]  my adult life is linus media group now yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's kind of crazy to think about
[10603.80 --> 10610.60]  it that way but it's totally true more than half of my life is yvonne era and more than half of my adult
[10610.60 --> 10614.92]  life is lmg era so um
[10617.40 --> 10622.60]  you had a career level job before this i didn't even this is my first career level job this is
[10622.60 --> 10627.88]  technically my first job out of post-secondary i think it's kind of cool that we think of it as a
[10627.88 --> 10632.28]  career level job now you know that wasn't how we felt about it in the early days that is very true
[10633.16 --> 10635.56]  um that's an achievement unlocked i suppose
[10635.56 --> 10640.52]  yeah man what did we what did we learn about ourselves
[10644.76 --> 10647.96]  i had to i had a lot of growing up to do
[10649.96 --> 10655.96]  me too that was that was a big thing for me i had to kind of like tear down a version of myself and
[10655.96 --> 10660.84]  sort of rebuild yeah because i was like certain ways that i'm like reacting to things certain ways
[10660.84 --> 10666.60]  that i'm dealing with certain problems are just like not cool like i need to fix this and that was
[10666.60 --> 10672.28]  not the easiest thing in the world but i think i more or less did it um and that was largely driven by
[10673.72 --> 10681.16]  work to be honest i've definitely made observations but i don't know how many of them i didn't know
[10681.16 --> 10688.36]  because to luke's point i had a job before like i even had like a somewhat of a leadership position before
[10688.36 --> 10699.32]  um i've definitely had a lot of things confirmed i have i i don't suffer fools well i uh i can be a
[10699.32 --> 10705.64]  bit of a control freak those two things are pretty related both of those though that wasn't a learning
[10705.64 --> 10708.84]  experience a lot of the reason that we started lmg
[10708.84 --> 10719.80]  i didn't want to work for someone who wasn't um you a mentor and didn't i believe have the capacity to be a mentor
[10721.00 --> 10721.24]  um
[10723.72 --> 10727.24]  someone said you've previously previously shared that you get hype about big challenges yeah but i
[10727.24 --> 10733.16]  already knew that yeah um yeah he definitely knew that like a lot of core parts of who i am already
[10733.16 --> 10738.44]  already knew like i i would like to think that by the time you hit your 20s you kind of know who you
[10738.44 --> 10746.68]  are as a person i've some in some ways learned to be way more patient and keep my cards closer to my
[10746.68 --> 10753.16]  chest yes but in other ways i've completely lost my patience because i've just seen everything so many
[10753.16 --> 10761.32]  times like like i can in in ways that only business owners can understand i have seen
[10763.08 --> 10772.12]  i've seen so many train wrecks that the second the locomotive goes on the rails i know what's going to
[10772.12 --> 10779.96]  happen and it can be very frustrating for me to watch everybody else go let's see how it plays out um
[10779.96 --> 10788.20]  um you know you and and pain is nature's teacher right so so i need to let it happen i've learned
[10788.20 --> 10793.16]  these lessons through pain and i understand that the only way other people can properly learn them
[10793.16 --> 10798.68]  is through pain um but it can be exhausting to to not have people just
[10802.04 --> 10809.00]  listen um but it doesn't work that way people have to learn for themselves and and what's frustrating
[10809.00 --> 10812.44]  it's literally a management tactic where you have to kind of pick your battles there where if if you
[10812.44 --> 10817.96]  think okay i am 99 sure this is going to fail they really want to try it i don't think the impact on
[10817.96 --> 10823.72]  this is going to be super big okay and and what's really frustrating though is like as a business owner
[10823.72 --> 10834.36]  right is that their their fail pain is not real it's just like oh i am i am i am morale sad it didn't
[10834.36 --> 10840.92]  hit their wallet you know they take home the same pay that day in a lot of cases um it's also the equal
[10840.92 --> 10844.76]  and opposite of that though is when they have huge successes it also doesn't hit their wall yeah that's
[10844.76 --> 10850.20]  true i mean that's that's the dynamic right that's why that's why a lot of people decide to take the
[10850.20 --> 10856.44]  paycheck and why fewer people decide to take the entrepreneurial path insulated from the ups and downs yep
[10856.44 --> 10862.60]  not entirely yeah but day to day yeah in a big way
[10867.64 --> 10872.60]  next sure thing hey dll y'all got me buying hoodies every week let's go
[10873.48 --> 10880.20]  uh the phone pocket is so nice who at lt came up with it and what other neat features have you
[10880.20 --> 10885.56]  creators come up with and uh their dishwasher is still broken apparently oh you should probably spend
[10885.56 --> 10891.56]  money on your dishwasher instead of an 80 hoodie but um how are they gonna watch 60 hoodie and a 20
[10891.56 --> 10896.76]  t-shirt sorry sorry uh i don't remember um
[10899.72 --> 10904.92]  nick would probably remember but there is absolutely no way that he is doing anything other than watching
[10904.92 --> 10910.12]  the fight right now and he does not want to talk to me right now that's true so um it's true i don't
[10910.12 --> 10915.24]  know it was linus we're gonna say i think it i think it might have been me but i'm not a hundred
[10915.24 --> 10920.84]  percent did it come from did the original land hoodie have it or we don't buy it from that no okay
[10920.84 --> 10928.60]  i don't know i could be wrong i'm not sure i could be wrong i you know what i i don't remember it might
[10928.60 --> 10932.52]  have been me it might have been nick it might have been lloyd it might have been just something we saw
[10932.52 --> 10940.36]  somewhere i'm not sure howdy dll faithful vod listener here i'm repainting my room soon and i'd like to know
[10940.36 --> 10945.24]  how you do edges you said before that tape just slows you down i'm curious how a master like you
[10945.24 --> 10949.48]  does it i'm not a master i'm just i have a reasonably steady hand and an ounce of common
[10949.48 --> 10955.56]  sense that's painting and highly opinionated painting is not rocket surgery um basically
[10955.56 --> 10960.76]  you dip about this deep into the paint you whack it against the sides of the can it's called bang loading
[10961.32 --> 10967.88]  um don't worry about it i'm saying nothing you hold it like a pencil okay so not like this
[10967.88 --> 10974.44]  like this like this and then uh you should be using a i think it's called a sash brush so basically
[10974.44 --> 10982.12]  where it's like uh where it goes down but it's angled at the bottom and so you the the very longest
[10982.12 --> 10986.92]  part is the part that does the finest edge and then you use the the shorter part to kind of put on
[10986.92 --> 10991.88]  the bulk of it and then you just paint a paint a straight line uh i think the brush is something that
[10991.88 --> 10995.80]  i'd been missing for a long time i didn't realize that there was a specific kind of angled brush that
[10995.80 --> 11000.44]  really helps with that uh-huh yeah that's good advice if you try and do that with just like a
[11000.44 --> 11007.48]  blunt square brush you you're you're like yeah you can't edge like that tools really help yes um and
[11007.48 --> 11013.08]  last one i got for you now hey dll i live in the us and need to upgrade my gpu with the looming
[11013.08 --> 11017.72]  potential tariffs do you all think i should get the 4 000 series on black friday or still wait for the
