[0.00 → 5.60] I would like the first words I say to not be cut off this time.
[6.24 → 9.94] I've been told that the last couple of streams we've done, the first word's been cut off.
[10.18 → 10.94] Oh, you're too fast.
[11.00 → 13.26] I gave myself a longer millennial pause.
[14.02 → 17.68] And it is going to be a great WAN show, worth waiting for!
[18.68 → 19.88] For a couple of seconds.
[20.96 → 25.18] We are going to be doing a video soon on kind of tech gripes.
[25.72 → 27.06] And so that's where the title comes from.
[27.06 → 30.14] I've got 99 problems, and I'll make a video on some.
[30.60 → 33.28] So we're going to be giving you guys some of the gripes that we found.
[33.40 → 37.42] We'll be taking suggestions from you guys, getting some verification from you guys.
[37.48 → 41.82] Because, hey, if there's an easy workaround, then we don't want to waste anybody's time in our tech gripes video.
[42.12 → 45.78] We are looking to have things actually solved here.
[46.40 → 51.62] In other news, HP is downgrading printer features when you don't buy genuine ink.
[52.32 → 57.02] It's not as bad as it sounds, but given that it sounds so bad, that's a really low bar.
[57.12 → 58.28] What else we got this week, Luke?
[58.80 → 63.22] We have an update on FTC banning hidden fees from hotel and ticket prices.
[63.68 → 66.06] I believe last time we talked about it, it was a possibility.
[66.26 → 68.44] And now there's a date, which is good.
[68.54 → 72.38] That's three topics, though, that are not going to keep people engaged for a whole show.
[72.48 → 73.78] Can you pick one good one?
[76.28 → 77.46] Oh, terrible.
[79.04 → 79.40] Terrible.
[79.40 → 85.34] There's definitely going to be inappropriate mods for Final Fantasy VII.
[94.08 → 95.12] I'll keep them here.
[96.98 → 97.92] They'll be alert.
[101.46 → 102.44] They'll be attempted.
[102.44 → 116.32] The show is brought to you today by Ridge, Rocket Money, Pulse way, and the quiet move we pulled where we doubled our sponsors with LG as our laptop partner,
[116.74 → 120.48] Brand as our wrap partner, and Secret Lab as our chair partner.
[120.78 → 122.10] That was quite the gamer move.
[122.30 → 123.98] Dude, no one called us on it.
[124.12 → 124.34] Yeah.
[124.34 → 125.40] Literally no one.
[125.48 → 125.92] That's good stuff.
[126.18 → 127.24] The business team over there, man.
[127.30 → 128.00] They're just cooking.
[128.12 → 128.82] Go business team.
[128.90 → 130.36] Just wait until we double it again.
[130.46 → 131.76] You're going to see.
[131.92 → 132.70] Yeah, how can we do that?
[132.72 → 133.38] There's got to be a way.
[133.48 → 133.80] All right.
[133.86 → 137.76] So we are making a video with complaints about tech.
[137.86 → 143.06] Not big complaints like the ongoing march towards zero ownership and liking it,
[143.12 → 146.62] the complete disregard for the ecological impact of AI,
[146.84 → 149.52] or the justification of absolutely everything.
[149.52 → 157.32] We're talking small things like how cookie settings are specifically designed to be user hostile and intimidating.
[157.50 → 159.42] So you'll just click invade my primacy.
[160.48 → 161.90] Invade my primacy.
[162.06 → 162.82] Do it now.
[163.52 → 164.44] Invade my privacy.
[165.02 → 169.52] Or how power saving mode on Windows 11 renders the battery icon useless.
[169.68 → 170.50] You ever notice that?
[170.84 → 170.98] No.
[171.20 → 172.36] Power saving mode comes on.
[172.42 → 173.34] You get the little icon.
[173.46 → 174.30] You can't tell how full it is.
[174.30 → 175.50] Oh, yeah, because it puts the thing in front of it.
[175.50 → 177.10] Because it puts the thing in the front.
[177.10 → 182.18] But we've got other good stuff to do with the notification tray on Windows,
[182.46 → 186.28] like how if you have a bunch of them queued up, and you're trying to click something behind them
[186.28 → 190.90] while they, one after another, come up and get in your way, it's actually impossible.
[191.26 → 192.48] Windows search has got to be in here.
[193.38 → 194.14] No, no.
[194.32 → 195.02] We want...
[195.02 → 197.78] This is supposed to be like nitpicks.
[198.30 → 200.94] It's supposed to be little specific details.
[200.96 → 202.16] Not like major problems.
[202.24 → 204.14] Yeah, it can't be major problems.
[204.14 → 204.62] Got it.
[204.62 → 210.16] So one of the ones that bothers me a lot for this one, we're going to go...
[210.16 → 215.72] And so the goal here, guys, is for you to tell us, hey, there's a super easy workaround to that.
[216.84 → 218.44] All you had to do was this.
[218.48 → 220.50] So we can make sure we don't waste anyone's time.
[220.60 → 224.36] You guys are being our fact-checking department here.
[224.36 → 230.06] So we're going to take a little trip to my inbox, going to Linus Laptop.
[230.16 → 230.82] Here we go.
[231.00 → 231.24] Boom.
[231.34 → 232.34] My spam folder.
[232.86 → 233.48] Let's go.
[233.58 → 236.06] Oh, I'm getting some info from Scientology.
[236.18 → 236.68] Here we go.
[237.16 → 241.70] So this is something that drives me absolutely knocking Fitz.
[241.90 → 246.74] If I find something in here like, oh, oh, this Zoom meeting.
[246.90 → 250.30] Here, let's find something that's just absolutely like the worst.
[250.30 → 254.24] I'm sure Brighter.
[254.28 → 257.94] I don't even know what Brighter is, but I don't recommend it because they spam me.
[258.36 → 258.62] Okay?
[258.70 → 259.90] So I'm going to click on this.
[260.42 → 260.68] Okay?
[260.90 → 264.90] If I say not spam, watch what happens.
[265.16 → 266.00] Watch what happens.
[269.70 → 270.84] What happened, Luke?
[271.58 → 272.36] It went away.
[272.58 → 273.64] It went away.
[274.04 → 275.82] I'm still in my spam folder.
[276.14 → 276.92] I don't...
[276.92 → 278.10] Do you know where it went?
[278.10 → 280.76] I'm assuming to you're unread.
[280.96 → 282.32] It went to my inbox.
[282.60 → 285.42] It did not mark unread.
[285.84 → 286.26] Oh.
[286.54 → 291.00] It goes in a red state to your inbox.
[291.22 → 292.12] So it disappears.
[292.24 → 293.40] So it disappears.
[293.40 → 295.78] Because it's no longer on your screen, and it's now marked red.
[296.10 → 297.04] Which I have been...
[297.04 → 298.16] Which I have been...
[298.16 → 300.64] Which I have been meaning to deal with.
[301.24 → 303.70] Which I've been meaning to talk about for a long time.
[303.76 → 306.84] Because this is the kind of little thing that drives me absolutely nuts.
[306.84 → 307.88] I haven't replied to this.
[308.34 → 309.84] I haven't actioned it in any way.
[310.28 → 314.22] All that happened was I saw something that I was like, oh shoot.
[314.84 → 315.84] That's not spam.
[316.16 → 322.64] And the reason this came up was an introduction that Iraq, the CEO of Framework, wanted to make for me.
[323.06 → 324.08] So he emails me.
[324.14 → 327.76] He's like, hey, here's someone who's working on something cool that might interest you.
[328.02 → 329.46] Are you interested in an intro?
[329.46 → 330.14] I go, yes.
[330.94 → 333.18] And then he says, okay, sure thing.
[333.24 → 334.16] I'll make the intro.
[334.40 → 335.02] And then nothing...
[335.02 → 335.54] It never happens.
[335.72 → 336.94] And then the intro never happened.
[337.00 → 338.44] A week later, I get a ping.
[338.56 → 339.58] I think it was from Iraq.
[339.62 → 340.18] I don't remember.
[340.30 → 341.46] But he's basically like...
[342.94 → 343.96] I thought this was cool.
[343.96 → 345.42] Hey, I thought I was making an intro.
[345.42 → 346.74] You said you were cool with it.
[346.78 → 347.78] You don't reply to people.
[348.10 → 348.76] Maybe he didn't.
[348.86 → 349.46] Maybe I just...
[349.46 → 351.36] Maybe I projected all of that onto myself.
[351.36 → 358.24] When I found a week-old email in my inbox from Buddy Who's Working on the Cool Thing that just went to my spam.
[358.44 → 359.30] And get this.
[359.36 → 359.64] Get this.
[359.68 → 360.64] It gets even worse.
[360.92 → 363.88] Because I did realize that this would happen.
[363.98 → 366.08] Because I've encountered this before, and it annoys me.
[366.20 → 367.08] So I found it.
[367.12 → 367.60] I marked it.
[367.86 → 368.58] Not spam.
[368.80 → 372.94] And remember how Gmail used to have a function to mark a sender safe?
[373.50 → 373.68] Yeah.
[374.62 → 375.90] Well, that's gone.
[376.18 → 379.08] So I've had people multiple times email me.
[379.08 → 379.24] Oh, no.
[379.24 → 380.42] And end up in my spam.
[380.54 → 384.04] Because there's no obvious way to mark a sender safe.
[384.62 → 385.08] So anyway.
[385.34 → 385.82] So anyway.
[386.10 → 386.72] I go.
[386.90 → 387.92] I dig it out of my inbox.
[388.10 → 390.26] I make sure I remember the name of the person who sent it.
[390.44 → 390.68] Right?
[390.96 → 392.50] So I can go search for it in my inbox.
[392.58 → 394.70] Because I use my inbox like a to-do list.
[395.18 → 398.18] So I have sometimes 100 unread items in my inbox.
[398.40 → 400.00] And anything that's red is gone.
[400.26 → 402.60] I'd be okay if it had to basically reload.
[402.80 → 404.78] Like if it moved it and then reopened it for you.
[405.04 → 405.24] Sure.
[405.36 → 405.86] I'd be fine with that.
[405.86 → 406.62] That would be fine.
[406.62 → 407.38] I'd be fine with that.
[407.62 → 408.62] If it had to be that kind of thing.
[408.62 → 409.00] So I went.
[409.08 → 409.78] I remembered the name.
[409.90 → 410.16] I went.
[410.28 → 411.02] I got it.
[411.12 → 412.24] And I replied to it.
[412.26 → 414.74] I was like, hey, can you have your people schedule a time with my people?
[414.84 → 415.84] And I cc'd my people.
[415.94 → 416.30] Get this.
[416.66 → 417.32] Buddy replies.
[417.42 → 418.74] He's like, here are some good times for me.
[419.90 → 421.74] Vance had it go to his spam.
[422.70 → 427.60] So he only saw it to set up a time because he happened to check his spam.
[427.60 → 429.70] What is this person sending from?
[429.78 → 430.98] It sounds like their domain is.
[431.72 → 434.36] I mean, I can check now.
[434.82 → 435.80] I can check now.
[435.92 → 437.88] It's probably a relatively new domain.
[438.12 → 439.04] I can tell you that.
[439.40 → 440.80] No, it's a Gmail account.
[441.80 → 444.62] Amir A in full plain chat said, read the notification.
[444.76 → 445.94] It does mark the sender safe.
[446.82 → 448.54] So maybe it's just like a combo button now.
[448.66 → 449.60] Except if it didn't.
[450.60 → 452.12] I swear to you.
[452.62 → 456.76] I swear on my mother's grave that I have had it happen.
[456.80 → 457.44] My mother's not dead.
[457.88 → 461.30] That I've had it happen where I have said this is not spam.
[461.64 → 463.56] And anyway, we work in a Google.
[463.56 → 466.36] We work in a Google G Suite domain.
[466.84 → 468.20] I marked it safe.
[469.02 → 471.50] So why is it going to Vance's spam then?
[471.58 → 472.68] That just happened.
[473.36 → 475.32] Like just, just now.
[475.50 → 476.12] Just happened.
[476.26 → 476.36] Yeah.
[476.36 → 480.14] I don't know if like marked safe senders is, is workspace wide.
[480.28 → 483.16] I mean, should it be a an indicator?
[485.36 → 487.46] Maybe from, I don't know.
[487.60 → 488.06] To be honest.
[488.12 → 488.74] I don't think so.
[489.08 → 489.28] Yeah.
[489.28 → 490.12] Because I mean, okay.
[490.12 → 490.74] I could see.
[491.26 → 497.44] Cause while it could be a good indicator for safe senders, assuming everyone is like savvy
[497.44 → 498.24] and does it properly.
[498.32 → 498.42] Yeah.
[498.42 → 498.90] It might not be.
[498.90 → 501.84] But it could also, it could also amplify bamboozlement.
[502.36 → 504.00] So that's potentially dangerous.
[504.10 → 504.36] You're right.
[504.48 → 504.68] Yeah.
[504.68 → 510.58] And if you, if you like, yeah, I don't know if you, if you convince someone through social
[510.58 → 516.02] engineering on a completely unrelated team, but within the same organization that you are
[516.02 → 520.28] a safe sender, and then you send garbage to other people on the team knowing that you're
[520.28 → 521.56] manually flagged as safe.
[521.70 → 521.88] Yep.
[521.92 → 522.30] That's fair.
[522.36 → 523.80] From this random person in the company.
[523.88 → 525.84] Asaph 400 says, happened to me this week.
[525.98 → 526.74] Marked not spam.
[526.92 → 528.12] Same sender went to spam.
[528.48 → 532.62] Um, also other emails from the same sender still stuck in spam, each needing to be manually
[532.62 → 533.28] put in the inbox.
[533.28 → 535.46] So, so that's, that's mine.
[535.60 → 539.62] That's my contribution to the, uh, the tech gripes video.
[539.62 → 540.96] We've got a couple of other ones.
[541.42 → 542.58] Um, here's one.
[542.72 → 547.70] There's still, still no good way to transfer files from Android to iOS.
[548.40 → 549.44] Android has quick share.
[549.72 → 555.80] iOS has airdrop, but there is no like rock solid way to share files between devices.
[555.80 → 559.88] Furthermore, it can be a challenge to get files to a PC as well.
[560.22 → 562.82] That should be with Wi-Fi direct.
[563.14 → 564.82] That should be such a solved problem.
[564.82 → 567.40] And there are, there are ways to do it.
[567.52 → 571.92] Like, it's not like you can't pair your Android phone to your, uh, to your Windows PC.
[571.92 → 574.88] It's, it's a whole thing when you're setting up windows, it prompts you to do it and everything,
[574.88 → 576.04] but that's not what we're talking about.
[576.08 → 580.14] We're talking about Luke snaps a quick picture on his phone and is like, Hey, can I send this
[580.14 → 580.48] to you?
[581.08 → 586.44] And I'm like, yo, I just turned on my sharing airdrop style, and it just farts over onto
[586.44 → 592.70] the laptop that, uh, that, that, that needs to, that needs to be a thing.
[592.88 → 594.02] Google quick share that works.
[594.10 → 594.46] I love it.
[594.52 → 597.88] Isn't that more, uh, Android, Android?
[598.30 → 601.50] Not KDE connect.
[601.64 → 607.38] I mean, I can already tell you just from the name of it that that is not going to be what
[607.38 → 617.00] like my aunt is going to use, um, sale ash says, share it used to be the app to do it
[617.00 → 618.76] until Apple removed it from the app store.
[618.88 → 619.20] Oh man.
[619.24 → 619.90] I love that.
[619.98 → 621.30] It's Android to windows.
[621.42 → 621.54] Yeah.
[621.60 → 622.60] It doesn't solve the problem.
[622.74 → 623.42] I love that.
[623.54 → 626.62] I'm going to put down, I'm going to put down a few of these for us to look into.
[626.74 → 628.38] I've got local send here.
[628.78 → 630.78] Someone's like, I just use discord.
[631.22 → 633.00] Oh, that is so sad.
[633.28 → 635.38] That should not be the way that is.
[635.56 → 636.88] That is largely what I do though.
[636.88 → 638.36] That is actually sad.
[638.46 → 639.12] I agree.
[639.36 → 640.20] Actual ass.
[640.36 → 640.88] I fully agree.
[640.98 → 641.68] That is ass.
[641.84 → 645.66] And I don't mean like, but I don't mean like attractive, like thick ass.
[645.76 → 647.88] I mean like, like with hair everywhere.
[648.66 → 648.96] Oh yeah.
[649.04 → 654.10] Like everywhere, like long, like, like on your head long, like, like just like shaggy.
[654.46 → 654.72] Yeah.
[654.96 → 655.92] Shaggy ass.
[658.16 → 659.16] What else we got?
[660.18 → 661.02] Windows settings.
[661.02 → 661.48] Someone's probably into that.
[661.78 → 662.72] Windows settings.
[662.84 → 663.52] Here's a good one.
[663.52 → 667.78] Why is windows settings limited to a single window?
[668.78 → 673.40] Have you noticed that the modern settings menu, you can only have one window open?
[674.14 → 674.44] Yeah.
[674.74 → 675.22] Yeah.
[675.76 → 676.30] That's annoying.
[676.42 → 676.76] Yeah.
[676.98 → 677.72] What the heck?
[678.04 → 678.24] Yeah.
[678.48 → 679.96] It's not like game breaking, but it's annoying.
[680.08 → 680.22] Okay.
[680.22 → 682.36] I think I'm starting to embrace the theme.
[682.48 → 687.30] And since we're in the settings menu, since, since we're talking about it, why exactly
[687.30 → 691.86] is it that time and language is deserving of space here?
[692.12 → 703.60] When display, sound, power and battery, these are all things that do not merit the top level
[703.60 → 707.98] of the sidebar, are you kidding me?
[709.50 → 710.28] That's pretty rough.
[710.60 → 713.02] How often do you change the time on your computer?
[714.30 → 722.66] In the age of, you've got, it knows the location and automatically adjusts your time zone, your time and everything, because obviously.
[722.86 → 724.70] I do find that to be kind of weird too.
[724.78 → 728.70] The amount of times that I have to uncheck and then recheck automatically set time zone to
[728.70 → 729.54] be like, hello.
[729.54 → 732.54] And then it wakes up and does it for me.
[732.66 → 733.46] It's like, okay, thanks.
[734.92 → 739.66] Eternal Griever says, this is actually something that's been grinding my gears recently, right?
[740.46 → 740.94] Okay.
[740.98 → 741.72] What else we got?
[742.84 → 747.72] App section is the most random assortment of settings, offline maps, video playback.
[748.26 → 752.06] The Windows 11 context menu, right-clicking now has show more options.
[752.34 → 756.02] You click it and 80% of the options are the same because it just goes to the old menu.
[756.12 → 757.32] Just show me all the options.
[757.32 → 762.52] I actually really, really hate that there are two clicks now to get to a lot of the right
[762.52 → 764.00] right click context menu stuff.
[764.18 → 765.40] You can do that like God mode thing.
[766.50 → 766.90] Okay.
[767.08 → 768.58] So I do think that's solvable.
[768.92 → 769.24] Okay.
[769.60 → 770.88] You can also remove it as well.
[770.96 → 772.30] I think we talked about that earlier in the week.
[772.42 → 772.50] Yeah.
[772.64 → 773.44] There are solutions here.
[773.44 → 774.30] I have that disabled on this computer.
[774.66 → 775.52] They're not default.
[775.96 → 776.82] So it's still annoying.
[776.96 → 777.24] Mm-hmm.
[777.42 → 778.36] But there are solutions.
[778.48 → 783.58] So that's a big part of the Tech Gripes video is we want to present solutions.
[783.58 → 788.78] And if the solution is here's a quick registry, you know, D word that you can reconfigure,
[788.86 → 789.52] then that's great.
[790.18 → 795.90] Or if the solution is, hey, if you could just add like three lines of code.
[796.78 → 797.62] Hello, anyone?
[797.84 → 801.74] This is not going to make it into the video because no one cares because no one uses Peria
[801.74 → 802.10] phones.
[802.10 → 808.64] But I saw a post recently asking why none of the big tech YouTubers review Peria phones.
[808.70 → 809.88] And the answer is because no one cares.
[809.98 → 813.60] They're super expensive and limited availability outside of Japan in certain regions.
[814.16 → 820.82] But for me, I can tell you the reason that I don't daily one is that even now, after
[820.82 → 828.40] all these years, all these years, Sony still hasn't added like the three lines of code that
[828.40 → 833.96] it would take to swap the back button and the task switcher button or whatever the square
[833.96 → 834.58] one is called.
[835.10 → 836.94] I prefer the back button on the right.
[837.64 → 839.38] I have homunculus hands.
[839.92 → 840.82] I am right-handed.
[841.12 → 844.10] I cannot reach back all the way across on the left.
[844.40 → 845.90] I use back a lot.
[846.44 → 847.34] You might say...
[847.34 → 848.00] Everyone's going to.
[848.08 → 849.14] I like back.
[850.04 → 851.42] I'm a back enthusiast.
[851.76 → 852.10] Okay?
[852.52 → 853.16] I like it.
[853.58 → 854.94] I like to be able to reach it.
[854.94 → 856.36] I like to be able to get my thumb...
[856.36 → 856.76] Wait, okay.
[856.76 → 859.88] The point is just that I need that button a lot.
[860.26 → 863.58] And if it's over on the other side, it's really hard for me to reach.
[864.74 → 866.04] I could reach around.
[868.94 → 869.42] Sorry.
[869.56 → 870.56] Let's just continue.
[871.30 → 872.14] That works.
[872.28 → 881.78] If anyone from Sony is watching and didn't get totally bothered by all of that, I will
[881.78 → 883.16] immediately...
[883.16 → 884.54] I want the headphone jack.
[884.72 → 886.64] I want the taller form factor.
[886.76 → 886.96] Yeah.
[887.10 → 888.58] I want the gorgeous display.
[888.78 → 889.76] I want the camera.
[889.94 → 892.30] I want everything that is perfect about the Peria.
[892.46 → 893.92] Just allow me to swap it.
[894.02 → 895.04] Just let me move the buttons.
[895.06 → 896.18] You don't even have to do it by default.
[896.40 → 897.02] Just let me move the buttons.
[897.02 → 900.28] Just let me get the Hong Kong one, and we can root it and just switch it over.
[900.82 → 901.14] Thomas.
[901.26 → 901.60] Or Sita.
[902.06 → 904.62] Thomas says they're never going to do it.
[904.68 → 904.82] Yeah.
[904.94 → 905.64] I know.
[905.76 → 906.12] I know.
[906.38 → 906.78] I know.
[907.14 → 908.60] But they're never going to do it.
[908.60 → 912.78] Oh, man.
[912.78 → 913.10] Yeah.
[913.10 → 914.50] I think centre start menu.
[914.58 → 916.08] That's more of just like a design thing.
[916.16 → 916.28] Sorry.
[916.32 → 917.90] I'm just going through some of the stuff in my dock.
[918.34 → 919.12] We've got...
[919.12 → 919.46] Oh, man.
[919.50 → 920.30] This is amazing.
[920.74 → 921.76] Anyone here on macOS?
[922.10 → 924.10] Shout out if you're on macOS in the chat.
[924.42 → 924.68] Okay?
[924.82 → 925.44] Hit me up.
[925.44 → 930.04] Apple finally added window management with snapping.
[931.24 → 931.64] Finally.
[932.00 → 932.94] They didn't have snapping?
[933.12 → 933.34] No.
[933.74 → 936.36] You could get it with a third-party app for like $3 or something.
[936.62 → 936.76] Oh, okay.
[936.92 → 942.56] But it'll be a cold day in hell before I pay $3 for basic window management functionality
[942.56 → 944.76] that's been on Linux since I worked at NCI.
[945.06 → 946.46] Like, no.
[947.56 → 948.66] So they added.
[948.78 → 950.12] They added window snapping.
[951.34 → 952.96] But it has a border.
[952.96 → 955.70] For no apparent reason.
[955.82 → 958.80] Jake showed me this and my mind was blown.
[959.22 → 963.76] It has a border around it where you can see your desktop wallpaper.
[964.32 → 965.16] Wait, what?
[965.42 → 966.84] For no reason.
[967.00 → 967.48] Oh, no.
[967.56 → 968.84] That would bother me so much.
[968.84 → 970.90] For like no reason.
[971.16 → 971.96] I am...
[971.96 → 974.80] I thought you meant it was like framed like a photo.
[975.18 → 977.60] And I was like, that's weird, but it doesn't bother me that much.
[977.62 → 978.26] It's so weird.
[978.26 → 982.14] Being able to see the desktop background would constantly make me think that it's not actually there.
[982.14 → 983.54] You can turn it off.
[983.64 → 984.00] Okay.
[984.12 → 985.08] You can turn it off.
[985.22 → 985.48] Okay.
[985.48 → 993.90] But the fact that that is the default behaviour that they show the user is absolutely mind-blowing to me.
[994.06 → 994.78] That's so annoying.
[994.86 → 995.82] This next one.
[996.86 → 997.32] Oh, no.
[997.34 → 997.84] This is great.
[998.28 → 1004.86] On Macs that have the gaping wound in their display.
[1005.28 → 1006.32] The island.
[1006.64 → 1007.06] Sorry.
[1007.06 → 1009.30] Oh, dude.
[1009.50 → 1010.86] Sounds so much more metal.
[1011.06 → 1011.26] Dude.
[1011.46 → 1012.18] The gaping wound.
[1012.30 → 1012.88] I was...
[1012.88 → 1013.24] Oh, sorry.
[1013.34 → 1013.72] Wrong phone.
[1013.88 → 1014.28] Where's my...
[1014.28 → 1014.72] Oh, right.
[1015.38 → 1016.94] I put it away because it was buzzing the mic.
[1017.06 → 1017.74] First one prompts.
[1017.84 → 1021.34] On my iPhone, I was looking at some meme.
[1021.82 → 1027.20] Like one of those like four pictures from Lord of the Rings with captions style memes.
[1027.20 → 1032.70] And I literally couldn't read the top one because of the stupid island thing.
[1032.82 → 1034.40] And then I was watching...
[1034.40 → 1035.60] I was watching a movie.
[1035.60 → 1036.12] Like tug it down.
[1036.34 → 1037.82] I was watching a movie on my phone.
[1038.52 → 1043.26] And my choices were basically because Plex is not perfect.
[1043.38 → 1044.54] Not a perfect application.
[1044.94 → 1047.92] I either had like giant black bars around everything.
[1048.46 → 1051.06] Or I had a hole in the movie.
[1051.16 → 1053.20] And I was like, I can't.
[1053.20 → 1056.62] I actually cannot watch a movie with a hole in it.
[1056.72 → 1058.04] That's impossible.
[1058.48 → 1062.92] Like I'm not going to be one of these pretentious Hollywood directors that's like...
[1062.92 → 1064.62] My movie is mastered for the theatre.
[1064.62 → 1071.48] Well, if it's not watched in the theatre, then I'm afraid it simply cannot be enjoyed by your primitive eyes.
[1071.72 → 1073.24] I'm not like that about it.
[1073.28 → 1074.54] But you put a hole in the screen.
[1074.60 → 1075.38] Are you kidding me?
[1075.90 → 1076.20] Like that.
[1076.28 → 1077.36] I have lines.
[1077.46 → 1078.34] I have standards.
[1079.82 → 1080.26] Anyway.
[1080.26 → 1086.92] So on Macs that have the island, you can like full screen.
[1087.12 → 1088.22] Like Mac full screen.
[1088.46 → 1090.56] Like distraction free mode or whatever.
[1091.08 → 1093.58] But your task bar goes away at the top.
[1094.38 → 1096.40] Only for it to be filled with black pixels.
[1097.66 → 1100.80] Because they have to have a border for the entire top.
[1100.90 → 1102.40] Because of the stupid hole in the screen.
[1102.52 → 1104.12] Because there might be content there.
[1104.84 → 1105.54] Hilarious.
[1105.64 → 1108.02] I don't know if that's one that will make it to our gripes.
[1108.02 → 1112.78] Because nothing could really be done about that other than make better hardware in the first place.
[1113.54 → 1114.32] This is a good one.
[1114.36 → 1115.76] This was almost an entire video.
[1116.36 → 1118.52] And maybe it still could be at some point.
[1118.60 → 1122.48] Just like diagnosing computer sleep issues.
[1123.20 → 1125.56] Like sleep, wake, screen turning off issues.
[1125.92 → 1127.20] So I was having a problem.
[1127.34 → 1129.20] When we set up the LAN centre in the basement.
[1129.20 → 1132.32] I had five identical machines.
[1132.76 → 1134.82] With five identical monitors.
[1135.16 → 1137.66] With five identical sets of peripherals.
[1137.86 → 1142.96] And I couldn't figure out why half of them were going to sleep properly.
[1143.22 → 1144.58] And half of them weren't.
[1144.92 → 1145.68] That's annoying.
[1145.80 → 1146.66] You know what it was.
[1147.82 → 1148.80] Yes, technically.
[1149.36 → 1150.40] But no.
[1150.62 → 1150.92] Yes.
[1151.02 → 1152.10] Please enlighten me.
[1152.10 → 1154.46] Thank you for not ruining my setup.
[1154.78 → 1155.80] For once!
[1156.64 → 1157.34] I appreciate...
[1157.34 → 1159.36] Luke, I appreciate you.
[1159.38 → 1159.94] Thanks, man.
[1161.20 → 1163.10] So I almost made a whole video on this.
[1163.32 → 1168.12] So that we could, just as a springboard, to talk about how to diagnose these issues.
[1168.36 → 1174.50] But what it ultimately was, was I got into the administrator level command prompt and power config.
[1175.08 → 1176.02] It was Steam.
[1177.22 → 1179.42] But it was specifically...
[1179.42 → 1181.66] Because I had Steam open on all of them.
[1182.10 → 1190.36] And what I found out was that Steam will not let your computer go to sleep if you are open to the store tab.
[1190.84 → 1193.26] Even if Steam is minimized.
[1193.52 → 1194.24] So you had...
[1194.24 → 1195.90] So the ones that were sleeping were on library?
[1196.02 → 1200.08] Because I read that, and I was thinking, like, I always have Steam on, like, all my computers.
[1200.30 → 1201.56] On your library, probably.
[1201.78 → 1202.84] But it's probably on library.
[1202.90 → 1203.84] It's probably on library.
[1204.20 → 1205.00] So the reason...
[1205.00 → 1205.76] It's a good reason.
[1205.76 → 1211.72] The reason is that it's something to do with video playback on the store page.
[1211.86 → 1215.08] And how if you're playing back video, your computer doesn't go to sleep.
[1215.08 → 1221.86] So if there's any video playback or a video player that is open, the system won't sleep.
[1221.96 → 1225.30] It blew my flipping mind.
[1226.00 → 1226.62] Blew my mind.
[1227.24 → 1227.92] Or sorry, not sleep.
[1228.06 → 1228.40] Display.
[1228.56 → 1229.58] Display unwaking.
[1230.06 → 1230.90] Maybe it'll still sleep.
[1231.18 → 1231.38] Sorry.
[1231.56 → 1231.70] Sorry.
[1231.98 → 1234.92] But specifically what I was working on was my displays wouldn't blank.
[1235.32 → 1236.24] So I was thinking, like, it's...
[1236.24 → 1237.60] To have never been...
[1237.60 → 1238.82] Because my computer always goes to sleep.
[1239.08 → 1239.24] Yeah.
[1239.24 → 1244.34] This current iteration of my computer has no sleep problems.
[1244.46 → 1245.04] It's very nice.
[1245.10 → 1245.52] Oh, that's nice.
[1245.58 → 1247.94] I'm used to having some weird sleep issue.
[1248.60 → 1248.80] Yeah.
[1249.00 → 1256.32] So if there's anyone here that is like, oh my god, sometimes my display doesn't turn off.
[1256.44 → 1257.10] Yeah, that's cool.
[1257.30 → 1258.46] I bet you it's that.
[1258.56 → 1262.16] Because if you think about it, the Steam store page is just a browser.
[1262.36 → 1262.52] Yep.
[1263.42 → 1268.12] And any ad for any game or whatever is just a video.
[1268.12 → 1273.36] If you have a video open in your browser, even if it's in the background, your screen's
[1273.36 → 1274.22] not going to turn off.
[1274.34 → 1280.44] I wonder how much bandwidth just leaving the Steam store page up on your screen for like
[1280.44 → 1281.16] a week takes.
[1281.30 → 1281.86] I have no idea.
[1283.32 → 1285.28] Because it's a pretty solid amount of video, actually.
[1286.14 → 1288.48] It's probably very, like, low res, but still.
[1288.66 → 1293.66] But yeah, I was thinking of making that entire video just as an excuse to talk about sleep
[1293.66 → 1295.78] and screen timers and all that kind of stuff.
[1295.78 → 1298.70] But then we just kind of never got around to it, and we didn't have a great title for
[1298.70 → 1298.88] it.
[1300.28 → 1301.56] Anywho, smart TVs.
[1302.12 → 1304.52] LG lets you go offline and not get ads.
[1304.88 → 1307.32] But if you want to use an app, it asks you to update.
[1308.24 → 1310.94] You can use the app, but have to navigate around the prompt.
[1311.14 → 1312.46] You must log in to update.
[1312.94 → 1315.20] And then our second one is the entirety of Wizen OS.
[1315.32 → 1316.18] I think that's too broad.
[1316.24 → 1317.24] I think that's too broad, Adam.
[1317.26 → 1318.26] I don't think we're going to do that one.
[1318.32 → 1320.34] There's supposed to be nitpicks.
[1320.34 → 1324.38] I feel like Adam has a TV with Wizen OS.
[1325.42 → 1325.82] Monitors.
[1326.16 → 1326.54] I'm just personally bothered.
[1327.08 → 1330.64] Why do certain presets lock me out of certain features without any rhyme or reason?
[1330.80 → 1333.84] Actually, Adam, I can probably, I can explain some of that at least.
[1334.50 → 1338.92] There are certainly ones where it's like, no, I don't get that at all.
[1339.04 → 1342.88] But like filmmaker mode, for instance, will lock you out of a lot of the TV settings because
[1342.88 → 1346.52] it wouldn't be filmmaker mode if you were allowed to change a bunch of stuff.
[1346.52 → 1352.66] However, most TVs in filmmaker mode will allow you to set the white point.
[1353.34 → 1357.16] Some of them will lock you in warm because that is like a filmmaker.
[1357.34 → 1359.30] I do not like the warm preset.
[1359.46 → 1362.90] I prefer 6500 Kelvin and don't touch my white point.
[1364.38 → 1367.82] But anyway, the point is that some of them do make sense.
[1367.94 → 1369.26] Some of them absolutely don't.
[1369.70 → 1374.60] If there was one that we were going to, if there was one that we were going to rant about
[1374.60 → 1378.58] when it comes to monitor settings, then I would say it's the one where you're not allowed
[1378.58 → 1380.78] to change any settings if you don't have an active input.
[1383.02 → 1383.84] Yeah, why not?
[1384.28 → 1385.14] Old monitors.
[1385.46 → 1386.16] You totally could.
[1386.32 → 1390.46] Used to let you have them on and play around with all their settings and everything.
[1390.84 → 1391.06] Yeah.
[1391.50 → 1397.78] Whereas now, you can't tell sometimes if your computer is broken and not outputting,
[1397.94 → 1400.40] or if your monitor is not on and not receiving a signal.
[1400.40 → 1404.42] It drives me absolutely crazy.
[1404.60 → 1408.28] I didn't know that was an issue, but I have used that to try to diagnose if my computer
[1408.28 → 1410.28] is properly sending out display or anything.
[1410.28 → 1411.68] Drives me flipping crazy.
[1411.68 → 1412.42] So that's really annoying.
[1414.20 → 1416.08] Bel trick says, well, the settings are tied to signal type.
[1416.16 → 1417.40] There are plenty that aren't.
[1418.74 → 1419.14] Yeah.
[1419.24 → 1421.84] And I just want it to be on, so I know it's on.
[1422.06 → 1426.46] So that I know what input it's on and that it's looking for signal.
[1426.56 → 1427.28] Give me something.
[1427.70 → 1428.40] Give me something.
[1428.40 → 1429.12] Give me something.
[1432.70 → 1433.14] Okay.
[1433.74 → 1435.02] We've got a lot of Teams ones.
[1435.14 → 1436.80] I feel like I'm hesitating.
[1436.90 → 1439.82] I could add so many more, but I feel like it would just take up.
[1439.92 → 1440.68] It would be a whole video.
[1440.98 → 1441.22] So like.
[1441.36 → 1444.72] One of these is notifications steal input focus for some reason.
[1445.10 → 1447.34] Teams notifications have gotten me killed in deadlock.
[1447.56 → 1450.18] Don't ask me why I'm on Teams and playing deadlock.
[1451.46 → 1454.66] Teams notification is separate from Windows integrated pop-ups.
[1454.76 → 1457.56] That's actually super annoying, especially because they're in the same place.
[1457.56 → 1457.88] Yeah.
[1458.30 → 1459.36] Come on, Microsoft.
[1459.64 → 1461.32] You literally make this software.
[1463.22 → 1467.92] Why can't I schedule a message to a group chat that I haven't messaged before?
[1468.38 → 1474.28] So if you have like a shoot in the morning or something like that, and you put together everyone that's on that shoot, and you just want to like schedule.
[1474.46 → 1476.90] So you just can't because I don't know whatever.
[1476.90 → 1478.24] It wants me to keep going.
[1478.38 → 1480.86] I can send a bunch of stuff later.
[1481.44 → 1485.32] I mean, I've ranted about this on the WAN show before, and I think people are a little tired of it.
[1485.68 → 1487.10] So I don't want to go through way too many of it.
[1487.22 → 1493.94] But like my the main two that frustrate me is that I can't schedule a message to a group chat that I haven't sent a message to before.
[1494.30 → 1494.40] Yeah.
[1494.52 → 1496.44] Adam added and this is super annoying.
[1496.44 → 1498.38] Why can't I schedule a reply to a thread?
[1499.44 → 1510.20] Just like and I understand some of the theory of not being able to schedule a reply to a thread because I think they're worried that like other things will be sent before that one.
[1510.34 → 1510.82] I could see that.
[1510.96 → 1516.42] My team's general like etiquette for this is just put scheduled in brackets.
[1516.42 → 1518.50] This is super normal.
[1518.64 → 1519.44] Everyone does this.
[1519.46 → 1520.26] We're not big brain.
[1520.42 → 1520.78] Solvable.
[1521.02 → 1522.44] This is extremely solvable.
[1522.68 → 1524.38] Stop like not allowing us to.
[1524.52 → 1525.52] Okay, I'm going to relax.
[1526.60 → 1532.72] The other primary annoying thing that I have is the amount of times that I'm in team's calls and people go, is my mic working?
[1532.86 → 1534.76] Because they can't see it light up.
[1535.02 → 1535.22] Yeah.
[1535.80 → 1536.02] Just.
[1536.50 → 1537.18] Whoa, the spider.
[1537.68 → 1538.44] Oh, he was there.
[1539.04 → 1539.80] Is he in my headphones?
[1541.78 → 1542.60] He might be.
[1543.02 → 1544.20] He's a crafty little guy.
[1544.20 → 1544.62] I saw him.
[1544.62 → 1549.50] For people that weren't part of the pre-show, there was a spider that climbed up onto the desk and went directly.
[1551.98 → 1557.30] There was a spider that crawled up onto the desk and went directly into one of my USB ports and hid under the little USB finger.
[1557.78 → 1564.32] And then he took off like I think it was like a minute into the show and maybe went into Linus's headphones.
[1564.68 → 1570.30] I would strongly prefer to not put these headphones on if there could be a spider inside them.
[1570.50 → 1570.86] Yeah.
[1571.66 → 1573.52] Definitely small enough to crawl into your ear.
[1573.92 → 1574.28] Yeah.
[1574.62 → 1575.18] Okay.
[1576.56 → 1579.56] Now I'm really creeped out right now.
[1579.64 → 1581.08] If there's a spider in my headphones.
[1581.08 → 1581.74] I don't mind checking them out for you.
[1582.48 → 1586.80] I would be super, super unhappy.
[1587.00 → 1592.32] Words could not describe the level of unhappy that I would be if a spider like crawled across my face.
[1592.90 → 1594.18] I'll add another one too.
[1594.30 → 1595.70] Dude, I know it's not poisonous.
[1595.92 → 1596.86] I don't care.
[1597.00 → 1598.12] I do not like it.
[1598.12 → 1599.08] It's not the poison part.
[1599.18 → 1601.22] It's the digging into your ear part.
[1601.54 → 1601.78] Anyway.
[1602.58 → 1603.66] It's not even that.
[1603.74 → 1604.58] I just...
[1604.58 → 1606.70] I don't need a reason to not like spiders.
[1606.90 → 1607.32] That's fair.
[1607.32 → 1613.62] From an evolutionary standpoint, a fear of spiders and snakes and like dead things and all the stuff that I kind of phobia.
[1614.04 → 1614.22] Yeah.
[1614.32 → 1616.20] Is what kept my ancestors alive.
[1616.26 → 1616.44] Why?
[1616.44 → 1621.56] And damn it, I'm going to uphold their legacy here and continue to be afraid of those things, however irrational it might be.
[1621.56 → 1627.14] They're all watching down on you, not wanting to put your headphones on and cheering the glass.
[1627.48 → 1628.02] Being like, yeah.
[1628.18 → 1628.90] No, I'm okay.
[1629.04 → 1630.10] I have thoroughly searched them.
[1630.18 → 1633.08] Dan was going to bring me new headphones, but it's okay, Dan.
[1633.72 → 1634.38] I'm ready.
[1635.74 → 1636.32] I'm ready.
[1636.50 → 1645.68] The last thing I'll say about Teams is if I'm in Slack and I attach something to a chat message or even just attach something in general, I can just press send right away before it finishes attaching.
[1645.94 → 1646.16] Yeah.
[1646.24 → 1648.72] And the message will just send when it's done attaching.
[1648.72 → 1649.00] Yeah.
[1649.00 → 1652.36] You try to do that in Teams and I don't remember, it like opens it or something.
[1653.04 → 1656.46] It does, whatever it does, it's annoying and it doesn't send it.
[1657.22 → 1657.58] That's all.
[1657.64 → 1659.76] So I have to sit there and just wait for it to attach.
[1659.80 → 1661.54] And if it's like a video, it might take a little bit.
[1661.70 → 1666.90] Dude, I've never, I've never really used iMessage because no one that I know uses iMessage.
[1667.00 → 1667.88] So why would I?
[1668.14 → 1668.26] Yep.
[1669.04 → 1671.30] But man, the reply function is awful.
[1671.78 → 1672.04] Oh.
[1672.70 → 1678.20] Like you, like you, when you, when you hold on something to like reply to a specific message, you know,
[1678.20 → 1686.04] or you don't use WhatsApp, but you know how it works in any sensible program where it just gives you like a preview of the original message and then just has it indented and like has the reply to it.
[1686.04 → 1686.22] Yeah.
[1686.22 → 1688.48] It creates this like new pop-up window.
[1688.84 → 1689.06] Oh.
[1689.06 → 1695.68] And then like getting out of it is like, like, like you have to like click somewhere else entirely on the screen.
[1695.78 → 1699.20] And it kind of has like these like reply threads within the thing.
[1699.30 → 1701.12] It's ridiculous.
[1701.32 → 1705.30] I was like, how did a trillion-dollar company design this?
[1705.34 → 1706.58] I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.
[1706.82 → 1707.90] That seems not awesome.
[1707.90 → 1714.66] Um, yeah, I, I never used it during my, during my time with the iPhone, but it was something that I encountered like just the other day.
[1714.66 → 1719.70] Because I was chatting with, um, John from Esther, um, about some Hexes thing.
[1719.70 → 1723.10] And I had, I had to reply to something specific because we kind of had two threads going.
[1723.18 → 1728.24] We were like talking about Christmas plans and also talking about like future Hexes plans.
[1728.24 → 1732.30] And you know, you know how those things could get a little bit confusing, right?
[1732.38 → 1735.48] Because he could be like, you know, oh, I had a close relative die.
[1735.58 → 1737.28] So this will be our first Christmas without them.
[1737.60 → 1741.28] Also, we've got this great feature plan and I could be like, wow, that's so cool.
[1742.02 → 1743.50] Which one was I replying to?
[1743.94 → 1744.70] Who knows?
[1744.86 → 1744.94] Yeah.
[1745.04 → 1746.28] Reply, reply threads are good.
[1746.58 → 1746.80] Yeah.
[1746.86 → 1747.58] Reply threads are good.
[1747.64 → 1749.48] Anyway, the point is, yeah, it's, it's off.
[1749.62 → 1749.74] Yeah.
[1749.74 → 1752.06] We've got a couple of people backing me up in chat here.
[1752.06 → 1754.02] So apparently this isn't just me being crazy.
[1754.62 → 1758.22] Um, I think we could actually, Adam, who's obviously watching the show right now.
[1758.40 → 1762.90] I think we could even steal some of the stuff from the, uh, the iOS time video.
[1764.06 → 1767.12] Uh, oh dude, YouTube music.
[1767.50 → 1769.12] Don't get me started on YouTube music.
[1769.20 → 1769.38] Okay.
[1769.44 → 1770.14] Adam, here's one.
[1770.18 → 1771.18] You probably don't know.
[1771.60 → 1778.12] Um, if you, if you have your main Google account on your phone for some reason as a different
[1778.12 → 1783.52] account from the one that has a premium subscription and has YouTube music, you will not be able
[1783.52 → 1784.22] anymore.
[1784.34 → 1787.90] It used to work, but you can, this is what ultimately made me switch.
[1787.90 → 1793.38] From my like G suite account as my main account on this device to my like personal random
[1793.38 → 1799.76] Gmail that I don't even really use other than to have YouTube premium on, um, you in
[1799.76 → 1805.40] with Android auto, you can't use voice control to play a specific song on YouTube music unless
[1805.40 → 1811.14] your Google account, like your main one that you're like mainly signed in to the phone with
[1811.14 → 1812.58] is the one that has premium.
[1812.96 → 1816.34] So just like having another one, you can't select which account you have.
[1816.88 → 1819.56] And, and, oh, oh, it's so annoying.
[1819.78 → 1825.32] I really wish like, I think this would be a pretty cool feature is if you could like claim
[1825.32 → 1828.14] your like network of Google accounts basically.
[1828.14 → 1835.04] So if like I could have a personal Google account and then branch under it, like, okay, this
[1835.04 → 1836.02] is my personal account.
[1836.12 → 1837.10] This is my work account.
[1837.18 → 1838.80] This is my whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1839.48 → 1844.82] Um, and then I, if I buy premium, I wanted to give it to all of them.
[1844.88 → 1845.94] I don't want to see YouTube ads.
[1846.08 → 1850.78] I don't want to open a YouTube, uh, YouTube video that I need to watch for work in my work
[1850.78 → 1851.90] browser thing.
[1851.90 → 1857.26] And then get an ad and go, oh, and copy the URL and bring it over to my personal browser.
[1857.38 → 1857.72] Watch it.
[1857.78 → 1857.94] Okay.
[1857.94 → 1858.58] Watch it there.
[1858.66 → 1860.00] And it's the same with YouTube music.
[1860.00 → 1862.12] That was actually what Adam was talking about.
[1862.18 → 1862.46] Yeah.
[1862.56 → 1867.70] Uh, how if he's a YouTube music and YouTube must be logged into the same account on the
[1867.70 → 1870.58] browser, you can't be like, yeah, I have music here and I have this there.
[1871.02 → 1872.34] Oh, so annoying.
[1872.34 → 1875.82] So you have to open YouTube music and edge so he can be logged into two separate accounts.
[1876.28 → 1881.14] Um, you can also use, I think, um, brave has perfect support for multi Google accounts
[1881.14 → 1885.06] across, uh, different things where you can use incognito mode.
[1885.14 → 1885.80] There are other options.
[1886.04 → 1887.90] Technically most of them do like even, even Firefox does.
[1888.00 → 1890.60] Firefox is, is just clunky compared to Chrome's.
[1890.66 → 1895.92] Chrome has perfect and easy to use multi account stuff.
[1896.44 → 1899.40] Um, like profiles and Firefox has them as well.
[1899.40 → 1901.18] It's just not as clean.
[1902.26 → 1903.94] Um, people are saying it's great.
[1904.04 → 1905.82] Maybe I just wasn't good at it.
[1905.86 → 1906.10] I don't know.
[1906.26 → 1906.42] Dude.
[1906.50 → 1908.38] I just, other people are saying it's clunky.
[1908.52 → 1908.92] I don't know.
[1909.00 → 1909.54] It is what it is.
[1909.54 → 1913.08] I wouldn't care about anything to do with YouTube music.
[1913.16 → 1919.22] I would accept everything that's kind of crappy about YouTube music in a heartbeat if they brought
[1919.22 → 1922.50] back quick, painless casting to my Sonos stuff.
[1922.78 → 1927.18] But ever since Google and Sonos got at it, that's gone.
[1927.18 → 1929.08] It was perfect in Google play music.
[1929.20 → 1933.46] It was literally perfect on the, on the player page.
[1933.58 → 1936.30] There was a cast button, like how a cast button works.
[1936.30 → 1939.88] And then it would just bring up the pop-up for what you want to cast to.
[1939.96 → 1942.16] And you would go this one, this one, this one, and this one.
[1942.24 → 1943.12] And press go.
[1943.70 → 1944.38] And it would just.
[1945.08 → 1946.34] Oh my gosh.
[1947.04 → 1948.36] This is incredibly annoying.
[1948.46 → 1949.16] And then it would just go.
[1949.22 → 1949.72] I need to stop.
[1949.72 → 1953.18] I need to stop using this phone, but that's, oh, it's so tedious switching phones.
[1954.14 → 1955.34] Mine's below the table.
[1957.86 → 1959.98] Well, it was happening when it was above the table too.
[1959.98 → 1962.74] I'm just going to put it under my thick, juicy thighs.
[1963.02 → 1963.46] Nice.
[1963.54 → 1964.44] That should block it.
[1966.46 → 1967.20] Thanks, Taylor.
[1967.26 → 1968.72] It immediately stopped.
[1970.06 → 1971.18] It's a lot of water.
[1971.76 → 1972.72] What can I say?
[1974.92 → 1976.26] Like, no joke.
[1976.50 → 1979.32] The second he put his leg back down, it was over.
[1982.72 → 1983.12] Anyway.
[1986.18 → 1989.24] Dude, I've been hitting the Stair master lately in the rolling machine.
[1989.24 → 1989.80] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1989.80 → 1990.06] Dude.
[1990.92 → 1992.42] These thighs are getting firm.
[1992.62 → 1992.80] Yeah.
[1992.92 → 1994.28] They're getting to be firm thighs.
[1994.50 → 1994.64] Yeah, yeah.
[1994.68 → 1994.86] Yeah.
[1994.96 → 1996.78] I actually, like, go to the gym now.
[1996.88 → 2000.04] He's never going to get me to lift anything because it's just like.
[2000.42 → 2001.00] You lifted things?
[2001.12 → 2001.38] It's not.
[2001.50 → 2002.14] What did I lift?
[2002.18 → 2002.56] Your body.
[2003.48 → 2003.94] On what?
[2004.30 → 2004.82] The Stair master.
[2005.28 → 2006.28] Oh, I mean, yeah, sure.
[2006.80 → 2007.56] Oh, dude.
[2008.28 → 2009.52] Stair master's a real.
[2009.72 → 2011.46] I've never been on a Stair master before.
[2011.46 → 2012.46] Stair master's a real.
[2012.68 → 2014.28] That's a real workout, man.
[2015.08 → 2015.44] Dude.
[2015.44 → 2015.56] Dude.
[2016.90 → 2021.82] Like, I've been meaning to send you, like, pictures of what the machine looks like when
[2021.82 → 2022.80] I'm done one time.
[2023.66 → 2025.44] Like, dude.
[2025.70 → 2026.04] I'm in there.
[2026.08 → 2027.82] I'll do, like, half an hour of cardio.
[2028.54 → 2034.58] And I can't do one thing, like, at the like, go hard, like, level that I want to do it
[2034.58 → 2036.14] for the full 30 minutes that I like to do.
[2036.18 → 2039.92] But you know my thing where I like to do 30 minutes of cardio, like, every Danish.
[2040.24 → 2042.44] I try to do every day, but it doesn't happen every day.
[2042.44 → 2042.62] That's pretty sick.
[2042.62 → 2047.88] So the thing that I've been, so the thing I did the other day was I hit the, uh, the
[2047.88 → 2051.18] rowing machine for 10 minutes, then the...
[2051.18 → 2052.28] Is this at the Smash Gym?
[2052.34 → 2052.46] Yeah.
[2052.52 → 2053.56] Then the bike for five.
[2053.62 → 2054.70] Do they have the cleaning stuff yet?
[2054.76 → 2054.90] Yeah.
[2055.14 → 2055.38] Okay.
[2055.50 → 2059.94] Then the Stair master for 10, and then finished off with another five on the bike.
[2059.94 → 2065.84] So in 30 minutes, the 40-ounce bottle, I had drained two of them.
[2066.26 → 2067.98] To give you some idea.
[2071.86 → 2072.34] Insane.
[2073.28 → 2074.18] Yeah, that's nuts.
[2074.30 → 2077.36] I, I'll, I'll go to the gym, and I, I tend to go for, like, a while.
[2077.54 → 2082.62] Like, I, for whatever reason, I'm not really into, like, the when I'm doing weights, I'm
[2082.62 → 2084.30] not really into, like, the 30-minute workout.
[2084.46 → 2086.48] I'm, like, going for, like, quite a, quite a bit of time.
[2086.96 → 2090.20] Um, and there'll be, like, there'll be some chick on the Stair master when I walk in.
[2090.42 → 2092.64] She's, like, not moving that fast, but she's on the Stair master.
[2092.84 → 2096.86] I'm noticing, like, I'm close to wrapping up my workout, like, an hour and a half later,
[2097.00 → 2099.86] and I'm walking by, and I'm, like, she's still on there.
[2100.16 → 2101.96] Like, what the hell?
[2102.74 → 2103.74] Oh, my God.
[2103.92 → 2105.22] Like, I would fall over.
[2105.36 → 2107.34] There's no, there's no possible way.
[2107.58 → 2108.68] It would not happen.
[2108.74 → 2111.78] I could do it at a low pace for a long time.
[2112.22 → 2115.74] But, um, I, I don't know what the settings are.
[2115.74 → 2117.02] It's probably, like, two hours.
[2117.20 → 2121.70] I don't know what the settings are equivalent to, but, um, I'm trying to think, like, what's
[2121.70 → 2123.80] the what's the what's the pace that it's at?
[2123.96 → 2127.78] I'll have to check sometime, but it's, it's at 16, whatever that is.
[2128.52 → 2130.24] That's going to be machine-dependent.
[2130.48 → 2130.50] Yeah.
[2130.50 → 2130.80] Yeah.
[2130.80 → 2131.00] Yeah.
[2131.00 → 2134.56] So, I, I forget how many stairs per minute it is, but it's, oh, dude, it's a lot.
[2135.56 → 2136.26] It's painful.
[2136.48 → 2137.64] It, it hurts a lot.
[2138.00 → 2139.16] Uh, okay, what else we got here?
[2139.32 → 2142.70] Someone said, I would like to hear more about Luke's fitness habits as a fellow lifter.
[2142.92 → 2145.72] I'm trying to get a flow plane exclusive.
[2145.84 → 2146.56] Oh, yeah, that would be cool.
[2146.56 → 2149.60] Where we get a bunch of, not me, but a bunch of different of the people.
[2149.70 → 2149.90] Yeah.
[2150.00 → 2150.76] Including myself.
[2151.06 → 2155.08] Uh, but a bunch of different people at the company that, that like to gym often, uh,
[2155.08 → 2157.36] to do, like, a round table discussion thing.
[2157.42 → 2158.34] We film it for flow plane.
[2158.46 → 2158.68] Cool.
[2158.80 → 2159.70] I think that'd be pretty sweet.
[2160.26 → 2160.56] Cool.
[2160.72 → 2161.92] None of it's, none of us are, like.
[2162.24 → 2162.84] I'll participate.
[2163.30 → 2163.86] Trainers or anything.
[2163.90 → 2164.24] That'd be cool.
[2164.34 → 2164.54] I don't.
[2164.86 → 2165.66] I, I, I, oh, wait.
[2165.74 → 2168.26] Well, does it count if it also includes, like, badminton stuff?
[2168.42 → 2168.92] I think so.
[2168.98 → 2169.30] I don't know.
[2169.42 → 2170.10] Like, can I just be like.
[2170.10 → 2172.62] To me, I think it's just, like, a fitness discussion, I think.
[2172.78 → 2173.50] Dude, I had a.
[2173.50 → 2174.28] I think it'd be neat.
[2174.84 → 2180.68] I, like, did not realize how hard I destroyed myself yesterday because I wasn't in the gym,
[2180.88 → 2181.04] gym.
[2181.30 → 2182.80] I was, I was playing badminton.
[2183.04 → 2186.84] But what I did was, uh, we played a format called box game.
[2187.36 → 2189.54] And, um, I was, don't worry, I was playing with my wife.
[2192.54 → 2193.30] My goodness.
[2193.68 → 2198.68] Anyway, uh, box game, um, makes the in front of the service line is out.
[2199.30 → 2201.56] And behind the double service line is out.
[2201.56 → 2204.10] So it's like a shortened court.
[2204.40 → 2206.28] And typically you play on a half court.
[2206.50 → 2210.68] So it's a little bit wider than half of a singles court because you use the doubles line.
[2210.82 → 2214.82] And you play directly across from each other, directly across from each other, or diagonally,
[2214.96 → 2215.54] or diagonally.
[2215.84 → 2220.52] But I'm playing a format with Yvonne to help even things out because I'm a bit of a stronger
[2220.52 → 2221.12] player than her.
[2221.44 → 2225.10] Um, where she takes half a court, right?
[2225.24 → 2226.48] Half a, half a box.
[2226.62 → 2230.58] And I take a box that is the entire width of the singles court on the other side.
[2230.58 → 2236.42] So I put on a 20 pound weight vest yesterday and I played that against her.
[2237.42 → 2242.98] We've got, dude, I could barely emerge from my bed this morning.
[2243.18 → 2244.94] I destroyed myself.
[2245.14 → 2249.06] I am in so much, I'm in so much pain today.
[2249.28 → 2252.26] Like it's, it's actually awful.
[2252.50 → 2256.00] There's, yeah, there's a certain level where it's like, okay, that might've been good,
[2256.10 → 2257.52] but it might not also be worth it.
[2257.52 → 2261.94] Well, it's hard because when I'm having fun, I don't, I don't realize, I don't notice.
[2262.12 → 2262.26] Yeah.
[2262.48 → 2267.90] I'll sometimes get in a zone where like I don't register the level of strain properly.
[2268.06 → 2272.62] And then like the next morning or that night, I'll be like, I'm exhausted.
[2272.78 → 2273.50] And then I'll be like, oh.
[2274.26 → 2274.40] Yeah.
[2274.50 → 2277.70] Radon man says pain is weakness leaving the body.
[2277.70 → 2283.28] No, sometimes it's just, sometimes it's just overdoing it.
[2286.28 → 2292.16] We've got one here that is, why can't I just plug a USB-A to a USB-A and transfer files between computers?
[2292.64 → 2294.52] There are a lot of security reasons for that.
[2294.58 → 2296.18] I don't think we'll include that one.
[2296.18 → 2300.76] I mean, there are some good points here.
[2300.84 → 2304.18] You can plug in a phone, which is just a portable computer and copy files from that.
[2304.40 → 2306.66] But, but also, I don't know.
[2306.78 → 2309.30] I'm sure there's, I'm sure there are reasons for that.
[2309.44 → 2310.48] I'm sure there are reasons for that.
[2310.92 → 2312.62] Google Gemini just in general.
[2312.90 → 2313.12] Okay.
[2313.14 → 2314.16] That's too broad, Adam.
[2314.20 → 2319.96] I don't know if we'll do that either, but Google Gemini replacing Google Assistant can't do 80% of assistant functions,
[2319.96 → 2321.72] but can hallucinate Google sheets.
[2321.72 → 2322.12] Yeah.
[2325.52 → 2331.64] And I can't, okay, I admittedly, I haven't dug too deep into this, but it switched to a default male voice.
[2332.06 → 2332.80] And I don't know.
[2332.84 → 2334.90] I just don't like my phone talking to me in a male voice.
[2335.22 → 2336.30] I don't like it.
[2336.64 → 2346.22] I had, I did this whole gambit like years and years ago where I set up a .co.uk email address to get like a specific voice.
[2346.36 → 2349.72] Oh, just to get like a British, like a sexy British lady voice.
[2349.72 → 2351.64] That wasn't really even the goal.
[2351.72 → 2352.62] I just thought it would be like neat.
[2354.06 → 2356.08] And then, yeah, it changed it.
[2356.94 → 2357.74] I was like, oh, that's annoying.
[2358.64 → 2360.24] I don't even, it doesn't really matter that much.
[2360.28 → 2361.04] It's just weird.
[2361.30 → 2361.68] I don't know.
[2362.30 → 2362.86] All right.
[2363.28 → 2365.42] Let's maybe jump into our second topic.
[2366.74 → 2368.10] No, we have to do a second topic.
[2368.16 → 2368.76] I'll do a quick one.
[2368.82 → 2369.16] Okay, Dan.
[2371.10 → 2371.86] My hero.
[2373.30 → 2373.98] Let's go.
[2375.02 → 2375.82] My hero.
[2376.06 → 2376.46] Yes.
[2376.46 → 2380.54] My guy, Terry, will be featured on Canada's $5 bill.
[2381.06 → 2382.74] Okay, this is not really tech related.
[2383.38 → 2384.34] But we have talked.
[2384.34 → 2384.76] Who cares?
[2384.86 → 2390.64] We have talked about the actual rightful king of Canada, Terry Fox, before on this show.
[2391.10 → 2392.80] He is a he's a Canadian hero.
[2392.80 → 2397.94] And the only reason he's only a Canadian hero is that most of the world doesn't know about him.
[2398.08 → 2400.26] If you don't know who Terry Fox is, go read about him.
[2400.48 → 2406.04] He's actually the coolest, wholesomest, awesome, most inspiring guy like ever.
[2406.04 → 2414.54] And he is finally, finally going to be in his rightful place on our money, damn it.
[2414.94 → 2416.90] So he's going to the $5 note.
[2417.42 → 2421.52] The process of replacing Wilfred Laurier began almost five years ago, apparently.
[2421.96 → 2426.80] And the Bank of Canada got more than 600 submissions to their open nominations for the honour.
[2427.58 → 2429.42] They made the right choice.
[2429.62 → 2429.74] Yeah.
[2429.74 → 2434.38] After losing part of his right leg to cancer, Terry embarked on his Marathon of Hope,
[2434.38 → 2439.36] an attempt to run across Canada on his prosthetic leg, raising money for cancer research.
[2440.18 → 2447.20] His run was tragically cut short in 1981, but he was still able to raise $24.7 million.
[2447.82 → 2452.02] That was a dollar for every person living in Canada at the time.
[2452.80 → 2455.84] Since his death, annual Terry Fox runs have been held all over the world
[2455.84 → 2460.46] and have raised another $800 million for cancer research.
[2460.56 → 2463.64] That's Canadian dollars, unfortunately, but still, it's a lot of money.
[2463.64 → 2466.96] Not a ton of amazing news coming out of Canada over the last little while.
[2467.14 → 2467.22] Yeah.
[2467.42 → 2468.20] This is cool.
[2468.30 → 2468.86] This is cool.
[2468.94 → 2472.90] We're finally doing it properly and putting Terry on the money.
[2473.08 → 2473.88] So that's good.
[2474.10 → 2474.34] Yeah.
[2474.68 → 2475.42] It's finally time.
[2475.96 → 2476.76] Okay, fine.
[2476.86 → 2478.04] We'll explain merch messages, Dan.
[2478.42 → 2480.42] Merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[2480.52 → 2481.96] You can have your merch message pop up there.
[2482.20 → 2483.08] You can have it go to...
[2483.08 → 2485.30] What the?
[2485.30 → 2491.24] You can have it go to producer Dan, who will reply to it.
[2492.46 → 2495.58] He might forward it to someone internal to better address your question,
[2495.72 → 2501.26] or he might curate it, and it will go to me and Luke to reply to you live on the show.
[2501.68 → 2505.00] Dan, do you want to show the fine people out there how it wakes?
[2505.34 → 2505.68] Sure.
[2506.00 → 2506.50] Hey, DLL.
[2506.62 → 2507.82] Question for Linus primarily.
[2507.82 → 2511.92] You've mentioned before that you like to see employee candidates' personal projects.
[2512.12 → 2513.68] What are some of the coolest projects you've seen?
[2515.14 → 2515.70] Oh, dude.
[2515.78 → 2518.62] I haven't been a job interviewer in like years and years.
[2518.98 → 2520.58] Luke's probably seen some cool stuff, though.
[2521.02 → 2522.20] Sean's home lab was sick.
[2524.40 → 2525.26] That was cool.
[2525.36 → 2525.50] Yeah.
[2525.66 → 2526.50] Our IT guy.
[2526.72 → 2526.88] Yeah.
[2527.72 → 2530.42] If I remember correctly, Nick Harris had some cool stuff.
[2530.86 → 2533.14] I remember someone showed me a cool Plex server at some point.
[2533.42 → 2533.56] Yeah.
[2533.56 → 2534.68] But they like cobbled together.
[2534.82 → 2536.18] It was like very Jacky.
[2536.38 → 2537.56] And I was like, nice.
[2537.96 → 2541.56] I've had a surprising amount of like software dev applicants that, you know,
[2541.60 → 2544.40] would just have nothing to do with anything to do with hardware here.
[2544.52 → 2546.96] Show me their like computers or servers or whatever.
[2547.12 → 2550.98] Just like, you know, I often get into those types of questions.
[2550.98 → 2552.16] Like what kind of stuff are you into?
[2552.26 → 2555.70] And then, you know, it'll naturally lead to showing into those things.
[2557.04 → 2559.36] I had some really cool software projects.
[2560.06 → 2564.08] The first, this was way too tough of a project.
[2564.26 → 2566.46] We've significantly toned it down since then.
[2566.56 → 2570.52] But the first developer hiring wave that we did for Float plane, do you remember this?
[2571.02 → 2571.60] The game?
[2571.94 → 2572.66] Make us a game?
[2573.10 → 2574.40] That was way too big of an ask.
[2574.44 → 2576.18] It was also way too open-ended.
[2576.44 → 2577.46] Yeah, we were new.
[2577.86 → 2581.42] We did not know quite what we were asking of people at the time.
[2581.42 → 2591.16] But the developer that did get hired and is still with us from that wave, we basically asked to make us a game.
[2591.32 → 2594.24] And then we listed like some things that would be cool for it to have.
[2594.98 → 2596.56] I don't remember the exact details.
[2596.76 → 2600.34] And they made what was essentially like PVP asteroids.
[2600.96 → 2602.04] And it had a chat.
[2602.36 → 2603.32] I remember that.
[2603.44 → 2603.98] That was sick.
[2604.18 → 2607.56] And he like to set up some notification things so he would be able to know when I connected to it.
[2607.56 → 2610.56] So when I jumped into it, it's supposed to be PVP asteroids.
[2610.92 → 2615.40] He also jumped on, and then we like fought against each other and were able to talk in the chat.
[2615.50 → 2617.52] And I was like, whoa.
[2618.68 → 2619.08] Okay.
[2619.90 → 2620.80] That's pretty cool.
[2620.88 → 2624.50] We have some people who work here who are like probably too good.
[2626.96 → 2627.86] What can I say?
[2627.86 → 2628.30] And I'm happy they're still here.
[2628.30 → 2628.72] What can I say?
[2628.82 → 2629.92] Luke's a great boss.
[2630.08 → 2630.46] Yeah.
[2631.28 → 2632.56] Thanks for sticking with me.
[2633.14 → 2633.82] Oh, man.
[2635.40 → 2636.66] But yeah, I don't know.
[2636.66 → 2637.22] Yeah.
[2637.28 → 2638.22] Someone's like, I want to play that now.
[2638.32 → 2640.44] It was genuinely entertaining.
[2640.80 → 2641.08] Oh, yeah.
[2641.64 → 2642.48] You showed it to me.
[2642.54 → 2642.94] I tried it.
[2643.00 → 2643.78] It was really fun.
[2643.88 → 2644.40] It was pretty sick.
[2644.48 → 2645.54] It was super fun.
[2647.52 → 2649.46] Hey, Rod piping up in the chat.
[2649.50 → 2651.28] He says some freaking amazing people.
[2651.68 → 2651.98] Heck yeah.
[2652.10 → 2658.26] Rod knows a lot more of the team than most average float plane viewers would because he's come up and hung out with us a few times.
[2658.64 → 2660.76] Rod, you're coming up for softball night this spring, right?
[2660.78 → 2661.88] I know it's a little early.
[2661.88 → 2666.02] It's December still, but you're going to come join us for at least one softball night, right?
[2666.44 → 2667.22] I want a commitment.
[2667.54 → 2668.84] I want a commitment today.
[2669.02 → 2669.72] I'll make it out.
[2669.84 → 2670.40] Let's see it.
[2670.58 → 2671.08] Yeah, you better.
[2671.18 → 2672.04] He says for sure.
[2672.12 → 2672.32] All right.
[2672.38 → 2672.98] Heck yeah, Rod.
[2673.10 → 2676.16] I still probably can't bat or throw properly, but I'll make it out.
[2676.28 → 2681.92] For those of you who don't know, Rod was on the BS Mods episode of Scrapyard Wars.
[2682.12 → 2688.46] He's an incredible PC fodder and has been a long time just sort of awesome supporter of the show.
[2688.68 → 2690.08] I didn't remember this.
[2690.08 → 2694.28] I don't know if it made it into the cut because I haven't finished watching the video yet, but we did.
[2694.28 → 2695.82] Is that me?
[2696.06 → 2696.50] No, it's you.
[2696.88 → 2699.48] We did Nick from Creator Warehouse.
[2699.58 → 2702.44] We did Nick Light's AMD Ultimate Tech upgrade recently.
[2702.86 → 2710.18] And he reminded me of the time that we had to get 7Gamers1 CPU to CES for a sponsor.
[2710.18 → 2718.24] And the only way for us to get it there safely was to drive it down to Bob and Rod BS Mods in Seattle.
[2718.46 → 2727.70] Nick took it down there, and then they took it down to CES for us because they were driving to Las Vegas because they had all of their system mods for all of their sponsors.
[2727.92 → 2729.86] So I had totally forgotten about that.
[2729.86 → 2736.60] That was the early days when everything was like, just like, get her done by any means necessary.
[2737.06 → 2738.84] It was in the trailer, wasn't it?
[2739.12 → 2739.88] Or something?
[2740.06 → 2740.44] Something.
[2740.58 → 2741.48] I don't remember.
[2741.50 → 2745.90] Because I remember I was telling someone this story recently, but I couldn't remember why I went down there.
[2745.96 → 2752.02] But I took a train down there to pick up the old SUV, which is probably what Nick dropped it off in.
[2752.64 → 2754.48] Oh, that SUV was a piece of crap.
[2754.48 → 2755.84] Oh, yeah, it was a little rough.
[2756.08 → 2759.34] I still remember when I realized on the highway that it didn't have ABS.
[2760.26 → 2764.54] I still remember my parents telling me what great condition it was in when we bought it from them.
[2765.90 → 2766.34] Anyway.
[2768.16 → 2770.10] Never buy a car from a family member.
[2770.78 → 2773.36] All the other company vehicles have lasted a long time.
[2773.50 → 2776.04] Well, yeah, because I picked them.
[2777.34 → 2777.78] Anywho.
[2779.04 → 2783.74] Oh, it's not Nick Light as opposed to Nick Full Fat or whatever.
[2783.74 → 2785.48] It's Nick L-I-G-H-T.
[2785.64 → 2786.54] It's his last name.
[2786.82 → 2787.46] Yeah, yeah.
[2787.62 → 2790.22] It's definitely not the opposite of...
[2790.22 → 2790.68] Wait, sorry.
[2794.42 → 2796.08] Oh, what are we supposed to be doing?
[2796.72 → 2797.60] Oh, yes.
[2797.74 → 2798.06] Good.
[2798.98 → 2799.72] Nick Dark.
[2800.72 → 2801.60] No, not that either.
[2802.04 → 2802.68] Just Nick Light.
[2803.12 → 2803.88] Oh, dude, man.
[2804.02 → 2807.62] I made the funniest jokes about Nick Light.
[2807.62 → 2813.90] I was like, I don't need a filming light because I've got two lights when he was holding his baby.
[2814.00 → 2815.26] You should have seen high school, man.
[2816.40 → 2816.88] Oh, yeah.
[2817.10 → 2817.24] Okay.
[2817.52 → 2817.74] Yeah.
[2818.44 → 2819.22] A lot of light jokes.
[2819.42 → 2819.70] Yeah.
[2819.92 → 2820.76] Can I get a light?
[2821.76 → 2822.62] Okay, it doesn't matter.
[2822.72 → 2824.62] If I remember correctly, there was...
[2824.62 → 2824.90] Nope.
[2825.62 → 2825.94] Nope.
[2826.22 → 2827.14] I'm not going to use names.
[2827.62 → 2827.80] Cool.
[2827.80 → 2829.72] But there was someone else's name that went well with it.
[2830.80 → 2831.62] That's all I'll say.
[2831.62 → 2833.26] All right.
[2833.76 → 2835.22] Oh, no way.
[2836.26 → 2836.72] Yeah.
[2837.16 → 2838.30] It's finally here.
[2838.52 → 2839.12] Yeah.
[2839.94 → 2841.90] Introducing the chocolate...
[2841.90 → 2842.16] No, wait.
[2842.22 → 2842.36] Sorry.
[2842.82 → 2846.14] Introducing the backpack rain cover.
[2846.86 → 2855.84] You should all know it's always best to protect your load, especially when things get really wet outside.
[2856.82 → 2857.50] Seriously?
[2858.04 → 2859.96] That's the marketing spiel?
[2860.96 → 2861.46] Yeah.
[2861.94 → 2866.14] That's why we designed this rain cover for your LTT backpack.
[2867.20 → 2871.60] This is one of the times that size really does matter.
[2871.74 → 2872.82] Okay, so it's on purpose.
[2873.14 → 2873.68] It's on purpose.
[2873.68 → 2880.70] Since most rain covers are not big enough to accommodate the sheer girth of the LTT backpack.
[2880.84 → 2881.58] Is this you now?
[2881.66 → 2882.94] Is this in the writing or are you just doing this?
[2882.94 → 2883.42] No, it's not in there.
[2883.58 → 2883.92] Okay.
[2884.12 → 2890.12] It's an extra layer of protection to keep your stuff dry while also adding visibility to your bag in the dark
[2890.12 → 2895.84] with a snazzy mountain landscape inspired reflective design.
[2895.84 → 2896.94] Genuinely looks really sharp.
[2896.94 → 2906.24] It also packs neatly into a tippable carrying case that you can attach to your bag's carabiner or accessory loops and is now available at leg.GG slash rain cover.
[2906.24 → 2911.56] It's also durable.
[2911.56 → 2920.70] That was a surprisingly long project to get the costing and the quality and the reflectiveness right and the printing quality and the just oh my god.
[2920.70 → 2923.72] Anyway, are you looking for a last minute gift?
[2924.02 → 2930.78] It's never been a better time to purchase an LTT store gift card for that special LTT enjoyer in your life.
[2930.96 → 2931.40] Why?
[2931.70 → 2940.26] Because nothing says I didn't leave this to the last minute better than an excuse that you had to wait for the brand new LTT commuter backpack to launch the day after Christmas.
[2940.62 → 2944.56] Since that's why you got them a gift card and not an actual gift.
[2944.78 → 2945.00] Yeah.
[2945.00 → 2949.92] So cover your ass at leg.GG slash not a last minute gift.
[2950.48 → 2950.62] Yeah.
[2951.22 → 2953.12] Question that you might not know the answer to.
[2953.28 → 2953.44] Yeah.
[2953.48 → 2954.88] I see there's a pull thingy on this.
[2954.88 → 2955.08] Yes.
[2955.12 → 2956.26] I don't know if they can see it very well.
[2956.36 → 2956.56] Yes.
[2956.98 → 2958.32] Would this fit on the commuter?
[2960.74 → 2962.32] I doubt it, but we can find out.
[2962.44 → 2963.56] It's probably a little big for the commuter.
[2963.56 → 2964.36] Probably a little big.
[2964.36 → 2970.98] It was designed before the commuter was like a sparkle in the eye of our designers.
[2971.26 → 2980.38] We actually started on the rain fly or the rain cover, I think almost immediately after the launch of the backpack.
[2981.06 → 2981.38] So like...
[2981.38 → 2982.92] It's been a while.
[2984.50 → 2986.96] That link goes to the forum.
[2987.40 → 2987.94] Oh, hey!
[2988.68 → 2988.98] No, no.
[2989.00 → 2990.04] I got my commuter bag on me.
[2990.08 → 2991.42] We can check it right now, and we can have a look.
[2991.42 → 2992.42] Um...
[2992.42 → 2995.52] Artie, you going to fix that link?
[2996.24 → 2997.16] That link broke.
[2997.54 → 2998.34] Oh, apparently the link is broken.
[2998.34 → 2998.64] Artie!
[2998.80 → 2999.38] The link goes to the forum?
[2999.38 → 3000.02] Artie, the link's broken!
[3000.54 → 3000.94] Okay.
[3001.28 → 3002.74] So, um...
[3002.74 → 3003.04] Yeah.
[3003.72 → 3004.70] The link is not broken.
[3004.70 → 3008.62] Okay, so now I just gotta find out if there are two layers on the rain cover.
[3009.02 → 3010.02] Someone get me a knife.
[3012.68 → 3014.08] The link's working fine.
[3014.22 → 3016.80] Dude, I wouldn't recommend this.
[3017.14 → 3017.60] Too loose?
[3017.80 → 3020.56] Yeah, this is not...
[3020.56 → 3023.20] This is like clown level.
[3023.24 → 3026.44] Maybe in a pinch situation, but don't buy it for that.
[3026.50 → 3027.84] No, don't buy it for that at all.
[3027.94 → 3028.84] Not even in a pinch.
[3028.92 → 3029.36] No pinch.
[3030.36 → 3031.54] It's not for that.
[3031.88 → 3032.14] No, no.
[3032.20 → 3035.46] I mean, like, if you have both bags, and you just need something...
[3035.46 → 3035.56] Oh, sure.
[3035.56 → 3039.32] ...and you already have the cover anyway, like, you could use it, but you shouldn't buy it for that reason.
[3039.36 → 3039.38] No.
[3039.38 → 3040.84] Just take your other backpack.
[3041.18 → 3041.38] Yeah.
[3041.68 → 3042.12] Oh, yeah.
[3042.26 → 3043.72] I just wouldn't.
[3043.76 → 3044.02] No.
[3044.20 → 3044.48] No.
[3044.56 → 3045.16] I don't like it.
[3045.32 → 3048.84] So we'll work on a rain cover for the commuter bag eventually.
[3049.00 → 3053.80] Now that we have a good supplier for them, and now that we've, like, got most of the hard stuff out of the way,
[3053.86 → 3057.68] we've got good printing quality and everything, it shouldn't be too much work for us to get on something.
[3057.68 → 3059.68] Nice.
[3059.68 → 3060.04] Okay.
[3060.60 → 3063.36] Also, Float plane announcing Yvonne week.
[3063.44 → 3064.50] We're supposed to watch a video.
[3065.54 → 3066.28] His wife.
[3066.68 → 3067.48] My wife.
[3069.64 → 3070.76] Oh, wow.
[3072.04 → 3072.26] What?
[3072.34 → 3073.76] They got her to do this?
[3074.52 → 3075.74] Look at the look on her face.
[3075.78 → 3079.98] You can tell exactly how thrilled she is about being dressed up as Burger King.
[3079.98 → 3085.24] That is the closest resemblance, I think.
[3085.66 → 3086.02] Wow.
[3086.32 → 3086.60] Okay.
[3086.82 → 3089.02] Well, sorry, Burger Queen.
[3089.36 → 3089.98] Excuse me.
[3090.14 → 3090.42] Sorry.
[3090.70 → 3091.00] Sorry.
[3091.06 → 3091.40] My bad.
[3093.44 → 3095.00] Oh, I do want to mute that first.
[3095.10 → 3095.26] Sorry.
[3095.32 → 3095.64] My bad.
[3095.68 → 3096.02] One sec.
[3096.02 → 3101.92] But, but, but, but, but, where, oh, where'd I put it?
[3102.28 → 3104.16] Wait, she's in the thumbnails of all the...
[3104.16 → 3106.16] Oh, that's hilarious.
[3106.16 → 3107.18] I didn't put that together.
[3107.36 → 3109.84] They replaced me in all the thumbnails here.
[3109.84 → 3112.08] I was like, she hosted the Ferroelectric Ram video?
[3112.08 → 3113.10] No, she really didn't.
[3113.66 → 3114.96] This one's the best.
[3115.84 → 3116.62] Okay, here we go.
[3116.66 → 3116.92] We ready?
[3118.02 → 3118.48] Hey, everyone.
[3118.60 → 3119.18] It's Yvonne week.
[3119.36 → 3121.94] And to start, we're going to clean up some of the LMG stuff on here.
[3122.28 → 3124.18] Let's get rid of some of this controversial stuff.
[3124.18 → 3125.40] Perfect.
[3125.84 → 3126.04] Okay.
[3126.24 → 3127.72] Now we're going to add the best house.
[3128.74 → 3129.10] Awesome.
[3129.42 → 3129.68] Okay.
[3129.92 → 3133.10] Now, to celebrate, here are some of the Yvonne for the Clint exclusives this week.
[3138.34 → 3141.02] Hologram says, do you want your husband to grow out his beard again?
[3141.28 → 3141.60] Yes.
[3142.06 → 3144.34] So we're actually up to five cats now.
[3144.44 → 3145.86] This is Panda over here.
[3146.04 → 3146.94] And this is Missy.
[3147.18 → 3147.80] I feel inadequate.
[3148.82 → 3151.06] How do you deal with people with short attention spans?
[3151.22 → 3152.86] Feel personally attacked right now.
[3152.94 → 3154.04] Okay, five minutes per ornament.
[3154.18 → 3155.20] We need, let's say, what?
[3155.26 → 3156.04] Like 20 ornaments?
[3156.80 → 3158.54] That's 100 minutes.
[3159.06 → 3160.28] What did I say that was going to take us?
[3160.28 → 3160.56] An hour?
[3160.70 → 3160.94] An hour.
[3161.90 → 3164.72] Best relationship tip that you always follow and why?
[3164.82 → 3166.80] At first, my answer was communication.
[3167.04 → 3170.72] But then I realized, as I was thinking that through, that it's commitment.
[3170.94 → 3173.18] You might not want to compromise or affect change.
[3173.24 → 3175.00] You're just talking to somebody about how you feel.
[3177.46 → 3180.36] That is his unhappy, I want to get out noise.
[3180.36 → 3183.86] That'll be fun.
[3184.24 → 3184.76] All right.
[3184.82 → 3186.18] So it's Yvonne week.
[3186.40 → 3187.42] I like the people weeks.
[3187.42 → 3189.90] Three special float plane exclusives.
[3190.04 → 3193.40] A Q&A, decorating a tech tree, and meet the cats.
[3193.60 → 3196.92] Yvonne may also appear on a video or two outside of float plane next week.
[3196.98 → 3201.92] So keep an eye out as we celebrate one of the OG-est of the OGs.
[3201.92 → 3203.64] Two fantastic comments under the video.
[3205.08 → 3208.74] SteveJ3D says, finally, the real owner of LMG getting some screen time.
[3209.28 → 3214.24] Another one is Awaken said, an entire week of Yvonne tent.
[3214.60 → 3215.10] Yes, please.
[3215.30 → 3216.02] Yvonne tent.
[3216.24 → 3217.10] I thought those were pretty fun.
[3217.10 → 3217.42] You know what?
[3217.52 → 3218.54] I actually, I like it.
[3218.74 → 3219.80] I like it a lot.
[3219.92 → 3220.98] That's very good.
[3221.24 → 3221.84] That's cute.
[3222.66 → 3223.10] Okay.
[3223.64 → 3225.26] More float plane exclusive merch?
[3225.46 → 3226.12] Oh, we have merch.
[3226.48 → 3226.72] Yeah.
[3226.72 → 3231.66] For LTT float plane subscribers, our second float plane X LTT store collab drops today.
[3232.18 → 3235.28] Second image after the backpack rain cover on LTT store.
[3235.42 → 3235.52] Okay.
[3235.54 → 3236.88] Luke, I'm going to have you showing that.
[3237.04 → 3237.90] I haven't seen this.
[3237.98 → 3239.58] Included in this drop are two shirts.
[3239.72 → 3244.82] The Content Cosmos tee, which was designed by Sarah live on float plane, fuelled with ideas
[3244.82 → 3245.38] from chat.
[3246.00 → 3248.52] Legally distinct Firefox Pyrokitsuni.
[3248.68 → 3250.78] I don't know what that means, but that's on there.
[3251.08 → 3255.36] And the float plane exclusive tee, a simple float plane logo on a light blue t-shirt, which
[3255.36 → 3257.18] you all have requested.
[3258.12 → 3258.64] Whoa.
[3261.26 → 3262.04] There you go.
[3262.14 → 3262.92] Oh, that's super cute.
[3264.18 → 3266.54] Does it really have a flying fox?
[3268.60 → 3272.48] Oh, Legally Distinct Firefox Pyrokitsuni.
[3273.16 → 3274.46] I get it now.
[3274.46 → 3274.68] This is awesome.
[3274.78 → 3275.98] It looks like those old comics.
[3276.90 → 3279.04] An Adventure Through the Content Cosmos.
[3279.24 → 3280.18] This is sick.
[3280.58 → 3282.20] That is actually very cool.
[3282.54 → 3283.40] Good price too.
[3283.58 → 3283.86] Nice.
[3284.16 → 3284.40] Yeah.
[3284.40 → 3285.04] Nice.
[3286.46 → 3290.56] These fly out onto the store on January 1st, 2025.
[3290.90 → 3291.12] Oh, wait.
[3291.18 → 3292.52] They fly off the store.
[3293.32 → 3298.62] So if you're interested, buy yours before then at leg.GG slash FP exclusive.
[3299.34 → 3299.84] Very cool.
[3299.94 → 3300.22] All right.
[3300.26 → 3300.46] There.
[3300.54 → 3301.60] That's all the announcements.
[3301.78 → 3303.10] We are done with announcements.
[3304.14 → 3304.40] Dan.
[3304.54 → 3304.74] Sure.
[3304.86 → 3306.46] You want to show us how merch messages work?
[3306.74 → 3308.20] We already did one, but let's do another one.
[3308.24 → 3308.72] How about that?
[3308.88 → 3309.14] Sure.
[3309.40 → 3310.24] Hi, LDL.
[3310.26 → 3311.92] I'm going to be setting up my very first NAS.
[3312.10 → 3313.44] Yes, I'm considering Hexes.
[3313.44 → 3317.22] I just want to set up a system to manage my Linux ISOs.
[3317.30 → 3320.32] Has there been any update to the issues you've had with Plex?
[3320.32 → 3325.48] I have found that downloading is a little better.
[3326.10 → 3330.86] In general, I have found it to be a little improved.
[3331.08 → 3337.44] They have not addressed all the issues that I kind of laid out as my requirements for
[3337.44 → 3339.86] us to work with them in an official capacity again.
[3339.86 → 3347.92] I still am a Plex user, but I won't do sponsor stuff with them until they actually fulfill
[3347.92 → 3354.10] all the stuff that bothers me about the software that was part of what I supposedly have as
[3354.10 → 3355.50] a lifetime Plex Pass owner.
[3357.68 → 3358.16] Yeah.
[3362.80 → 3363.28] Cool.
[3363.28 → 3364.08] It is what it is.
[3364.08 → 3365.36] It is what it is for now.
[3369.94 → 3373.16] She asks, do you transcode down on download?
[3373.28 → 3374.38] That's the part that really sucks.
[3374.92 → 3375.22] Yes.
[3375.26 → 3376.54] That's exactly the point.
[3376.64 → 3380.90] I don't want to copy full-size files onto my phone for the plane or whatever.
[3381.02 → 3388.70] I want to put like 320 kilobits or whatever per second, just the crappiest possible thing
[3388.70 → 3392.40] as long as the audio is listenable because I'm just like, I'm on a plane.
[3392.48 → 3392.84] I don't care.
[3392.92 → 3394.62] I don't want it to take up a ton of space on my phone.
[3394.76 → 3398.12] I'd rather have a bigger library to pick from, especially if it's for kids or whatever,
[3398.24 → 3400.26] so they can sort of browse and stuff.
[3400.40 → 3401.26] They're not going to care.
[3402.54 → 3402.74] Yeah.
[3402.74 → 3403.90] Well, they'll care about the library.
[3404.04 → 3404.20] Yeah.
[3404.26 → 3405.36] They won't care about quality.
[3405.52 → 3406.54] Especially video quality.
[3406.68 → 3409.80] Everyone cares about audio quality up to a certain point.
[3413.26 → 3414.84] Oh, it says two more topics.
[3415.30 → 3416.78] Dan doesn't talk to us anymore.
[3416.88 → 3418.36] He just puts paper on the monitor.
[3418.70 → 3420.02] I don't blame him, honestly.
[3420.60 → 3421.32] We're awful.
[3422.24 → 3423.40] I mean, do you want me to yell at you more?
[3423.48 → 3424.18] I can yell at you more.
[3424.20 → 3425.24] You can yell at me all you want.
[3425.36 → 3425.78] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3425.80 → 3426.50] I'm into it.
[3426.68 → 3429.24] I thought you were still doing the merch message.
[3429.80 → 3430.40] No, I'm done.
[3430.80 → 3431.96] That's all I have to say about that.
[3431.96 → 3433.58] Do we talk about gaming industry stuff?
[3433.72 → 3434.06] Coffeyville?
[3434.22 → 3434.62] Do it.
[3435.58 → 3440.12] Coffeyville, known for his investigative videos on scam topics, including crypto-related scams,
[3440.44 → 3444.12] released a video going after the CSGO gambling scene.
[3444.46 → 3448.28] I think we all knew it was just an amount of time until that would happen.
[3448.96 → 3453.16] In the video, Coffeyville says that he was paid an embarrassingly low amount of money
[3453.16 → 3459.46] by CSGO Empire, a CSGO gambling site, to investigate their competitor, CSGO Roll.
[3459.90 → 3462.66] So you just put CSGO and then anything after it?
[3463.02 → 3466.00] For scamming users in the CSGO gambling scene.
[3466.62 → 3471.20] Coffee then decided to flip the script, denying the offer, but still making a multipart series.
[3471.32 → 3473.02] I'd like to interject for a second here.
[3473.24 → 3473.56] Yes.
[3474.36 → 3475.70] What were they thinking?
[3475.92 → 3477.12] That was really dumb.
[3477.24 → 3483.84] Drawing attention to their whole grift and their whole deal by involving Coffeyville in it.
[3484.38 → 3484.74] Were they high?
[3484.74 → 3487.94] Like there's so many things going on in the crypto world.
[3488.18 → 3489.44] They could have just stayed under the radar.
[3489.44 → 3490.94] Let them focus on crypto.
[3490.94 → 3492.12] Like forever.
[3492.12 → 3498.66] And they could have just done their skins and their gambling and their holographic whatever Damascus.
[3498.66 → 3499.10] Offer not paid?
[3499.32 → 3499.90] We didn't...
[3499.90 → 3500.12] Wait.
[3501.56 → 3502.08] Yeah, offer.
[3502.32 → 3503.78] He was offered to be paid.
[3504.04 → 3504.62] Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[3504.68 → 3504.88] Yes.
[3505.76 → 3506.92] He didn't take the offer.
[3507.34 → 3509.46] Did I not say the denying their offer part?
[3509.98 → 3510.84] It doesn't matter.
[3510.94 → 3511.56] Or was that the next line?
[3511.66 → 3512.22] It doesn't matter.
[3512.32 → 3517.98] The point is, I will clarify, they made an offer to pay him to investigate their competitor.
[3518.26 → 3519.00] He didn't take it.
[3519.00 → 3523.08] So potentially the next line was Coffee then decided to flip the script denying the offer.
[3523.48 → 3523.60] Yeah.
[3523.60 → 3524.94] So it was just...
[3524.94 → 3526.14] It shouldn't have said paid in the first part.
[3526.58 → 3530.50] But still making a multipart series about the CSGO gambling epidemic.
[3531.16 → 3535.80] That for a ton of you watching.
[3536.64 → 3537.92] Thanks for a ton of you watching.
[3538.74 → 3539.70] Elijah did this one.
[3539.74 → 3540.00] It's okay.
[3540.04 → 3540.40] He tries.
[3543.78 → 3544.14] Anyway.
[3544.32 → 3545.32] We really like him.
[3545.62 → 3546.40] He's kind.
[3546.40 → 3549.08] He's a kind person.
[3549.34 → 3553.26] There's an Elijah note here as well that says YouTubers have been getting in trouble since at least 2014.
[3553.98 → 3556.68] I mean, probably since YouTube existed.
[3557.08 → 3558.80] People just don't care anymore.
[3558.96 → 3561.02] It has become so accepted in our society.
[3561.16 → 3561.82] It's crazy.
[3562.12 → 3566.44] This is a literal multi-billion dollar industry that so few people even know about.
[3566.44 → 3574.16] But like Coffeyville highlights in the video, it's really dangerous to try and go after these companies as they will literally hire hitmen and rioters.
[3574.64 → 3575.08] Okay.
[3575.28 → 3575.56] Wow.
[3575.64 → 3577.88] That sounds like an interesting video to watch.
[3577.92 → 3578.06] Yeah.
[3578.16 → 3583.14] This is sort of to go along with Elijah's commentary here.
[3583.30 → 3585.24] This is such a great question.
[3585.24 → 3587.38] Why?
[3587.38 → 3587.74] Yeah.
[3588.42 → 3592.24] Why was this a slap on the wrist, legally speaking?
[3592.72 → 3604.96] And why has everyone just kind of like forgotten that these two people were pretending to gamble on a site that it turned out that they owned?
[3604.96 → 3610.54] They claimed to have a sponsorship, but actually they owned it.
[3610.54 → 3621.68] No financial settlements, no fines, no jail time as they promoted this gambling site that they owned and were pretending to win big on to minors.
[3624.12 → 3624.76] What?
[3625.24 → 3626.16] Yeah, wacky.
[3626.16 → 3634.44] The same week, award-winning indie game Bellatrix, which is a roguelike poker game, but with no actual gambling.
[3634.96 → 3637.10] Well, it's fine.
[3637.20 → 3637.86] Just read the thing.
[3638.14 → 3642.32] It got an 18 plus rating for including gambling elements.
[3642.46 → 3643.76] It's got roulette in it.
[3643.84 → 3645.00] Yet games that...
[3645.00 → 3645.34] Wait, what?
[3645.44 → 3649.56] I know, but the Pokémon game has a casino in it.
[3649.84 → 3650.00] Yeah.
[3650.12 → 3652.36] Pokémon Blue has a casino in it.
[3652.42 → 3652.68] Yeah.
[3653.02 → 3654.04] Calm down.
[3654.04 → 3661.04] Yet games that have actual dacha mechanics with actual money tied to them continue to be rated 3+.
[3661.04 → 3667.76] For example, EA Sports FC is a 3-plus rated game that you can like buy.
[3667.86 → 3673.04] I'm assuming you can buy some form of like a card opening thing for their...
[3673.04 → 3675.00] What is it called?
[3675.70 → 3676.12] Loot boxes.
[3676.76 → 3681.94] Yeah, no, I know not loot boxes, but I think you get like player cards, and you use them in their like pro league thing or something.
[3682.02 → 3682.40] I don't know.
[3682.48 → 3682.80] Who cares?
[3682.80 → 3683.20] I don't play it.
[3683.20 → 3683.70] So yeah, whatever.
[3683.70 → 3688.22] I don't need to contribute to their billions and billions of dollars.
[3688.48 → 3691.10] Yeah, you buy FIFA points to open card packs.
[3691.28 → 3691.46] Ugh.
[3692.16 → 3692.52] Just.
[3692.94 → 3694.58] Have none of these people heard of a roguelike before?
[3694.58 → 3695.24] Ultimate team.
[3695.36 → 3695.94] There we go.
[3696.16 → 3696.36] Yeah.
[3697.62 → 3698.30] Discussion question.
[3698.40 → 3701.96] How do you think the games industry is able to skirt around traditional gambling laws?
[3702.02 → 3702.68] I don't know.
[3702.82 → 3703.90] I genuinely have no idea.
[3703.98 → 3704.70] We've been talking about this the whole time WAN shows existed.
[3704.70 → 3705.40] I don't know.
[3705.54 → 3706.92] I don't understand it.
[3707.20 → 3708.68] It doesn't make any sense to me.
[3708.70 → 3709.98] I mean, that whole thing with Syndicate.
[3709.98 → 3712.44] I remember talking about it on WAN show at the time.
[3712.50 → 3712.66] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3712.66 → 3712.98] 100%.
[3712.98 → 3718.38] Because like this was one that like kind of, I don't know, it felt closer to me than most things.
[3718.38 → 3719.36] This was huge at the time.
[3719.36 → 3720.62] Because I know the guy.
[3721.08 → 3721.24] Yeah.
[3721.24 → 3723.24] Like I've met him a couple of times, I think.
[3723.60 → 3723.76] Yeah.
[3723.80 → 3727.30] And I'm just like, I've actually run into him since then.
[3727.30 → 3729.38] And I just like had no idea what to say.
[3729.44 → 3730.12] Because I'm just like.
[3730.24 → 3731.04] How are you still here?
[3732.30 → 3733.14] Well, right?
[3733.36 → 3733.62] Yeah.
[3735.30 → 3735.64] Well, yeah.
[3736.70 → 3737.10] Dude.
[3737.68 → 3742.84] And I hate to like, you know, pull an L is for narcissist and make this about myself.
[3742.84 → 3746.92] But are you fucking kidding me?
[3747.54 → 3749.36] The kind of flack that I took.
[3753.72 → 3754.86] Maybe you should have gone harder.
[3756.54 → 3757.94] Maybe that's your lesson.
[3758.00 → 3759.76] Maybe I should have run pulled a crypto coin.
[3759.88 → 3760.10] Yeah.
[3760.48 → 3763.70] And people, and instead people have been like, that guy.
[3763.84 → 3764.04] Yeah.
[3764.22 → 3765.52] Maybe that should just be my shtick.
[3765.74 → 3765.86] Yeah.
[3765.86 → 3768.64] Maybe I should do it every six months and then nobody would bat an eye.
[3768.82 → 3769.44] Linus coin, dude.
[3770.20 → 3770.76] Should have done it.
[3770.76 → 3772.92] Should have done it.
[3773.54 → 3776.88] Next question is, do you think the rating on Bellatrix is fair?
[3777.00 → 3777.08] No!
[3777.08 → 3780.42] It technically has gamble elements even though there is zero monetary gain.
[3780.56 → 3781.62] It's a roguelike!
[3781.66 → 3782.98] No, it's not fair.
[3784.12 → 3784.90] Dude, like.
[3785.04 → 3785.76] Oh, man.
[3786.56 → 3788.68] I sort of maybe understand.
[3788.86 → 3792.16] I do, but you have to have consistency in the enforcement.
[3792.38 → 3792.96] That's the big problem.
[3792.96 → 3797.24] If it was just Bellatrix that got hit by this, which it is, that's a problem.
[3797.48 → 3797.72] Yes.
[3797.72 → 3801.84] If it was like everything that has gambling elements gets hit, then it's like, oh, okay.
[3801.94 → 3803.44] Well, that's a different thing.
[3803.86 → 3809.48] Because I could totally see someone getting into, what was it, Blackjack based, right?
[3809.82 → 3810.12] Poker?
[3810.22 → 3810.84] No, poker based.
[3811.16 → 3812.16] It's made up.
[3812.82 → 3813.40] Sort of.
[3813.46 → 3814.50] Yeah, but it's based on poker.
[3814.56 → 3814.88] Yeah, basically.
[3815.14 → 3815.24] Yeah.
[3815.24 → 3820.46] So I could see someone getting interested in real poker based on, and then probably getting
[3820.46 → 3820.94] really bored.
[3821.30 → 3824.38] But Tynan brings up an excellent point in the chat.
[3824.50 → 3825.84] Tynan from Creator Warehouse.
[3825.84 → 3830.18] If he's still at work, before you leave, do you mind bringing us an update for Mayor
[3830.18 → 3832.80] Mc Cheese here on the bit holder?
[3832.96 → 3835.44] Just if you could bring over the finished one.
[3835.66 → 3835.98] He's not.
[3836.08 → 3836.86] He's being super.
[3836.98 → 3837.70] Oh, is he not here anymore?
[3837.70 → 3838.02] Okay.
[3838.14 → 3839.22] I'll go get it later then.
[3839.30 → 3840.02] Okay, Mc Cheese?
[3840.68 → 3841.08] Chill.
[3841.50 → 3842.72] Stop being cheesed.
[3842.72 → 3845.32] Tynan brings up a good point.
[3846.16 → 3851.36] By that logic, is rolling a die to see the damage you hit not gambling then?
[3851.66 → 3852.30] I think no.
[3852.74 → 3853.50] My reason for this...
[3853.50 → 3853.52] I don't know.
[3853.52 → 3854.92] There are lots of dice games, boys.
[3854.92 → 3856.50] My reason for this is that...
[3856.50 → 3856.82] Oh.
[3859.26 → 3862.44] Is there any dice game that's specifically based on that, though, that isn't just D&D?
[3862.76 → 3865.44] Because, like, Also is specifically based on poker.
[3865.74 → 3871.04] I don't know every dice game, but I do know that just, like, rolling dice and seeing if
[3871.04 → 3871.50] you'll win...
[3871.50 → 3872.08] Someone said craps.
[3872.08 → 3874.04] Is 100% gambling.
[3874.22 → 3875.96] It's like a gambling game.
[3876.12 → 3878.06] You just dice.
[3878.48 → 3879.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3881.96 → 3887.90] Either way, quite literal, actual gambling being rated as 3+, while Also is 18+, is just
[3887.90 → 3888.30] bad.
[3888.64 → 3888.94] Yeah.
[3889.10 → 3889.78] That's not good.
[3890.00 → 3890.96] I haven't tried Also.
[3891.10 → 3892.52] Apparently, it's phenomenal.
[3892.84 → 3895.40] It's, like, one of the best roguelikes ever made.
[3896.68 → 3897.70] I like it.
[3897.86 → 3899.44] And it doesn't matter that it's poker hands?
[3899.44 → 3900.32] I don't like it as much as a lot of other people like.
[3900.58 → 3901.48] But I like it.
[3901.48 → 3902.04] Okay.
[3902.94 → 3904.68] Finally getting my kids into cards.
[3905.76 → 3908.10] Yeah, we just never did it.
[3908.18 → 3909.46] We just, like, never played cards.
[3909.92 → 3915.62] We've sat around, and we've had, like, family hearts night twice this week.
[3916.30 → 3917.36] Have you ever played hearts?
[3917.72 → 3918.36] I like hearts.
[3918.56 → 3918.76] Yeah.
[3918.76 → 3919.88] I love hearts.
[3919.88 → 3920.42] Hearts is fun.
[3920.96 → 3927.70] It integrates a lot of the cool things about, like, card games in person, I think.
[3927.78 → 3931.62] It's a nice mix of luck and strategy.
[3931.72 → 3931.92] Yeah.
[3931.92 → 3937.50] Because the rounds are not the rounds, but the game is long enough that if you're a good
[3937.50 → 3940.08] player, you can give yourself a much better chance to win.
[3940.18 → 3943.10] But obviously, a little bit of an element of luck is fun.
[3943.44 → 3944.74] I also like the card passing.
[3946.02 → 3946.46] Yeah.
[3946.46 → 3949.08] The card passing element and the strategy involved in that.
[3949.08 → 3952.58] If it didn't have card passing, honestly, it just wouldn't be anywhere near as good of
[3952.58 → 3952.84] a game.
[3952.92 → 3953.08] No.
[3953.24 → 3954.66] That's a hugely important part.
[3955.08 → 3955.28] Yep.
[3955.74 → 3956.56] No, I, uh, no.
[3956.56 → 3962.20] And, and it's been, it's been fascinating to see how super, like, hyper engaged the
[3962.20 → 3962.96] kids have been with it.
[3963.46 → 3967.70] Like, they, it's like, hey, do you guys want to, do you want to do hearts night?
[3967.74 → 3970.48] After the first night, it's like, hey, do you guys want to do, like, hearts night?
[3970.84 → 3973.16] And they were, like, immediately at the table.
[3973.34 → 3973.66] Nice.
[3973.72 → 3974.36] Clean up the table.
[3974.58 → 3975.64] We got some really nice cards.
[3975.72 → 3976.60] We went to Hidden Wonders again.
[3977.44 → 3979.50] Local magic show, absolutely phenomenal.
[3979.66 → 3983.42] If you live in the Vancouver area, if you're visiting soon, and you haven't been to Hidden Wonders.
[3983.78 → 3984.62] It's pretty great.
[3984.62 → 3985.36] Take your hand.
[3985.78 → 3986.04] Okay.
[3986.04 → 3988.26] Just bring it, like, watch this.
[3988.34 → 3989.68] Just put it right here and then.
[3990.32 → 3991.22] That's pretty good.
[3991.36 → 3991.86] Like that.
[3992.00 → 3992.72] That's pretty good.
[3992.94 → 3994.82] Because you're doing yourself a disservice.
[3995.04 → 3995.86] Go to Hidden Wonders.
[3996.54 → 3999.56] The point is, I bought some of his cards because he claimed.
[4000.64 → 4000.86] Sure.
[4000.94 → 4005.12] And I would never trust a magician, but he claimed that they were the best playing cards
[4005.12 → 4005.56] in the world.
[4005.92 → 4006.40] I love them.
[4006.90 → 4008.56] So I was looking for an excuse to play with them.
[4008.68 → 4008.86] Sure.
[4008.96 → 4009.84] So we went last weekend.
[4009.98 → 4012.86] So anyway, I was, so anyway, afterwards, I was like, hey, do you guys want to play, do
[4012.86 → 4013.84] you want to have, like, hearts night again?
[4013.84 → 4017.74] And they were like cleaning up the table so that we could keep our nice cards, like, nice
[4017.74 → 4018.56] and clean and everything.
[4018.90 → 4019.74] Like, getting ready.
[4019.96 → 4021.64] Like, absolutely stoked on it.
[4021.90 → 4023.00] And yeah, it was a blast.
[4023.36 → 4027.94] I used to, when I was considerably younger, my best friend's family would bring me out
[4027.94 → 4030.92] fishing for like two weeks in the summer, which was awesome.
[4030.92 → 4032.16] And we'd camp and fish, and it was great.
[4032.40 → 4032.54] Yeah.
[4032.60 → 4037.56] And one of the things that, like, the boys would do at night was play hearts.
[4038.14 → 4038.46] Yeah.
[4038.60 → 4039.64] And it was awesome.
[4039.72 → 4040.28] It was very fun.
[4040.44 → 4041.60] Nook says, get them into crib.
[4041.74 → 4043.38] It's great for math and counting skills.
[4043.38 → 4044.16] It is.
[4044.74 → 4051.74] I find cribbage to be a little bit luck-based for me to enjoy it as much as I enjoy hearts.
[4051.74 → 4051.82] Yes.
[4053.08 → 4057.18] We, we, I played a my, my grandfather loves cribbage.
[4057.42 → 4059.70] And so I, I would play that with him when I was a kid.
[4059.88 → 4066.98] And it was, it was pretty cool getting to see my, my eldest and learn to play it with
[4066.98 → 4067.18] him.
[4067.18 → 4070.54] Like, we went over and we kind of, like, learned to play with my grandfather.
[4071.32 → 4075.08] And it got to the point where I could be, like, kind of helping in the kitchen and they
[4075.08 → 4075.70] could play a game.
[4075.70 → 4076.24] That's cool.
[4076.40 → 4077.82] That was, that was pretty cool.
[4078.04 → 4082.94] But I can't say that I enjoy crib as much as, uh, as I enjoy hearts.
[4083.04 → 4086.50] My, my main issue with hearts, I also love presidents and assholes.
[4086.82 → 4088.60] Uh, that's, that one's a lot of fun with the big group.
[4088.68 → 4091.68] My main issue with hearts is you got to have four players.
[4092.02 → 4092.18] Yeah.
[4093.60 → 4094.58] Can't have five.
[4094.66 → 4095.48] Can't have three.
[4095.64 → 4095.80] Yep.
[4096.58 → 4097.60] Um, oh yeah.
[4097.76 → 4100.92] Pinky draws says bluff is a great game to play if you have a bunch of incomplete decks.
[4101.12 → 4103.20] Uh, yeah, we, um, we call it cheat.
[4103.42 → 4105.28] That, that's, that's what I always knew it as.
[4105.28 → 4105.88] Have you played cheat?
[4106.22 → 4108.86] Cheat or bluff or a bullshit is it's also called.
[4109.26 → 4109.76] I don't think so.
[4110.00 → 4114.94] Um, it's, it's not as much fun with a small group, but with a big group, like probably
[4114.94 → 4119.90] five to eight, I would say would be your, your optimal group size.
[4120.04 → 4121.88] And then you play with a couple of decks.
[4122.52 → 4123.70] Um, basically.
[4123.70 → 4125.34] Oh, you claim how many of a card you have?
[4125.42 → 4125.88] Is it that game?
[4125.90 → 4127.24] And you put them down face.
[4127.32 → 4127.48] Yeah.
[4127.50 → 4128.76] I've never played it, but I've heard of it.
[4128.80 → 4130.18] It's a lot of, it's a lot of fun.
[4130.18 → 4135.60] If you've got, if you've got a like a good vibe and, uh, and people are kind of in a
[4135.60 → 4139.76] high energy state because it gets really ridiculous because there are wild cards.
[4140.10 → 4145.34] Plus, if you've got two decks, you'll get people making just utterly wild claims, like
[4145.34 → 4146.90] 11 Kings.
[4146.90 → 4150.86] And you'll be like, cheat.
[4151.30 → 4152.02] You pick it up.
[4152.18 → 4153.06] Like, holy shit.
[4153.48 → 4156.32] It's like six Kings and five wild cards.
[4156.54 → 4157.70] Like, oh, okay.
[4157.74 → 4162.02] And then when you, when you call it, and you're wrong, you pick up the entire discard pile and
[4162.02 → 4162.58] bring it into your hand.
[4162.64 → 4167.24] So when you've got like two decks and someone gets a couple bad calls wrong, they've got
[4167.24 → 4169.42] like 48 cards in their hand.
[4169.42 → 4170.96] So they can have anything at that point.
[4171.04 → 4171.16] Yeah.
[4171.32 → 4171.72] Yeah.
[4171.94 → 4174.50] The I think that's called a bunch of different things.
[4174.50 → 4181.06] Um, and you can play it with like dice or, or I, I think, I think people do it with like
[4181.06 → 4184.04] serial numbers on bills and like all this other type of stuff.
[4185.06 → 4185.50] Yeah.
[4185.56 → 4186.56] Cheats, cheats a lot of fun.
[4186.80 → 4189.78] Um, stop cannon says, UNO is fun.
[4189.88 → 4190.86] I've only played UNO once.
[4191.06 → 4191.46] What?
[4191.84 → 4192.08] Yeah.
[4192.34 → 4193.56] I unironically agree.
[4193.84 → 4195.82] UNO is actually a super fun game.
[4196.04 → 4200.30] Um, and it's like, I think maybe it gets a bad rap for being kind of like for kids or
[4200.30 → 4200.60] whatever.
[4200.76 → 4201.02] I don't know.
[4201.02 → 4202.58] I just, it's basically crazy eights.
[4202.64 → 4203.36] We just never had it.
[4203.44 → 4203.56] Yeah.
[4203.56 → 4207.56] It's crazy eights, but there's like more, there's like more cards and the cards are
[4207.56 → 4211.62] tailored for the game rather than just being a standard playing card deck.
[4211.88 → 4212.10] Yeah.
[4212.22 → 4212.38] Yeah.
[4212.38 → 4213.20] Um, yeah.
[4213.28 → 4219.50] UNO is actually like unironically a great game by giant UNO decks.
[4219.62 → 4224.88] One of my biggest problems actually with UNO is buying the first party cards.
[4225.04 → 4226.10] They suck.
[4226.58 → 4228.72] The quality is so low.
[4228.72 → 4234.70] Like it's, it's low enough that it, that it impedes my enjoyment of the game.
[4234.78 → 4235.18] Wow.
[4235.38 → 4237.04] It's like, it's hard to deal with them.
[4237.04 → 4237.76] That's brutal considering it's a card.
[4237.78 → 4238.32] They're sticky.
[4238.50 → 4242.26] Like, and I'll, I'll take a brand-new deck out of the box, and they're like, they kind
[4242.26 → 4246.06] of get stuck on each other and like, they just suck.
[4246.16 → 4247.62] I don't remember them being like that.
[4247.68 → 4250.08] When I was a kid, UNO cards didn't suck.
[4250.78 → 4252.52] And so, um, yeah.
[4252.82 → 4256.14] YellowjacketZak says I have vintage ones that are probably older than me, and you know what?
[4256.18 → 4257.56] They're probably way better quality.
[4257.66 → 4261.08] Cause when I was a kid, I don't remember them having costed them down so much.
[4261.28 → 4261.50] Yeah.
[4261.60 → 4264.20] Like it sucks to see stuff that used to be good.
[4264.68 → 4268.04] Um, Steph Duty says phase 10 is the same issue where the cards suck now.
[4268.06 → 4269.82] I've never, I've never heard of phase 10.
[4269.90 → 4272.76] I don't know what that is, but yeah, just come on, man.
[4272.92 → 4276.18] I just, I want quality stuff that lasts.
[4276.88 → 4278.94] How, how much is that to ask?
[4278.94 → 4282.04] Like apparently a lot, apparently a lot.
[4282.46 → 4282.64] Yeah.
[4283.52 → 4284.10] Um, yeah.
[4284.16 → 4287.48] Crystal says they didn't use to suck, but they changed distributors or something.
[4287.56 → 4290.52] It's like, well, they, then they shouldn't, they should find a good one.
[4291.32 → 4292.86] Just, ah, yeah.
[4293.00 → 4297.50] Anyway, we used to play the, the main board game that we used to play was called Malarkey.
[4297.98 → 4298.34] Oh yeah.
[4298.88 → 4300.16] Have you heard of Malarkey before?
[4300.16 → 4300.70] Can't say I have.
[4301.50 → 4305.56] I don't know if it's like still a game that's sold, but this is like the exact box that it
[4305.56 → 4306.54] was on its Wikipedia.
[4306.76 → 4307.46] So I doubt it.
[4308.94 → 4310.66] Oh, thank you.
[4311.26 → 4311.56] This game.
[4311.72 → 4315.52] Malarkey is a trivia game that incorporates bluffing and into the gameplay.
[4316.00 → 4321.30] And it was, it was super cool because you would, so everyone would, that's Canadian AF.
[4321.46 → 4322.70] Is it, is it a Canadian game?
[4322.76 → 4323.10] I don't know.
[4323.30 → 4325.12] Um, you would get handed out cards.
[4325.26 → 4325.54] Yeah.
[4325.54 → 4330.42] And one person would get a thing that just is like, figure it out.
[4330.68 → 4330.86] Yeah.
[4330.86 → 4333.70] You're going to have to like to make up a lie and everyone else will get facts.
[4333.70 → 4336.32] And then it's like about a thing.
[4336.32 → 4341.42] Oh, that sounds similar to Balderdash where you are given a word that people are unlikely
[4341.42 → 4342.70] to know what it means.
[4342.78 → 4344.68] Oh, you have to say the definition and you have to make up.
[4344.92 → 4347.06] So it's super similar to that.
[4347.14 → 4347.28] Yeah.
[4347.28 → 4351.74] And then you have to like to sell your thing and why it's correct.
[4351.88 → 4354.18] And man, it was like, it was pretty fun.
[4354.36 → 4354.50] Yeah.
[4354.58 → 4357.04] That, that, those types of games are a ton of fun.
[4357.34 → 4357.56] Yeah.
[4357.72 → 4360.72] Um, do you remember this?
[4360.72 → 4368.50] I don't know if anyone else remembers Nightmare, the board, the video board game.
[4369.84 → 4372.44] Um, I feel like I've heard of this.
[4373.60 → 4374.72] It was so.
[4374.72 → 4376.68] I know this frame for sure.
[4376.90 → 4380.20] Oh, apparently it was called Atmosphere somewhere else.
[4380.42 → 4385.42] Well, it was called Nightmare in North America, and it had this like the it had these creepy
[4385.42 → 4391.32] like video VHS tapes that would go along with, that would go along with it.
[4391.56 → 4394.06] Uh, yeah, here's the, uh, what?
[4395.64 → 4396.04] $350.
[4396.60 → 4397.40] Are you kidding me?
[4397.44 → 4398.08] No, no, no.
[4398.10 → 4399.32] Here's one for 60 bucks.
[4401.16 → 4402.66] Nightmare, the video board game.
[4402.74 → 4404.84] Dude, I would, I would totally play this.
[4405.48 → 4407.68] I would totally, I would totally play this thing.
[4407.72 → 4408.06] Hold on.
[4409.04 → 4409.44] Nightmare.
[4409.86 → 4415.08] I bet it sucks, but I played this with my family like a bunch of times when I was a
[4415.08 → 4415.24] kid.
[4416.02 → 4416.56] Why am I on?
[4418.84 → 4419.54] Capra dot.
[4419.62 → 4420.96] Oh, Canadian French.
[4421.06 → 4421.44] Well, whatever.
[4421.52 → 4423.08] I'll deal with this another time, but yeah, Nightmare.
[4424.06 → 4424.84] Is it any good?
[4424.98 → 4426.62] You're going for it tonight.
[4427.70 → 4428.78] Uh, is what any good?
[4428.84 → 4429.16] Nightmare?
[4429.50 → 4430.04] Yeah, I don't know.
[4430.14 → 4431.14] I, I, I don't remember.
[4431.24 → 4434.52] I was probably like nine or whatever when I played it.
[4434.58 → 4436.32] So who knows?
[4437.16 → 4438.10] Um, all right.
[4438.22 → 4439.38] What are we supposed to be doing?
[4439.38 → 4440.00] Oh, shoot.
[4440.12 → 4440.70] Dan's gone.
[4441.16 → 4442.46] Um, um.
[4443.12 → 4443.52] Sponsors.
[4444.30 → 4444.76] Oh, no.
[4444.76 → 4445.46] We can't do it without.
[4445.60 → 4445.72] Right.
[4445.88 → 4446.38] Another topic?
[4446.38 → 4449.98] The FTC is banning hidden fees from hotel and ticket prices.
[4450.16 → 4455.24] New rules set to take effect in April 2025 will require upfront disclosure of the final
[4455.24 → 4460.04] price of hotel stays, vacation rentals, and live event tickets before you reach the checkout.
[4460.04 → 4468.44] First proposed more than a year ago, the rules target resort, convenience, and service fees that are often used to covertly increase profits.
[4468.44 → 4469.44] The fees are still allowed.
[4469.44 → 4470.08] The fees are still allowed.
[4470.08 → 4478.40] The new rules just mean that they must be disclosed earlier in the process and that the total price must be displayed more prominently than most other pricing information.
[4479.08 → 4485.94] Shipping fees and taxes, however, are not subject to the new rules, though they must be disclosed before payment info is collected from the customer.
[4486.32 → 4487.22] I wish taxes were.
[4487.46 → 4491.48] Our discussion question is, can someone point the FTC at ticket scalpers next?
[4491.82 → 4492.32] Yeah, really?
[4492.48 → 4493.30] Yeah, no kidding.
[4493.30 → 4497.30] I don't, I don't, well, we'll see what the FTC keeps doing now that Lena Khan's out.
[4497.44 → 4497.82] Yeah.
[4498.78 → 4499.62] Rip Lena Khan.
[4499.74 → 4501.50] Because this is a Lena Khan era thing.
[4501.66 → 4502.70] Come to Canada, Lena.
[4502.96 → 4503.48] Yes, please.
[4503.76 → 4509.62] We, uh, we'd love to have you here as the I don't know, we, we just, we just got a bunch of new ministers.
[4510.36 → 4511.78] Like, that would have been a perfect opportunity.
[4511.92 → 4513.86] Minister of everything not being shit.
[4514.00 → 4514.92] Whatever title you want.
[4515.04 → 4516.52] Yeah, whatever, whatever you want.
[4516.60 → 4517.64] Lena, just come on up.
[4517.98 → 4519.20] Just, uh, we're in Surrey.
[4519.34 → 4522.92] So if you just head up to Surrey, just knock on the door and just tell them,
[4522.92 → 4526.22] Lena Khan's here and, uh, well, we'll get it worked out.
[4526.30 → 4526.98] We'll take care of everything.
[4527.12 → 4529.18] I'll call up my friend, JT, Mr. Trudeau.
[4529.34 → 4531.28] And, uh, I don't, I don't know Justin Trudeau.
[4531.40 → 4531.58] No.
[4533.04 → 4534.60] But I'll do everything I can.
[4534.68 → 4537.54] I'll do everything in my power to get you in touch with, you know.
[4537.70 → 4538.28] Whoever you need.
[4538.32 → 4540.70] Whoever you need to be, like, in charge of something important.
[4540.90 → 4542.06] Might not be him for much longer.
[4542.26 → 4542.46] Yeah.
[4543.66 → 4544.02] Might?
[4544.48 → 4544.84] Yeah.
[4546.18 → 4547.22] I, you know what?
[4547.22 → 4552.40] I think this is one of those things where the right thing for him to do is just resign.
[4552.90 → 4559.04] And, uh, the problem is that for better or for worse, the Liberal Party of Canada has
[4559.04 → 4561.04] absolutely no one.
[4561.04 → 4561.32] No other candidate.
[4561.62 → 4565.64] No one waiting in the wings with any kind, any kind of charisma.
[4566.28 → 4567.30] Um, so.
[4568.72 → 4569.34] Uh-oh.
[4570.02 → 4570.20] Yeah.
[4570.24 → 4570.86] Good luck, everybody.
[4571.14 → 4571.42] Okay.
[4571.42 → 4574.74] So here's an update for Burger Mc Cheese or whatever.
[4574.74 → 4576.40] I forget what your username was.
[4577.28 → 4577.66] Yes.
[4578.16 → 4580.58] We are working on our bit holder thing.
[4580.70 → 4584.30] You do not have to use a third party bit holder for much longer.
[4584.30 → 4584.96] I promise.
[4585.16 → 4590.32] It has a keyhole thing on the back so that you can put on our magnetic cable management
[4590.32 → 4592.60] thing, and you can just, like, click it onto things.
[4592.78 → 4600.14] It has, like, a soft silicone style thing that feels really nice and is really, like.
[4600.24 → 4600.64] Oh, yeah.
[4600.92 → 4601.42] Quality.
[4601.84 → 4603.04] Feels like it probably won't degrade.
[4603.04 → 4603.08] Sorry.
[4604.08 → 4606.78] Uh, the, sorry, the, the, oh.
[4607.12 → 4612.70] Okay, this one's deep because it's pre-production, but it's supposed to, it's supposed to come
[4612.70 → 4614.52] apart so you can pop the thing off, I think.
[4614.62 → 4617.06] Anyway, the point is, Tynan says soon.
[4617.30 → 4618.38] He says soon, TM.
[4619.24 → 4620.40] Um, there it is.
[4620.56 → 4621.10] All right.
[4621.80 → 4622.18] All right.
[4622.54 → 4622.92] We good?
[4623.44 → 4623.84] We are good.
[4624.02 → 4624.18] Ye.
[4624.18 → 4628.50] No, and no, it's not going to take, like, another two years.
[4628.76 → 4634.56] This is, this is almost final, and I think we do have, like, final tooling for this thing.
[4634.64 → 4637.34] So it is actually, actually very soon.
[4638.34 → 4639.64] No, just the one size for now.
[4640.98 → 4642.98] I'm still over here waiting for the scribe driver pencil.
[4643.10 → 4644.56] Then things take time.
[4644.94 → 4647.04] Do you have any idea how many people work at Creator Warehouse?
[4647.04 → 4650.14] Like, it's, it's only a team of a couple dozen people of which.
[4650.34 → 4650.88] At least two.
[4650.94 → 4654.40] I think only about a half are actually in, like, product design because you have to have
[4654.40 → 4657.44] administration and, like, customer service and, like, all those other things.
[4657.74 → 4660.28] So you look at the number of products that that team creates.
[4660.40 → 4661.92] It's a crazy amount.
[4662.02 → 4663.14] They're actually incredible.
[4663.36 → 4663.56] Yeah.
[4663.74 → 4665.32] So there you go.
[4665.60 → 4666.36] World class.
[4666.98 → 4668.50] World class.
[4669.04 → 4673.08] There's significantly bigger teams that make one product.
[4673.08 → 4674.08] World class.
[4674.54 → 4677.68] Speaking of which, Ridge, our sponsor.

[4891.78 → 4892.98] to be 60 seconds long?
[4892.98 → 4894.30] They should know that you read off the prompt.
[4894.46 → 4895.04] They should know.
[4895.32 → 4896.22] F*** you, San Diego.
[4896.80 → 4897.50] Oh, no, wait.
[4897.58 → 4897.78] Sorry.
[4898.46 → 4898.76] Pulse way.
[4898.80 → 4900.28] Go f*** yourself, San Diego.
[4900.28 → 4906.02] We had a topic we were going to do a while back, which was like your favourite WAN show
[4906.02 → 4906.40] moments.
[4906.90 → 4913.58] And I still have bookmarked when Adam Sondregard wrote that thing in the script, and I was just
[4913.58 → 4915.10] like, whatever, and just read right through it.
[4915.34 → 4916.86] The like Dufy smart camera thing.
[4916.92 → 4917.48] Do you remember that?
[4918.06 → 4918.28] There's a...
[4919.28 → 4920.26] What was it?
[4920.30 → 4921.68] Your taint and balls or whatever.
[4921.68 → 4926.96] Oh, it was so good.
[4930.18 → 4933.74] For those of you in San Diego who are upset, it's an Anchorman reference.
[4933.98 → 4934.40] It's not...
[4934.40 → 4935.38] I don't actually...
[4935.38 → 4939.64] I don't actually care enough about the city of San Diego to have feelings about it.
[4940.28 → 4940.86] I mean...
[4940.86 → 4941.82] Which maybe is worse.
[4941.96 → 4942.52] I don't know.
[4942.58 → 4943.12] Who knows?
[4944.66 → 4945.24] Oh, no.
[4945.24 → 4945.70] It was good.
[4945.74 → 4946.58] I don't have the link anymore.
[4946.64 → 4949.64] I had the link when we were doing the topic, but we didn't end up getting into it for whatever
[4949.64 → 4952.08] reason, but it's a very funny clip.
[4954.16 → 4954.60] Okay.
[4955.24 → 4955.64] Okay.
[4955.76 → 4956.44] Dan, hit us.
[4957.24 → 4957.72] Hi, Linus.
[4957.80 → 4960.92] I was sad to hear that the tall WAN V3 hoodie was off the table.
[4961.20 → 4963.52] What's the minimum order for it to make sense?
[4963.70 → 4965.88] I have a Silicon Valley money.
[4966.64 → 4968.22] How many do you need me to buy?
[4970.72 → 4971.50] Oh, man.
[4971.76 → 4972.16] Investors?
[4973.38 → 4973.78] Okay.
[4973.78 → 4975.02] I like you.
[4975.44 → 4976.42] You're cool.
[4977.24 → 4978.06] I mean...
[4978.06 → 4978.36] Ugh.
[4978.36 → 4980.26] Here's the thing.
[4982.04 → 4987.80] Minimum order on something like a full custom designed hoodie can be a little bit all over
[4987.80 → 4994.78] the place because it depends on how many embellishments you're getting that are like
[4994.78 → 4995.56] custom sourced.
[4995.86 → 5001.58] So let's say you're getting a custom draw cord, or you're getting like a custom zipper pull
[5001.58 → 5003.52] or you're getting a like custom this, custom that.
[5003.52 → 5008.46] Depending on whether it needs to be injection moulded or depending on whether it's machined
[5008.46 → 5013.38] or depending on whom the supplier is and what your negotiated terms with them are, it can
[5013.38 → 5014.42] be all over the place.
[5014.50 → 5015.58] But if I was to say...
[5015.58 → 5019.68] If I was to give you a rough number of how many we would need to produce of a hoodie,
[5020.20 → 5026.12] like a quite custom hoodie like the WAN hoodie, I'd say somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000
[5026.12 → 5027.22] to 3,000 units.
[5027.22 → 5029.80] So that's for all the sizes combined?
[5029.94 → 5031.00] Well, it's complicated, right?
[5031.06 → 5038.18] Because depending on whether your limitation is a custom-dyed roll of fabric or whether
[5038.18 → 5043.84] your limitation is how many you have to buy of some weird carabiner zipper pull or whatever
[5043.84 → 5045.86] it is, that can impact it.
[5045.86 → 5048.98] So if the limitation is fabric, well, you can get around it.
[5049.20 → 5052.50] That's one of the ways that we're able to do so many different prints of the underwear
[5052.50 → 5057.16] because we can make onesies out of them, and we can go through a bunch of the fabric by
[5057.16 → 5057.92] doing onesies.
[5058.78 → 5060.46] And that's the reason why...
[5060.46 → 5066.10] I'm trying to think of something that was quite limited by a custom thing instead.
[5066.20 → 5069.68] I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but there are areas where you can bind
[5069.68 → 5077.24] of account for that in your product mix by using it here so that you can just do a few
[5077.24 → 5079.68] of that kind of fun underwear pack or whatever.
[5080.48 → 5084.22] So what I'm trying to say is it's all over the place, but in general, for a custom hoodie,
[5084.28 → 5087.94] I'd say somewhere between, let's say, 2,000 and 3,000 units to get a run done.
[5089.18 → 5089.40] All right.
[5089.58 → 5090.52] So across...
[5090.52 → 5091.02] Oh, yeah, right.
[5091.06 → 5092.78] So I was going to say another thing is sizing.
[5093.18 → 5097.58] So if you think that it's a design that's going to skew quadruple XL, then you don't have
[5097.58 → 5101.88] to produce that many of them to use up like a custom dye lot, a fabric, for instance.
[5102.52 → 5104.00] So back to WAN hoodie.
[5104.20 → 5108.02] WAN hoodie tends to skew pretty standard for our size mix.
[5108.18 → 5111.94] So we'll probably go from, I think, small to triple XL on that one.
[5111.98 → 5114.02] Don't quote me on that because I don't remember exactly.
[5114.26 → 5115.58] But here's the issue.
[5115.96 → 5117.58] We don't have a tall hoodie...
[5118.26 → 5121.08] We don't have our tall hoodie grading done yet.
[5121.08 → 5126.50] And grading refers to the process of taking your reference sample,
[5126.50 → 5133.04] which is often created as a medium because I'm deeply involved in the development process
[5133.04 → 5135.26] and I like to be able to try it on in order to give feedback.
[5135.48 → 5139.28] And also because medium is the best-selling size, obviously, because that's why it's medium.
[5140.98 → 5145.24] So we have other mediums try them as well to make sure that it's not just made for me.
[5145.40 → 5146.90] But we start with a medium.
[5146.90 → 5151.16] And then grading is the process of taking that medium and building it up
[5151.16 → 5153.34] and building it down to accommodate different sizes.
[5153.34 → 5159.12] The issue is that we don't have our grading done for a tall hoodie.
[5161.18 → 5167.32] It also means that we would need to figure out ahead of time
[5167.32 → 5171.28] what our mix would be when we order these thousands of hoodies.
[5171.54 → 5176.40] So across our sizes, let's say we go small, medium, large, XL, XXL, XXL.
[5176.40 → 5176.98] That's six.
[5177.56 → 5184.02] If we add tall sizes, right, we just doubled our skew count.
[5184.06 → 5184.54] Which is brutal.
[5184.74 → 5185.68] Which is brutal.
[5186.26 → 5186.56] Okay?
[5187.04 → 5191.08] Then we have to make sure that we get the mix across all those different sizes
[5191.08 → 5193.46] in the regular and the tall variant.
[5193.70 → 5198.32] We have to make all of that fit into some reasonable order quantity.
[5198.32 → 5202.76] Let's say, you know, let's say 2,500 units for something like that.
[5203.90 → 5209.90] Then we have to also balance that with that if we absolutely completely flub one of them,
[5209.98 → 5212.72] it's going to be out of stock for like six to eight months
[5212.72 → 5217.08] while we wait for a restocking of all the little bits and bobs that go on it
[5217.08 → 5218.36] and production and shipping.
[5218.36 → 5222.98] It is a lot to manage from a logistic standpoint.
[5223.22 → 5226.98] And I think that often people do not consider
[5226.98 → 5231.74] or they don't have experience with how difficult inventory management can be.
[5231.92 → 5234.00] The number of times that we've had people say,
[5234.20 → 5236.34] why don't you just have an EU distribution centre
[5236.34 → 5238.02] so I don't have to pay as much on shipping?
[5239.00 → 5240.00] When I'm kind of sitting here going,
[5240.16 → 5242.02] yeah, do you think we didn't think of that?
[5242.40 → 5243.32] We've thought of that.
[5243.58 → 5247.52] But now I get to take that, let's say a 3,000 unit order
[5247.52 → 5249.46] because I can sell more because I have tall sizes
[5249.46 → 5251.28] and I have better shipping to the EU.
[5251.44 → 5253.88] I now take that 3,000 unit order.
[5254.18 → 5255.62] I have to get the seismic right.
[5256.02 → 5259.30] And then I have to nail, I have to nail how many of them.
[5259.30 → 5260.90] Seismic might be different geographically.
[5260.90 → 5261.06] Of course it will.
[5261.44 → 5265.20] And so then I have to nail how many of them I send to our EU distribution centre
[5265.20 → 5267.02] or to our NA distribution centre
[5267.02 → 5268.92] or you're going to end up paying more for shipping anyway
[5268.92 → 5270.94] because we're going to be out of smalls in Europe
[5270.94 → 5272.26] where people walk everywhere
[5272.26 → 5275.44] and we're going to be out of XXXLs in the US.
[5275.86 → 5276.76] And it's like, crap.
[5277.52 → 5280.38] So now all we have is an inventory management nightmare
[5280.38 → 5283.10] because you've got to understand we're a small company still
[5283.10 → 5284.10] in the grand scheme of things.
[5284.16 → 5285.90] We are not Uniqlo.
[5286.50 → 5287.60] We're not Lululemon.
[5287.88 → 5292.92] We aren't producing a style on the order of 50,000 units in one shot.
[5293.10 → 5294.10] We're not doing that.
[5294.34 → 5296.84] We're making maybe 2,000 units.
[5297.24 → 5300.28] So splitting that across all these distribution centres
[5300.28 → 5304.64] is just, it's not feasible for us right now.
[5304.70 → 5305.98] Not at our current operating scale.
[5305.98 → 5308.60] And I know it's easy to say, well, your operating scale would probably be better
[5308.60 → 5310.38] if you guys accommodated larger sizes
[5310.38 → 5312.02] and if you had multiple distributions.
[5312.16 → 5313.08] You've got to be careful, though.
[5313.08 → 5315.10] Yeah, but how much investment do I want to take?
[5315.30 → 5316.82] I will say, I will say.
[5316.92 → 5318.26] Do I want to take VC money?
[5318.62 → 5320.78] Do I want that to impact our product development
[5320.78 → 5321.94] and the way we run our business?
[5322.10 → 5322.80] We don't want to do that.
[5323.16 → 5326.82] But I will say, the tall blank shirt is sold out
[5326.82 → 5330.68] in long and short sleeve in every single possible size that we have.
[5330.68 → 5333.80] It's very, very, very strongly rated, five stars.
[5334.12 → 5335.10] The top review on it.
[5335.30 → 5336.44] And I'm going to cut Luke off.
[5336.50 → 5337.62] I actually muted his mic.
[5337.78 → 5338.46] I've muted your mic.
[5339.20 → 5341.20] I'm going to cut Luke off right now
[5341.20 → 5342.88] because I have good news for you.
[5343.58 → 5343.80] Oh.
[5344.52 → 5346.76] When we bring in our new colours of T-shirts,
[5347.08 → 5348.16] which are coming soon,
[5348.20 → 5351.54] I think we've got five new colours of T-shirts, I want to say.
[5352.78 → 5354.88] They will be available in tall sizes.
[5354.96 → 5355.62] Oh, that's cool.
[5355.62 → 5356.50] So not just black.
[5357.10 → 5358.76] But you've got to give us time.
[5359.06 → 5359.56] No, that's awesome.
[5359.66 → 5359.96] That's awesome.
[5360.04 → 5362.18] I'm just, I'm not, I understand it all takes time.
[5362.32 → 5364.94] I'm just saying the most recent review says,
[5365.10 → 5366.22] please bring back more to the store.
[5366.28 → 5367.20] I need 20 of them.
[5367.32 → 5367.66] I know.
[5367.88 → 5368.48] I'm aware.
[5368.62 → 5369.08] I'm aware.
[5370.20 → 5371.96] Frost blade says, yes.
[5373.92 → 5377.90] A lot of people underestimate how small LTT is.
[5378.16 → 5381.00] Yes, it's bigger than the two-person coffee shop in my town.
[5381.14 → 5384.78] But even a company like Critical Role is maybe 10x LTT.
[5384.78 → 5387.32] And even then, they're small compared to something like a Mr. Beast.
[5387.92 → 5394.56] We are, any creator company is insignificant, you know,
[5394.62 → 5396.54] compared to the multinationals.
[5396.82 → 5399.40] And honestly, even then, I see comments all the time that are like,
[5399.44 → 5400.66] how can they not do this?
[5400.72 → 5401.78] They have 100 employees.
[5402.30 → 5405.38] It's like, okay, but do you have any idea how much stuff we do?
[5406.02 → 5407.34] We do so much stuff.
[5407.36 → 5409.54] Like, all of those people are incredibly busy.
[5410.00 → 5410.66] It's not.
[5411.06 → 5413.96] I actually don't know if Critical Role is 10x our size.
[5413.96 → 5416.10] I don't know how big Critical Role is, but I'd be pretty surprised.
[5416.12 → 5417.54] That would be very surprising.
[5417.60 → 5419.30] I was reading the comment verbatim.
[5419.78 → 5423.74] I mean, how many people work at Critical Role?
[5424.58 → 5427.84] I honestly would assume they're smaller, but I don't know.
[5428.02 → 5429.24] Yeah, I have no idea.
[5429.46 → 5432.30] I mean, they have like eight founding members,
[5432.50 → 5437.28] so they definitely have some stuff going on or something.
[5437.28 → 5440.66] Yeah, does anyone know like how many people work there?
[5441.34 → 5443.52] I legitimately have absolutely no idea.
[5445.82 → 5446.74] I'm over it.
[5447.54 → 5447.98] Okay.
[5449.40 → 5450.58] What do you want to talk about next?
[5450.96 → 5451.80] How about another merch message?
[5451.82 → 5452.68] Oh yeah, right, merch messages.
[5453.18 → 5456.04] Celebrating getting a new job at an AWS data centre.
[5456.40 → 5459.30] Coming from IT at a K-12 school district,
[5459.68 → 5463.80] what are the biggest mindset shifts or skills I should focus on for success in a data centre?
[5463.80 → 5468.94] We don't work in a data centre.
[5470.06 → 5471.86] Oh, Critical Role is about our size.
[5472.56 → 5478.08] LinkedIn says 50 to 200 people,
[5478.40 → 5481.52] so they're somewhere in the same kind of neighbourhood as us.
[5481.70 → 5483.00] I don't care.
[5483.46 → 5483.68] Cool.
[5484.62 → 5484.90] Nice.
[5484.90 → 5486.60] What exactly was it?
[5486.70 → 5489.10] They went from teaching, and now they're working in a data centre?
[5489.44 → 5493.88] IT from like elementary high school to working in AWS data centre.
[5493.88 → 5494.60] Ah, okay.
[5494.72 → 5496.42] So IT at a school to...
[5496.42 → 5496.52] Yeah.
[5496.92 → 5498.78] IT for a school district, I should say.
[5502.64 → 5503.64] Man, security.
[5504.56 → 5505.56] Yeah, probably.
[5505.56 → 5508.92] I mean, there's a lot of privacy and security concerns in something like a school,
[5508.92 → 5512.92] but man, compared to the stories you hear people telling about like...
[5513.48 → 5518.68] Man, seriously, going to Equinix and like hearing that there are cages,
[5518.88 → 5521.24] that literally if anybody even touches the outside of them,
[5521.32 → 5522.76] like they have touch sensors on them,
[5523.50 → 5526.62] like the head of security gets a call like immediately.
[5526.86 → 5527.92] It's like that's wild.
[5528.74 → 5530.46] Yeah, I feel like the stakes are going to shift.
[5530.98 → 5531.16] Yeah.
[5531.16 → 5533.26] Like if the TVs in the hallways of the school
[5533.26 → 5535.88] aren't receiving the thing that you're trying to send over them,
[5535.88 → 5538.94] I'm sure somebody's going to be upset about it.
[5540.40 → 5543.56] But now you're working at a data centre that is serving data
[5543.56 → 5546.70] for any number of different types of businesses.
[5549.14 → 5553.44] And it's likely going to be a more intense environment, I suspect.
[5553.96 → 5554.68] I don't know though.
[5554.82 → 5558.06] Like again, neither of us have worked in a data centre.
[5559.04 → 5561.36] Danny says,
[5561.48 → 5563.28] I had to get an FBI background check
[5563.28 → 5565.32] to get a tour of the switch data centre here in Vegas.
[5565.32 → 5567.72] Yeah, like that doesn't surprise me at all.
[5568.42 → 5569.20] I've heard,
[5569.34 → 5571.44] now you're working in the data centre,
[5571.52 → 5572.50] not the software development side.
[5572.58 → 5574.32] I've heard the software development side of AWS
[5574.32 → 5578.02] is quite the meat grinder when it comes to employees.
[5580.20 → 5580.60] So,
[5580.88 → 5582.52] I don't know.
[5582.66 → 5583.32] Keep your head down.
[5585.28 → 5586.08] Dan, one more?
[5586.28 → 5586.90] Yeah, last one.
[5587.28 → 5587.64] Hey DLL,
[5587.84 → 5590.72] I've had my backpack for one and a half years,
[5590.86 → 5593.68] to which my kid and significant other both wanted one,
[5593.68 → 5595.64] which are already under our tree.
[5596.10 → 5598.90] Would you ever sell LTT coloured carabiners
[5598.90 → 5601.26] to help a family differentiate bags?
[5601.36 → 5602.22] That is so funny.
[5602.42 → 5604.32] Do either of you have your LTT backpack on you?
[5604.40 → 5604.62] I do.
[5604.92 → 5606.44] Can I borrow yours for a second, Dan?
[5606.46 → 5607.38] Do you still have your thing on it?
[5607.88 → 5608.46] My thing?
[5608.66 → 5609.32] Yeah, the thing.
[5609.54 → 5609.76] Yeah.
[5609.96 → 5610.66] The name thing?
[5610.80 → 5611.04] Yeah.
[5611.04 → 5612.54] So, here's our solution.
[5613.20 → 5615.44] We gave them away at our Christmas party one year.
[5616.36 → 5618.06] And, here, hold on, Linus cam.
[5618.12 → 5618.50] There we go.
[5619.76 → 5621.78] We put, there we go.
[5622.92 → 5624.18] We put little tags on them,
[5624.52 → 5626.80] with little laser engraved tags with people's names,
[5627.04 → 5630.40] because we did foresee that it was going to be a huge problem,
[5630.76 → 5633.06] that literally everyone in the entire company
[5633.06 → 5635.38] had the same backpack all of a sudden overnight.
[5635.82 → 5636.22] Yep.
[5636.36 → 5636.96] Hasn't really helped.
[5637.62 → 5637.88] Really?
[5638.40 → 5638.82] Not really.
[5638.82 → 5639.78] So, my new solution...
[5639.78 → 5640.94] People just don't look at them, I guess?
[5642.34 → 5643.90] Is to find some little...
[5643.90 → 5644.32] That's heavy.
[5644.46 → 5645.36] You got some stuff in there.
[5645.38 → 5645.70] I know.
[5645.84 → 5646.34] I always do.
[5646.84 → 5649.32] Find some little embellishments or something...
[5649.32 → 5649.74] Accoutrement.
[5649.90 → 5652.08] To hang off of, yeah, to hang off of your poles,
[5652.64 → 5654.28] and to help to differentiate your bag.
[5654.36 → 5656.56] That's really, that's really all you can do.
[5656.88 → 5658.40] I've got my dopamine beaker,
[5658.66 → 5662.40] and I've lost my little whale from LTX.
[5663.04 → 5664.38] I still have the little gold chain,
[5664.44 → 5665.66] but the whale has gone, and I'm sad.
[5665.66 → 5666.98] I've got a couple of things on there.
[5666.98 → 5669.50] The float plane team went on a float plane,
[5670.22 → 5672.18] so I have the luggage tag from when we did that.
[5672.18 → 5672.56] That's pretty cool.
[5672.56 → 5673.22] It's still on my bag.
[5674.04 → 5678.06] And I've got the morphologist,
[5678.56 → 5680.88] the architect Star Citizen guy.
[5681.06 → 5684.36] He gave me a pin for his Star Citizen clan,
[5684.42 → 5685.02] or whatever it is,
[5685.38 → 5686.76] and I have that on my bag,
[5686.80 → 5687.74] because I don't think it looks cool.
[5688.02 → 5690.56] Mine is a Mighty Car Mods lanyard.
[5690.62 → 5691.04] Nice.
[5691.04 → 5692.38] From our recent collab,
[5692.86 → 5697.40] and then I also have my little Linus Sebastian thing.
[5697.50 → 5699.10] I stole that from my full-size backpack.
[5699.28 → 5700.40] Yeah, mine's still on my full-size.
[5700.40 → 5701.52] And this is a snake.
[5702.96 → 5703.32] Yes.
[5703.50 → 5704.78] That my daughter made for me.
[5706.30 → 5708.38] I mean, yeah, it's kind of a snake.
[5708.58 → 5709.04] It's a snake life.
[5710.16 → 5711.00] Put a bird on it.
[5711.04 → 5712.80] Hold on, she actually gave me a new thing
[5712.80 → 5713.84] that I might have lost.
[5713.96 → 5714.78] Uh-oh, bad dad.
[5715.48 → 5715.82] Uh-oh.
[5716.48 → 5717.00] Oh, shoot.
[5717.00 → 5719.04] I might have lost the little lizard she gave me.
[5719.50 → 5720.34] Well, neat.
[5720.92 → 5721.20] Whoops.
[5721.68 → 5722.74] Is there anything important in there?
[5723.08 → 5724.72] Because you're really flopping around.
[5724.82 → 5726.06] Oh, it's all my screwdrivers.
[5726.58 → 5726.86] Oh.
[5727.98 → 5730.06] Yeah, I have like five screwdrivers in there,
[5730.18 → 5732.22] because I put all my different bit sets
[5732.22 → 5733.28] in my different screwdrivers.
[5733.36 → 5734.00] They're all colour-coded.
[5734.30 → 5736.46] Oh, can I do a business pitch to you?
[5737.38 → 5738.20] Live on the show?
[5738.64 → 5740.12] Business pitch, a.k.a. a bitch.
[5743.92 → 5745.04] Yeah, can I do one of those?
[5745.26 → 5745.46] Sure.
[5745.68 → 5746.74] Yeah, you can bitch at me.
[5746.74 → 5747.54] Cool, nice.
[5748.36 → 5750.40] So, Open Sauce was amazing,
[5750.74 → 5752.46] and some of us are going to go again
[5752.46 → 5753.26] just like regardless.
[5753.56 → 5753.66] Yeah.
[5754.38 → 5755.54] But I was thinking,
[5755.68 → 5756.86] it's a maker event.
[5757.30 → 5758.20] What if we had a
[5758.20 → 5759.30] make-your-own-screwdriver booth?
[5761.96 → 5763.04] Don't pitch it to me.
[5763.36 → 5763.56] No?
[5763.86 → 5765.94] No, pitch it to someone else,
[5765.98 → 5767.48] because that is going to be a bitch.
[5767.76 → 5768.06] Is it?
[5768.12 → 5768.86] So what is it?
[5769.00 → 5771.74] Is it, do the machines become a problem,
[5771.92 → 5773.38] or like what are the downsides here?
[5773.88 → 5774.72] Tynan is saying,
[5774.72 → 5775.60] teepee.
[5775.90 → 5777.34] Yeah, I already kind of somewhat.
[5777.76 → 5779.34] So there are a number of issues.
[5779.60 → 5780.44] Issue number one
[5780.44 → 5782.52] is getting the dyed plastics.
[5783.38 → 5784.74] There's minimum order quantities
[5784.74 → 5787.00] often for getting dyes,
[5787.34 → 5789.12] so we cheated on a lot of the ones
[5789.12 → 5789.84] that we had for the
[5789.84 → 5791.46] make-your-own-screwdriver booth at LTX,
[5791.46 → 5792.70] where we were able to piggyback
[5792.70 → 5794.86] on top of the Mega Pro Red
[5794.86 → 5796.52] that they already are buying in bulk,
[5796.64 → 5798.02] and we were going to get a little bit of it
[5798.02 → 5798.58] from them,
[5798.62 → 5799.50] and some other colours.
[5799.50 → 5800.40] They had a blue already
[5800.40 → 5801.86] that we borrowed.
[5802.54 → 5803.36] There were a couple
[5803.36 → 5804.96] where we had to like buy too much dye.
[5805.02 → 5805.72] It goes bad.
[5806.20 → 5807.00] It's like, great.
[5807.16 → 5808.78] And like plastic dye goes bad.
[5808.90 → 5809.52] It's like, okay, sure.
[5809.64 → 5810.62] That sucks.
[5811.32 → 5813.10] Oh, Tynan says it's an excited E.
[5813.28 → 5815.16] Okay, I am not committing to anything.
[5816.14 → 5816.68] So there's all of that.
[5816.70 → 5817.20] It makes sense.
[5817.42 → 5818.34] There's, then,
[5818.48 → 5819.28] there's the like getting
[5819.28 → 5820.42] the production time for it,
[5820.42 → 5821.20] because you're basically,
[5821.54 → 5823.26] you don't know what you're going to make.
[5823.44 → 5823.62] Yeah.
[5823.78 → 5825.68] So you have to make like extra of everything.
[5825.68 → 5827.36] You're going to have a huge bin of garbage
[5827.36 → 5828.20] at the end of it, essentially.
[5828.42 → 5829.34] Well, we made,
[5829.44 → 5831.16] we made lemonade out of garbage
[5831.16 → 5833.24] because we made the mystery screwdriver,
[5833.36 → 5834.40] the random colour screwdriver.
[5834.60 → 5834.98] So that's fine.
[5835.04 → 5835.64] We got rid of it all.
[5835.74 → 5836.28] That's okay.
[5836.32 → 5837.06] We could solve that.
[5837.80 → 5839.34] But the other issue is transportation.
[5839.92 → 5840.70] We have to carry,
[5840.90 → 5842.40] we have no idea what we're going to make.
[5843.08 → 5844.26] Everyone at Open Sauce
[5844.26 → 5846.24] might make an all orange screwdriver.
[5846.94 → 5847.78] We don't know.
[5849.04 → 5851.14] And obviously you can kind of run out of something,
[5851.24 → 5853.22] but if you run out of like half of it,
[5853.26 → 5853.90] that sucks.
[5853.90 → 5856.10] That's taking a W
[5856.10 → 5858.82] and turning it into two L's.
[5858.98 → 5859.88] You know, like that's not,
[5860.24 → 5861.78] that's not good.
[5862.16 → 5863.14] Did you come up with that on spot?
[5863.46 → 5864.42] No, I've used it before,
[5864.42 → 5865.32] but it is a thing.
[5865.38 → 5865.94] It's pretty good.
[5866.02 → 5866.16] Yeah.
[5866.56 → 5868.66] Taking a W and turning it into L's
[5868.66 → 5870.10] or taking two L's
[5870.10 → 5871.00] and turning them into a W.
[5871.22 → 5871.74] I love it.
[5871.92 → 5872.44] That's pretty good.
[5872.84 → 5873.46] So you got to,
[5873.54 → 5875.24] so you got to carry a bunch of stuff down.
[5875.98 → 5876.64] So that's,
[5876.72 → 5877.90] that's a real pain in the butt.
[5878.14 → 5879.58] And otherwise, you know,
[5879.60 → 5880.58] you have people show up at the booth
[5880.58 → 5880.96] and it's like,
[5881.14 → 5882.20] oh yeah, I mean,
[5882.20 → 5883.48] this would be kind of cool.
[5883.48 → 5885.20] You don't want to create,
[5885.20 → 5885.96] doesn't have the right colours for me.
[5885.96 → 5887.18] You don't want to create negative experiences.
[5887.18 → 5888.26] I waited in line now
[5888.26 → 5889.28] and there's none of this left.
[5890.38 → 5892.12] And then there's also the fact that
[5892.12 → 5895.02] that would mean that instead of our cool team
[5895.02 → 5897.24] of cool people
[5897.24 → 5899.40] hanging out with other cool teams
[5899.40 → 5900.16] and cool people,
[5900.30 → 5901.86] they're like manning a booth.
[5902.86 → 5903.26] Which,
[5903.82 → 5904.54] I don't know,
[5904.68 → 5906.12] maybe you guys are super into it
[5906.12 → 5907.32] and you just want to work at a booth
[5907.32 → 5908.02] at Open Sauce,
[5908.10 → 5908.48] but like,
[5908.88 → 5909.38] are you sure?
[5910.38 → 5910.70] Just,
[5910.88 → 5912.92] all I'm asking is that you just think about it.
[5913.10 → 5913.56] Are you sure?
[5913.92 → 5914.12] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5914.20 → 5915.56] Because it's not something that I would,
[5915.74 → 5917.20] that I would assign to people.
[5917.28 → 5917.80] I wouldn't be like,
[5917.86 → 5918.12] oh yeah,
[5918.14 → 5919.66] that show that you really like attending,
[5920.04 → 5921.14] how about you work at it?
[5922.00 → 5923.94] They want us going again anyway.
[5924.30 → 5924.48] Yeah.
[5924.60 → 5925.62] So that's cool.
[5926.18 → 5927.66] So we're going to have some amount of presence there
[5927.66 → 5928.94] regardless when it happens,
[5929.10 → 5929.98] whenever the date is.
[5930.32 → 5930.72] I don't remember.
[5930.94 → 5931.76] Diego San says,
[5931.84 → 5933.30] that's why you have employees.
[5933.52 → 5933.74] Duh.
[5933.74 → 5935.96] I'm talking about the employees.
[5936.88 → 5937.22] The shit,
[5937.22 → 5938.48] the shit doesn't just,
[5938.56 → 5938.82] what?
[5939.00 → 5941.04] Roll down a hill indefinitely.
[5941.22 → 5942.06] At some point,
[5942.14 → 5943.26] somebody has to work.
[5943.36 → 5944.04] What did you say?
[5946.38 → 5947.10] Luke can do it.
[5947.16 → 5947.30] I,
[5947.40 → 5947.64] I,
[5947.64 → 5949.38] I honestly somewhat agree with him.
[5949.44 → 5950.30] I don't want to man the booth.
[5951.70 → 5953.04] I don't want to do that part.
[5953.20 → 5954.46] Maybe for like a little bit.
[5954.52 → 5955.68] I don't want to do it for the whole time.
[5955.70 → 5956.44] Get volunteers to help.
[5956.50 → 5956.60] No,
[5956.64 → 5957.64] you guys don't understand.
[5957.76 → 5959.50] What's so cool about the screwdriver booth
[5959.50 → 5961.66] is you get to talk to the people who designed it.
[5961.74 → 5961.96] Yeah.
[5961.96 → 5963.60] What's cool about the screwdriver booth
[5963.60 → 5965.48] is that they like to know it inside out.
[5965.56 → 5967.18] And what's safe about the screwdriver booth
[5967.18 → 5968.78] is we have people who are really familiar
[5968.78 → 5970.32] with the Arbour presses
[5970.32 → 5972.66] and that can make sure that nobody squashes a finger
[5972.66 → 5973.74] and all that important stuff.
[5976.70 → 5977.18] Yeah.
[5977.34 → 5977.76] So I,
[5977.88 → 5978.22] I,
[5978.26 → 5978.74] I don't know.
[5978.86 → 5979.08] I,
[5979.46 → 5981.04] what I would rather do,
[5981.30 → 5983.12] what I'd rather do in the longer term
[5983.12 → 5984.80] or the medium term
[5984.80 → 5988.48] is figure out how to do like an Xbox controller configurator,
[5988.48 → 5989.30] but for the screwdriver
[5989.30 → 5991.34] where you can just configure your own custom one online.
[5991.96 → 5992.28] Yeah.
[5992.62 → 5994.16] That's where I'd like to get to,
[5994.28 → 5995.04] but we are,
[5995.04 → 5996.14] we can build a configurator.
[5996.24 → 5996.76] No problem.
[5997.10 → 5999.82] But we even have a 3d version of it.
[5999.90 → 6000.94] That's like semi made already.
[6001.02 → 6001.62] Have you seen that?
[6002.16 → 6002.70] I think so.
[6002.72 → 6002.98] Actually,
[6003.10 → 6004.24] the 3d hovering screwdriver
[6004.24 → 6004.64] in a
[6004.70 → 6006.18] in any background environment you want.
[6006.32 → 6007.54] The logistics of it are tough.
[6008.02 → 6008.30] Yeah.
[6008.52 → 6010.00] That part's way harder.
[6010.16 → 6010.40] Yeah,
[6010.50 → 6011.24] for sure.
[6011.32 → 6013.04] Because one of the big challenges
[6013.04 → 6016.06] is that we have to stock the entire ratchet assembly
[6016.06 → 6018.60] with the selector ring on it already.
[6019.06 → 6020.62] If that were not the case,
[6020.86 → 6025.52] it would significantly simplify the lead times of that part
[6025.52 → 6028.96] because we have to have the injection moulding done here.
[6029.18 → 6033.12] Then we have to have it assembled onto the ratchet assembly in China.
[6033.12 → 6035.76] Then we have to have that assembly sent back over here
[6035.76 → 6037.06] for final assembly of the driver.
[6037.06 → 6041.98] And handling that across like six or eight different colours or whatever,
[6042.18 → 6042.64] it's just like,
[6042.88 → 6045.52] but it's going to mean that for extended periods of time,
[6045.52 → 6047.24] you're going to have certain colours out of stock.
[6047.32 → 6047.56] It's just,
[6047.64 → 6050.14] it's a lot of logistics to manage when we're already having trouble
[6050.14 → 6051.56] keeping t-shirts in stock.
[6051.96 → 6052.40] So,
[6052.52 → 6054.98] and that doesn't mean that the team isn't smart
[6054.98 → 6056.16] and doesn't work hard or whatever.
[6056.16 → 6058.70] It just means that the logistics of managing a store
[6058.70 → 6060.92] with like over a thousand SKUs is,
[6061.06 → 6062.20] is really tough.
[6062.66 → 6063.24] It's also like,
[6063.36 → 6063.68] if you,
[6063.68 → 6068.12] if you look at customized versions of products on stores,
[6068.32 → 6070.08] I can think of a couple where like,
[6070.14 → 6070.38] I don't know,
[6070.42 → 6073.38] you can get your name etched onto it or whatever.
[6073.90 → 6075.94] It's usually surprisingly not that cheap.
[6076.26 → 6076.44] Oh,
[6076.68 → 6077.22] oh yeah.
[6077.38 → 6077.48] Oh,
[6077.56 → 6078.00] a hundred percent.
[6078.30 → 6078.64] It's a lot.
[6078.70 → 6079.04] Oh dude,
[6079.12 → 6079.66] we've got,
[6079.88 → 6083.66] we were looking at what the pricing would probably have to be
[6083.66 → 6087.72] if we ever did the resin infused wooden screwdriver
[6087.72 → 6088.50] or the
[6088.58 → 6088.84] sorry,
[6088.94 → 6089.08] yeah,
[6089.08 → 6091.28] the resin infused wood screwdriver.
[6091.28 → 6092.10] Uh,
[6092.10 → 6093.72] and those screwdrivers,
[6093.86 → 6097.50] instead of being like buying a resin infused wooden screwdriver,
[6097.78 → 6100.62] you would probably buy that one.
[6101.58 → 6105.14] And it would probably be listed on the site for like seven,
[6105.30 → 6105.64] 800,
[6105.80 → 6111.96] $900 because realistically it would have to be like hand monitored.
[6111.96 → 6114.32] Like we would take that piece of wood,
[6114.40 → 6115.74] like that one.
[6115.88 → 6118.38] And then we would probably do it here.
[6118.84 → 6123.20] And it would have to be like hand assembled by someone on our engineering team,
[6123.20 → 6125.62] as opposed to just some random or whatever,
[6125.62 → 6127.66] because of still has to meet specs,
[6128.04 → 6128.36] et cetera.
[6128.64 → 6128.76] Yeah.
[6128.78 → 6129.00] And,
[6129.08 → 6130.14] and the cost of,
[6130.24 → 6131.12] of those things,
[6131.12 → 6132.46] like it's like,
[6132.48 → 6135.24] when you look at like knives and stuff that have this resin infused wood in the
[6135.24 → 6136.16] handle and stuff like that,
[6136.20 → 6136.32] they're,
[6136.36 → 6138.94] they're like a thousand dollars there because the
[6139.00 → 6139.94] the getting it is,
[6139.94 → 6143.46] is really expensive on top of all the other complications of making the thing.
[6143.64 → 6144.98] You can't get them at volume.
[6145.32 → 6145.44] Right.
[6145.88 → 6146.32] Um,
[6146.70 → 6151.26] citizen 53 91 says bespoke screwdrivers would go crazy for the whales.
[6151.64 → 6152.38] I know.
[6152.46 → 6152.76] I know.
[6152.76 → 6156.46] I'm sure you could sell like five of basically anything.
[6157.02 → 6157.46] Oh yeah.
[6157.62 → 6157.80] Oh,
[6158.04 → 6158.36] Oh,
[6158.36 → 6158.78] probably.
[6158.94 → 6160.34] It's just a question of like,
[6161.48 → 6161.72] it's,
[6161.76 → 6165.36] it's balancing whether that would even be worth spending our time on,
[6165.40 → 6166.88] like the opportunity cost of it.
[6166.88 → 6167.90] We also have this,
[6168.26 → 6169.50] the whole thing with the store where we're,
[6169.50 → 6173.30] we're trying to make something new and better.
[6173.56 → 6175.12] And while it might be expensive,
[6175.12 → 6175.92] it's perfect.
[6176.02 → 6176.38] And,
[6176.48 → 6177.56] and it's somewhat reasonable.
[6177.80 → 6178.26] That stuff.
[6178.34 → 6180.08] It also has to be somewhat within reason.
[6180.42 → 6180.44] Expensive,
[6180.52 → 6180.98] but reasonable.
[6181.24 → 6181.44] yeah,
[6181.46 → 6182.82] we had a $600 backpack,
[6182.82 → 6186.82] but everyone who bought it was thrilled with the Lux backpack because the
[6186.82 → 6187.72] materials are great.
[6187.96 → 6191.74] It has all the functionality of the regular backpack, and it's a head turner.
[6192.08 → 6192.48] Um,
[6192.48 → 6195.00] like when I was daily driving the Lux backpack,
[6195.56 → 6195.62] dude,
[6195.62 → 6197.02] I saw you get questions about it.
[6197.02 → 6198.00] People are like,
[6198.16 → 6198.62] wow,
[6198.68 → 6199.06] what is that?
[6199.08 → 6201.50] Because not everyone's into it and that's totally fine.
[6201.64 → 6202.72] But the people who like it,
[6202.90 → 6203.44] like it.
[6203.48 → 6204.74] Like one of my friends in Taiwan,
[6204.86 → 6207.10] like badminton buddy tried to buy it off of me.
[6207.34 → 6207.78] And I was like,
[6207.82 → 6207.96] dude,
[6208.02 → 6209.00] this is the only sample.
[6209.08 → 6210.14] Like I have to wear test it.
[6210.18 → 6210.66] You can't,
[6210.90 → 6211.30] he's like,
[6211.34 → 6211.88] what's the
[6211.98 → 6212.64] what's the retail price?
[6212.68 → 6213.66] I'll buy it for full retail price.
[6213.66 → 6213.86] I'm like,
[6213.92 → 6214.00] dude,
[6214.08 → 6214.96] look,
[6215.02 → 6216.40] I would give it to you if I could.
[6216.80 → 6217.94] It's not about the money.
[6218.02 → 6219.08] You just can't have it.
[6219.36 → 6220.82] It's the only one that exists.
[6221.50 → 6221.86] Yeah.
[6222.62 → 6223.06] Um,
[6223.24 → 6224.00] top gear asks,
[6224.06 → 6226.44] have you guys surpassed a million screwdrivers yet?
[6226.52 → 6227.58] Stubby and full size combined?
[6227.74 → 6228.14] No,
[6228.24 → 6228.40] no,
[6228.54 → 6229.34] I think,
[6229.34 → 6233.76] I think we're close to 300,000 or so,
[6234.12 → 6235.06] which is a time,
[6235.32 → 6236.34] which is unbelievable.
[6237.22 → 6237.46] Yeah.
[6237.46 → 6242.72] And I think our Shopify order number is over a million now,
[6242.72 → 6247.92] but I don't think we actually have a million orders because there can be like cancellations and stuff.
[6248.04 → 6248.16] Oh,
[6248.20 → 6248.64] that makes sense.
[6248.68 → 6248.80] Yeah.
[6248.84 → 6249.66] So we're getting,
[6249.66 → 6253.98] we're getting super close to a million orders through Shopify.
[6254.54 → 6254.86] Uh,
[6254.86 → 6255.02] we,
[6255.10 → 6261.10] we apparently are actually like a very sizeable like store for the Shopify platform,
[6261.10 → 6263.04] which is something I never would have thought.
[6263.12 → 6264.84] I never would have thought would happen.
[6265.18 → 6266.66] Citizen 53 91 asks,
[6266.66 → 6267.22] asks,
[6267.32 → 6268.82] how's the gold controller doing?
[6270.32 → 6271.42] It's doing great.
[6271.78 → 6272.14] Appreciating.
[6272.86 → 6273.26] Actually,
[6273.36 → 6273.60] yes.
[6274.62 → 6276.42] If anyone wants to buy it,
[6276.44 → 6279.20] you could buy an appreciating asset.
[6279.62 → 6281.94] I would be very open to selling it.
[6282.04 → 6285.64] I don't actually have any kind of emotional attachment to it.
[6285.72 → 6287.12] It's actually kind of annoying to use.
[6287.24 → 6287.30] Yeah.
[6287.34 → 6288.22] It's not great to use.
[6288.42 → 6289.40] It weighs so much.
[6289.56 → 6289.88] It is.
[6290.04 → 6290.36] It is.
[6290.38 → 6290.80] It's cool.
[6290.88 → 6293.18] And you'll look cool in front of all your cool friends.
[6293.58 → 6293.94] Yeah.
[6294.76 → 6296.20] If you wanted to,
[6296.20 → 6297.18] um,
[6297.72 → 6299.02] yeah,
[6299.06 → 6299.94] if you wanted to,
[6300.00 → 6300.76] I don't even know.
[6300.90 → 6302.56] I have a big and tall label on it.
[6306.36 → 6307.60] I'll engrave a little way.
[6307.84 → 6308.24] Okay.
[6308.76 → 6309.70] I'll engrave away.
[6309.70 → 6310.02] Wow.
[6312.14 → 6312.54] Okay.
[6312.54 → 6321.74] How crazy would it be like to celebrate a million screwdrivers to do like a golden screwdriver or something like that?
[6322.16 → 6322.64] I don't actually,
[6322.78 → 6323.36] I don't even know.
[6323.48 → 6324.08] I don't even know.
[6324.18 → 6325.96] I don't even know if we'd have to wait that long.
[6325.96 → 6326.00] Um,
[6326.00 → 6333.28] I think that doing a golden screwdriver for like 500 K the metal screwdriver launch or something like that would be kind of cool.
[6333.38 → 6333.62] Wait,
[6333.70 → 6333.88] what?
[6334.08 → 6334.30] Oh,
[6334.32 → 6335.16] you mean to sell it?
[6335.26 → 6335.38] No,
[6335.38 → 6336.12] one's going to buy it.
[6336.20 → 6336.30] No,
[6336.36 → 6336.46] no,
[6336.46 → 6336.60] no,
[6336.60 → 6336.72] no,
[6336.72 → 6336.82] no,
[6336.82 → 6336.88] no,
[6336.88 → 6336.90] no,
[6336.90 → 6336.92] no,
[6336.92 → 6337.52] no,
[6337.52 → 6337.62] no,
[6337.62 → 6337.74] no,
[6337.74 → 6338.34] no,
[6338.34 → 6338.42] no,
[6338.42 → 6338.44] no,
[6338.44 → 6338.52] no,
[6338.52 → 6338.62] no,
[6338.62 → 6339.02] no,
[6339.02 → 6339.04] no,
[6339.04 → 6339.54] no,
[6339.54 → 6339.62] no,
[6339.62 → 6339.64] no,
[6339.64 → 6339.74] no,
[6339.74 → 6339.84] no,
[6339.84 → 6339.92] no,
[6339.92 → 6340.46] no,
[6340.46 → 6340.52] no,
[6340.52 → 6341.46] no,
[6341.46 → 6341.78] no,
[6341.78 → 6342.46] no,
[6342.46 → 6342.48] no,
[6342.48 → 6342.50] no,
[6342.50 → 6343.74] anyway,
[6344.74 → 6345.54] what are we supposed to be doing,
[6345.62 → 6345.74] Dan?
[6346.18 → 6346.62] Topics.
[6347.14 → 6352.22] HP downgrades printer features when you don't buy genuine ink.
[6352.22 → 6355.72] According to a post on r slash asshole design,
[6356.26 → 6369.02] an HP printer owner named Mitch had multiple features of his desk jet 2700 removed or revoked because he lost his HP plus benefits when he installed non HP replacement ink in his printer.
[6369.02 → 6382.50] Some HP plus benefits include cloud based printing, automatic updates and fixes, improved print quality, advanced scanning features, extended warranty, and enhanced security features.
[6383.54 → 6397.92] Now, HP's version of this is that HP plus is a free upgrade available on many HP printers when you set up an HP account, use genuine HP ink cartridges, and keep your printer connected to the internet.
[6399.02 → 6402.98] Additional benefits include the optional HP instant ink.
[6404.24 → 6404.68] Oh,
[6404.80 → 6409.96] so you pick a plan based on how often you print, not how much ink you use starting at $189 a month for 10 pages.
[6410.16 → 6410.98] Oh, that whole thing.
[6411.04 → 6412.42] Is that still a thing?
[6412.88 → 6413.60] I guess.
[6415.38 → 6415.82] See,
[6416.06 → 6418.12] you don't get to just spin,
[6418.80 → 6419.16] you know,
[6419.46 → 6420.68] you can't just spin.
[6421.04 → 6422.06] You can't say,
[6422.42 → 6422.68] hey,
[6423.14 → 6427.34] it's an upgrade if you do all this stuff.
[6427.34 → 6428.18] No,
[6428.32 → 6428.82] it's not.
[6428.88 → 6431.74] It's a downgrade if you don't do all this stuff.
[6431.78 → 6432.90] You have a gun to my head.
[6432.96 → 6433.68] This is a stick,
[6433.80 → 6434.42] not a carrot.
[6436.20 → 6436.56] Ugh.
[6439.06 → 6439.46] Ugh.
[6441.06 → 6441.46] Brutal.
[6443.06 → 6444.92] $1.89 a month.
[6445.04 → 6445.68] Cue you.
[6445.82 → 6446.88] Not $189.
[6447.46 → 6447.78] Oh,
[6447.88 → 6448.24] you just,
[6449.06 → 6450.26] Luke's on it in the chat.
[6450.40 → 6451.54] Just 100% believable.
[6452.00 → 6453.62] I don't know what to say about that other than,
[6453.62 → 6454.88] I was just like,
[6454.94 → 6456.38] that sounds about right for HP.
[6456.66 → 6457.02] Brutal.
[6457.44 → 6458.50] Let's move on to our next one.
[6458.56 → 6460.14] Somebody found our geocache.
[6460.22 → 6460.54] Yeah.
[6460.78 → 6462.24] At the end of Tuesday's video,
[6462.42 → 6462.54] oh,
[6462.58 → 6462.98] our original,
[6463.12 → 6463.24] here,
[6463.34 → 6463.86] we might as well,
[6463.90 → 6464.84] we might as well show the
[6465.54 → 6465.82] hey,
[6466.92 → 6467.86] they found it,
[6467.90 → 6468.78] and they look exactly,
[6469.44 → 6469.98] genuine smiles,
[6470.16 → 6473.08] exactly as wet as I would expect them to look.
[6473.38 → 6476.90] So that has a $500 LTT store gift card on it,
[6476.90 → 6477.56] or something like that,
[6477.56 → 6477.86] I think.
[6478.52 → 6479.88] So this was really cool.
[6479.96 → 6481.10] At the end of Tuesday's video,
[6481.18 → 6483.42] the most expensive USB drive on earth,
[6483.86 → 6484.32] per gig,
[6484.66 → 6489.24] we revealed that we'd hidden that ferroelectric USB drive in a geocached somewhere in the Vancouver,
[6489.36 → 6489.86] BC area,
[6490.06 → 6492.14] with $500 of coupon codes on it,
[6492.20 → 6493.60] and we left clue throughout the video.
[6494.14 → 6496.66] A flurry of activity in the comments,
[6496.74 → 6497.14] our forums,
[6497.24 → 6497.94] and Reddit followed,
[6498.20 → 6500.64] and the device was found about six hours later,
[6500.86 → 6503.08] near a geocached in Port Coquitlam.
[6503.84 → 6505.58] Here is the solution.
[6505.98 → 6508.02] If you don't want spoilers,
[6508.12 → 6509.68] and you want to try to solve it for yourself,
[6509.86 → 6510.98] by watching the video,
[6511.06 → 6512.24] you can totally do that.
[6512.66 → 6514.60] I'll put both hands up when you're good to tune in again.
[6514.64 → 6515.08] There you go.
[6516.78 → 6517.18] First,
[6517.38 → 6520.52] the video had four quarters of a QR code hidden in it.
[6520.90 → 6523.12] Connor was responsible for hiding the QR codes,
[6523.16 → 6524.12] and he determined the spots.
[6524.22 → 6525.44] The timestamps are 502,
[6525.58 → 6526.20] 543,
[6526.40 → 6527.40] 643-ish,
[6527.46 → 6528.68] it's a single frame,
[6528.96 → 6530.84] and 1012 in the outro.
[6531.34 → 6533.38] Once you assembled the pieces of the QR code,
[6533.38 → 6535.86] it led you to a picture of a broken fence.
[6536.30 → 6538.06] The fence was a rail fence,
[6538.20 → 6539.58] which references the cipher
[6539.58 → 6543.36] used to encode the text surrounding the QR code.
[6543.64 → 6545.88] Since the fence in the image had three rails,
[6546.26 → 6548.14] so did the rail fence cipher.
[6549.24 → 6551.98] I added space and line breaks to the encoded message,
[6552.04 → 6553.52] which makes things a bit more difficult.
[6553.76 → 6555.74] I did not include an offset.
[6555.74 → 6558.72] So here's an example of a rail fence cipher.
[6561.64 → 6563.40] Was this Connor's idea?
[6563.48 → 6564.22] Because this was sick.
[6565.52 → 6565.96] No,
[6566.04 → 6568.64] I believe this would have been Adam working on this.
[6569.12 → 6569.60] Good job.
[6570.32 → 6572.20] I had intended to have an extra step
[6572.20 → 6574.74] using another ciphered message within the rail fence cipher.
[6574.96 → 6576.02] The next hint would have been
[6576.02 → 6576.48] liberty,
[6576.84 → 6577.16] freedom,
[6577.48 → 6578.08] tyranny is dead,
[6578.20 → 6579.60] a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar
[6579.60 → 6582.74] to indicate that the next code was using a simple Caesar cipher.
[6583.20 → 6583.66] A to B,
[6583.72 → 6584.10] B to C,
[6584.20 → 6584.60] C to D,
[6584.60 → 6585.00] etc.
[6585.94 → 6587.50] Even when only a portion of the message
[6587.50 → 6588.62] had two layers of encryption,
[6588.82 → 6590.32] it made it very hard to know
[6590.32 → 6591.30] if you were on the right path.
[6591.64 → 6591.92] Also,
[6592.20 → 6593.76] I ran out of time to make it more complex,
[6593.82 → 6594.42] so we didn't do that.
[6594.60 → 6594.78] Instead,
[6594.90 → 6596.42] I just included the name of a geocached
[6596.42 → 6598.70] that could be found near where I stashed the drive.
[6598.94 → 6601.16] To avoid too much disruption to to geocache,
[6601.22 → 6602.80] I didn't actually hide the drive inside of it,
[6602.88 → 6603.58] just nearby.
[6604.04 → 6605.38] To get the exact coordinates,
[6605.50 → 6607.48] you just had to solve the geocache puzzle,
[6607.60 → 6608.80] which I will not spoil here.
[6610.16 → 6610.80] Adam says,
[6610.80 → 6612.40] I did my best to be hands-off,
[6612.50 → 6613.64] but did end up providing hints
[6613.64 → 6615.16] by reacting to comments on the forums
[6615.16 → 6617.66] when it seemed like people were getting really far off,
[6618.00 → 6619.62] like thinking that we hit an Ender bee,
[6619.92 → 6621.56] or started calling phone numbers.
[6622.06 → 6622.46] Adam.
[6622.72 → 6623.24] Oh, boy.
[6623.34 → 6623.80] Yeah, okay.
[6623.90 → 6624.48] That makes sense.
[6624.56 → 6627.08] Congrats to Redditor Betty Brett and her husband.
[6627.20 → 6628.80] It was great to see the teamwork of the community.
[6628.80 → 6630.90] Many viewers outside the Vancouver area
[6630.90 → 6632.62] were helping out those who were close enough
[6632.62 → 6633.68] to have a chance at the prize.
[6634.02 → 6636.28] We did manage to generate some mild controversy
[6636.28 → 6637.64] in the geocache community.
[6638.66 → 6640.90] Geocaches are created by community members
[6640.90 → 6643.00] and are meant to be done for the fun of it,
[6643.12 → 6644.54] rather than for any sort of prize.
[6644.66 → 6647.52] And introducing a bunch of armies to any hobby
[6647.52 → 6649.20] is usually met with a bit of resistance,
[6649.74 → 6652.36] as new folks might not understand the culture
[6652.36 → 6653.24] or best practices.
[6653.24 → 6656.24] Some people did point out
[6656.24 → 6658.40] that plugging in random USB sticks is a bad idea.
[6658.50 → 6659.30] You don't know what's on it.
[6659.38 → 6660.02] In this case,
[6661.44 → 6665.04] I really doubt that someone was able to find it,
[6665.12 → 6665.74] flash the firmware,
[6666.00 → 6667.92] program something malicious to put on the USB drive,
[6667.96 → 6669.32] then put it back where it was supposed to be.
[6669.32 → 6669.66] It is possible.
[6669.76 → 6671.48] It is possible, however, very unlikely.
[6671.64 → 6673.12] I'd also be surprised if someone decided
[6673.12 → 6674.90] to purchase similar-looking USB keys
[6674.90 → 6675.92] with malicious stuff on them
[6675.92 → 6677.00] and litter them around geocaches
[6677.00 → 6677.58] in the lower mainland.
[6678.62 → 6680.26] It's like needles and candy apples.
[6680.26 → 6682.08] It's not really a thing that actually happens,
[6682.08 → 6683.26] except when it does happen.
[6684.04 → 6685.96] So, yes, that is a perfect point,
[6686.08 → 6689.00] but it was also a very distinctive-looking USB drive
[6689.00 → 6690.92] with very distinctive functionality,
[6691.12 → 6693.26] like you...
[6693.26 → 6694.74] Yes, good point.
[6694.76 → 6695.60] It would have been tough.
[6695.76 → 6696.46] But also...
[6696.46 → 6697.08] Very, very unlikely.
[6697.20 → 6700.94] The level of gatekeeping that was going on
[6700.94 → 6703.78] with a couple of members of the geocache community
[6703.78 → 6705.70] was actually comical.
[6705.88 → 6706.14] Yeah.
[6706.82 → 6708.72] And you all need to calm down.
[6708.72 → 6710.76] But yeah, it was fun.
[6711.26 → 6711.70] It was fun.
[6711.78 → 6713.46] We had a lot of fun with it,
[6713.70 → 6717.68] and the team has a lot of fun creating content like that.
[6717.92 → 6721.08] I saw a lot of people that were angry
[6721.08 → 6723.90] about the sort of detective interrogation
[6723.90 → 6726.98] and the lawyer conversational skit
[6726.98 → 6728.16] that took place in the video.
[6728.82 → 6730.90] And anyone who said it wasn't their cup of tea,
[6731.02 → 6732.00] I kind of noted that,
[6732.06 → 6733.76] and anyone who got furious about it
[6733.76 → 6736.18] is now officially shadow-banned from the channel forever
[6736.18 → 6738.76] because, guys, we got to do stuff.
[6738.90 → 6739.82] Don't get mad.
[6739.94 → 6741.10] Just express your thoughts.
[6741.20 → 6742.60] It's so exhausting sometimes.
[6742.82 → 6745.16] Dude, our comment section is legitimately...
[6745.16 → 6745.94] It's getting better.
[6746.74 → 6747.82] Like, way better.
[6748.04 → 6748.24] It is.
[6748.24 → 6750.56] I don't know whether it's the threat of shadow-banning
[6750.56 → 6753.02] or that it was just a very...
[6753.02 → 6754.92] Because I haven't actually done it to that many people.
[6755.50 → 6757.76] Or whether it was just a very small number
[6757.76 → 6759.48] that were creating...
[6759.48 → 6760.16] As far as my understanding goes...
[6760.16 → 6762.24] The vast majority of the nonsense.
[6762.44 → 6764.22] A lot of these are actually very small numbers.
[6764.64 → 6765.04] Oh, yeah.
[6765.26 → 6765.64] Like, it's...
[6765.64 → 6767.28] A lot of communities are often ruined
[6767.28 → 6769.18] by a very small group of people.
[6769.22 → 6769.36] Yeah.
[6769.48 → 6772.22] Because it doesn't take much to taint the bunch.
[6772.72 → 6773.60] Nope, it really doesn't.
[6773.60 → 6774.06] It's a big part of the problem.
[6774.08 → 6774.68] And you know what?
[6774.96 → 6777.12] I had an interesting conversation
[6777.12 → 6779.50] at the Smash Champs, the badminton club,
[6779.60 → 6780.98] at the Smash Champs Christmas party.
[6780.98 → 6783.40] I now have to attend multiple Christmas parties.
[6783.56 → 6784.72] I'm running too many companies.
[6784.84 → 6786.20] It's a very relatable problem, I know.
[6786.74 → 6788.58] So we had a fascinating conversation
[6788.58 → 6791.20] because they finally dug up a data point
[6791.20 → 6792.30] that I'd been asking for.
[6792.60 → 6794.48] And you know how I can never turn off work.
[6794.56 → 6795.44] So we're at a Christmas party.
[6795.50 → 6796.10] We're talking about work.
[6796.16 → 6797.76] Anyway, the point is that
[6797.76 → 6800.68] because we've been offering it for free,
[6800.88 → 6804.08] we've had free drop-in for our soft opening,
[6804.32 → 6807.26] there have been people who have been signing up
[6807.26 → 6809.22] and then not showing up
[6809.22 → 6811.60] because there are no consequences for not showing up.
[6812.12 → 6813.00] And what we discovered,
[6813.24 → 6816.90] that there was a group of repeat offenders
[6816.90 → 6820.14] who had done it over 30 times
[6820.14 → 6822.38] in a span of just a couple of months
[6822.38 → 6823.36] that we've been soft open.
[6823.82 → 6825.40] And so we were having a conversation
[6825.40 → 6829.40] about what our reaction should be
[6829.40 → 6830.32] to something like that.
[6830.70 → 6833.46] And the team, I want to get out ahead of this,
[6833.46 → 6836.24] the team already made their case
[6836.24 → 6838.66] and I gave in, I gave in.
[6839.00 → 6841.72] They said they wanted to give a warning to these people
[6841.72 → 6844.38] before issuing any kind of suspension
[6844.38 → 6846.02] or anything like that.
[6846.38 → 6849.26] But what I told them I wanted to do
[6849.26 → 6853.80] was just permanently ban them forever.
[6854.92 → 6856.34] Because doing something like,
[6856.46 → 6859.16] missing a booked session once in a while,
[6859.44 → 6860.04] that happens.
[6860.28 → 6861.00] It's going to happen.
[6861.00 → 6861.52] That happens.
[6861.72 → 6861.90] Yep.
[6862.12 → 6864.10] Doing it dozens of times
[6864.10 → 6865.24] over a span of...
[6865.24 → 6865.98] 30 times?
[6866.02 → 6867.64] Over a span of a couple of months.
[6867.76 → 6868.10] Yeah.
[6868.58 → 6870.48] Knowing that by booking the session,
[6870.72 → 6872.90] somebody else can't sign up for it
[6872.90 → 6874.52] because it's a limited number of slots.
[6875.06 → 6877.74] That just means you're an f***ING a**hole.
[6877.82 → 6878.60] And if they're going to do that,
[6878.64 → 6879.28] what else are they going to do?
[6879.30 → 6879.68] What else are they gonna...
[6879.68 → 6880.56] I just don't want them around.
[6880.56 → 6881.60] Do they really want them on your course?
[6881.60 → 6882.54] And here are the numbers.
[6884.06 → 6885.58] 2.5%.
[6885.58 → 6890.72] It was 2.5% of the total people
[6890.72 → 6891.86] who have come to play
[6891.86 → 6894.00] that were engaging in this sort of
[6894.00 → 6897.28] egregious level of abuse
[6897.28 → 6898.56] of our online booking system.
[6899.74 → 6900.24] And...
[6900.24 → 6901.16] Would you let people appeal?
[6902.20 → 6902.76] Why?
[6903.40 → 6903.66] Yeah.
[6904.12 → 6904.46] Why?
[6904.80 → 6905.12] Yeah.
[6906.24 → 6906.78] No.
[6907.06 → 6907.32] Why?
[6908.08 → 6908.96] Give me a good reason.
[6908.96 → 6910.54] That many times is tough
[6910.54 → 6912.70] because that means you spent a month
[6912.70 → 6913.32] in the...
[6913.32 → 6913.88] How long?
[6914.00 → 6914.46] Two months?
[6915.06 → 6915.68] How long has it been open?
[6915.80 → 6915.98] Yeah.
[6915.98 → 6916.70] Like two, two and a half months.
[6916.72 → 6917.42] So you spent half of the time
[6917.42 → 6918.30] since it's been open
[6918.30 → 6919.76] booking and not showing up.
[6919.86 → 6920.04] Yeah.
[6920.06 → 6921.08] So like, you know,
[6921.18 → 6924.12] maybe you have a slew of unfortunate events
[6924.12 → 6925.72] and you end up not making like
[6925.72 → 6926.90] a few in a row even
[6926.90 → 6928.46] and it like looks kind of bad
[6928.46 → 6928.76] and you're like,
[6928.82 → 6929.80] yeah, like I just...
[6929.80 → 6931.16] I wasn't trying to be a jerk
[6931.16 → 6932.22] and I thought I could go
[6932.22 → 6932.76] and then, you know,
[6932.82 → 6934.40] just life is messed up right now
[6934.40 → 6934.74] and it just...
[6934.74 → 6935.22] Yeah, I get it.
[6935.24 → 6935.82] ...kept not working.
[6936.44 → 6936.88] But...
[6936.88 → 6939.92] Spending a month
[6939.92 → 6942.16] out of two to two and a half months
[6942.16 → 6943.72] doing that is too much.
[6943.90 → 6944.10] Yeah.
[6944.22 → 6945.28] Chris 429 says,
[6945.34 → 6946.12] honestly, it's crazy
[6946.12 → 6947.64] that 2% of the time you've been open
[6947.64 → 6948.64] you couldn't rent that space.
[6948.66 → 6949.20] That's crazy.
[6949.52 → 6950.98] That's not how that math works.
[6951.34 → 6952.34] The way the math works
[6952.34 → 6953.30] is that if you have
[6953.30 → 6954.88] two and a half percent
[6954.88 → 6956.74] of the people...
[6956.74 → 6957.38] It's of the people.
[6957.38 → 6958.62] ...that have come and played
[6958.62 → 6961.50] doing this 30 plus times,
[6961.72 → 6962.84] we would have sessions
[6962.84 → 6964.32] that are fully booked
[6964.32 → 6965.84] and have like a third
[6965.84 → 6966.52] of the people there
[6966.52 → 6967.38] because two thirds
[6967.38 → 6968.18] of them weren't there.
[6968.80 → 6970.86] That's what this kind
[6970.86 → 6972.98] of egregious repeat offending
[6972.98 → 6974.40] does to a community.
[6974.54 → 6975.28] It destroys it.
[6975.68 → 6976.34] Yeah, it actually...
[6976.34 → 6977.52] Yeah, it makes it less interesting.
[6977.80 → 6978.60] And when there's fewer people there,
[6978.64 → 6979.18] it's less interesting.
[6979.60 → 6979.82] Yep.
[6980.04 → 6981.66] Because in my limited experience
[6981.66 → 6982.44] with badminton people,
[6982.52 → 6984.00] you'll kind of jump the courts
[6984.00 → 6984.80] a little bit sometimes.
[6985.04 → 6985.52] Yeah, absolutely.
[6985.52 → 6986.38] Go play with other people,
[6986.54 → 6986.86] do whatever.
[6986.98 → 6987.94] Yeah, especially during drop-in.
[6988.16 → 6989.18] Yeah, it's very much
[6989.18 → 6989.86] a community thing.
[6989.96 → 6991.82] So having such a reduction
[6991.82 → 6992.48] in the amount of people
[6992.48 → 6993.34] that are there can be bad.
[6993.34 → 6994.66] Azania says,
[6994.80 → 6995.34] there has to be some
[6995.34 → 6996.22] advanced payment for booking.
[6996.36 → 6997.04] Yes, yes.
[6997.16 → 6999.88] And once we're taking payment,
[7000.06 → 7000.88] absolutely there will be,
[7000.92 → 7001.72] but we're soft open.
[7002.06 → 7002.96] And we wanted people
[7002.96 → 7003.76] to be able to come
[7003.76 → 7004.44] and try the courts
[7004.44 → 7006.50] and enjoy some free badminton.
[7006.66 → 7008.12] I mean, this is why
[7008.12 → 7009.26] we can't have nice things.
[7009.54 → 7010.72] We actually were trying
[7010.72 → 7012.08] to like to do a solid.
[7012.58 → 7013.80] Obviously, there's an advantage
[7013.80 → 7014.98] for our business, right?
[7015.08 → 7016.76] Like we're giving people
[7016.76 → 7018.62] that first hit, you know?
[7018.62 → 7018.82] Smash.
[7020.66 → 7020.98] Smash.
[7021.40 → 7023.30] Yeah, the first smash, right?
[7023.42 → 7023.60] Yeah.
[7023.74 → 7027.80] But like, yeah, like,
[7027.94 → 7028.54] I don't know.
[7028.62 → 7029.34] Yeah, so obviously
[7029.34 → 7030.18] we're going to figure it out,
[7030.22 → 7030.88] but no, it was free.
[7031.08 → 7032.12] So people were taking
[7032.12 → 7032.94] a free thing.
[7033.98 → 7035.32] And so it was like
[7035.32 → 7037.10] the 2% of people
[7037.10 → 7038.48] were showing up at the door
[7038.48 → 7039.80] where the bowl of candy is out.
[7039.88 → 7040.78] Please take just one.
[7041.12 → 7042.22] And just taking all of them.
[7043.04 → 7044.18] Ruining it for everybody.
[7045.86 → 7046.26] Brutal.
[7046.26 → 7050.10] So yeah, I don't know.
[7050.20 → 7052.10] I just, I just,
[7052.52 → 7053.64] my state of mind,
[7053.76 → 7054.60] Yvonne disagreed.
[7054.74 → 7056.54] She supported the Smash team
[7056.54 → 7057.88] and, you know,
[7057.98 → 7059.38] they ultimately have decided
[7059.38 → 7060.22] to issue a warning
[7060.22 → 7060.98] to all these people.
[7061.20 → 7061.78] And even that,
[7061.84 → 7063.02] it's like a manual process.
[7063.14 → 7064.68] It's creating unnecessary work
[7064.68 → 7065.02] for us.
[7065.02 → 7065.18] Yep.
[7065.56 → 7066.96] To go and like to tell them
[7066.96 → 7068.60] to not be an f***ING a**hole.
[7068.92 → 7069.24] Right?
[7069.36 → 7069.98] Like, why?
[7070.60 → 7072.06] So they're going to do it.
[7072.10 → 7072.58] They're going to do it.
[7072.58 → 7073.40] We're going to give them
[7073.40 → 7074.04] a warning or whatever.
[7074.16 → 7075.42] But honestly, I'm not,
[7075.42 → 7076.50] I don't support that.
[7076.68 → 7077.44] I think we should just
[7077.44 → 7078.10] not bother with it.
[7078.10 → 7078.48] I don't need them.
[7079.14 → 7080.82] I'll take the other 97.5%
[7080.82 → 7081.68] of good eggs.
[7081.92 → 7082.12] Yeah.
[7082.24 → 7082.88] Because most,
[7082.88 → 7083.14] I don't think you're going to have
[7083.14 → 7083.74] an attendance problem.
[7083.96 → 7085.78] Most people are pretty awesome.
[7086.74 → 7088.08] Most people are pretty chill.
[7089.52 → 7090.00] It just takes,
[7090.26 → 7091.44] so that was what I thought
[7091.44 → 7091.92] was interesting.
[7092.00 → 7092.68] It was that number.
[7093.32 → 7094.34] Two and a half percent
[7094.34 → 7095.30] was the number of people
[7095.30 → 7096.84] who were just egregiously
[7096.84 → 7098.28] just jackasses.
[7098.34 → 7099.30] I bet you it's really
[7099.30 → 7100.26] not that far off
[7100.26 → 7101.98] for like most things.
[7101.98 → 7102.28] Most things.
[7102.56 → 7102.80] Yep.
[7103.26 → 7103.48] Yep.
[7103.48 → 7104.10] Genuinely.
[7104.84 → 7105.04] Yep.
[7105.08 → 7106.00] Like looking at communities
[7106.00 → 7106.98] that I've modded before
[7106.98 → 7107.42] and stuff,
[7107.54 → 7107.80] it's like,
[7107.88 → 7109.34] it's really a small.
[7109.42 → 7110.18] Sitting in a theatre
[7110.18 → 7110.92] watching a movie.
[7111.86 → 7113.82] It's only like two people
[7113.82 → 7115.32] that won't shut up
[7115.32 → 7116.50] or have their phone on
[7116.50 → 7116.88] or whatever.
[7117.10 → 7117.26] Yeah.
[7117.64 → 7118.04] Apparently,
[7118.16 → 7118.92] I was reading an article
[7118.92 → 7119.34] about this.
[7119.38 → 7119.88] Is this true?
[7120.48 → 7120.88] Apparently,
[7121.16 → 7122.26] disruptions in movie theatres
[7122.26 → 7122.90] are becoming like
[7122.90 → 7124.14] way more of a thing.
[7124.56 → 7124.76] Yeah,
[7124.76 → 7125.48] because people aren't used
[7125.48 → 7126.56] to not being on their phone.
[7126.86 → 7127.98] So they'll just be on their phone
[7127.98 → 7128.52] the whole time.
[7129.32 → 7129.60] What?
[7129.92 → 7130.28] Yeah.
[7130.28 → 7132.28] That's crazy.
[7133.04 → 7133.36] Yeah.
[7134.04 → 7135.20] And they don't do anything?
[7135.28 → 7135.72] They don't just like
[7135.72 → 7136.56] kick these people out?
[7136.64 → 7137.24] I guess not.
[7137.36 → 7138.68] Like that's the thing
[7138.68 → 7139.98] that really blows me away
[7139.98 → 7142.16] because as the proprietor
[7142.16 → 7142.78] of the business,
[7142.78 → 7144.52] I feel like it's my job
[7144.52 → 7146.00] to ensure that my customers
[7146.00 → 7146.94] have a good time.
[7147.22 → 7148.48] And I don't care
[7148.48 → 7149.86] about one person
[7149.86 → 7151.66] if they are impacting
[7151.66 → 7153.20] the other 99
[7153.20 → 7154.70] that are not able
[7154.70 → 7156.74] to enjoy my facility.
[7156.88 → 7158.12] I am wondering a little bit,
[7158.16 → 7159.62] like I've heard this as well.
[7159.62 → 7160.54] You've heard this.
[7160.64 → 7161.52] I've heard this.
[7161.82 → 7162.58] Neither of us really go
[7162.58 → 7163.48] to movies that often anymore
[7163.48 → 7164.38] so we haven't experienced it.
[7164.48 → 7164.88] Is this,
[7165.10 → 7166.28] we're all hearing about it
[7166.28 → 7167.40] or have people in the chat
[7167.40 → 7168.66] actually genuinely
[7168.66 → 7169.50] experienced this?
[7169.72 → 7170.94] Because like Elijah said,
[7171.50 → 7172.18] yeah,
[7172.28 → 7172.86] people cheering,
[7172.98 → 7173.70] it's so true,
[7173.80 → 7174.86] people cheering sometimes also.
[7174.98 → 7176.02] Is this from Elijah
[7176.02 → 7177.04] going to the theatre
[7177.04 → 7177.92] or are you hearing this?
[7177.98 → 7178.66] There's no way Elijah
[7178.66 → 7179.48] ever went to a theatre.
[7180.46 → 7180.96] No way.
[7182.04 → 7183.00] And Elijah says
[7183.00 → 7184.02] it's hard to kick people out.
[7184.08 → 7184.74] It's a bigger disturbance
[7184.74 → 7185.16] to do that
[7185.16 → 7186.46] than to let them be annoying.
[7186.62 → 7186.84] No.
[7187.24 → 7187.82] No, no, no, no, no.
[7187.82 → 7188.58] That's the thing.
[7188.58 → 7190.86] Because you only have to
[7190.86 → 7191.98] kick them out one time.
[7192.28 → 7193.44] They will be a disturbance
[7193.44 → 7194.84] forever.
[7196.56 → 7197.28] You go to a theatre
[7197.28 → 7197.98] once a month.
[7198.18 → 7198.38] Wow.
[7198.64 → 7199.02] Oh, really?
[7199.82 → 7200.52] Well, then why haven't you
[7200.52 → 7201.52] ever seen any movies?
[7203.34 → 7204.70] What are you even doing there?
[7204.76 → 7204.84] You've seen all the
[7204.84 → 7205.66] modern bad ones?
[7206.36 → 7207.36] I don't know, man.
[7211.32 → 7212.24] Maybe just theatres.
[7212.36 → 7212.90] The staff is just
[7212.90 → 7213.74] a person for popcorn.
[7213.92 → 7214.02] Yeah.
[7214.28 → 7215.22] Dude, I don't know.
[7215.22 → 7216.98] As a moviegoer,
[7217.02 → 7217.62] and I used to manage
[7217.62 → 7218.64] one in the 2010s,
[7219.26 → 7220.26] there's way more
[7220.26 → 7221.08] talking during the movie
[7221.08 → 7222.00] and phone usage
[7222.00 → 7223.48] than there used to be.
[7223.58 → 7224.10] Yeah, okay.
[7224.46 → 7225.30] Avid moviegoer.
[7225.38 → 7225.90] Oh, okay, yeah.
[7226.30 → 7227.00] Yeah, apparently
[7227.00 → 7227.76] it's more of a thing.
[7231.04 → 7231.36] Huh.
[7231.76 → 7232.08] Okay.
[7232.96 → 7233.90] I don't know, dude.
[7237.90 → 7238.26] Okay.
[7238.44 → 7239.08] I think that's because
[7239.08 → 7239.54] it's the new
[7239.54 → 7240.28] Lord of the Rings movie,
[7240.42 → 7240.60] Conrad.
[7241.94 → 7242.96] That's my take on it.
[7242.96 → 7244.04] What is?
[7244.04 → 7245.20] He said nobody goes anymore.
[7245.36 → 7245.94] We went to go see
[7245.94 → 7246.96] the new Lord of the Rings movie
[7246.96 → 7248.04] and there's only five people there.
[7248.68 → 7249.80] What new Lord of the Rings movie?
[7251.20 → 7251.90] Is there a new
[7251.90 → 7252.90] Lord of the Rings movie?
[7253.04 → 7253.54] I don't know,
[7253.62 → 7254.20] which is the whole
[7254.20 → 7254.24] part of the problem.
[7254.24 → 7255.06] What are you talking about?
[7255.06 → 7255.68] The whole part of the problem.
[7255.70 → 7256.18] There's no new
[7256.18 → 7257.12] Lord of the Rings movie.
[7257.24 → 7257.82] No, you're drunk.
[7258.84 → 7259.58] Hold on, what?
[7260.12 → 7260.48] No.
[7263.68 → 7265.14] Oh, animated movie.
[7265.14 → 7265.68] Animated movie.
[7266.14 → 7266.86] The War Within.
[7267.68 → 7268.82] Oh, I don't know if it's not.
[7268.94 → 7269.70] Not The War Within.
[7269.88 → 7271.56] The War of the Cherrim.
[7271.56 → 7276.04] Is this actually based on anything
[7276.04 → 7277.38] Tolkien wrote or is this just
[7277.38 → 7280.04] going to have final season
[7280.04 → 7281.14] of Game of Thrones syndrome?
[7283.48 → 7283.92] Plot.
[7284.90 → 7286.68] 183 years before the events.
[7286.84 → 7288.34] It's animated and not promoted well.
[7288.42 → 7289.50] Yeah, this doesn't seem like
[7289.50 → 7290.96] a fair comparison necessarily.
[7291.34 → 7291.62] Oof.
[7292.10 → 7292.50] Oof.
[7292.80 → 7294.74] 11 and a half million box office
[7294.74 → 7295.96] on a budget of 30 million.
[7296.78 → 7297.68] Oh, that's not that high
[7297.68 → 7298.34] of a budget though.
[7298.72 → 7299.60] An animated movie?
[7299.60 → 7302.28] That's a high budget
[7302.28 → 7304.74] for a not Pixar animated movie.
[7305.16 → 7305.72] Oh, okay.
[7306.04 → 7307.94] I don't know who the heck this is.
[7308.40 → 7310.02] Oh, Peter Jackson's involved though.
[7310.30 → 7310.74] Interesting.
[7313.60 → 7314.92] Animated movies don't do well.
[7315.00 → 7315.88] You can't really say that
[7315.88 → 7317.62] because Inside Out 2
[7317.62 → 7319.30] was low-key huge.
[7319.64 → 7320.74] Inside Out 2 was good.
[7320.98 → 7321.14] Yeah.
[7321.24 → 7322.18] Also, Mario movie.
[7323.50 → 7326.56] There are big animated movies.
[7326.82 → 7327.80] The big ones do really well.
[7327.80 → 7329.56] All right.
[7329.76 → 7331.24] Yeah, I honestly had no idea
[7331.24 → 7331.80] there was this.
[7333.50 → 7335.30] Final Fantasy VII Rebirth directors
[7335.30 → 7337.04] have asked fans not to make
[7337.04 → 7338.28] inappropriate mods.
[7338.44 → 7338.74] Again.
[7339.68 → 7340.80] They told the Epic Games Store,
[7341.12 → 7342.16] while the team has no plans
[7342.16 → 7343.54] for official in-game mod support,
[7343.62 → 7344.70] we respect the creativity
[7344.70 → 7345.46] of the modding community
[7345.46 → 7346.40] and welcome their creators,
[7346.50 → 7347.22] though we ask dodders
[7347.22 → 7348.12] not to create or install
[7348.12 → 7349.48] anything offensive or inappropriate.
[7350.48 → 7351.48] Community-developed mods
[7351.48 → 7352.12] can provide everything
[7352.12 → 7352.78] from bug fixes
[7352.78 → 7353.78] and quality of life features
[7353.78 → 7355.04] to entire expansion for games,
[7355.14 → 7355.98] but can also add
[7355.98 → 7357.10] less wholesome content.
[7357.10 → 7360.88] Some PCMR members question
[7360.88 → 7362.32] if this is a genuine request
[7362.32 → 7363.60] or a clever way
[7363.60 → 7364.48] to market the game
[7364.48 → 7366.18] based on potential mod content.
[7366.44 → 7367.44] That's 100% what it is.
[7367.48 → 7368.20] Luke seems to be
[7368.20 → 7371.10] on that side,
[7371.22 → 7372.44] but I'll say this.
[7372.56 → 7373.16] I bet the bank on it.
[7373.38 → 7374.22] I'll say this.
[7375.98 → 7381.08] If this was Ubisoft,
[7381.38 → 7382.46] I would agree with you,
[7382.46 → 7385.16] but it's not.
[7386.52 → 7387.78] They've done this before.
[7389.64 → 7391.92] This exact person, I think,
[7392.18 → 7393.14] has done this before.
[7393.48 → 7393.84] Okay.
[7394.54 → 7396.98] And the results
[7396.98 → 7398.96] were exactly what you would expect.
[7399.12 → 7399.50] Sure.
[7399.68 → 7400.72] And they're doing it again,
[7401.08 → 7402.96] probably because last time
[7402.96 → 7405.46] it got a ton of press
[7405.46 → 7407.20] and a ton of people
[7407.20 → 7407.96] talked about how the game
[7407.96 → 7408.62] was movable.
[7408.84 → 7409.20] I'm like,
[7409.26 → 7409.60] oh my God,
[7409.64 → 7410.20] of course there's going to be
[7410.20 → 7410.76] inappropriate mods.
[7410.76 → 7411.54] Teepee, hooray.
[7412.10 → 7413.46] And I'm sure they know
[7413.46 → 7414.50] the same thing's going to happen again.
[7415.14 → 7415.88] What if,
[7416.42 → 7418.34] what if there are potentially
[7418.34 → 7419.98] cultural differences
[7419.98 → 7423.88] and this may genuinely be a case
[7423.88 → 7424.78] where they are just
[7424.78 → 7426.44] respectfully asking again,
[7426.92 → 7428.78] knowing that nobody listened last time
[7428.78 → 7430.74] and hoping that someone
[7430.74 → 7431.68] will actually listen.
[7432.06 → 7433.80] Do you think that is possible?
[7433.92 → 7435.04] I think it's possible, yeah.
[7435.20 → 7437.32] I do agree that that's possible.
[7437.46 → 7438.88] I think at the same time
[7438.88 → 7440.66] that if that is the case,
[7440.76 → 7442.26] I hope that they realize
[7442.26 → 7443.38] that it is doing
[7443.38 → 7445.44] completely the opposite thing.
[7445.64 → 7446.18] Maybe they do,
[7446.26 → 7447.22] maybe they don't.
[7447.28 → 7448.18] But either way,
[7448.24 → 7448.78] there are currently
[7448.78 → 7450.60] over 1,400 mods
[7450.60 → 7451.86] to FF7 remake
[7451.86 → 7452.74] on Nexus Mobs
[7452.74 → 7454.00] and at least
[7454.00 → 7455.52] a couple of hundred of them
[7455.52 → 7457.42] are not safe for when.
[7458.48 → 7458.92] Yeah.
[7460.54 → 7461.30] Tynan asks,
[7461.42 → 7462.08] could it be both?
[7462.26 → 7462.94] Yeah, it could be.
[7462.96 → 7463.54] It could be both.
[7463.60 → 7464.56] It could be a little bit of both.
[7464.64 → 7466.14] This particular individual
[7466.14 → 7467.32] or there could be members
[7467.32 → 7467.94] of the team
[7467.94 → 7469.86] that really
[7469.86 → 7471.64] are actually offended
[7471.64 → 7473.56] by like...
[7473.56 → 7474.18] I'm sure at least
[7474.18 → 7474.86] someone there
[7474.86 → 7475.68] doesn't like that
[7475.68 → 7476.36] those are happening.
[7476.56 → 7476.74] Yep.
[7476.84 → 7478.12] By the desecration
[7478.12 → 7479.40] of their beloved characters
[7479.40 → 7479.96] and art
[7479.96 → 7480.46] and you know,
[7480.50 → 7481.12] whatever else.
[7481.26 → 7481.82] And I'm sure that
[7481.82 → 7483.02] at least someone else there
[7483.02 → 7484.56] is seeing dollar signs
[7484.56 → 7485.82] and is like,
[7485.92 → 7487.04] wow, this works really well
[7487.04 → 7487.46] last time.
[7487.52 → 7488.22] I bet you we could do
[7488.22 → 7489.96] the exact same thing
[7489.96 → 7490.66] and the news media
[7490.66 → 7492.64] will do the exact same thing
[7492.64 → 7493.56] and it will be great.
[7493.56 → 7495.30] And then that's exactly
[7495.30 → 7495.72] what happened.
[7497.94 → 7498.22] Revivers,
[7498.82 → 7500.78] digital license plates
[7500.78 → 7502.84] hacked to dodge tolls
[7502.84 → 7503.32] and tickets.
[7504.12 → 7506.42] I had no idea
[7506.42 → 7507.52] that these were a thing
[7507.52 → 7508.76] until I saw this
[7508.76 → 7509.38] in the WAN docs.
[7509.46 → 7510.00] Stop it, stop it.
[7510.30 → 7511.48] Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[7511.72 → 7511.96] Okay.
[7512.82 → 7513.22] So,
[7514.08 → 7516.22] digital license plates
[7516.22 → 7517.38] with screens...
[7519.38 → 7520.44] How is that legal?
[7520.52 → 7521.38] Who could have possibly
[7521.94 → 7522.38] foreseen
[7522.38 → 7522.92] foreseen
[7522.92 → 7524.12] that somebody
[7524.12 → 7525.10] would hack them
[7525.10 → 7526.26] and change
[7526.26 → 7527.50] what's on the screen?
[7527.64 → 7527.96] Nobody.
[7528.36 → 7528.98] Who could have
[7528.98 → 7530.52] foreseen it?
[7531.52 → 7531.74] So,
[7532.32 → 7535.82] the topic here
[7535.82 → 7536.88] is all about
[7536.88 → 7537.58] what's happening
[7537.58 → 7538.88] with Revivers'
[7539.44 → 7540.72] digital license plates.
[7541.06 → 7541.92] That is like
[7541.92 → 7543.28] completely besides
[7543.28 → 7544.50] the point from...
[7544.50 → 7545.44] How do these exist?
[7545.44 → 7546.02] How the fuck
[7546.02 → 7546.84] do these exist?
[7546.94 → 7548.14] How are they legal at all?
[7548.18 → 7549.34] This is so...
[7549.34 → 7550.16] Oh my goodness.
[7550.28 → 7550.46] Dude,
[7550.46 → 7551.46] you're not even allowed
[7551.46 → 7552.46] to put like a piece
[7552.46 → 7553.58] of plastic film
[7553.58 → 7554.84] over top of your
[7554.84 → 7555.70] license plate here
[7555.70 → 7556.42] because it makes it
[7556.42 → 7557.02] more difficult
[7557.02 → 7558.12] for the traffic cameras
[7558.12 → 7559.06] to photograph them.
[7559.16 → 7559.22] Yeah.
[7559.60 → 7560.68] People do it anyway,
[7560.80 → 7561.50] but technically
[7561.50 → 7563.02] you're like not supposed to.
[7563.20 → 7563.42] Huh.
[7564.16 → 7565.54] Who the fuck
[7565.54 → 7566.42] thought this was a...
[7566.42 → 7566.82] Why?
[7567.44 → 7569.06] What is even the point of it?
[7569.44 → 7570.54] It doesn't even look
[7570.54 → 7571.28] that much different
[7571.28 → 7572.52] and it like
[7572.52 → 7573.30] would take
[7573.30 → 7574.36] some amount of energy.
[7574.70 → 7576.00] It seems very weird to me.
[7576.00 → 7577.20] Like they're super cool.
[7577.46 → 7578.58] Like you can change
[7578.58 → 7579.48] the like outer
[7579.48 → 7580.42] you know
[7580.42 → 7581.42] a border of it
[7581.42 → 7583.16] for like a vanity thing
[7583.16 → 7583.50] or whatever.
[7583.66 → 7584.38] Like yeah,
[7584.54 → 7585.34] they're super cool.
[7585.64 → 7586.60] You can do that anyway.
[7586.82 → 7587.60] I can understand
[7587.60 → 7588.46] why somebody
[7588.46 → 7589.54] would want one.
[7589.70 → 7589.88] Oh,
[7590.28 → 7591.00] that unquestionably.
[7591.74 → 7592.48] No doubt.
[7592.74 → 7594.08] All the license plate
[7594.08 → 7595.28] flipping motorcycle people?
[7595.40 → 7595.92] Yeah, definitely.
[7596.38 → 7598.04] But how anyone
[7598.04 → 7599.68] in any kind of position
[7599.68 → 7600.34] of authority
[7600.34 → 7601.62] could look at this
[7601.62 → 7602.28] and go...
[7602.28 → 7602.84] That's fine.
[7602.84 → 7603.78] Hmm, gee,
[7603.92 → 7604.86] I don't think anything
[7604.86 → 7606.30] could go wrong with this.
[7607.34 → 7607.86] What?
[7608.64 → 7609.16] Yeah.
[7610.12 → 7612.66] I was stunned.
[7612.82 → 7613.78] Here's what's going on.
[7614.96 → 7615.52] Somehow,
[7615.84 → 7616.68] I don't know
[7616.68 → 7617.26] how this happened.
[7617.84 → 7619.18] Attackers can replace
[7619.18 → 7619.84] the firmware
[7619.84 → 7621.32] on Reviver brand
[7621.32 → 7622.28] digital license plates
[7622.28 → 7622.96] which are currently
[7622.96 → 7625.06] installed on 65,000 vehicles.
[7625.46 → 7625.82] Attackers.
[7627.06 → 7628.22] The new firmware
[7628.22 → 7629.48] allows an attacker
[7629.48 → 7631.14] to change the number
[7631.14 → 7631.78] on the plate
[7631.78 → 7632.34] at will
[7632.34 → 7633.50] via a phone app
[7633.50 → 7634.72] potentially sticking
[7634.72 → 7635.66] other drivers
[7635.66 → 7636.40] with their tickets
[7636.40 → 7637.16] and tolls.
[7637.84 → 7638.78] The hack may also
[7638.78 → 7639.50] enable users
[7639.50 → 7640.10] to access
[7640.10 → 7641.24] other plate features
[7641.24 → 7642.22] without paying
[7642.22 → 7643.14] Reviver's monthly
[7643.14 → 7643.84] subscription fees
[7643.84 → 7644.58] which are apparently
[7644.58 → 7651.74] $35 a year?
[7652.54 → 7653.84] Yeah, $35 a year.
[7653.98 → 7654.46] Why?
[7655.86 → 7657.40] Why would I want
[7657.40 → 7658.82] to pay $35 a year
[7658.82 → 7660.88] to somebody else
[7660.88 → 7661.42] for my license?
[7661.42 → 7662.88] So Reviver says
[7662.88 → 7663.36] the hack
[7663.36 → 7664.20] voids the warranty
[7664.20 → 7665.16] and requires
[7665.16 → 7666.70] fancy tools
[7666.70 → 7668.70] and rare expertise.
[7669.20 → 7669.88] But researcher
[7669.88 → 7671.14] Joseph Rodriguez
[7671.14 → 7672.02] counters that
[7672.02 → 7673.06] now that the hack
[7673.06 → 7673.74] has been discovered
[7673.74 → 7674.54] a bad actor
[7674.54 → 7675.46] only needs to plug in
[7675.46 → 7675.82] a cable
[7675.82 → 7676.72] and upload a new
[7676.72 → 7677.08] firmware.
[7677.24 → 7678.10] Yeah, sounds about right.
[7678.66 → 7679.32] Reviver plates
[7679.32 → 7680.14] will send a notification
[7680.14 → 7681.04] to the owner
[7681.04 → 7681.80] if they are detached
[7681.80 → 7682.46] from a vehicle
[7682.46 → 7683.62] so attackers may need
[7683.62 → 7684.68] to jam or overcome
[7684.68 → 7686.22] that feature in some way.
[7686.72 → 7687.46] There's apparently
[7687.46 → 7688.70] no way for Reviver
[7688.70 → 7689.84] to update the software
[7689.84 → 7690.78] to prevent the jailbreak.
[7690.84 → 7691.30] It is apparently
[7691.30 → 7692.02] in hardware
[7692.02 → 7692.96] and this is not
[7692.96 → 7693.66] the first time
[7693.66 → 7694.10] their system
[7694.10 → 7694.80] has been compromised.
[7695.06 → 7695.66] In 2022,
[7696.30 → 7696.70] vulnerabilities
[7696.70 → 7697.60] in Reviver's
[7697.60 → 7698.34] web infrastructure
[7698.34 → 7699.30] allowed attackers
[7699.30 → 7700.20] to gain administrative
[7700.20 → 7700.64] privileges
[7700.64 → 7701.30] on their back-end
[7701.30 → 7701.90] database allowing
[7701.90 → 7702.26] the ability
[7702.26 → 7702.84] to track and
[7702.84 → 7703.34] change plates
[7703.34 → 7703.74] at will.
[7704.54 → 7705.02] Digital plates
[7705.02 → 7705.62] are currently
[7705.62 → 7706.62] legal to buy
[7706.62 → 7707.26] and register
[7707.26 → 7708.04] in California,
[7708.28 → 7708.60] Arizona,
[7708.78 → 7709.42] and Michigan.
[7710.30 → 7710.42] Wow.
[7710.98 → 7711.70] Our discussion
[7711.70 → 7712.78] question is...
[7712.78 → 7713.20] I didn't know
[7713.20 → 7713.82] automated speeding
[7713.82 → 7714.62] tickets didn't exist
[7714.62 → 7715.02] there anymore.
[7715.30 → 7716.18] What problems
[7716.18 → 7717.48] are being solved
[7717.48 → 7718.50] with a digital
[7718.50 → 7719.38] license plate?
[7719.68 → 7720.04] Nothing.
[7720.50 → 7721.38] I don't understand
[7721.38 → 7722.40] its point at all.
[7723.36 → 7724.50] Okay, other than
[7724.50 → 7725.50] getting away with
[7725.50 → 7726.18] speeding tickets
[7726.18 → 7726.80] and tolls.
[7726.92 → 7728.04] That I completely
[7728.04 → 7728.64] understand.
[7729.00 → 7729.84] Vanity themes.
[7730.50 → 7731.04] But like,
[7731.10 → 7732.54] is that even...
[7732.54 → 7733.90] What are you really
[7733.90 → 7734.62] allowed to do?
[7734.74 → 7735.04] Because like,
[7735.10 → 7735.58] in the picture
[7735.58 → 7736.10] that we have,
[7736.14 → 7736.76] it's just a super
[7736.76 → 7737.60] normal license plate.
[7737.74 → 7738.80] No, you can put
[7738.80 → 7739.80] like, cute things
[7739.80 → 7740.08] on it.
[7740.68 → 7741.40] Anyway, there's a...
[7741.40 → 7742.24] Is that any different
[7742.24 → 7742.64] than just like,
[7742.72 → 7743.40] putting a sticker
[7743.40 → 7744.52] on your normal
[7744.52 → 7745.08] license plate?
[7745.52 → 7746.72] Dude, I don't know.
[7748.24 → 7748.98] Custom banner
[7748.98 → 7749.38] messages.
[7749.54 → 7750.12] Oh my god.
[7750.66 → 7752.24] At $75 a year,
[7752.34 → 7753.44] they limit how many
[7753.44 → 7754.10] custom banner
[7754.10 → 7754.88] messages you can
[7754.88 → 7755.50] put on it.
[7755.70 → 7756.74] Why are you allowed
[7756.74 → 7757.44] to put custom
[7757.44 → 7758.78] banner messages?
[7760.06 → 7760.58] Like, that's...
[7760.58 → 7761.30] Is that not like
[7761.30 → 7762.80] distracted driving?
[7763.02 → 7763.58] Dude...
[7763.58 → 7764.38] How is that okay?
[7764.56 → 7765.04] Well, no, you would
[7765.04 → 7765.46] do that while you're
[7765.46 → 7766.02] not driving.
[7767.78 → 7768.76] It can pay your
[7768.76 → 7769.96] tolls, display
[7769.96 → 7770.72] amber alerts,
[7770.90 → 7771.52] and track your
[7771.52 → 7771.98] location.
[7772.44 → 7773.06] I think you can
[7773.06 → 7774.46] also use it for...
[7774.46 → 7775.74] You can use it
[7775.74 → 7776.16] for like,
[7776.22 → 7776.64] anti-theft.
[7776.64 → 7777.14] I don't think
[7777.14 → 7777.60] it can track
[7777.60 → 7778.10] your location.
[7778.28 → 7779.10] They have a statement
[7779.10 → 7780.78] specifically saying...
[7780.78 → 7782.18] Reviver reached out
[7782.18 → 7783.40] with us with a
[7783.40 → 7784.20] statement saying that
[7784.20 → 7785.44] the license plates
[7785.44 → 7786.06] do not have
[7786.06 → 7786.92] GPS capabilities.
[7787.84 → 7788.46] Okay, maybe this
[7788.46 → 7789.24] is a different...
[7789.24 → 7790.30] Maybe this is a
[7790.30 → 7791.08] different startup then.
[7791.82 → 7792.52] So, I don't know
[7792.52 → 7793.08] what this is.
[7793.58 → 7794.44] Anyway, okay.
[7794.70 → 7795.50] Yeah, I don't know...
[7795.50 → 7796.04] Oh, yeah,
[7796.12 → 7796.80] Reviver's plates
[7796.80 → 7797.42] though don't come
[7797.42 → 7797.66] cheap.
[7797.66 → 7799.68] Oh, yeah.
[7799.76 → 7800.28] Did I mention the
[7800.28 → 7800.46] plates?
[7800.54 → 7800.84] $500?
[7800.84 → 7803.96] If you want to
[7803.96 → 7804.62] give it a cool
[7804.62 → 7805.64] border, buy a
[7805.64 → 7806.42] plastic one that
[7806.42 → 7807.20] have existed for
[7807.20 → 7808.18] a trillion years.
[7808.36 → 7809.02] And if you want
[7809.02 → 7810.70] the little cool
[7810.70 → 7811.38] banner things,
[7811.44 → 7812.08] just put stickers
[7812.08 → 7812.46] on it.
[7812.54 → 7813.00] Sure thing,
[7813.10 → 7813.48] grandpa.
[7814.26 → 7814.70] Sheesh.
[7815.58 → 7816.02] Sheesh.
[7816.36 → 7817.06] I'm okay with
[7817.06 → 7817.88] being old if that's
[7817.88 → 7818.32] the line.
[7818.48 → 7819.48] Reboot Rewind has
[7819.48 → 7819.92] started their
[7819.92 → 7820.90] crowdfunding campaign.
[7820.90 → 7821.62] It's over on
[7821.62 → 7822.22] GoFundMe.
[7822.38 → 7823.10] Just wanted to
[7823.10 → 7823.82] promote this real
[7823.82 → 7824.48] quick because it's
[7824.48 → 7825.22] a super cool
[7825.22 → 7826.46] mission.
[7826.46 → 7828.10] the show
[7828.10 → 7830.52] reboot was
[7830.52 → 7831.52] kind of part of
[7831.52 → 7832.36] our childhood,
[7832.56 → 7833.26] especially here in
[7833.26 → 7833.56] Canada.
[7833.74 → 7833.98] Yeah.
[7834.10 → 7834.86] And the original
[7834.86 → 7835.38] tapes have been
[7835.38 → 7836.16] found, but it's a
[7836.16 → 7837.56] lot of work to
[7837.56 → 7839.04] get them fixed.
[7839.18 → 7840.48] So I think we
[7840.48 → 7841.52] could probably
[7841.52 → 7842.12] throw a thousand
[7842.12 → 7842.70] bucks at it.
[7842.74 → 7843.38] If you guys want
[7843.38 → 7843.86] to throw a little
[7843.86 → 7844.44] bit of money at
[7844.44 → 7846.04] it, that'd be
[7846.04 → 7846.96] super cool.
[7847.22 → 7848.00] I'm just going to
[7848.00 → 7848.58] forward this to
[7848.58 → 7848.98] accounting.
[7849.22 → 7849.70] If there's anything
[7849.70 → 7850.16] else for you to
[7850.16 → 7850.66] say about that
[7850.66 → 7851.44] topic, go ahead,
[7851.52 → 7852.10] but I need to do
[7852.10 → 7852.34] this.
[7852.54 → 7853.22] So, yeah.
[7853.22 → 7856.58] YouTube
[7856.58 → 7857.44] announces slash
[7857.44 → 7858.40] changes this week.
[7858.74 → 7859.56] Clickbait slash
[7859.56 → 7860.66] voice reply slash
[7860.66 → 7861.68] third-party AI
[7861.68 → 7862.22] training.
[7862.38 → 7863.22] YouTube announced
[7863.22 → 7864.70] starting in India
[7864.70 → 7865.60] it will be removing
[7865.60 → 7867.30] egregious clickbait
[7867.30 → 7869.04] defined as videos
[7869.04 → 7869.90] where the title slash
[7869.90 → 7870.56] thumbnail don't
[7870.56 → 7871.26] match the content.
[7871.44 → 7871.86] Wow.
[7872.02 → 7872.40] Interesting.
[7872.78 → 7873.82] Some examples they
[7873.82 → 7875.48] use are in quotes
[7875.48 → 7876.60] the president of the
[7876.60 → 7877.82] USA steps down
[7877.82 → 7878.90] where obviously that
[7878.90 → 7879.62] didn't happen.
[7880.08 → 7881.22] What if it's a skit
[7881.22 → 7881.48] though?
[7882.88 → 7883.20] Yeah.
[7883.22 → 7886.46] I have heard and I
[7886.46 → 7887.60] haven't experienced
[7887.60 → 7888.44] it personally, but I
[7888.44 → 7889.58] have heard that
[7889.58 → 7891.84] misinformation is a
[7891.84 → 7893.54] particular problem,
[7893.86 → 7895.66] like especially in
[7895.66 → 7896.98] India, in like
[7896.98 → 7897.88] WhatsApp groups.
[7898.30 → 7900.82] And apparently, I
[7900.82 → 7901.40] don't know this, I
[7901.40 → 7902.14] have not experienced
[7902.14 → 7904.12] this, but apparently
[7904.12 → 7907.52] it is, it is, it
[7907.52 → 7908.94] just spreads like
[7908.94 → 7910.66] absolute wildfire and
[7910.66 → 7911.60] it's caused some
[7911.60 → 7912.86] serious problems.
[7913.76 → 7914.68] That's all I really
[7914.68 → 7916.02] have to say about
[7916.02 → 7916.48] that.
[7916.56 → 7917.26] That's, that's all I've
[7917.26 → 7917.48] heard.
[7918.08 → 7918.32] Interesting.
[7918.70 → 7919.94] YouTube also allows
[7919.94 → 7921.32] creators to opt in to
[7921.32 → 7922.52] third-party AI
[7922.52 → 7923.76] training.
[7924.14 → 7924.52] What are they
[7924.52 → 7924.78] training?
[7925.04 → 7925.38] Question mark.
[7925.50 → 7926.40] Who knows?
[7927.24 → 7927.64] But at least
[7927.64 → 7928.30] creators have the
[7928.30 → 7929.14] option to opt in.
[7929.20 → 7929.66] It's not on by
[7929.66 → 7930.00] default.
[7930.28 → 7930.48] What?
[7930.48 → 7931.16] This is just YouTube
[7931.16 → 7931.92] announcements this
[7931.92 → 7932.18] week.
[7932.38 → 7933.28] So this is completely
[7933.28 → 7933.96] separate from the
[7933.96 → 7934.24] other thing.
[7934.30 → 7934.96] So no, yeah, for
[7934.96 → 7935.14] sure.
[7935.22 → 7936.18] That's just so weird.
[7936.62 → 7937.76] YouTube is also
[7937.76 → 7938.90] testing a new voice
[7938.90 → 7940.30] reply feature in
[7940.30 → 7940.74] comments.
[7940.74 → 7941.90] this can only be
[7941.90 → 7943.28] done by the creator
[7943.28 → 7943.92] of the video.
[7944.26 → 7945.28] That's actually really
[7945.28 → 7945.54] cool.
[7945.70 → 7946.98] It has to be a reply to
[7946.98 → 7947.86] someone else's comment
[7947.86 → 7949.66] and only on iOS.
[7950.06 → 7950.62] What?
[7951.56 → 7952.68] For select channels?
[7953.04 → 7954.42] Why only on iOS?
[7954.78 → 7955.46] I don't know, man.
[7955.50 → 7956.48] This is kind of based on
[7956.48 → 7957.48] something that I had
[7957.48 → 7958.42] asked them to do a
[7958.42 → 7958.86] while back.
[7958.90 → 7959.80] I definitely didn't ask
[7959.80 → 7960.56] it for to be only on
[7960.56 → 7960.82] iOS.
[7961.28 → 7962.02] But you got to
[7962.02 → 7963.28] understand iOS is
[7963.28 → 7964.60] probably, if I had to
[7964.60 → 7965.34] guess, I'd say it's
[7965.34 → 7967.24] like 90% of top YouTube
[7967.24 → 7967.52] creators.
[7967.52 → 7968.20] It's not their own
[7968.20 → 7968.70] thing.
[7968.88 → 7969.24] I know.
[7969.94 → 7970.54] It doesn't matter.
[7972.16 → 7972.92] At the end of the
[7972.92 → 7974.40] day, look, look, I
[7974.40 → 7974.94] could make this
[7974.94 → 7975.50] argument the other
[7975.50 → 7976.10] way, too.
[7976.98 → 7977.74] Should they serve
[7977.74 → 7978.50] their customers or
[7978.50 → 7979.10] should they serve
[7979.10 → 7980.20] their own platform?
[7980.38 → 7980.84] Do both.
[7981.20 → 7981.90] Well, sure.
[7982.10 → 7982.62] It's released on
[7982.62 → 7983.30] Android and iOS.
[7986.10 → 7986.74] That's not the
[7986.74 → 7987.18] question I was
[7987.18 → 7987.42] asking.
[7987.68 → 7988.38] Yeah, and when
[7988.38 → 7989.44] you're trialling a new
[7989.44 → 7990.20] feature that might
[7990.20 → 7991.28] not ever even go
[7991.28 → 7992.32] full release, like,
[7993.16 → 7994.54] do you do the 50%
[7994.54 → 7995.24] of the work that
[7995.24 → 7996.48] reaches 90% of your
[7996.48 → 7997.52] users or do you do
[7997.52 → 7998.56] the 100% of the
[7998.56 → 7999.16] work that reaches
[7999.16 → 7999.92] 100% of your
[7999.92 → 8000.24] users?
[8000.66 → 8001.86] I understand it.
[8001.94 → 8002.68] I don't have to
[8002.68 → 8004.08] like it, but I do
[8004.08 → 8004.76] understand it.
[8008.42 → 8008.82] Yeah.
[8009.82 → 8010.22] Discussion
[8010.22 → 8010.62] question.
[8011.10 → 8012.38] Now, team green
[8012.38 → 8013.12] act in SUS.
[8013.64 → 8014.58] A user posted this
[8014.58 → 8015.26] week on X that they
[8015.26 → 8016.08] were experiencing up
[8016.08 → 8017.68] to a 15% penalty in
[8017.68 → 8018.32] performance while
[8018.32 → 8019.14] having the NVIDIA
[8019.14 → 8019.90] app installed on
[8019.90 → 8020.42] their computer.
[8021.16 → 8021.92] Several other users
[8021.92 → 8022.96] and publications also
[8022.96 → 8023.84] tested this claim with
[8023.84 → 8024.76] a variety of games
[8024.76 → 8027.56] and while some may
[8027.56 → 8028.60] reach up to a 15%
[8028.60 → 8029.44] penalty, it seems that
[8029.44 → 8030.16] across the board,
[8030.32 → 8031.00] every game that was
[8031.00 → 8031.80] tested stopped between
[8031.80 → 8033.08] 2% and 12% on
[8033.08 → 8033.40] average.
[8033.52 → 8033.96] I think there was
[8033.96 → 8034.82] some solution here.
[8034.88 → 8035.26] I think you're just
[8035.26 → 8035.88] had to, like, turn a
[8035.88 → 8036.68] particular setting off.
[8036.72 → 8037.50] Yes, and NVIDIA is
[8037.50 → 8038.64] working on fixing it.
[8038.78 → 8039.64] So we just wanted to
[8039.64 → 8040.50] make sure people know
[8040.50 → 8041.84] to go ahead and...
[8041.84 → 8042.28] Do we know what the
[8042.28 → 8042.78] setting is, though?
[8042.78 → 8043.28] I don't remember.
[8043.48 → 8044.00] Go Google it.
[8044.20 → 8045.70] Yeah, it's definitely
[8045.70 → 8046.22] Google-able.
[8046.38 → 8047.30] It's a very easy and
[8047.30 → 8047.86] quick fix.
[8048.80 → 8050.16] Like, it sucks, but it's
[8050.16 → 8051.24] not difficult to solve.
[8052.24 → 8052.96] Citizen5391 asks,
[8052.96 → 8054.12] how much flexibility do
[8054.12 → 8055.00] you have with accounting?
[8055.34 → 8056.88] You gave away $500 and
[8056.88 → 8058.08] now a $1,000 donation.
[8059.10 → 8061.70] I mean, how do I put
[8061.70 → 8062.04] this?
[8062.52 → 8064.00] It's all his dollars.
[8064.34 → 8065.04] Well, it's not.
[8065.26 → 8065.42] Sort of.
[8065.54 → 8066.24] It's all yours and
[8066.24 → 8066.86] Yvonne's dollars.
[8067.14 → 8069.66] It's mine if I decide to
[8069.66 → 8070.44] give it to me.
[8070.64 → 8071.60] Which means it's yours.
[8072.14 → 8073.58] But it isn't yet.
[8073.78 → 8074.08] Right.
[8074.20 → 8075.18] Until such time...
[8075.18 → 8075.62] But you have full
[8075.62 → 8076.18] control of it.
[8076.20 → 8077.24] ...as I decide to give
[8077.24 → 8078.08] it to myself.
[8078.20 → 8078.82] It means it's yours.
[8079.26 → 8080.24] But it isn't yet.
[8080.30 → 8081.30] But you own it, which
[8081.30 → 8081.64] means it's yours.
[8081.64 → 8082.22] I don't, though.
[8082.42 → 8083.10] You do, though, because
[8083.10 → 8083.76] you own the company which
[8083.76 → 8083.90] holds it.
[8083.90 → 8085.20] I own the company that is
[8085.20 → 8086.66] a separate and distinct
[8086.66 → 8087.36] legal entity.
[8087.44 → 8088.16] But you own that.
[8088.28 → 8088.86] That owns it.
[8088.90 → 8089.78] And it owns that.
[8089.84 → 8090.22] I do.
[8090.76 → 8093.70] But that entity, with its
[8093.70 → 8094.64] board of directors...
[8094.64 → 8095.66] Through inheritance, you
[8095.66 → 8096.58] own the money.
[8097.36 → 8098.28] You own the company that
[8098.28 → 8098.78] owns the money.
[8098.86 → 8099.60] You're being very literal
[8099.60 → 8100.20] right now, Luke.
[8100.20 → 8101.14] You're being very literal.
[8101.24 → 8102.52] Luke, I could stab you.
[8102.64 → 8103.46] I just haven't yet.
[8103.94 → 8104.34] Yeah.
[8105.02 → 8105.42] Yeah.
[8105.64 → 8106.30] Same thing.
[8106.70 → 8107.80] I have a knife.
[8108.06 → 8109.12] No, it's not the same
[8109.12 → 8109.58] thing at all.
[8110.08 → 8110.52] No, it's not.
[8110.52 → 8111.38] It is the same thing.
[8111.42 → 8111.62] Yeah.
[8111.70 → 8112.86] It is the same thing.
[8112.94 → 8114.08] The government has to get
[8114.08 → 8115.46] involved after I do it.
[8119.94 → 8121.18] It's not the same thing.
[8122.32 → 8122.68] Elijah.
[8123.48 → 8123.88] Enough.
[8123.88 → 8128.48] Anyway, the point is that
[8128.48 → 8130.30] at the end of the day, if
[8130.30 → 8132.64] it's just down to money, as
[8132.64 → 8133.52] long as I'm not doing
[8133.52 → 8134.44] something that's going to
[8134.44 → 8136.44] get Yvonne mad at me, or
[8136.44 → 8137.64] that is going to affect
[8137.64 → 8139.36] someone on the team's goals
[8139.36 → 8142.02] or their KPIs or their
[8142.02 → 8143.12] quarterly bonus or whatever
[8143.12 → 8145.24] else, if it's just out of
[8145.24 → 8146.32] the profits of the company,
[8146.76 → 8150.06] then I have basically, to
[8150.06 → 8152.18] Luke's point, full discretion
[8152.18 → 8153.62] to do whatever the fuck I
[8153.62 → 8153.94] want with it.
[8153.94 → 8154.84] No, you could technically
[8154.84 → 8155.68] do all those things
[8155.68 → 8156.10] anyway.
[8156.60 → 8157.54] That's self-control.
[8157.76 → 8158.58] Oh, well, no, no, no.
[8158.60 → 8160.38] I just mean in terms of
[8160.38 → 8162.18] what my rules are.
[8162.68 → 8163.70] Yeah, that's what I mean,
[8163.72 → 8163.80] though.
[8163.82 → 8164.70] It's self-control because
[8164.70 → 8165.60] you own it.
[8165.74 → 8168.76] So I know that Yvonne's
[8168.76 → 8170.18] not going to be upset about
[8170.18 → 8172.94] us donating that amount of
[8172.94 → 8174.90] money to a cause that we
[8174.90 → 8176.00] think is cool.
[8176.12 → 8176.58] And I don't think
[8176.58 → 8177.54] accounting is going to be
[8177.54 → 8178.12] bothered.
[8178.12 → 8180.24] It's another check.
[8180.46 → 8180.56] Yeah.
[8180.62 → 8181.96] Like it's, it's, yeah.
[8182.10 → 8183.36] So, so whereas if I was
[8183.36 → 8185.30] doing something like in
[8185.30 → 8187.26] the middle of WAN show, I
[8187.26 → 8188.40] took a brand-new product
[8188.40 → 8189.34] that we launched and I
[8189.34 → 8192.18] marked it down 90%, right?
[8192.44 → 8193.98] The creator warehouse team
[8193.98 → 8197.18] now has to scramble to get
[8197.18 → 8198.08] a new order in.
[8198.20 → 8199.50] They now have to figure out
[8199.50 → 8200.26] what the heck they're going
[8200.26 → 8201.50] to do about all the sales
[8201.50 → 8202.70] that were cannibalized by
[8202.70 → 8203.92] this new product that is now
[8203.92 → 8204.96] priced way under it.
[8204.96 → 8206.66] They have goals around
[8206.66 → 8208.02] profitability for the store
[8208.02 → 8209.12] and inventory management
[8209.12 → 8210.02] that I've now just
[8210.02 → 8210.96] completely screwed up.
[8211.32 → 8212.20] Self-sabotaging your own
[8212.20 → 8212.56] company.
[8212.70 → 8214.06] That's a and, and, and,
[8214.14 → 8215.04] and the people within it,
[8215.04 → 8216.56] and the people within it.
[8216.62 → 8217.34] If we're creating a bunch
[8217.34 → 8218.30] of work for people, that's
[8218.30 → 8218.84] not okay.
[8219.08 → 8220.96] But if we're contributing
[8220.96 → 8224.20] some cash that isn't mine
[8224.20 → 8225.34] because I haven't decided to
[8225.34 → 8228.52] give it to myself yet, then
[8228.52 → 8230.78] towards a like a project
[8230.78 → 8232.06] that's kind of cool and is
[8232.06 → 8232.92] aligned with our corporate
[8232.92 → 8234.10] values and with mine and
[8234.10 → 8235.36] Yvonne's personal values,
[8235.36 → 8237.44] then that's not a problem.
[8237.56 → 8237.72] Yeah.
[8237.84 → 8238.32] That's fine.
[8240.78 → 8242.70] Um, just wait till, just
[8242.70 → 8244.54] wait till, I'm not saying
[8244.54 → 8245.64] he's going to do this, but
[8245.64 → 8246.36] this is pretty normal.
[8246.68 → 8247.86] Just wait till he sets up a
[8247.86 → 8248.16] charity.
[8250.24 → 8251.60] Then you just, yep.
[8253.78 → 8258.10] It's, I, it's more of a
[8258.10 → 8258.80] thing in the U S.
[8258.94 → 8259.14] Yes.
[8259.42 → 8260.36] It's not as applicable.
[8260.56 → 8260.72] Yeah.
[8260.72 → 8262.30] It's, it's, it's less of a
[8262.30 → 8264.34] just like infinite money.
[8264.34 → 8266.10] Isn't it weird how when
[8266.10 → 8267.56] especially American, but
[8267.56 → 8268.54] business people in general
[8268.54 → 8269.62] get really, really rich, they
[8269.62 → 8271.38] suddenly become philanthropists.
[8272.32 → 8272.72] Wow.
[8273.84 → 8275.06] I wonder why.
[8276.34 → 8277.26] It's a whole thing.
[8277.34 → 8278.60] It's a whole rabbit hole and
[8278.60 → 8280.16] it's not all conspiracy theory
[8280.16 → 8280.46] nonsense.
[8280.46 → 8281.76] There is a lot mixed in with
[8281.76 → 8282.56] it, which is kind of annoying
[8282.56 → 8284.46] and frustrating, but, um,
[8285.04 → 8288.48] yeah, it basically, yeah.
[8288.72 → 8289.50] Like, okay.
[8289.80 → 8291.34] Mackenzie Scott seems to be
[8291.34 → 8292.18] actually doing it.
[8293.34 → 8294.16] Which one's that?
[8294.34 → 8295.24] That's the one that used to
[8295.24 → 8295.76] be Bezos.
[8296.04 → 8296.80] Oh yeah.
[8297.28 → 8298.54] But it turns out he prefers
[8298.54 → 8300.60] like nice 400 pound lips.
[8300.98 → 8303.56] So I've genuinely no idea
[8303.56 → 8304.70] what you're talking about.
[8304.72 → 8304.94] It's fine.
[8305.00 → 8305.60] Don't worry about it.
[8305.60 → 8307.10] I didn't follow that at all.
[8307.18 → 8309.70] I was like, wow, this has no
[8309.70 → 8311.62] relevance at all to my life.
[8311.62 → 8313.96] Jeff Bezos's ex-wife seems
[8313.96 → 8315.66] to be like actually giving
[8315.66 → 8317.98] away a ton of money in a way
[8317.98 → 8319.04] that's legitimately actually
[8319.04 → 8319.36] helpful.
[8319.64 → 8319.92] Nice.
[8320.40 → 8322.18] Um, okay.
[8322.18 → 8323.36] Not buying all the farmland
[8323.36 → 8323.78] in the States?
[8325.32 → 8326.06] Yeah, well.
[8326.18 → 8326.90] We can move on.
[8327.82 → 8328.82] Oh, they want me to fix my
[8328.82 → 8329.10] sleeves.
[8329.18 → 8329.78] Sorry about that.
[8330.14 → 8330.46] All right.
[8330.82 → 8331.92] Uh, Ranks After Dark?
[8332.06 → 8332.84] Merch massages.
[8333.00 → 8333.54] Let's do it.
[8333.62 → 8333.86] Sure.
[8335.98 → 8337.70] Oh, we also got to go purple.
[8338.42 → 8338.98] There we go.
[8339.20 → 8339.60] Nice.
[8339.88 → 8340.28] Nice.
[8340.28 → 8341.50] You didn't do it within
[8341.50 → 8342.34] three seconds?
[8342.48 → 8344.20] No, I was just trying to
[8344.20 → 8344.42] help.
[8344.58 → 8345.44] Yeah, why do you get to
[8345.44 → 8346.08] ride people like that?
[8346.08 → 8347.20] He's going to stab me now.
[8347.62 → 8348.40] Well, I don't blame him.
[8348.58 → 8349.02] I might.
[8350.88 → 8351.54] Hasn't yet.
[8351.96 → 8352.94] I'll do it for reboot.
[8354.98 → 8355.34] Luke!
[8356.52 → 8360.66] I just got Oblivion on
[8360.66 → 8361.40] sale from Steam.
[8361.56 → 8361.62] Nice.
[8361.62 → 8362.92] Do you have any suggestions
[8362.92 → 8364.68] for greatest enjoyment?
[8365.04 → 8366.28] Should I wait for Sky Oblivion
[8366.28 → 8367.08] before I start?
[8367.08 → 8367.20] Wait.
[8369.14 → 8369.94] You might want to wait.
[8370.12 → 8370.56] I don't know.
[8371.02 → 8372.46] Sky Oblivion's different, right?
[8372.52 → 8374.40] Like, there's new voice actors.
[8374.72 → 8375.86] There's been changes to some
[8375.86 → 8376.62] of the items.
[8376.82 → 8377.92] There's all this stuff going on.
[8378.28 → 8379.38] It's also not out yet.
[8379.52 → 8381.12] It is theoretically releasing
[8381.12 → 8382.20] in the year that's going to
[8382.20 → 8383.10] start in a couple of weeks.
[8383.28 → 8386.78] But we don't technically know
[8386.78 → 8388.20] how good it's going to be.
[8388.32 → 8389.94] And it will technically be
[8389.94 → 8390.82] a different experience.
[8390.82 → 8392.44] Now, if you just got it
[8392.44 → 8393.60] and you're going to play
[8393.60 → 8394.78] all Oblivion
[8394.78 → 8396.50] and then play all Oblivion
[8396.50 → 8397.50] again when Sky Oblivion
[8397.50 → 8397.94] comes out,
[8398.00 → 8399.30] that sounds like too much.
[8399.60 → 8400.62] That sounds like a lot
[8400.62 → 8401.20] of Oblivion.
[8401.32 → 8401.58] Yeah.
[8401.74 → 8402.76] I played Oblivion
[8402.76 → 8408.30] approaching on
[8408.30 → 8409.46] two decades ago?
[8410.92 → 8411.80] That's probably been
[8411.80 → 8412.62] enough time for me.
[8413.52 → 8414.18] But yeah,
[8414.28 → 8415.68] I might wait
[8415.68 → 8416.26] if I were you.
[8416.34 → 8416.86] But I don't know.
[8417.08 → 8417.74] Make your own decision.
[8417.92 → 8419.18] Go watch the Sky Oblivion videos
[8419.18 → 8420.28] and then figure it out.
[8420.66 → 8420.84] Yeah.
[8420.84 → 8422.66] And whatever you do,
[8423.46 → 8425.52] don't mod Sky Oblivion
[8425.52 → 8426.82] with not safe for work
[8426.82 → 8427.56] character models.
[8429.68 → 8430.12] Yeah.
[8431.66 → 8432.64] Zero hot coffee.
[8432.68 → 8433.62] There's none of those.
[8433.74 → 8434.92] Those don't exist for sure.
[8438.12 → 8439.52] Will there be a Luxe version
[8439.52 → 8440.74] of the Commuter Backpack?
[8441.82 → 8443.28] I doubt it.
[8445.24 → 8445.88] People would,
[8446.04 → 8446.66] yeah,
[8446.76 → 8447.92] people would probably like it.
[8448.38 → 8449.10] Super Limited Run?
[8449.56 → 8450.02] Yeah.
[8450.84 → 8453.50] So,
[8453.86 → 8455.36] our relationship
[8455.36 → 8456.64] with our previous
[8456.64 → 8457.72] backpack supplier
[8457.72 → 8459.84] got a little strained.
[8460.60 → 8461.64] We haven't been
[8461.64 → 8462.84] a perfect partner either.
[8463.32 → 8463.90] There have been
[8463.90 → 8464.60] some projects
[8464.60 → 8465.70] that we started
[8465.70 → 8466.26] with them
[8466.26 → 8467.78] that they did work on,
[8467.86 → 8468.04] you know,
[8468.10 → 8469.80] sampling and stuff like that,
[8469.90 → 8470.78] that ultimately
[8470.78 → 8471.84] did not make it
[8471.84 → 8472.52] to mass production
[8472.52 → 8473.00] with them.
[8473.00 → 8484.52] but we did move forward
[8484.52 → 8485.88] with and create
[8485.88 → 8486.90] as products.
[8488.28 → 8488.92] You know,
[8489.02 → 8489.52] they're not
[8489.52 → 8491.12] understandably
[8491.12 → 8492.12] thrilled
[8492.12 → 8493.20] about that.
[8494.58 → 8495.10] There,
[8495.26 → 8495.50] however,
[8495.64 → 8496.58] were some things
[8496.58 → 8497.36] on our side
[8497.36 → 8498.36] that we were not
[8498.36 → 8499.78] thrilled about either,
[8499.78 → 8500.46] like the fact
[8500.46 → 8501.56] that we bought
[8501.56 → 8502.98] 40,000 backpacks
[8502.98 → 8503.48] that were supposed
[8503.48 → 8504.36] to have a double-layered
[8504.36 → 8505.10] bottom and instead
[8505.10 → 8505.54] did not.
[8506.70 → 8507.78] We weren't thrilled
[8507.78 → 8509.10] about the design flaw
[8509.10 → 8510.62] with the carabiner things.
[8510.84 → 8511.06] Like, yeah,
[8511.14 → 8511.80] could we have caught
[8511.80 → 8512.22] them earlier?
[8512.34 → 8512.70] Yeah, sure,
[8512.74 → 8513.38] that would have been nice,
[8513.44 → 8513.98] but we, like,
[8514.02 → 8514.78] didn't design them
[8514.78 → 8515.46] or validate them.
[8515.56 → 8516.10] That was supposed
[8516.10 → 8516.78] to be, you know,
[8517.38 → 8519.02] the backpack-making experts
[8519.02 → 8520.06] that we were partnered with.
[8520.06 → 8522.74] Um, so, so, so, so,
[8522.74 → 8523.14] so, so,
[8523.14 → 8525.74] the Lux products
[8525.74 → 8527.70] were made in cooperation
[8527.70 → 8528.60] with our previous
[8528.60 → 8529.40] backpack supplier.
[8529.96 → 8530.52] So you'd have to,
[8530.64 → 8531.08] like, redo.
[8531.30 → 8532.18] It is possible
[8532.18 → 8533.20] that we could do
[8533.20 → 8534.66] another Lux something,
[8535.14 → 8536.14] um, maybe with
[8536.14 → 8536.76] an apple leather,
[8536.92 → 8537.80] maybe with, uh,
[8537.80 → 8539.00] apparently banana fibres
[8539.00 → 8540.80] are, like, super cool.
[8540.88 → 8541.70] There's some really cool
[8541.70 → 8542.46] stuff from there.
[8542.70 → 8543.38] Uh, this came up
[8543.38 → 8544.14] actually during our
[8544.14 → 8545.14] last Merge meeting
[8545.14 → 8545.74] we were having a
[8545.74 → 8546.56] conversation about this.
[8547.56 → 8548.96] Um, the problem is
[8548.96 → 8549.92] that the volumes are
[8549.92 → 8550.42] tiny
[8550.42 → 8551.02] and the opportunity
[8551.02 → 8551.88] cost of working
[8551.88 → 8552.64] on a Lux product
[8552.64 → 8553.48] is very high.
[8553.62 → 8554.34] There's a lot of other
[8554.34 → 8555.08] stuff that we could do
[8555.08 → 8556.24] instead of faffing
[8556.24 → 8557.46] about making, you know,
[8557.50 → 8558.22] a couple of hundred
[8558.22 → 8558.84] backpacks.
[8559.52 → 8561.18] So, will we ever do it?
[8561.22 → 8562.06] I'd like to.
[8562.28 → 8563.42] I'd like to have a Lux
[8563.42 → 8564.14] commuter backpack.
[8564.82 → 8566.32] Um, and the people
[8566.32 → 8567.96] who bought the original
[8567.96 → 8568.66] Lux backpack
[8568.66 → 8572.30] are extremely, um,
[8572.46 → 8573.90] are extremely happy
[8573.90 → 8574.34] with it.
[8575.08 → 8576.10] Like, look at this thing.
[8577.28 → 8578.34] 19 reviews.
[8578.34 → 8580.40] This is a $600 bag
[8580.40 → 8582.16] and, like, the nice
[8582.16 → 8583.38] looking, best functioning
[8583.38 → 8584.96] backpack I've ever
[8584.96 → 8585.40] owned.
[8586.10 → 8587.80] Um, okay, someone
[8587.80 → 8588.58] hasn't got it?
[8589.28 → 8590.28] Okay, well, we'll have
[8590.28 → 8591.04] to get that sorted out.
[8591.14 → 8592.18] I mean, customer service
[8592.18 → 8592.88] should be looking into
[8592.88 → 8594.56] any tickets or, um,
[8594.64 → 8595.74] any reviews that are,
[8595.94 → 8596.72] that are particularly
[8596.72 → 8596.94] problematic.
[8596.94 → 8597.50] Oh, they got a refund.
[8598.04 → 8599.04] Oh, they got a refund.
[8599.54 → 8599.76] Oh.
[8600.00 → 8600.90] Oh, they got a refund.
[8601.12 → 8601.92] Exchange rates.
[8602.08 → 8602.32] Oh!
[8602.74 → 8604.34] Oh, I mean, uh,
[8604.34 → 8605.82] the accounting of that
[8605.82 → 8606.84] is very complicated
[8606.84 → 8607.42] and I'm not going to
[8607.42 → 8608.02] get into it here,
[8608.10 → 8609.00] but I'm sorry that it
[8609.00 → 8609.64] worked out that way,
[8609.68 → 8610.04] basically.
[8610.78 → 8611.86] Um, my daily,
[8612.18 → 8613.38] six days a week bag,
[8613.62 → 8614.20] five stars.
[8614.30 → 8614.86] The point is,
[8614.90 → 8615.92] the people who have it
[8615.92 → 8618.26] flipping love this thing.
[8618.80 → 8619.82] Five stars, five stars.
[8619.96 → 8620.82] Easily the nicest
[8620.82 → 8621.70] backpack of our best
[8621.70 → 8622.68] looking bag I own.
[8622.76 → 8623.64] People talk about
[8623.64 → 8625.44] just getting comments
[8625.44 → 8626.24] on it and people
[8626.24 → 8627.40] asking where it's from.
[8627.48 → 8628.40] It really is,
[8628.48 → 8629.54] it really is an
[8629.54 → 8630.30] attention grabber.
[8630.30 → 8632.78] Um, but we just
[8632.78 → 8633.56] didn't sell that many
[8633.56 → 8635.64] of them and, yeah,
[8635.68 → 8636.42] I, I don't know.
[8636.50 → 8637.04] I don't know if it's
[8637.04 → 8637.38] going to happen.
[8638.02 → 8638.58] I'd like to.
[8638.66 → 8639.14] I'd like to.
[8639.20 → 8639.76] It's a cool product,
[8639.88 → 8641.88] but we have to, we have to
[8641.88 → 8642.96] work on stuff that
[8642.96 → 8643.88] somewhat, you know,
[8643.92 → 8645.22] has a has an
[8645.22 → 8646.30] opportunity to scale.
[8648.02 → 8649.42] What technology would
[8649.42 → 8650.46] you like to see become
[8650.46 → 8651.64] more widespread than
[8651.64 → 8652.24] it is now?
[8654.28 → 8654.48] Hmm.
[8654.84 → 8655.26] I don't know.
[8655.36 → 8656.06] Technology is like
[8656.06 → 8657.52] pretty widespread.
[8659.02 → 8659.46] Um,
[8659.46 → 8662.12] Oh man.
[8663.38 → 8664.48] I'm trying to think
[8664.48 → 8666.06] like, I mean, one of
[8666.06 → 8667.86] them I'm, I'm currently
[8667.86 → 8669.06] investing in.
[8669.32 → 8670.94] I want to see NAS
[8670.94 → 8672.06] become more widespread.
[8672.48 → 8672.66] Yeah.
[8672.88 → 8673.82] Like I think the
[8673.82 → 8675.08] vision behind, I
[8675.08 → 8676.02] think the vision behind
[8676.02 → 8676.96] some of the storage
[8676.96 → 8678.74] coins and stuff was
[8678.74 → 8679.76] actually pretty cool.
[8679.84 → 8680.88] I jumped on that,
[8680.96 → 8681.10] man.
[8681.74 → 8682.94] Um, I really wanted
[8682.94 → 8683.44] that to be a thing.
[8683.46 → 8684.04] For those of you who
[8684.04 → 8684.96] don't know, the idea
[8684.96 → 8686.42] was that you would
[8686.42 → 8687.50] contribute, like you
[8687.50 → 8688.70] would mine the coin
[8688.70 → 8689.40] that like whatever
[8689.40 → 8690.24] the storage coin was,
[8690.28 → 8690.74] I forget what it was
[8690.74 → 8691.30] called, but some
[8691.30 → 8692.36] kind of storage coin
[8692.36 → 8694.94] by providing space
[8694.94 → 8697.76] to like a, a, a
[8697.76 → 8699.38] decentralized cloud
[8699.38 → 8699.94] essentially.
[8700.68 → 8703.04] And, um, then
[8703.04 → 8703.94] people could pay,
[8704.06 → 8705.16] they could buy coins
[8705.16 → 8706.96] in order to back up
[8706.96 → 8707.64] their data to this
[8707.64 → 8708.52] decentralized cloud.
[8708.52 → 8709.72] Uh, I, you know, I'd
[8709.72 → 8710.62] love to see a future
[8710.62 → 8711.70] like that where, where
[8711.70 → 8713.04] NAS is just mainstream
[8713.04 → 8713.78] and like kind of
[8713.78 → 8714.90] everyone has one and
[8714.90 → 8716.52] you just kind of, you
[8716.52 → 8717.38] don't have to just
[8717.38 → 8718.32] surrender your data to
[8718.32 → 8719.02] cloud providers.
[8719.70 → 8721.18] Um, I, Hexes
[8721.18 → 8722.22] hopefully is going to
[8722.22 → 8723.42] be a step towards it
[8723.42 → 8725.22] being easier to, easier
[8725.22 → 8727.00] for, I wouldn't say
[8727.00 → 8728.10] necessarily armies,
[8728.20 → 8729.94] armies yet, but kind
[8729.94 → 8730.88] of tech-savvy people
[8730.88 → 8731.90] like content creators
[8731.90 → 8734.32] and gamers to bring
[8734.32 → 8735.62] their storage on
[8735.62 → 8735.92] prem.
[8735.92 → 8737.68] Um, yeah, I'm going
[8737.68 → 8738.10] to go with that.
[8738.20 → 8738.62] I'm going to go with
[8738.62 → 8738.94] NAS.
[8741.14 → 8741.94] Hi, Mr. Tips.
[8742.36 → 8743.22] It recently came to
[8743.22 → 8744.28] my attention that most
[8744.28 → 8745.54] of the data USB cables
[8745.54 → 8748.62] I have been, what is
[8748.62 → 8749.36] the status of your
[8749.36 → 8750.46] USB-C launch?
[8750.62 → 8752.18] I need like a 10
[8752.18 → 8753.00] gigabit per second
[8753.00 → 8753.30] cable.
[8755.22 → 8755.96] Is he going to do
[8755.96 → 8756.14] it?
[8757.42 → 8757.92] I think he's going to
[8757.92 → 8758.20] do it.
[8762.40 → 8763.58] I had a quick chat
[8763.58 → 8765.14] with Tynan, uh, before
[8765.14 → 8765.88] the show today.
[8765.92 → 8767.36] So we were talking
[8767.36 → 8771.92] about spec versus
[8771.92 → 8773.80] real world observed
[8773.80 → 8775.58] results and talking
[8775.58 → 8777.00] about where the line's
[8777.00 → 8779.44] going to be for, um,
[8779.62 → 8781.50] for our C to Cs, where
[8781.50 → 8782.52] we switch over.
[8782.94 → 8783.72] Tynan says don't talk
[8783.72 → 8784.16] too much.
[8784.48 → 8784.76] Oh.
[8785.74 → 8787.52] Don't talk too much
[8787.52 → 8788.62] to be specific.
[8789.50 → 8791.00] He says it's a bit more
[8791.00 → 8791.88] complicated than I
[8791.88 → 8792.16] thought.
[8792.40 → 8794.30] Oh, okay.
[8794.30 → 8796.32] Well, anyway, I was
[8796.32 → 8798.10] chatting with Tynan and
[8798.10 → 8799.80] this is a cable.
[8801.64 → 8802.70] It's a nice cable.
[8802.90 → 8803.72] It feels great.
[8804.18 → 8807.62] Um, I really love that
[8807.62 → 8808.74] the speeds and feeds are
[8808.74 → 8810.64] printed on the plug.
[8811.14 → 8811.38] Mm-hmm.
[8811.62 → 8812.62] That is so good.
[8812.62 → 8813.42] Not really printed.
[8813.42 → 8814.74] It's like stamped, I guess,
[8815.06 → 8815.98] on the plug.
[8815.98 → 8816.38] Embossed.
[8816.54 → 8817.16] Embossed, sure.
[8817.36 → 8817.72] Thanks, Tim.
[8817.84 → 8821.04] Um, it's, it's so cool
[8821.04 → 8823.04] because a ton of different
[8823.04 → 8824.56] USB cables, they don't even
[8824.56 → 8825.68] tell you when you're buying
[8825.68 → 8827.06] it what the specs are at
[8827.06 → 8827.36] all.
[8827.92 → 8829.38] Uh, and then if they do
[8829.38 → 8830.16] tell you when you're buying
[8830.16 → 8831.00] it, it's just on the box.
[8831.08 → 8831.76] You take the cable out of
[8831.76 → 8832.62] the box, and it's gone.
[8832.68 → 8833.38] You'll never know again.
[8833.58 → 8833.74] Yep.
[8833.74 → 8835.22] Um, so.
[8835.34 → 8836.06] It's just permanently on
[8836.06 → 8836.16] there.
[8836.20 → 8838.20] We just have the watts and
[8838.20 → 8839.92] the speed embossed onto
[8839.92 → 8840.82] both ends.
[8841.34 → 8841.68] Awesome.
[8841.80 → 8843.36] So you can never mistake
[8843.36 → 8844.56] what the capabilities of the
[8844.56 → 8845.00] cable are.
[8845.24 → 8846.60] This one, which I'm not
[8846.60 → 8847.50] going to show you the full
[8847.50 → 8848.64] length of because I don't
[8848.64 → 8849.72] know if we'll be able to
[8849.72 → 8852.96] deliver this length at this
[8852.96 → 8853.50] speed.
[8853.66 → 8855.20] This is a 20 gigabit per
[8855.20 → 8856.92] second, 240 watt cable.
[8857.18 → 8859.38] As you can see, she is
[8859.38 → 8860.18] thick.
[8860.66 → 8862.20] Like she, like I've got
[8862.20 → 8863.60] this, I've got this cable
[8863.60 → 8866.22] like she is, she's thick
[8866.22 → 8866.66] boys.
[8866.92 → 8870.90] So I've got this USB-C, um,
[8871.34 → 8872.62] width wise and length wise
[8872.62 → 8872.78] here.
[8872.82 → 8874.70] So you could see it is like
[8874.70 → 8876.10] as thick as the entire
[8876.10 → 8877.82] housing is going in there.
[8877.82 → 8878.76] Like she's so thick.
[8878.88 → 8880.14] We don't even need a strain
[8880.14 → 8881.24] relief necessarily.
[8881.24 → 8882.42] Like we've got a little bit
[8882.42 → 8883.58] of one kind of built into
[8883.58 → 8884.60] the, uh, the moulding for
[8884.60 → 8886.20] the housing, but she's just,
[8886.60 → 8888.38] she's just only got so much
[8888.38 → 8889.66] turn radio, but it still
[8889.66 → 8892.14] does that fairly nicely.
[8892.14 → 8893.46] Well, the reason for that
[8893.46 → 8895.26] is that we're using, so in
[8895.26 → 8896.40] spite of the fact that they
[8896.40 → 8897.92] are, they are coaxial
[8897.92 → 8899.72] conductors inside here
[8899.72 → 8900.92] rather than twisted pair
[8900.92 → 8903.66] because only the finest for
[8903.66 → 8906.16] our, for our, um, loyal
[8906.16 → 8906.76] customers.
[8907.44 → 8910.26] Um, where was I going with
[8910.26 → 8910.66] that again?
[8910.76 → 8911.00] Right.
[8911.48 → 8912.70] We have coaxed in there,
[8912.82 → 8913.64] something, something.
[8914.02 → 8914.30] Shoot.
[8914.30 → 8915.36] I was talking about how it,
[8915.36 → 8916.92] it, it works around nicely.
[8917.02 → 8917.18] Right.
[8917.24 → 8918.90] So the way that we managed
[8918.90 → 8921.52] to make them supple anyway,
[8921.52 → 8923.88] and like, like floppy doodle
[8923.88 → 8925.86] is that we're using, um, a
[8925.86 → 8927.40] very similar to silicone
[8927.40 → 8930.04] style sleeving to what you
[8930.04 → 8931.44] would find on like hobbyist
[8931.44 → 8932.36] grade wiring.
[8932.94 → 8935.48] Um, so they're, they're just
[8935.48 → 8936.60] going to have like a like
[8936.60 → 8938.16] that really nice kind of soft
[8938.16 → 8940.00] touch feel, and they should be
[8940.00 → 8942.38] extremely resilient against, uh,
[8942.40 → 8944.78] UV, uh, as well as just, you
[8944.78 → 8946.50] know, the, the, the ravages
[8946.50 → 8947.28] of time.
[8948.46 → 8954.48] Um, as for some of the very,
[8954.48 → 8959.46] very detailed questions, um, I
[8959.46 → 8960.98] am I going to leave that to
[8960.98 → 8961.46] Tynan.
[8961.92 → 8962.16] Yeah.
[8962.28 → 8963.08] He's in full point chat.
[8963.22 → 8963.46] Yeah.
[8964.20 → 8965.44] I just unplugged my head.
[8965.44 → 8967.18] And maybe, maybe we can talk
[8967.18 → 8969.62] more publicly about stuff, uh,
[8969.62 → 8970.72] later when things are a little
[8970.72 → 8971.66] bit more locked in, but not
[8971.66 → 8971.94] right now.
[8972.10 → 8973.50] So anything, yeah, anything
[8973.50 → 8975.08] Tynan is willing to kind of
[8975.08 → 8975.98] talk about in the float
[8975.98 → 8978.08] plane chat, um, I'm willing to
[8978.08 → 8979.42] let him talk about because
[8979.42 → 8980.78] realistically he's probably
[8980.78 → 8982.18] going to be a little more
[8982.18 → 8984.16] conservative in terms of, you
[8984.16 → 8985.28] know what he'll say.
[8985.46 → 8987.00] Um, and he also is the most
[8987.00 → 8987.98] knowledgeable one on the
[8987.98 → 8989.12] team about this project.
[8989.38 → 8990.98] All I'll say for now is I'm
[8990.98 → 8994.62] really excited because I think
[8994.62 → 8996.38] there's, I think there's room
[8996.38 → 8997.68] in the market for this
[8997.68 → 8998.06] product.
[8998.06 → 9000.26] Uh, I think that from what
[9000.26 → 9002.88] I've seen, there are premium
[9002.88 → 9004.86] cables, but I don't think the
[9004.86 → 9006.30] pricing is reasonable.
[9006.62 → 9008.14] There are a lot of cheap
[9008.14 → 9010.28] cables that I think are being
[9010.28 → 9012.72] marked up extremely high and
[9012.72 → 9014.08] the build quality of them is
[9014.08 → 9015.06] extremely low.
[9015.26 → 9017.06] I think that there is room for
[9017.80 → 9020.94] an extremely premium cable.
[9021.34 → 9022.78] It's not the last thing you'll
[9022.78 → 9024.18] ever buy to a degree.
[9024.32 → 9025.06] Cables are consumable.
[9025.06 → 9025.92] Yeah.
[9026.18 → 9027.76] They connectors are, they're
[9027.76 → 9029.76] rated for insertions and, and,
[9029.76 → 9031.34] and, and, you know, strain and
[9031.34 → 9032.10] like all that stuff.
[9032.18 → 9033.12] Nothing is going to last
[9033.12 → 9034.72] forever, but I think there's
[9034.72 → 9036.06] room for a very premium
[9036.74 → 9039.44] manufactured cable, very high
[9039.44 → 9041.34] quality materials, good
[9041.34 → 9043.68] shielding, um, good design
[9043.68 → 9045.94] choices cable that is not
[9045.94 → 9048.54] ridiculously expensive due to an
[9048.54 → 9049.68] extremely high markup.
[9049.68 → 9051.40] Uh, we're going to mark them
[9051.40 → 9052.60] up in such a way that this will
[9052.60 → 9053.92] be a sustainable business for
[9053.92 → 9054.14] us.
[9054.22 → 9056.68] But I think that much like our
[9056.68 → 9057.72] magnetic cable management,
[9057.72 → 9058.04] right?
[9058.28 → 9059.80] Which seems like an obvious
[9059.80 → 9061.16] product for someone to clone,
[9061.90 → 9062.46] right?
[9062.76 → 9063.60] Like, why wouldn't you just
[9063.60 → 9063.94] clone it?
[9063.94 → 9065.16] It's just a plastic arch with a
[9065.16 → 9065.74] magnet in it.
[9066.18 → 9068.46] It's really hard to clone it
[9068.46 → 9070.78] because the cost is in the
[9070.78 → 9071.46] neodymium.
[9071.46 → 9073.76] Um, so unless you just make a
[9073.76 → 9075.28] worse product, you're not
[9075.28 → 9076.64] going to be able to clone it
[9076.64 → 9077.92] and outcompete us on price.
[9078.24 → 9081.24] So in much the same way, yeah,
[9081.24 → 9083.24] you can build a cable that's
[9083.24 → 9084.94] like cheaper, or you can
[9084.94 → 9087.40] whatever, but these are,
[9087.80 → 9090.06] there's just a lot of copper
[9090.06 → 9090.42] in them.
[9091.44 → 9092.92] There's just a lot of shielding
[9092.92 → 9093.20] in them.
[9093.58 → 9093.68] Yeah.
[9094.02 → 9095.76] Um, so I think, I think this is
[9095.76 → 9096.54] going to be something that's
[9096.54 → 9098.36] going to be really appealing to
[9098.36 → 9102.18] the folks who are willing to
[9102.18 → 9103.66] sort of buy once, cry once
[9103.66 → 9105.22] with their cables and everyone
[9105.22 → 9106.30] else kind of need not apply.
[9107.32 → 9107.54] Yeah.
[9108.40 → 9109.56] You might not need super fancy
[9109.56 → 9110.76] cables is what it is.
[9111.02 → 9113.42] Top Gear says order double your
[9113.42 → 9114.48] initial predicted quantity.
[9114.62 → 9115.86] You will blow them out in the
[9115.86 → 9116.40] first week.
[9116.68 → 9118.96] That's what I think, but I have,
[9119.04 → 9122.02] um, I have not, um, had a lot
[9122.02 → 9123.68] of success communicating my
[9123.68 → 9125.04] confidence to some of the other
[9125.04 → 9125.72] members of the team.
[9125.72 → 9127.48] And this is where, this is where
[9127.48 → 9129.56] like, you know, consensus is
[9129.56 → 9131.26] important, and it's not as simple
[9131.26 → 9134.60] as me just like whipping it
[9134.60 → 9139.56] out and being like, just buy it.
[9139.56 → 9139.78] Right.
[9139.80 → 9141.76] Because other people's KPIs are
[9141.76 → 9143.70] tied to managing stock on the
[9143.70 → 9145.68] store, and it could be running a
[9145.68 → 9146.50] reasonable business.
[9146.50 → 9148.20] It just is because of personal
[9148.20 → 9149.34] rules, which is good.
[9151.56 → 9151.96] Yeah.
[9153.00 → 9153.40] Yeah.
[9153.72 → 9155.80] I mean, I did kind of pull it a
[9155.80 → 9156.60] little bit with this one.
[9156.78 → 9157.00] Yeah.
[9157.00 → 9158.06] Because they wanted to order
[9158.06 → 9160.56] fewer SKUs instead of having
[9160.56 → 9162.14] more granularity in the links.
[9162.34 → 9165.18] And I was like, what's the dollar
[9165.18 → 9166.12] value on this?
[9166.74 → 9167.84] Just fucking order them.
[9167.90 → 9168.78] Like, I don't want to talk about
[9168.78 → 9169.26] this anymore.
[9169.34 → 9170.70] Every once in a while I will pull
[9170.70 → 9172.56] that card just because time
[9172.56 → 9175.00] efficiency to me, part of the
[9175.00 → 9176.98] value of this product is that
[9176.98 → 9178.18] we're going to have different
[9178.18 → 9179.64] lengths and I want it to be a
[9179.64 → 9181.08] perfect companion product for
[9181.08 → 9182.42] our cable management products.
[9182.42 → 9184.88] So I want, when we're doing stuff
[9184.88 → 9186.10] like Setup Doctor, I want us to
[9186.10 → 9187.24] have the right length like a
[9187.24 → 9187.50] cable.
[9187.88 → 9188.20] Right.
[9188.30 → 9189.32] So there's, there are business
[9189.32 → 9190.82] reasons for it aside from just
[9190.82 → 9193.06] like, sorry, how many dollars is
[9193.06 → 9193.26] this?
[9193.32 → 9195.44] Just put it on, just put it on the
[9195.44 → 9195.96] corporate card.
[9196.04 → 9196.62] We'll deal with it later.
[9196.68 → 9197.50] You know, it's not, it's not
[9197.50 → 9198.06] entirely that.
[9198.12 → 9199.28] Like I did have reasons for it,
[9199.36 → 9201.26] but yes, yes.
[9201.34 → 9202.36] Cancelled Netflix for this.
[9202.42 → 9203.52] We're going to have, we're going to
[9203.52 → 9204.94] try to have lots of different
[9204.94 → 9206.34] lengths so that you can have a
[9206.34 → 9207.56] nice, tightly managed setup.
[9207.56 → 9208.88] That's their username.
[9209.54 → 9210.54] Cancelled Netflix for this.
[9210.62 → 9210.96] That's good.
[9211.26 → 9211.60] Love it.
[9211.70 → 9212.50] I thought for a second, I was
[9212.50 → 9213.92] like, did they cancel Netflix to
[9213.92 → 9215.16] save money for the cables?
[9215.26 → 9216.04] Like what are they talking
[9216.04 → 9216.28] about?
[9217.06 → 9217.30] Anyway.
[9219.82 → 9220.88] Couldn't you just do a pre-order
[9220.88 → 9221.18] thing?
[9221.36 → 9222.46] Pre-orders are tough because it
[9222.46 → 9223.34] means we're taking your money
[9223.34 → 9223.76] now.
[9224.36 → 9225.68] You're not going to get it until
[9225.68 → 9226.62] Lord knows how long.
[9226.66 → 9227.52] Like what if we run into an
[9227.52 → 9227.70] issue?
[9228.06 → 9229.12] Like what if our supplier
[9229.12 → 9230.78] completely screws us over?
[9230.78 → 9232.06] Like we had with the ratchet on
[9232.06 → 9232.54] the screwdriver.
[9232.86 → 9233.32] Not the ratchet.
[9233.56 → 9234.36] No shielding.
[9234.88 → 9235.08] Yeah.
[9235.24 → 9235.42] Yeah.
[9235.42 → 9236.88] What if we get the initial order in
[9236.88 → 9238.74] and it's like, oh my God, they
[9238.74 → 9240.42] produced the whole thing wrong
[9240.42 → 9241.48] or something like that.
[9241.54 → 9243.98] Like it's just, it's so much,
[9244.16 → 9245.68] my life is so much better if I
[9245.68 → 9246.72] just don't have your money.
[9246.92 → 9248.52] Honestly, I don't need it yet.
[9248.66 → 9250.74] I only need it once I have
[9250.74 → 9252.66] something of value to exchange
[9252.66 → 9253.18] for it.
[9253.24 → 9254.40] I don't, I don't need it now.
[9254.48 → 9255.44] I just need it later.
[9255.72 → 9255.86] Yeah.
[9258.44 → 9261.28] I'm so excited about this though.
[9261.60 → 9262.66] They're very nice.
[9263.04 → 9264.24] I just, people are going to,
[9264.24 → 9265.16] people are going to see the
[9265.16 → 9266.44] price, and they're going to be
[9266.44 → 9267.54] like, that's insane.
[9268.18 → 9269.54] Who'd be insane enough to buy a
[9269.54 → 9270.34] cable from LTT?
[9270.56 → 9271.64] LTT is overpriced.
[9271.76 → 9272.52] They're, they're garbage.
[9272.66 → 9273.86] They're YouTuber tax, blah, blah,
[9273.92 → 9274.62] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[9274.90 → 9276.60] And then the people who get it
[9276.60 → 9278.08] are going to order it, and they're
[9278.08 → 9279.44] going to touch this thing and
[9279.44 → 9280.96] they're going to be like, holy crap.
[9282.58 → 9284.20] Are you kidding me right now?
[9285.94 → 9288.14] Have you ever held a USB cable
[9288.14 → 9288.64] like this?
[9288.74 → 9288.82] No.
[9289.74 → 9291.30] That's because no one is insane
[9291.30 → 9291.72] enough.
[9291.90 → 9293.18] I'm so curious to make this.
[9293.18 → 9294.28] To know how much they're going to
[9294.28 → 9294.56] cost.
[9294.56 → 9295.22] I have no idea.
[9295.50 → 9296.12] Today's today.
[9296.22 → 9298.32] This is not right now, but yeah,
[9298.38 → 9299.64] today is the first day that I've
[9299.64 → 9300.10] seen these.
[9300.82 → 9302.70] People are going to hold these
[9302.70 → 9304.52] and they're just going to be like,
[9304.56 → 9305.90] this is beyond compare.
[9306.08 → 9307.68] It might seem stupid, but the
[9307.68 → 9309.40] embossed thing on the plug
[9309.40 → 9312.74] is like worth money.
[9312.86 → 9313.76] There are other brands that do it.
[9313.98 → 9314.76] We're not the only ones.
[9314.82 → 9316.32] We're one of the few ones, but we
[9316.32 → 9317.46] aren't the only ones who do that.
[9317.56 → 9318.56] I haven't personally seen it,
[9318.66 → 9320.92] but there's, there's, there's more
[9320.92 → 9322.18] to it than just that.
[9322.40 → 9322.90] Oh, of course.
[9323.10 → 9323.26] Yeah.
[9323.26 → 9324.46] I just like that part a lot.
[9324.76 → 9326.38] Because I find it super frustrating
[9326.38 → 9327.66] digging through cables and be like,
[9327.76 → 9329.62] I have no idea what almost any of
[9329.62 → 9330.56] these really are.
[9330.60 → 9331.68] It's just that the cable industry
[9331.68 → 9333.76] expects like ridiculous margins.
[9333.96 → 9334.18] Yeah.
[9334.18 → 9336.12] Um, and so we're coming in it, we're
[9336.12 → 9337.10] coming in, and we're kind of going,
[9337.20 → 9338.30] okay, well, like we have a model
[9338.30 → 9342.00] where our margin is sustainable and we
[9342.00 → 9344.38] think that there is a there's room
[9344.38 → 9346.66] for us to take our margin model and
[9346.66 → 9349.08] bring it to a category where no one's
[9349.08 → 9350.98] really building a product that meets
[9350.98 → 9352.80] our quality expectations and.
[9353.82 → 9354.26] Yeah.
[9354.26 → 9354.40] Yeah.
[9354.44 → 9354.92] See what happens.
[9355.04 → 9355.58] See what happens.
[9355.78 → 9356.02] Cool.
[9357.02 → 9358.46] See what happens.
[9359.36 → 9361.28] Um, Tynan says we aren't looking into
[9361.28 → 9362.54] lightning, even though I have an iPhone
[9362.54 → 9363.10] that uses it.
[9363.16 → 9363.74] That is true.
[9363.74 → 9364.92] Lightning is the past.
[9365.34 → 9368.72] And I think that probably, um, we
[9368.72 → 9370.82] would have other priorities like HDMI
[9370.82 → 9373.58] and DisplayPort beyond USB that would
[9373.58 → 9374.56] come before lightning.
[9375.72 → 9376.28] Yeah.
[9376.64 → 9376.86] Yeah.
[9377.00 → 9379.52] I know USB cables are cool, but you get
[9379.52 → 9382.22] some like really sick HDMI DisplayPort
[9382.22 → 9382.62] cables.
[9383.80 → 9384.12] Hmm.
[9385.34 → 9385.82] Yeah.
[9386.26 → 9386.38] Yeah.
[9386.58 → 9386.80] Yep.
[9386.86 → 9387.32] Don't worry.
[9387.46 → 9388.94] We'll sell some of those.
[9389.02 → 9390.46] Even though they just say what they
[9390.46 → 9390.96] are on them.
[9391.22 → 9392.64] Oh, I know.
[9392.64 → 9392.88] Right.
[9392.88 → 9393.52] Ooh.
[9394.48 → 9395.22] It's going to be good.
[9395.46 → 9395.98] I'm excited.
[9396.14 → 9397.08] VGA cables win.
[9397.58 → 9399.58] As someone who's going to start hosting
[9399.58 → 9402.76] game servers and other, I ask, what
[9402.76 → 9405.20] would you like to see out of cloud
[9405.20 → 9405.82] providers?
[9405.82 → 9410.40] I don't know.
[9411.12 → 9411.96] Stability and price.
[9412.14 → 9412.28] Sure.
[9412.36 → 9415.12] That's a that's a fairly solved game, I
[9415.12 → 9415.38] think.
[9415.50 → 9415.70] All right.
[9416.14 → 9416.50] Archived.
[9417.24 → 9417.64] Sorry.
[9418.04 → 9418.32] Gone.
[9418.92 → 9420.40] Hello, my par asocial friends.
[9420.66 → 9423.02] Linus, how is your bike painting project going?
[9423.20 → 9423.40] Oh.
[9423.48 → 9423.66] Yeah.
[9424.22 → 9425.36] Finish it up, dude.
[9425.46 → 9426.32] We want the beard.
[9426.44 → 9427.24] What's going on?
[9427.28 → 9429.52] I haven't touched it in ages.
[9429.64 → 9430.30] I didn't touch it.
[9430.38 → 9431.82] How could you be that rude to Yvonne?
[9431.82 → 9432.82] What?
[9436.24 → 9437.18] She wants the beard.
[9437.28 → 9437.50] Yeah.
[9437.90 → 9439.04] She said in her video.
[9439.04 → 9439.50] Oh, you forgot that.
[9439.56 → 9439.78] Okay.
[9439.92 → 9440.08] Yeah.
[9440.16 → 9440.34] Yeah.
[9440.34 → 9440.46] Yeah.
[9440.46 → 9440.58] Yeah.
[9440.58 → 9445.54] I thought you meant like, I thought you were going like, uh, like an I haven't like jacked
[9445.54 → 9446.10] it in ages.
[9446.10 → 9448.66] So that's like disrespectful to her or something.
[9448.78 → 9449.80] I was like, what are you talking?
[9450.18 → 9450.62] No.
[9452.94 → 9453.38] Okay.
[9453.42 → 9453.98] That makes sense.
[9454.36 → 9454.52] Yeah.
[9454.52 → 9457.08] In the Yvonne week thing we watched today.
[9457.08 → 9457.38] Yeah.
[9457.38 → 9457.58] Yeah.
[9457.58 → 9457.68] Yeah.
[9457.68 → 9458.00] Okay.
[9458.60 → 9458.84] Yeah.
[9458.84 → 9459.04] Yeah.
[9459.04 → 9459.24] Yeah.
[9460.24 → 9460.68] Yeah.
[9462.82 → 9466.08] I'm, I'm in a lot of pain right now.
[9466.40 → 9468.28] Ah, I have tennis elbow.
[9468.54 → 9471.04] I still have residual sprained ankle.
[9471.28 → 9473.14] I pulled my back in that tournament.
[9473.14 → 9477.30] Um, I need to go easy on my body for a little bit.
[9477.54 → 9477.62] Yeah.
[9477.70 → 9481.98] And I'm kind of thinking maybe instead of hitting the gym and badminton so much.
[9482.06 → 9482.90] Do some bike painting.
[9482.90 → 9484.36] I might do some bike painting for a bit.
[9484.42 → 9484.62] Cool.
[9484.80 → 9484.96] Yeah.
[9485.40 → 9485.76] Nice.
[9486.54 → 9487.06] Hey, DLL.
[9487.18 → 9490.44] Are you guys excited for any of the booths that will be at CES?
[9490.62 → 9493.42] I always enjoy watching the videos of the new monitor technology.
[9493.66 → 9494.18] Love the show.
[9494.78 → 9497.10] I can't tell you anything I'm excited to see.
[9497.22 → 9498.18] I'm excited for.
[9498.42 → 9499.26] Probably embargoed.
[9499.32 → 9500.98] Multiple things that I can't tell you about.
[9500.98 → 9503.56] But, um, yes.
[9503.82 → 9504.48] Oh, I'm going.
[9505.26 → 9506.62] For the first time in a while.
[9506.80 → 9507.44] Quite a while.
[9507.52 → 9507.72] Yeah.
[9508.14 → 9511.14] Not super excited about that part.
[9511.20 → 9512.00] Let's go Las Vegas.
[9512.16 → 9512.88] Don't like Vegas.
[9513.66 → 9514.90] Viva, Viva Las Vegas.
[9515.22 → 9515.54] Yep.
[9515.72 → 9516.38] I'm going too.
[9517.26 → 9517.92] Dan's going?
[9518.14 → 9519.10] I'm going for vacation.
[9519.30 → 9520.00] Oh, what?
[9520.00 → 9520.22] Yeah.
[9520.58 → 9521.46] I've never been before.
[9521.52 → 9522.08] I'm super excited.
[9522.26 → 9522.50] Okay.
[9522.64 → 9522.90] All right.
[9523.00 → 9523.16] Yeah.
[9524.04 → 9524.44] Sure.
[9524.54 → 9525.08] Quote unquote.
[9525.22 → 9525.44] Yeah.
[9525.66 → 9527.60] I assume Luke was like, don't bother.
[9527.94 → 9528.14] Okay.
[9528.14 → 9528.88] Do you like shows though?
[9528.98 → 9531.60] Like, do you like theatre and shows?
[9531.72 → 9532.56] I want to go to CES.
[9532.84 → 9534.14] I'm into, I'm into technology.
[9534.22 → 9534.62] I work here.
[9536.14 → 9539.00] I want to see the Super Micros branding material.
[9542.30 → 9543.22] Shut up, both of you.
[9543.22 → 9543.92] Let's do more.
[9543.92 → 9545.74] The show floor is like so disappointing.
[9546.18 → 9548.82] If you really want to see one of those shows, you should have gone to Compute.
[9548.82 → 9552.24] I did NAB, which was super dry.
[9553.04 → 9553.42] It's cool.
[9553.70 → 9554.08] You know what?
[9554.12 → 9558.50] I have never actually attended CES as just like an attendee.
[9559.02 → 9561.40] So maybe that's part of the problem for me.
[9561.58 → 9562.96] There is cool stuff there.
[9562.96 → 9568.94] Like if you're just going around and just like, and because he gets to wear a Linus Media Group badge.
[9569.16 → 9569.30] Nope.
[9569.52 → 9569.76] Nope.
[9569.98 → 9570.98] I'm not going for the company.
[9571.18 → 9572.48] He has a different invite.
[9573.12 → 9573.46] What?
[9573.78 → 9576.36] Because I'm not going on your behalf.
[9576.36 → 9580.84] Oh, I just assumed you would just badge up with Linus Media Group, so people will talk to you.
[9581.48 → 9582.42] I don't want to get talked to.
[9582.56 → 9583.30] Oh, I mean.
[9583.32 → 9584.14] I just want to hang out.
[9584.60 → 9585.54] It's also Vegas.
[9585.54 → 9585.84] Good luck.
[9586.06 → 9587.04] You guys don't like Vegas.
[9587.12 → 9587.70] Good luck.
[9587.84 → 9593.12] You have any idea what percentage of the people watching this show are going to be at CES, Dan?
[9593.26 → 9595.08] Like you're not going anywhere.
[9595.66 → 9596.86] I'm not walking anywhere.
[9597.24 → 9598.50] I need to buy a mask.
[9598.54 → 9598.94] Wear a mask.
[9598.96 → 9599.62] Oh, crap.
[9599.74 → 9601.04] I keep forgetting I work here.
[9601.04 → 9606.04] I think I'm realizing I don't think I've ever traversed the CES show floor when not like either speed walking
[9606.36 → 9608.62] or tactically manoeuvring through a crowd.
[9608.80 → 9609.36] Like I haven't really...
[9610.46 → 9613.50] When I see things, it's because I'm glancing at them when I'm walking by.
[9613.66 → 9616.02] But when I see things, it's foam cases.
[9616.66 → 9617.06] Dan?
[9617.82 → 9618.50] That sounds cool.
[9618.76 → 9619.44] Oh, why?
[9619.58 → 9621.02] There's been a lot of development in that sector.
[9621.04 → 9621.64] You're lying.
[9622.48 → 9623.50] It's also Vegas.
[9623.88 → 9624.38] I don't know.
[9624.66 → 9625.50] You like Vegas?
[9625.86 → 9626.44] It's okay.
[9626.66 → 9627.38] It used to be better.
[9627.70 → 9628.36] Now it's...
[9628.36 → 9629.04] What does that mean?
[9629.86 → 9630.58] I don't know.
[9630.58 → 9632.16] It's not as adult anymore.
[9632.80 → 9632.96] Oh.
[9633.78 → 9634.14] Oh.
[9634.56 → 9642.04] Yeah, they tried to family friendly it up because like post-COVID, they lost a lot of money,
[9642.24 → 9642.52] right?
[9642.98 → 9647.78] It used to be more like bars and like gambling, and now it's like things to do with your kids
[9647.78 → 9649.58] because please come to Vegas and spend money.
[9650.18 → 9650.66] You know what I mean?
[9651.72 → 9654.60] That seems weird because a lot of other places are going the opposite direction.
[9654.98 → 9657.78] Like people are talking about how Disneyland is like for adults now and stuff.
[9657.78 → 9658.12] Yeah.
[9658.54 → 9661.68] Apparently child-free spaces in like South Korea are like huge.
[9662.12 → 9662.76] It's weird.
[9662.76 → 9663.16] Yeah.
[9663.36 → 9665.78] I mean, that makes sense looking at their population.
[9666.24 → 9666.54] Yeah.
[9666.80 → 9667.30] Just dads.
[9668.78 → 9669.02] Okay.
[9669.44 → 9669.62] Cool.
[9670.34 → 9676.24] Why does my company only allow us to use Wi-Fi with VPN and not Ethernet for quote-unquote
[9676.24 → 9676.72] security?
[9677.06 → 9678.38] I have no idea.
[9679.32 → 9684.38] That does not make any sense to me other than that maybe your network administrator is just
[9684.38 → 9685.70] like stupid.
[9685.70 → 9690.18] I don't want to deal with the cable runs or something.
[9690.72 → 9691.18] You'd have to do that.
[9691.18 → 9695.24] Well, it's that they won't let them use the VPN when they're connected with a wire, but
[9695.24 → 9697.22] they can use it when they're on Wi-Fi.
[9697.62 → 9697.88] What?
[9698.30 → 9703.12] Like maybe just like whatever their infrastructure is, they've taken some kind of shortcut that's
[9703.12 → 9709.50] built into their like wireless management thing instead of doing it at like a router level
[9709.50 → 9714.08] or something like that's the only thing I can think of is if it's is it's only if they've
[9714.08 → 9720.78] only implemented something at the like Wi-Fi controller level or something.
[9720.90 → 9721.40] I don't know.
[9721.78 → 9724.94] I understand you're just trying to figure it out, but that would be so weird.
[9725.28 → 9725.66] I know.
[9725.66 → 9727.24] No, I get it.
[9727.24 → 9727.46] I get it.
[9727.46 → 9728.98] That's the only reason I could think of.
[9728.98 → 9729.00] For sure.
[9729.10 → 9729.38] Yeah, I know.
[9729.58 → 9729.94] I...
[9729.94 → 9734.24] Why did all hotels rip the Ethernet jacks out of the rooms?
[9734.72 → 9736.80] They were already fucking there.
[9737.44 → 9737.68] Yeah.
[9737.80 → 9739.02] Why did they take them out?
[9739.28 → 9740.42] It's just copper.
[9740.96 → 9744.16] Just leave it there so I can have a reliable connection.
[9745.28 → 9745.80] I don't know.
[9746.10 → 9746.60] I don't know.
[9746.68 → 9747.84] I don't understand it.
[9750.10 → 9750.96] Hey, EDO.
[9751.22 → 9754.88] Is there a type of video you would have made 10 years ago that you wish you could make
[9754.88 → 9757.02] today, but it wouldn't perform well on YouTube?
[9758.22 → 9759.28] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[9759.36 → 9764.72] I mean, just like the low-key, like, hey, check out this, like, random thing I'm working on.
[9764.90 → 9766.08] Okay, here's an example.
[9770.08 → 9771.04] Coolie Boreas.
[9772.32 → 9773.36] Like, check this out.
[9776.76 → 9777.48] Oh, man.
[9777.80 → 9778.98] I can't even...
[9778.98 → 9780.66] I can't even find this.
[9781.40 → 9782.08] Oh, yeah, here we go.
[9782.20 → 9784.86] People are saying, like, yeah, like, our firewall doesn't let you connect.
[9784.88 → 9789.34] It's like, okay, but then it shouldn't let you do it on Wi-Fi either.
[9789.52 → 9790.92] Like, I can understand that use case.
[9792.34 → 9797.30] Like, I was just like, oh, yeah, here's, like, two tech coolers, and I, like, hooked them
[9797.30 → 9799.18] up to, like, a weird thing.
[9799.44 → 9800.80] No, this would totally work now.
[9800.94 → 9801.22] No.
[9801.46 → 9802.52] This would 100% work now.
[9802.62 → 9802.76] No.
[9802.76 → 9805.58] You just need to do it with Alex, and it would need to be, like...
[9805.58 → 9808.40] Yeah, but this is just me holding it and, like, just, like, showing what I'm, like...
[9808.40 → 9813.72] Yeah, but this is the like, filming quality and the production quality, not the concept.
[9813.94 → 9815.38] This concept would do just fine now.
[9815.86 → 9816.82] Yeah, I don't know.
[9817.16 → 9817.72] It would do fine.
[9818.92 → 9819.28] Yeah.
[9819.56 → 9820.46] You and Alex could do it.
[9821.00 → 9821.26] Yeah.
[9822.96 → 9824.12] Hybrid technology.
[9824.34 → 9824.86] Zip ties.
[9824.86 → 9827.62] Yeah, we've never really changed, have we?
[9827.78 → 9828.00] No.
[9828.14 → 9829.00] 14 years ago.
[9829.24 → 9829.46] Yeah.
[9831.34 → 9835.22] Any tech tips on cleaning the bearings in the Precision screwdriver?
[9835.44 → 9839.32] Mine has a 60-plus second spin and quickly went to 30.
[9839.50 → 9844.32] After adding a tad bit of oil as recommended to a hybrid bearing, it's now...
[9844.32 → 9846.08] I don't know if it's better or worse.
[9846.60 → 9847.64] Cut off?
[9847.66 → 9848.68] It just stops there.
[9848.68 → 9849.24] It's now...
[9849.24 → 9850.18] Oh, that's hilarious.
[9851.38 → 9852.20] It's now.
[9853.12 → 9854.14] Character capping.
[9854.14 → 9855.34] Okay.
[9857.26 → 9857.86] No?
[9858.48 → 9859.56] I don't know.
[9860.46 → 9863.44] That's a good question for support.
[9863.62 → 9864.62] Tynan said it's a struggle.
[9865.12 → 9866.80] Or this a struggle, to be exact.
[9867.72 → 9870.46] Yeah, I mean, bearings are...
[9870.46 → 9873.50] There's a reason we don't guarantee a particular spin length.
[9873.74 → 9876.88] And we do definitely know that there is some variance.
[9876.88 → 9880.18] And yes, lubrication can be helpful.
[9880.18 → 9884.40] Tynan said, cleaning that bearing is a struggle.
[9884.58 → 9888.78] The amount of inertia for the end cap means that anything in there will slow it down.
[9889.46 → 9889.60] Yeah.
[9889.74 → 9891.00] Like, we don't have our...
[9891.00 → 9895.02] Like, we want to do, like, heavy, like, more fidget spinner end caps at some point.
[9895.04 → 9896.12] But we haven't done that yet.
[9896.14 → 9897.04] And those are pretty light.
[9898.12 → 9898.28] Yeah.
[9898.28 → 9899.24] Even dust, I guess.
[9899.24 → 9901.58] I-L-L-D.
[9901.76 → 9903.22] Linus is the DOG Ally.
[9903.40 → 9905.10] Still your main portable gaming console.
[9905.34 → 9906.56] Current games on it?
[9907.02 → 9908.66] Checked out DOG Ally when?
[9910.22 → 9914.02] It's my main in the sense that it's still the one that sits on my nightstand.
[9914.08 → 9915.64] But I haven't really been using it much lately.
[9916.04 → 9916.24] So...
[9916.24 → 9920.18] What did I fire up the other day?
[9920.26 → 9925.38] It was this weird game where you're, like, on a boat and you, like, manage stuff and you, like, fight stuff or something.
[9925.46 → 9925.82] I don't know.
[9925.94 → 9929.08] But I got a bunch of stuff in the Steam still that I've been meaning to pick up.
[9929.14 → 9930.10] But I just haven't had time.
[9930.16 → 9931.50] Like, I haven't even had time to paint my bike.
[9931.60 → 9932.94] How can I justify playing video games?
[9934.94 → 9936.02] Hi, Waldo Devil.
[9936.42 → 9937.42] What is the most...
[9937.42 → 9937.62] Ding.
[9937.86 → 9937.96] Oh.
[9938.16 → 9938.58] Hold on.
[9938.86 → 9940.28] And just to clear something up.
[9941.08 → 9942.28] Yeah, I think it is called Dredge.
[9942.40 → 9944.28] I was going to say, a ton of people just said Dredge.
[9944.38 → 9944.54] Yeah.
[9944.54 → 9946.24] Just to clear things up.
[9946.66 → 9949.22] It's not because necessarily the Ally is the best.
[9949.36 → 9953.98] Like, if I was picking the thing that I like the most, Steam Deck OLED is sick.
[9954.16 → 9956.72] Or if I wanted more performance, I like the Ally X right now.
[9957.02 → 9959.82] There's also might be some new stuff coming soon.
[9960.48 → 9963.30] But just the Ally, like, has my stuff on it.
[9963.64 → 9965.38] And so I haven't bothered changing it.
[9965.76 → 9965.92] Okay.
[9966.80 → 9969.70] What is the most dangerous moment you've had showing off a piece of tech?
[9969.88 → 9973.24] Like a hoverboard that shot out from under you or something going haywire?
[9973.24 → 9975.16] Oh, I mean...
[9975.16 → 9977.22] I probably don't even remember them at this point.
[9977.48 → 9980.62] Like, there's definitely been some dangerous stuff.
[9980.70 → 9986.38] I've never had something just, like, almost, you know, hit me in the head or something like that.
[9986.66 → 9990.32] I had a Drexel saw blade get stuck in the face mask that I was using.
[9991.18 → 9992.46] Or strike it or something.
[9993.12 → 9997.00] It broke, and it did something with the face mask.
[9997.06 → 9998.46] It was so long ago, I don't remember the exact details.
[9998.46 → 10001.56] I think I probably could have killed myself working on this, though.
[10002.00 → 10002.52] Oh, my God.
[10002.52 → 10004.30] Self-balancing unicycle V3?
[10004.70 → 10006.06] Get a little balance in your life?
[10006.10 → 10008.88] I used to try to put, like, a fun tagline after the title.
[10010.58 → 10011.10] You know?
[10012.64 → 10015.06] I felt a lot less stable than I look here.
[10015.26 → 10017.02] And I don't look that stable on it.
[10017.22 → 10019.28] And, like, you can tell I'm moving.
[10020.16 → 10020.66] Nine years?
[10020.72 → 10021.78] I don't remember this at all.
[10022.00 → 10023.00] That's because you didn't work on it.
[10023.02 → 10023.28] I did.
[10023.28 → 10024.84] Yeah, but still.
[10026.74 → 10034.10] This was when I would do a lot of the like, basically, this video was entirely me other than somebody, like, setting up a camera.
[10034.22 → 10034.96] Like, I wrote it.
[10035.84 → 10037.54] This is, oh, my goodness.
[10037.78 → 10038.56] That's baby.
[10039.08 → 10039.70] My boy.
[10040.32 → 10040.72] Wow.
[10041.02 → 10042.14] I know, right?
[10042.54 → 10043.96] That's kind of weird now.
[10044.16 → 10044.56] Yep.
[10044.92 → 10046.58] So that was Yvonne filming that for me.
[10046.58 → 10051.06] So I basically did most of the like, B-roll and stuff for this.
[10051.10 → 10056.26] And then we just had, we set up a quick shot in the kitchen.
[10056.44 → 10057.44] I scripted the video.
[10058.24 → 10058.76] But, yeah.
[10058.86 → 10060.44] So I learned how to use this.
[10060.60 → 10062.72] And, you know, it's not the hardest thing in the world.
[10063.14 → 10070.86] But there's a little bit of distracted operation going on when you're trying to film yourself using something that you're not necessarily a total expert at.
[10072.38 → 10072.78] Yeah.
[10072.78 → 10075.02] I don't know.
[10075.08 → 10077.64] I really liked the whole, like, e-vehicle thing.
[10077.88 → 10078.56] But it just doesn't get.
[10078.78 → 10079.20] That's a start.
[10079.36 → 10080.34] It just doesn't get views.
[10081.26 → 10084.04] Can't really justify the time spent on it.
[10084.62 → 10086.38] And I understand why.
[10086.58 → 10087.60] Like, they're niche.
[10087.70 → 10088.80] They're inherently niche.
[10088.94 → 10090.24] There's all these, like, different types.
[10090.34 → 10094.16] There's skateboards and scooters and bikes and unicycles.
[10094.68 → 10098.92] When I was in France, a very surprising amount of people in Paris used them.
[10099.82 → 10101.92] A variety of different e-vehicle things.
[10101.92 → 10103.08] Usually scooters.
[10103.26 → 10105.70] And I don't just mean the like, rental ones.
[10105.82 → 10106.40] They had their own.
[10106.54 → 10108.84] Remember when you could just, like, fly drones wherever you want?
[10109.14 → 10109.40] Yeah.
[10109.44 → 10110.04] That was pretty cool.
[10110.36 → 10111.10] That was pretty cool.
[10111.22 → 10113.50] Remember when we sucked at operating drones?
[10113.98 → 10114.20] Yeah.
[10116.44 → 10117.64] That was pretty cool, too.
[10118.50 → 10122.08] Is the backpack rain cover motorcycle wind speed approved?
[10123.88 → 10124.68] Motorcycle wind speed.
[10124.76 → 10124.94] Okay.
[10125.02 → 10125.38] Got it.
[10127.44 → 10128.34] I'm going to say no.
[10129.32 → 10130.00] I didn't even think of that.
[10130.00 → 10130.36] I'm going to say no.
[10131.72 → 10132.08] Yeah.
[10135.14 → 10136.72] It has a little...
[10136.72 → 10137.20] I know.
[10138.02 → 10138.48] But I'm just...
[10138.48 → 10139.20] But we're not...
[10139.20 → 10140.30] I'm just going to say no.
[10140.68 → 10140.94] Yeah.
[10141.88 → 10142.60] Good way to go.
[10143.00 → 10147.22] I saw somebody mounted a metal box with MCM on the back of their bike.
[10147.34 → 10149.76] And, like, all the comments were like, don't do that.
[10152.44 → 10153.10] Oh, my God.
[10153.20 → 10153.44] What?
[10153.44 → 10155.16] Oh, I didn't...
[10155.16 → 10158.56] I thought that they had a metal box that they attached to MCM to.
[10159.04 → 10160.30] No, that's very dangerous.
[10161.36 → 10163.60] If you attach it with the MCM.
[10164.46 → 10164.68] Yeah.
[10164.82 → 10165.08] Yeah.
[10165.32 → 10165.58] Nah.
[10165.72 → 10165.86] Yeah.
[10166.62 → 10168.00] It, like...
[10168.00 → 10169.18] It looked cool.
[10169.46 → 10173.24] And then you think about the ramifications of it, like, being on a road and bumps and wind
[10173.24 → 10173.78] and stuff.
[10173.84 → 10175.12] And it was like, oh, boy.
[10175.94 → 10176.94] Magnetic cable management.
[10177.12 → 10178.40] Not Mighty Car Mods, by the way.
[10179.12 → 10179.94] Ah, yes.
[10180.64 → 10180.88] Okay.
[10182.10 → 10185.48] Linus and Luke, how do you fare making friends at work while being in a position of, quote
[10185.48 → 10186.16] unquote, power?
[10187.38 → 10188.20] It's gotten harder.
[10188.70 → 10188.96] Yeah.
[10189.74 → 10191.02] Like, it's...
[10191.02 → 10192.44] Some people...
[10192.44 → 10197.18] I find that it comes down to a lot of the same things as anyone else.
[10197.30 → 10200.28] Like, the amount of time you spend working in proximity.
[10201.68 → 10204.82] The kind of enjoying successes together.
[10205.12 → 10206.22] Experiencing failures together.
[10206.36 → 10209.08] You know, a lot of the things that people just sort of bond over in general.
[10209.08 → 10213.26] But I find that, for me, like, I can kind of be friendly with anyone.
[10213.52 → 10214.24] But I only...
[10214.24 → 10215.06] I don't like anybody.
[10215.18 → 10224.56] I only have room in my social battery, you know, for a handful of closer relationships,
[10224.74 → 10225.10] you know.
[10225.26 → 10234.90] And that room is, you know, somewhere between zero and, you know, our total number of people
[10234.90 → 10236.52] on our team, which is like 100 plus.
[10236.80 → 10240.20] And it's probably closer to zero than it is to 100.
[10240.94 → 10244.08] So, you know, a lot of it is...
[10244.08 → 10245.46] A lot of it is just that proximity.
[10245.92 → 10251.10] And a lot of it is people's willingness to, like, be a friend with me.
[10251.10 → 10253.96] Because I can't dictate that.
[10254.06 → 10254.54] Like, I'm me.
[10254.64 → 10255.80] I'm just kind of me.
[10256.58 → 10262.50] And I'm kind of a lot sometimes, as you guys can probably imagine.
[10262.90 → 10262.92] Yeah.
[10263.52 → 10264.30] At least a handful.
[10264.50 → 10264.70] Yeah.
[10264.78 → 10268.30] That's regardless of being in a position of power or not a position of power.
[10268.30 → 10274.22] And for some people, you know, that's an impediment.
[10274.52 → 10279.88] For other people, just my position in the company is a problem.
[10279.98 → 10286.64] For some people, just, you know, me being a one-percenter ass bitch, you know, right?
[10286.74 → 10287.74] Could be a problem.
[10288.52 → 10289.34] Well, no, I'm serious.
[10289.84 → 10290.04] I know.
[10290.08 → 10291.16] It's just funny hearing you say that.
[10291.16 → 10293.44] Well, I try to be a realist, right?
[10293.44 → 10298.44] And some people, like, I have experienced...
[10298.44 → 10301.70] I'm not going to name any names, obviously.
[10301.98 → 10307.92] But there's people who work here now that, you know, obviously treat me extremely differently.
[10308.20 → 10313.92] That, you know, I don't think I would be able to be friends with just because of the amount of, like, ass kissing that takes place.
[10314.00 → 10316.06] Like, I personally don't like that.
[10316.10 → 10317.20] I don't like to be treated that way.
[10317.20 → 10328.06] But for some people, it's just something that they, you know, that they do naturally or that they feel is important for, you know, advancement in work or, like, whatever perception they might have.
[10328.18 → 10330.76] Like, everybody is so different.
[10331.54 → 10339.66] And, you know, so there's people that, you know, I wouldn't be able to be close to because they don't treat me like a friend.
[10339.92 → 10344.62] There's people that wouldn't be able to be close to me because they just couldn't see me as a friend.
[10344.62 → 10356.96] And then there's people that just don't give a fuck and, you know, will hang out and bro out and kind of talk about anything and just, like, be a normal human being with me.
[10357.04 → 10360.22] And I very much like hanging with those folks.
[10360.56 → 10362.50] And that's great.
[10362.82 → 10364.04] And I don't have any...
[10364.04 → 10369.18] I wouldn't say I have more difficulty with that today than I ever did.
[10369.18 → 10378.20] But I will say that the percentage of people who are able to just treat me like a normal human these days is lower as a function of how many people work here.
[10379.12 → 10379.98] What about you?
[10380.54 → 10381.34] Because it used to be...
[10381.34 → 10385.30] You used to very much just be, like, an employee, a rank and filer.
[10385.52 → 10391.22] And now you, like, run, like, three departments and I think can be a little bit intimidating.
[10391.36 → 10393.10] And you're naturally more intimidating than me.
[10393.14 → 10396.24] You're just, like, bigger and have a deeper voice and taller and stuff.
[10396.24 → 10397.06] I get that.
[10397.18 → 10399.04] I literally get that as feedback.
[10399.24 → 10400.24] It's that I'm unapproachable.
[10400.54 → 10403.92] Usually people on my own teams don't give me that feedback.
[10404.18 → 10404.36] Yeah.
[10405.08 → 10407.60] But I get that feedback externally sometimes.
[10408.14 → 10410.36] Not as much as I used to, but still sometimes.
[10411.72 → 10412.34] I don't know.
[10412.64 → 10414.24] I've questioned...
[10414.24 → 10417.20] I don't think I've talked to you or anyone else about this, to be completely honest.
[10417.20 → 10422.42] But I've questioned, like, is this a problem with me?
[10423.44 → 10425.42] Because I find that to be an issue.
[10426.22 → 10428.16] But then you and I became friends.
[10430.20 → 10433.14] When I was employee to you, boss.
[10433.96 → 10436.90] And now it's, like, I don't know.
[10437.50 → 10440.28] But then some of it's, like, the company's also just sort of changed.
[10440.66 → 10441.00] Yeah, it's different.
[10441.00 → 10441.98] Things are different now.
[10441.98 → 10449.10] We're a real company now.
[10449.34 → 10449.66] Kind of.
[10449.92 → 10450.28] Yeah.
[10450.68 → 10452.46] And that does create barriers.
[10452.66 → 10452.88] Yeah.
[10453.64 → 10454.58] To be honest.
[10454.88 → 10461.70] Because, like, when you work closely with everyone at the company, you kind of know where people's boundaries are and stuff.
[10461.70 → 10470.12] Whereas, like, if I act like myself in a group setting now, I could easily say something that is offensive to somebody.
[10470.12 → 10478.26] Like, maybe we have very different positions on, say, for example, religion or politics or whatever else.
[10478.30 → 10487.12] When you have six people, you could say something like, you know, F some politician and know with a pretty high degree of confidence that everyone's...
[10487.12 → 10488.02] What those people are going to think about.
[10488.06 → 10489.38] Yeah, everyone's kind of on the same page.
[10489.38 → 10495.74] Whereas, when you have 100 people, I guarantee you, there is no single issue that every single one of them could agree on.
[10495.96 → 10498.38] There's also politicking and there's people that, like, might...
[10499.60 → 10506.78] You don't necessarily know them well enough, and it might make sense for them to hold a certain position publicly, but they don't actually feel that way internally.
[10507.42 → 10509.40] And if you really knew that person, you might kind of know.
[10510.06 → 10515.02] But now you might only know them on a certain level that you're unsure about and Ada, Ada, Ada.
[10515.34 → 10516.78] And I don't know.
[10516.78 → 10517.84] Yeah.
[10519.38 → 10519.64] Yeah.
[10519.88 → 10521.04] Willing Spy tells lies.
[10521.16 → 10522.34] I bet they all like tech.
[10523.70 → 10524.74] Actually not necessarily.
[10524.80 → 10525.02] No.
[10525.46 → 10527.40] Actually, I, like, definitely no.
[10527.52 → 10529.22] I hate it with a burning passion.
[10529.28 → 10530.08] Well, not even just...
[10530.08 → 10531.36] That's not what we're talking about.
[10531.40 → 10532.50] I know what you mean.
[10532.70 → 10538.14] There are people that work here that, like, genuinely have no interest at all.
[10538.26 → 10538.46] Yeah.
[10538.76 → 10540.30] They got hired to do the job that they do.
[10540.44 → 10541.58] They like the job that they do.
[10541.84 → 10542.84] They do that job well.
[10542.92 → 10545.04] Or maybe they don't even like the job that they do, but they're good at it.
[10545.04 → 10545.68] But they do it well.
[10546.06 → 10547.42] Good enough, to be honest.
[10547.42 → 10549.80] That's technically all that's needed.
[10550.60 → 10552.36] I mean, we're like any other company.
[10552.58 → 10553.54] Like, think about your company.
[10553.64 → 10554.64] Think about where you work.
[10555.38 → 10559.52] Is everyone passionate about refrigerators?
[10560.16 → 10562.52] Or, like, whatever the crap it is that your company did.
[10562.58 → 10563.22] Not necessarily.
[10563.88 → 10564.16] Yeah.
[10564.62 → 10564.94] You know?
[10565.04 → 10566.96] And we like to have passionate people.
[10567.04 → 10568.12] That's something that we care about.
[10568.16 → 10569.40] And that's something that we try to foster.
[10569.40 → 10573.10] But it's not reality, right?
[10577.76 → 10578.16] More.
[10578.96 → 10579.36] Yeah.
[10579.68 → 10579.90] Sure.
[10580.44 → 10581.14] Moving on.
[10582.64 → 10585.78] Would I see much of a performance hit on a GPU?
[10586.12 → 10592.16] For example, the RTX 50 series PCI Gen 5 on a PCI Gen 4 motherboard at 4K resolution?
[10592.16 → 10593.16] Probably not.
[10593.38 → 10599.18] But we won't know for sure until we have a PCI Gen 5 graphics card to put in a slot.
[10599.50 → 10604.96] And I assume that your question is based on both the slot and the card being by 16.
[10606.46 → 10610.82] That can change once we're looking at cards that are by 8 or even by 4.
[10611.00 → 10616.56] Because if you put those in an older gen, you can run into some performance differences.
[10616.56 → 10616.96] Yeah.
[10617.00 → 10619.22] This is all something we've already talked about diving into.
[10620.82 → 10621.30] Yeah.
[10622.90 → 10623.38] Cool.
[10623.56 → 10625.16] And last one I've got for you today.
[10626.20 → 10626.66] Hello, DLL.
[10627.44 → 10630.52] I run Unpaid so I can upgrade one drive at a time.
[10630.86 → 10633.58] Just heard about Raid UV dev expansion.
[10634.12 → 10634.96] Can you talk about this?
[10635.20 → 10637.86] Does this give True NAS the same upgrade ability?
[10637.86 → 10648.92] All I can say about that for now is that there are a lot of exciting things probably maybe that have been thought of for ZFS.
[10649.78 → 10652.98] Some of which are kind of being actively worked on.
[10653.06 → 10655.02] Some of which are not being actively worked on.
[10655.12 → 10657.02] Many of which are good, cool ideas.
[10657.38 → 10660.30] And I'm very excited to see what the future holds.
[10665.30 → 10666.08] That's all I got.
[10666.64 → 10666.92] Okay.
[10666.92 → 10673.28] And I'm very excited to talk about the future WAN show you might watch.
[10674.00 → 10677.10] Because you sure as heck won't be watching any more of this one.
[10678.74 → 10679.68] See you next time.
