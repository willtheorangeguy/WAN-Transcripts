[0.96 → 5.06] What's up everyone? Welcome to the WAN show. We're going to be talking about all kinds of great stuff
[5.06 → 10.88] But of course the big headline topic is that Intel arc doesn't suck. What happened?
[10.88 → 17.88] I don't know how to make sense of this world anymore because it doesn't suck, and I'm excited, and it's not just me
[17.88 → 25.74] People are actually excited. The whole industry seems genuinely hype about building a gaming PC for the first time in flipping years
[25.74 → 32.10] So I know we already made a 16 and a half minute long video about battle mage, but I want to talk more
[32.10 → 35.00] I want to talk about battle mage some more time to yap
[35.00 → 42.96] especially some of the observations that I've made about people's comments on it and about people's viewership habits on
[43.26 → 49.14] Our other videos as a result. Don't look at the doc. He's trying to spoil. I didn't I did I opened a new tab
[49.14 → 53.78] I opened a new tab. You're hurting the laptop. We're also going to be talking about
[53.78 → 60.40] LTT and short circuit. Have they gone too far with the clickbait?
[60.40 → 61.26] Oh
[61.26 → 66.82] The world it turns out is not actually upside down. What? Unless you're in Australia
[67.34 → 74.44] In which case it's not news. Is the thumbnail like good for them? I think so. I think they can see it better. What else we got today?
[74.44 → 76.44] Oh
[76.44 → 83.32] Oh right, I'm supposed to do something now. Yeah, you're actually supposed to have the dock open and be looking at it. Yeah, but you got mad at me
[83.32 → 86.16] So I- You didn't even have it open. I opened YouTube
[88.16 → 94.32] Okay, you can buy a car on Amazon. That's weird and there's like almost no other topics
[94.32 → 103.56] Blu-rays battle mage buying a car
[103.56 → 105.56] And then hang out
[113.90 → 116.38] The show is brought to you today by MSI,
[116.92 → 123.46] Messi and Squarespace and of course our laptop partner LG our wrap partner brand and our chair partner
[123.98 → 128.36] Secret Lab. Why don't we jump right into our headline topic? Which is of course
[128.78 → 132.06] Intel arc battle mage against all odds. It's
[133.56 → 140.90] Great. Did you watch the video? Yes. Well, yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't know if you watch our review of a GPU
[140.90 → 145.94] I was up at like 8 talking to you about it and I reviewed the video. Okay, well, I don't pay attention to these things
[146.40 → 152.44] Intel! Finally watched it. Wait, what do you mean? We weren't talking about it. I know, but I- How do you not pay attention? Do you have any idea how long my week's been this week?
[152.44 → 159.86] It's been crazy. I was really surprised you were up. Yeah, well, I didn't have a choice. I was- I've been up at the beginning of days
[159.86 → 161.86] I've been up at the end of days
[161.86 → 163.86] It's been a very, very hectic week
[163.86 → 167.20] Intel finally launched their anticipated arc
[167.20 → 171.20] B580 GPU this Thursday and across the board
[171.20 → 180.20] Reviewers and the public are impressed. Yeah, it is built on the latest generation of Intel's he architecture and provides a great value with 12 gigs of VRAM
[181.20 → 187.10] Outstanding 1080p performance and even strong performance at 1440p in our testing
[187.10 → 195.10] It provided a 20% uplift over the RTX 4060 while undercutting the 4060 on price at just 249 dollars
[195.10 → 197.10] The card offers a compelling value
[197.10 → 204.10] If you can get one note I will put out there is some other reviewers, you know, we don't always test the same games
[204.10 → 207.10] We don't always test the same games in the same way. Some other reviewers have found
[207.10 → 215.10] Slightly different performance like maybe the 4060 does pretty well in like some random title like if I remember correctly Wendell said
[216.10 → 222.10] Comparatively it did pretty well in Starfield or something. I don't know. Maybe just check out his video. I mean dozens of people are playing Starfield
[222.10 → 228.10] Yeah, with that said we don't necessarily choose games for our suite based on how many people are playing them
[228.10 → 231.10] We have plenty of games in our suite that not a ton of people are playing
[231.10 → 237.10] It's benchmark well because a lot of the time you're looking for consistency, and you're looking for games that represent
[238.10 → 239.10] Something so they might represent
[239.10 → 244.10] Okay, we need to evaluate Vulcan performance or if there's a particular feature we want to look like look at like ray tracing
[244.10 → 246.10] We need a game that
[246.10 → 250.10] Supports various implementations of super sampling. We need this. We need that
[250.10 → 254.10] So a lot of the time the benchmark suite is not just down to what games people are playing
[254.10 → 256.10] But it's down to what exactly it is. We're trying to test
[256.10 → 260.10] I am sorry one I'm going to interject really quick my flight back from France when I was going to the bathroom
[260.10 → 263.10] mid-flight as I was walking
[263.10 → 270.10] Down the hallway thing. I have to go sideways. I saw somebody on a steam deck playing Starfield
[270.10 → 273.10] No way. I knew it was Starfield because they were on a loading screen
[273.10 → 278.10] When I came back from the bathroom, they were on a different loading screen
[278.10 → 281.10] I was like, yep
[281.10 → 284.10] I really wanted to stop and like talk to them like why
[284.10 → 285.10] Why?
[285.10 → 286.10] Why?
[286.10 → 289.10] But I didn't I just left them I left them be
[289.10 → 290.10] Anyway, so
[290.10 → 299.10] Intel reference cards immediately sold out most AIB partner cards which are priced around ten to twenty dollars more are also sold out
[299.10 → 301.10] Hopefully restocks will happen soon
[301.10 → 303.10] I have a short conversation
[303.10 → 305.10] I have a short conversation with someone at Intel
[305.10 → 306.10] I don't want to get them in trouble
[306.10 → 312.10] But basically I was like, please tell me you have lots of stock coming, and I'm not going to look like an idiot for saying it's 249
[312.10 → 321.10] We are expecting weekly replenishments on the reference card and working with partners to offer steady availability
[321.10 → 329.10] I said, okay, you have to control the channel tell the boys come on there will be money to be made later
[329.10 → 331.10] Don't f**k this up. We need momentum
[331.10 → 332.10] Seriously
[332.10 → 334.10] I'm passing that along verbatim
[334.10 → 335.10] Hell yeah
[335.10 → 336.10] I don't know that they have any power
[336.10 → 338.10] I don't know that they even know anything
[338.10 → 339.10] This is the janitor
[339.10 → 342.10] I was talking to the janitor at Intel's graphics division
[342.10 → 344.10] That's the only person I know there
[344.10 → 347.10] I'm not important enough to have any like, you know, high up contacts or anything like that
[347.10 → 348.10] Sure
[348.10 → 351.10] But what I can say is that I have
[351.10 → 352.10] Janitor's pretty cool guy
[352.10 → 355.10] I have said what I can to the janitor at Intel
[355.10 → 356.10] Works hard
[356.10 → 357.10] About
[357.10 → 358.10] Hey
[358.10 → 360.10] Don't get greedy here
[360.10 → 362.10] You need to buy some market share
[362.10 → 364.10] Your partners need some market share
[364.10 → 365.10] Sparkle
[365.10 → 368.10] Is not a relevant GPU maker
[368.10 → 371.10] There's there's there's GPU partners that are running away from Nvidia
[371.10 → 373.10] If you're nice to them right now like
[373.10 → 377.10] Be a valid option
[377.10 → 379.10] But with that said I mean
[379.10 → 382.10] I'm telling Intel don't be that nice
[382.10 → 383.10] Yet
[383.10 → 384.10] Sure
[384.10 → 386.10] There will be time to make an extra 10 bucks
[386.10 → 387.10] It will come
[387.10 → 388.10] Oh, I see what you mean
[388.10 → 389.10] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[389.10 → 390.10] I mean yeah, yeah
[390.10 → 391.10] But you got to control the channel
[391.10 → 392.10] Don't be nice to them by hosing
[392.10 → 393.10] Not now
[393.10 → 394.10] The buyers
[394.10 → 395.10] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[395.10 → 396.10] Not now
[396.10 → 399.10] Now is not the time to look at the market out there and go
[399.10 → 403.10] Oh, this card is priced attractively
[403.10 → 408.10] We should f*** up the pricing and price it less attractively
[408.10 → 409.10] Just win
[409.10 → 410.10] Just win
[410.10 → 413.10] Win the hearts and minds of gamers
[413.10 → 415.10] It's really important right now
[415.10 → 418.10] Now you've got X amount of months until 50 60 comes out
[418.10 → 420.10] We don't know how long genuinely
[420.10 → 425.10] That card will come out and then that's when you know we'll see how you're doing
[425.10 → 436.10] Now it is worth noting EU viewers have pointed out that the card is being sold at the same price as the RX 7700 XT in Europe which is a 400 US dollar card
[436.10 → 439.10] The B580 it's good, but it ain't that good
[439.10 → 445.10] That's another thing that Intel and their partners need to get figured out is global competitiveness for this thing needs to be good
[445.10 → 451.10] With that said given they can't keep the bloody thing in stock I can see how it's a lower priority but guys
[451.10 → 456.10] Make as many as you can please
[456.10 → 459.10] This is in my notes
[459.10 → 462.10] Pat Gelsinger's fasting and praying paid off
[462.10 → 463.10] Yeah I just opened this up
[464.10 → 468.10] Every Thursday I do a 24-hour prayer and fasting day
[468.10 → 470.10] This week I'd invite you to join me in praying for
[470.10 → 472.10] What is this? What am I even looking at right now?
[472.10 → 473.10] Hold on a second
[473.10 → 474.10] I don't really know
[474.10 → 477.10] We have 100,000 Intel employees as they navigate this difficult period
[477.10 → 482.10] Intel and its team is of seminal importance to the future of the industry and the US
[482.10 → 488.10] This is actually incredibly important, and I do want to talk about this later
[488.10 → 493.10] And I have to say that I just want to shout out that I hadn't read this tweet yet
[493.10 → 497.10] But I think some of Pat's tweets have been hilarious
[497.10 → 498.10] I haven't looked at it
[498.10 → 503.10] And I love that he's just out there tweeting about the company immediately after leaving
[503.10 → 506.10] Dude I just I want him back already
[506.10 → 509.10] It is like can they just hire can they just say look we were wrong
[509.10 → 510.10] Oh wait and Sam
[510.10 → 511.10] And Sam
[511.10 → 512.10] Maybe come back
[512.10 → 513.10] Can they Sam Altman this?
[513.10 → 514.10] Yeah
[514.10 → 517.10] And just be like bro I'm sorry
[517.10 → 520.10] Can we just have you back because we didn't get it
[520.10 → 526.10] This is like the first thing that has come out that has actually been like Pat's vision start to finish
[526.10 → 528.10] Actually no he came in after
[528.10 → 529.10] A little bit
[529.10 → 530.10] He came in a little bit after
[530.10 → 540.10] But like okay so that's not the first thing the point is that we are only now starting to see things that he actually really had a hand in
[540.10 → 543.10] I mean it has the same problem as politics where you'll come in as the
[543.10 → 544.10] Yeah
[544.10 → 546.10] You'll come in you'll set a bunch of things in motion
[546.10 → 550.10] Oh we didn't make enough quarterly profit see you later buddy
[550.10 → 555.10] And then the next guy or gal comes in, and it's like oh great job all these products are doing so great
[555.10 → 556.10] Let's count beans
[556.10 → 561.10] I'm inheriting this garbage heap time to work on that for like fixing that for three years
[561.10 → 565.10] Then I get one year maybe to like to reap some of the benefits of what I did then I'm out probably
[566.10 → 567.10] Okay
[568.10 → 569.10] I'm just
[569.10 → 571.10] Anyway I'm jazzed
[571.10 → 577.10] Okay what else we got to talk about besides the question of value the other big question for Ark was game compatibility
[577.10 → 583.10] While our testing was relatively smooth except for cyberpunk 2077 ultra ray tracing which crashed
[584.10 → 588.10] Problems are still present as many reviewers did encounter issues in a variety of titles
[588.10 → 591.10] Apparently star field is still a problem game for Ark GPUs
[591.10 → 594.10] I think that's one of the reasons why the 4060 did comparatively well
[594.10 → 595.10] That makes sense
[595.10 → 598.10] So it might be good to wait a bit let the early adopters help Intel sort out the bugs
[598.10 → 606.10] But also looking at how dedicated Intel has been to improving their drivers on the first generation Ark Alchemist card
[606.10 → 608.10] Oh yeah that was actually crazy
[608.10 → 611.10] You should buy a product for what it is right now
[611.10 → 613.10] You should not buy a promise etc etc etc
[613.10 → 620.10] However I do believe that promises can have varying levels of credibility
[620.10 → 622.10] And I think that if Intel were to say
[622.10 → 628.10] We are very dedicated to improving the drivers of our GPUs
[628.10 → 632.10] I would say that that is a credible promise
[632.10 → 634.10] And you know it doesn't always work
[634.10 → 635.10] Starfield isn't new
[635.10 → 640.10] And our GPUs like if I recall he didn't even work in Starfield when it first launched
[640.10 → 641.10] Wasn't that a thing?
[641.10 → 642.10] I don't remember
[642.10 → 643.10] I don't remember it was bad whatever it was bad
[643.10 → 645.10] And it's still not good
[645.10 → 648.10] So like they're not completely acing everything
[648.10 → 650.10] Again don't buy things on future promises
[650.10 → 655.10] But if you know effectively like what games you and your crew play
[655.10 → 660.10] And you can look at how those perform based on some reviewer that's probably checked it out
[660.10 → 662.10] Or some number somewhere on the internet that you can find
[662.10 → 666.10] You might be able to say hey this works for all the games that I play right now
[666.10 → 669.10] So maybe that works for me
[669.10 → 670.10] And then cool
[670.10 → 671.10] Yeah
[671.10 → 678.10] Now I want to come into sort of transition topic from that
[678.10 → 690.10] And this is that my job is so much easier when there are good products, and they're a great value
[690.10 → 696.10] Like do you have any idea what it felt like to wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy
[696.10 → 703.10] Sorry, to wake up in the morning actually that has not aged well
[703.10 → 704.10] No it really hasn't
[704.10 → 705.10] I was just going for the Kesha lyric
[705.10 → 706.10] Okay
[706.10 → 707.10] Yeah, that
[707.10 → 708.10] Wow
[708.10 → 709.10] Yep
[709.10 → 710.10] Shout out Kesha
[710.10 → 712.10] No I don't by the way
[712.10 → 714.10] And neither do you
[714.10 → 716.10] I forgot that
[716.10 → 718.10] I forgot that P. Diddy is also Puff Daddy
[718.10 → 720.10] You caught it yourself this time, very good job
[720.10 → 722.10] Yeah I caught myself
[722.10 → 724.10] We're improving you know it happens over time
[724.10 → 725.10] We work on it
[725.10 → 726.10] We work on things
[726.10 → 727.10] Has she changed the lyrics?
[727.10 → 729.10] We improve
[729.10 → 733.10] We learn cultural references
[733.10 → 734.10] Hold on
[734.10 → 735.10] Hard P
[736.10 → 742.10] Sorry Dot Justin said that
[742.10 → 743.10] That got me
[743.10 → 745.10] Apparently the lyrics have changed
[745.10 → 751.10] Kesha has announced, this is from August, that she will re-record her hit song Tick Toque
[751.10 → 757.10] Changing it from wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy to wake up in the morning feeling
[758.10 → 759.10] F*** P. Diddy
[760.10 → 761.10] So that's something
[761.10 → 762.10] Alright
[762.10 → 764.10] Yeah, she's highly relevant these days
[764.10 → 765.10] Yeah
[765.10 → 766.10] Anywho, the point is
[766.10 → 767.10] Is she?
[767.10 → 768.10] Where am I going with this?
[768.10 → 769.10] No
[769.10 → 770.10] Oh, okay
[771.10 → 775.10] Yeah, her career by my understanding is sort of a sad story actually
[775.10 → 776.10] Oh
[776.10 → 777.10] Yeah, I mean
[777.10 → 778.10] I don't
[778.10 → 779.10] Anyway
[779.10 → 780.10] Okay
[780.10 → 781.10] The point is
[781.10 → 782.10] The point is
[782.10 → 783.10] Um
[785.10 → 786.10] I woke up in the morning
[787.10 → 789.10] With a 99% like ratio on a video
[790.10 → 791.10] Feeling like a respectable human
[791.10 → 792.10] Yeah
[792.10 → 793.10] Feeling like a feeling like
[794.10 → 795.10] Anyway
[795.10 → 796.10] Um
[796.10 → 798.10] We didn't need an elaborate hook
[799.10 → 800.10] You know
[800.10 → 801.10] Oh yeah
[801.10 → 802.10] Or a weird thumbnail
[802.10 → 803.10] Or
[803.10 → 804.10] Or like a
[805.10 → 806.10] It felt good to watch
[806.10 → 807.10] A three-day shoot
[808.10 → 809.10] Or you know
[809.10 → 810.10] It just
[810.10 → 811.10] All we had to do
[811.10 → 812.10] Was execute
[813.10 → 814.10] We got our briefings
[815.10 → 816.10] The labs team did a great job
[817.10 → 818.10] The writing team did a great job
[819.10 → 820.10] The production team did a great job
[820.10 → 821.10] The editing team did a great job
[821.10 → 822.10] The business team did a great job
[822.10 → 824.10] We sold our sponsors
[824.10 → 825.10] Spots
[826.10 → 827.10] You have the swipe
[829.10 → 830.10] It was like a breath of fresh air
[830.10 → 831.10] Like this machine
[831.10 → 832.10] Felt good
[832.10 → 833.10] This machine is
[834.10 → 835.10] Is built
[835.10 → 836.10] To survive anything
[837.10 → 838.10] But boy
[838.10 → 839.10] Does it ever run better
[840.10 → 841.10] When tech companies
[842.10 → 843.10] Make a product
[843.10 → 844.10] That anyone
[844.10 → 845.10] F***ING cares about
[845.10 → 846.10] And wants to put in their
[847.10 → 848.10] F***ING computer
[849.10 → 850.10] When you take out the like
[851.10 → 852.10] Discarded kitchen grease
[852.10 → 853.10] And you put in some actual gas
[853.10 → 854.10] And it's just like
[854.10 → 855.10] Oh wow
[855.10 → 856.10] Wow
[856.10 → 857.10] It runs nice
[857.10 → 858.10] Now we're cooking
[859.10 → 860.10] Like dude
[860.10 → 861.10] It is
[861.10 → 862.10] It takes me back
[862.10 → 863.10] To years ago
[863.10 → 864.10] Oh yeah
[864.10 → 866.10] Like it is such a stark contrast
[866.10 → 867.10] When we were
[867.10 → 868.10] When I was sitting in script review
[869.10 → 870.10] Okay, and I was working on the intro
[870.10 → 871.10] With the writer for that video
[872.10 → 873.10] And we were going through it
[873.10 → 874.10] And I was like
[874.10 → 875.10] No, no really
[875.10 → 876.10] When was the last time
[877.10 → 879.10] There was a $250 GPU
[879.10 → 882.10] That anyone actually wanted to buy
[882.10 → 883.10] Oh seriously
[883.10 → 884.10] Not that they were like
[885.10 → 886.10] Forced to buy
[886.10 → 887.10] Because there wasn't
[887.10 → 888.10] A valid option
[889.10 → 890.10] Whatsoever
[890.10 → 891.10] Like
[891.10 → 892.10] I think this is why
[892.10 → 893.10] A few different creators
[893.10 → 894.10] All included like 1060s and stuff
[894.10 → 895.10] In their reviews
[896.10 → 897.10] Like
[897.10 → 898.10] Because
[898.10 → 899.10] That was the last time
[899.10 → 900.10] Yeah
[900.10 → 901.10] It's been
[901.10 → 902.10] Five years
[902.10 → 903.10] Yeah
[903.10 → 904.10] And like
[904.10 → 905.10] I had this line
[905.10 → 906.10] That I
[906.10 → 907.10] Is this the like mark
[907.10 → 909.10] That like the COVID era is over
[909.10 → 910.10] Maybe
[910.10 → 911.10] Like finally through it
[911.10 → 912.10] Dude I had this line
[912.10 → 913.10] I had this line
[913.10 → 914.10] I put in the intro
[914.10 → 915.10] That I was like
[916.10 → 917.10] Almost half of the time
[917.10 → 918.10] Back to normal
[918.10 → 920.10] That Linus Media Group Inc.
[920.10 → 921.10] Has existed
[922.10 → 923.10] Oh
[923.10 → 924.10] That's rough
[924.10 → 925.10] There hasn't been
[926.10 → 927.10] A budget
[927.10 → 928.10] Like a value
[928.10 → 929.10] GPU launch
[929.10 → 930.10] Worth writing about
[930.10 → 933.10] There's been nothing
[934.10 → 935.10] 1650 was like
[936.10 → 937.10] Kind of okay
[937.10 → 938.10] But they cut it down
[938.10 → 939.10] It sucked
[940.10 → 941.10] We knew we weren't getting
[941.10 → 943.10] The value that we could have gotten
[945.10 → 946.10] Like
[946.10 → 947.10] Dude
[947.10 → 948.10] Like we've gotten
[949.10 → 950.10] We've gotten like
[950.10 → 951.10] How many products
[951.10 → 952.10] In five years
[952.10 → 953.10] Have we gotten
[953.10 → 954.10] That have blown us away
[954.10 → 955.10] With their value
[955.10 → 956.10] Like sure
[956.10 → 957.10] Okay
[957.10 → 958.10] Oculus Quest series
[958.10 → 959.10] You could make that argument
[959.10 → 961.10] But what did you give up for it?
[961.10 → 962.10] Right?
[962.10 → 963.10] Like it wasn't just
[963.10 → 965.10] Intel's not asking for anything in return
[965.10 → 966.10] Here's a GPU
[966.10 → 968.10] Give me $250
[968.10 → 969.10] That's it
[969.10 → 971.10] We don't take your personal data
[972.10 → 973.10] Just
[973.10 → 974.10] Play video games
[975.10 → 976.10] F*** yeah
[976.10 → 977.10] You know?
[977.10 → 978.10] That's what the review felt like
[978.10 → 980.10] I think my favourite part was when you
[980.10 → 981.10] You ran out of like
[981.10 → 982.10] Positive things to say
[982.10 → 983.10] So you're just like
[983.10 → 984.10] Blah blah blah blah
[984.10 → 985.10] Or whatever
[985.10 → 986.10] I don't remember exactly what you did
[986.10 → 987.10] But it was great
[987.10 → 988.10] I was
[988.10 → 989.10] I hadn't read the script
[989.10 → 990.10] So when I was watching it
[990.10 → 991.10] I was getting to that point
[991.10 → 992.10] I was genuinely like
[992.10 → 993.10] I wonder what he's going to keep saying
[993.10 → 995.10] Cause like I know what these graphs are
[995.10 → 996.10] And then
[996.10 → 997.10] Yeah you were just like
[997.10 → 998.10] Blah blah blah
[999.10 → 1000.10] I thought it was awesome
[1000.10 → 1001.10] Well it's like I
[1001.10 → 1002.10] You know I just
[1003.10 → 1005.10] I want that to be the case
[1005.10 → 1006.10] Like it's
[1006.10 → 1007.10] Do you know how unrun it is
[1007.10 → 1008.10] Yeah
[1008.10 → 1009.10] To whine about things
[1009.10 → 1011.10] And you know how unrun it is
[1012.10 → 1013.10] To feel like
[1013.10 → 1015.10] To feel like a shot messenger sometimes
[1015.10 → 1016.10] Oh yeah
[1016.10 → 1018.10] Like I remember the amount of flack
[1018.10 → 1019.10] That we took
[1019.10 → 1020.10] In the middle of like
[1020.10 → 1021.10] 40 series
[1021.10 → 1022.10] When we basically came out
[1022.10 → 1023.10] With a review of some card
[1023.10 → 1024.10] I forget what it was
[1024.10 → 1025.10] And we were like
[1025.10 → 1026.10] Well
[1026.10 → 1028.10] Realistically in the current landscape
[1029.10 → 1030.10] This is a deal
[1031.10 → 1032.10] I don't like it
[1032.10 → 1033.10] But it is
[1033.10 → 1034.10] And we got
[1034.10 → 1035.10] Pitchforked over it
[1035.10 → 1036.10] And the number of people
[1036.10 → 1037.10] That were messaging me
[1037.10 → 1038.10] DMing me
[1038.10 → 1039.10] Leaving comments
[1039.10 → 1040.10] And they're like
[1040.10 → 1041.10] Linus
[1041.10 → 1042.10] You need to hold these companies
[1042.10 → 1043.10] Accountable
[1043.10 → 1044.10] You need to put pressure on them
[1044.10 → 1045.10] To lower the price
[1045.10 → 1046.10] It's like
[1046.10 → 1048.10] I don't have any power
[1048.10 → 1050.10] I don't have that power
[1050.10 → 1051.10] You think
[1051.10 → 1052.10] You think Jensen Wong
[1052.10 → 1053.10] Is watching my video
[1053.10 → 1054.10] Going
[1054.10 → 1055.10] Hmm yes Linus
[1055.10 → 1056.10] How should we price our GPU
[1056.10 → 1057.10] He doesn't care
[1057.10 → 1058.10] What I think
[1058.10 → 1059.10] We have to all
[1059.10 → 1060.10] Try to work on it
[1060.10 → 1061.10] But it almost doesn't matter
[1061.10 → 1062.10] When they're just selling it
[1062.10 → 1063.10] All the computer anyway
[1063.10 → 1064.10] It doesn't matter at all
[1064.10 → 1065.10] Because at the end of the day
[1065.10 → 1067.10] I can whine about microtransactions
[1067.10 → 1068.10] I can whine about
[1068.10 → 1069.10] Overpriced GPUs
[1069.10 → 1070.10] But wouldn't like 80% of people buy them
[1070.10 → 1072.10] I can whine about a lack of innovation
[1072.10 → 1073.10] In the tech industry
[1073.10 → 1074.10] I can whine about all these things
[1074.10 → 1075.10] It doesn't matter
[1075.10 → 1076.10] As long as people buy them
[1076.10 → 1078.10] Money talks
[1079.10 → 1080.10] And at the end of the day
[1080.10 → 1081.10] I'm not buying GPUs
[1082.10 → 1084.10] So I can offer my opinion
[1084.10 → 1086.10] And they might take it under advisement
[1086.10 → 1087.10] But that's it
[1087.10 → 1088.10] And so
[1088.10 → 1090.10] I'm sitting here going like
[1090.10 → 1091.10] On the one hand
[1091.10 → 1094.10] Yeah I hate getting shot as a messenger
[1094.10 → 1095.10] But on the other hand
[1095.10 → 1097.10] Boy was it ever nice
[1097.10 → 1099.10] To just upload a video
[1099.10 → 1101.10] With some really great news
[1101.10 → 1102.10] And have people be like
[1102.10 → 1103.10] Wow good job
[1105.10 → 1106.10] But that's the reason
[1106.10 → 1107.10] I'm bringing it up
[1107.10 → 1108.10] Is like yeah I think our team
[1108.10 → 1109.10] Did an excellent job
[1109.10 → 1110.10] Of executing on that video
[1111.10 → 1112.10] But on the other hand
[1112.10 → 1113.10] I want to make sure
[1113.10 → 1115.10] That we are giving the credit
[1115.10 → 1116.10] To where it is due
[1116.10 → 1118.10] Which is the great work
[1118.10 → 1120.10] That Intel's software team has done
[1120.10 → 1122.10] That Intel's engineering team has done
[1122.10 → 1124.10] And that Intel's management
[1124.10 → 1126.10] However not present
[1126.10 → 1128.10] They may or may not be now
[1128.10 → 1129.10] Maybe other than the ones
[1129.10 → 1131.10] Involving the removal of
[1131.10 → 1132.10] Yeah
[1132.10 → 1133.10] How someone special
[1133.10 → 1134.10] How good the job
[1134.10 → 1135.10] The people who have supported
[1135.10 → 1136.10] This project
[1136.10 → 1137.10] For this long
[1137.10 → 1138.10] Yeah there we go
[1138.10 → 1139.10] Now it's clear
[1139.10 → 1141.10] That this discrete desktop GPU
[1141.10 → 1143.10] Would have been killed ages ago
[1143.10 → 1144.10] If that was the whole picture
[1144.10 → 1146.10] Intel needs a GPU product
[1146.10 → 1147.10] For the data centre
[1147.10 → 1150.10] They need a compelling GPU architecture
[1150.10 → 1153.10] For their mobile devices
[1153.10 → 1155.10] And that's what Battle mage gave them
[1155.10 → 1156.10] Because it doesn't
[1156.10 → 1157.10] Sure sweet
[1157.10 → 1158.10] It made Lunar Lake
[1158.10 → 1160.10] Their latest mobile chips
[1160.10 → 1161.10] It made Lunar Lake
[1161.10 → 1162.10] More competitive as well
[1162.10 → 1163.10] They finally
[1163.10 → 1164.10] And that's one of the reasons
[1164.10 → 1165.10] That hopefully
[1166.10 → 1167.10] Knock on wood
[1167.10 → 1168.10] We are going to continue
[1168.10 → 1170.10] To see new architectures
[1171.10 → 1172.10] Going forward
[1172.10 → 1173.10] Celestial is apparently baked
[1174.10 → 1177.10] So they're working on
[1178.10 → 1179.10] Like the hardware level stuff now
[1179.10 → 1180.10] But apparently the design
[1180.10 → 1181.10] Is
[1181.10 → 1182.10] Is
[1182.10 → 1183.10] Is
[1183.10 → 1184.10] Is
[1184.10 → 1185.10] I think baked
[1185.10 → 1187.10] Was the word that was used
[1187.10 → 1188.10] But
[1188.10 → 1189.10] There was a little bit more nuance
[1189.10 → 1190.10] Hold on
[1191.10 → 1192.10] Celestial
[1192.10 → 1193.10] Baked
[1193.10 → 1194.10] Intel
[1194.10 → 1195.10] Hold on
[1195.10 → 1196.10] I'm trying to find the quote
[1196.10 → 1197.10] Tom Peterson confirms
[1197.10 → 1198.10] That
[1198.10 → 1199.10] Druid
[1199.10 → 1200.10] Is already in the works
[1200.10 → 1201.10] And that the hardware level
[1201.10 → 1202.10] Groundwork for Celestial
[1202.10 → 1203.10] Which includes architectural layouts
[1203.10 → 1204.10] And prototypes
[1204.10 → 1205.10] Is
[1206.10 → 1207.10] Done
[1207.10 → 1208.10] Speaking of which
[1208.10 → 1209.10] Wow
[1209.10 → 1210.10] Mr. Tom Peterson
[1210.10 → 1211.10] So exciting
[1211.10 → 1212.10] Yes
[1212.10 → 1213.10] Fantastic job of communication around this launch
[1214.10 → 1215.10] I didn't feel
[1215.10 → 1217.10] Like there's been so many times
[1217.10 → 1218.10] Throughout the years
[1218.10 → 1219.10] Like back when I used to do review stuff
[1219.10 → 1220.10] And even more recently
[1221.10 → 1223.10] Where you feel like you're
[1223.10 → 1224.10] You know
[1224.10 → 1225.10] Getting the wool pulled over your eyes
[1225.10 → 1227.10] Including in the past
[1227.10 → 1228.10] Just to you know
[1228.10 → 1229.10] Sorry guys
[1229.10 → 1230.10] But give you a little bit of a rip
[1230.10 → 1231.10] From Intel
[1231.10 → 1232.10] Yep
[1232.10 → 1233.10] This time
[1233.10 → 1234.10] No
[1234.10 → 1235.10] He showed us charts
[1235.10 → 1236.10] Where they lost
[1236.10 → 1238.10] Because
[1238.10 → 1239.10] They were like
[1239.10 → 1240.10] Here's a huge amount of games
[1240.10 → 1241.10] This is how it did
[1241.10 → 1242.10] Sometimes it did poorly
[1242.10 → 1243.10] Usually it did great
[1243.10 → 1244.10] Cool
[1244.10 → 1245.10] Like it felt like I was getting
[1245.10 → 1246.10] Actual information
[1246.10 → 1247.10] Not I
[1247.10 → 1249.10] Like we were getting actual information
[1249.10 → 1250.10] Leading up to a launch
[1250.10 → 1251.10] That helped us
[1251.10 → 1253.10] Understand
[1253.10 → 1254.10] What should be happening
[1254.10 → 1255.10] During the launch
[1255.10 → 1256.10] At all
[1256.10 → 1257.10] Like it was very open
[1257.10 → 1258.10] Transparent
[1258.10 → 1259.10] Which is useful
[1259.10 → 1260.10] Which is really helpful for us
[1260.10 → 1261.10] Because at the end of the day
[1261.10 → 1262.10] That's awesome
[1262.10 → 1263.10] We're going to figure it out anyway
[1263.10 → 1264.10] Yeah
[1264.10 → 1265.10] If your product sucks
[1265.10 → 1266.10] So like
[1266.10 → 1267.10] So you might as well help us
[1267.10 → 1268.10] And I think Tap gets that
[1268.10 → 1269.10] He's been around forever
[1269.10 → 1270.10] Yep
[1270.10 → 1271.10] And it's just
[1271.10 → 1272.10] It's very
[1272.10 → 1273.10] It's very helpful
[1273.10 → 1275.10] I think having his influence on things
[1275.10 → 1276.10] Yeah because it's not like
[1276.10 → 1277.10] We don't want to tell
[1277.10 → 1279.10] The positive side of the story as well
[1279.10 → 1280.10] Yeah we loved doing this
[1280.10 → 1281.10] We wanted
[1281.10 → 1282.10] This was great
[1282.10 → 1283.10] We want to tell
[1283.10 → 1284.10] The whole story
[1284.10 → 1286.10] And the more information you give us
[1286.10 → 1287.10] The less time we spend
[1287.10 → 1288.10] Just dicking around
[1288.10 → 1289.10] Dicking around
[1289.10 → 1291.10] Trying to find what you're trying to hide from us
[1291.10 → 1292.10] Yeah
[1292.10 → 1294.10] And the more time we can spend working on
[1294.10 → 1296.10] Crafting a message that helps communicate the product
[1296.10 → 1297.10] Because at the end of the day
[1297.10 → 1298.10] That's what we want people to know
[1298.10 → 1300.10] We want them to know what's bad about it
[1300.10 → 1301.10] What's mid about it
[1301.10 → 1302.10] What's good about it
[1302.10 → 1304.10] Which ultimately should be what you want people to know
[1304.10 → 1306.10] That's how marketing is supposed to work
[1306.10 → 1307.10] I genuinely like
[1307.10 → 1309.10] You're supposed to come to us with the marketing materials
[1309.10 → 1311.10] We're supposed to read it
[1311.10 → 1312.10] Interpret it
[1312.10 → 1313.10] Test it
[1313.10 → 1314.10] And then present that
[1314.10 → 1316.10] Alongside our own findings to the audience
[1316.10 → 1317.10] To the audience
[1317.10 → 1318.10] Yeah
[1318.10 → 1319.10] And then they can make an informed decision
[1319.10 → 1321.10] It's about informed decision-making
[1321.10 → 1323.10] And so often it feels like a battle
[1323.10 → 1324.10] And
[1326.10 → 1327.10] This time it felt like
[1328.10 → 1330.10] You know we were on the same side almost
[1330.10 → 1334.10] Like it felt like they were genuinely trying to help us make good content
[1335.10 → 1336.10] Which
[1337.10 → 1339.10] Sounds like that should be pretty normal
[1339.10 → 1341.10] But it's like super not
[1341.10 → 1342.10] So anyway
[1342.10 → 1344.10] I just wanted to shout that out because I appreciate it
[1344.10 → 1345.10] There's a couple other
[1345.10 → 1348.10] There's a couple other kind of comments on this topic here
[1349.10 → 1350.10] This is amazing
[1350.10 → 1353.10] This is a direct quote from Adam Sondergaard from the writing team
[1353.10 → 1360.10] This is the first full-blown positive CPU or GPU review that I've written in my three years here
[1361.10 → 1362.10] At LTT
[1362.10 → 1363.10] Did a great job of it
[1363.10 → 1364.10] Yeah, he did a great job
[1364.10 → 1365.10] I mean like
[1365.10 → 1366.10] Considering you've only written negative ones
[1366.10 → 1367.10] He's only ever worked with lemons
[1367.10 → 1368.10] He's only ever worked with lemons
[1368.10 → 1369.10] He did a great job of writing a positive one
[1369.10 → 1371.10] He's only ever worked with lemons
[1371.10 → 1372.10] You give this man some lemonade
[1373.10 → 1374.10] He's going to put that powder in the glass
[1375.10 → 1376.10] He's going to stir it up
[1377.10 → 1378.10] Ah
[1379.10 → 1380.10] Delicious right?
[1380.10 → 1381.10] Yeah
[1381.10 → 1382.10] But yeah after years of creeping price points
[1383.10 → 1385.10] Low part availability and cool but expensive tech
[1385.10 → 1390.10] I feel like it has broadly deflated interest in the hobby
[1390.10 → 1391.10] Oh yeah
[1391.10 → 1393.10] Which makes our job as content creators so hard
[1394.10 → 1399.10] Do you guys think we want to reach for like complex video concepts
[1400.10 → 1402.10] And like you think we want to react to stuff on Reddit?
[1402.10 → 1403.10] No
[1403.10 → 1404.10] No
[1404.10 → 1405.10] We'd love to be
[1405.10 → 1409.10] We'd love to be making videos about cool new GPUs and CPUs and RAM and cases
[1410.10 → 1411.10] Cool stuff
[1411.10 → 1412.10] That's what we want
[1412.10 → 1419.10] I mean people wonder why our content has diverged from a strict focus on PC hardware and building PC
[1420.10 → 1423.10] Building PCs is because there's nothing to make videos about and no one cares
[1424.10 → 1425.10] Yeah
[1425.10 → 1428.10] Man we've uploaded videos on like how to build a PC recently that have just bombed
[1428.10 → 1433.10] Because people don't care they don't want to do it but here's what happened immediately
[1434.10 → 1435.10] Oh did those types of videos crank up?
[1435.10 → 1438.10] Did you see the screenshot that I sent to the topic chat?
[1438.10 → 1439.10] That's so cool it's so good for the culture
[1439.10 → 1441.10] Okay watch this
[1441.10 → 1443.10] Did you see the screenshot I sent to the approval chat?
[1443.10 → 1444.10] No
[1444.10 → 1445.10] Okay watch this
[1445.10 → 1447.10] Okay so this right here is a
[1447.10 → 1450.10] This right here is a not knowing how to use an iPhone
[1450.10 → 1452.10] Hold on where's the thing the approval chat
[1452.10 → 1454.10] Where's my screenshots?
[1454.10 → 1455.10] Here they are
[1455.10 → 1456.10] I like your watch back there
[1456.10 → 1458.10] Oh yeah my little unicorn
[1458.10 → 1460.10] Okay here we go here we go here we go
[1460.10 → 1461.10] Looks like the labs concept logo
[1461.10 → 1463.10] So here's the ARC B580
[1463.10 → 1464.10] Okay, so this is the next day
[1464.10 → 1465.10] And so we got obviously some recent videos
[1465.10 → 1467.10] Upgrading my big brother's PC
[1467.10 → 1469.10] Rented an Airbnb to look for hidden cameras
[1469.10 → 1470.10] And you know some stuff
[1470.10 → 1471.10] Anyway the point is
[1472.10 → 1473.10] Here's as we go down the list
[1474.10 → 1475.10] We've got how to build a PC
[1475.10 → 1477.10] The last guide you'll ever need
[1477.10 → 1478.10] Some other crap
[1478.10 → 1479.10] How to build a PC
[1479.10 → 1480.10] The other one
[1480.10 → 1481.10] The older one
[1481.10 → 1482.10] The last guide you'll ever need
[1482.10 → 1483.10] Immediately
[1483.10 → 1484.10] Immediately
[1484.10 → 1486.10] It's almost like
[1486.10 → 1489.10] Entry level computers are good for once in years
[1489.10 → 1491.10] It's almost like it's a mistake
[1492.10 → 1496.10] To turn your entire product stack purely transactional
[1496.10 → 1497.10] Price everything
[1497.10 → 1498.10] Feature everything
[1499.10 → 1500.10] For what the market will bear
[1500.10 → 1506.10] It's almost like that's going to kill the enthusiasm for your products in the long term
[1506.10 → 1510.10] It's almost like when someone comes in with something that's legitimately exciting
[1511.10 → 1515.10] Instead of just seeing everything in terms of total addressable market
[1515.10 → 1518.10] And optimized profit to expense ratio
[1519.10 → 1520.10] Blah blah blah blah blah
[1520.10 → 1523.10] It's almost like you can create new customers
[1523.10 → 1525.10] By making something that's exciting
[1525.10 → 1526.10] And gets people talking
[1527.10 → 1528.10] Gets people looking into it
[1528.10 → 1531.10] Gets people exploring and wanting to learn
[1531.10 → 1533.10] Thank you very much Intel
[1533.10 → 1538.10] And this is a really, really important thing that I want to bring up
[1538.10 → 1540.10] Guys
[1541.10 → 1542.10] Intel Arc
[1542.10 → 1545.10] Is going to force the incumbents to react
[1546.10 → 1549.10] NVIDIA and AMD are very likely
[1550.10 → 1554.10] To bring their cards down to a price that is competitive with Arc
[1555.10 → 1556.10] Don't forget
[1556.10 → 1560.10] When you're recommending a $250 GPU to a friend
[1560.10 → 1561.10] Or building a new machine
[1562.10 → 1563.10] Don't forget
[1563.10 → 1564.10] Who made the price point happen
[1567.10 → 1569.10] We've talked about this so many times
[1570.10 → 1571.10] In my opinion there's a value to that
[1571.10 → 1572.10] People root for AMD
[1573.10 → 1574.10] Yeah
[1574.10 → 1575.10] So that their NVIDIA card can be cheaper
[1576.10 → 1577.10] Yeah
[1577.10 → 1578.10] But now
[1578.10 → 1579.10] Arc is not just like
[1580.10 → 1583.10] A crappy option that we hope will become a good option someday
[1583.10 → 1584.10] It's a legitimately good option
[1585.10 → 1586.10] It's a solid option right now
[1586.10 → 1587.10] It's a solid option
[1587.10 → 1590.10] If I was building a computer for a friend or something in this price point
[1590.10 → 1591.10] I would probably throw this GPU in
[1592.10 → 1594.10] I might check what games they play
[1594.10 → 1595.10] Yeah
[1595.10 → 1596.10] Make sure it's going to run well
[1596.10 → 1597.10] Yep
[1597.10 → 1598.10] But you know
[1598.10 → 1599.10] You should do that anyway
[1599.10 → 1600.10] We've just gotten a little soft on that
[1600.10 → 1601.10] Because over the last years
[1601.10 → 1602.10] Basically everyone's just buying NVIDIA cards
[1602.10 → 1603.10] And they pretty much work on everything
[1603.10 → 1604.10] Which is cool
[1604.10 → 1605.10] But
[1605.10 → 1606.10] It's not that much of a lift
[1606.10 → 1608.10] If they want to play like Rocket League
[1608.10 → 1609.10] And League of Legends
[1609.10 → 1610.10] And something else
[1610.10 → 1611.10] Like you're probably fine
[1611.10 → 1612.10] Sweet
[1612.10 → 1614.10] If they want to play Starfield
[1614.10 → 1615.10] Just tell them
[1615.10 → 1616.10] Don't bother
[1616.10 → 1617.10] SteveJ3D here in chat
[1617.10 → 1618.10] Says
[1618.10 → 1619.10] I just had somebody ask today
[1619.10 → 1621.10] About what NVIDIA to get for under $500
[1621.10 → 1623.10] I told them to look for a B580
[1623.10 → 1624.10] NVIDIA doesn't have
[1624.10 → 1625.10] Real options
[1625.10 → 1626.10] That's cool
[1626.10 → 1627.10] Under $500
[1627.10 → 1628.10] Dude
[1628.10 → 1629.10] 599
[1629.10 → 1631.10] Used to be like an ultra
[1632.10 → 1633.10] Card
[1633.10 → 1634.10] Like that was a top tier card
[1634.10 → 1635.10] Yeah very high end
[1635.10 → 1637.10] That's now basically where NVIDIA starts
[1637.10 → 1638.10] Not even that long ago
[1638.10 → 1639.10] That long ago
[1639.10 → 1640.10] Having a valid option at all
[1640.10 → 1641.10] Because I'm not
[1641.10 → 1643.10] I'm not counting these 8GB VRAM cards
[1643.10 → 1645.10] Especially now that Indiana Jones
[1645.10 → 1646.10] And the
[1646.10 → 1647.10] Oh
[1647.10 → 1648.10] What is it?
[1648.10 → 1649.10] What's that?
[1649.10 → 1650.10] It's a great circle right?
[1650.10 → 1651.10] Sixth suggestion from
[1651.10 → 1652.10] LNG community
[1652.10 → 1654.10] In full plane chat
[1654.10 → 1655.10] Yeah great circle
[1655.10 → 1656.10] Chewy
[1656.10 → 1657.10] Sorry
[1657.10 → 1658.10] He said can you combine it with an APU
[1658.10 → 1660.10] And use that to handle older games
[1660.10 → 1662.10] That the B580 might not be good for?
[1662.10 → 1663.10] Yeah possibly actually
[1663.10 → 1664.10] That's actually not a
[1664.10 → 1665.10] Yeah
[1665.10 → 1666.10] Bad start
[1666.10 → 1669.10] I struggle a little bit with especially some very legacy games
[1669.10 → 1670.10] Yeah
[1670.10 → 1673.10] But modern CPUs can probably handle a lot of those
[1673.10 → 1676.10] That actually ties me right back into
[1676.10 → 1679.10] One of the other things that I wanted to talk about here
[1679.10 → 1681.10] I want to call out AMD
[1682.10 → 1685.10] Where are current generation Ry zen 3 chips?
[1686.10 → 1687.10] Where are they?
[1687.10 → 1691.10] I understand people can buy a last generation chip or whatever
[1691.10 → 1693.10] On some ancient architecture
[1693.10 → 1695.10] Or like a two generation old chip for your value segment
[1695.10 → 1696.10] But like
[1698.10 → 1699.10] What the heck?
[1699.10 → 1701.10] You used to have value chips
[1701.10 → 1702.10] You used to launch
[1702.10 → 1703.10] The entire line up
[1703.10 → 1704.10] Ry zen 7
[1704.10 → 1705.10] Ry zen 5
[1705.10 → 1706.10] Ry zen 3
[1706.10 → 1707.10] Like the whole thing was there
[1707.10 → 1709.10] And also you had Thread ripper for consumers
[1709.10 → 1710.10] Remember that?
[1710.10 → 1713.10] Like remember getting people excited about products
[1713.10 → 1715.10] And making stuff because it was really cool
[1715.10 → 1717.10] And because it would delight your customers
[1717.10 → 1719.10] And while we're at it
[1719.10 → 1720.10] And while we're at it
[1720.10 → 1723.10] Where are your non-X Ry zen 9000s?
[1724.10 → 1725.10] Hello?
[1729.10 → 1730.10] We talk about this
[1730.10 → 1731.10] This I think it's an upcoming video
[1731.10 → 1733.10] But we talk about AMD's shift in strategy
[1733.10 → 1736.10] Where they used to launch them at the same time
[1736.10 → 1738.10] The X and the non-X variants
[1738.10 → 1739.10] And then
[1739.10 → 1742.10] Then they started launching the X first
[1742.10 → 1744.10] And following up with the non-X at a lower price
[1744.10 → 1746.10] But like pretty comparable spec
[1746.10 → 1747.10] And now for 9000
[1747.10 → 1749.10] X has been out for months
[1749.10 → 1750.10] We have X3D
[1751.10 → 1753.10] Where the fuck is the regular one?
[1753.10 → 1756.10] No you can just pay for X
[1756.10 → 1758.10] We're doing a lot of Intel praise right now
[1758.10 → 1759.10] But it wasn't even that long ago
[1759.10 → 1761.10] That Intel was the ones on top being big jerks
[1761.10 → 1762.10] Oh 100%
[1763.10 → 1765.10] Just not even bothering to invest in R&D
[1765.10 → 1767.10] And make new chips with higher core counts
[1767.10 → 1768.10] That's what allowed AMD back in the game
[1769.10 → 1770.10] And massively jumping prices
[1770.10 → 1771.10] And doing things like that
[1771.10 → 1773.10] So it's like it's this like
[1773.10 → 1775.10] Remember who got us here comment
[1775.10 → 1776.10] A lot of it's like
[1776.10 → 1778.10] I will genuinely make purchasing decisions
[1778.10 → 1781.10] Based around who's like currently
[1781.10 → 1782.10] Yeah it's like
[1782.10 → 1784.10] What have you done for me lately?
[1784.10 → 1785.10] Yeah
[1785.10 → 1786.10] You should never have brand loyalty
[1786.10 → 1787.10] Yeah
[1787.10 → 1789.10] That doesn't mean that you shouldn't let a brand
[1789.10 → 1791.10] Influence your purchasing decision
[1791.10 → 1792.10] It just means you should ask
[1792.10 → 1794.10] What have you done for me lately?
[1794.10 → 1795.10] Yeah
[1795.10 → 1796.10] Yep
[1797.10 → 1798.10] Yeah
[1798.10 → 1799.10] Because honestly I mean like
[1800.10 → 1801.10] Oh dude
[1801.10 → 1803.10] The people that influenced the decision that you liked
[1803.10 → 1804.10] All those years ago
[1804.10 → 1805.10] Might not even work there anymore
[1805.10 → 1806.10] Yeah
[1806.10 → 1807.10] Yeah
[1807.10 → 1808.10] Like I don't know
[1809.10 → 1810.10] This is a perfect line in our notes
[1810.10 → 1813.10] Instead of just producing enough to meet market demand
[1813.10 → 1815.10] Why don't you guys make something cool
[1815.10 → 1817.10] And stimulate market demand
[1817.10 → 1818.10] Please
[1818.10 → 1819.10] There were some
[1819.10 → 1820.10] Adam did this topic
[1820.10 → 1821.10] He says
[1821.10 → 1823.10] Here's some good value products that we've covered
[1823.10 → 1824.10] Talking to AMD with that last line
[1824.10 → 1825.10] The yeah yes
[1825.10 → 1827.10] Also just the tech industry in general
[1827.10 → 1828.10] But here
[1828.10 → 1829.10] Intel just did is why I clarified there
[1829.10 → 1831.10] Here's some good value stuff that we've covered
[1831.10 → 1833.10] 2024 Mac Mini
[1833.10 → 1834.10] Yeah
[1834.10 → 1837.10] If you ignore the expensive storage upgrades
[1837.10 → 1838.10] Totally
[1838.10 → 1839.10] But that is a legitimately exciting product
[1839.10 → 1840.10] Totally
[1840.10 → 1843.10] I am legitimately excited about the 2024 M4 Mac Mini
[1843.10 → 1844.10] Mac Mini
[1844.10 → 1846.10] Mac Mini's have oddly been pretty good
[1846.10 → 1847.10] But yeah especially 2024
[1847.10 → 1848.10] Oh man his other stuff
[1848.10 → 1849.10] Honestly Adam I don't know
[1849.10 → 1850.10] I think you're reaching
[1850.10 → 1851.10] I think you're
[1851.10 → 1852.10] I think you're
[1852.10 → 1855.10] You've got the modern tech dystopia perspective here
[1855.10 → 1856.10] Because he's got the X3D chips in here
[1856.10 → 1857.10] And they're yeah they're exciting
[1857.10 → 1859.10] But they're like really expensive
[1859.10 → 1863.10] Meta Quest 3 VR yeah we talked about that
[1863.10 → 1866.10] And also Pixel A series question mark
[1866.10 → 1868.10] Like they're just manned there hasn't been
[1868.10 → 1869.10] There really isn't a lot
[1869.10 → 1871.10] I tell this story all the time
[1871.10 → 1874.10] But like when people point out like
[1874.10 → 1876.10] Oh a lot of the stuff that goes on L2D channels
[1876.10 → 1877.10] Just like entertainment stuff these days
[1877.10 → 1878.10] It's like yeah
[1878.10 → 1881.10] It used to be really easy, and now it's really hard
[1881.10 → 1882.10] Now we have to
[1882.10 → 1883.10] We
[1883.10 → 1886.10] The writing team production team all that kind of stuff
[1886.10 → 1890.10] Has to make stuff interesting
[1890.10 → 1892.10] Before stuff was just interesting
[1892.10 → 1893.10] Yeah, and we could just talk about it
[1893.10 → 1895.10] Stuff like this Intel card would just come out all the time
[1895.10 → 1897.10] And it was like oh sweet
[1897.10 → 1898.10] I don't know throw it on bench
[1898.10 → 1899.10] Play with it a little bit
[1899.10 → 1901.10] Yeah it's great sick cool see ya
[1901.10 → 1902.10] Your games run faster
[1902.10 → 1903.10] Like it was just so easy
[1903.10 → 1904.10] There's no downside
[1904.10 → 1905.10] Yeah nice
[1905.10 → 1908.10] And then now it's like oh man okay
[1908.10 → 1909.10] We have to I don't know I'll
[1909.10 → 1912.10] I'll do some I don't know whatever thing
[1912.10 → 1914.10] I see people complaining that we
[1914.10 → 1917.10] We don't do enough GPU reviews and CPU reviews anymore
[1917.10 → 1918.10] They're our duty!
[1918.10 → 1920.10] Like what are we supposed to review?
[1920.10 → 1921.10] Where are they?
[1921.10 → 1925.10] Like we get a new family of GPUs like once every almost two years
[1925.10 → 1927.10] What am I supposed to do with that?
[1927.10 → 1929.10] I can't keep reviewing it
[1929.10 → 1932.10] If I did you'd ask why I keep reviewing the same GPU
[1932.10 → 1934.10] I don't make GPUs
[1934.10 → 1938.10] I don't make GPUs
[1938.10 → 1939.10] I don't come out that often
[1939.10 → 1940.10] That's the 4060
[1940.10 → 1942.10] That's a year and a half ago
[1942.10 → 1944.10] If we look at the 4080
[1945.10 → 1946.10] It's 2022
[1946.10 → 1948.10] That's two years ago
[1948.10 → 1950.10] November so it's even slightly more
[1950.10 → 1952.10] We still don't have a 5080
[1952.10 → 1953.10] Yeah
[1953.10 → 1955.10] What do you want us to do?
[1955.10 → 1957.10] Two years
[1957.10 → 1960.10] And the prices don't even come down
[1960.10 → 1962.10] So in the chat review it again
[1962.10 → 1963.10] Review it again
[1963.10 → 1966.10] No!
[1966.10 → 1975.10] But yeah so like okay back in the day when it was like eight months between GPU cycles
[1975.10 → 1977.10] Oh yeah that was a long time ago though
[1977.10 → 1979.10] That was before we were even in media but
[1979.10 → 1980.10] Fair but still
[1980.10 → 1982.10] Still annual cycles were nice
[1982.10 → 1983.10] It's a little easier
[1983.10 → 1984.10] Annual cycles were nice
[1984.10 → 1986.10] Now when it's every over two years
[1986.10 → 1990.10] Like it's its I don't know I don't know how when it's going to be, but it's going to be over two years
[1990.10 → 1992.10] Considering we just saw it's already been over two years
[1993.10 → 1995.10] What do you do in the meantime?
[1995.10 → 1997.10] And when that's happening to every vertical
[1997.10 → 1998.10] Yep
[1998.10 → 2002.10] A lot of other verticals just feel like their kind of maturing out a little bit
[2004.10 → 2007.10] And like to be clear I feel like our team does a perfect job
[2007.10 → 2008.10] They do a great job
[2009.10 → 2010.10] Fantastic job
[2010.10 → 2011.10] They're killing it
[2011.10 → 2012.10] But it's just
[2013.10 → 2014.10] It's so hard
[2015.10 → 2018.10] Because you have to create the concept
[2019.10 → 2020.10] Instead of just having cool things
[2021.10 → 2024.10] Like we would walk into the office and there'd be a pile of interesting things in the corner
[2025.10 → 2026.10] Yeah
[2026.10 → 2027.10] It was just like okay sick
[2027.10 → 2028.10] Yeah we
[2028.10 → 2031.10] We'll have to prioritize which cool interesting thing to talk about
[2031.10 → 2032.10] Yeah
[2032.10 → 2033.10] That is not the problem anymore
[2034.10 → 2035.10] Oh man
[2036.10 → 2037.10] Anyway
[2038.10 → 2039.10] Anyway Dan we've done two topics
[2040.10 → 2041.10] Okay thanks I'm a little swamped
[2042.10 → 2043.10] Oh
[2043.10 → 2045.10] What? Are you getting merch message inundated today?
[2045.10 → 2046.10] What's even going on today?
[2046.10 → 2048.10] It's been 40 minutes, and I've had 200
[2049.10 → 2051.10] It's been 40 minutes?
[2052.10 → 2053.10] That's a while
[2053.10 → 2054.10] Wow
[2054.10 → 2055.10] Look at us go
[2055.10 → 2057.10] I can dance all day
[2057.10 → 2062.10] Is it just because we're close to Christmas and people are trying to get stuff?
[2062.10 → 2065.10] I mean look at the top banner of the site
[2066.10 → 2071.10] Precision multi-bit screwdriver bit sets and end caps are restocking
[2072.10 → 2073.10] Oh
[2073.10 → 2074.10] Back orders are live now
[2075.10 → 2076.10] Please help
[2076.10 → 2077.10] Oh
[2077.10 → 2078.10] Oh
[2078.10 → 2079.10] Yes
[2079.10 → 2080.10] Oh
[2080.10 → 2082.10] Okay well let's do a couple merch messages then if you've done two topics
[2082.10 → 2083.10] That makes sense
[2083.10 → 2084.10] When's the mod map coming out?
[2085.10 → 2086.10] Uh
[2087.10 → 2088.10] There's my merch message
[2088.10 → 2089.10] New year I think
[2089.10 → 2090.10] Okay
[2090.10 → 2091.10] Luke asks
[2091.10 → 2092.10] Sorry
[2092.10 → 2093.10] Sorry
[2093.10 → 2094.10] Sorry
[2094.10 → 2095.10] Go for it
[2097.10 → 2098.10] When's the mod map coming out?
[2099.10 → 2100.10] Hi LLD
[2100.10 → 2101.10] Great to see the precision screw
[2101.10 → 2103.10] Nope that is an incoming
[2103.10 → 2104.10] Sorry I'm losing it
[2105.10 → 2106.10] It starts exactly the same
[2106.10 → 2107.10] Hey LLD
[2108.10 → 2111.10] Just wanted to say the MCM product suite is phenomenal
[2111.10 → 2114.10] Finally had a chance to redo my setup when I moved, and I couldn't be happier
[2114.10 → 2115.10] Nice
[2115.10 → 2116.10] What's next in that product category?
[2116.10 → 2117.10] I need more
[2118.10 → 2119.10] Oh
[2119.10 → 2120.10] Uh
[2121.10 → 2122.10] We are
[2122.10 → 2125.10] I think we're working on a smaller power brick holder
[2126.10 → 2128.10] Um like for like little tiny power bricks
[2128.10 → 2129.10] The current one
[2129.10 → 2132.10] Uh is a little bit tricky to use on really, really small stuff
[2132.10 → 2133.10] Okay
[2133.10 → 2138.10] Uh I believe we're working on I think we're in the early stages
[2138.10 → 2141.10] It may never see the light of day if it doesn't reach our quality standards
[2141.10 → 2145.10] But I believe we're in the early stages of a like an arch with like a flex middle
[2146.10 → 2147.10] Whoa
[2147.10 → 2151.10] So that you could kind of stretch it out and have it be like flatter or put it together and have it be like taller
[2152.10 → 2154.10] It may not end up making any sense
[2154.10 → 2156.10] Um I know that we are
[2157.10 → 2158.10] What else are we working on?
[2158.10 → 2159.10] I
[2159.10 → 2160.10] Oh this is cool
[2160.10 → 2161.10] Now that
[2161.10 → 2165.10] I've been promised that this will be coming very, very soon
[2165.10 → 2167.10] Even though I've been asking for it for like two years
[2168.10 → 2169.10] Um
[2170.10 → 2172.10] Could you like bungee?
[2173.10 → 2175.10] Between two magnetic ends?
[2175.10 → 2176.10] I don't know maybe
[2176.10 → 2181.10] Then you just take one end off to access the cables and put the other end put the end back on?
[2181.10 → 2184.10] That would be very complicated tooling I don't know about that
[2184.10 → 2185.10] Okay
[2185.10 → 2186.10] Maybe it's a cool idea
[2186.10 → 2196.10] Um one thing that I know is coming is we create all kinds of like cool 3d printed internal tools and holders and adapters and all kinds of cool stuff
[2196.10 → 2197.10] Yeah, screwdriver holders are cool
[2197.10 → 2200.10] Like we have for the for the little um
[2200.10 → 2203.10] Quarter 20 threaded power bar holder
[2203.10 → 2205.10] Um MCM like magnetic thing
[2205.10 → 2210.10] Uh we have a little screwdriver holder that can go onto it, and then you can just like put your screwdriver into it
[2210.10 → 2217.10] And, so I've been just super irate every time I see stuff like that, and I'm like yo why don't we share any of this with our community?
[2217.10 → 2225.10] So we are finally going to be publishing like a repo of just like all the cool stuff that we design internally
[2225.10 → 2227.10] L2 store like maker add-ons
[2227.10 → 2234.10] Um not even because a lot of it's just like stuff we just use internally that has nothing to do with maker like our CPU holders
[2234.10 → 2236.10] And stuff like that
[2236.10 → 2238.10] Yeah, but if you're 3d printing it isn't it like maker to a certain degree?
[2238.10 → 2239.10] Yeah, sure I guess so
[2239.10 → 2240.10] I don't know
[2240.10 → 2241.10] Your Sonos wall holders are up there
[2241.10 → 2245.10] Yeah, yeah, so we're so we are finally going to be publishing that bloody thing
[2245.10 → 2252.10] Um, I love the idea of like oh I lost my little the little plastic thing my CPU came in I can 3d print a new one
[2252.10 → 2256.10] Yeah, that's sick, and we have those, and they're awesome. Yeah, and they're they're already designed. So
[2257.10 → 2264.10] Yes, we should definitely do that. Uh, oh tiny is apparently in the chat right now, and he says possibly question mark
[2264.10 → 2266.10] so I have no idea what that means, but I
[2266.10 → 2271.10] Keep up the good work time that was to the bungee thing. Oh, really? Oh, okay. Cool. Cool
[2271.10 → 2273.10] Cool, but he said that before you said oh
[2273.10 → 2281.10] Oh what you said oh a big part of the like MCM line is going to be our cables to go with the cable management stuff
[2281.10 → 2288.10] Yes, I'm very excited about our cables. Please dude the quality. Yes the quality. Yes. I am
[2288.10 → 2292.10] I've been I've been overdue to kind of modernize a little bit
[2292.10 → 2298.10] I'm still on type a for a fair amount of things, and I've it's not too much but a fair amount of things, and I've been I've been waiting
[2298.10 → 2301.10] I've been waiting dude. They are
[2301.10 → 2302.10] Um
[2302.10 → 2304.10] Someone
[2304.10 → 2309.10] I don't know who doesn't matter. Someone's going to cut them open, and they're going to be like
[2310.10 → 2311.10] Damn
[2312.10 → 2317.10] They're just their quality nice. Yeah, quality inside note. I'm I'm really excited about them
[2317.10 → 2323.10] All right. All right. I got one more, and then we'll do some announcements. Okay, got the OG screwdriver
[2323.10 → 2330.10] Happy to get the stubby and precision just started a new job any advice how to help myself stand out and become more valuable for the company?
[2330.10 → 2335.10] Man, okay. I got some I got some shameless advice
[2335.10 → 2344.10] Why is it shameless? Because a lot of people I think are too modest, and they feel awkward about sort of
[2344.10 → 2351.10] Claim your work pumping up. Yeah, pumping up their own achievements when you do something that like goes well
[2352.10 → 2359.10] Talk about it. I think that's honestly one of the biggest issues that I saw like back when I was at NCI right?
[2359.10 → 2363.10] Because like as the CEO or chief vision officer whatever roles I've had here
[2363.10 → 2366.10] I have you know, I have a lot less visibility into
[2367.10 → 2373.10] Not too much every single person is doing. Yeah, and it's a very different perspective
[2373.10 → 2377.10] And then being like a rank and filer at NCI
[2377.10 → 2384.10] I had my sort of bottom-up perspective and what I will say is consistent between both of those perspectives
[2384.10 → 2392.10] Is that whether it's the individual contributors that are working for me or whether it's my peers that are working for the company
[2392.10 → 2395.10] Is there are people who do great work?
[2397.10 → 2398.10] Super quietly
[2399.10 → 2400.10] Don't stand out
[2401.10 → 2406.10] Don't point out anything good that they do, and they don't possibly get passed up. They don't get the recognition
[2406.10 → 2411.10] Sometimes they sometimes do they do, but often they don't, but that relies on their boss to be kind of awesome
[2411.10 → 2416.10] Yes, pay attention and be on top of it and let's face it. Come on folks
[2417.10 → 2424.10] Is your boss awesome and on top of it and always paying attention to what you do in like a positive way?
[2425.10 → 2427.10] Don't Dan don't answer that
[2427.10 → 2428.10] Don't answer that
[2428.10 → 2429.10] Don't
[2429.10 → 2430.10] No, no
[2433.10 → 2436.10] Luke just said no. No, I did not. I like working with Taryn. Leave me alone
[2437.10 → 2439.10] So that that's what I was such a bait
[2442.10 → 2448.10] That's what I want you to do if you think you're doing a great job then I want you to make sure that you tell people about it
[2448.10 → 2450.10] Make sure that they know don't be boastful
[2450.10 → 2452.10] Don't let it be constant just
[2453.10 → 2459.10] You don't slip it in once in a while especially if there's is especially is there's someone higher up the rung present
[2460.10 → 2464.10] and if you don't think you're doing a great job, and you don't have anything to talk about then
[2465.10 → 2466.10] Kind of maybe figure that out
[2467.10 → 2469.10] I'd be fine find something good to talk about. Yeah
[2470.10 → 2475.10] You also don't want to yeah, you don't want to be annoying. It shouldn't be the only thing you talk about
[2475.10 → 2478.10] But bring it up claim your work
[2478.10 → 2483.10] Oh, and I another this is actually really great disorderly says when I did tech support one time I went on vacation
[2483.10 → 2486.10] My boss volunteered to do my job when I got back from vacation. She gave me a raise
[2486.10 → 2491.10] That's actually a really key point as well is taken your PTO
[2492.10 → 2498.10] Take your time off and make sure that by the time you take it because it sounds like you're in a new job
[2498.10 → 2502.10] So you might not be eligible for a little bit make sure that by the time you take it you're hard to cover for
[2502.10 → 2508.10] That is impossible to ignore if you take your time off and the team
[2509.10 → 2510.10] What?
[2511.10 → 2514.10] No, not put obstructions in the way
[2514.10 → 2517.10] That's a hundred percent how a ton of people are going to take that
[2517.10 → 2521.10] That's not so many people. That's not so many people. That's not the way
[2522.10 → 2525.10] That's not the way
[2525.10 → 2532.10] He means be so good. Yes, not like don't do documentation or whatever else
[2532.10 → 2538.10] The company doesn't have this topic company doesn't implode when you take a day off
[2538.10 → 2544.10] If your manager notices that you're not doing documentation there that you're not doing good documentation
[2544.10 → 2546.10] You might just get fired for that reason. So be careful
[2547.10 → 2550.10] Yes, and just be difficult to replace because you're good
[2551.10 → 2558.10] So take your PTO and be in a position where when you get back people are grateful to have you back
[2559.10 → 2562.10] Yes, because they're like man. I don't know how we do this without you
[2563.10 → 2566.10] That's that's what you want people thinking about you
[2566.10 → 2572.10] It's very annoying when AJ goes on vacation because he doesn't document anything I get messaged all the time
[2573.10 → 2574.10] And I'm like, oh
[2575.10 → 2576.10] That means where's AJ?
[2577.10 → 2582.10] That means he's doing work. Oh, yeah, he's like that's good doing whatever he's doing. Don't know that Matt
[2583.10 → 2584.10] Gas
[2585.10 → 2587.10] Oh
[2589.10 → 2595.10] Jojo that's perfect. He doesn't need to do anything more. That's doing great. Jojo web says okay
[2595.10 → 2599.10] I'm going to unplug our company server and go on vacation. Thanks for the tip
[2601.10 → 2602.10] Luke he gives such great advice
[2603.10 → 2604.10] What?
[2605.10 → 2606.10] Oh man
[2607.10 → 2611.10] Giving Luke pre-TSD? That's pretty funny
[2614.10 → 2616.10] Okay, what are we supposed to be doing Dan? Merch messages. Oh
[2617.10 → 2618.10] We only did one though. Wait
[2619.10 → 2620.10] We never explained merch messages
[2620.10 → 2621.10] Oh
[2621.10 → 2624.10] Oh leave a merch message you got to go to LTT store.com
[2624.10 → 2626.10] We don't do just throwing money at the screen

[2652.10 → 2653.10] Yeah, absolutely
[2654.10 → 2657.10] There's a new tech enthusiast born every minute, and we're going to get a merch message from them
[2658.10 → 2659.10] Especially from Intel apparently
[2659.10 → 2661.10] Especially yeah. Oh, dude. Thank you, Intel, for
[2662.10 → 2665.10] I mean I remember when I was back at NCI like my old boss
[2666.10 → 2671.10] Jack was like yeah, I mean the entire industry basically lives or dies by Microsoft and Intel
[2672.10 → 2673.10] Innovating on a cycle because
[2674.10 → 2678.10] New windows boom explosion PC sales new Intel processor
[2678.10 → 2685.10] Everyone else is just sitting waiting with bated breath for them to release something new that's faster and better so that people need RAM and
[2685.10 → 2689.10] Motherboards and graphics cards and okay, well, I'm spending anyway
[2689.10 → 2690.10] I'm going to get a keyboard and mouse and like
[2691.10 → 2694.10] We've been without a driver the bus has just been
[2695.10 → 2698.10] Cruising down the road with no driver for years
[2699.10 → 2702.10] We need someone to drive it, and it's like Intel sure as heck not doing it on the CPU side
[2703.10 → 2706.10] But dang it the GPU division stand stepping up, and I'm loving it. All right
[2706.10 → 2708.10] All right

[2720.10 → 2723.10] Well, some of them are quick some of them are quick. Okay available now
[2724.10 → 2726.10] The floppy disk notebook
[2727.10 → 2734.10] Save all your precious notes on the floppy disk notebook. It's a blank page notebook with terrible pages
[2734.10 → 2738.10] No, sorry rip-able. They're good. They're not terrible
[2739.10 → 2747.10] Why don't you even let me pitch the product this one has notes in it if it's its an across
[2748.10 → 2750.10] Sorry, what this one has notes in what who wrote that?
[2750.10 → 2752.10] It's like notes are not included power breakfast
[2753.10 → 2754.10] That looks like Sarah's writing. Oh
[2755.10 → 2762.10] Anyway, if it's an across body bag or even a jacket pocket meals with ease and comes with 200 perforated pages for your convenience terrible pages
[2763.10 → 2771.10] Designed by our lovely Sarah, but it is available in gray or teal you can get it now at leg.GG slash floppy
[2771.10 → 2773.10] What else we got?
[2774.10 → 2775.10] Uh, what is this?
[2776.10 → 2782.10] An announcement a ton of you have been waiting for underneath the table. There's a stocking
[2783.10 → 2784.10] What?
[2785.10 → 2786.10] Oh
[2789.10 → 2792.10] It's like not close to life at all laying on the ground
[2792.10 → 2793.10] Re
[2793.10 → 2794.10] Oops
[2794.10 → 2795.10] Re

[2802.10 → 2803.10] The bit set
[2804.10 → 2809.10] There you go the case and precision bit set for the precision driver
[2810.10 → 2817.10] Okay, and the end cap set which has the the different profiles of end caps the
[2817.10 → 2820.10] The convex the flat and the concave
[2821.10 → 2825.10] They are finally restocking, but you already know that because we spoiled it 10 minutes ago
[2826.10 → 2827.10] Yeah
[2828.10 → 2831.10] Back when we launched these back in September we couldn't imagine how much you all were going to want them
[2831.10 → 2833.10] You literally sold us out in 72 hours which we appreciate
[2834.10 → 2837.10] So we ordered a lot more a lot more, but who knows they might go fast again
[2838.10 → 2840.10] So we'd suggest getting them while you can
[2841.10 → 2846.10] The case with 60 long reach bits a detachable hinge and convenient magnetic parts tray
[2846.10 → 2851.10] And an adapter so you can use these bits with the regular Ltd screwdriver or really any other quarter
[2852.10 → 2857.10] Shank screwdriver is available by itself for $29.99 or in a bundle with the precision multi bit screwdriver
[2857.10 → 2859.10] Which saves you 10 bucks compared to buying both separately
[2860.10 → 2867.10] Everything is available for order at leg.GG slash bit set so you can get that stuff there get the combo or get the case
[2868.10 → 2870.10] What else do we have to announce?
[2871.10 → 2872.10] What else do we have to announce? Is there anything else?
[2872.10 → 2873.10] What is there?
[2873.10 → 2876.10] Okay this says watch video is this going to be like weird and awkward again?
[2877.10 → 2879.10] Are they giving us a full length video or?
[2880.10 → 2881.10] No, no.
[2881.10 → 2882.10] What are we looking at here?
[2882.10 → 2883.10] Okay so watch video

[2890.10 → 2891.10] Oh no, no you're going to watch
[2891.10 → 2893.10] We're watching two videos?
[2893.10 → 2894.10] That's the wrong video
[2894.10 → 2895.10] What?
[2895.10 → 2896.10] This is the wrong video
[2896.10 → 2897.10] Which one are you on? Oh, that one? No, that's you
[2897.10 → 2898.10] Oh yeah go for it

[2906.10 → 2907.10] Oh heck yeah
[2907.10 → 2910.10] So I think we should make this our next merch idea
[2910.10 → 2911.10] Sick
[2911.10 → 2915.10] I'm Linus and I would like to say yeah that looks like a good idea
[2915.10 → 2917.10] I drop things because I'm a silly guy
[2917.10 → 2920.10] Are you going to take more suggestions from the Flow plane livestream?

[2931.10 → 2932.10] I'm Colton
[2932.10 → 2938.10] The business team would be excited about this initiative as it aligns with our strategic objectives and KPIs while raising stakeholder value
[2938.10 → 2941.10] By leveraging this opportunity we can drive incremental
[2941.10 → 2946.10] Join us December 19th at 10am and have more suggestions for what we should be designing
[2946.10 → 2948.10] See you there
[2949.10 → 2950.10] That was great
[2950.10 → 2951.10] What are we even doing?
[2951.10 → 2953.10] Every time I'm featured they just say chicken a bunch of times
[2953.10 → 2954.10] My goodness
[2954.10 → 2958.10] Okay so Sarah's going to be doing a float plane livestream

[2962.10 → 2963.10] A shirt okay
[2963.10 → 2965.10] And it looks like maybe it's blue this time
[2965.10 → 2966.10] Okay

[2979.10 → 2981.10] And the hangar is created a warehouse
[2981.10 → 2983.10] But maybe you can beat my suggestion
[2983.10 → 2984.10] Leave it on float plane
[2984.10 → 2985.10] I think they can beat that suggestion
[2985.10 → 2986.10] Probably
[2986.10 → 2987.10] I think they can beat it
[2987.10 → 2988.10] And they're float planers
[2988.10 → 2989.10] I'm sure they can beat it
[2989.10 → 2990.10] I tried to leave like that
[2990.10 → 2991.10] They beat it every day

[3092.72 → 3096.10] I saw so many people.

[3118.78 → 3119.18] Okay.
[3119.18 → 3121.06] 149.99.
[3121.50 → 3121.74] Yeah.
[3122.08 → 3122.34] Yeah.
[3122.72 → 3123.08] It's.

[3123.86 → 3124.56] People are saying good price.
[3124.66 → 3124.86] Okay.

[3132.22 → 3132.46] Dang.
[3133.42 → 3135.50] You're hoping for, you're hoping for a dream.
[3135.50 → 3141.46] Uh, dyslexic stoner 240 said terrible price could have done 149.97.
[3142.50 → 3142.74] So.

[3146.90 → 3147.70] I'm so sorry.
[3148.06 → 3149.30] I'll do better next time.
[3149.74 → 3150.24] Dyslexic stoner.
[3150.36 → 3152.56] You should have played into the joke and done.
[3152.66 → 3154.20] You could have done 149.99.
[3154.44 → 3155.92] Did we announce when it'll be available?
[3156.22 → 3157.06] Was that in the thing?
[3158.18 → 3158.54] Uh.
[3158.90 → 3160.50] December 26th.
[3160.72 → 3161.72] December 26th.
[3161.72 → 3165.58] Boxing Day here in Canada, which is kind of like what used to be our Black Friday.
[3165.92 → 3166.80] You can sign up.
[3167.58 → 3168.88] Um, there's a site.
[3169.30 → 3170.78] LEG.GG slash commuter.
[3171.74 → 3174.34] And this is, this is really important.
[3174.34 → 3179.68] If you're interested in the commuter bag, you should go sign up now for the launch notification.
[3180.08 → 3181.74] LEG.GG slash commuter.
[3181.94 → 3190.30] Because at launch for a very finite something, we are doing something we have never done before
[3190.30 → 3191.94] with a new product launch on LTT store.
[3192.44 → 3193.04] Oh yeah.
[3193.16 → 3195.90] And you are going to want to know right away because.
[3196.08 → 3196.78] Oh, we're not telling them.
[3196.84 → 3197.64] Because it's finite.
[3197.94 → 3198.78] I don't even know what it is.
[3199.20 → 3200.86] Finite means not infinite.
[3201.38 → 3201.72] Hmm.
[3202.22 → 3202.98] So it's limited.
[3203.14 → 3203.98] It's outside finite.
[3204.16 → 3204.46] Yes.
[3204.62 → 3204.88] Oh.
[3205.10 → 3205.28] Yeah.
[3205.32 → 3206.12] It's out finite.
[3206.72 → 3207.16] Yep.
[3208.44 → 3213.92] Don't let your friend be finite while you are out finite.
[3214.54 → 3215.42] Wait, in front.
[3215.50 → 3217.48] No, the point is sign up for the thing.
[3217.50 → 3217.84] Yes.
[3217.84 → 3218.92] All right.
[3220.14 → 3222.46] Finally, fire pole.
[3222.94 → 3223.54] What is that?
[3223.58 → 3224.66] It's a pole that's fire.
[3225.22 → 3226.50] Oh, no way.
[3227.00 → 3227.94] Wan hoodie V3.
[3228.88 → 3230.24] There are two options.
[3230.72 → 3235.22] Dan, can you, can you help the people, can you help the people respond to the pole?
[3235.42 → 3236.48] So let me explain.
[3236.62 → 3238.18] Let me explain before you publish it.
[3238.58 → 3240.80] Tell me before you publish it because I want to explain.
[3241.00 → 3241.14] Yep.
[3241.14 → 3247.34] There's two different possible vibes for the upcoming Wan hoodie V3.
[3247.34 → 3255.10] This one is more like the original sort of Wan hoodie, the V1 and the V2.
[3255.34 → 3258.68] It's got the orange accents with the gray on the black.
[3258.68 → 3261.50] That's cool.
[3261.74 → 3263.56] It's also got just an updated design.
[3263.74 → 3266.76] It's very similar fit to the older ones, but a little bit updated.
[3267.22 → 3270.90] It doesn't have the same sort of bunching in the sleeves, so it's a little bit easier
[3270.90 → 3271.62] to kind of roll up.
[3271.62 → 3271.88] Yeah, that's nice.
[3272.02 → 3273.44] So there's a few little nice to haves.
[3273.54 → 3274.38] It's covered in pockets.
[3274.38 → 3277.62] All the things that you love about, you know, Wan hoodie.
[3277.62 → 3279.16] But here's the thing.
[3279.78 → 3284.98] The Wan hoodie branding is not orange and has never been orange.
[3285.14 → 3285.64] The Wan branding.
[3285.98 → 3286.24] Yeah.
[3286.52 → 3287.12] You said Wan hoodie.
[3287.26 → 3287.36] Yeah.
[3287.48 → 3288.02] The Wan branding.
[3288.16 → 3294.48] The branding for the Wan show has always been kind of red.
[3295.26 → 3296.72] It has never been orange.
[3296.96 → 3299.70] Yeah, like not these bars on the side of merch messages.
[3299.74 → 3301.56] He's talking about the logo over there.
[3301.60 → 3302.36] This here.
[3302.68 → 3302.94] Yeah.
[3302.94 → 3303.00] Yeah.
[3303.10 → 3306.04] Because that thing under it is a...
[3306.04 → 3306.30] There.
[3306.30 → 3306.34] There.
[3307.44 → 3307.62] Yeah.
[3307.64 → 3308.16] The hexagon.
[3308.26 → 3309.44] The best of gone that's down there.
[3309.62 → 3309.78] Yeah.
[3310.28 → 3312.00] So that's...
[3312.00 → 3312.78] B8 to C25.
[3313.14 → 3315.14] Did we do that on purpose or did we just screw up?
[3315.24 → 3315.42] No.
[3315.54 → 3317.58] The Wan show branding has just always been red.
[3317.70 → 3317.98] Okay.
[3318.24 → 3318.44] Yeah.
[3319.02 → 3324.70] So this is actually more true to the Wan show.
[3325.46 → 3327.16] They are the exact same hoodie.
[3327.62 → 3331.60] The only difference is that this is actually based on the Wan show colours.
[3332.08 → 3333.16] And this...
[3333.16 → 3334.42] Which is gray and red.
[3334.42 → 3339.16] Is more like the black and orange, you know, Wan hoodie colours.
[3339.70 → 3341.22] So Dan, go ahead.
[3341.50 → 3342.50] You guys are going to decide.
[3342.58 → 3343.80] We're only making one of them.
[3344.18 → 3345.24] So we've got red and orange.
[3345.80 → 3346.08] Yes.
[3346.60 → 3346.80] Okay.
[3346.94 → 3347.98] I'll do two minutes.
[3348.14 → 3348.42] Okay.
[3348.56 → 3349.40] Here comes the poll.
[3349.60 → 3351.54] Somebody was asking for a Firefox option.
[3351.70 → 3352.74] I did Firefox poll.
[3354.06 → 3354.46] Okay.
[3354.50 → 3355.20] Show results.
[3356.20 → 3356.74] All right.
[3356.74 → 3361.28] So we're going to let you guys fester on that for a little bit.
[3361.36 → 3362.04] And then, okay.
[3362.08 → 3362.82] What should we do in the meantime?
[3364.92 → 3366.04] I think we're out of announcements.
[3366.44 → 3366.74] Oh, yeah.
[3366.88 → 3367.16] Finally.
[3367.56 → 3370.26] So we could do another topic.
[3370.38 → 3371.38] We could do a merch message.
[3371.60 → 3372.20] One more topic.
[3372.40 → 3373.54] There aren't a lot of topics.
[3373.64 → 3374.74] We might want to hit a merch message.
[3374.90 → 3375.66] Whatever you want, Luke.
[3376.02 → 3376.76] Whatever's good for you.
[3376.86 → 3377.84] Let's do two merch messages.
[3378.04 → 3378.22] Sure.
[3379.06 → 3379.92] Linus, Luke, and Dan.
[3380.04 → 3384.92] With Meta offering the option to reset your algorithm, should YouTube also follow suit?
[3385.36 → 3387.94] Maybe end the brain rot once for all.
[3388.26 → 3389.42] I don't think that'll end the brain rot.
[3389.50 → 3390.18] No, it won't end the brain.
[3390.18 → 3391.06] The brain rot will happen again.
[3391.14 → 3397.80] I actually had a conversation with my son last night because he watches a little bit more YouTube
[3397.80 → 3399.18] than I'd probably prefer.
[3400.06 → 3403.06] He's at the age now where we don't want to just like...
[3403.06 → 3403.56] Because I could.
[3403.58 → 3405.78] I could just lock how much he can watch it or whatever.
[3405.78 → 3408.20] But he's getting to the age now where these need to be...
[3408.20 → 3409.10] Trying to get him to make decisions.
[3409.28 → 3410.32] These need to be conversations.
[3410.54 → 3412.18] These need to be decisions that he makes.
[3412.28 → 3416.60] And it's like, you know, the analogy that Yvonne was drawing when we were discussing,
[3416.78 → 3419.74] you know, just parenting strategies was like, it's like when my parents told me I couldn't
[3419.74 → 3420.02] date.
[3420.72 → 3422.40] The only difference was that they just didn't know.
[3422.56 → 3422.76] Yeah.
[3423.00 → 3423.22] Right?
[3423.32 → 3428.92] And so we have to accept that at a certain point, kids are going to not listen to everything
[3428.92 → 3429.38] you say.
[3429.94 → 3431.94] And you've got to arm them for that, right?
[3432.00 → 3435.54] And so on of the things that I was talking to him about, I pulled up my Google News feed.
[3435.54 → 3437.88] And I basically went, so here's the thing.
[3438.08 → 3441.40] It takes a ton of discipline.
[3443.50 → 3447.42] But you can actually tune these algorithms because a lot of the shorts that he's getting
[3447.42 → 3450.84] fed, it's shorts in particular that are kind of worrying because he's been watching more
[3450.84 → 3451.22] shorts.
[3451.90 → 3455.68] And a lot of them are pretty like kind of educational and science-y.
[3455.92 → 3459.12] So he's actually been doing a good job of what I asked him to do, which is, hey, if
[3459.12 → 3463.14] you're just watching Brain Rot on YouTube, that counts as screen time.
[3463.14 → 3464.36] You need to talk to us about it.
[3464.42 → 3467.22] But if you're watching educational content, I don't mind.
[3467.30 → 3468.36] You can do that whenever you want.
[3468.56 → 3471.90] So he's actually been doing a good job of tuning the algorithm a little bit.
[3472.02 → 3474.74] There's so much perfect educational content on YouTube, too.
[3474.74 → 3475.52] There really is.
[3475.76 → 3475.98] Yeah.
[3476.20 → 3476.30] Endless while.
[3476.30 → 3479.30] But he's also clearly still getting fed Brain Rot garbage.
[3479.40 → 3479.54] Right.
[3479.54 → 3483.46] And so what I did was I pulled out my phone to use as an example to show him like, hey,
[3483.56 → 3487.34] look, if I'm looking at news about, if I click on something about the royals or whatever,
[3487.72 → 3492.80] it's going to be full of just like gossip bull spit for a long time.
[3492.96 → 3496.88] And if you are super, super disciplined, you can actually tune these algorithms to feed you
[3496.88 → 3497.82] perfect content.
[3498.02 → 3498.58] And so I showed him.
[3498.64 → 3502.28] I was like, look, okay, we've got sort of politics, world events, tech.
[3502.84 → 3506.82] We've got like all the things that I sort of generally follow.
[3507.12 → 3510.54] And without exception, there's like actually no junk in my newsfeed anymore.
[3510.60 → 3511.50] But that takes a long time.
[3511.58 → 3514.90] And I know because I just had to retrain it because I switched from my work account to
[3514.90 → 3515.28] my...
[3515.28 → 3515.78] Sorry?
[3516.14 → 3516.72] Unless you're an ex.
[3517.00 → 3517.92] Oh, well, yeah, sure.
[3518.88 → 3519.90] What happened to the poll?
[3520.78 → 3521.98] Oh, the red one.
[3522.76 → 3523.10] Oh, okay.
[3523.18 → 3523.96] It wasn't even close.
[3524.02 → 3525.22] It was like 69% red.
[3525.30 → 3525.46] Nice.
[3526.50 → 3530.12] Anyway, so back to the conversation around just like algorithms.
[3530.12 → 3538.48] I think that it would be very beneficial to be able to reset it, right?
[3539.06 → 3545.76] But to Luke's point, having gone through that process very recently of retraining mine,
[3545.88 → 3550.70] because I switched from my work account for my Google account, like my main Google account
[3550.70 → 3552.98] on my phone, to my personal account.
[3553.12 → 3556.48] And the reason I did that was because there are certain functions that don't work in Google
[3556.48 → 3558.48] Assistant if you have a Google...
[3558.48 → 3559.60] What's it called?
[3559.68 → 3560.24] Google G Suite.
[3560.34 → 3561.34] If you have a G Suite account.
[3561.68 → 3564.66] And I just got tired of just like stuff not working.
[3564.78 → 3566.06] And I was like, finally, like, okay, fine.
[3566.08 → 3571.50] I'll just retrain this piece of garbage because my newsfeed sucks on my personal account and
[3571.50 → 3573.94] was like really finely tuned on my work account.
[3574.48 → 3580.36] So it probably took me like three or four months to get it to the point where, A, I've retrained
[3580.36 → 3583.74] my brain to not see ads in the feed anymore because my work account didn't have any.
[3584.24 → 3586.20] And my personal one does.
[3586.54 → 3591.06] So I had to train my brain and then also trained my feed to not give me garbage that I don't
[3591.06 → 3591.52] want to read.
[3591.86 → 3595.30] Oh, the other thing that typically ends up is like science, especially like astronomy,
[3595.70 → 3599.56] science and like material science.
[3599.56 → 3603.08] For some reason, I've clicked enough things about like lithium batteries that it's like,
[3603.16 → 3604.88] oh, hey, there's a new graphene, you know, whatever.
[3605.10 → 3606.40] And like, are you interested in this?
[3606.74 → 3608.00] So I ended up with a lot of that stuff.
[3608.00 → 3609.38] And it takes a really long time.
[3609.48 → 3612.94] So I think it's a double-edged sword is the bottom line answer to this.
[3613.22 → 3616.54] I think it could be a perfect thing if you feel like things have gotten a little bit
[3616.54 → 3619.40] out of control, and you like to want to do a breather and reset.
[3619.60 → 3626.16] But I also think that it could, you could be better off if you have the discipline retraining
[3626.16 → 3626.62] it yourself.
[3626.62 → 3630.92] So we kind of had a conversation with him about like, yeah, this is a feed that
[3630.92 → 3636.80] can be useful, but it actually takes so much more discipline when things are just kind
[3636.80 → 3643.42] of being served up in front of you compared to going out and seeking content like the
[3643.42 → 3644.24] way that we used to.
[3644.42 → 3646.74] So I don't know how much of this is going to stick.
[3646.82 → 3650.30] I don't know how much of it's going to sink in, but trying to have these conversations
[3650.30 → 3651.64] come and go a little bit, too.
[3651.76 → 3655.64] I think I've talked about this on WAN show before, but I my one of my favourite lines about
[3655.64 → 3657.74] this is life is constant PVP.
[3657.74 → 3664.08] Um, and I think sometimes people get lulled into thinking that it's not.
[3664.08 → 3665.94] And that's like actually dangerous.
[3666.26 → 3672.38] Like it's when you're randomly scrolling things, there's a war going on that you're not necessarily
[3672.38 → 3673.40] super aware of.
[3673.40 → 3677.42] And it's trying to learn about you trying to learn about what's going to keep you scrolling,
[3677.42 → 3680.58] trying to learn about what's going to get you to buy something, trying to learn how to
[3680.58 → 3681.82] all those different things.
[3681.92 → 3683.42] It's constantly analyzing.
[3683.54 → 3685.22] It's trying to tune for you need to be aware of that.
[3685.22 → 3690.16] And I like to think that my kids, you know, take me seriously as not just like some, you
[3690.16 → 3693.66] know, okay, boomer, like part of the conversation too, it was actually a bit of a longer chat
[3693.66 → 3697.92] and it was like, look, I'm not, this is not fearmongering.
[3698.62 → 3700.84] I work in this world.
[3700.84 → 3703.86] I live and breathe this world.
[3704.00 → 3710.20] I go to conferences in this world where I look at graphs about this world, about engagement,
[3710.46 → 3710.98] retention.
[3711.58 → 3713.12] That's all they care about.
[3713.54 → 3714.68] You are just a number.
[3715.22 → 3721.82] And I think that's something that people in general, never mind just kids, can't necessarily
[3721.82 → 3724.18] be expected to wrap their brain around.
[3724.30 → 3724.64] Yeah, sure.
[3725.10 → 3725.26] Yeah.
[3725.32 → 3728.88] You are just a number to an organization like Google.
[3730.10 → 3730.90] You're for sale.
[3731.60 → 3732.54] You can be bought.
[3732.72 → 3735.98] You're even just a number to a lot smaller organizations than Google.
[3737.02 → 3737.92] That's fair to say.
[3737.98 → 3740.82] Just because they're at the top of the mountain doesn't mean they're the only ones on the mountain.
[3740.82 → 3741.26] Yeah.
[3744.26 → 3744.58] Yeah.
[3745.42 → 3745.74] Yeah.
[3745.76 → 3746.24] It's pretty wild.
[3748.00 → 3749.58] Langley man says, I'm not a number.
[3750.42 → 3752.06] No, we know you Langley man.
[3752.06 → 3756.38] You're definitely a number to a lot of companies though.
[3756.40 → 3756.74] Yes.
[3758.02 → 3759.46] Which is our point.
[3761.34 → 3763.24] Knap says, are we a number to you guys?
[3763.38 → 3764.10] I think you are.
[3764.16 → 3765.60] I don't think I recognize your username.
[3766.60 → 3767.94] But like Crystal, I know.
[3769.08 → 3771.94] It just, it takes, it takes time to surface.
[3772.26 → 3772.42] Yeah.
[3772.48 → 3774.42] The full point chats a bit smaller of an audience.
[3774.56 → 3778.66] You recognize some people, but you know, it's never going to be everybody.
[3778.82 → 3782.60] You can't, you can't retain like, I don't know, unless you have some crazy brain, you're
[3782.60 → 3785.08] not going to retain all these different names.
[3785.12 → 3786.68] Now they're all asking me if there are numbers.
[3786.80 → 3787.64] How many are asking?
[3788.48 → 3789.34] I mean, get it.
[3789.42 → 3789.74] That's a number.
[3789.74 → 3790.76] Are flow plane users numbered?
[3790.92 → 3791.62] They're probably numbered.
[3791.80 → 3793.30] They're probably numbered in a database somewhere.
[3793.30 → 3793.98] There's customer IDs.
[3794.18 → 3794.36] Yeah.
[3794.48 → 3794.72] Yeah.
[3794.84 → 3795.08] Nice.
[3795.46 → 3796.98] So you're, you're, you're all a number.
[3799.90 → 3802.04] Now they're all fighting over who could be number 69.
[3803.86 → 3807.10] If I'm going to be a number, I'm going to be a cool number.
[3808.82 → 3810.24] I'm going to be the fun number.
[3810.94 → 3817.22] Do you remember, do you remember the, the small amount of politics over employee numbers?
[3817.22 → 3817.58] Oh yeah.
[3817.58 → 3818.96] It was very early in the company for us.
[3819.10 → 3819.36] Yeah.
[3819.90 → 3825.18] Did, did I, did I pull like a power trip and take number one or did I take like 69 or something?
[3825.18 → 3825.66] I'm number one on the health insurance.
[3825.94 → 3827.34] Are you, oh, that's interesting.
[3827.34 → 3830.42] Because I, I think I like, I don't remember.
[3830.52 → 3832.24] Maybe, maybe I'm just, it's been so long.
[3832.40 → 3837.34] One problem that I have is once, once my memory gets past a certain point, I genuinely can't
[3837.34 → 3838.86] tell if I'm just like making it up or not.
[3839.16 → 3839.48] Right.
[3839.96 → 3841.54] Cause like, I don't know if that's a real risk.
[3841.70 → 3842.64] Did I dream this?
[3842.64 → 3848.26] Like, because my brain was like, oh, I like helped set up the health insurance.
[3848.34 → 3849.06] Then I thought about it longer.
[3849.10 → 3850.50] I was like, that sounds really unlikely.
[3850.50 → 3851.86] It was probably entirely Yvonne.
[3851.94 → 3853.06] No, you totally did not do that.
[3853.06 → 3853.28] No.
[3853.36 → 3853.94] I promise you.
[3853.94 → 3855.06] So why would I think that?
[3855.16 → 3855.30] Yeah.
[3855.30 → 3855.70] I don't know.
[3855.92 → 3856.60] I have no idea.
[3856.70 → 3856.82] Yeah.
[3856.82 → 3857.18] I don't know.
[3857.24 → 3859.92] Maybe I like looked into it, but didn't do anything with it.
[3859.98 → 3861.92] I was still on hers for Costco.
[3862.16 → 3862.80] That's probably why.
[3862.98 → 3863.38] That's probably why.
[3863.38 → 3867.06] I was probably still covered as a spouse because then we didn't have to pay extra for it.
[3867.06 → 3871.78] I genuinely feel pretty cool when I'm like going to the dentist, and they're like, what's
[3871.78 → 3872.22] your number?
[3872.32 → 3874.52] And I'm like, uh, one.
[3876.06 → 3876.96] That's pretty cool.
[3877.08 → 3879.46] That's, it's, it's genuinely, that's kind of an alpha mood.
[3879.52 → 3880.00] It's pretty cool.
[3880.02 → 3881.22] I kind of like it, actually.
[3882.78 → 3886.78] I like almost, yeah, I, that's probably my favourite part.
[3886.88 → 3888.30] Do you know your employee number as well?
[3888.36 → 3888.84] Are you two?
[3889.88 → 3895.32] I can't remember if I like, I can't remember if I took one or if I took 69 or if I asked
[3895.32 → 3896.22] to be zero or something.
[3896.22 → 3897.62] I remember talking to Yvonne about it though.
[3897.62 → 3901.46] I think my employee number is like not good because I went to.
[3901.48 → 3903.00] Admitting that he doesn't fill out his timesheet.
[3904.14 → 3905.30] Oh, then I know.
[3905.40 → 3905.86] It's three.
[3906.06 → 3906.42] There you go.
[3906.44 → 3907.04] You're three.
[3907.24 → 3907.48] Yeah.
[3907.74 → 3909.70] I wonder if Yvonne is two then.
[3910.92 → 3912.42] Whatever it is, it's probably wrong.
[3912.52 → 3913.16] I'm calling her now.
[3913.18 → 3914.34] I technically moved to Flow plane.
[3914.78 → 3914.92] Yeah.
[3914.92 → 3915.28] At some point.
[3916.12 → 3918.70] But I think, hey, um, you're live on WAN Show.
[3918.76 → 3919.04] One sec.
[3920.12 → 3920.98] I bet you.
[3921.76 → 3923.40] Uh, hey, I have a question for you.
[3923.86 → 3924.26] Yeah.
[3924.26 → 3926.44] Do you remember my employee number?
[3926.80 → 3932.94] Because I remember I was like kind of bitch about it and I, uh, like I, I wanted a particular
[3932.94 → 3933.88] number or something.
[3935.88 → 3940.50] Um, are you talking about for like our, um, company benefit number?
[3940.66 → 3941.12] No, no, no.
[3941.12 → 3941.92] Not the benefit number.
[3941.94 → 3944.72] Just like our internal database, like our employee numbers.
[3944.72 → 3947.68] Like what we use for Meridian and things like that.
[3947.88 → 3948.64] Uh, yeah.
[3948.76 → 3949.32] You are live.
[3949.50 → 3949.66] Yeah.
[3949.68 → 3954.62] You're live right now, by the way, but just like, just like whatever my employee number
[3954.62 → 3954.94] is.
[3955.26 → 3956.80] I just remember it's not one.
[3957.24 → 3957.96] It's not one.
[3957.96 → 3959.40] Are you, are you one three, three, seven then?
[3959.52 → 3961.96] Because I remember there was a conversation between you and me about that.
[3962.04 → 3964.04] Wait, so it's not one, and I was upset.
[3964.14 → 3965.16] That's all you remember about it.
[3965.16 → 3966.66] Cause that's all I remember about it too.
[3966.74 → 3967.20] So this is.
[3967.26 → 3967.48] Yeah.
[3968.08 → 3968.44] Okay.
[3968.52 → 3969.08] I can check.
[3969.26 → 3971.12] Why aren't I number one or something like that?
[3971.52 → 3971.88] Yeah.
[3971.90 → 3973.24] It sounds like something I would whine about.
[3973.30 → 3973.54] Okay.
[3974.22 → 3974.58] Yeah.
[3974.72 → 3975.04] All right.
[3975.22 → 3975.58] Okay.
[3975.58 → 3976.20] Thanks lady.
[3976.74 → 3977.06] Okay.
[3977.12 → 3977.32] Bye.
[3977.32 → 3977.48] Okay.
[3977.48 → 3977.66] Bye.
[3977.96 → 3978.86] I'm looking it up.
[3979.20 → 3979.76] Oh, what?
[3979.82 → 3980.56] How would you know?
[3980.64 → 3981.36] I have ways.
[3981.56 → 3982.60] What do you mean you have ways?
[3982.62 → 3983.34] Don't worry about it.
[3983.52 → 3984.96] Well, where are you navigating to?
[3985.02 → 3985.78] Don't worry about it.
[3987.52 → 3988.16] Nothing, Dan.
[3988.28 → 3988.98] I get nothing.
[3989.08 → 3989.92] He says he has ways.
[3990.00 → 3990.90] I ask where he's navigating.
[3991.10 → 3992.06] Ah, forget it.
[3992.22 → 3992.80] You are one.
[3992.96 → 3993.52] I am one.
[3993.60 → 3993.82] Yes.
[3994.48 → 3994.72] Oh.
[3994.72 → 3997.94] Why do you have that?
[3998.62 → 3998.94] Oh, you know.
[3998.96 → 4000.28] Why do you have everyone's employee numbers?
[4000.40 → 4001.30] I mean, I guess he's IT.
[4001.50 → 4001.78] Oh, you know.
[4001.78 → 4002.08] He says everything.
[4003.30 → 4003.62] Oh.
[4005.10 → 4005.96] I'm pretty upset.
[4006.54 → 4007.54] I'm 71.
[4008.16 → 4008.44] Oh.
[4009.48 → 4010.32] I was so close.
[4010.74 → 4011.38] So close.
[4014.54 → 4015.26] Oh, man.
[4015.36 → 4015.82] Who's two?
[4015.94 → 4016.86] Oh, I just locked it.
[4016.96 → 4017.08] I don't know.
[4017.30 → 4017.96] Probably him.
[4018.50 → 4018.86] Probably.
[4018.90 → 4019.44] I don't think so.
[4019.54 → 4020.58] Because I went to.
[4020.58 → 4020.78] Okay.
[4020.84 → 4021.26] Unlock it.
[4022.14 → 4023.10] Now we need to know.
[4023.10 → 4025.22] This must be known.
[4025.32 → 4025.86] Who's 69?
[4026.54 → 4026.78] Yeah.
[4026.86 → 4027.42] Who's 69?
[4027.54 → 4028.12] We need to know.
[4028.56 → 4028.78] Okay.
[4028.80 → 4029.10] Hold on.
[4029.98 → 4030.56] What is this?
[4031.44 → 4034.90] Oh, two is, two is no longer here at the company anymore.
[4035.24 → 4035.68] Unfortunately.
[4036.70 → 4038.16] 69 is though.
[4039.44 → 4039.98] Who wins?
[4040.32 → 4041.22] 69 is.
[4041.24 → 4042.18] Oh, that's so sick.
[4042.66 → 4045.10] And it's someone who would really appreciate it.
[4045.18 → 4046.26] He probably would.
[4046.38 → 4047.04] He probably knows.
[4047.10 → 4047.74] He will know.
[4047.74 → 4049.44] Because it's going to be in his stuff, right?
[4049.46 → 4050.32] Yeah, it's probably on his time sheet.
[4050.40 → 4050.56] Yep.
[4050.64 → 4052.56] The one and only Adam Sondergaard.
[4052.56 → 4052.92] Yeah.
[4053.32 → 4054.76] Notice how I'm not even up there.
[4054.86 → 4055.88] I think it's because I got moved.
[4056.04 → 4058.32] You're three for float plane media Inc.
[4058.38 → 4059.02] Which is weird.
[4059.18 → 4060.64] You and Yvonne are probably one or two.
[4060.76 → 4062.08] So you're, yeah, that makes sense.
[4062.18 → 4062.38] Yeah.
[4062.74 → 4063.80] So wait, why is it?
[4063.84 → 4064.44] Why isn't Yvonne?
[4064.96 → 4065.58] No, no, no.
[4065.74 → 4066.26] Wait, what?
[4066.38 → 4067.36] Oh, for float plane.
[4067.84 → 4068.08] Yeah.
[4068.62 → 4071.30] I bet you, you and Yvonne are numbered for float plane.
[4071.78 → 4073.56] Cause if not, it doesn't really make any sense.
[4073.58 → 4074.30] That makes sense.
[4074.38 → 4075.14] That makes sense.
[4075.28 → 4079.68] Cause when we technically made float plane, I think it was literally only AJ and I, like day
[4079.68 → 4080.88] one of actual float plane.
[4080.88 → 4082.18] Maybe Yuki was there.
[4082.28 → 4083.14] I'm not sure.
[4083.38 → 4083.60] Yeah.
[4083.74 → 4084.22] Okay.
[4085.34 → 4086.36] I don't think so.
[4086.40 → 4087.28] There's so many people.
[4087.50 → 4088.22] Oh, Yuki's a contractor.
[4088.36 → 4089.94] This is wild, dude.
[4090.24 → 4090.44] Yeah.
[4090.54 → 4091.32] It's wild.
[4092.38 → 4095.22] Adam and I started very, very same sort of time.
[4096.08 → 4098.24] Absolute, absolute W for Adam.
[4098.42 → 4099.48] What a week for Adam.
[4100.00 → 4100.66] Yeah, I know, right?
[4100.78 → 4101.08] Killing it.
[4101.08 → 4101.82] Amazing employee number.
[4102.20 → 4103.04] Kills the review.
[4103.04 → 4106.26] Got to write his first positive review of a CPU or GPU.
[4106.48 → 4106.96] What a week.
[4107.76 → 4108.60] Oh man.
[4108.74 → 4109.32] That's sick.
[4109.62 → 4111.66] Did we just find out that Adam's just a number?
[4111.82 → 4115.06] Adam is a number, but he's more than a number.
[4115.66 → 4117.08] He's also a word.
[4117.08 → 4117.40] He's a cool number.
[4122.28 → 4123.00] Oh man.
[4125.16 → 4125.96] Based number.
[4126.96 → 4127.32] Okay.
[4127.40 → 4129.94] What are we even supposed to be doing right now, Dan?
[4130.10 → 4134.78] Well, if you don't have many topics, we could do the sponsors, I guess, if you want.
[4136.42 → 4136.82] Okay.
[4137.02 → 4138.12] Have we been live for that long?
[4138.20 → 4139.78] We've got about two hours to go.
[4139.78 → 4139.90] Good Lord.
[4140.74 → 4141.64] Oh my goodness.
[4141.76 → 4141.96] Okay.
[4142.44 → 4145.06] The show is brought to you today by MSI.
[4145.60 → 4150.38] Is your PC so slow and hot that it's basically just a hand warmer this winter?
[4150.46 → 4151.90] What a weird stock image.
[4151.90 → 4158.34] Time to pass the old one to your sibling and upgrade to a baller gaming PC from our sponsor,
[4158.64 → 4159.36] MSI.
[4159.90 → 4165.42] The second generation of their Aegis RS2 AI can come fully loaded with Core Ultra 9 processors
[4165.42 → 4169.74] and an RTX 4090 ready to crush any game you throw at it.
[4170.08 → 4172.36] Luke, you can't groan during our sponsor spots.
[4172.48 → 4174.52] I know they put AI in the name of the product.
[4174.54 → 4174.98] No, no, no.
[4175.06 → 4176.04] I was reading Flow play Chat.
[4176.04 → 4177.44] But you're not allowed to groan.
[4177.50 → 4178.14] I was reading Flow play Chat.
[4178.14 → 4183.30] It also features an MSI Z790 motherboard and liquid cooling with RGB to keep your system
[4183.30 → 4184.86] chilled and all bling.
[4185.26 → 4189.14] You can even customize the lighting with their Mystic Light software to add a festive touch
[4189.14 → 4190.30] this holiday season.
[4190.64 → 4195.70] With built-in Wi-Fi 7, Thunderbolt 4, and PCIe Gen 5, you're set for blazing fast speeds
[4195.70 → 4197.46] and heavy workloads.
[4197.46 → 4207.38] Check out the second generation MSI Aegis RS2 AI at the link in the video description.
[4208.18 → 4211.10] The show is also brought to you by Messi.
[4211.40 → 4214.28] Are your socks as moist as a turkey?
[4215.48 → 4221.02] Our sponsor, Messi, is here to save your feet from dripping gravy at grandma's house this
[4221.02 → 4221.96] holiday season.
[4221.96 → 4222.24] Oh.
[4225.12 → 4227.20] This is great.
[4227.38 → 4228.26] Can I groan during this?
[4228.42 → 4231.72] Genesis 8925 says, I can smell that image.
[4232.12 → 4232.60] Oh.
[4233.64 → 4238.80] Unlike those clunky rubber rain boots, Messi uses Demoted technology to help keep your socks
[4238.80 → 4241.50] dry while staying breathable, lightweight, and stretchy.
[4242.04 → 4246.64] They've got a style for everyone, like the weekend for everyday wear or the storm burst high
[4246.64 → 4248.52] tops for your next big adventure.
[4248.52 → 4252.82] Dennis even brought three pairs of Versus for his family last summer, and they've been
[4252.82 → 4254.18] obsessed ever since.
[4254.84 → 4259.36] In Taiwan, where surprise thunderstorms are a thing, Messi has been a total game changer.
[4259.54 → 4260.04] That's awesome.
[4260.14 → 4264.46] Those are actual, that's hilarious, Dennis, but family, he managed to sneak a family photo
[4264.46 → 4265.80] slideshow into WAN Show.
[4266.62 → 4269.22] Is there anything this mad lad won't do?
[4269.30 → 4270.84] He also got you to say moist.
[4271.24 → 4271.60] Hilarious.
[4272.46 → 4274.14] Want to be the favourite child like Dennis?
[4274.60 → 4278.50] Surprised your loved ones with a pair of Versus this holiday season.
[4279.26 → 4283.80] Check out their shoes at Vessi.com and give the gift of all-in-one style, comfort, and
[4283.80 → 4286.04] versatility with options for under $100.
[4287.24 → 4290.00] Finally, the show is brought to you by Squarespace.
[4290.80 → 4294.88] Coding a website sounds tedious enough, and that's without even mentioning all the copywriting,
[4295.02 → 4295.92] design, and other tasks.
[4296.40 → 4300.06] Do you think Colton is capable of doing all that himself for our website?
[4300.06 → 4305.72] Well, with our sponsor Squarespace, even incapable Colton becomes capable.
[4306.14 → 4310.40] This is so much funnier when you know that Colton is Dennis' direct boss now.
[4310.40 → 4311.12] Yep, yep.
[4311.32 → 4316.82] He just completed a major update to our site, of course, without having to code it for himself.
[4317.40 → 4319.82] Squarespace offers loads of layouts and styling options.
[4319.98 → 4323.28] All you get to do is pick one that fits your needs, and it'll look great on any device.

[4332.88 → 4333.96] Pay, and more.

[4338.46 → 4339.42] a wider audience.
[4339.72 → 4343.70] So start building your website today and get 10% off your first purchase by visiting
[4343.70 → 4346.08] squarespace.com slash when.
[4346.08 → 4347.08] Okay!
[4348.88 → 4350.54] We figured something out with the employee numbers.
[4350.92 → 4351.68] What'd we figure out?
[4352.04 → 4357.60] I am legitimately three, and it has nothing to do with Flow plane, because AJ is 20.
[4359.02 → 4360.64] Oh, so you are three.
[4360.74 → 4361.40] I am just three.
[4361.46 → 4362.10] You're just three.
[4362.22 → 4362.40] Yeah.
[4362.84 → 4363.20] Okay.
[4363.62 → 4364.34] Three's not that cool.
[4364.42 → 4364.82] Real mature.
[4365.00 → 4366.90] But I'm happy with the health insurance one.
[4366.92 → 4367.36] I'll take that.
[4367.44 → 4368.86] Yeah, he's got the one.
[4368.86 → 4369.10] That works for me.
[4369.24 → 4371.10] That actually makes total sense.
[4371.34 → 4371.46] Yep.
[4372.26 → 4372.90] All right.
[4373.02 → 4373.86] You want some merch messages?
[4374.14 → 4374.90] Sure, yeah.
[4374.90 → 4375.34] Yeah.
[4375.54 → 4377.82] Hi, thanks for finally restocking the big case.
[4377.92 → 4379.04] Topics are for codes.
[4380.12 → 4382.04] There's only like half of one left.
[4382.96 → 4384.22] Don't say that about Luke.
[4384.56 → 4385.24] He's nice.
[4387.56 → 4388.56] Thanks for...
[4388.56 → 4393.46] I'm sorry.
[4393.92 → 4394.84] I'm not, but...
[4394.84 → 4396.24] I don't even understand what's happening.
[4396.82 → 4397.38] Thanks for...
[4397.38 → 4398.06] Actually, hold on.
[4398.12 → 4398.36] No, no.
[4398.36 → 4398.64] Wait.
[4398.70 → 4399.18] Hold that thought.
[4399.48 → 4401.30] This is actually a perfect question.
[4402.42 → 4404.10] Jade529 in Flow plane Chat asks,
[4404.10 → 4406.36] why do you have health insurance numbers in Canada?
[4407.00 → 4408.96] Because we have health insurance.
[4409.16 → 4409.32] Yeah.
[4409.64 → 4412.52] It's just that everyone has to pay into it
[4412.52 → 4414.32] in order to keep the deductibles
[4414.32 → 4416.06] and the premiums down for everybody.
[4416.32 → 4416.56] Yeah.
[4418.96 → 4419.36] Cool.
[4419.90 → 4420.30] Medication.
[4421.12 → 4422.82] Medication used to be completely subsidized
[4422.82 → 4423.60] and they pulled that back.
[4424.16 → 4426.20] So you can get even more of it subsidized
[4426.20 → 4427.06] with private health insurance.
[4427.16 → 4428.26] But you don't need it.
[4428.26 → 4429.48] I have...
[4429.48 → 4431.50] This is the first job I've ever had health insurance.
[4432.94 → 4433.34] Yeah.
[4433.86 → 4434.24] Really?
[4434.48 → 4436.74] I've been a contractor my entire working career.
[4436.80 → 4436.82] Oh, yeah.
[4436.82 → 4437.20] That makes sense.
[4437.36 → 4437.56] Yeah.
[4437.96 → 4438.20] Yep.
[4439.20 → 4439.60] Yep.
[4439.68 → 4441.10] No, it's a whole thing.
[4441.34 → 4442.62] Like health insurance...
[4442.62 → 4445.10] Health absolutely costs money here.
[4445.26 → 4447.26] It's just that it's like a more...
[4448.32 → 4449.26] For most people...
[4449.26 → 4450.26] Managed system.
[4450.26 → 4450.80] ...managed system.
[4451.14 → 4453.56] It gets to luckily be somewhat of an afterthought.
[4454.16 → 4454.48] Yes.
[4455.02 → 4455.26] Oh, yeah.
[4455.26 → 4456.04] We don't think about it at all.
[4456.04 → 4456.68] Not everyone.
[4456.80 → 4457.72] No, some people have to.
[4457.92 → 4458.10] Yeah.
[4458.10 → 4460.60] Some people still have health costs that are quite high.
[4460.78 → 4460.92] Yep.
[4462.86 → 4465.06] But even them, as far as my understanding goes,
[4465.14 → 4466.50] they are mostly well taken care of.
[4466.70 → 4470.98] To be clear, there are big downsides to the Canadian system.
[4471.08 → 4471.42] Oh, yeah.
[4471.62 → 4472.02] 100%.
[4472.02 → 4476.08] We are at like a dire, crazy need for more healthcare workers.
[4476.90 → 4480.98] There are some notable lacking points.
[4481.28 → 4481.40] Yep.
[4481.40 → 4485.88] I know people personally who have had cancers advance through stages
[4485.88 → 4488.82] because it took so long to get the appointments that they needed.
[4489.08 → 4492.74] But the flip side is I've never met anyone who just has their bones
[4492.74 → 4494.86] at a bizarre angle because they broke their arm
[4494.86 → 4496.04] and couldn't afford to have it set.
[4496.08 → 4496.44] Yes.
[4496.68 → 4497.02] Yeah.
[4497.58 → 4500.38] Every time I've had something like that,
[4500.76 → 4502.58] some sports injury when I was a kid or something,
[4502.64 → 4503.50] we went to the hospital,
[4503.84 → 4504.96] I got my stuff taken care of,
[4504.96 → 4505.90] and we left.
[4506.36 → 4506.82] And none...
[4506.82 → 4507.06] None.
[4507.06 → 4508.86] There was no credit card machine on the way out.
[4509.00 → 4512.22] None of our health insurer CEOs have been gunned down in the street.
[4512.68 → 4513.12] Yeah.
[4513.52 → 4514.00] Not one.
[4514.24 → 4514.52] Yet.
[4516.64 → 4517.84] And money messages!
[4519.12 → 4520.36] Will you switch cameras?
[4520.76 → 4522.32] He's wearing a Mario costume.
[4524.84 → 4525.32] All right.
[4525.36 → 4526.76] Thanks for finally restocking the big case.
[4526.88 → 4528.54] Luke, how is your Final Fantasy journey going?
[4528.96 → 4529.20] Oh!
[4530.12 → 4531.40] Come on, man!
[4532.52 → 4533.58] Get it together again!
[4533.58 → 4535.14] Why did you ask this week?
[4535.60 → 4536.10] Darn it!
[4536.36 → 4539.84] Okay, so I was approached by a member of the HR team...
[4539.84 → 4540.34] Dan, hold on.
[4540.34 → 4541.46] I don't think my headphones are working.
[4541.54 → 4543.66] All I hear is excuse, excuse, excuse here.
[4544.00 → 4544.50] Oh, yeah.
[4544.50 → 4545.04] It's not an excuse.
[4545.04 → 4546.28] I've got a wine in mine.
[4547.96 → 4548.88] It's not an excuse.
[4549.30 → 4551.06] I was approached by a member of the HR team
[4551.06 → 4553.38] that informed me that starting this coming Monday,
[4553.56 → 4555.78] if I took my mandatory vacation time,
[4555.86 → 4557.74] I would have to take the whole rest of the year off.
[4557.74 → 4558.94] Okay.
[4560.30 → 4561.50] That's not really going to work
[4561.50 → 4563.62] because I have to do things.
[4564.38 → 4565.88] But I am going to take some of it off
[4565.88 → 4567.66] and I don't have any plans.
[4568.32 → 4569.54] So I'm going to beat Final Fantasy
[4569.54 → 4570.84] before the end of the year.
[4570.92 → 4572.00] Final Fantasy VI specifically.
[4572.00 → 4572.24] Yes.
[4572.24 → 4573.78] He's been working on it for...
[4573.78 → 4574.60] Since it came out.
[4577.10 → 4577.64] But yeah.
[4578.00 → 4579.30] What part are you even on?
[4579.42 → 4581.12] Have you advanced at all?
[4581.36 → 4582.56] From the last time we talked about it?
[4582.58 → 4582.78] No.
[4583.02 → 4583.44] Where are you at?
[4583.70 → 4584.16] I forget.
[4584.44 → 4585.80] I can't even remember anymore.
[4585.80 → 4588.26] I'm the main character.
[4588.44 → 4591.56] We went and saw how they were born, essentially.
[4591.84 → 4592.08] Okay.
[4592.44 → 4594.70] And then we have to go fight those dudes.
[4595.02 → 4595.28] Okay.
[4595.36 → 4596.32] Which is kind of how the game works.
[4598.00 → 4598.40] Yeah.
[4598.56 → 4599.08] So yeah.
[4599.16 → 4600.16] I will have time.
[4600.46 → 4601.78] I have no major plans.
[4602.62 → 4603.02] Yet.
[4603.02 → 4606.04] That's not spoilers.
[4606.46 → 4608.60] Obviously, the main character was born at some point.
[4608.68 → 4609.36] That's not a spoiler.
[4609.58 → 4610.14] Oh, come on.
[4610.16 → 4611.74] And fighting dudes in an RPG.
[4611.96 → 4613.20] A spoiler for that game?
[4613.28 → 4614.06] Like, come on.
[4614.28 → 4615.78] Came out in like 1994.
[4616.20 → 4618.20] At a certain point, we have to be able to talk about things.
[4618.34 → 4618.54] Yeah.
[4619.66 → 4620.44] I'll get to it.
[4620.60 → 4622.40] It's like in Jaws, they kill the shark.
[4622.54 → 4623.00] Oh, no.
[4623.14 → 4623.58] Spoilers.
[4623.62 → 4623.90] What?
[4625.50 → 4626.46] I've continued...
[4626.46 → 4627.90] Speaking of ancient content,
[4628.06 → 4630.48] I've been continuing my old movie thing.
[4630.48 → 4632.48] I finally watched Groundhog Day.
[4632.86 → 4633.12] Oh.
[4633.24 → 4634.04] For the first time ever.
[4634.10 → 4634.84] Have you ever seen Groundhog Day?
[4634.84 → 4635.06] No.
[4636.02 → 4639.42] As far as dot-coms go, it's awesome.
[4639.76 → 4640.00] Oh.
[4640.30 → 4640.58] Yeah.
[4641.08 → 4642.60] I'm not a huge Bill Murray guy,
[4642.66 → 4644.88] but maybe part of the problem is I've never watched Groundhog Day
[4644.88 → 4646.12] because he's like super charming,
[4646.34 → 4648.76] and the script is really tight,
[4648.94 → 4653.44] and it's just the pacing of it is really like fun and upbeat.
[4653.64 → 4657.88] Like, I really am not that much of a dot-com guy,
[4657.88 → 4660.04] but it's kind of awesome.
[4660.98 → 4661.18] Yeah.
[4661.48 → 4661.96] Love it.
[4662.22 → 4662.46] Nice.
[4662.76 → 4662.94] Yeah.
[4663.02 → 4666.30] So, and what was great about it was it turned out that in 1985,
[4666.68 → 4668.04] they knew how to make decent movies.
[4668.22 → 4670.04] It's just that The Breakfast Club wasn't one of them.
[4670.80 → 4671.36] That's all.
[4671.86 → 4672.44] Dude, dude.
[4672.46 → 4674.20] You really like poking that nest.
[4674.28 → 4675.20] That little bee's nest.
[4675.22 → 4676.50] It deserves to be poked.
[4677.00 → 4678.08] He ruined my weekend.
[4678.76 → 4679.86] I ruined your weekend.
[4680.04 → 4681.34] How did you ruin your weekend?
[4681.42 → 4682.02] Oh, I get...
[4682.02 → 4682.20] Okay.
[4682.28 → 4682.58] Oh, yeah.
[4682.68 → 4683.60] He made me watch it.
[4683.80 → 4684.48] It was like...
[4684.48 → 4685.66] That ruined your whole weekend?
[4685.66 → 4686.02] Yeah.
[4686.08 → 4687.40] My weekends are very easy to ruin.
[4687.62 → 4689.70] Oh, you got to be less affected by things, my guy.
[4689.70 → 4691.62] Like, everything hurts all the time.
[4692.02 → 4693.10] Well, it's actually spectacular.
[4693.10 → 4695.24] Luke does not let me be hyperbolic ever.
[4695.42 → 4698.90] I wasted a lot of his time on his weekend
[4698.90 → 4702.22] because I wasted whatever time he spent finding The Breakfast Club.
[4702.22 → 4704.60] I wasted whatever time he spent watching it.
[4704.66 → 4707.22] And I wasted whatever time he spent at the end going...
[4708.38 → 4708.52] Oh?
[4710.10 → 4711.44] Sitting crying on the floor.
[4711.58 → 4713.96] So far, I am converting people one at a time
[4713.96 → 4715.74] who watched the movie a long time ago
[4715.74 → 4717.06] and are like, yeah, Breakfast Club.
[4717.18 → 4717.40] Yeah.
[4717.40 → 4721.26] And I'm like, okay, here are all the problems I have with it.
[4721.84 → 4724.74] And so far, I have ruined it for Reese from Logistics
[4724.74 → 4727.78] and Dan already because they've gone back and watched it
[4727.78 → 4728.36] and they're like, yeah.
[4729.36 → 4729.72] Yeah.
[4731.00 → 4733.08] I have no idea what I saw in this before.
[4733.30 → 4735.26] I remember liking little bits of it and stuff,
[4735.34 → 4737.42] but like I came out of it being like, eh.
[4738.18 → 4739.16] The ending especially.
[4739.74 → 4743.18] Well, the ending's like the one part that everybody loves about it.
[4743.18 → 4743.48] Really?
[4744.64 → 4746.30] The start was amazing.
[4746.62 → 4748.68] I thought the setup was actually perfect.
[4748.76 → 4749.64] I was into it.
[4749.70 → 4752.24] 10 out of 10, that was probably the scripted part.
[4752.42 → 4754.52] The main thing that I didn't like...
[4754.52 → 4754.74] God.
[4754.74 → 4754.96] Yeah.
[4755.08 → 4757.42] The character development of the one...
[4757.42 → 4758.48] What character development?
[4759.32 → 4759.70] Oh, no.
[4759.82 → 4762.56] There's one that you wish it didn't happen.
[4762.94 → 4763.34] Oh, yeah.
[4763.46 → 4764.18] Oh, my God.
[4764.24 → 4765.58] So many people wish that didn't happen.
[4765.58 → 4767.68] You mean the girl with the legitimate mental illness
[4767.68 → 4770.04] who puts on some eyeliner and is now acceptable?
[4770.82 → 4771.12] Yeah.
[4771.12 → 4773.92] That one's like, what are we doing?
[4774.36 → 4775.74] What are we talking about here?
[4775.80 → 4776.06] What?
[4776.50 → 4777.38] Avon Fox.
[4777.56 → 4779.78] Are those like conspiracy theories?
[4780.92 → 4781.20] What?
[4781.62 → 4781.94] What?
[4782.20 → 4784.08] Did you realize the whole thing was a dream by Claire
[4784.08 → 4785.52] or the main female character?
[4785.90 → 4786.32] What?
[4788.02 → 4789.02] That is...
[4789.02 → 4789.40] No.
[4789.66 → 4790.66] That's a...
[4790.66 → 4791.68] Yeah, that's...
[4791.68 → 4792.64] Wow, that's a reach.
[4792.78 → 4793.86] I don't think I accept that.
[4793.86 → 4797.00] That's a reach, dude.
[4797.58 → 4797.98] Anyway.
[4798.88 → 4800.32] Anyway, Groundhog Day.
[4800.58 → 4800.96] Excellent.
[4801.50 → 4801.78] So, yeah.
[4802.26 → 4805.26] And, Dan, I have one of the things you recommend.
[4805.34 → 4805.62] Redline?
[4806.42 → 4806.78] Redline?
[4807.56 → 4808.88] That's not even old, though.
[4808.96 → 4809.94] That's from like 2007.
[4810.08 → 4810.74] Oh, God.
[4811.98 → 4812.70] I didn't actually...
[4812.70 → 4814.16] I just thought it was a good movie you should watch.
[4814.20 → 4814.80] I didn't know how old it was.
[4814.80 → 4816.40] That was so long ago.
[4817.00 → 4817.56] Shut up.
[4817.76 → 4818.06] Stop it.
[4818.06 → 4819.18] That was an incredible...
[4819.18 → 4820.10] That was like three years ago.
[4820.10 → 4820.74] Shut up, Luke.
[4820.74 → 4823.90] 1990 was 35 years ago.
[4825.64 → 4826.30] Oh, no.
[4826.36 → 4826.84] Three years.
[4826.98 → 4827.42] Three years.
[4827.62 → 4828.48] I'm still a child.
[4828.52 → 4832.76] Did you know that in a few weeks it will have been a quarter-century since 2000?
[4836.18 → 4838.28] Pentium 2 came out a couple of months ago.
[4838.40 → 4839.14] It's all okay.
[4839.14 → 4840.52] The 1080 is still fresh.
[4840.52 → 4841.86] Technology is cutting edge.
[4841.86 → 4846.62] A quarter of a hundred years after the millennium.
[4847.20 → 4848.66] How does it feel?
[4849.02 → 4850.62] And the iPhone still has bugs.
[4850.62 → 4851.06] How does it feel?
[4851.14 → 4851.36] Yeah.
[4851.36 → 4856.52] PS3 is a retro console.
[4856.88 → 4859.30] That was one that blew my mind a little while ago.
[4859.48 → 4860.08] It's like...
[4860.08 → 4860.64] The Wii.
[4861.00 → 4861.86] It's not just outdated.
[4862.02 → 4862.68] It's retro.
[4863.08 → 4864.32] The Wii is a retro console.
[4864.32 → 4867.36] Dude, how many years ago did the PS4 come out?
[4868.04 → 4870.36] It's not retro, but it's...
[4870.36 → 4871.36] I'm going to get there.
[4871.92 → 4874.58] I'm amazed that anybody knows what your notebook is.
[4875.42 → 4877.70] Dude, the PS4 is so old.
[4878.02 → 4880.10] There's probably people watching this that weren't alive.
[4880.10 → 4881.62] It's 2013.
[4882.30 → 4883.20] Well, yeah.
[4883.54 → 4885.98] I don't know if too many 11-year-olds watch the Wii show.
[4885.98 → 4887.10] I guarantee you there's a couple.
[4887.24 → 4888.46] There's probably a couple.
[4888.80 → 4889.06] Yeah.
[4889.72 → 4891.90] It's like PS4 is like my dad's console.
[4892.10 → 4892.28] Yeah.
[4894.28 → 4895.74] We had that when I was like...
[4895.74 → 4896.04] Uncharted.
[4896.30 → 4896.84] A kid.
[4897.00 → 4897.18] Yeah.
[4897.42 → 4899.46] Oh my God, the nostalgia for...
[4899.46 → 4900.18] Dude, Uncharted is so good.
[4901.30 → 4902.02] Oh, man.
[4902.54 → 4902.98] Jeez.
[4903.16 → 4904.48] Jake's Uncharted 5.
[4904.90 → 4905.44] People are trying...
[4905.44 → 4906.04] Oh, so nostalgic.
[4906.22 → 4907.38] People are trying to mute you.
[4908.00 → 4908.58] Mute me.
[4908.58 → 4910.44] I mean, his voice is so much lower than mine.
[4910.52 → 4912.10] I'm sure that Dan could just put a filter.
[4912.52 → 4912.88] Probably.
[4913.22 → 4913.58] Okay.
[4913.72 → 4915.40] What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[4915.66 → 4917.72] We could do another merch message.
[4917.76 → 4918.04] Sure.
[4918.50 → 4918.98] I don't know.
[4919.50 → 4919.74] Wow.
[4919.82 → 4922.32] Dan's been too busy interacting with the show here.
[4922.88 → 4925.58] And his incomings are...
[4926.58 → 4928.42] It's getting a bit much.
[4929.38 → 4932.36] HR, my boss is laughing about how much work I have to do.
[4932.36 → 4935.68] I don't have to do it.
[4936.58 → 4937.18] That's...
[4937.18 → 4938.86] You're my boss.
[4938.96 → 4940.36] He's not technically wrong.
[4940.46 → 4940.66] Yeah.
[4940.72 → 4942.12] You can tell him he doesn't have to do it.
[4942.12 → 4942.72] It is technically...
[4942.72 → 4943.38] But will you?
[4943.58 → 4945.94] Actually, I should message AJ about that.
[4946.04 → 4946.18] Yeah.
[4946.30 → 4947.74] Does Luke will get angry if I talk to him?
[4948.58 → 4950.08] That is not true!
[4950.90 → 4951.58] Stop it!
[4951.58 → 4954.84] Oh my god, AJ goes, all these people are pissing me off.
[4956.36 → 4957.24] Hi, LLD.
[4957.40 → 4959.10] Great to see the precision screwdriver back.
[4959.10 → 4959.98] That's not what I meant.
[4960.26 → 4961.34] Oh my god.
[4961.36 → 4961.54] Chad.
[4961.74 → 4962.34] That's what he meant.
[4962.84 → 4965.02] Great to see the precision screwdriver back.
[4965.02 → 4965.72] It's up to 80 now.
[4966.38 → 4966.66] Shut.
[4966.92 → 4967.16] Shut.
[4969.30 → 4972.48] The restraint!
[4972.96 → 4975.02] Read it yourself, then.
[4975.32 → 4975.58] Shut.
[4976.46 → 4977.28] Shut the...
[4977.28 → 4977.68] Shut.
[4977.68 → 4977.80] Shut.
[4978.32 → 4979.58] Should I wait for the 50...
[4979.58 → 4980.60] What should I shut, Dan?
[4981.72 → 4982.84] Shut up your face!
[4984.78 → 4987.32] Let's just put some more water in it.
[4987.48 → 4988.16] Let me read this.
[4991.72 → 4992.12] Okay.
[4993.02 → 4993.46] 82.
[4994.78 → 4996.28] HR went home an hour ago.
[4996.36 → 4997.30] I can't do anything.
[4999.10 → 5000.26] Abuse on the weekends.
[5000.50 → 5001.48] It's free game.
[5001.66 → 5002.06] 85.
[5002.06 → 5009.62] I have to do one every 13 seconds for four hours.
[5009.72 → 5010.14] That's great.
[5010.32 → 5011.72] If I read them, I get behind.
[5012.24 → 5014.32] Great to see the precision screwdriver back in stock.
[5014.42 → 5018.44] Should I wait for the 50 series to release before getting the new 4070S?
[5018.84 → 5021.38] Or buy now before Trump tariffs?
[5021.78 → 5023.20] Does the same apply for used?
[5023.84 → 5025.60] That's almost like financial advice.
[5025.76 → 5026.76] It's like, oh god, here I go.
[5026.84 → 5027.14] Okay, fine.
[5027.14 → 5033.06] I think that the incoming administration is actually starting to figure out how tariffs work again.
[5033.26 → 5035.64] I think they may have forgotten because it's been four years.
[5036.76 → 5041.20] I strongly doubt that we're actually going to see...
[5041.20 → 5043.68] The rhetoric has kind of cooled down a little bit.
[5043.78 → 5044.36] Seems like it.
[5044.46 → 5047.74] Now that some reverse rhetoric has started, it's like, hey...
[5047.74 → 5048.68] We will do this.
[5048.72 → 5053.76] We can just actually stop sending energy to Minnesota.
[5053.76 → 5053.96] Minnesota.
[5056.02 → 5057.84] So like, I don't know.
[5058.76 → 5060.86] The inauguration is in like January.
[5061.40 → 5063.10] You might need some energy.
[5064.30 → 5067.80] So now that that's been kind of happening...
[5067.80 → 5076.20] A fascinating side effect of this whole thing has been the re-nationalization of capabilities.
[5076.20 → 5079.12] Like one that came up recently was...
[5079.12 → 5079.86] What was it?
[5082.14 → 5087.04] I don't remember the exact example that I'm trying to bring up.
[5087.12 → 5093.40] But like in this whole sort of sometimes actual, sometimes pseudo trade war that's going on.
[5093.84 → 5101.16] When you stop countries from being able to import things, you know, instead of just not having it, they're learning how to make it.
[5101.16 → 5102.82] But that's happening in the US.
[5102.90 → 5104.88] That's happening in other countries.
[5106.86 → 5111.00] And I think it's going to start backfiring in big ways as we...
[5111.00 → 5115.14] Like when you go like, oh, okay, we don't want you to be capable of this thing.
[5115.24 → 5116.40] So we're not going to give it to you.
[5116.60 → 5119.82] And then they're like, okay, well, now we're not reliant on you for it anymore.
[5119.82 → 5121.02] And we're going to have it anyway.
[5121.80 → 5126.60] And to be clear, I'm not saying that Canada should stop exporting energy to the States.
[5126.60 → 5127.12] Yeah.
[5127.16 → 5130.36] I'm saying that we should have bilateral cooperation.
[5130.62 → 5130.78] Yeah.
[5130.96 → 5132.80] And so we should work together.
[5133.02 → 5134.02] That's a good thing.
[5134.52 → 5135.66] It's good.
[5136.28 → 5136.60] It's good.
[5136.72 → 5137.72] I wonder what the...
[5137.72 → 5138.44] Wow.
[5138.62 → 5139.42] This is probably...
[5139.42 → 5142.16] Do I even want to bring this up?
[5142.16 → 5142.38] Yeah.
[5142.62 → 5142.86] No.
[5143.64 → 5144.12] Water?
[5144.26 → 5145.14] Are we thinking the same thing?
[5145.74 → 5146.02] No.
[5146.22 → 5147.36] What happens if you stop a river?
[5147.58 → 5148.04] Forget it.
[5148.04 → 5150.60] The point is just that...
[5150.60 → 5160.14] The point is that I am hoping, I am more hopeful that between now and January, common sense will prevail.
[5160.62 → 5165.92] And we will not be in a tariff-free trade war immediately.
[5166.46 → 5174.20] And hopefully things won't just go up in price immediately because of no reason other than because we thought it was a good idea.
[5174.20 → 5179.76] I don't know what 50 series is going to look like.
[5179.98 → 5182.58] And if I did, I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[5183.38 → 5189.92] But what I will say is that if you go kind of Google the rumours, it's rumoured to be coming pretty soon.
[5190.58 → 5198.72] And if, you know, Blackwell is anything to go by, like NVIDIA's data centre products, the generational uplift could be pretty good.
[5199.70 → 5201.28] That's all I can really tell you.
[5201.28 → 5217.20] If your price point is like 4070 supervise, based on how NVIDIA has launched previous families and how they've kind of launched the top-end cards to start and then trickled down as they go,
[5217.62 → 5222.38] it may not be that you can get a 50 series immediately at that kind of price point.
[5222.38 → 5231.70] However, once the new family arrives, it's possible that we will see some compression of pricing down below them to make room for the new cards.
[5232.16 → 5237.12] We will also see how they decide to respond or not respond to Intel.
[5237.22 → 5246.52] Given a new family only arrives every couple of years or so now, I would say we're close enough to the rumoured release now that I would probably hold off if I'm looking at a high-end GPU.
[5246.52 → 5251.38] If I'm looking at a low-end GPU, I'm buying an ARC Battle mage right now if I can get my hands on one.
[5251.54 → 5257.00] So, 4070 or so, I'd say you're maybe in the waiting price band.
[5261.50 → 5262.32] Another one?
[5262.64 → 5263.38] Yeah, maybe.
[5264.22 → 5264.44] Sure.
[5264.76 → 5264.98] Sure.
[5264.98 → 5272.36] With AI chips dominating NVIDIA's focus, do you think modern games can adapt to use more of the initial compute from Tensor Cores?
[5272.82 → 5280.16] The B100 has 20-ish times more Tensor Core, Tensor Flops more than standard graphics on a 4090.
[5280.58 → 5285.22] I mean, I think that's what we're seeing in the form of, you know, deep learning super sampling and frame gen.
[5285.32 → 5289.00] We're seeing those Tensor Cores being used in gaming.
[5289.00 → 5295.50] Like, NVIDIA's GeForce division is getting this hardware, and they're kind of going, okay, well, what the crap do we do with this stuff?
[5295.58 → 5305.70] So, I think absolutely we're going to see more AI built right into NVIDIA's products, whether it's in terms of, like, video encoding.
[5305.98 → 5307.50] I wouldn't be surprised by that.
[5307.56 → 5310.72] Whether it's in terms of gamer-friendly features like background noise reduction.
[5310.72 → 5320.74] I don't know that we will just see straight-up compute from Tensor Cores integrated into games, like, in the form of, like, enemy behaviour or anything like that.
[5321.00 → 5322.08] It'd be kind of cool.
[5323.60 → 5325.40] I mean, I'd be kind of into it.
[5325.52 → 5332.12] But, I mean, looking at how, finally, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, we are getting a game that requires RTX.
[5332.62 → 5334.14] And I don't mean that in a bad way.
[5334.22 → 5337.70] I don't mean, like, oh, it requires RTX because developers are lazy or whatever.
[5337.70 → 5346.52] I mean, it's actually fulfilling the promise that NVIDIA gave us back with GeForce 2000 series, where it was going to be a boon to developers.
[5346.52 → 5354.60] Because instead of having to do all these weird tricks and hackery to get lighting to work, they were just going to place light sources and place in-game elements.
[5354.72 → 5356.94] And the light was going to bounce around naturally like it would.
[5357.24 → 5359.36] This is the first game that's actually doing that.
[5359.40 → 5361.82] And we're, what, like, six years on from RTX 2000?
[5361.90 → 5363.26] I forget what the exact timing is.
[5363.26 → 5370.68] So, yeah, we've started to get these AI accelerators on our GPUs.
[5371.06 → 5377.16] But we are still probably a few years away from anyone developing a game that assumes that they will be there.
[5377.20 → 5384.12] And a big part of the reason for that is that while NVIDIA has been baking them into their GPUs for a long time, everyone else was a little slower on the uptake.
[5384.12 → 5391.06] And we're only now getting, like, integrated processors that have AI processing on them, neural processing units.
[5392.02 → 5396.78] So, and I don't know, is there much in the way of neural processing on any of the current-gen consoles?
[5397.40 → 5399.38] Because I don't really think there is.
[5399.48 → 5400.10] I don't think so.
[5400.22 → 5401.52] I don't know a lot about the consoles.
[5401.64 → 5402.02] I could be wrong.
[5402.02 → 5415.26] If we were going to get, like, AI-powered enemy AI, for instance, then I think you'd have to see a console generation that leans heavily into it and that encourages developers to implement it.
[5415.32 → 5418.30] At this point, do you think you would need a handheld that could do it?
[5419.64 → 5419.82] No.
[5420.20 → 5420.96] Not that impactful?
[5421.00 → 5421.54] I don't think so.
[5421.88 → 5427.16] No, I think the TV console still matters enough for at least another generation.
[5427.16 → 5428.16] Interesting.
[5431.66 → 5433.20] Are we doing one more or are we doing topics?
[5434.82 → 5435.82] Yeah, let's do some topics.
[5436.10 → 5436.56] Yeah, why not?
[5436.90 → 5437.18] All right.
[5437.30 → 5437.82] Topic time.
[5437.90 → 5438.78] Hey, do you want to talk about AI?
[5438.98 → 5440.40] There's been some AI stuff this week.
[5440.82 → 5441.18] Sure.
[5441.60 → 5441.80] Sora?
[5442.44 → 5442.78] Yeah.
[5443.12 → 5445.32] Sora is out and there is other AI news.
[5445.44 → 5452.58] OpenAI's 12 days of announcements continued this week with Monday's release of Sora, the AI video generator that blew everyone's minds back in February.
[5452.58 → 5456.60] And they gave it to a couple of people, and then they stopped doing that probably because they realized how expensive it was.
[5457.16 → 5458.16] Put that in myself.
[5458.58 → 5462.24] I definitely thought, this is from Riley, I definitely thought it had been longer.
[5462.40 → 5464.32] Realistic AI video is so normalized.
[5464.72 → 5467.10] That is, yeah, that is very true.
[5467.54 → 5471.54] To the point where I really question a lot of the stuff that I see these days.
[5473.02 → 5473.76] I don't know.
[5473.88 → 5481.78] Anyway, ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers have access, but of course, Marques Brownlee had already been playing with Sora for a few weeks now.
[5482.28 → 5485.34] And then there are some of his examples.
[5485.46 → 5486.00] Are you bringing those up?
[5486.02 → 5486.40] Yeah, I'll bring them up.
[5486.40 → 5486.62] Okay.
[5488.18 → 5498.64] While he brings those up, on Wednesday, OpenAI re-gifted a present in the form of ChatGPT integration in Apple Intelligence, which Apple shipped along with their other AI features this week.
[5498.64 → 5504.82] Most importantly, mail categorization, which is maybe nice and could also lead to you getting in trouble because you didn't respond to anything.
[5504.82 → 5506.00] Wow, it's a fake news report.
[5506.58 → 5507.00] Oh.
[5507.76 → 5508.24] Wow.
[5508.90 → 5510.50] Yeah, the background's definitely not perfect.
[5510.64 → 5511.42] Text is not right.
[5511.42 → 5514.48] But if I wasn't paying careful attention...
[5514.48 → 5514.86] Plot!
[5516.64 → 5517.42] Plot Dog!
[5518.38 → 5519.94] I like the text, personally.
[5520.88 → 5522.26] Oh, do you see the tech reviewer?
[5522.38 → 5523.24] Check out the tech reviewer.
[5523.32 → 5523.60] Yep.
[5523.60 → 5525.70] Open it up.
[5529.26 → 5529.66] Wow.
[5531.66 → 5532.02] Whoa!
[5532.24 → 5533.14] Where'd that phone come from?
[5533.30 → 5533.78] Yeah, yeah.
[5534.08 → 5534.48] Whoa!
[5534.72 → 5535.12] Whoa!
[5535.60 → 5537.12] He's a tech reviewer and a magician.
[5537.12 → 5538.56] I'm a close-up magic expert.
[5538.84 → 5539.16] Yeah.
[5541.74 → 5542.10] Wow.
[5542.10 → 5542.74] That's smooth.
[5542.88 → 5543.92] I mean, now I kind of...
[5543.92 → 5545.00] You know what's funny?
[5545.08 → 5546.32] You want to, like, edit that?
[5546.46 → 5550.40] Dude, we totally have a video coming where I pull that.
[5551.62 → 5556.24] I'm going to go find it in Trello right now while you continue talking about things.
[5556.24 → 5559.00] So, I'm out on screen share for a little bit here.
[5559.00 → 5559.32] Yeah.
[5559.56 → 5567.26] Also, on Wednesday, Google announced Gemini 2.0, which it demoed, powering an updated Project Astra,
[5567.82 → 5570.18] which I'm going to open up really quick.
[5571.74 → 5576.64] Oh, Nicolas Cage says, you should probably look at the news that broke at the top of the show about OpenAI.
[5576.94 → 5577.76] Yeah, I don't...
[5577.76 → 5578.68] What's going on with OpenAI now?
[5578.68 → 5580.52] I don't know if we have that anywhere in the doc.
[5580.82 → 5582.10] I will try to get to that.
[5582.16 → 5585.52] Maybe we'll get through these notes, and then I'll try to see if we can get something on that.
[5585.66 → 5586.14] Okay.
[5586.14 → 5589.66] But it is potentially relatively big news, but we'll have to see.
[5591.52 → 5598.86] There's the Project Astra Assistant with real-time video input, as well as AI agents for gaming and controlling your browser.
[5599.12 → 5601.38] I don't know if I want that, but we'll see.
[5602.02 → 5607.78] OpenAI answered by adding real-time video input to ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode on Thursday.
[5608.36 → 5611.66] Friday's announcement was a nothingburger, just projects in ChatGPT.
[5611.66 → 5618.56] Elsewhere in the AI-verse, Reddit is taking on Google and ChatGPT with Reddit answers.
[5619.46 → 5622.66] Wow, that's actually a great idea.
[5622.98 → 5628.84] A new AI-powered search tool meant to replace adding Reddit to the end of your Google searches, which is a lot of mine.
[5629.26 → 5638.64] A literature class at UCLA is planning to use AI-generated textbooks in 2025, but it's way better than it sounds?
[5638.64 → 5642.70] That's not the sentence that I expected to follow that up.
[5642.96 → 5648.42] The textbooks made by Kudu, a company that collaborated with the course's professor,
[5648.68 → 5656.00] who provided course notes, presentations, and other material from previous iterations of the class to generate the textbook over the course of four months.
[5656.42 → 5661.22] Kudu charges students $25 per semester to access the textbook digitally.
[5661.22 → 5665.90] That's, I mean, it's a lot cheaper than buying some of these textbooks.
[5666.10 → 5666.44] Interesting.
[5666.88 → 5671.58] Providing an alternative to paying through the nose for barely changed new editions of traditional textbooks.
[5673.00 → 5673.36] Interesting.
[5673.68 → 5674.58] That's not that bad.
[5675.00 → 5676.00] Okay, well, I mean, we'll see.
[5676.08 → 5677.28] It depends on how much it hallucinates.
[5677.36 → 5679.72] We'll see how their final exams go, and then we'll evaluate it from there.
[5680.12 → 5684.46] Yeah, build this Agent Orange instead of, you know, a random cleaner.
[5684.46 → 5691.88] AI company Artisan drew criticism for buying billboards through San Francisco that say,
[5692.32 → 5693.74] Stop hiring humans.
[5695.46 → 5697.02] Wow, man.
[5697.58 → 5699.76] Okay, we're going to look at that for a second.
[5700.44 → 5701.60] Are you kidding me?
[5701.64 → 5701.98] Wow.
[5703.14 → 5703.70] Wow.
[5704.84 → 5705.40] Wow.
[5707.20 → 5710.66] I don't know if you heard about this, but something happened to a healthcare CEO recently.
[5710.66 → 5715.66] Anyway, advertising their sales rep AI agents, Artisan CEO Jasper...
[5716.66 → 5717.66] Artisan...
[5717.66 → 5720.50] Say it, Luke.
[5721.76 → 5722.90] Class war.
[5724.42 → 5732.56] The Artisan CEO acknowledged the billboards are somewhat dystopian, but also so is AI.
[5732.82 → 5735.38] And they gave the AI laser eyes?
[5735.50 → 5736.56] What is happening?
[5737.38 → 5738.18] Is this real?
[5738.74 → 5739.38] They did.
[5739.38 → 5741.52] It has laser eyes.
[5742.24 → 5743.38] Yeah, it's creepy.
[5744.10 → 5744.98] What are they doing?
[5746.22 → 5746.70] What is it?
[5747.92 → 5750.26] I don't know, dude.
[5750.60 → 5751.20] I don't know.
[5752.26 → 5753.10] Anyway, yeah.
[5753.18 → 5754.06] Did you...
[5754.06 → 5755.30] You're still looking for that thing.
[5755.38 → 5757.78] Okay, so I'm going to try to pick up an article on this.
[5758.14 → 5761.38] No, I've already got the blog post from...
[5761.38 → 5762.12] I'm so sorry.
[5762.18 → 5762.86] I'm going to try hard.
[5763.18 → 5764.30] Sushi Balaji.
[5764.64 → 5765.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5765.20 → 5769.24] The 26-year-old OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead.
[5769.32 → 5771.20] This is his last post on X.
[5771.20 → 5781.34] I recently participated in a New York Times story about fair use and generative AI and why I'm skeptical that fair use would be a plausible defence for a lot of generative AI products.
[5781.34 → 5785.78] I also wrote a blog post about the nitty-gritty details of fair use and why I believe this.
[5785.78 → 5791.08] To give some context, I was at OpenAI for nearly four years and worked on ChatGPT for the last one and a half of them.
[5791.50 → 5797.48] I initially didn't know much about copyright, fair use, etc., but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against gen AI companies.
[5797.80 → 5810.44] When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defence for a lot of generative AI products for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they're trained on.
[5810.74 → 5813.90] I've written up the more detailed reasons for why I believe this in my post.
[5813.90 → 5821.90] Obviously, I'm not a lawyer, but I still feel like it's important for even non-lawyers to understand the law, both the letter of it and also why it's actually there in the first place.
[5822.44 → 5830.86] That being said, I don't want this to read as a critique of ChatGPT or OpenAI per se, because fair use and generative AI is a much broader issue than any one product or company.
[5831.30 → 5834.78] I highly encourage machine learning researchers to learn more about copyright.
[5835.14 → 5841.18] It's a really important topic, and precedent that's often cited, like Google Books, isn't actually as supportive as it might seem.
[5841.18 → 5845.48] Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to chat about fair use, machine learning, or copyright.
[5845.78 → 5847.54] I think it's a very interesting intersection.
[5847.94 → 5850.00] My email's on my personal website.
[5850.00 → 5862.80] And he actually, he wrote like a little paper on it, on his website.
[5864.68 → 5865.12] Yeah.
[5865.58 → 5867.20] This is the only thing on the website.
[5867.48 → 5876.72] Which is perfect, because yeah, no, fair use is a super, super not a good and stupid defence for training your models with copyrighted works.
[5876.72 → 5885.60] It doesn't, it would fall apart immediately unless you manage to get the case overseen by a completely corrupt court.
[5889.80 → 5890.32] Okay.
[5890.92 → 5891.42] Wow.
[5891.50 → 5893.08] That's, that's really sad.
[5893.08 → 5905.30] What else we got in AI news?
[5905.58 → 5906.94] Did you make it through everything else?
[5906.94 → 5907.72] I think I made it through.
[5908.20 → 5908.54] Okay.
[5908.70 → 5909.74] Well, um.
[5911.40 → 5912.72] You want to hear about other crazy stuff?
[5912.78 → 5914.04] Did you find the thing in the Trello thing?
[5914.14 → 5914.96] I did find the thing.
[5915.10 → 5916.38] Do we want to show that or something?
[5916.60 → 5918.64] So we did a video on ferroelectric RAM.
[5918.64 → 5924.52] Um, and we did like kind of a silly thing in the intro.
[5924.72 → 5925.48] Watch my hand.
[5933.24 → 5933.60] Okay.
[5933.66 → 5934.76] So wait for it, wait for it.
[5937.04 → 5938.20] This is a good video, by the way.
[5939.98 → 5940.50] Hold on.
[5940.56 → 5941.00] Hold on.
[5941.04 → 5941.52] Wait for it.
[5942.58 → 5942.92] Okay.
[5942.98 → 5944.22] So I get this other thing.
[5944.22 → 5944.26] Okay.
[5946.26 → 5946.34] Okay.
[5948.64 → 5949.52] Okay.
[5949.58 → 5950.24] Blah, blah, blah.
[5950.50 → 5951.24] Something, something.
[5952.86 → 5953.26] Radiation.
[5953.40 → 5954.36] It's resistant to that.
[5961.16 → 5961.48] Whoa.
[5961.60 → 5961.86] I don't know.
[5961.90 → 5962.84] We were just on set.
[5963.02 → 5964.40] And I was like, oh, that'd be kind of fun.
[5964.46 → 5969.70] We should just do like a silly, like, uh, I just thought it'd be kind of fun.
[5970.46 → 5971.20] That's pretty sweet.
[5971.20 → 5971.36] Yeah.
[5971.38 → 5976.20] Just the fact that it was so similar to that AI generated video that Marques had.
[5976.40 → 5976.52] Yeah.
[5976.54 → 5977.00] That's cool.
[5977.00 → 5980.08] People are unsure if it's editing magic or magic.
[5980.38 → 5980.86] Who cares?
[5981.78 → 5982.64] That's part of the magic.
[5984.14 → 5987.20] Magician never tells you how they did their trick.
[5987.38 → 5991.54] Speaking of freaking magic, dude, Google announced quantum breakthrough with their willow chip.
[5991.60 → 5992.60] Have you looked at this?
[5993.36 → 5993.70] No.
[5993.90 → 5994.24] You did.
[5994.28 → 5996.20] I linked in the thing early in the week.
[5996.22 → 5996.54] I know.
[5996.74 → 5997.52] I thought you would look at it.
[5997.52 → 5998.84] I've had an incredibly busy week, Luke.
[5998.84 → 5999.76] I had a really busy week.
[6000.50 → 6001.74] I can't use that excuse for fun.
[6001.74 → 6003.08] I used the word incredibly.
[6003.08 → 6006.64] Oh, there it is.
[6006.86 → 6013.68] Google has created a new quantum chip called Willow that can reduce errors exponentially as it scales up.
[6014.12 → 6016.32] A major breakthrough in quantum error correction.
[6016.32 → 6031.26] Willow performed a computation under five minutes that would have taken one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, showcasing its potential for solving complex problems beyond the capabilities of classic computers.
[6031.26 → 6035.18] This is genuinely a new form of compute.
[6035.58 → 6043.28] By all accounts, this seems to be a genuine breakthrough by Google in contrast to their much debated declaration of quantum supremacy back in 2019.
[6043.28 → 6047.54] And maybe they're all it takes is what is it?
[6047.58 → 6051.76] All it takes is attention or whatever that article was that really sparked this whole AI thing.
[6051.80 → 6054.76] And then they weren't on the forefront of it, despite writing the article on it.
[6054.78 → 6059.48] Anyway, however, Google told the verge that their chip won't break modern cryptography.
[6059.48 → 6063.02] So everyone can just chill for now.
[6063.16 → 6063.94] For now.
[6064.72 → 6065.66] Until Willow 2.
[6066.06 → 6066.66] What else we got?
[6066.74 → 6069.74] And then nation states come give us money, please.
[6070.08 → 6071.00] Oh, this is funny.
[6071.00 → 6076.06] Microsoft Recall Preview doesn't honour privacy settings.
[6076.94 → 6084.74] Recall is back in the Windows Insiders program after being pulled in June over lots of backlash, massive privacy concerns, etc.
[6085.00 → 6088.76] The new version allegedly encrypts screens that it captures.
[6088.94 → 6092.32] It's supposed to filter sensitive information and that is enabled by default.
[6092.46 → 6097.36] This prevents it from recording apps, websites, showing credit card numbers, social security numbers and other important financial information.
[6097.36 → 6102.36] Tom's hardware tested Recall and discovered the filter doesn't work very well.
[6102.74 → 6111.04] Credit card info and a random username and password and notepad was captured, despite Capital One Visa being written alongside the information.
[6111.58 → 6116.10] A loan application PDF in Edge was recorded, including social security name and date of birth.
[6116.10 → 6124.28] And they created an HTML page with a web form that said, enter your credit card number below with fields for card type, number, CVC and expiration date.
[6124.48 → 6125.64] And it captured this too.
[6126.24 → 6131.40] It did work for some real world commerce sites that were tested like Moroni and Ada fruit.
[6131.40 → 6136.30] Only the before and after screens were captured, leaving out the credit card information in those cases.
[6136.54 → 6141.14] And when Tom's hardware reached out to Microsoft for a comment, they were directed to a blog post which states,
[6141.14 → 6146.48] we have updated Recall to detect sensitive information like credit card details, passwords and personal identification numbers.
[6146.78 → 6148.90] When detected, Recall won't save or store these snapshots.
[6149.10 → 6155.00] We'll continue to improve this functionality and if you find sensitive information that should be filtered out for your context, language or geography,
[6155.28 → 6156.70] please let us know through the feedback hub.
[6156.88 → 6164.30] We've also provided an option in settings that we encourage you to enable that will anonymously share the apps and sites that you prefer to be excluded from Recall to help us improve our product.
[6167.74 → 6168.14] Nice.
[6168.14 → 6170.04] Hey, at least the new version...
[6170.04 → 6173.18] This is going to be a database of all the smut on the internet.
[6174.60 → 6176.22] I mean, do we need another one?
[6178.04 → 6179.72] Luke, I think that's just called the internet.
[6179.98 → 6180.16] Yeah.
[6181.46 → 6182.46] With Facebook.
[6183.88 → 6187.62] To their credit, the new version is opt-in instead of opt-out.
[6187.82 → 6188.86] Oh, that's a lot better.
[6189.00 → 6193.16] And you need to use Windows Hello to open the Recall app to see what it's recorded.
[6193.62 → 6194.38] That's something.
[6194.50 → 6195.20] That's something.
[6195.20 → 6198.20] Making it opt-in solves most of my problem with it.
[6198.20 → 6198.42] Yes.
[6198.54 → 6199.44] To be completely honest.
[6199.60 → 6206.26] The files are encrypted and could not be easily opened without actually biometrically authenticating or using a PIN.
[6206.66 → 6211.06] So that's the good news, but also, like, you know, yeah.
[6212.02 → 6212.92] Don't turn it on.
[6213.16 → 6214.58] But hey, you can buy a car on Amazon.
[6215.44 → 6220.54] Amazon is launching Amazon Auto with initial partner Hyundai to make buying cars easier than ever.
[6220.72 → 6220.96] Really?
[6220.96 → 6223.10] They have plans to feature other brands in the future.
[6223.22 → 6233.12] You pick your car, trim, options, browse local availability at participating dealers with fixed transparent pricing, get an instant quote on your trade-in, secure financing, check out, and schedule a pickup time.
[6233.88 → 6234.90] Should we do it?
[6236.00 → 6236.18] What?
[6236.30 → 6238.30] Should I buy a Hyundai on Amazon?
[6238.78 → 6239.06] Why?
[6239.36 → 6239.78] I don't know.
[6239.84 → 6240.62] Maybe I want a Hyundai.
[6240.74 → 6241.26] You ever think of that?
[6241.56 → 6243.80] I don't think it's going to be, like, an interesting experience.
[6243.86 → 6244.56] No, I don't think it's going to be.
[6244.56 → 6245.26] I really don't.
[6245.54 → 6245.90] I don't know.
[6246.02 → 6246.98] People are saying yes.
[6247.06 → 6247.60] People want it.
[6247.60 → 6249.40] Yeah, but they're going to say yes to any...
[6249.40 → 6252.18] Hey, do you guys literally 100% of you use Firefox?
[6252.72 → 6255.34] Does literally every single full-plane user use Firefox?
[6255.56 → 6256.08] Is this true?
[6256.16 → 6256.68] You're going to pick up that scab again?
[6256.88 → 6257.50] Is that true?
[6257.82 → 6259.04] What do you guys think?
[6259.34 → 6259.78] Whoa!
[6260.34 → 6261.78] They're saying yes!
[6262.22 → 6262.94] No way!
[6263.34 → 6264.50] That's crazy!
[6264.82 → 6266.04] Imagine that.
[6266.24 → 6267.18] That's wild.
[6267.54 → 6270.58] 100% of an internet user base all using the same type of browser?
[6270.84 → 6271.78] Yeah, you're kind of a dick, right?
[6271.78 → 6272.14] What?
[6277.96 → 6278.32] Okay.
[6278.58 → 6279.28] Two things.
[6279.52 → 6283.86] One, this seems like a kind of weird business decision to me because what was that?
[6283.90 → 6287.74] I thought there was, like, a buy a car online company that popped up during COVID and then
[6287.74 → 6290.62] people realized it, like, wasn't making money at all, and it just super died.
[6291.26 → 6291.60] Probably.
[6291.72 → 6292.16] I don't remember.
[6292.32 → 6295.72] And then also, this isn't the first time you've been able to buy cars on the internet.
[6295.72 → 6295.96] Carvana.
[6296.16 → 6296.68] You could buy...
[6296.68 → 6297.08] Yeah, that.
[6297.26 → 6298.24] You could buy them on eBay.
[6299.44 → 6300.38] That was crazy.
[6300.66 → 6301.08] This...
[6301.08 → 6301.56] I don't know.
[6302.28 → 6306.32] It's just, like, a big box compared to what they normally ship it in.
[6306.50 → 6307.30] I guess it's not a big box.
[6307.82 → 6308.90] How do they drop it off?
[6309.08 → 6310.10] And he knows big boxes.
[6312.44 → 6312.76] No.
[6313.42 → 6314.64] Big box enthusiast.
[6315.20 → 6315.56] No.
[6316.00 → 6316.60] Do you think it's...
[6316.60 → 6317.76] Goes to the big box store.
[6317.92 → 6320.72] Do you think it's an individual, like, flatbed that drops it off?
[6320.84 → 6320.94] I have no idea.
[6320.94 → 6322.02] Do you have to go pick it up somewhere?
[6322.08 → 6323.64] You probably have to still pick it up at, like, a dealership.
[6323.64 → 6324.60] Yeah, because it's local dealers.
[6324.80 → 6325.68] So you still have to go to a dealer.
[6325.68 → 6326.90] Oh, so then, like, what's the point?
[6326.98 → 6329.48] They can still try to sell you some, you know, undercoating.
[6329.48 → 6330.74] Why did we do this?
[6330.74 → 6331.34] I don't know.
[6331.42 → 6332.16] I mean, I didn't.
[6332.68 → 6334.40] Seems like a stupid idea.
[6336.78 → 6340.62] Have LTT and Short Circuit gone too far with the clickbait?
[6342.54 → 6343.44] Have they, Float plane?
[6343.58 → 6344.58] The topic is...
[6344.58 → 6345.80] And this was written up by Elijah.
[6345.92 → 6346.26] Oh, good.
[6347.00 → 6347.64] Yes, folks.
[6347.70 → 6349.32] We did see the Reddit thread titled,
[6349.56 → 6351.20] What Happened to Video Titles?
[6351.20 → 6358.62] And, of course, Float plane says yes, because they just say yes to anything.
[6363.36 → 6364.70] He's so happy right now.
[6364.72 → 6365.98] I'm glad you make him happy.
[6367.38 → 6369.56] Do you enjoy pleasing Luke?
[6370.42 → 6370.78] Whoa.
[6370.78 → 6370.92] Whoa.
[6370.92 → 6371.52] Whoa.
[6376.80 → 6377.20] Yes.
[6377.88 → 6379.54] See, this is what we're dealing with over here.
[6379.66 → 6381.84] This is what we're dealing with.
[6383.04 → 6383.40] Okay.
[6383.58 → 6384.36] Oh, my goodness.
[6386.08 → 6386.80] So the OP...
[6386.80 → 6388.28] What the hell did I walk back into?
[6389.14 → 6390.08] Do you guys need a minute?
[6390.46 → 6392.32] I think it's more like, what did you walk in on?
[6392.48 → 6392.78] Oh.
[6393.26 → 6393.96] I need a minute.
[6393.96 → 6399.04] The OP was expressing some frustration with some of our recent titles being lies.
[6399.50 → 6402.52] Some examples are the most recent AMD upgrade titled,
[6402.92 → 6404.48] Upgrading My Big Brother's Setup.
[6404.86 → 6405.90] You're glad it wasn't your actual...
[6405.90 → 6407.76] And Short Circuit's video titled,
[6408.24 → 6410.14] This is a Weird Shape for a Phone,
[6410.30 → 6413.60] with the OP explaining that the first lines in both of these videos
[6413.60 → 6414.90] had something along the lines of,
[6415.34 → 6416.62] He's not my actual brother,
[6416.86 → 6417.18] or,
[6417.54 → 6418.74] It's not an actual phone.
[6419.34 → 6420.28] Some comments, as well,
[6420.36 → 6423.20] are talking about us lying about renting an Airbnb for the video,
[6423.20 → 6426.52] where we rented an Airbnb and tried to find hidden cameras.
[6427.16 → 6429.46] The reason this is even a WAN topic today
[6429.46 → 6431.60] is because we would like to discuss with the community
[6431.60 → 6434.14] why our titles are the way that they are,
[6434.56 → 6439.24] and talk about how even if a fringe minority is upset about the titles,
[6439.66 → 6443.20] we as a business are always experimenting and seeing what sticks and what doesn't.
[6444.32 → 6445.10] Elijah says,
[6445.20 → 6447.46] Because believe me, if it doesn't stick, we adjust it.
[6447.62 → 6450.20] EX, the Mac for poor people title.
[6453.20 → 6456.00] How that made it out the door, man.
[6456.16 → 6457.08] I approved it.
[6457.46 → 6457.72] What?
[6457.88 → 6458.66] I'm like, oh, man.
[6458.76 → 6459.78] I thought it was funny.
[6460.14 → 6460.62] Oh.
[6460.92 → 6462.78] I saw one of the community posts about that,
[6462.82 → 6463.28] and I was like,
[6463.40 → 6464.00] that's fake.
[6464.26 → 6464.88] I can tell...
[6464.88 → 6466.10] That wasn't use.
[6466.20 → 6467.24] And then I'm like,
[6467.32 → 6467.90] oh, man, like,
[6468.22 → 6469.40] that's crazy.
[6469.58 → 6471.42] And then I was reading the comments,
[6471.50 → 6471.70] and I was like,
[6471.80 → 6472.00] no.
[6472.00 → 6476.10] I can tell you the context that existed in my brain
[6476.10 → 6478.48] that made it so that I thought that was a funny title.
[6478.96 → 6481.72] Because I've been trying to make a video called...
[6481.72 → 6482.96] The background was tense.
[6483.14 → 6483.50] Hold on.
[6483.68 → 6485.12] Okay, I didn't notice that.
[6485.12 → 6485.60] Oh, yeah.
[6485.74 → 6486.64] That was bad.
[6487.04 → 6488.42] I did not notice that.
[6488.52 → 6489.70] I would not have...
[6489.70 → 6490.48] I didn't notice that.
[6490.84 → 6494.18] But the background that existed in my brain for why we made the decision
[6494.18 → 6497.84] was that I've been trying to convince the writing team to make a video
[6497.84 → 6498.94] that's like,
[6499.48 → 6503.26] brand X doesn't care about poor people for a long time.
[6503.62 → 6507.36] Because so many brands have abandoned their low-end products.
[6508.04 → 6512.48] We no longer have, like, a current-gen $130 CPU.
[6512.68 → 6513.56] This was not the way.
[6513.96 → 6517.08] We no longer have a current-gen $250 GPU,
[6517.20 → 6518.18] at least until Thursday.
[6518.76 → 6519.24] And so,
[6519.62 → 6520.64] I was like,
[6521.38 → 6521.88] Apple,
[6521.88 → 6525.56] who has completely forgotten about poor people.
[6526.32 → 6526.76] Forever.
[6526.98 → 6529.56] I mean, when's the last time they even made an iPhone SE?
[6530.36 → 6531.40] Like, honestly.
[6532.16 → 6532.92] iPhone...
[6532.92 → 6534.18] So, that was my whole thing.
[6534.78 → 6536.18] Apple finally, like,
[6536.66 → 6538.44] remembered not everybody has
[6538.44 → 6541.56] $1,300 to spend on a phone.
[6542.14 → 6542.90] And, like,
[6543.04 → 6545.18] a $1,500 to spend on a computer.
[6545.90 → 6546.32] That was where I was...
[6546.32 → 6546.84] A headphone jack-out,
[6546.90 → 6547.72] so we can't have our, like,
[6547.78 → 6549.44] genuinely, decently affordable headphones either.
[6549.62 → 6551.66] That was where I was coming from.
[6552.20 → 6554.88] Finally, Apple made a computer for poor people.
[6555.46 → 6558.48] They, like, remembered that not everybody is a dentist.
[6559.42 → 6560.64] And, yeah, it didn't land.
[6560.90 → 6561.46] It didn't land.
[6561.56 → 6561.78] Anyway.
[6562.14 → 6562.48] No.
[6563.48 → 6565.26] There are some discussion questions here,
[6565.36 → 6565.88] but first,
[6565.98 → 6569.06] I would like to correct a couple of misconceptions.
[6569.60 → 6572.32] The first one that really got people mad
[6572.32 → 6573.56] was the Airbnb one.
[6574.56 → 6575.24] Okay.
[6575.24 → 6579.52] And that's the one that I actually most take exception to.
[6579.94 → 6581.52] Because in that video,
[6581.74 → 6584.28] let's have a look at what this title was.
[6584.88 → 6585.06] Okay.
[6585.10 → 6585.42] Hold on.
[6585.46 → 6586.08] Where are we at?
[6586.16 → 6586.44] Okay.
[6586.78 → 6587.34] Here we go.
[6587.64 → 6588.46] Here's the title.
[6589.18 → 6589.94] Here's the thumbnail.
[6590.62 → 6592.72] I rented an Airbnb
[6592.72 → 6595.26] to look for hidden cameras.
[6595.78 → 6596.18] Okay.
[6596.62 → 6597.46] There's our...
[6597.46 → 6598.36] Here's our thumbnail.
[6599.04 → 6601.12] Device finds cameras.
[6601.98 → 6602.24] Okay.
[6602.84 → 6604.12] I rented an Airbnb.
[6605.16 → 6605.92] I did.
[6606.24 → 6609.32] We shot this video in an Airbnb that we rented.
[6609.54 → 6609.86] Really?
[6610.18 → 6610.54] Really.
[6610.54 → 6612.82] Step two.
[6613.44 → 6614.98] I looked for hidden...
[6614.98 → 6615.20] He's not going to lie.
[6615.26 → 6615.82] When I watched it,
[6615.82 → 6616.02] I was like,
[6616.06 → 6616.84] that's not his house.
[6617.34 → 6617.96] Step two.
[6617.96 → 6618.80] And I believed you rented one.
[6619.08 → 6620.98] I looked for hidden cameras.
[6621.88 → 6622.56] I did.
[6622.86 → 6623.60] You just didn't find it?
[6624.06 → 6625.20] Well, yeah, obviously not.
[6625.26 → 6626.22] Because, like...
[6626.22 → 6627.22] They're almost nowhere.
[6627.28 → 6628.52] We had to ask for permission
[6628.52 → 6630.36] to use the place as a filming location,
[6630.50 → 6631.14] yet empties.
[6631.62 → 6633.06] And no one's going to be...
[6633.06 → 6634.60] We had to tell them what we were doing.
[6635.36 → 6635.72] Yeah.
[6636.70 → 6637.38] That's fair.
[6637.54 → 6638.02] And, like,
[6638.12 → 6639.38] some people were like,
[6639.38 → 6640.04] well, you should have, like,
[6640.08 → 6641.32] rented a bunch of Airbnb's
[6641.32 → 6641.94] and searched them all.
[6642.02 → 6642.10] It's like,
[6642.26 → 6644.36] the vast majority are not going to have
[6644.36 → 6645.70] any hidden electronics in them.
[6646.20 → 6647.58] I'm sure it's a thing
[6647.58 → 6648.56] that technically happens,
[6648.68 → 6650.10] but actually finding one,
[6650.18 → 6650.68] like, there's...
[6650.68 → 6651.64] I literally
[6651.64 → 6653.60] rented an Airbnb
[6653.60 → 6655.82] to look for hidden cameras.
[6655.88 → 6657.28] What the f*** do you want from me?
[6658.92 → 6659.36] And,
[6659.50 → 6660.86] to show you the importance
[6660.86 → 6662.12] of titling on YouTube,
[6662.78 → 6665.28] this is how this video was performing
[6665.28 → 6667.78] when we had the initial title.
[6668.04 → 6668.56] What was it?
[6669.38 → 6670.78] I think it was
[6670.78 → 6672.56] this device
[6672.56 → 6673.40] can detect
[6673.40 → 6674.54] any electronics
[6674.54 → 6675.34] even when they're off.
[6675.38 → 6675.56] Oh, yeah.
[6675.62 → 6676.34] The new title's way better.
[6676.50 → 6678.34] Which was a super straightforward
[6678.34 → 6679.84] straight shooter title.
[6680.04 → 6680.22] Yep.
[6680.82 → 6681.26] Then,
[6681.46 → 6682.48] we changed
[6682.48 → 6683.52] the title of the video.
[6683.66 → 6684.88] I forget exactly where.
[6684.98 → 6685.64] We log it somewhere.
[6685.82 → 6686.18] And it went,
[6686.54 → 6687.58] showoff!
[6689.02 → 6689.98] Went from being
[6689.98 → 6691.46] a horrible
[6691.46 → 6692.58] underperformer,
[6692.72 → 6692.92] like,
[6692.98 → 6693.56] the worst thing
[6693.56 → 6694.02] we'd uploaded
[6694.02 → 6694.96] in a couple of weeks,
[6695.16 → 6696.00] to being an
[6696.00 → 6697.02] overperformer.
[6697.02 → 6697.98] So,
[6698.42 → 6699.42] you know what?
[6699.72 → 6700.14] Yeah.
[6700.80 → 6702.00] If my title is
[6702.00 → 6703.30] literally accurate,
[6704.48 → 6705.36] and you're just like,
[6705.56 → 6706.74] you're just like mad
[6706.74 → 6708.36] because we didn't
[6708.36 → 6709.98] find a camera
[6709.98 → 6710.94] that we didn't put that,
[6711.00 → 6711.16] like,
[6711.20 → 6711.66] I'm sorry,
[6711.72 → 6712.90] it was a perfect video.
[6713.04 → 6713.08] Because,
[6713.08 → 6713.32] guys,
[6713.48 → 6714.94] if they didn't actually
[6714.94 → 6715.56] rent an Airbnb,
[6715.88 → 6717.04] I don't think they would have been,
[6717.04 → 6720.24] I think they would have been
[6720.24 → 6721.66] lazy enough to just use,
[6721.72 → 6721.92] like,
[6721.98 → 6722.74] the kitchen set
[6722.74 → 6723.44] or your house.
[6724.00 → 6724.60] I don't think they would have
[6724.60 → 6726.66] gone to painstakingly convince you
[6726.66 → 6727.20] that it's a
[6727.20 → 6728.42] different house,
[6728.58 → 6730.12] but not actually pay for an Airbnb.
[6730.14 → 6730.28] Dude,
[6730.28 → 6731.08] we drove all the way to,
[6731.18 → 6731.28] like,
[6731.34 → 6732.18] Abbotsford or something.
[6732.32 → 6732.42] Like,
[6732.46 → 6732.84] we actually,
[6732.92 → 6733.10] like,
[6733.52 → 6734.50] rented an Airbnb
[6734.50 → 6735.90] and went to an Airbnb
[6735.90 → 6737.04] and shot in an Airbnb.
[6737.30 → 6738.12] We put in the work
[6738.12 → 6739.00] for crying out loud.
[6739.50 → 6740.06] And then,
[6740.14 → 6741.48] the funny thing about it to me
[6741.48 → 6742.00] is that,
[6742.08 → 6743.58] other than that Reddit thread,
[6743.58 → 6746.14] almost no one
[6746.14 → 6747.10] was mad about
[6747.10 → 6748.58] the very next day
[6748.58 → 6750.06] us uploading the video
[6750.06 → 6751.06] with Lucas
[6751.06 → 6752.22] where it was like,
[6752.28 → 6753.48] upgrading my big brother's setup,
[6753.58 → 6753.78] okay,
[6753.84 → 6755.06] he's not actually my brother.
[6755.44 → 6756.88] That was a good joke.
[6757.08 → 6757.86] It was just,
[6758.44 → 6759.36] guys,
[6759.48 → 6760.22] he's joke.
[6760.56 → 6761.14] He's joke,
[6761.20 → 6761.48] OP.
[6761.74 → 6763.20] Are people actually upset
[6763.20 → 6763.58] about the brother thing?
[6763.58 → 6763.74] No,
[6763.74 → 6764.48] it's just the one guy.
[6764.62 → 6764.92] Okay.
[6766.36 → 6767.00] And then,
[6767.10 → 6767.36] as for,
[6767.42 → 6768.10] what was the other one?
[6768.30 → 6769.66] The weird shape for a phone.
[6769.90 → 6770.08] Yeah,
[6770.12 → 6770.86] so with the phone one,
[6771.24 → 6772.78] the only reason that I called it,
[6772.82 → 6772.96] like,
[6772.96 → 6774.04] a weird shape for a phone
[6774.04 → 6774.54] was because
[6774.54 → 6775.40] it's not a phone.
[6775.46 → 6776.24] It doesn't have a SIM slot.
[6776.30 → 6777.08] And I acknowledge that
[6777.08 → 6777.98] first line of the video
[6777.98 → 6778.54] because,
[6778.86 → 6779.02] like,
[6779.08 → 6779.64] like they said.
[6780.18 → 6781.56] But what it does have
[6781.56 → 6783.40] is it has a Snapdragon processor
[6783.40 → 6784.78] that is very similar
[6784.78 → 6786.08] in performance and capabilities
[6786.08 → 6787.40] to a modern smartphone.
[6787.70 → 6789.54] And that's why it's so expensive.
[6789.54 → 6792.06] It's like a $600 Game Boy thing.
[6793.72 → 6794.56] But it's like,
[6794.80 → 6795.72] it's got a touchscreen
[6795.72 → 6797.52] and runs like full-fat Android
[6797.52 → 6798.66] even though it,
[6799.58 → 6800.42] like,
[6800.48 → 6801.76] has a Game Boy interface
[6801.76 → 6803.48] that honestly kind of blows.
[6803.62 → 6803.72] Like,
[6803.76 → 6804.44] the form factors,
[6804.94 → 6805.08] like,
[6805.14 → 6805.98] there's a reason nobody
[6805.98 → 6807.42] makes the Game Boy anymore
[6807.42 → 6808.50] other than people
[6808.50 → 6809.70] who still make the Game Boy.
[6810.50 → 6811.08] Which are a few.
[6811.20 → 6812.66] Which there are a handful doing,
[6812.76 → 6813.72] but it's not ergonomic.
[6813.88 → 6814.06] It's,
[6814.12 → 6814.40] it's,
[6814.40 → 6815.74] it's a very old,
[6815.88 → 6816.44] very dated,
[6816.62 → 6818.28] very not ergonomic design.
[6818.44 → 6818.64] Yeah.
[6818.64 → 6819.84] And so I just,
[6819.92 → 6820.84] I just thought it was,
[6820.96 → 6821.82] I just thought it was amusing.
[6821.94 → 6823.68] I think that is probably
[6823.68 → 6826.72] the most sort of valid complaint
[6826.72 → 6828.00] where people were actually mad
[6828.00 → 6829.70] and it was actually kind of misleading.
[6829.78 → 6830.30] And I'm sorry,
[6830.38 → 6830.98] and we fixed it.
[6831.50 → 6832.08] But yeah,
[6832.14 → 6832.36] we're,
[6832.56 → 6833.50] we're always trying stuff
[6833.50 → 6834.28] because we never know
[6834.28 → 6835.00] what's going to work.
[6835.36 → 6835.82] And the
[6835.90 → 6836.06] the
[6836.06 → 6836.36] the
[6836.36 → 6837.20] ideating on titles
[6837.20 → 6839.36] is also incredibly freaking hard.
[6839.36 → 6840.58] And I think people don't realize that.
[6840.60 → 6841.30] And it's frustrating
[6841.30 → 6843.14] because when we name something
[6843.14 → 6844.18] like that,
[6844.18 → 6847.02] that nonlinear junction detector video,
[6847.02 → 6848.32] when we name something,
[6848.42 → 6849.32] literally what it is
[6849.32 → 6850.12] or what it does,
[6850.24 → 6852.96] it performs like crap.
[6853.46 → 6854.46] Nobody watches it.
[6854.54 → 6855.62] It's a great video.
[6855.74 → 6857.12] It's educational.
[6857.36 → 6858.34] It's entertaining.
[6858.86 → 6860.34] It's a good length.
[6860.36 → 6861.06] It's very like,
[6861.12 → 6862.88] just like eat some popcorn watchable,
[6862.88 → 6864.44] like for crying out loud.
[6865.26 → 6866.24] I don't know guys.
[6866.30 → 6866.52] I'm just,
[6866.60 → 6867.22] I'm not gonna,
[6867.42 → 6868.44] I'm not going to apologize
[6868.44 → 6871.18] for having to put good content
[6871.18 → 6873.46] in shiny packaging.
[6874.66 → 6875.00] Um,
[6875.12 → 6875.66] and yeah,
[6875.66 → 6876.22] like we're,
[6876.34 → 6877.66] we're gonna,
[6877.88 → 6878.94] we're going to fly too close
[6878.94 → 6879.78] to the sun sometimes
[6879.78 → 6880.72] and we're going to have to
[6880.72 → 6881.82] sort of correct titles
[6881.82 → 6882.98] or we'll just have a
[6883.36 → 6884.34] or we'll upload a
[6884.54 → 6885.26] or we'll have like
[6885.26 → 6886.02] a straight shooter title
[6886.02 → 6886.90] that we're going to have to,
[6886.90 → 6887.34] you know,
[6887.40 → 6888.40] lean farther into,
[6888.66 → 6890.16] into making it more clickable.
[6890.16 → 6892.26] But it's just part of the game
[6892.26 → 6893.28] and it's frustrating to me
[6893.28 → 6894.96] because I wish I could just call the video
[6894.96 → 6896.72] nonlinear junction detectors explained.
[6896.82 → 6897.66] These things are so cool
[6897.66 → 6898.20] because that,
[6898.38 → 6899.38] that's what I felt about it.
[6899.40 → 6900.50] That's what I wanted to call it.
[6900.54 → 6900.70] That's,
[6900.70 → 6901.76] I was the one who came up
[6901.76 → 6902.70] with the title that was like,
[6902.74 → 6904.26] this detects any electronics
[6904.26 → 6905.14] even if they're off.
[6906.00 → 6907.10] But nobody clicked it
[6907.10 → 6907.98] or detects hidden,
[6908.08 → 6909.16] hidden spy devices
[6909.16 → 6909.84] even if they're off
[6909.84 → 6910.44] or something like that.
[6910.46 → 6911.14] I forget what it was,
[6911.20 → 6911.32] but.
[6911.92 → 6913.08] I watched the
[6913.20 → 6915.16] the video.
[6915.40 → 6916.96] I think I might've clicked on it
[6916.96 → 6918.70] before the title update.
[6920.28 → 6920.68] Um,
[6920.74 → 6921.80] because I was interested
[6921.80 → 6923.30] in how it found electronics
[6923.30 → 6924.06] when they were off.
[6924.16 → 6925.54] And if that was in the first title,
[6925.60 → 6925.76] that,
[6925.92 → 6927.18] that's probably why I clicked on it.
[6927.44 → 6927.84] So that's,
[6927.88 → 6928.62] that's another thing is like
[6928.62 → 6930.28] you might get a different type of person
[6930.28 → 6931.66] but the type of people
[6931.66 → 6932.74] that want that first title
[6932.74 → 6934.56] just aren't as common.
[6935.28 → 6936.94] So the video will perform worse.
[6937.20 → 6937.78] I wish we,
[6937.88 → 6940.18] I wish we could ABC titles as well.
[6940.72 → 6942.10] Or pairings of titles
[6942.10 → 6942.58] and thumbnails
[6942.58 → 6943.34] and stuff like that
[6943.34 → 6944.72] and not even lock into one
[6944.72 → 6946.12] but just have them be different
[6946.12 → 6946.84] depending on,
[6947.06 → 6947.82] you know,
[6947.88 → 6949.16] what YouTube knows
[6949.16 → 6950.24] you're more likely to click on.
[6950.40 → 6950.62] Like,
[6950.64 → 6951.58] I'd be super down for that.
[6951.96 → 6952.68] It's a matter of time.
[6952.76 → 6952.88] Yeah,
[6952.88 → 6953.82] I was just thinking like,
[6953.88 → 6955.04] what if you had like,
[6955.04 → 6956.80] five different title
[6956.80 → 6957.54] and thumbnail mixes
[6957.54 → 6958.34] for one video
[6958.34 → 6959.34] and it just served
[6959.34 → 6960.38] what it thought
[6960.38 → 6961.98] that user would like the most
[6961.98 → 6963.08] to the individual user
[6963.08 → 6964.20] instead of A-B testing.
[6966.60 → 6967.00] Sorry,
[6967.04 → 6967.78] I wasn't really listening
[6967.78 → 6968.88] but the Airbnb thing
[6968.88 → 6969.60] says it was apparently
[6969.60 → 6970.50] actually kind of pain
[6970.50 → 6971.10] because accounting
[6971.10 → 6972.16] was all over it.
[6973.74 → 6974.14] Oh,
[6974.18 → 6974.92] that's hilarious.
[6975.42 → 6975.58] Uh,
[6975.58 → 6975.84] anyway,
[6975.96 → 6976.94] Elijah says,
[6977.00 → 6977.28] uh,
[6977.28 → 6978.22] this is my thoughts
[6978.22 → 6978.98] on the whole thing
[6978.98 → 6980.50] and linked to a Reddit post.
[6980.50 → 6982.22] Is it his Reddit post?
[6983.18 → 6983.38] Oh,
[6983.70 → 6984.18] Elijah.
[6986.74 → 6987.10] Okay,
[6987.26 → 6988.22] one of our rules
[6988.22 → 6989.12] in the writing department
[6989.12 → 6990.42] is don't insult the audience
[6990.42 → 6991.28] and I know I break it
[6991.28 → 6991.80] once in a while
[6991.80 → 6992.76] but that doesn't mean you can.
[6993.56 → 6993.84] Uh,
[6993.90 → 6994.16] okay.
[6995.94 → 6996.70] What are we supposed
[6996.70 → 6997.28] to be talking about?
[6997.80 → 6997.98] No,
[6998.04 → 6998.28] it's not.
[6998.34 → 6998.88] Apparently it's not
[6998.88 → 6999.56] his Reddit post.
[6999.82 → 7000.02] No,
[7000.08 → 7000.52] it wasn't.
[7000.56 → 7001.50] It was someone
[7001.50 → 7002.32] being very rude.
[7002.94 → 7003.26] Oh.
[7003.38 → 7004.38] I know it's not yours,
[7004.38 → 7004.70] Elijah,
[7004.80 → 7005.70] but you linked it.
[7006.02 → 7006.66] I like the title
[7006.66 → 7007.40] at the very least.
[7008.02 → 7008.14] What?
[7008.92 → 7009.14] No,
[7009.52 → 7011.22] it's this one.
[7012.78 → 7013.14] No,
[7013.22 → 7013.70] I think he,
[7013.80 → 7014.08] no.
[7015.06 → 7015.28] No,
[7015.34 → 7015.90] I think he linked the thread.
[7015.90 → 7015.92] Oh,
[7015.94 → 7016.48] I thought it was
[7016.48 → 7017.48] the top response
[7017.48 → 7018.12] that he linked.
[7018.58 → 7018.82] No.
[7019.08 → 7019.28] Okay,
[7019.32 → 7019.54] fine.
[7019.82 → 7020.02] Yeah,
[7020.02 → 7020.30] it's fine.
[7020.78 → 7021.14] Okay.
[7021.30 → 7022.08] Put down your keyboards
[7022.08 → 7023.12] and just enjoy the content.
[7023.28 → 7023.32] There,
[7023.32 → 7023.50] there.
[7023.68 → 7024.18] We don't look at
[7024.18 → 7025.26] the top response.
[7025.34 → 7025.52] Yeah,
[7025.68 → 7025.90] okay.
[7027.34 → 7028.04] I got you,
[7028.12 → 7028.28] Elijah,
[7028.34 → 7028.74] you're good.
[7029.06 → 7029.26] Okay,
[7029.32 → 7029.54] we're good.
[7029.78 → 7030.14] Yeah,
[7030.22 → 7030.36] yeah,
[7030.36 → 7030.82] we can go back.
[7030.92 → 7031.08] Okay,
[7031.26 → 7031.42] yeah,
[7031.44 → 7031.72] we're good.
[7031.82 → 7031.98] Thanks,
[7032.04 → 7032.22] Elijah.
[7033.44 → 7033.84] Blu-rays.
[7034.98 → 7035.26] Dude,
[7035.50 → 7037.82] LG has discontinued
[7037.82 → 7038.50] their Blu-ray
[7038.50 → 7040.36] and UHD Blu-ray players.
[7040.66 → 7041.62] This has been confirmed
[7041.62 → 7042.76] by Flat Panels HD.
[7043.46 → 7044.06] LG Korea,
[7044.36 → 7044.88] excuse me,
[7044.94 → 7045.58] didn't confirm
[7045.58 → 7046.56] if this is a definitive
[7046.56 → 7047.62] and final exit
[7047.62 → 7049.00] from the optical disc player market,
[7049.20 → 7050.74] so this could leave the door open
[7050.74 → 7051.86] in case they want to make a return,
[7052.18 → 7052.94] but they haven't made
[7052.94 → 7053.88] any new models
[7053.88 → 7054.66] of Blu-ray players
[7054.66 → 7055.60] since 2018,
[7056.36 → 7057.38] and it's no secret
[7057.38 → 7058.72] that sales of Blu-ray discs
[7058.72 → 7059.22] and players
[7059.22 → 7060.30] are on a very steep
[7060.30 → 7062.04] and steady decline.
[7062.54 → 7064.38] And our discussion question here is,
[7064.64 → 7065.48] physical media,
[7065.68 → 7066.84] especially for movies,
[7067.00 → 7068.24] is seen as far superior
[7068.24 → 7070.24] to streaming due to factors
[7071.32 → 7072.28] like higher bit rate
[7072.28 → 7073.48] and less compression.
[7075.80 → 7076.56] What are we,
[7076.66 → 7079.32] are we just not going to have
[7079.32 → 7082.00] like a definitive quality version
[7082.00 → 7083.46] of new films anymore?
[7083.70 → 7084.22] I think so.
[7084.76 → 7085.46] Will streaming,
[7086.38 → 7087.62] will we see a high quality
[7087.62 → 7088.48] streaming service
[7088.48 → 7089.34] that comes in
[7089.34 → 7090.12] to take the place?
[7090.58 → 7091.36] I don't think so either.
[7092.08 → 7092.84] People won't pay for it.
[7093.06 → 7093.78] And if they do,
[7093.90 → 7095.00] one person will pay for it,
[7095.04 → 7095.50] they'll rip it,
[7095.50 → 7096.20] and then everyone else
[7096.20 → 7096.86] will just download it
[7096.86 → 7097.76] kind of like with Blu-rays.
[7099.80 → 7100.16] Okay,
[7100.26 → 7101.00] this ended up being
[7101.00 → 7102.10] less of a main news topic
[7102.10 → 7103.64] and more of a short conversation,
[7103.90 → 7104.30] but anyway,
[7104.36 → 7105.24] that's a thing that happened,
[7105.46 → 7106.64] which is a bummer
[7106.64 → 7107.10] because yeah,
[7107.18 → 7107.82] Blu-ray versions
[7107.82 → 7110.02] are like definitely better
[7110.02 → 7110.52] and look way better
[7110.52 → 7112.66] and especially as display sizes
[7112.66 → 7113.60] continue to scale,
[7113.70 → 7114.58] it's going to become
[7114.58 → 7115.42] more of an issue.
[7116.18 → 7116.74] Like I was,
[7117.88 → 7119.02] we did some sponsored spots
[7119.02 → 7120.12] for Amazon Luna
[7120.12 → 7121.52] earlier this week.
[7121.56 → 7122.58] I was shooting those with Sammy
[7122.58 → 7125.18] and you know,
[7125.24 → 7126.42] nothing against Amazon Luna.
[7126.60 → 7127.66] Latency feels pretty good.
[7127.70 → 7128.36] It seems pretty cool.
[7128.42 → 7129.48] I got some great games on it,
[7129.48 → 7130.78] but I fired it up
[7130.78 → 7132.68] on the 115-inch TV
[7132.68 → 7134.10] that I have in the theatre room
[7134.10 → 7134.84] and I was like,
[7134.88 → 7135.00] oh,
[7135.14 → 7136.10] that's a lot of compression
[7136.10 → 7137.66] and that's just the nature
[7137.66 → 7138.22] of the beast
[7138.22 → 7139.56] when it comes to stream content.
[7139.56 → 7140.60] As you blow it up
[7140.60 → 7141.32] bigger and bigger,
[7141.78 → 7143.34] those colour banding blocks
[7143.34 → 7144.50] or those compression blocks
[7144.50 → 7145.58] get more and more noticeable.
[7145.76 → 7146.38] I do think
[7146.38 → 7148.04] that local AI
[7148.04 → 7149.96] on our devices
[7149.96 → 7151.32] will help to smooth
[7151.32 → 7152.24] some of that stuff,
[7152.24 → 7152.60] but,
[7153.42 → 7153.94] but,
[7154.06 → 7155.26] you don't want those
[7155.26 → 7156.42] weird wheels in F1.
[7156.58 → 7158.18] What I'd really just rather have
[7158.18 → 7159.02] because it's garbage in,
[7159.08 → 7159.56] garbage out
[7159.56 → 7161.22] is not garbage to go in
[7161.22 → 7162.94] and then I could AI it even better,
[7163.06 → 7163.28] you know,
[7163.32 → 7163.76] like I'm,
[7163.88 → 7164.84] if you wanted or not.
[7165.26 → 7165.66] Or not.
[7165.66 → 7166.68] I've been seriously thinking
[7166.68 → 7167.48] buying a
[7167.48 → 7168.38] buying a Blu-ray
[7168.38 → 7168.76] of,
[7168.76 → 7169.66] uh,
[7169.66 → 7171.72] the Grand Budapest Hotel
[7171.72 → 7172.54] because I wanted to watch
[7172.54 → 7173.32] that with Emma
[7173.32 → 7174.32] and I was like,
[7174.36 → 7174.46] well,
[7174.48 → 7175.64] I want a good quality
[7175.64 → 7176.30] version of it.
[7176.78 → 7177.52] So like,
[7178.32 → 7180.08] you heard it here first folks,
[7180.22 → 7181.66] Luke considered buying a Blu-ray.
[7181.66 → 7182.40] How'd that go for you?
[7182.50 → 7183.10] Thought about it.
[7183.46 → 7184.30] Didn't end up doing it.
[7184.40 → 7184.60] Yeah.
[7184.68 → 7185.02] Okay.
[7185.62 → 7185.82] Well,
[7185.84 → 7186.46] you're part of the problem.
[7186.56 → 7186.70] Might,
[7186.74 → 7187.52] might still do it.
[7187.68 → 7187.88] Well,
[7187.90 → 7188.88] I haven't acquired it
[7188.88 → 7189.52] any other way.
[7192.84 → 7194.50] YouTube has broken
[7194.50 → 7195.92] video title links
[7195.92 → 7196.84] on publisher
[7196.84 → 7198.38] embedded videos.
[7198.50 → 7199.54] And the source here
[7199.54 → 7200.80] is The Verge.
[7201.30 → 7201.78] Um,
[7201.78 → 7202.56] here's their article.
[7202.80 → 7204.12] YouTube quietly made it
[7204.12 → 7206.00] so that some of its web embeds
[7206.00 → 7206.72] are worse,
[7207.04 → 7208.14] including ours.
[7208.34 → 7208.58] Huh?
[7208.58 → 7209.86] Here's why you can't
[7209.86 → 7210.88] click on the title
[7210.88 → 7212.22] to go back to YouTube
[7212.22 → 7213.22] on our videos.
[7213.30 → 7213.94] And this is an issue
[7213.94 → 7214.82] that I have to confess
[7214.82 → 7217.66] I had not considered it all.
[7217.80 → 7218.16] What?
[7218.62 → 7219.54] YouTube embeds
[7219.54 → 7220.40] on some websites
[7220.40 → 7221.16] like The Verge
[7221.16 → 7222.00] no longer let users
[7222.00 → 7222.76] click the video title
[7222.76 → 7223.40] to open it on
[7223.40 → 7224.00] YouTube.com
[7224.00 → 7224.70] or the YouTube app.
[7224.88 → 7225.64] This is because
[7225.64 → 7226.60] YouTube changed
[7226.60 → 7227.68] its YouTube player
[7227.68 → 7228.38] for publishers
[7228.38 → 7230.08] to remove branding,
[7230.42 → 7231.12] which apparently
[7231.12 → 7232.70] includes the title link
[7232.70 → 7233.66] according to YouTube.
[7233.66 → 7235.38] Publishers who want
[7235.38 → 7236.18] the link back
[7236.18 → 7237.68] must use the standard
[7237.68 → 7238.36] YouTube player
[7238.36 → 7239.22] which gives up
[7239.22 → 7239.74] ad revenue.
[7240.06 → 7240.22] So,
[7240.54 → 7240.74] uh,
[7240.74 → 7241.04] YouTube,
[7241.30 → 7241.58] uh,
[7241.58 → 7242.30] player for publishers
[7242.30 → 7242.98] allows you to put
[7242.98 → 7243.84] your own ads on it.
[7244.62 → 7245.52] I didn't even know
[7245.52 → 7246.88] that YouTube participated
[7246.88 → 7248.32] in the like,
[7248.64 → 7249.12] no,
[7249.86 → 7251.14] as just like a white box
[7251.14 → 7252.30] solution for like
[7252.30 → 7253.40] video embeds
[7253.40 → 7253.88] on your site.
[7253.98 → 7254.24] I like,
[7254.30 → 7255.14] I knew like Vimeo
[7255.14 → 7255.90] does stuff like that.
[7255.90 → 7256.52] I know there's other
[7256.52 → 7257.68] like bespoke ones
[7257.68 → 7259.14] that specialize in like
[7259.14 → 7259.94] yoga courses
[7259.94 → 7260.70] and things like that.
[7260.78 → 7261.60] I had no idea
[7261.60 → 7262.74] that YouTube even did this.
[7262.74 → 7264.00] Anyway,
[7264.24 → 7265.96] if you use a default
[7265.96 → 7267.46] regular YouTube embed
[7267.46 → 7268.62] that then YouTube
[7268.62 → 7269.40] will make more money
[7269.40 → 7269.90] and publishers
[7269.90 → 7270.76] will make less.
[7271.40 → 7271.98] YouTube says
[7271.98 → 7272.66] that this change
[7272.66 → 7273.82] is to protect
[7273.82 → 7275.50] advertisers and partners
[7275.50 → 7276.70] because they don't
[7276.70 → 7277.36] have visibility
[7277.36 → 7278.00] into the ads
[7278.00 → 7278.76] that are served
[7278.76 → 7280.06] in the YouTube player
[7280.06 → 7280.76] for publishers.
[7281.22 → 7281.98] But publishers
[7281.98 → 7282.72] like The Verge
[7282.72 → 7283.38] are frustrated
[7283.38 → 7285.82] because they
[7285.82 → 7287.14] can keep,
[7287.30 → 7287.54] wait,
[7287.60 → 7287.88] hold on,
[7288.42 → 7289.30] because their options
[7289.30 → 7290.54] are to keep
[7290.54 → 7291.34] the links broken
[7291.34 → 7292.02] so people can't
[7292.02 → 7292.56] navigate back
[7292.56 → 7292.98] to YouTube
[7292.98 → 7294.28] or they can switch
[7294.28 → 7295.06] to the standard player
[7295.06 → 7295.88] and lose revenue
[7295.88 → 7297.54] or they'll have
[7297.54 → 7298.30] to use another player
[7298.30 → 7298.92] that likely won't
[7298.92 → 7299.62] have a YouTube link
[7299.62 → 7300.06] anyway
[7300.06 → 7301.58] and it all just
[7301.58 → 7302.26] kind of sucks.
[7304.20 → 7304.64] Oh,
[7304.86 → 7305.54] just tell them
[7305.54 → 7305.88] no.
[7307.22 → 7307.44] Yeah,
[7307.62 → 7307.94] forget,
[7308.16 → 7309.32] we have enough
[7309.32 → 7309.72] topics.
[7310.46 → 7310.84] Riley,
[7311.02 → 7311.40] forget it.
[7311.72 → 7311.98] Put your,
[7312.06 → 7312.64] put your keyboard
[7312.64 → 7312.88] down,
[7312.94 → 7313.16] go home.
[7313.70 → 7315.06] I haven't listened
[7315.06 → 7315.84] to the podcast
[7315.84 → 7316.56] fully yet,
[7316.70 → 7317.88] but Dan on the
[7317.88 → 7318.54] Labs Web team
[7318.54 → 7319.24] shared it with me.
[7320.22 → 7320.60] I don't know,
[7320.66 → 7321.16] did we talk
[7321.16 → 7321.68] about this?
[7321.92 → 7322.20] Did we talk
[7322.20 → 7322.58] about this?
[7323.72 → 7323.96] No,
[7324.02 → 7324.30] I don't think
[7324.30 → 7324.54] we did.
[7324.92 → 7325.24] Yeah,
[7325.30 → 7326.18] they have a podcast
[7326.18 → 7327.28] on this that talks
[7327.28 → 7327.96] about like how
[7327.96 → 7328.68] they make money
[7328.68 → 7329.20] and how they've
[7329.20 → 7329.72] made money over
[7329.72 → 7330.16] the years
[7330.16 → 7330.76] and like how
[7330.76 → 7332.60] running a
[7332.60 → 7333.98] ad-funded business
[7333.98 → 7335.20] on the internet
[7335.20 → 7336.14] in current year
[7336.14 → 7337.26] is really hard
[7337.26 → 7338.26] and things are going
[7338.26 → 7338.62] to subscription
[7338.62 → 7339.14] models and stuff.
[7339.52 → 7340.38] It's fascinating.
[7340.58 → 7341.32] I'm like a little bit
[7341.32 → 7341.90] into the podcast,
[7342.04 → 7342.72] haven't listened
[7342.72 → 7343.26] to the whole thing.
[7343.26 → 7343.70] I'm planning to
[7343.70 → 7344.08] finish it off
[7344.08 → 7344.56] this weekend.
[7345.78 → 7346.54] But like,
[7346.82 → 7347.16] yeah,
[7347.26 → 7348.26] The Verge is being
[7348.26 → 7350.60] public and transparent
[7350.60 → 7351.44] about things right now,
[7351.48 → 7352.42] which is very
[7352.42 → 7353.48] interesting to me.
[7353.58 → 7353.90] Very cool.
[7354.02 → 7354.58] I don't know how many
[7354.58 → 7355.10] other people,
[7355.38 → 7355.84] but it's very
[7355.84 → 7356.46] interesting to me.
[7357.80 → 7358.66] It's cool because
[7358.66 → 7359.08] like,
[7359.22 → 7359.58] honestly,
[7359.58 → 7360.48] I look at a lot
[7360.48 → 7360.98] of these sites,
[7361.46 → 7362.52] including The Verge,
[7362.68 → 7363.30] heavily including
[7363.30 → 7363.72] The Verge,
[7363.78 → 7364.42] and I really
[7364.42 → 7366.60] don't understand
[7366.60 → 7367.32] how they make
[7367.32 → 7368.28] the money that they make,
[7368.90 → 7369.62] knowing like how
[7369.62 → 7370.56] many people they employ
[7370.56 → 7371.66] and like how much
[7371.66 → 7372.72] of a showing they've had.
[7372.72 → 7373.76] It like shows like CES
[7373.76 → 7374.60] and stuff in the past.
[7375.00 → 7375.20] Like,
[7375.26 → 7375.44] man,
[7375.50 → 7375.94] like your stuff
[7375.94 → 7376.72] is getting this much
[7376.72 → 7377.92] traffic to pay for all this.
[7377.98 → 7378.42] That's crazy.
[7380.22 → 7381.00] So it's,
[7381.04 → 7382.86] it's cool having them
[7382.86 → 7384.14] kind of show behind
[7384.14 → 7384.84] the veil a little bit.
[7386.36 → 7387.08] So our,
[7387.10 → 7388.14] our conversation here
[7388.14 → 7388.70] is like,
[7388.72 → 7390.42] what's the deal?
[7390.46 → 7391.32] Because I honestly,
[7391.44 → 7391.64] I,
[7391.70 → 7393.68] I kind of agree
[7393.68 → 7394.50] with YouTube
[7394.50 → 7396.28] that if it's not a
[7396.40 → 7396.64] like,
[7396.72 → 7397.36] if it's not supposed
[7397.36 → 7398.62] to be like YouTube,
[7398.78 → 7399.44] if it's,
[7399.44 → 7399.84] you know,
[7400.34 → 7401.24] player for publishers,
[7401.24 → 7402.04] but okay,
[7402.10 → 7402.26] yeah,
[7402.26 → 7403.10] it has YouTube on it.
[7403.18 → 7404.10] This seems to me like
[7404.10 → 7405.02] your own ads on it.
[7405.02 → 7405.58] Like they have like
[7405.58 → 7407.02] a branding issue here
[7407.02 → 7408.62] because I wouldn't want
[7408.62 → 7409.80] that to be YouTube branded
[7409.80 → 7410.54] if I was YouTube
[7410.54 → 7411.42] and I have no idea
[7411.42 → 7412.22] what ads are going
[7412.22 → 7412.66] to be on it
[7412.66 → 7415.60] or what I get it.
[7415.70 → 7416.54] But on the other hand,
[7416.54 → 7417.24] I totally see
[7417.24 → 7417.68] where the verge
[7417.68 → 7418.28] is coming from
[7418.28 → 7420.14] where in their mind,
[7420.14 → 7421.88] this product has been degraded
[7421.88 → 7423.54] and they were using it.
[7423.62 → 7424.94] And that's just the nature
[7424.94 → 7425.46] of this.
[7425.86 → 7426.94] Everything's a subscription.
[7426.94 → 7429.20] Everything is as a service
[7429.20 → 7431.22] world that we live in
[7431.22 → 7432.98] where whatever the deal was,
[7433.00 → 7435.04] it can just change unilaterally
[7435.04 → 7435.82] and it's not up to you.
[7435.86 → 7436.80] Like from my point of view,
[7436.80 → 7437.64] I don't even really see
[7437.64 → 7438.70] the product as degraded.
[7438.70 → 7439.16] If anything,
[7439.36 → 7440.02] I would think
[7440.02 → 7441.04] if I wanted video embeds
[7441.04 → 7441.62] on my site,
[7441.74 → 7443.04] not having YouTube branding
[7443.04 → 7443.40] all over,
[7443.44 → 7444.12] it would be a plus.
[7445.00 → 7446.00] But if people like
[7446.00 → 7446.76] the YouTube interface
[7446.76 → 7447.18] and that's where
[7447.18 → 7447.82] they want to watch it
[7447.82 → 7448.94] and engage with other viewers,
[7449.14 → 7450.06] then yeah,
[7450.10 → 7450.98] I can see how it could
[7450.98 → 7451.82] also be a minus.
[7451.94 → 7452.90] I think this is a
[7453.02 → 7453.44] I really,
[7453.44 → 7454.38] I really see this one
[7454.38 → 7456.46] from both sides.
[7459.98 → 7461.28] Like I can definitely see
[7461.28 → 7462.30] why if you're using something
[7462.30 → 7463.38] and you like the way it works,
[7463.66 → 7464.70] like it could be something
[7464.70 → 7465.46] as simple as like
[7465.46 → 7466.76] the YouTube Creator Studio
[7466.76 → 7467.60] mobile app.
[7467.82 → 7469.18] Like it used to have
[7469.18 → 7470.64] a way that
[7470.64 → 7473.04] from the dashboard here,
[7473.14 → 7474.52] I could just slide in
[7474.52 → 7475.14] from the side
[7475.14 → 7476.74] and select which channel analytics
[7476.74 → 7477.50] I wanted to see.
[7477.72 → 7478.94] Now I have to click this,
[7479.12 → 7480.12] then click this,
[7480.36 → 7481.06] then click it.
[7481.40 → 7482.20] So they just like
[7482.20 → 7482.96] added extra clicks
[7482.96 → 7483.54] and I hate that,
[7483.60 → 7484.38] but I'm sure for someone
[7484.38 → 7485.48] it's like better this way.
[7485.54 → 7485.76] Maybe,
[7485.86 → 7486.08] I don't know,
[7486.12 → 7487.42] the mobile app development team,
[7487.46 → 7487.84] no offence,
[7488.00 → 7488.52] but you guys,
[7488.88 → 7489.98] you'd be better off
[7489.98 → 7490.86] if you just hadn't touched it
[7490.86 → 7491.86] for the last like five years.
[7492.34 → 7494.06] But that's a separate conversation.
[7494.88 → 7495.90] They've fixed some stuff,
[7496.60 → 7497.86] but they mostly just like
[7497.86 → 7499.72] have not improved
[7499.72 → 7501.02] the things that I think
[7501.02 → 7501.68] are actually important
[7501.68 → 7502.22] for interacting
[7502.22 → 7502.80] with your community.
[7503.04 → 7503.48] But yeah.
[7505.54 → 7506.16] Last topic.
[7506.74 → 7507.44] I would say that
[7507.44 → 7508.36] I'd be happy to have calls
[7508.36 → 7508.94] with you guys
[7508.94 → 7509.40] and, you know,
[7509.42 → 7510.12] talk about ways
[7510.12 → 7510.74] that you could fix it,
[7510.78 → 7511.40] but we've done that
[7511.40 → 7511.94] and you didn't listen
[7511.94 → 7512.44] to any of it
[7512.44 → 7512.98] and now it's worse.
[7513.48 → 7513.68] Sorry,
[7513.80 → 7514.00] sorry,
[7514.12 → 7514.32] sorry,
[7514.42 → 7514.58] sorry.
[7515.92 → 7516.54] Last topic?
[7516.92 → 7517.52] I don't know.
[7517.56 → 7518.04] It's kind of boring.
[7518.14 → 7518.76] NVIDIA brings back
[7518.76 → 7519.46] GeForce LAN,
[7519.62 → 7520.28] so they're promoting
[7520.28 → 7521.28] probably a GPU,
[7521.42 → 7521.88] I would assume.
[7522.08 → 7522.30] What?
[7523.94 → 7524.30] Wait,
[7524.30 → 7525.82] it features a 50-hour
[7525.82 → 7526.58] gaming marathon?
[7526.78 → 7528.22] That's a specific number.
[7528.78 → 7529.46] And it'll be on
[7529.46 → 7530.28] an aircraft carrier
[7530.28 → 7531.06] and it's US only.
[7531.60 → 7531.88] Oh.
[7532.22 → 7532.40] Yeah,
[7532.40 → 7532.84] the last time
[7532.84 → 7533.42] they did one of these
[7533.42 → 7534.24] was a long time ago
[7534.24 → 7535.16] and they did an aircraft
[7535.16 → 7535.74] carrier LAN,
[7535.84 → 7536.28] so that was cool
[7536.28 → 7537.76] for the 400
[7537.76 → 7538.98] regular gamers
[7538.98 → 7539.94] who are allowed to go.
[7539.94 → 7540.46] Yeah.
[7541.88 → 7542.96] Or everyday gamers.
[7543.12 → 7543.30] Sorry,
[7543.42 → 7543.84] what's the term?
[7544.46 → 7545.16] Discussion question
[7545.16 → 7546.68] is epic whale land collab.
[7546.88 → 7547.00] Yeah,
[7547.06 → 7547.22] yeah,
[7547.32 → 7548.10] they'll bring the ship,
[7548.30 → 7548.96] we'll bring the whales.
[7548.96 → 7549.16] The whales.
[7549.64 → 7549.82] Yeah.
[7550.86 → 7551.12] All right,
[7551.16 → 7551.98] what else are we doing today?
[7552.48 → 7553.54] I think that's it for topics.
[7553.72 → 7554.48] Merch massages.
[7554.48 → 7555.88] Are we after dark?
[7557.40 → 7557.76] Yeah.
[7557.98 → 7558.14] Oh,
[7558.18 → 7558.72] this is hilarious.
[7558.96 → 7559.76] Trending on X.
[7559.94 → 7560.86] Elon Musk pushed
[7560.86 → 7561.84] for open AI profit
[7561.84 → 7562.76] new email show.
[7562.96 → 7564.02] So you're not mad
[7564.02 → 7564.60] that they switched
[7564.60 → 7565.22] to for profit,
[7565.30 → 7565.82] you're just mad
[7565.82 → 7566.64] that they didn't do it
[7566.64 → 7567.04] for you.
[7567.22 → 7567.36] Oh.
[7567.72 → 7568.50] I think he also
[7568.50 → 7569.98] did still want it
[7569.98 → 7570.84] to be open,
[7570.96 → 7571.78] he just also wanted
[7571.78 → 7572.38] it to make money,
[7572.48 → 7573.02] if I remember correctly.
[7573.20 → 7574.22] These are new emails.
[7574.44 → 7574.70] Yeah,
[7574.78 → 7575.02] oh no,
[7575.08 → 7575.22] I know.
[7575.26 → 7576.38] Maybe it's more
[7576.38 → 7578.32] reinforcing or something,
[7578.44 → 7579.16] but we've known this
[7579.16 → 7580.20] for a long time.
[7581.90 → 7582.58] You think Elon
[7582.58 → 7583.28] didn't want to make
[7583.28 → 7584.28] big dollars?
[7584.48 → 7585.68] What are you talking about?
[7585.70 → 7585.96] Yeah,
[7585.98 → 7586.14] yeah,
[7586.14 → 7586.32] yeah,
[7586.32 → 7586.48] yeah,
[7586.48 → 7586.62] yeah.
[7591.62 → 7591.98] Yeah,
[7592.04 → 7592.48] let's do it.
[7593.98 → 7594.38] Oh,
[7594.44 → 7595.02] that was quick.
[7596.48 → 7597.22] I was waiting.
[7597.82 → 7598.60] I was waiting.
[7598.68 → 7599.04] I wasn't sure
[7599.04 → 7599.60] if you're going to
[7599.60 → 7600.12] branch off
[7600.12 → 7600.80] into something else.
[7601.12 → 7602.04] That's fair.
[7603.70 → 7604.06] Bye,
[7604.14 → 7604.34] Sammy.
[7604.82 → 7605.18] Bye.
[7605.52 → 7606.36] Why is Sammy still here?
[7606.36 → 7607.16] Why are you still here?
[7607.34 → 7607.94] There's lots of people
[7607.94 → 7608.38] still here.
[7609.24 → 7610.18] Why is Brian out of the club?
[7610.48 → 7610.74] Oh,
[7610.80 → 7610.94] yeah,
[7610.96 → 7612.24] we started WAN show on time.
[7612.34 → 7612.92] It's only like
[7612.92 → 7613.76] almost seven,
[7613.76 → 7615.36] which is pretty late
[7615.36 → 7615.92] or whatever,
[7616.12 → 7616.44] but like
[7616.44 → 7617.50] very early for us.
[7617.52 → 7617.62] Yeah,
[7617.62 → 7618.74] very early for us
[7618.74 → 7619.82] to be on After Dark.
[7620.16 → 7620.46] Yeah.
[7621.98 → 7622.34] Wow,
[7622.38 → 7622.84] we don't got to get
[7622.84 → 7624.06] Luke home for eight.
[7624.98 → 7625.34] Oh,
[7625.38 → 7625.58] wow.
[7625.88 → 7626.14] Yeah,
[7626.20 → 7626.72] you're going to be home
[7626.72 → 7627.62] before eight today.
[7627.86 → 7628.06] Yeah,
[7628.06 → 7628.42] that's good.
[7628.50 → 7628.92] You're not even going
[7628.92 → 7629.82] to need those chocolates.
[7634.46 → 7635.64] That wasn't even a joke.
[7635.82 → 7636.12] I don't even think.
[7636.12 → 7636.76] Are those like,
[7637.40 → 7639.36] do younger people
[7639.36 → 7640.16] even know what those are?
[7640.26 → 7640.74] After eight?
[7640.90 → 7641.18] Yeah.
[7641.18 → 7641.68] I don't know.
[7642.32 → 7642.56] I mean,
[7642.58 → 7642.90] they wouldn't.
[7642.96 → 7643.40] They go to bed.
[7646.46 → 7646.86] Oh,
[7646.86 → 7647.42] man.
[7647.92 → 7648.24] Oh,
[7648.24 → 7648.52] boy.
[7649.36 → 7649.76] No,
[7649.84 → 7650.24] I don't think
[7650.24 → 7650.76] we're going to stream
[7650.76 → 7651.50] super checks tonight.
[7651.64 → 7652.32] Luke's all salty
[7652.32 → 7653.24] because he's bad at it.
[7653.62 → 7653.78] No,
[7653.92 → 7654.44] I'm not salty.
[7654.44 → 7654.68] He won't play with me anymore.
[7654.92 → 7655.08] Okay.
[7655.68 → 7658.16] It's the Smash Bros problem,
[7658.32 → 7658.60] okay?
[7658.78 → 7658.98] Yeah,
[7659.04 → 7660.02] no Smash Bros.
[7660.02 → 7662.22] I did screw that up.
[7663.00 → 7664.88] If you own Smash Bros
[7664.88 → 7666.64] or potentially Bros
[7666.64 → 7668.38] and you play it a bunch,
[7669.22 → 7671.02] say you go to the store
[7671.02 → 7671.52] with your friends
[7671.52 → 7672.90] and you buy Smash Bros
[7672.90 → 7673.92] and you go home
[7673.92 → 7674.48] and you play
[7674.48 → 7675.12] and it's all fun
[7675.12 → 7676.40] and then they go home
[7676.40 → 7678.96] and don't play
[7678.96 → 7680.20] and you grind
[7680.20 → 7682.72] and then they come back
[7682.72 → 7683.80] and you all play,
[7683.88 → 7684.54] it's not going to be fun.
[7685.54 → 7686.82] We played super checks
[7686.82 → 7688.02] and we streamed it
[7688.02 → 7688.76] one time.
[7688.76 → 7690.98] And the one time
[7690.98 → 7691.72] that we streamed it,
[7691.92 → 7693.30] Linus studied the tape
[7693.30 → 7695.88] like a collegiate athlete
[7695.88 → 7696.60] or something
[7696.60 → 7698.82] and then like figured out
[7698.82 → 7699.48] how I play
[7699.48 → 7700.36] and jumped up
[7700.36 → 7701.46] in skill level a bunch
[7701.46 → 7702.26] and then it like
[7702.26 → 7703.30] wasn't very competitive
[7703.30 → 7706.50] and that's just so lame.
[7706.68 → 7707.40] So in summary,
[7707.58 → 7708.88] skill issue.
[7709.10 → 7710.40] It's so lame.
[7712.82 → 7714.02] My goodness.
[7714.78 → 7715.20] Oh,
[7715.28 → 7715.62] man.
[7716.36 → 7717.58] You were already better.
[7717.58 → 7719.08] Barely though.
[7719.46 → 7719.80] Yeah.
[7719.92 → 7720.70] And now I'm way better.
[7720.70 → 7721.64] But that made it competitive
[7721.64 → 7722.44] and fun.
[7723.16 → 7724.02] My goodness.
[7725.64 → 7727.68] I told you to study the tape too.
[7727.80 → 7728.46] I told you.
[7728.46 → 7728.94] I don't want to do that.
[7728.96 → 7730.98] I told you I was studying the tape.
[7732.98 → 7733.42] Ridiculous.
[7734.88 → 7736.10] I told Yvonne.
[7737.10 → 7738.38] I tried to get him in trouble.
[7738.38 → 7739.00] No.
[7741.00 → 7742.00] No, I'm just cheating.
[7742.72 → 7744.30] By being better than me
[7744.30 → 7745.64] at everything.
[7746.30 → 7746.96] That's not true.
[7747.18 → 7748.02] No, there are lots of things
[7748.02 → 7748.78] he's better than I at.
[7749.02 → 7750.40] The usual curve
[7750.40 → 7752.48] is that if we fire up a new game.
[7752.48 → 7753.16] Depends on the topic.
[7753.16 → 7755.38] I am better than Luke
[7755.38 → 7758.16] for like 25 minutes,
[7758.58 → 7759.56] maybe less,
[7759.96 → 7761.66] and then he is better than me
[7761.66 → 7763.64] forever after that.
[7763.68 → 7764.48] It depends on the type of game.
[7764.50 → 7765.94] That's usually how it works though.
[7766.04 → 7766.78] Depends on the type of game.
[7766.82 → 7768.02] That's usually how it works.
[7768.28 → 7768.76] There are some,
[7768.86 → 7770.66] I think it would take me
[7770.66 → 7774.14] extreme amounts of time
[7774.14 → 7774.90] to catch up to you
[7774.90 → 7775.50] in Super Commander.
[7775.96 → 7776.74] The Supreme Commander?
[7776.82 → 7777.36] Supreme Commander.
[7777.44 → 7777.84] Oh, yeah, no.
[7778.08 → 7778.82] Super Commander.
[7778.82 → 7780.24] It would take you like
[7780.24 → 7781.48] tens of hours.
[7781.60 → 7782.60] Yeah, at least.
[7782.84 → 7782.96] Yeah.
[7785.02 → 7785.38] But.
[7785.76 → 7787.12] What are you snickering at, Dan?
[7787.12 → 7788.22] But that's a game
[7788.22 → 7789.90] that I have so many more hours in.
[7790.00 → 7790.72] So if we actually look
[7790.72 → 7791.80] at the curve from the moment
[7791.80 → 7792.68] of starting to play,
[7792.80 → 7793.46] you're probably better
[7793.46 → 7794.62] than I was at that period.
[7795.22 → 7796.56] Because Linus said tens of hours,
[7796.66 → 7797.60] not hundreds of hours.
[7797.72 → 7798.90] So it was like a slight compliment,
[7799.08 → 7799.34] I think.
[7799.90 → 7800.98] Yeah, well, no, no, no.
[7801.18 → 7801.70] That was what I was.
[7801.86 → 7803.74] I have like many, many, many,
[7803.74 → 7804.84] many, many hours in that game.
[7804.92 → 7805.98] Like back when it came out
[7805.98 → 7806.32] and stuff.
[7806.32 → 7807.80] And it's the kind of game
[7807.80 → 7808.52] where like,
[7808.82 → 7810.32] there are so many variations
[7810.32 → 7811.24] in strategy
[7811.24 → 7812.44] that the only way
[7812.44 → 7813.22] to be good at it
[7813.22 → 7814.96] is to have played
[7814.96 → 7816.08] a ton of matches.
[7816.32 → 7817.12] The skill ceiling
[7817.12 → 7817.94] is like infinite.
[7818.12 → 7819.18] So being good at it
[7819.18 → 7820.54] in tens of hours is fine.
[7820.68 → 7820.76] Yeah.
[7820.82 → 7822.26] One of the most wild things to me
[7822.26 → 7823.08] is because we've played
[7823.08 → 7824.28] like on the internet
[7824.28 → 7825.32] with internet people before.
[7825.50 → 7826.18] One of the things
[7826.18 → 7827.30] that like hurts my brain
[7827.30 → 7828.84] is that you're so much beyond
[7828.84 → 7830.88] like myself and your son
[7830.88 → 7832.14] who will play you sometimes
[7832.14 → 7834.86] that he seems like a god to me.
[7834.94 → 7835.38] And then we'll play
[7835.38 → 7836.18] against internet people
[7836.18 → 7837.24] and he'll get stomped.
[7837.34 → 7837.86] And I'm just like,
[7837.86 → 7838.98] Oh dude,
[7839.02 → 7839.80] I'm not even good.
[7840.38 → 7842.24] Like I was pretty good
[7842.24 → 7844.58] in like 2007 or whatever.
[7844.82 → 7845.00] Right.
[7845.10 → 7845.32] And like,
[7845.44 → 7846.20] then those people,
[7846.32 → 7847.68] some of them still play.
[7847.86 → 7848.10] Yeah.
[7848.76 → 7849.44] That's how I feel
[7849.44 → 7850.32] playing Factor.
[7850.82 → 7852.20] Like I've got nearly
[7852.20 → 7853.18] a thousand hours
[7853.18 → 7854.50] and I'm like bad at it.
[7855.46 → 7856.24] There's some people
[7856.24 → 7857.54] who are just bonkers.
[7858.02 → 7858.22] Yeah.
[7858.58 → 7860.24] The one that hurt me
[7860.24 → 7861.62] that way for forever
[7861.62 → 7863.24] was Joe and I used to play
[7863.24 → 7864.60] the crap out of Rocket League.
[7864.60 → 7866.50] We were very good
[7866.50 → 7867.18] at Rocket League.
[7868.18 → 7869.36] Diamond and Rocket League.
[7870.06 → 7871.14] Champion at one point
[7871.14 → 7871.76] in Rocket League.
[7872.70 → 7874.14] But a specific type
[7874.14 → 7874.86] of Rocket League.
[7874.86 → 7875.62] Oh, the hockey one.
[7875.76 → 7875.98] Yeah.
[7876.06 → 7876.28] Yeah.
[7876.76 → 7877.98] We go to try to play
[7877.98 → 7879.40] with the soccer ball.
[7880.50 → 7881.28] I had no idea
[7881.28 → 7881.80] it was happening.
[7884.10 → 7885.24] Nothing worked at all.
[7885.44 → 7886.44] I was so lost.
[7886.98 → 7887.48] I don't know.
[7887.60 → 7887.90] Whatever.
[7887.90 → 7889.90] Anyway.
[7891.82 → 7892.16] Okay.
[7892.30 → 7893.10] Well, let's get some
[7893.10 → 7894.32] merch messages in you guys.
[7894.90 → 7895.72] Any memories you care
[7895.72 → 7896.68] to share about the PC
[7896.68 → 7897.40] you built
[7897.40 → 7899.38] in the Denver Micro Centre?
[7899.68 → 7900.52] I go there a lot
[7900.52 → 7900.98] and some people
[7900.98 → 7902.26] still remember your visit.
[7903.06 → 7904.36] Was that the weird
[7904.36 → 7905.68] like we water cooled
[7905.68 → 7906.58] it wrong one?
[7908.30 → 7908.74] What?
[7908.90 → 7910.40] I think it was.
[7910.46 → 7912.40] We built like a super weird
[7912.40 → 7913.76] I was trying to come up.
[7913.94 → 7914.44] Oh, hey,
[7914.48 → 7915.40] I'm reminded of this.
[7915.64 → 7917.16] We sponsored DIY perks.
[7917.16 → 7917.86] Let's go.
[7917.94 → 7918.78] Go watch DIY perks
[7918.78 → 7919.80] after this.
[7919.96 → 7920.24] Nice.
[7920.48 → 7920.70] Yeah.
[7920.72 → 7921.88] He did like a weird
[7921.88 → 7923.28] surround sound laser thing.
[7923.38 → 7924.26] I came out today.
[7924.32 → 7924.98] I haven't had a chance
[7924.98 → 7925.66] to watch it yet,
[7925.66 → 7925.98] but
[7925.98 → 7931.48] I watched this before work.
[7932.04 → 7934.40] His videos are so sick.
[7934.40 → 7934.92] Let's go.
[7936.56 → 7938.48] DIY perks is my idol.
[7938.94 → 7939.80] Sponsoring all the
[7939.80 → 7941.32] the coolest YouTubers.
[7942.52 → 7943.26] We are a sponsor
[7943.26 → 7944.04] of DIY perks.
[7944.14 → 7944.82] Let's go.
[7945.06 → 7945.54] That's awesome.
[7945.54 → 7946.12] Hell yeah.
[7946.28 → 7946.56] Yeah.
[7946.56 → 7947.56] Yeah.
[7949.34 → 7949.74] Okay.
[7949.82 → 7950.74] What was I searching for?
[7952.98 → 7954.06] My first centre.
[7954.74 → 7955.16] I don't know.
[7955.36 → 7956.16] Here, let's see if we can
[7956.16 → 7957.24] let's see if we can find this.
[7957.44 → 7958.94] So this is this one was fun,
[7959.00 → 7960.30] but this one was in California.
[7960.82 → 7962.04] Dude, I could
[7962.04 → 7964.52] if I was a conspiracy theorist,
[7964.66 → 7967.12] I would think this video is staged
[7967.12 → 7969.02] like how perfectly
[7969.02 → 7970.24] the whole thing turned out.
[7970.28 → 7971.70] It 100% was not.
[7971.80 → 7972.50] She just happened to be
[7972.50 → 7973.14] the first person
[7973.14 → 7974.22] who asked us about that PC
[7974.22 → 7975.00] and bought it for 20 bucks.
[7976.48 → 7977.74] I don't think I've seen that video.
[7977.88 → 7978.88] Oh yeah, this is the one.
[7979.22 → 7980.36] Yeah, we just built
[7980.36 → 7982.02] like the stupidest computer.
[7982.18 → 7982.52] I forget.
[7983.48 → 7984.68] I forget why.
[7986.12 → 7987.12] Oh yeah, because
[7987.12 → 7988.78] I think it was because
[7988.78 → 7989.82] it had to be their demo.
[7989.94 → 7990.34] So I was like,
[7990.40 → 7990.90] this is hilarious.
[7991.00 → 7992.18] I should like to build it wrong.
[7992.18 → 7995.06] So I put like really weird
[7995.06 → 7996.90] like cooling stuff in it
[7996.90 → 7997.30] and stuff.
[7997.40 → 7998.18] That's such a line.
[7998.18 → 7998.86] It's moved.
[8001.30 → 8002.88] You have to display this forever.
[8005.34 → 8006.32] Well, they dragged me
[8006.32 → 8007.36] all the way up to Denver.
[8007.64 → 8008.14] Oh my God.
[8009.70 → 8010.76] Look, I need a butt.
[8010.76 → 8020.02] Oh my goodness.
[8021.06 → 8021.94] That's great.
[8022.18 → 8023.18] Oh man.
[8025.08 → 8025.52] Anyway.
[8026.58 → 8027.80] Yes, I remember that.
[8028.02 → 8029.12] I remember the team
[8029.12 → 8029.84] being a lot of fun.
[8029.92 → 8031.08] I remember them being super cool.
[8031.40 → 8031.66] Cool.
[8032.14 → 8032.42] Nice.
[8032.60 → 8033.66] No, I'm not talking bad
[8033.66 → 8034.12] about Denver.
[8034.20 → 8035.28] I'm just saying it's far away.
[8035.70 → 8036.48] He doesn't like travelling.
[8036.90 → 8037.26] Yeah.
[8038.08 → 8038.34] Okay.
[8038.34 → 8039.46] I understood immediately.
[8040.34 → 8041.98] What are Linus's mods
[8041.98 → 8042.74] on Beat Safer?
[8043.68 → 8046.04] Oh, just like better song search
[8046.04 → 8048.28] and like leaderboards
[8048.28 → 8051.50] and like I don't care about
[8051.50 → 8052.70] any of the mapping extensions
[8052.70 → 8053.48] or anything like that.
[8053.54 → 8055.04] I just like to hit notes.
[8055.56 → 8058.24] So I'm super boring and vanilla
[8058.24 → 8059.58] when it comes to Beat Safer modding.
[8059.62 → 8060.78] It already breaks off enough
[8060.78 → 8063.30] that I keep it minimal.
[8064.52 → 8065.70] Are you able to share
[8065.70 → 8066.38] how successful
[8066.38 → 8068.12] your Black Friday week was?
[8068.12 → 8068.66] For example,
[8068.72 → 8069.48] how many screwdrivers
[8069.48 → 8069.86] you sold?
[8072.58 → 8073.22] I don't know.
[8073.26 → 8073.42] Sure.
[8073.60 → 8074.14] F*** it.
[8076.62 → 8078.12] Be careful how you do so.
[8078.32 → 8078.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8078.54 → 8079.66] It's your decision to do so.
[8079.72 → 8080.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8080.38 → 8081.82] Luke, should I not curate
[8081.82 → 8083.46] these types of messages anymore?
[8083.80 → 8084.50] No, I mean,
[8085.34 → 8085.86] it's his company.
[8086.72 → 8087.22] Is it though?
[8087.92 → 8088.28] Yes.
[8088.46 → 8088.66] Yeah.
[8091.24 → 8091.96] Shut up, Luke.
[8091.96 → 8102.92] Let's see if I can find the...
[8102.92 → 8103.96] Did someone just kill my internet?
[8104.52 → 8107.22] I just got logged out of my G Suite.
[8108.40 → 8109.78] Did somebody just do that?
[8110.24 → 8110.52] Luke!
[8110.52 → 8110.58] Luke!
[8110.58 → 8112.02] My hands even removed.
[8112.10 → 8112.64] It wasn't me.
[8112.72 → 8113.22] It's AJ.
[8113.46 → 8114.30] AJ's here though.
[8114.30 → 8116.80] What?
[8117.08 → 8118.12] What the heck?
[8118.28 → 8118.90] I'm so sorry.
[8119.02 → 8120.24] Shopify went down.
[8121.96 → 8122.74] Oh no.
[8122.94 → 8124.36] I'm not saying he did do that.
[8124.52 → 8125.86] I'm just saying he could.
[8126.98 → 8127.44] Here we go.
[8127.48 → 8128.24] Post event summary.
[8129.28 → 8129.90] Dot doc X.
[8130.18 → 8131.04] I'm not going...
[8131.04 → 8131.60] Don't worry.
[8132.16 → 8132.74] Relax.
[8132.90 → 8134.50] That would have been horrible.
[8135.18 → 8135.70] Relax.
[8135.70 → 8137.54] Okay.
[8137.82 → 8138.16] So,
[8138.66 → 8141.06] we beat our revenue forecast
[8141.06 → 8142.54] by 30%.
[8142.54 → 8144.00] Which is enormous.
[8144.18 → 8145.44] Which is huge.
[8145.88 → 8147.40] A big part of that
[8147.40 → 8150.36] was down to the deals
[8150.36 → 8151.04] we were offering.
[8151.64 → 8153.24] The hard work
[8153.24 → 8154.16] that the team did
[8154.16 → 8155.26] to get...
[8155.26 → 8155.70] Hold on.
[8155.74 → 8156.38] I'm just going to open this
[8156.38 → 8156.98] with Google Docs
[8156.98 → 8157.74] instead of the preview.
[8158.92 → 8160.30] Huge shout out to the team.
[8162.00 → 8162.34] Man,
[8162.60 → 8163.38] I...
[8163.38 → 8164.18] It's one of those things.
[8164.22 → 8165.04] It's a double-edged sword.
[8165.04 → 8166.16] I want to call out
[8166.16 → 8167.16] individual contributors
[8167.16 → 8170.22] but I don't want to miss anybody
[8170.22 → 8171.52] because then if I do
[8171.52 → 8172.44] then it's like...
[8172.44 → 8172.92] Yeah.
[8173.34 → 8174.02] Double suck.
[8174.46 → 8175.62] It gets really rough
[8175.62 → 8176.16] to be honest.
[8176.28 → 8177.32] But I will say
[8177.32 → 8180.70] that the team at CW
[8180.70 → 8182.12] so Sarah,
[8182.36 → 8182.66] Artie,
[8182.88 → 8184.36] worked especially hard
[8184.36 → 8185.74] on like the landing pages
[8185.74 → 8187.00] and newsletters.
[8187.96 → 8189.54] Artie worked really hard
[8189.54 → 8190.54] with the production team
[8190.54 → 8191.88] on a couple of shorts.
[8192.04 → 8192.58] Also awesome.
[8192.68 → 8194.68] Like that super long shaft one.
[8194.68 → 8196.10] You genuinely just performed
[8196.10 → 8197.08] really well videos.
[8197.32 → 8197.60] Yep.
[8197.80 → 8198.00] Yep.
[8198.12 → 8200.00] Those were just good videos.
[8201.94 → 8202.88] Huge shout out
[8202.88 → 8203.74] to the entire
[8203.74 → 8204.60] Creator Warehouse team.
[8204.72 → 8205.14] Like obviously
[8205.14 → 8206.36] the design of the products,
[8206.48 → 8206.82] packaging,
[8207.36 → 8208.08] like everything.
[8208.48 → 8209.72] But also like
[8209.72 → 8211.02] Nick and Dave
[8211.02 → 8212.38] who worked on
[8212.38 → 8213.04] a lot of the
[8213.04 → 8214.00] like nitty-gritty
[8214.00 → 8215.00] of the promotions.
[8215.80 → 8216.48] But anyway,
[8216.64 → 8216.92] so yeah.
[8216.96 → 8217.52] So how'd we do?
[8217.52 → 8219.80] Yeah,
[8219.84 → 8220.54] we beat our forecast
[8220.54 → 8221.54] by 30%.
[8221.54 → 8222.52] We...
[8222.52 → 8222.78] Hold on.
[8222.86 → 8223.50] Key results.
[8223.62 → 8224.02] Let me just see
[8224.02 → 8225.20] if I can find a thing here.
[8225.80 → 8226.62] The float plane
[8226.62 → 8227.56] early access
[8227.56 → 8230.02] was hugely impactful.
[8230.28 → 8230.70] We drove
[8230.70 → 8231.48] almost
[8231.48 → 8233.16] 1,500 new
[8233.16 → 8233.86] float plane members
[8233.86 → 8234.32] with that.
[8234.44 → 8235.32] That was super cool.
[8235.32 → 8237.96] Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.
[8239.64 → 8241.38] Key offers
[8241.38 → 8242.10] and perform
[8242.10 → 8243.32] recipients.
[8243.88 → 8244.50] The email
[8244.50 → 8245.46] e-blasts
[8245.46 → 8246.50] performed really well.
[8247.16 → 8248.28] We apparently
[8248.28 → 8249.22] had a
[8249.22 → 8250.78] 58%
[8250.78 → 8251.66] open rate
[8251.66 → 8253.06] on our email campaign
[8253.06 → 8254.32] which is like...
[8254.88 → 8255.48] Enormous.
[8256.02 → 8256.54] What?
[8257.06 → 8257.92] I don't even remember
[8257.92 → 8258.64] the last time I opened
[8258.64 → 8259.32] a market email
[8259.32 → 8259.94] from anyone.
[8260.52 → 8261.18] And an
[8261.18 → 8262.12] 18%
[8262.12 → 8262.88] click-through rate
[8262.88 → 8263.62] which is like
[8263.62 → 8264.60] if there's any people
[8264.60 → 8266.60] who work
[8266.60 → 8267.54] in that industry
[8267.54 → 8270.82] let people know
[8270.82 → 8271.86] in the chat
[8271.86 → 8273.70] how mind-blowing
[8273.70 → 8274.94] those numbers are.
[8275.20 → 8275.64] That's absurd.
[8275.78 → 8276.58] One of the things
[8276.58 → 8277.24] that I've pushed
[8277.24 → 8277.78] really hard
[8277.78 → 8278.68] about our newsletters
[8278.68 → 8279.86] is that we don't
[8279.86 → 8280.58] spam people.
[8280.72 → 8281.38] We like send
[8281.38 → 8282.28] meaningful
[8282.28 → 8283.44] newsletters
[8283.44 → 8284.28] so that they're good.
[8284.36 → 8284.84] We also saw
[8284.84 → 8286.24] very, very little
[8286.24 → 8286.94] abandonment
[8286.94 → 8288.06] or like
[8288.06 → 8289.64] a deregistration
[8289.64 → 8290.36] from our newsletters.
[8290.50 → 8290.62] So
[8290.62 → 8292.94] yeah, let's go.
[8293.62 → 8296.70] Challenges.
[8297.98 → 8299.24] Oh, we had some
[8299.24 → 8300.04] promotions of our
[8300.04 → 8300.92] products go live
[8300.92 → 8301.58] with influencers
[8301.58 → 8302.38] for stuff that we
[8302.38 → 8303.16] didn't have in stock.
[8303.26 → 8303.80] That was funny.
[8303.94 → 8305.34] That's one of our
[8305.34 → 8305.84] challenges.
[8306.62 → 8307.12] But that just
[8307.12 → 8307.98] it was what it was.
[8308.04 → 8308.96] The timing was what it was.
[8309.02 → 8309.74] We wanted to sponsor
[8309.74 → 8310.62] these creators anyway
[8310.62 → 8311.62] so we don't see that
[8311.62 → 8312.24] as a huge deal
[8312.24 → 8312.80] even though we
[8312.80 → 8313.52] obviously could have
[8313.52 → 8314.38] sold a bit more stuff
[8314.38 → 8315.10] if it was in stock.
[8315.10 → 8319.08] I think we moved
[8319.08 → 8320.72] through about
[8320.72 → 8322.64] I don't want to
[8322.64 → 8323.64] give this to you guys
[8323.64 → 8324.76] wrong, so I'm going to
[8324.76 → 8325.52] say I think
[8325.52 → 8326.64] we moved through
[8326.64 → 8328.40] about 20,000
[8328.40 → 8329.22] screwdrivers.
[8329.78 → 8330.98] Euro Satsuma
[8330.98 → 8332.00] in Full Plane Chat
[8332.00 → 8333.14] said normal open rate
[8333.14 → 8334.34] is about 10%
[8334.34 → 8335.08] and click through
[8335.08 → 8336.10] is 1%.
[8336.10 → 8337.14] Yeah.
[8337.64 → 8338.56] Also Bel track said
[8338.56 → 8339.60] 18% is meh
[8339.60 → 8340.24] and that's just
[8340.24 → 8341.14] not true.
[8341.14 → 8341.72] Actually stupid.
[8341.98 → 8342.60] And what are you
[8342.60 → 8342.80] doing?
[8342.92 → 8343.28] Sorry.
[8344.06 → 8344.44] Sorry.
[8344.60 → 8345.10] What's your click
[8345.10 → 8345.38] and open?
[8346.20 → 8347.56] Oh for Black Friday
[8347.56 → 8348.14] Cyber Monday.
[8348.38 → 8349.58] Open was 58
[8349.58 → 8351.14] and click was 18.
[8351.28 → 8351.46] Yeah.
[8351.76 → 8352.00] Yeah.
[8352.16 → 8353.94] So that's insane.
[8354.06 → 8354.78] More than half
[8354.78 → 8356.04] of a marketing email
[8356.04 → 8357.06] sent out was opened.
[8357.30 → 8358.26] That's nutting to me.
[8358.32 → 8359.64] That is completely
[8359.64 → 8361.20] obliterating
[8361.20 → 8362.30] like industry
[8362.30 → 8363.82] industry standard numbers.
[8366.64 → 8367.16] Yeah.
[8367.34 → 8368.26] Mystery Screwdriver
[8368.26 → 8370.38] was a huge success
[8370.38 → 8371.60] so we moved through
[8371.60 → 8373.78] some inventory
[8373.78 → 8374.58] of screwdriver
[8374.58 → 8375.24] colourways
[8375.24 → 8376.02] that were not
[8376.02 → 8377.24] selling particularly well.
[8377.50 → 8378.28] What was really
[8378.28 → 8379.18] surprising to me
[8379.18 → 8379.82] about the event
[8379.82 → 8381.92] was the aftermath.
[8382.50 → 8383.56] I was expecting
[8383.56 → 8385.48] a huge hangover
[8385.48 → 8387.50] on LTT store sales.
[8388.06 → 8388.90] Not so much?
[8389.04 → 8389.46] It didn't.
[8389.62 → 8390.14] No.
[8390.26 → 8391.22] It just didn't happen.
[8391.40 → 8391.62] Oh.
[8392.08 → 8392.38] Like we
[8392.38 → 8393.80] as soon as the sale
[8393.80 → 8394.28] ended
[8394.28 → 8396.36] sales were as good
[8396.36 → 8396.92] or better
[8396.92 → 8397.96] than before the event
[8397.96 → 8398.40] started
[8398.40 → 8399.30] which I
[8399.30 → 8399.92] and then they've
[8399.92 → 8400.64] been kind of like
[8400.64 → 8401.68] creeping kind of like
[8401.68 → 8402.80] up since then.
[8402.88 → 8403.32] It's just I guess
[8403.32 → 8403.76] like just
[8403.76 → 8404.04] That's wild.
[8404.38 → 8404.80] Just people
[8404.80 → 8405.78] in the shopping
[8405.78 → 8406.74] mood.
[8407.02 → 8407.34] I mean
[8407.34 → 8408.90] It is that time of year.
[8409.04 → 8409.90] One thing that was funky
[8409.90 → 8411.02] was that Black Friday
[8411.02 → 8413.88] was really late
[8413.88 → 8414.24] this year.
[8414.46 → 8414.88] It was like
[8414.88 → 8415.86] almost as late
[8415.86 → 8416.86] as it can be.
[8417.20 → 8417.60] So I think
[8417.60 → 8418.10] there's just been
[8418.10 → 8419.10] a lot of pent-up
[8419.10 → 8421.14] like shopping
[8421.14 → 8422.08] that people
[8422.08 → 8422.94] just weren't doing
[8422.94 → 8423.36] because they were
[8423.36 → 8423.78] kind of waiting
[8423.78 → 8424.46] on Black Friday
[8424.46 → 8425.30] to go.
[8426.18 → 8426.54] So anyway
[8426.54 → 8427.08] there's a little bit
[8427.08 → 8427.86] of inside baseball
[8427.86 → 8428.38] you guys.
[8428.58 → 8429.48] Baden 428
[8429.48 → 8430.14] in full plain chat
[8430.14 → 8431.04] said 58%
[8431.04 → 8432.24] is borderline SUS.
[8432.44 → 8432.80] Congrats.
[8432.92 → 8433.52] And honestly
[8433.52 → 8434.92] that's where I keep
[8434.92 → 8435.88] getting stuck onto it.
[8436.84 → 8437.64] I don't really
[8437.64 → 8438.88] do you opening
[8438.88 → 8439.22] marketing
[8439.22 → 8439.98] like how did we get
[8439.98 → 8441.32] over half of people
[8441.32 → 8442.04] to open a marketing
[8442.04 → 8442.92] email?
[8443.00 → 8443.84] Because it's perfect.
[8443.92 → 8444.50] They're good deals.
[8444.68 → 8445.78] What do you want from me?
[8445.84 → 8446.94] People were buying backpacks
[8446.94 → 8447.76] that came with a keyboard
[8447.76 → 8448.12] in it.
[8448.42 → 8449.10] That's pretty cool.
[8449.16 → 8449.98] Like what do you want from me?
[8450.04 → 8450.66] That's pretty cool.
[8451.00 → 8451.86] I already gave you a keyboard.
[8451.86 → 8452.56] Did it come in the back?
[8452.56 → 8452.90] No.
[8453.18 → 8453.60] Oh man.
[8453.68 → 8454.78] No it shipped separately.
[8455.16 → 8455.56] That would have been
[8455.56 → 8456.66] such a pain to do.
[8456.78 → 8457.74] I have actually
[8457.74 → 8458.20] Oh my goodness.
[8458.46 → 8459.86] I have actually pitched
[8459.86 → 8460.80] like maybe
[8460.80 → 8462.02] someday
[8462.02 → 8463.46] if we
[8463.46 → 8464.50] discontinued
[8464.50 → 8464.98] the backpack
[8464.98 → 8466.16] and we only had
[8466.16 → 8467.36] like a handful left
[8467.36 → 8468.62] doing like
[8468.62 → 8470.20] a loot box
[8470.20 → 8470.74] sale
[8470.74 → 8471.92] where you buy
[8471.92 → 8472.10] a backpack
[8472.10 → 8472.58] Your products might show up
[8472.58 → 8473.04] in a backpack.
[8473.08 → 8474.00] No, no you buy a backpack
[8474.00 → 8475.32] and then
[8475.32 → 8476.56] the staff
[8476.56 → 8477.60] at Creator Warehouse
[8477.60 → 8478.48] like inventory
[8478.48 → 8479.42] just like
[8479.42 → 8481.04] put a bunch of stuff in it
[8481.04 → 8481.60] as much stuff
[8481.60 → 8482.24] that fits in it
[8482.24 → 8483.02] and just ship it.
[8483.34 → 8483.48] Wow.
[8483.64 → 8484.36] And just like you get
[8484.36 → 8485.02] whatever's in it.
[8485.08 → 8485.40] I don't know.
[8485.72 → 8486.92] The logistics of doing
[8486.92 → 8487.50] something like that
[8487.50 → 8488.34] are completely stupid.
[8488.96 → 8489.16] But
[8489.16 → 8490.32] But okay.
[8490.46 → 8490.64] Here's
[8490.64 → 8491.42] It's pretty funny.
[8491.54 → 8492.04] Here's an additional
[8492.04 → 8492.76] part of my argument.
[8492.92 → 8493.06] Like
[8493.06 → 8494.48] I have a feeling
[8494.48 → 8495.22] a lot of people
[8495.22 → 8496.78] are just like
[8496.78 → 8497.78] auto filtering
[8497.78 → 8499.42] newsletters even.
[8499.96 → 8501.32] Like 58% open rate
[8501.32 → 8502.70] is crazy.
[8502.88 → 8503.92] But we specifically
[8503.92 → 8505.44] drove people to sign up
[8505.44 → 8506.42] for this communication.
[8506.56 → 8507.30] Like that's part of
[8507.30 → 8508.58] our communication philosophy
[8508.58 → 8509.42] is that we are not
[8509.42 → 8510.18] sending people anything
[8510.18 → 8510.88] they don't want.
[8511.18 → 8511.80] So that's why
[8511.80 → 8513.20] the regular newsletter
[8513.20 → 8515.10] I've stressed to the team
[8515.10 → 8516.20] that it's supposed
[8516.20 → 8516.88] to be content
[8516.88 → 8518.32] and any promotional materials
[8518.32 → 8518.86] need to live
[8518.86 → 8520.12] alongside content.
[8520.20 → 8520.92] It's opt-in only.
[8521.08 → 8521.52] Yeah okay.
[8521.58 → 8522.52] And then when it comes
[8522.52 → 8523.68] to our heavy promo
[8523.68 → 8524.88] newsletters
[8524.88 → 8526.20] we used to
[8526.20 → 8527.00] have it set up
[8527.00 → 8527.64] so that you were
[8527.64 → 8528.50] only signing up
[8528.50 → 8529.34] for that event
[8529.34 → 8530.18] and that event only.
[8530.40 → 8531.74] We changed our T's and C's
[8531.74 → 8532.48] so that now
[8532.48 → 8533.10] it's our like
[8533.10 → 8534.58] heavy promo newsletter list.
[8534.90 → 8536.16] But that newsletter list
[8536.16 → 8536.84] is
[8536.84 → 8537.96] is still
[8537.96 → 8538.86] we still treat it
[8538.86 → 8539.78] as sacred.
[8540.34 → 8541.36] It's a sacred cow.
[8541.46 → 8542.32] You don't slaughter it
[8542.32 → 8543.66] because it's tens
[8543.66 → 8544.72] of thousands of people
[8544.72 → 8546.24] with an open rate
[8546.24 → 8546.76] like that.
[8546.84 → 8547.58] It's crazy.
[8547.68 → 8547.86] Oh yeah.
[8547.92 → 8548.76] You don't screw that up.
[8548.84 → 8549.48] It's crazy.
[8549.76 → 8550.56] I think the reason
[8550.56 → 8551.20] why I'm reacting
[8551.20 → 8551.86] the way that I am
[8551.86 → 8552.26] is because
[8552.26 → 8553.06] especially
[8553.06 → 8554.52] I think more than ever
[8554.52 → 8555.68] this holiday season
[8555.68 → 8556.34] when I bought
[8556.34 → 8557.08] Christmas gifts
[8557.08 → 8558.46] stores just started
[8558.46 → 8559.80] spamming me.
[8560.00 → 8560.04] Yeah.
[8560.08 → 8560.96] Like there was one store
[8560.96 → 8561.78] that the day
[8561.78 → 8562.50] I bought something
[8562.50 → 8563.46] I got four to five
[8563.46 → 8564.10] emails from them.
[8564.20 → 8564.34] Yeah.
[8564.34 → 8565.14] And oh people
[8565.14 → 8565.78] they violate
[8565.78 → 8566.94] the crap out of
[8566.94 → 8567.36] canned spam.
[8567.64 → 8568.50] Incredibly not okay.
[8568.52 → 8569.62] Because like we have
[8569.62 → 8570.86] a supposedly
[8570.86 → 8571.92] super strong
[8571.92 → 8572.98] anti-spam laws
[8572.98 → 8573.52] here in Canada
[8573.52 → 8574.12] but apparently
[8574.12 → 8574.82] there's just no
[8574.82 → 8575.28] enforcement.
[8575.46 → 8575.98] Like I was getting
[8575.98 → 8576.70] text messages
[8576.70 → 8577.24] emails
[8577.24 → 8578.26] from companies
[8578.26 → 8578.94] I haven't engaged
[8578.94 → 8579.74] with in ages.
[8580.14 → 8581.08] Delta Force Paintball
[8581.08 → 8581.70] who I left that
[8581.70 → 8582.88] one-star review for
[8582.88 → 8584.12] sent me a bunch of stuff
[8584.12 → 8584.78] just like
[8584.78 → 8585.60] f*** you guys.
[8585.96 → 8586.00] Yeah.
[8587.64 → 8588.28] But yeah
[8588.28 → 8588.84] no we
[8588.84 → 8590.50] are not
[8590.50 → 8591.42] into that.
[8592.28 → 8593.28] And that doesn't mean
[8593.28 → 8594.14] we'll never do like
[8594.14 → 8594.90] a card abandonment
[8594.90 → 8595.74] email here and there
[8595.74 → 8596.44] or whatever else
[8596.44 → 8597.46] but when it comes to
[8597.46 → 8598.28] like our promotional
[8598.28 → 8599.28] newsletters
[8599.28 → 8600.44] if you get an email
[8600.44 → 8601.14] from LTT store
[8601.14 → 8602.12] I want you to be like
[8602.12 → 8602.56] ooh
[8602.56 → 8604.68] something good
[8604.68 → 8605.30] could be in there.
[8605.60 → 8605.70] Yeah.
[8606.30 → 8607.12] We work hard.
[8607.38 → 8608.30] We work hard for that.
[8608.54 → 8609.10] Someone asked
[8609.10 → 8609.74] this is an interesting
[8609.74 → 8610.08] question.
[8610.18 → 8610.52] I don't know why
[8610.52 → 8611.20] I haven't dived down
[8611.20 → 8612.20] this rabbit hole before
[8612.20 → 8614.08] but Ry saw said
[8614.08 → 8614.68] how do you measure
[8614.68 → 8615.82] that an email was opened?
[8616.26 → 8617.04] So we're not doing
[8617.04 → 8617.48] the measuring
[8617.48 → 8618.12] it would be some type
[8618.12 → 8618.92] of analytics tool.
[8619.06 → 8620.16] I'm assuming that
[8620.16 → 8620.70] what they're doing
[8620.70 → 8621.32] is there's like
[8621.32 → 8622.24] a picture in there
[8622.24 → 8623.24] and when the picture
[8623.24 → 8624.26] is served to you
[8624.26 → 8626.52] they know?
[8626.74 → 8626.90] I don't know.
[8627.02 → 8627.12] It's a whole thing.
[8627.12 → 8627.60] But honestly
[8627.60 → 8628.14] I don't know.
[8628.28 → 8628.90] Yeah it's a whole thing.
[8629.40 → 8630.22] Yeah I've never
[8630.22 → 8630.92] I've never actually
[8630.92 → 8630.94] listened to that.
[8630.94 → 8631.22] A hidden pixel
[8631.22 → 8632.28] correct says Zoe.
[8632.44 → 8632.90] Yeah okay.
[8633.20 → 8633.40] Yeah.
[8633.50 → 8634.04] Yeah yeah yeah.
[8636.18 → 8636.90] Yeah okay.
[8637.86 → 8638.56] It's just a pixel
[8638.56 → 8639.16] not a picture.
[8639.30 → 8639.56] Okay.
[8640.30 → 8640.74] Trackers.
[8640.90 → 8641.54] Let's go.
[8642.02 → 8642.22] Yeah.
[8642.30 → 8642.96] Alright Dan.
[8643.58 → 8644.26] Makes sense.
[8644.38 → 8644.84] It's just I never
[8644.84 → 8645.34] thought about it.
[8646.16 → 8646.94] Hi LLD.
[8647.20 → 8648.30] I started a new job
[8648.30 → 8649.68] as tech support manager
[8649.68 → 8651.52] at a small streaming service.
[8651.66 → 8651.98] Oh cool.
[8652.24 → 8653.20] I just got tasked
[8653.20 → 8655.02] with also managing inventory
[8655.02 → 8656.54] shipping and receiving
[8656.54 → 8657.88] and I'm having trouble
[8657.88 → 8658.86] finding balance.
[8659.18 → 8659.98] Any advice?
[8660.26 → 8661.34] You have two jobs.
[8661.72 → 8662.44] At least two.
[8663.78 → 8665.28] Dramatically different ones too.
[8665.40 → 8666.26] Yeah I think
[8666.26 → 8668.48] I think there needs
[8668.48 → 8669.84] to be an honest conversation
[8669.84 → 8671.18] about getting you
[8671.18 → 8671.88] more resources
[8671.88 → 8673.36] because you can't
[8673.36 → 8674.42] really find balance
[8674.42 → 8675.86] when you have two jobs.
[8676.20 → 8677.24] I mean based on that
[8677.24 → 8678.28] they're a small streaming service
[8678.28 → 8679.12] it sounds like they're
[8679.12 → 8680.46] probably a small company
[8680.46 → 8681.36] but
[8681.36 → 8683.80] yeah I think
[8683.80 → 8684.40] you should basically
[8684.40 → 8684.82] tell them
[8684.82 → 8685.18] well look
[8685.18 → 8686.06] here's the situation
[8686.06 → 8686.92] I have two jobs
[8686.92 → 8687.74] do I have two times
[8687.74 → 8688.26] the salary
[8688.26 → 8688.98] and obviously
[8688.98 → 8689.74] you can't present it
[8689.74 → 8690.64] in exactly that way
[8690.64 → 8692.22] but there needs to be
[8692.22 → 8693.02] sort of plan.
[8693.20 → 8693.84] Can we put together
[8693.84 → 8694.38] a roadmap
[8694.38 → 8695.46] where either
[8695.46 → 8696.34] my workload
[8696.34 → 8697.10] stabilizes
[8697.10 → 8698.56] to something
[8698.56 → 8699.54] resembling one
[8699.54 → 8700.54] you know
[8700.54 → 8701.48] role
[8701.48 → 8703.74] or is there going to be
[8703.74 → 8704.26] some kind of
[8704.26 → 8705.30] compensation adjustment
[8705.30 → 8706.22] as I
[8706.22 → 8707.52] do I have any
[8707.52 → 8708.48] do I have approval
[8708.48 → 8709.48] to hire resources
[8709.48 → 8710.60] to help to balance this
[8710.60 → 8710.96] like what
[8710.96 → 8712.32] what is our plan
[8712.32 → 8713.20] to get things
[8713.20 → 8714.06] to some semblance
[8714.06 → 8714.80] of normal
[8714.80 → 8715.96] or will I literally
[8715.96 → 8716.52] be given
[8716.52 → 8717.48] double the compensation
[8717.48 → 8718.68] to work twice as many hours
[8718.68 → 8719.28] because these are
[8719.28 → 8719.90] these are the only
[8719.90 → 8720.54] three paths
[8720.54 → 8721.64] that are going to get us to
[8721.64 → 8723.44] or the quality of both
[8723.44 → 8724.28] is just going to suffer
[8724.28 → 8725.62] and like I think
[8725.62 → 8726.62] I think mentioning
[8726.62 → 8727.36] that bit
[8727.36 → 8728.98] being like basically
[8728.98 → 8729.70] inevitably
[8729.70 → 8731.24] this is going to happen
[8731.24 → 8732.12] like I'm doing my best
[8732.12 → 8733.36] I'm doing my best
[8733.36 → 8734.34] I care about my job
[8734.34 → 8735.30] I'm working hard
[8735.30 → 8737.16] but I am
[8737.16 → 8738.90] I am frustrated
[8738.90 → 8739.50] one of these plates is going to fall
[8739.50 → 8740.66] yeah I am frustrated
[8740.66 → 8741.60] by the fact that
[8741.60 → 8742.72] I don't have the time
[8742.72 → 8743.32] to do things
[8743.32 → 8744.28] to the level of quality
[8744.28 → 8744.90] that I believe
[8744.90 → 8745.86] got me this promotion
[8745.86 → 8746.66] in the first place
[8746.66 → 8746.96] yeah
[8746.96 → 8748.42] and I think that'll be
[8748.42 → 8748.88] a disappointment
[8748.88 → 8749.60] to both of us
[8749.60 → 8749.80] you know
[8749.80 → 8750.52] frame it as a
[8750.52 → 8751.44] help me help you
[8751.44 → 8751.84] yeah
[8751.84 → 8754.24] good advice Linus
[8754.24 → 8755.90] thanks
[8755.90 → 8756.32] wow
[8756.32 → 8757.76] there's a change
[8757.76 → 8758.60] you've done this for a while
[8758.60 → 8759.10] yeah
[8759.10 → 8760.08] it's almost like
[8760.08 → 8760.88] I've had conversations
[8760.88 → 8761.40] with people
[8761.40 → 8761.88] who are wearing
[8761.88 → 8762.58] too many hats
[8762.58 → 8763.18] recently
[8763.18 → 8767.90] Nick from the lab
[8767.90 → 8769.32] yeah that's crazy
[8769.32 → 8769.86] how many titles
[8769.86 → 8770.44] do you have Luke
[8770.44 → 8773.76] three of them
[8773.76 → 8776.16] hi LTT
[8776.16 → 8777.80] do you guys know
[8777.80 → 8778.78] if the LTT water bottle
[8778.78 → 8779.50] has any type of
[8779.50 → 8780.22] synthetic coating
[8780.22 → 8780.98] or lining
[8780.98 → 8781.90] on the bottle interior
[8781.90 → 8783.26] the gloss around the mouth
[8783.26 → 8784.14] of the bottle
[8784.14 → 8785.80] seems almost unnatural
[8785.80 → 8788.06] not that I'm aware of
[8788.06 → 8789.06] the gloss
[8789.06 → 8789.76] around the
[8789.76 → 8790.14] what
[8790.14 → 8791.12] is it just polished
[8791.12 → 8791.54] oh
[8791.54 → 8792.32] yeah that's just
[8792.32 → 8793.04] polished middle bro
[8793.04 → 8794.16] yeah
[8794.16 → 8794.90] just looks nice
[8794.90 → 8795.16] yeah
[8795.16 → 8796.06] all good
[8796.06 → 8796.82] if it's stamped
[8796.82 → 8797.34] that might be
[8797.34 → 8798.00] from the tool
[8798.00 → 8800.04] oh
[8800.04 → 8802.30] like injection moulding
[8802.30 → 8802.84] the uh
[8802.84 → 8803.98] surface finish
[8803.98 → 8805.26] uh
[8805.26 → 8806.16] next up is for Luke
[8806.16 → 8807.70] I'm a business owner
[8807.70 → 8809.10] starting a custom
[8809.10 → 8809.90] software project
[8809.90 → 8811.12] and hired a full-time
[8811.12 → 8812.78] recent graduate dev
[8812.78 → 8813.94] how do I ensure
[8813.94 → 8815.02] he's making progress
[8815.02 → 8815.78] on the projects
[8815.78 → 8816.26] and not playing
[8816.26 → 8817.00] Starfield all day
[8817.00 → 8818.86] well
[8818.86 → 8820.16] you shouldn't have
[8820.16 → 8820.70] hired him if you
[8820.70 → 8821.62] play Starfield at all
[8821.62 → 8822.48] oh
[8822.48 → 8824.28] um
[8824.28 → 8826.22] uh
[8826.22 → 8826.54] do
[8826.54 → 8827.24] do check-ins
[8827.24 → 8828.20] ask to see progress
[8828.20 → 8828.88] there's a difference
[8828.88 → 8830.06] between something in
[8830.06 → 8830.86] prod and something
[8830.86 → 8831.84] in like a local
[8831.84 → 8832.36] environment
[8832.36 → 8833.12] get him to show you
[8833.12 → 8833.94] what's in his
[8833.94 → 8834.60] local environment
[8834.60 → 8835.24] what he's touching
[8835.24 → 8835.68] at the time
[8835.68 → 8836.68] that doesn't mean
[8836.68 → 8837.22] it's going to be
[8837.22 → 8838.10] actually necessarily
[8838.10 → 8838.82] close to ready
[8838.82 → 8839.92] again I just said
[8839.92 → 8840.44] there's a difference
[8840.44 → 8840.94] between what's in
[8840.94 → 8841.66] the local environment
[8841.66 → 8842.38] and what's in prod
[8842.38 → 8844.22] do not go down
[8844.22 → 8845.26] the route of trying
[8845.26 → 8846.78] to count lines of
[8846.78 → 8848.00] code or
[8848.00 → 8849.68] things like that
[8849.68 → 8850.56] but there's also
[8850.56 → 8851.62] no reason for someone
[8851.62 → 8852.64] to have no commits
[8852.64 → 8853.08] in a week
[8853.08 → 8853.88] um
[8853.88 → 8854.36] like there's
[8854.36 → 8854.80] there's different
[8854.80 → 8855.34] things that you can
[8855.34 → 8855.94] kind of look at
[8855.94 → 8856.86] there are
[8856.86 → 8858.14] you could have
[8858.14 → 8858.84] a developer on your
[8858.84 → 8859.62] staff that works
[8859.62 → 8860.34] in the negatives
[8860.34 → 8861.32] in regard to lines
[8861.32 → 8861.98] of code who is
[8861.98 → 8862.52] potentially your
[8862.52 → 8863.54] most valuable person
[8863.54 → 8864.30] uh
[8864.30 → 8864.92] lines of code is
[8864.92 → 8865.52] a bad metric
[8865.52 → 8866.50] um
[8866.50 → 8868.92] and you hired
[8868.92 → 8869.50] a new grad
[8869.50 → 8871.44] so expect them
[8871.44 → 8872.06] to need learning
[8872.06 → 8872.40] time
[8872.40 → 8873.24] um
[8873.24 → 8874.28] ask them be
[8874.28 → 8875.04] be communicative
[8875.04 → 8875.50] about what they're
[8875.50 → 8876.20] doing and if
[8876.20 → 8877.48] honestly if what
[8877.48 → 8877.94] they're doing is
[8877.94 → 8878.90] learning that might
[8878.90 → 8880.24] be legit um
[8880.24 → 8881.86] but talk to them
[8881.86 → 8882.18] about what they're
[8882.18 → 8883.32] learning like
[8883.32 → 8884.52] engage with them
[8884.52 → 8885.14] about what they're
[8885.14 → 8886.20] doing um
[8886.20 → 8887.88] care and pay
[8887.88 → 8888.62] attention and it
[8888.62 → 8889.02] should be fine
[8889.02 → 8894.58] if you could
[8894.58 → 8895.02] develop one
[8895.02 → 8895.84] LTT version of
[8895.84 → 8896.86] a core computer
[8896.86 → 8897.76] component CPU
[8897.76 → 8898.50] motherboard storage
[8898.50 → 8899.50] etc what would
[8899.50 → 8900.38] you pick and why
[8900.38 → 8900.90] motherboard
[8900.90 → 8903.34] yeah because it's
[8903.34 → 8904.42] like the most
[8904.42 → 8906.42] sort of visible one
[8906.42 → 8907.08] it would look cool
[8907.08 → 8907.98] I'd make a cool
[8907.98 → 8908.48] looking one
[8908.48 → 8909.04] I feel like you
[8909.04 → 8909.80] could also actually
[8909.80 → 8910.66] potentially have some
[8910.66 → 8911.40] impact there that is
[8911.40 → 8912.36] cool yeah like more
[8912.36 → 8913.50] PCI slots I don't
[8913.50 → 8913.90] think we're going to
[8913.90 → 8914.74] make a better GPU
[8914.74 → 8915.84] how about any PCIE
[8915.84 → 8917.84] slots oh please
[8917.84 → 8918.40] please
[8918.40 → 8923.20] hello Linus I have
[8923.20 → 8924.60] been extremely excited
[8924.60 → 8926.50] about LTT USB cables
[8926.50 → 8927.82] can you talk about
[8927.82 → 8928.44] anything that makes
[8928.44 → 8929.18] them stand out and
[8929.18 → 8930.00] what went into their
[8930.00 → 8932.48] development man we
[8932.48 → 8934.58] sourced cables from so
[8934.58 → 8935.46] many different
[8935.46 → 8937.32] manufacturers um we
[8937.32 → 8939.78] debated endlessly the
[8939.78 → 8941.44] validity of our
[8941.44 → 8943.84] product as uh as
[8943.84 → 8945.12] one that needs to
[8945.12 → 8946.42] exist I have pushed
[8946.42 → 8947.84] extremely hard for
[8947.84 → 8948.60] the creation of our
[8948.60 → 8949.94] cables they don't
[8949.94 → 8951.76] make any sense in
[8951.76 → 8953.16] the like current
[8953.16 → 8954.46] landscape because
[8954.46 → 8955.42] they're going to be
[8955.42 → 8957.62] expensive because um
[8957.62 → 8959.94] every individual
[8959.94 → 8961.76] conductor has its own
[8961.76 → 8962.70] shielding like they're a
[8962.70 → 8964.28] coaxial style cable
[8964.28 → 8965.16] rather than a twisted
[8965.16 → 8966.74] pair style cable oh
[8966.74 → 8969.18] which adds bulk which is
[8969.18 → 8970.80] not desirable yeah it's
[8970.80 → 8971.70] going to be really thick
[8971.70 → 8973.60] adds weight which is not
[8973.60 → 8974.74] desirable, and it adds
[8974.74 → 8975.94] stiffness which is not
[8975.94 → 8977.68] desirable however we're
[8977.68 → 8978.88] able to counter some of
[8978.88 → 8980.02] the stiffness by using
[8980.02 → 8981.32] like that really nice
[8981.32 → 8982.52] hobbyist grade like
[8982.52 → 8984.14] silicone outer
[8984.14 → 8986.56] sleeving yep um and
[8986.56 → 8988.16] what we get for going
[8988.16 → 8989.24] with a coaxial style
[8989.24 → 8991.68] cable is we get really
[8991.68 → 8993.50] great signal integrity
[8993.50 → 8994.56] and really great power
[8994.56 → 8995.70] delivery it'll still be
[8995.70 → 8996.30] cheaper than audio
[8996.30 → 8997.68] file cables, and it will
[8997.68 → 8998.48] still be cheaper than
[8998.48 → 8999.32] audio file cables and
[8999.32 → 8999.94] that's kind of that's
[8999.94 → 9000.64] kind of our whole thing
[9000.64 → 9001.90] is like we price things
[9001.90 → 9003.82] at what they cost to
[9003.82 → 9005.00] buy a premium product
[9005.00 → 9007.18] but not what people
[9007.18 → 9008.74] obviously are paying for
[9008.74 → 9010.16] snake oil luxury products
[9010.16 → 9011.30] but yeah it costs more
[9011.30 → 9012.56] than some like and you
[9012.56 → 9013.16] might not want that
[9013.16 → 9013.78] and that's cheap
[9013.78 → 9017.62] JFK XY tech cable on
[9017.62 → 9018.98] Amazon right so that's
[9018.98 → 9020.60] that's what we're making
[9020.60 → 9023.44] we are making really nice
[9023.44 → 9025.80] in spec cables with good
[9025.80 → 9027.24] signal integrity and good
[9027.24 → 9029.04] power ratings um and
[9029.04 → 9030.96] that's that's it that's
[9030.96 → 9031.82] all there is to it, we're
[9031.82 → 9032.68] not going to make any
[9032.68 → 9033.90] kind of claims that
[9033.90 → 9034.82] aren't true about them
[9034.82 → 9035.82] we are just going to
[9035.82 → 9037.06] tell you exactly what
[9037.06 → 9038.18] speed and what wattage
[9038.18 → 9039.30] they run at right on the
[9039.30 → 9041.92] connector that's it I'm
[9041.92 → 9045.24] very excited hi Wanda
[9045.24 → 9046.98] DLL are there any
[9046.98 → 9048.06] technologies that you
[9048.06 → 9049.12] thought would fail but
[9049.12 → 9050.54] were actually successful
[9050.54 → 9052.02] here's mine I thought
[9052.02 → 9054.06] dual slot GPUs were
[9054.06 → 9055.00] Jacky and would be
[9055.00 → 9056.00] rejected by the market
[9056.00 → 9057.62] but boy was I wrong
[9057.62 → 9062.88] um I thought that AI o
[9062.88 → 9064.34] coolers were kind of a
[9064.34 → 9066.36] gimmick but the thing
[9066.36 → 9068.36] that I underestimated was
[9068.36 → 9070.28] the aesthetic component of
[9070.28 → 9071.36] people posting showcase
[9071.36 → 9073.82] builds and especially i
[9073.82 → 9074.72] underestimated the
[9074.72 → 9075.96] importance of them in
[9075.96 → 9077.68] shipping systems yeah
[9077.68 → 9079.56] shipping an OCTU NHD 15
[9079.56 → 9081.02] in a completely built system
[9081.02 → 9082.94] is not a good idea period
[9082.94 → 9084.92] um and so you have to go
[9084.92 → 9087.08] all the way back to um
[9087.08 → 9091.80] the ace tech lc the
[9091.80 → 9093.60] low cost liquid cooling
[9093.60 → 9094.86] like it was originally
[9094.86 → 9096.12] developed as just like a
[9096.12 → 9099.68] cheapo like solution to
[9099.68 → 9102.34] to get something cooled um
[9102.34 → 9104.64] cheaply with water like it
[9104.64 → 9106.98] was not a premium product at
[9106.98 → 9109.64] all, so this is the original OEM
[9109.64 → 9112.38] ace tech version that pretty
[9112.38 → 9113.24] much everyone and their
[9113.24 → 9114.94] dog uh licenses because
[9114.94 → 9116.02] it's patented I think
[9116.02 → 9117.52] ace tech and then cool it
[9117.52 → 9118.56] own patents on it or
[9118.56 → 9119.70] something like that so
[9119.70 → 9120.72] unless you
[9120.72 → 9121.54] license from one of them
[9121.54 → 9122.48] or you found a workaround
[9122.48 → 9123.44] that's pretty much what
[9123.44 → 9124.56] you're stuck with and
[9124.56 → 9125.52] what's funny about it to
[9125.52 → 9127.48] me is that when the
[9127.48 → 9128.78] ace tech lc look at
[9128.78 → 9131.88] this when the lc
[9131.88 → 9134.44] launched um it was not
[9134.44 → 9135.78] particularly well received
[9135.78 → 9136.90] because it really like
[9136.90 → 9138.60] didn't perform that good
[9138.60 → 9140.22] so here's the lc
[9140.22 → 9141.78] compared to just like a
[9141.78 → 9145.52] basic like cooler um like
[9145.52 → 9146.86] what's a Silverstone nt06
[9146.86 → 9147.94] it's not Silverstone's not
[9147.94 → 9150.58] even like uh this is not a
[9150.58 → 9151.60] particularly well regarded
[9151.60 → 9152.44] cooler from a not
[9152.44 → 9153.72] particularly well regarded
[9153.72 → 9155.80] cooler brand okay this is the
[9155.80 → 9157.48] pro but whatever it's just
[9157.48 → 9159.38] like a basic not even tower
[9159.38 → 9160.52] cool like downdraft style
[9160.52 → 9163.00] cooler um so the lc is
[9163.00 → 9168.04] nothing special um like really
[9168.04 → 9170.60] at all, and then it wasn't
[9170.60 → 9173.12] until corsair well are they
[9173.12 → 9175.42] cooling a GPU uh I don't
[9175.42 → 9176.36] know I think they're
[9176.36 → 9177.40] cooling a GPU so it doesn't
[9177.40 → 9178.64] matter that that particular
[9178.64 → 9179.52] review they might have been
[9179.52 → 9180.38] but the point is that it
[9180.38 → 9181.56] didn't perform particularly
[9181.56 → 9183.28] well, and it wasn't until the
[9183.28 → 9184.98] corsair h50 came out that
[9184.98 → 9186.08] all of a sudden people got
[9186.08 → 9187.52] enthusiastic about it and i
[9187.52 → 9189.36] couldn't I still to this day
[9189.36 → 9192.50] have not really been able to
[9192.50 → 9193.88] figure out why people went
[9193.88 → 9196.64] from being so tepid about it
[9196.64 → 9199.38] to being impressed by it when
[9199.38 → 9202.04] all that was changed was that
[9202.04 → 9204.38] one of them was branded
[9204.38 → 9205.92] ace tech lc and one of them
[9205.92 → 9206.96] was branded corsair and you
[9206.96 → 9208.40] can actually see like the
[9208.40 → 9209.66] comparison is only against the
[9209.66 → 9210.78] stock cooler and even then
[9210.78 → 9213.54] um like it's obvious that if
[9213.54 → 9214.90] you just had like a decent
[9214.90 → 9216.40] cooler in here this would not
[9216.40 → 9219.02] look very impressive um i
[9219.02 → 9220.12] really think it was just
[9220.12 → 9222.84] nobody heard about it until it
[9222.84 → 9225.10] was corsair branded and then
[9225.10 → 9226.10] when it was corsair branded
[9226.10 → 9227.68] they're like I can have water
[9227.68 → 9228.98] cooling, and they didn't look at
[9228.98 → 9229.90] the graphs, and they just bought
[9229.90 → 9233.64] it yeah i I mean I guess but
[9233.64 → 9235.62] that that was basically how AI
[9235.62 → 9237.64] coolers started was as a
[9237.64 → 9239.44] complete nothingburger that no
[9239.44 → 9240.76] one kind of cared about other
[9240.76 → 9242.50] than that you could get your GPU
[9242.50 → 9244.54] temps down just kind of nice and
[9244.54 → 9247.20] then it turned into their high
[9247.20 → 9249.04] performance coolers and they
[9249.04 → 9250.98] have never at any point really
[9250.98 → 9253.18] outperformed high-end air
[9253.18 → 9255.40] coolers meaningfully for most
[9255.40 → 9256.86] people there are cases
[9256.86 → 9259.16] where like a triple AIO is going
[9259.16 → 9261.48] to outperform all but the
[9261.48 → 9264.48] gigantic is to bulkiest of
[9264.48 → 9267.44] air coolers but uh not much for
[9267.44 → 9269.74] me it was this isn't really it is
[9269.74 → 9271.14] a technology, but it's in a
[9271.14 → 9273.46] specific use case I guess the
[9273.46 → 9275.58] massive price jump that came with
[9275.58 → 9278.32] like addressable RGB fans I thought
[9278.32 → 9279.06] the community was going to be
[9279.06 → 9282.02] like I don't care oh, but they're
[9282.02 → 9284.38] because of the price I guess they
[9284.38 → 9286.38] cared they really did they cared
[9286.38 → 9288.66] hard 120 bucks for three fans like
[9288.66 → 9290.92] when I saw it I was like and then
[9290.92 → 9296.38] everybody bought it okay guess I am
[9296.38 → 9300.42] wrong sounds good Linus how do you
[9300.42 → 9302.52] manage your kids game time at home i
[9302.52 → 9304.24] find that the 30-minute rule doesn't
[9304.24 → 9305.50] work but I still want them to have
[9305.50 → 9308.60] fun um they earn game time for
[9308.60 → 9310.60] extracurricular activities so if they
[9310.60 → 9312.30] do I think it's an hour of
[9312.30 → 9314.08] extracurriculars they get 45 minutes
[9314.08 → 9315.30] of game time or something like that
[9315.30 → 9318.00] and then if they are buttheads or
[9318.00 → 9320.14] whatever then they lose game time
[9320.14 → 9321.84] they're like grounded from game
[9321.84 → 9324.00] time so pretty much like that
[9324.00 → 9326.90] dear Linus Dan and monsieur oh yeah
[9326.90 → 9328.50] go for it do you know if you blanket
[9329.04 → 9330.28] ground them from game time for a
[9330.28 → 9331.60] certain period of time do you notice a
[9331.60 → 9333.54] reduction in the activities that earn
[9333.54 → 9336.34] them game time um no not really
[9336.34 → 9338.62] that's cool yeah they're pretty good
[9338.62 → 9340.70] kids actually my kids are mostly not
[9340.70 → 9343.70] buttheads cool sorry keep going no uh
[9343.70 → 9345.06] dear Linus Dan and monsieur LE
[9345.06 → 9348.12] fernier external drives will list an USB
[9348.12 → 9350.48] speed and a drive speed for example we
[9350.48 → 9352.08] could have 10 gigabits per second and
[9352.08 → 9354.48] 3500 megabytes per second how do we
[9354.48 → 9355.86] know which one is actually the drive
[9355.86 → 9361.80] speed uh the one that is five gigabit
[9361.80 → 9363.86] per second or 10 gigabits per second is
[9363.86 → 9366.28] the USB speed and the other one is the
[9366.28 → 9369.22] drive speed that's a perfect
[9369.22 → 9371.02] question never even like occurred to me
[9371.02 → 9372.40] that if you have no context for these
[9372.40 → 9373.64] numbers you'd have no way of knowing
[9373.64 → 9377.06] which is which um i never really
[9377.06 → 9378.86] thought about it before but yeah it's
[9378.86 → 9381.04] also I can see how okay those
[9381.04 → 9382.52] particular numbers are obviously
[9382.52 → 9385.58] conflicting because 3500 megabytes a
[9385.58 → 9387.96] second would be like three and a half
[9387.96 → 9390.70] or like four gigabits or 40 gigabits or
[9390.70 → 9392.32] something like that like it's not like
[9392.32 → 9393.80] those numbers are not would not be on
[9393.80 → 9395.92] the same package, but that's a PCI gen
[9395.92 → 9398.12] 4 NVMe drive right something like that
[9398.12 → 9399.36] pretty much yeah yeah
[9399.36 → 9404.20] um what can a newbie data engineer do
[9404.20 → 9407.08] to better help the team this past year my
[9407.08 → 9408.64] name has been sent to different teams on
[9408.64 → 9411.12] the project to be of help only to be
[9411.12 → 9413.18] ignored or rejected for inexperience
[9413.18 → 9416.60] jump in
[9416.60 → 9420.88] look through the code base try to see if
[9420.88 → 9423.02] there are things you can help with attend
[9423.02 → 9426.24] the meetings um be ready to accept that
[9426.24 → 9427.78] if you like kind of suck and aren't ready
[9427.78 → 9429.48] to contribute that you need to find more
[9429.48 → 9431.70] experience ask people what you should do
[9431.70 → 9433.54] to pursue that experience if they're not
[9433.54 → 9435.18] giving you think listen in the meetings
[9435.18 → 9436.58] to the things that people don't want to
[9436.58 → 9439.56] do and then try to grab those that's
[9439.56 → 9443.06] such key career advice like be the
[9443.06 → 9444.72] indispensable person who does the stuff
[9444.72 → 9446.68] that no one else wants to do and
[9446.68 → 9448.68] don't be stuck there forever yeah it's
[9448.68 → 9450.80] just uh you're you're working on
[9450.80 → 9452.78] becoming liked on a team like people
[9452.78 → 9454.40] want you to be on the team and then you
[9454.40 → 9456.86] know you can try to ditch the garbage
[9456.86 → 9460.20] jobs eventually um a common one is if you
[9460.20 → 9462.10] have if your team has some amount of code
[9462.10 → 9464.82] coverage basically no one likes doing
[9464.82 → 9466.78] code coverage so if you volunteer to do
[9466.78 → 9468.20] some of the code coverage and then you
[9468.20 → 9471.36] don't do a horrible job of it most people
[9471.36 → 9472.84] in my experience would like that if is
[9472.84 → 9474.62] they do have a requirement of doing code
[9474.62 → 9476.78] coverage not everyone does for
[9476.78 → 9477.90] for tests to be clear
[9477.90 → 9483.54] more yeah the first comment I see in
[9483.54 → 9485.06] response that is code coverage sucks
[9485.06 → 9488.86] exactly so volunteer to do that do their
[9488.86 → 9492.64] documentation yeah like this is yeah if
[9492.64 → 9494.74] you make one of their lives like way
[9494.74 → 9496.42] better due to you being on the team
[9496.42 → 9497.48] they're probably going to want you there
[9497.48 → 9501.08] more uh, and then you know eventually you
[9501.08 → 9503.26] work up to being a peer instead of just
[9503.26 → 9504.78] doing their dirty work it's also a cheat
[9504.78 → 9506.12] code to understand what they're doing
[9506.12 → 9510.78] yeah yeah hello DLL from Scotland
[9510.78 → 9513.32] making a tricky question to answer but
[9513.32 → 9516.18] when doing collaboration videos like the
[9516.18 → 9518.16] one with electro boom how do you typically
[9518.16 → 9520.68] split the video revenue love the show oh
[9520.68 → 9524.20] that's a good question um so I read this in
[9524.20 → 9525.30] advance so I already have this ready
[9525.30 → 9527.44] there we've done a few collabs with
[9527.44 → 9529.94] electro boom media is amazing the first
[9529.94 → 9533.60] one we did was can static kill your pc and
[9533.60 → 9536.46] in this case we uploaded our video which
[9536.46 → 9539.26] was edited by our editors and shot by our
[9539.26 → 9542.22] camera operators and scripted by our
[9542.22 → 9545.34] writers and uh we kept 100 of the
[9545.34 → 9548.66] revenue from that and media normal uploaded
[9548.66 → 9551.32] this video which was his separate video
[9551.32 → 9555.30] kind of featuring um me as a talent in
[9555.30 → 9557.20] the video as well but with his own writing
[9557.20 → 9559.56] his own editing, and he kept 100 of the
[9559.56 → 9563.32] revenue from that so it is a tricky thing
[9563.32 → 9565.28] because it's kind of unspoken like nobody
[9565.28 → 9567.10] really wants to be the one that's like hey
[9567.10 → 9570.12] who gets the money when you work together on
[9570.12 → 9572.16] a collab I think by and large the YouTube
[9572.16 → 9574.62] creator community is beneficial for both
[9574.62 → 9579.16] is pretty um is pretty uh
[9579.16 → 9585.94] common good minded you know pretty
[9585.94 → 9587.66] magnanimous about the way that they approach
[9587.66 → 9590.66] collabing is an inherently win-win
[9590.66 → 9592.84] thing or at least it's supposed to be
[9592.84 → 9595.72] there have been cases that have not been
[9595.72 → 9597.60] yeah I'm sure yeah I mean what I was gonna
[9597.60 → 9599.10] say was I'm sure there are exceptions to the
[9599.10 → 9602.34] rule but honestly in all the experience I've
[9602.34 → 9604.66] had seeing this both externally and
[9604.66 → 9607.40] internally yeah no I don't think anyone's
[9607.40 → 9609.76] even asked ever but I mean one of the
[9609.76 → 9611.42] things that I go out of my way to ask is
[9611.42 → 9613.20] like hey uh you know what do you need out
[9613.20 → 9615.44] of this um yeah oh absolutely do you need
[9615.44 → 9617.68] me to be available to help you with a
[9617.68 → 9620.12] video like Ludwig for example he just like
[9620.12 → 9621.80] came up here he wanted absolutely nothing
[9621.80 → 9624.12] in return I'm like okay, and you know but
[9624.12 → 9625.72] can we do something but when he called me
[9625.72 → 9627.50] up for to do bro versus bro I'm like yeah
[9627.50 → 9629.88] bro I'm there you know so
[9629.88 → 9632.92] so yeah so there's kind of this there's
[9632.92 → 9634.26] kind of unspoken
[9634.26 → 9637.86] hey did this transaction make sense for
[9637.86 → 9639.70] everybody okay it's tied to neat little
[9639.70 → 9641.84] bow nobody really owes anybody else a
[9641.84 → 9644.30] solid, but there's also an unspoken hey
[9644.30 → 9646.00] that really benefited one of us more than
[9646.00 → 9647.76] the other does it do either of us kind
[9647.76 → 9648.82] of owe the other a solid
[9648.82 → 9654.28] um so the wireless ESD straps
[9654.28 → 9656.40] met just was like thrilled with the first
[9656.40 → 9658.08] collab and loved it and just was like yeah i
[9658.08 → 9660.96] want to come do another one um and so i
[9660.96 → 9662.96] kind of owed him a solid so when we were
[9662.96 → 9664.80] trying to do an upgrade for somebody and
[9664.80 → 9666.24] we were thinking of a creator that we'd
[9666.24 → 9668.80] love to do an upgrade for 10 months ago we
[9668.80 → 9670.40] were like oh why don't we do a tech
[9670.40 → 9672.40] makeover for met pretty local too which
[9672.40 → 9674.16] helps yeah so that was the way those
[9674.16 → 9676.00] ones worked we kept 100 of the money from
[9676.00 → 9677.92] these but met got a sick tech upgrade
[9677.92 → 9680.80] and very helpfully came and uh and some
[9680.80 → 9682.72] speed holes in his walls some of his fun
[9682.72 → 9684.64] gadgets for us to play with
[9684.64 → 9686.72] um and that's I think that's all the
[9686.72 → 9689.52] videos that we've collabed on
[9689.52 → 9692.24] yeah so met's super cool and is I think a
[9692.24 → 9696.32] perfect example of how without asking for
[9696.32 → 9698.56] anything he gives freely of his time and
[9698.56 → 9702.40] expertise and I would like to think we try to
[9702.40 → 9706.24] take a similar approach and everyone was
[9706.24 → 9708.80] happy as far as I know I mean we're still on
[9708.80 → 9710.88] speaking terms so yeah met him and his
[9710.88 → 9713.52] family down at open sauce super cool yeah
[9713.52 → 9716.32] so, so cool awesome people yeah, yeah just
[9716.32 → 9718.32] like actual good people that you should
[9718.32 → 9721.20] feel good about supporting yep
[9721.20 → 9725.04] hey Linus I like that you have a CPU tower
[9725.04 → 9727.44] in one room and runs of cable to three
[9727.44 → 9729.12] other rooms what is the current best
[9729.12 → 9731.20] cabling to run for this purpose previously
[9731.20 → 9736.24] you've run HDMI and USB 2.0 or 3.0 for this
[9736.24 → 9740.64] um I've been okay happy with my display
[9740.64 → 9743.12] port but I sometimes wish that I had run
[9743.12 → 9745.44] HDMI just because I find it can be a
[9745.44 → 9747.76] little less flaky about picking up a
[9747.76 → 9749.36] signal when the system's already running
[9749.36 → 9753.44] HDMI that is other than that man USB is
[9753.44 → 9756.16] tough um as long as you only need to USB
[9756.16 → 9758.64] 2 over Ethernet is fine but if you want to
[9758.64 → 9761.12] go really long distances over optical
[9761.12 → 9764.24] you have to use these like expensive uh media
[9764.24 → 9766.32] conversion kits and stuff, and it gets kind
[9766.32 → 9770.72] of it gets kind of tricky um
[9772.88 → 9774.16] how long did they say they were going
[9774.16 → 9777.68] again to three other rooms no that's what
[9777.68 → 9780.56] you do three other rooms previously
[9780.56 → 9782.64] I've run HDMI so what are your run
[9782.64 → 9785.04] links uh mine are in the neighbourhood of
[9785.04 → 9787.92] around 50 to 60 feet I think oh no I'm
[9787.92 → 9790.96] sorry I misinterpreted this I like you
[9790.96 → 9794.08] have my CPU tower in one room and runs of
[9794.08 → 9795.92] cable to three other rooms got it uh
[9795.92 → 9798.96] yeah best cabling is oh man see the cost
[9798.96 → 9801.12] is tough for USB
[9801.12 → 9803.28] because you either have to do individual
[9803.28 → 9805.12] fibre I would say I would say I mean
[9805.12 → 9806.48] infinite cables has a lot of perfect
[9806.48 → 9808.72] products for this um i would
[9808.72 → 9810.56] definitely endorse their products in
[9810.56 → 9812.16] general and then I would probably go
[9812.16 → 9814.48] fibre optic USB to a dock
[9814.48 → 9817.04] um and then I would probably go I'd
[9817.04 → 9818.96] probably go HDMI right now, but we're on
[9818.96 → 9821.76] the verge of GPUs that support newer
[9821.76 → 9824.00] DisplayPort standards like the new HBR
[9824.00 → 9824.80] standards
[9824.80 → 9826.88] I don't know how many HBR cables exist
[9826.88 → 9828.08] yet though so that's something you'd
[9828.08 → 9829.28] probably have to look into for yourself
[9829.28 → 9831.20] but I've been very happy with uh infinite
[9831.20 → 9833.28] cables
[9833.28 → 9835.52] Jake would be proud I promoted infinite
[9835.52 → 9837.28] cables shout out infinite cable
[9837.28 → 9840.24] yeah do you think anyone will create SSD
[9840.24 → 9842.08] technology that will be as good as
[9842.08 → 9845.84] 3d x point no
[9845.84 → 9848.56] I mean someday, someday maybe, but it looks
[9848.56 → 9850.16] like we're on NAND flash for the time
[9850.16 → 9851.20] being
[9851.20 → 9853.12] I miss octane actually I don't miss
[9853.12 → 9855.44] octane I have octane in my uh in my
[9855.44 → 9856.32] machine at home
[9856.32 → 9858.32] I treated myself to an octane I was like
[9858.32 → 9859.84] I'm going to have an octane
[9859.84 → 9864.32] and now I do
[9864.32 → 9866.72] I don't even have a current gen uh like
[9866.72 → 9869.28] 40 series GPU I went AMD
[9869.28 → 9871.04] because you know that was out of spite i
[9871.04 → 9872.64] had to go AMD yeah it was you didn't go
[9872.64 → 9874.48] octane out of spite no I didn't I love
[9874.48 → 9878.56] octane
[9878.56 → 9881.12] they're so expensive they're a lot
[9881.12 → 9886.64] cheaper now
[9886.64 → 9889.60] oh man hey DLL what are your opinions on
[9889.60 → 9891.20] all the different types of screen
[9891.20 → 9892.08] protectors
[9892.08 → 9895.84] plastic glass and liquid my family keeps
[9895.84 → 9897.60] asking me about liquid screen protectors
[9897.60 → 9898.72] and I don't know what to tell them
[9898.72 → 9901.52] well tell them glass hold on we did a
[9901.52 → 9903.84] thing it actually worked surprisingly
[9903.84 → 9907.36] well it did but still I have no idea if
[9907.36 → 9909.68] this brand or product even like exists
[9909.68 → 9912.80] any more probably not um here it is 12
[9912.80 → 9915.12] years ago let's go what a thumbnail i
[9915.12 → 9918.72] know right real world test dragging phones
[9918.72 → 9919.68] behind my motorbike
[9919.68 → 9924.32] minus tech tips in the title I know right
[9928.96 → 9931.60] so here you go liquid armour invisible
[9931.60 → 9934.80] whatever here are some dummy phones and uh
[9934.80 → 9937.44] this is me filming yeah notice how I don't
[9937.44 → 9937.76] zoom
[9937.76 → 9940.32] yeah yeah yeah he just walks look at him
[9940.32 → 9942.88] walk that's a Luke foot put that on your
[9942.88 → 9944.80] weird foot fetish website yeah I had those
[9944.80 → 9947.20] stupid white shoes for so long and then he
[9947.20 → 9949.92] had to run because I was like you know on
[9949.92 → 9952.00] a motor vehicle
[9952.00 → 9955.36] um yeah, and then we inspected them and we
[9955.36 → 9956.00] found that they were like
[9956.00 → 9957.76] oh why did we do a black bear
[9959.60 → 9961.68] they were just dummy phones oh okay that
[9961.68 → 9962.32] makes sense yeah
[9962.88 → 9966.08] just like the key this filming quality is
[9966.08 → 9969.28] this the best it can do oh no here we go
[9969.28 → 9972.32] okay look at those shoes' oh those are
[9972.32 → 9973.52] motorcycle boots what do you want from
[9973.52 → 9976.40] me yeah but yeah we found that like you
[9976.40 → 9978.32] could actually the film was still on
[9978.32 → 9979.84] there focus on the ground Luke yeah
[9979.84 → 9980.32] yeah yeah yeah
[9980.32 → 9982.00] still on their yeah yeah yeah
[9982.00 → 9983.76] Luke doesn't that doesn't have that's a
[9983.76 → 9985.28] I don't think I ever touched the focus
[9985.28 → 9986.88] no it just was what it was yeah it was
[9986.88 → 9989.04] what it was raw it's raw this is a
[9989.04 → 9990.64] different time okay it was a different
[9990.64 → 9995.44] time
[9995.44 → 9999.44] the camera that I learned on uh
[9999.44 → 10000.64] was it that you couldn't change the
[10000.64 → 10001.92] zoom no you couldn't change the focus
[10001.92 → 10003.28] right yeah yeah I don't think it had
[10003.28 → 10005.60] manual focus yeah yeah and there's a
[10005.60 → 10007.60] scratch on the lens anyway incredible
[10008.80 → 10012.16] you've come so far no, no I mean the
[10012.16 → 10014.72] the company is okay I was like i never
[10014.72 → 10016.56] got better at filming you work in it now
[10018.08 → 10019.84] this is what we were using at that point
[10019.84 → 10022.56] yeah, yeah stereo microphone let's go
[10023.84 → 10025.20] yeah I think ours was white or something
[10025.20 → 10025.76] though wasn't it
[10026.48 → 10028.72] nope oh not even a little what was that
[10028.72 → 10030.56] camera I remember some sx1 is
[10030.56 → 10035.12] oh the good octane deals on new egg
[10035.12 → 10036.16] seem to have dried up
[10037.28 → 10039.12] I was just checking there was a while
[10039.12 → 10040.88] there where you could get like some pretty
[10040.88 → 10043.92] sick octane deals on just like old octane
[10043.92 → 10047.04] drives but uh it does not appear to be a
[10047.04 → 10048.96] thing right now I think do you know how many
[10048.96 → 10051.12] do you know how many of those cameras you
[10051.12 → 10052.64] could buy with the three that we're doing on
[10052.64 → 10053.84] Sancho right now
[10053.84 → 10055.52] a lot 114
[10057.68 → 10059.76] well let's like use them for a change then
[10059.76 → 10060.80] there you go yeah
[10060.80 → 10062.24] we should do we should do like matrix
[10062.24 → 10064.24] bullet time just buy like an incredible
[10064.24 → 10065.92] amount of those cameras and just put them all
[10065.92 → 10068.56] I bet I want to get PTZ in here so that we
[10068.56 → 10070.64] can have like one camera, and then it can
[10070.64 → 10073.20] move and zoom between you guys PTZ point
[10073.20 → 10075.52] tilt zoom oh or pan tilt zoom
[10077.92 → 10080.16] hey there are deals one bay though 350 bucks
[10080.16 → 10081.68] for one and a half terabyte data centre
[10081.68 → 10082.16] drive
[10082.16 → 10084.96] dang let's go oh I just wanted one for my
[10084.96 → 10085.60] swap drive
[10086.72 → 10088.24] oh well just get these little guys these
[10088.24 → 10090.00] little guys are cheap
[10090.88 → 10092.32] they're cheap
[10094.16 → 10096.80] but yeah I treated myself a little
[10096.80 → 10099.68] while ago to an octane that's nice yeah
[10100.48 → 10101.76] I deserve it yeah
[10103.20 → 10105.04] okay what are we thinking about the si2 that
[10105.04 → 10106.24] was silver before that
[10107.52 → 10109.60] uh we never had one of those we had some
[10109.60 → 10112.00] camera that was white we had some uh like
[10112.00 → 10114.48] Sony handy cam silver thing for maybe that's
[10114.48 → 10116.48] what I'm thinking yeah yeah okay yeah
[10117.44 → 10120.40] hey wan. Dill question for all three of you
[10120.40 → 10122.64] what has been your favourite tech or related
[10122.64 → 10125.44] product that has had a big influence in your
[10125.44 → 10130.72] daily lives this year daily oh my snapdragon
[10130.72 → 10133.04] laptop it's not perfect I had this problem
[10133.04 → 10134.24] it's not perfect I had this problem
[10134.24 → 10136.56] but um the battery life is a game changer for me
[10136.56 → 10137.76] there I'm going to go with that
[10139.04 → 10142.24] daily life it has to be tech not software tech
[10142.24 → 10145.44] favourite tech or related product I would say software is related to tech
[10149.28 → 10151.60] Luke really likes the new lid for our water bottles
[10151.60 → 10155.20] no he doesn't
[10157.04 → 10160.16] you whine about them, I like a lot of other things the reviews are perfect
[10160.16 → 10164.40] though people like them that's good they're easy to clean that is good they're sanitary that
[10164.40 → 10169.92] Luke's just not a guy who cares about sanitation no i just already cleaned my water no I get it
[10169.92 → 10172.96] I get it you're just a dirty boy a dirty chicken boy
[10175.60 → 10179.36] I need to start I need to start eating something else I can't, I can't uh i have to
[10179.36 → 10182.88] escape this whole chicken thing um you could move to poultry you'll never
[10186.16 → 10186.96] Christmas bird
[10189.52 → 10194.08] I don't think there's any particular piece of tech that had like an outstanding impact on my life this
[10194.08 → 10200.24] year to be honest all right then the laptop I have for work is super normal nothing else really changed
[10200.24 → 10208.08] my computer got a lot cooler yeah he's a Bulbasaur computer does it like work now
[10208.88 → 10212.64] yeah it worked the whole time well no you had issues with it at first oh yeah whatever I fixed
[10212.64 → 10217.04] those okay so it works now yeah yeah, and it's still cool like all the stuff still in it and everything
[10217.04 → 10223.12] generally there's you know some of the moss decided to leave yeah um, and it was real moss so like yeah
[10223.84 → 10228.56] no there's still real moss in their yeah that is still green oh yeah moss is crazy yeah um
[10228.56 → 10233.84] um and there's some there are some stickers that I had to trim and every once in a while one of the
[10233.84 → 10240.48] stickers will decide to join the fans and then I have to trim it as well yep that makes sense I mean
[10240.48 → 10244.16] we did sticker bomb your fans so yeah I'm probably going to have to do that again this weekend because
[10244.16 → 10248.56] it is ticking again yeah, and it's doing the type of ticking that I know it's not actually bad it's
[10248.56 → 10252.88] just a sticker in the fan yeah so I just got to go in there and swoop, and then it's fine how about
[10252.88 → 10260.00] the nine pro uh don't I have an eight pro that shows you how much uh he thinks about it and i
[10260.00 → 10266.96] how life-changing it was don't like it that much yeah all right cool as someone who is the techie of
[10266.96 → 10271.36] the family how do you recommend handling overwhelming requests to fix various items
[10271.36 → 10279.68] and electronics say no politely sometimes also I need the opposite my parents like won't tell me when
[10279.68 → 10283.60] there's a problem with their computers and I'm like that's pretty you've been dealing with this
[10283.60 → 10289.76] for so long, and you didn't say anything like oh that's actually funny or when they'll be up or worse
[10289.76 → 10293.60] when they'll buy something without asking if it's any good and those are my absolute
[10293.60 → 10298.00] why I didn't want to bother you yeah you're bothering me now it's bothered me so much more
[10299.52 → 10303.28] I know another one is like you want to like upgrade someone's computer, but they won't
[10303.92 → 10310.48] like sort their files so you can get them a new drive it's like come on help me help you please
[10311.76 → 10318.96] oh man I have I'm supposed to Emma's supposed to be on Geodude now computer name yeah it's old amethyst

[10402.64 → 10410.64] custom Linus tech tips Peria z2 giveaway so why did I why did they why did they reach out here's
[10410.64 → 10421.52] a to-do list I sent to myself here's a to-do list from me to what nick that's just like stuff to do

[10469.52 → 10474.56] we're reaching out to see if you'd be interested in doing a giveaway of a custom Linus tech tips
[10474.56 → 10481.28] branded Peria z2 you can check out the different material types on our new website here we've found
[10481.28 → 10487.36] that the Peria z2 is a prime candidate for our skins the glass surfaces are prone to scratching
[10487.36 → 10493.44] but they're also ideal canvases for textured skins they apply easily and can be infinitely removed and
[10493.44 → 10498.88] reused oh really that must have been an old feature if you're game just let us know your delivery
[10498.88 → 10506.56] address, and we'll get working on the custom skinned device talk to you soon signed a robot uh I said that
[10506.56 → 10509.76] that sounds appealing do you mind if I work the giveaway and d run messaging into a review of the
[10509.76 → 10514.80] experience z2 would be similar to how I did this one and I linked our HTC you're also way too formal
[10514.80 → 10524.00] this is so old is this 2013 uh 2014. ah, hi Linus that would definitely work for us would the device be
[10524.00 → 10531.04] skinned throughout the entire review video we obviously only ask that it is if we only ask that it is if you
[10531.04 → 10537.04] genuinely like the way the skin feels and the purpose it achieves oh this is adorable 2d brand
[10537.04 → 10543.20] from Linus the device would be skinned throughout Linus perfect can you send over a vector file with
[10543.20 → 10548.40] your logo so we can get started also do you have any preference in materials and oh this is
[10548.40 → 10553.28] great so you were starting to lose some attention span near the end there uh yeah okay, okay
[10553.28 → 10563.92] yeah those big single letter k energy I hand it off to ed um yeah wow this is uh yeah this is crazy so
[10563.92 → 10570.40] uh yeah apparently he's I've heard I've heard the story told such that they like moved heaven and
[10570.40 → 10576.48] earth to make this happen because they were believed very strongly in like influencer marketing very
[10576.48 → 10584.24] early on like that's way ahead of the curve did really well they were way ahead um and like I guess
[10584.24 → 10589.52] they reached out before they even like had one of these experience e2 phones I don't know why they
[10589.52 → 10596.96] reached out about the phone maybe I mentioned it on Twitter or something I don't remember oh but yeah no
[10596.96 → 10602.56] it started out very cordial, and now it's devolved into what it is now so um so them sending you phones
[10602.56 → 10610.24] with skins on them to do like reviews on is been there from the entire start yeah yeah since 2014
[10611.12 → 10616.32] and they've been perfect at like their um at like their product imagery and stuff like even way
[10616.32 → 10621.92] back then there's an experience e2 with you know their cool uh kind of leather looking one and they
[10621.92 → 10627.12] used to have like a brushed metal one because that was cool back then, but it isn't now all right what
[10627.12 → 10632.48] else we got a few more here hey DLL long time listener first time live what is your favourite
[10632.48 → 10636.80] or most interesting computer build that you've done or been involved with including any you've
[10636.80 → 10643.04] had to disassemble to put back together man I don't know we kind of did a video talking about a lot of
[10643.04 → 10647.12] these recently yeah maybe check that out yeah I think that's probably the best way to answer this
[10647.12 → 10652.32] question is to just link you to a video yeah or best builds or something
[10654.64 → 10661.36] yeah I think I can find it reacting to our best pc builds ever this one right here yeah it's good video
[10663.36 → 10674.40] the first line is hair it's good time i LLD trying to get a deal on a RTX 4090 and try to eBay
[10674.40 → 10680.72] there are many new cards for under 800 from China I know it's likely to be a scam but how would the
[10680.72 → 10684.64] scam work since eBay has buyer protection that's a perfect question and one I've actually been
[10684.64 → 10689.12] trying to figure out for a long time because I've run into the same thing with like entry level cards
[10689.12 → 10694.00] as well we've covered those scam GPUs a number of times and I get it when you're buying from
[10694.00 → 10700.08] somewhere that doesn't have buyer protection um and the way that those like cheap scam cards work
[10700.08 → 10705.60] is they are functional GPUs they're just like old ones are they just hoping that you don't know um
[10705.60 → 10711.52] but with something like a RTX 4090 because so the idea is that those scam ones they like work well
[10711.52 → 10717.36] enough to work for a bit, and then you know give them time to get your money and like to run away and
[10717.36 → 10725.60] disappear whereas with something like uh like a RTX 4090 I don't really yeah I don't really understand um
[10727.04 → 10736.16] how that would work yeah see here's one here so apparently a supposedly new 4090 I don't know maybe i
[10736.16 → 10741.36] should just maybe I should buy one why don't we find out how the scam works there's a video yeah
[10742.40 → 10748.00] all right sure I'll buy this scam 4090 right now I'm going to send this to procurement and uh
[10748.56 → 10751.52] draw my credit card which we're not mean so that means he'll buy it on Monday
[10752.40 → 10759.76] please buy this okay and then yeah let's let's seen what happens all right
[10759.76 → 10766.00] cool people are saying no core no VRAM but like buyer protection so like should I get
[10767.20 → 10776.08] should I get my money probably right oh hey uh Pia VPN it was down there oh there it had our vanity
[10776.08 → 10781.28] URL yeah the banner was there oh you just wanted to like to say it yeah I mean they're our VPN sponsor
[10781.28 → 10789.28] what do you want okay hey Daniel yeah, yeah nice they paid for this show too when after dark there it is
[10789.28 → 10798.24] oh nice sick Pia uh are they bros liked brand no they're bros in a completely different way yeah
[10798.24 → 10804.72] yeah they really are though yeah they are just like I don't know who do you do whatever you want
[10805.28 → 10811.20] here's some money I guess yeah okay it's its kind of bizarre liked brand's very high touch
[10813.12 → 10818.08] whereas Pia is just like hey you have a portal login why are you talking to me promote it like
[10818.08 → 10823.36] however you guys think is good like I mean we're paying you we're probably not going to watch it so
[10823.36 → 10832.96] yeah take notes every company it's actually like it's kind of wild yeah it's pretty cool
[10832.96 → 10840.64] well the new wan hoodie have the thumb section my wife stole my old hoodie no I hope not yeah okay oh
[10840.64 → 10846.24] it's gone this time sorry it was very polarizing, and we've decided to not have it this time yeah interesting
[10846.24 → 10854.32] yeah evening gents ordered the precision screwdriver and the AI told me that the bits from my Ltd
[10854.32 → 10859.20] screwdriver would work not the case can you guys fix that because I trusted that lol
[10860.32 → 10867.52] oh you trusted what the AI apparently our AI on the store what or email must be email because we have
[10867.52 → 10873.20] email AI responses uh yeah they are a different shank size um sorry about that
[10874.96 → 10881.60] hey I'm assuming that we'll take care of that uh yeah contact support yeah tell them you want a human
[10881.60 → 10883.44] that is an option in the emails yeah
[10886.48 → 10893.20] hey LDT random business question I recently took a position supervising 17 people, and it's tough to do
[10893.20 → 10897.36] efficiently how many direct reports are you generally comfortable with managers having
[10899.36 → 10901.44] six to eight Luke
[10904.08 → 10905.44] yeah is that per company or
[10907.28 → 10913.12] hey uh yeah in that regard I'm doing okay yeah, but you have sub managers so technically you only have
[10913.12 → 10919.04] like one or two no, no that's not correct at some companies let's just carry on
[10919.04 → 10924.88] uh that's not even true in one department he does well I still think you should write a book on
[10924.88 → 10931.04] management uh my best friend owns a recycling company and has offered me free parts to make my
[10931.04 → 10937.04] hex OS server what do I even want to consider when I get servers at cost per pound I would say energy
[10937.04 → 10943.12] efficiency so rather than Nessus because obviously this is older stuff right so you're not going to be
[10943.12 → 10947.68] looking at like a know 12 core processors or whatever so if you're is you're going to have
[10947.68 → 10951.68] something that's basically just going to be a storage server then I would say get something with
[10951.68 → 10959.28] fewer cores that use less energy um get the newest thing you can um I would look for something with
[10959.28 → 10966.00] PCIE slots so that you can put has in so you can add more drives in the future um what else would
[10966.00 → 10971.36] you consider I mean if reliability is really important to you maybe find an actual server that has a
[10971.36 → 10977.04] redundant power supply just could be loud in fact Jake and I filmed the video this week oh man we built
[10977.04 → 10982.88] the coolest server we took one of our old 45 drive store-senators, and we converted the front to NVMe
[10983.92 → 10989.60] left 30 hard drives in the back and then upgraded the back so that we could fill it with
[10989.60 → 10996.08] uh like PCIE to the front bay things and then has, and then we put a GPU above it just for compute
[10996.08 → 11001.44] oh that you can't even like access the rear Io of and like sure we put Noctua fans in, and we put a
[11001.44 → 11006.16] custom front panel oh dude it's so cool anyway the point is uh what was I talking about recycle
[11006.16 → 11010.40] computer stuff power efficiency oh yeah yeah one of the things that we did was I don't have
[11010.40 → 11014.96] a redundant power supply any more we just put in a high quality single power supply because the
[11014.96 → 11020.48] redundant power supply was so flipping loud that's probably okay i would stress test the things
[11020.48 → 11029.52] that you're getting out of the recycling area smart burn in yeah a couple more oh oh oh hold on
[11030.00 → 11037.84] uh a robot from d-brand I feel like this from oh no watching the show uh can be infinitely removed
[11037.84 → 11044.88] and reused for what it's worth this statement genuinely did apply specifically to the Peria z2
[11044.88 → 11050.16] due to the glass back surface of course low surface energy bond between the adhesive and
[11050.16 → 11055.60] the non-porous glass surface okay thank you very much for the clarification didn't care didn't really
[11055.60 → 11063.04] ask but uh you keep doing stickers you absolute mad robots proud of what they do you know yeah
[11066.56 → 11070.96] too long didn't read I'm sorry to hear that or good for you whatever
[11070.96 → 11079.28] my god hey DLL any more tall versions of the apparel coming soon for Luke Dan and i
[11081.04 → 11087.76] sorry what are there more tall versions of the apparel dude i in the last meeting I advocated for
[11087.76 → 11093.76] something that's upcoming that is not getting a tall version but I tried look it sure you did but
[11093.76 → 11100.80] the motor quantities are hard, and they have to grade an entire another set of sizes how many of how much
[11100.80 → 11109.20] total sales went through the tall blanks I don't know no okay I wonder yeah we got our foot in
[11109.20 → 11115.68] the door Dan we got our foot in the door yep the new blanks I heard not immediately maybe but eventually
[11116.72 → 11121.12] they're going to be tells which might mean that we might have more colours than just the black t-shirt
[11121.12 → 11126.80] yeah my understanding was that if the tells did okay then they would explore more we're going to get
[11126.80 → 11131.28] baby steps we're going to get more I saw someone ask about the like Wang sweater and the
[11131.28 → 11135.20] sweater and tall size and I was like no that's like that's not oh that's actually the one yeah
[11135.20 → 11139.28] that's the one I was talking about this and no I just did not have that would be brutal that's a pretty
[11139.28 → 11145.36] complicated garment isn't it rough yeah, yeah like i I appreciate that we're we're getting there
[11145.36 → 11149.28] and we're actually taking the baby steps now I understand it's weird I understand it's a little bit
[11149.28 → 11153.68] niche it's nice to have some stuff that does actually like to fit me though I know we're working on it
[11153.68 → 11158.88] so it is cool I do appreciate it i all there's also the cargo pants we're getting
[11159.84 → 11165.04] in 32 length if I remember correctly yeah that's exciting too yep what's the waist well different
[11165.04 → 11170.96] ways yeah yeah oh okay so we're doing a whole another sizing grade of the cargo pants oh okay which by the way
[11176.56 → 11182.00] oh cool I don't know what you're talking about that actually looks really sharp I don't know what you're
[11182.00 → 11185.84] talking about wow i actually I really like that colour I don't know what you're talking about
[11187.84 → 11194.00] wow that looks genuinely very good it's like a purple blue this is a very early sample and no
[11194.00 → 11198.48] no promises it looks great though I get all kinds of stuff that just like never sees the light of day
[11198.48 → 11205.28] so like yeah I watched uh the flow plane exclusive with Tatiana talking about like the socks and stuff
[11205.28 → 11214.32] oh she was going over how you could send her different pictures and stuff I was like yeah
[11214.32 → 11222.32] this all just sounds like this is all completely believable I've sent her some horrible
[11222.32 → 11227.12] pictures oh she yeah she said as much did she okay I didn't watch if it was honestly a perfect
[11227.12 → 11231.52] video yeah I have sent her some awful pictures that nobody should ever have to see
[11231.52 → 11239.52] I look i I was like I'm all about consent to so like I was like hey I did not send you pictures
[11239.52 → 11245.84] of what this did to my feet um because nobody needs to see that, and she's like yo i for product
[11245.84 → 11250.96] development purposes I actually do need these pictures oh no all right brother I don't know i
[11250.96 → 11258.08] feel like she said not that in the video what no I whoa okay hold on whoa I take exception I take
[11258.08 → 11262.88] exception to this I take exception since I watched it but I thought she was like you know I don't need
[11262.88 → 11267.60] to see hold on I don't need to see your blisters what's going on with miss dégagé here hold on a
[11267.60 → 11272.96] second flagging for super soft flagging for hold on where's it everyone what you're here hold on a
[11272.96 → 11280.24] second I've been what you're saying socks hold on don't think out loud i I would not send people a
[11280.24 → 11288.72] horrible picture unless there was a reason here we go uh hold on oh here I found the thread
[11290.40 → 11295.60] one session two hours and I have a picture of
[11297.76 → 11303.92] like what happened to the socks they are immediately like scuffed this was a was a sample that i
[11303.92 → 11310.16] rejected you can see how they fuzzed yeah after two hours of playing badminton I have uglier pictures on my
[11310.16 → 11314.64] phone of the red spots and blisters caused by the slipperiness of the insides they slip like dress
[11314.64 → 11319.84] socks they need to be less slide can show you if you really want to see but in a nutshell it hurts
[11319.84 → 11324.00] lol she says this is Tatiana thank you for letting me know although kind of disappointing with the
[11324.00 → 11326.88] vendor that the issue is not really improved I'm going to schedule a call with the vendor to better
[11326.88 → 11330.32] communicate her requirements and that this cannot persist for her to continue sampling with them very
[11330.32 → 11336.24] professional emails she was I think pretty new uh at that point hi Linus after relaying the above
[11336.24 → 11340.00] info to the vendor they have some follow-up questions to better tackle this issue one your shoe size and
[11340.00 → 11344.48] your routine movements during your two-hour session two they want photos of the whole sock or just feel
[11344.48 → 11349.04] free to bring them tomorrow during merch meeting and I can take the photos to send out three also i
[11349.04 → 11352.64] want to know the position of the blisters and red spots on your foot to make adjustments to the design
[11352.64 → 11358.08] thank you for your help with this I said size eight attached footage of this Thursday session I put in
[11358.08 → 11363.84] my backpack photos of feet attached not for faint of heart I do not have nice feet lol she says thank you
[11363.84 → 11368.00] for the warning lol and the video I'll grab the socks from you tomorrow and send all these points out to the
[11368.00 → 11373.60] Deventer she asked for it, she asked for the position she didn't ask for a photo what I'm gonna what I'm
[11373.60 → 11378.56] going to put coordinates I'm going to put latitude and longitude on my feet 30 degrees south
[11383.04 → 11387.12] I think sending the picture at that point is reasonable but I am just saying she didn't technically
[11387.12 → 11393.52] ask for a picture I'll let you guys be the judge it's hard yeah you can't do everything anyway Tatiana is
[11393.52 → 11398.80] great she's doing a great job, and we do have a strong candidate we do have a strong candidate for
[11398.80 → 11405.76] maybe a LTT sock at some point yeah heck yeah, yeah last one I've got for you tonight hey there DLL

[11495.76 → 11501.68] screwdriver company with like a media production team attached to it like it's crazy we aren't the
[11501.68 → 11511.12] media company is still the uh the bigger one, but it's big dog it's wild it's wild it's also hilarious
[11511.12 → 11517.20] to see people still talking about how it's a ten dollar you know AliExpress you know rebadge or whatever
[11517.20 → 11522.16] like um on DIY park's video he's promoting the screwdriver as part of the sponsorship and like
[11522.16 → 11525.76] some of the replies are just like I don't know how anyone could be gullible enough to buy that it's
[11525.76 → 11530.64] like I don't know how you could be gullible enough to read everything you read on the internet
[11531.92 → 11540.48] because it's your you someone lied to you, and you just have been uninformed for two years yeah enjoy that yeah
[11540.48 → 11550.08] um yeah are there like I don't so I'm trying to think like go watch reviews and then I'll see like
[11550.08 → 11555.68] is there any actually negative reviews I don't think so I don't think so it's a good product what do you
[11555.68 → 11560.24] want like yeah, but some people are just like mad they're just like mad about that they don't like that
[11560.24 → 11568.88] yeah they just really want it to be bad yeah okay manifesting does not actually work, and again it might
[11568.88 → 11575.76] be expensive oh yeah sure yep it is expensive for a screwdriver yep, yep cool
